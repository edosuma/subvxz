00:08.258 --> 00:09.676
<i>Previously on </i>Riverdale:

00:09.759 --> 00:13.138
Archie Andrews.
I'm Special Agent Adams with the FBI.

00:13.221 --> 00:16.016
We believe Hiram Lodge is conducting
criminal activity.

00:16.099 --> 00:18.643
You are at a unique position
to help us take him down.

00:18.727 --> 00:21.646
I need assurance from you.
No matter what happens to Mr. Lodge

00:21.730 --> 00:24.149
-my dad is gonna be okay.
-I can protect your father.

00:24.232 --> 00:27.610
Effective immediately,
Southside High School is shut down.

00:27.694 --> 00:30.530
-Well, it's done.
-After a few weeks, we'll quietly go about

00:30.613 --> 00:32.991
purchasing the land
beneath Southside High.

00:33.074 --> 00:36.536
And you will get your sizable donation
to your reelection campaign.

00:36.619 --> 00:38.121
And, Daddy, this is...

00:38.204 --> 00:41.374
Archie Andrews. The boy
who's captured my daughter's heart.

00:41.458 --> 00:44.252
-I hope we can respect each other.
-Of course, Mr. Lodge.

00:44.586 --> 00:47.046
No more sneaking
into my daughter's bedroom.

00:47.630 --> 00:48.548
Ever.

00:48.631 --> 00:52.135
You wanted me to get a job, and I did.
Providing comfort and companionship

00:52.677 --> 00:54.554
to the lonely men of Riverdale.

00:54.637 --> 00:57.223
You remember that baby
my mom put up for adoption?

00:57.307 --> 00:59.934
-Hey, let go of my brother!

01:00.018 --> 01:01.019
You'll be safe here.

01:06.191 --> 01:10.862
<i>One week after Riverdale High's</i>
<i>absorption of its Southside counterpart,</i>

01:10.945 --> 01:12.655
<i>and everything was the same.</i>

01:15.784 --> 01:17.577
<i>And nothing was the same.</i>

01:18.411 --> 01:19.829
<i>Take Archie Andrews.</i>

01:19.913 --> 01:22.582
<i>On the surface,</i>
<i>he's getting ready for basketball tryouts,</i>

01:22.665 --> 01:24.167
<i>as he does every winter.</i>

01:25.126 --> 01:27.003
<i>But underneath, he was churning.</i>

01:27.086 --> 01:31.508
<i>His life in chaos</i>
<i>after an unexpected visit from the feds.</i>

01:31.591 --> 01:35.470
<i>Meanwhile, the town was preparing</i>
<i>to honor its founding father,</i>

01:35.553 --> 01:37.722
<i>General Augustus Pickens.</i> Mr. Jones. Eyes up front.

01:41.434 --> 01:42.685
Thank you, Mrs. Haggly.

01:44.562 --> 01:46.272
As I was saying,

01:47.148 --> 01:49.442
each year,
we honor the memory of General Pickens.

01:49.526 --> 01:52.028
Yet few know the truth.

01:53.655 --> 01:56.282
That it was
my great-great-great-grandpappy,

01:56.366 --> 01:57.742
Colonel Barnabas B. Blossom,

01:57.826 --> 01:59.994
who bankrolled
General Pickens' settlement of...

02:00.787 --> 02:02.914
an Eden along the river of Sweetwater,

02:03.623 --> 02:05.792
where maple trees grow taller
than the steeples

02:05.875 --> 02:09.003
of Europe's grandest cathedrals,
which is why, every year,

02:09.087 --> 02:11.506
I petition the mayor's office
to rename Pickens Day--

02:12.674 --> 02:14.509
Thank you for that, Cheryl.

02:15.969 --> 02:20.056
Mr. Jones, we look forward
to your oral history report next week.

02:20.765 --> 02:23.643
The students we transferred
to Riverdale High are fine,

02:23.726 --> 02:26.396
but their parents are in my office,
every day,

02:26.479 --> 02:28.481
wanting me to reopen Southside High.

02:28.565 --> 02:31.860
Which is why we've been discussing
how our new neighborhood

02:31.943 --> 02:34.028
could use something positive to focus on.

02:34.112 --> 02:37.407
With your blessing,
we'd like to make Pickens Day bigger,

02:37.490 --> 02:38.908
more of a celebratory event.

02:38.992 --> 02:40.994
Sponsored by Lodge Industries.

02:41.077 --> 02:43.037
And Andrews Construction co-sponsoring.

02:43.121 --> 02:47.709
You mean you wanna turn Pickens Day
into a commercial for your SoDale project.

02:47.792 --> 02:49.252
Like your open house.

02:49.335 --> 02:51.170
Au contraire, Madam Mayor.

02:51.921 --> 02:53.923
The open house was for investors.

02:54.591 --> 02:58.219
But this event would be
for North- and Southsiders alike.

02:58.303 --> 03:00.138
Two halves of a whole coming together--

03:00.221 --> 03:03.766
To distract people with a party?
What if it backfires, things get violent?

03:03.850 --> 03:07.186
What about the Serpents?
They've been quiet, but they're wildcards.

03:07.270 --> 03:09.564
-They could cause trouble.
We've thought of that.

03:09.647 --> 03:11.733
We're offered to hire them
as event security.

03:11.816 --> 03:13.818
Fred, you're on board with this?

03:13.902 --> 03:16.321
Well, FP told me the Serpents
are looking for work.

03:16.404 --> 03:18.197
Figure we let them keep the peace.

03:18.740 --> 03:21.451
You had your reasons
for closing down Southside High,

03:21.534 --> 03:24.370
but this is an opportunity
to let the Southside know

03:24.454 --> 03:27.040
-you're not turning your back on them.
-Hey, Dad.

03:27.206 --> 03:28.750
-Hey, bud.
-Archie.

03:29.542 --> 03:30.543
Sorry to interrupt.

03:30.627 --> 03:33.838
-Actually, we're just finishing up.

03:33.922 --> 03:34.797
Mm-hm.

03:34.881 --> 03:36.507
-Thanks, Fred, for having us.
-Yeah.

03:36.591 --> 03:38.760
Madam Mayor,
you'll let us know in the morning?

03:40.053 --> 03:42.430
-Hey, Mr. Lodge.
-Excuse me, Archie.

03:46.517 --> 03:47.435
Hey.

03:47.518 --> 03:48.519
Oh, um...

03:48.603 --> 03:50.313
I'd kiss you, but you're sweaty.

03:51.814 --> 03:55.026
So, how long do you plan
on staying with us, Chic?

03:55.109 --> 03:56.486
For as long as he wants.

03:56.569 --> 03:58.529
I'm just trying to plan my life, Alice.

03:59.530 --> 04:03.534
And since we're not getting any answers
about anything...

04:03.868 --> 04:05.411
What would you like to know, Hal?

04:05.495 --> 04:07.956
For starters,
Betty brought you here all bloody.

04:08.039 --> 04:09.624
Why

04:09.707 --> 04:10.541
Dad.

04:10.959 --> 04:12.502
You don't have to, Chic

04:14.212 --> 04:16.923
The person who attacked me,
his name's Marcel.

04:17.298 --> 04:20.718
He runs the hostel.
Sometimes he books clients for us.

04:21.511 --> 04:24.347
The night you showed up, Betty,
I wasn't in the mood to work.

04:24.472 --> 04:26.432
Marcel was trying
to convince me otherwise.

04:26.516 --> 04:29.852
-Hal.

04:29.936 --> 04:31.312
No, I wanna know, too.

04:31.396 --> 04:32.230
Betty.

04:32.313 --> 04:33.398
All kinds.

04:33.481 --> 04:36.734
Ranging from nice to, hell,
even nastier than Marcel.

04:36.818 --> 04:40.363
I, uh, can go into specifics,
if you'd like.

04:40.446 --> 04:43.116
I've also got a good collection
of scars I could show you.

04:43.199 --> 04:44.367
I have scars, too.

04:45.493 --> 04:47.203
Crescent moons on my palms.

04:47.287 --> 04:48.913
From digging your nails in?

04:49.455 --> 04:51.749
-Yeah.
-Yeah, I used to do that, too.

04:53.918 --> 04:55.003
Syrup.

04:59.382 --> 05:03.594
If and when the U.S. government
brings actions against Hiram Lodge

05:04.012 --> 05:06.389
before any domestic court of law,

05:06.639 --> 05:08.725
that agreement
ensures your father's immunity.

05:08.808 --> 05:12.020
This is nuts. The Lodges were just
at my house planning a party.

05:12.103 --> 05:14.605
Who was there?
-Last night.

05:15.064 --> 05:19.152
And it was Mr. and Mrs. Lodge, my dad,
the sheriff, Mayor McCoy, and--

05:19.819 --> 05:20.820
That's it.

05:20.903 --> 05:23.740
-I was playing basketball.

05:23.823 --> 05:25.992
Agent Adams,
what can we do to speed things up?

05:26.534 --> 05:30.246
I just-- I wanna get through this,
and back to my life, my normal life.

05:30.330 --> 05:33.166
Do you have any relationship
with Hiram Lodge

05:35.168 --> 05:38.212
-Nothing. He doesn't even like me.
-Then let's change that.

05:38.296 --> 05:41.966
You have to establish trust,
get him to lower his guard around you.

05:42.050 --> 05:44.177
The sooner you get access
to his inner circle,

05:44.260 --> 05:46.763
the sooner we'll get what we need
to bring him in.

05:46.846 --> 05:50.767
Then you can go back to playing
in the band with your pals and gals.

05:54.312 --> 05:58.066
Well, he is very fetching
for someone who was living on skid row.

05:58.149 --> 06:01.569
Yeah, he's a hottie who looks
incredibly familiar to me, by the way.

06:01.652 --> 06:04.655
-Maybe if we were allowed -to meet this hottie in person--
Chic is still acclimating.

06:07.825 --> 06:09.619
And I'm trying to get him to trust me,

06:09.702 --> 06:12.038
but my mom is treating him
like he's a 10-year-old,

06:12.121 --> 06:14.707
and my dad's acting
like he's the devil's spawn.

06:14.791 --> 06:16.793
Well, I have an amazing idea.

06:16.876 --> 06:19.420
Bring The Omen to Pickens Day,
and we can all meet him.

06:19.504 --> 06:20.713
Everyone's coming, right?

06:20.797 --> 06:24.759
-No. Because the Serpents weren't invited.
-Serpents were specifically asked to come.

06:24.842 --> 06:28.763
Yeah, to provide security.
Like we're all on the <i>Snowpiercer</i> train,

06:28.846 --> 06:30.848
but the Serpents are
eating the cockroaches.

06:30.932 --> 06:33.226
You don't have to work
if you don't want to.

06:33.309 --> 06:36.562
The damage, as they say,
has already been done.

06:36.646 --> 06:39.524
-I'll talk to you guys later.

06:40.108 --> 06:43.361
Uh, yeah. I'm interviewing her grandfather
for my oral history report.

06:43.694 --> 06:45.113
Oldest living Serpent.

06:51.119 --> 06:52.537
<i>Archie, what is it?</i>

06:53.037 --> 06:58.126
I feel stupid even talking about this,
but... it's about your dad.

06:59.794 --> 07:01.796
I get the feeling
he doesn't really like me.

07:02.463 --> 07:03.297
What?

07:04.382 --> 07:05.675
No, that's not...

07:06.384 --> 07:07.468
That's not true.

07:09.595 --> 07:11.055
Okay, maybe it's a little true,

07:11.139 --> 07:13.975
but it's not anything you're doing,
per se. It's more that...

07:15.143 --> 07:17.478
For starters, you don't speak Spanish.

07:17.562 --> 07:20.064
I can drop French
and start taking Spanish.

07:20.273 --> 07:24.068
-To be honest, yeah.

07:24.152 --> 07:26.779
Do you have any suggestions
on what I can do?

07:27.655 --> 07:29.449
To endear yourself to Daddy?

07:32.368 --> 07:35.496
Well... now that we're talking about it...

07:36.038 --> 07:37.832
What, your dad likes wrestling?

07:37.915 --> 07:41.586
He was captain of Riverdale High's
wrestling team back in the day.

07:41.711 --> 07:45.173
Says it changed his life.
Now that the season's starting back up,

07:45.256 --> 07:47.425
it's like my mom and I
are background extras

07:47.508 --> 07:48.968
in the movie <i>Foxcatcher.</i>

07:49.844 --> 07:51.929
Wrestling

07:52.013 --> 07:54.599
Lodge Industries
basically bankrolls the team.

07:54.682 --> 07:58.019
He was just asking his old coach
if he could sit in on tryouts.

07:59.896 --> 08:03.191
God, Ronnie, you know what's super weird?
I was just telling Reggie

08:03.274 --> 08:05.985
how I was gonna take a break
from basketball this year.

08:06.068 --> 08:08.821
It'd absolutely score you points
with my dad.

08:10.198 --> 08:11.991
<i>Thanks again for meeting with me.</i>

08:12.575 --> 08:15.745
Toni told me that you're one
of the founding members of the Serpents.

08:15.828 --> 08:19.332
Yes. The snake, the laws,
all based on Uktena tradition.

08:20.958 --> 08:23.753
Who were the Uktena?

08:24.337 --> 08:27.798
Uktena is a serpent,
a horned serpent or water serpent.

08:28.341 --> 08:32.094
Before there was Riverdale,
all this land belonged to the Uktena.

08:32.637 --> 08:34.430
How'd the Uktena evolve into Serpents?

08:36.641 --> 08:39.393
The Uktena, we didn't evolve.

08:40.102 --> 08:41.521
We were all slaughtered.

08:42.563 --> 08:45.107
When my grandpa was a baby,
there was a raid.

08:45.191 --> 08:48.611
And it was led by your hero there,
General Pickens,

08:48.694 --> 08:51.030
in a battle, if you wanna call it that.

08:52.949 --> 08:54.867
Only lasted for 12 minutes.

08:55.409 --> 08:58.162
But the slaughter was total and savage.

08:58.663 --> 09:00.373
The General Pickens?

09:01.082 --> 09:03.209
Whose statue stands proudly
in Pickens Park?

09:03.292 --> 09:07.547
Yes. And every year the Northside honors
this man who massacred children.

09:07.630 --> 09:09.048
When my grandpa died,

09:09.131 --> 09:12.093
we formed the Serpents as a way
to keep the family together.

09:12.176 --> 09:15.179
-Ah, some do, but...

09:16.097 --> 09:18.808
It's called the whitewashing of history,
Jones.

09:19.892 --> 09:22.478
What, did you think Jason Blossom
was the first person

09:22.562 --> 09:24.188
to be murdered in Riverdale?

09:28.401 --> 09:31.404
You know I'm down to help,
but why can't it just be the two of us

09:31.487 --> 09:33.322
singing a duet at Pickens Day?

09:33.948 --> 09:37.326
I mean, it could be,
but the Pussycats are a brand.

09:37.410 --> 09:38.786
Why let it sit fallow?

09:41.414 --> 09:44.584
Josie. Veronica. What's this all about?

09:45.668 --> 09:48.754
We are bringing back the Pussycats
to play Pickens Day.

09:48.838 --> 09:50.214
Whose idea was that?

09:50.798 --> 09:52.216
Uh, it was Veronica's.

09:52.300 --> 09:54.468
Weren't we focusing on your solo career?

09:55.011 --> 09:57.888
We could bill it as a special event,
one night only.

09:57.972 --> 09:59.432
I was talking to my daughter.

10:00.266 --> 10:03.394
In fact, why don't we continue
this conversation later

10:03.477 --> 10:04.812
when it's just us two?

10:15.948 --> 10:16.949
Yeah, why?

10:17.491 --> 10:19.410
I just remembered where I know Chic from.

10:19.493 --> 10:22.496
He's a video gigolo,
a webcam boy, a cyber trick.

10:43.267 --> 10:44.101
Mom.

10:45.645 --> 10:49.357
A really weird thing happened
when I was at Josie's last night.

10:49.440 --> 10:52.193
Mayor McCoy was acting
like I was a bad seed,

10:52.276 --> 10:53.778
out to corrupt her daughter.

10:53.861 --> 10:56.030
I don't believe Sierra is comfortable

10:56.572 --> 10:58.949
with how we let you become involved
in the business.

10:59.033 --> 11:02.328
-She's afraid you're gonna tell Josie.

11:02.411 --> 11:04.538
-I'd never--
-Of course not, <i>mija.</i>

11:05.498 --> 11:07.833
And I am not making excuses for Sierra.

11:09.377 --> 11:16.217
In fact, should her coldness persist...
I'll happily have a conversation with her.

11:28.646 --> 11:30.564
Thought basketball was your sport.

11:31.524 --> 11:32.942
-I'm branching out.
-Ah.

11:33.943 --> 11:37.196
-Just, uh, checking out the team.

11:37.571 --> 11:39.281
-I wrestled in high school.

11:39.365 --> 11:41.700
-No, I didn't know that.

11:41.784 --> 11:43.953
One seventy-five,
I'm trying to get down to 170.

11:44.036 --> 11:47.248
Hey, Andrews. It's a good thing
you're not in my weight class.

11:47.331 --> 11:49.166
I'd wreck you, Gingerbread Man.

11:52.795 --> 11:54.004
Let's bring it in.

11:57.883 --> 12:01.429
Firstly, I wanna thank a gentleman
who's really showing his support

12:01.512 --> 12:05.391
for the team this year.
He wrestled for me my first year as coach.

12:05.891 --> 12:10.813
That is Hiram "The Ram" Lodge.
Guys, let's show him some appreciation.

12:15.401 --> 12:16.277
Thank you.

12:18.070 --> 12:21.282
Listen up.
Not everyone will make the team this year.

12:21.824 --> 12:25.828
There'll be cuts every day, boys,
so, make each match count.

12:26.203 --> 12:27.913
All right. Pair off.

12:27.997 --> 12:28.956
Up-and-downs.

12:29.039 --> 12:29.874
Let's go.

12:31.792 --> 12:34.879
You do know wrestling's
not like football or basketball, right?

12:34.962 --> 12:38.048
I went up against Moose
in the Oklahoma Drill, Kev. I'm good.

12:51.729 --> 12:52.897
Thattaboy.

12:53.522 --> 12:54.607
Okay, reset.

12:54.690 --> 12:55.524
Again.

13:08.287 --> 13:10.498
<i>It felt so good, Betty.</i>

13:10.581 --> 13:13.584
It's like, "Archie, you have the physique
of a 1970s porn star,

13:13.667 --> 13:16.754
-but that doesn't mean you can wrestle."
-Speaking of porn stars...

13:16.837 --> 13:19.048
Did you get lost
down a webcam rabbit hole?

13:19.131 --> 13:21.717
It's fascinating.

13:21.800 --> 13:25.721
I brought Chic home to help my mom
without knowing who he was,

13:25.804 --> 13:29.475
and now to find out
he's actually multiple people,

13:29.558 --> 13:31.060
performing online...

13:31.894 --> 13:34.939
How do I broach that with him?
Do I broach that with him?

13:36.398 --> 13:37.775
Hey. Am I interrupting?

13:38.317 --> 13:39.235
-Yeah, kind of--
-No.

13:39.443 --> 13:41.529
I wanted to run stuff by you.
I can come back.

13:41.612 --> 13:42.905
No, no, no, it's fine.

13:44.156 --> 13:44.990
Bye.

13:45.449 --> 13:49.119
By the way, I'm really digging
Kevin's new gossip column.

13:50.287 --> 13:51.247
Readers love it.

13:51.956 --> 13:55.042
And I needed to fill the extra space
when you...

13:55.793 --> 13:58.587
I'm actually working on a story right now.
Here.

13:59.338 --> 14:03.425
When I interviewed Toni's grandfather,
he had some pretty intense things to say

14:03.509 --> 14:06.929
about General Pickens.
But I did some follow-up research.

14:07.012 --> 14:09.848
General Pickens was hired
by Barnabas B. Blossom

14:09.932 --> 14:12.017
to remove the Uktena tribe by force.

14:12.101 --> 14:17.356
Betty, he killed 400 innocent men,
women, and children.

14:17.439 --> 14:19.024
My God, that's horrible.

14:19.108 --> 14:20.442
And adding salt to the wound,

14:20.526 --> 14:22.570
the last remnants of the tribe,
the Serpents,

14:22.653 --> 14:24.321
are being squeezed out of existence.

14:24.405 --> 14:28.117
Toni's grandfather lives
in a trailer the size of a broom closet.

14:28.200 --> 14:31.537
Hiram Lodge is honoring this murderer,
instead of trying to make amends.

14:31.620 --> 14:33.998
I think it's a story we need to tell.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.877
Will you try to get a quote from Hiram?

14:38.627 --> 14:40.170
<i>Kevin told me what happened.</i>

14:44.675 --> 14:46.093
-I'm fine.

14:46.176 --> 14:49.346
Bruised ego, more than anything.
But Kevin's gonna work with me,

14:49.430 --> 14:51.181
-get me up to speed.
-Great.

14:52.266 --> 14:54.977
But should you
not be a natural-born wrestler,

14:55.060 --> 14:57.938
I thought of another way
you might curry my father's favor.

14:58.731 --> 15:02.651
Though Pickens Day is taking a backseat
to his wrestling obsession,

15:02.735 --> 15:05.613
he will be there,
and I suspect he'd be tickled

15:05.696 --> 15:07.698
to see you sing with me and Josie.

15:15.497 --> 15:17.249
Chic. Hey.

15:17.333 --> 15:20.336
-He threw out my stuff.
Who did

15:20.419 --> 15:22.922
Marcel, my landlord, the guy you maced?

15:23.005 --> 15:25.633
He got rid of everything.
Everything I need to survive.

15:25.716 --> 15:29.386
-My laptop, my camera--
And talked to him?

15:29.470 --> 15:32.890
-My entire life was at that hostel.

15:32.973 --> 15:35.392
Like my mom said,
you can stay here as long you want.

15:35.476 --> 15:38.938
-You don't think this is long-term.
-I don't know. Maybe.

15:39.396 --> 15:41.148
Wow. Wow.

15:41.565 --> 15:44.860
If you believe that,
you're even crazier than I thought.

15:52.326 --> 15:54.995
-This is Hiram.
<i>Hi, Mr. Lodge?</i>

15:55.287 --> 15:57.081
<i>Yeah, this is Jughead Jones,</i>

15:57.706 --> 15:59.917
<i>I'm writing an article</i>
<i>about how General Pickens</i>

16:00.000 --> 16:03.003
<i>massacred the Uktena tribe</i>
<i>and stole the land you're building on.</i>

17:02.187 --> 17:04.398
I'm sorry he sold all your stuff.

17:21.081 --> 17:24.334

17:25.961 --> 17:28.464
Hey. What are you guys doing in here?

17:29.465 --> 17:31.925
We're just working
on some Pickens Day songs.

17:32.176 --> 17:33.385
Archie's agreed to help.

17:33.469 --> 17:35.345
Yeah, we can take it to the living room,

17:35.429 --> 17:36.638
-Mr. Lodge--
-No. No.

17:37.514 --> 17:38.390
Not at all.

17:38.932 --> 17:39.767
I have to say,

17:40.309 --> 17:44.897
the thought of you two being
in here alone used to upset me deeply.

17:45.439 --> 17:49.193
After seeing your performance today,
Archie, for some reason I'm less worried.

17:49.276 --> 17:52.029
-Daddy, be nice.
-Not everyone can wrestle.

17:52.529 --> 17:54.948
-It takes a certain kind of man--

17:55.032 --> 17:59.495
My point is there's no shame,
Archie, in admitting defeat.

18:00.037 --> 18:04.374
And accepting the fact that you're more
suited to singing with the Pussycats.

18:04.458 --> 18:09.171
Daddy,
Archie may not be a star wrestler yet,

18:09.546 --> 18:12.841
but he's an incredible musician.

18:13.383 --> 18:16.470
And bonus for me,
incredibly sexy when he sings.

18:18.806 --> 18:19.640
Thanks, babe.

18:21.350 --> 18:22.434
Ah.

18:29.191 --> 18:31.902
Maybe I shouldn't be spreading myself
too thin these days.

18:33.195 --> 18:34.113
Honestly?

18:34.655 --> 18:37.533
Yeah, I should get home,
practice some moves Kevin showed me.

18:38.575 --> 18:41.411
But I'll see you at tryouts tomorrow,
I hope?

18:43.330 --> 18:44.164
Yeah.

18:50.963 --> 18:53.006
Do you know who used to sit there?

18:53.090 --> 18:55.634
-Dad.
-Our daughter, Polly.

18:56.260 --> 18:59.054
You sit in her chair,
you sleep in her bed.

18:59.555 --> 19:00.973
You're filling a void.

19:01.723 --> 19:04.518
That's the reason you're here.
The only reason.

19:05.936 --> 19:08.021
It's okay, it doesn't bother me.

19:09.648 --> 19:11.275
Everyone needs something.

19:12.442 --> 19:15.237
And I don't expect to stay here for free.

19:15.320 --> 19:16.530
I never have.

19:23.120 --> 19:25.455
We're focusing on fundamentals today.

19:26.248 --> 19:28.876
Starting with the fireman's carry.

19:28.959 --> 19:32.171
And since it was his signature move,
back in the day,

19:32.254 --> 19:34.965
I've asked Hiram Lodge here
to demonstrate.

19:35.340 --> 19:37.801
Ram, will you do us the honor?

19:39.678 --> 19:42.181
All right, then. I need a volunteer.

19:46.518 --> 19:47.519
Archie Andrews.

19:50.314 --> 19:51.148
Come on.

19:59.072 --> 20:00.699
Come at me. Come on.

20:08.749 --> 20:12.961
This is a simple but effective move
when your opponent gets cocky.

20:13.921 --> 20:16.757
Dominating your rival,
demoralizing him...

20:17.341 --> 20:19.801
is the key if you want to win.

20:21.595 --> 20:25.599
Get the message. I always win.

20:28.852 --> 20:31.271
<i>"General Pickens was a murderer,</i>

20:31.355 --> 20:35.025
and ripples from his gruesome acts
continue to be felt today.

20:35.108 --> 20:38.695
Descendants of the victims
are still being displaced.

20:38.779 --> 20:40.656
So, I challenge the Northside,

20:40.739 --> 20:43.742
instead of honoring men
like General Pickens and Hiram Lodge,

20:43.825 --> 20:45.452
hold them accountable.

20:45.535 --> 20:48.372
Reparations must be paid
to men like Thomas Topaz,

20:48.455 --> 20:52.542
who are too old and beaten down
to fight back for themselves"?

20:52.626 --> 20:55.629
This town is messed up,
and it needs to own up to its history.

20:55.712 --> 20:59.174
My grandfather
isn't some broken

20:59.258 --> 21:02.928
Or some prop for your insane vendetta
against the Northside.

21:03.011 --> 21:04.638
-No, of course not.
-Look.

21:05.138 --> 21:05.973
I get it.

21:07.140 --> 21:08.725
You hate the Northside.

21:09.935 --> 21:13.897
You hate that instead of inviting you
to a party, they asked you to work it.

21:14.439 --> 21:19.111
It triggers your rage about being born
on the wrong side of the tracks. But this?

21:21.822 --> 21:23.657
This wasn't your story to tell.

21:33.917 --> 21:37.587
I can't cancel Pickens Day,
but I don't want you performing at it.

21:37.671 --> 21:40.674
With the town riled up over this article?
What if there's a riot? No one's rioting, Mom,
and I promised Veronica.

21:43.844 --> 21:45.220
Okay, well, I'm sorry,

21:45.304 --> 21:49.141
you can tell her that the Pussycats
aren't hers to order around.

21:49.224 --> 21:51.601
Why is Veronica triggering you
all of a sudden?

21:52.144 --> 21:55.230
Baby,
let me tell you something about Veronica.

21:55.772 --> 21:58.483
And her parents.
And the way they do business.

21:59.401 --> 22:02.904
And the way they use their daughter
to do their business.

-It's just--

22:23.467 --> 22:25.969
I don't like being manipulated by a Lodge.

22:26.511 --> 22:29.473
What?
Josie, is your mom making you do this?

22:30.390 --> 22:31.308
My mom?

22:32.684 --> 22:35.937
Whatever she
and your parents have going on,

22:36.021 --> 22:39.191
that's between them.
She doesn't want me to be a part of it.

22:39.274 --> 22:41.777
My mom says she may have
to do what your parents want,

22:41.860 --> 22:44.654
-but I don't have to do what you want.
Josie...

23:01.171 --> 23:05.217
Cameras aren't here, Jackie O.
And what about Jughead's article?

23:05.759 --> 23:07.219
What about it, Cheryl?

23:07.302 --> 23:10.013
It says
that Great-great-great-grandpappy Blossom

23:10.097 --> 23:12.849
hired General Pickens
to steal land from the Uktena.

23:12.933 --> 23:17.604
Well, how do you think we got started
in the maple syrup business? Help me up.

23:22.234 --> 23:26.738
But then that means
our family is partly responsible

23:26.822 --> 23:30.117
for killing literally hundreds of people. For what

23:33.954 --> 23:35.539
It wasn't just trees.

23:35.622 --> 23:37.415
Dark, fertile earth.

23:37.499 --> 23:42.337
A mighty river. Back in those early days,
we had a hand in everything.

23:43.171 --> 23:46.049
Building the railroads,
operating the saloons.

23:46.883 --> 23:48.677
And, yes, even a brothel.

23:49.344 --> 23:51.388
The old ways die hard, it seems.

23:59.437 --> 24:03.233
You're definitely getting better.
-I appreciate the help, Kevin.

24:03.316 --> 24:06.111
-You're a legend.

24:06.444 --> 24:07.571
Why wrestling?

24:08.196 --> 24:10.824
Why now?
I mean, trying to impress Mr. Lodge?

24:13.118 --> 24:16.163
To be honest, it didn't start there.

24:18.540 --> 24:22.711
But now... yeah, it's like there's nothing
I can do to earn his respect.

24:24.087 --> 24:27.591
And the more he looks down on me,
the more I wanna show him that he's wrong.

24:30.385 --> 24:33.471
Yeah. It's personal now.

24:34.639 --> 24:37.475
<i>Why'd you buy me that laptop?</i>
-Oh, um...

24:38.268 --> 24:41.938
I didn't. It's just an old computer I had
from the <i>Register.</i>

24:42.022 --> 24:43.440
Why'd you come get me?

24:45.525 --> 24:46.693
You're my brother.

24:49.362 --> 24:51.364
And my mom was depressed--

24:51.448 --> 24:54.618
No. Sorry, everything is a transaction.

24:56.036 --> 25:00.290
No one, not even you, is that nice.
So, why do you care, Betty?

25:00.999 --> 25:04.294
What do you want?
And careful, I'll know if you're lying.

25:05.921 --> 25:08.798
To figure out why I am the way that I am.

25:09.341 --> 25:12.928
There's a darkness in me
that I don't understand.

25:13.762 --> 25:14.763
That scares me.

25:16.765 --> 25:20.727
And I thought that maybe,
if you had it, too, which I think you do,

25:20.810 --> 25:23.355
you'd be able to help me make sense of it.

25:24.522 --> 25:28.318
I know about the webcamming.
That's why I got you the computer.

25:28.860 --> 25:33.031
So, if you ever wanna talk about that,
or compare scars--

25:33.114 --> 25:34.824
No, thanks, I'll pass.

25:38.495 --> 25:40.789
<i>I told the doorman I was here</i>
<i>to see Veronica.</i>

25:40.872 --> 25:44.376
And I'll have speak to Andre about that.
What is it, Archie?

25:44.876 --> 25:48.630
Why don't you like me, Mr. Lodge?
Why

25:50.382 --> 25:51.800
You really asking that?

25:52.884 --> 25:56.054
-Yeah, I am, and no, I don't.

25:56.137 --> 25:59.808
Your father slept with another man's wife.

26:00.350 --> 26:03.937
And why shouldn't I assume
you have the same weak character?

26:04.688 --> 26:07.190
I'm not my dad, Mr. Lodge. I would never--

26:07.274 --> 26:08.692
Maybe that's true,

26:08.775 --> 26:13.321
but still, you're not good enough
for my daughter in any respect.

26:13.405 --> 26:16.283
You're not worthy.
You'll never be able to take care of her.

26:16.366 --> 26:17.951
I did while you were in prison.

26:18.034 --> 26:18.868
Excuse me?

26:21.121 --> 26:23.081
When she and Mrs. Lodge
moved to Riverdale,

26:23.164 --> 26:25.375
I was there for your daughter.
You couldn't be.

26:25.458 --> 26:26.960
You would say that to me?

26:27.877 --> 26:29.087
In my house?

26:29.462 --> 26:31.464
What the hell is going on in here?

26:31.548 --> 26:34.592
-Veronica, ahem...
-Hey, we were just...

26:34.676 --> 26:37.595
Having some juvenile
chest

26:37.679 --> 26:38.722
No. Not at all<i>.</i>

26:38.805 --> 26:42.892
I just asked Archie to come over
and plan some one-on-one training.

26:43.435 --> 26:47.022
Really? That why it looks like
you're about to kill each other?

27:06.333 --> 27:08.710
<i>Meet me outside in five minutes.</i>

27:10.754 --> 27:11.629
Mr. Lodge?

27:12.297 --> 27:13.256
What time is it?

27:36.029 --> 27:36.863
Thank you.

27:39.324 --> 27:41.409
You know why I love wrestling?

27:41.493 --> 27:44.621
Because when it's two men on the mat,
it doesn't matter who you are.

27:44.996 --> 27:47.874
Or where you come from.
Or how strong you are.

27:48.416 --> 27:51.169
It's about sheer will.
And knowing your opponent.

27:51.711 --> 27:54.714
Maybe even better than he knows himself.

27:56.966 --> 27:59.636
Which is why, Archie...

28:01.137 --> 28:02.597
you will never win.

28:04.724 --> 28:06.559
-Veronica...

28:07.519 --> 28:11.356
has a lot on her plate.
And I don't want her worrying about us.

28:11.898 --> 28:15.068
So, after this morning,
we can say that I helped you.

28:15.610 --> 28:18.738
And that we went for a jog
and we broke bread together.

28:18.822 --> 28:21.699
And I will tolerate you...

28:23.118 --> 28:27.205
-until this phase runs its course.

28:27.288 --> 28:29.707
You're not the first boy
to turn her head.

28:30.542 --> 28:35.338
You see, boyfriends,
they come and they go.

28:36.673 --> 28:37.632
But fathers...

28:41.469 --> 28:42.971
fathers are forever.

28:46.641 --> 28:49.602
You're not hungry, <i>mija?</i>
Is it Archie and your dad?

28:50.520 --> 28:52.021
No, it's Josie.

28:52.564 --> 28:56.276
We got into a fight
and she dropped out of Pickens Day.

28:56.359 --> 28:57.485
I see.

28:59.362 --> 29:01.281
This is Sierra's doing, I assume?

29:02.991 --> 29:03.825
That's it.

29:05.326 --> 29:08.538
-I'm taking care of this.
-No, Mom. It's like you said.

29:08.621 --> 29:11.541
Our family works differently
from other families.

29:12.625 --> 29:15.837
If Josie and Mayor McCoy
don't like how we do business,

29:15.920 --> 29:16.796
that's on them.

29:18.506 --> 29:19.924
But the show must go on.

29:21.968 --> 29:24.763
I was angry,
because the Southside is our home.

29:25.722 --> 29:30.310
I'm sick of watching it get dismantled,
piece by piece, in front of our eyes.

29:31.144 --> 29:33.897
They take our drive-in,
then take our school.

29:33.980 --> 29:37.484
-I thought you were apologizing.
-I am.

29:40.195 --> 29:43.072
I shouldn't have used your story
or what happened to the Uktena

29:43.198 --> 29:45.825
against the Northside.
I had no right...

29:51.748 --> 29:52.791
I had no right.

29:55.460 --> 29:56.544
I'm sorry.

29:59.297 --> 30:01.049
Whatever your reasons were...

30:02.634 --> 30:04.219
you opened an old wound.

30:06.596 --> 30:08.681
Now something has to be done to heal it.

30:10.016 --> 30:12.894
Do you have something in mind, Grandpa?

30:33.206 --> 30:34.332
What are you doing here?

30:35.375 --> 30:36.417
Daddy invited me.

30:36.501 --> 30:39.170
He said it was your last day of tryouts
and I should come.

30:40.338 --> 30:42.382
He says you guys had a good talk.

30:43.424 --> 30:46.219
Anyway, not that you need it,
but good luck.

30:46.302 --> 30:48.638
I'll be in the stands, cheering you on.

31:01.734 --> 31:06.281
Gather around, boys.
We're gonna change things up a bit.

31:06.364 --> 31:08.950
First up on the mat is Andrews,

31:09.492 --> 31:11.578
who is going up against Clayton.

31:13.830 --> 31:17.333
Wait, coach, isn't Chuck
in a higher weight class than me?

31:17.417 --> 31:20.128
Damn, Andrews.
You sound like my little sister.

31:20.378 --> 31:22.380
Come on, time for Thunderdome.

31:22.463 --> 31:24.924

32:45.046 --> 32:46.255
Whoo!

33:00.269 --> 33:03.731
Eat up. Can't have an empty stomach
for Pickens Day.

33:04.482 --> 33:07.276
Especially since
it's our first family outing.

33:07.986 --> 33:10.613
Actually, I'm, uh, staying behind.

33:11.155 --> 33:14.325
I have a few odd jobs
to catch up on around the house.

33:14.409 --> 33:16.327
Fine, Hal. I won't beg.

33:16.411 --> 33:17.245
Salad.

33:38.599 --> 33:40.643
Sierra. I'm so glad you made it.

33:41.352 --> 33:43.563
Josie,
sorry you aren't singing with us today.

33:43.646 --> 33:48.026
After that article came out,
I forbade her to, Hermione. I was worried.

33:48.109 --> 33:51.154
Can't be too careful
when it comes to our children.

33:57.869 --> 33:59.537
That was a surprise, Archie.

34:00.663 --> 34:02.206
Your victory over Clayton.

34:03.541 --> 34:04.459
Thank you, sir.

34:05.752 --> 34:07.795
Are we done, Mr. Lodge?

34:11.591 --> 34:14.552
Come by The Pembrooke tonight.
We should talk about some things.

34:15.011 --> 34:16.137
I'll be there, sir.

34:21.517 --> 34:23.394
Have you ever had
a maple snow cone?

34:23.478 --> 34:24.896
I have not. Is it delicious?

34:24.979 --> 34:25.980
Oh, Chic.

34:26.314 --> 34:28.608
Betty, I'm so happy.

34:29.859 --> 34:30.693
Mom, Mom, Mom.

34:30.777 --> 34:34.072
-Alice.
-I thought you said you weren't coming.

34:34.155 --> 34:36.699
Do you know what you've let
into our house?

34:36.783 --> 34:39.285
-Lower your voice.

34:39.368 --> 34:40.620
What are you talking about?

34:40.703 --> 34:42.705
I went on your computer, Chic.

34:42.789 --> 34:45.625
I saw what you're doing online
with your clients.

34:45.708 --> 34:49.962
Dad, stop.
Stop snooping, and stop harassing him.

34:50.046 --> 34:54.425
I don't wanna hear it from you.
You bring home this... stranger,

34:54.509 --> 34:58.721
-It's not Polly's room anymore, Hal.

34:59.263 --> 35:00.181
It's Chic's.

35:00.264 --> 35:02.308
He has to go, Alice,

35:02.391 --> 35:04.018
and you know damn well why.

35:04.393 --> 35:08.397
Hal, I swear,
I threw you out once, I'll do it again.

35:22.286 --> 35:24.163
Hello, Riverdale. Ahem.

35:24.247 --> 35:25.456
Happy Pickens Day.

35:25.540 --> 35:28.960
On behalf of Lodge Industries
and Andrews Construction,

35:29.043 --> 35:33.131
we are thrilled to kick things off
with a new twist on an old favorite.

35:33.214 --> 35:35.800

Toni?

36:55.046 --> 36:57.131
Jughead

36:57.548 --> 37:00.968
We're here representing the dead
and the silenced.

37:01.510 --> 37:03.179
Pickens Day is a lie.

37:04.805 --> 37:07.475
General Pickens slaughtered
the Uktena tribe,

37:07.725 --> 37:09.560
my grandfather's family,

37:10.102 --> 37:13.397
and this land,
the land that we're standing on,

37:13.481 --> 37:16.359
that will soon give way
to a new Southside,

37:16.442 --> 37:17.985
was stolen from them.

37:18.736 --> 37:20.821
And we can't bring them back.

37:20.905 --> 37:24.116
But we can and we must honor them.

37:25.034 --> 37:26.911
Hey, folks, hi. Uh...

37:26.994 --> 37:29.914
I think we can all be proud
to live in a Riverdale

37:30.623 --> 37:33.542
where young people stand up for justice.

37:34.335 --> 37:38.214
Where a young woman can defend the honor
and legacy of her grandfather.

37:38.297 --> 37:41.759
And where we can celebrate
the living legacy of the Uktena,

37:41.842 --> 37:45.513
who contribute to the rich tapestry
that is Riverdale,

37:45.596 --> 37:47.807
that is the Southside,

37:47.890 --> 37:49.725
and that will be SoDale.

37:49.809 --> 37:52.395
So, let's hear a round of applause
for that, am I right?

37:53.396 --> 37:55.690
That's right. What do you say, people?

38:05.533 --> 38:06.367
No.

38:20.464 --> 38:22.967
How about we get you a proper dessert,
Hal?

38:23.592 --> 38:25.761
It looks like you could use
some company and...

38:26.721 --> 38:28.514
I've got nowhere I need to be.

38:30.599 --> 38:31.559
<i>Can I come in?</i>

38:42.361 --> 38:43.195
Sure.

38:45.323 --> 38:47.616
Betty, I have a confession to make.

38:49.285 --> 38:53.456
The first night I was here,
I came into your room while you slept.

38:54.540 --> 38:57.084
-I kept waking up that night.

38:57.793 --> 39:01.922
Trying to understand, why would this girl
go back to that place for me?

39:04.592 --> 39:07.762
But I think maybe I understand now.

39:09.096 --> 39:10.181
You're alone here.

39:14.310 --> 39:16.103
We'll start with why I webcam.

39:18.064 --> 39:20.316
One of the reasons is to make money.

39:21.275 --> 39:24.653
The other reason is to escape.

39:26.697 --> 39:28.282
Pretend to be someone else.

39:30.576 --> 39:31.577
Yes, but...

39:33.329 --> 39:34.246
more than that.

39:37.291 --> 39:41.253
It's a way of getting away
from the darkness I feel inside me, too.

39:48.344 --> 39:50.179
Can you show me how to do that?

40:01.357 --> 40:04.318
<i>And so,</i>
<i>with the stroke of a few keys,</i> <i>the dark education</i>
<i>of Betty Cooper had begun.</i>

40:08.614 --> 40:10.241
<i>And also, perhaps,</i>

40:10.658 --> 40:13.452
<i>the criminal apprenticeship</i>
<i>of Archie Andrews.</i>

40:15.371 --> 40:19.083
Let's start with a blank slate, Archie.
Where do you see yourself in five years?

40:19.625 --> 40:23.212
College. Hopefully on some type
of athletic scholarship.

40:24.088 --> 40:25.214
To study music?

40:26.882 --> 40:28.843
No, that was the old me.

40:30.761 --> 40:34.265
Now I'm thinking more like... business.

40:37.309 --> 40:40.229
Maybe one day I can buy back
Andrews Construction from you.

40:42.898 --> 40:48.696
Archie, as long as you're dating Veronica,
I'm going to demand the best from you.

40:51.323 --> 40:53.325
And that requires learning from the best.

40:53.409 --> 40:56.162
Like to start your business tutelage
under my shepherding?

41:09.592 --> 41:10.801
Sorry about that.

41:14.305 --> 41:15.890
Like an internship?

41:20.227 --> 41:22.521
<i>That night, plans would be made,</i>

41:22.605 --> 41:24.607
<i>alliances would be formed,</i>

41:24.690 --> 41:28.319
<i>and a horrifying act of desecration</i>
<i>would be committed.</i>

41:28.819 --> 41:31.739
Must've happened late last night
or early this morning.

41:31.822 --> 41:36.952
Well, Hiram, Hermione, it's your show now.
How would you like this handled?

41:37.495 --> 41:40.456
Swiftly, and with extreme prejudice.

41:40.539 --> 41:43.125
We all know
who the most likely suspects are.

41:44.293 --> 41:48.172
I mean, you tell me.
Isn't it something the Serpents would do?

41:48.589 --> 41:52.218
<i>Ensuring that the town's</i>
<i>civil war would go from a possibility</i>
