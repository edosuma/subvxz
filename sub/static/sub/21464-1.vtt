<i>I want you to think
about the mail for a minute.</i>

00:14.181 --> 00:20.061
<i>Stop taking it for granted like some
complacent, sleepwalking sheep</i>

00:20.062 --> 00:21.313
<i>and really think about it.</i>

00:23.315 --> 00:26.736
<i>I promise you,
you will find the U.S. mail</i>

00:27.570 --> 00:30.156
<i>a worthy object
of your contemplation.</i>

00:35.661 --> 00:37.954
<i>A piece of paper
can cross a continent</i>

00:37.955 --> 00:39.707
<i>like we're passing notes in class.</i>

00:40.166 --> 00:43.002
<i>I can send you cookies from
the opposite side of the world,</i>

00:43.753 --> 00:46.005
<i>and all I have to do is
write your name on the box,</i>

00:46.756 --> 00:49.675
<i>put some stamps on it,
and drop it in.</i>

00:53.804 --> 00:56.473
<i>And, you see, it only works</i>

00:56.474 --> 00:58.850
<i>because every single person
along the chain</i>

00:58.851 --> 01:01.020
<i>acts like a mindless automaton.</i>

01:01.979 --> 01:05.524
<i>I write an address,
and they just...obey.</i>

01:07.109 --> 01:08.152
<i>No question.</i>

01:09.153 --> 01:11.238
<i>No deviation.</i>

01:12.448 --> 01:15.117
<i>No pause to contemplate eternity...</i>

01:15.993 --> 01:17.078
<i>or beauty...</i>

01:19.705 --> 01:20.956
<i>or death.</i>

01:22.333 --> 01:25.669
<i>Even you, for all your
protestations of free will,</i>

01:26.295 --> 01:28.254
<i>if a box comes
with your name on it,</i>

01:28.255 --> 01:31.341
<i>you can't even imagine doing
anything other...</i>

01:31.342 --> 01:32.510
<i>than obey.</i>

01:32.927 --> 01:34.386
- Morning.
- Hey.

01:35.429 --> 01:36.763
Here you go.

01:36.764 --> 01:38.224
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

01:40.184 --> 01:42.602
<i>Well, it's not your fault.</i>

01:42.603 --> 01:44.771
<i>Society made you this way.</i>

01:44.772 --> 01:46.064
Hey, Gil?

01:46.065 --> 01:47.941
<i>But you're a sheep,</i>

01:47.942 --> 01:50.986
<i>and you're living
in a world of sheep.</i>

01:51.695 --> 01:55.950
<i>And because you're all sheep,
because all you can do is obey,</i>

01:57.201 --> 02:02.248
<i>I can reach out and touch
anyone anywhere.</i>

02:04.625 --> 02:07.670
<i>I can reach out and touch you...</i>

02:09.713 --> 02:10.881
<i>right now.</i>

03:41.931 --> 03:43.057
You're trespassing.

03:43.724 --> 03:45.017
This is private property.

03:51.190 --> 03:52.191
Hey, Fitz.

03:53.859 --> 03:55.361
Come on.
Let's go inside.

04:07.164 --> 04:11.293
Congratulations,
you are now officially FBI profilers.

04:17.091 --> 04:21.053
As profilers, you're going to
encounter a lot of skepticism.

04:22.054 --> 04:23.973
A lot of agents, good agents,

04:24.723 --> 04:26.350
think us quacks.

04:27.226 --> 04:28.851
No.

04:28.852 --> 04:31.480
We're pioneers in the frontier
of law enforcement.

04:31.730 --> 04:33.565
We're scientists of the mind,

04:33.774 --> 04:38.028
and, in the very worst cases
the FBI deals with,

04:38.737 --> 04:42.908
we will be our nation's last hope.

04:43.450 --> 04:45.703
Welcome to
the Behavioral Analysis Unit.

04:49.164 --> 04:51.375
Supervisory Special Agent
Jessica McGinity.

04:52.293 --> 04:53.418
Wonderful work.

04:55.254 --> 04:56.255
Thank you.

04:57.298 --> 04:59.591
With commendation
for superior merit,

04:59.842 --> 05:02.511
Supervisory Special Agent
James Fitzgerald.

05:04.596 --> 05:06.431
Congratulations, Fitz.
Congratulations.

05:06.432 --> 05:07.558
Yeah!

05:07.975 --> 05:08.976
Go Dad!

05:09.768 --> 05:11.020
Dad. Whoo-hoo!

05:24.992 --> 05:27.618
Dad, come on!
Come outside, Dad!

05:27.619 --> 05:29.412
- Come on, Dad. Come on.
- Come on, Dad.

05:29.413 --> 05:32.249
- Mom's gonna give us a speech.
- Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I'm coming.

05:32.499 --> 05:34.001
- Come on!
- I'm coming!

05:39.965 --> 05:41.258
Okay. Hi, everybody.

05:44.553 --> 05:46.263
Can you believe we're even here

05:46.638 --> 05:51.018
celebrating my husband
the FBI profiler?

05:52.644 --> 05:53.936
I'm still pinching myself.

05:56.732 --> 05:59.360
You were a rookie beat cop
when we got married.

06:02.446 --> 06:06.574
Jim, you were determined always

06:06.575 --> 06:08.034
to become what you saw

06:08.035 --> 06:10.913
as the best version of yourself,

06:11.955 --> 06:14.248
to become someone

06:14.249 --> 06:19.046
that your family, your sons
could look up to and admire.

06:21.298 --> 06:23.801
It's not easy being married
to a stubborn man.

06:26.345 --> 06:28.513
I'm talking about you.

06:28.514 --> 06:30.556
But it's that damned stubbornness

06:30.557 --> 06:34.060
that got you through night school,
onto the detective squad,

06:34.061 --> 06:37.481
into Quantico, and finally
into the elite of the elite.

06:39.858 --> 06:42.569
I admire that so, so much.

06:43.278 --> 06:45.781
So cheers, Jim.
Welcome home.

06:53.539 --> 06:54.748
Did you have fun?

06:55.416 --> 06:57.750
Yeah. You know
I'm not great in crowds.

06:57.751 --> 06:59.794
Well, I tried.

06:59.795 --> 07:02.548
All right, look, who cares?
Dan, clean up down there!

07:02.756 --> 07:04.757
Listen, it was amazing.

07:04.758 --> 07:06.510
- Thank you.
- Aww.

07:07.177 --> 07:08.594
Look, I tried.

07:08.595 --> 07:10.681
Thank you.

07:11.056 --> 07:13.099
Well, you know, I-I...

07:14.852 --> 07:15.810
What?

07:15.811 --> 07:16.894
I had fun.

07:16.895 --> 07:18.897
It's just hard waiting.

07:20.357 --> 07:22.775
- Oh, yeah.
- You know?

07:22.776 --> 07:24.736
No, I-I got soapy hands.

07:25.446 --> 07:27.614
Put 'em on me.

07:29.199 --> 07:30.993
Dad, there's two bald guys
at the door!

07:31.452 --> 07:32.743
Oh! Put 'em up!

07:32.744 --> 07:33.786
Dan, Dan!

07:33.787 --> 07:36.080
- Look at this kid.
- Hey.

07:36.081 --> 07:37.457
- Hey.
- Hey.

07:37.458 --> 07:39.000
- Guess we missed the party.
- Look who it is.

07:39.001 --> 07:40.251
No, no, we're just--
We're just cleaning up.

07:40.252 --> 07:42.170
- Dan.
- We're trying. It's a zoo.

07:42.171 --> 07:44.088
- Ugh, you got to change him.
- Apologies.

07:44.089 --> 07:45.466
- Yeah, all right.
- There you go.

07:46.258 --> 07:49.427
- Apologies, but...
- It's all right.

07:49.428 --> 07:51.388
We have something urgent
we need to discuss with you.

07:54.308 --> 07:55.267
Right.

07:56.935 --> 07:58.562
Yeah, come in.

08:00.939 --> 08:03.733
McAlpine says you're
the best profiler in his class.

08:03.734 --> 08:04.943
Maybe the best he's got.

08:05.444 --> 08:08.237
But you're 10 years older
than the rest of your classmates,

08:08.238 --> 08:10.031
and I look at your résumé,

08:10.032 --> 08:13.410
and I see you languishing for
almost a decade as a beat cop,

08:13.577 --> 08:15.412
mostly on the graffiti squad.

08:16.246 --> 08:17.915
You piss somebody off?
What happened?

08:20.167 --> 08:21.334
No.

08:21.335 --> 08:23.504
I wrote a parking ticket.

08:23.754 --> 08:26.005
Mm. Chief asked me
to make it go away

08:26.006 --> 08:27.465
'cause it was for a friend
of a friend, and I didn't.

08:27.466 --> 08:30.010
So, what, you're like
the Serpico of parking tickets?

08:30.594 --> 08:32.803
Some people would call that
being overly literal.

08:32.804 --> 08:34.139
Yeah, some people might.

08:36.266 --> 08:37.267
Take a look at this letter.

08:37.684 --> 08:38.894
Tell me what you see.

08:47.402 --> 08:49.071
You're making fun of me?

08:49.488 --> 08:50.655
You're making fun of me, right?

08:50.656 --> 08:53.324
Right?
Here, take these upstairs.

08:53.325 --> 08:54.575
How many times
do I have to tell you?

08:54.576 --> 08:55.702
You talking about the emordnilap?

08:56.119 --> 08:57.162
"Dad, it is I"?

08:57.371 --> 08:58.497
Explain.

09:00.541 --> 09:02.626
Well, it's a word thing.

09:02.876 --> 09:05.294
It's like a palindrome, except
it spells one thing forwards

09:05.295 --> 09:06.213
and another thing backwards.

09:06.797 --> 09:09.757
The first letter
of each paragraph--D, A, D,

09:09.758 --> 09:13.262
I, T, I, S, I.

09:15.389 --> 09:16.348
Okay.

09:17.266 --> 09:21.727
D, A, D, I, T, I, S, I--
"Dad, it is I."

09:21.728 --> 09:23.438
D-A-D, I-T, right?

09:26.233 --> 09:31.279
D-A-D, I-T, I-S, I--

09:31.280 --> 09:35.033
"Dad, it is I,"
"Is it I, Dad?"

09:35.909 --> 09:37.077
It's pretty cool, right?

09:37.661 --> 09:40.205
I'm Andy Genelli.
I'm head of the UNABOM Task Force.

09:43.750 --> 09:44.793
I thought the--

09:45.460 --> 09:46.962
I thought the Unabom case
was over.

09:48.422 --> 09:49.839
Six years and not a peep.

09:49.840 --> 09:52.551
They thought he was dead,
but now he's back.

09:54.177 --> 09:57.222
Three new mail bombs,
more deadly than before.

09:57.806 --> 10:01.977
The latest one yesterday--
a timber lobbyist, Sacramento.

10:02.311 --> 10:04.521
The news is gonna break
on these tomorrow.

10:04.980 --> 10:06.689
We've been playing it
pretty close to the vest

10:06.690 --> 10:08.107
until we were sure it was him,
and not a...

10:08.108 --> 10:11.569
- Hey. Okay.
- Copycat, but it's him,

10:11.570 --> 10:13.487
and we need a profile.

10:13.488 --> 10:15.406
Okay.
Go on upstairs. Now.

10:15.407 --> 10:17.492
Now, what do you want from me?

10:17.659 --> 10:18.660
- I have kids.
- I want to send you.

10:21.038 --> 10:22.538
It's one month.

10:22.539 --> 10:24.790
You go out there,
build a profile,

10:24.791 --> 10:27.836
and come back to the B.A.U.
with a big gold star.

10:33.842 --> 10:35.844
This here--This is from him,
from the Unabomber?

10:36.219 --> 10:37.471
His most recent letter.

10:38.055 --> 10:41.057
50 FBI agents have been going over that
with a fine-tooth comb

10:41.058 --> 10:42.975
day and night for two weeks.

10:42.976 --> 10:46.021
Not one of them saw
the emordnilap, not even me.

10:46.480 --> 10:49.190
I've had profilers working
on this thing for 15 years,

10:49.191 --> 10:51.442
and we're right back
to where we started.

10:51.443 --> 10:53.444
I need somebody
that sees things differently,

10:53.445 --> 10:54.821
and like it or not, that's you.

10:59.493 --> 11:02.537
But I've been away for four months,
and I just got back.

11:02.704 --> 11:04.372
I can't just up and go
'cause of him,

11:04.373 --> 11:05.999
so...

11:06.416 --> 11:07.708
I can't do that to Ellie
and the kids.

11:07.709 --> 11:09.251
I can't do that to my family.

11:09.252 --> 11:10.629
Here. Good luck.

11:12.005 --> 11:13.297
Good night.
Sorry to intrude, Mrs. Fitzgerald.

11:13.298 --> 11:14.965
- Do me a favor, Fitz.
- Hmm?

11:14.966 --> 11:17.176
Fitz, think about it.

11:17.177 --> 11:18.886
Keep the photos.

11:18.887 --> 11:21.223
The guy with his face blown off,

11:22.015 --> 11:23.517
he had a wife and kids, too.

11:25.977 --> 11:28.105
- See ya.
- Not if I see you first.

11:29.189 --> 11:30.649
Thank you.

11:40.659 --> 11:42.076
Are those cookies
from Grandma?

11:42.077 --> 11:43.120
Those are
my cookies from Grandma.

11:44.246 --> 11:45.455
- They're mine.
- Yeah. Go and unpack.

11:48.500 --> 11:49.960
Go, go.

11:52.421 --> 11:53.879
- Hi, guys.
- These are mine.

11:53.880 --> 11:55.631
You need to share!
You're always so--

11:55.632 --> 11:57.466
I'm definitely not sharing.

11:57.467 --> 11:59.678
Sorry, buddy, 'cause Grandma
made these cookies just for me.

12:00.178 --> 12:01.804
Yeah, but you need to share.

12:01.805 --> 12:03.348
No, I'm not gonna share...

12:12.607 --> 12:13.607
These are my cookies.

12:13.608 --> 12:14.525
Hey, guys.

12:14.526 --> 12:16.361
Don't pig out
on Grandma's cookies.

12:19.614 --> 12:21.992
Not for you.
You can't have any.

12:57.694 --> 13:00.489
Look at you.
You're living like an animal now, huh?

13:03.074 --> 13:04.366
Jesus.

13:04.367 --> 13:06.076
You kill those yourself?

13:06.077 --> 13:07.621
What are you doing
in my house, Cole?

13:08.038 --> 13:11.374
Well, I don't want to be here,
believe me.

13:12.167 --> 13:14.251
But the boss needs you.

13:14.252 --> 13:16.378
We need you to get into a room
with Kaczynski,

13:16.379 --> 13:19.507
interrogate him,
break him down,

13:19.508 --> 13:20.592
get him to plead guilty.

13:21.176 --> 13:23.678
We need someone who can speak
the Unabomber's language,

13:24.679 --> 13:28.308
someone, uh,
that he connects with.

13:31.269 --> 13:32.562
Besides...

13:34.481 --> 13:35.482
Ted asked for you.

13:44.533 --> 13:46.618
The Unabomber
asked for me specifically?

13:48.495 --> 13:51.706
Specifically for you,
and only you.

13:51.915 --> 13:52.874
Why me?

13:53.917 --> 13:56.627
He says he'll only talk to the person
who actually caught him,

13:56.628 --> 13:58.128
and for some reason,
he thinks that's you.

13:58.129 --> 14:00.840
Well, that is me. You were chasing
your tails for years before I came.

14:00.841 --> 14:03.009
This guy--You got some nerve.

14:03.593 --> 14:06.595
I found him, I caught him,
I put him in jail.

14:06.596 --> 14:08.264
You know what?
I got my life back together.

14:08.265 --> 14:10.474
I'm just gonna stay right here.
Tell Ted I'm busy.

14:10.475 --> 14:12.351
Listen, we have enough
evidence to convict

14:12.352 --> 14:14.187
Ted Kaczynski 10 times over,

14:15.230 --> 14:16.647
but if this goes to trial,

14:16.648 --> 14:18.774
he's gonna make it a media circus.

14:18.775 --> 14:21.193
Then we would be giving
the Unabomber, Ted Kaczynski,

14:21.194 --> 14:23.029
the biggest microphone in America,

14:23.822 --> 14:25.490
and his message is dangerous.

14:26.950 --> 14:28.742
We need him to plead guilty.

14:28.743 --> 14:30.035
Look, Fitz, we're asking you,

14:30.036 --> 14:31.203
but we can order you
if we need to.

14:31.204 --> 14:32.746
- You can order me.
- Right.

14:32.747 --> 14:34.039
You still work for the FBI,
you remember that?

14:34.040 --> 14:36.208
- Now, hold on, Cole.
- I get the Forestry Service out here--

14:36.209 --> 14:38.294
- Take it down, Cole!
- Get out of here.

14:38.295 --> 14:39.254
Get out of here.

14:41.506 --> 14:43.049
Hey, Fitz.

14:45.760 --> 14:47.137
Think about it.

15:58.708 --> 16:00.834
<i>Ground transportation and taxis</i>

16:00.835 --> 16:03.421
<i>are located at the end
of Concourse One...</i>

16:05.006 --> 16:05.840
Fitz!

16:13.223 --> 16:14.975
You have that new-profiler smell.

16:15.558 --> 16:16.725
Tabby Milgrim.

16:16.726 --> 16:17.810
- Hi.
- I'm your new partner.

16:17.811 --> 16:19.980
Well, I'm the UTF's
whole Behavioral Unit.

16:20.313 --> 16:22.065
Come on. Let's get you
out of this craziness.

16:23.108 --> 16:25.110
PB today. Sorry.

16:25.819 --> 16:28.195
Night school in psych sucks, but...

16:28.196 --> 16:31.323
Plus, U San Rafael
is about a fart and a half away

16:31.324 --> 16:33.534
from losing its accreditation,
but whatever.

16:33.535 --> 16:35.703
As long as I squeak out
a master's before they go under,

16:35.704 --> 16:36.704
we're all good.

16:36.705 --> 16:37.871
So, you're a profiler.

16:37.872 --> 16:38.998
You trained at the B.A.U.?

16:38.999 --> 16:40.499
Hell no, bruh.

16:40.500 --> 16:42.085
I'm just a street agent.

16:51.720 --> 16:53.679
You ever worked
on a big op before?

16:53.680 --> 16:54.847
Some big bank robberies,

16:54.848 --> 16:58.392
and a D.A. homicide task force in Philly
had, like, 20 full-time agents.

16:58.393 --> 16:59.893
It was pretty huge,
pretty intense.

16:59.894 --> 17:03.398
Hmm. Well, welcome to
the UNABOM Task Force.

17:04.774 --> 17:06.276
Whoa.

17:21.666 --> 17:24.001
Fresh meat, you're with me.

17:24.002 --> 17:25.335
Big bad Stan Cole.

17:25.336 --> 17:26.963
Come on.
Briefing's about to start.

17:29.799 --> 17:30.633
All right.

17:31.634 --> 17:33.428
I'm gonna rip the Band-Aid off quick.

17:34.137 --> 17:36.680
Most of you are TDY'd here for 60 days--

17:36.681 --> 17:38.974
I want to get you on the playing field,

17:38.975 --> 17:41.560
except, of course, for Tabby
who's been here for two years

17:41.561 --> 17:43.562
and somehow still shows up late.

17:43.563 --> 17:47.775
We are hunting the deadliest
serial bomber in history--

17:47.776 --> 17:49.735
the Unabomber.

17:49.736 --> 17:52.697
For 17 years, he's been
planting and mailing bombs,

17:53.239 --> 17:56.450
16 bombs, three people killed,
dozens injured,

17:56.451 --> 17:59.328
and we really have
no friggin' clue who he is

17:59.329 --> 18:00.829
or why he's doing this.

18:00.830 --> 18:03.207
We call him the Unabomber
because his early targets

18:03.208 --> 18:05.000
were universities and airlines--

18:05.001 --> 18:09.172
"UN" for university,
"A" for airline, UNABOM.

18:09.839 --> 18:12.217
He calls himself "FC"
for "Freedom Club."

18:12.425 --> 18:14.135
It's how he signs all his letters.

18:14.719 --> 18:16.346
It's also how he signs his bombs.

18:16.930 --> 18:20.682
17 years of bombs
all signed by FC.

18:20.683 --> 18:22.142
He's a sick bastard.

18:22.143 --> 18:23.936
Northwestern, 1978,

18:23.937 --> 18:25.772
another one there in '79.

18:26.523 --> 18:30.568
Nearly takes out
American Airlines Flight 444.

18:31.152 --> 18:34.446
The bomb was sent via air mail
rigged with an altimeter--

18:34.447 --> 18:35.990
22 passengers injured.

18:36.491 --> 18:40.744
1980, United Airlines president
gets his face blown in.

18:40.745 --> 18:43.872
More university bombs, '81, '82--

18:43.873 --> 18:46.960
computer science professors,
engineering professors,

18:47.293 --> 18:49.294
one poor secretary at Vanderbilt

18:49.295 --> 18:52.256
opened a package
addressed to her boss.

18:52.257 --> 18:56.636
More universities in '82, '85, '85,

18:57.095 --> 18:58.762
Boeing in '85,

18:58.763 --> 19:01.432
two computer shops,
'85 and '87.

19:02.058 --> 19:04.185
The second one,
he got his first fatality.

19:05.937 --> 19:09.524
And this is where we got
our first eyewitness.

19:10.400 --> 19:13.068
She gave us this now-famous sketch,

19:13.069 --> 19:15.864
and then nothing for six years.

19:16.114 --> 19:19.659
So we figured he was dead
or maybe finally got laid.

19:21.578 --> 19:23.162
But then he is back--

19:23.163 --> 19:25.914
Epstein at U.C.,
Gelernter at Yale.

19:25.915 --> 19:28.792
In his hiatus, he developed
much more powerful

19:28.793 --> 19:31.295
and sophisticated bombs,
and they keep coming.

19:31.296 --> 19:33.839
Exxon Valdez's PR guy, Mosser,

19:33.840 --> 19:37.050
and just last week,
Gil Murray in Sacramento.

19:37.051 --> 19:39.470
It took three body bags
to collect the parts.

19:42.223 --> 19:44.642
Why these targets?
Why now?

19:45.393 --> 19:46.310
No clue.

19:46.311 --> 19:47.562
So, what forensic leads
do we have?

19:48.438 --> 19:50.523
Basically,
we have no forensic leads.

19:51.733 --> 19:53.443
No DNA, no prints.

19:53.860 --> 19:55.611
But we did have
a couple good ideas.

19:55.612 --> 19:57.654
We discovered
that he gets his addresses

19:57.655 --> 19:59.616
out of one particular edition
of <i>Who's Who,</i>

20:00.617 --> 20:03.953
so we interviewed just about every
librarian in the country--nothing.

20:05.079 --> 20:06.705
Makes his bombs out of junk,

20:06.706 --> 20:09.876
so we did a national
junkyard canvass--no dice.

20:10.710 --> 20:12.961
But we figure eventually
he is gonna screw up,

20:12.962 --> 20:14.005
and maybe he already did.

20:14.422 --> 20:17.132
Over the years, he's been
mailing typed letters.

20:17.133 --> 20:19.219
Nothing worth reading until this:

20:19.636 --> 20:21.970
letter that he wrote
to <i>The New York Times.</i>

20:21.971 --> 20:24.097
Now, the letter itself
is blah-blah-blah,

20:24.098 --> 20:26.683
but forensics found this
on the envelope--

20:26.684 --> 20:28.352
"Call Nathan R."

20:28.353 --> 20:30.312
We figure he wrote himself
a Post-it note

20:30.313 --> 20:31.563
on top of the letter.

20:31.564 --> 20:34.025
And that is our first real lead.

20:34.275 --> 20:36.610
FBI agents are interviewing
everyone called

20:36.611 --> 20:38.695
"Nathan R-something"
in the country.

20:38.696 --> 20:42.033
Plan B is to find Nathans
with "R" middle names.

20:42.325 --> 20:44.117
10,000 Nathan Rs.

20:44.118 --> 20:47.247
And that is it.
Enjoy your afternoons.

20:48.414 --> 20:50.124
Don't forget to tip your driver.

20:52.126 --> 20:53.336
It's not much to go on.

20:54.087 --> 20:55.462
Nope.

20:55.463 --> 20:56.964
This is why they need us.

20:56.965 --> 20:59.008
The profile is gonna focus
the entire search.

21:00.343 --> 21:01.761
It's a big responsibility.

21:02.428 --> 21:04.222
It's exciting.
Yeah, right?

21:05.098 --> 21:06.932
Mildly.
Come on.

21:06.933 --> 21:08.810
S.A.C. Ackerman
wants to meet you.

21:10.436 --> 21:11.478
It's an honor, sir.

21:11.479 --> 21:13.063
I feel privileged
to be under your command.

21:13.064 --> 21:14.856
I studied your cases
at the Academy--

21:14.857 --> 21:17.192
the Russian River killer,
Hartford abduction.

21:17.193 --> 21:19.695
Under any other agent,
that would've ended in a murder-suicide,

21:19.696 --> 21:21.154
and, Agent Cole,

21:21.155 --> 21:23.866
Ohio Seven sting,
busting the Bad Axe Militia.

21:24.784 --> 21:26.411
I can't believe
I'm standing here.

21:27.161 --> 21:28.997
I am--I'm eager
to learn from you both.

21:29.289 --> 21:31.581
Well, I love this guy already.

21:31.582 --> 21:34.835
So, Fitz, we sent Genelli to bring back
the best man he could find,

21:34.836 --> 21:36.045
and that is you.

21:36.754 --> 21:38.255
Welcome aboard.

21:38.256 --> 21:41.426
And here is what you're
gonna be working on.

21:43.636 --> 21:46.388
Low I.Q., formerly
employed by an airline.

21:46.389 --> 21:49.099
Mechanic or technician,
no higher education,

21:49.100 --> 21:50.935
possibly little to no high school,

21:51.477 --> 21:54.397
grew up in Ohio--
Cleveland or Cincinnati likely--

21:54.772 --> 21:56.524
currently resides
in the Bay Area.

21:57.817 --> 21:59.151
So, what is this?

21:59.152 --> 22:02.071
It's our current profile,
my own summary of it.

22:03.573 --> 22:04.532
Where's the rest of it?

22:04.699 --> 22:06.408
That's exactly why you're here.

22:06.409 --> 22:09.244
I want you to take that,
flesh it out.

22:09.245 --> 22:10.746
I'm gonna need 15 pages

22:10.747 --> 22:13.499
that can go directly on Attorney General
Janet Reno's desk.

22:14.083 --> 22:15.835
So make us look good.

22:17.920 --> 22:20.547
Yeah, I will. I will.
I'll do my best.

22:20.548 --> 22:22.424
It's just a little different
than I'm used to,

22:22.425 --> 22:24.468
'cause in terms of a profile,
they were a lot more scientific

22:24.469 --> 22:26.178
and a little bit longer.

22:26.179 --> 22:27.763
Welcome to the real world.

22:27.764 --> 22:29.390
Quantico's a long way away.

22:30.558 --> 22:32.934
What S.S.A. Cole
means is that that summary

22:32.935 --> 22:34.979
is a distillation of 10 years' work,

22:35.438 --> 22:39.400
so it's got a solid foundation,
and we don't expect it to change,

22:39.984 --> 22:40.985
except for the wood thing.

22:41.277 --> 22:43.488
- Mm.
- The wood thing?

22:43.988 --> 22:46.656
There's a theory
FC is obsessed with wood.

22:46.657 --> 22:49.659
Maybe he has erectile dysfunction.

22:49.660 --> 22:52.120
Since he blew up
this Mosser guy--moss--

22:52.121 --> 22:55.500
It's like a plant, so that
can go in your profile now.

22:55.917 --> 22:58.460
That's gonna play
very, very well with the press,

22:58.461 --> 23:00.712
so I want you to
dress that up a bit,

23:00.713 --> 23:04.591
uh, "a propensity for softness
in the genital region,"

23:04.592 --> 23:06.094
something like that--
but nothing crude.

23:08.805 --> 23:10.807
I can definitely do something.

23:12.308 --> 23:13.892
I was expecting a support team.

23:13.893 --> 23:15.728
Nope.
It's all you, Fitz.

23:16.104 --> 23:17.313
But I know you can handle it.

23:18.147 --> 23:18.981
Okay.

23:20.066 --> 23:23.151
15 pages, clean,
no typos, and wood,

23:23.152 --> 23:25.154
a lot of bullet points,
a lot of big words,

23:26.322 --> 23:28.532
a couple weeks,
get it turned in,

23:28.533 --> 23:30.326
get you back home.

23:31.077 --> 23:33.245
If you want to hear some war stories,

23:33.246 --> 23:34.830
come out for a beer tomorrow.

23:34.831 --> 23:37.332
We're going to Freddy's--
old-school San Francisco.

23:37.333 --> 23:38.333
You'll like it.

23:38.334 --> 23:39.419
- Sure.
- Yeah.

24:17.915 --> 24:19.499
I just don't see it.

24:19.500 --> 24:20.668
I just don't see the wood thing.

24:23.254 --> 24:26.090
They want me to do a thing
about FC's erectile dysfunction.

24:27.758 --> 24:29.509
What is it with men
and their dongs?

24:29.510 --> 24:30.677
You should write it.

24:30.678 --> 24:32.721
Write that report--
You'll be on CNN tonight.

24:32.722 --> 24:33.723
Yeah.

24:34.307 --> 24:35.433
It's B.S.

24:37.935 --> 24:40.271
This profile--
This profile is B.S.

24:42.773 --> 24:43.691
I think it's got to go.

24:44.233 --> 24:45.318
Let's just start over.

24:45.693 --> 24:47.903
What, just toss it all?

24:47.904 --> 24:49.155
I don't know, man.

24:49.447 --> 24:51.990
They've been saying "airlines,
mechanic from Cincinnati"

24:51.991 --> 24:54.243
for years now--
consistently.

24:54.785 --> 24:56.037
There must be some reason.

24:56.996 --> 24:57.955
Come here.

24:59.123 --> 25:01.250
What's the first trap
we watch for as profilers?

25:02.126 --> 25:03.793
Inherited assumptions.

25:03.794 --> 25:06.838
So all these preconceptions
we just toss out,

25:06.839 --> 25:07.673
come at it clean.

25:08.216 --> 25:11.635
We know nothing about FC
except what the evidence tells us,

25:11.636 --> 25:14.179
so if we don't assume
that he's an airline worker,

25:14.180 --> 25:15.598
what else points to Cincinnati?

25:16.057 --> 25:18.183
All the bombs that he planted
at the universities,

25:18.184 --> 25:20.185
was it because he's
a resentful outsider

25:20.186 --> 25:21.728
or 'cause that's where
he felt most safe?

25:21.729 --> 25:23.856
And here--All right?
Okay.

25:24.273 --> 25:27.192
When he talked down on people
with advanced degrees,

25:27.193 --> 25:29.778
is he actually low I.Q.
with no higher education,

25:29.779 --> 25:31.571
or is he really smart,
maybe has a bunch of degrees

25:31.572 --> 25:33.448
and knows we're gonna read this letter

25:33.449 --> 25:34.825
and is hoping that we don't think
too hard about it?

25:36.994 --> 25:39.539
I...wow.

25:41.040 --> 25:42.583
Yeah.

25:43.668 --> 25:44.502
I don't know.

25:45.753 --> 25:47.003
Exactly.

25:47.004 --> 25:48.548
We don't know.

25:49.507 --> 25:50.967
We don't know anything.

25:52.635 --> 25:54.010
But you go by this profile,

25:54.011 --> 25:56.847
your mind is just gonna go like this.

25:59.016 --> 26:00.308
So we start over.

26:00.309 --> 26:01.644
Make a list, everything we need.

26:03.563 --> 26:05.481
Yes!

26:05.731 --> 26:07.816
Respectfully, this is
what I need to start over

26:07.817 --> 26:09.526
and build a profile
we can all stand behind.

26:09.527 --> 26:11.653
I know it's a bump
in time and in resources,

26:11.654 --> 26:13.655
but this is going on
the attorney general's desk,

26:13.656 --> 26:15.282
it's going in the press
with your name on it,

26:15.283 --> 26:17.243
so we have to get it right.

26:18.035 --> 26:20.203
How many profiles
have you created,

26:20.204 --> 26:22.080
outside the classroom,
I mean?

26:22.081 --> 26:23.999
This is my first.

26:24.000 --> 26:25.333
Well, there you go.

26:25.334 --> 26:26.961
So let me explain
to you how this works.

26:27.712 --> 26:31.047
Your job is to fulfill the duties
laid out to you by S.A.C.

26:31.048 --> 26:32.465
That's Ackerman.

26:32.466 --> 26:35.261
He gave you parameters,
now go execute.

26:35.678 --> 26:37.721
Respectfully, all I'm asking for

26:37.722 --> 26:39.764
is the freedom to do excellent
work for you. That's all.

26:39.765 --> 26:41.850
Otherwise, your profile is gonna
hamper your investigation.

26:41.851 --> 26:42.934
It's not gonna help it.

26:42.935 --> 26:45.645
When your only tool's
a hammer, son,

26:45.646 --> 26:47.148
everything looks like a nail.

26:47.440 --> 26:50.234
You're a profiler, you think
the profile's gonna catch him.

26:50.776 --> 26:52.444
Genelli's a gearhead.

26:52.445 --> 26:54.237
He thinks it's all about his computer.

26:54.238 --> 26:57.115
We got a guy that's been working
on the Unabomber stamp selection

26:57.116 --> 26:58.492
for the last five years.

26:59.160 --> 27:03.623
To him, a $1.00 Eugene O'Neill stamp
is the key to everything.

27:04.999 --> 27:07.917
Now, I inherited that guy
and I allow him to pursue that avenue,

27:07.918 --> 27:09.837
'cause, uh, well,
you never know.

27:11.213 --> 27:12.632
But when I tell him
to do something,

27:14.342 --> 27:15.343
I expect him to do it.

27:18.095 --> 27:20.139
Well, I'm not your stamp guy.
I'm your profiler.

27:20.431 --> 27:22.850
Even the stamp guy doesn't
think he's the stamp guy.

27:33.110 --> 27:34.654
All right,
let me walk you through it.

27:36.113 --> 27:37.114
You know what these are?

27:38.199 --> 27:40.408
These are profiles
of the Unabomber,

27:40.409 --> 27:41.743
and we've got them all.

27:41.744 --> 27:43.871
You want to know where he lives?
Okay.

27:45.498 --> 27:49.085
In a house with a room that his wife
and kids know never to go into.

27:51.170 --> 27:53.506
Or maybe with his mother--

27:54.507 --> 27:55.633
a Norman Bates thing going on.

27:58.511 --> 27:59.887
And this is a classic.

28:00.638 --> 28:03.640
It's 20 full pages by
the legendary John Douglas

28:03.641 --> 28:05.768
about how the Unabomber
maintains his car

28:06.185 --> 28:09.397
right down to the air freshener,
which is Royal Pine.

28:10.856 --> 28:13.441
Now, we've had every top profiler
in the business come through here,

28:13.442 --> 28:15.944
and every single one of them says
he's got to start all over,

28:15.945 --> 28:18.822
and every one of them says
something completely different,

28:18.823 --> 28:21.575
so pardon me if I'm a little skeptical
of your profession.

28:22.910 --> 28:24.953
Now, Ackerman brought me in here

28:24.954 --> 28:27.706
to keep this investigation
focused and on track.

28:27.707 --> 28:29.666
We've been running around
in circles for years,

28:29.667 --> 28:30.876
and it's time for that to stop.

28:31.794 --> 28:34.338
So instead of a hundred
different contradictory profiles,

28:34.505 --> 28:38.676
we're going with one, backed up
by concrete forensic evidence,

28:39.427 --> 28:41.011
and that's the profile
that I gave you.

28:41.470 --> 28:43.555
The only way we're
gonna catch the Unabomber,

28:43.556 --> 28:46.224
same way we catch anybody,
that's forensics.

28:46.225 --> 28:47.226
It's plain and simple.

28:48.227 --> 28:49.561
Now, you could spend six months

28:49.562 --> 28:52.522
coming up with the world's
most accurate profile,

28:52.523 --> 28:54.149
but that's not what
we're looking for.

28:54.150 --> 28:57.193
We're looking for 15 pages,
no typos, and wood,

28:57.194 --> 28:58.863
and we want to take it
to the press next week.

28:59.155 --> 29:01.197
Now, I understand
that you're a brilliant guy.

29:01.198 --> 29:02.199
I do.

29:02.491 --> 29:05.410
McAlpine says you can all kinds
of stuff hidden in letters,

29:05.411 --> 29:07.579
and that's great,
so take the Unabom letters

29:07.580 --> 29:08.706
and find wood.

29:09.457 --> 29:10.291
Okay?

29:11.375 --> 29:16.130
So, right now, all that's
required of you is obedience.

29:18.215 --> 29:19.049
Understand?

29:27.933 --> 29:31.019
Okay, on Tuesday,
we discuss regional dialects

29:31.020 --> 29:32.521
and linguistic prescriptivism.

29:33.189 --> 29:34.023
See you next week.

29:45.785 --> 29:46.619
Natalie.

29:54.877 --> 29:56.754
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to just show up.

29:58.088 --> 29:59.256
I just didn't know
where else to go.

30:04.512 --> 30:05.638
What happened to you?

30:08.349 --> 30:09.433
Where'd you go?

30:10.976 --> 30:11.936
Where have you been?

30:12.478 --> 30:13.938
You know, I tried to find you.

30:14.563 --> 30:16.022
I called your office,
your home.

30:16.023 --> 30:18.526
I talked to your wife--
everything.

30:19.235 --> 30:20.861
The Unabom case is over.

30:21.111 --> 30:22.696
It was over two years ago.

30:23.864 --> 30:26.242
It's not over, and I need help.

30:26.575 --> 30:28.536
You have to have
some place you can go--

30:29.995 --> 30:32.623
family, somebody other than me.

30:40.047 --> 30:42.758
Hey. Look, look--
We got a friend!

30:43.551 --> 30:44.592
What's your name?

30:44.593 --> 30:45.970
Winston and Jasper.

30:47.429 --> 30:50.014
Look, I-I have to defend
my dissertation in a couple weeks,

30:50.015 --> 30:51.016
so I have to work tonight.

30:55.771 --> 30:57.480
All right, I'm gonna take
these guys to the kitchen.

30:57.481 --> 30:59.483
Why don't you--
Why don't you take a shower?

30:59.900 --> 31:01.193
You can sleep on the couch.

31:01.527 --> 31:03.445
Come on! Come on!

31:18.127 --> 31:19.920
They want me to go in
and interrogate Ted.

31:21.088 --> 31:22.214
They need me.

31:23.716 --> 31:25.592
They need me to get the guilty plea.

31:27.553 --> 31:29.138
I think that...

31:29.847 --> 31:31.932
I think I need to confront him
and get some answers.

31:32.474 --> 31:33.933
You have the answers.

31:33.934 --> 31:36.227
You proved that Ted's the Unabomber.

31:36.228 --> 31:37.979
Answers for myself,

31:37.980 --> 31:39.814
so I can understand
what happened to me

31:39.815 --> 31:42.943
and where I should go from here.

31:43.152 --> 31:45.904
And what makes you think
that he has answers

31:45.905 --> 31:47.489
to any question that matters?

31:50.159 --> 31:51.201
What do you think?

31:51.702 --> 31:53.037
You wanted this.

31:55.581 --> 31:57.207
You wanted him in your life.

31:59.168 --> 32:01.211
Secretly, somehow,
you wanted this.

32:01.879 --> 32:03.297
That's the answer.

32:05.299 --> 32:07.009
That's the only way I can
make sense of what happened.

32:08.344 --> 32:09.761
You wanted him in your life

32:09.762 --> 32:11.639
more than you wanted anyone
or anything else.

32:15.225 --> 32:16.476
Why would I want that?

32:16.477 --> 32:17.853
What kind of person
would want that?

32:23.734 --> 32:26.319
They interview 10,000 Nathan Rs,
and then they turn to me

32:26.320 --> 32:28.488
and say that profiling's
a waste of resources.

32:28.489 --> 32:29.448
Think about that.

32:30.574 --> 32:32.242
You're a cog
in the machine, Fitz.

32:32.618 --> 32:34.035
Embrace it, bruh.

32:39.959 --> 32:42.211
Oh-ho!
There he is.

32:43.087 --> 32:45.881
It's our head shrinker come
to mingle with the commoners.

32:58.268 --> 32:59.644
Hey, where you going, bruh?

32:59.645 --> 33:01.271
Sacramento to do my job.

33:10.447 --> 33:12.073
<i>They want you to obey.</i>

33:12.074 --> 33:15.035
<i>They want you to be a sheep
like they are sheep--</i>

33:15.536 --> 33:18.872
<i>obedient, unquestioning,
piece of machinery.</i>

33:19.748 --> 33:22.459
<i>Sit when told to sit,
stand when told to stand.</i>

33:23.085 --> 33:25.878
<i>They want you to give up
your humanity, your autonomy</i>

33:25.879 --> 33:29.425
<i>for a paycheck,
gold star, bigger TV.</i>

33:31.010 --> 33:32.927
<i>The only way to be human,</i>

33:32.928 --> 33:34.887
<i>the only way to be free,</i>

33:34.888 --> 33:35.973
<i>is to rebel.</i>

33:36.306 --> 33:37.974
<i>They'll try to crush you.</i>

33:37.975 --> 33:40.935
<i>They'll use every tactic they have
to make you obedient,</i>

33:40.936 --> 33:42.687
<i>docile, subservient,</i>

33:42.688 --> 33:43.814
<i>but you can't let them.</i>

33:44.106 --> 33:47.651
<i>You have to be your own master,
whatever that takes.</i>

33:48.610 --> 33:50.361
<i>Better to die a human being</i>

33:50.362 --> 33:52.781
<i>than to live as a purposeless cog
in their machine.</i>

34:20.684 --> 34:22.686
You dropped it in the mail
a week ago.

34:35.157 --> 34:35.991
Gil.

34:38.994 --> 34:39.828
This just came.

35:16.198 --> 35:17.658
You want to be here.

35:21.995 --> 35:23.413
You want to be here,

35:25.707 --> 35:29.545
touching this, savoring it.

35:43.100 --> 35:44.434
But you can't be here.

35:44.935 --> 35:46.186
You can't be here.

35:47.563 --> 35:51.108
Ever. For any of them.

35:54.194 --> 35:57.614
Why is that enough for you
and not any other serial killer?

35:59.867 --> 36:00.993
Never to see it,

36:01.535 --> 36:02.744
hear it,

36:03.579 --> 36:04.580
taste it,

36:06.039 --> 36:08.292
never to see Gil Murray's body.

36:09.501 --> 36:11.086
Because it's not about him.

36:12.337 --> 36:14.715
It's not about him
as an individual, is it?

36:23.307 --> 36:24.808
These aren't people to you.

36:28.353 --> 36:29.521
They're symbols.

36:31.064 --> 36:32.399
You're sending a message.

36:34.067 --> 36:37.196
That's why you use the mail,
'cause it's a message.

36:38.113 --> 36:40.032
It's a hidden message.

36:40.574 --> 36:42.701
And what does it symbolize?

36:43.160 --> 36:44.494
What does it represent?

36:46.663 --> 36:49.082
So, what are you
trying to tell us, FC?

36:52.377 --> 36:53.462
What are you trying to tell me?

36:59.218 --> 37:01.762
"Dad, it is I."

37:05.474 --> 37:07.392
What are you trying
to tell me, FC?

37:12.439 --> 37:13.815
What are you trying to tell me?

37:27.704 --> 37:30.248
Your whole profile is
built on the assumption

37:30.249 --> 37:32.041
that FC was one of
the airline mechanics

37:32.042 --> 37:33.876
that United Airlines laid off
in Cincinnati,

37:33.877 --> 37:36.545
and that he targeted
American Airlines Flight 444

37:36.546 --> 37:39.633
and United president Percy Wood
out of a personal grudge, right?

37:39.841 --> 37:41.217
Right.

37:41.218 --> 37:43.010
But let's think about mail bombs.

37:43.011 --> 37:45.221
He can't hear them, he can't see them,
he can't visit the site,

37:45.222 --> 37:46.639
he can't view the bodies, anything.

37:46.640 --> 37:48.350
It's none of the satisfaction of revenge.

37:48.809 --> 37:50.352
But he keeps bombing anyway.

37:51.228 --> 37:52.520
Why?

37:52.521 --> 37:54.731
Because these aren't personal targets.

37:55.065 --> 37:57.608
They are representational targets.

37:57.609 --> 38:00.569
Gil Murray was a symbol
of something for him.

38:00.570 --> 38:02.489
All of his targets symbolize
something for FC.

38:02.698 --> 38:05.533
We have done every kind
of victimology.

38:05.534 --> 38:07.452
His victims are random,

38:07.744 --> 38:09.579
totally unconnected to each other.

38:10.122 --> 38:11.163
All right.

38:11.164 --> 38:13.291
So he spends years perfecting
the most untraceable,

38:13.292 --> 38:15.251
sophisticated mail bomb
ever created,

38:15.252 --> 38:17.087
and then just picks random targets
from a phone book?

38:19.923 --> 38:21.757
I don't think it was
a random coincidence

38:21.758 --> 38:23.843
that these letters spell
"Dad, it is I,"

38:23.844 --> 38:26.262
and I don't think it's a random
coincidence that he's targeting

38:26.263 --> 38:29.181
airlines, scientists,
computers, forestry people.

38:29.182 --> 38:30.891
I think it only seems random

38:30.892 --> 38:32.601
because we don't know
what connects them.

38:32.602 --> 38:34.604
We can't --
We can't know his code,

38:35.063 --> 38:36.856
and the reason that we don't
know his code is because

38:36.857 --> 38:40.319
we're still assuming he's a low-I.Q.
pissed-off airline mechanic

38:40.944 --> 38:43.113
when he's actually been
outsmarting us the whole time.

38:43.280 --> 38:46.950
We've got hard forensic evidence
that he's a trained airline mechanic.

38:47.951 --> 38:49.119
Look.

38:50.162 --> 38:53.164
Batteries soldered in series,
encased in a wire cage

38:53.165 --> 38:54.833
just like airplane power bricks.

38:56.460 --> 38:59.212
He's an expert at casting
and shaping aluminum.

39:00.088 --> 39:02.424
And look. Look at this new switch
he's developed.

39:02.758 --> 39:05.634
It looks exactly like
an airplane tail stand on a 747.

39:05.635 --> 39:07.720
- We've had pilots confirm that.
- That only looks like a tail stand

39:07.721 --> 39:09.138
if you're looking for proof
of the supposition

39:09.139 --> 39:10.097
that he's an airline mechanic.

39:10.098 --> 39:12.017
If you're objective about it,
it's just a switch.

39:13.727 --> 39:16.604
Do you ever think that the reason
you haven't got him in 17 years

39:16.605 --> 39:18.065
is that you're underestimating him?

39:19.149 --> 39:21.317
There is a powerful intelligence
at work here,

39:21.318 --> 39:24.278
a deep personal philosophy
underpinning all of FC's actions.

39:24.279 --> 39:26.322
Now, you figure out
the philosophy,

39:26.323 --> 39:28.324
you can figure out the man,
you can crack the code.

39:28.325 --> 39:29.993
But not with this.

39:30.827 --> 39:32.578
We have to start over.

39:32.579 --> 39:33.997
Get rid of that and start over.

39:39.294 --> 39:41.463
Fitz, buddy...

39:43.048 --> 39:44.423
you're breaking my heart.

39:48.428 --> 39:52.140
You are part of
a world-class orchestra here.

39:52.808 --> 39:55.017
Lots of instruments,
lots of virtuosos,

39:55.018 --> 39:58.938
and out of all of these players,
I'm pointing to you,

39:58.939 --> 40:02.067
and I'm saying now
is the time for your solo.

40:02.692 --> 40:06.863
Stand up, play your heart out
so the whole world can hear you.

40:09.533 --> 40:12.202
But you gotta play with
the sheet music that I'm giving you.

40:12.786 --> 40:14.870
Because you may be
a once-in-a-century talent,

40:14.871 --> 40:17.874
but if you can't harmonize
with the rest of the orchestra,

40:19.209 --> 40:21.294
I'm gonna have to send you home.

40:39.938 --> 40:41.230
Dude, where have you been?

40:41.231 --> 40:42.565
Why ain't you downstairs?

40:42.566 --> 40:44.024
Didn't Genelli tell you?

40:44.025 --> 40:45.693
I'm going home.
I'm not writing that B.S.

40:45.694 --> 40:47.154
Fitz, you gotta get
down to forensics now.

40:50.907 --> 40:53.367
You said he had
a personal philosophy,

40:53.368 --> 40:55.287
some message
he's trying to send.

40:56.121 --> 40:57.706
You were right.

41:03.587 --> 41:04.921
<i>The New York Times</i> called it in.

41:05.338 --> 41:06.965
They got a package.

41:07.174 --> 41:08.924
Another bomb?

41:08.925 --> 41:10.135
No, it's something else.

41:27.986 --> 41:30.197
They're calling it
the "Unabomber Manifesto."

41:41.917 --> 41:43.835
If you screw this up,
we'll crucify you.
