WEBVTT

00:09.400 --> 00:10.834
...Venture!

00:16.000 --> 00:18.834
My God.
There she is.

00:23.080 --> 00:26.152
Something spooked Swifty
real bad, Dr. V.

00:26.280 --> 00:27.873
I got a bad feeling
about this.

00:28.000 --> 00:31.198
Nonsense, Hector.
He's probably just dehydrated.

00:31.320 --> 00:34.438
Maybe, but that thing looks
kind of super evil, man.

00:36.560 --> 00:39.120
Hmm, well,
I'm no Robert Langdon,

00:39.240 --> 00:41.391
but that ugly customer
probably has something to do

00:41.560 --> 00:43.677
with the so-called
"cursed temple"

00:43.800 --> 00:45.000
the locals
were babbling about.

00:45.080 --> 00:47.231
Thankfully,
as modern men of science,

00:47.400 --> 00:50.154
we're intellectually immune
to such superstitious hokum.

00:56.720 --> 00:59.030
Well, now, this is interesting.

01:06.720 --> 01:09.076
Amazingly well preserved.

01:09.200 --> 01:11.237
It's a miracle
it's survived in one piece.

01:11.360 --> 01:15.036
I know the perfect place for it.

01:15.160 --> 01:18.836
Miraculously surviving
the blistering reentry

01:18.960 --> 01:20.917
and crash of the Gargantua-1,

01:21.040 --> 01:23.794
it stands here today
as a fitting tribute

01:23.920 --> 01:27.038
to the ingenuity
of Dr. Jonas Venture Sr.

01:27.160 --> 01:28.958
- Oh, boy!
- Wow!

01:29.080 --> 01:31.800
And moving along,
if you will step over this way,

01:31.920 --> 01:34.389
you'll see the space suit
worn by Colonel Lloyd Venture.

01:34.520 --> 01:36.910
What?! That's right!

01:37.040 --> 01:40.670
The real first moon landing
happened in 19-aught-2.

Oh, my God.

04:02.720 --> 04:04.313
I'm... I-I-I'm fine.

04:04.440 --> 04:06.113
Someone must have
walked over my grave.

04:06.240 --> 04:07.390
Whoo!

04:07.520 --> 04:09.637
So that was better.

04:09.760 --> 04:11.752
I almost got your shirt off
that time.

04:11.880 --> 04:14.679
Yeah. I tried concentrating
on "Walking Dead" zombies,

04:14.800 --> 04:16.473
but then Michonne showed up.

04:16.600 --> 04:18.176
Hey, Sirena!

04:18.200 --> 04:19.680
Sirena, what are you
doing in there?

04:20.720 --> 04:22.473
Landed on my joystick.

04:22.600 --> 04:24.956
Hey, Usain Bolt.
No kiss good night?

04:25.080 --> 04:26.309
Oh! Sorry.

04:27.480 --> 04:29.160
Hey, you got a boy
in there, Sirena?

04:29.240 --> 04:30.959
Now, get out of here
before Rocco sees you.

04:32.160 --> 04:35.198
What?!
I'm trying to do my yoga!

04:35.320 --> 04:36.595
In your
Victoria's Secret bra?

04:36.720 --> 04:38.136
'Cause usually you wear,
like, a sports...

04:38.160 --> 04:39.216
you know, like, the Free People.

04:39.240 --> 04:40.640
Oh, my God.

04:40.800 --> 04:42.896
What, have you been going
through my underwear drawers?

04:42.920 --> 04:44.296
Race-back. That's what
they call it, right?

04:44.320 --> 04:46.198
Ugh, don't even.
Just get out of my way.

04:46.320 --> 04:47.640
I'ma take a shower right now

04:47.760 --> 04:49.717
to wash your fucking skeeve
off of me.

04:58.680 --> 05:00.080
Maybe you've had
enough coffee?

05:00.200 --> 05:01.634
Maybe we should
call Dr. Orpheus.

05:01.760 --> 05:04.000
- Dean, don't start this again.
- We got to do something.

05:04.080 --> 05:05.958
It's getting worse, Doc.
Every night this week.

05:06.080 --> 05:07.240
Ah!

05:07.320 --> 05:09.755
- Our house is haunted!
- Oh, don't be ridiculous.

05:09.880 --> 05:11.633
This is a brand-new building.

05:11.760 --> 05:13.160
It's obviously
a computer glitch.

05:13.280 --> 05:15.158
Or is it the ghost
of Uncle J.J.?

05:15.280 --> 05:16.873
You said yourself
he appeared to you.

05:17.040 --> 05:18.633
His talking alarm clock
appeared to me.

05:18.760 --> 05:21.036
By your logic,
Clippy the Paperclip haunts me

05:21.160 --> 05:22.640
every time
I try to write a letter.

05:22.800 --> 05:24.837
How do you explain
the weird voices,

05:24.960 --> 05:27.555
the slamming doors,
the cold spots?

05:27.720 --> 05:29.552
Integrated sound system,
automated doors,

05:29.720 --> 05:31.837
central air,
all computer-controlled.

05:31.960 --> 05:36.830
Someone or something wrote
on my stomach from the inside!

05:36.960 --> 05:38.553
Residual nanobots.

05:38.680 --> 05:40.114
Or maybe your stomach
is begging you

05:40.240 --> 05:42.152
to stop
this vegetarian nonsense.

05:42.320 --> 05:44.277
Come on.
Eat a bacon, Dean.

05:44.400 --> 05:46.676
No!
You're not taking this serious!

05:46.800 --> 05:48.200
Just one bacon,
that's all I ask.

05:48.320 --> 05:49.754
- No!
- I'll take it.

05:49.880 --> 05:51.599
And why isn't Hank
being haunted?!

05:51.720 --> 05:52.720
'Cause I'm a good person?

05:52.800 --> 05:54.280
Because nobody's
being haunted!

05:54.400 --> 05:56.198
It's a computer glitch.
Ugh!

05:56.320 --> 05:57.776
In fact, I'm going downstairs
to have it out

05:57.800 --> 05:59.996
with my I.T. guy right now.

06:00.440 --> 06:02.750
Yeah, I came in late.
Have you guys ruled out

06:02.920 --> 06:05.276
"old lighthouse keeper
in a rubber mask" yet?

06:05.400 --> 06:07.710
- Haunted?
- That's what <i>they</i> think, yeah.

06:07.840 --> 06:08.840
I live with children.

06:08.920 --> 06:10.195
I got to admit, it does get

06:10.320 --> 06:11.696
kind of creepy
down here late at night.

06:11.720 --> 06:12.949
Don't you start now.

06:13.080 --> 06:14.230
The system was fine

06:14.360 --> 06:16.056
until this one started
upgrading everything.

06:16.080 --> 06:17.639
One Flash plug-in.

06:17.760 --> 06:19.831
You're the one who just
had to see that cat video.

06:19.960 --> 06:21.679
And it was hilarious!

06:21.800 --> 06:23.896
Now, have you finished hacking
into the mainframe or whatever?

06:23.920 --> 06:24.879
Yeah!

06:24.880 --> 06:26.394
Acid Burn and Zero Cool

06:26.520 --> 06:28.273
helped me
bypass the encryption.

06:28.400 --> 06:29.880
This one.
All right.

06:30.000 --> 06:33.198
I got the code up here now,
and, uh... ah, well.

06:33.320 --> 06:34.993
Huh.
Well, this is weird.

06:35.160 --> 06:36.230
What is it, a virus?

06:36.360 --> 06:38.192
Maybe. I...
It's hard to tell.

06:38.320 --> 06:40.357
This computer's speaking
in tongues or something.

06:40.480 --> 06:44.633
It's like a digital patois
of DOS, Pascal, FORTRAN.

06:44.760 --> 06:46.672
<i>♪ I still hang around ♪</i>

06:46.840 --> 06:48.797
Ugh! There's that
goddamn song again.

06:48.920 --> 06:51.515
I know this song.
"Street Life" by the Crusaders.

06:51.680 --> 06:53.320
It's on the "Sharky's Machine"
soundtrack.

06:53.360 --> 06:54.760
Super.
Just delete it, will you?

06:54.880 --> 06:56.200
I heard enough of this
last night.

06:56.240 --> 06:59.790
Rust, this song isn't <i>in</i>
your music library.

06:59.920 --> 07:00.956
Now, how can you be sure?

07:01.080 --> 07:03.072
There's like 20,000 songs
in there.

07:03.200 --> 07:05.192
I was a college deejay.

07:05.360 --> 07:07.750
This ain't no glitch, Rust.
You are being hacked.

07:07.880 --> 07:09.917
- What? By who?
- I don't know. The Russians?

07:10.040 --> 07:11.759
How about that
Blue Morpho character?

07:11.880 --> 07:13.758
Yeah,
I think we can rule him out.

07:13.880 --> 07:16.111
Yeah, well, whoever's
lurking in this system,

07:16.240 --> 07:19.233
Professor Pete's patented
pink pilgrim cyber-snooper

07:19.360 --> 07:21.795
will root him out
and shut him down.

07:21.960 --> 07:23.679
Sorry, am I supposed
to be impressed

07:23.800 --> 07:25.200
by your little pink dongle?

07:25.320 --> 07:27.391
Oh!
You will be, pally.

07:32.240 --> 07:34.118
It, uh, takes a while to load.

07:34.240 --> 07:36.232
Y... I don't know.
Maybe go get lunch?

07:40.320 --> 07:42.960
Hey, Vincenzo. Got all
the lunch deliveries made.

07:43.080 --> 07:45.720
Just let me wash up, and I'll
help you out with the dough.

07:45.840 --> 07:48.230
- You mind explaining this?
- There's my hat!

07:48.400 --> 07:49.436
Geez, I must have forgot.

07:49.560 --> 07:50.960
How many times I tell you,

07:51.080 --> 07:53.356
when-a you on a delivery,
you represent-a Vincenzo's!

07:53.480 --> 07:54.675
You wear the hat!

07:54.800 --> 07:56.996
Sorry, sir.
It won't happen again.

07:57.160 --> 07:59.755
No, it won't because-a
you fired, Hank Venture!

07:59.880 --> 08:00.779
What?!

08:00.800 --> 08:03.031
Just turn in-a
your polo shirt and go!

08:03.160 --> 08:06.153
You a good boy.
Very good worker.

08:06.280 --> 08:09.830
But you no can
work here no more.

08:09.960 --> 08:12.316
Vincenzo, w-why are
you doing this?

08:12.440 --> 08:15.274
The sign out front,
she may say "Vincenzo,"

08:15.400 --> 08:17.995
but Vincenzo, he no the boss.

08:18.120 --> 08:19.120
Capisce?

08:19.240 --> 08:22.153
<i>La Mano Orca.</i>

08:24.280 --> 08:27.273
Yeah, Vincenzo.
I "ca-pish."

08:54.880 --> 08:57.111
Evil!
Pure evil!

08:57.240 --> 09:00.039
First he locks up my girlfriend,
then he takes my job,

09:00.160 --> 09:01.310
then he vandalizes

09:01.440 --> 09:03.591
my hover-tronic
means of personal conveyance!

09:03.720 --> 09:05.757
He's destroying my life!

09:05.880 --> 09:07.314
Hey, there, uh, slugger.

09:07.480 --> 09:09.790
Who's put the angry little bee
in your bonnet?

09:09.920 --> 09:11.320
Wide Wale.

09:11.440 --> 09:12.954
Wide Wa...
He's not supposed to...

09:13.080 --> 09:14.400
I'm dating his daughter.

09:14.520 --> 09:16.830
Whoa-ho!
Dating the enemy's daughter?

09:16.960 --> 09:21.079
It's like Romeo and Juliet.
Or me and Princess Tiny Feet.

09:21.200 --> 09:23.556
See, her dad was this
Native American crime fighter,

09:23.680 --> 09:25.034
name of Chief Justice.

09:25.160 --> 09:26.879
He just about
went on the warpath

09:27.040 --> 09:28.633
when I proposed
to his little squaw.

09:28.760 --> 09:30.160
Golly.
What'd you do?

09:30.280 --> 09:32.920
I marched right up
to his titanium tepee

09:33.040 --> 09:35.430
with one of my famous baskets
of howdy-do.

09:35.560 --> 09:38.359
- And that worked?
- No! He shot me on the spot.

09:38.480 --> 09:41.279
You know what I did?
I shot him right back.

09:42.360 --> 09:43.680
Uh...

09:43.800 --> 09:47.032
- A-Are they here yet?
- Who? The ghosts?

09:47.160 --> 09:49.800
Hear me, Ventures!

09:49.920 --> 09:52.594
See me!

09:52.720 --> 09:57.556
Never fear!
The Order of the Triad is here!

09:58.640 --> 10:00.950
Uh, almost.

10:13.640 --> 10:15.279
New York,
just like I pictured it...

10:15.400 --> 10:17.517
skyscrapers and everything.

10:17.640 --> 10:19.440
Damn, my blood eye
had its freak on

10:19.520 --> 10:20.874
since we hit Jersey.

10:21.000 --> 10:22.376
Town must be crawling
with blaculas.

10:22.400 --> 10:23.616
You sure it ain't
just allergies?

10:23.640 --> 10:25.040
I packed the Claritin.

10:25.160 --> 10:26.913
What you got,
the regular or the D?

10:27.040 --> 10:28.918
- D.
- Aw, no way, man.

10:29.040 --> 10:31.714
Can't do the D.
Gives me the jimjams.

10:38.360 --> 10:40.477
<i>Da! What the fuck!</i>

10:40.600 --> 10:41.829
<i>Language, tadpole!</i>

10:41.960 --> 10:44.953
<i>Fine, why the shit are your
goons welding my windows shut?</i>

10:45.120 --> 10:46.395
What am I,
your prisoner now?

10:46.520 --> 10:47.795
It ain't like that,
sweetheart.

10:47.920 --> 10:49.639
I'm just trying
to keep you safe.

10:49.760 --> 10:53.231
Ugh! From who? Hank?
He's a nice boy, Pop.

10:53.360 --> 10:55.795
He's an outsider!
<i>Figlio del nemico.</i>

10:55.920 --> 10:57.070
He ain't family.

10:57.200 --> 10:58.736
So, what, I'm supposed
to date my <i>family?</i>

10:58.760 --> 10:59.989
Okay, Dad.

11:00.120 --> 11:02.237
I'll hook up with cousin
Salvatore with the lazy eye.

11:02.360 --> 11:03.920
We'll pop out a bunch
of flipper babies.

11:04.040 --> 11:05.952
<i>This</i> is why I barred
your windows.

11:06.080 --> 11:08.993
This Blue Morpho,
he don't play by the rules.

11:09.120 --> 11:11.510
<i>I can't risk nothing
happening to you.</i>

11:11.640 --> 11:14.280
Hey, Hank.
What are you doing?

11:14.440 --> 11:16.716
N-Nothing.
What are <i>you</i> doing?

11:16.840 --> 11:18.672
Nothing.

11:18.800 --> 11:21.076
Thank you for coming
on such short notice.

11:21.240 --> 11:23.800
My apologies for appearing
in my astral form,

11:23.920 --> 11:25.912
but the Triad and I
are currently ensconced

11:26.080 --> 11:27.753
in bumper-upon-bumper traffic

11:27.880 --> 11:30.111
on your
Franklin Delano Roosevelt Drive.

11:30.240 --> 11:32.675
Is Mr. Samson
not joining us?

11:32.800 --> 11:35.759
He refuses to sleep in here.
That's how serious this is.

11:35.920 --> 11:37.673
It's scare-a-Brock spooky.

11:37.840 --> 11:40.275
Oh, great.
You called him.

11:40.400 --> 11:42.119
But I had to.
You wouldn't listen.

11:42.240 --> 11:43.720
You just kept
mansplaining it away.

11:43.840 --> 11:45.240
I was science-splaining.

11:45.360 --> 11:46.776
And I told you,
it's a computer glitch.

11:46.800 --> 11:48.792
We don't need a "magic man."

11:48.920 --> 11:51.355
Dr. Byron Orpheus!

11:51.520 --> 11:52.520
Master metaphysician,

11:52.521 --> 11:55.558
president and founder
of the Order of the Triad.

11:55.680 --> 11:56.680
Yes.
Hello, Orpheus.

11:56.720 --> 11:57.915
- I know you.
- Oh, do you?

11:58.040 --> 12:00.760
Seven unaccepted friend requests
would suggest otherwise.

12:00.880 --> 12:02.280
Never said I was your friend.

12:02.400 --> 12:05.472
You are indeed, and despite
your cheeky nonchalance,

12:05.600 --> 12:06.954
a friend in need.

12:07.120 --> 12:10.192
Your boy, here, has apprised me
of your supernatural quandary.

12:10.320 --> 12:12.232
Oh, damn!
They got a pool!

12:12.360 --> 12:14.238
Sweet!
I packed my trunks.

12:14.360 --> 12:17.398
Eh, you must forgive the boyish
exuberance of my compeers.

12:17.520 --> 12:19.557
Since the fire which consumed
your former compound,

12:19.680 --> 12:21.831
the Triad have been
temporarily headquartered

12:21.960 --> 12:23.360
in the comparatively
modest lodgings

12:23.480 --> 12:25.995
of the Rancho Feo Motor Hotel.

12:26.120 --> 12:29.113
- That shithole out on I-25?
- The same.

12:29.240 --> 12:31.709
You, however, have done quite
well for yourself, Mr. Venture.

12:31.840 --> 12:33.479
Heated! It's heated!

12:33.600 --> 12:36.513
But I fear your success
comes at a spiritual price.

12:36.640 --> 12:41.032
Since the moment I arrived,
my extrasensory, um, senses

12:41.160 --> 12:44.119
have been acutely aware
of an unseen presence.

12:44.280 --> 12:48.911
Mr. Venture,
your home is possessed!

12:54.720 --> 12:55.995
Boy, hacker movies

12:56.120 --> 12:58.271
always make this seem
way more exciting.

12:58.400 --> 13:00.119
Yeah, without
the dramatic close-ups

13:00.240 --> 13:01.879
and, like,
a booming techno score,

13:02.000 --> 13:04.071
real-life hacking
is just typing.

13:04.200 --> 13:06.112
Throw me a bone, dude.
All right.

13:06.240 --> 13:09.153
Just turn to be dramatically
and say, "We're in."

13:09.280 --> 13:10.316
We're in.

13:10.440 --> 13:12.113
Yes! Boom.

13:17.200 --> 13:19.192
- Oh!
- Oh! What the...

13:20.280 --> 13:22.078
Ooh.
How's that for exciting, huh?

13:22.200 --> 13:23.554
Screw this!
I'm out of here.

13:23.680 --> 13:24.680
Wait a minute.

13:24.800 --> 13:26.736
Rusty said we had to stay here
until this is fixed.

13:26.760 --> 13:29.320
Uh, <i>you're</i> the computer expert.
You stay.

13:29.440 --> 13:32.114
This neurogeneticist
is going the hell home.

13:33.360 --> 13:36.512
All right. Looks like it's just
you and me, little pink pally.

13:36.640 --> 13:38.552
Time to find out what you know.

13:43.040 --> 13:44.759
Oh, you got to
be kidding me.

13:44.880 --> 13:47.520
Greetings.
We got off on the wrong foot.

13:47.680 --> 13:49.239
Allow me
to introduce myself.

13:49.360 --> 13:50.476
My name is Hank Venture.

13:50.640 --> 13:53.200
I seek an audience with
the great and powerful Wide Wale

13:53.320 --> 13:54.959
to bargain
for his daughter's hand.

13:55.080 --> 13:56.400
As a token of my goodwill,

13:56.560 --> 13:59.598
I present to you a gift...
this artisanal pizza.

13:59.720 --> 14:02.394
Kid, you really don't know
how to take a hint,

14:02.520 --> 14:04.876
so, uh, let me spell it out
for you, Hank Venture.

14:05.000 --> 14:07.390
You so much as even look
at Sirena again,

14:07.520 --> 14:09.318
you'll lose more
than your job, hotpants.

14:09.440 --> 14:12.638
50,000 volts
straight to your braciole.

14:12.760 --> 14:15.559
Zap. Nothing but taint
left down there.

14:15.680 --> 14:18.639
My mistake.
D-Don't worry.

14:18.760 --> 14:21.673
You won't be seeing
Hank Venture again.

14:21.800 --> 14:23.439
Oh, I ain't worried, peaches.

14:25.120 --> 14:27.316
Light of the ancients.

14:27.440 --> 14:28.999
Light which is white.

14:29.120 --> 14:30.554
Light of all knowing.

14:30.720 --> 14:34.157
Reveal the unseen
in the shadows of night!

14:34.280 --> 14:36.590
Great, does this make us all
Green Lanterns now?

14:36.720 --> 14:39.235
The Spell of Revelation
compels the demonic presence

14:39.360 --> 14:41.750
to become visible,
that we may do battle with it.

14:41.880 --> 14:43.376
See, this is why I didn't
want Dean to call you,

14:43.400 --> 14:44.720
this kind of crap right here.

14:44.840 --> 14:46.800
Did you have to get paint
all over my nice marble?

14:46.920 --> 14:48.559
The circle's
for your protection.

14:48.680 --> 14:50.360
You don't want to do this
without a circle.

14:50.440 --> 14:52.477
There was already
a huge circle here!

14:52.600 --> 14:53.600
Wasn't magic.

14:53.680 --> 14:55.911
Can we please focus, gentlemen?

14:56.080 --> 14:57.355
The demon will try to use

14:57.480 --> 14:59.233
your thoughts and desires
against you.

14:59.360 --> 15:02.034
All of you, clear your minds.

15:02.160 --> 15:04.038
Al, stop thinking
about that robot.

15:04.160 --> 15:06.117
I can't help it.
He's nutsy.

15:06.240 --> 15:07.799
Hey, O,
demon ain't gonna bring up

15:07.920 --> 15:09.195
what happened to my mama,
is it?

15:09.320 --> 15:10.959
Well, it will now.

15:11.080 --> 15:13.675
Yo, demon, no mamas!

15:23.040 --> 15:25.111
Okay.
Those are new.

15:25.240 --> 15:27.436
You're making this worse now!

15:28.840 --> 15:30.718
Easy, girl! Easy!

15:30.840 --> 15:32.433
Uncle Kano's our guest.

15:32.560 --> 15:34.597
You know Kano.
It's Kano.

15:34.720 --> 15:38.031
Oh, goodness. I don't know
what's gotten into Mischa today.

15:38.160 --> 15:40.117
Racist!
Racist dog right there.

15:40.240 --> 15:42.675
Should have seen her haul off
on the Con Ed guy yesterday.

15:42.800 --> 15:44.632
Oh, it's just
her eyesight's going.

15:44.760 --> 15:47.878
- She's got the cataracts.
- Hot spots and the mange.

15:48.000 --> 15:50.196
You should just
put her down already, Horace.

15:50.320 --> 15:51.515
Put <i>you</i> down.

15:51.640 --> 15:53.871
This old gal's still got
a lot of fight in her.

15:54.000 --> 15:57.118
Don't you, girl? Don't you?
Oh! Thieving black terror!

15:57.240 --> 15:59.118
Go on, then!
Have your prize!

15:59.240 --> 16:01.516
Don't come crying to me
when you have the trots!

16:01.640 --> 16:04.712
I'm home! Please tell me
you're all decent this time.

16:04.840 --> 16:07.639
Eh, pull up a chair, laddie.
Wee bit of dim sum left.

16:07.760 --> 16:10.355
Or you're welcome to fight
Mischa for the last rib.

16:10.480 --> 16:11.709
Say, uh, where's your

16:11.840 --> 16:13.797
pigmentally challenged
better half?

16:13.920 --> 16:16.276
Ah, Rusty made him stay late
to fix the computer.

16:16.400 --> 16:18.357
Thinks we have
a hacker or something.

16:18.480 --> 16:19.760
The screen just
totally went nuts

16:19.840 --> 16:21.856
and started blasting the theme
from "Sharky's Machine."

16:24.000 --> 16:26.515
Oh, my.
What is it, Rodney?

16:26.640 --> 16:28.279
Boys looks like
you've seen a ghost.

16:28.400 --> 16:32.110
Oh, no. It's nothing
like that, Rose. It's just...

16:32.240 --> 16:34.516
- Dude!
- She'll be fine in an hour.

16:34.680 --> 16:36.990
Rodney, fetch us an Uber.

16:37.120 --> 16:41.592
Now tell me, how long
has Rusty had the PROBLEM?

16:44.680 --> 16:45.909
Shoo!

16:46.040 --> 16:47.759
Hey, Al,
what are they saying?

16:47.880 --> 16:50.634
Uh, "mask" something...
"gold mask"?

16:50.760 --> 16:52.558
They... They want
their mask back.

16:52.680 --> 16:54.560
Tell them they can have it.
It's right up there.

16:55.960 --> 16:58.680
That is most definitely
not a tumbaga mask.

16:58.800 --> 16:59.995
What is that?

17:00.160 --> 17:01.240
Uh, I made it in art class.

17:01.280 --> 17:03.033
Who told you
you could take art?

17:03.160 --> 17:04.719
God, is that Scamp 1?

17:04.839 --> 17:05.839
Aww!

17:05.960 --> 17:09.920
Launched aboard the VenStar 1
lunar probe in 1966,

17:10.040 --> 17:13.431
Scamp 1 was the first dog
to die on the moon.

17:13.560 --> 17:14.519
Aw.

17:14.520 --> 17:16.477
<i>You locked all the doors!</i>

17:16.599 --> 17:18.512
Holy hat factory!

17:18.680 --> 17:20.830
It's the victims of
the great Venture millinery fire

17:20.960 --> 17:22.314
of 19-aught-7!

17:22.440 --> 17:24.829
The deadly blaze
began in the attic

17:24.960 --> 17:28.431
when a dumpster full of felt
straps was struck by a zeppelin.

17:28.560 --> 17:30.756
Yes, yes, we're getting
off topic here, Sergeant.

17:30.880 --> 17:32.473
Please disperse, spirits.

17:32.600 --> 17:34.990
Please,
just move into the light!

17:35.120 --> 17:37.032
Or don't.
I really don't care.

17:37.200 --> 17:38.793
We're attempting
to speak to another.

17:38.920 --> 17:42.630
Demon, show thyself!

17:49.400 --> 17:53.633
<i>♪ I still hang around ♪</i>

17:53.800 --> 17:56.872
I'll say this... Vincenzo makes
the best slice in the city.

17:57.000 --> 17:58.576
Yeah,
almost makes up for him

17:58.600 --> 18:00.353
scuffing my knuckles
with his face.

18:04.400 --> 18:06.392
Rocco?

18:15.840 --> 18:17.274
Daddy, what's going on?

18:17.400 --> 18:18.959
Go back to your room,
tadpole.

18:19.080 --> 18:20.514
Daddy will handle this.

18:20.640 --> 18:24.600
Slippery little son of a bitch,
ain't you, Morpho?

18:24.720 --> 18:26.200
I don't know
how you got past my boys,

18:26.280 --> 18:28.431
but you're swimming
with the big fish now.

18:28.560 --> 18:30.074
Show yourself!

18:33.920 --> 18:35.195
Who the hell are <i>you?</i>

18:35.320 --> 18:37.357
Allow me
to introduce-a myself.

18:37.480 --> 18:40.598
<i>Mi chiamo</i> Matassa.
Enrico Matassa.

18:40.760 --> 18:43.832
Never heard of you.
So, uh, what is this?

18:43.960 --> 18:46.111
New guy in town
trying to make his rep

18:46.240 --> 18:47.913
by taking out
the alpha whale?

18:48.040 --> 18:49.793
More like an audition.

18:49.920 --> 18:53.072
You see how easy Enrico Matassa
take out-a you best men.

18:53.200 --> 18:54.714
Well, that is just a taste

18:54.840 --> 18:57.594
of Enrico Matassa's
many-a talents.

18:57.720 --> 18:59.996
<i>Per favore,</i>
Don Wide Wale,

19:00.120 --> 19:04.558
Enrico Matassa wants
to come work for you.

19:06.720 --> 19:08.916
Triad, gird thyselves.

19:09.080 --> 19:11.072
The demon may try
to lash out.

19:14.640 --> 19:16.597
Your robot is in the thrall
of the demon!

19:16.720 --> 19:19.792
<i>He</i> is the Devil's concubine!

19:21.280 --> 19:23.078
Probably a computer glitch.

19:23.760 --> 19:27.231
Quickly, Jefferson!
The Prisebar of St. George!

19:27.360 --> 19:29.556
Uh, I...
It's back in the Blood Vessel.

19:29.680 --> 19:31.558
Your sword, then!
Make haste!

19:39.400 --> 19:40.959
Rusty, wait! Don't!

19:46.440 --> 19:48.193
What... What the hell is that?

19:48.320 --> 19:49.674
Rusty, we can explain.

19:49.800 --> 19:51.075
Oh, no.
No, no, no, no.

19:51.200 --> 19:53.635
- That can't be! That isn't...
- Rusty.

19:54.320 --> 19:55.879
That's your pop-pop.

19:57.920 --> 19:59.593
Now, I want you to understand

19:59.760 --> 20:01.274
what you're getting into,
youngblood.

20:01.400 --> 20:05.872
Joining the crew, it's, uh,
like a sacred covenant, yeah?

20:06.000 --> 20:08.754
You walk through this door,
ain't no turning back.

20:08.880 --> 20:11.156
Uh, are you gonna baptize me?

20:11.280 --> 20:13.158
Something like that.

20:13.280 --> 20:15.840
Relax, Matassa.

20:15.960 --> 20:17.360
You want in this family,

20:17.480 --> 20:19.915
you got to do one thing
for me first.

20:21.760 --> 20:23.638
Kill this asshole.

20:23.760 --> 20:25.877
The brain is alive,

20:26.000 --> 20:29.152
but it's in a semicomatose
state, but look at this.

20:29.280 --> 20:32.079
Somehow it's hardwired
to all the building's systems.

20:32.200 --> 20:34.078
It's like a synthetic
nervous system.

20:34.200 --> 20:36.078
There's even a makeshift
digestive tract

20:36.200 --> 20:39.079
providing nutrients
to his biologic... wow. Ew!

20:39.200 --> 20:41.760
Excellent source of protein.
Zero net carbs.

20:41.880 --> 20:44.076
You people did this?
What kind of sick...

20:44.200 --> 20:46.400
Why did you stick my father's
head in the PROBLEM light?

20:46.520 --> 20:48.671
It's pronounced "PRO-BLEM"...

20:48.800 --> 20:51.634
Progressive Biological
Life Extension Module.

20:51.760 --> 20:53.558
Ol' Jonas gave Team Venture

20:53.680 --> 20:56.115
explicit orders to place
his body in the PROBLEM

20:56.240 --> 20:58.072
in the event of his death.

20:58.200 --> 21:01.398
Geez, I'm gonna have to redo
all the narration on this tour.

21:01.520 --> 21:03.398
Well, why didn't
anyone ever tell me?!

21:03.520 --> 21:06.319
Well, wasn't much of him left
for the PROBLEM to work with.

21:06.440 --> 21:09.035
We never expected
the blasted light to come on.

21:09.200 --> 21:11.954
And in 30 years,
it just never did.

21:12.120 --> 21:14.396
- Yeah, it did. A couple...

21:14.520 --> 21:16.159

21:21.720 --> 21:25.430

Oh, dear.

21:55.080 --> 21:56.434
He's trying to...

21:56.560 --> 21:58.711
