WEBVTT

00:02.280 --> 00:02.980
<i>Previously on "Switched at Birth"...</i>

00:03.014 --> 00:04.515
I never felt at home at Buckner.

00:04.549 --> 00:06.650
Going to Carlton doesn't make any sense.

00:06.685 --> 00:08.552
They do have this new pilot program

00:08.586 --> 00:11.422
for kids with deaf
parents or deaf siblings.

00:11.456 --> 00:13.424
We need somebody that
everybody's familiar with.

00:13.458 --> 00:15.025
Like a brand.

00:15.060 --> 00:17.194
John, you're a leader.
You deserve a third act.

00:17.228 --> 00:18.162
Think about it.

00:18.196 --> 00:20.130
No turning back now.

00:20.165 --> 00:22.926
I thought maybe you wanted to know
that you had another one on the way.

00:22.927 --> 00:25.230
_

00:25.737 --> 00:27.938
She hates me for no
reason, other than the fact

00:27.972 --> 00:28.906
that I'm hearing.

00:31.976 --> 00:33.610
Look, I don't know what your deal is.

00:33.645 --> 00:36.413
If this is something about Emmett or...

00:36.414 --> 00:39.166
_

00:39.167 --> 00:42.811
_

00:46.391 --> 00:49.293
So I re-read "The Scarlet Letter"

00:49.327 --> 00:52.429
and I learned all of the relevant signs.

00:52.464 --> 00:54.364
"Adultery, "hypocrisy,"

00:54.399 --> 00:57.334
"who thought it was a good
idea to cast Demi Moore

00:57.402 --> 00:59.937
as Hester Prynne?" And I have not

00:59.971 --> 01:03.240
slowed down the class
once in the last week.

01:03.708 --> 01:07.015
_

01:08.179 --> 01:09.146
(Sighs) Well, uh,

01:09.180 --> 01:10.214
next up, Shakespeare.

01:10.248 --> 01:12.883
I may have to use up my sick days.

01:14.017 --> 01:16.379
_

01:16.380 --> 01:20.023
Yeah. Hey, um, maybe we can
even sit with your old crew.

01:27.398 --> 01:28.665
Or not.

01:36.441 --> 01:41.409

01:44.682 --> 01:45.716
Nice work.

01:48.620 --> 01:51.321
Noah. Pilot program.

01:51.356 --> 01:52.689
We have like every class together.

01:52.724 --> 01:55.292
Noah, I know who you are.

01:55.326 --> 01:57.528
There's only like seven of us.

01:57.562 --> 02:00.330
I'm sorry. Look, I'm distracted right now.

02:00.365 --> 02:03.233
Trying to fix this. Someone wrote
something really nasty on my locker.

02:03.268 --> 02:04.268
Oh, yeah.

02:04.302 --> 02:07.271
They shoved a note in mine too.

02:07.305 --> 02:08.672
There's Ms. Bledsoe.

02:08.705 --> 02:10.440
Maybe we should tell her.

02:10.475 --> 02:13.277
Uh, yeah. And add "rat"

02:13.311 --> 02:14.545
to my list of crimes
against deaf humanity?

02:14.579 --> 02:16.346
No, thank you.

02:19.759 --> 02:21.090
_

02:21.091 --> 02:23.253
Uhh...

02:23.288 --> 02:25.489
just personalizing my locker.

02:26.465 --> 02:28.592
_

02:28.593 --> 02:31.728
Uh, "let" may be too strong of a word.

Where's a volleyball
when you need one, huh?

02:54.319 --> 02:55.652
You heard about that?

02:55.687 --> 02:57.487
(Chuckles)

03:01.426 --> 03:03.627
<i>Daphne: Something happened.
But Bay won't say what.</i>

03:03.661 --> 03:07.631
Some of the deaf kids don't
like the pilot program.

03:07.665 --> 03:10.634
You'd think that people who
had been bullied themselves

03:10.668 --> 03:13.303
would be the last ones
to do it to someone else.

03:15.340 --> 03:16.406
But Bay's all right?

03:16.441 --> 03:17.641
She seems to be.

03:19.611 --> 03:22.312
Can you finish up?

03:22.347 --> 03:23.513
<i>My telenovela is on.</i>

03:23.548 --> 03:26.583
Mom, wait. I need to talk to you.

03:26.618 --> 03:27.584
Both of you.

03:27.619 --> 03:29.353
<i>I know that tone.</i>

03:29.387 --> 03:31.288
- Angelo.
- Yes.

03:31.322 --> 03:32.289
It's Angelo.

03:33.591 --> 03:34.791
He's gonna be a father again.

03:34.826 --> 03:36.760
- What?!
- You're pregnant?!

03:36.794 --> 03:38.428
No. Not me.

03:38.463 --> 03:40.731
He got someone else pregnant?

03:42.500 --> 03:43.467
Yeah.

03:43.501 --> 03:44.668
Of course he did.

03:44.702 --> 03:47.337
Do we know who she is?

03:47.372 --> 03:49.539
Her name is Lana.

03:49.574 --> 03:51.608
And she's a medical student at U.M.K.C.

03:53.745 --> 03:54.778
Young. Of course.

03:54.812 --> 03:58.415
<i>They met on the plane going back to Italy.</i>

03:58.449 --> 04:00.417
(Chuckling) Oh, that's just perfect.

04:00.451 --> 04:02.586
Mom! Please. Can I get through this?

04:02.620 --> 04:03.787
Is she African-American?

04:03.821 --> 04:05.689
- Pretty?
- Yeah.

04:06.824 --> 04:08.558
You know her?

04:08.593 --> 04:10.560
She came to the court looking for Angelo,

04:10.595 --> 04:12.763
and both Bay and Daphne met her.

04:12.797 --> 04:14.498
They just didn't know who she was.

04:14.532 --> 04:16.833
Bay knows?

04:16.868 --> 04:18.402
Everyone knows.

04:19.437 --> 04:22.639
I'm sorry I didn't tell
you when I found out.

04:22.674 --> 04:24.808
But I knew what you would say.

04:24.842 --> 04:27.511
And it seemed as if you and Angelo
had finally buried the hatchet.

04:27.545 --> 04:29.780
I know where I'd like to bury a hatchet.

04:29.814 --> 04:31.682
<i>Isn't your novela starting?</i>

04:31.716 --> 04:34.651
Yes, but they're bound to be a letdown.

04:34.686 --> 04:36.586
<i>Nothing they write in the telenovelas</i>

04:36.621 --> 04:38.755
can hold a candle to Angelo's real life.

04:43.828 --> 04:45.696
<i>(Door closes)</i>

04:45.730 --> 04:46.863
I'm sorry, honey.

04:46.898 --> 04:50.534
Honestly, it really doesn't affect me.

04:50.568 --> 04:51.535
Are you okay?

04:51.569 --> 04:53.804
I really thought he had changed.

04:55.606 --> 04:57.808
Hey, do you remember that day spa

04:57.842 --> 04:59.676
that you and I went to when I

04:59.711 --> 05:01.812
hurt my shoulder playing basketball?

05:01.846 --> 05:03.547
Yeah.

05:03.581 --> 05:05.716
Let's go there again. This weekend.

05:05.750 --> 05:07.451
Just you and me.

05:07.485 --> 05:10.387
It'll be a "suck it, Angelo" spa party.

05:10.421 --> 05:11.555
And he can pay for it.

05:11.589 --> 05:13.357
I'll use the money from the food truck.

05:14.425 --> 05:16.426
That sounds fantastic.

05:16.461 --> 05:17.594
Perfect.

05:22.867 --> 05:24.568
Ivan: For the first few events,

05:24.602 --> 05:26.737
- you'll be preaching totally to the choir.
- John: Uh-huh.

05:26.771 --> 05:28.472
Give you a chance to work out

05:28.506 --> 05:29.673
- your stump speech.
- Okay.

05:29.707 --> 05:31.641
Oh, and Kathryn, we've got you booked

05:31.676 --> 05:33.643
on Dara Walker's radio show.

05:33.678 --> 05:35.645
So you can share your favorite recipe

05:35.680 --> 05:37.681
- with all of her listeners.
- Great.

05:37.715 --> 05:39.483
Sorry to interrupt. Uh, mom, can I borrow

05:39.517 --> 05:40.484
your car again?

05:40.518 --> 05:42.452
I gotta go to rehearsal.

05:42.487 --> 05:44.621
Oh, sure, honey. When
is yours gonna be fixed?

05:44.655 --> 05:45.689
Not till Saturday.

05:45.723 --> 05:47.491
<i>Thanks, though.</i>

05:47.525 --> 05:48.658
Okay, see you.

05:48.693 --> 05:50.827
Mm. Ivan, here's the thing.

05:50.862 --> 05:53.397
I'm not interested in
memorizing talking points.

05:53.431 --> 05:55.665
It's one of the things
that drives me crazy

05:55.700 --> 05:57.501
when I watch these national guys campaign.

05:57.535 --> 05:59.436
- It's just the same canned crap...
- (Ivan chuckles)

05:59.470 --> 06:01.671
over and over and over.

06:01.706 --> 06:03.740
And John's great at speaking off-the-cuff.

06:03.775 --> 06:05.776
We've been getting very
familiar with the issues.

06:05.810 --> 06:08.712
I'd like to focus on
education and immigration.

06:08.746 --> 06:09.746
And you will.

06:09.781 --> 06:11.415
When you get elected.

06:11.449 --> 06:13.650
During the campaign, the
trick is to keep it general.

06:13.684 --> 06:15.819
Pro-middle class, anti-big government.

06:15.853 --> 06:16.820
<i>But I think what</i>

06:16.854 --> 06:18.789
John has to say on

06:18.823 --> 06:20.757
<i>education and immigration</i>

06:20.792 --> 06:22.859
will really resonate with
people in our district.

06:22.894 --> 06:24.694
You're running in a conservative district

06:24.729 --> 06:26.930
in a solidly G.O.P. state.
People love you.

06:26.964 --> 06:30.534
All you have to do to get
elected is to be yourself,

06:30.568 --> 06:31.768
talk about your business successes

06:31.803 --> 06:33.737
and tell that great story
about the home run you hit

06:33.771 --> 06:34.771
in the '92 all-star game.

06:34.772 --> 06:37.774
You can't lose.

06:38.910 --> 06:40.644
Hey, this is the recipe you should share.

06:40.678 --> 06:42.646
These are delicious.

06:43.948 --> 06:45.582
I bought 'em.

06:45.616 --> 06:47.484
Hmm.

06:47.518 --> 06:50.654
I am gonna make stickers.

06:50.688 --> 06:53.423
If Natalie wants to fight
it out with graffiti,

06:53.458 --> 06:55.492
she picked the wrong girl.

06:55.829 --> 06:58.587
_

06:59.163 --> 07:01.198
She is the one who is throwing gasoline.

07:01.232 --> 07:03.266
And I've tried to make peace.

07:03.301 --> 07:06.269
And I'm trying to keep up,
but she just keeps hating me

07:06.304 --> 07:08.205
because I can hear.

07:08.239 --> 07:10.974
And that's like hating me

07:11.008 --> 07:13.877
because I have brown hair or brown eyes.

07:13.911 --> 07:16.847
There's nothing that I can do about it.

07:18.253 --> 07:21.574
_

07:21.575 --> 07:25.950
_

07:25.951 --> 07:28.531
_

07:30.294 --> 07:31.561
Wow, that sucks.

07:34.265 --> 07:38.201
But we didn't ask for any cuts.

07:38.236 --> 07:40.103
And if Natalie and her posse

07:40.138 --> 07:42.139
keep taking it out on the hearing kids,

07:42.173 --> 07:43.294
we're just gonna fight back.

07:53.046 --> 07:55.416
_

07:56.949 --> 08:00.423
_

08:00.424 --> 08:04.670
_

08:04.671 --> 08:05.671
_

08:06.893 --> 08:10.204
_

08:10.205 --> 08:13.212
_

08:14.385 --> 08:17.161
_

08:17.162 --> 08:19.895
_

08:21.066 --> 08:23.705
_

08:24.799 --> 08:27.539
_

08:31.923 --> 08:33.557
Hi. Uh, Noah.

08:33.591 --> 08:35.692
- Bay: Very funny.
- (Chuckles)

08:35.726 --> 08:38.628
Are you ready for the A.S.L. test?

08:38.663 --> 08:40.830
Uh, yes. You?

08:40.865 --> 08:44.467
I think I understand everything.

08:44.502 --> 08:47.370
Mm, except for "understand."

08:47.405 --> 08:48.772
This is "understand."

08:48.806 --> 08:50.640
You signed "horny."

08:50.675 --> 08:53.376
Mm. Crap.

08:53.411 --> 08:55.012
I haven't gotten one full sentence right.

08:56.581 --> 08:59.416
Great, what do you think they've cut now?

09:01.452 --> 09:02.485
Hey, what's going on?

09:02.486 --> 09:05.190
_

09:05.191 --> 09:08.630
_

09:09.093 --> 09:10.260
"Student tolerance retreat this weekend.

09:10.294 --> 09:12.162
- Attendance mandatory."
- (Bay sighs)

09:12.196 --> 09:13.356
I'm guessing I'm on the list.

09:13.364 --> 09:15.198
Bet I am too.

09:15.233 --> 09:17.802
I'm guessing so is she.

09:17.803 --> 09:19.315
_

09:25.676 --> 09:26.843
Thanks.

09:32.650 --> 09:33.583
"Crybaby."

09:35.454 --> 09:38.533
_

09:53.365 --> 09:55.366
So it's all of the pilot program kids

09:55.400 --> 09:57.902
and some of the deaf kids?

09:57.936 --> 09:59.136
Yup.

09:59.171 --> 10:01.205
At a tolerance retreat?

10:01.240 --> 10:02.840
Mm-hmm.

10:02.875 --> 10:04.809
But there isn't a problem?

10:13.519 --> 10:15.586
Okay, maybe there were
a few misunderstandings.

10:15.621 --> 10:18.623
But that's just because the
whole thing is new to everyone.

10:18.657 --> 10:21.792
Bay, I know you feel like you have to
make it sound like everything is fine

10:21.827 --> 10:23.461
because you pushed so hard, but...

10:23.495 --> 10:25.329
Mom, everything is fine.

10:25.364 --> 10:27.265
And I promise if I need you guys,

10:27.299 --> 10:29.367
I will tell you, okay?

10:29.401 --> 10:31.235
<i>- Okay.
- Okay.</i>

10:31.270 --> 10:32.303
Have fun.

10:32.337 --> 10:35.406
<i>(Door opens and closes)</i>

10:35.440 --> 10:37.208
I knew this school wasn't a good idea.

10:43.015 --> 10:44.081
At Buckner,

10:44.116 --> 10:46.784
when there were problems
with groups of kids,

10:46.818 --> 10:49.059
we would have assemblies...
we'd do trust falls in the gym

10:49.087 --> 10:51.722
or pass around like a talking stick.

10:51.757 --> 10:54.859
We were not sent into the woods
to reenact "The Hunger Games."

10:54.893 --> 10:56.694
Maybe you should have thought about that

10:56.728 --> 10:59.263
before you hit Natalie with a volleyball.

10:59.298 --> 11:01.432
(Scoffs) I apologized for that.

11:01.466 --> 11:04.268
And then she was the
one who bombed my locker.

11:04.303 --> 11:07.371
Oh, so you're just an
innocent victim in all of this.

11:07.406 --> 11:10.107
I told I was sorry you
and the leadership kids

11:10.142 --> 11:13.177
got dragged into this,
but maybe if you weren't

11:13.211 --> 11:15.212
such an upstanding student...

11:15.247 --> 11:18.082
Wait, now it's my fault that I
have to spend my weekend doing this?

11:18.116 --> 11:20.117
No, I'm just saying it's not my fault.

11:20.152 --> 11:21.752
Okay, I was supposed to bring my mom

11:21.787 --> 11:22.954
to the spa this weekend,

11:22.988 --> 11:25.623
because she was feeling
so bad about Angelo

11:25.657 --> 11:26.991
and his new baby.

11:27.025 --> 11:30.461
Something that you didn't
bother telling me about.

11:30.495 --> 11:31.596
Why didn't you tell me?

11:32.698 --> 11:34.465
I should have, I know.

11:34.499 --> 11:37.635
But when I found out, Regina didn't know.

11:37.669 --> 11:42.173
And then Angelo and I
got into this big fight.

11:42.207 --> 11:43.507
I'm sorry.

11:43.542 --> 11:45.443
I have to go get the rest of my stuff.

11:48.981 --> 11:50.948
(Sighs)

11:52.017 --> 11:54.885
Okay, I guess I'm ready to go.

11:54.920 --> 11:56.187
Try not to be too mad at Bay.

11:56.221 --> 11:58.990
I'm sure she feels bad
about all of this too.

11:59.024 --> 12:00.791
I know. I just...

12:00.826 --> 12:02.793
I was really looking forward
to spending time with you.

12:02.828 --> 12:03.928
Me too.

12:03.962 --> 12:06.897
(Sighs) But we can just do next weekend.

12:06.932 --> 12:09.900
And while you're gone I can
catch up on "Breaking Bad"

12:09.935 --> 12:12.770
and count the amount of times
grandma says "I told you so."

12:12.804 --> 12:14.572
Hey.

12:14.606 --> 12:16.440
Why don't you come with us?

12:16.475 --> 12:18.476
- On the retreat?
- Yeah.

12:18.510 --> 12:19.510
Why not?

12:19.544 --> 12:21.078
You can hang out with Melody,

12:21.113 --> 12:22.246
eat s'mores,

12:22.280 --> 12:23.981
avoid grandma.

12:24.016 --> 12:25.383
I do make a mean s'more.

12:25.417 --> 12:27.051
You really do.

12:28.286 --> 12:30.755
You know what? I think
that's a great idea.

12:30.789 --> 12:31.889
I have a doctor's
appointment in the afternoon,

12:31.923 --> 12:33.004
but I can meet you up there.

12:33.025 --> 12:34.825
Are you having more
problems with your hands?

12:34.860 --> 12:36.961
Actually, no.

12:36.995 --> 12:39.864
Um, this is somebody new
and she's run lots of tests

12:39.898 --> 12:42.633
and seems optimistic.
I'm hoping for good news.

12:42.668 --> 12:44.735
- That's so great!
- I know.

12:44.770 --> 12:45.770
Come as soon as you can.

12:45.804 --> 12:47.505
Okay.

12:48.539 --> 12:51.208
<i>Lana: And you didn't
know two weeks ago that</i>

12:51.243 --> 12:52.510
the parts needed to come from Germany?

12:52.544 --> 12:54.245
We hoped we could get them locally.

12:54.279 --> 12:56.347
Well, my insurance won't
cover any more rental car days.

12:56.381 --> 12:57.481
I'm really sorry.

12:57.516 --> 13:00.084
I am a pregnant woman walking eight blocks

13:00.118 --> 13:01.986
to and from the bus stop every day.

13:02.020 --> 13:03.087
My wife has had four kids.

13:03.121 --> 13:05.222
She says exercise is
good for you and the baby.

13:05.257 --> 13:07.024
Helps with the delivery.

13:07.059 --> 13:09.060
Oh, really? Dr. Larry.

13:09.094 --> 13:10.995
Is there any other medical
advice you would like

13:11.029 --> 13:12.830
to give me or my unborn child?

13:12.864 --> 13:15.066
- Hi.
- We are not done here.

13:15.100 --> 13:16.767
No, sorry. Um...

13:16.802 --> 13:19.603
- Don't know if you remember me, but...
- Yeah.

13:19.638 --> 13:21.439
From Angelo's place.

13:21.473 --> 13:23.501
Right. Yeah. Can I help?

13:23.502 --> 13:24.769
I swear her car will be ready tomorrow.

13:24.803 --> 13:26.570
Well, mine's done now. I could give you

13:26.605 --> 13:29.540
a ride home today and bring you
back tomorrow, if that would help.

13:29.574 --> 13:30.508
Tomorrow.

13:30.542 --> 13:32.410
As God as my witness.

13:35.480 --> 13:38.983
Um, okay, I... I really
don't wanna put you out.

13:39.017 --> 13:41.085
You're not.

13:41.119 --> 13:42.119
Okay. Thanks.

13:42.154 --> 13:43.087
Sure.

13:43.088 --> 13:44.688

13:54.639 --> 13:57.730

13:57.731 --> 13:59.331

14:22.928 --> 14:23.861
Noah, right?

14:23.895 --> 14:25.763
No, Jeremy.

14:25.797 --> 14:27.832
(Chuckles)

14:27.866 --> 14:29.707
There better not be
contraband in there, camper.

14:29.735 --> 14:32.536
And if there is? But I'm willing to share.

14:32.571 --> 14:34.438
Ah, I really don't see a problem then.

14:34.473 --> 14:35.673
(Chuckles)

14:35.707 --> 14:37.675
Whoa, how much contraband
have you consumed?

14:37.709 --> 14:39.543
(Exhales)

14:39.578 --> 14:41.712
Noah, whoa! Are you okay?

14:41.780 --> 14:43.447
(Exhales deeply)

14:43.482 --> 14:44.448
I just need a minute.

14:44.483 --> 14:46.484
(Clears throat)

14:46.518 --> 14:48.352
What's going on?

14:50.222 --> 14:52.456
Um...

14:52.491 --> 14:55.292
I have this thing

14:55.327 --> 14:56.494
called Meniere's disease.

14:56.528 --> 14:58.195
(Sniffs)

14:58.230 --> 15:00.431
It messes with my... my
balance and my hearing and stuff.

15:05.303 --> 15:07.037
What do you mean "messes with"?

15:07.072 --> 15:10.174
Uh, I just get dizzy spells.

15:10.208 --> 15:13.144
They last for a few minutes or all day.

15:13.178 --> 15:15.079
<i>I've lost 60% of the
hearing in my right ear.</i>

15:15.113 --> 15:17.815
And eventually...

15:17.849 --> 15:19.483
I could lose it all.

15:19.518 --> 15:22.720
<i>When we went around in
the circle that first day,</i>

15:22.754 --> 15:24.388
I thought you said you were at Carlton

15:24.422 --> 15:25.723
because you had deaf relatives.

15:25.757 --> 15:27.324
Yeah, my Uncle.

15:27.359 --> 15:28.626
He's got Meniere's too.

15:28.660 --> 15:29.693
<i>- (Chuckles)
- Right.</i>

15:29.694 --> 15:32.116
My parents figured that it'd be good

15:32.150 --> 15:34.385
to get a head start on
the whole hand thing.

15:36.221 --> 15:38.322
It's incredible, you know?

15:38.356 --> 15:40.324
One day you're fine, and the next...

15:40.358 --> 15:42.059
whole life changes.

15:45.097 --> 15:46.764
Yeah.

15:46.798 --> 15:48.733
It's crazy how that can happen.

15:49.968 --> 15:51.969
Why didn't you just tell everybody

15:52.003 --> 15:53.738
that you have Meniere's?

15:53.772 --> 15:56.474
I don't really like to talk about it.

15:57.809 --> 16:00.277
Well...

16:00.312 --> 16:03.314
you wanna hear my "your whole
life changes in a day" story?

16:04.483 --> 16:05.516
(Chuckling) You've got one too?

16:05.550 --> 16:07.384
Get comfortable.

16:07.419 --> 16:09.286
<i>(Noah chuckles)</i>

16:09.321 --> 16:13.491
<i>Bay: Um, so we took this blood
test in bio class and, well...</i>

16:17.511 --> 16:20.313
<i>Jane: Welcome. I can see you're
all very excited to be here.</i>

16:20.348 --> 16:23.416
Well, you have been
selected to participate

16:23.451 --> 16:25.452
in this team-building weekend because...

16:25.486 --> 16:28.288
<i>you are either a role model at Carlton,</i>

16:28.322 --> 16:30.323
<i>a troublemaker...</i>

16:30.358 --> 16:32.125
<i>or a target.</i>

16:32.159 --> 16:33.426
<i>Your first assignment</i>

16:33.461 --> 16:35.395
will be to replicate

16:35.429 --> 16:38.331
<i>the object that's under this tarp.</i>

16:38.366 --> 16:40.233
<i>You will be split up
into groups of five...</i>

16:41.802 --> 16:44.804
<i>one looker, two runners</i>

16:44.839 --> 16:46.740
<i>and two builders.</i>

16:47.975 --> 16:49.042
<i>You'll get the hang of it.</i>

16:49.076 --> 16:50.610
<i>Now before you start out,</i>

16:50.645 --> 16:52.846
<i>please remember: You must always sign.</i>

16:54.448 --> 16:55.482
<i>Okay.</i>

16:55.516 --> 16:56.650
First group:

16:56.684 --> 16:59.286
<i>Daphne.</i>

17:00.421 --> 17:02.188
<i>Natalie.</i>

17:02.223 --> 17:03.323
Jane: Bay.

17:05.126 --> 17:06.992
<i>Noah.</i>

17:07.028 --> 17:08.161
<i>And Emmett.</i>

17:12.934 --> 17:15.268
<i>Second group:</i>

17:15.303 --> 17:17.737
<i>Jennifer.</i>

17:17.771 --> 17:19.705
<i>Tony.</i>

17:19.740 --> 17:21.107
<i>Amy.</i>

17:21.142 --> 17:22.709
<i>Howard.</i>

17:22.742 --> 17:24.944
<i>And Liz.</i>

17:24.979 --> 17:26.880
So Kathryn, what do you call this dish?

17:26.914 --> 17:27.847
Just what it is...

17:27.882 --> 17:29.849
pork chops, black beans

17:29.884 --> 17:32.452
- and salsa.
- That is so good!

17:32.486 --> 17:35.422
Now I taste the cinnamon. But what else?

17:35.456 --> 17:38.491
Cumin, a little chili powder, ginger.

17:38.526 --> 17:40.160
It's a rub.

17:40.194 --> 17:42.362
And can you tell our listeners
how you came up with this

17:42.396 --> 17:44.130
delectable combination?

17:45.399 --> 17:47.867
Actually, um...

17:47.902 --> 17:49.803
I got this recipe a long time ago

17:49.837 --> 17:51.104
from this guy who works for John

17:51.138 --> 17:53.673
at the car wash... Hector Gonzales.

17:53.708 --> 17:57.544
I believe it's a variation
on a Guatemalan dish.

17:57.578 --> 17:58.845
- Interesting.
- Yeah.

17:58.879 --> 18:01.815
Hector started out on the
line at John's first car wash.

18:01.849 --> 18:03.350
And when he opened two more,

18:03.384 --> 18:04.651
he promoted him to manager.

18:04.685 --> 18:05.685
He did a great job.

18:05.720 --> 18:07.454
Is that when he gave you this recipe?

18:07.488 --> 18:09.356
I... I...

18:09.390 --> 18:10.390
I don't quite remember.

18:10.424 --> 18:12.125
But it's so great because

18:12.159 --> 18:15.228
John never forgets that we
are a nation of immigrants.

18:15.262 --> 18:17.230
And he believes that we should be finding

18:17.264 --> 18:19.933
legal ways to welcome people

18:19.967 --> 18:22.902
who want to be part of
this great American dream.

18:22.937 --> 18:24.871
Not putting up barriers to push them out.

18:24.905 --> 18:26.673
That is very admirable.

18:27.842 --> 18:30.910
Does your family eat a lot
of Latin-inspired dishes?

18:30.945 --> 18:33.813
We're very inclusive.

18:33.848 --> 18:35.582
We eat all kinds of food.

18:38.586 --> 18:39.552
(Exhales)

18:39.587 --> 18:41.654
So can I burn this thing now?

18:41.689 --> 18:44.391
I'm afraid the news isn't good.

18:44.425 --> 18:46.226
But I'm feeling better.

18:46.260 --> 18:49.195
That's because you haven't been doing
anything to irritate the problem.

18:49.230 --> 18:51.965
Cutting hair, signing, painting.

18:51.999 --> 18:53.233
The M.R.I. shows the beginnings

18:53.267 --> 18:56.069
of osteonecrosis in your wrists.

18:56.103 --> 18:57.937
And that's bad?

18:59.140 --> 19:00.073
It can be.

19:04.812 --> 19:07.013
If you don't make some changes soon,

19:07.048 --> 19:09.682
it'll be hard to turn a doorknob,

19:09.717 --> 19:12.485
hold a hairbrush, drive a car.

19:14.488 --> 19:16.623
Okay, so what do I need
to do to make it better?

19:16.657 --> 19:17.624
At this point,

19:17.658 --> 19:19.459
it's about not making it worse.

19:19.493 --> 19:21.494
(Sighs)

19:21.529 --> 19:23.263
I'll just find someone else.

19:24.298 --> 19:25.398
Regina.

19:26.467 --> 19:28.968
You've seen over a dozen specialists.

19:29.003 --> 19:31.905
At some point it's not about giving up.

19:31.939 --> 19:35.075
It's just simply about
accepting your new reality.

19:38.879 --> 19:40.080
<i>(Pop music playing)</i>

20:22.890 --> 20:24.891
Um, I just wanted to ask, um...

20:24.925 --> 20:26.993
Daphne, uh, for more...

- Oh, uh,

- "information."
- Information. Okay, sorry.

20:48.249 --> 20:51.151
have to run so far if we need

information.

20:52.353 --> 20:53.386
Yes!

20:53.420 --> 20:55.054
Yes, I knew them all.

21:19.513 --> 21:20.446
You and me?

21:20.447 --> 21:21.447
_

21:22.750 --> 21:24.584
Okay. Um, maybe.

21:26.189 --> 21:28.650
_

21:28.656 --> 21:31.224
Because he's my friend.

21:31.258 --> 21:33.238
And he's not feeling well.

21:33.239 --> 21:35.306
_

21:35.396 --> 21:37.130
No no, it's not like that.

21:37.164 --> 21:38.881
Look, it's hard to explain.

21:38.882 --> 21:40.176
_

21:41.102 --> 21:42.702
<i>Noah: I think we know what to do now.</i>

21:48.085 --> 21:49.719
Lana: Does everybody know?

21:49.754 --> 21:51.688
In your family?

21:51.722 --> 21:53.656
Uh, about you and Angelo?

21:53.691 --> 21:55.525
Yeah, kinda.

21:55.559 --> 21:58.528
Ah, but don't worry, we've
all been fooled by Angelo

21:58.562 --> 21:59.796
at some time or another.

22:01.465 --> 22:02.599
He's a charming guy.

22:02.633 --> 22:05.235
I wouldn't really know.

22:05.269 --> 22:06.403
I barely know him.

22:07.471 --> 22:09.239
I don't normally

22:09.273 --> 22:10.194
meet somebody and then...

22:10.207 --> 22:12.242
I mean, I... I... I'm saying

22:12.276 --> 22:14.244
I... I'm not some kind of...

22:14.278 --> 22:18.014
Oh, yeah. I'm sure you're not.

22:20.117 --> 22:23.153
So you're not like ready
to have the baby, are you?

22:23.187 --> 22:25.221
I don't think so.

22:25.256 --> 22:26.823
Good. I didn't pay attention

22:26.857 --> 22:28.892
to those birthing videos in health class,

22:28.926 --> 22:30.026
so I wouldn't be much help.

22:30.061 --> 22:31.661
Well, you don't have to worry.

22:31.695 --> 22:33.930
<i>- I'm a medical student.
- They teach you how to...</i>

22:33.964 --> 22:35.832
deliver your own baby in medical school?

22:35.866 --> 22:37.667
- (Inhaling and exhaling deeply)
- Are you okay?

22:37.701 --> 22:39.002
- Look out!
- Oh!

22:39.036 --> 22:40.570
- (Tires screech)
- (Car crashes)

22:40.604 --> 22:41.571
(Both panting)

22:45.708 --> 22:47.675
- Thanks, man. Sorry.
- Yeah.

22:53.349 --> 22:54.382
Are you sure you're okay?

22:54.416 --> 22:55.416
I'm fine. I just...

22:55.451 --> 22:57.151
I feel terrible about your car.

22:57.186 --> 22:59.354
I mean, if you weren't taking me home...

22:59.388 --> 23:02.957
I could be in a worse
accident on the freeway.

23:02.992 --> 23:03.958
(Moaning) Oh.

23:03.993 --> 23:05.193
(Inhales deeply and exhales)

23:05.194 --> 23:06.961
- Ooh, okay.
- Okay, we're going to the hospital.

23:06.996 --> 23:08.229
No, it's just Braxton-Hicks.

23:08.263 --> 23:09.931
It's... they're practice contractions.

23:09.965 --> 23:11.799
They're perfectly harmless...

23:11.834 --> 23:13.067
(Groans)

23:13.102 --> 23:15.803
I think.

23:15.838 --> 23:17.071
Yep, definitely going to the hospital.

23:17.106 --> 23:18.673
Here we go.

23:18.707 --> 23:19.941
(Groans)

23:19.975 --> 23:23.645
Jane: So how do you all think that went?

23:27.683 --> 23:28.783
<i>Matthew?</i>

23:28.817 --> 23:30.551
How'd it go for you and your group?

23:31.205 --> 23:32.332
_

23:33.154 --> 23:35.619
_

23:35.624 --> 23:37.125
<i>Maybe you should</i>

23:37.159 --> 23:39.093
try talking and see how
good you are at that?

23:39.128 --> 23:40.228
- Bay...
- Whoa whoa!

23:40.229 --> 23:41.997
_

23:42.031 --> 23:44.232
- That's not okay!
- (Overlapping arguing)

23:44.266 --> 23:46.267
<i>- Daphne: You should not be here!
- Noah: Calm down! Hey!</i>

23:46.301 --> 23:47.268
(Indistinct shouting)

23:47.302 --> 23:48.870
<i>Jane: Enough! Enough.</i>

23:50.939 --> 23:53.074
<i>That's what I thought.</i>

24:04.486 --> 24:06.454
<i>I want you to make a list</i>

24:06.488 --> 24:09.390
<i>of all the things that you think you know</i>

24:09.425 --> 24:11.259
<i>about your partner.</i>

24:11.293 --> 24:12.393
<i>And when you're done,
you'll share your insights</i>

24:12.428 --> 24:13.361
<i>with the group.</i>

24:14.530 --> 24:17.065
<i>Sign only. No interpreter.</i>

24:17.099 --> 24:18.299
<i>And remember:</i>

24:18.333 --> 24:21.069
You can't say anything related
to being hearing or deaf.

24:21.103 --> 24:22.804
<i>All right.</i>

24:22.838 --> 24:26.107
<i>Now I'm gonna break you into pairs.</i>

24:26.141 --> 24:27.075
<i>Bay</i>

24:27.109 --> 24:28.042
<i>and Natalie.</i>

24:29.078 --> 24:30.745
<i>Noah</i>

24:30.779 --> 24:33.614
<i>and Matthew.</i>

24:38.587 --> 24:40.788
I do have insurance, I promise.

24:40.823 --> 24:42.657
It's just in my other purse,

24:42.691 --> 24:45.393
which is moronic of me.

24:45.427 --> 24:48.296
Don't worry, we'll figure it out later.

24:48.330 --> 24:49.497
You don't have to stay.

24:49.531 --> 24:52.066
How else are you gonna get home?

24:52.101 --> 24:54.001
I'll figure something out.

24:54.036 --> 24:55.369
Are you sure you don't
want me to call somebody?

24:55.404 --> 24:57.839
<i>Angelo, maybe?</i>

24:57.873 --> 24:59.140
Okay, not Angelo.

24:59.174 --> 25:01.109
Um...

25:01.143 --> 25:02.944
someone from your family? Anybody?

25:04.780 --> 25:07.648
My family lives in Boston.

25:07.683 --> 25:09.751
And they don't even know I'm pregnant.

25:09.785 --> 25:12.453
<i>Nurse: Dr. Kornreich
thinks everything is fine.</i>

25:12.488 --> 25:14.722
But she wanted us to get an
ultrasound just to be sure.

25:16.458 --> 25:18.292
Are you the dad?

25:18.327 --> 25:19.460
Me? No. God, no.

25:19.495 --> 25:21.329
<i>I mean...</i>

25:21.363 --> 25:23.164
well, not because she's...

25:24.233 --> 25:26.033
we've never...

25:26.068 --> 25:27.401
I mean, we're not, you know...

25:27.436 --> 25:30.071
You know, we're just... we're friends.

25:30.105 --> 25:31.973
Yes. (Exhales)

25:32.007 --> 25:34.108
Um, I... I'll give you a minute.

25:34.143 --> 25:36.010
You can stay.

25:36.044 --> 25:38.012
<i>You know,</i>

25:38.046 --> 25:39.180
if you want to.

25:40.783 --> 25:41.983
Okay. Sure.

25:45.921 --> 25:46.888
There she is.

25:48.624 --> 25:50.792
<i>Toby: Wow.</i>

25:50.826 --> 25:53.561
That's incredible.

25:55.631 --> 25:58.599
Yeah. It's pretty amazing.

26:03.005 --> 26:05.907
I try not to look.

26:05.941 --> 26:07.942
It just makes it harder.

26:07.976 --> 26:09.277
Makes what harder?

26:09.311 --> 26:11.145
Giving her up for adoption.

26:14.883 --> 26:16.818
Oh.

26:18.620 --> 26:19.554
(Sighs)

26:23.525 --> 26:25.359
<i>Jane: All right, enough.</i>

26:25.394 --> 26:26.661
<i>Bay</i>

26:26.695 --> 26:28.563
<i>and Natalie, you're up.</i>

26:33.658 --> 26:34.910
_

26:36.271 --> 26:37.405
Look, if I have to...

26:37.406 --> 26:39.051
_

26:39.052 --> 26:42.908
_

26:43.946 --> 26:45.079
Okay. Fine, I'll start.

26:45.113 --> 26:47.849
Um, Natalie Pierce is a bully.

26:47.883 --> 26:49.183
<i>(Pen and paper clatter)</i>

26:52.333 --> 26:54.327
_

26:54.328 --> 26:58.558
_

26:58.894 --> 27:00.862
You don't know anything about me,

27:00.896 --> 27:04.532
but you hate me anyway,
which makes you a bigot

27:04.566 --> 27:05.499
and a bully.

27:05.500 --> 27:08.409
_

27:08.437 --> 27:12.440
Because every hearing person in the world

27:12.474 --> 27:13.441
is the same, right?

27:13.475 --> 27:15.376
We're all out to get you.

27:18.347 --> 27:20.248
<i>Jane: All right, settle down.</i>

27:20.315 --> 27:23.217
<i>Now that you've let off some steam,</i>

27:23.252 --> 27:25.119
try again.

27:25.153 --> 27:28.089
<i>But this time, say something positive</i>

27:28.123 --> 27:29.824
<i>about the other.</i>

27:38.867 --> 27:39.834
Proud.

27:41.904 --> 27:43.504
(Sighs and smacks lips)

27:43.553 --> 27:44.761
_

27:47.442 --> 27:48.542
Tough.

27:50.935 --> 27:52.421
_

27:54.416 --> 27:55.483
Honest.

27:57.670 --> 27:59.350
_

28:02.157 --> 28:03.090
<i>Jane: Excellent!</i>

28:03.125 --> 28:06.127
<i>And not so hard, right?</i>

28:06.161 --> 28:09.096
<i>I think we've all earned our s'mores.</i>

28:17.506 --> 28:19.607
Well, you missed all the fireworks.

28:19.641 --> 28:20.808
I caught a few.

28:20.842 --> 28:21.809
I'm gonna go get some s'mores.

28:21.843 --> 28:23.411
Hey!

28:23.445 --> 28:24.679
You're not wearing your brace.

28:24.713 --> 28:26.547
That means good news, right?

28:26.581 --> 28:28.416
Not exactly.

28:28.450 --> 28:29.617
Oh.

28:31.625 --> 28:34.835
_

28:34.836 --> 28:36.157
(Chuckling)

28:37.188 --> 28:39.887
_

28:40.095 --> 28:42.997
Yeah, did the doctor say
when you'd get better?

28:44.066 --> 28:45.132
She said the same thing

28:45.167 --> 28:46.868
that all the rest of them have said.

28:46.902 --> 28:49.670
That with the combination

28:49.705 --> 28:51.606
of learning to sign as an adult,

28:51.640 --> 28:53.507
the amount of signing that I've done

28:53.542 --> 28:55.710
and the painting and the
years of cutting hair,

28:55.744 --> 28:58.613
the damage is irreparable.

28:58.647 --> 29:00.414
And if I go back to doing what I was,

29:00.449 --> 29:03.251
it'll get worse.

29:03.285 --> 29:05.353
Chronic numbness, pain,

29:05.387 --> 29:07.188
severe arthritis.

29:08.390 --> 29:11.192
What about sign language?

29:15.163 --> 29:16.097
I can't.

29:17.165 --> 29:19.000
Ever?

29:21.069 --> 29:23.070
You can still sign to me.

29:23.105 --> 29:25.640
And I can understand it.

29:25.674 --> 29:26.707
You never know with medicine.

29:26.742 --> 29:28.876
New things are happening all the time.

29:30.846 --> 29:35.483
I... I need to go check on my group.

29:42.145 --> 29:45.050
_

29:45.051 --> 29:48.213
_

29:50.065 --> 29:51.332
Yes.

29:54.403 --> 29:55.336
What?

29:56.884 --> 29:59.936
_

30:00.876 --> 30:01.708
Meaning?

30:01.709 --> 30:06.426
_

30:07.082 --> 30:08.716
You think I'm faking this?

30:08.717 --> 30:11.412
_

30:11.682 --> 30:13.571
_

30:13.572 --> 30:15.913
_

30:15.914 --> 30:18.525
_

30:18.527 --> 30:20.394
If I could, why wouldn't I?

30:20.395 --> 30:21.502
_

30:21.503 --> 30:23.297
_

30:23.654 --> 30:25.912
_

30:26.435 --> 30:28.402
You are not in my body.

30:28.437 --> 30:30.972
You do not know how I feel.

30:31.006 --> 30:33.841
And if you really think that
I am not trying hard enough,

30:33.875 --> 30:36.911
you are most certainly not my friend.

30:51.384 --> 30:54.386
(Exhales and chuckles)

30:54.420 --> 30:56.121
I'm sorry.

30:56.155 --> 30:58.123
I, uh... I haven't figured out

30:58.157 --> 30:59.925
how to do that

30:59.959 --> 31:02.928
without, uh, scaring someone

31:02.962 --> 31:04.930
who can't hear me coming.

31:04.964 --> 31:07.132
It's okay.

31:07.166 --> 31:09.668
Are you okay?

31:09.702 --> 31:11.737
Can I help?

31:11.771 --> 31:16.642
Not unless you're a wizard or a magician.

31:16.676 --> 31:17.843
I don't think so.

31:17.877 --> 31:19.378
But, um,

31:19.412 --> 31:21.680
Harry Potter didn't find out

31:21.714 --> 31:24.383
that he was a wizard until he was like...

31:24.417 --> 31:25.350
15.

31:25.385 --> 31:26.585
So...

31:26.619 --> 31:28.186
there's always a chance.

31:28.221 --> 31:30.122
- 11.
- Hmm?

31:30.156 --> 31:32.357
Harry Potter was 11 when he
found out he was a wizard.

31:32.392 --> 31:33.392
Oh, right.

31:33.426 --> 31:34.426
My bad.

31:39.899 --> 31:44.136
I just found out that my mom
can't sign to me ever again.

31:46.639 --> 31:47.606
She has some

31:47.640 --> 31:50.575
weird physical thing

31:50.610 --> 31:52.644
messing up her hands.

31:55.748 --> 31:57.616
I'm sorry.

31:57.650 --> 32:00.319
You're not deaf. You don't get it.

32:00.353 --> 32:02.554
You have no idea how exhausting it is

32:02.588 --> 32:04.656
to have to read lips all the time.

32:04.691 --> 32:07.459
Imagine you found out that your parents

32:07.493 --> 32:10.362
could never talk to you
with their voice ever again.

32:12.265 --> 32:15.033
You had to sign with them
for the rest of your life.

32:18.004 --> 32:19.271
I'm imagining.

32:24.010 --> 32:26.011
If it you makes you, um,

32:26.045 --> 32:29.848
feel any better...

32:31.818 --> 32:35.520
she's probably a million
times madder than you are.

32:38.491 --> 32:41.360
It sucks to feel like
your body's betraying you.

32:48.000 --> 32:51.236
I'll see you back at camp.

32:51.270 --> 32:54.139
<i>- (Soft pop music playing)

33:23.269 --> 33:25.070
The only non-food thing

33:25.104 --> 33:27.372
I said was that you
believe that new immigrants

33:27.407 --> 33:29.141
should get a shot at the American dream.

33:29.175 --> 33:30.175
Is that so bad?

33:30.209 --> 33:31.376
Apparently Sawyer is
already spinning it...

33:31.411 --> 33:33.945
saying that I encourage
illegal immigration.

33:33.980 --> 33:35.180
But that's absurd. Hector's legal.

33:35.214 --> 33:36.748
All your guys are legal.

33:36.783 --> 33:37.749
But you didn't say that.

33:37.784 --> 33:39.151
(Scoffs)

33:39.185 --> 33:41.887
Fine, we'll go the press
tomorrow with the facts.

33:41.921 --> 33:43.889
No, the point is that it
is easy to make mistakes.

33:43.923 --> 33:46.658
That is why Ivan wants to
keep the message general.

33:46.692 --> 33:49.561
You know, we don't want to waste
time going on the defensive,

33:49.595 --> 33:50.695
doing damage control.

33:50.730 --> 33:52.464
So that's how you wanna win this thing?

33:52.498 --> 33:54.566
By saying nothing of substance?

33:54.600 --> 33:58.603
I have spent a lot of my life

33:58.638 --> 34:00.539
thinking I was just a dumb jock.

34:00.573 --> 34:01.573
That is your father talking.

34:01.607 --> 34:03.408
But if I am elected,

34:03.443 --> 34:05.410
I can really do something meaningful.

34:05.445 --> 34:09.347
I can make a difference in
how our kids are educated,

34:09.382 --> 34:11.248
in whether or not people get jobs,

34:11.284 --> 34:14.786
can own their own homes.
But I can't do that

34:14.821 --> 34:16.087
if I don't win.

34:16.121 --> 34:19.056
Then tell people your ideas.

34:19.091 --> 34:21.092
<i>Let them vote for something.</i>

34:21.127 --> 34:23.027
I'm sorry,

34:23.062 --> 34:25.764
but I think Ivan is right.

34:25.797 --> 34:27.632
If you're in the stronger position,

34:27.667 --> 34:29.634
you don't get aggressive,

34:29.668 --> 34:31.570
you hold steady and you let the other team

34:31.603 --> 34:32.571
make the mistakes.

34:34.373 --> 34:36.608
No more talking politics.

34:38.344 --> 34:40.277
Fine.

34:40.313 --> 34:42.214
Then consider your wife reigned in.

34:46.518 --> 34:50.222
Noah: (Off-key) * as the sun shines on

34:50.255 --> 34:52.991
♪ my face

34:53.025 --> 34:55.025
♪ it's true...

34:55.061 --> 34:56.895
Whoa! (Chuckles)

34:58.097 --> 35:00.065
Wow, payback's a bitch.

35:00.099 --> 35:01.199
Payback?

35:01.234 --> 35:03.802
Yeah, I snuck up on somebody earlier.

35:04.871 --> 35:06.638
(Chuckling) Never mind.

35:06.672 --> 35:07.639
How'd you find me here?

35:07.673 --> 35:09.508
Used my superpowers.

35:09.542 --> 35:11.610
I heard the singing. Don't tell anyone.

35:11.644 --> 35:12.777
Oh.

35:12.812 --> 35:14.513
Well, with my A.S.L. skills,

35:14.547 --> 35:15.680
I don't think you have to worry about me

35:15.715 --> 35:16.781
telling anybody anything.

35:16.816 --> 35:18.783
True.

35:18.818 --> 35:21.653
I just wanted some space.

35:21.687 --> 35:24.207
And I think your boyfriend wanted
to see a little less of me too.

35:24.724 --> 35:26.358
Come on.

35:26.392 --> 35:27.492
He was giving me the stink eye all day.

35:27.527 --> 35:28.567
I kind of put it together.

35:30.162 --> 35:31.496
Emmett's not my boyfriend.

35:33.299 --> 35:35.100
He was.

35:37.103 --> 35:39.037
What are you listening to anyway?

35:43.209 --> 35:44.743
Mm.

35:44.777 --> 35:46.077
Nice playlist.

35:46.112 --> 35:47.612
<i>Yeah.</i>

35:47.647 --> 35:49.881
I'm trying to commit them all to memory.

35:49.916 --> 35:51.783
You know, for when the...

35:51.817 --> 35:54.486
(Sighs)

35:54.520 --> 35:56.688
yeah, it sucks 'cause I really love music.

35:56.722 --> 35:58.490
So do Emmett and Daphne.

35:59.625 --> 36:02.294
Emmett's even in my brother's band.

36:02.328 --> 36:03.328
Seriously?

36:03.362 --> 36:05.130
Yeah.

36:05.164 --> 36:06.264
Am I an idiot?

36:06.299 --> 36:08.066
'Cause I don't really get that.

36:08.100 --> 36:10.435
I'm just saying going deaf may
not be what you think it is.

36:13.239 --> 36:14.372
I hope not.

36:17.843 --> 36:19.077
You wanna listen to something?

36:19.111 --> 36:22.213
Ooh, no signing and listening to music?

36:22.248 --> 36:23.848
Dangerous stuff.

36:23.883 --> 36:25.183
Living on the wild side here at

36:25.217 --> 36:27.297
<i>- the Carlton deaf school retreat.
- (Music playing)</i>

36:29.989 --> 36:32.958
<i>* I'm feeling your heart in mine *</i>

36:32.992 --> 36:33.692
<i>* ooh, yeah.</i>

36:40.482 --> 36:42.016
Poison Ivy.

36:42.050 --> 36:43.350
Yeah, uh,

36:43.385 --> 36:44.952
I got it too.

36:44.986 --> 36:46.153
Here.

36:46.188 --> 36:49.190
This stuff is like magic.

36:54.763 --> 36:56.764
Look, um, I really don't

36:56.798 --> 36:57.965
wanna go on another retreat.

36:58.751 --> 37:01.658
_

37:01.770 --> 37:02.837
Okay.

37:02.871 --> 37:05.606
So why don't we call a truce?

37:05.674 --> 37:09.810
The other kids can follow our example.

37:09.845 --> 37:11.545
No more retreats.

37:18.042 --> 37:18.970
_

37:19.354 --> 37:21.121
No problem.

37:31.166 --> 37:34.201
Okay, the car's coming around, so, uh...

37:34.236 --> 37:36.971
thanks for the ride.

37:37.005 --> 37:38.005
No problem.

37:38.039 --> 37:39.940
Hey, I can't stop thinking about

37:39.975 --> 37:41.842
what you said last night at the hospital.

37:41.877 --> 37:43.711
About putting the baby up for adoption

37:43.778 --> 37:45.679
and not having the family around.

37:45.714 --> 37:47.882
I shouldn't have even mentioned that.

37:47.916 --> 37:49.950
It's really not your problem.

37:49.985 --> 37:51.552
Oh, I know. It's just...

37:51.586 --> 37:52.987
the baby does have a family around.

37:53.021 --> 37:55.422
Other than Angelo.

37:55.457 --> 37:56.557
My sister.

37:56.591 --> 37:58.525
Her sister.

37:59.694 --> 38:01.362
Right.

38:01.396 --> 38:02.496
Bay.

38:02.530 --> 38:03.597
Yeah.

38:03.632 --> 38:06.267
I just thought maybe
you might wanna meet her

38:06.301 --> 38:10.371
and our family before you
make any final decisions.

38:12.007 --> 38:13.173
But that's it. That's all I had to say.

38:13.208 --> 38:15.075
So...

38:15.110 --> 38:16.043
I'll see you around.

38:16.077 --> 38:17.144
Okay.

38:29.724 --> 38:31.959
<i>(Door closes)</i>

38:45.473 --> 38:46.540
What are you doing?

38:46.574 --> 38:50.411
Checking out the city
college class catalog.

38:50.445 --> 38:52.446
Trying to figure out
what to do with myself

38:52.480 --> 38:55.382
now that I'm no longer a hairdresser.

38:55.417 --> 38:59.153
Maybe you should run for office like John.

38:59.187 --> 39:02.022
Don't think diplomacy is my strong suit.

39:02.057 --> 39:04.124
You think his is?

39:04.159 --> 39:06.126
(Light chuckle)

39:08.830 --> 39:11.198
Phlebotomist?

39:11.232 --> 39:16.570
Well, I don't love
needles or blood, but...

39:16.604 --> 39:17.805
I can learn. I'm tough.

39:18.807 --> 39:20.407
You are.

39:25.447 --> 39:29.516
I've been doing hair
since I was 19 years old.

39:29.551 --> 39:32.419
I was just a little older than you.

39:32.454 --> 39:34.355
I don't know what's next for me.

39:34.389 --> 39:36.156
I... I really don't.

39:43.898 --> 39:47.101
I do know what it means
not to be able to sign.

39:51.606 --> 39:52.773
You know I do.

39:55.944 --> 39:57.611
I... (Sighs)

39:57.645 --> 39:59.565
I have to figure out a
whole new life for myself.

40:00.648 --> 40:02.750
Everything I thought I had I...

40:04.719 --> 40:06.487
you never know how much
you depend on these things,

40:06.521 --> 40:08.155
huh?

40:14.029 --> 40:15.295
(Quietly) I'm sorry.

40:17.932 --> 40:18.966
I really am.

40:20.035 --> 40:21.835
I know.

40:27.809 --> 40:29.843
Hey. Okay, so,

40:29.878 --> 40:32.880
Natalie and I have called a truce

40:32.914 --> 40:36.050
which means no more retreats.

40:38.063 --> 40:40.352
_

40:41.856 --> 40:43.690
What's wrong?

40:44.530 --> 40:47.295
_

40:49.664 --> 40:53.467
Noah and I are just friends.

40:54.726 --> 40:56.067

No.

41:13.642 --> 41:15.782
_

41:16.991 --> 41:18.725
Well, I know it must seem like that,

41:18.760 --> 41:19.960
but I really didn't.

41:19.961 --> 41:21.196
_

41:22.145 --> 41:24.153
_

41:25.767 --> 41:27.868
Emmett, my head is spinning.

41:27.902 --> 41:29.670
I... (Sighs)

41:29.704 --> 41:31.905
I just started this new school.

41:31.940 --> 41:34.675
I'm barely keeping up in classes.

41:34.709 --> 41:37.311
I mean, half the kids here hate me.

41:37.345 --> 41:38.027
I'm... I'm under water.

41:38.730 --> 41:39.713

41:40.815 --> 41:42.616
<i>- Well, then help me.
