00:19.269 --> 00:21.521
If there's alien life,
do you think they'll be friendly?

00:21.604 --> 00:23.732
-You think they'll like humans?
-I don't know, Brad.

00:23.815 --> 00:26.026
My wife was abducted by aliens
on a business trip

00:26.109 --> 00:27.569
and forced to have sex with her boss.

00:27.652 --> 00:28.737
I know, Brad.

00:28.820 --> 00:30.196
Morning, everyone.

00:30.280 --> 00:34.951
I am about to receive specific information
as to our role in the Europa mission.

00:35.035 --> 00:38.997
Ladies and gentlemen,
we are back in the game!

00:39.080 --> 00:40.790
-Whoo! Yes.

00:40.874 --> 00:43.334
General, you don't know
how much this means to me.

00:43.418 --> 00:46.004
Europa has <i>always</i> been
my favorite moon of Jupiter.

00:46.087 --> 00:47.964
We might just find some alien life!

00:48.048 --> 00:49.716
God, I hope
the Drake Equation is accurate.

00:49.799 --> 00:51.593
Oh my God,
I hope the aliens like Drake too.

00:51.676 --> 00:53.595
-Shh, shh, shh. Here we go.

00:54.137 --> 00:55.388
Mr. Secretary.

00:55.472 --> 00:57.766
<i>Well, Naird, you pushed and you pushed</i>

00:57.849 --> 01:02.312
<i>and called in every favor</i>
<i>you have left in Washington, and…</i>

01:04.731 --> 01:05.857
Hmm?

01:05.940 --> 01:06.775
Yes?

01:07.567 --> 01:08.443
<i>You got it.</i>

01:09.027 --> 01:11.321
<i>I'm sorry. I wasn't trying to be dramatic.</i>

01:11.404 --> 01:12.781
<i>I was swallowing my mint.</i>

01:12.864 --> 01:15.241
<i>You guys got a piece</i>
<i>of the Europa project.</i>

01:15.325 --> 01:16.201
That's great!

01:16.284 --> 01:19.412
That is great news, Mr. Secretary.

01:19.496 --> 01:21.956
I would like to share this
with my team.

01:22.040 --> 01:23.708
I'm going to put you up on the big screen.

01:23.792 --> 01:26.377
<i>Wait. Are you sure you wanna</i>
<i>do this in front of the whole staff?</i>

01:26.461 --> 01:28.463
<i>Okay. Hi, everyone.</i>

01:28.546 --> 01:33.593
<i>Well, actually, NASA will be handling</i>
<i>the majority of the Europa project.</i>

01:33.676 --> 01:35.011
-Really?
-What?

01:35.095 --> 01:38.181
<i>You guys had no role at all</i>
<i>until Congressman Bob White of Oklahoma</i>

01:38.264 --> 01:39.474
<i>got you included.</i>

01:39.557 --> 01:42.393
<i>He's been in Congress</i>
<i>since the beginning of the space program.</i>

01:42.477 --> 01:45.063
Oh my God. That was 1952.

01:45.146 --> 01:47.816
God bless Bob White.
He's been our staunchest defender.

01:47.899 --> 01:49.526
He's 103 years old.

01:49.609 --> 01:50.652
He's a spry 103.

01:50.735 --> 01:52.362
<i>Your job will be to prepare</i>

01:52.445 --> 01:55.490
<i>an in-depth PowerPoint presentation</i>
<i>on astronaut defense.</i>

01:55.573 --> 01:56.825
PowerPoint?

01:56.908 --> 01:58.993
Defense against whom?

01:59.077 --> 02:00.954
This is an international effort

02:01.037 --> 02:04.082
involving practically
every country on Earth.

02:04.165 --> 02:07.127
<i>Defense against any life forms</i>
<i>we might encounter.</i>

02:07.210 --> 02:09.462
<i>We need our crews</i>
<i>to be prepared to kill 'em.</i>

02:09.546 --> 02:11.506
<i>Okay, I can't see your faces,</i>

02:11.589 --> 02:15.009
<i>but I'm wagering that you're all</i>
<i>looking pretty pissed right now.</i>

02:15.093 --> 02:19.973
<i>Look, Congressman White is obsessed</i>
<i>with the possibility of alien invasion,</i>

02:20.056 --> 02:22.225
<i>and we're just humoring his wish,</i>

02:22.308 --> 02:24.477
<i>as it may well be his last.</i>

02:24.561 --> 02:28.273
<i>It is extremely unlikely</i>
<i>that you will encounter aliens.</i>

02:28.356 --> 02:31.734
<i>And even more unlikely</i>
<i>that they will be hostile.</i>

02:31.818 --> 02:34.404
<i>But this work can be vital.</i>

02:36.489 --> 02:37.907
<i>Okay. I can't do it.</i>

02:37.991 --> 02:40.076
Are you saying our job
is incredibly important

02:40.160 --> 02:41.578
or incredibly unimportant?

02:41.661 --> 02:42.912
<i>Unimportant, Naird.</i>

02:43.580 --> 02:47.000
<i>But, on the other hand,</i>
<i>for you it's incredibly important</i>

02:47.083 --> 02:50.336
<i>because if you guys</i>
<i>do a bad job, you're fucked.</i>

02:51.754 --> 02:53.882
<i>And that's how you end a phone call.</i>

02:54.382 --> 02:56.759
Okay.

02:56.843 --> 02:59.429
Well, silver lining,

02:59.971 --> 03:00.930
uh…

03:01.014 --> 03:04.017
we are part of the Europa project.

03:04.100 --> 03:07.270
A disgraceful and insignificant part.

03:07.353 --> 03:09.522
Well, Adrian, there are no small jobs.

03:09.606 --> 03:12.025
Yes, there are, and we have the smallest.

03:23.912 --> 03:27.040
Wow. What just happened?

03:27.123 --> 03:29.876
Oh no. I'm sorry.
Was that your first time?

03:29.959 --> 03:32.879
-Well, second time with you, so…
-So it was your second time.

03:32.962 --> 03:35.548
-I mean, three times at least.
-Okay, good.

03:36.216 --> 03:38.384
So what's going on with us?

03:38.468 --> 03:40.470
You know, like, what are we doing?

03:40.553 --> 03:43.598
You just hit me up, out of the blue,
at three o'clock in the morning.

03:44.599 --> 03:47.143
Just trying to figure out,
you know, what this is.

03:47.936 --> 03:48.978
Um…

03:49.646 --> 03:52.190
This is, you know, this.

03:54.359 --> 03:57.737
-Thanks for clearing it up.

03:57.820 --> 03:59.239
Fine. Um…

04:00.573 --> 04:04.577
Okay. This is all I have the bandwidth for
at the moment. How's that?

04:05.745 --> 04:07.288
-Bandwidth?
-Yeah.

04:07.372 --> 04:09.165
Says the nonscientist?

04:10.625 --> 04:11.918
I know what bandwidth means,

04:12.001 --> 04:14.712
but why don't <i>you</i> explain to me
what bandwidth means?

04:14.796 --> 04:16.005
Oh. God.

04:16.089 --> 04:17.340
Hmm… Oh.

04:21.219 --> 04:22.553
-What are you doing?

04:23.429 --> 04:25.098
-Cleaning my apartment.

04:25.181 --> 04:28.601
Yeah, then I might
order some running shoes online,

04:28.685 --> 04:29.769
pay some bills.

04:30.353 --> 04:33.231
-Right now, I'm gonna play the drums.
-At four o'clock in the morning?

04:33.314 --> 04:36.985
It is amazing what you can accomplish when
you eliminate sleep from the equation.

04:37.610 --> 04:39.279
Can we talk about this for a minute?

04:42.198 --> 04:43.074
Angela!

04:44.492 --> 04:46.661
Oh, not again!

04:46.744 --> 04:48.413
Shut up!

04:49.038 --> 04:51.207
"The protection of human life is vital

04:51.291 --> 04:52.834
to the success of the Europa mission."

04:52.917 --> 04:57.171
"In the unlikely but still possible event
of hostile alien contact,

04:57.255 --> 04:58.923
we must be prepared to respond."

04:59.007 --> 05:00.425
I'm gonna stop you right there.

05:00.508 --> 05:02.051
-What?
-Maybe this'll help.

05:02.135 --> 05:05.263
Just tell me what our mission is.
You to me. Just us friends. Go.

05:06.055 --> 05:09.225
To protect our astronauts
from being killed by hostile aliens.

05:09.309 --> 05:11.686
That's incredible.
That. You just nailed it.

05:11.769 --> 05:14.897
Use that for the rest of the speech.
Tell them what you just told me.

05:16.774 --> 05:18.443
-"In the unlikely--"
-You blew it.

05:18.526 --> 05:20.987
-I'm sorry. You can't do that voice.
-What voice?

05:21.070 --> 05:23.114
The "General Naird
is speaking to a group" voice.

05:23.197 --> 05:24.282
What are you talking about?

05:24.365 --> 05:25.575
You have this weird,

05:25.658 --> 05:28.453
almost, like,
manufactured tamber to your voice

05:28.536 --> 05:29.787
when you're speaking to a group.

05:29.871 --> 05:30.788
That is ridiculous.

05:31.622 --> 05:33.666
Yeah. Well, you're right.

05:33.750 --> 05:36.127
Maybe I'm being an idiot.
Give it another shot. Go.

05:38.046 --> 05:42.425
"In the unlikely but still
possible event of hostile alien contact…"

05:42.508 --> 05:43.760
-Okay. I'm gonna…

05:43.843 --> 05:46.387
- <i>That is ridiculous.</i>
-<i>Yeah. Well, you're right.</i>

05:46.471 --> 05:48.765
<i>Maybe I'm being an idiot.</i>
<i>Give it another shot. Go.</i>

05:48.848 --> 05:52.852
<i>"In the unlikely but still</i>
<i>possible event of hostile alien contact--"</i>

05:52.935 --> 05:53.895
Fuck me.

05:54.520 --> 05:57.065
And then these here, uh,
they're in alphabetical order,

05:57.148 --> 06:00.485
so just find the letter, take these off,
put it in, and put it back down there.

06:00.568 --> 06:02.779
Just watch your finger on that.
It's sharp.

06:02.862 --> 06:06.491
All right, this might be
the most important part of my job.

06:08.493 --> 06:09.827
Making my dad coffee?

06:09.911 --> 06:11.579
"Making my dad coffee."

06:11.662 --> 06:13.164
It's a bit more than that, Erin.

06:13.247 --> 06:16.250
It's about keeping him at optimal
caffeination levels throughout the day.

06:16.334 --> 06:18.795
Not jittery, but definitely not lethargic.

06:18.878 --> 06:20.505
-Mmm. Right.
-Yeah.

06:20.588 --> 06:23.091
So he's clear-minded
and can make good decisions.

06:23.174 --> 06:24.634
So he doesn't get mad at me.

06:25.301 --> 06:28.930
Okay, so we take a filter. We unfold it.

06:30.932 --> 06:33.309
She said she doesn't have the bandwidth.

06:33.393 --> 06:36.729
Because how could she say,
"You're just not good enough for me"?

06:36.813 --> 06:37.939
Dude, it's not you.

06:38.022 --> 06:41.567
I always thought it would be amazing
to just be a sexual plaything.

06:41.651 --> 06:43.653
-Who wouldn't want that, right?
-Hmm. Mm-hmm.

06:43.736 --> 06:46.948
But you know what they don't tell you?
It's not that easy.

06:47.031 --> 06:50.118
Have you thought about actually
going to her and telling her how you feel?

06:50.201 --> 06:53.246
I've tried, but…
I'm not good at that stuff.

06:53.329 --> 06:54.705
Oh my God.

06:54.789 --> 06:56.874
Chan, you're an amazing person.

06:56.958 --> 06:59.085
Look at me. Look at me.
You're an amazing person.

06:59.168 --> 07:01.629
When I see you, I see a beautiful Adonis.

07:01.712 --> 07:03.089
I see someone so smart,

07:03.172 --> 07:06.467
I'm afraid of saying words around him
because I'll look stupid.

07:06.551 --> 07:10.847
I see a caring,
sensitive rocket scientist.

07:10.930 --> 07:12.432
That's what I see in front of me now.

07:12.515 --> 07:14.600
You know, when you say it,
I sound pretty desirable.

07:14.684 --> 07:15.560
Well?

07:16.185 --> 07:17.228
Can you tell her that?

07:18.521 --> 07:19.564
You want me to do what?

07:19.647 --> 07:23.067
Tell her I'm amazing, uh, handsome.
Whatever you just said. Tell her.

07:23.151 --> 07:24.694
-You want me to be your hype man?
-Yes!

07:24.777 --> 07:25.903
-No.
-That would be amazing!

07:25.987 --> 07:27.822
I can't.
I tried it a bunch in high school.

07:27.905 --> 07:30.450
It blows up in my face every time.
You do not want this.

07:30.950 --> 07:32.618
I'm sorry. I overreached.

07:32.702 --> 07:33.578
You did.

07:33.661 --> 07:35.955
-That was weird. I made it weird.
-That was crazy.

07:36.038 --> 07:38.332
-You don't have to do it. It's cool.
-Thank you.

07:50.845 --> 07:52.263
That's a lot of nuggets, right?

07:52.889 --> 07:53.973
Don't…

07:56.893 --> 07:58.436
-Okay, I'll do it.
-You will?

07:58.519 --> 07:59.562
-Yeah. I got you.
-Really?

07:59.645 --> 08:00.938
-I got you. I'll do it.

08:01.022 --> 08:02.773
-You mean it?
-God. Yes, I mean it.

08:02.857 --> 08:04.275
Oh my God. You're the best!

08:08.112 --> 08:09.113
Here you go.

08:09.197 --> 08:10.615
Oh, thanks, honey.

08:10.698 --> 08:12.116
Mm-hmm.

08:12.783 --> 08:13.618
How is it?

08:13.701 --> 08:14.785
Mmm.

08:14.869 --> 08:15.828
Good.

08:17.038 --> 08:19.207
Bug, let me ask you something.

08:19.290 --> 08:22.210
Of all the people
that you could have interned with here,

08:22.293 --> 08:24.212
why did you choose Brad?

08:25.129 --> 08:26.130
I don't know.

08:27.298 --> 08:28.174
I mean…

08:30.092 --> 08:32.053
everyone's pretty intimidating here.

08:32.136 --> 08:35.348
Like, they're scientists
and astronauts and soldiers.

08:35.431 --> 08:36.474
Spacemen.

08:36.557 --> 08:38.851
Whatever. Brad seemed like a good start.

08:39.352 --> 08:42.897
Okay? And you always say
that there are no small jobs.

08:42.980 --> 08:45.274
Well, we both know
that that's a bunch of hooey.

08:46.317 --> 08:50.196
Okay, shouldn't we try communicating
with the aliens first before killing them?

08:50.279 --> 08:52.907
Hey, hey.
How's my group of brainiacs doing?

08:52.990 --> 08:54.575
What do you have so far?

08:55.159 --> 08:57.954
Okay. Well, based on this,

08:58.538 --> 09:02.166
we can either shoot 'em
or we can bleach 'em to death.

09:02.792 --> 09:05.753
Okay. I know that none of you
are fans of this mission,

09:05.836 --> 09:07.588
but come on, guys.

09:07.672 --> 09:09.840
We need something
a little bit better than that.

09:09.924 --> 09:14.178
We could bore them to death
with a PowerPoint on how to kill aliens.

09:15.805 --> 09:19.141
Look, sometimes we all have to do things

09:19.225 --> 09:21.519
that we just don't want to do.

09:21.602 --> 09:23.729
Is this a motivational speech?

09:23.813 --> 09:27.233
Adrian, not every job is sexy,
but every job is a job worth doing well.

09:27.316 --> 09:31.654
My dad, he used to say,
"Mark, take the trash out."

09:31.737 --> 09:34.907
"But don't just take it out.
Put it in the trash can."

09:34.991 --> 09:38.411
"And don't just put it in the can.
Shove it to the bottom of the can."

09:38.494 --> 09:41.539
"But don't just do that.
You gotta put the lid on too, Mark."

09:41.622 --> 09:46.502
"And you need to snap the lid tight
to keep the critters out."

09:46.586 --> 09:48.212
He was a wise man.

09:48.296 --> 09:51.215
And he might ask,
"What kind of alien are we talking about?"

09:51.299 --> 09:55.303
"Is it an alien with a hard,
turtle-like shell?"

09:55.386 --> 10:00.099
"And, if so, what caliber bullets
do we use to penetrate that shell?"

10:00.182 --> 10:01.392
Any caliber.

10:01.475 --> 10:04.020
Because turtle shells aren't bulletproof.

10:04.103 --> 10:08.024
Look, look, look, look, look, look,
just… just do me a favor,

10:08.107 --> 10:12.862
and try to come up with some creative ways
to kill something, please.

10:12.945 --> 10:14.614
-Thank you.
-Understood.

10:14.697 --> 10:17.617
I gotta do fuckin' everything myself.

10:23.247 --> 10:25.791
-Can I talk with you in private?
-You can't have my parking spot.

10:25.875 --> 10:27.793
-It's about Chan.
-What happened? Is he okay?

10:27.877 --> 10:30.796
Oh my God. If that worries you,
this is gonna go amazing. Please.

10:31.297 --> 10:32.715
First of all, Chan is fine.

10:32.798 --> 10:35.134
And by that, I mean Chan is doing fine,

10:35.217 --> 10:37.637
but also that boy is <i>fine…</i>

10:37.720 --> 10:39.930
-I don't like that.
-Yeah, of course. Look at this.

10:40.014 --> 10:41.641
-Okay? There he is.
-What?

10:41.724 --> 10:43.267
-Wow!

10:43.351 --> 10:45.478
Hey, did you know that at age ten,

10:45.561 --> 10:48.606
Chan was actually a table tennis champion?

10:48.689 --> 10:50.024
No, I did not know that.

10:50.107 --> 10:53.903
Also, did you know he is incredibly
sensitive and cares about so many people?

10:53.986 --> 10:56.113
Look, if he treats a rat like that,

10:56.197 --> 10:59.158
imagine how he would treat
a romantic partner. That could be you.

10:59.241 --> 11:00.910
Tony, this is stupid.

11:01.410 --> 11:03.412
Did he pay you to do this?
Put you up to it?

11:03.496 --> 11:04.705
-All pro bono.

11:04.789 --> 11:05.956
You know what? I'm surprised.

11:06.040 --> 11:08.668
-I know. He's incredible, right?
-No. You.

11:08.751 --> 11:13.464
Yeah, I always took you for kind of, like,
a, you know, self-absorbed, manipulative,

11:13.547 --> 11:17.009
you know, just soulless
kind of bullshit artist.

11:17.093 --> 11:18.010
Wow.

11:18.636 --> 11:20.554
-It is an art form. Thank you very much.
-Mmm.

11:20.638 --> 11:22.682
So, what do you say?
Put you guys down for a date?

11:22.765 --> 11:26.811
I swear, once you get in front of him,
you'll feel what I'm feeling right now.

11:26.894 --> 11:30.731
No. No, no, no. Just…
I don't know. It's not even Chan.

11:30.815 --> 11:31.941
Let's talk about it then.

11:32.024 --> 11:34.777
-If it's not Chan, then what is it?

11:34.860 --> 11:36.320
I need a drink.

11:37.363 --> 11:38.197
Check this out.

11:38.280 --> 11:41.701
Whoo! A little trick
I learned in high school. Here we go.

11:41.784 --> 11:44.787
Yeah. All right.
What should we toast to?

11:46.664 --> 11:47.498
To Chan.

11:47.581 --> 11:49.959
God, you love Chan.
Maybe you should date him.

11:50.042 --> 11:51.794
Maybe I should.
I got nobody else in my life.

11:52.461 --> 11:54.714
That can't be true.
You know more people than anybody.

11:54.797 --> 11:57.633
Come on. There's gotta be somebody
in this phone worth another look.

11:57.717 --> 11:59.051
-Don't touch my phone.
What?

11:59.135 --> 12:01.637
This is in my pocket all day.
I don't want people looking at it.

12:01.721 --> 12:03.806
I'm not gonna do anything bad.

12:03.889 --> 12:06.308
I've just never had anybody
actually look in my phone before.

12:06.392 --> 12:08.394
Let me… Can I? Please? Just calm down.

12:08.894 --> 12:11.105
Who we got? Who we got? Let's see.

12:11.188 --> 12:14.358
Um, okay. Wait. "Bad Times in Reno."

12:14.442 --> 12:15.317
Mm-hmm.

12:15.401 --> 12:17.153
-"Likes Jazz Too Much."
-Mm-hmm.

12:17.236 --> 12:20.281
Then just two people named
"Ew" and "Uh-Oh." Who are these people?

12:20.364 --> 12:23.534
That is my system. And it's flawless.
I put things in to describe people.

12:23.617 --> 12:25.661
It is way easier than remembering names.

12:25.786 --> 12:26.829
Huh.

12:26.912 --> 12:29.373
-What am I in here as?
-Doesn't matter. Just your name for--

12:29.457 --> 12:30.416
No, let me see.

12:34.462 --> 12:36.964
Well, you are. You are a hero.

12:38.007 --> 12:41.177
Okay, let's just be real.
What's wrong with Chan?

12:41.260 --> 12:45.014
Oh, nothing. No. Chan's great. Truly.

12:45.806 --> 12:47.600
Yeah. I really like hanging out with him.

12:47.683 --> 12:52.563
I'm just, like, not ready
for a full-time thing, you know?

12:53.147 --> 12:55.107
And if he's sending in
a professional wingman,

12:55.191 --> 12:56.484
it is clear he's lost his mind.

12:56.567 --> 12:58.569
He's definitely ready
for a full-time thing,

12:58.652 --> 13:00.696
so if you're not ready for a relationship…

13:00.780 --> 13:02.114
No.

13:02.865 --> 13:05.034
Know what? I don't think
you should be sleeping together.

13:06.035 --> 13:08.746
I mean, he is a precious,
delicate little bird.

13:10.372 --> 13:11.373
Yeah.

13:11.999 --> 13:15.920
No. Yeah, you're totally right.
Um, and I don't need this noise anyway.

13:16.003 --> 13:18.088
So, no more Chan.

13:18.672 --> 13:19.590
Good.

13:20.257 --> 13:23.928
-Can you tell him for me? Hmm?
-No. You want me to tell him?

13:24.011 --> 13:25.429
-Yeah.
-I don't wanna tell him.

13:25.513 --> 13:30.351
Dr. Chan, I want you to look at something,
please, on my computer.

13:30.893 --> 13:33.854
I just want your scientific opinion.

13:33.938 --> 13:35.648
Is this anything?

13:35.731 --> 13:38.984
This species of bacteria

13:39.068 --> 13:41.195
is exhibiting very unusual behavior.

13:41.278 --> 13:45.032
I just want you, just…
for a moment, just watch it closely

13:45.115 --> 13:48.202
and see if… if it shows any signs of…

13:48.285 --> 13:49.620
-Whoa! Jesus!

13:49.703 --> 13:50.663
Shit!

13:50.746 --> 13:51.956
Got you, bitches!

13:52.039 --> 13:53.666
-Got you!

13:53.749 --> 13:57.086
That's how it was done at MIT in the '70s.

13:57.169 --> 13:59.255
Basic, yet effective.

13:59.338 --> 14:00.631
Whoo! That was a nice one.

14:00.714 --> 14:02.967
A morale booster,
free of charge.

14:03.050 --> 14:04.218
You are welcome.

14:04.301 --> 14:06.470
-God.
-Let the games commence.

14:41.088 --> 14:42.673
Oh! Jeez, no!

15:27.635 --> 15:28.761
Ooh.

15:34.099 --> 15:36.769
To drop… snip.

15:47.112 --> 15:50.199
<i>-Making any progress on that PowerPoint?</i>
-Thanks, hon.

15:50.783 --> 15:54.286
Yes, sir. Yes, sir. We have
our best people working on it right now.

15:54.828 --> 15:56.163
Wha-- Gah!

15:56.956 --> 16:00.542
<i>What's going on there, Naird?</i>
<i>Is that a Mentos IED?</i>

16:00.626 --> 16:05.422
-Mr. Secretary, I have to call you back.
-<i>You are a mess, Naird. An absolute mess.</i>

16:12.680 --> 16:14.014
Who's responsible for this?

16:14.098 --> 16:15.057
Hmm?

16:16.183 --> 16:20.104
Mark, I don't think
you understand the creative process.

16:20.187 --> 16:23.107
Play is essential to the inventive mind.

16:23.190 --> 16:25.776
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
You don't understand.

16:25.859 --> 16:30.406
There's a big difference
between creativity and screw-arounds.

16:30.489 --> 16:35.536
A screw-around is how people who work
at government agencies lose their jobs

16:35.619 --> 16:40.290
and how government agencies
get folded into other government agencies.

16:40.374 --> 16:42.334
I just thought it was funny.

16:42.418 --> 16:43.502
Funny?

16:44.420 --> 16:46.255
You know what I think is funny?

16:46.839 --> 16:51.176
Someone who gets ice cream on their chin
and doesn't know about it.

16:51.260 --> 16:55.014
Animals riding on other animals!

16:55.097 --> 16:56.640
Goofy faces!

16:57.850 --> 16:59.977
Somebody getting hit in the crotch!

17:00.060 --> 17:03.731
A dog walking around in pants!

17:03.814 --> 17:06.942
Or a dog trying to eat peanut butter!

17:07.026 --> 17:08.068
That is humor!

17:09.403 --> 17:11.321
Dad, it was just a silly prank.

17:11.905 --> 17:13.323
Yeah, on me.

17:14.158 --> 17:16.285
And on the United States of America.

17:19.580 --> 17:20.706
Yikes.

17:20.789 --> 17:22.958
He sounds genuinely hurt.

17:23.042 --> 17:24.585
Yeah, I think we took it too far.

17:24.668 --> 17:28.088
Maybe we buckle down and power through
that murder Martian manual.

17:28.172 --> 17:29.798
No more screw-arounds.

17:37.473 --> 17:41.268
Dr. Mallory. Uh, you can leave that here.
He doesn't want to be disturbed.

17:41.810 --> 17:43.812
-Still miffed, is he?
-Mm-hmm.

17:44.521 --> 17:46.565
PowerPoint complete.

17:52.112 --> 17:53.238
Here you go, boss.

18:05.292 --> 18:06.835
Hmm. Pretty good.

18:20.599 --> 18:22.726
Interning for Brad?

18:22.810 --> 18:25.604
That's an heroic but reckless choice.

18:25.687 --> 18:28.315
So what did your dad think
of the PowerPoint?

18:28.398 --> 18:29.441
Are we all good now?

18:29.525 --> 18:32.069
Oh, that. Uh, he didn't finish.

18:32.152 --> 18:35.823
Yeah, he came out upset.
Said he was going to subbasement six.

18:35.906 --> 18:38.283
Subbasement six? What's down there?

18:38.367 --> 18:39.618
Wh-- Uh…

18:39.701 --> 18:42.121
-No idea.
-Is that where he goes to sulk?

18:42.204 --> 18:44.498
Why would I know that?
It's my first day. I'm an intern.

18:44.581 --> 18:45.791
But is he okay?

18:45.874 --> 18:47.709
He seemed pretty upset about something.

18:47.793 --> 18:50.254
I… I don't know.
He didn't wanna talk about it.

19:07.771 --> 19:10.899
-How'd you get that?
-Uh, took it out of my dad's drawer.

19:12.025 --> 19:13.152
SB6.

19:13.235 --> 19:14.695
Huh. Who knew?

19:15.445 --> 19:17.739
So, who is gonna lead the apology?

19:17.823 --> 19:19.825
Hmm, I would think that's my job.

19:30.210 --> 19:31.420
What the fuck?

19:38.218 --> 19:40.179
What is that under the sheet?

19:40.262 --> 19:41.763
No idea.

19:43.348 --> 19:46.351
-Is that a webbed hand?

19:47.644 --> 19:49.396
-Clear.
-My God.

19:49.479 --> 19:50.814
-Oh, it's moving.

19:51.982 --> 19:53.192
Oh.

19:54.818 --> 19:56.695
-Oh! Oh God!
-Mark, watch out!

19:58.947 --> 20:01.575
No! No, no!

20:01.658 --> 20:03.744
-No!
-Mark! Mark, strike him!

20:14.087 --> 20:15.797
You motherfuckers.

20:17.257 --> 20:20.344
We got you! We got you so good.

20:20.427 --> 20:22.095
Well done. Bravo.

20:23.513 --> 20:25.474
-Should've seen your faces!
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

20:25.557 --> 20:26.725
You were in on this too?

20:26.808 --> 20:28.227
-Duh.

20:28.310 --> 20:29.811
-Did you buy that?
-We bought it.

20:29.895 --> 20:32.147
I tried to start it subtly
and let the tension build.

20:32.231 --> 20:33.815
-Ooh.

20:36.902 --> 20:40.572
See, Angela is an adventurous woman
and a free spirit.

20:40.656 --> 20:42.908
And, of course, she's a hero.

20:44.201 --> 20:46.453
-And heroes have a lot on their plate.

20:46.536 --> 20:49.248
I know. I already like her.
Why are you showing me all this?

20:49.331 --> 20:52.584
Yeah. Okay. You know how you asked me
to go talk to her about you guys?

20:52.668 --> 20:54.419
-Yeah. And?
-Okay, I did.

20:54.503 --> 20:58.799
We decided that maybe now
is not the best time for you guys to date.

20:58.882 --> 21:03.470
What? I asked you to be my wingman.
This is how you help?

21:03.553 --> 21:06.556
I am helping you. I care about you.
I don't wanna see you get hurt. Okay?

21:06.640 --> 21:07.933
So here's my pitch.

21:08.976 --> 21:09.851
It's over.

21:10.936 --> 21:11.812
What?

21:13.522 --> 21:16.316
Are you breaking up with me for her?

21:16.400 --> 21:18.777
Yes, but it's not you. It's her.

21:19.528 --> 21:22.030
-Is she seeing someone else?
-Of course not. Of course not.

21:22.114 --> 21:23.532
She would never do that to you.

21:25.200 --> 21:27.911
-Then what is it?
-She can't be in a relationship right now.

21:27.995 --> 21:30.539
I don't have to be
in a relationship at all.

21:30.622 --> 21:32.416
-I'm cool with whatever.
-Chan. Chan.

21:32.499 --> 21:34.376
Go tell her that. I'm cool. I'm chill.

21:34.459 --> 21:37.838
Chan, are you really cool with
you guys not being in a relationship?

21:37.921 --> 21:39.881
And just hooking up
like you've been doing?

21:41.341 --> 21:43.677
You okay? Do you wanna get some yogurt?

21:43.760 --> 21:45.429
-Yeah.
-Come on. You're a big boy.

21:45.512 --> 21:47.222
Come on. Let's get a big boy yogurt.

21:47.306 --> 21:49.057
-Hey, you're gonna be all right.

21:49.891 --> 21:52.185
-Credit where credit is due.

21:52.269 --> 21:54.771
That was an excellent prank.

21:55.480 --> 21:57.107
Utterly convincing, really.

21:57.190 --> 21:58.692
I can be a fun guy.

21:59.651 --> 22:02.070
Oh, and you were right.

22:02.154 --> 22:05.741
Sometimes a team
just needs a little screw-around.

22:05.824 --> 22:06.742
So thank you.

22:07.284 --> 22:08.160
Thank you.

22:13.707 --> 22:15.625
-Who did this?
-Did what?

22:15.709 --> 22:18.086
Oh, that is beautiful. Who did that?

22:19.254 --> 22:20.756
-Attention, everyone.

22:20.839 --> 22:23.592
I'd like to let you know
that I just received…

22:23.675 --> 22:25.427
…<i>my divorce papers.</i>

22:25.510 --> 22:27.012
<i>And I am devastated</i>

22:27.095 --> 22:30.640
<i>because, apparently</i>,
<i>my wife is leaving me,</i>

22:30.724 --> 22:31.975
and our marriage is over.

22:33.310 --> 22:36.521
-Mark…
-I'm about to be a single dad. Oh no!

22:37.856 --> 22:39.566
What am I gonna do?

22:39.649 --> 22:40.525
Ha!

22:40.609 --> 22:43.528
<i> I'm going to die alone.</i>

22:44.821 --> 22:49.242
<i>So</i>,<i> kudos to everyone out there</i>
<i>for your excellent work.</i>

22:49.326 --> 22:53.663
Let me see that.
Let me see those devils' handiwork.

22:53.747 --> 22:55.582
Look at that.

22:55.665 --> 22:56.708
Wow.

22:57.292 --> 22:59.252
The attention to detail is…

23:01.880 --> 23:02.839
Well…

23:05.092 --> 23:07.761
The Colorado seal is…

23:09.388 --> 23:10.722
quite accurate.

23:12.682 --> 23:14.059
Looks very real.

23:20.399 --> 23:21.441
Oh…

23:26.238 --> 23:27.364
<i>Oh my God.</i>

23:27.447 --> 23:29.241
<i>Oh my God, Adrian!</i>

23:29.324 --> 23:31.451
<i>Oh God!</i>

23:31.535 --> 23:33.870
<i>It's happening! It's happening!</i>

23:34.871 --> 23:38.542
Oh God, what am I gonna do?
What am I gonna do?
