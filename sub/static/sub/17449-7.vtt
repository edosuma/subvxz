WEBVTT

00:00.542 --> 00:01.875
(Man) Previously on Mighty Med.

00:01.959 --> 00:04.583
-The Legendary Hapax the Elder.
-(Oliver) He's on Caldera.

00:04.667 --> 00:08.125
-(Kaz) Borrow the wormhole transporter?
-(Oliver) We're on planet Caldera.

00:08.208 --> 00:11.542
You're our only hope
to save Skylar and the earth.

00:11.625 --> 00:14.375
(Alan) I will come back
and help you defeat the Annihilator.

00:16.834 --> 00:19.125
(suspense music playing)

00:20.375 --> 00:21.667
(Kaz) Skylar?

00:21.750 --> 00:24.166
(Oliver) The Annihilator,
what are you guys doing here?

00:24.250 --> 00:26.417
We knew you'd come
to find Hapax the Elder.

00:26.500 --> 00:28.583
The only person who can stop
the Annihilator.

00:28.667 --> 00:30.875
(Annihilator) Hapax the Elder
is the last obstacle

00:30.959 --> 00:32.667
keeping me from destroying
the world.

00:32.750 --> 00:34.500
So he must be destroyed.

00:34.583 --> 00:38.542
-(suspense music)
-(Annihilator) Wait a second.

00:38.625 --> 00:40.333
Why is Oliver here,

00:40.417 --> 00:43.083
you told me you finished him off
at the dance?

00:43.166 --> 00:44.417
I did.

00:44.500 --> 00:45.583
I watched him die.

00:45.667 --> 00:48.250
I mean, he was all like,
"Ah, I'm dying."

00:48.333 --> 00:51.917
And I was all like,
"Ha, you're dead."

00:52.000 --> 00:53.458
Hmm, this must be the work

00:53.542 --> 00:56.667
of the Legendary Healer
of Superheroes, Caduceo.

00:56.750 --> 01:00.333
He must have come out of hiding
to bring Oliver back to life.

01:00.417 --> 01:03.667
I was thinking the same thing.

01:03.750 --> 01:05.625
Caduceo will pay for this.

01:05.709 --> 01:07.417
I'll have my minions
track him down

01:07.500 --> 01:09.041
and finish him off for good.

01:09.125 --> 01:11.792
Then no one will be able
to resurrect Kaz and Oliver

01:11.875 --> 01:13.333
once I'm done with them.

01:13.417 --> 01:15.250
I found my favorite sweater.

01:15.333 --> 01:16.917
My granddaughter
bought it for me.

01:17.000 --> 01:20.625
(laughs)

01:20.709 --> 01:23.125
Neil?

01:23.208 --> 01:25.375
Quick, take cover.

01:27.166 --> 01:29.250
Hello, my old student.

01:29.333 --> 01:31.792
I wish I could say
it's good to see you again.

01:31.875 --> 01:33.250
Hapax the Elder.

01:33.333 --> 01:34.792
You look so old.

01:34.875 --> 01:37.250
Your gray hair has turned black.

01:37.333 --> 01:39.208
(Alan) I tried dyeing it gray
for awhile,

01:39.291 --> 01:42.208
but who was I kidding?

01:42.291 --> 01:43.750
I could easily destroy you

01:43.834 --> 01:46.333
with the help of Skylar
or my cannon.

01:46.417 --> 01:48.375
But I'd rather fight you
mano a mano

01:48.458 --> 01:51.375
or should I say,
mutant to mutant.

01:51.458 --> 01:55.417
You shouldn't.
"Mano and mano" sounds much better.

01:55.500 --> 02:00.583
(suspense music)

02:10.583 --> 02:12.250
What are you doing?

02:12.333 --> 02:14.500
Well, when Ambrose draws
this battle for the comic book,

02:14.583 --> 02:17.917
I want to make sure I don't have a weird,
scared expression on my face.

02:19.500 --> 02:20.917
Like that.

02:21.000 --> 02:22.125
(laughs)

02:22.208 --> 02:23.667

(Annihilator) You taught me
every skill I know,

03:11.208 --> 03:14.125
and now those skills
will be your undoing.

03:14.208 --> 03:16.625
You may have learned
how to use those skills,

03:16.709 --> 03:19.583
but not why to use them, Neil.

03:19.667 --> 03:22.208
Stop calling me Neil.

03:22.291 --> 03:25.208
(grunting and straining)

03:43.500 --> 03:45.709
The power cannon.

03:45.792 --> 03:49.875
Skylar, you can give yourself up
or I'll destroy the Annihilator.

03:49.959 --> 03:52.542
You know what,
I'll save you the trouble.

03:59.375 --> 04:00.875
You killed him.

04:00.959 --> 04:02.500
I knew you weren't evil.

04:02.583 --> 04:04.625
These past few weeks
have all been a scheme

04:04.709 --> 04:06.500
to get revenge
on The Annihilator.

04:06.583 --> 04:09.583
Kaz, you owe me a pudding cup.

04:09.667 --> 04:11.250
Oh, I'm still evil.

04:14.750 --> 04:16.208
I was just sick of that guy.

04:16.291 --> 04:19.792
It's always "Annihilate this,
annihilate that."

04:19.875 --> 04:21.417
And why settle for destroying Earth

04:21.500 --> 04:24.125
when I'm powerful enough
to rule the entire universe?

04:26.917 --> 04:30.083
Now who owes who a pudding cup?

04:30.166 --> 04:31.625
Please don't destroy us.

04:31.709 --> 04:34.750
Come on, how can you
even think I'd do that?

04:34.834 --> 04:37.000
You guys are my friends.

04:37.083 --> 04:39.792
Which is why I'm going to let
you live, and turn you evil.

04:39.875 --> 04:42.500
Dang it. I "phewed" too early.

04:42.583 --> 04:44.375
You two are going to work
for me now,

04:44.458 --> 04:45.834
because I may be a supervillain,

04:45.917 --> 04:48.542
but I still need someone
to get froyo with.

04:51.375 --> 04:53.458
I'm fine, by the way.

04:53.542 --> 04:56.583
Thanks for waiting for me.

04:56.667 --> 05:00.250
Skylar. Skylar.

05:00.333 --> 05:02.333
I can't believe it's you.
I hope I don't piddle.

05:02.417 --> 05:05.083
When I get excited,
I sometimes piddle.

05:05.166 --> 05:06.667
Grab Hapax.

05:06.750 --> 05:12.041
(Skylar) Down, Kakai-Rata-Hee-
Haw-Mwuaak-Floopy-Pa-zoing. Down.

05:12.125 --> 05:15.959
(suspense music)

05:21.625 --> 05:22.792
Gus?

05:22.875 --> 05:24.750
I can't believe
you're still working here.

05:24.834 --> 05:26.542
Still no sign of
Wallace and Clyde?

05:26.625 --> 05:27.750
Nope.

05:27.834 --> 05:29.792
Maybe they finally got their
children's book published

05:29.875 --> 05:32.250
about the twin earthworms
who run a comic book store

05:32.333 --> 05:34.834
and leave once they finally get
their children's book published.

05:37.500 --> 05:42.041
(suspense music playing)

05:42.125 --> 05:44.375
Gus, Gus, did you just see that?

05:44.458 --> 05:46.000
I can't see anything.

05:46.083 --> 05:48.583
I think I need glasses.

05:48.667 --> 05:52.458
These fake ones are just
to make me look studly.

05:52.542 --> 05:55.709
Two guys who looked exactly
like Tecton and Blue Tornado

05:55.792 --> 05:58.542
just, like, dropped out of the sky.

05:58.625 --> 06:01.375
I think you need glasses, too.

06:01.458 --> 06:02.792
I'm not seeing things.

06:02.875 --> 06:05.083
I know. I meant to improve your looks.

06:07.625 --> 06:08.750
(Gus) Wow.

06:08.834 --> 06:10.875
Are you busy tonight?

06:14.458 --> 06:16.875
The Annihilator wants us
to destroy Caduceo.

06:16.959 --> 06:19.750
And the only way to do that is
with the Mirror of Zalkanikus,

06:19.834 --> 06:23.291
which when he looks into it,
will drain his powers.

06:23.375 --> 06:25.625
I heard it's somewhere
in this comic book shop.

06:25.709 --> 06:27.333
But we need to stay undercover.

06:34.291 --> 06:37.458
We're wearing the same outfit?
That's embarrassing.

06:40.458 --> 06:46.000
Gus, I know this makes no sense
but, I think superheroes are real.

06:46.083 --> 06:50.250
I just saw those guys switch from their
uniforms to street clothes like that.

06:50.333 --> 06:53.542
Jordan, superheroes are not real.

06:53.625 --> 06:55.250
That's just crazy talk.

06:55.333 --> 06:56.583
Oh, and so is this.

06:56.667 --> 06:58.667
(murmuring)

07:01.500 --> 07:03.417
(intense music playing)

07:03.500 --> 07:06.000
(Oliver) Hapax, how you doing?

07:06.083 --> 07:07.166
Not good.

07:07.250 --> 07:10.709
My place is trashed and my cave-keeper
doesn't come until next week.

07:11.542 --> 07:14.500
Also, I'm very badly hurt.

07:15.667 --> 07:17.625
(Kaz) All right. We have to contact
The League of Heroes

07:17.709 --> 07:20.125
and get them to take Skylar out.

07:20.208 --> 07:23.041
(Oliver) What?
No, we can't quit on Skylar.

07:23.125 --> 07:24.667
We have to save her.

07:24.750 --> 07:26.500
Why are you so obsessed
with saving her?

07:26.583 --> 07:27.709
How about saving me?

07:27.792 --> 07:29.917
Well, maybe she's more
worth saving than you are.

07:30.000 --> 07:32.667
Really? Which one of us
has tried to destroy you

07:32.750 --> 07:35.000
about 12 times in the last week,
me or Skylar?

07:35.083 --> 07:36.417
Oh, I can't remember.

07:36.500 --> 07:39.125
Skylar.
How could you not remember that?

07:40.917 --> 07:43.458
Look, I know you have
this fantasy about Skylar

07:43.542 --> 07:44.792
falling in love with you,

07:44.875 --> 07:49.375
but I've got some news for you, pal,
it's never going to happen.

07:49.458 --> 07:53.709
Well, I've got some news
for you, pal, shut your face.

07:56.208 --> 07:57.208
Skylar's coming.

07:57.291 --> 07:59.000
-We must hide.
-Fine.

07:59.083 --> 08:00.333
But I'm not hiding with Oliver.

08:00.417 --> 08:03.166
-Come on, Hapax.
-No, Hapax, come with me.

08:05.083 --> 08:08.583
I'm going to hide with Kaz
but only because he asked first.

08:08.667 --> 08:10.583
(laughs)

08:10.667 --> 08:13.709
(intense music playing)

08:13.792 --> 08:15.500
You can't hide for long.

08:15.583 --> 08:17.959
My Skylar Sense will detect you.

08:18.041 --> 08:21.041
That, or I'll hear Kaz,
because he hums when he's nervous.

08:21.125 --> 08:22.458
(humming)

08:22.542 --> 08:23.458
(laughs)

08:23.542 --> 08:24.375
Great.

08:24.458 --> 08:26.250
Why did I choose to hide
with you?

08:28.917 --> 08:30.417
I'm right here.

08:31.458 --> 08:35.375
You're too powerful and no one
can stop you, so I give up.

08:35.458 --> 08:37.250
Hmm, how sweet.

08:37.333 --> 08:39.542
Trying to sacrifice yourself
to save Kaz.

08:39.625 --> 08:41.959
No, I'm trying to save myself.

08:42.041 --> 08:44.125
I'm done with Kaz.

08:44.208 --> 08:48.625
He and Hapax
are behind that rock.

08:48.709 --> 08:50.667
(laser beams, explosions)

09:00.583 --> 09:04.542
Okay. I'll pretend to be a normal customer
who's browsing,

09:04.625 --> 09:07.834
and I'll find the Mirror of Zalkanikus
and steal it.

09:07.917 --> 09:10.625
You go find Caduceo's whereabouts.

09:10.709 --> 09:12.500
You don't talk much, do you?

09:14.500 --> 09:16.583
I'm telling you,
I know what I saw!

09:16.667 --> 09:19.166
At least I think I do.

09:20.583 --> 09:22.750
Oh, remember to say it
exactly that way

09:22.834 --> 09:25.458
to your court-appointed psychiatrist.

09:28.417 --> 09:31.333
Wait. I have a way to prove
this guy is Tecton.

09:31.417 --> 09:34.083
The meteor in Tecton's chest
contains iron.

09:34.166 --> 09:38.000
If I can get a hold of an electromagnet,
it'll stick to his chest.

09:38.083 --> 09:40.208
But where am I going to find
an electromagnet?

09:40.291 --> 09:42.417
Right here in my backpack.

09:45.208 --> 09:48.834
What, you don't carry an electromagnet
with you at all times?

09:48.917 --> 09:51.834
You're so weird.

09:51.917 --> 09:53.500
Just distract him for a minute.

09:56.458 --> 09:58.000
Can I help you?

09:58.083 --> 10:01.458
-Uh, no thanks.
-Just shopping for my son.

10:01.542 --> 10:03.542
We don't sell children here.

10:05.083 --> 10:07.417
What kind of store
do you think this is?

10:09.542 --> 10:12.417
(Jordan) Watch this.

10:12.500 --> 10:15.542
(static buzzing)

10:23.500 --> 10:25.500
Oh, my goodness. Jordan!

10:25.583 --> 10:27.250
Let me help you!

10:30.375 --> 10:32.500
There. Much better.

10:35.333 --> 10:39.000
I cannot believe you sold me out.
I'm never talking to you again.

10:39.083 --> 10:41.041
Hmm, too bad.
Really going to miss

10:41.125 --> 10:43.750
all the dangling participles
and indefinite pronouns.

10:45.959 --> 10:49.250
All right, Skylar,
I'm ready to become a villain.

10:49.333 --> 10:52.792
Will it hurt? I hope it won't hurt.

10:52.875 --> 10:55.750
-Hapax, you have to drain her powers.
-I'm too injured.

10:55.834 --> 10:58.041
She'd destroy me before I could finish.

11:04.417 --> 11:05.792
-What's happening?
-This is coal,

11:05.875 --> 11:07.417
Skylar's one weakness.

11:07.500 --> 11:08.792
Hapax, drain her powers

11:08.875 --> 11:11.166
while she's too weak to stop you.

11:11.250 --> 11:14.083
(grunting)

11:17.542 --> 11:21.291
Kaz, look, her hair,
it turned pink.

11:21.375 --> 11:23.166
Skylar's a superhero again!

11:23.250 --> 11:24.500
I'm afraid not.

11:24.583 --> 11:27.166
To extract Skylar's evilness
I also had to extract her powers,

11:27.250 --> 11:29.542
and I can't give them back
to her because they're tainted.

11:29.625 --> 11:31.709
You can't separate one
from the other.

11:31.792 --> 11:35.375
Like my granddaughter
and her no-good hippie boyfriend.

11:35.458 --> 11:36.917
Don't worry, Skylar.

11:37.000 --> 11:39.208
We'll figure out a way to get
your powers back again.

11:39.291 --> 11:42.542
But, for now, at least you're okay.

11:46.000 --> 11:47.792
The Annihilator?
I thought you were dead!

11:47.875 --> 11:48.917
Not yet.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.875
But now that traitor Skylar Storm will be.

11:58.542 --> 11:59.917
What's happening?

12:00.000 --> 12:01.583
I drained the Annihilator's life force.

12:01.667 --> 12:05.375
That wave of power will release everyone
who was under his influence.

12:05.458 --> 12:07.375
So, all the superheroes
whose powers he tainted

12:07.458 --> 12:09.000
will instantly not be evil anymore?

12:09.083 --> 12:10.625
Of course not.

12:10.709 --> 12:12.834
We're a billion light-years
away from Earth.

12:12.917 --> 12:14.875
The wave won't get there instantly.

12:14.959 --> 12:19.125
It could take anywhere
from 1,500 to 2,000... seconds.

12:20.542 --> 12:23.166
I really did not expect you
to say "seconds."

12:32.333 --> 12:33.625
He's gone!

12:33.709 --> 12:35.083
We did it.

12:35.166 --> 12:37.000
We defeated the Annihilator!

12:37.083 --> 12:38.458
We?

12:44.750 --> 12:46.959
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

12:47.041 --> 12:49.291
He just grazed my shoulder.

12:49.375 --> 12:50.792
Thank you.

12:50.875 --> 12:53.500
You not only saved me
and the other superheroes,

12:53.583 --> 12:56.083
but everyone on Earth.

12:56.166 --> 12:59.291
So we saved the people
who save people,

12:59.375 --> 13:01.166
and also saved the people
who are usually saved

13:01.250 --> 13:03.166
by the people who save people.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.667
Wait.

13:09.750 --> 13:11.917
Look at Skylar's wound.

13:12.000 --> 13:15.583
(Oliver) Oh, no. The Annihilator shot her
with Black Widower's poison power.

13:15.667 --> 13:17.208
It must be spreading
throughout her body.

13:17.291 --> 13:19.792
-That means...
-She's dying.

13:19.875 --> 13:22.542
(suspense music playing)

13:28.667 --> 13:31.750
We have to get Skylar to Mighty Med fast!
She's incredibly weak.

13:31.834 --> 13:33.125
I'm weak?

13:33.208 --> 13:35.917
You can't even do five pushups.

13:36.625 --> 13:39.667
Wow. She gets nasty
when she's poisoned.

13:40.709 --> 13:41.792
Okay, ready?

13:44.917 --> 13:46.709
The wormhole transporter
isn't working!

13:46.792 --> 13:48.166
The battery must be dead!

13:48.250 --> 13:49.875
Oh, no. Oh, no.

13:49.959 --> 13:52.417
The battery's dead,
then Skylar's gonna be dead.

13:52.500 --> 13:55.417
And we'll be stuck on this planet
and then we'll be dead! It's all over.

13:55.500 --> 13:57.625
No, no, it's not! You always do this.

13:57.709 --> 13:59.333
Whenever the going gets tough,
you give up.

13:59.417 --> 14:02.375
That's not true. I can name tons
of times where I didn't give up.

14:02.458 --> 14:04.375
-Name one.
-I'll name ten!

14:04.458 --> 14:06.917
There was ... yeah, I give up.

14:08.834 --> 14:12.083
Unlike you, Hapax and I won't
just lie down and be quitters.

14:15.125 --> 14:17.500
Hapax! Wake up!

14:19.208 --> 14:21.792
Sorry. I always nap at noon,

14:21.875 --> 14:23.166
and at 2:00.

14:23.250 --> 14:25.542
And at 4:15.

14:25.625 --> 14:28.625
What? I'm retired,
and I have no hobbies.

14:28.709 --> 14:31.542
Do you have any powers that could get
the wormhole transporter to work?

14:31.625 --> 14:34.792
No, but I could send you back
using my teleportation power.

14:34.875 --> 14:36.500
That's how I got here years ago.

14:36.583 --> 14:38.750
-Okay, then, do it!
-But I should warn you,

14:38.834 --> 14:42.625
if I use my powers on a non-mutant,
there could be some side effects.

14:42.709 --> 14:44.625
Like what?
Like, shortness of breath?

14:44.709 --> 14:46.375
Well, shortness.

14:46.458 --> 14:49.625
You might have no legs.

14:49.709 --> 14:52.250
Skylar's running out of time, okay.
It doesn't matter what the risks are!

14:52.333 --> 14:53.750
-Just do it!
-Okay.

14:53.834 --> 14:58.458
-Kneel down before me!
-Why?

14:58.542 --> 15:01.458
I don't know.
It makes me feel more powerful.

15:03.250 --> 15:05.583
Okay. We're ready.

15:05.667 --> 15:07.959
Wait, I want a souvenir.

15:14.959 --> 15:16.417
We made it!

15:16.500 --> 15:19.333
My legs are gone!

15:19.417 --> 15:22.834
You're still kneeling.

15:22.917 --> 15:25.291
-My hand!
-It's in your pocket.

15:25.375 --> 15:27.083
(intense music playing)

15:27.166 --> 15:29.875
What's going on?
What's wrong with Skylar?

15:29.959 --> 15:32.041
The Annihilator shot her with
Black Widower's poison power.

15:32.125 --> 15:33.250
We're losing her!

15:33.333 --> 15:35.083
Get her on the gurney, stat!

15:39.041 --> 15:40.417
She's too weak.

15:40.500 --> 15:43.458
We have to stabilize her before
we can administer the antidote.

15:52.542 --> 15:54.375
She's flat-lining!
Do something!

15:54.458 --> 15:56.208
I need the defibrillator!

15:57.834 --> 16:02.000
Clear!

16:16.792 --> 16:19.166
I'm sorry.

16:19.250 --> 16:20.875
She's gone.

16:20.959 --> 16:24.166
(sad music playing)

16:33.417 --> 16:37.041
I know that's Tecton, and there's
got to be some way to prove it.

16:37.125 --> 16:39.875
Wait. Tecton always heals.

16:39.959 --> 16:42.208
I'll just injure him
and when he shows no pain

16:42.291 --> 16:44.917
and heals right before our eyes,
you'll see that I'm right.

16:48.041 --> 16:51.291
(mystical music playing)

16:51.375 --> 16:52.542
Waah!

16:52.625 --> 16:55.542
Aah!

16:55.625 --> 16:58.458
You just threw a spear into my leg!

16:58.542 --> 17:01.917
-What's wrong with you?
-I am so sorry!

17:02.000 --> 17:03.291
I thought you were someone else.

17:03.375 --> 17:05.500
That you wanted to throw a spear at?

17:07.375 --> 17:08.875
I'll go find a doctor.

17:08.959 --> 17:12.166
But first, I don't want any
of my dirty fingerprints

17:12.250 --> 17:13.875
to infect the wound.

17:19.375 --> 17:21.458
I better get you a bandage.

17:27.208 --> 17:28.709
(Gus) Hey!

17:29.875 --> 17:33.750
You look just like a superhero
on this box!

17:37.000 --> 17:38.875
Yeah, I get that a lot.

17:41.542 --> 17:44.208
(lonely music playing)

17:48.625 --> 17:50.959
I can't believe Skylar's gone.

17:51.041 --> 17:55.250
She can't be! I mean, Mighty Med
is the best hospital in the world!

17:55.333 --> 17:57.875
There's gotta be someone
or something able to heal her.

17:57.959 --> 17:59.583
Horace, please!

17:59.667 --> 18:03.500
(magical music playing)

18:03.583 --> 18:05.542
Stand back.

18:05.625 --> 18:08.208
(magical music playing)

18:08.291 --> 18:10.917
Thanatoi bios.

18:11.000 --> 18:13.959
Bioi thanatos.

18:14.041 --> 18:17.000
(mystical music playing)

18:33.250 --> 18:34.709
She's alive.

18:34.792 --> 18:37.083
Horace, how did you do that?

18:37.166 --> 18:40.417
Only Caduceo can bring people
back to life.

18:40.500 --> 18:42.125
(Dr. Horace) (sighs)

18:42.208 --> 18:44.375
I am Caduceo,

18:44.458 --> 18:47.709
the legendary healer of superheroes.

18:47.792 --> 18:49.041
What?

18:49.125 --> 18:52.667
I couldn't tell anyone my true identity
for security reasons.

18:52.750 --> 18:55.917
Also, everyone kept asking
so many follow-up questions.

18:57.375 --> 18:59.375
You're Caduceo?

18:59.458 --> 19:00.834
That's incredible.

19:00.917 --> 19:02.792
But why didn't you save Skylar
right away?

19:02.875 --> 19:05.792
-Why did you hesitate?
-Here we go with the questions.

19:07.583 --> 19:09.125
When I use my powers,

19:09.208 --> 19:12.250
they have a terrible,
irreversible effect on me.

19:12.333 --> 19:16.083
I gain a pound right in my hips.

19:16.166 --> 19:17.500
So embarrassing.

19:19.000 --> 19:22.875
Also, I only have the power
to restore life five times.

19:22.959 --> 19:25.792
I only have one left.

19:25.875 --> 19:27.542
Where am I?

19:27.625 --> 19:28.959
What happened?

19:29.041 --> 19:30.834
We're back in Mighty Med.

19:30.917 --> 19:33.250
It's a long story but you're fine.

19:34.458 --> 19:36.291
Where are my hands?

19:37.583 --> 19:39.083
Under the sheets.

19:41.000 --> 19:42.625
I have been there.

19:42.709 --> 19:44.583
It is terrifying.

19:46.500 --> 19:49.000
Kaz, thanks for not giving up
on Skylar

19:49.083 --> 19:52.000
and I'm sorry for saying
all those mean things to you.

19:52.083 --> 19:56.458
Yeah, I'm sorry, too, man. I should have
known you weren't a traitor.

19:58.709 --> 20:01.875
Since we're apologizing,

20:01.959 --> 20:06.417
I'm sorry for trying to viciously
slaughter you guys all those times.

20:07.583 --> 20:09.250
Ah, we all make mistakes.

20:13.375 --> 20:15.208
Horace, did you gain weight?

20:15.291 --> 20:18.500
(upbeat music playing)

20:20.792 --> 20:23.875
I need that mirror of Zalkanikus.
Keep looking.

20:23.959 --> 20:26.792
Oh, wait, here it is.

20:28.083 --> 20:29.834
You know, the comic books say

20:29.917 --> 20:32.375
there's something special
about this mirror.

20:32.458 --> 20:33.959
What was it again?

20:34.041 --> 20:36.291
Oh, I know, it's unbreakable.

20:40.125 --> 20:42.333
Wait, not unbreakable.

20:42.417 --> 20:44.250
Irreplaceable.

20:44.333 --> 20:45.709
(laughs)

20:45.792 --> 20:47.917
Sorry, that was our last one.

20:49.375 --> 20:52.125
No, there's not one under
the couch.

21:07.458 --> 21:11.542
So, I couldn't find a doctor,
but I did find this chemical

21:11.625 --> 21:14.500
which can eliminate all
lingering traces of DNA.

21:17.750 --> 21:20.500
(Gus) Jordan, Jordan,
you will not believe

21:20.583 --> 21:23.000
what he just did with the couch.

21:23.083 --> 21:24.458
He moved it over an inch.

21:24.542 --> 21:26.750
It totally opens up the room.

21:28.750 --> 21:30.041
You're welcome.

21:33.542 --> 21:36.959
(theme music playing)
