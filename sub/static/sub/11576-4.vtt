WEBVTT

00:06.757 --> 00:10.045
(grunts)

00:10.261 --> 00:11.797
I'm just-- I'm
getting restless, Dyson.

00:12.013 --> 00:14.550
The last thing I remember
is being taken from the Dal,

00:14.765 --> 00:16.050
and then waking
up in the woods.

00:16.267 --> 00:17.803
I can't keep hiding,
waiting for answers.

00:18.019 --> 00:20.101
Gotta lay low until
the Una Mens settle down.

00:20.313 --> 00:22.770
So they want me dead.
Line up! Take a number!

00:22.982 --> 00:23.767
Welcome to the club!

00:23.983 --> 00:24.813
Should I keep going?

00:25.026 --> 00:26.607
This is bigger
than you think, Bo.

00:26.819 --> 00:28.104
The Una Mens power is ancient.

00:28.321 --> 00:29.811
Dun dun dun.

00:31.532 --> 00:32.237
I'm serious.

00:32.450 --> 00:33.109
I'm sorry.

00:33.326 --> 00:35.032
But fancy councils?

00:35.244 --> 00:36.359
Ye old rules?

00:36.579 --> 00:40.197
It's just, it's the
last thing on my mind.

00:40.917 --> 00:43.704
You want to talk about
that first thing on your mind?

00:46.005 --> 00:48.337
...Any word?

00:48.549 --> 00:49.664
Not lately.

00:49.884 --> 00:51.670
But it's better
that she stays away

00:51.886 --> 00:53.968
safe with all
of these unknowns.

00:54.180 --> 00:55.465
Lauren's smart,
she can handle herself.

00:55.681 --> 00:58.798
Well, since I have
to protect myself

00:59.018 --> 01:00.974
from all these unknowns...

01:04.565 --> 01:06.601
I should get a hit.

01:06.817 --> 01:08.193
Below the belt.

01:12.949 --> 01:15.611
Something is
different about you.

01:15.826 --> 01:19.239
Well... You seem to like it.

01:19.455 --> 01:21.116
In a huge way.

02:22.351 --> 02:24.558
(faint screech)

02:25.187 --> 02:26.723
What was that?

02:26.939 --> 02:30.773
I don't know. Old pipes?

02:38.159 --> 02:40.946
Life is hard when you
don 't know who you are.

02:41.162 --> 02:43.949
It's harder when you
don 't know what you are.

02:44.165 --> 02:46.907
My love carries
a death sentence.

02:47.126 --> 02:51.916
I was lost for years...
Searching, while hiding.

02:52.131 --> 02:56.090
Only to find that I belong
to a world hidden from humans.

02:56.302 --> 02:57.792
I won 't hide anymore.

02:58.012 --> 03:00.503
I will live the life I choose.

03:06.604 --> 03:08.265
All right, less
hooch, more tooch!

03:08.481 --> 03:09.641
Owww-Owww. . .

03:09.857 --> 03:11.848
Okay, okay, one more knot.
Just breathe, just breathe.

03:12.068 --> 03:13.933
There you go. There you go.

03:14.153 --> 03:18.772
Done. God, not a single strand.

03:18.991 --> 03:20.572
I'm done twerking out.

03:20.785 --> 03:21.865
Can I have Cheezies?

03:22.078 --> 03:23.193
Yes, you can have Cheezies.

03:23.412 --> 03:24.367
Thank you.

03:25.998 --> 03:27.033
Ugh!

03:27.249 --> 03:29.661
Kenz, Trick's lgnis
Rim is acting up again.

03:29.877 --> 03:31.663
Ugh, coming! Sorry.

03:31.879 --> 03:33.164
| probablyjust
set it up wrong.

03:33.381 --> 03:35.622
It's only supposed to
block out malicious Fae.

03:42.348 --> 03:45.306
Oh, I am so glad you're home.

03:45.976 --> 03:46.931
Come here.

03:47.603 --> 03:50.515
You smell like sweaty gym-dude
and I don't even care.

03:50.731 --> 03:53.598
Uh, Kenz, I've been gone
an hour. And not that l mind,

03:53.818 --> 03:55.979
but how long is this
incessant hugging gonna last?

03:56.195 --> 03:59.187
As long as it takes to
forget you were ever gone.

03:59.407 --> 04:00.112
Cheezie?

04:00.324 --> 04:02.189
No. I'm good, I already ate.

04:02.410 --> 04:03.445
Dyson and |just--

04:03.661 --> 04:07.119
Oh! Not in front of
the B-A-B-Y V-A-L-K...E?

04:07.331 --> 04:08.286
Or is it, Y?

04:08.499 --> 04:09.329
I'm not a baby!

04:09.542 --> 04:11.282
I'm almost two
weeks old. Thank you.

04:11.502 --> 04:12.867
All right, tweener 'tude.

04:13.087 --> 04:14.623
You remember who
you work for yet?

04:14.839 --> 04:16.420
I already told you,
I don't remember.

04:16.632 --> 04:18.372
It's called a
previous life, okay?

04:18.592 --> 04:20.628
So far, all I
know is that I'm Dark.

04:20.845 --> 04:22.551
Which makes me think you know
more than you're telling me...

04:22.763 --> 04:27.097
Oh, you know, kids
this age. Whaddya gonna do?

04:31.647 --> 04:33.808
You know what?
Screw club house arrest.

04:34.024 --> 04:35.639
Mm! Let's go out.

04:35.860 --> 04:37.270
What about Cheezie
breath over here?

04:37.486 --> 04:38.646
Hey, Lil' T.

04:38.863 --> 04:41.275
Do you wanna come out with
us? Totally boring, not fun.

04:41.490 --> 04:43.776
Or do you want to
stay in safety rim zone

04:43.993 --> 04:45.324
and watch the X-Files again?

04:45.536 --> 04:46.116
X-Files.

04:46.328 --> 04:47.033
Yes!

04:47.246 --> 04:48.406
Done. Mm!

04:48.622 --> 04:50.999
Drinks! Yeah!

04:51.208 --> 04:53.039
Drink to us.

04:54.170 --> 04:56.957
Mmm. It is like
occupied France in here.

04:57.173 --> 04:58.208
What's with the cry tunes?

04:58.424 --> 05:00.210
Una Mens come to town,
errrrything shut down.

05:00.426 --> 05:02.382
Yeah well, l was hoping
for a real night out.

05:02.595 --> 05:04.051
Well, sorry
Miss Spring Breaker.

05:04.263 --> 05:06.049
I promised Dyson I'd
take you somewhere safe.

05:06.265 --> 05:09.883
You do remember a cloud of black
smoke kidnapped me here, right?

05:10.102 --> 05:11.512
Right.

05:12.354 --> 05:13.935
Do we know anything
about this Wander--

05:14.148 --> 05:17.436
Ahhh. I don't feel
like talking about it.

05:17.651 --> 05:18.936
I wanna dance.

05:19.653 --> 05:21.814
Are you for real? Right here?

05:22.031 --> 05:23.111
ln Sadville?

05:38.172 --> 05:40.788
Now that is more like it.

05:43.344 --> 05:45.050
Bobo Returns.

05:49.767 --> 05:52.053
With bonus features?

06:10.371 --> 06:11.486
Hey!

06:12.331 --> 06:13.571
Did you bring it?

06:13.791 --> 06:14.621
I'm in a rush.

06:14.833 --> 06:16.448
What? Flip flop sample sale?

06:16.669 --> 06:17.954
I'm done with the kiddy toys.

06:18.170 --> 06:19.501
lt's Tonka Truck time.

06:19.713 --> 06:23.126
You can't even dream to
afford for permanent powers.

06:23.342 --> 06:26.004
You can't even pay
me for what I supply.

06:26.220 --> 06:29.212
Look, you will get paid...

06:29.431 --> 06:31.592
As soon as my
powers stop fading.

06:31.809 --> 06:33.299
Massimo.

06:42.152 --> 06:43.767
Kenzi?

06:43.988 --> 06:45.319
Bo?

06:45.531 --> 06:46.771
Mulder?

06:46.991 --> 06:48.276
Scully? (gasps)

06:48.492 --> 06:50.699
Oh my god, what
are you doing here?

07:05.593 --> 07:09.131
(cracking) Ahhh, ah-ow.

07:09.471 --> 07:11.007
J‘ So here's a
story from A-to-Z J‘

07:11.223 --> 07:13.305
J‘ You wanna get with me
you gotta listen carefully J‘

07:13.517 --> 07:16.304
J‘We got Em in the place
who likes it in your face. J‘

07:16.520 --> 07:18.727
J‘You got G like MC who likes
it on an Easy V doesn't J‘

07:18.939 --> 07:20.770
J‘ come for free.
She's a real lady, J‘

07:20.983 --> 07:22.769
J‘ and as for me,
ah you'll see. J‘

07:22.985 --> 07:25.067
J‘ Slam your body down
and wind it all around. J‘

07:25.279 --> 07:27.361
J‘ Slam your body down
and wind it all around! J‘

07:27.573 --> 07:29.234
J‘ If you wanna be my lover. J‘

07:29.450 --> 07:30.815
J‘ You gotta get

07:31.035 --> 07:32.241
J‘ You gotta get
with my friends. J‘

07:32.453 --> 07:34.694
J‘ Make it last forever... J‘

07:37.541 --> 07:38.906
Surprise!

07:39.126 --> 07:41.117
Are you so mad?

07:41.337 --> 07:42.622
Actually, that was
freakin' incredible!

07:42.838 --> 07:43.543
Ahhh!

07:43.756 --> 07:44.791
(laughing)

07:46.008 --> 07:49.375
It feels so good to be bad.

07:52.264 --> 07:53.253
Kenzi.

07:53.766 --> 07:55.222
We've been robbed.

07:55.684 --> 07:57.140
Tamsin.

08:03.525 --> 08:05.356
I think I grew again.

08:09.823 --> 08:11.654
People were in our home.

08:11.867 --> 08:13.073
Strangers!

08:13.285 --> 08:15.617
Strangers with great taste
in thrift shop furniture!

08:15.829 --> 08:17.615
Would you like me to get
you something? A coffee?

08:17.831 --> 08:18.581
Or a chair to break?

08:18.791 --> 08:20.031
I'm gonna break
whoever did this.

08:20.250 --> 08:22.036
We had a child in the home!

08:24.171 --> 08:25.456
Sort of.

08:25.673 --> 08:27.004
Ugh, could this be Una Mens?

08:27.216 --> 08:28.422
No, they're not thieves.

08:28.634 --> 08:31.467
Material possessions
don't interest them.

08:31.679 --> 08:33.385
Or maybe this isn't
Fae-related at all.

08:33.597 --> 08:35.758
Maybe it's just a
good old break and enter.

08:35.974 --> 08:38.135
If that rim was up,
humans could still enter.

08:38.352 --> 08:40.434
Fae or not, no one
comes into my house

08:40.646 --> 08:41.886
and takes what's mine.

08:42.106 --> 08:44.563
You know, if you need to
unwind later, we could, uh...

08:46.694 --> 08:48.400
Go shopping.

08:48.612 --> 08:50.603
Go shopping, yeah.

08:50.823 --> 08:55.192
Well, if you're good,
you can go in all the stores.

08:56.578 --> 08:59.536
Well if you're good, I'll
max out your credit cards.

08:59.748 --> 09:00.908
Twice.

09:01.125 --> 09:02.490
Can I come?

09:05.337 --> 09:07.623
I've got a suspicious
lead to track.

09:07.840 --> 09:08.374
Let me help.

09:08.590 --> 09:10.171
Oh, you already are.

09:10.384 --> 09:12.921
I'll explain when | get
back from the facilities!

09:14.096 --> 09:17.554
Bo! The bathroom
is... the other way.

09:22.104 --> 09:23.810
And I'm babysitting.

09:27.776 --> 09:29.186
Who's that girl?

09:29.403 --> 09:33.897
Someone who's lost. And
you and I need to find her.

09:41.498 --> 09:43.910
This is all my fault.

09:44.126 --> 09:45.366
I believed them...

09:47.671 --> 09:49.832
They told me they
wouldn't hurt you.

09:55.304 --> 09:56.544
Who are "they"?

09:56.764 --> 09:58.254
Hello.

09:58.474 --> 10:00.931
Long time no see, Lauren.

10:01.143 --> 10:02.553
Or should I call you...

10:02.770 --> 10:04.306
Karen.

10:06.273 --> 10:07.854
Come on, Massimo.

10:08.066 --> 10:11.524
I've got wallets to
lift; shoes to covet...

10:11.737 --> 10:13.978
Ugh! Ow! What the hell?!

10:14.198 --> 10:15.187
Hey!

10:16.700 --> 10:19.612
Okay, where is my usual SUV
and Venti-Mocha-lced-latte?

10:19.828 --> 10:22.490
No VIP treatment for
customers that don't pay.

10:22.831 --> 10:24.537
He's sending a message.

10:24.750 --> 10:26.581
Well you-- You
give a message that

10:26.794 --> 10:30.207
he can take this zip tie and
put it around his tiny druid--

10:30.422 --> 10:32.128
(punching and kicking sounds)

10:32.341 --> 10:33.296
Hello?!

10:33.509 --> 10:34.749
What's happening?

10:34.968 --> 10:36.083
Three-nothing, Bo.

10:36.303 --> 10:39.420
Take our things, but
you will not take my Kenzi.

10:39.640 --> 10:41.471
Uh, followed you just
in time, sketch bag.

10:41.683 --> 10:42.092
Come on.

10:42.309 --> 10:43.424
Oh. Thank you

10:43.644 --> 10:44.224
for saving me!

10:44.436 --> 10:45.221
Kenz.

10:45.437 --> 10:46.938
Since when do
you fly solo, huh?

10:47.147 --> 10:49.263
I'm back, we're
back, baby got back.

10:49.483 --> 10:50.017
Together-like.

10:50.234 --> 10:51.098
Look, I know these guys.

10:51.318 --> 10:52.478
Like, called them know them.

10:52.694 --> 10:54.150
What? You're into
getting zip-tied now?

10:54.363 --> 10:55.773
No, I know who robbed us.

10:55.989 --> 10:58.025
But it's my problem
and I can handle it.

10:58.242 --> 10:59.982
Hey, it's our problem.

11:00.202 --> 11:02.033
Let's get our shit back.

11:02.246 --> 11:03.827
So who is this guy, anyway?

11:04.039 --> 11:05.370
Massimo.

11:06.625 --> 11:08.081
Druid Massimo?

11:08.293 --> 11:08.952
You know him?

11:09.169 --> 11:11.410
Yeah, I do. And he sucks.

11:15.801 --> 11:19.919
Lava, cages, creepy Druid.

11:20.138 --> 11:21.423
Bo.

11:21.640 --> 11:24.507
Tough times in parts unknown?

11:24.726 --> 11:27.103
Not that you would remember.

11:27.813 --> 11:30.179
Your rune glass
potion fell flat.

11:30.858 --> 11:33.099
Yeah, I'm not so
sure that it did.

11:34.570 --> 11:36.811
Thanks to the
seal from your kiss.

11:37.030 --> 11:39.191
Rune-glass-potion-what-now?

11:39.408 --> 11:42.115
I like to know when
I'm sealing something.

11:42.327 --> 11:44.784
He gave Tamsin a
potion to kill me.

11:44.997 --> 11:46.157
Actually, to mark you.

11:46.373 --> 11:48.329
Allow you to transcend planes;

11:48.542 --> 11:49.702
to be collected.

11:49.918 --> 11:53.706
An insurance policy in
case Tamsin didn't pan out.

11:54.756 --> 11:56.667
It's a shame that she died.

11:58.051 --> 12:00.428
Tragic.

12:00.637 --> 12:02.298
Who took me?

12:02.681 --> 12:05.593
Unfortunately, I was just
hired to deliver the goods.

12:05.809 --> 12:07.925
There must be something
I can tell you...

12:08.145 --> 12:09.055
Nah.

12:09.271 --> 12:10.852
There's nothing.

12:12.816 --> 12:14.852
Well here's how
this is gonna go:

12:15.068 --> 12:16.649
You're gonna give
us our stuff back

12:16.862 --> 12:18.727
and then you're gonna
leave Kenzi alone.

12:18.947 --> 12:22.110
She won't be requiring
your services any longer.

12:27.372 --> 12:28.623
That doesn't settle her debt.

12:28.832 --> 12:29.787
No?

12:30.000 --> 12:31.740
How about a knee
to your euro-sack?

12:31.960 --> 12:34.417
Okay, okay why don't we
just handle this like adults?!

12:34.630 --> 12:36.916
Fae, Druid, human --
comin' together.

12:37.132 --> 12:37.712
Peace on earth.

12:37.925 --> 12:39.165
We are the world.

12:39.384 --> 12:41.591
Kind of... stuff.

12:41.803 --> 12:43.088
l have a proposal.

12:43.305 --> 12:44.795
Mm, here comes
the threesome request.

12:45.015 --> 12:47.506
Let's bank the trio
idea until next time.

12:47.726 --> 12:49.591
The Japanese
Salsola Soda herb.

12:49.811 --> 12:51.017
It's very rare.

12:51.229 --> 12:54.016
But I hear it grows on the
Light Fae Doctor's green wall.

12:54.232 --> 12:55.768
You want me to
go to Lauren's?

12:58.654 --> 13:00.770
You get it for
me, and we're even.

13:02.574 --> 13:03.950
Geraldine?

13:05.494 --> 13:06.574
I'm taking this back.

13:06.787 --> 13:08.152
What about our stuff?

13:09.539 --> 13:11.621
You'll get back
what I haven't burned.

13:11.833 --> 13:13.539
Did you a favour, trust me.

13:13.752 --> 13:15.242
Those accent tables?

13:17.297 --> 13:20.505
Fine. We'll get you the herb.

13:20.717 --> 13:24.255
But if you don't hold up
your end of the bargain,

13:24.471 --> 13:25.756
I'll kill you.

13:30.394 --> 13:31.679
And my hairbrush?

13:31.895 --> 13:32.930
You can keep.

13:33.146 --> 13:35.262
'Cause that's
not creepy at all...

13:50.330 --> 13:52.070
We're being watched.

13:55.085 --> 13:57.371
You found me.

13:57.587 --> 13:58.576
Now what?

13:59.339 --> 14:01.455
What's behind tarp number one?

14:04.177 --> 14:07.761
They want us to look.

14:07.973 --> 14:09.929
Play their little game.

14:10.142 --> 14:12.133
I'm done playing.

14:15.981 --> 14:16.891
I slept with you--

14:17.107 --> 14:17.391
Oh, Crystal.

14:17.607 --> 14:18.596
No.

14:20.318 --> 14:22.354
Because they made me...

14:23.321 --> 14:26.063
keep you close.

14:26.283 --> 14:28.695
But then, after I did...

14:28.910 --> 14:32.949
|-| don't know.

14:33.165 --> 14:35.577
It was different, you know?

14:35.792 --> 14:38.249
It was more.

14:45.302 --> 14:47.258
Spy-banged.

14:47.471 --> 14:49.086
Did I miss something?

14:52.309 --> 14:56.177
I've been here before.

14:56.396 --> 14:59.604
In your shoes, actually.

15:08.283 --> 15:18.375
(chains clanking)

15:23.965 --> 15:25.921
l have a brother.

15:27.803 --> 15:30.089
My only sibling.

15:30.305 --> 15:33.217
We were inseparable.

15:33.433 --> 15:36.766
Together, we were going
to change the world.

15:36.978 --> 15:39.139
Sounds nice.

15:39.356 --> 15:40.971
Yeah, yeah it was.

15:41.191 --> 15:43.648
'Til it wasn't anymore.

15:43.860 --> 15:49.105
Our version of changing
the world turned into...

15:49.324 --> 15:53.192
blowing up pipelines
using pipe bombs.

15:57.249 --> 15:59.080
Eleven people died.

16:01.002 --> 16:02.583
You're a terrorist?

16:04.256 --> 16:07.043
Nobody was supposed
to be there...

16:10.303 --> 16:12.589
Not a day goes by
that I don't hate myself

16:12.806 --> 16:14.046
for what happened.

16:16.184 --> 16:17.424
It wasn't your fault.

16:17.644 --> 16:19.885
I made the explosives.

16:20.105 --> 16:23.063
And then I trusted
my brother with them.

16:26.695 --> 16:28.481
Where is he now?

16:30.657 --> 16:32.773
Point is, is that Karen ran.

16:32.993 --> 16:35.279
And l have been
running ever since.

16:37.998 --> 16:42.412
(laughs)

16:42.627 --> 16:46.745
I don't even know why
I'm telling you this.

16:46.965 --> 16:49.081
I never even told Bo.

16:50.385 --> 16:52.125
Moving story.

16:52.345 --> 16:54.256
Now, look under the tarp.

16:56.808 --> 16:59.265
I guess I'm not done
playing games just yet.

17:02.689 --> 17:08.150
(chains clanking)

17:22.667 --> 17:25.283
An elder needs your
diagnosis within the hour.

17:25.503 --> 17:27.915
Or Crystal dies.

17:29.466 --> 17:31.957
This isn't about
eco terrorism.

17:33.470 --> 17:35.552
This is Light Fae bullshit.

17:37.933 --> 17:39.013
I'm trying to understand, Kenz.

17:39.226 --> 17:40.090
Really, I am.

17:40.310 --> 17:42.392
Why would you ever
go to that nutbag?

17:42.604 --> 17:44.765
l was tired of everyone
telling me to "go."

17:44.981 --> 17:46.266
I don't want to "go" anywhere.

17:46.483 --> 17:48.269
I want to fight with you.

17:48.485 --> 17:49.065
But you do.

17:49.277 --> 17:50.483
You always have.

17:50.695 --> 17:52.435
KENZI: Look, I thought
it'd be simple, you know.

17:52.656 --> 17:53.941
Go see Massimo. Make a deal.

17:54.157 --> 17:55.192
Become Fae.

17:55.408 --> 17:56.944
But it turned out
to be temporary.

17:57.160 --> 17:58.775
And a little on
the chintzy side.

17:58.995 --> 18:00.701
How much did it cost you?

18:00.914 --> 18:02.199
One more herb, baby.

18:03.959 --> 18:07.076
Phew! Well I'm glad
these all look identical.

18:07.295 --> 18:08.956
Where's Lauren
when you need her?

18:11.216 --> 18:12.626
Ex nostalgia attack?

18:14.761 --> 18:18.174
You know, this whole
Taft thing still baffles me.

18:18.390 --> 18:20.426
I mean, Lauren is smart!

18:20.642 --> 18:22.428
I mean, maybe she
wasn't tricked.

18:22.644 --> 18:24.384
Maybe she wanted
to work for him,

18:24.604 --> 18:26.640
you know, get
something from him?

18:26.856 --> 18:28.437
Like... a pension?

18:28.650 --> 18:30.436
I don't know.

18:30.652 --> 18:32.358
Apparently the foundation
of our entire relationship

18:32.570 --> 18:34.276
was based on "not knowing."

18:34.489 --> 18:35.854
Well, look, for
whatever it's worth

18:36.074 --> 18:38.281
I think that Lauren's
one of the good ones.

18:38.493 --> 18:40.529
| always thought
you were on Dyson.

18:40.745 --> 18:43.407
On? What-- What on?
What do you mean?

18:43.623 --> 18:45.864
Oh, you know, Team Wolf.

18:46.084 --> 18:47.415
What is this?

18:52.632 --> 18:54.088
It's true.

18:54.301 --> 18:56.883
Her name is not Lauren.

18:57.095 --> 18:58.426
lt's Karen.

18:58.638 --> 19:00.253
Karen Beattie.

19:00.473 --> 19:02.009
Okay, not the sexiest moniker.

19:02.225 --> 19:04.011
Kinda get why she
might have changed it.

19:04.227 --> 19:05.137
I didn't know her.

19:05.353 --> 19:06.684
Come on babe, that's not true.

19:06.896 --> 19:08.602
No, I don't even know her name!

19:08.815 --> 19:11.147
And now she's probably
changed it again.

19:11.359 --> 19:13.145
Started a new, better life.

19:13.361 --> 19:14.066
Somewhere safe...

19:14.279 --> 19:15.439
Away from me.

19:17.365 --> 19:18.480
Look, you okay over there?

19:18.700 --> 19:20.531
Oh, yeah. Just hangin'
out in my ex's apartment.

19:20.744 --> 19:21.403
Finding weird shit.

19:21.619 --> 19:22.779
I'm fine.

19:28.793 --> 19:32.411
What is it that makes
everyone in my life lie to me?

19:34.007 --> 19:34.757
Except for you.

19:34.966 --> 19:36.502
That's why I love you.

19:39.262 --> 19:40.593
Oh my god, I found it!

19:40.805 --> 19:42.966
Ah, also why I love you.

19:50.774 --> 19:51.889
Did you rim the door?

19:52.108 --> 19:53.188
No.

19:54.319 --> 19:56.355
lgnis Rim Converterent.

19:56.571 --> 19:57.526
Trick mentioned this.

19:57.739 --> 19:59.604
Instead of keeping
Fae out, it locks them in.

19:59.824 --> 20:01.735
Massimo must have seen ours...

20:04.621 --> 20:07.158
And he just graduated
from a-hole to douche.

20:07.374 --> 20:08.830
Okay, let me try crossing.

20:09.042 --> 20:11.249
Warning! My poly-blend
jacket is highly flammable.

20:11.461 --> 20:13.042
Drop and roll, baby.
Drop and roll.

20:13.254 --> 20:15.836
Okay, okay...

20:16.466 --> 20:18.502
Ah! Oh god!

20:18.718 --> 20:19.753
It stings like a mother!

20:19.969 --> 20:22.005
What sick game
is Massimo playing?

20:22.222 --> 20:24.929
Oh, ow! Ow, ow.

20:28.770 --> 20:29.429
Hey.

20:29.646 --> 20:31.261
Dyson. Guess what?

20:31.481 --> 20:32.311
I found Lauren's voicemail

20:32.524 --> 20:34.731
and the clubhouse
number eight times!

20:34.943 --> 20:35.557
Are you impressed?

20:35.777 --> 20:36.562
Yeah you are.

20:36.778 --> 20:39.064
His last call was two days ago.

20:39.280 --> 20:40.861
I'm gonna pull records
from all businesses

20:41.074 --> 20:42.610
and pay phones
along that highway.

20:42.826 --> 20:44.817
Get ready for
more highlighting.

20:47.497 --> 20:48.361
This is heavy.

20:48.581 --> 20:50.993
Was I a good cop?

20:51.209 --> 20:52.369
You were tough.

20:52.585 --> 20:56.954
And on a bad day, you
could be a real... monster.

20:58.633 --> 21:00.294
You think I'm hideous!

21:00.510 --> 21:02.842
Even the robbers ran
away when they saw my face!

21:03.054 --> 21:04.840
I meant monster
in a good way, okay?

21:05.056 --> 21:06.171
That doesn't even make sense!

21:06.391 --> 21:08.427
Shh! Please.

21:11.771 --> 21:13.147
ls Bo your girlfriend?

21:13.356 --> 21:14.937
No. She is not.

21:15.150 --> 21:16.981
But do you want her to be?

21:19.404 --> 21:21.690
I did.

21:21.906 --> 21:24.773
But then a lady in a
tree took my love away.

21:24.993 --> 21:29.862
And by the time I got it
back. Bo had a girlfriend.

21:30.081 --> 21:33.448
You forgot to start
with "once upon a time."

21:33.668 --> 21:34.578
Once upon a time...

21:34.794 --> 21:37.171
we never found the
right time. The End.

21:38.965 --> 21:40.421
What does love feel like?

21:40.633 --> 21:42.214
Are we really doing this?

21:48.057 --> 21:50.469
When you feel it,
you'll know it.

21:50.685 --> 21:55.349
And when it's gone, you'll
never want to lose it again.

21:55.565 --> 21:58.352
You know what, talk to Bo and
Kenzi about this stuff, okay?

21:58.568 --> 22:00.308
It's really not my bag.

22:00.528 --> 22:01.938
I can't talk to Bo.

22:02.155 --> 22:03.486
She hates me because I'm Dark.

22:03.698 --> 22:05.029
Well, everyone makes a choice.

22:05.241 --> 22:06.151
Not me.

22:06.367 --> 22:08.278
It was the me before me.

22:08.495 --> 22:11.362
Well, maybe someday you'll
get to make a better choice.

22:11.581 --> 22:12.206
Maybe not.

22:12.415 --> 22:13.871
It's not my problem.

22:14.083 --> 22:15.994
Why do you
have to be so mean?!

22:16.211 --> 22:18.042
Why do you have to
ask so many questions?!

22:18.963 --> 22:21.079
I can't believe
he Kenzi-proofed it.

22:21.299 --> 22:22.505
He's playing off my power.

22:22.717 --> 22:24.298
How do we make
you stop sparking?

22:24.511 --> 22:26.092
Ugh, it kinda just runs out.

22:26.304 --> 22:29.592
You know, like sunscreen.
Reapply after swimming.

22:29.807 --> 22:31.593
(sighs) I guess I
could take a shower...

22:31.809 --> 22:34.186
But I-I really don't
want to get my hair wet.

22:34.395 --> 22:34.975
It's an ordeal.

22:35.188 --> 22:36.052
I hear ya.

22:36.272 --> 22:37.773
You know what though,
it's been like a week.

22:37.982 --> 22:39.267
I probably should wash it.

22:39.484 --> 22:40.940
Is Lauren's conditioner
like the worst?

22:41.152 --> 22:41.857
It's the worst.

22:42.070 --> 22:43.105
Does it even
contain humectants?

22:43.321 --> 22:45.357
I mean god knows what that
woman is putting in her hair.

22:45.573 --> 22:47.609
She cannot be trusted.
I don't know about you

22:47.825 --> 22:49.611
but I need a little
peach in my shampoo.

22:49.827 --> 22:50.156
(gaSPS)

22:50.370 --> 22:53.328
(water splashing)

22:54.290 --> 22:54.745
Refreshing.

22:54.958 --> 22:56.118
Attagirl.

22:56.334 --> 22:58.620
Now, if the only
one who can remove a rim

22:58.836 --> 23:00.167
is the one who set it...

23:00.380 --> 23:01.870
No, we have to scramble it.

23:02.090 --> 23:04.251
One Pakua Mirror
and ogre eye, required.

23:04.467 --> 23:05.798
Am I the new Trick?

23:06.010 --> 23:07.341
Can you get all that stuff?

23:07.554 --> 23:08.418
Have you met me?

23:08.638 --> 23:09.923
Okay, I'm gonna save your ass.

23:10.139 --> 23:12.755
Forget Trick, I'm the new Bo!

23:12.976 --> 23:14.056
Okay.

23:47.135 --> 23:49.342
For giving me the
freedom to love.

23:52.557 --> 23:54.593
And I do.

24:33.306 --> 24:35.262
Who's there?

24:54.285 --> 24:55.786
Wanderer?

25:04.003 --> 25:08.167
If you think that I'm
gonna let you take me again...

25:08.383 --> 25:11.250
You are messing
with the wrong Succubus!

25:12.345 --> 25:13.630
(smash)

25:15.306 --> 25:17.171
(growling)

25:37.286 --> 25:38.901
I'm here. I'm here. I'm here.

25:40.123 --> 25:43.115
lgnis adflicto affligo.

25:44.127 --> 25:46.083
I did it! Yes!

25:47.505 --> 25:48.210
Bo, what happened?

25:48.423 --> 25:49.913
Did you see it?

26:05.231 --> 26:07.222
What's happening to me?

26:10.403 --> 26:11.643
This is all my fault.

26:11.863 --> 26:12.898
No, it's not. How
could you have known

26:13.114 --> 26:14.069
what he kept in that cage?

26:14.157 --> 26:14.987
Bo, listen to me...

26:15.074 --> 26:16.063
I'm gonna take care of this.

26:16.284 --> 26:19.651
I owe him! Massimo. A lot.

26:19.871 --> 26:22.658
Okay, and I've been
stealing to pay him.

26:22.874 --> 26:23.329
Kenz.

26:23.541 --> 26:24.576
From Trick.

26:24.792 --> 26:25.121
Kenzi!

26:25.334 --> 26:26.164
And from Hale.

26:26.377 --> 26:27.583
I gave him the Twig of Zamora.

26:27.795 --> 26:30.127
Are you crazy!? Wait, I don't--
I don't know what that is.

26:30.339 --> 26:31.670
And he just-- he keeps
taking and taking

26:31.883 --> 26:34.795
and it's still not enough
for a permanent power.

26:35.011 --> 26:36.342
But I-I had to do something.

26:36.554 --> 26:38.090
Claimed humans
are being taken, Bo!

26:38.306 --> 26:41.890
Hey. I would never
let anyone take you.

26:42.101 --> 26:45.218
Really? Because last I
checked you just got back.

26:48.691 --> 26:52.934
And I am tired
of feeling helpless.

26:53.154 --> 26:55.065
Not able to...

26:55.281 --> 26:56.487
Not able!

26:56.699 --> 26:57.905
Wait, who ever said that?

26:58.117 --> 27:00.699
The Fae! Everybody!

27:00.912 --> 27:02.118
Always reminding me

27:02.330 --> 27:04.992
that I'm weak and I'm
vulnerable and I'm a liability

27:05.208 --> 27:06.664
a-and a thief and...

27:06.876 --> 27:08.457
I kissed Dyson.

27:08.795 --> 27:10.660
What?

27:10.880 --> 27:12.871
I kissed Dyson.

27:15.009 --> 27:16.840
And the worse part is that...

27:17.053 --> 27:20.921
I think I only really
want to kiss Hale.

27:21.140 --> 27:26.225
I think I... love-- like him.

27:26.437 --> 27:29.019
Maybe? I don't even know.

27:29.232 --> 27:30.938
I'm just alone.

27:31.150 --> 27:35.143
No, you are not alone,
Kenzi. You have me.

27:35.363 --> 27:37.900
I have you, I have all of you,
but when it comes down to it

27:38.115 --> 27:40.822
I don't really
have any of you. Do I?

27:47.250 --> 27:50.708
You left me, Bo.

27:50.920 --> 27:52.501
What if you go again?

27:56.133 --> 27:58.715
I was alone.

27:58.928 --> 28:01.761
I belonged nowhere.

28:03.558 --> 28:07.301
As hard as I try,
I'm just not one of you.

28:10.606 --> 28:12.642
Zamora Twigs.

28:12.859 --> 28:14.099
Stealing from Trick.

28:14.318 --> 28:15.478
Kissing Dyson.

28:15.695 --> 28:17.606
I don't even know what
is happening anymore.

28:17.822 --> 28:18.652
Bo--

28:18.865 --> 28:20.856
And of all the things
I'm in the dark about...

28:21.075 --> 28:23.031
I never thought
it would be you.

28:24.579 --> 28:25.568
(phone ringing)

28:25.788 --> 28:27.244
We are not done.

28:29.125 --> 28:30.160
Oh...

28:31.961 --> 28:32.916
Hello Dyson.

28:33.129 --> 28:34.414
Is Tamsin with you?

28:34.630 --> 28:36.746
No, I've been stuck
at Lauren's with Kenzi.

28:36.966 --> 28:38.172
What happened?

28:38.384 --> 28:41.000
I don't know, I guess I
snapped at her. She took off.

28:41.220 --> 28:42.960
What? She's--
She's just a baby,

28:43.180 --> 28:45.091
she doesn't even
know how to twerk yet!

28:45.308 --> 28:47.594
Yeah, well she also suddenly
looks like my old partner

28:47.810 --> 28:49.596
who used to bang
Hydras over lunch.

28:49.812 --> 28:51.052
I'm coming to you.

28:52.648 --> 28:54.764
What else of ours did
you see at Massimo's?

28:54.984 --> 28:55.769
Geraldine.

28:55.985 --> 28:56.349
My hairbrush.

28:56.569 --> 28:57.433
Throw pillows.

28:57.653 --> 28:59.234
Wait-- You used
your brush on Tamsin.

28:59.447 --> 29:01.278
What if he saw her hair in it?

29:01.490 --> 29:03.071
No, girl doesn't
shed a single lock.

29:03.284 --> 29:05.570
Yeah, but he's a druid.
He could have detected her oils.

29:05.786 --> 29:08.573
Plus, his robber
saw a blonde girl.

29:08.789 --> 29:09.995
He knows she's alive.

29:10.207 --> 29:13.699
Yeah, and apparently Valkryie
hair is mad valuable.

29:13.920 --> 29:15.000
Massimo didn't want us dead.

29:15.212 --> 29:16.622
No, he wanted us distracted.

29:16.839 --> 29:18.921
So he could go after
what he really wants.

29:19.133 --> 29:21.249
Who he really wants.

29:21.469 --> 29:22.003
I'm going alone.

29:22.219 --> 29:23.004
No, no, no Bo--

29:23.220 --> 29:24.881
Wait here for Dyson.

29:25.097 --> 29:27.213
You guys are close, right?

29:32.480 --> 29:33.765
(knocking)

29:38.653 --> 29:39.938
Hi Tamsin.

29:41.530 --> 29:43.145
How do you know my name?

29:46.661 --> 29:49.243
Of course you
don't remember me.

29:49.455 --> 29:53.744
But in another life,
we were super close.

30:01.717 --> 30:03.002
You see?

30:08.474 --> 30:10.635
Kenzi and Bo called me.

30:10.851 --> 30:12.716
Wanted me to come pick you up.

30:12.937 --> 30:14.143
You know them?

30:14.355 --> 30:16.016
We are best friends forever.

30:21.529 --> 30:23.941
You're here to
help me aren't you?

30:24.156 --> 30:26.147
It's because I'm hideous?

30:29.036 --> 30:30.151
You're perfect.

30:37.169 --> 30:38.670
Why are you tying me up?

30:38.879 --> 30:39.709
To protect everyone

30:39.922 --> 30:42.163
for when you turn
into your true self.

30:42.383 --> 30:43.964
Ow. My true self?

30:44.176 --> 30:45.461
Uh-hunh.

30:45.678 --> 30:47.794
A monster.

30:48.014 --> 30:49.345
Am I gonna be in trouble?

30:49.557 --> 30:52.173
Oh honey, you are trouble.

30:52.393 --> 30:55.806
You've been playing house
with the Ambiguously Fae Duo.

30:57.023 --> 30:58.433
Bo's unaligned.

30:58.649 --> 31:00.560
Kenzi's temp.

31:00.776 --> 31:06.817
But you... You
are the real deal.

31:08.200 --> 31:09.485
Because I'm Dark?

31:09.702 --> 31:10.987
Exactly!

31:11.203 --> 31:12.579
You're bad.

31:12.788 --> 31:14.653
Oh no, it's in your blood.

31:14.874 --> 31:19.914
And it's only a matter
of time before you...

31:20.129 --> 31:21.835
become a killer.

31:25.384 --> 31:27.249
And that is why you need me.

31:28.512 --> 31:30.048
I kill people?

31:31.766 --> 31:33.631
You tried to kill Bo.

31:33.851 --> 31:35.057
I helped you.

31:35.269 --> 31:36.770
We're a team!

31:38.105 --> 31:39.641
That's why Bo hates me.

31:39.857 --> 31:42.269
Get used to it.
'Cause people like us...

31:45.279 --> 31:47.190
We die alone.

32:08.385 --> 32:09.966
Anh.

32:13.390 --> 32:15.802
Look at that hair.

32:16.018 --> 32:17.849
It's so fine.

32:18.062 --> 32:19.723
It's so young.

32:19.939 --> 32:23.602
I've waited for this for so
long. Now it's finally mine...

32:23.818 --> 32:28.733
And the only way to obtain
a young Valkyrie's hair...

32:28.948 --> 32:30.779
Is to have it
fall out willingly.

32:30.991 --> 32:31.491
Ah!

32:31.700 --> 32:34.692
Never give a woman a
hair cut she doesn't want.

32:39.166 --> 32:40.576
You need to go.

32:41.961 --> 32:43.417
'Cause I'm over you.

32:46.924 --> 32:52.169
TAMSIN: Stop.
Release. Witness.

32:56.684 --> 32:57.719
Holy shit.

32:57.935 --> 32:59.425
That's new.

33:00.604 --> 33:02.105
Not new.

33:02.314 --> 33:03.645
Reborn.

33:06.735 --> 33:07.861
Your Elder is suffering from

33:08.070 --> 33:11.483
a form of spongiform
encephalopathy.

33:11.699 --> 33:13.815
The digestive results show
that he's been feeding off

33:14.034 --> 33:16.992
his own kind. Blood relatives.

33:17.204 --> 33:21.447
He's going... Mad Fae.

33:21.667 --> 33:22.827
Course of treatment:
oh, I don't know,

33:23.043 --> 33:25.500
maybe lay off the
incest a little bit.

33:25.713 --> 33:28.079
And you didn't need to
kidnap me to figure this out.

33:28.299 --> 33:30.381
You just needed to use
your brain for once.

33:30.593 --> 33:35.883
Because this...
is child's play!

33:36.098 --> 33:37.679
So here's what's gonna happen.

33:37.892 --> 33:41.726
I'm gonna agree to treat
your disgusting Elder

33:41.937 --> 33:43.347
and you're going
to release Crystal

33:43.564 --> 33:45.395
before she goes into
anaphylactic shock

33:45.608 --> 33:48.566
from a nickel allergy, due
to your antiquated handcuffs.

33:48.777 --> 33:50.904
Oh, and these! By the way...

33:53.449 --> 33:54.814
Are child's play.

33:55.034 --> 33:58.652
Your not-quite-girlfriend,
Kenzi...

34:00.789 --> 34:02.700
taught me how to pick a lock.

34:05.294 --> 34:09.879
So... Hm? Did I pass
your ridiculous test?

34:10.090 --> 34:14.003
Because if I did, you
can come on out, Hale.

34:23.687 --> 34:27.179
You're not... Hale.

34:33.781 --> 34:35.487
I'm the harbinger of death.

34:35.699 --> 34:38.156
I arrive on winds of blessed air.

34:38.369 --> 34:40.360
Air that you no longer deserve.

34:42.206 --> 34:43.070
Please.

34:44.833 --> 34:46.209
Tamsin.

34:46.418 --> 34:48.079
Lil' T.

34:48.295 --> 34:49.876
I know you want to kill him.

34:50.089 --> 34:52.421
So do I, believe me.
But he's not worth it.

34:52.633 --> 34:53.497
I kill.

34:53.717 --> 34:55.093
I'm Dark, remember?

34:55.302 --> 34:56.337
You don't have to.

34:56.553 --> 34:58.930
You can be whoever
you want to be.

34:59.139 --> 35:00.219
You're lying!

35:00.432 --> 35:01.968
You despise me.

35:04.061 --> 35:08.270
Okay, you know
what, you're right.

35:08.482 --> 35:13.067
You and I, we fought
in your past life.

35:13.279 --> 35:15.361
You weren't
always my favourite.

35:15.572 --> 35:16.903
You rubbed me the wrong way.

35:17.116 --> 35:18.902
You, uh, could be
a real close talker.

35:19.118 --> 35:22.155
But I never hated you.

35:24.790 --> 35:29.625
In fact, I thought
you were incredible.

35:45.561 --> 35:47.893
That's what love feels like.

35:48.105 --> 35:51.643
No one fights with
my roommates but me.

35:53.819 --> 35:58.483
Now, go to the
elevator close your eyes.

35:58.699 --> 36:00.439
Turn the music
up real loud, okay?

36:09.209 --> 36:12.417
Wow. Did you see that?

36:12.629 --> 36:16.713
I mean, if you thought
she was powerful before. Woo.

36:16.925 --> 36:18.256
She just got her wings.

36:18.469 --> 36:19.834
Do you know what that means?

36:20.054 --> 36:22.295
Monthly cramps. Bloating.

36:22.514 --> 36:24.015
This is her last life.

36:24.224 --> 36:27.057
So I guess that means
you just saved mine.

36:27.269 --> 36:29.635
I don't let children
do my dirty work.

36:29.855 --> 36:31.891
Especially after
someone sends gargoyles

36:32.107 --> 36:33.187
after me to do theirs.

36:33.400 --> 36:34.059
What gargoyles?

36:34.276 --> 36:35.561
I'm not falling for this.

36:35.778 --> 36:36.563
No, really.

36:36.779 --> 36:38.644
Gargoyles serve
a higher authority.

36:38.864 --> 36:41.025
They attack whoever
threatened their masters.

36:42.951 --> 36:46.535
Hah, so I guess
we're even now.

36:46.747 --> 36:47.953
Not even close.

36:55.839 --> 36:58.251
That's how you got into
our house past the rim.

36:58.467 --> 36:59.798
You're human.

37:01.929 --> 37:03.635
I am The Druid.

37:03.847 --> 37:07.010
All right, your desperate,
pathetic people, you seek me.

37:07.226 --> 37:08.887
You need me.

37:09.103 --> 37:10.388
You will respect me.

37:10.604 --> 37:11.935
Oh, respect?

37:12.147 --> 37:15.230
You think you can just
take whatever you want?

37:16.652 --> 37:19.064
Go near Tamsin and
Kenzi one more time.

37:21.824 --> 37:23.109
I dare you.

37:26.453 --> 37:28.444
But you're Fae.

37:28.664 --> 37:29.699
Kenzi'sjust human.

37:29.915 --> 37:33.703
No. She is family.

37:43.804 --> 37:45.920
No y-you need
to give that back.

37:46.140 --> 37:47.471
How about we make a deal?

37:47.683 --> 37:50.095
Oh, you are out of deals.

37:50.310 --> 37:52.562
And I am out of patience.

37:52.771 --> 37:54.386
Give it to me!

38:00.279 --> 38:02.691
Just give it.

38:02.906 --> 38:04.316
Are you crying right now?

38:04.533 --> 38:05.898
Over hair?

38:07.453 --> 38:12.868
My mommy, she needs it.

38:13.083 --> 38:15.415
And I need her to need me.

38:15.627 --> 38:16.707
Mommy issues? Get in line.

38:16.920 --> 38:18.421
Please.

38:21.925 --> 38:25.167
You are one hot mess.

38:25.387 --> 38:27.048
And speaking of hot...

38:27.723 --> 38:28.929
No!

38:29.141 --> 38:29.550
Debt's settled.

38:29.766 --> 38:30.972
Nice knowing you.

38:31.185 --> 38:33.676
Now I need to go get it.

38:44.573 --> 38:46.234
No! Massimo no!

39:05.177 --> 39:07.384
I'm not mad about Dyson.

39:07.596 --> 39:08.221
It meant nothing.

39:08.430 --> 39:09.545
I know.

39:13.519 --> 39:16.727
That druid potion
that marked me?

39:16.939 --> 39:18.395
That I apparently sealed?

39:18.607 --> 39:20.393
It needed to be
a kiss from someone

39:20.609 --> 39:21.769
who would never betray me...

39:21.985 --> 39:22.735
But I did!

39:22.945 --> 39:24.560
No! Listen.

39:24.780 --> 39:32.403
You and me, we were on
our own for a very long time.

39:32.621 --> 39:34.077
But we found each other.

39:37.501 --> 39:40.584
And there will be
times when we fight.

39:42.005 --> 39:43.336
Because we are family.

39:43.549 --> 39:46.131
But family sticks together.

39:46.343 --> 39:49.426
Yeah, even when we screw up.

39:58.438 --> 40:00.303
I'm so glad you're back.

40:00.524 --> 40:02.890
And I'm done being helpless.

40:04.194 --> 40:06.401
I am done being scared.

40:06.613 --> 40:07.773
We all are.

40:09.408 --> 40:13.242
...and then the evil beast
threatened to cut her hair.

40:13.453 --> 40:16.911
That made the
princess very angry.

40:17.124 --> 40:21.117
And she grew beautiful,
magical wings.

40:21.336 --> 40:23.668
And she swooped down,
and she picked up the monster

40:23.880 --> 40:28.590
by his ears, and she flew
him to a far, far away land.

40:28.802 --> 40:31.589
Where he would
never hurt anyone.

40:31.805 --> 40:33.341
Ever again.

40:35.309 --> 40:36.469
Shh.

40:36.685 --> 40:40.553
Oh, geeze, give a girl
a little warning, will ya.

40:41.481 --> 40:42.641
The inner sanctum.

40:42.858 --> 40:44.894
And all this time I thought
you slept in the bathtub.

40:45.110 --> 40:47.817
No, only after All-You-Can-
Eat-Rib-Tuesdays.

41:04.504 --> 41:06.916
You know you can
do anything, right?

41:07.924 --> 41:09.789
Inaccurate.

41:10.010 --> 41:11.420
Not really.

41:12.763 --> 41:16.881
You don't have to be
Fae to have a place among us.

41:17.100 --> 41:19.557
There is a way
for you to be more.

41:22.481 --> 41:24.096
I can teach you.

41:25.233 --> 41:27.519
It's about time,
don't you think?

41:27.736 --> 41:28.521
Yeah!

41:28.737 --> 41:30.773
Totally!

41:32.282 --> 41:33.397
What?

41:34.576 --> 41:37.568
When the time
is right, I promise.

41:39.706 --> 41:42.573
Look at you Wolf Man.

41:44.336 --> 41:47.419
Inspiring up all
the kids n' shit.

41:51.301 --> 41:52.507
Kenzi...

41:55.889 --> 41:57.299
I've lost Lauren.

41:59.184 --> 42:01.721
And I think she's in danger.

42:01.937 --> 42:03.643
I have to find her.

42:18.036 --> 42:19.412
Nice touch.

42:20.122 --> 42:22.784
Nothing like a little
home decor with bite.

42:25.877 --> 42:27.413
Tough crowd.

42:28.630 --> 42:30.746
Also, moist.

42:30.966 --> 42:32.672
You ever considered
a dehumidifier?

42:32.884 --> 42:35.375
You have not been summoned
to appear before us.

42:37.431 --> 42:39.717
Here's a little something
that you should know.

42:41.017 --> 42:43.474
No one summons me.

42:43.687 --> 42:46.929
I go where I want, when I want.

42:47.149 --> 42:50.562
And if something
tries to hurt me...

42:50.777 --> 42:52.768
I deal with it.

42:54.448 --> 42:57.611
I don't live by your rules.

42:57.826 --> 43:00.738
I will never
live by your rules.

43:00.954 --> 43:03.240
And if you want
to kill me for that?

43:04.624 --> 43:06.034
Try.

43:07.169 --> 43:09.956
We are not interested
in your proposal.

43:10.172 --> 43:13.585
Our intention was to eliminate
the unaligned Succubus.

43:13.800 --> 43:14.550
Uh, yeah.

43:14.760 --> 43:15.875
Over here.

43:16.094 --> 43:17.709
Your blood has spoken.

43:17.929 --> 43:19.635
You have chosen a side.

43:27.189 --> 43:28.224
What side?

43:30.442 --> 43:31.852
You are Dark.
