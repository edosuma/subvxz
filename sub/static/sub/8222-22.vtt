WEBVTT

00:01.201 --> 00:02.429
Attention, viewers.

00:02.502 --> 00:04.834
Do not try anything you are
about to see at home.

00:04.904 --> 00:07.873
We're what you call
experts.

00:07.941 --> 00:11.468
On this episode
of "Mythbusters,"

00:11.544 --> 00:13.978
Adam and Jamie
go on a grime wave

00:14.047 --> 00:17.039
with two
frightfully filthy fables.

00:17.117 --> 00:18.812
That is nasty.

00:18.885 --> 00:20.546
<i>First, they call in
the rat pack.</i>

00:20.620 --> 00:22.679
Oh, I see some rat urine
on a can.

00:22.756 --> 00:27.056
For the terrible tale that rat
pee on a pop can can kill.

00:27.127 --> 00:28.719
Oh, this one
is so gross!

00:28.795 --> 00:30.387
Then they test the myth

00:30.463 --> 00:33.330
that everyday items are dirtier
than your toilet seat.

00:33.400 --> 00:35.368
Mary had a little lamb.

00:35.435 --> 00:38.233
Its fleece was white as snow.

00:38.304 --> 00:41.102
<i>Meanwhile, Jessi, Tory,
and Grant cut to the chase...</i>

00:41.174 --> 00:43.904
Why'd you stop?
You were supposed to skip it.

00:43.977 --> 00:47.469
<i>...as they find out
if a souped-up supercar...</i>

00:47.547 --> 00:49.105
That's a fast car!

00:49.182 --> 00:52.447
<i>...can bounce across the surface
of a lake like a skipping stone.</i>

00:52.519 --> 00:53.781
We're like
Thelma and Louise!

00:59.793 --> 01:02.523
Who are the Mythbusters?

01:02.595 --> 01:03.789
Adam Savage...

01:05.098 --> 01:05.928
...and Jamie Hyneman.

01:05.999 --> 01:07.899
Relax.
This won't hurt a bit.

01:07.967 --> 01:12.267
Between them, more than 30 years
of special-effects experience.

01:12.338 --> 01:15.501
Joining them...
Tory Belleci...

01:17.577 --> 01:19.101
...Grant Imahara...

01:19.179 --> 01:20.305
We're good to go.

01:20.380 --> 01:21.404
...Kari Byron...

01:21.481 --> 01:22.675
That is terrifying!

01:22.749 --> 01:24.774
...and featuring
Jessi Combs.

01:24.851 --> 01:27.115
This is gonna be so rad!

01:27.187 --> 01:29.747
They don't just tell
the myths.

01:29.823 --> 01:33.350
They put them to the test.

01:35.000 --> 01:41.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:48.041 --> 01:49.702
What do you got there,

01:49.776 --> 01:52.210
a story
about very small things?

01:52.278 --> 01:53.370
Yep.

01:53.446 --> 01:55.971
We're talking about millions
of tiny organisms

01:56.049 --> 01:58.244
that you come into contact with
every day.

01:58.318 --> 02:00.786
But some of them could have
a nasty surprise waiting for you

02:00.854 --> 02:02.287
and be really harmful.

02:02.355 --> 02:04.448
I got one
that fits that bill.

02:04.524 --> 02:06.583
I got
a chain letter recently

02:06.659 --> 02:10.823
that stated a woman had died
from a deadly pathogen

02:10.896 --> 02:13.991
she contracted drinking
from a soda can

02:14.067 --> 02:16.695
tainted with rat urine.

02:16.769 --> 02:18.862
That's exactly
what I'm talking about.

02:18.938 --> 02:19.927
Well, let's get to it.

02:20.006 --> 02:21.496
Okay.

02:21.574 --> 02:24.668
Wherever there are rats,
filth follows.

02:24.744 --> 02:28.612
But are soda cans really
contaminated by rat pee?

02:28.681 --> 02:33.744
And, if they are, could drinking
directly from the can be deadly?

02:33.820 --> 02:36.687
So, how do you want to
test this?

02:36.756 --> 02:39.020
Well, you know,
this myth is so pervasive,

02:39.092 --> 02:40.354
we need to get it right.

02:40.426 --> 02:43.827
And that means we need to have
a nice, large sample size.

02:43.897 --> 02:45.228
Okay.

02:45.298 --> 02:47.493
And I think we should start
with a positive pee control

02:47.567 --> 02:49.296
so that we know
what rat urine looks like,

02:49.369 --> 02:50.427
we know how to test for it,

02:50.503 --> 02:52.767
we know how to know
when it's there.

02:52.839 --> 02:56.400
And we need to just get
a whole passel of rats,

02:56.476 --> 02:57.773
a bunch of cans,

02:57.844 --> 02:59.778
and let nature
take its course, huh?

02:59.846 --> 03:02.076
Is "passel" the collective noun
for rats?

03:02.148 --> 03:04.082
I don't know.

03:04.150 --> 03:09.247
Well, actually, it's a horde,
swarm, rabble, or pack of rats.

03:09.322 --> 03:10.346
But before they get started...

03:10.423 --> 03:11.788
But I don't understand.

03:11.858 --> 03:14.691
How is it possible
that rat pee could kill you?

03:14.761 --> 03:17.696
Yes, it's not rat pee itself
that could kill you.

03:17.764 --> 03:20.756
It's the fact that rat pee
could potentially carry

03:20.833 --> 03:22.926
both leptospirosis
and hantavirus

03:23.002 --> 03:25.266
that makes it
potentially dangerous.

03:25.338 --> 03:27.101
I see.

03:27.173 --> 03:28.606
According to this myth,

03:28.675 --> 03:32.543
deadly pathogens transfer
from rat through rat urine

03:32.612 --> 03:35.638
to soda can,
and from there, to people.

03:35.715 --> 03:38.843
So first, they're starting
with a positive control.

03:38.918 --> 03:42.877
Now, normally, we certify our
tasty, tasty Mythbusters cola

03:42.956 --> 03:46.289
as both a life-extending elixir
and rat-pee free.

03:46.359 --> 03:47.326
Until today.

03:47.393 --> 03:49.327
Today, 1,000 of these puppies

03:49.395 --> 03:51.522
are gonna be set up as a rat run

03:51.598 --> 03:54.658
to be used as what we like
to call a control

03:54.734 --> 03:56.361
for exposure to rat pee.

03:56.436 --> 04:00.065
<i>Adam and Jamie will hone their
rat-pee-tracking technique</i>

04:00.139 --> 04:03.905
before moving on
to test real-world soda cans.

04:03.977 --> 04:06.309
So, why go to all this trouble
to clean the cans

04:06.379 --> 04:07.971
just to have rats
pee on them?

04:08.047 --> 04:11.016
Well, it's because all we want
to find is rat pee,

04:11.084 --> 04:13.644
not random dirt
or other false positives

04:13.720 --> 04:16.120
that may be introduced
into our test.

04:16.189 --> 04:17.884
So, we scrub
every single one.

04:17.957 --> 04:20.517
And I got to say,
looking at 1,000 cans,

04:20.593 --> 04:22.618
there's a lot of dirt
to be cleaned up.

04:22.695 --> 04:24.390
Now that the cans
are pristine,

04:24.464 --> 04:27.194
let the rodent
incontinence begin.

04:27.267 --> 04:29.462
Oh, I see some rat urine
on a can.

04:29.535 --> 04:30.934
Nice!

04:31.004 --> 04:32.062
This is awesome.

04:32.138 --> 04:33.730
This is one of those sounds

04:33.806 --> 04:35.706
that you'll only hear
on "Mythbusters"...

04:35.775 --> 04:38.369
the sound of 40 rats
on 1,000 cans.

04:42.915 --> 04:46.715
<i>And after 90 minutes of the
pitter-patter of ratty feet...</i>

04:47.720 --> 04:49.244
The rat party
is wrapped.

04:50.390 --> 04:52.017
Let's put them back
in their cages.

04:52.091 --> 04:54.616
There's certainly rat pee
on those cans.

04:54.694 --> 04:57.629
And the first tracking
technique... black light.

04:57.697 --> 05:00.427
Did you know that rat pee
fluoresces under black light?

05:01.601 --> 05:03.228
That's the next thing
we're gonna do.

05:03.303 --> 05:05.168
Get some black lights
and go take a look for 'em.

05:06.606 --> 05:09.700
I feel like I'm in one of those
police procedural dramas.

05:09.776 --> 05:12.404
<i>And with plenty
of glowing puddles...</i>

05:12.478 --> 05:14.173
It's got to be urine.

05:14.247 --> 05:16.147
Lights up
like a pinball machine.

05:16.215 --> 05:18.183
Oh!
This one is so gross!

05:18.251 --> 05:19.582
Look at that!

05:20.820 --> 05:22.947
...the boys are positive
that the black light

05:23.022 --> 05:26.423
is the perfect way
to pinpoint the pee.

05:26.492 --> 05:27.789
Well, that's gross.

05:27.860 --> 05:31.227
I guess it's time to collect our
real-world random samples now.

05:31.297 --> 05:32.992
Well, we better get started.

05:33.066 --> 05:36.467
We've got 1,000 cans to collect
from all over the city.

05:36.536 --> 05:38.299
1,000.
Okay, let's do it.

05:38.371 --> 05:41.636
With their identification method
lighting up the pee,

05:41.708 --> 05:43.141
the main test begins

05:43.209 --> 05:47.305
as the guys collect 1,000 cans
from a variety of sources,

05:47.380 --> 05:49.940
and a variety
of storage conditions...

05:50.016 --> 05:53.816
some upmarket,
some, uh... not so much.

05:53.886 --> 05:55.046
All set?

05:58.358 --> 06:00.121
Ooh.

06:00.193 --> 06:03.128
Uh, check this out, man.

06:03.196 --> 06:07.064
First can, I see little
fluorescing spotty spots.

06:07.133 --> 06:08.157
That's a good sign.

06:08.234 --> 06:10.600
I'm gonna put that in...
no, it's a bad sign!

06:10.670 --> 06:13.571
I'm gonna put it in the
"for further research" category.

06:13.639 --> 06:16.301
A sign that gets worse
with every can.

06:16.376 --> 06:17.365
Spots.

06:17.443 --> 06:18.375
Ooh.

06:18.444 --> 06:19.934
Ugh, spots.

06:20.012 --> 06:22.412
The whole world
is contaminated!

06:22.482 --> 06:24.279
Spots.

06:24.350 --> 06:26.284
What are we gonna do,
dude?

06:26.352 --> 06:31.585
I mean, these can't be
all contaminated, can they?

06:34.660 --> 06:39.461
<i>Next, a myth
that's sink or "skim. "</i>

06:40.700 --> 06:42.292
Well, you guys
may have figured out by now

06:42.368 --> 06:44.859
that, well, me and cars,
we kind of have this thing.

06:44.937 --> 06:46.837
And there's a myth on the fan
site that I really want to test out.

06:46.906 --> 06:48.271
All right, what is it?

06:48.341 --> 06:49.672
Are you familiar
with the "Cannonball" films?

06:49.742 --> 06:51.642
Sure.
From the '80s, right?

06:51.711 --> 06:53.679
Okay, so, it's the third installment that
our myth comes from.

06:53.746 --> 06:55.213
The beginning of the movie,
there's a red Lamborghini

06:55.281 --> 06:56.680
that is trying to evade
the cops.

06:56.749 --> 06:58.307
Well,
there's a lot of speeding

06:58.384 --> 06:59.817
and a lot of weaving
and trickery.

06:59.886 --> 07:02.684
But, man, the cops are not
going to accept defeat.

07:02.755 --> 07:04.746
So what the sports-car driver
does is he drives off the road

07:04.824 --> 07:06.121
and heads straight
towards the lake.

07:06.192 --> 07:08.057
He totally floors it,
skips across the water,

07:08.127 --> 07:10.823
makes it to the other side,
and gets away from the cops.

07:10.897 --> 07:12.330
...Exactly.
... I love it.

07:12.398 --> 07:14.127
Fast car
skipping across the water?

07:14.200 --> 07:15.827
You should come here
more often.

07:17.570 --> 07:19.800
<i>To flee the force,</i>

07:19.872 --> 07:23.808
a speedy sports car
skips the lake fantastic.

07:23.876 --> 07:27.972
But is this filming fantasy
or stone-fold fact?

07:28.047 --> 07:29.742
Could a 1.2-ton car

07:29.816 --> 07:32.785
really skim a pond
like a skipping stone?

07:32.852 --> 07:34.319
So, what's the plan?

07:34.387 --> 07:37.447
I have watched the scene
over and over in slow motion,

07:37.523 --> 07:38.785
and what I have found,

07:38.858 --> 07:40.291
that by watching
frame by frame

07:40.359 --> 07:41.883
and measuring points
of reference,

07:41.961 --> 07:43.826
the car wasn't going very
fast... maybe 50 miles an hour.

07:43.896 --> 07:45.693
It went off
a little launch

07:45.765 --> 07:49.724
and skipped about four times
over a 100-foot body of water.

07:49.802 --> 07:51.394
Okay,
sounds easy enough.

07:51.471 --> 07:54.099
We get a Lamborghini,
drive it at 50 miles an hour,

07:54.173 --> 07:56.903
and see if it can skip
across 100 feet of water.

07:56.976 --> 08:00.139
Who is gonna let us borrow their
$250,000 car

08:00.213 --> 08:01.771
and drive into a lake
to test this?

08:01.848 --> 08:03.247
I mean,
it's not gonna happen.

08:03.316 --> 08:04.578
This isn't
gonna be easy.

08:04.650 --> 08:06.083
<i>No, it's not.</i>

08:06.152 --> 08:08.712
But although you can't always
get what you want,

08:08.788 --> 08:10.653
sometimes,
you get what you need.

08:12.358 --> 08:13.985
What in the heck
did she get that for?

08:14.060 --> 08:15.789
That doesn't look like
a Lamborghini.

08:15.862 --> 08:17.295
Yeah, far from it.

08:17.363 --> 08:21.800
Supercar it ain't, but it's
still a perfect stunt stand-in.

08:21.868 --> 08:26.134
On price tag and top speed,
the luxury car has ours beat.

08:26.205 --> 08:28.696
But for this myth,
what's key is that

08:28.774 --> 08:31.902
the surface area, weight,
and weight distribution

08:31.978 --> 08:33.342
are almost identical.

08:33.412 --> 08:35.744
But because nobody
is volunteering

08:35.815 --> 08:37.339
to drive it into a lake,

08:37.416 --> 08:41.113
our resident control geek
gets to work.

08:41.187 --> 08:43.280
I got a plan.
I got a plan.

08:43.356 --> 08:46.848
<i>With Grant's
remote control under control,</i>

08:46.926 --> 08:48.416
Tory's talking tracks.

08:48.494 --> 08:51.429
Now, for this myth as well as
the car, we need two things.

08:51.497 --> 08:53.362
One, we need
a long, straight road

08:53.432 --> 08:56.162
that we can get this car up
to some pretty high speeds.

08:56.235 --> 08:57.998
And two,
at the end of that road,

08:58.070 --> 09:01.005
we need a 100-foot pond for
this car to try to skip across.

09:01.073 --> 09:03.200
Now, we've looked
all over San Francisco.

09:03.276 --> 09:05.039
We've looked all over
California.

09:05.111 --> 09:07.011
And we've come up with nothing,

09:07.079 --> 09:10.048
which means only one thing...
road trip, baby.

09:10.116 --> 09:13.017
Wouldn't it have been easier
if we could fly?

09:13.085 --> 09:16.077
<i>With local lakes
few and far between,</i>

09:16.155 --> 09:19.124
the team hits the road
to a familiar location.

09:21.160 --> 09:23.958
The last time the team visited
the test track of Freightliner,

09:24.030 --> 09:27.591
they put some big-rig myths
to the test.

09:27.667 --> 09:30.636
With open space
and miles of trackway,

09:30.703 --> 09:34.571
it was the perfect place to
put their lives on the... what?

09:36.442 --> 09:38.603
And this time, they've added
a crucial addition

09:38.678 --> 09:42.580
to the end of the track...
a giant purpose-built pond

09:42.648 --> 09:44.741
ideal for a sports car to skip.

09:44.817 --> 09:47.650
Only not this one.
This is just for show.

09:48.955 --> 09:51.423
Why'd you stop?
We're supposed to skip it.

09:51.490 --> 09:54.618
Yeah, but that's why we have
make-believe Lamborghinis.

09:54.694 --> 09:56.594
Where did you get that car?

09:56.662 --> 09:58.061
Well, a good friend
let me borrow it.

09:58.130 --> 10:00.098
Forget the car.
What do you think about our pond?

10:00.166 --> 10:01.360
This is a gorgeous pond.

10:01.434 --> 10:03.163
It's a little bit bigger
than I thought it was gonna be.

10:03.235 --> 10:05.760
Yeah, we made it to the same
dimensions as in the movie...

10:05.838 --> 10:08.602
100 feet long, 27 feet wide,
and 3 feet deep.

10:08.674 --> 10:11.234
<i>Yep,
with a perfect pond to skim,</i>

10:11.310 --> 10:14.245
Tory and Jessi break out
the heavy machinery.

10:14.313 --> 10:15.678
All right,
so now what we're doing here

10:15.748 --> 10:17.716
is we are building a little ramp

10:17.783 --> 10:19.045
before we actually
hit the water.

10:19.118 --> 10:21.450
Why? Because that's
what they had in the movie.

10:21.520 --> 10:23.818
We can look at it as close
as we possibly can,

10:23.889 --> 10:26.119
and that Lamborghini
had a little bit of lift

10:26.192 --> 10:27.887
before it went
across the water.

10:27.960 --> 10:31.327
<i>A little lift that equates to a
movie-matching 8-inch mound.</i>

10:31.397 --> 10:33.490
With that time-lapsed
into place,

10:33.566 --> 10:35.727
Jessi casts the first stone.

10:35.801 --> 10:37.928
Now, this whole myth
is about skipping a car

10:38.004 --> 10:39.403
across the water like a stone.

10:39.472 --> 10:40.530
I'm sure you've all
tried it before.

10:40.606 --> 10:43.473
If you get a smooth enough stone
and you fling it just right,

10:43.542 --> 10:45.806
it'll actually bounce
across the water surface.

10:45.878 --> 10:47.368
But why?

10:47.446 --> 10:49.209
Well, it's all about
spin and speed.

10:49.281 --> 10:50.976
The spin of the stone
stabilizes it

10:51.050 --> 10:53.280
and stops it from simply
falling into the water.

10:53.352 --> 10:55.820
And if the stone is traveling
at a fast enough speed,

10:55.888 --> 10:58.618
then each time it hits the water
surface and pushes some

10:58.691 --> 11:01.216
of the water downwards,
the stone is forced upwards,

11:01.293 --> 11:03.454
so the stone continues
to skip along the surface

11:03.529 --> 11:06.327
until, eventually,
it runs out of speed and sinks.

11:06.399 --> 11:09.459
<i>So if skimming
is all down to spin and speed,</i>

11:09.535 --> 11:12.470
will a car
that isn't revolving skip?

11:12.538 --> 11:15.598
There's something that doesn't
look quite right with this car.

11:15.675 --> 11:17.074
It doesn't look fast enough.

11:22.715 --> 11:24.478
That's a fast car.

11:24.550 --> 11:27.917
We are ready to find out
if this car is gonna skip.

11:29.155 --> 11:30.622
Is it gonna work?

11:30.690 --> 11:31.918
Probably not.

11:31.991 --> 11:34.926
What I think is gonna happen
is it might skip once.

11:34.994 --> 11:36.655
Maybe. Probably not.
Probably not.

11:36.729 --> 11:38.856
It's not gonna make it
to the end, either way.

11:38.931 --> 11:41.365
<i>Well, all
is about to be revealed.</i>

11:41.434 --> 11:43.800
As Jessi heads
to her vantage point,

11:43.869 --> 11:46.167
a clearly excited Grant
starts the engines.

11:46.238 --> 11:48.206
The car is on!

11:48.274 --> 11:49.400
This is it, you guys!

11:49.475 --> 11:51.568
And Tory gives the countdown.

11:51.644 --> 11:54.112
The car skip
just like in the movie.

11:54.180 --> 11:55.112
Here we go.

11:55.181 --> 11:57.775
In 3, 2, 1.

11:57.850 --> 11:58.942
Hit it.

12:03.622 --> 12:05.089
<i>Dirty rats!</i>

12:05.157 --> 12:06.522
They're everywhere.

12:06.592 --> 12:08.457
But are these crafty rodents

12:08.527 --> 12:12.190
leaving disease-ridden
calling cards on soda cans?

12:12.264 --> 12:16.633
Well, after examining 1,000 cans
from all over San Francisco...

12:16.702 --> 12:18.101
I'm starting to lose
my appetite.

12:18.170 --> 12:20.035
...Adam and Jamie
are worried.

12:20.106 --> 12:22.040
So where does this leave us?

12:22.108 --> 12:24.838
Am I lying on a mountain
of rat-pee-infested cans?

12:24.910 --> 12:28.243
Are we gonna need to add it as
an ingredient on every soda can?

12:28.314 --> 12:29.338
Or...

12:29.415 --> 12:31.406
Did we just happen to see

12:31.484 --> 12:33.782
a bunch of other
run-of-the-mill things

12:33.853 --> 12:35.252
that happen to fluoresce
under black light?

12:35.321 --> 12:37.346
Well, the only way
we're gonna know

12:37.423 --> 12:39.789
is by taking testing
to another level.

12:39.859 --> 12:41.918
Clearly, we need to swab the top
of our sample

12:41.994 --> 12:43.120
and take it to a lab

12:43.195 --> 12:45.629
and find out what's
on top of them for sure.

12:45.698 --> 12:46.960
<i>First up</i>

12:47.032 --> 12:49.660
is the rat-pee-positive
1,000-can control.

12:49.735 --> 12:51.464
I'll tell you one thing...

12:51.537 --> 12:55.132
I am never letting my rats
play on my soda cans again.

12:55.207 --> 12:56.902
The things you learn
on this show.

12:56.976 --> 13:00.207
Using a sterile swab
dipped in sterile water,

13:00.279 --> 13:04.340
each can is swabbed, and then
a vacuum extracts the sample.

13:04.416 --> 13:05.849
I got to tell you.

13:05.918 --> 13:09.149
This may be boring,
and it may be painful,

13:09.221 --> 13:10.950
but it's also really cool.

13:11.023 --> 13:14.356
Yeah, this is so much fun
I can hardly stand it.

13:15.928 --> 13:17.361
Oh! Oh-ho-ho-ho!

13:17.429 --> 13:20.830
Oh, it's like a concentrated
pet store.

13:20.900 --> 13:23.130
That's what that
smells like.

13:24.737 --> 13:26.671
<i>The lab should show
that their positive control</i>

13:26.739 --> 13:28.604
is brimming with rat pee.

13:28.674 --> 13:32.337
But will the random cans
also have rodent remains,

13:32.411 --> 13:34.402
or did the black light
get it wrong?

13:34.480 --> 13:36.948
You got to try the one-handed
bag-opening can flip

13:37.016 --> 13:38.711
I got going on over here,
Jamie.

13:38.784 --> 13:40.081
It's really saving me time.

13:42.388 --> 13:44.754
I can see that.

13:46.625 --> 13:49.560
That is my last can.

13:49.628 --> 13:51.220
I'm done.
I'll see you later.

13:51.297 --> 13:52.525
Okay.

13:52.598 --> 13:54.657
<i>Eventually,
with both samples collected,</i>

13:54.733 --> 13:57.327
the Mythbusters
head to Stanford University...

13:57.403 --> 13:59.871
...Thank you, sir.
... You're welcome.

13:59.939 --> 14:02.840
...where Chris Adams
and his mass spectrometer

14:02.908 --> 14:06.207
find out
just how the two compare.

14:06.278 --> 14:08.337
This meticulous machine

14:08.414 --> 14:11.406
will detect exactly
what each sample contains...

14:11.483 --> 14:13.781
rat pee or otherwise.

14:13.853 --> 14:15.218
The results are in.

14:15.287 --> 14:17.755
...We're done?
... The results are here.

14:17.823 --> 14:20.257
<i>First up
is the positive control.</i>

14:20.326 --> 14:23.784
We identified 15 proteins
specific to rat urine

14:23.863 --> 14:26.354
in the positive control
samples.

14:26.432 --> 14:29.026
Urinary proteins.
That would be rat pee.

14:29.101 --> 14:30.534
...That's rat pee.
... Okay.

14:30.603 --> 14:32.400
But what about...

14:32.471 --> 14:33.836
...the reason we're here?

14:33.906 --> 14:36.500
Yeah, was there any urine
on the random sample?

14:36.575 --> 14:38.634
Absolutely none detected.

14:38.711 --> 14:40.474
The real-world cans
are clean!

14:40.546 --> 14:41.535
They are!

14:41.614 --> 14:44.276
That is a load
off my mind.

14:44.350 --> 14:46.045
Let's go get
some sodas.

14:46.118 --> 14:49.178
<i>Turns out
the black light had it wrong.</i>

14:49.255 --> 14:50.984
That glowing organic matter?

14:51.056 --> 14:54.457
Not rat pee, but harmless dust.

14:54.526 --> 14:57.359
The mass spectrometer, however,
is completely precise.

14:57.429 --> 15:00.398
This machine is capable
of detecting peptides

15:00.466 --> 15:01.831
on a femtomole level.

15:01.901 --> 15:04.233
Something like one
in a bazillion.

15:04.303 --> 15:07.272
Or, in other words,
it's extremely sensitive.

15:07.339 --> 15:10.672
So if it says rat urine's
not there, it ain't there.

15:10.743 --> 15:13.678
<i>But, given that millions
of sodas are drunk every day,</i>

15:13.746 --> 15:17.011
Jamie's not prepared to call
this without a second opinion.

15:17.082 --> 15:20.108
He wants to find out
if you could ever contract

15:20.185 --> 15:23.313
a deadly pathogen
via a soda can.

15:23.389 --> 15:24.549
So, how likely is it

15:24.623 --> 15:26.614
you could catch
one of these bugs in this way?

15:26.692 --> 15:27.716
Highly unlikely.

15:27.793 --> 15:29.351
In the case of leptospirosis,
number one,

15:29.428 --> 15:32.488
the usual route of transmission
is through broken skin

15:32.564 --> 15:35.465
that comes in contact with
contaminated bodies of water.

15:35.534 --> 15:38.162
Number two, the organism,
when ingested orally,

15:38.237 --> 15:40.205
is rapidly killed
in the stomach.

15:40.272 --> 15:42.934
So, finally,
leptospira is highly fragile,

15:43.008 --> 15:44.839
and it is rapidly killed

15:44.910 --> 15:48.107
when it's exposed
to a dried environment.

15:48.180 --> 15:52.879
<i>So even if infected urine
did make it onto a soda can,</i>

15:52.952 --> 15:57.013
the pathogen would be long dead
before anyone took a swig.

15:57.589 --> 15:58.886
Hey, so what'd he say?

15:58.958 --> 16:00.823
Well, according
to the good doctor,

16:00.893 --> 16:03.361
catching hantavirus
or leptospirosis

16:03.429 --> 16:06.557
from rat pee on soda cans
is all but impossible.

16:06.632 --> 16:07.564
Well, that's great.

16:07.633 --> 16:09.328
You couple that
with our results

16:09.401 --> 16:11.995
where we found not a smidgen
of rat protein whatsoever

16:12.071 --> 16:13.766
on 1,000 randomly
collected cans,

16:13.839 --> 16:15.704
and I think we can
call this one...

16:15.774 --> 16:17.833
Busted.

16:17.910 --> 16:21.004
Yeah, busted.

16:27.119 --> 16:29.587
<i>Usually, when a car
drives into water,</i>

16:29.655 --> 16:32.215
it does anything but skip.

16:32.291 --> 16:33.883
But according to this myth,

16:33.959 --> 16:38.521
a supercar can leap a lake
in four bounds.

16:38.597 --> 16:40.963
And at Freightliner H.Q.,

16:41.033 --> 16:43.524
our intrepid trio is about
to put that to the test.

16:43.602 --> 16:44.626
The car is on.

16:44.703 --> 16:45.829
Here we go.

16:45.904 --> 16:48.065
We are about ready
to take this

16:48.140 --> 16:50.233
and do exactly like they did
in the movie,

16:50.309 --> 16:52.607
going 50 miles an hour,
launching off the ramp,

16:52.678 --> 16:54.145
and "skipping" it across water.

16:54.213 --> 16:55.407
Here we go.

16:55.481 --> 16:57.915
In 3, 2, 1.

16:57.983 --> 16:59.644
Hit it.

16:59.718 --> 17:02.152
<i>Grant's actuators
put the pedal to the metal,</i>

17:02.221 --> 17:05.019
and the mustard menace
takes off.

17:05.089 --> 17:07.455
As the car gains speed,

17:07.526 --> 17:10.324
Grant expertly steers it
straight down a guideline.

17:10.396 --> 17:11.657
45...

17:11.730 --> 17:12.662
Until...

17:12.731 --> 17:15.529
50 miles an hour!

17:19.938 --> 17:22.098
With a hop, a flip, and a thump,

17:22.174 --> 17:25.575
the car crosses the pond,
but not quite as hoped.

17:25.644 --> 17:28.169
That car didn't skip...
it flipped!

17:30.783 --> 17:33.718
Oh, my gosh.

17:33.786 --> 17:34.810
That was insane.

17:34.887 --> 17:36.582
Look at what it did, though.

17:36.655 --> 17:39.681
It actually made it
to the other side of the pond.

17:39.758 --> 17:42.556
That's not
how it's supposed to do it!

17:42.628 --> 17:43.720
Wow.

17:43.796 --> 17:47.163
Oh, wow. Oh, my God,
we destroyed this car.

17:48.500 --> 17:50.866
Now, we matched pretty much
every aspect of the movie...

17:50.936 --> 17:54.599
the ramp, the speed,
the specifications of the car...

17:54.673 --> 17:57.005
and we got a completely
different result.

17:57.076 --> 17:59.874
What this means is that
the movie stunt was faked,

17:59.945 --> 18:02.277
that it wasn't
a real skip across a lake.

18:02.347 --> 18:03.905
Now, the most likely scenario

18:03.982 --> 18:06.177
is that there was
a submerged platform

18:06.251 --> 18:08.947
just a few inches below
the surface of the water

18:09.021 --> 18:11.546
that the car
actually bounced across.

18:11.623 --> 18:13.113
In addition, in the movie,

18:13.192 --> 18:15.524
the car lands
on its rear wheels first.

18:15.594 --> 18:18.427
The only way it could have
gotten that trajectory

18:18.497 --> 18:21.762
is if it were specifically
weighted for the stunt.

18:21.834 --> 18:25.463
Our car, on the other hand,
was weighted to match a stock,

18:25.537 --> 18:27.835
off-the-lot
1980s-era Lamborghini,

18:27.906 --> 18:29.703
and it plummeted nose-first.

18:29.775 --> 18:33.006
All this to say,
however you look at it,

18:33.078 --> 18:34.511
this myth is busted.

18:34.580 --> 18:36.514
<i>Busted indeed.</i>

18:36.582 --> 18:39.710
But surely they're not gonna
leave it there.

18:42.788 --> 18:47.555
Next, Adam and Jamie
go on a "grime" wave.

18:47.626 --> 18:50.220
"Relative Filth...
The Myth and the Plan,"

18:50.295 --> 18:51.557
take one.

18:55.968 --> 18:58.198
Dude, this one's yours.
You're leading this one in.

18:58.270 --> 18:59.828
...Can you remind me?
... Yeah.

18:59.905 --> 19:02.237
...Most people think their toilet seats are pretty dirty.
... Yeah.

19:02.307 --> 19:04.537
This myth states that that's not
necessarily the case,

19:04.610 --> 19:06.805
that there are many other
locations and things

19:06.879 --> 19:08.710
within your average person's
immediate vicinity

19:08.780 --> 19:12.181
that are far filthier
than your toilet seat.

19:12.251 --> 19:13.684
That's
what we're gonna test.

19:13.752 --> 19:15.549
We're gonna pick a bunch
of different places, go out,

19:15.621 --> 19:18.852
take samples, grow cultures,
compare the results,

19:18.924 --> 19:20.050
see what happens,
that kind of thing.

19:20.125 --> 19:21.649
Exactly.
Shall we start?

19:21.727 --> 19:22.625
...Yeah.
... Okay.

19:22.694 --> 19:24.855
<i>It seems every week
there's a new claim</i>

19:24.930 --> 19:27.194
about hidden household hazards.

19:27.266 --> 19:30.497
But are the microscopic critters
on everyday items

19:30.569 --> 19:33.060
more menacing
than the beastly bugs

19:33.138 --> 19:36.301
found on the old
porcelain throne?

19:36.375 --> 19:39.037
Well, the Mythbusters
are on the "swab. "

19:39.111 --> 19:41.545
But where to start?

19:41.613 --> 19:42.409
Now, you may be wondering,

19:42.481 --> 19:45.041
what are the criteria under
which we chose the samples

19:45.117 --> 19:46.084
that we are just about to test,

19:46.151 --> 19:47.584
and it's actually pretty
straightforward...

19:47.653 --> 19:51.180
we looked for objects
that you touch every single day

19:51.256 --> 19:52.814
that others might touch, too.

19:52.891 --> 19:56.292
<i>Great. But since germs
aren't visible to the naked eye,</i>

19:56.361 --> 19:58.989
we'll need a way
to track them down.

19:59.064 --> 20:01.464
Allow me to demonstrate our
sample collection methodology.

20:01.533 --> 20:04.001
It begins with a dry
cotton-tipped applicator,

20:04.069 --> 20:05.627
with which I swab
a one-inch square

20:05.704 --> 20:06.796
of the object in question.

20:06.872 --> 20:09.170
In this case, it's a scale model
of the lunar lander.

20:09.241 --> 20:12.642
Then, I dip that cotton swab
in tryptic soy broth

20:12.711 --> 20:13.700
for exactly 10 seconds.

20:13.779 --> 20:16.270
This is basically like a growth
medium, sterile growth medium.

20:16.348 --> 20:18.543
It's a liquid petri dish,
if you will.

20:18.617 --> 20:21.313
At the end of 10 seconds,
which is... now,

20:21.386 --> 20:24.480
I remove the cotton swab,
cap and label my soy broth.

20:24.556 --> 20:27.821
Later, I'll use it to try
and grow some bacteria.

20:27.893 --> 20:28.518
Yuck!

20:28.594 --> 20:31.256
If you'll excuse me, I've got
some samples to collect.

20:31.330 --> 20:35.528
First up, our yard stick...
the toilet seat.

20:40.772 --> 20:43.104
Mary had a little lamb.

20:43.175 --> 20:45.609
Its fleece was white as snow.

20:45.677 --> 20:46.541
3...

20:46.612 --> 20:49.604
9... 10 seconds.

20:49.681 --> 20:50.978
Money.

20:51.583 --> 20:53.744
Mary had a little lamb.
His fleece was white as snow.

20:53.819 --> 20:55.218
<i>They're not regressing.</i>

20:55.287 --> 20:57.255
The rhyme ensures
that each sample

20:57.322 --> 20:59.222
is swabbed for the same count.

20:59.291 --> 21:00.622
Shopping-cart handle.

21:01.960 --> 21:04.155
Mary had...
Kitchen sponge.

21:04.229 --> 21:06.993
<i>Everything they swab
has one thing in common...</i>

21:07.065 --> 21:08.327
...had a little lamb.

21:08.400 --> 21:10.561
Hotel room remote.

21:10.636 --> 21:12.365
<i>In a plethora of reports,</i>

21:12.437 --> 21:15.668
they've all been deemed dirtier
than a toilet seat.

21:15.741 --> 21:17.174
Keyboard.

21:17.843 --> 21:19.743
Light switch.

21:19.811 --> 21:22.575
<i>But can that really be true?</i>

21:22.648 --> 21:24.582
Cellphone.

21:25.851 --> 21:27.079
Hold on a second.

21:27.152 --> 21:29.052
With the everyday eight
collected,

21:29.121 --> 21:31.646
the guys call in
Dr. Russell Vance,

21:31.723 --> 21:34.385
an expert in microbiology.

21:34.459 --> 21:35.426
You guys ready?

21:35.494 --> 21:38.224
...Ready.
... Then let's begin.

21:38.297 --> 21:41.562
Okay.
Number one, toilet seat.

21:41.633 --> 21:44.101
<i>A precisely pipetted
amount of each broth</i>

21:44.169 --> 21:47.502
is carefully transferred
onto an agar petri dish.

21:50.142 --> 21:52.440
Into the incubator
they go.

21:52.511 --> 21:56.242
They'll sit there overnight
at 98.6 degrees.

21:56.315 --> 22:00.376
<i>And tomorrow, after a steamy
night of bacteria breeding,</i>

22:00.452 --> 22:03.148
there should be plenty
of germy growths.

22:03.221 --> 22:04.119
Let's go.

22:05.757 --> 22:07.622
The colonies that are growing
in there could be anything.

22:07.693 --> 22:10.321
They could be yeast, mold,
bacteria, whatever.

22:10.395 --> 22:12.363
So what we're gonna do
is we're gonna count and record

22:12.431 --> 22:14.399
the different types of colonies

22:14.466 --> 22:17.128
and also the overall
abundance of them.

22:17.202 --> 22:20.262
And based on that,
we'll pick the dirtiest ones.

22:20.339 --> 22:22.204
I see two.

22:22.274 --> 22:24.868
That's it?
Just two from the toilet seat?

22:24.943 --> 22:26.934
Just two.

22:27.012 --> 22:28.877
This is already
getting interesting.

22:28.947 --> 22:31.211
<i>The toilet seat
is remarkably clean.</i>

22:31.283 --> 22:33.547
But that's not so true
of the others...

22:33.618 --> 22:36.052
particularly the kitchen sponge.

22:36.121 --> 22:38.214
Oh-ho-ho!

22:38.290 --> 22:41.054
Dude!
That is nasty!

22:43.995 --> 22:46.395
Have fun counting that.
I'll see you next summer.

22:46.465 --> 22:48.831
Yeah.

22:48.900 --> 22:52.802
Well, we don't have that long,
so Dr. Vance has a solution.

22:52.871 --> 22:55.635
I think it's almost
uncountable.

22:55.707 --> 22:57.800
So, then how do you
write that down?

22:57.876 --> 23:00.276
Well, I would say
that's just off the charts.

23:02.080 --> 23:05.641
<i>The remaining six samples,
from cellphone to light switch,</i>

23:05.717 --> 23:07.116
are counted and logged.

23:07.185 --> 23:08.618
Well...

23:08.687 --> 23:12.646
That's it.
All present and ac-count-ed for.

23:12.724 --> 23:15.124
<i>Which means
it's time to sum up the results.</i>

23:15.193 --> 23:18.185
So, our everyday eight swabs
have become eight petri dishes,

23:18.263 --> 23:20.458
which in turn
have yielded eight results.

23:20.532 --> 23:21.726
And those results are,

23:21.800 --> 23:24.894
in order from least filthy
to most filthy...

23:24.970 --> 23:28.030
Can you editors help me out
with a graphic here?

23:28.106 --> 23:29.038
That's better.

23:29.107 --> 23:31.598
So, you can see, at number 8,
with only 2 colonies,

23:31.676 --> 23:33.041
is the toilet seat.

23:33.111 --> 23:35.136
And the colony-count increases
only slightly

23:35.213 --> 23:39.411
until we reach number 4,
the keyboard, with 65.

23:39.484 --> 23:41.918
From there on, things start
to get really dirty

23:41.987 --> 23:43.750
as the colonies
go through the roof,

23:43.822 --> 23:45.653
with the light switch
and the money

23:45.724 --> 23:47.658
before finally,
topping the chart,

23:47.726 --> 23:52.322
we have the kitchen sponge,
a sample so numerous

23:52.397 --> 23:54.490
we couldn't even count it.

23:54.566 --> 23:56.727
So, does this mean
that the kitchen sponge

23:56.802 --> 23:58.326
is the dirtiest thing
in your house?

23:58.403 --> 24:00.098
Well, it actually all depends

24:00.172 --> 24:01.366
on what your definition
of "dirty" is.

24:01.440 --> 24:02.930
I mean, sure,
there's a ton of colonies,

24:03.008 --> 24:05.841
but suppose those colonies
are all totally harmless,

24:05.911 --> 24:08.072
whereas the two colonies
we found on the toilet seat

24:08.146 --> 24:09.636
are really nasty?

24:09.714 --> 24:11.944
What we need to know now
is what we're looking at

24:12.017 --> 24:13.575
on those petri dishes.

24:13.652 --> 24:16.883
Luckily, we found a
microbiologist to help us out.

24:16.955 --> 24:18.889
<i>Yep, it's over to Dr. Vance...</i>

24:18.957 --> 24:20.322
...There you go.
... Fabulous.

24:20.392 --> 24:23.589
...to find out exactly what
kinds of ghastly germs

24:23.662 --> 24:25.653
lurk within our everyday eight.

24:32.437 --> 24:36.203
Can a car skip a pond
like a skimming stone?

24:36.274 --> 24:38.367
No, apparently not.

24:38.443 --> 24:42.937
But, of course, the Mythbusters
never leave any stone unturned.

24:43.014 --> 24:44.504
All right, so the scene
as portrayed in the movie

24:44.583 --> 24:45.572
is busted.

24:45.650 --> 24:47.083
A car going that fast,
hitting that ramp...

24:47.152 --> 24:48.915
there's no way
it would skip to freedom.

24:48.987 --> 24:50.386
But that's got me thinking...
I wonder what it would take

24:50.455 --> 24:51.854
for a sports car
like that to make it

24:51.923 --> 24:54.414
all the way across
the water surface by skipping?

24:54.493 --> 24:56.427
Well, that's why we have
our patented small scale here

24:56.495 --> 24:57.553
at "Mythbusters. "

24:57.629 --> 25:00.462
We'll take a 1/12 scale car,
a 1/12 scale pond,

25:00.532 --> 25:02.727
we'll fiddle around with
the parameters until it works,

25:02.801 --> 25:04.268
and then we'll take it
full scale.

25:04.336 --> 25:05.803
And those parameters
include

25:05.871 --> 25:07.532
presence or absence
of the ramp...

25:07.606 --> 25:09.267
What are we waiting for?
Let's go!

25:09.341 --> 25:11.332
...speed.
Don't forget the speed.

25:11.409 --> 25:14.742
<i>And to find out exactly what
it will take to skip a car,</i>

25:14.813 --> 25:17.111
first, they'll need
a scale vehicle.

25:17.182 --> 25:20.549
So what I have here
is a 1/12 scale Lamborghini.

25:20.619 --> 25:22.883
It's an exact replica
in every detail

25:22.954 --> 25:24.444
except for one... the weight.

25:24.523 --> 25:27.083
They did not
scale their weight correctly.

25:27.158 --> 25:31.458
All right, so, right now,
this weighs 4 pounds.

25:31.530 --> 25:33.430
I need to get it to 2 pounds.

25:33.498 --> 25:34.522
This is a pretty nice car.

25:34.599 --> 25:35.793
It kind of pains me to do this.

25:38.737 --> 25:40.432
Look at the detail
on this thing.

25:40.505 --> 25:42.769
<i>It's a little
auto shop of horrors</i>

25:42.841 --> 25:46.641
as Tory strips his teeny turbo
down to 2 pounds.

25:52.217 --> 25:53.081
You're probably thinking
to yourselves,

25:53.151 --> 25:55.176
"Uh, it's not
aerodynamic anymore. "

25:55.253 --> 25:58.814
Well, this is how I'm gonna
take care of that problem.

25:58.890 --> 26:01.654
I'm gonna use some tape
to cover up all the holes.

26:01.726 --> 26:06.754
And that way, it'll remain
aerodynamic and light.

26:06.831 --> 26:08.924
<i>So with a streamlined supercar,</i>

26:09.000 --> 26:11.332
how's the small scale
gonna go down?

26:11.403 --> 26:13.030
So, I had this car jacked up.

26:13.104 --> 26:14.537
All you need to do
is hit the gas

26:14.606 --> 26:16.574
and then stick this car
underneath the wheel,

26:16.641 --> 26:19.041
which will fire it out just like a baseball
pitching machine.

26:19.110 --> 26:20.475
It'll go down the track,
into the trough,

26:20.545 --> 26:22.376
and skip across the water.

26:22.447 --> 26:23.436
At least, that's the plan.

26:23.515 --> 26:25.779
I haven't really
tested this yet.

26:25.850 --> 26:29.115
<i>As a final touch,
Tory adds a bike speedometer</i>

26:29.187 --> 26:32.748
to track the speed of the car
when it's pushed into the wheel.

26:32.824 --> 26:35.315
First things first, we're gonna
set it up just like in the movie

26:35.393 --> 26:37.258
with a slight ramp
and a scale car

26:37.329 --> 26:39.320
going at a scale
50 miles an hour.

26:39.397 --> 26:42.230
Here we go.
In 3, 2, 1!

26:45.203 --> 26:48.661
Wow.
That was exciting.

26:48.740 --> 26:51.607
<i>Maybe not, but off
the ramp at 50 miles per hour,</i>

26:51.676 --> 26:57.205
the car noses into the water,
just like the full-scale.

26:57.282 --> 26:59.750
All right, so my theory is that
we need to ditch the ramp

26:59.818 --> 27:01.979
and have the car come into
the water at a lower angle.

27:02.053 --> 27:04.886
So for this next test,
we're gonna do it at myth speed.

27:04.956 --> 27:07.823
50 miles an hour... or a scale
speed of 14 miles an hour.

27:07.892 --> 27:09.086
And we won't have the ramp.

27:09.160 --> 27:11.287
So we'll see if it works
any better.

27:11.363 --> 27:13.422
3, 2, 1.

27:13.498 --> 27:14.396
Whoo.

27:14.466 --> 27:15.490
That was cool.

27:15.567 --> 27:16.829
<i>Indeed it was.</i>

27:16.901 --> 27:20.496
That was a small-scale car skip.

27:20.572 --> 27:22.369
Now, without the ramp,
going at 50 miles an hour,

27:22.440 --> 27:23.464
the car skipped.

27:23.541 --> 27:25.532
Eventually, it sank,
but it did skip.

27:25.610 --> 27:27.976
So it's obvious that the ramp
is a hindrance.

27:28.046 --> 27:30.879
The shallower the angle
of attack, the better it is.

27:30.949 --> 27:32.746
And I think if we get the car
going fast enough,

27:32.817 --> 27:34.011
we're gonna get
that little Lamborghini

27:34.085 --> 27:36.178
to skip the whole way.

27:36.254 --> 27:38.347
Well, for kicks and giggles,
should we try and go faster?

27:38.423 --> 27:40.288
...Like 100 miles an hour?
... Yeah.

27:40.358 --> 27:43.623
Yeah!

27:43.695 --> 27:47.028
Hit it.

27:47.098 --> 27:48.861
20.

27:48.933 --> 27:50.628
28.

27:50.702 --> 27:53.102
Oh-ho-ho!
Holy crap!

27:53.171 --> 27:54.069
<i>Tory's right.</i>

27:54.139 --> 27:59.202
At 100 miles per hour, the model
car skips and would skip again,

27:59.277 --> 28:03.179
except it runs out of trough.

28:03.248 --> 28:04.306
Check out this high-speed.

28:04.382 --> 28:05.349
At 28 miles an hour,

28:05.417 --> 28:07.408
which is 100 miles an hour
for a real car,

28:07.485 --> 28:10.113
the car is skipping
across the water,

28:10.188 --> 28:12.281
which means speed is gonna be
a huge factor

28:12.357 --> 28:14.154
when we go to do this
full scale.

28:14.225 --> 28:15.385
But this is just small scale.

28:15.460 --> 28:17.325
This is a toy
we're using right now.

28:17.395 --> 28:20.990
When we go to full scale, using
a car weighing 2,600 pounds,

28:21.066 --> 28:22.693
who knows what's gonna happen.

28:24.302 --> 28:26.293
<i>Dirt.
It's everywhere.</i>

28:26.371 --> 28:29.067
You can't run,
and you can't hide.

28:29.140 --> 28:31.700
But is there more frightening
filth lurking

28:31.776 --> 28:34.836
on everyday items
than on your toilet seat?

28:34.913 --> 28:38.679
Adam and Jamie are finding out,
and the results are in.

28:38.750 --> 28:39.739
For those of you
playing at home,

28:39.818 --> 28:42.616
it is finally time to count down
the everyday eight.

28:42.687 --> 28:45.656
Now, this is the table
based solely on colony count.

28:45.724 --> 28:48.022
And as you can see,
kitchen sponge, off the charts,

28:48.093 --> 28:49.924
is the filthiest thing we found.

28:49.994 --> 28:52.326
Toilet seat... the cleanest.

28:52.397 --> 28:53.921
But check out
what happens to this list

28:53.998 --> 28:56.660
when we account not only for the
number of bacterial colonies,

28:56.735 --> 28:58.828
but also for how nasty
they might be.

28:58.903 --> 29:01.463
Toilet seat moves up
a couple of notches,

29:01.539 --> 29:03.598
specifically because
while it only had two colonies,

29:03.675 --> 29:06.075
those colonies were actually
pretty nasty.

29:06.144 --> 29:08.635
The other big movers,
hotel remote control moved down

29:08.713 --> 29:10.078
because it had some colonies,

29:10.148 --> 29:11.740
but they weren't actually
bacteria.

29:11.816 --> 29:13.408
And the cellphone moved up

29:13.485 --> 29:15.214
because what was on it
was pretty nasty.

29:15.286 --> 29:17.652
But, staying strong at number 1,

29:17.722 --> 29:21.089
kitchen sponge,
which had acine...

29:21.159 --> 29:22.854
This stuff,
which is apparently pretty bad

29:22.927 --> 29:24.690
if you have
a weakened immune system.

29:24.763 --> 29:26.458
James Franklin Hyneman,
what do you think?

29:28.199 --> 29:30.724
Nice work. But I don't think
we can call it yet.

29:30.802 --> 29:33.100
I mean, it's only
a single, solitary swab.

29:33.171 --> 29:34.832
We need
a larger sample size.

29:34.906 --> 29:35.895
All right.

29:35.974 --> 29:37.339
Well, what say we choose
the top five...

29:37.408 --> 29:39.876
toilet seat as a control,
plus the four top contenders,

29:39.944 --> 29:42.174
and do a really nice
large sample size with those.

29:42.247 --> 29:44.044
...Our filthy five.
... Works for me.

29:44.115 --> 29:46.481
<i>So, to expand their sample size,</i>

29:46.551 --> 29:50.385
they're off to U.C. Berkeley,
where a class of microbiologists

29:50.455 --> 29:52.821
are about
to start Mythbusting 101.

29:52.891 --> 29:53.880
Hello.

29:53.958 --> 29:55.289
Hello.

29:55.360 --> 29:56.418
We need your help.

29:56.494 --> 29:58.359
We've selected
several surfaces

29:58.429 --> 30:00.522
that we're calling
the filthy five.

30:00.598 --> 30:02.964
Now, these are surfaces that
people come into contact with

30:03.034 --> 30:04.262
on a daily basis,

30:04.335 --> 30:07.395
and the question we need to
answer is, how dirty are they?

30:07.472 --> 30:08.905
That's where you come in.

30:08.973 --> 30:11.373
Now, in order to get
a nice, big, fat sample size,

30:11.442 --> 30:15.173
we need 50 of you to collect us
samples from the following...

30:15.246 --> 30:17.874
Toilet seat,
a light switch,

30:17.949 --> 30:20.315
a kitchen sponge,
money,

30:20.385 --> 30:22.444
and a computer keyboard.

30:22.520 --> 30:23.782
Can you guys help us?

30:23.855 --> 30:25.413
Yes!

30:25.490 --> 30:26.855
Awesome.

30:26.925 --> 30:29.155
And with a hunger
for the filthy five facts,

30:29.227 --> 30:34.790
our mob of microbiologists
quickly get the swab done.

30:34.866 --> 30:37.494
Mary had a little lamb.
Its fleece was white as snow.

30:38.837 --> 30:41.670
<i>Then, once again,
the samples are transferred</i>

30:41.739 --> 30:44.401
to the petri agar,
incubated, counted,

30:44.475 --> 30:46.306
and finally DNA tested.

30:53.218 --> 30:54.480
Want more?

30:54.552 --> 30:57.146
Log on to
discovery. com/mythbusters.

30:57.222 --> 30:58.211
Go!

31:02.160 --> 31:05.186
<i>So far,
in the "Cannonball Run" caper,</i>

31:05.263 --> 31:08.721
we've seen a spectacular flip,
but there's been no skip.

31:08.800 --> 31:13.396
But after small-scale success,
this myth is far from "sunk. "

31:13.471 --> 31:15.996
In the small-scale tests,

31:16.074 --> 31:18.065
we did learn a couple
of important things.

31:18.142 --> 31:21.168
Yeah, first thing is that
the ramp has got to go.

31:21.246 --> 31:22.838
We need to glide
onto the water surface

31:22.914 --> 31:24.313
as seamlessly as possible.

31:24.382 --> 31:26.282
So the ramp is out.

31:26.351 --> 31:28.444
And also, speed is a very
important factor here.

31:28.519 --> 31:29.986
The faster the car is going,

31:30.054 --> 31:32.852
the better chances it has
of getting across the pond.

31:32.924 --> 31:34.619
Now, how fast
are we talking?

31:34.692 --> 31:36.683
...Are we talking rocket fast?
... No.

31:36.761 --> 31:39.321
It's actually surprising
how little speed we need.

31:39.397 --> 31:41.957
All we would have to do
is get another sports car,

31:42.033 --> 31:43.022
take it to the max,

31:43.101 --> 31:44.898
and it should make it
across the water.

31:44.969 --> 31:47.028
But just in case, why don't
I add some nitrous

31:47.105 --> 31:48.595
just for
the extra little kick?

31:48.673 --> 31:49.662
Perfect.

31:49.741 --> 31:51.572
Wait. Yes.

31:51.643 --> 31:54.168
I think I see some
radio controlling in my future.

31:54.245 --> 31:55.940
It's like
you're a mind reader.

31:56.014 --> 31:57.606
<i>Yep,
Grant's the controlling type,</i>

31:57.682 --> 32:02.483
and luckily, the team has found
just the thing for test two.

32:02.553 --> 32:06.080
So, we pretty much know what
went wrong with the first car.

32:06.157 --> 32:09.718
Believe it or not, we got a
second car of the same vintage,

32:09.794 --> 32:11.625
and this one is as good as gold.

32:11.696 --> 32:13.061
In fact, it is gold.

32:13.131 --> 32:16.396
But before we can take it back
to madras for a second try,

32:16.467 --> 32:18.958
we've got to do a little
radio-control magic.

32:21.272 --> 32:22.864
Now, after its trip
across the water,

32:22.941 --> 32:25.409
I managed to salvage
the control system...

32:25.476 --> 32:26.807
And here it is.

32:26.878 --> 32:29.574
Now all I have to do is
install this in the second car,

32:29.647 --> 32:31.239
and we'll be ready to go.

32:31.316 --> 32:34.649
Since I've already done this
once, it should be pretty easy.

32:34.719 --> 32:36.914
<i>Once again,
it's a simple setup</i>

32:36.988 --> 32:39.320
of servo, cylinders, and wiring.

32:40.325 --> 32:41.417
Which one is it?

32:41.492 --> 32:43.960
The brown wire,
the other brown wire,

32:44.028 --> 32:46.121
or the other other brown wire?

32:46.197 --> 32:48.893
<i>And while Grant's
installing his system,</i>

32:48.967 --> 32:52.061
Jessi is giving
the horsepower a boost.

32:52.136 --> 32:54.730
Okay. So what we have here
is a normal engine.

32:54.806 --> 32:56.467
Air comes in, mixes with fuel,

32:56.541 --> 32:59.203
and then is dispersed down
into the cylinders.

32:59.277 --> 33:00.642
Now, we need this little engine

33:00.712 --> 33:02.771
to go as fast as we can
possibly make it go.

33:02.847 --> 33:04.838
So we're gonna be
adding nitrous.

33:04.916 --> 33:07.783
Now, what nitrous does
is it's added into the mixture,

33:07.852 --> 33:10.650
helping cool it down,
giving it a more dense charge.

33:10.722 --> 33:12.246
It adds more o xygen,

33:12.323 --> 33:14.723
all of this making the rate
of combustion happen

33:14.792 --> 33:17.158
a whole lot faster,
which, in turn,

33:17.228 --> 33:20.561
makes this little car go
as fast as we want it to go.

33:20.631 --> 33:23.065
You know what would make
this car more awesome?

33:23.134 --> 33:24.499
Flames.

33:24.569 --> 33:28.505
'Cause everybody knows that cars
with flames are more awesome.

33:31.909 --> 33:33.877
See? I told you.

33:33.945 --> 33:36.413
<i>While flames
undoubtedly add style,</i>

33:36.481 --> 33:39.917
Jessi's NOS system
will add much-needed speed.

33:39.984 --> 33:42.214
All right, being the fact
that this is an older car,

33:42.286 --> 33:44.151
it's not gonna want
to get up to the speeds

33:44.222 --> 33:45.450
that we really want it to.

33:45.523 --> 33:47.548
So adding this nitrous
is definitely gonna help us

33:47.625 --> 33:48.751
get across that water.

33:48.826 --> 33:51.021
Especially by looking
at all of our past tests,

33:51.095 --> 33:53.393
we need as much speed
as we can get.

33:53.464 --> 33:56.627
So this is just gonna be
one of those added benefits.

33:56.701 --> 33:58.328
So basically, all I got to do
is hook up the nitrous,

33:58.403 --> 34:00.496
tap into the fuel line
to wire it,

34:00.571 --> 34:01.663
and it's ready to go.

34:01.739 --> 34:02.899
It's very, very simple.

34:02.974 --> 34:04.771
Okay, so the car
is looking great.

34:04.842 --> 34:06.207
The radio system's in.

34:06.277 --> 34:09.110
Jessi's added the sheet metal on
the bottom to reduce the drag,

34:09.179 --> 34:11.148
and the NOS system
to increase the speed,

34:11.215 --> 34:13.206
and Tory has finished
the nose cone.

34:13.284 --> 34:15.650
Now all we have to do
is go back to Oregon

34:15.719 --> 34:18.621
and see once and for all
if we can get a car to skip.

34:18.688 --> 34:20.179
What could possibly go wrong?

34:21.092 --> 34:24.960
This ain't built for comfort,
that's for sure.

34:25.029 --> 34:27.690
But, man,
it sure looks good.

34:27.764 --> 34:29.755
They've souped up
their supercar

34:29.833 --> 34:32.199
to give it the best chance
of a skip.

34:32.270 --> 34:36.366
But there's still one more
modification to make.

34:36.440 --> 34:39.137
The first thing I have to do
is get rid of this ramp.

34:39.210 --> 34:40.574
I'm gonna get my big digger

34:40.645 --> 34:42.476
and knock this thing
out of here.

34:42.547 --> 34:44.174
<i>Counterintuitively,</i>

34:44.248 --> 34:47.877
ramping up this test
means getting rid of the ramp.

34:47.952 --> 34:50.216
Who said TV's not glamorous?

34:50.288 --> 34:51.550
Pfft!

34:52.623 --> 34:54.215
This little wire right here?

34:54.292 --> 34:56.123
This is the "go, baby, go" wire.

34:56.194 --> 34:59.755
Now, my only concern
is that this system

34:59.831 --> 35:03.597
gives out over a 100 horsepower
boost to the engine.

35:03.668 --> 35:07.604
That's basically doubling
this little guy's horsepower.

35:07.672 --> 35:09.799
So my concerns lie in the fact

35:09.874 --> 35:12.968
of possibly blowing up before
it actually hits the water.

35:13.044 --> 35:14.102
But I have faith

35:14.178 --> 35:16.544
that it's actually gonna make it
all the way.

35:16.614 --> 35:18.081
Mostly.

35:18.149 --> 35:19.548
<i>Thanks to the nitrous,</i>

35:19.617 --> 35:22.882
it'll be traveling at twice
the speed of the last test.

35:22.954 --> 35:25.422
And if the car
is traveling fast enough,

35:25.490 --> 35:28.857
each time it hits the surface,
forcing water downward,

35:28.926 --> 35:32.259
the opposing force of the water
pushing up on the car

35:32.330 --> 35:33.888
should propel it forward.

35:33.965 --> 35:36.058
At least, that's the theory.

35:36.134 --> 35:38.500
Nitrous bottle
is now open.

35:38.569 --> 35:39.866
System engaged.

35:39.937 --> 35:44.237
Nothing's gonna happen
until you push your "go" button.

35:44.308 --> 35:46.276
...All right.
... All right.

35:46.344 --> 35:47.971
No turning back now.

35:48.045 --> 35:50.673
<i>Grant nervously makes
his last-minute checks,</i>

35:50.748 --> 35:52.807
and then it's go time.

35:52.884 --> 35:54.977
All right,
time to turn on the car.

36:01.392 --> 36:02.984
The vehicle
is in drive.

36:03.060 --> 36:04.550
Yay!

36:04.629 --> 36:06.096
Okay.

36:06.164 --> 36:06.653
Ahh.

36:06.731 --> 36:08.926
Dude,
has it hit you yet?

36:09.000 --> 36:11.468
We are about to skip a car
across a pond!

36:11.536 --> 36:12.662
This is crazy, man!

36:12.737 --> 36:14.671
This is totally,
totally crazy.

36:14.739 --> 36:16.604
We're like
Thelma and Louise!

36:16.674 --> 36:18.073
We are?

36:18.142 --> 36:19.905
I just say dumb things
when I'm excited.

36:19.977 --> 36:21.103
Okay.

36:23.781 --> 36:26.215
In 3, 2, 1.

36:26.284 --> 36:27.216
Hit it.

36:27.285 --> 36:29.048
Okay, brakes off.

36:29.120 --> 36:32.385
And... here we go.

36:32.456 --> 36:34.686
<i>It's make or break time.</i>

36:34.759 --> 36:36.351
Grant builds up the speed,

36:36.427 --> 36:39.396
then presses
the "go, baby, go" button.

36:39.463 --> 36:40.555
Here goes the nitrous.

36:40.631 --> 36:42.394
The car surges forward,

36:42.466 --> 36:44.491
and then when it reaches
the edge of the lake,

36:44.569 --> 36:46.696
physics take over.

36:53.010 --> 36:54.568
...Yeah!
... Yeah!

36:55.646 --> 36:57.580
We skipped a car
across a lake!

36:57.648 --> 36:59.047
Yeah!

36:59.116 --> 37:01.243
The Mythbusters
understandably

37:01.319 --> 37:04.288
can't contain their excitement.

37:04.355 --> 37:06.983
That was a full-scale
car skip.

37:07.058 --> 37:10.755
The high speed shows
the supercar skipped twice

37:10.828 --> 37:12.693
across the 100-foot lake

37:12.763 --> 37:15.527
and then continued to drive
on the far bank.

37:15.600 --> 37:20.765
That is, until Grant remembers
to apply the brakes.

37:20.838 --> 37:22.066
Yes!

37:22.139 --> 37:24.334
It's crazy.

37:24.408 --> 37:25.739
I was piloting in the car.

37:25.810 --> 37:27.801
We hit the water.
I saw a big splash.

37:27.878 --> 37:29.505
Like, okay, we hit the water.

37:29.580 --> 37:31.172
And then the water went down,

37:31.249 --> 37:33.809
and the car was still driving
on the other side!

37:33.884 --> 37:35.977
We did it! We skipped!

37:38.189 --> 37:40.089
And this little guy!
I'm so proud of it!

37:40.157 --> 37:42.387
I am so proud of it...
we doubled its horsepower.

37:42.460 --> 37:44.052
More than doubled
its horsepower.

37:44.128 --> 37:45.891
And it's still running.

37:45.963 --> 37:47.555
Look!

37:47.632 --> 37:49.327
I'm so happy.

37:49.400 --> 37:50.560
We did it!

37:50.635 --> 37:53.229
We set out to skip a car,
and we actually did it!

37:53.304 --> 37:55.795
I mean, the small scale
said it would work,

37:55.873 --> 37:57.272
but we didn't believe it.

37:57.341 --> 37:58.968
But we brought it out here,
and it did it!

37:59.043 --> 38:00.601
It did exactly
what the small scale did!

38:00.678 --> 38:02.839
Seeing is believing.

38:02.913 --> 38:04.642
I can't get over this.

38:04.715 --> 38:07.912
We actually skipped a car
across a pond.

38:07.985 --> 38:10.579
It's so awesome
that they're both still running.

38:10.655 --> 38:12.179
I can't believe
it worked!

38:12.256 --> 38:14.486
I know.
We got our car to flip and skip.

38:14.558 --> 38:16.389
All right,
last one to the shop!

38:19.463 --> 38:21.055
I know a shortcut!

38:21.132 --> 38:23.566
Go, go, go, go, go!

38:23.634 --> 38:26.398
Whoo-hoo!

38:28.506 --> 38:30.440
Eat our dust!

38:30.508 --> 38:32.772
You guys,
that was pretty awesome.

38:32.843 --> 38:34.834
I have never seen anything
like that before.

38:34.912 --> 38:37.403
I mean, we totally
replicated the result

38:37.481 --> 38:39.949
and we got a car
that weighs over a ton

38:40.017 --> 38:42.315
to bounce across the surface
of a pond.

38:42.386 --> 38:44.854
I know. And how cool
was that high speed?

38:44.922 --> 38:45.854
Absolutely.

38:45.923 --> 38:47.914
But you know,
the most amazing thing

38:47.992 --> 38:50.256
is how little
it actually took to do it.

38:50.328 --> 38:52.296
I mean, that was
a 15-year-old car

38:52.363 --> 38:54.388
going a little bit more
than highway speed.

38:54.465 --> 38:56.592
No rockets,
no special tires,

38:56.667 --> 38:59.227
no ramp,
and no underwater platform.

38:59.303 --> 39:00.429
And it skipped
across the lake.

39:00.504 --> 39:01.869
Just like the small scale
said it would.

39:01.939 --> 39:04.271
I agree. However,
I'm with Grant...

39:04.342 --> 39:07.140
I just cannot believe
how easy it was to do.

39:07.211 --> 39:08.178
In fact, it's so easy,

39:08.245 --> 39:09.872
I think
we really need to stop and say

39:09.947 --> 39:11.710
do not try this at home.

39:11.782 --> 39:12.942
Yes.

39:13.017 --> 39:16.077
But let's keep in mind,
the movie is still busted.

39:16.153 --> 39:17.120
Of course!

39:17.188 --> 39:18.212
Going 50 miles an hour
with a ramp,

39:18.289 --> 39:19.415
and you're going for a swim.

39:19.490 --> 39:21.014
Yeah, but you get rid
of that ramp,

39:21.092 --> 39:22.491
you put the pedal
to the metal,

39:22.560 --> 39:24.687
and you just might
make it home safe and dry.

39:24.762 --> 39:26.525
Yep.
You know what I think?

39:26.597 --> 39:30.089
I think we need to look at that
high speed shot one more time.

39:31.535 --> 39:32.866
<i>Absolutely.</i>

39:32.937 --> 39:34.768
'Cause with results like these,

39:34.839 --> 39:37.069
we're, uh,
skipping over ourselves

39:37.141 --> 39:38.574
to show you them again.

39:54.425 --> 39:56.791
But spectacular
high-speeds aside,

39:56.861 --> 40:00.092
let's not forget
that there's another dirty story

40:00.164 --> 40:02.029
awaiting conclusion.

40:02.099 --> 40:04.499
And after a swath of swabs,

40:04.568 --> 40:06.559
and a deluge of DNA tests,

40:06.637 --> 40:09.606
that conclusion
is at last cooked.

40:11.075 --> 40:11.404
Ladies and gentlemen,

40:11.475 --> 40:14.239
it is finally time
for the filthy five countdown.

40:14.311 --> 40:16.404
In order
from cleanest to dirtiest,

40:16.480 --> 40:19.677
and starting at number five,
we have the light switch.

40:19.750 --> 40:22.310
Number four, our control,
the toilet seat.

40:22.386 --> 40:24.081
Number three... the keyboard.

40:24.155 --> 40:26.419
Number two... money.

40:26.490 --> 40:28.151
And the number-one
dirtiest thing

40:28.225 --> 40:29.590
of everything that we tested,

40:29.660 --> 40:31.992
he's back on top after a year
of hard training...

40:32.062 --> 40:33.962
Jamie, come on in
and name number one.

40:35.199 --> 40:36.757
The kitchen sponge.

40:36.834 --> 40:38.233
Where does that leave us?

40:38.302 --> 40:40.896
Well, given the myth
that there are everyday things

40:40.971 --> 40:43.872
in your house that are far
filthier than your toilet seat,

40:43.941 --> 40:45.636
I'd say
it's totally confirmed.

40:45.709 --> 40:47.836
Confirmed it is.
