Good afternoon, everyone,

01:18.286 --> 01:23.208
and welcome to the 2016
City of Flint Tree Lighting Ceremony.

01:23.291 --> 01:25.084

01:25.168 --> 01:27.295
[compere] Come on, Flint,
let's make some noise!

01:27.796 --> 01:30.215
I know it's cold,
but we're gonna get through it.

01:30.298 --> 01:33.593
We're gonna have a wonderful welcome
by our illustrious mayor,

01:33.676 --> 01:35.470
Mayor Karen Weaver.

01:35.553 --> 01:38.181
Look... Good evening, everybody.

01:38.264 --> 01:40.850
I wish I could sing
like you were doing, but I can't,

01:40.934 --> 01:42.477
so I'm gonna have to talk.

01:43.269 --> 01:45.313
Now, I want to say that we recognize

01:45.396 --> 01:49.442
that this has been a challenging year
for the city of Flint and its citizens,

01:49.859 --> 01:51.277
but this is a great time,

01:51.361 --> 01:53.988
it's an ideal time to come together,

01:54.072 --> 01:56.658
be thankful for the progress
that has been made

01:56.741 --> 01:59.202
and celebrate the holiday season.

01:59.285 --> 02:00.703
So that's what we'll do.

02:00.787 --> 02:03.373
[applause]

02:03.456 --> 02:06.668
At this moment, we're gonna have
Police Chief Tim Johnson.

02:06.751 --> 02:08.752
Let's give him a hand as he comes.

02:08.836 --> 02:11.172

02:12.257 --> 02:14.008
[Tim] Good afternoon, everyone.

02:14.092 --> 02:17.345
I just want to take this time
to thank you for your support

02:17.428 --> 02:19.639
on this public safety millage.

02:19.722 --> 02:24.018
It meant the world to the Police and Fire
Department as a whole for public safety,

02:24.102 --> 02:26.855
and you guys showed us a lot of love,

02:26.938 --> 02:30.733
and we're gonna do our best to continue
to give you the service that you deserve.

02:30.817 --> 02:34.112
I just want to thank you for your support.
We love you. We appreciate you.

02:34.487 --> 02:35.738

[compere] And for... what we're here for,
the tree lighting ceremony,

02:42.996 --> 02:45.165
I need everybody to count with me.

02:45.248 --> 02:48.543

the brighter the lights are going to be.

There's always something going on.

I want four: two boys and two girls,

I'll be fine.

04:55.670 --> 04:56.879
Yeah, that's a lot of kids.

05:37.420 --> 05:40.173
I got promoted to the Detective Bureau,

05:40.256 --> 05:43.509
and I needed something to show me

05:43.593 --> 05:47.221
that I was, you know,
worthy of working here

05:47.305 --> 05:49.599
and that my hard work was being noticed.

<i>I was so happy about the millage.</i>

05:52.894 --> 05:54.103

<i>the major thing on my mind.</i>

05:58.149 --> 06:01.819
<i>If I get laid off, I don't know</i>
<i>if I can go on that vacation.</i>

06:01.903 --> 06:06.032
That's a lot of money to spend
if you're gonna lose your job.

We're actually off the resort here,
headed to a nice little lagoon.

06:27.804 --> 06:30.848
And she is impatiently waving me along.

06:33.643 --> 06:36.104
[Bridgette] What did you think
of your first plane ride?

06:36.187 --> 06:37.647
Awesome!

-[Bridgette] Scared of the turbulence?
-No.

06:40.066 --> 06:43.027
[Bridgette] What about the man in Customs
that yelled at you?

06:43.111 --> 06:44.612
Yeah, I was a little scared.

06:45.113 --> 06:46.823
[Bridgette] Why did you get yelled at?

06:47.406 --> 06:48.991
Because Bridgette left me.

06:50.159 --> 06:52.662
-[Bridgette] I didn't know.
-Yeah, well, you did.

Years and years,
if ever in his adult life,

he said that that's the first time
he's relaxed, which is crazy.

I mean, he's 36.

He's gone, like 15 or 16 years
and he has never relaxed.

07:15.226 --> 07:18.688

I took a bunch of pictures.

07:18.980 --> 07:22.024
You know, it was beautiful. Beautiful.

07:22.567 --> 07:25.486
Then up there above the clouds,
it's totally different, you know?

07:25.987 --> 07:30.533
You can actually see so much, for so far.

07:31.117 --> 07:32.785
I can still smell it.

07:32.869 --> 07:34.829

to the time I got back,

07:56.893 --> 07:59.562
I was not a police officer

This is a serious announcement
we'll be making today.

09:02.792 --> 09:06.754
In Flint, we're seeking justice
for the citizens who were poisoned.

09:06.837 --> 09:09.715
We have filed 51 criminal charges against 15 current
or former state officials.

09:13.010 --> 09:14.887
-Is that the Attorney General?
-Yeah.

09:15.555 --> 09:19.517
The Director of the Michigan
Department of Health has been charged

09:19.600 --> 09:23.563
with involuntary manslaughter
and misconduct in office.

09:23.646 --> 09:27.108
One felony and one misdemeanor
of involuntary manslaughter.

Three felonies and two misdemeanors...
Three felonies and one misdemeanor...

09:31.237 --> 09:33.990
An additional felony
of involuntary manslaughter,

09:34.073 --> 09:38.077
obstruction of justice
and lying to a police officer.

09:38.578 --> 09:42.915
<i>So, I think what families in Flint thought</i>
<i>is, "Does the system work?"</i>

09:43.291 --> 09:46.294
We're here today to demonstrate
the system is working.

09:46.377 --> 09:49.463
We're holding those accountable.
I think that's what they want.

09:49.547 --> 09:54.343
[reporter] <i>All of these charges hinge</i>
<i>on conspiracy to hide the lead problem,</i>

09:54.427 --> 09:57.263
<i>from changing lead tests</i>
<i>to make the levels appear lower,</i>

09:57.346 --> 09:59.390
<i>to concealing those results.</i>

10:01.309 --> 10:06.105
I've heard from some who believe I've been
too harsh on the Snyder administration.

10:06.647 --> 10:07.773
Well, so be it.

10:09.400 --> 10:11.360
Involuntary manslaughter charges hold

10:11.444 --> 10:13.654
a penalty of up to 15 years in prison

10:13.738 --> 10:16.532
and/or a fine
if those people are convicted.

-[Tim] Alright.

10:46.228 --> 10:48.981
[Tim] There's been a lot going on
with this millage.

10:49.065 --> 10:51.984
Now we've got to move forward
and start hiring some new officers.

10:52.068 --> 10:55.404
We have eight full-time positions
and eight part-time positions

10:55.488 --> 10:57.490
that we're gonna try to fill immediately.

10:57.573 --> 10:59.367
It's time for a change.

10:59.450 --> 11:04.121
We just finished our audit,
which means I go from audit to budget.

11:04.413 --> 11:06.040
So we're starting our new budget.

11:06.666 --> 11:09.502
Chief, I may need your help
to get him to push that through

11:09.585 --> 11:13.422
so we can see what is needed
in the next year and the following year.

11:13.506 --> 11:17.093
It's bad enough that we're short
on manpower and some other things.

11:17.176 --> 11:21.680
I don't want you guys short on equipment
or whatever else your needs are.

11:21.764 --> 11:25.226
We won't know unless you tell us.
Some things just have to be gotten.

11:25.309 --> 11:29.730
Well, if... if we can throw out
the cruisers in patrol,

11:29.814 --> 11:32.650
it is now at a critical point.

11:32.983 --> 11:36.904
I put three individuals out

11:36.987 --> 11:38.906
on foot beats the other day,

11:38.989 --> 11:42.284
because we just do not have cars.

11:42.368 --> 11:44.954
If I've got to go out there
and beg and borrow

11:45.037 --> 11:47.832
for some more dollars from somewhere
to make it happen,

11:47.915 --> 11:50.668
or turn Rick upside down
and shake his pockets out...

11:51.460 --> 11:54.672
Me and Rick,
we joke about this all time, so...

11:56.006 --> 12:00.261
But seriously, truly, truly, I appreciate
the job you guys have been doing.

12:00.344 --> 12:04.432
It would not be possible if you guys
weren't doing what you're doing out there.

12:05.224 --> 12:07.017
Thanks, guys. Appreciate you.

12:09.645 --> 12:11.355
[officer] And God bless the millage.

12:11.439 --> 12:14.859
[Tim] Yeah, tell me about it!
I've already said that a million times.

12:19.864 --> 12:21.574
[Lewis] My belt is tight, though.

12:22.283 --> 12:23.909
Just push it in. That's right.

12:24.410 --> 12:27.163
Then I've got to bring it...
See how it's in there?

12:27.413 --> 12:30.249
That buckles in.
You've got to come right to it.

Still got my dancing skills.

go clean my brother-in-law,
make him clean his room up,

13:17.796 --> 13:20.132

their medicine,

13:29.099 --> 13:30.893
And that's the key. Stay busy.

13:31.310 --> 13:34.772
Because like they say,
if you don't use it, you lose it.

13:34.855 --> 13:37.858

the mayor of the city of Flint,

14:05.719 --> 14:07.263
Dr. Karen Weaver.

14:11.058 --> 14:13.018
[Karen] Good evening, everybody.

14:13.102 --> 14:16.313
It is just so nice
to see so many of you here.

14:17.481 --> 14:21.819
We keep talking about all of the positive
things going on in the city of Flint,

14:21.902 --> 14:24.697
And here's another testament to that fact.

14:24.780 --> 14:27.658
This is community policing at its best.

14:28.117 --> 14:30.953
And this has been Chief Johnson's...

14:31.412 --> 14:32.955
his pet project,

14:33.038 --> 14:36.834
and so I really have to tip my hat
to him and his team

14:36.917 --> 14:38.294
for making this happen.

14:38.377 --> 14:41.755
I cannot take credit for this at all.
This is all due to you.

14:42.631 --> 14:44.842
And with that,
I'm gonna have Chief Johnson

14:44.925 --> 14:47.386
come on up here and address everybody.

14:47.469 --> 14:48.554
[Tim] Good evening.

14:48.888 --> 14:51.015
I can't tell you
what this does to my heart

14:51.098 --> 14:52.933
to see you guys in this uniform.

14:53.017 --> 14:55.269
I know the training wasn't easy,

14:55.686 --> 14:58.564
so I appreciate
you guys sticking through it,

14:59.189 --> 15:00.858
and we welcome you aboard,

15:01.317 --> 15:04.361
and thank you for joining
the Flint Police Department ranks.

15:08.240 --> 15:12.077
Clearly, this is the moment that
you've been waiting for for 154 hours.

15:12.161 --> 15:13.579
[laughter]

15:14.705 --> 15:17.249
[Devon] Reserve Officer Lewis Pasteur.

15:23.172 --> 15:25.049
Reserve Officer Lewis Spears.

15:25.132 --> 15:28.677
[applause]

15:31.263 --> 15:34.183
-[John] Congratulations.
-[Lewis] Appreciate it.

15:34.266 --> 15:35.309
Thank you.

15:37.353 --> 15:40.439
[Tim] A police department is nothing
without the community behind it,

15:40.522 --> 15:44.234
and as you saw the other day when we had
that Reserve Academy graduation,

15:44.318 --> 15:46.820
I tell you, that was such a moving moment.

15:47.279 --> 15:51.075
<i>All the family support that came in</i>
<i>for those reserve officers volunteering...</i>

15:51.158 --> 15:55.412
Now, we not only have the reserve officer
that's a part of the department,

15:55.496 --> 15:59.875
now their family members are gonna be
a part of that police department also.

16:00.501 --> 16:02.586
And it trickles down.

16:07.424 --> 16:08.634
Hey, man.

16:13.597 --> 16:17.434
[Lewis] <i>You've got a lot of young people</i>
<i>out there that want to be police officers</i>

16:17.518 --> 16:21.021
<i>but they have, like,</i>
<i>a follow-the-leader thing.</i>

16:21.105 --> 16:25.526
<i>You know, I'm 65 years old, and there's</i>
<i>nothing wrong with being a volunteer.</i>

16:25.609 --> 16:27.820
<i>I think it takes a very special person</i>

16:27.903 --> 16:30.572
<i>to volunteer their time</i>
<i>to help the community.</i>

16:30.656 --> 16:32.741
<i>You have to have a caring heart.</i>

16:33.492 --> 16:36.203
The Chief said, "Man,
from the bottom of my heart,

16:36.286 --> 16:41.041
it really made me feel good to see
you guys come aboard to help us out."

16:41.125 --> 16:45.337
I guess, being the age we are, you know,
he said that really made...

16:45.421 --> 16:48.007
Man, that was special
when he said that to me.

16:48.090 --> 16:50.759
That was special,
to hear it come from the Chief.

16:56.140 --> 16:58.976
Karen Weaver and Chief Johnson,

17:00.310 --> 17:04.647
you are the most self-serving individuals

17:04.732 --> 17:08.736
that I have ever encountered in my life.

17:09.403 --> 17:13.490
What I have found in the last few weeks

17:13.906 --> 17:16.035
as we did the budget...

17:16.702 --> 17:19.496
It is not all about the community
with you.

17:21.415 --> 17:25.377
People can see it is not. It's about you.

17:26.127 --> 17:27.628
With a deadline two weeks away,

17:27.713 --> 17:32.051
Flint City Council and Mayor Karen Weaver
at odds over a new budget.

17:32.134 --> 17:35.596
City Council recently approved a budget
but Mayor Weaver vetoed it.

17:35.929 --> 17:39.975
We have a Chief of Police that's with
his people, fighting day in and day out.

17:40.059 --> 17:43.771
And to take money from public safety?
I have a problem with that.

17:43.854 --> 17:46.690
[reporter] <i>This is the most angry</i>
<i>I have seen the Chief</i>

17:46.774 --> 17:48.776
<i>since he started in February.</i>

17:48.859 --> 17:51.862
<i>The Council voted</i>
<i>to take money away from the Department,</i>

17:51.945 --> 17:54.740
<i>money he wanted to use</i>
<i>to give his officers a small raise.</i>

17:55.324 --> 17:58.077
<i>They're some of the most</i>
<i>underpaid officers in the country.</i>

17:58.827 --> 18:01.622
As a councilperson, I would not be a part

18:01.705 --> 18:05.918
of moving general fund money
from the Police Department,

18:06.502 --> 18:09.838
and I hope that this
is the last political budget

18:09.922 --> 18:12.174
that I see in the city of Flint.

18:12.257 --> 18:16.095
And if not, then we need
to change some of the players

18:16.178 --> 18:17.679
that sit on this council.

18:17.763 --> 18:18.847
Thank you. Let me just reaffirm,

18:20.474 --> 18:25.062
we have not ever cut the Police Department
or the Fire Department.

18:25.145 --> 18:26.355
We have not.

18:26.814 --> 18:28.690
-[Eric] You just did.
-No, we didn't.

18:28.774 --> 18:32.111
We cut the Chief's budget
in money that he's never spent.

18:32.194 --> 18:35.405
-[Eric] That's the product--
-I didn't interrupt. Quit interrupting.

18:36.323 --> 18:39.326
[reporter] <i>The council are taking care</i>
<i>of some housekeeping issues.</i>

18:39.409 --> 18:42.037
They are expected to adopt a budget
this evening.

18:42.121 --> 18:43.705
We will, of course, be here.

18:43.789 --> 18:47.334
For now, live at Flint City Hall,
I'm Jessica Dupnack, ABC 12 News.

18:49.628 --> 18:52.714
[Tim] <i>You can lie to citizens</i>
<i>and pull the wool over their eyes,</i>

18:52.798 --> 18:55.968
<i>but my eyes is wide open,</i>
<i>and I see the issues.</i>

18:56.051 --> 18:57.302
<i>I'm totally pissed off.</i>

18:57.386 --> 19:01.473
This is how your City Council
is treating our budget.

19:01.890 --> 19:06.186
I can't believe that they would actually
do that to the Police Department.

19:06.270 --> 19:10.190
They know the Department is underbudgeted,
underpaid, the whole nine yards.

19:10.941 --> 19:15.195
<i>Now I've got a job to do, without having</i>
<i>to ever ask City Council for anything,</i>

19:15.279 --> 19:18.615
<i>because we're just not getting it,</i>
<i>and I'm not one for begging.</i>

19:19.199 --> 19:20.951
Like I said, I'm not a politician.

19:21.034 --> 19:24.121
I didn't come begging for a job
and I'm not gonna leave begging.

19:24.204 --> 19:27.541
And as I told City Council, you guys
are really pushing it to the limit.

19:27.624 --> 19:31.962
How long do you think somebody is gonna
keep burning the candle at both ends?

19:32.045 --> 19:33.755
They're gonna get burned out.

19:42.055 --> 19:44.892
[man speaking indistinctly over radio]

19:44.975 --> 19:48.145
Alright, we are moving.
Leaving the house now.

19:49.980 --> 19:53.025
[officer singing about C.A.T.T. squad]

20:01.283 --> 20:06.079
[Esther] I want to know which motherfucker
is gonna unwrap the Christmas presents.

20:06.163 --> 20:09.166
[Esther chortles]

20:11.543 --> 20:13.962
[officer] The C.A.T.T. taking a turn
on the tree!

20:15.339 --> 20:18.091
-[Esther] Yeah!
-[officer] That's what I'm talking about.

20:20.260 --> 20:24.014
[Scott] We'll be turning on the target
in about ten seconds, about ten seconds.

20:25.515 --> 20:29.478
[tense music playing]

20:30.729 --> 20:31.772
[officer] Alright.

20:41.531 --> 20:43.742
[Esther] What have you got for us?

20:44.910 --> 20:47.287
[officer] Check the car!
Check that fucking car!

20:47.871 --> 20:49.039
Check that car.

20:49.122 --> 20:51.541
[officer #2 shouts]
Flint Police! Search warrant!

20:51.625 --> 20:53.669
[door splintering]

20:53.752 --> 20:55.462
[dog barking]

20:55.545 --> 20:57.172

20:57.256 --> 20:58.215
[officer #2] Dog, dog!

20:59.091 --> 21:02.678
Get out here!
Show me your fucking hands.

21:02.761 --> 21:05.430
-[officer] No one in the house.
-[officer #2] Anybody else?

21:05.514 --> 21:08.016
[officer #2] Let me see your hands.
Anybody else in the house?

21:08.600 --> 21:09.977
Dog, dog!

21:10.477 --> 21:12.396

21:12.479 --> 21:13.981
[dog whimpers]

21:14.648 --> 21:16.191
[officer] Are they both down?

21:16.275 --> 21:18.402
Advance forward, over to the steps.

21:19.861 --> 21:23.240
They started shooting,
and I could hear the dogs barking.

21:37.671 --> 21:39.381
[Scott] <i>I used to have fun.</i>

21:40.716 --> 21:43.010
<i>You know, it was fun.</i>

21:45.220 --> 21:47.014
<i>But it's not fun anymore.</i>

21:51.268 --> 21:53.729
<i>I have childhood friends.</i>

21:53.812 --> 21:56.690
<i>They don't really speak to me now,</i>

21:56.773 --> 22:02.195
<i>and it's been in the last couple of years</i>
<i>with the ways things are in society.</i>

22:03.613 --> 22:05.532
-[officer] Killed both?
-[officer #2] Yes.

22:05.949 --> 22:08.327
[man] Damn, man, damn!

22:08.827 --> 22:13.415
I knew this day was coming.
That's the only thing I feared, man.

22:13.498 --> 22:16.710
I hate to have it happen with them
like that, though, man.

22:17.127 --> 22:19.171
They didn't deserve it.

22:21.173 --> 22:23.383
One thing I can always say,

22:24.301 --> 22:26.053
no matter what...

22:27.804 --> 22:30.098
You've never given us a problem.

22:30.849 --> 22:32.976
Never. You never have.

22:35.103 --> 22:39.649
In these 20 years, I've given
at an extremely high level,

22:39.733 --> 22:43.320
but it's not as high as it once was.

22:44.988 --> 22:48.283
<i>Well, I have five years</i>
<i>before I can actually retire.</i>

22:51.119 --> 22:53.789
As a black man in this community,

22:53.872 --> 22:56.625
it's hard for me to leave

22:56.708 --> 23:00.545
because there aren't
very many African American...

23:01.171 --> 23:05.383
males or females,
that want to do the job in this community.

23:06.343 --> 23:08.136
[man] I was waiting on you all.

23:08.220 --> 23:10.555
That's what took me so long
to leave this shit.

23:10.639 --> 23:13.266
You've never caught me
doing it, man, you know?

23:14.518 --> 23:19.189
I've been ready to leave it alone
for the last... at least five years, man.

23:21.108 --> 23:24.945
[Scott] <i>If I leave, there's</i>
<i>a high probability that I'll be replaced</i>

23:25.028 --> 23:28.240
<i>by a white officer</i>
<i>who didn't grow up in this community,</i>

23:28.323 --> 23:30.075
<i>who don't know these people.</i>

23:30.158 --> 23:32.077
[officer] God damn, it's cold.

23:34.287 --> 23:38.125
[Scott] That's one of the things
that still keeps me going,

23:38.208 --> 23:40.627
because who's gonna replace me?

23:42.462 --> 23:47.676
That's a heavy load for a black officer
in this community to carry.

23:48.135 --> 23:49.427
Here.

23:54.349 --> 24:00.438
[ambient music playing]

24:08.071 --> 24:10.699
[officer] That's why the best day
to be born was June 14.

24:10.782 --> 24:13.368
The only thing I share in common
with Donald Trump.

24:13.451 --> 24:17.164
You hear that kid call him a Cheeto?
"We got a Cheeto for a president!"

24:17.247 --> 24:18.748
He do look like a Cheeto.

24:19.791 --> 24:23.295
As much money as he has, there's no way
that toupee should look like that.

24:23.378 --> 24:25.881
[officer #2] They all look like that.

24:25.964 --> 24:29.301
Before we get started also,
Dion's gonna be A-Car tonight.

24:29.384 --> 24:34.556
So if you hear him screaming for help,
go real quick, because he's gonna need it.

24:36.349 --> 24:39.978
-Possibly he needs his diaper changed.
-[Dion] I'm out of diapers now.

24:40.061 --> 24:41.980
-Are you? Pull ups?
-[Dion] Pull ups, yeah.

24:42.063 --> 24:45.483
Today is also Dion's first day
off of DORs.

24:45.567 --> 24:48.111
[officer #2] Dion! Congratulations, Dion! -[Dion] I made it.
-Try not to fuck it up.

24:50.822 --> 24:52.282
[Dion] I'm trying not to.

24:52.616 --> 24:55.702
[Robert] Now you don't have a babysitter,
doesn't mean you can act stupid.

24:55.785 --> 24:58.079
-Yeah, I know that.
-[officer #2] That's true.

Well, I've just seen the one. There was
one shooting inside and this guy outside.

-[Dion] The guard.

It isn't my call.

27:33.943 --> 27:36.154
-[Dion] You're not in trouble.
-[man] I know I'm not.

27:36.237 --> 27:41.159
[man] But I don't want to see no back seat
of the damn police car neither, though.

27:45.205 --> 27:48.750
[Dion] <i>Being a police officer,</i>
<i>it's not what the media shows it as.</i>

27:49.334 --> 27:53.922
<i>I see a lot of police officers</i>
<i>connecting with the community.</i>

27:55.840 --> 27:59.427
<i>Most of the people around here</i>
<i>grew up in a single parent home,</i>

27:59.511 --> 28:01.846
<i>so, you know, I feel like</i>
<i>I can relate to them.</i>

28:03.723 --> 28:07.394
<i>To listen to people more</i>
<i>and to be more patient with people,</i>

28:07.477 --> 28:09.104
<i>that goes a long way.</i>

28:09.562 --> 28:11.856
<i>You have to be</i>
<i>almost like a social worker,</i>

28:11.940 --> 28:14.109
<i>to help people through their problems.</i>

28:22.909 --> 28:26.204
[Devon] I haven't seen this guy
in at least ten years.

28:29.541 --> 28:31.042
He lives right here.

28:31.126 --> 28:34.379
That's him. Same house, same guy.

28:37.382 --> 28:38.883
What's up, Mr. Max?

28:39.509 --> 28:40.719
[Max] Hey, I surrender!

28:41.177 --> 28:43.763
[Devon] Where have you been?
I haven't seen you in a long time.

28:43.847 --> 28:46.015
-Locked up.
-[Devon] Locked up where?

28:46.099 --> 28:48.893
I'll be out of the hospital
three years tomorrow.

28:49.394 --> 28:50.979
I've got to be dealt with!

28:51.062 --> 28:52.772
[Devon] Still living by yourself?

28:52.856 --> 28:55.817
I'm Superfly. My name's Superfly.

28:56.484 --> 28:59.404
Hey, you know about Superfly?
He lives alone.

28:59.487 --> 29:02.115
Mr. Max, what is it
that we can do tonight for you?

29:02.198 --> 29:03.450
[Max] Kill me.

29:03.533 --> 29:06.411
Yeah, that's probably not gonna happen.
So what's plan B?

29:06.494 --> 29:10.123
I'm ready to die.
Today's a good day to die.

29:10.206 --> 29:11.916
Do you want to go to Mental Health?

29:12.000 --> 29:13.376
-They're open?
-[Devon Yeah.

29:13.460 --> 29:16.504
-I've never been to them at night.
-I can take you there.

29:17.130 --> 29:20.091
-In the back seat?
-We can take you in an ambulance.

29:20.175 --> 29:21.968
-I'll go in the ambulance.
-[Devon] Good?

29:22.051 --> 29:25.054
Yeah, I'll go in the ambulance.
I need help. I'm a sick puppy.

29:25.138 --> 29:26.681
I'm a sick puppy!

29:26.765 --> 29:29.476
[Devon] Send me another car.

29:31.394 --> 29:34.189
I already called them
and asked them to be on the way.

29:35.273 --> 29:37.317
You don't need to cry, buddy.

29:37.400 --> 29:39.819
-[Max] It's a good day to die.
-No, sir, it's not.

29:39.903 --> 29:41.070
[Max] A good day to die.

29:41.738 --> 29:44.991
I'm a Pisces.
I don't need water. I'm a Pisces.

29:45.074 --> 29:47.076
I'm full of shit. I'm full of shit!

29:47.160 --> 29:51.998
[Devon] <i>When we come out of the academy,</i>
<i>we can run fast and we know traffic laws.</i>

29:53.458 --> 29:56.169
[Max] Just shoot me.
Shoot me in open daylight.

29:56.252 --> 29:59.130
[Devon] <i>But as a police officer,</i>
<i>especially here,</i>

29:59.214 --> 30:01.716
<i>you have to try and understand people.</i>

30:03.718 --> 30:06.304
[Devon] Mr. Max, we're gonna have you
go in the ambulance.

30:06.387 --> 30:09.766
But you promised you're not gonna
give them any scares, right?

30:09.849 --> 30:12.977
[Max] I'm the big, bad wolf.
Are you Little Red Riding Hood?

30:13.394 --> 30:15.146
I'm the big, bad wolf.

30:15.230 --> 30:17.232
[Devon] <i>There's a very human side</i>

30:17.315 --> 30:21.986
<i>of why people are in</i>
<i>the circumstances that they are in,</i>

30:22.737 --> 30:24.447
<i>and you have to have that empathy.</i>

30:26.324 --> 30:29.869
<i>We have to be the social workers</i>
<i>and the community police officers,</i>

30:31.287 --> 30:35.917
<i>and try and resolve days or years of...</i>

30:36.793 --> 30:37.877
<i>problems,</i>

30:38.211 --> 30:40.755
<i>in 15 minutes,</i>
<i>before we get to the next call.</i>

30:46.427 --> 30:49.889
That's a lot of pressure
on the police.

30:49.973 --> 30:51.683
I think that's a lot of pressure.

30:51.766 --> 30:54.310
There's just not enough of them
for a city this big.

30:54.394 --> 30:57.021
I know that they're overworked,

30:57.105 --> 31:00.191
but I think a lot of it is
just being part of the community,

31:00.775 --> 31:04.445
and not being scared to be part
of that community in which you serve.

31:05.113 --> 31:09.367
We kind of need to go back
to the good old days,

31:09.450 --> 31:12.453
when police were in your neighborhood. They were walking the streets.
You had a relationship.

31:15.623 --> 31:17.792
They knew your name.
You knew their name.

31:18.293 --> 31:22.630
That's where we get to that...
police and community bridge.

31:23.131 --> 31:26.843
People want to see them on the streets.
They want help with their communities.

31:26.926 --> 31:28.928
If you're not gonna get out of that car

31:29.012 --> 31:32.724
and meet with those people on their porch
or in their backyard barbecue,

31:32.807 --> 31:34.350
to me, that's not gonna work.

31:34.434 --> 31:38.438
If the only time you see the police,
they're chasing Joe Blow down the street

31:38.521 --> 31:42.317
and they're doing 90 miles an hour,
it isn't gonna work.

31:45.069 --> 31:50.575
[soft ambient music playing]

31:58.416 --> 32:00.835
[Robert] This will be
our drive home from work.

32:07.050 --> 32:09.260
[Bridgette] I can't wait to get our keys.

32:11.596 --> 32:14.474
-[Robert] There's our house.
-[Bridgette] This is our house.

32:14.557 --> 32:17.060
[Bridgette] It has the sign in the front
that says "sold."

32:17.143 --> 32:18.978
We've got to get a picture with it.

32:20.355 --> 32:23.107
[Bridgette] <i>I'm very happy, very excited.</i>

32:23.775 --> 32:25.318
It's, like, the biggest thing.

32:25.735 --> 32:28.905
Everybody thought that we had
got married, which we didn't,

32:28.988 --> 32:31.658
but I was telling people,
"We bought a house instead."

32:31.741 --> 32:32.909
They're like, "Oh."

32:33.451 --> 32:35.787
[Robert] Looks like a house
big enough for a family.

32:37.538 --> 32:38.998
In the middle of the country. [Bridgette] Does it work?

32:42.794 --> 32:45.713
[Robert] Yeah, it does work.
I just don't know what I'm doing.

32:50.176 --> 32:52.845
[Bridgette] <i>This move</i>
<i>has really been more for me.</i>

32:52.929 --> 32:55.890
I wasn't necessarily happy
living where we were.

32:55.974 --> 33:00.979
It was just so far from my family,
and kind of in the middle of nowhere.

33:02.730 --> 33:03.606
[Robert] <i>Yes? No?</i>

33:03.690 --> 33:06.693
-[Bridgette] Don't hit the light.
-[Robert] I'm not gonna hit the light.

33:06.776 --> 33:07.652
At least it's just us.

33:07.735 --> 33:09.112
[pop]

33:13.408 --> 33:16.119
-[Robert] And we're ghetto.
-[Bridgette] As I open the title...

33:16.911 --> 33:20.331
[Robert] I'm pouring whatever this is
into orange juice.

33:27.755 --> 33:30.883
[Bridgette] <i>I pulled my application</i>
<i>from the FBI,</i>

33:30.967 --> 33:33.970
<i>but that door</i>
<i>isn't necessarily closed either.</i>

33:34.053 --> 33:36.055
<i>That would be an amazing job.</i>

33:37.265 --> 33:41.185
But that would be moving away,
traveling all the time.

33:41.269 --> 33:43.604
I know they travel like crazy.

33:46.691 --> 33:48.067
But it would be fun.

33:49.610 --> 33:52.989
-[Robert] Cleaner than ours?
-[Bridgette] Yeah, and it probably works.

33:53.072 --> 33:55.783
-[Robert] Way better!
-I know.

33:57.785 --> 34:02.623
Here's this amazing, wonderful woman
I'm madly in love with, and...

34:03.332 --> 34:06.252
we don't want to constantly
be talking about work.

34:06.335 --> 34:09.088
We don't want to constantly
be talking about scary stuff.

34:09.172 --> 34:11.382
Sometimes you just want
to shove it in a closet

34:11.466 --> 34:13.551
and pretend it doesn't exist for a while.

34:15.219 --> 34:17.972
[Bridgette] Rob, come look at this.
Come here!

34:18.056 --> 34:19.599
[Robert] I'm coming.

34:20.141 --> 34:22.601
-[Bridgette] Look.
-[Robert] Yeah.

34:23.061 --> 34:24.687
[Bridgette] Think of this in summer.

34:25.396 --> 34:27.106
[Robert] Think of this right now.

34:30.318 --> 34:32.445
I'm sure she still wants to go.

34:37.366 --> 34:39.702
<i>But... she's still here.</i>

34:41.871 --> 34:43.790
[Bridgette] Let's go inside. I'm freezing.

34:46.793 --> 34:48.585
[Robert] OK, yeah. I'm cold.

34:52.924 --> 34:55.967
[newsreader] <i>Mayor Karen Weaver</i>
<i>and the City Council squaring off again</i>

34:56.052 --> 34:58.179
<i>over money and this year's budget.</i>

34:58.262 --> 35:01.015
[reporter] <i>...especially</i>
<i>after last November's millage</i>

35:01.099 --> 35:03.601
<i>that helped increase</i>
<i>public safety efforts.</i>

35:03.684 --> 35:08.689
<i>Council passed the budget that included</i>
<i>the transfer of some police funds.</i>

35:08.773 --> 35:13.194
Now RTAB, that's the state board that
oversees a lot of the City's spending,

35:13.277 --> 35:16.489
they say it's solely up to Mayor Weaver
and City Council

35:16.572 --> 35:18.157
to get that budget passed.

35:18.241 --> 35:21.160
<i>And one of the big sticking points?</i>
<i>Public safety.</i>

35:29.335 --> 35:31.087
[Chairman] First item is the roll call.

35:32.004 --> 35:34.590
Mayor, or Councilman Kincaid?

35:39.762 --> 35:44.600
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and board members.
I just wanted to address you.

35:44.684 --> 35:46.269
There are a couple of things.

35:46.352 --> 35:50.398
The City Council adopted a budget
on Monday, June 5th,

35:50.481 --> 35:54.443
and yesterday at 2 o'clock,
the Mayor vetoed that budget.

35:54.944 --> 35:58.364
I can assure you
that this budget is balanced,

35:58.447 --> 36:01.492
and those two areas that we cut

36:01.951 --> 36:03.911
did not affect public safety at all.

36:03.995 --> 36:08.374
That was the concern of City council -
not to affect public safety.

36:11.169 --> 36:14.255
You know, the legislative branch
and the executive branch

36:14.338 --> 36:16.674
are always going to have some differences.

36:18.092 --> 36:19.427
When Mayor Weaver came in,

36:20.469 --> 36:22.930
she was trying to, you know...

36:23.806 --> 36:25.141
make a change.

36:26.392 --> 36:30.271
<i>My position as a representative</i>
<i>on the City Council?</i>

36:30.771 --> 36:34.108
<i>You know, we don't put the budget together</i>
<i>for the Police Department.</i>

36:34.483 --> 36:37.069
<i>The Police Department</i>
<i>puts their budget together.</i>

36:37.945 --> 36:40.489
And I don't want to get
into a debate or an argument,

36:40.573 --> 36:45.703
but if the Chief wanted money in Patrol
or Detective Bureau or somewhere else,

36:46.621 --> 36:50.875
you know, it was his responsibility
to present that to the City Council,

36:50.958 --> 36:53.419
and my point is that he failed to do that.

36:54.128 --> 36:58.674
I don't have a clear picture as to what
the position of the administration is.

36:58.758 --> 37:01.761
Is there a consensus
in the administration and the Council

37:01.844 --> 37:04.138
that, yes, this is what we want to do?

37:04.472 --> 37:06.724
[Karen] I just want
to set a couple things straight,

37:06.807 --> 37:09.685
when we were talking about
the changes made for the budget.

37:09.769 --> 37:11.896
We do have concerns about public safety,

37:11.979 --> 37:15.191
and we also have some concerns
about public health and capacity,

37:15.274 --> 37:18.444
and I think the Chief of Police
wants to address that.

37:20.029 --> 37:21.948
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

37:23.699 --> 37:25.576
I went to the people in Flint,

37:25.660 --> 37:29.956
and I asked them to support a millage
to keep police officers on the street,

37:30.039 --> 37:32.458
because we were so understaffed
when I got...

37:34.001 --> 37:35.336
I was put in this position.

37:35.962 --> 37:39.173
I'm personally feeling like
I've been kicked in my stomach.

37:39.257 --> 37:41.926
I've been stripped, and I've been cheated.

37:42.009 --> 37:44.679
And I feel like I lied
to the citizens in this city.

37:46.013 --> 37:49.850
The police officers on the Flint Police
Department are underpaid,

37:49.934 --> 37:53.604
understaffed, wearing five and six hats.

37:53.688 --> 37:57.858
They're working with primitive equipment.
I've asked for cars, haven't gotten them.

37:57.942 --> 38:00.278
I'm teaming up four officers
to go out in one car.

38:01.070 --> 38:04.282
I stand before you and listen
to people talk, and I tell you,

38:04.365 --> 38:07.702
I've always wondered why this city
was under such a black cloud

38:07.785 --> 38:10.246
and why we could never get up
off the ground.

38:10.329 --> 38:13.249
When you stand here and hear people
say things that's not true,

38:13.332 --> 38:15.001
or manipulating the facts,

38:15.084 --> 38:18.129
or giving you a false conception
of what's going on in this city,

38:18.212 --> 38:19.422
it's just mind-blowing.

38:19.505 --> 38:20.631
It's mind-blowing.

38:20.715 --> 38:24.760
I've always wondered why this city was in
the position that it was. Now I see why.

38:24.844 --> 38:28.764
I see why. It's at the top.
That's the problem. It's at the top.

38:29.265 --> 38:30.933
My staff can deal with the streets.

38:31.017 --> 38:32.977
Our numbers speak for themselves.

38:34.186 --> 38:36.022
With a primitive department,

38:36.480 --> 38:40.443
these officers are holding that front line
like I've asked them to do,

38:41.110 --> 38:42.820
and I feel like I cheated them, also.

38:43.487 --> 38:46.657
When I go to City Council and ask
for certain things, I don't get it.

38:46.741 --> 38:48.534
The majority of time, I don't get it.

38:49.076 --> 38:51.746
And like I said before to City Council,

38:52.747 --> 38:54.290
my battle is on the street,

38:54.373 --> 38:58.085
but if you want to bring me in your house,
I'll be there. I'm at your front door now.

38:58.169 --> 39:00.838
And it's not gonna change,
and I'm not gonna go away.

39:01.339 --> 39:03.090
Matter of fact, when I get finished,

39:03.174 --> 39:06.427
it's gonna be a shame what you brought me
in your house to clean up,

39:06.510 --> 39:09.555
because I'm gonna clean it up
as long as I'm wearing this uniform.

39:11.140 --> 39:14.810
So I say to you people,
the board members, RTAB,

39:15.269 --> 39:17.355
every penny that
that police department has,

39:17.438 --> 39:18.647
they need it in the budget.

39:19.190 --> 39:22.360
I'm gonna stand behind my officers 100%,

39:22.443 --> 39:26.155
because they're gonna give us
the job that we need to get done.

39:26.530 --> 39:29.367
But working with this administration
has been total hell.

39:33.162 --> 39:34.997
-[chairman] Chief...
-So, I asked you...

39:35.748 --> 39:39.126
I don't know if you have anything to do
with keeping money in our budget,

39:39.210 --> 39:41.712
but we need that money
for the Police Department,

39:41.796 --> 39:44.423
and I ask if you can leave it there,
then please do.

39:44.507 --> 39:47.718
And if you don't have anything
to do with it, thank you for your time.

39:47.802 --> 39:49.595
I'm sorry for interrupting you, sir.

39:49.678 --> 39:52.431
[chairman] Yeah.
We appreciate your comments.

39:52.515 --> 39:56.102
We appreciate having members
of your department here, as I indicated,

39:56.644 --> 39:59.605
and we hope whatever budget
they bring to us

39:59.688 --> 40:02.149
will be satisfactory to you
and your department

40:02.233 --> 40:04.652
and residents of the City of Flint.

40:04.735 --> 40:06.987
[Tim] I doubt that's going to be reached.

40:07.071 --> 40:08.864
Not with this current administration.

40:09.407 --> 40:12.952
-[chairman] Well, I'm an optimist.
-I pray to God they do.

40:18.249 --> 40:21.210
[woman] <i>Our fiscal year...</i>
<i>Our fiscal year does end...</i>

40:21.293 --> 40:26.340
[soft ambient music playing]

40:29.218 --> 40:33.305
[chattering in background]

41:04.420 --> 41:08.841
[church choir singing]

41:10.968 --> 41:12.178
[Brian] Amen.

41:13.304 --> 41:17.016
You know, and so even
in our great city of Flint,

41:18.017 --> 41:20.853
right now, with the poverty
and the violence,

41:20.936 --> 41:24.648
then General Motors lost,
and now this water crisis,

41:25.399 --> 41:28.110
some folk are writing off this city.

41:30.863 --> 41:34.241
<i>If they're not writing off the city,</i>
<i>they're writing off neighborhoods</i>

41:34.325 --> 41:36.994
<i>and saying some neighborhoods</i>
<i>will not make it.</i>

41:38.412 --> 41:41.832
<i>If they're not writing off neighborhoods</i>
<i>they're writing off individuals,</i>

41:42.166 --> 41:44.418
<i>saying that they won't make it.</i>

41:45.586 --> 41:49.381
<i>But I believe that Flint</i>
<i>will prove to be bigger</i>

41:49.465 --> 41:51.884
<i>than this struggle</i>
<i>that it's going through right now.</i>

41:52.927 --> 41:54.178
<i>Amen.</i>

41:54.261 --> 41:56.222
[applause]

41:56.305 --> 42:00.142
[Brian] <i>I believe that Flint will be</i>
<i>bigger than her crisis.</i>

42:01.977 --> 42:03.145
Amen.

42:06.565 --> 42:10.027
[Tim] <i>I've always said,</i>
<i>I'm not a politician. I'm a crime fighter.</i>

42:10.903 --> 42:14.532
I can fight crime all day long
and go home with a smile on my face.

42:14.615 --> 42:18.661
But when you fight people who are supposed
to have the citizens' interests at heart,

42:19.161 --> 42:21.539
and you find out that really
that's not the case,

42:22.081 --> 42:23.749
that's a hard pill to swallow.

42:26.001 --> 42:29.964
The city of Flint, the people,
are they pissed? Fuck yeah. Pissed.

42:30.047 --> 42:31.048
I'm pissed.

42:31.799 --> 42:35.844
The community expects that
when they pick up the phone to call 911,

42:35.928 --> 42:36.929
an officer shows up.

42:37.012 --> 42:37.972
Hell, I expect it.

42:38.264 --> 42:41.392
<i>When do you call the police?</i>
<i>When you need them, when something's bad.</i>

42:41.475 --> 42:44.853
<i>Someone's hurt, something's going on</i>
<i>and you need the officers.</i>

42:45.187 --> 42:47.064
We did not provide that service to them.

42:48.399 --> 42:50.859
[Kevin] <i>And you throw in there</i>
<i>a water crisis.</i>

42:50.943 --> 42:54.405
How is there not civil unrest?
How is there not?

42:55.864 --> 42:58.534
We have to show people
that we're human, too,

42:59.285 --> 43:01.537
and this is more than just a job.

43:03.831 --> 43:06.250
[Tim] <i>Right now, we still have</i>
<i>a crime problem in the city.</i> <i>In my opinion, it's still out of control.</i>

43:10.588 --> 43:12.298
<i>So, it's a fight.</i>

43:12.381 --> 43:15.050
The place is falling down
but we're still holding that banner.

43:23.225 --> 43:26.937
[Robert] <i>You go out and see it everywhere.</i>
<i>They say "Flint grit," you know?</i>

43:27.021 --> 43:29.023
<i>And it really is. It's a tough town.</i>

43:29.565 --> 43:31.150
I mean, it's tough to live in,

43:31.233 --> 43:32.484
it's tough to work in,

43:32.568 --> 43:34.486
but also, the people in it are just tough.

43:36.822 --> 43:39.617
[Bridgette] <i>You know,</i>
<i>the option to leave is always there.</i>

43:39.700 --> 43:41.619
<i>And I know neither one of us want to.</i>

43:41.702 --> 43:45.623
Because we both believe in this job,
in the city, in the department,

43:45.706 --> 43:47.666
and we both want to stay.

43:48.917 --> 43:52.212
This is a story about an American City
in critical condition.

43:54.590 --> 43:58.385
[Brian] We live in
the most powerful nation in the world,

43:58.469 --> 44:03.307
that could make any number of investments
in an urban area

44:03.390 --> 44:06.435
and turn it around,
but it chooses not to,

44:07.061 --> 44:11.607
because poverty is not
on the agenda of America.

44:12.441 --> 44:15.069
The fear is that what's ailing this city

44:15.152 --> 44:17.279
could become an epidemic
around the country.

44:24.453 --> 44:26.163
[Keith] The bigger issue, man, is,

44:26.246 --> 44:29.458
my mother is still using
bottled and filtered water.

44:29.541 --> 44:30.668
That's the bigger issue.

44:31.085 --> 44:33.504
[crowd chanting] <i>Three, two, one.</i>

44:33.962 --> 44:35.005
What the fuck?

44:35.964 --> 44:39.093
[Brian] <i>The political leadership has</i>
<i>done us something way more violent</i>

44:39.176 --> 44:42.262
<i>than what we accuse</i>
<i>people on the street of doing.</i>

44:42.346 --> 44:44.932
-Here's to Flint.
-[all] To Flint. Hear, hear!

44:46.975 --> 44:49.144
What will be the consequence...

44:50.229 --> 44:51.522
for them?

44:54.858 --> 44:57.152
<i>And what will justice look like, for...</i>

44:58.362 --> 45:00.072
<i>the people of Flint, beyond that?</i>

45:00.155 --> 45:01.740
<i>What does that look like?</i>

45:07.913 --> 45:10.999
Sometimes it's hard
to see the light at the end of the tunnel,

45:11.875 --> 45:14.837
and sometimes when you think
it's getting close, it gets longer.
