00:01.685 --> 00:03.686
Hey, Leonard, check this out.

00:08.230 --> 00:10.232
Leonard, she's doing it again.

00:11.402 --> 00:13.904
I think it upsets Sheldon
when you play with the food.

00:13.905 --> 00:14.984
No.

00:15.040 --> 00:17.342
It upsets Sheldon
when she willy-nilly takes it

00:17.343 --> 00:20.693
from the containers without regard
for its equitable distribution.

00:21.171 --> 00:24.182
This is essentially why
you have famine in India.

00:26.217 --> 00:28.659
You want me to put it back?

00:29.941 --> 00:30.621
Leonard.

00:30.622 --> 00:34.495
It upsets Sheldon when you
play with the Sheldon.

00:35.697 --> 00:38.999
What's up, my nerdizzles?

00:39.000 --> 00:40.333
Raj, Sheldon,

00:40.334 --> 00:42.269
I want you to meet my
girlfriend Bernadette.

00:42.270 --> 00:43.336
- Hello.
- Leonard, Penny,

00:43.337 --> 00:45.039
you know my girlfriend Bernadette.

00:45.040 --> 00:45.947
Yeah. Hey.

00:45.982 --> 00:48.608
Bernadette, say fo'shizzle
to my nerdizzles.

00:49.644 --> 00:52.179
I don't think I can.

00:52.180 --> 00:54.815
I don't have Howard's street cred.

00:55.919 --> 00:56.281
I hope it's all right...

00:56.316 --> 00:59.584
I told my girlfriend Bernadette
she could join us for dinner.

00:59.620 --> 01:01.518
- Sure. The more, the merrier.
- Wait, no,

01:01.553 --> 01:04.522
that's a false equivalency.
More does not equal merry.

01:04.525 --> 01:07.027
If there were 2,000 people
in this apartment right now,

01:07.028 --> 01:09.630
would we be celebrating?
No, we'd be suffocating.

01:09.631 --> 01:11.365
- Sheldon...
- Don't "Sheldon" me.

01:11.400 --> 01:14.128
- We ordered for five people, not six.
- Oh, come on, it's fine.

01:14.163 --> 01:16.206
We'll just put it all on the
table, you know, family style.

01:16.241 --> 01:19.251
Oh, sure. And while we're at it, why don't
we put our hands behind our backs,

01:19.286 --> 01:21.708
and have an old-fashioned eating contest?

01:22.108 --> 01:24.077
Relax, it'll be fine.
Sit down, you guys.

01:26.615 --> 01:27.615
- No! No!
- No!

01:27.616 --> 01:28.447
What?!

01:30.251 --> 01:32.983
- Oh, yeah, you can't sit there.
- Why not?

01:33.018 --> 01:36.287
- That's where Sheldon sits.
- He can't sit somewhere else?

01:37.857 --> 01:39.362
No, no, no...
You see, in the winter,

01:39.397 --> 01:41.893
that seat is close enough to
the radiator so that he's warm,

01:41.894 --> 01:43.328
yet not so close that he sweats.

01:43.329 --> 01:45.708
In the summer,
it's directly in the path of a cross-breeze

01:45.743 --> 01:47.699
created by opening windows there and there.

01:47.700 --> 01:50.036
It faces the television
at an angle that isn't direct,

01:50.037 --> 01:51.531
so he can still talk to everybody, yet

01:51.566 --> 01:55.172
not so wide that the picture
looks distorted.

01:57.743 --> 02:00.444
Perhaps there's hope for you after all.

Season 3 Episode 10
The Gorilla Experiment

02:28.285 --> 02:31.387
- Ooh, I love your shoes.
- Oh, thanks. They are cute, aren't they?

02:31.422 --> 02:33.361
- Where'd you get them?
- Shoes for Less.

02:33.390 --> 02:36.906
- I've been meaning to go over there.
- Oh, great selection, great prices.

02:38.194 --> 02:41.496
My mother was right.
Hell is real.

02:42.298 --> 02:45.333
Come on, Sheldon.
Let the womenfolk chat.

02:48.025 --> 02:49.213
Womenfolk?

02:49.305 --> 02:51.165
Gals?
Chicks?

02:51.574 --> 02:53.815
Utero-Americans?

02:54.976 --> 02:56.977
Just eat your dinner.

02:57.012 --> 02:58.745
Don't take him too seriously.

02:58.746 --> 03:02.516
A lot of what he says
is intended as humor.

03:02.517 --> 03:04.819
Yeah, well, I don't
think it's very funny.

03:04.820 --> 03:08.421
Me neither, but he just
lights up when I laugh.

03:10.624 --> 03:13.359
Howard, never let her go.

03:15.394 --> 03:18.998
So, Leonard, Howard says you're working on
fundamental tests of quantum mechanics.

03:18.999 --> 03:21.534
I am.
Are you interested in physics?

03:21.535 --> 03:22.901
Oh, I find it fascinating.

03:22.902 --> 03:27.071
If I hadn't gone into microbiology,
I probably would have gone into physics.

03:27.072 --> 03:29.974
Or ice dancing.

03:29.975 --> 03:32.014
Actually, my tests of the Aharonov-Bohm

03:32.042 --> 03:34.644
quantum interference effect have
reached an interesting point.

03:34.645 --> 03:37.547
Right now, we're testing the phase shift
due to an electric potential.

03:37.548 --> 03:39.982
- That's amazing.
- <i>Yes.</i>

03:39.983 --> 03:41.645
Leonard's work is nearly as amazing

03:41.646 --> 03:44.986
as third graders growing
lima beans in wet paper towels.

03:46.989 --> 03:49.490
While I appreciate the "Oh, snap,"

03:49.491 --> 03:52.161
I'm uncomfortable having
your moist breath in my ear.

03:55.330 --> 03:59.499
Are you going to try to set up
the voltages using tunnel junctions?

04:00.501 --> 04:01.669
Yes, I am.

04:01.670 --> 04:03.704
You want to see a simulation
on my laptop?

04:03.705 --> 04:05.238
Oh, yeah, show me.

04:05.239 --> 04:09.841
In microbiology, the most exciting thing
I get to work with is yeast.

04:09.842 --> 04:12.711
- <i>Howard?</i>
- Yeah?

04:12.712 --> 04:15.380
Your shoes are delightful.

04:16.783 --> 04:20.185
Where did you get them?

04:20.185 --> 04:21.086
What?

04:21.087 --> 04:23.354
Bazinga. I don't care.

04:31.331 --> 04:34.866
Ha! Eat my dust,
racially stereotypical plumber.

04:38.320 --> 04:39.605
That's not fair.

04:39.606 --> 04:43.227
- I got stuck behind a tree.
- And a cow and a penguin.

04:44.181 --> 04:45.211
Face it, dude,

04:45.212 --> 04:47.712
whether it's a real car
or a virtual cartoon car,

04:47.713 --> 04:49.044
you can't drive.

04:50.015 --> 04:51.783
Just need a little more practice.

04:51.784 --> 04:55.253
What you need is cheat codes,
motor skills and a magic genie

04:55.254 --> 04:58.755
who grants wishes to little boys
who suck at Mario Kart.

05:01.403 --> 05:03.761
Hey, Sheldon, can I talk
to you for a second?

05:03.762 --> 05:06.395
It's not about shoes, is it?

05:06.396 --> 05:08.599
I don't think I could
go through that again.

05:08.600 --> 05:11.366
- It's not about shoes.
- Then speak.

05:11.367 --> 05:14.938
- Um, actually, can we do it in private?
- All right.

05:15.574 --> 05:17.405
Go away.

05:18.810 --> 05:22.909
I agree, it's rude,
but she asked for privacy.

05:22.910 --> 05:24.044
<i>Thanks, Raj.</i>

05:24.045 --> 05:26.848
Okay, so here's the thing:

05:26.849 --> 05:30.484
I was wondering if you could
maybe teach me a little physics?

05:30.485 --> 05:35.200
A <i>little</i> physics?
There's no such thing.

05:35.201 --> 05:40.160
Physics encompasses the entire universe,
from quantum particles to supernovas,

05:40.161 --> 05:42.885
from spinning electrons
to spinning galaxies.

05:42.965 --> 05:45.699
Yeah, okay, cool.
I don't need the PBS special.

05:46.251 --> 05:49.236
I just want to know enough so I can
talk to Leonard about his job.

05:49.237 --> 05:50.670
You know, like Bernadette does.

05:50.671 --> 05:53.808
- Why can't Leonard teach you?
- 'Cause I want to surprise him.

05:53.809 --> 05:55.678
Can't you surprise him in some other way?

05:55.709 --> 06:00.146
For example, I'm sure he'd be delightfully
taken aback if you cleaned your apartment.

06:01.005 --> 06:03.140
Come on, Sheldon,
this is important to me.

06:03.175 --> 06:05.302
Penny, this would be a massive undertaking,

06:05.303 --> 06:08.120
and my time is both limited and valuable.

06:08.121 --> 06:10.589
You're sitting here
playing video games all day.

06:11.657 --> 06:13.158
Okay, point.

06:14.460 --> 06:16.594
What sort of foundation do you have?

06:16.595 --> 06:19.029
Did you take any science
classes in school?

06:19.030 --> 06:21.131
Sure.
I did the one with the frogs.

06:24.167 --> 06:27.036
The one with the frogs.

06:27.037 --> 06:28.438
Yeah, actually,
it was pretty cool.

06:28.439 --> 06:31.507
A lot of the girls threw up,
but I gutted that thing like a deer.

06:31.508 --> 06:33.141
I'm sorry, Penny.

06:33.142 --> 06:35.642
- I don't think so.
- Oh, come on!

06:35.643 --> 06:37.478
A smart guy like you,
it'll be a challenge.

06:37.479 --> 06:38.881
You can make it like an experiment.

06:40.916 --> 06:43.351
Interesting.

06:43.352 --> 06:48.621
I suppose if someone could teach
sign language to KoKo the gorilla...

06:48.622 --> 06:51.024
I could teach you
some rudimentary physics.

06:51.025 --> 06:52.059
Great!

06:52.060 --> 06:54.293
It's a little insulting, but great.

06:54.294 --> 06:56.495
- I'll be KoKo.
- Not likely.

06:56.496 --> 06:58.429
KoKo learned to understand
over 2,000 words,

06:58.430 --> 07:02.069
not one of which had
anything to do with shoes.

07:03.435 --> 07:04.703
Hey, fellas.

07:04.704 --> 07:06.838
This is my girlfriend Bernadette.

07:06.839 --> 07:09.574
My girlfriend Bernadette.

07:09.575 --> 07:12.176
- Who are all those people?
- Have no idea.

07:12.177 --> 07:14.177
Hey, Leonard.

07:14.178 --> 07:15.647
- Hi.
- Hey, look,

07:15.648 --> 07:18.281
it's Howard and his
girlfriend Bernadette.

07:18.282 --> 07:21.817
Thought I'd give the little woman
a tour of the old salt mines.

07:21.818 --> 07:24.386
He doesn't mean salt mines.

07:24.387 --> 07:27.056
He means where he works.

07:27.057 --> 07:29.558
Yeah, no, I got it.

07:31.094 --> 07:33.328
So, how's your experiment going?

07:33.329 --> 07:34.664
Ah, terrific.

07:34.665 --> 07:36.065
We're getting the electron
accelerator set up.

07:36.066 --> 07:37.999
We should be ready to go
day after tomorrow.

07:38.000 --> 07:41.101
- Boy, I'd love to see that.
- You're welcome to come.

07:41.102 --> 07:43.237
Really?
Oh, that'd be great.

07:43.238 --> 07:46.456
- How exciting is that?
- Like Hanukkah in July.

07:48.413 --> 07:49.910
Do they have that?

07:50.979 --> 07:53.516
No.

07:53.517 --> 07:56.350
Oh.
You got me again.

07:58.420 --> 08:00.887
This isn't non-fat yogurt.

08:00.888 --> 08:03.059
This is fatty fat fat.

08:03.094 --> 08:04.155
Excuse me.

08:04.326 --> 08:06.259
Could you grab me
another napkin, sweetie?

08:06.260 --> 08:07.990
- Sure.
- Thanks, honey.

08:09.263 --> 08:11.665
All right, what is your deal?

08:11.666 --> 08:13.033
Excuse me?

08:13.034 --> 08:16.736
Inviting my girlfriend to come see
your electron accelerator?

08:16.737 --> 08:18.437
Yeah? So?

08:18.438 --> 08:20.005
Wow!

08:20.006 --> 08:23.176
You really are a piece of work.

08:23.177 --> 08:25.255
It's not enough you get the prom queen,

08:25.256 --> 08:28.378
you have to get the head of
the decorating committee, too?

08:28.379 --> 08:32.249
- What are you talking about?
- Don't play innocent with me.

08:32.250 --> 08:37.219
I practically invented using
fancy lab equipment to seduce women.

08:37.220 --> 08:41.357
- Has it ever worked?
- Not so far, but that's not the point!

08:41.359 --> 08:45.294
Howard, relax.
I'm not interested in your girlfriend.

08:45.295 --> 08:49.530
I hope not.
Because you don't want to mess with me.

08:54.437 --> 08:56.465
I'm crazy.

08:58.624 --> 09:00.775
I believe you.

09:02.111 --> 09:04.579
<i>Research journal, entry one.</i>

09:04.580 --> 09:06.180
<i>I'm about to embark on one of</i>

09:06.181 --> 09:10.518
<i>the great challenges
of my scientific career:</i>

09:10.519 --> 09:14.220
<i>teaching Penny physics.</i>

09:14.221 --> 09:17.074
<i>I'm calling it Project Gorilla.</i>

09:19.103 --> 09:22.408
- Hey, Sheldon.
- Come in. Take a seat.

09:23.130 --> 09:25.598
<i>Subject has arrived.</i>

09:25.599 --> 09:28.935
<i>I've extended
a friendly casual greeting.</i>

09:28.936 --> 09:31.737
- Ready to get started?
- One moment.

09:36.241 --> 09:40.477
<i>Subject appears well-rested
and enthusiastic.</i>

09:40.478 --> 09:42.479
<i>Apparently, ignorance is bliss.</i>

09:45.049 --> 09:48.452
All right, let us begin.

09:48.453 --> 09:50.123
Where's your notebook?

09:50.124 --> 09:52.155
Um, I don't have one.

09:52.156 --> 09:54.657
How are you going to take notes
without a notebook?

09:54.658 --> 09:56.559
I have to take notes?

09:56.560 --> 09:58.894
How else are you gonna
study for the tests?

09:58.895 --> 10:02.664
- There's gonna be a test?
- Test-sss.

10:04.634 --> 10:06.201
Here.

10:06.202 --> 10:09.003
It's college-ruled.
I hope that's not too intimidating.

10:12.042 --> 10:14.143
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

10:14.144 --> 10:16.044
Now, Introduction to Physics.

10:16.045 --> 10:18.913
What is physics?

10:18.914 --> 10:22.818
Physics comes from the
ancient Greek word "physika. "

10:24.953 --> 10:27.221
It's at this point that you'll
want to start taking notes.

10:29.491 --> 10:32.626
"Physika" means the science
of natural things.

10:32.627 --> 10:36.729
And it is there, in ancient
Greece, that our story begins.

10:36.730 --> 10:38.401
- Ancient Greece?!
- Hush.

10:38.402 --> 10:40.400
If you have questions, raise your hand.

10:41.734 --> 10:45.236
It's a warm summer evening, circa 600 BC.

10:45.237 --> 10:49.240
You've finished your shopping
at the local market, or agora...

10:52.911 --> 10:55.148
...and you look up at the night sky.

10:55.149 --> 10:58.851
There you notice some
of the stars seem to move,

10:58.852 --> 11:03.454
so you name them "planetes,"
or "wanderer. "

11:09.694 --> 11:10.694
Yes, Penny?

11:10.695 --> 11:13.931
Um, does this have anything to do
with Leonard's work?

11:13.932 --> 11:19.173
This is the beginning of a 2,600-year
journey we're going to take together from...

11:20.116 --> 11:24.530
the ancient Greeks through
Isaac Newton to Niels Bohr

11:24.565 --> 11:27.252
to Erwin Schrodinger
to the Dutch researchers

11:27.253 --> 11:29.512
that Leonard is currently ripping off.

11:31.072 --> 11:33.750
- 2,600 years?
- Yeah, give or take.

11:33.850 --> 11:38.253
As I was saying, it's a warm
summer evening in ancient Greece...

11:38.810 --> 11:41.957
- Yes, Penny?
- I have to go to the bathroom.

11:41.958 --> 11:45.827
- Can't you hold it?
- Not for 2,600 years.

11:55.104 --> 11:57.873
<i>Project Gorilla, entry two.</i>

11:57.874 --> 12:00.073
<i>I am exhausted.</i>

12:16.738 --> 12:18.418
- Howard?
- Huh?

12:18.453 --> 12:20.237
It unhooks in the front.

12:21.175 --> 12:24.010
Oh, that explains a lot.

12:26.747 --> 12:30.817
<i>Howard, I'm home!</i>

12:30.818 --> 12:33.052
Of course.

12:33.053 --> 12:35.854
Senior fitness was cancelled.

12:35.855 --> 12:39.351
It turns out you can
forget how to ride a bike.

12:39.812 --> 12:44.729
I'm fine, but, oy,
did Sam Harpootian eat gravel.

12:45.312 --> 12:46.781
That's great, Ma!

12:46.816 --> 12:49.902
What's great about an
80-year-old Armenian man

12:49.903 --> 12:52.637
with half his chin scraped off?!

12:53.295 --> 12:55.172
- I guess I should go.
- No, no, don't move.

12:55.574 --> 12:58.643
Hey, Ma, can I have lamb stew for dinner?

12:58.644 --> 13:02.145
Lamb stew?
I'd have to go to the supermarket.

13:02.146 --> 13:03.381
Please?

13:03.382 --> 13:05.349
I got a real hankering.

13:07.721 --> 13:12.523
Oh, I can't say no
to my little tushy face.

13:12.929 --> 13:15.201
I'll be back soon.

13:15.236 --> 13:16.969
Thanks, Ma.

13:18.762 --> 13:21.964
Do you want the regular peas
or the Le Seur?

13:21.965 --> 13:25.267
Always Le Seur peas with lamb stew!

13:25.268 --> 13:28.203
You're right!
When you're right, you're right!

13:30.573 --> 13:34.014
- What if they're out of the Le Seur?
- Then get the regular!

13:35.071 --> 13:37.913
All right!
You don't have to yell!

13:39.348 --> 13:41.683
Sorry about that.

13:44.435 --> 13:47.354
- Let me just put that on vibrate.
- I'm already on vibrate.

13:49.390 --> 13:51.091
You know, that one I got.

13:52.760 --> 13:55.161
Howard, did you say something
to Leonard about me?

13:55.162 --> 13:56.562
Uh, what do you mean?

13:56.563 --> 14:00.469
He says if I go see his experiment
tomorrow it might weird you out.

14:00.500 --> 14:02.201
Really?
He said that?

14:02.202 --> 14:04.202
You're not jealous of Leonard, are you?

14:04.203 --> 14:06.337
Me?
No.

14:06.338 --> 14:11.175
I may have mentioned that it's a little
inappropriate to be asking another man's

14:11.176 --> 14:15.212
girlfriend to his experiment without
first discussing it with said man.

14:15.213 --> 14:17.682
Are you saying I need to ask your
permission to hang out with Leonard?

14:17.683 --> 14:19.550
I didn't say anything like that.

14:20.952 --> 14:23.954
I said Leonard has to ask my permission.

14:25.956 --> 14:29.558
Come on, I don't want to eat
lamb stew with my mother.

14:30.613 --> 14:32.596
Damn, I was this <i>close</i> on the bra.

14:35.719 --> 14:39.443
Now, remember, Newton realized
that Aristotle was wrong

14:39.469 --> 14:42.134
and force was not necessary
to maintain motion.

14:42.138 --> 14:47.478
So let's plug in our 9.8 meters
per second squared as "A" and we get

14:47.513 --> 14:52.530
force... Earth gravity, equals mass
times 9.8 meters per second per second.

14:52.534 --> 14:56.950
So we can see that "ma" equals "mg"
and what do we know from this?

15:01.120 --> 15:04.590
Uh, we know that...

15:04.591 --> 15:06.125
...Newton was a really smart cookie.

15:07.663 --> 15:10.730
Oh! Is that where Fig Newtons come from?

15:11.407 --> 15:14.800
No, Fig Newtons are named after
a small town in Massachusetts.

15:15.285 --> 15:18.470
- Well, don't write that down!
- Sorry.

15:18.471 --> 15:22.040
Now, if "ma" equals "mg",
what does that imply?

15:22.041 --> 15:24.775
- I don't know.
- How can you not know?

15:24.776 --> 15:26.378
I just told you.

15:26.379 --> 15:28.848
Have you suffered
a recent blow to the head?

15:28.849 --> 15:31.783
Hey! You don't have to be so mean!

15:31.784 --> 15:33.284
I'm sorry.

15:33.285 --> 15:35.420
Have you suffered
a recent blow to the head?

15:38.257 --> 15:41.163
- No, you just suck at teaching.
- Really?

15:41.198 --> 15:43.560
Of those two explanations, which
one seems the most likely?

15:43.561 --> 15:45.361
Oh, God...

15:45.362 --> 15:49.111
Sheldon, I'm trying to understand,
but you're going too fast.

15:49.146 --> 15:51.501
Can you just back up a little bit?

15:51.536 --> 15:53.336
All right.

15:53.337 --> 15:56.807
It's a warm summer evening
in ancient Greece...

15:56.808 --> 15:58.474
Not that far back!

15:58.475 --> 16:00.042
Okay!

16:00.043 --> 16:02.210
At what point did you begin to feel lost?

16:02.211 --> 16:03.478
I don't know.

16:03.479 --> 16:05.345
Where were we looking up at the night sky?

16:05.346 --> 16:07.618
- Greece.
- Damn it!

16:07.619 --> 16:09.785
There's no need to get frustrated.

16:09.786 --> 16:11.553
People learnt difierent rates.

16:11.554 --> 16:16.391
Unlike objects falling in a vacuum,
which...?

16:18.027 --> 16:21.429
"ma" equals "mg"...?

16:21.731 --> 16:23.966
- Squared?
- No.

16:24.571 --> 16:26.739
- Aristotle?
- No.

16:27.195 --> 16:29.206
- Five?
- Oh!

16:29.237 --> 16:32.673
Then I don't know.

16:33.674 --> 16:37.312
- Why are you crying?
- Because I'm stupid!

16:37.511 --> 16:39.713
That's no reason to cry.

16:40.948 --> 16:43.415
One cries because one is sad.

16:43.416 --> 16:45.817
For example, I cry because
others are stupid

16:45.818 --> 16:47.853
and it makes me sad.

16:49.301 --> 16:51.323
Okay, look, can we just
please forget about

16:51.324 --> 16:55.193
all this extra stuff and can you
just tell me what Leonard does?

16:55.194 --> 16:56.795
All right.

16:56.796 --> 17:02.116
Leonard is attempting to learn why
sub-atomic particles move the way they do.

17:02.415 --> 17:04.633
Really?
That's it?

17:04.634 --> 17:06.469
Well, that doesn't sound so complicated.

17:06.470 --> 17:07.736
It's not.

17:07.737 --> 17:09.838
That's why Leonard does it.

17:12.402 --> 17:14.474
Okay, I just have one question.

17:14.476 --> 17:17.244
What exactly are sub-atomic particles?

17:17.732 --> 17:20.150
- A good question.
- Thank you.

17:20.151 --> 17:22.082
And to answer it, we first must
ask ourselves:

17:22.083 --> 17:25.214
- "What is physics?"
- Oh, balls.

17:25.250 --> 17:28.220
It's a warm summer evening
in ancient Greece...

17:30.008 --> 17:32.256
Okay, I got a bone to pick with you.

17:32.497 --> 17:33.726
What did I do now?

17:33.727 --> 17:37.400
I was in bed with Bernadette,
and you text-blocked me.

17:38.097 --> 17:39.017
What?!

17:39.066 --> 17:42.642
We were completely naked,
about to devour each other when,

17:44.138 --> 17:46.769
you text her that I have a problem
with her hanging out with you.

17:46.770 --> 17:50.105
You do have a problem
with her hanging out with me.

17:50.106 --> 17:52.040
Yeah, but that's not what you tell her.

17:52.041 --> 17:53.643
What was I supposed to tell her?

17:53.644 --> 17:55.777
I don't know; something that
doesn't make me come off

17:55.778 --> 17:58.246
as a petty, jealous douche.

17:58.247 --> 18:01.485
And what would that be?

18:03.320 --> 18:06.655
Come on, do I have to
think of everything?

18:06.656 --> 18:07.824
Hey, Leonard.

18:07.825 --> 18:10.590
Am I too late to see the experiment?

18:10.591 --> 18:12.093
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

18:12.094 --> 18:13.292
What are you doing here?

18:13.293 --> 18:15.261
Same thing you're doing here.

18:15.262 --> 18:17.262
I came to see Leonard's experiment.

18:17.263 --> 18:18.597
No, you didn't.

18:18.598 --> 18:20.299
You said Leonard's experiment was stupid.

18:24.237 --> 18:26.740
You told her my experiment was stupid?

18:26.741 --> 18:29.040
I was just repeating what Sheldon said.

18:30.110 --> 18:32.010
Let's not get off topic.

18:32.011 --> 18:34.444
Bernadette, I need to apologize.

18:34.445 --> 18:38.114
I was wrong to tell you who
you should be friends with.

18:38.115 --> 18:40.483
Should I, um, leave you two alone?

18:40.484 --> 18:41.984
No, Leonard, you should hear this.

18:41.985 --> 18:44.954
Okay, good, 'cause I wasn't
really gonna go.

18:45.642 --> 18:51.127
Look, I know I come off as
confident and worldly, but...

18:52.161 --> 18:54.496
the truth is I'm not.

18:54.497 --> 18:56.497
We're shocked.

18:56.498 --> 19:01.704
Which is why I tend to feel
threatened by other guys.

19:01.705 --> 19:04.939
Or loud noises, clowns and nuns.

19:07.142 --> 19:10.211
But I now realize how foolish that is.

19:10.212 --> 19:11.646
He had a panic attack once

19:11.647 --> 19:13.816
when he got his head stuck in a sweater.

19:14.983 --> 19:17.151
It was a full turtleneck.

19:17.152 --> 19:19.254
Why aren't you helping me?

19:19.255 --> 19:20.822
I don't know.

19:20.823 --> 19:23.758
Maybe because I'm...
crazy?!

19:27.861 --> 19:31.130
Bernadette, please, I'm asking
you to give me another chance.

19:31.131 --> 19:32.831
What do you think, Leonard?

19:32.832 --> 19:34.900
Should I give him another chance?

19:34.901 --> 19:36.069
It's up to you.

19:36.070 --> 19:37.836
He didn't call your experiment stupid.

19:39.839 --> 19:41.206
Come here, tushy face.

19:43.108 --> 19:46.752
"Tushy face. "
That is going on Twitter right now.

19:52.694 --> 19:55.597
Raj, you should've seen
Leonard's experiment.

19:55.598 --> 19:58.834
The interference pattern was so cool
when the electron beam was on.

19:58.835 --> 20:00.300
Glad you enjoyed it.

20:00.301 --> 20:02.271
Most people aren't that
interested in what I do.

20:07.877 --> 20:09.377
Ahem!

20:09.378 --> 20:11.679
Actually, that's not true, Leonard.

20:11.680 --> 20:14.930
In fact, recently I've been thinking that
given the parameters of your experiment,

20:14.965 --> 20:18.316
the transport of electrons through the
aperture of the nano-fabricated metal rings

20:18.317 --> 20:23.422
is qualitatively no different than the
experiment already conducted in the Netherlands.

20:25.292 --> 20:28.999
Their observed phase shift in the
diffusing electrons inside the metal ring

20:29.000 --> 20:31.252
already conclusively demonstrated
the electric analogue

20:31.253 --> 20:34.300
of the Aharonov-Bohm
quantum-interference effect.

20:39.697 --> 20:41.572
That's it.
That's all I know.

20:43.000 --> 20:45.076
Oh, wait...!

20:45.077 --> 20:47.589
Fig Newtons were named
after a town in Massachusetts,

20:47.590 --> 20:49.214
not the scientist.
