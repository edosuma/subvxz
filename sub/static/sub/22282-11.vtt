WEBVTT

00:18.533 --> 00:20.267
SUE AIKENS:
I'm gonna be going to town.

00:20.533 --> 00:23.500
I am making
some major decisions
for the business this year,

00:23.600 --> 00:27.333
and one of those is
I'm going to invest

00:27.500 --> 00:29.533
into getting
a big piece of equipment.

00:30.900 --> 00:33.467
The Bobcat is
my go-to piece of equipment.

00:33.533 --> 00:34.967
But Kavik is now growing,

00:35.133 --> 00:36.467
and the little Bobcat,
much as it tries,

00:36.833 --> 00:38.333
it can't keep up.

00:40.567 --> 00:42.000
I am beating it to death.

00:42.100 --> 00:43.867
I am asking it all of the time

00:44.000 --> 00:46.400
to do a job that
far exceeds its abilities.

00:46.867 --> 00:49.033
The future of Kavik is gonna
greatly depend

00:49.100 --> 00:50.933
on being able to do more,
not less.

00:53.267 --> 00:54.333
Hey, Bob-o.

00:54.500 --> 00:56.100
Hey, Sue.

00:56.167 --> 00:57.600
Thanks for coming out.

00:57.767 --> 01:00.700
SUE: Buying a new
piece of equipment
is a huge venture.

01:00.833 --> 01:04.867
It will either be
one of the slickest,
smartest things I've ever done

01:04.933 --> 01:07.700
to catapult myself
into the next level
of business in life,

01:09.467 --> 01:12.633
or it's gonna be
a huge mistake and
cost me every penny I have.

01:14.700 --> 01:17.200
My entire life is
invested in this camp.

01:17.267 --> 01:19.967
My heart is invested
in its success.

01:31.133 --> 01:33.233
It's time to start a new
chapter at Kavik...

01:34.800 --> 01:36.000
Hopefully.

02:04.867 --> 02:06.700
SUE: I am in town. For camp,

02:06.767 --> 02:08.433
I'm always trying to improve,

02:08.500 --> 02:10.133
always trying to
make things better.

02:10.367 --> 02:12.200
I'm not gonna say
I bought a new toy,

02:12.433 --> 02:14.933
I bartered, traded,
and got some new equipment.

02:22.900 --> 02:24.267
Ta-da!

02:25.033 --> 02:26.033
There she is.

02:31.000 --> 02:32.933
What is it? It's a 966 Cat.

02:33.000 --> 02:35.533
This is
the grownup version of,

02:35.633 --> 02:37.767
(HIGH-PITCHED)
the Bobcat is small...

02:37.833 --> 02:39.467
(REGULAR VOICE)
The Sue-Cat means business.

02:39.700 --> 02:43.167
You know, this is the next
beast for the job, so,

02:44.067 --> 02:45.867
when I say welcome to Kavik,

02:46.200 --> 02:48.333
the beast and I
will be there to meet you.

02:50.467 --> 02:54.200
Ah. Takes me several steps
to get up into here.

02:54.433 --> 02:57.233
It's the natural progression
for where I need to go.

02:57.433 --> 02:59.533
I have to have the
right equipment for the job.

02:59.867 --> 03:03.300
Bucket on the Bobcat's
about that wide. That's

03:03.600 --> 03:06.233
four times, eight times
the Bobcat.

03:06.667 --> 03:09.267
I can go out and
scoop up gravel
and fix things now,

03:09.333 --> 03:13.033
as opposed to, you know,
doing it a teaspoon at a time.

03:13.100 --> 03:14.633
Now I've got a shovel
at a time.

03:14.933 --> 03:16.167
(TOOL WHIRRING)

03:16.300 --> 03:18.233
Fixing the 966

03:18.533 --> 03:20.667
and getting it good to go
on the... On the tundra,

03:20.933 --> 03:22.067
is one small piece.

03:22.200 --> 03:23.833
At the same time that
that's being worked on,

03:24.233 --> 03:25.300
there's a sled.

03:34.300 --> 03:37.800
All of this is one piece
of a very large puzzle.

03:38.333 --> 03:40.067
(SIGHS)

03:40.300 --> 03:43.033
Well, little Betsy,
it's you and me now.

03:43.400 --> 03:45.167
Let me get in here and see
if I can figure it out.

03:49.833 --> 03:51.533
(ENGINE STARTING)

03:59.467 --> 04:00.633
How's it getting home?

04:01.100 --> 04:02.567
There's no roads out to Kavik.

04:02.633 --> 04:04.400
I've got to take this
across the tundra.

04:04.633 --> 04:06.433
(WHOOPS)

04:09.933 --> 04:11.433
(BRAKES SCREECHING)

04:13.267 --> 04:14.667
I am a bit nervous
about the trip.

04:14.733 --> 04:16.967
It's a big journey,
and you got to ask yourself,

04:17.033 --> 04:19.200
why the hell would a
50-something-year-old woman

04:19.267 --> 04:21.067
decide, "Oh, that's the way
to go home"?

04:21.267 --> 04:22.300
Because I have to.

04:22.367 --> 04:23.467
Be safe, have fun
with your new toy.

04:23.533 --> 04:25.933
I will do that.
Thank you so much.

04:26.167 --> 04:27.867
I'm always trying
to improve Kavik.

04:27.933 --> 04:29.667
To keep my lease,
I got to keep working at it.

04:29.800 --> 04:32.833
There's no sit down,
take it easy, and hope
it works out okay.

04:32.900 --> 04:34.767
I have to make it
work out okay.

04:34.900 --> 04:37.000
This is gonna get
the job done, so,

04:37.333 --> 04:39.667
little lady we're onto
the next chapter in Kavik.

04:44.133 --> 04:46.500
CHIP HAILSTONE: The fact is
success is really opportunity

04:46.600 --> 04:47.700
meeting preparedness,

04:47.767 --> 04:49.700
so what we do is
we prepare ourselves.

05:00.267 --> 05:02.200
Looks like springtime's
heading our way soon.

05:02.333 --> 05:06.133
Soon this will all change.
All this water will flow,
the ocean'll open up.

05:08.033 --> 05:10.200
It'll green up, the fish will
come in, the birds.

05:10.267 --> 05:12.200
But for now,
it's light winter.

05:17.100 --> 05:18.667
The thing to do today
is go look for an ox.

05:19.000 --> 05:20.733
So today, me and Agnes
are leaving Kiwalik.

05:20.900 --> 05:22.733
We're gonna go
over the mountains
and up on the ridge tops,

05:22.833 --> 05:25.100
here, until we spot
a herd of ox.

05:25.900 --> 05:27.267
Well, you know,
getting to hunt muskox

05:27.400 --> 05:29.033
isn't something
everybody gets to do.
You have to win a draw.

05:29.367 --> 05:31.800
And the draw is based on how
many years you've hunted ox,

05:31.867 --> 05:33.233
how many years
you would've hunted ox,

05:33.333 --> 05:35.100
and how many times
you've been successful.

05:35.267 --> 05:36.800
So I've been
successful at this

05:37.133 --> 05:38.533
plenty of times.

05:38.600 --> 05:41.433
Enough to where
I was able to qualify
and obtain a tag.

05:41.800 --> 05:42.933
So I'm pretty happy with that.

05:44.000 --> 05:48.100
I spent three years
on felony probation for a
nonviolent crime of perjury.

05:48.533 --> 05:50.433
I wasn't allowed to use any
type of firearm whatsoever,

05:50.500 --> 05:54.933
so I used a bow and an arrow,
and I used a lance.
And I did my best.

05:55.000 --> 05:57.467
I sat back and I watched
my wife take over the hunting.

06:02.333 --> 06:04.767
This here is a
.50 calibre Hawken-type rifle,

06:05.333 --> 06:06.833
and this is legal.
This is black powder.

06:07.133 --> 06:08.733
This is what I can
use right now,

06:09.367 --> 06:11.400
and if it's what I got to use,
then I'm gonna learn it.

06:11.467 --> 06:12.500
I'm gonna use it well,

06:12.667 --> 06:14.333
till I can get back to
a cartridge gun.

06:15.467 --> 06:18.167
Basically what it is,
is that I'm not allowed
to have cartridges

06:18.233 --> 06:20.467
or use what they consider
a modern firearm,

06:20.700 --> 06:23.733
which would be
a firearm manufactured
after the year of 1898.

06:23.800 --> 06:25.333
-(RIFLE CLICKS)
-Oh, didn't go off.

06:25.467 --> 06:26.767
AGNES: Aw, man.

06:26.900 --> 06:28.900
CHIP: At these temperatures,
the grease just congeals.

06:29.000 --> 06:30.167
Put another cap on.

06:32.400 --> 06:33.767
-Aim again.
-(RIFLE CLICKS)

06:33.833 --> 06:34.900
-AGNES: Ah!
-Nothing.

06:35.533 --> 06:37.000
Add a few grains
of powder in there.

06:37.433 --> 06:39.733
AGNES:
Okay, let's try that again.

06:40.067 --> 06:41.400
-(GUN CLICKS)
-AGNES: Ah!

06:43.867 --> 06:45.200
CHIP:
It's why I got the 12-gauge.

06:47.367 --> 06:49.133
This here is the backup.

06:50.333 --> 06:51.867
Whoo!

06:51.933 --> 06:53.167
(LAUGHS)

06:53.267 --> 06:54.500
The shotgun's a smoothbore.

06:54.600 --> 06:56.000
But this .50 calibre rifle

06:56.067 --> 06:57.833
throws the bullets
much more accurately,

06:57.933 --> 06:59.833
so the whole deal
with this 12-gauge is

06:59.900 --> 07:01.567
that I have to
be a lot closer.

07:05.467 --> 07:08.267
-Well, let's go
get our ox.
-(AGNES CHEERS)

07:10.900 --> 07:12.567
NARRATOR: To intercept muskox,

07:12.767 --> 07:14.833
the Hailstones must travel
into the mountains

07:14.900 --> 07:17.133
west of their hunting grounds
in Kiwalik.

07:19.400 --> 07:22.033
With their shotgun
as their only working firearm,

07:22.400 --> 07:26.033
success will rely
on locating a herd
within a short-range distance.

07:28.467 --> 07:30.733
CHIP: You know, a muskox
isn't a huge animal.

07:30.867 --> 07:33.100
They're actually rather small
when you see 'em.
It's kind of amazing.

07:33.300 --> 07:34.667
-(MUSK OX GROANS)
-But yet,

07:34.767 --> 07:36.800
they're probably
twice the amount of meat
as a caribou.

07:36.900 --> 07:38.567
(MUSK OX GROANS)

07:42.700 --> 07:44.733
(AGNES TALKING)

07:47.533 --> 07:51.500
CHIP: Oh, I see something
over there, probably maybe
a herd of caribou.

07:51.567 --> 07:53.033
There's something over there.

07:55.900 --> 07:57.600
Oh, I think those
are muskox, Agnes.

07:57.667 --> 07:59.133
Here, tell me what you think.

08:01.300 --> 08:02.900
AGNES: I believe you're right.

08:04.067 --> 08:05.367
Like a herd of 'em.

08:05.467 --> 08:06.967
The deal is
if they were down here

08:07.100 --> 08:08.700
where I could
sneak up close to 'em

08:08.767 --> 08:09.900
that wouldn't be a problem,

08:09.967 --> 08:11.667
but right now
it's as open as where we are.

08:12.467 --> 08:14.100
AGNES: Yeah.
CHIP: And the only way

08:14.167 --> 08:16.867
I'm gonna get
at one of them things is
to have that rifle working.

08:17.400 --> 08:20.000
If I don't have
the rifle working, I'm gonna
have to use the shotgun.

08:20.133 --> 08:21.633
I don't think I'm gonna
get up that close.

08:23.867 --> 08:25.767
So basically,
we've come over this far,

08:25.933 --> 08:29.400
we know that there's
muskox in the area,
and we finally located some.

08:29.467 --> 08:30.733
And we're
pretty happy with 'em.

08:30.800 --> 08:32.367
There's a lot of 'em,
they're looking good,

08:32.533 --> 08:35.167
the problem is I don't
have the range with
the shotgun that I brought,

08:35.233 --> 08:36.767
so I got to get
the Hawkens to work.

08:37.933 --> 08:40.267
The only way I can see
getting the Hawkens to work
and quickly,

08:40.333 --> 08:41.567
is probably drive to Deering,

08:41.667 --> 08:43.333
go to my friend Jerry,
who's an elder,

08:43.633 --> 08:45.233
and then hopefully
repair the Hawken,

08:45.333 --> 08:46.967
come back, and work
on those ox over there.

08:48.100 --> 08:49.900
AGNES: We know
where the muskox are,

08:49.967 --> 08:50.967
and they're not gonna go far.

08:51.367 --> 08:52.767
They'll probably be

08:52.900 --> 08:54.667
in the same area
when we start heading
back towards them.

08:54.800 --> 08:56.433
You know, once
you got the ox in sight,

08:57.000 --> 08:59.133
all you need's a working gun.

09:03.033 --> 09:05.033
GLENN VILLENEUVE: You got
to take care of it yourself
out here.

09:05.567 --> 09:07.833
That takes knowledge,
it takes experience.

09:08.033 --> 09:10.567
If you don't know
what you're doing,
you don't belong out here.

09:31.300 --> 09:32.600
Today, I'm gonna

09:32.867 --> 09:35.333
head to the east
to another camp I have set up.

09:38.167 --> 09:40.567
Down in the valley,
I have a small wall tent
that I set up.

09:40.733 --> 09:42.367
It extends my hunting range.

09:44.433 --> 09:47.100
It's a place where I can stay
further away from home.

09:48.833 --> 09:52.867
But there's been
a big snowfall since the
last time I was down there.

09:55.933 --> 09:58.733
Hopefully my tent's okay.
It snowed a lot.

09:58.933 --> 10:00.733
It's probably snowed a foot
since I've been down there.

10:00.833 --> 10:02.433
That tent could
have collapsed.

10:02.500 --> 10:04.367
But I'm gonna go down there,
take care of things.

10:08.433 --> 10:10.400
The snow's more than knee-deep
now in the woods.

10:11.500 --> 10:13.667
It's difficult to get around
without a packed trail.

10:14.333 --> 10:16.233
Makes walking real difficult.

10:16.433 --> 10:18.300
That's why
I got to use my snowshoes,

10:18.500 --> 10:19.933
pack down the trail.

10:25.700 --> 10:28.333
Travelling in fresh snow is
difficult and time-consuming.

10:32.767 --> 10:34.467
But when I have
a broken trail,

10:34.533 --> 10:36.667
I can travel up and down it
quickly and efficiently.

10:37.400 --> 10:39.400
Once I have a trail,
I use it over
and over and over.

10:39.467 --> 10:41.000
It's the highway
in the wilderness.

10:43.967 --> 10:47.033
Hey, look. There's the sun!
The sun's coming up.

10:48.167 --> 10:51.333
That's the first time
the sun has come up
down here in the valley

10:51.433 --> 10:53.033
for more than three months.

11:00.367 --> 11:01.467
Amazing.

11:01.567 --> 11:04.033
The sun's right to
the south, now.

11:04.100 --> 11:06.267
It's midday, and it's just
rising above the horizon.

11:06.667 --> 11:08.433
It'll just be up
for a little while today,

11:08.500 --> 11:10.433
but each day
the sun'll come up for longer.

11:11.433 --> 11:13.767
What a beautiful time of year
when the sun comes back.

11:13.967 --> 11:16.367
Moving out of dark winter
and moving towards
light winter.

11:21.567 --> 11:22.733
Hey, there it is!

11:26.667 --> 11:29.533
Oh, wow. It looks like
it might have broken
or something.

11:30.767 --> 11:32.200
So much snow on it.

11:33.400 --> 11:34.933
It's partly fallen down.

11:36.600 --> 11:38.733
I haven't been down here
since the last big snowfall.

11:39.000 --> 11:40.400
My woodpile's all buried.

11:40.467 --> 11:41.967
It looks like there's
over a foot of new snow.

11:42.267 --> 11:44.000
Tent's partly collapsed.

11:44.133 --> 11:46.100
I got to dig this out
and get it set back up.

11:47.500 --> 11:49.233
Since I was here last,
it snowed a lot.

11:51.367 --> 11:52.767
It collapsed the tent,

11:54.233 --> 11:55.467
snowed in my trail.

11:55.533 --> 11:57.200
I had to get back down here
to clean this out

11:57.367 --> 12:00.300
and salvage this.
If I left this
without cleaning it off,

12:00.400 --> 12:02.833
eventually, it would
just be destroyed.

12:06.800 --> 12:08.533
This is a really
nice little camp.

12:09.800 --> 12:11.533
A nice place for me
to stay down here.

12:11.667 --> 12:13.933
I can get out further.
With this camp here,

12:14.000 --> 12:16.433
I can hunt further away
from my main camp.

12:16.900 --> 12:18.800
-(WOLF HOWLING)
-I got a place to
spend the night,

12:19.100 --> 12:20.467
place to get warm,

12:21.367 --> 12:22.767
place to get shelter.

12:24.067 --> 12:25.633
I just hope nothing got torn.

12:28.533 --> 12:31.000
Oh, look, it's okay!

12:31.700 --> 12:33.300
I'm gonna be able
to set it back up.

12:34.200 --> 12:36.733
Okay, I got to go outside
and tie the corners back up.

12:38.300 --> 12:40.067
I'm really glad I got
my trail broken out,

12:40.200 --> 12:42.767
and I got down here
before the next snowfall,
because this tent

12:43.067 --> 12:44.867
had about as much snow on it
as it could take.

12:44.933 --> 12:46.733
If it had snowed again
before I got to it,

12:46.933 --> 12:48.700
it probably would
have cracked the ridgepole.

12:48.867 --> 12:50.600
This is an important camp
to me,

12:50.667 --> 12:52.633
and I'm glad I got
down here and saved it
before the snow destroyed it.

12:55.633 --> 12:58.367
The tent's set back up.
Nothing damaged.
I'm gonna head home.

12:58.433 --> 13:00.133
It's cold out.

13:00.200 --> 13:02.100
I got to get back to camp.

13:06.400 --> 13:08.167
ANDY BASSICH: There's no
9:00 to 5:00 jobs out here.

13:08.900 --> 13:10.133
If you want to
live out in the bush,

13:10.200 --> 13:12.500
you got to be self-motivated
and self-employed.

13:29.067 --> 13:32.033
Tomorrow's the end of
the trapping season for me,
so I'm gonna

13:32.233 --> 13:33.633
close down some traps,

13:33.700 --> 13:36.667
make sure that
I get everything
closed down in time.

13:37.967 --> 13:40.033
Time to get going.
Burning daylight.

13:45.033 --> 13:47.033
It's time to
pull all the traps.

13:47.133 --> 13:49.833
I like to collect up all
my traps and all my snares,

13:49.900 --> 13:52.067
and then I can
reset in new places.

13:54.100 --> 13:55.500
I'm not a big-time trapper.

13:55.767 --> 13:57.700
I do it because I'm out
running my dogs,

13:58.000 --> 14:01.300
and if I'm out running
my dogs, I might as well
set a little bit of steel out

14:01.367 --> 14:02.700
and try and
pick up a few animals,

14:02.767 --> 14:04.700
and that helps
pay for my dog food.

14:05.100 --> 14:07.867
It helps pay for gasoline
for the snow machine.

14:09.100 --> 14:10.600
No, nothing in here.

14:16.967 --> 14:19.033
I still got quite a few miles
to get home from here.

14:19.133 --> 14:20.967
I got to keep on moving.

14:23.833 --> 14:26.333
I got, I think one
or two more lynx sets.

14:26.533 --> 14:28.000
I wanna pull all the steel

14:28.133 --> 14:30.500
so it doesn't get washed
away in overflow,

14:30.567 --> 14:31.967
or lost in the summertime.

14:37.200 --> 14:38.533
Last trap of the day.

14:39.000 --> 14:40.333
(SIGHS)

14:40.400 --> 14:42.067
(GASPS) Holy shit.

14:43.000 --> 14:44.000
Yee-haw.

14:44.133 --> 14:45.167
Look at you.

14:45.333 --> 14:47.200
Look like you must've
climbed that tree, huh?

14:47.267 --> 14:48.500
You're all tangled up.

14:48.567 --> 14:50.300
I better go get
my snare, then.

14:50.867 --> 14:52.700
It's totally unexpected.

14:52.767 --> 14:55.900
I was hoping to catch a couple
wolverines this year,
that didn't happen.

14:56.133 --> 14:57.700
Actually, this is
the first lynx.

14:58.200 --> 15:00.733
And I guess it'll be
the last lynx of the year too.

15:02.733 --> 15:04.467
Starting to run
out of daylight now,

15:04.667 --> 15:08.500
so I'd like to just
get this taken care of,
and get on home.

15:09.133 --> 15:10.400
It's not just the fur.

15:11.033 --> 15:12.567
It's the bones and
the claws and everything

15:12.967 --> 15:15.200
I'll be able to utilise too,
so it'll be

15:15.400 --> 15:17.233
absolutely nothing going
to waste on this lynx.

15:17.667 --> 15:20.033
Boy, that's a beautiful fur.

15:20.233 --> 15:22.967
Nice and light. What you
want on lynx is you want

15:23.100 --> 15:25.433
really nice belly fur
and a nice grey back.

15:25.600 --> 15:27.100
That's a nice lynx.

15:28.800 --> 15:30.400
It's a lot of work, trapping.

15:30.633 --> 15:33.233
To do it right, you should
be checking your traps
every three or four days.

15:34.233 --> 15:35.667
So it's very time-consuming.

15:39.633 --> 15:41.267
It's a lot
of harsh conditions.

15:42.167 --> 15:43.767
And, this is the payoff.

15:43.900 --> 15:46.767
You know, every now and then
you get just a really
beautiful animal,

15:47.000 --> 15:48.167
and this is gonna be food.

15:48.400 --> 15:50.633
This is gonna be
a really nice fur hat.

15:51.100 --> 15:53.167
This is a good end
to my trapping season,

15:53.333 --> 15:55.367
and a good beginning
for springtime.

15:57.567 --> 15:58.900
This was a good day.

16:03.567 --> 16:04.600
CHIP: It's hunting.

16:04.667 --> 16:06.133
It's not shopping in a store,

16:06.300 --> 16:08.667
so we're flexible.
If you're not flexible,
you don't survive.

AGNES: Hey, Jerry.

16:24.833 --> 16:26.333
CHIP: Hey, Jerry.

16:26.400 --> 16:27.767
AGNES: Good to see you again.

16:29.733 --> 16:32.033
NARRATOR: Chip and Agnes
spotted a herd of muskox,

16:32.300 --> 16:36.300
but were unable to get
close enough for a good shot
with their long-range rifle.

16:36.533 --> 16:38.167
-(RIFLE CLICKS)
-AGNES: Ah.

16:38.233 --> 16:41.500
NARRATOR: Fixing the
antique black powder gun
for the hunt is crucial,

16:41.800 --> 16:44.300
and to do so they must travel
to Deering

16:44.367 --> 16:46.200
and seek the help
of a village elder.

16:46.800 --> 16:48.433
CHIP: I need the tools
that Jerry's got.

16:48.733 --> 16:50.433
He's got all kinds of
really small tools,

16:50.500 --> 16:53.533
and he's got the things
I would probably need
to make this gun work again.

16:53.600 --> 16:54.833
There's no cartridges.

16:55.033 --> 16:56.900
It's a black powder
Hawkens .50 cal.

16:58.600 --> 17:01.133
And I tried repeatedly
to get this thing to go off.

17:01.233 --> 17:02.900
I took it all apart,
I cleaned it as best I could,

17:02.967 --> 17:04.200
I still couldn't
get it to go off.

17:04.767 --> 17:06.200
JERRY:
This is a counterweight?

17:06.500 --> 17:09.000
The bullet is soft lead,
and it's on top
of black powder,

17:09.067 --> 17:11.200
and it's down here,
and the black powder
won't go off.

17:11.333 --> 17:14.033
I was thinking probably
best thing to do would be
brush the bore really good,

17:14.100 --> 17:15.300
lube it up,
maybe take it apart,

17:15.367 --> 17:17.367
take the lock off
and take the barrel off.

17:17.867 --> 17:21.667
Where the ox are,
and where they tend to stay,
is where it's really clear.

17:21.767 --> 17:24.367
And where I got to go
to 'em, I'm gonna have to
sneak up pretty good.

17:24.433 --> 17:27.100
By the time they would
run away, I could probably be
100 yards away.

17:28.033 --> 17:30.333
I can't close that range
with the shotgun,

17:30.933 --> 17:32.867
so I need something
with a nice big bullet,

17:32.933 --> 17:34.133
nice big rifle.

17:35.500 --> 17:36.833
And this is the gun
for that trick.

17:36.900 --> 17:38.333
I got to make this rifle work,

17:38.400 --> 17:39.867
either that or else they have
to be down by the river

17:39.933 --> 17:41.400
where I can
put the sneak on 'em.

17:43.933 --> 17:45.467
There we go.

17:46.933 --> 17:48.500
All right, man,
I think this will do it.

17:54.300 --> 17:56.300
(DOGS BARKING)

17:57.533 --> 17:59.733
I'm gonna go down here
a ways towards this cliff.

18:00.000 --> 18:02.100
I'm gonna go give
this thing a test shot.

18:02.633 --> 18:04.933
So what I've done is
I've cleaned out the vent

18:05.167 --> 18:07.633
as best I could,
and the drum as best I could.

18:07.733 --> 18:10.000
And I went along and I added
new fresh powder to it,

18:10.067 --> 18:11.700
and I put it all
back together.

18:11.767 --> 18:13.400
Hopefully I've got something
that will come
right out of here.

18:14.300 --> 18:15.833
I think this should be good.

18:19.500 --> 18:21.000
There it goes.

18:22.300 --> 18:23.400
That's what we want to see.

18:24.933 --> 18:27.500
Now, I'm happy.
This baby is ready to go.

this country, there is
no room for forgiveness.

18:38.033 --> 18:39.767
You make a mistake,
it could be fatal.

18:52.333 --> 18:55.733
This is the last thing
for me to do, really.

18:56.133 --> 18:57.700
Oh.

18:58.100 --> 19:00.267
It's the final hook-up
to getting the sled on there.

19:00.533 --> 19:02.833
Trailer's on, rig is running.

19:02.933 --> 19:04.667

I got to go.

19:05.167 --> 19:08.200
I've got 86-and-a-half
land miles, 60 by air.

19:08.333 --> 19:10.333
But I'm not flying,
I'm driving.

19:14.867 --> 19:17.467
(METAL SCRAPING)

19:18.133 --> 19:20.100
The plan is,
get it up to the haul road,

19:20.200 --> 19:22.167
then I got to turn right,
hold onto my butt,

19:22.267 --> 19:23.700
and hope I make it home okay.

19:23.767 --> 19:25.500
I got to have a big
piece of equipment.

19:25.567 --> 19:28.533
This is not, "Suzy just wants
to have something
cute in the driveway."

This is,
"Suzy has to get it done."

NARRATOR: For Sue,
returning to Kavik
from Deadhorse

19:39.033 --> 19:42.133
is an 86-mile trek
across rugged tundra.

19:43.867 --> 19:47.100
On the journey,
she must cross three rivers
and deep snow.

19:48.200 --> 19:50.267
Doing so in
an unfamiliar vehicle

19:50.367 --> 19:53.300
and in volatile weather is
a dangerous undertaking.

19:57.300 --> 20:00.667
SUE: The challenge is
gonna be little ignorant Suzy
behind the wheel,

20:00.733 --> 20:03.033
going 86-and-a-half miles
across the tundra home.

20:04.367 --> 20:06.867
You know, weevils wobble,
and hopefully
I won't fall down.

20:07.467 --> 20:08.667
I'm a little nervous about it.

20:08.733 --> 20:10.433
It's a whole lot
of power and I'm...

20:10.500 --> 20:13.300
I'm... It's like setting me up
on Secretariat and saying,

20:13.467 --> 20:14.900
"Win the Triple Crown, Sue."

20:15.833 --> 20:16.967
I've got to do it.

20:17.033 --> 20:18.100
Do I know how to do it? No.

20:18.233 --> 20:20.533
Will I learn?

20:29.000 --> 20:30.467
(GROANS)

20:38.133 --> 20:40.033
All's I'm doing
is spinning tyres.

20:40.700 --> 20:42.367
Really? Fucking really?

20:44.500 --> 20:45.967
I'm stuck!

20:47.100 --> 20:49.133
We're done.

20:49.200 --> 20:52.167
This is
the Sagavanirktok River.

20:52.667 --> 20:55.200
I'm right where the bank
meets the river,

20:55.433 --> 20:57.967
sitting on, half on ice,
half not on ice.

20:58.500 --> 21:01.400
Um, this amount of snow
should not be a problem.

21:01.467 --> 21:03.833
My tyres should of dug down,
found the dirt, and gone.

21:04.133 --> 21:05.900
They found ice
and they're spinning.

21:05.967 --> 21:08.567
So my chains are
tits-up fucking worthless.

21:13.600 --> 21:15.933
Yeah. All's I'm doing
is spinning tyres.

21:18.433 --> 21:19.867
Of course it's frustrating.

21:19.933 --> 21:22.767
I should not get stuck in this
little of an amount of snow.

21:22.967 --> 21:25.967
I'm gonna have a hell of
a lot deeper snow out there
than this.

21:26.167 --> 21:29.267
So if this is how
it's gonna act,
it won't make the journey.

21:29.533 --> 21:31.667
I'm gonna reach
20-foot drifts,

21:32.033 --> 21:33.667
and have to dig myself out.

21:33.733 --> 21:36.700
And if I can't do that then...
Then there's
a fucking problem.

21:39.633 --> 21:43.133
Next plan of action
for me is to try to
get a hold of somebody

21:43.233 --> 21:45.200
to try and get me
on the right track.

It's possible I'm biting off
more than I can chew.

21:55.300 --> 21:57.400
I mean, I may have
to make an executive decision

21:57.467 --> 21:58.833
to stop before I start.

22:00.567 --> 22:03.433
Was it too much to ask that
one fucking thing go right?

I'm not usually defeatist,

the machine's ass right now.

I still got to get it out,
so we'll see.

this lynx here.

22:45.100 --> 22:46.533
Think it's thawed out enough,

so get it started here,
see what I come up with.

22:49.767 --> 22:51.233
(BARKING)

22:55.933 --> 22:58.800
All right, well, time to try
and take care of this lynx.

22:58.867 --> 23:02.067
It feels like it's somewhat
thawed out. It's still
a little bit frozen,

23:02.167 --> 23:04.500
but see if I can't get him
skinned out here.

23:09.267 --> 23:11.433
Was definitely excited
to catch this.

23:11.533 --> 23:13.733
Lynx like this is worth
a fair amount of money.

23:13.800 --> 23:16.900
I think the real value
in this lynx is that
it's in such good shape

23:17.000 --> 23:19.667
that it potentially
could be taxidermied.

23:19.933 --> 23:22.000
The way I look at it,
if you're gonna kill
something like this,

23:22.133 --> 23:24.167
there's a certain
amount of respect

23:24.467 --> 23:26.800
that is owed
the animal too, you know?

23:27.033 --> 23:29.267
As far as how you treat it

23:29.333 --> 23:31.533
and what you do with it
and all that, so,

23:31.867 --> 23:33.867
maximising the value of it

23:34.033 --> 23:36.900
is another way of kind of
showing a little bit
of respect for the animal.

23:37.233 --> 23:40.733
I got to be real careful
down here where
he was caught,

23:40.800 --> 23:42.267
his trap was right across
his foot here,

23:42.333 --> 23:45.033
so I'm gonna have to be
really careful right in there.

23:46.733 --> 23:50.300
Or I think
I might just take it off
at this joint here.

23:53.367 --> 23:55.033
It does cost money
to buy fuel.

23:55.100 --> 23:56.933
It does cost money
to buy dog food.

23:57.000 --> 23:59.600
So, you know, a lynx like
this contributing to

23:59.667 --> 24:03.167
that cause just makes
life sustainable out here.

24:03.800 --> 24:07.333
That's what I like to do.
I like to use the resources
out here, to uh,

24:07.400 --> 24:08.400
take care of my needs.

24:08.467 --> 24:10.067
This lynx is one of
those things

24:10.200 --> 24:12.733
that's gonna help take care
of my monetary needs.

24:15.433 --> 24:18.667
My guess is the going price
for this fur to a taxidermist,

24:18.733 --> 24:20.167
probably 300, maybe.

24:20.233 --> 24:22.267
It's a quarter of a year
in dog food.

24:25.000 --> 24:26.767
A nice little shoulder roast.

24:28.533 --> 24:30.533
Whenever I eat lynx,
it's mainly just the tubes.

24:30.600 --> 24:31.600
That's the legs.

24:33.700 --> 24:35.867
Got the trapline
all closed down now.

24:36.000 --> 24:37.333
Got a nice piece of fur.

24:38.033 --> 24:39.333
Got some good food.

24:40.033 --> 24:41.033
And a good experience.

24:45.033 --> 24:47.967
GLENN: It's a very
physically demanding lifestyle
I live out here,

24:48.133 --> 24:50.433
and I'm always pushing myself
pretty hard.

25:07.300 --> 25:08.433
I made it to the tent.

25:08.500 --> 25:10.200
There was a lot of snow on it.

25:10.600 --> 25:13.100
But luckily,
nothing was damaged.

25:13.867 --> 25:15.233
It's a long, long trip

25:15.300 --> 25:17.267
to go all the way down there
and back the same day,

25:17.333 --> 25:19.100
especially breaking trail
through fresh snow.

25:26.533 --> 25:30.100
Having a real problem
with my leg.

25:30.167 --> 25:31.933
Not feeling too good right
down here on my shin.

25:33.067 --> 25:35.267
Trying to get all the way back
to camp tonight.

25:36.200 --> 25:37.633
I probably should have just
stayed in the tent.

25:37.933 --> 25:39.567
It's a lot of walking
on snowshoes.

25:42.600 --> 25:44.433
Breaking trail
through fresh snow,

25:44.500 --> 25:47.233
it puts a lot of stress on
those particular muscles

25:47.300 --> 25:49.233
and tendons
in that part of the body.

25:49.967 --> 25:52.867
Because every time
you lift up that snowshoe,

25:52.933 --> 25:54.467
you're lifting up
all that weight.

25:58.733 --> 26:00.800
All the weight is right there
on my toe,

26:00.933 --> 26:03.200
and it's putting a lot of
stress right in here,

26:03.267 --> 26:06.700
but I'm more than
halfway back now.
I'm gonna keep going.

26:08.700 --> 26:12.200
Just gonna try walking on
one snowshoe for a ways,
see if that works.

26:14.400 --> 26:16.800
Out here, my two legs
are my transportation.

26:17.700 --> 26:19.567
One thing I do
have to be able to do

26:19.700 --> 26:21.900
is get back home to camp
every night,

26:22.000 --> 26:23.767
get to some place
where I have shelter.

26:24.667 --> 26:26.767
Oh!

26:29.900 --> 26:31.567
Long walk on a cold day.

26:44.000 --> 26:45.833
One thing I've learned
about injuries

26:45.967 --> 26:47.300
is listen to your body.

26:47.433 --> 26:50.267
If your body's hurting, it's
trying to tell you something.

26:50.333 --> 26:51.867
In this case right here,

26:52.033 --> 26:54.200
this leg's trying to
tell me not to use it.

26:54.300 --> 26:55.467
I just got to take it easy,

26:55.533 --> 26:57.033
take it one step at a time.

26:57.100 --> 26:59.367
Eventually I'll get back,
even if I get back slowly.

27:15.500 --> 27:16.933
Made it back.

27:17.033 --> 27:18.300
Feels good to be home.

27:19.800 --> 27:22.833
I just want to get inside,
take my clothes off,
get some rest.

27:27.600 --> 27:30.733
Hurts even just
taking my boot off and on.

27:30.800 --> 27:32.600
If you can't walk
on snowshoes, you basically

27:32.867 --> 27:34.467
can't walk out here
at this time of year,

27:34.633 --> 27:35.667
you can't get around.

27:35.800 --> 27:36.800
Oh.

27:37.300 --> 27:39.567
Oh, yeah, it's definitely
swollen right in this area.

27:41.567 --> 27:43.233
I think I'm having a problem
with the tendons.

27:43.300 --> 27:45.500
That they became inflamed
because of overuse.

27:45.667 --> 27:47.000
I was snowshoeing so much,

27:47.067 --> 27:48.867
so I'm gonna try
heat and cold.

27:49.000 --> 27:50.733
I don't get injured
very often.

27:50.800 --> 27:53.400
But when I have a problem
like this, I have to
take care of it myself.

27:57.433 --> 27:59.367
I can't make a trip
to the doctor's office,

27:59.467 --> 28:01.100
'cause it's 200 miles
down to Fairbanks.

28:01.167 --> 28:03.100
Costs a few thousand
dollars to go there.

28:03.467 --> 28:05.100
(BIRD CHITTERING)

28:06.833 --> 28:08.300
(GLENN SIGHS)

28:11.800 --> 28:14.300
Just give it time,
and have patience.

28:14.367 --> 28:17.033
Your body will
heal itself eventually
of most things

28:17.100 --> 28:19.233
that happen to you.
That's all I can do
is just wait,

28:19.300 --> 28:21.700
treat it as best I can
and see what happens.

28:25.033 --> 28:26.800
ANDY: I love living
a lifestyle where

28:26.867 --> 28:29.100
everything that I need to live
is out here.

28:29.167 --> 28:30.500
I just have to either kill it,

28:30.600 --> 28:33.300
fish it, or grow it.

28:42.867 --> 28:45.167
Couple nice, big hunks a meat.

28:46.933 --> 28:49.567
It's been a lot of work
the last couple weeks,

28:49.733 --> 28:52.700
and there's
a ton of work coming
because it's springtime.

28:52.933 --> 28:55.000
Springtime means
lots of projects.

28:55.233 --> 28:56.733
The plate is full.

28:56.800 --> 28:59.267
And uh, I guess I'll

28:59.367 --> 29:00.900
fill it up with some
lynx meat tonight.

29:09.067 --> 29:10.233
Yum-yum.

29:10.300 --> 29:12.367
Got some barbequed lynx.

29:12.533 --> 29:14.433
Let's see if it's
all cooked up all right.

29:16.367 --> 29:17.533
Look at that.

29:21.867 --> 29:23.667
Mmm-mmm.

29:24.900 --> 29:26.733
Yeah, that's pretty good.

29:26.967 --> 29:29.933
This is a little bit different
addition to my diet.

29:30.000 --> 29:31.433
I eat a lot of moose,

29:31.967 --> 29:33.300
a lot of black bear,

29:34.267 --> 29:35.533
a lot of salmon.

29:38.667 --> 29:40.500
Don't eat a lot of lynx,
but it's...

29:41.167 --> 29:42.400
It's good meat.

29:43.167 --> 29:44.467
Chow down.

29:50.733 --> 29:54.167
SUE: Like any skill set
in any walk of life,

29:54.233 --> 29:55.767
you learn it as you go.

30:05.367 --> 30:09.367
Oh, there he is.
He's coming in. Nice.

30:09.433 --> 30:13.233
NARRATOR: Not long into
the journey from Deadhorse
to Kavik in her new loader,

30:13.333 --> 30:16.467
the vehicle got trapped in
a patch of deep ice and snow.

30:17.900 --> 30:20.500
Unable to drive the loader
back onto solid ground,

30:22.767 --> 30:25.067
Sue was forced to
call for an emergency tow.

30:26.233 --> 30:28.133
This is called a Steiger.

30:28.433 --> 30:30.100
I'm on big tyres,

30:30.400 --> 30:31.667
he's got tracks.

30:31.733 --> 30:34.133
And he's got maybe
a little more manoeuvrability.

30:34.600 --> 30:36.267
Damn it,
now I want one of those.

30:37.867 --> 30:39.200
It's starting to get
a little darker,

30:39.267 --> 30:42.333
so now what I'm doing is I'm
gonna separate the trailer,

30:42.467 --> 30:43.933
yank it off,

30:44.233 --> 30:46.533
get me out of here,
yank me up.

30:46.767 --> 30:49.600
I need to regroup and see
how I want to handle this.

30:49.800 --> 30:52.233
One false move,
I'm back to square one.

30:54.633 --> 30:57.933
If you ever want to make
yourself feel pretty small,

30:58.700 --> 31:02.533
try being the big girl
wearing big girl panties
on the tundra

31:02.600 --> 31:05.733
and always having to be,
you know, having to be
rescued by the boys.

31:09.633 --> 31:11.233
So now, he's gonna back up,

31:11.333 --> 31:13.000
hook it to my clevis pin.

31:13.167 --> 31:15.267
I've got to get in,
throw it in neutral,

31:15.700 --> 31:17.567
and he's gonna try
and yank me out.

31:17.633 --> 31:18.633
Okay.

31:23.567 --> 31:24.800
Come on.

31:25.400 --> 31:27.033
Come on, you fucking whore.

31:44.867 --> 31:46.933

That was stuck pretty good.

31:47.067 --> 31:48.600
(SUE LAUGHS)

32:00.600 --> 32:03.867
Today, I tried to get
across the Sag River
and start on my journey,

32:03.933 --> 32:05.133
epic fail.

32:05.200 --> 32:07.133
But I got out, I'm regrouping,

32:07.233 --> 32:08.733
time for me to just chill

32:08.833 --> 32:11.533
and think about how
I want to attack it.

32:11.600 --> 32:14.233
This does not mean that
I am gonna fail overall,

32:14.467 --> 32:16.100
I just failed
at my first attempt.

32:17.100 --> 32:20.433
It is now officially
a challenge and that's
what I live for, so,

32:20.900 --> 32:22.900
if it takes me all winter
I'm getting it out there.

32:23.033 --> 32:24.500
But I just can't
do it tonight.

This is what
living's all about.

32:51.133 --> 32:52.667
The swelling's
starting to go down.

32:52.733 --> 32:54.767
I got less pain
than I had yesterday.

32:55.600 --> 32:57.367
Just giving it time to rest,

32:57.433 --> 32:59.067
giving my body
time to heal itself.

33:00.167 --> 33:02.333
Helping it out a bit
with the cold, and the heat.

33:02.433 --> 33:03.900
That really did the trick.

33:05.300 --> 33:06.633
There's still
a little swelling.

33:06.700 --> 33:08.067
There's still
a little bit of pain.

33:08.133 --> 33:11.633

was just to have
a little break.

(SIGHS)

33:14.567 --> 33:16.000
I was pushing things
a little too hard,

33:16.100 --> 33:18.067
and sometimes I do
that out here. It's tempting.

33:18.300 --> 33:21.333
I want to get that trail done,
I want to get back to
camp the same night.

33:21.433 --> 33:22.867
I just had to
slow down a little bit.

33:24.200 --> 33:25.967
As time went by,
I started to feel better.

33:27.633 --> 33:29.133
And I'm back in action again.

33:33.400 --> 33:35.000
Oh, look at the sun.

33:35.200 --> 33:36.867
That is such
a beautiful sight.

33:41.567 --> 33:44.800
Everything looks different
with sunlight on it,
and it feels different too.

33:44.867 --> 33:46.233
And my leg's feeling better.

33:47.033 --> 33:49.000
That rest was just
what it needed.

34:03.067 --> 34:04.533
Some great moose meat here.

34:04.700 --> 34:06.600
The moose are
coming back, too.
Everything's changing.

34:06.700 --> 34:09.833
This time of year,
you'll start seeing
moose on the hillside,

34:09.900 --> 34:11.233
they're enjoying
the sun out there.

34:13.533 --> 34:15.633
The grey jays are
coming around more.

34:19.067 --> 34:20.967
Everything's changing.

34:21.033 --> 34:23.067
It's the light part of
the winter, and it's a whole
different season up here.

34:23.833 --> 34:26.033
Mmm. That's good meat.

34:27.267 --> 34:29.500
A little bit of rest,
time to recover.

34:30.867 --> 34:32.733
Little bit of heat and cold,
that did the trick.

34:32.800 --> 34:35.500
My leg's feeling a lot
better than it was.

34:35.567 --> 34:36.833
Won't be long,
I'll be back up there

is kind of centred on food.

NARRATOR: After repairing
their long-range
black powder rifle,

35:04.600 --> 35:08.100
Chip and Agnes are
back on the trail
of a herd of muskox.

CHIP: If you see me waving,
come on over.
AGNES: Okay.

35:11.533 --> 35:13.867
-See you in a bit.
-Yep, good luck, honey.

35:14.267 --> 35:15.967
We saw this herd
from on top of the hill.

35:16.133 --> 35:17.600
So we came towards this

35:17.667 --> 35:20.500
and it's definitely
a whole herd of muskox.

35:22.733 --> 35:24.700
I'm hiding behind
here and, um...

35:24.800 --> 35:26.700
Hopefully they won't see me.

35:26.767 --> 35:28.333
And he's just
sneaking up closer

35:28.433 --> 35:30.767
and trying to get
a closer shot with his rifle.

35:31.300 --> 35:33.833
You can see the herd.
Oh, they're starting to run.

35:35.100 --> 35:36.800
CHIP: What I need
is a clear shot.

35:37.733 --> 35:39.300
Soon as I got one of them
I'm good to go.

35:52.067 --> 35:53.533
Oh, right there.

35:55.933 --> 35:57.967
I hit him! Agnes! Come on,

35:58.033 --> 35:59.400
I hit him!

36:01.833 --> 36:05.000
We have to keep on him
till he drops back and I can
get another clear shot.

36:11.633 --> 36:13.367
AGNES: I see it!
CHIP: Give him time
he'll lay down.

36:13.433 --> 36:16.033
The other ones will end up
having to leave him.

36:16.600 --> 36:18.933
I think we have an ox
falling out of the herd now.

36:19.067 --> 36:20.533
Now the jig is up.

36:20.833 --> 36:22.933
I want them to see me
so I can press them.

36:23.667 --> 36:26.867
I want the wounded one
to fall to the back so
I can clearly identify him.

36:33.533 --> 36:35.767
There he is
on the outside now.

36:35.867 --> 36:38.033
He's got somebody
in the way still.

36:38.100 --> 36:40.400
I'm basically, uh,
pressing the herd

36:40.567 --> 36:42.833
till it falls to the back,
then I can get a clear shot.

36:42.933 --> 36:44.333
It's the only way to do it.

36:44.400 --> 36:46.067
We can go all day
if we got to.

36:46.433 --> 36:47.800
These guys make it tough.

36:48.100 --> 36:51.367
It's a herd animal
and they watch each other

36:51.433 --> 36:52.833
so Chip's gotta stay close.

36:58.333 --> 36:59.667
(FIRES)

36:59.767 --> 37:01.000
Oh!

37:01.667 --> 37:03.500
I think I went
right over its head.

37:04.767 --> 37:06.167
I'm down to a shotgun now.

37:08.667 --> 37:10.100

to flank them on the side.

37:29.333 --> 37:32.600
Cool, here.
Don't need that,
don't need this crap...

37:35.500 --> 37:37.033
Okay. Excuse me.

37:56.600 --> 37:57.700
(FIRES)

37:57.867 --> 37:59.067
I slowed it down.

38:06.967 --> 38:08.267
I hunted a good ox down.

38:08.333 --> 38:10.500
It left the herd,
they left it.

38:10.633 --> 38:13.067
So I'm safe from them,
and he's my dinner.

38:13.367 --> 38:15.233
AGNES:
I love cold successful days.

38:17.200 --> 38:19.400
-Looks pretty fat, huh?
-CHIP: Yep.

38:19.500 --> 38:22.600
AGNES: Don't usually get to
hunt very many muskox.

38:22.700 --> 38:24.167
It's a permit hunt only.

38:24.233 --> 38:27.467
So, um, Chip and I
are lucky to be able
to do this hunt.

38:27.533 --> 38:30.233
We're gonna have
some good meat
for the rest of the winter.

38:30.333 --> 38:32.300
He's gonna give me
probably about
a good 300 pounds of meat.

38:32.600 --> 38:34.333
He's also gonna give me
an excellent fur for a rug.

38:34.400 --> 38:35.933
Maybe I'll make something
out of the horns there.

38:36.300 --> 38:38.100
AGNES: We'll give
this first piece to Jerry?

38:38.167 --> 38:40.167
-That's what I was thinking.
-Right on.

38:40.267 --> 38:41.800
CHIP: Well, I'm gonna
bring Jerry back the liver,

38:41.900 --> 38:44.233
then I'm gonna bring
him back the, um...

38:44.300 --> 38:45.433
The chest.

38:48.433 --> 38:49.567
And now I'm done.

38:51.133 --> 38:53.900
AGNES: One, two, three.
CHIP: Up.

38:53.967 --> 38:55.400
There you go.

38:55.500 --> 38:57.267
We got our ox on.

38:58.033 --> 38:59.033
(AGNES SPEAKING)

38:59.367 --> 39:00.833
CHIP: You're welcome.

39:01.533 --> 39:02.867
Yeah, thank you for your help.

39:03.567 --> 39:07.067
Well, the least we could do
is go bring Jerry
a chunk of meat.

39:09.433 --> 39:11.167
AGNES: Shall we?

39:24.567 --> 39:25.933
Hey, Jerry.

39:26.067 --> 39:27.133
CHIP: Not bad, huh?

39:27.267 --> 39:28.600
-Yeah.
-He's a chubby.

39:30.367 --> 39:32.900
Well, we could
boil this up tonight.
What do you think of that?

39:34.767 --> 39:35.867
CHIP: Yeah.

39:35.933 --> 39:37.200
AGNES: Okay. (LAUGHS)

39:42.200 --> 39:44.067
Fresh muskox.

39:44.233 --> 39:46.833
This is gonna be
the first meal of our ox,

39:46.900 --> 39:50.933
and, um, we're sharing it here
with our village elder, Jerry.

39:51.033 --> 39:53.467
It's something we don't
eat every day, muskox,

39:53.533 --> 39:56.533
so, um, it's gonna be
a good meal, good stories,

39:56.600 --> 39:58.200
and good friends.

39:58.267 --> 39:59.600
CHIP: Well, it feels good
to come here
to my friend's house

39:59.667 --> 40:01.467
and share a meal with him.

40:01.533 --> 40:03.933
When you got friends
close by, and I didn't have
the tools I needed at camp,

40:04.000 --> 40:05.367
to take care
of the problems I had,

40:05.567 --> 40:08.000
I could go to
the closest village,
and go hit up a friend.

40:08.133 --> 40:09.433
That black powder
ain't nothing

40:09.500 --> 40:10.900
like no high-powered rifle,
I'll tell you that.

40:11.267 --> 40:13.700
Chip had to walk like,
two miles,

40:14.967 --> 40:17.667
to get to the muskox
before he could even shoot.

40:17.733 --> 40:19.133
(LAUGHS)

40:19.867 --> 40:21.367
Good to eat
fat meat again, huh?

40:22.000 --> 40:23.367
CHIP: Mmm, yeah.

40:23.600 --> 40:25.500
Well, every day's
a successful day
in some way or another,

40:25.600 --> 40:26.667
but this is a meat day,

40:26.933 --> 40:28.633
and we done made some meat.
I'm happy.

40:29.467 --> 40:30.867
Man, I think I ate enough.

40:31.100 --> 40:34.333
I'm so glad muskox
was on the menu.

40:43.567 --> 40:45.267
SUE: It's all going
to come together,

40:46.400 --> 40:48.300
just seldom does it come
together the way you expect.

40:48.900 --> 40:53.100
You always got to have
a Plan B to your Plan A,
your Plan C, and your Plan Z.

41:05.600 --> 41:08.433
NARRATOR:
After getting her new loader
stuck in deep snow and ice,

41:09.467 --> 41:11.700
Sue was forced to use
a costlier method

41:11.767 --> 41:13.600
of getting the vehicle
across the tundra

41:13.867 --> 41:15.900
and back home
to Kavik River Camp.

41:20.367 --> 41:22.500
It's not a possibility
for me to continue

41:22.567 --> 41:24.167
to try and take
the loader out myself.

41:24.600 --> 41:26.600
Some things have come up
with the difficulty,

41:26.767 --> 41:28.900
the snow level,
the travel conditions.

41:28.967 --> 41:31.900
Uh, I... I'm...
I've had to come up with
a whole alternate plan.

41:32.233 --> 41:34.033
The Steigers and some trailers

41:34.233 --> 41:36.633
are now gonna do
the job I was going to do.

41:36.900 --> 41:39.333
You don't bring anything
across the tundra on sleds,

41:39.467 --> 41:40.867
leaving a lot of empty space.

41:40.967 --> 41:43.100
I've got things here
that can come out,

41:43.167 --> 41:44.767
so that's also
what I'm gonna do.

41:45.033 --> 41:47.033
I'm spending big bucks,
I might as well
get a big load.

41:48.567 --> 41:49.933
These are the goods.

41:54.467 --> 41:56.133
Hey, buddy, how you doing?

41:56.533 --> 41:58.033
-Pretty good.
-Cool.

41:58.100 --> 42:00.500
-Looks a lot nicer
than it did the other day.
-Yeah.

42:00.567 --> 42:03.133
Well, we fuelled it up,
checked it.

42:03.200 --> 42:04.900
She's not a bad old loader.

42:05.067 --> 42:07.267
Yeah, I'm gonna
walk around it
and make sure.

42:10.200 --> 42:12.433
Yeah, it'll be nice to get
this thing home.

42:16.000 --> 42:17.867
It's my little baby.

42:20.533 --> 42:21.933
There's no denying I'm...

42:22.000 --> 42:24.867
I'm mad as heck that
I can't drive it out myself.

42:25.833 --> 42:27.400
Um, 'cause that's...
You know I don't have

42:27.467 --> 42:30.433
a lot of dreams
and things on my bucket list,
that was one of 'em.

42:31.233 --> 42:33.733
But I've got to get home
and I don't have the luxury.

42:33.800 --> 42:37.200
So, let's just posse
it all up and get it out.

42:38.600 --> 42:41.633
All right. See you in Kavik.

42:42.567 --> 42:44.200
It's headed up
on its way to Kavik.

42:44.300 --> 42:46.000
I got to try and catch
a plane to get there.

42:46.067 --> 42:47.767
Boom, the two of us meet,
make out,

42:47.833 --> 42:49.433
and then the journey
really begins.

42:49.500 --> 42:50.767
Thank you so much, man.

42:50.833 --> 42:52.300
-You're welcome.
-Appreciate it.

42:52.367 --> 42:55.033
-I'm glad we were
able to do this.
-SUE: Oh, yeah.

42:55.167 --> 42:57.167
For me to stay
competitive in business,

42:57.233 --> 42:59.067
I've got to have
the equipment to do it.

42:59.133 --> 43:00.333
Time for the next step.
