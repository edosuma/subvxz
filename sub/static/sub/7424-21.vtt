00:00.393 --> 00:02.743
- From the moment we met...
<i>- We knew our lives</i>

00:02.744 --> 00:04.160
<i>would never be the same.</i>

00:04.162 --> 00:05.211
He saved my life.

00:05.213 --> 00:06.996
<i>And she saved mine.</i>

00:06.998 --> 00:10.799
We're destined.
<i>But we know it won't be easy.</i>

00:10.800 --> 00:13.634
Even though we have
<i>every reason to stay apart.</i>

00:13.654 --> 00:15.538
<i>We'll risk it all</i>
<i>to be together.</i>

00:15.540 --> 00:18.124
I am so in love with you.

00:18.126 --> 00:20.243
<i>Previously</i>
<i>on</i> Beauty & the Beast...

00:20.245 --> 00:22.712
So you were some kind
of guinea pig?

00:22.714 --> 00:24.446
Continually being harvested

00:24.448 --> 00:25.665
<i>for blood and tissue.</i>

00:25.667 --> 00:27.283
<i>I have been hunting Muirfield</i>

00:27.285 --> 00:29.335
for most of my life.

00:29.337 --> 00:31.053
<i>My doctor, when I was a kid,</i>

00:31.055 --> 00:32.088
I called her Vanessa.

00:32.090 --> 00:34.340
My mom was your doctor?

00:36.644 --> 00:38.394
Our shooter is actually trying
to kill Gabe,

00:38.396 --> 00:39.895
and I'm worried
that she's with him.

00:39.897 --> 00:41.063
Gabe is the target?

00:41.065 --> 00:42.798
<i>It's payback for building</i>

00:42.800 --> 00:45.234
<i>a RICO case</i>
<i>against the Bustamonté family.</i>

00:52.542 --> 00:54.026
Good news is I found him,

00:54.028 --> 00:56.162
but we got to get to him quick.

00:56.164 --> 00:58.798
♪

01:00.884 --> 01:03.586
It's a good thing you and I
have been working out

01:03.588 --> 01:06.706
because we have a rooftop pool
and Jacuzzi in our future.

01:06.708 --> 01:08.174
I spoke to Joe,

01:08.176 --> 01:09.925
and tomorrow we're all
rotating security detail

01:09.927 --> 01:12.072
at the Ashcroft Hotel.
Cool.

01:12.073 --> 01:13.797
Don't you want to know
who we're securing?

01:13.798 --> 01:15.298
Okay, well,

01:15.300 --> 01:16.716
who's got a hit on them

01:16.718 --> 01:18.217
by a major drug family

01:18.219 --> 01:19.719
who'd insist on being put up

01:19.721 --> 01:22.004
in a five-star hotel
instead of a safe house?

01:22.006 --> 01:24.607
Gabriel Lowan.
What are you playing on that thing?

01:24.609 --> 01:26.025
Just looking at my calendar.

01:26.027 --> 01:27.193
Well, speaking of calendars,

01:27.195 --> 01:28.677
Joe's making the assignments,

01:28.679 --> 01:31.030
and since I do have
a little bit of pull,

01:31.032 --> 01:32.481
we're guaranteed
a good shift.

01:32.483 --> 01:34.150
After which,
we can slip away.

01:34.152 --> 01:35.568
Security can use the pool?

01:35.570 --> 01:37.153
Well, when you have
an access card

01:37.155 --> 01:38.487
and look like us, you can.

01:38.489 --> 01:42.041
Tess, I'm-I'm ten days late.

01:42.043 --> 01:43.326
Oh.

01:43.328 --> 01:45.077
Don't "oh" like that.

01:45.079 --> 01:46.295
We haven't been partners
for a while,

01:46.297 --> 01:49.181
so maybe-maybe
we're off schedule.

01:49.183 --> 01:52.168
Sorry, it's just my head went
to <i>Breaking Dawn Part 2.</i>

01:52.170 --> 01:53.369
Okay, this isn't funny.

01:53.371 --> 01:54.887
What would I do?

01:54.889 --> 01:56.005
You're probably not.

01:56.007 --> 01:57.490
It's probably just stress.

01:57.492 --> 02:00.509
I mean, you're harboring
a half-human boyfriend.

02:00.511 --> 02:01.777
That's stressful.

02:01.779 --> 02:04.397
Right, stress.

02:04.399 --> 02:05.898
I thought we were careful.

02:05.900 --> 02:07.266
We were,

02:07.268 --> 02:08.401
and it's probably negative,

02:08.402 --> 02:10.386
but we will know
in three minutes.

02:12.239 --> 02:15.508
So should we talk
about the weather?

02:15.510 --> 02:17.893
Oh, I have
this security detail

02:17.895 --> 02:20.613
at this fancy hotel tomorrow.

02:20.615 --> 02:22.415
Catherine, this
can't happen.

02:22.417 --> 02:24.367
My DNA, passing that on...

02:24.369 --> 02:27.453
We don't know anything
for sure right now.

02:27.455 --> 02:31.090
It's just,
even if it was genetically okay,

02:31.092 --> 02:33.342
I'm-I'm supposed to be dead.

02:33.344 --> 02:35.344
You know, forget
coaching Little League,

02:35.346 --> 02:37.346
I'm a hunted man;
the child would be hunted, too.

02:40.385 --> 02:42.601
It's just my... it's my phone.

02:42.603 --> 02:45.604
It's a call,
it's a phone call,

02:45.606 --> 02:47.106
um, from Gabe.

02:47.108 --> 02:50.393
He probably wants to talk
about security detail.

02:50.395 --> 02:53.028
You know, if you were
in this position with him...

02:53.030 --> 02:55.314
Seriously? Right now?

02:55.316 --> 02:56.482
Vincent, I have told you,

02:56.484 --> 02:58.984
you have zero reason

02:58.986 --> 03:00.236
to be jealous of him.

03:00.238 --> 03:02.455
All right, just
take the call.

03:02.457 --> 03:04.907
Gabe.

03:04.909 --> 03:07.042
Hey, is everything okay?

03:10.580 --> 03:12.832
Uh, no, it's just the...

03:12.834 --> 03:14.467
timer on my phone.

03:14.469 --> 03:16.836
Yeah, I will be there early,

03:16.838 --> 03:20.005
and I will, uh,
I just got to go.

03:21.558 --> 03:23.309
It's negative.

03:23.311 --> 03:25.895
Okay.

03:25.897 --> 03:28.097
Okay.

03:30.767 --> 03:32.401
I'm sorry, okay?

03:32.403 --> 03:34.270
I'm sorry if I just flipped out.
It's okay.

03:34.272 --> 03:37.823
It's not like I want to have
a baby right now, either.

03:37.825 --> 03:39.875
"Right now"?

03:39.877 --> 03:41.827
You know what I mean.

03:41.829 --> 03:44.413
Are you sure because
you know that

03:44.415 --> 03:48.484
we can't ever have a baby ever.

03:48.486 --> 03:52.087
Vincent, you and I can't even go
to a restaurant together.

03:52.089 --> 03:53.839
Of course there is no baby.

03:53.841 --> 03:55.591
No house, no marriage.

03:55.593 --> 03:57.159
There are a lot
of people

03:57.161 --> 03:59.161
in this country who can't
get married either,

03:59.163 --> 04:02.681
and I'm not the kind of person
who needs a white picket fence

04:02.683 --> 04:05.050
and a big rock on my finger
to be happy.

04:05.052 --> 04:08.437
Yeah, I guess a date night
would be nice once in a while.

04:08.439 --> 04:10.940
But we've got, uh,

04:10.942 --> 04:14.109
rooftops and DVDs.

04:15.645 --> 04:17.196
I don't know.

04:17.197 --> 04:19.231
You know, maybe that's
my problem with Gabe.

04:19.233 --> 04:21.382
You know, someone like
that could give you

04:21.385 --> 04:23.652
all of those things, and
with me, you know, this...

04:23.654 --> 04:26.405
I don't know, what
I'm saying is that

04:26.407 --> 04:28.707
this is our present,

04:28.709 --> 04:31.410
and this is our future.

04:33.246 --> 04:35.297
As long as you are in it,

04:35.299 --> 04:37.416
I'm good.

04:37.418 --> 04:39.368
<i>I wish the Bustamontés</i>
<i>were trying to kill me.</i>

04:39.370 --> 04:41.086
<i>This place is insane.</i>

04:41.088 --> 04:43.055
Even the elevator
is amazing.

04:43.057 --> 04:45.374
I can't wait for
our shift to be over,

04:45.376 --> 04:47.810
get to the pool,
have a mai tai.

04:47.812 --> 04:49.595
This is New York,
not Hawaii.

04:49.597 --> 04:51.981
Okay, PMS,

04:51.983 --> 04:53.516
but I'm ordering
you one, too.

04:53.518 --> 04:55.551
You know, now that we know
you're not...

04:55.553 --> 04:57.886
Hi.
Hi. Hi.

04:59.306 --> 05:01.190
You ready to go
to the pool?

05:01.192 --> 05:03.075
I want to go now.
Okay.

05:03.077 --> 05:04.326
Bye. Say bye.

05:04.328 --> 05:06.579
Have fun. Bye.

05:08.249 --> 05:09.665
What was that?

05:09.667 --> 05:11.116
Well, I was being friendly.

05:11.118 --> 05:13.369
My poolside fantasy
was being threatened,

05:13.371 --> 05:14.837
and you were salivating.

05:14.839 --> 05:17.006
I was not salivating.

05:18.508 --> 05:21.210
Okay, it's just...
When you realize you're never

05:21.212 --> 05:22.911
going to have something,
you kind of look.

05:22.913 --> 05:24.930
But I'm fine. You know,

05:24.932 --> 05:27.132
it's not like I didn't know
what I was getting into.

05:27.134 --> 05:29.084
No, no, see, don't
do that girl thing

05:29.086 --> 05:30.636
where you just
say you're fine

05:30.638 --> 05:32.588
'cause you feel like you
agreed to some terms.

05:32.590 --> 05:34.440
Terms can change.
Tess, this isn't like you and Joe,

05:34.442 --> 05:37.309
where you can just agree to
keep your relationship hidden

05:37.311 --> 05:39.111
because you work for him.

05:39.113 --> 05:41.263
For Vincent and me,
there's no changing precincts.

05:41.265 --> 05:43.816
Okay, fine, but you know,
you still have a right

05:43.818 --> 05:45.601
to speak up and
say what you want,

05:45.603 --> 05:47.936
even if that's doling
out water wings.

05:47.938 --> 05:49.455
It's not.
Good.

05:49.457 --> 05:51.874
So you can hang out with
me in the adults-only area

05:51.876 --> 05:53.325
drinking a mai tai.

05:53.327 --> 05:56.545
Detectives, come in.

06:00.417 --> 06:02.585
It's over-the-top, but
it's the most secured

06:02.587 --> 06:04.803
hotel suite in Manhattan.
I hear you have

06:04.805 --> 06:06.922
your own, uh,
elevator, concierge?

06:06.924 --> 06:08.624
Yeah, but I could use
a good cup of coffee.

06:08.626 --> 06:11.010
Vargas, there is a great
espresso bar down in the lobby.

06:11.012 --> 06:12.511
Would you mind going
and getting me some?

06:12.513 --> 06:13.846
You want me
to get you coffee?

06:13.848 --> 06:15.431
Well, for all of us. On me.

06:15.433 --> 06:16.749
It's just that when
I said I needed you

06:16.751 --> 06:18.350
to come early,
I just meant Chandler.

06:18.352 --> 06:21.186
There's something important
I need to talk to you about.

06:21.188 --> 06:22.971
As long as you're buying,
I'm fine walking around,

06:22.973 --> 06:25.157
pretending to be a guest here.

06:26.861 --> 06:28.160
So what's so important?

06:28.162 --> 06:29.361
First,

06:29.363 --> 06:30.946
a list of witnesses

06:30.948 --> 06:32.481
from Bustamonté-related
drug cases.

06:32.483 --> 06:33.699
I thought you could go back,

06:33.701 --> 06:35.984
interview some.
Okay.

06:35.986 --> 06:38.754
But the reason I called you
here is I wanted to ask you

06:38.756 --> 06:40.272
about that guy you were with,

06:40.274 --> 06:42.007
the one who helped you kill
the sniper.

06:42.009 --> 06:45.127
I was alone.

06:45.129 --> 06:46.378
Really? You want to do this?

06:46.380 --> 06:48.631
Because I can go back
and run prints,

06:48.633 --> 06:50.599
or better, DNA.

06:53.219 --> 06:54.770
Okay.

06:54.772 --> 06:57.890
Um, that was my boyfriend.

06:57.892 --> 07:00.726
I know what he is.

07:01.778 --> 07:03.145
Look, I'm not gonna expose him.

07:03.147 --> 07:05.180
I just want to meet him.

07:05.182 --> 07:06.782
I'm sorry, I told you,
I don't...

07:06.784 --> 07:08.183
Catherine, after everything

07:08.185 --> 07:09.985
I shared with you
about Muirfield

07:09.987 --> 07:12.688
and what they did to me,
now you're gonna lie to my face?

07:12.690 --> 07:14.657
I'm not.

07:14.659 --> 07:16.024
I saw what he did to that sniper

07:16.026 --> 07:17.543
at the barn.
I told you,

07:17.545 --> 07:18.794
I don't know
what you're talking about.

07:18.796 --> 07:21.413
Yes, you do.

Gabe, okay, just calm down.

07:36.322 --> 07:37.938
I need to talk to him.

07:40.408 --> 07:41.942
A gun?

07:41.944 --> 07:43.410
Gabe, please stop.

07:43.412 --> 07:45.245
You're shaking, too.

07:45.247 --> 07:46.864
I'm just...

07:46.866 --> 07:48.582
I'm just surprised.

07:48.584 --> 07:49.733
Of course you are.

07:49.735 --> 07:51.451
I'm not gonna hurt you,

07:51.453 --> 07:54.070
but putting the gun down might,
you know,

07:54.072 --> 07:56.072
help keep the heat down.

08:00.628 --> 08:02.629
This is what Muirfield
did to you?

08:02.631 --> 08:04.264
Those procedures
you told me about

08:04.266 --> 08:05.933
when my mom was your doctor?

08:05.935 --> 08:07.618
Yes.

08:07.620 --> 08:09.520
But you were four.

08:09.522 --> 08:11.972
You've been like this since?

08:11.974 --> 08:13.557
How do you function?

08:13.559 --> 08:15.125
I have medication.

08:15.127 --> 08:16.226
Medication?

08:16.228 --> 08:17.394
It stops my DNA

08:17.396 --> 08:18.645
from expressing itself.

08:18.647 --> 08:22.533
Where do you get
something like that?

08:22.535 --> 08:24.267
Your mom.

08:24.269 --> 08:26.336
And later, as
I got older,

08:26.338 --> 08:28.689
I learned to synthesize
a version for myself,

08:28.691 --> 08:31.542
but it hasn't been working
as well.

08:31.544 --> 08:35.128
I seem to have developed
a bit of a resistance, clearly.

08:35.130 --> 08:37.246
This is why I need to
speak to your boyfriend.

08:37.249 --> 08:38.948
I think he can help me.

08:38.951 --> 08:40.551
I don't think
my boyfriend can...

08:40.553 --> 08:42.251
He can. For so long,

08:42.254 --> 08:43.837
I thought I was the only one

08:43.839 --> 08:46.122
and that Muirfield had
gotten rid of all the others,

08:46.124 --> 08:49.760
but then I got wind of homicides
coming out of your precinct

08:49.762 --> 08:52.012
with cross-species DNA.

08:52.014 --> 08:54.297
So I got hold of some samples,
and I studied them.

08:54.299 --> 08:58.268
Look, his DNA has properties
that mine doesn't.

08:58.270 --> 09:00.737
Okay, if we could
just swap samples.

09:00.739 --> 09:01.521
Gabe.

09:01.546 --> 09:02.941
I know I spearheaded
the task force,

09:02.942 --> 09:05.492
and you have no reason
to trust me,

09:05.494 --> 09:07.327
but I was just trying
to find him.

09:07.329 --> 09:09.162
His DNA may be able

09:09.164 --> 09:11.582
to help me wean
off of these meds.

09:11.584 --> 09:13.817
I want to help you, I do.

09:13.819 --> 09:16.152
But you're still protecting him.
I get it.

09:17.538 --> 09:20.323
But I may be able to help him,
too.

09:22.010 --> 09:24.928
I got you a ten-dollar
caffe con panna to try.

09:24.930 --> 09:27.664
Gabe has corrupted DNA.

09:27.666 --> 09:29.266
Excuse me?
Yeah. He's stable

09:29.268 --> 09:31.768
right now, but his eyes
are yellow, and, uh...

09:31.770 --> 09:33.136
What, is Gabe like Vincent?

09:33.138 --> 09:35.338
What is this,
the zombie apocalypse?

09:35.340 --> 09:37.841
The only person that can go in
there is Tyler, his girlfriend.

09:37.843 --> 09:39.526
She's bringing his
meds to make him normal,

09:39.528 --> 09:41.945
and until then, you can't
bring him any coffee.

09:45.683 --> 09:48.151
<i>I'm in here.</i>

09:48.153 --> 09:50.454
I know it's not a luxury

09:50.456 --> 09:51.855
movie cinema yet,

09:51.857 --> 09:54.024
but we have a full supply
of Red Vines.

09:54.026 --> 09:56.660
Yeah, I'm fine
with whatever.

09:56.662 --> 09:59.296
What's going on?

09:59.298 --> 10:02.716
Okay, this is gonna sound crazy,
but I know why

10:02.718 --> 10:04.635
you've been feeling weird
around Gabe.

10:04.637 --> 10:06.920
He finally made a move on you.

10:06.922 --> 10:08.388
No, Vincent, um,

10:08.390 --> 10:10.424
those procedures
that Muirfield did on him,

10:10.426 --> 10:14.394
they changed his DNA,
just like they did with you.

10:14.396 --> 10:16.713
Wait, how do you know this?
He told you?

10:16.715 --> 10:19.816
No, I saw it.
I-I saw him change.

10:19.818 --> 10:21.485
What are you talking about?

10:21.487 --> 10:22.719
His eyes,

10:22.721 --> 10:24.021
they turned yellow, his veins...

10:24.023 --> 10:25.439
It all makes
sense why my mom

10:25.441 --> 10:27.741
was his doctor,
why he hates Muirfield.

10:27.743 --> 10:29.660
It makes sense?
The guy's an ADA.

10:29.662 --> 10:31.028
Courtroom's a pretty
high-pressure situation.

10:31.030 --> 10:33.914
He would have mauled
a defendant by now.

10:33.916 --> 10:35.282
Except he has medication.

10:35.284 --> 10:37.117
Vincent,
he takes pills

10:37.119 --> 10:38.418
to keep him under control.

10:38.420 --> 10:39.670
Maybe they would work on you.

10:39.672 --> 10:41.038
Wait, I'm sorry, medication?

10:41.040 --> 10:42.506
I know, and I don't know

10:42.508 --> 10:44.174
how it works or what it does,

10:44.176 --> 10:46.376
but he goes to work every day,

10:46.378 --> 10:48.245
and he's fine.

10:48.247 --> 10:51.581
And he wants to meet you,
and you could ask him about it.

10:51.583 --> 10:54.084
You told him about me?
No, of course I didn't.

10:54.086 --> 10:54.980
He figured it out.

10:55.005 --> 10:56.854
What, that I'm the vigilante,
that we're connected?

10:56.855 --> 10:58.138
He is not looking
to bring you in.

10:58.140 --> 11:00.140
He's thinks that
you can help him.

11:00.142 --> 11:01.942
Maybe you can help each other.

11:01.944 --> 11:03.694
How?

11:03.696 --> 11:05.896
Okay, he's studied your DNA.

11:05.898 --> 11:07.948
Apparently, you each
have properties

11:07.950 --> 11:10.934
that might be beneficial.

11:10.936 --> 11:13.070
Catherine, this is the guy that
spearheaded the task force

11:13.072 --> 11:15.105
to hunt me down, okay?
It's a trap.

11:15.107 --> 11:17.374
For all we know, they could be
yellow contact lenses.

11:17.376 --> 11:18.992
I know what I saw.

11:18.994 --> 11:23.330
I'm suspicious, too, but every
day on that task force,

11:23.332 --> 11:26.083
it was Gabe who kept insisting
on bringing you in alive.

11:26.085 --> 11:27.334
How sweet of him.

11:27.336 --> 11:29.119
It isn't sweet at all.

11:29.121 --> 11:31.888
His-His medication isn't working
as well as it used to.

11:31.890 --> 11:33.423
So much for magic pills, huh?

11:33.425 --> 11:35.291
You should at least talk to him.

11:35.293 --> 11:37.811
What, at a public hotel?
In a suite

11:37.813 --> 11:39.679
with a private elevator,
no cameras,

11:39.681 --> 11:41.448
Tess is guarding the door.

11:43.151 --> 11:44.851
Vincent, from the first time
we talked,

11:44.853 --> 11:46.853
you said that you were trying
to find something

11:46.855 --> 11:47.971
to keep you from...

11:47.973 --> 11:50.490
Okay, but what about Muirfield?

11:50.492 --> 11:53.343
There'd be less risk of exposing
yourself to them.

11:53.345 --> 11:55.662
Maybe we could

11:55.664 --> 12:00.066
actually go to a movie
or a hotel pool,

12:00.068 --> 12:01.585
and we wouldn't need
to worry about

12:01.587 --> 12:03.653
something
setting you off.

12:03.655 --> 12:05.488
You know,
I thought that you said

12:05.490 --> 12:09.342
that you were okay with...
all of this.

12:09.344 --> 12:11.595
Vincent, I am,

12:11.597 --> 12:13.180
but aren't you curious?

12:13.182 --> 12:15.766
This is the guy that you
held up to be someone

12:15.768 --> 12:17.350
who could give me more,

12:17.352 --> 12:21.505
and it turns out that he's...
exactly like you.

12:21.507 --> 12:24.424
So you want
to go to a movie theater?

12:24.426 --> 12:27.144
Don't you?

12:31.365 --> 12:33.867
Private elevator
and garage?

12:33.869 --> 12:36.536
It's a presidential suite
made for presidents.

12:36.538 --> 12:38.989
And Gabe, apparently.

12:40.241 --> 12:43.359
Tyler, where the hell are you?

12:50.001 --> 12:51.367
You know, it'd be
kinda fun

12:51.369 --> 12:53.220
to stay in a place
like this someday.

12:53.222 --> 12:55.722
I did tell you they have
a rooftop pool?

12:55.724 --> 12:57.140
Yes.

13:01.230 --> 13:03.814
What?
Gunshots.

13:03.816 --> 13:05.182
I didn't hear...

13:06.568 --> 13:07.884
<i>That</i> I heard.

13:10.522 --> 13:12.772
Gabe? Gabe?!

13:14.000 --> 13:20.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

13:23.201 --> 13:24.701
Oh, my God.

13:24.703 --> 13:25.952
Where's Gabe?

13:25.954 --> 13:27.204
He's not here.

13:27.206 --> 13:29.005
How'd he get
out of here?

13:29.007 --> 13:30.423
The only way out is that way.

13:30.425 --> 13:32.626
So wait, he's all
creatured out,

13:32.628 --> 13:34.577
on the loose on the
streets of Manhattan?

13:34.579 --> 13:38.131
I think so.

13:40.813 --> 13:42.042
Security's gonna be here
any minute.

13:42.043 --> 13:43.242
What are we gonna
tell them?

13:43.244 --> 13:44.510
What <i>are</i> we
gonna tell them?

13:44.512 --> 13:47.878
Well, this guy shot at Gabe,
and Gabe fought him off.

13:47.903 --> 13:49.543
He'll say that
there was another attacker.

13:49.963 --> 13:51.580
And the roar the entire
hotel must've heard?

13:51.582 --> 13:53.948
What, he had the volume up
on Animal Planet?

13:53.950 --> 13:56.134
That's actually a good idea.
They're coming.

13:56.136 --> 13:57.919
Okay, see if you can find him
before he hurts anyone else.

13:57.921 --> 14:00.005
Okay.

14:01.123 --> 14:02.724
I just wanted
to go swimming today.

14:02.726 --> 14:03.925
Secure it. Secure it.

14:03.927 --> 14:05.260
Stand down.

14:05.262 --> 14:06.728
The suspects are G.O.A.

14:06.730 --> 14:09.481
Really? Where's the ADA?

14:11.685 --> 14:13.018
It's Joe.

14:13.020 --> 14:14.569
It's Vargas.

14:14.571 --> 14:16.271
I just got a call
from the hotel.

14:16.273 --> 14:17.906
What the hell is going on
over there?

14:17.908 --> 14:19.608
Uh, yeah, we had a bit
of a situation,

14:19.610 --> 14:22.077
but everybody seems
to be okay.

14:22.079 --> 14:23.328
Just tell me Lowan is okay.

14:23.330 --> 14:25.113
Um...

14:25.115 --> 14:26.865
That's not telling me he's okay.

14:26.867 --> 14:29.835
Joe, it's Chandler.
Lowan's been kidnapped.

14:29.837 --> 14:31.419
What?! You guys were on him!

14:31.421 --> 14:32.621
He wanted privacy, so...

14:32.623 --> 14:35.841
Did Vargas drag you up
to the pool?

14:35.843 --> 14:38.343
No.
Did he just ask...?

14:38.345 --> 14:39.928
Good new is, we have the body
of one of the attackers.

14:39.930 --> 14:41.463
Give me that.

14:41.465 --> 14:42.881
Joe, I wasn't at the pool, okay?

14:42.883 --> 14:44.182
I don't really care.

14:44.184 --> 14:45.550
Roll prints on our dead guy,

14:45.552 --> 14:47.835
find me some connection
to the Bustamontés,

14:47.837 --> 14:49.855
since that's probably who's got
him, and until we know

14:49.857 --> 14:51.723
more, you make sure
this stays in-house.

14:58.315 --> 15:00.615
Is that his phone?

15:00.617 --> 15:04.653
It's Gabe's girlfriend.
She might know where he went.

15:04.655 --> 15:07.489
Tyler, it's Detective Chandler.

15:07.491 --> 15:09.541
What's going on?
They're saying I can't come up.

15:09.543 --> 15:11.192
Is Gabe okay?

15:11.194 --> 15:13.027
Look, I know that you were out
to get his meds.

15:13.029 --> 15:16.047
Does that mean that you are
aware of what they're for?

15:16.049 --> 15:17.632
Oh, my God, is that what
happened up there?

15:17.634 --> 15:18.800
Did anybody see him?

15:18.802 --> 15:20.051
He escaped before
anyone got here.

15:20.053 --> 15:21.336
I'm the only one who knows.

15:21.338 --> 15:23.054
Do you have any idea
where he is?

15:23.056 --> 15:25.924
No, he's never been out in
the world in this state before.

15:25.926 --> 15:28.560
His medication hasn't been
working that well and...

15:28.562 --> 15:31.162
He told me, but he must've
come down by now.

15:31.164 --> 15:32.747
Once he's in this state,

15:32.749 --> 15:34.983
there is no coming down.
There isn't?

15:34.985 --> 15:36.101
Not without his meds.

15:36.103 --> 15:37.736
Okay, do you have them on you?

15:37.738 --> 15:39.604
Yeah.

15:39.606 --> 15:42.440
Okay, don't move.
I'll be right there.

15:42.442 --> 15:44.409
Okay, quit worrying about
meeting Sara's parents.

15:44.411 --> 15:45.794
We got a bigger problem
on our hands.

15:45.796 --> 15:47.061
Like there's someone else

15:47.063 --> 15:48.563
in the world now
with corrupted DNA.

15:48.565 --> 15:51.299
Oh, God, she <i>is</i> pregnant?

15:51.301 --> 15:52.284
No, Gabe.

15:52.286 --> 15:54.569
Gabe got her pregnant?

15:54.571 --> 15:56.087
Gabe is the one
with corrupted DNA.

15:56.089 --> 15:57.172
Where's the tranq gun?

15:57.174 --> 15:58.957
I'm sorry, what?

15:58.959 --> 16:00.458
Apparently Muirfield did
experiments on him

16:00.460 --> 16:01.843
when he was a child.

16:01.845 --> 16:04.462
He's a "suit."
How does he even function?

16:04.464 --> 16:05.614
He claims he's got pills.

16:05.616 --> 16:07.599
Pills? What kind of pills?

16:07.601 --> 16:10.302
JT, I don't know, okay? I just
found out about it myself.

16:10.304 --> 16:12.470
We spent ten years,
what did we miss?

16:12.472 --> 16:15.757
All I know is that he is
at-large in New York City.

16:15.759 --> 16:16.924
You know,
Muirfield gave it

16:16.926 --> 16:18.727
to him when
he was a kid.

16:18.729 --> 16:21.095
That's, like, 20 years earlier
than when you got it.

16:21.097 --> 16:22.948
It must've been
a different cocktail.

16:22.950 --> 16:25.283
He's like a First Gen.

16:25.285 --> 16:26.818
Yeah, First Gen. Great,
now where's the tranq?

16:26.820 --> 16:29.037
Uh, in the box
with the kitchen stuff.

16:29.039 --> 16:32.123
Oh, my God,
I can't go to dinner

16:32.125 --> 16:33.491
with Sara's parents.
It's not even safe.

16:33.493 --> 16:35.210
It was the Bustamontés.

16:35.212 --> 16:37.412
They're the ones
who just shot at Gabe.

16:37.414 --> 16:40.048
He's probably stalking them
right now.

16:40.050 --> 16:43.718
<i>It's one of Bustamonté's</i>
<i>friends from Gabe's files.</i>

16:43.720 --> 16:46.504
You getting
anything?

16:46.506 --> 16:49.507
Rubber, gasoline,
vinegar.

16:49.509 --> 16:51.926
That's what they use
to break down heroin.

16:51.928 --> 16:53.395
It's a drug gang,

16:53.397 --> 16:55.513
$25 million in
transactions a year.

16:55.515 --> 16:59.067
Speaking of, I got Gabe's meds
from his girlfriend.

16:59.069 --> 17:01.686
She said he needs,
like, ten of them,

17:01.688 --> 17:03.521
but there's more
than that.

17:03.523 --> 17:06.191
So maybe we can give one
to JT to analyze.

17:06.193 --> 17:07.992
Actually, JT just
pointed out

17:07.994 --> 17:10.310
that Gabe's, like,
First Gen and I'm...

17:10.313 --> 17:13.031
Okay, it's like a,
an old smart phone

17:13.032 --> 17:15.817
versus a new one;
they don't even use the same plug.

17:15.819 --> 17:17.502
Well, it's worth a shot.

17:17.503 --> 17:19.404
Catherine, I thought
you were fine

17:19.406 --> 17:20.954
with the way
things are now.

17:20.957 --> 17:23.474
Why are you being so negative
about this?

17:23.477 --> 17:25.844
I'm not. I just...
I don't want you

17:25.846 --> 17:27.212
to get your hopes up, okay?

17:27.214 --> 17:29.997
I'm fine if this doesn't work.

17:29.999 --> 17:32.217
Really? Because the minute
you found out about Gabe,

17:32.219 --> 17:34.185
you're off your post,
you're dragging me

17:34.187 --> 17:35.837
to some high-security hotel.
I thought that

17:35.839 --> 17:38.023
you would want to know about it.
Or maybe it's

17:38.025 --> 17:39.808
because you want the things
that I can't give you,

17:39.810 --> 17:41.643
and you thought this would be
the answer.

17:41.645 --> 17:45.647
Vincent, I keep telling you
I don't need a picket fence.

17:45.649 --> 17:47.399
But I do need
a guy

17:47.401 --> 17:51.453
who's going to at least <i>try</i>
to have a future.

17:55.157 --> 17:56.624
Something's up there.

17:56.626 --> 17:57.992
Gabe?

17:57.994 --> 17:59.861
I don't know,
but it's not human.

17:59.863 --> 18:02.196
Okay. You go that way,
I'll go around the other side.

18:31.827 --> 18:34.195
Who the hell are you?

18:34.197 --> 18:37.115
Hey, I was just, uh,
I was looking for someone.

18:39.401 --> 18:42.069
Okay, trust me, man,
you want to let me go.

18:53.516 --> 18:55.133
This some kind of retaliation?

18:55.135 --> 18:57.018
No, but there might be some
coming your way.

18:57.020 --> 18:58.219
Sounds like a threat.

18:58.221 --> 18:59.270
Just a warning.

19:31.620 --> 19:34.806
Someone else
back there?

19:34.808 --> 19:36.958
There was.

19:42.148 --> 19:45.016
Tess just found another address
in Gabe's files.

19:45.018 --> 19:47.018
It was written on hotel
stationery,

19:47.020 --> 19:49.521
so he probably just wrote
it down today.

19:49.523 --> 19:51.138
It's your place.

19:51.140 --> 19:53.158
What? How does he know
where I live?

19:53.160 --> 19:54.576
Wait.

20:00.148 --> 20:03.034
Tracking device.
He must've planted it this morning.

20:03.036 --> 20:06.487
Of course, coming
to my precinct, the task force.

20:06.489 --> 20:08.423
Gabe's primal drive isn't
to go after the Bustamontés.

20:08.425 --> 20:09.674
It's to go after you.

20:12.512 --> 20:15.880
Um, I'm just,
I'm not feeling great,

20:15.882 --> 20:17.715
and I don't want...

20:17.717 --> 20:19.934
I don't want to get you
and your parents sick.

20:21.855 --> 20:23.888
Um, hold on.
I got a call waiting.

20:23.890 --> 20:27.341
Hey.

20:27.343 --> 20:30.111
Hey, you at home? You gotta get
out of there right now.

20:30.113 --> 20:32.113
Gabe is after me, and he
probably doesn't look

20:32.115 --> 20:33.364
like an ADA right now.

20:33.366 --> 20:36.618
Oh, God. Uh, okay. Um, okay.

20:36.620 --> 20:38.703
Sara?

20:38.705 --> 20:42.356
Oh, that's right, he took it.

20:42.358 --> 20:44.158
Nothing, um...

20:44.160 --> 20:45.910
I just can't find the...

20:49.883 --> 20:52.083
I gotta call you back.

21:14.244 --> 21:17.521
I'm not the one you're looking
for. My DNA's real boring.

21:17.522 --> 21:20.055
How about we just relax,
talk this out?

21:25.695 --> 21:27.228
Easy fella.

21:35.372 --> 21:38.706
Vincent, it's not working.

21:38.708 --> 21:40.375
I know.

21:53.556 --> 21:57.959
New rule: No one takes the tranq
gun unless we have a spare.

21:59.228 --> 22:00.895
You okay?

22:00.897 --> 22:02.797
Yeah.

22:02.799 --> 22:06.134
I just think
until about a minute ago, I...

22:06.136 --> 22:08.853
I was still telling myself
it's contact lenses.

22:08.855 --> 22:10.738
Vargas.

22:10.740 --> 22:12.190
Okay, don't react,

22:12.192 --> 22:13.808
because he's not exactly
in a state

22:13.810 --> 22:15.493
to come back to the precinct
yet, but we found Gabe.

22:15.495 --> 22:16.811
Oh, thank God.

22:16.813 --> 22:18.696
Sorry, not reacting,
it's just...

22:18.698 --> 22:20.164
Joe's been giving me crap
all day,

22:20.166 --> 22:21.866
like this is my fault.

22:21.868 --> 22:23.751
What were you supposed to do,
guard the 47th story window?

22:23.753 --> 22:25.036
Well, he's just stressed out

22:25.038 --> 22:26.254
and taking it out on me

22:26.256 --> 22:27.755
'cause he thinks he can.

22:27.757 --> 22:29.340
But you know what? He can't.

22:29.342 --> 22:30.925
I won't say anything
about finding Gabe.

22:30.927 --> 22:32.343
Let him sweat it out.

22:32.345 --> 22:34.996
- Okay. I'll call you later.
- All right.

22:34.998 --> 22:37.432
You're going to save some
of that to analyze, right?

22:37.434 --> 22:38.933
He and Gabe are
different generations.

22:38.935 --> 22:43.221
Yes, I understand
the whole phone analogy,

22:43.223 --> 22:45.506
but in the end,
they're both phones, so...

22:45.508 --> 22:48.359
DNA is not a fancy gadget
made in China.

22:48.361 --> 22:52.030
I know that you guys
worked on a cure for years,

22:52.032 --> 22:55.817
but now there's someone else
with corrupted DNA, too.

22:55.819 --> 22:57.652
You don't know what
it was like back then.

22:57.654 --> 22:59.186
I gave him stuff
to just "explore"

22:59.188 --> 23:00.455
that nearly killed him.

23:00.457 --> 23:02.206
Okay, so what if

23:02.208 --> 23:03.691
we just run the labs first?

23:03.693 --> 23:04.959
Why can't you just be fine

23:04.961 --> 23:06.360
with the way things are now?

23:06.362 --> 23:08.046
I am.

23:08.048 --> 23:10.081
But I really don't think
that he should have to believe

23:10.083 --> 23:11.833
that this is his only future.

23:11.835 --> 23:15.219
I don't understand why
you're not jumping at this.

23:15.221 --> 23:17.055
This is what you guys
have been working for,

23:17.057 --> 23:18.372
for ten years.

23:18.374 --> 23:19.641
He spent every hour

23:19.643 --> 23:22.043
of every day
searching for a cure.

23:22.045 --> 23:24.562
He failed, over and over,

23:24.564 --> 23:26.230
till he was so filled
with self-loathing

23:26.232 --> 23:27.732
you wouldn't have
recognized him.

23:27.734 --> 23:30.818
And I gave him hell for
quitting, but looking back,

23:30.820 --> 23:33.071
it was the right thing for him.

23:33.073 --> 23:36.190
He finally grieved
his normal self,

23:36.192 --> 23:38.109
got to a place of acceptance.

23:38.111 --> 23:40.612
Do you really want
to unravel that?

23:42.998 --> 23:46.284
How you guys doing in here?
'Cause I think he's waking up.

23:58.914 --> 24:00.965
What happens if he wakes up
and it doesn't work?

24:00.967 --> 24:02.567
Look.

24:13.696 --> 24:15.196
It works.

24:16.098 --> 24:18.399
On him.

24:19.535 --> 24:22.704
Gabe, it's Catherine.

24:22.706 --> 24:24.155
This is JT.

24:25.240 --> 24:27.942
I'm the one
you almost had for a snack.

24:27.944 --> 24:30.328
And that is...
Vincent.

24:30.330 --> 24:31.996
He's the one you're looking for.

24:31.998 --> 24:34.816
I, um... I hope I didn't, um...

24:34.818 --> 24:36.384
do anything.

24:36.386 --> 24:38.419
Uh, you did.

24:39.304 --> 24:41.756
I'm sorry about that.

24:41.758 --> 24:45.459
I'm not aware
when I'm like that.

24:45.461 --> 24:47.495
You're not conscious
when you're...?

24:47.497 --> 24:49.347
- No.
- You were conscious

24:49.349 --> 24:51.149
when you put that
tracking device on Catherine.

24:51.151 --> 24:53.134
I was just desperate
to find you.

24:53.136 --> 24:55.186
If you're looking for stronger
meds, he doesn't have any.

24:55.188 --> 24:56.821
I'm looking for help.

24:56.823 --> 24:58.656
Don't know how we can
help you with that,

24:58.658 --> 25:00.908
because it seems you've got
everything under control.

25:00.910 --> 25:03.561
You got meds to function...

25:03.563 --> 25:05.380
you don't really have
to hide from Muirfield.

25:05.382 --> 25:07.465
You think you got
the short end of the stick?

25:07.467 --> 25:09.751
You walk around like yourself
most of the time, right?

25:09.753 --> 25:11.052
Without any meds?

25:11.054 --> 25:12.820
If I didn't take mine...

25:14.339 --> 25:15.673
Well, you saw.

25:15.675 --> 25:18.176
I'd be out of control
all the time.

25:18.178 --> 25:20.211
And you said they're not working

25:20.213 --> 25:21.396
as well anymore, right?

25:21.398 --> 25:22.764
I'm developing a resistance,

25:22.766 --> 25:25.216
and fast. Unless
something changes...

25:25.218 --> 25:27.835
Be a pretty scary ADA.

25:27.837 --> 25:30.838
I will end my life
before it gets to that.

25:34.026 --> 25:36.277
Okay, so how do
I fit into this?

25:36.279 --> 25:39.397
You said Vincent's DNA has
different properties than yours.

25:40.515 --> 25:42.400
You want my DNA?

25:42.402 --> 25:43.468
Just a blood sample.

25:43.470 --> 25:44.569
The cocktail that Muirfield

25:44.571 --> 25:46.821
gave your unit
has something in it

25:46.823 --> 25:48.656
that stabilizes your DNA.

25:48.658 --> 25:50.124
I want to see if
I can separate that out,

25:50.126 --> 25:51.843
get it to replicate
in my own cells.

25:51.845 --> 25:53.911
Then he wouldn't need
the medication.

25:53.913 --> 25:56.547
Look, I don't know what
stabilizers you think I've got,

25:56.549 --> 25:58.249
but I can't control it
when it happens.

25:58.251 --> 26:00.418
Which is why I live

26:00.420 --> 26:02.220
here in hiding,
why I just killed someone

26:02.222 --> 26:04.222
trying to look for you,
and why...

26:04.224 --> 26:06.507
why this is my future.

26:06.509 --> 26:08.926
Well, from where
I stand,

26:08.928 --> 26:10.728
I'd choose your future
over mine.

26:10.730 --> 26:12.880
Look, I don't know if
it'll work, but I am happy

26:12.882 --> 26:15.233
to give you
some of my meds to try.

26:15.235 --> 26:17.051
Consider it a fair trade?

26:20.606 --> 26:22.857
Vincent, can I talk to you
for a second?

26:22.859 --> 26:25.526
Yeah.

26:27.329 --> 26:28.896
What I said before,

26:28.898 --> 26:30.915
about needing someone
who's going to try...

26:30.917 --> 26:32.617
you've already tried
for ten years.

26:32.619 --> 26:35.119
So you don't have to do
this for me. I'm fine.

26:35.121 --> 26:37.672
Okay, look,
I appreciate you saying this...

26:37.674 --> 26:39.173
I'm not just saying it.

26:39.175 --> 26:40.641
You heard him.

26:40.643 --> 26:42.794
The stuff they put in him,
it's different.

26:42.796 --> 26:44.262
You guys, you're different.

26:44.264 --> 26:46.047
In a lot of ways.

26:46.049 --> 26:47.799
It might not work.

26:47.801 --> 26:49.383
I don't know,
it could make you worse.

26:49.385 --> 26:52.353
Is this what you've been
talking to JT about?

26:52.355 --> 26:54.472
It isn't worth the risk.

26:54.474 --> 26:57.275
Are you trying to manage
my emotional roller coaster?

26:57.277 --> 26:59.777
A little.

26:59.779 --> 27:01.362
Okay.

27:01.364 --> 27:03.698
Look, after what we just saw,

27:03.700 --> 27:05.199
there's no going back, okay?

27:05.201 --> 27:06.734
The car's already
going up the tracks.

27:06.736 --> 27:09.070
But if it doesn't work,

27:09.072 --> 27:10.371
and I've unraveled you...

27:10.373 --> 27:12.323
It doesn't matter.

27:13.441 --> 27:16.227
This time, I got you in my life.

Do you have a metallic taste
in your mouth?

27:56.095 --> 27:57.644
Yeah, I do.

27:57.646 --> 27:59.430
Well, that's a sign
that it's in your system

27:59.432 --> 28:00.681

Oh, about that chop shop...

Oh, my God, I meant to tell you
about that.

28:04.770 --> 28:06.103
You've been a little busy.

28:06.105 --> 28:08.105
I figured you were there
looking for me,

28:08.107 --> 28:10.240
which is why I told Joe that's
where the kidnappers took me.

28:10.242 --> 28:11.442
And that your altercation

28:11.444 --> 28:12.826
with Chewy Bustamonté

28:12.828 --> 28:14.995
gave me the distraction
I needed to escape.

28:14.997 --> 28:17.364
Okay, that guy's name is Chewy?

28:18.718 --> 28:20.017
Hey, ask him about the body.

28:20.019 --> 28:21.452
Oh, I took care of that, too.

28:21.454 --> 28:22.736
Some other guy jumped me,

28:22.738 --> 28:24.238
I had to defend myself.

28:24.240 --> 28:25.789
He took the fall for us.

28:25.791 --> 28:27.875
Well, it's the least I could do.

28:27.877 --> 28:29.576
Thanks.

28:29.578 --> 28:31.678
Okay, this is so weird.

28:31.680 --> 28:33.347
It's... you guys can
hear each other

28:33.349 --> 28:34.581
and you're not even
on speakerphone.

28:34.583 --> 28:36.183
Hey, Gabe, how long

28:36.185 --> 28:37.384
does the pill last for?

28:37.386 --> 28:38.719
Well, I know for me,

28:38.721 --> 28:40.054
uh, with my resistance,

28:40.056 --> 28:41.805
it lasts four hours, tops.

28:41.807 --> 28:43.924
In your case, you may get
as many as 12.

28:43.926 --> 28:45.893
Who knows, but that's
where I started.

28:45.895 --> 28:47.144
Still plenty of time to have

28:47.146 --> 28:48.929
a decent night out.

28:48.931 --> 28:51.315
Now I gotta go talk
to the press,

28:51.317 --> 28:54.935
tell them how I plan to put away
the Bustamontés.

28:56.654 --> 28:58.288
He's not bad for a suit.

28:58.290 --> 29:01.075
And so begins
a very unique bromance.

29:01.077 --> 29:02.493
Okay, enough.

29:03.328 --> 29:04.962
So, what do you want to do?

29:04.964 --> 29:08.082
We've got 12 hours until
I turn back into a pumpkin.

29:08.084 --> 29:10.551
I was thinking maybe we could
have that date night

29:10.553 --> 29:12.336
we've been talking about?

29:12.338 --> 29:14.671
Movie?

29:14.673 --> 29:17.091
I have something
better in mind.

29:17.093 --> 29:19.426
♪

29:19.428 --> 29:20.844
There's a lot of people.

Not really.

You still have
that metallic taste?

29:23.349 --> 29:24.598
Yeah.

29:24.600 --> 29:26.016
It's not like Muirfield's

29:26.018 --> 29:28.018
gonna be at a hotel pool,
so we're good.

29:28.020 --> 29:29.770
We're just a normal couple
going for a swim.

29:29.772 --> 29:31.188
Catherine, I can't swim.

29:32.357 --> 29:34.191
I'm kidding.

29:35.026 --> 29:36.410
Well, I could go

29:36.412 --> 29:38.195
some water wings
in the gift shop.

29:38.197 --> 29:41.198
I kind of think we spent enough
at the gift shop, don't you?

30:09.227 --> 30:13.030
You know, I haven't been
in a pool for over a decade.

30:13.032 --> 30:14.982
this will be the first
of many date nights.

30:14.984 --> 30:18.569
We can go to a restaurant,
a baseball game...

30:18.571 --> 30:20.320
I have tomorrow off.

30:20.322 --> 30:23.373
We could have Red Vines
in an actual movie theater.

30:23.375 --> 30:24.791
Interesting.

30:24.793 --> 30:28.528
You go with Red Vines, and...

30:28.530 --> 30:31.715
I'm going along more with
the thought of, uh...

30:31.717 --> 30:33.167
a picket fence.

30:33.169 --> 30:35.702
Are you teasing me?

30:35.704 --> 30:37.804
No.

30:37.806 --> 30:39.840
I'm not, I want it.

30:39.842 --> 30:43.427
I want us to be
in a relationship

30:43.429 --> 30:46.379
that's moving
forward to something.

30:46.381 --> 30:49.683
I do. And I just,
I couldn't admit it before

30:49.685 --> 30:51.685
because it wasn't
even a possibility.

30:51.687 --> 30:53.353
I want it, too.

30:53.355 --> 30:56.607
Ah, so you <i>were</i> lying.

30:56.609 --> 30:58.909
I wasn't lying.

30:58.911 --> 31:01.612
I just didn't know
that's what I wanted.

31:01.614 --> 31:03.413
I've never wanted

31:03.415 --> 31:06.667
to have a future with someone
before I found you.

31:06.669 --> 31:11.071
And all it takes is
a luxury pool, and she's in.

31:11.073 --> 31:14.541
Yes, I am completely
materialistic and shallow,

31:14.543 --> 31:16.627
and I just want you
as my Sugar Daddy.

31:16.629 --> 31:19.412
Oh, hold up, I might
have to get a job first.

31:19.414 --> 31:21.431
Right, sorry.

31:21.433 --> 31:24.351
I should probably take things
a little more slowly.

31:24.353 --> 31:27.771
You know what?

31:27.773 --> 31:30.140
I don't want to take
things slowly.

31:30.142 --> 31:32.276
Vincent,

31:32.278 --> 31:33.944
like you said,
this doesn't solve everything.

31:33.946 --> 31:35.946
There's still Muirfield...
And you're a cop,

31:35.948 --> 31:38.565
you could put us
into witness protection.

31:40.068 --> 31:41.902
It doesn't matter.

31:41.904 --> 31:43.320
Right now, all that matters

31:43.322 --> 31:45.322
is that we are here.

31:45.324 --> 31:47.741
It is a pretty sweet pool.

31:47.743 --> 31:49.743
It's not just the pool.

31:49.745 --> 31:51.611
I mean, I'm out.

31:51.613 --> 31:54.214
You know,
I don't have to worry about

31:54.216 --> 31:57.301
being provoked by something
or someone or...

31:57.303 --> 31:59.953
if I'm in control.

31:59.955 --> 32:02.389
I can relax.

32:02.391 --> 32:04.841
And I can be with you.

32:17.855 --> 32:20.607
Excuse me, Ms. Chandler?

32:21.526 --> 32:23.977
Um, we have an access card.

32:23.979 --> 32:26.029
There's a call
on the house phone for you.

32:26.031 --> 32:27.748
How's the water?

32:27.750 --> 32:29.449
Heated? Salt?

32:29.451 --> 32:31.335
Hey, JT, what's going on?

32:31.337 --> 32:33.754
You know how chemo can get rid
of cancer cells,

32:33.756 --> 32:35.289
but also make you insanely sick?

32:35.291 --> 32:38.375
Well, these pills are like that
times 1,000 for Vincent.

32:38.377 --> 32:39.843
He keeps taking them,

32:39.845 --> 32:41.428
they'll kill him in...

32:41.430 --> 32:43.463
two, three years, tops.

32:43.465 --> 32:46.383
But Gabe's been taking them
since he was a kid.

32:46.385 --> 32:47.768
And like I warned you,

32:47.770 --> 32:49.019
Gabe's a different generation.

32:49.021 --> 32:51.521
It affects him differently.

32:51.523 --> 32:55.309
Okay. Can you not talk to me
like I'm five?

32:56.644 --> 32:58.345
Sorry,

32:58.347 --> 33:00.814
Sara just yelled at me
for bailing on dinner.

33:00.816 --> 33:04.451
And I'm disappointed, too.

33:04.453 --> 33:07.187
I know.

33:08.522 --> 33:09.740
You know what--
you've had to break

33:09.742 --> 33:11.074
the bad news to him
enough times.

33:11.076 --> 33:12.626
This one's on me-- I'll do it.

33:15.079 --> 33:18.248
Is everything okay?

33:20.218 --> 33:22.369
Yeah, but he said
they work, right?

33:22.371 --> 33:23.720
Vincent, it's
not worth it.

33:23.722 --> 33:26.340
What, come on, three good years

33:26.342 --> 33:28.558
of us doing stuff like this?

33:28.560 --> 33:30.260
That's more of a future
than we had this morning.

33:30.262 --> 33:31.845
No, it isn't.

33:31.847 --> 33:33.347
Yes...

33:33.349 --> 33:35.982
I want those things,
but not without you.

33:37.652 --> 33:40.320
I'm just, I'm so sorry
that I pushed you

33:40.322 --> 33:42.356
and took you up
the roller coaster.

33:42.358 --> 33:43.390
I'm fine.

33:43.392 --> 33:44.524
Don't say "fine."

33:44.526 --> 33:45.558
That's what I say
when I'm not fine.

33:45.560 --> 33:47.444
Yeah, I noticed.

33:50.281 --> 33:51.948
Okay, what if I just take them

33:51.950 --> 33:53.750
once a week, or a month.

33:53.752 --> 33:55.619
Uh, special occasions.

33:55.621 --> 33:57.587
I'm really gonna enjoy
a special occasion knowing

33:57.589 --> 34:00.207
that you've taken something
that is killing you.

34:01.509 --> 34:03.493
Vincent, you have
to swear to me that

34:03.495 --> 34:05.295
you're not gonna
take another pill.

34:05.297 --> 34:07.631
Okay.

34:07.633 --> 34:10.384
No, swear.

34:14.022 --> 34:16.056
I swear, okay?

34:16.058 --> 34:18.358
Okay.

34:18.360 --> 34:19.609
Now, I probably got

34:19.610 --> 34:21.094
five good hours left.

34:21.096 --> 34:23.813
So can we just enjoy it?

34:23.815 --> 34:25.532
Yeah.

34:25.534 --> 34:27.534
I don't really want
to go swimming anymore

34:27.536 --> 34:29.668
but we can go to my place.

34:29.670 --> 34:30.987
My sister's out
for the night.

34:30.989 --> 34:33.039
Perfect.

Vincent?

35:59.599 --> 36:01.015
Not so fun, is it, huh?

36:47.346 --> 36:48.980
Let him go.

36:58.857 --> 37:01.159
You didn't...

37:01.161 --> 37:03.528
It's been over 12 hours.

37:03.530 --> 37:05.830
Yeah.

37:05.832 --> 37:08.399
I just wanted to go to
the movies with you.

37:16.793 --> 37:18.259
You should leave.

37:18.261 --> 37:20.094
And considering you
took another pill,

37:20.096 --> 37:21.629
you should probably
take the stairs.

37:23.098 --> 37:25.249
Okay.

37:30.606 --> 37:32.106
I'm about to meet
with someone.

37:32.108 --> 37:33.524
Okay, well, that can
wait five minutes.

37:33.526 --> 37:35.693
Look, I get that
you can't give me

37:35.695 --> 37:37.362
special treatment
'cause we're supposed to be,

37:37.364 --> 37:39.063
you know, "in the closet,"
but I'm not fine

37:39.065 --> 37:41.032
with you taking out
your stress on me.

37:41.034 --> 37:42.316
You shouldn't be.
Just because we're sleeping together.

37:42.318 --> 37:43.568
I mean, what,

37:43.570 --> 37:44.952
is that just your way
of trying to prove

37:44.954 --> 37:46.070
to everyone there's
nothing going on here?

37:46.072 --> 37:47.205
Yes.
Or, you know, maybe now

37:47.207 --> 37:48.489
that we're involved,

37:48.491 --> 37:50.575
you just don't respect me
anymore as a cop.

37:50.577 --> 37:53.411
Tess, I said yes.

37:53.413 --> 37:56.297
You don't respect me anymore?

37:56.299 --> 37:59.133
I'm trying... to make sure

37:59.135 --> 38:00.668
that every time I look at you,

38:00.670 --> 38:02.587
everyone in this whole
damn precinct can't see

38:02.589 --> 38:06.174
all over my face
that I am madly...

38:06.176 --> 38:08.459
wildly in love with you.

38:12.514 --> 38:14.682
I love you.

38:23.409 --> 38:24.776
Lieutenant?

38:24.778 --> 38:26.327
Special Agent
Reynolds, FBI.

38:26.329 --> 38:28.279
Can I have a minute?
Fine.

38:28.281 --> 38:31.148
And don't ever do that again.

38:31.150 --> 38:32.533
Okay?

38:32.535 --> 38:34.285
Okay.

38:37.322 --> 38:40.091
Transfer order
for the Bustamonté assassin.

38:40.093 --> 38:42.176
The guy with the
window pane in his gut.

38:42.178 --> 38:44.295
What's the FBI want with him?

38:44.297 --> 38:46.714
It's a connected case.

38:46.716 --> 38:49.634
Confidential.

38:53.338 --> 38:56.057
Haven't seen you guys
in a while.

38:56.059 --> 38:57.942
When was that?

38:57.944 --> 38:59.727
Those three vics in the subway?

38:59.729 --> 39:01.395
Rings a bell.

39:02.564 --> 39:04.732
Have a good day, Lieutenant.

39:15.410 --> 39:17.361
I have to finish
making my statement,

39:17.363 --> 39:18.629
so apologize fast.

39:18.631 --> 39:20.715
I'm sorry.
Very funny.

39:20.717 --> 39:22.717
Yeah, well, at
least the pill

39:22.719 --> 39:24.669
didn't take away
my sense of humor.

39:26.339 --> 39:29.090
Look, Cat, the reason I took it

39:29.092 --> 39:33.010
is because I really do
want a future with you.

39:33.012 --> 39:34.896
A normal future with you.

39:34.898 --> 39:38.182
And I want a future
with you, too.

39:38.184 --> 39:39.851
But I don't care if it's normal,

39:39.853 --> 39:41.519
I just care that you're in it.

39:42.905 --> 39:44.906
Vincent, I love you
the way you are,

39:44.908 --> 39:48.326
and I don't need you
to be cured.

39:48.328 --> 39:50.945
I just need you to not give up.

39:50.947 --> 39:52.780
Because I do see
a future for us

39:52.782 --> 39:54.415
that's not just in your hideout.

39:54.417 --> 39:56.284
And I know that you're afraid
of the roller coaster...

39:56.286 --> 39:58.119
No, it's not just that.

40:00.539 --> 40:02.874
Okay, I was worried, if...

40:02.876 --> 40:05.409
I tried a cure, and it didn't
work out, you would think

40:05.411 --> 40:07.912
that I might be
like this forever.

40:07.914 --> 40:10.264
You know, that-that
future you want

40:10.266 --> 40:12.433
wouldn't be possible and...

40:12.435 --> 40:14.969
I don't know, you might leave.

40:14.971 --> 40:17.104
I'm not going anywhere.

40:17.106 --> 40:19.457
I am in the car
with you for all the...

40:19.459 --> 40:23.094
ups and downs
and loop-de-loops.

40:23.096 --> 40:24.946
"Loop-de-loops"?

40:24.948 --> 40:27.198
Oh, okay, well,

40:27.200 --> 40:29.483
in that case I will keep trying.

40:29.485 --> 40:31.502
And if it doesn't work out...

40:31.504 --> 40:33.437
it's okay.

40:35.040 --> 40:37.074
But at least we can fantasize.

40:37.076 --> 40:38.659
Fantasize?

40:38.661 --> 40:40.378
That's what was
so fun about the pool.

40:40.380 --> 40:42.129
We... it wasn't the setting,

40:42.131 --> 40:44.916
it was getting to think
about our future.

40:44.918 --> 40:47.418
And we don't need a pill

40:47.420 --> 40:50.922
or a magnetic access card
to do that.

40:50.924 --> 40:52.840
Well, in that case,

40:52.842 --> 40:56.227
I can fantasize about our
eight cross-species children

40:56.229 --> 40:57.478
right here in the alley.
Okay.

40:57.480 --> 40:59.680
Three--
let's just say three.

40:59.682 --> 41:01.182
And a dog.

41:01.184 --> 41:03.568
Okay, a small dog because
those big dogs,

41:03.570 --> 41:05.469
they don't really like me.
Okay, three

41:05.471 --> 41:06.687
and a small dog.

41:06.689 --> 41:08.522
But if you take another pill,

41:08.524 --> 41:10.775
I'm taking the kids
and the dog.

41:12.110 --> 41:15.329
♪ You're my guiding light

41:15.331 --> 41:19.817
♪ You're my
guiding light. ♪

41:22.288 --> 41:23.654
Hi, handsome.

41:23.656 --> 41:25.089
Hey.

41:25.091 --> 41:27.375
We celebrating
or drowning our sorrows?

41:27.377 --> 41:29.210
We're splitting
the difference.

41:29.212 --> 41:31.762
I ran the test on
Vincent's blood.

41:32.965 --> 41:34.432
It'll work.

41:34.434 --> 41:35.883
I'll drink to that.

41:39.805 --> 41:41.222
Just one minor detail.

41:42.524 --> 41:44.575
What you need from him...

41:44.577 --> 41:45.893
he won't survive.

41:48.639 --> 41:51.774
