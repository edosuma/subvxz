00:02.300 --> 00:04.500
<i>This cemetery has been</i>
 <i>connected to our parish</i>

00:04.500 --> 00:07.000
 <i>for almost 200 years.</i>

00:08.900 --> 00:09.700
3:00 am...

00:09.700 --> 00:11.800
the water main broke;
felt like an earthquake.

00:11.800 --> 00:14.800
Coffins were bursting
out of the ground.

00:16.500 --> 00:17.900
Are you all right?

00:18.600 --> 00:21.100
I've had some stomach
problems lately.

00:21.200 --> 00:23.600
This isn't helping.

00:23.600 --> 00:25.000
Last person was buried
here over 50 years ago.

00:25.000 --> 00:26.700
I don't know how you're gonna
figure out who's who.

00:26.800 --> 00:28.000
With burial records,

00:28.100 --> 00:30.800
identification should be
pretty straightforward.

00:30.800 --> 00:32.500
All right, let's see.

00:32.600 --> 00:33.800
Female...

00:33.900 --> 00:35.600
40 to 50 years old,

00:35.800 --> 00:37.700
severe osteoporosis,

00:37.800 --> 00:41.700
dress and jewelry place burial
around the late 19th century.

00:43.200 --> 00:44.500
This one's in pieces.

00:46.000 --> 00:47.000
What's going on here?

00:47.400 --> 00:49.000
Lorraine said you're
giving them church records.

00:49.100 --> 00:51.400
The burial records, Father,
so they can identify

00:51.500 --> 00:53.000
and reinter the remains.

00:53.100 --> 00:56.000
Those records are
my responsibility,
Father Sands.

00:56.100 --> 00:58.200
You're to go through me before
allowing their release.

00:58.300 --> 01:00.200
I'm sorry, Father.
I saw no harm in it.

01:00.300 --> 01:01.800
I still run this parish.

01:01.900 --> 01:02.900
I understand.

01:03.300 --> 01:04.599
I'm Father William Donlan.

01:04.700 --> 01:06.700
This is Dr. Brennan
from the Jeffersonian and...

01:06.800 --> 01:08.300
They can't speak
for themselves?

01:08.900 --> 01:10.100
I'm Dr. Addy.

01:10.400 --> 01:11.400
Are you one
of those priests

01:11.500 --> 01:13.300
who smacks schoolchildren
with rulers?

01:14.500 --> 01:16.400
That's not allowed anymore.

01:16.700 --> 01:18.900
We do need those
burial records, Father.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.300
And since this is a federally
protected historic site--

01:21.400 --> 01:22.800
Fine.
But I'll

01:22.900 --> 01:24.800
to show some respect
for where you are.

01:24.900 --> 01:26.400
This is
consecrated ground.

01:26.500 --> 01:28.300
When did you say the last person
was buried here?

01:28.400 --> 01:29.800
1951.

01:29.900 --> 01:31.000
This is a male,

01:31.100 --> 01:33.900
buried no more than five
years ago without a casket.

01:34.000 --> 01:35.000
That's impossible.

01:35.100 --> 01:37.300
There's evidence of trauma
to the frontal bone.

01:37.400 --> 01:38.800
Looks like a fatal assault.

01:38.900 --> 01:40.300
Arrange for a
forensic team.

01:40.400 --> 01:41.900
Hodgins will want
to collect soil

01:42.000 --> 01:43.700
for bugs and particulates.
I'll call Booth.

01:44.300 --> 01:46.400
I'm afraid your ground
was consecrated

01:46.400 --> 01:48.400
as a crime scene, Father.

01:51.500 --> 01:53.700
You know, the priest
made a complaint.pl

01:53.900 --> 01:55.600
He said that you made fun

01:55.700 --> 01:57.700
of consecrated grounds?
No, I didn't.

01:57.800 --> 01:59.700
Perhaps I was
a bit colorful.
Colorful?

01:59.900 --> 02:00.800
Writerly.

02:00.900 --> 02:02.300
I am a best-selling author,
Booth.

02:02.400 --> 02:04.100
Victim is 30 to 40 years old.

02:04.200 --> 02:05.700
He's an old school priest,
Bones.

02:05.800 --> 02:07.300
So I'm supposed to walk
on eggshells

02:07.400 --> 02:09.199
because someone believes
that a plot  earth

02:09.300 --> 02:10.800
has supernatural properties

02:10.800 --> 02:12.400
because they waved
a wand over it?

02:12.500 --> 02:14.300
There's no wand.
The church doesn't use wands.

02:14.400 --> 02:16.800
Fine. Magic water.
Magic...

02:16.800 --> 02:17.700
Holy water.

02:17.800 --> 02:19.300
The terminology makes it real?

02:19.400 --> 02:21.100
Okay, you know, I can't work
with you on this case.

02:21.200 --> 02:21.900
What do you mean?

02:22.000 --> 02:23.600
The victim
was clearly murdered.

02:23.700 --> 02:24.900
We investigate murders--

02:25.100 --> 02:26.800
together.
There's evidence of
blood pooling

02:26.900 --> 02:29.000
on the frontal bone,
and an absence of

02:29.100 --> 02:30.100
concentric fractures.

02:30.300 --> 02:31.600
That requires investigation.

02:31.800 --> 02:32.900
I'm not working
a whole case

02:33.000 --> 02:34.100
with you attacking my beliefs.

02:34.200 --> 02:35.600
You should've just sailed
off with your boyfriend.

02:35.700 --> 02:38.000
Funny. A man who believes
in an invisible super-being

02:38.100 --> 02:39.700
wants to run my
personal life.

02:39.800 --> 02:41.400
Death would have followed
quickly, caused by

02:41.500 --> 02:43.100
craniocerebral trauma.
By the way,

02:43.200 --> 02:45.300
90% of the world
believes in God.

02:45.400 --> 02:47.300
And, at one time, most
people were certain

02:47.400 --> 02:48.800
that the sun revolved
around the earth.

02:48.900 --> 02:49.500
You see what I mean?

02:49.600 --> 02:51.200
I don't think that this
is about religion at all.

02:51.300 --> 02:53.000
We obviously have issues, oksu,

02:53.300 --> 02:55.700
that are affecting
our working relationship.

02:55.700 --> 02:56.700
And you're afraid
to deal with them,

02:56.800 --> 02:58.400
so you just lash out
at my religion.

02:58.500 --> 02:59.700
Can't you just be satisfied

02:59.800 --> 03:01.400
that if I'm wrong about God,
I'll burn in hell?

03:01.500 --> 03:02.200
That's tempting.

03:02.300 --> 03:04.400
Good. Now how about
we get back to work.

03:04.500 --> 03:05.200
You know, I think
we both still want

03:05.300 --> 03:06.700
to find out who
killed this man.

03:08.900 --> 03:13.100
---www.opensubtitles.org---

03:13.200 --> 03:16.200
 Bones.S02E17.HDTV.XviD-LOL

03:16.300 --> 03:20.400
217 - The Priest in the Churchyard

03:43.600 --> 03:46.800
The shovel was found a few feet
from where the water main burst,

03:47.000 --> 03:49.100
buried in a colony of worms.
And they say

03:49.400 --> 03:51.100
Christmas only comes once
a year.

03:51.200 --> 03:53.000
The metal shavings here
 match the shovel.

03:53.100 --> 03:54.600
Someone was digging
in the cemetery,

03:54.700 --> 03:56.600
broke the water main,
resurrecting the dead.

03:56.700 --> 03:59.300
And why was someone
digging up the cemetery

03:59.400 --> 04:00.200
at 3:00 in the morning?

04:00.300 --> 04:01.800
Maybe he came back
to dig up the victim?

04:01.900 --> 04:03.200
Move him to another location.

04:03.300 --> 04:05.300
Yeah, or bury someone else.

04:05.900 --> 04:06.700
Dark.

04:06.800 --> 04:08.700
Yeah, and this place
is always so sunny.

04:09.700 --> 04:10.800
Here's our victim.

04:11.400 --> 04:13.200
Found casings from
eastern tent caterpillars

04:13.300 --> 04:16.100
in his eye sockets--
means he was buried
about three years ago.

04:16.800 --> 04:18.200
He has kind eyes.

04:18.399 --> 04:19.800
How do you know
he had kind eyes?

04:21.000 --> 04:21.700
I had to make a choice,

04:21.800 --> 04:24.800
so I chose kind.
And you wonder why I love you.

04:24.900 --> 04:26.600
Is she not fantastic?

04:27.800 --> 04:30.200
You aren't seriously asking me
to be a part of this.

04:30.900 --> 04:32.300
Get your rendering
over to Booth

04:32.400 --> 04:33.400
so they can show the priests.

04:33.500 --> 04:35.900
I am going to go resaturate
the dried blood,

04:36.000 --> 04:37.400
see if it's of any value.

04:40.200 --> 04:41.100
Murder?

04:41.800 --> 04:43.600
I don't believe
it was murder.

04:43.700 --> 04:45.300
It's not a matter of faith,
Father.

04:45.300 --> 04:47.100
The injuries are definitive.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.200
You ever hear of the sin
of pride, young woman?

04:50.300 --> 04:51.400
You could be wrong.

04:51.500 --> 04:53.500
Dr. Brennan here, she's
the best in her field.

04:53.800 --> 04:56.700
He would have been buried
about three years ago.

04:56.800 --> 04:58.600
I've been here for 41 years,

04:58.800 --> 05:00.700
I would know if
someone had killed

05:00.800 --> 05:02.800
and buried a man
in my cemetery.

05:02.900 --> 05:04.900
You seem quite proud yourself.

05:06.200 --> 05:07.300
I don't need to be insulted.

05:07.400 --> 05:08.400
Knock it off.

05:08.400 --> 05:10.100
What?
The rules don't apply to him?

05:11.200 --> 05:12.200
Have you offered your guests

05:12.300 --> 05:13.900
any tea or
snacks, Father?

05:14.200 --> 05:15.300
Isn't that why
you're here?

05:16.200 --> 05:17.300
I see someone wants his roast

05:17.400 --> 05:19.100
dry and
overcooked tonight.

05:19.200 --> 05:22.100
Hi, I'm Lorraine.
I'm the parish administrator.

05:22.300 --> 05:24.300
I have some
refreshments inside.

05:24.400 --> 05:26.500
And Father Matt is there,
if you need to talk to him.

05:26.600 --> 05:28.200
Nicknames for priests.

05:28.400 --> 05:29.100
Last Sunday,

05:29.200 --> 05:32.600
he had the whole congregation
holding hands.

05:32.700 --> 05:34.600
No wonder there's
no respect anymore.

05:34.700 --> 05:35.700
Would you mind
just taking a look

05:35.800 --> 05:37.300
at this sketch
we have here, please?

05:38.500 --> 05:40.200
So, do you, uh,
recognize him?

05:40.400 --> 05:42.000
No... no, I do not.

05:42.100 --> 05:43.200
You're sure?

05:43.400 --> 05:44.700
I'm not senile.

05:45.500 --> 05:47.400
I can name every child
I baptized,

05:47.500 --> 05:49.200
every person I gave
the last rites to,

05:49.300 --> 05:52.100
every plant on these
grounds-- over 200.

05:52.300 --> 05:53.100
That's aconite.

05:53.300 --> 05:55.100
And this is
 <i>Origanum vulgare,</i>

05:55.200 --> 05:56.700
and over there
are yew trees.

05:56.800 --> 05:58.300
You know, it was the
Druids who first thought

05:58.400 --> 05:59.400
of the yew tree as sacred.

05:59.400 --> 06:01.000
The Christians
adopted the belief,

06:01.100 --> 06:02.100
claiming it as their own.

06:02.200 --> 06:04.900
Stop...

06:05.000 --> 06:06.100
If there's nothing else,

06:06.400 --> 06:08.100
I'd like to finish pruning.

06:08.600 --> 06:11.100
You go have tea with
the hippie priest.

06:13.200 --> 06:14.400
<i>I've been here three years.</i>

06:14.500 --> 06:16.200
The archdiocese was thinking of
closing the parish;

06:16.300 --> 06:18.200
sent me here to try and breath
some life into it.

06:18.300 --> 06:20.200
I started a sports
program for the boys,

06:20.300 --> 06:21.700
organized singles' dances.

06:21.800 --> 06:24.300
None of this is easy
for Father Donlan to accept.

06:24.500 --> 06:26.400
So you don't believe
in all the...

06:26.500 --> 06:28.200
supernatural mythology he does.

06:28.700 --> 06:31.400
Well, if you're talking
about the Holy Trinity,
the transubstantiation

06:31.500 --> 06:34.100
of the host, and the
resurrection...I certainly do.

06:34.200 --> 06:36.100
But you seem like such
an intelligent man.

06:36.200 --> 06:37.700
You have to excuse her, Father.

06:37.800 --> 06:41.200
No need-- God has a soft spot,
even for the atheists.

06:41.600 --> 06:43.600
I'm telling you,
this is fantastic.

06:43.800 --> 06:44.300
What is it?

06:44.400 --> 06:46.400
She's trying to concentrate,
Booth.

06:46.500 --> 06:48.500
It's an orange-berry pound cake.

06:48.800 --> 06:49.400
I'm sorry.

06:49.500 --> 06:51.000
I don't think
I recognize him.

06:51.200 --> 06:52.600
???

06:53.000 --> 06:54.000
Uh, I've been here...

06:54.100 --> 06:55.800
23 years next month.

06:56.100 --> 06:58.800
My mother died when I was 12;
the parish took me in.

06:58.800 --> 07:01.100
I've been the administrator
for seven years now.

07:01.200 --> 07:03.000
Father Donlan basically
raised Lorraine.

07:03.400 --> 07:05.800
Hey, um... you're not going to
eat that, are you, Father?

07:06.100 --> 07:09.100
No, it's okay, my stomach hasn't
been too fond of me lately.

07:09.200 --> 07:11.200
Then let's get out of your way.

07:12.100 --> 07:13.100
Perhaps a nap

07:13.200 --> 07:14.400
wouldn't be a bad idea.

07:14.500 --> 07:16.100
Is there anyone
else that we can

07:16.200 --> 07:17.700
show the sketch to?
Why don't you bring it

07:17.800 --> 07:19.500
to mass on Sunday--
we could pass it around.

07:19.600 --> 07:20.700
Some of the parishioners

07:20.900 --> 07:22.700
have been there a long time;
you might have some luck.

07:22.800 --> 07:24.100
Are you sure?
Agent Booth,

07:24.200 --> 07:25.600
I'm trying to build
a community here.

07:25.700 --> 07:27.000
If we can't work
together to help

07:27.000 --> 07:30.000
solve a crime like this,
then I'm not doing my job.

07:32.700 --> 07:35.200
<i>It doesn't help the case for</i>
 <i>you to insult the priests.</i>

07:35.300 --> 07:37.600
We're supposed to be gaining
their trust, so they'll help us.

07:37.700 --> 07:39.300
Matt wasn't threatened;
you were.

07:39.400 --> 07:41.400
We're definitely not working
well together.

07:41.400 --> 07:43.200
Because you are bossy
and judgmental.

07:43.300 --> 07:45.300
Problems between people,

07:45.300 --> 07:47.300
it's never just
one person's fault.

07:47.400 --> 07:49.800
What about Hitler?
He did pretty well on his own.

07:51.600 --> 07:52.600
Bones, just...

07:54.000 --> 07:55.600
come with me to go see
Dr. Wyatt.

07:55.600 --> 07:56.700
Just once.

07:57.600 --> 08:00.600
No! Therapy is a vague
and inexact process.

08:00.700 --> 08:02.300
The man shouldn't even
be called a doctor.

08:02.400 --> 08:03.700
Well, he helped me.

08:03.900 --> 08:06.400
I mean, are you so threatened
that, uh...

08:06.800 --> 08:08.700
you can't even do a favor
for someone

08:08.800 --> 08:09.800
that you call a friend?

08:12.400 --> 08:14.400
I will speak my mind, Booth.

08:14.500 --> 08:19.400
I will speak my mind.
Okay.

08:21.600 --> 08:23.200
It's 7:30, Hodgins.

08:23.400 --> 08:26.000
Well, maybe the same shovel
was used as the murder weapon.

08:26.900 --> 08:30.000
The metal residue on the skull
is some sort of silver alloy.

08:30.100 --> 08:32.200
You said you were gonna
be finished in a minute.

08:32.600 --> 08:33.900
That was an hour ago.

08:34.000 --> 08:36.900
If I can narrow down the
smelting process of the silver,

08:37.600 --> 08:38.100
I might be able
to figure out

08:38.200 --> 08:40.100
what kind of weapon
we're looking for.

08:40.700 --> 08:43.299
I love it when you
talk about smelting.

08:43.600 --> 08:44.300
Oh, yeah?

08:44.600 --> 08:45.400
Mmm-hmm.

08:50.600 --> 08:51.600
Move in with me.

08:52.800 --> 08:53.600
What?

08:53.700 --> 08:56.200
We already live together;
just... just move in.

08:57.700 --> 08:58.900
No, we don't.

08:59.300 --> 09:00.700
You've taken over my closet.

09:01.700 --> 09:02.900
It's over half-full.

09:03.500 --> 09:04.500
And over half...

09:04.600 --> 09:07.500
is the common law definition
of living together.

09:08.800 --> 09:11.300
I have my own place, Jack.

09:12.600 --> 09:14.000
I need my place.

09:14.600 --> 09:15.600
I need you.

09:17.000 --> 09:23.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
Do I have to throw
cold water on you two?

09:26.800 --> 09:28.000
We were, um, just...

09:28.100 --> 09:30.200
I know. Just try and keep
it off the Internet, okay?

09:30.700 --> 09:32.300
So, I have bad news.

09:32.400 --> 09:34.700
We've all been exposed to
coccidioidomycosis.

09:34.800 --> 09:35.800
A fungal infection

09:35.900 --> 09:37.600
from the graveyard dirt
we've been breathing.

09:37.800 --> 09:39.600
Symptoms include nausea,

09:39.700 --> 09:42.000
weakness, fever...
I feel fine.

09:42.100 --> 09:42.600
Yeah, me too.

09:42.700 --> 09:44.000
...decreased libido.

09:44.200 --> 09:45.300
I'm listening.

09:46.200 --> 09:47.300
We're all gonna get shots.

09:47.400 --> 09:49.400
Yeah, that sounds good.
Very good. Yeah.

09:49.800 --> 09:50.600
Thought so.

09:53.400 --> 09:55.600
She refers to God
as my invisible friend.

09:55.700 --> 09:57.700
You're talking to
somebody who isn't there.
I'm sure the doctor

09:57.800 --> 09:59.500
questions your
little fantasy.

09:59.600 --> 10:02.500
My beliefs aren't at issue here,
Dr. Brennan.

10:02.600 --> 10:05.600
Clearly, she's intolerant
and it's affecting her
working relationship.

10:05.600 --> 10:07.300
Yes, he's very
difficult to work with.

10:07.300 --> 10:09.800
Booth said that you could
fix this.

10:10.000 --> 10:10.900
So...?

10:14.000 --> 10:16.600
"What now is proved
was once only imagined.

10:17.000 --> 10:17.800
"The rat, the mouse,

10:17.900 --> 10:20.100
"the fox, the rabbit--
watch the roots--

10:20.500 --> 10:23.100
"the lion the tiger,
the horse, the elephant--

10:24.000 --> 10:25.200
"watch the fruits.

10:25.600 --> 10:26.900
"The cistern contains,

10:27.400 --> 10:31.000
the fountain... overflows."

10:32.400 --> 10:33.300
What?

10:33.300 --> 10:34.500
Oh, come now.
Surely you get the reference.

10:34.600 --> 10:35.900
William Blake.

10:35.900 --> 10:38.000
Yes. Blake is telling us
that we are all at the mercy

10:38.100 --> 10:39.700
of our fundamental natures.

10:39.700 --> 10:42.000
Which is nonsense,
of course, but...

10:42.000 --> 10:44.100
when we understand our natures,

10:44.400 --> 10:46.600
we understand the
resulting conflicts.

10:47.200 --> 10:47.600
What?

10:47.700 --> 10:48.700
I hate psychology.

10:48.800 --> 10:49.400
As do I!

10:49.500 --> 10:51.500
It applies a patina of science

10:51.600 --> 10:54.000
over what is essentially
a dark and complex

10:54.100 --> 10:57.200
set of roiling unknowables.

10:57.600 --> 10:59.700
You see? What?

11:00.100 --> 11:01.900
You weren't fighting
about religion.

11:02.200 --> 11:03.800
But, that's what Booth said.

11:04.300 --> 11:07.600
Religion provided
the flash point you needed

11:07.900 --> 11:10.100
to expose an
underlying issue.

11:10.200 --> 11:12.200
I will find out
what that issue is,

11:12.200 --> 11:14.400
help you to resolve it,

11:14.600 --> 11:16.500
and set right the balance

11:16.600 --> 11:19.200
of dark and light
in the universe.

11:19.400 --> 11:20.900
Isn't he great?

11:25.600 --> 11:26.900
O God,
the Creator and Preserver

11:27.000 --> 11:29.700
of all mankind, we humbly
beseech Thee for all...

11:29.700 --> 11:30.700
Well, shouldn't Brennan

11:30.700 --> 11:32.200
be here with you...
Shh.

11:32.300 --> 11:34.000
...instead of me?

11:34.100 --> 11:38.000
We're dealing
with a few work issues.

11:38.100 --> 11:39.500
Trouble in paradise?

11:41.100 --> 11:43.800
We're just spending
some time apart.

11:44.200 --> 11:46.900
Now if you don't mind,
I'd like to pray.

11:47.000 --> 11:48.300
Thank you.

11:50.100 --> 11:51.600
Did you two
sleep together?

11:52.000 --> 11:53.000
Do you see

11:53.200 --> 11:53.800
where we are?

11:53.900 --> 11:56.300
You don't talk
like that in church.

11:58.400 --> 12:00.900
What does that lab do
to you people?

12:01.500 --> 12:02.400
It's just...

12:03.400 --> 12:05.900
this feels like
a couples thing,

12:06.400 --> 12:08.200
and now that
Sully is gone...

12:08.300 --> 12:09.500
It's not.

12:10.000 --> 12:11.200
It's a work thing.

12:13.700 --> 12:15.700
And so is us being here,
so stay focused.

12:15.200 --> 12:18.100
We ask all these things
through Christ our Lord.

12:18.800 --> 12:19.800
Amen.

12:20.100 --> 12:24.500
I have a unusual request
before I dismiss you today.

12:24.100 --> 12:27.000
We have Special Agent Booth
and Ms. Montenegro

12:27.100 --> 12:28.300
from the Jeffersonian with us,

12:28.400 --> 12:30.600
and they need our help
identifying the victim found

12:30.700 --> 12:32.300
in our cemetery. Now,

12:32.400 --> 12:36.400
I know none of us want to get
involved in something so ugly,

12:36.500 --> 12:38.400
but as Jesus said,
"Whatever you do

12:38.500 --> 12:40.400
for the least
of these brothers of mine,

12:40.700 --> 12:42.600
you do for me," so please,

12:42.900 --> 12:44.300
if you recognize the sketch,

12:44.400 --> 12:45.100
let them know.

12:45.700 --> 12:46.800
How about you, Enzo?

12:47.300 --> 12:48.400
Enzo never misses Mass.

12:48.500 --> 12:49.400
Right, Enzo?

12:49.700 --> 12:50.500
Sorry, Father,

12:50.600 --> 12:51.500
I can't help you.

12:51.800 --> 12:53.400
Um, excuse me.

12:54.800 --> 12:57.300
Could you give him a beard?

12:57.400 --> 12:59.300
Make him heavier?

12:59.400 --> 13:00.000
Yeah,

13:00.200 --> 13:01.400
I can manage that.

13:01.900 --> 13:04.300
James was an altar boy here
when he was younger.

13:07.700 --> 13:08.400
Um...

13:10.000 --> 13:11.200
I, I think...

13:13.000 --> 13:15.300
Does this look like
Father McCourt to anyone else?

13:17.700 --> 13:19.000
Yeah, that could be him.

13:19.200 --> 13:20.800
Someone killed a priest?

13:22.100 --> 13:23.200
Thank you, James.

13:25.200 --> 13:27.200
Father McCourt was
here before me.

13:27.400 --> 13:28.800
I replaced him
three years ago.

13:28.900 --> 13:30.800
I was told
he left the priesthood.

13:35.200 --> 13:38.600
Well, I suppose it might
resemble Father McCourt.

13:38.400 --> 13:40.600
So much for that
sharp memory.

13:40.900 --> 13:42.800
Father McCourt wasn't
here for long.

13:43.200 --> 13:44.300
And the eyes are wrong.

13:44.400 --> 13:46.100
That's how you recognize
someone.

13:46.200 --> 13:49.100
Father McCourt's eyes were
hollow, cold.

13:49.300 --> 13:50.600
I take it
you two didn't get along.

13:50.700 --> 13:53.500
I was his confessor.
You know I can't say anything.

13:54.800 --> 13:56.200
Can <i>you</i> tell me anything?

13:57.400 --> 14:00.100
Just... he was
very secretive.

14:00.600 --> 14:02.100
He'd disappear
for hours at a time.

14:02.200 --> 14:04.000
Some nights he wouldn't even
come back to the rectory.

14:04.300 --> 14:05.400
One day he was gone.

14:05.800 --> 14:07.800
Left a note saying
he was leaving the priesthood.

14:09.700 --> 14:10.600
All right, thanks.

14:11.000 --> 14:13.300
I've identified
some odd postmortem injuries

14:13.400 --> 14:14.500
on the old bodies.

14:14.600 --> 14:16.900
Snapped fingers,
fractured wrists,

14:17.400 --> 14:19.400
abrasions on the
ligamenta flava.

14:19.500 --> 14:21.900
And I found traces of gold
in some of the fractures.

14:22.400 --> 14:23.100
I don't get it.

14:23.200 --> 14:25.200
The person who ruptured
the water main that night

14:25.300 --> 14:26.700
was a grave robber.

14:26.800 --> 14:29.600
Dr. Brennan told me she saw
injuries like this in Tibet:

14:29.800 --> 14:32.000
broken bones and
bone markings

14:32.100 --> 14:34.500
from yanking jewelry and
valuables off the remains.

14:34.600 --> 14:37.100
Yeah, which means McCourt
cotd have been struck

14:37.200 --> 14:39.500
by a shovel, but also
he could have been struck

14:39.600 --> 14:41.600
by one of the valuables
the grave robber found.

14:41.900 --> 14:45.100
So our grave robber comes
to a nice, quiet graveyard,

14:45.200 --> 14:46.600
next to a nice,
quiet church

14:46.900 --> 14:48.500
whenever he's in need
of some extra cash.

14:48.600 --> 14:50.800
Only to be surprised one night
by Father McCourt,

14:51.200 --> 14:53.100
???

15:01.000 --> 15:02.700
During the 19th century,
it was customary

15:02.800 --> 15:04.800
Wu yduntiviudto photograph the
txese0two0puople:before burya?

15:04.800 --> 15:06.900
???

15:07.000 --> 15:09.800
Gertrude Watters,
died 1873,

15:09.900 --> 15:12.700
and Horace Rutledge,
died 1901.

15:13.000 --> 15:14.200
And their valuables
were missing?

15:14.500 --> 15:17.400
Yes. Dr. Hodgins believes
the grave robber is working

15:17.500 --> 15:20.100
in sections, focusing
on the oldest first

15:20.200 --> 15:22.400
where the artifacts
would have the most value.

15:22.700 --> 15:23.600
Who takes care

15:23.700 --> 15:24.500
of the cemetery?

15:24.600 --> 15:27.400
Uh, a landscaper? Janitor?

15:27.500 --> 15:29.000
Father Donlan does
all the gardening.

15:29.100 --> 15:30.800
It's, you know,
sort of his obsession.

15:30.900 --> 15:33.100
Other than that, the
occasional parishioner

15:33.200 --> 15:35.700
will rake leaves
or, uh, shovel snow.

15:37.500 --> 15:38.000
You all right?

15:39.700 --> 15:42.100
You know,
I can't quite shake this bug.

15:43.500 --> 15:44.100
And I've got

15:44.200 --> 15:45.500
a wrestling team to coach.

15:46.200 --> 15:46.900
Um, do you mind?

15:48.800 --> 15:51.700
You were in close proximity
with remains.

15:51.800 --> 15:53.800
You were probably exposed
to a fungal infection.

15:53.900 --> 15:54.900
What? Is... is that bad?

15:55.000 --> 15:55.700
No.
Yeah.

15:57.000 --> 15:58.400
It's nothing to worry about.

15:58.500 --> 16:00.200
I'll have my office arrange
for treatment.

16:00.300 --> 16:01.200
Thank you.

16:03.700 --> 16:05.300
???

16:05.400 --> 16:08.400
FBI is trying to track
the jewelry to
pawnshops and fences.

16:09.100 --> 16:10.700
I'm checking online
auction sites.

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
This stuff could net
a fortune.

16:13.300 --> 16:14.400
Enough to kill a priest?

16:14.500 --> 16:15.500
Apparently.

16:16.400 --> 16:18.400
Hey, have you noticed
anything going on between

16:18.600 --> 16:19.800
Brennan and Booth?

16:20.700 --> 16:21.700
This sounds good.

16:21.800 --> 16:23.100
There is tension.

16:23.700 --> 16:26.500
Ever since Brennan
let Sully sail off

16:26.700 --> 16:28.000
into the sunset
without her.

16:28.200 --> 16:29.300
No, I didn't notice.

16:29.600 --> 16:31.200
Hmm.
But then again,
I didn't notice

16:31.300 --> 16:32.600
that you didn't want
to live with me either.

16:32.700 --> 16:33.200
Hodgins.

16:33.300 --> 16:34.500
If you're getting
cold feet...

16:34.600 --> 16:36.900
You're the only one
that would feel them.

16:37.600 --> 16:38.400
Angela.

16:38.500 --> 16:39.800
We'll discuss it at lunch.

16:40.500 --> 16:41.600
The Egyptian place?

16:41.900 --> 16:42.500
Mm-hmm.

16:42.600 --> 16:44.200
Just got off the phone
with the CDC.

16:44.600 --> 16:46.900
The fungal infection we were
exposed to from the graveyard

16:47.000 --> 16:48.300
is rare enough
that they'd have records

16:48.400 --> 16:50.300
of anyone
who was infected, but

16:50.400 --> 16:51.900
I need your samples
for the strain.

16:52.000 --> 16:53.600
You got it.
 <i>Yeah.</i>

16:53.700 --> 16:55.900
You know, I got no problem
with this place.

16:56.800 --> 16:59.500
It's where, uh, Bones and
the squints get their answers.

16:59.600 --> 17:00.300
See?

17:00.600 --> 17:02.000
Thumbs in the belt.

17:02.100 --> 17:03.800
That's a very
aggressive stance,

17:03.900 --> 17:05.300
very male.

17:08.200 --> 17:10.300
Crossed arms...
defensive.

17:12.500 --> 17:13.300
Disdain.

17:13.400 --> 17:15.500
But let's not worry about
what you do with your hands.

17:16.000 --> 17:20.000
What you must do is recognize
your negative feelings

17:20.099 --> 17:22.599
for what is, after all,
Dr. Brennan's domain

17:22.700 --> 17:24.300
and verbalize them.

17:24.500 --> 17:26.599
Verbalize them.
What, now?

17:27.800 --> 17:30.900
This place is too, uh...
it's too shiny,

17:31.600 --> 17:32.500
you know, too bright.

17:33.200 --> 17:34.000
It's clean.

17:34.300 --> 17:35.400
And clean is bad?

17:35.500 --> 17:37.200
Death isn't clean,

17:37.300 --> 17:39.500
especially murder, which is
our business, all right?

17:39.600 --> 17:41.600
This place is completely fake.

17:41.700 --> 17:42.800
It's bogus.

17:42.900 --> 17:45.200
You'd like to destroy
the entire edifice.

17:45.300 --> 17:48.000
Oh, I'd like to rip
the whole edifice down

17:48.100 --> 17:50.000
with my bare hands,
or set it on fire

17:50.100 --> 17:51.700
except, you know, there's
nothing in this place to burn.

17:51.800 --> 17:53.800
All the plastic and the metal
and the flashing lights,

17:53.900 --> 17:54.800
you know, and arithmetic.

17:54.900 --> 17:55.900
I mean, where's a guy--

17:56.000 --> 17:57.300
a normal guy
who believes

17:57.400 --> 18:00.100
in intuition and the soul
and good and evil...

18:00.300 --> 18:01.900
And God?
Yes, and God, too.
Where is a guy

18:02.000 --> 18:03.900
who doesn't believe in all this
arithmetic supposed to stand?

18:04.300 --> 18:07.200
So your problem with Dr.
Brennan is that you don't know

18:07.300 --> 18:10.700
what will or will not catch
fire or where you stand.

18:13.700 --> 18:15.200
What?
That's good.

18:15.800 --> 18:18.300
You know, that's,
that's very good.

18:23.800 --> 18:27.000
The CDC shows that you
contracted coccidioidomycosis

18:27.100 --> 18:28.200
three years ago.

18:28.500 --> 18:30.000
The only case
in the area.

18:30.500 --> 18:33.100
Well, you know, I,
I, I used to do a lot

18:33.200 --> 18:34.700
of odd jobs
around the parish.

18:35.400 --> 18:36.900
I'd help Father
Donlan in the garden.

18:37.000 --> 18:38.500
I'm sure that's how
I contracted it.

18:38.600 --> 18:40.700
Nice try, Enzo,
but your name also came up

18:40.800 --> 18:43.000
on the auction site
that was selling jewelry

18:43.400 --> 18:45.800
from the graves.
Which you might have gotten
away with if you hadn't hit

18:45.900 --> 18:46.800
the water main.

18:48.600 --> 18:49.600
I want a lawyer.

18:49.700 --> 18:50.600
Yeah, nice way to get him

18:50.700 --> 18:51.400
to clam up,
thanks.

18:54.100 --> 18:55.500
So why'd you kill
Father McCourt?

18:55.600 --> 18:57.100
Did he catch you?
I didn't kill anybody.

18:57.300 --> 18:59.600
Ah, there you go.
He's talking again.
What the hell is

18:59.700 --> 19:01.700
wrong with you people?
You think that I'd
kill a priest?

19:01.800 --> 19:03.300
Your record also shows
that you were assigned

19:03.400 --> 19:05.600
to court-appointed
drug counseling.

19:06.800 --> 19:08.500
Okay, look, I had
a drug problem

19:08.600 --> 19:09.900
and, and I needed money.

19:10.000 --> 19:11.600
I saw these pictures
in the rectory.

19:12.000 --> 19:13.300
Jewelry just buried.

19:13.400 --> 19:14.100
You know.

19:16.100 --> 19:17.500
I figured no one
would miss it.

19:19.200 --> 19:21.300
I didn't kill anybody, okay?

19:22.500 --> 19:24.800
Father McCourt and me, we
never had that problem.

19:25.300 --> 19:27.500
I wasn't his type--
too old.

19:28.400 --> 19:30.300
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

19:30.800 --> 19:33.000
I'm pretty sure it's
an implication of pedophilia.

19:33.200 --> 19:35.000
I know, Bones, okay...
But you just said...

19:35.600 --> 19:36.500
Who, Enzo?

19:36.600 --> 19:37.700
Who was his type?

19:39.700 --> 19:40.800
Talk to James, okay?

19:41.200 --> 19:42.400
The kid who I.D.'d him.

20:05.500 --> 20:07.700
Is this really
Cleopatra's bed?

20:07.800 --> 20:10.400
Mm, it's a perfect replica
for the new exhibit.

20:10.500 --> 20:12.100
We're just making it a
little bit more authentic.

20:15.600 --> 20:17.000
Your feet aren't
cold anymore.

20:18.000 --> 20:19.000
Nice try.

20:19.400 --> 20:21.200
Hey, I thought I
was successful,

20:21.300 --> 20:22.700
but if you want me
to try harder...

20:30.400 --> 20:32.000
We can't keep our hands
off each other.

20:32.700 --> 20:34.200
I think about you
all the time.

20:35.200 --> 20:37.300
Moving in is
the next logical step.

20:39.200 --> 20:40.200
I have a lease.

20:42.000 --> 20:43.400
I have an estate.

20:43.500 --> 20:44.800
I'll buy out your lease.

20:46.200 --> 20:47.000
Shh...

20:47.300 --> 20:48.700
We only have 15
more minutes.

20:49.000 --> 20:49.800
You said
that we would talk.

20:49.900 --> 20:50.900
Yeah, well,
guess what?

20:51.000 --> 20:51.400
Hmm?

20:52.100 --> 20:53.300
I got distracted.

21:05.100 --> 21:07.000
I can't believe
Father McCourt's dead.

21:09.100 --> 21:11.300
I mean, I, I thought
he just took off.

21:12.000 --> 21:13.400
You two were pretty close.

21:13.700 --> 21:14.400
Yeah.

21:15.200 --> 21:16.700
I w-- I was an altar boy.

21:16.800 --> 21:17.800
Yeah, so was I.

21:18.500 --> 21:21.200
I liked our priest,
too, but, um...

21:22.000 --> 21:22.700
What?

21:24.300 --> 21:26.600
You think what everyone
else does, don't you?

21:27.000 --> 21:29.200
I don't know; what does
everybody else think?

21:32.100 --> 21:34.400
Because we spent so much
time together, he was...

21:36.500 --> 21:39.000
touching me and stuff.

21:39.100 --> 21:39.900
Really?

21:40.100 --> 21:44.400
Because, you know, if he did
and you got mad one day and...

21:44.500 --> 21:45.400
And killed him?

21:47.200 --> 21:49.100
You think I killed
Father McCourt?

21:50.200 --> 21:52.300
He never touched
me, not once.

21:53.300 --> 21:54.700
He was my best friend.

21:55.200 --> 21:57.500
My dad bailed on us
when I was three.

21:58.000 --> 21:59.800
Father McCourt came to
my ball games, he yelled

21:59.900 --> 22:00.800
at me about my grades.

22:00.900 --> 22:02.800
He was the only one
who actually cared.

22:02.800 --> 22:03.900
It doesn't matter
what you think.

22:04.000 --> 22:05.800
Father Donlan didn't
even believe me.

22:06.000 --> 22:06.800
Father Donlan?

22:08.000 --> 22:08.700
Yeah.

22:10.200 --> 22:12.400
About a month before
Father McCourt disappeared,

22:12.500 --> 22:13.900
Father Donlan
came to my house

22:14.400 --> 22:16.100
and said he knew what Father
McCourt was doing to me.

22:16.300 --> 22:17.300
He wouldn't listen.

22:17.500 --> 22:20.700
He was screaming
that Father McCourt

22:20.800 --> 22:22.400
was going to pay
for his sins.

22:22.800 --> 22:24.500
I'm telling you,
it was scary.

22:24.900 --> 22:26.600
That old priest was crazy.

22:27.500 --> 22:29.000
???

22:32.400 --> 22:34.300
???

22:34.700 --> 22:37.400
I'm strict with all the priests
who are assigned to my parish.

22:39.200 --> 22:41.200
How strict, Father?

22:42.000 --> 22:44.500
I'm not a New Age priest
like Father Matt.

22:45.100 --> 22:48.500
The Church should be
firm and act as an immovable

22:48.600 --> 22:50.600
bulwark in the face of change.

22:50.700 --> 22:52.600
Actually,
organized belief systems

22:52.700 --> 22:54.600
which fail to adapt
to changing mores

22:54.700 --> 22:56.300
are demoted
from religions

22:56.400 --> 22:59.100
to acknowledged
metaphoric myth systems.

22:59.200 --> 23:01.600
I mean, no one
worships Odin anymore

23:01.700 --> 23:02.600
or Zeus.

23:08.100 --> 23:09.800
Thanks, Bones, I can
take it from here.

23:10.400 --> 23:11.800
You're kicking me out?
Yes.

23:12.100 --> 23:14.700
All he can think about now
is giving you catechism.
I need him to answer

23:14.800 --> 23:17.300
some questions.
Wyatt's psychology
isn't working.

23:24.900 --> 23:25.700
Father, I

23:25.800 --> 23:28.500
contacted the archdiocese
about St. Agatha's

23:28.600 --> 23:29.200
and they said

23:29.500 --> 23:31.900
quite a few priests
have come and gone

23:32.000 --> 23:32.900
during your tenure.

23:33.600 --> 23:36.300
Given who they send me,
I've done well.

23:36.600 --> 23:37.800
Who do they send you?

23:37.900 --> 23:40.700
Priests who need firm guidance,
for the most part.

23:40.800 --> 23:44.300
In 1997, a complaint was sworn
against you for assault.

23:44.500 --> 23:48.400
Is that your idea
of "firm guidance"?

23:48.500 --> 23:50.600
It was not assault,
it was corporal punishment.

23:50.700 --> 23:52.900
I found an altar boy
drinking sacramental wine

23:53.000 --> 23:54.500
from the chalice.
And you caned him.

23:54.600 --> 23:55.800
The charges were dropped.

23:56.000 --> 23:57.700
I learned my lesson, and I have

23:57.800 --> 23:59.300
never struck anyone since.

24:00.800 --> 24:02.400
Father Donlan, in your opinion,

24:02.500 --> 24:05.700
did Father McCourt pay too much
attention to James LeVay?

24:07.200 --> 24:09.100
You should ask James.
I did.

24:09.400 --> 24:11.600
James told us that
you suspected the worst.

24:12.400 --> 24:14.600
He was frightened
at how angry you were.

24:16.800 --> 24:18.200
I regret scaring him.

24:19.600 --> 24:20.700
???

24:27.200 --> 24:28.900
There are greenstick
fractures

24:29.000 --> 24:30.100
on the victim's left ulna

24:30.200 --> 24:32.300
as well as his fibula
and some ribs.

24:32.600 --> 24:34.500
Probably defensive wounds
received in the struggle.

24:34.600 --> 24:36.000
There's no evidence
of a struggle.

24:36.100 --> 24:37.700
These seem to have
occurred postmortem,

24:37.800 --> 24:39.900
when he was dragged--
probably for burial.

24:40.200 --> 24:41.800
But even getting
dragged over rocks

24:41.900 --> 24:43.400
shouldn't have caused
those fractures.

24:43.500 --> 24:45.400
The matrix of the bone
was weakened.

24:45.800 --> 24:47.100
The cause could be genetic.

24:47.200 --> 24:49.000
Or it could be some chemical

24:49.100 --> 24:50.400
or medicine that compromised
the tissue.

24:50.800 --> 24:52.500
I'll need samples
to run some tox screens.

24:52.600 --> 24:53.300
All right, see these

24:53.400 --> 24:55.000
tiny metallic fragments embedded

24:55.100 --> 24:56.800
in the victim's skull?
It's silver.

24:57.000 --> 24:59.400
Then I'll assume he wasn't
struck by a shovel.

24:59.500 --> 25:02.000
The silver was smelted
using the led reduction method.

25:02.100 --> 25:04.600
The fluxes used indicate
it's from the early 1800s,

25:04.700 --> 25:05.900
probably during
the Napoleonic Wars.

25:06.200 --> 25:08.700
One of our old skeletons
was I.D.'d as a bishop.

25:08.800 --> 25:10.100
Bishop Jursik,

25:10.200 --> 25:11.100
died 1889.

25:11.300 --> 25:12.900
His robes were
worth a fortune.

25:13.000 --> 25:15.100
Let's find out if he was buried
with something silver.

25:15.700 --> 25:18.400
A scepter or a shepherd's crook

25:18.600 --> 25:21.000
or something else suitable
for skull cracking.

25:22.200 --> 25:23.700
Booth kicked me out of here.

25:24.500 --> 25:27.100
For you to say "kicked out"
means that you've acquiesced

25:27.200 --> 25:29.700
to the idea that
this is his domain.

25:31.700 --> 25:33.200
Domain, yes.

25:33.300 --> 25:34.600
He's good at questioning people.

25:34.700 --> 25:37.400
He can... he can tell
when they're lying.

25:37.500 --> 25:38.400
Can you?

25:39.300 --> 25:40.400
I've learned a lot

25:40.500 --> 25:41.700
from him about people.

25:42.500 --> 25:43.000
But...?

25:44.500 --> 25:46.900
It's not that Booth
has a sixth sense.

25:47.200 --> 25:50.600
There is demonstrably
no sixth sense to have.

25:50.800 --> 25:52.200
Obviously, he reads

25:52.300 --> 25:54.900
minutiae of body language...

25:56.000 --> 25:57.200
pupil dilation...

25:57.500 --> 25:59.100
Yes, you... you don't sound

25:59.200 --> 26:01.400
very satisfied with your
own argument there.

26:02.000 --> 26:03.300
Booth likes to say,

26:03.400 --> 26:07.000
"There are more things
in heaven and earth, Bones,

26:07.100 --> 26:09.000
than are dreamt of
in your science."

26:09.200 --> 26:11.800
That's, um...
a bastardization

26:11.900 --> 26:13.600
of a writer named
Shakespeare,

26:13.700 --> 26:15.200
from a play called <i>Hamlet.</i>

26:15.300 --> 26:18.000
Yes, yes. I-I was, um...

26:18.900 --> 26:20.000
I was aware of that.

26:20.800 --> 26:25.200
So if you're so
uncomfortable here, why come?

26:25.500 --> 26:26.500
Because...

26:27.600 --> 26:29.200
something goes on in here.

26:29.200 --> 26:30.200
He does something.

26:30.300 --> 26:32.000
And you want
to find out what it is.

26:32.100 --> 26:34.100
Dissect it so that you can
do it yourself.

26:34.200 --> 26:35.200
Yes.
So that

26:35.300 --> 26:36.800
you can do it without Booth.

26:36.900 --> 26:38.900
So that you won't
need him anymore.
No.

26:39.500 --> 26:40.500
No?
No,

26:40.600 --> 26:42.000
I just want to observe.

26:42.400 --> 26:44.100
Surely if you want to
observe, you can do that

26:44.200 --> 26:46.400
the other side of the
mirror there, instead of

26:46.800 --> 26:49.300
insisting on being
in this room with him,

26:49.400 --> 26:51.100
out of your element.

26:51.100 --> 26:54.500
Observation isn't just seeing,
Dr. Wyatt.

26:54.600 --> 26:56.000
It's experiencing.

26:56.400 --> 26:57.700
Ideally, I'd prefer being

26:58.000 --> 27:01.300
inside Booth's head...
you know, seeing

27:01.600 --> 27:03.500
and feeling things
the way he does.

27:03.900 --> 27:06.100
Then maybe I... I'd understand.

27:06.800 --> 27:08.400
Be one with him?

27:10.400 --> 27:12.100
In a scientific sense.

27:17.500 --> 27:18.500
Booth needs me.

27:18.600 --> 27:20.900
Hodgins has a line
on the murder weapon.

27:21.800 --> 27:22.900
Ta-ta, then.

27:23.200 --> 27:24.300
We're done here.

27:25.400 --> 27:26.300
Thanks.

27:29.800 --> 27:31.300
<i>We need to know what artifacts</i>

27:31.400 --> 27:33.600
were buried with Bishop Jursik.

27:33.900 --> 27:36.200
You see, there was no
photograph of his burial

27:36.300 --> 27:37.700
in the paperwork
that we received.

27:37.800 --> 27:39.200
Well, I'm not
allowed to pull

27:39.300 --> 27:40.500
internment records
without

27:40.600 --> 27:41.800
Father Donlan's
permission.

27:43.300 --> 27:44.100
Where is she going?

27:44.300 --> 27:45.200
Bones, Bones,
Bones, Bones.

27:45.400 --> 27:46.900
You are approaching the altar.

27:47.200 --> 27:49.500
Very sensitive area.

27:49.900 --> 27:50.300
Okay.

27:50.400 --> 27:51.600
All right, listen,
you must have known 

27:51.700 --> 27:53.700
Father McCourt pretty well.
Did him and Father Matt

27:54.000 --> 27:55.100
similar tastes?

27:55.100 --> 27:57.400
Look, the only
similarity I know of was

27:57.500 --> 27:58.700
that they were
from the same seminary.

27:58.800 --> 27:59.800
Same seminary?

28:00.400 --> 28:01.400
Look, Agent Booth,

28:01.600 --> 28:04.300
there's so much suspicion
and innuendo these days.

28:04.800 --> 28:05.800
This is a good parish.

28:06.100 --> 28:08.100
The Father makes sure of that.
What's that?

28:09.200 --> 28:10.600
It's the chalice.
Oh, no, it's,

28:10.700 --> 28:12.200
it's the vessel
in which the wine

28:12.300 --> 28:14.100
is transformed
into the blood of Christ.

28:14.100 --> 28:16.000
Don't touch it! No.
It is going to be touched,

28:16.100 --> 28:18.300
Booth, it's silver and
these little eagles

28:18.400 --> 28:20.200
are a common Napoleonic motif.

28:20.500 --> 28:21.400
You're saying
that it's, uh...

28:22.400 --> 28:23.600
possible that
this could be

28:24.300 --> 28:25.800
a murder weapon?
Yeah.

28:26.000 --> 28:28.300
Can we take this with us
or do we need to serve

28:28.400 --> 28:29.500
a warrant on God?

28:34.900 --> 28:36.300
It's a match.

28:36.700 --> 28:38.700
The silver fragments in
Father McCourt's skull

28:38.700 --> 28:40.100
came from that chalice.

28:40.200 --> 28:41.900
That officially
looks the least

28:42.000 --> 28:44.300
like a murder weapon than
any murder weapon I've seen.

28:44.400 --> 28:45.200
The green bone

28:45.300 --> 28:46.700
response indicated the injury

28:46.800 --> 28:48.300
was inflicted perimortem.

28:48.400 --> 28:49.300
That means he might've already

28:49.400 --> 28:50.900
been dead when he was struck.

28:50.900 --> 28:53.200
So we have no cause of death?
Yes, we do.

28:53.300 --> 28:54.600
McCourt was poisoned.

28:54.700 --> 28:56.100
An alkaloid called taxin.

28:56.200 --> 28:57.600
Could it have been accidental?

28:57.600 --> 28:59.100
Not at these concentrations.

28:59.200 --> 29:01.300
Well, I'll go compile a list
of possible sources

29:01.300 --> 29:02.500
of the poison at the church.

29:03.200 --> 29:04.900
So what if they went
to the same seminary?

29:05.000 --> 29:06.600
Well, then why didn't
Father Matt mention it, huh?

29:06.700 --> 29:08.700
What else is he not saying?
This is intuition, right?

29:08.800 --> 29:10.700
You're subconsciously
recalling pupil dilation

29:10.700 --> 29:12.100
or some pheromones?

29:12.200 --> 29:14.600
You know what?
We're not talking
the same language here.

29:15.600 --> 29:16.800
No, no, no.

29:16.900 --> 29:19.700
That's not a Butcher.
Come here, Tony.

29:19.800 --> 29:21.400
Why'd you always pick me,
Father? Take Sam.

29:22.200 --> 29:24.000
Let's go. Watch.

29:30.200 --> 29:32.300
Now from here,
Tony can reach around

29:32.400 --> 29:34.300
to my right arm.
He uses his left knee

29:34.400 --> 29:35.700
against my left hip and...

29:37.000 --> 29:38.900
Okay? Tony's in control.

29:39.200 --> 29:41.500
I'm helpless. And he can score
some back points.

29:42.300 --> 29:42.900
Good job, Tony.

29:43.000 --> 29:43.500
Let me up.

29:45.400 --> 29:46.400
That's the Butcher.

29:46.700 --> 29:48.300
Learn it, love it.

29:48.400 --> 29:49.900
Use it to smite your enemies

29:50.000 --> 29:51.700
in the name of our loving Lord.

29:52.200 --> 29:53.400
Pair up. Get it right.

29:55.700 --> 29:57.200
Kid took me down for real.

29:58.500 --> 30:00.200
That shot must not
be working, Doc.

30:00.700 --> 30:02.600
So... what can I
do for you today?

30:02.700 --> 30:04.800
Yeah, Father, I...
You and Father McCourt

30:05.000 --> 30:07.500
were in seminary
at the same time.
Right.

30:07.700 --> 30:09.100
But I told you, I never
met Father McCourt.

30:09.200 --> 30:10.400
What, you guys
never got together,

30:10.600 --> 30:12.200
compared wrestling moves?

30:13.400 --> 30:14.600
I didn't know him there.

30:14.900 --> 30:16.600
Did you know everyone
who went to your college?

30:16.800 --> 30:19.400
You do know why
Father McCourt was sent here.

30:19.600 --> 30:20.800
Yeah, I've heard the rumors.

30:20.900 --> 30:21.600
That's all.

30:22.500 --> 30:24.600
Do you base all your
investigations on rumors,

30:24.900 --> 30:25.900
Agent Booth?

30:26.100 --> 30:27.400
He has a point, Booth.

30:27.600 --> 30:28.900
You know,
St. Agatha's has been

30:29.000 --> 30:30.700
a dumping ground
for troubled priests

30:30.700 --> 30:33.300
for some time, so it's
reasonable to suggest

30:33.400 --> 30:35.300
that you're one of them.

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
I told you why I was sent here.

30:41.900 --> 30:43.700
I got work to do.

30:55.200 --> 30:57.300
So you still think that
Father Donlan is the killer?

30:57.500 --> 30:58.800
I mean, Matt...

30:58.900 --> 31:00.800
could have killed McCourt
and taken his post.

31:00.800 --> 31:02.800
Why?
Because McCourt
was going to come

31:02.900 --> 31:03.800
clean about being a pedophile.

31:04.000 --> 31:06.800
Maybe accuse Matt, if
they knew each other.

31:07.300 --> 31:10.600
Of course... there's
no evidence of that.

31:11.100 --> 31:12.600
I have no intuition.

31:12.700 --> 31:14.700
None. Zilch.
And you have no

31:14.800 --> 31:16.500
analytical skills.
I mean, you're all about

31:16.900 --> 31:19.200
emotion and feeling.
Well...

31:19.300 --> 31:21.300
They say that means you
have a well developed
feminine side.

31:23.000 --> 31:24.200
Who? Who says that?

31:24.200 --> 31:25.300
Psychologists.
Oh...

31:25.400 --> 31:26.900
What? You're the one
who believes in them.

31:27.000 --> 31:28.300
Let's just stick to the case.

31:28.400 --> 31:32.000
We know that Father Donlan
is this harsh, judgmental guy.

31:32.100 --> 31:34.700
He keeps being sent these,
uh, problematic priests.

31:34.800 --> 31:37.000
There's McCourt,
there's Father Matt...
No proof.

31:37.200 --> 31:39.400
Yeah, but Bones, it happens.
All right? So, anyways...

31:39.500 --> 31:41.200
Father Donlan,
he's getting old,

31:41.300 --> 31:43.900
he can't deal, so he
takes action.
Old Testament action?

31:44.000 --> 31:45.900
All right, there you go again.
You're attacking God.

31:46.000 --> 31:49.100
I'm not attacking God.
He doesn't exist.
He's not scandals, okay?

31:49.200 --> 31:50.200
Quarreling?

31:50.400 --> 31:51.400
Yes, of course you are.

31:51.500 --> 31:52.600
Uh, cup of coffee,

31:52.700 --> 31:53.700
please, Vera darling.

31:54.700 --> 31:56.000
I am here to put right

31:56.100 --> 31:57.500
what has been rent asunder.

31:57.600 --> 31:58.900
Great. You've figured
out our problem.

31:59.100 --> 32:00.500
Yes.
From three meetings?

32:00.800 --> 32:03.000
I knew what your problem
was right off the bat,

32:03.100 --> 32:04.200
if you'll forgive
a cricket metaphor.

32:04.300 --> 32:06.200
The meetings were for fun.

32:08.000 --> 32:09.900
Booth never knows where to stand

32:10.100 --> 32:11.300
when he's in the lab.
Feels like

32:11.400 --> 32:13.400
teats on a bull
whenever he's there.

32:13.500 --> 32:15.600
Ditto Dr. Brennan
in the interrogation room.

32:15.700 --> 32:18.000
Simple geography,
sense of belonging,

32:18.100 --> 32:20.100
et cetera.
But that's not the main problem.

32:20.300 --> 32:21.400
He can't possibly know.

32:21.600 --> 32:22.500
Yes, I do.

32:24.100 --> 32:25.600
You're both afraid

32:25.700 --> 32:27.800
that the reason Dr. Brennan

32:27.900 --> 32:30.500
with her boyfriend Sully

32:31.600 --> 32:34.700
might have been because of her
ties to Agent Booth.

32:38.900 --> 32:39.900
You are both...

32:41.100 --> 32:42.000
quite wrong.

32:47.300 --> 32:48.600
Why didn't I go with Sully?

32:48.700 --> 32:49.900
How's he supposed to know?

32:50.000 --> 32:51.100
Sully is perfect.

32:51.300 --> 32:54.400
We communicated well.
The sex was incredible.

32:54.700 --> 32:55.500
He invited me

32:55.500 --> 32:56.700
to sail around
the South Seas

32:56.800 --> 32:58.600
in a beautiful yac for a year.

32:58.700 --> 33:00.400
I mean, why would
anyone turn that down?

33:00.700 --> 33:03.200
In my opinion, you are unable

33:03.500 --> 33:05.000
to lead a purposeless life

33:05.100 --> 33:06.000
at this stage in your

33:06.100 --> 33:08.100
psycho-social development.
Which, by the way,

33:08.200 --> 33:09.600
is a issue you should address,

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
because a certain amount
of purposelessness

33:12.100 --> 33:14.800
is necessary to lead
a full life.
I hate psychology.

33:14.900 --> 33:16.600
You don't like it because he's
saying that all these tension

33:16.700 --> 33:18.900
between me and you
is <i>your</i> fault.

33:19.000 --> 33:20.300
On the contrary.

33:21.100 --> 33:23.500
If anything, your issues
are more pronounced

33:23.700 --> 33:25.100
given that your
behavior has been

33:25.200 --> 33:27.400
affected by what turns out
to be a quite irrational

33:27.400 --> 33:29.900
fear of being responsible
for somebody else's destiny.

33:29.900 --> 33:30.700
That makes sense.

33:30.800 --> 33:32.500
Oh, <i>now</i> you like psychology?

33:32.600 --> 33:33.700
I think you'll both

33:33.800 --> 33:36.100
be able to work together
just fine

33:36.400 --> 33:38.500
now that your minds
have been set at ease.

33:38.700 --> 33:39.900
Thank you, Vera.

33:41.300 --> 33:41.600
Ta-ta.

33:47.100 --> 33:49.500
You, uh... feel anything?

33:49.700 --> 33:50.700
Feel?

33:51.000 --> 33:52.800
Yeah. You must...

33:53.400 --> 33:54.600
feel something.

33:56.300 --> 33:57.200
I do.

33:58.400 --> 33:59.700
You know what I feel?

34:01.000 --> 34:03.600
Father Matt has been
sick a long time.

34:03.700 --> 34:05.200
He got treated for the fungus.

34:05.300 --> 34:07.100
But he hasn't shown
any signs of recovery.

34:07.200 --> 34:09.500
So?
I <i>feel</i> that's weird.

34:09.600 --> 34:11.699
I mean, his symptoms
should've cleared up by now.

34:12.100 --> 34:15.400
I feel that since Father
McCourt was poisoned...

34:15.500 --> 34:17.300
We should have
Father Matt checked

34:17.400 --> 34:18.800
for the same poison.

34:20.500 --> 34:22.000
What?
We're back.

34:22.100 --> 34:23.100
We're back.

34:23.900 --> 34:24.800
Poisoned?

34:25.000 --> 34:25.900
Yes, Father.

34:26.000 --> 34:27.100
By something
called taxin.

34:28.000 --> 34:29.300
Father McCourt
was poisoned?

34:29.699 --> 34:32.400
Poison's easily derived from
boiling yew tree needles.

34:32.500 --> 34:34.400
We have yew trees
at St. Agatha's.

34:34.500 --> 34:37.100
Symptoms include
nausea, vomiting,

34:37.400 --> 34:39.800
increased salivation,
stomach ache, diarrhea,

34:40.100 --> 34:41.699
spasms and death.

34:42.199 --> 34:45.199
Well, I have all those,
except for death.

34:45.199 --> 34:46.600
So far.

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
We suspect the poison
weakened him,

34:49.199 --> 34:50.699
made him unable
to defend himself.

34:50.900 --> 34:53.100
Defend himself from whom?

34:53.100 --> 34:54.699
Someone much weaker
than himself.

34:54.800 --> 34:56.300
Say, an old man.

35:03.400 --> 35:03.900
Yellow.

35:04.000 --> 35:05.000
Yellow?
What does that mean?

35:05.100 --> 35:06.300
The good news is we know how

35:06.300 --> 35:07.500
to make you feel a lot better.

35:07.600 --> 35:09.300
Bad news is someone's
trying to kill you.

35:12.700 --> 35:13.600
So things are
all right?

35:14.200 --> 35:16.300
According to the psychiatrist,
we were both concerned

35:16.300 --> 35:18.300
that Booth was the reason
I didn't run off with Sully.

35:19.200 --> 35:19.800
It wasn't?

35:19.900 --> 35:21.900
No. It's because
I'm currently

35:22.000 --> 35:23.700
unable to live a life
without tangible focus.

35:23.800 --> 35:27.300
So, you know, sailing around
paradise with a man I adore...

35:27.500 --> 35:28.600
You believe that?

35:29.500 --> 35:31.100
Well, if I expect
people to defer to me

35:31.200 --> 35:32.600
as an anthropologist,
I have to concede

35:32.700 --> 35:34.200
to their fields
of expertise.

35:34.700 --> 35:35.100
Right.

35:35.200 --> 35:38.100
And our working relationship
has definitely improved, so...

35:38.900 --> 35:40.200
Maybe I should
talk to this guy.

35:41.200 --> 35:41.900
Why?

35:43.600 --> 35:46.800
Hodgins asked me to move in
with him, but I'm not sure.

35:47.300 --> 35:48.500
I mean, what's
the problem?

35:48.800 --> 35:50.000
Hodgins is perfect.

35:50.300 --> 35:52.500
I'm nuts about him.

35:55.200 --> 35:56.500
I'll call the doctor.

35:58.900 --> 36:01.100
I'm certain that I am innocent
of whatever it is

36:01.100 --> 36:02.400
you think I did this time.

36:02.700 --> 36:03.700
Can you identify

36:03.800 --> 36:05.400
this clipping, sir?

36:05.900 --> 36:07.000
 <i>Taxus baccata--</i>

36:07.100 --> 36:09.500
the European or common yew.

36:09.600 --> 36:11.600
Then you're aware
that it's poisonous.

36:11.700 --> 36:14.700
Did you bring me here
to test my botanical knowledge?

36:14.700 --> 36:17.700
Both Father McCourt and Father
Matt suffered yew poisoning.

36:18.800 --> 36:19.900
The hell you say.

36:21.100 --> 36:22.200
Is he allowed to say that?

36:22.300 --> 36:24.300
Dr. Brennan's people can prove

36:24.400 --> 36:26.000
that the poison
from the yew tree

36:26.100 --> 36:27.500
came from
your own yard.

36:28.000 --> 36:30.400
Both Fathers McCourt and Sands?

36:30.600 --> 36:32.300
It's why Father Matt
has been so sick.

36:32.400 --> 36:34.500
Can you think of
anyone else who'd want

36:34.600 --> 36:35.800
to poison these two priests,

36:36.400 --> 36:37.500
aside from you?

36:42.500 --> 36:43.100
No.

36:43.900 --> 36:45.000
No one.

36:47.300 --> 36:48.700
I'm going to need a lawyer.

36:49.300 --> 36:51.500
A damn Jesuit
would be best.

36:51.800 --> 36:53.000
Are you confessing, Father?

36:53.000 --> 36:54.300
Yes. I did it.

37:01.200 --> 37:01.700
What?

37:06.200 --> 37:07.900
When this goes to trial,
Father...

37:08.800 --> 37:10.500
you'reonna have
to place your hand

37:10.700 --> 37:11.900
on the Holy Bible

37:12.400 --> 37:15.200
and swear to God
to tell the truth.

37:15.300 --> 37:16.300
You gonna be
able to do that?

37:17.800 --> 37:18.800
What's going on?

37:19.000 --> 37:20.500
Get me my lawyer.

37:21.000 --> 37:22.200
See, I don't think
you will.

37:22.700 --> 37:23.300
Why?

37:23.800 --> 37:24.600
You didn't do it.

37:24.900 --> 37:27.200
See, it's time
to render unto Caesar.

37:36.100 --> 37:36.900
On one condition:

37:38.800 --> 37:40.000
I take the confession.

37:42.100 --> 37:44.200
I never set out
to kill Father McCourt.

37:45.100 --> 37:46.300
You poisoned him.

37:46.500 --> 37:48.400
I saw the way he looked
at James LeVay.

37:49.800 --> 37:52.000
I tried to give him
just enough poison

37:52.100 --> 37:54.000
to make him too sick
to want to...

37:55.500 --> 37:57.500
But he fell
and hit his head.

37:59.000 --> 37:59.900
He wasn't breathing.

38:00.100 --> 38:01.800
I had to make
sure he was dead.

38:02.400 --> 38:04.600
I couldn't bury him
without making sure.

38:04.700 --> 38:07.100
And the heaviest thing
she could find was the chalice.

38:07.700 --> 38:08.800
And Father Matt?

38:09.600 --> 38:10.500
Wrestling.

38:11.400 --> 38:12.700
Boys were all over him.

38:12.900 --> 38:15.300
And I knew better
this time.

38:15.900 --> 38:17.600
Less poison.

38:17.700 --> 38:20.200
Father McCourt was
a mistake, Father. I...

38:20.300 --> 38:22.900
Lorraine, there was no proof

38:23.000 --> 38:25.200
that Father McCourt
touched anyone.

38:25.600 --> 38:26.600
Only rumors.

38:26.700 --> 38:27.900
And Father Matt...

38:28.000 --> 38:29.600
You were so angry
at Father Matt.

38:29.700 --> 38:30.700
I see the way you look at him.

38:30.800 --> 38:32.600
Because he was sent here
to replace me.

38:33.400 --> 38:35.700
What you saw was my own pride,

38:35.800 --> 38:37.500
my own weakness.

38:39.200 --> 38:40.800
Father Matt is a good man.

38:41.000 --> 38:42.400
I was trying to help.

38:44.400 --> 38:45.700
I was just trying to help.

38:48.600 --> 38:49.700
Do you absolve me, Father?

38:55.300 --> 38:56.000
We're not alone

38:56.100 --> 38:57.300
with God, Lorraine.

38:58.900 --> 39:01.000
This is not that kind
of confession.

40:05.300 --> 40:06.100
Excuse us.

40:07.700 --> 40:08.500
Dr. Wyatt.

40:08.600 --> 40:10.100
We need you to
do it with her.

40:11.300 --> 40:12.600
W-Would that I could,

40:12.700 --> 40:15.800
but unfortunately,
my heart belongs to another.

40:16.200 --> 40:19.300
No, it's actually
my... boyfriend

40:20.400 --> 40:21.800
asked me to move in
with him,

40:21.900 --> 40:25.400
and I need to know
if I should or not.

40:25.600 --> 40:27.400
I told her to
talk with you.

40:29.800 --> 40:31.800
Look, I absolutely refuse
to be relegated to the role

40:31.900 --> 40:36.200
of some sort of advice columnist
or daytime television shrink.

40:36.600 --> 40:37.400
Well, Brennan says

40:37.500 --> 40:39.400
that you're the only
psychological type

40:39.500 --> 40:40.900
who's ever made
any sense to her.

40:42.100 --> 40:43.900
Yes, well, now, of course
you're flattering me,

40:44.000 --> 40:45.600
so obviously I'm helpless.

40:46.500 --> 40:47.900
All right,
so what made you think

40:48.000 --> 40:50.100
you should move in with him
in the first place?

40:50.300 --> 40:51.400
The closet test.

40:51.600 --> 40:54.200
Over half of his closet
is filled with my things.

40:54.300 --> 40:56.200
I see. And what about
your own closet?

40:56.300 --> 40:58.300
It overfloweth
with his things, does it?

40:58.400 --> 40:59.600
Uh, no.

41:00.000 --> 41:01.200
It doth not.

41:01.200 --> 41:03.100
Well, then I suggest
you wait until it does,

41:03.200 --> 41:05.100
thus rendering you
manifest equals,

41:05.200 --> 41:09.100
tabling until that day
the vexed question of

41:09.200 --> 41:10.500
who should move in with whom.

41:12.000 --> 41:12.800
He is good.

41:12.900 --> 41:13.500
I told you.

41:13.500 --> 41:15.100
As a stopgap, you should remove

41:15.200 --> 41:16.800
enough clothing from his closet

41:17.200 --> 41:19.800
so as to occupy less than
30 percent of the space.

41:20.800 --> 41:22.500
You know, the accent makes

41:22.600 --> 41:24.600
everything that you say
sound really smart.

41:25.400 --> 41:26.500
"Stopgap."

41:28.800 --> 41:30.800
No, you're not leaving,
are you, Dr. Brennan?

41:31.000 --> 41:32.300
Booth and I have to put

41:32.600 --> 41:34.400
our notes together
for the prosecutor.

41:35.700 --> 41:36.300
So...

41:36.400 --> 41:38.500
So you and Booth, um...

41:39.700 --> 41:42.000
you making any further
assumptions about each other?

41:42.200 --> 41:42.500
No.

41:43.300 --> 41:44.800
No assumptions.

41:45.700 --> 41:46.800
Thanks.

41:47.200 --> 41:47.900
Good.

41:52.400 --> 41:53.900
Well, look at that.

41:54.500 --> 41:55.800
You fixed them, too.

41:59.900 --> 42:00.700
All right, listen up,

42:00.800 --> 42:01.800
Monty Python.

42:01.900 --> 42:04.000
You got it right with
Hodgins and I, that's fine.

42:04.200 --> 42:07.200
But we both know that you are
full of it on the other thing.

42:09.400 --> 42:10.800
I have no idea
to what you refer.

42:11.300 --> 42:13.300
Brennan didn't run off
with Sully

42:13.400 --> 42:15.400
because she cannot
live a life without focus.

42:16.400 --> 42:18.100
She stayed because of Booth.

42:18.200 --> 42:21.000
Ah, now you're projecting,
Ms. Montenegro.

42:22.000 --> 42:25.500
Agent Booth and Dr. Brennan
are not you and Dr. Hodgins.

42:25.600 --> 42:27.100
I stand by
my diagnosis.

42:27.200 --> 42:28.900
You stand by the FBI.

42:29.700 --> 42:31.500
Your first priority
is to get agents

42:31.500 --> 42:32.600
back into the field,

42:32.700 --> 42:34.000
solving murders.

42:34.500 --> 42:37.400
Your romanticism is endearing,
but as the Bard says,

42:37.900 --> 42:40.500
"Lovers and madmen have such
seething brains,

42:40.600 --> 42:42.400
"such shaping fantasies,

42:42.700 --> 42:46.000
that apprehend more than cool
reason ever comprehends."

42:46.100 --> 42:50.400
He also says, "Journeys end
in lovers meeting,

42:50.600 --> 42:52.500
every wise man's
son doth know."

42:52.800 --> 42:55.300
Hm. Excellent.

42:56.300 --> 42:58.600
You betcha... Monty.
