WEBVTT

00:03.958 --> 00:06.786
ER

00:06.887 --> 00:08.679
Previously on ER...

00:08.680 --> 00:10.492
John, what are you doing here?

00:10.493 --> 00:12.056
You asked me to help.

00:12.057 --> 00:14.485
You don't want your parents
to find out about the heroin.

00:14.486 --> 00:15.532
I'm- I'm not!

00:15.533 --> 00:19.062
You need a research grant to cover
your salary before the end of the year...

00:19.263 --> 00:21.096
...or look for a private practice.

00:21.097 --> 00:22.101
I'm going to talk to her.

00:22.136 --> 00:24.993
I know that I make him happy.
I know I do. I can tell.

00:25.617 --> 00:27.898
He just keeps giving me
these mixed signals.

00:27.899 --> 00:32.399
I'm like a magnet for needy people.
It's like they find me wherever I go.

00:32.850 --> 00:33.879
Like I did?

00:33.880 --> 00:36.985
- You really don't need to leave.
- Yeah, I really do.

00:38.202 --> 00:40.806
"My Brother's Keeper"

00:40.916 --> 00:42.792
You've been up all night?

00:43.129 --> 00:46.132
Just finishing.
Thanks, buddy. You saved me.

00:46.302 --> 00:48.629
How many pots of coffee
did you burn through?

00:48.806 --> 00:51.264
You should update.
This word processor's archaic.

00:51.478 --> 00:53.520
Nothing like waiting
till the last minute.

00:53.733 --> 00:54.979
Nice patch.

00:55.152 --> 00:57.230
Yeah. Well, gum wasn't working.

00:58.367 --> 01:01.573
Don't laugh. I haven't had
a cigarette for 56 hours.

01:03.836 --> 01:04.916
When is this thing?

01:05.379 --> 01:06.792
- What?
- Your presentation.

01:07.009 --> 01:09.336
- Are you going somewhere?
- Yeah, to work.

01:09.513 --> 01:13.645
- What about the luggage?
- Cynthia's. The airline screwed up.

01:13.855 --> 01:16.313
- Does she know you have it?
- She must.

01:16.611 --> 01:18.570
Why are you hanging on to it?

01:19.115 --> 01:22.119
Well, you know,
she quit before I got back.

01:22.330 --> 01:25.037
If you don't wanna see her,
you take it to work.

01:25.211 --> 01:28.380
She picks it up.
You don't force her to come here.

01:28.551 --> 01:29.880
Unless you do wanna see her.

01:31.181 --> 01:32.380
You're right.

01:33.268 --> 01:36.022
I just didn't know
she was gonna take it so hard.

01:38.000 --> 01:44.074

01:53.265 --> 01:54.429
Cynthia?

01:56.438 --> 01:57.934
Cynthia, it's Mark.

01:59.444 --> 02:00.524
Hello?

03:44.472 --> 03:45.753
Moving on. Leason.

03:45.932 --> 03:49.101
46-year-old female,
acute onset urticaria and wheezing.

03:49.313 --> 03:52.767
Possible reaction to Naprosyn
she takes for rheumatoid arthritis.

03:52.944 --> 03:55.436
- Did you check her platelets?
- No thrombocytopenia.

03:55.614 --> 03:59.116
Jerry, a guy from Kinko's
is gonna drop some stuff off.

03:59.329 --> 04:01.037
Want a July issue of Parents?

04:01.248 --> 04:02.625
- Does that sound right?
- Sounds good.

04:02.833 --> 04:05.373
Did you get my memo
reinstating formal rounds?

04:05.588 --> 04:07.914
- Can't have too many rounds.
- Like to join us?

04:08.133 --> 04:11.339
It's for Attending. Watch that
Naprosyn, it's got a long half-life.

04:11.556 --> 04:13.514
- Can anyone take a transfer call?
- Sure.

04:13.726 --> 04:14.757
Okay, Meyer.

04:14.935 --> 04:17.772
68-year-old male kicked off a plane
because he smelled bad.

04:17.982 --> 04:21.483
He had a cough and nowhere to go,
so he's here. Sorry, Carter.

04:21.654 --> 04:24.573
- Keep going.
- Matthews. Little old lady...

04:26.912 --> 04:28.076
Nervous?

04:29.125 --> 04:31.284
Don't you present
your PCA research today?

04:31.462 --> 04:32.493
Yes, I do.

04:32.671 --> 04:35.425
I read it.
You make some persuasive arguments.

04:35.843 --> 04:39.843
I have questions about the methodology.
You could run into trouble.

04:40.016 --> 04:42.223
- Too late, isn't it?
- You could postpone.

04:42.395 --> 04:43.427
I thought I was persuasive.

04:43.647 --> 04:47.017
You were. You convinced me PCA works,
but you need to prove it.

04:47.194 --> 04:49.401
- I did.
- Sorry I'm late.

04:49.614 --> 04:52.533
- Your control group has a bias.
- What took you so long?

04:52.744 --> 04:54.572
- Construction on South Shore.
- What?

04:54.998 --> 04:58.203
- Did I miss rounds?
- In progress. Could you take over?

04:58.419 --> 04:59.701
Sure. Anything interesting?

05:00.172 --> 05:03.922
Doug, seizing 5-year-old coming in.
Code 3. Suspected poisoning.

05:04.095 --> 05:05.127
- ETA?
- Right now.

05:05.347 --> 05:06.925
We can talk about this later.

05:07.141 --> 05:09.218
It's all right.
You made your point.

05:10.397 --> 05:12.474
- I was worried.
- Took longer than I thought.

05:12.692 --> 05:13.937
- You finish?
- Yep.

05:14.110 --> 05:17.944
Adrian Reynolds, 6. Found seizing
by mom near basement sink.

05:18.158 --> 05:20.781
Two seizures 3 minutes long.
Total of 5.

05:20.954 --> 05:22.200
Trauma 2!

05:22.457 --> 05:24.415
- Hey, Doug. You need a hand?
- Yep.

05:24.627 --> 05:27.298
Yeah, all right. Send him over.
Dr. Del Amico.

05:27.464 --> 05:30.217
- I can get this.
- No, that's okay. I'm fine.

05:30.468 --> 05:33.424
- Yeah. Well, we're here to serve.
- Where are we?

05:33.640 --> 05:36.762
Guy needs an enema in 3.
I'm out of here. See you in 12 hours.

05:36.979 --> 05:39.187
- I'll have something for you.
- I bet.

05:39.399 --> 05:40.479
That was easy.

05:40.651 --> 05:43.689
Mr. Kyle's back.
End-stage lung cancer, Exam 2.

05:43.906 --> 05:45.650
Carol said to give him to you.

05:45.867 --> 05:48.740
Haven't you heard?
Dr. Greene kicked the habit.

05:48.956 --> 05:50.581
Be right there, Lily.

05:50.959 --> 05:52.786
You're still smoke-free?

05:53.003 --> 05:56.125
- You got a lot of charts.
- Guess I'd better get started.

05:56.342 --> 05:59.344
- Jerry, what is all this?
- A little spring cleaning.

05:59.555 --> 06:01.181
Well, it's still winter.

06:01.349 --> 06:03.806
Did Cynthia leave
a forwarding address?

06:04.020 --> 06:07.687
- Not that I know of. Why?
- I've just got some of her stuff.

06:08.610 --> 06:10.439
That's always awkward, isn't it?

06:10.656 --> 06:13.860
- What's the extension for Personnel?
- They wouldn't know.

06:14.035 --> 06:16.528
- She came in and picked up her check.
- When?

06:17.416 --> 06:19.493
A couple days ago.

06:19.711 --> 06:21.705
Look at that. Twinkies.

06:21.923 --> 06:24.629
- You're not gonna eat that?
- They have a shelf life of 7 years.

06:24.844 --> 06:27.551
1993. I'm in the zone.

06:27.724 --> 06:31.260
Jerry, call Poison Control. Patch it
through to Trauma 2 now, okay?

06:31.479 --> 06:32.643
Sure.

06:33.023 --> 06:36.524
- Pupils are dilated.
- He's bradycardic. Pulse ox, 90.

06:36.737 --> 06:38.529
He's hot. Temp's 103.

06:38.699 --> 06:39.731
- Any vomiting?
- Yeah.

06:39.909 --> 06:41.737
- BP's 70 palp.
- Doesn't make sense.

06:41.954 --> 06:43.828
- Glucose, 110.
- No history of epilepsy?

06:44.040 --> 06:46.248
- I didn't ask.
- He's seizing.

06:47.087 --> 06:49.080
Let's give him one mg of Ativan.

06:49.257 --> 06:51.796
- No idea what he took?
- It was in this soda can.

06:52.011 --> 06:53.340
Let's see that.

06:54.098 --> 06:55.129
It ain't soda.

06:55.349 --> 06:59.397
CBC, lytes, tox screen,
give me a blood gas, blood alcohol.

06:59.605 --> 07:01.564
Get that can to the lab.
Where's his parents?

07:01.776 --> 07:04.944
Right behind us. They're bringing
anything that could be toxic.

07:05.114 --> 07:07.404
- Pulse, 45.
- .5 of atropine.

07:07.618 --> 07:11.369
- Lavage?
- Not if it's alkali, acid or petroleum.

07:11.582 --> 07:13.458
What did he take?!

07:14.796 --> 07:16.789
I took anthropology
as an undergraduate.

07:16.965 --> 07:20.503
Cro-Magnon man is considered
a modern Homo sapien, just like you.

07:20.722 --> 07:21.967
Thank you very much.

07:22.182 --> 07:24.591
I didn't say he was as good-looking.

07:25.312 --> 07:27.436
Let's bet on it. Loser buys lunch.

07:27.649 --> 07:30.900
- If you wanna take me to lunch-
- If it isn't Lucy and Ricky.

07:31.112 --> 07:34.317
You read today's Sun-Times?
There's a feature on our Lizzie.

07:34.493 --> 07:35.525
I've got a lapcholy.

07:35.744 --> 07:38.830
"Risking her own life,
the resourceful surgeon refused...

07:39.041 --> 07:40.833
...to abandon Leipzinger in the rubble.

07:41.002 --> 07:43.376
The doctor's and patient's fate
were now one. "

07:43.590 --> 07:45.797
Not exactly.
You don't have a prosthetic.

07:46.010 --> 07:47.636
- I read the article.
- I bet.

07:47.846 --> 07:50.599
Not a very good picture
of you, though.

07:50.809 --> 07:53.812
We can't all have
your devastating good looks.

07:54.023 --> 07:58.853
"Despite her heroic efforts, County
surgeons were unable to save the arm. "

07:59.031 --> 08:03.196
- At least they didn't mention my name.
- It was an oversight, I'm sure.

08:03.370 --> 08:07.370
Be sure you tell Larry King
you only fly first-class.

08:07.877 --> 08:10.370
I almost forgot.
Your six-month review.

08:10.590 --> 08:12.916
I wish it could be
as glowing as the article.

08:16.932 --> 08:18.808
- How is he?
- Is this from the house?

08:19.020 --> 08:20.514
A soda can.
What do you keep in it?

08:20.731 --> 08:22.391
- Nothing. Soda.
- Oh, boy.

08:22.608 --> 08:25.362
BP's 70/40. Resps, 32 and shallow.

08:25.571 --> 08:27.898
- What is all this?
- Photography supplies.

08:28.075 --> 08:30.152
Thinners. I don't know
how he got into it.

08:30.370 --> 08:32.280
We need to know what he swallowed.

08:32.498 --> 08:36.083
- Can't you tell?
- He has conflicting symptoms.

08:36.255 --> 08:38.414
- Treat him for everything.
- It could kill him.

08:38.592 --> 08:42.128
Did you approve a transfer from
Bellarmin? Motorcycle accident?

08:42.347 --> 08:44.174
A head injury. John Doe, no ID.

08:44.392 --> 08:46.017
Can't the poison kill him?

08:46.436 --> 08:48.477
- Can't the poison kill him?
- Yes, it can.

08:48.690 --> 08:51.361
BP's 85/50. Pulse, 50.
Resps, 12.

08:51.569 --> 08:53.978
- What's wrong?
- He's unresponsive. GCS, 7.

08:54.198 --> 08:57.320
- Did he decompensate en route?
- We picked him up this way.

08:57.537 --> 09:00.789
They said it was concussion syndrome.
Brief LOC. Stable vitals.

09:00.959 --> 09:03.083
- No CT?
- They said it was down.

09:03.296 --> 09:06.797
- Uninsured. Just needed observation.
- What, they lied to me?

09:06.968 --> 09:08.629
- Get a CT.
- Pulse ox is falling.

09:08.804 --> 09:10.299
I can't believe they did this.

09:10.473 --> 09:11.969
Should we control an airway?

09:12.394 --> 09:15.064
I knew it was a dump,
but this is gross negligence.

09:15.272 --> 09:16.732
Yeah. Sorry.

09:16.942 --> 09:19.815
Two of Versed, 150 sux
and 10 of Pavulon.

09:20.030 --> 09:22.319
- A 7.5 ET tube.
- Got it.

09:22.533 --> 09:25.489
Once we get you cleaned up,
they'll let you back on.

09:25.664 --> 09:29.249
It's not right. I sold all
my stuff to buy that ticket.

09:29.462 --> 09:31.040
Yeah? Where were you going?

09:31.256 --> 09:34.212
Am going. I am going.

09:34.635 --> 09:36.380
San Francisco.

09:36.598 --> 09:38.390
That sounds urgent.

09:38.726 --> 09:41.680
I'm gonna get a chest x-ray,
check out that cough.

09:41.855 --> 09:43.434
My daughter's there.

09:43.650 --> 09:46.403
I was hoping I could live
with her for a while.

09:46.612 --> 09:48.523
Maybe she could wire you money.

09:48.741 --> 09:50.782
I don't have her phone number.

09:51.162 --> 09:53.701
- You know where she lives?
- In San Francisco.

09:53.873 --> 09:55.702
I mean, do you have an address?

09:56.044 --> 09:57.325
Why do you care?

09:57.546 --> 10:00.383
I don't want you stranded
in San Francisco.

10:00.551 --> 10:01.880
That's my problem.

10:02.095 --> 10:06.011
I'll meet you in CT.
Call me when Neurosurgery gets there.

10:06.226 --> 10:08.385
Come on, Adrian. Can you hear me?

10:08.604 --> 10:10.728
- What happened?
- He's waking up.

10:11.108 --> 10:12.485
- Did you find the poison?
- No.

10:12.695 --> 10:15.815
Listen to me. I'm Dr. Ross.
You're in a hospital.

10:16.032 --> 10:17.861
You gotta tell us what you took.

10:18.077 --> 10:20.405
You need to tell them what you drank.

10:20.581 --> 10:22.741
- I don't know.
- Listen, buddy. Adrian.

10:23.544 --> 10:26.915
Stay with us. Come on.
What was in the can?

10:27.092 --> 10:30.343
- Eric gave it to me.
- Eric? Who's Eric?

10:30.597 --> 10:31.878
Eric!

10:32.558 --> 10:34.599
He's having a seizure.
How many is that?

10:34.770 --> 10:37.060
- His fourth.
- They'll fry his brain.

10:37.274 --> 10:38.519
- Phenobarb?
- Keith, stop!

10:38.860 --> 10:39.891
- Doug?
- Tube him.

10:40.821 --> 10:42.945
- Don't!
- What did you give him?

10:43.909 --> 10:44.940
Get Security.

10:45.161 --> 10:47.487
Tell me what you said to him,
you little bastard!

10:47.706 --> 10:50.994
Tell me what you gave him
or I'll make you sorry you were born.

10:51.212 --> 10:53.289
- He poisoned my son!
- This doesn't help.

10:53.507 --> 10:55.584
He's right, Keith. Come on.

10:55.761 --> 10:58.004
- Get back here, Eric!
- I got him.

10:58.265 --> 10:59.759
Eric?

11:01.019 --> 11:02.846
Eric? Hey, Eric?

11:05.317 --> 11:07.026
Buddy. Hey, Eric.

11:08.280 --> 11:09.525
Go away.

11:10.241 --> 11:12.531
- Listen, I'm Dr. Ross.
- So?

11:12.745 --> 11:15.534
You and I have to talk
and we don't have a lot of time.

11:15.708 --> 11:16.739
I'm not afraid of you.

11:16.918 --> 11:18.543
It's just you and me here.

11:18.754 --> 11:20.035
Your dad isn't here.

11:20.257 --> 11:23.046
- He's not my dad.
- Okay.

11:26.432 --> 11:27.809
Your brother is very sick.

11:28.019 --> 11:29.430
- Half-brother.
- Your half-brother.

11:29.646 --> 11:33.895
He'll die if you don't tell us what
you gave him. Is that what you want?

11:34.236 --> 11:35.945
- Hey, come on.
- I don't care.

11:36.156 --> 11:39.907
I think you do. I think you care.
Eric, come on. Buddy.

11:40.121 --> 11:44.370
Come on out. Buddy, come on out.
I gotta talk to you. Come on out.

11:44.878 --> 11:47.168
Hey, there. Come here, come here.

11:47.673 --> 11:48.955
Listen to me.

11:50.803 --> 11:51.919
What is it?

11:54.768 --> 11:56.762
Your stepfather did that to you?

11:56.980 --> 11:59.472
- He's gonna kill me.
- No, he's not.

12:00.151 --> 12:01.695
This black bottle, print developer?

12:01.904 --> 12:04.194
- He mixed developer with insecticide.
- Cyanide.

12:04.408 --> 12:05.951
- I got the kit.
- Where's Eric?

12:06.161 --> 12:09.282
He's all right. Start with inhalation.
Amyl nitrate perle.

12:09.498 --> 12:12.704
- Then sodium nitrate at 3% solution.
- Is he gonna be all right?

12:12.921 --> 12:15.674
Wait 15 minutes and then 30 cc's,
25% sodium thiosulfate.

12:15.884 --> 12:17.842
What is wrong?
Why won't you tell us?

12:18.054 --> 12:20.546
We're gonna take care
of both of your kids.

12:23.771 --> 12:26.441
No way. I already washed him
when he first came in.

12:26.650 --> 12:27.814
What, with soap?

12:27.986 --> 12:30.609
I gave him the bar.
The rest was his business.

12:30.824 --> 12:35.785
Can you also try adjoining cities? It's
supposed to be on Bellflower Avenue.

12:36.498 --> 12:39.252
If I don't get him clean,
he's not getting on the plane.

12:39.462 --> 12:41.752
- You know where the showers are.
- Dr. Greene?

12:41.924 --> 12:42.956
Carol.

12:43.134 --> 12:46.220
- Malik.
- See if you can get him clean clothes.

12:46.431 --> 12:48.970
- Don't push it.
- Hey, Dr. Greene?

12:49.143 --> 12:50.175
It's not trauma.

12:50.396 --> 12:53.433
He's got a subarachnoid bleed,
shouldn't have been transferred.

12:53.650 --> 12:55.690
- What did Neurosurgery say?
- I'm waiting.

12:55.903 --> 12:59.191
Grab them and get them down here.
Find out what happened.

12:59.409 --> 13:00.868
I'm already on it.

13:02.997 --> 13:04.909
How are you feeling? Better?

13:05.126 --> 13:06.621
Steroids always seem to help.

13:06.837 --> 13:08.332
Can you lean forward?

13:09.091 --> 13:10.502
Take a breath.

13:12.221 --> 13:13.336
Again.

13:14.265 --> 13:16.592
I think I need
a little more theophylline.

13:17.395 --> 13:18.855
I'll check the level.

13:20.358 --> 13:22.316
We'll need a repeat chest film.

13:22.528 --> 13:25.234
What for? To see the same ugly spots?

13:25.449 --> 13:29.152
I think the effusion,
secondary to your cancer, is back.

13:29.371 --> 13:31.864
If that's the case,
we'll need to tap you.

13:32.084 --> 13:34.707
You mean stick a needle
in my chest again?

13:34.880 --> 13:36.708
It'll make you feel better.

13:36.925 --> 13:38.040
No, thanks.

13:38.219 --> 13:40.545
I think we'll have
to admit you this time.

13:40.764 --> 13:44.431
If you were dying, would you wanna
spend the rest of your life here?

13:44.645 --> 13:46.555
You could go into respiratory failure.

13:47.566 --> 13:48.942
Take me home, Rose.

13:49.110 --> 13:52.279
I don't know, honey.
Maybe we should listen to him.

13:52.491 --> 13:56.027
Rose, take me home, please?

13:56.246 --> 13:58.405
Your blood oxygen level is very low.

13:58.625 --> 14:00.750
I'd like to put you
on a monitor for a while.

14:01.797 --> 14:06.461
Trust me, doc.
This is as good as I get.

14:09.517 --> 14:13.018
There you are. All ready
for this carotid endarterectomy?

14:13.230 --> 14:15.557
Apparently, you don't think so.

14:16.027 --> 14:19.480
You've had a chance
to review your evaluation.

14:20.951 --> 14:22.447
I thought I was generous.

14:22.662 --> 14:25.830
I'd hate to catch you
on one of your parsimonious days.

14:26.293 --> 14:28.999
Let me make something clear.
I'm your biggest fan.

14:29.172 --> 14:32.175
If I didn't think you showed potential,
I wouldn't sponsor you.

14:32.343 --> 14:33.969
Then what's the problem?

14:34.180 --> 14:36.755
- Frankly, you're distracted.
- Distracted?

14:36.976 --> 14:38.720
You came to study trauma surgery.

14:38.937 --> 14:42.557
Lately, you're more interested
in vocal cords and paramedics.

14:42.985 --> 14:45.822
I see. I suppose
I should refocus my energies.

14:46.031 --> 14:48.274
Exactly. I'm starting a new study...

14:48.494 --> 14:51.116
...on the use of HemoAid
in vascular procedures.

14:51.415 --> 14:52.958
It's the artificial blood.

14:53.167 --> 14:55.660
Thought you'd like in.
We could do a paper together.

14:57.382 --> 15:00.836
The ER at Bellarmin as much
as admitted he was a dump.

15:01.055 --> 15:03.464
Couldn't get
the neurosurgeon to come in.

15:03.684 --> 15:06.888
- What's his name?
- Zaccarria. You know him?

15:07.105 --> 15:09.063
He has privileges here.

15:10.068 --> 15:12.477
- It's a blown aneurysm all right.
- Yeah.

15:13.240 --> 15:17.240
Jerk probably heard "uninsured John
Doe" and went to his country club-

15:17.455 --> 15:21.668
He doesn't want to open himself up
to malpractice without getting paid.

15:21.878 --> 15:24.205
It's against the law
and the Hippocratic oath.

15:24.424 --> 15:28.293
It won't help much now. He's got
bifrontal intraparenchymal edema.

15:28.513 --> 15:31.088
I'll put in an ICP monitor
and manage him expectantly.

15:31.267 --> 15:32.431
That's it?

15:32.603 --> 15:34.763
Continue the mannitol,
keep his head elevated.

15:34.940 --> 15:37.611
Maintain hyperventilation and wait.

15:37.819 --> 15:40.109
- For him to die.
- Basically.

15:42.076 --> 15:44.747
Were his chances better
before the transfer?

15:44.955 --> 15:47.911
It's hard to say.
You don't know when the aneurysm blew.

15:48.127 --> 15:49.456
There's no surgical option?

15:49.630 --> 15:52.548
The only thing you could try
is a partial frontal lobectomy.

15:52.759 --> 15:55.631
The chances that
that would affect outcome are remote.

15:55.889 --> 15:57.929
- So do it.
- I can't make that call.

15:58.184 --> 16:01.769
- Who can?
- Well, Dr. Mack. She's in surgery.

16:07.991 --> 16:10.234
Hey, time to reset the clock.

16:10.453 --> 16:12.311
- Yeah.
- At least take off the patch.

16:12.398 --> 16:15.352
I did. What are you doing?

16:15.568 --> 16:19.563
Well, the copy place swears that
they sent the order over here.

16:19.945 --> 16:21.189
The presentation?

16:21.404 --> 16:25.354
- Jerry says he never saw it.
- He was throwing a bunch of stuff out.

16:25.617 --> 16:26.647
I knew it!

16:26.867 --> 16:28.906
- You kept the original?
- No.

16:29.119 --> 16:31.324
Can you help me
or are you out of breath?

16:34.081 --> 16:35.326
How's that poison kid?

16:35.540 --> 16:37.579
He's gonna make it.
Medically he's fine.

16:37.751 --> 16:41.581
Sometimes working with kids is great,
but sometimes it really sucks.

16:41.795 --> 16:45.209
Hold on. Under that crate.
Under that crate. What's that?

16:46.423 --> 16:50.087
Look at that. What is that?
Do they throw bio-hazard out here?

16:50.259 --> 16:52.336
It's probably just somebody's pudding.

16:52.553 --> 16:54.047
Why were you so late this morning?

16:54.263 --> 16:57.631
I stopped by to check on Cynthia,
see if she's all right.

16:57.848 --> 16:59.426
Yeah? Is she?

16:59.642 --> 17:01.598
I don't know. She moved.

17:01.810 --> 17:04.017
Victoria's Secret catalog, huh?

17:04.979 --> 17:08.430
Look at the label. Lily. Lily!

17:08.941 --> 17:10.767
I feel bad, you know?

17:10.983 --> 17:14.020
I don't think it was fair.
I was pretty selfish.

17:14.234 --> 17:15.859
I know all about being selfish.

17:16.070 --> 17:20.364
What was really wrong with her?
She was, you know, funny, supportive-

17:20.575 --> 17:23.444
- Good-looking.
- Yeah. She was great in bed.

17:25.118 --> 17:28.488
She was nice to me, which was
different from most women in my life.

17:28.706 --> 17:30.863
- Give her a call.
- She's unlisted.

17:31.082 --> 17:34.415
There it is. I'm gonna kill him.
Hold on to that.

17:37.963 --> 17:39.041
Jerry!

17:52.182 --> 17:56.012
- Think he'll make chief of staff?
- It's just to get closer to Carrie.

17:56.226 --> 17:59.809
Yeah. Then she'll console him,
and then they'll get it on.

18:00.021 --> 18:02.512
I don't know about that.
She's in love with Austin.

18:02.981 --> 18:05.767
- This month.
- Wait. Here, it's back on.

18:06.443 --> 18:09.396
This is what I hate.
Here's Marlena in the hospital.

18:09.612 --> 18:13.940
She's all made up, high heels.
Nobody's that gorgeous all the time.

18:14.156 --> 18:16.315
You're prettier than she is.

18:17.992 --> 18:20.400
That's the nicest thing
anybody's said all year.

18:20.619 --> 18:22.113
Don't get a big head.

18:22.329 --> 18:26.326
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You're all done.
Last round of chemo. Congrats.

18:26.541 --> 18:30.454
Next week we can go to a movie
instead of filling me with nuke juice.

18:30.669 --> 18:33.041
- That sounds fun.
- What do you wanna see?

18:35.005 --> 18:36.334
What movie?

18:37.215 --> 18:40.750
I don't know what my schedule is.
I'm working in the ER. I'm done-

18:41.177 --> 18:43.003
- Working for my dad.
- You're done.

18:43.179 --> 18:46.593
- You don't need me anymore.
- Don't need you now.

18:48.099 --> 18:50.850
You do your thing.
I'll go get your meds.

18:53.852 --> 18:58.016
Dr. Ross. Mary Jo Reynolds.
Thank you for saving my son.

18:58.232 --> 19:00.804
Talk to the people upstairs.
They won't let Keith-

19:01.025 --> 19:03.812
We are concerned
for the children's safety.

19:03.985 --> 19:05.017
That's why he wants-

19:05.236 --> 19:08.022
Both your boys are to be placed
in protective custody...

19:08.197 --> 19:11.363
...until the Dept. of Children
and Family Services investigates.

19:11.532 --> 19:14.319
It was an accident.
Eric didn't mean to hurt Adrian.

19:14.535 --> 19:17.701
This is Eric's way of hitting back.

19:17.912 --> 19:21.198
Hitting back? Nobody hits Eric.

19:21.374 --> 19:23.365
That's for the DCFS to determine.

19:23.542 --> 19:25.949
No one needs to determine it.
It's the truth.

19:26.169 --> 19:28.540
You don't understand.
Eric's out of control.

19:28.754 --> 19:32.620
He has terrible tantrums.
He throws and kicks things. He lies.

19:32.841 --> 19:34.419
He kicks his teachers.

19:34.633 --> 19:37.040
Keith has to be strict
to keep him in line.

19:37.260 --> 19:41.008
Strict? Burning cigarettes
into his arm? That's strict?

19:41.222 --> 19:43.179
Eric did that to himself.

19:43.473 --> 19:45.430
You can't keep our boys from us!

19:45.642 --> 19:48.808
- Keith's not gonna like this at all!
- He'll get over it.

19:49.020 --> 19:51.723
I'd avoid the men's bathroom
if I were you.

19:51.897 --> 19:53.935
- Who's got the kidney stone in 1?
- I do.

19:54.148 --> 19:57.268
He doesn't have money.
I'm worried about his mental health.

19:57.484 --> 19:59.856
- All right. Syncope in 3.
- Yeah, yeah.

20:00.069 --> 20:03.023
Stick your head in the OR
and find out how long she'll be.

20:03.239 --> 20:04.733
The resident checked him.

20:04.907 --> 20:06.863
Six ODs coming in. Five minutes out.

20:07.075 --> 20:09.565
Paramedics said the site
looked like Jonestown.

20:09.744 --> 20:11.616
Call Kerry.
We'll meet them outside.

20:11.828 --> 20:13.737
I know it's unlisted, but listen...

20:13.955 --> 20:16.991
...she's his only daughter.
He needs a place to go.

20:17.208 --> 20:18.999
Your guy passed his stone.

20:20.169 --> 20:21.413
Thank you.

20:22.587 --> 20:25.455
Don't go far.
We got multi-ODs coming in.

20:28.132 --> 20:31.168
This is Dr. Mark Greene
from the ER at County General.

20:31.385 --> 20:34.255
I have an older gentleman here
who has no place to go.

20:34.429 --> 20:38.211
His daughter is in the area
but he doesn't have a number on her.

20:38.431 --> 20:41.432
He says it's unlisted.
Could you help me?

20:41.643 --> 20:42.887
What's the name?

20:43.102 --> 20:46.351
Hooper. Cynthia Hooper.

20:48.106 --> 20:49.765
Okay, I've got your...

20:53.944 --> 20:55.105
Scottie?

21:05.619 --> 21:07.493
Do you know where Scott went?

21:07.704 --> 21:11.037
He went home about 10 minutes ago.
I thought you were with him.

21:11.748 --> 21:12.779
Thanks.

21:13.000 --> 21:16.866
Respiratory arrest. We intubated.
Pulse, 126. BP's 30/60.

21:17.086 --> 21:20.834
- What happened?
- Bad heroin, 3 in respiratory arrest.

21:21.047 --> 21:25.258
Roommate said they wanted to try a new
mix after it killed guys in Detroit.

21:25.467 --> 21:27.210
- Talk about a death wish!
- Not today.

21:27.427 --> 21:30.712
Another two of Narcan.
Prep a dopamine drip. On my count.

21:32.849 --> 21:35.256
- John! John!
- Yeah?

21:35.476 --> 21:37.266
- Come here!
- Go ahead. I got it.

21:37.727 --> 21:38.971
- What?
- It's Chase.

21:40.728 --> 21:42.223
- You know him?
- It's his cousin.

21:42.606 --> 21:43.767
How long's he been down?

21:43.981 --> 21:46.554
I found him in respiratory arrest
20 minutes ago.

21:46.776 --> 21:48.981
- Asystole!
- I got it. Where are we?

21:49.152 --> 21:52.899
Epi times 2, 2 mgs atropine,
2 of Narcan and an amp of D-50.

21:53.113 --> 21:54.737
Unresponsive to all.

21:55.657 --> 22:00.317
Accucheck the glucose. Get blood gas,
CBC, lytes, tox screen, chest film.

22:00.494 --> 22:01.525
I'll get the gas.

22:01.703 --> 22:04.909
Don't do this, Chase.
Damn you, don't do this.

22:10.047 --> 22:11.424
It looks like he aspirated.

22:11.633 --> 22:13.627
Amp of bicarb.
High-dose epi, 7 mgs.

22:13.803 --> 22:15.963
- Seven?
- Yes, seven. Now.

22:16.182 --> 22:17.463
Take over for me.

22:17.642 --> 22:19.019
Get a transthoracic pacemaker.

22:19.229 --> 22:23.524
Blood gas: PO, 250,
PCO, 265, pH 6.9.

22:23.735 --> 22:25.146
All right, come on.

22:25.362 --> 22:27.771
- He's been down a long time.
- Let's roll him.

22:34.209 --> 22:35.954
It's not capturing.
Turn up the gain.

22:36.629 --> 22:37.662
Severe hypoxia.

22:37.882 --> 22:39.211
- Crank it all the way!
- It is.

22:39.426 --> 22:40.921
He's probably brain-dead.

22:41.137 --> 22:43.594
Come on. Come on.

22:44.099 --> 22:45.263
It might be PEA.

22:45.477 --> 22:48.183
- No. That's capturing.
- There's a carotid pulse.

22:48.357 --> 22:51.524
Start a dopamine drip, 10 mgs
per kilo. Where's the vent?

22:51.736 --> 22:54.193
- I got a BP, 40 palp.
- How long was that?

22:54.407 --> 22:55.985
- I'm calling Respiratory.
- How long?

22:56.201 --> 23:00.284
40 minutes. I don't know how long
he was down before I got there.

23:00.833 --> 23:05.048
Tell the MICU we're on our way.
We need an EEG and a brain scan.

23:10.932 --> 23:12.761
So where are you taking me?

23:12.977 --> 23:15.102
Somewhere cheap.
You won on a technicality.

23:15.315 --> 23:17.059
That statue looked like a caveman.

23:17.234 --> 23:19.524
Really? It reminded me of Romano.

23:19.738 --> 23:22.859
That super-orbital torus,
that prognathic jaw.

23:23.076 --> 23:24.536
So much for evolution.

23:24.746 --> 23:27.617
- A retrogression.
- Don't let him get to you.

23:27.833 --> 23:30.242
Easy for you to say.
You're not a kept woman.

23:30.421 --> 23:32.580
I need his sponsorship
to stay in the U.S.

23:32.799 --> 23:34.425
He's trying to rattle you.

23:34.595 --> 23:38.594
If he gives you valid criticism,
then compensate. Overcompensate.

23:38.767 --> 23:39.882
And the study?

23:40.102 --> 23:42.096
- Well, do you have a choice?
- Peter!

23:42.272 --> 23:43.684
His name will come first.

23:43.900 --> 23:46.654
Hey, Jackie.
What are you doing here?

23:46.862 --> 23:49.485
Arranging a natural history exhibit
for Humboldt Park.

23:49.700 --> 23:51.493
What are you doing here?

23:52.580 --> 23:54.408
I'm settling a bet.

23:54.583 --> 23:57.372
This is my colleague, Elizabeth.
This is my sister Jackie.

23:57.588 --> 23:58.869
How do you do?

23:59.674 --> 24:01.335
- Very well. And you?
- Great.

24:01.552 --> 24:04.009
Elizabeth's from England.
I was showing her around.

24:04.765 --> 24:05.881
Oh, lucky you.

24:06.309 --> 24:08.884
Peter's not usually
so generous with his time.

24:09.773 --> 24:11.897
Yeah. Well, you know...

24:12.695 --> 24:16.195
It's important that
we support our colleagues.

24:16.408 --> 24:17.868
Of course.

24:18.078 --> 24:20.748
Yes. We support each other
quite often.

24:28.802 --> 24:30.381
You've reached the Hooper residence.

24:30.596 --> 24:34.264
I can't take your call right now,
but please leave a message. Thanks.

24:36.857 --> 24:38.601
Hey. You wanted to see me?

24:38.818 --> 24:42.603
Yeah. A 4-year-old came in wheezing.

24:51.504 --> 24:53.248
Did you get the EEG?

24:53.799 --> 24:55.175
Slow diffuse activity.

24:56.470 --> 24:58.760
- You think I pushed too far?
- No.

25:00.434 --> 25:03.852
- I'd have done the same thing.
- I should've gotten him into detox.

25:04.065 --> 25:06.023
If he didn't want to,
it wouldn't work.

25:06.695 --> 25:09.482
You helped him the only way
he'd let himself be helped.

25:11.076 --> 25:13.615
- A lot of good it did.
- Did you call your family?

25:15.291 --> 25:17.664
His folks are in Singapore.

25:19.129 --> 25:21.622
My grandparents are on their way.

25:26.558 --> 25:28.682
That's probably my neurosurgeon.

25:32.192 --> 25:33.224
You'll be okay?

25:35.155 --> 25:37.398
Yeah. Sure.

25:53.391 --> 25:56.762
Impending respiratory failure.
BP's 90 palp. Resps, 40.

25:56.980 --> 25:59.306
O2's at 10 liters.
He fought us all the way.

25:59.526 --> 26:00.605
Trauma 1.

26:00.777 --> 26:03.400
He didn't wanna come,
but I've never seen him this bad.

26:03.615 --> 26:06.072
- You did the right thing.
- Pulse ox down to 88.

26:06.286 --> 26:08.529
We started an IV.
He wouldn't let us intubate.

26:08.748 --> 26:11.786
Okay. Mr. Kyle, we're gonna
take care of you.

26:11.962 --> 26:16.507
We're gonna get a chest x-ray.
We'll probably have to do that tap.

26:16.886 --> 26:20.090
Will he be here long?
I promised he wouldn't have to stay.

26:20.307 --> 26:22.846
I'm afraid we'll have
to admit him this time.

26:23.062 --> 26:24.722
All right. On my count.

26:26.192 --> 26:28.601
- Can I help you?
- Are you his doctor?

26:28.779 --> 26:29.810
Do you know him?

26:30.030 --> 26:32.605
I'm his son. What happened?
How did he get here?

26:32.868 --> 26:36.570
We're not exactly sure.
We don't even know his name.

26:36.791 --> 26:38.536
Tom. Tom Dibble.

26:38.752 --> 26:41.541
- How did you find...?
- Cops. They had his motorcycle.

26:41.757 --> 26:44.047
They sent me to the wrong hospital.

26:44.261 --> 26:48.047
- The other hospital sent him here.
- Why? What's wrong with him?

26:50.103 --> 26:51.847
He had a brain hemorrhage.

26:52.315 --> 26:54.807
- He wasn't wearing his helmet?
- Not from the trauma.

26:55.028 --> 26:59.858
He had an aneurysm. A vessel ruptured.
It probably caused the crash.

27:00.535 --> 27:02.114
What do you do to fix it?

27:02.330 --> 27:06.033
We're trying to relieve the
intracranial pressure with medication.

27:06.211 --> 27:07.671
But it's not working?

27:07.880 --> 27:10.171
I'm waiting for Neurosurgery
to take a look.

27:10.384 --> 27:11.548
They can operate?

27:11.761 --> 27:15.381
There's a slim chance that a partial
frontal lobectomy might work.

27:15.559 --> 27:16.639
And if it doesn't?

27:18.188 --> 27:19.683
He'll die?

27:20.191 --> 27:21.567
He might.

27:22.778 --> 27:23.942
That's a mess.

27:24.156 --> 27:25.531
End-stage lung cancer.

27:25.741 --> 27:27.735
- He's still alive?
- If you call it living.

27:27.911 --> 27:29.905
- He's a smoker, right?
- Yeah.

27:30.081 --> 27:32.074
Shouldn't you be at a podium?

27:32.293 --> 27:33.753
- You present today?
- Let's go.

27:33.921 --> 27:38.502
She's going? You use my computer,
you don't tell me, but she gets to go?

27:38.720 --> 27:40.095
Someone has to hold cue cards.

27:40.263 --> 27:43.219
- Can somebody see this colicky baby?
- I'll take that.

27:43.435 --> 27:46.010
No, no, I will.
I wouldn't want you to be late.

27:46.231 --> 27:49.269
- Call me if you need a second opinion.
- I can handle it.

27:50.112 --> 27:51.607
Is Scott upstairs?

27:51.781 --> 27:52.813
In the bathroom.

27:52.992 --> 27:56.611
Jeanie! Jeanie, come look!
I made a fort in my room!

27:56.789 --> 27:58.782
I want to check on your brother.

27:58.959 --> 28:01.451
- He wants us to leave him alone.
- I know.

28:01.629 --> 28:04.003
Get your sticker book
and I'll meet you there.

28:10.728 --> 28:11.807
Scott?

28:14.316 --> 28:15.562
Scottie.

28:20.450 --> 28:21.482
Forgot your Zofran.

28:24.999 --> 28:26.328
Where's your IV?

28:26.501 --> 28:29.457
- It's empty. I took it out.
- By yourself?

28:29.673 --> 28:32.000
I saw you do it a hundred times.

28:32.511 --> 28:33.922
You took off on me.

28:34.138 --> 28:37.141
Ask my dad.
He'll pay your cab fare.

28:38.979 --> 28:41.935
Your dad paid me to help you
through your chemo...

28:42.151 --> 28:44.689
...but we don't have
to stop being friends.

28:44.862 --> 28:47.437
I have friends.
I don't need any more.

28:47.867 --> 28:49.327
That sucks.

28:49.995 --> 28:51.111
Why?

28:51.832 --> 28:53.707
I need all the friends I can get.

28:55.045 --> 28:56.873
So how about Saturday?

28:57.090 --> 28:58.550
How about it?

28:59.052 --> 29:01.295
I can't go Friday,
but I can Saturday.

29:01.514 --> 29:03.306
Unless you're too cool.

29:04.518 --> 29:05.894
You are pretty sorry.

29:06.355 --> 29:08.893
Speak for yourself, Captain Baldy.

29:09.776 --> 29:12.945
Next month my hair will grow back
and you'll still be sorry.

29:13.157 --> 29:15.696
Just for that, I get to pick the movie.

29:16.244 --> 29:18.653
No way. No chick flicks.

29:18.873 --> 29:20.749
Oh, right, Mr. Days of Our Lives.

29:23.839 --> 29:25.668
I can't believe it. She's quiet.

29:25.884 --> 29:28.009
I'll give you a fact sheet on colic.

29:28.222 --> 29:32.970
Let me stay until her next feeding
so you can see how bad she gets.

29:33.187 --> 29:35.940
No problem. I'll check her
in a little while.

29:36.192 --> 29:40.737
Chuny, tell Mark I'm going over
to the med school for a half an hour.

29:41.867 --> 29:43.825
Hey, who called the Grim Reaper?

29:46.792 --> 29:48.916
What are you doing down here?

29:49.128 --> 29:50.588
I heard his family came in.

29:50.797 --> 29:53.337
We're not ready to talk
about organ donation.

29:53.552 --> 29:57.337
I just came down to do an apnea test,
see how close he was.

29:57.516 --> 29:58.715
He's not brain-dead.

29:58.935 --> 30:01.095
Neurosurgery said
it's a matter of time.

30:01.314 --> 30:04.186
- I don't care what they said.
- Dr. Del Amico?

30:04.402 --> 30:07.190
Yeah. Hold on.
I haven't given up on him yet.

30:08.325 --> 30:10.782
What was that thing you
said they could try?

30:10.995 --> 30:13.535
- A partial frontal lobectomy.
- No.

30:13.708 --> 30:16.035
I'm sorry.
There's nothing more we can do.

30:16.254 --> 30:18.711
- Your resident said it was possible.
- He shouldn't have.

30:18.883 --> 30:23.428
It's worth a shot. He's a Teamster.
He's got great insurance.

30:23.640 --> 30:27.224
That isn't it. It's just that
surgery isn't warranted in this case.

30:27.437 --> 30:28.896
He might die if you don't.

30:29.106 --> 30:31.480
I'm afraid he will die,
no matter what.

30:33.780 --> 30:36.902
I want a second opinion.
You say one thing, she says another.

30:37.077 --> 30:40.864
I'm the chief neurosurgeon. You'll
have to get it from another hospital.

30:41.083 --> 30:43.042
- I want all of his records.
- Sure.

30:43.420 --> 30:46.672
I'm really very sorry.
I wish I could help.

30:49.680 --> 30:51.389
Excuse me for a second.

30:52.226 --> 30:55.726
Pardon me, Dr. Mack.
I don't understand. He's right.

30:55.939 --> 30:58.776
If the patient's gonna die,
why not at least try?

30:58.986 --> 31:00.528
There's no indication for one.

31:00.738 --> 31:02.198
Isn't it worth the effort?

31:02.408 --> 31:05.279
We don't perform brain surgery
for the heck of it.

31:05.454 --> 31:09.918
I understand that. But someone needs
to take a risk and try to help him.

31:10.127 --> 31:12.584
Bellarmin dumped him.
We wanna harvest his organs.

31:12.798 --> 31:14.958
He deserves a chance,
no matter how remote.

31:15.135 --> 31:19.350
There is no chance. I appreciate
that you wanna do something...

31:19.560 --> 31:22.977
...but know what you're talking about
before you play on someone's hope.

31:24.442 --> 31:26.815
That kid's already lost his father.

31:31.703 --> 31:36.332
The heroin depressed his respiratory
center, which led to cardiac arrest.

31:36.544 --> 31:38.668
We got his heart going again...

31:39.339 --> 31:42.627
...but everything indicates
his brain was deprived of oxygen...

31:42.845 --> 31:44.470
...for a significant time.

31:44.681 --> 31:46.508
But you don't know for sure.

31:46.684 --> 31:51.016
No. His pupils are reactive.
He withdraws from painful stimuli...

31:51.232 --> 31:53.986
...but his brainwave activity
is slow and diffuse.

31:54.195 --> 31:57.234
- Speak English, son.
- He has probable brain damage.

31:57.493 --> 32:01.492
- What's "probable"?
- Can't be quantified.

32:02.083 --> 32:05.039
It could run from memory impairment...

32:05.255 --> 32:07.830
...to a chronic vegetative state.

32:10.762 --> 32:12.472
Did you know about this?

32:13.266 --> 32:15.011
- The drug use?
- Yes, drug use!

32:15.645 --> 32:16.891
Oh, John.

32:18.608 --> 32:21.100
- Did you think to do anything?
- I helped him detox.

32:21.321 --> 32:22.602
Where? Here?

32:23.407 --> 32:24.523
No, his apartment.

32:24.952 --> 32:26.530
His apartment?

32:27.372 --> 32:29.699
What kind of medicine do you practice?

32:30.000 --> 32:32.873
There are centers that take care
of this sort of thing.

32:33.590 --> 32:34.788
He didn't want it that way.

32:35.008 --> 32:39.056
- It was not your decision, John.
- No. No. It was his.

32:39.265 --> 32:42.137
It should've been ours!
He's on heroin, for God's sake!

32:42.353 --> 32:45.890
He had no ability to apply
good judgment, but you should have.

32:46.109 --> 32:48.566
Called your family!
We could have handled it!

32:49.156 --> 32:50.484
I'm sorry.

32:50.699 --> 32:53.026
I'll call Dr. Levy.
We'll get him out of here.

33:01.299 --> 33:03.708
Only one child reached
the lockout dose-

33:03.886 --> 33:07.756
But for example, your sickle cell
patient with the infarcted spleen...

33:07.976 --> 33:11.393
...you advocate letting them blunt
their pain and mask symptoms?

33:11.606 --> 33:16.235
If you had a surgical belly,
then there would still be other signs.

33:16.405 --> 33:19.657
But still, pain is
an important diagnostic indicator.

33:19.869 --> 33:22.243
We're talking about kids.
You'd say "suck it up"?

33:22.457 --> 33:25.827
- I guess I'm from the old school.
- I think that's probably true.

33:27.423 --> 33:30.709
Thank you, Dr. Ross.
It was all quite thought-provoking.

33:30.886 --> 33:33.378
Excellent work. That's it, everybody-

33:33.598 --> 33:36.387
Actually, Don,
I had a question for Dr. Ross...

33:36.603 --> 33:41.102
...regarding the randomization
of his control group.

33:41.987 --> 33:43.398
Sure, Kerry.

33:44.616 --> 33:46.075
Dr. Greene, a minute?

33:46.285 --> 33:48.444
You've been here for six months.
Call me Mark.

33:48.663 --> 33:51.619
Mark, I know this sounds
rather morbid...

33:51.794 --> 33:56.707
...but I haven't had as much
trauma experience as I had hoped.

33:56.927 --> 34:00.261
I was wondering if you might
be able to advise me on the times...

34:00.473 --> 34:02.847
...that a surgeon might sign up
for ER coverage.

34:03.060 --> 34:05.303
I hope you don't mind
nights and weekends.

34:05.481 --> 34:07.973
No. That's what
I'd presumed, actually.

34:08.152 --> 34:11.603
The gunshot wounds and knife wounds
taper off in the winter...

34:11.824 --> 34:14.398
...but spring's just around the corner.

34:14.620 --> 34:16.909
Dr. Greene, we need you in Trauma 1.

34:17.123 --> 34:19.283
- What is it?
- Lung cancer patient's coding.

34:19.502 --> 34:21.745
- What happened?
- I found him like this.

34:21.964 --> 34:24.088
- No pulse.
- Let's get him on the gurney.

34:29.184 --> 34:31.308
- Why was he out of bed?
- Where's this blood from?

34:31.521 --> 34:33.349
- He probably hit his head.
- Bag him.

34:33.899 --> 34:36.522
- Asystole.
- A mg of atropine, an amp of epi.

34:36.737 --> 34:39.194
- This looks like an exit wound.
- What?

34:39.366 --> 34:41.360
Here's the entrance.
This is a gunshot wound.

34:41.578 --> 34:44.152
- Somebody shot him?
- Where's the wife?

34:44.373 --> 34:45.833
- Call Security.
- Wait, wait.

34:47.337 --> 34:48.368
Dude capped himself.

34:50.175 --> 34:53.710
- Why?
- End-stage lung cancer. It's awful.

34:54.223 --> 34:55.801
Does suicide count as a DNR?

34:59.314 --> 35:02.352
Time of death, 17:05.

35:02.568 --> 35:04.064
I'll try and find his wife.

35:08.578 --> 35:10.037
Where's Gramps?

35:10.330 --> 35:14.081
You called him away from a union
negotiation. He'll have a strike...

35:14.254 --> 35:16.627
...starting at midnight
if he doesn't settle it.

35:16.841 --> 35:20.092
I'm heading uptown to this
Kenner Neurology Institute.

35:20.262 --> 35:23.218
Chase needs to be stable
before he can be moved.

35:23.434 --> 35:26.271
His blood pressure's supported
by intravenous medications...

35:26.481 --> 35:28.225
...and he's having arrhythmia.

35:28.442 --> 35:32.192
I've spoken to the internist.
I don't need you to explain.

35:32.406 --> 35:35.528
I'm sorry. If I could go back
and change this, I would.

35:37.372 --> 35:40.244
I assumed if he really
needed help, he'd ask.

35:40.460 --> 35:42.121
He did. He asked me.

35:46.845 --> 35:48.803
Did he tell you what made him start?

35:50.892 --> 35:54.145
I don't know.
Maybe he just felt overwhelmed.

35:55.859 --> 35:58.565
I've never understood that
about your generation...

35:58.780 --> 36:00.904
...or your parents' for that matter.

36:01.326 --> 36:05.621
In our day, we embraced our
responsibilities. They defined us.

36:08.086 --> 36:12.169
I don't blame you for this, John.
But I know you blame us.

36:13.720 --> 36:16.177
- No, I don't.
- Yes, you do.

36:16.766 --> 36:21.514
All your lives you've been indulged
and considered it oppression.

36:28.242 --> 36:30.283
You look after him tonight.

36:31.706 --> 36:34.874
Good. I'll be back in the morning.

36:50.276 --> 36:54.490
There are areas where my knowledge
and my experience exceed yours.

36:54.699 --> 36:56.574
You should have consulted with me.

36:56.744 --> 36:59.319
- You should have consulted me!
- What's going on?

36:59.540 --> 37:02.329
She was about to release
a 2-week-old baby with sepsis.

37:02.545 --> 37:05.417
- Her temp was slightly below normal.
- You made a mistake.

37:05.592 --> 37:08.166
Yeah, but that's not
what this is about!

37:08.387 --> 37:11.175
It's not about you.
It's about me. I'm the screw-up.

37:11.392 --> 37:14.014
- What's the problem?
- He has to redo his study...

37:14.229 --> 37:16.104
...after I found
a flaw in his research.

37:16.316 --> 37:18.606
First, there was no flaw.
Second, you ambushed me.

37:18.778 --> 37:21.104
I tried to talk to you
and you blew me off.

37:21.282 --> 37:26.243
You left a sick kid here to undercut
me in front of the Pediatrics staff.

37:26.457 --> 37:28.949
I cannot allow you
to push the use of PCA...

37:29.127 --> 37:31.287
...when the research
doesn't support it.

37:31.464 --> 37:34.633
- You are the self-appointed authority?
- If I have to be!

37:34.845 --> 37:36.885
You didn't help.
You almost killed a kid.

37:37.431 --> 37:40.434
- Screw you, Doug.
- Okay. Both of you calm down!

37:43.274 --> 37:46.312
- Is the baby all right?
- Fine. I gave her antibiotics.

37:46.655 --> 37:48.280
That's what's important.

37:48.491 --> 37:51.778
From now on, a pediatrician
is consulted in all Pedes cases.

37:51.995 --> 37:54.702
- I am capable of treating children.
- Apparently not.

37:54.917 --> 37:57.326
I know you're angry, but she's right.

37:57.546 --> 38:00.252
Emergency physicians are
fully qualified to handle-

38:00.467 --> 38:03.423
Hey, hey, hey! Guys!
What are you doing?

38:03.639 --> 38:06.310
- Can you wait over there?
- What are you doing?

38:06.518 --> 38:08.809
- We have to transfer him to Evanston.
- Why?

38:09.022 --> 38:11.728
He's too much to handle.
He can't control his rage.

38:11.943 --> 38:14.150
Didn't you see the burns on his arm?

38:14.363 --> 38:16.938
They may have been self-inflicted.

38:17.243 --> 38:18.702
So you're committing him?

38:18.870 --> 38:22.241
He tried to kill his brother,
and he has no signs of remorse.

38:22.459 --> 38:24.334
Did he show any to you?

38:26.465 --> 38:27.665
No, I...

38:28.343 --> 38:31.714
Look, you might need to testify.
I'll let you know.

38:35.688 --> 38:36.934
You okay?

38:39.653 --> 38:41.064
How'd it go today?

38:41.238 --> 38:42.782
Fun, fun, fun.

38:43.325 --> 38:45.899
- Are we gonna do rounds?
- Beats me.

38:58.431 --> 39:02.763
The organ donation coordinator
is coming down to talk to you.

39:02.980 --> 39:06.434
Forget it.
He's getting the operation.

39:08.656 --> 39:10.364
Listen, Alex...

39:11.452 --> 39:14.241
...when your father first came in...

39:14.456 --> 39:16.948
...I was frustrated, you know?

39:19.047 --> 39:20.541
I wanted to help.

39:20.758 --> 39:24.258
I pushed really hard to find anything
that might save his life.

39:24.471 --> 39:28.056
Unfortunately,
I was overly optimistic...

39:28.269 --> 39:30.477
...about his chances for survival.

39:32.943 --> 39:35.150
There is no operation.

39:36.949 --> 39:38.989
That was one doctor's opinion.

39:39.327 --> 39:42.081
I got a surgeon at Bellarmin
to do the lobectomy.

39:42.291 --> 39:43.785
Bellarmin?

39:44.293 --> 39:46.168
All set. I've booked an OR.

39:46.338 --> 39:47.584
Who are you?

39:47.799 --> 39:51.501
David Zaccarria.
Is this the ER intern?

39:51.930 --> 39:55.432
I'm the doctor who treated
this patient after you dumped him.

39:55.644 --> 39:57.056
I didn't dump Mr. Dibble.

39:57.272 --> 39:59.811
No. You dumped a John Doe.

40:00.026 --> 40:03.444
Bellarmin paged you. Aneurysm,
no insurance, no interest from you.

40:03.657 --> 40:06.410
We don't have time for this.
I have to get him to the OR.

40:06.620 --> 40:10.037
- Hey, he's still my patient.
- Not anymore.

40:10.792 --> 40:15.006
- Does Dr. Mack know about this?
- He has privileges.

40:24.105 --> 40:25.434
I'm sorry.

40:32.826 --> 40:33.907
Hello?

40:36.624 --> 40:38.036
Hello? Mark.

40:38.794 --> 40:41.369
Hi. Is this a bad time?

40:41.590 --> 40:44.260
- What are you doing here?
- I got your luggage.

40:44.427 --> 40:46.587
Oh, right. Sure. Hold on.

40:49.769 --> 40:51.180
How did you find me?

40:52.524 --> 40:55.526
- Can I come in?
- Oh, sure. Of course.

40:57.824 --> 40:59.616
You can put them right there.

41:01.078 --> 41:04.532
Thank you. I was wondering
how I was gonna get those back.

41:05.293 --> 41:07.620
So how are you?

41:07.839 --> 41:09.417
I'm, you know, good.

41:09.633 --> 41:11.092
Same old stuff.

41:11.302 --> 41:12.798
What about your mom?

41:13.222 --> 41:15.050
Better some days.

41:16.644 --> 41:17.807
How about you?

41:18.981 --> 41:20.392
I'm okay.

41:23.028 --> 41:24.773
It's a nice place.

41:25.115 --> 41:28.735
I got a new job. Administrative
assistant for a law firm.

41:29.706 --> 41:30.737
That's great.

41:31.208 --> 41:32.288
Yeah.

41:34.296 --> 41:37.667
I was surprised when I came back
and you weren't working at the ER.

41:37.843 --> 41:41.345
Well, I thought I needed to...

41:41.725 --> 41:45.261
I needed a fresh start. I couldn't
really do that with you there.

41:46.357 --> 41:47.637
Guess not.

41:49.527 --> 41:50.809
Mom?

41:51.406 --> 41:54.194
Oh, Jason, honey.
What are you doing up?

41:54.368 --> 41:56.327
I'm thirsty.

41:56.872 --> 42:00.326
I'll get you some water,
then you've got to go back to bed.

42:02.339 --> 42:04.048
This is my friend, Dr. Greene.

42:04.467 --> 42:05.713
Hi, Jason.

42:06.512 --> 42:07.842
Here you go.

42:15.234 --> 42:17.026
Jump in there, sweetie.

42:17.738 --> 42:19.281
Sleep well.

42:21.702 --> 42:24.325
- You got him back.
- Yeah.

42:24.540 --> 42:26.748
- Good for you.
- Thanks.

42:30.841 --> 42:34.129
I didn't just come here
to give you your luggage back.

42:36.183 --> 42:38.972
- I made a big mistake.
- You don't need to apologize.

42:39.188 --> 42:40.267
No. No.

42:40.481 --> 42:44.564
I went after you. I was a big girl,
and I knew what I was doing.

42:44.780 --> 42:48.779
No. I think I made a big mistake.

42:49.370 --> 42:51.447
I mean, we were great together.

42:51.624 --> 42:53.617
Mark, you don't love me.

42:53.919 --> 42:56.542
- I deserve better.
- You do.

42:57.966 --> 42:59.544
- I could-
- No.

42:59.802 --> 43:01.512
You can't.

43:17.997 --> 43:19.160
I'll miss you.

43:20.710 --> 43:21.991
Me too.

43:23.839 --> 43:25.003
Goodbye, Mark.

43:46.708 --> 43:47.244
Hey, I'll do that.

00:00.500 --> 00:02.000
