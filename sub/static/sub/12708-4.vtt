WEBVTT

00:01.435 --> 00:03.394
GILES: Previously onBuffy the Vampire Slayer.

00:03.438 --> 00:05.091
Mom?I'm sorry.
Your mother's dead.

00:05.134 --> 00:07.790
[flat-lining]Anya, you wanna marry me?

00:18.234 --> 00:20.411
"I've gone.
Not one for long good-byes,

00:20.454 --> 00:22.283
"I thought it best
to slip out quietly.

00:22.326 --> 00:24.067
Love to you all. Giles."

00:24.111 --> 00:26.286
DAWN:
There he goes.

00:26.329 --> 00:28.202
Guys, I need you
on board here.

00:28.245 --> 00:30.204
This is deep stuff, Willow.

00:30.246 --> 00:32.292
We're talking
about raising the dead.

00:32.335 --> 00:34.207
It's time we stopped talking.

00:34.250 --> 00:35.860
What if something
does goes wrong?

00:35.905 --> 00:39.082
I can do this, I promise,
but not without you.

00:39.125 --> 00:42.564
Osiris, here lies
the warrior of the people.

00:42.606 --> 00:44.131
[thunderclap]Let her cross over.

00:44.173 --> 00:45.479
Release her.

00:46.915 --> 00:48.177
[gasping]

00:48.222 --> 00:50.093
WILLOW:
It was Buffy, right?

00:50.137 --> 00:51.920
We saw her,
and it was really Buffy?

00:51.963 --> 00:54.009
I think we screwed it up.No.

00:54.054 --> 00:56.185
She's just disoriented

00:56.229 --> 00:59.146
from being tormented
in some hell dimension.

00:59.189 --> 01:02.018
She's been through a lot.What did you do?

01:02.061 --> 01:04.194
I haven't been to
a hell dimension just of late,

01:04.236 --> 01:06.674
but I do know a thing or two
about torment.

01:06.718 --> 01:09.329
Wherever I was...

01:10.766 --> 01:14.378
I was happy.
I think
I was in heaven.

01:14.421 --> 01:17.947
I was torn out of there
by my friends.

01:19.295 --> 01:22.037
Everything here
is hard...

01:22.951 --> 01:24.170
and violent.

01:24.213 --> 01:25.650
This is hell.

01:28.436 --> 01:31.352
[pipes creaking]

01:50.197 --> 01:53.983
So, we meet at last,
Mr. Drippy.

02:01.337 --> 02:04.298
Want me to call a plumber?No.

02:04.340 --> 02:06.212
You sure?Yes.

02:06.256 --> 02:10.173
Got the number.Dawn, I'm on it, okay?

02:14.090 --> 02:15.352
Ah.

02:18.442 --> 02:20.836
[screaming]

02:26.014 --> 02:28.147
There. All better.

03:25.116 --> 03:28.425
Man, how much water
can they fit in
one set of pipes?

03:28.468 --> 03:32.864
If I understand
right, the entire
city water supply.

03:32.908 --> 03:35.389
It's like little clown cars
in the circus.

03:35.432 --> 03:38.305
Told you we should have
called the plumber.

03:38.348 --> 03:42.003
You were right.
The plumber will make
everything good.

03:46.661 --> 03:48.575
Dawnie, you're not
eating breakfast.

03:51.099 --> 03:52.971
Dawn, breakfast
is the most important
meal of the day.

03:54.450 --> 03:57.192
It's unbelievably important.

03:57.236 --> 04:00.587
You should eat breakfast
at least three times a day.

04:08.770 --> 04:11.425
I'll, um, grab something
before school.

04:13.383 --> 04:15.603
And a big Sunnydale
round of applause

04:15.733 --> 04:18.997
for Tito the Amazing,
plumber extraordinaire.

04:19.040 --> 04:20.564
How's everything
looking down there?

04:20.608 --> 04:23.393
Like we should start gathering
up two of every animal.

04:23.437 --> 04:27.483
Basically, your pipes are shot.
I mean, the whole system's
gonna have to be replaced.

04:27.528 --> 04:30.531
What you need's a full
copper re-pipe job.

04:30.574 --> 04:35.012
Full copper re-pipe?
That sounds
potentially pricey.

04:35.057 --> 04:36.971
Well, if you have any
questions, our number's
on the invoice.

04:42.629 --> 04:43.935
That's a weird
phone number.

04:45.459 --> 04:47.461
Oh, wait.
Is that the bill?

04:47.504 --> 04:49.941
Hey, Tito cut you
a good deal down there.

04:49.985 --> 04:52.422
Those are his bargain prices,
and I did a little
haggling for you.

04:52.466 --> 04:53.553
Thank you.

04:54.816 --> 04:57.384
So we'll pay him.
What's the big deal?

04:59.516 --> 05:03.389
Um, Buffy, I know
you're still getting
back on your feet after--

05:03.432 --> 05:04.956
Lying flat on my back?

05:06.653 --> 05:09.264
Yeah, uh, but
there's some money stuff

05:09.309 --> 05:11.398
we're gonna have
to talk to you about.

05:14.791 --> 05:18.012
Okay, so you're
telling me I'm broke?

05:18.055 --> 05:22.930
Well, not yet, but--Money's definitely
becoming an issue.

05:22.973 --> 05:25.149
As in your being
almost out of it.

05:25.194 --> 05:27.456
But I haven't
spent any money.

05:27.500 --> 05:29.545
I was all dead
and frugal.

05:29.589 --> 05:33.201
I know this comes as
a bit of a shock after...

05:33.245 --> 05:37.423
a bit of a shock,
but it took us
by surprise, too.

05:37.466 --> 05:40.774
Your mother prepared
everything really well.
She had insurance.

05:41.906 --> 05:44.213
Life insurance.

05:44.255 --> 05:47.651
Which should have
left you covered,
but hospital bills.

05:47.694 --> 05:49.783
Pretty much sucked up
all the money.

05:49.826 --> 05:52.351
Which you're still hemorrhaging,
by the way.

05:53.875 --> 05:55.485
How am I doing that?

05:55.528 --> 05:57.661
No, not you, the house.

05:57.704 --> 06:00.750
See, this house,
just sitting here,
doing nothing,

06:00.795 --> 06:03.232
by itself costs money.

06:04.668 --> 06:06.060
So what do we do?

06:07.889 --> 06:11.240
Easy. We burn the house
to the ground and collect
the insurance.

06:12.240 --> 06:14.461
Plus, fire. Pretty.

06:19.074 --> 06:21.380
You guys, I'm kidding.

06:22.382 --> 06:25.079
Okay, it's bills.
It's money.

06:25.122 --> 06:29.519
It's pieces of paper
sent by bureaucrats
that we've never even met.

06:29.562 --> 06:32.566
It's not like
it's the end of the world.

06:32.608 --> 06:35.612
Which is too bad,
you know, 'cause that
I'm really good at.

06:38.353 --> 06:41.444
I'll take care of this.
I promise.

06:41.487 --> 06:43.838
I just don't know how yet.

06:46.841 --> 06:48.058
I know how.

06:49.625 --> 06:51.497
Um, if--

06:51.540 --> 06:54.588
if you wanna pay
every bill here,

06:54.630 --> 06:56.894
and every bill coming

06:56.937 --> 07:01.158
and have enough to start
a nice college fund for Dawn,

07:01.202 --> 07:03.161
start charging.

07:04.423 --> 07:05.555
For what?

07:05.598 --> 07:07.600
Slaying vampires.

07:07.644 --> 07:10.560
I mean, you're providing
a valuable service
to the whole community.

07:10.603 --> 07:12.735
I say cash in.

07:19.002 --> 07:21.571
Well, that's an idea...

07:21.615 --> 07:23.617
you would have.

07:23.660 --> 07:26.141
Any other suggestions?

07:26.184 --> 07:31.362
Well, I mean,
it's not so crazy.DAWN: Yes, it is!

07:31.406 --> 07:33.540
You can't charge
innocent people
for saving their lives.

07:33.582 --> 07:36.281
Spider-Man does.He does not.

07:36.324 --> 07:39.807
Does too!Does n-- Xander?

07:44.768 --> 07:46.682
Action is his reward.

07:50.600 --> 07:53.689
Why don't you
ever take my side?

07:53.733 --> 07:57.346
What are you talking about,
taking your side?
Anya, I am your side!

07:59.000 --> 08:01.959
[door opens, closes]

08:02.002 --> 08:04.439
You're throwing away
a gold mine.

08:06.007 --> 08:08.225
Come on!

08:08.269 --> 08:11.665
Wait up! Anya!

08:11.708 --> 08:14.668
What's wrong with you?Why don't you ask
your best friend Spider-Man?

08:14.711 --> 08:17.105
You know, if you're
not gonna support me--I'm supportive!

08:17.148 --> 08:20.673
I'm totally supportive! I'm
a flying buttress of support.No, you're not.

08:25.374 --> 08:27.680
This is because I haven't
told them yet about
the engagement, isn't it?

08:27.723 --> 08:30.771
[scoffs]
No. Maybe.

08:31.771 --> 08:32.947
Yes.

08:32.990 --> 08:35.557
It's painful and confusing.

08:35.601 --> 08:38.735
I mean, first you give me
this beautiful ring,

08:38.778 --> 08:40.998
and then I can't
wear it in public.

08:41.042 --> 08:42.826
I mean, do you know
how depressing that is?

08:44.306 --> 08:46.830
Anya, I promise.
Your waiting days
are almost over.

08:46.874 --> 08:49.572
I know it's frustrating,

08:49.615 --> 08:52.269
but the way I understand
this marriage thing,

08:52.313 --> 08:54.794
it's kind of
a forever deal.

08:56.665 --> 08:59.102
Not if you
never get started.

09:01.889 --> 09:04.630
Don't you wanna get married?

09:06.067 --> 09:07.721
Yes.

09:07.764 --> 09:09.678
So then why
won't you tell them?

09:13.203 --> 09:15.293
Because I'm still
getting used

09:15.336 --> 09:17.991
to the miracle
of a steady paycheck...

09:18.034 --> 09:19.775
and getting out
of my parents' house.

09:21.081 --> 09:25.520
And this--
this husband thing,

09:25.565 --> 09:29.568
it's a big step,
or a lot
of little ones.

09:32.222 --> 09:33.659
And--

09:33.702 --> 09:36.619
And I love you so much,

09:36.663 --> 09:40.448
I just want every step
to be just right.

09:41.884 --> 09:43.756
Really?

09:57.466 --> 09:59.816
Hey! You tricked me!

09:59.860 --> 10:03.690
Just now, with
your fancy talk and lips!

10:03.732 --> 10:07.215
You keep doing this,
and I keep forgetting,
and you keep stalling!

10:07.258 --> 10:09.826
Anya!When are you gonna
grow up, Xander?

10:15.309 --> 10:17.878
BUFFY: There's a first time
for everything
is my philosophy.

10:17.921 --> 10:21.663
This is my first big loan.

10:21.707 --> 10:23.884
Collateral? No problem.

10:23.927 --> 10:25.928
No problem.
No problem.

10:25.972 --> 10:28.802
I love that tie.
I'm a problem solver.

10:28.845 --> 10:31.892
Let's crunch those numbers.
Stupid skirt.

10:33.414 --> 10:35.938
Hello.Sorry to keep you waiting.

10:35.982 --> 10:37.679
Carl Savitsky, loan officer.

10:37.724 --> 10:41.945
Buffy Summers.
Loan applier for.

10:41.989 --> 10:45.383
I didn't know exactly
what you would need,
so I brought everything.

10:45.427 --> 10:48.865
I'm very responsible
in that way.Okay.

10:49.952 --> 10:51.955
I don't think
I'll need this.

10:51.999 --> 10:54.566
Or these.

10:54.610 --> 10:58.091
Old report cards.
Definitely not.

11:01.748 --> 11:04.184
So, about
my getting a loan.

11:05.360 --> 11:07.578
Yes, well, um,

11:07.623 --> 11:11.758
it looks as if, financially,
we have a bit of a tangle.

11:11.801 --> 11:15.283
I know. And I figured
you could just,

11:15.326 --> 11:17.980
you know,
cut through that tangle
with scissors.

11:18.024 --> 11:20.331
You know, where the loan
is the scissors.

11:20.375 --> 11:24.770
Ms. Summers,
the only collateral
you have is your house,

11:24.813 --> 11:29.384
which was never fully leveraged
and has been losing equity
over the last several years.

11:29.427 --> 11:32.735
For some reason,
Sunnydale property values
have never been competitive,

11:32.778 --> 11:36.129
and refinancing's
out of the question.

11:39.133 --> 11:42.178
Are you saying
you won't give me my loan?

11:42.222 --> 11:44.878
Well, the problem is
you have no income.

11:44.921 --> 11:46.923
No job.

11:47.836 --> 11:50.621
[screaming]

11:55.018 --> 11:56.628
No job?

11:57.890 --> 11:59.806
I wish.

12:05.419 --> 12:06.986
Hey!

12:07.029 --> 12:08.770
Are you
in the wrong line?

12:08.815 --> 12:11.251
That's for deposits.
That's for withdrawals.

12:11.294 --> 12:13.732
And this one?
It's for getting
kicked in the face.

12:14.864 --> 12:16.952
[grunts]
Stupid skirt.

12:20.956 --> 12:22.741
May I?

12:46.852 --> 12:48.549
[gunshot]

12:50.682 --> 12:52.902
Put the girl down.

12:55.470 --> 12:58.690
These things?
Never helpful.

12:58.734 --> 13:00.082
[gunshot]

13:10.049 --> 13:12.529
Now, about my loan--

13:12.573 --> 13:15.706
I'm not saying I'm charging
you for saving your life
or anything,

13:15.750 --> 13:18.144
but let's talk rates.

13:20.929 --> 13:23.889
WILLOW:
He still turned you down?
That's crazy!

13:23.932 --> 13:26.413
I mean, even if the bank
did get robbed,

13:26.456 --> 13:28.894
which you
battling demons
couldn't possibly know,

13:28.937 --> 13:31.635
you would think there would
be some kind of reward.

13:31.679 --> 13:33.855
But, no, they're like,

13:33.899 --> 13:36.250
"Oh, we're not gonna give
you money unless you prove
you don't need it."

13:36.293 --> 13:40.775
I mean, what kind
of system is that?You're asking the wrong gal.

13:44.345 --> 13:47.129
Hey, Buffy.

13:47.173 --> 13:48.870
You're mad.

13:48.914 --> 13:52.570
You noticed. It'll pass.

13:52.614 --> 13:57.139
No! Anger is a big,
powerful emotion

13:57.183 --> 13:59.663
you should feel.

13:59.707 --> 14:01.797
Well, that's good, then.

14:04.278 --> 14:05.932
It's gone now.

14:05.975 --> 14:09.717
Okay, let me
make you mad again.
Uh, ready?

14:10.937 --> 14:11.850
Um...

14:13.417 --> 14:16.681
Last semester,
I slept with Riley.

14:16.725 --> 14:18.945
And you know,
I really doubt it.

14:18.988 --> 14:21.947
Caught me. Big fib.

14:21.990 --> 14:26.038
To cover up
the sleazy affair
I had with Angel.

14:26.081 --> 14:29.912
Wil, what the hell
are you doing?

14:29.956 --> 14:31.826
Pissing you off.

14:31.870 --> 14:34.786
Yes. True. Why?

14:34.830 --> 14:38.051
Well, 'cause, you know,

14:38.094 --> 14:41.357
since you've been back,
you haven't exactly been

14:41.402 --> 14:45.405
big with the whole range
of human emotions thing.

14:47.190 --> 14:50.715
What do you mean?Well, you haven't--

14:50.759 --> 14:53.240
No, I mean,
it's just, um--

14:55.981 --> 14:59.288
You know, this is
really my problem.

14:59.332 --> 15:05.207
I'm all over the place,
and you should just, uh,
forget I even said anything...

15:05.251 --> 15:08.602
'cause-- 'cause--
well, 'cause, you know,

15:08.645 --> 15:10.431
banks, man.

15:19.004 --> 15:20.528
ANYA:
Don't be such a wiener dog.

15:20.571 --> 15:22.095
Look at them.

15:22.138 --> 15:25.533
Researching demons
for the billionth time.

15:25.576 --> 15:29.231
They could use
a peppy boost of happy news.

15:29.275 --> 15:32.278
You're right.
I'll tell them.

15:37.110 --> 15:39.590
As soon as Buffy
and Willow come in.Chicken.

15:39.634 --> 15:41.157
Would you stop?Dare you.

15:41.201 --> 15:44.595
Anya, if I tell them
that we're engaged
right after you dared me to,

15:44.639 --> 15:47.597
wouldn't you always wonder
if that's the only
reason I did it?

15:49.687 --> 15:50.861
Oh.

15:50.905 --> 15:52.341
Score one
for Captain Logic.

15:52.385 --> 15:56.606
No, no. Captain Logic
is not steering this tugboat.

15:56.650 --> 15:58.696
I smell Captain Fear
at the wheel.

15:58.740 --> 16:01.830
God! I hate this!
This tone in my voice?

16:01.873 --> 16:04.398
I dislike it
more than you do,
and I'm closer to it.

16:04.441 --> 16:08.009
Oh, come on, Tara.
I am so old enough
to do research.

16:08.053 --> 16:10.186
Do you really think
I'm not mature enough?

16:10.230 --> 16:15.104
I think you're very mature
for your age,
but you're still only 15.

16:15.148 --> 16:19.369
Right.
15, as in teenager.

16:19.413 --> 16:22.024
You know,
if you don't let me
look at the pictures,

16:22.067 --> 16:24.984
I'm gonna learn everything
I know about demons
on the street.

16:27.333 --> 16:30.206
Knock yourself out.Thank you.

16:30.250 --> 16:33.514
See? No biggie.
I can totally handle it.

16:37.082 --> 16:38.998
That's a weird place
for a horn.

16:43.219 --> 16:44.786
That's not a horn.

16:46.221 --> 16:48.615
You know,
I still don't get it.

16:48.658 --> 16:51.749
I mean, what kind
of a demon would
rob a bank?

16:51.793 --> 16:54.883
The kind that wants money.What do you
even call that?

16:54.926 --> 16:57.102
This?

16:58.191 --> 17:00.192
I'm guessing on
how you say it.

17:00.235 --> 17:04.284
It's got an apostrophe.
I think it's M'Fashnik.

17:04.326 --> 17:06.460
Like, mmm, cookies.

17:06.502 --> 17:09.288
Or maybe Muh'Fashnik.

17:09.332 --> 17:13.683
Like, muh... fashnik.

17:16.948 --> 17:18.079
This your guy?

17:20.343 --> 17:21.692
You do research now?

17:21.736 --> 17:24.652
Want a cappuccino
and a pack of cigarettes
to go with it?

17:24.694 --> 17:26.784
Would you just
look at the picture?

17:26.827 --> 17:30.179
It doesn't exactly
fit the profile
for your typical bank robber.

17:30.222 --> 17:32.050
Maybe they turned down
his loan application.

17:33.138 --> 17:36.271
That's him. Big bad.

17:36.316 --> 17:38.665
This thing was strong, guys.
No weapons that I could see...

17:38.709 --> 17:43.061
[chimes jangling]but still... real dangerous.

18:01.166 --> 18:03.169
Oh, God, Buffy.

18:04.734 --> 18:07.781
You're alive.
You're here.

18:10.219 --> 18:13.569
And you're still
remarkably strong!

18:13.614 --> 18:15.920
Huh? Oh.

18:15.963 --> 18:19.968
Sorry.Willow told me, but I didn't
really let myself believe it.

18:20.010 --> 18:22.230
I take a little
getting used to.

18:22.275 --> 18:24.232
And I'm still
getting used to me.

18:24.277 --> 18:27.540
It's, uh-- You're--

18:27.584 --> 18:30.065
A miracle.Yes.

18:31.893 --> 18:34.634
But then,
I always thought so.

18:53.306 --> 18:55.481
[low growl]

19:02.618 --> 19:04.446
So--

19:06.362 --> 19:08.058
I can start.

19:08.103 --> 19:12.019
How was England?
How was life?

19:12.063 --> 19:14.761
Uh, I'm not really sure
how to answer that.

19:14.805 --> 19:17.852
Um, well, I arrived home.

19:17.894 --> 19:21.550
I met with the Council.Always a good time.

19:21.595 --> 19:25.207
Yes. Otherwise, there's
nothing really to report.

19:25.250 --> 19:28.123
I-- I keep a flat in Bath.

19:28.166 --> 19:31.778
I met with a few old friends.

19:31.821 --> 19:35.304
Almost made a new one,
which I think is
statistically impossible

19:35.347 --> 19:36.479
for a man of my age.

19:39.481 --> 19:41.222
And now you're back.

19:41.267 --> 19:42.484
Yes.

19:43.964 --> 19:46.881
Wow.

19:46.923 --> 19:50.057
Giles, are you miserable
about it, or just
really British?

19:50.101 --> 19:51.885
[chuckles]

19:52.973 --> 19:54.453
I can't lie to you, Buffy.

19:55.977 --> 19:58.719
Um, leaving Sunnydale

19:58.761 --> 20:01.503
was-was, uh, difficult.

20:01.548 --> 20:05.247
And coming back is--

20:05.290 --> 20:07.641
I'm guessing the word
is "inconvenient"?

20:09.643 --> 20:10.773
No.

20:12.993 --> 20:14.256
Bewildering.

20:18.913 --> 20:21.045
And how are you,

20:21.088 --> 20:23.352
really?

20:23.395 --> 20:25.484
You look tired.

20:25.528 --> 20:28.443
Me? Nah. Fine.

20:29.967 --> 20:32.665
I mean, yeah, you know,
sleeping's hard,

20:32.709 --> 20:35.756
but just because of the whole
waking-up-in-a-box thing.

20:35.798 --> 20:38.498
So, maybe waking up's
the problem.

20:38.540 --> 20:40.455
Yeah, but
just for a second.

20:40.500 --> 20:43.851
I sleep okay.
Great, even.

20:43.894 --> 20:46.461
Except, you know,
for the dreams.

20:50.596 --> 20:54.209
You seem to be doing
remarkably well
under extreme circumstances.

20:54.252 --> 20:55.905
I'm proud of you.

20:58.125 --> 21:00.911
Well, actually,
it wasn't me.

21:00.954 --> 21:04.132
Willow brought me back.
I just lay there.You know, I meant--

21:04.174 --> 21:05.960
I know what you meant.

21:06.002 --> 21:10.355
That was just a little
post-postmortem comedy.

21:15.056 --> 21:19.538
Oh, well, I, uh,
better start prepping
for slayage.

21:19.582 --> 21:23.412
Yes, there is always that,
isn't there?Seems that way.

21:38.471 --> 21:39.906
Giles!

21:39.950 --> 21:43.345
[groans]We're so glad to see you.
We missed you.

21:43.388 --> 21:45.259
You can't have
the store back.I know.

21:45.304 --> 21:47.480
You signed papers.I did.

21:47.522 --> 21:49.394
Do we have information
on this new demon

21:49.438 --> 21:52.006
that I suddenly
find so desperately
interesting?

21:52.048 --> 21:54.529
That we do.This one robs banks.

21:54.574 --> 21:57.010
Oh.I found him.

22:00.536 --> 22:02.538
M'Fashnik. Oh.

22:02.582 --> 22:04.800
Aha! Like, mmm, cookies.

22:04.845 --> 22:07.194
Uh, no. Quite different,
actually.

22:07.238 --> 22:09.196
You know it?By reputation, yes.

22:09.240 --> 22:11.460
They come from a long line
of mercenary demons

22:11.503 --> 22:15.986
that perform acts
of slaughter and mayhem
for the highest bidder.

22:16.029 --> 22:18.380
Well, that is
the American way.

22:18.423 --> 22:21.426
Yes, but the question
now becomes

22:21.470 --> 22:24.472
what's out there powerful enough
to control one of those things?

22:28.085 --> 22:31.261
We had a deal.
You got what you wanted.

22:31.306 --> 22:34.482
Now give me what I want--
the head of the Slayer.

22:38.138 --> 22:39.618
Okay.Sure.

22:39.662 --> 22:41.142
We can do that.

22:46.669 --> 22:50.846
You hired me
to create chaos
and carnage for you,

22:50.891 --> 22:53.197
told me
you were powerful men,

22:53.240 --> 22:57.288
commanding machines, magics,
the demon realms below.

22:58.333 --> 22:59.769
Yeah.Yeah, uh-huh.

22:59.813 --> 23:03.685
We're like super villains.[all laughing diabolically]

23:03.730 --> 23:05.775
Which one of you
is the leader?

23:05.818 --> 23:08.430
ALL: I am.I will kill the leader.

23:08.473 --> 23:11.432
ALL: He is.I will kill you all.

23:11.477 --> 23:14.567
Wait. No fair.

23:16.699 --> 23:18.875
It's not our fault
the Slayer was there.

23:18.919 --> 23:22.443
We said we'd pay you,
and we're gonna.

23:22.488 --> 23:26.883
Yes. Truly
Lord Jonathan is
the wisest of us all.

23:26.926 --> 23:30.146
Uh, yeah. Long live
our noble lord and master.

23:30.191 --> 23:31.410
You guys suck.

23:32.627 --> 23:35.848
You can't pay me
with paper, tiny king.

23:35.892 --> 23:37.851
You pitted me
against the Slayer.

23:37.894 --> 23:39.982
For that I must kill you.

23:41.157 --> 23:43.509
Then I will
suck dry your bones

23:43.551 --> 23:46.511
and use them to
beat your subjects to death.

23:47.903 --> 23:49.905
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Big guy, hey, hey.

23:49.950 --> 23:53.519
Let's back things
up a parsec, okay?
You kill us, everybody loses.

23:53.561 --> 23:56.782
You let us live,
we give you--

23:59.133 --> 24:00.613
Give me what?

24:01.788 --> 24:03.528
[muffled]
Name it!

24:03.571 --> 24:06.575
[coughing]

24:06.618 --> 24:08.750
Well, between
the three of us,

24:08.795 --> 24:11.101
we can pretty much
do anything.

24:11.144 --> 24:15.278
Like, if you want a spell
to make you look super cool
to the other demons.

24:15.323 --> 24:18.892
[grunts]I'm all over
that action, my friend.

24:18.934 --> 24:21.721
Or-- just throwin'
it out there--
robot girlfriend? Huh?

24:21.763 --> 24:24.636
For those long, lonely nights
after a hard day's slaughter.

24:24.680 --> 24:26.464
You can do this?

24:28.336 --> 24:30.598
Don't trust him.
Robo-pimp daddy's all mouth.

24:30.643 --> 24:33.776
Shut up, Andrew.
You're just mad I wouldn't
build you Christina Ricci.

24:33.819 --> 24:36.083
You owe me, man.Or else what?

24:36.125 --> 24:39.173
You'll train another pack
of devil-dogs
to ruin my prom?

24:39.215 --> 24:43.742
Graduated!That wasn't me. How many
times do I have to say it?

24:43.786 --> 24:45.221
The prom thing was
my lame-o brother, Tucker.

24:45.266 --> 24:47.397
Yeah, well, tell him
I was at that prom.

24:47.442 --> 24:49.662
Hello? Screen wipe.
New scene.

24:49.704 --> 24:52.359
I had nothing to do
with the devil-dogs.

24:52.403 --> 24:56.232
I trained flying demon monkeys
to attack the school play.
School play, dude.

24:58.584 --> 25:02.282
That was cool.Remember, everyone was,
like, "Run, Juliet!"

25:04.067 --> 25:07.330
Enough!

25:07.375 --> 25:11.770
Nothing you can offer me
will satisfy your debt to me.

25:11.814 --> 25:15.817
I don't want your toys
or your spells,
flying monkey demons.

25:15.862 --> 25:18.255
I want the Slayer dead!

25:18.298 --> 25:19.734
Okay.Done.

25:19.778 --> 25:22.694
One dead Slayer coming up.
Could you just give us
a minute?

25:22.738 --> 25:24.696
For what?

25:24.740 --> 25:27.742
Well, we just really
wanna nail down

25:27.787 --> 25:30.397
the optimum method
for us to wipe out
the Slayer for you.

25:31.529 --> 25:33.227
[low growl]

25:33.269 --> 25:35.750
Make sure it involves pain.

25:37.665 --> 25:39.755
BUFFY:
I know they're so cute,
you could die,

25:39.798 --> 25:42.410
but it's all I got.

25:42.452 --> 25:46.587
Think nothing of it.
It's, um, whimsical.

25:46.632 --> 25:49.677
They were mine
when I was little.
Couldn't find the guest sheets.

25:50.635 --> 25:54.727
Mom always did this stuff.
[sighs]

25:54.769 --> 25:55.902
They don't actually fit.

25:58.077 --> 26:01.429
I blame the sofa.
We need one of those
pull-out kinds.

26:01.471 --> 26:04.779
The kind with no payments
'til 2000-infinity?

26:04.824 --> 26:06.694
What?

26:06.739 --> 26:10.655
Oh, it's just money stuff.

26:10.699 --> 26:13.006
It turns out
Mom left me some,

26:13.048 --> 26:17.401
and while I was dead,
it got squandered
on luxuries

26:17.444 --> 26:20.578
like food and clothing.How bad is it?

26:21.884 --> 26:23.103
Anya says pretty bad.

26:24.278 --> 26:26.453
I'm kind of
taking her word for it.

26:26.497 --> 26:28.934
Actually,
I'm kind of trying
not to think about it.

26:29.065 --> 26:31.676
Sound policy.
At least for tonight.

26:33.679 --> 26:36.550
Figured I'd put it
out of my mind.
You know, take a break.

26:36.595 --> 26:38.378
Get some perspective.

26:39.728 --> 26:42.470
And then wake up
at 4:00 a.m. terrified.

26:45.691 --> 26:47.910
[sighs]

26:47.953 --> 26:50.565
Buffy, perhaps you're
putting too much pressure
on yourself.

26:50.608 --> 26:54.307
I mean, to return
from some unknown
level of hell,

26:54.351 --> 26:56.527
it's only natural
that coming back...

26:56.570 --> 26:57.833
would be a process.

26:59.051 --> 27:01.750
In the meantime,
I'm scaring people.

27:02.924 --> 27:05.057
Well, that
can take time too.

27:08.800 --> 27:12.065
Well, if it's any consolation,
life can be pretty overwhelming,

27:12.107 --> 27:16.678
even for people
who haven't been
where you have.

27:16.721 --> 27:19.942
I guess.Look, tomorrow morning,

27:19.986 --> 27:21.769
you and I will
sit down together,

27:21.814 --> 27:24.468
and we'll go through
everything, every bill,
one by one.

27:24.511 --> 27:26.775
We'll work it out
together.

27:28.907 --> 27:30.560
I'm glad you're back.

27:30.605 --> 27:33.433
Well, I'm glad
you are, too.

27:41.963 --> 27:44.052
JONATHAN:
Are we really gonna kill her?

27:44.096 --> 27:47.535
That's so sad.Shut up, Whine-athan.

27:47.577 --> 27:49.929
But I don't wanna
kill Buffy either.

27:49.971 --> 27:54.324
Yeah. She saved my life
a bunch of times.
Plus she's hot.

27:54.367 --> 27:56.935
It's her or us.
I mean, we have to do it.

27:56.979 --> 27:59.328
We're talking about murder.No, we're talking
about staying alive.

27:59.373 --> 28:02.810
And since
this is my mom's house,
I think what I say goes.

28:02.855 --> 28:05.640
But aside from
the moral issues
and the mess,

28:05.683 --> 28:07.076
we can get in trouble
for murder.

28:07.119 --> 28:09.599
Duh. You know,
the last I checked,

28:09.644 --> 28:13.517
the authorities also frown
on bank robbery too, genius!

28:13.560 --> 28:16.955
I don't even know
if we could kill Buffy.
She's got super-strength.

28:16.999 --> 28:21.002
And, you know, killing people,
this is not why we got together
in the first place.

28:21.047 --> 28:24.746
Yeah. We teamed up with one
clear,super-cool
mission statement. Remember?

28:27.356 --> 28:29.750
So,

28:29.795 --> 28:32.492
you guys wanna team up
and take over Sunnydale?

28:34.930 --> 28:36.452
BOTH:
Okay.

28:36.497 --> 28:38.106
Of course I remember.
It was last month.

28:38.151 --> 28:40.848
Then you know
we have a mission.

28:40.893 --> 28:42.894
Shrink rays,

28:42.938 --> 28:44.287
trained gorillas,

28:45.680 --> 28:47.595
workable prototype
jet-packs...

28:47.637 --> 28:50.597
and chicks, chicks, chicks.

28:50.641 --> 28:55.037
I know that's the action
I signed on for.Me too. Ix-nay on the urder-may.

28:55.080 --> 28:57.038
Vote.Okay.

28:57.083 --> 28:59.040
Who's for
not killing Buffy?

29:02.827 --> 29:04.525
Agreed.

29:05.961 --> 29:08.834
So what are we
gonna do about
this M'Fashnik guy?

29:08.876 --> 29:12.315
Ah, wait here, okay?
I got an idea.

29:15.275 --> 29:17.493
Here's the Slayer's
name, address
and telephone number.

29:17.538 --> 29:19.060
You wanna kill her?
Make it so.

29:31.856 --> 29:33.989
How'd you
make him do that?

29:34.032 --> 29:36.209
What are you,
some kind of Jedi?

29:36.251 --> 29:39.385
The Force can sometimes
have great power
on the weak-minded.

29:39.429 --> 29:41.910
Hmm.Ah.

29:44.433 --> 29:45.958
WILLOW:
Hey, Giles.

29:47.133 --> 29:48.829
You have a good talk
with Buffy?

29:50.048 --> 29:52.747
Yes, now she's back.

29:52.790 --> 29:55.968
Isn't it awesome?Mm.

29:56.010 --> 29:58.622
Tell me about
the spell you performed.

29:58.665 --> 30:01.756
Oh. Okay, first of all,
so scary.

30:01.799 --> 30:05.891
Like, the Blair Witch
would have had
to watch like this.

30:05.933 --> 30:09.198
And-And this giant snake
came out of my mouth,

30:09.241 --> 30:11.896
and there was all
this energy crackling,

30:11.940 --> 30:14.900
and this pack of demons
interrupted, but I totally
kept it together.

30:14.942 --> 30:17.903
And then, the next thing
you know... Buffy.

30:19.034 --> 30:21.602
You're a very stupid girl.

30:25.084 --> 30:27.738
What? Giles.

30:27.781 --> 30:30.001
Do you have any idea
what you've done?

30:30.045 --> 30:31.829
The forces you've
harnessed, the lines
you've crossed?

30:33.134 --> 30:35.963
I thought you'd be impressed
or something.

30:36.008 --> 30:40.011
Oh, don't worry.
You've... made a very
deep impression.

30:40.055 --> 30:43.537
Of everyone here,

30:43.579 --> 30:45.582
you were the one
I trusted most

30:45.625 --> 30:47.888
to respect
the forces of nature.

30:49.151 --> 30:51.371
Are you saying
you don't trust me?

30:51.413 --> 30:55.027
Think what
you've done to Buffy.I brought her back.

30:55.069 --> 30:58.116
At incredible risk!Risk?

30:58.160 --> 30:59.901
Of what?
Making her deader?

30:59.944 --> 31:02.598
Of killing us all.
Unleashing hell on Earth.

31:02.643 --> 31:04.078
I mean, shall I go on?No.

31:06.211 --> 31:09.954
Giles, I did what I had to do.
I did what nobody else could do.

31:09.998 --> 31:11.957
Well, there are others
in this world who can
do what you did.

31:12.000 --> 31:13.740
You just don't want
to meet them.

31:13.784 --> 31:16.961
No, probably not, but--

31:17.005 --> 31:19.877
Well, they're the bad guys.
I'm not a bad guy.

31:21.140 --> 31:23.271
I brought Buffy back
into this world,

31:23.316 --> 31:26.753
and maybe the word
you should be looking for
is "congratulations."

31:28.843 --> 31:33.020
Having Buffy back in
this world makes me feel
indescribably wonderful,

31:33.065 --> 31:36.372
but I wouldn't congratulate you
if you jumped off a cliff
and happened to survive.

31:36.415 --> 31:39.635
That's not what I did, Giles.You were lucky.

31:39.680 --> 31:42.638
I wasn't lucky.
I was amazing.

31:42.682 --> 31:44.597
And how would you know?
You weren't even there.

31:44.641 --> 31:46.208
If I had been, I'd have
bloody well stopped you.

31:46.251 --> 31:48.776
The magics
you channeled are more
ferocious and primal

31:48.818 --> 31:50.996
than anything you can
hope to understand,

31:51.038 --> 31:53.999
and you are lucky
to be alive, you rank,
arrogant amateur!

31:55.782 --> 31:56.958
You're right.

31:58.567 --> 32:00.830
The magics I used
are very powerful.

32:00.875 --> 32:05.575
I'm very powerful, and maybe
it's not such a good idea
for you to piss me off.

32:09.188 --> 32:12.669
Come on, Giles, I--
I don't wanna fight.

32:12.712 --> 32:14.236
Let's not, okay?

32:14.279 --> 32:15.977
I'll think about
what you said, and you

32:17.673 --> 32:19.153
try to be happy Buffy's back.

32:21.503 --> 32:24.246
We still don't know
where she was...

32:24.289 --> 32:25.987
or what happened to her.

32:26.030 --> 32:28.250
GILES:
And I'm far from convinced

32:28.294 --> 32:30.644
she's come out
of all this undamaged.

32:46.137 --> 32:48.140
Hello, Spike.

32:49.489 --> 32:51.185
You hear all that noise?

32:54.232 --> 32:56.017
Just enough
to make me feel crappy.

32:56.060 --> 32:58.672
You know, Watcher Boy
doesn't mean anything by it.

33:03.111 --> 33:03.981
I guess.

33:05.983 --> 33:07.681
Everyone...

33:10.553 --> 33:11.990
they all care.

33:13.469 --> 33:16.951
They all care so much.
It... makes it all harder.

33:16.994 --> 33:20.127
I'm not sure
I followed you
round that bend, love.

33:21.477 --> 33:22.739
I don't know.

33:25.307 --> 33:28.093
I just-- I feel
like I'm spending
all of my time

33:28.135 --> 33:31.096
trying to be okay,
so they don't worry.

33:32.357 --> 33:33.750
It's exhausting.

33:35.099 --> 33:36.665
And then, I--

33:38.493 --> 33:40.800
And that makes them
worry even more.

33:50.506 --> 33:53.204
You want me
to take them out?

33:53.248 --> 33:56.121
Give me a hell of a headache,
but I could probably thin
the herd a little.

34:00.255 --> 34:01.821
I knew I could
get a grin.

34:07.914 --> 34:10.570
[sighs]

34:17.838 --> 34:20.753
Why are you always around
when I'm miserable?

34:22.364 --> 34:24.539
'Cause that's when
you're alone, I reckon.

34:25.846 --> 34:28.369
I'm not one for crowds
myself these days.

34:30.545 --> 34:32.722
Me, neither.

34:32.766 --> 34:35.072
That works out
nicely, then.

34:42.384 --> 34:44.210
So, what do you know
about finances?

34:53.306 --> 34:54.875
GILES:
Dawn?

34:57.268 --> 35:01.141
Couldn't sleep?Not really. You?

35:01.186 --> 35:04.972
[chuckles]
Evidently not.

35:05.014 --> 35:09.018
You ever try mixing parts
of every cereal you got
in one bowl?

35:10.369 --> 35:12.414
[yawning]
Does it work?

35:12.458 --> 35:15.199
Gonna find out.
Wanna come join
the experiment?

35:15.242 --> 35:18.985
Why don't I be your
control group? You'll find
that as you get older,

35:19.028 --> 35:23.208
that you lose patience
with... throwing up.[doorknob rattling]

35:25.123 --> 35:27.081
Is that locked?

35:27.125 --> 35:29.257
It should be.

35:29.300 --> 35:30.867
[Dawn screams]

35:36.438 --> 35:39.614
You're not the Slayer.

35:39.659 --> 35:41.922
But you'll do for a start![screaming]

35:49.668 --> 35:51.409
You're paying
for that door, buddy.

35:53.628 --> 35:56.153
Oh! Table!

35:59.068 --> 36:01.333
You have cost me,
Slayer!

36:01.376 --> 36:04.465
I cost you? That's
a designer lamp, ya mook!

36:20.655 --> 36:23.615
Spike, no!
I want him in the kitchen.

36:33.626 --> 36:35.367
Open the door!

36:35.409 --> 36:37.847
The basement.
I'm takin' him down!

37:01.567 --> 37:02.916
No!

37:12.012 --> 37:15.536
Full copper re-pipe!

37:15.581 --> 37:17.974
No more...

37:18.018 --> 37:21.108
full copper re-pipe!

37:36.688 --> 37:38.646
SPIKE:
Whoa.

37:38.690 --> 37:41.041
Did you know
this place was flooded?

37:45.132 --> 37:47.699
WARREN:
I think we got a lot
to feel good about.

37:48.918 --> 37:51.485
We got the money.
We got the lair.

37:53.574 --> 37:56.099
And our one
loose end has been
taken care of...

37:56.143 --> 37:58.449
by the Slayer.

37:58.492 --> 38:00.364
Flamethrower's up.

38:02.367 --> 38:05.239
Periscope's working.

38:05.282 --> 38:08.373
It looks like your mom's
weeding tulips again.

38:08.416 --> 38:11.679
Action figures
fully deployed.

38:11.724 --> 38:15.597
I still can't believe it.
We did it.

38:15.641 --> 38:18.731
We can do anything.
We could stay up all night
if we wanna.

38:18.773 --> 38:21.690
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Don't get all crazy
on us, Andrew.

38:21.733 --> 38:24.998
I was only saying.What are we gonna do
about Buffy?

38:25.041 --> 38:28.175
You know, sooner or later,
the Slayer's gotta
come after us.

38:28.217 --> 38:30.481
Bring her on.We could hypnotize her.

38:30.525 --> 38:33.440
Make her our willing sex bunny.[all laugh]

38:34.876 --> 38:36.487
I'm putting that
on the list.

38:38.402 --> 38:40.492
Is this the life
or what?

38:40.534 --> 38:43.407
I mean, here we
got all the stuff
we ever wanted,

38:43.451 --> 38:44.757
and we didn't even have to...

38:46.018 --> 38:49.543
Earn it?Exactamundo.

38:50.675 --> 38:53.592
It's true, my friends.
The way I see it,

38:53.635 --> 38:57.246
life is like
an interstellar journey.

38:57.291 --> 39:00.728
Some people go into hyper-sleep
and travel at sub-light speeds,

39:00.773 --> 39:03.644
only to get where they're going
after years of struggle,

39:03.688 --> 39:06.431
toil, and hard, hard work.

39:06.474 --> 39:08.737
We, on the other hand...

39:08.780 --> 39:11.610
Blasted through
the space-time continuum
in a wormhole?

39:11.652 --> 39:12.697
JONATHAN: Gentlemen,

39:14.003 --> 39:15.657
crime is our wormhole.

39:17.005 --> 39:19.094
But everyone knows...

39:19.139 --> 39:22.534
if the width of a wormhole
cavity is a whole number
of wavelengths

39:22.577 --> 39:24.971
plus a fraction of that
wavelength, the coinciding
particle activity

39:25.014 --> 39:26.972
collapses
the infrastructure.

39:27.016 --> 39:29.367
Dude, don't be a geek.

39:33.501 --> 39:35.416
This is gonna take
forever, isn't it?

39:35.460 --> 39:39.246
Not forever.
Just a very long time.

39:39.289 --> 39:43.467
Here it is
Your first approximation
of your spanking-new debt.

39:45.251 --> 39:49.603
I've trashed this house
so many times.
How did Mom pay for this?

39:49.648 --> 39:52.172
For starters, she saved money
with this crappy-ass
coffee table.

39:53.608 --> 39:54.914
Well, there's always
that charging option.

39:54.956 --> 39:57.306
No. I will definitely...

39:57.351 --> 40:00.048
probably not
be doing that.

40:00.092 --> 40:03.878
Well, I know I'm back
in America now. I've been
knocked unconscious.

40:04.923 --> 40:08.492
Thank you.Poor, lumpy Giles.

40:08.536 --> 40:10.320
What do you think
the demon wanted, anyway?

40:10.364 --> 40:14.498
Uh, aside from
costing you a bundle?

40:14.541 --> 40:17.719
Don't know.
Now he's way too dead
to answer that question.

40:17.762 --> 40:19.938
Wish I knew who hired him.

40:19.981 --> 40:22.376
Ooh, I could do
a locator spell.

40:24.682 --> 40:26.728
Or not.XANDER:
That's it.

40:26.771 --> 40:30.514
It's been four hours.
I'm calling it, people.

40:30.557 --> 40:34.693
This coffee table,
it's gone. Damn it!

40:34.735 --> 40:37.347
Also, this lamp's
in critical condition.

40:37.391 --> 40:40.612
Well, let's take these
things out to the trash

40:40.655 --> 40:43.135
and give 'em
a decent throwin' out.

40:57.454 --> 40:58.672
Buffy.

41:01.981 --> 41:04.112
I don't think
I can do this.

41:04.157 --> 41:05.853
Yes, you can.

41:05.898 --> 41:08.943
Your mother dealt with this
sort of thing all the time.

41:10.684 --> 41:14.079
She took one crisis
at a time,

41:14.123 --> 41:15.907
without the aid
of any superpowers...

41:17.431 --> 41:19.693
and got through it all,
so can you.

41:21.043 --> 41:22.653
You sure?

41:22.697 --> 41:24.916
I'm positive.

41:24.960 --> 41:27.659
[telephone ringing]

41:27.702 --> 41:30.661
Who's calling me?
Everybody I know lives here.

41:30.704 --> 41:32.619
I'll be back.

41:34.579 --> 41:37.016
I bet it's creditors.

41:37.059 --> 41:40.018
The hounding's begun.
I read about it.

41:40.061 --> 41:44.414
So you think we'll starve?I very much doubt it.

41:44.458 --> 41:46.590
No chance
I'd have to quit school

41:46.634 --> 41:49.768
to work assembling
cheap toys in a poorly
ventilated sweatshop?

41:49.811 --> 41:52.510
Poorly ventilated--
What have you been reading?

41:54.599 --> 41:55.817
Buffy, what is it?

41:58.210 --> 41:59.733
Angel.

41:59.777 --> 42:02.780
Is he in trouble?He knows that I'm--

42:04.608 --> 42:06.567
He needs to see me.

42:06.610 --> 42:09.177
I have to see him.Well, of course.

42:09.222 --> 42:10.918
You'll leave for L.A. tomorrow.

42:10.963 --> 42:14.009
Not L.A. And not here.

42:14.052 --> 42:18.273
Somewhere in the middle.
There's a place.

42:18.318 --> 42:22.713
I see. Well, we should get
these bills and things
out of the way bef--

42:22.757 --> 42:24.280
I have to go now.

42:25.672 --> 42:27.806
Oh. Um--

42:27.936 --> 42:31.548
Thanks for taking care
of this for me.

43:14.155 --> 43:16.289
Grr! Arrgh!
