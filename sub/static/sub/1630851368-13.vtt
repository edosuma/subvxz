what do you need me to do?

31:06.398 --> 31:07.798

31:07.867 --> 31:09.032

you won't take responsibility

31:21.714 --> 31:23.046

the fingers at me.

31:47.106 --> 31:49.539

we [bleep] lost.

31:51.577 --> 31:54.411

worst-case scenario

31:54.480 --> 31:57.347

I don't care. Honestly.

31:57.416 --> 31:59.750

32:02.321 --> 32:03.754

responsibility for [bleep]

32:03.822 --> 32:05.689
losing the Pillar Challenge?
- Yes, I did. I did.

32:05.758 --> 32:07.324

32:07.393 --> 32:08.759

the reason we lost.

32:11.330 --> 32:12.696
We are not saying
you are the reason.

32:12.765 --> 32:14.431
But you can't even sit here
and have a conversation

32:14.500 --> 32:18.168

32:18.237 --> 32:19.970

to take responsibility

32:20.039 --> 32:22.005

That is it.

32:22.074 --> 32:25.309
We want you
to take this game serious.

32:25.377 --> 32:27.277
- Nelson, you just wanna put
the blame on everybody else.

32:27.346 --> 32:28.578
- Who is putting the blame?

32:28.647 --> 32:30.747

32:33.986 --> 32:35.886
No. Cory,
did I put the blame on you?

32:35.955 --> 32:37.321
No.

32:37.389 --> 32:39.856

Amanda, and after seeing

32:39.925 --> 32:41.458

- We have to talk
about these things.

32:58.811 --> 33:00.577

Go, go, go.

You don't give a [bleep].

33:13.292 --> 33:16.994
- Good. I'll play for the other
team every [bleep] time.

I don't wanna come back to you.
Leave me alone.

1:00:04.568 --> 1:00:07.669
- Team Ruby.

1:00:07.738 --> 1:00:10.272
- No.
- Yeah.

1:00:10.341 --> 1:00:11.773
- Get out of here.

1:00:11.842 --> 1:00:13.241
<i> - He loves to see people</i>
<i> miserable.</i>

1:00:13.310 --> 1:00:18.013
So I think when he's miserable
we all love to see it.

1:00:18.082 --> 1:00:20.983
Get your ass back
to the Ruby team.

1:00:21.051 --> 1:00:23.518
- All right, so, Kyle,
you are now

1:00:23.587 --> 1:00:28.156
rejoining the Ruby Cell.
And, Logan, congratulations.

1:00:28.225 --> 1:00:31.627
You are on the Sapphire Cell.
Go ahead and join your teams.

1:00:31.695 --> 1:00:34.696
- Come here, Kyle. Yeah.

1:00:34.765 --> 1:00:35.998
- Hey, partner.

1:00:36.066 --> 1:00:37.866
- Ruby.

1:00:37.935 --> 1:00:41.403
- You can't stay away
from me, Kyle.

1:00:41.472 --> 1:00:47.876
- I'm going to Sapphire
with CT, with Emy, with Kaycee.

1:00:47.945 --> 1:00:52.414
Be afraid teams, because
we are so [bleep] good.

1:00:52.483 --> 1:00:53.715
- Team, good job.

1:00:53.784 --> 1:00:54.950
- How does it feel?
How does it feel?

1:00:55.019 --> 1:00:58.887
- So nice today,
so nice today, yes.

1:00:58.956 --> 1:01:01.990
- Emerald is a strong team.
I love my team,

1:01:02.059 --> 1:01:05.594
but with every elimination
that goes by Sapphire

1:01:05.663 --> 1:01:08.764
<i> seems to get stronger</i>
<i> and stronger and stronger.</i>

1:01:08.832 --> 1:01:10.766
So we definitely have
some competition.

1:01:10.834 --> 1:01:14.036
- All right, agents, no matter
how safe you think you are,

1:01:14.104 --> 1:01:18.040
you don't win, you are always
in the danger zone.

1:01:18.108 --> 1:01:22.577
I'll see you
at the next mission.

1:01:22.646 --> 1:01:26.214
- Staying together.
- So crazy.

1:01:28.052 --> 1:01:29.418
- You wanna come to my team?

1:01:29.486 --> 1:01:32.187
I can't stop you.
I wanna run with Casey.

1:01:32.256 --> 1:01:33.755
- So you don't care, so you
want me to switch Tori out.

1:01:33.824 --> 1:01:35.891
<i> Thanks, Josh.</i>
<i> That's all I needed to hear.</i>

1:01:35.959 --> 1:01:37.259
- Oh, [bleep].

1:01:37.327 --> 1:01:38.894
<i> - Today's mission is called</i>
<i> Submerge.</i>

1:01:38.962 --> 1:01:42.164
- This is terrifying.

1:01:42.232 --> 1:01:44.566
- We are small in numbers,
but we're big in heart.

1:01:44.635 --> 1:01:46.601
We are a strong team.
