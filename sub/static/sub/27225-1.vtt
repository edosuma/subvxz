00:13.600 --> 00:15.343
- Pull up around this corner.

00:20.210 --> 00:21.980
That's far enough, stop here.

01:26.120 --> 01:27.193
- Code is 8185.

01:30.040 --> 01:31.590
- Good evening Jack.

01:33.960 --> 01:36.003
Your target tonight is Santos.

01:37.610 --> 01:40.783
Aaron has confirmed that
he is inside and alone.

01:42.780 --> 01:45.070
- Dad, when are we going home?

01:45.070 --> 01:46.920
- As soon as I've uploaded this file.

01:58.660 --> 02:01.110
- This is a
contract with MI operation

02:01.110 --> 02:02.093
cleared by Hawkins.

02:13.710 --> 02:15.118
- I'll meet you on level seven.

02:15.118 --> 02:15.951
- Okay.

02:19.530 --> 02:21.380
- I can't have any loose ends,

02:21.380 --> 02:24.237
so Aaron and the driver
also need to be taken out.

02:30.135 --> 02:31.214
- No, no!

02:35.583 --> 02:36.666
Lucas, Lucas!

02:39.023 --> 02:40.644
No, no, no!

02:45.843 --> 02:48.000
- You're the
best in the firm Jack,

02:48.000 --> 02:49.050
so don't let me down.

03:06.912 --> 03:08.330
- These two are supposed to be home,

03:08.330 --> 03:10.005
not in the office.

03:19.500 --> 03:23.742
It was you, you pulled
the trigger, not me.

03:23.742 --> 03:27.728
- Intruders on level seven.

03:48.711 --> 03:50.113
- Pull up around this corner.

03:52.300 --> 03:54.323
That's far enough, stop here.

04:49.990 --> 04:50.823
- Hey Mr. Jack.

04:51.832 --> 04:55.383
- Hi Camila.

05:05.340 --> 05:06.980
- Do you want
me to finish the dishes

05:06.980 --> 05:08.150
and then get going?

05:08.150 --> 05:09.370
- Yeah, that'll be great.

05:09.370 --> 05:10.203
No rush.

05:18.930 --> 05:21.883
Hey Monkey, you had a good day?

05:23.160 --> 05:24.410
What have you been up to?

05:28.170 --> 05:30.920
- Amber did that in
the garden this afternoon.

05:32.050 --> 05:33.250
- So you played outside?

05:36.610 --> 05:38.173
- Well, I'm all done.

05:46.253 --> 05:47.970
- Can you keep your phone on?

05:47.970 --> 05:50.550
I might need you to come
back in a few hours.

05:50.550 --> 05:51.660
If work calls me.

05:51.660 --> 05:52.620
- No problem.

05:52.620 --> 05:53.920
You know where to find me.

06:10.320 --> 06:11.693
- That's Victoria Gardens.

06:13.710 --> 06:15.410
Your mother was so happy that day.

06:17.610 --> 06:20.283
I miss her too Monkey, I miss her too.

06:38.000 --> 06:38.873
Hello Eastwood.

06:39.790 --> 06:41.173
- Not great news Jack.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.930
- It was Aaron's job to
make sure Santos was alone.

06:45.930 --> 06:48.080
- You were the one that
pulled the trigger.

06:50.230 --> 06:52.230
- It shouldn't be pinned on me Eastwood.

06:53.740 --> 06:55.873
- You broke the first fucking rule Jack.

06:58.180 --> 06:59.550
- No mistakes, I know, but

07:02.530 --> 07:05.230
if Aaron had done his job
we wouldn't be in this mess.

07:06.100 --> 07:07.830
- Don't worry about him.

07:07.830 --> 07:09.080
I've taken care of Aaron.

07:10.130 --> 07:11.780
He told me his side of the story.

07:13.700 --> 07:15.453
I'm sure we can smooth this out.

07:19.260 --> 07:21.720
You're one of my top assassins,

07:21.720 --> 07:23.987
but I need to hear full report from you.

07:25.150 --> 07:26.250
- Where shall we meet?

07:28.870 --> 07:29.703
- Uber House.

07:32.590 --> 07:33.603
- I'll be there.

07:57.520 --> 07:59.823
I'm sorry Amber, but it's getting late.

08:03.100 --> 08:03.933
Time's up.

08:20.034 --> 08:21.367
You comfortable?

08:22.469 --> 08:23.969
You need anything?

08:24.874 --> 08:25.707
Okay.

09:41.841 --> 09:43.123
- Hello.

09:43.123 --> 09:44.623
- Sorry it's late.

09:45.477 --> 09:47.880
Are you able to come over in an hour

09:47.880 --> 09:48.933
to look after Amber?

09:51.350 --> 09:53.173
I've got to go away for a few days.

09:55.090 --> 09:56.570
- That's fine.

09:56.570 --> 09:57.433
Everything okay?

10:01.191 --> 10:02.298
- It will be.

10:02.298 --> 10:03.465
Thanks Camila.

10:04.643 --> 10:06.091
- Any time.

12:18.488 --> 12:19.920
You're gonna be late for the party.

12:19.920 --> 12:21.230
- I'll be fine.

12:21.230 --> 12:22.063
Everything is set up for you

12:22.063 --> 12:23.510
and the money's in the drawer.

12:24.780 --> 12:26.040
- Mr. Jack.

12:26.040 --> 12:26.873
- Yes.

12:28.700 --> 12:29.543
- Don't worry.

12:31.040 --> 12:32.240
- Amber looks up to you.

12:33.856 --> 12:35.023
You know that.

14:22.987 --> 14:24.673
- The tarp is for you.

14:44.640 --> 14:46.390
- Sorry to hear what happened Jack.

14:47.240 --> 14:49.433
Sounds like it could have
happened to any of us.

14:52.040 --> 14:53.783
I'm sure you know why you're really here.

14:56.150 --> 14:58.343
Eastwood didn't feel like talking,

14:58.343 --> 15:00.093
but you always knew it would come to this.

15:05.510 --> 15:07.670
I've always wondered
what it would be like,

15:07.670 --> 15:08.803
taking a child's life.

15:10.260 --> 15:12.463
Tell me, do you feel any remorse?

15:15.160 --> 15:17.090
- You wouldn't understand.

15:19.440 --> 15:21.820
- Is it that he will
never be able to grow up,

15:21.820 --> 15:23.420
or just that he was so helpless?

15:28.440 --> 15:30.260
- Get on with it Harris.

15:30.260 --> 15:33.540
- Jack, Jack, Jack, I'm enjoying this.

15:35.923 --> 15:38.563
This kill is going to
be something to cherish.

15:41.160 --> 15:42.093
- Just remember,

15:44.284 --> 15:45.884
you'll be standing here one day.

15:50.580 --> 15:53.660
- You're forgetting, in this game,

15:53.660 --> 15:55.213
there is always a price.

15:57.386 --> 15:59.072
And I'm ready to collect.

16:12.730 --> 16:14.100
- Hello Jack.

16:14.100 --> 16:16.450
- What the hell is going on Hawkins?

16:16.450 --> 16:18.550
- I have to be frank, so listen carefully.

16:22.670 --> 16:23.870
- You have my attention.

16:25.160 --> 16:26.680
- We have been told that Eastwood

16:26.680 --> 16:29.720
has been selling off UK government intel.

16:29.720 --> 16:32.143
We can't have Eastwood
causing anymore damage.

16:33.460 --> 16:34.293
- So,

16:35.760 --> 16:37.560
you want me to kill him?

16:37.560 --> 16:40.050
- You're the best in the firm Jack.

16:40.050 --> 16:42.750
Plus, we can take care of
Amber until the job is done.

16:44.930 --> 16:46.573
You and Amber will be free.

16:49.290 --> 16:51.023
It's time you trust me Jack.

16:54.840 --> 16:56.790
I'm sending a car now to pick up Amber.

17:02.559 --> 17:04.059
Do we have a deal?

17:06.660 --> 17:08.031
- Yes.

17:16.829 --> 17:19.209
- You have 12
hours to take down Eastwood.

17:20.990 --> 17:21.890
- I'll do my best.

17:48.223 --> 17:49.140
- Hello.

17:49.140 --> 17:51.360
- Camila, this is Jack.

17:51.360 --> 17:52.690
No time to explain.

17:52.690 --> 17:54.610
Wake Amber up, pack her bag,

17:54.610 --> 17:56.660
and be ready to leave as soon as you can.

17:58.280 --> 18:00.750
And whatever you do, don't make any calls

18:00.750 --> 18:01.723
or answer the door.

18:02.930 --> 18:04.730
Do you understand?

18:04.730 --> 18:06.110
- Sure.

18:06.110 --> 18:08.973
- Camila, get out
of bed and do it now.

18:19.170 --> 18:20.043
- Wake up Monkey.

18:21.180 --> 18:23.578
Daddy's coming, but we need to get up now.

18:23.578 --> 18:24.777
It's important.

18:24.777 --> 18:29.777
Hurry.

18:47.825 --> 18:50.320
- Hey Monkey, you have to go
and stay with some people.

18:50.320 --> 18:51.240
Take Amber.

18:51.240 --> 18:52.560
You have your things?

18:52.560 --> 18:53.680
- Yeah.

18:53.680 --> 18:55.714
- I know, I'm sorry honey.

18:55.714 --> 18:57.175
- Her things are there.

18:57.175 --> 18:58.533
What the hell is going on?

18:58.533 --> 19:00.670
- You and Amber are going to
go and stay in a safe place.

19:00.670 --> 19:02.444
They'll be here in a minute.

19:02.444 --> 19:04.160
- Who's they?

19:04.160 --> 19:05.550
- The government.

19:05.550 --> 19:06.383
- What?

19:09.164 --> 19:09.997
- Camila.

19:15.730 --> 19:16.573
Grab the bags.

19:27.100 --> 19:29.130
- Let's go, we need to move.

19:29.130 --> 19:29.963
This is for you.

19:31.560 --> 19:33.110
- Agents Gabriel and Tennin are

19:33.110 --> 19:34.697
assigned to security for Amber.

19:35.560 --> 19:38.270
- Sir, Amber and Camila,
they're in safe hands.

19:38.270 --> 19:39.320
- They had better be.

19:40.620 --> 19:42.470
They're loaded and ready to go.

19:42.470 --> 19:43.760
- Good luck Jack.

19:43.760 --> 19:44.927
- We gotta go.

20:36.310 --> 20:38.070
- You took your time.

20:38.070 --> 20:38.903
- You know me.

20:38.903 --> 20:40.650
I don't like to rush.

20:40.650 --> 20:43.320
- Unless you're trying
to cover your tracks.

20:43.320 --> 20:45.510
- It's just business Jack.

20:45.510 --> 20:47.010
- But to do that to me?

20:48.370 --> 20:50.700
- Come on Jack, you should know this game

20:50.700 --> 20:51.793
better than anyone.

20:52.980 --> 20:54.993
- I thought we were living by a code?

20:56.230 --> 20:58.063
- Some codes have to be broken.

21:01.370 --> 21:03.360
- I see you've sent me a message.

21:03.360 --> 21:04.193
- What's that?

21:05.100 --> 21:06.250
- You're scared.

21:07.730 --> 21:09.580
- How do you come to that conclusion?

21:10.820 --> 21:12.463
- Because you sent Katarina.

21:14.150 --> 21:16.200
- You can't beat me Jack.

21:16.200 --> 21:18.030
- How many assassins are you going to send

21:18.030 --> 21:19.513
to stop me coming after you?

21:22.550 --> 21:24.283
- As many as it takes.

22:03.210 --> 22:04.923
- Carter, it's Jack.

22:06.060 --> 22:07.600
I need your help.

22:07.600 --> 22:08.543
No time to talk.

22:09.600 --> 22:11.644
Meet me at Rainbow Gardens in 30 minutes.

22:11.644 --> 22:14.100
- I'll be there.

23:17.523 --> 23:19.094
- Can I help you with anything?

23:19.094 --> 23:20.094
- Not today.

25:30.544 --> 25:32.855
- I thought you were a good shot Jack.

25:45.380 --> 25:47.940
Come on Jack, I thought
you were better than that.

26:57.943 --> 27:00.723
Eastwood's not going to
stop sending us Jack.

27:46.640 --> 27:50.120
- Good timing, they're just
coming into the office now.

27:50.120 --> 27:51.620
- I'd like to speak to Camila.

27:53.120 --> 27:53.953
- Camila.

27:54.970 --> 27:55.870
Jack on the phone.

28:01.250 --> 28:02.230
- Mr. Jack.

28:02.230 --> 28:03.490
- Is Amber okay?

28:03.490 --> 28:05.090
- Yes, she's with me.

28:05.090 --> 28:07.890
- Promise me never to
let her out of your sight.

28:07.890 --> 28:08.793
- Okay, I will.

28:13.570 --> 28:15.210
- Hawkins.

28:15.210 --> 28:16.950
- They're here and they're safe

28:16.950 --> 28:18.010
and they'll stay that way.

28:18.010 --> 28:19.053
You have my word.

28:20.550 --> 28:22.100
- Let me speak to Amber.

28:23.900 --> 28:25.100
- I'll take you through.

28:28.020 --> 28:30.320
Amber, your father would
like to speak to you.

28:33.840 --> 28:34.940
- Are you okay?

28:36.420 --> 28:39.313
Okay Monkey, is Camila close by?

28:43.420 --> 28:46.040
I want you to stay with her at all times.

28:46.040 --> 28:47.190
Can you do that for me?

28:50.500 --> 28:53.950
I know it's strange, and
there's a lot going on,

28:53.950 --> 28:56.210
but everything's going to be okay.

28:56.210 --> 28:57.043
You're safe.

28:59.840 --> 29:00.740
- Can't she speak?

29:02.440 --> 29:03.640
- She hasn't said a word

29:03.640 --> 29:05.473
since her mother passed away.

29:16.900 --> 29:19.443
- I have Gabriel and Tennin on her 24/7.

29:20.280 --> 29:22.420
Get me Eastwood Jack.

29:22.420 --> 29:24.020
- I've already started.

29:24.020 --> 29:25.350
- Good.

29:25.350 --> 29:28.080
- How much intel
does Eastwood know?

29:28.080 --> 29:29.100
- Enough.

29:29.100 --> 29:32.220
It's who he's selling it
to that's of concern to us.

29:32.220 --> 29:34.160
- Eastwood knows
I'm working for you.

29:34.160 --> 29:35.720
- I never said it would be easy.

29:35.720 --> 29:37.230
Keep moving.

29:37.230 --> 29:38.673
- I'll keep you posted.

30:03.006 --> 30:03.839
Carter.

30:07.480 --> 30:09.293
- It's been a while since we met here.

30:13.960 --> 30:15.023
- It's still secure.

30:17.850 --> 30:19.217
- It's good to see you.

30:19.217 --> 30:20.883
I know it's not a social visit.

30:25.960 --> 30:26.883
- I need a favor.

30:31.070 --> 30:32.120
- What have you done?

30:35.430 --> 30:38.483
- I need locations of
all of Eastwood's agents.

30:43.310 --> 30:44.223
- So it is true?

30:46.780 --> 30:47.613
- Hawkins.

30:49.140 --> 30:50.533
She's my only way out.

30:53.290 --> 30:54.390
- You haven't changed.

30:57.430 --> 30:58.780
Any idea where Eastwood is?

31:00.560 --> 31:02.410
- I'm going to see someone who might.

31:07.560 --> 31:08.460
- Watch your back.

31:10.590 --> 31:11.540
I'll do what I can.

31:12.710 --> 31:13.660
- Thank you Carter.

31:20.230 --> 31:21.063
- Hey.

31:26.980 --> 31:27.813
Take care.

32:13.550 --> 32:15.300
- Which added services you require?

32:16.470 --> 32:17.570
- You know which kind?

32:19.780 --> 32:20.613
- Jack?

32:23.460 --> 32:24.293
Where and when?

32:27.320 --> 32:30.903
- If you want me, meet me in
10 minutes at the rooftop.

32:34.500 --> 32:36.460
You always are the best.

33:09.877 --> 33:11.920
- Sorry for the inconvenience.

33:11.920 --> 33:14.515
We have special guests in this week.

33:14.515 --> 33:15.604
- No problem.

33:15.604 --> 33:17.354
Better to be safe than sorry right?

33:36.610 --> 33:37.920
- Have a good day.

33:37.920 --> 33:38.753
- Thank you.

33:56.297 --> 33:58.614
- Sorry for the inconvenience sir.

33:58.614 --> 34:00.164
We're gonna have to search you.

34:07.308 --> 34:08.641
Have a good day.

35:13.457 --> 35:15.124
- Where is Eastwood?

35:25.886 --> 35:26.719
Okay.

36:42.341 --> 36:43.841
Just tell me where he is Chan.

36:49.660 --> 36:50.960
When did you get the call?

36:53.620 --> 36:54.620
- It doesn't matter.

37:33.860 --> 37:35.943
- Jack,
listen, I'm working on it.

37:37.040 --> 37:38.603
- I need them ASAP.

37:41.240 --> 37:44.240
- Locating assassins
is not as easy as you think.

37:46.160 --> 37:47.760
Two seconds, I'll call you back.

38:10.110 --> 38:11.430
- Eyes up.

38:11.430 --> 38:12.923
We know the target's inside.

38:13.990 --> 38:15.490
Lee cover the corner.

38:15.490 --> 38:16.580
- Copy.

38:16.580 --> 38:18.283
- Michaels, take the side entrance.

38:18.283 --> 38:19.610
- Copy.

38:19.610 --> 38:21.480
- Are you there?

38:21.480 --> 38:23.080
The location should be with you.

38:24.300 --> 38:25.133
- Nothing.

38:26.310 --> 38:28.563
- Okay, try now.

38:29.650 --> 38:30.483
- Got it.

38:31.870 --> 38:33.150
Okay, I'll call you back.

38:33.150 --> 38:34.750
- Wait, wait, I'm
still missing two agents.

38:34.750 --> 38:35.810
- I've got eyes on him!

38:35.810 --> 38:36.643
- Go, go, go!

38:37.637 --> 38:38.470
- Gotta go.

38:45.380 --> 38:46.553
- He's heading south.

38:48.845 --> 38:52.345
- Follow him around the corner.

38:54.103 --> 38:55.153
- I have eyes on him.

39:07.205 --> 39:08.372
I've lost him.

39:14.962 --> 39:15.795
Let's split up.

39:15.795 --> 39:16.930
Lee, go high side along.

39:16.930 --> 39:17.763
- Copy.

39:17.763 --> 39:19.198
- Push up two streets and loop back.

39:19.198 --> 39:20.596
- Copy.

39:38.350 --> 39:39.720
- I'm on Bar Street.

39:39.720 --> 39:42.040
Michaels, meet me on Chespire Avenue.

39:42.040 --> 39:42.873
- Copy.

39:45.130 --> 39:46.143
I'm 30 seconds away.

39:48.090 --> 39:50.286
- Lee, follow my border street.

39:50.286 --> 39:51.703
- Copy, en route.

39:58.013 --> 40:01.095
- We've got him surrounded.

40:01.095 --> 40:02.178
I've got him.

40:12.270 --> 40:14.840
- 60 pounds please.

40:14.840 --> 40:16.210
- Lee, go around the back.

40:16.210 --> 40:17.043
- Have fun.

40:19.635 --> 40:21.230
- This way please.

40:21.230 --> 40:22.510
This your first time?

40:26.152 --> 40:28.177
I hope you have a good time here.

40:31.000 --> 40:32.383
Do enjoy yourself.

41:15.432 --> 41:16.265
This way.

41:28.709 --> 41:29.959
- How would you like this?

41:29.959 --> 41:31.658
Fast or slow?

41:31.658 --> 41:33.741
- Slow, very slow.

42:33.933 --> 42:35.313
- Your time is up.

42:53.360 --> 42:54.443
- Shit!

44:47.293 --> 44:48.126
- Hawkins.

44:49.490 --> 44:52.020
- I know about the shooting in the club.

44:52.020 --> 44:54.903
The civilian head count you
left behind is concerning.

44:56.090 --> 44:57.730
- I need to check in with Amber.

44:57.730 --> 44:59.519
- Now is not the time.

44:59.519 --> 45:01.480
- Make time.

45:01.480 --> 45:02.433
- Okay Jack.

45:03.270 --> 45:04.960
Anything on Eastwood.

45:04.960 --> 45:06.950
- No, he's sending every asset

45:06.950 --> 45:08.923
to try and stop me reaching him.

45:10.970 --> 45:12.140
- Is that Jack?

45:12.140 --> 45:13.620
- Yes.

45:13.620 --> 45:15.440
- When are we getting out of here?

45:15.440 --> 45:16.523
- Hopefully soon.

45:17.820 --> 45:18.670
It's your father.

45:23.430 --> 45:24.263
- Hey honey.

45:25.580 --> 45:26.413
You okay?

45:31.600 --> 45:34.380
I promise, you and Camila
will be out of there soon.

45:34.380 --> 45:35.213
Alright?

45:38.970 --> 45:40.870
Just hang in there for the time being.

45:42.740 --> 45:43.673
I love you Monkey.

45:44.760 --> 45:45.593
- Thanks.

45:46.760 --> 45:48.733
To be honest, I expected more by now.

45:50.360 --> 45:52.930
- Why was Santos working for you?

45:52.930 --> 45:54.610
- We had our suspicions about Eastwood

45:54.610 --> 45:56.010
and needed to be sure.

45:56.010 --> 45:59.670
Santos found what we wanted
but you killed him before--

45:59.670 --> 46:00.503
- Go on.

46:01.950 --> 46:03.393
- It's classified Jack.

46:05.150 --> 46:07.480
This conversation is for another time.

46:07.480 --> 46:09.720
- So I'm just another pawn.

46:09.720 --> 46:12.400
- For now, just do what needs to be done

46:12.400 --> 46:14.583
and then Amber gets her father back.

46:16.540 --> 46:18.553
Find Eastwood Jack.

46:27.580 --> 46:28.810
- They're asking for an update.

46:28.810 --> 46:30.542
- I'm working on it.

46:30.542 --> 46:32.459
- Yes ma'am.

47:50.490 --> 47:52.570
- You're causing quite
a wake behind you brother.

47:52.570 --> 47:53.670
- Carter I'm bleeding.

47:56.270 --> 47:57.623
And Bronson's on my tail.

48:00.020 --> 48:00.870
I need a blocker.

48:01.960 --> 48:04.010
I'll be coming out of 400 Street Station.

48:04.860 --> 48:06.110
- I'll be there.

49:23.476 --> 49:27.393
- The next
station is Warren Street.

49:52.589 --> 49:53.887
- What the!

49:53.887 --> 49:54.720
- Shit, I'm sorry.

49:54.720 --> 49:57.553
I'm sorry, I didn't see you there.

50:15.714 --> 50:16.950
- You're in the clear.

50:16.950 --> 50:18.760
You can use your safe
house on Craven Street.

50:18.760 --> 50:19.593
- Thank you.

50:20.480 --> 50:22.440
Any luck locating Eastwood?

50:22.440 --> 50:23.390
- Not yet.

50:24.320 --> 50:26.643
Get yourself off the
streets and call me back.

51:13.747 --> 51:15.800
- You holding up?

51:15.800 --> 51:16.633
- Just about.

51:18.730 --> 51:20.283
I need one last favor.

51:21.555 --> 51:22.388
- It'll have to be.

51:22.388 --> 51:24.520
I got people crawling all
over me at the office.

51:27.520 --> 51:30.303
- Double check what flight Barnes is on.

51:31.420 --> 51:34.400
- Checking now, checking now.

51:34.400 --> 51:35.610
What's on your mind?

51:35.610 --> 51:38.290
- Something is not quite right.

51:38.290 --> 51:39.340
- And Amber?

51:40.460 --> 51:41.880
- She's okay.

51:41.880 --> 51:42.960
- You said that, but what if,

51:42.960 --> 51:44.360
and I'm just saying what if.

51:46.800 --> 51:47.963
- She's with Hawkins.

51:50.610 --> 51:51.820
- You're not gonna believe this.

51:51.820 --> 51:53.470
Barnes got on the earlier flight.

51:57.060 --> 51:59.540
- Barnes is helping
Eastwood sell all the intel.

51:59.540 --> 52:01.030
- Sure?

52:01.030 --> 52:01.863
- Yeah.

52:02.797 --> 52:04.547
- Good luck.

53:02.520 --> 53:03.687
- I'm in here.

53:16.430 --> 53:17.433
No one else is here.

53:26.701 --> 53:30.118
If you're looking for Eastwood he's gone.

53:33.430 --> 53:34.263
- Where?

53:36.770 --> 53:37.920
- I don't care anymore.

53:42.640 --> 53:43.590
- What do you mean?

53:48.320 --> 53:49.183
- It's finished.

53:51.800 --> 53:52.633
I'm done.

53:56.044 --> 53:59.127
- You're not making any sense.

54:00.154 --> 54:01.433
- That's my point.

54:05.760 --> 54:07.723
None of this makes any sense.

54:10.960 --> 54:12.623
Why do we even do this?

54:25.260 --> 54:26.510
- That's a good question.

54:34.960 --> 54:36.310
- Amber's not safe anymore.

54:37.210 --> 54:38.043
- What?

54:40.500 --> 54:43.200
- You're the only one capable
of taking down Eastwood.

54:49.010 --> 54:50.910
- Just tell me what's going on.

54:51.980 --> 54:53.273
I know Amber's safe.

54:55.510 --> 54:57.770
- Everything
you need is in here.

56:39.680 --> 56:41.263
- Come on, come on.

56:44.528 --> 56:45.945
Pick up, pick up.

56:47.003 --> 56:49.061
- You really need to make sure.

56:49.061 --> 56:50.504
Can you give me two minutes?

56:50.504 --> 56:51.921
- Yes.

57:09.049 --> 57:11.013
- Come with us, we need to
move to a different room.

57:19.308 --> 57:22.641
- Don't worry honey, it's gonna be fine.

57:28.930 --> 57:29.830
Where are you taking us?

57:29.830 --> 57:31.547
- Just to another room.

58:21.684 --> 58:23.851
- Where the hell are they?

58:27.825 --> 58:29.866
Where the hell are they!

58:29.866 --> 58:32.177
Make the call, lock down the building.

58:32.177 --> 58:33.930
Find me those girls!

58:33.930 --> 58:35.751
- I'm on it.

58:35.751 --> 58:37.751
- Lockdown the building.

58:54.793 --> 58:55.678
- Stop, stop!

59:10.820 --> 59:11.870
- Tennin's down.

59:11.870 --> 59:13.010
Gabriel was seen fleeing the scene

59:13.010 --> 59:15.249
in an SUV with Amber in hand.

59:15.249 --> 59:16.877
- Get me eyes on that SUV.

59:16.877 --> 59:17.877
- Yes ma'am.

59:35.745 --> 59:37.200
- Get Amber and Camila out of there.

59:37.200 --> 59:38.940
They're going to take Amber.

59:38.940 --> 59:41.730
Gabriel and Tennin are
working for Eastwood.

59:41.730 --> 59:42.563
- Jack--

59:42.563 --> 59:43.657
- Do it now.

59:47.340 --> 59:50.080
- Jack, they're already gone.

59:50.080 --> 59:51.140
I'm sorry.

59:51.140 --> 59:51.973
Jack.

59:53.780 --> 59:54.653
I'm sorry.

59:57.170 --> 59:58.223
I'm sorry Jack.

01:00:00.800 --> 01:00:02.350
- You gave me your word.

01:00:04.540 --> 01:00:06.550
- We're doing our best to locate her.

01:00:09.689 --> 01:00:12.189
- You better pray that you do.

01:01:30.230 --> 01:01:32.990
- Hey buddy, where are you?

01:01:32.990 --> 01:01:33.823
We need to meet.

01:01:35.780 --> 01:01:37.003
- Did you get Barnes?

01:01:38.410 --> 01:01:39.243
- He's down.

01:01:40.490 --> 01:01:42.790
I have some information
I need you to look at.

01:01:43.920 --> 01:01:44.753
- Okay.

01:01:45.780 --> 01:01:46.613
Sure.

01:01:47.930 --> 01:01:49.207
Rainbow Gardens?

01:01:49.207 --> 01:01:51.157
- That's the wrong side of town for me.

01:01:52.410 --> 01:01:53.510
How about Jonah's Bar?

01:01:55.600 --> 01:01:56.433
- Sure.

01:01:57.510 --> 01:01:58.653
I can be there in 15.

01:02:35.669 --> 01:02:36.502
- Don't.

01:02:44.533 --> 01:02:45.763
- This is how it is?

01:02:56.650 --> 01:02:57.663
- How could you?

01:03:02.972 --> 01:03:03.972
- I'm sorry.

01:03:14.910 --> 01:03:16.543
- Why did it have to be you?

01:03:23.920 --> 01:03:26.020
- You've been lying for as long as I have.

01:03:27.890 --> 01:03:29.243
It's hard to really tell the truth.

01:03:33.890 --> 01:03:35.807
Eastwood paid of Gabriel and Tennin.

01:03:38.620 --> 01:03:39.823
Same as he did with me.

01:03:53.290 --> 01:03:55.440
You've been a step
behind this entire time.

01:05:03.710 --> 01:05:06.210
- Where have they taken Amber?

01:05:09.087 --> 01:05:11.063
Just tell me where she is.

01:05:12.860 --> 01:05:14.323
Where have they taken her?

01:05:15.714 --> 01:05:16.714
- I'm sorry.

01:05:30.954 --> 01:05:32.287
- Please Carter.

01:05:45.529 --> 01:05:46.946
- I'm sorry Jack.

01:05:47.896 --> 01:05:48.979
I don't know.

01:05:56.849 --> 01:05:58.016
- You're done.

01:06:27.491 --> 01:06:30.223
- Why do you think Barnes
gave you his phone?

01:06:34.110 --> 01:06:36.393
- I've had enough of your games.

01:07:18.330 --> 01:07:21.120
- Is this all we have?

01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:23.063
- If he comes, we'll know about it.

01:07:24.147 --> 01:07:25.921
This is the best we could
get at short notice.

01:07:30.780 --> 01:07:31.613
It's Jack.

01:07:34.660 --> 01:07:35.560
- Just put him on.

01:07:40.891 --> 01:07:42.691
- Hawkins has played you for a fool.

01:07:44.090 --> 01:07:45.950
- I've seen Barnes phone.

01:07:45.950 --> 01:07:48.060
I know where you are Eastwood.

01:07:48.060 --> 01:07:49.920
And I have the file proving you sold

01:07:49.920 --> 01:07:51.170
all the government intel.

01:07:54.220 --> 01:07:55.247
If this got out--

01:07:56.310 --> 01:07:57.310
- You have the file?

01:07:59.791 --> 01:08:01.091
- And I'm coming to trade.

01:08:12.863 --> 01:08:15.010
- What'd he say?

01:08:15.010 --> 01:08:17.082
- He's coming for the exchange.

01:08:18.560 --> 01:08:19.393
Get momentum.

01:08:42.819 --> 01:08:43.653
- Sorry.

01:09:07.231 --> 01:09:08.064
- Jack's on his way.

01:09:08.064 --> 01:09:09.740
You three, cover the west side.

01:09:09.740 --> 01:09:11.630
North side, alright.

01:09:11.630 --> 01:09:12.462
Let's go.

01:09:48.397 --> 01:09:49.229
- Jack.

01:09:49.229 --> 01:09:50.460
- I'm going to get Amber.

01:09:50.460 --> 01:09:51.948
If you want Eastwood,

01:09:51.948 --> 01:09:53.773
you're going to have to come and get him.

01:09:54.940 --> 01:09:56.470
- I just want to say I'm sorry--

01:09:56.470 --> 01:09:58.430
- It's too late for that now.

01:09:58.430 --> 01:09:59.680
- Jack, wait...

01:10:38.650 --> 01:10:41.650
- Two one, this
is zero sit wrap, over.

01:10:41.650 --> 01:10:43.323
- Two one, nothing to report.

01:10:53.470 --> 01:10:55.700
- Section four,
east side, this is zero.

01:10:55.700 --> 01:10:57.200
- East side clear.

01:10:57.200 --> 01:10:58.100
- Copy, moving on.

01:11:14.605 --> 01:11:19.605
- Three, three.

01:11:23.028 --> 01:11:24.779
- Zero two, this is zero.

01:11:24.779 --> 01:11:26.426
Go up and find three two, over.

01:11:26.426 --> 01:11:29.122
- Copy, on the move.

01:11:38.408 --> 01:11:40.700
- One two,
what's the official patrol?

01:11:40.700 --> 01:11:41.823
To the south side.

01:11:41.823 --> 01:11:43.310
One one zero.

01:11:43.310 --> 01:11:44.143
- All clear.

01:11:45.280 --> 01:11:47.893
- Pull back around
and remain in position one.

01:11:56.670 --> 01:11:57.990
Jack can't be far away.

01:11:57.990 --> 01:11:59.990
Remember, shoot on sight.

01:11:59.990 --> 01:12:02.123
I repeat, shoot on sight.

01:12:38.950 --> 01:12:40.193
All sections stay alert.

01:12:41.150 --> 01:12:43.282
Intel reports Jack's en route.

01:12:43.282 --> 01:12:46.063
Hold your positions and
await further instruction.

01:13:41.418 --> 01:13:42.910
- Charlie team, section three,

01:13:42.910 --> 01:13:44.671
do you see Jack?

01:13:44.671 --> 01:13:47.671
- Charlie team, section three clear.

01:13:58.216 --> 01:13:59.565
- Man down, man down!

01:13:59.565 --> 01:14:00.806
Zero, shots fired!

01:14:00.806 --> 01:14:01.639
Shots fired!

01:14:01.639 --> 01:14:02.560
- I can't see him.

01:14:02.560 --> 01:14:03.486
Where is he?

01:14:08.324 --> 01:14:09.650
- Don't go out.

01:14:09.650 --> 01:14:10.750
What's your positions?

01:14:15.510 --> 01:14:16.533
- Where is he?

01:14:16.533 --> 01:14:17.366
- West side.

01:14:18.640 --> 01:14:20.090
Check all the doors and lock it down.

01:14:20.090 --> 01:14:20.923
- Copy.

01:14:22.430 --> 01:14:23.390
- Come with me.

01:14:36.780 --> 01:14:38.860
- Everyone, hold your fire, take cover.

01:14:38.860 --> 01:14:39.760
- Copy.

01:14:56.780 --> 01:14:59.490
One three to zero, all
other sections are down.

01:14:59.490 --> 01:15:00.910
What are your orders?

01:15:00.910 --> 01:15:02.630
- Focus on the west side of the garden.

01:15:02.630 --> 01:15:04.050
80 feet from the house.

01:15:04.050 --> 01:15:04.883
Stay hidden.

01:15:04.883 --> 01:15:07.043
He has a long-range rifle.

01:15:07.043 --> 01:15:08.543
- Copy.

01:15:13.367 --> 01:15:14.583
- Let's get him on the phone.

01:15:19.070 --> 01:15:19.903
- Make the call.

01:15:22.404 --> 01:15:24.080
- Everyone, hold your fire.

01:15:37.307 --> 01:15:40.450
- Are you going to hand over the file?

01:15:40.450 --> 01:15:42.200
- Are you ready to hand over Amber?

01:15:43.370 --> 01:15:44.750
- Since you took out my men,

01:15:44.750 --> 01:15:46.380
it only seems fair that you come out

01:15:46.380 --> 01:15:47.530
and we do the exchange.

01:15:49.520 --> 01:15:51.270
- So you're just going to let us leave

01:15:51.270 --> 01:15:52.433
once I give it to you?

01:15:55.440 --> 01:15:57.723
- I'm sure we can negotiate Jack.

01:16:00.740 --> 01:16:02.140
- Tell your man to back off.

01:16:12.050 --> 01:16:13.360
- Nobody move.

01:16:13.360 --> 01:16:14.210
Keep cover.

01:16:14.210 --> 01:16:15.360
Let's see what he does.

01:16:19.100 --> 01:16:21.166
- Three one
to zero, shots fired!

01:16:21.166 --> 01:16:22.225
Shots fired!

01:16:25.075 --> 01:16:27.107
Copy, moving in.

01:16:27.107 --> 01:16:28.059
Two bodies down.

01:16:28.059 --> 01:16:33.059
Section two one out.

01:16:38.316 --> 01:16:39.515
- Keep calm.

01:16:39.515 --> 01:16:41.143
Route one, draw him out.

01:16:41.143 --> 01:16:43.201
Zero two, move left.

01:16:43.201 --> 01:16:44.520
- Copy, moving in.

01:16:44.520 --> 01:16:45.552
- Two three move right.

01:16:45.552 --> 01:16:47.025
- Two three, on the move.

01:16:47.025 --> 01:16:48.526
- Two four, push forward.

01:16:48.526 --> 01:16:50.443
- Copy that.

01:16:56.436 --> 01:16:57.363
- Give me cover!

01:16:57.363 --> 01:16:58.759
Flank him right, flank him right!

01:16:58.759 --> 01:17:00.175
Follow me, follow me!

01:17:00.175 --> 01:17:02.099
Flank him left, flank him left!

01:17:02.099 --> 01:17:04.419
- I have one down,
section three, section three!

01:17:06.893 --> 01:17:09.793
- Man down, man
down, section two, section two.

01:17:15.810 --> 01:17:17.500
- Section
two, I'm moving forward.

01:17:17.500 --> 01:17:18.960
We need more men, western perimeter.

01:17:18.960 --> 01:17:20.200
- Hug the tree line.

01:17:20.200 --> 01:17:22.410
Draw him away from the house.

01:17:22.410 --> 01:17:24.210
Take him out while he's in the open.

01:17:29.717 --> 01:17:33.717
- There are
only two of us left boss.

01:18:28.630 --> 01:18:29.463
- It's time.

01:18:32.860 --> 01:18:34.483
Bring me Amber.

01:18:34.483 --> 01:18:35.316
- Okay.

01:18:56.020 --> 01:18:57.353
- Go!

01:18:58.900 --> 01:18:59.733
- Amber run!

01:18:59.733 --> 01:19:00.566
Go!

01:19:05.010 --> 01:19:06.960
- Amber's gone, get me eyes on her now!

01:19:08.380 --> 01:19:10.461
Bring me that girl and don't
come back unless you do!

01:19:10.461 --> 01:19:11.961
- Okay, I'm on it.

01:19:28.720 --> 01:19:30.658
- Those wounds must be slowing you down.

01:20:15.532 --> 01:20:17.865
- It's down here, down here.

01:20:37.474 --> 01:20:38.307
- What's that over there?

01:20:38.307 --> 01:20:39.430
- Stop, stop, it's Amber!

01:21:19.440 --> 01:21:21.500
- I'm sorry you had to
hear that sound Jack.

01:21:21.500 --> 01:21:23.450
I did ask him to bring her back.

01:21:23.450 --> 01:21:24.967
Guess I didn't specify how.

01:22:26.352 --> 01:22:27.863
Shit.

01:22:42.937 --> 01:22:45.883
- If you want me, you
know where to find me.

01:23:24.190 --> 01:23:25.023
- I'm here.

01:23:28.813 --> 01:23:30.143
Come on out Jack.

01:23:42.140 --> 01:23:43.883
I've got to hand it to you Jack.

01:23:48.130 --> 01:23:49.763
You're one stubborn bastard.

01:24:00.990 --> 01:24:01.943
Come on Jack.

01:24:04.430 --> 01:24:05.263
You need help?

01:24:07.350 --> 01:24:08.183
It looks bad.

01:24:15.530 --> 01:24:17.440
You're in pretty bad shape.

01:24:17.440 --> 01:24:19.390
Why don't you just hand over the intel?

01:24:28.040 --> 01:24:30.590
You've been a dead man
since you took out that kid.

01:24:38.228 --> 01:24:42.290
You really have played
straight into Hawkins hands.

01:24:50.140 --> 01:24:52.350
Not a smart move Jack.

01:24:52.350 --> 01:24:53.913
Not a smart move.

01:25:13.080 --> 01:25:13.913
Give it to me.

01:25:20.593 --> 01:25:22.083
- YAnd you're finished.

01:26:00.520 --> 01:26:01.353
- Daddy!

01:26:26.733 --> 01:26:28.900
- Don't be scared darling.

01:26:30.372 --> 01:26:32.955
Everything is going to be okay.

01:26:49.123 --> 01:26:50.923
- I can't have loose ends Jack.

01:26:52.666 --> 01:26:57.666
- No!
