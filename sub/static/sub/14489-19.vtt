Greetings,
Princess Purpleberry.

12:37.633 --> 12:40.678
I am Lord Loquat,
your new neighbor.

12:40.803 --> 12:42.596
You're coming
to live here?

12:42.763 --> 12:44.306
There goes
the purple-hood.

12:45.349 --> 12:47.977
(SHATTERS) You're different,
and I don't like you.

12:48.185 --> 12:51.355
Wait, it doesn't matter
the color of your berries.

12:51.522 --> 12:55.234
After all, it takes two
colors to make a rainbow.

12:55.609 --> 12:59.530
Shucks,lnever thought of it that way.
Sorry, cheddar-head.

13:00.030 --> 13:03.117
ALL: <i>(SINGING) Look up high

13:03.575 --> 13:06.996
<i>Orange and purple

healthy purpleberries.

13:11.125 --> 13:12.126

13:20.759 --> 13:23.887
Mom, why is there orange
in my Purpleberry Puffs?

13:24.096 --> 13:27.057
As an active mom,
I care about these things.

13:27.308 --> 13:29.685
I'll check the box
while you start eating.

13:30.644 --> 13:35.858
Now my sugar-blasted Purpleberry Puffs
have loquat-flavored orangeberries.

13:36.066 --> 13:38.610

on those purpleberries

13:59.923 --> 14:02.968

orangeberries.

14:03.093 --> 14:07.598
Soon I will have an important
part of a complete breakfast.

14:11.060 --> 14:15.606
Oh, no. The Berry Burglar
fired his snowball bomb.

14:18.108 --> 14:20.527
The snow will destroy
the purpleberry crop.

14:22.196 --> 14:25.240
Wait, it's not snow.
It's sugar.

14:25.324 --> 14:27.034
ALL: Yay!

14:28.035 --> 14:31.914
New sugar-frosted, sugar-blasted
Purpleberry Puffs.

14:32.122 --> 14:33.999
You can really
see the sugar.

14:34.124 --> 14:38.253
I don't know which I like
more, original or type two.

on those healthy purpleberries.

14:50.391 --> 14:54.978
But next time, by gosh, I'll get my
hands on those healthy purpleberries.

14:55.312 --> 14:56.397
<i>Bork.</i>

14:57.064 --> 14:59.483
Will the Berry
Burglar never learn?

14:59.650 --> 15:01.819
Probably not, but we did.

15:02.027 --> 15:05.572
We learned that no matter whether
we're purple or orange...

15:05.656 --> 15:08.492
Or new polkaberry.
