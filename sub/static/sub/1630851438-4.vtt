00:06.083 --> 00:08.791
A NETFLIX SERIES

00:13.041 --> 00:14.541
It's a fucking mess.

00:18.250 --> 00:19.083
Shit happens.

00:31.708 --> 00:33.500
Okay.

00:40.291 --> 00:41.166
Here.

01:21.458 --> 01:23.125
I never should have left him.

01:26.500 --> 01:27.958
This is all your fault.

01:32.291 --> 01:33.250
I understand.

01:39.291 --> 01:41.166
I'll text the time and place
for the swap.

01:41.250 --> 01:42.708
Why are you calling me?

01:42.791 --> 01:44.833
I'm the one who's gonna
bring your slut back.

01:44.916 --> 01:46.916
Bring the coke
and the chick who robbed me too.

01:47.000 --> 01:50.500
Mm. No, she's staying.
She doesn't need to come with me.

01:50.583 --> 01:52.458
You'll bring her. Now listen to me.

01:52.541 --> 01:56.625
If you bring any of your men,
then your niece gets a bullet to the head.

02:13.875 --> 02:15.250
Your uncle is good.

02:15.791 --> 02:17.916
You're gonna get to go home,
thanks to him.

02:30.583 --> 02:31.500
You…

02:35.041 --> 02:36.750
You're gonna tell me what you know.

02:48.625 --> 02:51.000
All right, where are you hiding at?

02:51.875 --> 02:53.291
Ah, there you are.

02:56.083 --> 02:58.166
Rest assured, everything looks good.

03:02.666 --> 03:05.500
You must be just shy of 12 weeks.

03:05.583 --> 03:07.916
A bit further along than you thought.

03:09.958 --> 03:11.541
Would you like to know the sex?

03:13.958 --> 03:14.791
I would.

03:15.375 --> 03:17.041
I'm pretty sure it's a girl.

03:23.833 --> 03:26.125
I have a strong heartbeat here.

03:26.208 --> 03:27.083
Want to hear it?

03:28.208 --> 03:29.041
Okay.

04:48.541 --> 04:49.541
Sofia…

04:56.708 --> 04:59.083
I can't believe how much
you look like your mother.

04:59.666 --> 05:01.625
You're just as beautiful as she was.

05:06.458 --> 05:08.125
I never ask you about the past…

05:09.208 --> 05:12.791
but you told me she was pregnant when
she and my father were in that accident.

05:13.291 --> 05:16.666
She wasn't showing but… but yes, she was.

05:16.750 --> 05:20.958
If it had been God's will,
you'd have a baby sister.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.583
Do you know if they had a name picked?

05:25.166 --> 05:26.291
Nellia.

05:26.958 --> 05:27.916
It's a nice name.

05:29.000 --> 05:32.208
Anyway, have you decided?

05:34.416 --> 05:36.041
I can manage money fine…

05:37.583 --> 05:39.208
but I don't know how to make it.

05:39.291 --> 05:42.041
Well, if that's your only concern
about this,

05:42.916 --> 05:44.833
you don't have to worry so much.

05:44.916 --> 05:47.333
I won't leave your side
until you've learned.

06:00.625 --> 06:02.708
Does that mean you'll do it?

06:03.958 --> 06:04.791
Of course.

06:57.416 --> 06:58.875
Motherfucker.

07:02.500 --> 07:03.625
All right, let's go.

07:23.541 --> 07:25.291
On your knees. You too.

07:27.458 --> 07:28.291
On your knees!

08:18.333 --> 08:20.041
The coke's back there in the van.

08:21.250 --> 08:22.750
Tell them to release my niece.

08:44.208 --> 08:45.958
Fucking bitch.

09:00.833 --> 09:02.083
Yeah, it's here.

09:09.250 --> 09:10.291
You know what?

09:12.583 --> 09:13.916
You're dead.

09:48.583 --> 09:50.791
Let's go!

09:52.250 --> 09:54.291
Put your gun--

10:16.791 --> 10:18.958
Shh…

10:24.833 --> 10:26.083
What's your name?

10:27.666 --> 10:28.791
What's your name?

10:28.875 --> 10:29.791
Kévin.

10:29.875 --> 10:32.166
Kévin, take this back to your boss, okay?

10:32.666 --> 10:34.666
And tell him exactly how this went down.

10:36.416 --> 10:38.250
-Okay?
-Okay.

10:38.333 --> 10:39.541
Get out of here.

10:49.416 --> 10:51.541
-What's your name?
-Kévin.

11:19.041 --> 11:20.041
You all right?

11:20.125 --> 11:22.416
Shit!

11:26.250 --> 11:27.125
Shaïnez…

11:27.791 --> 11:30.458
I put some fresh clothes back there
for you if you want to change.

11:30.541 --> 11:31.583
Thank you.

11:32.375 --> 11:33.833
-See you in a bit.
-Take care.

11:35.708 --> 11:36.833
Modi's sister called.

11:36.916 --> 11:38.208
-He's in the hospital.
-What?

11:38.291 --> 11:39.166
He's still alive!

11:39.750 --> 11:41.250
Did the cops bring him there?

11:41.333 --> 11:42.750
No, a taxi found him on the road.

11:43.833 --> 11:45.833
He was, like, five miles from the docks.

11:46.666 --> 11:48.250
How did he get to the hospital?

11:48.333 --> 11:51.375
They don't know. The cops don't even know
he was at the docks.

11:51.458 --> 11:53.833
They just think he got attacked
where they found him.

12:08.666 --> 12:09.666
Sit down.

12:25.666 --> 12:26.500
Smile.

12:29.291 --> 12:31.166
We're together, okay?

12:32.458 --> 12:34.375
I'll go check on Modi.

12:34.458 --> 12:36.125
Can you believe he's in the hospital?

12:58.958 --> 13:00.458
Do you have an appointment?

13:03.541 --> 13:04.750
Go see your father.

13:04.833 --> 13:07.041
He wants to talk about
what happened at the docks.

13:07.125 --> 13:08.166
What are you talking about?

13:58.416 --> 14:00.250
You told me that I could trust you.

14:01.375 --> 14:03.250
You said that you would handle Saber.

14:03.958 --> 14:07.416
You know what that son of a bitch
just took from me? 300 keys of coke.

14:17.208 --> 14:18.916
Don't you ever point a gun at me!

14:20.208 --> 14:21.250
You hear me?

14:22.166 --> 14:24.125
Then you better bring me back my coke.

14:24.208 --> 14:27.041
And tell Saber we didn't miss him earlier.

14:29.458 --> 14:31.541
That was just a warning.

15:30.041 --> 15:31.666
Go ahead. Insult me.

15:33.750 --> 15:35.500
What are you waiting for? Go ahead.

15:38.000 --> 15:39.666
Tell me how disappointed you are.

15:41.375 --> 15:43.208
How could I be disappointed?

15:45.333 --> 15:48.458
Any hopes I had for you
were diminished long ago, Saber.

15:51.250 --> 15:53.375
You know what the hardest part is for me?

15:57.166 --> 15:59.666
I wish I didn't care what you do,

15:59.750 --> 16:01.541
didn't care about what you are,

16:02.833 --> 16:04.416
but I can't somehow.

16:07.916 --> 16:10.625
I can't help
but feel ashamed of you, Saber.

16:12.541 --> 16:14.958
I am ashamed to be your father.

16:16.583 --> 16:19.250
I'll never understand
how you could be my son.

16:20.125 --> 16:22.416
I'll have to clean up your mess
once again.

16:22.500 --> 16:25.000
You're going to give me the coke
you stole from Chris,

16:25.500 --> 16:26.541
and from now on,

16:27.750 --> 16:29.583
if you have anything to tell me,

16:30.291 --> 16:31.916
you'll be going through Sofia.

16:33.875 --> 16:36.166
I don't ever want to see you again.

16:43.250 --> 16:44.541
There's something I need to know.

16:47.958 --> 16:49.166
Did you ever love me?

17:09.750 --> 17:12.250
-Where will you go?
-A suburb in Paris.

17:12.833 --> 17:15.875
A cousin of mine is moving in with
her boyfriend, so her apartment's empty.

17:15.958 --> 17:17.250
She's letting me rent it.

17:18.125 --> 17:19.916
Is there enough room for Milhan?

17:21.500 --> 17:22.875
He'll have his own bedroom.

17:24.500 --> 17:25.916
I'm gonna stay on the couch.

17:27.791 --> 17:29.083
You know what kills me?

17:29.750 --> 17:31.875
I always knew we'd end up like this.

17:37.291 --> 17:39.666
Coralie, look at me.

17:41.875 --> 17:43.208
This wasn't your fault.

17:43.291 --> 17:44.625
This was Saber's fault.

17:46.083 --> 17:47.000
I know.

17:48.666 --> 17:50.458
I blame him for everything.

17:53.416 --> 17:56.083
But please don't hate him
for what I told you.

18:00.250 --> 18:02.333
He won't say it, but he loves you, Sofia.

18:03.958 --> 18:05.458
He loves you more than anyone.

18:06.708 --> 18:08.375
That's why he hid it from you…

18:10.166 --> 18:11.291
about your parents.

18:20.541 --> 18:21.375
I'm pregnant.

18:26.208 --> 18:27.708
Mommy.

18:29.833 --> 18:32.583
Sweetie, can you stay with Grandma?

18:32.666 --> 18:34.625
Come on, honey. Let's leave Mommy alone.

18:38.875 --> 18:42.375
It's a little girl.

18:43.791 --> 18:45.958
-What are you gonna do?
-I'm having her.

18:48.916 --> 18:50.750
But first I'm getting rid of Hassan.

18:52.500 --> 18:55.291
I won't let her grow up
in a world with that monster.

18:56.833 --> 18:59.625
If he finds out about this,
you know he'll kill you, right?

19:08.750 --> 19:09.833
Remember Chris?

19:11.625 --> 19:13.625
Saber stole his 300 kilos of coke.

19:15.708 --> 19:17.708
I'll convince Chris that Hassan took it.

19:19.375 --> 19:21.250
And once I do, he'll kill him for it.

19:22.583 --> 19:24.041
Don't worry about me.

19:30.500 --> 19:34.500
-We did a good job, man. Hey, did good.
-See you. Take care, man.

19:34.583 --> 19:35.625
Yeah.

19:37.583 --> 19:38.416
Hey, guys.

19:39.166 --> 19:41.041
See you. You guys be careful, okay?

19:41.125 --> 19:42.375
-Sure, we will.
-Bye.

19:42.458 --> 19:44.166
-Thanks.
-Yeah.

19:45.083 --> 19:46.166
Don't worry about it.

19:47.041 --> 19:48.458
Your family is my family.

20:01.750 --> 20:02.875
Thanks, man.

20:07.750 --> 20:09.000
You won't miss this?

20:09.083 --> 20:10.000
What's that?

20:10.083 --> 20:11.208
Hanging with me.

20:26.041 --> 20:27.208
Take care of yourself.

20:29.625 --> 20:30.791
And take care of Modi, okay?

20:31.416 --> 20:32.333
I promise.

20:35.916 --> 20:37.875
Hey, I never want
to hear from you again, okay?

20:37.958 --> 20:38.791
Done.

21:25.666 --> 21:27.208
No, that's fine.

21:28.208 --> 21:30.125
Danique will take care of that.

21:30.750 --> 21:32.833
Yeah, that would be fine.

21:33.833 --> 21:35.208
Fine, thank you.

21:36.291 --> 21:38.083
See you soon, my friend.

21:46.625 --> 21:49.458
Do you know what your cousin
did yesterday morning?

21:49.958 --> 21:50.791
No.

21:50.875 --> 21:52.041
He went after Chris.

21:52.625 --> 21:55.125
He stole a fourth shipment of cocaine
at the docks.

21:58.750 --> 22:00.208
It's from our friend in Narcotics.

22:02.083 --> 22:04.958
He identified a girl
who took part in the robbery.

22:05.041 --> 22:06.250
What does all this mean?

22:06.333 --> 22:08.583
Saber was robbed a few days ago.
Eight keys of coke.

22:08.666 --> 22:11.291
This girl was one of the kids
who stole it.

22:11.375 --> 22:12.625
He kidnapped the other

22:12.708 --> 22:15.333
and forced her uncle to hit Chris
to get her back.

22:15.416 --> 22:18.250
The second girl helped steal Chris's coke.

22:18.333 --> 22:21.250
She is the one our friend identified.

22:21.333 --> 22:22.958
Chris made one of the kids talk.

22:23.041 --> 22:25.333
He's in the hospital.
But Chris hasn't made the connection.

22:25.416 --> 22:27.833
For now, they only know
it was a settling of scores.

22:28.416 --> 22:31.000
My idiot son told me everything.

22:31.083 --> 22:33.875
-Where is he?
-Chris already tried to take him out.

22:33.958 --> 22:35.250
He's alive.

22:35.333 --> 22:36.833
And Chris's cocaine?

22:37.541 --> 22:39.750
I asked Danique to go and get it back.

22:40.875 --> 22:42.291
I'll return it all to Chris.

22:43.833 --> 22:46.458
And I'll negotiate
some form of compensation.

22:53.750 --> 22:54.958
What's on your mind?

22:56.041 --> 22:58.041
Returning it could look like
we were culpable.

22:59.291 --> 23:00.458
What do you suggest?

23:13.666 --> 23:14.750
We don't return it.

23:15.875 --> 23:17.375
We deny it all.

23:17.958 --> 23:21.291
We send Saber to Morocco until things
calm down and wipe out any links to us.

23:21.375 --> 23:24.083
Without any proof,
he'll stop accusing us eventually.

23:24.166 --> 23:26.625
That means we would
have to take the kids out too.

23:26.708 --> 23:28.791
And the coke, what happens to it?

23:28.875 --> 23:29.875
We sell it.

23:31.333 --> 23:34.083
In France, for half the price.
It will be done tomorrow.

23:37.458 --> 23:38.833
You want me to see to it?

23:41.500 --> 23:42.500
Are you sure?

23:44.125 --> 23:44.958
Yes, I am.

23:49.041 --> 23:52.250
All right, you deal with Chris,
I'll handle the kids.

24:05.375 --> 24:06.208
Hello, Saber.

24:14.166 --> 24:17.083
Your… your father sent me.

24:18.333 --> 24:19.375
What's this about?

24:21.208 --> 24:22.916
I'm supposed to give you a ticket.

24:24.750 --> 24:25.708
What does that mean?

24:29.541 --> 24:31.333
It's a plane ticket for Casablanca.

24:33.541 --> 24:36.083
Your father wants you
on the first flight out tonight.

24:36.166 --> 24:37.541
What am I gonna do in Casablanca?

24:42.625 --> 24:44.125
I'll take you to the airport.

24:54.416 --> 24:57.791
Brussels and Antwerp are home.
So I'm staying.

25:06.541 --> 25:09.000
-Should I inform your father?
-I'll do it myself.

25:11.500 --> 25:12.333
Hey…

25:14.166 --> 25:15.500
You want something to eat?

25:17.000 --> 25:17.875
Sure.

25:18.958 --> 25:19.875
That'd be nice.

25:21.083 --> 25:22.166
What do you want?

25:22.875 --> 25:23.708
The same as you.

25:29.083 --> 25:29.916
The same.

25:55.750 --> 25:56.583
Hello?

25:56.666 --> 25:57.958
You got the shipment?

25:59.250 --> 26:00.375
Yes.

26:00.458 --> 26:01.291
Where is it now?

26:03.291 --> 26:05.791
Listen carefully.
My uncle asked me to handle this mess.

26:06.625 --> 26:09.125
I'll text you the address,
and you'll deliver it there.

26:09.875 --> 26:11.083
You understand?

26:11.166 --> 26:12.250
Yeah, understood.

26:34.500 --> 26:35.666
Can I get my phone now?

26:38.208 --> 26:39.583
No, I need it.

27:04.541 --> 27:07.625
Mom, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

27:07.708 --> 27:09.500
I'm so sorry.

27:12.291 --> 27:13.333
Forgive me.

27:15.333 --> 27:18.000
I was just so afraid.
I thought I might lose her.

27:19.208 --> 27:20.250
I shouldn't have.

27:21.625 --> 27:22.666
It's no problem.

27:23.416 --> 27:25.333
All that matters is she's back now.

27:26.125 --> 27:27.375
No, it is a problem.

27:28.666 --> 27:31.333
I never should have said
that this was all your fault.

27:31.958 --> 27:34.250
I never should have said
you're the reason that Ilyes died.

27:34.333 --> 27:35.291
No, Anissa.

27:37.125 --> 27:38.000
Just let it be.

27:38.083 --> 27:39.875
No, Mehdi, listen to me.

27:41.000 --> 27:42.500
We both lost him, okay?

27:46.083 --> 27:48.250
I never should have treated you like that.

27:51.333 --> 27:53.083
Thank you.

28:07.916 --> 28:08.750
Excuse me.

28:15.125 --> 28:16.500
You got what you wanted.

28:17.208 --> 28:19.500
If you ever go after my family again,
I'll kill you.

28:19.583 --> 28:22.125
That's my son
you are threatening.

28:24.666 --> 28:26.583
That isn't a threat, it's a warning.

28:26.666 --> 28:28.291
If he tries again, I'll kill him.

28:28.375 --> 28:30.208
Right, I got that.

28:31.166 --> 28:32.583
Tell me, though, please.

28:33.666 --> 28:36.208
How can I make it up to you?

28:36.291 --> 28:38.666
I can't repair
the damage that's been done,

28:38.750 --> 28:41.916
but at the very least
I can offer an apology.

28:42.500 --> 28:45.416
We don't want anything.
Just leave us alone.

28:45.500 --> 28:46.333
Very well.

28:46.416 --> 28:48.833
In that case, we'll leave you alone.

28:49.416 --> 28:52.375
Tell me this… where is she?

28:53.000 --> 28:54.416
Where is who?

28:54.500 --> 28:57.291
The girl who hijacked the trucks
that were leaving the docks.

28:57.375 --> 28:58.958
What do you want with her?

28:59.041 --> 29:02.041
Narcotics has apparently
managed to identify her.

29:02.125 --> 29:03.458
I don't know where she is.

29:04.500 --> 29:06.541
Please don't lie to me.

29:07.125 --> 29:11.083
Neither of us can run the risk
of letting her get arrested.

29:12.166 --> 29:13.291
I don't know where she is.

29:14.416 --> 29:16.291
I see. In that case,

29:16.375 --> 29:20.291
I'll find her myself,
just like that kid in the hospital.

30:34.750 --> 30:36.750
I'm sorry.

30:39.208 --> 30:40.416
It wasn't your fault.

30:45.083 --> 30:46.208
So where's my coke?

30:48.958 --> 30:50.083
Seems my uncle has it.

30:51.541 --> 30:55.333
I thought he'd return it all to you,
but he decided to hold onto it.

30:56.041 --> 30:57.166
Why would he do that?

30:58.250 --> 31:01.916
If he were to give the coke back,
it would be admitting that Saber did it.

31:03.333 --> 31:04.875
And we both know he wouldn't do that.

31:12.791 --> 31:14.041
We're gonna be rich.

31:16.541 --> 31:18.291
You douche.

31:19.333 --> 31:21.666
Even with that thing up your nose,
you're still talking shit.

31:21.750 --> 31:25.416
With everything we just learned,
we're gonna be great robbers.

31:26.250 --> 31:30.083
I can already see myself in Phuket.

31:30.750 --> 31:34.625
-Blunt in my mouth…
-And in a bathing suit, in the sunshine.

31:36.500 --> 31:39.500
So I'm just gonna give up
300 keys of coke? Is that it?

31:39.583 --> 31:42.416
No, I'm going to see that you get it back.

31:43.000 --> 31:44.708
Just give me time to convince him.

31:45.458 --> 31:46.500
And what if you can't?

31:47.500 --> 31:49.208
Then you can sort it out it with him.

31:50.250 --> 31:52.875
You could fight, start a war…

31:52.958 --> 31:55.500
But it'll be between the two of you.

31:58.541 --> 32:00.458
Look, I know that Saber's behind it.

32:02.458 --> 32:05.541
That prick was low enough
to make a bunch of kids do it.

32:06.750 --> 32:07.833
I caught one of them.

32:15.625 --> 32:16.583
Want any water?

32:17.333 --> 32:18.750
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

32:35.750 --> 32:37.041
And now where is he?

32:39.875 --> 32:40.708
The hospital.

32:41.500 --> 32:42.875
I don't kill kids.

33:03.166 --> 33:05.166
No…

33:07.541 --> 33:10.250
You don't have any proof. No witnesses.

34:01.958 --> 34:03.708
What are you doing? Hey!

34:03.791 --> 34:05.708
-Calm down!
-Let go! Let go of me!

34:05.791 --> 34:09.500
I'm gonna kill that bitch!
Let me go! Let me go!

34:09.583 --> 34:11.708
Calm down!

34:44.416 --> 34:46.958
Hurry, come on. Behind me.

35:01.500 --> 35:03.000
And now Modi's dead!

35:04.416 --> 35:06.791
And we aren't doing anything about it!

35:06.875 --> 35:08.708
We can't do anything.
They want to kill you too.

35:08.791 --> 35:10.000
I don't give a shit!

35:13.208 --> 35:16.916
I don't care anymore. I mean it!
I don't care. Let them do it!

35:21.125 --> 35:21.958
What the hell?

35:26.083 --> 35:28.125
You think you're capable
of murdering someone?

36:21.333 --> 36:23.875
I thought you didn't know where she was.

36:24.958 --> 36:26.125
Bring her to me.

36:26.708 --> 36:30.750
Bring me that girl now,
or your family will pay.

36:50.250 --> 36:52.416
Do you think Mehdi
is really upset with us?

36:53.291 --> 36:56.208
No, don't worry about that.
It's all over now.

37:02.708 --> 37:04.916
Please leave a message
after the beep.

37:05.625 --> 37:08.791
Anissa, it's me. Don't leave
the house. I'll be right there.

37:35.750 --> 37:39.708
Stay here, don't go anywhere,
and don't contact anyone until I get back.

37:42.041 --> 37:43.291
It's disgusting.

37:43.375 --> 37:45.208
It's disgusting, but you'll be safe.

37:47.458 --> 37:48.958
You're pissing me off.

38:01.291 --> 38:02.583
Whose bike is that?

38:04.041 --> 38:06.708
Mom, drive! Drive, Mom! Go, go!

38:17.416 --> 38:18.833
What's going on? You know?

38:18.916 --> 38:20.250
Just drive, Mom! Hurry!

38:38.750 --> 38:39.958
Hurry up, Mom! Drive!

38:41.208 --> 38:44.333
Go, go, go, go!

39:54.875 --> 39:56.041
Don't move.

39:59.416 --> 40:00.541
Area's secure.

40:04.041 --> 40:05.208
[officer[ Let's get a move on.
