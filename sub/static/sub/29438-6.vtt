WEBVTT

00:00.914 --> 00:02.794
Previously on The Resident...

00:02.795 --> 00:04.402
You told maintenance about us?

00:04.403 --> 00:06.187
I'm gonna tell everyone!

00:06.188 --> 00:08.101
You are my son and I know you.

00:08.102 --> 00:10.225
And I also know that one
day you will want to meet

00:10.226 --> 00:11.550
your biological mother.

00:11.551 --> 00:13.962
That woman is a stranger
who threw me away.

00:13.963 --> 00:16.131
- I do not want to meet her.
- When you're ready,

00:16.132 --> 00:18.023
- you go see her.
- I want you to meet Cain

00:18.024 --> 00:20.094
and get to know him. I would
just like you to have this man

00:20.095 --> 00:21.663
- as an ally.
- Page me if there's

00:21.664 --> 00:23.355
- any surprises.
- You're not leaving

00:23.356 --> 00:25.284
this man's nerve
function to a third-year.

00:25.285 --> 00:27.051
Get back there and do your job.

00:27.052 --> 00:28.782
You cross lines that
I would never cross.

00:28.783 --> 00:30.040
We are very different people,

00:30.041 --> 00:31.432
and neither of us are ever gonna change.

00:31.433 --> 00:34.224
Five other dialysis patients died.

00:34.225 --> 00:36.527
Whatever killed your
sister, it killed them, too.

00:36.528 --> 00:38.796
One click is all it takes to get

00:38.797 --> 00:41.265
immediate access to the records
of any patient on the drug.

00:41.266 --> 00:42.994
You could be fired for
accessing medical records

00:42.995 --> 00:44.168
for patients that aren't yours.

00:44.169 --> 00:46.679
If we can't get the
answers any other way...

00:46.680 --> 00:48.906
Okay, you got this.
You got it, you got it.

00:48.907 --> 00:50.732
- Hand. Two hand.
- Huh?

00:50.733 --> 00:52.443
- Carpal tunnel?
- Oh, 'cause there's a celebrity

00:52.444 --> 00:54.030
- called "Carpal Tunnel".
- Don't hate.

00:54.031 --> 00:57.026
Think he's giving you something.
He's-he's giving you something.

00:57.027 --> 00:59.116
Uh, me-me. Ceiling?

00:59.117 --> 01:00.216
- Oh...
- Oh, my God.

01:00.217 --> 01:01.484
- Ten seconds!
- Do something different,

01:01.485 --> 01:02.544
- do something different!
- Yeah, okay...

01:02.545 --> 01:04.388
Give me a ceiling.
Give-give me a microphone.

01:04.388 --> 01:05.689
- Give-give me a house!
- Time!

01:05.690 --> 01:07.881
- Give me a break!
- Rick Astley!

01:07.882 --> 01:09.950
- Obviously.
- I'm lost.

01:09.951 --> 01:13.386
"Never gonna give you up".

01:13.387 --> 01:15.088
- Wow.
- I mean, come on.

01:18.125 --> 01:20.126
I'm gonna raise.

01:20.127 --> 01:22.963
Call your 200...

01:22.964 --> 01:24.998
raise you five.

01:25.666 --> 01:27.200
Out.

01:27.201 --> 01:28.201
Can't take the heat, huh?

01:29.570 --> 01:30.838
Call.

01:34.809 --> 01:36.176
Two pair.

01:38.312 --> 01:40.347
Two pair, aces and kings.

01:40.348 --> 01:43.083
Yeah. All right. You're the man, Dr. B.

01:45.820 --> 01:48.622
Let's play some real poker, boys.

01:48.623 --> 01:50.790
$1,000 ante.

01:52.000 --> 01:58.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:06.173 --> 02:07.908
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

02:07.909 --> 02:10.377
Those two seem okay,
after their man-breakup.

02:10.377 --> 02:13.313
- No. Breakup's a bit harsh.
- Conscious uncoupling?

02:13.314 --> 02:15.882
They're just not working
directly together anymore.

02:15.883 --> 02:17.918
Speaking of work, I can't
be in the clinic tomorrow.

02:17.919 --> 02:20.353
Um, do you have a better offer?

02:20.354 --> 02:23.098
I wish. No, I'm working on neuro.

02:23.099 --> 02:24.291
We lost another nurse.

02:24.292 --> 02:26.893
And Red Rock's policies
are not helping at all.

02:26.894 --> 02:28.846
Keep cutting days off, adding shifts,

02:28.847 --> 02:30.194
all these overlapping surgeries...

02:30.195 --> 02:32.699
Yeah, that'll mean more double shifts.

02:32.700 --> 02:35.600
Or triples, if triples were a thing.

02:41.709 --> 02:43.009
What's going on?

02:43.010 --> 02:44.945
E-mail update from the review board.

02:44.946 --> 02:49.516
They are still "working on" my
request for hemopleatin data.

02:49.517 --> 02:51.651
- It's taking too long.
- I know.

02:51.652 --> 02:54.487
The more time, the
more patients could die.

02:54.488 --> 02:56.456
Like Jessie.

03:01.195 --> 03:04.482
I need 20 new celebrity
names from everyone.

03:04.483 --> 03:05.907
Let's go.

03:05.908 --> 03:09.135
Exactly how often will we be
throwing these game nights?

03:09.136 --> 03:11.604
Once a month.

03:11.605 --> 03:13.473
_

03:29.890 --> 03:31.958
Up to you, gentlemen.

03:31.959 --> 03:34.494
All right. I'll-I'll go all in.

03:38.165 --> 03:40.033
Come on. You know I'm out of cash.

03:41.836 --> 03:43.770
What else you got?

03:46.907 --> 03:48.975
Horace Dudley.

03:48.976 --> 03:51.811
- Ortho, 70 years old.
- Keep talking.

03:51.812 --> 03:55.921
In and out every couple of
months for persistent back pain.

03:55.922 --> 03:58.718
X-rays, CTs, MRIs,

03:58.719 --> 04:01.187
nerve conduction studies,
steroid injections.

04:01.188 --> 04:04.090
I've performed multiple
microdiscectomies,

04:04.091 --> 04:06.059
and still he wants more.

04:06.060 --> 04:07.660
You're betting a patient?

04:09.630 --> 04:11.097
Insurance?

04:11.098 --> 04:14.167
Silver hair. Platinum insurance.

04:14.168 --> 04:16.236
I say the pot's right.

04:16.237 --> 04:18.038
What do you got?

04:22.276 --> 04:23.810
Flush to the ace.

04:27.448 --> 04:29.149
It's a good hand.

04:30.084 --> 04:31.284
Not good enough.

04:31.285 --> 04:33.620
Full house, queens over eights.

04:35.990 --> 04:37.510
Sorry about that.

04:39.593 --> 04:42.162
Horace Dudley is now my patient.

04:45.456 --> 04:49.456

04:57.711 --> 05:00.213
Hemopleatin is Chastain's
standard of care

05:00.214 --> 05:01.881
for chronic anemia patients.

05:01.882 --> 05:03.817
Can't change that because of a hunch.

05:03.818 --> 05:06.486
It's more than a hunch, but yes.

05:06.487 --> 05:08.455
That's why we need more evidence.

05:08.456 --> 05:10.123
How long has it been standard?

05:10.124 --> 05:12.225
Since the last administration.

05:12.226 --> 05:15.319
Here. This is every Chastain
patient who's on hemopleatin.

05:15.320 --> 05:16.501
They're all confidential.

05:16.502 --> 05:18.405
Their names are listed,
but you can't get access

05:18.406 --> 05:19.811
to their charts without getting flagged.

05:19.812 --> 05:21.413
You see that's not normal, right?

05:21.414 --> 05:24.816
Conrad, your father's on this list.

05:24.817 --> 05:26.918
He's had blood transfusions

05:26.919 --> 05:28.520
for Crohn's flare-ups.

05:28.521 --> 05:30.522
He must have chronic anemia,

05:30.523 --> 05:33.691
so his GP put him on
hemopleatin to help.

05:33.692 --> 05:35.493
I got a patient.

05:35.494 --> 05:36.753
And if you two get caught

05:36.754 --> 05:39.030
digging into files
you have no access to,

05:39.031 --> 05:40.565
keep my name out of it.

05:42.067 --> 05:43.468
You got to get him off that.

05:43.469 --> 05:45.036
He just got back in town last night.

05:45.037 --> 05:46.095
I'll have him come in.

05:46.096 --> 05:47.739
I'll call some friends
at Atlanta General.

05:47.740 --> 05:48.907
Someone should be able to tell me

05:48.908 --> 05:50.842
if they're using it, too.

05:53.245 --> 05:55.377
If they really appreciated us,

05:55.378 --> 05:57.937
they'd get more nurses, not cookies.

05:57.938 --> 06:00.039
Mm. Mm.

06:02.655 --> 06:04.956
Or at least better cookies. Ugh.

06:06.192 --> 06:07.492
You don't know this about me,

06:07.493 --> 06:09.471
but I make a mean oatmeal raisin.

06:09.472 --> 06:11.030
- Hmm.
- Maybe for next game night.

06:11.031 --> 06:12.189
Yeah, that sounds good.

06:12.190 --> 06:15.049
In fact, maybe we could host.

06:15.050 --> 06:18.143
You know? Maybe we could, um...

06:18.144 --> 06:20.778
move in together and then host.

06:22.508 --> 06:25.210
Honey, I...

06:25.211 --> 06:27.979
I'm just not into living
with a boy before marriage.

06:27.980 --> 06:29.647
I've done that more than once.

06:29.648 --> 06:31.851
- Oh.
- This artist in Paris

06:31.852 --> 06:34.519
and a teacher in Conyers, so...

06:34.520 --> 06:36.387
The one in Paris was way better.

06:36.388 --> 06:39.244
So, I don't know, it's
just not my thing anymore.

06:39.245 --> 06:40.812
Okay?

06:45.664 --> 06:48.399
- Morning, Horace, I'm Dr....
- Dr. Cain.

06:48.400 --> 06:50.034
Yes. Dr. McGill told us

06:50.035 --> 06:52.470
that you'd be taking over Horace's care.

06:52.471 --> 06:54.397
He spoke very highly of you.

06:54.398 --> 06:55.956
Your mug's on the side of the building,

06:55.957 --> 06:58.410
- so you must be the best.
- I can't deny that.

06:58.411 --> 06:59.777
And I'm Nic,

06:59.778 --> 07:01.613
the nurse practitioner on your case.

07:01.614 --> 07:02.930
How are you feeling today, Horace?

07:02.931 --> 07:05.517
Better than before my last surgery,

07:05.518 --> 07:08.152
but worse since my last injection.

07:08.153 --> 07:12.602
His lumbar spinal
fusion, the last epidural.

07:12.603 --> 07:13.861
Those are beautiful.

07:13.862 --> 07:16.094
She keeps busy when we're here.

07:16.095 --> 07:18.396
- We're here a lot.
- So I looked at your scans,

07:18.397 --> 07:19.775
and good news:

07:19.776 --> 07:22.767
all the problems you've had
for decades, I can fix them.

07:24.370 --> 07:26.571
Permanently.

07:33.979 --> 07:35.947
- Where is he?
- Wha... Uh,

07:35.948 --> 07:38.883
Dr. Bell? He is 15 out,

07:38.884 --> 07:40.466
and then he's going straight to PT.

07:40.467 --> 07:42.992
- Thank you, Grayson.
- No problemo.

07:42.993 --> 07:45.855
Do you know anything
about an ortho patient

07:45.856 --> 07:47.363
named Horace Dudley?

07:47.364 --> 07:49.465
Yeah. Yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah.

07:49.466 --> 07:51.100
Cain got him with a baller hand.

07:51.101 --> 07:52.402
Trip-queens over eights.

07:55.239 --> 08:00.343
Dr. Cain won my patient in a poker game?

08:00.344 --> 08:01.844
This man in need of a miracle.

08:01.845 --> 08:03.613
Is this the patient you won in poker?

08:03.614 --> 08:05.515
Yeah, that's correct.

08:05.516 --> 08:08.017
Now, look at the degeneration
of the discs. No wonder

08:08.018 --> 08:10.053
- he's been in and out of here for years.
- Yeah, so what's your plan?

08:10.054 --> 08:11.621
Cervical spinal fusions?

08:11.622 --> 08:13.623
If I wanted to go the
ordinary route, yeah, sure.

08:13.624 --> 08:15.425
But I'm not ordinary.

08:17.061 --> 08:19.629
Artificial disc surgery.

08:19.630 --> 08:21.264
But not just one.

08:21.265 --> 08:23.566
I'm gonna replace all
four of the affected discs.

08:23.567 --> 08:25.234
What, a four-level disc replacement?

08:25.235 --> 08:27.337
- Has that ever been done?
- Not in the United States.

08:27.338 --> 08:32.107
So when I'm done, Horace
Dudley will have a bionic spine.

08:32.109 --> 08:34.365
There are no U.S. studies
on long-term outcomes

08:34.366 --> 08:36.479
for multiple artificial discs.

08:36.480 --> 08:39.048
Every study needs a first patient.

08:39.049 --> 08:41.049
Horace Dudley will be that patient.

08:41.051 --> 08:43.424
Well, great. I'll just need
to see the overseas data

08:43.426 --> 08:45.027
before I can sign off on the surgery.

08:47.057 --> 08:49.792
Sure. I'll send them right now.

08:57.155 --> 08:58.655
_

09:00.886 --> 09:04.186
_

09:45.082 --> 09:48.384
Oh. Mm.

09:58.595 --> 09:59.929
Dr. Broome.

10:01.031 --> 10:04.200
Uh... Bonnie.

10:04.201 --> 10:06.402
Please call me that.

10:06.403 --> 10:10.506
I-I know you have a mom, Dr. Austin.

10:10.507 --> 10:11.874
They call him A.J.

10:16.713 --> 10:18.314
So, lunch?

10:29.534 --> 10:31.936
A poker game? Are you kidding me?

10:31.937 --> 10:35.806
- Good morning to you, too.
- No. You can't gloss this over.

10:35.807 --> 10:37.842
This is wrong on every level imaginable.

10:37.843 --> 10:39.610
You gambled a person.

10:39.611 --> 10:41.178
Look, now, hold it. That wasn't me.

10:41.179 --> 10:43.814
A bunch of men drinking,
betting, gambling with a life.

10:43.815 --> 10:46.083
- You're complicit.
- So, what are you actually mad about?

10:46.084 --> 10:49.420
The drinking? The
gambling? Men in general?

10:51.407 --> 10:54.576
Patients are human beings
with needs, not poker chips.

10:54.577 --> 10:56.669
Horace Dudley is my ortho patient

10:56.670 --> 10:58.446
who sometimes makes
the uninformed choice

10:58.447 --> 11:00.014
of finding surgeons to do operations

11:00.015 --> 11:01.583
I've warned him against.

11:01.584 --> 11:03.218
I've been encouraging him to go to PT,

11:03.219 --> 11:05.044
and now, after one night
of Texas hold 'em...

11:05.045 --> 11:06.955
What does it matter how Cain got him?

11:06.956 --> 11:09.736
This is a patient who is
going to go to a neurosurgeon.

11:09.737 --> 11:11.059
He's proved that over and over.

11:11.060 --> 11:13.061
And Cain's as good as
McGill. He's better even.

11:13.062 --> 11:16.297
This is a radical surgery that
might paralyze or kill him.

11:16.298 --> 11:19.200
It's a proven technique; it just
hasn't made its way here yet.

11:19.201 --> 11:22.103
Oh, and because it's Cain,
and he brings in millions,

11:22.104 --> 11:23.905
we have no problem being the first.

11:23.906 --> 11:25.640
Well, somebody has to, you know that.

11:25.641 --> 11:28.076
Forget it. I'm going to the board.

11:28.077 --> 11:30.545
I'll tell them he trades
patients over cards,

11:30.546 --> 11:33.668
publicize his surgical notes,
file a complaint with the AMA.

11:33.669 --> 11:35.250
- No, don't. Don't.
- Why the hell not?

11:35.251 --> 11:38.253
Be-Because this is why
I'm keeping him close.

11:38.254 --> 11:41.356
The board will side with Cain, and he...

11:41.357 --> 11:42.990
he'll destroy you.

11:44.059 --> 11:45.493
I don't want to see that happen.

11:45.494 --> 11:47.662
Thanks for the vote of confidence.

11:47.663 --> 11:49.297
Oh, Kit, come on.

11:49.298 --> 11:52.200
What... Wh-What are you gonna do?

11:56.405 --> 11:58.373
Turn your head all the
way to the left for me.

11:58.374 --> 11:59.741
Stop when you hit pain.

11:59.742 --> 12:01.643
- Uh, uh, r-right there.
- Okay.

12:01.644 --> 12:04.045
- That-that hurts.
- Okay, now go all the way back to the right.

12:04.046 --> 12:05.847
This stops now.

12:05.848 --> 12:08.034
How can I help you, Dr. Voss?

12:08.035 --> 12:10.627
How about you start by
telling your patient the truth?

12:10.628 --> 12:12.391
Horace has already been

12:12.392 --> 12:14.093
fully briefed on his upcoming surgery.

12:14.094 --> 12:16.829
Dr. Cain won you in a poker game.

12:17.843 --> 12:19.544
Excuse me?

12:19.545 --> 12:22.380
Your original neurosurgeon,
Dr. Vince McGill,

12:22.381 --> 12:25.183
ran out of chips, so he
put your name in the pot.

12:25.184 --> 12:27.385
Like betting a car.

12:27.386 --> 12:30.389
Only he bet you, and lost.

12:30.390 --> 12:32.157
Lab extension 2419...

12:32.158 --> 12:33.858
What'd you have?

12:33.859 --> 12:35.736
Full house, queens over eights.

12:35.737 --> 12:38.562
I won 20 grand in Vegas
once, queens over eights.

12:38.563 --> 12:39.988
He thought he had me with a flush.

12:39.989 --> 12:41.714
Of course, he didn't.

12:41.715 --> 12:43.221
I remember one time,
about three months ago,

12:43.222 --> 12:45.470
right, I drew sixes on a big
blind. Flop, nothing.

12:45.471 --> 12:47.071
The river was sweet.

12:47.072 --> 12:48.606
- You know what it was, yeah.
- Yeah.

12:48.607 --> 12:51.442
Thanks for getting here so fast.

12:51.443 --> 12:54.212
Well, when my son summons
me for an ASAP checkup,

12:54.213 --> 12:55.880
I do as I'm told.

12:55.881 --> 12:57.582
How's the device company?

12:57.583 --> 13:00.151
It's never easy to
challenge the status quo,

13:00.152 --> 13:01.753
- but you know that.
- Yeah.

13:01.754 --> 13:03.855
- So, what's going on?
- Hopefully nothing.

13:03.856 --> 13:06.457
I'm just a little concerned
about one of the meds you're on,

13:06.458 --> 13:08.159
so I wanted to check you out.

13:08.160 --> 13:11.629
I feel fine. Couple of
Crohn's flares now and then,

13:11.630 --> 13:13.131
but, uh, the steroids help.

13:13.132 --> 13:14.799
All right, we're just right here.

13:14.800 --> 13:16.768
Leg swelling? Chest pain?

13:16.769 --> 13:18.570
No, none of that.

13:18.571 --> 13:20.305
Breathing okay?

13:20.306 --> 13:22.457
Well, a little shortness
of breath here and there,

13:22.458 --> 13:24.209
but I figure that's age,

13:24.210 --> 13:26.144
plus a little too much
room service on the road.

13:26.145 --> 13:28.713
Okay, I'll do a quick exam down here,

13:28.714 --> 13:32.417
and then we'll run up to CT,
so I can rule out a blood clot.

13:34.520 --> 13:36.187
I missed you.

13:36.188 --> 13:38.423
I missed you, too.

13:39.859 --> 13:42.427
Did I tell you Nic and I got chickens?

13:50.870 --> 13:52.937
Hi, good morning. Hi, I'm Dr. Okafor.

13:52.938 --> 13:54.472
Rosie. This is Lacy.

13:54.473 --> 13:55.874
And...

13:57.376 --> 13:58.877
- I'm sorry, I just...
- You're fine.

13:58.878 --> 14:01.246
Thank you.

14:02.766 --> 14:04.625
I've had to be strong for her, you know.

14:04.626 --> 14:06.317
What are Lacy's symptoms?

14:06.318 --> 14:08.710
She used to be so smart.

14:08.711 --> 14:11.704
All this energy, all these friends.

14:11.705 --> 14:15.026
And now her teachers say
that she's not playing

14:15.027 --> 14:18.129
with anyone at recess, and
she can't keep up in class.

14:18.130 --> 14:20.331
They might hold her back.

14:20.332 --> 14:23.935
A mental disorder wouldn't
cause this kind of lethargy.

14:23.936 --> 14:25.136
I will run some tests,

14:25.137 --> 14:27.639
and then we can see
what we're dealing with.

14:27.640 --> 14:31.709
Um... will it take a long time?

14:31.710 --> 14:33.378
We don't have clinics in Dawson,

14:33.379 --> 14:35.914
and the hospital is so expensive.

14:35.915 --> 14:38.641
I already had to take off a
shift at the diner to drive here.

14:38.642 --> 14:40.618
I was only supposed to take three hours,

14:40.619 --> 14:42.553
and you know traffic
coming into Atlanta.

14:42.554 --> 14:45.256
I will do everything
I can to help you both.

14:45.257 --> 14:46.257
Thanks.

14:50.629 --> 14:53.231
I got to take this. I'll
meet you guys inside.

14:54.400 --> 14:55.667
Yo.

14:55.668 --> 14:57.402
So I have an out if you need one.

14:57.403 --> 15:00.571
Oh, well, that's tempting.
What is the out?

15:00.572 --> 15:03.610
A child with an undiagnosed
condition and heart murmur.

15:03.611 --> 15:06.377
You and Mother of Raptors
could come in for a consult.

15:06.378 --> 15:08.046
Hard pass.

15:08.047 --> 15:10.448
You're just trying to
get a look at my bio mom.

15:10.449 --> 15:13.351
I'm trying to save this family
the expense of an ER visit.

15:15.487 --> 15:17.021
I'll think about it.

15:21.560 --> 15:24.429
I'll be back to you.

15:24.430 --> 15:27.165
Jessica doesn't want to move
in with me unless we're married.

15:27.166 --> 15:29.934
You know she lived with
an artist? In Paris.

15:29.935 --> 15:31.336
I've never even been to Paris.

15:31.337 --> 15:33.237
I'm not sure what
you're looking for here.

15:33.238 --> 15:34.872
Jessica's done all this stuff, right?

15:34.873 --> 15:37.208
She's had real relationships before me.

15:37.209 --> 15:39.010
I haven't. Not really.

15:39.011 --> 15:41.412
You know the one time I
downloaded a dating app,

15:41.413 --> 15:43.381
I was too freaked out to even open it.

15:44.616 --> 15:45.984
Now all I do is pay student loans

15:45.985 --> 15:46.985
and hang out with you.

15:46.986 --> 15:47.986
I'm boring.

15:47.987 --> 15:49.587
I've never even had car sex.

15:50.923 --> 15:52.256
Does an RV count?

15:52.257 --> 15:55.326
Look, Jessica took her
path, you took yours.

15:55.327 --> 15:57.519
They brought you to each other.

15:57.520 --> 15:59.814
Don't let insecurity ruin a good thing.

15:59.815 --> 16:01.399
Okay, Dr. Wisdom.

16:01.400 --> 16:03.134
Okay, no, I know

16:03.135 --> 16:05.703
that I'm not exactly the guy
to give out relationship advice.

16:05.704 --> 16:08.139
The woman I left at
the altar is now dating

16:08.140 --> 16:10.575
some hotshot sportscaster
in San Francisco

16:10.576 --> 16:12.210
while I spend my days with you.

16:12.211 --> 16:15.380
So do as I say, not as I do.

16:16.982 --> 16:18.082
Hi, Mr. Jones.

16:18.083 --> 16:19.550
No, Jonesy, if you would. Please.

16:19.551 --> 16:20.885
Hurt your arm, Jonesy?

16:20.886 --> 16:22.244
Fat Charlie got his revenge.

16:22.245 --> 16:23.988
Was it because you
called him Fat Charlie?

16:23.989 --> 16:26.858
No, no. Fat Charlie is my horse.

16:26.859 --> 16:29.060
I know what you're thinking.

16:29.061 --> 16:31.562
I'm too old to still be
a professional jockey.

16:31.563 --> 16:32.988
My wife tells me every day.

16:32.989 --> 16:34.265
Of course, she's a horse trainer,

16:34.266 --> 16:35.266
so she can work forever.

16:35.267 --> 16:36.501
Is she here yet?

16:36.502 --> 16:38.002
She hasn't checked in.

16:38.003 --> 16:41.072
Preemptive apology if she's
a little much. She worries.

16:41.073 --> 16:43.708
- It's understandable.
- Maybe it's time to quit.

16:43.709 --> 16:46.110
Never.

16:46.111 --> 16:47.812
If I'm not on the back of a horse,

16:47.813 --> 16:49.447
I'm not alive.

16:49.448 --> 16:50.748
You got to fix me up.

16:50.749 --> 16:53.684
Jonesy, you have a fracture
of your distal radius.

16:53.685 --> 16:55.420
See that?

16:55.421 --> 16:58.556
Now, yours is easily treatable
and won't need surgery,

16:58.557 --> 17:01.259
but we're also seeing
signs of low bone density.

17:01.260 --> 17:04.061
We need to run some
tests. Okay? We'll be back.

17:07.299 --> 17:08.965
That's another thing I've never done.

17:08.967 --> 17:11.435
- What, break your arm?
- No, ride a horse. Have you?

17:11.436 --> 17:13.404
Yeah.

17:13.405 --> 17:15.807
See?

17:18.577 --> 17:19.914
Let me guess, third cup?

17:19.915 --> 17:21.806
- Fourth. You?
- Second.

17:21.807 --> 17:23.632
- I need to catch up.
- Mm.

17:23.633 --> 17:24.967
You're not the only one.

17:26.819 --> 17:28.286
- Hey, Cindy.
- Mm?

17:28.287 --> 17:29.520
Wake up.

17:31.056 --> 17:33.691
- What time is it?
- I was gonna say time to prep Cain's OR,

17:33.692 --> 17:35.452
but I don't think you should
be doing that right now.

17:35.453 --> 17:37.344
- It's okay. I'm fine.
- You're exhausted.

17:37.345 --> 17:39.576
Who isn't? We're
overstaffed, underlapped.

17:39.577 --> 17:41.101
Flipped around, upside down.

17:41.102 --> 17:42.527
Sorry, coffee just kicked in.

17:42.528 --> 17:43.986
With all these overlapping surgeries,

17:43.987 --> 17:45.051
they don't think about us.

17:45.052 --> 17:47.451
Nurses and techs... we're
here early to set up the ORs.

17:47.452 --> 17:49.853
And we stay after and make
sure everything is cleaned up.

17:49.854 --> 17:52.074
First in, last out,
from one OR to the next.

17:52.075 --> 17:53.890
All so Red Rock can
schedule more operations

17:53.891 --> 17:54.992
and make more money.

17:54.993 --> 17:56.701
No comment.

17:56.702 --> 17:58.787
But I'm pulling rank.
Go home, get some rest.

17:58.788 --> 17:59.954
I'll look around,
there's got to be someone

17:59.955 --> 18:02.358
- who can swap with you.
- Me. I got you covered.

18:02.359 --> 18:04.475
Jessica, you just finished
back-to-back surgeries, too.

18:04.476 --> 18:07.504
Well, then I'll be in
back-to-back-to-back surgeries.

18:07.505 --> 18:09.172
I may as well ride this second wind.

18:12.176 --> 18:13.977
Okay.

18:15.113 --> 18:16.713
Scalpel.

18:19.951 --> 18:22.085
Retractor.

18:32.697 --> 18:34.297
Curette.

18:40.204 --> 18:42.906
You've hardly spilled a drop of blood.

18:42.907 --> 18:45.108
Anything is possible in my OR.

18:46.244 --> 18:47.645
Disc.

19:06.451 --> 19:07.951
- You okay in there?
- Great.

19:07.952 --> 19:09.620
Like a free nap.

19:11.322 --> 19:14.291
- How's he doing?
- So far so good.

19:15.400 --> 19:16.985
Nice to see you, Marshall.

19:19.130 --> 19:20.897
Okay, I just have a second.

19:20.898 --> 19:22.466
Jessica's covering for Cindy in the OR,

19:22.467 --> 19:25.810
so I'm trying to find someone to
cover for Jessica on the floor.

19:25.811 --> 19:30.073
Anyway, I heard back
from my friend at General.

19:30.074 --> 19:32.276
Hemopleatin patients
have died there, too.

19:32.277 --> 19:35.946
A dialysis patient. Had
a PE just like Jessie.

19:35.947 --> 19:37.314
He had two kids.

19:37.315 --> 19:40.256
We need those records.

19:40.257 --> 19:44.027
And someone in Oncology
who has more access.

19:45.423 --> 19:47.624
I'm gonna try something else.

19:55.860 --> 19:57.394
Do you have any nurses
who can help out in Neuro?

19:57.395 --> 19:58.996
Cain scheduled way
more than we can manage.

19:58.997 --> 20:00.964
Sorry, we're short, too.

20:00.965 --> 20:02.966
Happy freakin' Nurses' Day.

20:05.570 --> 20:06.904
- Hey.
- Hey.

20:06.905 --> 20:09.339
Can I steal you for 30 seconds?

20:09.340 --> 20:10.974
I got 20. What's up?

20:10.975 --> 20:13.810
You did that rotation in Oncology.

20:13.811 --> 20:16.780
Were there any doctors that...

20:16.781 --> 20:19.683
might be willing to
think outside the box?

20:19.684 --> 20:22.019
I'm not sure what you mean.

20:22.020 --> 20:24.521
Conrad and I think there's
a problem with this drug,

20:24.522 --> 20:25.589
hemopleatin.

20:25.590 --> 20:27.024
We're trying to find a doctor

20:27.025 --> 20:28.926
who will share patient outcomes,

20:28.927 --> 20:30.882
- but if we can't...
- You mean open patient records

20:30.883 --> 20:32.262
that aren't yours.

20:32.263 --> 20:35.299
That's an invasion of
privacy, plus it's illegal.

20:35.300 --> 20:36.333
You could be fired.

20:36.334 --> 20:37.935
My sister might have died

20:37.936 --> 20:40.604
because of this drug.

20:40.605 --> 20:43.974
So, honestly, I don't give a damn.

20:46.277 --> 20:49.112
Rules exist for a reason, Nic.

20:49.113 --> 20:50.634
You can't just go break
them because in the moment

20:50.635 --> 20:51.668
you think it's right.

20:52.817 --> 20:54.685
You and Conrad, I love you guys,

20:54.686 --> 20:56.153
but I thought I made myself clear:

20:56.154 --> 20:58.589
I am not going to be
that kind of doctor.

21:05.797 --> 21:08.231
But we'd only been dating a month.

21:08.232 --> 21:09.833
It was more like three weeks.

21:09.834 --> 21:12.202
I can't even say for
sure we were in love.

21:12.203 --> 21:14.671
You were in love, I was in lust.

21:14.672 --> 21:16.473
Let her talk.

21:16.474 --> 21:20.510
Medical school was like a dream.

21:20.511 --> 21:23.046
Full ride, good grades.

21:23.047 --> 21:25.115
I understand. You had priorities.

21:25.116 --> 21:28.403
No. No, not priorities.

21:28.404 --> 21:29.586
That's... No, that's...

21:29.587 --> 21:31.922
Harsh. We were kids.

21:31.923 --> 21:34.160
She could have ended the pregnancy.

21:34.161 --> 21:36.560
Credit us that. We saw it through.

21:38.262 --> 21:42.032
I managed to stay in med school.

21:42.033 --> 21:45.936
I hid the pregnancy from everyone.

21:45.937 --> 21:49.072
And then...

21:49.073 --> 21:51.375
- we...
- Then you gave me away.

21:54.679 --> 21:57.781
There's no judgment
here. Really, there isn't.

21:57.782 --> 21:59.750
But we should at least be honest, right?

21:59.751 --> 22:01.985
I mean, he didn't want
me because he didn't think

22:01.986 --> 22:03.013
I was his.

22:03.014 --> 22:05.746
And then, by the time
I was born, you decided

22:05.747 --> 22:07.524
you were going to be together,
so next thing you know,

22:07.525 --> 22:09.726
you got married and
you had three more kids.

22:09.727 --> 22:13.964
The marriage was fast,
the kids were not.

22:13.965 --> 22:16.399
They came ten years later. It's...

22:17.802 --> 22:21.972
At 22, it wasn't just
Lamar who wasn't ready.

22:21.973 --> 22:24.975
I didn't think I would be a good mother.

22:24.976 --> 22:28.545
I still don't know if I ever was.

22:28.546 --> 22:31.648
But I knew I would be a good doctor.

22:31.649 --> 22:33.350
A really good one.

22:33.351 --> 22:36.241
And it was a time when
there were almost no doctors

22:36.242 --> 22:37.454
who looked like me.

22:37.455 --> 22:39.823
That mattered.

22:39.824 --> 22:42.225
I had a goal, a mission,

22:42.226 --> 22:45.729
something to prove, and I proved it.

22:50.234 --> 22:52.234
_

22:56.937 --> 23:00.363
You know what? Since
you're such a good doctor,

23:00.364 --> 23:02.345
can you do me a favor?

23:02.346 --> 23:04.581
Come with me to a peds consult.

23:04.582 --> 23:06.149
Right now?

23:06.150 --> 23:07.918
Yeah.

23:09.320 --> 23:11.254
Stay.

23:11.255 --> 23:12.255
Eat.

23:24.447 --> 23:26.382
Well, that expression doesn't look like,

23:26.383 --> 23:27.683
"Hey, Dad, you're dying".

23:27.684 --> 23:30.185
Lungs are clear. No blood clots.

23:30.186 --> 23:32.655
Good. Now why don't you tell me

23:32.656 --> 23:34.757
the part you wouldn't tell me before?

23:37.494 --> 23:40.629
The drug you're on, hemopleatin...

23:42.332 --> 23:44.433
... I think it may have
caused Jessie's death.

23:46.269 --> 23:48.404
- Nic knows?
- Yeah.

23:48.405 --> 23:49.438
Not easy.

23:50.840 --> 23:53.886
Right now we only have anecdotal
evidence that it happened.

23:53.887 --> 23:56.312
I need access to a
large sample of patients,

23:56.313 --> 23:58.147
and I can't even get the
data from this hospital.

23:58.148 --> 23:59.581
And I work here.

23:59.582 --> 24:03.552
Conrad, let me in.

24:03.553 --> 24:05.688
Maybe I can help.

24:12.595 --> 24:14.763
- Henrietta.
- Yes, dear?

24:14.764 --> 24:16.699
- What's wrong?
- I can't breathe.

24:16.700 --> 24:18.623
Oh... Somebody help!

24:18.624 --> 24:19.824
Help!

24:21.192 --> 24:23.706
Call a Code Blue, get
me an intubation kit.

24:23.707 --> 24:25.140
What's happening?

24:25.141 --> 24:27.460
His throat is closing.

24:27.461 --> 24:29.653
It's a complication of Cain's surgery.

24:29.654 --> 24:31.588
We need to intubate him.

24:33.783 --> 24:34.850
Hang in there, Horace.

24:45.012 --> 24:46.813
Throat's swollen shut.

24:46.814 --> 24:49.182
- I can't get it in.
- Sat's 70%.

24:49.183 --> 24:51.584
- Did somebody call Cain?
- It went to voice mail.

24:51.585 --> 24:53.986
He's suffocating. We're
out of time. We need an airway.

24:53.987 --> 24:57.056
That's it. We can't wait.
Get me a cric kit now.

24:57.057 --> 24:59.759
Code team's on their way.
Wait, you're gonna cric him?

24:59.760 --> 25:01.627
- Sats?
- 60%.

25:01.628 --> 25:02.862
Then, yeah, I'm cricing him.

25:03.997 --> 25:05.164
Come on, come on, come on.

25:29.857 --> 25:31.257
Trach tube.

25:34.494 --> 25:36.495
We're in.

25:43.470 --> 25:45.538
02 sats are rising.

25:50.844 --> 25:52.378
What in God's name happened here?

25:54.147 --> 25:57.049
This is Cain's patient.
Have you paged him?

25:57.050 --> 25:59.819
Cain signed out. He's not
answering pages, texts,

25:59.820 --> 26:02.188
- carrier pigeons.
- Well, then, wait until you do hear from him.

26:02.189 --> 26:05.148
- If the patient isn't emergent...
- The patient needed to be criced

26:05.149 --> 26:06.659
because of Cain's operation.

26:06.660 --> 26:09.325
- I can fix him now, I'm not waiting.
- Let's just give Cain

26:09.326 --> 26:10.496
a couple of hours.

26:10.497 --> 26:11.956
Because you're worried
about what he'll say

26:11.957 --> 26:13.032
- if I do this.
- No, Kit.

26:13.033 --> 26:15.534
Because I'm worried about
what he will do to you.

26:15.535 --> 26:18.007
It'll be bad for you if you
take one of Cain's patients

26:18.008 --> 26:19.605
to surgery without consulting him.

26:19.606 --> 26:22.441
Horace is my patient now, and I
didn't win him with a card game.

26:22.442 --> 26:25.077
I got him because Cain's
unjustifiable experiment

26:25.078 --> 26:26.913
nearly killed the man.

26:26.914 --> 26:29.582
His life is still in jeopardy,
so I must try and save him.

26:29.583 --> 26:31.250
And I hope to God I can.

26:36.750 --> 26:39.968
It looks like Jonesy has
early-onset osteoporosis.

26:39.969 --> 26:41.710
His chart says he's got celiac.

26:41.711 --> 26:43.491
Low bone density is a common problem.

26:43.492 --> 26:45.760
Not if he's stays gluten-free,
which he says he is.

26:45.761 --> 26:47.661
Mm. He can't keep riding.

26:47.662 --> 26:50.765
Another fall and his bones
could shatter like glass.

26:50.766 --> 26:52.933
Poor guy. We have to break it to him.

26:52.934 --> 26:54.502
Well, at least he got
to have the experience

26:54.503 --> 26:56.804
in the first place.

26:56.805 --> 26:58.589
Wendy Jones?

26:58.590 --> 26:59.590
Right here.

27:02.611 --> 27:04.912
Hi.

27:04.913 --> 27:06.213
- Hi.
- Hi.

27:09.317 --> 27:11.385
- Hey.
- Hey.

27:11.386 --> 27:15.044
- You almost done here?
- Yep, shift's over.

27:15.045 --> 27:17.224
- You want to grab a bite to eat?
- Not quite.

27:17.225 --> 27:18.993
You have a suit?

27:18.994 --> 27:20.728
Uh, I'm not a three-year-old.

27:20.729 --> 27:22.897
- Yeah, I have a suit.
- Great.

27:22.898 --> 27:25.638
Get it, put it on, let's
meet back here in one hour.

27:25.639 --> 27:26.797
I'll text you the details.

27:26.798 --> 27:28.369
Whoa, whoa, wait. Where are we going?

27:28.370 --> 27:30.805
- D.C.
- D.C.?

27:30.806 --> 27:33.207
Yeah. My jet's fueled
up and on the runway.

27:33.208 --> 27:37.645
I think I can get you all of
the data you could ever need.

27:43.652 --> 27:45.419
He said

27:45.420 --> 27:46.787
his stomach hurt and then
he started throwing up.

27:46.788 --> 27:49.056
Dying, hurts like dying.

27:49.057 --> 27:50.825
- Need me?
- Heart rate is 176.

27:50.826 --> 27:51.892
He's in AFib with RVR.

27:51.893 --> 27:53.561
All right, let's get 20 of diltiazem.

27:53.562 --> 27:55.954
Let's get a liter of normal saline

27:55.955 --> 27:58.365
and give four of ondansetron.

28:04.864 --> 28:07.408
Deep breaths.

28:09.678 --> 28:12.079
- That's better.
- Okay, let's get him to CT,

28:12.080 --> 28:13.681
- see what's going on.
- I don't know what happened,

28:13.682 --> 28:15.449
We were sitting here the whole time.

28:15.450 --> 28:16.730
Except for when I went to the...

28:20.689 --> 28:23.490
Open your mouth.

28:25.260 --> 28:27.662
You ate a death cookie.

28:27.663 --> 28:29.330
Jonesy knows he's allergic to gluten.

28:29.331 --> 28:30.598
Yeah, he also knows that eating it

28:30.599 --> 28:33.701
helps him stay on his stupid horse.

28:33.702 --> 28:36.670
Uh, the truth is, I had a cookie.

28:36.671 --> 28:37.671
Hmm.

28:38.573 --> 28:39.940
Three cookies.

28:39.941 --> 28:42.476
So you eat gluten,
flares up your celiac,

28:42.477 --> 28:44.578
and the aftereffects
keep the weight off.

28:44.579 --> 28:46.801
- Hmm.
- Well, look, it's harder

28:46.802 --> 28:48.415
to keep the weight off at my age.

28:48.416 --> 28:50.475
If I get too heavy for
Fat Charlie, then...

28:50.476 --> 28:51.919
You won't be able to ride anymore.

28:51.920 --> 28:54.154
Not professionally.

28:54.155 --> 28:56.156
Except when celiac is
flared, it stops your body

28:56.157 --> 28:58.225
from absorbing nutrients like it should.

28:58.226 --> 28:59.894
That is why your arm broke so easily.

29:02.030 --> 29:03.964
We met at the track.

29:03.965 --> 29:05.900
You fell in love with a jockey.

29:05.901 --> 29:10.237
If I'm not riding anymore, who are we?

29:10.238 --> 29:11.672
Honey.

29:11.673 --> 29:14.308
Sure,

29:14.309 --> 29:17.177
the riding crop and
the cute little pants

29:17.178 --> 29:19.413
and the helmet were what
did it for me at first.

29:19.414 --> 29:24.818
But then, when I fell in
love, I fell in love with you.

29:28.657 --> 29:30.057
Dude.

29:31.593 --> 29:33.627
You've got someone who loves you.

29:33.628 --> 29:34.895
Don't ruin that for something

29:34.896 --> 29:36.497
that doesn't make sense anymore.

29:36.498 --> 29:39.133
It's time to hang up the saddle, Jonesy.

29:41.536 --> 29:43.938
You don't have to
retire the whip, though.

29:43.939 --> 29:45.906
Mama has needs.

29:47.876 --> 29:49.009
I'm out.

29:52.580 --> 29:54.414
Meredith, glasses. Jessica.

29:55.216 --> 29:57.985
Dr. Bell. How's your back doing?

29:57.986 --> 29:59.044
I'm all right, thanks.

29:59.045 --> 30:01.870
We have to figure out what
happened to Cain's poker prize.

30:01.871 --> 30:04.467
Aren't you worried about
angering the great Dr. Cain?

30:04.468 --> 30:07.202
I'm the CEO, so, frankly, no.

30:09.698 --> 30:11.732
I'm here to help.

30:11.733 --> 30:13.033
You figure out what happened?

30:13.034 --> 30:15.669
Retropharyngeal hematoma.

30:15.670 --> 30:17.371
Compressed his airway.

30:17.372 --> 30:19.373
Well.

30:19.374 --> 30:21.408
What have we got here?

30:21.409 --> 30:24.804
One of the manufacturer's
discs was defective. It happens.

30:24.805 --> 30:28.274
Certainly. But it's more likely
with each disc that's inserted.

30:29.951 --> 30:32.987
Taking these out, gonna put 'em back.

30:32.988 --> 30:35.255
Okay, let's-let's start with this one.

30:35.256 --> 30:37.591
She seems nice from here.

30:45.433 --> 30:48.202
Is this normal for Lacy?

30:48.203 --> 30:50.904
No. She's been doing
harder puzzles for years.

30:50.905 --> 30:52.831
Here, let me have it.

30:52.832 --> 30:53.965
It's okay.

30:55.343 --> 30:58.812
- Have you ever seen a cow?
- I saw a baby deer.

30:58.813 --> 31:01.482
- Where?
- I think she means at camp.

31:01.483 --> 31:03.650
Our church took the kids in July.

31:03.651 --> 31:05.786
To North Carolina, in the mountains.

31:05.787 --> 31:07.554
Lacy brought books.

31:07.555 --> 31:09.223
Picture books. She was...

31:09.224 --> 31:11.625
She was good then. She was reading.

31:11.626 --> 31:13.060
She came back like this?

31:13.061 --> 31:14.828
No, she was fine when she got back.

31:14.829 --> 31:17.564
She had a flu. It was rough.

31:17.565 --> 31:20.701
A flu. How long after her return?

31:20.702 --> 31:23.737
Couple of weeks. Had to
miss the first day of school.

31:23.738 --> 31:27.574
The mountains of North Carolina
in July, that is tick season.

31:27.575 --> 31:28.842
Lyme disease.

31:29.944 --> 31:31.612
But she doesn't have a rash.

31:31.613 --> 31:33.347
Sometimes it doesn't show up.

31:33.348 --> 31:36.517
Sometimes it's hidden under the hair.

31:36.518 --> 31:39.186
Lacy, have your bones been hurting?

31:40.939 --> 31:43.097
Lyme is known as "The Great Imitator".

31:43.098 --> 31:45.859
It can mimic virtually any disease.

31:45.860 --> 31:48.595
Untreated, it can also
cause neurological symptoms.

31:48.596 --> 31:51.398
That could be the source of the
cognitive decline you're seeing.

31:51.399 --> 31:54.659
But don't worry, it is
treatable if diagnosed this early.

31:54.660 --> 31:56.325
We'll run a test to confirm,

31:56.326 --> 31:58.439
but if this is Lyme, I am quite certain

31:58.440 --> 32:00.908
we can get Lacy back
to herself in no time.

32:04.746 --> 32:06.106
You hear that, baby?

32:08.383 --> 32:09.716
It's gonna be okay.

32:19.884 --> 32:22.018
There you are.

32:22.019 --> 32:25.422
Whoa. Is this a surprise date night?

32:26.891 --> 32:28.858
Going to a shareholder meeting.

32:30.759 --> 32:32.760
This is a Marshall thing.

32:32.761 --> 32:35.696
He knows the CEO of this
kidney dialysis company in D.C.

32:35.697 --> 32:39.733
They handle 50% of the
renal patients in the U.S.

32:39.734 --> 32:42.626
We're hoping they're gonna let
us take a look at their database

32:42.627 --> 32:44.185
for hemopleatin patients.

32:44.186 --> 32:47.422
You are a rock star.

32:48.276 --> 32:49.910
Who kind of looks like a spy.

32:53.148 --> 32:56.684
Good luck. Let me know how it goes.

33:00.273 --> 33:02.908
Maybe think about wearing that
suit to our next date night.

33:11.015 --> 33:13.517
Can't keep a fireman from the fire.

33:15.203 --> 33:18.105
I was gonna call you.

33:18.106 --> 33:20.407
Dr. Okafor and I agree

33:20.408 --> 33:23.792
that you saved that
little girl from a lifetime

33:23.793 --> 33:25.412
of preventable disabilities.

33:25.413 --> 33:27.982
I'm glad I could help.

33:29.417 --> 33:31.685
You are a good doctor.

33:31.686 --> 33:35.522
You don't think I loved you enough

33:35.523 --> 33:38.359
or wanted you enough,

33:38.360 --> 33:41.128
but how could I? I...

33:41.129 --> 33:44.665
I didn't know what your
adoptive family had named you.

33:44.666 --> 33:48.502
The records were sealed back then.

33:48.503 --> 33:50.537
So...

33:50.538 --> 33:54.108
every time a little
boy came into my office,

33:54.109 --> 33:56.310
if he was the right age...

33:58.613 --> 34:02.249
... and had the right color of skin,

34:02.250 --> 34:05.190
I looked for you in his eyes.

34:05.191 --> 34:07.254
I...

34:07.255 --> 34:09.690
I never stopped looking.

34:13.795 --> 34:15.896
Well, now you can.

34:29.911 --> 34:31.911
Would it be moving too fast

34:31.913 --> 34:34.481
if I invited you to Thanksgiving?

34:35.984 --> 34:37.685
Um...

34:37.686 --> 34:40.454
I spend Thanksgiving with my family.

34:40.455 --> 34:41.855
The one that raised me.

34:42.956 --> 34:44.692
I understand that.

34:45.893 --> 34:48.094
But maybe there's
something we can work out.

34:49.630 --> 34:51.532
No promises, but...

34:51.533 --> 34:54.001
Understood.

34:59.908 --> 35:01.742
Even if this doesn't
work, what you are doing

35:01.743 --> 35:03.944
is above and beyond, so...

35:03.945 --> 35:05.779
thank you.

35:05.780 --> 35:09.216
Well, it's the annual
meeting of one of the top two

35:09.217 --> 35:12.152
dialysis companies in the country, so...

35:12.153 --> 35:14.088
it'll be a blast, right?

35:14.089 --> 35:16.323
Not exactly, but,

35:16.324 --> 35:17.791
hey, if they'll give us the data

35:17.792 --> 35:19.660
on hemopleatin, it'll be well worth it.

35:19.661 --> 35:22.062
How many of these things
have you been to in your life?

35:22.063 --> 35:23.697
Hundreds.

35:23.698 --> 35:26.333
Okay. What's the plan?

35:26.334 --> 35:28.769
Try to stay awake
through the financials.

35:28.770 --> 35:31.939
You'll see. It's so boring,
half the people fall asleep.

35:31.940 --> 35:35.714
When the speeches are over,
we'll find the CEO, Jim DeLoach,

35:35.715 --> 35:37.511
and we'll go from there.

35:45.220 --> 35:49.923
Shareholders of DiaCure,
I present to you our CEO

35:49.924 --> 35:54.762
and the man behind the
miracle, Jim DeLoach!

36:47.749 --> 36:51.494
The DiaCure financial release!

36:51.495 --> 36:53.520
Goliath.

36:53.521 --> 36:54.988
Hey!

37:07.624 --> 37:10.016
And this year,

37:10.017 --> 37:13.507
DiaCure's pretax operating profit was...

37:16.344 --> 37:21.215
$1.2 billion!

37:21.216 --> 37:23.317
Yeah!

37:26.955 --> 37:30.157
Yeah!

37:30.158 --> 37:31.992
So, this is our big data guy.

37:51.532 --> 37:54.801
You saved Horace Dudley's
life and his ability to walk.

37:54.802 --> 37:56.703
Not that we should have
had to do that surgery.

37:56.704 --> 37:59.673
That man had four hockey
pucks shoved in his spine.

37:59.674 --> 38:01.275
Is that what you'll tell the board?

38:01.276 --> 38:03.377
Cain is not one of the good guys.

38:05.913 --> 38:08.115
But if I go to war with him and lose,

38:08.116 --> 38:10.817
I won't be here to fix his mistakes.

38:10.818 --> 38:13.654
I agree completely.

38:13.655 --> 38:16.256
You won't be able to save the
Horace Dudleys of the world.

38:16.257 --> 38:18.292
So I'm not giving up.

38:18.293 --> 38:21.528
I promise you I'm not.

38:21.529 --> 38:24.431
I'm just gonna have to
fight in a different way.

38:36.477 --> 38:38.879
Dr. Cain.

38:38.880 --> 38:40.790
I owe you an explanation.

38:40.791 --> 38:43.283
I assume it's about
how you took my patient

38:43.284 --> 38:45.218
into the OR without my permission.

38:45.219 --> 38:47.888
You were wrong to
perform that operation.

38:47.889 --> 38:50.490
I've heard enough. I'm filing
a complaint with the board.

38:50.491 --> 38:52.826
No, wait, please. Uh, what I mean is,

38:52.827 --> 38:54.928
I believe you were wrong.

38:54.929 --> 38:56.697
That doesn't make it so.

38:56.698 --> 38:59.890
We both have different
approaches to patient care.

38:59.891 --> 39:01.483
We just do.

39:01.484 --> 39:03.879
I can't fault you for leaning
into Red Rock's mandate.

39:03.880 --> 39:05.987
You also can't fault me for doing things

39:05.988 --> 39:07.741
the way I've always done them.

39:07.742 --> 39:11.078
So maybe there's a
way we can keep an eye

39:11.079 --> 39:13.313
on each other's surgical practices...

39:15.750 --> 39:19.019
... while making an extraordinary
amount of money along the way.

39:21.522 --> 39:23.156
What'd you have in mind?

39:23.157 --> 39:25.359
A joint venture.

39:25.360 --> 39:27.694
An ortho-spine surgery center

39:27.695 --> 39:29.429
for comprehensive spine care.

39:29.430 --> 39:32.933
To include neuro and ortho surgery

39:32.934 --> 39:35.135
and physical therapy.

39:35.136 --> 39:38.939
Both quality and quantity of patients.

39:40.936 --> 39:42.470
Agreed.

39:54.856 --> 39:56.823
- Thanks, Jules.
- Mr. DeLoach,

39:56.824 --> 39:59.326
this man says that he knows you.

39:59.327 --> 40:02.429
"Winnie the Winner" Winthrop.

40:02.430 --> 40:05.031
- How you been?
- Fantastic.

40:05.032 --> 40:07.067
You the son? Look
just like your old man.

40:07.068 --> 40:09.403
Conrad Hawkins.

40:09.404 --> 40:13.006
Dr. Conrad Hawkins,
Chastain Park in Atlanta.

40:13.007 --> 40:15.342
No kidding. That's amazing.

40:16.377 --> 40:17.878
So what are you doing here?

40:17.879 --> 40:19.679
Been way too long since the Old Green.

40:19.680 --> 40:21.915
Was a private gentlemen's club in D.C.

40:21.916 --> 40:24.338
It's a hell of a thing you've got here.

40:24.339 --> 40:25.585
A falcon?

40:25.586 --> 40:27.654
Yeah. Always loved the birds.

40:27.655 --> 40:29.322
So, you kids want a drink?

40:29.323 --> 40:31.625
Actually, we need help with something.

40:31.626 --> 40:33.627
Anything for the old Winnie.

40:33.628 --> 40:36.997
Your database. We're doing
a little research on a drug.

40:36.998 --> 40:38.598
Bigger the sample size,

40:38.599 --> 40:40.300
more accurate the data will be.

40:40.301 --> 40:42.669
No problem. It's all yours.

40:44.305 --> 40:46.773
That's-that's great. That's a big help.

40:46.774 --> 40:48.520
Just need a little
something from you fellas.

40:48.521 --> 40:51.044
Little QPQ.

40:51.045 --> 40:52.779
I've had my eye on Chastain for a while.

40:52.780 --> 40:54.514
Big market, lot of promise.

40:54.515 --> 40:59.119
An exclusive with DiaCure renal
services would help us all out.

41:00.621 --> 41:02.989
Think you can make that happen?

41:07.495 --> 41:09.329
Okay.

41:09.330 --> 41:12.432
So, five seconds of action,
and then I'm on the road.

41:17.071 --> 41:18.472
Usually, it's at least ten seconds.

41:18.473 --> 41:19.806
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

41:26.514 --> 41:28.415
- Okay.
- That's it?

41:28.416 --> 41:29.549
Five seconds are up.

41:29.550 --> 41:31.351
- Okay.
- Yeah.

41:31.352 --> 41:34.554
Next time, don't waste it, or
else I'll have to punish you.

41:34.555 --> 41:36.022
- Ooh, a consequence?
- Mm-hmm.

41:36.023 --> 41:38.258
Bring it.

41:44.065 --> 41:46.066
Think he'll be back to the ER?

41:46.067 --> 41:48.602
My guess is, he's done with horses.

41:48.603 --> 41:51.171
Yeah, the next time we see
him, it'll be for a sex injury.

41:51.172 --> 41:53.607
He gets it.

41:53.608 --> 41:55.709
So do I.

41:55.710 --> 41:57.410
Stupid to question the love of your life

41:57.411 --> 42:01.314
for something that's just... stupid.

42:01.315 --> 42:05.185
So Jessica is the love of your life.

42:05.186 --> 42:06.953
Nicely done, man.
