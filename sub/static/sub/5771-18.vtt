02:13.467 --> 02:14.735
MINDY, THE REASON
YOU CAN'T BREAK UP WITH PHIL

DON'T YOU THINK THE REASON
YOU CAN'T BREAK UP WITH PHIL

IS THE BEST YOU CAN DO?

02:29.950 --> 02:32.253

07:01.221 --> 07:03.524
CHEERS.
OKAY.

07:03.557 --> 07:05.526
[gags]

07:05.559 --> 07:07.227
THAT WAS A LOT ON MY FACE.
I'M SO SORRY, I JUST--

07:07.260 --> 07:09.463
I THINK THIS IS--
CAN YOU DRINK THIS?

07:09.497 --> 07:12.232
I SPAT IT OUT
BECAUSE TASTE IT.

07:12.265 --> 07:13.701
IT'S WHISKEY.

07:13.734 --> 07:14.735
I'M VERY SORRY.

07:14.768 --> 07:17.070
BUT NOW WE DRANK
FROM THE SAME CUP.

07:17.104 --> 07:18.706
HEY, DO YOU MIND, UM--

07:18.739 --> 07:19.873
OH, GOD.
I KNOW.

07:19.907 --> 07:20.874
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

07:20.908 --> 07:22.643
I THINK YOU SHOULD THANK ME

07:22.676 --> 07:23.777
FOR SAVING YOU
FROM THAT THING.

07:23.811 --> 07:24.812
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

07:24.845 --> 07:25.979
MAYBE BUY ME A DRINK?

07:26.013 --> 07:28.549
UM, I'M NOT QUITE SURE
WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

07:28.582 --> 07:30.751
I WAS TRYING OUT THIS KIND OF
COOL, NEW AGGRESSIVE WAY

07:30.784 --> 07:32.185
TO HIT ON A GUY.

07:32.219 --> 07:33.987
AND YOU LIKED IT?
NOT REALLY.

07:34.021 --> 07:35.088
FAIR ENOUGH.

07:35.122 --> 07:37.224
I'M VERY SORRY.

07:37.257 --> 07:40.928
I'M NOT GONNA TAKE THAT.
YEAH, I'D LEAVE THAT.

07:42.763 --> 07:43.597
(Mindy)
GREAT, PETER.
HE THINKS I SUCK.

07:43.631 --> 07:44.598
(Peter)
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

07:44.632 --> 07:45.465
(Mindy)
I TOLD YOU HE WAS TOO HOT.

07:45.499 --> 07:46.466
(Peter)
NO, GO BACK THERE.

07:46.500 --> 07:49.236
I SHOULD'VE TOLD HIM
ABOUT MY WORN-OUT PANTIES.

07:49.269 --> 07:51.071
(Peter)
JUST WALK BACK OVER
LIKE A NORMAL PERSON.

07:51.104 --> 07:52.139
FINE, I'LL GO BACK.

07:52.172 --> 07:54.174
GO!
I'LL GO BACK.

07:54.207 --> 07:56.810
HEY.
CAN I APOLOGIZE TO YOU?

07:56.844 --> 07:58.746
HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED
TO ME.

07:58.779 --> 08:00.948
MY HEART WAS BROKEN,
AND IT'S MADE ME

08:00.981 --> 08:04.652
KIND OF WEIRD,
AND THIS IS NOT ME AT MY BEST.

08:04.685 --> 08:06.754
I'M VERY SORRY.
I'M GONNA GO, OKAY?

08:06.787 --> 08:07.788
DON'T GO.
OKAY?

08:07.821 --> 08:09.089
CAN I BUY YOU A DRINK?

08:09.122 --> 08:11.124
ARE YOU SERIOUS?
THANKS.

08:11.158 --> 08:12.593
COOL.

08:12.626 --> 08:13.794
MY MOTHER WAS INSANE,

08:13.827 --> 08:14.662
SO I'M KIND OF ATTRACTED
TO THIS.

08:14.695 --> 08:16.630
NOT THAT I WANT
TO SLEEP WITH MY MOTHER.

08:16.664 --> 08:17.931
THAT WAS WEIRD
HOW THAT CAME OUT.

08:17.965 --> 08:19.767
LOOK, NOW WE'RE AT
THE SAME LEVEL OF EMBARRASSMENT.

08:19.800 --> 08:21.535
BECAUSE IT WAS--AT ONE POINT,
WE WERE AT THE SAME--

08:21.569 --> 08:22.670
PLEASE DON'T DRINK THAT.
[spits]

08:22.703 --> 08:24.638
OH, MY GOD.
ALL RIGHT.

08:24.672 --> 08:26.874
WHEN A GIRL I KNOW
IS TRYING TO MAKE A DECISION,

08:26.907 --> 08:28.308
SHE MAKES
A PRO/CON LIST.

08:28.341 --> 08:29.677
OH, DR. LAHIRI?

08:29.710 --> 08:32.880
UM, RAY RON
HAS NINE TATTOOS.

08:32.913 --> 08:33.914
PRO.

08:33.947 --> 08:35.883
THAT--WE'LL SAY
THAT'S A PRO.

08:35.916 --> 08:37.918
RAY RON WITH ONE PRO.

08:37.951 --> 08:38.919
AND NOW MORGAN.

08:38.952 --> 08:40.721
I REALLY LIKE MORGAN.

08:40.754 --> 08:42.322
HE'S CUTE,
HE'S NICE,

08:42.355 --> 08:43.757
ALL PROS.

08:43.791 --> 08:45.258
NO CONS.

08:45.292 --> 08:47.795
I MEAN, HE'S AN EX-CON,
BUT THAT'S A PRO.

08:47.828 --> 08:49.062
I DON'T KNOW
IF THAT'S--

08:49.096 --> 08:50.731
THAT'S A PRO.
OKAY.

08:50.764 --> 08:51.999
I CHOOSE MORGAN.

08:52.032 --> 08:53.734
WELL, LET ME JUST
SAY SOMETHING ABOUT THAT.

08:53.767 --> 08:55.836
YOU GUYS WORK TOGETHER,
SO, YOU KNOW, LET ME TELL YOU,

08:55.869 --> 08:57.004
THAT NEVER WORKS.

08:57.037 --> 08:59.607
DR. C,
MORGAN CHALLENGES ME

08:59.640 --> 09:01.174
AS A PERSON
AND AS A NURSE.

09:01.208 --> 09:03.110
I DON'T GO, "OH, GOD,"

09:03.143 --> 09:05.245
WHEN PEOPLE HAVE REALLY HIGH
BLOOD PRESSURE ANYMORE.

09:05.278 --> 09:06.847
TRUST ME, YOU DON'T WANT
TO BE CHALLENGED,

09:06.880 --> 09:08.882
ESPECIALLY BY SOMEONE
YOU WORK WITH EVERY DAY.

09:08.916 --> 09:09.883
YOU DON'T WANT THAT.

09:09.917 --> 09:11.151
LOOK, TAMRA,

09:11.184 --> 09:13.186
I THINK RAY RON'S
THE GUY FOR YOU.

09:13.220 --> 09:14.922
I GUESS I NEED
TO THINK ABOUT IT.

09:14.955 --> 09:16.724
YEAH, YOU THINK ABOUT IT.

09:16.757 --> 09:18.692
SO THIS EX-BOYFRIEND
OF YOURS,

09:18.726 --> 09:19.860
YOU MURDERED HIM, RIGHT?

09:19.893 --> 09:21.328
JUST BASED
ON YOUR BEHAVIOR SO FAR.

09:21.361 --> 09:22.763
THIS IS SOMEONE
YOU KILLED.

09:22.796 --> 09:24.698
BELIEVE ME,
I HAVE WANTED TO,

09:24.732 --> 09:26.266
BUT, NO,
NEVER KILLED ANYBODY.

09:26.299 --> 09:27.835
ANY PERSON.

09:27.868 --> 09:30.370
AND BY PERSON,
ARE YOU IMPLYING

09:30.403 --> 09:31.371
THAT YOU'VE KILLED
ANIMALS BEFORE?

09:31.404 --> 09:34.241
NO, I'M NOT LIKE A DEXTER,
LIKE, SERIAL MURDERER.

09:34.274 --> 09:35.843
YOU INSINUATED PERSON,
THOUGH.

09:35.876 --> 09:36.710
[laughing]
YEAH, YEAH, I DID.

09:36.744 --> 09:37.911
THAT WAS WEIRD.

09:37.945 --> 09:39.046
LOOK, I'M HAVING
A REALLY GOOD TIME.

09:39.079 --> 09:41.682
DO YOU WANT--DO YOU WANT
TO CONTINUE THIS SOMEPLACE ELSE?

09:41.715 --> 09:44.051
TO ANOTHER LOCATION?

09:44.084 --> 09:45.719
YEAH, MAYBE, LIKE, MY PLACE.
I DON'T KNOW.

09:45.753 --> 09:47.688
YOUR PLACE.
KIND OF. SURE.

09:47.721 --> 09:49.222
(Mindy)
MY PLACE
HAS JUST BEEN DE-ROACHED.

09:49.256 --> 09:50.223
[cell phone chimes]
I'M SO SORRY.

09:50.257 --> 09:51.792
I JUST GOT A WORK EMAIL.

09:51.825 --> 09:53.260
HOLD ON ONE SECOND.
YEAH. OF COURSE.

09:55.428 --> 09:58.799
[cell phone chimes]

09:58.832 --> 10:00.333
EVERYTHING OKAY?
YES.

10:00.367 --> 10:02.770
UM, I CAN'T
HANG OUT TONIGHT

10:02.803 --> 10:03.837
BECAUSE I HAVE TO GO
TO WORK TOMORROW.

10:03.871 --> 10:05.739
SURE.
THAT'S TOO BAD.

10:05.773 --> 10:07.841
IT WAS REALLY NICE
TALKING TO YOU, MINDY.

10:07.875 --> 10:09.076
I HOPE YOUR HEART MENDS SOON.

10:09.109 --> 10:11.111
THANK YOU.

10:14.715 --> 10:18.018
[cell phone chimes]

10:18.051 --> 10:20.220
HEY, BLOW OFF WHATEVER
YOU'RE DOING TOMORROW.

10:20.253 --> 10:22.189
I'M GOING TO,
AND I TEACH FIRST GRADE.

10:22.222 --> 10:26.159
I LIKE YOU.
WE'RE HANGING OUT.

10:26.193 --> 10:27.394
[mouthing]

10:45.378 --> 10:48.048
GOOD MORN--

10:48.081 --> 10:49.817
LEE?

10:52.085 --> 10:53.253
WAS IT WORTH IT?

10:53.286 --> 10:54.922
WAS IT WORTH
MAKING YOUR ROOMMATE

10:54.955 --> 10:56.356
SLEEP ON THE FIRE ESCAPE,
SO YOU COULD HAVE SEX

10:56.389 --> 10:57.691
WITH SOME RANDOM GUY?

10:57.725 --> 10:58.859
OKAY, YOU ARE
NOT MY ROOMMATE.

10:58.892 --> 11:00.994
YOU ARE MY GUEST
SENT HERE TO PROTECT ME,

11:01.028 --> 11:02.462
AND YOU'VE STAYED HERE
FOR QUITE SOME TIME.

11:02.495 --> 11:03.463
I KNOW.
I'M SORRY.

11:03.496 --> 11:05.966
I JUST WISH THAT HE HAD
SAID GOOD-BYE, YOU KNOW.

11:05.999 --> 11:08.802
WELL, YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE
WITH PROBLEMS.

11:08.836 --> 11:09.903
I THINK TAMRA AND I
ARE DONE.

11:09.937 --> 11:12.172
WE'VE ACTUALLY KIND OF BEEN
HOOKING UP A LITTLE BIT.

11:12.205 --> 11:13.941
OH, MY GOD, MORGAN.

11:13.974 --> 11:16.309
I KNOW, I'VE ALWAYS BEEN
SO INTO BLACK WOMEN.

11:16.343 --> 11:18.078
I USED TO WATCH 227
WHEN I WAS A BOY.

11:18.111 --> 11:20.714
I FELL IN LOVE WITH JACKEE.

11:20.748 --> 11:23.083
HE LEFT HIS SCARF.
GREAT.

11:23.116 --> 11:24.317
DO YOU KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS?

11:24.351 --> 11:26.086
DOES THAT MEAN
I CAN HAVE IT?

11:26.119 --> 11:28.121
NO, IT MEANS
HE WANTS TO SEE ME AGAIN.

11:28.155 --> 11:31.091
OKAY, IT'S JUST...
I NEVER HAD A SCARF.

11:32.826 --> 11:35.095
HEY, DR. C.
HEY.

11:35.128 --> 11:36.496
I WOULD LIKE TO APOLOGIZE.

11:36.529 --> 11:38.999
YOU WILL NEVER SEE ME
KISS TAMRA AGAIN.

11:39.032 --> 11:41.134
NEITHER WILL I,
BECAUSE SHE GOT BACK TOGETHER

11:41.168 --> 11:44.371
WITH HER BOYFRIEND
OF 20 YEARS, REAGAN RONALD.

11:44.404 --> 11:46.807
[sighs]
MORGAN.

11:46.840 --> 11:48.308
MORGAN, I AM SO SORRY.

11:48.341 --> 11:50.010
WE HAD SO MUCH FUN TOGETHER.
YEAH.

11:50.043 --> 11:52.179
PLAYED SCRABBLE,
AND SHE WAS HELPING ME

11:52.212 --> 11:53.046
WITH MY VOCABULARY.

11:53.080 --> 11:55.482
YEAH.
SHE WAS TEACHING YOU TO READ.

11:55.515 --> 11:57.484
WHAT?
WHAT?

11:57.517 --> 11:59.920
I'M A REGISTERED NURSE, DUDE.

11:59.953 --> 12:00.888
YES, OF COURSE YOU KNOW
HOW TO READ.

12:00.921 --> 12:04.124
YOU JUST HAVE
THAT FUN, HUCKLEBERRY FINN,

12:04.157 --> 12:06.193
I-DON'T-KNOW-HOW-TO-READ
ENERGY.

12:06.226 --> 12:09.029
ALL RIGHT.
THAT'S A GOOD SAVE.

12:09.062 --> 12:10.063
LOOK, FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH,

12:10.097 --> 12:13.133
OFFICE ROMANCES,
THEY NEVER WORK.

12:13.166 --> 12:14.301
THEY NEVER WORK.

12:14.334 --> 12:17.771
THEY'RE LIKE FOREIGN CARS.
AM I RIGHT?

12:17.805 --> 12:20.373
I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ANYMORE.

12:20.407 --> 12:22.209
I JUST WANT TO DYE...
WHAT?

12:22.242 --> 12:24.778
MY HAIR BLOND
AND MOVE, I DON'T KNOW,

12:24.812 --> 12:25.879
BACK TO ATLANTA.

12:25.913 --> 12:28.348
IS THERE ANYTHING I CAN DO,
ANYTHING TO CHEER YOU UP?

12:28.381 --> 12:30.117
IF YOU TOOK ME TO LUNCH,
I'D BE THE HAPPIEST GUY

12:30.150 --> 12:31.384
IN THE WORLD,
BUT THAT'S CRAZY.

12:31.418 --> 12:33.386
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
LUNCH IT IS.

12:33.420 --> 12:35.555
ALL RIGHT.
IT'S A DATE.

12:35.588 --> 12:38.225
ALL RIGHT, GREAT.
HEY, MIN.

12:38.258 --> 12:40.493
YOU GOT A SEC?
I GOT SOME PRETTY HOT GOSSIP.

12:40.527 --> 12:43.030
I DON'T, DANNY.
MAYBE LATER?

12:43.063 --> 12:45.032
OKAY.
YOUR LOSS.

12:45.065 --> 12:46.199
REAL SPICY STUFF.

12:46.233 --> 12:48.535
I'M TALKING HABANERO.

12:50.838 --> 12:53.073
HEY, BETS, WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH SPIDERGATE?

12:53.106 --> 12:54.307
WHAT?

12:54.341 --> 12:56.076
NOTHING. NOTHING.

12:56.109 --> 12:59.412
PETER, I HAD SEX
WITH THAT GUY LAST NIGHT.

12:59.446 --> 13:00.413
HEY!

13:00.447 --> 13:02.582
AND WHEN I WOKE UP
IN THE MORNING, HE WAS GONE.

13:02.615 --> 13:05.385
GUYS ARE SUCH JERKS.

13:05.418 --> 13:07.087
BETTER LUCK NEXT TIME, HUH?

13:07.120 --> 13:09.857
WAIT, WHAT?
MORE LIKE BEST LUCK THIS TIME.

13:09.890 --> 13:12.559
'CAUSE, CHECK IT OUT,
HE LEFT THIS AT MY PLACE.

13:12.592 --> 13:15.062
CONGRATULATIONS,
YOU GOT A FREE SCARF?

13:15.095 --> 13:17.497
DON'T YOU THINK YOU WEAR
ENOUGH MEN'S CLOTHING AS IS?

13:17.530 --> 13:18.899
NO, HE LEFT THIS
AT MY PLACE

13:18.932 --> 13:20.167
BECAUSE HE WANTS
TO SEE ME AGAIN.

13:20.200 --> 13:22.169
IT'S A CLASSIC
CINDERELLA MOVE.

13:22.202 --> 13:24.204
I DO THIS TO GUYS I LIKE
ALL THE TIME.

13:24.237 --> 13:26.006
MINDY, YOU GOT
YOUR DIP WICKED.

13:26.039 --> 13:28.108
UGH.
GIVE YOURSELF A HIGH FIVE,

13:28.141 --> 13:30.143
A PAT ON THE BACKSKIS,
AND MOVE ON.

13:30.177 --> 13:32.545
PETER, MAYBE HE'S NOT
A SKETCHO LIKE YOU.

13:32.579 --> 13:33.680
YOU KNOW,
MAYBE HE'S A ROMANTIC.

13:33.713 --> 13:36.149
LOOK, ANY TIME A GUY LEAVES
SOMETHING AT A GIRL'S HOUSE,

13:36.183 --> 13:37.250
IT'S A MISTAKE.

13:37.284 --> 13:38.551
I'M SORRY.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO TELL YOU.

13:38.585 --> 13:42.122
FINE, PETER,
IF YOU FEEL 100% CERTAIN

13:42.155 --> 13:44.257
THAT HE IS NOT TRYING TO SEND ME
A MESSAGE, THEN GOOD.

13:44.291 --> 13:46.326
BUT IF HE BUMPS INTO
FREIDA PINTO AT THE LAUNDROMAT

13:46.359 --> 13:47.127
AND THEY HIT IT OFF,

13:47.160 --> 13:48.561
MAY GOD HAVE MERCY
ON YOUR SOUL.

13:48.595 --> 13:49.562
OKAY, MINDY,

13:49.596 --> 13:50.998
MAYBE YOUR ONE-NIGHT STAND

13:51.031 --> 13:52.132
IS TRYING
TO TRACK YOU DOWN.

13:52.165 --> 13:54.868
MAYBE HE'S THE ONE GUY ON EARTH
THAT'S NOTHING LIKE ME.

13:54.902 --> 13:57.137
AND, YOU KNOW WHAT, PETER,
I HEARD HIS MESSAGE,

13:57.170 --> 13:58.138
AND I'M GONNA FIND HIM.

13:58.171 --> 13:59.206
YOU'LL SEE.

13:59.239 --> 14:00.540
I'LL SEE,
AND YOU'LL SEE.

14:00.573 --> 14:02.209
YOU'LL SEE BECAUSE
YOU'RE COMING WITH ME.

14:02.242 --> 14:04.044
'CAUSE I CAN'T GO FIND HIM
BY MYSELF.

14:04.077 --> 14:05.078
I DON'T WANT
TO GET KILLED.

14:05.112 --> 14:06.179
(Morgan)
DR. C, BEFORE WE GET LUNCH,

14:06.213 --> 14:08.115
I NEED TO CONFRONT SOMEONE
REAL QUICK.

14:08.148 --> 14:09.917
BACK ME UP. BACK ME UP.
BACK ME UP. BACK ME UP.

14:09.950 --> 14:11.051
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
RAY RON.

14:11.084 --> 14:13.120
HI, MORGAN AND DAN.
WHAT UP?

14:13.153 --> 14:14.087
HAPPY EARTH DAY.

14:14.121 --> 14:16.056
YOU HERE FOR THE DISCOUNT
RECYCLED PAPER?

14:16.089 --> 14:17.257
LOOK, RAY RON,
I GOT TO COME CLEAN.

14:17.290 --> 14:18.658
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO DO THIS RIGHT NOW.

14:18.691 --> 14:19.893
I DO.
DON'T DO THIS.

14:19.927 --> 14:20.693
I DO. I DO.

14:20.727 --> 14:22.095
A GENTLEMAN KISSES,
THEN TELLS.

14:22.129 --> 14:24.464
LISTEN, RAY RON...

14:24.497 --> 14:25.498
[clears throat]

14:25.532 --> 14:28.135
TAMRA AND I WERE KISSING

14:28.168 --> 14:30.203
IN A SENSUAL MANNER.

14:30.237 --> 14:32.305
NOW, IF YOU WANT
TO BREAK UP WITH HER

14:32.339 --> 14:34.174
OR YOU WANT TO PUNCH ME
IN THE FACE,

14:34.207 --> 14:35.642
YOU DO IT.

14:35.675 --> 14:36.676
JUST DO IT.

14:36.709 --> 14:38.178
NO, NO, NO.

14:38.211 --> 14:39.679
OH, GOD!
OH, DON'T HIT ME IN THE FACE!

14:39.712 --> 14:41.014
MORGAN, DON'T TRIP.

14:41.048 --> 14:42.182
I MAKE OUT WITH PEOPLE
ALL THE TIME.

14:42.215 --> 14:44.351
AS LONG AS THERE'S
NO 'TRATION, WE GOOD.

14:44.384 --> 14:45.552
OH, MY GOD.

14:45.585 --> 14:46.920
IN FACT,
WE BETTER THAN GOOD.

14:46.954 --> 14:47.787
'CAUSE THIS WHOLE THING

14:47.820 --> 14:49.256
BROUGHT ME AND TAMRA
CLOSER THAN EVER.

14:49.289 --> 14:50.623
OKAY, GREAT, WELL,
I'M GLAD WE GOT THAT CLEARED UP.

14:50.657 --> 14:52.425
MORGAN, WE HAVE THAT RESERVATION
AT THE STEAKHOUSE.

14:52.459 --> 14:54.127
DR. C, DR. C,
I NEED TO THANK YOU.

14:54.161 --> 14:56.063
OH, NO, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO THANK ME FOR ANYTHING.

14:56.096 --> 14:57.397
NO, NO, I DO,
'CAUSE YOU CONVINCED TAMRA

14:57.430 --> 14:59.432
TO STAY WITH ME.

14:59.466 --> 15:01.234
WHAT?

15:02.435 --> 15:03.470
[children laughing]

15:03.503 --> 15:06.039
"THEN MBUTE THE SPIDER
SAID TO AKUNA THE JACKAL,

15:06.073 --> 15:10.143
'I CAN'T FOLLOW YOU.
YOU'RE THE VILLAGE TRICKSTER.'"

15:10.177 --> 15:12.479
LEE, I KNOW THERE'S
NO TALKING DURING STORY TIME,

15:12.512 --> 15:13.613
AND I'M SORRY,

15:13.646 --> 15:16.183
BUT THERE'S A LADY
WAVING AT YOU.

15:18.085 --> 15:19.619
OH, GOD, NOT AGAIN.

15:19.652 --> 15:21.688
HEY, LEE!

15:21.721 --> 15:23.056
HOW'S IT GOING?
WHAT ARE YOU--

15:23.090 --> 15:24.992
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

15:25.025 --> 15:26.994
WELL, I GOT YOUR MESSAGE
LOUD AND CLEAR.

15:27.027 --> 15:28.161
OKAY, IS THAT MY SCARF?

15:28.195 --> 15:29.162
MM-HMM.
I'M GONNA TAKE THAT.

15:29.196 --> 15:30.263
THANKS SO MUCH.

15:30.297 --> 15:31.264
AND WITH THAT SCARF,

15:31.298 --> 15:33.066
YOU WERE SENDING ME
A MESSAGE.

15:33.100 --> 15:35.268
LIKE CINDERELLA,
AND I FOUND YOU.

15:35.302 --> 15:36.369
AND I'M THE PRINCE,
IRONICALLY.

15:36.403 --> 15:38.371
DO YOU KNOW THE STORY
OF CINDERELL--

15:38.405 --> 15:39.439
(Lee)
PLEASE DON'T TALK TO THE KIDS.

15:39.472 --> 15:41.041
YEAH, I THINK
YOU REALLY NEED TO GO.

15:41.074 --> 15:42.309
BUT YOU LEFT IT FOR ME,
SO I'D COME

15:42.342 --> 15:44.644
AND FIND YOU, RIGHT?

15:44.677 --> 15:46.046
DID YOU LEAVE IT
AT HER APARTMENT AS AN ACCIDENT

15:46.079 --> 15:47.347
OR ON PURPOSE?

15:47.380 --> 15:48.748
YEAH, IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

15:48.781 --> 15:50.383
BUT ON SOME LEVEL, LIKE,
YOUR HEART WANTED YOU

15:50.417 --> 15:51.251
TO LEAVE IT THERE,
SO I WOULD--

15:51.284 --> 15:53.220
MY HEART LEFT IT THERE
ACCIDENTALLY.

15:53.253 --> 15:54.287
EVERY PART OF IT
WAS AN ACCIDENT.

15:54.321 --> 15:55.688
YEAH.
OKAY.

15:55.722 --> 15:57.190
OOH, HEY, MINDY.

15:57.224 --> 15:58.291
YOU WANT TO SEE ME AGAIN?

15:58.325 --> 15:59.526
YOU'RE NOT A PARENT HERE,
ARE YOU?

15:59.559 --> 16:01.094
OF ONE OF THE CHILDREN?

16:01.128 --> 16:03.163
'CAUSE SIX STRIKES,
AND I'M OUT.

16:03.196 --> 16:05.432
AM I A PARENT HERE?
OKAY.

16:05.465 --> 16:07.634
DO I LOOK LIKE A PARENT?

16:07.667 --> 16:09.069
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

16:09.102 --> 16:10.503
KIDS, IT'S OKAY.

16:10.537 --> 16:12.139
MAKING LOVE TO A--
THANK YOU FOR TAKING HER AWAY.

16:12.172 --> 16:13.140
WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH YOU?

16:13.173 --> 16:15.208
OKAY.
HUH? WHAT'S--

16:18.645 --> 16:19.746
[school bell rings]
(Peter)
SCREW HIM.

16:19.779 --> 16:20.647
HE'S TOO STUPID
TO TEACH SECOND GRADE.

16:20.680 --> 16:22.382
YOU COULD DO SO MUCH BETTER
THAN HIM.

16:22.415 --> 16:24.584
OR AT LEAST
YOU CAN DO BETTER THAN HIM.

16:24.617 --> 16:26.786
CAN I?
I WASN'T GOOD ENOUGH FOR DANNY.

16:26.819 --> 16:29.456
AND NOW I'M NOT GOOD ENOUGH
FOR THIS GUY?

16:29.489 --> 16:30.690
I DON'T KNOW, PETER,
I THINK I SHOULD JUST GIVE UP

16:30.723 --> 16:32.525
AND DATE THE NEXT MELVIN
THAT ASKS ME OUT.

16:32.559 --> 16:35.262
MY NAME IS MELVIN.

16:35.295 --> 16:37.464
WHAT ARE YOU UP TO TONIGHT?

16:37.497 --> 16:39.632
NOTHING, ACTUALLY.

16:39.666 --> 16:41.134
YOU LIKE STREET FESTIVALS?

16:41.168 --> 16:42.735
KIND OF.
MINDY, COME ON.

16:42.769 --> 16:45.538
WE'RE GOING BACK IN THERE.

16:45.572 --> 16:47.074
HEY, KOTTER,

16:47.107 --> 16:48.275
WE NEED TO TALK.

16:48.308 --> 16:49.676
IT IS DRAWING TIME,
YOU GUYS!

16:49.709 --> 16:52.379
YOU DO NOT INTERRUPT
DRAWING TIME. LET'S GO.

16:52.412 --> 16:54.681
INTERRUPTING DRAWING TIME.
ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MINDS?

16:54.714 --> 16:56.616
NOW I WANT TO HEAR
AN APOLOGY OUT OF YOU,

16:56.649 --> 16:58.051
AND I WANT IT
DIRECTED TO HER.

16:58.085 --> 17:00.287
YOU WANT ME TO APOLOGIZE?
FOR WHAT?
YEAH.

17:00.320 --> 17:01.721
WE WERE BOTH
CONSENTING ADULTS.

17:01.754 --> 17:03.223
IN FACT, I WAS THE ONE
WHO WAS PUSHED

17:03.256 --> 17:05.625
INTO DOING THINGS--
A LOT OF THINGS.

17:05.658 --> 17:08.295
OKAY, DON'T YOU TRY TO ACT
LIKE YOU'RE THE VICTIM.

17:08.328 --> 17:10.363
I WOKE UP TO NOTHING
IN MY BED.

17:10.397 --> 17:11.364
DO YOU KNOW
HOW THAT FELT?

17:11.398 --> 17:13.233
WELL, SOME THINGS,
LIKE A BUNCH OF MAGAZINES,

17:13.266 --> 17:14.667
A COOKIE TIN,
A BOTTLE OF SRIRACHA,

17:14.701 --> 17:15.668
AND A SLEEPING BAG.

17:15.702 --> 17:17.537
MY DIET PILLS,
MY BIRTH CONTROL, BUT NOT YOU.

17:17.570 --> 17:19.339
HOLD ON, YOU KEEP
A SLEEPING BAG IN YOUR BED?

17:19.372 --> 17:20.773
THAT'S REALLY SAD.

17:20.807 --> 17:22.609
I THOUGHT WE HAD SOMETHING.

17:22.642 --> 17:23.776
YOU KNOW, HE PLAYED ME
HIS GUITAR APP.

17:23.810 --> 17:25.612
YOU TOLD ME
THAT YOUR DAD WAS BISEXUAL.

17:25.645 --> 17:27.247
ARE YOU KIDDING?
[scoffs]

17:27.280 --> 17:29.082
YOU SAID
THAT YOU FELT INVINCIBLE.

17:29.116 --> 17:31.718
INVINC--NO, NO, NO.
I SAID "INVISIBLE."

17:31.751 --> 17:33.686
I WAS BURIED UNDER A PILE
OF STUFF ON YOUR BED.

17:33.720 --> 17:35.688
IF THAT'S THE CASE,
THEN I AM SORRY.

17:35.722 --> 17:37.690
NO, MINDY,
YOU DO NOT APOLOGIZE TO HIM.

17:37.724 --> 17:39.626
THIS GUY TOOK ADVANTAGE
OF YOUR HEARTBREAK,

17:39.659 --> 17:41.094
AND THAT IS A LOW MOVE.

17:41.128 --> 17:42.762
THAT IS DISGUSTING.

17:42.795 --> 17:48.135
THAT IS EXACTLY THE THING
THAT I WOULD DO.

17:48.168 --> 17:50.370
AM I A DICK?

17:50.403 --> 17:51.871
DOES EVERYONE THINK
I'M A DICK?

17:51.904 --> 17:53.673
YEAH, ARE YOU
JUST REALIZING THAT NOW?

17:53.706 --> 17:55.708
OH, GOD.

17:55.742 --> 17:57.777
EXCUSE ME.
DO YOU HAVE A HALL PASS?

17:57.810 --> 17:59.312
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT, EDGAR?
THEY'RE FINE.

17:59.346 --> 18:01.148
THEY'RE WITH ME.
OH, MY GOD.

18:01.181 --> 18:02.149
HMM?

18:02.182 --> 18:03.316
IS THAT A WEDDING RING?

18:03.350 --> 18:05.418
IS THIS A--

18:05.452 --> 18:06.619
YOU'RE MARRIED?

18:06.653 --> 18:10.223
[clicks tongue, blows]

18:10.257 --> 18:11.558
WHERE'D IT GO?
NO, NO.

18:11.591 --> 18:12.692
IT'S STILL ON YOUR HAND.
TECHNICALLY,

18:12.725 --> 18:14.727
IT'S A WEDDING BAND,
NOT A RING.

18:14.761 --> 18:16.796
HOW COULD YOU DO THAT?

18:16.829 --> 18:18.498
NOW I'M THE OTHER WOMAN?

18:18.531 --> 18:19.866
THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT
I WAS LISTENING TO LAST NIGHT.

18:19.899 --> 18:20.900
I CAN'T DO THIS AGAIN.

18:20.933 --> 18:22.269
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
THIS IS REALLY--

18:22.302 --> 18:24.237
HEY, HEY, HEY.
OH, MY GOD.

18:24.271 --> 18:26.339
(Danny)
YOU KNOW WHAT, MORGAN,
PUNCH ME IN THE FACE.

18:26.373 --> 18:27.774
AFTER WHAT I DID,
STATEN RULES, COME ON.

18:27.807 --> 18:29.642
ONE FREE POP.
GO AHEAD. DO IT.

18:29.676 --> 18:32.345
I DON'T WANT TO PUNCH YOU
IN THE FACE, DR. CASTELLANO.

18:32.379 --> 18:33.846
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
"DR. CASTELLANO"?

18:33.880 --> 18:35.382
WHAT HAPPENED TO "DR. C"?

18:35.415 --> 18:36.916
JUST BECAUSE WE WORK TOGETHER
DOESN'T MEAN

18:36.949 --> 18:38.718
WE HAVE TO BE FRIENDS,
DR. CASTELLANO.

18:38.751 --> 18:39.886
STOP SAYING THAT.

18:39.919 --> 18:41.754
IT'S YOUR NAME,
AND I WOULD LIKE YOU

18:41.788 --> 18:44.624
TO REFER TO ME
AS NURSE TOOKERS, R.N.

18:44.657 --> 18:45.692
HERE'S OUR STOP.

18:45.725 --> 18:47.227
OKAY, BUT LOOK, LOOK,

18:47.260 --> 18:48.595
MORGAN, I DON'T WANT
TO LEAVE

18:48.628 --> 18:50.563
UNLESS I KNOW
WE'RE GOOD.

18:50.597 --> 18:53.600
OH, I'M GOOD.
OKAY.

18:53.633 --> 18:56.403
GOOD AT BEING MAD AT YOU.

18:57.604 --> 18:59.806
LOOK, I'M SORRY.
I OWE YOU AN APOLOGY, MINDY.

18:59.839 --> 19:00.807
FOR PANTSING ME
IN THE CAFETERIA?

19:00.840 --> 19:01.708
YEAH, THAT WAS NOT COOL.

19:01.741 --> 19:03.476
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
THAT WAS CLASSIC.

19:03.510 --> 19:06.446
NO, FOR GETTING YOU INVOLVED
IN THIS WHOLE THING.

19:06.479 --> 19:07.847
I MEAN, YOU DESERVE
BETTER THAN LEE,

19:07.880 --> 19:09.416
AND DANNY'S BEING AN IDIOT.

19:09.449 --> 19:11.251
YEAH, BUT I REALLY
FEEL LIKE--

19:11.284 --> 19:12.452
CAN I FINISH MY THOUGHT?

19:12.485 --> 19:13.953
I KNOW I PAUSED, BUT I JUST--
I HAVE A LITTLE MORE TO SAY.

19:13.986 --> 19:15.722
YEAH, OKAY.
THAT'S A LITTLE RUDE, BUT YEAH.

19:15.755 --> 19:17.190
ALL THIS TIME,
I'VE BEEN TELLING YOU

19:17.224 --> 19:18.425
TO THINK LIKE A PETER,
BUT I THINK

19:18.458 --> 19:19.792
I NEED TO START THINKING
LIKE A MINDY.

19:19.826 --> 19:21.261
REALLY?
IT'S MOSTLY JUST ME

19:21.294 --> 19:22.729
TRYING TO REMEMBER
WHERE I LEFT MY PHONE.

19:22.762 --> 19:24.731
YOU'RE A ROMANTIC,
AND THAT'S GOOD.

19:24.764 --> 19:26.766
IT JUST MEANS YOU'LL PROBABLY
DATE A FEW EXTRA LOSERS,

19:26.799 --> 19:28.635
RANDOS, AND PERVS.
GOD.

19:28.668 --> 19:30.203
BUT I REALLY DO THINK
YOU'LL BE REWARDED

19:30.237 --> 19:31.204
FOR IT IN THE END.

19:31.238 --> 19:32.772
THAT'S A VERY NICE THING
TO SAY.

19:32.805 --> 19:34.641
I MEAN,
NOT REWARDED ROMANTICALLY.

19:34.674 --> 19:35.975
BUT, LIKE, REWARDED LIKE,
"OH, LOOK, THERE'S TWO BAGS

19:36.008 --> 19:37.377
OF CHIPS
IN THE VENDING MACHINE."

19:37.410 --> 19:38.278
SHUT UP, PETER.

19:38.311 --> 19:39.912
(Phil)
DRINK UP, GORGEOUS.

19:39.946 --> 19:41.748
HEY.

19:41.781 --> 19:43.783
MINDY.

19:43.816 --> 19:46.586
COME TO STOMP ON MY DIGNITY
IN PERSON, HAVE YOU?

19:46.619 --> 19:48.788
WELL, GO AHEAD.

19:48.821 --> 19:50.457
I HAVE NO MORE TEARS
TO GIVE.

19:50.490 --> 19:51.758
OH, MY GOD, YOU CRIED?

19:51.791 --> 19:52.659
ASK MY MOM.

19:52.692 --> 19:54.461
I WAS ON THE PHONE
WITH HER ALL NIGHT.

19:54.494 --> 19:56.796
GOD, OKAY.
I'M SORRY.

19:56.829 --> 19:58.665
IT WAS NOT COOL
TO BLOW YOU OFF.

19:58.698 --> 20:00.500
NO ONE DESERVES
TO BE TREATED LIKE THAT.

20:00.533 --> 20:03.803
I THINK THE HARDEST PART
WAS THE NOT KNOWING WHY.

20:03.836 --> 20:05.638
OKAY, I APOLOGIZED, SO...

20:05.672 --> 20:07.340
ACCEPTED.

20:07.374 --> 20:09.942
MAY I BE SO BOLD
AS TO INVITE THEE TO DINNER?

20:09.976 --> 20:11.844
YOU KNOW WHAT, PHIL?
I'M NOT REALLY IN A PLACE

20:11.878 --> 20:13.846
WHERE I SHOULD BE
DATING ANYONE.

20:13.880 --> 20:16.816
I THINK I'M STILL HUNG UP
ON THE LAST GUY I WAS WITH,

20:16.849 --> 20:18.785
SO MAYBE
WE COULD BE FRIENDS?

20:18.818 --> 20:21.888
OH, I GET IT.
WE COULD BE FRIENDS.

20:21.921 --> 20:26.526
YES.
WELL, I WOULD LOVE THAT.

20:26.559 --> 20:28.695
AND WHEN YOU'RE READY
TO START DATING AGAIN...

20:28.728 --> 20:30.697
NO. NO.
OKAY.

20:30.730 --> 20:32.765
PHIL, I JUST DON'T SEE
A WORLD WHERE THAT'S--

20:32.799 --> 20:34.401
OKAY.
NO, NO, SERIOUSLY, THOUGH,

20:34.434 --> 20:36.035
I'M NOT--
OKAY.

20:36.068 --> 20:37.570
I--IT DOESN'T MATTER.

20:37.604 --> 20:39.672
BYE, MINDY.

20:41.774 --> 20:43.543
(Danny)
IS MINDY HERE?

20:43.576 --> 20:45.312
NO, SHE LEFT
FOR THE DAY.

20:45.345 --> 20:48.348
OKAY.

20:51.017 --> 20:53.386
[phone ringing]
(Sally)
HELLO?

20:53.420 --> 20:55.622
HEY, SALLY, IT'S DANNY.

20:55.655 --> 20:58.325
I THOUGHT I HAD SOMETHING
AT WORK,

20:58.358 --> 21:00.760
BUT, AS IT TURNS OUT,
I GOT A LUCKY BREAK,

21:00.793 --> 21:03.830
AND I'M FREE.

21:05.832 --> 21:07.634
HEY, SO DO YOU REALLY DO
THAT CINDERELLA THING

21:07.667 --> 21:09.336
WHERE YOU LEAVE EARRINGS
AT A GUY'S PLACE?

21:09.369 --> 21:10.770
WHAT? OF COURSE NOT.
THAT WOULD BE CRAZY.

21:10.803 --> 21:12.805
YEAH.

21:12.839 --> 21:14.774
(Sally)
ANYTHING INTERESTING
HAPPEN AT WORK?

21:14.807 --> 21:17.744
NOT REALLY.

21:18.878 --> 21:21.814
OOH, I LOVE THIS SHOW.

21:21.848 --> 21:25.352
IT'S GOT A REALLY FAT GUY
AND A REALLY SKINNY GUY.

21:31.691 --> 21:33.760
(man)
GO TO BED.
