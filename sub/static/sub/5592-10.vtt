If that car hit him,
where's his body?

There's too much at stake.

02:35.480 --> 02:37.767
He wouldn't have wanted me

I bet that woman who was hunting
me, Erica Kravid, took him.

Oh, two days, plenty of time.

Okay, Tommy's been
taken to Midian, Colorado,

03:25.240 --> 03:27.641
Well, because my powers are
unreliable without the sun,

03:27.800 --> 03:29.325
so if we have to fight at night,

03:29.440 --> 03:31.044
we're gonna need

Oh, they think that Bennet's

04:13.960 --> 04:14.961
That's where they're headed.

04:16.360 --> 04:18.839
Weather has closed portions of the

04:29.360 --> 04:30.771
We'll have to surprise them.

04:33.360 --> 04:36.762
Maybe we could take the girl alive.
Bring her back to Renautas.

04:36.920 --> 04:38.570

that's not the point.

Who are you?

05:21.240 --> 05:22.651

Mine, too, I guess.

I realize that.

06:45.640 --> 06:47.165
Do you?

06:48.000 --> 06:50.162
Because your digital spawn

freed Hiro Nakamura and
destroyed the Fortress,

06:53.280 --> 06:56.045
and somehow ended up here.

06:57.520 --> 07:00.569
I have had to rely
on my powers of persuasion

to keep that teenage teleporter
on a very tenuous leash.

07:07.280 --> 07:12.684

A family man.

12:09.480 --> 12:13.724
I used to be. Then my
family walked out on me.

12:13.800 --> 12:14.801
