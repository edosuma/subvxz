00:08.802 --> 00:10.512
<i>Previously on</i> Nurse <i>Jackie...</i>

00:10.595 --> 00:13.264
I need to leave,
and I need to cash in my vacation days.

00:13.348 --> 00:15.058
- Where you going?
- Disneyland.

00:15.141 --> 00:16.601
Welcome to rehab.

00:16.685 --> 00:19.104
I can't believe you're gonna
get out of this place before me.

00:19.562 --> 00:21.022
See you on the outside?

00:23.316 --> 00:26.611
Jackie Peyton,
were you sleeping with me for my drugs?

00:26.695 --> 00:27.821
Probably.

00:27.904 --> 00:29.614
Jackie was fucking me.

00:31.825 --> 00:33.535
Kevin served me with divorce papers.

00:33.868 --> 00:35.245
He is suing for custody.

00:35.328 --> 00:38.248
I just wish they'd get over themselves.

00:39.082 --> 00:40.417
What the hell do you think you're doing?

00:40.500 --> 00:43.420
You're being judgmental for someone
who just got out of rehab.

00:44.087 --> 00:45.588
I'm 16 weeks.

00:45.672 --> 00:46.840
You're pregnant?

00:47.924 --> 00:49.050
How are you?

00:50.218 --> 00:52.762
Steer clear of my bloodline.

00:55.265 --> 00:56.933
If you need a place, Zoey, I have a place.

00:57.517 --> 00:58.977
- Yes.
- Whoa, whoa!

00:59.060 --> 01:00.603
You touch me, you are homeless.

01:00.937 --> 01:02.188
I love my drugs.

01:02.272 --> 01:04.607
They're gonna bury me, and I'm fine with it.

01:05.942 --> 01:07.360
Kids, they break your heart.

01:10.488 --> 01:11.740
I just lost my fucking job.

01:11.823 --> 01:13.616
- Go fuck yourself.
- You're fired.

01:14.367 --> 01:15.452
Take a look around, Mike.

01:15.535 --> 01:17.287
I'm still in charge.

01:18.204 --> 01:20.665
- You made it.
- I made it.

01:20.749 --> 01:22.459
I fucking made it.

03:18.408 --> 03:19.534
Girls ready?

03:19.617 --> 03:23.913
Fi is. Grace has been in the bathroom
longer than should be legal for a teenager.

03:23.997 --> 03:26.124
Grace, come on, honey!

03:26.916 --> 03:28.418
How are you doing?

03:29.669 --> 03:32.380
I'm okay, thanks. How are you?

03:32.463 --> 03:34.424
I'm not asking for you.
I'm asking for the kids.

03:35.592 --> 03:37.260
Just give me a break,
will you please, Kevin?

03:37.385 --> 03:38.678
I'm clean, months and months.

03:38.761 --> 03:40.138
Great. Mother of the Year.

03:41.431 --> 03:44.225
Look, I know this isn't part of our deal,

03:44.309 --> 03:47.353
but is there any way I can get the girls
for my birthday tomorrow?

03:47.437 --> 03:49.147
I'll think about it.

03:51.149 --> 03:52.650
So someone's having a birthday?

03:53.359 --> 03:57.447
Only because I have to.
Not a word to anyone.

04:04.037 --> 04:05.788
How do you not do that in the bathroom?

04:05.872 --> 04:08.416
Grace wanted her privacy.
Gotta respect that.

04:08.499 --> 04:09.542
Can we go?

04:09.626 --> 04:10.710
What's with the face?

04:11.586 --> 04:12.587
Picture day.

04:12.670 --> 04:13.713
No, go wash it off.

04:13.796 --> 04:16.466
Damn it, Dad. I'm allowed to wear
whatever makeup I want.

04:17.175 --> 04:19.052
Me, too.

04:19.177 --> 04:21.554
All I know is, this stuff doesn't happen
when the kids are with me.

04:21.638 --> 04:23.973
Go wash it off or no screens for a week.

04:24.974 --> 04:26.392
I can't believe this.

04:26.476 --> 04:27.644
Father of the Year.

04:33.650 --> 04:36.402
Heads up, you guys!
Overturned bus three blocks away!

04:36.486 --> 04:39.322
Gambler's special from Atlantic City.

04:39.405 --> 04:40.448
Where's Jackie?

04:48.623 --> 04:49.791
You're gonna be fine, honey.

04:49.874 --> 04:51.876
Still down five grand.

04:51.960 --> 04:53.878
I knew I should have asked
for longer maternity leave.

04:53.962 --> 04:55.672
Four and a half months.
Who gets four and a half months?

04:55.755 --> 04:57.340
Incredibly brilliant doctors, love.

04:57.507 --> 04:59.133
It's so good to have you back.

04:59.217 --> 05:00.718
O'Hara, we need your help on this gurney.

05:00.843 --> 05:03.012
Wrong shoes for this.

05:09.185 --> 05:11.104
- Never thought I would miss Cruz.
- I heard that.

05:11.187 --> 05:14.983
As a doctor, he was a lousy administrator.
You are so much better.

05:15.066 --> 05:16.359
No shit.

05:16.442 --> 05:17.944
You gotta pull the trigger
on the new trauma guy.

05:18.027 --> 05:19.529
Already did. Starts next week.

05:19.612 --> 05:21.155
Yeah, tell them that.

05:21.239 --> 05:22.532
I'll call him in.

05:22.615 --> 05:25.368
What about the new resident
that actually does work here?

05:25.493 --> 05:27.787
You know, I'm the one that hired you back,
not the other way around?

05:27.870 --> 05:29.706
Yeah, was that before or after
my union sued?

05:29.789 --> 05:31.791
Don't cloud the issues with facts.

05:32.542 --> 05:34.627
Paging Doctor... Shit, what...

05:34.711 --> 05:36.254
Roman.

05:36.754 --> 05:38.131
Roman.

05:38.256 --> 05:39.465
Dr. Roman to the ER.

05:39.549 --> 05:41.175
<i>Dr. Roman to the ER.</i>

05:43.344 --> 05:44.721
Now, Doctor.

05:47.598 --> 05:49.434
- Shit.
- Tell me about it.

05:53.646 --> 05:55.815
Time to go save some lives.

05:56.232 --> 05:57.942
Coming, Nurse Peyton?

06:01.863 --> 06:03.698
Haven't slept in months,
my breasts are killing me,

06:03.781 --> 06:05.324
and I'm up to my elbows in baby shit.

06:05.408 --> 06:07.076
It's great, isn't it?

06:07.160 --> 06:08.911
Yeah.

06:08.995 --> 06:10.705
That's what sucks about the divorce.

06:10.788 --> 06:12.957
I think about Grace and Fi as babies.

06:13.041 --> 06:16.377
Kev was so great with them,
and he was so there for me.

06:16.544 --> 06:18.796
- Well, at least you had that.
- Yeah.

06:19.589 --> 06:22.592
'Sup? Wanna go for a coffee?

06:22.675 --> 06:24.635
Got a bad head wound here.

06:24.719 --> 06:26.054
Hey.

06:26.137 --> 06:28.014
- Oh, my God. All right.
- Pressure.

06:28.097 --> 06:29.474
Here. Pressure, pressure, pressure.

06:29.557 --> 06:32.685
All right, Starbucks is on hold.
Sorry.

06:32.769 --> 06:34.062
Jackie, Jackie, Jackie, Jackie.

06:34.771 --> 06:35.980
Elvis is in the building.

06:37.190 --> 06:39.275
- What?
- Elvis Page, number one draft pick.

06:39.358 --> 06:41.778
That bus crashed on top of his Bentley.

06:41.944 --> 06:43.946
Jaws of life, the whole deal.

06:44.864 --> 06:47.366
Oh, if he's injured, such a tragedy.

06:47.450 --> 06:49.368
If anybody's injured, it's a tragedy.

06:49.452 --> 06:51.037
Hello, we're talking Super Bowl.

06:56.209 --> 06:59.170
The X-rays will be ready soon, Mr. Page.
How's the arm feeling?

06:59.879 --> 07:02.548
You could amputate this arm,
I'm still taking us to the big show.

07:02.632 --> 07:03.674
See?

07:03.758 --> 07:05.384
Thor, I need you!

07:05.468 --> 07:07.136
Good thing there's enough of me
to go around.

07:07.261 --> 07:10.765
Nurse. When that bus

07:10.848 --> 07:12.850
-flipped over onto my...
- Bentley.

07:13.392 --> 07:17.396
Yeah, I may have been on my way to a party
with some party favors.

07:17.480 --> 07:18.773
Look, I don't do drugs, okay?

07:18.856 --> 07:22.777
This body is God's gift,
but I like for my friends to have a good time.

07:22.860 --> 07:24.529
I'm sure they appreciate that.

07:24.612 --> 07:26.197
Yeah, but the cops were coming

07:26.280 --> 07:31.410
and I may have put the favors into condoms
and swallowed them.

07:31.494 --> 07:32.912
What kind of favors?

07:32.995 --> 07:35.206
A smorgasbord. Mostly uppers.

07:36.582 --> 07:37.625
Okay.

07:37.708 --> 07:41.003
There anything we can do for that situation,
and kinda quick before the team finds out?

07:41.087 --> 07:43.089
- How many condoms we talking?
- Like, three.

07:43.172 --> 07:44.423
You had three condoms with you?

07:44.507 --> 07:47.260
Actually, I had six.
Told you I was on my way to a party.

07:47.343 --> 07:48.427
Yeah.

07:48.511 --> 07:50.429
And can we keep this between us?

07:51.055 --> 07:52.056
Thor!

07:55.017 --> 07:58.688
Your hero here swallowed three condoms
filled with drugs.

07:59.355 --> 08:00.773
You swallowed condoms?

08:00.857 --> 08:02.233
Yeah, strawberry-flavored.

08:02.316 --> 08:04.360
They could burst
and you would die a gruesome death

08:04.443 --> 08:05.570
and then where would our team be?

08:05.695 --> 08:07.155
I asked you to keep this quiet.

08:07.238 --> 08:10.116
You might not want to get
your stomach juices too angry.

08:10.241 --> 08:11.284
You always this nice?

08:11.367 --> 08:13.035
To be fair, it is her birthday tomorrow.

08:13.494 --> 08:16.455
And you know
how women of a certain age can get.

08:16.747 --> 08:17.748
See?

08:19.667 --> 08:21.586
Eddie, come here, I need you.

08:21.669 --> 08:23.880
Oh, God. I love it when you say that.

08:24.005 --> 08:26.632
This patient needs
the strongest laxative you got.

08:26.716 --> 08:27.967
And fastest.

08:28.050 --> 08:29.802
I don't know if you got the memo,
but I was fired.

08:29.886 --> 08:30.928
What happened?

08:31.012 --> 08:33.848
This knucklehead swallowed
three condoms filled with drugs.

08:33.931 --> 08:35.516
Yo, yo.

08:35.600 --> 08:36.642
Between us?

08:36.726 --> 08:38.352
Stomach juices.

08:39.812 --> 08:40.938
I got a 10-year-old girl with a crushed larynx.

08:41.022 --> 08:43.107
Just shut up. This machine is slow
and confusing enough.

08:43.232 --> 08:45.318
Come on,
I need morphine for my burn victim.

08:45.401 --> 08:46.944
Percocet for Mr. Texas Hold'em.

08:47.028 --> 08:48.404
- Come on.
- Shut up.

08:48.487 --> 08:50.323
Come on. Get out of the way.
Let somebody else try.

08:50.406 --> 08:51.449
Yeah, let somebody else try.

08:51.532 --> 08:53.159
Step out of the way.

08:55.786 --> 08:57.997
All right, you write everything down.

08:58.080 --> 08:59.999
- Who wants morphine?
- Yep, yep, thanks.

09:00.082 --> 09:01.125
- Percocet?
- Here.

09:01.209 --> 09:03.044
- You gettin' this?
- All of it. Who are you?

09:03.127 --> 09:04.503
- Who are you?
- New nurse.

09:04.587 --> 09:06.756
Old pharmacist.
What are they gonna do, fire me?

09:06.839 --> 09:08.216
Here, this.

09:08.299 --> 09:09.634
50 milligrams of Dulcolax.

09:09.717 --> 09:11.469
- You got a constipated racehorse?
- Something like that.

09:11.552 --> 09:13.429
Nothing leaves this room till I get back.

09:14.764 --> 09:16.933
Good news, I found something fast-acting.

09:17.016 --> 09:19.310
Bad news, it's a suppository.

09:20.561 --> 09:22.313
Bend over, Mr. Page.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.877
Zoey needs help right away.

09:51.634 --> 09:55.805
42-year-old male, head trauma.
No available doctor to intubate.

10:10.987 --> 10:13.155
Get me a new bag, please.

10:33.050 --> 10:34.844
You're gonna be okay, honey.

10:37.346 --> 10:39.974
Right, here. Get up to the CT, please.

10:46.772 --> 10:48.524
You're an angel.

10:55.031 --> 10:56.615
Far from it.

10:59.035 --> 11:00.619
Sorry I walked in on you and Kevin.

11:00.703 --> 11:02.788
- It's not that big a deal, Zoey.
- I know, it's just that

11:02.872 --> 11:05.875
I can totally relate,
because when Lenny and I broke up...

11:05.958 --> 11:07.835
Seriously, you're gonna compare your
three-month relationship

11:07.918 --> 11:09.628
with my 16-year marriage?

11:09.712 --> 11:11.422
Only the relevant parts.

11:12.548 --> 11:15.384
- Situation?
- Lacerations lower back and buttocks.

11:15.551 --> 11:17.011
Glass shards up the wazoo.

11:17.803 --> 11:19.972
Dude, silk.

11:27.146 --> 11:28.564
Dr. Roman, you might wanna...

11:28.647 --> 11:30.066
My patient. I got this.

11:31.484 --> 11:34.570
I'm sure you do.
And I'm sure he's in good hands.

11:34.695 --> 11:36.614
Still, you might want to throw
a little stitch in there.

11:38.240 --> 11:40.451
Just looking out for your breasts... Blouse.

11:54.548 --> 11:57.343
Hey. You got this, right?

11:58.677 --> 12:00.137
But of course.

12:07.436 --> 12:10.106
- What the fuck was that back there?
- What the fuck was what?

12:11.023 --> 12:15.277
Oh, God. You touch my tit,
I will rip your hand off at the spine.

12:15.361 --> 12:18.364
You work on your boob-grabbing
Tourette situation on your own time.

12:19.365 --> 12:21.492
From now on,
we're gonna finish conversations.

12:21.575 --> 12:23.494
And what is this conversation about?

12:25.955 --> 12:29.250
Dr. Roman has had every bump in the road
smoothed over

12:29.333 --> 12:30.418
-because she's...
- Hot?

12:30.501 --> 12:31.752
Expecting it.

12:32.128 --> 12:34.505
Next time she's not cutting it,
say something.

12:34.588 --> 12:36.549
- I did.
- Then back it up.

12:37.133 --> 12:38.634
This is because of your birthday, isn't it?

12:46.308 --> 12:48.144
Nice of him to remember.

12:50.771 --> 12:54.150
I know, since I started living with you,
space got tight,

12:54.275 --> 12:56.694
but it gives me real perspective on you,
and I see...

12:56.777 --> 12:58.821
And I see a patient in two
just puked himself.

12:58.904 --> 13:00.698
Stop talking and clean him up.

13:01.949 --> 13:05.744
- If I stop talking, do I still have to?
- Yes, you do.

13:10.082 --> 13:11.625
I'm sorry you had to wait so long.

13:11.709 --> 13:14.128
Today kind of put the emergency back
in "Emergency Room."

13:14.211 --> 13:15.254
Totally get it.

13:15.337 --> 13:18.090
Some of the people on the bus were
pretty messed up and I just had this cut.

13:18.174 --> 13:19.925
It's good to be lucky.

13:20.926 --> 13:22.845
And what is up with the new trauma guy?

13:22.970 --> 13:25.931
Army guy. Top dog at Landstuhl.
Three tours in Iraq, four in Afghanistan.

13:26.015 --> 13:28.100
I'm not asking about his resume.
I'm asking, where the fuck is he?

13:28.184 --> 13:29.935
I already called him...

13:30.019 --> 13:31.604
Shit, I forgot.

13:33.689 --> 13:34.857
Hey, Kev, it's me.

13:34.940 --> 13:38.277
I'm just checking to see
if I can get the girls tomorrow.

13:38.360 --> 13:41.238
It would really mean a lot to me, okay?
Call me back?

13:46.619 --> 13:49.371
I think Kevin is avoiding me.

13:49.497 --> 13:50.706
Stop worrying-

13:50.789 --> 13:53.334
He's gonna let you have the girls tomorrow,
isn't he?

13:53.417 --> 13:55.002
Are you still obsessed
with pictures of your kids,

13:55.085 --> 13:56.420
or is it just a baby thing?

13:56.545 --> 13:58.297
No, that never goes away.

13:58.380 --> 14:00.299
Grace had her school photos taken today.

14:00.382 --> 14:01.967
Maybe they're online.

14:10.684 --> 14:12.811
Wow, my daughter the hooker.

14:14.230 --> 14:15.981
She's so grown-up.

14:16.065 --> 14:18.901
And so wrong about that eye-liner.

14:19.401 --> 14:21.779
Do you wanna get out of here for a while?

14:24.823 --> 14:27.493
I swear to God, I had no fucking clue

14:27.576 --> 14:30.079
how much having him
was gonna change my life.

14:30.204 --> 14:33.082
I even vowed to stop using "Fucking"
as a modifier.

14:34.291 --> 14:36.919
Oh, fuck, that's good.

14:38.003 --> 14:41.131
- Fennel, capers, and...
- And piggy.

14:41.257 --> 14:44.176
Homegrown, happy,
lived a full and useful life.

14:44.260 --> 14:46.428
And died for this very moment.

14:49.431 --> 14:50.933
Excuse me.

14:51.016 --> 14:52.851
- What?
- Breast-feeding.

14:52.935 --> 14:55.771
I have been gushing like a BP oil rig.

14:56.313 --> 14:59.358
Pumped twice this morning...
To motherhood.

15:00.150 --> 15:01.819
To motherhood.

15:09.577 --> 15:10.869
Hi, Roberta. How's he doing?

15:11.829 --> 15:13.122
Great.

15:13.205 --> 15:15.291
Put him on, love.

15:15.374 --> 15:17.293
Sorry, Jacks. I'm a walking cliché.

15:17.459 --> 15:20.421
Hi, sweetie.

15:20.546 --> 15:23.882
Your mama misses you so much.

15:23.966 --> 15:26.594
Can you say "Mama"? Mama?

15:26.677 --> 15:29.221
Ma... No, mama?

15:29.305 --> 15:31.307
Goo to you, too, darling.

15:33.851 --> 15:36.478
Hey, where the hell are my X-rays?
I gotta get out of here.

15:36.562 --> 15:37.980
We're still waiting.

15:40.608 --> 15:41.609
Whoa, whoa, sir. Sir, sir...

15:41.692 --> 15:43.110
Sir. I'm sorry, you're not allowed back here.

15:43.193 --> 15:44.320
Yeah, but this woman needs some serious...

15:44.403 --> 15:45.904
This is hospital personnel only.

15:46.196 --> 15:48.574
Dr. Ike Prentiss reporting for duty.

15:48.699 --> 15:50.075
Are you the new army doc?

15:50.159 --> 15:51.201
You see this woman?

15:51.702 --> 15:53.245
They were admitting her for asthma.

15:53.329 --> 15:55.039
She's about five seconds away
from having an Ml.

15:57.625 --> 15:59.418
Wow, you diagnosed that on the fly.

15:59.501 --> 16:03.130
That's what I do. Now, with your permission,
the woman could use a doctor.

16:03.213 --> 16:04.340
Welcome to All Saints.

16:05.090 --> 16:07.926
All right, just gently roll her.

16:10.179 --> 16:12.598
If you're wondering, I'm ignoring you.

16:12.681 --> 16:14.141
What?

16:14.224 --> 16:17.102
- Somebody had to clean up that vomit.
- I get it.

16:20.773 --> 16:23.442
Sometimes I'm in your space too much.

16:24.234 --> 16:25.778
Like, this morning.

16:25.861 --> 16:29.990
Or when you smashed your good dishes
after that custody thing with Kevin.

16:30.115 --> 16:32.034
Or when you were on probation,

16:32.159 --> 16:33.911
and I was always coming home
and telling you

16:34.036 --> 16:37.164
about all the amazing stuff
going on here at work,

16:37.289 --> 16:38.874
probably making you jealous.

16:38.957 --> 16:41.502
- How is this helping, Zoey?
- Exactly.

16:41.627 --> 16:45.130
Sometimes I think I'm helping,

16:46.131 --> 16:48.217
and I'm actually un-helping.

16:51.220 --> 16:53.347
Which is why...

16:53.430 --> 16:58.394
I'm thinking it's time that I moved out
and got my own place.

17:00.396 --> 17:02.064
No, you don't have to do that, Zoey.

17:02.147 --> 17:06.944
I think it's best for both of us.

17:18.831 --> 17:21.250
Broken fifth metatarsal.
Six weeks in this thing.

17:21.333 --> 17:22.501
But my only sport is running.

17:22.584 --> 17:24.002
Yeah, well, life's a bitch.

17:24.086 --> 17:25.796
And no way running is a sport.

17:26.797 --> 17:28.590
Who is that?

17:28.674 --> 17:31.343
New trauma guy. Some big shot army doc.

17:31.677 --> 17:33.762
How about I just wait for a doctor?

17:33.887 --> 17:34.888
I am a doctor.

17:34.972 --> 17:36.056
You fucking kidding me?

17:36.140 --> 17:37.391
Is there a problem, sir?

17:37.474 --> 17:38.934
My doctor looks like a drug dealer.

17:39.017 --> 17:40.352
My patient looks like an asshole.

17:40.436 --> 17:42.187
- Okay if we just move on?
- Yeah.

17:42.604 --> 17:46.024
Those tattoos? People you've killed?

17:46.108 --> 17:48.652
Actually, they're saves.

17:48.819 --> 17:51.113
- Still want another doctor?
- I'm good.

17:51.196 --> 17:52.573
Okay, sir. Here's the drill.

17:52.656 --> 17:55.117
First stop is ortho where they will...

17:58.036 --> 17:59.163
These are just of his foot.

17:59.246 --> 18:00.539
That was his complaint, Doctor.

18:00.622 --> 18:01.874
He was hit by a car, Doctor.

18:08.172 --> 18:09.465
Hard as a rock. Got to be a liver lac.

18:09.548 --> 18:11.884
- Let's tap him.
- Tap him? Let's get him to CT.

18:12.009 --> 18:14.553
No time. We have to tap and confirm
the bleeding, then get him to the OR.

18:14.678 --> 18:16.722
We haven't tapped in years.
We don't even have that stuff.

18:16.805 --> 18:19.016
Then we improvise, scalpel and a Foley.

18:23.562 --> 18:26.023
Whoa, whoa, wait, wait, wait.
This isn't Kandahar.

18:30.611 --> 18:31.779
IV saline.

18:37.534 --> 18:38.619
What is he doing?

18:38.702 --> 18:40.120
Seeing if there's internal bleeding.

18:49.922 --> 18:52.132
All right, get him to the OR. Now, now.

18:59.389 --> 19:02.559
The irony of saving a racist prick's life.

19:02.684 --> 19:05.771
Hardly worth a tattoo,
but he's no different than anyone else.

19:05.854 --> 19:07.105
Even you thought I was a bum.

19:07.523 --> 19:08.607
Well, you were filthy.

19:08.690 --> 19:11.485
Okay, so if your Dr. Cooper
or that fuzzy nurse

19:11.568 --> 19:14.112
came into your ER
after dry walling their basement,

19:14.196 --> 19:15.531
you would have thought they were bums.

19:16.114 --> 19:17.157
Right.

19:17.449 --> 19:21.703
Listen, don't beat yourself up.
Just hop down off that soapbox, Nurse...

19:22.329 --> 19:24.164
Peyton.

19:25.499 --> 19:27.376
It's Jackie.

19:28.377 --> 19:29.962
That hurts.

19:30.045 --> 19:31.547
Okay, need a little help here.

19:33.632 --> 19:34.800
Just need a nurse.

19:34.883 --> 19:37.135
Zoey, stay.

19:37.219 --> 19:39.805
Go. I've done this a dozen times.

19:42.724 --> 19:45.227
And I've done it a thousand times.
Step away, Doctor.

19:45.853 --> 19:47.813
Take a deep breath,
put your chin to your chest,

19:47.896 --> 19:49.481
sip on that water, okay?

19:56.488 --> 20:00.409
Excuse me, Nurse Peyton.
My husband's still waiting.

20:00.742 --> 20:01.952
Really?

20:03.871 --> 20:06.748
You scanned a bladder tumor
before my head trauma?

20:06.832 --> 20:09.418
We're down to one working machine
with seven patients ahead of him.

20:09.501 --> 20:10.544
Then get another machine.

20:10.627 --> 20:13.338
They're $425,000 apiece.
How do you suggest I do that?

20:13.422 --> 20:16.508
We have a critically injured patient
who has been waiting for two hours.

20:16.592 --> 20:19.052
That woman's tumor
is gonna be the same size tomorrow.

20:19.428 --> 20:20.470
I have to call.

20:20.554 --> 20:21.847
No, I get it. You're an administrator.

20:21.930 --> 20:24.683
You have to deal
with all the red-tape bullshit. I understand.

20:24.766 --> 20:26.810
Let's not forget why we are really here.

20:31.481 --> 20:33.859
10-pack of Percocet.

20:33.942 --> 20:37.654
All right, let's cross-reference here.
What've we got?

20:39.114 --> 20:40.449
What are you doing?

20:40.532 --> 20:42.659
I was helping. it was an emergency.

20:43.535 --> 20:45.120
Good-bye.

20:46.830 --> 20:50.167
This is a lawsuit waiting to bite my butt.
You're not even an employee.

20:50.292 --> 20:52.044
And I'm sorry, Gloria. I...

20:52.127 --> 20:53.962
Which is why I have no choice...

20:56.465 --> 20:57.633
...but to hire you back.

21:08.393 --> 21:09.978
Okay, tell you what.

21:11.021 --> 21:13.106
Give me two minutes.
I'm gonna go in there and say hey.

21:13.190 --> 21:14.983
I'll be right back.

21:16.318 --> 21:17.653
The X-rays came back negative.

21:18.153 --> 21:19.237
Then I'm outta here.

21:19.321 --> 21:21.573
Well, not so fast. I had to report the drugs.

21:21.657 --> 21:23.408
Those officers are gonna need
to talk to you.

21:23.492 --> 21:25.327
Look, I told you, they weren't even for me.

21:25.410 --> 21:27.829
That's the problem.
Possession with intent to distribute.

21:27.913 --> 21:28.956
You don't have to do this.

21:29.039 --> 21:30.457
There wasn't any other option.

21:32.751 --> 21:36.672
I could tell the officers I made a mistake if...

21:37.422 --> 21:39.716
Let me guess. You live in Queens,

21:39.841 --> 21:42.552
little house, what, $100,000 mortgage?

21:43.011 --> 21:45.055
Fine, I'll take care of it for you.

21:45.472 --> 21:48.225
You know what? Fuck you.
You don't know anything about me.

21:48.433 --> 21:50.185
Okay, where do you live?

21:50.936 --> 21:53.855
Queens, little house, $110,000 mortgage.

21:53.981 --> 21:55.941
But I'm not interested
in taking a nickel from you.

21:56.441 --> 21:59.111
The hospital needs a new CT machine.

21:59.194 --> 22:00.529
Okay, what's that run?

22:01.363 --> 22:02.864
$425,000.

22:02.948 --> 22:05.325
$425,000.. Who do you think I am?

22:05.409 --> 22:07.744
We've already established who you are.
Now we're just haggling.

22:09.287 --> 22:11.623
Thor tells me you just signed
a big fat contract.

22:11.707 --> 22:13.959
Wonder what they're gonna pay you
in prison.

22:16.211 --> 22:19.506
Good-bye, Nike, good-bye, Gatorade,
good-bye, Dancing <i>with</i> the Stars.

22:19.589 --> 22:21.842
Okay, I'll buy your fucking machine.

22:23.677 --> 22:24.970
What's it do, anyway?

22:25.679 --> 22:27.723
It helps us win the Super Bowl.

22:29.266 --> 22:32.477
Tommy, Angelo, Mr. Page'll be happy
to sign those autographs now.

22:35.981 --> 22:39.317
You have to make Zoey promise
no cake tomorrow

22:39.401 --> 22:42.154
'cause she absolutely does not listen to me.

22:42.237 --> 22:45.115
Where are you going?
You've been here one day.

22:51.997 --> 22:54.416
Do not even say it.

22:57.461 --> 22:59.755
I want to be with my baby all the time.

23:00.213 --> 23:03.175
That's amazing, 'cause, you know, you're
the first mother that ever felt that way.

23:06.011 --> 23:08.930
When you were on probation,
spending all that time with your kids...

23:09.014 --> 23:10.057
It was great.

23:10.140 --> 23:12.809
And then I came back to work,
'cause that's what we do.

23:14.019 --> 23:16.563
There are all kinds of people here
who depend on you.

23:16.646 --> 23:19.941
Actually, one person depends on me.

23:20.859 --> 23:22.486
And I have to be there for him.

23:23.153 --> 23:27.616
I don't want my child
growing up hating me for being absent.

23:27.741 --> 23:29.451
I want him hating me for being me.

23:29.534 --> 23:32.829
I think you... I think you have to slow down.

23:32.913 --> 23:35.957
You have to think this through.
This is a huge step.

23:36.124 --> 23:38.835
Maybe... Maybe you should talk
to a therapist.

23:38.919 --> 23:40.212
A therapist? I'm British.

23:41.088 --> 23:42.589
Jacks, I have thought this through.

23:42.672 --> 23:47.761
I don't want to miss his first words,
his first steps, his first anything.

23:47.844 --> 23:49.846
You know me.
I'm rich, narcissistic, and selfish.

23:49.930 --> 23:51.807
I don't want to miss that stuff,
and I don't have to.

23:51.932 --> 23:53.183
How nice for you.

23:53.266 --> 23:55.727
It'd be great if we could all just quit our jobs
and fly away.

23:55.811 --> 23:57.437
I know you're pissed off.

23:59.648 --> 24:01.441
So when are you leaving?

24:04.528 --> 24:06.071
When are you leaving?

24:06.530 --> 24:08.198
Today's my last day.

24:10.992 --> 24:14.371
Really? The day before my birthday?

24:18.375 --> 24:20.585
I don't think you understand.

24:20.669 --> 24:24.673
You are the only thing
standing between me and...

24:26.675 --> 24:29.302
Oh, hello, baby.

24:29.678 --> 24:31.596
Hello, baby.

24:32.139 --> 24:33.807
Come to me.

24:33.890 --> 24:37.644
My gosh.
Who's the most beautiful baby?

24:37.978 --> 24:40.438
Who's the most beautiful baby ever?

24:40.564 --> 24:42.399
Look at you.

24:42.482 --> 24:44.609
Oh, my gosh.

24:46.027 --> 24:47.779
Oh, my gosh.

24:54.494 --> 24:56.371
Look, I'm good now, all right?

24:56.454 --> 25:01.501
And as a gesture of gratitude to All Saints
for taking such amazing care of me,

25:01.585 --> 25:04.087
I'm donating a new CT machine
to the hospital.

25:04.171 --> 25:07.215
All right, that's just my way
of giving back to my community

25:07.382 --> 25:11.344
and the great city of New York City.

25:12.179 --> 25:13.513
<i>Hey, Jackie, it's Kevin.</i>

25:13.597 --> 25:16.224
<i>I know it's your birthday tomorrow,
but we had a plan.</i>

25:16.308 --> 25:19.060
<i>And I think you should start sticking
to the agreements we make.</i>

25:19.144 --> 25:21.730
<i>So I'm gonna keep the girls.
I already told them.</i>

25:22.522 --> 25:24.149
<i>Have a good one.</i>

27:14.551 --> 27:16.803
Happy fucking birthday.
