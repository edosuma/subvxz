NETFLIX PRESENTS

02:29.800 --> 02:30.920
Let me go!

02:32.760 --> 02:33.880
Shush, stay still.

02:42.640 --> 02:43.560
Where are my clothes?

02:45.440 --> 02:46.440
I don't know!

02:47.240 --> 02:48.600
Who are you?

02:49.360 --> 02:50.720
Who the hell are <i>you</i>?

02:54.120 --> 02:56.440
Don't move. You're fucking hurting me!

02:57.640 --> 02:58.600
Don't move.

03:00.760 --> 03:01.800
Let me go.

03:04.000 --> 03:05.120
We're stuck together.

03:05.720 --> 03:06.560
What?

03:12.080 --> 03:12.920
Don't move!

03:13.000 --> 03:15.400
-Don't touch me!
-Stop screaming!

03:18.240 --> 03:19.200
Please…

03:19.880 --> 03:21.280
It hurts me. My head hurts.

03:23.320 --> 03:24.280
Who are you?

03:24.800 --> 03:26.480
Let's try to sit up.

03:27.560 --> 03:29.840
I want to know
why we can't detach ourselves.

03:46.320 --> 03:47.520
What's that?

03:49.520 --> 03:50.640
Surgical tape?

03:51.200 --> 03:52.240
What?

03:57.080 --> 03:58.120
I think we are…

03:59.520 --> 04:00.600
stuck together.

04:01.840 --> 04:02.800
Stuck together?

04:03.360 --> 04:05.360
-How?
-I don't know.

04:05.440 --> 04:06.840
-With glue?
-I don't know.

04:13.080 --> 04:15.240
-Help!
-We have to keep calm.

04:15.320 --> 04:16.720
-Help!
-Calm down.

04:16.800 --> 04:18.400
-Help!
-Calm down.

04:18.480 --> 04:19.800
Stay still.

04:20.400 --> 04:21.560
Just stay still

04:21.640 --> 04:23.080
for one fucking second!

04:23.920 --> 04:25.040
Stay still!

04:33.400 --> 04:34.760
Why did you do this to me?

04:35.960 --> 04:37.280
I didn't do anything.

04:37.360 --> 04:38.480
Who are you?

04:38.560 --> 04:40.000
Who the hell are <i>you</i>?

04:46.160 --> 04:48.680
If we don't calm down,
it will get much worse.

04:49.560 --> 04:50.480
Okay?

04:53.360 --> 04:54.760
We have to come unstuck.

04:54.840 --> 04:56.120
No, I don't think we can.

04:57.480 --> 04:58.320
Why not?

05:02.360 --> 05:03.200
Stop it!

05:05.400 --> 05:06.720
Don't!

05:06.800 --> 05:07.640
Don't.

05:30.920 --> 05:32.480
How did I get here?

05:32.560 --> 05:34.000
Where are we?

05:34.080 --> 05:35.760
Let's try it again. Listen to me.

05:35.840 --> 05:37.120
We're going to try again.

05:47.240 --> 05:48.280
My head…

05:51.680 --> 05:52.800
I'm dying of thirst.

05:53.400 --> 05:54.320
Me too.

06:05.120 --> 06:06.880
What's the last thing you remember?

06:09.280 --> 06:10.600
I left my house…

06:14.080 --> 06:15.680
to meet with my husband.

06:20.440 --> 06:21.320
What about you?

06:25.720 --> 06:27.320
I was on a date.

06:35.240 --> 06:36.720
We must have been drugged.

06:36.800 --> 06:37.640
How?

06:38.920 --> 06:39.880
I don't know.

06:41.360 --> 06:42.440
Rohypnol…

06:43.880 --> 06:45.480
scopolamine, scoop.

06:45.560 --> 06:46.600
Scoop?

06:47.760 --> 06:48.880
Chemical submission.

06:50.000 --> 06:52.360
It overrides your will.
Turns you into a zombie.

06:52.440 --> 06:54.000
And you don't remember a thing.

06:55.960 --> 06:57.280
How do you know all this?

06:58.840 --> 07:00.160
What world do you live in?

07:03.120 --> 07:04.360
These drugs are used by…

07:06.200 --> 07:07.040
By whom?

07:11.320 --> 07:12.360
Rapists.

07:13.960 --> 07:14.800
Calm down.

07:16.160 --> 07:17.320
So, you also raped me?

07:17.400 --> 07:19.920
I didn't do anything to you!
I didn't do anything!

07:20.440 --> 07:22.440
-I didn't--
-Let go of me!

07:25.840 --> 07:27.240
That's a needle mark.

07:28.080 --> 07:29.040
You sedated me.

07:35.240 --> 07:36.880
-Get off.
-Let go of me!

07:47.080 --> 07:48.400
We're stitched together.

07:52.000 --> 07:53.400
We're stitched together.

07:57.920 --> 08:00.680
-Why didn't you say anything?
-To avoid this.

08:02.080 --> 08:02.960
Calm down.

08:03.640 --> 08:04.680
Calm down.

08:04.760 --> 08:07.240
I'm sure it's just skin to skin.
That's it.

08:07.320 --> 08:08.280
"That's it"?

08:08.360 --> 08:11.320
Yes. We can cut the seam,
and it'll barely leave a scar.

08:13.200 --> 08:14.720
Why did they do this to us?

08:18.960 --> 08:20.280
Will they demand a ransom?

08:21.680 --> 08:23.120
They won't get much from me.

08:26.160 --> 08:27.280
I'm cold.

08:30.400 --> 08:31.400
Don't touch me.

08:32.440 --> 08:34.520
I am only trying to warm you up.

08:48.520 --> 08:50.240
Those two paintings are identical.

08:51.400 --> 08:52.960
It's like they're watching us.

08:53.040 --> 08:54.560
Where the fuck are we?

08:56.000 --> 08:58.320
-This could be a hotel room.
-I don't think so.

09:08.040 --> 09:09.120
What do we know?

09:17.960 --> 09:19.320
Someone drugged us.

09:21.600 --> 09:22.800
At one point.

09:25.280 --> 09:26.920
And kept us sedated…

09:27.800 --> 09:29.480
while they were doing this to us.

09:32.040 --> 09:33.960
Then they brought us here.

09:34.040 --> 09:36.000
Or else they stitched us together here.

09:39.960 --> 09:40.880
Calm down.

09:40.960 --> 09:42.000
Breathe.

09:42.680 --> 09:43.520
Breathe.

09:44.040 --> 09:44.960
Leave me alone.

09:45.040 --> 09:47.200
I'm just trying to calm you down.
Calm down!

09:47.280 --> 09:48.600
Let me make this clear.

09:49.280 --> 09:52.600
Until proven otherwise,
you're my prime suspect.

09:52.680 --> 09:55.440
-That's a bit unfair.
-Unfair is what's happening to me.

09:55.520 --> 09:57.000
What's happening to <i>us</i>.

09:58.520 --> 10:02.080
How do I know that you aren't the psycho
that planned all this?

10:02.160 --> 10:05.120
I don't need to drug women
to get into bed with them.

10:19.040 --> 10:21.240
We can't tell whether it's day or night.

10:22.680 --> 10:24.440
They have taken everything from us.

10:26.000 --> 10:26.840
Clothes.

10:27.360 --> 10:29.200
Watches. Cell phones.

10:29.720 --> 10:31.960
At least they left you your earrings.

10:33.800 --> 10:34.640
What?

10:35.280 --> 10:36.120
What's wrong?

10:37.320 --> 10:38.920
These aren't mine!

10:40.680 --> 10:42.480
-Whose are they?
-How would I know?

10:43.040 --> 10:43.880
Disgusting!

10:43.960 --> 10:45.000
Jesus!

10:45.560 --> 10:47.240
We're well and truly fucked.

10:50.840 --> 10:52.880
-Fuck.
-That's disgusting! Please…

10:56.520 --> 10:58.000
There's a phone on the table.

10:58.600 --> 10:59.680
We can call for help.

11:00.760 --> 11:01.640
It won't work.

11:02.240 --> 11:04.720
-Why not?
-Kidnappers don't leave you phones.

11:06.440 --> 11:07.280
Listen,

11:08.320 --> 11:10.560
could a boyfriend have done this?

11:11.160 --> 11:12.600
A very angry one?

11:12.680 --> 11:14.120
I'm married.

11:14.880 --> 11:16.000
That's what I mean.

11:16.600 --> 11:17.680
Leave me alone.

11:17.760 --> 11:19.320
If you want, I'll just go.

11:21.480 --> 11:22.560
I am not in the mood.

11:22.640 --> 11:24.640
I'm laughing to keep myself from crying.

11:25.280 --> 11:26.840
There has to be an explanation.

11:27.360 --> 11:28.640
Let's think.

11:28.720 --> 11:30.560
Why would they do this to us?

11:31.800 --> 11:33.240
Are we connected in any way?

11:33.320 --> 11:35.800
-Where do you live?
-Close to the industrial zone.

11:37.920 --> 11:40.280
Something tells me
that's not your habitat.

11:40.360 --> 11:42.480
-I live in Augusta Park.
-Yeah, thought so.

11:43.080 --> 11:44.560
-Any siblings?
-No.

11:44.640 --> 11:45.880
I'm an only child. You?

11:46.560 --> 11:47.400
I'm an orphan.

11:47.480 --> 11:48.640
I'm sorry.

11:49.360 --> 11:50.280
Where do you work?

11:52.760 --> 11:53.800
At the port.

11:56.560 --> 11:58.040
I work at a clothes store.

11:58.640 --> 11:59.480
Well… worked.

12:01.600 --> 12:02.640
How old are you?

12:02.720 --> 12:03.560
Thirty eight.

12:04.280 --> 12:05.120
And you?

12:06.360 --> 12:07.200
Thirty three.

12:08.040 --> 12:10.360
I went to a public school,
I bet you went to a private one.

12:12.720 --> 12:14.720
Obviously, we have nothing in common.

12:27.320 --> 12:28.960
A remote control?

12:42.120 --> 12:43.720
There are cameras.

12:44.720 --> 12:46.040
We're being filmed.

12:49.440 --> 12:50.280
Where?

12:51.080 --> 12:51.920
I don't know.

12:55.560 --> 12:57.120
We have to separate.

12:57.760 --> 12:59.560
But I don't know how.

13:03.000 --> 13:04.600
I heard a door slam shut.

13:06.840 --> 13:08.320
Where the fuck are we?

13:10.640 --> 13:11.480
Dogs.

13:12.920 --> 13:14.040
Near a dog pound?

13:16.560 --> 13:17.520
The phone.

13:17.600 --> 13:19.560
We have to get up and call for help.

13:19.640 --> 13:21.240
It's not going to work.

13:21.320 --> 13:22.440
Let's try at least.

13:24.200 --> 13:25.920
Okay. We'll get up.

13:27.240 --> 13:28.520
This is going to hurt.

13:29.840 --> 13:31.280
What are you doing?

13:32.040 --> 13:33.120
Not like that.

13:34.040 --> 13:34.880
Let me do it.

13:35.960 --> 13:39.120
First of all, we should try to get
to the edge of the bed.

13:39.880 --> 13:41.000
Do as I say.

13:41.680 --> 13:44.040
I'm going to roll over you, okay?

14:01.840 --> 14:03.920
Now, let's try to sit up.

14:04.000 --> 14:04.840
Come on.

14:19.280 --> 14:20.840
And now, how do we stand up?

14:22.320 --> 14:24.360
My name is David, by the way.

14:26.440 --> 14:27.280
Sara.

14:30.800 --> 14:33.200
-When I say "now," we stand up.
-Okay.

14:34.720 --> 14:37.440
One, two, now!

14:39.920 --> 14:40.800
Hold tight!

14:44.880 --> 14:46.240
I said hold tight, dammit!

14:46.320 --> 14:48.680
I haven't got the strength, you moron!

14:48.760 --> 14:50.920
-Don't insult me!
-Or what? You'll hit me?

14:56.800 --> 14:58.880
I'm sorry. It hurts.

15:01.400 --> 15:02.760
We can't even walk.

15:03.600 --> 15:06.800
Hey, come on. Let's try again.

15:06.880 --> 15:07.720
Okay?

15:08.640 --> 15:10.640
I'm going to hold you by the waist.

15:10.720 --> 15:11.560
Okay.

15:15.240 --> 15:16.280
Let's go.

15:16.360 --> 15:17.400
One…

15:17.480 --> 15:19.720
two, and three!

15:36.440 --> 15:38.000
Don't look at me like that.

15:41.600 --> 15:43.480
On three, step towards the table.

15:43.560 --> 15:44.400
Come on.

15:44.480 --> 15:47.360
One, two, step.

15:57.400 --> 15:58.240
No dial tone.

16:00.880 --> 16:02.120
Don't drink it!

16:03.120 --> 16:04.200
I'm dying of thirst!

16:05.040 --> 16:06.160
You knew, didn't you?

16:07.240 --> 16:08.120
Here.

16:13.400 --> 16:15.880
Come on.
I want to figure out where we are.

16:21.120 --> 16:21.960
Damn.

16:22.040 --> 16:22.880
Let me go.

16:24.360 --> 16:27.800
Help! Help! Is anyone there?

16:27.880 --> 16:29.320
We need help!

16:29.400 --> 16:30.440
Calm down.

16:30.520 --> 16:32.480
-Help! Let go of me!
-Calm down.

16:32.560 --> 16:33.400
Calm down.

16:33.920 --> 16:35.520
I'm stitched to a stranger,

16:35.600 --> 16:38.320
we're god knows where,
and I've probably been raped.

16:38.400 --> 16:40.720
-Not by me, I swear.
-How do you know?

16:40.800 --> 16:43.960
-We don't remember anything.
-I'm not a fucking rapist!

16:46.880 --> 16:48.000
I'm sorry.

16:48.520 --> 16:49.720
I can't take it anymore.

16:49.800 --> 16:53.240
Listen, if we want to get out of here,
we have to keep calm. Okay?

16:54.280 --> 16:55.120
Calm down.

16:55.640 --> 16:57.000
And now, on top of that…

17:02.320 --> 17:03.280
What?

17:03.360 --> 17:05.080
Me too, I'm also…

17:05.800 --> 17:06.880
I also need to…

17:10.880 --> 17:13.360
-What do we do?
-That must be the bathroom.

17:14.080 --> 17:15.040
Come on.

17:15.880 --> 17:17.680
Wait, what if someone's there?

17:24.480 --> 17:25.880
We'll find out soon enough.

18:08.240 --> 18:09.120
Fuck.

18:10.040 --> 18:12.160
I've never felt so humiliated in my life.

18:13.600 --> 18:15.560
I wish I could say the same.

18:17.680 --> 18:19.120
I feel so ashamed.

18:19.200 --> 18:20.400
Close your eyes.

18:22.880 --> 18:24.600
We need to squat at the same time.

18:58.640 --> 18:59.880
I'm done.

19:03.160 --> 19:04.440
We can stand up now.

19:05.160 --> 19:07.520
One, two, up.

19:16.080 --> 19:17.760
Now, I don't know how to…

19:19.680 --> 19:20.640
By sitting down.

19:21.920 --> 19:22.760
Right.

19:24.040 --> 19:25.440
I'll sit down. Okay.

19:27.560 --> 19:29.720
Hang on. Let me close my legs.

19:29.800 --> 19:30.840
-One.
-Two.

19:30.920 --> 19:32.080
Two. Down.

19:36.800 --> 19:38.560
Wait. One second.

20:04.920 --> 20:05.800
Hey.

20:07.440 --> 20:09.280
We'll get through this. You hear me?

20:09.360 --> 20:10.640
I am not so sure of that.

20:12.360 --> 20:14.520
Think of the people
who are waiting for you.

20:15.840 --> 20:16.840
No one is waiting.

20:17.520 --> 20:18.440
Your husband?

20:20.880 --> 20:22.480
Oh yeah, right, my husband.

20:28.520 --> 20:30.000
All done.

20:31.360 --> 20:32.240
Let's go.

20:32.320 --> 20:33.200
Up.

20:41.160 --> 20:43.400
And you? Is someone waiting for you?

20:44.360 --> 20:45.200
Goldie.

20:46.240 --> 20:47.080
My dog.

20:50.280 --> 20:51.520
What's so funny?

20:53.400 --> 20:55.600
He's been alone all day,
he must be really scared.

20:55.680 --> 20:56.520
Of course.

20:57.040 --> 20:58.240
He keeps me company.

20:59.080 --> 21:01.000
Dogs are nicer than most people.

21:01.080 --> 21:02.360
They care about you.

21:02.440 --> 21:03.600
They don't judge.

21:03.680 --> 21:04.720
They aren't selfish.

21:09.240 --> 21:10.120
Put this on.

21:13.360 --> 21:14.280
Please.

21:24.960 --> 21:26.640
I'm afraid of the dark.

21:26.720 --> 21:27.600
Don't worry,

21:28.480 --> 21:29.440
so am I.

21:34.200 --> 21:36.320
I think there's someone here.

21:36.400 --> 21:37.240
What?

21:38.000 --> 21:39.600
Where? How?

21:39.680 --> 21:40.520
I don't know…

21:45.120 --> 21:46.240
Those pills.

21:47.280 --> 21:49.760
-They weren't there.
-They were. We just hadn't noticed.

21:49.840 --> 21:50.880
No. They weren't.

21:51.840 --> 21:53.400
-Was someone in the room?
-Yes.

21:55.720 --> 21:57.400
Careful! What are you doing?

21:57.480 --> 21:58.640
Someone came in here.

22:00.320 --> 22:01.400
-Jesus.
-What?

22:01.480 --> 22:03.480
-Those bastards.
-What is it?

22:03.560 --> 22:04.400
Does it hurt?

22:09.360 --> 22:10.200
No.

22:11.480 --> 22:12.320
No.

22:13.800 --> 22:15.120
My head hurts.

22:22.560 --> 22:23.560
Painkillers.

22:24.360 --> 22:25.200
Here.

22:25.720 --> 22:26.680
Perfect.

22:31.880 --> 22:32.720
What about you?

22:35.160 --> 22:38.080
It's odd that you don't want it.
You have a headache too.

22:38.160 --> 22:39.480
I also have an ulcer.

22:40.480 --> 22:41.440
How convenient.

22:41.520 --> 22:43.640
Do you still believe I'm behind this shit?

22:46.200 --> 22:47.880
Whatever. It can't get any worse.

22:56.600 --> 22:58.200
I need to lie down.

22:58.880 --> 23:00.040
My head is spinning.

23:01.320 --> 23:03.160
-Let's go back to the bed.
-Okay.

23:03.680 --> 23:05.160
Slowly, please.

23:13.280 --> 23:14.120
The phone…

23:14.200 --> 23:15.480
Careful! Easy.

23:18.760 --> 23:19.640
Nothing.

23:21.680 --> 23:23.440
Crouch down.

23:32.080 --> 23:34.080
The earrings… Give them to me.

23:51.400 --> 23:52.600
What do you do, again?

23:56.560 --> 23:57.760
I work with my hands.

24:05.880 --> 24:06.800
The Bible.

24:09.720 --> 24:11.760
There's a passage that's marked here.

24:12.960 --> 24:14.840
"The wolf will live with the lamb,

24:14.920 --> 24:17.480
the leopard will lie down with the goat,

24:17.560 --> 24:20.560
the calf and the lion
and the yearling together,

24:21.560 --> 24:23.520
and a little child will lead them."

24:25.720 --> 24:26.760
What does it mean?

24:28.760 --> 24:29.600
No idea.

24:34.640 --> 24:35.560
Another Bible.

24:36.640 --> 24:39.600
Great. We need as much help as possible
to get out of here.

24:40.200 --> 24:43.160
-They're identical.
-Look, something fell out of the book.

24:48.200 --> 24:49.040
"Rita."

24:50.160 --> 24:51.200
Who is Rita?

24:52.200 --> 24:53.080
I don't know.

24:54.400 --> 24:58.320
I have a photo taken at the same place.
I studied French there for a year.

24:59.600 --> 25:02.320
I've only been there once
with a girlfriend, years ago.

25:02.840 --> 25:05.320
I'll never forget that flight.
It was a nightmare.

25:05.400 --> 25:07.120
It was… Like a roller coaster.

25:07.720 --> 25:09.440
Does she look familiar to you?

25:11.840 --> 25:12.800
No.

25:14.320 --> 25:16.840
Come with me.
Let's walk toward the paintings.

25:16.920 --> 25:17.800
Let's stand up.

25:17.880 --> 25:19.800
One, two, three.

25:19.880 --> 25:20.720
Up.

25:22.120 --> 25:23.360
-Let's walk.
-Careful.

25:31.600 --> 25:32.760
What is that?

25:46.840 --> 25:48.240
There must be more of these.

25:49.080 --> 25:50.440
How did you know?

25:51.080 --> 25:53.600
-They must be watching us.
-What exactly do you do?

26:06.000 --> 26:07.120
It's on now.

26:07.640 --> 26:08.720
I'll call the police.

26:08.800 --> 26:09.960
-The police?
-Yes.

26:11.720 --> 26:13.600
You don't want me to call the police?

26:19.080 --> 26:20.480
They're jammed.

27:04.440 --> 27:05.800
Mozart's <i>Requiem</i>.

27:07.880 --> 27:09.480
His favorite piece of music.

27:10.920 --> 27:12.240
Whose? What's happening?

27:14.040 --> 27:15.080
Forgive me.

27:17.800 --> 27:18.680
It was him.

27:20.440 --> 27:21.280
Mario.

27:23.440 --> 27:24.520
My husband.

27:27.560 --> 27:29.040
What are you talking about?

27:29.920 --> 27:31.080
He's a prominent figure

27:31.760 --> 27:33.720
in exact sciences and philosophy.

27:36.920 --> 27:39.560
He has dedicated his life
to researching one number.

27:41.400 --> 27:43.400
Number two is his religion.

27:44.080 --> 27:44.920
Two?

27:45.680 --> 27:47.160
What makes it so fascinating?

27:47.240 --> 27:49.480
It's the lowest prime number.

27:49.560 --> 27:51.720
And it's the only one that's even.

27:51.800 --> 27:53.680
It's the basis for the binary system.

27:54.200 --> 27:58.320
The only number that gives
the same result if it's added to itself,

27:58.400 --> 28:02.040
multiplied by itself,
or raised to the power of itself.

28:02.120 --> 28:03.920
It's the second Motzkin number.

28:04.440 --> 28:07.320
Plato, Pythagoras…
They already knew how important it was.

28:07.400 --> 28:08.400
It's the duality.

28:09.080 --> 28:11.000
The basis of the bilateral symmetry.

28:12.080 --> 28:13.880
The two sides of the brain.

28:13.960 --> 28:16.600
Yin and yang. Female and male.

28:16.680 --> 28:19.880
-Body and soul.
-You didn't strike me as an intellectual.

28:20.640 --> 28:21.480
I am not.

28:22.400 --> 28:24.520
But I've lived with Mario for many years.

28:25.120 --> 28:27.840
Why would someone like him
do something like this?

28:27.920 --> 28:30.120
He's convinced I'm having an affair.

28:31.160 --> 28:32.560
He can be very cruel.

28:32.640 --> 28:35.240
But it's insane to do this to me.

28:35.320 --> 28:37.240
You say he's really jealous…

28:37.320 --> 28:39.680
and yet he puts you in bed,
sewn to another man?

28:40.840 --> 28:42.320
Two identical Bibles.

28:43.080 --> 28:44.800
Two identical paintings.

28:45.840 --> 28:48.600
His favorite music plays
when you dial two on the phone.

28:49.200 --> 28:50.600
Two weeks ago,

28:51.320 --> 28:52.880
he left me because…

28:53.440 --> 28:56.240
he said he was convinced I had a lover.

28:58.440 --> 29:00.760
Have you… cheated on him?

29:03.720 --> 29:07.000
-If this is your jealous husband…
-No, I haven't cheated on him.

29:07.080 --> 29:08.280
Yeah, sure.

29:10.800 --> 29:14.240
I got a message from him
saying he wanted to talk to me.

29:16.040 --> 29:18.240
But I can't remember
where he wanted to meet.

29:18.320 --> 29:21.480
Maybe that's why he brought you here!
He wants you to confess!

29:21.560 --> 29:22.520
What about you?

29:23.040 --> 29:25.000
If that's true, why did he bring you?

29:25.080 --> 29:26.840
-Exactly!
-What are you hiding?

29:26.920 --> 29:29.240
Don't try to make this about me!

29:29.320 --> 29:31.560
Your face, your cared-for skin,

29:31.640 --> 29:34.520
your perfect tan in the middle of winter,

29:34.600 --> 29:38.040
your cloying perfume,
this cheap Don Juan vibe about you…

29:38.120 --> 29:39.480
Are you a gigolo?

29:43.160 --> 29:44.320
Escort.

29:45.120 --> 29:47.680
-A male whore?
-This has nothing to do with my work.

29:47.760 --> 29:49.760
Yes, it does. You said so before.

29:49.840 --> 29:51.680
Maybe your client's husband

29:51.760 --> 29:55.000
wants to fuck you up for banging his wife.

29:55.080 --> 29:57.800
No way, my dates are safe.
Everything is under control.

29:57.880 --> 29:59.000
Dates?

29:59.080 --> 30:00.400
-Yes.
-What the fuck…

30:00.480 --> 30:04.120
What you're saying makes no sense.
If this is my fault, why are you here?

30:10.360 --> 30:13.440
Is he capable of killing you?

30:19.840 --> 30:21.880
I promise we will get out of here.

30:25.360 --> 30:26.240
Come.

30:28.840 --> 30:29.720
Let's go.

30:34.320 --> 30:35.560
What are you doing?

30:40.000 --> 30:41.480
There's nothing we can do.

30:41.560 --> 30:43.520
It's steel. Armored.

30:43.600 --> 30:45.640
It can only be opened from the outside.

30:45.720 --> 30:47.400
You sound like an expert.

30:48.440 --> 30:50.000
I have done some things…

30:51.120 --> 30:53.480
Great! I'm stuck to a criminal.

30:53.560 --> 30:55.760
And you had it all handed to you
on a silver platter.

30:56.360 --> 30:57.560
Why do you say that?

30:58.200 --> 31:01.680
A young wife of an older man,
a father figure who provides for her…

31:01.760 --> 31:03.920
You always need someone to look after you.

31:04.000 --> 31:05.480
-Fuck you!
-Help me.

31:08.400 --> 31:11.600
Hey, I have a couple
of failed marriages behind me.

31:16.640 --> 31:17.920
Come on. Help me.

31:19.000 --> 31:19.840
Come on.

31:22.600 --> 31:24.200
Let's try to open the window.

31:27.240 --> 31:28.280
Lift it!

31:39.640 --> 31:40.920
Where the fuck are we?

31:42.400 --> 31:44.160
-Can you smell solvent?
-Yes.

31:44.720 --> 31:46.000
It's a paint factory.

31:46.080 --> 31:47.480
There's one by the cemetery.

31:48.000 --> 31:49.840
But it's far away from the city.

31:53.040 --> 31:53.880
Dogs.

31:57.000 --> 31:58.760
-Are you okay?
-Can't you see?

32:03.560 --> 32:04.440
Fuck.

32:10.400 --> 32:13.000
No one can help us.
We're in the middle of nowhere.

32:22.120 --> 32:25.600
If we weren't sewn to each other,
we could have gotten out the window.

32:25.680 --> 32:27.320
But we are, so it's impossible.

32:33.600 --> 32:35.480
Besides, we both are very weak.

33:03.080 --> 33:03.960
Please.

33:17.320 --> 33:18.800
We have to undo the stitches.

33:24.000 --> 33:24.960
Come on.

33:33.560 --> 33:34.720
Come on.

33:37.320 --> 33:38.600
What are you looking for?

33:39.120 --> 33:40.520
Something to cut them with.

33:49.920 --> 33:51.200
Is this our blood?

33:51.280 --> 33:54.720
Fucking hell, they totally butchered us.

34:03.000 --> 34:04.080
Bastard…

34:24.200 --> 34:25.120
Drop that!

34:25.200 --> 34:27.600
-We have to cut the stitches.
-No, don't!

34:27.680 --> 34:29.560
There's no other way. We have to…

34:29.640 --> 34:30.800
We have to do it.

34:31.360 --> 34:33.320
Can't you see your hand is shaking?

34:37.280 --> 34:38.120
Stop it!

34:42.160 --> 34:44.040
You're right, you do it.

34:45.760 --> 34:46.800
You do it. Go on.

34:51.600 --> 34:52.680
You can do it.

35:03.400 --> 35:04.360
You're doing…

35:04.960 --> 35:06.080
a great job.

35:18.960 --> 35:21.040
They've stitched us flesh to flesh.

35:22.760 --> 35:25.760
They cut out a piece of skin.

35:27.400 --> 35:28.600
Fucking bastard.

35:32.760 --> 35:34.680
What an absolute fucking bastard!

35:35.680 --> 35:37.240
Motherfucker!

35:38.520 --> 35:40.040
I swear I'll kill you!

35:40.720 --> 35:42.080
I'll kill you!

35:42.680 --> 35:43.680
Bastard.

36:02.520 --> 36:04.280
I would like to go back to the bed.

36:05.280 --> 36:06.240
Yes. Me too.

36:10.480 --> 36:11.520
Let's go.

36:30.000 --> 36:30.880
Wait…

37:28.920 --> 37:30.000
What is it?

37:32.400 --> 37:33.680
I'm starting to remember.

37:38.040 --> 37:39.280
Two days ago,

37:40.160 --> 37:43.080
a man offered me money
to sleep with his wife.

37:47.360 --> 37:49.400
His fingers caught my attention.

37:49.480 --> 37:51.880
He kept stroking his nails
with his fingertips.

37:54.280 --> 37:55.640
Starting to remember?

37:57.040 --> 37:57.880
Yes.

37:57.960 --> 38:00.200
Or have you been lying to me
this whole time?

38:01.400 --> 38:02.720
Not this again.

38:05.840 --> 38:07.240
I have problems.

38:12.280 --> 38:14.800
Sometimes, one feels obligated to do…

38:15.480 --> 38:16.880
certain things.

38:20.040 --> 38:21.280
What are you telling me?

38:22.480 --> 38:24.960
You told me your husband
was much older than you.

38:30.920 --> 38:32.320
What was that man's name?

38:34.640 --> 38:35.600
I can't remember.

38:36.560 --> 38:37.480
I thought…

38:39.200 --> 38:42.000
he was going to ask me
to have a threesome with his wife.

38:44.720 --> 38:45.720
Describe him.

38:46.440 --> 38:49.720
It was dark in the bar,
and I'd had too much to drink.

38:49.800 --> 38:50.720
Describe him.

38:53.560 --> 38:54.880
Late fifties.

38:57.080 --> 38:58.680
Gray hair and beard.

38:59.680 --> 39:00.880
Was he wearing glasses?

39:02.000 --> 39:03.120
Yes.

39:03.200 --> 39:05.400
He had big gaudy acetate glasses.

39:05.920 --> 39:06.960
It's him.

39:07.560 --> 39:09.680
Millions of men have gray hair and beard.

39:09.760 --> 39:10.920
This one is my husband.

39:12.760 --> 39:13.800
He will kill me.

39:14.480 --> 39:15.360
But…

39:16.360 --> 39:20.400
I was supposed to sleep with his wife.
I never thought he was that twisted.

39:20.480 --> 39:22.640
No one had ever offered me so much money.

39:22.720 --> 39:23.760
Eight thousand.

39:23.840 --> 39:24.960
That's a fortune.

39:25.480 --> 39:26.680
A lot of money.

39:27.400 --> 39:29.240
-And you accepted!
-Sara…

39:29.960 --> 39:31.880
-Sara!
-You fucking accepted!

39:33.960 --> 39:34.960
Calm down.

39:39.440 --> 39:40.560
Listen to me.

39:41.240 --> 39:42.120
Hey!

39:42.200 --> 39:44.520
He promised me there would be no violence.

39:44.600 --> 39:46.760
Never. I swear, I never…

39:47.360 --> 39:49.400
-You have to believe me.
-You disgust me.

39:57.280 --> 40:00.240
I have a lot of debts.
One card paying off the other.

40:00.320 --> 40:02.760
The banks don't care about your troubles,

40:02.840 --> 40:05.680
and the moneylenders show up.
It's a downward spiral.

40:07.440 --> 40:08.280
Sara…

40:10.280 --> 40:13.560
You have to believe me,
I have never hurt anyone.

40:14.480 --> 40:15.320
Look at me.

40:16.080 --> 40:18.600
Sara, I'd never lay a finger on you.

40:18.680 --> 40:20.360
Look at me, look at me.

40:21.120 --> 40:21.960
I am…

40:22.960 --> 40:23.840
really sorry.

40:24.360 --> 40:25.280
I really am.

40:25.920 --> 40:26.760
I only…

40:27.280 --> 40:28.120
Calm down!

40:31.160 --> 40:32.000
Stop it!

40:32.600 --> 40:33.720
Stop it.

40:57.400 --> 40:58.320
Come on.

41:00.520 --> 41:03.000
Our only chance is to negotiate with him.

41:04.840 --> 41:06.360
-How?
-I don't know.

41:07.040 --> 41:08.560
We'll think of something.

41:09.080 --> 41:10.000
Come on.

41:14.760 --> 41:15.920
Fuck.

41:16.640 --> 41:17.520
For fuck's sake.

41:18.280 --> 41:19.160
What now?

41:21.200 --> 41:23.080
If it is Mario, he won't negotiate.

41:23.160 --> 41:25.040
We have to keep a cool head.

41:25.120 --> 41:25.960
Okay?

41:31.280 --> 41:32.320
Come on.

41:34.280 --> 41:35.360
Leave this to me.

41:35.880 --> 41:37.200
I know how to talk to him.

41:37.840 --> 41:41.520
Firm, calm, and never, ever,
raise your voice.

41:41.600 --> 41:42.640
Okay.

41:45.200 --> 41:46.320
<i>Hello, you two.</i>

41:46.960 --> 41:48.360
<i>Do you like the room?</i>

41:57.880 --> 41:59.520
Why are you doing this to us?

41:59.600 --> 42:01.320
Please, let us go.

42:01.400 --> 42:02.520
<i>Calm down.</i>

42:02.600 --> 42:04.520
Why have you done this to us?

42:04.600 --> 42:06.040
You fucking bastard!

42:06.680 --> 42:08.880
You sick motherfucker!

42:08.960 --> 42:12.120
Fuck you and your mother,
you fucking asshole!

42:22.240 --> 42:23.160
I'm sorry.

42:24.400 --> 42:25.880
I couldn't help it.

42:26.840 --> 42:28.080
It wasn't him.

42:29.400 --> 42:30.320
What?

42:31.320 --> 42:32.520
It wasn't my husband.

42:33.720 --> 42:34.720
-Yes, it was.
-No.

42:34.800 --> 42:37.560
He's the one that paid me.
The voice was distorted, but…

42:37.640 --> 42:39.520
No. I'm certain it wasn't him.

42:40.840 --> 42:42.640
-Who was it then?
-I don't know.

42:44.280 --> 42:45.120
Sara…

42:45.920 --> 42:48.240
Sara, think. Do you have any enemies?

42:48.320 --> 42:50.360
-I don't know.
-Someone from college?

42:50.440 --> 42:51.720
A student, an ex-student.

42:51.800 --> 42:54.760
Your husband seems like an asshole.
I'm sure he has enemies.

42:54.840 --> 42:55.800
I don't know.

42:55.880 --> 42:58.160
Try to remember, Sara.
Try to remember. Think!

42:58.240 --> 42:59.680
Look. Look at the photo.

42:59.760 --> 43:00.760
Look at it.

43:00.840 --> 43:03.000
Does the name Rita mean anything to you?

43:11.240 --> 43:12.160
The earrings.

43:12.680 --> 43:14.600
They are the ones that I'm wearing.

43:17.200 --> 43:18.200
Who is Rita?

43:19.320 --> 43:21.840
-I don't know.
-Sara, try to remember. Who is Rita?

43:21.920 --> 43:24.400
A friend of your husband's?
A relative of yours?

43:24.480 --> 43:26.160
Sara, think. Try to remember.

43:26.240 --> 43:27.240
Try to remember.

43:27.320 --> 43:28.160
Sara.

43:29.920 --> 43:31.200
Sara. Are you okay?

43:31.280 --> 43:32.240
Stay calm.

43:32.320 --> 43:33.960
Stay calm.

43:34.040 --> 43:34.880
Come.

43:35.640 --> 43:36.760
Breathe.

43:37.360 --> 43:38.400
Breathe. Calm down.

43:41.520 --> 43:42.560
Let's calm down.

43:42.640 --> 43:44.120
And not think about anything.

43:46.480 --> 43:47.960
Give our minds a rest.

43:50.240 --> 43:51.280
Breathe.

43:58.440 --> 43:59.760
I don't like flying.

44:03.560 --> 44:06.400
When I travel by plane,
I always close my eyes.

44:07.080 --> 44:08.840
Take a few deep breaths.

44:10.400 --> 44:11.400
Count to ten.

44:17.280 --> 44:18.320
And exhale.

44:19.840 --> 44:24.240
If we hit turbulence, I think about
what I want to do when we land.

44:26.080 --> 44:29.560
I already know what I'm going to do
if we get out of here.

44:33.520 --> 44:34.400
You do?

44:36.160 --> 44:37.840
I'm going to ask for a divorce.

44:45.560 --> 44:47.480
Do you still think it was him?

44:47.560 --> 44:48.720
I don't know…

44:49.520 --> 44:50.760
but it wasn't his voice.

44:53.320 --> 44:55.600
How could you marry a man like that?

44:58.120 --> 45:00.680
I started dating Mario

45:02.880 --> 45:05.120
not long after my father died.

45:07.400 --> 45:08.920
He made me feel safe, I guess.

45:11.440 --> 45:13.400
But then all the jealousy kicked in.

45:15.560 --> 45:17.320
He'd stay in his office all day.

45:17.920 --> 45:19.360
He'd barely speak to me.

45:20.000 --> 45:21.080
He'd lose his temper.

45:22.000 --> 45:23.800
But I never stood up for myself…

45:24.880 --> 45:26.080
because I'm a coward.

45:26.760 --> 45:29.000
-You're very brave.
-I'm not.

45:29.080 --> 45:30.200
You're showing it now.

45:31.320 --> 45:32.240
Get real.

45:37.520 --> 45:38.400
Get real.

45:41.320 --> 45:42.160
Does he hit you?

45:49.520 --> 45:51.240
What a fucking bastard.

45:52.840 --> 45:54.520
He's blocked all my credit cards.

45:55.800 --> 45:56.880
I'm broke.

45:58.720 --> 46:00.760
You probably can't stand being alone.

46:01.680 --> 46:02.960
Where's that coming from?

46:03.560 --> 46:05.360
Oh no, I'm not judging you.

46:06.760 --> 46:08.720
I can't stand being alone either.

46:10.560 --> 46:11.600
I hate it.

46:12.360 --> 46:14.600
I spent my childhood in foster homes.

46:16.080 --> 46:17.280
Luckily, I have Goldie.

46:18.440 --> 46:19.320
Yes.

46:19.400 --> 46:20.520
He's one grateful dog.

46:21.040 --> 46:22.480
He was abandoned too.

46:25.320 --> 46:26.760
When I was a child,

46:27.840 --> 46:30.600
I envied the kids that had siblings.

46:31.480 --> 46:32.600
Me too.

46:36.720 --> 46:37.880
Are you feeling better?

46:40.480 --> 46:42.920
If we don't get out of here,
we're going to die.

46:47.520 --> 46:51.520
Either the wounds get infected
or our bodies reject each other.

46:51.600 --> 46:53.680
Unless we're the same blood type.

46:54.720 --> 46:57.640
You're lucky, as I'm a universal donor.

46:59.480 --> 47:00.440
So am I.

47:07.800 --> 47:09.400
Here, right here.

47:17.880 --> 47:18.880
What's in that box?

47:33.480 --> 47:34.600
It's warm.

47:35.800 --> 47:36.760
What's in the box?

47:43.040 --> 47:44.480
No. Don't touch it. Don't.

47:44.560 --> 47:47.080
It's obvious he wants to play with us.

47:50.040 --> 47:50.880
Okay.

47:51.480 --> 47:52.360
Let's play then.

48:00.400 --> 48:01.720
You won't believe this.

48:01.800 --> 48:02.640
What?

48:07.000 --> 48:08.120
Lasagna?

48:08.760 --> 48:10.080
My favorite food.

48:10.160 --> 48:11.440
And I love meatloaf.

48:11.520 --> 48:13.280
No, wait. What are you doing?

48:13.360 --> 48:15.320
-I'm starving.
-What if it's poisoned?

48:15.400 --> 48:17.880
If I'm going to die,
I may as well do it on a full stomach.

48:30.600 --> 48:32.360
How did you know about the cameras?

48:34.880 --> 48:35.840
I already told you.

48:36.360 --> 48:37.280
Tell me the truth.

48:40.440 --> 48:43.280
That remote control
activates the cameras remotely.

48:44.000 --> 48:45.080
How do you know that?

48:47.120 --> 48:50.280
Sometimes I installed cameras
in the places where I had dates.

48:51.640 --> 48:52.480
Why?

48:56.720 --> 48:59.520
I used the recordings
to blackmail my clients.

49:03.960 --> 49:05.840
-Hey! Are you insane?
-You disgust me!

49:05.920 --> 49:08.760
-How does that change anything?
-You're his accomplice!

49:08.840 --> 49:11.080
I told you the truth
so you could trust me.

49:11.160 --> 49:13.720
-I need space!
-We're sewn together.

49:13.800 --> 49:15.760
What part of that don't you understand?

49:16.440 --> 49:17.800
Mario, that's enough!

49:18.840 --> 49:20.200
Mario, can you hear me?

49:20.280 --> 49:22.480
You were right! Are you happy now?

49:23.040 --> 49:24.480
I was cheating on you!

49:25.240 --> 49:27.360
I cheated on you, Mario!

49:28.120 --> 49:29.400
All the time!

49:58.880 --> 50:00.840
He doesn't want us to kiss.

50:06.280 --> 50:07.240
How so?

50:08.480 --> 50:12.320
When we kissed before,
the lights went out too.

50:56.800 --> 50:57.880
Enough!

50:59.440 --> 51:00.400
Enough!

51:01.680 --> 51:04.400
While you're here,
you will do as I say. Is that clear?

51:09.720 --> 51:10.560
That's enough.

51:11.360 --> 51:12.920
-The door is open.
-Enough!

51:14.640 --> 51:15.720
Stop that!

51:28.320 --> 51:30.160
He's the one that gave me the money.

51:31.640 --> 51:33.160
He's disguised as my husband.

51:34.720 --> 51:36.720
He wanted to meet by the old station.

51:39.360 --> 51:40.480
-Come on.
-Let's go.

51:43.400 --> 51:44.240
Is he dead?

51:44.840 --> 51:45.760
I don't know.

52:02.280 --> 52:03.160
Wait.

52:11.200 --> 52:15.160
<i>Young mother gives birth</i>
<i>to Siamese twins of opposite sexes.</i>

52:16.320 --> 52:19.160
<i>The only known case in the whole world.</i>

52:20.160 --> 52:23.680
<i>Conjoined babies</i>
<i>to become part of foster system.</i>

52:24.560 --> 52:28.080
<i>The father has been diagnosed</i>
<i>with paranoid schizophrenia.</i>

52:28.880 --> 52:32.360
<i>The mother of the twins died</i>
<i>after giving birth.</i>

52:33.000 --> 52:34.840
<i>The mother.</i>

52:34.920 --> 52:36.200
<i>The mother.</i>

52:37.800 --> 52:39.080
Do you recognize her?

52:39.760 --> 52:40.920
Rita.

52:44.560 --> 52:45.520
I lied to you…

52:46.480 --> 52:49.720
when I said I was 33 years old.

52:51.280 --> 52:52.200
On May 4th…

52:54.880 --> 52:56.480
I turned 38.

52:59.560 --> 53:00.880
On May 4th…

53:08.200 --> 53:10.320
I was born in La Casa de la Caridad.

53:10.400 --> 53:12.440
I was born in Santa Marta clinic.

53:14.360 --> 53:16.360
They forged the birth certificate.

53:20.240 --> 53:22.760
I have… a scar.

53:27.520 --> 53:28.480
Where?

53:51.800 --> 53:53.400
-Get back.
-Yes.

53:56.560 --> 53:58.120
I thought it was raining.

53:58.200 --> 54:01.800
We're on the first floor. We're saved!
We can get out through the window.

54:01.880 --> 54:03.240
What's going on?

54:13.360 --> 54:14.480
It's a painting.

54:16.080 --> 54:17.320
It's all fake.

54:21.160 --> 54:22.000
Wait…

54:22.800 --> 54:23.840
I can't breathe.

54:25.920 --> 54:27.840
No, breathe.

54:27.920 --> 54:28.880
Breathe.

54:28.960 --> 54:30.760
Breathe. No.

54:30.840 --> 54:32.560
No. We can't give up now, okay?

54:33.440 --> 54:34.320
Come on.

54:35.560 --> 54:37.000
Breathe, please.

54:37.520 --> 54:38.720
-I can't.
-Come on.

54:40.840 --> 54:41.880
Come on, let's go!

54:47.640 --> 54:48.760
Hold on and breathe.

55:21.680 --> 55:23.520
God, they're stitched together.

55:28.040 --> 55:29.000
My Beretta.

55:30.320 --> 55:31.200
Wait, what?

55:31.800 --> 55:32.720
It's mine.

55:33.920 --> 55:35.200
Why do you have a gun?

55:36.040 --> 55:38.400
It's not only men that like guns.

55:39.080 --> 55:40.040
I don't like them.

55:41.840 --> 55:43.800
I took it to my meeting with Mario.

55:44.960 --> 55:46.640
When were you going to tell me?

55:47.760 --> 55:48.960
What's it for?

55:50.560 --> 55:52.640
Sara, please, put it down.

55:53.920 --> 55:54.880
Put it down.

55:55.560 --> 55:56.600
Just in case.

56:15.200 --> 56:16.120
Mario…

56:17.040 --> 56:18.280
Is this your husband?

56:21.040 --> 56:22.400
Did you kill him?

56:27.400 --> 56:28.760
I… I don't know.

56:35.360 --> 56:36.400
It was me.

56:40.400 --> 56:42.520
I met him when I was looking for Sara.

56:43.840 --> 56:44.880
I investigated.

56:45.640 --> 56:46.640
And I learned.

56:47.840 --> 56:50.880
When I found out
that two was the key to everything,

56:52.520 --> 56:55.080
I knew I had to bring you back together.

56:56.480 --> 56:57.840
You will live here,

56:57.920 --> 56:59.120
with me.

57:05.120 --> 57:08.160
The Bunker brothers never felt lonely.

57:10.480 --> 57:11.840
They got married.

57:12.760 --> 57:15.320
And between them they had 23 children.

57:19.640 --> 57:21.600
I did it for your own good.

57:22.440 --> 57:24.400
-Let's move towards the door.
-Yes.

57:24.920 --> 57:27.760
You're beautiful, just like Rita.

57:30.360 --> 57:31.480
Don't come any closer.

57:35.960 --> 57:38.280
You wouldn't dare shoot your father.

57:56.800 --> 57:58.400
-Sara.
-David.

57:58.920 --> 57:59.760
Are you okay?

57:59.840 --> 58:00.720
Yeah. You?

58:04.360 --> 58:06.080
-I can't move.
-What?

58:12.440 --> 58:13.360
My leg.

58:18.520 --> 58:19.760
You have to find help.

58:20.560 --> 58:22.200
I can't hold on for much longer.

58:23.160 --> 58:24.120
How?

58:35.120 --> 58:37.040
I can see a letter opener! Come on.

58:40.760 --> 58:41.800
Get closer.

58:44.400 --> 58:45.640
I got it.

58:46.840 --> 58:47.920
I got it. Here.

58:48.000 --> 58:48.840
Come on.

58:49.480 --> 58:51.560
-Separate yourself from me.
-What?

58:51.640 --> 58:53.760
We won't get anywhere together.

58:53.840 --> 58:55.720
-Come on.
-I can't do that.

58:56.320 --> 58:57.160
Do it.

58:58.120 --> 59:00.800
Otherwise, we will both die.

59:03.480 --> 59:04.400
Do it.

59:16.520 --> 59:17.400
It's too blunt.

59:18.520 --> 59:19.720
It doesn't cut.

59:32.960 --> 59:33.840
Try again.

1:00:03.320 --> 1:00:04.400
Hold on, please.

1:00:09.600 --> 1:00:13.360
I'll wait for the turbulence to pass.

1:00:18.120 --> 1:00:19.280
I'll be back with help.

1:01:58.480 --> 1:01:59.400
Sara.

1:02:03.040 --> 1:02:05.720
Apart, you're weak.

1:02:08.000 --> 1:02:10.520
Together, you're perfect.

1:02:19.600 --> 1:02:24.000
The Bunker brothers led a full life.

1:02:25.240 --> 1:02:27.160
First, one of them died.

1:02:27.880 --> 1:02:30.680
Two hours later, his brother.

1:02:35.800 --> 1:02:38.480
You're not going anywhere.
