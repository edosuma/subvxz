00:39.421 --> 00:41.046

00:41.255 --> 00:43.505
<i>you'll pass on all your junk to your kids,</i>

00:43.796 --> 00:45.921
<i>and it'll become their problem</i>

00:46.005 --> 00:47.046

00:49.421 --> 00:50.255
<i>Guess what?</i>

00:50.796 --> 00:52.171
<i>I never had any kids.</i>

00:52.255 --> 00:54.838
<i>And I've got a whole lot of junk.</i>

00:55.755 --> 00:56.713
Morning.

00:56.796 --> 00:58.296
- Hi.
-Can I help with anything?

00:58.380 --> 01:00.296
-You want anything?
-Thank you. Just looking.

01:03.046 --> 01:05.046
<i>So, here I am.</i>

01:11.255 --> 01:12.880
I'll give it to you for 30. It's okay.

01:12.963 --> 01:14.046
You can have this, look.

01:15.421 --> 01:16.421
-That's 15.
-Yeah, thanks.

01:16.505 --> 01:18.463
Got that? Thirty-five.

01:18.546 --> 01:19.921
I just love estate sales.

01:20.005 --> 01:23.755
You know, 'cause they, like,
give you a glimpse into a person's life.

01:24.296 --> 01:25.255
Eighty-three fifty.

01:26.880 --> 01:28.380
Did you know the owner?

01:29.796 --> 01:31.630
-I did.
-How did she die?

01:32.421 --> 01:33.255
Cancer.

01:33.755 --> 01:36.255
Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that.
Who was she?

01:38.380 --> 01:39.255
Nice choice.

01:41.588 --> 01:42.755
Thank you very much.

01:50.255 --> 01:54.380
<i>I have lived</i>
<i>in this same apartment for 46 years.</i>

Oh, my goodness! You must be Martha!

05:17.588 --> 05:18.755
Huh? Oh.

05:18.838 --> 05:20.088
I'm Vicki.

05:20.213 --> 05:22.046
-This is Gayle and Barbara.
-Hey!

05:22.130 --> 05:24.255
-Hello!
-We are the welcoming committee.

05:25.505 --> 05:27.171
And this is for you.

05:28.130 --> 05:29.630
Oh. Oh! Ah!

05:29.713 --> 05:31.005
-I'm sorry!
-Excuse me. I'm sorry.

05:31.088 --> 05:33.005
-That's fine. Don't worry about it.
-You got it.

05:33.088 --> 05:35.463
-Anyway...
-Just a little southern hospitality.

05:35.963 --> 05:38.130
Now, what brings you to Sun Springs?

05:38.380 --> 05:39.671
Oh, I'm just here to die.

05:41.130 --> 05:44.213
Well, I think we can aim
a little bit higher than that.

05:46.380 --> 05:48.380
Let's get started with the tour.

05:49.213 --> 05:50.713
-Uh-huh.
-What do you mean, the tour?

05:50.796 --> 05:52.171
-You're official!
-Wait, whoa.

05:52.255 --> 05:54.463
-Yeah, let's go.
-You gotta protect that pretty skin.

05:54.546 --> 05:56.921
-Oh, yeah.
-If you're gonna tackle this one.

05:57.005 --> 05:59.213
- So sorry.
-We'll put that in your front yard.

05:59.296 --> 06:02.088
All right, put your hands up!
Come on, don't be lazy!

06:02.171 --> 06:04.838
We've got everything you could ever need.

06:04.921 --> 06:07.671
We've got three golf courses,

06:07.838 --> 06:09.380
two bowling alleys,

06:09.630 --> 06:11.588
oh, an indoor pool,

06:11.671 --> 06:14.171
and the outdoor pool.

06:14.255 --> 06:15.838
-The works.
-Yeah.

06:16.088 --> 06:17.213
I always say,

06:17.713 --> 06:19.630
if you are bored in Sun Springs,

06:19.713 --> 06:21.296
you just need to be watered.

06:22.296 --> 06:23.255
-It's true.
-Yeah.

06:23.338 --> 06:25.005
-She always says that.
-She does.

06:25.671 --> 06:27.005
Let's move on.

06:28.921 --> 06:32.713
All our residents are required to join
at least one club.

06:32.796 --> 06:33.671
Oh.

06:33.755 --> 06:36.088
Now, there are over 100 of 'em.

06:36.171 --> 06:41.005
In the unlikely event that you can't find
the right club for you,

06:41.755 --> 06:43.255
-fun fact!
-What?

06:43.338 --> 06:45.130
You can start your own!

06:45.796 --> 06:49.130
Gayle and I started a club
called the Southern Belles.

06:49.213 --> 06:50.630
Oh, is that a fact, Vicki?

06:50.713 --> 06:51.921
I'm not allowed to join.

06:52.796 --> 06:56.463
It's called the Southern Belles.
It's not called the Wisconsin Belles.

06:56.755 --> 06:59.630
I don't know how many times
I have to explain that to you.

07:00.796 --> 07:04.588
Oh, and the biggest event of the year
is the Senior Showcase.

07:04.671 --> 07:05.546
-Oh.
-Oh, my God!

07:05.630 --> 07:06.463
Really?

07:06.546 --> 07:10.338
All of Sun Springs' talent on one stage.

07:10.421 --> 07:13.630
The whole community
comes out to watch. It's a real hoot.

07:13.921 --> 07:15.130
You're gonna love it, Martha.

07:15.213 --> 07:16.546
Well, I mean, I'll, uh...

07:16.630 --> 07:20.046
Obviously, I will be sure
and check my calendar.

07:20.130 --> 07:21.671
-Great.
-But if you'll excuse me, ladies,

07:21.755 --> 07:23.255
I just want to say thanks for the tour.

07:23.338 --> 07:25.046
I should get going, though.
I really should--

07:25.130 --> 07:27.880
Wait. No, you haven't done
your safety training.

07:28.005 --> 07:28.921
My what?

07:29.005 --> 07:30.421
Safety training.

07:30.880 --> 07:31.880
Uh-huh.

07:32.130 --> 07:35.671
As Chief of Security,
it's my job to keep our residents safe.

07:36.005 --> 07:38.796
I run a team of highly trained volunteers,
just like Dorris here.

07:38.880 --> 07:39.921
Say hi, Dorris.

07:40.005 --> 07:41.796
-Hi!
-Hello, Dorris.

07:43.171 --> 07:44.880
All tips are anonymous.

07:45.130 --> 07:47.130
So if you see something, say something.

07:47.213 --> 07:48.255
Like what?

07:48.338 --> 07:49.671
Overgrown hedges.

07:50.088 --> 07:51.880
Excessive lawn ornamentation.

07:51.963 --> 07:55.380
If someone has their Christmas lights on
past New Years, that's a big one.

07:55.463 --> 07:56.296
Very big.

07:57.505 --> 07:59.880
Well,  are you authorized
to use deadly force?

08:00.463 --> 08:01.380
Excuse me?

08:01.463 --> 08:03.380
Well, let's just say it's July

08:03.463 --> 08:06.171
and my neighbor hasn't taken down
his Christmas lights.

08:06.463 --> 08:08.380
Are you gonna have the guts
to do what it takes?

08:08.713 --> 08:09.546
Well...

08:10.838 --> 08:13.088
mostly we just issue citations.

08:13.380 --> 08:15.838
I'm glad you find this so amusing!

08:42.921 --> 08:43.796
Oh!

08:53.921 --> 08:54.755
Oh.

09:22.296 --> 09:23.463
Oh, my God.

09:31.005 --> 09:31.838
Oh.

09:33.130 --> 09:35.713
-Hi! Moving in?
-Oh. Yeah.

09:35.796 --> 09:38.630
I was hoping you'd be a man.

09:39.546 --> 09:40.505
Excuse me?

09:40.588 --> 09:45.380
Did you know single women outlive
single men by almost ten years?

09:45.463 --> 09:49.463
And Lord knows there's not enough
erections around here as it is.

09:49.546 --> 09:51.588
Oh, we're talkin' erections, huh?  Wow.

09:51.671 --> 09:53.546
I'm Sheryl.

09:53.630 --> 09:54.630
-Sheryl.
-I live next door.

09:54.713 --> 09:57.713
-Yes, Sheryl. Good to meet you.
-Hey, you don't play poker, do you?

09:57.796 --> 10:00.380
Because I run a weekly game,

10:00.463 --> 10:03.130
and we could sure use another player.

10:03.213 --> 10:07.088
It's all very hush-hush because
gambling's not allowed around here,

10:07.171 --> 10:08.963
like most things that are worthwhile.

10:09.046 --> 10:12.046
You should drop by tonight
and say hi to the guys.

10:12.130 --> 10:13.630
God, you know, it's been a very...

10:13.713 --> 10:16.338
Look, it's a long day for me.
I just moved in, and...

10:16.421 --> 10:18.338
But thanks,
I really appreciate what you're...

10:18.421 --> 10:20.088
-The invitation's sweet.
-I get it.

10:20.171 --> 10:22.546
It's really nice.
Thanks so much for coming by.

10:22.921 --> 10:24.588
- See ya.
- Great.

10:24.796 --> 10:27.130
Ugh, God. Bye!

10:27.713 --> 10:28.713
Okay.

10:42.213 --> 10:43.296
Oh, my God.

10:43.713 --> 10:44.546
Okay.

10:45.088 --> 10:46.130
That's it.

10:54.380 --> 10:55.713
- Okay.

10:55.796 --> 10:56.963
Let's go. Move it.

10:57.713 --> 11:00.088
- I'll play! You want one or two?
- Hey!

11:00.171 --> 11:01.213
Oh, God damn it.

11:02.546 --> 11:03.671
Hello?

11:03.755 --> 11:04.838
Oh, God.

11:12.546 --> 11:13.380
Hello?

11:14.755 --> 11:15.588
Yes.

11:16.338 --> 11:18.296
We'll send somebody right over.

11:19.296 --> 11:20.505
Hey, Chief.

11:20.588 --> 11:21.630
What is it, Dorris?

11:21.713 --> 11:27.088
Well, we got a 314 in progress
over there on Pleasant Valley Drive.

11:27.171 --> 11:28.421
Somebody's getting raped?

11:28.880 --> 11:29.713
Well, now...

11:30.671 --> 11:31.671
Mmm...

11:33.546 --> 11:34.838
What's a noise complaint?

11:34.921 --> 11:36.005
That's a 315.

11:37.046 --> 11:38.671
Oh. Well, yeah, that's the one.

11:40.588 --> 11:41.921
Let's go, let's go!

11:43.255 --> 11:44.130
Come on.

11:47.880 --> 11:48.921
-Oh!

11:55.130 --> 11:55.963
Oh.

11:56.046 --> 11:59.338
Hey! You didn't call the cops on me,
did you?

11:59.755 --> 12:03.463
Because if there's a problem,
I hope you can just come straight to me.

12:03.546 --> 12:06.463
Well, of course.
I mean, the same goes for you.

12:06.546 --> 12:09.546
Good. We need somewhere to hide.

12:09.630 --> 12:11.546
-We?
-Come on, guys.

12:12.630 --> 12:13.880
I'm sorry, but...

12:13.963 --> 12:16.463
- This'll work! Over here!
- I'll set this up.

12:17.046 --> 12:18.296
- Well, I--
-Howdy!

12:18.380 --> 12:19.588
-Ma'am.
-Hello.

12:35.130 --> 12:37.088
- Get this out the way.
- Hey, Martha.

12:37.171 --> 12:38.505
- Mm-hmm.
-You want a beer?

12:38.588 --> 12:40.380
Uh, no, no. Thanks so much.

12:40.463 --> 12:42.796
- Let's do it! Here we go!
- Okay, let's go.

12:42.880 --> 12:43.921
Oh, snacks!

12:44.005 --> 12:45.255
Mm-hmm. There you go.

12:45.338 --> 12:47.171
Sorry about the intrusion.

12:47.255 --> 12:49.171
No, that's fine.
That's absolutely fine.

12:49.255 --> 12:53.463
I really love having strange men
in my house at all hours of the night.

12:57.421 --> 12:58.755
But who is that?

12:58.838 --> 13:01.671
Oh, that's, uh, Ben.
He's Sheryl's gardener.

13:01.755 --> 13:03.046
- Really?

13:03.380 --> 13:04.463
- God.
- Uh-huh.

13:04.546 --> 13:05.588
Uh-huh.

13:05.671 --> 13:07.088
Okay, thank you.

13:08.255 --> 13:10.130
-All right.
-All right. Come on. Ante up now.

13:10.213 --> 13:12.213
- What is this?
- No, that's rubbish.

13:13.213 --> 13:14.046
Oh.

13:14.130 --> 13:15.255
-Evening, ma'am.
-Evening.

13:15.338 --> 13:17.046
I just wanted to follow up on your call.

13:17.130 --> 13:19.296
Oh, well, don't worry.
Everything's absolutely fine now.

13:19.380 --> 13:21.671
-No, ma'am. I'm afraid it is not.
-Huh?

13:21.755 --> 13:23.296
It's never that quiet over there.

13:23.380 --> 13:25.213
I didn't see anyone in the house,

13:25.963 --> 13:28.296
but there were clear signs of subterfuge.

13:28.380 --> 13:29.296
Subterfuge?

13:29.380 --> 13:32.046
Yes, ma'am.
It's like chicanery or evasion.

13:33.088 --> 13:35.505
I just want you to know
that Dorris and I will be on stake-out.

13:37.005 --> 13:40.421
- Mm-hmm.
-Thank you. All right, bye.

13:42.005 --> 13:44.213
- That's for me, Hank.
- All right.

13:44.296 --> 13:45.963
Here we go. It's on you, Sheryl.

13:46.046 --> 13:47.046
Hey, Martha!

13:47.463 --> 13:48.671
You want a beer?

13:50.130 --> 13:52.380
- You wanna play? We're raising.

13:52.463 --> 13:53.296
Good night, everyone.

13:53.380 --> 13:54.796
- Bye now.
-We'll whisper.

13:57.171 --> 13:59.921
-Pay up, boys!
-Just shut up!

14:02.838 --> 14:04.796
God, I can't take it.

14:12.880 --> 14:14.005
- Hey!

14:14.088 --> 14:15.338
-Hey there!
-Oh, whoa!

14:15.421 --> 14:16.755
-Whoa, whoa, whoa.

14:16.838 --> 14:18.421
-Yeah, hi, hello.
-Hey.

14:18.755 --> 14:20.630
I wanna take you to lunch.

14:20.713 --> 14:23.546
-That isn't really necessary.
-To say thank you for last night.

14:23.630 --> 14:28.088
-Whoa! What a night, right?
-Come on, I don't take no for an answer!

14:28.171 --> 14:29.296
I gathered that.

14:29.380 --> 14:31.713
I bet you haven't got other plans.

14:32.505 --> 14:33.755
-Okay, fine.
-Then hop in.

14:33.838 --> 14:36.005
-Hop in. We'll be late.
-I got it. I'll get in right now.

14:36.088 --> 14:38.130
-This'll be...
-I promise you'll love it.

14:38.421 --> 14:40.338
<i>♪ Playing with the Queen of Hearts ♪</i>

14:41.796 --> 14:43.755
So what brings you
to Sun Springs?

14:44.338 --> 14:47.880
Well, I heard really good things
about the  Southern Belles.

14:47.963 --> 14:50.421
- The Southern Belles.
-Yeah.

14:50.505 --> 14:51.796
Gimme a break.

14:51.880 --> 14:55.130
Bunch of mean, old gals
and their stupid club.

14:55.213 --> 14:56.463
- Sheryl!
-Hi!

14:56.546 --> 14:57.588
Good to see ya!

14:57.671 --> 14:58.546
Hey.

14:59.588 --> 15:01.046
What clubs do you belong to?

15:01.130 --> 15:03.338
Well, I just turn up,
pretend I'm interested,

15:03.421 --> 15:04.921
and eat all the free food.

15:05.380 --> 15:08.171
Will we be seeing you perform
at the Senior Showcase

15:08.255 --> 15:09.630
I've heard so much about?

15:09.713 --> 15:10.588
Oh, no.

15:10.671 --> 15:13.338
My only talents are poker and poking.

15:14.630 --> 15:15.630
Poker and poking?

15:17.088 --> 15:18.380
Where are you taking me?

15:33.671 --> 15:35.255
The real perk about this place...

15:36.046 --> 15:38.755
is that people are constantly dying.

15:39.171 --> 15:41.963
They list all the funerals in the papers,

15:42.046 --> 15:44.546
and there's always tons of free food.

15:46.255 --> 15:48.921
-Here, put this in your purse.
-No, no, no, no. No.

15:49.005 --> 15:51.171
Put it in your own purse, okay?
Thanks.

15:51.255 --> 15:52.963
Well, mine's already full.
Just shove it in.

15:53.046 --> 15:55.005
-No, I don't really want to.
-Oh, okay.

15:55.713 --> 15:57.630
Shall we go pay our respects?

16:09.255 --> 16:11.463
-Okay, I'm outta here.
-Do you want to have a drink?

16:11.546 --> 16:13.880
No, no, I'll have a drink later, thanks.
I'm outta here.

16:27.838 --> 16:29.838
<i>Hey, Martha! It's Sheryl!</i>

16:29.921 --> 16:33.046
<i>We're going to bingo</i>
<i>and we'd love for you to join us.</i>

16:33.130 --> 16:34.588

<i>Listen, I'm sorry</i>

16:36.505 --> 16:38.255
about taking you to that wake.

16:38.338 --> 16:40.671
I know you didn't like it. I'm sorry.

16:40.755 --> 16:41.671
It was...

16:41.755 --> 16:42.588
Anyway,

16:42.963 --> 16:44.171
<i>give me a call, would you?</i>

16:44.255 --> 16:45.505

16:45.588 --> 16:47.880
<i>I'd love to... You know, bingo's fun.</i>

16:54.005 --> 16:57.171
<i>Oh, hi, Martha.</i>
<i>I was hoping you'd pick up.</i>

16:57.255 --> 17:00.046
<i>We're going bowling</i>
<i>and we'd love you to join us.</i>

17:00.130 --> 17:01.088
<i>I can teach you.</i>

17:01.171 --> 17:03.005
<i>It's simple. It's all in the wrist.</i>

17:03.088 --> 17:04.796
<i>So give a call, why don't you?</i>

17:06.046 --> 17:07.046
Bye!

17:13.380 --> 17:14.213
Oh.

17:16.588 --> 17:17.421
Oh.

17:20.255 --> 17:21.671
<i>I'm Tim Nichols.</i>

17:22.130 --> 17:24.255
<i>Now, death can be expensive.</i>

17:26.588 --> 17:29.713

<i>the funeral and cemetery fees,</i>

17:29.796 --> 17:31.421

<i>If you ever wondered</i>
<i>if there's a better way,</i>

17:35.838 --> 17:38.171

17:46.380 --> 17:49.005
<i>I guarantee they'll get a bang out of it.</i>

18:02.671 --> 18:03.505
What?

18:04.630 --> 18:05.463
What?

18:10.921 --> 18:12.630
Oh, my God, what is this?

18:21.630 --> 18:24.088
What the hell are you doing?!

18:24.171 --> 18:25.421
What am I doing?

18:25.755 --> 18:28.338
Oh, my God! I thought you were a burglar!

18:28.421 --> 18:31.588
You haven't been out of this place
for days!

18:31.671 --> 18:34.546
I thought you'd slipped in the shower
or something.

18:34.921 --> 18:37.588
I was worried the cats
were getting at you.

18:37.671 --> 18:38.796
I don't have cats.

18:39.088 --> 18:40.713
Jesus Christ!

18:40.796 --> 18:43.171
-You could've killed me with that thing!
-I know.

18:43.671 --> 18:44.796
Who are you?

18:44.963 --> 18:46.338
Let's have some wine.

18:46.421 --> 18:47.588
-Come on, let's sit down.
-Oh!

18:47.671 --> 18:48.880
Okay, yeah.

18:48.963 --> 18:50.838
Oh, my God, Jesus Christ.

18:53.463 --> 18:56.005
I'm really sorry
about being such a bitch at the wake.

18:56.088 --> 18:58.380
I was mad about something else,
and, you know,

18:58.463 --> 19:01.796
I shouldn't have
taken it out on you, and...

19:01.880 --> 19:04.755
No, I'm sorry for telling you what to do.

19:04.838 --> 19:08.088
You're a grown-ass woman.
You can do whatever you want.

19:08.171 --> 19:09.005
Yeah.

19:12.421 --> 19:13.421
What's this?

19:13.796 --> 19:16.088
Oh, no, it's just a bunch of old junk.

19:16.796 --> 19:18.296
You were a cheerleader?

19:19.046 --> 19:21.838
Oh, aren't you full of surprises?

19:21.921 --> 19:23.213
Ms. Pep Squad.

19:23.296 --> 19:24.130
Queen of the campus.

19:24.213 --> 19:26.338
Yeah, in another life,
I guess you'd call it.

19:26.421 --> 19:31.380
I used to just come running home
so that I could practice all afternoon,

19:31.463 --> 19:34.171
and it drove my mom totally crazy.

19:34.796 --> 19:36.005
That's how bad I wanted it.

19:36.505 --> 19:37.338
Yeah.

19:37.588 --> 19:40.963
And I tried out three times
and I never made the cut.

19:41.046 --> 19:42.046
But get this.

19:42.421 --> 19:43.963
Finally, in my senior year,

19:44.755 --> 19:46.005
I made the varsity squad.

19:46.088 --> 19:47.255
Better late than never!

19:47.338 --> 19:49.880
Yeah. On the day before our first game...

19:51.338 --> 19:56.796
I found out
that my mother was very sick, so...

19:58.130 --> 19:58.963
I, uh...

20:01.671 --> 20:04.463
I quit the team, you know,
started to take care of her.

20:06.880 --> 20:09.171
Man, you know.  Oh, my God. I...

20:09.380 --> 20:11.255
You know, I never...

20:11.338 --> 20:13.255
I never did perform.

20:14.046 --> 20:15.546
- Oh.
-No, that's...

20:16.046 --> 20:18.546
Maybe you should give it another shot.

20:18.630 --> 20:21.338
Yeah, maybe the Dallas Cowgirls
have an opening, right?

20:23.046 --> 20:23.880
Yeah.

20:24.713 --> 20:26.088
-You know what?
-What?

20:26.171 --> 20:28.213
I really love this.

20:28.296 --> 20:31.380
- Mm-hmm.
-I think it's kinda... sexy.

20:31.796 --> 20:33.255
Don't you think?

20:33.338 --> 20:34.338
Uh, hey...

20:34.421 --> 20:36.338
Could I borrow this?

20:36.421 --> 20:37.588
-No.

20:38.046 --> 20:38.880
No, I can't?

20:38.963 --> 20:40.880
-No, of course you can!

20:40.963 --> 20:44.505
'Cause I'm taking pictures
for my Jdate profile.

20:44.838 --> 20:46.005
I didn't know you were Jewish.

20:46.296 --> 20:47.130
Oh, I'm not.

20:48.171 --> 20:49.005
Hey.

20:50.671 --> 20:52.546
I'm glad you're not cat food.

20:52.963 --> 20:54.963
Yeah, thanks.

20:55.421 --> 20:57.296
-See ya.
-Yeah, see you.

21:46.963 --> 21:47.963
Hello?

21:48.963 --> 21:50.755
-Hello?
-Hey. Shh.

21:50.838 --> 21:51.755
Sheryl's not here.

21:52.630 --> 21:54.338
Who are you anyway? I mean...

21:54.421 --> 21:57.088
And don't give me that nonsense
about being the gardener--

21:57.171 --> 22:00.213
I live here. They don't let anyone
under 55 live here,

22:00.296 --> 22:02.171
so I gotta keep a low profile.

22:02.255 --> 22:05.088
Oh. So Sheryl likes 'em young,
does she, huh?

22:05.171 --> 22:06.171
What?

22:06.255 --> 22:07.088
Oh.

22:07.546 --> 22:09.588
-What?
-Sheryl is my-- my grandma.

22:09.671 --> 22:10.505
Oh.

22:11.255 --> 22:12.088
Yeah.

22:12.838 --> 22:14.296
And where is she anyway, huh?

22:14.546 --> 22:16.921
She substitute teaches at my school

22:17.005 --> 22:19.463
when she needs the extra cash,
so she's down there.

22:19.546 --> 22:20.588
Sheryl's a teacher?

22:22.921 --> 22:25.963
If you can call it that.
I pretend to be sick whenever she's there.

22:26.046 --> 22:27.338
It's kinda humiliating.

22:28.088 --> 22:31.130
Miss Ferris is away sick,
so we'll be watching a movie.

22:32.005 --> 22:33.588
-Yes?
-What's the movie?

22:33.671 --> 22:35.588
It's an educational video

22:35.671 --> 22:38.588
about the dangers of STDs.

22:39.005 --> 22:40.713
Are you even qualified to be teaching us?

22:41.755 --> 22:43.088
What's your name?

22:43.171 --> 22:44.005
Chloe.

22:44.421 --> 22:48.463
Well, Chloe, the state of Georgia
has surprisingly low standards

22:48.546 --> 22:50.171
for substitute teachers.

22:50.255 --> 22:51.755
If you've got a problem with that,

22:52.171 --> 22:54.171
you take it up with your congressman.

22:54.255 --> 22:57.421
Okay, but we're supposed to be studying
<i>Romeo and Juliet.</i>

22:57.505 --> 22:59.963
Well, today you'll be studying gonorrhea.

23:01.421 --> 23:02.588
<i>So you wanna have sex?</i>

23:03.088 --> 23:05.505
<i>You should know</i>
<i>what's up before getting down.</i>

23:05.588 --> 23:06.588
<i>♪ Yeah!</i> ♪

23:06.671 --> 23:09.421
<i>♪ Sex can be fun, but there's STDs ♪</i>

23:09.755 --> 23:12.505

<i>But some you can't treat ♪</i>

23:15.838 --> 23:18.755

23:18.838 --> 23:21.213
And one, two, three, four...

23:21.546 --> 23:23.296
So you're a teacher, huh?

23:24.213 --> 23:27.713
Well, I like to think of myself
as more of a life coach.

23:29.671 --> 23:30.713
I was a teacher.

23:31.171 --> 23:32.630
-Yeah?
-Yes, yes.

23:32.713 --> 23:34.005
Do you ever miss it?

23:34.671 --> 23:38.380
Sometimes. I mean, God, the hours
were long and the pay was ridiculous,

23:38.463 --> 23:39.588
but yeah, I guess I...

23:40.046 --> 23:41.088
I guess miss it.

23:41.588 --> 23:43.880
So, what are you doing here?

23:44.796 --> 23:46.421
I have an announcement to make.

23:49.296 --> 23:52.213
We're starting a cheerleading club
at Sun Springs.

23:53.880 --> 23:55.755
Is that the set-up or the punchline?

23:55.838 --> 23:58.005
No, no, no. I'm really serious, right?

23:58.296 --> 23:59.713
I mean, I have to join a club.

23:59.796 --> 24:01.713
I don't like any of their clubs, so...

24:02.338 --> 24:03.421
I'm creating my own.

24:04.046 --> 24:05.505
-Yes, come on, seriously!

24:05.588 --> 24:07.505
You do know how old you are.

24:07.588 --> 24:10.880
What's the difference? I mean, we'll learn
a few moves. There's nothing to it. I--

24:10.963 --> 24:12.630
Hey, what's this "we"?

24:13.463 --> 24:15.338
I know this sounds so crazy, but I...

24:16.588 --> 24:18.213
I can't do it without you.

24:18.296 --> 24:19.380
What's in it for me?

24:20.338 --> 24:21.505
Well, what do you want?

24:23.671 --> 24:26.130
I want you to teach Ben how to drive. He--

24:26.213 --> 24:28.421
All of the other kids
have got their license.

24:28.505 --> 24:29.713
I think he's embarrassed.

24:29.796 --> 24:32.171
I'd teach him myself,
but I don't have a car.

24:32.255 --> 24:33.588
Yeah, no, I can't do that.

24:34.005 --> 24:34.838
Cannot do that.

24:35.088 --> 24:37.588
Well, that's the deal.
Take it or leave it.

24:38.796 --> 24:42.338
You're the one who told me I should
take up cheerleading again, right?

24:42.421 --> 24:44.671
Well, I-I didn't mean literally.

24:44.755 --> 24:49.088
It was more of a metaphor for, you know,
getting laid or something.

24:49.171 --> 24:50.546
-You know.

24:51.130 --> 24:55.338
So next up we have
Martha Walker's application.

24:55.421 --> 24:56.505
Okay.

24:59.546 --> 25:00.380
Um...

25:00.880 --> 25:03.213
We're starting a cheerleading club.

25:03.755 --> 25:04.921
Well.

25:05.005 --> 25:07.296
But who will you be cheering for?

25:08.588 --> 25:09.630
Ourselves.

25:10.421 --> 25:14.463
And, of course, we will be performing
for the Senior Showcase.

25:15.213 --> 25:16.671
Oh, will you?

25:17.046 --> 25:19.588
Well, I'm sorry, but we can't allow this.

25:19.921 --> 25:22.755
Oh, come off it! Why not?

25:22.838 --> 25:25.630
Well, insurance, for one thing.

25:25.713 --> 25:28.421
There's nothing dangerous about this.
It's just for fun.

25:28.505 --> 25:32.338
Well, we also have
Sun Spring's reputation to think about.

25:32.421 --> 25:35.130
It's cheerleading, not pole dancing.

25:36.630 --> 25:37.546
Sorry.

25:40.880 --> 25:42.713
Were you ever a cheerleader, Martha?

25:43.755 --> 25:44.796
Not exactly.

25:45.255 --> 25:46.213
Well, I was.

25:46.296 --> 25:48.005
Captain of my squad.

25:48.088 --> 25:49.463
What a surprise!

25:50.171 --> 25:54.421
And it's a lot more physically demanding
than people realize.

25:54.755 --> 25:56.255
Even for younger women.

25:56.671 --> 26:00.880
And may I suggest that you form a club
that's a little more...

26:01.296 --> 26:02.630
age appropriate.

26:02.713 --> 26:04.796
Well, I do believe that you told me
that if I...

26:04.880 --> 26:08.546
if I didn't find a club
that I really liked, I could start my own.

26:09.296 --> 26:10.130
Uh...

26:10.588 --> 26:13.921
- How many members do you have?
-So far...

26:15.588 --> 26:16.505
Uh...

26:18.088 --> 26:19.255
Just two.

26:21.088 --> 26:22.213
I'm sorry.

26:22.546 --> 26:26.130
You need eight members
to form an official club.

26:26.463 --> 26:28.463
Well, then,
we're gonna find eight members.

26:28.755 --> 26:30.505
Hi, I'm Olive.

26:31.046 --> 26:33.921
I don't have any cheerleading experience,

26:34.630 --> 26:37.421
but my husband and I,
we take a tango class.

26:37.505 --> 26:38.421
Oh.

26:38.505 --> 26:41.005
It was either tango or a divorce, so--

26:41.088 --> 26:42.630
You could just show us what you've got.

26:43.255 --> 26:44.088

28:55.005 --> 28:56.796
I haven't done that in years.

29:21.380 --> 29:23.255
Wow, that was great.

29:23.338 --> 29:25.963
Where did you learn to do that?

29:26.046 --> 29:28.463
I was Miss Carney County...

29:29.046 --> 29:29.880
runner-up.

29:30.463 --> 29:32.505
1953.

29:32.588 --> 29:34.880
-Mmm.
-What did the winner do?

29:35.588 --> 29:37.421
Had sex with the judges.

29:37.796 --> 29:39.505
-Oh.

29:41.546 --> 29:43.755
Here. No speeding, okay?

29:43.963 --> 29:46.921
Do exactly what I tell you to do
when I tell you to do it.

29:47.005 --> 29:48.546
Now you've got that? You got it?

29:48.630 --> 29:50.005
-Got it.
-Okay.

29:51.338 --> 29:54.171
What you're going to do
is you're going to back up

29:54.463 --> 29:57.171
and look in your mirrors. Right? Go ahead.

29:57.255 --> 29:59.338
Look, that's good. That's good.
Back up a little.

29:59.421 --> 30:01.713
Nice and easy. Pretty good.
Right there, that's enough.

30:01.796 --> 30:05.130
Now, I want you to pull forward
and signal.

30:05.213 --> 30:06.505
Okay? Pull forward.

30:07.671 --> 30:08.546
Oh!

30:09.046 --> 30:10.088
Okay.

30:10.296 --> 30:12.713
You ran right into me!
Do you know how to drive?

30:12.796 --> 30:13.755
Not really.

30:14.588 --> 30:17.546
Oh, my God! My mom's gonna kill me!

30:17.630 --> 30:20.713
Okay, don't worry about it. I'll just
get the insurance. It'll be fine.

30:21.380 --> 30:22.380
I'm sorry, I...

30:22.921 --> 30:24.255
-Ugh.
- That's crazy.

30:28.005 --> 30:30.255
<i>♪ Oogum oogum boogum boogum ♪</i>

30:30.338 --> 30:33.005

No, I'm fine. I-I don't...

30:39.671 --> 30:42.046
really have much of an appetite
right now. So...

30:44.171 --> 30:46.546
It must've been embarrassing for you
back there, huh?

30:46.630 --> 30:47.463
It's fine.

30:48.338 --> 30:50.088
They all think I'm a weirdo anyway.

30:50.880 --> 30:51.713
Why?

30:53.338 --> 30:55.963
'Cause I live in a retirement community.

30:56.296 --> 30:59.380
Yeah, I mean, why do you live here?

31:01.296 --> 31:05.171
My parents weren't really
the parenting... types.

31:07.005 --> 31:09.713
-Can I ask you something?
-Yeah, shoot. Yeah.

31:09.963 --> 31:12.338
Why did you move to Sun Springs?

31:13.213 --> 31:15.296
I don't know.
I guess I just wanted to get away.

31:15.380 --> 31:17.255
I wanted to simplify my life.

31:17.671 --> 31:18.671
Is it working?

31:19.130 --> 31:20.005
Not really.

31:21.088 --> 31:23.005
-Right.

31:27.255 --> 31:28.713
Oh, God, you know what?

31:29.546 --> 31:31.880
We're still one woman short.

31:31.963 --> 31:34.630
Well, it's probably for the best.

31:35.255 --> 31:37.255
I mean, I love those gals...

31:37.338 --> 31:38.921
-Uh-huh.
-But, oh, let's face it!

31:39.005 --> 31:40.296
They're not really cheerleaders.

31:40.380 --> 31:42.838
You know, you're supposed to be
helping me, right?

31:43.213 --> 31:47.463
Remember, six women
signed up for the try-outs, but--

31:47.546 --> 31:48.921
Only five showed up.

31:51.005 --> 31:52.880
So, who's the sixth?

31:56.296 --> 31:58.588
Nice place you got here.
It's very...

31:59.046 --> 31:59.880
themed.

31:59.963 --> 32:00.880
Oh, yes.

32:00.963 --> 32:03.671
My husband, he enjoys the game.

32:04.088 --> 32:05.796
Oh, do you play golf, by the way?

32:05.880 --> 32:07.088
-Oh, no!
- No?

32:07.171 --> 32:08.713
No.

32:10.713 --> 32:12.171
So, um, Alice,

32:12.255 --> 32:16.213
we notice you signed up
for the cheerleading try-outs.

32:16.296 --> 32:18.755
Oh, yes, I saw your flyer.

32:18.838 --> 32:19.796
It sounded fun.

32:19.880 --> 32:21.630
Oh, why didn't you come?

32:22.005 --> 32:23.921
Well, I wanted to.

32:24.005 --> 32:28.005
But my husband doesn't like me out
too much on my own.

32:28.546 --> 32:30.921
I took a sewing class last year,

32:31.005 --> 32:33.963
and he had to make his own dinners
on Wednesday nights.

32:34.505 --> 32:36.588
Well, that sounds traumatic, of course.

32:36.755 --> 32:39.255
What if we practiced in the morning,

32:39.338 --> 32:41.755
and then you could get home
in time for dinner?

32:41.838 --> 32:42.671
Yeah!

32:43.130 --> 32:44.713
Yeah, well, it's not just that.

32:44.796 --> 32:45.630
-No?
-No.

32:45.713 --> 32:48.213
-He's worried about the morality of it.
-The morality?

32:48.296 --> 32:51.921
Yes, he says that anyone who wants to be
a cheerleader at my age

32:52.171 --> 32:53.838
is either a slut or a whore.

32:53.921 --> 32:56.130
-And probably both.

32:56.213 --> 32:58.713
Maybe he should just take
his caveman-like opinions

32:58.796 --> 33:00.463
-and shove them up his you know what.
-Hey!

33:00.546 --> 33:03.921
-I mean-- Oh, sorry.
-Alice, we're just a bunch of nice ladies.

33:04.005 --> 33:07.380
-looking for some clean, wholesome fun.
-Okay, yes.

33:07.796 --> 33:09.046
What do ya say?

33:10.005 --> 33:13.005
Well, I always did
want to be a cheerleader.

33:14.630 --> 33:17.213
Maybe I could ask him one more time.

33:17.296 --> 33:18.130
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

33:18.213 --> 33:19.630
-Okay.
-Go on.

33:22.880 --> 33:23.713
Good luck.

33:23.796 --> 33:25.963
-"Good luck." Oh, my gosh.

33:28.630 --> 33:29.713
She's a sweetheart.

33:29.796 --> 33:31.630
She's very sweet.

33:31.713 --> 33:32.838
Very sweet.

33:33.255 --> 33:35.671
God, he really loves golf.

33:36.130 --> 33:39.546
- He sounds like such an asshole.
- Okay, here she comes.

33:43.630 --> 33:45.046
So...

33:46.505 --> 33:48.088
-Did you ask him?
-I did.

33:48.796 --> 33:50.546
And? What'd he say?

33:50.630 --> 33:52.296
"Over my dead body!"

33:59.671 --> 34:02.463
Oh, God.
That was fast, wasn't it?

34:02.921 --> 34:04.880
A little too fast, if you ask me.

34:04.963 --> 34:06.838
No, he confused his meds.

34:06.921 --> 34:09.713
I'm sure Alice didn't want to kill him.

34:10.255 --> 34:12.380
Well, she always
wanted to be a cheerleader.

34:12.463 --> 34:14.380
Oh, come on. The woman is devastated.

34:14.463 --> 34:17.170
I'm sure it was the last thing
that was on her mind.

34:19.545 --> 34:21.005
See you at practice.

34:27.420 --> 34:28.463
Hello, everyone!

34:28.545 --> 34:29.380
Hi!

34:29.463 --> 34:30.630
-Good morning.
-Hi.

34:30.713 --> 34:32.545
- Morning.
-Wow, look at you all.

34:32.630 --> 34:35.795
I think we should try
something very simple to begin.

34:36.295 --> 34:38.420
So, if you don't mind,
I would really enjoy

34:38.505 --> 34:40.295
seeing you getting into a straight line.

34:41.420 --> 34:43.920
We're gonna try
some very simple positions.

34:44.005 --> 34:44.963
Now, watch me.

34:45.045 --> 34:46.420
So, it's on the count of three.

34:46.505 --> 34:48.963
It's one, two, three, boom!

34:49.795 --> 34:51.213
You got that? Straight arms!

34:51.295 --> 34:53.755
One, two, three, boom!

34:53.838 --> 34:54.670
Jump!

34:57.005 --> 34:57.921
Not quite good.

34:58.005 --> 34:59.838
-What-- what's the matter?

34:59.921 --> 35:00.755
I'm sorry.

35:00.838 --> 35:03.296
- I have a sore shoulder.
-You can't bend it?

35:03.380 --> 35:05.255
I had to take an aspirin...

35:05.338 --> 35:06.713
-Oh!
-Oh, honey!

35:06.796 --> 35:08.171
Can I put this down? I have--

35:08.255 --> 35:09.838
Yeah. Okay, that's fine. Good.

35:09.921 --> 35:11.880
-I have to be careful!
- Hm?

35:12.088 --> 35:14.005
I had my knee replaced last year.

35:14.088 --> 35:17.046
Well, that's-- No, that's perfectly fine.
You can just bend at your hips.

35:17.130 --> 35:19.213
I can't jump too much 'cause I get dizzy.

35:19.630 --> 35:21.088
When I jump too much, I get dizzy.

35:21.171 --> 35:22.171
-You do?
-Yeah.

35:22.255 --> 35:26.671
Martha, maybe we should make a list
of everybody's conditions.

35:31.546 --> 35:32.713
We're not making a list.

35:33.171 --> 35:35.713
-You got my dizziness down, right?
-Yeah, got that.

35:35.796 --> 35:36.713
And sciatica.

35:36.796 --> 35:39.046
-I have the sciatica.
-Oh, right.

35:39.130 --> 35:40.213
- And my wrist.
-Oh!

35:40.296 --> 35:42.213
Did I mention I had chlamydia?

35:42.296 --> 35:45.213
Yeah, that and a shocking amount
of other personal information,

35:45.296 --> 35:47.505
so can we get back to rehearsing?

35:47.588 --> 35:49.088
But what about you, Martha?

35:49.171 --> 35:50.755
Do you have anything to report?

35:51.213 --> 35:52.921
No. I'm fine. I'm actually-- I'm--

35:53.005 --> 35:54.963
I'm just as fit as a fiddle.

36:08.838 --> 36:11.463
Uh, hi. Excuse me, are-- are you Martha?

36:11.546 --> 36:12.963
And you are who?

36:13.046 --> 36:15.505
I'm Tom Lendl. I'm Helen's son.

36:15.838 --> 36:17.046
Is everything all right?

36:17.130 --> 36:18.921
Well, no. Uh, it isn't.

36:19.005 --> 36:23.088
My mother said she needs $100
for some cheerleading club?

36:23.463 --> 36:25.338
Yeah, why is that any of your business?

36:25.421 --> 36:26.921
I handle my mother's finances.

36:27.255 --> 36:29.213
Well, if Helen has a problem,

36:29.296 --> 36:31.046
she can talk to me,
we'll work something out.

36:31.130 --> 36:33.671
-My mother doesn't need money. Okay?
-Okay.

36:33.755 --> 36:36.921
She's got plenty of money.
My father left her... quite a lot.

36:37.005 --> 36:38.921
It's up to me to make sure
she spends it wisely.

36:39.005 --> 36:39.921
Mmm.

36:40.005 --> 36:43.380
I'm sure you're aware of the fact
that your mother is an adult.

36:43.463 --> 36:45.130
Well, I don't know if you're aware,

36:45.213 --> 36:48.088
but this place is a cesspool...

36:48.171 --> 36:50.588
-...of con artists and salesmen.

36:50.755 --> 36:52.713
All trying to take advantage
of gullible old women.

36:52.796 --> 36:53.630
It's true!

36:54.005 --> 36:55.421
Thank you, Carl.

36:55.505 --> 36:57.380
I can handle this, okay?

37:00.005 --> 37:01.213
One hundred dollars.

37:02.005 --> 37:02.838
For what?

37:03.171 --> 37:04.921
Uniforms for the Senior Showcase.

37:05.005 --> 37:05.963
Uniforms?

37:06.213 --> 37:07.421
-Yeah!

37:07.713 --> 37:08.546
Funny?

37:09.213 --> 37:10.921
-You think that's funny?

37:11.255 --> 37:12.588
A little. Yes.

37:13.338 --> 37:15.171
Nobody wants to see
a bunch of 80-year-olds

37:15.255 --> 37:16.463
running around in short skirts.

37:16.546 --> 37:17.505
Uh-huh.

37:18.880 --> 37:19.755
It's not gonna happen.

37:23.463 --> 37:24.338
Let's go.

37:37.296 --> 37:38.838
<i>Martha, Vicki here.</i>

37:39.088 --> 37:41.255
<i>The committee regretfully denies</i>

37:41.338 --> 37:45.088
<i>your request for more time to rehearse</i>
<i>in the recreation center.</i>

37:45.338 --> 37:47.338
<i>Now, I'm sure you understand.</i>

37:47.588 --> 37:51.255
<i>We have to prioritize</i>
<i>the more established clubs</i>

37:51.338 --> 37:54.380
<i>-in the lead-up to the Senior Showcase.</i>

38:00.838 --> 38:04.380
So, what's the first thing you're gonna do
when you get your driver's license?

38:05.421 --> 38:07.671
-Got any hot dates planned?

38:09.088 --> 38:10.671
I don't even have a car.

38:10.755 --> 38:13.796
Yeah, so? I mean, get a job and buy one.

38:13.880 --> 38:15.130
-I have a job.
- Oh?

38:15.213 --> 38:17.796
But most of my money goes to Sheryl
to help out with the rent.

38:17.880 --> 38:19.255
I work at this pizza place.

38:19.671 --> 38:21.338
So, hang on.
Why don't you come work for us?

38:21.421 --> 38:23.921
Because we need music in our rehearsals...

38:24.005 --> 38:26.046
-...and you'd be a great DJ.

38:26.838 --> 38:27.921
No, thank you.

38:28.005 --> 38:30.296
- Yes!
-I think it's embarrassing enough already.

38:30.380 --> 38:33.046
No, come on.
How about 40 bucks a rehearsal?

38:36.088 --> 38:36.921
Huh?

38:41.630 --> 38:43.338
I've gotta show you
something, here.

38:43.713 --> 38:44.630
Mmm...

38:45.046 --> 38:46.005
Look at this!

38:47.380 --> 38:49.296
Look at this, we got pom-poms!

38:49.796 --> 38:51.880
Great! Fantastic!

38:55.546 --> 38:57.630
Oh, my goodness!

38:58.088 --> 39:01.005
All right, everybody?
Okay, you ready?

39:01.088 --> 39:01.921
Okay, here I go.

39:02.255 --> 39:05.588
Now, five, six, seven, eight.

39:05.671 --> 39:06.963
Jump one, hold two.

39:07.046 --> 39:08.588
Arms three, hold four.

39:08.671 --> 39:10.338
Hips five, six.

39:10.421 --> 39:12.213
Clap seven, punch eight!

39:12.296 --> 39:14.963
Got it? Should we do it again?
Want me to do it one more time for you?

39:15.046 --> 39:16.213
-Yeah, yeah.
-Okay.

39:16.296 --> 39:17.421
-This is crazy.
-Ready, and...

39:17.755 --> 39:19.421
Jump one!

39:19.505 --> 39:21.255
Hold two, arms three.

39:21.338 --> 39:22.713
Hold four.

39:22.796 --> 39:25.130
Hips five, six.

39:25.463 --> 39:26.588
Clap seven.

39:26.671 --> 39:27.880
Punch eight!

39:27.963 --> 39:29.421
Do you think you have it? All right!

39:29.505 --> 39:31.630
Know what we're gonna do?
Put this baby to music.

39:31.713 --> 39:32.838
Ben, you got the music there?

39:32.921 --> 39:35.255
-I got it. Little old school but I got it.
-Yeah, yeah.

39:35.338 --> 39:37.880
Thanks for the opinion. And here we go.

39:37.963 --> 39:39.963
-Jump one.

39:40.296 --> 39:42.338
Hold two. Arms three.

39:42.421 --> 39:43.255
Hold four.

39:43.338 --> 39:45.380
Hips five, six.

39:45.463 --> 39:46.755
Clap seven.

39:46.921 --> 39:48.296

40:23.463 --> 40:25.880
Oh, no. We gotta take this from the top.

40:25.963 --> 40:27.213
- Yup.

40:27.296 --> 40:28.421
-Come on!
- All right?

40:28.880 --> 40:30.713
Now look, Alice, here's the problem here.

40:30.796 --> 40:32.838
I'm really sorry about this,
but you're too slow.

40:33.213 --> 40:34.921
-You got--
-What bullshit!

40:35.005 --> 40:35.838
Whoa.

40:36.255 --> 40:37.088
Oh.

40:38.463 --> 40:39.588
I'm sorry. Sorry.

40:40.088 --> 40:41.963
My husband didn't like it when I cursed,

40:42.046 --> 40:45.463
so now that he's gone,
I'm gonna give it a shot.

40:45.755 --> 40:49.921
Yeah, I'm also gonna try reefer cigarettes
and cunnilingus.

40:50.005 --> 40:51.671
- Yeah, there you go!
-Yes!

40:51.755 --> 40:53.755
Okay! Thanks for sharing.

40:53.838 --> 40:56.046
Okay, let's... let's go with this
one more time!

40:56.130 --> 40:58.046
Let's do it! You can do it!

40:58.755 --> 41:02.088
Cunnilingus! Go!

41:09.588 --> 41:10.713
-Bye, ladies.
-Hey!

41:10.796 --> 41:11.963
-See you later.
-See you later.

41:12.046 --> 41:14.338
The girls are gonna have a drink.
You wanna come?

41:14.421 --> 41:16.296
You know, quite frankly,

41:17.130 --> 41:19.880
we need more rehearsal time, not drinks,
because you know why?

41:19.963 --> 41:21.713
We look like a bunch of old ladies
out there.

41:21.796 --> 41:24.755
We are a bunch of old ladies
out there.

41:25.505 --> 41:27.421
And where are we gonna practice?

41:27.505 --> 41:31.546
I mean, Vicki will hardly let us
use this space as it is.

41:31.630 --> 41:33.713
No, but you need to get us a space
at the school.

41:33.796 --> 41:36.505
No, I can't do that.
I'm in big trouble at the school.

41:36.588 --> 41:39.921
I was caught handing out prophylactics
in the girls' bathroom.

41:40.005 --> 41:42.380
Mm-hmm. The Senior Showcase
is in two weeks

41:42.713 --> 41:45.380
and we need rehearsals.

41:45.463 --> 41:46.296
Okay.

41:46.921 --> 41:48.588
I'll ask the principal.

41:49.255 --> 41:50.838
He's got a crush on me. It could work.

41:51.171 --> 41:52.630
Well, all right. Okay.

41:53.713 --> 41:54.546
All right.

41:54.630 --> 41:56.380
And one.

41:56.880 --> 41:58.380
And two.

41:59.046 --> 42:02.338
And keep your form, ladies. With the curl.

42:02.421 --> 42:03.963
And three.

42:04.046 --> 42:05.713
And four.

42:05.796 --> 42:07.046
Come on, keep that form!

42:07.130 --> 42:09.171
It's all about that bone density!

42:09.255 --> 42:10.838
Welcome to the gun show, Helen.

42:10.921 --> 42:13.380
There you go. Ooh, look at those guns!

42:13.463 --> 42:14.588
-Look at that!
-I love it.

42:14.671 --> 42:15.671
All right, girl.

42:15.755 --> 42:18.005
Okay, now, chest presses. And one.

42:18.546 --> 42:19.755
And two.

42:19.838 --> 42:21.755
-Ladies.
-And three.

42:21.838 --> 42:24.255
- Gettin' ready for the showcase?
- And four.

42:24.338 --> 42:25.338
Yes, indeed, Miss Vicki.

42:25.421 --> 42:30.005
I'm sorry that we had to cancel
your rehearsal tomorrow.

42:30.338 --> 42:33.796
I realize that you have got
a lot of training to get done.

42:34.130 --> 42:35.838
Well, don't you worry about it,

42:35.921 --> 42:39.630
because Sheryl's already found us
a better place to rehearse.

42:39.880 --> 42:41.296
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, really?

42:42.421 --> 42:43.713
Where might that be?

42:45.588 --> 42:47.630
Come on. This way, ladies.

42:47.880 --> 42:49.005
What are we doing here?

42:49.713 --> 42:55.171
Oh, so this is what it's like
being a cheerleader.

42:55.421 --> 42:56.421
Oh.

42:56.505 --> 42:59.088
I feel like pushing someone into a locker.

42:59.171 --> 43:00.630
- Oh, cougar alert!

43:00.713 --> 43:01.588
Guys, guys.

43:03.005 --> 43:04.505
You gotta listen to me for a second.

43:05.046 --> 43:06.338
-You can't do this.
- Huh?

43:06.421 --> 43:09.130
Okay? This is a bad, bad idea.

43:09.421 --> 43:12.421
-Oh, don't be so dramatic.
-Grandma...

43:12.505 --> 43:15.171
You are going to humiliate yourself

43:15.255 --> 43:16.796
in front of the entire school!

43:16.880 --> 43:18.088
The entire school?

43:18.171 --> 43:20.213
The entire school,
what're we talking about here, huh?

43:20.921 --> 43:22.255
-Huh?
-You don't know?

43:22.630 --> 43:23.505
No!

43:24.588 --> 43:26.046
This is what you wanted.

43:26.130 --> 43:27.963
No, this is not what I wanted.

43:28.213 --> 43:29.880
I wanted a space to rehearse in.

43:30.130 --> 43:31.755
-That's what this is.
-No, this...

43:32.130 --> 43:33.463
This is a pep rally.

43:33.546 --> 43:34.671
-Yeah.
-Right?

43:34.755 --> 43:38.505
There's a whole school out there,
and we're not ready for an audience, okay?

43:38.588 --> 43:40.130
We can't cancel!

43:40.338 --> 43:43.796
You have no idea what I had to go through
with the principal

43:43.880 --> 43:45.338
just to make this happen!

43:45.421 --> 43:46.713
Well, well, well!

43:46.796 --> 43:49.255
-Oh!
-If it isn't the teacher of the year!

43:49.671 --> 43:52.755
Isn't there a quarterback somewhere
you need to be giving a handjob?

43:52.838 --> 43:53.880
Okay, just...

43:53.963 --> 43:57.963
All right, do you mind just
stepping outside for a moment, please?

43:58.213 --> 43:59.380
What? No!

43:59.838 --> 44:03.380
This is our pep rally! They already
made us cut a minute off our routine.

44:03.463 --> 44:06.338
Okay, but just give us a second, okay?

44:07.421 --> 44:08.880
-Whatever.
-Whatever.

44:08.963 --> 44:12.546
I just hope your moves
are a little more up-to-date than you are.

44:12.630 --> 44:14.380
You bitches wanna rumble?

44:14.463 --> 44:15.713
Oh, weird.

44:16.421 --> 44:17.255
Yeah.

44:17.838 --> 44:18.755
See ya out there.

44:35.421 --> 44:36.880
Son of a whore.

44:38.838 --> 44:39.963
Look how young they are!

44:40.421 --> 44:42.046
Oh, good booties.

44:42.588 --> 44:44.713
-And they're really good.
-Mm-hmm.

44:44.796 --> 44:46.838
Ah, they're not that good.

44:46.921 --> 44:48.005
You're blind.

Oh! Oh, God! I hurt my ankle!

46:39.380 --> 46:42.463
-Oh!
-She's not okay. She's not okay.

46:42.546 --> 46:45.171
- That's all right. It's okay.

46:47.171 --> 46:49.088
-Get the medic.
-Get some ice, right now.

46:49.880 --> 46:52.338
Oh! Ooh!

46:54.088 --> 46:55.921
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine!

46:56.005 --> 46:57.630
Everyone's making a fuss.

46:57.713 --> 46:59.505
-Are you sure?
- Yes.

46:59.588 --> 47:03.796
I told you we weren't ready. We made
complete fools of ourselves out there.

47:08.630 --> 47:11.046
-Oh, shit!
-What?

47:11.130 --> 47:12.588
-What?
-What?

47:12.671 --> 47:13.546
What now?

47:17.130 --> 47:18.796
- That's us!
- Oh, no!

47:18.880 --> 47:22.213
- Could I see?
-It already has 20,000 views.

47:22.296 --> 47:24.338
- Oh!
-Well, you gotta take it down.

47:24.421 --> 47:26.421
-I can't take it off.
-There has to be a way, right?

47:26.505 --> 47:28.463
-I mean, some technical--
-No, it's there.

47:28.546 --> 47:30.505
"Old cheerleaders fail."

47:31.005 --> 47:31.838
Oh.

47:33.963 --> 47:34.796
Okay.

47:35.130 --> 47:36.588
- Can I see?

47:37.463 --> 47:38.588
What? What's going on?

47:41.171 --> 47:42.588
Wait, you posted it?

47:42.671 --> 47:43.505
Yeah.

47:43.588 --> 47:44.963
Why would you do that?

47:45.046 --> 47:46.713
Because it's hilarious.

47:46.796 --> 47:48.755
This is totally going viral.

47:49.838 --> 47:50.671
Wow.

47:52.588 --> 47:53.421
What?

47:55.755 --> 47:56.588
What?

47:56.963 --> 47:58.713
I blame myself.

47:59.380 --> 48:02.713
I mean, this is just the sort of thing
that I knew would happen.

48:03.171 --> 48:07.963
Not only has one of our residents
suffered a serious injury,

48:08.255 --> 48:12.130
but now her son is threatening a lawsuit.

48:13.005 --> 48:16.130
Is there anything
that you ladies care to say?

48:16.213 --> 48:17.088
No.

48:19.546 --> 48:21.505
Then let's put it to a vote.

48:21.880 --> 48:24.255
All of those in favor of the ban.

48:26.463 --> 48:27.588
- Mm-hmm.
- Yes.

48:28.421 --> 48:29.713
- Yes for me.
- Yeah.

48:29.796 --> 48:30.838
Mm-hmm.

48:41.255 --> 48:42.505
It's unanimous.

48:43.588 --> 48:46.546
You are hereby ordered
to cease all club activities.

48:47.630 --> 48:48.463
Thank you.

48:49.671 --> 48:51.963
Well, what did she expect
going out like that?

48:52.505 --> 48:53.505
Where are you going?

48:53.796 --> 48:54.755
Home.

49:08.796 --> 49:10.671
Hold on, hold on! There's more!

49:10.755 --> 49:12.380
You think they're talkin' about us?

49:15.880 --> 49:16.880
I don't know.

49:20.421 --> 49:21.880
Not today, Satan.

49:22.838 --> 49:25.880
<i>Local residents</i>

49:36.963 --> 49:37.796
Hey, Mom.

49:41.921 --> 49:43.713
It's time for you to get some rest.

49:44.088 --> 49:45.338
I am resting.

49:45.421 --> 49:47.630
Mother, Susan and I
are gonna be staying here for a while.

49:47.963 --> 49:49.755
No, that won't be necessary.

49:49.838 --> 49:51.755
Yes, I think it is necessary.

50:04.755 --> 50:06.005
What's wrong with you lately?

50:07.838 --> 50:10.088
I just miss cheerleading.

50:15.546 --> 50:19.713
Please give a round of applause
to the Calibray Club!

50:21.546 --> 50:25.171
Oh, and our next act, the sunscreen,

50:25.255 --> 50:27.421
always got a full tan!

50:29.671 --> 50:31.005
- Hey.
- <i>Hi!</i>

50:31.088 --> 50:31.921
Are you around?

50:36.963 --> 50:37.796
So...

50:38.713 --> 50:40.005
you went to the Showcase?

50:40.380 --> 50:42.505
Well, I drove by. I didn't go inside. I--

50:42.588 --> 50:46.755
Oh, it's too bad.
We had a real shot at that trophy.

50:46.838 --> 50:48.296
Do you really think so?

50:48.963 --> 50:50.255
-Not really.

50:50.338 --> 50:52.380
I'm just trying to be supportive.

50:52.463 --> 50:53.546
Yeah, right.

50:53.630 --> 50:56.755
Listen, I am sorry about the pep rally.

50:56.838 --> 50:58.255
It was a dumb idea.

50:59.505 --> 51:01.671
No, it's not your fault.

51:03.130 --> 51:04.296
-It was.
-You know, I...

51:05.671 --> 51:07.130
I miss the girls, though.

51:08.046 --> 51:09.421
Yeah, me too.

51:10.671 --> 51:12.921
I've never had a lot of girlfriends.

51:13.171 --> 51:14.171
It's quite nice.

51:17.588 --> 51:18.421
Hmm?

51:18.796 --> 51:19.880
I miss you, too.

51:20.296 --> 51:21.421
I miss you!

51:21.505 --> 51:22.713
- Really?

51:23.588 --> 51:24.755
Oh, my goodness.

51:25.505 --> 51:27.296
-On the bright side...
-Uh-huh.

51:28.671 --> 51:31.796
We're up to half a million hits.
Look at this.

51:38.671 --> 51:42.713
I'd like to get my hands
on whoever posted that. Okay?

51:43.421 --> 51:44.463
<i>I can't...</i>

51:44.546 --> 51:45.505
Hey, wait a minute.

51:46.130 --> 51:47.046
-What do you mean?
-Shh.

51:47.130 --> 51:48.463
-Listen. Listen.
-Okay.

51:48.546 --> 51:49.380
Uh-huh.

51:50.088 --> 51:51.296
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

51:52.338 --> 51:53.171
The little...

51:53.921 --> 51:56.088
-That is Chloe's voice!
-It was.

51:56.171 --> 51:57.005
-It's Chloe!
-Yeah.

51:57.088 --> 51:59.296
That's right.
The cheerleader did this, okay?

52:01.213 --> 52:02.046
Yeah.

52:02.546 --> 52:03.755
Uh-huh.

52:06.380 --> 52:07.255
Oh.

52:08.671 --> 52:11.130
-Shit.
-Are you sure this is a good idea?

52:11.213 --> 52:14.213
Yes, we're gonna talk to her parents,
and I'm sure they're going to understand.

52:14.296 --> 52:16.130
I don't think her parents are home.

52:17.338 --> 52:18.421
-Oh.

52:21.921 --> 52:22.921
Uh...

52:29.921 --> 52:32.546
This is all...
What a nightmare! Ugh!

52:32.630 --> 52:35.171
Is this what a teenage party is all about?

52:35.963 --> 52:37.213
Oh, hey. Look.

52:37.921 --> 52:38.880
Hey, Chloe.

52:38.963 --> 52:40.088
Oh, shit!

52:40.713 --> 52:42.296
Did you think that was funny?

52:42.713 --> 52:46.713
Did you and your friends have a big laugh
at all the old ladies?

52:47.130 --> 52:50.755
I guess it wasn't enough just
to humiliate us in front of the school.

52:50.838 --> 52:52.755
You had to share it with the whole world.

52:52.838 --> 52:56.796
Isn't it enough to be pretty, and smart,

52:56.880 --> 52:58.213
and popular?

52:58.296 --> 53:00.421
You have to knock
everybody else down, too?

53:00.796 --> 53:02.421
I mean, what, wait a minute now.

53:03.046 --> 53:05.671
No clever retort, huh?
You have nothing to say at all?

53:07.338 --> 53:08.255
Oh.

53:08.546 --> 53:09.671
-Oh, dear.
-Oh, dear.

53:09.755 --> 53:10.921
-Oh.

53:11.713 --> 53:12.546
Okay...

53:12.630 --> 53:13.880
-No, it's all--
-Hey, hey.

53:14.088 --> 53:15.796
It's all right. It's okay.

53:15.880 --> 53:17.755
There's nothing to cry about, okay?

53:17.838 --> 53:20.088
Don't worry. Don't... don't cry!

53:20.171 --> 53:22.046
No, I'm so sorry.

53:22.713 --> 53:25.505
I didn't know they were gonna post it.
I promise.

53:26.213 --> 53:28.255
God, you must hate me!

53:28.338 --> 53:30.213
Oh, we don't hate you.

53:31.130 --> 53:32.671
Actually, we need you.

53:35.338 --> 53:36.296
For what?

53:38.421 --> 53:40.046
Well, we want you to be our choreographer.

53:40.421 --> 53:42.380
- Yeah.
- That's right.

53:42.463 --> 53:45.130
We're putting our squad back together,

53:45.213 --> 53:47.630
and as you may have noticed,
we have a few rough edges,

53:47.713 --> 53:49.338
but we've seen you. We have.

53:49.880 --> 53:50.713
You're good.

53:50.796 --> 53:52.421
-Yeah.
-And we need some of that.

53:52.505 --> 53:55.463
But...  with school
and cheering, I...

53:56.380 --> 53:57.880
I just don't have the time.

53:57.963 --> 54:00.463
-Oh.
-Oh, that's a shame.

54:00.546 --> 54:01.630
Isn't it, Martha?

54:02.380 --> 54:04.213
Oh, yeah. Yeah, that's a real shame.

54:06.296 --> 54:09.005
Oh, but you know
what would be a real shame?

54:09.088 --> 54:10.171
What's that?

54:11.630 --> 54:15.255
If Chloe's parents found out
about this totally epic party.

54:15.713 --> 54:17.713
Oh, that'd be a terrible shame.

54:18.130 --> 54:19.213
You wouldn't.

54:19.671 --> 54:21.130
We might.

54:21.838 --> 54:22.713
Try us.

54:25.630 --> 54:26.588
God.

54:28.505 --> 54:30.046
Good morning, ladies.

54:32.338 --> 54:33.671
What is she doing here?

54:34.046 --> 54:35.880
This is Chloe, right?

54:36.255 --> 54:39.505
Chloe has something
that she wants to say to everyone.

54:43.005 --> 54:44.880
I was the one who took the video.

54:44.963 --> 54:46.463
-Oh, boy.
-Oh, come on. Jeez.

54:46.546 --> 54:48.921
Look, I-I never meant
for it to be posted online,

54:49.005 --> 54:50.296
and  I'm sorry.

54:50.755 --> 54:53.796
-I'm really sorry.
-Glad you got that off your chest.

54:53.880 --> 54:57.130
I'm sorry, but there's more
that Chloe has to say. Go on, Chloe.

54:57.380 --> 54:58.213
Uh...

54:59.213 --> 55:03.171
And I would really love
to help coach you guys.

55:04.296 --> 55:06.296
Why would we let her coach us?

55:06.380 --> 55:08.463
Because, Olive,
in case you haven't noticed,

55:08.546 --> 55:10.130
we could do with a little help.

55:10.213 --> 55:12.338
We're not even a club anymore.

55:12.421 --> 55:15.046
-Vicki banned us.
-Oh, forget Vicki!

55:15.380 --> 55:18.171
-We will practice in secret.
-Practice for what?

55:18.255 --> 55:19.546
The Showcase is over.

55:19.630 --> 55:22.505
We're gonna find someplace else
to perform, okay?

55:22.588 --> 55:24.796
We humiliated ourselves. Everybody saw it.

55:24.880 --> 55:27.130
And that's the reason
why we need to do this.

55:27.213 --> 55:28.296
To prove we're not some joke

55:28.380 --> 55:30.421
and to show the world
what we can really do!

55:31.463 --> 55:32.755
We really can do this

55:32.838 --> 55:35.255
if we do this together.

55:35.963 --> 55:36.796
Huh?

55:38.338 --> 55:45.046
All right, ladies. I want you to look
at your reflection in the mirror, okay?

55:45.130 --> 55:46.255
What are we doing?

55:46.796 --> 55:49.130
Just look at your reflection, Ruby.

55:49.213 --> 55:53.171
I want you to really, really look
in that mirror,

55:54.755 --> 55:56.713
and take in yourselves, right?

55:56.796 --> 55:57.838
Look closely.

55:58.546 --> 56:01.380
We're all so self-conscious,

56:01.463 --> 56:04.088
and we're all so worried

56:04.171 --> 56:06.755
about what everyone else is thinking,

56:06.838 --> 56:09.546
when, of course, the only thing
that really matters

56:09.880 --> 56:12.255
is what we think of ourselves.

56:12.630 --> 56:15.963
Really, I want you to take yourself in.

56:16.213 --> 56:18.088
Now, on the count of three,

56:18.713 --> 56:22.130
I want you to say one thing

56:22.505 --> 56:24.130
you like about yourselves.

56:24.213 --> 56:25.380
Oh, gosh.

56:26.046 --> 56:28.130
You can't be serious.

56:28.213 --> 56:29.130
My tits!

56:29.213 --> 56:31.130
-Uh, not yet. Not yet.

56:31.213 --> 56:33.046
Let's wait until the count of three.

56:33.546 --> 56:35.171
What if you don't like anything?

56:36.005 --> 56:38.546
Well, what do you mean?
Then you're not looking hard enough.

56:38.630 --> 56:41.755
You just have to find
what's great about yourselves, okay?

56:43.130 --> 56:44.755
All right. Ready?

56:46.505 --> 56:47.421
Look.

56:52.130 --> 56:53.130
Now...

56:53.505 --> 56:54.463
one,

56:54.796 --> 56:56.463
two, three!

57:03.713 --> 57:04.755
My hair.

57:04.838 --> 57:05.880
-Oh!

57:05.963 --> 57:07.255
So beautiful.

57:07.338 --> 57:08.380
Thank you.

57:08.463 --> 57:09.296
And?

57:09.380 --> 57:10.838
My hands.

57:11.255 --> 57:12.463
My hands.

57:12.546 --> 57:13.421
My smile.

57:14.546 --> 57:16.921
Look at that smile. Okay.

57:17.171 --> 57:18.921
-Damn it.
-And no...

57:19.005 --> 57:19.963
Okay, my wrist.

57:21.463 --> 57:23.546
-Okay.

57:24.088 --> 57:25.588
They take blood really good.

57:25.921 --> 57:28.213
-I found another good feature of yours.

57:28.296 --> 57:29.130
Well...

57:29.630 --> 57:32.755
But what about me? What's good about me?
There's not one thing.

57:32.838 --> 57:34.213
Oh, stop!

57:35.963 --> 57:38.755
All right, let's work! Let's go!
Come on, Chloe!

57:41.505 --> 57:42.380
-Oh.
- Hm?

57:42.463 --> 57:43.755
-A competition?
- Mm-hmm.

57:43.838 --> 57:45.588
This is a really big deal.

57:45.671 --> 57:47.630
People come from all over to compete.

57:47.713 --> 57:50.088
You guys can't compete
next to real cheerleaders.

57:50.171 --> 57:53.380
-Yes, we can!
-The oldest category is 18 plus!

57:53.463 --> 57:56.213
- Uh-huh.
-So what? We're 18 plus.

57:56.296 --> 57:57.921
- Yeah.
-Eighteen plus 50.

57:58.005 --> 57:58.838
Yeah.

57:58.921 --> 58:00.338
-Oh, look.
- What?

58:00.421 --> 58:02.088
It's on in three weeks.

58:02.171 --> 58:04.421
Well, that's okay, because
Chloe's gonna help us.

58:04.505 --> 58:05.380
-Right, Chloe?
-No!

58:05.463 --> 58:08.255
No, you guys didn't say anything
about a competition!

58:08.505 --> 58:10.296
Do you know how much training
that involves?

58:10.380 --> 58:13.421
People train for a year, not three weeks!

58:14.588 --> 58:15.421
Okay...

58:16.671 --> 58:18.088
What do you think?

58:19.796 --> 58:21.880
I say screw it. Let's sign up.

58:22.963 --> 58:24.130
-Oh, my God.
-Yes.

58:24.546 --> 58:26.171
-Come on.
-Yes!

58:26.421 --> 58:29.671
Let's just start with our feet
a little wider than shoulder width,

58:29.755 --> 58:30.588
like so.

58:30.921 --> 58:33.588
And we're just gonna start
with some really easy movement.

58:33.671 --> 58:35.588
So, bring your left arm like this.

58:36.130 --> 58:37.838
Left. Good!

58:38.380 --> 58:39.755
Down, right.

58:40.005 --> 58:41.630
And back up, left.

58:41.713 --> 58:43.088
Right, left!

58:43.421 --> 58:44.588
Left, right!

58:45.046 --> 58:46.380
Left and dirty!

58:46.463 --> 58:47.713
Yes, sexy!

58:47.796 --> 58:48.755

59:03.546 --> 59:05.046
Did you try to hit me?

59:05.130 --> 59:07.671
-You make mash-ups, right?
-Yeah, yeah, I can.

59:07.755 --> 59:09.880
Could you maybe
cut something together for us?

59:09.963 --> 59:10.838
Yeah, for sure.

59:10.921 --> 59:12.755
Oh, yes! Thank you so much!

59:42.005 --> 59:42.880
Oh?

59:42.963 --> 59:45.421
I always wanted to date a cheerleader.

Five, six, seven, eight...

01:00:14.213 --> 01:00:15.921
What's going on with you?
Where've you been?

01:00:16.005 --> 01:00:19.338
Sorry, it's been really crazy. So, I...

01:00:19.421 --> 01:00:21.046
Well, get your shit together.

01:00:21.130 --> 01:00:23.755
You miss one more practice
and we're voting you off the squad.

01:00:26.130 --> 01:00:27.546
-Are you okay?
-No, I'm fine.

01:00:27.630 --> 01:00:28.880
You look like shit.

01:00:28.963 --> 01:00:31.171
Thank you. No, I haven't been
sleeping well. I'm fine.

01:00:31.255 --> 01:00:34.088
-You're so skinny.
-Uh-huh. Let's get started, okay?

01:00:34.588 --> 01:00:35.588
Is that new?

01:00:35.880 --> 01:00:37.546
Thought we could use
a little bit more bass.

01:00:37.630 --> 01:00:40.546

haven't you?

Do you think you're irreplaceable?

01:01:12.380 --> 01:01:14.921
Well, I like to think I bring
a certain dignity to the position.

01:01:15.005 --> 01:01:17.963
Do you think that I would hesitate
to take your little badge,

01:01:18.046 --> 01:01:20.755
and take your little cards,
and give 'em to Dorris?

01:01:20.838 --> 01:01:23.546
Dorris is a trainee.
She doesn't have the experience.

01:01:23.630 --> 01:01:26.005
They are up to something! I know it!

01:01:26.338 --> 01:01:29.171
And either you are too stupid
to find it out,

01:01:29.255 --> 01:01:31.046
-or you're just not even trying!
-Mm-hmm.

01:01:31.130 --> 01:01:32.296
Well, I am definitely trying.

01:01:32.380 --> 01:01:36.463
Well, then find out what they're plannin'
and shut it down!

01:01:36.796 --> 01:01:38.671
Or I'll shut you down!

01:01:40.880 --> 01:01:42.338
- Yeah!

01:01:45.296 --> 01:01:46.171
Backstabber!

01:01:46.630 --> 01:01:49.296
So, Chloe,
I've been working on an idea.

01:01:49.380 --> 01:01:52.546
Something that, I don't know,
would make us stand out.

01:01:52.630 --> 01:01:53.463
You know?

01:01:53.546 --> 01:01:55.546
Trust me, you guys are gonna stand out.

01:01:56.005 --> 01:01:58.505
Yeah, but I do want you to bear with me.
All right?

01:01:59.088 --> 01:02:00.130
-You can do it.
-Okay.

01:02:00.463 --> 01:02:01.380
Okay, I'm down.

01:02:01.463 --> 01:02:02.588
-Okay.
-Show us then.

01:02:02.671 --> 01:02:04.088
-All right.
-I'm excited to see it.

01:02:04.338 --> 01:02:05.421
Mmm.

01:02:05.505 --> 01:02:07.421
Oh, here we are! Okay.

01:02:07.921 --> 01:02:09.671
Are you ready for the new move? All right.

01:02:09.755 --> 01:02:10.963
-New move?
-Yes?

01:02:11.171 --> 01:02:12.296
Oh, I didn't tell you?

01:02:17.005 --> 01:02:18.796
-Oh.
-Right? What do you think?

01:02:18.880 --> 01:02:20.380
-Wanna try it or not?
- Yeah.

01:02:20.463 --> 01:02:21.338
I knew you would!

01:02:21.588 --> 01:02:23.130
-I wanna see it.
-I'm not surprised.

01:02:25.921 --> 01:02:27.796
That's nice!
There was something about--

01:02:27.880 --> 01:02:29.838
Maybe we should have
those elbows stick out wider.

01:02:29.921 --> 01:02:31.838
And...

01:02:31.921 --> 01:02:34.255
Walk, walk, walk!

01:02:34.338 --> 01:02:36.796
Nod, nod, nod, nod!

01:02:37.088 --> 01:02:38.171
It's sexual.

01:02:39.963 --> 01:02:42.338
Walk, walk, walk, walk!

01:02:42.421 --> 01:02:43.255
Whoo!

01:02:43.630 --> 01:02:44.546
Unh, unh.

01:02:44.880 --> 01:02:46.088
Now, that was fantastic!

01:02:46.171 --> 01:02:47.755
This is good, right?

01:02:47.838 --> 01:02:48.796
Oh, you're strong.

01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:50.005
That's it, let's do it.

01:02:50.088 --> 01:02:52.380
Walk, walk, nod, nod.

01:02:52.588 --> 01:02:54.255
It's hard this time.

01:02:54.338 --> 01:02:55.671
No, we got it, we got it.

01:02:55.755 --> 01:02:57.838
We're gonna be fine. Okay? Ready, and...

01:02:57.921 --> 01:02:59.588
Walk, walk, walk.

01:02:59.671 --> 01:03:02.046
Unh, unh, unh, unh.

01:03:02.421 --> 01:03:04.755
Okay, um, let's do it one more time.

01:03:05.671 --> 01:03:07.796
-Excuse me, can you take over, Chloe?
-Yeah. Of course.

01:03:07.880 --> 01:03:09.546
Okay, that's good.  Oh, my God.

01:03:10.088 --> 01:03:12.046
Oh, yeah. I like this move.

01:03:12.130 --> 01:03:14.380
Let's get it. Left foot forward.

01:03:51.505 --> 01:03:52.838
Okay, ladies.

01:03:52.921 --> 01:03:54.338
Let's breathe in.

01:03:54.421 --> 01:03:56.630
Plié and bring your arms up!

01:03:57.171 --> 01:03:59.796
And exhale and go all the way down.

01:03:59.880 --> 01:04:01.880
Ow!

01:04:01.963 --> 01:04:03.838
Let's hang here for a minute.

01:04:04.463 --> 01:04:07.088
And slowly roll up.

01:04:08.130 --> 01:04:10.630
Feel your spine.

01:04:10.713 --> 01:04:11.713
Yeah.

01:04:11.796 --> 01:04:14.130
- Roll your shoulders back.

01:04:14.213 --> 01:04:15.921
-Nice.
- Excuse me.

01:04:16.005 --> 01:04:18.338
-Can I get a word, please?
-Where's Helen?

01:04:18.838 --> 01:04:20.255
I'm taking her out of this club.

01:04:20.338 --> 01:04:22.171
It's obvious she can't handle
the peer pressure.

01:04:22.255 --> 01:04:24.588
What are you talking about, peer pressure?
That's absurd.

01:04:24.671 --> 01:04:27.213
-Look at me when you talk to me.
-Not only do you break her ankle,

01:04:27.296 --> 01:04:29.505
now you wanna publicly humiliate her again

01:04:29.921 --> 01:04:31.338
with this stupid dance competition.

01:04:31.421 --> 01:04:33.255
No, Helen is a really big part
of this team.

01:04:33.338 --> 01:04:35.171
You can't just
take her out of the competition.

01:04:35.255 --> 01:04:38.630
Step back and let the adults talk. I don't
need a little slut telling me what to do.

01:04:38.713 --> 01:04:39.796
-What?

01:04:39.880 --> 01:04:41.588
What did you just call her?

01:04:42.796 --> 01:04:44.546
-Oh. Now that was...
-No, seriously.

01:04:44.796 --> 01:04:46.796
-That...
-What did you just call her?

01:04:46.880 --> 01:04:49.005
-That was out of line, I apologize.
-Say it again!

01:04:49.088 --> 01:04:51.963
-I dare you! What did you call her?
-Please get your hand-- Ma'am, get--

01:04:52.046 --> 01:04:53.505
Ma'am, get your hand out of my face.

01:04:53.588 --> 01:04:55.046
-Don't tell me what to do!
-Okay.

01:04:55.588 --> 01:04:56.421
I...

01:04:56.505 --> 01:04:57.671
Okay, I'm-- I'm leaving.

01:04:58.005 --> 01:04:59.505

01:05:48.171 --> 01:05:49.171
That feels good.

01:05:49.255 --> 01:05:50.671
- Wow.
- Wow!

01:05:50.755 --> 01:05:52.213
Just a little Sprite.

01:05:52.921 --> 01:05:57.796
Um, excuse me for a minute,
but I left a little something on lane 20.

01:05:57.880 --> 01:06:00.338
-Ooh!
-Oh!

01:06:00.421 --> 01:06:01.463
Is that a little something?

01:06:01.546 --> 01:06:02.880
-Wow.
-Careful, baby.

01:06:03.463 --> 01:06:05.713
He's kinda cute, don't you think?

01:06:05.796 --> 01:06:07.171

01:06:07.921 --> 01:06:09.546

01:06:09.630 --> 01:06:11.130
Whoo!

01:06:12.463 --> 01:06:16.088
Can you believe she's the same woman
who wasn't allowed to join the club?

01:06:16.171 --> 01:06:18.463
She should've killed that husband
years ago.

01:06:18.546 --> 01:06:20.588
Yeah!

01:06:20.671 --> 01:06:21.963
- Whoo!
- Joy!

01:06:22.046 --> 01:06:23.171
Kill the husband.

01:06:23.880 --> 01:06:24.838
Yes.

01:06:26.005 --> 01:06:26.838
Sheryl,

01:06:26.921 --> 01:06:30.005
that was so badass of you
to stick up for me back there.

01:06:30.088 --> 01:06:31.046
Oh.

01:06:31.463 --> 01:06:32.963
You're one of us now.

01:06:33.880 --> 01:06:35.838

01:06:37.171 --> 01:06:39.463

-Higher boobies!

01:06:41.338 --> 01:06:42.880
And she scores!

01:06:43.046 --> 01:06:44.630
Grab for the joy.

01:06:44.713 --> 01:06:47.421
It is so great to see you so happy.

01:06:47.921 --> 01:06:50.505
I think maybe more alcohol in my life
or something.

01:06:52.088 --> 01:06:53.463
Okay, we all love you!

01:06:53.546 --> 01:06:54.838
Yeah!

01:06:55.088 --> 01:06:56.255
We just love!

01:06:56.713 --> 01:06:58.088
Yeah!

01:07:03.671 --> 01:07:05.671
I'll be right back. I'll be right back.

01:07:08.421 --> 01:07:10.546
Okay, you want me
to come with you?

01:07:50.380 --> 01:07:51.546
Why didn't you tell me?

01:07:52.046 --> 01:07:52.963
Why would I?

01:07:54.046 --> 01:07:57.880
Because you tell your friends
when you got cancer, for Christ's sake.

01:07:58.713 --> 01:07:59.546
Yeah.

01:08:02.338 --> 01:08:03.171
Anyway...

01:08:04.921 --> 01:08:07.171
The doctor says you'll be out tomorrow.

01:08:07.255 --> 01:08:09.713
And once they drain away all the fluid,

01:08:09.796 --> 01:08:11.588
you'll be feeling fine, and...

01:08:11.671 --> 01:08:14.338
that's good because
the competition's in three days.

01:08:14.921 --> 01:08:15.755
I'm not going.

01:08:16.212 --> 01:08:18.505
Oh, yes, you are. The hell you're not.

01:08:18.587 --> 01:08:20.962
-No, you don't even need me! What am I--
-Yes, we--

01:08:21.046 --> 01:08:22.796
Of course we need you!

01:08:23.087 --> 01:08:24.255
You're the leader.

01:08:24.671 --> 01:08:27.712
And I'm not gonna let you quit
just like that.

01:08:27.796 --> 01:08:29.921
You are coming to the competition

01:08:30.337 --> 01:08:32.421
if I have to drag you there myself.

01:08:35.880 --> 01:08:36.755
I'm dying.

01:08:42.755 --> 01:08:43.587
Well...

01:08:45.546 --> 01:08:48.087
you were dying yesterday, and you're...

01:08:48.171 --> 01:08:50.421
you're gonna be dying next week.

01:08:51.921 --> 01:08:53.130
And in the meantime,

01:08:54.171 --> 01:08:56.130
you should be dancing your ass off.

01:08:57.671 --> 01:08:59.546
Isn't that what this was all about?

01:09:03.462 --> 01:09:04.546
I'm scared.

01:09:09.462 --> 01:09:11.712
-I'm scared, okay?
-I know, I know.

01:09:11.796 --> 01:09:13.962
I'm sorry, it's just--

01:09:14.046 --> 01:09:16.171
I know you're scared, of course.

01:09:16.837 --> 01:09:18.130
I'm so scared.

01:09:18.837 --> 01:09:21.712
Sometimes you just
have to look that shit in the face

01:09:21.796 --> 01:09:23.171
and tell it to go to hell.

01:09:27.712 --> 01:09:28.712
Thank you.

01:09:28.796 --> 01:09:30.296
-Okay.

01:09:31.921 --> 01:09:32.837
Thank you...

01:09:35.671 --> 01:09:37.130
for being my friend.

01:09:41.255 --> 01:09:43.087
-Your feet are cold.
-I know.

01:10:13.796 --> 01:10:15.838
-I don't think she's coming.
- Mm-mm.

01:10:15.921 --> 01:10:17.963
- Yeah, I don't know.
-We're gonna be late.

01:10:18.338 --> 01:10:19.546
Maybe we should just go on--

01:10:19.630 --> 01:10:22.546
No, Ruby! You sit your ass down.

01:10:22.796 --> 01:10:25.755
Nobody's going anywhere without Martha.

01:10:29.046 --> 01:10:29.880
It's okay.

01:10:30.880 --> 01:10:31.713
Oh!

01:10:32.713 --> 01:10:33.546
See?

01:10:33.880 --> 01:10:35.546
She's here! What took you so long?

01:10:35.630 --> 01:10:37.838
-Oh, I know. I know, I know.
-Girl, what took you so long?

01:10:37.921 --> 01:10:41.421
-Well, everybody's here.
-No, we got a stop to make.

01:10:42.463 --> 01:10:43.338
Okay?

01:10:43.921 --> 01:10:45.463
-We gotta get Helen.
- Hey, I--

01:10:46.005 --> 01:10:48.088
I can't do this.

01:10:48.171 --> 01:10:49.963
Yes, you can.
You're gonna be fine.

01:10:50.046 --> 01:10:53.130
And Chloe, why don't you sit in the front
with Ben, okay?

01:10:53.213 --> 01:10:54.421
-All right.
-All right.

01:10:56.921 --> 01:10:58.380
Do you want some free advice?

01:10:58.713 --> 01:10:59.713
Sure.

01:11:00.130 --> 01:11:03.505
You cannot wait
for Chloe to notice you, okay?

01:11:03.588 --> 01:11:05.171
What? I'm not!

01:11:05.255 --> 01:11:06.130
Yeah, no, no.

01:11:06.213 --> 01:11:08.796
A girl like that,
she gets a lot of attention,

01:11:08.880 --> 01:11:11.755
and you have to be reckless. Right?

01:11:12.255 --> 01:11:13.088
What does that mean?

01:11:13.171 --> 01:11:14.671
It means life is short,

01:11:15.005 --> 01:11:17.046
and make your move already, okay?

01:11:31.880 --> 01:11:34.296
<i>Back to throw,</i>
<i>across the middle...</i>

01:11:37.963 --> 01:11:39.630
-Well...
<i>-</i> Shit! Tom is here!

01:11:39.838 --> 01:11:41.755
Oh, shit. Okay, we need a distraction.

01:11:42.005 --> 01:11:42.838
I mean...

01:11:43.380 --> 01:11:44.630
Oh, God!

01:11:45.671 --> 01:11:47.296
I love being a cheerleader.

01:11:47.796 --> 01:11:48.755
Do it, do it!

01:11:49.546 --> 01:11:51.880
- <i>At the 35-30 yard line...</i>

01:11:54.505 --> 01:11:55.505
Is that our car?

01:12:05.171 --> 01:12:06.880
Oh. Son of a...

01:12:12.421 --> 01:12:13.630
What are you doing here?

01:12:15.755 --> 01:12:17.171
It's a rescue mission!

01:12:24.005 --> 01:12:25.088
Now, shh!

01:12:25.171 --> 01:12:26.171
Now be quiet!

01:12:26.255 --> 01:12:27.296
All right, come on.

01:12:27.505 --> 01:12:28.338
Oh, Jesus!

01:12:30.921 --> 01:12:33.588
-Security, Chief Carl.
-Carl, you're not gonna believe this shit.

01:12:33.671 --> 01:12:36.380
Somebody threw a rock
into my goddamn window!

01:12:36.463 --> 01:12:37.963
Any idea who might've done it?

01:12:38.755 --> 01:12:40.505
The gang she's always hanging around with?

01:12:40.588 --> 01:12:41.796
Ah, hurry!

01:12:41.880 --> 01:12:43.380
-Oh, shit!
-Watch that tree.

01:12:43.463 --> 01:12:44.338
No, no, no, wait!

01:12:46.630 --> 01:12:47.546
Call Vicki.

01:12:47.796 --> 01:12:49.671
Sweetie, she's not in here.

01:12:50.046 --> 01:12:51.005
What?

01:12:51.088 --> 01:12:52.046
Door closing!

01:12:52.130 --> 01:12:54.046
Okay, go, go, go!

01:12:54.130 --> 01:12:56.588
Thank God! Praise Jesus!

01:12:56.671 --> 01:12:59.796
-Come on, let's go, go, go!
-You gotta be kiddin' me!

01:13:03.588 --> 01:13:06.338
Mother! Get out of the van, now.

01:13:08.005 --> 01:13:09.296
-Yeah!

01:13:09.380 --> 01:13:11.505
Who's the little slut now?

01:13:20.463 --> 01:13:21.505
Please, stop!

01:13:22.046 --> 01:13:24.046
And Dorris, get out.<i> </i> Please, get out.

01:13:24.213 --> 01:13:26.088
Please, get out.<i> </i> Out!

01:13:26.171 --> 01:13:27.421
Out! Out!

01:13:27.505 --> 01:13:28.630
Okay, let's go, Carl.

01:13:28.713 --> 01:13:30.005
-All right. Hang on.
-Let's go.

01:13:30.088 --> 01:13:31.380
-You in?

01:13:31.838 --> 01:13:33.088
Oh, there they are!

01:13:33.171 --> 01:13:34.796
-Come on! Cut 'em off!
-Hey.

01:13:37.171 --> 01:13:38.588
Oh! Oh!

01:13:41.630 --> 01:13:45.046
Turn off the engine
and step out of the vehicle!

01:13:45.338 --> 01:13:46.630
Drive, drive!

01:13:46.713 --> 01:13:48.505
-Go, go!
-Go!

01:13:48.588 --> 01:13:49.546
Oh, my God.

01:13:49.630 --> 01:13:51.588
-Where are they goin'?
-Just follow 'em.

01:13:51.671 --> 01:13:53.088
-Follow them where?
-Just follow--

01:13:53.171 --> 01:13:55.505
Just follow them! Just turn around!

01:13:56.421 --> 01:13:57.671
Today, Carl!

01:13:58.130 --> 01:13:58.963
Oh!

01:13:59.921 --> 01:14:02.088
Oh, my God! Oh, my gosh!

01:14:02.505 --> 01:14:03.338
Oh!

01:14:03.963 --> 01:14:06.088
Well, can you turn this thing on?

01:14:06.171 --> 01:14:07.171
The siren, the...

01:14:07.255 --> 01:14:09.380
-Oh! Okay! All right!

01:14:11.588 --> 01:14:12.921
Why are we chasing them again?

01:14:13.296 --> 01:14:15.713
What? Oh, for pity's sake!

01:14:16.171 --> 01:14:19.046
They are an unofficial club.

01:14:20.005 --> 01:14:21.421
Go faster!

01:14:21.505 --> 01:14:23.421
It does not go any faster!

01:14:23.796 --> 01:14:25.213
-Floor it!
-It's floored!

01:14:25.296 --> 01:14:27.296
Well, this was a ridiculous purchase,

01:14:27.380 --> 01:14:29.505
and I don't know why
you didn't express that

01:14:29.588 --> 01:14:31.380
at the time the check was being written!

01:14:36.546 --> 01:14:37.463
Oh!

01:14:38.130 --> 01:14:39.546
Hi, Vicki!

01:14:55.963 --> 01:14:57.380
Where are you all going?

01:14:57.463 --> 01:14:59.713
Heading to the cheerleading competition.
Wanna go?

01:15:00.171 --> 01:15:02.338
Is that a serious question, David?

01:15:03.380 --> 01:15:05.171
And what do you think you're doing?

01:15:05.255 --> 01:15:07.171
-I wanna see what's gonna happen.
-Come on, Carl!

01:15:07.255 --> 01:15:08.421
-Well, go on, then!
-I'm going.

01:15:08.505 --> 01:15:10.755
-Just go on with your bad self!
- I am going!

01:15:10.838 --> 01:15:12.171
Panty-chaser!

01:15:12.255 --> 01:15:13.213
Turncoat!

01:15:13.296 --> 01:15:15.463
Sticks and stones, Vicki!
Sticks and stones!

01:15:15.921 --> 01:15:16.796
Traitor!

01:15:21.838 --> 01:15:22.796
Hurry!

01:15:23.546 --> 01:15:25.421
We're late! Go in! Okay!

01:15:26.005 --> 01:15:26.963
The music!

01:15:27.046 --> 01:15:28.046
Here, I got it, I got it.

01:15:28.130 --> 01:15:30.171
Yeah. I'll check us in. Don't worry.
Here, you got it?

01:15:30.255 --> 01:15:31.088
I got it.

01:15:31.171 --> 01:15:33.171
Thank you. Um, hi. Where do I sign in?

01:15:33.588 --> 01:15:35.880
Sure, which squad
is your granddaughter competing in?

01:15:37.130 --> 01:15:39.338
Uh, my granddaughter is not competing.

01:15:40.213 --> 01:15:42.130
I am. Sun Springs.

01:15:42.546 --> 01:15:43.421
And, um...

01:15:43.505 --> 01:15:45.671
It says here you've been disqualified.

01:15:48.380 --> 01:15:49.921
Just breathe, stretch.

01:15:50.338 --> 01:15:51.963
-You got this.
-Yeah.

01:15:52.046 --> 01:15:55.255
Don't even worry about it. Just worry
about your routine and everything.

01:15:56.588 --> 01:15:57.630
You need anything?

01:15:57.713 --> 01:15:59.755
-Yes, air.
- Mmm.

01:15:59.838 --> 01:16:01.130
Yeah. You just gotta breathe.

01:16:01.213 --> 01:16:02.755
Our next squad performing...

01:16:02.838 --> 01:16:04.130
Oh, shit.

01:16:04.213 --> 01:16:06.046
...for the very first time,

01:16:06.130 --> 01:16:08.755
all the way from Jacksonville, Florida.

01:16:10.130 --> 01:16:12.296
What are you doing here?
I thought you quit.

01:16:12.713 --> 01:16:13.671
We came to cheer.

01:16:15.921 --> 01:16:17.213
Are you serious?

01:16:17.296 --> 01:16:19.546
- Cannot be serious.
- They're competing?

01:16:19.838 --> 01:16:20.671
Yeah.

01:16:20.755 --> 01:16:22.213
-We are.

01:16:22.296 --> 01:16:23.130
Uh...

01:16:25.005 --> 01:16:26.130
Okay.

01:16:26.796 --> 01:16:27.963
Pathetic.

01:16:28.338 --> 01:16:29.921
-Bye.
- Bye, good luck.

01:16:30.255 --> 01:16:31.130
Good luck.

01:16:32.463 --> 01:16:33.296
Hey!

01:16:34.171 --> 01:16:36.921
Hey. What'd she mean about you quitting?

01:16:37.421 --> 01:16:40.380
Oh, I was just too busy, you know,
with school and everything.

01:16:40.463 --> 01:16:41.588
I-I couldn't do both.

01:16:41.671 --> 01:16:43.880
Oh, honey. I'm sorry.

01:16:44.213 --> 01:16:45.838
We didn't want you quitting for us.

01:16:45.921 --> 01:16:48.130
No, no, no, no, no. I-I wanted to.

01:16:48.880 --> 01:16:52.630
I've never had a grandma before,
and now it's like I have eight.

01:16:55.171 --> 01:16:56.796
Oh.

01:17:08.880 --> 01:17:10.671
Your group is too old to compete.

01:17:10.755 --> 01:17:13.671
The entry form says
there's an 18 and over category,

01:17:13.755 --> 01:17:14.921
and we're over 18.

01:17:15.005 --> 01:17:18.421
-This competition is for young women only.
-What's going on here?

01:17:18.505 --> 01:17:19.463
Oh, my God!

01:17:19.546 --> 01:17:20.713
Oh, Chief Carl.

01:17:21.838 --> 01:17:24.755
Well, she's saying that we can't compete.

01:17:25.005 --> 01:17:27.255
You didn't mention
your age on the application.

01:17:27.921 --> 01:17:28.755
Chief Carl.

01:17:29.588 --> 01:17:30.546
Special Branch Division.

01:17:31.171 --> 01:17:33.713
You're in express violation
of both State and Federal law.

01:17:33.796 --> 01:17:35.671
Statute 42, Section 8, Verse 3.

01:17:36.005 --> 01:17:37.880
If you don't let these women compete,

01:17:37.963 --> 01:17:39.921
I'm gonna have to haul your ass
down to the station

01:17:40.005 --> 01:17:42.463
and throw the book at you
for age discrimination.

01:17:42.921 --> 01:17:45.380
Now, we can do this the easy way,

01:17:46.005 --> 01:17:47.338
or we can do it the hard way.

01:17:47.796 --> 01:17:50.255
And just for the record,
I prefer the hard way.

01:17:53.921 --> 01:17:55.171
You're on in ten minutes.

01:17:56.755 --> 01:17:57.963
God, that was amazing!

01:17:58.046 --> 01:18:00.838
I can't believe they fell for it.
I made the whole thing up right there!

01:18:00.921 --> 01:18:02.546
You did, didn't you? Come on, let's go.

01:18:11.630 --> 01:18:13.421
Oh, jeez. Oh, my God.

01:18:13.505 --> 01:18:16.671
What took you so long?
Everybody's freaking out!

01:18:16.755 --> 01:18:17.755
I feel sick!

01:18:17.838 --> 01:18:21.088
My stupid dickhead husband was right!
I can't do this!

01:18:21.171 --> 01:18:22.796
Yeah, you're not going anywhere. No.

01:18:22.880 --> 01:18:25.046
-No, no, no, no.
-All right, ladies. Huddle up. Come on.

01:18:25.130 --> 01:18:26.546
-Okay, let's huddle.
-Come on.

01:18:26.630 --> 01:18:27.630
Phew, okay.

01:18:27.838 --> 01:18:28.755
Come on.

01:18:29.421 --> 01:18:32.046
Guys, don't worry about the audience!

01:18:32.338 --> 01:18:35.130
Just follow each other
like we practiced, okay?

01:18:35.213 --> 01:18:36.255
We got this.

01:18:37.546 --> 01:18:38.671
-Martha?
- Hmm?

01:18:38.921 --> 01:18:40.380
Anything you'd like to add?

01:18:42.880 --> 01:18:44.630
I know I told you we could do this.

01:18:45.130 --> 01:18:48.463
But the truth is I have no idea
what's gonna happen out there.

01:18:48.546 --> 01:18:50.671
Maybe we'll make
fools of ourselves, right?

01:18:52.546 --> 01:18:54.380
But I do know one thing.

01:18:56.005 --> 01:18:58.255
There's no one
I'd rather go out there with...

01:18:58.671 --> 01:19:00.088
than you ladies.

01:19:02.630 --> 01:19:06.880
I love you! I love you all! Okay?

01:19:06.963 --> 01:19:08.296
Now, I know you're scared.

01:19:08.380 --> 01:19:10.088
Whoo! I'm scared, too.

01:19:10.588 --> 01:19:11.463
Scared?

01:19:12.838 --> 01:19:13.880
But, you know,

01:19:13.963 --> 01:19:18.505
sometimes you just have to look that shit
in the face and tell it to go to hell!

01:19:24.213 --> 01:19:25.088
