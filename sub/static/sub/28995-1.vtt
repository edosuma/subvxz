Got any service up here?

01:44.638 --> 01:46.805
I've never
in my life had service here.

01:46.807 --> 01:49.641
Has there ever
been service here?

01:49.643 --> 01:51.743
Dude, Mel is gonna kill me.

01:51.745 --> 01:53.645
What did you do this time?

01:53.647 --> 01:56.715
I was supposed to
text her before we came up here.

01:56.717 --> 01:59.384
- That's it?
- And, um...

02:03.324 --> 02:05.891
I take it you got service.

02:07.695 --> 02:10.329
Wow! What did you do?

02:11.332 --> 02:12.498
Holy shit.

02:25.513 --> 02:27.212
Can I get you anything?

02:32.786 --> 02:34.419
Are you sure?

02:43.697 --> 02:46.698
What are we all doing
in the bathroom?

02:55.643 --> 02:58.777
Oh, Mama.

03:04.652 --> 03:06.785
Yeah, bro, we have
to get the cigarettes.

03:06.787 --> 03:09.488
Isn't that your English teacher?

03:09.490 --> 03:10.889
Yes, it is.

03:10.891 --> 03:13.759
- Mr. Ford!
- Yo, what's up?

03:13.761 --> 03:15.794
Oh, hey, guys.
How's your summer goin'?

03:15.796 --> 03:17.930
It's hot. Sucks.
Can you buy us some cigarettes?

03:17.932 --> 03:19.631
- Yeah, bro'.
- What?

03:19.633 --> 03:21.833
- No, you guys are kids, come on.
- What?

03:21.835 --> 03:24.369
You smoke all the time.
We've seen you.

03:25.639 --> 03:29.408
- Well, it's illegal, okay?
- Are you serious?

03:30.945 --> 03:32.711
Lame.
I'll steal them from my mom.

03:32.713 --> 03:34.413
Stay out of trouble, guys.

03:35.849 --> 03:37.316
You know, that was us once.

03:39.853 --> 03:41.353
Still is.

03:43.324 --> 03:45.691
If children are
the future, we're fucked.

03:46.961 --> 03:48.827
You know what?

03:48.829 --> 03:51.463
I don't think I'm going
back to that teaching job.

03:51.465 --> 03:52.931
Why, 'cause of that kid?

03:52.933 --> 03:55.334
No, man, I just
don't really care, you know?

03:58.572 --> 04:00.172
So, like, what's the point?

04:00.173 --> 04:01.773
You gonna hang around and be
an asshole like the rest of us?

04:02.843 --> 04:05.277
You sound like my dad.

04:14.688 --> 04:15.954
Hey, sweetie?

04:15.956 --> 04:17.555
How 'bout we
just take a little break

04:17.558 --> 04:20.024
from texting for now, okay?

04:20.027 --> 04:22.261
This was not the plan.

04:22.263 --> 04:24.029
I still have three more years
of grad school.

04:24.031 --> 04:26.398
I just don't even see
how this can work.

04:26.400 --> 04:31.003
Okay, stop beating yourself
up, for fuck's sake, Mel!

04:31.005 --> 04:33.405
You didn't do anything wrong.

04:33.407 --> 04:36.875
And, honestly, it's not like you
have to make the decision right now.

04:36.877 --> 04:39.378
So, the first thing
we're gonna do

04:39.380 --> 04:40.812
is we're gonna get you
out of the tub.

04:40.814 --> 04:41.980
- Out of the tub.
- Oh, my god.

04:41.982 --> 04:43.915
We're gonna go downstairs,

04:43.917 --> 04:45.984
we're gonna watch a movie,
and it's gonna be really fun.

04:45.986 --> 04:47.486
- I want my phone.
- No.

04:50.424 --> 04:51.990
It's Jack.

04:51.992 --> 04:56.295
Oh, okay, that's it.
I'm getting margarita stuff.

04:56.297 --> 04:58.497
Well, it's not really
the time for margaritas--

04:58.499 --> 05:00.465
I'll make hers a virgin.

05:01.535 --> 05:03.068
- Sorry. Can I--?
- Go, go, go, go.

05:03.070 --> 05:04.569
Hi, Jack.

05:04.571 --> 05:06.972
No, I know I called,
and I'm so sorry,

05:06.974 --> 05:09.641
but now's really
not a good time.

05:09.643 --> 05:11.610
You said it was important.
What's up?

05:11.612 --> 05:13.512
I know I said that,
and it is,

05:13.514 --> 05:16.315
but it's really not a good time.

05:16.317 --> 05:18.550
So, can I just see you
at the show?

05:18.552 --> 05:22.421
You're freaking me out.
Just tell me what's going on.

05:22.423 --> 05:26.925
Okay, well, at my sister's
wedding last weekend...

05:28.595 --> 05:30.962
Well, I, um...

05:32.666 --> 05:33.965
I met a guy.

05:36.704 --> 05:40.439
Jack? Are you still there?

05:40.441 --> 05:42.074
Hey, Rabbit!

05:45.813 --> 05:47.512
So, what's up with you and Mel?

05:47.514 --> 05:48.980
Can't tell you.

05:48.982 --> 05:51.083
What the fuck do you mean,
you can't tell me?

05:51.085 --> 05:53.685
That's bullshit. Talk to me.

05:54.621 --> 05:55.954
Wish I could.

05:57.591 --> 06:00.125
All right, fine. I'll just
drive over there myself,

06:00.127 --> 06:01.960
- and I'll fuckin' ask her.
- No, come on, man.

06:01.962 --> 06:04.596
Yo, seriously.
Don't do that.

06:04.598 --> 06:06.698
- Yo!
- Here we go.

06:06.700 --> 06:08.533
Dude, just pull over!

06:08.535 --> 06:10.936
Jesus, man, what
the fuck is wrong with you?

06:10.938 --> 06:12.637
You trying to kill us?

06:12.639 --> 06:13.939
Yo, can you please
pull over, man?

06:13.941 --> 06:15.374
This is why
you don't have a car.

06:15.376 --> 06:17.509
- Fuck, Christ, dude!
- Fuck you.

06:17.511 --> 06:19.544
Dude, you have no fuckin' idea
what you're doing.

06:19.546 --> 06:22.714
- Stop this shit, man!
- Oh, hello, Vanessa.

06:23.717 --> 06:25.784
Wonder what she's doing?

06:25.786 --> 06:27.119
Oww!

06:28.922 --> 06:31.089
- Hey, buddy.
- What's going on?

06:31.091 --> 06:34.159
Oh, you know,
the usual disasters.

06:34.161 --> 06:37.863
- Yeah?
- Hey, have you seen Seth?

06:37.865 --> 06:40.565
You know, I just saw
him a second ago.

06:40.567 --> 06:42.134
Well, when you talk to him,

06:42.136 --> 06:44.002
tell him he needs to call Mel.

06:44.004 --> 06:46.705
Okay, I'll pass that along.
What is the deal with them?

06:46.707 --> 06:50.909
I can't really say, but, um...

06:50.911 --> 06:53.845
just tell Seth to get his ass
over here, okay?

06:53.847 --> 06:55.781
Hey, I'll see you later,
right?

06:55.783 --> 07:00.519
- What's later?
- Come on, you're going.

07:01.488 --> 07:02.687
Of course I'm going, dickhead.

07:02.689 --> 07:04.523
I'll see you at the Alamo.

07:07.528 --> 07:09.594
You happy?

07:09.596 --> 07:12.531
Fuck. I hate you.

07:12.533 --> 07:15.033
Sounds like
you're really in for it.

07:15.035 --> 07:17.769
Yeah.

07:17.771 --> 07:19.671
Look, I'm sorry
for hassling you, man.

07:19.673 --> 07:21.773
It sounds like
it's bigger than I thought.

07:21.775 --> 07:23.608
Yeah, it fuckin' is.

07:25.145 --> 07:26.812
Well, whatever "it" is,

07:26.814 --> 07:29.681
you better just talk
to her about it, right?

07:30.617 --> 07:32.083
You can't hide from it.

07:37.858 --> 07:39.724
Just let me out.

07:39.726 --> 07:41.159
No, I'll drive you over there.

07:41.161 --> 07:42.994
Just, seriously, dude,
just pull over.

07:42.996 --> 07:45.130
Dude, it's like
a thousand degrees out here.

07:45.132 --> 07:47.466
Yeah, no, I know.
I gotta clear my head.

07:47.468 --> 07:49.201
All right, fine.

08:15.829 --> 08:18.029
Rraaaarrr!

08:18.031 --> 08:20.866
Oh, fuck, man, that hurt.

08:23.003 --> 08:24.903
- Stay down, bitch!
- Fuck!

08:24.905 --> 08:27.005
Okay, get his wallet.

08:27.007 --> 08:28.173
And his phone.

08:28.175 --> 08:30.041
That's not his fuckin' phone.

08:30.043 --> 08:31.843
Give him
your fuckin' phone

08:31.845 --> 08:34.011
- or I'll fuckin' cut your dick off!
- Take the phone.

08:34.014 --> 08:35.981
- I'm attached to my dick.
- Do it!

08:35.982 --> 08:38.116
We need to get outta here.

08:38.118 --> 08:41.620
All right.
Wait, I want his shoes.

08:42.722 --> 08:44.022
Fuck off! Come on.

08:44.024 --> 08:46.258
My shoes, man. Are you serious?

08:47.961 --> 08:50.595
Call the cops,
we'll murder you in your sleep!

08:50.597 --> 08:52.931
You assholes have my phone!

08:54.735 --> 08:56.902
Fuck!

09:03.877 --> 09:06.011
What's up there, Andy-boy?

09:08.949 --> 09:10.782
What are you getting
up to today?

09:12.853 --> 09:15.186
Spreading the sweetness
and the light

09:15.188 --> 09:17.923
to all I come into contact with.

09:17.925 --> 09:22.627
Thinking positive,
positive thoughts.

09:22.629 --> 09:25.797
Very, very sexy.

09:25.799 --> 09:27.799
Oh, you got that rent check?

09:28.969 --> 09:30.802
Yeah. I'll write a check later.

09:30.804 --> 09:35.307
All right.
Mucho apreciado, brother.

09:35.309 --> 09:37.275
Pumped for the show tonight?

09:37.277 --> 09:38.843
Yeah. I got a date.

09:38.845 --> 09:41.880
Really? Nice one, Jammers.

09:41.882 --> 09:43.982
Who's the lucky lady?

09:43.984 --> 09:46.351
- This party girl, Harmony.
- Okay.

09:48.055 --> 09:51.690
So Gatsby finally gave up
the dream of the golden girl.

09:51.692 --> 09:53.959
I was not Gatsby over Corin.

09:53.961 --> 09:59.164
I'm gonna go inside and shower before
you disprove that with written evidence.

10:02.903 --> 10:06.638
I'll just be out here
all alone...

10:06.640 --> 10:08.707
all by myself.

10:16.650 --> 10:18.883
Our wayward Jack Rabbit.

10:18.885 --> 10:22.887
Out of the cold into the fold
after prodigious prodigality.

10:22.889 --> 10:24.189
How are you, old boy?

10:24.191 --> 10:27.192
Hey, Andy. I talked to Lexi.

10:27.194 --> 10:29.761
Lexi. I like her.

10:29.763 --> 10:31.129
She slept with some bro

10:31.131 --> 10:32.797
at her sister's wedding
last weekend.

10:32.799 --> 10:34.132
I hate her.

10:34.134 --> 10:37.002
- Jameson, get out here!
- What's up?

10:37.004 --> 10:41.006
Lexi got boinked by some dude
at her sister's wedding.

10:41.008 --> 10:42.941
Shit.

10:43.844 --> 10:45.910
Not the groom, I hope.

10:45.912 --> 10:48.346
Groomsman.
Some water polo player.

10:50.283 --> 10:51.883
I'm really sorry, man.

10:51.885 --> 10:53.351
I know you had your heart
set on her.

10:53.353 --> 10:55.153
Well, it's all right.

10:55.155 --> 10:57.789
She's not my girlfriend.
She never was.

10:57.791 --> 11:01.426
I guess Santa Barbara
meatheads are her type.

11:03.096 --> 11:04.929
Jameson, get this man a beer.

11:04.931 --> 11:07.399
Have I gotta do
everything around here?

11:07.401 --> 11:09.000
You got it.

11:21.682 --> 11:22.881
Why'd she tell you?

11:24.184 --> 11:28.253
I don't know.
She probably feels weird.

11:28.255 --> 11:30.055
Maybe to see how I'd react.

11:30.057 --> 11:34.025
- How did you react?
- About like this.

11:34.027 --> 11:36.961
She does understand
that you don't express emotions

11:36.963 --> 11:39.364
- like a normal person, right?
- Thanks.

11:39.366 --> 11:41.266
Was she apologizing?

11:41.268 --> 11:43.968
It was more like confessing?

11:49.443 --> 11:51.409
Sh-- She was a virgin.

11:51.411 --> 11:54.012
- Like you.
- Yeah, let's not talk about it.

11:54.014 --> 11:57.982
Jack Rabbit, talk about it.
It'd be good for you.

11:59.086 --> 12:00.485
It's fine.

12:00.487 --> 12:03.021
She didn't cheat on me.
We're friends.

12:03.023 --> 12:05.990
Girls get drunk and screw
at weddings. It happens.

12:09.262 --> 12:11.196
Not with me, but it happens.

12:12.332 --> 12:15.467
I'm very sorry, Jack Rabbit.

12:15.469 --> 12:17.268
I really gotta get ready.

12:17.270 --> 12:19.204
Are you sure you don't wanna
talk about this?

12:19.206 --> 12:21.072
No, absolutely not.

12:21.074 --> 12:23.007
I regret
saying anything already.

12:26.446 --> 12:28.313
You know what makes
me feel better?

12:28.315 --> 12:29.447
Beer?

12:29.449 --> 12:33.485
No. Yes, but no.

12:51.037 --> 12:57.242
Yaaaah!

13:30.310 --> 13:31.810
Taylor?

13:33.246 --> 13:35.113
Hey, you're, uh...

13:35.115 --> 13:37.549
You're Wells'
little sister, right?

13:37.551 --> 13:39.317
What happened to you?

13:39.319 --> 13:41.019
I was-- I was biking,

13:41.021 --> 13:44.055
and a couple of guys hit me.
Is it bad?

13:44.057 --> 13:45.824
Yeah, you're bleeding.

13:45.826 --> 13:48.960
Yeah, I feel kinda crazy
'cause of all the adrenaline.

13:48.962 --> 13:50.528
I'm gonna--
I'm gonna sit down.

13:50.530 --> 13:52.130
I'm gonna sit down.

13:52.132 --> 13:53.531
Okay.

13:55.068 --> 13:56.868
I think you need stitches.

13:56.870 --> 13:59.103
I'm not gonna pay a doctor
for stitches. I'll just--

13:59.105 --> 14:00.305
I'll superglue it.

14:01.541 --> 14:03.575
- I gotta lie down.
- Oh, no. No, no, no.

14:03.577 --> 14:05.977
I think you might have
gotten a concussion.

14:05.979 --> 14:07.378
Okay.

14:07.380 --> 14:09.848
We are gonna get you
some butterfly bandages.

14:09.850 --> 14:11.549
Wait here.

14:13.386 --> 14:14.519
Fuck!

14:14.521 --> 14:16.588
No, no, no. Come on.

14:24.130 --> 14:28.299
Super gluing your face together
is, like, really white trash.

14:30.170 --> 14:33.438
Taste that, man?
It's that blueberry shit, man.

14:35.208 --> 14:37.175
Blueberry antioxidants.

14:40.080 --> 14:41.980
Oh, shit, man.

14:41.982 --> 14:44.415
- This shit tastes like blueberries, Ricky.
- Let me hit it.

14:44.417 --> 14:46.317
I wanna put that shit
on my pancakes.

14:46.319 --> 14:48.019
Mm! That's my jam!

14:50.557 --> 14:53.658
Yo, it tastes like
my grandma's blueberry cobbler.

14:53.660 --> 14:54.959
Oh, yeah!

14:56.296 --> 14:59.097
Oh, wait.
Actually, this is strawberry.

15:02.102 --> 15:03.334
Classic.

15:03.336 --> 15:05.436
Yo! Seth!

15:05.438 --> 15:08.539
- Oh, shit!
- What are you doing here, man?

15:08.541 --> 15:10.008
Come in here.

15:10.010 --> 15:13.478
- What's up, man?
- Hit this shit.

15:13.480 --> 15:15.613
Yeah, it's blueberry.

15:15.615 --> 15:16.981
It's strawberry.

15:16.983 --> 15:21.352
- It's strawberry.
- Yeah, man?

15:21.354 --> 15:23.087
Good shit, huh?

15:23.089 --> 15:25.456
Let's keep on that, brother.
Come on.

15:30.263 --> 15:33.131
- Poor face.
- Is it that bad?

15:33.133 --> 15:34.599
Now you're worried?

15:34.601 --> 15:38.336
You were gonna superglue
yourself back together.

15:39.973 --> 15:41.940
It's real nice of you to buy
all this stuff.

15:41.942 --> 15:44.475
- I'll pay you back.
- Oh, no, no, don't mention it.

15:46.513 --> 15:50.648
You are all set.

15:53.053 --> 15:56.621
I don't know what to say.
This is so nice of you.

16:01.428 --> 16:03.294
Look, there's a cop.
Go talk to him.

16:03.296 --> 16:05.596
- They've gotta catch those guys.
- Thanks.

16:05.598 --> 16:09.200
Um, my band's playing
the Alamo tonight.

16:09.202 --> 16:10.268
You should come.

16:10.270 --> 16:13.237
Cool. Yeah, maybe.

16:13.239 --> 16:15.640
No, seriously, I mean it.
Come to the show.

16:17.177 --> 16:19.010
All right.

16:19.012 --> 16:20.411
Thanks.

16:20.413 --> 16:22.447
Uh, excuse me, Officer.

16:23.483 --> 16:26.150
I just got jumped
on the bike path.

16:26.152 --> 16:28.753
Shit. Another one.

16:28.755 --> 16:31.622
All right, hop in. I'll take
you home and do a report.

16:35.128 --> 16:36.461
What the hell are you doing?

16:36.463 --> 16:38.129
They take your shoes?

16:38.131 --> 16:40.098
Just hop in the car.
You're not in trouble.

16:41.067 --> 16:42.266
See you tonight.

16:44.371 --> 16:48.539
- Hey, can we use the sirens?
- Sure.

17:03.690 --> 17:07.492
- Is that Seth?
- Come in.

17:10.530 --> 17:12.797
Daughter, how was
the moving picture tonight?

17:12.799 --> 17:15.133
Hey.

17:15.135 --> 17:17.035
Hey, Sethy.

17:18.137 --> 17:20.304
I didn't think you had it in ya.

17:20.306 --> 17:23.407
Oh, well, then I'll stick to these.
These don't talk.

17:23.410 --> 17:26.344
That big buck Norman
Maine was in the picture tonight.

17:26.346 --> 17:28.613
Never does anything
but kiss a lot of girls.

17:43.163 --> 17:44.796
- Are you high right now?
- No.

17:44.798 --> 17:47.265
I can't have this conversation
if you're fucked up.

17:47.267 --> 17:50.735
I'm not, okay?
I'm just, I'm freaked out.

17:50.737 --> 17:53.704
Yeah! Well.

17:53.706 --> 17:56.774
I feel like I just don't wanna
do anything stupid.

17:56.776 --> 17:58.276
Oh, it's a little late for that.

17:58.278 --> 17:59.710
What's that supposed to mean?

17:59.712 --> 18:02.146
- You came inside of me, Seth.
- You told me to.

18:02.148 --> 18:03.815
No, I know,
but I didn't actually mean it.

18:03.817 --> 18:06.184
It was like a passion,
heat-of-the-moment thing.

18:06.186 --> 18:09.420
I didn't... mean it.

18:09.422 --> 18:10.688
Mel, I just do what you say.

18:10.690 --> 18:13.825
No, I'm not blaming you.
I just...

18:17.797 --> 18:20.598
I need to know
what you think about it.

18:23.670 --> 18:26.637
I don't know what
I'm supposed to say, all right?

18:26.639 --> 18:31.843
Like, you just seem really mad
at me right now.

18:54.300 --> 18:55.800
What are you doing?

18:55.802 --> 18:57.602
It's Caleb, all right?
I gotta hit Caleb back.

18:57.604 --> 19:00.471
I'm fucking pregnant, Seth.
And you're texting Caleb?

19:00.473 --> 19:02.140
Are you telling him about this?

19:02.142 --> 19:03.708
Because you probably want
me to get an abortion,

19:03.710 --> 19:05.443
but I have
a fucking fetus growing

19:05.445 --> 19:07.678
- in fucking whatever this is.
- Mel. Mel.

19:07.680 --> 19:11.883
I never said anything about
you getting an abortion, okay?

19:11.885 --> 19:14.519
Whether you wanna keep the baby,
that's not my call.

19:14.521 --> 19:16.287
And I'm not telling Caleb
about anything, okay?

19:16.289 --> 19:18.356
I'm just saying that I'm
gonna be late to sound check,

19:18.358 --> 19:20.591
and he's pissed
'cause I'm not telling him why.

19:22.428 --> 19:24.295
That's not your call?

19:30.503 --> 19:31.702
No.

19:33.907 --> 19:37.375
You should really figure out
what's important to you, Seth.

19:45.185 --> 19:46.417
Just go.

19:51.191 --> 19:52.390
Okay.

20:37.470 --> 20:38.903
What I'm saying is

20:38.905 --> 20:40.838
that rock 'n' roll
started going downhill

20:40.840 --> 20:42.907
when they stopped
having saxophone players.

20:42.909 --> 20:45.276
I'm talking about Bobby Keys,
Clarence Clemons.

20:45.278 --> 20:46.844
I'm talking about the time

20:46.846 --> 20:49.880
when rock 'n' roll used
to stir positive emotions

20:49.882 --> 20:52.984
with big backing horns, dude.

20:52.986 --> 20:54.885
That's all gone now.

20:56.022 --> 20:58.889
Oh. I love nacho cheese so much.

21:02.462 --> 21:03.694
Mel's pregnant.

21:05.965 --> 21:07.999
What?!

21:08.001 --> 21:09.467
Yeah.

21:10.470 --> 21:11.969
What the fuck, dude?

21:11.971 --> 21:14.038
How the fuck do you get
your girlfriend pregnant?

21:14.040 --> 21:17.875
This is isn't 1937.
And weren't you using a condom?

21:17.877 --> 21:19.610
Isn't she on birth control?

21:19.612 --> 21:21.812
This is offensively
irresponsible, okay?

21:21.814 --> 21:24.315
- Think about the band.
- Can you please calm down?

21:24.317 --> 21:27.718
- I will not calm down!
- I'm supposed to be the one freaking out right now.

21:29.555 --> 21:30.921
What's she wanna do?

21:30.923 --> 21:33.891
Fuck, man, I can't be a dad.

21:35.528 --> 21:38.062
- Shit.
- Oh, shit, just act normal.

21:38.064 --> 21:39.797
And stay off
the bike trail, please.

21:39.799 --> 21:41.465
- Thanks very much.
- Have a good night.

21:41.467 --> 21:43.834
Taylor?

21:43.836 --> 21:45.469
Yo, what happened
to your face, man?

21:45.471 --> 21:48.406
- I need a drink.
- Get in a fight or something?

21:50.476 --> 21:51.942
Okay, let's do this.

21:51.944 --> 21:53.477
Alamo!

21:53.479 --> 21:55.379
- Hey, Corin.
- Oh, hey, Taylor.

21:55.381 --> 21:56.981
- Can I have a beer?
- Yeah, sure.

21:56.983 --> 21:59.016
- Thank you.
- Hi, handsome.

21:59.018 --> 22:00.818
Oh, shit, what happened
to your face?

22:00.820 --> 22:02.453
Ah, you know.

22:02.455 --> 22:04.588
- You fighting cheetahs again?
- Yes, I was.

22:04.590 --> 22:06.490
- What's up, man?
- You look like shit.

22:06.492 --> 22:07.958
Did you get attacked
by a seagull?

22:07.960 --> 22:09.560
Your face looks wrecked.

22:09.562 --> 22:11.329
You think it'll ruin
my modeling career?

22:11.331 --> 22:12.963
You okay, man?

22:12.965 --> 22:14.765
A couple of tweakers jumped
me on the bike path.

22:14.767 --> 22:16.734
But this real nice cop
took me home.

22:16.736 --> 22:18.769
Got my shoes, got my bass,
so I'm all good.

22:18.771 --> 22:19.970
- Damn.
- Hey, guys.

22:19.972 --> 22:22.673
- Man.
- How much did they take?

22:22.675 --> 22:25.409
I think, just like 20 bucks,

22:25.411 --> 22:28.012
but, you know,
they took my phone

22:28.014 --> 22:30.681
and my brother's bike,
so there's that.

22:30.683 --> 22:32.616
Shit, dude.

22:32.618 --> 22:36.020
So some methhead is looking
at your collection of dick pics.

22:36.022 --> 22:37.388
Well, I hope so.

22:37.390 --> 22:38.723
Hey, Smokey, can I have an E?

22:38.725 --> 22:40.024
Small collection.

22:52.538 --> 22:56.374
- Hi. I'm Jame--
- Harmony, your date's here!

23:01.881 --> 23:03.781
Okay! Justin Lerner,

23:03.783 --> 23:06.817
the vacuum cleaner
repairing poet!

23:06.819 --> 23:09.787
You ever write poems about
repairing vacuum cleaners, Justin?

23:09.789 --> 23:12.490
Uh, no, sir, I don't.

23:12.492 --> 23:15.025
All right,
you ready to give this a shot?

23:15.027 --> 23:17.795
- Yes, I am.
- Okay! Give her a whirl!

23:21.934 --> 23:23.667
Hey, Jameson.

23:23.669 --> 23:26.971
It's landed on 200!

23:26.973 --> 23:28.472
Very good. Now, Justin--

23:28.474 --> 23:30.875
Hey. Who's this little cutie?

23:32.645 --> 23:34.545
You know I have a kid, right?

23:35.982 --> 23:37.815
No, I didn't.

23:40.653 --> 23:43.587
- You look freaked out.
- No, I just didn't know.

23:43.589 --> 23:45.623
He'd like to solve the puzzle.

23:45.625 --> 23:47.691
Go ahead, Justin.

23:47.693 --> 23:50.828
"Be careful
what you wish for"?

23:52.965 --> 23:54.198
I'm fucking with you.

23:55.568 --> 23:57.835
This is Annie.
She's my sister's.

23:59.038 --> 24:00.671
All right.

24:00.673 --> 24:02.673
She's fed, she's clean,
she's changed.

24:02.675 --> 24:05.509
She should really go to bed now.

24:05.511 --> 24:07.077
- Okay.
- And turn off the TV.

24:07.079 --> 24:09.513
Read her a book,
for fuck's sake.

24:10.750 --> 24:11.916
Let's go.

24:13.753 --> 24:16.053
I never wear a
seatbelt, but I'm starting to feel

24:16.055 --> 24:18.055
like I should wear
a seatbelt in your car.

24:18.057 --> 24:21.492
- Why, am I scaring you?
- I don't know why.

24:21.494 --> 24:24.462
I'm just starting to realize
how much I like being alive.

24:24.464 --> 24:26.630
Come on, this is being alive,
Jameson!

24:29.469 --> 24:31.035
Yes.

24:31.037 --> 24:32.603
Ah!

24:32.605 --> 24:35.906
- You like Destroyer?
- I love Destroyer.

24:35.908 --> 24:37.675
The horns in it remind me
of Springsteen,

24:37.677 --> 24:39.243
which reminds me of my dad.

24:39.245 --> 24:41.879
He was a Springsteen guy,
you know?

24:41.881 --> 24:44.815
The only thing he loved more than
The Boss was me and my sister.

24:52.959 --> 24:54.525
Where's your dad now?

24:54.527 --> 24:55.893
He's dead.

24:59.198 --> 25:02.566
- God, I'm really sorry.
- I was a kid.

25:02.568 --> 25:03.901
Work accident.
He was a lineman.

25:03.903 --> 25:05.736
My parents were divorced
when it happened.

25:05.738 --> 25:07.938
My mom's been married
a bunch of times since then.

25:07.940 --> 25:09.507
Ooh, a spot.

25:18.818 --> 25:21.652
Hi, everyone. Thank you.

25:21.654 --> 25:25.923
We're Rain and Rivers,
and we're stoked to be here.

25:25.925 --> 25:27.825
We're stoked that you're here.

25:27.827 --> 25:32.663

27:07.760 --> 27:09.193
Scotch and soda.

27:13.933 --> 27:16.000
Scotch and soda.

27:20.706 --> 27:21.972
How do I look?

27:23.242 --> 27:25.142
You're going out tonight?

27:25.144 --> 27:27.277
Yeah, I'm going to the show.

27:27.279 --> 27:30.080
You sure you don't wanna stay in
and actually be supportive?

27:30.082 --> 27:32.016
Ah, it's fine.

27:32.018 --> 27:35.686
Lexi, don't pull
that Mother Teresa shit with me.

27:35.688 --> 27:38.288
Girl, I'll be a badass aunt,

27:38.290 --> 27:40.924
or I'll drive you
to the clinic.

27:40.926 --> 27:43.894
Whatever you want,
I'm your main bitch.

27:43.896 --> 27:47.364
But you can't
just sit around being sad.

27:48.868 --> 27:51.268
I don't think
I'd be much fun tonight.

27:51.270 --> 27:53.103
Okay, look.

27:53.105 --> 27:55.973
Relationships are a competition,

27:55.975 --> 28:00.377
and right now,
you are letting Seth win.

28:06.085 --> 28:08.385
I didn't know Taylor was back.

28:08.387 --> 28:10.754
I think I shall
get very drunk indeed.

28:10.756 --> 28:12.222
I've gotta change.

28:13.693 --> 28:15.693
Hey, how are you guys?

28:15.695 --> 28:17.394
Here you go. Have a good one.

28:17.396 --> 28:19.897
Hey, how are you?

28:19.899 --> 28:21.999
- Okay, you're all good.
- Thank you.

28:22.001 --> 28:23.767
There you go.

28:23.769 --> 28:25.269
Jameson, hey! How are you?

28:25.271 --> 28:28.138
Hey, Corin, I'm good.
How are you?

28:28.140 --> 28:29.707
Good.

28:29.709 --> 28:31.375
Hey, so are you going out
after the show?

28:31.377 --> 28:34.311
I wanna talk to you tonight.

28:34.313 --> 28:36.113
You know,
when I'm off the clock.

28:36.115 --> 28:37.748
Yeah, I mean,
I'm sure I'll be out,

28:37.750 --> 28:39.917
you know, wherever we wind up.

28:39.919 --> 28:41.151
Great.

28:41.153 --> 28:43.020
Oh, that's for both of us.

28:43.956 --> 28:45.222
Hi.

30:27.526 --> 30:29.426
Mm.

30:29.428 --> 30:33.163
So, you were about to tell me
about the ticket girl you dated.

30:33.165 --> 30:34.498
Corin?

30:34.500 --> 30:38.502
Not really, sort of.
But not really.

30:38.504 --> 30:40.871
Seems like she likes you.

30:40.873 --> 30:42.306
No.

30:43.309 --> 30:45.042
We're just friends.

30:45.044 --> 30:47.044
You know, you don't have
to be weird about it.

30:47.046 --> 30:50.180
We all have exes.
It's a small town.

30:50.182 --> 30:53.116
I mean, I'm sure you know
most of the guys I've dated.

30:53.118 --> 30:56.153
Seth did say something
about one of the guys he knows.

30:56.155 --> 30:58.956
One of those complicated losers.

30:58.958 --> 31:00.457
That's why I like you, Jameson.

31:01.861 --> 31:03.460
You're not like those guys.

31:03.462 --> 31:05.495
I'm right here, okay?

31:05.497 --> 31:07.030
Titties!

31:07.032 --> 31:09.066
Is this the girl you were
telling me about?

31:09.068 --> 31:12.302
- Harmony, Andy.
- Oh, was he?

31:12.304 --> 31:16.540
She is
honorable woman

31:16.542 --> 31:20.143
with ethics and morals
I'm sure.

31:20.145 --> 31:22.546
What's up? She's hot.

31:22.548 --> 31:24.248
You're hot.
I'm just saying you're, like,

31:24.250 --> 31:26.650
much more attractive than,
like, he originally

31:26.652 --> 31:28.452
said when he was
talking about you.

31:28.454 --> 31:30.153
And he was talking
about you a lot.

31:30.155 --> 31:31.955
Thank you very much.

31:31.957 --> 31:36.393
Um, can we get
a new bass up here?

31:36.395 --> 31:39.029
We have a broken bass string.

31:39.031 --> 31:40.964
Partied a little too hard.

31:40.966 --> 31:42.332
Uh, Jameson? Jameson?

31:42.334 --> 31:44.001
Hey. Hey, Harmony.

31:44.003 --> 31:46.904
Hey, can we borrow
Taylor's bass?

31:46.906 --> 31:48.372
Please? Real quick?

31:48.374 --> 31:50.240
- He's outside.
- Yeah?

31:50.242 --> 31:52.442
- Thank you.
- All right, he's on it.

31:52.444 --> 31:53.644
You're amazing.

31:53.646 --> 31:56.179
Anyways, what's up?

31:56.181 --> 31:59.082
How's everyone doing?
Doing good?

31:59.084 --> 32:00.550
Love your tattoos. Awesome.

32:00.552 --> 32:03.220
So. Got a sister?

32:03.222 --> 32:04.655
- Yeah.
- Nice.

32:04.657 --> 32:06.089
You like babies?

32:07.559 --> 32:09.259
I've got it.

32:09.261 --> 32:14.197
- Hey, Caleb needs your bass.
- Okay.

32:14.199 --> 32:18.101
Did Jameson tell you
about the time I saved his life?

32:19.004 --> 32:20.604
No.

32:20.606 --> 32:24.141
We were in Patagonia,
and we rented a goat.

32:25.244 --> 32:27.210
He was on the side
of this cliff,

32:29.181 --> 32:30.614
and, um...

32:33.285 --> 32:35.719
It's a stupid story.

32:35.721 --> 32:37.587
I'll tell you about it
some other time.

32:37.589 --> 32:40.190
There he is! There's Taylor.

32:40.192 --> 32:41.358
Doesn't he look like Baby Thor?

32:41.360 --> 32:43.193
Look at this guy. He's so cute.

32:43.195 --> 32:46.563
Awesome, great. Okay.

32:46.565 --> 32:48.465
- Speaking of the devil.
- Speaking of the devil.

32:48.467 --> 32:51.301
All right. I'm gonna
give you your man back.

32:51.303 --> 32:55.138
After everything
I have done for him.

32:55.140 --> 32:57.307
We're ready to rock. Okay.

32:57.309 --> 33:03.146
So, this next song is dedicated
to our good friend, Jameson.

33:03.148 --> 33:05.482
It's just based off a bunch of
shit he said when he was drunk,

33:05.484 --> 33:07.351
and we wrote it into a song.

33:07.353 --> 33:11.488

Yeah. I mean, I have to.

36:40.748 --> 36:42.531
I mean, it's Jack.

38:06.818 --> 38:09.486
I would if I was in your class.

38:09.488 --> 38:12.656
I'm really glad you're not
in my class, Harmony.

38:12.658 --> 38:15.992
Honestly, I'm thinking about
doing something else next year.

38:15.994 --> 38:17.761
What about you?
Do you like your job?

38:17.763 --> 38:21.298
Yeah, it's cool,
but it's just retail.

38:21.300 --> 38:22.999
I mean,
I wanna do lots of things.

38:23.001 --> 38:25.969
Maybe move to L.A. or New York.

38:25.971 --> 38:28.672
I have a friend
who's a photographer.

38:28.674 --> 38:30.373
Sometimes I model for him.

38:30.375 --> 38:31.508
Cool.

38:31.510 --> 38:33.677
Like fashion stuff or--?

38:33.679 --> 38:36.880
Yeah. And, like,
art projects for his classes.

38:40.352 --> 38:42.052
Maybe I shouldn't
tell you this, but...

38:43.822 --> 38:45.588
I even did a nude shoot once.

38:46.525 --> 38:49.759
- It was very tasteful.
- Cool.

38:49.761 --> 38:51.761
My friend tried to sell
'em to this website,

38:51.763 --> 38:53.563
but there was
this really weird contract

38:53.565 --> 38:55.632
where they basically own you.

38:55.634 --> 38:58.368
In the end, I just didn't want
my biggest accomplishment

38:58.370 --> 39:00.437
to be showing my tits
on the Internet.

39:00.439 --> 39:01.638
Not that I'm ashamed of my body.

39:01.640 --> 39:03.073

39:04.543 --> 39:06.509
So not a pinup.

39:06.511 --> 39:07.711
What do you wanna do?

39:09.381 --> 39:11.047
I'm not really sure.

39:11.049 --> 39:14.017
I mean, I definitely don't wanna
work retail the rest of my life.

39:14.019 --> 39:16.986
Maybe I'll, I don't know,
take some classes

39:16.988 --> 39:19.956
at the community college
or something.

39:19.958 --> 39:22.892
Yeah, you should.
That's a great idea.

39:22.894 --> 39:24.661
Do you know
what you wanna study?

39:27.632 --> 39:30.734
I mean, just take one class,
see how it goes.

39:30.736 --> 39:33.570
Something fun
like art appreciation?

39:35.574 --> 39:36.840
Yeah.

39:38.944 --> 39:43.580
One question.
These tasteful nudes,

39:43.582 --> 39:44.848
how would I find them?

39:44.850 --> 39:46.750

have told you.

It's not a fun way to spend

49:35.640 --> 49:37.974
If you do, can you please
explain the point to me?

49:37.976 --> 49:39.642
The kids don't understand
what's going on,

49:39.644 --> 49:43.512

experience for the adults.

49:43.514 --> 49:45.247

you weren't

Hey, buddy, buddy.

50:34.098 --> 50:36.365

50:40.671 --> 50:42.772

50:42.774 --> 50:44.540

50:48.446 --> 50:50.346

- Lady.

50:51.349 --> 50:53.416
So, who's up next?

50:53.418 --> 50:55.418
The Savings Plan.

50:55.420 --> 50:57.086
Best thing that's
ever come outta here.

50:57.088 --> 50:58.387
They didn't
come outta here, Ricky.

50:58.389 --> 51:01.057

51:04.829 --> 51:07.496

51:07.498 --> 51:11.200
The Savings Plan is the greatest
thing that's ever happened here.

51:11.202 --> 51:12.568

51:12.570 --> 51:14.370

the first time

51:14.372 --> 51:16.205
I saw 'em
in the church basement.

51:16.207 --> 51:17.740
They should've been huge.

51:17.742 --> 51:19.742
The Plan was as good
as any other band like them,

51:19.744 --> 51:22.812
but they were great
'cause they didn't give a shit.

51:22.814 --> 51:25.081
You gotta convince everybody
how great you are

51:25.083 --> 51:26.549
just to believe it yourself.

51:26.551 --> 51:28.784
Does it even matter?

51:28.786 --> 51:31.120
Is this, like,
all you guys do?

51:31.122 --> 51:34.290
Sit around and talk about bands
nobody cares about?

51:34.292 --> 51:36.559
We have barbecues sometimes.

51:38.296 --> 51:39.695
You should come over.

51:40.798 --> 51:42.198
Don't.

57:54.071 --> 57:55.103
Wait, what?

57:55.105 --> 57:56.705
All right, young bloods.

57:56.707 --> 58:00.909
Be safe, have fun.
I'm off to the homestead.

58:04.482 --> 58:06.215
Vaya con Dios, Luke!

58:07.551 --> 58:10.519
There goes
a real hero of the faith.

58:10.521 --> 58:12.921
They want us out.
Go to LaSalles or go home.

58:12.923 --> 58:14.957
- You comin'?
- To the bar?

58:14.959 --> 58:19.495
- Yeah.
- Well, I'm not 21.

58:19.497 --> 58:21.964
It's fine. I've been going
to LaSalles since I was 16.

58:21.966 --> 58:25.167
You're goin'.
The night's not over yet.

58:25.169 --> 58:28.103
Hey, Taylor.
Take a picture with me.

58:29.940 --> 58:31.640
Come on, what are you doin'?

58:39.817 --> 58:41.817
Who's driving me to LaSalles?

58:44.121 --> 58:46.021
Okay, come on.

58:50.561 --> 58:52.694
Hey. You going out after this?

58:52.696 --> 58:56.064
It depends how long it takes
me to clean up this mess.

58:56.066 --> 58:59.735
Well, I'll be out,
wherever we wind up.

58:59.737 --> 59:03.238
- On your date?
- She went home.

59:03.240 --> 59:05.741
She's really cool though.
You'd like her.

59:05.743 --> 59:08.210
Yeah, okay. Well, don't get
too wild before I find you.

59:08.212 --> 59:13.749
I wanna talk to smart Jameson,
not drunk and emotional Jameson.

59:13.751 --> 59:15.117
It's a little embarrassing.

59:15.119 --> 59:18.120
Actually I am drunk,
emotional Jameson.

59:18.122 --> 59:20.289
Okay. Just remember, J,

59:20.291 --> 59:23.325
I like you better
when you're you.

59:32.703 --> 59:34.670
Mel? No, no. Can we--

59:34.672 --> 59:36.171
Can we please
not do this right now?

59:36.173 --> 59:38.240
Why can't you
just take me home?

59:38.242 --> 59:41.043
Let's just have one drink,
and I'll take you home afterwards.

59:41.045 --> 59:42.744
I don't wanna go out,
and I don't want you

59:42.746 --> 59:44.046
to stumble into
my room at 3:00 a.m.

59:44.048 --> 59:45.581
like it's a romantic gesture.

59:45.583 --> 59:47.049
Seriously,
you're gonna make me cry.

59:47.051 --> 59:48.817
And I fucking hate crying.

59:48.819 --> 59:51.186
- Seth, we are pregnant.
- I know.

59:51.188 --> 59:53.922
- And you're acting like everything is fine.
- I fucking know.

59:53.924 --> 59:55.624
I know nothing's fine,
all right?

59:55.626 --> 59:57.059
I'm not stupid.

59:57.061 --> 01:00:00.128
I just wanna go
to the bar with my friends

01:00:00.130 --> 01:00:02.864
and my band and have one drink.

01:00:02.866 --> 01:00:04.166
And I want you to be there.

01:00:04.168 --> 01:00:05.701
I don't see
what the big deal is.

01:00:05.703 --> 01:00:08.637
Okay. You do whatever
you wanna do.

01:00:12.376 --> 01:00:15.210
Rabbit, you wanna go to...
You wanna get a drink?

01:00:15.212 --> 01:00:16.945
I'm walking Lexi home.

01:00:18.649 --> 01:00:22.050

and I'm all alone ♪

01:00:22.052 --> 01:00:23.819

Is there a password
or something?

01:00:46.910 --> 01:00:49.411
Yeah, the emergency exit
alarm is broken.

01:00:49.413 --> 01:00:51.113
It's kind of a secret.

01:00:52.650 --> 01:00:54.149
It's good to be
out here though.

01:00:55.152 --> 01:00:57.219
In a dark alley?

01:00:57.221 --> 01:00:59.388
You should be more careful,
Taylor Peters.

01:00:59.390 --> 01:01:01.289
You could get jumped again.

01:01:01.291 --> 01:01:03.825
I mean, it's nice
to be out here with you.

01:01:08.899 --> 01:01:12.234
Oh, look, there's the guy
that you love that doesn't want you.

01:01:17.307 --> 01:01:20.442
- Have I told you that I'm single right now?
- Shit.

01:01:21.812 --> 01:01:23.278
Where are you goin'?

01:01:24.682 --> 01:01:26.114
I'll wait for you.

01:01:26.116 --> 01:01:27.449
What's up, gents?

01:01:27.451 --> 01:01:28.917
How's it going?

01:01:33.424 --> 01:01:35.724
So, I know you're bummed
about Corin,

01:01:35.726 --> 01:01:37.125
and I know she's nice, yeah,

01:01:37.127 --> 01:01:39.094
but she's always fucking
with your head, man.

01:01:39.096 --> 01:01:41.697
- I'm fine.
- It's not even that. It's...

01:01:44.401 --> 01:01:48.370
If you quit teaching and you piss away
your hard work for whatever reason,

01:01:48.372 --> 01:01:51.239
for Corin or
whatever bullshit reason, man,

01:01:51.241 --> 01:01:53.175
I'm gonna hit you with my car.

01:01:53.177 --> 01:01:55.077
You don't have a car, Seth.

01:01:57.214 --> 01:01:59.181
Dude, I'll fucking hit
you with your car.

01:02:00.417 --> 01:02:02.350
You gonna tell me
what's up with Mel?

01:02:04.888 --> 01:02:06.154
She's pregnant.

01:02:10.160 --> 01:02:11.727
How are you feeling?

01:02:14.898 --> 01:02:16.898
Well, man, I feel like...

01:02:19.803 --> 01:02:21.503
I feel like
no matter what we do,

01:02:22.439 --> 01:02:24.272
whether we keep
the baby or not...

01:02:26.343 --> 01:02:28.009
Yeah, chug that shit!

01:02:28.011 --> 01:02:29.845
It's like none of this
is gonna be the same.

01:02:29.847 --> 01:02:32.948
Chug, chug, chug, chug, chug!

01:02:34.017 --> 01:02:35.851
Man, you're drunk!

01:02:35.853 --> 01:02:37.986
Is it such a bad thing?

01:02:41.191 --> 01:02:42.491
Hey, Jameson.

01:02:42.493 --> 01:02:44.259
What's a girl gotta do
to get a pitcher

01:02:44.261 --> 01:02:46.862
of gin and tonic
around here, huh?

01:02:46.864 --> 01:02:48.964
Go be with her.

01:02:50.501 --> 01:02:52.434
What's good, amigo?

01:02:52.436 --> 01:02:55.337
Dude, I gotta get out of here
before I end up old and alone.

01:02:59.109 --> 01:03:00.842
- Like me?
- No, dude, you're cool.

01:03:00.844 --> 01:03:02.944
You got, like,
four different girlfriends.

01:03:02.946 --> 01:03:04.446
Sometimes.

01:03:09.019 --> 01:03:10.452
What's up, girl?

01:03:14.358 --> 01:03:18.026
Get outta here.
Go make love.

01:03:20.097 --> 01:03:22.397
But in the darkness,

01:03:22.399 --> 01:03:27.102
realize that
in the grips of love

01:03:27.104 --> 01:03:29.938
that you are
so close to death

01:03:29.940 --> 01:03:35.544
and that love is
the only bulwark against death.

01:03:43.587 --> 01:03:44.820
Keep an eye on our boy.

01:03:59.436 --> 01:04:01.002
I hate my life.

01:04:01.004 --> 01:04:02.437
- Bye.
- Bye, babe.

01:04:02.439 --> 01:04:04.105
She's not 21.

01:04:04.107 --> 01:04:06.141
She's wearing,
like, a shit brown skirt

01:04:06.143 --> 01:04:07.943
and a white top.

01:04:07.945 --> 01:04:09.444
Are you listening?

01:04:09.446 --> 01:04:12.147
- Point her out to me.
- Okay, look.

01:04:12.149 --> 01:04:14.149
I don't want her to know
I told on her, okay?

01:04:14.151 --> 01:04:16.318
I just don't think
it's cool for her to be here.

01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:19.855
All right. Shit brown skirt.
Not 21. I'll take care of it.

01:04:19.857 --> 01:04:22.224
Thank you. When?

01:04:22.226 --> 01:04:24.993
Sometime after you
stop bothering me.

01:04:31.268 --> 01:04:33.435
- Night, Rabbit.
- Yeah.

01:04:39.276 --> 01:04:41.309
Thanks for taking care
of me tonight.

01:04:47.384 --> 01:04:48.617
Good night, friend.

01:04:57.361 --> 01:05:00.328
Jack, you're acting like
we don't even know each other.

01:05:02.900 --> 01:05:04.299
That's kinda how it feels.

01:05:08.972 --> 01:05:10.906
Are you dating this guy?

01:05:10.908 --> 01:05:13.608
No. That's why I wanted
to talk to you.

01:05:17.681 --> 01:05:20.482
I mean, what happened?

01:05:22.052 --> 01:05:23.285
Did he...?

01:05:25.022 --> 01:05:26.621
No, it's not like that.

01:05:26.623 --> 01:05:28.123
I wanted it to happen.

01:05:28.125 --> 01:05:29.457
Okay? It was nice.

01:05:29.459 --> 01:05:32.394
Okay, I don't need
to hear all this.

01:05:32.396 --> 01:05:34.162
Jack, I'm just trying
to talk to you.

01:05:34.164 --> 01:05:37.966
I don't wanna hear about
how nicely this guy screws.

01:05:44.975 --> 01:05:48.710
I think I was wrong about
what was going on between us.

01:05:50.314 --> 01:05:51.546
No.

01:05:53.050 --> 01:05:54.316
I think I was.

01:05:56.453 --> 01:05:58.720
I was wrong
about how I felt about you.

01:06:01.425 --> 01:06:04.125
But I'm not gonna beat
myself up about it, okay?

01:06:04.127 --> 01:06:05.493
It happened.

01:06:06.730 --> 01:06:08.330
But it should have been...

01:06:09.700 --> 01:06:11.733
us

01:06:11.735 --> 01:06:13.568
together for the first time.

01:06:16.406 --> 01:06:17.605
What does that mean?

01:06:19.443 --> 01:06:21.676
It means I wanna be with you.

01:06:21.678 --> 01:06:25.380
If you can accept the fact
that I'm not perfect and...

01:06:25.382 --> 01:06:28.683
Well, if you still
wanna be with me, so...

01:06:58.281 --> 01:07:01.082
Wait, stop, stop. Hold on.

01:07:01.084 --> 01:07:02.584
Let's just slow down.

01:07:04.621 --> 01:07:07.122
You said you wanted it
to be me.

01:07:08.759 --> 01:07:10.792
I know I did.
And I do.

01:07:10.794 --> 01:07:13.495
Look, I'm here.

01:07:13.497 --> 01:07:15.597
And I just told you how I feel.

01:07:19.436 --> 01:07:22.203
But this is
all new territory for me.

01:07:22.205 --> 01:07:25.240
So maybe tomorrow,
or the next day,

01:07:25.242 --> 01:07:27.075
or the day after that,

01:07:28.278 --> 01:07:29.544
we'll see how it goes.

01:07:29.546 --> 01:07:32.647
But not here.
Not in my kitchen.

01:07:34.384 --> 01:07:37.452
And not until
after you've thought about it.

01:07:38.822 --> 01:07:41.089
You know,
put a little effort into it.

01:07:43.460 --> 01:07:44.659
Okay.

01:07:49.533 --> 01:07:51.099
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

01:07:57.641 --> 01:07:59.307
Okay, good night.

01:08:15.659 --> 01:08:17.425
We look like
a depressing version

01:08:17.426 --> 01:08:20.261
of a Norman Rockwell painting.

01:08:22.631 --> 01:08:24.466
You okay?

01:08:24.468 --> 01:08:27.268
I'm just--

01:08:27.270 --> 01:08:29.504
I can't wait to move
to New York next year.

01:08:29.506 --> 01:08:34.109
Yeah, I hear life in New York
is really easy and convenient.

01:08:34.111 --> 01:08:37.879
I'm tired of this town, Jameson,

01:08:37.881 --> 01:08:39.546
and all the pathetic shit
that goes on.

01:08:44.154 --> 01:08:45.653
Hey, you mind walking me home?

01:08:46.790 --> 01:08:48.323
Not at all.

01:08:50.127 --> 01:08:52.827
I'm gonna go hit the head,
tell Andy I'm leaving.

01:08:52.828 --> 01:08:56.631
Well, I'll be here
with this bucket of gin.

01:09:00.670 --> 01:09:02.303
All right, come on.

01:09:07.477 --> 01:09:11.145
- I wish we'd met before today.
- We did.

01:09:11.148 --> 01:09:13.214
You know what I mean,
I mean like this.

01:09:18.921 --> 01:09:20.889
- You wanna know something funny?
- What?

01:09:21.791 --> 01:09:23.791
- Actually, never mind.
- What?

01:09:23.792 --> 01:09:25.493
No, never mind.

01:09:25.495 --> 01:09:27.162
No, what is it? Tell me.

01:09:27.163 --> 01:09:28.930
- Tell me.
- It's embarrassing.

01:09:28.932 --> 01:09:31.399
Well, embarrassing for you
or embarrassing for me?

01:09:31.401 --> 01:09:34.801
- For me.
- Well, then, you gotta tell me.

01:09:37.474 --> 01:09:39.941
You were the first boy
I had a crush on.

01:09:41.178 --> 01:09:43.411
Really?

01:09:43.412 --> 01:09:45.212
Ha ha! Yeah.

01:09:46.649 --> 01:09:49.317
You'd come over
to my brother's to play music,

01:09:49.319 --> 01:09:53.421
and I'd get so mad
'cause he wouldn't let me watch.

01:09:53.423 --> 01:09:56.691
I mean, we were just playing
really bad covers of Ramones songs,

01:09:56.693 --> 01:09:59.227
so I don't think
you were missing very much.

01:10:01.765 --> 01:10:04.832
Yeah, I know.
I listened from my room.

01:10:13.810 --> 01:10:15.810
Handy Andy.

01:10:15.812 --> 01:10:17.312
I'm gonna go walk Corin home.

01:10:17.314 --> 01:10:19.247
Gonna be here for a while?

01:10:19.249 --> 01:10:21.316
Yeah, a few more.

01:10:21.318 --> 01:10:22.684
I'll catch you at the house.

01:10:22.686 --> 01:10:24.686
All right.
Watch out, you old romantic.

01:10:24.688 --> 01:10:27.288
I know how moonbeams
and gin get to you.

01:10:27.290 --> 01:10:29.857
Don't worry about me.
I'm a big boy.

01:10:29.859 --> 01:10:32.727
It's a mother's job to worry.

01:10:32.729 --> 01:10:35.296
- Milady.
- Thanks.

01:10:37.567 --> 01:10:39.867
Hey, let me see your I.D.?

01:10:39.869 --> 01:10:41.603
- Oh, um...
- Is there a problem?

01:10:41.605 --> 01:10:43.404
Uh, I must have dropped it.

01:10:43.406 --> 01:10:44.672
If you don't have an I.D.,

01:10:44.674 --> 01:10:46.541
I don't know
how you got in here.

01:10:46.543 --> 01:10:48.710
It's all right, she's with me.

01:10:48.712 --> 01:10:52.280
You and your high school girlfriend
are leaving before I call the cops.

01:10:54.918 --> 01:10:56.451
Wanna get out of here?

01:10:57.754 --> 01:11:00.955
Yeah, it's...
it's kinda dead, right?

01:11:00.957 --> 01:11:03.791
Yeah. Yeah, I think so.
Come on.

01:11:05.729 --> 01:11:07.895
- I'm so sorry.
- No, it's fine.

01:11:07.897 --> 01:11:10.632
I'm so sick of this shit.

01:11:15.972 --> 01:11:18.640
Thanks for walking me home.

01:11:18.642 --> 01:11:20.475
Of course.

01:11:20.477 --> 01:11:22.510
It's finally starting
to cool down.

01:11:24.881 --> 01:11:27.015
You said you wanted to talk.

01:11:28.718 --> 01:11:30.418
What did you wanna talk about?

01:11:33.923 --> 01:11:36.591
Why'd you get drunk
at my birthday party,

01:11:38.028 --> 01:11:39.494
say all that stuff?

01:11:43.933 --> 01:11:47.635
It was nice how this was,

01:11:47.637 --> 01:11:48.903
being friends.

01:11:50.707 --> 01:11:52.040
Why'd you...

01:11:53.076 --> 01:11:54.942
mess it up?

01:11:54.944 --> 01:11:57.312
I didn't realize
I was messing anything up

01:11:57.314 --> 01:12:00.014
by telling you how I feel.

01:12:00.016 --> 01:12:01.616
Okay.

01:12:03.420 --> 01:12:04.986
You just don't like hearing it.

01:12:07.757 --> 01:12:09.324
I mean, I'm--

01:12:09.326 --> 01:12:11.025
I'm not gonna argue
with you, Jameson.

01:12:12.862 --> 01:12:16.397
But I think
if we were in a real city,

01:12:16.399 --> 01:12:17.965
you'd be over this by now.

01:12:23.340 --> 01:12:25.640
It's been
such a strange summer.

01:12:27.711 --> 01:12:32.080
Ugly, smoky days
and pretty nights.

01:12:32.082 --> 01:12:34.982
- Corin--
- You know what, Jameson, it's--

01:12:34.984 --> 01:12:37.085
it's getting late,
I should get to bed.

01:12:37.087 --> 01:12:40.355
Let's... Let's not do
this tonight, okay?

01:12:40.357 --> 01:12:42.357
But you're
always hiding from me.

01:12:42.359 --> 01:12:44.892
Just tell me what you want.

01:12:48.998 --> 01:12:50.498
I...

01:12:52.702 --> 01:12:55.370
I still don't know what to say.

01:13:01.478 --> 01:13:05.113
Look, J, like,
you can go anywhere.

01:13:05.115 --> 01:13:06.848
You can do anything.

01:13:06.850 --> 01:13:09.150
You have all these plans
and dreams for your life,

01:13:09.152 --> 01:13:12.086
and none of them include hanging
around your deadbeat friends

01:13:12.088 --> 01:13:15.623
- and drinking beer.
- Corin, I mean, I'm alive,

01:13:15.625 --> 01:13:18.559
and I'm sitting here
on this porch swing with you.

01:13:19.863 --> 01:13:22.497
And I don't think it gets
any better than this...

01:13:25.001 --> 01:13:26.401
you know.

01:13:30.673 --> 01:13:32.440
I'm sorry, Jameson.

01:13:35.445 --> 01:13:36.944
I've been such a bitch.

01:13:38.415 --> 01:13:40.181
And you're so sweet and...

01:13:42.085 --> 01:13:43.518
I just...

01:13:46.055 --> 01:13:47.455
I don't know why I...

01:13:49.526 --> 01:13:50.892
I can't do this.

01:13:54.764 --> 01:13:56.497
'Cause you don't want to.

01:14:00.203 --> 01:14:02.670
I have this...

01:14:03.706 --> 01:14:05.807
idea in my head of

01:14:05.809 --> 01:14:08.142
what I want my life
to be like and

01:14:08.144 --> 01:14:11.712
what it should be like,
and then you just keep...

01:14:14.517 --> 01:14:15.750
messing it up.

01:14:21.591 --> 01:14:22.890
Good night, Corin.

01:14:42.912 --> 01:14:46.914
You know, I have lived
in this town all my life,

01:14:46.916 --> 01:14:49.183
and I have never gone
night swimming.

01:14:50.653 --> 01:14:51.986
You wanna go in?

01:14:51.988 --> 01:14:54.522
Oh, I'm not
skinny-dipping, sorry.

01:14:54.524 --> 01:14:56.557
Well, that's fine, good.
I'm incredibly modest.

01:14:56.559 --> 01:14:57.792
Just dive in.

01:15:00.697 --> 01:15:02.930
Uh, I don't wanna get
my clothes wet.

01:15:06.503 --> 01:15:09.070
But I, uh...
But I do wanna go swimming.

01:15:12.675 --> 01:15:14.642
- Is it cold?
- Well, certainly.

01:15:21.718 --> 01:15:23.618
Are you gonna check the water?

01:15:23.620 --> 01:15:24.619
Nope.

01:15:29.626 --> 01:15:31.859
Oh!

01:15:31.861 --> 01:15:34.028
- How is it?
- It's perfect.

01:15:34.998 --> 01:15:36.697
Oh, god.

01:15:38.835 --> 01:15:40.234
My pants came off.

01:15:46.676 --> 01:15:48.776
Come on.

01:15:48.778 --> 01:15:51.012
- Turn around?
- Why? It's dark.

01:15:52.048 --> 01:15:53.648
I'm-- I'm shy.

01:16:08.131 --> 01:16:09.931
Oh! It's freezing!

01:16:09.933 --> 01:16:12.233
Oh! Oh, my god!

01:16:12.235 --> 01:16:14.268
It's fed by the river.
It's always cold.

01:16:14.270 --> 01:16:17.071
Oh!

01:16:24.914 --> 01:16:27.715
- I think it's refreshing.
- Then go back in!

01:16:28.918 --> 01:16:30.718
No! No!

01:16:30.720 --> 01:16:32.954
No! No!

01:17:05.655 --> 01:17:08.022
Oh, my god, no! No!

01:17:16.833 --> 01:17:18.833
Hey!
You've reached Mel. You can--

01:17:28.411 --> 01:17:29.810
Oh!

01:17:32.048 --> 01:17:33.247
Seth.

01:17:34.317 --> 01:17:35.816
Hey.

01:17:54.003 --> 01:17:55.703
How was the bar?

01:17:56.673 --> 01:17:58.105
It was all right.

01:18:02.445 --> 01:18:03.878
Mel, I was--

01:18:03.880 --> 01:18:05.880
I was not
a good boyfriend today.

01:18:07.383 --> 01:18:08.849
Yeah.

01:18:14.123 --> 01:18:15.956
Was that meant to be an apology?

01:18:18.728 --> 01:18:20.227
Yeah.

01:18:21.264 --> 01:18:22.963
It wasn't a very good one.

01:18:24.167 --> 01:18:26.367
I'm sorry.

01:18:26.369 --> 01:18:28.069
Like, all I wanted
to do tonight

01:18:28.071 --> 01:18:30.337
was just, like,
drink myself silly, but...

01:18:31.474 --> 01:18:33.874
but Mel I love you, so I'm here.

01:18:39.949 --> 01:18:41.215
But, like, if you, um...

01:18:43.119 --> 01:18:44.719
Fuck.

01:18:44.721 --> 01:18:46.487
If you're not, like, ready
to talk about it

01:18:46.489 --> 01:18:48.289
or if, like,
you're too tired,

01:18:49.759 --> 01:18:53.127
I get it.
So I'll just, I'll, uh...

01:18:56.499 --> 01:18:57.898
Seth.

01:19:03.740 --> 01:19:05.906
Just take your shoes off.

01:19:38.007 --> 01:19:39.874
You gotta stop being a dickhead.

01:19:41.077 --> 01:19:42.376
It's genetic.

01:19:43.846 --> 01:19:46.847
Dad's a dickhead.
Grandpa's a dickhead.

01:19:47.817 --> 01:19:49.250
There's no hope for me.

01:19:55.224 --> 01:19:56.791
So...

01:19:56.793 --> 01:19:58.359
So you're saying
if we have this kid,

01:19:58.361 --> 01:20:01.262
it's just automatically gonna
pop out a dickhead?

01:20:01.264 --> 01:20:03.297
- Little baby dickhead.
- Awesome.

01:20:09.071 --> 01:20:11.472
I mean, that or

01:20:11.474 --> 01:20:14.909
it adopts your, uh...
your dad's bad hair

01:20:14.911 --> 01:20:19.146
and Orange County
fascist tendencies.

01:20:20.850 --> 01:20:22.183
My dad.

01:20:28.524 --> 01:20:30.457
I wouldn't be like him,
you know.

01:20:37.233 --> 01:20:38.432
I know.

01:20:44.207 --> 01:20:45.539
Can I say something?

01:20:46.609 --> 01:20:48.309
Yeah.

01:20:48.311 --> 01:20:49.476
I, um...

01:20:53.216 --> 01:20:54.615
I'm gonna get a better job.

01:20:57.353 --> 01:20:58.986
You can stay in school.

01:21:01.357 --> 01:21:02.890
And then after...

01:21:04.060 --> 01:21:07.862
I'll stay at home
and you can work.

01:21:14.370 --> 01:21:15.886
'Cause, um...

01:21:15.887 --> 01:21:17.403
Oh, man, no, I think
we need to have this baby.

01:22:54.070 --> 01:22:57.071
being an irresistible
guy like me.

01:22:58.140 --> 01:22:59.440
You taking her home?

01:23:00.343 --> 01:23:01.542
Ohh.

01:23:02.578 --> 01:23:04.378
She's got her kid tomorrow.

- So, no.

01:23:08.384 --> 01:23:12.252
- Okay. You hungry?
- Yeah.

01:23:13.389 --> 01:23:15.055
Let's go down to the diner

01:23:15.057 --> 01:23:17.725
and see if our
favorite waitress is working.

01:23:17.727 --> 01:23:20.527
Uh-huh. Sweet Maria.

01:23:20.529 --> 01:23:23.063
Your words
are the breath of spring.

01:23:23.065 --> 01:23:25.766
Your bosom
the promise of heaven.

01:23:45.488 --> 01:23:47.488
Food finally killed someone.

01:23:49.158 --> 01:23:50.591
Real funny, Rabbit.

01:23:57.233 --> 01:23:59.299
I'm going back
to the house. I'm tired.

01:23:59.301 --> 01:24:01.702
Absolutely not.

01:24:03.172 --> 01:24:08.142
We still got things
to drink about, talk about.

01:24:08.144 --> 01:24:10.077
I wanna hear
what sexy Lexi had to say.

01:24:10.079 --> 01:24:11.545
No way.

01:24:11.547 --> 01:24:14.181
Don't run away, bunny rabbit!

01:24:14.183 --> 01:24:15.549
We know you have feelings.

01:24:15.551 --> 01:24:17.451
We're gonna get
those feelings.

01:24:17.453 --> 01:24:19.219
Bullshit, I'm going to bed.

01:24:19.221 --> 01:24:20.721
You can talk about my feelings.

01:24:20.723 --> 01:24:22.523
Take us to Caleb's.
Caleb has beer!

01:24:22.525 --> 01:24:24.391
Caleb's got beer!

01:24:24.393 --> 01:24:26.193
I don't think Caleb's home.

01:24:26.195 --> 01:24:28.162
Really? There's a fire.

01:24:30.766 --> 01:24:32.566
Oh! Oh!

01:24:32.568 --> 01:24:34.435
You're such a dick.

01:24:36.338 --> 01:24:37.538
Asshole.

01:24:37.540 --> 01:24:39.673
Come on. Come on, bud.

01:24:39.675 --> 01:24:41.308
You okay, Rabbit?

01:24:41.310 --> 01:24:43.677
No, man, he's not home.

01:24:43.679 --> 01:24:46.313
Beer, beer, beer.

01:24:46.315 --> 01:24:47.848
Beer.

01:24:47.850 --> 01:24:49.283
Give me one of those.

01:24:49.285 --> 01:24:51.318
- Yes.
- At last.

01:25:05.668 --> 01:25:08.102
- Oh, good god!
- Fuck.

01:25:16.679 --> 01:25:19.113
- What are you guys doing here?
- Good morning, Caleb.

01:25:19.115 --> 01:25:20.881
We're hanging out.

01:25:20.883 --> 01:25:22.850
Well, hand me a beer
if you guys are gonna stay.

01:25:22.852 --> 01:25:25.152
- Yes!
- Sneaky bastards.

01:25:25.154 --> 01:25:26.453
Get the man a beer!

01:25:27.590 --> 01:25:29.823
I gotta do
everything around here?

01:25:29.825 --> 01:25:31.558
Where's my shirt?

01:25:32.828 --> 01:25:34.428
Where's my shirt?

01:25:36.565 --> 01:25:39.500
Now we got
a hootenanny, boys.

01:25:39.502 --> 01:25:41.768
What are you doing
out here, Caleb?

01:25:41.770 --> 01:25:45.339
Dude, it was too hot
in my room to sleep.

01:25:45.341 --> 01:25:47.207
That's 'cause you live
in a woodshed.

01:25:47.209 --> 01:25:48.809
What are you doing here?

01:25:48.811 --> 01:25:52.212
- Rabbit and Lexi had a conversation.
- No shit?

01:25:52.214 --> 01:25:53.514
And we need to hear about it.

01:25:53.516 --> 01:25:54.915
What happened with Lexi?

01:25:54.917 --> 01:25:58.152
Uh, we talked.

01:25:58.154 --> 01:25:59.319
We made out for a second.

01:25:59.321 --> 01:26:00.721
Ha! Yeah!

01:26:00.723 --> 01:26:01.922
Yes! Yes!

01:26:01.924 --> 01:26:03.590
I think it's gonna work out.

01:26:03.592 --> 01:26:05.692
I honestly thought
that you were

01:26:05.694 --> 01:26:07.427
sexually dyslexic
for a while.

01:26:07.429 --> 01:26:09.196
Fuck you.

01:26:09.198 --> 01:26:11.899
- How was your night, Jameson?
- J-boy.

01:26:13.235 --> 01:26:14.835
I went to see about Corin.

01:26:14.837 --> 01:26:16.537
It's not gonna work out though.

01:26:16.539 --> 01:26:19.439
I can't sit around
waiting for her,

01:26:19.441 --> 01:26:20.874
being a sad sack.

01:26:20.876 --> 01:26:23.410
I gotta do something
with my fucking life.

01:26:23.412 --> 01:26:25.879
Can't hang out
with you assholes forever.

01:26:25.881 --> 01:26:27.381
The end...

01:26:28.951 --> 01:26:30.584
of a pathetic...

01:26:31.787 --> 01:26:33.353
depressing era.

01:26:34.356 --> 01:26:36.323
- You gonna hit up Harmony?
- Yes!

01:26:36.325 --> 01:26:38.258
- There we go, okay!
- I am.

01:26:38.260 --> 01:26:39.593
Right on!

01:26:39.595 --> 01:26:43.397
Well, sounds like
a productive day for all.

01:26:44.600 --> 01:26:45.899
I love you guys.

01:26:49.271 --> 01:26:51.438
And I got
an announcement to make.

01:26:51.440 --> 01:26:52.673
Here we go again.

01:26:52.675 --> 01:26:54.675
I'm gonna go on an adventure.

01:26:55.978 --> 01:26:57.578
I'm gonna go off
on an adventure.

01:26:57.580 --> 01:26:59.813
Heard you
the first time, Andy.

01:26:59.815 --> 01:27:01.415
To find myself.

01:27:03.953 --> 01:27:07.287
And I'm gonna find myself.

01:27:07.289 --> 01:27:09.623
- I'm gonna hike.
- Chug these beers. Come on, let's go.

01:27:09.625 --> 01:27:11.325
Stand up, stand up, stand up.

01:27:11.327 --> 01:27:12.659
- House rules.
- You ruined it, man.

01:27:12.661 --> 01:27:14.294
I was just giving
an amazing speech.

01:27:14.296 --> 01:27:15.762
Three, two, one, go.
Go, go, go!

01:27:15.764 --> 01:27:18.532
I was saying something
really profound there,

01:27:18.534 --> 01:27:21.435
and this asshole
just interrupted me.

01:27:21.437 --> 01:27:23.537
Cheers, you sluts.

01:27:24.540 --> 01:27:25.706
Yeah!

01:27:25.708 --> 01:27:27.541
I don't feel too good.

01:27:29.411 --> 01:27:30.611
Ow, my tummy.

01:27:30.613 --> 01:27:32.779
I gotta stop drinking.

01:28:09.785 --> 01:28:11.485

of espresso in mine?

01:29:01.503 --> 01:29:04.037
Iced coffee for me,
with espresso.
