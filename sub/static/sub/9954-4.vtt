Pre vious/y on "Ha ven". ..

00:03.337 --> 00:05.202
I know that picture ——
Colorado Kid murderer.

00:05.339 --> 00:06.249
She looks like you.

00:06.382 --> 00:08.589
You know, you always come back
with a different name,

00:08.718 --> 00:10.709
but underneath,
you're always somehow the same.

00:10.845 --> 00:14.337
The first time I felt your touch
was the day you kissed me here.

00:14.473 --> 00:16.134
It was such a small thing for you.

00:16.267 --> 00:20.135
But for me, I hadn't felt anything
for a long time.

00:21.272 --> 00:21.897
Hello, Nathan.

00:22.023 --> 00:22.728
lf Audrey Parker is dead,

00:22.857 --> 00:24.768
a lot of people will be out
for Nathan's head.

00:24.901 --> 00:26.732
I don't know if I can stand in there
with you.

00:26.861 --> 00:28.817
You could kill me,
get your revenge,

00:28.946 --> 00:30.447
get to live the rest of your life
troubled,

00:30.573 --> 00:32.188
or you can let me live.

00:32.325 --> 00:34.862
I will find Audrey.
l'll convince her to kill me.

00:34.994 --> 00:36.200
The troubles will end forever.

00:36.329 --> 00:38.490
What is this place?
Am I dead?

00:38.623 --> 00:39.988
You're very much alive.

00:40.124 --> 00:42.365
But this place, these people...

00:42.501 --> 00:44.537
AUDREY: They're not real.

00:44.670 --> 00:46.501
—I heard Audrey's voice again.
—What'd you hear?

00:46.631 --> 00:50.340
She was talking about being trapped
inside a place that wasn't real.

00:50.468 --> 00:52.254
So you think Audrey
is still in the barn

00:52.386 --> 00:54.297
and it's still imploding?

00:55.348 --> 01:00.593
lt's dying, and unless we move fast,
it's gonna take you with it.

01:04.982 --> 01:07.724
And I rest my sleepy head

01:07.860 --> 01:10.647
upon my soft and cozy bed.

01:10.780 --> 01:13.738
I pray the Lord to keep me safe

01:13.866 --> 01:16.699
and watch me close until I wake.

01:16.827 --> 01:18.328
I love you, Harper.

01:19.372 --> 01:21.237
Sleep tight.

01:29.715 --> 01:34.800
[Giggling]

01:39.016 --> 01:40.472
Did you make that laugh?

01:40.601 --> 01:42.683
No, it was my friend.

01:43.354 --> 01:46.437
Was it Bella or Oscar the Cat?

01:46.565 --> 01:48.396
No, it was a new one.

01:48.526 --> 01:52.235
Well, tell your imaginary friend
it's time to go to sleep.

01:59.704 --> 02:04.368
[Giggling]

02:07.086 --> 02:09.452
Let's play a game.

02:23.894 --> 02:25.759
Bye—bye.

02:31.444 --> 02:33.605
Rise and shine, Harper.

02:34.071 --> 02:35.607
Harper?

02:35.740 --> 02:38.277
Oh, my God.
Harper!

02:38.409 --> 02:42.322
I went in this morning to wake her,
and she was gone.

02:42.455 --> 02:44.571
Whoever took her
had an awful laugh.

02:44.707 --> 02:46.618
Harper said that it was just
her imaginary friend,

02:46.751 --> 02:48.161
but there had to be
someone else in there.

02:48.294 --> 02:50.000
Are you sure someone
entered the house?

02:50.129 --> 02:52.666
Do you know anything
about little girls, Chief?

02:52.798 --> 02:54.914
A little.

02:55.051 --> 02:59.511
Then you know no four—year—old
could have done that.

02:59.638 --> 03:03.472
The kidnapper built that
and then pulled her up the vent.

03:15.363 --> 03:17.649
She must have used this
to open the grate.

03:17.782 --> 03:19.067
What are you talking about?

03:19.200 --> 03:21.532
We don't think
there was an intruder, ma'am.

03:21.660 --> 03:23.912
Your windows and doors
dead—bolt from the inside.

03:24.038 --> 03:25.198
No one got in here to take her.

03:25.331 --> 03:27.697
Harper couldn't have done this.

03:27.833 --> 03:29.994
Ma'am, some people
have special abilities

03:30.127 --> 03:31.207
that they can't control.

03:31.337 --> 03:33.703
That make them do things
they can't normally do.

03:33.839 --> 03:36.296
You're talking about the troubles.

03:36.425 --> 03:38.666
We don't have those in our family.

03:38.803 --> 03:41.169
Do you have some recent photos
of Harper?

03:45.267 --> 03:46.723
A troubled four—year—old?

03:46.852 --> 03:48.558
Yeah, I know.

03:50.689 --> 03:53.351
We need Audrey back now.

03:53.484 --> 03:55.395
All right, William...

03:55.528 --> 03:57.735
What is this barn
that I'm supposedly in?

03:57.863 --> 04:00.445
lt's —— it's a space
between two worlds,

04:00.574 --> 04:01.825
and it's been badly damaged.

04:01.951 --> 04:04.237
If you don't leave soon,
you will die.

04:04.370 --> 04:05.735
You know what?
That's easy for you to say,

04:05.871 --> 04:07.122
'cause the last time
I tried to leave,

04:07.248 --> 04:09.239
| just walked out that door
and came straight back in.

04:09.375 --> 04:11.866
You have to find the real door,
the door that leads back to Haven.

04:12.002 --> 04:12.866
Mm.

04:13.629 --> 04:16.245
Why don't you just tell me
where that is?

04:17.508 --> 04:19.248
I can't.

04:20.136 --> 04:22.502
The barn was built for you.

04:22.638 --> 04:24.629
Only you can see through this.

04:24.765 --> 04:26.676
You know what I don't get?

04:26.809 --> 04:29.972
I don't get why everybody else
disappeared and you didn't.

04:32.481 --> 04:34.017
Who are you, William?

04:34.150 --> 04:36.937
| wish I could tell you...

04:37.069 --> 04:38.058
but I can't.

04:38.195 --> 04:41.437
Right now I'm only allowed
to help you.

04:43.284 --> 04:47.994
So, do you want to see the truth?

04:52.209 --> 04:53.995
Yes.

04:54.128 --> 04:56.210
Okay.

04:56.338 --> 04:58.124
Close your eyes.
Take a deep breath.

04:59.008 --> 05:00.589
Close your eyes.

05:00.718 --> 05:03.209
Clear your mind of all expectations

05:03.345 --> 05:06.508
and tell yourself
when you open your eyes,

05:06.640 --> 05:08.972
your mind will open,

05:09.810 --> 05:13.723
and the truth will appear before you.

05:20.112 --> 05:21.022
Oh, my God.

05:22.907 --> 05:23.942
What's happening?

05:24.074 --> 05:26.611
Now you can see it.
The barn is dying.

05:26.744 --> 05:28.280
We're in its final moments.

05:28.412 --> 05:30.619
What if I can't find this door?

05:30.748 --> 05:33.956
You will cease to exist.

05:34.084 --> 05:36.336
[ Echoing ]
You will cease to exist.

05:37.796 --> 05:39.832
Audrey.

05:40.591 --> 05:45.085
[Somber folk music]

06:14.291 --> 06:16.373
I hate this place.

06:16.919 --> 06:18.500
The barn crumpled to nothing.

06:18.629 --> 06:20.415
How can Audrey still be inside?

06:21.257 --> 06:22.463
The time—traveling barn

06:22.591 --> 06:24.832
that turned ten seconds
into six months for me?

06:24.969 --> 06:26.084
That barn?

06:27.596 --> 06:30.212
So there's a door?
There's a way for Audrey to get out?

06:30.975 --> 06:32.340
That's what Jennifer heard,

06:32.476 --> 06:35.013
but her connection wasn't great.

06:35.145 --> 06:37.807
I thought she might do better
out here.

06:37.940 --> 06:40.682
The place
where we last saw the barn.

06:41.485 --> 06:42.850
You landed in Boston.

06:42.987 --> 06:45.353
Audrey could come out
of that barn anywhere.

06:45.489 --> 06:47.229
Yeah, let's hope.

06:50.369 --> 06:52.826
Jennifer said

06:52.955 --> 06:54.820
if Audrey
doesn't come out that door...

06:56.041 --> 06:57.247
...she dies.

—Nothing.

07:06.010 --> 07:07.295
Well, I need her. | ——

07:07.428 --> 07:08.838
What are you doing?

07:08.971 --> 07:10.711
You are freaking her out.

[Cell phone rings]

07:20.316 --> 07:21.351
Yeah.

07:23.110 --> 07:24.316
Sorry. I'm not good with pressure.

07:24.445 --> 07:26.481
I know.
Look, you're doing great.

07:26.614 --> 07:29.902
Just try to keep listening.

07:30.034 --> 07:33.242
Yeah, to the magic invisible barn.

07:33.370 --> 07:35.827
Okay.

07:35.956 --> 07:37.617
It's okay.

07:41.420 --> 07:42.580
What?

07:42.713 --> 07:45.250
That was Dwight.

07:45.382 --> 07:47.919
A second kid's gone missing,
another four—year—old.

07:48.052 --> 07:51.385
But Audrey could walk out here
at any second.

07:51.513 --> 07:54.926
Usually when Jennifer hears Audrey,
she's been relaxed.

07:55.059 --> 07:58.176
Now, getting her to relax
is something that you suck at.

07:59.438 --> 08:01.178
But what don't you suck at?

08:03.651 --> 08:05.937
Solving cases, finding people.

08:06.070 --> 08:07.651
Exactly.

08:07.780 --> 08:11.614
So you go find the kids.
I will get her to calm down.

08:11.742 --> 08:14.734
We will find Audrey,
and we'll all live happ--

08:17.247 --> 08:18.453
You know what I mean.

08:20.417 --> 08:21.918

08:25.673 --> 08:27.413
And breathe in.

08:27.549 --> 08:29.460
[lnhales deeply]

08:30.094 --> 08:33.427
And breathe out.

08:34.306 --> 08:38.140
Yoga is about the mind
controlling the body.

08:38.268 --> 08:40.645
That's why we don't feel the cold
right now.

08:40.771 --> 08:43.057
But do you really think
this is gonna help me hear things?

08:43.190 --> 08:45.351
Absolutely.

08:45.484 --> 08:50.353
You see, by focusing on your breath,
you can do anything.

08:58.956 --> 09:00.321

This is really starting

Second victim is Kent Tobel.

09:17.683 --> 09:19.344
Shopping with his dad
out at Lambert's,

09:19.476 --> 09:23.344
then he snuck back
in the stock room and built this.

09:24.523 --> 09:25.979
Climbed it to reach a key on a hook.

09:26.108 --> 09:29.020
Used the key to disarm
the emergency—door alarm.

09:29.153 --> 09:32.065
Another elaborate escape plan
for a kid barely out of diapers.

09:32.197 --> 09:33.778
Could Harper and Kent
maybe have the same

09:33.907 --> 09:35.317
"imaginary friend" trouble?

09:35.451 --> 09:39.660
They're not related, but they both
go to Sunnyside Preschool.

09:39.788 --> 09:42.325
That's where my daughter
Lizzie went.

09:43.333 --> 09:45.540
I bet you were a great dad.

09:45.669 --> 09:48.752
I didn't fit in the tiny desks
for parent—teacher day too well.

09:50.507 --> 09:52.919
You fit pretty good in mine.

09:53.051 --> 09:54.882
You're a good chief, Dwight.

09:55.012 --> 09:56.377
Thanks.

to the stock room and the rear exit.

It's like the laugh
cast a spell on him.

Once he hears it,
he can't help but follow.

10:27.377 --> 10:29.163
But where is it coming from?

10:29.296 --> 10:31.002
Hey, can you go back?

10:31.131 --> 10:33.622
I thought I caught a glimpse
of whoever's behind that door.

10:34.802 --> 10:36.793
What'd he look like?

I don't know ——
small, like a kid, but...

10:39.640 --> 10:41.380
Hang on. Zoom in.

10:42.392 --> 10:44.644
Move it to the left.

10:48.565 --> 10:51.898
Wow. I don't think
that kid goes to Sunnyside.

10:59.701 --> 11:03.410
Okay, now, some of this.

[Sighs]

11:11.964 --> 11:14.421

Here.

11:15.717 --> 11:20.381
The idea is to allow your mind
to be as empty as the bowl.

11:21.223 --> 11:23.555
Now, close your eyes...

11:25.394 --> 11:28.306
...and take a deep breath in.

That's good.
Okay, that's a good sign.

11:39.324 --> 11:40.404
That means someone's
looking for you.

11:40.534 --> 11:42.149
Who would be looking for me?

11:42.286 --> 11:46.996
You're more important than you know,
and your friends need you.

11:48.125 --> 11:49.865

We think this 10—year—old boy
is kidnapping the missing children.

12:02.681 --> 12:04.046
What's wrong with his teeth?

12:04.182 --> 12:05.763
That's what I want you to find out.

12:14.234 --> 12:15.223
Brambles are dangerous

with each other.

If you find the kids, wrap them up
in the blankets right away.

VVhy?

12:52.147 --> 12:53.603
I'll need a list.

12:53.732 --> 12:56.018
But cover your sector first.

12:56.151 --> 12:57.482
We need to find those kids.

12:57.611 --> 12:59.192
Okay.

[Dialing cell phone]

[Ringing]

13:08.246 --> 13:09.986
Duke, how's Jennifer doing?

13:10.123 --> 13:12.705
She is...

13:13.377 --> 13:15.083
...fantastic.

13:16.171 --> 13:18.412
Yeah, we've charged her chi,
aligned her chakras.

13:18.548 --> 13:21.255
Now we're just flushing her brain
with blood.

13:21.385 --> 13:22.716
I don't think this is working.

13:22.844 --> 13:25.221
My sinuses are exploding.

13:25.347 --> 13:26.052
I'm coming over.

13:26.181 --> 13:29.093
No,no,no,no,no.
Could you just hang on a second?

13:29.226 --> 13:31.012
You are doing great.

13:31.144 --> 13:33.226
Just...keep hanging.

Hey, Nathan, you come here,

13:36.733 --> 13:38.143
bring some nails
for Audrey's coffin

13:38.276 --> 13:40.892
because having you here is
the last thing that Jennifer needs.

13:41.029 --> 13:42.735
Well, your plan isn't working.

13:42.864 --> 13:43.649
Man, what did you think ——

13:43.782 --> 13:45.397
l was gonna turn her into a yogi
in half a day?

13:45.534 --> 13:47.195
Then what the hell is your plan?

13:47.327 --> 13:48.157
Here '3 an analogy.

13:48.286 --> 13:50.948
Jennifer's at the free—throw line,
one second left in the big game.

13:51.081 --> 13:53.163
Now, if she thinks about it,
she chokes.

13:53.291 --> 13:56.454
So I am trying to distract her
from the pressure,

13:56.586 --> 13:59.248
make her think about anything else
except what she has to do

13:59.381 --> 14:01.372
so she opens up her mind.

14:01.508 --> 14:03.965
And she starts to hear.

14:04.094 --> 14:05.300

14:21.361 --> 14:22.476
Then what are you doing out here?

14:22.612 --> 14:24.864
Because I've got missing children,

—What?
—17.

14:35.959 --> 14:38.371
That's how many people have died
because of the troubles

14:38.503 --> 14:39.879
since I shot Howard.

with every breath I take.

14:47.220 --> 14:49.802
So you know what?
I will find Audrey.

14:49.931 --> 14:53.298
She will kill me.
The troubles will end.

14:53.852 --> 14:55.217
And then I won't have
to think anymore

14:55.353 --> 14:57.765
about all the pain
that I've caused this town.

15:09.993 --> 15:13.281
Then there are bigger prints ——
barefoot, all of them.

15:13.413 --> 15:14.994
I think we're looking
at four kidnappers.

15:15.123 --> 15:17.205
Four troubled 10—year—olds?

15:17.334 --> 15:19.416

Can we make this quick, guys?
I got to get back to the search.

16:07.134 --> 16:09.591
The brambles turned up nothing,
and we're running out of time.

16:09.719 --> 16:12.552
Yes, well, many cultures have tales

16:12.681 --> 16:14.967
of childlike creatures
that steal children.

16:15.100 --> 16:18.513
We've seen before where myths
are explanations for the troubles.

16:18.645 --> 16:20.852
The claws are specific, though,

16:20.981 --> 16:24.064
to an Afro—Caribbean legend
called "Douen".

16:25.026 --> 16:27.768
Douens have clawed feet
and clawed hands.

16:27.904 --> 16:31.613
Their laugh enchants children
to run away from their parents

16:31.741 --> 16:33.572
and go deep into the wilderness.

16:38.915 --> 16:41.406
That's what we're dealing with.

is creating these creatures.

are masters of deception.

she wouldn't harm a child.

37:54.565 --> 37:56.271
...who will I be?

37:56.900 --> 37:59.767
Whoever you most want to be.

38:01.321 --> 38:03.061
Audrey!

38:03.198 --> 38:04.734
Audrey!

38:41.278 --> 38:42.734
No.

39:18.273 --> 39:19.524
Audrey.

39:20.317 --> 39:21.978
Audrey.

39:22.110 --> 39:23.771
Hey.

39:52.808 --> 39:54.639
You made it.

39:55.477 --> 39:57.433
Hi.

39:58.355 --> 40:00.437
Hi.

40:32.014 --> 40:33.879
What are you doing?

40:34.016 --> 40:35.802
The troubles haven't ended.

40:35.934 --> 40:38.676
I know what Howard told you.

40:38.812 --> 40:40.348
Killing me is the only way now.

41:09.343 --> 41:11.459
Please.

41:11.595 --> 41:13.836
Please, Audrey.

41:23.440 --> 41:25.726
I'm not killing anyone.

41:27.069 --> 41:29.981
Certainly not someone
I've never met before.

41:32.532 --> 41:34.068
What?

41:37.079 --> 41:39.115
And who is Audrey?

41:40.332 --> 41:43.199
My name is Lexie.
