Previously,

00:05.420 --> 00:07.670
-So, what is Y?
-I don't know.

00:07.670 --> 00:09.620
I really am
trying to help you, TJ.

00:09.620 --> 00:11.330
I don't know
the answer, okay?

00:11.330 --> 00:13.000
I think you have
a learning disability.

00:13.000 --> 00:15.170
It's like dyslexia,
but with numbers.

00:15.170 --> 00:17.040
Stop web-diagnosing
my issues.

00:17.040 --> 00:19.290
I'd rather they just
think I'm stupid.

00:19.290 --> 00:21.250
Should Jonah and I be
holding hands by now?

00:21.250 --> 00:23.210
I don't see any reason
not to be holding this hand.

00:23.210 --> 00:25.290
And yet, he isn't holding it.

00:25.290 --> 00:27.670
I don't know what's going on
in Jonah's head,

00:27.670 --> 00:30.460
-but boys can be pretty dumb.
-(chuckles)

00:56.120 --> 00:57.830
Bummer.
What's a bimah?

I can get you into
the candle-lighting ceremony,

01:15.500 --> 01:16.830
You'll all have to share
one candle.

Please don't make me choose
who gets to light it.

01:19.380 --> 01:21.670
-Oy!

Oh, it's totally fixable.

I... want to.

Okay, then, no rush.

Wouldn't he want me to rush?

I'm happy you want

but the real person
you should be talking to

03:01.750 --> 03:03.080
is Mr. Coleman.

03:03.080 --> 03:06.040
Absolutely.
I'm gonna do that.

03:06.040 --> 03:07.580
But in the meantime...

03:10.500 --> 03:12.620
I need someone to do

-You are my tutor.

I'm gonna cheat for you!

It's not cheating, it's...
helping a teammate stay

03:22.040 --> 03:24.790
-I have a moral code.
-People cheat all the time!

03:24.790 --> 03:26.670

03:33.670 --> 03:34.750
So, about my bar mitzvah--

03:34.750 --> 03:36.500
Not now, Cyrus.

03:36.500 --> 03:38.420
Just, really quick,
I wanna invite TJ.

-Are you cool with that?
-Whatever.

03:40.540 --> 03:41.830
That was easy.

03:43.120 --> 03:45.380
Hey, not-so-scary
basketball guy!

03:46.710 --> 03:48.750
Hey, underdog!

03:48.750 --> 03:51.080
-What's up?
-Well, I know it's
kind of last minute,

03:51.080 --> 03:54.170
but if I could get
an RSVP ASAP,

03:54.170 --> 03:57.540
I think I can get you
into my bar mitzvah par-tee.

04:00.750 --> 04:01.500
I'm there.

04:02.580 --> 04:05.620
Hey, uh,
can I ask you something
about Buffy?

04:05.620 --> 04:08.540
-Sure.
-Is she always
so high and mighty?

04:08.540 --> 04:12.620
-Pretty much.
-Let's say I needed to get her
to do something for me.

04:12.620 --> 04:13.920
How would I go about
doing that?

04:13.920 --> 04:16.540
Easy, just use
her two favorite words.

04:16.540 --> 04:18.960
-"I'm sorry"?
-No, she hates those words.

04:18.960 --> 04:21.580
Then what?

04:21.580 --> 04:26.080
Come with me.
You might not like saying this,
but Buffy will love hearing it.

04:27.540 --> 04:29.670
And so, my fellow graduates,

04:29.670 --> 04:34.420
as we all head out
into the world for the first,
or, perhaps, tenth time,

04:34.420 --> 04:37.170
go forth and embrace
your new lives

04:37.170 --> 04:40.420
as fully credentialed
cosmetologists.

04:40.420 --> 04:43.960
But don't feel like
you need to possess
all the answers right away.

04:43.960 --> 04:47.250
Life is like any of the faces
we've worked on:

04:47.250 --> 04:50.580
you make it up as you go along.

04:50.580 --> 04:53.460
Pause for laughs,
pause for laughs...

04:53.460 --> 04:54.790
Thank you.

04:54.790 --> 04:56.380
I'm so proud of you!

04:56.380 --> 04:58.710
Oh, okay,
don't oversell it.

04:58.710 --> 05:02.790
-It's not that big of a deal.
-Yes, it is, that you're
valedictorian.

05:02.790 --> 05:04.960
There was a one-in-twelve chance
of that happening,

05:04.960 --> 05:06.670
which makes it slightly
less impressive.

05:06.670 --> 05:09.210
So, who's gonna be there,
besides me?

05:09.210 --> 05:11.380
No one.
You're my entire guest list.

05:11.380 --> 05:13.580
What about CeCe and Pops?

05:13.580 --> 05:16.960
Nah. She was hoping for more
of a college degree,

05:16.960 --> 05:19.830
not a license to clean nail beds
and make a smokey eye.

05:19.830 --> 05:22.040
But you're gonna
invite Bowie, right?

05:22.040 --> 05:25.290
I don't know.
After the other day,
I'm just not--

Yeah. Me neither.

-No! I'll do it.
-You'll be happy you did.

back to the time

07:31.170 --> 07:34.290

08:08.670 --> 08:10.880
You tossed the coins
six times.

08:10.880 --> 08:12.790
Each coin toss
comes with a mark.

08:12.790 --> 08:15.710
Each mark becomes
part of the hexagram.

08:15.710 --> 08:18.620
There are 64 possible hexagrams.

-But Pops made a noise!

Is it about me and Jonah?

08:47.830 --> 08:51.000
Does the I Ching say
that we're splitting apart?

08:51.000 --> 08:53.620
The I Ching is only a guide.

The interpretation

Could it be referring to that?

It's probably about something
bigger than the bracelet.
