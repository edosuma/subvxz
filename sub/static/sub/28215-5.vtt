WEBVTT

00:02.110 --> 00:03.633
17!

00:04.687 --> 00:06.210
18!

00:07.156 --> 00:08.420
19!

00:08.445 --> 00:10.843
Ow. Sarika, he's gonna break the record!

00:11.117 --> 00:13.272
Okie dokie, everybody.

00:13.297 --> 00:15.397
Sit down and start to shut up.

00:16.600 --> 00:18.175
Uh... oh, hey.

00:18.200 --> 00:20.800
Kudos for you guys
acting like normal teens.

00:20.825 --> 00:23.710
Normally when I walk in here
it's like a freaking creep show.

00:25.788 --> 00:26.938
I just found out today that

00:26.940 --> 00:29.119
I have a mailbox here
at this school. Who knew?

00:29.158 --> 00:30.688
My family's mailbox

00:30.713 --> 00:33.483
is a tiny replica of our actual house.

00:33.633 --> 00:36.263
I like to imagine a tiny
Victor lives in there

00:36.438 --> 00:39.927
and that my house is a mailbox
for an even bigger Victor.

00:40.169 --> 00:41.447
Good to know, Vic.

00:41.472 --> 00:43.107
All right, Sarika, I
need you to separate out

00:43.131 --> 00:44.889
all the mail order catalogues, okay?

00:44.914 --> 00:46.877
The junk mail's great
research for my book.

00:46.878 --> 00:49.477
I want to examine why
people find happiness

00:49.478 --> 00:51.647
through the consumption
of ridiculous products.

00:51.648 --> 00:54.567
So, uh, who here has parents
that have bought things

00:54.592 --> 00:56.192
off of an infomercial?

00:56.435 --> 00:58.763
My mom swears by the Ped-Scraper.

00:58.788 --> 01:01.778
It's like this potato peeler
for the dead skin on your feet.

01:01.803 --> 01:03.638
It reveals her glowing, sexy foot

01:03.663 --> 01:05.322
without the price of a spa.

01:05.348 --> 01:08.278
Hmm, guys, I can't be the
only one who cuts him off.

01:08.498 --> 01:10.167
All right, now who else has something?

01:10.168 --> 01:12.167
Hey, yo, Jackie. Jackie.

01:12.168 --> 01:13.493
Yeah, man. Over here, man.

01:13.518 --> 01:15.337
Check this out. You ready for this?

01:15.362 --> 01:17.032
- I am.
- So, yo, you ready?

01:17.533 --> 01:18.626
Yes.

01:18.651 --> 01:21.173
If I told you that you can
cook an egg inside your pocket

01:21.448 --> 01:23.478
while you're in the
gym, would you buy it?

01:23.542 --> 01:24.665
Is that real?

01:24.690 --> 01:26.820
These are the A.P. Bio practice exams!

01:26.845 --> 01:28.445
Yeah, well, Sarika,
you don't really need

01:28.470 --> 01:30.470
to practice for something
you're never going to do.

01:32.000 --> 01:38.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:41.315 --> 01:43.128
All right, who else here
has a house filled with,

01:43.152 --> 01:44.592
like, infomercial crap?

01:44.617 --> 01:47.264
Marissa! You seem like you probably got

01:47.289 --> 01:48.929
a couple of hoarders in your household.

01:49.108 --> 01:51.506
- Pappy loves treasure.
- I bet.

01:52.348 --> 01:54.983
You will hand over the
practice tests right now

01:55.467 --> 01:58.092
or I'm gonna show everyone these.

01:58.569 --> 01:59.678
What are those?

02:05.388 --> 02:07.591
This is pictures of me and Lynette.

02:07.958 --> 02:10.894
Wow, these are... these are great.

02:10.919 --> 02:12.075
Sarika, did you take these?

02:12.100 --> 02:14.144
That's very creepy of you, but
these are really good shots.

02:14.168 --> 02:16.108
- Can I keep these?
- Yes.

02:16.326 --> 02:19.026
And just so you know,
I'm a grown-up ass man

02:19.113 --> 02:21.083
and I don't get embarrassed
when I like somebody.

02:21.794 --> 02:24.082
Same here. I like Grace.

02:26.545 --> 02:28.345
No, I... I'm embarrassed.

02:28.370 --> 02:29.639
That was embarrassing.

02:30.978 --> 02:32.578
One, two, three, four!

02:47.538 --> 02:48.808
Mr. Jack Griffin.

02:48.833 --> 02:51.224
You, sir, are suspected of murder.

02:51.249 --> 02:53.029
Mur... is this about Tampa?

02:53.766 --> 02:55.767
I can't... I... I... I...
I'm tired of explaining this.

02:55.791 --> 02:57.650
Look, if you call it a dolphin ride,

02:57.675 --> 02:59.598
I'm gonna mount it. All
right, they didn't tell me

02:59.622 --> 03:01.207
that you're supposed to
just ride on its tail.

03:01.231 --> 03:02.671
How the hell was I supposed to know?

03:04.605 --> 03:07.152
I was just reminding you about
my murder mystery party tonight.

03:07.810 --> 03:09.050
Oh, God. Oh yeah, got it.

03:09.075 --> 03:10.235
Yeah. No, thanks. Thank you.

03:10.535 --> 03:11.996
- Thank you. Ew.
- Yeah.

03:15.634 --> 03:17.611
Hey, man, congrats on the party invite.

03:17.947 --> 03:19.508
I bet it never gets old.

03:19.533 --> 03:20.903
Yeah, respect.

03:21.098 --> 03:22.144
Yes, respect.

03:22.340 --> 03:24.840
- Socializing is important.
- Okay, thanks, guys.

03:24.865 --> 03:26.613
I appreciate the respect.
Yuyao, thank you,

03:26.638 --> 03:28.568
but needless to say,
I won't be attending.

03:28.871 --> 03:30.465
Look, I'm gonna tell you guys
something that's not really

03:30.489 --> 03:32.523
going to register for
probably ten-plus years

03:32.548 --> 03:35.996
but alone on your couch is
the ultimate Friday night.

03:41.761 --> 03:43.461
We need those practice tests.

03:43.550 --> 03:46.479
If we don't get them, we'll be forced
to study with online knockoffs.

03:47.596 --> 03:49.838
We need to sneak in
tonight and take them.

03:49.863 --> 03:51.378
- Oh...
- Sorry, Sarika.

03:51.403 --> 03:53.833
We already have a plan to
meet up for hot dogs at Target.

03:54.068 --> 03:55.269
Grace is working.

03:55.294 --> 03:56.794
VIP treatment.

03:56.819 --> 03:59.719
Trust us, it's fun. It's really fun.

03:59.744 --> 04:01.884
- Fun is not important.
- Wrong.

04:01.909 --> 04:03.690
Do you wanna nail the A.P. Bio exam

04:03.715 --> 04:05.115
and go to college or not?

04:05.140 --> 04:07.740
Uh, college is going to be pretty sick.

04:07.937 --> 04:10.251
Eating ramen and snatching V-cards.

04:11.129 --> 04:12.223
We're in.

04:12.248 --> 04:13.587
Meet back here at dark.

04:14.348 --> 04:16.321
What... what time is dark?

04:16.843 --> 04:17.845
8:00.

04:17.870 --> 04:19.369
What time does "Room Raiders" come on?

04:19.392 --> 04:21.587
- It's... it's early.
- It's, like, 7:30.

04:23.671 --> 04:25.463
Last year the murderer kept putting

04:25.488 --> 04:27.194
the kill stickers on our butts!

04:27.219 --> 04:30.737
Buttholes! Okay, I'm
telling you, she aimed.

04:30.762 --> 04:34.003
I would not miss this party for anything.

04:34.028 --> 04:35.512
Unless my mom wakes up.

04:36.053 --> 04:38.926
Oh, and I just love the theme this year.

04:38.951 --> 04:41.848
I know! Murder at Whitlock High

04:41.873 --> 04:44.549
Instead of playing, like,
butlers and aging starlets,

04:44.574 --> 04:45.973
we get to play each other!

04:45.998 --> 04:47.147
Ooh, are you going to Michelle's

04:47.171 --> 04:49.646
murder mystery party, Jackie Chan?

04:49.671 --> 04:51.348
Ah, I can't unfortunately.

04:51.373 --> 04:53.893
I've got firm plans to
sort through my junk mail.

04:53.918 --> 04:55.594
Oh, Jack, you've got to go!

04:55.619 --> 04:57.642
I... I can pick you
up in any car you want.

04:57.667 --> 04:59.577
I have a trick that I use at Enterprise.

04:59.602 --> 05:01.594
You ask for a 15 passenger van.

05:01.882 --> 05:02.927
They never have one

05:02.952 --> 05:06.486
and then you drive off in
whatever sweet ride you choose.

05:08.638 --> 05:11.177
I can't wait to play one
of you guys this year.

05:11.178 --> 05:12.890
Oh, you guys talking murder party?

05:12.915 --> 05:14.553
Yup. Uh, you're still coming, right?

05:14.578 --> 05:16.601
Of course. I'm the reigning champ.

05:17.007 --> 05:19.233
Last year, I solved the
mystery in 47 minutes.

05:19.748 --> 05:22.427
Broke Durbin's record and
he is a brilliant detective.

05:23.483 --> 05:26.050
Hey, well, my ex-wife
always called me Sherlock.

05:26.075 --> 05:28.322
Like when I would ask her,
"Hey, are you cheating on me?"

05:28.347 --> 05:30.333
And she would go, "What
do you think, Sherlock?"

05:30.358 --> 05:31.905
And I also solved the mystery

05:31.930 --> 05:33.799
of my neighbor's missing penis.

05:33.824 --> 05:36.467
Turns out, it was inside my wife.

05:36.492 --> 05:37.622
Oh!

05:41.914 --> 05:44.444
Feels good to laugh.

05:45.507 --> 05:47.621
Yeah, so it took you 47 minutes

05:47.646 --> 05:49.582
to solve a silly parlor game?

05:49.607 --> 05:51.160
Oh, you think you can do it faster?

05:51.185 --> 05:52.785
Oh, I know I can.

05:52.810 --> 05:54.940
- Game on.
- Okay.

05:55.634 --> 05:57.164
Ooh-la-la.

05:57.189 --> 05:59.943
Looks like someone is
trying to impress someone.

05:59.968 --> 06:02.168
Yeah, well, if that first someone is me

06:02.193 --> 06:04.124
and that second someone is Lynette

06:04.149 --> 06:06.318
then someone is correct.

06:06.343 --> 06:08.503
Ooh!

06:08.528 --> 06:10.467
I was gesturing to you.
You're that other someone.

06:10.468 --> 06:11.776
Damn it, Jack.

06:11.800 --> 06:14.413
You used up the rest of our
break time for that nonsense?

06:14.438 --> 06:16.686
- Right.
- And that someone is you.

06:16.711 --> 06:18.641
- Boo!
- Come on someone.

06:25.115 --> 06:26.715
I can't believe they had one!

06:38.928 --> 06:41.567
Welcome to hell.

06:42.866 --> 06:44.841
If you find a sticker on you,

06:44.866 --> 06:47.766
you've been murdered.

06:49.416 --> 06:52.441
- Hmm.
- Keith will be providing the ambiance.

06:54.100 --> 06:55.502
- I really do love you so much.
- I love you.

06:55.526 --> 06:57.009
I'm... I'm also in love with you.

06:57.078 --> 06:58.717
- I remain in love with you.
- You stay perfect.

06:58.718 --> 07:01.038
Thanks for coming everyone
and welcome to hell.

07:04.323 --> 07:07.293
You're all to remain in
character as each other.

07:07.509 --> 07:09.539
The game ends when someone
catches the murderer

07:09.564 --> 07:12.923
in the act or the murderer kills us all.

07:13.542 --> 07:16.312
Winner gets this trophy.

07:16.337 --> 07:17.567
- Ooh!
- Sweet.

07:17.592 --> 07:20.032
Yes, queen. Yes!

07:20.108 --> 07:23.277
Wow, you know what? I see you, Coach.

07:23.278 --> 07:24.490
I see you.

07:24.515 --> 07:25.901
We begin with...

07:25.926 --> 07:28.626
A murder!

07:31.429 --> 07:33.929
- It's you, Dave.
- No, it's not!

07:33.954 --> 07:35.334
If you would lay down,

07:35.359 --> 07:37.795
you're our kickoff
murder victim this year!

07:37.820 --> 07:39.963
I was the first victim last year!

07:39.988 --> 07:41.859
I drove all the way
from Morenci for this.

07:41.884 --> 07:42.906
- We know, Dave.
- Down.

07:42.931 --> 07:44.218
I mean, I just loaded up.

07:44.243 --> 07:46.544
I... I, you know, I
haven't taken a bite yet.

07:46.569 --> 07:48.129
- Down.
- We know. We know.

07:48.154 --> 07:49.521
- Dave, come on.
- Really.

07:50.535 --> 07:52.205
- You all want that?
- Yes!

07:52.230 --> 07:53.632
- Well, keep your eyes open.
- It just doesn't seem fair.

07:53.656 --> 07:54.986
I mean, two years in a row.

07:55.011 --> 07:56.542
Uh, but... what would
you do if it was...

07:56.566 --> 07:58.297
it's just not right!

07:58.322 --> 08:00.792
- Down, David.
- I don't wanna do it.

08:00.817 --> 08:05.077
I'm laying down because I
respect the rules of the game.

08:05.102 --> 08:07.562
I live in Morenci. Ugh!

08:08.334 --> 08:10.726
And I believe you all
have your assignments.

08:10.751 --> 08:14.181
Let the games begin!

08:16.120 --> 08:17.603
Clock's ticking.

08:18.325 --> 08:19.955
Um, oh, J'accuse!

08:20.128 --> 08:22.367
J'accuse. Yeah, Michelle?

08:22.368 --> 08:24.737
Your music-y husband there
with the too-much-equipment.

08:24.738 --> 08:27.025
Yup, I see him touching
Mary's elbow there.

08:27.050 --> 08:28.837
Why don't you check your elbow?
I bet you'll find a sticker.

08:28.838 --> 08:31.162
Oh, I... I just wanted
to feel the fabric.

08:31.187 --> 08:32.990
I'm kind of a textile head.

08:33.760 --> 08:35.490
Wait, you're Helen?

08:36.490 --> 08:37.659
I'm Helen!

08:37.684 --> 08:39.054
Maybe that's a clue!

08:39.217 --> 08:42.441
Or maybe it's a...

08:42.466 --> 08:46.006
Mistake!

08:53.498 --> 08:55.167
Okay.

08:55.168 --> 08:57.437
Let's go. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

09:01.352 --> 09:03.882
Whoa, the faculty lounge.

09:04.048 --> 09:07.077
This is where the teachers
talk about what pills they use.

09:07.078 --> 09:08.474
- Wait.
- Come on, Sarika.

09:08.499 --> 09:10.617
No. No, you guys.

09:14.188 --> 09:16.844
The murderer has struck again!

09:17.791 --> 09:19.161
Uh-oh!

09:19.186 --> 09:21.416
Oh, ooh.

09:21.441 --> 09:22.854
Oh, he snuck a drink
in there, didn't he?

09:25.147 --> 09:27.621
Who amongst us shall be next?

09:27.646 --> 09:29.700
Oh, I... I hope it's not me.

09:29.725 --> 09:31.597
I live in Morenci.

09:32.966 --> 09:34.497
- He's... he's still doing Dave.
- That's good.

09:34.521 --> 09:36.091
That was really good. Get him, Durb!

09:36.116 --> 09:37.519
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

09:37.544 --> 09:39.044
Who's... who's over there near Fred?

09:39.069 --> 09:40.303
Helen, you were over there.

09:40.801 --> 09:42.101
You're the murderer.

09:42.126 --> 09:43.526
I mean, you seem nervous.

09:43.551 --> 09:44.671
No, I'm not... I'm not... I'm not...

09:44.695 --> 09:47.622
Which, you know, makes sense
because you are 25 minutes in

09:47.647 --> 09:50.917
and it looks like that
record is slipping away.

09:50.942 --> 09:52.813
You only have two accusations left.

09:52.838 --> 09:54.181
Look, it doesn't matter
because I'm gonna...

09:54.205 --> 09:55.843
- I'm gonna...
- Tick tock, tick tock.

09:55.868 --> 09:57.213
Well, that's fine
because I'm just gonna...

09:57.237 --> 09:58.867
I'm gonna go ahead
and end this right now.

09:58.868 --> 10:00.788
Michelle, I have an accusation to make.

10:00.813 --> 10:02.793
I accuse Helen of murder! J'accuse,

10:02.818 --> 10:03.930
- j'accuse!
- What?

10:03.955 --> 10:07.188
Okay, thanks. Remember,
you're playing coach.

10:07.500 --> 10:08.687
He doesn't know French.

10:08.712 --> 10:09.773
I know enough.

10:14.718 --> 10:17.548
Tell me the truth, Mary. Did
you put the sticker on him?

10:17.558 --> 10:19.147
Hey, no Mary here.

10:19.545 --> 10:21.334
Fake Mary's over there, laying down,

10:21.588 --> 10:23.387
wearing a pair of boner-killing khakis

10:23.388 --> 10:25.188
that no woman would ever wear.

10:25.198 --> 10:26.727
That is not true!

10:26.728 --> 10:28.597
I borrowed these from my wife!

10:28.598 --> 10:31.228
"I borrowed these from my wife!"

10:31.238 --> 10:33.867
Get him, Durb!

10:33.868 --> 10:36.538
What's your favorite
type of brown coffee?

10:37.638 --> 10:39.777
- Folgers.
- Me too.

10:39.778 --> 10:42.747
There's a lot of
half-eaten salads in here.

10:42.748 --> 10:44.947
I'm just gonna take a Cobb.

10:44.948 --> 10:47.264
My parents paid for it
with their tax dollars.

10:47.289 --> 10:48.747
Guys.

10:48.748 --> 10:50.148
Stop goofing around.

10:51.190 --> 10:52.418
I got the key.

10:52.443 --> 10:53.792
Let's get these tests.

10:54.988 --> 10:57.927
Hi, Helen. I'm Jack, I'm an Ivy Leaguer

10:57.928 --> 11:01.138
and I'm not the murderer because
I'm too busy stomping around

11:01.163 --> 11:04.583
and grumping around and,
uh, shopping for sweaters.

11:04.608 --> 11:05.967
Yes!

11:05.968 --> 11:09.163
And howdy, I'm Helen
and I'm not the murderer

11:09.188 --> 11:12.113
because I'm too busy buying sweatshirts.

11:17.448 --> 11:18.521
Wow.

11:19.216 --> 11:20.271
You bitch.

11:25.158 --> 11:27.618
Did you just touch my back?
Did you put a sticker on me?

11:27.628 --> 11:29.457
- Dude.
- Hey, hey Jack.

11:29.458 --> 11:31.188
- What are you doing?
- Whoa!

11:31.198 --> 11:32.627
Have you solved it yet?

11:32.628 --> 11:34.027
'Cause your time is nearly up.

11:34.028 --> 11:35.752
Yeah, you know what? I think I got it.

11:35.777 --> 11:37.619
I'm gonna make a... I'm gonna j'accuse.

11:37.644 --> 11:39.044
- Check this out.
- Yeah? All right.

11:39.868 --> 11:41.467
- A food drive?
- Yeah.

11:41.468 --> 11:43.507
- Hey, ladies.
- Oh, Jack. Hi.

11:43.508 --> 11:44.653
- Hi.
- Hi!

11:44.678 --> 11:47.514
Yeah, save it, lady. I saw you
over by the snack table earlier.

11:47.539 --> 11:50.139
Yeah, where Ms.
Malinowski got stickered?

11:50.164 --> 11:51.592
Oh, no!

11:51.617 --> 11:54.293
Oh, I'm onto you, you
sneaky son of a bitch.

11:54.318 --> 11:55.848
Excuse me?

11:56.656 --> 11:59.056
Uh, yeah, I bet you if I reach
into this pocket right now,

11:59.081 --> 12:00.718
what am I gonna find?
I think I'm gonna...

12:00.728 --> 12:02.187
well, I think I'm just gonna find a...

12:02.188 --> 12:04.063
Ow! Why do you have
forks in your pocket?

12:04.498 --> 12:06.127
Okay, Jack, Jack, take it easy.

12:06.128 --> 12:08.058
Oh, go easy. Let's
go... everybody go easy.

12:08.068 --> 12:10.309
No, no, no, I'm sorry, Ralph,
but I'm trying to play the game.

12:10.333 --> 12:11.932
Isn't that why we're
here? To play the game?

12:11.933 --> 12:13.472
All right, you... you know
what? You guys are just jealous

12:13.473 --> 12:14.491
'cause I'm gonna break the record.

12:14.515 --> 12:16.435
That's... that's what it is.
'Cause I'm... I'm a winner.

12:16.459 --> 12:18.259
Yeah, I'm the smartest guy here!

12:18.284 --> 12:20.330
And I'm going to be at home
eating that cookie cake

12:20.354 --> 12:21.914
while you guys are in your beds

12:21.939 --> 12:23.699
pulling stickers out of your buttholes!

12:23.724 --> 12:25.024
Hmm?

12:26.378 --> 12:27.798
You know what? I... you
know what I'm gonna do?

12:27.822 --> 12:29.081
I'm gonna go to the kitchen.

12:31.894 --> 12:34.011
Mavis, we're gonna need
those forks back, okay?

12:34.036 --> 12:35.396
Hmm?

12:38.463 --> 12:40.533
I don't know if she heard me or not.

12:44.399 --> 12:45.955
Oh, God.

12:47.433 --> 12:49.602
That was an awesome meltdown.

12:49.603 --> 12:51.433
Well, you sure seem like you enjoyed it.

12:51.458 --> 12:54.431
"I'm the smartest one here"?
I mean, that was spectacular.

12:54.456 --> 12:55.856
Mm-hmm. By the way,

12:55.881 --> 12:57.572
why are you carrying that folder around?

12:58.169 --> 12:59.611
Durbin always has a folder.

13:00.094 --> 13:01.851
- No, he doesn't.
- Yes, he does.

13:02.889 --> 13:04.189
- J'accuse.
- What?

13:04.214 --> 13:05.544
J'accuse! Let me see this thing.

13:05.569 --> 13:06.809
What's in here?

13:06.834 --> 13:09.446
Oh-ho-ho! You're the killer!

13:09.471 --> 13:11.268
Ho-ho! I win. I win, what time is it?

13:11.293 --> 13:12.330
Did I... did I break the record?

13:12.354 --> 13:13.517
- There's just one problem.
- What?

13:13.541 --> 13:15.441
You died ten seconds ago.

13:17.101 --> 13:18.941
What did you... oh, when you came in.

13:18.966 --> 13:20.531
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.
- Yeah, oh, damn it.

13:20.556 --> 13:22.765
You know, if we form an alliance,

13:23.335 --> 13:26.481
I think I can win and end
this game in record time.

13:26.506 --> 13:27.776
What's in it for me?

13:27.801 --> 13:30.777
10,000 cookie cake calories.

13:30.802 --> 13:32.303
- Mmm, I love cookie cakes. I'm in.
- Yeah.

13:32.327 --> 13:34.967
Dial that coach thing
up to, like, an 11.

13:34.992 --> 13:36.492
I can handle that.

13:36.517 --> 13:39.347
That's good. Let's go kill our friends.

13:46.182 --> 13:48.552
Strong enough for a man,
strong enough for a woman.

13:48.577 --> 13:51.207
Who gives a rip? It's all deodorant.

13:51.232 --> 13:52.992
So good.

13:53.017 --> 13:54.617
I liked it.

13:54.642 --> 13:56.502
I thought I was talking to coach.

13:56.527 --> 13:58.827
Now a mesh short,
that'll let 'em breathe,

13:58.852 --> 14:01.352
but spandex will save
you from the chafe.

14:01.377 --> 14:03.503
Bingo, but you still got a talc.

14:03.528 --> 14:04.917
Oh, ya got a talc.

14:04.942 --> 14:06.712
Yeah!

14:06.737 --> 14:09.354
Any dope with a dingus can be a father,

14:09.583 --> 14:12.110
but it takes a real man to be a dad.

14:12.670 --> 14:14.345
Get on in here champ!

14:14.370 --> 14:16.375
Huh? Give us a hug?

14:23.888 --> 14:25.121
Oh, heck.

14:26.142 --> 14:28.044
How does a Harvard man die?

14:28.851 --> 14:30.074
Uh...

14:30.373 --> 14:32.184
Oh, treachery!

14:32.528 --> 14:34.536
Oh, sweet dagger!

14:34.818 --> 14:36.708
Horatio, I'm dying.

14:36.756 --> 14:39.896
Oh, my kingdom for a horse!

14:39.921 --> 14:42.051
Ooh, ooh.

14:43.761 --> 14:45.361
Ow, I'm Jack!

14:45.627 --> 14:47.387
That is... that's how you would die.

14:47.412 --> 14:49.213
Leg work, okay.

14:49.238 --> 14:51.150
Oh, no! Your butt got murdered again!

14:51.175 --> 14:53.214
Oh, no, wait. Let me
see yours. Let me see.

14:53.954 --> 14:55.784
Oh, it got you too!

14:55.816 --> 14:57.275
Oh, girl, let's go die at a wine table.

14:57.276 --> 14:58.776
- Come on.
- Man!

14:58.786 --> 15:01.615
- Oh, hell. I'm out.
- Me too.

15:32.686 --> 15:35.216
Whoa!

15:35.576 --> 15:36.891
Not too fast, not too fast!

15:39.756 --> 15:42.586
You guys, I did it! I got the
tests from Mr. Griffin's desk!

15:42.596 --> 15:45.137
We just found the janitors'
mops and we're gonna joust.

15:45.434 --> 15:47.001
We are not supposed to be having fun.

15:47.387 --> 15:48.926
There's no question on
the Harvard application

15:48.936 --> 15:50.637
about how much fun I had in high school.

15:53.036 --> 15:54.290
Look.

15:55.126 --> 15:56.329
I know I'm a lot.

15:56.853 --> 15:58.205
I know nobody likes me.

15:58.206 --> 16:00.875
We like you Sarika. Right, guys?

16:00.876 --> 16:02.845
- Yeah, you're fun.
- You're hardcore.

16:02.846 --> 16:04.167
You're my best friend.

16:04.946 --> 16:06.081
Oh.

16:07.546 --> 16:08.636
Thank you.

16:08.956 --> 16:11.785
So what do you say?

16:18.296 --> 16:19.725
I guess I could do one joust.

16:21.196 --> 16:22.995
Just so we can get out of here.

16:22.996 --> 16:24.965
- Aim for the soft meat!
- Shut up.

16:26.166 --> 16:28.366
Three, two, one.

16:29.976 --> 16:32.936
Oh, my God!

16:33.546 --> 16:34.745
That was amazing.

16:34.746 --> 16:36.545
- That was amazing.
- That was good.

16:36.546 --> 16:38.215
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

16:38.216 --> 16:39.987
Are you not gonna tell them
that you're the murderer?

16:40.011 --> 16:42.915
No, I think I want it
to be a mystery forever.

16:42.916 --> 16:44.585
Kind of like a Zodiac
Killer type of thing.

16:44.586 --> 16:45.922
Ooh!

16:45.947 --> 16:47.248
Hey, so, I don't know if you noticed,

16:47.272 --> 16:49.039
but I grabbed your
trophy on the way out.

16:49.064 --> 16:50.748
That's a delicious looking cookie cake.

16:50.773 --> 16:53.095
Are you just gonna eat
it by yourself or...?

16:53.096 --> 16:55.226
I mean, technically,
half this thing's mine,

16:55.236 --> 16:58.367
so if you wanted to go
somewhere and split it.

16:59.046 --> 17:01.136
You know what I've always wanted to do?

17:02.310 --> 17:03.919
To kick a field goal.

17:04.876 --> 17:07.646
- Right now?
- What, you busy?

17:08.715 --> 17:09.915
No.

17:14.068 --> 17:15.068
And..

17:15.756 --> 17:17.157
here's the kick!

17:20.049 --> 17:22.630
Going, going, it's gone!

17:22.655 --> 17:24.785
It's good!

17:24.810 --> 17:25.970
Oh!

17:25.994 --> 17:28.234
You know, it's true what they say.

17:28.846 --> 17:30.752
I am great at football.

17:31.393 --> 17:32.406
Yes, you are.

17:32.431 --> 17:33.440
Okay, who wants to go next?

17:33.464 --> 17:34.864
Heather, You want some of this?

17:34.889 --> 17:36.849
Bitch, I was born to joust you.

17:36.874 --> 17:38.914
Oh!

17:38.939 --> 17:40.269
Hey, can you guys let me know

17:40.294 --> 17:42.464
if you find, like, a little screw?

17:42.489 --> 17:44.789
- Let's do it!
- Three, two, one, roll!

17:46.029 --> 17:47.259
Anthony, watch out!

17:50.215 --> 17:52.010
Hey, what are you kids doing in here?

17:53.117 --> 17:54.547
Run!

17:55.897 --> 17:58.324
- Really? Come back!
- Go, go! Aah!

17:58.349 --> 18:00.779
Stop! Stop right there!

18:01.783 --> 18:02.943
Stop!

18:02.968 --> 18:04.788
Go, go, go!

18:06.679 --> 18:08.780
- Sarika, the tests!
- Oh, no.

18:10.380 --> 18:12.076
You know what? Leave them.

18:12.101 --> 18:13.244
Go, go, go! Oh, my God!

18:13.269 --> 18:14.809
This is so much fun!

18:14.834 --> 18:17.560
Seriously, can I tell you something that

18:18.654 --> 18:19.737
might be hard to hear?

18:19.762 --> 18:21.264
Oh, absolutely. I
can't wait to hear this.

18:22.973 --> 18:24.519
You impression of Coach sucked.

18:24.544 --> 18:26.538
- Oh, no,
- It was bad.

18:26.563 --> 18:27.952
No, my Coach was excellent.

18:28.288 --> 18:29.761
- I, on the other hand...
- Mm-hmm.

18:30.791 --> 18:32.191
I did a perfect Durbin.

18:32.216 --> 18:35.401
- Yeah, it was pretty good.
- In fact, I'm still doing Durbin.

18:36.211 --> 18:38.037
Everything I've said tonight. Durbin.

18:38.062 --> 18:39.127
- Really.
- Mm-hmm.

18:39.128 --> 18:41.039
Ev... everything you're
saying and doing right now,

18:41.063 --> 18:42.654
that's not you, that's you doing Durbin?

18:42.678 --> 18:43.808
Every single thing.

18:48.308 --> 18:49.738
How about now?

18:52.438 --> 18:54.579
- Yeah.
- Really, still Durbin?

18:54.604 --> 18:55.861
Still Durbin.

18:56.708 --> 18:58.368
- Still Durbin?
- Still Durbin.

18:59.025 --> 19:00.248
- How about right now?
- Yep.

19:07.988 --> 19:10.188
You need to sign your permission slips!

19:10.388 --> 19:12.157
Oh, Ralph.

19:17.735 --> 19:19.765
Whoa, guys, guys!
Stop, stop, stop, stop.

19:19.998 --> 19:21.467
Is that Mr. Griffin?

19:21.468 --> 19:23.667
Yeah. That's that payroll lady he lies.

19:23.668 --> 19:25.737
- Aww.
- Get some!

19:27.178 --> 19:29.693
Let's go! Let's go, let's go,
let's go! Let's go!

19:35.588 --> 19:37.451
Everyone's having fun but me.

19:43.195 --> 19:44.625
So what do you think? You'll...

19:45.163 --> 19:46.882
sign with the Chargers, Patriots?

19:46.907 --> 19:47.907
- Ooh.
- Me?

19:47.923 --> 19:49.483
I'm probably heading to Green Bay.

19:49.743 --> 19:51.344
Yeah, you know what? I...
I think I'd think I'd sign with

19:51.368 --> 19:52.914
any of them to get out of Toledo.

19:54.056 --> 19:55.386
You don't like living in Toledo?

19:55.412 --> 19:56.972
God, no. No.

19:56.997 --> 19:58.249
Can't wait to get out of here.

19:58.978 --> 20:01.638
I'm thinking probably
Tokyo, maybe Berlin.

20:01.648 --> 20:03.678
You know, London if a lot goes wrong.

20:04.204 --> 20:05.934
Okay, well, I'm here to stay.

20:08.466 --> 20:10.744
Oh. Come on, really?

20:11.351 --> 20:12.361
Yeah.

20:13.018 --> 20:14.488
I love Toledo.

20:15.796 --> 20:16.849
Okay.

20:17.488 --> 20:18.959
Well, I...

20:19.948 --> 20:21.115
don't like it.

20:22.788 --> 20:24.022
