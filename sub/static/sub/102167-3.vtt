WEBVTT

00:09.718 --> 00:11.303
It's showtime, folks!

00:11.386 --> 00:14.014
-Just give me some room. Ready.
-Ready.

00:14.097 --> 00:15.474
-Ready.
-Ready.

00:18.352 --> 00:21.522
We interrupt this program to bring you
the following special news report.

00:21.605 --> 00:23.232
Here is Paul Michaels.

00:23.315 --> 00:24.525
Good morning.

00:24.608 --> 00:26.151
A dramatic situation is unfolding

00:26.235 --> 00:28.737
in the Central American country
of Panama today,

00:28.820 --> 00:31.573
where four US soldiers
appear to have been taken hostage

00:31.657 --> 00:34.743
during anti-American riots
in the capital city.

00:34.826 --> 00:37.204
We take you now to the Rose Garden
of the White House,

00:37.287 --> 00:41.291
where President Reagan is expected
to give remarks any moment now.

00:42.543 --> 00:44.795
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:44.878 --> 00:47.130
yesterday's act of terrorism,

00:47.214 --> 00:51.385
in which four American soldiers
were taken hostage in Panama City

00:51.468 --> 00:53.637
by proxies of the Soviet Union,

00:53.720 --> 00:57.182
was a horrifying reminder
of the enemies we face.

00:57.266 --> 01:01.186
We will not allow the Soviet Union
to undermine peace and freedom

01:01.270 --> 01:04.147
on earth or in space.

01:04.230 --> 01:09.278
Let me be clear, the United States
will not be intimidated.

01:10.487 --> 01:12.948
Wish Houston would find room
on the next Sea Dragon

01:13.031 --> 01:14.324
for some new rover springs.

01:14.408 --> 01:15.993
My ass feels like a piÃ±ata.

01:16.660 --> 01:20.664
Pretty sure lithium mining gear
takes priority over your ass.

01:20.747 --> 01:23.876
Couldn't we have found the mother lode
closer to Jamestown?

01:23.959 --> 01:28.046
Quit your whining.
If the American taxpayers wanted us to--

01:28.130 --> 01:31.175
What the hell? Hey, isn't that our gear?

01:32.050 --> 01:34.178
What's it doing way up here?

01:34.261 --> 01:37.222
I don't know.
Better go have a look-see.

01:39.183 --> 01:42.269
Everybody, sit tight. Keep your eyes open.

01:42.352 --> 01:45.772
-Don, you're on me.
-Roger.

01:47.232 --> 01:50.194
Jamestown, geo crew two, come in.

01:50.861 --> 01:53.322
Geo two, Jamestown. Go ahead.

01:53.405 --> 01:56.950
We're on the south ridge above 357 Bravo,

01:57.659 --> 02:01.538
and we've got a... situation over here.

02:01.622 --> 02:03.165
What kind of situation?

02:04.082 --> 02:06.793
Goddamn Russkies took our mining site.

02:06.877 --> 02:09.213
Can you repeat that, geo two?

02:11.590 --> 02:13.383
All our transmissions are encrypted.

02:13.467 --> 02:16.345
The only way the Soviets know
about the lithium content on the site

02:16.428 --> 02:17.554
is they cracked our code.

02:17.638 --> 02:19.389
Don't we change out the encryption keys?

02:19.473 --> 02:21.475
Every month, per protocol.

02:21.558 --> 02:24.269
Apparently the Soviets
found a way around that too.

02:27.314 --> 02:28.899
I've just spoken with the president.

02:28.982 --> 02:32.986
He's decided not to bring this
to the United Nations Security Council.

02:33.570 --> 02:37.199
So, he's just gonna let the Soviets
take our mining site?

02:37.824 --> 02:42.037
No, he's not gonna do that either.
He wants us to take it back.

02:42.996 --> 02:43.997
As in--

02:44.081 --> 02:48.293
As in, go in, replace their equipment
with ours and swap out the flag again,

02:48.377 --> 02:50.629
but this time we hold it.

02:52.297 --> 02:53.423
We hold it?

02:54.007 --> 02:56.927
The National Security Council
debated every other option.

02:57.010 --> 03:01.932
But the consensus was that if the Soviets
retain control of 357 Bravo,

03:02.015 --> 03:03.809
it would set a dangerous precedent.

03:03.892 --> 03:06.687
We let this go, and then
there'll be nothing to stop Andropov

03:06.770 --> 03:09.940
from moving in and taking over
all our other lunar claims.

03:12.276 --> 03:13.902
I have to say I agree.

03:14.486 --> 03:16.864
Hundreds of man-hours
went into finding that vein,

03:16.947 --> 03:21.618
and if it's even half as rich
as these initial readings show,

03:21.702 --> 03:25.372
it could be a game changer
for our energy storage at Jamestown.

03:25.455 --> 03:28.625
Tom, just let me make sure
that I'm clear here.

03:29.293 --> 03:33.630
You're saying that the president wants us
to confront the Soviets on the moon.

03:33.714 --> 03:34.923
No, no, no. Not confront.

03:35.507 --> 03:37.759
The president's not interested
in a confrontation.

03:37.843 --> 03:39.344
But, from what we can tell,

03:39.428 --> 03:43.473
the Russians don't have the ability
to occupy the site continuously.

03:43.557 --> 03:47.144
So, when they leave for the day,
we move in.

03:47.769 --> 03:49.396
But this time we stay.

03:51.106 --> 03:55.777
We could send out a team of astronauts,
two at a time, to monitor the site.

03:56.987 --> 03:59.198
How long
can two guys stay out there?

03:59.281 --> 04:00.490
The recharge tanks on the rovers

04:00.574 --> 04:03.994
can stretch the PLSS backpacks
up to ten hours.

04:04.077 --> 04:07.456
So we could have three teams
monitoring the site round the clock.

04:08.040 --> 04:10.417
So, you guys wanna have
a permanent security detail?

04:11.376 --> 04:12.544
Essentially.

04:13.212 --> 04:18.050
And this security detail,
they're gonna need weapons, right?

04:18.634 --> 04:20.385
Weapons? Wait.

04:20.469 --> 04:23.555
No one said anything
about sending weapons to the moon.

04:25.390 --> 04:29.436
Well, forgive me, but what do you expect
these guys to do, exactly?

04:29.520 --> 04:31.104
When things get hairy, I mean.

04:31.188 --> 04:34.274
What, are they gonna ask
the Soviets to leave nicely?

04:34.858 --> 04:36.693
Maybe hit 'em over the head
with a baseball bat?

04:36.777 --> 04:38.737
Golf club, maybe?
Plenty of those up there.

04:38.820 --> 04:40.447
Wait, hold on.

04:40.531 --> 04:44.660
Are the two of you seriously suggesting
we send guns to the moon?

04:46.328 --> 04:49.414
You're telling me the president
wants us to hold that site.

04:49.498 --> 04:52.292
And I'm telling you that means
we're going to need security.

04:52.376 --> 04:53.794
And security means guns.

04:53.877 --> 04:56.630
No. That is absolutely
out of the question.

04:56.713 --> 04:59.091
-I know it seems extreme--
-It's absurd!

04:59.174 --> 05:03.220
-There's gotta be another solution.
-As in literally any other solution.

05:13.272 --> 05:17.860
What about imposing additional
economic sanctions against Moscow?

05:17.943 --> 05:19.486
An embargo?

05:19.570 --> 05:21.947
That was our response
after Berlin last year.

05:22.030 --> 05:25.576
And then the Russians just increased trade
with Latin America,

05:25.659 --> 05:30.205
which increased and strengthened
their influence in this hemisphere.

05:30.289 --> 05:32.374
And given what's going on
with Panama right now,

05:32.457 --> 05:34.751
I'd say that is the last thing we need.

05:35.586 --> 05:38.839
You can't seriously think
this is a good idea?

05:38.922 --> 05:41.341
Look, General Bradford's right.

05:41.425 --> 05:45.804
Any kind of squeeze we put on
the Soviets down here... take time.

05:46.388 --> 05:47.848
Longer we wait...

05:48.390 --> 05:50.559
the harder it's gonna be
to reclaim that site.

05:50.642 --> 05:54.563
If we could modify weapons
to be used in the lunar environment,

05:54.646 --> 05:57.316
none of our astronauts
are qualified to use them.

05:57.399 --> 05:59.985
-Marines?
-I was thinking the same thing.

06:00.068 --> 06:01.778
Thinking what, exactly?

06:02.404 --> 06:05.324
Well, every marine aviator
has to qualify as an infantry officer

06:05.407 --> 06:06.867
before they attend flight school.

06:06.950 --> 06:11.163
So, they're the only astronauts with
training in ground combat and tactics.

06:11.246 --> 06:12.247
Wait.

06:12.831 --> 06:16.293
Now we're sending marines
to the moon?

06:16.376 --> 06:18.504
Can we-- Can we do that?

06:19.546 --> 06:21.131
Well, we have to develop procedures

06:21.215 --> 06:23.592
for safety and operations
in the lunar environment.

06:24.218 --> 06:26.762
We should be able to bring them
up to speed fairly quickly.

06:26.845 --> 06:28.514
There has to be another way.

06:30.098 --> 06:33.894
Believe me, I don't like this idea
any more than the rest of you.

06:33.977 --> 06:34.978
But here's the truth.

06:35.938 --> 06:41.068
We cannot hold site 357 Bravo
without armed security.

06:41.818 --> 06:43.278
Now, I'm open to new ideas,

06:43.362 --> 06:45.364
but it seems to me
we really don't have much choice.

06:45.447 --> 06:47.449
The only way to hold
a piece of ground,

06:47.533 --> 06:49.159
on this world
or any other world,

06:49.243 --> 06:51.036
is a man with a rifle.

06:54.873 --> 06:56.208
Nelson's right.

06:57.084 --> 06:58.836
We all need to be in agreement here.

07:00.504 --> 07:02.214
'Cause once we do this thing...

07:03.465 --> 07:04.967
there's no going back.

08:26.465 --> 08:28.842
Good morning, Mrs. Cleveland.

08:28.926 --> 08:30.719
Marta, what time is it?

08:30.802 --> 08:32.095
Seven o'clock.

08:34.472 --> 08:36.140
Oh, shit.

08:37.308 --> 08:39.520
Shit! Shit!

08:41.270 --> 08:44.316
I told Sam to wake me up
before he left.

08:44.399 --> 08:47.569
I gotta be in the SIM in an hour. Christ.

08:49.363 --> 08:51.657
Marta, honey,
can you do me a favor?

08:51.740 --> 08:57.120
Can you call JSC and tell them
the car has a flat, and I'm gonna be late.

08:57.204 --> 08:58.121
Which car?

08:59.873 --> 09:01.041
You know, the car.

09:02.376 --> 09:04.586
My car. All the cars.

09:04.670 --> 09:06.171
Tell them all the cars have flats.

09:06.255 --> 09:09.258
You know what, I really don't give a shit
what you tell them,

09:09.341 --> 09:13.554
just... tell them
I'm gonna be late, all right?

09:13.637 --> 09:14.638
Yes, ma'am.

09:17.349 --> 09:19.977
You have a phone message
from Mr. Stevens.

09:21.144 --> 09:23.438
It sounded important.

09:23.522 --> 09:25.941
Oh, no, I'm sure it is important.

09:26.024 --> 09:28.986
It's always important to Gordo. Thanks.

10:00.017 --> 10:01.101
Shit.

10:10.694 --> 10:11.737
In the event--

10:14.823 --> 10:15.866
Sorry.

10:15.949 --> 10:17.993
That's all right, Captain Stevens.
Take a seat.

10:19.870 --> 10:23.874
As I was saying, a program patch
can be sent up if necessary

10:23.957 --> 10:26.126
and loaded into the GPCs.

10:26.210 --> 10:27.211
Normally after MECO...

10:27.294 --> 10:29.213
You're outta uniform, Captain.

10:29.296 --> 10:31.882
Had a little malfunction.

10:31.965 --> 10:33.133
Malfunction?

10:34.760 --> 10:35.969
The zipper broke.

10:40.307 --> 10:43.685
I'm-- I'm sure it probably
just shrank in the dryer.

10:43.769 --> 10:44.770
Very funny.

10:44.853 --> 10:48.815
...preserve engine lifetime
by minimizing the number of engine starts.

10:48.899 --> 10:54.530
For critical burns, or for large
velocity changes, both OMS pods are used.

10:54.613 --> 10:57.533
If there is a significant
main engine performance problem...

10:57.616 --> 10:59.701
You've never used a laptop before,
have you?

10:59.785 --> 11:01.286
I've used a laptop.

11:04.790 --> 11:08.877
On performance-critical missions,
an OMS assist burn during nominal ascent

11:08.961 --> 11:13.090
can add about 250 pounds
to payload capacity.

11:13.173 --> 11:16.510
In the case of a lunar mission,
the orbiter carries...

11:19.638 --> 11:23.308
And I didn't schedule any college tours
before noon on Monday.

11:23.392 --> 11:26.186
But I was thinking
that we could have breakfast

11:26.270 --> 11:27.855
and then visit Colonial Williamsburg

11:27.938 --> 11:31.400
before we head to Georgetown
and American University.

11:32.150 --> 11:35.696
So, anyway, on Tuesday, I was thinking
we could drive through Monticello--

11:35.779 --> 11:36.989
Mom?

11:38.365 --> 11:42.536
Okay, this is probably too much history.
I'm sorry.

11:42.619 --> 11:46.790
No, it all sounds really fun.
It's just... I had a suggestion.

11:47.833 --> 11:50.169
Yeah, of course, anything.
It's your trip, sweetheart.

11:50.252 --> 11:53.755
Well, I was wondering if we could go...

11:56.216 --> 11:57.342
to...

11:58.010 --> 11:59.011
Baltimore?

12:00.095 --> 12:02.181
Annapolis. The Naval Academy.

12:03.098 --> 12:04.766
Well, that-- that--

12:04.850 --> 12:08.562
that's really sweet that you wanna visit
your father's school, but--

12:09.062 --> 12:12.316
you know, it is-- it's awfully far
out of the way, and I just--

12:12.399 --> 12:14.568
I don't think we're gonna have time,
with the schedule we have, to go.

12:14.651 --> 12:16.862
I don't just wanna visit.

12:18.113 --> 12:19.364
I wanna apply there.

12:20.407 --> 12:21.408
You--

12:21.491 --> 12:24.453
You wanna apply
to the Naval Academy?

12:25.078 --> 12:28.957
Look, I know it's different from
all the schools we've been talking about,

12:29.041 --> 12:32.044
but I think it's a good fit for me.

12:32.127 --> 12:36.423
Kelly, why on earth would you
want to apply to Annapolis of all places?

12:36.507 --> 12:38.425
Look, I didn't just
come up with this, Mom.

12:38.509 --> 12:40.385
I've been thinking about it
for a long time.

12:40.469 --> 12:42.638
And this is the first
that I'm hearing about it.

12:42.721 --> 12:47.017
Kelly, it's the navy.
You wanna-- You wanna join the navy.

12:47.100 --> 12:48.268
Yes.

12:48.810 --> 12:49.811
Why?

12:50.479 --> 12:52.231
I want to serve my country.

12:52.314 --> 12:54.566
Don't. Don't give me that crap.

12:55.567 --> 12:59.780
All right? There's plenty of ways to
serve your country. You tell me why.

13:01.323 --> 13:02.366
Okay.

13:03.992 --> 13:05.410
I wanna fly.

13:06.703 --> 13:08.455
Tomcats, F-14s.

13:09.456 --> 13:10.457
It's a fighter-bomber.

13:10.541 --> 13:12.709
I know what a Tomcat is, Kelly. All right?

14:24.781 --> 14:26.491
It's open, Davey.

14:28.952 --> 14:30.829
It's not Davey.

14:31.455 --> 14:34.208
Well, come in here anyway.
I need some help.

14:34.917 --> 14:36.543
Like, now. Please.

14:38.462 --> 14:39.463
Okay.

14:40.506 --> 14:43.091
Could you grab a roll of toilet paper
from the kitchen?

14:43.175 --> 14:45.010
It's top shelf, left, above the sink.

14:55.312 --> 14:56.313
Got it.

15:04.988 --> 15:06.365
Thank you.

15:06.448 --> 15:08.408
-Sorry about that.
-No problem.

15:08.492 --> 15:10.369
So, who are ya?
What do you want?

15:12.037 --> 15:15.082
I'm looking for Aleida Rosales.

15:15.165 --> 15:16.250
Yeah, that's me.

15:17.626 --> 15:20.087
Look, if you're here to collect a bill,
I know my rights,

15:20.170 --> 15:23.048
and your entry into this vehicle
is under false pretenses.

15:23.131 --> 15:25.259
You did not identify yourself
or your intentions.

15:25.342 --> 15:27.219
Aleida, it's Margo.

16:01.170 --> 16:02.337
Hi.

16:03.422 --> 16:04.423
Hi.

16:06.675 --> 16:07.676
Hi.

16:10.971 --> 16:12.890
What are you doing here?
How did you...

16:12.973 --> 16:16.518
I got a call from your boyfriend.
Davey.

16:16.602 --> 16:18.270
Oh, my God.

16:18.353 --> 16:22.191
He told me about your... problem.

16:22.733 --> 16:23.984
Oh, my God.

16:25.027 --> 16:27.404
That was so totally inappropriate. I'm...

16:28.530 --> 16:30.782
I'm fine, okay?
This is-- This is just...

16:30.866 --> 16:33.827
He said you were gonna be deported.

16:37.164 --> 16:40.626
I... tried to call first.

16:40.709 --> 16:42.419
Yeah, phone's disconnected, I know.

16:42.503 --> 16:45.464
Power's next, then water.
Water's always the last thing to go.

16:51.762 --> 16:53.889
-Do you still play?
-Play what?

16:57.267 --> 16:58.268
No.

17:02.272 --> 17:03.315
Look, Aleida, I--

17:07.277 --> 17:10.989
I thought I knew
what I was gonna say, but now...

17:12.449 --> 17:14.952
all I wanna do is say I'm sorry--

17:15.035 --> 17:18.454
No. Don't do that. Okay?

17:20.540 --> 17:22.251
-Okay.
-"Sorry." That's not--

17:22.960 --> 17:24.752
I'm not looking for that, okay?

17:24.837 --> 17:26.839
I don't know what I'm looking for,
but it's not that.

17:26.922 --> 17:29.299
-Okay.
-What'd he tell you?

17:29.383 --> 17:30.384
Not much.

17:30.968 --> 17:35.013
Said your residency status under Reagan's
amnesty program was about to be revoked.

17:35.097 --> 17:36.348
Yup.

17:36.431 --> 17:38.308
Gotta keep a job to stick around.

17:38.392 --> 17:40.978
But people don't seem to like hiring me.
Did he tell you that?

17:41.061 --> 17:43.564
-He mentioned it.
-Yeah, 'cause I'm a bad employee.

17:43.647 --> 17:46.400
A bad coworker. A bad team player.

17:47.109 --> 17:49.236
A brilliant engineer.

17:51.280 --> 17:52.406
I made a few calls.

17:52.990 --> 17:54.408
All of your former employers,

17:54.491 --> 17:57.160
they all went out of their way
to say how gifted you were,

17:57.244 --> 18:02.207
even as they acknowledged your...
behavioral issues.

18:02.291 --> 18:05.586
Behavioral issues, right.
That's just bullshit.

18:06.670 --> 18:09.256
I didn't set fire
to McDonnell Douglas, okay?

18:09.339 --> 18:11.216
It was just a trash can
in that asshole's office,

18:11.300 --> 18:13.302
and they put it out in, like,
five seconds.

18:13.385 --> 18:14.928
I know. And that...

18:15.846 --> 18:20.058
asshole said you were the best engineer
he'd seen in the last 30 years.

18:20.142 --> 18:21.351
What do you want, Margo?

18:29.693 --> 18:30.777
I won't...

18:34.698 --> 18:38.869
I can't go back and try and explain
why I did what I did ten years ago.

18:39.536 --> 18:42.998
Thank you. 'Cause it was
humiliating enough the first time around.

18:43.582 --> 18:45.834
But I can offer you a job.

18:46.543 --> 18:47.628
At NASA.

18:49.046 --> 18:50.756
As what, a janitor?

18:50.839 --> 18:53.091
Yeah, sorry to break it to you, but
I'm not in the family business anymore.

18:53.175 --> 18:54.635
Systems engineer.

18:55.552 --> 18:57.888
You'll be working on
a fairly low-priority mission.

18:57.971 --> 19:01.141
Nothing glamorous, but...

19:01.225 --> 19:02.976
it'll give you your sea legs.

19:04.186 --> 19:05.812
And it'll keep you in the country.

19:09.358 --> 19:10.567
Poor Aleida.

19:10.651 --> 19:13.070
This is not charity.

19:13.153 --> 19:14.905
Poor little Mexican girl.

19:14.988 --> 19:18.242
You know, she got a big job at NASA
'cause Margo Madison took pity on her.

19:18.325 --> 19:21.286
-I didn't come here out of pity.
-Guilt's a close cousin.

19:21.370 --> 19:23.705
You're an engineer, and we need engineers.

19:23.789 --> 19:25.290
Rationalization.

19:25.374 --> 19:27.167
You were closer with guilt.

19:27.251 --> 19:29.837
I do have guilt over what happened.
I have for a long time.

19:29.920 --> 19:32.005
But that's my problem, not yours.

19:32.089 --> 19:36.718
Your problem is your residency status.
I'm offering you a way to deal with it.

19:36.802 --> 19:39.304
It doesn't make up
for what happened back then...

19:41.682 --> 19:44.059
but it's a way out. Today.

19:49.273 --> 19:53.569
If you want the job,
report to the personnel office at JSC.

19:58.866 --> 20:01.076
Think you know which building it's in.

20:06.874 --> 20:09.543
If you wanna cut off your nose
to spite your face,

20:09.626 --> 20:12.045
then fine, be that way.

20:13.422 --> 20:15.716
All I can do is offer you the job.

20:15.799 --> 20:17.968
There's nothing else that I can do.

20:18.051 --> 20:22.681
I gave you the opportunity,
and if you don't want it, then fine.

20:22.764 --> 20:25.392
Be a brat. Be stubborn.

20:36.486 --> 20:37.946
I...

20:39.573 --> 20:41.617
Look, all I'm saying is,

20:42.451 --> 20:47.664
Jamestown learns about
the high lithium content at 357 Bravo,

20:47.748 --> 20:50.417
and within two days
the Russians take over the site.

20:51.460 --> 20:55.464
In your report, you stated that after you
launched to rescue Commander Wilson,

20:55.547 --> 20:58.926
Cosmonaut Vasiliev
remained at Jamestown. Alone.

20:59.009 --> 21:03.472
Now, either our cryptography is more
vulnerable than we ever suspected, or...

21:04.765 --> 21:06.558
maybe they got ears inside our base.

21:06.642 --> 21:09.061
-You think maybe he'd plant a device?
-No.

21:09.686 --> 21:12.814
No, there wasn't enough time.
It all happened so fast.

21:12.898 --> 21:15.359
You were in an emotionally
vulnerable place.

21:15.442 --> 21:18.820
And God knows you had every right to be.
You'd just lost a son.

21:19.530 --> 21:21.865
You hadn't slept or eaten for days.

21:21.949 --> 21:24.743
You had stacks of unanswered communiquÃ©s.

21:24.826 --> 21:27.871
Now, surely all of this
was visible to him.

21:27.955 --> 21:30.666
So all I'm asking you is,

21:30.749 --> 21:34.586
don't you think that there is
the slightest chance that maybe,

21:34.670 --> 21:36.296
just maybe...

21:37.381 --> 21:39.299
our enemies might've
taken advantage of that?

21:49.810 --> 21:54.022
Alex, can we get a status check
on that systems diagnostic?

21:54.106 --> 21:55.899
Any abnormalities so far?

21:57.734 --> 21:59.027
That's a negative, Houston.

21:59.111 --> 22:02.489
-So far everything checks out.
-Copy that.

22:03.615 --> 22:07.327
Hey, we're sending
a new shipment of movies up this month.

22:07.411 --> 22:10.205
-Anything you're interested in?
-Never thought you'd ask.

22:13.166 --> 22:16.003
Matter of fact,
we're all a little bummed up here.

22:16.086 --> 22:19.089
We're not gonna be on earth
when that Mercury 7 movie comes out.

22:19.173 --> 22:20.174
The Right Stuff.

22:20.257 --> 22:21.842
They made a movie out of that?

22:21.925 --> 22:23.427
Yeah. Looks decent too.

22:23.510 --> 22:25.512
Think we can get an advanced copy
up here?

22:25.596 --> 22:26.889
I'll see what we can do.

22:42.905 --> 22:45.199
Hey, Alex, one more thing.

22:45.282 --> 22:50.204
Have you had any trouble with any minor
systems since we scrammed the reactor?

22:50.287 --> 22:52.206
We got a heads-up from HAB SYS

22:52.289 --> 22:56.084
that you might start experiencing
some efficiency issues

22:56.585 --> 22:58.337
with the overhead lights.

23:39.461 --> 23:43.173
It's an affirm, Houston.
Lights have been a little finicky lately.

23:44.842 --> 23:48.053
Roger that. We'll look into it.
Houston out.

23:50.764 --> 23:53.642
Yes, Mr. President, budget's on track,

23:53.725 --> 23:56.353
launch schedule at Vandenberg
shaping up nicely.

23:56.436 --> 23:58.647
Oh, and one more thing,

23:58.730 --> 24:03.110
the Soviets have had ears on our base
for the last nine years.

24:04.695 --> 24:08.949
If you'll excuse me, I have
a very unpleasant phone call to make.

24:21.712 --> 24:22.796
Hey.

24:22.880 --> 24:24.631
Hi. How's it going?

24:25.174 --> 24:28.051
You know. Same old, same old.

24:32.181 --> 24:33.182
What'll you have?

24:37.644 --> 24:38.979
Bourbon on the rocks.

24:43.025 --> 24:45.861
So, that's it? That's all I get?
"What'll you have?"

24:45.944 --> 24:48.030
-What?
-My...

24:49.072 --> 24:51.950
-Oh, my goodness! Tracy!
-All right, there she is.

24:52.034 --> 24:56.163
-I'm sorry, I forgot! I'm sorry.
-Okay, thank God! I was wondering.

24:56.246 --> 24:57.915
-Congratulations!
-Thank you.

24:57.998 --> 24:59.374
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

24:59.458 --> 25:04.004
Okay, let's see--
let's see this ring. Holy...

25:05.088 --> 25:06.381
-Oh, my goodness!
-Yeah.

25:06.965 --> 25:09.343
-What?
-I know! He did good.

25:09.927 --> 25:12.346
And you two together, that's...

25:13.514 --> 25:14.640
that's really incredible.

25:14.723 --> 25:17.142
-It is amazing, I mean...
-Cheers to that.

25:17.226 --> 25:19.436
I'm over the moon, just like they say.

25:21.939 --> 25:24.233
You deserve it. Cheers.

25:24.316 --> 25:25.859
Thank you.

25:27.069 --> 25:28.111
You know,

25:28.195 --> 25:30.489
you're one of the few people
that actually seem happy for me.

25:30.572 --> 25:32.908
-Come on, that can't be true.
-Oh, my God.

25:32.991 --> 25:35.577
I'm getting the stink eye all over JSC.

25:35.661 --> 25:38.705
It's like I needed Gordo's approval
or something.

25:38.789 --> 25:40.916
Have you talked to him recently?

25:42.876 --> 25:43.919
What's going on?

25:44.002 --> 25:46.255
No, Tracy. Not my place, I'm...

25:46.338 --> 25:48.257
All right, all right.
Well, enough about him.

25:48.340 --> 25:49.466
What's going on with you?

25:49.550 --> 25:51.593
When I came in here,
you were a million miles away.

25:53.345 --> 25:55.722
Kelly told me
she wants to go to Annapolis.

26:00.811 --> 26:04.231
I mean, I don't know. I still feel
like I'm in shock about it all.

26:05.023 --> 26:07.568
And I feel like
I'm in shock that I'm in shock.

26:07.651 --> 26:10.612
Like, I should've seen this coming.

26:10.696 --> 26:13.490
-I mean, she grew up around Ed.
-Yeah.

26:13.574 --> 26:16.243
And his job. And of course
that's what she would wanna do.

26:16.326 --> 26:20.622
She grew up in this place,
and she had... you.

26:21.540 --> 26:22.624
You know, honestly.

26:22.708 --> 26:27.796
Hey, you've inspired
a lot of young women, Tracy.

26:27.880 --> 26:30.257
And it's really incredible,
and you should be proud of that.

26:30.340 --> 26:31.842
You know, I just...

26:33.051 --> 26:35.429
I just-- I don't want that life
for my daughter.

26:35.512 --> 26:36.763
Yeah, I get it.

26:40.184 --> 26:42.686
So-- So what'd you tell her?

26:45.063 --> 26:47.774
I just shut her down and said
we weren't gonna talk about it, you know?

26:47.858 --> 26:49.735
'Cause that's what great moms do.

26:50.319 --> 26:52.863
Hey, you know what,
cut yourself some slack, all right?

26:53.864 --> 26:56.950
Your daughter just told you
that she wanted to join the navy.

26:57.034 --> 27:00.662
I mean, that is a big deal.

27:03.498 --> 27:06.835
I mean, hell, when I told my mama
I wanted to learn how to fly,

27:06.919 --> 27:08.545
she didn't speak to me for months.

27:08.629 --> 27:10.088
And you hated her for it, right?

27:10.172 --> 27:13.217
I got over it. And I had my brother
teach me for 25 bucks.

27:14.259 --> 27:17.095
But you know what, that's who I was.
That's who I am.

27:17.179 --> 27:18.972
No one was gonna tell me any differently.

27:19.723 --> 27:21.391
That's kinda my point, Karen.

27:21.975 --> 27:24.478
If Kelly really wants to do this,
she is gonna do it.

27:24.561 --> 27:26.939
She's gonna find a way to do it,
with or without you.

27:27.022 --> 27:28.065
So, you know...

27:29.483 --> 27:31.944
you might wanna start
making peace with it now.

27:35.989 --> 27:38.492
I don't--
I don't know how to do that, Tracy.

27:39.243 --> 27:40.619
I don't. Every time I think about it,

27:40.702 --> 27:45.165
I think if something happens to her,
I don't feel like I can survive that.

27:45.249 --> 27:47.793
-I just-- I can't. I can't do that.
-I know.

27:48.710 --> 27:49.753
The way I see it...

27:51.338 --> 27:54.132
we're the ones that brought them up
in this fucked-up world.

27:55.759 --> 28:00.764
Least we can do is...
let them go live in it.

28:04.643 --> 28:06.186
We owe them that much.

28:08.772 --> 28:09.857
Yeah, we do.

28:34.798 --> 28:36.175
Yeah?

28:36.258 --> 28:37.384
Gordo?

28:38.594 --> 28:39.595
Trace?

28:41.346 --> 28:43.056
You left a message.

28:43.140 --> 28:45.851
Yeah. Yeah, that's right.

28:47.311 --> 28:51.106
I had something
that I wanted to talk to you about.

28:52.524 --> 28:54.735
She keeps staring at me.

28:54.818 --> 28:56.486
What? Who?

28:57.988 --> 28:59.114
Me.

29:00.282 --> 29:01.366
Okay.

29:02.201 --> 29:05.787
I came around the curve,
and it was like...

29:06.747 --> 29:08.290
I just appeared.

29:10.042 --> 29:12.878
You're not really
making a whole lot of sense, Trace.

29:15.506 --> 29:16.507
You okay?

29:16.590 --> 29:20.093
Yeah. I just--
I got in a little bit of a car accident.

29:20.177 --> 29:21.178
Jesus.

29:21.261 --> 29:23.138
I'm fine. Fine.

29:23.222 --> 29:24.765
Car is fucked though.

29:24.848 --> 29:27.851
-Not your Porsche.
-Yup, that's the one.

29:31.104 --> 29:32.523
Come pick me up.

29:34.858 --> 29:36.985
It's, like, two o'clock in the morning.

29:37.569 --> 29:41.615
Wait a minute. Why don't you get
your husband to come and get you, Trace?

29:41.698 --> 29:44.284
He's outta town for work.

29:44.368 --> 29:45.536
Can you just--

29:47.037 --> 29:48.664
Can you just do me this favor and--

29:48.747 --> 29:50.415
and come and get me, Gordo?

29:57.422 --> 29:59.299
What should I do about the car?

30:00.551 --> 30:02.177
Sure Sam will buy you a new one.

30:02.761 --> 30:05.889
Sam. He's such a good guy.

30:05.973 --> 30:08.433
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

30:09.268 --> 30:14.147
He has a bit of a temper, but, you know,
you really gotta push him.

30:14.231 --> 30:15.440
You know what I mean?

30:16.233 --> 30:17.651
He's not like you.

30:18.777 --> 30:19.987
You're easy.

30:20.821 --> 30:24.408
-Yeah. I'm easy.
-Yeah.

30:27.411 --> 30:29.204
Oh, no, no, no.

30:29.288 --> 30:30.289
Don't-- Don't--

30:30.372 --> 30:32.040
-Don't take me back to my house.
-What?

30:32.124 --> 30:34.793
-Take me-- Take me to our old place.
-Why?

30:35.502 --> 30:40.215
I'm sick of the staff treating me
like some teenager coming in past curfew.

30:45.846 --> 30:47.472
Gordo. Pull over.

30:48.265 --> 30:49.641
-What?
-Gordo!

30:59.026 --> 31:00.152
Yeah.

31:03.363 --> 31:04.406
All right.

31:07.284 --> 31:08.577
Here we go.

31:10.871 --> 31:12.331
Boys are both home tonight,

31:12.414 --> 31:15.959
so gonna have to sack it out
on the couch, all right?

31:33.185 --> 31:34.186
Trace?

31:45.489 --> 31:46.990
Shit.

32:14.017 --> 32:16.436
I guess I'll take the couch.

32:27.322 --> 32:29.867
Well, I had to do something.

32:30.450 --> 32:32.494
Couldn't just let them
haul you off to Mexico.

32:32.578 --> 32:35.581
So you decided to call the one person
you knew I didn't wanna call.

32:35.664 --> 32:38.125
The one person I never wanted
to ask a favor of. Ever.

32:38.208 --> 32:41.420
I'm sorry. I didn't wanna lose you.

32:42.004 --> 32:44.548
I guess I panicked.
It was the only thing I could think of.

32:44.631 --> 32:48.177
Really? You didn't think to call
a temp agency? Or Bruce? Or--

32:48.260 --> 32:49.845
Bruce? My boss?

32:49.928 --> 32:51.889
Yeah, you said he needed some help.

32:51.972 --> 32:56.560
Okay. So, you'd rather work on
an oil rig than be an engineer at NASA?

33:00.731 --> 33:02.274
And what if I fuck it up?

33:04.818 --> 33:06.987
-Why would you fuck it up?
-Because I'm a fuckup.

33:07.946 --> 33:09.865
I've been fired
from every job I've ever had.

33:09.948 --> 33:11.533
Boeing, Abbott, McDonnell Douglas.

33:11.617 --> 33:13.243
But this is NASA.

33:13.327 --> 33:15.746
You've dreamed about working here
since you were a little kid.

33:15.829 --> 33:17.956
So why ruin it by letting them tell me
I'm a piece of shit,

33:18.040 --> 33:19.208
just like everywhere else?

33:19.291 --> 33:20.751
Oh, come on.

33:20.834 --> 33:23.629
I mean, you really think Margo Madison
would come all the way down here

33:23.712 --> 33:24.713
and offer you a job

33:24.796 --> 33:26.715
if she didn't think you could cut it?

33:26.798 --> 33:29.009
She knows how talented you are.

33:29.635 --> 33:31.261
And so do I.

33:31.345 --> 33:34.556
I mean...
you were born to do this, babe.

33:34.640 --> 33:35.641
You know you were--

33:35.724 --> 33:38.310
Okay, okay. Shut up already.

33:43.440 --> 33:44.566
I'll do it.

33:45.817 --> 33:46.818
Really?

33:48.946 --> 33:51.573
-I'm so happy for you, babe!
-No.

33:52.491 --> 33:54.159
What-- What do you mean, "no"?

33:55.494 --> 33:56.745
We're done, Davey.

33:56.828 --> 33:57.871
I'm sorry, you're--

34:01.166 --> 34:03.836
-Are you breaking up with me?
-Yeah, I am.

34:04.837 --> 34:06.380
But you're taking the job.

34:07.089 --> 34:09.007
Your dream job, that I helped you get.

34:09.091 --> 34:10.967
-By going behind my back.
-I was just--

34:11.051 --> 34:15.806
Okay, look... look,
I know you're upset.

34:15.889 --> 34:18.766
I was humiliated
in front of that woman again.

34:18.851 --> 34:20.686
Something I swore
I would never let happen.

34:20.768 --> 34:23.772
And then it did... because of you.

34:24.481 --> 34:25.774
I'm not getting over that.

34:27.192 --> 34:28.193
Ever.

34:30.487 --> 34:31.989
Your shit's in the box.

34:33.072 --> 34:34.324
Take it and don't come back.

35:42.226 --> 35:44.061
An American.

35:44.144 --> 35:46.230
-This is America!
-Shut up!

35:49.733 --> 35:52.528
You were in an emotional,
vulnerable place.

35:54.238 --> 35:57.824
Surely all of this
was clearly visible to him.

35:59.701 --> 36:01.828
And God knows you had every right to be.

36:01.912 --> 36:02.913
You'd just lost a son.

36:06.333 --> 36:07.918
...vulnerable place.

37:17.779 --> 37:20.616
Gordo, the taxi's on its way, so...

37:22.993 --> 37:24.077
Hey, Gordo.

37:28.373 --> 37:29.499
Morning.

37:29.583 --> 37:34.796
Morning. I'm looking for
my keys to the house and...

37:35.547 --> 37:36.798
can't find them.

37:37.966 --> 37:41.512
Oh, shit. I hope I didn't lose them
in the field, or in the car.

37:41.595 --> 37:43.388
Nah, you didn't leave 'em.

37:44.806 --> 37:45.807
I took them.

37:45.891 --> 37:46.934
You what?

37:47.017 --> 37:49.186
I took the keys to this place
off your key ring.

37:49.269 --> 37:52.356
Okay, look, I don't have time
to do this right now.

37:52.439 --> 37:54.066
Can you just give me back
my keys, please?

37:54.149 --> 37:56.068
Believe me, I would,

37:56.151 --> 37:58.487
but last time I checked,
they fit these locks.

37:58.570 --> 38:00.155
And these locks
are attached to this house.

38:00.239 --> 38:01.740
And this house is attached to my name.

38:01.823 --> 38:06.370
-So technically they're my keys.
-Nah, the house is under our name.

38:06.453 --> 38:07.454
That's another thing.

38:07.538 --> 38:10.040
Aren't you supposed to change that
when you get remarried?

38:10.749 --> 38:13.001
Why are you still Tracy Stevens?

38:13.085 --> 38:16.672
'Cause I'm a public figure now, Gordo.
People just know me as Stevens.

38:16.755 --> 38:18.507
Right.

38:18.590 --> 38:20.259
Astronaut Tracy Cleveland.

38:20.342 --> 38:22.845
Yeah, guess it doesn't have
quite the same ring.

38:22.928 --> 38:25.764
You know what? I don't know what
the hell's gotten into you this morning.

38:25.848 --> 38:27.933
Just give me my goddamn keys. Please.

38:28.016 --> 38:29.393
You don't live here, Trace.

38:29.476 --> 38:31.144
My children live here, Gordo.

38:31.228 --> 38:33.230
And you can come and see 'em
anytime you want.

38:33.313 --> 38:34.982
All you gotta do is pick up the phone.

38:35.065 --> 38:37.734
Is that what this is about?
Me not returning your call?

38:37.818 --> 38:38.819
No, it's not.

38:38.902 --> 38:40.112
But I'm glad you brought that up,

38:40.195 --> 38:42.906
because I do have something to tell you
that I thought you might wanna know.

38:42.990 --> 38:44.700
All right, let me have it.

38:48.245 --> 38:49.496
I'm going back to the moon.

38:55.460 --> 38:58.213
You? Back to the moon?

38:58.297 --> 38:59.339
That's right.

38:59.423 --> 39:02.467
Decided it was time to get my shit
together and get back on the horse.

39:03.135 --> 39:04.720
Just like that.

39:04.803 --> 39:06.513
Just like that.

39:06.597 --> 39:08.640
Ed put me back in training
for Jamestown 91.

39:08.724 --> 39:09.725
Good for you.

39:09.808 --> 39:11.977
Columbia will be taking me back
in September.

39:12.060 --> 39:13.061
September?

39:13.145 --> 39:14.146
Yeah.

39:14.813 --> 39:18.817
Well, I'm going to the moon
in a couple weeks on Discovery.

39:18.901 --> 39:20.986
I'll still be there in September.

39:21.069 --> 39:22.237
That's why I called.

39:23.655 --> 39:25.532
See, I wanted you to hear it from me.

39:26.575 --> 39:28.952
Not with the rest of the world
on some television show.

39:29.036 --> 39:30.829
-Television?
-Yeah.

39:31.371 --> 39:33.540
Does NASA Public Affairs know about this?

39:33.624 --> 39:35.876
No idea. Probably.

39:35.959 --> 39:38.086
Oh, God damn it.

39:38.170 --> 39:41.256
I am not doing
the "space couple" bullshit again.

39:41.340 --> 39:43.550
All right?
Not after all I've accomplished.

39:43.634 --> 39:45.886
That's your reaction?
You're worried about publicity?

39:45.969 --> 39:48.430
I'm not gonna play the "astro-wife," okay?

39:48.514 --> 39:52.309
And Ed-- Of course.
Ed just smiles and says, "That's fine."

39:52.392 --> 39:55.354
You know what?
He's in for a rude awakening, Gordo.

39:55.437 --> 39:57.814
I'm going back to space
after ten years, Trace.

39:57.898 --> 40:00.567
All you can think of
is how it affects your press clippings?

40:02.945 --> 40:06.740
-This is bullshit! It's absolute bullshit.
-All right, settle down now.

40:06.823 --> 40:10.410
I will not have everything I've worked for
be made into some kind of joke.

40:10.494 --> 40:11.620
What is this?

40:11.703 --> 40:15.082
"Tracy and Gordo finally on the moon
together, after all these years?"

40:15.165 --> 40:17.251
I won't have it, Ed. I will not.

40:17.334 --> 40:19.753
Look, no one is talking about
any of that stuff.

40:19.837 --> 40:21.338
Don't treat me like a child.

40:21.421 --> 40:23.590
I know how things work around here.

40:23.674 --> 40:27.010
Gordo comes crying to you
about some flight assignment,

40:27.094 --> 40:31.098
and you figure, why not throw a pity party
for my friend on the moon

40:31.181 --> 40:33.934
while giving Shorty Powers
his wet dream at the same time?

40:34.017 --> 40:36.979
I make crew decisions based on
what I think is best for this program.

40:37.062 --> 40:39.773
Bullshit. You make crew decisions
based on your golf score

40:39.857 --> 40:41.775
and how big a dump you took that day.

40:41.859 --> 40:43.694
You're way outta line.

40:43.777 --> 40:46.613
I will not be made a laughingstock
in front of the entire world

40:46.697 --> 40:48.031
as "astro-wife" again.

40:48.115 --> 40:50.993
This has nothing to do--

40:51.076 --> 40:53.328
Bounce him off the flight, Ed.

40:53.412 --> 40:55.289
Just bounce him off the flight!

40:55.998 --> 40:56.999
All right?

40:57.541 --> 41:01.170
He has been a washed-up has-been
for the last ten years.

41:01.253 --> 41:04.798
It will not kill him
if he doesn't go on for two more months.

41:06.550 --> 41:08.385
Gordo's flight is set.

41:09.553 --> 41:10.596
End of story.

41:12.514 --> 41:15.684
You want off your flight,
just say the word, Trace.

41:15.767 --> 41:17.311
Just say the word.

41:17.394 --> 41:19.688
But don't expect to get another slot
for a good long time.

41:19.771 --> 41:21.106
Not while I'm running this office.

41:23.609 --> 41:25.319
Boys will be boys, huh?

41:26.528 --> 41:28.906
Y'all just stick together
no matter what, don't you?

41:29.531 --> 41:30.824
In or out, Trace?

41:33.619 --> 41:34.995
I'm in, Ed.

41:36.330 --> 41:37.623
I'm always in.

42:19.831 --> 42:20.958
Kelly?

42:24.711 --> 42:26.755
Hi. You... got a minute?

42:28.298 --> 42:29.299
Sure.

42:33.929 --> 42:35.138
Everything okay?

42:37.140 --> 42:38.141
Yeah.

42:40.936 --> 42:43.355
Kelly, I need you to tell me--

42:44.022 --> 42:49.361
I want you to tell me
that this is really what you want.

42:49.444 --> 42:53.115
Yes. It's really what I want.

42:55.325 --> 42:56.827
And it's not a whim?

42:57.870 --> 43:00.622
Or because Danny Stevens looks cute
in his uniform--

43:00.706 --> 43:02.583
Mom, no.

43:02.666 --> 43:04.626
It's something I've wanted for a while.

43:05.210 --> 43:07.296
Ever since we've been
talking about it, I just...

43:07.379 --> 43:11.466
realize I don't wanna be stuck in some
library writing essays for four years.

43:12.050 --> 43:14.469
Okay? I wanna--
I wanna do something with my life.

43:14.553 --> 43:16.430
I wanna make a difference
in the world.

43:17.306 --> 43:18.515
Like Dad.

43:19.850 --> 43:20.851
He's...

43:24.855 --> 43:26.190
He's...

43:26.273 --> 43:27.649
Yeah.

43:32.279 --> 43:33.822
Trust me, I know.

43:35.908 --> 43:41.121
I've lived with Ed Baldwin
for many years, you know.

43:44.416 --> 43:49.046
But he's paid a heavy toll though,
for being Ed Baldwin.

43:51.298 --> 43:52.799
It's not a normal life.

43:53.967 --> 43:57.012
It is a lot of stress.

43:58.096 --> 44:00.891
And exhaustion. And danger.

44:01.475 --> 44:04.937
You know, he missed
a lot of things too. He did.

44:05.020 --> 44:10.234
He missed time... with--
time with me and time with--

44:13.987 --> 44:16.365
He just-- He-- He missed a lot.

44:19.243 --> 44:20.285
Like Shane?

44:25.332 --> 44:26.333
Yes.

44:28.794 --> 44:30.712
He missed a lot of time with Shane.

44:46.103 --> 44:47.563
Where-- Where did you find this?

44:48.814 --> 44:52.192
Back there. Just before you came in.

44:53.944 --> 44:55.529
This was his favorite.

44:57.155 --> 44:58.282
Popeye.

44:58.949 --> 45:01.702
I always knew this was his room.

45:03.829 --> 45:06.915
And sometimes
I thought he was listening to me.

45:07.791 --> 45:11.378
Not in a bad way or anything,
just a presence.

45:12.629 --> 45:13.672
It sounds dumb.

45:13.755 --> 45:15.257
No, it doesn't.

45:15.883 --> 45:17.759
I used to think the same thing.

45:19.219 --> 45:23.390
I did. You know, it was so hard
to come in here at first.

45:24.558 --> 45:28.312
And we thought about selling the house
and moving away, and...

45:31.106 --> 45:32.524
and then you came along.

45:35.319 --> 45:37.446
And everything was different.

45:37.529 --> 45:41.491
Like it was okay
now that there was life in here again.

45:48.749 --> 45:49.750
Okay.

45:51.793 --> 45:54.505
Okay. Annapolis.

45:55.839 --> 45:58.675
-Let's do it.
-Really? Are you sure?

45:58.759 --> 46:00.636
You're gonna take ten years off my life.

46:01.553 --> 46:05.307
But your father's gonna get a kick
out of the football games, so it's--

46:05.390 --> 46:07.809
Thank you! Thank you!

46:11.772 --> 46:13.023
I love you.

46:34.461 --> 46:35.712
But I loved them.

46:37.422 --> 46:38.882
-Looking forward to that.
-Hello.

46:39.842 --> 46:41.677
-Hi!
-Hi, Dad.

46:42.678 --> 46:43.762
Long day?

46:44.805 --> 46:46.014
Got off to a bad start.

46:46.098 --> 46:49.434
But what is this?
An actual dinner at home?

46:50.352 --> 46:51.478
-Yeah.
-Special occasion?

46:51.562 --> 46:53.272
Well, you could say that.

46:53.355 --> 46:55.524
Your daughter decided
on her number one school.

46:59.528 --> 47:02.614
From your mood,
I'm guessing William & Mary?

47:03.365 --> 47:06.326
No, actually.
But that is still on the list, right?

47:06.410 --> 47:08.704
Definitely. Just not number one.

47:11.707 --> 47:13.792
You gonna keep me
in suspense here or what?

47:13.876 --> 47:15.127
Tell him.

47:18.422 --> 47:20.007
The Naval Academy.

47:20.090 --> 47:21.925
Very funny. Come on, tell me.

47:22.551 --> 47:23.844
Really.

47:23.927 --> 47:25.429
It's Annapolis.

47:36.023 --> 47:37.024
No.

47:37.608 --> 47:39.443
What? Why?

47:40.027 --> 47:41.403
Because I said you're not going.

47:41.486 --> 47:43.697
That's not a reason.
Can't we at least discuss this?

47:43.780 --> 47:45.949
-Go to your room.
-Go to my room?

47:46.033 --> 47:47.451
No, Ed, she's not a child, okay?

47:47.534 --> 47:49.745
Look, this isn't up for debate.
The answer's no!

47:49.828 --> 47:51.622
Dad, I get to have some say in this.

47:51.705 --> 47:55.501
I said no! Okay, we're done here!
End of story!

47:55.584 --> 47:58.504
-Edward, you need to stop right there.
-What was that?

47:58.587 --> 48:00.380
Since when
do we not talk about things?

48:00.464 --> 48:02.674
Just stop right now, all right?
We need to talk about this as a family.

48:02.758 --> 48:03.926
This is not happening!

48:04.009 --> 48:06.470
-We thought you would be happy about this.
-Yeah? Well, you were wrong!

48:06.553 --> 48:08.305
Dad, this is my life we're talking about.

48:08.388 --> 48:10.432
Well, you're still living
under my roof, young lady.

48:10.516 --> 48:12.100
-What the hell does that mean?
-Hey, watch your mouth!

48:12.184 --> 48:13.852
Hey, Ed, watch your tone
right now, all right?

48:13.936 --> 48:15.103
I don't know what has gotten into you.

48:15.187 --> 48:18.232
I'm the head of this house, and I don't
need to explain myself to either of you!

48:18.315 --> 48:21.235
This is my decision, not yours!
I don't need your permission to apply!

48:21.318 --> 48:23.862
I just so happen to know
the superintendent of the academy,

48:23.946 --> 48:25.405
and if I just pick up that phone,

48:25.489 --> 48:29.034
I guarantee you that application
will never see the light of day!

48:29.117 --> 48:30.494
This is outrageous, all right?
You can't do that!

48:30.577 --> 48:31.703
I can, and I will!

48:31.787 --> 48:32.913
Great! Then you know what?

48:32.996 --> 48:36.333
I'm just gonna go down to the recruiting
office, and I'll join the navy!

48:36.416 --> 48:39.336
A couple years go by, and I'll apply
to Annapolis as an enlisted sailor.

48:39.419 --> 48:41.922
Fine. Then pack your bags
and don't come back!

48:42.005 --> 48:44.716
Hey! Don't you say that!
You take that back! Right now!

48:44.800 --> 48:48.929
I don't know what the fuck has gotten into
you! God damn it! Don't fucking say that!

48:49.012 --> 48:51.807
Stop! Everybody just stop! Enough!

49:07.698 --> 49:09.950
Now, whatever that was,
we're not doing it anymore.

49:10.951 --> 49:11.952
Okay.

49:13.412 --> 49:14.413
Okay?

49:14.496 --> 49:16.039
Okay.

49:16.123 --> 49:18.375
-Okay. Okay.
-Okay.

49:22.171 --> 49:24.089
Oh, no. I'm sorry, I...

49:25.716 --> 49:28.719
I don't know why I said that.
I don't want you to leave.

49:29.428 --> 49:31.555
No, we don't. We--
Please don't leave.

49:31.638 --> 49:34.766
I'm not. I'm not going anywhere, Mom.

49:36.226 --> 49:38.478
It's all right. It's gonna be all right.

49:39.229 --> 49:41.273
No one is going anywhere.

49:41.356 --> 49:45.360
Okay, what we're gonna do is calm down
and talk about what's going on.

49:47.279 --> 49:48.572
Dad.

49:49.281 --> 49:50.782
What was that all about?

49:52.201 --> 49:55.621
I-- I don't know. I just...

49:56.830 --> 49:59.708
I just... suddenly reacted.

50:05.881 --> 50:07.674
I thought you'd be proud of me.

50:07.758 --> 50:10.636
I should. I would, of course.
Of course I would.

50:10.719 --> 50:13.388
I just-- It wasn't...

50:13.931 --> 50:16.183
That's not what-- It's just not--

50:16.266 --> 50:19.478
Ed, whatever it is, say it.

50:21.230 --> 50:22.731
I just got this...

50:26.318 --> 50:28.237
sudden, overwhelming...

50:29.571 --> 50:31.573
feeling, like I was...

50:34.660 --> 50:36.286
gonna lose you.

50:37.246 --> 50:40.749
Dad, you're not losing me.
It's just college. I can always--

50:40.832 --> 50:43.335
No, I don't...

50:43.418 --> 50:46.505
mean like that. I meant...

50:50.050 --> 50:51.468
lose you like...

50:56.473 --> 50:57.474
Like Shane.

50:59.309 --> 51:00.394
Yeah.

51:03.730 --> 51:05.148
Like Shane.

51:18.161 --> 51:19.162
Hey.

51:22.207 --> 51:24.042
I know. I had the same feeling.

51:25.627 --> 51:26.628
I did, Ed.

51:28.130 --> 51:31.508
But Shane died because
he was riding his bike down a street.

51:34.052 --> 51:36.346
There's no safe place on this earth.

51:36.430 --> 51:40.642
I know, but that's the point.
'Cause I wasn't on this earth.

51:43.854 --> 51:46.231
I wasn't here when it happened.
I was gone.

51:49.151 --> 51:52.404
I wasn't here for him.
I wasn't here for you. I--

51:53.322 --> 51:56.867
I couldn't protect you.
Couldn't-- Couldn't do anything.

51:57.367 --> 52:02.247
Except for curl up in my bunk
and scream into the night.

52:04.750 --> 52:06.126
And I...

52:06.210 --> 52:10.047
I promised myself that I would
never let that happen again.

52:10.130 --> 52:11.381
I...

52:11.465 --> 52:13.759
I was always gonna be there
for you and Kelly.

52:14.801 --> 52:17.804
No matter what the cost,
no matter what I had to give up,

52:18.680 --> 52:21.433
this time I was gonna stay...

52:24.311 --> 52:25.646
and protect you both.

52:31.276 --> 52:32.319
Ed...

52:33.904 --> 52:36.323
Ed, do you think it was your fault?

52:42.746 --> 52:43.747
Look at me.

52:47.918 --> 52:48.919
Do you?

52:50.629 --> 52:54.383
He was angry with me.
And I wasn't there.

52:54.466 --> 52:58.303
No. Hey, no. No, no, no.

52:59.137 --> 53:01.098
It was an accident.

53:03.058 --> 53:06.228
Okay? An accident.

53:12.943 --> 53:17.823
I can't tell you how many nights
I laid in bed going over that day,

53:17.906 --> 53:20.492
wondering, if I had done
something different...

53:21.910 --> 53:23.245
you know, maybe...

53:25.747 --> 53:27.374
But you can't do that.

53:28.125 --> 53:30.502
You can't, because it's torture.

53:31.587 --> 53:32.838
That's what it is.

53:33.380 --> 53:35.966
It's a way of punishing ourselves,
hoping that...

53:37.259 --> 53:41.096
you know, after enough torture,
something good will come out of it.

53:41.972 --> 53:43.182
Like penance.

53:43.265 --> 53:47.186
You know, if you say enough Hail Marys,
your sins will be washed away and--

53:48.103 --> 53:51.064
you know, enough penance
and maybe you'll finally pay God's price

53:51.148 --> 53:52.649
for bringing Shane back.

53:55.903 --> 53:57.321
But that's not true.

53:59.865 --> 54:01.450
He's not coming back.

54:05.370 --> 54:09.750
And his death... was not my fault.

54:12.002 --> 54:13.837
And it was not yours either.

54:16.548 --> 54:17.799
Okay?

54:23.514 --> 54:24.681
It wasn't your fault.

54:36.610 --> 54:37.903
Come here.

54:55.796 --> 54:56.797
Popeye?

54:59.508 --> 55:00.843
I found it.

55:02.719 --> 55:03.929
Today.

55:07.474 --> 55:08.934
You're kidding?

55:13.397 --> 55:18.819
I remember when you told me that
you wanted to join the Naval Academy.

55:20.946 --> 55:23.407
I thought, "What the hell
is a boy from Gary, Indiana,

55:23.490 --> 55:26.702
who's never seen the ocean,
gonna do in the navy? That's crazy."

55:29.788 --> 55:32.291
The next thing I knew,
you were in the navy.

55:32.374 --> 55:34.168
And I was in the navy.

55:35.335 --> 55:38.505
And our son wanted to be in the navy.

55:41.508 --> 55:44.636
And now it turns out our daughter
wants to be in the navy too.

55:46.763 --> 55:48.473
We are the Baldwins.

55:50.225 --> 55:53.812
You cut us, and we're gonna bleed
blue and fucking gold.

55:53.896 --> 55:54.897
God help us all.

56:06.658 --> 56:09.453
Anchors aweigh

56:09.536 --> 56:11.955
Oh, goodness, no. No, no, no.

56:12.581 --> 56:16.835
-Anchors aweigh
-No. Ed.

56:16.919 --> 56:20.464
Farewell to college joys

56:20.547 --> 56:25.052
We sail at break of day-ay-ay-ay

56:25.135 --> 56:29.264
Through our last night on shore

56:29.348 --> 56:32.476
Drink to the foam

56:33.143 --> 56:36.605
Until we meet once more

56:36.688 --> 56:40.234
Here's wishing you a happy voyage home

58:10.991 --> 58:12.409
Jesus.
