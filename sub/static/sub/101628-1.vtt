WEBVTT

02:28.278 --> 02:29.410
What are you guys
waiting for? Come on.

02:29.584 --> 02:31.151
Come on!

02:33.588 --> 02:35.851
Oh, come on! It's fine.

02:36.460 --> 02:37.461
I think.

02:38.810 --> 02:40.943
Yeah. It's definitely
up to code.

02:43.554 --> 02:45.426
Oh, God!

02:45.600 --> 02:47.558
Oh, my God.

02:47.732 --> 02:50.474
Okay, okay.

02:50.648 --> 02:52.650
You okay? Yeah?

03:28.469 --> 03:30.384
Looks like a
nor'wester coming in.

03:31.689 --> 03:33.604
Think we should
head down?

03:33.778 --> 03:34.736
Yeah.

03:34.910 --> 03:36.390
I wouldn't wanna
get caught...

03:39.741 --> 03:41.221
Where are you going?

03:42.744 --> 03:44.093
What'd you hear?

03:44.267 --> 03:45.442
I don't know.

03:50.795 --> 03:52.406
There it is again.

04:00.631 --> 04:02.285
I don't hear
anything, man.

04:13.470 --> 04:14.863
What is that?

04:34.622 --> 04:35.492
Paul?

04:35.666 --> 04:36.580
Paul!

04:36.754 --> 04:38.408
Paul! Paul!

04:38.582 --> 04:40.367
Paul! Paul!

04:41.672 --> 04:43.283
You okay
down there, buddy?

04:45.023 --> 04:46.373
Oh, shit.

04:48.766 --> 04:49.767
Okay.

04:50.594 --> 04:52.030
Paul!

04:52.204 --> 04:53.293
Don't worry.
I'm gonna go down there,

04:53.467 --> 04:54.511
and I'm gonna
get him, okay?

04:54.685 --> 04:56.687
Paul!

04:56.861 --> 04:59.429
I'm gonna get him, all right?
He's gonna be okay.

05:00.865 --> 05:01.823
Okay, good!

05:05.087 --> 05:06.741
All right,
be ready to pull him up.

05:58.706 --> 06:00.316
Paul.

06:00.490 --> 06:02.405
What are you doing, man?
Why didn't you answer me?

06:08.455 --> 06:09.412
Paul.

06:25.733 --> 06:27.038
What the fuck is this?

06:27.778 --> 06:28.736
What...

06:31.826 --> 06:33.697
What the fuck are you?

06:59.636 --> 07:00.594
You all right?

07:02.422 --> 07:03.945
Can you stand up?

07:04.119 --> 07:06.861
If you touch me,
you'll die.

07:09.080 --> 07:10.081
What?

07:11.648 --> 07:14.042
If you touch me,
you'll die.

07:19.526 --> 07:20.570
What do you mean,
if I touch you?

07:44.899 --> 07:46.378
Come on.

07:46.553 --> 07:48.772
Come on, man.
Come on.

07:58.565 --> 07:59.653
Paul?

07:59.827 --> 08:00.915
What is it, man?

08:01.089 --> 08:04.005
Stop, stop, stop. Hey.

08:04.179 --> 08:06.616
Hey, come on.

08:06.790 --> 08:08.052
What's going on,
buddy?

08:08.226 --> 08:09.837
Greg?

08:10.011 --> 08:11.926
- What's going on?
- Hold on a minute!

08:14.015 --> 08:15.016
Hey.

08:24.721 --> 08:26.244
Paul, stop fucking around.

08:32.120 --> 08:33.034
Come on, let's go.

08:33.207 --> 08:34.078
Get up. Get up.

08:34.251 --> 08:35.645
Come on. Come on,

08:35.818 --> 08:37.038
I'm gonna get you outta here.
I'm getting you out.

08:38.039 --> 08:39.736
Come on. Stand up.

08:41.042 --> 08:41.999
I got him!

09:04.065 --> 09:05.457
- Just give me a minute.
- Okay.

09:05.632 --> 09:07.111
- Just give me a minute.
- Okay.

09:32.093 --> 09:33.573
There's a house!

09:38.969 --> 09:39.927
Hello!

09:41.102 --> 09:42.059
Hello!

09:42.930 --> 09:44.758
Hello? Hello?

09:45.323 --> 09:46.760
Nobody's here!

09:46.934 --> 09:48.326
Open the door!

10:00.251 --> 10:02.166
Okay, okay.
I got him.

10:02.340 --> 10:03.777
I got him.
I got him.

10:03.951 --> 10:05.387
- Easy.
- I got him.

10:19.357 --> 10:21.011
- Are you in any pain?
- I'm fine. No.

10:24.928 --> 10:26.147
I'll be right back.

10:28.018 --> 10:29.541
Okay.

10:29.716 --> 10:30.847
Let's get his clothes off him

10:31.021 --> 10:32.066
and check him
for insect bites.

10:33.807 --> 10:35.983
Come on, Paul,
can't you say something?

10:36.679 --> 10:37.637
Come on.

11:03.053 --> 11:04.925
What's wrong with him?

11:06.056 --> 11:07.101
I don't know.

11:08.015 --> 11:09.190
There's nothing, um...

11:11.888 --> 11:13.194
I think he's in shock.

11:18.242 --> 11:19.983
Come on, Paul,
give us a sign, huh?

11:21.071 --> 11:22.638
Just make sure
and yelp for me

11:22.812 --> 11:24.858
if I hit any tender
spots, all right? Hmm?

11:44.268 --> 11:45.443
How's he been lately?

11:46.880 --> 11:48.620
Fine. He's been fine!

11:48.795 --> 11:51.493
- Okay, okay. Calm down.
- He's been fine.

12:05.986 --> 12:06.943
Here.

12:10.860 --> 12:12.514
Some kind of
gas pocket, maybe?

12:13.994 --> 12:15.909
I was breathing
the same air he was.

12:17.040 --> 12:18.520
No sign of
a head injury at all?

12:19.477 --> 12:20.522
No.

12:22.829 --> 12:24.526
We need a scan
to be sure but...

12:26.354 --> 12:27.355
What?

12:29.792 --> 12:33.404
If it's not his head,
it's in his head.

12:35.145 --> 12:36.364
We need to get him
to a hospital.

12:36.538 --> 12:37.844
- How?
- I don't know.

12:38.018 --> 12:39.019
There's gotta be somebody.
We can carry him.

12:39.193 --> 12:42.152
We hiked in here,
Ruthie.

12:42.326 --> 12:44.589
Listen to me.
We hiked in here, okay?

12:44.851 --> 12:47.854
We are 5 miles
from the nearest road,

12:48.028 --> 12:49.029
and I can't
carry him anymore.

12:49.203 --> 12:50.508
Not in this weather.

12:57.515 --> 12:58.516
Hey.

13:01.868 --> 13:03.826
He's not physically injured.

13:04.000 --> 13:05.567
Hey, he's not.

13:07.177 --> 13:09.310
Let's keep an eye on him.

13:09.484 --> 13:11.834
And if he doesn't
improve overnight,

13:12.008 --> 13:13.923
then I will hike out

13:14.097 --> 13:16.926
and I will find transport
to Jakar myself, okay?

13:19.320 --> 13:21.191
I'm sure he'll be
fine in the morning.

15:11.214 --> 15:12.824
Ruthie,

15:12.999 --> 15:14.304
you gotta
eat something.

15:28.666 --> 15:29.929
Come on.

15:40.722 --> 15:42.463
We'll be
right back, okay?

16:43.263 --> 16:45.352
Hello, can you help us?

16:50.487 --> 16:52.794
Can you hear me?
We need help!

17:48.850 --> 17:50.678
Go away! Go away!

17:52.158 --> 17:54.203
Ruthie, open up!
It's us!

17:54.377 --> 17:55.378
Greg?

17:57.554 --> 18:00.296
Ruthie,
open the goddamn door!

18:01.819 --> 18:03.473
Ruthie, open!

18:07.825 --> 18:09.175
We can't
get through the pass.

18:09.349 --> 18:10.828
Not in this storm.

18:12.743 --> 18:14.049
Did you see
someone out there?

18:14.223 --> 18:16.138
- No. Just you.
- What?

18:16.312 --> 18:18.053
What were you
doing out there?

18:18.227 --> 18:20.142
There... There...
There was someone out there.

18:20.316 --> 18:21.578
He chased me.

18:21.752 --> 18:23.232
- I wanna get outta here.
- Come on, calm down.

18:23.406 --> 18:25.974
Do not tell me to calm down!
We need to leave!

19:10.453 --> 19:11.411
Paul?

19:16.720 --> 19:17.721
Paul?

19:21.551 --> 19:22.683
Where are you?

19:31.866 --> 19:33.955
Where is he?

19:34.216 --> 19:35.174
He's gotta be
here somewhere.

19:35.348 --> 19:36.305
Hey, Paul.

19:37.872 --> 19:39.787
His jacket's gone.

20:25.485 --> 20:28.314
For fuck's sake, Paul,
what are you doing?

20:28.488 --> 20:29.793
What are you doing?

20:32.796 --> 20:34.145
I am sick

20:34.320 --> 20:36.278
of your "I'm so special"
bullshit, you know that?

20:36.452 --> 20:37.410
That's not helping.

20:38.715 --> 20:40.282
What's going on,
sweetheart?

20:40.456 --> 20:41.805
- You can tell me.
- Oh, don't encourage him!

20:41.979 --> 20:43.764
Just back off, Greg.

20:43.938 --> 20:45.461
- Calm down.
- No, don't tell me to back off!

20:45.635 --> 20:47.681
Do you want him
to get better or not?

20:47.855 --> 20:49.204
No, I don't really give a shit.
This is his fucking fault.

20:49.378 --> 20:50.901
It's not helping, what
you're doing. Just stop it.

20:51.075 --> 20:51.989
I've been dealing
with this selfish bullshit

20:52.251 --> 20:53.991
for 20 years!

20:54.165 --> 20:55.428
He has us lost on a mountain
because he's having a bad day?

20:57.343 --> 20:59.475
Would you fucking
say something?

20:59.649 --> 21:01.521
I told you...

21:04.350 --> 21:05.264
What?

23:13.957 --> 23:15.742
Where were you?

23:18.527 --> 23:20.616
Where were you?

23:29.799 --> 23:30.974
Where were you?

23:40.810 --> 23:41.811
Just this, please.

23:43.073 --> 23:44.640
Yeah, you don't
want that one.

23:44.814 --> 23:45.989
Well, it says
that one has more sprays

23:46.163 --> 23:47.164
than the other ones.

23:47.426 --> 23:48.296
Yes, that's right.

23:48.470 --> 23:49.906
But it uses a formula

23:50.080 --> 23:50.951
where you have to shake it
before you use it.

23:51.125 --> 23:52.866
Oh.

23:53.040 --> 23:54.389
Not something you're gonna
want in an emergency.

23:54.563 --> 23:55.738
I'll show you
what you need.

23:55.912 --> 23:57.479
It's actually cheaper,
anyway.

23:57.653 --> 23:59.002
St. Louis. Todd 3-for-31

23:59.176 --> 24:00.830
to open this year.

24:01.004 --> 24:02.963
He really got into that ball.

24:03.703 --> 24:05.444
It's 2-0.

24:05.618 --> 24:08.011
Former Home Run Derby champ
Todd Frazier

24:08.185 --> 24:09.752
trying to knock another one

24:09.926 --> 24:11.841
outta the park
and up into the stands.

24:12.015 --> 24:14.235
So it's three balls,
no strikes.

24:50.532 --> 24:52.186
Hi. Don't go anywhere.

24:53.970 --> 24:56.016
- This.
- Oh.

24:57.800 --> 24:59.062
You might wanna
check it, see if it's expired.

24:59.236 --> 25:00.281
Oh, of course.

25:00.542 --> 25:02.065
And this is for you.

25:02.239 --> 25:03.589
- I'll be right back.
- Thank you.

25:03.763 --> 25:05.504
Well, I don't need
any change. It's fine.

25:18.168 --> 25:21.955

26:17.924 --> 26:19.142
Hello, Amanda.

26:22.276 --> 26:23.756
Your mom know
you're here?

26:26.672 --> 26:28.499
How's she doing?

26:28.674 --> 26:30.284
I came here to find out
how you're doing.

26:32.373 --> 26:35.202
I mean, it's been
almost a year.

26:37.073 --> 26:38.945
I was concerned
about you.

26:41.251 --> 26:42.775
Thank you.

26:42.949 --> 26:44.777
Maybe you think
that's silly.

26:45.212 --> 26:46.605
No.

26:51.044 --> 26:53.786
Ever since
my father died,

26:53.960 --> 26:58.268
and so soon after
when Allison and Henry...

26:59.748 --> 27:01.794
It's okay.
It's fine.

27:03.012 --> 27:04.013
I mean...

27:05.754 --> 27:07.103
It was more than
any of us could bear.

27:07.277 --> 27:08.409
Yeah.

27:08.583 --> 27:12.631
Any of us.
I myself felt like

27:12.805 --> 27:15.982
I was gonna burst
into a million pieces.

27:17.766 --> 27:19.159
But I...
I came to tell you

27:19.333 --> 27:22.641
that I found something
so wonderful

27:23.250 --> 27:24.773
and so freeing.

27:26.688 --> 27:29.952
And it's helped me to realize
that nothing can hurt you,

27:30.910 --> 27:32.694
because nothing is real.

27:34.348 --> 27:35.654
Amanda,

27:38.004 --> 27:39.309
a lot of things are real.

27:40.049 --> 27:41.094
Are they?

27:41.268 --> 27:42.399
Yeah.

27:42.661 --> 27:44.097
How could you know?

27:45.925 --> 27:48.318
I've learned it
the hard way.

27:50.146 --> 27:52.409
What's real starts here,

27:53.759 --> 27:56.065
and it ends up out here.

27:57.806 --> 28:00.069
What we think
about with focus

28:00.243 --> 28:03.377
and intention and repetition,
we manifest.

28:04.770 --> 28:06.075
It's the power
of positive thinking,

28:06.249 --> 28:07.642
the power of negative
thinking. Right?

28:07.816 --> 28:09.252
Right.

28:09.426 --> 28:12.952
But what if
there's a secret truth?

28:14.910 --> 28:16.172
What if our thoughts

28:16.346 --> 28:18.653
actually begin
somewhere else?

28:18.827 --> 28:21.090
And they travel
through us

28:21.264 --> 28:24.224
like a signal
traveling down a wire.

28:24.398 --> 28:27.488
Thoughts that are old
and hidden and singular.

28:29.751 --> 28:31.579
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

28:34.843 --> 28:37.933
Yes, you do.
Of course you do.

28:50.467 --> 28:51.860
Duty calls.

28:53.296 --> 28:54.428
Okay.

29:08.137 --> 29:10.096
Can I tell her
that I saw you?

29:11.097 --> 29:12.446
Yeah, of course.

29:15.318 --> 29:16.319
Bye.

29:19.148 --> 29:20.759
Thanks for checking on me.

29:39.908 --> 29:41.040
Where were you?

29:47.829 --> 29:48.787
Where were you?

29:50.049 --> 29:51.702
Where were you?

29:51.877 --> 29:52.921
Where were you?

30:11.592 --> 30:12.898
Where were you?

30:37.879 --> 30:39.533
Amanda, want any eggs?

30:41.361 --> 30:43.363
We don't have any eggs.

30:45.234 --> 30:46.366
Amanda?

30:53.242 --> 30:54.896
Mandy, you up?

31:11.913 --> 31:12.914
Amanda.

31:42.291 --> 31:43.466
Hey.

31:47.079 --> 31:48.515
It's okay.
Come on. Come on.

31:59.091 --> 32:00.222
You already
called the police?

32:00.396 --> 32:02.268
Uh-huh.
A few minutes, they said.

32:31.645 --> 32:33.125
I'll be outside.

32:36.041 --> 32:38.173
- Who are you?
- I'm James Lasombra.

32:38.347 --> 32:39.870
Neighbor.
Family friend.

32:40.045 --> 32:42.351
Didn't you used
to be a cop?

32:42.525 --> 32:45.093
- Yes, I did. St. Louis.
- Undercover, right?

32:47.356 --> 32:49.184
Yeah. I remember
hearing about you.

32:50.533 --> 32:52.492
She came to
see you yesterday?

32:53.362 --> 32:54.276
Amanda. Yes.

32:54.450 --> 32:55.669
She say anything

32:55.843 --> 32:56.713
to make you think
she was going somewhere?

32:56.975 --> 32:58.541
No, not at all.

32:58.715 --> 33:00.152
How about her father?
Where's he?

33:00.326 --> 33:02.719
He died two years ago.
Heart attack.

33:05.592 --> 33:06.549
Ma'am.

33:08.638 --> 33:09.683
They were close?

33:11.772 --> 33:14.557
She deal with any
depression after that?

33:14.731 --> 33:16.603
- Any more than the usual?
- Just the usual.

33:16.777 --> 33:18.344
- Nothing too... No.
- No?

33:18.518 --> 33:19.519
How are things for your
daughter at school?

33:19.693 --> 33:20.650
Any trouble?

33:21.260 --> 33:23.131
Not at all.

33:23.305 --> 33:26.134
She had, I mean,
a panic attack the other day,

33:26.308 --> 33:27.570
but it was nothing serious.

33:27.744 --> 33:29.007
She had
a panic attack?

33:29.181 --> 33:30.399
I got a call
from the school.

33:30.573 --> 33:32.097
- She'd been crying in class.
- Crying?

33:32.271 --> 33:33.359
It was...
It was nothing.

33:33.533 --> 33:34.925
She had a bad day,
that's all.

33:35.100 --> 33:36.057
She has a lot of
schoolwork, you know?

33:36.231 --> 33:37.537
Which is a lot of pressure.

33:37.711 --> 33:39.104
Anything like
that happen before?

33:41.628 --> 33:42.716
Um...

33:44.587 --> 33:47.373
Would you say
you two were close?

33:47.547 --> 33:49.288
Yeah, Amanda and I are great.
We're perfect.

33:49.462 --> 33:50.419
Okay.

33:50.593 --> 33:52.160
Listen, Mrs. Quail,

33:52.334 --> 33:54.467
your daughter's
18 years old.

33:54.641 --> 33:56.512
- She's a legal adult.
- She's in high school.

33:56.686 --> 33:59.124
You say her suitcase
is missing,

33:59.298 --> 34:01.430
and she appears to have deliberately
packed. She is free to...

34:01.604 --> 34:02.736
That's not what happened.

34:04.129 --> 34:05.608
I know my daughter.

34:05.782 --> 34:07.610
Christ,
don't you think I'd rather

34:07.784 --> 34:10.831
that was the case
than what I'm afraid of?

34:13.616 --> 34:15.357
I understand
your concern.

34:16.315 --> 34:18.621
We'll see
what we can find.

34:18.795 --> 34:22.321
In the meantime,
if you hear anything, let me know.

34:27.456 --> 34:29.197
Do you have any pets?

34:29.719 --> 34:31.417
No, why?

34:31.591 --> 34:32.983
No reason.

34:33.158 --> 34:35.594
Have a good day, Mrs.
Quail. We'll be in touch.

34:38.250 --> 34:39.599
Talk to you
outside?

35:17.767 --> 35:19.552
Their theory is
Amanda is distressed

35:19.726 --> 35:21.119
and she's acting out
to hurt you.

35:27.429 --> 35:29.605
They're not gonna
do anything, are they?

35:30.345 --> 35:31.825
No. Probably not.

35:55.240 --> 35:56.893
Why did
they ask about pets?

35:58.852 --> 36:00.158
I'm assuming they figure

36:00.332 --> 36:01.333
the blood on the mirror
is not human.

36:02.682 --> 36:05.206
God,
what am I supposed to do?

36:05.380 --> 36:07.904
"He is here, he is there.
He is every-fucking-where."

36:08.166 --> 36:09.210
Who's "he"?

36:09.384 --> 36:11.691
- Probably Peter.
- Yeah?

36:13.519 --> 36:14.824
Yeah, I don't know.

36:20.961 --> 36:22.702
Why don't you make me a list
of Amanda's friends?

36:25.879 --> 36:27.620
Thank you.

36:45.464 --> 36:47.770
Excuse me, Davara.
Davara Walsh?

36:47.944 --> 36:50.120
Hi, I'm James Lasombra.
I'm a friend of Amanda's.

36:50.295 --> 36:52.819
- Yeah. I know who you are.
- You know who I am.

36:52.993 --> 36:55.387
Uh, well, do you know
where Amanda is?

36:55.996 --> 36:57.302
- No.
- No?

36:57.476 --> 36:58.912
You know why
she might run off?

36:59.869 --> 37:01.219
Can I have one?

37:03.612 --> 37:04.961
You know smoking's
bad for you?

37:07.312 --> 37:09.357
All right.
Get in the car.

37:18.366 --> 37:19.324
Okay.

37:26.461 --> 37:27.767
So Amanda's mom told me

37:27.941 --> 37:28.942
she was crying in class
the other day.

37:29.769 --> 37:30.639
She wasn't crying.

37:30.813 --> 37:32.250
She was screaming.

37:42.956 --> 37:44.566
All right, um...

37:47.482 --> 37:49.658
The police, they, um...

37:49.832 --> 37:51.617
They came to gym class today.

37:52.574 --> 37:53.880
They asked us about Amanda.

37:54.881 --> 37:56.752
What'd you tell them?

37:59.015 --> 38:01.496
What didn't
you tell them?

38:02.932 --> 38:04.325
You tell them
about the Empty Man?

38:06.849 --> 38:08.808
That's just some
stupid kid's thing.

38:13.334 --> 38:14.466
What is it?

38:16.337 --> 38:17.338
I don't know.

38:17.512 --> 38:19.862
Some story started
going around

38:20.036 --> 38:22.474
that if you went
to a bridge after dark

38:22.648 --> 38:25.259
and you found
an empty bottle,

38:25.433 --> 38:29.742
and if you blew into it,
and you thought about him,

38:30.917 --> 38:32.745
something would happen.

38:33.876 --> 38:35.530
What happens?

38:39.491 --> 38:40.448
You try it?

38:42.494 --> 38:43.843
When?

38:44.887 --> 38:46.846
Two nights ago,

38:47.020 --> 38:49.892
a few of us were down on
the old Chain of Rocks Bridge.

38:50.066 --> 38:52.155
You know where that is?

38:52.417 --> 38:53.461
Yeah. Yeah, I know.

38:54.941 --> 38:57.726
When I was little,
I had this theory

38:57.900 --> 39:01.121
that I could prevent
anything bad from happening

39:01.382 --> 39:03.471
by thinking
about it beforehand.

39:04.516 --> 39:06.387
What do you mean?

39:06.561 --> 39:08.520
It's like every time
I got into a car,

39:10.783 --> 39:12.262
I'd think about
all the different ways

39:12.437 --> 39:14.395
we could get
into a car accident.

39:14.569 --> 39:16.136
Mm-hmm.

39:16.310 --> 39:18.356
Because what are the odds
of getting hit by a bus

39:18.530 --> 39:20.749
when you just thought about
getting hit by a bus?

39:20.923 --> 39:22.621
Kids are fucking stupid.

39:26.625 --> 39:28.278
Yeah.

39:28.453 --> 39:29.845
He said,
proving his own point.

39:31.107 --> 39:32.935
Dude, what the fuck?

39:35.764 --> 39:37.070
Come on, let's bounce.

39:39.725 --> 39:40.682
You missed some.

39:44.817 --> 39:46.471
Who was there?

39:46.645 --> 39:50.736
Lisa, Duncan,
Meyer, Brandon, and Amanda.

39:52.041 --> 39:53.956
And Julianne was there too.

39:55.436 --> 39:56.481
Bitch.

39:57.656 --> 39:58.831
So,
do you still wanna go?

39:59.571 --> 40:00.876
I don't know.

40:01.747 --> 40:02.922
Not like before,

40:05.185 --> 40:07.230
but sometimes I still feel
like I could just disappear

40:07.492 --> 40:08.928
and no one would
even notice.

40:11.060 --> 40:12.671
I get that.

40:14.977 --> 40:16.805
Have you ever thought
about suicide?

40:16.979 --> 40:18.416
Plenty of times.

40:19.155 --> 40:20.418
I even tried it once.

40:23.769 --> 40:25.205
Psych.

40:25.466 --> 40:26.554
It's where I fell
through some French doors

40:26.728 --> 40:28.164
rollerblading
in my house.

40:28.338 --> 40:30.776
If I ever slit my wrist,
it'll be long and vertical.

40:34.867 --> 40:35.824
Hey, wait.

40:43.179 --> 40:44.659
We gotta try it.

40:44.833 --> 40:46.400
Please don't be dumb.

40:46.574 --> 40:47.706
Try what?

40:48.228 --> 40:49.621
Calling the Empty Man.

40:49.795 --> 40:52.450
Who's the Empty Man?

40:52.624 --> 40:54.060
Well, supposedly

40:54.234 --> 40:55.975
if you're on a bridge
and you find a bottle,

40:57.585 --> 40:58.804
you blow into it

40:58.978 --> 41:01.459
and you think
about the Empty Man.

41:02.895 --> 41:04.723
Then after a little while,

41:04.897 --> 41:07.029
you're supposed to hear him
coming for you.

41:07.203 --> 41:09.075
Tell him the rest.

41:10.990 --> 41:14.559
Well, so on
the first night, you hear him.

41:14.733 --> 41:16.604
Then you can't stop
thinking about him.

41:18.563 --> 41:19.955
And then
on the second night,

41:20.826 --> 41:21.827
you see him.

41:22.567 --> 41:23.959
Following you.

41:24.743 --> 41:26.962
And on the third night?

41:27.136 --> 41:28.877
Well, on the third night,
he finds you.

41:29.051 --> 41:30.488
Oh, come on, Mandy.
How old are you?

41:30.662 --> 41:32.707
Yeah, please, let's go home.
I've got swim at 6:00.

41:32.881 --> 41:34.796
Nah, Amanda,
let's do it.

41:34.970 --> 41:36.450
Brandon wants to
find out what happens.

41:36.624 --> 41:37.582
Don't you, Brandon?

41:39.148 --> 41:40.889
Not particularly. No.

41:56.252 --> 41:57.863
Your turn, scrub.

42:17.926 --> 42:18.971
Nailed it.

42:27.283 --> 42:28.676
This is bullshit.

42:28.850 --> 42:30.852
If it's bullshit,
why won't you do it?

42:31.026 --> 42:33.072
You don't want everyone
thinking you don't blow,

42:33.246 --> 42:34.987
right, Davara?

42:37.685 --> 42:39.208
Fuck all you guys.

43:24.253 --> 43:25.211
The Empty Man.

43:25.385 --> 43:27.039
The Empty Man. The Empty Man.

44:07.688 --> 44:09.168
- What?
- Shh!

44:33.801 --> 44:36.456
Hey, who's out there?

44:49.774 --> 44:51.601
Whoever's out there,
stop fucking around.

44:51.776 --> 44:52.907
Yeah, that's really gonna
handle it. Thanks, Meyer.

44:53.081 --> 44:54.474
Shut up.

44:56.128 --> 44:56.389
It's just an asshole.
Some drunk or a bum or something.

44:58.434 --> 44:59.914
Let's go, please.
Please.

45:25.984 --> 45:26.941
It's probably
just some dorks

45:27.115 --> 45:28.073
messing with us, right?

45:29.857 --> 45:31.337
Was that the last time
you saw Amanda?

45:32.425 --> 45:33.774
I saw her at the mall

45:33.948 --> 45:34.862
the next day
talking to Brandon.

45:40.955 --> 45:43.218
But I didn't talk to her.

45:54.229 --> 45:55.230
You okay?

46:06.502 --> 46:08.287
No, I have to go.

46:09.375 --> 46:10.768
Well, wait a second. Hey.

46:10.942 --> 46:12.204
Could you give me
an address for Brandon?

46:18.253 --> 46:19.951
- Here.
- Thank you.

46:36.358 --> 46:38.099
- Hi.
- Yes?

46:41.059 --> 46:42.190
Does Brandon Maibaum
live here?

46:42.364 --> 46:43.931
Have you seen him?

46:44.540 --> 46:45.541
He's not home?

46:46.542 --> 46:49.284
No. He's not here.

46:49.458 --> 46:51.939
Okay, uh, my name is
James Lasombra.

46:52.113 --> 46:54.159
I'm a friend of
Nora Quail's, who's...

47:03.255 --> 47:05.997
Hello? Lisa?

47:07.215 --> 47:08.303
Mrs. Schwartz?

47:09.957 --> 47:11.132
Anybody home?

47:13.134 --> 47:14.005
Why didn't
you run, you fool?

47:14.179 --> 47:16.007
You were nearly killed.

47:16.181 --> 47:19.271
Quiet.
The god is coming.

47:21.229 --> 47:23.014
What's he talking about?

47:23.188 --> 47:24.406
He said the god is coming.

47:25.407 --> 47:26.278
Hello?

47:26.452 --> 47:27.540
Which god?

47:28.541 --> 47:31.892
His god. Aten.

47:32.066 --> 47:34.329
- Aten?
- Look!

47:34.503 --> 47:35.374
Lisa?

48:44.312 --> 48:45.270
Hello?

48:45.444 --> 48:47.098
Hey, Nora, it's me.

48:47.272 --> 48:49.361
Listen, how well do you know
Amanda's friends?

48:49.535 --> 48:51.363
Do any of them
seem kinda off to you?

48:51.537 --> 48:52.668
Off how?

48:52.930 --> 48:54.496
Into weird stuff.

48:54.670 --> 48:55.976
What kind of weird stuff?

48:56.150 --> 48:58.761
I don't know.
I'm just grasping, Nora.

48:59.023 --> 49:01.068
I mean,
I don't wanna worry you,

49:01.242 --> 49:03.027
but I tried to find, uh,

49:03.201 --> 49:04.767
all of Amanda's friends
who were last seen with her,

49:05.029 --> 49:06.944
and I just can't
seem to locate them.

49:07.118 --> 49:08.423
None of them?

49:08.597 --> 49:10.121
Aside from
Davara Walsh, no.

49:12.166 --> 49:14.516
You ever heard
of the Pontifex Institute?

49:14.690 --> 49:16.779
She ever mention that before?

49:17.041 --> 49:19.391
- No. No. What is that?
- I don't know.

49:19.565 --> 49:21.175
It might not have anything
to do with anything.

49:22.568 --> 49:24.352
Listen, I got
a few more stops to make.

49:24.526 --> 49:26.615
So, why don't we
talk about this later tonight?

49:28.182 --> 49:30.097
Everything's gonna
be fine, Nora.

49:30.271 --> 49:31.664
All right, bye.

55:46.734 --> 55:48.040
Leave me alone!

56:31.649 --> 56:32.824
What is your problem?

56:32.998 --> 56:35.000
Why would she do that?

56:35.174 --> 56:36.654
She knew Amanda Quail.

56:36.828 --> 56:38.438
Is that why
you were talking to her?

56:38.612 --> 56:41.572
Yeah, that's right.
They're friends.

56:41.746 --> 56:43.617
I was hoping
maybe she'd seen her.

56:43.791 --> 56:44.966
And had she?

56:45.140 --> 56:47.665
Not since yesterday
at school. No.

56:47.839 --> 56:50.842
How well did you know
the Walsh girl?

56:51.016 --> 56:52.409
Hardly at all.

56:54.411 --> 56:55.542
What do you mean "did"?

56:56.891 --> 56:58.719
Davara Walsh
died tonight.

56:58.893 --> 57:02.984
Her body was found in a
spa earlier this evening.

57:03.158 --> 57:06.553
Stabbed multiple times.
We don't know how many. A lot.

57:06.727 --> 57:08.468
Oh, crap.

57:08.642 --> 57:10.078
She was stabbed
in the face.

57:15.214 --> 57:17.259
You have a suspect?

57:17.521 --> 57:20.001
By all appearances,
it was a suicide.

57:21.699 --> 57:22.961
People don't...

57:27.182 --> 57:29.010
People just don't do that
to themselves.

57:31.056 --> 57:32.971
My point exactly.

57:37.628 --> 57:41.675
You know this town.
One, two murders a year.

57:41.849 --> 57:44.896
Three if we're frisky.
Now this?

57:46.071 --> 57:48.508
It poisons the atmosphere.

57:48.682 --> 57:51.816
Sure as sewage
would the water supply.

57:54.645 --> 57:55.602
It's communicable.

57:58.692 --> 57:59.650
It changes people.

58:01.739 --> 58:05.656
Three weeks ago,
in a house in Maryville,

58:05.830 --> 58:07.919
a mother fed
her newborn infant

58:08.093 --> 58:10.748
to a pack
of stray dogs.

58:10.922 --> 58:14.491
She said the baby
had been whispering to her.

58:16.101 --> 58:17.755
In the kitchen,

58:17.929 --> 58:21.889
she wrote "The Empty Man"
on the linoleum floor.

58:23.238 --> 58:25.763
We found
the same thing tonight

58:25.937 --> 58:27.504
near the body
of the Walsh girl.

58:28.809 --> 58:30.463
I've come
to the conclusion

58:30.637 --> 58:33.553
that there is no solving
crimes like these.

58:34.902 --> 58:36.904
Sure, we can put
that mother in prison.

58:37.078 --> 58:39.733
We can even put her
in the gas chamber.

58:40.734 --> 58:43.041
But that's not solving it.

58:44.608 --> 58:46.305
It's inexplicable.

58:48.960 --> 58:50.918
It's too big. It's...

58:54.705 --> 58:56.924
We can't indict the cosmos.

59:14.507 --> 59:15.987
You tell
them about the Empty Man?

59:16.161 --> 59:18.424
That's just
some stupid kid's thing.

59:18.598 --> 59:20.208
What is it?

59:20.382 --> 59:22.471
It started
a while ago. I don't know.

59:22.646 --> 59:26.388
Some story started
going around

59:26.650 --> 59:28.913
that if you went to a bridge
after dark

59:29.087 --> 59:31.698
and you found
an empty bottle,

59:31.872 --> 59:35.136
and if you blew into it,
and you thought about him,

59:36.007 --> 59:37.965
something would happen.

59:38.139 --> 59:39.663
What happens?

59:39.837 --> 59:42.404
On the first night,
you'd hear him.

59:42.666 --> 59:44.842
And then the second night,
you'd see him.

59:45.016 --> 59:46.626
On the third night...

59:48.149 --> 59:49.847
you'd feel him.

01:01:16.411 --> 01:01:17.891
- Hello.
- Are you all right?

01:01:18.065 --> 01:01:19.676
Yeah, fine.

01:01:20.415 --> 01:01:21.895
You don't sound fine.

01:01:22.069 --> 01:01:23.897
It's just a bloody nose.

01:01:24.071 --> 01:01:25.333
Oh, okay.

01:01:26.247 --> 01:01:28.685
Um... I'm outside.

01:01:33.864 --> 01:01:34.821
Hi.

01:01:35.822 --> 01:01:37.258
I'm guessing
you forgot to eat.

01:01:37.432 --> 01:01:40.697
No, I didn't forget.
It just never occurred to me.

01:01:42.133 --> 01:01:43.221
Come inside.

01:01:49.444 --> 01:01:51.882
- Plates?
- Next one on your right.

01:01:55.102 --> 01:01:57.148
I just got you some, um,

01:01:57.322 --> 01:01:59.933
egg rolls
and Szechuan beef,

01:02:00.107 --> 01:02:02.066
a little egg drop soup.

01:02:04.155 --> 01:02:05.809
There's a big vigil
in Slattery Park.

01:02:05.983 --> 01:02:07.462
You know,
everyone's there.

01:02:07.724 --> 01:02:09.290
I made some flyers,

01:02:09.464 --> 01:02:11.379
I was gonna
put up around town...

01:02:17.908 --> 01:02:18.865
Hey.

01:02:20.171 --> 01:02:21.563
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

01:02:21.825 --> 01:02:23.391
- I'm sorry.
- No, no, no.

01:02:23.565 --> 01:02:24.741
- None of this is your problem.
- Don't be sorry.

01:02:25.002 --> 01:02:26.133
Don't be sorry.
You have nothing...

01:02:26.307 --> 01:02:27.439
You have nothing
to apologize for. Okay?

01:02:30.790 --> 01:02:31.791
All right?

01:02:31.965 --> 01:02:33.227
Yes. Yes, I do.

01:02:36.753 --> 01:02:37.536
I'm sorry.

01:02:39.799 --> 01:02:41.279
I'm sorry
it's been so long.

01:02:41.453 --> 01:02:44.456
And I'm sorry about why.

01:02:51.376 --> 01:02:52.899
Do you think she's okay?

01:02:54.771 --> 01:02:55.554
Come here.

01:03:00.037 --> 01:03:00.994
It's okay.

01:03:05.129 --> 01:03:06.957
It's okay.
Everything's okay.

01:03:14.181 --> 01:03:15.400
May I stay?

01:03:24.409 --> 01:03:25.410
God.

01:03:32.112 --> 01:03:33.374
Boundaries.

01:03:35.812 --> 01:03:37.074
You want a drink?

01:03:37.248 --> 01:03:38.292
Mm-hmm.

01:04:33.130 --> 01:04:35.001
Where were you?

01:04:38.309 --> 01:04:40.311
Where were you?

01:04:43.662 --> 01:04:45.664
On the first night,

01:04:47.927 --> 01:04:50.321
you hear him.

01:04:52.062 --> 01:04:53.672
Hey, sleepyhead.

01:05:36.193 --> 01:05:37.281
Hello?

01:08:14.351 --> 01:08:15.613
...self-inflicted.

01:08:15.787 --> 01:08:17.658
Any reason
the group of friends

01:08:17.832 --> 01:08:19.006
might have committed suicide
remain unclear at this hour.

01:08:19.182 --> 01:08:20.487
Another member of the group,

01:08:20.661 --> 01:08:21.401
Amanda Quail,
is still missing.

01:09:03.356 --> 01:09:04.836
Welcome.

01:09:05.010 --> 01:09:06.359
Go ahead and have a seat.
You're just in time.

01:09:08.535 --> 01:09:09.667
Well, that's good news.

01:09:10.667 --> 01:09:12.278
Can I ask you
a question?

01:09:12.452 --> 01:09:14.585
How long you guys been
in business here?

01:09:14.759 --> 01:09:17.544
We were established
in 2013.

01:09:17.718 --> 01:09:20.546
But what we can offer you
is as old as time.

01:09:21.809 --> 01:09:22.810
Okay.

01:09:53.406 --> 01:09:54.364
Hi.

01:09:55.278 --> 01:09:56.627
What is this?

01:09:56.801 --> 01:09:58.455
That is your first step
on a journey

01:09:58.629 --> 01:09:59.760
to discovering
your deepest self.

01:09:59.934 --> 01:10:01.109
Oh, yeah.
No, I get all that.

01:10:01.284 --> 01:10:02.720
I grew up
in San Francisco.

01:10:03.590 --> 01:10:05.201
What is this?

01:10:05.375 --> 01:10:07.464
Welcome, everyone.

01:10:07.638 --> 01:10:09.553
Please just have a seat.
I'll be with you in a moment.

01:10:13.992 --> 01:10:16.777
Hey. Hey.
So I'm looking for someone.

01:10:16.951 --> 01:10:18.475
Just make
yourself comfortable.

01:10:18.649 --> 01:10:20.738
I'm sure you'll find the
answers you're looking for.

01:10:28.572 --> 01:10:29.529
Follow me.

01:10:38.277 --> 01:10:39.931
Sound check. One, two, three.

01:10:41.454 --> 01:10:43.891
Check. One, two, three.

01:10:48.418 --> 01:10:51.247
Each one of you
here today

01:10:51.421 --> 01:10:53.249
is looking for something.

01:10:54.293 --> 01:10:55.816
Why else would you be here?

01:10:57.296 --> 01:11:00.647
We go looking for things
we have lost.

01:11:01.692 --> 01:11:03.650
Yes? Well, I'm here
to tell you,

01:11:03.824 --> 01:11:07.524
there is nothing
you have lost.

01:11:07.698 --> 01:11:11.615
More than that, there is
no such thing as loss.

01:11:13.007 --> 01:11:15.227
From our earliest days,

01:11:15.401 --> 01:11:17.447
meeting in garages,

01:11:17.621 --> 01:11:19.884
living rooms,
church basements,

01:11:20.058 --> 01:11:22.365
to this very moment,

01:11:22.539 --> 01:11:24.889
our message
has always remained

01:11:25.063 --> 01:11:28.980
"you are complete
in yourself."

01:11:29.937 --> 01:11:31.461
There is no struggle.

01:11:32.940 --> 01:11:34.638
Struggling has failed.

01:11:34.812 --> 01:11:36.683
Struggling is what
wakes you up every day,

01:11:36.857 --> 01:11:39.338
wondering how much more
you can acquire,

01:11:39.512 --> 01:11:41.253
how much more you can use,

01:11:41.427 --> 01:11:45.388
how much more space
can you take up in the world.

01:11:45.562 --> 01:11:47.738
When the question we really
need to ask ourselves is,

01:11:47.912 --> 01:11:50.697
how much less can you use?

01:11:50.871 --> 01:11:55.049
How much less space
can you occupy?

01:11:57.443 --> 01:11:58.662
There is no struggle

01:11:58.836 --> 01:12:02.056
because there are
no distinctions.

01:12:02.318 --> 01:12:04.624
To say that you are wrong,

01:12:04.798 --> 01:12:07.627
or I am right,
is to divide us.

01:12:07.801 --> 01:12:09.716
Therefore we deny
there is such a thing

01:12:09.890 --> 01:12:11.892
as right or wrong.

01:12:12.066 --> 01:12:14.460
These are
exclusionary constructs

01:12:14.634 --> 01:12:18.290
designed to foster
the illusion of separateness.

01:12:18.464 --> 01:12:23.556
There is no such thing
as disunity.

01:12:23.730 --> 01:12:28.387
There is only
the great, binding

01:12:28.561 --> 01:12:31.608
nothingness of things.

01:12:32.652 --> 01:12:34.959
At one time we were one.

01:12:36.395 --> 01:12:38.049
We will all be one again.

01:12:40.443 --> 01:12:43.402
This message comes to you
directly from

01:12:43.576 --> 01:12:45.578
the Empty Man.

01:12:45.752 --> 01:12:47.493
He beckons you

01:12:47.667 --> 01:12:51.410
to discover the true face
of the world.

01:13:08.775 --> 01:13:10.473
Can I ask you
to sign these?

01:13:12.388 --> 01:13:13.563
Thank you.

01:13:15.434 --> 01:13:16.696
Thank you for coming.

01:13:16.870 --> 01:13:18.306
For a second there,

01:13:18.481 --> 01:13:20.004
I thought you were
about to say "namaste."

01:13:20.178 --> 01:13:21.440
I can if you like.

01:13:21.614 --> 01:13:22.833
No, no, no.
Please, please, please.

01:13:23.007 --> 01:13:24.225
- I grew up in San Francisco.
- Ah.

01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:25.966
But towards the end
you did say...

01:13:26.140 --> 01:13:27.141
"The Empty Man."

01:13:27.403 --> 01:13:28.447
That's right.

01:13:28.621 --> 01:13:29.840
That's an interesting phrase.

01:13:31.058 --> 01:13:32.886
You could say
he called out to you.

01:13:33.060 --> 01:13:34.801
- Or not.
- Hmm.

01:13:35.541 --> 01:13:36.716
What does it mean?

01:13:37.108 --> 01:13:39.763
The Empty Man is

01:13:39.937 --> 01:13:41.808
a meditation.

01:13:41.982 --> 01:13:44.376
A focal point for
the targeted manifestation

01:13:44.550 --> 01:13:46.030
of hidden energies.

01:13:46.204 --> 01:13:47.727
Right. And already
you're starting to lose me.

01:13:48.772 --> 01:13:51.383
Just as man feeds
and is fed

01:13:51.557 --> 01:13:54.604
by the biosphere
and the atmosphere,

01:13:54.778 --> 01:14:00.218
so it is our thoughts feed
and are fed by the noosphere.

01:14:00.479 --> 01:14:01.567
The noosphere?

01:14:01.741 --> 01:14:05.005
The sum
of all conscious thought,

01:14:05.179 --> 01:14:07.530
transmission from which
can be stimulated

01:14:07.704 --> 01:14:10.446
through the application
of certain vectors,

01:14:10.620 --> 01:14:12.491
very much like a virus.

01:14:14.667 --> 01:14:16.539
You can't see it.

01:14:17.017 --> 01:14:19.106
Well, what is it?

01:14:20.891 --> 01:14:24.242
The veil between
form and flesh,

01:14:24.503 --> 01:14:25.852
and the means by which
it can be pierced

01:14:26.026 --> 01:14:28.899
and the two allowed
to commingle.

01:14:32.685 --> 01:14:34.774
We're each of us blind
in our way.

01:14:38.038 --> 01:14:39.910
Distractions
rob us of focus.

01:14:41.041 --> 01:14:43.827
Technology robs us
of memory.

01:14:45.132 --> 01:14:48.527
Repetition robs us
of comprehension.

01:14:49.615 --> 01:14:51.661
You know
the child's game,

01:14:51.835 --> 01:14:53.576
if you say your name
enough times,

01:14:53.750 --> 01:14:55.491
it becomes gibberish?

01:14:57.101 --> 01:14:59.886
That holds true
for whole concepts,

01:15:00.060 --> 01:15:03.411
even entire bodies
of thought.

01:15:03.586 --> 01:15:06.937
For example,
take Nietzsche's old line,

01:15:07.111 --> 01:15:11.071
"If you stare into an abyss,
it also stares into you."

01:15:11.245 --> 01:15:13.334
Right? Well...

01:15:13.596 --> 01:15:15.772
That has been
rendered meaningless

01:15:15.946 --> 01:15:17.251
through repetition.

01:15:18.775 --> 01:15:21.952
It's a refrigerator magnet.

01:15:22.126 --> 01:15:24.868
It's cliche.
It's harmless.

01:15:25.042 --> 01:15:29.002
But when was the last time
you really thought about that?

01:15:29.176 --> 01:15:31.439
What is an abyss?

01:15:31.614 --> 01:15:33.267
And if you
stare into it, why?

01:15:34.225 --> 01:15:36.009
What about it calls to you?

01:15:36.183 --> 01:15:38.142
And if it stares into you,

01:15:38.316 --> 01:15:40.753
it stands to reason
something in you

01:15:40.927 --> 01:15:43.887
must also be
calling to it.

01:15:44.061 --> 01:15:48.456
And that, my friend,
is anything but harmless,

01:15:48.631 --> 01:15:49.806
if you really
reflect on it.

01:15:49.980 --> 01:15:51.808
So the question becomes,

01:15:51.982 --> 01:15:54.767
if profound meaning
can be robbed of something

01:15:54.941 --> 01:15:59.467
by so simple a task
as repetition,

01:15:59.642 --> 01:16:02.732
which is more fundamental?
Which is more true?

01:16:03.776 --> 01:16:04.908
Your name

01:16:06.083 --> 01:16:07.780
or the gibberish?

01:16:08.302 --> 01:16:10.087
That is the Empty Man.

01:16:13.786 --> 01:16:15.483
I'm so glad
you came back.

01:16:15.658 --> 01:16:17.268
Hope you stay longer
this time.

01:16:19.139 --> 01:16:20.924
I've never been here before.

01:16:21.881 --> 01:16:22.969
- And here.
- Hmm.

01:16:23.143 --> 01:16:25.276
There must be
something about you.

01:16:26.320 --> 01:16:28.105
Sir,
just one more signature.

01:16:40.334 --> 01:16:41.901
Hey, man.

01:16:42.075 --> 01:16:43.860
You, uh...

01:16:44.034 --> 01:16:46.776
You seen this girl here?
She hang out here?

01:16:47.907 --> 01:16:48.865
No?

01:16:50.301 --> 01:16:51.389
Liar.

01:16:53.739 --> 01:16:55.611
- Thank you so much.
- Give us a minute.

01:16:59.136 --> 01:17:02.052
Hmm. Thank you for coming.
Thank you.

01:17:03.793 --> 01:17:04.750
Here.

01:17:47.053 --> 01:17:49.839
Nothing exists.

01:17:50.013 --> 01:17:54.191
Even if something exists,
nothing can be known about it.

01:17:56.062 --> 01:17:58.586
Even if something
can be known about it,

01:17:58.761 --> 01:18:01.024
knowledge about it can't be
communicated to others.

01:18:04.027 --> 01:18:06.246
Even if it can
be communicated,

01:18:06.420 --> 01:18:07.813
it cannot be understood.

01:18:09.728 --> 01:18:10.729
Nothing exists.

01:18:12.383 --> 01:18:16.561
Even if something exists,
nothing can be known about it.

01:18:18.258 --> 01:18:20.826
Even if something
can be known about it,

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:24.047
knowledge about it can't be
communicated to others.

01:18:25.744 --> 01:18:27.833
Even if it
can be communicated,

01:18:28.007 --> 01:18:29.139
it cannot be understood.

01:19:33.290 --> 01:19:34.552
...from his thoughts.

01:19:34.813 --> 01:19:36.772
From his thoughts
come the dreams.

01:19:36.946 --> 01:19:38.948
From the dreams
comes the power.

01:19:39.122 --> 01:19:41.124
From the power
comes the bridge.

01:19:41.298 --> 01:19:43.561
From the bridge comes the man.

01:19:43.822 --> 01:19:45.955
From the man
comes his thoughts.

01:19:46.129 --> 01:19:48.174
From his thoughts
come the dreams.

01:19:48.348 --> 01:19:50.394
From the dreams
comes the power.

01:19:50.568 --> 01:19:53.223
From the power
comes the bridge.

01:19:53.397 --> 01:19:54.746
From the bridge comes the...

01:19:58.271 --> 01:20:00.360
Shit. Shit. Shit.

01:20:02.406 --> 01:20:04.800
Is there someone here now?

01:20:06.236 --> 01:20:09.805
If you're here now,
show yourself.

01:20:10.893 --> 01:20:12.329
Make yourself
known to us.

01:20:19.205 --> 01:20:20.728
We hear you.

01:20:20.903 --> 01:20:23.731
We're listening.

01:20:23.906 --> 01:20:24.994
Welcome.

01:20:25.559 --> 01:20:26.517
Show yourself.

01:20:28.345 --> 01:20:29.563
Show yourself.

01:20:58.157 --> 01:20:59.115
Would you
come with us, sir?

01:21:05.034 --> 01:21:06.078
Huh.

01:21:07.166 --> 01:21:08.515
How you doing?

01:21:10.517 --> 01:21:12.041
Exit's that way.

01:21:27.099 --> 01:21:28.535
You'll never get
anywhere like that, man.

01:21:29.449 --> 01:21:30.929
Not with these cats.

01:21:32.017 --> 01:21:32.931
Cats?

01:21:33.105 --> 01:21:34.890
Man, these cats,

01:21:35.064 --> 01:21:36.848
they're on another plane,
man. You know?

01:21:37.022 --> 01:21:39.938
Like, far out
on the outer rim.

01:21:41.984 --> 01:21:44.334
Aren't you a little young
for the Neal Cassady routine?

01:21:45.291 --> 01:21:46.989
Who's that, man?

01:21:54.083 --> 01:21:55.388
You got a smoke?

01:22:06.486 --> 01:22:07.923
She's been here.

01:22:08.967 --> 01:22:11.317
But she's not here now.

01:22:11.491 --> 01:22:13.276
Got big plans for her.
They're moving her up.

01:22:14.103 --> 01:22:15.104
Where is she?

01:22:15.669 --> 01:22:16.714
Elsewhere.

01:22:18.324 --> 01:22:19.847
Downstate.

01:22:20.022 --> 01:22:22.459
Pontifex camp,
where they go to get PR'd.

01:22:23.112 --> 01:22:24.026
What is that?

01:22:24.504 --> 01:22:26.071
Pre-Released.

01:22:26.245 --> 01:22:28.030
It's the First Threshold
to achieving Singularity.

01:22:28.204 --> 01:22:30.293
Christ, this jargon.

01:22:30.467 --> 01:22:33.078
They have bullshit names
for everything, man.

01:22:34.166 --> 01:22:36.168
Comes to them in dreams,
they say.

01:22:37.039 --> 01:22:38.475
His whispers.

01:22:39.519 --> 01:22:40.956
Whose whispers?

01:22:42.522 --> 01:22:43.959
I don't know.

01:22:45.221 --> 01:22:46.178
But they do.

01:22:50.313 --> 01:22:52.402
These aren't just flakes
and outcasts.

01:22:52.576 --> 01:22:55.535
They don't have 5-year plans,
they have 500-year plans.

01:22:55.709 --> 01:22:58.321
You have no idea how dangerous
these people are, man.

01:22:58.495 --> 01:23:00.105
Where's the camp?

01:23:00.279 --> 01:23:02.978
In the forest.
Off Route 32.

01:23:03.152 --> 01:23:04.588
Near the Meramec River Bridge.

01:26:27.312 --> 01:26:28.357
Yeah, okay.

01:26:29.880 --> 01:26:31.751
That's funny.

01:26:33.753 --> 01:26:35.625
You guys are funny.

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:48.872
The Pontifex Society.

01:27:49.046 --> 01:27:51.396
We transmit. You receive.

01:27:53.833 --> 01:27:55.008
Testing.

01:27:57.402 --> 01:27:59.230
From his
thoughts comes the dream.

01:27:59.404 --> 01:28:02.277
From the dream
comes the power.

01:28:02.451 --> 01:28:04.844
From the power
comes the bridge.

01:28:05.018 --> 01:28:07.325
From the bridge
comes the man.

01:28:26.736 --> 01:28:27.693
We should turn it off.

01:28:35.832 --> 01:28:36.789
Did you see that?

01:28:38.051 --> 01:28:39.401
What?

01:28:40.880 --> 01:28:42.578
Come give me
a hand with this.

01:28:55.025 --> 01:28:56.983
What the hell is he doing?

01:28:59.421 --> 01:29:00.378
Fuck.

01:29:02.728 --> 01:29:03.729
Nasty.

01:29:05.949 --> 01:29:07.907
This is only getting worse.

01:33:30.169 --> 01:33:31.606
Yeah, no.

01:34:07.685 --> 01:34:08.686
Come on.

01:34:11.036 --> 01:34:12.168
Come on!

01:34:33.885 --> 01:34:36.235
What the fuck was that?

01:34:37.846 --> 01:34:39.543
What the fuck was that?

01:34:50.423 --> 01:34:51.947
Will you be able to
identify any of them?

01:34:52.121 --> 01:34:54.253
No. Way too dark, man.

01:34:54.427 --> 01:34:55.994
Uh-huh.

01:34:56.168 --> 01:34:59.737
And they attacked you
after you took these files?

01:34:59.911 --> 01:35:01.478
Yeah, but that had...

01:35:03.001 --> 01:35:04.133
There was two cabins.

01:35:04.307 --> 01:35:05.830
I took the files
from the first cabin.

01:35:06.004 --> 01:35:07.919
But they wouldn't know that.
They couldn't see it.

01:35:08.093 --> 01:35:09.399
Were these
cabins locked?

01:35:10.443 --> 01:35:12.881
No, they were not locked.

01:35:13.055 --> 01:35:15.100
Was the road
into the camp blocked?

01:35:15.274 --> 01:35:16.580
What are you trying to say?

01:35:16.754 --> 01:35:17.799
You're saying
that I was trespassing?

01:35:17.973 --> 01:35:20.062
I am trying to determine

01:35:20.236 --> 01:35:22.194
if you have irretrievably
fucked this investigation.

01:35:22.368 --> 01:35:23.718
You can check out
the Pontifex Institute.

01:35:23.892 --> 01:35:25.241
Major Cases
is already on it.

01:35:25.415 --> 01:35:26.764
This is bad news.
This is weird occult shit.

01:35:26.938 --> 01:35:27.722
And you are
not a cop anymore.

01:35:32.465 --> 01:35:33.902
Come on, Lasombra.

01:35:37.470 --> 01:35:39.777
Just write a statement.

01:35:39.951 --> 01:35:41.736
Everything that happened.

01:35:42.780 --> 01:35:44.390
I'll be right back.

01:36:22.777 --> 01:36:23.560
Nora!

01:36:27.346 --> 01:36:28.304
Hi.

01:36:29.522 --> 01:36:31.176
- Are you alone?
- Yes.

01:36:32.221 --> 01:36:34.005
- Has anyone come by?
- No.

01:36:34.179 --> 01:36:35.572
- Contacted by anybody?
- Like who?

01:36:35.833 --> 01:36:37.313
What are you doing?
James?

01:36:37.487 --> 01:36:39.097
Do you have a place
you can go for a few days?

01:36:39.271 --> 01:36:40.359
What?

01:36:41.491 --> 01:36:42.709
I don't want
to scare you...

01:36:42.884 --> 01:36:45.451
Well, you are.
You are scaring me.

01:36:49.368 --> 01:36:51.153
James.

01:36:51.327 --> 01:36:53.155
Maybe I want to scare
you a little bit.

01:36:53.329 --> 01:36:54.373
Do you remember
the Pontifex Institute?

01:36:54.547 --> 01:36:55.679
I told you about them.

01:36:55.853 --> 01:36:57.376
- Yes.
- I checked them out.

01:36:57.550 --> 01:36:59.204
On the surface,
it looks like some sort of

01:36:59.378 --> 01:37:01.903
self-empowerment "oneness"
hippy bullshit.

01:37:03.339 --> 01:37:04.819
But they're dangerous.

01:37:06.255 --> 01:37:09.954
Are you saying that
Amanda has joined a...

01:37:10.128 --> 01:37:11.869
- A cult?
- Maybe.

01:37:12.043 --> 01:37:13.088
They're not connected
to any sort of

01:37:13.262 --> 01:37:14.045
fucking church
I've ever heard of.

01:37:14.219 --> 01:37:15.786
Oh, my God.

01:37:15.960 --> 01:37:17.179
And whoever they are,
they seem to believe

01:37:17.353 --> 01:37:19.050
that they can channel
some sort of entity.

01:37:20.530 --> 01:37:22.793
The Empty Man.Yeah.

01:37:22.967 --> 01:37:23.925
Do you have place you can go?

01:37:25.230 --> 01:37:27.189
I... I have to work.
I mean, what am I...

01:37:27.363 --> 01:37:28.625
Hey, hey, hey.

01:37:30.932 --> 01:37:32.237
I think they killed
those kids, Nora.

01:37:33.325 --> 01:37:34.413
And they know
where you live.

01:37:38.548 --> 01:37:39.854
Get it.

01:37:42.378 --> 01:37:43.379
Hello?

01:37:47.905 --> 01:37:49.037
Give it to me.

01:37:59.090 --> 01:38:00.439
We need to go right now.

01:38:07.316 --> 01:38:10.058
Get in your car,
follow me.Okay.

01:38:26.596 --> 01:38:28.206
I don't think
we've been followed.

01:38:29.120 --> 01:38:31.470
If you see
anything suspicious,

01:38:31.644 --> 01:38:33.081
you'll let me know?

01:38:33.255 --> 01:38:34.125
Anything at all?

01:38:34.604 --> 01:38:35.692
Okay.

01:38:39.304 --> 01:38:41.002
She's dead, isn't she?

01:38:41.350 --> 01:38:42.829
No, no.

01:38:43.004 --> 01:38:45.180
No, she's not dead.

01:38:45.354 --> 01:38:48.009
I think the fact that she
wasn't under that bridge

01:38:48.183 --> 01:38:50.272
means she's not.
Okay?

01:38:53.405 --> 01:38:54.363
Hey.

01:38:56.974 --> 01:38:58.280
Does she know?

01:38:58.454 --> 01:38:59.629
About what?

01:39:02.414 --> 01:39:04.199
About us?

01:39:04.373 --> 01:39:06.288
You mean the thing
we never talk about?

01:39:08.377 --> 01:39:10.596
No, no, I don't think so.

01:39:11.641 --> 01:39:12.990
Why?

01:39:13.164 --> 01:39:14.252
You never told her?

01:39:15.297 --> 01:39:16.602
Why would I?

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:24.088
Do you think maybe

01:39:24.262 --> 01:39:26.177
we've punished ourselves
long enough?

01:39:54.510 --> 01:39:56.294
Where were you?

01:40:09.090 --> 01:40:10.439
Where were you?

01:40:10.613 --> 01:40:11.614
On the second night...

01:40:11.788 --> 01:40:12.745
On the second night,

01:40:14.008 --> 01:40:16.445
you see him.

01:40:20.449 --> 01:40:21.537
Where were you?

01:45:01.599 --> 01:45:02.600
All available doctors

01:45:02.774 --> 01:45:04.385
to Med Wing 3.

01:45:04.559 --> 01:45:06.822
All available doctors
to Med Wing 3.

01:45:21.967 --> 01:45:26.407
EKG stat to ER.
EKG stat to ER.

01:46:36.781 --> 01:46:38.130
All right,
I'll see you next week.

01:46:38.392 --> 01:46:39.567
You got it.

01:46:48.924 --> 01:46:50.012
How you doing,
Neal Cassady?

01:46:53.450 --> 01:46:54.799
Come here.

01:46:54.973 --> 01:46:56.018
Get in the car.
Get in the fucking car!

01:46:57.454 --> 01:46:58.716
Give me your hands.

01:47:15.167 --> 01:47:17.256
I didn't know what
they were gonna do, man.

01:47:17.431 --> 01:47:18.519
- They just told me to tell you about it. That's all.
- That's bullshit!

01:47:18.693 --> 01:47:19.911
Who's that guy
in the hospital?

01:47:20.085 --> 01:47:21.652
I saw you, freak show.
You and your buddies.

01:47:21.826 --> 01:47:23.393
Jesus, this shit
really stings, man.

01:47:23.567 --> 01:47:24.655
I don't give a shit.
Who was he?

01:47:24.829 --> 01:47:26.135
It's hard to explain.

01:47:26.309 --> 01:47:27.441
Why don't you
give it a go, man?

01:47:27.615 --> 01:47:28.442
I'm your only friend
right now.

01:47:28.616 --> 01:47:30.661
He's like an antenna.

01:47:30.835 --> 01:47:32.533
Tuned to frequencies
we only get through him.

01:47:32.707 --> 01:47:34.143
He transmits, we receive.

01:47:35.144 --> 01:47:36.145
Fuck.

01:47:42.760 --> 01:47:44.022
Get the fuck
out of the car.

01:47:48.070 --> 01:47:49.332
Get on your knees.
On your knees!

01:47:49.506 --> 01:47:50.507
All right. Fuck.

01:47:51.682 --> 01:47:52.727
You say something
that makes sense,

01:47:52.901 --> 01:47:53.902
or I swear
to fucking God...

01:47:54.076 --> 01:47:55.469
Thought is communicable.

01:47:55.643 --> 01:47:56.774
That is what
they say, okay?

01:47:56.948 --> 01:47:58.776
- What?
- Transmittable.

01:47:58.950 --> 01:48:01.736
The noosphere is the sum
of all consciousness.

01:48:01.910 --> 01:48:04.303
Not just human.
Other minds are there, too.

01:48:04.565 --> 01:48:05.870
- Ancient, and angry.
- You guys are all

01:48:06.044 --> 01:48:07.437
- fucking morons!
- You get glimpses

01:48:07.611 --> 01:48:08.917
in dreams and fevers,
right?

01:48:10.048 --> 01:48:11.702
Deja vu?

01:48:11.876 --> 01:48:13.008
Every nightmare
you've ever had

01:48:13.182 --> 01:48:14.879
was just
a fucking documentary.

01:48:15.053 --> 01:48:16.881
But once in a while,
there's a man.

01:48:17.055 --> 01:48:19.754
Sometimes, only one
in 1,000 years.

01:48:19.928 --> 01:48:22.147
- The prophet of the other.
- The other? What other?

01:48:22.931 --> 01:48:24.933
The between one.

01:48:25.107 --> 01:48:26.935
He needs an empty man
to be a bridge

01:48:27.109 --> 01:48:29.328
to the rest of the world.

01:48:29.590 --> 01:48:31.896
He comes to erase
all boundaries.

01:48:32.070 --> 01:48:34.551
The only reality is
there is no reality.

01:48:34.725 --> 01:48:36.771
Except for him.

01:48:36.945 --> 01:48:40.862
His endless, black chaos.

01:48:41.036 --> 01:48:44.300
Ah, things are
gonna slide, man.

01:48:44.561 --> 01:48:46.258
It's gonna be a bloodbath.

01:48:52.917 --> 01:48:55.224
You're coming down
with him already, aren't you?

01:48:57.705 --> 01:48:59.533
You don't even know it.

01:48:59.707 --> 01:49:02.884
You've got the itch
in the brain.

01:49:11.153 --> 01:49:13.547
I'm so sick
of your fucking shit, man.

01:49:15.287 --> 01:49:18.203
I grew up
in San Francisco.

01:49:18.377 --> 01:49:20.162
I just wanna know one thing.
Where's Amanda Quail?

01:49:23.948 --> 01:49:25.559
She's on the bridge.

01:49:25.733 --> 01:49:28.910
Bridge? What bridge?

01:49:29.084 --> 01:49:30.738
There is no bridge.

01:49:30.912 --> 01:49:33.218
Haven't you been fucking listening?

01:51:45.263 --> 01:51:46.874
What is this?

01:52:09.461 --> 01:52:11.115
How do you have this?

01:52:27.392 --> 01:52:29.307
How do you have any of this?

01:52:38.534 --> 01:52:41.102
You're fucking with me.

01:52:57.901 --> 01:52:58.772
Where were you?

01:52:59.381 --> 01:53:01.078
Where were you?

01:53:05.039 --> 01:53:06.344
Coming down with it...

01:53:09.217 --> 01:53:11.741
He transmits, we receive.

01:53:11.915 --> 01:53:13.177
On the third night...

01:53:13.351 --> 01:53:15.919
You've got an itch

01:53:16.093 --> 01:53:17.312
in the brain.

01:53:17.486 --> 01:53:18.792
He finds you.

01:53:19.053 --> 01:53:21.969
On the third night,
he finds you.

01:53:22.143 --> 01:53:23.971
You feel...

01:53:24.145 --> 01:53:25.189
In the brain.

01:53:25.363 --> 01:53:27.017
You feel him.

01:53:29.150 --> 01:53:31.195
He transmits,
we receive.

01:53:51.868 --> 01:53:52.956
Can I help you?

01:53:53.914 --> 01:53:55.480
Yes.

01:53:55.654 --> 01:53:59.136
My name is James Lasombra.
I'm a private detective.

01:53:59.310 --> 01:54:01.617
Been hired
to find someone,

01:54:01.878 --> 01:54:03.097
and I have
reason to believe

01:54:03.271 --> 01:54:04.620
they are a patient
in your hospital.

01:54:04.794 --> 01:54:07.449
So, maybe you could just
tell me about that guy,

01:54:07.623 --> 01:54:09.364
in that room, right there?

01:54:10.974 --> 01:54:13.890
I can't divulge
patient information, sir.

01:54:14.064 --> 01:54:15.936
Of course,
you can't do that.

01:54:16.110 --> 01:54:18.895
Maybe you could just tell
me how long he's been here.

01:54:19.983 --> 01:54:21.855
I could cross him
off my list.

01:54:23.160 --> 01:54:25.032
He's been here
for some time.

01:54:25.206 --> 01:54:26.860
Since before
I started here.

01:54:27.686 --> 01:54:29.210
How long ago was that?

01:54:30.428 --> 01:54:32.039
Almost a year.

01:54:33.431 --> 01:54:34.476
Is he stable?

01:54:35.477 --> 01:54:36.478
Well, he's not
on life support,

01:54:36.652 --> 01:54:37.914
if that's what you mean.

01:54:38.088 --> 01:54:39.960
Oh, but he's
unresponsive?

01:54:41.265 --> 01:54:43.006
He fluctuates between
a three and a nine

01:54:43.180 --> 01:54:44.660
on the Glasgow
Coma Scale.

01:54:46.444 --> 01:54:47.968
Usually, he's a three.

01:54:48.969 --> 01:54:50.318
What does that mean?

01:54:50.492 --> 01:54:53.495
Unresponsive to stimuli,
non-vocal, eyes closed.

01:54:53.669 --> 01:54:56.237
Uh-huh.
Is it common

01:54:56.411 --> 01:54:59.196
for someone who's stable to
be in the ICU for that long?

01:55:00.284 --> 01:55:01.329
No.

01:55:03.244 --> 01:55:05.028
It's not common.

01:55:05.202 --> 01:55:06.900
What makes him
so special?

01:55:10.991 --> 01:55:14.298
He was admitted to Bellevue
23 years ago.

01:55:15.125 --> 01:55:16.257
Five years later,

01:55:16.431 --> 01:55:19.390
he was transferred
to Stockham Health.

01:55:19.564 --> 01:55:22.437
Then a private clinic
in Cedar Rapids,

01:55:22.611 --> 01:55:24.569
until two years ago.

01:55:27.137 --> 01:55:28.660
Then who brought him here?

01:55:28.922 --> 01:55:30.967
I don't know.

01:55:31.141 --> 01:55:34.884
Maybe they were
treating him experimentally

01:55:35.058 --> 01:55:36.277
and he took a turn.

01:55:36.451 --> 01:55:38.540
- Took a turn?
- Took a turn for the worse.

01:55:40.020 --> 01:55:42.022
Maybe he took a turn
for the better.

01:55:43.371 --> 01:55:45.286
Either way,
they sent him on to us.

01:55:46.983 --> 01:55:49.029
I suppose it won't hurt
to tell you.

01:55:51.031 --> 01:55:54.121
As far as I know,
he doesn't have a name.

01:55:54.991 --> 01:55:56.645
- He's a John Doe?
- Mm.

01:55:58.212 --> 01:56:01.215
And who pays John Doe's bills?

01:56:01.389 --> 01:56:03.565
I'm sure
I don't know.

01:56:03.739 --> 01:56:06.698
But he certainly gets
a lot of visitors.

01:56:06.960 --> 01:56:09.527
They come and go all the time.

01:56:09.701 --> 01:56:11.965
There's one in there
with him right now.

01:56:21.409 --> 01:56:23.324
So, what do you think?

01:56:25.369 --> 01:56:28.068
Is he the man
you've been looking for?

01:56:30.287 --> 01:56:31.593
I don't know.

01:56:34.683 --> 01:56:36.163
May I?

01:56:37.425 --> 01:56:39.035
Go right ahead.

01:57:04.408 --> 01:57:05.366
Hello, Amanda.

01:57:07.150 --> 01:57:08.499
Been looking for you.

01:57:08.673 --> 01:57:10.066
Well, you found me.

01:57:22.818 --> 01:57:24.080
Who is he?

01:57:25.429 --> 01:57:26.561
You know who he is.

01:57:26.735 --> 01:57:28.432
No, I don't.

01:57:28.606 --> 01:57:29.955
What's his name?

01:57:30.130 --> 01:57:32.349
I have no idea.

01:57:32.523 --> 01:57:34.656
You can call him
whatever you'd like.

01:57:34.830 --> 01:57:37.311
I like to think of him
as a carrier.

01:57:37.485 --> 01:57:39.661
Because he's like a disease,
in a way.

01:57:39.835 --> 01:57:44.448
But he's also like
a carrier signal, you know?

01:57:44.622 --> 01:57:47.103
Modulated by
an input signal.

01:57:47.277 --> 01:57:49.932
He transmits, we receive.

01:57:50.106 --> 01:57:52.065
And his message is contagious.

01:57:55.807 --> 01:57:57.244
I need to call your mom.

01:58:04.468 --> 01:58:06.122
- Hello?
- Nora, it's me.

01:58:06.296 --> 01:58:07.428
I found Amanda.

01:58:07.602 --> 01:58:09.212
I'm sorry, who is this?

01:58:10.561 --> 01:58:11.649
It's me, James.

01:58:11.823 --> 01:58:12.955
Who are you calling for?

01:58:13.129 --> 01:58:14.217
Nora? Yes?

01:58:14.391 --> 01:58:15.566
It's me.

01:58:15.740 --> 01:58:17.786
Nora, it's me. I'm so sorry.

01:58:17.960 --> 01:58:18.917
It's James. My name... I think you have
the wrong number.

01:58:19.179 --> 01:58:20.658
I'm James.

01:58:25.576 --> 01:58:27.404
What the fuck is going on?

01:58:27.578 --> 01:58:29.711
He's weakening now.

01:58:29.885 --> 01:58:31.669
There's only so long
a human body can withstand

01:58:31.843 --> 01:58:33.671
this kind of power.

01:58:35.499 --> 01:58:37.675
We need to find a replacement.

01:58:41.157 --> 01:58:42.637
And soon.

01:58:43.855 --> 01:58:45.683
Replacement?

01:58:45.857 --> 01:58:47.207
Well, there were 500 years

01:58:47.381 --> 01:58:49.426
between the last carrier
and this one.

01:58:49.600 --> 01:58:52.299
We didn't have
that kind of time.

01:58:52.473 --> 01:58:55.737
So we decided to try something
a little bit radical.

01:58:56.868 --> 01:58:58.696
An experiment.

01:58:58.870 --> 01:59:01.046
What kind of experiment?

01:59:01.221 --> 01:59:02.657
We decided to make one.

01:59:10.621 --> 01:59:12.101
It's getting hard
to tell what's real

01:59:12.275 --> 01:59:14.277
and what's in your head
anymore, isn't it?

01:59:14.451 --> 01:59:16.627
Listen to your thoughts.
You can hear him, can't you?

01:59:16.801 --> 01:59:18.934
Squirming his way in,

01:59:19.195 --> 01:59:20.588
crowding you out.

01:59:20.762 --> 01:59:22.503
Did you know that
the brain can itch?

01:59:24.461 --> 01:59:26.246
Imagine an overwhelming itch

01:59:26.420 --> 01:59:27.812
deep in the base
of your skull.

01:59:28.422 --> 01:59:29.336
That's him.

01:59:29.510 --> 01:59:31.076
You're fucking crazy.

01:59:31.251 --> 01:59:33.427
It's not real.
It's not fucking real.

01:59:33.601 --> 01:59:36.343
Of course it's not,
so why fight it?

01:59:36.517 --> 01:59:38.475
You must detach
from a false reality

01:59:38.649 --> 01:59:40.434
in order to attach
to a new one.

01:59:40.608 --> 01:59:42.175
A stronger one.

01:59:42.349 --> 01:59:43.959
You're fucking crazy.

01:59:44.220 --> 01:59:45.482
I bet you thought
I didn't know about

01:59:45.656 --> 01:59:47.441
your little indiscretion
with my mother.

01:59:47.702 --> 01:59:49.225
No!

01:59:49.399 --> 01:59:51.401
Well, I not only
knew about it,

01:59:51.575 --> 01:59:53.273
I made it happen.

01:59:53.447 --> 01:59:55.710
I wrote it into your script
when we created you.

01:59:57.320 --> 01:59:58.974
What are you talking about?

01:59:59.235 --> 02:00:00.889
What high school
did you go to?

02:00:02.499 --> 02:00:03.805
Crossroads.

02:00:05.285 --> 02:00:06.547
What hospital
were you born in?

02:00:07.678 --> 02:00:10.594
Emancipated Heart.

02:00:10.768 --> 02:00:12.770
- And what day were you born?
- November 7th.

02:00:12.944 --> 02:00:16.818
No, it was three days ago,
remember?

02:00:16.992 --> 02:00:18.689
You spent it alone
in a Mexican restaurant

02:00:18.863 --> 02:00:21.301
and the waiters all
sang you Happy Birthday.

02:00:21.475 --> 02:00:23.694
We made you as a group.

02:00:23.868 --> 02:00:25.566
We wrote up a complete
biography for you,

02:00:25.740 --> 02:00:28.395
and focused on it intently
for several sessions

02:00:28.569 --> 02:00:30.310
to conjure you
into being.

02:00:32.877 --> 02:00:34.227
You are our Tulpa.

02:00:34.792 --> 02:00:37.491
Our Empty Man.

02:00:37.665 --> 02:00:41.408
Thought plus concentration
plus time equals flesh.

02:00:43.540 --> 02:00:44.498
Your flesh.

02:00:47.936 --> 02:00:50.286
We tried once before
but failed.

02:00:50.460 --> 02:00:51.722
The signal can
only penetrate

02:00:51.896 --> 02:00:55.465
through the cracks
of sorrow, grief, and guilt.

02:00:55.639 --> 02:00:58.512
Fear. That's what
we were missing.

02:00:58.686 --> 02:00:59.600
Shut up.

02:00:59.774 --> 02:01:01.645
So we built you that way.

02:01:02.777 --> 02:01:04.561
Shut up!

02:01:04.735 --> 02:01:07.260
What's the worst thing
that's ever happened to you?

02:01:09.349 --> 02:01:12.134
Go on. You can say it.

02:01:15.398 --> 02:01:17.270
Fuck you!

02:01:20.969 --> 02:01:23.493
It was the death of
Allison and Henry, wasn't it?

02:01:29.064 --> 02:01:31.284
The death of your wife
and son.

02:01:36.550 --> 02:01:38.334
And where were you

02:01:39.422 --> 02:01:41.294
when they needed you the most?

02:01:43.034 --> 02:01:46.299
Nothing you do
is in your control.

02:01:46.473 --> 02:01:49.084
You cannot make
your own choices.

02:01:49.345 --> 02:01:52.305
You're not your own man.
You're our man.

02:01:55.438 --> 02:01:57.875
But isn't that
a relief, really?

02:01:58.049 --> 02:02:00.574
Isn't that what
you want most anyway?

02:02:00.748 --> 02:02:02.315
So just let go.

02:02:03.881 --> 02:02:07.885
Wouldn't it be easier
to just let go?

02:02:08.059 --> 02:02:10.453
From the bridge comes the man.

02:02:10.627 --> 02:02:12.890
From the man
comes his thoughts.

02:02:13.064 --> 02:02:14.892
From his thoughts
come the dreams.

02:02:15.066 --> 02:02:16.764
From the dreams
comes the power.

02:02:18.505 --> 02:02:19.897
...thoughts come the dreams.

02:02:20.071 --> 02:02:22.465
From the dreams
comes the power.

02:02:22.639 --> 02:02:24.641
From the power
comes the bridge.

02:02:24.815 --> 02:02:27.165
From the bridge comes the man.

02:02:27.427 --> 02:02:29.472
From the man
come his thoughts.

02:02:29.646 --> 02:02:31.822
From his thoughts
come the dreams.

02:02:31.996 --> 02:02:32.910
From the dreams

02:02:33.084 --> 02:02:34.608
comes the power.

02:02:36.697 --> 02:02:38.873
Is there someone here?

02:02:39.047 --> 02:02:42.355
If you're here now,
show yourself.

02:02:43.530 --> 02:02:45.401
Make yourself
known to us.

02:02:48.056 --> 02:02:49.274
We hear you.

02:02:52.103 --> 02:02:53.453
We're listening.

02:02:54.018 --> 02:02:55.672
Show yourself.

02:02:57.848 --> 02:02:59.372
Show yourself.

02:03:00.460 --> 02:03:01.809
We're listening.

02:03:04.594 --> 02:03:05.856
Show yourself.

02:10:35.392 --> 02:10:37.394
You transmit. We receive.

02:10:37.568 --> 02:10:39.962
You transmit. We receive.
