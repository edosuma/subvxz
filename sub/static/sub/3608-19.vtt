00:02.001 --> 00:03.336
Previously on Lost:

00:03.420 --> 00:06.964
Right here, there's a line.

00:07.049 --> 00:09.008
You cross that line,

00:09.093 --> 00:13.137
we go from misunderstanding
to something else.

00:13.222 --> 00:16.181
- What do I do?
- That button has to be pushed.

00:21.814 --> 00:24.190
I never entered the numbers.

00:24.274 --> 00:26.609
I never pressed the button.

00:26.694 --> 00:28.277
You're lying.

00:28.362 --> 00:30.446
No, I'm done lying.

00:31.615 --> 00:33.700
It's a parachute.

00:50.467 --> 00:52.552
Cereal goes on the left, Bernard.

00:55.097 --> 00:57.974
- So, this isn't bothering you at all?
- What's "this"?

00:58.058 --> 01:01.686
Well, this. This.

01:01.770 --> 01:04.230
Why's a bag of potato chips
gonna bother me?

01:04.313 --> 01:07.108
Aren't you curious
as to where all this came from?

01:07.192 --> 01:09.569
You act like
we just went to the supermarket.

01:09.653 --> 01:14.240
Well, I guess I was raised
never to question my blessings.

01:14.324 --> 01:18.327
I was raised to question
piles of food with weird labels

01:18.412 --> 01:20.538
that just fall out of the sky, Rose.

01:20.622 --> 01:23.666
You're having a bad day.
You don't have to raise your voice.

01:23.751 --> 01:27.253
Bad day? I had seven weeks of bad days
on the other side of the island

01:27.337 --> 01:29.797
trying to stay alive,
so I could get back to you.

01:29.882 --> 01:31.549
But, here...

01:32.342 --> 01:36.095
My God, Rose,
they've built a kitchen on the beach.

01:37.181 --> 01:40.725
- They've given up.
- Given up?

01:40.809 --> 01:43.978
- On what?
- On getting rescued.

02:20.432 --> 02:21.974
Hey.

02:23.143 --> 02:24.894
You gonna get that?

02:44.581 --> 02:46.999
When's the last time
you went in to see him?

02:47.084 --> 02:49.460
Couple hours ago. He was sleeping.

02:49.545 --> 02:53.256
- Did he eat?
- Nope.

02:53.340 --> 02:55.258
That's two days now.

02:55.342 --> 02:59.262
No food. No water. Nothing to say.

03:00.138 --> 03:03.891
I don't know about you,
but I'm tired of waiting.

03:19.408 --> 03:21.409
I hear you've lost your appetite.

03:25.622 --> 03:27.248
OK. Don't talk.

03:28.292 --> 03:31.627
I was never that good
at bedside manner, anyway.

03:31.712 --> 03:36.966
I'm gonna change your dressing. If you
try anything, we've got a problem.

03:50.981 --> 03:52.773
So, Henry...

03:54.192 --> 03:55.318
Henry.

03:55.402 --> 04:01.157
I was thinking about something you were
saying before we found out who you are.

04:02.200 --> 04:04.201
This is gonna sting.

04:06.830 --> 04:11.584
Yeah, you were saying
that if you were one of them,

04:11.668 --> 04:13.669
that you'd lead us into a trap.

04:14.546 --> 04:19.507
Capture our people, force a trade.
Us for you.

04:22.095 --> 04:24.513
Pretty good idea, Henry.

04:24.598 --> 04:29.393
And since you are one of them, I thought
now might be a good time to use it.

04:31.438 --> 04:35.024
I'm going out to the line
that we're not supposed to cross

04:35.108 --> 04:37.777
and telling them that we've got you.

04:37.861 --> 04:40.655
And if they want you back,
it's gonna cost 'em.

04:44.868 --> 04:47.161
And when we get Walt back...

04:50.082 --> 04:53.167
you might just have been
worth all the trouble.

04:57.756 --> 04:59.799
Did you say something?

05:03.220 --> 05:05.221
They'll never give you Walt.

05:37.129 --> 05:40.006
Don't gun it.
You're digging yourself in.

05:40.090 --> 05:42.550
- Just tap the gas, lightly.
- All due respect,

05:42.634 --> 05:45.636
I have driven in snow my whole life.
Mind stepping back?

05:45.721 --> 05:48.556
You have to rock it out.
You're not gonna be able to...

05:53.437 --> 05:57.023
- I'm calling triple A.
- What, so they can send a tow truck?

05:57.107 --> 05:59.191
Trust me, I can do this.

06:04.990 --> 06:07.283
OK. Ease on the gas.

06:08.452 --> 06:10.745
That's it. You're doing great!

06:13.623 --> 06:15.082
Almost!

06:15.876 --> 06:17.877
Go, go, go!

06:20.964 --> 06:22.590
Are you OK?

06:23.800 --> 06:26.844
Oh, yeah. Sure, I'm fine.

06:27.596 --> 06:30.931
Well, you know
I would have gotten it out eventually.

06:31.016 --> 06:34.143
Oh, sure.
July's right around the corner.

06:37.147 --> 06:40.066
Well, thanks for helping me.

06:40.150 --> 06:41.984
Sure.

06:42.069 --> 06:44.445
By the way, I'm Rose.

06:45.197 --> 06:47.907
- Oh... Bernard.
- Yeah.

06:49.659 --> 06:53.704
- OK.
- Oh, OK. Yeah. OK.

06:59.044 --> 07:02.254
- Drive... Drive safe, now, OK?
- Yeah, yeah. You too.

07:12.766 --> 07:16.102
- Bernard?
- Yeah?

07:18.271 --> 07:20.648
Can I buy you a cup of coffee?

07:23.276 --> 07:25.027
Coffee would be nice.

07:25.862 --> 07:28.489
Yeah. OK.

07:35.122 --> 07:39.500
I had to beat back half the group
to get these. I saved them for you.

07:39.584 --> 07:41.544
No way. I'm on a new diet.

07:41.628 --> 07:45.214
Nothing but fish and water and...

07:45.298 --> 07:46.841
fish and water.

07:46.925 --> 07:50.219
Hurley, what are you doing right now?

07:50.303 --> 07:51.971
- Talking to your wife.
- Good.

07:52.055 --> 07:54.974
Can you and Libby meet me
at the tree line in five minutes?

07:55.058 --> 07:58.060
And can you get Jin and Sun,
Jenkins, and that frogurt guy?

07:58.145 --> 08:00.146
- The guy who made frozen yogurt?
- Neil?

08:00.230 --> 08:03.149
Yeah. And Craig,
and anybody else you can get.

08:03.233 --> 08:05.651
Bernard? What are you up to?

08:05.735 --> 08:07.736
I got an idea.

08:08.071 --> 08:11.532
Hey, Richard, Craig, Jerome,
come here. I got a great idea...

08:14.828 --> 08:17.079
I'm not sure trading people's
their thing.

08:17.164 --> 08:19.498
Well, talking to him
is getting us nowhere.

08:19.583 --> 08:22.334
So, maybe we can get something for him.

08:23.420 --> 08:25.421
You want me to come with you?

08:28.758 --> 08:30.509
You need to stay here.

08:35.432 --> 08:37.558
You need it more than I do.

08:40.937 --> 08:42.938
Do yourself a favor, man.

08:43.773 --> 08:46.984
- Don't go out there alone.
- All right.

08:50.030 --> 08:52.156
That's how it's done.

08:52.240 --> 08:53.866
Oh, well, look at you.

08:53.950 --> 08:57.036
What,
that's like four in the last half hour?

08:57.120 --> 08:59.455
Let me call the Guinness book.

08:59.539 --> 09:04.084
You want help or not? 'Cause I've
got better things to do with my time.

09:04.169 --> 09:07.588
Oh, happy day. Here comes Dr. Giggles.

09:09.633 --> 09:11.926
- Hey.
- Hey, yourself.

09:13.136 --> 09:16.555
I'm going back to the jungle
to talk to our friend with the beard.

09:16.640 --> 09:18.974
See if we can make a trade.

09:19.059 --> 09:22.061
Ah, the old prisoner exchange.

09:22.562 --> 09:25.064
You're inviting me along
'cause you want a gun?

09:25.148 --> 09:27.608
I'm not inviting you, I'm inviting Kate.

09:28.610 --> 09:31.237
And I've already got a gun,
but thanks for offering.

09:31.321 --> 09:33.489
How in the hell did you get a gun?

09:33.573 --> 09:35.616
Does it matter?

09:39.204 --> 09:41.038
I'll get my things.

09:45.418 --> 09:48.629
OK, two months we've been
on this island. Two months.

09:48.713 --> 09:50.881
And already we have a water trough,

09:50.966 --> 09:54.009
and we've got a food pantry,

09:54.094 --> 09:58.764
and people are taking showers
in your hatch.

09:58.848 --> 10:02.810
Have you forgotten
that we all crashed on this island?

10:02.894 --> 10:07.189
- It's like none of you want to go home.
- How can you say that? Of course we do.

10:07.274 --> 10:11.360
- Why aren't we doing anything about it?
- Dude, we like built a raft.

10:12.862 --> 10:15.072
But, it got blown up.

10:15.156 --> 10:18.033
OK. So, what are we doing now?

10:18.118 --> 10:21.203
That pallet of food had a parachute,

10:21.288 --> 10:23.205
which means a plane dropped it here,

10:23.290 --> 10:26.750
which means there are other planes
that fly over the island.

10:26.835 --> 10:32.464
So, we are gonna build a sign,
a massive sign along the beach.

10:32.549 --> 10:37.970
So, that way, if a plane flies over or
a satellite takes pictures from up there

10:38.054 --> 10:42.308
we wanna make damn sure
that they know we're here,

10:42.392 --> 10:44.059
that they know about us.

10:44.144 --> 10:48.147
Maybe we should speak
to Jack about this first.

10:49.357 --> 10:52.109
Well, do we have
to run everything by Jack?

10:52.193 --> 10:55.988
I mean, he's not the president.
He's... He's a doctor.

10:56.072 --> 10:58.073
You're a dentist.

11:03.955 --> 11:06.582
Could I speak to you for just a second?

11:07.542 --> 11:09.084
Come here.

11:11.254 --> 11:14.173
Honey, it is just a sign.
I don't see what the harm is.

11:14.257 --> 11:18.469
The harm is you are telling these people
about airplanes and satellites

11:18.553 --> 11:20.637
coming out of nowhere to save the day.

11:20.722 --> 11:24.516
I'm just trying to do something.
I want to get back to our life.

11:24.601 --> 11:28.812
Well, the only thing you are doing
is giving these people false hope.

11:38.948 --> 11:41.033
Excuse me.

11:41.117 --> 11:43.118
I have a sign to build.

11:45.246 --> 11:49.208
All right,
I want to get this going right away.

11:49.292 --> 11:51.293
We've waited long enough.

12:01.137 --> 12:03.305
It's just amazing, isn't it?

12:04.557 --> 12:06.767
Oh, sure, it's beautiful.

12:07.560 --> 12:11.355
- You're not impressed, huh?
- Oh, yeah.

12:11.439 --> 12:16.402
So, what does God have to do
to get your attention?

12:16.486 --> 12:19.613
Bernard? What are you doing?

12:31.501 --> 12:32.668
Rose...

12:34.462 --> 12:36.755
I'd been a bachelor for 56 years.

12:37.674 --> 12:43.595
And then I met you
and we just fell into this rhythm,

12:43.680 --> 12:46.306
like we had known each other forever.

12:47.517 --> 12:50.352
I had always dreamed
of finding somebody like you,

12:50.437 --> 12:52.813
but I'd given up hope that I ever would.

12:52.897 --> 12:55.691
- Bernard...
- I know, I know. It's crazy.

12:57.527 --> 12:59.945
I mean, we just met five months ago.

13:01.197 --> 13:06.702
But five months is long enough,
because I knew after five minutes.

13:11.833 --> 13:13.542
Rose...

13:15.336 --> 13:16.962
I love you.

13:19.174 --> 13:20.966
Will you marry me?

13:26.389 --> 13:28.390
Bernard, I'm dying.

13:33.897 --> 13:36.690
I'm sick, and I'm dying.

13:42.947 --> 13:45.574
Would you excuse us for a minute,
please?

13:58.671 --> 14:03.509
I've been in remission
for the last couple of years,

14:03.593 --> 14:07.054
but now it's back,
and this time it's not going away.

14:08.806 --> 14:12.267
My doctor says I have about a year...

14:13.186 --> 14:15.646
maybe a little longer.

14:31.829 --> 14:34.039
You haven't answered my question.

14:36.209 --> 14:38.752
Are you sure?

14:44.467 --> 14:46.218
Oh, I'm sure.

14:53.768 --> 14:58.564
Yes.

15:05.405 --> 15:09.199
Well, you bunk with a guy for 48 days,
now he doesn't call or write.

15:09.284 --> 15:10.909
Hello, Bernard.

15:11.869 --> 15:15.872
- What have you boys got going up here?
- Just working.

15:15.957 --> 15:21.378
I got a team of folks throwing together
a big sign down along the beach.

15:21.462 --> 15:24.256
Hopefully it'll get us spotted
by a plane or satellite.

15:24.340 --> 15:27.426
We could use all the bodies
we can get to help put it together.

15:27.510 --> 15:29.344
Sorry, I'm busy.

15:31.139 --> 15:32.931
- Charlie?
- Regrets, Bernard,

15:33.016 --> 15:36.727
I've only got two hands, you know?
Good luck, though.

15:39.606 --> 15:41.773
Could I at least
grab some of these logs?

15:41.858 --> 15:44.192
- We could sure use...
- We're using them.

15:44.277 --> 15:47.070
- For what, exactly?
- A church.

15:49.907 --> 15:52.284
- A church?
- Yes.

15:53.411 --> 15:56.413
Everybody on this island
is building something.

15:56.497 --> 15:58.540
I'm trying to get us saved.

16:00.084 --> 16:02.961
People are saved in different ways,
Bernard.

16:04.881 --> 16:08.884
I think I liked you better when
you just hit people with your stick.

16:12.889 --> 16:14.973
I like you just the way you are.

16:46.130 --> 16:48.340
I need to talk to him.

16:48.424 --> 16:51.426
The gun's with Jack.
The door stays closed.

16:53.930 --> 16:56.348
But if you wanna talk to him,
talk to him.

17:10.863 --> 17:12.906
Henry, can you hear me?

17:16.911 --> 17:18.537
It's John, Henry.

17:26.713 --> 17:29.381
Henry, did you enter the numbers?

17:32.135 --> 17:34.428
Did you push the button or not?

17:36.389 --> 17:40.600
Henry! I need to know!
I want you to answer me!

17:42.437 --> 17:43.770
Answer me!

17:44.856 --> 17:46.940
Answer me, you hear me?

18:01.748 --> 18:04.124
What happened to everybody?

18:04.208 --> 18:06.877
Where's Craig? Where's Frogurt?

18:08.421 --> 18:13.091
OK, all right, moving on. We're gonna
put this sign across this entire beach.

18:13.176 --> 18:18.430
Which means the letters
have to be really big, about 40 feet.

18:18.514 --> 18:23.268
These black rocks will get
maximum contrast with the sand.

18:23.352 --> 18:25.687
Dude, we're gonna need a lot more rocks.

18:25.772 --> 18:29.399
Yes, Hurley,
we are gonna need a lot more rocks.

18:29.484 --> 18:33.236
There's a lava field about half a mile
inland that's loaded with them.

18:33.321 --> 18:35.280
We'll haul them out in two-man teams.

18:35.364 --> 18:37.240
So, you guys double up,

18:37.325 --> 18:41.995
and I am gonna start sketching out
the letters in the sand. Let's do this.

18:42.079 --> 18:44.539
Hey, I can sketch the letters.

18:44.624 --> 18:47.959
Everybody's got a job, Hurley.
I do my job, you do yours.

18:51.172 --> 18:53.715
- What? What did he say?
- I think he's not so crazy

18:53.800 --> 18:56.885
about the whole
carry-the-rocks-a-half-mile thing.

18:56.969 --> 18:59.638
OK. Look, this is gonna take time,

18:59.722 --> 19:04.643
but if this is the thing that gets us
off this place, isn't that worth it?

19:04.727 --> 19:07.062
Rome wasn't built in a day, you know.

19:07.688 --> 19:11.274
No, you don't know. OK, all right,
let's get started. Come on.

19:15.947 --> 19:17.155
We're lost.

19:17.240 --> 19:19.908
You saying we're lost
doesn't make us lost.

19:19.992 --> 19:22.118
I know exactly where we are.

19:22.203 --> 19:23.870
Me, too.

19:23.955 --> 19:27.290
Driving around in circles
in the middle of the outback.

19:28.334 --> 19:31.795
That's why I wanted to be on a beach
for our honeymoon.

19:34.382 --> 19:36.758
Thank goodness, civilization.

19:37.510 --> 19:39.302
Bernard, let's get directions.

19:39.387 --> 19:41.513
Oh, I don't need directions.

19:41.597 --> 19:43.557
I told you, honey, we're not lost.

19:45.560 --> 19:48.103
Bernard, what's going on?

19:49.397 --> 19:54.025
I brought you out here
because I want you to see this man.

19:54.861 --> 20:00.073
His name is Isaac of Uluru,
and he's helped hundreds of people.

20:00.992 --> 20:04.578
Now, I know how it looks but,
believe me, he is completely legit.

20:05.371 --> 20:09.624
Bernard,
you brought me to a faith healer?

20:15.548 --> 20:17.966
He's the real deal, Rose.

20:18.050 --> 20:20.760
Once I started telling people
about your situation,

20:20.845 --> 20:22.721
I got three calls recommending him.

20:22.805 --> 20:24.973
My "situation"?

20:26.225 --> 20:29.394
This is why you wanted
to come to Australia?

20:29.478 --> 20:33.481
- To bring me to some kind of a kook?
- No, he's not.

20:33.566 --> 20:36.651
I made a $10,000 donation
just to get you in to see him.

20:36.736 --> 20:39.654
- Normally...
- I didn't ask for this!

20:48.497 --> 20:50.081
This is...

20:54.795 --> 20:56.254
Bernard...

20:57.340 --> 21:01.384
I have made my peace
with what's happening to me.

21:05.431 --> 21:07.557
Well, I haven't.

21:09.185 --> 21:11.519
I can't just do nothing, Rose.

21:12.980 --> 21:15.357
That's not me. That's not who I am.

21:16.692 --> 21:18.652
I have to try.

21:20.988 --> 21:23.531
Will you try, Rose?

21:27.078 --> 21:29.079
For me.

21:35.378 --> 21:37.796
It's gonna be great. A really big sign.

21:37.880 --> 21:39.297
That's great, Bernard.

21:39.382 --> 21:43.051
If you have time to fix your hut,
you have time to move some rocks.

21:44.178 --> 21:46.137
Come on, we could really use your help.

21:46.222 --> 21:50.141
What? You got union trouble
down at the sand factory, Norma Rae?

21:52.061 --> 21:55.105
Come on, Sawyer. I need your help.

21:55.189 --> 21:57.482
Now, what do you say?

21:57.566 --> 22:01.069
I say... Pasadena.

22:15.918 --> 22:18.962
- Well, I hope you're happy.
- About what?

22:19.046 --> 22:23.091
This morning I had 15 people willing to
work on the sign. Now I'm down to four.

22:23.175 --> 22:25.343
And how is that my fault?

22:25.428 --> 22:28.388
At the very least,
I expected your support.

22:28.472 --> 22:30.223
You had to go and attack me.

22:30.307 --> 22:34.019
Have you ever stopped to think,
maybe the reason people are quitting

22:34.103 --> 22:37.355
is because you've got yourself
a management problem?

22:39.567 --> 22:42.360
What is the matter with you, Rose?

22:42.445 --> 22:44.279
I am just trying to do something.

22:44.363 --> 22:46.865
That's right.
You're always trying to do.

22:46.949 --> 22:49.617
Why can't you just let things be?

22:51.704 --> 22:55.331
If I didn't always have to do something,
you wouldn't be here.

23:21.609 --> 23:23.276
I'm flattered.

23:24.320 --> 23:25.904
Yeah? Why is that?

23:25.988 --> 23:29.074
Because you chose me to go with you
instead of Sawyer.

23:29.992 --> 23:32.827
I asked Sayid first,
but he turned me down.

23:34.330 --> 23:38.041
And I only asked you
because they don't want you.

23:38.125 --> 23:41.127
They grabbed you, had you at gunpoint.

23:41.212 --> 23:43.588
They coulda kept you, but they didn't.

23:43.672 --> 23:46.883
Then again,
they didn't really want me either.

23:46.967 --> 23:50.929
Damaged goods... both of us.

24:04.110 --> 24:06.111
What's that?

24:10.366 --> 24:11.658
Kate...

24:13.744 --> 24:16.079
- It's a doll.
- Wait, don't!

24:18.290 --> 24:19.791
Don't! Don't!

24:27.133 --> 24:28.508
Sorry.

24:37.351 --> 24:40.145
- You OK?
- Yeah.

24:40.229 --> 24:42.230
Oh, good, so you can hear me.

24:44.650 --> 24:46.359
This isn't one of theirs.

24:46.443 --> 24:49.028
No, it's not sophisticated enough.

24:49.697 --> 24:53.449
Must be one of Rousseau's traps.
Hopefully she's not far from here.

24:53.534 --> 24:56.119
Could be a week before she shows up.

24:58.122 --> 25:01.166
- What are you doing?
- I'm trying to get the gun.

25:01.250 --> 25:05.461
- I can't get my arm around.
- All right, here, let me...

25:05.546 --> 25:06.838
All right.

25:11.385 --> 25:14.262
Sorry, I don't want to shoot you.

25:16.015 --> 25:17.098
OK.

25:17.183 --> 25:18.433
You got it?

25:18.517 --> 25:20.143
- OK, ready?
- Yeah.

25:20.227 --> 25:22.353
Got it! Got it, got it, got it!

25:23.355 --> 25:26.482
- Got it.
- All right. Now, give me the gun.

25:26.567 --> 25:29.861
- Why? What for?
- I'm gonna try to shoot the rope.

25:33.949 --> 25:36.201
- Whoa! Hey!
- I'm a better shot than you.

25:36.285 --> 25:37.452
Oh, really?

25:37.536 --> 25:40.622
Yeah. I told you,
I grew up hunting with my dad.

25:47.379 --> 25:48.671
Damn it!

25:48.756 --> 25:52.050
Well, at least they know where we are.
OK, now, give me the gun.

25:52.134 --> 25:55.011
- Are you gonna waste another bullet?
- Don't worry.

25:55.095 --> 25:58.014
We'll still have 13 more
to shoot each other with. Come on.

25:58.098 --> 26:01.309
Fine.
You have a better angle than I anyway.

26:01.393 --> 26:04.229
Oh, that's gonna be your excuse
when I make the shot?

26:04.313 --> 26:06.481
When you make the shot.

26:10.444 --> 26:11.819
OK.

26:22.998 --> 26:24.791
Nice shot.

26:27.920 --> 26:30.463
No! No-no-no-no-no!

26:30.547 --> 26:32.423
You're doing it all wrong!

26:32.508 --> 26:34.676
I told you, three rows!

26:35.511 --> 26:38.388
Three, so they can see it from the air!

26:40.683 --> 26:43.559
Three rows. How hard is that?

26:47.690 --> 26:50.149
Do I just have to do everything myself?

26:53.862 --> 26:56.489
No. No-no-no! No, Jin! No, wait.

26:57.533 --> 26:58.866
Please.

26:59.868 --> 27:03.371
I just want to get my wife home.

27:04.999 --> 27:06.332
Rose.

27:08.585 --> 27:11.087
I want to get Rose home.

27:16.176 --> 27:17.593
Sorry.

27:34.778 --> 27:36.946
You're in my spot.

27:40.826 --> 27:42.243
I can move.

27:43.245 --> 27:46.581
- Can you?
- Oh, that's funny.

27:48.375 --> 27:52.837
I guess your sense of humor got trapped
under that door with your leg.

27:56.467 --> 28:00.511
I saw your husband walking
through the jungle, hauling rocks.

28:02.097 --> 28:07.852
He's building a big sign in the sand,
so the satellites will see it.

28:09.772 --> 28:14.400
That man doesn't know the difference
between an errand and a fool's errand.

28:17.321 --> 28:19.614
Well, Rose, most of us don't.

28:20.949 --> 28:23.034
So, what are you doing down here, John?

28:23.118 --> 28:26.579
Can't remember the last time
I saw you out of that hatch.

28:28.957 --> 28:30.958
I'm done with the hatch.

28:31.668 --> 28:33.920
Oh, now, you're just frustrated.

28:34.004 --> 28:39.884
You'll be out of that splint and running
around the island again in no time.

28:39.968 --> 28:43.221
And yet, Jack said
it'd be at least four weeks.

28:44.139 --> 28:48.476
But, honey, you and I both know
it's not gonna take that long.

29:06.537 --> 29:08.788
Right this way, Rose.

29:12.292 --> 29:16.295
Please, make yourself comfortable.
Isaac will be right with you.

29:41.029 --> 29:43.156
You must be Rose.

29:44.450 --> 29:46.534
Why don't you have a seat?

29:51.039 --> 29:54.041
So, how does this work?

29:54.918 --> 30:00.465
I sit here and you chant
or pray or what?

30:01.550 --> 30:04.093
There are certain places
with great energy,

30:04.178 --> 30:07.972
spots on the Earth
like the one we're above now.

30:08.056 --> 30:12.518
Perhaps this energy
is geological, magnetic...

30:14.438 --> 30:16.772
or perhaps it's something else.

30:17.608 --> 30:19.650
And, when possible,

30:19.735 --> 30:24.071
I harness this energy
and give it to others.

30:25.616 --> 30:27.408
May I?

30:47.554 --> 30:48.763
What...

30:49.681 --> 30:51.432
What... What is it?

30:53.810 --> 30:55.436
I'm sorry.

30:58.440 --> 31:00.483
I can't do anything for you, Rose.

31:04.404 --> 31:06.447
I didn't expect you to.

31:14.081 --> 31:16.040
It's not that you can't be healed.

31:16.792 --> 31:20.920
Like I said...
there's different energies.

31:21.797 --> 31:24.173
This is not the right place for you.

31:25.300 --> 31:27.510
Where is the right place?

31:29.388 --> 31:31.180
I wish I knew.

31:33.308 --> 31:36.477
- I'll return your husband's donation...
- Don't.

31:39.481 --> 31:41.732
I'm gonna tell him you fixed me.

31:47.948 --> 31:50.866
I'm going to tell him you fixed me.

32:05.549 --> 32:07.550
What did you mean back there?

32:08.552 --> 32:11.262
- What?
- In the net.

32:11.346 --> 32:14.307
You said they were sophisticated,
the Others.

32:17.978 --> 32:23.608
Last week when the baby got sick,
Claire and I went into the jungle,

32:23.692 --> 32:25.818
and found another hatch.

32:26.361 --> 32:29.614
- What?
- Like a medical station.

32:29.698 --> 32:33.618
There was nothing you could use,
it was all cleared out. But...

32:33.702 --> 32:38.581
I found some lockers. They had clothes
inside, all worn and dirty,

32:38.665 --> 32:42.084
but they were on hangers,
like costumes, you know?

32:42.169 --> 32:44.920
And there was a makeup kit...

32:46.381 --> 32:48.674
and a fake beard.

32:50.177 --> 32:51.969
When were you gonna tell me this?

32:52.971 --> 32:55.514
When you decided
to let me back in the club.

32:58.268 --> 32:59.810
What?

32:59.895 --> 33:04.440
You can keep one of them locked up in
the hatch for a week and say nothing,

33:04.524 --> 33:06.525
but then when I...

33:09.237 --> 33:10.821
We're here.

33:12.199 --> 33:13.491
Are you sure? I...

33:13.575 --> 33:16.202
That's where
they took the shot at Sawyer.

33:17.204 --> 33:21.749
Over there is where they pushed you out
of the jungle with a bag on your head.

33:21.833 --> 33:24.043
And right there is where I...

33:25.087 --> 33:27.088
where I laid my guns down.

33:33.762 --> 33:34.804
Hey!

33:37.432 --> 33:39.100
Hey, I'm back!

33:41.770 --> 33:43.562
You say you're watching us?

33:44.356 --> 33:46.440
You hear me?

33:46.525 --> 33:48.442
We've got your man.

33:49.820 --> 33:52.947
You want him back,
you're gonna have to come out here.

33:55.450 --> 33:57.410
Come on out!

33:57.494 --> 33:59.120
- Jack!
- I know you're there!

33:59.204 --> 34:02.957
- I know you can hear me.
- Jack, they're not here.

34:03.041 --> 34:06.252
I'll be right here until you talk to me.

34:08.045 --> 34:10.047
I'll be right here.

34:28.775 --> 34:30.985
I brought you some supper.

34:32.154 --> 34:34.405
Thanks. You can just set it down there.

34:40.454 --> 34:42.746
Where is everybody?

34:49.212 --> 34:51.589
I owe you an apology.

34:51.672 --> 34:55.342
You don't have anything to be sorry for.
It's my fault I'm here by myself.

34:55.427 --> 34:57.803
That's not why I'm apologizing.

35:00.849 --> 35:02.850
I lied to you.

35:05.270 --> 35:09.231
Back in Australia...
Isaac, he didn't heal me.

35:11.193 --> 35:13.027
He didn't do anything.

35:15.989 --> 35:21.327
- Of course he did. You're...
- Bernard, he didn't heal me.

35:23.246 --> 35:25.831
But that doesn't mean I'm not healed.

35:30.086 --> 35:35.341
When you're sick and you have something
inside you that doesn't belong there,

35:35.425 --> 35:37.468
you can feel it.

35:38.178 --> 35:42.890
And after the crash...
I couldn't feel it anymore.

35:45.185 --> 35:47.311
At first I thought it was just shock...

35:50.690 --> 35:52.733
but it wasn't.

35:55.695 --> 35:57.655
It's this place.

36:00.867 --> 36:02.660
But you said Isaac fixed you.

36:02.744 --> 36:04.495
I told you that,

36:04.579 --> 36:10.376
so that you wouldn't spend what time
we had left trying to do something.

36:15.924 --> 36:18.509
Rose, you could just be in remission.

36:18.593 --> 36:21.011
How do you know
it wasn't Isaac who healed you?

36:21.096 --> 36:23.764
- How do you know he didn't heal you?
- I know.

36:27.269 --> 36:28.811
I know.

36:43.618 --> 36:45.703
These yours?

36:46.830 --> 36:48.372
Thank you.

36:50.750 --> 36:52.585
You're welcome.

36:57.799 --> 36:59.800
Trust me.

37:01.094 --> 37:03.095
I know.

37:10.645 --> 37:13.230
You don't want to be rescued, do you?

37:15.817 --> 37:20.029
You think if you leave, it'll come back.

37:24.367 --> 37:26.410
And if you can't leave...

37:29.664 --> 37:31.665
neither can I.

37:36.630 --> 37:38.756
We won't ever leave, Rose.

37:52.354 --> 37:53.854
I would...

37:54.731 --> 37:59.318
I would offer to take down the sign,
but we didn't get very far.

38:27.055 --> 38:28.847
Hey.

38:29.766 --> 38:30.975
Hi.

38:33.728 --> 38:35.479
I pressed your button.

38:37.065 --> 38:38.899
It's not my button.

38:42.195 --> 38:44.154
Where did you go?

38:45.740 --> 38:50.577
I just needed to... stretch my legs.

40:58.248 --> 41:00.541
How long are you gonna wait, Jack?

41:02.710 --> 41:04.545
Until I get my voice back.

41:04.629 --> 41:06.880
And then I'm gonna yell some more.

41:12.178 --> 41:14.138
Maybe they can't hear you.

41:15.890 --> 41:17.891
They can hear me.

41:24.566 --> 41:26.692
I'm sorry I kissed you.

41:36.452 --> 41:38.328
I'm not.

42:20.622 --> 42:22.039
Michael!
