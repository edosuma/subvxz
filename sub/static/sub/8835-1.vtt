WEBVTT

00:59.185 --> 01:01.187
Laura: IF I HAD
A REMEMBRANCE BOOK,

01:01.187 --> 01:04.232
I WOULD SURELY WRITE ABOUT
THE DAY WE CAME TO PLUM CREEK

01:04.232 --> 01:07.068
AND FIRST SAW THE HOUSE
IN THE GROUND.

01:39.392 --> 01:42.187
I CAN REMEMBER
PA AND MR. HANSON

01:42.187 --> 01:46.065
AND HOW THEY WALKED
AND LOOKED AND TALKED

01:46.065 --> 01:48.735
AND HOW WE WONDERED
WHAT THEY SAID.

01:51.613 --> 01:54.240
YOU KNOW, THERE IS
NO HURRY, MR. INGALLS.

01:54.240 --> 01:57.452
IF I WERE IN YOUR BOOTS, I WOULD
THINK ON IT AND SLEEP ON IT.

01:57.452 --> 01:59.537
NOTHING TO THINK ABOUT, MR. HANSON.
MY MIND'S MADE UP.

01:59.537 --> 02:02.081
I'LL BE IN WALNUT GROVE TOMORROW
MORNING TO SIGN THE PAPERS.

02:02.081 --> 02:04.459
ALL RIGHT,
I'LL BE AT THE MILL.

02:04.459 --> 02:06.085
- I'LL SEE YOU THEN.
- RIGHT.

02:06.085 --> 02:07.962
- AND THANK YOU.
- THANK YOU.

02:18.515 --> 02:22.644
WELL, INGALLS FAMILY, SOON AS
YOU GET DONE SOAKING YOUR FEET,

02:22.644 --> 02:24.854
WE GOT A WAGON
TO UNLOAD.

02:24.854 --> 02:27.023
WE'RE HOME?

02:28.525 --> 02:30.360
WE'RE HOME.

02:59.055 --> 03:03.434
Laura: PA LEFT PLUM CREEK AT DAYBREAK
AND WORKED ALL DAY IN HANSON'S MILL

03:03.434 --> 03:06.187
EARNING LUMBER HE NEEDED
TO BUILD US A HOUSE.

03:08.147 --> 03:10.233
PET AND PATTY,
OUR TEAM HORSES,

03:10.233 --> 03:14.654
WEREN'T BIG ENOUGH TO PULL THE PLOW
PA NEEDED TO BREAK THE PRAIRIE SOD.

03:14.654 --> 03:16.823
THOUGH WE WERE SORRY
TO SEE THEM GO,

03:16.823 --> 03:20.243
PA SWAPPED THEM TO MR.
HANSON FOR A SPAN OF OXEN,

03:20.243 --> 03:25.206
STRONG ENOUGH PA SAID TO PULL THE
STATE OF IOWA 10 MILES INTO MINNESOTA

03:25.206 --> 03:28.835
IF YOU COULD FIND
A PLACE TO HITCH THEM TO.

03:28.835 --> 03:30.962
[HAMMERING]

03:34.549 --> 03:38.845
PA CAME HOME AT SUNSET, AND THEN
HE WORKED BY LANTERN LIGHT.

03:38.845 --> 03:42.181
MA SAID HE ATE HIS SUPPER
WHILE HE WAS WORKING,

03:42.181 --> 03:44.392
AND ALMOST IT WAS TRUE.

03:44.392 --> 03:46.686
BECAUSE IT HAPPENED
MOSTLY IN THE DARK,

03:46.686 --> 03:49.856
OUR HOUSE GREW LIKE THE MUSHROOMS
WE FOUND IN THE WOODS.

03:52.859 --> 03:55.612
IT WAS KIND OF LIKE WE WERE
ALL HOLDING OUR BREATH

03:55.612 --> 03:59.574
AND THEN ONE DAY OUR NEW HOUSE
WAS THERE, ALL DONE,

03:59.574 --> 04:01.659
AND IT WAS MOVING-IN DAY.

04:08.374 --> 04:10.043
CAN WE GO IN NOW?

04:10.043 --> 04:11.586
NOT JUST YET.

04:11.586 --> 04:13.504
CHARLES!

04:13.504 --> 04:14.714
[GIGGLES]

04:14.714 --> 04:16.883
WE'VE ALL BEEN IN
THE HOUSE 100 TIMES.

04:16.883 --> 04:19.594
NO, BUT NOT TODAY.
TODAY'S SPECIAL.

04:25.433 --> 04:28.019
CAN WE GO MAKE
OUR BED?

04:28.019 --> 04:29.103
OF COURSE.

04:29.103 --> 04:30.605
DON'T FORGET
YOUR PILLOWS.

04:44.661 --> 04:48.289
Mary: OUR NEW BED'S WAY BIGGER THAN
OUR OTHER ONE AND SOFTER, TOO.

04:48.289 --> 04:51.250
THIS IS THE BEST HOUSE
WE'VE EVER HAD.

04:55.254 --> 05:00.218
WE HAVE OUR OWN WINDOW,
AND WE CAN SEE THE STARS.

05:00.218 --> 05:03.262
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE SLEEPING
WHEN THE STARS ARE OUT,

05:03.262 --> 05:05.848
AND IT WILL SURE BE NICER TO
HEAR THE RAIN ON THE ROOF

05:05.848 --> 05:09.227
THAN TO HAVE
IT GET US ALL WET.

05:09.227 --> 05:12.438
COME ON, YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO
BE HELPING ME MAKE THE BED.

05:12.438 --> 05:14.649
OUR OWN WINDOW.

05:14.649 --> 05:19.320
A WOOD FLOOR.
REAL GLASS WINDOWS.

05:19.320 --> 05:23.366
A ROOM FOR THE GIRLS,
AND ONE FOR US.

05:23.366 --> 05:25.952
DON'T FORGET--
A DOOR THAT LOCKS.

05:25.952 --> 05:27.453
THAT, TOO.

05:27.453 --> 05:30.331
NOW IF I HEAR WOLVES AT
NIGHT, I WON'T BE AFRAID.

05:30.331 --> 05:32.375
WE'VE HEARD THEM
LOTS TIMES BEFORE.

05:32.375 --> 05:34.377
IF YOU WERE AFRAID
I NEVER KNEW IT.

05:34.377 --> 05:36.796
I WAS, BUT
I WON'T BE NOW.

05:36.796 --> 05:38.756
AT LEAST WE DON'T HAVE
TO FEAR THE WEATHER.

05:38.756 --> 05:41.926
STILL HAVE A MOUNTAIN OF WORK TO
DO AND LOTS OF THINGS WE NEED.

05:41.926 --> 05:44.429
A PLOW, A HARROW,
AND SEED.

05:44.429 --> 05:45.388
CARRIE!

05:45.388 --> 05:49.308
UH-OH. HEY!
COME ON NOW, MUNCH.

05:49.308 --> 05:52.020
YOUR ROOM'S
DOWNSTAIRS, OK?

05:53.271 --> 05:55.189
I'M NOT TOO WORRIED
ABOUT THE HARROW.

05:55.189 --> 05:57.400
I CAN MAKE ONE THAT WILL WORK
TILL I CAN GET A STORE-BOUGHT.

05:57.400 --> 05:58.860
BUT PLOW AND SEED--

05:58.860 --> 06:00.862
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO WORK
THAT OUT IN TOWN TOMORROW.

06:00.862 --> 06:02.655
HOW? WE HAVE
NO CASH.

06:02.655 --> 06:05.450
WELL, I'LL WORK IT OUT. YOU LET
ME WORRY ABOUT IT, ALL RIGHT?

06:05.450 --> 06:07.452
ALL RIGHT.

06:07.452 --> 06:09.037
CARRIE!

06:10.747 --> 06:12.665
I'LL GET HER.

06:12.665 --> 06:13.916
HI.

06:13.916 --> 06:16.335
Mary: CARRIE, YOU'RE NOT
SUPPOSED TO BE UP HERE.

06:16.335 --> 06:17.754
HOW'D SHE CLIMB
THE LADDER?

06:17.754 --> 06:19.797
Pa: WHAT ARE YOU CLIMBING
AROUND THE HOUSE FOR?

06:19.797 --> 06:21.299
YOU KNOW YOU'RE NOT
SUPPOSED TO DO THAT.

06:21.299 --> 06:23.176
GUESS SHE HAD TO SEE
WHAT WAS UP HERE THOUGH.

06:23.176 --> 06:24.427
BED ALL RIGHT?

06:24.427 --> 06:26.012
IT'S SOFT.

06:26.012 --> 06:27.138
Mary:
I LOVE IT, PA.

06:27.138 --> 06:30.516
GOOD. HERE,
LET ME TRY IT.

06:30.516 --> 06:34.854
OH, HEY, IT'S PRETTY NICE
IF I DO SAY SO MYSELF.

06:34.854 --> 06:36.189
HOW DO YOU LIKE
YOUR ROOM?

06:36.189 --> 06:37.356
IT'S WONDERFUL.

06:37.356 --> 06:39.817
YEAH. AND I'VE
DECIDED SOMETHING.

06:39.817 --> 06:41.360
WHAT'S THAT,
HALF-PINT?

06:41.360 --> 06:44.072
HOME IS THE NICEST
WORD THERE IS.

06:44.072 --> 06:46.449
ONE OF THE NICEST,
THAT'S FOR SURE.

06:50.369 --> 06:51.746
YOU LIKE HOME?

06:51.746 --> 06:53.414
GOOD.

06:53.414 --> 06:55.625
'CAUSE WE GOT ONE NOW.

07:03.716 --> 07:04.842
MORNING.
WORKING HARD?

07:04.842 --> 07:07.261
MORNING, INGALLS.
NOT TOO HARD.

07:34.914 --> 07:37.208
MR. INGALLS,
GOOD MORNING.

07:37.208 --> 07:38.459
MR. OLESON,
HOW YOU DOING?

07:38.459 --> 07:40.628
THIS IS THE FELLA
I TOLD YOU ABOUT

07:40.628 --> 07:42.255
I RAN INTO
OVER AT HANSON'S MILL.

07:42.255 --> 07:43.631
MA'AM.

07:43.631 --> 07:44.882
WHAT CAN I DO
FOR YOU?

07:44.882 --> 07:46.342
WELL, I'D LIKE A PLOW
AND WHEAT SEED,

07:46.342 --> 07:47.760
ENOUGH FOR 100 ACRES.

07:47.760 --> 07:49.679
I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE
BUILDING A HOUSE OUT THERE.

07:49.679 --> 07:51.264
GOT IT ALL FINISHED
YESTERDAY.

07:51.264 --> 07:53.558
START BREAKING SOD SOON
AS I CAN GET THAT PLOW.

07:53.558 --> 07:56.269
I, UH, I DON'T HAVE
ANY MONEY RIGHT NOW.

07:56.269 --> 07:58.271
I'D LIKE TO PLEDGE
A SHARE ON MY FIRST CROP.

07:58.271 --> 08:01.107
WE DO GIVE CREDIT
TO A FEW FARMERS

08:01.107 --> 08:02.608
THAT WE'VE KNOWN
FOR A LONG TIME,

08:02.608 --> 08:04.443
BUT ONLY TO
A FEW OF THEM.

08:04.443 --> 08:08.281
THERE IS A REASON. WE NEED
THE MONEY TO BUY THE THINGS

08:08.281 --> 08:09.782
THAT WE NEED TO
KEEP IN BUSINESS.

08:09.782 --> 08:11.617
I UNDERSTAND.
CASH ON A BARREL,

08:11.617 --> 08:13.452
AND THAT'S THE WAY
I LIKE TO DEAL AND WHEEL,

08:13.452 --> 08:15.371
JUST AS SOON AS I GET
THAT FIRST CROP TO SELL.

08:15.371 --> 08:19.625
MR. INGALLS, DO YOU KNOW HOW
MANY FAMILIES MOVE OUT HERE

08:19.625 --> 08:24.088
AND PLANT THEIR CROPS AND RUN UP MORE
BILLS THAN THEY CAN HOPE TO PAY FOR

08:24.088 --> 08:26.507
AND THEN SKIP OUT IN
THE DEAD OF NIGHT? HMM?

08:26.507 --> 08:29.093
NOW, I COULD SHOW YOU
A WHOLE DRAWER FULL--

08:29.093 --> 08:31.512
MRS. OLESON, I CAN ASSURE
YOU I HAD NO INTENTION OF

08:31.512 --> 08:32.930
RUNNING OUT IN THE
MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.

08:32.930 --> 08:34.390
THANK YOU.

08:34.390 --> 08:37.226
MR. INGALLS, I-- THERE'S
REALLY NO WAY THAT I CAN--

08:37.226 --> 08:38.853
I UNDERSTAND.

10:02.687 --> 10:05.439
LOOKING AT MY
FINE PLOWS, ARE YOU?

10:05.439 --> 10:06.399
YEAH.

10:06.399 --> 10:07.441
WOULD YOU BE
NEEDING ONE?

10:07.441 --> 10:08.693
SURE COULD.
NAME'S INGALLS.

10:08.693 --> 10:10.611
LIAM O'NEIL.
PLEASED TO KNOW YOU.

10:10.611 --> 10:12.738
YEAH, I NEED A PLOW AND
SEED, ENOUGH FOR 100 ACRES.

10:12.738 --> 10:14.198
WELL, YOU'VE COME
TO THE RIGHT MAN.

10:14.198 --> 10:15.574
I SELL ONLY
THE BEST.

10:15.574 --> 10:17.034
I DON'T HAVE ANY CASH.

10:17.034 --> 10:19.036
THEN I'LL THANK YOU
FOR NOT WASTING MY TIME.

10:19.036 --> 10:20.746
YEAH, I GOT SOMETHING
YOU NEED MORE THAN MONEY.

10:20.746 --> 10:22.331
HAVE YOU NOW?

10:22.331 --> 10:25.209
WELL, WHAT IS IT THAT I COULD
NEED OR USE MORE THAN MONEY?

10:25.209 --> 10:28.754
KNOW-HOW. ENOUGH TO PUT
A NEW ROOF ON THAT SHED.

10:33.801 --> 10:36.679
IF IT HAD BEEN BUILT PROPER,
IT WOULD HAVE NEVER CAVED IN.

10:36.679 --> 10:40.224
I BOUGHT THIS BUSINESS FOR CASH, AND
I'D NO SOONER TURNED THE MONEY OVER

10:40.224 --> 10:43.811
THEN THE LAST SNOWS OF WINTER CAME,
AND THEY CRASHED IN THE ROOF.

10:43.811 --> 10:47.106
I'LL BUILD YOU A ROOF THAT
WILL SUPPORT UNDER ANY SNOW.

10:47.106 --> 10:49.525
FOR A PLOW AND SEED.

10:49.525 --> 10:51.402
THAT'S RIGHT.

10:51.402 --> 10:53.863
AND WHO'LL BE
SUPPLYING THE MATERIAL?

10:53.863 --> 10:55.656
WELL, YOU WILL.

10:55.656 --> 11:00.745
WELL, IN THAT CASE, ME LAD, I'LL
BE NEEDING A BIT MORE ON MY SIDE

11:00.745 --> 11:02.288
TO MAKE THE BARGAIN EVEN.

11:02.288 --> 11:07.293
I'M FREIGHTING IN SOME SACKS
OF GRAIN FROM MANKATO.

11:07.293 --> 11:10.880
YOU'D BE STACKING THOSE IN
THE SHED AND NEATLY, TOO.

11:10.880 --> 11:12.381
CONSIDER IT DONE.

11:12.381 --> 11:15.926
SATISFY ME ON ONE THING MORE
AND WE CAN SHAKE HANDS ON IT.

11:15.926 --> 11:18.304
I SEE YOU WORKING
AT HANSON'S EVERY DAY.

11:18.304 --> 11:19.972
HOW YOU GOING TO GET
LOOSE TO WORK FOR ME?

11:19.972 --> 11:21.640
ALREADY ARRANGED
FOR THAT.

11:21.640 --> 11:23.309
WORK FOR YOU IN THE MORNING, WORK
FOR HANSON IN THE AFTERNOON.

11:23.309 --> 11:25.436
YOU'RE BITING OFF
A BIG PIECE.

11:25.436 --> 11:29.565
I'LL BE AFTER WANTING
THIS DONE IN 3 WEEKS.

11:29.565 --> 11:30.941
IT WILL BE DONE.

11:30.941 --> 11:34.153
SAYING'S ONE THING,
BUT DOING'S ANOTHER.

11:34.153 --> 11:35.321
YOU GOT MY WORD
ON IT.

11:35.321 --> 11:36.822
HA HA. WELL, IF
SOMETHING GOES WRONG,

11:36.822 --> 11:39.575
YOUR WORD IS NOT GOING TO
KEEP THE RAIN OUT OF MY SHED.

11:39.575 --> 11:42.828
I'M THINKING I'LL BE NEEDING
A BIT OF COLLATERAL.

11:42.828 --> 11:44.663
LIKE WHAT?

11:44.663 --> 11:48.250
I SEE YOU DRMNG
A FAIR YOKE OF OXEN.

11:48.250 --> 11:50.086
NOW, JUST KEEP IT
BUSINESSLIKE.

11:50.086 --> 11:53.172
YOU SIGN A CHATTEL MORTGAGE
LEAVING THE ANIMALS TO ME

11:53.172 --> 11:55.007
IN CASE YOU DON'T DO
THE WORK AS PROMISED.

11:55.007 --> 11:57.426
NOW, NO OFFENSE, INGALLS.
NO OFFENSE MEANT AT ALL.

11:57.426 --> 12:00.513
IT'S JUST THAT BEING BURNED
ONCE, YOU FEAR THE FIRE.

12:00.513 --> 12:06.727
I WAS A BELIEVING MAN ONCE UNTIL A
SHED SWORN TO BE SOUND FELL DOWN.

12:09.021 --> 12:11.524
I BUILD A ROOF
AND STACK THE GRAIN.

12:11.524 --> 12:16.362
IN 3 WEEKS.

12:16.362 --> 12:19.073
MY HAND ON IT.

12:19.073 --> 12:21.409
AND I HOPE YOU'LL BE
KEEPING YOUR PROMISE.

12:24.370 --> 12:26.414
THERE'S NOTHING
TO WORRY ABOUT.

12:26.414 --> 12:28.791
THE HOUSE IS ALL FINISHED
EXCEPT FOR A CUPBOARD

12:28.791 --> 12:29.917
AND A FEW SHELVES.

12:29.917 --> 12:31.502
THERE'S NO HURRY
ABOUT THOSE.

12:31.502 --> 12:33.295
ALL RIGHT, SO I WORK
AT O'NEIL'S FOR 6 HOURS.

12:33.295 --> 12:35.214
I WORK 6 HOURS AT HANSON'S.
THAT'S 12 HOURS.

12:35.214 --> 12:38.509
THAT GIVES ME PLENTY OF TIME FOR THE
PLOWING AND THE REST OF THE CHORES.

12:38.509 --> 12:40.553
WITH GOING AND COMING
AND EATING YOUR LUNCH,

12:40.553 --> 12:42.388
IT'S MORE LIKE
15 HOURS.

12:42.388 --> 12:44.723
WITH FARM WORK
ON TOP OF THAT,

12:44.723 --> 12:46.475
YOU WON'T
HAVE ANY TIME TO REST.

12:46.475 --> 12:47.977
IT'S ONLY
FOR 3 WEEKS.

12:47.977 --> 12:50.438
IT'S A LONG TIME
TO WALK IN YOUR SLEEP.

12:52.231 --> 12:54.442
I CAN DO IT.

12:55.985 --> 12:58.612
I BELIEVE YOU CAN.

13:17.006 --> 13:19.383
MARY, CUT UP CARRIE'S
HOT CAKES FOR HER, PLEASE.

13:19.383 --> 13:22.219
LAURA'S RIGHT THERE.
WHY CAN'T SHE DO IT?

13:22.219 --> 13:23.971
BECAUSE SHE'S GOING TO SET
A PLACE FOR HER FATHER.

13:23.971 --> 13:25.431
WHOA, WHOA, I HAVEN'T
GOT TIME TO EAT.

13:25.431 --> 13:26.599
I'M LATE FOR WORK
ALREADY.

13:26.599 --> 13:27.725
OH, CHARLES,
YOU HAVE TO EAT.

13:27.725 --> 13:29.852
I HAD SOME CORNBREAD
THIS MORNING.

13:29.852 --> 13:31.312
WAIT.

13:33.939 --> 13:35.524
YOU CAN EAT
THESE ON THE RUN.

13:35.524 --> 13:36.734
ALL RIGHT, FINE.

13:36.734 --> 13:38.777
SEE YOU TONIGHT!

13:41.030 --> 13:42.781
I WANT MOLASSES.

13:42.781 --> 13:46.285
YES, DEAR. YOUR FATHER
FORGOT HIS LUNCH.

13:46.285 --> 13:49.413
HERE, LAURA, RUN.
CATCH HIM!

13:49.413 --> 13:52.625
PA! PA! FORGOT
YOUR LUNCH!

13:52.625 --> 13:54.335
OH, THANK YOU,
DARLING.

13:54.335 --> 13:56.170
HAVE A NICE DAY.

14:18.275 --> 14:19.735
MORNING.

14:21.320 --> 14:23.197
OH. INGALLS.

14:23.197 --> 14:25.407
I'M DOC BAKER.

14:25.407 --> 14:28.077
WE HAVEN'T MET, BUT HANSON
POINTED YOU OUT TO ME.

14:28.077 --> 14:30.246
PLEASURE TO MEET YOU. GOT A
LITTLE RIM TROUBLE, HUH?

14:30.246 --> 14:33.332
THE WHOLE WHEEL'S
FALLEN APART.

14:33.332 --> 14:35.501
WELL, I CAN WEDGE IT
FOR YOU FOR NOW.

14:35.501 --> 14:37.628
YOU CAN?

14:37.628 --> 14:38.796
SURE.

32:45.923 --> 32:47.467
I GOT PLOWING TO DO, I
GOT WORK IN THE BARN.

32:47.467 --> 32:49.302
IT WILL HAVE TO WAIT.

32:50.887 --> 32:54.057
I'LL CHECK BACK IN A COUPLE
OF DAYS, MRS. INGALLS.

32:54.057 --> 32:56.517
THANK YOU, DOCTOR.
I'LL SEE YOU OUT.

32:59.228 --> 33:01.147
YOU STAY IN BED.

33:35.181 --> 33:37.767
YOU GIRLS DON'T LET
THE CORNBREAD BURN.

33:49.987 --> 33:51.656
YOU'RE LOOKING BETTER.

33:51.656 --> 33:54.117
I'M FEELING BETTER.

33:54.117 --> 33:56.536
THAT SOUP SMELLS GOOD.

34:02.500 --> 34:04.585
CAN I ASK YOU
A FAVOR?

34:04.585 --> 34:06.170
MMM-

34:06.170 --> 34:08.005
I DON'T WANT YOU TO GO OUT
AND DO ANY PLOWING ANYMORE.

34:08.005 --> 34:09.924
WE'VE ALREADY
TALKED THAT OUT.

34:09.924 --> 34:11.634
NO, I TALKED, BUT
YOU DIDN'T LISTEN.

34:11.634 --> 34:14.762
THE FIELD HAS TO BE HARROWED
BEFORE IT CAN BE PLANTED.

34:14.762 --> 34:17.390
NOW, GOD ISN'T
GOING TO DO IT.

34:17.390 --> 34:18.850
Laura:
CORNBREAD'S DONE, MA.

34:18.850 --> 34:21.894
COMING, DEAR.

34:21.894 --> 34:24.355
THAT ISN'T SACRILEGIOUS.
YOU SAID IT.

34:24.355 --> 34:29.110
IF GOD UNDERSTANDS FARMERS, HE
UNDERSTANDS FARMERS' WIVES.

35:05.772 --> 35:07.148
MRS. INGALLS.

35:07.148 --> 35:08.274
YES.

35:08.274 --> 35:09.734
I'M LIAM O'NEIL.

35:09.734 --> 35:13.362
YOUR HUSBAND CONTRACTED
TO DO SOME WORK FOR ME.

35:13.362 --> 35:15.031
YES, HOW ARE YOU?

35:15.031 --> 35:19.118
TROUBLED, MA'AM. YOUR HUSBAND
LEFT A SIGHT OF WORK UNDONE.

35:19.118 --> 35:22.038
HE WAS HURT. DR. BAKER
TOLD HIM TO STAY IN BED.

35:22.038 --> 35:24.665
YES, I AM SORRY THAT
I AM TO HEAR THAT,

35:24.665 --> 35:26.751
BUT THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH THE MATTER AT HAND.

35:26.751 --> 35:31.047
A CHATTEL MORTGAGE, MA'AM.
YOUR HUSBAND SIGNED IT,

35:31.047 --> 35:33.758
GUARANTEEING THAT THE WORK
WOULD BE DONE ON TIME

35:33.758 --> 35:37.220
OR THE YOKE OF OXEN
WOULD FORFEIT TO ME.

35:37.220 --> 35:40.431
WELL, THE WORK WASN'T DONE, AND
THAT'S THE PLAIN AND SIMPLE FACT.

35:40.431 --> 35:45.228
I KNOW, MR. O'NEIL, BUT MR.
HANSON WAS SUPPOSED TO TELL YOU

35:45.228 --> 35:46.479
MY HUSBAND WAS HURT.

35:46.479 --> 35:49.690
HURT HAS NOTHING TO
DO WITH THE MATTER.

35:49.690 --> 35:51.609
YOUR HUSBAND FAILED
TO DO AS HE PROMISED,

35:51.609 --> 35:54.153
AND NOW THE OXEN ARE MINE, SO
I'VE COME TO PICK THEM UP.

35:54.153 --> 35:57.740
PLEASE DON'T DO THIS.

35:57.740 --> 36:00.827
I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL.
TRULY I DO.

36:00.827 --> 36:04.956
BUT IF YOUR HUSBAND WAS IN MY POSITION,
HE'D DO EXACTLY THE SAME THING.

36:04.956 --> 36:07.250
I'M SORRY.

36:07.250 --> 36:09.168
SULLIVAN!

36:30.857 --> 36:33.693
DR. BAKER SAID YOU WEREN'T
TO GET OUT OF BED.

36:35.361 --> 36:37.280
HE SAID LOTS OF THINGS.

36:37.280 --> 36:42.159
PLEASE, JUST TELL ME WHAT O'NEIL SAID
WHEN HE SHOWED YOU THE MORTGAGE.

36:42.159 --> 36:45.204
HE SAID YOU HADN'T DONE THE WORK.
THE OXEN WERE HIS.

36:45.204 --> 36:46.914
NOW THERE WASN'T ANYTHING
I CAN DO ABOUT IT.

36:46.914 --> 36:48.499
THERE ISN'T ANYTHING
YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT.

36:48.499 --> 36:50.293
I NEVER SHOULD
HAVE SIGNED IT.

36:50.293 --> 36:52.378
BUT YOU DID SIGN IT,
AND YOU CAN'T FIGHT IT.

36:52.378 --> 36:54.672
NOW PLEASE GO BACK TO BED
BEFORE YOU HURT YOURSELF.

36:54.672 --> 36:56.883
NO, MR. O'NEIL AND I ARE
GOING TO HAVE ANOTHER TALK.

36:56.883 --> 36:58.509
- THIS ISN'T OVER.
- BUT IT IS!

36:58.509 --> 37:00.261
NO, IT ISN'T, 'CAUSE I'M
NOT GOING TO LET IT.

37:00.261 --> 37:02.930
WE LOSE THOSE OXEN,
I CAN'T MAKE A CROP.

37:02.930 --> 37:05.016
I CAN'T MAKE A CROP,
WE LOSE EVERYTHING.

37:05.016 --> 37:08.811
IT HAPPENED TO ME IN KANSAS.
IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN HERE.

37:22.742 --> 37:24.493
GO HOME, JACK.
GO HOME.

37:24.493 --> 37:26.412
GO HOME.

37:44.472 --> 37:46.599
[HAMMER POUNDING]

37:58.778 --> 38:01.364
DORFLER, IF IT'S
ALL RIGHT WITH YOU,

38:01.364 --> 38:04.200
I'LL GIVE YOU SOME CHICKENS IN
PAYMENT FOR THIS SHOEING JOB.

38:04.200 --> 38:06.911
I GOT MORE CHICKENS
NOW THAN I CAN USE.

38:06.911 --> 38:10.081
HALF MY CUSTOMERS BEEN
PAYING ME WITH CHICKENS.

38:10.081 --> 38:12.458
I NEVER THOUGHT OF THAT.

38:14.251 --> 38:16.504
WELL, LOOK WHO'S HERE.

38:19.757 --> 38:21.258
INGALLS.

38:21.258 --> 38:24.220
I THOUGHT YOU SAID HE WAS GOING
TO BE IN BED FOR A WHILE.

38:24.220 --> 38:26.973
THAT'S WHERE
HE SHOULD BE.

39:25.322 --> 39:30.828
WELL, INGALLS, YOU'RE
LOOKING POORLY, LAD.

39:30.828 --> 39:32.663
I DIDN'T COME HERE TO
TALK ABOUT MY HEALTH.

39:32.663 --> 39:34.832
'TWAS ONLY
A POLITENESS.

39:34.832 --> 39:36.667
I WANT TO SEE
THE MORTGAGE.

39:36.667 --> 39:38.878
YOU DID WHEN
YOU SIGNED IT, LAD.

39:38.878 --> 39:41.338
THEN I'LL SEE
IT AGAIN. NOW.

39:42.840 --> 39:47.511
AH, 'TIS THE DATE
YOU'RE WONDERING ABOUT.

39:47.511 --> 39:50.639
THE CONTRACT
EXPIRES TONIGHT.

39:53.684 --> 39:55.770
THEN THE OXEN
ARE STILL MINE.

39:55.770 --> 39:58.355
WELL, FOR A FEW WEE HOURS
MORE, TILL MIDNIGHT.

39:58.355 --> 40:00.900
I WAS OUT YOUR WAY
ON ANOTHER MATTER.

40:00.900 --> 40:03.736
I KNEW THAT YOU WOULDN'T BE
ABLE TO KEEP YOUR PROMISE HERE.

40:05.404 --> 40:07.448
SO YOU STOLE THE OXEN.

40:07.448 --> 40:11.202
WELL, NO, LAD, I WAS
JUST DOING YOU A FAVOR,

40:11.202 --> 40:13.079
SAVING YOU A TRIP
INTO TOWN.

40:13.079 --> 40:15.539
IF YOU WANT TO DO ME A FAVOR,
YOU'LL GIVE ME A COUPLE MORE DAYS.

40:15.539 --> 40:19.919
OH, SORRY AS I AM, BY THE LOOK OF YOU,
IT WOULD TAKE A LOT MORE THAN THAT.

40:19.919 --> 40:22.755
BESIDES, WHEN A BARGAIN IS
STRUCK AND A PAPER SIGNED,

40:22.755 --> 40:25.216
ALL PARTIES HAVE
TO ABIDE BY IT.

40:25.216 --> 40:30.012
WELL, I INTEND TO. I GOT TILL MIDNIGHT
TO KEEP MY END OF THE BARGAIN.

40:30.012 --> 40:34.058
I GOT A LOT OF STACKING
TO DO. I BEST GET AT IT.

40:45.236 --> 40:47.696
WONDER WHAT
HE'S UP TO.

40:50.407 --> 40:53.119
IT LOOKS LIKE HE'S
GOING BACK TO WORK.

40:53.119 --> 40:55.955
HMM.

43:14.301 --> 43:17.554
PA! PA!

43:20.474 --> 43:25.854
MARY...HALF-PINT,
I WANT YOU TO GO HOME.

43:27.731 --> 43:30.442
HEAR ME, I WANT YOU
TO GO HOME.

43:33.779 --> 43:36.532
COME ON. WE'LL DO IT.

45:18.509 --> 45:22.221
NOW, FELLERS, NOW,
THIS IS ALL A MISTAKE.

45:22.221 --> 45:27.142
LOOK, I NEVER MEANT
TO TAKE ADVANTAGE.

45:27.142 --> 45:30.437
UH, LOOK...

45:30.437 --> 45:34.983
IT WAS A BUSINESS DEAL. NOW, THAT'S
ALL IT WAS, WAS JUST BUSINESS.

45:34.983 --> 45:40.072
I--UH--WHEN I SAW THE POOR LAD
FALL DOWN AND HIM AND THAT SACK,

45:40.072 --> 45:43.367
AND THEN THE WEE ONES, THEY'RE
COMING TO HELP THEIR PA.

45:43.367 --> 45:46.787
LOOK, WELL, I SWEAR
ON MY MOTHER'S GRAVE,

45:46.787 --> 45:49.581
I WAS GOING TO GIVE
THE OXEN BACK.

46:31.623 --> 46:33.584
GO SLOWLY NOW, INGALLS.

46:33.584 --> 46:36.837
IT'S THE WAY
THE OXEN LIKE IT.

46:36.837 --> 46:38.005
MY THANKS
TO ALL OF YOU.

46:38.005 --> 46:42.092
OH, IT DID US GOOD
TO SWEAT A LITTLE.

46:42.092 --> 46:45.929
I JUST WISH THERE WAS SOME
WAY I COULD REPAY YOU.

46:45.929 --> 46:48.682
UH, JA, THERE
IS SOMETHING.

46:48.682 --> 46:52.936
UM, WE'VE BEEN THINKING OF HOLDING
A PLOWING AND HARROWING CONTEST

46:52.936 --> 46:54.521
AT THE CHURCH ON SUNDAY,

46:54.521 --> 46:58.734
AND IT WOULD BE A FAVOR TO US
IF WE COULD USE YOUR LAND.

47:06.742 --> 47:08.785
GOT A DEAL.

47:08.785 --> 47:10.329
DEAL.

47:11.955 --> 47:13.916
THANK YOU.

47:13.916 --> 47:15.918
COME ON,
LET'S GO HOME.

47:35.896 --> 47:37.439
UH-HUH.

47:37.439 --> 47:40.609
YOU'RE STILL
3 MINUTES EARLY.

48:14.476 --> 48:17.437
Laura: THAT WAS OUR
HAPPIEST HOMECOMING EVER.

48:17.437 --> 48:21.233
PA SAID HE WAS GLAD WE'D COME TO
LIVE ON THE BANKS OF PLUM CREEK,

48:21.233 --> 48:26.363
BECAUSE HERE HE'D HARVESTED A CROP
HE DIDN'T KNOW HE'D PLANTED--

48:26.363 --> 48:28.699
A HARVEST OF FRIENDS.
