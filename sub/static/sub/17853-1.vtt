00:01.385 --> 00:02.951
<i>Tonight, on the season premiere</i>

00:03.054 --> 00:04.820
of The Curse of Oak Island...

00:04.922 --> 00:06.721
Here comes the rig, Rick.

00:06.824 --> 00:09.792
<i>This summer I want to dig
in the Money Pit. It's time.</i>

00:09.860 --> 00:12.261
Out of the hole!

00:12.363 --> 00:14.363
<i> This Oak Island
map seems to indicate</i>

00:14.465 --> 00:18.000
<i>that someone came here in 1347.</i>

00:18.102 --> 00:19.535
On the face of the stone,

00:19.637 --> 00:21.437
you can see the cross
of the Knights Templar.

00:21.539 --> 00:23.072
<i>There's a strange map,</i>

00:23.174 --> 00:24.373
<i>there's a description
of a hatch.</i>

00:24.475 --> 00:26.041
<i>Might this be the trap door,</i>

00:26.143 --> 00:27.910
<i>a back way in?</i>

00:28.012 --> 00:29.545
-There it is.
-Holy smokes.

00:32.216 --> 00:35.050
<i> There is an island
in the North Atlantic</i>

00:35.152 --> 00:38.954
<i>where people have been looking
for an incredible treasure</i>

00:39.023 --> 00:41.657
<i>for more than 200 years.</i>

00:41.759 --> 00:45.294
<i>So far, they have found
bits of gold chain,</i>

00:45.396 --> 00:49.264
<i>a stone slab with strange
symbols carved into it...</i>

00:49.366 --> 00:52.468
<i>even a 17th century
Spanish coin.</i>

00:52.570 --> 00:54.937
<i>To date, six men have died</i>

00:55.039 --> 00:56.939
<i>trying to solve the mystery.</i>

00:58.109 --> 01:00.409
<i>And, according to legend,</i>

01:00.511 --> 01:02.911
<i>one more will have to die</i>

01:03.013 --> 01:06.348
<i>before the treasure
can be found.</i>

01:17.762 --> 01:19.728
<i>Okay, big brother.</i>

01:19.797 --> 01:23.465
<i>Here we are,
heading back to Oak Island.</i>

01:23.567 --> 01:26.068
Where are we
in the optimism chart?

01:26.170 --> 01:27.569
You need to ask?

01:27.671 --> 01:29.471
Yes, I'd like to know.

01:29.573 --> 01:31.874
-Eleven.
-Eleven. You're still an eleven?

01:31.976 --> 01:34.343
Yes because there's a
difference between

01:34.411 --> 01:36.411
belief and proof.

01:36.514 --> 01:38.547
Yeah, there sure is.

01:38.649 --> 01:41.250
-And, I believe.
-Okay.

01:41.318 --> 01:45.954
<i> In the ten years since
brothers Rick and Marty Lagina</i>

01:46.056 --> 01:48.257
<i>have been actively trying to
solve the Oak Island mystery...</i>

01:48.359 --> 01:50.092
Definitely got wood.

01:50.144 --> 01:52.077
<i> ...they have
experienced both success...</i>

01:52.179 --> 01:53.645
You think you're on the vault?

01:54.982 --> 01:56.582
<i>...and setbacks.</i>

01:57.818 --> 01:59.918
-Whoa.
-Whoa!

02:01.889 --> 02:02.955
It didn't work.

02:03.057 --> 02:05.057
Back to the drawing board.

02:05.159 --> 02:08.660
<i>But this year is different.</i>

02:08.762 --> 02:09.794
This is the year to come up
with something.

02:09.896 --> 02:11.363
We have to push the envelope.

02:11.465 --> 02:13.098
I'm with you, brother.

02:13.200 --> 02:14.666
<i>Because this is the year</i>

02:14.768 --> 02:19.004
<i>when they and their partners
have decided to invest</i>

02:19.106 --> 02:23.408
<i>more than $2 million in a
go-for-broke effort to find out</i>

02:23.511 --> 02:25.711
<i>if something of enormous value</i>

02:25.846 --> 02:29.781
<i>was buried here centuries ago.</i>

02:31.018 --> 02:33.752
<i>Hey, guys, we're back.</i>

02:33.854 --> 02:34.686
It's great to see you all.

02:34.788 --> 02:35.721
Marty and I talked about

02:35.823 --> 02:36.655
coming over here.

02:36.757 --> 02:37.890
He wants to get down to it.

02:37.992 --> 02:39.191
I think we all do.

02:39.293 --> 02:41.260
And to that end
we have to decide

02:41.362 --> 02:42.528
what we're gonna do this year.

02:42.630 --> 02:43.762
Time for action!

02:43.864 --> 02:45.531
I think it's time

02:45.633 --> 02:48.100
to dig in the Money Pit.
This year.

02:48.202 --> 02:50.202
- Who's on board with that?
- Yeah.

02:50.304 --> 02:52.104
I think we're all
on board with that.

02:52.206 --> 02:54.206
We're all on board with that.
Perfect, we have consensus.

02:54.308 --> 02:56.275
- Yeah.
- Last year,

02:56.377 --> 02:57.242
they...

02:57.344 --> 02:59.478
drilled a well,

02:59.580 --> 03:01.213
-went into a chamber...
-21 feet tall.

03:01.315 --> 03:02.814
And the intriguing part is

03:02.917 --> 03:04.783
they ran a camera in it.

03:04.885 --> 03:05.817
You can't argue with it,

03:05.920 --> 03:07.819
there's something gold-colored

03:07.922 --> 03:09.221
on the wall.

03:09.323 --> 03:11.023
<i>Last year,</i>

03:11.125 --> 03:13.926
<i>just before leaving
Oak Island for the season,</i>

03:14.028 --> 03:17.362
<i>Rick Lagina drilled
an exploratory borehole</i>

03:17.464 --> 03:21.233
<i>at a place where Oak Island's
historian, Charles Barkhouse,</i>

03:21.335 --> 03:23.969
<i>was convinced the team
could find the site</i>

03:24.071 --> 03:26.138
<i>of the original Money Pit.</i>

03:26.240 --> 03:28.407
<i>- After drilling down to a depth</i>

03:28.509 --> 03:30.676
<i>of 170 feet,</i>

03:30.778 --> 03:34.179
<i>they came upon
a 21-foot deep void.</i>

03:37.751 --> 03:41.386
<i> But even
more astonishing</i>

03:41.488 --> 03:43.255
<i>was what they saw after placing</i>

03:43.324 --> 03:46.024
<i>a pipe inspection camera
into the hole.</i>

03:46.126 --> 03:48.560
- What's that?
- It's a little shiny-like metal.

03:48.662 --> 03:49.828
Yeah, it looks,
it looks metallic.

03:49.930 --> 03:51.730
Look at how yellow that is.

03:51.832 --> 03:53.665
-It's your gold color, David.
-Yeah, there it is, David.

03:53.767 --> 03:55.467
Right there.

03:55.569 --> 03:58.036
What the hell is that?

03:58.138 --> 04:01.106
We don't know what it is,
but it's definitely there.

04:01.208 --> 04:02.507
Okay, the swamp,

04:02.610 --> 04:03.909
what do we want to do
in the swamp?

04:04.011 --> 04:05.777
Yeah, I mean
the key for the swamp is,

04:05.879 --> 04:08.714
you know,
can we find evidence that,

04:08.816 --> 04:12.751
either it was man-made or it was
drained back 300 years ago,

04:12.853 --> 04:14.252
some period of time?

04:14.355 --> 04:16.555
Look, now that we have
a deal with Fred Nolan,

04:16.656 --> 04:17.789
the-the key to that

04:17.891 --> 04:18.923
is that we can finally

04:19.026 --> 04:20.892
drain the swamp completely.

04:20.995 --> 04:25.130
When we do that, we can have
full access physically, on foot.

04:25.232 --> 04:27.466
And then perhaps,
once and for all,

04:27.568 --> 04:29.301
we can fully explore the area.

04:29.403 --> 04:31.303
-Good morning, Fred.
-Good morning.

04:31.405 --> 04:33.538
<i>Last year, and after a decade</i>

04:33.641 --> 04:36.642
<i>of tense negotiations,
Rick, Marty,</i>

04:36.744 --> 04:39.544
<i>and the Oak Island team
were finally able</i>

04:39.647 --> 04:41.346
<i>to reach an agreement
with fellow landowner</i>

04:41.448 --> 04:43.248
<i>and rival treasure hunter,</i>

04:43.350 --> 04:45.183
<i>Fred Nolan.</i>

04:45.285 --> 04:46.585
<i>It signaled a new era
of progress</i>

04:46.687 --> 04:48.954
<i>and mutual cooperation
on the island.</i>

04:49.056 --> 04:51.590
Welcome to the team.

04:51.692 --> 04:52.991
Well, I don't want to be
an obstacle anymore.

04:53.093 --> 04:54.960
I'm too old for that now.

04:56.797 --> 05:00.065
Okay, so, we're gonna get
sub-bottom profile data.

05:00.167 --> 05:02.200
-Yes. -Okay, so that's enough
with the swamp.

05:02.302 --> 05:03.702
Okay, so let's prioritize

05:03.804 --> 05:05.570
and to that end
we have to decide

05:05.673 --> 05:07.739
-how we're going to do it,
what we're going to do... -10-X!

05:10.310 --> 05:11.910
- Yup.
- 10-X, which I think

05:12.012 --> 05:14.046
is not dead, but at least
on life support.

05:16.450 --> 05:18.884
<i>While looking for a back door</i>

05:18.986 --> 05:22.888
<i>into the so-called Money Pit
in the early 1970s,</i>

05:22.990 --> 05:24.890
<i>Oak Island resident,
Dan Blankenship,</i>

05:24.992 --> 05:29.695
<i>drilled the 27-inch wide
borehole known as "10-X,"</i>

05:29.797 --> 05:33.665
<i>down to a depth of 235 feet.</i>

05:33.767 --> 05:35.100
<i>At the bottom,</i>

05:35.202 --> 05:38.403
<i>he saw what he believed
to be man-made objects,</i>

05:38.505 --> 05:43.308
<i>including what appeared
to be a wooden box.</i>

05:43.410 --> 05:47.679
<i>But when acclaimed deep-sea
diver, John Chatterton,</i>

05:47.781 --> 05:49.781
<i>explored 10-X last summer...</i>

05:52.820 --> 05:54.453
<i>...he reported the chamber</i>

05:54.555 --> 05:56.121
<i>was a natural formation.</i>

05:57.991 --> 05:59.357
Yeah, what-what is that, John?

06:00.561 --> 06:02.761
<i> And that
the so-called wooden box</i>

06:02.863 --> 06:04.262
<i>Dan claimed he had seen,</i>

06:04.364 --> 06:06.164
<i>was nothing more than a large,</i>

06:06.266 --> 06:08.133
<i>square-shaped rock.</i>

06:08.235 --> 06:10.802
Right about here,

06:10.904 --> 06:13.672
I had a rock that
I would estimate

06:13.774 --> 06:17.676
was ten inches to 12 inches,

06:17.745 --> 06:19.244
it was very angular,

06:19.346 --> 06:22.147
it had at least one
90-degree angle on it.

06:22.249 --> 06:25.283
I picked it up, I moved it,
it was, it was heavy.

06:25.385 --> 06:27.085
To me, that was

06:27.187 --> 06:30.355
what gave you
the sonar signal of the box.

06:34.194 --> 06:36.061
10-X specifically, I think,

06:36.163 --> 06:37.896
we're across the board--
some of us are over here,

06:37.998 --> 06:41.399
some of us are over here.
Where are you?

06:41.502 --> 06:43.969
I mean, Dad's seen
too much down there.

06:44.071 --> 06:46.071
And then Chatterton,
I actually think,

06:46.173 --> 06:47.773
you can't see.

06:47.875 --> 06:49.541
Yeah.

06:49.643 --> 06:51.409
No, I can't feel-I can't feel
a thing out there.

06:51.478 --> 06:52.944
There ain't all here.

06:53.046 --> 06:55.514
He didn't find
the square beam either.

06:55.616 --> 06:57.616
He didn't find the posts
and other stuff

06:57.751 --> 06:58.950
that were supposed to be there.

06:59.052 --> 07:00.919
So, you know,
maybe David's right.

07:01.021 --> 07:03.155
He wasn't able to fully
explore the cavity.

07:03.257 --> 07:05.323
I understand
what you're saying,

07:05.425 --> 07:07.592
but why isn't there something
more substantial there?

07:12.533 --> 07:14.800
-What's all this about?
-This came out of 10-X.

07:14.902 --> 07:16.234
That came out of 10-X.

07:16.336 --> 07:19.271
That came out of 10-X,
and that came out of 10-X.

07:19.373 --> 07:20.772
What more do you want, Marty?

07:20.874 --> 07:22.974
Chain, wire,

07:23.076 --> 07:25.277
and that low carbon steel.
It all tested out

07:25.379 --> 07:27.445
-as being made prior to 1750.
-We tested that, right?

07:27.548 --> 07:29.014
All of that

07:29.116 --> 07:31.349
-came from the bottom of the
damn hole. -All of those things?

07:31.451 --> 07:33.218
All of it came from
the bottom of the hole.

07:35.823 --> 07:37.956
<i> No one has ever
accused Dan Blankenship</i>

07:38.058 --> 07:40.225
<i>of being namby-pamby
about anything.</i>

07:40.327 --> 07:42.661
He has strong convictions,
he's a strong personality,

07:42.763 --> 07:45.630
<i>and he is totally
convinced that 10-X</i>

07:45.732 --> 07:49.034
<i>was dug into man-made features.</i>

07:49.136 --> 07:52.103
And Dan is like Rick,

07:52.206 --> 07:53.805
he does not want
to write off 10-X.

07:56.043 --> 07:57.843
Chatterton said he moved
the so-called box, right?

07:57.945 --> 07:59.978
Yeah.

08:00.080 --> 08:02.280
If it, in fact, has been moved

08:02.382 --> 08:03.815
then I think
he picked up the box

08:03.917 --> 08:06.318
and it was a rock.

08:06.420 --> 08:07.853
I want to get Brian back here,

08:07.955 --> 08:10.155
right, and rescan 10-X

08:10.257 --> 08:13.525
-All right. -because if that box
has been moved,

08:13.627 --> 08:15.627
then you know Chatterton
did what he said, he went over

08:15.729 --> 08:17.329
and picked it up and moved it.

08:17.431 --> 08:19.364
And I think it's explored then.

08:19.466 --> 08:20.498
That's what I say.

08:20.601 --> 08:21.900
So, we have an unknown,

08:22.002 --> 08:23.068
so let's do it.

08:23.170 --> 08:25.837
-Let's go scan it.
-Yeah.

08:25.939 --> 08:27.205
If that box is still there
I'm right with you guys.

08:27.307 --> 08:28.106
So let's find that out.

08:28.208 --> 08:29.808
Okay, fine.

08:29.910 --> 08:31.476
Okay, guys, this has been great.
Good discussion.

08:31.578 --> 08:33.211
We got a game plan
for the whole summer.

08:33.313 --> 08:35.447
-There's 10-X.
-Yeah.

08:35.549 --> 08:37.482
-The swamp.
-Yeah.

08:37.583 --> 08:39.284
And then there's the Money Pit,
which is our first step.

08:39.385 --> 08:41.686
-Yes.
-It's time to get stuff done.

08:41.788 --> 08:43.688
Let's go.

08:52.266 --> 08:53.798
Here comes the rig, Rick.

08:53.901 --> 08:55.166
Yeah, let's go,
let's get in the vehicle

08:55.269 --> 08:57.035
and lead them up.

08:57.137 --> 09:00.839
<i> For now, Rick, Marty
and the team</i>

09:00.941 --> 09:02.274
<i>have resolved
their differing opinions</i>

09:02.376 --> 09:05.210
<i>concerning the fate of 10-X.</i>

09:05.312 --> 09:06.845
<i>They are firmly united</i>

09:06.947 --> 09:09.581
<i>when it comes to this year's
primary target...</i>

09:09.683 --> 09:11.883
I'm gonna move the backhoe,
Rick.

09:11.985 --> 09:15.086
<i>...the Oak Island Money Pit.</i>

09:15.155 --> 09:17.122
Let's bring it over to this one.

09:17.224 --> 09:18.556
<i>But a large excavation</i>

09:18.659 --> 09:21.192
<i>of the Money Pit
will not be easy.</i>

09:21.295 --> 09:23.094
Just like old times.

09:23.196 --> 09:24.262
Yup, that's right.

09:24.364 --> 09:25.830
Follow this track right here,

09:25.933 --> 09:26.731
and back right in there.

09:28.235 --> 09:29.935
<i>When the last such attempt</i>

09:30.037 --> 09:31.002
<i>was made in 1965...</i>

09:31.104 --> 09:33.104
Come back.

09:33.173 --> 09:34.673
<i>...the hole that was dug</i>

09:34.775 --> 09:35.874
<i>was plagued
by constant flooding</i>

09:35.976 --> 09:37.342
<i>and cave-ins.</i>

09:40.747 --> 09:42.280
Let's grab that back hammer.

09:42.382 --> 09:45.083
<i>Before the team can begin
their excavation</i>

09:45.185 --> 09:46.484
<i>of the Money Pit,</i>

09:46.586 --> 09:49.854
<i>they must first remove
old drill casings</i>

09:49.957 --> 09:51.489
<i>that had been left
in the ground</i>

09:51.558 --> 09:53.792
<i>during their
previous explorations.</i>

09:57.197 --> 09:59.164
<i> I mean, it's a really
simple method.</i>

09:59.266 --> 10:01.333
<i>What they're doing is,
they blow a hole in the pipe.</i>

10:01.435 --> 10:04.903
<i>They stick a rod in there.</i>

10:05.005 --> 10:08.940
Then this hammer which pounds
upward hooks onto that pin,

10:09.042 --> 10:12.344
and then they just put
compressed air on the hammer.

10:12.446 --> 10:15.347
It pounds up, literally,
pounding the casing up.

10:15.449 --> 10:16.848
<i>Once it loosens,</i>

10:16.950 --> 10:20.552
<i>he thinks that they'll
be able to-to pull it up</i>

10:20.654 --> 10:23.521
<i>with just the pressure off the
rig, but to get it started,</i>

10:23.623 --> 10:25.790
<i>they need that hammer.</i>

10:25.892 --> 10:27.425
We'll surely have an idea
of whether or not

10:27.527 --> 10:28.960
- this is gonna work.
- No, yeah,

10:29.062 --> 10:30.362
he'll be on to one
by the end of the day,

10:30.464 --> 10:32.130
- I would hope.
- Just one?

10:32.232 --> 10:33.765
Well, it depends, Jack.

10:33.867 --> 10:35.066
He may hook onto that one,
and slick,

10:35.168 --> 10:37.035
it'll come out just like snot,

10:37.137 --> 10:38.636
and then he may spend all day

10:38.739 --> 10:40.505
beating on
the thing, and...

10:40.607 --> 10:41.606
And it hardly moves.

10:41.708 --> 10:42.707
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

10:42.776 --> 10:44.109
It all depends on

10:44.211 --> 10:46.277
how Mother Nature
wants to grab it.

10:47.748 --> 10:48.680
All right, well,

10:48.782 --> 10:50.215
let's get the real fun going.

10:50.317 --> 10:51.249
There we go.

10:53.186 --> 10:55.153
Walk that baby up!

11:11.004 --> 11:12.337
That ain't coming too good.

11:12.439 --> 11:14.072
That ain't coming at all.

11:18.678 --> 11:20.111
On the hand-drawn map,

11:20.213 --> 11:21.679
there's something
called the hatch.

11:21.782 --> 11:24.249
Rick! Don't you want to go
dig up the hatch?

11:24.351 --> 11:25.550
Right about here

11:25.652 --> 11:27.085
<i>is our search area.</i>

11:27.187 --> 11:29.087
Wow. I think this is it.

11:36.522 --> 11:39.022
<i> The Oak Island team's
efforts to begin</i>

11:39.124 --> 11:41.725
<i>clearing obstructions
from the Money Pit</i>

11:41.827 --> 11:44.761
<i>have just experienced
a serious setback.</i>

11:44.863 --> 11:48.065
<i>One of the old drill casings
refuses to budge.</i>

11:53.872 --> 11:58.475
<i>If driller Arthur Jefferson
can't remove the steel casing</i>

11:58.577 --> 12:01.545
<i>from what is known as
the Valley Three borehole,</i>

12:01.647 --> 12:03.947
<i>Rick, Marty,
and their partners</i>

12:04.049 --> 12:06.650
<i>may not be able
to dig in that area--</i>

12:06.752 --> 12:08.552
<i>the same area where,</i>

12:08.654 --> 12:10.187
<i>two years ago,
they found evidence</i>

12:10.255 --> 12:13.890
<i>of what could be
a large, wooden vault</i>

12:13.993 --> 12:17.995
<i>buried some 143 feet deep
underground.</i>

12:18.097 --> 12:20.831
That's what they found
in the top of the vault.

12:24.803 --> 12:26.670
We could use a little luck,

12:26.772 --> 12:27.838
don't you think?

12:27.940 --> 12:29.139
Yeah.

12:37.650 --> 12:39.316
<i>If the casing shears off,</i>

12:39.418 --> 12:40.851
<i>we're in trouble, because</i>

12:40.953 --> 12:43.286
<i>it's extremely difficult
to deal with</i>

12:43.389 --> 12:44.988
<i>large steel underground,</i>

12:45.090 --> 12:47.090
and if we move,
we miss the target.

12:51.230 --> 12:53.597
<i> Finally, the steel
casing begins to move.</i>

13:07.312 --> 13:09.046
<i>The old casings are coming out.</i>

13:09.148 --> 13:10.847
They're coming out intact.

13:10.949 --> 13:12.849
We're not leaving any pieces
in the ground so far.

13:12.918 --> 13:15.485
<i>It's working.
We're encouraged.</i>

13:15.587 --> 13:17.354
-Okay, well...
-Let's go.

13:25.531 --> 13:27.931
<i> With the task
of clearing obstructions</i>

13:28.033 --> 13:29.399
<i>from the Money Pit completed,</i>

13:29.501 --> 13:32.903
<i>Rick Lagina and members
of the Oak Island team</i>

13:33.005 --> 13:34.838
<i>gather in the war room.</i>

13:34.940 --> 13:38.341
- Hey, guys. -Hey.
- Hey, Rick.

13:38.444 --> 13:39.843
<i>They are joined by researcher</i>

13:39.945 --> 13:42.713
<i>and area historian
Doug Crowell.</i>

13:42.815 --> 13:45.148
<i>And attending
via videoconference</i>

13:45.250 --> 13:46.550
<i>are Rick's brother Marty</i>

13:46.652 --> 13:48.118
<i>and their partner,
Craig Tester,</i>

13:48.220 --> 13:51.221
<i>from their offices
in Traverse City, Michigan.</i>

13:51.323 --> 13:56.226
Today, we have something
that I think will astound you,

13:56.328 --> 14:00.030
and what little I know,
it's remarkable.

14:00.099 --> 14:01.631
All right, I'm with you.

14:01.734 --> 14:03.500
To that end,
I'll let Doug take over.

14:03.602 --> 14:04.634
Gentlemen, hi.

14:04.737 --> 14:05.936
- How are you?
- Hi, Doug.

14:06.038 --> 14:07.571
A couple of months ago,

14:07.673 --> 14:09.773
I got introduced
to this lady in New York

14:09.875 --> 14:12.509
who's been pursuing
some Templar research

14:12.611 --> 14:14.544
for the last seven
or eight years.

14:14.646 --> 14:15.712
And she's actually followed

14:15.814 --> 14:18.115
the Templars
out of the Holy Land

14:18.217 --> 14:21.084
and to the New World
in her research.

14:22.921 --> 14:24.321
<i> Among the many
persistent theories</i>

14:24.423 --> 14:27.090
<i>about Oak Island is that</i>

14:27.192 --> 14:28.592
<i>as far back
as the 14th century,</i>

14:28.694 --> 14:30.527
<i>members of
the Knights Templar--</i>

14:30.629 --> 14:33.730
<i>while escaping
from persecution in Europe--</i>

14:33.799 --> 14:36.566
<i>sailed across
the North Atlantic</i>

14:36.668 --> 14:39.603
<i>and buried an incredible
sacred treasure on the island</i>

14:39.705 --> 14:42.205
<i>in order to keep it from harm.</i>

14:42.307 --> 14:45.208
<i>Although much
circumstantial evidence exists,</i>

14:45.310 --> 14:47.144
<i>no one has yet
been able to prove</i>

14:47.246 --> 14:50.847
<i>that the Templars
were ever in Nova Scotia,</i>

14:50.949 --> 14:54.117
<i>let alone
buried treasure there.</i>

14:54.219 --> 14:57.320
Who is this mysterious woman?

14:57.422 --> 14:59.623
The lady's name is Zena Halpern.

14:59.725 --> 15:01.558
Perhaps what we should do is
introduce you to Zena herself.

15:01.660 --> 15:03.293
Maybe we can get her in

15:03.395 --> 15:06.263
-on a conference call.
-I'm all ears.

15:06.365 --> 15:08.732
<i> Zena Halpern
is a New York-based</i>

15:08.834 --> 15:10.233
<i>author and researcher</i>

15:10.335 --> 15:12.302
<i>- who is currently investigating</i>

15:12.404 --> 15:14.171
<i>what she believes is evidence</i>

15:14.273 --> 15:17.607
<i>of Knights Templar activity
in North America.</i>

15:17.709 --> 15:19.409
- Hello?
- Hi, Zena.

15:19.511 --> 15:21.344
- It's Doug.
- Hi.

15:21.446 --> 15:22.913
So, I'm with the folks
on Oak Island.

15:24.516 --> 15:26.750
And I just gave everyone here
a little overview

15:26.852 --> 15:28.819
on what your research involves,

15:28.921 --> 15:32.422
and that you have some
pretty interesting documents.

15:32.491 --> 15:35.659
We have a map
that shows Nova Scotia...

15:35.761 --> 15:39.095
we have a map of Oak Island...

15:39.198 --> 15:40.864
and then we have the cipher.

16:11.196 --> 16:13.230
One of her research assistants

16:13.332 --> 16:15.365
knew of the work I was doing

16:15.467 --> 16:17.200
pursuing the history
of the 90-foot stone

16:17.269 --> 16:20.170
and so they thought
I should see this cipher.

16:20.272 --> 16:21.738
And I was immediately intrigued,

16:21.840 --> 16:24.474
<i>because this appears
to be using</i>

16:24.576 --> 16:26.076
<i>the very same symbols</i>

16:26.178 --> 16:28.545
<i>that the cipher
for the 90-foot stone uses.</i>

16:30.349 --> 16:32.215
Do you want to tell the guys

16:32.317 --> 16:34.317
how this cipher
came into your possession?

16:45.564 --> 16:48.298
<i>Two maps and a cipher</i>

16:48.400 --> 16:52.636
<i>that supposedly prove a Templar
journey to the New World?</i>

16:52.738 --> 16:56.072
<i>But if such a journey happened,</i>

16:56.174 --> 16:58.308
<i>could additional evidence exist</i>

16:58.410 --> 17:00.076
<i>that they brought treasure
to Oak Island,</i>

17:00.178 --> 17:02.012
<i>possibly sacred artifacts</i>

17:02.114 --> 17:05.648
<i>rescued from the Holy Land
during the Crusades?</i>

17:05.751 --> 17:08.285
I've never seen another cipher

17:08.387 --> 17:10.053
that uses the same symbols.

17:10.155 --> 17:13.522
I mean, when you look there,
you see more symbols

17:13.625 --> 17:16.126
than what was used in
the 90-foot stone cipher,

17:16.228 --> 17:18.361
but there's way more
to this cipher, as well.

17:18.463 --> 17:20.763
The whole cipher
doesn't seem to be here,

17:20.866 --> 17:22.232
it runs off the page.

17:22.334 --> 17:24.634
This seems to be a fragment
of a larger cipher,

17:24.736 --> 17:27.837
-and I've been trying
to decipher. -Okay.

17:27.940 --> 17:30.106
I started running it through
the deciphering program

17:30.208 --> 17:32.275
that I have and running it
through various languages

17:32.377 --> 17:34.511
and I started to get some hits
in Portuguese.

17:35.714 --> 17:37.280
Each symbol is a character,

17:37.382 --> 17:38.648
- each a-a letter?
- Right.

17:38.750 --> 17:41.785
The words I've pulled
out of it so far

17:41.887 --> 17:43.920
are "greyware," which is
a term for pottery,

17:44.022 --> 17:46.022
"gold,"

17:46.124 --> 17:47.824
"Cephala"--

17:47.926 --> 17:51.628
the site of the first
Portuguese fort and factory

17:51.730 --> 17:54.664
on the east coast
of Africa in 1505--

17:54.766 --> 17:58.368
and "Joab," a general
in King David's army

17:58.470 --> 18:00.670
who spent a lot of time
in northern Africa.

18:02.607 --> 18:04.607
Sure.

18:06.912 --> 18:09.112
Right. In one of
the stories I was reading,

18:09.214 --> 18:12.382
it was mentioned that Joab was
pushing the Philistines back

18:12.484 --> 18:15.585
and he made it safe for
the transport of the ark.

18:16.621 --> 18:17.854
<i>The ark?</i>

18:17.956 --> 18:20.690
<i>Could the cipher
Zena Halpern found</i>

18:20.792 --> 18:23.593
<i>be referring to
the ark of the covenant,</i>

18:23.695 --> 18:26.763
<i>the sacred golden chest
built by the Israelites</i>

18:26.865 --> 18:29.532
<i>to house the Ten Commandments?</i>

18:29.634 --> 18:32.202
<i>According to the Bible,</i>

18:32.304 --> 18:34.404
<i>Joab was a commander
in King David's army</i>

18:34.506 --> 18:38.942
<i>charged with protecting the
king's most precious objects.</i>

18:39.044 --> 18:42.779
<i>Is it possible the so-called
La Formule cipher</i>

18:42.881 --> 18:46.116
<i>actually holds a coded message
connecting the fate</i>

18:46.218 --> 18:50.720
<i>of the ark of the covenant
to the Oak Island mystery?</i>

18:52.024 --> 18:54.290
And when I look at this,
I say, okay,

18:54.359 --> 18:57.193
we've got the same symbols
in two different ciphers,

18:57.295 --> 18:59.062
one that seems
to pertain to Africa

18:59.164 --> 19:00.764
and then one that pertain

19:00.866 --> 19:02.866
to a message on a stone
here on Oak Island.

19:02.968 --> 19:07.504
Does this suggest that there's
an organization out there

19:07.606 --> 19:09.839
that was using these symbols
to encode messages?

19:09.941 --> 19:12.709
That were doing
something in Africa

19:12.811 --> 19:16.913
and somehow, also,
were here on Oak Island?

19:19.751 --> 19:22.052
A friend of mine
bought this property

19:22.154 --> 19:25.555
<i>that was built
by the Knights Templar.</i>

19:25.657 --> 19:27.090
On the face of the stone,

19:27.192 --> 19:29.092
you can see the cross
of the Knights Templar.

19:44.401 --> 19:45.733
<i>In the war room,</i>

19:45.802 --> 19:47.301
<i>Rick, Marty, and their partners</i>

19:47.404 --> 19:49.170
<i>are meeting with area historian</i>

19:49.272 --> 19:50.738
<i>Doug Crowell.</i>

19:50.840 --> 19:52.373
<i>Joining them on the phone</i>

19:52.475 --> 19:55.343
<i>is Knights Templar researcher
Zena Halpern,</i>

19:55.445 --> 19:57.412
<i>who has just shared with them</i>

19:57.480 --> 19:59.614
<i>her recent discovery
of two maps and a cipher,</i>

19:59.716 --> 20:01.482
<i>which she believes</i>

20:01.584 --> 20:04.152
<i>could help solve
the Oak Island mystery.</i>

20:09.125 --> 20:11.325
The map that's dated in
the upper right-hand corner

20:11.428 --> 20:14.028
seems to be dated 1179.

20:32.749 --> 20:34.415
The Rhodon part...

20:34.517 --> 20:36.584
to me, it suggests New Ross.

20:36.686 --> 20:38.920
And I think most people here
are familiar with

20:39.022 --> 20:40.788
the idea that Henry Sinclair

20:40.890 --> 20:42.790
came over to Nova Scotia in 1398

20:42.892 --> 20:46.661
and perhaps settled
in the New Ross area.

20:46.763 --> 20:49.730
<i> The town of New Ross
in Nova Scotia</i>

20:49.833 --> 20:52.533
<i>is believed by some
to have been the location</i>

20:52.635 --> 20:56.471
<i>of an ancient Templar fortress
built in the late 1300s</i>

20:56.539 --> 20:59.107
<i>by Scottish Templar Knight
Prince Henry Sinclair</i>

20:59.209 --> 21:02.643
<i>after his journey
to Oak Island.</i>

21:02.745 --> 21:05.780
<i>But could it be that
Sinclair's reported journey</i>

21:05.882 --> 21:09.383
<i>occurred more than 200 years
after the first Templars</i>

21:09.486 --> 21:11.052
<i>visited the area?</i>

21:11.154 --> 21:14.322
<i>And if so,
might there be a connection</i>

21:14.424 --> 21:18.593
<i>between New Ross and Templar
activity on Oak Island?</i>

21:18.695 --> 21:21.329
So we have your map
that shows Nova Scotia,

21:21.431 --> 21:25.399
and we have a map that seems to
be a French map of Oak Island.

21:25.502 --> 21:28.102
This Oak Island map
that you're showing us,

21:28.204 --> 21:31.772
it seems to indicate that
that someone came here

21:31.875 --> 21:33.841
in 1347.

21:53.796 --> 21:56.230
<i> The hand-drawn map
is clearly Oak Island.</i>

21:56.332 --> 21:58.633
And then there are
several things named in French,

21:58.735 --> 22:01.068
which have been
translated for us.

22:01.171 --> 22:03.838
<i>One is called "the basin,"
translated from French.</i>

22:03.940 --> 22:06.207
<i>Well, that clearly
correlates to the swamp</i>

22:06.309 --> 22:09.710
<i>on the Nolan side
of the island.</i>

22:09.812 --> 22:12.013
<i>Also delineated is
something called "the marsh,"</i>

22:12.115 --> 22:14.048
<i>and that would be
the swamp proper.</i>

22:14.150 --> 22:17.552
And there is the reference
to what's called "the dam."

22:17.654 --> 22:19.854
<i>And it points to where
Fred Nolan</i>

22:19.956 --> 22:23.791
<i>articulated to us last year
that there was a log wall.</i>

22:23.893 --> 22:25.860
And then there's something
on the map called

22:25.962 --> 22:27.662
"the oak enter here,"

22:27.764 --> 22:32.033
<i>which points right about
to where the Money Pit is.</i>

22:32.135 --> 22:33.668
And then we have
two or three things

22:33.770 --> 22:35.436
that we don't know
anything about.

22:35.538 --> 22:38.839
<i>One's called "the anchors,"
one's called "the valve,"</i>

22:38.942 --> 22:41.609
<i>and one's called
"the hatch."</i>

22:43.680 --> 22:46.214
Where it says "the hatch,"
in the McGinnis family,

22:46.316 --> 22:48.216
there seems to be
some stories that...

22:48.318 --> 22:50.017
-About this hatch.
-Yeah.

22:50.119 --> 22:53.688
One of the uncles, he said,
basically, there's a hatch

22:53.790 --> 22:55.523
that you only have to
sink a spade to find,

22:55.625 --> 22:59.093
and that, once you do,
don't get lost down there.

23:01.664 --> 23:03.264
-Rick.
-What?

23:03.366 --> 23:05.466
I think we should try
and find out

23:05.568 --> 23:08.236
some way of verifying
these documents.

23:08.338 --> 23:11.239
I mean, Rick, don't you want
to go dig up the hatch?

23:11.341 --> 23:12.506
No question about it.

23:12.609 --> 23:14.508
<i>Looking at these maps,</i>

23:14.611 --> 23:17.411
you have a series of things
that correlate perfectly

23:17.513 --> 23:18.980
with the island
as we know it,

23:19.115 --> 23:21.082
and then you have things
that we've never heard of.

23:21.184 --> 23:24.151
So, of course, we want
to search for them.

23:24.254 --> 23:27.955
The story of this,
I-I believe is

23:28.057 --> 23:30.424
multi-layered
and very complex,

23:30.526 --> 23:32.360
so I want to continue
down this road.

23:32.462 --> 23:34.462
But there's a lot more work
to be done on it.

23:34.564 --> 23:35.997
Yeah.

23:36.099 --> 23:38.099
<i> You know, I'm not sure
that Zena's research</i>

23:38.201 --> 23:39.967
<i>is gonna lead to answers,</i>

23:40.069 --> 23:43.971
but this whole place
is all about rumor,

23:44.073 --> 23:47.608
conjecture, supposition,
hope, belief.

23:47.710 --> 23:51.445
<i>And so she has a theory,
which, uniquely,</i>

23:51.547 --> 23:54.015
<i>is backed up
by documentation.</i>

23:54.117 --> 23:56.651
And I surely would regret not
following up on this research.

23:56.753 --> 23:59.553
Zena, we want to
thank you for talking with us.

23:59.656 --> 24:01.155
-Thank you, Zena.
-Thank you, Zena.

24:01.257 --> 24:02.423
Bye-bye.
- Bye.

24:02.525 --> 24:03.858
<i> Thanks.
It was very interesting.</i>

24:03.960 --> 24:05.726
<i>- Doug, thank you very much.
- Yup.</i>

24:12.702 --> 24:15.102
<i> One day after
the team's incredible</i>

24:15.204 --> 24:16.937
<i>conference call
with Oak Island researcher</i>

24:17.040 --> 24:19.040
<i>Zena Halpern,</i>

24:19.142 --> 24:21.542
<i>Rick Lagina, Charles Barkhouse,</i>

24:21.644 --> 24:23.377
<i>and researcher
Doug Crowell</i>

24:23.479 --> 24:26.647
<i>travel to the small town
of New Ross, Nova Scotia,</i>

24:26.749 --> 24:30.151
<i>approximately 20 miles north
of Oak Island.</i>

24:30.253 --> 24:32.987
Alessandra Nadudvari,
she's a fellow researcher

24:33.089 --> 24:34.922
and a friend of mine--
she and her husband have

24:35.024 --> 24:36.223
bought this property now

24:36.326 --> 24:39.327
that was purported to be
the site of a castle.

24:40.763 --> 24:42.663
Perhaps built by
the Knights Templar.

24:44.567 --> 24:48.002
If that connection
can be drawn--

24:48.104 --> 24:50.237
you couldn't ask
for more than that.

24:50.340 --> 24:52.807
Here we are, guys.
Right here on the left.

24:52.909 --> 24:53.774
-Right here?
-Yes.

24:55.645 --> 24:57.311
Okay.

24:57.413 --> 24:59.380
New Ross castle.

24:59.482 --> 25:01.849
And there's Tim
and Alessandra right there.

25:01.951 --> 25:03.818
-Hey, Rick.
-Hello.

25:03.920 --> 25:07.288
Gentlemen, I want to introduce
you to Alessandra Nandudvari.

25:07.390 --> 25:10.091
<i> Researcher and author
Alessandra Nadudvari,</i>

25:10.193 --> 25:12.493
<i>and her husband,
Tim Loncarich,</i>

25:12.595 --> 25:16.297
<i>recently purchased
this property in 2016.</i>

25:16.399 --> 25:18.432
And if you'd like,
I'll show you what we've got.

25:18.534 --> 25:20.368
-Absolutely.
-Lead on.

25:20.470 --> 25:22.136
<i> They believe
it was occupied</i>

25:22.238 --> 25:25.706
<i>centuries ago by members
of the Knights Templar</i>

25:25.808 --> 25:27.708
<i>for the purpose of
hiding something</i>

25:27.810 --> 25:30.144
<i>of either great
historic importance</i>

25:30.246 --> 25:32.613
<i>or incredible value.</i>

25:34.450 --> 25:36.183
Well, welcome
to our backyard.

25:36.285 --> 25:39.887
In the 1970s,
one of the previous owners was

25:39.989 --> 25:42.123
digging in the backyard here
for a garden,

25:42.225 --> 25:45.359
and she started to uncover
what she thought were

25:45.461 --> 25:47.228
foundation stones
of an ancient castle.

25:51.467 --> 25:53.100
<i>When author Joan Harris</i>

25:53.202 --> 25:56.704
<i>purchased the property
in 1972,</i>

25:56.806 --> 25:58.539
<i>the only sign
of prior habitation</i>

25:58.608 --> 26:00.441
<i>was an old well,</i>

26:00.543 --> 26:03.611
<i>intricately constructed
of small boulders.</i>

26:03.713 --> 26:06.180
<i>Over the years,
she uncovered the remains</i>

26:06.282 --> 26:09.817
<i>of an entire foundation.</i>

26:09.886 --> 26:12.420
This is one of the stones
that she uncovered.

26:12.522 --> 26:14.121
She called it
the Herm Stone,

26:14.223 --> 26:18.159
and she felt that
it could be a grave marker.

26:18.261 --> 26:20.394
And if you look
more closely on the face,

26:20.496 --> 26:23.597
it looks like there could be
something carved on the face.

26:23.699 --> 26:25.499
It's very worn,
as it would be

26:25.601 --> 26:27.735
if it was 700
or 800 years old.

26:29.405 --> 26:31.439
I think that,
on the face of the stone,

26:31.541 --> 26:34.008
you can see a very faint
outline of a cross.

26:34.110 --> 26:37.111
It's a... in my opinion,
what it looks like,

26:37.213 --> 26:39.914
it's a Christian cross,
and no ordinary cross,

26:40.016 --> 26:42.683
but the cross
of the Knights Templar.

26:46.122 --> 26:47.988
This is the holy well.

26:48.090 --> 26:49.523
Let's get a good look
at the bottom.

26:52.228 --> 26:55.196
Does that look like
a flagstone floor?

27:01.437 --> 27:04.505
It does resemble a cross,
and to me looks like

27:04.607 --> 27:06.140
the cross
of the Knights Templar.

27:06.242 --> 27:07.741
Specifically,
Portuguese Templars.

27:09.812 --> 27:12.580
I would love for there to be
a Templar connection.

27:12.682 --> 27:16.484
I find that...
that niche in history--

27:16.586 --> 27:18.786
the Templar years,
if you want to call them that--

27:18.888 --> 27:20.454
incredibly intriguing.

27:20.556 --> 27:23.524
What makes it Portuguese
Templar, if I can ask?

27:23.626 --> 27:24.558
The shape of it.

27:24.660 --> 27:25.726
I've seen pictures

27:25.828 --> 27:27.461
of Portuguese
Templar crosses

27:27.563 --> 27:29.396
on documents
from the 1100s,

27:29.499 --> 27:31.799
and it's exactly
this shape.

27:31.901 --> 27:35.069
It has that beautiful
rounded shape.

27:35.171 --> 27:37.872
And it's oftentimes portrayed
inside a circle.

27:39.942 --> 27:41.308
That's funny, I can see
the impression of that.

27:41.410 --> 27:43.644
-Yeah, I can.
-Yeah.

27:43.779 --> 27:46.280
<i> Could Rick Lagina
and the others</i>

27:46.382 --> 27:50.117
<i>really be looking
at a Portuguese Templar Cross?</i>

27:53.122 --> 27:55.389
I mean, to me,
this cut line here

27:55.491 --> 27:57.358
is very distinctive.

27:57.460 --> 28:00.160
What draws my attention, really,
is what we're not seeing.

28:00.263 --> 28:03.163
If that is there,
then what could be below?

28:03.266 --> 28:07.268
This-- There's a line... there's
almost a cut mark here

28:07.370 --> 28:08.402
that's very intriguing.

28:08.504 --> 28:10.104
-Yes.
-Yeah.

28:10.206 --> 28:12.139
Do you know how large
the stone is?

28:12.241 --> 28:14.475
And have you looked at the base
of the stone for any carvings?

28:14.577 --> 28:17.611
Not yet. We haven't done
any excavation.

28:17.713 --> 28:19.647
That's one of the next
steps for us

28:19.749 --> 28:22.449
is to lift the stone
and see what's under it.

28:22.552 --> 28:24.752
-You've got to be a bit...
-Curious.

28:24.854 --> 28:26.253
-More than a bit curious.
-Yeah. Right.

28:26.355 --> 28:28.422
I mean, if you have
a Templar cross,

28:28.524 --> 28:30.724
you know, you have to wonder
what's down below.

28:30.826 --> 28:32.226
Right. Exactly.

28:32.328 --> 28:35.930
Under the soil here,
there are walls--

28:36.032 --> 28:39.633
ancient foundation walls
up to five feet thick

28:39.735 --> 28:41.835
that cover this area.

28:41.938 --> 28:46.640
And the apex of that structure
is the well over there.

28:46.742 --> 28:48.943
Let's take a look
at the well.

28:50.179 --> 28:53.180
This is what
for a long time has been called

28:53.282 --> 28:54.882
the holy well.

28:54.984 --> 28:56.650
This water,
for some reason,

28:56.752 --> 29:00.854
is supposed to have
curative powers.

29:00.923 --> 29:03.223
We've been told that the walls
are about four feet thick.

29:03.326 --> 29:06.594
And there are stories that
there are also chambers

29:06.696 --> 29:09.830
leading off of the well.

29:09.932 --> 29:11.632
But we don't know
for sure.

29:11.734 --> 29:13.233
Well, we might be able
to help you with that today

29:13.336 --> 29:14.568
because I brought
some equipment with me.

29:14.670 --> 29:15.603
We could drop a camera
down in the well.

29:15.705 --> 29:17.071
That would be great.

29:17.173 --> 29:18.572
<i>There's always been
this connection</i>

29:18.674 --> 29:20.507
with Oak Island
and New Ross.

29:20.610 --> 29:22.643
And thus, you know,
maybe we might be able

29:22.745 --> 29:24.345
to puzzle that connection out.

29:24.447 --> 29:25.846
<i>I don't know what
we're gonna find,</i>

29:25.948 --> 29:27.414
<i>but we may
learn something today.</i>

29:27.516 --> 29:30.117
Okay, folks, I think
we're geared up here.

29:30.219 --> 29:31.018
Rick, I'm gonna give you
the monitor.

29:31.120 --> 29:32.386
Okay.

29:32.488 --> 29:34.221
Charles, if you'd manage
the cables for me.

29:34.290 --> 29:35.823
I will. Yes.

29:37.426 --> 29:39.760
Okay...

29:39.862 --> 29:42.262
-You get a picture there?
-Yep.

29:42.365 --> 29:46.066
Okay. Rick, you kind of tell me
when you want me to advance,

29:46.168 --> 29:47.434
I guess--
I'll go slow.

29:47.536 --> 29:49.003
Any indication
of shaped stones,

29:49.105 --> 29:50.304
or just natural?

29:50.406 --> 29:51.772
No, field--
field rock.

29:51.874 --> 29:53.807
Field rock.

29:53.909 --> 29:56.310
Some ledge rock.

29:56.412 --> 29:58.646
We're in water now.

29:58.748 --> 30:01.749
<i> As it's dropping down,
my initial thought was</i>

30:01.851 --> 30:03.250
<i>this is extremely
well-constructed.</i>

30:03.352 --> 30:04.785
<i>I've built a lot of stone--</i>

30:04.887 --> 30:06.553
<i>worked with a lot of stone
in my life.</i>

30:06.656 --> 30:08.555
The walls hadn't caved in,
they hadn't pushed in.

30:08.658 --> 30:11.659
It was absolutely
perfect construction.

30:11.761 --> 30:16.030
No change in the stonework
or the type of construct.

30:16.132 --> 30:18.465
There are stories
about archways.

30:18.567 --> 30:20.968
There are stories about
a rock that's supposed

30:21.070 --> 30:22.803
to have an "X" carved in it.

30:22.905 --> 30:25.039
Yes, there's supposed to be
something behind the arch,

30:25.141 --> 30:29.143
like... a chamber,
or a vault.

30:29.245 --> 30:30.277
All right, wanna go lower?

30:30.379 --> 30:32.413
Yep.
It's very good clarity.

30:32.515 --> 30:33.781
I mean, it's...

30:33.883 --> 30:37.284
These stones
are strange-looking.

30:37.386 --> 30:39.820
These stones have
angular features.

30:39.922 --> 30:42.456
You know, they're
maybe cut, maybe worked.

30:42.558 --> 30:44.658
They're very smooth,
actually,

30:44.760 --> 30:46.093
on three sides, definitely.

30:46.195 --> 30:47.828
Yeah, they look like
they've been shaped,

30:47.930 --> 30:49.763
or at least split.

30:49.865 --> 30:52.232
Somebody went to a lot
of trouble to build this.

30:52.334 --> 30:53.734
We've found bottom, guys.

30:53.836 --> 30:55.769
Or have come up against
an obstruction, at least.

30:55.871 --> 30:57.638
So we're about 18 feet deep,

30:57.740 --> 30:59.073
is what you're
looking at right now.

30:59.141 --> 31:00.507
And you can't go
any deeper?

31:00.609 --> 31:03.343
When I let it down, I come up
against something solid.

31:03.446 --> 31:05.446
<i> What could be
causing Doug's camera</i>

31:05.548 --> 31:09.016
<i>to come to a halt
at such a shallow depth?</i>

31:09.118 --> 31:11.685
There's some... something
going on here.

31:11.787 --> 31:12.720
-Yeah.
-It appears as though

31:12.822 --> 31:14.621
it's silting in behind.

31:14.724 --> 31:16.790
I don't know if that's
the obstruction he's hitting,

31:16.892 --> 31:18.992
but there has been
no evidence of collapse.

31:19.095 --> 31:21.228
<i> I don't know anything
about well construction.</i>

31:21.330 --> 31:22.596
<i>I mean, this might be</i>

31:22.698 --> 31:24.198
the way wells were done
long ago.

31:28.504 --> 31:32.005
Wait, wait, wait, what is that?

31:32.108 --> 31:34.475
Does that look like floor?

31:34.577 --> 31:35.709
I don't know.

31:35.811 --> 31:37.711
But it's strange.

31:37.813 --> 31:40.380
It looks like flagstones.

31:40.483 --> 31:42.149
Flagstone floor?

31:47.556 --> 31:48.922
I want to show you guys

31:49.024 --> 31:50.791
that we're in the area
of the hatch.

31:50.893 --> 31:54.595
Okay, well, let's go look at it!

31:54.697 --> 31:55.696
There it is.

31:55.798 --> 31:57.965
Holy smokes.

32:05.007 --> 32:06.840
That doesn't look
like soil, does it?

32:06.942 --> 32:09.343
- No. -No, it looks like
flagstones.

32:09.445 --> 32:11.678
That is weird.
Look at this right here.

32:11.781 --> 32:13.313
It's a strange,

32:13.415 --> 32:15.215
very strange, bottom.

32:15.317 --> 32:17.518
I've never heard
of wells with flagstones.

32:17.620 --> 32:20.954
<i> In the town
of New Ross, some 20 miles</i>

32:21.056 --> 32:23.090
<i>north of Oak Island,</i>

32:23.192 --> 32:27.127
<i>Rick Lagina, Charles Barkhouse
and Doug Crowell continue</i>

32:27.229 --> 32:30.731
<i>to explore the inside walls
of an old well.</i>

32:30.833 --> 32:33.534
<i>It is located on property
that researchers believe</i>

32:33.636 --> 32:36.470
<i>was once the site
of a stone castle</i>

32:36.572 --> 32:39.907
<i>built more than 800 years ago
by members</i>

32:40.009 --> 32:41.608
<i>of the Knights Templar.</i>

32:41.710 --> 32:43.277
Now didn't they find flagstone

32:43.379 --> 32:45.212
-at the first level in
the Money Pit? -Yeah, they did

32:45.314 --> 32:47.214
at two feet down they did find
flagstones, yes.

32:47.316 --> 32:49.416
Which, oddly enough,
they believe came from

32:49.518 --> 32:51.051
-the mouth of the Gold River.
-Yeah, that's...

32:51.153 --> 32:53.253
-No way. -Which is...
I'm not kidding you.

32:53.355 --> 32:55.155
Yeah, no. That's true.

32:55.257 --> 32:57.891
<i>Flagstones from the Gold River?</i>

32:57.993 --> 33:00.327
<i>The same river
that also runs directly</i>

33:00.429 --> 33:02.262
<i>through the town of New Ross?</i>

33:02.364 --> 33:04.198
<i>Could Rick and the team
have found</i>

33:04.300 --> 33:06.400
<i>yet another possible connection</i>

33:06.502 --> 33:10.637
<i>between the ruins at this
ancient site and Oak Island?</i>

33:10.739 --> 33:13.173
Flagstones
are not native to Oak Island,

33:13.275 --> 33:15.108
so they believe that's
where they came from.

33:15.211 --> 33:17.177
<i>It's a flat bottom.
There ar e some...</i>

33:17.279 --> 33:20.013
markings in the floor,
if you will.

33:20.115 --> 33:21.982
It looks like a construct.

33:22.084 --> 33:23.917
- It looks like a laid floor.
- Yeah.

33:24.019 --> 33:25.786
Now if you laid the floor,
why would you

33:25.888 --> 33:27.421
lay a floor at
the bottom of a well

33:27.523 --> 33:29.923
unless you were to hide
something beneath the floor?

33:30.025 --> 33:31.892
Maybe it's a ceiling

33:31.994 --> 33:33.961
- and there's another chamber
beneath. - False floor?

33:34.063 --> 33:37.264
I mean, : you hate
to go down that road, but...

33:37.366 --> 33:38.765
Very interesting.

33:38.868 --> 33:40.200
Thanks. I'm coming up.

33:40.269 --> 33:42.569
<i> So, after visiting
the site, is it interesting?</i>

33:42.671 --> 33:45.172
<i>Absolutely, because
I love the mystery,</i>

33:45.274 --> 33:48.141
<i>I love trying
to plumb the depths</i>

33:48.244 --> 33:50.811
<i>of history to resurrect
this story.</i>

33:50.913 --> 33:53.747
<i>But there's still a lot
of research to be done,</i>

33:53.849 --> 33:56.450
and I very much look forward to
the application of hard science

33:56.552 --> 33:59.653
to try to determine
if there is indeed a connection

33:59.755 --> 34:02.022
from Oak Island to New Ross.

34:02.124 --> 34:04.157
Look, there are so many
similarities between

34:04.260 --> 34:06.226
what you intend to do and
what we are currently doing.

34:06.328 --> 34:09.029
You believe there's a wonderful
story here,

34:09.130 --> 34:11.364
we believe there's a story
on Oak Island.

34:11.467 --> 34:13.867
You know, who knows
if there are ties

34:13.969 --> 34:16.803
-to both stories? -Well,
there's this great mystery,

34:16.906 --> 34:19.139
and we've been captivated by it.

34:19.241 --> 34:22.009
We-we need to solve it.

34:22.110 --> 34:24.177
And to that end,
I just want to say:

34:24.280 --> 34:25.946
perhaps we can work together.

34:26.047 --> 34:29.315
You know, we helping you;
I would like to stay in touch.

34:29.418 --> 34:31.385
Okay.
We'll keep you posted.

34:31.487 --> 34:33.320
-Perfect. That's all we can ask.
-Thank you very much.

34:33.422 --> 34:35.789
Again, good luck.
I wish you nothing but the best.

34:35.891 --> 34:37.491
<i> Having found clues
that give credence--</i>

34:37.592 --> 34:39.760
<i>not only to a connection</i>

34:39.862 --> 34:41.328
<i>between Oak Island
and New Ross--</i>

34:41.429 --> 34:44.965
<i>but also to the strange map
from researcher</i>

34:45.067 --> 34:48.368
<i>Zena Halpern, Rick Lagina
has reason to believe</i>

34:48.469 --> 34:51.304
<i>that he and the team
may be on the verge</i>

34:51.407 --> 34:53.206
<i>of a major breakthrough.</i>

34:54.476 --> 34:56.610
<i> My biggest takeaway
from the New Ross experience,</i>

34:56.712 --> 35:00.314
<i>is that there are answers
to be found about Oak Island</i>

35:00.416 --> 35:02.316
perhaps at New Ross.

35:02.418 --> 35:04.051
<i>I mean,
that's what's intriguing.</i>

35:04.153 --> 35:06.620
<i>Where are the answers?</i>

35:06.722 --> 35:09.056
You know, are they
in an archive in Spain?

35:09.158 --> 35:11.825
Are they in a museum
in Portugal?

35:11.927 --> 35:14.962
Are they 17 miles away from us
in New Ross?

35:15.064 --> 35:16.763
That's what was interesting.

35:20.469 --> 35:21.601
<i> Well, I think the well
is the first place</i>

35:21.704 --> 35:23.203
<i>you got to look.</i>

35:23.272 --> 35:25.305
<i>'Cause God knows what
you're gonna find.</i>

35:25.407 --> 35:28.976
Really, it's a question for you.
You're the researcher here.

35:29.078 --> 35:31.144
That's one of our primary leads
we should follow.

35:31.246 --> 35:33.447
<i>NARRATOR After returning
from their trip to New Ross,</i>

35:33.549 --> 35:37.384
<i>Rick Lagina and Charles
Barkhouse meet with other</i>

35:37.486 --> 35:39.686
<i>members of the Oak Island team</i>

35:39.788 --> 35:42.589
<i>at the Mug & Anchor Pub
in Mahone Bay.</i>

35:42.691 --> 35:45.158
It was a very interesting
afternoon, no doubt about it.

35:45.227 --> 35:47.561
<i> They are eager
to share their findings,</i>

35:47.663 --> 35:50.731
<i>and also discuss next steps
in their investigation</i>

35:50.833 --> 35:53.867
<i>of Zena Halpern's
incredible theory.</i>

35:53.969 --> 35:57.104
Zena gave us both La Formule
and the French map.

35:57.206 --> 36:00.207
So, I think we need to
investigate the French map.

36:00.309 --> 36:02.209
I want to look for that hatch.

36:02.311 --> 36:03.543
If it's there,
and there's tunnels

36:03.645 --> 36:05.445
-in the west side
of the island... -Look,

36:05.547 --> 36:07.347
you'll not be getting
a disagreement from any of us

36:07.449 --> 36:08.615
about that.

36:08.717 --> 36:10.484
You find a doorway,

36:10.586 --> 36:13.320
- all bets are off.
- Yes, but...

36:13.422 --> 36:15.088
the hatch was pretty close
to your backyard.

36:15.190 --> 36:17.024
I say we devote some time to

36:17.126 --> 36:18.825
really hunting down this hatch.

36:18.927 --> 36:20.894
I've got a couple ideas
on how we can find it.

36:20.996 --> 36:22.496
You look for a depression.

36:22.598 --> 36:23.530
Dave, didn't you find

36:23.632 --> 36:25.532
a depression somewhere
near your house?

36:25.634 --> 36:28.535
Yeah, that's on lot 22, just on
the other side of my lot line.

36:28.637 --> 36:31.071
I think I know exactly
where it's at.

36:31.173 --> 36:33.273
<i>A depression?</i>

36:33.375 --> 36:34.975
<i>In the same area where</i>

36:35.077 --> 36:37.277
<i>researcher Zena Halpern's
strange map</i>

36:37.379 --> 36:40.080
<i>indicated that a so-called
"hatch" would be located?</i>

36:40.182 --> 36:42.783
<i>Fred and Dan have always said</i>

36:42.885 --> 36:45.852
that the workings underground
here are extensive,

36:45.954 --> 36:48.688
and would it be incredible that
there's a hatch, a trap door,

36:48.791 --> 36:50.290
a back way in, to the
underground workings?

36:50.392 --> 36:52.125
Of course it would be.

36:52.227 --> 36:55.429
Well, maybe we take a better
look at that depression, and...

36:55.531 --> 36:57.330
I say we go with any clue we can

36:57.433 --> 37:00.734
and try to really find this
hatch while we have a chance to.

37:00.836 --> 37:02.836
- It should be explored, yeah?
- No, absolutely.

37:08.927 --> 37:11.194
<i> So this is an anomaly
you located, David?</i>

37:11.296 --> 37:14.164
<i>Yeah, I found it when we were
looking for a deer back here,</i>

37:14.266 --> 37:16.299
<i>- and I almost fell in it.
- Really?</i>

37:16.402 --> 37:19.436
<i> After obtaining
what is reported to be</i>

37:19.538 --> 37:22.039
<i>a centuries-old map
of Oak Island,</i>

37:22.141 --> 37:24.941
<i>Rick, Marty and their team
are eager</i>

37:25.044 --> 37:28.378
<i>to investigate what Dave
Blankenship has just described</i>

37:28.480 --> 37:31.014
<i>as a "strange depression"
in the ground</i>

37:31.116 --> 37:32.916
<i>near his property.</i>

37:33.018 --> 37:36.720
<i> Again, it's chase down
the clues, you know,</i>

37:36.822 --> 37:39.322
<i>and this is indeed
a very intriguing clue.</i>

37:39.425 --> 37:41.925
Would I love it to be
a back door

37:42.027 --> 37:43.960
to the underground workings
under Oak Island?

37:44.063 --> 37:46.196
-Well, I mean, that's...
-You think?

37:46.298 --> 37:47.664
It would be incredible.

37:47.766 --> 37:49.066
I want to show you guys
that we're

37:49.168 --> 37:52.235
in the general area
of the supposed hatch.

37:52.337 --> 37:54.337
Here, let me show you
in the back of the Yukon.

37:54.440 --> 37:55.839
I can project it onto

37:55.941 --> 37:57.674
the French map
that Zena gave us.

37:57.776 --> 37:59.042
- Okay, let's look.
- Look...

37:59.144 --> 38:02.145
The approach I took was

38:02.247 --> 38:05.749
to try to fit the old French map
that Zena gave us

38:05.851 --> 38:08.652
with new satellite imagery.

38:08.754 --> 38:11.354
And so I blew up
the old French map,

38:11.457 --> 38:14.691
and it's really close, and I
want to show you guys, you know,

38:14.793 --> 38:16.893
how close it is
and how much it lines up.

38:16.995 --> 38:18.829
See how bad it's off.

38:18.931 --> 38:22.232
At least the top end of it is,
follows the coast line the same.

38:22.334 --> 38:23.934
- You mean, like...
- It's parallel.

38:24.036 --> 38:26.937
Look at the top of that.
It follows it perfectly.

38:27.039 --> 38:28.739
It's just offset.

38:28.841 --> 38:30.474
-Yeah... And we don't know
how much, and--

38:30.576 --> 38:33.810
that was 1300s-- how much
has eroded off the island.

38:33.912 --> 38:35.445
This is probably as good
as I'm going to get it,

38:35.547 --> 38:36.480
- for now.
- That's good, Jack.

38:36.582 --> 38:38.415
Um... The thing is,

38:38.517 --> 38:40.383
<i>it is in this general area.</i>

38:42.354 --> 38:44.054
Right here,
right underneath it

38:44.156 --> 38:48.125
is where your driveway
meets the main road.

38:48.227 --> 38:51.228
And this little thing down here
is your house.

38:51.330 --> 38:54.498
But right about here
is our search area.

38:54.600 --> 38:56.767
<i>There's this strange map,</i>

38:56.869 --> 38:59.035
there's a description
of the hatch,

38:59.138 --> 39:03.073
there's no GPS coordinates, mind
you, it's just a general area.

39:03.175 --> 39:05.308
<i>Might this lead us somewhere,
might this be the described</i>

39:05.410 --> 39:09.880
<i>hatch on the... on that little
piece of paper? Maybe.</i>

39:09.982 --> 39:12.249
I don't think we have
a very good description

39:12.351 --> 39:14.484
of what the hatch is even
supposed to look like, right?

39:14.586 --> 39:15.919
<i>No, we don't. But that's where</i>

39:16.021 --> 39:19.356
- it ties in. David found
an anomaly... - Yeah.

39:19.458 --> 39:21.858
-A hole over here. Yeah.
-Right about where it should be.

39:21.960 --> 39:25.328
This hatch lands
kind of where David said...

39:25.430 --> 39:27.063
- The hole is.
- Yeah.

39:27.166 --> 39:28.398
It's close enough,
let's go look at it.

39:28.500 --> 39:29.733
Let's go!

39:29.835 --> 39:32.302
All right, well...

39:32.404 --> 39:34.504
well, make sure I'm going
the right direction.

39:34.606 --> 39:36.473
Where should I go in at, David.

39:36.575 --> 39:38.275
Go in here, by the pole.

39:38.377 --> 39:40.110
- Right here?
- Yup.

39:40.212 --> 39:42.946
Give him a wide berth.

39:43.048 --> 39:45.482
With that thing,
you got that right.

39:52.057 --> 39:53.924
Okay,

39:54.026 --> 39:56.326
I think it's clear enough,
we can get through here.

40:13.545 --> 40:16.012
I think this is it here.

40:19.985 --> 40:22.185
Wow.

40:25.324 --> 40:26.623
Holy smokes!

40:30.095 --> 40:32.395
<i> Could the Oak Island
team have just found</i>

40:32.497 --> 40:34.497
<i>the mysterious "hatch"</i>

40:34.600 --> 40:36.466
<i>that was indicated
on Zena Halpern's</i>

40:36.568 --> 40:38.535
<i>14th century map?</i>

40:38.637 --> 40:42.172
<i>If so, what will it reveal?</i>

40:42.274 --> 40:45.041
<i>A back door into the Money Pit?</i>

40:45.143 --> 40:47.477
<i>Or perhaps... a gateway</i>

40:47.579 --> 40:51.581
<i>that leads directly
to an incredible treasure?</i>

40:51.683 --> 40:54.184
That's the oddest thing
on this side of the island.

40:59.258 --> 41:01.992
<i> This season, on
The Curse of Oak Island...</i>

41:02.094 --> 41:04.661
<i>- I hear it.
- It's a historic day.</i>

41:04.763 --> 41:06.096
<i>- Yeah, here she be.
- Now it's time</i>

41:06.198 --> 41:07.731
<i>to dig in the Money Pit.</i>

41:09.434 --> 41:11.334
<i>That's where it started...</i>

41:11.436 --> 41:13.003
<i>and that's where we need
to make it end.</i>

41:13.105 --> 41:15.038
<i>We're throwing everything
we got at this thing.</i>

41:15.140 --> 41:17.507
All right, all right,
let's go. Come on!

41:17.609 --> 41:19.476
It's go time!

41:19.578 --> 41:22.078
<i>Huge gear is coming in.</i>

41:22.180 --> 41:24.514
That's beautiful. It's deeper
than anyone's ever been

41:24.616 --> 41:27.183
in the Money Pit.

41:27.286 --> 41:28.919
- What do you got, Tony?
- I've got a triangle.

41:29.021 --> 41:30.453
This thing's amazing.

41:30.555 --> 41:31.588
<i> Now we have
a bunch of targets.</i>

41:31.690 --> 41:32.622
<i>There is something there.</i>

41:32.724 --> 41:33.957
I found something!

41:34.159 --> 41:36.026
- You can see the cross.
- Templar.

41:36.128 --> 41:38.028
Have you ever seen
anything like this?

41:38.130 --> 41:39.729
No. That's not natural.
