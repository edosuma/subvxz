WEBVTT

00:06.089 --> 00:06.924
What?

00:07.925 --> 00:09.760
What?

00:11.094 --> 00:12.638
Okay,  I  ate the

00:11.094 --> 00:12.638
cupcakes you baked

00:12.680 --> 00:14.598
for Dewey's class

00:12.680 --> 00:14.598
last night.

00:16.099 --> 00:19.353
And I took Dad's license

00:16.099 --> 00:19.353
to make a fake I.D.

00:20.479 --> 00:22.063
And I can't return

00:20.479 --> 00:22.063
your necklace

00:22.105 --> 00:23.524
because I already sold it.

00:25.024 --> 00:26.067
I was just going to say

00:26.109 --> 00:28.111
your shirt didn't go

00:26.109 --> 00:28.111
with your pants.

00:28.153 --> 00:29.905
Oh.

Would you like some more

01:08.986 --> 01:10.111
orange juice, Stevie?

01:10.153 --> 01:14.324
Thank you... Lois.

01:14.366 --> 01:16.117
Stevie's staying at our house

01:14.366 --> 01:16.117
for a week

01:16.159 --> 01:17.745
while his parents are

01:16.159 --> 01:17.745
in Hawaii.

01:17.786 --> 01:19.287
They get tropical drinks

01:17.786 --> 01:19.287
on a beach

01:19.329 --> 01:21.957
while he gets to watch my dad

01:19.329 --> 01:21.957
air-drying in the kitchen.

01:21.999 --> 01:23.375
Did everyone notice the way

01:23.417 --> 01:26.127
Stevie pre-sliced

01:23.417 --> 01:26.127
the grapefruit sections?

01:26.169 --> 01:27.629
It's so nice to have

01:26.169 --> 01:27.629
a boy in the house

01:27.671 --> 01:29.130
who's not

01:27.671 --> 01:29.130
a rude little monster.

01:29.172 --> 01:30.799
Hey, was that shot at me?

01:30.841 --> 01:32.217
Yes, honey, it was.

01:32.259 --> 01:34.135
Hal, I don't have any bread

01:32.259 --> 01:34.135
for Dewey's sandwich.

01:34.177 --> 01:36.137
You're gonna have to stop by the

01:34.177 --> 01:36.137
market on your way to school.

01:36.179 --> 01:37.056
No problem.

01:37.096 --> 01:37.848
Or you could

01:37.096 --> 01:37.848
just give me

01:37.890 --> 01:38.974
money for a hot lunch.

01:39.016 --> 01:40.059
Don't be silly.

01:40.099 --> 01:42.352
Those things aren't nutritious.

01:44.187 --> 01:46.147
Why are we in a liquor store?

01:46.189 --> 01:47.566
For the bread.

01:46.189 --> 01:47.566
Everybody knows

01:47.608 --> 01:49.068
liquor stores have

01:47.608 --> 01:49.068
the best bread in town

01:49.109 --> 01:50.611
(whispers): Ten lottery

01:49.109 --> 01:50.611
tickets, please.

01:50.652 --> 01:52.153
DEWEY:

01:50.652 --> 01:52.153
I don't see any bread.

01:52.195 --> 01:53.864
What are you talking about?

01:52.195 --> 01:53.864
There's melba toast.

01:53.906 --> 01:55.240
If you can't make a

01:53.906 --> 01:55.240
sandwich out of that,

01:55.282 --> 01:56.784
you're just not

01:55.282 --> 01:56.784
trying hard enough.

01:56.825 --> 01:59.160
Oh, my God.

01:59.202 --> 02:00.328
What?

02:00.370 --> 02:03.164
Dewey, I just won

02:00.370 --> 02:03.164
a thousand dollars!

02:03.206 --> 02:04.792
A thousand dollars!

02:04.833 --> 02:06.334
Yes!

02:06.376 --> 02:07.377
(screaming)

02:07.419 --> 02:08.837
What are we going to buy?

02:08.879 --> 02:11.256
We're not going to buy

02:08.879 --> 02:11.256
anything with this, son.

02:11.298 --> 02:15.094
We're going to put this money

02:11.298 --> 02:15.094
right into your college fund.

02:15.135 --> 02:19.014
A secret college fund that your

02:15.135 --> 02:19.014
mother can never know about.

02:22.059 --> 02:25.186
Sometimes when it rains,

02:22.059 --> 02:25.186
they get stuck.

02:25.228 --> 02:27.147
Here.

02:28.231 --> 02:29.483
Thanks.

02:29.524 --> 02:31.693
Uh, Malcolm, right?

02:31.735 --> 02:33.194
Yeah, and I know

02:31.735 --> 02:33.194
you're Alison.

02:33.236 --> 02:34.571
I'm glad we finally talked

02:34.613 --> 02:36.490
after a month of

02:34.613 --> 02:36.490
being locker neighbors.

02:36.531 --> 02:39.034
"Locker neighbors"?

02:39.076 --> 02:40.035
Yeah, we're...

02:40.077 --> 02:41.453
This is my locker.

02:41.495 --> 02:42.830
Oh! You-- locker neigh...

02:42.871 --> 02:44.790
'cause-'cause we're

02:42.871 --> 02:44.790
right next door.

02:44.832 --> 02:46.125
Yeah, that-that's funny.

02:46.166 --> 02:47.668
I-I get it.

02:47.709 --> 02:49.003
(school bell ringing)

02:49.044 --> 02:51.130
Well, uh, see

02:49.044 --> 02:51.130
you, neighbor.

02:51.170 --> 02:53.674
And keep your damn

02:51.170 --> 02:53.674
dog off my lawn!

02:53.715 --> 02:56.677
I-I don't have a dog.

02:56.718 --> 02:59.262
No, no, I was kidding,

02:56.718 --> 02:59.262
because we're neighbors

02:59.304 --> 03:01.015
and sometimes neighbors have

03:01.056 --> 03:02.850
a problem with

03:01.056 --> 03:02.850
their dogs going...

03:02.891 --> 03:05.226
See, I always assume people

03:02.891 --> 03:05.226
know when I'm kidding,

03:05.268 --> 03:06.854
but sometimes it's

03:05.268 --> 03:06.854
just so subtle

03:06.895 --> 03:08.271
I come off sounding

03:06.895 --> 03:08.271
like a jerk.

03:08.313 --> 03:09.857
I mean, not too

03:08.313 --> 03:09.857
subtle for  you.

03:09.898 --> 03:12.233
I don't want to

03:09.898 --> 03:12.233
sound condescending.

03:12.275 --> 03:14.235
It's just I think about

03:12.275 --> 03:14.235
this kind of stuff a lot.

03:14.277 --> 03:17.031
And... I should have stopped

03:14.277 --> 03:17.031
talking 30 seconds ago, right?

03:17.072 --> 03:20.367
Uh, I have to go to gym now.

03:26.331 --> 03:27.875
What is wrong with me?

03:27.916 --> 03:30.251
How long... you got?

03:30.293 --> 03:31.712
I always ruin

03:30.293 --> 03:31.712
everything.

03:31.753 --> 03:33.463
Even with a perfect

03:31.753 --> 03:33.463
girl like Alison.

03:33.505 --> 03:36.550
Alison's a moron.

03:36.591 --> 03:37.718
She's not the problem.

03:37.759 --> 03:39.344
It's me.

03:37.759 --> 03:39.344
I overthink everything.

03:39.386 --> 03:41.429
I can't even carry on

03:39.386 --> 03:41.429
a normal conversation

03:41.471 --> 03:42.848
without screwing it up.

03:42.890 --> 03:44.975
Why won't my brain

03:42.890 --> 03:44.975
just let me be happy?

03:45.017 --> 03:48.603
(giggling)

03:50.022 --> 03:51.272
Honey, I got

03:50.022 --> 03:51.272
to get going.

03:51.314 --> 03:53.150
You heading down

03:51.314 --> 03:53.150
to the art gallery?

03:53.192 --> 03:54.275
It's not art!

03:54.317 --> 03:55.903
Sorry. Heading down

03:54.317 --> 03:55.903
to the place

03:55.944 --> 03:58.279
where you sell overpriced,

03:55.944 --> 03:58.279
pretentious stuff

03:58.321 --> 04:00.281
to tourists with more money

03:58.321 --> 04:00.281
than taste?

04:00.323 --> 04:02.993
You  do  listen.

04:04.786 --> 04:06.287
OTTO:

04:04.786 --> 04:06.287
Thank you very much.

04:06.329 --> 04:09.958
It was good doing business

04:06.329 --> 04:09.958
with you, Mr. Dodson.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.668
Ah, Francis, come.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.668
Meet Mr. Dodson.

04:11.710 --> 04:13.294
He is a wonderful man.

04:13.336 --> 04:16.297
We will be doing lots

04:13.336 --> 04:16.297
of business with him for sure.

04:16.339 --> 04:17.883
Yeah, look, I got to go.

04:17.925 --> 04:19.676
Uh, I'm running late

04:17.925 --> 04:19.676
for another sales call,

04:19.718 --> 04:21.011
so, uh, see you

04:19.718 --> 04:21.011
gentlemen around.

04:21.053 --> 04:22.137
We will talk soon.

04:22.179 --> 04:23.304
Ah, Francis.

04:23.346 --> 04:24.556
I am such a lucky man.

04:24.598 --> 04:26.307
When I left for

04:24.598 --> 04:26.307
this country,

04:26.349 --> 04:29.519
all of my friends are warning

04:26.349 --> 04:29.519
me, "Otto, Otto, be careful.

04:29.561 --> 04:32.022
People will try to take

04:29.561 --> 04:32.022
advantage of you."

04:32.064 --> 04:34.108
But this is

04:32.064 --> 04:34.108
not the case.

04:34.149 --> 04:35.776
Like that Mr. Dodson.

04:35.817 --> 04:39.821
He knows so much more

04:35.817 --> 04:39.821
about ranching than I do.

04:39.863 --> 04:43.992
But does he act all superior

04:39.863 --> 04:43.992
and high and mighty?

04:44.034 --> 04:46.494
No! No! Instead,

04:44.034 --> 04:46.494
he teaches me.

04:46.536 --> 04:48.997
Like before today,

04:46.536 --> 04:48.997
I did not know

04:49.039 --> 04:52.042
that cows need

04:49.039 --> 04:52.042
ultraviolet protection.

04:52.084 --> 04:53.043
What?

04:53.085 --> 04:54.335
What is this stuff?

04:54.377 --> 04:55.545
Sunscreen.

04:55.587 --> 04:56.838
For cows.

04:58.048 --> 04:59.967
Otto, how much did you pay

04:58.048 --> 04:59.967
for this?

05:00.008 --> 05:01.927
$200 a bucket,

05:00.008 --> 05:01.927
plus, of course

05:01.969 --> 05:03.553
the zinc for their noses.

05:03.595 --> 05:05.555
(vehicle departing outside)

05:05.597 --> 05:07.141
Do not worry.

05:07.182 --> 05:09.268
I already paid him.

05:09.309 --> 05:11.937
How much time do I get

05:09.309 --> 05:11.937
for a thousand bucks?

05:11.979 --> 05:13.981
Oh, Mama!

05:14.022 --> 05:16.024
I have been dreaming

05:14.022 --> 05:16.024
about this for years.

05:16.066 --> 05:18.026
What? Are you crazy?

05:18.068 --> 05:20.570
We can't do it at my house.

05:18.068 --> 05:20.570
My family's there.

05:20.612 --> 05:22.405
Uh, but there's a parking lot

05:22.447 --> 05:25.117
near my office

05:22.447 --> 05:25.117
where we can meet.

05:26.409 --> 05:27.995
That's your ground

05:26.409 --> 05:27.995
speed indicator

05:28.036 --> 05:30.164
and that's your

05:28.036 --> 05:30.164
vibration tachometer.

05:30.205 --> 05:31.290
Check.

05:31.331 --> 05:32.791
(laughs):

05:31.331 --> 05:32.791
Yes, sir!

05:32.833 --> 05:35.961
Can't wait to resurface

05:32.833 --> 05:35.961
some roads with this baby.

05:36.003 --> 05:38.088
Wow, looks like you're all set.

05:38.130 --> 05:40.548
Yes. Let me ask you

05:38.130 --> 05:40.548
a hypothetical.

05:40.590 --> 05:45.053
I mean, if I was to accidentally

05:40.590 --> 05:45.053
run over something--

05:45.095 --> 05:46.972
I mean crush it into dust

05:47.014 --> 05:50.517
where they're completely

05:47.014 --> 05:50.517
unrecognizable...

05:52.477 --> 05:56.023
You'd want to center it

05:52.477 --> 05:56.023
in the middle of the drum.

05:56.064 --> 05:59.818
That is, if such

05:56.064 --> 05:59.818
a tragic incident should occur.

05:59.860 --> 06:01.236
Come again?

06:01.278 --> 06:03.280
Look, a lot of our, uh,

06:01.278 --> 06:03.280
"road builders" have

06:03.322 --> 06:05.782
that inevitable fragile item

06:03.322 --> 06:05.782
cross their paths.

06:05.824 --> 06:10.578
And if  I  were to encounter

06:05.824 --> 06:10.578
such a fragile item...?

06:10.620 --> 06:12.413
You'd have no choice

06:10.620 --> 06:12.413
but to speed up

06:12.455 --> 06:15.416
until that item no longer posed

06:12.455 --> 06:15.416
a threat to your road building.

06:15.458 --> 06:17.919
Now sign here,

06:15.458 --> 06:17.919
and you can get to work.

06:29.181 --> 06:31.432
Hoo-hoo-hoo!

06:31.474 --> 06:33.434
(cackles)

06:33.476 --> 06:35.436
I can do better.

06:35.478 --> 06:38.232
Stevie, you are

06:35.478 --> 06:38.232
such an angel.

06:38.273 --> 06:40.734
You are welcome to stay with us

06:38.273 --> 06:40.734
any time your parents go away.

06:40.775 --> 06:42.319
Sure, Hawaii's great,

06:42.361 --> 06:44.154
but we're having fun

06:42.361 --> 06:44.154
right here, huh?

06:44.196 --> 06:46.031
Sure are.

06:46.073 --> 06:48.075
Hey! I didn't buy this.

06:48.116 --> 06:51.452
49 cents less.

06:51.494 --> 06:53.288
With lotion.

06:53.330 --> 06:55.414
Ooh!

06:56.499 --> 06:57.792
(Reese giggling)

07:01.963 --> 07:03.715
Don't you have midterms

07:01.963 --> 07:03.715
to study for, too?

07:03.757 --> 07:05.259
I think I have three tomorrow.

07:05.300 --> 07:06.509
Don't you even care

07:05.300 --> 07:06.509
that if you don't study,

07:06.551 --> 07:07.468
you're going to fail.

07:07.510 --> 07:09.388
Nah.

07:09.428 --> 07:11.390
How do you do that?

07:11.431 --> 07:12.473
What?

07:12.515 --> 07:13.892
How do you go through your life

07:13.934 --> 07:15.476
without worrying that bad things

07:13.934 --> 07:15.476
are going to happen?

07:15.518 --> 07:16.519
I don't know.

07:16.561 --> 07:18.521
I guess if I feel myself

07:16.561 --> 07:18.521
starting to worry,

07:18.563 --> 07:21.108

What?

07:45.048 --> 07:46.674
That girl, Alison,

07:45.048 --> 07:46.674
just asked me

07:46.716 --> 07:49.303
why everyone in the world

07:46.716 --> 07:49.303
has accents except for us.

07:49.344 --> 07:51.430
And instead of going into

07:49.344 --> 07:51.430
this long explanation,

07:51.471 --> 07:52.806
I thought of the

07:51.471 --> 07:52.806
Minty-Mint song.

07:52.847 --> 07:54.515
And all that came

07:52.847 --> 07:54.515
out of my mouth was,

07:54.557 --> 07:56.517
"Because they're weird,"

07:54.557 --> 07:56.517
and she liked it.

07:56.559 --> 07:58.728
Cool.

07:56.559 --> 07:58.728
I could actually feel

07:56.559 --> 07:58.728
my brain click off.

07:58.770 --> 08:01.440
She said I was cute, and

07:58.770 --> 08:01.440
then she touched my shoulder.

08:01.481 --> 08:04.359
Let's keep this

08:01.481 --> 08:04.359
in the family, understand?

08:04.401 --> 08:05.860
Hey, here she comes.

08:06.820 --> 08:08.322
Oh, man.

08:06.820 --> 08:08.322
I just did it once.

08:08.363 --> 08:09.823
What if it was

08:08.363 --> 08:09.823
all just a fluke?

08:09.864 --> 08:11.532
You'll be fine.

08:09.864 --> 08:11.532
I'm too new at this.

08:11.574 --> 08:12.784
Just relax.

08:11.574 --> 08:12.784
But...

08:12.826 --> 08:15.245
Just say what I say.

08:15.287 --> 08:16.455
Hey, Malcolm.

08:16.496 --> 08:19.540
I-I forgot to

08:16.496 --> 08:19.540
ask you something.

08:19.582 --> 08:20.750
Hmm...

08:20.792 --> 08:22.461
Are you okay?

08:22.502 --> 08:24.545
Do you need to get

08:22.502 --> 08:24.545
to class or something?

08:24.587 --> 08:26.173
(indistinct whispering)

08:26.214 --> 08:28.633
No, I'm just killing time

08:28.675 --> 08:30.551
Oh, I know what you mean.

08:30.593 --> 08:32.804

08:30.593 --> 08:32.804

08:40.228 --> 08:42.814
so they can stay home all day

08:40.228 --> 08:42.814
and party hearty.

08:42.856 --> 08:45.942
Oh, my God. I've

08:42.856 --> 08:45.942
thought the same thing.

08:45.984 --> 08:49.612
(indistinct whispering)

08:49.654 --> 08:51.865
I, uh...

08:53.825 --> 08:56.577
I think it'd be cool

08:53.825 --> 08:56.577
if they took the one-dollar bill

08:56.619 --> 08:58.997
and changed it

08:56.619 --> 08:58.997
to the million-dollar bill.

08:59.039 --> 09:02.417
That way, nobody would be poor,

08:59.039 --> 09:02.417
and we'd all be millionaires.

09:02.459 --> 09:03.668
That is such a cool idea.

Usually I'd be all stressed out

11:03.330 --> 11:04.705
No. For two days,

11:04.747 --> 11:08.293
I've acted like someone

11:04.747 --> 11:08.293

11:08.335 --> 11:09.628
You're turning into Reese.

So? I'm not stressing

11:09.669 --> 11:11.296
out about school

11:11.338 --> 11:12.422
and girls and stuff.

11:12.464 --> 11:13.714
That doesn't make me

11:12.464 --> 11:13.714

11:13.756 --> 11:15.716
That makes me

11:13.756 --> 11:15.716

The brain is a muscle.

11:18.178 --> 11:20.221

11:20.263 --> 11:21.889
But maybe if you

11:20.263 --> 11:21.889
use it too much,

11:21.931 --> 11:23.224
it'll cramp up on you.

11:23.266 --> 11:25.185
Didn't think about

11:47.081 --> 11:49.376
to take me ice-skating today.

11:49.417 --> 11:50.751
Where were you?

11:50.793 --> 11:52.753
I'm sorry, Dewey.

11:50.793 --> 11:52.753
I got stuck at the office.

11:52.795 --> 11:54.047
So, Hal, I called

11:52.795 --> 11:54.047
the office today

11:54.088 --> 11:55.131
and they said you took

11:54.088 --> 11:55.131
the whole day off.

11:55.173 --> 11:56.675
That's right.

11:56.715 --> 11:57.758
I spent the whole day

11:56.715 --> 11:57.758
ice-skating with Dewey.

11:57.800 --> 11:58.968
Oh, you should see the boy,

11:57.800 --> 11:58.968
Lois.

Twirling and jumping

11:59.010 --> 12:01.846

12:01.888 --> 12:03.139
He did a double axel

12:03.181 --> 12:04.974
that was, quite frankly,

12:03.181 --> 12:04.974
exquisite.

12:05.016 --> 12:07.018
Hal, we've got

12:05.016 --> 12:07.018
to go over

12:07.060 --> 12:08.603
next month's budget tonight.

12:08.645 --> 12:10.063
Oh, I can't tonight, honey.

12:10.104 --> 12:11.814
I have to go into the office

12:10.104 --> 12:11.814
to make up for the time

12:11.856 --> 12:13.233
I missed with Dewey.

12:13.274 --> 12:15.026
Yeah, the office.

12:16.486 --> 12:19.780
Can't get enough

12:16.486 --> 12:19.780
of the good ol' office.

12:19.822 --> 12:22.158
(phone rings)

12:22.200 --> 12:23.702
Hello?

12:23.742 --> 12:24.994
Malcolm, good, you're home.

12:23.742 --> 12:24.994
Listen.

12:25.036 --> 12:26.787
Is there some scientific way

12:25.036 --> 12:26.787
to find out

12:26.829 --> 12:28.789
if something is pudding

12:26.829 --> 12:28.789
without actually tasting it?

12:28.831 --> 12:30.166
Is it chocolate?

12:30.208 --> 12:31.626
No. Why, would that make

12:30.208 --> 12:31.626
a difference?

12:31.668 --> 12:32.793
I like chocolate.

12:32.835 --> 12:34.795
It's browner than

12:32.835 --> 12:34.795
the not-chocolate stuff.

12:34.837 --> 12:38.508
You didn't by any chance

12:34.837 --> 12:38.508
find that coffee can

12:38.550 --> 12:40.759
in the garage, did you?

12:43.471 --> 12:44.847
You're going

12:43.471 --> 12:44.847
to the steamroller,

12:44.889 --> 12:46.266
aren't you?

12:46.307 --> 12:47.808
So what if I am? I rented it.

12:47.850 --> 12:49.894
Why shouldn't I get to use it?

12:47.850 --> 12:49.894
It's a free country.

12:49.936 --> 12:52.439
Dad, you've been crushing things

12:49.936 --> 12:52.439
for five days straight.

12:52.480 --> 12:53.523
Have you even slept?

12:53.565 --> 12:54.815
That's the thing, Dewey.

12:54.857 --> 12:56.401
Ever since I got

12:54.857 --> 12:56.401
the steamroller,

12:56.443 --> 12:57.860
I don't have to sleep.

12:57.902 --> 12:59.820
It's like the laws of

12:57.902 --> 12:59.820
nature don't apply to me.

12:59.862 --> 13:01.406
What's this?

13:01.448 --> 13:04.659
Nothing.

13:01.448 --> 13:04.659
It's a brochure

13:01.448 --> 13:04.659
for a wrecking ball.

13:04.701 --> 13:06.244
It's not even mine, okay?

13:06.286 --> 13:08.455
I'm just holding it

13:06.286 --> 13:08.455
for a friend.

13:08.496 --> 13:11.124
Dad, I think you have

13:08.496 --> 13:11.124
a problem.

13:11.165 --> 13:13.460
Why can't everyone

13:11.165 --> 13:13.460
just leave me alone?!

13:19.798 --> 13:21.635
Check out

13:19.798 --> 13:21.635
this awesome story.

13:21.676 --> 13:22.843
So I thought

13:21.676 --> 13:22.843
I was going

13:22.885 --> 13:24.638
to borrow Reese's

13:22.885 --> 13:24.638
tuxedo T-shirt

13:24.679 --> 13:27.515
for the dance tonight, but

13:24.679 --> 13:27.515
then I saw one at the mall

13:27.557 --> 13:29.892
that said, "FBI--

13:27.557 --> 13:29.892
Federal Booby Inspector."

13:29.934 --> 13:31.894
Federal Booby Inspector!

13:31.936 --> 13:33.438
Awesome.

13:33.480 --> 13:35.856
You... the man.

13:35.898 --> 13:38.359
Malcolm, I know I promised

13:35.898 --> 13:38.359
you the tuxedo shirt,

13:38.401 --> 13:41.946
but I saw this at the mall,

13:38.401 --> 13:41.946
and I think it's way better.

13:41.988 --> 13:43.239
Oh, my God!

13:43.281 --> 13:44.532
I was going to buy this

13:43.281 --> 13:44.532
after school!

13:44.574 --> 13:46.200
No way!

13:44.574 --> 13:46.200
Righteous!

13:47.744 --> 13:50.871
Whoa. Stevie, you got to let

13:47.744 --> 13:50.871
Reese head-butt you.

13:50.913 --> 13:52.081
It's like getting hit

13:50.913 --> 13:52.081
in the head

13:52.123 --> 13:53.166
with something really hard.

13:53.207 --> 13:56.877
Not... in this... lifetime.

13:56.919 --> 13:58.045
Your call.

13:58.087 --> 13:59.506
Maybe we'll do one later

13:58.087 --> 13:59.506
at the dance.

13:59.547 --> 14:01.882
Go... with you?

14:01.924 --> 14:03.551
Ha...

14:03.593 --> 14:06.721
ha...

14:06.763 --> 14:07.888
ha.

14:07.930 --> 14:08.889
Come on, Stevie.

14:08.931 --> 14:09.932
You got to come with us.

14:09.974 --> 14:11.685
We're like the Three Musketeers.

14:11.726 --> 14:13.894
You can't have

14:11.726 --> 14:13.894
the Three Musketeers without...

14:13.936 --> 14:14.895
what's his name.

14:14.937 --> 14:16.481
Nougat.

14:14.937 --> 14:16.481
Yeah, that dude.

14:16.523 --> 14:19.942
I'll be quilting.

14:19.984 --> 14:21.902
Fabrizzi's a master.

14:21.944 --> 14:23.904
The desert

14:21.944 --> 14:23.904
is practically alive.

14:23.946 --> 14:26.949
It looks like the dolphin

14:23.946 --> 14:26.949
and the tiger are dancing.

14:26.991 --> 14:28.576
Could I get this picture

14:28.618 --> 14:30.995
but with my husband's face

14:28.618 --> 14:30.995
where the dolphin is?

14:31.037 --> 14:32.831
Well, like all

14:31.037 --> 14:32.831
great artists,

14:32.872 --> 14:35.208
he'll do absolutely

14:32.872 --> 14:35.208
anything for money.

14:36.543 --> 14:37.502
(panting)

14:37.544 --> 14:38.628
Oh, my God!

14:38.670 --> 14:40.004
Francis, what happened?

14:40.046 --> 14:42.382
You are going

14:40.046 --> 14:42.382
to be so proud of me.

14:42.423 --> 14:44.175
I was putting gas

14:42.423 --> 14:44.175
in the van,

14:44.217 --> 14:46.636
and this guy walked

14:44.217 --> 14:46.636
out of the men's room.

14:46.678 --> 14:48.221
The sunscreen guy!

14:48.262 --> 14:49.806
And when I saw,

14:49.848 --> 14:51.516
it was like I became

14:49.848 --> 14:51.516
this wild animal.

14:51.558 --> 14:52.851
Like nature took over.

14:52.892 --> 14:55.562
I ran up to him

14:52.892 --> 14:55.562
and I blindsided him

14:55.603 --> 14:57.104
with the windshield-wiper

14:55.603 --> 14:57.104
squeegee,

14:57.146 --> 14:58.648
and his Big Gulp went flying

14:58.690 --> 15:00.316
and he was crying

14:58.690 --> 15:00.316
for his mother!

15:00.358 --> 15:01.984
Do you want

15:00.358 --> 15:01.984
to see his front tooth?

15:02.026 --> 15:03.570
You know what?

15:02.026 --> 15:03.570
I'm going to think about it

15:03.611 --> 15:05.946
and maybe come back

15:03.611 --> 15:05.946
another time.

15:05.988 --> 15:07.782
Why are you whistling?

15:07.824 --> 15:08.949
Honey, listen.

15:08.991 --> 15:10.451
I really want to

15:08.991 --> 15:10.451
hear about this,

15:10.493 --> 15:12.953
but I kind of told my boss

15:10.493 --> 15:12.953
I'm not trailer trash,

15:12.995 --> 15:14.664
and you're blowing

15:12.995 --> 15:14.664
my cover.

15:14.706 --> 15:16.833
These little cuts

15:14.706 --> 15:16.833
and bruises?

15:16.875 --> 15:20.670
These here are the symbols

15:16.875 --> 15:20.670
of my success.

15:20.712 --> 15:22.004
I mean, the guy took

15:20.712 --> 15:22.004
some convincing,

15:22.046 --> 15:23.631
but in the end,

15:23.673 --> 15:26.342
the money was

15:23.673 --> 15:26.342
cheerfully refunded.

15:26.384 --> 15:29.970
Is there supposed to be

15:26.384 --> 15:29.970
this much blood in my pocket?

15:30.012 --> 15:31.723
Okay, you're going

15:30.012 --> 15:31.723
to the emergency room.

15:39.021 --> 15:40.690
Want some punch?

If I say yes,

15:40.732 --> 15:42.609
you're just going to hit me.

15:42.650 --> 15:44.235
I'm going

15:42.650 --> 15:44.235
to hit you anyway,

15:44.277 --> 15:46.571
but it's funnier

15:44.277 --> 15:46.571
if you say yes first.

15:46.613 --> 15:48.281
So what do you

15:46.613 --> 15:48.281
like better,

15:48.322 --> 15:50.366
slow dancing

15:48.322 --> 15:50.366
or fast dancing?

15:50.408 --> 15:53.578
Slow dancing.

15:53.620 --> 15:54.995
Me, too.

15:55.037 --> 15:58.291
Unless the fast dance

15:55.037 --> 15:58.291
song, like, really rocks.

15:58.332 --> 15:59.667
Yeah.

15:59.709 --> 16:02.503
I can't believe

15:59.709 --> 16:02.503
the awesomeness

16:02.545 --> 16:05.381
of how awesome this is.

16:05.423 --> 16:08.593
At Cheswick Grounds,

16:05.423 --> 16:08.593
Britain's largest public lawn,

16:08.635 --> 16:10.720
each blade of grass

16:08.635 --> 16:10.720
is said to grow

16:10.762 --> 16:12.430
a full centimeter a day.

16:12.472 --> 16:13.973
Let's watch.

16:17.059 --> 16:18.478
Stevie, what are you doing here?

16:18.519 --> 16:19.479
I thought you're going

16:18.519 --> 16:19.479
to the dance with the boys.

16:19.520 --> 16:22.440
I didn't want...

16:19.520 --> 16:22.440
to go.

16:24.525 --> 16:27.027
Stevie, you listen to me.

16:27.069 --> 16:29.029
Just because you're in

16:27.069 --> 16:29.029
a wheelchair

16:29.071 --> 16:31.407
doesn't mean you can't

16:29.071 --> 16:31.407
enjoy a dance like anyone else.

16:31.449 --> 16:33.827
I think you are a fine young man

16:31.449 --> 16:33.827
with beautiful qualities

16:33.868 --> 16:34.911
that any girl would enjoy

16:34.953 --> 16:36.287
if you just put yourself

16:34.953 --> 16:36.287
out there.

16:36.329 --> 16:38.122
But...

16:36.329 --> 16:38.122
There are plenty

16:36.329 --> 16:38.122
of things you can do.

16:38.164 --> 16:39.916
You can snap your fingers

16:38.164 --> 16:39.916
to the beat.

16:39.958 --> 16:41.668
You can spin around

16:39.958 --> 16:41.668
in a circle.

16:41.709 --> 16:43.043
That would be adorable.

16:43.085 --> 16:44.337
Please...

16:43.085 --> 16:44.337
Stevie, any girl would be lucky

16:44.378 --> 16:45.880
to be your girlfriend.

16:45.922 --> 16:47.548
You're polite,

16:45.922 --> 16:47.548
you're considerate,

16:47.590 --> 16:49.049
and you are very clean.

16:49.091 --> 16:50.092
Girls go crazy for that.

16:50.134 --> 16:51.636
Lois...

16:50.134 --> 16:51.636
Stevie, you know what?

16:51.678 --> 16:53.596
We're going to that dance.

16:54.472 --> 16:56.056
Francis,

16:56.098 --> 16:58.225
what happened to you?

16:58.267 --> 17:00.478
Otto, I have to tell you

16:58.267 --> 17:00.478
something.

17:00.520 --> 17:03.523
There is no such thing

17:00.520 --> 17:03.523
as sunscreen for cows.

17:03.564 --> 17:04.941
What are you

17:03.564 --> 17:04.941
talking about?

17:04.983 --> 17:06.734
The guy, he was

17:04.983 --> 17:06.734
ripping you off.

17:06.776 --> 17:08.778
But don't worry,

17:06.776 --> 17:08.778
I took care of it.

17:08.820 --> 17:10.363
I got you your money back.

17:10.404 --> 17:13.073
Ugh! I am such an idiot.

17:13.115 --> 17:16.953
It is my fault

17:13.115 --> 17:16.953
you had to fight.

17:16.995 --> 17:18.287
I'm sorry. And thank you.

17:18.329 --> 17:19.246
It's okay.

17:19.288 --> 17:20.540
You know what?

17:20.581 --> 17:22.542
There is a man

17:20.581 --> 17:22.542
in my office right now,

17:22.583 --> 17:24.794
and I am suspicious

17:22.583 --> 17:24.794
of him, too.

17:24.836 --> 17:27.005
Come, you will meet him.

17:28.172 --> 17:32.343
Okay, show my friend here

17:28.172 --> 17:32.343
what you are selling me.

17:32.385 --> 17:35.513
This here's a magic stick.

17:32.385 --> 17:35.513
It finds water.

17:39.433 --> 17:40.476
Oh, yeah.

17:40.518 --> 17:42.020
I've seen these.

17:42.061 --> 17:44.939
It's got the good

17:42.061 --> 17:44.939
Swenson bevel on there.

17:44.981 --> 17:46.482
Yeah, these are great.

17:46.524 --> 17:47.901
I don't know.

17:47.942 --> 17:49.986
I guess I'd say

17:47.942 --> 17:49.986
I like curly fries better.

17:50.028 --> 17:51.111
Ha, I knew it.

17:51.153 --> 17:52.739
You totally owe me

17:51.153 --> 17:52.739
a buck, Malcolm.

17:52.780 --> 17:54.281
What about Cajun curly fries?

17:54.323 --> 17:55.491
Oh, my God!

17:55.533 --> 17:57.159
I completely forgot

17:55.533 --> 17:57.159
about those.

17:57.201 --> 17:58.619
Those  are my favorite.

17:58.661 --> 18:00.287
Mine, too.

18:00.329 --> 18:02.749
Why can't they make

18:00.329 --> 18:02.749
more foods curly?

18:02.790 --> 18:05.125
You guys are, like,

18:02.790 --> 18:05.125
the coolest brothers.

18:05.167 --> 18:07.378
I mean, you're both

18:05.167 --> 18:07.378
so easy to talk to.

18:07.420 --> 18:09.839
It's not like

18:07.420 --> 18:09.839
a strain or anything.

18:09.881 --> 18:11.549
Yeah, Reese and I get along

18:09.881 --> 18:11.549
awesome.

18:11.591 --> 18:13.133
It's 'cause

18:11.591 --> 18:13.133
you're so alike.

18:13.175 --> 18:15.135
You should totally check

18:13.175 --> 18:15.135
to make sure

18:15.177 --> 18:17.137
you're not, like, twins

18:15.177 --> 18:17.137
or something.

18:17.179 --> 18:19.139
I'll ask my mom

18:17.179 --> 18:19.139
when I get home.

18:19.181 --> 18:21.141
I just got

18:19.181 --> 18:21.141
a really good idea.

18:21.183 --> 18:23.394
I know this senior

18:21.183 --> 18:23.394
who's got some beer stashed.

18:23.436 --> 18:24.645
No way.

18:24.687 --> 18:26.064
We can grab a six pack

18:24.687 --> 18:26.064
and a blanket

18:26.105 --> 18:27.314
and go down

18:26.105 --> 18:27.314
to the football field.

18:27.356 --> 18:29.191
Awesome.

18:29.233 --> 18:32.445
I can't believe

18:29.233 --> 18:32.445
I'm about to do this.

18:32.486 --> 18:34.363
Underage drinking,

18:32.486 --> 18:34.363
making out with a girl

18:34.405 --> 18:36.365
where we're almost

18:34.405 --> 18:36.365
certain to get caught.

19:10.399 --> 19:11.776
Get away from here, son!

19:11.818 --> 19:14.194
I don't want you to see me

19:11.818 --> 19:14.194
like this!

19:14.236 --> 19:16.489
Dad, you have to stop!

19:16.530 --> 19:18.157
I can't!

19:48.771 --> 19:50.564
I'm proud of you, Dad.

19:52.358 --> 19:54.652
So what yard line

19:52.358 --> 19:54.652
do you want to sit on?

19:54.694 --> 19:56.236
'Cause I was

19:54.694 --> 19:56.236
thinking the 50.

19:56.278 --> 19:58.114
But it's kind

19:56.278 --> 19:58.114
of a long walk.

19:58.156 --> 19:59.699
There's nothing to be nervous

19:58.156 --> 19:59.699
about, Stevie.

19:59.740 --> 20:01.909
I'll dance the first

19:59.740 --> 20:01.909
couple of dances with you.

20:05.079 --> 20:06.246
Hey, stop blaming yourself!

20:06.288 --> 20:08.248
That guy's a complete jerk.

20:08.290 --> 20:10.459
We're going to throw

20:08.290 --> 20:10.459
away his beer, get

20:08.290 --> 20:10.459
someone to take you home,

20:10.501 --> 20:12.503
and you should

20:10.501 --> 20:12.503
totally dump that guy.

20:14.505 --> 20:16.090
That's what I would have done

20:16.132 --> 20:18.300

20:16.132 --> 20:18.300

20:36.318 --> 20:38.905
you asked for this.

20:38.946 --> 20:42.282
How's my gal?

20:42.324 --> 20:43.993
I don't know.

20:42.324 --> 20:43.993
She won't stop screaming.

20:44.035 --> 20:45.786
She hasn't even seen

20:44.035 --> 20:45.786
my report card yet.

20:45.828 --> 20:47.205
The way I figure it,

20:47.246 --> 20:49.289
I have to average

20:47.246 --> 20:49.289
an 8.0 just to break even.

20:49.331 --> 20:52.085
Which might be doable since I

20:49.331 --> 20:52.085
don't have distractions anymore.

20:52.126 --> 20:54.294
Alison dumped me as soon as

20:52.126 --> 20:54.294
I used the word "paradox"

20:54.336 --> 20:55.379
in a sentence.

20:55.421 --> 20:57.090
Welcome back.

20:57.131 --> 21:00.134
Sorry about Alison.

21:00.176 --> 21:01.301
It's no big deal.

21:01.343 --> 21:04.138
I'm still going to be

21:01.343 --> 21:04.138
seeing her around a lot.

21:06.348 --> 21:08.559
You know what I don't

21:06.348 --> 21:08.559
get about football?

21:08.601 --> 21:11.353
How come the away team has

21:08.601 --> 21:11.353
so many different uniforms?

21:11.395 --> 21:13.689
I don't know.

21:11.395 --> 21:13.689
Rich kids.

21:13.731 --> 21:15.315
Probably it.

21:15.357 --> 21:18.569
You want to make out?

21:15.357 --> 21:18.569
Do you? Sure.
