00:01.535 --> 00:03.671
NARRATOR: Tonight, on
The Curse of Oak Island...

00:03.704 --> 00:06.740
If somebody was actually gonna
build this engineering marvel,

00:06.774 --> 00:10.144
it would be Sir Francis Drake.

00:10.178 --> 00:11.679
It's definitely not natural.

00:11.712 --> 00:13.814
And it's perfectly square,
like a chest.

00:13.847 --> 00:16.317
I say we dig it up.

00:16.350 --> 00:18.652
-*
-Whatever it is, it's hard.

00:18.686 --> 00:20.754
Wow, this is really
interesting.

00:20.788 --> 00:23.357
-It's a piece of a finding.

00:23.391 --> 00:25.659
What is bookbinding material
doing at the Money Pit?

00:25.693 --> 00:28.196
Do you think
it's Shakespeare's manuscripts?

00:28.229 --> 00:31.165
*

00:31.199 --> 00:34.768
NARRATOR: There is an island
in the North Atlantic,

00:34.802 --> 00:38.506
where people have been looking
for an incredible treasure

00:38.539 --> 00:41.309
for more than 200 years.

00:41.342 --> 00:44.578
So far, they have found
a stone slab

00:44.612 --> 00:47.515
with strange symbols
carved into it,

00:47.548 --> 00:49.683
17th century coins,

00:49.717 --> 00:52.520
even bits of human bone.

00:52.553 --> 00:57.591
To date, six men have died
trying to solve the mystery.

00:57.625 --> 01:00.461
And, according to legend,

01:00.494 --> 01:03.431
one more will have to die

01:03.464 --> 01:06.534
before the treasure
can be found.

01:06.567 --> 01:08.502
*

01:16.210 --> 01:18.078
*

01:23.484 --> 01:26.220
It is the start of another
exciting day on Oak Island.

01:27.688 --> 01:29.723
-Well, well, well.
-Hey, Rick.

01:29.757 --> 01:33.194
-Welcome back to old friends.

01:33.227 --> 01:36.564
-Oh, Andrew. So, you must be
out of money. -Mr. Rick.

01:36.597 --> 01:38.566
-We're here to collect,

01:38.599 --> 01:42.703
-and I brought the muscle.

01:42.736 --> 01:44.472
-Let's walk over here.
-So you guys got some

01:44.505 --> 01:45.873
-holes in the ground.
-We do.

01:45.906 --> 01:48.742
Looks like a porcupine
over here, doesn't it?

01:48.776 --> 01:51.379
NARRATOR: After drilling
an impressive 44

01:51.412 --> 01:55.249
6-inch wide boreholes to depths
of up to 200 feet,

01:55.283 --> 01:58.719
using a carefully plotted
geotech grid,

01:58.752 --> 02:01.189
brothers Rick
and Marty Lagina,

02:01.222 --> 02:02.923
along with members
of their team,

02:02.956 --> 02:06.194
are convinced they are now
closer than ever

02:06.227 --> 02:10.664
to solving the 222-year-old
Oak Island mystery.

02:10.698 --> 02:13.634
So I assume one of these are the
one that we're gonna focus on?

02:13.667 --> 02:15.569
Right here is H-8.

02:15.603 --> 02:18.172
Personally,
I think we drill down

02:18.206 --> 02:20.508
the old Money Pit right here.

02:20.541 --> 02:22.310
-Okay. Excellent.
-That's what I think.

02:22.343 --> 02:25.213
-*
-MARTY: Let's go!

02:25.246 --> 02:27.915
NARRATOR: Last week,
while running a dual induction

02:27.948 --> 02:29.950
metal detecting device
down a borehole

02:29.983 --> 02:32.853
-known as H-8...
-Yeah.

02:32.886 --> 02:35.323
...the team encountered
a large metal anomaly

02:35.356 --> 02:39.293
at a depth of some 155 feet.

02:39.327 --> 02:41.929
The same approximate depth
where treasure hunters

02:41.962 --> 02:44.398
William Chappell
and Frederick Blair

02:44.432 --> 02:46.300
had reported finding evidence

02:46.334 --> 02:50.771
of a 7-foot high
wooden vault back in 1897.

02:50.804 --> 02:52.773
We're picking something else
up right here,

02:52.806 --> 02:55.776
which would put it
very near the vault.

02:55.809 --> 02:58.779
NARRATOR: It was in this same
hole that the team recovered

02:58.812 --> 03:01.815
-18th century pottery.

03:01.849 --> 03:04.218
NARRATOR: And at a depth
significantly deeper

03:04.252 --> 03:06.954
than previous searchers had
ever been known to explore.

03:06.987 --> 03:09.723
How are we getting pottery
at 190 feet?

03:09.757 --> 03:12.693
-NARRATOR: It was also in H-8

03:12.726 --> 03:15.329
that the team
made their most incredible

03:15.363 --> 03:17.465
and shocking discovery
to date.

03:17.498 --> 03:19.800
We now have results
from the two bones.

03:19.833 --> 03:22.270
Both came back as human.

03:22.303 --> 03:24.872
So there's two different
human bones

03:24.905 --> 03:27.708
in the Money Pit.

03:27.741 --> 03:29.743
I was more or less shocked

03:29.777 --> 03:32.780
that the results
of the DNA analysis on that bone

03:32.813 --> 03:34.515
revealed it to be human.

03:34.548 --> 03:37.618
It certainly brought H-8
to-to a higher degree of--

03:37.651 --> 03:40.954
the necessity
of further investigation.

03:40.988 --> 03:43.424
I mean, it was an "aha" moment.

03:43.457 --> 03:45.759
NARRATOR: Because
of these discoveries,

03:45.793 --> 03:47.895
the Laginas and their team

03:47.928 --> 03:50.931
have invited representatives
from Irving Equipment Limited

03:50.964 --> 03:53.701
back to Oak Island
to help them find out

03:53.734 --> 03:56.904
if H-8 really is
not only the location

03:56.937 --> 03:59.039
of the mysterious
Chappell Vault,

03:59.072 --> 04:01.875
but also
the original Money Pit.

04:01.909 --> 04:04.645
So, H-8. What is the target
depth on that?

04:04.678 --> 04:08.749
143 to 153.
There's a target depth,

04:08.782 --> 04:12.420
a range where we have to be
very, very careful.

04:12.453 --> 04:16.357
We need to be cognizant
of what is there. Absolutely.

04:16.390 --> 04:18.292
This is
the critical area here

04:18.326 --> 04:20.594
that has to be as level
as we can humanly make it

04:20.628 --> 04:22.463
because that's where the crane
sits and the oscillator sits.

04:22.496 --> 04:24.598
That correlates
to how straight your hole is

04:24.632 --> 04:26.534
at the end of the day.

04:26.567 --> 04:29.337
NARRATOR: In an effort to get
to the bottom of H-8,

04:29.370 --> 04:30.771
the team will widen
the borehole

04:30.804 --> 04:32.806
to approximately 50-inches

04:32.840 --> 04:34.942
using steel caissons,

04:34.975 --> 04:39.947
and then drill down to a target
depth of some 200 feet.

04:39.980 --> 04:41.949
This surface deal
shouldn't be that much. Right?

04:41.982 --> 04:44.885
This is, this is pretty minor.
Cost is all relative.

04:44.918 --> 04:47.488
I mean, when you hit what you're
gonna hit here soon.

04:47.521 --> 04:49.957
We're gonna hit it! And then the
cost don't mean !

04:49.990 --> 04:51.925
That's right. That's right.

04:51.959 --> 04:53.961
Look, I think we've all got
our marching orders,

04:53.994 --> 04:55.796
but look, we want to--
we want to say thank you.

04:55.829 --> 04:58.399
Yes. Thank you very much
for allowing us to come back.

04:58.432 --> 05:00.901
-Good to see you back.
-Yes. Absolutely.

05:00.934 --> 05:04.505
NARRATOR: While preparations
for the large-scale excavation

05:04.538 --> 05:06.707
of H-8 begin
at the Money Pit...

05:06.740 --> 05:09.577
Rick Lagina and members
of the Oak Island team

05:09.610 --> 05:13.747
have arranged to meet with
area historian, Paul Speed.

05:13.781 --> 05:15.749
Upon hearing the news

05:15.783 --> 05:18.919
of last week's incredible
discoveries in borehole H-8,

05:18.952 --> 05:22.756
Paul believes his research
can help the Laginas identify

05:22.790 --> 05:25.559
not only what might be
buried in the Money Pit,

05:25.593 --> 05:28.962
but why human bones
have been found there.

05:28.996 --> 05:31.031
So, gentlemen,
Mr. Paul Speed is here.

05:31.064 --> 05:33.701
He has developed a theory,

05:33.734 --> 05:36.770
and he comes from the world
of pirates and privateers.

05:36.804 --> 05:38.772
-Yay, Charles.
-And he...

05:38.806 --> 05:41.442
He can, I believe,
shed some light

05:41.475 --> 05:42.843
on perhaps the who,
what, when, where,

05:42.876 --> 05:44.645
why and how of Oak Island.

05:44.678 --> 05:46.647
And I very much look
forward to your presentation,

05:46.680 --> 05:49.116
and I welcome you
to the war room.

05:49.149 --> 05:52.520
Well, it's an absolute thrill
to be in the war room.

05:52.553 --> 05:56.123
A number of years ago,
a good friend of mine and me

05:56.156 --> 06:00.127
were discussing the Oak Island
mystery, and we thought,

06:00.160 --> 06:03.564
if somebody was actually gonna
build this engineering marvel,

06:03.597 --> 06:05.499
who and how could they do it?

06:05.533 --> 06:08.902
Was there somebody that had
the technique to do this

06:08.936 --> 06:11.839
-between the 15 and 1700s.
-Mm-hmm.

06:11.872 --> 06:16.009
The Cornish miners in England
were brought to mind.

06:16.043 --> 06:20.448
They developed a way of mining
under the ocean floor,

06:20.481 --> 06:24.485
so close to the ocean,
that when there was a storm,

06:24.518 --> 06:26.887
they could actually hear
the rocks and boulders

06:26.920 --> 06:29.490
rolling over on top of them.

06:29.523 --> 06:31.825
-*
-NARRATOR: Along the coast

06:31.859 --> 06:34.628
of the Cornwall region
of the United Kingdom,

06:34.662 --> 06:37.064
miners looking for tin
and copper

06:37.097 --> 06:39.099
would dig intricate
labyrinths of tunnels

06:39.132 --> 06:40.901
under the ocean floor

06:40.934 --> 06:44.738
using a method known as
"coastal mining."

06:44.772 --> 06:46.206
According to historians,

06:46.239 --> 06:49.943
the practice dates back
some 3500 years,

06:49.977 --> 06:52.079
and was only recently banned,

06:52.112 --> 06:56.116
largely due to safety
and environmental issues.

06:56.149 --> 06:58.819
Is it possible
that this technique was used

06:58.852 --> 07:00.688
to dig the Money Pit,

07:00.721 --> 07:03.657
as well as the maze of flood
tunnels on Oak Island,

07:03.691 --> 07:07.561
not by digging straight down,
but by digging sideways,

07:07.595 --> 07:09.229
either from Smith's Cove

07:09.262 --> 07:11.632
or from another area
of the island?

07:11.665 --> 07:12.866
*

07:12.900 --> 07:15.068
So, again,
we're in the 1500s.

07:15.102 --> 07:18.005
Now I want to find myself
a pirate,

07:18.038 --> 07:23.744
a character who is from
the Cornwall/Plymouth area.

07:23.777 --> 07:26.714
*

07:29.049 --> 07:31.184
And this is my guy.

07:32.686 --> 07:34.888
RICK:
Drake.

07:34.922 --> 07:37.491
PAUL:
Sir Francis Drake.

07:37.525 --> 07:38.759
*

07:38.792 --> 07:41.662
NARRATOR:
Sir Francis Drake?

07:41.695 --> 07:45.065
The 16th century British
nobleman and privateer

07:45.098 --> 07:48.602
who sailed the seas
in search of Spanish treasure

07:48.636 --> 07:51.772
during the reign
of Queen Elizabeth the first?

07:52.906 --> 07:55.208
At that time, Francis Drake

07:55.242 --> 07:58.879
was raiding Spanish boats,

07:58.912 --> 08:01.214
but his big prize was

08:01.248 --> 08:05.118
a town called Nombre de Dios,

08:05.152 --> 08:10.057
which was the town where
all the gold from the Incas

08:10.090 --> 08:12.793
would go and be put on boats.

08:12.826 --> 08:15.195
So, here's our opportunity,
guys.

08:15.228 --> 08:18.098
He's raided
all this Spanish gold.

08:18.131 --> 08:19.833
He didn't bring back all of it.

08:19.867 --> 08:23.070
There was too much
for him to carry.

08:23.103 --> 08:25.272
He can go back for it,
and he can hide it.

08:25.305 --> 08:28.942
And where is he gonna hide it?
Well, Canada.

08:28.976 --> 08:32.780
*

08:32.813 --> 08:36.283
I had always heard that it was
merely speculative

08:36.316 --> 08:39.953
that Drake had come
to this part of the world.

08:39.987 --> 08:41.955
Drake's logs were never found.

08:41.989 --> 08:44.592
-Correct.
-Is there any way,

08:44.625 --> 08:47.661
through records,
that can prove

08:47.695 --> 08:50.864
that Drake was-was up
in the North Atlantic?

08:50.898 --> 08:53.233
Is there documented evidence
of that?

08:53.266 --> 08:57.671
I'm thinking more
of re-reverse engineering.

08:57.705 --> 09:00.841
The fact that his records
aren't there.

09:00.874 --> 09:04.144
There was something
very seriously going on here

09:04.177 --> 09:06.213
at that time for the English.

09:06.246 --> 09:08.315
And they wanted to keep the
secret of Oak Island

09:08.348 --> 09:10.117
going for a while.

09:10.150 --> 09:12.620
They absolutely could.

09:12.653 --> 09:18.191
Do you think that, if Drake
did this construct here,

09:18.225 --> 09:22.129
did he do it as a bank,
if you will?

09:22.162 --> 09:24.932
In other words, was he gonna
continue to come back?

09:24.965 --> 09:27.935
Absolutely.
I think it was a vault,

09:27.968 --> 09:29.770
and I think that vault

09:29.803 --> 09:33.240
was used by numerous people
throughout history,

09:33.273 --> 09:36.209
until a point
that it wasn't needed,

09:36.243 --> 09:39.947
and it fell from use
and-and fell from memory.

09:39.980 --> 09:41.615
*

09:41.649 --> 09:43.717
NARRATOR:
It has long been speculated

09:43.751 --> 09:45.152
that Oak Island was used

09:45.185 --> 09:47.320
as a secret repository
for treasure

09:47.354 --> 09:51.725
dating as far back as the days
of the Knights Templar.

09:51.759 --> 09:55.162
Could this information have
been known to Sir Francis Drake

09:55.195 --> 09:57.030
and explain why
he might have come

09:57.064 --> 09:59.366
as far north as Nova Scotia

09:59.399 --> 10:02.836
in order to hide Spanish gold?

10:02.870 --> 10:06.406
To me though, the most
interesting, compelling thing

10:06.439 --> 10:11.244
is that Drake, on his last
Caribbean raid,

10:11.278 --> 10:16.049
got dysentery and died
in Colón, Panama.

10:16.083 --> 10:18.919
Here is a guy
who is a national hero,

10:18.952 --> 10:22.990
they put him in a lead coffin
and they filled it with mercury.

10:23.023 --> 10:25.826
They've never found the coffin.
They've looked for the coffin.

10:25.859 --> 10:27.260
And they're still
looking for it.

10:27.294 --> 10:28.796
And they're still looking
for the coffin.

10:28.829 --> 10:32.265
And if Drake truly did
build Oak Island,

10:32.299 --> 10:37.137
then maybe Drake wanted himself
interned, buried.

10:37.170 --> 10:39.039
You think he's buried
on Oak Island?

10:39.072 --> 10:41.008
*

10:45.713 --> 10:47.447
You think he's buried
on Oak Island?

10:47.480 --> 10:51.418
I think when you hit metal,
you might have hit his coffin.

10:51.451 --> 10:55.155
During a meeting with area
historian and researcher,

10:55.188 --> 10:59.893
Paul Speed, Rick Lagina and
members of the Oak Island team

10:59.927 --> 11:03.130
have just heard
an incredible theory.

11:03.163 --> 11:06.199
One that suggests
that Sir Francis Drake,

11:06.233 --> 11:07.467
the 16th century privateer

11:07.500 --> 11:10.003
under England's
Queen Elizabeth,

11:10.037 --> 11:12.239
may not only
have hidden treasure

11:12.272 --> 11:14.141
in the Oak Island Money Pit,

11:14.174 --> 11:18.045
but might also may have been
buried there himself.

11:18.078 --> 11:19.446
You know they've taken mercury

11:19.479 --> 11:21.749
out of the Money Pit
many, many years ago.

11:21.782 --> 11:24.484
-Yeah.
-Supposedly, flasks were found.

11:24.517 --> 11:26.820
-Yes.
-Impregnated with mercury.

11:26.854 --> 11:30.090
On the north side of the island.
Gilbert Hedden found them.

11:30.123 --> 11:33.193
I think that he might
possibly have asked

11:33.226 --> 11:37.364
to be put into this
engineering marvel.

11:37.397 --> 11:40.200
NARRATOR: Is it possible
that Sir Francis Drake

11:40.233 --> 11:42.836
is buried on Oak Island?

11:42.870 --> 11:45.973
And could this explain
why fragments of bone,

11:46.006 --> 11:49.209
along with indications
of a large metal object,

11:49.242 --> 11:52.512
have recently been found
in borehole H

11:52.545 --> 11:54.481
CRAIG: We're picking something
else up right here.

11:54.514 --> 11:57.350
There's definitely a drastic
difference

11:57.384 --> 11:58.819
there from the surroundings.

11:58.852 --> 12:00.754
It went off the chart!

12:00.788 --> 12:02.522
MARTY: There's some big chunk
of metal there.

12:02.555 --> 12:05.058
-Yup.
-Okay.

12:05.092 --> 12:08.228
We've entertained so many
theories and theorists.

12:08.261 --> 12:10.163
So, when Paul suggests

12:10.197 --> 12:13.300
that Drake is buried
on the island...

12:13.333 --> 12:16.837
Is it possible?
Anything's possible.

12:16.870 --> 12:20.808
Sir Francis Drake
was an accomplished individual.

12:20.841 --> 12:22.776
There are mysterious
circumstances

12:22.810 --> 12:25.245
around his life and his death.

12:25.278 --> 12:28.248
So, we have to continue
to keep an open mind

12:28.281 --> 12:30.250
and do our own research.

12:30.283 --> 12:32.920
Well, look, Paul, you've
certainly opened our minds

12:32.953 --> 12:34.788
to another unique possibility,

12:34.822 --> 12:37.090
in terms of what Oak Island
is about,

12:37.124 --> 12:39.392
and we want to thank you
very much for your time,

12:39.426 --> 12:43.931
and we will certainly look
into it with all earnestness.

12:43.964 --> 12:46.800
It was an honor and pleasure
to meet you guys,

12:46.834 --> 12:48.802
and to be allowed
in the war room,

12:48.836 --> 12:51.371
and I hope we did
a little justice.

12:51.404 --> 12:53.306
RICK:
Absolutely.

12:53.340 --> 12:57.310
*

12:57.344 --> 12:59.112
NARRATOR:
As Rick Lagina

12:59.146 --> 13:01.248
concludes his meeting
with Paul Speed...

13:01.281 --> 13:05.185
JACK: All right.
Let me grab my shovel.

13:05.218 --> 13:08.255
NARRATOR: ...treasure hunters
Jack Begley, Charles Barkhouse,

13:08.288 --> 13:11.258
and metal detection expert
Gary Drayton

13:11.291 --> 13:14.527
resume their exploration
of Lot 26.

13:14.561 --> 13:18.198
Joining them is archeologist
Laird Niven.

13:18.231 --> 13:21.368
-We're gonna go over here, guys.

13:21.401 --> 13:23.236
This is Lot 26.

13:23.270 --> 13:25.272
It was at one time owned
by Samuel Ball,

13:25.305 --> 13:28.441
but he actually bought it
from Captain Anderson,

13:28.475 --> 13:31.211
and this is a very interesting
character.

13:31.244 --> 13:33.480
-He was like a double agent.
-Yes.

13:33.513 --> 13:35.515
-*
-NARRATOR: Before Lot 26

13:35.548 --> 13:37.084
was owned
by former 18th century

13:37.117 --> 13:40.053
American slave Samuel Ball,

13:40.087 --> 13:43.290
it belonged
to privateer-turned-pirate,

13:43.323 --> 13:45.558
Captain James Anderson.

13:45.592 --> 13:47.627
Earlier this year,
during a visit

13:47.660 --> 13:51.298
to the home of one of his
descendants, Alex Lagina,

13:51.331 --> 13:54.301
Charles Barkhouse,
Peter Fornetti,

13:54.334 --> 13:56.469
and area historian
Doug Crowell,

13:56.503 --> 13:59.907
were shown one of Anderson's
original sea chests,

13:59.940 --> 14:02.509
along with a set of four keys,

14:02.542 --> 14:06.546
only one of which could be used
to open the antique chest.

14:06.579 --> 14:09.249
STEVE: Now, all those keys
he has in his hand,

14:09.282 --> 14:11.284
that one opens
that treasure chest.

14:11.318 --> 14:13.286
Maybe some other ones could...

14:13.320 --> 14:15.322
ALEX: I couldn't help noticing
there are four keys.

14:15.355 --> 14:17.190
STEVE: Could there been more
treasure chests on the island?

14:17.224 --> 14:20.360
That's what I wonder.

14:20.393 --> 14:22.595
NARRATOR: Could three
of the remaining keys

14:22.629 --> 14:25.365
found with Captain
James Anderson's chest

14:25.398 --> 14:27.600
suggest that
as many as three chests

14:27.634 --> 14:29.569
could be hidden on Oak Island?

14:29.602 --> 14:32.940
Chests containing treasure
collected by Anderson

14:32.973 --> 14:34.942
during his years as a pirate

14:34.975 --> 14:37.477
at the time
of the American Revolution?

14:37.510 --> 14:39.246
*

14:39.279 --> 14:42.382
Well, I say we start
in the clearing, there.

14:42.415 --> 14:45.118
-CHARLES: Okay.
-GARY: Let's go for it.

14:45.152 --> 14:49.289
-*

14:49.322 --> 14:51.358
We're all really anxious
to see

14:51.391 --> 14:53.693
if we're gonna come up with
a pirate chest, or something.

14:53.726 --> 14:55.495
I mean,
it seems far-fetched,

14:55.528 --> 14:59.199
but, at the same time,
this is an old pirate's lot.

14:59.232 --> 15:01.668
I hear you passing up
a lot of bleeps.

15:01.701 --> 15:04.071
Yeah. Trying to find...

15:04.104 --> 15:07.340
anything that sounds good.

15:07.374 --> 15:10.643
It's definitely chirpy
around here.

15:10.677 --> 15:13.580
You think a lot of it's just
trash that's blown up

15:13.613 --> 15:16.649
-from, like, storms and stuff,
or...? -Yeah.

15:16.683 --> 15:19.987
This is the thing,
when you go to places like this,

15:20.020 --> 15:23.356
a lot of the activity
took place down by the water.

15:23.390 --> 15:24.691
Okay.

15:24.724 --> 15:27.560
-So, should we go closer to
the water? -Sounds good.

15:27.594 --> 15:30.998
-You're the expert, lead on.

15:31.031 --> 15:33.733
-GARY: Let's go down this little
clearing, here. -Okay.

15:33.766 --> 15:37.270
Now this is
a little bit different.

15:37.304 --> 15:39.506
So, what's the deal
with the wall, here?

15:39.539 --> 15:41.975
JACK: It looks different
from the other ones.

15:42.009 --> 15:44.444
CHARLES: Like it's flatter
on the surface.

15:44.477 --> 15:46.746
Yeah, it's almost like you could
roll a ball down it, right?

15:46.779 --> 15:48.315
-Exactly.
-CHARLES: Yeah.

15:48.348 --> 15:50.350
JACK: Did Captain Anderson
build this wall?

15:50.383 --> 15:53.620
It's quite possible. We know
he had at least one ship.

15:53.653 --> 15:55.655
Could he have pulled his boat
right up to this

15:55.688 --> 15:57.290
and there was a dock in there?

15:57.324 --> 15:59.759
Look, we know Anderson
was a privateer.

15:59.792 --> 16:01.761
Could he have been using this
as kind of a staging area?

16:01.794 --> 16:03.696
I mean, a walkway or a ramp

16:03.730 --> 16:06.666
that lead
right down to the ocean.

16:06.699 --> 16:08.268
Mm-hmm.

16:08.301 --> 16:11.504
NARRATOR:
A walkway to the ocean?

16:11.538 --> 16:15.242
Could the team really have
discovered a stone ramp?

16:15.275 --> 16:17.677
One that was used
by Captain Anderson

16:17.710 --> 16:21.514
to load and unload goods,
and possible treasure,

16:21.548 --> 16:25.618
from his boat, The Betsy, when
it was anchored just offshore?

16:25.652 --> 16:27.320
*

16:27.354 --> 16:29.522
GARY: I think it's time
to go over the wall.

16:29.556 --> 16:30.590
JACK:
All right.

16:30.623 --> 16:33.460
-GARY: Yeah, let's go down
in this clearing. -Okay.

16:33.493 --> 16:35.728
JACK:
We'll follow you, Gary.

16:35.762 --> 16:38.031
GARY:
Yeah, it's thick back here.

16:38.065 --> 16:41.701
JACK: I don't think we've
detected back here before.

16:41.734 --> 16:44.371
GARY:
Wow.

16:44.404 --> 16:47.640
This is interesting.
What do you think of this?

16:47.674 --> 16:51.244
Almost looks like it's been
cut out on purpose.

16:51.278 --> 16:54.314
Yeah, it's a well-defined
rectangle, it's obvious.

16:54.347 --> 16:58.685
It's definitely not natural,
in my opinion.

16:58.718 --> 17:01.621
Hey, it's a really
good size for a chest.

17:01.654 --> 17:05.658
*

17:05.692 --> 17:08.461
erty

17:08.495 --> 17:11.731
once owned by the infamous
18th century pirate,

17:11.764 --> 17:13.566
Captain James Anderson,

17:13.600 --> 17:17.504
Jack Begley, Charles Barkhouse,
and Gary Drayton,

17:17.537 --> 17:20.407
along with area archeologist,
Laird Niven,

17:20.440 --> 17:21.841
have just discovered

17:21.874 --> 17:23.710
a mysterious man-made
depression

17:23.743 --> 17:25.678
in the ground.

17:25.712 --> 17:28.581
Hey, it's a really good size
for a chest.

17:28.615 --> 17:30.683
*

17:30.717 --> 17:32.619
It sunk out of nowhere.

17:32.652 --> 17:34.787
And you can see it's like...

17:34.821 --> 17:36.756
*

17:39.826 --> 17:42.395
...nice 90-degree angle.

17:42.429 --> 17:44.364
You know, you start thinking,

17:44.397 --> 17:46.833
"Gosh! There's probably
something there."

17:46.866 --> 17:49.436
It could be
Captain Anderson's treasure,

17:49.469 --> 17:51.871
'cause this is his lot.

17:51.904 --> 17:54.707
NARRATOR: Could the strange
depression in the ground

17:54.741 --> 17:57.277
really be an indication of

17:57.310 --> 17:58.778
something
buried beneath the surface?

17:58.811 --> 18:00.747
Perhaps one
of Captain Anderson's

18:00.780 --> 18:03.583
missing treasure chests?

18:03.616 --> 18:06.286
So, it wasn't something that
was heavy sitting down here.

18:06.319 --> 18:09.122
-LAIRD: No.
-No one's dug here recently

18:09.156 --> 18:13.360
and, like, backfilled it.
It doesn't make sense.

18:13.393 --> 18:15.495
A ship could have been
parked nearby.

18:15.528 --> 18:17.730
I mean,
it's all hypothetical.

18:17.764 --> 18:21.534
Why couldn't this be some place
where something was deposited?

18:21.568 --> 18:23.770
-* -I guess
the only thing you would do

18:23.803 --> 18:26.873
is that you'd have to dig it
to see exactly what it is.

18:26.906 --> 18:30.177
-I'd say hand dig it.
-You'd have to hand dig it.

18:30.210 --> 18:32.179
It's a separate permit.

18:32.212 --> 18:33.613
So, that would require
a permit to dig this?

18:33.646 --> 18:35.615
Yeah.

18:35.648 --> 18:38.918
NARRATOR: Because the land
on Lot 26 was once owned

18:38.951 --> 18:43.156
by the former 18th century
American slave, Samuel Ball,

18:43.190 --> 18:46.293
it is considered
a protected site.

18:46.326 --> 18:48.661
For this reason,
in order to excavate

18:48.695 --> 18:50.497
whatever lies buried

18:50.530 --> 18:52.799
below the strange
square-shaped indentation,

18:52.832 --> 18:54.767
the team will need to wait,

18:54.801 --> 18:58.405
at least until they secure
the necessary permissions

18:58.438 --> 19:00.473
from the Canadian government.

19:00.507 --> 19:02.375
JACK: Oh, well,
let's keep looking.

19:02.409 --> 19:05.478
GARY: Let's keep going
down this way, guys.

19:05.512 --> 19:08.715
NARRATOR: While the team
continues to search Lot 26

19:08.748 --> 19:10.717
for more clues...

19:10.750 --> 19:12.652
*

19:12.685 --> 19:14.887
...brothers
Rick and Marty Lagina

19:14.921 --> 19:17.390
along with their partner
Craig Tester,

19:17.424 --> 19:20.393
have returned
to St. Mary's University,

19:20.427 --> 19:23.296
some 50 miles
northeast of Oak Island.

19:23.330 --> 19:25.265
They have come
to meet once again

19:25.298 --> 19:27.300
with Dr. Christa Brosseau

19:27.334 --> 19:29.869
and her associate
Dr. Xiang Yang

19:29.902 --> 19:33.473
to find out if the small bits
of fibrous material

19:33.506 --> 19:36.909
found in borehole H-8
could be some sort of paper

19:36.943 --> 19:38.845
similar to the small piece
of parchment

19:38.878 --> 19:42.749
found in the Chappell Vault
in 1897.

19:42.782 --> 19:45.818
But it kind of looks like
it could be some old parchment.

19:45.852 --> 19:48.655
I think we need to, you know,
have this tested.

19:48.688 --> 19:50.790
*

19:50.823 --> 19:53.993
CHRISTA: All right, so this is
a little, tiny sample.

19:54.026 --> 19:57.430
NARRATOR: Using a high-powered
scanning electron microscope,

19:57.464 --> 19:59.766
Doctors Brosseau and Yang

19:59.799 --> 20:02.269
will be able
to examine the object

20:02.302 --> 20:05.372
and magnify it as many as
tens of thousands of times

20:05.405 --> 20:07.006
its actual size.

20:07.039 --> 20:08.841
They will also be able
to analyze

20:08.875 --> 20:11.778
its chemical composition.

20:11.811 --> 20:14.647
CHRISTA: So, you can see
the elements popping up there.

20:14.681 --> 20:16.716
There's nothing really
surprising there.

20:16.749 --> 20:17.784
Do you see some nitrogen?

20:17.817 --> 20:20.487
I think so. Yeah.

20:20.520 --> 20:23.456
And the hint of nitrogen
indicates that-- I mean,

20:23.490 --> 20:24.791
I'm keenly interested-- if this

20:24.824 --> 20:26.526
is really is a piece
of parchment,

20:26.559 --> 20:30.363
it throws a whole wrinkle
in this search.

20:31.831 --> 20:34.634
CHRISTA: So you can see
all of the fibers.

20:34.667 --> 20:36.303
And so, you know,
the question now is,

20:36.336 --> 20:38.338
what are the fibers made of?

20:38.371 --> 20:41.674
So, parchment would have been
animal skin, so collagen fibers.

20:41.708 --> 20:45.578
So the fact that we see fibers
is encouraging.

20:45.612 --> 20:48.281
NARRATOR:
Dating back over two millennia,

20:48.315 --> 20:50.883
the use of animal skin
as parchment

20:50.917 --> 20:52.885
was largely replaced by cheaper

20:52.919 --> 20:54.554
and more available milled paper

20:54.587 --> 20:56.856
during the advent
of the printing press

20:56.889 --> 20:59.526
in the late 15th century.

20:59.559 --> 21:01.861
In the centuries that followed,

21:01.894 --> 21:04.797
parchment was used
only for special documents,

21:04.831 --> 21:07.767
such as correspondences
between kings,

21:07.800 --> 21:12.038
and for rare or one-of-a-kind
legal declarations,

21:12.071 --> 21:16.376
such as the American
Declaration of Independence.

21:16.409 --> 21:17.710
*

21:17.744 --> 21:19.912
The fact that Dr. Brosseau

21:19.946 --> 21:21.914
has identified the sample
as parchment,

21:21.948 --> 21:23.950
and not plant-based paper,

21:23.983 --> 21:26.819
is a potentially significant
development.

21:26.853 --> 21:30.490
It suggests that
whatever the document was,

21:30.523 --> 21:32.459
it was considered important.

21:32.492 --> 21:35.662
It also suggests
that its location,

21:35.695 --> 21:39.732
some 150 feet below the surface
of Oak Island,

21:39.766 --> 21:41.668
was probably deliberate.

21:41.701 --> 21:43.703
*

21:43.736 --> 21:46.105
Dr. Brosseau's analysis
of that little scrap

21:46.138 --> 21:48.107
that Jack and Dan Henskee found

21:48.140 --> 21:51.578
is very, very exciting to me,
very interesting.

21:51.611 --> 21:53.846
It looked like a piece of vellum
or parchment,

21:53.880 --> 21:55.782
you know, to the eye.

21:55.815 --> 21:59.586
I didn't expect it to stand up
to scientific scrutiny

21:59.619 --> 22:02.922
that it really was some sort of
animal fiber

22:02.955 --> 22:05.091
piece of parchment.
Very intriguing.

22:05.124 --> 22:07.394
-Okay, so...
-XIANG: Move on.

22:07.427 --> 22:10.830
CHRISTA: This is the piece
of black leather.

22:10.863 --> 22:13.966
NARRATOR: Also discovered
in the H-8 spoils

22:14.000 --> 22:16.603
was a tiny piece of what
appeared to be leather,

22:16.636 --> 22:18.638
possibly from a shoe.

22:18.671 --> 22:22.942
But, if so, what would shoe
leather, or any leather,

22:22.975 --> 22:25.144
be doing some 150 feet

22:25.177 --> 22:28.681
beneath the surface
of Oak Island?

22:28.715 --> 22:30.683
CHRISTA:
This is the underside.

22:30.717 --> 22:33.820
But it's dimpled,
and it looks like leather.

22:33.853 --> 22:36.456
And the other side,
we'll look at next.

22:36.489 --> 22:38.357
-*

22:42.429 --> 22:44.897
CHRISTA: Wow, this is
really interesting.

22:44.931 --> 22:46.132
MARTY:
How so?

22:46.165 --> 22:48.167
See, if you look
at the end here,

22:48.200 --> 22:51.438
you can almost see the--
the fiber bundles

22:51.471 --> 22:55.041
that have been then bundled
together to create a textile.

22:55.074 --> 22:59.178
So, if you imagine you're
spinning wool or whatever,

22:59.211 --> 23:01.514
you're going to spin
many strands together

23:01.548 --> 23:03.450
to create a fiber.

23:03.483 --> 23:05.117
So it's almost like the leather
and the textile

23:05.151 --> 23:07.554
were bound together
for some reason.

23:07.587 --> 23:09.589
Traditionally,
one reason would have been

23:09.622 --> 23:11.724
to create a bookbinding.

23:11.758 --> 23:17.664
*

23:17.697 --> 23:19.532
NARRATOR:
Bookbinding?

23:19.566 --> 23:21.601
Could the small pieces
of parchment,

23:21.634 --> 23:23.903
along with the fragment
of leather-binding,

23:23.936 --> 23:26.539
really be evidence
of an ancient book

23:26.573 --> 23:29.876
buried deep within
the Oak Island Money Pit?

23:29.909 --> 23:32.979
CHRISTA: This is the other side
of the same piece.

23:33.012 --> 23:35.047
So you can see it's dimpled.

23:35.081 --> 23:37.517
You can see the two sides
are totally different.

23:37.550 --> 23:39.886
-Very much so.
-Look at the edge a little bit.

23:39.919 --> 23:43.490
See how thick that-- well, there
you go, there's the fibers.

23:43.523 --> 23:44.991
RICK: There's a little piece
right there.

23:45.024 --> 23:46.959
Yeah, so there's the fibers...

23:46.993 --> 23:48.661
-From the other side. -On the
bottom, on the other side.

23:48.695 --> 23:50.129
Yeah, sticking out.

23:50.162 --> 23:53.800
MARTY: Bookbinding?
That's really strange.

23:53.833 --> 23:56.503
Yeah, one of the theories that's
been out there for a long time

23:56.536 --> 23:59.472
is that
it's Shakespeare's manuscripts

23:59.506 --> 24:01.674
that could be buried
at Oak Island.

24:01.708 --> 24:04.711
-CHRISTA: That's pretty cool.
-Now you're showing

24:04.744 --> 24:06.178
what could be a bookbinding.

24:06.212 --> 24:09.048
I guess I would jump to that
theory right away.

24:09.081 --> 24:11.618
-That jumps to Bacon.
-Bacon.

24:11.651 --> 24:13.786
NARRATOR:
Sir Francis Bacon?

24:13.820 --> 24:16.489
The 17th century
British scientist,

24:16.523 --> 24:18.057
explorer, and nobleman?

24:18.090 --> 24:19.692
Of the many Oak Island
theories,

24:19.726 --> 24:21.494
one of the most persistent

24:21.528 --> 24:23.630
suggests that Bacon,

24:23.663 --> 24:26.232
a close friend of acclaimed
Elizabethan poet and playwright

24:26.265 --> 24:29.135
William Shakespeare,
not only financed

24:29.168 --> 24:32.204
the printing of the first
edition of the Bard's plays,

24:32.238 --> 24:35.074
but also planted
numerous clues in the pages

24:35.107 --> 24:38.811
hinting that an incredible
treasure lies buried

24:38.845 --> 24:41.614
on a remote island
in the North Atlantic.

24:41.648 --> 24:43.750
These clues not only suggest

24:43.783 --> 24:46.085
that Shakespeare's
original manuscripts

24:46.118 --> 24:48.788
are buried somewhere deep
within the Money Pit,

24:48.821 --> 24:51.223
but that profound connections
exist

24:51.257 --> 24:53.826
linking Oak Island
to sacred treasures

24:53.860 --> 24:55.762
rescued by the Knights Templar

24:55.795 --> 24:59.131
from the temple of King Solomon
during the Crusades.

24:59.165 --> 25:03.636
But what was Francis Bacon
doing on Oak Island?

25:03.670 --> 25:06.539
And did he learn of the island
and its secrets

25:06.573 --> 25:08.875
from his good friend,
Sir Francis Drake,

25:08.908 --> 25:13.980
sometime before Drake's death
in 1596?

25:14.013 --> 25:16.783
I've always said,
or always believed,

25:16.816 --> 25:19.986
that what's here on Oak Island
is not just temporal wealth,

25:20.019 --> 25:22.722
that there's something
other than that here.

25:22.755 --> 25:25.658
And, you know,
is it ancient knowledge?

25:25.692 --> 25:27.293
Is it Shakespearian folios?

25:27.326 --> 25:31.297
I mean, I don't know. But what
is bookbinding material

25:31.330 --> 25:33.265
doing at those depths
in the Money Pit?

25:33.299 --> 25:36.869
I mean, I-I find that to be
more than intriguing.

25:36.903 --> 25:39.238
It's fascinating.
And I think--

25:39.271 --> 25:42.174
I'm hopeful that there are
documents down there.

25:42.208 --> 25:44.911
It's in what I think to be
the Money Pit.

25:44.944 --> 25:46.913
We need to try and date it.

25:46.946 --> 25:49.582
And, like you suggest,
Christa, have somebody who knows

25:49.616 --> 25:51.117
what bookbindings
are supposed look like.

25:51.150 --> 25:53.620
Yeah, or someone who works
with textiles. Right.

25:53.653 --> 25:56.288
We need to pursue this one,
that's what I'm saying.

25:56.322 --> 25:58.324
I think of all the artifacts,

25:58.357 --> 26:00.860
or items we brought
to Dr. Brosseau,

26:00.893 --> 26:04.030
the results are, um,
very positive.

26:04.063 --> 26:08.267
Most of them would indicate
that there's something

26:08.300 --> 26:11.838
significant about H-8.
Highly significant.

26:11.871 --> 26:13.640
I think it verifies my concept

26:13.673 --> 26:16.308
that we're in the original
Money Pit with that hole.

26:16.342 --> 26:19.045
-Okay. Well, that's great.
-Thank you.

26:19.078 --> 26:21.648
RICK:
Thank you, again.

26:21.681 --> 26:22.949
*

26:31.090 --> 26:32.992
NARRATOR:
Three days after receiving

26:33.025 --> 26:35.094
scientific verification

26:35.127 --> 26:37.096
that fragments of ancient books
and manuscripts

26:37.129 --> 26:39.832
have been found in
the Oak Island Money Pit...

26:39.866 --> 26:41.934
All right, Jack, show us where
this depression is.

26:41.968 --> 26:44.704
NARRATOR: Marty Lagina,
and his son Alex,

26:44.737 --> 26:47.106
-along with Jack Begley...
-It's just right over here.

26:47.139 --> 26:49.308
NARRATOR: Metal detection
expert, Gary Drayton,

26:49.341 --> 26:51.811
and archeologist, Laird Niven,

26:51.844 --> 26:54.947
head to Lot 26 to resume
their exploration

26:54.981 --> 26:58.084
of the mysterious square-shaped
indentation in the ground

26:58.117 --> 27:00.787
they discovered
one week earlier.

27:00.820 --> 27:04.123
Yeah, here it is.

27:04.156 --> 27:06.425
What do you think of this,
Marty?

27:06.458 --> 27:08.928
*

27:08.961 --> 27:11.931
It is peculiar,
I give you that.

27:11.964 --> 27:14.100
-And it's perfectly square.
-MARTY: Yeah.

27:14.133 --> 27:16.803
-Like a chest.
-It is a bit like that.

27:16.836 --> 27:18.871
We did find a chest

27:18.905 --> 27:21.373
and a ring of keys,

27:21.407 --> 27:23.242
one of which opened one chest,
but there's chests,

27:23.275 --> 27:25.678
presumably, still missing.

27:25.712 --> 27:27.680
*

27:27.714 --> 27:30.116
ALEX:
This is so cool.

27:30.149 --> 27:33.285
STEVE: Ah! That one opens
that treasure chest.

27:33.319 --> 27:35.922
Could there have been more
treasure chests on the island?

27:35.955 --> 27:37.824
That's what I wonder.

27:37.857 --> 27:40.927
*

27:40.960 --> 27:43.863
So, he could've buried something
here, or someone could've.

27:43.896 --> 27:45.798
Definitely made my toes tingle,

27:45.832 --> 27:48.367
talking about treasure chests
and then seeing the depression.

27:48.400 --> 27:50.703
-Well, look.

27:50.737 --> 27:53.072
We have an odd feature on the
ground, we're on Oak Island,

27:53.105 --> 27:56.208
we have equipment, we have
people. I say we dig it up.

27:56.242 --> 27:58.310
-And we're okay to dig it up,
right? -Yes.

27:58.344 --> 28:00.179
I think we can get the backhoe
in here pretty easy.

28:00.212 --> 28:01.748
Because there's only
little trees

28:01.781 --> 28:03.315
-right through this slot here.
-Mm-hmm.

28:03.349 --> 28:06.452
So I'll get the chainsaw,
if I can get you guys to

28:06.485 --> 28:08.888
pull the stuff out of the way.
So let's do that.

28:08.921 --> 28:11.057
ALEX:
Cool.

28:11.090 --> 28:13.059
MARTY: Jack found a depression
in the ground

28:13.092 --> 28:16.262
and this is in this continuum
of what's worth doing out here.

28:16.295 --> 28:19.298
-*

28:19.331 --> 28:21.333
I mean,
maybe it's a subsidence,

28:21.367 --> 28:24.136
maybe it could be a place where
somebody buried something.

28:24.170 --> 28:27.006
But it's worth doing, because
the reward could be huge

28:27.039 --> 28:30.877
and the risk or the effort
is minor.

28:30.910 --> 28:33.145
-MARTY: That's good, guys.

28:33.179 --> 28:35.114
-I think so.
-Okay.

28:35.147 --> 28:38.317
You want me metal detecting the
area so we can dump the spoils--

28:38.350 --> 28:40.452
Yeah, I'm thinking, if I put
the spoils right here,

28:40.486 --> 28:43.022
I should be able to swing into
here, dig, put the spoils there.

28:43.055 --> 28:45.892
-Okay. -So yes. Why don't you
metal detect that area?

28:45.925 --> 28:48.427
GARY:
Not even getting any iron.

28:48.460 --> 28:51.397
Well, that's good,
we got a clean area.

28:51.430 --> 28:52.999
So hopefully
all the good signals

28:53.032 --> 28:54.967
come out of the depression.

28:55.001 --> 28:56.969
JACK:
Here comes the backhoe.

28:57.003 --> 29:00.139
-*

29:03.442 --> 29:05.177
ALEX:
That's good.

29:17.356 --> 29:20.492
GARY: He could peel a banana
with this thing.

29:20.526 --> 29:23.395
-*
-There you go.

29:23.429 --> 29:26.232
*

29:36.943 --> 29:38.978
I'll scan it.
-MARTY: Yup.

29:39.011 --> 29:43.349
*

29:43.382 --> 29:48.220
-No, no signals whatsoever.

29:48.254 --> 29:50.489
GARY:
Quiet as a church mouse.

29:52.624 --> 29:56.328
Come on, Captain Anderson.
How deep did you dig this thing?

29:59.298 --> 30:03.269
-No, not yet, guys.
-All right.

30:06.105 --> 30:09.308
-*

30:19.351 --> 30:21.487
Hey, hold up, I think there's
concrete down there.

30:21.520 --> 30:22.989
Yeah, we saw something, Marty.

30:23.022 --> 30:25.892
It looked like
a big chunk of cement.

30:25.925 --> 30:29.395
*

30:29.428 --> 30:31.964
NARRATOR:
Concrete?

30:31.998 --> 30:34.600
Could Marty and the team
have just found evidence

30:34.633 --> 30:36.568
of man-made workings
at the bottom

30:36.602 --> 30:40.106
of the mysterious depression
on Lot 26?

30:40.139 --> 30:42.174
The lot that once belonged

30:42.208 --> 30:44.543
to the notorious
pirate and privateer,

30:44.576 --> 30:47.146
Captain James Anderson?

30:47.179 --> 30:50.082
As I'm digging, all of a sudden
Alex says, "Whoa, stop!"

30:50.116 --> 30:52.919
And, you know, you get a little
jolt of excitement.

30:52.952 --> 30:54.553
These sorts of things happen,

30:54.586 --> 30:56.155
and you can't help
but get excited.

30:58.224 --> 31:00.192
It's not a piece of cement,
is it?

31:00.226 --> 31:03.329
-I think it's a piece of slate.
-Oh.

31:03.362 --> 31:05.497
NARRATOR: The fact
that the object is slate

31:05.531 --> 31:09.101
indicates that it is part
of a natural formation,

31:09.135 --> 31:11.203
as opposed
to man-made concrete,

31:11.237 --> 31:13.272
as the team first suspected.

31:13.305 --> 31:16.242
But then, why does
the indentation

31:16.275 --> 31:19.011
appear so perfectly
square

31:19.045 --> 31:20.980
Could it have been placed
on top of something

31:21.013 --> 31:23.515
buried even deeper
below ground?

31:23.549 --> 31:25.451
I'm gonna go right
down the middle there.

31:25.484 --> 31:27.553
All right!

31:27.586 --> 31:30.022
-*

31:30.056 --> 31:33.392
LAIRD:
Whatever it is, it's hard.

31:33.425 --> 31:35.561
I think that might be bedrock,
Jack.

31:35.594 --> 31:38.064
LAIRD:
Close enough, I'd say.

31:48.107 --> 31:52.111
Guys, we got us here a hole,
with nothing in it.

31:52.144 --> 31:54.180
-ALEX: Yup.
-GARY: Yup.

31:54.213 --> 31:57.116
NARRATOR: Now that the team
has encountered bedrock,

31:57.149 --> 31:59.518
their search of the mysterious
depression in the ground

31:59.551 --> 32:02.521
has hit a disheartening
dead end.

32:02.554 --> 32:04.056
MARTY: In the case of
Captain Anderson,

32:04.090 --> 32:06.358
there are treasure chests
missing.

32:06.392 --> 32:08.260
Just because we didn't find it
doesn't mean it's not there,

32:08.294 --> 32:11.363
or possibly it was moved
previous to us getting there.

32:11.397 --> 32:13.699
NARRATOR:
Could Marty be correct?

32:13.732 --> 32:17.169
Could the square-shaped
impression really be evidence

32:17.203 --> 32:19.038
not of something
buried here now,

32:19.071 --> 32:21.173
but of something buried

32:21.207 --> 32:26.645
and then later dug up some time
ago

32:26.678 --> 32:29.215
After earning his freedom

32:29.248 --> 32:32.718
by fighting on the British side
during the American Revolution,

32:32.751 --> 32:36.655
Samuel Ball moved to Oak Island
in 1786,

32:36.688 --> 32:40.559
where he began a new life
as a simple cabbage farmer.

32:40.592 --> 32:42.728
But within the next five years,

32:42.761 --> 32:45.497
Samuel Ball began
buying up land,

32:45.531 --> 32:49.601
not only on Oak Island,
but on the mainland as well.

32:49.635 --> 32:53.772
So much so, that when he died
in 1846,

32:53.805 --> 32:57.543
he was one of the largest
landowners, and wealthiest men,

32:57.576 --> 32:59.578
in all of Nova Scotia.

32:59.611 --> 33:02.281
Could it be that Samuel Ball
discovered

33:02.314 --> 33:05.784
one of Captain Anderson's
legendary treasure chests?

33:05.817 --> 33:09.221
Or did Captain Anderson
reveal the whereabouts

33:09.255 --> 33:11.590
of his fabled treasure
to Samuel Ball

33:11.623 --> 33:15.527
shortly before Anderson died
in 1796?

33:15.561 --> 33:18.364
Perhaps the answer
still lies buried

33:18.397 --> 33:20.566
somewhere deep
beneath the ground

33:20.599 --> 33:23.769
on Oak Island's Lot 26.

33:23.802 --> 33:27.139
I am not disappointed.
What have I said, all year?

33:27.173 --> 33:28.807
Put an "X"
through a few things.

33:28.840 --> 33:31.343
We can put an "X" through
this spot on the ground.

33:31.377 --> 33:32.711
-Okay. Good job.
-All right.

33:32.744 --> 33:35.547
*

33:40.852 --> 33:44.690
NARRATOR: Two days after the
team's exploration of Lot 26.

33:44.723 --> 33:47.159
-LAIRD: Good morning.

33:47.193 --> 33:49.795
NARRATOR: Rick Lagina
and Dave Blankenship

33:49.828 --> 33:52.664
have invited area archeologist,
Laird Niven,

33:52.698 --> 33:54.666
to the war room.

33:54.700 --> 33:56.735
They are there
to receive the results

33:56.768 --> 34:00.072
of further DNA testing
on the two pieces of human bone

34:00.106 --> 34:03.309
recently recovered
from borehole H-8.

34:03.342 --> 34:05.611
RICK:
Let's get Marty on the phone.

34:05.644 --> 34:09.381
*

34:09.415 --> 34:11.783
-Hey, guys.

34:11.817 --> 34:14.253
NARRATOR: Also joining them
via video conference

34:14.286 --> 34:16.488
is Rick's brother, Marty,

34:16.522 --> 34:19.258
who has been called away
on important business.

34:19.291 --> 34:21.693
I'll call up Dr. Frasier.

34:26.398 --> 34:28.767
Yes, Dr. Frasier, good morning.
I have my brother here,

34:28.800 --> 34:31.437
Marty Lagina,
David Blankenship,

34:31.470 --> 34:34.173
and Laird Niven,
who's our archeologist

34:34.206 --> 34:35.507
that we're working with
on the island.

34:37.243 --> 34:39.278
NARRATOR:
Dr. Timothy Frasier

34:39.311 --> 34:41.347
is an associate professor
of biology

34:41.380 --> 34:43.415
at St. Mary's University.

34:43.449 --> 34:46.752
He has recently performed more
advanced DNA sequencing

34:46.785 --> 34:48.787
on the two bone samples

34:48.820 --> 34:50.789
in hopes of learning
the geographic

34:50.822 --> 34:52.658
and genetic origins
of the humans

34:52.691 --> 34:54.793
who presumably lie buried

34:54.826 --> 34:58.397
some 160 feet deep underground.

35:23.689 --> 35:25.324
That makes sense.

35:33.199 --> 35:36.502
Middle East

35:36.535 --> 35:39.205
*

35:44.243 --> 35:47.913
Wow! That Middle Eastern thing
is pretty eye opening.

35:47.946 --> 35:50.449
Interesting.
That is extremely interesting.

35:50.482 --> 35:52.451
The Middle Eastern thing
clearly supports

35:52.484 --> 35:54.353
the Knights Templar
and things like that.

35:54.386 --> 35:56.688
NARRATOR:
The Knights Templar?

35:56.722 --> 35:59.925
Formed in the 12th century,
the Knights Templar

35:59.958 --> 36:02.661
were a powerful
religious military order

36:02.694 --> 36:05.297
that traveled and settled
across Western Europe

36:05.331 --> 36:08.400
and the Middle East,
guarding Christian Pilgrims

36:08.434 --> 36:11.537
and fighting for control
of the Holy Land.

36:11.570 --> 36:13.772
They are believed
to have amassed

36:13.805 --> 36:17.343
a vast collection of priceless
religious artifacts,

36:17.376 --> 36:19.378
like the Holy Grail,

36:19.411 --> 36:21.813
the Golden Menorah
of King Solomon,

36:21.847 --> 36:25.217
and even
the Ark of the Covenant.

36:25.251 --> 36:28.454
Could DNA evidence
of a body from the Middle East

36:28.487 --> 36:31.823
add fuel to the notion that
the Templars came to Oak Island

36:31.857 --> 36:34.593
to bury the sacred treasures
of the Holy Land

36:34.626 --> 36:37.363
some eight centuries ago?

36:37.396 --> 36:39.365
The treasures the Templars had

36:39.398 --> 36:41.467
supposedly came
from the Mid-East.

36:41.500 --> 36:43.869
It's not a giant stretch
to think one of their band

36:43.902 --> 36:45.771
might have come
from the Mid-East, too.

36:45.804 --> 36:49.708
So, you know, the Mid-East
opens up all kinds of...

36:49.741 --> 36:52.311
things that were
maybe farfetched.

36:52.344 --> 36:54.346
We need to do further testing,
but right now

36:54.380 --> 36:58.016
in this moment,
it-it's an amazing find.

36:58.049 --> 37:01.453
Okay, I think we've come
as far as we can with this.

37:01.487 --> 37:03.789
It's hugely interesting. Thank
you very much. Appreciate it.

37:05.991 --> 37:08.527
Thank you, Dr. Frasier,
appreciate it. Bye.

37:08.560 --> 37:12.498
Wow! Middle East.
Middle East. Really?

37:12.531 --> 37:15.267
-About knocked me off my chair.

37:15.301 --> 37:17.669
I believe he's come our way,
David. Or my way, for sure.

37:17.703 --> 37:19.971
Well, holy smokes, Rick,
I'm a data guy.

37:20.005 --> 37:22.508
I mean, you know, and I--
him saying European,

37:22.541 --> 37:26.878
I get that. But Middle Eastern
people hanging out here.

37:26.912 --> 37:30.782
Wow. I-- wow. You know,
I wasn't ready for that.

37:30.816 --> 37:32.050
Exactly.

37:32.083 --> 37:33.919
It's classic Oak Island,
isn't it?

37:33.952 --> 37:36.054
It's just classic Oak Island,
you know.

37:36.087 --> 37:38.557
Throws up something you
couldn't have even envisioned.

37:38.590 --> 37:40.592
You have somebody
of European descent,

37:40.626 --> 37:42.961
somebody of Middle Eastern
descent here on this island.

37:42.994 --> 37:45.864
Way deep in the Money Pit,
below searcher depth,

37:45.897 --> 37:48.500
so it just corroborates
and verifies

37:48.534 --> 37:51.337
and underscores that H-8
is the place to dig.

37:51.370 --> 37:55.707
-And getting to the bottom of
it, that's what's next. -Mm-hmm.

37:55.741 --> 37:58.310
Guys, that is really,
really exciting,

37:58.344 --> 37:59.978
and super, super interesting.

38:00.011 --> 38:01.613
All right, guys,
thank you very much.

38:01.647 --> 38:03.449
-RICK: All right. See ya.
-DAVE: Thank you, Marty.

38:03.482 --> 38:05.551
-LAIRD: Take care.
-MARTY: Bye.

38:05.584 --> 38:09.621
NARRATOR: On the heels of what
has been a major breakthrough,

38:09.655 --> 38:12.391
Rick Lagina
and Dave Blankenship

38:12.424 --> 38:15.093
head to the Money Pit, where
preparations to the dig site

38:15.126 --> 38:16.628
are now complete.

38:18.864 --> 38:20.966
-Billy.
-Hi, Andrew, I'm David.

38:20.999 --> 38:23.602
NARRATOR: Joining them
once again are representatives

38:23.635 --> 38:25.971
from Irving Equipment Limited,

38:26.004 --> 38:28.674
who have come to give the final
inspection of the area

38:28.707 --> 38:33.044
before the first load of
digging equipment arrives.

38:33.078 --> 38:36.482
We got the pad prepped.
So, what do you think?

38:36.515 --> 38:38.684
Looks great.
Looks real good.

38:38.717 --> 38:40.051
Just what we asked for,
just what you guys said

38:40.085 --> 38:41.687
you were going to do, so...

38:41.720 --> 38:43.522
-It's coming.

38:43.555 --> 38:47.559
Five, six loads today.
Five, six loads tomorrow.

38:47.593 --> 38:49.928
All in all, we're gonna have
about 35 this year.

38:49.961 --> 38:52.631
We're very excited.
We're hoping,

38:52.664 --> 38:55.066
hoping that this is gonna be it.

38:55.100 --> 38:57.603
-We're standing on an answer.
-Yup.

38:57.636 --> 39:00.005
-The shiny stuff. -Well, that's
what we're here to find.

39:00.038 --> 39:01.773
That's what we're here to find.
And that's why you're here.

39:01.807 --> 39:04.009
H-8 is the place.

39:04.042 --> 39:05.511
And I think,
if we're gonna find something,

39:05.544 --> 39:07.012
it's gonna be in that hole.

39:07.045 --> 39:08.847
You're just about
standing on it right now.

39:08.880 --> 39:11.082
Good, good.
"X" marks the spot.

39:11.116 --> 39:13.585
Yeah, that's good karma.
Let's get after it.

39:13.619 --> 39:15.887
-All right, good. Thanks, guys.
-Yup.

39:15.921 --> 39:17.689
RICK:
Here we go.

39:17.723 --> 39:19.625
-*

39:19.658 --> 39:22.494
NARRATOR: For Rick, Marty,
and the Oak Island team,

39:22.528 --> 39:26.732
borehole H-8 has already proven
itself a worthy target

39:26.765 --> 39:30.402
in their quest to find
the original Money Pit.

39:30.436 --> 39:34.172
So far they have found bits
of ancient pottery,

39:34.205 --> 39:36.775
evidence of potentially
priceless books

39:36.808 --> 39:38.877
and manuscripts,

39:38.910 --> 39:41.547
and the remains
of two individuals

39:41.580 --> 39:45.551
whose identities could help
solve this 222-year-old mystery

39:45.584 --> 39:47.185
once and for all.

39:47.218 --> 39:52.057
But now, as an even wider hole
is about to be dug,

39:52.090 --> 39:55.961
another series of questions
remains:

39:55.994 --> 39:58.664
Will the Laginas
and their partners

39:58.697 --> 40:00.566
uncover an incredible treasure,

40:00.599 --> 40:04.570
or evidence
of an ancient curse?

NARRATOR: Next time on
The Curse of Oak Island...

40:10.742 --> 40:13.879
MARTY: Gentlemen, we're almost
there. Dan's breakthrough.

40:13.912 --> 40:16.482
-Time to make history.
-This hole, it starts this day.

40:16.515 --> 40:18.016
Well, I'm dumbfounded.

40:18.049 --> 40:19.718
Those bones
and now this dating...

40:19.751 --> 40:22.020
That fits with Knights Templar.

40:22.053 --> 40:23.555
GARY: Here we go, guys.
Another signal.

40:23.589 --> 40:25.557
Looks like a piece
of ammunition to me.

40:25.591 --> 40:26.658
That's from a cannon.

40:26.692 --> 40:27.893
"Rochefoucauld."

40:27.926 --> 40:29.495
They're a prominent
French family.

40:29.528 --> 40:30.929
This was a family
of crusader kings.

40:30.962 --> 40:34.199
We now have a pathway
from the Holy Land

40:34.232 --> 40:35.467
to Oak Island.
