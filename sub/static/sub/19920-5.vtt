WEBVTT

00:00.086 --> 00:01.593
Previously on "Shots Fired"...

00:01.805 --> 00:03.196
He's saying you refused to get help

00:03.220 --> 00:05.593
for emotional trauma you
suffered on the job.

00:05.906 --> 00:07.203
Unless you show the court

00:07.239 --> 00:09.140
you're working to fix these issues,

00:09.175 --> 00:10.903
you're gonna lose your child.

00:11.077 --> 00:12.677
My initiative is privately funded

00:12.712 --> 00:14.980
by Arlen Cox
and the Cox Group, Financial.

00:17.283 --> 00:20.385
A standing 8:45 tee time
at Crystal Lake.

00:20.419 --> 00:21.553
If you can spare the time.

00:21.587 --> 00:22.954
Well, thank you, sir.

00:22.989 --> 00:24.089
We've been hiding him out

00:24.123 --> 00:25.234
because we didn't know what else to do.

00:25.258 --> 00:26.891
One of them police sedans

00:26.926 --> 00:28.093
chasing down Joey.

00:28.127 --> 00:31.263
An older white man got
out of the car and shot him.

00:31.297 --> 00:32.808
If you saw this man again,
would you recognize him?

00:32.832 --> 00:34.099
Yeah.

00:34.133 --> 00:35.444
So what's the deal with the Houses?

00:35.468 --> 00:37.602
Keep hearing it's like
the Wild West down there.

00:37.637 --> 00:39.871
Personally, I never ran any tours there.

00:39.905 --> 00:40.805
Tours?

00:40.840 --> 00:41.740
It's nothing, it's stupid.

00:41.774 --> 00:44.109
It's like a tour of duty.

00:44.143 --> 00:45.654
The weed that was found
in Jesse's glove compartment.

00:45.678 --> 00:47.412
It's the same strain of marijuana

00:47.446 --> 00:48.813
found on Joey Campbell.

00:48.848 --> 00:50.382
These two cases are connected.

00:50.416 --> 00:52.150
Open up a case on Joey Campbell.

00:52.184 --> 00:53.428
I want to know who murdered him.

00:53.452 --> 00:55.687
I'm proposing
the "Jesse Carr Call 1st" bill.

00:56.756 --> 00:57.889
Can I help you?

00:57.923 --> 00:58.957
I'm in.

01:00.000 --> 01:06.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:32.725 --> 01:35.293
Next caller, you're on the air,
what's your take?

01:35.328 --> 01:37.929
They opened the case on
Joey Campbell to save face.

01:37.963 --> 01:40.937
The DOJ don't care about him.
They don't care about any of us.

01:40.962 --> 01:42.538
They're putting on a show.

01:42.555 --> 01:44.423
And if you think they're
gonna bring justice,

01:44.457 --> 01:45.824
you're kidding yourself.

01:45.858 --> 01:47.592
I'm tired of waiting for people in power

01:47.627 --> 01:48.694
to do the right thing.

01:48.728 --> 01:50.696
It's time we rise up.

01:50.730 --> 01:53.532
Douglass said, "No struggle,
no progress."

01:53.566 --> 01:55.611
But how many more black folks
gotta die before the real...

01:55.635 --> 01:59.004
Sir, can you please turn off the...?

01:59.038 --> 02:00.539
We're gonna be heard.

02:03.242 --> 02:05.160
Next caller, what have you got to say?

02:05.185 --> 02:06.863
That kid in the Houses, I'm sorry,

02:06.888 --> 02:08.513
but that's what happens over there.

02:08.547 --> 02:11.416
That college boy, he had his
whole life ahead of him.

02:11.450 --> 02:12.784
He was unarmed...

02:13.769 --> 02:15.165
Just right this way, ladies.

02:15.190 --> 02:17.889
Are you guys doing okay...
do you need any coffee or water?

02:17.923 --> 02:20.091
There's a crafty table
around the corner.

02:20.126 --> 02:21.136
You can help yourselves
to whatever you need.

02:21.160 --> 02:23.094
Just around the corner.

02:24.964 --> 02:27.142
So we'll get you mic'd and you'll
be on the air in less than three.

02:27.166 --> 02:29.367
Three minutes?

02:29.550 --> 02:33.102
Yeah. Don't be nervous.
It's easier than it looks.

02:39.945 --> 02:41.279
Sorry I'm late.

02:43.282 --> 02:44.682
How are you, Alicia?

02:46.986 --> 02:51.790
Five, four, three, two...

03:05.638 --> 03:07.372
Whoa!

03:07.406 --> 03:09.908
Hey.

03:09.942 --> 03:11.509
Sorry, man.

03:11.544 --> 03:12.777
What the hell is this?

03:12.812 --> 03:14.913
The concierge told me about this spot.

03:14.947 --> 03:17.949
Really, it's a coincidence.

03:19.585 --> 03:21.453
I don't believe in coincidence.

03:21.487 --> 03:23.398
If that's true, how did the
marijuana found in Jesse's car

03:23.422 --> 03:25.256
match the same weed found on Joey?

03:26.826 --> 03:30.195
Jesse went to the hood
for barbecue, not drugs,

03:30.229 --> 03:32.497
yet Joey's weed was found
in his glove compartment.

03:33.566 --> 03:37.101
How does a cop who doesn't believe
in coincidences explain that?

03:37.136 --> 03:39.237
You read the report.

03:39.271 --> 03:41.439
Lieutenant Breeland found
the weed, ask him.

03:41.474 --> 03:43.107
Sounds like Breeland's got your back.

03:43.142 --> 03:45.643
I got my own back.

03:46.846 --> 03:49.581
For what it's worth, I get it.

03:49.615 --> 03:52.083
The pressure, being the only one.

03:56.355 --> 03:59.491
Yeah, we got something in common.

03:59.525 --> 04:01.759
Both of our jobs are
putting brothers away.

04:09.134 --> 04:11.536
I heard y'all opened up
a case for Joey, too.

04:11.570 --> 04:15.073
Yeah. Yeah, you know anything about that?

04:16.475 --> 04:18.976
I know nobody expected y'all
to be here this long.

04:40.756 --> 04:43.298

04:43.402 --> 04:46.571
I'm Amy Holmes, and today
we have an exclusive sit-down

04:46.605 --> 04:49.440
with the women at the center
of this story:

04:49.475 --> 04:51.976
Alicia Carr, Shameeka Campbell,

04:52.011 --> 04:55.380
and the woman that brought them
together, Pastor Janae Jones.

04:55.414 --> 04:57.933
- Thank you, ladies, for joining us.
- Thank you.

04:57.958 --> 05:00.560
Alicia, how are you?

05:01.220 --> 05:05.323
Tired, you know, of waiting.

05:05.357 --> 05:07.692
And Shameeka, how are you coping?

05:07.726 --> 05:11.011
Well, I miss my boy, but people
are looking into things now,

05:11.036 --> 05:12.330
so that's something.

05:12.364 --> 05:14.365
I can't imagine how
frustrated you must feel

05:14.400 --> 05:17.110
about the lack of progress
in your son Joey's case.

05:17.303 --> 05:19.929
Do you think that the
circumstances surrounding

05:19.954 --> 05:23.915
his death may be a contributing
factor to the delay?

05:23.943 --> 05:26.077
I'm sorry, "circumstances"?

05:26.111 --> 05:30.281
Authorities say that Joey's
death was a drug deal gone bad.

05:30.316 --> 05:34.018
Two boys lost their lives.

05:34.053 --> 05:37.255
Both allegedly had drugs on them.

05:37.289 --> 05:40.091
One is being portrayed as a
student with a bright future

05:40.125 --> 05:41.459
and the other, a thug.

05:41.493 --> 05:44.762
Which brings me
to a tough question, Alicia.

05:44.797 --> 05:46.097
We're just learning now

05:46.131 --> 05:48.633
that Jesse's toxicology report shows

05:48.667 --> 05:51.603
that he also had alcohol in his system.

05:51.637 --> 05:53.071
So my question to you, Alicia,

05:53.105 --> 05:55.907
as a mother, were there
any warning signs

05:55.941 --> 05:58.443
that perhaps your son was troubled?

06:05.284 --> 06:06.384
My son...

06:08.387 --> 06:11.723
our sons are the victims.

06:13.559 --> 06:17.228
You've both aligned yourself
with public figures... Pastor Janae

06:17.262 --> 06:20.531
and Governor Eamons'
political opponent, Penn Moder.

06:20.566 --> 06:25.470
Alicia, do you feel like you're getting
the support you need from Mr. Moder?

06:26.972 --> 06:30.156
I'm-I'm sorry, I-I, I was under
the impression that today

06:30.181 --> 06:32.176
was supposed to be about our boys.

06:32.211 --> 06:33.911
It's-it's also about relationships.

06:33.946 --> 06:36.047
And-and yours as well, Pastor Janae.

06:36.081 --> 06:39.751
You have a surprising collaboration
with Governor Eamons.

06:39.785 --> 06:42.920
She credits you with inspiring
her educational initiative.

06:42.955 --> 06:46.858
Her initiative is being funded
by the Cox Group, Financial,

06:46.892 --> 06:51.763
the same company that's building a
private prison in our community.

06:51.797 --> 06:54.065
I had nothing to do with inspiring that.

06:55.734 --> 06:56.634
Morning.

06:56.669 --> 06:59.904
Morning. How was your run?

06:59.938 --> 07:02.807
Beck seemed genuinely surprised
about the matching strains of weed.

07:02.841 --> 07:04.175
You buying it?

07:04.209 --> 07:07.345
Actually, yeah, he covered.

07:07.379 --> 07:08.523
Question is, what is he hiding?

07:08.547 --> 07:10.248
You find anything?

07:10.282 --> 07:13.551
Maybe. I was going through
some of Breeland's reports

07:13.585 --> 07:15.720
and I found a pattern.

07:15.754 --> 07:17.488
Here he's listed
as the arresting officer.

07:17.523 --> 07:21.826
Then in parentheses on the line
below is the name A.D. Koppell.

07:21.860 --> 07:24.195
The name is listed
on a few reports like that.

07:24.229 --> 07:25.235
What do we know about him?

07:25.259 --> 07:27.699
There's no record of an Officer
Koppell of any rank

07:27.733 --> 07:30.201
in Gate Station or surrounding counties.

07:30.235 --> 07:32.870
Sheriff's dispatch acted like
they never heard of him or her.

07:32.905 --> 07:35.206
Well, the department knows
we opened a case on Joey.

07:35.240 --> 07:37.408
Pretty damn sure they're not
going to help us out

07:37.443 --> 07:39.077
with this investigation.

07:39.111 --> 07:41.546
This came in about an hour or so ago.

07:41.580 --> 07:42.680
Who's this?

07:42.715 --> 07:44.682
Forensic artist sat with Cory.

07:44.717 --> 07:46.351
This is Joey's shooter.

07:59.765 --> 08:02.033
Lieutenant, can I get a word?

08:02.067 --> 08:03.668
Sure.

08:19.218 --> 08:22.086
The weed in Jesse's glove
compartment box.

08:22.121 --> 08:23.187
How'd it get there?

08:25.924 --> 08:27.992
What are you asking me, Deputy?

08:28.026 --> 08:29.861
You know what I'm asking you,
Lieutenant.

08:29.895 --> 08:32.163
Was it there before or after
I pulled the kid over?

08:32.197 --> 08:35.566
You know, Josh, I've been
awfully supportive of you

08:35.601 --> 08:36.667
throughout all this.

08:36.702 --> 08:38.770
You don't want me any other way.

08:38.804 --> 08:40.671
Did you tamper with my crime scene?

08:40.706 --> 08:42.073
Did you check the car?

08:42.107 --> 08:43.707
You know I didn't.

08:43.741 --> 08:45.120
Then you better watch
what the hell you're saying.

08:45.144 --> 08:46.421
I'm saying it was a clean shoot.

08:46.445 --> 08:49.313
Not without the evidence I recovered.

08:50.048 --> 08:51.382
You think you own me now?

08:51.416 --> 08:53.576
You think I won't talk about
what's been going on here?

09:03.529 --> 09:06.169
Who's gonna testify on your behalf
when the DOJ presents your case?

09:07.933 --> 09:10.268
You need to remember
who your friends are.

09:23.233 --> 09:24.936
Excuse me.

09:34.235 --> 09:36.937
You hate being asked,
"How are you?" much as I do?

09:38.940 --> 09:40.407
Yeah.

09:40.442 --> 09:42.409
Words don't mean a whole lot.

09:42.444 --> 09:44.278
Sometimes you just need a hug, you know?

09:46.648 --> 09:48.966
I am tired of talking.

09:52.934 --> 09:54.668
What keeps you going?

09:56.571 --> 09:58.973
Music.

09:59.007 --> 10:00.608
When it gets too quiet.

10:00.642 --> 10:06.213
Yeah, I've been wearing out
my Kelly Price playlists lately.

10:06.248 --> 10:09.783
After... after Jesse's funeral,
his girlfriend, Cara,

10:09.818 --> 10:13.153
she sent me a link to this song
I just can't stop listening to.

10:15.257 --> 10:17.091
On the hardest days...

10:17.125 --> 10:18.926
When you want to just stay in bed.

10:20.462 --> 10:21.829
Yeah.

10:26.501 --> 10:29.003
Do you believe our boys are
up there watching all this?

10:36.478 --> 10:38.913
That was rough, I know.

10:38.947 --> 10:40.648
But we're national now.

10:40.682 --> 10:43.150
This kind of coverage
will create so much pressure,

10:43.184 --> 10:46.587
soon enough they'll
have to make an arrest.

10:46.621 --> 10:49.290
You don't have to do any of this.

10:49.324 --> 10:54.161
Pastor, we speak for our sons.

10:54.195 --> 10:56.931
Not you, not your church.

10:56.965 --> 11:00.601
Alicia... I am sorry.

11:00.635 --> 11:03.771
Truly, I never meant
to speak for your son.

11:09.611 --> 11:13.080
I got Thursdays off
if you ever want to,

11:13.114 --> 11:14.949
I don't know, grab coffee or...

11:20.588 --> 11:22.122
You take care of yourself.

11:35.370 --> 11:37.237
Feelings of stress or anxiety?

11:37.272 --> 11:38.839
No.

11:38.873 --> 11:41.442
Excessive drinking
or drug use, reckless behavior,

11:41.476 --> 11:42.676
promiscuity?

11:42.711 --> 11:44.578
That's wrong.

11:44.612 --> 11:46.680
You look tired.

11:46.715 --> 11:49.316
Do you have trouble sleeping?

11:49.351 --> 11:50.818
Sometimes.

11:50.852 --> 11:52.353
What keeps you up?

11:52.387 --> 11:53.754
What doesn't?

11:53.788 --> 11:55.666
Please don't answer
my questions with questions.

11:55.690 --> 11:58.425
Then stop tiptoeing and ask me
what you really want to ask.

11:58.460 --> 12:02.262
Why did you refuse psych
after you killed that teenager?

12:02.297 --> 12:04.732
I'm a self-helper.

12:04.766 --> 12:08.268
Taking a life is bigger
than you imagined.

12:08.303 --> 12:09.470
Do you talk to anybody?

12:09.504 --> 12:11.238
Not really.

12:11.272 --> 12:13.273
- Do you have anybody?
- I have Kai.

12:13.308 --> 12:16.744
Are you struggling
with this separation from her?

12:19.314 --> 12:21.315
You realize just taking up
a half-hour of my time

12:21.349 --> 12:24.018
is not the treatment
the court is hoping to see.

12:32.494 --> 12:36.830
A partner of mine,
only real mentor I ever had,

12:36.865 --> 12:39.266
once told me if you have
one person in your life

12:39.300 --> 12:43.070
who you can just be you with,
you're lucky.

12:43.104 --> 12:45.072
That's Kai.

12:45.106 --> 12:47.508
She's my one person.

12:47.542 --> 12:51.078
So yeah, when I can't
see her, it's hard.

13:05.760 --> 13:07.761
- Hey.
- Hey.

13:07.796 --> 13:10.731
Turns out Koppell wasn't
the only anomaly in the files.

13:10.765 --> 13:12.433
What'd you find?

13:12.467 --> 13:13.901
There's a Sergeant Derkin

13:13.935 --> 13:16.703
partnered with Lieutenant Breeland
on one arrest after another.

13:16.738 --> 13:19.106
Until all of a sudden, he's not.

13:19.140 --> 13:21.475
Not with Breeland, not with anyone.

13:21.509 --> 13:23.977
16 years with the department,
hometown boy,

13:24.012 --> 13:26.713
born and raised in Gate Station,
class of '98.

13:26.748 --> 13:29.116
We're looking for a Sergeant Derkin.

13:29.150 --> 13:30.394
He's no longer with the department.

13:30.418 --> 13:31.552
Why not?

13:31.586 --> 13:33.120
Transferred.

13:33.154 --> 13:34.421
Where?

13:34.456 --> 13:36.790
Out of our jurisdiction. Anything else?

13:36.825 --> 13:38.525
When?

13:45.467 --> 13:47.034
August 31.

13:49.170 --> 13:51.138
August 31.

13:51.172 --> 13:53.607
Two days after Joey was murdered.

13:57.545 --> 13:58.779
Is this a good time?

13:58.813 --> 14:01.582
If by a good time you mean
the worst time, then yes.

14:01.616 --> 14:03.717
You reached out to me.

14:03.751 --> 14:08.555
Sorry, I... we're getting it
from all ends.

14:08.590 --> 14:11.058
Our donors are freaking out
from the town hall backlash,

14:11.092 --> 14:13.594
and having Pastor Janae
criticize our prison jobs agenda

14:13.628 --> 14:15.929
on national TV isn't helping.

14:16.798 --> 14:17.931
And then there's you.

14:17.966 --> 14:20.734
You're working two cases now.

14:20.768 --> 14:22.603
I'm impressed.

14:22.637 --> 14:24.471
But...

14:24.506 --> 14:25.539
No "but"...

14:25.573 --> 14:27.074
I just want to make sure

14:27.108 --> 14:29.153
that the case that brought
you here remains a priority.

14:29.177 --> 14:31.411
"You" want to make sure?

14:31.446 --> 14:33.313
The governor wants to make sure.

14:35.283 --> 14:36.950
And why is the Carr case a priority?

14:36.985 --> 14:39.012
You, you know what I mean.

14:39.037 --> 14:41.188
Actually, no, I don't.
That's why I asked.

14:49.631 --> 14:51.165
Can we start over?

15:02.577 --> 15:03.944
Hey.

15:03.978 --> 15:05.498
Just proofed it. Want me to send it out?

15:05.522 --> 15:08.796
No. Nothing goes out without my approval.

15:09.897 --> 15:12.107
Did you include the request
from the governor...?

15:19.838 --> 15:22.603
_

15:31.272 --> 15:34.107
All right, I have 30 minutes,
and then it's off to Raleigh

15:34.142 --> 15:35.442
to huddle with the boss lady.

15:36.578 --> 15:38.612
Is everything okay?

15:38.646 --> 15:40.514
Sorry, I have to go.

15:53.828 --> 15:55.095
Dr. Koppell!

15:58.633 --> 16:01.034
Hey, there.

16:01.069 --> 16:02.236
Preston Terry.

16:02.270 --> 16:05.405
We met back at the fundraiser
for Governor Eamons.

16:05.440 --> 16:07.774
Of course, at Arlen Cox's home.

16:07.809 --> 16:10.344
If you're here to take me up
on my offer,

16:10.378 --> 16:11.912
you're gonna have to change that suit.

16:11.946 --> 16:14.081
No, unfortunately,
I'm on the clock, Doctor.

16:14.115 --> 16:15.716
Please, it's George.

16:15.750 --> 16:17.451
That's your given name?

16:17.485 --> 16:19.805
If I had changed my name, I'd
have picked something flashy.

16:21.389 --> 16:23.200
What's your involvement
with the police department?

16:23.224 --> 16:25.158
My involvement?

16:27.495 --> 16:30.931
I'm sorry, am I being
investigated for something?

16:30.965 --> 16:32.599
What does A.D. Koppell stand for?

16:33.968 --> 16:35.546
Isn't that some sort
of nickname of yours?

16:35.570 --> 16:36.970
I think I know my own nickname.

16:37.005 --> 16:39.206
Are you familiar with
the Joey Campbell case?

16:39.240 --> 16:40.774
Of course.

16:40.808 --> 16:42.577
Were you anywhere near
the Houses August 29,

16:42.602 --> 16:44.321
- the night he was murdered?
- Absolutely not.

16:44.345 --> 16:46.962
- You're sure about that?
- I'm sure.

16:47.682 --> 16:48.949
Are we done?

16:51.352 --> 16:52.786
I'll keep in touch.

16:58.960 --> 17:00.093
Mr. Terry.

17:09.936 --> 17:11.838
Mr. Terry, thank you for coming down.

17:11.873 --> 17:13.040
Governor.

17:13.074 --> 17:15.275
Please, sit.

17:15.310 --> 17:17.759
Mr. Terry, I'm concerned
your attention has been divided.

17:17.784 --> 17:19.768
I understand your concern, Governor.

17:19.869 --> 17:20.914
But if I had any doubt

17:20.948 --> 17:23.227
that the Joey Campbell case
was connected to Jesse Carr's,

17:23.251 --> 17:24.928
I would have never brought it
to Washington's attention.

17:24.952 --> 17:27.587
Listen, I sat down
with the boy's mother.

17:27.622 --> 17:30.457
I was in his room, for God sakes.

17:30.491 --> 17:31.892
It's a tragedy.

17:31.926 --> 17:33.860
But how is it a DOJ case?

17:33.895 --> 17:35.372
We're investigating potential corruption

17:35.396 --> 17:37.643
within the Gate Station
Sheriff's Office.

17:39.934 --> 17:42.969
And how is my friend Dr. Koppell
involved in any of this?

17:43.004 --> 17:44.604
We're still investigating, Governor.

17:44.639 --> 17:47.307
You're still here because
I told Deputy Chief Carroll

17:47.342 --> 17:49.276
I had confidence in you.

17:49.310 --> 17:50.644
You realize the moment

17:50.678 --> 17:52.713
these questionable leads of
yours dry up,

17:52.747 --> 17:54.147
I can no longer say that.

17:54.182 --> 17:57.751
I also realize that if I fail,
Joey Campbell's killer roams free.

17:58.853 --> 18:00.887
But I don't see that happening.

18:11.216 --> 18:12.927
- Hey.
- Hey.

18:13.654 --> 18:17.232
Dr. George Koppell is one of
Eamons' most generous supporters.

18:17.257 --> 18:18.772
Getting summoned
to the Governor's Mansion

18:18.796 --> 18:20.760
only adds to my suspicion of the guy.

18:20.794 --> 18:22.528
What sent you to Koppell
in the first place?

18:22.563 --> 18:24.664
Well, his name didn't ring
a bell at first

18:24.698 --> 18:27.233
till I saw it on the governor's
campaign donors list.

18:27.267 --> 18:28.868
Wait a second.

18:28.902 --> 18:30.603
You saw this list where?

18:30.637 --> 18:32.506
Look, it doesn't matter.
I rattled the guy enough

18:32.530 --> 18:34.083
for him to call the governor in a panic.

18:34.107 --> 18:35.875
There's a reason for that.

18:37.110 --> 18:38.544
Are you sure?

18:38.579 --> 18:39.745
Yeah.

18:39.780 --> 18:43.849
I mean, it was dark,
but it ain't this dude.

18:43.884 --> 18:45.918
Dude who shot Joey looked different.

18:45.953 --> 18:49.101
- Different how?
- Don't know.

18:50.344 --> 18:52.921
Does this man look familiar?

18:54.344 --> 18:56.445
Yeah, I've seen him around.

18:56.480 --> 18:57.724
He used to work the neighborhood.

18:57.748 --> 18:59.582
Was he there when Joey was killed?

18:59.616 --> 19:01.250
Told you, I didn't see the cops' faces.

19:01.284 --> 19:03.586
People are saying you're
the wrong kind of witness.

19:03.620 --> 19:04.720
Are they right?

19:04.755 --> 19:05.932
Now, what the hell you mean by that?

19:05.956 --> 19:06.996
He told you what he knows.

19:08.458 --> 19:11.093
And you stand by this rendering
of the shooter?

19:11.128 --> 19:13.896
Yeah. I mean, it was dark, like I say.

19:13.930 --> 19:15.231
And that was a month ago.

19:15.265 --> 19:16.699
And I barely remember you.

19:16.733 --> 19:19.301
You don't forget the face
of a man who murdered a boy

19:19.336 --> 19:20.903
crying for his mother.

19:26.610 --> 19:28.944
I'm sure, 100%.

19:28.979 --> 19:31.213
Not him.

19:31.248 --> 19:32.548
Give the kid a break.

19:32.582 --> 19:34.483
Composite sketches aren't foolproof.

19:34.518 --> 19:37.787
When this much time has passed,
a person's imagination can trump memory.

19:37.821 --> 19:39.766
We can't give Washington time
to have second thoughts.

19:39.790 --> 19:42.058
You back to trying to impress them?

19:42.092 --> 19:43.603
It's not about me. It's about the case

19:43.627 --> 19:45.227
and making sure they don't shut it down.

19:45.262 --> 19:46.839
You mean, now that the governor
is no longer

19:46.863 --> 19:48.164
in the Preston Terry fan club?

19:49.966 --> 19:51.678
So what, you don't think I
should have talked to Koppell

19:51.702 --> 19:52.668
because he's friends with Eamons?

19:52.703 --> 19:54.470
I never said that.

19:57.040 --> 19:58.274
Akino.

19:59.643 --> 20:00.910
Got it.

20:00.944 --> 20:03.179
Text me the address.

20:03.213 --> 20:06.015
Sergeant Derkin registered
firearms in Mason County,

20:06.049 --> 20:07.450
a couple of hours out of town.

20:07.484 --> 20:08.695
They have one police station there.

20:08.719 --> 20:10.096
I'm gonna see if I can track him down.

20:10.120 --> 20:11.821
What's the address? I'll meet you there.

20:11.855 --> 20:13.289
It's a solo trip.

20:13.323 --> 20:15.291
Why? Because I talked to Koppell alone?

20:15.325 --> 20:17.993
Doctors and lawyers speak
one language, cops another.

20:18.028 --> 20:21.530
They don't move cops around for nothing.

20:21.565 --> 20:23.099
This path you got us on is something.

20:23.133 --> 20:24.133
Good work.

20:24.167 --> 20:26.535
I'm sorry, what was that?

20:26.570 --> 20:28.471
Don't be a smart-ass.

20:31.475 --> 20:32.908
Come in.

20:34.544 --> 20:36.112
Little late for lunch, isn't it?

20:36.146 --> 20:37.179
Dinner.

20:37.214 --> 20:39.949
Wife had me bring it over.

20:39.983 --> 20:42.284
Doreen called her.

20:42.319 --> 20:44.653
Said y'all were having issues.

20:44.688 --> 20:46.822
That's putting it mildly.

20:46.857 --> 20:48.224
She packed up and moved out.

20:50.227 --> 20:52.895
Just want to say we're here,

20:52.929 --> 20:53.963
me and Sandra.

20:53.997 --> 20:55.097
Whatever you need.

20:55.132 --> 20:56.165
I appreciate it.

20:57.534 --> 21:00.039
You know I got an anniversary coming up?

21:00.141 --> 21:01.470
Yes, I do.

21:01.505 --> 21:03.305
20 years on the force, Calvert.

21:03.340 --> 21:05.841
I'm going to reserve my congratulations

21:05.876 --> 21:07.076
until it's official.

21:11.882 --> 21:15.584
You know, with all this noise going on,

21:15.619 --> 21:17.019
now you and Doreen,

21:17.053 --> 21:19.989
if you could've done
anything differently,

21:20.023 --> 21:23.492
after all your years
on the force, would you?

21:26.663 --> 21:29.365
Being a sheriff is a business of crisis.

21:29.399 --> 21:32.301
But it's the life I chose.

21:32.335 --> 21:36.071
It's the life that Doreen
chose when she made her vows.

21:37.841 --> 21:39.175
I regret hurting her.

21:41.011 --> 21:45.214
But would I have done
anything different?

21:45.248 --> 21:46.315
Hell no.

21:49.168 --> 21:51.803
And the air has been
so thick in this town that...

21:53.241 --> 21:56.586
I haven't been able to be
what I needed to be with her.

21:56.619 --> 21:58.428
- I just...
- Yeah.

22:00.964 --> 22:03.365
It's getting hard as hell to breathe.

22:17.347 --> 22:19.014
Sergeant Derkin?

22:19.049 --> 22:20.482
Yeah.

22:20.517 --> 22:21.517
Ashe Akino.

22:21.551 --> 22:23.986
Investigator with the DOJ.

22:24.564 --> 22:27.022
- You don't look happy to see me.
- Does anyone?

22:27.057 --> 22:28.357
- Depends.
- On?

22:28.391 --> 22:29.391
Which side they're on.

22:30.994 --> 22:32.294
You're a long way from home.

22:32.329 --> 22:33.973
What did you do to get
transferred out here?

22:33.997 --> 22:35.174
Cops are transferred all the time.

22:35.198 --> 22:36.999
Yeah, maybe.

22:38.468 --> 22:41.871
You patrolled the Houses
with Lieutenant Breeland.

22:41.905 --> 22:44.206
You see anything the night
Joey Campbell was killed?

22:44.241 --> 22:46.452
It was Breeland's crime scene,
you must've talked to him.

22:46.476 --> 22:48.544
So, you were there?

22:48.578 --> 22:51.180
But you weren't listed
on Breeland's report.

22:51.214 --> 22:52.448
Any idea why?

22:52.482 --> 22:54.783
- Why don't you ask him?
- Stop playing with me.

22:54.818 --> 22:57.753
There were two cops on
the scene when Joey was shot,

22:57.787 --> 23:00.673
and you must've really messed up
to get sent to this hell-hole.

23:00.698 --> 23:02.458
I requested this transfer.

23:02.492 --> 23:04.226
You chose to come out here,

23:04.886 --> 23:07.050
to leave your squad, your family?

23:07.354 --> 23:09.031
I got no family.

23:11.001 --> 23:13.102
Did A.D. Koppell have anything to do

23:13.136 --> 23:14.904
with you high-tailing it
out of Gate Station?

23:16.339 --> 23:18.140
You don't even know
what that means, do you?

23:24.481 --> 23:26.749
The governor's got a lot
of rich donor friends,

23:26.783 --> 23:32.187
but Koppell, he wasn't the
auxiliary deputy on that night.

23:32.222 --> 23:34.690
So who was?

23:34.724 --> 23:35.658
Break's over.

23:35.692 --> 23:37.408
If you change your mind...

23:37.517 --> 23:41.135
Or if you just need to talk.

23:48.282 --> 23:51.001
Preston, I need you
to go through the police reports

23:51.026 --> 23:53.676
and flag any name with "A.D." attached.

23:53.710 --> 23:55.577
A.D. isn't any one person's initials.

23:55.612 --> 23:58.647
It's an abbreviation
for auxiliary deputy.

23:59.749 --> 24:01.809
Thank you! Thank you!

24:03.591 --> 24:06.050
Hold on, hold on.
Look, political correctness

24:06.074 --> 24:07.894
is killing this country, okay?

24:07.928 --> 24:10.830
We've all heard the governor's
supporters hollering,

24:10.865 --> 24:12.098
"What about Joey?"

24:12.133 --> 24:13.733
You know what I want
to ask the governor?

24:14.702 --> 24:18.738
I want to ask your governor
why the cop that killed Jesse Carr

24:18.773 --> 24:20.807
is still walking around free.

24:20.841 --> 24:22.823
What about Jesse?!

24:22.847 --> 24:23.977
What about Jesse?!

24:24.002 --> 24:26.565
What about Jesse? What about Jesse?

24:28.377 --> 24:30.323
- What about Jesse?
- Yeah!

24:30.449 --> 24:32.417
- Let Moder talk!
- Go home!

24:32.544 --> 24:34.345
- You got no business here!
- Let Moder talk!

24:34.388 --> 24:37.657
How many of y'all consider
yourselves pro-life?

24:39.527 --> 24:40.794
If you're pro-life,

24:40.828 --> 24:45.965
how can you not respect the life
of a murdered child?

24:46.000 --> 24:48.802
Any child?

24:48.836 --> 24:54.140
You can't chant "What about Jesse?"
and not care about Joey.

24:56.010 --> 24:58.611
And if you're chanting
"What about Joey,"

24:58.646 --> 25:01.634
I want to hear you say
Jesse's name, too!

25:02.650 --> 25:06.953
We live in a city that is
separated by tracks,

25:06.987 --> 25:11.057
and further divided by race and class.

25:11.092 --> 25:13.963
And turning our anger on each
other won't change anything!

25:13.988 --> 25:16.429
It'll just further divide us.

25:16.535 --> 25:19.265
So let's take this moment

25:19.394 --> 25:22.001
to truly be pro-life.

25:26.184 --> 25:28.184
What about Joey?

25:28.283 --> 25:31.111
Get outta here! What about Joey?

25:31.145 --> 25:33.580
Tensions escalated
this afternoon when protestors

25:33.614 --> 25:36.516
supporting Joey Campbell
clashed with attendees

25:36.550 --> 25:39.619
at a Penn Moder gubernatorial
campaign rally.

25:39.653 --> 25:41.688
Pastor Janae Jones surprised the crowd

25:41.722 --> 25:45.692
by taking the microphone,
causing emotions to flare...

26:54.995 --> 26:56.029
I can't.

27:07.174 --> 27:10.910
And I didn't even have to ask.

27:12.012 --> 27:14.113
Come on, Ma, this is important.

27:14.148 --> 27:15.982
What you working on?

27:16.016 --> 27:17.283
Short story I got to read

27:17.318 --> 27:18.795
in front of the whole class tomorrow.

27:18.819 --> 27:20.964
The teacher was cool with me
writing about Emmett Till,

27:20.988 --> 27:22.989
even though none
of the kids ever heard of him.

27:23.023 --> 27:24.390
Don't go doubting yourself.

27:24.425 --> 27:26.092
You'll be teaching them something.

27:27.595 --> 27:30.730
Took guts, facing them people
at that new school.

27:30.764 --> 27:31.965
I'm proud of you.

27:40.641 --> 27:43.109
I apologize for not reaching out sooner.

27:44.678 --> 27:47.814
Why didn't you tell me
the Cox Group, Financial

27:47.848 --> 27:50.516
was financing your education initiative?

27:50.551 --> 27:52.218
We need prisons.

27:52.253 --> 27:55.421
That's our reality, and our
state prisons are overcrowded.

27:55.456 --> 27:57.123
Overcrowded with my people.

27:57.157 --> 27:59.058
I'm trying to change that.

27:59.093 --> 28:01.594
My education initiative
is the first step

28:01.629 --> 28:03.062
in breaking that cycle.

28:03.097 --> 28:04.264
You cannot dismiss that.

28:04.298 --> 28:06.532
I'm not dismissing it.

28:06.567 --> 28:09.202
I just don't want my name
attached to it.

28:09.236 --> 28:13.374
I know how these
private prisons operate,

28:13.624 --> 28:17.522
trading prisoners like-like Lincoln
never made his proclamation.

28:17.608 --> 28:19.008
Do you want me to refuse the money,

28:19.241 --> 28:21.080
just wash my hands of these children?

28:21.115 --> 28:24.250
- That is not what I'm saying.
- Well, you're in the room now.

28:24.285 --> 28:27.905
You have to do more than just
spout ideology. You need a plan.

28:27.930 --> 28:29.455
My plan is to be heard.

28:29.490 --> 28:33.092
These protests will not stop
the prison from being built.

28:33.127 --> 28:35.279
If anything, they're just
endangering this initiative.

28:35.304 --> 28:37.764
The fact that it's funding
poor black schools

28:37.798 --> 28:39.299
is a slap in the face.

28:39.333 --> 28:42.296
You make deals
in order to make progress.

28:42.321 --> 28:45.104
That's the difference
between you and me.

28:45.139 --> 28:48.508
What you see as progress,
I see as compromise.

28:48.542 --> 28:51.678
Compromise is how you get
things done. That's politics.

28:51.712 --> 28:55.615
Politicians make rules
and set boundaries.

28:55.649 --> 28:57.717
Leaders are visionaries
who know no boundaries.

28:57.742 --> 29:01.754
Janae, I know how much
Gate Station means to you.

29:02.607 --> 29:06.074
Together, we can get
ahead of this and keep our city

29:06.099 --> 29:08.310
from becoming another Ferguson.

29:10.664 --> 29:13.291
Ferguson was a tragedy,

29:13.567 --> 29:15.836
a rallying cry that spawned a movement.

29:15.861 --> 29:18.596
A movement still alive today.

29:19.556 --> 29:23.176
Have you ever considered that
maybe I do want another Ferguson?

29:25.112 --> 29:27.780
Well, I guess that's the
difference between you and me.

29:32.753 --> 29:34.354
Good luck to you.

29:44.631 --> 29:47.166
What do you got?

29:47.201 --> 29:49.936
I dug through the reports
and found another I.D.

29:49.970 --> 29:51.838
Turns out this guy Christopher McFarland

29:51.872 --> 29:54.340
is not only an auxiliary deputy
for the Sheriff's Department,

29:54.375 --> 29:56.943
he's also one of
Governor Eamons' top donors.

29:56.977 --> 29:59.178
60 years old, fits Cory's
description of the shooter,

29:59.213 --> 30:01.714
and he owns this whole damn building.

30:05.119 --> 30:07.248
What's going on?

30:07.881 --> 30:10.786
I need to head back to D.C.
Personal matter.

30:11.694 --> 30:14.475
Carroll said he'd give me
the time off, if you're down.

30:14.998 --> 30:17.069
You think you can handle
everything here without me

30:17.094 --> 30:18.172
for a couple days, boss?

30:18.633 --> 30:20.180
You okay?

30:21.572 --> 30:23.698
I said it was personal.

30:24.041 --> 30:26.509
I think we both want to keep
our personal lives to ourselves.

30:26.543 --> 30:28.244
Got it.

30:36.320 --> 30:37.753
What do you think you're doing?

30:37.788 --> 30:39.755
About to have a conversation.

30:39.790 --> 30:40.957
The hell you are.

30:40.991 --> 30:42.592
You're harassing
members of my community,

30:42.626 --> 30:43.724
and you have no right.

30:43.749 --> 30:45.787
We have every right to question
potential suspects

30:45.812 --> 30:47.034
in a murder investigation.

30:47.059 --> 30:49.031
Not while destroying
everything in your path.

30:49.066 --> 30:51.934
You are guests in my house.

30:51.969 --> 30:54.170
These are my people, you understand me?

30:54.204 --> 30:55.738
If your people were doing their jobs,

30:55.772 --> 30:58.207
we wouldn't be here doing ours.

30:58.242 --> 31:00.676
You ready to do your job, Sheriff?

31:00.711 --> 31:03.079
You can start by explaining
why A.D. Koppell

31:03.113 --> 31:04.714
and A.D. McFarland were listed

31:04.748 --> 31:07.083
on multiple police reports
in the Houses.

31:07.117 --> 31:08.885
Are these ride-alongs?

31:08.919 --> 31:13.422
Those men are among a handful
of volunteer auxiliary deputies,

31:13.457 --> 31:15.191
professionally trained, duly sworn,

31:15.225 --> 31:18.027
law enforcement personnel.

31:18.061 --> 31:20.730
A handful? How many is that?

31:20.764 --> 31:22.918
- Four.
- How many 60-year-old men

31:22.943 --> 31:25.535
are you hiring down at the department
to patrol high crime areas?

31:25.569 --> 31:28.004
These men are trained civilian deputies

31:28.038 --> 31:29.872
who want to make the world
a better place.

31:29.907 --> 31:32.608
By cleaning the streets
one black man at a time?

31:32.643 --> 31:34.243
Boy...

31:34.278 --> 31:36.746
What comes with these
deputy certifications?

31:36.780 --> 31:39.782
A gun, a badge,
and a VIP tour of the Houses?

31:47.057 --> 31:51.227
Your department is running
tours of the Houses.

31:52.496 --> 31:55.665
Taking the governor's rich white friends

31:55.699 --> 31:58.568
to poor black neighborhoods
like they're on safari.

31:58.602 --> 32:00.703
That is not what this is.

32:00.737 --> 32:02.638
This is an above-board program.

32:02.673 --> 32:05.308
All this time we've been looking
at these other people,

32:05.342 --> 32:07.410
but we should have been looking at you.

32:07.444 --> 32:09.897
You look all you want.

32:09.924 --> 32:11.424
I'm not going anywhere.

32:17.315 --> 32:20.199
Now we know why Breeland
was so tight on Beck.

32:20.928 --> 32:22.195
The tours.

32:22.324 --> 32:24.418
You think the pressure got to him?

32:25.299 --> 32:27.544
Knowing his own people
were being hunted?

32:28.263 --> 32:30.036
By the time he pulls Jesse over,

32:30.071 --> 32:33.247
he's off, paranoid and boom.

32:33.407 --> 32:35.504
Another dead kid, but he knows this case

32:35.529 --> 32:38.311
isn't just gonna disappear
like Joey's. He's panicked.

32:38.346 --> 32:39.779
Breeland shows up.

32:39.814 --> 32:41.214
Breeland.

32:41.249 --> 32:43.081
He's our dead end in both cases.

32:43.100 --> 32:45.769
We got to get him to snitch on Beck.

32:45.803 --> 32:48.071
Or we get Beck to turn on
Breeland about the tours.

32:48.105 --> 32:49.539
Or Sergeant Derkin.

32:49.574 --> 32:53.171
That guy's got a lot of guilt,
more than he can carry.

32:53.377 --> 32:54.878
I think I can turn him.

32:56.881 --> 32:58.315
On the upside,

32:58.349 --> 33:02.118
we got a roster of old
white dudes to show Cory.

33:02.153 --> 33:04.154
Hell of a lot more
than we did yesterday.

33:06.691 --> 33:09.226
This whole thing about the tours.

33:09.260 --> 33:11.228
I can't wrap my head around it.

33:11.262 --> 33:13.797
Wish I could say I was surprised.

33:13.831 --> 33:15.832
How could you not be?

33:15.867 --> 33:19.302
People think that we're inherently good,

33:19.337 --> 33:24.374
because it makes them feel like
there's a reason for all this,

33:24.408 --> 33:28.545
but when you do what I do,

33:28.579 --> 33:30.057
you realize that people got it wrong.

33:30.081 --> 33:33.583
We're born bad.

33:33.618 --> 33:35.218
We're just taught to be good.

33:35.253 --> 33:38.088
You don't believe that.

33:38.122 --> 33:39.890
What about your daughter?

33:40.156 --> 33:42.062
Kai?

33:44.453 --> 33:47.273
She's my heartbeat.

33:49.100 --> 33:52.135
She's the only good thing in my life.

34:05.683 --> 34:08.118
I'm going back to D.C.
for a custody hearing.

34:08.152 --> 34:09.886
That's why I needed time off.

34:12.255 --> 34:15.659
I could lose my daughter,
and if I do, it's my own damn fault.

34:17.061 --> 34:19.696
Look, I know you believe in karma

34:19.730 --> 34:21.842
and you're worried this whole
thing is gonna come knocking,

34:21.866 --> 34:23.166
but that's not how life works.

34:23.199 --> 34:25.068
Not your life.

34:26.036 --> 34:29.272
No matter how hard you try and hide it,
I see the good in you.

34:35.212 --> 34:37.714
So what's up with, with you and Sarah?

34:39.684 --> 34:41.251
Decided to settle for your Hillary?

34:41.284 --> 34:42.518
What?

34:42.553 --> 34:44.454
You know, instead of waiting
for your Michelle.

34:47.757 --> 34:49.993
None of my business, but, you know,

34:50.027 --> 34:52.862
dating the governor's aide,
not a good look.

34:52.897 --> 34:54.630
You know, for your career.

34:54.665 --> 34:58.234
We have a suspect to I.D.
I'll see you back at Cory's.

34:59.236 --> 35:00.303
And for the record,

35:01.062 --> 35:03.974
hooking up with my brother
wasn't a real pretty look, either.

35:38.032 --> 35:40.543
You mind shining that light
a little to the left?

35:40.578 --> 35:42.312
You missed a yield sign back there.

35:42.346 --> 35:43.824
You had anything
to drink tonight, ma'am?

35:43.848 --> 35:45.081
I had one beer.

35:45.116 --> 35:46.850
No law against that last time I checked.

35:46.884 --> 35:48.528
Well, I'm gonna have to
administer a field sobriety

35:48.552 --> 35:51.750
test, so why don't you
step out of the vehicle?

35:51.956 --> 35:53.242
How about this...

35:53.267 --> 35:55.959
you give me a Breathalyzer
and we'll both be on our way.

35:55.993 --> 35:57.460
Out of the car, ma'am.

35:58.446 --> 36:01.471
You have my credentials, you
know I'm an officer of the law.

36:01.496 --> 36:03.473
I don't give a damn who you are.

36:03.501 --> 36:05.612
Get out of the car, or I'm
going to light your ass up!

36:05.636 --> 36:07.971
You can't talk to me like that!
Give me your badge number.

36:08.005 --> 36:09.339
Out of the car!

36:09.373 --> 36:10.940
Out of the car!

36:10.975 --> 36:12.208
Get your hands off me!

36:12.253 --> 36:13.739
Get your ass on the ground, now!

36:13.764 --> 36:15.786
On the ground! On the ground!

36:17.081 --> 36:19.783
All the way down,
get your ass all the way down.

36:19.817 --> 36:21.418
Now!

36:38.002 --> 36:39.736
Let's go, get up.

36:39.770 --> 36:41.438
Let's go.

36:43.407 --> 36:45.675
Up against the car and stay.

36:51.549 --> 36:53.950
Just relax and there won't be a problem.

37:12.069 --> 37:15.038
Deputy, her weapon.

37:19.510 --> 37:20.877
I'll take it from here.

37:20.911 --> 37:22.479
Yes, sir.

37:43.768 --> 37:48.204
I will do my best to keep
this incident out of the system.

38:08.959 --> 38:11.361
Refusing a sobriety test,

38:11.395 --> 38:13.763
assaulting an officer,

38:13.798 --> 38:15.365
resisting arrest

38:15.399 --> 38:17.700
certainly won't get you
your daughter back.

38:21.705 --> 38:24.641
Kai, that's her name, right?

38:54.596 --> 38:56.206
You're still up?

38:56.232 --> 38:58.710
You know you're getting on that
bus at the crack of dawn, right?

38:58.734 --> 39:00.268
Yeah, I know.

39:00.452 --> 39:03.388
I finished my story, but I
don't think it's good enough.

39:03.422 --> 39:05.123
Come on, I'll take a listen.

39:11.630 --> 39:13.298
What you got?

39:15.768 --> 39:18.102
"Over the 60 earthly years
I've been in Heaven

39:18.137 --> 39:19.604
"I've bunked with a lot of people,

39:19.638 --> 39:22.373
and today I'm getting a new roommate."

39:22.408 --> 39:24.375
They got roommates up in Heaven?

39:24.410 --> 39:26.144
That don't sound fair to me.

39:29.748 --> 39:32.750
"When I was 14, I visited
my uncle in Mississippi,"

39:32.785 --> 39:34.252
"where I whistled at a white girl"

39:34.286 --> 39:36.254
"at the counter of a candy shop..."

39:36.288 --> 39:38.122
"My new roommate interrupts."

39:38.197 --> 39:40.481
"Confused, he asks,
'Why would you do that?'"

39:41.026 --> 39:44.528
"So I said, 'I grew up
in Chicago, Trayvon,"

39:44.964 --> 39:48.051
"'where whistling at a pretty girl
didn't come with a death sentence.'"

39:49.869 --> 39:51.669
"A few days later,

39:51.704 --> 39:54.122
"two white men dragged me
out of my uncle's house

39:54.147 --> 39:55.747
"and threw me in the back
of their truck,

39:55.776 --> 39:57.755
"where a black man was waiting.

39:58.778 --> 40:01.446
"At first I was relieved.

40:01.661 --> 40:05.250
Then I saw him laughing,
and I knew it wasn't good."

40:14.727 --> 40:17.862
"The black man held me down
while the white men tortured me,

40:17.897 --> 40:22.066
"and after my soul left my body,
I watched them shoot me,

40:22.101 --> 40:23.802
"tie me to a cotton-gin fan,

40:23.836 --> 40:25.436
and throw me in the Tallahatchie River."

40:41.553 --> 40:43.732
"Over the years there were times
when I thought the sadness

40:43.756 --> 40:46.324
"would never leave, but it did...

40:46.667 --> 40:48.193
eventually."

40:56.435 --> 40:58.073
"And here I am now,"

40:58.269 --> 41:00.549
"hoping I can help the sadness leave you."

41:01.073 --> 41:03.073
"Trayvon wasn't sure the sadness
would ever leave,"

41:03.354 --> 41:05.901
"and he asked me about justice."

41:06.111 --> 41:08.639
"So I told him what God told me:."

41:09.311 --> 41:13.053
"Those who have harmed you will answer
for their sins in the afterlife."

41:13.514 --> 41:15.019
"Suddenly, there's a knock"

41:15.054 --> 41:16.531
"on the door of the Heavenly
home I share"

41:16.555 --> 41:19.123
"with Trayvon Martin
and a new face enters,"

41:19.218 --> 41:21.546
"one unfamiliar to the both of us."

41:21.772 --> 41:23.851
"'Who are you?' Trayvon asks."

41:24.730 --> 41:26.530
"The boy answers,"

41:28.334 --> 41:32.437
"'Joey. Joey Campbell.'"

42:01.033 --> 42:04.269
Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey!

42:04.303 --> 42:08.072
Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey!

42:08.107 --> 42:11.476
Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey!

42:23.122 --> 42:25.423
That's him.

42:25.457 --> 42:26.658
That's the man who shot Joey.
