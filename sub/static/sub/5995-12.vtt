00:01.000 --> 00:02.703
Previously on
Crazy Ex-Girlfriend...

00:02.735 --> 00:04.072
Just wanted to be
a little less lonely,

00:04.105 --> 00:05.239
make some friends.
Well,

00:05.273 --> 00:06.307
you made one.

00:06.340 --> 00:07.308
(smooches)

00:07.341 --> 00:09.177
Later, bro.

00:09.210 --> 00:12.213
Someone broke
into your apartment?

00:12.246 --> 00:13.281
Throw the rock
through the window!

00:13.314 --> 00:14.315
(Scott screams)

00:16.517 --> 00:17.285
Why don't we go back
to your place,

00:17.318 --> 00:19.087
and I'll make sure
it's all okay.

00:19.120 --> 00:20.154
This is your rock?
There's got to be

00:20.188 --> 00:21.655
another explanation...

00:21.689 --> 00:23.191
Wait, wait, wait,
please-please don't explain.

00:23.224 --> 00:24.492
Uh, I got to go.

00:24.525 --> 00:26.660
Moments ago he held me
in his arms,

00:26.694 --> 00:29.430
and then just now he could
barely look me in the eye.

00:29.463 --> 00:30.664
All of my dreams

00:30.698 --> 00:32.833
may have just been shattered.

00:32.866 --> 00:35.769
* I was working hard
at a New York job *

00:35.803 --> 00:37.505
* Making dough
but it made me blue *

00:37.538 --> 00:39.107
* One day I was crying a lot

00:39.140 --> 00:40.374
* And so I decided to move

00:40.408 --> 00:42.276
* To West Covina, California

00:42.310 --> 00:43.211
* Brand-new pals
and new career *

00:43.244 --> 00:45.379
* It happens to be
where Josh lives *

00:45.413 --> 00:47.781
* But that's not why I'm here

00:47.815 --> 00:50.351
* She's the crazy
 ex-girlfriend *
What? No, I'm not.

00:50.384 --> 00:52.186
* She's the crazy
 ex-girlfriend *

00:52.220 --> 00:53.187
That's a sexist term.

00:53.221 --> 00:54.188
* She's the crazy
 ex-girlfriend *

00:54.222 --> 00:55.856
Can you guys stop singing
for just a second?

00:55.889 --> 00:58.426
* She's so broken inside *

00:58.459 --> 01:00.128
The situation's a lot more
nuanced than that.

01:00.161 --> 01:02.196
* C-R-A-Z-Y *

01:02.230 --> 01:03.431
Okay! We get it!

01:03.464 --> 01:05.533
* Crazy ex-girlfriend. *

01:07.301 --> 01:09.303
REBECCA: He hasn't called.
 He hasn't texted.

01:09.337 --> 01:10.271
He hasn't Snapchatted.
He hasn't Vibered.

01:10.304 --> 01:12.206
He hasn't Facebook
messaged me.

01:12.240 --> 01:13.541
He hasn't liked any of my
Instagram posts, including...

01:13.574 --> 01:15.209
the other day

01:15.243 --> 01:17.311
I posted a picture of a baby...

01:17.345 --> 01:18.646
penguin...

01:18.679 --> 01:19.680
surfing.

01:19.713 --> 01:20.881
Look, I know it's been tough...

01:20.914 --> 01:22.316
No, no, no, Paula.

01:22.350 --> 01:23.817
With all due respect,

01:23.851 --> 01:25.353
you did not see his face

01:25.386 --> 01:27.821
when he left my apartment
that day.

01:27.855 --> 01:30.158
I was dead to him, like,
he didn't want to spend

01:30.191 --> 01:32.860
any more time with me, and, oh,
we were getting so close.

01:32.893 --> 01:34.395
You know?
And you will again.

01:34.428 --> 01:36.297
I promise you,
I'm gonna fix this.

01:36.330 --> 01:37.698
By the end of day

01:37.731 --> 01:39.267
tomorrow,
Josh will have asked

01:39.300 --> 01:40.301
you out to dinner.

01:40.334 --> 01:41.302
What?

01:41.335 --> 01:42.303
What, tomorrow?

01:42.336 --> 01:43.537
Dinner?

01:43.571 --> 01:45.339
What are you...
that's impossible.

01:45.373 --> 01:46.374
Impossible?

01:46.407 --> 01:48.476
Rebecca,
we put a man on the moon.

01:48.509 --> 01:50.178
"We"? Did you have something
to do with that?

01:50.211 --> 01:51.479
No, not at all,

01:51.512 --> 01:53.714
but I have been watching
 Apollo 13 a lot.

01:53.747 --> 01:55.216
I got the Blu-ray

01:55.249 --> 01:56.417
at a garage sale, and oh, my...

01:56.450 --> 01:58.486
(sighs) Ed Harris.

01:58.519 --> 02:00.588
Ed Ha... do you-do you remember,
with the glasses?

02:00.621 --> 02:02.890
I mean, come on, he... he
brought those Americans home,

02:02.923 --> 02:06.427
just like I'm gonna bring
that buff Filipino bro home

02:06.460 --> 02:07.928
to... you.

02:07.961 --> 02:09.396
Like Ed says,

02:09.430 --> 02:12.400
"Failure is not an option."

02:12.433 --> 02:15.736
I have no idea what you're
talking about right now,

02:15.769 --> 02:17.271
but you seem really confident,

02:17.305 --> 02:19.307
and you're talking
about space, so...

02:19.340 --> 02:20.641
I'm gonna go with your plan.

02:20.674 --> 02:21.909
What's the first step?

02:22.943 --> 02:24.612
Smog check.

02:24.645 --> 02:26.314
(pneumatic tools whirring)

02:26.347 --> 02:27.915
PAULA: Go to the auto body shop
 on East Cameron

02:27.948 --> 02:30.318
at exactly 2:00 p.m. tomorrow.

02:30.351 --> 02:32.320
Do precisely
 what I tell you to do,

02:32.353 --> 02:34.422
and most of all...

02:34.455 --> 02:35.789
stay relaxed.

02:35.823 --> 02:37.291
I am relaxed.

02:37.325 --> 02:39.193
I have soupy bones.

02:40.628 --> 02:42.430
Hey.

02:42.463 --> 02:43.431
Oh.

02:43.464 --> 02:44.832
Hey, dude, good to see you.

02:44.865 --> 02:47.335
Rebecca, uh, what are you...

02:47.368 --> 02:48.836
Uh, just getting
an old smog check.

02:48.869 --> 02:51.239
Don't you have a brand-new car?

02:51.272 --> 02:52.105
You're always talking about it,

02:52.139 --> 02:54.408
listing all the features
of your Hyundai

02:54.442 --> 02:55.843
as if you were
in a commercial or something.

02:55.876 --> 02:57.611
(laughs)
Uh, what happened to your car?

02:57.645 --> 02:59.247
Uh, it got dinged.

02:59.280 --> 03:01.549
PAULA:
 Step two,

03:01.582 --> 03:03.351
apologize quickly.
REBECCA: Hey, Josh...

03:03.384 --> 03:05.453
I'm super sorry for, like,

03:05.486 --> 03:07.421
misunderstanding
a couple weeks ago.

03:07.455 --> 03:08.922
PAULA:
 And step three...

03:08.956 --> 03:10.891
move on to the someone
you're seeing.

03:10.924 --> 03:12.593
Yeah, the whole thing's
so embarrassing.

03:12.626 --> 03:14.395
I was telling Trent
about it recently...

03:14.428 --> 03:15.663
Who's Trent?
Oh.

03:15.696 --> 03:17.598
I'm sorry, you don't know Trent.
Trent's the new guy I'm seeing.

03:17.631 --> 03:20.434
Oh, you're, uh, seeing someone?

03:20.468 --> 03:21.869
Yeah, yeah, I knew him
back in college.

03:21.902 --> 03:22.903
He went to Harvard?

03:22.936 --> 03:25.306
Yes, indeed,
Ye olde Harvard.

03:25.339 --> 03:26.740
PAULA:
 Fake boyfriend from Harvard.

03:26.774 --> 03:28.509
All we need is
some random guy

03:28.542 --> 03:29.810
who went to Harvard
at the same time you did,

03:29.843 --> 03:31.545
and lives in Los Angeles.

03:31.579 --> 03:33.747
Ooh, what about this guy?
Trent.

03:33.781 --> 03:35.616
Oh, that's a perfect name
for a fake boyfriend.

03:35.649 --> 03:38.319
Huh. That's awesome
you met someone.

03:38.352 --> 03:40.254
Yeah, we're really happy.

03:40.288 --> 03:42.556
Miss Bunch,
you are all set.

03:42.590 --> 03:43.591
Oh, thank you.

03:43.624 --> 03:44.825
Oh, here you go.

03:44.858 --> 03:46.294
There you are.

03:46.327 --> 03:47.461
PAULA:
 And then you close

03:47.495 --> 03:48.829
with a coupon.

03:48.862 --> 03:50.798
Uh, ma'am,
we don't take coupons.

03:50.831 --> 03:52.633
Oh, I'm sorry,
I have that in my wallet.

03:52.666 --> 03:53.667
I've been meaning to use it.

03:53.701 --> 03:55.002
It's a coupon for free drinks

03:55.035 --> 03:56.270
at Jalapeno Jack's.

03:56.304 --> 03:57.471
Hold up, free drinks?

03:57.505 --> 03:59.473
And appetizers.

03:59.507 --> 04:00.541
That's a pricey place.

04:00.574 --> 04:01.575
How can they afford that?

04:01.609 --> 04:02.576
I don't know.

04:02.610 --> 04:03.944
I don't make the coupons.

04:09.450 --> 04:10.484
Oh, man, it expires tonight.

04:10.518 --> 04:12.686
Oh, I kept meaning to use it.

04:12.720 --> 04:14.455
I wanted to take Trent,

04:14.488 --> 04:15.689
but he's working late tonight.

04:15.723 --> 04:16.690
Here, you want to take it?

04:16.724 --> 04:17.725
Uh, take Valencia.

04:17.757 --> 04:19.392
Oh, thanks.
Yeah.

04:19.427 --> 04:20.394
That'd be great.

04:20.428 --> 04:21.394
(gasps)
Thursday night.

04:21.428 --> 04:22.696
She has back-to-back classes.

04:22.730 --> 04:27.034
Oh, no,
she's also working tonight.

04:27.067 --> 04:29.703
Okay, well, this'll go unused,
no harm, no foul.

04:29.737 --> 04:30.704
Good-bye, coupon.

04:30.738 --> 04:31.705
Wait, hold up.

04:31.739 --> 04:33.073
If your date is busy

04:33.106 --> 04:34.908
and my date is busy,

04:34.942 --> 04:36.477
and the coupon
expires tonight...

04:37.811 --> 04:39.880
...should we
just go together?

04:39.913 --> 04:42.683
Oh. Oh, I hadn't
thought of that.

04:42.716 --> 04:44.718
Um, yeah, that sounds good.
Yeah.

04:44.752 --> 04:46.654
REBECCA
 Houston, this is Apollo.

04:46.687 --> 04:48.422
Jalapeno Jack's is a go.

04:48.456 --> 04:50.624
Repeat, Jalapeno Jack's
is a go.

04:56.664 --> 04:58.899
(sighs)

04:58.932 --> 05:02.436
And that's how you land a plane.

05:03.571 --> 05:04.972
REBECCA:
We did it, we did it!

05:05.005 --> 05:06.507
(cheering)

05:06.540 --> 05:07.975
(squealing)

05:08.008 --> 05:09.610
We did it.

05:09.643 --> 05:10.778
Oh, we did,

05:10.811 --> 05:13.481
and it was pretty easy.

05:13.514 --> 05:14.782
Whoa.

05:14.815 --> 05:16.484
Whoa.

05:16.517 --> 05:17.651
Yay, we did it.

05:17.685 --> 05:18.852
You have a dinner plan.

05:18.886 --> 05:20.020
Now you and Josh

05:20.053 --> 05:21.522
can get back on track.

05:21.555 --> 05:23.391
Get back to where you were
a couple weeks ago,

05:23.424 --> 05:25.493
when you were practically
about to bone.

05:25.526 --> 05:27.395
Oh, it's gonna be so romantic,

05:27.428 --> 05:28.729
just the two of you,

05:28.762 --> 05:30.398
in a cozy corner booth

05:30.431 --> 05:32.666
snuggling over a pitcher
of margaritas.

05:32.700 --> 05:34.134
(popping)
Ooh.

05:34.167 --> 05:37.571
Ooh.
Ooh.
Nice.

05:37.605 --> 05:39.039
This looks like fun.

05:39.072 --> 05:40.073
What are we fêting?

05:41.509 --> 05:42.576
And speaking of fêting,

05:42.610 --> 05:43.811
and, uh, feeling good

05:43.844 --> 05:45.379
and other words that start

05:45.413 --> 05:47.415
with the letter "F,"

05:47.448 --> 05:48.749
um, like fitness...

05:48.782 --> 05:50.951
Rebecca, how well do
you know White Josh?

05:52.019 --> 05:55.055
Uh, I barely know him.

05:55.088 --> 05:57.157
I was just wondering, um,

05:57.190 --> 05:59.727
do you think he would
be open to new...

06:00.828 --> 06:02.763
...clients?

06:02.796 --> 06:04.898
At the gym, I mean?

06:04.932 --> 06:05.999
'Cause, uh, I need a trainer.

06:07.167 --> 06:08.636
Darryl,
I literally know nothing

06:08.669 --> 06:10.003
about White Josh.

06:10.037 --> 06:11.672
Why don't you just
ask him yourself?

06:11.705 --> 06:14.508
Okay, okay,
I just thought I'd ask around

06:14.542 --> 06:15.776
before I got in bed
with a new person.

06:15.809 --> 06:16.944
(Darryl chuckles)

06:16.977 --> 06:18.912
Gym, that is.

06:18.946 --> 06:19.947
(laughs)

06:19.980 --> 06:21.949
A gym bed,
is what I meant.

06:21.982 --> 06:23.751
You know, there are
no beds in gyms.

06:23.784 --> 06:25.686
Yeah, I think
there should be.

06:25.719 --> 06:29.657
Okay, well, I got to take off.

06:31.859 --> 06:34.828
(banda music plays)

06:34.862 --> 06:36.997
(bell jingles, door closes)
Uh, hi, two.

06:37.030 --> 06:38.532
Oh, sorry.

06:42.536 --> 06:44.004
WOMAN:
We'll have it ready
in about 15 minutes.

06:44.037 --> 06:46.139
REBECCA:
 Water conspiracy?

06:46.173 --> 06:47.641
Water Truthers?

06:47.675 --> 06:48.876
You're nuts, Bert.

06:48.909 --> 06:50.143
Thank you.
(hangs up phone)

06:53.681 --> 06:57.184
Hello, so I have a couple
questions about the menu, um...
Mm-hmm.

06:57.217 --> 07:01.188
The El Potato Soupo, is that,
like, a mashed potato dish?

07:01.221 --> 07:02.756
It's soup.

07:02.790 --> 07:04.725
Cheesy soup, has a lot of,
like, cheese in it.

07:04.758 --> 07:07.795
Okay, good to know,
that's maybe a little heavy.

07:07.828 --> 07:09.897
Now, what about the
Quesadilla Saladita.

07:09.930 --> 07:11.031
What happens there?

07:11.064 --> 07:12.600
Um, it's a salad with,

07:12.633 --> 07:14.468
like, stuff on it.

07:14.502 --> 07:16.737
Okay. Okay, good to know.
That's on the list.

07:16.770 --> 07:18.205
Uh, now, eventually

07:18.238 --> 07:19.740
at the end of the meal,
we're gonna want

07:19.773 --> 07:21.909
the passion fruit soufflé,
but I have a query.

07:21.942 --> 07:23.611
Could I get mango

07:23.644 --> 07:25.045
instead of passion fruit?
Because my friend

07:25.078 --> 07:26.714
who's joining me,
he really loves mango.

07:26.747 --> 07:27.981
Um...

07:28.015 --> 07:29.249
Also, hold that answer

07:29.282 --> 07:30.618
for one second,
I think

07:30.651 --> 07:31.819
we're probably
gonna want to start out

07:31.852 --> 07:33.621
with the Margarita Mas Grande,

07:33.654 --> 07:34.922
with salt on the rim,
but only half of the rim,

07:34.955 --> 07:36.490
because too much salt
makes my friend bloat.

07:36.524 --> 07:38.726
I'm gonna give you
a few more minutes.

07:38.759 --> 07:40.628
Okay, great.

07:40.661 --> 07:42.663
(banda music plays)

07:42.696 --> 07:44.498
(chuckling)

07:44.532 --> 07:47.067
I can't believe
this is free.

07:47.100 --> 07:48.602
Yeah, I know, right?
Oh.

07:48.636 --> 07:50.604
So, as you were saying
about your apartment...

07:50.638 --> 07:53.974
Oh, yeah, I haven't had
hot water in, like, weeks.

07:54.007 --> 07:56.243
I'm showering
with freezing cold water.

07:56.276 --> 07:58.245
No hot water, that's terrible.

07:58.278 --> 07:59.613
You should complain.

07:59.647 --> 08:02.516
Yeah, I don't like
to complain about stuff.

08:02.550 --> 08:03.951
Valencia is better
at complaining...

08:05.118 --> 08:06.720
...and since she's not
on the lease,

08:06.754 --> 08:07.988
she can't give the landlord
a hard time.

08:08.021 --> 08:09.523
Wait, Valencia's
not on the lease?

08:09.557 --> 08:10.924
She has bad credit.

08:10.958 --> 08:13.026
She took a loan out
to sell diet supplements,

08:13.060 --> 08:14.762
and it turned out
they were rat droppings.

08:14.795 --> 08:16.830
(laughs)

08:16.864 --> 08:18.165
Yeah, gross.

08:18.198 --> 08:19.166
(laughs)

08:19.199 --> 08:20.233
Man, it's really good

08:20.267 --> 08:21.735
to catch up.

08:21.769 --> 08:24.572
I've, um, I've been kind of
lonely lately.

08:24.605 --> 08:27.741
Oh, but you're seeing someone...

08:27.775 --> 08:29.743
Right. Right, right, right,
right, right, Trent.

08:29.777 --> 08:30.544
Trent. Yes.

08:30.578 --> 08:32.746
I've been lonely,
save for Trent.

08:32.780 --> 08:34.748
No, Trent's amazing.

08:34.782 --> 08:36.817
Trent and Rebecca,

08:36.850 --> 08:38.852
we have the greatest
couple name, actually.

08:38.885 --> 08:40.688
Trebecca.
Oh.
Yeah.

08:40.721 --> 08:42.789
I want to get it monogrammed
on a towel.

08:42.823 --> 08:45.593
Yeah, that sounds romantic.

08:45.626 --> 08:49.563
Uh, yeah,
it's-it's pretty romantic.

08:49.597 --> 08:51.565
(door opens, bell jingles)

08:51.599 --> 08:53.867
Oh, no, Hector's here.

08:53.901 --> 08:54.702
Huh?

08:54.735 --> 08:55.803
Yo.

08:55.836 --> 08:59.106
I mean, aw, nah, it's Hector.

08:59.139 --> 09:01.809
What's up?
What's up, dude?

09:01.842 --> 09:03.777
It's so weird that
you guys are here.

09:03.811 --> 09:04.978
(door opens, bell jingles)
(grunts in confusion)

09:05.012 --> 09:06.313
Yeah.
Huh.

09:06.346 --> 09:08.582
What? Oh, my God,
more people here.

09:08.616 --> 09:09.950
Oh, oh, oh.

09:09.983 --> 09:11.151
White Josh,

09:11.184 --> 09:12.219
and some other guys

09:12.252 --> 09:13.320
I don't know.

09:13.353 --> 09:14.722
Hello.

09:14.755 --> 09:16.690
Such a coinky, yo.
Can we join you guys?

09:16.724 --> 09:18.692
Uh, you know, I just think
this table won't fit...

09:18.726 --> 09:20.728
Of course! Come on, man.

09:20.761 --> 09:21.862
(men laughing)

09:21.895 --> 09:23.363
Oh, look at that.
The tables move.

09:23.396 --> 09:24.364
You guys just knew that.

09:24.397 --> 09:25.465
Oh, um, um,

09:25.498 --> 09:27.334
the coupon doesn't limit
the amount of people, right?

09:28.869 --> 09:31.905
Nope, whoever made it
did not think that through.

09:31.939 --> 09:33.006
Cool.

09:33.040 --> 09:34.708
Oh, sorry, I'm so rude.

09:34.742 --> 09:36.710
Um, Becks, you haven't met
Ken and Beans yet, have you?

09:36.744 --> 09:37.911
Nope.

09:37.945 --> 09:40.047
Um, Ken, Becks,
Beans, Becks.

09:40.080 --> 09:41.915
Becks, Ken,
Becks, Beans.

09:41.949 --> 09:43.817
Hi. Okay.
Oh, wait, Rebecca,

09:43.851 --> 09:45.719
you went to Beans' party, right?

09:45.753 --> 09:48.722
You know what, yeah, I did,
first week I was in town.

09:48.756 --> 09:50.357
Uh, you have a
lovely casa, Bernard.

09:50.390 --> 09:51.859
Oh, I don't go by Bernard.

09:51.892 --> 09:54.094
I prefer Beans.
It sounds racist,

09:54.127 --> 09:55.863
but I didn't get the name
'cause I'm Mexican,

09:55.896 --> 09:57.731
it's 'cause I organize
meet-and-trades

09:57.765 --> 09:58.999
for Beanie Babies.

09:59.032 --> 10:01.869
HECTOR:
Whoa, I'm so excited
about this coupon.

10:01.902 --> 10:03.370
Let's get the margaritas
that come in a sombrero.

10:03.403 --> 10:04.371
(men whooping)

10:04.404 --> 10:05.773
I'm gonna drink until I die.

10:05.806 --> 10:07.007
MEN (laughing):
Yeah!

10:07.040 --> 10:08.375
Time to get drunk!

10:08.408 --> 10:10.744
(whispering):
Um, hey, hey, Josh...

10:10.778 --> 10:12.045
(overlapping chatter)

10:12.079 --> 10:14.381
(whispering):
So, I just-I just thought
this was gonna be

10:14.414 --> 10:16.283
you and me, hanging out.

10:16.316 --> 10:18.085
(shouting):
What?
(shouting):
I just thought this was gonna

10:18.118 --> 10:19.920
be you and me hanging out...

10:19.953 --> 10:21.354
(men continue
chattering loudly)

10:21.388 --> 10:24.224
I-it's fine.

10:24.257 --> 10:25.292
It's fine.

10:25.325 --> 10:26.359
Continue. This is fun.

10:26.393 --> 10:28.095
This is fun.
It's fine.

10:28.128 --> 10:31.832
Dude,
can you believe this?

10:34.702 --> 10:37.404
*

10:37.437 --> 10:39.940
* The night was going perfectly,
mi amor *

10:39.973 --> 10:42.442
* We were having a romantic
Mexican meal *

10:42.475 --> 10:44.044
* Or Cali-Mex

10:44.077 --> 10:45.813
* Cali-Mex-Italian

10:45.846 --> 10:47.848
* I don't really know what
this food is *

10:47.881 --> 10:51.685
* But our time together was cut
short by the enemy of romance *

10:51.719 --> 10:53.386
* La, la, la, la, la

10:53.420 --> 10:54.788
* It was a group hang

10:54.822 --> 10:56.456
* Group hang
you're so far away *

10:56.489 --> 10:57.958
* In a group hang

10:57.991 --> 11:00.093
* A group hang,
group hang *

11:00.127 --> 11:02.195
* Do we really need
all these nachos? *

11:02.229 --> 11:04.297
* It was an intimate date,
just you and me *

11:04.331 --> 11:06.834
* At a magical place
where refills are free *

11:06.867 --> 11:08.201
* Then your buddies showed up

11:08.235 --> 11:10.037
* And tore us apart,
they're forces of evil *

11:10.070 --> 11:11.371
* A knife through my heart

11:11.404 --> 11:14.842
* Salsa, burritos, taquitos

11:14.875 --> 11:15.843
* Guacamole pizza

11:15.876 --> 11:17.945
* A group hang,
group hang *

11:17.978 --> 11:19.980
* You're just out of reach
in a group hang *

11:20.013 --> 11:21.348
* A group hang

11:21.381 --> 11:22.482
* Group hang

11:22.515 --> 11:24.885
* I'm so afraid of horses

11:24.918 --> 11:26.787
* Now you're telling a story
about some dude named Jeffwad *

11:26.820 --> 11:28.155
* And the time he "sprooshed"

11:28.188 --> 11:30.357
* Whatever that means

11:30.390 --> 11:32.960
* Feeling left out,
so I jump in and say *

11:32.993 --> 11:34.494
I had a friend named Jeff once.

11:34.527 --> 11:37.264
He took bad mushrooms and jumped
off the roof of our dorm.

11:40.267 --> 11:42.502
* It was a group hang,
group hang *

11:42.535 --> 11:44.938
* It just got weird
in this group hang *

11:44.972 --> 11:47.040
* Group hang,
group hang *

11:47.074 --> 11:49.209
* It makes me so sexy sad

11:49.242 --> 11:50.878
Oh, the guac is so spicy.

11:50.911 --> 11:52.880
Hey, want to grab a drink
at the bar?

11:52.913 --> 11:54.214
Oh, uh, okay.

11:54.247 --> 11:55.248
Great.

11:56.817 --> 11:59.887
* Spanish, Spanish,
Spanish, Spanish, español *

11:59.920 --> 12:01.989
* Arriba, Spanish, Spanish,
Spanish, Spanish, español *

12:02.022 --> 12:03.423
* Arriba Spanish, Spanish,
Spanish, Spanish *

12:03.456 --> 12:06.293
* Español, arriba,
Guadalajara, Sicily *

12:06.326 --> 12:08.028
That's not in Mexico.

12:08.061 --> 12:10.130
* Corned beef enchilada,
pickle taco *

12:10.163 --> 12:12.099
* Salsa verde cheesecake,
bacon tamale *

12:12.132 --> 12:14.101
* Root beer margarita,
taco stew *

12:14.134 --> 12:16.536
Does the chef know
what Mexico is?

12:16.569 --> 12:18.538
* A group hang,
group hang *

12:18.571 --> 12:20.974
* What's this smoky
tortilla soup thang *

12:21.008 --> 12:22.442
I mean, really, am I-am I crazy?

12:22.475 --> 12:24.011
There are--
I know there are people

12:24.044 --> 12:25.813
of Hispanic descent
working at this restaurant.

12:25.846 --> 12:27.815
* A group hang,
group hang *

12:27.848 --> 12:29.016
How are they not offended

12:29.049 --> 12:30.350
with the bastardization
of their culture?

12:30.383 --> 12:32.285
Is it just me?
Maybe it's just me.

12:32.319 --> 12:34.822
* You're so far away
in a group hang *

12:34.855 --> 12:36.123
If... I just...
I feel-I feel like

12:36.156 --> 12:38.158
I'm being gaslighted
by this restaurant.

12:38.191 --> 12:41.394
* A group hang,
group hang... *

12:48.035 --> 12:49.236
There you go.

12:49.269 --> 12:50.270
*

12:52.405 --> 12:53.506
I forgot
my wallet.

12:53.540 --> 12:54.908
BEANS:
I only had the nachos.

12:54.942 --> 12:57.044
KEN:
I only had, like,
one stuffed mushroom.

12:57.077 --> 12:58.278
WHITE JOSH:
Uh, Hector's paying
for me actually,

12:58.311 --> 12:59.479
'cause he uses
my Netflix account.

12:59.512 --> 13:02.082
I'll... Guys, guys,
I got it, I got it.

13:02.115 --> 13:03.150
Don't worry.

13:03.183 --> 13:05.085
Oh, come on.
What, no...

13:05.118 --> 13:07.087
Give me that...
You ain't got
to do all of that.

13:07.120 --> 13:08.088
No, Ken, Ken,
it's really fine.

13:08.121 --> 13:09.156
I-I-I got it.

13:09.189 --> 13:12.192
KEN:
good thing
the drinks are free.

13:14.627 --> 13:17.097
Hmm, you really saved a ton
with that coupon, huh?

13:17.130 --> 13:18.065
Yeah.

13:18.098 --> 13:19.867
Oh, man, that was good.
Yup.

13:19.900 --> 13:22.035
Mmm. Mmm.
Mmm.
(inhales)

13:24.171 --> 13:25.505
Congratulations.

13:25.538 --> 13:27.040
What are you... doing?

13:27.074 --> 13:29.576
Anyone who spends over $600

13:29.609 --> 13:31.411
gets their picture
taken for the wall.

13:31.444 --> 13:33.446
No... (sighs)

13:35.115 --> 13:36.449
JOSH:
Hey, thanks for coming, man.

13:36.483 --> 13:37.885
HECTOR:
Are you kidding?

13:37.918 --> 13:39.252
I had dieciséis
margaritas.

13:39.286 --> 13:40.954
(Josh laughs)
HECTOR:
It was awesome, right?

13:40.988 --> 13:43.323
Yeah, I just still feel kind
of weird after what happened

13:43.356 --> 13:45.292
at Rebecca's apartment
the other day.

13:45.325 --> 13:48.528
So, after I mentioned dinner,
I kind of freaked,

13:48.561 --> 13:51.064
and that's why I called
you guys for backup.

13:51.098 --> 13:53.633
HECTOR:
Yeah, dude, don't
worry about it.

13:53.666 --> 13:55.268
Say queso.

13:55.302 --> 13:56.970
Queso.

13:57.004 --> 13:58.005
*

14:07.647 --> 14:10.617
I'm sorry, honey.

14:10.650 --> 14:13.120
I'm sorry the rocket
exploded on re-entry.

14:14.354 --> 14:15.622
Yeah, so, I think we're done

14:15.655 --> 14:18.058
with the Apollo 13 references.

14:18.091 --> 14:19.592
Okay.

14:19.626 --> 14:22.495
I just want to spend time
with him.

14:22.529 --> 14:24.464
(sighs)

14:24.497 --> 14:27.968
I want so badly to go back
to the way things were.

14:28.001 --> 14:30.570
* Romantic moments you had

14:30.603 --> 14:34.241
* That he didn't know
were romantic *

14:34.274 --> 14:34.942
(Josh grunting)

14:34.975 --> 14:38.278
* Or maybe he did a little

14:38.311 --> 14:41.181
* We're not really sure

14:41.214 --> 14:43.683
*

14:43.716 --> 14:48.188
* But most likely not

14:48.221 --> 14:52.325
* Ooh...

14:53.726 --> 14:56.396
But now I freaked him out.

14:58.131 --> 15:00.333
God, I am so afraid
that it's over,

15:00.367 --> 15:02.602
that things will never be normal
between us ever again.

15:02.635 --> 15:04.171
Josh just doesn't want

15:04.204 --> 15:05.672
to spend time
with me anymore.

15:05.705 --> 15:08.441
Oh, I was so close,

15:08.475 --> 15:10.110
and now he won't even
be alone with me.

15:10.143 --> 15:13.080
God, I am never alone.

15:13.113 --> 15:14.514
This client requires
so much handholding,

15:14.547 --> 15:15.715
it's like we're married.

15:15.748 --> 15:19.052
Last week we go to
Fresno for a hearing.

15:19.086 --> 15:20.220
The hotel's overbooked,

15:20.253 --> 15:21.721
so we get a room
with one bed,

15:21.754 --> 15:23.590
and then I'm between the sheets

15:23.623 --> 15:25.392
with his body pressed
against mine.

15:25.425 --> 15:27.727
Oh, last week
I saw more of him

15:27.760 --> 15:29.396
than I did
my own wife.

15:29.429 --> 15:30.563
And I mean literally,

15:30.597 --> 15:32.232
because I saw him naked,
like, eight times.

15:33.666 --> 15:35.702
That's genius.

15:35.735 --> 15:37.070
We make him a client.
Client.

15:37.104 --> 15:37.737
All we need is a case.

15:37.770 --> 15:38.972
I love it.

15:39.006 --> 15:40.473
Wait, also...

15:40.507 --> 15:42.209
I love that we all had

15:42.242 --> 15:43.643
the same idea at the same time.

15:43.676 --> 15:45.545
It's like we're on each other's
mental cycle.

15:45.578 --> 15:46.413
Totally.

15:46.446 --> 15:47.547
So, what do we do?

15:47.580 --> 15:48.581
Uh, what case

15:48.615 --> 15:50.650
can you help Josh with?

15:50.683 --> 15:52.752
Or do we just get him arrested
and then go from there?

15:52.785 --> 15:54.154
No, come on.

15:54.187 --> 15:56.723
I'm a member of the bar,
I swore an oath.

15:56.756 --> 15:58.225
Also, I lied to Josh once...

15:58.258 --> 15:59.726
Once?

15:59.759 --> 16:02.462
...okay, I got caught once
and it was the worst feeling,

16:02.495 --> 16:03.730
and I'm never doing it again.

16:03.763 --> 16:05.132
So, no made-up cases.

16:05.165 --> 16:06.633
Fine, okay,
we don't make up anything,

16:06.666 --> 16:08.535
we find something.
Something legit.

16:08.568 --> 16:10.203
Something you can
actually help him with.

16:10.237 --> 16:11.304
Exactly.

16:11.338 --> 16:12.305
How...

16:12.339 --> 16:13.373
do... we...

16:13.406 --> 16:14.674
do... that?

16:14.707 --> 16:16.709
Okay, you don't want
to lie to him.

16:17.644 --> 16:19.346
Can we hurt him?

16:19.379 --> 16:20.580
Just a little bit.

16:20.613 --> 16:21.614
Like, scalding coffee

16:21.648 --> 16:23.316
from a takeout place.

16:23.350 --> 16:24.551
Or...

16:24.584 --> 16:26.619
Ooh! He works at that
radiology lab.

16:26.653 --> 16:28.688
Oh, come on, that place looks
like a cancer factory,

16:28.721 --> 16:30.723
surely he has a tumor somewhere.

16:30.757 --> 16:32.559
What do tumors cause?

16:32.592 --> 16:34.061
Water on the brain...

16:34.094 --> 16:37.164
Water.
Wait, I know a real thing.

16:37.197 --> 16:38.665
WHITE JOSH:
Okay, focus, focus.

16:38.698 --> 16:39.799
Stay focused,
you got three more.

16:39.832 --> 16:41.734
Keep your eyes on me.

16:41.768 --> 16:42.802
Oh, I am.

16:42.835 --> 16:44.037
All right. Two.

16:44.071 --> 16:45.438
Are you breathing?

16:45.472 --> 16:46.773
I feel like you're
not breathing at all.

16:46.806 --> 16:48.341
I'm not breathing?
You're not breathing.

16:48.375 --> 16:49.709
You know what, let's,
uh, let's take a break.

16:49.742 --> 16:51.344
Doing great.
Okay.

16:51.378 --> 16:52.779
I'm gonna-I'm gonna
put these down.
Okay.

16:52.812 --> 16:53.780
Take 60 seconds.

16:53.813 --> 16:55.648
Mm-hmm.

16:56.716 --> 16:58.651
Okay.

16:58.685 --> 17:00.520
So, when was the last time
we saw each other?

17:00.553 --> 17:03.523
At your house, the fight.

17:03.556 --> 17:05.592
Yeah, yeah, well, that-that
was the general event,

17:05.625 --> 17:06.759
but the specific event was...

17:06.792 --> 17:08.728
When I kissed you on the cheek?

17:08.761 --> 17:11.631
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, that was, uh, funny.

17:11.664 --> 17:13.366
(laughs) I mean, was that,
like, a European thing,

17:13.400 --> 17:15.367
or was that something
Hector put you up to?

17:15.402 --> 17:16.703
No, dude, I'm gay.

17:16.736 --> 17:18.338
You were being cute, so...

17:18.371 --> 17:19.739
You're gay?

17:19.771 --> 17:20.740
No one's ever mentioned that.

17:20.772 --> 17:22.842
Uh, well, everybody knows.

17:22.875 --> 17:24.511
It's not a big deal.
Oh.

17:24.544 --> 17:26.613
Okay, it's just...
maybe your nickname

17:26.646 --> 17:27.847
should be Gay Josh
instead of White Josh,

17:27.880 --> 17:29.682
because then people
would know what's up.

17:29.716 --> 17:30.817
Why?

17:30.850 --> 17:32.352
We don't call Greg,
Straight Greg.

17:32.385 --> 17:34.654
We don't call you,
Old Gay Darryl.

17:34.687 --> 17:35.722
Whoa, what?

17:35.755 --> 17:36.789
I am not old gay.

17:36.823 --> 17:38.458
I am not... or gay.

17:38.491 --> 17:39.826
I'm... divorced.

17:39.859 --> 17:40.760
I-I'm sorry, I didn't mean

17:40.793 --> 17:41.761
anything by that, you just...

17:41.794 --> 17:43.130
No, no.
...gave me the vibe.

17:43.163 --> 17:45.298
No. What-what vibe?
The gay vibe.

17:45.332 --> 17:46.499
But I don't understand
why there would be a vibe.

17:46.533 --> 17:47.700
I like women.
I like sleeping with women.

17:47.734 --> 17:48.701
I like the way
they smell,

17:48.735 --> 17:49.769
and I like the
way that they...

17:49.802 --> 17:50.770
the-the feel
of their skin,

17:50.803 --> 17:53.640
I like their
bird-like voices.

17:53.673 --> 17:54.807
I mean, does that sound gay?

17:54.841 --> 17:55.842
Nope.

17:55.875 --> 17:57.510
Sounds like a serial killer,

17:57.544 --> 17:59.146
but a straight one, for sure.

17:59.179 --> 18:00.847
Yeah, a straight ser...
What? No.

18:00.880 --> 18:02.482
You know what, I think
this is enough right now.

18:02.515 --> 18:03.550
Okay.
Because you
know what,

18:03.583 --> 18:04.584
I actually have
to return a call
Yup.

18:04.617 --> 18:05.618
to my ex-wife,
Sure.

18:05.652 --> 18:06.753
who's a girl.
Uh-huh.

18:06.786 --> 18:07.520
You know?
No problem.

18:07.554 --> 18:08.855
We actually
reproduced together.

18:08.888 --> 18:10.857
Okay.

18:10.890 --> 18:12.325
Cool.
That's-that's not
something you can do solo.

18:12.359 --> 18:13.826
That's... a good point.

18:13.860 --> 18:15.094
That's teamwork.

18:15.895 --> 18:18.365
(door closes)

18:20.300 --> 18:22.569
VALENCIA:
So, what is this
stupid meeting about?

18:22.602 --> 18:23.803
Well, I'm here to dis...

18:23.836 --> 18:25.672
Oh, this is the
boyfriend, huh?

18:25.705 --> 18:27.474
JOSH:
Uh, Trent.
His name is Trent,

18:27.507 --> 18:28.741
and he went to Harvard.
REBECCA:
Yes.

18:28.775 --> 18:29.909
Great picture.

18:29.942 --> 18:30.910
Where was it taken?

18:30.943 --> 18:31.911
Palm Springs.

18:31.944 --> 18:34.214
Ah, hm, we just had to spa.

18:36.783 --> 18:40.420
Okay, let's start this meeting,
shall we?

18:40.453 --> 18:41.621
Great.

18:41.654 --> 18:43.790
Valencia,

18:43.823 --> 18:44.824
tell me something.

18:45.858 --> 18:48.428
Does your ass feel weird
right now?

18:48.461 --> 18:50.297
Joshy, what is she
talking about?

18:50.330 --> 18:53.466
Because you, my friends,
are sitting on a gold mine.

18:53.500 --> 18:54.934
You remember
the other night,

18:54.967 --> 18:56.836
at that really fun group hang,

18:56.869 --> 18:58.471
you were telling me about
the lack of hot water

18:58.505 --> 18:59.906
in your apartment.
Yeah.

18:59.939 --> 19:02.209
Well, did you know that's
not only an annoyance,

19:02.242 --> 19:03.843
but it's also a violation

19:03.876 --> 19:05.378
of your contractual
tenant rights?

19:05.412 --> 19:06.613
Get to the point, Harvard.

19:06.646 --> 19:09.449
My point is,
we can sue your landlord

19:09.482 --> 19:11.251
for all of the back rent
that you've paid

19:11.284 --> 19:12.852
since you moved in,
plus damages.

19:12.885 --> 19:14.887
Whoa, that would be, like,
thousands of dollars.

19:14.921 --> 19:16.423
Wait a minute.
Hold on.

19:16.456 --> 19:18.258
What's in it for you?

19:19.292 --> 19:21.794
It's purely a business decision.

19:21.828 --> 19:23.930
I wouldn't charge you a fee,
I would take a percentage.

19:23.963 --> 19:24.864
You make money, I make money.

19:24.897 --> 19:26.299
That's...

19:26.333 --> 19:28.935
really nice of you.

19:28.968 --> 19:31.238
We could use the cash, babe.

19:32.305 --> 19:33.973
Well, great.

19:34.006 --> 19:35.208
Let's set you up here.

19:35.242 --> 19:36.709
All I need is both
your signatures

19:36.743 --> 19:37.777
where it says tenant.

19:37.810 --> 19:41.214
Um, there's a problem.

19:41.248 --> 19:42.849
Oh right, I'm-I'm sorry,
my mistake,

19:42.882 --> 19:44.917
Josh mentioned that you, uh,
weren't on the lease.

19:44.951 --> 19:46.419
Josh, you told her?

19:46.453 --> 19:48.421
You know how sensitive
I am about the lease.

19:49.689 --> 19:50.923
It's-it's okay.

19:50.957 --> 19:51.924
We can just make Josh

19:51.958 --> 19:52.925
the sole plaintiff, no biggie.

19:52.959 --> 19:54.427
A-And then we can make

19:54.461 --> 19:55.562
thousands of dollars.

19:55.595 --> 19:56.929
R-right, Rebecca?

19:56.963 --> 19:58.265
Yes, at least.

20:04.304 --> 20:05.738
No.

20:05.772 --> 20:07.274
No, no.

20:07.307 --> 20:08.775
We're not doing this.

20:08.808 --> 20:10.977
I don't trust you
as far as I can throw you,

20:11.010 --> 20:12.279
which is not far,

20:12.312 --> 20:14.947
because you eat bagels
after 8:00 p.m.

20:16.316 --> 20:18.385
Come on, Josh.

20:19.886 --> 20:21.388
I'm sorry, that was rude.

20:23.823 --> 20:25.692
Okay, fine.

20:25.725 --> 20:27.960
Enjoy your cold showers!

20:27.994 --> 20:29.496
Yeah,
and don't underestimate

20:29.529 --> 20:31.698
the joy of a
midnight bagel.

20:31.731 --> 20:33.466
Thank you.

20:34.501 --> 20:35.702
Okay, we did it your way.

20:35.735 --> 20:36.869
Can we now scald him

20:36.903 --> 20:37.904
with gas station coffee?

20:50.317 --> 20:51.418
Man, a settlement
could mean

20:51.451 --> 20:53.019
a lot for me
and Valencia.

20:53.052 --> 20:54.921
She has all this stuff
she wants to buy,

20:54.954 --> 20:57.490
and I want a hoverboard,
obviously,

20:57.524 --> 20:59.926
but I also want to
invest in our future.

20:59.959 --> 21:01.394
Buy a stock.

21:01.428 --> 21:03.330
Or two stocks.

21:03.363 --> 21:04.897
How many stocks
do people have?

21:04.931 --> 21:06.999
I don't know, I'm just a kid.

21:07.033 --> 21:08.835
All I know is,
tech is overvalued right now.

21:08.868 --> 21:09.836
All right, shh.

21:09.869 --> 21:12.372
It's Serrano. Okay,
don't tell him any of this.

21:12.405 --> 21:15.408
He's got lots of opinions
and he's very judgmental.

21:15.442 --> 21:16.776
Oh, I already told him.

21:16.809 --> 21:17.910
What? How?

21:17.944 --> 21:19.546
I've been texting
under the table

21:19.579 --> 21:21.047
the whole time we were talking.

21:21.080 --> 21:22.749
I'm a digital addict.

21:22.782 --> 21:24.417
I diagnosed myself online.

21:24.451 --> 21:25.585
GREG:
What are you doing?

21:25.618 --> 21:27.554
Hey, Greg.
You're doing some lawsuit

21:27.587 --> 21:29.456
with Rebecca about water
or something?

21:29.489 --> 21:30.757
All right, I haven't decided,

21:30.790 --> 21:31.991
but I can make
the decision myself.

21:32.024 --> 21:33.393
I'm not dumb.

21:33.426 --> 21:34.427
Dude, this time that's

21:34.461 --> 21:35.595
not what I'm saying.

21:35.628 --> 21:37.096
I haven't said anything
because I know

21:37.129 --> 21:38.731
you like Rebecca,

21:38.765 --> 21:41.033
but I've had some serious doubts
for a while now,

21:41.067 --> 21:42.802
and I just don't want you
to get mixed up in anything...

21:42.835 --> 21:44.604
Dude, she went to Harvard

21:44.637 --> 21:47.807
and she thinks Valencia and I
could get a lot of money.

21:47.840 --> 21:49.075
That's what
Satan told Faust.

21:50.009 --> 21:50.977
Oh, you guys didn't know?

21:51.010 --> 21:51.978
My school went charter.

21:52.011 --> 21:53.946
Chan,
you're a nice guy.

21:53.980 --> 21:55.448
You always see things
in the best light,

21:55.482 --> 21:56.616
but Valencia is right.

21:56.649 --> 21:57.617
Rebecca is into you.

21:57.650 --> 21:58.918
She always has been.

21:58.951 --> 22:00.653
She just wants to
spend time with you.

22:00.687 --> 22:02.355
Why can't anyone see that?

22:02.389 --> 22:04.957
The whole case
is just a pretext.

22:04.991 --> 22:06.526
A pretext.

22:06.559 --> 22:08.395
Is that like when a little text

22:08.428 --> 22:10.797
comes out before the real text?

22:10.830 --> 22:12.131
I learned about that
in health class.

22:12.164 --> 22:14.401
A-alright, I got to go.
I have to think.

22:14.434 --> 22:16.403
I want you to protect yourself,
Josh.

22:16.436 --> 22:18.538
Rebecca is not
what she seems to be.

22:18.571 --> 22:20.072
That thing with
the broken glass?

22:20.106 --> 22:21.073
She was up to something.

22:21.107 --> 22:22.409
She's too smart.

22:22.442 --> 22:23.643
She will outsmart you.

22:23.676 --> 22:25.044
Dude, I can take care of myself.

22:25.077 --> 22:26.446
I've got a lot of black belts.

22:26.479 --> 22:27.980
She's not trying to fight you.

22:28.014 --> 22:29.482
I said I have to think about it.

22:29.516 --> 22:31.017
I haven't decided
what I'm gonna do,

22:31.050 --> 22:32.652
and I know she has issues,

22:32.685 --> 22:34.454
and maybe she's
a little into me,

22:34.487 --> 22:35.888
but, you know,
most girls in town are.

22:35.922 --> 22:37.924
Word.
Thanks.

22:37.957 --> 22:39.892
And why are you
lecturing me, Serrano?

22:39.926 --> 22:41.561
You're the one that kept
trying to go out with her.

22:41.594 --> 22:43.596
I know, I did,
but I know better now,

22:43.630 --> 22:44.664
and I'm with Heather,

22:44.697 --> 22:46.399
and it's so great not thinking

22:46.433 --> 22:47.867
about Rebecca's insanity.

22:47.900 --> 22:49.469
Okay, nope, you're wrong.

22:49.502 --> 22:51.170
I just hung with her
and I got to say,

22:51.203 --> 22:53.506
she seems like
she's in a good place.

22:53.540 --> 22:55.442
She's keeping her car
in great shape,

22:55.475 --> 22:57.744
and she's even got a boyfriend
who went to Harvard,

22:57.777 --> 23:00.447
and has a name that sounds
like a newscaster.

23:00.480 --> 23:02.181
Connie Chung?
Wait.

23:02.214 --> 23:04.150
She has a boyfriend?
Well...

23:04.183 --> 23:06.453
someone she's seeing.
Trent.

23:06.486 --> 23:08.054
Their couple name
is Trebecca.
Since when?

23:09.055 --> 23:10.857
Trent?

23:10.890 --> 23:13.025
That's the perfect name
for a fake boyfriend.

23:13.059 --> 23:14.160
Stop it.

23:14.193 --> 23:16.663
Look, even if
you think Rebecca is,

23:16.696 --> 23:18.531
whatever you think she is,

23:18.565 --> 23:20.467
you know she's
an excellent lawyer,

23:20.500 --> 23:21.768
really on top of her game.

23:21.801 --> 23:24.637
PAULA:
Oh, I just love
mixed race babies.

23:24.671 --> 23:26.473
I don't know.

23:26.506 --> 23:28.708
I still think Jewish
and Filipino is the best mix.

23:28.741 --> 23:32.144
All right, Paula, come on,
we got to get back to work.

23:32.178 --> 23:34.614
I mean, Nigerian and
Greek is a close second.

23:34.647 --> 23:37.550
Oh, God, that's
a beautiful baby.
Baby.

23:37.584 --> 23:39.552
(in baby voice):
Oh, look at the baby.
Aw, they're so nice.

23:39.586 --> 23:42.455
With that little face.
Oh, my God, I want that,
like, in my womb.

23:42.489 --> 23:43.890
PAULA:
 You know, there are places
 that will do that.

23:47.093 --> 23:48.194
Paula!

23:48.227 --> 23:49.662
What!
Whoa.

23:49.696 --> 23:51.030
Oh, you okay?

23:51.063 --> 23:52.699
You're fine.
Yeah, nope,
good, good, good.

23:52.732 --> 23:54.066
Okay, I found...
What?
I found something.

23:54.100 --> 23:55.001
Call Darryl right now.

23:55.034 --> 23:57.069
This will get Josh back
on board the case,

23:57.103 --> 23:58.705
then we can spend
more time together.

24:04.511 --> 24:05.545
(pounding on door)
Josh.

24:05.578 --> 24:06.913
Oh.

24:06.946 --> 24:08.247
W-w-w-w-w-wait, I-I-I have news.

24:08.280 --> 24:09.248
Where is Josh?

24:09.281 --> 24:10.750
Josh isn't here,

24:10.783 --> 24:12.919
and it doesn't
matter anyway.

24:12.952 --> 24:14.654
I'm on to you now.

24:14.687 --> 24:17.089
I know you're full of it,
and now I have proof.

24:17.123 --> 24:18.558
Huh, what are you
talking about?

24:30.970 --> 24:33.573
Hey, Greg.
What do you mean, proof?

24:33.606 --> 24:34.574
Tell her, Greg.

24:34.607 --> 24:36.743
I, um, I looked it up,

24:36.776 --> 24:38.210
and I read some
stuff online

24:38.244 --> 24:40.747
about local tenant laws
capping settlements.

24:40.780 --> 24:42.615
Okay, I don't really
understand all of it.

24:42.649 --> 24:44.116
Dude, are we not
friends anymore?

24:44.150 --> 24:45.552
Like, are you mad at me?

24:45.585 --> 24:47.587
Because, and correct me
if I'm wrong,

24:47.620 --> 24:50.823
it seems like you're scheming
behind my back with Valencia.

24:52.592 --> 24:55.127
Wow.

24:55.161 --> 24:56.629
I'm sorry,
don't you have a life?

24:56.663 --> 24:57.897
Don't you have a girlfriend?

24:57.930 --> 25:01.067
I just think there's
something... not right.

25:01.100 --> 25:02.702
There's a
wrongness here.

25:02.735 --> 25:04.170
(Josh panting)

25:04.203 --> 25:05.972
JOSH:
Whoa.

25:06.005 --> 25:07.239
what's everyone
doing here?

25:07.273 --> 25:08.641
Oh, my God, what
are you doing here?

25:08.675 --> 25:10.610
Oh, we just went
on a run, dude.

25:11.844 --> 25:12.912
Will someone tell me

25:12.945 --> 25:14.246
what's going on here?

25:14.280 --> 25:16.816
(all talking at once)

25:16.849 --> 25:18.818
Joshy. Joshy.
Josh, Josh.
Don't listen to her.

25:18.851 --> 25:20.720
(all talking at once)

25:20.753 --> 25:21.821
What?

25:21.854 --> 25:24.190
(shouting):
Everyone, listen to Cookie!

25:26.759 --> 25:28.060
She-she calls me Cookie.

25:28.094 --> 25:30.229
Okay, so...

25:30.262 --> 25:33.165
I figured out if I can switch
the case to a county court,

25:33.199 --> 25:35.034
I can take advantage
of a tax loophole

25:35.067 --> 25:36.603
in the assessment tax codes.

25:38.805 --> 25:41.040
Let me sum it up.

25:41.073 --> 25:43.209
If you get your
whole building to sign up,

25:43.242 --> 25:44.844
I can get you a crap ton
of dough.

25:44.877 --> 25:45.945
PAULA:
She's right.

25:45.978 --> 25:47.146
In a suit like this,

25:47.179 --> 25:49.048
the payout can be huge.

25:49.081 --> 25:50.316
In Arizona,
the tenants got

25:50.349 --> 25:53.853
$10 million in an asbestos
liability dispute.

25:53.886 --> 25:55.121
Or we can call
one plumber

25:55.154 --> 25:56.288
and no one has
to go to court.

25:57.289 --> 25:58.224
Shut up, Greg.

25:58.257 --> 25:59.859
Josh, listen,

25:59.892 --> 26:00.860
I need your help to get everyone

26:00.893 --> 26:01.861
in this building onboard.

26:01.894 --> 26:03.763
We can do this.

26:03.796 --> 26:05.264
This is your moment.

26:05.297 --> 26:07.800
This is your decision.

26:07.834 --> 26:08.868
What do you say?

26:08.901 --> 26:11.003
Please, at least
just discuss it.

26:11.037 --> 26:12.939
There is nothing
to discuss.

26:12.972 --> 26:14.273
Okay, we don't
even know our neighbors,

26:14.306 --> 26:15.241
and they clearly
are not interested

26:15.274 --> 26:16.308
in making any money.

26:16.342 --> 26:17.944
Don't you get it?

26:17.977 --> 26:19.345
We're just not interested.

26:20.379 --> 26:22.782
(sighs)

26:22.815 --> 26:26.018
Josh, if I get everyone else
in the building to sign up,

26:26.052 --> 26:27.219
will you join?

26:32.424 --> 26:34.326
Don't do it.

26:38.898 --> 26:40.933
Josh, I...

26:49.275 --> 26:51.744
Bye.

26:53.212 --> 26:56.015
Wow, that is
a big bummer.

26:56.048 --> 26:58.350
No.

26:58.384 --> 27:00.653
Not a bummer at all.

27:00.687 --> 27:01.888
Come on, guys.

27:01.921 --> 27:03.255
Yeah, but she said
the neighbors won't...

27:03.289 --> 27:04.290
You are Darryl Whitefeather.

27:04.323 --> 27:05.391
And your people

27:05.424 --> 27:07.126
have been through a lot worse

27:07.159 --> 27:09.095
than some emaciated
yoga teacher, am I right?

27:09.128 --> 27:10.262
What do you mean, my people?

27:10.296 --> 27:12.264
Chippewa, Darryl.

27:12.298 --> 27:13.933
Oh, yes. Yes, yes, yes.

27:13.966 --> 27:15.301
Those people.
Right, right, right.

27:15.334 --> 27:16.368
Follow my lead.

27:16.402 --> 27:18.304
(baby jabbers)

27:18.337 --> 27:20.673
Hello, ma'am, my name is
Rebecca Bunch, Esquire,

27:20.707 --> 27:21.941
and these are
my legal associates.

27:21.974 --> 27:23.075
Hello.

27:23.109 --> 27:24.944
Tell me, is your
hot water out?

27:24.977 --> 27:26.312
Yeah, but they said
they're going to fix it...

27:26.345 --> 27:27.947
May I speak to you
for a moment

27:27.980 --> 27:29.315
about an
important issue?

27:29.348 --> 27:30.950
A serious problem
threatening

27:30.983 --> 27:32.251
your right to
life, liberty

27:32.284 --> 27:34.020
and the pursuit
of happiness.
Um...

27:34.053 --> 27:35.254
She's right.

27:35.287 --> 27:36.155
It's a big-ass problem.

27:36.188 --> 27:37.256
Okay, sure.

27:37.289 --> 27:39.358
Wonderful.
*

27:39.391 --> 27:41.293
* There's nothing
I love more in life *

27:41.327 --> 27:43.229
* Than a scalding
hot shower *

27:43.262 --> 27:45.164
* It's the symbol
of human dignity *

27:45.197 --> 27:46.465
* That separates us
from the chimps *

27:46.498 --> 27:47.967
* Helps you scrub
off the sleep *

27:48.000 --> 27:49.335
* And scrub on the day

27:49.368 --> 27:51.137
* Or scrub off the day,
and scrub on the sleep *

27:51.170 --> 27:53.005
* Don't know if you're morning
or night shower people *

27:53.039 --> 27:54.841
* Whatever floats your boat

27:54.874 --> 27:56.408
* But where are your toddlers
gonna float their boats *

27:56.442 --> 27:58.277
* If all you have
is cold h20? *

27:58.310 --> 28:00.279
* That's two parts
hydrogen, one part oxygen *

28:00.312 --> 28:01.814
* And zero parts justice

28:01.848 --> 28:03.182
* Now I know
you're thinking *

28:03.215 --> 28:04.350
* "What are you
talking about? *

28:04.383 --> 28:05.952
* Go away, this is
private property" *

28:05.985 --> 28:07.887
* Well, before we leave,
ladies and gents *

28:07.920 --> 28:10.189
* Allow me to set
the scene: ima... *

28:10.222 --> 28:11.257
Yeah, I don't live here.

28:11.290 --> 28:12.391
Oh.

28:12.424 --> 28:14.226
* Imagine your kids

28:14.260 --> 28:16.195
* Taking a shower
before they go to school *

28:16.228 --> 28:18.330
* They douse their skin
with ice cold water *

28:18.364 --> 28:20.299
* A huge shock to their
little systems *

28:20.332 --> 28:22.101
* At first it's downright
unpleasant, but then *

28:22.134 --> 28:23.870
* It gets them wired
in a way they've never felt *

28:23.903 --> 28:25.772
* And they think to themselves,
"That shower felt great" *

28:25.805 --> 28:27.740
* "Maybe I'll
try cocaine" *

28:27.774 --> 28:29.275
* So your son's on coke,
your daughter's pregnant *

28:29.308 --> 28:30.442
* And your husband's probably

28:30.476 --> 28:32.444
* Having an affair,
apocalypse *

28:32.478 --> 28:34.213
* Just like the movie
 I Am Legend *

28:34.246 --> 28:36.082
* But not like
that at all *

28:36.115 --> 28:37.416
* No hot water

28:37.449 --> 28:39.819
* Which means cold showers

28:39.852 --> 28:42.922
* Next thing you know,
your kids will be on crack *

28:42.955 --> 28:44.891
* No hot water

28:44.924 --> 28:46.358
* Which means
cold showers *

28:46.392 --> 28:48.294
* Which everyone knows

28:48.327 --> 28:49.428
* Is the gateway drug to crack

28:49.461 --> 28:50.930
* Crack, crack, crack

28:50.963 --> 28:52.464
* Crack, crack, crack, crack *

28:52.498 --> 28:54.166
Now, it's not just about
the hot water, folks

28:54.200 --> 28:55.802
* Crack, crack, crack, crack *

28:55.835 --> 28:57.303
If this landlord isn't taking
one measly hour

28:57.336 --> 28:58.938
out of his day
to fix your showers,

28:58.971 --> 29:00.472
then what's
this scumbag doing

29:00.506 --> 29:01.941
with all your
hard earned cash?

29:01.974 --> 29:02.474
He's taking it and blowing it
* Crack, crack, crack, crack *

29:02.508 --> 29:04.010
in a hand of Pai Gow

29:04.043 --> 29:05.477
at the Indian casino.

29:05.511 --> 29:06.412
(all gasp)
* Crack, crack, crack *

29:06.445 --> 29:08.014
He's fat-catting it

29:08.047 --> 29:09.816
at fancy restaurants
like The Olive Garden.

29:09.849 --> 29:11.317
(all gasp)
* Crack, crack, crack, crack *

29:11.350 --> 29:12.451
And Red Lobster.

29:12.484 --> 29:14.320
(all gasp)
Gasp is right.

29:14.353 --> 29:16.355
* That's gasp with
an uppercase "G" *

29:16.388 --> 29:18.891
* That ends with "P"
the first letter in pool *

29:18.925 --> 29:20.059
* No hot water *

29:20.092 --> 29:20.893
* No hot water

29:20.927 --> 29:22.228
* Which means cold showers *

29:23.262 --> 29:24.496
* Next thing you know

29:24.530 --> 29:25.464
* Your kids will be on crack

29:25.497 --> 29:27.066
* This makes sense *

29:27.099 --> 29:28.200
* No hot water *

29:28.234 --> 29:30.336
* Means cold, cold showers *

29:30.369 --> 29:32.504
* And cold showers are *

29:32.538 --> 29:33.940
* The gateway drug *

29:33.973 --> 29:36.475
* to crack *

29:36.508 --> 29:37.476
* Cold water is drugs *

29:37.509 --> 29:38.978
* Yeah! *

29:40.546 --> 29:43.349
Let's make ourselves a case,
folks!

29:43.382 --> 29:44.984
(cheering)

29:47.253 --> 29:48.520
Can I get one of these?

29:48.554 --> 29:49.521
DARRYL:
Absolutely, here you go.

29:49.555 --> 29:52.558
(people chattering)

29:55.561 --> 29:56.562
(sighs)

29:56.595 --> 29:58.965
Josh, I got
everyone on board.

29:58.998 --> 30:00.199
What do you say?

30:00.232 --> 30:02.468
Don't let her
manipulate you.

30:02.501 --> 30:03.936
Yeah, you're too
smart for this.

30:03.970 --> 30:05.171
Is he?

30:15.614 --> 30:20.319
(singsong):
Josh and I are gonna spend
a lot of time together today.

30:20.352 --> 30:23.089
(Rebecca humming)

30:23.122 --> 30:24.190
Josh is here.

30:24.223 --> 30:25.491
Oh.
Josh is here.

30:25.524 --> 30:26.458
Okay.
Here, no,
let the girls out.

30:26.492 --> 30:27.459
There we go.

30:27.493 --> 30:28.861
Okay, fluff them up.

30:28.895 --> 30:30.930
Oh, okay.
Get-get them up there.
Oh, God...

30:30.963 --> 30:32.464
See, people think they're fake,
but when you get up close,

30:32.498 --> 30:34.466
you realize no human
could design these.

30:34.500 --> 30:36.936
Oh, thank you.

30:36.969 --> 30:38.570
People think they're fake?

30:41.373 --> 30:43.075
Gym business.

30:43.109 --> 30:45.344
Ah.
White Joshua,
I just wanted to inform you

30:45.377 --> 30:47.013
that I am not going
to be training with you anymore.

30:47.046 --> 30:48.047
In the future,

30:48.080 --> 30:49.882
my fitness will be coming here,

30:49.916 --> 30:52.184
courtesy of the
cardio mambo class.

30:52.218 --> 30:56.022
Here, we leave our sneakers and
our assumptions by the door.

30:56.055 --> 30:57.056
Well, near the door.

30:57.089 --> 30:58.357
In the little cubbies.

30:58.390 --> 31:00.192
Cool, cool, cool.

31:00.226 --> 31:01.427
No better way to prove
to yourself you're straight

31:01.460 --> 31:03.395
than a barefoot,
cardio mambo class.

31:05.397 --> 31:06.632
Nothing to prove.

31:06.665 --> 31:08.000
Tanya, want to stretch?

31:08.034 --> 31:09.435
Last time, guys.

31:09.468 --> 31:11.137
*

31:11.170 --> 31:13.539
Right.

31:14.573 --> 31:16.342
Getting sweaty, guys.

31:16.375 --> 31:18.444
And squeeze.

31:18.477 --> 31:24.150
*

31:34.226 --> 31:36.628
Squeeze, and squeeze, and hop.

31:36.662 --> 31:40.432
And... squeeze.

31:40.466 --> 31:42.401
And squeeze, again.

31:45.171 --> 31:46.605
Big finish.

31:46.638 --> 31:48.307
Now, pose.

31:48.340 --> 31:50.709
Oh, my God, could I be...

31:50.742 --> 31:52.278
WOMAN: Bye.
WOMAN 2: Bye.

31:52.311 --> 31:53.479
MAN: Bye.
MAN 2: Bye.

31:53.512 --> 31:54.513
Bye.
Bye.

31:54.546 --> 31:55.714
You're bi, Darryl.

31:55.747 --> 31:56.548
What?

31:56.582 --> 31:59.185
I said, yerba maté tea.

31:59.218 --> 32:00.519
Mmm, I want one.

32:00.552 --> 32:01.954
(laughs softly)

32:06.492 --> 32:07.459
Oh, my gosh, you can
draw that upside down?

32:07.493 --> 32:09.228
Isn't that weird?

32:09.261 --> 32:10.429
That's like really good.
I'm like-I'm like amazing.

32:10.462 --> 32:12.464
Oh, thank you
very much
Oh.

32:12.498 --> 32:14.300
Josh, would you like
flat or bubbles?

32:14.333 --> 32:15.734
Oh, uh, no bubbles.

32:15.767 --> 32:17.469
Uh, they give me dem burps.

32:17.503 --> 32:19.705
(Rebecca laughs)

32:19.738 --> 32:21.407
(both laugh)

32:21.440 --> 32:22.474
Oh...

32:22.508 --> 32:24.076
Anyway, we should get, um,

32:24.110 --> 32:25.744
back to the zoning ordinances.

32:25.777 --> 32:27.279
So, uh, the next
thing to do

32:27.313 --> 32:28.614
is file this paperwork
with the city.

32:28.647 --> 32:30.316
But more importantly,
we have to decide what

32:30.349 --> 32:32.018
we're eating for dinner tonight.
I'm starving.

32:32.051 --> 32:34.253
All right, let's see...

32:34.286 --> 32:36.422
So, yesterday we
had Middle Eastern,

32:36.455 --> 32:37.623
this morning we had
boba delivered--

32:37.656 --> 32:39.325
I liked that a lot--

32:39.358 --> 32:40.759
And then we had Ethiopian...

32:40.792 --> 32:44.363
Yeah, this case
is gonna make us very...

32:44.396 --> 32:45.464
well-rounded.

32:45.497 --> 32:48.134
(laughs)

32:48.167 --> 32:49.435
(both laughing)
Well-rounded,
I love that.

32:49.468 --> 32:50.736
You like that?

32:50.769 --> 32:52.771
I'm having the best time.

32:52.804 --> 32:54.173
(laughing):
Yeah.

32:54.206 --> 32:55.441
Sorry, um, Rebecca,

32:55.474 --> 32:57.109
you have a call on line five.

32:57.143 --> 32:59.145
Hey, Paula, where's a good
Italian place around here,

32:59.178 --> 33:00.546
something, like, Northern.

33:00.579 --> 33:03.049
It's the landlord
from Josh's building.

33:03.082 --> 33:05.551
Oh. Oh, he must
be running scared.

33:05.584 --> 33:06.718
Okay, watch this, Josh.

33:06.752 --> 33:08.154
I'm gonna put
on my lawyer voice.

33:11.090 --> 33:13.492
Well, well, well,

33:13.525 --> 33:15.561
the day of reckoning
has arrived.

33:15.594 --> 33:16.595
Your reign

33:16.628 --> 33:19.231
of terror will soon be over,

33:19.265 --> 33:22.401
Mr. Edward B.
Greyson, and...

33:23.735 --> 33:25.104
What?

33:26.138 --> 33:27.373
(whispering):
What's wrong?

33:27.406 --> 33:28.640
(whispering):
Shh.

33:28.674 --> 33:30.609
(whispering):
Did we lose the case?

33:30.642 --> 33:34.446
(whispering):
We haven't been to court yet,
Pun'kin.

33:35.414 --> 33:37.549
(quietly):
Oh.

33:37.583 --> 33:41.653
Uh, I'm gonna have
to get back to you.

33:45.657 --> 33:48.594
He, um, he wants to settle.

33:48.627 --> 33:49.561
DARRYL:
Take it.

33:49.595 --> 33:51.230
Take it, take it, take it.

33:51.263 --> 33:52.631
Wha... how did you hear me?

33:52.664 --> 33:54.600
Oh, well, I had the little glass
against the wall.

33:54.633 --> 33:55.801
How much?
How much? How much?

33:55.834 --> 33:58.704
I mean, the amount
doesn't really matter.

33:58.737 --> 34:00.639
Uh, yeah, it does.
(laughs)

34:00.672 --> 34:03.609
Fine, he-he was willing
to settle for a million.

34:03.642 --> 34:05.611
A million dollars?

34:05.644 --> 34:08.780
We each get $1 million?

34:08.813 --> 34:10.516
No, Pun'kin,
it's got to be spread out

34:10.549 --> 34:11.683
amongst all the litigants,

34:11.717 --> 34:13.252
but still, it's-it comes
to comes to, like,

34:13.284 --> 34:14.686
10,00 bucks
each, right?

34:14.719 --> 34:16.554
Huzzah!

34:16.588 --> 34:18.424
This case is over.

34:19.658 --> 34:21.159
Yeah, I'm gonna turn it down.

34:21.193 --> 34:22.561
What?
What?

34:22.594 --> 34:23.329
What?

34:23.362 --> 34:25.331
George.

34:25.364 --> 34:26.632
Oh.
We talked about this.

34:26.665 --> 34:28.400
Sorry.

34:28.434 --> 34:30.802
I know.

34:30.835 --> 34:34.206
Guys, don't worry,
I know exactly what I'm doing.

34:34.239 --> 34:36.574
Just let me think
about this for a second.

34:36.608 --> 34:38.377
Paula, come into my office.

34:40.545 --> 34:42.514
Paula, this case
can't be over,

34:42.547 --> 34:44.583
because Josh and I
are having the best time.

34:44.616 --> 34:46.452
Like, today we put popcorn
in the microwave,

34:46.485 --> 34:47.753
and then he showed
me how to put

34:47.786 --> 34:48.687
parmesan and garlic
flakes on it,

34:48.719 --> 34:50.822
and we made, like,
an Italian popcorn thing,

34:50.856 --> 34:52.690
and it was, like,
the best thing I've ever had, so

34:52.724 --> 34:53.859
I'm gonna figure something out,
I'm gonna figure something out.

34:53.891 --> 34:55.726
Okay, babe, babe, babe,
you're spiraling.

34:55.761 --> 34:58.330
(inhales and exhales loudly)

34:59.698 --> 35:01.500
(whispering):
Let me think, let me think.

35:02.934 --> 35:05.737
That landlord would not
have ponied up

35:05.771 --> 35:07.373
such a big settlement offer

35:07.406 --> 35:08.807
if there wasn't something
under this.

35:08.840 --> 35:10.209
Something's going on.

35:10.242 --> 35:12.311
Something with the water
in this city.

35:12.344 --> 35:13.479
And I'm going to
figure out what it is.

35:13.512 --> 35:14.780
How are you going to do that?

35:17.516 --> 35:21.653
(echoing):
 Water conspiracy, water
 conspiracy, water conspiracy.

35:21.687 --> 35:23.655
Where in town can I buy
fly-fishing equipment?

35:23.689 --> 35:24.790
What?
Just answer me.

35:24.823 --> 35:26.692
Purely Sports on East Cameron.

35:26.725 --> 35:28.494
Great.

35:30.829 --> 35:32.764
I really have to talk to you.
We're not gonna settle?

35:32.798 --> 35:34.166
What are we going to do?

35:34.200 --> 35:35.701
Rebecca, we really
need that money.

35:35.734 --> 35:37.569
I'm going to make
you more money.
What?

35:37.603 --> 35:39.471
Darryl, how does your ass feel?

35:39.505 --> 35:40.472
What?

35:40.506 --> 35:41.740
Come with me.

35:46.678 --> 35:48.747
I don't know why we had
to meet in a garage.

35:48.780 --> 35:49.648
I need your help.

35:49.681 --> 35:50.849
You're the only one

35:50.882 --> 35:52.184
who sees through Rebecca
like I do.

35:52.218 --> 35:53.852
What do you want me to do?

35:53.885 --> 35:55.687
I can't prove she's lying.

35:55.721 --> 35:56.788
That's okay.

35:56.822 --> 35:59.425
I have evidence
that she's lying.

35:59.458 --> 36:01.460
Look at this.

36:03.862 --> 36:04.863
I'm telling you.

36:04.896 --> 36:06.932
That bitch cray.

36:08.267 --> 36:10.402
Tell him, Bert.

36:10.436 --> 36:12.338
The Los Angeles
county water system

36:12.371 --> 36:13.805
is a complex creature.

36:13.839 --> 36:15.907
Now, we're surrounded by water,
of course,

36:15.941 --> 36:18.844
but until those Israelis learn
out how to desalinate,

36:18.877 --> 36:20.579
we're up crap's creek,

36:20.612 --> 36:22.881
scrabbling around buying
water from Colorado.

36:22.914 --> 36:24.783
You look confused,
let me explain.

36:24.816 --> 36:26.418
So, Bert is a...

36:26.452 --> 36:28.454
disgruntled...
ex-utility employee,

36:28.487 --> 36:29.821
Very much.
who's the leader
of a group

36:29.855 --> 36:31.423
of water
conspiracy theorists

36:31.457 --> 36:32.958
known as the Water Truthers.

36:32.991 --> 36:34.626
I dismissed him at first,

36:34.660 --> 36:35.894
as I do most
conspiracy theories,

36:35.927 --> 36:37.529
but I looked into it,
and, well...

36:37.563 --> 36:38.530
his theories hold water.

36:38.564 --> 36:40.932
Damn straight
they do!

36:40.966 --> 36:43.001
We're here.
Where?

36:43.034 --> 36:45.771
This manhole here is a
secret, central entrance

36:45.804 --> 36:47.906
which leads down
into the entire system.

36:47.939 --> 36:49.508
Watch your toes.
Ooh.

36:49.541 --> 36:54.446
(Bert grunting)

36:54.480 --> 36:57.316
So, this is like...

36:57.349 --> 36:58.784
the vagina of the system.

36:58.817 --> 37:00.386
It's a manhole.

37:00.419 --> 37:03.722
So, this manhole
is a vagina.

37:03.755 --> 37:05.991
You're saying a lot
of crazy stuff.

37:06.024 --> 37:08.394
Now come on,
let's see how

37:08.427 --> 37:10.496
the corporate illuminati
control liquid.

37:17.035 --> 37:18.304
This here is
the central

37:18.337 --> 37:20.038
switching station
for West Covina.

37:20.071 --> 37:21.473
Now, as you can see,
some of these pipes,

37:21.507 --> 37:22.574
like this one here,

37:22.608 --> 37:24.476
is being siphoned off.

37:24.510 --> 37:26.745
That means that there's
a lack of water pressure,

37:26.778 --> 37:29.448
which causes water heaters
to underperform,

37:29.481 --> 37:30.749
since they're
only triggered

37:30.782 --> 37:33.051
at a certain
pound-per-square-inch number.

37:33.084 --> 37:34.786
It's the age-old trick.

37:34.820 --> 37:36.555
You steal a little bit
from everybody,

37:36.588 --> 37:38.490
nobody notices...

37:38.524 --> 37:39.458
except ol' Bert here.

37:39.491 --> 37:40.726
These pipes were

37:40.759 --> 37:42.994
designed to supply water
throughout the county,

37:43.028 --> 37:44.496
so they go both ways.

37:44.530 --> 37:46.898
Both ways.
Interesting.

37:46.932 --> 37:47.899
Yeah, but as
you can see from

37:47.933 --> 37:50.336
this gauge right here,
the water's being forced

37:50.369 --> 37:51.537
to go only one way.

37:51.570 --> 37:52.738
Well, that's not fair.

37:52.771 --> 37:54.506
Exactly.

37:54.540 --> 37:55.841
The water in these pipes
want to go every which way.

37:55.874 --> 37:58.610
Yes, yes, it does,
and it has every right to.

37:58.644 --> 38:00.579
You're really into this water,
Darryl.

38:00.612 --> 38:02.781
Well, I'm fascinated.
Okay.

38:02.814 --> 38:06.084
The water is being diverted away
from the San Gabriel Valley

38:06.117 --> 38:07.653
and towards Los Angeles.

38:07.686 --> 38:09.555
Wait, but who
would do that?

38:09.588 --> 38:11.757
They're called
Greater City Water,

38:11.790 --> 38:14.526
a conglomerate
of utility companies,

38:14.560 --> 38:16.662
reservoirs and aqueduct owners

38:16.695 --> 38:18.530
working in cahoots
with local landlords.

38:18.564 --> 38:21.099
S-so, you're saying...

38:21.132 --> 38:23.835
I'm saying that it's not
just about one landlord,

38:23.869 --> 38:25.404
it's about the entire

38:25.437 --> 38:27.406
San Gabriel Valley
being exploited

38:27.439 --> 38:29.475
by a corporation worth billions.

38:29.508 --> 38:30.742
And if they're
worth billions,

38:30.776 --> 38:32.043
then they can be
sued for billions.

38:32.077 --> 38:33.445
Yes.

38:33.479 --> 38:34.580
(chuckles)

38:34.613 --> 38:36.915
And if they can be
sued for billions,

38:36.948 --> 38:39.785
then that means Josh and I
are gonna eat Peruvian,

38:39.818 --> 38:41.487
and Sicilian pizza

38:41.520 --> 38:43.054
at the poutine place.

38:43.088 --> 38:46.558
Ooh, at the Greek place,
at the mac and cheese place.

38:46.592 --> 38:47.626
There's a rib place,

38:47.659 --> 38:48.627
there's also a
good poke place.

38:48.660 --> 38:49.928
Anyway, oh, I should go.

38:49.961 --> 38:50.962
Me, too.

38:50.996 --> 38:52.398
Cool, I'm just gonna go

38:52.431 --> 38:53.965
back in my hole
and eat some rats.

39:03.074 --> 39:04.710
Uh, here we go.

39:04.743 --> 39:07.479
Hi.
Whoa, what are
you wearing?

39:07.513 --> 39:08.980
Fly-fishing gear.

39:09.014 --> 39:09.948
What are you wearing, dude?

39:09.981 --> 39:11.950
Oh, uh, fly-fishing gear.

39:11.983 --> 39:12.984
Okay, so, I found something out.

39:13.018 --> 39:14.720
I found something out.

39:14.753 --> 39:15.754
So did I.

39:20.926 --> 39:22.093
Trent?

39:23.995 --> 39:26.698
Now, it's true, I'm not gay.

39:26.732 --> 39:29.601
I, Darryl Whitefeather...

39:29.635 --> 39:31.570
I like both sexes.

39:31.603 --> 39:33.505
I'm a both sexual.

39:33.539 --> 39:36.174
Oh, God, it feels so good
to just say that out loud.

39:36.207 --> 39:38.710
The term is, uh, bisex...

39:39.711 --> 39:41.680
Mm.

39:43.114 --> 39:44.516
Bisexual.

39:44.550 --> 39:45.851
That was fun.

39:45.884 --> 39:48.854
Oh, Rebecca,
perfect timing.

39:48.887 --> 39:49.988
Trent just got here

39:50.021 --> 39:51.156
five seconds ago.

39:51.189 --> 39:53.659
Trent, baby.

40:03.969 --> 40:06.204
It's so good to see you.

40:06.237 --> 40:08.707
(squealing):
Oh, I'm so glad you're here.

40:08.740 --> 40:10.742
(Rebecca laughs awkwardly)

40:16.682 --> 40:17.849
(laughter)

40:17.883 --> 40:20.552
Okay, let's hear it
for window washer...

40:20.586 --> 40:22.788
ALL:
Gossip Fridays.

40:22.821 --> 40:24.756
Oh, wait, who has got
the biggest scoop

40:24.790 --> 40:25.691
from their work this week?

40:25.724 --> 40:27.125
Mm.
Oh, there's a prostitute

40:27.158 --> 40:29.127
breaking up marriages
all over town.

40:29.160 --> 40:31.129
Okay, well I've got more news
about Rebecca and Josh.

40:31.162 --> 40:32.964
Oh, my God, you mean
the crazy chick?

40:32.998 --> 40:35.667
Excuse me, where do you
get off calling her crazy?

40:35.701 --> 40:36.635
When Jerome broke
up with you,

40:36.668 --> 40:38.670
it wasn't
exactly Sane City.

40:38.704 --> 40:41.773
You left streaks
on every skyscraper in Burbank.

40:41.807 --> 40:42.974
(laughs)

40:43.008 --> 40:44.743
You said you'd never
mention that again.

40:44.776 --> 40:46.912
Guess not.
