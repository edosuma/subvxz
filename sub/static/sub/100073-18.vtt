WEBVTT

00:01.496 --> 00:05.020
7-Adam-15, show us
Code 6 at Shaw Memorial.

00:05.022 --> 00:06.112
What's going on?

00:06.114 --> 00:07.800
A guy came into the ER intoxicated,

00:07.802 --> 00:08.868
complaining of stomach pain.

00:08.870 --> 00:11.637
He's clearly been shot
but insisting he's not.

00:14.075 --> 00:15.975
Sir. I hear you're
having a little trouble.

00:15.977 --> 00:19.813
Uh, no, just, um, ate some bad sushi.

00:19.815 --> 00:21.580
- What's your name?
- Arnold.

00:21.582 --> 00:22.748
Arnold what?

00:22.750 --> 00:24.517
I-I don't have to tell you that.

00:24.519 --> 00:26.352
Hey, why... why'd you call them?

00:26.354 --> 00:27.653
Sir, she's required by law

00:27.655 --> 00:29.088
to call us when a patient's been shot.

00:29.090 --> 00:30.690
I told you, I ain't been shot.

00:30.692 --> 00:33.492
Just too much gas station sushi.

00:33.494 --> 00:34.760
Well, unless the wasabi

00:34.762 --> 00:36.529
burned a hole straight
through your stomach,

00:36.531 --> 00:37.930
I'm forced to assume you're lying to us.

00:37.932 --> 00:39.832
So, how about you tell
us what really happened?

00:39.834 --> 00:41.590
Um...

00:41.592 --> 00:43.382
Uh...

00:43.384 --> 00:45.004
He did it!

00:45.006 --> 00:47.874
That's my husband. What... Excuse me.

00:47.876 --> 00:49.675
What's going on? Why are you here?

00:55.350 --> 00:56.783
Nolan! Hey!

00:58.019 --> 01:00.387
Hey, hey, hey!

01:01.522 --> 01:03.889
Aah! Hey! Careful, man.

01:03.891 --> 01:05.447
I been shot!

01:05.449 --> 01:06.938
You gonna run away again?

01:06.940 --> 01:08.730
- No.
- You got him?

01:08.732 --> 01:10.496
Aah!

01:10.498 --> 01:11.864
Get him an IV antibiotic,

01:11.866 --> 01:14.667
and add 5 milligrams of lorazepam.

01:14.669 --> 01:16.068
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, no, yeah, fine.

01:16.070 --> 01:18.037
No, I just... I was...
I got, uh, distracted.

01:18.039 --> 01:19.473
Oh, by what?

01:20.875 --> 01:23.376
Simon, this is Nyla Harper

01:23.378 --> 01:25.979
and... John Nolan.

01:27.715 --> 01:29.482
Uh, nice to meet you, Officers.

01:29.484 --> 01:30.716
You must spend a lot of time here.

01:30.718 --> 01:31.917
Oh, he's here all the time.

01:31.919 --> 01:33.586
Get... Got... Well, the criminals

01:33.588 --> 01:37.156
and the injury... it's constant stuff.

01:37.158 --> 01:39.925
Oh. W-Well, it's nice to meet you both.

01:43.531 --> 01:45.898
Hey.

01:45.900 --> 01:47.656
Dispatch said you got a gunshot victim.

01:47.658 --> 01:48.680
Yeah, he belong to you?

01:48.682 --> 01:50.069
Unfortunately, yeah.

01:50.071 --> 01:51.203
Guy ate all the sushi

01:51.205 --> 01:53.172
at a gas station on Melrose and Fairfax

01:53.174 --> 01:54.607
and refused to pay.

01:54.609 --> 01:56.575
Things got heated. The owner shot him.

01:56.577 --> 01:58.611
Who's the dude close-talking with Grace?

01:58.613 --> 01:59.945
That's her husband.

01:59.947 --> 02:01.514
I thought she was divorced.

02:01.516 --> 02:02.516
Not technically.

02:03.951 --> 02:05.050
What?

02:05.052 --> 02:06.175
- Nothing.
- Nothing.

02:17.211 --> 02:19.765
I forgot my deodorant again.

02:19.767 --> 02:21.801
Here. Use mine.

02:21.803 --> 02:23.569
Oh.

02:23.571 --> 02:25.591
I do love a manly musk.

02:25.593 --> 02:27.460
Just not on me.

02:27.462 --> 02:30.263
You're gonna have to start
leaving some things here.

02:30.265 --> 02:31.464
Yeah?

02:31.466 --> 02:32.531
Yeah.

02:34.535 --> 02:36.035
What?

02:36.037 --> 02:37.102
Nothing.

02:37.104 --> 02:39.473
You know it's illegal to lie to a cop.

02:40.808 --> 02:42.775
Last week,

02:42.777 --> 02:47.580
I interviewed for my dream job and...

02:47.582 --> 02:49.282
I got it.

02:49.284 --> 02:52.051
Hey, hey! That's great!

02:52.053 --> 02:53.887
It's in New York.

02:54.956 --> 02:56.455
Oh.

02:56.457 --> 02:57.890
Yeah.

03:01.929 --> 03:04.463
Well, I s... I mean,
y-you have to take it.

03:04.465 --> 03:06.999
Dream jobs only come around once.

03:07.001 --> 03:08.934
Yeah, I know.

03:11.806 --> 03:13.939
When do you start?

03:13.941 --> 03:15.575
Next month.

03:17.312 --> 03:20.514
They have cops in New York.

03:23.651 --> 03:24.751
Yeah.

03:28.089 --> 03:30.423
Do you know where you're gonna live?

03:31.826 --> 03:33.659
Not yet.

03:33.661 --> 03:35.428
Maybe you could, um,

03:35.430 --> 03:38.097
help me target some
neighborhoods tonight.

03:39.667 --> 03:41.334
Yeah.

03:41.336 --> 03:42.501
Sure.

03:43.838 --> 03:45.248
We're skipping roll call today.

03:45.250 --> 03:46.839
Grey's got us on special assignment.

03:46.841 --> 03:49.342
- Sounds cool and mysterious.
- Negative.

03:49.344 --> 03:51.344
We will be escorting
some juvenile felons

03:51.346 --> 03:53.979
through a Scared Straight
program at Cal Correctional.

03:53.981 --> 03:55.981
Oh, and let me guess...
you'd rather be on the streets

03:55.983 --> 03:57.783
- chasing real criminals.
- Yep.

03:57.785 --> 03:59.518
I've been to these things before.

03:59.520 --> 04:01.730
It's a lot of chaos and noise...
and the jury's still out

04:01.732 --> 04:03.162
as to whether it actually
makes a difference.

04:03.164 --> 04:05.324
Well, if it helps even one
kid, it's made a difference.

04:07.995 --> 04:09.128
This is... I...

04:09.130 --> 04:10.696
Meet me at the Sally Port.

04:10.698 --> 04:12.798
Thank you.

04:12.800 --> 04:14.467
Hey, you. How you doing?

04:14.469 --> 04:15.568
Not great.

04:15.570 --> 04:17.470
Oliver is in some trouble at school.

04:17.471 --> 04:19.038
That's why Simon was here yesterday.

04:19.040 --> 04:20.206
Sorry to hear that.

04:20.208 --> 04:22.475
- ICU Nurse Adams to recovery.
- Thanks.

04:22.477 --> 04:23.576
You know, and I'm sorry

04:23.578 --> 04:26.579
that it was awkward meeting my ex.

04:26.581 --> 04:28.414
You know, it just didn't feel
like the right time or place

04:28.416 --> 04:30.015
to introduce you as my boyfriend.

04:30.017 --> 04:31.851
- I understand.
- I knew you would.

04:31.853 --> 04:33.486
Like I know you'll understand

04:33.488 --> 04:36.589
that I need to reschedule
dinner tonight.

04:36.591 --> 04:38.390
I think Simon and I have got
to get on the same page

04:38.392 --> 04:39.892
about how to handle Oliver.

04:39.894 --> 04:41.560
Over dinner?

04:41.562 --> 04:45.064
I mean, it's the only
time he can get off work.

04:45.066 --> 04:46.866
Yeah, right. Of... Of course, yeah.

04:46.868 --> 04:48.934
And family comes first.

04:48.936 --> 04:52.071
Um, I have to go right now,
but I will talk to you later.

04:52.073 --> 04:53.739
You got a problem.

04:53.741 --> 04:56.075
- Both of us?
- No, just you.

04:56.077 --> 04:57.576
In the attempt to combat

04:57.578 --> 04:59.578
the high cost of civil litigation,

04:59.580 --> 05:02.448
the LAPD has adopted a pilot program

05:02.450 --> 05:03.916
which uses an algorithm

05:03.918 --> 05:07.052
to target officers who are
most likely to get sued.

05:07.054 --> 05:08.344
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

05:08.346 --> 05:10.055
They hired a tech company

05:10.057 --> 05:12.591
run by a supposed genius...

05:12.593 --> 05:13.692
Elvis Grimaldi.

05:13.694 --> 05:16.028
All due respect, why do we
care what this dude thinks?

05:16.030 --> 05:17.730
Because he flagged you

05:17.732 --> 05:20.599
as the most problematic
officer in this station,

05:20.601 --> 05:21.867
and he's got the Chief's ear.

05:21.869 --> 05:23.702
Come on, Sarge. I just
got the tap for detective.

05:23.704 --> 05:25.704
I'll get passed over
if this guy dings me.

05:25.706 --> 05:29.041
Which is why I got him to
agree to spend a day with you,

05:29.043 --> 05:32.211
collect more data for his "algorithm".

05:32.213 --> 05:35.250
So you are going to show him

05:35.252 --> 05:38.484
you are a by-the-book cop
with love in her heart.

05:38.486 --> 05:40.038
Take only the tame calls,

05:40.040 --> 05:42.908
and give him the answers
he wants to hear.

05:43.991 --> 05:46.158
You might just skate through this thing.

05:46.160 --> 05:48.127
Alright, line up. Against the van.

05:50.131 --> 05:54.033
Marco Leland... assault and battery.

05:54.035 --> 05:55.134
Tyson Renner...

05:55.136 --> 05:56.168
Hey, unh-unh.

05:56.170 --> 05:58.604
Up. Off the van. Stand up straight.

05:58.606 --> 06:00.973
Tyson Renner... vandalism.

06:00.975 --> 06:02.641
Fletcher Perry... auto...

06:02.643 --> 06:05.177
Auto theft. That turn you on, baby?

06:05.179 --> 06:07.813
Nothing like getting hit on
by a 12-year-old delinquent

06:07.815 --> 06:08.981
to get your day started.

06:08.983 --> 06:10.249
Hey, yo, I'm 15.

06:10.251 --> 06:11.684
Not better.

06:11.686 --> 06:13.586
What about you? What's your story?

06:15.122 --> 06:16.288
Okay, good talk.

06:16.290 --> 06:17.976
Hector Duran, 17.

06:17.978 --> 06:21.260
Spent three months in juvie
for theft and drug possession.

06:21.262 --> 06:24.418
Okay. I'm Officer Nolan.
This is Detective Harper.

06:24.420 --> 06:25.987
Together, we're gonna be
taking a little field trip

06:25.989 --> 06:28.634
down to the California
Correctional Facility.

06:28.636 --> 06:30.603
For those of you who
complete today's program,

06:30.605 --> 06:32.671
the rest of your sentences
will be commuted.

06:32.673 --> 06:34.006
But this is your last chance.

06:34.008 --> 06:36.370
Get busted again, and
the prison we are going to

06:36.372 --> 06:37.843
will become your new home.

06:37.845 --> 06:38.866
Fine by me.

06:38.868 --> 06:40.112
Really? You ever been there?

06:40.114 --> 06:41.137
Hell yeah.

06:41.139 --> 06:42.681
My brother's doing a bid up there.

06:42.683 --> 06:44.117
Not something to be proud of.

06:45.786 --> 06:47.720
Alright. Road trip time.

06:49.323 --> 06:51.023
So, I made some calls.

06:51.025 --> 06:52.859
This Grimaldi guy made a fortune

06:52.861 --> 06:54.326
on a dating app that he sold to Google.

06:54.328 --> 06:56.016
Claims his algorithm is so good

06:56.018 --> 06:57.393
that it can predict compatibility

06:57.395 --> 06:58.898
with a 90% success rate.

06:58.900 --> 06:59.999
Bull.

07:00.001 --> 07:03.168
Maybe. But rumor is Bieber
used it to land Hailey.

07:03.170 --> 07:05.037
I don't know who those people are.

07:06.207 --> 07:08.808
You the brain messing
with my livelihood?

07:09.644 --> 07:11.677
Mr. Grimaldi, I am Officer West.

07:11.679 --> 07:13.812
This is my training
officer, Officer Lopez.

07:13.814 --> 07:16.348
Call me Elvis. Mr. Grimaldi are my dads.

07:16.350 --> 07:18.050
You don't look as
dangerous as I anticipated.

07:18.052 --> 07:19.285
And you don't look as smart.

07:20.688 --> 07:22.154
Yeah, think I'm gonna go.

07:22.156 --> 07:23.430
You, um... You'll lose out

07:23.432 --> 07:25.357
on gathering more data
points for your algorithm,

07:25.359 --> 07:28.193
and that'll delay exiting
the beta phase by weeks.

07:28.195 --> 07:29.762
You understand about beta phases.

07:29.764 --> 07:30.863
Yes, sir.

07:30.865 --> 07:33.198
Officer Lopez taught me.

07:33.200 --> 07:36.235
Okay, I'm back in. Data uber alles.

07:36.237 --> 07:37.670
But, Officer Lopez, you should know

07:37.672 --> 07:38.837
that negativity towards me

07:38.839 --> 07:40.397
will only strengthen the core data draw

07:40.399 --> 07:42.159
that landed you the top
spot on the naughty list.

07:42.161 --> 07:43.876
I'll take that under advisement.

07:43.878 --> 07:45.611
Excellent. Shall we?

07:48.683 --> 07:50.317
Rachel told me about New York.

07:51.752 --> 07:53.218
I'm happy for her.

07:53.220 --> 07:54.587
What are you guys gonna do?

07:54.589 --> 07:56.221
There's not much to do.

07:56.223 --> 07:58.484
You know, it's... it's not
like it's a semester abroad.

07:58.486 --> 07:59.753
It's permanent.

08:00.895 --> 08:03.196
Long-distance relationships never work.

08:05.700 --> 08:07.032
Thanks for coming.

08:07.034 --> 08:08.801
Of course. What do you got?

08:08.803 --> 08:11.203
Uh, Social Services has
been here a few times

08:11.205 --> 08:12.304
on truancy calls.

08:12.306 --> 08:14.106
Paul hasn't been to
school in the last month

08:14.108 --> 08:16.241
due to an undefined illness,

08:16.243 --> 08:19.304
and the mom recently started a GoFundMe

08:19.306 --> 08:20.312
to cover the medical bills.

08:20.314 --> 08:22.414
Right. You think she's running a scam?

08:22.416 --> 08:24.249
Well, scams are your jurisdiction.

08:24.251 --> 08:26.118
I'm just here to make
sure the kid's okay.

08:28.289 --> 08:29.655
Hello, Ms. Mint?

08:29.657 --> 08:31.123
Hi, I'm Rachel Hall

08:31.125 --> 08:33.092
with the Department
of Child and Family Services.

08:33.094 --> 08:34.626
Uh, is this about the truancy?

08:34.629 --> 08:37.763
Yes. We just have a few
questions for you and your son.

08:37.765 --> 08:38.964
Uh, I'm... I'm sorry.

08:38.966 --> 08:40.666
It's not really a good
time. Paul's asleep.

08:40.668 --> 08:44.403
I understand, but my job
is to make sure he's okay.

08:44.405 --> 08:46.895
And I'm not leaving until I see him.

08:46.897 --> 08:47.919
I-I...

08:47.921 --> 08:49.241
Step aside, ma'am.

08:49.243 --> 08:51.410
I have a radio interview in 20 minutes.

08:51.412 --> 08:53.780
We'll be out of your way in 10.

08:59.654 --> 09:02.988
Paul? Honey?

09:02.990 --> 09:04.156
This is Rachel.

09:04.158 --> 09:07.026
She needs to talk to you, okay?

09:07.028 --> 09:09.696
Hi, Paul.

09:12.767 --> 09:15.000
Have you been to the doctor?

09:15.002 --> 09:16.503
He's been in and out of the hospital

09:16.505 --> 09:18.837
for the last three months.

09:18.839 --> 09:20.139
What's the diagnosis?

09:20.141 --> 09:22.174
"Results inconclusive",

09:22.176 --> 09:26.011
which is doctor for "We have no idea".

09:26.013 --> 09:27.446
Pulse is racing.

09:27.448 --> 09:30.950
Hey, Paul, can you squeeze my hand?

09:35.022 --> 09:36.722
They released him like this?

09:36.724 --> 09:39.191
No, he was better.

09:39.193 --> 09:40.325
It's always the same.

09:40.327 --> 09:41.646
He improves at the hospital,

09:41.648 --> 09:43.524
but after a couple days
at home, he's back to this.

09:43.526 --> 09:45.215
How am I supposed to send him to school?

09:45.217 --> 09:46.965
He can't even sit up.

09:46.967 --> 09:48.734
I understand.

09:48.736 --> 09:51.236
We'll be out of your
hair in just a minute.

09:56.377 --> 09:59.044
So, what do you think?
It's Munchausen by proxy?

09:59.046 --> 10:01.013
She meets the criteria.

10:01.015 --> 10:03.629
Attention-seeking, undiagnosable illness

10:03.631 --> 10:05.691
that gets better when
he's under observation.

10:05.693 --> 10:06.785
It's just so wrong

10:06.787 --> 10:09.956
that a parent would poison
their own child for attention.

10:11.092 --> 10:12.391
Alright, what do you want to do?

10:14.895 --> 10:18.230
$80,742,000.

10:18.232 --> 10:20.365
That how much you made
off your dating app?

10:20.367 --> 10:22.034
Oh, God, no. I made 10 times that.

10:22.036 --> 10:23.902
The $80 million is
how much the LAPD paid

10:23.904 --> 10:25.237
in legal settlements this year.

10:25.239 --> 10:26.839
That's up 3.25%,

10:26.841 --> 10:29.241
which is why they hired me
to target officers like you.

10:29.243 --> 10:31.343
You can't predict behavior with math.

10:31.345 --> 10:33.011
It's literally what I do.

10:33.013 --> 10:34.246
Policing is different.

10:34.248 --> 10:35.848
- I disagree.
- Of course you do.

10:35.850 --> 10:37.737
I find the whole subject fascinating.

10:37.739 --> 10:40.085
Uh, love to pick your brain.

10:40.087 --> 10:42.193
If you're such an expert
on human behavior,

10:42.195 --> 10:43.654
tell me how today's going to go.

10:43.656 --> 10:46.699
Easy. We're gonna drive
around for a few hours,

10:46.701 --> 10:48.327
taking only the tamest calls in town

10:48.329 --> 10:50.595
while your partner attempts
to smooth over your rough edges

10:50.597 --> 10:54.133
and convince me that, deep down,
you really are a sweetheart.

10:54.135 --> 10:55.300
Wrong.

10:55.302 --> 10:56.591
Today, I attached us

10:56.593 --> 10:58.529
to a high-risk warrant
service in Highland Park.

10:58.531 --> 11:00.572
Got you a bulletproof
vest in extra small.

11:00.574 --> 11:02.074
Only way to show you I'm a good cop

11:02.076 --> 11:04.409
is to show you I'm a good cop.

11:13.120 --> 11:15.954
Why does motor pool always
give us vehicles with no gas?

11:15.956 --> 11:17.189
Payback.

11:17.191 --> 11:18.290
Before you were my T.O.,

11:18.292 --> 11:19.992
I had an unintentional propensity

11:19.994 --> 11:22.028
for crashing police cars.

11:23.898 --> 11:25.297
Who needs the restroom?

11:25.299 --> 11:26.299
Come on.

11:29.970 --> 11:32.304
Alright, you guys. Who
wants some snacks? My treat.

11:32.306 --> 11:33.839
Yeah. Beer?

11:33.841 --> 11:34.908
That's a no. Hector?

11:35.943 --> 11:38.243
Another no. Here, guys.
Grab whatever you need.

11:38.245 --> 11:40.479
You two, over there. Now!

11:40.481 --> 11:42.749
You, over here.

11:45.486 --> 11:47.085
What are you doing?

11:47.087 --> 11:48.520
I'm buying them snacks.

11:48.522 --> 11:50.122
But you're about to tell
me I'm being too nice?

11:50.124 --> 11:51.790
They're not Boy Scouts.
They're criminals.

11:51.792 --> 11:53.492
I know you like to think I'm naive

11:53.494 --> 11:55.961
because I tend to see
the good in people,

11:55.963 --> 11:57.596
but that's just laziness on your part.

11:57.598 --> 11:59.531
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

11:59.533 --> 12:03.324
And I think you'd be surprised
to see the difference it makes

12:03.326 --> 12:05.204
when you show kids a
little bit of respect.

12:08.008 --> 12:10.210
You were saying?

12:16.740 --> 12:18.797
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa! Hector, let him go.

12:18.799 --> 12:20.277
Nah, I'm not adding time to my sentence

12:20.279 --> 12:22.146
because this fool decided
to boost his street cred

12:22.148 --> 12:23.214
by stealing a police ride.

12:23.216 --> 12:25.049
- No!
- Relax. You did good.

12:25.051 --> 12:26.617
Let him go.

12:29.122 --> 12:30.788
Easy. Fletcher! Hey, hey, hey!

12:30.790 --> 12:32.723
Knock it off. Come on, Fletcher.

12:32.725 --> 12:34.058
- What?
- Hands against the side of the car.

12:34.060 --> 12:35.226
Let's go.

12:35.228 --> 12:37.128
You dummy.

12:37.130 --> 12:38.496
Wasn't very smart.

12:38.498 --> 12:40.164
Now you're going back to juvie.

12:40.166 --> 12:41.188
It was worth it.

12:41.190 --> 12:43.200
- Everything Code 4?
- Yeah.

12:43.202 --> 12:44.969
Hector here stepped up
and did the right thing.

12:44.971 --> 12:46.671
- I didn't do it for you.
- Doesn't matter, Hector.

12:46.673 --> 12:48.038
The right thing is the right thing.

12:48.040 --> 12:49.173
- Is he for real?
- Yep.

12:49.175 --> 12:53.677
Control, 7-Adam-15 requesting
juvenile transportation.

12:59.318 --> 13:00.651
Think there's any chance

13:00.653 --> 13:02.776
Tim would come to New York?

13:02.778 --> 13:05.322
I don't know.

13:05.324 --> 13:08.058
I mean, he's L.A. pride born and bred,

13:08.060 --> 13:10.161
but he is crazy about you, so...

13:10.163 --> 13:11.518
You have no clue.

13:11.520 --> 13:12.609
The man's a mystery.

13:12.611 --> 13:14.067
What are they doing here?

13:14.069 --> 13:16.125
They're here to take
Paul back to the hospital.

13:16.127 --> 13:18.343
So the doctors can shrug
and say "Sorry, ma'am"

13:18.345 --> 13:20.278
to the tune of $10,000 a day?

13:20.280 --> 13:21.680
I'm afraid this is not a discussion.

13:21.682 --> 13:23.015
To hell it's not. I am his mother.

13:23.017 --> 13:25.817
Look, I believe you are
a danger to your child.

13:25.819 --> 13:28.353
Therefore, I'm removing
him from your care,

13:28.355 --> 13:29.521
pending a full investigation.

13:29.523 --> 13:30.622
No, you can't do that!

13:30.624 --> 13:31.757
- Ma'am, ma'am.
- You can't do that! No!

13:31.759 --> 13:32.924
- Ma'am, come over here, please.
- You can't do that.

13:32.926 --> 13:35.762
No, please. What are you doing?

13:38.656 --> 13:39.922
I just want to put it out there

13:39.924 --> 13:41.290
that you're completely disobeying

13:41.292 --> 13:42.691
a direct order from the Watch Commander.

13:42.693 --> 13:43.992
Grey just wants me to play nice,

13:43.994 --> 13:45.427
but how I act isn't going to matter

13:45.429 --> 13:46.995
to a geek who only looks at numbers.

13:46.997 --> 13:48.764
I need to convince him that there's data

13:48.766 --> 13:50.422
that he's not factoring
into his algorithm.

13:50.424 --> 13:51.513
And if he gets caught in the crossfire?

13:51.515 --> 13:52.701
Problem solved.

13:57.607 --> 13:59.730
Do exactly as I and the other
officers say at all times.

13:59.732 --> 14:00.820
- Got it?
- Got it.

14:00.822 --> 14:02.011
Morning. Who's this?

14:02.013 --> 14:03.035
Uh, Elvis.

14:03.037 --> 14:05.444
I run a risk evaluation
program for the LAPD.

14:05.446 --> 14:07.616
Huh. Well, you in the right place.

14:07.618 --> 14:09.685
Serving a warrant on the Jacobs Brothers

14:09.687 --> 14:11.812
is like playing chicken
with a runaway train.

14:11.814 --> 14:13.113
That's on fire.

14:13.115 --> 14:15.339
And filled with zombies.

14:15.341 --> 14:16.363
Steagald warrant?

14:16.365 --> 14:18.452
Even better... "no knock".

14:18.454 --> 14:20.621
That's why Detective
Armstrong's my favorite.

14:20.623 --> 14:21.855
- Nick Armstrong?
- Yeah. Why?

14:21.857 --> 14:23.457
My algorithm has you pinpointed

14:23.459 --> 14:25.559
as the highest-performing
detective in the station.

14:25.561 --> 14:26.660
An exemplary officer.

14:26.662 --> 14:29.063
"Exemplary".

14:29.065 --> 14:31.398
Let's catch some bad guys.

14:37.039 --> 14:38.172
Get on your knees! Hands up!

14:38.174 --> 14:39.206
LAPD! On the ground now!

14:39.208 --> 14:40.674
- On your knees!
- Now! Hands on your head!

14:40.676 --> 14:42.042
Hands behind your back now!

14:43.546 --> 14:45.546
This ain't right! You surprised us!

14:45.548 --> 14:47.715
- Code 4. Suspects in custody.
- Sit down.

14:52.188 --> 14:54.421
Want to hear some real
predictive analysis, Elvis?

14:54.423 --> 14:55.710
Ok... Yeah, okay.

14:55.712 --> 14:58.649
The suspect has begun to
show pre-assault indicators.

14:58.651 --> 15:00.226
Hey, nobody told you to stand up.

15:00.228 --> 15:01.729
Sit your ass back down. Now.

15:01.731 --> 15:04.157
Bladed stance. Rocking and bobbing.

15:04.159 --> 15:06.490
It means adrenaline
and oxygen are pumping.

15:06.492 --> 15:07.568
So you watch his eyes.

15:07.570 --> 15:10.671
Once they lock, it's go time.

15:10.673 --> 15:12.773
- Aah!
- Hyah!

15:12.775 --> 15:15.776
And that is why Officer
Lopez is my favorite.

15:15.778 --> 15:16.877
Get up, dummy.

15:16.879 --> 15:19.102
And that was a completely
justified use of force,

15:19.104 --> 15:20.126
by the way.

15:20.128 --> 15:21.188
The law says she doesn't have to wait

15:21.190 --> 15:22.850
for the suspect to
attack to defend herself.

15:22.852 --> 15:24.752
Okay. Uh, tell me more about that.

15:41.937 --> 15:43.203
It's natural to feel nervous.

15:43.205 --> 15:45.540
This ain't nothing.

15:47.243 --> 15:49.109
Welcome to Cal Correctional, Officers.

15:49.111 --> 15:51.545
Please hand over your duty
belts and backup pieces.

15:51.547 --> 15:53.947
They'll be secured in a locker here.

15:53.949 --> 15:55.649
Thought you were bringing
me four young men.

15:55.651 --> 15:57.785
Uh, one of them flamed
out before we got here.

15:57.787 --> 15:59.787
Sounds like I'll be meeting
him soon enough.

15:59.789 --> 16:01.789
You three, face the fence.

16:01.791 --> 16:03.957
You are now in my custody.

16:03.959 --> 16:05.959
You will obey every order I give,

16:05.961 --> 16:08.729
or I will put hands on you
and I will make you obey.

16:08.731 --> 16:10.831
You ball up your fist, I'll take
that as a sign of aggression

16:10.833 --> 16:12.933
and I will put you on the
ground and I will handcuff you.

16:12.935 --> 16:14.668
Is that clear?

16:14.670 --> 16:15.769
Is that clear?!

16:15.771 --> 16:17.604
Yes, sir.

16:17.606 --> 16:19.506
Let's move.

16:24.647 --> 16:27.421
Detective Harper, Officer Nolan.

16:27.423 --> 16:28.816
I'm Warden Miller.

16:28.818 --> 16:30.651
Have you been through
this program before?

16:30.653 --> 16:31.675
I haven't, no.

16:31.677 --> 16:32.820
Well, it can be intense.

16:32.822 --> 16:34.121
Do you have children of your own?

16:34.123 --> 16:35.756
I have a son who's 19.

16:35.758 --> 16:37.491
Then this is gonna be hard to watch.

16:49.138 --> 16:50.138
Take a seat.

16:55.144 --> 16:56.596
Are you deaf?

16:56.598 --> 16:58.353
- I gave you an order.
- Man, get off of me.

16:58.355 --> 17:00.948
I told you... you don't
listen, I make you listen.

17:00.950 --> 17:02.951
Now sit your ass down.

17:04.887 --> 17:06.686
Okay, bring 'em in.

17:12.194 --> 17:14.294
Hey! I know you.

17:14.296 --> 17:15.796
You've got to be kidding me.

17:15.798 --> 17:16.964
You know Oscar?

17:16.965 --> 17:19.800
I apprehended him twice during
multiple escape attempts.

17:19.801 --> 17:21.835
On one of those attempts,
he stabbed my friend.

17:21.837 --> 17:24.704
I can't imagine he has anything
useful to say to these kids.

17:24.707 --> 17:27.040
Yeah, well, he's not here
to say anything useful.

17:27.041 --> 17:29.009
He's here because he's the monster

17:29.011 --> 17:30.711
that they'll be locked up with.

17:30.713 --> 17:34.047
And Mr. Caine here
joined us 11 years ago,

17:34.049 --> 17:36.183
after he was convicted
of a double homicide.

17:36.185 --> 17:38.352
Oh, come on, Warden.
Give him some credit.

17:38.354 --> 17:40.654
Caine tore the arm off of a guy

17:40.656 --> 17:42.656
that he caught his wife
cheating on him with.

17:42.658 --> 17:44.558
He beat them both to death with it.

17:44.560 --> 17:46.727
Not sure it's a good idea
to remind him of that.

17:46.729 --> 17:49.196
No, but it sure is fun.

17:49.198 --> 17:50.832
Mm.

17:53.235 --> 17:55.202
Yeah.

17:55.204 --> 17:56.937
I know what you're thinking...

17:56.939 --> 17:58.839
you're better than me, right?

17:58.841 --> 18:03.210
Yeah, 'cause you on the outside,
'cause you got options.

18:03.212 --> 18:05.180
You just roll your eyes at me?

18:07.216 --> 18:09.049
What you got, a death wish?

18:09.051 --> 18:11.028
You think these guards gonna save you?

18:11.030 --> 18:12.252
I'm in here 40 years.

18:12.254 --> 18:14.588
You think I'm scared of
a few weeks in the hole,

18:14.590 --> 18:16.224
five more on my sentence?

18:17.359 --> 18:19.693
Step back, Caine.

18:19.695 --> 18:20.829
Now.

18:31.307 --> 18:34.875
Caine's passionate.

18:34.877 --> 18:37.277
He's got what
psychological professionals

18:37.279 --> 18:40.614
would describe as "anger issues".

18:40.616 --> 18:43.951
Say something wrong to him,
he'll turn your bones to dust.

18:43.953 --> 18:46.787
But deep down, the real reason
that he's here with you

18:46.789 --> 18:48.722
is because he wishes that someone

18:48.724 --> 18:51.848
had diverted him from this place.

18:51.850 --> 18:52.860
Not me.

18:52.862 --> 18:55.829
I'm here because
it got me out of my cell.

18:55.831 --> 18:59.733
Plus, it gives me a
glimpse of future prey.

18:59.735 --> 19:01.879
I want you guys to end up here.

19:01.881 --> 19:05.172
I'm gonna be behind bars until I'm 90...

19:05.174 --> 19:08.141
long as I don't get caught
blinding another inmate.

19:08.143 --> 19:10.110
Which I will never do again, ma'am.

19:10.112 --> 19:11.144
I have learned my lesson.

19:11.146 --> 19:13.680
Don't talk to me, Oscar. Talk to them.

19:13.682 --> 19:14.749
Yes, ma'am.

19:16.185 --> 19:18.318
So, you're the future
inmates of America.

19:18.320 --> 19:20.988
Trust me, stay on this path, do that,

19:20.990 --> 19:23.057
so you can end up in here with me.

19:25.794 --> 19:28.195
How many criminals get away
with their crimes, Officer Nolan?

19:28.197 --> 19:29.930
- Not many.
- Why is that?

19:29.932 --> 19:30.998
Because they're dumb.

19:31.000 --> 19:32.299
Oh, I'm not dumb.

19:32.301 --> 19:34.434
No, but you lack impulse control.

19:34.436 --> 19:36.336
Yes!

19:36.338 --> 19:38.039
I do!

19:44.346 --> 19:45.913
What's your name?

19:45.915 --> 19:46.947
Hector.

19:46.949 --> 19:49.116
Do you think that you're
a tough guy, Hector?

19:49.118 --> 19:51.952
- I know I am.
- You're not.

19:51.954 --> 19:54.688
Uh, maybe you are.
Doesn't really matter.

19:54.690 --> 19:57.024
There's always gonna be
somebody tougher than you,

19:57.026 --> 20:00.027
somebody willing to
do what you won't do.

20:00.029 --> 20:01.451
Do you know that tough guys

20:01.453 --> 20:04.031
get shanked to death in here every day?

20:04.033 --> 20:06.466
Not me, though.

20:06.468 --> 20:08.835
'Cause I'm not a tough guy.

20:08.837 --> 20:11.705
I'm a cockroach.

20:11.707 --> 20:14.309
I'll do whatever it takes
to come out on top.

20:17.379 --> 20:19.746
This is not how to reach Hector.

20:19.748 --> 20:22.182
It is not your job
to tell her how to do hers.

20:22.184 --> 20:24.217
It's okay, Detective.
I'm willing to listen.

20:24.219 --> 20:26.887
Hector's brother, Thomas,
is incarcerated here.

20:26.889 --> 20:30.757
So you think that a family
reunion is more effective?

20:30.759 --> 20:32.826
I read both their files.

20:32.828 --> 20:35.395
Hector was a model citizen
before his brother got arrested.

20:35.397 --> 20:37.030
He idolized him.

20:37.032 --> 20:39.354
But he hasn't visited in almost a year

20:39.356 --> 20:40.934
because Thomas refuses to see him.

20:40.936 --> 20:42.235
Maybe it's time for Hector

20:42.237 --> 20:44.071
to see how far his brother has fallen.

20:49.244 --> 20:50.844
Hey, you got a minute?

20:50.846 --> 20:52.012
Oh, yeah, of course.

20:52.014 --> 20:53.703
I just spoke to Paul's doctors.

20:53.705 --> 20:55.215
Tox labs came back clean.

20:55.217 --> 20:58.752
They ran every commonly
available poison... nothing.

20:58.754 --> 21:01.421
Wait, so how is his mom making him sick?

21:01.423 --> 21:04.858
I don't know, but this
whole thing is not adding up.

21:04.860 --> 21:06.360
Hmm.

21:06.362 --> 21:08.095
I'm gonna reach out to a co-worker

21:08.097 --> 21:09.763
who had a case on the same block.

21:09.765 --> 21:11.064
Maybe she heard something.

21:11.066 --> 21:13.200
- That's great. Keep me posted?
- Will do.

21:14.403 --> 21:16.970
Down. Up.

21:16.972 --> 21:19.206
Down. Up.

21:19.208 --> 21:21.074
Don't... Don't you dare stop.

21:21.076 --> 21:22.076
Give it a rest, Caine.

21:23.545 --> 21:25.078
Boy's with me.

21:25.080 --> 21:26.413
Get up.

21:26.415 --> 21:27.706
On your feet, on your feet!

21:27.708 --> 21:28.775
Let's go!

21:29.762 --> 21:30.784
Thomas?

21:30.786 --> 21:32.886
You on the phone every week,

21:32.888 --> 21:35.155
telling me how great you're doing,

21:35.157 --> 21:36.356
and this is how I see you?

21:38.427 --> 21:40.560
Hector's been getting into
a lot of trouble lately.

21:40.562 --> 21:43.897
Spent the last few months
in juvie for theft and drugs.

21:43.899 --> 21:46.433
He wants to follow in his
big brother's footsteps.

21:46.435 --> 21:48.135
Why the hell you want to do that?

21:48.137 --> 21:49.469
Because he doesn't know any better.

21:49.471 --> 21:51.238
He thinks you're a role model.

21:51.240 --> 21:52.305
Hey, don't talk to him like that.

21:52.307 --> 21:54.241
No, lady cop's right.

21:54.243 --> 21:55.475
I'm no one to be proud of.

21:55.477 --> 21:56.543
How can you say that?

21:56.545 --> 21:58.478
You run things in here.
People respect you.

21:58.480 --> 22:00.981
No, they're afraid of me.

22:00.983 --> 22:02.916
That ain't the same thing.

22:05.120 --> 22:07.454
When you're in here, you can't
afford to be a human being.

22:07.456 --> 22:11.358
And once you lose that,
you can never get it back.

22:13.429 --> 22:14.961
Don't be me.

22:17.176 --> 22:18.198
What's that?

22:18.200 --> 22:19.845
Just a little bit of trouble.

22:19.847 --> 22:21.835
It's a daily occurrence around here,

22:21.837 --> 22:23.303
but I do need to go see to it.

22:23.305 --> 22:26.407
Sharp, put the three of
them on a short leash.

22:28.343 --> 22:29.543
Warden's lying.

22:29.545 --> 22:33.346
Two short bursts mean
there's a riot going on.

22:33.348 --> 22:36.250
About to get crazy up in here.

22:39.262 --> 22:41.285
Sir, do you have a second?

22:41.287 --> 22:43.321
Sure. What's up?

22:43.323 --> 22:45.823
Hypothetically,

22:45.825 --> 22:47.592
what's involved in a lateral move?

22:47.594 --> 22:49.227
Well, I hate to lose you,

22:49.229 --> 22:51.229
but the truth is,
it'd be pretty seamless.

22:51.231 --> 22:52.463
What about NYPD?

22:52.465 --> 22:54.899
That's a whole other beast.

22:54.901 --> 22:57.560
You would have to go
to the NYPD Academy,

22:57.562 --> 22:58.918
complete the FTO program

22:58.920 --> 23:00.805
before you'd even be
allowed back on the streets.

23:00.807 --> 23:02.907
You would basically be
starting from square one.

23:04.344 --> 23:06.477
In fact

23:06.479 --> 23:08.913
you would be the John Nolan of the NYPD.

23:08.915 --> 23:10.782
No, you see that's not funny.

23:10.784 --> 23:14.685
That's hilarious.

23:14.687 --> 23:17.522
It'd be a big sacrifice.

23:17.524 --> 23:19.490
But if Rachel's the
one, it'd be worth it.

23:19.492 --> 23:21.393
Who said this was about Rachel?

23:24.164 --> 23:26.364
Just be sure.

23:26.366 --> 23:28.666
Moving in together is tough enough.

23:28.668 --> 23:32.107
Plus new jobs, new city, no
social network to lean on...

23:32.109 --> 23:33.938
You don't want to end
up resenting each other.

23:33.940 --> 23:35.973
Thanks.

23:35.975 --> 23:37.608
Anytime, "Boot".

23:38.945 --> 23:40.344
Why'd he call you "Boot"?

23:40.346 --> 23:41.914
Nothing. Inside joke.

23:43.195 --> 23:44.622
Hey. What's up?

23:44.624 --> 23:46.504
My co-worker heard that a few other kids

23:46.506 --> 23:48.206
in the neighborhood got sick recently.

23:48.208 --> 23:49.723
Turns out, the city started maintenance

23:49.725 --> 23:51.542
on the main water line four months ago,

23:51.544 --> 23:53.044
so they switched to well water.

23:53.046 --> 23:54.512
And Paul got sick three months ago.

23:54.514 --> 23:56.514
Five years ago, Seaver
Chemical was accused

23:56.516 --> 23:58.516
of dumping heavy metals
from their refinery.

23:58.518 --> 24:01.519
They paid a small fine and
got a high-priced consultant

24:01.521 --> 24:04.355
to certify that the environmental
impact was negligible.

24:04.357 --> 24:05.893
Well, clearly, that
might not be the case.

24:05.895 --> 24:08.559
Yes, but that does not help Iris.

24:08.561 --> 24:11.195
I got her son taken away from her,

24:11.197 --> 24:13.031
and reversing that is not gonna be easy.

24:13.033 --> 24:14.840
Can't you just tell the
judge you made a mistake?

24:14.842 --> 24:18.336
Not without definitive proof.

24:18.338 --> 24:22.073
Iris could lose her son

24:22.075 --> 24:25.510
all because I pulled
the trigger too quickly.

24:25.512 --> 24:26.711
It's okay.

24:29.516 --> 24:31.849
Better hope that the
Warden squashes this riot.

24:31.851 --> 24:35.553
Cops and kids are about the best
hostages inmates could dream of.

24:35.555 --> 24:36.621
Oscar, shut up.

24:36.623 --> 24:38.823
Shouldn't you take these
guys back to their cells?

24:38.825 --> 24:40.591
I mean, Harper and I can guard the kids.

24:40.593 --> 24:42.226
I don't make a move without orders.

24:45.498 --> 24:47.832
I'm guessing three bursts
is worse than two?

24:47.834 --> 24:49.267
It's just a call to prayer.

24:49.269 --> 24:52.570
As in... pray they kill you quick.

24:52.572 --> 24:55.840
Wait. So, uh, you called them
"pre-assault indicators", right?

24:55.842 --> 24:57.408
- Right.
- I got a question.

24:57.410 --> 24:59.177
Did you use your dating algorithm

24:59.179 --> 25:00.878
as a base for the LAPD one?

25:00.880 --> 25:02.780
'Course not.

25:02.782 --> 25:04.682
That's a yes.

25:04.684 --> 25:06.417
Hold on just a second. Sally.

25:06.419 --> 25:08.419
- Elvis, Elvis, where are you?
- Wh...

25:08.421 --> 25:10.329
- He's got a gun.
- Wait, wait, wait. C-Calm down, calm down.

25:10.331 --> 25:11.556
- What's going on?
- One of our clients, I think.

25:11.558 --> 25:13.057
- Uh, who?
- What's happening?

25:13.059 --> 25:14.625
- He's got a gun. He said it's our fault.
- Uh, uh, one of our clients

25:14.627 --> 25:16.627
blames us for his breakup, and
he just showed up with a gun.

25:16.629 --> 25:17.972
Oh, my God. Help!

25:17.974 --> 25:19.797
Uh, wait, Sally, are you still there?

25:19.799 --> 25:21.099
- Sally?
- 7-Adam-07.

25:27.273 --> 25:28.606
7-Adam-07.

25:28.608 --> 25:30.374
We're on scene and have
a possible active shooter

25:30.376 --> 25:32.610
at 2100 Knoll Road. Shots fired.

25:32.612 --> 25:34.098
Wait here behind our car.

25:34.100 --> 25:35.876
When officers arrive, show
them what door we went in

25:35.878 --> 25:37.180
and do exactly as they tell you.

25:37.182 --> 25:39.743
7-Adam-07. We're making entry
now through the north door.

25:39.745 --> 25:42.420
Repeat, two officers
making entry, north door.

25:42.422 --> 25:44.155
All responding units, Code 3.

25:44.157 --> 25:45.723
- Copy. 7-Adam-07 making entry on an active shooter.
- You're not waiting for backup?

25:45.725 --> 25:47.258
Not on an active shooter. We go in.

25:47.260 --> 25:49.227
But you don't. No matter
what you see or hear,

25:49.229 --> 25:50.762
you stay outside, stay behind cover!

25:50.764 --> 25:52.579
If you follow us in, the
coroner can carry you out.

25:52.581 --> 25:53.648
Understand?

26:03.810 --> 26:05.877
- Help us! He's got a gun!
- Go! Go!

26:05.879 --> 26:07.478
How many shooters? How many shooters?

26:07.480 --> 26:08.780
How many shooters? Go!

26:08.782 --> 26:10.782
- Go!
- Go, go!

26:10.784 --> 26:12.350
Go! Get out!

26:25.865 --> 26:26.931
- Go, go, go!
- Go, go, go!

26:26.933 --> 26:28.666
- Get out! Go, go!
- Go!

26:34.374 --> 26:36.307
Go! Go! Go!

26:36.309 --> 26:37.476
Go, go, go!

26:39.212 --> 26:40.930
7-Adam-07, units are landing.

26:40.932 --> 26:42.480
Can you give us an update?

26:45.685 --> 26:48.486
7-Adam-07, security check.

26:48.488 --> 26:51.522
7-Adam-100, be advised
7-Adam-07 not responding.

26:51.524 --> 26:53.391
We have more...

27:02.702 --> 27:04.303
Shh.

27:12.912 --> 27:14.313
Oh!

27:18.418 --> 27:19.650
Get on your stomach!

27:19.652 --> 27:21.819
Control, 7-Adam-07. Shooter in custody.

27:21.821 --> 27:23.254
Code 4 in the Bullpen.

27:23.256 --> 27:25.357
Copy, shooter in custody. Code 4.

27:27.498 --> 27:29.568
Hey. How bad is it out there?

27:29.570 --> 27:33.093
Several casualties.
Mostly inmates, one guard.

27:33.095 --> 27:35.919
60% of the prison is
under inmate control,

27:35.921 --> 27:37.120
which means you've got to go.

27:37.122 --> 27:39.256
Lock them in cells in B Wing

27:39.258 --> 27:41.124
and then fold in with the CERT team.

27:41.126 --> 27:43.960
C.O. Sharp is going to
escort you and the kids

27:43.962 --> 27:45.128
to the nearest exit.

27:45.130 --> 27:46.830
At this moment, the coast is clear.

27:46.832 --> 27:48.298
Be safe.

27:48.300 --> 27:50.968
Officers, take care of my brother.

27:52.204 --> 27:54.004
I won't let anything happen to him.

27:54.006 --> 27:56.273
You have my word.

27:56.275 --> 27:58.008
You listen to this man.

27:58.010 --> 27:59.666
Do what he says.

27:59.668 --> 28:01.678
And stay the hell away from here.

28:01.680 --> 28:04.681
You're better than me. Act like it.

28:09.154 --> 28:10.987
Okay, let's go.

28:16.929 --> 28:18.028
See you later, John.

28:18.030 --> 28:19.796
Alright. Time to move.

28:19.798 --> 28:21.798
Not yet. We need weapons.

28:21.800 --> 28:23.768
In case the way is not clear.

28:26.705 --> 28:28.171
Come on, boys.

28:28.173 --> 28:29.739
You never wanted to smash
up a classroom before?

28:29.741 --> 28:30.908
Now's your chance.

28:32.044 --> 28:34.210
Hey. Are you scared?

28:34.212 --> 28:36.046
You want the truth?

28:36.048 --> 28:37.470
No.

28:37.472 --> 28:39.182
I'm not scared at all.

28:39.184 --> 28:41.651
- Right.
- Let's go.

28:41.653 --> 28:43.776
Is there a way out of here that
doesn't go through a cell block?

28:43.778 --> 28:44.854
No.

28:44.856 --> 28:45.989
I knew he was gonna say that.

28:45.991 --> 28:47.724
Let's go, boys. Thank you.

28:47.726 --> 28:49.693
Come on.

28:55.233 --> 28:58.835
Alright, well, we're gonna
get a paramedic to look at you.

28:58.837 --> 29:01.204
Six victims. So far, no fatalities.

29:01.206 --> 29:03.073
Oh, th... thank God.

29:03.075 --> 29:05.241
I never saw this coming.

29:05.243 --> 29:07.043
Why did I not see this coming?

29:07.045 --> 29:09.913
Because you trusted the
data, but people lie.

29:09.915 --> 29:12.171
No guy is gonna reveal a
history of domestic violence

29:12.173 --> 29:13.261
in his dating profile.

29:13.263 --> 29:16.219
But I thought that I-I
had factored in firewalls

29:16.221 --> 29:17.687
for erroneous data.

29:17.689 --> 29:19.089
Not enough.

29:55.327 --> 29:57.260
He's dead.

29:57.262 --> 29:58.795
Just keep walking.

29:58.797 --> 30:00.397
Keep moving, boys. Come on.

30:00.399 --> 30:02.232
Let's go.

30:02.234 --> 30:03.733
Keep walking. Come on, boys.

30:05.103 --> 30:06.670
Hector. Hey, Hector.

30:06.672 --> 30:07.771
No!

30:07.773 --> 30:08.805
Just...

30:14.246 --> 30:17.013
Hey, J.J., I got those
Scared Straight kids.

30:17.015 --> 30:19.050
Hell yeah. On our way.

30:20.619 --> 30:22.008
You don't have to do this, you guys.

30:22.010 --> 30:23.153
Yeah, we do.

30:23.155 --> 30:24.988
Then we're done talking.

30:24.990 --> 30:26.423
Boys, get behind us.

30:54.019 --> 30:55.885
Nolan! We got to go!

30:55.887 --> 30:57.454
- Move! Move!
- Go! Go!

31:08.900 --> 31:11.801
Get up, get up, get up!

31:13.238 --> 31:14.972
- It's locked.
- Keys.

31:17.042 --> 31:18.208
Come on, come on, come on.

31:33.825 --> 31:35.648
Hey. Have you heard from Rachel?

31:35.650 --> 31:36.726
No. Why?

31:36.728 --> 31:39.032
She blames herself
for yanking Iris's son

31:39.034 --> 31:40.230
before the tests were run.

31:40.232 --> 31:41.898
Look, I've been calling, texting.

31:41.900 --> 31:42.966
She's not getting back to me.

31:42.968 --> 31:44.734
What do you think, she's
gonna do something stupid?

31:44.736 --> 31:47.271
You know her better than
I do. What do you think?

31:56.248 --> 31:59.349
Listen up. We got ourselves a VIP.

31:59.351 --> 32:01.184
Get your hands off me!

32:01.186 --> 32:02.952
- That's the Warden.
- You try and take the prison back,

32:02.954 --> 32:04.020
we'll rip her to pieces.

32:04.022 --> 32:06.189
A list of demands will be forthwith.

32:06.191 --> 32:07.857
Until then, have a great day.

32:07.859 --> 32:09.425
Any chance that CERT team is nearby?

32:09.427 --> 32:11.461
No, they're clear on the
other side of the prison.

32:11.463 --> 32:13.229
There's no way they'll
get to her in time.

32:15.267 --> 32:16.933
But we can.

32:16.935 --> 32:18.868
Why? You don't owe her nothing.

32:18.870 --> 32:20.670
'Cause it's the right thing to do.
You remember that.

32:20.672 --> 32:22.322
You practiced it back
at the gas station.

32:22.324 --> 32:24.407
Why does everything have to be
a teachable moment with you?

32:24.409 --> 32:25.976
Because he knows it's annoying.

32:27.112 --> 32:29.479
8977.

32:29.481 --> 32:30.980
You ready?

32:30.982 --> 32:32.082
Yeah.

32:38.418 --> 32:40.720
Why're we going this way?

32:40.722 --> 32:42.011
The Warden's in the opposite direction.

32:42.013 --> 32:43.189
I know, but we need a little help.

32:43.191 --> 32:44.258
From who?

32:47.162 --> 32:48.361
Hey, guys.

32:48.363 --> 32:50.363
Why aren't you out there running
wild, like the rest of them?

32:50.365 --> 32:53.033
I was, then I got tired.

32:53.035 --> 32:55.368
All I really wanted to do

32:55.370 --> 32:58.255
was beat the hell out of
this one guy, Kevin Medved.

32:58.257 --> 32:59.279
And did you?

32:59.281 --> 33:01.341
No, somebody beat me to it.

33:01.343 --> 33:03.143
I know, right? Just my luck.

33:03.145 --> 33:08.214
But I did get to laugh in
his face, which was nice.

33:08.216 --> 33:12.052
I'm surprised to see
you two in one piece.

33:12.054 --> 33:13.420
Where's the kids?

33:13.422 --> 33:15.388
Did you trade them for safe passage?

33:15.390 --> 33:16.479
No, we got them out.

33:16.481 --> 33:19.225
And then you came back.

33:19.227 --> 33:20.694
For the Warden.

33:20.696 --> 33:22.529
Mm. Why you coming to me?

33:22.531 --> 33:23.830
'Cause you're gonna help us get her out.

33:23.832 --> 33:25.398
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

33:25.400 --> 33:27.767
If I've learned anything about
you these last few months,

33:27.769 --> 33:29.703
it's that you are the
ultimate opportunist.

33:29.705 --> 33:31.061
You find yourself in a situation

33:31.063 --> 33:33.206
where there's a chance to
escape, you try to escape.

33:33.208 --> 33:34.541
But there's no escaping today,

33:34.543 --> 33:36.409
which is why you're
still here in your cell.

33:36.411 --> 33:39.245
So I'm here to offer
you the next best thing.

33:39.247 --> 33:41.748
To escape? There is no such thing.

33:41.750 --> 33:43.850
Sure there is. Privileges.

33:43.852 --> 33:46.586
You help us rescue the Warden,
you can ask for anything.

33:46.588 --> 33:48.088
You help us, we help you.

33:48.090 --> 33:49.557
Are you in, or are you out?

33:54.363 --> 33:55.595
Have a seat on the bench.

33:55.597 --> 33:56.696
Whoa. What's going on?

33:56.698 --> 33:58.765
She assaulted some corporate
guy outside his office.

33:58.767 --> 34:01.357
I did not. I threw water in his face.

34:01.359 --> 34:02.381
Contaminated water?

34:02.383 --> 34:03.470
No.

34:03.472 --> 34:05.438
But he thought it was.

34:05.440 --> 34:07.341
Can I talk to you for a second?

34:09.110 --> 34:11.710
Let me take her off
your hands, cite her out.

34:11.713 --> 34:13.402
She's all yours.

34:13.405 --> 34:14.405
Thanks.

34:16.318 --> 34:18.318
What the hell were you thinking?

34:18.320 --> 34:21.321
He didn't even
care... that kids are sick.

34:21.322 --> 34:23.322
And he's got kids of his own.

34:23.324 --> 34:25.291
And you were surprised by that?

34:26.661 --> 34:28.628
What do I do now?

34:28.630 --> 34:30.630
How do I make everything right?

34:30.632 --> 34:32.266
I don't know that you can.

34:34.235 --> 34:37.237
But I've... I've called in some favors,

34:37.239 --> 34:40.473
and I got the Deputy
Chief to call the judge.

34:40.475 --> 34:42.342
And based on my personal assurances,

34:42.344 --> 34:46.080
he's reversing the order
removing Paul from his home.

34:49.317 --> 34:52.119
You... You did that for me?

34:54.255 --> 34:56.755
Even though I'm leaving?

34:57.859 --> 34:59.393
Duh.

35:00.662 --> 35:01.795
Tim, I...

35:01.797 --> 35:04.931
I know, I know.

35:04.933 --> 35:06.633
Look, do... do you want to cry about it,

35:06.635 --> 35:10.870
or do you want to go get Iris
and... and bring her to her son?

35:10.872 --> 35:12.839
Both.

35:12.841 --> 35:14.542
Yeah, I can work with that.

35:32.861 --> 35:35.361
Hey. Don't screw us.

35:35.363 --> 35:36.729
Relax.

35:44.406 --> 35:46.372
Hey, guys.

35:46.374 --> 35:48.541
Oscar, get your crazy ass out of here

35:48.543 --> 35:49.709
before I slice you open.

35:49.711 --> 35:52.679
Okay. I guess I'll, uh, trade
these two cops I caught

35:52.681 --> 35:53.948
to the Mexicans.

35:55.350 --> 35:57.417
You got those cops?

35:57.419 --> 35:58.985
Where?

35:58.987 --> 36:00.887
Just outside here. I tied 'em up.

36:24.246 --> 36:26.346
- Ready?
- Yeah.

36:28.416 --> 36:30.950
Hi. We'll get you out of here now.

36:30.952 --> 36:32.886
Thank goodness.

36:32.888 --> 36:34.510
What the hell is he doing here with you?

36:34.512 --> 36:35.755
Saving you.

36:35.757 --> 36:37.590
And my services don't come cheap.

36:37.592 --> 36:40.760
We're gonna start the bidding
with a plasma television screen,

36:40.762 --> 36:43.029
followed by biweekly conjugal visits.

36:43.031 --> 36:44.898
We told him you'd make a deal.

36:44.900 --> 36:45.965
I will not.

36:45.967 --> 36:47.334
Then I'll see you later.

36:48.937 --> 36:50.004
Fine.

36:51.873 --> 36:53.407
- Fine.
- Let's go.

37:03.722 --> 37:05.388
Get behind me.

37:12.323 --> 37:15.080
Thank the good Lord.
I just found these two

37:15.082 --> 37:18.139
trying to steal the
Warden from you guys.

37:18.141 --> 37:19.631
Where's Hector?

37:19.633 --> 37:21.689
We got him out.

37:21.691 --> 37:22.813
For real?

37:22.815 --> 37:23.937
For real.

37:23.939 --> 37:25.195
Back off, Thomas.

37:25.197 --> 37:27.812
This ain't got nothing to do with you.

37:27.814 --> 37:29.147
They walk.

37:29.149 --> 37:30.782
Like hell they do.

37:30.784 --> 37:32.083
They walk.

37:51.695 --> 37:52.828
Thank you.

37:57.368 --> 38:01.604
So I'm gonna make sure these
guys find their way out.

38:06.944 --> 38:09.805
Sit here. I'll change, and
then I'll take you to juvie

38:09.807 --> 38:11.813
to process out with
the rest of the boys.

38:11.815 --> 38:13.549
Cool. Thanks.

38:15.786 --> 38:17.486
Paperwork can wait till tomorrow.

38:17.488 --> 38:18.720
I hear that.

38:18.722 --> 38:20.522
- See you in a minute.
- See you.

38:20.524 --> 38:22.724
Hey, trouble kind of
finds you, doesn't it?

38:22.726 --> 38:25.293
They told us to scare the kids.

38:25.295 --> 38:26.695
We scared those kids.

38:26.697 --> 38:28.230
How are things going with Grace?

38:28.232 --> 38:29.664
Ah, I'm not sure.

38:29.666 --> 38:31.900
She's having dinner
with her ex as we speak.

38:31.902 --> 38:33.301
That a problem?

38:33.303 --> 38:34.836
I don't know. I guess that's up to her.

38:34.838 --> 38:35.937
She knows how I feel.

38:35.939 --> 38:37.506
And how do you feel?

38:39.676 --> 38:41.843
I'm a little in love with her.

38:41.845 --> 38:42.878
You tell her that?

38:42.880 --> 38:44.513
Well, I...

38:44.515 --> 38:47.849
implied it, you know, with my actions.

38:47.851 --> 38:49.518
- It's not the same, is it?
- Nope.

38:49.520 --> 38:50.741
Okay, so, you guys want
to hear something funny?

38:50.743 --> 38:52.654
- It's not that funny.
- No, it definitely is.

38:52.656 --> 38:54.256
- Just not to you.
- I'm losing interest.

38:54.258 --> 38:56.391
Okay, so, Elvis's algorithm
flagged Lopez

38:56.393 --> 38:58.727
- as being most likely to get sued, right?
- Okay?

38:58.729 --> 39:00.829
- He got the wrong Lopez.
- What?

39:00.831 --> 39:02.564
He mixed up two lines
on his spreadsheet,

39:02.566 --> 39:03.999
confused me with another A. Lopez.

39:04.001 --> 39:05.567
Albert Lopez from Property Crimes?

39:05.569 --> 39:06.902
No, Angelo Lopez in Vice.

39:06.904 --> 39:08.403
Oh, in Vice.

39:08.405 --> 39:10.005
Funny, right?

39:18.916 --> 39:21.416
Hey. Harper will be
out in just a minute.

39:21.418 --> 39:23.351
Can I get you some food
for the road or something?

39:23.353 --> 39:24.553
No, I'm... I'm good.

39:24.555 --> 39:28.056
Tell me, have I earned the right
to give you a little advice?

39:28.058 --> 39:30.025
Another teachable moment? Really?

39:30.027 --> 39:31.927
Only if you'd care to hear it.

39:31.929 --> 39:34.563
Fair enough. Hit me.

39:34.565 --> 39:35.832
Alright.

39:38.068 --> 39:40.769
It's okay to put yourself
second once in a while.

39:40.771 --> 39:42.906
Those men today at the prison,

39:42.908 --> 39:45.307
they all had one thing in common...

39:45.309 --> 39:46.508
they were selfish.

39:46.510 --> 39:50.745
They put their own petty,
reckless needs above all else.

39:50.747 --> 39:54.616
When my dad abandoned us, I acted out.

39:54.618 --> 39:57.052
I got into fights. I...

39:57.054 --> 39:59.554
I made bad choices.

39:59.556 --> 40:02.624
And I drove my mom crazy with worry,

40:02.626 --> 40:05.494
and I didn't like how that felt.

40:05.496 --> 40:09.064
She needed me to be better.

40:09.066 --> 40:10.765
So that's what I did.

40:10.767 --> 40:12.400
You make it sound so easy.

40:12.402 --> 40:16.805
It's really not easy,
but it was worth it.

40:18.308 --> 40:19.341
You ready?

40:19.343 --> 40:20.742
Uh, yeah.

40:25.649 --> 40:26.815
Thanks.

40:26.817 --> 40:27.884
Anytime.

40:34.324 --> 40:36.024
- Hi.
- Hey.

40:36.026 --> 40:38.493
I hope that it's okay
that I just came by.

40:38.495 --> 40:40.028
Yeah, of course, of course.

40:40.030 --> 40:42.664
You're... You finished
your dinner with, uh...

40:42.666 --> 40:43.999
- Simon.
- Simon.

40:44.001 --> 40:46.001
Yeah.

40:46.003 --> 40:49.337
- Been an interesting day.
- It certainly has.

40:49.339 --> 40:51.673
Yeah.

40:51.675 --> 40:54.042
- I need to tell you something.
- I need to tell you something.

40:54.044 --> 40:55.810
I need to go first.

40:55.812 --> 40:57.345
Okay.

40:59.783 --> 41:03.518
The reason that Oliver has
been having trouble at school

41:03.520 --> 41:05.720
is because of the divorce.

41:05.722 --> 41:07.455
The separation.

41:07.457 --> 41:08.823
Right.

41:08.825 --> 41:10.593
Simon...

41:14.531 --> 41:16.599
He wants to give it another try.

41:18.702 --> 41:21.036
For Oliver.

41:25.842 --> 41:27.409
What do you want?

41:27.411 --> 41:29.511
I don't know.

41:29.513 --> 41:33.582
You and I have such a great thing.

41:37.588 --> 41:40.183
But if getting back together with Simon

41:40.185 --> 41:43.725
is the best thing for Oliver,

41:43.727 --> 41:45.995
how can I dismiss that?

41:48.932 --> 41:51.100
I just need to take some time.

41:54.605 --> 41:56.571
I'm so sorry.
