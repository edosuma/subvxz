WEBVTT

00:05.600 --> 00:07.433
Jesus, Dave.

00:07.500 --> 00:08.767
[retch]

00:11.367 --> 00:13.267
Men shouldn't lie to women.

00:13.333 --> 00:14.900
Don't feel
you need to talk to me.

00:14.967 --> 00:17.500
Nothing ventured,
nothing gained.

00:17.567 --> 00:20.600
Rob: Hey, Harita, I want
to talk about my future,

00:20.667 --> 00:22.967
see if you had any use
for this old bag of bones

00:23.033 --> 00:24.500
around the old shop.

00:24.567 --> 00:25.567
I miss you guys.

00:34.533 --> 00:36.333
Okay.

00:36.400 --> 00:38.333
[Rob, Sharon grunting]

00:38.400 --> 00:40.033
Where do you want me to come?

00:40.100 --> 00:41.633
- Okay.
- No, where?

00:41.700 --> 00:43.533
- Huh?
- Aah!

00:45.567 --> 00:47.333
Ugh.

00:47.400 --> 00:48.333
Ahh.

00:48.400 --> 00:49.667
Ohh.

00:49.733 --> 00:52.633
Are you sure it's okay
that we did that?

00:52.700 --> 00:54.400
Yeah, it's fine because--

00:56.567 --> 00:57.700
Oh, shit.

00:57.767 --> 00:59.800
Oh, fuck it.
It should be okay.

00:59.867 --> 01:01.100
Did you pre-cum in me?

01:01.167 --> 01:03.300
Yeah, I was pre-cumming
before I put it in.

01:03.367 --> 01:05.400
Well, that's not very nice.

01:07.933 --> 01:10.333
We need to be using
birth control.

01:10.400 --> 01:11.633
We can't have any more kids.

01:11.700 --> 01:14.233
I gotta go and see
the doctor tomorrow anyway

01:14.300 --> 01:16.833
to work out why my tits
are so sore.

01:16.900 --> 01:20.167
I'll look into a coil
or something.

01:20.233 --> 01:22.067
You've been saying that
for over a year.

01:22.133 --> 01:24.900
Yeah, well, it's just hard
because if I get the coil,

01:24.967 --> 01:26.100
it will probably
stop the sore tits

01:26.167 --> 01:27.700
because it will be
stopping my periods,

01:27.767 --> 01:29.200
but the only thing
I like about my periods

01:29.267 --> 01:30.800
- is that I get big tits.
- That hurt.

01:30.867 --> 01:32.033
Yeah, but that are big.

01:32.100 --> 01:33.533
Yeah, I guess big tits

01:33.600 --> 01:35.100
are worth a little pain.

01:35.167 --> 01:36.567
I wonder how much pain
I'd put up with

01:36.633 --> 01:37.500
to be less fat.

01:37.567 --> 01:39.467
- Probably not much.
- Yeah.

01:42.800 --> 01:44.467
Thank you so much.

01:44.533 --> 01:46.100
[laughing]

01:48.133 --> 01:49.967
What time do your folks
get in tomorrow?

01:50.033 --> 01:52.033
Uh, they get in at 6.

01:52.100 --> 01:53.700
Fergal gets in at 3.

01:53.767 --> 01:55.067
What's he doing back here?

01:55.133 --> 01:56.900
He's got a little
business here.

01:56.967 --> 01:59.900
How the fuck has Fergal
managed to start
another business?

01:59.967 --> 02:01.833
Any idiot
can start a business.

02:01.900 --> 02:03.267
You could start a business.

02:03.333 --> 02:04.733
Business that sells what?

02:04.800 --> 02:05.867
Business.

02:05.933 --> 02:07.067
Do you not have any ideas?

02:07.133 --> 02:10.733
Well, I do have
an idea for an app.

02:10.800 --> 02:11.967
Get out.

02:12.033 --> 02:14.200
No, seriously. Listen.

02:14.267 --> 02:16.033
You know how
a lot of women in porn

02:16.100 --> 02:17.433
don't have pubic hair?

02:17.500 --> 02:18.400
Mm-hmm.

02:18.467 --> 02:19.900
And then you know
how the Terminator

02:19.967 --> 02:23.867
sees things with, like,
grids and heat signatures?

02:23.933 --> 02:25.033
What if there was an app

02:25.100 --> 02:26.800
that did the same
kind of thing

02:26.867 --> 02:28.167
but only for bald pussies,

02:28.233 --> 02:30.033
and when it found
a bald pussy,

02:30.100 --> 02:32.200
it put a nice healthy
bush on it?

02:32.267 --> 02:34.567
You pick the style.
Could be '70s bush

02:34.633 --> 02:37.033
or 1870s
if you really want to.

02:37.100 --> 02:38.900
But, I mean, that's,
you know, detail.

02:38.967 --> 02:40.733
That's up to the user.

02:40.800 --> 02:43.333
I'm being deadly serious now.

02:43.400 --> 02:45.100
That is a fucking
brilliant idea.

02:45.167 --> 02:46.733
Devil's advocate, though.

02:46.800 --> 02:48.133
Have you
thought about the fact

02:48.200 --> 02:49.633
that one day your daughter
might find out

02:49.700 --> 02:51.667
what you do for a living?
Doesn't that worry you?

02:51.733 --> 02:54.300
Am I worried that my
daughter will find out

02:54.367 --> 02:56.667
that I'm a feminist
innovator?

02:56.733 --> 02:58.100
No.

03:02.300 --> 03:04.067
[phone rings]

03:06.733 --> 03:08.033
Who's that?

03:08.100 --> 03:10.600
- Uh, Fran.
- You're not going
to answer it?

03:10.667 --> 03:12.500
No, I'll just let it
go to voicemail,
and then I'll text her.

03:12.567 --> 03:14.133
Hey, should I cook
for your folks?

03:14.200 --> 03:15.567
Are they going
to be eating?

03:15.633 --> 03:18.567
Uh, no. Let's not
set that precedent.

03:18.633 --> 03:21.467
You want to telegraph they're
not totally welcome here?

03:23.933 --> 03:26.267
Fran wants us to have
dinner tomorrow night

03:26.333 --> 03:28.467
with her and Chris.
That's weird.

03:28.533 --> 03:29.900
She wants to ask us
something.

03:29.967 --> 03:31.500
I wonder
what that's about.

03:31.567 --> 03:33.833
If you'd answered your phone,
you might know that.

03:33.900 --> 03:35.867
Maybe they want a threesome.

03:35.933 --> 03:38.567
Uh, so wait,
so three of us fuck,

03:38.633 --> 03:39.933
and then one of us
makes sandwiches?

03:40.000 --> 03:41.167
You know
I meant a foursome.

03:41.233 --> 03:42.567
I think that ship has sailed.

03:42.633 --> 03:43.733
What about your parents?

03:43.800 --> 03:45.333
No, I don't think they
want a foursome, either.

03:45.400 --> 03:47.933
Ha! No they're just here
for the night,

03:48.000 --> 03:49.200
and then they start
their funeral tour.

03:49.267 --> 03:51.633
Two funerals in one visit.
Fair play.

03:52.767 --> 03:53.933
Bye.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.067
Bye.

03:55.133 --> 03:56.433
Okay, I'm going
to go to school.

03:56.500 --> 03:58.133
Drop some science on
the leaders of tomorrow.

03:58.200 --> 03:59.233
What you doing?

03:59.300 --> 04:00.533
I'm just going
to make the most

04:00.600 --> 04:02.200
of my last few days
of freedom.

04:02.267 --> 04:04.933
Might go to a UKIP meeting
or get a tattoo.

04:05.000 --> 04:07.700
Ugh. Don't get a tattoo.

04:10.667 --> 04:14.400
You want to go on the,
um, sitting thing?

04:14.467 --> 04:17.067
The big soft sitting
thing with the squares.

04:17.133 --> 04:18.067
- Uh--
- The couch?

04:18.133 --> 04:19.533
Couch.

04:19.600 --> 04:20.633
Couch?

04:20.700 --> 04:22.033
It's called a couch.

04:22.100 --> 04:23.400
Ha. That's a silly word.

04:23.467 --> 04:24.667
Ha ha.

04:24.733 --> 04:27.633
So you're back
in the Braeband fold.

04:27.700 --> 04:30.000
- That sucks.
- Yeah, but look, you know,

04:30.067 --> 04:31.367
I was watching the news
the other night,

04:31.433 --> 04:33.833
and there's this doctor
in Aleppo,

04:33.900 --> 04:36.067
and he puts
people back together

04:36.133 --> 04:37.433
after they get blown up.

04:37.500 --> 04:39.033
And he just stays there
and sticks it out.

04:39.100 --> 04:40.867
And I know
that's not my situation,

04:40.933 --> 04:43.433
but my family is my Syria,

04:43.500 --> 04:45.600
and I have to work
at a terrible job

04:45.667 --> 04:47.800
so that they can eat
and live in a house,

04:47.867 --> 04:50.200
and that's just how it is.

04:50.267 --> 04:53.367
Isn't it more that you just
couldn't get another job?

04:55.633 --> 04:57.433
Oh, speaking of Syria.

05:00.333 --> 05:01.933
Catherine wants a baby.

05:02.000 --> 05:03.167
Really?

05:03.233 --> 05:04.567
Well, that's great, buddy.

05:04.633 --> 05:05.933
Yeah,
great for you, maybe.

05:06.000 --> 05:07.133
How's that great for me?

05:07.200 --> 05:08.233
I can't do it.

05:08.300 --> 05:09.667
Look at me. I'm an idiot.

05:09.733 --> 05:13.233
I haven't contributed
one thing to society.

05:13.300 --> 05:15.000
What could I contribute
as a father?

05:15.067 --> 05:18.867
What? You're funny.
You're enterprising.

05:18.933 --> 05:20.867
You have beautiful blue eyes.

05:20.933 --> 05:22.667
Rob,

05:22.733 --> 05:24.600
if you're asking
if you can jerk me off,

05:24.667 --> 05:26.233
the answer is yes.

05:28.400 --> 05:29.833
It's not unbearable pain.

05:29.900 --> 05:33.067
It's-- They just feel
sort of hot.

05:33.133 --> 05:35.633
You know,
and lumpier than usual,

05:35.700 --> 05:39.300
and yeah, you know,
if I touch them or run,

05:39.367 --> 05:41.233
they just feel tender.

05:43.600 --> 05:44.533
Nipples?

05:44.600 --> 05:45.433
Pardon?

05:45.500 --> 05:47.600
Do your nipples
feel tender?

05:47.667 --> 05:49.400
Mm-hmm. Mmm.

05:54.467 --> 05:55.533
Hmm.

06:00.300 --> 06:02.233
[keyboarding]

06:06.900 --> 06:08.233
You can put your top
back on now.

06:09.367 --> 06:11.100
Oh, okay.

06:11.167 --> 06:13.367
So I don't feel
anything suspicious.

06:13.433 --> 06:16.467
There are some fatty tissue
deposits here and there.

06:16.533 --> 06:19.900
And one of your nipples
is a little cock-eyed,

06:19.967 --> 06:22.767
but, uh, that's just cosmetic.

06:22.833 --> 06:24.967
Oh. Okay.

06:25.033 --> 06:26.367
Sorry.

06:27.933 --> 06:29.600
Geez, are my tits
that filthy?

06:30.667 --> 06:33.367
Now, if you want,
we can pop in a coil.

06:33.433 --> 06:34.600
That will stop your periods

06:34.667 --> 06:36.167
and almost certainly
stop the breast pain.

06:36.233 --> 06:38.733
Uh, what form of contraception
are you using now?

06:38.800 --> 06:39.833
Uh, pull it out.

06:39.900 --> 06:41.267
Um, the, you know,

06:41.333 --> 06:43.467
the pull-it-out--
usually-- method,

06:43.533 --> 06:45.067
which is obviously,
you know, silly.

06:45.133 --> 06:46.633
Reckless.

06:46.700 --> 06:48.067
Yeah. Right.

06:48.133 --> 06:49.800
I thought about
getting the coil,

06:49.867 --> 06:51.433
but, you know, I'm 44 now,

06:51.500 --> 06:53.100
and my husband's not
in great shape,

06:53.167 --> 06:55.067
so I just thought, What
are the chances, really?

06:55.133 --> 06:57.633
Would you like me to assess
your ovarian reserve?

06:57.700 --> 06:58.767
Eggs?

06:58.833 --> 06:59.800
Yeah.

06:59.867 --> 07:02.733
Uh, yeah, sure.

07:02.800 --> 07:04.000
How many do I have?

07:04.067 --> 07:05.633
Well, I'll have
to take a look-see.

07:05.700 --> 07:07.100
Okay, sure.

07:08.067 --> 07:09.700
Do I need to take
my tights off?

07:09.767 --> 07:12.333
I'd recommend it.

07:14.733 --> 07:16.500
- Hey.
- Hey!

07:16.567 --> 07:18.100
You ready?

07:18.167 --> 07:19.467
I thought we could go
get algae wraps

07:19.533 --> 07:21.067
before the Action
for Children dinner.

07:21.133 --> 07:22.600
Sure. Oh, shit.

07:22.667 --> 07:25.100
I left my, um-- um...

07:25.167 --> 07:27.367
Let me go grab my, uh--

07:27.433 --> 07:29.133
um...

07:29.200 --> 07:30.633
How have you been, Rob?

07:30.700 --> 07:32.267
Good. Great.

07:32.333 --> 07:33.500
How are you? How's--

07:33.567 --> 07:34.967
You were a real mess
the night Dave OD'd.

07:35.033 --> 07:37.000
It's none of my
business, really,

07:37.067 --> 07:38.400
but are you getting
the help that you need?

07:38.467 --> 07:41.933
Sure. I mean no
because I'm fine.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.933
You know,
it was a one-time thing.

07:44.000 --> 07:45.800
You know, if you
ever need to talk,

07:45.867 --> 07:47.533
you can just come over.

07:47.600 --> 07:49.200
Bring Sharon.

07:50.400 --> 07:51.667
See you later, buddy.

07:52.900 --> 07:55.067
Couch. I'm going
to look that up

07:55.133 --> 07:57.200
because I think
you're pulling my leg.

08:03.900 --> 08:05.767
Fergal:
That's our neighbors
Sebastian and Maria.

08:05.833 --> 08:07.433
They don't speak English,
but they have a Jacuzzi.

08:07.500 --> 08:09.867
- Ooh!
- There's Mallandra
in the Jacuzzi.

08:09.933 --> 08:11.967
- Ah.
- That's the kitchen.

08:12.033 --> 08:13.133
Oh!

08:13.200 --> 08:14.300
That's not our cat.

08:14.367 --> 08:16.067
That's just some Spanish cat.

08:16.133 --> 08:18.767
Oh, that's our fire grill,
or parrilla,

08:18.833 --> 08:20.533
where we do our asados.

08:20.600 --> 08:22.033
That's Spanish
for special barbecue.

08:22.100 --> 08:24.100
Wow, really living
the life of Riley.

08:24.167 --> 08:25.367
How's business?

08:25.433 --> 08:26.833
Well, my Spanish Uber idea

08:26.900 --> 08:28.567
hasn't got off the ground
yet for two reasons.

08:28.633 --> 08:30.400
The Spanish drivers
are unbelievably lazy.

08:30.467 --> 08:31.800
And then, when they actually
do show up on time,

08:31.867 --> 08:33.100
people get angry with them.

08:33.167 --> 08:34.533
If you're on time
for something in Spain,

08:34.600 --> 08:36.300
they look at you like
you've got two heads.

08:36.367 --> 08:38.033
Point is it's a lazy culture
with no respect for time.

08:38.100 --> 08:39.567
And you'd be better off
going into some kind

08:39.633 --> 08:41.167
of ham-based business.

08:41.233 --> 08:43.167
They always
have time for ham.

08:43.233 --> 08:45.067
But I'm going to be marketing
leather man bags over here

08:45.133 --> 08:46.567
that you get in Malaga
for fuck all.

08:46.633 --> 08:48.267
They're cheap as chips,
and they're great quality.

08:48.333 --> 08:49.933
Dad already bought one.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.700
Dad, show us your man bag.

08:51.767 --> 08:52.967
- What?
- Your new bag.

08:53.033 --> 08:54.000
Your leather satchel.

08:54.067 --> 08:55.067
Oh, here.

08:55.133 --> 08:56.700
Yeah. Here we go.

08:56.767 --> 08:57.733
Ahem.

08:58.800 --> 08:59.733
See?

08:59.800 --> 09:01.300
Wow.

09:01.367 --> 09:02.300
You want to buy one?

09:02.367 --> 09:03.867
That's your business?

09:03.933 --> 09:05.333
Selling bags to me and Des?

09:05.400 --> 09:06.333
[chuckle]

09:06.400 --> 09:07.600
Very funny.

09:07.667 --> 09:09.133
I hear you're heading
back into Braeband.

09:09.200 --> 09:10.533
Christ, don't blow
your brains out.

09:10.600 --> 09:11.900
I thought
you hated that place.

09:11.967 --> 09:13.733
You still owe me £8,000.

09:13.800 --> 09:15.267
I'm going to go get
the tuna off the grill.

09:15.333 --> 09:16.933
You all right, Sha?

09:17.000 --> 09:18.433
You look a bit distracted.

09:18.500 --> 09:20.467
Huh? No, fine.

09:20.533 --> 09:23.767
You guys should head
over to Spain for a break.

09:23.833 --> 09:25.367
Get a bit of sun.

09:25.433 --> 09:27.167
We have to settle
things back home first.

09:27.233 --> 09:28.933
We've put the house
on the market.

09:29.000 --> 09:31.200
Your father was having a bit
of trouble with the stairs.

09:31.267 --> 09:32.967
We saw a bungalow
in town.

09:33.033 --> 09:34.300
What?

09:34.367 --> 09:36.700
Next door to Margaret Flynn's
eldest daughter.

09:36.767 --> 09:39.533
Do you remember her? Siobhan.

09:39.600 --> 09:41.100
She's divorced now.

09:41.167 --> 09:43.133
She's living with a black
fella from Germany.

09:43.200 --> 09:45.800
Jesus. Why are you only
telling me this now?

09:45.867 --> 09:47.833
Well, Siobhan had
only just told me.

09:47.900 --> 09:49.900
No. About moving.

09:49.967 --> 09:51.600
You're terrible
communicators.

09:51.667 --> 09:53.833
If you're having trouble,
I'd like to help.

09:53.900 --> 09:55.100
But you have to tell me.

09:55.167 --> 09:57.133
We're not moving back here.

09:57.200 --> 09:59.533
I don't want to die
in Walthamstow.

09:59.600 --> 10:00.700
You're not going to die,

10:00.767 --> 10:01.900
and this isn't Walthamstow.

10:01.967 --> 10:03.800
Would you prefer to die
in Spain, Dad?

10:03.867 --> 10:05.933
Huh. Might be nice.

10:06.000 --> 10:07.833
Is there a phone here?

10:07.900 --> 10:11.033
Yeah. Yeah. You can use mine.
Who do you need to call?

10:11.100 --> 10:14.500
Let Carol know I won't
be home for dinner.

10:14.567 --> 10:17.533
She's a cranky old bitch
when I'm late.

10:23.800 --> 10:26.900
Mum said from about 6:30
he's pretty useless.

10:26.967 --> 10:28.367
He's like a toddler now.

10:28.433 --> 10:29.700
It's bonkers.

10:29.767 --> 10:31.700
It's tough being away
with all this going on.

10:31.767 --> 10:34.267
I mean, what if something
happens to Dad?

10:34.333 --> 10:36.433
Don't be stupid.
Nothing's going to
happen to him.

10:36.500 --> 10:38.367
And if it does,
it'll be a long,
grim march.

10:38.433 --> 10:39.533
A denouement.

10:39.600 --> 10:41.067
Ugh. Knob.

10:41.133 --> 10:42.933
You're in a shit mood
tonight.

10:43.000 --> 10:44.867
I know.

10:44.933 --> 10:48.600
I just found out
I'm, like, 99% barren.

10:48.667 --> 10:49.533
What?

10:49.600 --> 10:51.533
I started out
with 4 million eggs,

10:51.600 --> 10:55.000
clutches of eggs, and now
there's, like, a handful.

10:55.067 --> 10:56.767
I'm just an old crone.

10:56.833 --> 10:58.033
I should start
figuring out

10:58.100 --> 11:00.433
if I want to be buried
or cremated.

11:00.500 --> 11:03.300
Well, I think
that you should be buried

11:03.367 --> 11:05.733
because I'd like to have
somewhere to go and visit you.

11:05.800 --> 11:08.833
Bring Frankie and Muireann,
sit down, play my luge.

11:08.900 --> 11:10.967
Who cares?
No one knows you're old.

11:11.033 --> 11:13.267
No one can see your egg
pockets or whatever.

11:13.333 --> 11:14.767
We're lucky, genes-wise.

11:14.833 --> 11:16.600
No one would believe
Rob and I are the same age.

11:16.667 --> 11:17.833
He looks like shit.

11:17.900 --> 11:19.600
He doesn't look like shit.

11:19.667 --> 11:21.800
He's just a bit heavier
at the moment

11:21.867 --> 11:23.433
because he's stressed out

11:23.500 --> 11:25.467
and he's eaten a lot of coffee
toffee ice cream, okay?

11:25.533 --> 11:27.000
Give him a break.

11:33.600 --> 11:34.967
Come here.

11:35.033 --> 11:36.167
Ah, don't fuss.

11:36.233 --> 11:37.767
Just hugging you.

11:42.333 --> 11:43.967
I'll call you
when we get to Peg's.

11:44.033 --> 11:46.600
Call me any time.
I worry about you and him.

11:46.667 --> 11:47.600
Ugh.

11:55.933 --> 11:57.467
Sharon: Uhh.

11:57.533 --> 11:58.867
Are you okay?

11:58.933 --> 12:00.667
Yeah, I'm fi-- Oh, God.

12:00.733 --> 12:02.567
I'm just getting so old.

12:02.633 --> 12:03.967
Everyone's getting old.

12:04.033 --> 12:05.500
Frankie wipes
his own arse now.

12:05.567 --> 12:06.833
My eggs are dead.

12:06.900 --> 12:07.933
Well, honey, he doesn't--

12:08.000 --> 12:09.033
Okay, yeah, he wipes it,

12:09.100 --> 12:10.533
but he doesn't
wipe it clean.

12:10.600 --> 12:12.000
He just wipes it
around the place.

12:12.067 --> 12:13.800
I think
I'm having a hot flush.

12:13.867 --> 12:15.967
You're not having
a hot flush.

12:16.033 --> 12:18.367
It's probably
just a panic attack.

12:20.333 --> 12:22.800
You lads okay with me sticking
around for a few days?

12:27.067 --> 12:29.033
This is really good.

12:30.900 --> 12:32.067
What is it?

12:32.133 --> 12:33.700
Meat.
I mean beef.

12:33.767 --> 12:35.033
- Mm.
- I thought so.

12:35.100 --> 12:36.267
I had to hone
my culinary skills

12:36.333 --> 12:37.933
when Chris left.

12:38.000 --> 12:39.767
It's just me
and Jamie Oliver now.

12:39.833 --> 12:42.933
I just popped it in the
slow cooker, and voilà.

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
Voilà what?

12:45.067 --> 12:46.633
Falls off the bone.

12:48.000 --> 12:49.700
Hello, love.
Can I get you anything?

12:49.767 --> 12:50.867
No, thanks.

12:50.933 --> 12:52.833
Can you say hello
to Sharon and Rob?

12:52.900 --> 12:54.567
- Hello.
- Hi, Jeffrey.

12:54.633 --> 12:55.667
You've gotten tall.

12:55.733 --> 12:57.067
Before I forget.

13:00.267 --> 13:02.167
- For you.
- Oh, wow.

13:02.233 --> 13:03.767
When did this come out?
I didn't see this.

13:03.833 --> 13:06.133
Well, it came out on DVD
same time as streaming.

13:06.200 --> 13:09.633
Didn't get
a theatrical release
because it's arthouse.

13:09.700 --> 13:12.033
Would you like Jeffrey
to autograph it for you?

13:12.100 --> 13:14.000
- Fran
- For God's sake.

13:14.067 --> 13:16.300
I'm only saying
what they're thinking.

13:16.367 --> 13:18.500
You working on anything
at the moment, Jeffrey?

13:18.567 --> 13:19.867
Not really.

13:19.933 --> 13:22.000
He's just wrapped
in Woody Allen's new film.

13:22.067 --> 13:23.233
Robert Duvall
and Emma Watson

13:23.300 --> 13:25.033
play star-crossed
lovers in Vienna.

13:25.100 --> 13:26.767
I was worried. I won't lie.

13:26.833 --> 13:30.500
But they have on-set tutors
to, you know, keep an eye.

13:30.567 --> 13:32.633
Chaperones, you know.

13:32.700 --> 13:34.433
Right, what have you
got coming up next?

13:34.500 --> 13:36.667
Nothing interesting.
Mostly just American shit.

13:36.733 --> 13:39.300
- Right.
- Maybe if I had
a pair of tits,

13:39.367 --> 13:41.033
I'd have a chance of getting
on "Game of Thrones."

13:42.133 --> 13:44.000
No Star Wars, either.

13:44.067 --> 13:45.467
They're only interested
in women now,

13:45.533 --> 13:47.600
which I think is great,
but, you know, come on.

13:47.667 --> 13:49.733
Give it a rest.

13:52.533 --> 13:55.067
I just think he's not being
honest with himself

13:55.133 --> 13:56.600
or with her.

13:56.667 --> 13:59.300
When I asked him why he
smelled of piss that night,

13:59.367 --> 14:03.267
he said you'd pissed on him,
which is bullshit, right?

14:03.333 --> 14:05.000
If you piss yourself

14:05.067 --> 14:06.267
the first night back drinking,

14:06.333 --> 14:07.533
then you've got a problem.

14:07.600 --> 14:10.333
The likelihood of that
being a one-time thing--

14:10.400 --> 14:12.000
I don't think this is working.

14:15.800 --> 14:19.067
Well, I have good news.

14:20.300 --> 14:21.400
It is.

14:21.467 --> 14:23.867
I was thinking
about what you said.

14:23.933 --> 14:25.467
About having a baby?

14:25.533 --> 14:26.567
Yeah.

14:26.633 --> 14:28.167
I'm not going to do that.

14:28.233 --> 14:29.800
You don't want kids?

14:29.867 --> 14:31.100
No, no, I do.

14:31.167 --> 14:33.800
I mean, biologically
and psychologically,

14:33.867 --> 14:35.533
I want to be a dad.

14:35.600 --> 14:39.033
Frankie made Rob a paper
boat the other day.

14:39.100 --> 14:40.667
I mean, it was shitty.
It sank.

14:40.733 --> 14:45.000
But I'd like a little
person to make me a boat.

14:45.067 --> 14:46.867
Of course I would.

14:46.933 --> 14:47.967
But I know I shouldn't.

14:48.033 --> 14:50.833
My ingredients are bad.

14:50.900 --> 14:52.167
How are they bad?

14:52.233 --> 14:53.767
You speak fluent Russian.

14:53.833 --> 14:55.367
I am not a good person.

14:55.433 --> 14:57.633
And I've met a lot of people
along the way

14:57.700 --> 14:58.800
who agree with me.

15:00.200 --> 15:02.700
So I don't get
the little boat.

15:02.767 --> 15:04.600
And so what?

15:04.667 --> 15:07.233
You don't get everything
you want. Ha.

15:08.667 --> 15:09.767
I'm pregnant.

15:09.833 --> 15:12.900
That is wonderful news.

15:12.967 --> 15:17.400
So...cut to the chase.

15:17.467 --> 15:19.333
We invited you here
this evening

15:19.400 --> 15:22.400
to showcase my
slow cooker, obviously,

15:22.467 --> 15:27.533
and to say that, well,
because of the divorce,

15:27.600 --> 15:30.100
we have to do
some estate planning.

15:30.167 --> 15:32.800
And we wanted
to ask you two

15:32.867 --> 15:36.333
if you would consider being
legal guardians to Jeffrey.

15:36.400 --> 15:38.733
Look after him if we die.
If we both die.

15:38.800 --> 15:40.633
Wow.

15:40.700 --> 15:42.767
Oh. Right.

15:42.833 --> 15:44.800
Um, wow. Um...

15:44.867 --> 15:46.033
Okay.

15:46.100 --> 15:47.267
Well, that's--

15:47.333 --> 15:48.900
that's a lot to take in.

15:48.967 --> 15:50.000
- Um...
- I mean,

15:50.067 --> 15:52.200
may I ask why us?

15:52.267 --> 15:55.133
- Because we love you.
- We couldn't agree
on anyone else.

15:56.333 --> 15:57.900
Right.

15:57.967 --> 15:59.733
Well, I mean, that's
really flattering, right?

15:59.800 --> 16:03.700
Oh, yeah. I mean, you know,
for me, it's yes.

16:03.767 --> 16:06.533
I don't want to speak
on Sharon's behalf, but--

16:06.600 --> 16:07.833
Right, yeah. I mean,

16:07.900 --> 16:10.533
for me, it's, um...
But I just think,

16:10.600 --> 16:12.767
out of respect for
the question and for you guys,

16:12.833 --> 16:15.267
it's something, you know,
we should discuss at home.

16:15.333 --> 16:18.733
Take your time.
Not too long, though.

16:18.800 --> 16:20.167
[chuckle]

16:20.233 --> 16:22.600
We thought you just
wanted a foursome.

16:29.567 --> 16:33.067
How about Fran
puts on some tea,

16:33.133 --> 16:34.367
I have a piss,

16:34.433 --> 16:37.233
and then we come back
and you say yes?

16:37.300 --> 16:39.367
But we're not--
we're not saying no.

16:39.433 --> 16:41.400
I think what we're
probably saying is that,

16:41.467 --> 16:42.833
you know,
we just need time to--

16:42.900 --> 16:44.000
- Douglas: I'm home.
- [door closes]

16:44.067 --> 16:45.067
Is that Douglas?

16:45.133 --> 16:46.767
You're early.

16:46.833 --> 16:49.300
Yeah, finished up early,
so I thought I'd pop back

16:49.367 --> 16:52.633
to see if the Warsaw Pact
was drawing to a close.

16:56.333 --> 16:58.000
Fran [chuckling]: Mm.

16:58.067 --> 16:59.667
Douglas: Mm. [kiss] Mm.

17:02.233 --> 17:06.133
Oh, um, this is
Sharon and Rob.

17:06.200 --> 17:09.267
Good friends.
And this is Douglas.

17:09.333 --> 17:10.700
- Hi.
- Hi.

17:10.767 --> 17:11.967
Aloha.

17:12.033 --> 17:14.300
And Chris.

17:14.367 --> 17:16.700
This is Douglas. Ahem.

17:16.767 --> 17:18.233
Nice to meet you, Chris.

17:19.167 --> 17:21.933
Well, there you are.

17:22.000 --> 17:23.700
There's some meat--

17:23.767 --> 17:26.500
uh, beef in the slow cooker
if you're hungry.

17:26.567 --> 17:30.100
No, thanks. I'd like to die
with all my own teeth.

17:35.633 --> 17:37.100
Have you seen this?

17:37.167 --> 17:39.467
Uh, no, no.
We just got it.

17:43.500 --> 17:46.700
So...where is
the little laddy?

17:49.900 --> 17:51.500
Rob: We should maybe say yes

17:51.567 --> 17:53.167
because are both
of them going to die

17:53.233 --> 17:54.400
in the next three years?

17:54.467 --> 17:56.467
No way.
And then we'll have done

17:56.533 --> 17:58.133
something wonderful
for them,

17:58.200 --> 17:59.533
so they'll let us stay

17:59.600 --> 18:02.067
at their beach house
in Biarritz probably.

18:02.133 --> 18:04.300
Yeah, but what if she
dies of cancer

18:04.367 --> 18:07.433
and then he dies a year later
of a different kind of cancer?

18:07.500 --> 18:09.833
Or if he gets hit
by a rubbish truck?

18:09.900 --> 18:11.200
You know,
or what if he doesn't die?

18:11.267 --> 18:12.833
What if he's just a vegetable

18:12.900 --> 18:14.400
or has to live
in an iron lung?

18:14.467 --> 18:16.500
I don't want to look
after Chris and Jeffrey.

18:16.567 --> 18:17.633
I mean, I love Chris,

18:17.700 --> 18:19.933
but I don't want
to have to wash his balls.

18:20.000 --> 18:21.767
- Really?
- No. Look,

18:21.833 --> 18:24.333
I'm just saying we need
to read the small print.
What do we get?

18:24.400 --> 18:26.533
Yeah? I mean,
we know what they get.

18:26.600 --> 18:28.867
They get their son
taken care of.
What do we get?

18:28.933 --> 18:30.267
Let's ask them.

18:30.333 --> 18:31.867
I mean, maybe
we get their house.

18:31.933 --> 18:33.300
You know,
we'd have to maintain

18:33.367 --> 18:35.200
Jeffrey's
deluxe lifestyle.

18:35.267 --> 18:37.600
Yeah, because, like,
what if Daniel Radcliffe

18:37.667 --> 18:39.733
and Susan Sarandon
want to come over?

18:39.800 --> 18:41.333
You know they can't come here.

18:41.400 --> 18:43.600
They should let us move in
to their house when they die.

18:43.667 --> 18:46.900
Okay, so we say we'll do it
if they sign a contract

18:46.967 --> 18:51.100
giving us a sort of posthumous
dowry of their house.

18:51.167 --> 18:52.767
Yeah, but just temporarily

18:52.833 --> 18:54.633
until Jeffrey turns 18--

18:54.700 --> 18:55.767
or 21.

18:55.833 --> 18:57.067
Jesus.

18:57.133 --> 18:59.033
Talk about two birds
with one stone.

18:59.100 --> 19:00.300
How do you mean?

19:00.367 --> 19:02.400
Well, you were worried
about no eggs.

19:02.467 --> 19:04.167
Now you're going
to get an extra son,

19:04.233 --> 19:06.733
and Susan Sarandon's
coming over for dinner.

19:08.667 --> 19:10.300
What?

19:10.367 --> 19:11.733
What--

19:11.800 --> 19:12.933
Why don't you say something

19:13.000 --> 19:15.767
to make me feel better
about my no eggs?

19:15.833 --> 19:17.067
What if you
went to the doctor

19:17.133 --> 19:18.633
and they were like,
"Oh, bad luck,

19:18.700 --> 19:20.300
you've no sperm left in you"?

19:20.367 --> 19:22.133
What you blow
into your wife from now on

19:22.200 --> 19:25.767
will just be, you know,
dead glop.

19:25.833 --> 19:28.200
I'd say that's terrific.

19:28.267 --> 19:29.533
No, you wouldn't.

19:29.600 --> 19:31.500
And what if you have
the urge to make more babies?

19:31.567 --> 19:34.467
You know? What if your body's
like, "I need more babies,"

19:34.533 --> 19:36.967
and my egg-less body can't
do it, and so you leave me?

19:37.033 --> 19:38.500
Do you not listen to me?

19:38.567 --> 19:40.667
I would love you more
if you had no eggs.

19:40.733 --> 19:43.467
I want to be with you,
our current children,

19:43.533 --> 19:44.700
and that's it.

19:45.833 --> 19:47.567
I'm rotting, Rob.

19:47.633 --> 19:48.867
Me, too.

19:48.933 --> 19:50.367
And that's fine.

19:50.433 --> 19:52.867
Look, your body
is slowly turning off,

19:52.933 --> 19:54.300
and that's upsetting to you,

19:54.367 --> 19:56.267
but it's supposed to happen.

19:56.333 --> 19:57.767
And if it's any consolation,

19:57.833 --> 20:01.267
your pussy still tastes
and smells delicious.

20:01.333 --> 20:03.100
And not all of them do.

20:04.133 --> 20:06.267
Honestly,
that really means a lot.

20:09.267 --> 20:11.300
What about Douglas,
though?

20:11.367 --> 20:13.167
Holy shit.

20:13.233 --> 20:15.933
You can tell he sucks
right out of the gate.

20:16.000 --> 20:16.967
Yeah.

20:17.033 --> 20:18.467
[knock on door]

20:18.533 --> 20:19.433
What?

20:19.500 --> 20:20.833
Fergal:
Can you give me a hand?

20:20.900 --> 20:22.200
I can't get
the printer working.

20:24.933 --> 20:26.700
What do you need fucking
printing anyway?

20:26.767 --> 20:27.867
Nothing.

20:27.933 --> 20:29.700
Huh?

20:29.767 --> 20:30.933
I don't need
anything printed.

20:31.000 --> 20:32.667
I just needed to talk to you.

20:32.733 --> 20:34.733
I've run away from Spain.

20:34.800 --> 20:36.433
- What?
- I want to leave Spain,

20:36.500 --> 20:37.767
and if Mallandra
won't come back,

20:37.833 --> 20:38.933
then I'm going
to leave Mallandra.

20:39.000 --> 20:40.367
She's horrible in Spain.

20:40.433 --> 20:41.867
She walks around naked now,

20:41.933 --> 20:43.367
all comfortable
with her body.

20:43.433 --> 20:45.567
Also, some of the lads
from the local cantina

20:45.633 --> 20:48.067
took me to a bull fight,
and I fainted.

20:48.133 --> 20:50.667
So I'm pretty much
blacklisted now socially.

20:50.733 --> 20:52.267
Just need to figure out a way

20:52.333 --> 20:53.867
to get the girls out
of the country legally.

20:53.933 --> 20:56.500
[laughing]

20:56.567 --> 20:57.667
It's not funny.

20:57.733 --> 20:59.267
No, but, I mean,

20:59.333 --> 21:00.833
I can see how it's
not funny to you,

21:00.900 --> 21:03.400
but can you see how it's
quite funny to me?

21:03.467 --> 21:05.333
- No.
- Well, look, you
can't stay here.

21:05.400 --> 21:07.833
- Where am I supposed to go?
- Where did you say
your girls were again?

21:07.900 --> 21:10.000
- Spain.
- Well, there you go.

21:30.467 --> 21:31.767
Oh, shit.

21:45.800 --> 21:47.333
[doorbell rings]

21:51.467 --> 21:53.233
I think you know why I'm here.

21:53.300 --> 21:56.400
I'm here to bully you
into being guardian to my kid.

21:56.467 --> 21:58.733
It's you guys
or ape man Douglas,

21:58.800 --> 22:00.500
and I'd re-animate
from the dead

22:00.567 --> 22:03.400
to stop that fucker ever
getting his mitts on him.

22:04.367 --> 22:07.433
Adopt my son when I die.

22:08.700 --> 22:10.900
Mate, I'm pretty sure
I can smell booze on you.

22:10.967 --> 22:12.433
Don't you not drink?

22:12.500 --> 22:14.567
I have the odd drink now.

22:14.633 --> 22:17.067
Okay.

22:17.133 --> 22:18.200
Does Sharon know?

22:18.267 --> 22:20.567
I have the odd
private drink.

22:20.633 --> 22:22.700
Right.

22:22.767 --> 22:24.033
You want to talk about it?

22:24.100 --> 22:25.633
Not really.

22:25.700 --> 22:28.200
I mean, I didn't drink,
and now I slightly drink.

22:28.267 --> 22:30.200
But look, you don't
need to bully me.

22:30.267 --> 22:32.000
We'll be guardians
to your son.

22:32.067 --> 22:33.400
There's just
some fine print--

22:33.467 --> 22:35.700
No, you've got a lot
on your plate.

22:35.767 --> 22:36.867
Let's park it.

22:36.933 --> 22:38.333
Well, why? That's--

22:38.400 --> 22:40.200
For a good few years you told
me you shouldn't drink,

22:40.267 --> 22:42.100
and I took your word for it.

22:42.167 --> 22:45.733
And now you're drinking.

22:45.800 --> 22:49.133
Well, okay. But, like,
look, can you--

22:49.200 --> 22:50.667
I won't tell Sharon.

22:50.733 --> 22:52.000
Someone will, though.

22:52.067 --> 22:54.333
May be a good idea
if it was you.

22:56.767 --> 22:58.533
H-Hang on a second,
Chris.

22:58.600 --> 23:01.100
Listen, I know
what you're thinking,
and I just want to say

23:01.167 --> 23:04.333
I don't know I had a problem
with booze itself.

23:04.400 --> 23:06.300
I mean, yeah,
sure I had problems.

23:06.367 --> 23:08.700
Can you trace it to booze?
You know, I'm not so sure.

23:08.767 --> 23:10.200
You know,
I was younger then.

23:11.100 --> 23:12.533
Oh, fuck!

23:12.600 --> 23:15.433
Ohh. Oh, this is--

23:15.500 --> 23:18.133
I twisted my ankle
a few weeks ago,

23:18.200 --> 23:19.667
so that's what--
and it's still--

23:19.733 --> 23:21.033
so that's what that was.

23:21.100 --> 23:22.433
I know
it would be convenient

23:22.500 --> 23:25.433
for your little theory,
but I'm fine.

23:25.500 --> 23:27.800
I'm actually
doing really well.

23:28.867 --> 23:30.400
Hi, Pearl.

23:40.533 --> 23:44.067
