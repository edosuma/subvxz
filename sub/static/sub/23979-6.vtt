00:01.160 --> 00:02.958
Previously on
"Life Sentence"...

00:03.000 --> 00:04.570
What is happening?
Is there an emergency?

00:04.630 --> 00:06.200
There's a new oncologist
on the floor, and he's...

00:06.250 --> 00:07.456
So hot.

00:07.500 --> 00:09.298
Hi.
Dr. William Grant.

00:09.340 --> 00:11.217
Stella Abbott, volunteer.

00:11.260 --> 00:13.422
Stella: I helped Lizzie
get into a writers' retreat

00:13.470 --> 00:14.835
so she could finally focus.

00:14.890 --> 00:16.927
You can do better
than selling ADHD meds

00:16.970 --> 00:18.881
to desperate
soccer moms.

00:18.930 --> 00:20.011
It's not like
I haven't thought about

00:20.060 --> 00:21.266
doing other things.

00:21.310 --> 00:22.596
We can't ignore this
anymore.

00:22.640 --> 00:24.347
I knew he sold weed
years ago.

00:24.400 --> 00:25.856
I didn't know
about the pills.

00:25.900 --> 00:28.767
Wes: When I bumped into you,
everything changed.

00:28.820 --> 00:30.857
Pippa: I flew to Paris
and went to that restaurant

00:30.900 --> 00:32.311
where we'd made
the reservation.

00:32.360 --> 00:33.566
Stella: You were there?
In Paris?

00:33.610 --> 00:34.907
Wes:
I was supposed to marry her.

00:34.950 --> 00:36.941
Five days
before I met you.

00:36.990 --> 00:38.731
How long have you
been married? Six months.

00:38.780 --> 00:40.748
It's a shame I didn't meet you
seven months ago.

00:40.790 --> 00:43.782
I'm not sticking this out
to fulfill a promise.

00:43.830 --> 00:45.241
I want to be here.
With you.

00:45.290 --> 00:47.031
I want to be here with you,
too.

00:49.670 --> 00:51.081
Stella: I'm really glad
we're doing this.

00:51.130 --> 00:53.087
We haven't seen a movie
in ages.

00:53.130 --> 00:55.007
Well, I thought
it would be a good idea

00:55.050 --> 00:56.290
to "Forget Paris"

00:56.340 --> 00:58.297
and take a little
"Roman Holiday."

00:59.810 --> 01:01.175
What's this movie about,
again?

01:01.220 --> 01:04.974
Audrey Hepburn rides
a tiny scooter around Rome.

01:05.019 --> 01:08.149
Ooh! Say no more.
I'm gonna love this.

01:09.020 --> 01:10.317
Wes: Ooh.

01:10.360 --> 01:12.180
I told you
if you wanted popcorn

01:12.230 --> 01:13.561
to get your own.

01:13.610 --> 01:15.021
The tub's bigger
than you are.

01:15.070 --> 01:19.735
And yet,
I shall consume it all.

01:21.830 --> 01:24.492
[ Man speaking indistinctly
on screen |

01:24.540 --> 01:25.826
Hey.

01:25.870 --> 01:28.282
Thank you for being
so understanding

01:28.330 --> 01:29.741
about the whole Pippa thing.

01:29.790 --> 01:31.372
I love you.

01:31.420 --> 01:33.252
I love you, too.

01:33.300 --> 01:35.086
I'd love for you
to be quiet.

01:35.130 --> 01:36.336
Sorry.

01:36.380 --> 01:37.791
We just went through
a really trying time

01:37.840 --> 01:39.046
in our relationship
SO -- Woman: Shh!

01:39.090 --> 01:41.309
Oh, uh, I'm sorry.
I had no idea.

01:41.350 --> 01:43.341
Maybe we should stop the movie,
turn on the lights,

01:43.390 --> 01:45.222
and you two
can act out your drama

01:45.270 --> 01:46.476
for the whole theater?

01:46.520 --> 01:47.510
Okay, relax.

01:47.560 --> 01:49.392
It's just the trailers...

01:49.440 --> 01:52.819
for movies that came out,
like, 60 years ago.

01:52.860 --> 01:55.238
Stella: Wes and I
weren't the only ones

01:55.280 --> 01:57.487
trying to reset
our relationship.

01:57.530 --> 01:59.692
"Only the chickens
and Henrietta's family

01:59.740 --> 02:01.447
knew the real answer."

02:01.490 --> 02:03.868
Now that she was home
from the writer's retreat,

02:03.910 --> 02:05.651
Lizzie and Diego were trying
to do the same thing.

02:05.700 --> 02:06.952
"...to save their hides.

02:07.000 --> 02:08.866
For even though
she was a chicken,

02:08.919 --> 02:10.490
she was family.

02:10.539 --> 02:11.951
Mama?
Yeah?

02:12.000 --> 02:14.549
Did you really write
that story? I did.

02:14.590 --> 02:16.627
Just for
the two of you guys

02:16.670 --> 02:18.798
because I missed you
so much.

02:18.840 --> 02:20.581
I'll read you another one
tomorrow, okay?

02:20.640 --> 02:23.007
But for now,
it's time for bed.

02:23.060 --> 02:24.630
Let's go.

02:28.560 --> 02:30.050
I'm gonna
put them to bed,

02:30.100 --> 02:31.397
and then I'm gonna
put you to bed.

02:31.440 --> 02:33.932
Okay.

02:34.730 --> 02:36.778
I am so happy
that you're finally home.

02:36.820 --> 02:38.640
I'm so happy to be home.
Oh, yeah?

02:38.700 --> 02:41.567
<i>Ooh.
Ooh! Wine!</i>

02:41.620 --> 02:42.860
Nice.

02:42.910 --> 02:44.730
Thank you guys
for letting me stay here

02:44.790 --> 02:48.249
because I am lonely.

02:48.290 --> 02:50.076
Breaking up
with your girlfriend

02:50.120 --> 02:51.827
who's also
your best friend...

02:51.880 --> 02:53.166
really sucks.

02:56.300 --> 02:57.256
Hmm.

02:58.380 --> 02:59.836
Oh, smells like dirt.

03:01.220 --> 03:03.257
So, let's Netflix and chill,
kids.

03:03.300 --> 03:04.426
Mom.
Yeah?

03:04.470 --> 03:05.710
Do you know
what that means?

03:05.760 --> 03:07.012
I do not.

03:08.640 --> 03:11.268
Aiden was trying to make
a fresh start, too.

03:11.310 --> 03:12.436
Aiden, all you have to do

03:12.480 --> 03:13.891
is finish filling out
this profile.

03:13.940 --> 03:15.396
Look.

03:15.440 --> 03:16.817
It's not that I don't want
to go legit, guys.

03:16.860 --> 03:18.396
I do, but the truth is,

03:18.440 --> 03:20.351
there's no reason anyone
would ever want to hire me.

03:20.400 --> 03:22.619
That's not true.
Really?

03:22.660 --> 03:25.027
That's exactly what the manager
at Better Buy said.

03:25.080 --> 03:26.445
Aiden, you're smart.

03:26.490 --> 03:27.616
And resourceful.

03:27.660 --> 03:28.900
If I was resourceful,

03:28.950 --> 03:30.406
would I still be
living with my father,

03:30.460 --> 03:31.825
letting him pay
all my bills?

03:31.870 --> 03:33.201
Yes.

03:33.250 --> 03:34.411
That's the definition
of resourceful.

03:34.460 --> 03:36.167
Guys, let's face it.

03:36.210 --> 03:37.792
I'm unemployable.

03:37.840 --> 03:39.160
You don't have a choice,
Aiden.

03:39.210 --> 03:41.042
You want to keep
living here for free,

03:41.090 --> 03:42.501
you have to get
a real job.

03:42.550 --> 03:43.836
Well, that's just great.

03:43.890 --> 03:45.676
I'm gonna take
that ultimatum,

03:45.720 --> 03:47.711
hop on my unicorn,
and ride on down

03:47.770 --> 03:49.886
to the Department
of Magical Thinking,

03:49.930 --> 03:52.729
where they hand out
government jobs building rainbows.

03:57.570 --> 03:58.640
That's not funny.

03:58.690 --> 04:00.317
Wasn't funny.

04:00.360 --> 04:02.692
Hey, guys,
I got no references,

04:02.740 --> 04:05.311
no job history,
and no experience.

04:05.370 --> 04:07.111
Who in the world's
ever gonna hire me?

04:09.290 --> 04:11.156
The coffee shop.

04:11.210 --> 04:12.609
Duh!

04:12.670 --> 04:14.206
I can't believe I didn't
think of this sooner.

04:14.250 --> 04:15.820
I had none of those things
either,

04:15.880 --> 04:17.620
and they still hired me.

04:17.670 --> 04:18.956
Plus, you're family,

04:19.000 --> 04:20.582
so that's got to count
for something.

04:20.630 --> 04:22.587
I find nepotism
repulsive.

04:22.630 --> 04:24.507
Doesn't your father
own this coffee shop?

04:24.550 --> 04:26.507
Yes, and he made me
interview for my job

04:26.550 --> 04:28.132
like I was
a complete stranger.

04:28.180 --> 04:30.638
Look.

04:30.680 --> 04:32.887
My brother
is a great guy.

04:32.940 --> 04:35.227
Is that him?
Yeah.

04:35.270 --> 04:36.476
And I'm telling you,

04:36.520 --> 04:37.476
he would make
the best barista.

04:37.520 --> 04:38.817
He's such a people person.

04:38.860 --> 04:40.931
He's good at smiling
and winking

04:40.990 --> 04:42.697
and handing people
things in cups.

04:42.740 --> 04:44.196
Just...stop.

04:44.240 --> 04:45.696
You had me at
how hot his face is.

04:45.740 --> 04:46.810
He can have the job.

04:46.870 --> 04:47.860
Oh, my God.

04:47.910 --> 04:49.696
Thank --
Oh! Not a hugger.

04:49.740 --> 04:52.710
Oh. I'm sorry.

04:52.750 --> 04:55.367
Finley,
meet my brother, Aiden.

04:55.420 --> 04:57.957
Aiden, meet Finley,
your new boss.

04:58.000 --> 05:00.207
Welcome aboard,
handsome.

05:00.250 --> 05:02.378
- That killer smile
is part of your uniform,

05:02.420 --> 05:05.082
and I expect you to wear it
to work every single day.

05:05.130 --> 05:07.212
Ooh. Anything you say,
boss lady.

05:07.260 --> 05:08.716
Oh.

05:08.760 --> 05:10.637
Hey, I don't have to wear
this stupid hat, do I?

05:10.680 --> 05:11.636
Oh. No.

05:11.680 --> 05:13.136
We just make Stella wear it

05:13.180 --> 05:14.636
because she's got such
an oddly shaped head.

05:15.730 --> 05:17.892
No, I don't.

05:17.940 --> 05:21.433
Finley's insults aside,
I was really killing it today,

05:21.480 --> 05:22.982
which probably
isn't a good thing to say

05:23.030 --> 05:24.236
at a hospital.

05:24.280 --> 05:25.850
Hey.

05:25.900 --> 05:27.402
How's it going,
"Mighty Mouse"?

05:27.450 --> 05:28.611
Mighty Mouse?

05:28.660 --> 05:29.730
Is that supposed to be
my nickname?

05:29.780 --> 05:30.861
When did
I get a nickname?

05:30.910 --> 05:31.729
Just now.

05:31.790 --> 05:33.076
Just gave it to you.

05:33.120 --> 05:34.827
Well, I'm great.
Really killing it today.

05:34.870 --> 05:37.077
Okay, that's not a good
thing to say at a hospital. Mm.

05:37.120 --> 05:38.918
Dr. Grant: But I am glad
that you're having a good day,

05:38.960 --> 05:40.450
and I think your day
is about to get better.

05:40.500 --> 05:42.377
I just found out
that Sadie got accepted

05:42.420 --> 05:44.081
into Dr. Friedman's
clinical trial.

05:44.130 --> 05:45.165
Are you serious?

05:46.180 --> 05:47.750
Oh, my God.

05:47.800 --> 05:49.382
That's amazing!

05:49.430 --> 05:50.716
Yeah.

05:56.810 --> 05:58.517
Oh, oh, oh, oh

05:58.560 --> 05:59.607
Oh, oh, oh, oh

05:59.650 --> 06:00.799
Oh, oh, oh, oh, ah, ah

06:00.860 --> 06:02.771
A little bit dangerous

06:02.820 --> 06:03.855
Oh, oh, oh, oh

06:03.900 --> 06:05.390
Oh, oh, oh, oh

06:05.440 --> 06:06.987
Oh, oh, oh, oh, ah, ah

06:07.030 --> 06:07.815
I'm a little bit dangerous
Oh, Stella.

06:07.860 --> 06:09.521
Stella.

06:09.570 --> 06:10.901
Dr. Grant: Stella.

06:10.950 --> 06:12.111
You okay?

06:12.160 --> 06:13.321
Hmm? Yeah.

06:13.370 --> 06:15.281
N

06:15.330 --> 06:19.119
You got a little drool here. Oh.

06:19.170 --> 06:20.569
I was afraid you were
having a stroke.

06:20.630 --> 06:22.587
Mnh-mnh.
No. I-I'm good.

06:22.630 --> 06:24.041
I'm great.

06:24.090 --> 06:25.956
I'm just having
a sexual fantasy

06:26.010 --> 06:28.297
about a man
who isn't my husband.

06:28.340 --> 06:31.549
Don't worry about a thing

06:31.600 --> 06:35.309
You'll learn to live again

06:35.350 --> 06:37.227
You're gonna learn
to live again

06:37.270 --> 06:41.059
Oh, oh, oh

06:41.110 --> 06:44.228
Maybe that was my subconscious
getting revenge on Wes.

06:44.270 --> 06:46.523
But...
what if it was more?

06:46.570 --> 06:47.640
Just to be clear,

06:47.690 --> 06:49.272
nothing actually
happened?

06:49.320 --> 06:50.355
It was just a fantasy?

06:50.410 --> 06:51.980
Right.

06:53.490 --> 06:54.651
<i>- Butwhatif
it means something?</i>

06:54.700 --> 06:56.748
I-I mean,
I had told myself

06:56.790 --> 07:00.078
that things between me and Wes
were fine after Pippa,

07:00.120 --> 07:01.622
but...

07:01.670 --> 07:02.990
maybe they're not?

07:03.040 --> 07:05.543
Or maybe you had a fantasy
about Dr. Grant

07:05.590 --> 07:07.968
because he's hot
and you have eyes.

07:08.010 --> 07:11.219
Either way,
I want it to stop.

07:11.260 --> 07:12.921
So how do I make it stop?

07:12.970 --> 07:15.007
The heart wants
what the heart wants.

07:15.060 --> 07:17.711
Well, my heart wants Wes. Good.

07:17.770 --> 07:20.011
So maybe this was just
a one-time thing,

07:20.060 --> 07:21.892
like a little blip
on the radar.

07:21.940 --> 07:23.101
Yes. Absolutely.

07:23.150 --> 07:25.357
That is exactly
what that was.

07:25.400 --> 07:26.435
It was a blip.

07:26.480 --> 07:27.527
It was less than a blip --

07:27.570 --> 07:30.107
a bloop or a bleep.

07:30.150 --> 07:32.699
Dr. Grant might've been
my one-time fantasy,

07:32.740 --> 07:34.697
but Wes is
my lifetime reality,

07:34.740 --> 07:37.323
and I am going to make
my reality fantastic.

07:37.370 --> 07:39.156
Well, that's what marriage
is all about.

07:39.200 --> 07:41.362
You know, it's easy to
fantasize about what could be,

07:41.420 --> 07:44.958
but it is hard work
to make the best of what is...

07:45.840 --> 07:46.989
What are you guys
talking about?

07:47.050 --> 07:48.506
Nothing. I got to go.

07:48.550 --> 07:49.961
Late for work.
Aiden's first day. Bye.

07:51.760 --> 07:53.831
So...

07:53.890 --> 07:55.255
what were you
talking about?

07:55.300 --> 07:56.677
Oh...
you don't want to know.

07:56.720 --> 07:57.755
Okay.

07:57.810 --> 07:58.959
But, I mean,
just to be sure,

07:59.020 --> 08:00.260
you should probably
just tell me.

08:00.310 --> 08:02.381
I promise you,
you don't want to know.

08:04.650 --> 08:07.108
But I kind of do, though.

08:07.150 --> 08:08.936
Finley:
And that is how we do it.

08:14.660 --> 08:17.618
Aah!

08:17.660 --> 08:19.901
Having a real job sucks.

08:19.950 --> 08:22.282
I can't believe people do this
every single day.

08:22.330 --> 08:25.789
But I guess that's how
the other half lives.

08:25.830 --> 08:28.299
No, this is
how everyone lives.

08:28.340 --> 08:30.251
You'll get used to it.
It just takes time.

08:30.300 --> 08:32.928
Now, if you'll excuse me,

08:32.970 --> 08:35.506
I'm gonna go home
and seduce my husband.

08:36.850 --> 08:38.466
I am not sure
why I just told you that.

08:38.510 --> 08:40.386
Sometimes my mouth starts
before I can stop.

08:44.650 --> 08:46.186
Hey. New guy.

08:46.230 --> 08:48.688
Those lattes you ruined
are coming out of your tips.

08:48.730 --> 08:50.778
Oh, you are so lucky
you're hot,

08:50.820 --> 08:51.935
or you'd be out of here.

08:54.150 --> 08:55.652
Aiden.

08:55.700 --> 08:56.906
Denise.

08:56.950 --> 08:57.940
What are you doing here?

08:57.990 --> 09:00.038
I came to get a coffee.

09:00.080 --> 09:01.570
"Cause this is
a coffee shop.

09:02.540 --> 09:04.781
So, you working here now?

09:04.830 --> 09:06.958
Yeah. It's my first day.

09:07.000 --> 09:08.582
The apron's...cute.

09:08.630 --> 09:11.122
No, it isn't.
No, it really isn't.

09:12.800 --> 09:14.757
Look, I've been meaning
to thank you.

09:14.800 --> 09:15.870
Oh, there's no need.

09:15.930 --> 09:17.580
The sex was good for me,
too.

09:18.850 --> 09:21.842
No, not for that.

09:21.890 --> 09:23.801
You know, those pills
that you sold me

09:23.850 --> 09:25.887
helped me help Bryce
win the Science Fair.

09:25.940 --> 09:27.726
You're a total lifesaver.

09:27.770 --> 09:29.306
I'm glad to be of service.

09:29.360 --> 09:30.725
Do you think maybe
you could hook me up again

09:30.770 --> 09:32.898
just because the Spelling Bee
is coming up

09:32.940 --> 09:35.238
and I just need an extra boost
to help him study?

09:35.280 --> 09:37.157
I'm sorry.

09:37.200 --> 09:39.111
I'm not really doing that
anymore.

09:39.160 --> 09:40.230
Please.

09:40.280 --> 09:41.441
I have never seen him
as happy

09:41.490 --> 09:42.946
as the day
he won the Science Fair.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.616
One last time.

09:51.250 --> 09:52.456
Guess it couldn't hurt

09:52.500 --> 09:54.753
to sell off
what's left of my stash.

09:59.220 --> 10:00.290
Hey, you.

10:00.350 --> 10:02.091
Hey yourself,

10:02.140 --> 10:03.596
How was your day?

10:03.640 --> 10:05.768
It was good.

10:05.810 --> 10:08.188
But it's about
to get better.

10:08.230 --> 10:09.265
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

10:09.310 --> 10:11.438
Is it raining outside?
Nope.

10:11.480 --> 10:13.107
Then why are you wearing
a raincoat?

10:13.150 --> 10:15.107
Can you please stop
asking questions.

10:15.150 --> 10:17.027
I'm sorry.
I'm just confused.

10:17.070 --> 10:18.697
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh

10:18.740 --> 10:22.199
You got what I want,
you're not what I need

10:24.830 --> 10:28.869
Pour it over me
like gasoline

10:30.460 --> 10:33.669
Set the flame
and let it burn

10:33.710 --> 10:35.667
I don't know
what I was worried about.

10:35.710 --> 10:37.838
Wes and I were clearly
in a great place.

10:37.880 --> 10:41.384
Crazy is as crazy does,
sometimes I never learn

10:41.430 --> 10:44.502
Yeah

10:44.560 --> 10:47.177
You sure about that,
Mighty Mouse?

10:49.730 --> 10:52.392
What just happened?

10:52.440 --> 10:53.760
Nothing.

10:53.820 --> 10:54.969
Nothing.

11:02.120 --> 11:03.360
Elizabeth: Hey.

11:03.410 --> 11:05.321
Did you move
the mixing bowls?

11:05.370 --> 11:06.656
I didn't even know

11:06.700 --> 11:08.031
where they were
in the first place,

11:08.080 --> 11:10.993
so it would've been hard
for me to do that.

11:11.040 --> 11:13.839
So...you didn't do this
to our cabinets?

11:16.340 --> 11:19.082
Mom, did you rearrange
our cabinets?

11:19.130 --> 11:20.256
Oh, yeah.

11:20.300 --> 11:22.007
I couldn't sleep
last night.

11:22.050 --> 11:23.677
Organizing soothes me.

11:23.720 --> 11:26.678
So I started over here
with the spice cabinet.

11:26.720 --> 11:28.927
Everything
is color-coordinated.

11:28.980 --> 11:31.893
It goes from the spiciest
to the least spicy.

11:31.940 --> 11:33.476
I put the tastes
of the Far East

11:33.520 --> 11:34.646
all the way to the right,

11:34.690 --> 11:36.567
which is east on the map,

11:36.610 --> 11:38.851
so it makes perfect sense.

11:38.900 --> 11:40.390
No need to thank me.

11:40.450 --> 11:42.020
I'm on my way to yoga.

11:42.070 --> 11:43.367
Hatha!

11:43.410 --> 11:44.866
But I'll be back
before you know it.

11:44.910 --> 11:46.150
Namaste.

11:46.200 --> 11:47.440
Mama gotta go.

11:47.490 --> 11:48.946
Namaste, Mama got...

11:49.000 --> 11:51.207
That's a good one.

11:52.330 --> 11:54.458
Okay...

11:56.880 --> 11:58.120
She was just trying
to help.

11:58.170 --> 11:59.296
Hey.
Huh?

11:59.340 --> 12:00.796
Now that she's gone

12:00.840 --> 12:03.172
and the kids are at school,

12:03.220 --> 12:04.585
I think it's officially

12:04.640 --> 12:06.711
the first time
you and I have been alone

12:06.760 --> 12:07.807
since you got back.

12:07.850 --> 12:08.920
Hmm.

12:08.970 --> 12:10.222
You thinking
what I'm thinking?

12:10.270 --> 12:12.807
Ooh. Depends.

12:12.850 --> 12:14.432
Are you thinking about
telling me

12:14.480 --> 12:15.220
what you and Stella
were talking about yesterday?

12:15.270 --> 12:16.647
What? No!

12:16.690 --> 12:18.180
Seriously?
I'm a big boy.

12:18.230 --> 12:20.141
Whatever it is,
I can handle it.

12:20.190 --> 12:22.818
Fine, big boy.

12:22.860 --> 12:25.989
Stella had a sexual fantasy
about the hot doctor

12:26.030 --> 12:27.191
she works with
at the hospital.

12:27.240 --> 12:28.446
What?
Why would you tell me that?

12:28.490 --> 12:29.571
You know
I can't keep secrets.

12:29.620 --> 12:31.110
You should know better.

12:31.160 --> 12:32.366
You are my wife.

12:32.410 --> 12:34.993
It is your job to protect me
from myself.

12:35.040 --> 12:36.622
Baby, I tried.

12:36.670 --> 12:38.331
I tried.

12:40.510 --> 12:43.298
The thing nobody
tells you about fantasies

12:43.340 --> 12:45.297
is that they make
it extremely awkward

12:45.340 --> 12:47.638
to be around the person
you fantasized about.

12:47.680 --> 12:49.216
Dr. Chang:
Just like that.

12:49.260 --> 12:51.012
"Cause that's how it's
supposed -- Dr. Chang!

12:51.060 --> 12:53.017
Stella. Hey!
It's so great to see you.

12:53.060 --> 12:54.471
You need any help
in here?

12:54.520 --> 12:55.430
Actually, yes.

12:55.480 --> 12:56.970
The nurse had to step out,

12:57.020 --> 12:59.648
and Julie here
keeps taking off her EKG clip

12:59.690 --> 13:02.022
while I try
to finish her exam.

13:02.070 --> 13:04.277
It hurts my finger.
Yeah?

13:04.320 --> 13:06.197
Mine used to hurt, too,

13:06.240 --> 13:07.867
so I wore it
on my nose...

13:07.910 --> 13:08.945
like that.

13:10.830 --> 13:13.071
But it only works
if you wear it on your finger.

13:13.120 --> 13:14.610
See?

13:14.660 --> 13:16.628
Whoa.

13:16.670 --> 13:17.785
Who's that?

13:17.830 --> 13:19.707
Oh, that's Dr. Grant.

13:19.750 --> 13:21.047
He's new.

13:21.090 --> 13:22.751
All the nurses
are obsessed with him.

13:22.800 --> 13:25.258
He's super hot.

13:25.300 --> 13:27.382
Really? I...

13:27.430 --> 13:28.841
Mnh-mnh.
I don't see that.

13:28.890 --> 13:30.961
Why is your face
all red?

13:35.480 --> 13:38.859
It's Look with two O's --
L-O-0-K.

13:38.900 --> 13:40.891
So "look."

13:40.940 --> 13:42.226
Look.

13:43.820 --> 13:46.562
Lattes come out
over there.

13:49.070 --> 13:50.572
What can I get ya?

13:50.620 --> 13:51.906
A little help

13:51.950 --> 13:53.782
finishing my son's
shoe-box diorama.

13:53.830 --> 13:56.117
It's due tomorrow,
and I haven't even started.

13:56.160 --> 13:57.616
I'm not doing that
anymore.

13:57.670 --> 13:59.456
Denise said
you still had some.

13:59.500 --> 14:01.082
Look...
Look.

14:01.130 --> 14:04.009
Seriously, dude,
I'm not talking to you.

14:04.050 --> 14:06.291
Okay.

14:06.340 --> 14:07.751
I might have a few more,

14:07.800 --> 14:09.256
but I can't just
hand them to you

14:09.300 --> 14:10.347
over the counter.

14:12.970 --> 14:15.223
Put them on the bottom
of the coffee cup,

14:15.270 --> 14:18.183
and I'll pay you
in the tip jar.

14:19.730 --> 14:21.892
Huh.
Every time I let loose

14:21.940 --> 14:23.351
My daughter's
got a book report due.

14:23.400 --> 14:26.779
I get in situations

14:26.820 --> 14:28.902
Thank you.
I'm sorry, Mr. Officer

14:28.950 --> 14:30.190
Ooh

14:30.240 --> 14:32.117
Don't take me
to the station

14:32.160 --> 14:34.037
Run, run, run, run, run

14:34.080 --> 14:36.071
I have to sit through
my daughter's ballet recital.

14:37.000 --> 14:38.070
If I fall asleep again,

14:38.120 --> 14:39.360
my wife will divorce me.

14:39.420 --> 14:41.206
Run, run, run,
run, run

14:41.250 --> 14:42.376
Run, run,
run, run, run

14:42.420 --> 14:43.490
You saved my marriage.

14:43.550 --> 14:44.665
Whoa, Papa, run

14:44.710 --> 14:45.836
Ooh, ooh, ooh

14:45.880 --> 14:47.086
Whoa, Papa, run

14:47.130 --> 14:48.757
Ooh, ooh, ooh

14:48.800 --> 14:51.713
Whoa, Papa run

14:51.760 --> 14:53.558
Whoa, Papa run

14:55.140 --> 14:57.928
Great news.
Bryce won his spelling bee.

14:57.980 --> 14:59.937
He's going
to the State Finals.

14:59.980 --> 15:01.220
Can you please help me?

15:05.940 --> 15:07.897
Morning, son.

15:07.940 --> 15:09.021
Morning, pops.

15:09.070 --> 15:10.231
How's the new job going?

15:10.280 --> 15:11.770
Good.

15:11.820 --> 15:14.118
Oh, I'm glad
to hear that.

15:14.160 --> 15:15.867
I know I didn't give you
much of a choice, but...

15:15.910 --> 15:19.460
I'm proud of you
for cleaning up your act.

15:41.060 --> 15:43.017
Forgot my phone.

15:56.740 --> 15:59.198
I knew avoiding Dr. Grant
forever wasn't possible.

15:59.250 --> 16:00.399
Stella, hey.
There you are.

16:00.460 --> 16:01.609
Crap.

16:01.670 --> 16:03.627
But I really was trying.

16:04.790 --> 16:08.909
Hmm.

16:08.960 --> 16:10.371
What you looking for?

16:10.420 --> 16:14.505
Uh, I am I-looking
for these thingies...

16:14.550 --> 16:15.631
for Nurse Jill.

16:15.680 --> 16:17.000
Self-lubricating
catheters.

16:17.060 --> 16:18.767
Yeah.

16:20.730 --> 16:22.220
What the hell was that?

16:22.270 --> 16:23.726
Did I just giggle
and flip my hair at him?

16:23.770 --> 16:25.147
I can't giggle-flip him.

16:25.190 --> 16:26.680
I'm a married woman.

16:26.730 --> 16:28.721
Is there something I can
help you with, Dr. Grant?

16:28.780 --> 16:30.600
I'm just wondering
why you're avoiding me.

16:30.650 --> 16:32.891
And please call me Will.

16:32.950 --> 16:34.236
I'm not avoiding you.

16:34.280 --> 16:35.486
Yeah, you are.

16:35.530 --> 16:36.770
You're actually doing that
right now.

16:36.830 --> 16:37.865
That's literally
what you're doing.

16:37.910 --> 16:39.571
The direction
I'm walking in

16:39.620 --> 16:42.282
has nothing to do with you
or where you currently are.

16:42.330 --> 16:43.866
Dr. Chang! Hi.
Hi.

16:43.920 --> 16:45.991
Uh,
this is Dr. Will Grant.

16:46.040 --> 16:48.372
And you're the new doctor
who Stella's obsessed with.

16:49.670 --> 16:50.910
Oh. No.

16:50.960 --> 16:52.416
I said that the nurses

16:52.470 --> 16:53.790
are obsessed with you,
not me --

16:53.840 --> 16:55.581
big, but very important
difference.

16:55.640 --> 16:57.677
You know, I was just thinking
right now inside of my head.

16:57.720 --> 16:58.710
You're both doctors.

16:58.760 --> 17:00.091
You're both single,

17:00.140 --> 17:01.346
SO you probably have
a bunch in common.

17:01.390 --> 17:02.926
You should go out on a date

17:02.980 --> 17:04.345
with each other.

17:04.390 --> 17:06.347
I'm free tonight.
That sounds great.

17:06.400 --> 17:08.300
I was already planning
to eat dinner tonight.

17:08.359 --> 17:10.101
Now I can do it with you.

17:11.480 --> 17:13.608
Eat dinner, not do it...

17:13.650 --> 17:15.196
unless --
unless dinner goes well.

17:15.240 --> 17:16.355
Then all bets are off.

17:19.410 --> 17:20.444
See ya later.

17:20.490 --> 17:22.948
Bye.

17:23.000 --> 17:25.458
You are welcome.

17:28.960 --> 17:31.122
Elizabeth: Hey!
Hey.

17:31.170 --> 17:32.501
What's all this?

17:32.550 --> 17:34.291
It's a surprise
for Frankie and Fiona.

17:34.340 --> 17:35.580
Type 2 diabetes?

17:35.630 --> 17:36.882
Mom, if you give them
this much sugar,

17:36.930 --> 17:38.250
they're not gonna
want to eat dinner,

17:38.300 --> 17:39.847
and then they'll be up
half the night.

17:39.890 --> 17:40.755
Oh, don't worry.

17:40.810 --> 17:41.925
If they want to stay up

17:41.970 --> 17:43.472
a little bit
past their bedtime,

17:43.520 --> 17:44.726
I'll be up.

17:44.770 --> 17:46.477
Hey, kids!

17:48.770 --> 17:49.896
Okay.

17:49.940 --> 17:51.260
Since she got here,

17:51.320 --> 17:53.027
we have not been alone
long enough to have sex,

17:53.070 --> 17:54.686
she has reorganized
my entire house,

17:54.740 --> 17:56.560
and now she's making
the rules for the kids?

17:56.610 --> 17:58.442
You're right.

17:58.490 --> 17:59.651
You got to talk to her.

17:59.700 --> 18:00.986
Me?

18:01.030 --> 18:02.532
Well, while you were gone,

18:02.580 --> 18:05.322
she saved my life by
helping me out with the kids.

18:05.370 --> 18:07.498
I can't talk to her.

18:07.540 --> 18:08.780
I would seem ungrateful.

18:08.830 --> 18:10.412
So you want me
to seem ungrateful?

18:10.460 --> 18:12.371
That feels like
a trick question.

18:12.420 --> 18:13.581
Problem solved.

18:13.630 --> 18:15.416
We will talk to her
together.

18:18.180 --> 18:19.386
Great.

18:25.560 --> 18:27.688
I thought you might like
a late-night snack.

18:27.730 --> 18:28.720
Oh.

18:29.560 --> 18:31.551
You brought me gelato?!

18:31.610 --> 18:33.351
I brought you
three flavors of gelato

18:33.400 --> 18:35.027
'cause I know
how much you love it.

18:35.070 --> 18:38.199
Not as much
as I love you.

18:42.280 --> 18:43.532
Is everything okay?

18:43.580 --> 18:45.651
You've been acting
a little weird.

18:45.700 --> 18:46.690
Hmm. Have I?

18:46.750 --> 18:48.036
Well --

18:48.080 --> 18:49.491
Stella. Hey.

18:49.540 --> 18:51.781
Seriously, dude, that was
not your cue to appear.

18:52.630 --> 18:53.995
Did I say that out loud?

18:54.050 --> 18:55.165
Yeah.

18:55.210 --> 18:56.120
You sure you're okay?

18:56.170 --> 18:57.547
Mm-hmm.

18:57.590 --> 18:59.467
I thought she was having
a stroke the other day.

19:00.800 --> 19:03.007
And you --
you must be Wes, right?

19:03.050 --> 19:04.347
I'm Will Grant.

19:04.390 --> 19:05.801
Stella talks about you
all the time.

19:05.850 --> 19:07.227
Oh. Really?

19:07.270 --> 19:08.681
She -- She hasn't
mentioned you before.

19:08.730 --> 19:09.970
Yes, I have.

19:10.020 --> 19:11.340
This is
Sadie's new doctor.

19:11.400 --> 19:13.141
Oh!

19:13.190 --> 19:16.023
Sorry, I thought you'd have
a different sort of face.

19:17.690 --> 19:19.101
What -- What kind of face did
you think I was gonna have?

19:19.150 --> 19:22.370
Just, um, older,
more doctor-y.

19:22.410 --> 19:24.367
Yeah.
Dr. Chang: Hey, Wes!

19:24.410 --> 19:26.117
Oh.

19:26.160 --> 19:27.571
But I guess young
and attractive doctors

19:27.620 --> 19:28.997
are in good supply
around here.

19:29.040 --> 19:31.031
Which is why they're
all dating each other --

19:31.080 --> 19:32.627
these two included.

19:32.670 --> 19:34.377
Oh, you're dating
Dr. Chang? Well, yeah.

19:34.420 --> 19:35.831
Uh, we're going on
a date tonight.

19:35.880 --> 19:37.757
Stella set us up.

19:37.800 --> 19:39.871
Yeah, and they are perfect
for each other.

19:39.920 --> 19:41.251
I'm already picking out

19:41.300 --> 19:43.177
what my bridesmaid's dress
will look like,

19:43.220 --> 19:44.426
but no pressure.

19:44.470 --> 19:45.926
Don't do anything
I wouldn't do.

19:45.970 --> 19:47.677
That wasn't weird at all.

19:49.180 --> 19:51.899
Things were less complicated
at work.

19:51.940 --> 19:53.305
Aiden was crushing it,

19:53.350 --> 19:54.761
and the coffee shop
was running

19:54.810 --> 19:57.222
like a finely choreographed
ballet.

19:57.280 --> 20:04.812
[ Tchaikovsky's
"Sleeping Beauty Waltz" plays ]

21:07.760 --> 21:09.342
What the hell?

21:09.390 --> 21:11.518
You're under arrest.

21:11.560 --> 21:13.221
Oh.
What?

21:13.270 --> 21:14.226
I--

21:14.270 --> 21:15.806
There must be
some mistake.

21:19.020 --> 21:20.602
Man: You have the right
to remain silent.

21:20.650 --> 21:22.027
Anything you say can and will
be used against you

21:22.070 --> 21:23.026
in a court of law.

21:31.580 --> 21:32.900
How could you do this?

21:32.950 --> 21:35.032
I stuck my neck out
to get you that job,

21:35.080 --> 21:36.662
and this is
how you repay me?

21:36.710 --> 21:37.996
Okay, Stella,
I think you're blowing it

21:38.040 --> 21:39.496
a little bit
out of proportion.

21:39.540 --> 21:41.417
Blowing it out of
proportion? Stella.

21:41.460 --> 21:43.508
Aiden, you broke the law.
Barely.

21:43.550 --> 21:45.291
They prescribe those pills
to kids.

21:45.340 --> 21:46.922
Every college student
has them.

21:46.970 --> 21:49.348
All T did was sell some
to some responsible adults

21:49.390 --> 21:51.097
that actually needed them.

21:51.140 --> 21:52.460
Do you have any idea what
those soccer moms go through?

21:52.520 --> 21:53.726
It's terrible.

21:53.770 --> 21:54.760
You know what?

21:54.810 --> 21:56.517
I'm done with you.

22:00.610 --> 22:02.021
It's kind of hard
to be done with me

22:02.070 --> 22:03.276
when we're both stuck
in here.

22:03.320 --> 22:05.482
Stella Abbott.

22:07.950 --> 22:09.190
Free to go.

22:09.240 --> 22:10.480
Thank you.

22:17.420 --> 22:18.956
Hey, wh

22:19.000 --> 22:21.583
<i>The witnesses said
she had nothing to do with I,</i>

22:21.630 --> 22:23.667
but they all rolled on you.

22:23.710 --> 22:25.337
So you stay.

22:25.380 --> 22:26.506
Wait.
I can't just leave him.

22:26.550 --> 22:28.370
Not really up to you.

22:29.590 --> 22:32.343
Aiden, I'm gonna get you
out of here.

22:32.390 --> 22:34.301
I thought
you're done with me?

22:34.350 --> 22:36.307
I am.

22:36.350 --> 22:37.727
But we're still family.

22:44.780 --> 22:46.680
Hey, Ida.

22:46.740 --> 22:47.810
Oh, hey, Diego.

22:47.860 --> 22:49.066
How do you
like these folded --

22:49.110 --> 22:52.114
squares or triangles?

22:52.160 --> 22:54.197
Mom, just put down
his underpants, please.

22:56.040 --> 22:58.247
We need to talk to you
about something.

22:59.710 --> 23:01.121
You take it.
What?

23:01.170 --> 23:03.832
Uh, wow. Um...

23:03.880 --> 23:05.041
Okay.

23:05.090 --> 23:06.626
Well, first, uh,

23:06.670 --> 23:08.081
we just want to say how much --

23:08.130 --> 23:09.541
how much we appreciate,

23:09.590 --> 23:12.252
uh, what you've done
for us and the kids

23:12.300 --> 23:13.756
while Lizzie was gone.

23:13.810 --> 23:15.050
Oh, please.

23:15.100 --> 23:17.011
If anyone should be thankful,
it's me.

23:17.060 --> 23:18.471
And with a breakup,

23:18.520 --> 23:20.727
it is so nice
to feel wanted.

23:21.900 --> 23:25.643
Um, and we are happy

23:25.690 --> 23:28.068
that you're happy.

23:29.240 --> 23:31.026
But...

23:31.070 --> 23:33.198
the truth is,

23:33.240 --> 23:34.822
what we really need
is actually to --

23:34.870 --> 23:35.940
Oh, no, no, no, no.

23:35.990 --> 23:38.448
No, I-I know
what you need, honey.

23:38.500 --> 23:39.740
You two are so busy --

23:39.790 --> 23:41.827
barely enough time
for each other,

23:41.870 --> 23:42.996
let alone the kids.

23:43.040 --> 23:44.622
You need me to do more,

23:44.670 --> 23:45.876
and I'm happy to.

23:45.920 --> 23:47.661
I got it!

23:49.800 --> 23:51.177
I could stay here
forever.

23:53.590 --> 23:55.843
Wes: Do you guys know
where Stella is?

23:55.890 --> 23:57.176
She didn't come home

23:57.220 --> 23:58.710
after her shift
at the coffee shop,

23:58.770 --> 24:00.977
Dr. Chang says she didn't
show up at the hospital,

24:01.020 --> 24:02.647
and now she's not
answering her phone.

24:02.690 --> 24:04.010
Where is she?

24:04.060 --> 24:05.437
Wes, the last time
I talked to Stella,

24:05.480 --> 24:06.720
she was fine.

24:09.570 --> 24:10.856
Stella: Wes.

24:10.900 --> 24:11.947
Stella, where are you?

24:11.990 --> 24:13.867
Sorry I disappeared.

24:13.910 --> 24:16.698
Aiden and I
ran into some trouble.

24:16.740 --> 24:17.866
What kind of trouble?

24:17.910 --> 24:19.651
Um,
we kind of got arrested.

24:19.700 --> 24:22.112
Arrested

24:22.170 --> 24:24.457
For selling his ADD meds.

24:24.500 --> 24:25.661
I-I've been cleared
of all charges,

24:25.710 --> 24:26.836
but Aiden's
still being held.

24:26.880 --> 24:27.790
I'm at my dad's office
right now

24:27.840 --> 24:29.160
to see if he can help.

24:29.210 --> 24:30.507
Okay.

24:30.550 --> 24:32.712
Um, meet me at Lizzie's.

24:32.760 --> 24:34.637
Okay. See you there later. Yeah.

24:41.430 --> 24:42.807
Aiden's been arrested.

24:42.850 --> 24:43.976
I know.

24:44.020 --> 24:45.806
He called me from jail.

24:45.860 --> 24:47.646
I cannot believe
that he did this.

24:47.690 --> 24:49.522
Me neither.
Once you bail him out,

24:49.570 --> 24:51.186
we've got to sit him down
with the whole family,

24:51.240 --> 24:53.390
and -- and we've got to talk
some sense into him.

24:53.450 --> 24:56.738
Stella,
I'm not bailing him out.

25:05.290 --> 25:07.281
He's your son.
You have to bail him out.

25:07.340 --> 25:08.660
Your brother needs to face

25:08.710 --> 25:10.667
the consequences
of his actions.

25:10.710 --> 25:12.792
It's the only way
he'll ever learn.

25:12.840 --> 25:14.330
I can't believe
you're being so cold.

25:14.380 --> 25:16.587
Oh, he's gonna be okay.

25:16.640 --> 25:18.847
I spoke to a law-professor
friend of mine.

25:18.890 --> 25:20.767
She says,
as a first-time offender,

25:20.810 --> 25:22.801
he'll get
community service.

25:22.850 --> 25:23.976
In the meantime,

25:24.020 --> 25:25.590
it's one or two nights
in jail.

25:25.650 --> 25:27.220
So that's it?

25:27.270 --> 25:28.556
You do nothing?

25:28.610 --> 25:29.816
You just wash your hands
of this whole thing?

25:29.860 --> 25:31.601
This isn't
me washing my hands.

25:31.650 --> 25:32.981
This is me out of options.

25:33.030 --> 25:35.351
If he'd kept his word
and done his job,

25:35.400 --> 25:37.402
he wouldn't be
in this position.

25:37.450 --> 25:39.077
I want him
to turn his life around

25:39.120 --> 25:40.576
just as much as you do
but --

25:40.620 --> 25:41.906
But nothing.

25:41.950 --> 25:43.156
This isn't your call.

25:43.200 --> 25:45.248
I'm taking this
to the whole family.

25:46.830 --> 25:49.333
Stella: I know that
he went too far this time.

25:49.380 --> 25:51.291
But I also know

25:51.340 --> 25:53.411
that he's never gonna change
without our help.

25:53.460 --> 25:54.962
Peter:
We have tried to help him

25:55.010 --> 25:57.172
more times
than I could count.

25:57.220 --> 25:59.882
Lizzie, you remember the time
you lent him your car

25:59.930 --> 26:01.807
while he was still
in college?

26:01.850 --> 26:03.978
I loved that car,
and he totaled it

26:04.020 --> 26:05.476
doing donuts in front
of a sorority house.

26:05.520 --> 26:07.306
Diego,
remember the time

26:07.350 --> 26:08.897
he slept
with your boss's wife?

26:08.940 --> 26:10.510
To be fair,

26:10.560 --> 26:12.392
I mean, she did
come on pretty strong.

26:12.440 --> 26:13.851
And, Stella,
how 'bout the time

26:13.900 --> 26:15.277
you cashed in
your savings bonds for him?

26:15.320 --> 26:17.106
He used that money
to go see a therapist.

26:17.150 --> 26:19.778
He used it to buy
Minecraft upgrades.

26:19.820 --> 26:21.447
All right. I get it.

26:21.490 --> 26:24.289
No. I don't think you do.

26:28.000 --> 26:29.991
Our son is a drug dealer.

26:30.040 --> 26:32.372
We've given him
too many chances,

26:32.420 --> 26:34.297
too many
"get out of jail free" cards.

26:34.340 --> 26:36.126
If we don't draw
this line in the sand,

26:36.170 --> 26:37.797
I'm afraid
he's never gonna learn.

26:39.220 --> 26:42.008
Mom, please,
don't let him do this.

26:42.050 --> 26:43.961
I'm sorry, Stell,

26:44.020 --> 26:45.670
but I agree
with your father.

26:45.730 --> 26:48.939
I know I haven't said this
much lately, Peter,

26:48.980 --> 26:50.470
but I think you're right.

26:53.980 --> 26:56.233
I think it's time
for a little tough love.

26:56.280 --> 26:57.145
Wes.

26:58.240 --> 27:00.356
Will you talk
some sense into them?

27:02.830 --> 27:04.696
Wes?

27:04.740 --> 27:07.118
Actually, Stella,

27:07.160 --> 27:09.458
if I'm being honest,

27:09.500 --> 27:10.990
I agree with your family.

27:15.340 --> 27:20.369
You gave me strength
when I felt weak

27:20.430 --> 27:24.719
You got me out
when I dove too deep

27:24.760 --> 27:26.216
"The world is yours"
you said

27:26.270 --> 27:27.760
Hey.

27:27.810 --> 27:29.687
Hey.

27:29.730 --> 27:31.346
Where's Mom and Dad?

27:31.400 --> 27:34.062
I love you so,
I love you so

27:34.110 --> 27:35.930
I love you so
Dad says that

27:35.980 --> 27:37.732
you're on your own
this time.

27:37.780 --> 27:41.819
Wow, that is just great.

27:41.860 --> 27:43.817
I can't believe
I actually thought

27:43.870 --> 27:46.111
things might be different
between us now,

27:46.160 --> 27:48.492
but I guess people
never change.

27:48.540 --> 27:50.781
Kind of ironic coming from
a guy sitting in jail

27:50.830 --> 27:52.878
who promised me
he'd turn his life around.

27:52.920 --> 27:54.331
Now you sound like Dad.

27:54.380 --> 27:55.415
Good.

27:57.630 --> 28:00.088
Because he's really worried
about you.

28:00.130 --> 28:01.256
We all are.

28:01.300 --> 28:03.257
Aiden, this is serious.

28:03.300 --> 28:05.041
You think
I don't know that?

28:05.100 --> 28:06.499
Well, it's hard to tell
sometimes.

28:06.560 --> 28:07.880
Everything
is a joke to you.

28:07.930 --> 28:09.762
You have no idea
what you're talking about,

28:09.810 --> 28:11.630
because you have no idea
who I really am.

28:11.690 --> 28:13.931
Then tell me.
What's the point?

28:13.980 --> 28:15.857
Everyone decided
I was a screw-up

28:15.900 --> 28:17.686
a long time ago.

28:17.730 --> 28:19.528
I'm done trying to prove
everyone wrong.

28:19.570 --> 28:21.607
Prove us wrong?

28:21.650 --> 28:23.903
How is selling drugs
proving us wrong?

28:23.950 --> 28:25.770
How is wrecking
Lizzie's car

28:25.830 --> 28:27.821
to impress a bunch of
sorority girls proving us wrong?

28:27.870 --> 28:29.827
And how was
getting me arrested --

28:29.870 --> 28:31.861
how was that
proving us wrong?

28:31.910 --> 28:34.322
Arms as strong
as the wind

28:34.380 --> 28:35.666
The truth is

28:35.710 --> 28:37.872
all you've ever cared about
is yourself,

28:37.920 --> 28:39.627
Dressed ready to Kill

28:39.670 --> 28:41.468
Stella, why do you think
I got those stupid pills

28:41.510 --> 28:43.421
in the first place?

28:43.470 --> 28:47.293
Head in the clouds
but feet on the ground

28:47.350 --> 28:49.057
With you

28:49.100 --> 28:52.479
It's all safe and sound

28:52.520 --> 28:54.056
Hush, hush, baby
Registrar's office says that,

28:54.100 --> 28:56.478
if you don't get your grades up
by the end of semester,

28:56.520 --> 28:57.817
they're pulling
your work-study.

28:57.860 --> 29:00.101
They can't do that.

29:00.150 --> 29:01.561
I need this job.

29:01.610 --> 29:02.896
Well,
if you need this job so bad,

29:02.950 --> 29:04.315
then maybe you should --
I don't know --

29:04.360 --> 29:05.566
start doing it?

29:05.610 --> 29:08.113
And nobody
will break you

29:08.160 --> 29:10.652
Whoa.
Where'd you get those?

29:10.700 --> 29:14.534
My doc wrote me a prescription
a couple weeks ago.

29:14.580 --> 29:15.741
Ever since
Stella got sick,

29:15.790 --> 29:18.999
I've been having trouble
focusing.

29:19.040 --> 29:20.917
A smile filled with life

29:20.960 --> 29:22.416
Between school, work,

29:22.470 --> 29:24.006
driving back and forth
to see her,

29:24.050 --> 29:26.542
I'm exhausted.

29:26.590 --> 29:29.673
Last week, I fell asleep
driving my sister's car

29:29.720 --> 29:31.427
and totaled it.

29:31.470 --> 29:33.222
Dude,
I'm glad you're okay.

29:33.270 --> 29:36.262
Hush, hush, baby

29:36.310 --> 29:37.857
And nobody will break you

29:37.900 --> 29:42.394
I'm sorry to just
unload on you, but...

29:42.440 --> 29:45.694
it's so hard
to be here doing this

29:45.740 --> 29:48.903
when my whole body
feels like

29:48.950 --> 29:50.770
I should be there
with her.

29:50.830 --> 29:52.696
Mm, mm-mm, mm-mm

29:52.750 --> 29:55.788
I mean, what if --

29:55.830 --> 29:57.787
What if I'm not there.

29:59.540 --> 30:01.918
You know, if you want to
spend more time with your sister,

30:01.960 --> 30:05.965
then maybe
you don't need this job.

30:06.010 --> 30:08.638
You can make a lot more money
selling those things.

30:10.600 --> 30:12.386
Stella: That's why you
started selling drugs?

30:14.680 --> 30:15.841
Why didn't you
tell Mom and Dad

30:15.890 --> 30:17.187
the truth
about Lizzie's car?

30:17.230 --> 30:19.141
Because they had enough
to worry about.

30:19.190 --> 30:21.261
I didn't want them
to worry about me.

30:21.320 --> 30:25.735
So this is my fault...

30:25.780 --> 30:27.020
again.

30:27.070 --> 30:29.448
That's not
what I'm saying.

30:29.490 --> 30:30.946
I'm not blaming you.

30:30.990 --> 30:33.539
I'm trying to get you
to understand me.

30:33.580 --> 30:35.571
I didn't mean
to become this guy,

30:35.620 --> 30:38.419
and I wasn't trying
to take the easy way out.

30:38.460 --> 30:39.950
I was trying
to make it all work,

30:40.000 --> 30:41.661
and it just happened.

30:47.510 --> 30:52.095
I don't want to be this guy
anymore, Stella.

30:52.140 --> 30:53.756
But I don't know
what to do.

30:56.850 --> 30:59.649
Aiden,
it's gonna be okay.

30:59.690 --> 31:01.852
If they won't get you
out of here, I will.

31:01.900 --> 31:04.278
Where are you gonna
get the money?

31:04.320 --> 31:06.061
I'll figure it out.

31:06.110 --> 31:08.272
I promise.

31:08.320 --> 31:10.527
Elizabeth: Hey.

31:10.570 --> 31:12.447
Hey. How you doin'?

31:12.490 --> 31:15.573
Oh, I'm fine.

31:15.620 --> 31:18.032
My mom,
on the other hand...

31:18.080 --> 31:21.710
um, between the breakup
and everything with Aiden,

31:21.750 --> 31:22.956
she's not doing great.

31:26.210 --> 31:28.042
I just don't think
this is the time to tell her

31:28.090 --> 31:29.421
we're not happy
having her here.

31:31.180 --> 31:32.329
Right.

31:32.390 --> 31:33.425
We'll make it work.

31:33.470 --> 31:34.676
Yeah.

31:34.720 --> 31:38.133
Sure, we'll have to suffer
a little bit.

31:38.180 --> 31:41.434
That's what you do
for family.

31:46.730 --> 31:47.856
Diego: Love you.

31:50.990 --> 31:53.368
Oh, man, I've wanted one of
these fancy European scooters

31:53.410 --> 31:54.650
since I was old enough
to drive!

31:54.700 --> 31:56.577
Thank you!
Ride it in good health.

32:04.340 --> 32:05.705
What's got Nurse Gretchen
so excited?

32:08.010 --> 32:09.796
Nurse Gretchen: Whee!

32:09.840 --> 32:11.831
Eat, pray, love, bitches!

32:11.880 --> 32:13.006
Did you sell
your scooter?

32:14.090 --> 32:15.922
Why?
I thought you loved that thing.

32:15.970 --> 32:18.428
Mm.
I love my brother more.

32:18.470 --> 32:21.633
I needed the money
to bail him out of jail.

32:21.690 --> 32:24.352
He got arrested
for selling drugs,

32:24.400 --> 32:26.858
and no one in my family
will help bail him out.

32:26.900 --> 32:28.777
I mean,
what is wrong with him?

32:28.820 --> 32:31.027
And when did they become a
chorus to a bad country song?

32:32.820 --> 32:34.367
Nothing's wrong with him.

32:34.410 --> 32:36.026
This is what happens
to families

32:36.080 --> 32:37.696
when someone gets cancer.

32:37.740 --> 32:38.901
With my brother,

32:38.950 --> 32:40.327
same thing happened
to my family.

32:40.370 --> 32:41.952
You know, my parents
never filled the void

32:42.000 --> 32:44.537
that Jesse left.

32:44.580 --> 32:46.491
Look, Stella,
you have to realize that

32:46.540 --> 32:48.702
when you got sick,
so did they.

32:48.750 --> 32:51.754
What happened to them,
what they went through --

32:51.800 --> 32:54.258
Think about the fear
that they had of losing you.

32:54.300 --> 32:56.678
You know, it just --
it doesn't go away overnight.

32:59.180 --> 33:00.966
I got to go get
my brother...

33:01.020 --> 33:02.476
Hey,
you just sold your scooter.

33:02.520 --> 33:04.397
Let me give you a ride.
No, no, I'll take a cab.

33:04.440 --> 33:05.896
I'm driving right
by there. It's fine.

33:05.940 --> 33:07.601
I can take care of myself,

33:07.650 --> 33:09.641
I know you can.

33:09.690 --> 33:11.237
I'm not trying
to take care of you.

33:11.280 --> 33:13.146
I'm just
trying to give you a ride.

33:13.200 --> 33:14.270
Well, you can't.

33:18.870 --> 33:21.862
You have to stop
offering me rides

33:21.910 --> 33:25.244
and...amazing advice

33:25.290 --> 33:26.451
and making me feel like

33:26.500 --> 33:27.877
you're the only person
on Earth

33:27.920 --> 33:30.491
who really gets me.

33:30.550 --> 33:32.587
I didn't...

33:32.630 --> 33:34.086
I didn't know
I was doing that.

33:34.130 --> 33:36.588
Well, you are.

33:36.640 --> 33:38.597
And it's really
got to stop.

33:38.640 --> 33:40.677
Because I'm married
to an incredible man

33:40.720 --> 33:42.427
who I love
with all of my heart,

33:42.470 --> 33:45.269
and it...
really sucks to know

33:45.310 --> 33:46.937
that no matter
how hard he tries,

33:46.980 --> 33:49.563
he might never understand
what I'm going through

33:49.610 --> 33:50.725
the way that you do.

34:03.410 --> 34:05.401
Well,
this is worse than jail.

34:11.630 --> 34:19.630
[ Billy Raffoul's
"Dark Four Door" plays ]

34:20.850 --> 34:23.467
You got up

34:23.520 --> 34:25.386
You felt you should

34:28.850 --> 34:30.806
I keep trying
to tell myself

34:30.860 --> 34:33.351
I woulda done the same
had I could

34:33.400 --> 34:35.687
Thank you
for bailing out Aiden.

34:35.739 --> 34:38.812
Well, I wanted you to know
I got your back.

34:38.860 --> 34:40.065
Because we're married.

34:40.120 --> 34:41.610
I never thought
that you would

34:41.659 --> 34:42.946
Not that you'd know it
from what I just heard.

34:42.989 --> 34:44.150
Wes.

34:44.199 --> 34:45.860
It's not like that.
Really?

34:45.909 --> 34:47.650
Because it sounded like

34:47.710 --> 34:48.949
you were telling
another man

34:49.000 --> 34:50.741
that he's the only one

34:50.790 --> 34:52.621
that really
understands you.

34:52.670 --> 34:55.002
I'm sorry.

34:55.050 --> 34:57.542
I-I wasn't trying
'to hurt you.

34:57.590 --> 35:00.332
So long
as you come back home

35:00.390 --> 35:01.880
So I went south
to define me

35:01.930 --> 35:04.718
So, is Dr. Handsome

35:04.770 --> 35:07.478
the reason you've been
acting so weird?

35:07.520 --> 35:10.399
Until then I'm still
looking for you

35:10.440 --> 35:11.646
Yes.

35:11.690 --> 35:12.725
In every dark
four door

35:12.770 --> 35:14.147
Do you have feelings
for him?

35:14.190 --> 35:17.820
I have a connection
with him.

35:17.860 --> 35:21.023
But it's nothing like
the one that I have with you.

35:21.070 --> 35:23.198
I'm in love with you.

35:23.240 --> 35:24.651
You are the love of my life,

35:24.700 --> 35:28.910
and -- and he's just a friend...
who gets me.

35:28.960 --> 35:31.452
I don't sleep enough
at night

35:31.500 --> 35:37.371
Wes, you're my husband
and my soul mate.

35:37.420 --> 35:38.797
And he's a great guy,

35:38.840 --> 35:40.467
but he'll never make me feel
the way that you do.

35:40.510 --> 35:43.138
You sure about that?
Yes.

35:43.180 --> 35:44.966
I want to be with you.

35:45.010 --> 35:46.387
I choose you.

35:46.430 --> 35:47.591
As long as
you come back home

35:47.640 --> 35:49.130
And I choose us.
I always will.

35:49.180 --> 35:51.729
So I went south
to define me

35:51.770 --> 35:53.226
And someday
you'll find me

35:53.270 --> 35:55.102
Please say something.

35:55.150 --> 35:57.642
What do you want me
to say?

35:57.690 --> 35:59.101
The truth.

35:59.150 --> 36:00.697
Until then I'm still
looking for you

36:00.740 --> 36:02.276
In every dark four door

36:02.320 --> 36:05.119
The truth is...

36:05.160 --> 36:06.821
Until then
I'm still looking for you

36:06.870 --> 36:08.747
...]I don't choose you,
Stella.

36:08.790 --> 36:10.861
In every dark four door

36:10.910 --> 36:13.629
The way I feel about you
is not a choice for me

36:13.670 --> 36:16.913
any more than it is
a choice to breathe.

36:16.960 --> 36:19.964
So knowing that
I'm a choice to you,

36:20.010 --> 36:21.876
one of many options,
it's -- it...

36:23.300 --> 36:25.098
Honestly, there aren't words
to describe

36:25.140 --> 36:26.676
how that makes me feel.

36:26.720 --> 36:29.212
Until then I'm still
looking for you

36:29.270 --> 36:31.762
In every dark four door

36:31.810 --> 36:33.642
I need some time
to think.

36:33.690 --> 36:35.351
Wes,
that's not what I meant.

36:35.400 --> 36:37.266
Until then I'm still
looking for you

36:37.320 --> 36:40.483
In every dark four door

36:43.530 --> 36:44.861
Mom.

36:44.910 --> 36:46.116
Ida: Hmm?

36:46.160 --> 36:47.275
What's all this?

36:47.330 --> 36:48.820
Nothing.

36:48.870 --> 36:50.076
I just ordered delivery

36:50.120 --> 36:51.952
from that Moroccan place
you like.

36:52.000 --> 36:53.911
I thought you could use
a little date night --

36:53.960 --> 36:55.780
the two of you.

36:55.830 --> 36:57.662
And the kids
are all tucked in.

36:59.670 --> 37:01.798
You didn't have
to do that.

37:01.840 --> 37:03.717
Yes, I did.

37:03.760 --> 37:07.298
You guys have been so sweet
to have me here.

37:07.350 --> 37:08.749
But I've been
a little tone-deaf.

37:08.810 --> 37:11.131
So from now on,

37:11.180 --> 37:13.262
I will be
as quiet as a mouse.

37:13.310 --> 37:14.892
You won't even know
I'm here.

37:14.940 --> 37:17.557
You heard us talking,
didn't you?

37:17.610 --> 37:18.566
Every word.

37:18.610 --> 37:20.317
But you were right.

37:20.360 --> 37:22.237
I didn't mean to be such
an imposition.

37:22.280 --> 37:27.946
It's just
without Poppy or your father...

37:27.990 --> 37:30.288
I don't really have anyone
to talk to.

37:31.750 --> 37:33.616
Well, that's not true.

37:33.660 --> 37:36.960
Okay, you --
you have us.

37:37.000 --> 37:39.742
And this is
where you belong.

37:39.800 --> 37:41.336
Oh, honey,
no, it's not.

37:41.380 --> 37:44.008
Yes, it is.

37:44.050 --> 37:46.212
You're my mother.

37:46.260 --> 37:48.297
And you're staying,
okay?

37:48.350 --> 37:50.637
We insist.
Yeah.

37:50.680 --> 37:52.591
Are you sure?
Yes!

37:52.640 --> 37:54.847
Come on,
who's gonna spoil our kids

37:54.890 --> 37:57.052
and move our stuff
to ridiculous places?

37:58.270 --> 38:00.102
The -- The spice cabinet
makes sense.

38:00.150 --> 38:01.561
I stand by that, guys.

38:01.610 --> 38:07.026
Uh, what do you say
that tonight

38:07.070 --> 38:10.370
we all have dinner
together?

38:10.410 --> 38:13.368
I'd really like that.

38:13.410 --> 38:14.650
Oh, guess what,

38:14.710 --> 38:16.246
the lamb meatballs
are to die for!

38:16.290 --> 38:19.328
- You are
going to love them!

38:21.000 --> 38:23.503
When it comes
to the people you love most,

38:23.550 --> 38:25.166
you have to be there
for them,

38:25.220 --> 38:26.540
even when it's hard.

38:26.590 --> 38:28.752
Taunted by that
new daylight

38:28.800 --> 38:30.711
Aiden.

38:30.760 --> 38:32.421
When you just can't sleep
before the morn

38:32.470 --> 38:34.552
Peter: How'd you get out
of jail? Wes bailed me out.

38:34.600 --> 38:38.264
<i>Nice to know someone
still gives a damn about me.</i>

38:38.310 --> 38:41.473
I do give a damn
about you.

38:41.520 --> 38:43.773
You think
this is easy for me?

38:43.820 --> 38:45.356
Seems pretty easy.

38:45.400 --> 38:46.856
Well, it's not.

38:46.900 --> 38:49.278
You ain't nobody's
little girl

38:49.320 --> 38:51.368
Son.

38:51.410 --> 38:52.650
You ain't nobody's
sacred son

38:52.700 --> 38:54.156
I'm sorry.

38:54.200 --> 38:55.998
But I'm worried about you.

38:56.040 --> 38:58.998
You can't keep going down
the path you're on.

38:59.040 --> 39:00.417
You needed a wake-up call,

39:00.460 --> 39:02.030
and I thought
a few nights in jail

39:02.090 --> 39:03.205
might be exactly that.

39:03.250 --> 39:04.797
It's not that simple,
Dad.

39:04.840 --> 39:07.548
I'll be comin' home

39:07.590 --> 39:09.888
So you don't
have to be alone

39:09.930 --> 39:11.295
Remember that time

39:11.340 --> 39:13.058
I went backpacking
up North?

39:13.100 --> 39:17.389
I kind of got arrested

39:17.430 --> 39:19.182
for "borrowing" an ATV
from a campsite.

39:19.230 --> 39:21.016
Well, I'm ragged, too,
just like you

39:21.060 --> 39:23.142
Suspended sentence.

39:23.190 --> 39:26.023
I...paid a fine,

39:26.070 --> 39:33.079
but apparently the conviction
is still on my record.

39:33.120 --> 39:38.286
Feelin' like
a little child

39:38.330 --> 39:44.793
Aiden, I'm so sorry.

39:44.840 --> 39:46.205
I didn't know.

39:46.250 --> 39:47.911
It gets worse.

39:47.960 --> 39:53.342
Those pills I was selling --
Schedule II drug.

39:53.390 --> 39:56.963
Same as cocaine,

39:57.020 --> 39:58.135
which means...

39:58.180 --> 39:59.807
You're facing
a felony charge.

39:59.850 --> 40:01.386
Lately,
I've been thinkin' of

40:01.440 --> 40:03.511
Yeah.

40:03.560 --> 40:04.971
All the losing
that I've done in love

40:05.020 --> 40:07.102
What am I gonna do, Dad?

40:07.150 --> 40:09.858
I don't know, son.

40:09.900 --> 40:14.360
The wind,
she steals my sweet caress

40:14.410 --> 40:16.196
- Please feel me
IN your emptiness

40:16.240 --> 40:18.322
You have to keep trying,

40:18.370 --> 40:19.952
even when things
are at their worst.

40:20.000 --> 40:23.072
Wait up for me

40:24.840 --> 40:28.049
Wait up for me

40:28.090 --> 40:29.546
I'll be comin' home

40:29.590 --> 40:31.627
Are we gonna be okay?

40:31.680 --> 40:35.799
So you don't
have to be alone

40:35.850 --> 40:37.466
If I'm being honest...

40:37.510 --> 40:41.140
Wait up for me

40:41.180 --> 40:42.341
...] don't know.

40:42.390 --> 40:45.439
Wait up for me

40:45.480 --> 40:47.972
I'll be comin' home

40:48.020 --> 40:50.068
Because the minute
you stop trying,

40:50.110 --> 40:53.603
that's when you know
you're in real trouble.
