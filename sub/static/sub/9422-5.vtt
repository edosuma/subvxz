if you'd put together

03:40.020 --> 03:42.956
a short list for candidates
for your chief of staff.

03:43.023 --> 03:46.026
Not yet. I've been kinda busy
hunting down the woman I love,

03:46.093 --> 03:48.061
since you drove her away.

03:48.128 --> 03:51.932
Not me. Carmelita left
of her own volition.

03:51.999 --> 03:54.968
She would've found out
how Ellen died eventually.

03:55.035 --> 03:57.004
You would've told her.

So it's better
to let her go now.

Dad, I don't want
to argue with you today.

04:03.043 --> 04:05.012
One heart attack
per month, right?

04:05.078 --> 04:07.981

04:08.048 --> 04:10.017

Add to that whatever shares
he's acquired

Hostage?

09:44.051 --> 09:45.018
That's what you call staying

09:45.085 --> 09:47.020
at the largest private residence
in Manhattan

09:47.087 --> 09:50.023
with a staff that waits on you
hand and foot?

09:50.090 --> 09:52.025
I wasn't talking
about the staff.
(Mutters indistinctly)

09:52.092 --> 09:53.994
How is everybody?
We're peachy.

09:54.061 --> 09:56.964
How's my son?
It might just be the flu,

09:57.030 --> 09:59.032
but I am concerned,
given the fact that Brian Jr.

09:59.099 --> 10:01.034
Has spent the last six months
in Brazil,

10:01.101 --> 10:03.036
that he may have picked up
a parasite.

10:03.103 --> 10:05.038
See? There's another
hidden benefit

10:05.105 --> 10:07.975
of life
in the Southern hemisphere.
As a matter of fact,

10:08.041 --> 10:09.977
since the two of you
have spent time down there,

10:10.043 --> 10:12.946
I'd like to check you both
as well.
Absolutely.
Whatever you need.

10:13.013 --> 10:16.116
Good. I'll send my nurse up
to collect some stool samples.

10:19.119 --> 10:22.055
Boy, life with you
just keeps getting better.

10:22.122 --> 10:24.057
First you move my son
to South America,

10:24.124 --> 10:27.995
and now you've got me
pooping in a cup.

10:29.997 --> 10:30.998
Kudos.

10:31.064 --> 10:33.033
(Knock on door)
(Man) You busy?

10:33.100 --> 10:35.969
No.
Just doing the trial prep

10:36.036 --> 10:37.037
on Letitia Darling's
murder case

10:37.104 --> 10:39.039
in between cleaning up
all the messes you left behind

10:39.106 --> 10:41.041
when you got promoted
above me.

10:41.108 --> 10:43.944
Never too busy for you, sir.

10:44.011 --> 10:47.014
Does the name chase Alexander
mean anything to you?

10:47.080 --> 10:48.949
No. Should it?

10:49.016 --> 10:51.051
He's the brother
of Ellen Darling.
Patrick Darling's wife,

10:51.118 --> 10:53.954
the one who got burned up
in their family's country house.

10:54.021 --> 10:56.957
What about him?
He gave a statement
to one of our deputies.

10:57.024 --> 10:59.993
He, um, seems to think that
the Darlings killed Ellen,

11:00.060 --> 11:02.963
dumped her there,
and then torched the place

11:03.030 --> 11:06.033
to make it seem like
an accident.
Not exactly beyond
the realm of possibilities,

11:06.099 --> 11:08.936
given the Darlings.
Agreed.

11:09.002 --> 11:12.039
We tried to follow up
with chase, but suddenly he's--
gone.

11:12.105 --> 11:13.974
Right.
Huh.

11:14.041 --> 11:16.944
Dutch George, Ellen Darling
and now this Alexander guy...

11:17.010 --> 11:19.046
You think
there's a connection.
I think,

11:19.112 --> 11:22.950
from where I sit in my plush
corner office down the hall,

11:23.016 --> 11:25.085
that it's your job
to find out.

11:29.089 --> 11:30.991
(Door opens and closes)

11:31.058 --> 11:33.961
(The virgins)
♪ we're best friends ♪

11:34.027 --> 11:35.996
♪ we hold hands ♪

11:36.063 --> 11:37.064
♪ we're in love ♪

11:37.130 --> 11:40.067
(Reporters all shouting at once)

11:40.133 --> 11:44.004
(Camera shutters clicking)

11:44.071 --> 11:48.008
♪ And is there something
that you love about her? No ♪

11:48.075 --> 11:50.978
♪ and if she's playing
hard to get, I'm out the door ♪

11:51.044 --> 11:53.981
Do I really look that sad?

11:54.047 --> 11:56.049
Kinda, yeah.

11:56.116 --> 11:58.051
Nick George.
Joel madden.

11:58.118 --> 12:00.053
So you, uh,
you know the artist?

12:00.120 --> 12:02.956
Nah, the gallery owner
asked me to pose.

12:03.023 --> 12:05.926
Thought it might help
make a splash or something.

12:05.993 --> 12:07.961
I owed him
some poker money, so...
Him?

12:08.028 --> 12:09.997
Yeah.
Who owns this gallery?

12:10.063 --> 12:12.966
Jeremy Darling.

12:13.033 --> 12:14.968
Guess he's running late.

12:15.035 --> 12:16.937
Excuse me for a second.

12:17.004 --> 12:19.940
(Lisa) I-I don't want to
pigeonhole the work we show.

12:20.007 --> 12:21.975
Painting or photography,
I'm just looking for

12:22.042 --> 12:24.044
the freshest artists
we can find.
Uh-huh.

12:24.111 --> 12:26.046
Excuse me. Thank you.
Of course.

12:26.113 --> 12:27.047
Hi.

12:27.114 --> 12:28.982
Isn't this amazing?

12:29.049 --> 12:31.985
Amazing. And it's too bad
your partner isn't here

12:32.052 --> 12:34.988
to enjoy all the attention.

12:35.055 --> 12:38.058
What partner?
I know that you didn't get
this place on your own.

12:38.125 --> 12:40.961
I know you lied to me about--
I know all about Jeremy.

12:41.028 --> 12:43.030
Nick, I couldn't have gotten it
without him cosigning--

12:43.096 --> 12:47.034
save it for the art critic.
I'm outta here.

13:08.055 --> 13:09.022
Nick...

13:09.089 --> 13:10.958
Nick.

13:11.024 --> 13:12.960
What?

13:13.026 --> 13:16.029
Are we gonna talk
about this?
Talk about what?

13:16.096 --> 13:19.032
The gallery.
Well, we did
talk about it, Lisa.

13:19.099 --> 13:22.002
I said no.
You did it anyway.

13:22.069 --> 13:25.005
So obviously talking about it
doesn't help.

13:25.072 --> 13:26.940
(Voice breaking) Nick.

13:27.007 --> 13:28.976
Nick!

13:29.042 --> 13:30.043
(Sighs)

13:30.110 --> 13:32.045
(Door slams)

13:39.052 --> 13:42.022
Okay, so listen, it would
really mean a lot to me

13:42.089 --> 13:44.992
if you guys could come
to my party tomorrow night,

13:45.058 --> 13:47.961
especially given the fact that
my fiancé this time

13:48.028 --> 13:49.930
is so much more...

13:49.997 --> 13:51.999
Black.
Controversial.

13:52.065 --> 13:54.968
Karen, I would love to come,
really, but I've made some--
wait, wait, wait.

13:55.035 --> 13:57.971
I thought you were gonna
start standing up to daddy.
I am.

13:58.038 --> 13:59.973
I just turned down
his top two choices

14:00.040 --> 14:02.009
for my chief of staff.

14:02.075 --> 14:04.978
You know, one battleground
at a time, please.

14:05.045 --> 14:07.047
Patrick, you of all people
should know what it's like

14:07.114 --> 14:10.050
to be in love with someone
that daddy disapproves of.

14:10.117 --> 14:12.052
Well, yes, Karen, but he also

14:12.119 --> 14:15.989
didn't choose to fall in love
with daddy's mortal enemy.

14:16.056 --> 14:18.025
Look, I never ask you guys
for anything, ever.

14:18.091 --> 14:21.028
I'm asking you now.
Please.

14:22.129 --> 14:24.932
Oh, come on.

14:24.998 --> 14:27.034
Please, Jeremy.

14:27.100 --> 14:30.938
Well... love's
a wild beast, man.

14:31.004 --> 14:33.974
You can't tame it.
You can't control it.

14:34.041 --> 14:36.043
No one knows this
more than me.

14:38.011 --> 14:40.047
I'm in.
(Karen gasps)

14:40.113 --> 14:42.049
Thank you.

14:42.115 --> 14:45.986
Uh, I'm guessing Tripp's
gonna die long before you.

14:46.053 --> 14:49.056
Might as well play
the long game. I'm in.

14:49.122 --> 14:51.959
Okay. Patrick?

14:52.025 --> 14:53.994
(Chuckles)

14:54.061 --> 14:56.029
All right. I'll be there.

14:56.096 --> 14:58.932
Really?
But nobody tells dad.

14:58.999 --> 15:00.067
Are you kidding?
Of course not.

15:00.133 --> 15:02.102
(Patrick) Right?
(Brian) Not a chance.

15:06.039 --> 15:08.041
Mr. senator-elect.

15:08.108 --> 15:09.042
Congratulations.

15:09.109 --> 15:11.044
I'd love to chat, Ms. lyons,

15:11.111 --> 15:14.014
but I'm in the process of
assembling a transition team.

15:14.081 --> 15:17.985
Yes, I read about your
short list for chief of staff.

15:18.051 --> 15:20.988
Geriatric, but meeting
daddy's approval, I'm sure.

15:21.054 --> 15:23.056
(Chuckles) Ms. lyons,
I'm not sure what brings you

15:23.123 --> 15:26.994
or your winning personality
to the state office,

15:27.060 --> 15:28.996
but I've already told you

15:29.062 --> 15:30.964
everything I know
about my mother's case

15:31.031 --> 15:33.967
in my deposition.
Well, I'm not here to talk about
the murder of Dutch George.

15:34.034 --> 15:36.003
I'm here
to talk about the night

15:36.069 --> 15:38.038
your family's country home
burned down,

15:38.105 --> 15:40.974
the night your wife died.

15:41.041 --> 15:42.976
Plane crashes, fires--

15:43.043 --> 15:44.978
ratio of fun family dinners
to suspicious deaths

15:45.045 --> 15:47.981
runs pretty high in your family,
don't you think?

15:48.048 --> 15:50.951
We are not the luckiest crew,
that's for sure.

15:51.018 --> 15:53.053
What can you tell me
about chase Alexander?

15:53.120 --> 15:56.056
I can tell you that he's
my dear, dead wife's brother,

15:56.123 --> 15:59.026
and that this little impromptu
inquisition of yours is over.

15:59.092 --> 16:01.962
Do you know where I might
be able to find him?
No idea.

16:02.029 --> 16:05.065
He's kind of run off.
Perhaps you should
follow his lead.

16:11.004 --> 16:12.940
Thank you for your time.

16:13.006 --> 16:14.942
(Man) Round one...
(Bell dings)

16:15.008 --> 16:16.043
Fight!
Eat it, dad!

16:16.109 --> 16:17.978
Like the taste of leather?

16:18.045 --> 16:19.980
Why don't you save
that trash talk

16:20.047 --> 16:21.982
for somebody who can't
spank you

16:22.049 --> 16:23.951
with the hand of impunity?
(Knock on door)

16:24.017 --> 16:25.018
Ms. Andrea is back.

16:25.085 --> 16:27.087
Okay, quick,
hit the sheets.

16:31.024 --> 16:34.061
Look how beautiful this is.
Look at the beauty.

16:34.127 --> 16:37.030
And I marinate the asparagus,
and I brush this...

16:37.097 --> 16:39.032
What's going on in here?

16:39.099 --> 16:41.034
Nothing.

16:41.101 --> 16:44.938
Just, uh... (Exhales)
Watching the boob tube.

16:45.005 --> 16:46.940
Look at this.
Now were gonna...

16:47.007 --> 16:50.010
Brian...
He's covered in sweat.

16:50.077 --> 16:53.046
Oh, well, maybe his fever
is breaking.

16:53.113 --> 16:55.949
I'm okay.
(Cell phone rings)

16:56.016 --> 16:56.950
(Ring)

16:57.017 --> 16:58.018
(Beeps)

16:58.085 --> 17:00.020
Hey, Dr. little,
what's up?

17:00.087 --> 17:03.023
No, it's...

17:03.090 --> 17:05.992
Uh-huh.
As soon as possible? Yeah.

17:06.059 --> 17:08.929
Okay, thanks.

17:08.996 --> 17:09.997
(Man speaking indistinctly)

17:10.063 --> 17:12.031
What did the doctor say?
Nothing.

17:12.098 --> 17:15.035
He just wants us to go down
to his office downtown.

17:15.102 --> 17:17.037
Well,
your son will be thrilled

17:17.104 --> 17:20.007
to finally
get out of the house.

17:20.073 --> 17:22.009
No, he said not to bring
the dwarf.

17:22.075 --> 17:25.012
He just wants to see
the two of us.

17:32.019 --> 17:35.022
(Revs engine)

17:35.088 --> 17:37.991
(Turns engine off)

17:38.058 --> 17:39.927
Hey, Nick.

17:39.993 --> 17:40.994
Nice ride.

17:41.061 --> 17:43.997
Yep. It's one-of-a-kind,
just arrived from Napoli.

17:44.064 --> 17:48.001
Designed by Gianni depp.

17:48.068 --> 17:49.970
No relation.

17:50.037 --> 17:52.973
What the hell?!
So I guess putting
my fist in your face

17:53.040 --> 17:55.976
didn't get the message across.
It did! I swear! What--
what was the message again?

17:56.043 --> 17:57.978
To stay away from my wife.

17:58.045 --> 18:00.981
I am! I did! I...
Get your hands off me.

18:01.048 --> 18:03.951
You don't have to go
all jet li on me.

18:04.017 --> 18:06.954
Jeremy, I asked you
to steer clear of Lisa,

18:07.020 --> 18:10.023
now I find out you're
bankrolling her gallery.
I'm just helping her out
as a friend.

18:10.090 --> 18:12.993
Yeah.
It's true, Nick. I am in love
with... someone, but not Lisa.

18:13.060 --> 18:15.028
Yeah? Then with who?
No one you know.

18:15.095 --> 18:16.997
You sure?
'Cause I think I do.
Easy, miss Cleo.

18:17.064 --> 18:18.999
Nola lyons.

18:19.066 --> 18:20.934
Who's that?

18:21.001 --> 18:23.003
Come on.
You're seeing nola lyons.

18:23.070 --> 18:25.038
What if I am?
Oh, so it's the truth?

18:25.105 --> 18:27.040
No.
Just tell me. Is it?

18:27.107 --> 18:30.010
I don't know.
Jeremy, I need you to admit
that you are having

18:30.077 --> 18:32.012
a sexual relationship
with the woman

18:32.079 --> 18:35.015
who is prosecuting
your mother for murder.

18:35.082 --> 18:37.985
Oh!
Own up to it, Jeremy!
Come on!

18:38.051 --> 18:41.021
Or I'm gonna kick your ass
up and down park Avenue.

18:41.088 --> 18:43.957
Your mother could go to jail
for the rest of her life!

18:44.024 --> 18:45.959
Okay! Okay.
I'm having a thing with nola.

18:46.026 --> 18:47.027
But...
But you don't understand.

18:47.094 --> 18:49.029
But it doesn't matter
what I understand.

18:49.096 --> 18:51.999
What matters is that you'll
swear to it in court.

18:52.065 --> 18:54.101
You suck, Nick.

18:57.004 --> 18:59.106
Okay. Okay, I'll do it.

19:01.074 --> 19:04.978
Smart choice...
For a change.

19:20.994 --> 19:24.031
What's this?
It's a sworn affidavit
from Jeremy Darling

19:24.097 --> 19:26.967
attesting to his
extremely active, highly unusual

19:27.034 --> 19:29.036
sexual relationship
with Ms. lyons.

19:29.102 --> 19:30.971
Your honor, I'd like--

19:31.038 --> 19:34.041
Ms. lyons, thank you.

19:37.010 --> 19:38.946
My God,
this reads like something

19:39.012 --> 19:41.949
out of "penthouse forum."

19:42.015 --> 19:44.051
Or how I imagine
that would read.

19:44.117 --> 19:46.053
We move for
an immediate dismissal

19:46.119 --> 19:47.988
of all charges.

19:48.055 --> 19:49.990
When a prosecutor's misconduct
rises to the level

19:50.057 --> 19:53.026
where it shocks
the conscience--
yes, I'm familiar
with the penal code.

19:53.093 --> 19:56.029
Ms. lyons, is this true?
Are you having

19:56.096 --> 19:58.999
a sexual relationship
with the son of the defendant?

19:59.066 --> 20:02.002
Your honor, my personal life has
nothing to do with this case.

20:02.069 --> 20:04.004
Well, if these allegations
are true, it does.

20:04.071 --> 20:06.974
So I'll ask you again,
and if you don't respond,

20:07.040 --> 20:10.944
you'll be held
in contempt of court.

20:11.011 --> 20:13.046
We've been seeing each other.

20:13.113 --> 20:14.982
Excuse me?
Yes.

20:15.048 --> 20:18.952
I'm sorry. I can't hear you.
Yes, I'm sleeping
with Jeremy Darling,

20:19.019 --> 20:20.954
the defendant's son.

20:21.021 --> 20:21.989
Happy?

20:22.055 --> 20:25.025
Happy doesn't quite
do it justice somehow, but...

20:25.092 --> 20:27.027
Well, then,
I'm sorry to say this,

20:27.094 --> 20:29.963
but all charges
against Letitia Darling

20:30.030 --> 20:31.999
are hereby dismissed.
Dismissed?

20:32.065 --> 20:34.935
Got a hearing problem?
Yes, completely.

20:35.002 --> 20:37.037
With this degree
of prosecutorial misconduct,

20:37.104 --> 20:39.940
I don't see any other way.
So this is it?

20:40.007 --> 20:42.042
A rich woman in a fit of pique
deposits her lover on the bottom

20:42.109 --> 20:45.012
of the long island sound,
and she walks?

20:45.078 --> 20:47.948
Is it really that easy to
get away with murder? I me--

20:48.015 --> 20:50.951
Ms. lyons, if this case is on
a fast train out of town,

20:51.018 --> 20:52.953
it's because you bought it
a first-class ticket.

20:53.020 --> 20:55.055
Don't you dare
get self-righteous with me.

20:55.122 --> 20:57.057
My apologies.

20:57.124 --> 20:59.026
Good day, your honor.

20:59.092 --> 21:01.995
Ms. lyons, hang back.

21:02.062 --> 21:04.064
We're not done.

21:14.007 --> 21:16.009
You're not bringing a gift?

21:16.076 --> 21:18.946
My presence is my present.

21:19.012 --> 21:20.948
Karen's lucky
she's getting that.

21:21.014 --> 21:22.015
What's in the box?

21:22.082 --> 21:23.984
His-and-her
defibrillator paddles.

21:24.051 --> 21:25.052
What for?

21:25.118 --> 21:26.987
The honeymoon.

21:27.054 --> 21:29.990
Bro, if you have to ask,
you don't want to know.

21:30.057 --> 21:32.025
Jeremy, Brian.

21:32.092 --> 21:35.028
You going out?

21:35.095 --> 21:36.997
No. Yeah.

21:37.064 --> 21:41.034
We... were...
Just going out. Yeah.

21:41.101 --> 21:43.971
Oh. Uh, your--
your mother and I were hoping

21:44.037 --> 21:47.007
I could persuade you
to play a round of bridge.

21:47.074 --> 21:49.943
(Chuckles)
Bridge. Maximum.

21:50.010 --> 21:52.980
I would so dig that in...
But--

21:53.046 --> 21:55.983
Levine's conducting tannhauser
at the met tonight.

21:56.049 --> 21:57.951
Right, and we promised

21:58.018 --> 22:02.089
that we'd meet both of them
after for... nachos.

22:07.027 --> 22:09.997
What's in the box?

22:10.063 --> 22:12.032
A puppy.

22:12.099 --> 22:13.967
Gotta run, dad.

22:14.034 --> 22:16.036
The little fella's
on the clock.

22:16.103 --> 22:19.006
(Clatters)

22:20.040 --> 22:22.042
(Under breath)
We're so friggin' dead.

22:30.117 --> 22:32.119
(Door opens)

22:36.056 --> 22:37.057
Mm.

22:37.124 --> 22:40.961
Scotch.

22:41.028 --> 22:43.030
Someone's unhappy.

22:43.096 --> 22:45.032
Did you speak
with Jeremy and Brian

22:45.098 --> 22:47.000
about attending Karen's fete?

22:47.067 --> 22:49.937
Oh, we didn't discuss it,
but if they'd asked,

22:50.003 --> 22:51.004
I'd have encouraged it.

22:51.071 --> 22:52.039
Really?

22:52.105 --> 22:54.975
I'd be there myself
if the state of New York

22:55.042 --> 22:57.945
didn't have me penned inside
their invisible fence.

22:58.011 --> 23:00.080
Huh. (Sighs)

23:03.016 --> 23:04.051
She's not your little girl.

23:04.117 --> 23:08.021
Tripp, she's grown-up.
Let her go.

23:08.088 --> 23:11.024
Let them all go.

23:20.033 --> 23:22.035
(Door closes)

23:26.073 --> 23:28.008
(Patrick)
When we were little,

23:28.075 --> 23:29.943
Karen had this rule

23:30.010 --> 23:31.979
that she could hit me
whenever she wanted to,

23:32.045 --> 23:34.014
and I was never allowed
to hit her back.

23:34.081 --> 23:36.016
Little did she know
she would be preparing me

23:36.083 --> 23:37.985
for a life in politics.

23:38.051 --> 23:41.021
(All laugh)

23:41.088 --> 23:44.024
Seriously...
I love you, tipsy.

23:44.091 --> 23:46.960
And, Simon,
you take care of her.

23:47.027 --> 23:48.996
She's a real pistol,
that one.

23:49.062 --> 23:52.065
And, Karen... let's just
all hope this one sticks.

23:52.132 --> 23:54.034
Oh, hear, hear.

23:54.101 --> 23:56.003
(Cheers and whistles)

23:56.069 --> 23:57.971
Thank you, Patrick...
(Clears throat)

23:58.038 --> 24:01.008
And Brian, Jeremy.

24:01.074 --> 24:03.977
It was brave of you three
to come here tonight

24:04.044 --> 24:06.046
despite the fear,
and let's face it,

24:06.113 --> 24:08.982
the very real possibility
of paternal retribution.

24:09.049 --> 24:11.985
You'll never know how much
we both appreciate it.

24:12.052 --> 24:15.956
It is a testimony
to your love for Karen

24:16.023 --> 24:18.926
and to your openness
as human beings.

24:18.992 --> 24:19.993
Thank you.

24:20.060 --> 24:22.930
You know, if you read
the business section,

24:22.996 --> 24:24.932
you might--you might think
this pending marriage

24:24.998 --> 24:27.034
is some sort
of corporate merger.

24:27.100 --> 24:28.969
But it's not.

24:29.036 --> 24:30.003
No.

24:30.070 --> 24:32.005
Far from it.

24:32.072 --> 24:36.043
Karen and I are...
Setting off to, uh,

24:36.109 --> 24:39.947
hopefully with all of you
by our sides,

24:40.013 --> 24:41.949
to form
a new kind of family--

24:42.015 --> 24:43.984
one that operates
without intimidation

24:44.051 --> 24:45.986
and authoritarian control,

24:46.053 --> 24:48.989
a-a family that supports
each other

24:49.056 --> 24:50.991
without coercion.

24:51.058 --> 24:55.028
Just imagine a family
with no secrets,

24:55.095 --> 24:57.998
no loyalty tests,

24:58.065 --> 25:00.033
no... no traditions,

25:00.100 --> 25:03.971
just freedom, mutuality...

25:04.037 --> 25:07.040
And respect.

25:09.009 --> 25:10.944
Well, I know we're ready.

25:11.011 --> 25:12.946
Mm.

25:13.013 --> 25:16.016
And we hope you are, too.

25:16.083 --> 25:19.052
Good evening.

25:22.089 --> 25:26.960
(Guests murmuring)

25:27.027 --> 25:31.064
It's fine.
I'm expecting this.

25:38.005 --> 25:39.106
Karen...

25:41.041 --> 25:43.944
I know why you're doing
what you're doing.

25:44.011 --> 25:46.013
And I hope you understand,

25:46.079 --> 25:48.949
if not today, then someday,

25:49.016 --> 25:51.051
why I did what I did.

25:54.021 --> 25:55.989
It was just money.

25:56.056 --> 25:59.026
And when it comes to that,
I'm sure that you will be

25:59.092 --> 26:02.029
well taken care of
in this place.

26:02.095 --> 26:04.031
But please know

26:04.097 --> 26:07.067
that when it comes
to what really matters,

26:07.134 --> 26:10.037
I would never, ever...

26:10.103 --> 26:12.072
Do anything to hurt you.

26:16.043 --> 26:18.979
You're my little girl...

26:19.046 --> 26:21.114
And you always will be.

26:23.083 --> 26:26.019
Thank you, daddy.

26:28.055 --> 26:31.024
As for you three...

26:32.993 --> 26:39.066
Clearly you felt the need
to sneak around behind my back.

26:39.132 --> 26:44.037
That was unfortunate.

26:48.108 --> 26:52.946
(Guests murmuring)

26:53.013 --> 26:55.949
Patrick. Patrick.

26:56.016 --> 26:58.051
Patrick.

27:00.120 --> 27:03.957
(Whispers) Sorry, sis.

27:04.024 --> 27:05.993
(Groans)

27:06.059 --> 27:08.061
(Singsong voice)
Brian.

27:08.128 --> 27:10.964
Hey, thanks for the punch.

27:11.031 --> 27:14.034
(Normal voice) No.

27:14.101 --> 27:17.037
Jeremy, it's--
you can stay.

27:17.104 --> 27:19.940
Peace out.

27:20.007 --> 27:23.010
(Murmuring continues)

27:29.082 --> 27:31.985
I'm sorry.

27:32.052 --> 27:36.023
Me, too.

27:41.028 --> 27:43.964
(Murmuring continues)

28:10.023 --> 28:11.959
(Simon) Whew.

28:12.025 --> 28:15.028
The party is over.

28:15.095 --> 28:16.997
I'll say.

28:17.064 --> 28:19.967
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

28:20.033 --> 28:21.969
Are you having
second thoughts?

28:22.035 --> 28:23.971
No.

28:24.037 --> 28:27.007
I got through those
a couple hundred thoughts ago.

28:27.074 --> 28:30.043
Listen, honey,
if you want to go home

28:30.110 --> 28:32.045
and beg your father
to take you back,

28:32.112 --> 28:36.016
if you think this is all
a huge mistake,

28:36.083 --> 28:37.985
it's okay, go.
No.

28:38.051 --> 28:40.988
No, no, no, I mean it.
I want you to be happy.

28:41.054 --> 28:43.924
That's all I have wanted
ever since we met,

28:43.991 --> 28:46.093
for you to be happy.

28:48.028 --> 28:50.030
Well, I want
to be happy, too,

28:50.097 --> 28:54.935
but, um... right now,
it just seems impossible.

28:55.002 --> 28:57.004
Hey, hey.

28:57.070 --> 28:57.971
What?

28:58.038 --> 29:00.974
Look at me. It's okay.

29:01.041 --> 29:05.045
Hey. Karen,
you grab on to me.

29:05.112 --> 29:07.948
I'm here.

29:08.015 --> 29:11.985
And we will be alone...

29:12.052 --> 29:14.087
Together.

29:22.062 --> 29:24.965
Hey.

29:25.032 --> 29:26.967
I got your message.

29:27.034 --> 29:30.003
Isn't this a little, uh...

29:30.070 --> 29:32.940
What?
Out-in-public like?

29:33.006 --> 29:34.942
You know, I thought
we were supposed to be

29:35.008 --> 29:36.009
keeping ourselves
on the d-low.

29:36.076 --> 29:39.012
No, it's over.
What is?

29:39.079 --> 29:41.949
New York vs. Letitia Darling
for one thing.

29:42.015 --> 29:44.952
You haven't heard?
Your mother's a free woman.
Since when?

29:45.018 --> 29:46.954
Since the judge
threw out the case

29:47.020 --> 29:49.957
on account of
prosecutorial misconduct.

29:50.023 --> 29:51.959
Congratulations.
You told Nick about us.
I had to.

29:52.025 --> 29:53.994
After I begged you,
I asked you, I told you

29:54.061 --> 29:56.997
that it was gonna be--
I didn't think it would upset
the whole friggin' apple cart.

29:57.064 --> 30:00.033
Okay, I'm sorry.
It was a moment of weakness.
A moment? A-a moment.
Okay, yeah. Try a lifetime.

30:00.100 --> 30:03.937
Wait. It can't end like this.
No, you know what?
You're right. You're right.

30:04.004 --> 30:06.006
It gets worse, because I still
have to appear

30:06.073 --> 30:08.008
before the New York bar
ethics committee

30:08.075 --> 30:10.043
and sit there and squirm
while they decide

30:10.110 --> 30:12.980
whether or not
to have me disbarred.

30:13.046 --> 30:16.049
Okay, 20 years, everything that
I've worked for? Worthless.

30:16.116 --> 30:19.052
My perfect conviction record?
Smoke.
I didn't have a choice.

30:19.119 --> 30:21.922
No! No!
Don't kid yourself.

30:21.989 --> 30:23.991
You had a choice...

30:24.057 --> 30:26.059
But you don't have one now.

30:45.078 --> 30:48.949
Andrea, Brian.
How's Brian Jr. this morning?

30:49.016 --> 30:50.017
Yeah, he's great.

30:50.083 --> 30:51.952
The, uh, herbal compresses

30:52.019 --> 30:53.954
and jungle twig tea
are really doing the trick.

30:54.021 --> 30:55.956
He does
actually seem better.

30:56.023 --> 30:58.926
Good, good.
Glad to hear it.

30:58.992 --> 31:01.995
Let's all take a seat.

31:02.062 --> 31:04.932
And how are you both
doing today?

31:04.998 --> 31:06.967
Fine.
Is our son okay?

31:07.034 --> 31:09.036
Except for his flu, yes.
Brian Jr. is fine.

31:09.102 --> 31:12.039
His labs came back
completely normal.

31:15.108 --> 31:18.045
Is there something else?

31:18.111 --> 31:22.049
As we discussed, I also ran
both of your bloods,

31:22.115 --> 31:26.019
and, uh, I have some
difficult news.

31:26.086 --> 31:28.956
What's wrong?

31:29.022 --> 31:32.025
Andrea...
You have cancer.

31:34.094 --> 31:36.096
I know.

31:39.099 --> 31:43.971
I... I was diagnosed
a year and a half ago,

31:44.037 --> 31:45.973
and my doctor said

31:46.039 --> 31:48.008
that if I started
chemotherapy that day...

31:48.075 --> 31:51.011
(Chuckles)
If I took his poison,

31:51.078 --> 31:57.985
that I'd have a 1-in-3 shot
of making it 5 years.

31:58.051 --> 32:01.021
I couldn't live with
those odds.

32:01.088 --> 32:04.024
(Voice breaking)
I needed more--more choices

32:04.091 --> 32:06.960
and more time.

32:07.027 --> 32:10.030
Wait a minute. That's why
you went to Brazil?

32:10.097 --> 32:11.965
(Whispers) Yeah.

32:12.032 --> 32:14.968
(Normal voice) After six months
of holistic treatment there,

32:15.035 --> 32:17.037
my cancer went into remission.

32:17.104 --> 32:22.042
And I've been disease-free
for over a year now.

32:24.111 --> 32:27.047
(Voice breaks) Till today.

32:29.983 --> 32:32.953
So, um, what are you
gonna do now?

32:33.020 --> 32:36.023
Brian Jr. and I are gonna
fly back to S O Paulo,

32:36.089 --> 32:37.958
and I'm gonna
restart treatments.

32:38.025 --> 32:40.027
Sure, why not? I mean,
they seemed to work wonders.

32:40.093 --> 32:43.931
Brian, I know that you don't
want Brian Jr. to leave--
Andrea, this is about you.

32:43.997 --> 32:46.033
Okay?
Don't be a moron.

32:46.099 --> 32:48.969
The twigs and tea won't work.

32:49.036 --> 32:53.006
So would you just stay here
and let me take care of you?

33:03.016 --> 33:06.019
We need to spend
some time apart.

33:06.086 --> 33:08.021
I can't be with you
right now.

33:08.088 --> 33:10.023
Nick...
Lisa, you lied to me.

33:10.090 --> 33:12.025
You lied to me
about kissing Jeremy,

33:12.092 --> 33:14.962
and then you lied to me
about the gallery.

33:15.028 --> 33:18.031
I was going to tell you
about that. I was.
But you didn't.

33:18.098 --> 33:21.935
And I can't be married
to somebody who lies to me.

33:22.002 --> 33:24.004
(Chuckles) I get enough
of that from the Darlings.

33:24.071 --> 33:27.007
I thought we were trying
to make things work.

33:27.074 --> 33:29.009
Well, I thought
we were, too.

33:29.076 --> 33:31.044
(Sighs) I did.

33:31.111 --> 33:33.013
But they're not.

33:33.080 --> 33:35.983

But you're happy about it.

37:04.091 --> 37:07.928
No. You're a brilliant lawyer,
a force of nature, almost.

37:07.995 --> 37:09.997
I can't say I always agree
with your tactics

37:10.063 --> 37:11.932
or your choice of targets,

37:11.999 --> 37:14.034
but you've been a real credit
to the Manhattan office.

37:14.101 --> 37:16.069
Good luck.

37:18.071 --> 37:19.940
(Sighs)

37:20.007 --> 37:22.976
And you're still here.

37:23.043 --> 37:24.978
I was just wondering...

37:25.045 --> 37:28.949
How goes the search
for your chief of staff?

37:29.016 --> 37:30.984
We've got a few names.

37:31.051 --> 37:32.986
Any of them younger
than the woolworth building

37:33.053 --> 37:35.022
or not in
Tripp Darling's pocket?

37:35.088 --> 37:37.024
Why do you ask?

37:37.090 --> 37:40.961
Because you're gonna need
protection.

37:41.028 --> 37:44.031
A freshman senator is in
a very exposed position.

37:44.097 --> 37:49.002
I mean, somebody could dig up
all kinds of stuff.

37:49.069 --> 37:53.006
Say, for example, that there's
a local police department

37:53.073 --> 37:55.008
covering up
a possible arson case

37:55.075 --> 37:57.945
in the senator's family home.

37:58.011 --> 38:00.047
Say there's a woman,
a woman of mystery,

38:00.113 --> 38:03.050
as in it's a mystery whether
she's a man or a woman,

38:03.116 --> 38:05.986
and she could have
something to do

38:06.053 --> 38:08.989
with the senator's wife's
untimely demise.
Would you get to the point?

38:09.056 --> 38:10.991
I want the job.

38:11.058 --> 38:13.994
You want to be
my chief of staff?

38:14.061 --> 38:15.963
Yes.

38:16.029 --> 38:17.965
You maliciously prosecute
my mother

38:18.031 --> 38:20.000
for a crime she didn't commit,

38:20.067 --> 38:22.002
indulge in an inappropriate
relationship with my brother,

38:22.069 --> 38:25.005
and then you waltz in here,
and you basically blackmail me.

38:25.072 --> 38:28.008
Why the hell would I ever want
to make you my chief of staff?

38:28.075 --> 38:31.011
Because you're gonna be so busy
fighting for your political life

38:31.078 --> 38:32.980
once you get to Washington,

38:33.046 --> 38:35.983
that you're gonna need
more than a chief of staff.

38:36.049 --> 38:38.018
You're gonna need
an attack dog.

38:38.085 --> 38:41.021
I'd be good for you,
and you know it.

39:00.040 --> 39:01.975

39:02.042 --> 39:04.011

What are you doing here?

39:04.077 --> 39:06.013
Don't marry Simon.
It's a mistake.

39:06.079 --> 39:08.015
Look, you did your job,
smart guy.

39:08.081 --> 39:11.919
You saved the company.
I don't care about the company.

39:11.985 --> 39:14.087
At least,
it's not my first concern.

39:17.991 --> 39:20.027
Well, then what is?

39:20.093 --> 39:22.963
You.

39:23.030 --> 39:25.032
And me.

39:25.098 --> 39:27.000
Did something happen
with Lisa?

39:27.067 --> 39:29.036
I don't know.

39:29.102 --> 39:31.972
(Sighs) Yes.

39:32.039 --> 39:34.041
Nick, don't do this to me.

39:34.107 --> 39:37.945
Karen--
don't do this to me. I moved on.
I made--I made plans.

39:38.011 --> 39:40.047
Your plans, if they include
marrying a guy who wants you

39:40.113 --> 39:43.016
just so he can take over your
family's company, are insane.

39:43.083 --> 39:46.053
I'm sorry. You can't just
show up here whenever you want

39:46.119 --> 39:48.021
and screw with my head, Nick.

39:48.088 --> 39:51.925
I know. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, okay? I just...

39:51.992 --> 39:55.028
I don't want to see you
make a huge mistake.
Then step up.

39:57.998 --> 39:59.032
What do you mean?

39:59.099 --> 40:03.036
Don't ask me... to give up
everything for nothing.

40:03.103 --> 40:05.005
Don't ask me to derail my life

40:05.072 --> 40:07.975
if you're not gonna
derail yours,

40:08.041 --> 40:09.977
because I can't leave Simon
for an abstraction, Nick.

40:10.043 --> 40:13.080
(Voice breaks) I can only--
I can only leave him for you.

40:16.016 --> 40:18.986
(Sighs)

40:19.052 --> 40:22.089
What's it gonna be?

40:33.033 --> 40:36.036
(Electronic beeping)

40:38.071 --> 40:40.040
(Computer chirps)

40:45.078 --> 40:50.017
I gave you a very simple task

40:50.083 --> 40:52.953
and a chance--a promise--

40:53.020 --> 40:55.022
to be a part
of something remarkable,

40:55.088 --> 40:58.959
and now, thanks to you,
to your lack of control,

40:59.026 --> 41:01.962
the project has been crippled.

41:02.029 --> 41:04.998
I'm sorry.
I made a mistake.

41:05.065 --> 41:08.001
But it wasn't all a waste.

41:08.068 --> 41:10.003
The case is over!

41:10.070 --> 41:12.005
And we both know
that the evidence

41:12.072 --> 41:14.975
didn't point to her.

41:15.042 --> 41:19.046
Our case was crumbling anyway.
I found another way in.

41:19.112 --> 41:21.048
I'm listening.

41:21.114 --> 41:24.051
I've been invited
to go to Washington

41:24.117 --> 41:26.053
with a certain
freshman senator.

41:26.119 --> 41:30.111
Say hello to Patrick Darling's
chief of staff.
