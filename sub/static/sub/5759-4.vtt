WEBVTT

00:01.130 --> 00:04.122
PREVIOUSLY ON
PRETI'Y LI'ITLE LIARS...
THE RV-- IT'S GONE!

00:04.700 --> 00:07.362
( choking, whimpering )

00:07.470 --> 00:09.335
( coughing )

00:09.440 --> 00:11.260
( all scream )

00:11.370 --> 00:14.009
Paige: EM, ARE YOU GONNA
BE ABLE TO SWIM?

00:16.450 --> 00:18.441
I'M JAKE.
DO YOU TEACH PRIVATELY?

00:18.550 --> 00:20.472
WHEN WOULD YOU LIKE TO START?
TODAY.

00:23.250 --> 00:24.444
I MOVED THE RV.

00:24.550 --> 00:26.552
"A" ASKED FOR IT IN EXCHANGE
FOR THE TRANSCRIPT

00:26.660 --> 00:28.480
FROM MY MOTHER'S DOCTOR
AT RADLEY

00:28.590 --> 00:29.750
WRITTEN ON THE NIGHT
SHE KILLED HERSELF.

00:31.260 --> 00:32.750
HEY, MOM.

00:32.860 --> 00:35.397
HI, HONEY.
THIS IS ZACK.

00:35.500 --> 00:37.559
MY PARTNER AND I ARE
INVESTIGATING THE MURDERS

00:37.670 --> 00:39.490
OF OFFICER REYNOLDS
AND DETECTIVE WILDEN.

00:39.600 --> 00:42.137
Hanna: WERE YOU IN NEW YORK
THE WHOLE TIME YOU WERE GONE?

00:42.240 --> 00:44.105
DID YOU COME BACK TO
HAVE IT OUT WITH WILDEN?

00:44.210 --> 00:46.531
IF YOU'RE ASKING
IF I KILLED HIM,
THE ANSWER IS NO.

00:46.640 --> 00:49.473
Parrot: MISS ME?
GOD, SHE SOUNDS
JUST LIKE ALI.

00:49.580 --> 00:51.445
( parrot whistling tones )
HEY, WHAT'S THIS SONG?

00:51.550 --> 00:53.211
IT'S NOT A SONG--
IT'S A PHONE NUMBER.

00:57.290 --> 01:00.179
OKAY, MY MOM IS NOT
CONNECTED TO A COCKATOO.

01:00.290 --> 01:01.609
PARROT.
WHATEVER.

01:01.720 --> 01:03.426
WELL, THAT BIRD
IS CONNECTED TO ALI,

01:03.530 --> 01:05.122
ALI'S CONNECTED TO WILDEN,
AND WILDEN'S CONNECTED

01:06.460 --> 01:07.620
TO YOUR MOM AND US AND STUFF WE
DON'T EVEN KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT.

01:09.300 --> 01:11.063
MY MOM MAY HAVE HIT HIM
A LITTLE WITH HER CAR,
BUT SHE DID NOT KILL WILDEN.

01:11.170 --> 01:12.728
OF COURSE NOT.

01:12.840 --> 01:14.432
HEY, HOW'S
YOUR SHOULDER?

01:14.540 --> 01:17.429
I'M SEEING THE DOCTOR
AGAIN TOMORROW.

01:17.540 --> 01:19.474
WHY WOULD YOU
TAKE ALL THIS STUFF?
I TOOK THE BIRD STUFF

01:19.580 --> 01:22.674
AND THE REST OF THE JUNK
TO GET PAST MRS. DiLAURENTIS
WITH ALI'S NOTEBOOKS.

01:22.780 --> 01:26.079
WE LEARNED SO MUCH
FROM WHAT ALI WROTE DOWN
IN EM'S BIO BOOK.

01:26.180 --> 01:28.216
WHO KNOWS WHAT COULD BE
WRITTEN IN THESE?

01:29.520 --> 01:31.215
OH....

01:31.320 --> 01:33.379
"EAT, BAKE, LOVE."

01:33.490 --> 01:36.220
Spencer:
THEY LOOK COZY.

01:36.330 --> 01:39.219
YEAH, THEY DO.

01:39.330 --> 01:40.456
HOW'S JAKE?

01:40.560 --> 01:42.221
HE'S NICE.

01:42.330 --> 01:44.821
NO. SERIOUSLY, HE'S NICE.
WE'RE SEEING EACH OTHER TONIGHT.

01:44.930 --> 01:46.534
GREAT.

01:46.640 --> 01:48.460
WELL, YOU DON'T HAVE TO
SAY IT LIKE THAT.

01:48.570 --> 01:50.765
I DIDN'T SAY IT
LIKE ANYTHING.

01:54.280 --> 01:57.306
IS IT WEIRD TO BE JEALOUS
OF YOUR MOM'S LOVE LIFE?

01:57.410 --> 01:58.547
VIENNA?

01:58.650 --> 02:00.572
WELL, OUTSIDE VIENNA.

02:00.680 --> 02:03.683
UM, IN A CASTLE
ON A LAKE.

02:03.790 --> 02:07.317
WOW. PASTRY MUST BE
SERIOUS BUSINESS IN AUSTRIA.

02:07.420 --> 02:09.354
OH, YEAH.

02:09.460 --> 02:11.348
HOW LONG WOULD YOU BE GONE?

02:11.460 --> 02:13.348
LESS THAN A YEAR.

02:14.930 --> 02:19.333
WELL, THAT SOUNDS LIKE
AN INCREDIBLE OPPORTUNITY.

02:19.440 --> 02:21.465
YEAH. IT IS.

02:21.570 --> 02:24.164
THEY ONLY CHOSE
FIVE AMERICANS.

02:24.270 --> 02:27.876
SO...WOULD YOU LIKE
TO COME WITH ME?

02:27.980 --> 02:30.141
WOULD I WHAT?

02:30.250 --> 02:32.718
WOULD YOU LIKE TO
COME WITH ME TO AUSTRIA?

02:32.820 --> 02:36.642
YOU KNOW, READING SHELLEY
BY A LAKE NEXT TO A CASTLE...

02:38.690 --> 02:40.453
I CAN'T.

02:40.560 --> 02:42.289
HMM.

02:42.390 --> 02:43.789
CAN'T. OKAY.

02:43.890 --> 02:45.687
WELL, THAT'S BETTER
THAN "WON'T."

02:45.790 --> 02:47.690
WHY...CAN'T YOU?

02:47.800 --> 02:51.327
WELL, ONE REASON
IS SITTING OVER THERE
WITH HER FRIENDS.

02:53.370 --> 02:55.895
TAKE MOTHERHOOD
OFF THE TABLE
FOR A MINUTE.

02:57.840 --> 03:01.799
WELL, FOR ONE THING,
IT WOULD BE VERY IMPRACTICAL.

03:03.280 --> 03:05.578
THAT'S THE POINT
OF DOING IT.

03:12.860 --> 03:15.351
HEY, EM, COULD YOU
DITCH THIS STUFF SOMEPLACE?

03:15.460 --> 03:17.758
I DON'T WANT MONA TO SEE IT
AND START ASKING US QUESTIONS.

03:17.860 --> 03:19.919
YEAH. I'LL TAKE IT HOME.
WHERE IS MONA?

03:20.030 --> 03:22.590
I DON'T KNOW.
SHE WASN'T AT SCHOOL.

03:22.700 --> 03:26.238
NOT KNOWING WHERE SHE IS
MAKES ME JUST AS NERVOUS
AS WHEN SHE'S ALL OVER US.

03:30.010 --> 03:33.400
YOU GUYS, WHAT'S THIS?
THAT AIN'T NO CUTTLEBONE.

03:33.510 --> 03:36.399
THIS WAS IN ALI'S ROOM?
IT WAS EITHER HERE
OR AT HER GRANDMOTHER'S.

03:36.510 --> 03:38.876
IT DOESN'T REALLY
SEEM HER SPEED.

03:42.620 --> 03:43.814
SPENCE.

03:47.460 --> 03:50.657
WHEN DID SHE GET BACK?
WHY DID SHE COME BACK?

03:50.760 --> 03:53.524
YEAH, I THOUGHT
SHE WAS GONE FOR GOOD
WHEN THEY FOUND WILDEN.

03:53.630 --> 03:56.269
MONA SAID THAT YOUR SISTER
WAS WITH WILDEN ON THE TRAIN,

03:56.370 --> 03:57.621
AND THEN SHE JUST LEAVES
THE NIGHT HE'S KILLED?

03:57.730 --> 03:58.822
MONA SAID SHE WAS
ON THE TRAIN.

03:58.930 --> 04:02.502
JUST BECAUSE MONA SAID IT
DOESN'T MEAN IT'S NOT TRUE.

04:05.410 --> 04:06.536
HOW WAS WASHINGTON?

04:08.510 --> 04:09.909
VERY INTERESTING.

04:10.010 --> 04:11.648
THEY LIKED ME,
I LIKED THEM.

04:11.750 --> 04:13.513
WELL, WHAT'S NOT TO LIKE?

04:13.620 --> 04:15.576
I THINK THEY'RE GONNA
OFFER ME AN INTERNSHIP.

04:15.680 --> 04:17.989
MIGHT BE SAN FRANCISCO,
COULD BE LONDON.

04:18.090 --> 04:20.513
WOW! HOW EXCITING.

04:20.620 --> 04:22.781
I HEAR THINGS
HAVE BEEN EXCITING
AROUND HERE.

04:22.890 --> 04:25.859
WILDEN'S DEAD,
SOMEBODY SHOT HIM
AND STUFFED HIM

04:25.960 --> 04:27.655
IN HIS OWN TRUNK
AND LEFT HIM IN
THE MIDDLE OF TOWN.

04:27.760 --> 04:29.159
BUT, YOU KNOW,
IT'S THE SAME OLD, SAME OLD.

04:29.260 --> 04:33.264
IT'S TERRIBLE.
YOU DON'T KNOW WHO WOULD
WANT TO DO THAT TO HIM, DO YOU?

04:33.370 --> 04:35.497
I HAVE NO CLUE,
AND I'VE BEEN OUT OF TOWN.

04:35.600 --> 04:37.807
YEAH. HAVING AN INTERVIEW
IN WASHINGTON,

04:37.910 --> 04:40.401
AND NOW YOU MIGHT
GO TO SAN FRANCISCO,
MAYBE EVEN LONDON...

04:40.510 --> 04:41.875
CHANCE OF A LIFETIME.

04:41.980 --> 04:44.540
IT'S LIKE THE PERFECT
GETAWAY.

04:46.420 --> 04:50.845
IT MIGHT BE TIME FOR BOTH OF US
TO GET OUT OF THIS LITTLE TOWN--

04:50.950 --> 04:52.815
IF WE KNOW
WHAT'S GOOD FOR US.

05:06.540 --> 05:09.065
* GOT A SECRET,
CAN YOU KEEP IT *

05:09.170 --> 05:11.730
* SWEAR THIS ONE
YOU'LL SAVE *

05:11.840 --> 05:14.035
* BETTER LOCK IT
IN YOUR POCKET *

05:14.140 --> 05:16.802
* TAKING THIS ONE
TO THE GRAVE *

05:16.910 --> 05:21.711
* IF I SHOW YOU THEN I'LL KNOW
YOU WON'T TELL WHAT I SAID *

05:21.820 --> 05:24.311
* 'CAUSE TWO CAN
KEEP A SECRET *

05:24.420 --> 05:26.718
* IF ONE OF THEM IS DEAD *

05:30.730 --> 05:32.595
Hanna:
SO WHERE WAS YOUR DAD?

05:32.700 --> 05:34.327
HE WAS FISHING.

05:34.430 --> 05:36.967
HE WENT OUT ON THIS LAKE
EVERY MORNING,

05:37.070 --> 05:39.868
ACCORDING TO THE GUY
AT THE CAMPGROUND.

05:39.970 --> 05:42.029
I SAT ON THE DOCK
AND WAITED FOR HIM.

05:42.140 --> 05:44.734
I WAITED MOST OF THE DAY,
ACTUALLY.

05:44.840 --> 05:46.728
IT WAS GETTING DARK
WHEN HE CAME BACK IN.

05:46.840 --> 05:48.569
WHAT'D YOU SAY TO HIM?

05:48.680 --> 05:50.500
I TOLD HIM I WAS SORRY.

05:51.910 --> 05:54.708
I TOLD HIM THAT PASTOR TED
FOUND OUT IT WAS SOMEONE
AT THE FOUNDRY

05:54.820 --> 05:55.844
WHO SWITCHED THE BELL.

05:55.950 --> 05:58.441
WHAT DID HE SAY
TO THAT?

05:58.550 --> 06:02.008
HE ASKED ME IF
THAT'S WHY I WAS THERE.

06:02.120 --> 06:03.587
I TOLD HIM NO,

06:03.690 --> 06:05.920
I WAS THERE BECAUSE I...

06:06.030 --> 06:09.659
SHOULD HAVE LISTENED TO HIM,
BACKED HIM UP.

06:09.770 --> 06:11.829
I SHOULD HAVE BELIEVED HIM.

06:13.070 --> 06:16.096
I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING
AFTER THAT. I JUST STOOD THERE.

06:16.200 --> 06:18.703
I WAS GONNA LET HIM
TAKE A SWING AT ME
IF HE WANTED TO.

06:18.810 --> 06:21.028
DID HE?
NO.

06:21.140 --> 06:23.540
HE, UH, TOSSED HIS STRING AT ME

06:23.650 --> 06:26.642
AND ASKED IF I KNEW
HOW TO CLEAN A FISH.

06:26.750 --> 06:30.117
I DO, SO WE, UH,
FRIED UP HIS CATCH
AND HAD DINNER.

06:31.790 --> 06:34.554
WELL, IT SOUNDS LIKE
IT MIGHT BE OKAY.

06:35.820 --> 06:38.527
YEAH. MIGHT BE.

06:50.770 --> 06:53.534
HAN NA.

06:53.640 --> 06:56.404
YOUR MOM DIDN'T DO IT.

06:56.510 --> 06:58.808
WELL, THEN "A's" GONNA MAKE HER
LOOK GUILTIER AND GUILTIER

06:58.910 --> 07:01.515
UNTIL THE COPS
START PAYING ATTENTION.

07:01.620 --> 07:03.144
OKAY, LOOK,
SHOES OR NO SHOES,

07:03.250 --> 07:06.458
WE KNOW SHE WAS IN NEW YORK
THE NIGHT WILDEN DIED.

07:06.560 --> 07:09.654
SO ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS
PROVE SHE WAS IN NEW YORK.

07:09.760 --> 07:11.648
WELL, I DON'T KNOW
IF THAT'S ALL,

07:11.760 --> 07:13.159
BUT IT'S A START.

07:18.570 --> 07:21.767
Aria: VIENNA?
IN AUSTRIA?

07:21.870 --> 07:23.030
THAT'S THE ONE.

07:23.140 --> 07:24.869
WOW.

07:24.970 --> 07:26.676
DON'T SOUND TOO SURPRISED.

07:26.780 --> 07:29.431
I'M NOT SURPRISED,
I'M...IMPRESSED.

07:29.550 --> 07:30.676
THAT'S BETTER.

07:33.880 --> 07:35.677
ARE--ARE YOU GONNA GO?

07:35.780 --> 07:38.180
THERE WAS A SPLIT SECOND
WHERE I THOUGHT ABOUT
BUYING A TICKET

07:38.290 --> 07:39.518
AND GOING WITH HIM.

07:39.620 --> 07:40.985
ONLY A SECOND?

07:41.090 --> 07:43.854
YOU'D BE SURPRISED
HOW LONG A SECOND CAN LAST.

07:47.260 --> 07:49.626
WELL, DO YOU WANT TO GO?

07:49.730 --> 07:52.164
IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE.

07:54.240 --> 07:57.129
I JUST ASKED IF
YOU WANTED TO GO.

07:57.240 --> 07:59.731
ARE YOU WORRIED OF
WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF YOU'RE
AWAY FROM HIM FOR A YEAR?

07:59.840 --> 08:01.808
LESS THAN A YEAR.

08:01.910 --> 08:05.505
STILL, IT'S...
IT'S A LONG TIME TO
BE AWAY FROM SOMEONE.

08:05.610 --> 08:07.146
YES.

08:07.250 --> 08:09.639
YES, IT IS.

08:16.830 --> 08:19.151
Spencer: STRIKE THREE.

08:19.260 --> 08:22.969
ARE YOU SURE
WHAT YOU GOT FROM THE BIRD
WAS A REAL PHONE NUMBER?

08:23.070 --> 08:24.890
IT WOULDN'T RING IF IT WASN'T
A REAL PHONE NUMBER.

08:25.000 --> 08:27.491
IT'S JUST NOT IN ANY
REVERSE DIRECTORY I CAN FIND.

08:40.650 --> 08:42.140
ARE YOU OKAY?

08:42.250 --> 08:45.185
I JUST KEEP READING
DR. PALMER'S NOTES.

08:45.290 --> 08:48.214
I WANTED TO KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED TO MY MOM.

08:50.260 --> 08:52.251
IT'S JUST NOT IN THERE.

08:58.170 --> 09:00.661
THEY'RE GONNA FIND OUT
WHAT YOU DID.

09:00.770 --> 09:03.898
WITH THE LAIR.
EMILY AND THE OTHERS.

09:04.010 --> 09:05.864
I KNOW.

09:07.210 --> 09:10.748
WE SHOULD TELL THEM
BEFORE THEY FIND OUT
FROM SOMEBODY ELSE.

09:10.850 --> 09:13.216
I DON'T THINK I COULD
LOOK THEM IN THE EYE.

09:15.720 --> 09:18.939
THE THING ABOUT "A,"
WHEN IT WAS MONA...

09:19.050 --> 09:22.554
WHATEVER IT IS NOW...

09:22.660 --> 09:25.049
SHE ALWAYS KNOWS WHEN
YOU'RE AT YOUR WEAKEST.

09:25.160 --> 09:26.889
"SHE"?

09:27.000 --> 09:30.060
IT'S ALWAYS FELT LIKE A SHE,
HASN'T IT?

09:38.170 --> 09:40.707
"CHECK THE FACTS."
THAT'S WHAT "A" TOLD YOU, RIGHT?

09:44.210 --> 09:47.043
UNLOCKED A WINDOW AT RADLEY,
AND JUMPED.

09:48.750 --> 09:50.980
THOSE ARE THE FACTS,
BUT HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED
TO CHECK THEM?

09:53.860 --> 09:55.259
YOU'D GO BACK THERE?

09:55.360 --> 09:57.988
IF I THOUGHT IT WOULD HELP.

10:08.940 --> 10:11.829
WHAT IS IT?
WHAT'S WHAT?

10:11.940 --> 10:15.831
YOU'RE LOOKING AT ME
LIKE YOU THOUGHT I MIGHT
STEAL YOUR CHICKEN SATAY.

10:15.940 --> 10:17.373
OH. NO, I JUST...

10:17.480 --> 10:20.176
I JUST THINK
YOU WERE GYPPED.

10:20.280 --> 10:21.872
HOW'S THAT?

10:21.980 --> 10:23.083
WELL, YOU WENT TO NEW YORK,

10:23.190 --> 10:26.648
AND ALL YOU GOT TO SEE
WAS THE INSIDE OF
A STUPID HOTEL.

10:26.760 --> 10:29.251
COME ON. THAT WAS
A BUSINESS SEMINAR,

10:29.360 --> 10:31.851
NOT A PLEASURE TRIP.

10:31.960 --> 10:33.894
SO YOU DIDN'T
GET TO DO ANYTHING.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.025
YOU DIDN'BEO SHOPPING

10:36.130 --> 10:37.688
GO TO A RESTAURANT?

10:37.800 --> 10:39.836
DO YOU WANT MY ITINERARY,
HANNA?

10:39.940 --> 10:43.137
IT WAS CONFERENCES
AND MEETINGS THE WHOLE TIME.

10:43.240 --> 10:46.778
AND THEN THEY MARCHED US OFF
TO A MUSICAL ON FRIDAY NIGHT
AS A REWARD.

10:46.880 --> 10:48.177
WHAT SHOW?

10:48.280 --> 10:50.305
"ANYTHING GOES."

10:51.410 --> 10:53.310
BRING ME THE PLATES.

11:01.760 --> 11:02.749
Aria: OKAY.

11:04.890 --> 11:06.187
GO.

11:07.500 --> 11:08.797
Woman in movie:
YOU BETTER LOOK AT THIS.

11:09.830 --> 11:10.728
MESSENGER BROUGHT IT
THIS MORNING.

11:11.330 --> 11:12.069
EIGHT-THIRTY-FIVE.

11:13.070 --> 11:16.699
THAT'S RIGHT.
TAKES A NICE PICTURE.

11:16.810 --> 11:19.904
I DON'T TRUST HER.
IT'S FILM NOIR.

11:20.010 --> 11:22.137
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED
TO TRUST ANYBODY.

11:22.240 --> 11:24.208
A WOMAN TELEPHONED ME
SHORTLY AFTER THIS THING
WAS DELIVERED.

11:24.310 --> 11:25.345
WHAT ELSE WAS THERE?

11:25.450 --> 11:28.669
WHY ARE DETECTIVE MOVIES
ALWAYS IN BLACK AND WHITE?

11:28.780 --> 11:31.943
BLACK AND WHITE'S
A DIFFERENT WORLD.

11:32.050 --> 11:33.688
I LOVE IT.

11:33.790 --> 11:35.052
HMM, I DON'T KNOW,

11:35.160 --> 11:36.923
I SEE IT A BLACK AND WHITE
MOVIE ON TV,

11:37.030 --> 11:39.157
AND I THINK
SOMETHING'S BROKEN.

11:40.860 --> 11:42.828
YOU'RE KIDDING, RIGHT?

11:42.930 --> 11:45.364
YOU KNOW WHERE
THIS PICTURE WAS TAKEN?

11:45.470 --> 11:48.030
I HAVEN'T
THE SLIGHTEST IDEA.

11:48.140 --> 11:49.960
( both laugh )

11:50.070 --> 11:52.368
I HAD YOU GOIN' FOR
A MINUTE, DIDN'T I?

11:56.510 --> 11:58.842
(TVoff)

11:58.950 --> 12:00.770
WHY'S IT MAKE YOU
SO NERVOUS,

12:00.880 --> 12:04.316
THE IDEA THAT
I MIGHT NOT LIKE SOMETHING
AS MUCH AS YOU DO?

12:04.420 --> 12:08.914
I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE
THAT WE HAVE STUFF IN COMMON,
YA KNOW?

12:09.020 --> 12:11.955
MM-HMM. IT'S GREAT
TO HAVE THINGS IN COMMON.

12:12.060 --> 12:16.861
BUT IF PEOPLE MATCH UP TOO MUCH,
THEN THERE AREN'T ANY SURPRISES.

12:16.970 --> 12:19.427
YEAH, THAT'D BE
PRETTY DULL.

12:19.530 --> 12:22.738
AND I DON'T THINK
YOU LIKE DULL.

12:22.840 --> 12:24.808
NO, I DON'T.

12:32.150 --> 12:34.243
SHE WAS IN ALL EVENING.

12:34.350 --> 12:37.080
POLICE ALREADY CHECKED THAT
WHEN THEY CALLED ABOUT OWEN.

12:37.190 --> 12:38.282
GO AHEAD AND SCRATCH.

12:53.570 --> 12:55.458
YOU TOLD THE EMT
YOU FELL OFF YOUR BIKE.

12:55.570 --> 12:56.832
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED.

12:56.940 --> 12:59.135
YOU HIT YOUR SHOULDER
PRETTY HARD.

12:59.240 --> 13:00.502
NO OTHER CUTS OR BRUISES.

13:00.610 --> 13:03.078
GUESS I'M LUCKY.

13:03.180 --> 13:05.000
I GUESS SO.

13:07.050 --> 13:10.918
I SENT THE X-RAYS AND MRI
FOR A CONSULT.

13:11.020 --> 13:12.510
LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE STILL
HAVING SOME DISCOMFORT.

13:12.620 --> 13:15.180
WOULD YOU LIKE ME
TO WRITE A PRESCRIPTION
FOR SOMETHING TO HELP?

13:15.290 --> 13:16.780
MAYBE HYDROCODON E?

13:16.890 --> 13:18.255
NO, I'VE HAD A BAD
REACTION TO THAT.

13:20.430 --> 13:22.523
I DON'T SEE THAT
IN YOUR FILE.

13:22.630 --> 13:24.188
WHO PRESCRIBED IT FOR YOU?

13:24.300 --> 13:27.963
I MEAN, I'VE HEARD YOU COULD
HAVE A BAD REACTION TO IT.

13:28.070 --> 13:29.492
ALL RIGHT.

13:29.600 --> 13:31.465
I'LL CALL WHEN I HEAR BACK
ON THE CONSULT.

13:31.570 --> 13:33.333
BYE.
OKAY.

13:33.440 --> 13:34.475
BYE.

13:39.480 --> 13:41.914
SORRY. I FORGOT
THAT I HAD THEM.

13:42.020 --> 13:44.944
THAT'S WHY THEY'RE
SUPPOSED TO LIVE IN
THE DISH BY THE FRONT DOOR.

13:45.050 --> 13:47.416
YOU KNOW, IT WOULD BE
A LOT EASIER IF I HAD
MY OWN SET.

13:47.520 --> 13:49.351
YEAH, IT WOULD.

13:53.260 --> 13:55.057
WHO ARE THESE FROM?

13:55.160 --> 13:56.092
THE BANK.

13:56.930 --> 13:57.965
I THINK THEY BOUGHT THEM
BY THE CARLOAD

13:58.700 --> 14:00.258
FOR EVERYONE
WHO WAS IN NEW YORK.

14:00.370 --> 14:03.237
OH. YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

14:34.400 --> 14:35.890
( telephone rings )

14:36.000 --> 14:37.308
HAN NA.

14:37.410 --> 14:38.968
HAN NA!

14:39.070 --> 14:40.298
( ringing )

14:48.420 --> 14:51.617
VIENNA'S A LONG WAY TO GO
FOR SOME STRUDEL.

14:52.620 --> 14:54.383
DEPENDS WHO
THE BAKER IS.
WOULD SHE GO?

14:55.760 --> 14:58.149
WELL, SHE SAYS NO,
BUT I THINK SHE'S ACTUALLY
THINKING ABOUT IT.

14:58.260 --> 15:00.990
WHAT DO YOU
THINK ABOUT IT?
I'M NOT SURE.

15:01.100 --> 15:03.022
I MEAN, I MISS HER
NOT BEING IN THE HOUSE,

15:03.130 --> 15:05.997
I CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE WHAT
IT'D BE LIKE IF SHE WAS ON
A DIFFERENT CONTINENT.

15:07.500 --> 15:09.559
ANY LUCK WITH
BIG BIRD'S PHONE NUMBER?

15:09.670 --> 15:13.071
NO. I PLUGGED IT INTO
EVERY REVERSE DIRECTORY
AND SEARCH ENGINE I COULD.

15:13.180 --> 15:15.375
BUT IT'S A REAL NUMBER;
IT'S GOING TO A REAL LINE.

15:15.480 --> 15:18.278
BUT I CAN'T EVEN FIND
A NAME OR EVEN A TOWN.

15:18.380 --> 15:20.041
DEAD END?
NO, NOT YET.

15:20.150 --> 15:21.469
I'M NOT GIVING UP ON IT.

15:21.580 --> 15:23.480
I STARTED GOING THROUGH
ALI'S NOTEBOOKS.

15:23.590 --> 15:25.615
THERE'S A LOT OF 'EM.
I COULD USE SOME HELP.

15:25.720 --> 15:27.051
I CAN COME OVER
TONIGHT.

15:27.160 --> 15:28.559
UM, I CAN'T TONIGHT.

15:28.660 --> 15:30.457
I PROMISED TOBY THAT
I WOULD HELP HIM
WITH SOMETHING.

15:30.560 --> 15:33.324
OKAY. I'M SURE
THE TWO OF US
CAN HANDLE IT.

15:33.430 --> 15:34.658
EMILY.

15:36.460 --> 15:37.563
MOM?

15:37.670 --> 15:39.092
I THOUGHT
I'D GIVE YOU A RIDE.

15:39.200 --> 15:41.259
OKAY. SURE.

15:41.370 --> 15:42.667
NOW, EMILY.

15:45.010 --> 15:48.173
WHAT'S GOING ON?
WE'LL TALK ABOUT IT
IN THE CAR.

15:48.280 --> 15:50.100
NO. IS DAD OKAY?

15:50.210 --> 15:51.609
YOUR FATHER'S FINE.

15:51.710 --> 15:54.941
THIS IS ABOUT YOU.
WHAT ABOUT ME?

15:55.050 --> 15:57.211
DR. VARGAS CALLED.

15:57.320 --> 16:00.050
HE WANTED TO KNOW
IF I'D EVER GIVEN YOU
ANY OF THE HYDROCODONE

16:00.160 --> 16:01.684
THAT I WAS PRESCRIBED
LAST YEAR.

16:01.790 --> 16:04.179
WHY WOULD HE ASK YOU THAT?

16:04.290 --> 16:06.679
HE SAID YOU WERE UNCERTAIN
IF YOU'D EVER TAKEN IT.

16:06.790 --> 16:08.621
I'VE NEVER TAKEN IT.

16:08.730 --> 16:13.235
EMILY, I CHECKED THE BOTTLE.
I COUNTED THE PILLS.

16:13.340 --> 16:15.194
NOW, I MIGHT BE
ONE OR TWO OFF,

16:15.300 --> 16:18.269
BUT THERE ARE MORE THAN
SEVEN PILLS MISSING.

16:18.370 --> 16:19.962
DID YOU TAKE THEM?

16:22.210 --> 16:23.370
I DIDN'T TAKE THEM.

16:23.480 --> 16:26.040
THEN WHERE DID THEY GO?

16:26.150 --> 16:28.744
EMILY, PLEASE,
I NEED SOME KIND OF
AN EXPLANATION.

16:28.850 --> 16:30.488
WHAT IS-- EMILY. HEY!

16:30.590 --> 16:32.046
LET'S GO. GET IN THE CAR.

16:32.150 --> 16:33.378
NO!
GET IN THE CAR.

16:33.490 --> 16:35.082
LET GO OF MY ARM!

16:37.590 --> 16:39.626
I'M SORRY.

16:39.730 --> 16:42.028
JUST GET IN THE CAR NOW.

16:42.130 --> 16:43.392
PLEASE.

16:51.070 --> 16:52.708
WHAT IS GOING ON?

16:52.810 --> 16:54.675
I HAVE NO IDEA.

16:59.280 --> 17:00.508
( cell phone rings )

17:13.660 --> 17:16.629
LOOK, MOST INNOCENT PEOPLE
DON'T HAVE ALIBIS

17:16.730 --> 17:18.197
BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW
THEY NEED THEM.

17:18.300 --> 17:19.699
YEAH, BUT MY MOM
LIED ABOUT WHERE SHE WAS.

17:19.800 --> 17:22.189
IT'S NOT THE SAME THING.
SHE WAS IN ROSEWOOD THAT NIGHT.

17:22.300 --> 17:24.165
ALL YOU KNOW IS THAT
SHE WASN'T AT THAT PLAY.

17:24.270 --> 17:26.761
I'M GONNA END UP
WITH A MOM OR A DAD.

17:28.540 --> 17:30.576
HAS YOUR MOM TALKED TO YOUR DAD
ABOUT THIS AT ALL?

17:30.680 --> 17:33.478
NO. MY PARENTS
COMMUNICATE THROUGH ATTORNEYS

17:33.580 --> 17:35.309
EVER SINCE MY DAD
AND HIS STEPFORD WIFE

17:35.420 --> 17:37.149
PULLED KATE OUT OF
ROSEWOOD HIGH.

17:39.550 --> 17:41.814
MAYBE TALKING TO AN ATTORNEY
ISN'T SUCH A BAD IDEA.

17:41.920 --> 17:44.354
YOU THINK
SHE DID SOMETHING?

17:44.460 --> 17:46.451
NO. I-- I'M JUST SAYING,

17:46.560 --> 17:48.721
THE GROUND ISN'T THAT
SOLID RIGHT NOW.

17:51.700 --> 17:53.668
Woman in background:
ROSEWOOD P.D.

18:56.460 --> 18:57.427
CAN I HELP YOU?

18:57.530 --> 18:59.691
OH. HI.

18:59.800 --> 19:01.529
( clears throat) UM...

19:01.640 --> 19:03.301
I WAS LOOKING FOR
PAM FIELDS,

19:03.410 --> 19:05.708
EMILY'S MOM?

19:05.810 --> 19:08.131
I-- I BROUGHT HER
SOME FLOWERS.

19:08.240 --> 19:09.332
WE SHOULD STEP OUTSIDE.

19:10.750 --> 19:12.377
UM, WHAT--

19:12.480 --> 19:13.708
WHAT IS ALL THAT?

19:13.820 --> 19:15.617
IT'S HOW YOU BREAK DOWN
A MURDER CASE.

19:15.720 --> 19:17.745
IF YOU WANT TO SOLVE IT.

19:17.850 --> 19:21.581
AND EVERYTHING ON THAT BOARD
HAS TO DO WITH
WHO KILLED WILDEN?

19:21.690 --> 19:23.658
MOST OF IT.

19:23.760 --> 19:26.479
WELL, WHY IS MY NAME
ON THAT BOARD?

19:26.590 --> 19:28.319
LOTS OF PEOPLE
ON THAT BOARD.

19:28.430 --> 19:31.263
PEOPLE WHO KNEW HIM,
PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T EVEN
KNOW THEY KNEW HIM.

19:31.370 --> 19:33.691
ONE BY ONE, YOU TAKE
PEOPLE OFF THE LIST.

19:33.800 --> 19:36.769
JUST PART OF THE PROCESS.
NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.

19:36.870 --> 19:38.861
YEAH, UNLESS YOU'RE
THE LAST NAME LEFT.

19:38.970 --> 19:40.801
WELL, THEN YOU MIGHT
HAVE A PROBLEM.

19:40.910 --> 19:43.674
( no audible dialogue )

19:45.350 --> 19:46.772
EXCUSE ME.

19:48.580 --> 19:50.286
MISS HASTINGS.

19:52.690 --> 19:54.715
( no audible dialogue )

20:12.640 --> 20:14.904
( car alarms chirps )

20:15.010 --> 20:17.478
MR. MARIN.

20:17.580 --> 20:19.878
CALEB.
I DIDN'T WANT TO
BOTHER YOU IN YOUR OFFICE.

20:19.980 --> 20:21.811
I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE
YOU KNEW WHAT WAS GOING ON.

20:21.920 --> 20:24.514
WHAT EXACTLY
ARE WE TALKING ABOUT?

20:24.620 --> 20:25.848
DETECTIVE WILDEN.

20:25.950 --> 20:28.350
WHAT'S THAT GOT
TO DO WITH ME?

20:28.460 --> 20:30.553
YOU KNOW THAT HE WAS BOTHERING
YOUR WIFE AND YOUR DAUGHTER.

20:30.660 --> 20:32.821
HANNA'S MOTHER
IS MY EX-WIFE.
THE POINT IS,

20:32.930 --> 20:34.488
HE WAS GIVING THEM
A HARD TIME,

20:34.600 --> 20:36.727
AND IT WASN'T EXACTLY
A SECRET.

20:36.830 --> 20:38.661
NOW HE'S DEAD.

20:38.770 --> 20:40.260
YES, WE'VE ESTABLISHED THAT.

20:40.370 --> 20:42.998
HEY, THEY'RE BRINGING IN
SOME STATE INVESTIGATORS.

20:43.100 --> 20:45.933
HANNA'S WORRIED THAT
THEY'RE GONNA TRY TO
PIN IT ON HER MOM.

20:46.040 --> 20:48.679
IF THAT HAPPENS,
THEY ARE BOTH
GONNA NEED HELP.

20:48.780 --> 20:50.668
WHAT KIND OF HELP?

20:50.780 --> 20:53.772
HANNA'S MOM'S GONNA
NEED A LAWYER, AND HANNA...

20:53.880 --> 20:57.509
HANNA NEEDS TO KNOW THAT
YOU'RE GONNA BE THERE FOR HER.

20:57.620 --> 20:59.383
OKAY? SHE NEEDS HER FATHER.

21:02.590 --> 21:05.479
I'LL KEEP ALL THIS IN MIND.
THANK YOU, CALEB.

21:05.590 --> 21:07.820
YOU'RE WELCOME.

21:07.930 --> 21:09.818
I THINK.

21:09.930 --> 21:10.999
( starts car)

21:13.740 --> 21:16.459
HEY, DID YOU END UP
TELLING YOUR MOM THAT
YOU TOOK HER PILLS?

21:16.570 --> 21:17.730
HAD TO.

21:17.840 --> 21:19.364
BUT DID YOU TELL HER WHY
YOU TOOK THEM?

21:19.470 --> 21:21.279
WHICH "WHY" SHOULD I TELL?

21:21.380 --> 21:23.905
THE ONE I TOLD THE EMTs,
OR THE ONE I TOLD PAIGE?

21:24.010 --> 21:26.478
I'M NOT DOING WELL ON
THE LIE DETECTOR THIS WEEK.

21:26.580 --> 21:28.411
IT WASN'T THAT BIG OF A LIE.

21:28.520 --> 21:29.942
DO YOU HEAR YOURSELF?

21:30.050 --> 21:32.689
I TOOK MY MOM'S
PRESCRIPTION MEDS.

21:32.790 --> 21:36.419
IT'S NOT THAT BIG OF A LIE
COMPARED TO EVERYTHING ELSE
WE'VE HAD TO DEAL WITH.

21:36.520 --> 21:39.683
I DON'T EVEN WANT TO THINK ABOUT
THE SIZE OF THE STORY WE'RE
GONNA HAVE TO COME UP WITH

21:39.790 --> 21:42.429
IF SOMEBODY SEES THAT
VIDEO OF US IN WILDEN'S CAR.

21:52.640 --> 21:54.505
EM.
WHAT?

21:54.610 --> 21:56.077
LOOK AT THIS.
TELL ME WHAT YOU SEE.

22:01.050 --> 22:04.087
OH, MY GOD. IT'S ALI.

22:04.190 --> 22:07.079
THIS LOOKS LIKE THE MASK
THAT HANNA SAW ON THE TRAIN.

22:07.190 --> 22:09.750
AND IT MAY BE THE ONE
THAT ALL OF US SAW
AT THE LODGE.

22:09.860 --> 22:11.623
WHY DID ALI HAVE ONE?

22:11.730 --> 22:15.359
BECAUSE SHE WAS THE ORIGINAL.
SHE MUST HAVE MODELED FOR IT.

22:15.460 --> 22:17.052
WHY WOULD SHE DO
SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

22:17.160 --> 22:19.367
"THAT'S IMMORTALITY,
MY DARLINGS."

22:19.470 --> 22:21.597
WHY DID MONA HAVE A COPY?
I DON'T KNOW,

22:21.700 --> 22:22.997
BUT WE CAN'T ASK MONA.

22:23.100 --> 22:26.001
WAIT, LOOK.
THERE'S A MARK
STAMPED ON THE BACK.

22:29.610 --> 22:34.377
* IN THE PERSON
THERE'S A CRACK *

22:34.480 --> 22:36.414
* I'VE SEEN YOUR DARK SIDE,
NOW-- *

22:36.520 --> 22:38.010
I DO NOT APPRECIATE YOU
SPYING ON ME.

22:38.120 --> 22:40.953
I WAS NOT SPYING.
I JUST HAPPENED TO LOOK
IN THE WASTE BASKET.

22:41.060 --> 22:43.858
YOU DELIBERATELY LOOKED.
YOU LIED TO ME.

22:43.960 --> 22:46.053
I DO NOT HAVE TO
ACCOUNT FOR MYSELF TO YOU!

22:46.160 --> 22:48.549
MOM, I DON'T CARE ABOUT
THE STUPID PLAY, ALL RIGHT?

22:48.660 --> 22:50.628
BUT WHY WOULD YOU
LIE ABOUT IT?

22:50.730 --> 22:53.631
DO NOT ASK ME
ANY MORE QUESTIONS.

22:56.500 --> 22:57.899
HAN NA.

22:59.210 --> 23:01.633
IF ANYONE ASKS YOU...

23:01.740 --> 23:03.901
I'LL SAY YOU WERE
AT THE SHOW.

23:04.010 --> 23:05.841
DON'T LIE.

23:05.950 --> 23:08.578
JUST DON'T SAY ANYTHING.

23:10.790 --> 23:12.519
( door closes )

23:14.020 --> 23:15.817
( phone rings )

23:19.160 --> 23:20.149
HELLO.

23:21.630 --> 23:25.396
OKAY. IF WE GO THROUGH
THE CHILDREN'S WING
AND THE SERVICE CORRIDOR,

23:25.500 --> 23:27.127
WE CAN UPSTAIRS WITHOUT
GOING THROUGH THE WARDS.

23:27.230 --> 23:28.868
WHAT IF THEY
CHANGED THE CODES?

23:28.970 --> 23:31.859
MONA DIDN'T GIVE ME THE CODES.
SHE GAVE ME THE OVERRIDE
NUMBERS.

23:31.970 --> 23:34.006
MONA MUST HAVE BEEN
VERY IMPRESSED WITH YOU.

23:34.110 --> 23:35.600
I'M A FAST LEARNER.

23:39.050 --> 23:40.745
IT'S THE SAME ONE.

23:40.850 --> 23:42.818
NOT THE SAME MASK
MONA HAD ON THE TRAIN,

23:42.920 --> 23:45.718
BUT IT'S THE SAME FACE,
THE SAME EXPRESSION.

23:45.820 --> 23:47.879
THEY'RE FROM THE SAME MOLD.
TURN IT OVER.

23:49.520 --> 23:51.522
"HECTOR LIME.
DIMENSIONAL ARTIST."

23:51.630 --> 23:53.120
THAT'S HIS WEB ADDRESS
UNDER HIS NAME.

23:53.230 --> 23:55.448
HIS STUDIO'S ON THE FAR SIDE
OF TORCH LAKE.

23:55.560 --> 23:58.563
HE MAKES MASKS AND STATUES
AND PROPS FOR HORROR FILMS.

23:58.670 --> 24:00.535
ALI WENT THERE,
AND HE COPIED HER FACE.

24:00.640 --> 24:02.437
IF HE MADE ONE,
HE MUST HAVE MADE OTHERS.

24:02.540 --> 24:04.667
THAT'S WHY WE CALLED
YOU AND SPENCER.
WHERE IS SPENCER?

24:04.770 --> 24:06.635
I DON'T KNOW. THE CALL
WENT STRAIGHT TO VOICEMAIL.

24:06.740 --> 24:09.174
ALI WAS AT THE STUDIO.
BOTH MASKS CAME FROM
THE SAME PLACE.

24:09.280 --> 24:11.544
YEAH, BUT WE DON'T KNOW
HOW MANY THERE ARE
OR WHO HAS THEM...

24:11.650 --> 24:14.847
AND IF THEY GOT THEM FROM ALI
OR FROM THIS GUY'S STUDIO.

24:14.950 --> 24:16.611
LET'S GO FIND OUT.

24:16.720 --> 24:19.917
SHOULDN'T WE
WAIT FOR SPENCER?

24:20.020 --> 24:22.215
NO, WE CAN HANDLE THIS
ON OUR OWN.

24:24.860 --> 24:27.852
WHAT? WE CAN'T MAKE A MOVE
WITHOUT NANCY DREW?

24:27.960 --> 24:32.499
THIS MASK CONNECTS US TO ALI
AND THE HALLOWEEN TRAIN,
WHICH CONNECTS US TO WILDEN.

24:32.600 --> 24:34.989
THE POLICE HAVE OUR NAMES
ON A BOARD WITH ARROWS
AND GRAPHS,

24:35.100 --> 24:37.603
AND NOT JUST OURS--
MY MOM'S UP THERE.

24:37.710 --> 24:40.804
SO I'M NOT WAITING FOR SPENCER,
BECAUSE "A's" NOT WAITING
FOR ANYONE. NOW COME ON.

24:42.080 --> 24:44.002
I FEEL LIKE
I JUST GOT DRAFTED.

24:53.250 --> 24:56.515
Aria: ALI CAME OUT HERE ALONE?
Hanna: SHE MUST HAVE.

24:58.030 --> 25:00.487
THERE'S SOMEONE ON THE PORCH.

25:01.800 --> 25:03.097
Aria: HELLO?

25:11.070 --> 25:13.834
OKAY, SHOULD WE
TALK ABOUT THIS PLAN?

25:17.680 --> 25:20.808
I LIKE IT BETTER
WHEN PEOPLE CALL FIRST.

25:20.920 --> 25:22.740
THAT'S WHAT IT SAYS
IN THE AD.

25:24.990 --> 25:25.979
UM...

25:29.060 --> 25:30.584
DID YOU, UH,

25:30.690 --> 25:32.681
DID YOU MAKE THIS?

25:38.200 --> 25:41.863
WELL...

25:41.970 --> 25:43.608
YOU BETTER COME IN.

26:20.270 --> 26:23.103
THE FILE SAYS IT WAS
THE EAST SIDE WINDOW.

26:32.390 --> 26:33.982
THAT'S GOTTA BE IT.

26:47.200 --> 26:49.191
THIS IS WHERE SHE DID IT.

26:53.440 --> 26:56.170
SHE HAD HER SESSION
WITH DR. PALMER,

26:56.280 --> 26:58.748
ALL ABOUT HOW MUCH
SHE WANTED TO LIVE...

27:00.150 --> 27:03.813
THEN SHE STOLE A KEY
FROM THE NURSES STATION...

27:03.920 --> 27:05.387
AND SHE CAME IN HERE...

27:07.420 --> 27:09.809
SHE UNLOCKED THE WINDOW...

27:16.160 --> 27:18.264
I WANTED THE TRUTH.

27:20.870 --> 27:23.338
WELL...

27:23.440 --> 27:25.328
HERE IT IS.

27:28.180 --> 27:31.775
OH, MY GOD, SPENCE...

27:31.880 --> 27:34.644
I GAVE THE RV TO "A"
FOR NOTHING.

27:44.930 --> 27:48.252
I HATE IT WHEN PEOPLE
DO THIS TO MY WORK.

27:48.360 --> 27:49.998
SO IT IS YOURS.

27:52.370 --> 27:54.292
MY STAMP ON THE BACK.

27:54.400 --> 27:56.994
WHICH I GUESS
IS HOW YOU GOT HERE?

27:57.100 --> 27:59.000
WHY'D YOU MAKE IT?

27:59.110 --> 28:01.169
DIDN'T YOUR FRIEND TELL YOU?

28:01.280 --> 28:04.408
NO, SHE DIDN'T.
SHE'S DEAD.

28:06.080 --> 28:08.947
SO, UM, HOW DID YOU GUYS MEET?

28:09.050 --> 28:11.848
WELL, I PUT AN AD
ON THE INTERNET.

28:11.950 --> 28:13.815
I WAS LOOKING FOR A MODEL.

28:13.920 --> 28:17.253
I NEEDED A JOAN OF ARC.

28:17.360 --> 28:19.885
SOMEONE YOUNG AND...

28:19.990 --> 28:21.719
BEAUTIFUL...

28:21.830 --> 28:23.297
AND A WARRIOR.

28:26.070 --> 28:28.698
YOUR FRIEND WAS PERFECT.

28:28.800 --> 28:32.099
SO YOU USED HER
FOR JOAN OF ARC.
WHAT ABOUT THE MASK?

28:32.210 --> 28:35.429
YOU WOULD MAKE
A GREAT MEDUSA.

28:38.080 --> 28:39.172
THANK YOU.

28:39.280 --> 28:40.247
I'VE GOT A CLIENT

28:41.150 --> 28:42.412
WHO WOULD LOVE YOU
AS MEDUSA.

28:43.380 --> 28:44.779
I COULD DO IT WHERE
THE SNAKES ACT UALLY--

28:45.690 --> 28:46.714
YOU WERE TELLING US
ABOUT OUR FRIEND.

28:47.620 --> 28:48.757
HOW MANY OF THOSE MASKS
DID YOU MAKE?

28:48.860 --> 28:50.885
SUPPOSE WE DO
A LITTLE BARTER.

28:50.990 --> 28:52.252
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I KNOW,

28:52.360 --> 28:55.420
AND YOU GIVE ME
SOMETHING IN RETURN.

28:55.530 --> 28:57.498
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

28:59.830 --> 29:01.764
YOUR FACE.

29:10.950 --> 29:13.271
BUT ARE YOU SURE THAT
THIS IS THE RIGHT ROOM?

29:13.380 --> 29:15.940
THIS IS THE ROOM.

29:16.050 --> 29:17.745
WHAT ARE YOU GETTING AT?

29:17.850 --> 29:19.215
LOOK AT THE ROOF.

29:19.320 --> 29:21.982
SEE HOW IT JUTS OUT,
WHAT, 10, 15 FEET

29:22.090 --> 29:24.422
ALL THE WAY
AROUND THE BUILDING?

29:24.530 --> 29:27.385
HOW COULD SOMEBODY
WHO JUMPED FROM HERE

29:27.490 --> 29:30.288
HAVE CLEARED THAT ROOF
AND THEN FALL CLEAN
TO THE GROUND?

29:30.400 --> 29:34.291
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOUR MOM FELL,
BUT I DON'T THINK SHE JUMPED--

29:34.400 --> 29:36.163
NOT FROM HERE.

29:38.340 --> 29:41.070
I THINK "A" GAVE YOU
SOMETHING REAL.

29:43.950 --> 29:45.440
I'VE GOTTA FIND
DR. PALMER.

29:45.550 --> 29:49.077
I'VE GOTTA TALK TO SOMEBODY
WHO SAW HER THAT DAY.

29:49.180 --> 29:52.115
HEY. WE'LL FIND HIM.

29:56.060 --> 29:58.051
THE WHOLE THING WILL BE OVER
BEFORE YOU KNOW IT.

29:59.990 --> 30:03.994
WELL, YOU BETTER ASK YOUR
QUESTIONS WHILE YOU STILL CAN.

30:04.100 --> 30:07.024
IS THIS WHAT YOU DID WITH ALI
TO COPY HER FACE?

30:07.130 --> 30:08.791
YES, THAT'S RIGHT.

30:08.900 --> 30:10.333
SO YOU USED HER
FOR JOAN OF ARC,

30:10.440 --> 30:12.169
BUT WHAT ABOUT THE MASK?

30:12.270 --> 30:14.875
WELL, THAT WAS ALISON'S IDEA.
SHE ASKED ME TO MAKE THEM.

30:14.980 --> 30:17.198
SHE SAID SHE WANTED MASKS
FOR ALL HER FRIENDS

30:17.310 --> 30:19.244
SO THEY COULD LOOK LIKE HER.

30:19.350 --> 30:22.342
I MADE THEM.
HARD MASKS AND SOFT ONES.

30:22.450 --> 30:24.338
THEY TURNED OUT VERY WELL.

30:24.450 --> 30:26.418
DID YOU MAKE THEM
FOR ANYONE ELSE?

30:26.520 --> 30:29.455
LOOK, WE HAVE TO GET STARTED.
THIS STUFF SETS UP FAST.

30:29.560 --> 30:32.927
SO JUST...RELAX,
SIT BACK.

30:52.380 --> 30:55.076
( gasps, exhales )

30:56.650 --> 30:58.288
YOU'RE DOING FINE.

31:08.000 --> 31:10.525
YOU WERE TELLING US
ABOUT ALISON.

31:10.630 --> 31:13.394
YES. ALISON ORDERED THE MASKS,

31:13.500 --> 31:15.866
I MADE THEM
AND HANDED THEM OVER.

31:18.010 --> 31:19.432
DID YOU KEEP ANY?

31:19.540 --> 31:21.405
I BROKE THE MOLD
WHEN I WAS FINISHED.

31:21.510 --> 31:23.899
WHY?
BECAUSE SHE TOLD ME TO.

31:45.370 --> 31:47.429
YOU AND I NEED TO TALK.

31:47.530 --> 31:51.660
Hector: NOW, I WANT YOU
TO BREATHE IN THROUGH YOUR NOSE

31:51.770 --> 31:54.671
AND BREATHE OUT GENTLY
THROUGH YOUR MOUTH.

32:01.680 --> 32:03.238
OH, THAT'S PERFECT.

32:04.590 --> 32:06.581
IT'S PERFECT!

32:11.030 --> 32:13.453
THE WHOLE TIME
I WAS THINKING OF ALI

32:13.560 --> 32:16.688
AND HOW THAT'S WHAT IT MUST
FEEL LIKE TO BE BURIED ALIVE.

32:16.800 --> 32:18.062
DID YOU FIND ANYTHING?

32:18.170 --> 32:19.967
YEAH,
I FOUND SOMETHING.

32:26.340 --> 32:28.103
IF YOU'RE INVOLVED IN THIS,

32:28.210 --> 32:30.371
IF ASHLEY
SENT YOU TO ME,
JUST SAY SO.

32:30.480 --> 32:33.142
NOBODY SENT ME TO YOU,
MR. MARIN, OKAY?

32:35.050 --> 32:38.383
YOU KNEW THAT SHE WAS
IN ROSEWOOD THAT NIGHT.

32:43.290 --> 32:45.224
HANNA'S MOM.

32:47.590 --> 32:50.229
DID SHE TELL YOU,
OR DID YOU SEE HER?

32:58.210 --> 33:02.101
I SAW HER.
SHE CAME TO MY HOUSE
AROUND NINE O'CLOCK.

33:02.210 --> 33:05.304
ISABELLE HAD SOME PEOPLE OVER,
SO WE TALKED IN MY OFFICE
ABOVE THE GARAGE.

33:05.410 --> 33:07.708
SHE SAY ANYTHING
ABOUT WILDEN?
NOPE.

33:07.810 --> 33:12.042
SHE CALLED ME, CAME OVER,
SAID SHE NEEDED MONEY,

33:12.150 --> 33:15.688
MORE MONEY THAN I HAD--
WE'RE NOT VERY LIQUID
RIGHT NOW.

33:15.790 --> 33:19.453
AND WHAT HAPPENED
WHEN YOU TOLD HER NO?

33:19.560 --> 33:21.494
ISABELLE WANTED ME
FOR SOMETHING.

33:21.600 --> 33:23.727
I CAME BACK,
ASHLEY WAS GONE.

33:28.170 --> 33:30.035
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME THAT
THIS AFTERNOON?

33:35.680 --> 33:38.308
YOU'RE JUST ON THE EDGE
OF THIS RIGHT NOW.

33:38.410 --> 33:40.275
YOU COULD STILL WALK AWAY.

33:40.380 --> 33:42.678
I LOVE YOUR DAUGHTER,
MR. MARIN.

33:47.720 --> 33:50.018
AFTER WE TALKED TODAY,

33:50.120 --> 33:52.054
I WENT HOME,
I WENT UP TO MY OFFICE,

33:52.160 --> 33:54.697
AND I DID SOMETHING
I'VE BEEN AFRAID TO DO
SINCE WILDEN GOT SHOT.

33:56.160 --> 33:58.367
I KEEP A GUN LOCKED IN MY DESK.

33:58.470 --> 34:01.394
I LOOKED FOR IT.
IT'S MISSING.

34:10.740 --> 34:13.140
( knocking on door)

34:13.250 --> 34:14.444
COME IN.

34:18.450 --> 34:21.351
I THOUGHT WE HAD
AN UNDERSTANDING ABOUT
YOU WERE STAYING IN TONIGHT.

34:21.460 --> 34:23.212
HANNA NEEDED MY HELP.

34:23.320 --> 34:24.719
WHAT'S THIS?

34:24.830 --> 34:27.219
NOTHING. IT'S JUST CLAY.

34:33.270 --> 34:35.795
DID SOMEONE
FROM FAMILY SERVICES
CALL YOU?

34:35.900 --> 34:38.562
FAMILY SERVICES? NO.

34:38.670 --> 34:41.104
WELL, THEY CALLED ME.
THEY WANT TO INTERVIEW ME.

34:41.210 --> 34:43.201
ABOUT WHAT?
ABOUT YOU.

34:46.350 --> 34:51.378
APPARENTLY SOMEONE THOUGHT
I WAS A LITTLE EXCESSIVE
WITH YOU OUTSIDE THE SCHOOL.

34:51.490 --> 34:53.788
SO THEY CALLED FAMILY SERVICES.

34:53.890 --> 34:56.711
AND SOME SNIPPY LITTLE
BUREAUCRAT

34:56.820 --> 34:59.152
SAYS THAT THEY DETECT
SOME KIND OF A PATTERN.

34:59.260 --> 35:01.228
WHAT KIND OF A PATTERN?

35:01.330 --> 35:02.820
YOUR SHOULDER,

35:02.930 --> 35:05.467
HOW YOU WOUND UP IN THE HOSPITAL
WITH AN ULCER,

35:05.570 --> 35:09.233
THE TROUBLE THAT YOU'VE HAD
WITH THE POLICE...

35:10.470 --> 35:13.633
THE FACT THAT YOUR DAD IS...
AWAY SO MUCH.

35:16.340 --> 35:18.103
SHE EVEN TALKED
TO DR. VARGAS.

35:18.210 --> 35:21.646
WHO TALKED TO DR. VARGAS?
THE SOCIAL WORKER.

35:21.750 --> 35:25.789
WHATEVER HAPPENED TO PRIVACY
IN THIS COUNTRY, ANYWAY?

35:25.890 --> 35:27.846
I DON'T KNOW.

35:27.950 --> 35:31.784
LOOK, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
WE'LL GET THIS STRAIGHTENED OUT.

35:34.900 --> 35:36.595
( door closes )

35:51.410 --> 35:55.346
SO, A DECAF,
NON-FAT ICED MOCHA.

35:55.450 --> 35:57.475
THAT'S PRETTY MUCH A GLASS
OF CHOCOLATE MILK, RIGHT?

35:57.580 --> 36:01.141
YEAH, PRETTY MUCH,
BUT YOU FEEL MORE GROWN UP
WHEN YOU ORDER IT.

36:02.660 --> 36:04.548
WILL YOU EXCUSE ME
FOR A SECOND?

36:04.660 --> 36:06.150
SURE.

36:08.860 --> 36:11.397
YOU HAVE TO GO TO VIENNA
WITH ZACK.

36:11.500 --> 36:12.762
WHAT?
GO WITH HIM.

36:12.870 --> 36:15.691
I AM ORDERING YOU
TO FOLLOW YOUR BLISS.

36:15.800 --> 36:17.438
ARE YOU TRYING
TO GET RID OF ME?

36:17.540 --> 36:19.861
I'M TRYING TO GET YOU
TO GO ON AN ADVENTURE.

36:19.970 --> 36:22.507
MOM, MIKE AND I, WE'RE GONNA
BE JUST FINE WITH DAD.

36:22.610 --> 36:26.171
WELL, AS LONG AS
HE DOESN'T TRY TO MAKE THAT
VEGETARIAN LASAGNA AGAIN.

36:26.280 --> 36:27.941
ARIA, I THINK I KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO.

36:28.050 --> 36:30.610
BUT YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND,
I'VE THOUGHT ABOUT THIS A LOT,

36:30.720 --> 36:32.483
AND IT JUST WON'T BE EASY
FOR ANYBODY.

36:32.590 --> 36:34.581
PASSION ISN'T SUPPOSED
TO BE EASY.

36:34.690 --> 36:36.510
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE PASSIONATE.

36:38.060 --> 36:40.824
I AM NOT GONNA SIT HERE
AND DISCUSS PASSION
WITH MY DAUGHTER.

36:40.930 --> 36:42.329
THEN DON'T DISCUSS IT,

36:43.430 --> 36:45.227
AND DO NOT TALK YOURSELF
OUT OF SOMETHING THAT YOU WANT

36:45.330 --> 36:48.595
AND IS SOMETHING
THAT YOU DESERVE.

36:48.700 --> 36:51.601
MOM, PLEASE DO THIS.

36:51.710 --> 36:54.577
PLEASE? I NEED
THE INSPIRATION.

36:58.550 --> 37:01.439
IT WOULD CERTAINLY BE
SOMETHING TO TELL
THE GRANDKIDS.

37:01.550 --> 37:03.848
ABSOLUTELY.

37:23.370 --> 37:26.703
IT'S NONE OF MY BUSINESS,
BUT THAT LOOKED KIND OF INTENSE.

37:26.810 --> 37:28.402
NO, NOT REALLY.

37:29.780 --> 37:31.907
I WAS JUST GIVING MY MOTHER
PERMISSION TO GO OFF
AND JOIN THE CIRCUS.

37:32.010 --> 37:33.875
THAT WAS NICE OF YOU.

37:35.680 --> 37:37.739
WILL YOU MISS HER?

37:42.420 --> 37:43.455
I'M--I'M SORRY.

37:43.560 --> 37:45.289
NO, NO. IT'S GONNA BE OKAY.

37:45.390 --> 37:46.618
REALLY. I--

37:48.660 --> 37:50.525
SHE NEEDS TO GO.

37:50.630 --> 37:51.699
( laughter )

37:57.800 --> 38:00.667
WHERE WERE YOU?
WHY WEREN'T YOU
ANSWERING YOUR PHONE?

38:00.770 --> 38:03.603
I WAS WITH TOBY.
WE JUST WANTED
SOME PRIVACY, OKAY?

38:03.710 --> 38:06.577
WELL, LOOK IN HERE
AND SEE WHAT YOU MISSED.

38:11.790 --> 38:13.678
MELISSA?
YEAH.

38:13.790 --> 38:15.553
THAT'S WHAT WE SAID
WHEN WE SAW IT.

38:17.020 --> 38:18.954
THIS WAS FROM THE STUDIO
THAT ALI WENT TO?
MELISSA MUST HAVE BEEN THERE.

38:19.060 --> 38:22.029
HE COPIED YOUR SISTER'S FACE
JUST LIKE HE DID ALISON'S.

38:23.500 --> 38:26.697
SO DID MELISSA FOLLOW ALI THERE,
OR DID ALI FOLLOW MELLISSA?

38:26.800 --> 38:29.439
MAYBE THEY WENT TOGETHER.

38:53.430 --> 38:55.625
( water running )

39:03.170 --> 39:04.535
MOM?

39:08.110 --> 39:10.704
Ashley: YES, HANNA?

39:10.810 --> 39:13.005
I JUST WANTED TO
LET YOU KNOW THAT I'M BACK.

39:14.480 --> 39:15.742
ALL RIGHT.

39:19.820 --> 39:21.879
HAN NA?
YEAH?

39:24.630 --> 39:25.983
I'M SORRY.

39:27.130 --> 39:29.894
ABOUT...BEFORE.

39:32.030 --> 39:34.021
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

39:35.570 --> 39:37.367
ARE YOU OKAY?

39:37.470 --> 39:40.030
YES, I'M FINE.

39:40.140 --> 39:41.903
DON'T WORRY.

39:52.190 --> 39:54.488
( water continues running )

40:13.010 --> 40:14.136
( knocking on door)

40:15.480 --> 40:16.970
COME IN.

40:23.050 --> 40:26.417
I SAW HANNA AT
THE POLICE STATION TODAY.

40:26.520 --> 40:29.683
DID SHE MENTION THAT?
YEAH, SHE DID.

40:29.790 --> 40:31.724
I WAS WONDERING WHAT
SHE WAS DOING THERE.

40:31.830 --> 40:34.082
SHE WAS WONDERING
THE SAME THING ABOUT YOU.

40:34.190 --> 40:36.795
THE NEW INVESTIGATOR
ASKED ME TO COME IN.

40:36.900 --> 40:39.095
HE WANTED TO TALK ABOUT
DARREN WILDEN.

40:39.200 --> 40:41.737
I THINK THEY'RE TALKING TO
EVERYBODY WHO HAD ANYTHING
TO DO WITH HIM.

40:41.840 --> 40:43.933
WERE YOU OF ANY HELP?

40:44.040 --> 40:47.703
I DON'T THINK SO.
I HARDLY KNEW HIM.

40:47.810 --> 40:49.698
YOU GUYS WENT TO
HIGH SCHOOL TOGETHER.

40:49.810 --> 40:53.541
SEEMS LIKE SUCH
A LONG TIME AGO.

40:53.650 --> 40:56.847
SO MUCH HAS HAPPENED SINCE THEN.

40:56.950 --> 40:59.987
DO YOU EVER THINK ABOUT
HOW MUCH HAS CHANGED?

41:00.090 --> 41:03.753
ALL THE PEOPLE
THAT ARE GONE?

41:03.860 --> 41:05.179
YEAH, I DO.

41:05.290 --> 41:07.121
WHAT DOES IT ALL MEAN?

41:08.930 --> 41:13.867
UH...I THINK THAT'S
AN AWFUL BIG QUESTION
FOR THIS TIME OF NIGHT.

41:18.870 --> 41:22.772
DO YOU SUPPOSE OTHER SISTERS
HAVE AS MUCH TROUBLE
GETTING ALONG AS WE DO?

41:22.880 --> 41:24.609
THERE MIGHT BE A FEW.

41:24.710 --> 41:26.849
MAYBE WE'RE JUST
TOO MUCH ALIKE,

41:26.950 --> 41:29.475
AND THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

41:29.580 --> 41:31.844
MAYBE.
I DON'T KNOW.

41:34.050 --> 41:37.019
YOU ASKED ME A QUESTION ONCE.
MM-HMM.

41:37.120 --> 41:41.557
IF IT CAME DOWN TO PROTECTING
YOU OR PROTECTING SOMEBODY ELSE,

41:41.660 --> 41:44.993
SOMEBODY I LOVED,
WHO WOULD I PICK?

41:45.100 --> 41:47.898
DO YOU REMEMBER?

41:48.000 --> 41:49.729
YEAH, I DO.

41:49.840 --> 41:52.809
WHAT WOULD YOUR ANSWER BE

41:52.910 --> 41:54.832
IF I ASKED YOU
THE SAME QUESTION?

41:56.840 --> 42:01.106
IF YOU HAD TO CHOOSE...
WHAT WOULD YOU DO?

42:12.160 --> 42:13.980
( buzzing )

42:22.740 --> 42:25.903
( footsteps approach,
knock on door )

42:26.010 --> 42:28.160
EMILY?

42:28.270 --> 42:29.806
I'M AWAKE.

42:29.910 --> 42:33.243
I THOUGHT YOU SHOULD KNOW.
YOUR DAD'S COMING HOME.

42:33.350 --> 42:35.648
HE IS?

42:35.750 --> 42:39.049
I JUST GOT OFF THE PHONE
WITH HIM.

42:39.150 --> 42:42.711
FAMILY SERVICES
CALLED HIM, TOO.

43:03.110 --> 43:06.841
* YOUR KNEE BONE CONNECTED TO
YOUR THIGH BONE *

43:06.950 --> 43:10.169
* YOUR THIGH BONE CONNECTED
TO YOUR HIP BONE *

43:10.280 --> 43:13.784
* YOUR HIP BONE CONNECTED TO
YOUR BACKBONE *

43:13.890 --> 43:17.212
* YOUR BACKBONE CONNECTED
TO YOUR SHOULDER BONE *

43:17.320 --> 43:20.585
* YOUR SHOULDER BONE CONNECTED
TO YOUR NECK BONE *

43:20.690 --> 43:23.955
* YOUR NECK BONE CONNECTED TO
YOUR HEAD BONE *

43:24.060 --> 43:27.268
* NOW HEAR
THE WORD OF THE LORD *

43:27.370 --> 43:30.737
* DEM BONES, DEM BONES
GONNA WALK AROUND... *
