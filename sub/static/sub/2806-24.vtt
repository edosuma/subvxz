00:02.419 --> 00:03.419
Oh, my God.

00:03.586 --> 00:07.006
I know. Monica's gonna have a baby.

00:07.215 --> 00:09.967
Can this count as her "something new"?

00:10.885 --> 00:12.261
Oh, my God.

00:15.932 --> 00:18.350
Do you think this is why Chandler took off?

00:18.601 --> 00:22.855
She had to have just taken it.
I took out the trash last night.

00:23.064 --> 00:25.566
It's turning into the worst wedding ever.

00:25.775 --> 00:30.279
The bride's pregnant, the groom's missing
and I'm holding this.

00:31.281 --> 00:35.951
Phoebe, we cannot tell anyone about this.

00:36.161 --> 00:38.203
- Right. Yeah.
- Okay?

00:38.455 --> 00:41.874
Do you know what kind
of birth control she uses?

00:42.125 --> 00:43.125
No. Why?

00:43.376 --> 00:47.379
Just for the future.
This is hardly a commercial for it.

01:09.277 --> 01:10.277
Anything?

01:10.445 --> 01:13.822
No. I talked to Joey.
He hasn't heard from him.

01:14.074 --> 01:16.658
I talked to Chandler's parents again.

01:16.868 --> 01:18.869
- You said he was missing?
- No.

01:19.120 --> 01:21.246
It seemed like I called to chat.

01:21.498 --> 01:24.625
Pretty sure they both think I'm interested.

01:24.834 --> 01:27.294
- We've got to tell her.
- No, we can't.

01:27.545 --> 01:29.797
She'll start getting ready soon.

01:30.006 --> 01:34.301
Can't you stall her?
I'll go to the places I went last night.

01:34.511 --> 01:35.803
How much time?

01:36.012 --> 01:38.722
How long before she has to get ready?

01:38.932 --> 01:40.474
- One hour.
- Give me two.

01:40.683 --> 01:42.810
Then why do you ask?

01:44.187 --> 01:46.647
- Wish me luck.
- I'm going with you.

01:46.856 --> 01:48.398
Why?

01:48.608 --> 01:52.653
You're tired. You looked all night.
And clearly, you suck at this.

01:54.114 --> 01:55.114
See you later.

01:55.323 --> 01:57.074
Wait, do you know how
you're gonna stall her?

01:57.283 --> 02:00.577
- I'll figure something out.
- Okay, good luck.

02:03.206 --> 02:06.416
Let's start with my makeup
and then do my hair.

02:06.626 --> 02:10.503
Okay. But before you do that,
I need you to talk to me.

02:10.755 --> 02:12.506
About what?

02:14.717 --> 02:18.554
I'm never gonna get married.

02:18.763 --> 02:21.723
You will. The right guy's around the corner.

02:21.975 --> 02:24.184
Okay, are we done with that?

02:24.978 --> 02:26.687
No, I'm serious.

02:26.896 --> 02:32.151
Maybe I should just forget about it.
Become a lesbian or something.

02:32.360 --> 02:35.362
Any woman would be lucky to have you.

02:36.906 --> 02:39.783
Maybe I'd feel better if I slept with Joey.

02:39.993 --> 02:42.911
Rachel? Are you okay?

02:45.999 --> 02:51.003
Excuse me, Aaron? I have
a little problem with the schedule.

02:51.212 --> 02:56.049
I wasn't supposed to work today.
I have a wedding that I have to be at.

02:56.301 --> 02:59.136
It's my best friend's, and I'm officiating...

02:59.345 --> 03:01.305
...so I really can't work past 4.

03:01.556 --> 03:05.809
You've gotta stay until the end.
We can't stop filming just for you.

03:06.019 --> 03:08.770
It's not like it's your wedding.

03:08.980 --> 03:10.981
I'm having surgery.

03:12.192 --> 03:13.483
What?

03:13.693 --> 03:17.779
I made up the wedding,
because I didn't want you to worry.

03:18.031 --> 03:20.157
But I'm having surgery today.

03:20.366 --> 03:21.992
What kind of surgery?

03:22.911 --> 03:25.037
Transplant.

03:26.539 --> 03:28.790
You're supposed to work on Monday.

03:29.292 --> 03:31.960
Hair transplant.

03:32.420 --> 03:34.504
But you're not bald.

03:34.672 --> 03:36.882
It's not on my head.

03:40.345 --> 03:45.224
There's nothing I can do.
You'll probably be out by 4 anyway.

03:45.475 --> 03:49.895
We've got one scene. It's just you
and Richard, and he's a pro.

03:50.104 --> 03:52.189
You'll be fine.

03:52.732 --> 03:54.066
Morning, Richard.

03:54.317 --> 03:57.319
Hey, you're here. Great. Let's go, buddy.

03:57.570 --> 03:59.905
We got a scene to shoot.

04:00.823 --> 04:04.284
I'm wearing two belts.

04:06.704 --> 04:09.039
- Are you drunk?
- No.

04:09.249 --> 04:11.041
Yes, you are.

04:11.292 --> 04:12.834
All right.

04:16.755 --> 04:18.257
So this is your office?

04:18.466 --> 04:22.219
How'd you guys find me?
I knew I should've hid at the gym.

04:23.596 --> 04:26.306
- What the hell are you doing?
- Panicking.

04:26.516 --> 04:31.228
And using the Internet to try to prove
that I'm related to Monica.

04:33.273 --> 04:36.024
- How is she?
- She doesn't know you're gone.

04:36.234 --> 04:39.903
And she doesn't have to know.
Come on, we're going home.

04:40.113 --> 04:42.489
- I can't do that.
- Why not?

04:42.699 --> 04:45.867
If I go home, we're gonna become the Bings.

04:46.119 --> 04:47.828
I can't be the Bings.

04:48.079 --> 04:49.538
What's wrong with it?

04:49.747 --> 04:51.748
The Bings have bad marriages.

04:51.958 --> 04:54.668
They yell, fight, and use the pool boy...

04:54.919 --> 04:57.296
...as a pawn in their sexual games.

04:58.256 --> 05:03.093
Have you ever put on a black dress
and asked me up to your hotel room?

05:03.303 --> 05:07.597
- No.
- Then you are neither of your parents.

05:09.267 --> 05:13.645
It's not just their marriage.
Look at yours. Look at everybody's.

05:13.855 --> 05:16.898
Only Paul Newman can make marriage work.

05:17.108 --> 05:18.984
And I am no Paul Newman.

05:19.235 --> 05:24.197
I don't race cars or make popcorn.
None of my proceeds go to charity.

05:24.907 --> 05:26.283
But look, Chandler...

05:27.076 --> 05:31.413
...right now no one has
a lower opinion of you than I do.

05:33.249 --> 05:35.834
But I totally believe you can do this.

05:36.419 --> 05:40.047
I want to. I love her so much, but I'm afraid...

05:40.214 --> 05:42.257
Ahem. It's too huge.

05:42.508 --> 05:44.509
You're right. It is huge.

05:44.761 --> 05:48.263
So let's take it just a little bit at a time.

05:48.514 --> 05:51.600
Forget getting married for a sec.

05:51.809 --> 05:55.812
Can you just come home and take a shower?

05:56.022 --> 05:58.065
That's not scary, right?

05:58.274 --> 06:00.859
Depends on what you mean by "we."

06:02.904 --> 06:05.238
The nights are the hardest.

06:07.575 --> 06:09.701
But then the day comes...

06:09.952 --> 06:14.039
...and that's every bit as hard as the night.

06:14.248 --> 06:18.251
- Then the night comes...
- Days and nights are hard, I get it.

06:18.503 --> 06:22.422
I have to start getting ready.
I'm getting married today.

06:22.673 --> 06:25.425
I know. At dusk.

06:25.635 --> 06:28.345
That's such a hard time for me.

06:28.888 --> 06:32.557
I'm gonna put makeup on.
We have to be there in an hour.

06:32.809 --> 06:34.142
- Wait.
- What?

06:34.352 --> 06:36.561
Let's go to lunch.

06:36.771 --> 06:39.022
I can't go to lunch.

06:39.273 --> 06:40.982
Right.

06:43.236 --> 06:45.445
Oh, good God, I've fallen down.

06:47.907 --> 06:49.825
What's going on?

06:50.535 --> 06:51.993
Okay.

06:52.412 --> 06:54.121
All right, honey, listen.

06:55.498 --> 06:59.918
When I tell you what I'm
about to tell you, remember...

07:00.169 --> 07:03.713
...that we're all here for you,
and we love you.

07:03.923 --> 07:06.133
Okay, you're really freaking me out.

07:08.136 --> 07:10.470
We can't find Chandler...

07:11.764 --> 07:13.390
His vest.

07:14.142 --> 07:16.268
We can't find Chandler's vest.

07:16.477 --> 07:18.562
How can that be? Wait, are you serious?

07:20.898 --> 07:22.065
Found the vest.

07:22.275 --> 07:25.610
We'll have to keep an eye on it,
make sure we don't lose it again.

07:26.028 --> 07:27.237
Ah.

07:27.405 --> 07:31.116
Oh, wow. Okay, don't
scare me like that, okay?

07:31.325 --> 07:35.787
For a minute, I was like,
"Oh, my God. The worst has happened."

07:49.886 --> 07:51.720
So you two were married, huh?

07:53.890 --> 07:56.391
What happened, you just drift apart?

07:58.102 --> 08:00.770
Here comes the bride.

08:02.982 --> 08:06.443
Oh, my God, Monica.

08:06.861 --> 08:09.446
I want to wear this every day.

08:09.655 --> 08:11.698
You look so beautiful.

08:12.992 --> 08:14.784
I'm so happy for me.

08:18.831 --> 08:21.875
- Hello?
- Did Chandler show up yet?

08:22.084 --> 08:25.587
- We got him back. Everything's fine.
- Damn it.

08:25.796 --> 08:28.340
- Where are you?
- I'm still on the set.

08:28.549 --> 08:31.635
The wedding is in less than an hour.

08:31.844 --> 08:36.640
I'm sorry. The guy's drunk.
They won't let me go until we get it.

08:36.849 --> 08:40.434
Oh, my God. I'm gonna
have to find another minister.

08:40.645 --> 08:43.270
No, I'm the minister.

08:43.523 --> 08:47.609
Put them both on the phone
and I'll marry them right now.

08:47.860 --> 08:49.236
Joey, I have to go.

08:49.445 --> 08:53.114
Don't hang up on me. I'll marry you
and me right now. I have the power.

08:57.286 --> 09:00.497
There you go. You put on a tuxedo.

09:01.207 --> 09:03.124
That wasn't scary, was it?

09:03.834 --> 09:05.669
No.

09:05.878 --> 09:08.922
I'm telling you, just a little bit at a time.

09:09.423 --> 09:12.175
Okay. What's the next little bit?

09:12.426 --> 09:14.427
- Getting married.
- Oh, ah.

09:14.637 --> 09:19.558
You can do that too.
Just like you've done everything else.

09:21.394 --> 09:25.313
- Yeah, you're right. I can do that.
- Yeah.

09:25.481 --> 09:29.276
- Excuse me for a minute.
- Where you going?

09:29.527 --> 09:33.113
I'm not gonna run away.
I just want some fresh air.

09:33.656 --> 09:35.699
- Okay.
- Okay.

09:44.208 --> 09:46.751
Oh, fresh air.

09:48.588 --> 09:52.716
- Cover for me.
- Maybe you overreacted.

09:52.967 --> 09:54.718
We gotta do something.

09:54.969 --> 09:59.514
Joey won't make it,
so I'll look around for other weddings.

09:59.765 --> 10:04.269
Don't tell them Monica's pregnant,
because they frown on that.

10:04.437 --> 10:05.770
Okay.

10:16.991 --> 10:21.578
"Anastassakis Papasifakis wedding."
Excellent.

10:23.497 --> 10:25.415
Congratulations.

10:25.666 --> 10:27.584
Mazel tov.

10:27.835 --> 10:29.794
Hi. Oh, great hat.

10:31.130 --> 10:34.924
I need you to perform another wedding.
Can you do that?

10:35.134 --> 10:38.053
I don't know. Are they Greek Orthodox?

10:38.262 --> 10:39.846
Yeah. Yeah.

10:40.097 --> 10:44.601
They're my friends, Monica Stephanopolis.

10:44.852 --> 10:49.105
And Chandler Acidophilus.

10:53.444 --> 10:56.196
Hi. Hi.

10:57.740 --> 10:58.948
Hi.

11:02.078 --> 11:04.037
Has anyone seen Chandler?

11:04.246 --> 11:07.248
- I thought he was with you.
- He was with me.

11:07.500 --> 11:10.210
We're playing a game. Hide-and-seek.

11:10.419 --> 11:13.296
You can't ask us, son. That's cheating.

11:18.135 --> 11:21.805
You're right.
Thanks for keeping me honest, Dad.

11:22.014 --> 11:25.809
He can't come here and see
the bride in her wedding dress.

11:26.018 --> 11:30.313
When we got married,
I saw the groom in the wedding dress.

11:31.273 --> 11:34.651
That was after the wedding.
It's not bad luck then.

11:34.860 --> 11:37.028
Honey, it isn't good luck.

11:41.367 --> 11:44.494
Oh, my God. Monica.

11:44.704 --> 11:46.454
I know.

11:47.498 --> 11:50.917
- How's Chandler doing?
- Great.

11:51.127 --> 11:54.921
He's doing great.
Don't you worry about Chandler.

11:56.507 --> 12:00.009
- Phoebe, can I see you for a second?
- Yeah.

12:05.433 --> 12:07.809
- What's going on?
- Chandler's gone again.

12:08.060 --> 12:13.481
Why would you play hide-and-seek
with someone you know is a flight risk?

12:17.445 --> 12:20.989
Aaron, you gotta let me go.
The guy's hammered.

12:21.198 --> 12:26.119
I'm sorry. As long as he's here
and conscious, we're still shooting.

12:35.337 --> 12:39.257
You wouldn't happen to have
a very big fork?

12:40.843 --> 12:43.553
So I just talked to the director.

12:43.763 --> 12:46.598
That's it. We're done for the day.

12:47.558 --> 12:49.184
We finished the scene?

12:49.435 --> 12:54.063
- Yeah. You were wonderful.
- As were you.

12:54.899 --> 12:57.025
So I got your car. It's right outside.

12:57.234 --> 12:59.778
Thank you. You're welcome.

13:00.571 --> 13:04.574
No, we gotta go. Come on. Here we go.

13:06.076 --> 13:08.328
Is that my ass?

13:15.461 --> 13:17.337
- There he is!
- What?

13:18.130 --> 13:19.339
Hey! Whoa!

13:20.090 --> 13:22.175
You won't get away this time!

13:22.384 --> 13:25.553
Unless you want
that ass-kicking we talked about.

13:26.764 --> 13:29.057
- Ross.
- Hi-yah!

13:31.143 --> 13:34.813
I'm serious.
You're not walking out on my sister.

13:35.022 --> 13:36.731
That's right. I'm not.

13:36.982 --> 13:40.610
- Then where have you been?
- I know about Monica.

13:41.737 --> 13:43.780
- You know?
- What?

13:43.989 --> 13:47.283
- I heard you and Rachel talking.
- About what?

13:47.493 --> 13:48.618
You don't know?

13:48.828 --> 13:52.205
If somebody doesn't tell me right now...

13:52.414 --> 13:54.207
What, you'll "hi-yah"?

13:56.252 --> 13:58.086
Monica's pregnant.

13:59.922 --> 14:01.756
Oh, my God.

14:02.007 --> 14:05.635
Oh, my God. And you're not freaking out?

14:05.845 --> 14:09.806
I was. Then I went to
the gift shop for cigarettes.

14:10.015 --> 14:13.309
- Cigarettes?
- Big picture, please.

14:14.854 --> 14:19.232
So I was in the gift shop,
that's when I saw this...

14:20.943 --> 14:25.321
And I thought anything that can
fit into this can't be scary.

14:25.906 --> 14:29.409
You obviously didn't see Chuckie III.

14:30.077 --> 14:33.454
But come on, look at how cute
and small this is.

14:33.706 --> 14:38.459
So I got it to give Monica,
so she'd know I was okay.

14:38.669 --> 14:40.086
Dude.

14:40.671 --> 14:43.631
Way to go, son. I knew you'd find him.

14:52.975 --> 14:55.310
Our little boy is getting married.

14:55.519 --> 14:58.438
Look at you, so handsome.

14:58.647 --> 15:00.231
You look beautiful, Mom.

15:03.861 --> 15:06.362
You look beautiful too, Dad.

15:09.742 --> 15:11.784
I love you both.

15:12.077 --> 15:14.078
I'm so glad you're here.

15:20.044 --> 15:22.086
Are you Chandler?

15:22.338 --> 15:24.297
Are you Joey?

15:29.136 --> 15:32.221
- Huh. This is nice.
- What?

15:32.473 --> 15:37.018
I've never walked down the aisle
knowing it can't end in divorce.

15:52.743 --> 15:56.204
I wish your grandmother
had lived to see this.

15:56.413 --> 16:00.792
- She's right there.
- Not that old crone. My mother.

16:04.296 --> 16:06.631
Congratulations, darling.

16:06.882 --> 16:08.925
We love you, sweetheart.

16:12.930 --> 16:14.973
You look beautiful.

16:15.724 --> 16:18.309
- Is this new?
- Not now.

16:22.648 --> 16:25.149
- Who's this?
- I'm Father Karabasos.

16:25.359 --> 16:27.151
He's Greek Orthodox.

16:27.361 --> 16:29.779
As are you.

16:31.949 --> 16:33.574
Let us begin.

16:34.702 --> 16:35.952
Dearly beloved...

16:36.161 --> 16:38.121
That's my line.

16:42.918 --> 16:45.503
I can take it from here. Thanks.

16:47.548 --> 16:51.467
Dearly beloved, I'm sorry I'm a little late.

16:54.013 --> 16:56.889
You may be confused by this now...

16:57.141 --> 17:01.060
...but you won't be
Memorial Day weekend, 2002.

17:03.856 --> 17:07.567
Let's get started before
the groom takes off again.

17:13.949 --> 17:16.492
We are gathered here today...

17:16.702 --> 17:19.203
...to join this man...

17:19.413 --> 17:23.790
...and this woman
in the bonds of holy matrimony.

17:24.626 --> 17:28.838
I've known Monica and Chandler
for a long time, and I can't...

17:29.089 --> 17:33.760
...imagine two people more perfect
for each other.

17:36.263 --> 17:41.309
And now, as I've left my notes
in my dressing room...

17:42.061 --> 17:45.688
...we shall proceed to the vows. Monica?

17:46.815 --> 17:50.068
- He took off?
- Go on. Go on.

17:55.449 --> 17:59.452
Chandler, for so long...

17:59.870 --> 18:03.623
...I wondered if I would ever find my prince.

18:03.874 --> 18:05.792
My soul mate.

18:06.001 --> 18:08.836
Then three years ago, at another wedding...

18:09.088 --> 18:11.672
...I turned to a friend for comfort.

18:11.924 --> 18:17.136
And instead, I found everything that
I'd been looking for my whole life.

18:19.932 --> 18:21.766
And now...

18:22.851 --> 18:24.685
...here we are...

18:25.562 --> 18:28.022
...with our future before us.

18:29.274 --> 18:31.984
And I only want to spend it with you.

18:33.320 --> 18:37.406
My prince. My soul mate.

18:37.616 --> 18:39.700
My friend.

18:42.496 --> 18:44.914
Unless you don't want to.

18:47.292 --> 18:48.876
You go.

18:50.295 --> 18:51.337
Chandler?

18:52.506 --> 18:54.715
No, that's okay.

18:58.971 --> 19:03.474
I thought this would be the most
difficult thing I ever had to do.

19:05.018 --> 19:09.522
But when I saw you walking down that aisle,
I realized it's simple.

19:12.151 --> 19:13.442
I love you.

19:15.362 --> 19:20.575
Any surprises that come our way,
it's okay, because I will always love you.

19:22.786 --> 19:27.039
You are the person I was meant
to spend the rest of my life with.

19:27.291 --> 19:29.542
You want to know if I'm sure?

19:33.046 --> 19:35.965
You may now kiss the bride.

19:38.010 --> 19:39.510
So...

19:39.678 --> 19:43.431
I guess by the powers vested in me
by the State of New York...

19:43.682 --> 19:46.142
...and the Internet guys...

19:48.437 --> 19:52.481
...I now pronounce you husband and wife.

19:52.900 --> 19:55.735
Oh, wait. Do you take each other?

19:55.944 --> 19:58.237
- I do.
- I do.

19:58.447 --> 20:00.031
Yeah, you do.

20:01.408 --> 20:02.617
Rings?

20:02.826 --> 20:04.577
Oh, crap.

20:06.371 --> 20:08.122
Let's do the rings.

20:19.343 --> 20:21.886
We good? Yeah? Good?

20:23.138 --> 20:24.847
Once again...

20:25.098 --> 20:28.643
...I pronounce you husband and wife.

20:28.894 --> 20:31.062
Now kiss her again.

20:46.245 --> 20:47.954
I love you.

20:48.205 --> 20:50.331
And I know about the baby.

20:51.208 --> 20:53.251
- What baby?
- Our baby.

20:53.460 --> 20:55.211
We have a baby?

20:56.797 --> 20:59.215
Phoebe found your pregnancy test.

20:59.424 --> 21:01.592
I didn't take a pregnancy test.

21:01.802 --> 21:03.636
Then who did?

21:04.388 --> 21:06.931
Look at them.

21:07.182 --> 21:10.059
And they're gonna have a baby.

21:11.687 --> 21:13.479
Uh-huh.
