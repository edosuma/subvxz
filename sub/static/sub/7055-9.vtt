WEBVTT

00:01.231 --> 00:02.632
Previously on <i>Fringe...</i>

00:02.699 --> 00:04.295
I think the machine is my
best chance of getting home,

00:05.551 --> 00:07.558
and Walter is not gonna
help me recalibrate it,

00:07.559 --> 00:08.885
so I'm hoping
that Walternate will.

00:08.886 --> 00:12.518
I need to cross over
into the alternate universe.

00:12.605 --> 00:13.970
Put your hands
behind your head.

00:14.318 --> 00:15.868
Don't move!

00:15.936 --> 00:17.270
Our universe
has been infiltrated

00:17.321 --> 00:18.905
by shape-shifters
from your side,

00:18.956 --> 00:20.439
and your Defense Secretary
is behind them.

00:20.491 --> 00:22.125
<i>We'll sort it out</i>
<i>at headquarters.</i>

00:22.209 --> 00:24.110
Nobody knows
you're here but us.

00:24.161 --> 00:25.461
Secretary Bishop,

00:25.546 --> 00:27.497
I came here because I needed
your help to get home.

00:27.581 --> 00:31.251
And I will do
everything in my power,

00:31.302 --> 00:34.170
but you must go back
to the other side and tell them

00:34.255 --> 00:36.506
whoever's behind this
is a threat to us all.

00:36.573 --> 00:38.258
We're chasing the story
of a suspect

00:38.309 --> 00:39.259
locked in a broom closet.

00:39.310 --> 00:40.260
What if he's right?

00:40.311 --> 00:41.460
What if he's not?

00:41.512 --> 00:45.265
We have to tell
Broyles something.

00:45.316 --> 00:47.567
They're on their way
to you now.

00:47.634 --> 00:49.852
We'll be waiting for them.

00:53.857 --> 00:55.825
I'm telling you,
you're making a mistake.

00:55.909 --> 00:57.860
Your Defense Secretary
is covering his tracks.

00:57.945 --> 00:59.195
He has been
inside your divi--

01:01.000 --> 01:07.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:10.184 --> 02:12.218
Colonel Broyles.

02:12.269 --> 02:13.886
Mr. Secretary.

02:13.937 --> 02:15.772
What are you
doing here, sir?

02:15.856 --> 02:17.990
I understand
you have a detainee--

02:18.058 --> 02:20.276
Agent Lincoln Lee
from the other side.

02:20.361 --> 02:22.111
That's right.

02:22.196 --> 02:23.363
Who's this?

02:23.414 --> 02:25.698
Please see that Agent Lee
is released immediately.

02:25.749 --> 02:27.583
As far as the rest...

02:27.668 --> 02:30.536
Well, perhaps best
I explain in private.

02:31.905 --> 02:33.289
Shape-shifters?

02:33.374 --> 02:34.573
You're certain
about this?

02:34.625 --> 02:36.459
I wouldn't be here
if I weren't.

02:36.543 --> 02:39.212
And if the Department of Defense
can be infiltrated,

02:39.263 --> 02:43.082
then clearly every branch
of our government is vulnerable.

02:43.133 --> 02:44.467
You're suggesting
that Fringe--

02:44.551 --> 02:46.386
We have reason to believe
that your Agent Murphy

02:46.437 --> 02:48.354
may have been one of them.

02:48.422 --> 02:51.590
We'll know for sure
as soon as he's autopsied.

02:51.642 --> 02:53.592
Do we have any idea
who they're answering to?

02:53.644 --> 02:54.777
No.

02:54.862 --> 02:57.397
Nor do we understand
their end...

02:57.448 --> 02:59.866
What their agenda is.

03:01.568 --> 03:03.319
We might know more soon.

03:03.404 --> 03:04.937
Agents Lee and Dunham
ran a trace

03:04.988 --> 03:06.406
on Murphy's
last phone call.

03:06.457 --> 03:09.075
They're following up
as we speak.

03:21.788 --> 03:23.005
I don't know.

03:23.090 --> 03:24.807
I've known Murphy
since the Academy.

03:24.892 --> 03:26.175
He's always been
a straight arrow.

03:26.260 --> 03:27.510
Oh, I just got
kind of a hunch

03:27.594 --> 03:29.645
that this other Lincoln's
telling us the truth.

03:29.730 --> 03:32.231
Must be because he has
such a trustworthy face.

03:33.633 --> 03:35.318
See, I think
he's kind of funny-looking.

03:35.402 --> 03:38.271
You're funny-looking.

03:59.209 --> 04:01.160
Don't move.

04:01.211 --> 04:03.012
Put your hands up.

04:05.165 --> 04:08.634
Do you know
what she is?

04:08.685 --> 04:10.136
A shape-shifter.

04:10.187 --> 04:12.355
She was once just
a human being

04:12.439 --> 04:13.672
like any other.

04:13.724 --> 04:15.057
Until you killed her.

04:15.142 --> 04:17.192
Oh, she's not dead.

04:17.277 --> 04:18.194
Though
in a manner of speaking,

04:18.278 --> 04:19.845
she was.

04:19.897 --> 04:22.348
A bookkeeper
for an accounting firm--

04:22.399 --> 04:25.535
can you imagine anything
more lifeless?

04:25.619 --> 04:28.287
I suppose
this is what is feels like

04:28.355 --> 04:31.040
to have a child...

04:31.124 --> 04:34.026
To love
as a parent does.

04:34.077 --> 04:35.694
You must be very proud.

04:38.081 --> 04:40.216
Oh, I am...

04:40.300 --> 04:41.834
<i>Of all of them.</i>

04:41.885 --> 04:44.086
<i>47 so far.</i>

04:44.171 --> 04:46.205
And each one...

04:46.256 --> 04:47.974
Perfect.

04:49.560 --> 04:50.893
I'm so sorry.

04:50.978 --> 04:53.879
What are you doing to it?

04:53.931 --> 04:56.265
To <i>her!</i>

04:56.350 --> 04:57.883
Isn't it obvious.

05:01.905 --> 05:03.222
Now I'm killing her.

05:14.284 --> 05:16.285
Why'd you do that?

05:20.907 --> 05:23.843
<i>Because you don't know me</i>
<i>or what I'm capable of.</i>

05:23.910 --> 05:28.548
But if I'm willing to do that
to someone I love dearly,

05:28.599 --> 05:33.436
imagine what I'll do to people
I don't care about.

05:35.422 --> 05:37.607
And what is it you need?
<i>From you?</i>

05:37.674 --> 05:39.609
Nothing.

05:39.693 --> 05:42.428
You don't have
the authority.

05:46.700 --> 05:49.485
Take me to your leader.

Ah!
Agent...Dunham.

Hey.

Look...

06:35.763 --> 06:38.831
Spherical pastrami.

06:38.882 --> 06:40.183

Uh...

06:40.267 --> 06:41.851
No.
Thank you.

06:41.935 --> 06:43.436
Um, I was looking
for Astrid.

06:43.503 --> 06:44.687
<i>Hey.</i>

06:44.772 --> 06:48.057
Walter's just discovered
molecular gastronomy.

06:48.142 --> 06:49.392
I liquefied the meat,

06:49.476 --> 06:51.677
then placed it
in an alginate bath.

06:51.728 --> 06:52.812
It's--it's really quite...

06:52.863 --> 06:55.698
Disgusting.

06:55.783 --> 06:58.484
That's the thing
about scientific inquiry--

06:58.535 --> 07:01.954
not every experiment
is a success.

07:05.576 --> 07:09.796
But I hold high hopes
for the parmesan ice cream.

07:09.863 --> 07:12.665
You've had a fun day?

07:12.716 --> 07:15.051
The best.

07:15.135 --> 07:16.803
What's up?

07:16.870 --> 07:19.088
I was hoping you could do
something for me.

07:19.173 --> 07:22.008
Uh, could you check
this blood sample

07:22.059 --> 07:24.477
against the national
and international databases?

07:24.544 --> 07:26.479
Am I looking for anything
in particular?

07:26.546 --> 07:27.897
I don't know--
a name, a genetic marker,

07:27.981 --> 07:29.932
anything
out of the ordinary.

07:31.852 --> 07:33.486
What's going on?

07:33.553 --> 07:35.238
You seem troubled.

07:37.524 --> 07:38.825
I helped Peter and Lincoln

07:38.892 --> 07:40.860
cross over
to the other universe.

07:40.911 --> 07:43.496
Since Walter's refusing
to help Peter get back

07:43.563 --> 07:44.914
to where he's from,

07:44.998 --> 07:47.500
he thinks that Walternate
may help him.

07:47.567 --> 07:49.585
And Lincoln's doing recon
on the shape-shifters.

07:49.670 --> 07:51.737
Whoa.

07:51.788 --> 07:54.006
And what does that have to do
with the blood sample?

07:54.074 --> 07:55.591
Probably nothing,
but can you call me

07:55.676 --> 07:56.843
if you find anything?

07:56.910 --> 07:58.427
- Mm.
- And wish me luck.

07:58.512 --> 08:01.080
Where are you going?
Why do you need luck?

08:02.766 --> 08:04.684
Because Broyles doesn't know
anything about this, does he?

08:04.751 --> 08:06.435
And Peter and Lincoln
should have been back by now,

08:06.520 --> 08:08.420
so I'm gonna have to go and
tell him what's been going on.

08:08.472 --> 08:11.274
Good luck.

08:28.275 --> 08:29.314
What do we know?

08:29.315 --> 08:30.783
That he is certifiable.

08:30.834 --> 08:32.451
Apart from that,
nothing else.

08:32.501 --> 08:34.086
- I.D.?
<i>- We didn't find a show-me--</i>

08:34.153 --> 08:35.287
<i>no surprise there.</i>

08:35.337 --> 08:37.339
We ran his biometrics
through all the databases--

08:37.424 --> 08:39.658
<i>criminal, medical,</i>
<i>insurance.</i>

08:39.708 --> 08:42.177
<i>Based on his accent, we even</i>
<i>reached out to Scotland Yard.</i>

08:42.261 --> 08:44.346
<i>So far, nothing.</i>
- Anything at the location?

08:44.431 --> 08:46.548
Cleared it out
before we got there.

08:46.633 --> 08:48.100
Science Division's
doing a sweep.

08:48.167 --> 08:49.184
He knew we were coming.

08:49.269 --> 08:50.853
I mean, he was waiting
for us to show up.

08:50.937 --> 08:52.838
Take him to interrogation.
I'll meet you there.

08:52.889 --> 08:55.224
And this time
use an actual room,

08:55.308 --> 08:57.676
not the maintenance closet.

08:57.727 --> 08:59.678
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.

09:05.535 --> 09:07.202
Thanks.

09:07.287 --> 09:09.521
You hear they're bringing up
the suspect?

09:09.572 --> 09:10.739
What suspect?

09:10.790 --> 09:12.958
The guy who's behind
trying to have us killed,

09:13.025 --> 09:14.460
the guy behind
the shape-shifters.

09:14.527 --> 09:16.795
Sir, your escort
should be here shortly.

09:16.863 --> 09:18.497
Thank you.

09:18.548 --> 09:19.548
What escort?

09:19.632 --> 09:20.799
We're leaving.

09:22.302 --> 09:24.720
Wait a minute--we might
finally get some answers.

09:24.804 --> 09:26.472
We should stay here,
and we should assist

09:26.539 --> 09:28.557
- with the interrogation.
- - No.

09:28.641 --> 09:30.058
I finally got Walternate
to agree to help me.

09:30.143 --> 09:31.143
I don't think the way
to say thank you

09:31.210 --> 09:32.394
is to tell him
how to do his job.

09:32.479 --> 09:33.879
So that's it.
Yeah, you...

09:33.930 --> 09:36.381
- You got what you wanted.
- Yes, I got what I wanted.

09:36.432 --> 09:38.400
And whatever he finds out
in that interrogation

09:38.485 --> 09:39.718
he's gonna share with you.

09:39.769 --> 09:41.320
So you got
what you came for.

09:41.387 --> 09:42.934
And now all I want to do
is get back to the other side,

09:42.935 --> 09:43.849
study the blueprints--

09:43.874 --> 09:45.584
I need to be a part
of this investigation.

09:45.658 --> 09:46.909
I lost partner.

09:46.993 --> 09:49.077
I lost a universe!

09:54.617 --> 09:56.668
You're scared.
Yes, I am scared.

09:56.736 --> 09:58.236
I'm scared that every day
that I stay here

09:58.288 --> 09:59.404
the people that I love

09:59.455 --> 10:00.839
get farther and farther
away from me.

10:00.907 --> 10:03.091
So let them do their jobs.

10:03.176 --> 10:04.927
There's nothing
that you can do here

10:05.011 --> 10:06.578
<i>that they can't do</i>
<i>for themselves.</i>

10:06.629 --> 10:08.180
Is the interrogation
room ready?

10:08.247 --> 10:10.299
What is it?

10:13.636 --> 10:15.220
You know that guy?

10:18.124 --> 10:20.592
I'm Colonel Broyles.

10:20.660 --> 10:22.294
I'd like to ask you
some questions.

10:22.362 --> 10:25.280
I'm sure you have
an abundance of questions.

10:25.365 --> 10:28.266
<i>But I doubt</i>
<i>I'd answer any of them.</i>

10:28.318 --> 10:32.103
Besides which,
we don't have much time.

10:32.155 --> 10:37.793
I imagine you'd like
to avoid unnecessary deaths.

10:37.877 --> 10:41.580
We're not in the business
of responding to threats.

10:41.631 --> 10:43.765
Oh, I wouldn't call
it that.

10:43.833 --> 10:46.802
Consider it an...

10:46.886 --> 10:49.922
Insurance policy.

10:51.724 --> 10:53.225
An Agent of mine--

10:53.292 --> 10:56.294
a shape-shifter posing
as Dr. Brandon Fayette--

10:56.346 --> 10:58.647
was taken off-line
earlier today.

10:58.731 --> 11:00.682
<i>In his office,</i>
<i>above his desk,</i>

11:00.767 --> 11:02.651
<i>there is a light fixture.</i>

11:02.735 --> 11:04.636
<i>Remove the outer frame.</i>

11:04.687 --> 11:08.306
Tucked inside,
there is a hard drive

11:08.358 --> 11:12.277
you have 12 minutes
to bring it to me.

11:12.328 --> 11:14.279
- 12?
- Not to worry.

11:14.347 --> 11:17.315
I've been assured that
by helicopter,

11:17.367 --> 11:19.835
you can make it
to the D.O.D. and back

11:19.919 --> 11:23.755
with two minutes to spare.

11:23.823 --> 11:25.156
<i>And what's on the hard drive?</i>

11:25.208 --> 11:26.508
Go.

11:26.593 --> 11:27.709
We'll call
on our way back.

11:27.794 --> 11:29.494
<i>Nothing of interest to you,</i>

11:29.545 --> 11:32.931
though I'm sure you'll
copy the contents

11:32.999 --> 11:35.183
before you let me go.

11:36.669 --> 11:38.169
Before we let you go?

11:38.221 --> 11:39.721
Of course.

11:39.806 --> 11:41.523
Anything else you want
while we're at it?

11:41.608 --> 11:44.109
Um...

11:44.176 --> 11:47.178
I wouldn't mind
a cup of tea.

11:58.574 --> 12:01.627
I imagined you'd be
on your way back home.

12:03.997 --> 12:07.616
I know who that man is.

12:07.684 --> 12:11.553
<i>His name</i>
<i>is David Robert Jones.</i>

12:11.638 --> 12:12.754
Go on.

12:12.839 --> 12:13.922
He's a scientist.

12:14.007 --> 12:15.507
He has a background
in biotechnology

12:15.558 --> 12:17.092
<i>and genetic weaponry.</i>

12:17.176 --> 12:18.660
If you're right, we'll have
a record of him--we don't.

12:18.728 --> 12:19.978
<i>He's not in any database.</i>

12:20.046 --> 12:21.430
Because he's not
from your universe.

12:21.514 --> 12:25.317
<i>He crossed over</i>
<i>from the other side.</i>

12:26.519 --> 12:28.737
How can you be so certain?

12:28.821 --> 12:32.891
You've already that things are
different from your timeline.

12:32.942 --> 12:34.943
Let me talk to him.

12:35.028 --> 12:36.828
Sir, I hardly think
that's wise.

12:57.266 --> 13:00.052
Do you have my tea?

13:00.103 --> 13:02.804
Hardly.

13:07.276 --> 13:10.062
I do have some questions
I'd like to ask you, though.

13:10.113 --> 13:13.648
Funny...
The last man in here

13:13.733 --> 13:15.283
said the same thing.

13:18.037 --> 13:19.571
You're not from here,
are you?

13:19.622 --> 13:23.241
Did the accent give it away?

13:24.443 --> 13:25.577
No.

13:25.628 --> 13:30.248
Actually,
it was the scars.

13:30.299 --> 13:31.583
Did you see that?

13:31.634 --> 13:33.301
His pulse just went up.

13:33.386 --> 13:34.753
<i>The last time I saw you,</i>

13:34.821 --> 13:36.254
you were completely
falling apart--

13:36.305 --> 13:38.306
molecular disintegration

13:38.391 --> 13:40.458
due to transporting
out of a German prison.

13:40.510 --> 13:42.627
They had to wrap you
in bandages

13:42.678 --> 13:46.148
just keep you from turning
into a puddle on the floor.

13:46.232 --> 13:49.901
It seems like you figured out
a way to heal yourself.

13:49.969 --> 13:51.186
Do you mind if I ask?

13:51.270 --> 13:53.522
What was it--
some sort of...

13:53.606 --> 13:54.856
DNA graft?

13:56.776 --> 13:59.528
I've never met you
in my life.

14:01.313 --> 14:02.748
No.

14:02.815 --> 14:05.033
But I've met you.

14:07.653 --> 14:09.921
Where?

14:11.457 --> 14:13.108
When you were crossing
out of your universe

14:13.176 --> 14:15.010
into this one.

14:15.094 --> 14:18.647
<i>You created</i>
<i>a-a doorway, a portal.</i>

14:18.714 --> 14:21.049
<i>I'm the man</i>
<i>who closed it on you.</i>

14:21.117 --> 14:25.170
It cut you right in half.

14:30.226 --> 14:32.510
Interesting story.

14:32.562 --> 14:37.332
Yet I'm still
in one piece.

14:37.400 --> 14:42.270
I believe
you've run out of time.

14:46.542 --> 14:47.909
This is Broyles.

14:47.994 --> 14:49.360
<i>Sir, I have</i>
<i>a woman on the line</i>

14:49.412 --> 14:50.712
<i>who says you're</i>
<i>expecting her call.</i>

14:50.797 --> 14:53.248
<i>She says she's a friend</i>
<i>of Mr. Jones.</i>

14:54.884 --> 14:56.701
Go ahead.

14:56.752 --> 14:59.838
<i>Is Secretary Bishop</i>
<i>on the line too?</i>

14:59.889 --> 15:01.006
Who is this?

15:01.057 --> 15:03.058
Can Mr. Jones
hear me as well?

15:05.945 --> 15:08.230
<i>He can.</i>

15:08.314 --> 15:10.098
<i>What do you want?</i>

15:10.183 --> 15:11.516
Just for you to listen.

15:17.389 --> 15:19.390
Dr. Samuels, do you want me
to give that little girl

15:19.442 --> 15:20.892
with the bike injury
a tetanus?

15:20.943 --> 15:21.910
Not necessary.

15:21.994 --> 15:23.528
I don't think
she's gonna make it.

15:29.035 --> 15:30.902
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

15:36.425 --> 15:38.910
Help! Help!

15:38.961 --> 15:40.428
<i>Help! Let me out of here!</i>

16:10.960 --> 16:13.262
Yes?

16:15.098 --> 16:16.798
Uh, sir,
can I speak to you?

16:16.849 --> 16:18.634
Is this about Peter
and Agent Lee?

16:18.685 --> 16:20.686
You know?

16:22.221 --> 16:24.339
That you helped them
cross over to the other side

16:24.390 --> 16:25.607
<i>without my authorization?</i>

16:25.675 --> 16:27.025
<i>Yes, I know.</i>

16:27.110 --> 16:29.227
I've just received word
from my alter ego.

16:29.312 --> 16:31.313
Needless to say,
he was about as amused as I am.

16:31.381 --> 16:33.532
- Are they okay?
<i>- They're fine.</i>

16:33.616 --> 16:35.984
And we'll deal with the issue
of your insubordination

16:36.035 --> 16:37.469
once we've resolved
the situation.

16:37.537 --> 16:39.288
What situation?

16:39.355 --> 16:41.540
Take a seat.

16:44.294 --> 16:46.995
Have you ever heard of a man
named David Robert Jones?

16:47.046 --> 16:48.497
- No.
<i>- Neither had I.</i>

16:48.548 --> 16:49.748
<i>He's been</i>
<i>in Frankfurt prison</i>

16:49.832 --> 16:51.667
<i>for possession</i>
<i>of state secrets.</i>

16:51.718 --> 16:52.968
<i>Three years ago,</i>
<i>he broke out.</i>

16:53.035 --> 16:54.136
Apparently, since then,

16:54.203 --> 16:56.004
he's made his way
to the other side.

17:07.750 --> 17:09.451
<i>There were 16 people</i>
<i>in the E.R.--</i>

17:09.519 --> 17:10.736
all of them dead.

17:10.819 --> 17:13.188
And he says, if he's not
released within 14 minutes,

17:13.239 --> 17:15.857
then next attack
will be worse.

17:15.925 --> 17:18.443
What do you want
to do, sir?

17:20.445 --> 17:22.731
- Prepare him for release.
<i>- What?</i>

17:22.781 --> 17:24.232
You can't be serious.

17:28.338 --> 17:30.572
I understand
your concerns, Agent.

17:30.623 --> 17:33.074
<i>I can't in good conscience</i>

17:33.126 --> 17:36.578
allow him to continue
to attack civilian targets.

17:36.646 --> 17:38.096
And you think capitulating
is going to make him

17:38.181 --> 17:39.798
any less dangerous?

17:39.882 --> 17:41.767
<i>Tell them.</i>

17:41.851 --> 17:43.101
<i>Tell them this</i>
<i>is a terrible idea.</i>

17:43.186 --> 17:44.386
What idea?

17:44.437 --> 17:45.771
They're gonna let Jones
just walk right out of here.

17:45.855 --> 17:47.723
Do we even know
what's on the hard disk?

17:47.774 --> 17:49.924
Apparently, he was accessing
government satellites.

17:49.976 --> 17:51.593
Astrid's reviewing
the data now.

17:51.644 --> 17:53.445
<i>Obviously,</i>
<i>we'll be keeping him</i>

17:53.529 --> 17:56.231
under constant surveillance.

17:56.282 --> 17:58.617
This situation may even play out
to our advantage.

17:58.701 --> 18:01.403
<i>We may learn</i>
<i>who he's working with,</i>

18:01.454 --> 18:03.271
where the other
shape-shifters are.

18:03.322 --> 18:05.607
We can monitor him
with an internal tracker.

18:07.109 --> 18:08.660
- That's a good idea.
<i>- I'm glad you like it.</i>

18:08.745 --> 18:11.863
I put one in his tea.

18:14.884 --> 18:16.785
<i>Agent Lee, Dunham...</i>

18:16.836 --> 18:19.137
Start organizing
the surveillance detail.

18:19.222 --> 18:22.340
I'd like to help...
If that's okay with you.

18:23.509 --> 18:24.559
Any objections?

18:26.179 --> 18:27.229
None.

19:06.302 --> 19:08.854
Much better,
thank you.

19:08.938 --> 19:10.722
The hard drive, please.

19:18.114 --> 19:20.816
It's been a pleasure.

20:01.691 --> 20:03.275
<i>Hey, Red, you got anything?</i>

20:03.359 --> 20:05.443
Uh, yeah.
I mean, same as you.

20:05.528 --> 20:07.913
<i>I'm looking at a guy</i>
<i>who knows he's being watched.</i>

20:07.997 --> 20:09.865
<i>He's gonna make a move</i>
<i>soon, though.</i>

20:09.916 --> 20:11.082
<i>Check your watch.</i>

20:11.167 --> 20:13.285
<i>He's waiting</i>
<i>for the lunch crowd.</i>

20:13.369 --> 20:14.402
<i>He's gonna try</i>
<i>and get lost.</i>

20:14.453 --> 20:16.538
I'll be waiting.

20:18.207 --> 20:20.375
So you two seem close.

20:20.426 --> 20:22.544
Yeah, we are.

20:24.213 --> 20:25.964
Oh, no, no.

20:26.048 --> 20:27.799
No, I mean, not--

20:27.884 --> 20:29.601
<i>just as partners.</i>

20:29.685 --> 20:31.303
You don't have
to say it like that,

20:31.387 --> 20:33.054
like you pity us.

20:33.105 --> 20:34.723
No, I just
broke up with someone,

20:34.774 --> 20:37.726
and Lincoln's been
my shoulder to cry on.

20:44.016 --> 20:46.484
<i>He just got up.</i>

20:49.038 --> 20:50.705
What's he doing?

20:51.941 --> 20:54.326
I'm guessing
that's not lunch.

20:54.410 --> 20:55.710
<i>All units be advised--</i>

20:55.778 --> 20:56.711
<i>suspect removed</i>

20:56.779 --> 20:58.163
some kind of thermos
from the trash.

20:58.247 --> 21:00.498
Place Hazmat and E.O.D.
personnel on standby.

21:06.255 --> 21:08.223
Hello.

21:08.290 --> 21:10.058
Would you like some money?

21:10.125 --> 21:12.227
- For real?
- Oh, yes.

21:12.294 --> 21:15.513
But I need your help
giving away all of it.

21:15.581 --> 21:17.232
You see, I've realized

21:17.299 --> 21:19.067
that there's
no point being...

21:19.134 --> 21:21.736
The richest man
in the cemetery.

21:22.738 --> 21:24.739
Huh.
All right.

21:24.807 --> 21:27.442
This guy's giving out
free money!

21:31.247 --> 21:32.981
Are you seeing this?

21:33.049 --> 21:35.083
Yeah, I see it.
What the hell's he up to?

21:40.756 --> 21:42.374
Oh, no.

21:42.458 --> 21:45.043
Colonel Broyles...
We have a problem.

21:45.127 --> 21:47.161
- What is it?
<i>- The tracking software--</i>

21:47.213 --> 21:48.263
<i>there's some sort</i>
<i>of malfunction.</i>

21:48.330 --> 21:50.932
Jones's tracking signal
is multiplying.

21:51.000 --> 21:52.801
We're seeing 40 or 50 dots
and counting.

21:54.169 --> 21:55.270
It's the money.

21:55.337 --> 21:56.438
He knows he's being tracked.

21:56.505 --> 21:58.840
- He's put trackers on the money.
- What?

21:58.891 --> 22:01.443
How the hell did he know
what signal we're using?

22:01.510 --> 22:03.228
Damn it.

22:03.312 --> 22:05.013
All units,
move into the Plaza

22:05.064 --> 22:06.898
and maintain a visual
on the target.

22:06.983 --> 22:08.867
Excuse me!
Fringe Division!

22:18.744 --> 22:19.746
<i>Astrid, is there any way</i>

22:19.771 --> 22:20.971
<i>you can zero in on Jones?</i>

22:21.047 --> 22:22.831
I don't know
which signal is his.

22:25.367 --> 22:26.751
I don't see him.

22:29.538 --> 22:30.555
Okay, I think I got him.

22:30.640 --> 22:31.973
There's a new cluster
of trackers

22:32.041 --> 22:33.892
forming by the fountain
north of the Plaza.

22:44.737 --> 22:46.688
Damn it.
It just disappeared.

23:10.796 --> 23:12.881
<i>Colonel Broyles, we lost him.</i>

23:12.932 --> 23:14.916
Roger that.

23:14.967 --> 23:18.353
All personnel
return to Fringe Division.

23:26.926 --> 23:31.180
♪

23:31.231 --> 23:34.600
Walter, I know whatever happened
today was a setback.

23:36.886 --> 23:39.655
There's more than that.

23:39.722 --> 23:41.990
We were
severely compromised.

23:42.058 --> 23:44.359
Another, please.

23:44.410 --> 23:46.662
And more scotch
is gonna change that?

23:51.400 --> 23:53.118
It was my decision,
Elizabeth.

23:53.203 --> 23:56.038
I knew the risk.

23:56.105 --> 23:58.941
I took a--
an immense gamble.

23:59.008 --> 24:02.410
And now
that man Jones is gone.

24:10.086 --> 24:12.304
I don't think that's
all you're upset about.

24:14.357 --> 24:16.591
You've gone over
the blueprints, haven't you?

24:16.643 --> 24:18.360
Like Peter asked you to.

24:21.397 --> 24:22.948
Yes.

24:23.032 --> 24:25.918
I've tried to see
what he's saying...

24:25.985 --> 24:28.820
That the machine is...

24:28.905 --> 24:31.456
capable of more
than one function,

24:31.541 --> 24:34.876
that it can return him
to his timeline.

24:34.944 --> 24:37.112
<i>But I can't help him.</i>

24:37.163 --> 24:39.831
<i>And apparently,</i>
<i>the other Walter refuses to...</i>

24:44.304 --> 24:45.837
Which is...

24:45.922 --> 24:47.256
Ironic,

24:47.307 --> 24:50.592
given the lengths that
that man went to in the past.

24:52.095 --> 24:54.096
That is not your fault.

24:54.147 --> 24:55.764
It never was.

24:58.568 --> 25:01.853
Well, the outcome
is still the same.

25:04.307 --> 25:07.109
<i>I couldn't save</i>
<i>our son then.</i>

25:09.478 --> 25:12.447
And I can't help him now.

25:18.454 --> 25:20.488
Maybe I can.

25:24.127 --> 25:27.479
Maybe I can help Peter.

25:27.547 --> 25:30.632
<i>These are all the files</i>
<i>we got from the hard drive.</i>

25:30.683 --> 25:33.018
It seems Mr. Jones
was using D.O.D satellite

25:33.102 --> 25:34.553
and ground-penetrating radar

25:34.637 --> 25:36.438
to gather geological
information.

25:36.505 --> 25:38.440
So he's looking
for something underground.

25:38.507 --> 25:41.643
What's there--
minerals, oil deposits?

25:41.694 --> 25:43.011
Nothing of obvious value.

25:43.062 --> 25:44.730
I've cross-referenced
the subfolders

25:44.814 --> 25:47.065
to see which locations
they researched the most,

25:47.150 --> 25:49.318
but so far, I haven't found
any meaningful pattern.

25:49.369 --> 25:50.736
Let me know if you do.

25:50.820 --> 25:53.155
Yes, sir.

25:53.206 --> 25:56.708
Do you mind if I take a look
at your list of locations?

25:56.793 --> 25:58.360
I don't mind.

26:01.497 --> 26:05.584
Are you really
from another timeline?

26:05.668 --> 26:07.719
Yeah, I think so.

26:08.755 --> 26:11.206
Cool.

26:12.558 --> 26:13.892
Hey, Lincoln, it's me.

26:13.976 --> 26:16.645
We're uploading Jones'
face-recognition profile

26:16.712 --> 26:19.097
to the surveillance net now.

26:19.182 --> 26:20.265
No, they're detailed.

26:20.350 --> 26:23.402
We got some photos
from the interrogation.

26:23.486 --> 26:25.487
Okay, well,
call me when you do.

26:26.722 --> 26:27.773
Any progress?

26:27.857 --> 26:30.025
Nothing yet, no.

26:30.076 --> 26:32.694
You got something
on your mind?

26:32.745 --> 26:35.497
Actually, yeah.

26:35.564 --> 26:37.732
That tracker
we had on Jones--

26:37.784 --> 26:39.084
how did he pinpoint
the wavelength we were on

26:39.168 --> 26:40.919
that quickly?

26:41.003 --> 26:43.372
What, you think someone
from our team told him?

26:43.423 --> 26:45.974
You have a better idea?

26:46.042 --> 26:49.244
<i>I'm sorry to interrupt.</i>

26:49.295 --> 26:51.596
That man, Peter--he says
he knows where Jones is going.

26:53.883 --> 26:55.350
I think he was looking
for a mineral

26:55.418 --> 26:56.685
named Amphilicite.

26:56.752 --> 26:59.805
It's found mostly under
sizeable deposits of limestone.

26:59.889 --> 27:01.940
I overlooked
its significance.

27:02.024 --> 27:04.976
Because on its own,
it has no significance.

27:05.061 --> 27:06.478
In its natural state,
it's inert.

27:06.562 --> 27:08.146
It's not really reactive,
like helium.

27:08.231 --> 27:09.614
But if you know how
to process it properly,

27:09.699 --> 27:11.616
it can be used as a power source.
- How do you know all this?

27:11.701 --> 27:12.734
Because where I'm from,

27:12.785 --> 27:14.619
William Bell used
a tiny amount of it

27:14.704 --> 27:15.821
to create a battery.

27:15.905 --> 27:17.105
Jones stole the battery.

27:17.156 --> 27:18.373
A battery made
out of rock?

27:18.441 --> 27:19.708
Yes, trust me,
with this stuff,

27:19.775 --> 27:21.159
you get a lot of bang
for your buck.

27:21.244 --> 27:23.044
Well, how much bang
are we talking?

27:23.112 --> 27:25.714
Enough to blow a hole
in the universe.

27:25.781 --> 27:28.133
I'm guessing Jones must have
figured out the same process

27:28.217 --> 27:30.669
that Bell did and possibly
how to weaponize it.

27:30.753 --> 27:33.388
Which is why
he's looking for it.

27:33.456 --> 27:35.757
Any idea where
he plans on getting it?

27:35.808 --> 27:37.225
<i>Of all the locations</i>

27:37.293 --> 27:38.810
he was studying,
the one with the most potential

27:38.895 --> 27:40.812
for Amphilicite
is located...

27:40.897 --> 27:42.731
Here.

27:42.798 --> 27:44.299
<i>The Hudson River Valley.</i>

27:44.350 --> 27:46.635
Right, and this is the map file
they accessed the most

27:46.702 --> 27:49.327
<i>on Dr. Fayette's hard drive--</i>
<i>the Mohonk Quarry.</i>

27:49.328 --> 27:50.447
<i>We contacted the quarry.</i>

27:50.448 --> 27:52.499
They said they haven't seen
any signs of trouble.

27:52.567 --> 27:55.068
Which means we may finally be
one step ahead of him.

27:55.120 --> 27:57.121
Contact Agent Lee.

27:57.205 --> 27:58.905
<i>I want that quarry</i>
<i>secured immediately.</i>

27:58.957 --> 28:00.007
Yes, sir.

28:14.422 --> 28:15.606
We're on the scene.

28:17.392 --> 28:19.042
<i>We've got the main</i>
<i>entrance secured</i>

28:19.110 --> 28:21.195
<i>and the quarries cleared.</i>

28:22.697 --> 28:24.364
<i>Looks like we</i>
<i>beat Jones to it.</i>

28:24.432 --> 28:27.451
Soil is undisturbed--
no signs of excavation

28:27.535 --> 28:29.119
for the last two months,
at least.

28:29.204 --> 28:30.521
Good.

28:30.588 --> 28:31.689
Let's secure the ridge line.

28:31.690 --> 28:33.390
Take up positions
on the western edge.

28:33.441 --> 28:35.092
<i>No one gets</i>
<i>in or out.</i>

28:40.433 --> 28:42.067
Can you patch me through

28:42.135 --> 28:43.735
You're on.

28:43.803 --> 28:45.270
There's an access road

28:45.321 --> 28:46.638
<i>above the quarry.</i>

28:46.689 --> 28:47.923
<i>It'd be easy for Jones</i>

28:47.991 --> 28:49.875
<i>to outflank you</i>
<i>if you don't guard it.</i>

28:49.943 --> 28:51.610
What access road?

28:51.661 --> 28:53.495
<i>It's just to the north</i>
<i>of your position.</i>

28:53.580 --> 28:55.164
There's no road.

28:55.248 --> 28:57.382
I'm looking right at it.

29:02.005 --> 29:03.605
Is this the map
that we downloaded

29:03.673 --> 29:04.840
from Dr. Fayette's
hard drive?

29:04.924 --> 29:05.824
It is.

29:05.875 --> 29:07.042
<i>Why?</i>

29:09.679 --> 29:12.231
We're in
the wrong universe.

29:15.468 --> 29:18.353
<i>Corridor tracking is complete.</i>

29:21.224 --> 29:22.241
Do it.

29:38.041 --> 29:40.993
Something about the air
on this side--

29:41.044 --> 29:43.912
it tastes sweeter.

29:50.039 --> 29:53.181
Tail to the west
makes weather best,

29:53.183 --> 29:54.883
and a tail to the east

29:54.968 --> 29:58.470
makes weather least.

29:58.521 --> 30:01.473
I told Astrid
she wouldn't need an umbrella.

30:01.524 --> 30:03.275
Excuse me, Dr. Bishop.

30:03.342 --> 30:04.543
You have a visitor.

30:04.611 --> 30:06.011
<i>Not now.</i>

30:06.062 --> 30:07.980
Can't you see we're
working on something

30:08.031 --> 30:10.199
very important.

30:16.206 --> 30:18.207
<i>Walter?</i>

30:36.759 --> 30:39.845
I'm not her.
You know that, don't you?

30:46.269 --> 30:48.186
Of course.

30:53.076 --> 30:55.444
You're from the other side.

31:00.083 --> 31:02.251
I never expected
to see you again.

31:06.005 --> 31:09.424
I suppose
it's appropriate that...

31:09.509 --> 31:12.294
A version of our son
should bring us together.

31:15.598 --> 31:17.749
<i>I came here for Peter.</i>

31:17.800 --> 31:21.086
I understand you're refusing
to help him.

31:24.641 --> 31:28.860
I'm sorry
you traveled so far.

31:28.928 --> 31:30.279
I can't.

31:30.363 --> 31:33.815
I have made my position
quite clear.

31:35.535 --> 31:37.819
The last time I saw you,

31:37.904 --> 31:40.656
you had come
to save a boy's life.

31:40.723 --> 31:43.258
Now I've come to do the same.

31:50.633 --> 31:51.967
Welcome home.

31:52.051 --> 31:53.952
For the record,
this was my idea.

31:54.003 --> 31:56.254
Later.
There's a chopper waiting.

31:56.306 --> 31:58.456
The tech team is already
en route to the location.

31:58.508 --> 32:00.291
We'll meet them there.

32:00.343 --> 32:01.760
How much trouble
you in?

32:01.811 --> 32:03.595
On a scale
of one to ten?

32:03.646 --> 32:05.063
A lot.

32:05.131 --> 32:06.765
I'm sorry.

32:06.816 --> 32:10.635
It'll blow over.
It's not the first time.

32:19.195 --> 32:21.196
Thank you.

32:23.366 --> 32:25.667
I-I used honey
instead of sugar.

32:25.752 --> 32:27.002
I-I thought--

32:27.086 --> 32:28.587
but if you would
prefer otherwise--

32:28.654 --> 32:30.505
Actually, I prefer honey.

32:31.708 --> 32:34.325
She did too...

32:34.377 --> 32:35.794
my Elizabeth.

32:37.797 --> 32:40.465
My being here must remind you
of so many things.

32:44.837 --> 32:47.505
I'm reminded
of something too...

32:47.557 --> 32:51.610
Of that night
26 years ago...

32:51.677 --> 32:54.146
When you came to me
on the other side

32:54.197 --> 32:57.015
and took Peter
away with you.

33:00.370 --> 33:01.653
I'm sorry.

33:01.704 --> 33:04.823
I should never
have done so.

33:04.874 --> 33:06.524
You were trying
to save him.

33:06.576 --> 33:09.995
He wasn't mine to save.

33:10.046 --> 33:13.165
I had no right.

33:13.216 --> 33:15.083
My Peter had already gone.

33:15.168 --> 33:18.170
You were still
a father.

33:18.221 --> 33:20.205
I saw how much
you loved him--

33:20.256 --> 33:21.223
your strength.

33:21.307 --> 33:24.309
Not strength--hubris.

33:25.711 --> 33:28.480
And I've been punished
for it ever since.

33:32.101 --> 33:33.819
Hmm.

33:33.886 --> 33:34.853
By whom?

33:34.904 --> 33:36.488
By God...

33:36.555 --> 33:39.274
By a deity--

33:39.358 --> 33:41.610
whatever you want
to call it.

33:41.694 --> 33:43.745
And I understand
I deserve it.

33:43.830 --> 33:45.330
No man should do
what I did.

33:45.397 --> 33:48.116
You made a mistake.
That's what being a man is.

33:48.201 --> 33:49.885
<i>It was more</i>
<i>than a mistake.</i>

33:49.952 --> 33:52.754
I broke universes.

33:56.843 --> 34:00.295
I asked for a sign
of forgiveness.

34:00.379 --> 34:03.048
<i>But I got nothing.</i>

34:04.917 --> 34:07.752
There is no absolution
for me.

34:09.688 --> 34:12.357
Well, I don't believe that.

34:16.112 --> 34:18.112
I forgive you, Walter.

34:22.952 --> 34:26.538
I forgave you
a long time ago.

34:26.605 --> 34:29.074
And if I can...

34:29.125 --> 34:31.775
God can.

34:41.838 --> 34:45.257
We both lost our sons.

34:45.308 --> 34:47.641
We never watched them...

34:47.726 --> 34:49.261
Grow up and...

34:49.312 --> 34:52.981
Fall in love, have babies.

34:53.065 --> 34:56.268
But there's
something of them in him.

34:56.319 --> 34:58.803
<i>This</i> Peter.

34:58.855 --> 35:03.658
<i>I know you feel it too.</i>

35:05.644 --> 35:07.812
And if you could
just help him...

35:11.984 --> 35:15.253
Walter, he deserves to go
back to the people he loves...

35:15.321 --> 35:16.922
and who love him.

35:20.843 --> 35:22.160
I'm afraid.

35:27.850 --> 35:29.968
So is he.

35:47.870 --> 35:49.037
<i>We've got incoming.</i>

35:49.121 --> 35:51.239
Secure the cargo.

35:51.324 --> 35:53.575
Hold them off.

35:53.659 --> 35:55.126
Let's go.

35:58.381 --> 35:59.664
Hey, can I get
one of those?

35:59.715 --> 36:02.000
- Think you'll need a gun?
- Better safe than sorry.

36:04.387 --> 36:06.588
Get down!

36:17.516 --> 36:21.736
We are done here.

36:34.584 --> 36:36.918
<i>That's Jones.</i>

36:37.003 --> 36:39.955
<i>Lincoln,</i>
<i>I'm going after Jones.</i>

36:41.374 --> 36:42.707
Give me your walkie.
What?

36:42.758 --> 36:43.842
Give me your walkie, now!

36:43.909 --> 36:45.576
Notify Colonel Broyles
on the other side.

36:45.628 --> 36:46.878
Have him to send a team
to meet me.

36:46.929 --> 36:47.846
<i>Olivia, stop!</i>

36:47.913 --> 36:49.681
Do not follow Jones!

36:49.748 --> 36:51.299
<i>The window will close</i>
<i>behind him.</i>

36:51.384 --> 36:53.351
<i>And if it closes</i>
<i>while you're going through it,</i>

36:53.419 --> 36:55.470
<i>it will kill you!</i>

36:55.554 --> 36:58.556
<i>Olivia, please, trust me.</i>

37:06.265 --> 37:08.817
Olivia?

37:12.488 --> 37:14.239
<i>I'm here.</i>

37:14.290 --> 37:16.441
You okay?

37:23.499 --> 37:25.834
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm okay.

37:32.747 --> 37:35.582
Seems only hours ago
that I asked Peter

37:35.633 --> 37:37.534
to be my emissary.

37:37.602 --> 37:39.119
<i>I knew that,</i>
<i>despite the accord,</i>

37:39.170 --> 37:42.622
<i>that there remained</i>
<i>a great deal of...</i>

37:42.674 --> 37:45.442
Distrust and trepidation
between our sides--

37:45.510 --> 37:49.463
much of it
directed towards me.

37:50.648 --> 37:52.599
<i>I also know the truth--</i>

37:52.650 --> 37:55.102
<i>that a new breed</i>
<i>of shape-shifter</i>

37:55.170 --> 37:58.105
had infiltrated
both our worlds.

37:58.156 --> 37:59.323
And the only way
to defeat them

37:59.407 --> 38:00.774
<i>meant working together,</i>

38:00.842 --> 38:02.609
<i>fully combining</i>
<i>our resources</i>

38:02.660 --> 38:04.194
<i>and our talents.</i>

38:04.279 --> 38:06.447
I thought that if you
heard this from someone

38:06.498 --> 38:08.298
more impartial...

38:08.366 --> 38:10.467
You'd see the imperative.

38:10.535 --> 38:13.754
That message
is no longer necessary.

38:13.821 --> 38:16.173
<i>We know who</i>
<i>our enemy is now.</i>

38:16.257 --> 38:20.928
And that in itself
is a distinct step forward.

38:22.514 --> 38:24.965
Now that we know that Jones
can cross between sides,

38:25.016 --> 38:26.100
we can coordinate
our search.

38:26.167 --> 38:28.419
You'll have
our complete support.

38:28.486 --> 38:30.804
That's all good,
but you said

38:30.855 --> 38:33.607
<i>that only a tiny amount</i>
<i>of this processed mineral</i>

38:33.674 --> 38:35.943
is enough to tear a hole
through a universe.

38:36.010 --> 38:37.528
So what
is he planning?

38:37.612 --> 38:39.346
As far as we can tell,
he's already recovered

38:39.397 --> 38:41.615
at least 100 pounds of it.

38:41.682 --> 38:43.016
She's right.

38:43.068 --> 38:44.451
We'll have to start
trying to game-plan

38:44.519 --> 38:45.652
what he's after.

38:45.703 --> 38:47.020
How?

38:47.072 --> 38:49.106
<i>We have no information</i>
<i>to work from,</i>

38:49.174 --> 38:51.125
and so far, he's been ahead
of us every step of the way.

38:51.192 --> 38:52.692
<i>Jones figured</i>
<i>we'd realize</i>

38:52.744 --> 38:54.128
<i>he was interested</i>
<i>in the quarry,</i>

38:54.195 --> 38:55.379
<i>so he crossed over</i>
<i>to the other side.</i>

38:55.463 --> 38:57.030
We recovered
his transport device.

38:57.082 --> 38:59.166
<i>Yes, but for all we know,</i>
<i>he has more of them.</i>

38:59.217 --> 39:01.552
He is holding
all the cards on this.

39:04.255 --> 39:05.756
<i>Not all of them.</i>

39:08.226 --> 39:10.761
You have me.

39:15.083 --> 39:17.017
I know him.

39:17.068 --> 39:19.853
And I saw how nervous he was
when I was questioning him.

39:19.904 --> 39:22.573
If nothing else,
I'm a variable

39:22.657 --> 39:24.491
that he didn't plan for.

39:24.559 --> 39:26.893
So, yes, we will all have
to work together.

39:30.198 --> 39:33.617
But somewhere,
we stopped him once before.

39:37.338 --> 39:39.923
And we can stop
him again.

39:42.127 --> 39:44.077
Okay, you have to tell me
everything you know

39:44.129 --> 39:45.379
about David Robert Jones--

39:45.430 --> 39:46.964
the one that you encountered.
- Of course.

39:47.048 --> 39:48.849
Okay, like, every little detail
that you remember.

39:48.916 --> 39:50.217
Sure.

39:50.268 --> 39:52.419
All right, I'm gonna see
what rooms are available.

39:52.470 --> 39:53.753
What? Now?

39:53.805 --> 39:55.272
We should get started
right away.

39:55.356 --> 39:56.923
No, let's
do this tomorrow.

39:56.975 --> 39:58.725
I feel like I haven't slept
in three days.

39:58.776 --> 40:00.260
First thing, I promise.

40:00.311 --> 40:02.946
Fair enough.

40:06.434 --> 40:08.602
You know, Peter, uh...

40:08.653 --> 40:12.122
Before, at the quarry,
if it weren't for you...

40:12.207 --> 40:14.491
You're welcome.

40:18.880 --> 40:22.282
All right, I'll have someone
pick you up in the morning.

40:25.503 --> 40:28.622
Yeah, yeah, I hear ya.

40:34.562 --> 40:36.630
Walter.

40:38.116 --> 40:39.933
Are you okay?

40:41.486 --> 40:43.987
- May I come inside?
- Yeah, yeah.

40:44.072 --> 40:45.656
Perhaps something
to drink--

40:45.740 --> 40:47.908
it's quite a long walk.

40:51.446 --> 40:53.947
Thank you.

40:56.784 --> 40:59.319
You should know
that your mother

40:59.370 --> 41:02.339
was a wonderful woman...

41:02.423 --> 41:05.642
Every version of her.

41:08.096 --> 41:09.713
She came to see you.

41:14.168 --> 41:16.103
I lost the people
I loved most,

41:16.170 --> 41:18.305
and I imagine
you miss them too--

41:18.356 --> 41:20.840
the people
you've left behind.

41:22.610 --> 41:24.194
Yes, I do.

41:28.199 --> 41:29.700
I'll help you, Peter.

41:33.988 --> 41:36.957
I will help you
get home.

41:40.295 --> 41:41.878
The last 25 years

41:41.963 --> 41:45.999
I've spent thinking
about losing my son.

41:46.050 --> 41:49.886
I thought I was
an expert on loss.

41:49.971 --> 41:52.222
Maybe that's
why you're here...

41:52.307 --> 41:56.093
Mm, because
there are still things

41:56.177 --> 41:58.262
that I need to learn.

42:00.982 --> 42:03.400
What?

42:06.988 --> 42:08.555
I just spent
the last several days

42:08.606 --> 42:11.074
with the other Walter.

42:11.159 --> 42:12.826
And I was very surprised
to learn

42:12.893 --> 42:15.078
that he's not the man
that I thought he was.

42:19.667 --> 42:23.620
But I am not at all surprised
to learn that you are.

42:23.705 --> 42:26.506
Is that a good thing?

42:26.574 --> 42:29.710
Yes, Walter.

42:29.761 --> 42:32.245
That is a very good thing.

42:35.883 --> 42:39.052
You know,
I used to live here.
