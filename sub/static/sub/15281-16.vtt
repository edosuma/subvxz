01:08.999 --> 01:10.999
Ken, go home.

01:11.299 --> 01:13.399
Sandra, wait.
What ?

01:13.499 --> 01:15.299
Just talk to me
for a second, ok ?

01:16.699 --> 01:17.599
Please ?

01:21.199 --> 01:22.099
Fine.

01:26.199 --> 01:27.199
What ?

01:28.599 --> 01:29.799
I just want to know
where you're going.

01:31.499 --> 01:33.099
Because I'm not
your girlfriend.

01:38.199 --> 01:40.399
I gotta go.
That's him ?

01:41.999 --> 01:42.999
Ken, don't !

01:46.199 --> 01:47.499
Ken, stop !

01:49.699 --> 01:51.099
Ken, don't !

01:51.199 --> 01:52.399
Who the hell
are you ?

01:53.699 --> 01:54.499
Ken !

02:00.599 --> 02:01.699
Oh, my god.

02:03.999 --> 02:05.999
What are you doing ?
That's my ex-Boyfriend.

02:28.599 --> 02:30.099
Oh, no, please !

02:30.199 --> 02:31.399
Ow !  Ohh...

02:34.299 --> 02:35.399
Good morning, emily.

02:35.499 --> 02:36.399
Have a good weekend ?

02:36.699 --> 02:38.399
Yeah.  No.

02:38.699 --> 02:39.499
Yes.

02:41.999 --> 02:43.899
No, it wasn't--
Ugh.

02:44.199 --> 02:45.799
I don't want
to get into it.

02:45.899 --> 02:46.899
No problem.

02:47.199 --> 02:49.399
It...  It just
feels weird for me

02:51.499 --> 02:53.499
I don't really know
you guys all that well yet.

03:01.299 --> 03:03.299
I think I totally
screwed up this date.

03:06.799 --> 03:07.599
Ok.

03:07.999 --> 03:09.999
What happened ?
You have to understand,

03:11.499 --> 03:12.899
Like, seriously.

03:12.999 --> 03:14.899
And I can fool people for days,

03:16.399 --> 03:17.899
But sooner or later,
I blow my cover

03:20.299 --> 03:22.599
And then he doesn't respond,

03:24.099 --> 03:24.999
What did you say ?

03:25.599 --> 03:27.199
"Kilgore trout. "

03:27.899 --> 03:29.299
Guy has a problem
with kurt vonnegut ?

03:30.599 --> 03:33.199
<i>I read slaughterhouse-Five
when I was 12 and it blew my mind.</i>

03:33.299 --> 03:34.199
Seriously, I couldn't get enough.

03:35.499 --> 03:36.699
Yeah, yeah.  Me, too.

03:38.099 --> 03:39.299
The one about
the american spy.

03:40.199 --> 03:41.699
"You are who you pretend to be. "

03:43.199 --> 03:45.899
Oh, my god.  I can't believe
you're a vonnegut fan.

03:45.999 --> 03:47.399
You just made my day.

03:49.899 --> 03:51.699
Conference room
in 5 minutes, please ?

03:52.599 --> 03:53.399
Got it.

03:55.699 --> 03:57.299
Sandra davis, 16 years old.

04:00.499 --> 04:02.799
This is her on-Again,
off-Again boyfriend

04:03.999 --> 04:05.799
Their bodies were found
in a park

04:07.899 --> 04:09.799
An affluent,
mostly white suburb

04:11.899 --> 04:13.099
It's the third
of 3 killings

04:14.999 --> 04:15.799
Hate crimes ?

04:17.798 --> 04:19.599
And vickie williams, 17.

04:19.699 --> 04:22.399
They disappeared from their homes
in central westchester one night.

04:23.799 --> 04:25.799
In a southern part
of the county near the city.

04:27.799 --> 04:30.299
?  ?  ?

04:34.299 --> 04:35.499
what about this couple ?

04:36.499 --> 04:37.899
Another swastika.

04:37.999 --> 04:39.599
This one
on the boyfriend's car.

04:39.899 --> 04:41.599
It's a different
victimology.

04:42.399 --> 04:43.599
Maybe just
an escalation.

04:44.899 --> 04:45.999
and it doesn't end there.

04:48.199 --> 04:49.199
A reverend williams,

04:51.799 --> 04:53.399
Racial hate in the suburbs.

04:53.499 --> 04:56.399
what we are seeing is pure apathy.

04:56.699 --> 04:58.199
Black kids
are getting killed

05:01.199 --> 05:03.699
When will these racists
be confronted ?

05:06.399 --> 05:09.199
A black kid was beaten
on the streets of groton this afternoon.

05:09.299 --> 05:10.899
Connecticut neo-Nazi group

05:13.299 --> 05:15.799
There are neo-Nazi groups
in connecticut ?

05:17.899 --> 05:19.699
?  ?  ?  Rate
to solve these crimes

05:26.699 --> 05:28.999
What are the racial demographics of groton ?

05:32.699 --> 05:34.799
I'd say the mayor
has reason to be worried.

05:35.699 --> 05:38.699
If it doesn't stop soon, it could flare up  ?

06:14.399 --> 06:16.199
"from the deepest desires

06:16.999 --> 06:18.999
"Often come
the deadliest hate. "

06:20.399 --> 06:21.699
Socrates.

06:22.499 --> 06:24.399
New York,
New York.

06:24.899 --> 06:27.699
Too bad we're flying straight to the suburbs.

06:28.099 --> 06:29.499
Hey, this is weird.

06:29.599 --> 06:30.699
?  ?  ?

06:30.799 --> 06:32.999
?  ?  ?

06:35.799 --> 06:38.799
Why would the unsub
use a date-Rape drug

06:44.699 --> 06:46.999
Maybe he wants
to weaken them so they can't fight back.

06:48.099 --> 06:49.999
In the victims
of the double homicide.

06:52.099 --> 06:53.499
The question is why.

06:53.599 --> 06:55.299
All right, we just got
new information.

06:56.899 --> 06:59.399
Of sandra davis
and ken newcombe,

07:03.099 --> 07:04.199
She showed it
to her parents,

07:05.599 --> 07:07.199
The police never figured out
who wrote it.

07:09.399 --> 07:12.099
"We see ken with you
and it makes us sick.

07:14.099 --> 07:15.499
"Or you will pay.

07:18.099 --> 07:19.399
Strange.
Doesn't seem real.

07:20.199 --> 07:22.199
First of all,
the use of "we"

07:23.299 --> 07:25.999
One individual trying to
diffuse responsibility.

07:28.099 --> 07:30.499
On the one hand,
"take care to stop this now,

07:31.699 --> 07:33.799
Presumably, they want them
to stop seeing each other.  But then,

07:33.999 --> 07:36.199
On the other hand, they don't want
them to go public with it.

07:38.699 --> 07:40.699
The point of hate crimes
is to increase publicity,

07:42.799 --> 07:44.899
An effective threat let's everybody
know that they're in danger

07:46.599 --> 07:48.799
The author would want sandra
to tell people about the note.

07:51.499 --> 07:54.199
Actually, it... doesn't sound
like a guy at all.

07:54.499 --> 07:56.499
"Take care to stop this"

07:58.399 --> 07:59.399
"Take care" ?

07:59.499 --> 08:00.999
Males don't use
this type of language,

08:03.099 --> 08:04.799
This message
is certainly written by a female,

08:06.899 --> 08:08.999
I'd say it's most likely
an adolescent.

08:09.099 --> 08:11.299
You think a girl
killed these kids ?

08:11.399 --> 08:13.199
I think a girl
wrote this note.

08:14.699 --> 08:15.899
You got a number 2 ?

08:16.199 --> 08:17.199
Maybe.

08:17.499 --> 08:20.499
Says here the autopsy
on sandra davis was inconclusive.

08:22.699 --> 08:24.299
She had some bruising
around her neck.

08:26.599 --> 08:27.699
A lot of questions.

08:33.698 --> 08:37.698
?  ?  ?  ?

08:39.799 --> 08:41.499
Agent jareau,
gregory hughes.

08:42.899 --> 08:44.198
This is detective rick ware

08:45.999 --> 08:48.199
We haven't had a murder here
in 2 years, you understand.

08:49.699 --> 08:51.399
So we put rick in charge.

08:51.499 --> 08:53.999
These are agents
gideon, hotchner,

08:54.099 --> 08:55.199
Morgan, and prentiss.

08:58.399 --> 09:00.199
Is...  It's just hard to fathom.

09:02.399 --> 09:03.199
What do you mean ?

09:03.299 --> 09:04.599
Well, this isn't the de south.

09:06.799 --> 09:08.699
Are you saying
you don't think this is a race issue ?

09:08.799 --> 09:10.599
All we're saying is
whatever happened here

09:12.699 --> 09:14.199
I wouldn't want you
entering this investigation

09:16.199 --> 09:18.099
Fact is, we don't know
what this is about yet.

09:19.599 --> 09:21.499
And make sure
that it's the same killer, first of all.

09:22.899 --> 09:23.899
We don't know that yet.

09:25.799 --> 09:27.199
Was written
by an adolescent girl.

09:28.799 --> 09:30.399
It's pretty straightforward
profiling.

09:33.099 --> 09:34.399
Is there a problem, officer ?

09:37.499 --> 09:39.599
But then
we talked to her and dismissed her.

09:40.699 --> 09:42.199
I think it's a waste of time.

09:42.299 --> 09:43.999
I'd like to decide that for myself.

09:47.499 --> 09:49.999
Sandra showed us
the note 2 weeks before she was killed.

09:50.099 --> 09:51.599
We asked around the school for who might have

09:53.499 --> 09:56.199
The only girl's name
that came up was tonya mathis.

09:56.499 --> 09:58.299
Rumor was ken dumped her
for sandra,

10:00.299 --> 10:01.699
Tonya was never his girlfriend.

10:01.799 --> 10:03.299
You said you talked to tonya about the note.

10:04.799 --> 10:06.899
She swore up and down
she had nothing to do with it.

10:09.499 --> 10:10.299
Why's that ?

10:12.399 --> 10:13.399
See for yourself.

10:15.899 --> 10:16.999
That's tonya ?

10:18.699 --> 10:20.399
Leave her in there
for a few minutes.

10:20.499 --> 10:22.499
You're gonna make
a 17-Year-Old girl sweat ?

10:24.299 --> 10:25.799
I want
to scare the hell out of her.

10:26.699 --> 10:31.799
?  ?  ?

10:32.899 --> 10:34.399
Did these kids live
near here ?

10:37.699 --> 10:39.199
Ken newcombe
about a mile east.

10:41.099 --> 10:42.999
When I was a kid, I used to hang
out in the park at night,

10:44.899 --> 10:46.799
Maybe, but I don't think
these two were out on a date.

10:47.099 --> 10:48.299
Why do you say that ?

10:50.499 --> 10:51.599
Sandra was wearing a dress,

10:52.599 --> 10:54.399
She was definitely dressed to go out.

10:56.099 --> 10:57.499
Ken's body was found here ?

10:59.699 --> 11:00.699
But from the bloodstains,

11:03.599 --> 11:05.099
And then dragged here.

11:07.299 --> 11:09.399
So the unsub
shot ken first,

11:09.999 --> 11:12.199
Sandra started
to run and he chased her down.

11:13.699 --> 11:15.299
Beat her and strangled her.

11:17.699 --> 11:19.199
He could overpower her,

11:20.999 --> 11:22.599
No, it's more than that.

11:22.899 --> 11:24.899
The killer took the time
and risked her escaping

11:27.399 --> 11:29.099
He was completely focused on her.

11:29.699 --> 11:31.499
Sandra didn't have
a date with ken.

11:32.299 --> 11:33.899
She had a date
with the unsub.

11:39.099 --> 11:39.999
Hello, tonya.

11:42.199 --> 11:43.199
We're with the f. B. I.

11:44.499 --> 11:46.399
I'm gonna get
right to the point.

11:46.999 --> 11:48.199
Writing a threat like this ?

11:48.699 --> 11:50.199
It's a federal crime.

11:50.899 --> 11:52.499
I told him
I didn't write that note.

11:54.099 --> 11:56.499
But this is not
the principal's office,you understand ?

11:56.599 --> 11:57.899
The people you threatened are dead.

11:59.499 --> 12:00.299
I know that.

12:01.799 --> 12:02.599
I got it.

12:04.999 --> 12:07.299
But we need to know
why you wrote that note.

12:09.499 --> 12:11.199
You were angry with ken

12:11.599 --> 12:13.199
Because he didn't
acknowledge you.

12:13.499 --> 12:14.399
I get it.

12:14.699 --> 12:16.599
He didn't admit
that you were his girlfriend.

12:17.899 --> 12:18.699
Yeah.

12:19.399 --> 12:20.499
What about sandra ?

12:21.099 --> 12:22.699
She's the one
who got the note.

12:23.499 --> 12:25.499
Why were you
so angry with her, tonya ?

12:27.299 --> 12:29.599
Oh, this isn't
just about her going with ken,

12:31.999 --> 12:33.499
That note says "we. "

12:34.399 --> 12:36.899
You wanted to make it look like
other people were in on it.

12:37.199 --> 12:39.599
Like the whole town
was against her. Why ?

12:40.799 --> 12:42.499
Is that the way
she made you feel ?

12:42.799 --> 12:44.299
Like everybody
was against you ?

12:48.499 --> 12:50.999
It was that stupid
talent show.

12:53.199 --> 12:54.299
What talent show ?

12:56.299 --> 12:58.699
I was just as good as her.

12:59.599 --> 13:02.999
She was just
this quiet little girl who nobody liked.

13:03.099 --> 13:05.799
Then she sings,
and suddenly she's all little miss popular,

13:08.299 --> 13:09.799
It's not fair.

13:11.799 --> 13:12.999
So, tonya...

13:13.799 --> 13:14.699
Look at me.

13:16.799 --> 13:19.099
You wrote this note
for revenge, didn't you ?

13:25.099 --> 13:26.799
I know it was stupid.

13:28.499 --> 13:31.099
But I just wanted
to scare them.

13:32.799 --> 13:33.999
I'm sorry.

13:46.199 --> 13:47.399
We called tonya's family
and friends.

13:50.199 --> 13:51.799
That girl
didn't kill those kids.

14:30.699 --> 14:31.999
It's how you've had to learn.

14:36.899 --> 14:38.199
anybody seen reid ?

14:38.799 --> 14:39.599
Where's reid ?

14:45.199 --> 14:46.499
Coroner's report.

14:46.899 --> 14:48.299
"Victim had been beaten
so extensively,

14:49.899 --> 14:52.299
Post-Mortem stab wounds
were also discovered. "

14:53.999 --> 14:54.699
What ?

14:57.899 --> 14:59.999
Uh, this is also
a fairly extreme overkill,

15:02.899 --> 15:04.199
So you're saying
this was a different killer.

15:05.699 --> 15:08.099
The overkill indicates he didn't get
what he wanted from someone...

15:12.699 --> 15:14.899
Derek: sexual predators kill
for sexual needs.

15:17.399 --> 15:19.399
That tells us
that he probably fetishises.

15:21.799 --> 15:23.299
He uses to get off.

15:23.599 --> 15:24.399
Correct me if I'm wrong,

15:26.299 --> 15:27.399
No, we're pretty certain
that hate

15:29.699 --> 15:31.199
He has a specific
physical type

15:33.199 --> 15:34.799
He is a serial killer.

15:49.199 --> 15:50.699
Hi.
Hi, naomi.

15:53.199 --> 15:53.999
Thanks.

15:57.999 --> 15:59.199
Thanks for picking me up.

16:04.899 --> 16:08.399
Reverend williams: and when
did the f. B. I.  Finally arrive ?

16:12.499 --> 16:16.299
We cannot rely
on the police.

16:16.699 --> 16:18.799
We must protect ourselves.

16:19.399 --> 16:21.699
Let the people
who are taking our daughters

16:24.899 --> 16:26.199
That's enough.

16:27.399 --> 16:28.899
The swastikas
on the bodies.

16:29.699 --> 16:30.399
What do they mean ?

16:32.199 --> 16:34.099
Hotch: perhaps
this killer isn't driven by hate,

16:35.099 --> 16:36.299
So we won't guess
his real motive,

16:37.899 --> 16:40.099
I'm confident the unsub's
from this county.

16:41.399 --> 16:43.199
That would flare up
from these swastikas.

16:44.399 --> 16:45.899
Judge is trying
to buy us some time.

16:47.099 --> 16:48.799
If he'll cool
his rhetoric a little bit.

16:48.899 --> 16:50.299
Hate crimes are political.

16:50.399 --> 16:51.599
If we're right,

16:52.399 --> 16:53.299
This was personal.

16:54.899 --> 16:56.499
Is linked
to the first 2 murders.

16:56.799 --> 16:58.899
We need to speak
to the families of the victims.

16:59.999 --> 17:02.099
We know how difficult
this is for you.

17:02.599 --> 17:03.899
Thanks for talking
to us.

17:04.199 --> 17:05.898
She just disappeared
that night.

17:06.398 --> 17:08.299
I know she must
have just walked out the front door,

17:10.398 --> 17:12.199
What about the window
in your daughter's bedroom ?

17:13.699 --> 17:15.098
It's been painted shut
for years.

17:17.699 --> 17:18.699
What are you talking
about, bree ?

17:20.299 --> 17:22.598
I fixed it
so I could get out.

17:23.199 --> 17:24.999
You've been sneaking
out in the middle of the night ?

17:25.199 --> 17:25.999
I'm sorry.

17:26.398 --> 17:27.398
You're not in trouble.

17:27.699 --> 17:28.699
But just tell me,

17:29.199 --> 17:30.899
Did she sneak out before ?

17:32.399 --> 17:34.999
She always told me
not to do it.

17:36.599 --> 17:37.799
She was the good one.

17:38.999 --> 17:40.499
She didn't deserve this.

17:42.399 --> 17:44.099
Nobody deserves this.

17:46.299 --> 17:47.599
Your daughter liked to sing ?

17:49.699 --> 17:51.499
We dug up everything
on the first 2 victims,

17:52.999 --> 17:53.999
Who stayed out of trouble.

17:54.299 --> 17:55.399
Just like sandra davis.

17:57.499 --> 17:58.999
One in church,
and one in a band.

18:00.599 --> 18:01.999
Just like sandra davis.

18:02.299 --> 18:03.899
African-American girls

18:06.199 --> 18:07.999
That's a pretty
specific type.

18:09.899 --> 18:11.099
And the fact
that they all sing,

18:12.399 --> 18:13.599
Maybe part of a ruse.

18:15.199 --> 18:16.799
A naomi dade.
16 years old.

18:18.099 --> 18:19.899
Why are we just
finding out about it now ?

18:21.399 --> 18:22.699
There's a chance
she's still alive.

18:22.999 --> 18:24.899
Let's get to the profile
before it's too late.

18:40.199 --> 18:41.499
Girl, on tape:
hey, I'm naomi.

18:41.599 --> 18:44.199
?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?

18:46.699 --> 18:48.599
?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?

18:54.899 --> 18:56.899
Suspect we're looking for
is a black male,

18:57.299 --> 19:00.199
Statistically between
the ages of 20 and 35.

19:00.999 --> 19:02.699
We know he's black
because of his victims.

19:02.899 --> 19:05.199
Sexually motivated killers
almost always kill

19:06.599 --> 19:08.199
The victims he's chosen
are good girls.

19:08.899 --> 19:09.999
They're good students.

19:10.499 --> 19:11.599
No behavioral problems.

19:11.899 --> 19:13.199
They're what we call
"low-Risk. "

19:14.799 --> 19:16.899
The higher the intelligence
of the unsub.

19:17.399 --> 19:18.599
Guy's a smooth talker.

19:19.199 --> 19:21.499
Makes people feel
at ease.  Gains their confidence.

19:22.199 --> 19:24.899
You'd be amazed
what these guys can talk people into.

19:26.099 --> 19:28.999
Jeffrey dahmer
was once pulled over by police officers

19:31.599 --> 19:33.599
He'd thrown the garbage bag
full of body parts

19:35.099 --> 19:37.199
But he was so calm
and so self assured,

19:40.499 --> 19:42.399
He then went on to kill
at least 15 more people.

19:42.899 --> 19:43.899
This guy's a hustler.

19:44.599 --> 19:46.099
He may not have
a lot of education,

19:49.299 --> 19:51.699
Victor paleologus
used to troll shopping malls

19:53.799 --> 19:54.899
He told kristine johnson

19:57.130 --> 19:58.930
And that was the last time
she was ever seen alive.

20:00.630 --> 20:02.330
We think that because
all these girls are singers,

20:04.330 --> 20:05.630
To the recording industry.

20:05.830 --> 20:07.230
We know the unsub
has a vehicle.

20:08.130 --> 20:09.430
Big enough to transport a body.

20:10.030 --> 20:10.830
It's clean.

20:11.230 --> 20:12.330
It's not too old.

20:14.030 --> 20:16.030
But it's not flashy.
This is not a guy

20:17.830 --> 20:19.330
Probably a large,
dark sedan.

20:19.530 --> 20:21.930
We recommend
putting this profile on the news,

20:24.830 --> 20:26.830
This guy's ruse
didn't work on everybody.

20:27.130 --> 20:28.630
Somewhere out there
is at least one woman

20:30.830 --> 20:31.930
That's who
we need to find.

20:33.630 --> 20:35.030
Is the souvenir he takes.

20:35.230 --> 20:36.630
We don't know
what it is yet, but...

20:37.230 --> 20:38.530
We know that
once he has it,

20:39.030 --> 20:40.730
His victim tn becomes
disposable,

20:41.830 --> 20:43.830
The unsub's ritual
was interrupted

20:46.130 --> 20:48.530
We don't believe
he was able to take a souvenir from her.

20:48.930 --> 20:50.830
We think he may
revisit her house

20:53.230 --> 20:54.730
We recommend surveillance
in locations

20:56.830 --> 20:58.230
Churches, high schools,

21:00.530 --> 21:01.730
Stick with the community.

21:02.730 --> 21:04.430
Should be able
to offer some good leads.

21:05.030 --> 21:06.130
Thanks a lot.
Good luck.

21:06.330 --> 21:07.130
Gid...

21:07.230 --> 21:08.530
Whoa.  Hold on,
hold on, hold on.

21:08.830 --> 21:10.430
You think
community vigilance will be enough ?

21:11.030 --> 21:12.630
If it were,
we'd be out of a job.

21:13.330 --> 21:15.130
I'm telling you not to do your job.  Jason.

21:15.930 --> 21:18.030
Just want to make sure
that we don't get ahead of ourselves.

21:19.030 --> 21:19.930
What's he doing ?

21:20.330 --> 21:23.330
So please
just sit tight one more minute.

21:23.530 --> 21:24.330
What's the problem ?

21:26.430 --> 21:28.430
To release this profile to the public.

21:29.430 --> 21:31.730
Reverend williams
has already stirred up enough trouble

21:33.730 --> 21:35.130
For his anti-Racism
campaign.

21:35.430 --> 21:37.530
What do you think
is gonna happen if I go to the press

21:38.830 --> 21:41.330
Hey.  The best way
to stop all this is to find that killer.

21:42.830 --> 21:44.830
Right.  By telling everybody
to look out

21:46.730 --> 21:48.330
They're gonna say
that's racial profiling.

21:50.030 --> 21:52.830
Racial profiling
is targeting suspects because of their race.

21:55.230 --> 21:56.230
All right, look.
The point is

21:58.430 --> 22:00.630
And neither have
all the african-Americans in this community

22:02.930 --> 22:05.530
You can believe
in black serial killers or not,

22:07.030 --> 22:09.230
And it's only a matter of time
before he kills another girl.

22:09.430 --> 22:11.730
All right, look.
I am not interested in debating this.

22:13.530 --> 22:14.730
Of heading
this investigation.

22:15.830 --> 22:16.830
You gonna let this happen ?

22:17.230 --> 22:18.930
Let what happen ?
Make every black man

22:19.830 --> 22:20.630
Rick.  What ?

22:21.030 --> 22:22.630
We found naomi dade's body.

22:22.830 --> 22:23.630
Damn it.

22:27.730 --> 22:28.730
What's it gonna be, detective ?

22:31.830 --> 22:32.630
Please.

22:33.430 --> 22:34.530
Let us help you.

22:39.930 --> 22:42.830
Finally, I want to assure you
we considered all options,

22:46.330 --> 22:47.130
Thank you.

22:51.430 --> 22:53.130
Detective, I think you made the right choice.

22:53.430 --> 22:55.330
I hope this doesn't
come back to bite us in the ass.

22:55.630 --> 22:56.430
Why would it ?

22:58.530 --> 23:00.430
That a dangerous
black man running around this county.

23:00.630 --> 23:02.430
Hotch: best way to solve
your problem is to stay focused

23:04.030 --> 23:04.830
Tell me.

23:06.430 --> 23:07.330
Tell me what to do.

23:08.630 --> 23:09.830
We need to get
the word out...

23:10.330 --> 23:11.330
Not just on the news.

23:13.930 --> 23:15.130
Gotta give them
the profile.

23:18.030 --> 23:20.430
That could be
where the unsub saw her sing.

23:23.730 --> 23:25.630
Set up a tip line.
Yeah, you got it.

23:28.030 --> 23:29.930
Well, I hate waiting around.
So, what do you say, ware ?

23:31.130 --> 23:32.130
Want to join the patrols ?

23:32.630 --> 23:34.730
Get back on the street ?
Pretend to be a beat cop again ?

23:35.730 --> 23:36.530
Yeah.

23:37.030 --> 23:38.730
Beats waiting around
here for more bodies, don't it ?

23:39.430 --> 23:40.230
Let's do it.

23:44.030 --> 23:45.530
Tips have just started
to come in.

23:48.730 --> 23:49.730
You don't have to do this.

23:51.830 --> 23:53.430
A janitor
at his school, and...

23:55.430 --> 23:56.330
Is anything useful ?

23:58.230 --> 24:00.230
Hey, uh, I got someone
who remembers seeing

24:03.230 --> 24:04.830
In front of our last victim's
house yesterday.

24:05.130 --> 24:06.530
That's the second sighting
for that vehicle.

24:08.730 --> 24:09.930
Include it
in the press release.

24:11.330 --> 24:12.130
Yeah, I got it.

24:15.030 --> 24:16.730
suspect may be
driving a black town car.

24:17.730 --> 24:18.630
May be ?

24:20.030 --> 24:20.930
It's something.

24:28.130 --> 24:28.930
No, I'm good.

24:33.530 --> 24:34.930
For what it's worth, um...

24:37.030 --> 24:38.930
Took balls to stand up
to the mayor like that.

24:40.230 --> 24:41.430
You would've done
the same thing.

24:43.430 --> 24:44.530
I don't have to work
for the guy.

24:45.630 --> 24:47.030
I know that was
a tough decision.

24:51.130 --> 24:53.030
Don't you ever wish
it didn't matter ?

24:55.130 --> 24:55.930
It ?

24:56.530 --> 24:57.330
Color.

24:59.530 --> 25:00.330
Hmph.

25:02.130 --> 25:04.330
Judge me by the content
of my character.

25:05.830 --> 25:08.030
I mean, why does it
even have to be part of the equation ?

25:08.830 --> 25:10.830
People are dying.
We need to get the bad guy.

25:12.830 --> 25:14.230
No half-Cocked reverends
running around,

25:17.630 --> 25:21.030
No mayors so afraid of
offending black folks,

25:29.230 --> 25:30.530
It's exhausting
sometimes.

25:33.130 --> 25:34.730
It's the way
it's always been, man.

25:36.330 --> 25:38.930
Politicians,
community leaders...  They do what they do.

25:40.730 --> 25:42.130
You and me...
We do what we do.

25:43.330 --> 25:45.930
We're the foot soldiers
in these streets getting the job done.

25:49.030 --> 25:50.030
Hmph.  Foot soldiers.

25:52.530 --> 25:53.330
Right.

25:54.030 --> 25:55.330
Only ones
who ever really get results,

26:01.130 --> 26:01.930
Ware.

26:02.630 --> 26:03.430
Right there.

26:03.730 --> 26:04.630
It's a black town car.

26:04.930 --> 26:07.030
Yeah, just a few blocks
from sandra davis' house.

26:10.030 --> 26:11.030
He's turning right.

26:11.830 --> 26:12.730
Turn right here.

26:17.730 --> 26:18.530
There it is.

26:28.230 --> 26:29.530
?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?

26:35.930 --> 26:36.730
Nothin'.

26:37.230 --> 26:38.030
You hear that ?

27:19.030 --> 27:20.330
Ware.  Yeah.

27:20.730 --> 27:22.330
It's a false alarm.
It's just a car service.

27:24.130 --> 27:26.230
All right.  I'll be right out.

27:32.130 --> 27:33.630
I got him !
I got him !

27:38.030 --> 27:39.230
What the hell are you doing ?  !

27:41.330 --> 27:44.130
The cops, damn it.
I'm f. B. I.

27:44.330 --> 27:46.430
What ?
Listen to me.  Do not shoot.

27:46.930 --> 27:49.130
I'm gonna reach
in my back pocket and grab my wallet.

27:49.930 --> 27:51.030
All right ?

27:51.830 --> 27:52.630
All right ?  !

27:57.030 --> 27:58.030
I'm f. B. I. , man.

28:00.430 --> 28:01.430
I didn't know.

28:02.830 --> 28:03.730
Give me your gun.

28:04.130 --> 28:05.030
Give me your gun !

28:06.730 --> 28:07.930
Go !  Call 9-1-1 !

28:10.530 --> 28:12.630
Ware, nah, nah, nah.
Come on, man.

28:14.730 --> 28:16.430
Ware, you're going
to be all right.

28:18.130 --> 28:19.330
Talk to me.

28:19.530 --> 28:21.030
Hey, just talk to me.
I'm right here.

28:21.830 --> 28:23.230
Tell me about
that family of yours.

28:25.930 --> 28:27.530
Yeah.  I saw
those pictures in your car.

28:28.130 --> 28:29.030
What's your
little one's name ?

28:29.630 --> 28:30.430
Huh ?

28:31.130 --> 28:33.230
D-Dwayne.

28:35.030 --> 28:36.630
That's good.  Come on.
I got you, man.

28:38.130 --> 28:39.330
All right ?  All right ?

28:41.930 --> 28:43.130
Uhh.  Uh...

28:45.130 --> 28:47.330
Come on.  Ware,
talk to me.  Say it.

28:47.930 --> 28:49.430
Hey...  Hey.
Don't you leave me.  No.

28:50.330 --> 28:52.730
Ware !  Ware !
No.  Come on, man.

28:52.930 --> 28:54.230
Ware !  Ware !

29:24.390 --> 29:25.490
What the hell happened ?

29:27.190 --> 29:28.590
Man: I didn't know
he was a cop.

29:30.390 --> 29:33.490
W-We saw this black car
parked in front of our house.

29:34.090 --> 29:36.290
This black guy with a gun
sneaking around the yard.

29:38.490 --> 29:39.590
I...  I was scared.

29:40.090 --> 29:40.990
I got a family.

29:43.790 --> 29:45.490
Where's morgan ?
Back here.

29:54.290 --> 29:55.090
You ok ?

30:05.390 --> 30:06.090
Yeah, j. J.

30:07.490 --> 30:08.290
You're kidding.

30:09.890 --> 30:11.090
Another girl
just went missing.

30:12.490 --> 30:13.490
All right,
we're on our way.

30:17.390 --> 30:18.590
The girl's name is ally hadley.

30:20.590 --> 30:21.590
But she never showed up there.

30:21.790 --> 30:23.190
Well, I'm sure
she's just out

30:24.790 --> 30:26.190
She says she never
does this.  She a...

30:27.390 --> 30:29.490
Yeah.  She's african-American.

30:33.090 --> 30:35.290
Guys we got a witness.
A girl who saw the report on the news.

30:36.890 --> 30:38.090
Claiming to work for
a record company.

30:39.190 --> 30:40.090
I'll call the others.

30:41.290 --> 30:43.690
It was after choir practice
at the church.

30:44.590 --> 30:45.990
He came up to me outside...

30:46.590 --> 30:47.390
This black guy.

30:48.390 --> 30:50.990
Told me he was
an executive at some record company

30:54.990 --> 30:58.190
He said I had a great voice,
and he'd like to record me.

30:58.990 --> 30:59.890
What did you say ?

31:00.290 --> 31:01.990
I told him
I wasn't interested.

31:02.690 --> 31:04.190
He gave me
some kind of business card

31:06.890 --> 31:09.090
It didn't even have
a company name on it...

31:12.490 --> 31:14.190
It looked so fake.

31:14.290 --> 31:15.790
How could anyone fall for that ?

31:16.790 --> 31:17.790
Do you have the card ?

31:19.190 --> 31:20.390
I didn't have to keep the card.

31:21.590 --> 31:22.390
Why ?

31:24.690 --> 31:25.690
I knew him.

31:31.990 --> 31:34.390
I was beginning to think
you guys had forgotten all about me.

31:34.690 --> 31:36.290
Well, we need you now
more than ever, hot stuff.

31:36.490 --> 31:39.490
Aww, it's like candy
to my ears, sugar.  Go.

31:40.690 --> 31:41.890
The guy's a freelance musician.

31:42.190 --> 31:44.090
Played keyboard
for the girls' high school musical.

31:45.890 --> 31:48.590
Terrance wakeland.

31:48.990 --> 31:50.390
In the new york
metropolitan area

31:53.590 --> 31:54.690
Computer says 3.

31:54.890 --> 31:57.390
He may work at
a recording studio or record company.

31:58.190 --> 32:01.690
Ok, I'm going
to cross reference with i. R. S.  Records.

32:02.190 --> 32:02.990
Gotcha.

32:03.390 --> 32:05.090
Mount vernon,
just outside the bronx.

32:09.290 --> 32:11.390
But he still works there
as a security guard.

32:12.290 --> 32:14.290
Thanks, mama.
You're the best.  Let's go.

32:17.690 --> 32:19.690
Man: you're lucky the studio
was available tonight.

32:20.490 --> 32:21.890
You're not nervous,
are you, ally ?

32:22.490 --> 32:23.590
No.
Good.

32:24.690 --> 32:26.790
I'll have you back
before your parents even know you're gone.

32:28.090 --> 32:28.890
Hey.  Let's go.

32:30.090 --> 32:31.790
Man on police radio:
all units to a & l studios,

32:34.090 --> 32:37.090
What are the chances
of us catching ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?

32:40.190 --> 32:43.190
* mama may have *

32:44.290 --> 32:47.490
* papa may have *

32:48.190 --> 32:51.190
* but god bless the child *

32:51.690 --> 32:53.990
* that's got his own *

32:54.790 --> 32:58.290
* that's got his own *

33:00.390 --> 33:03.390
Man: oh, that was it.
You killed that last take !

33:11.490 --> 33:14.690
I've never been in
a real recording studio before.

33:15.190 --> 33:16.390
Yeah.  Well,
you wouldn't know it.

33:17.690 --> 33:18.490
I mean,
you're so comfortable.

33:21.490 --> 33:22.590
It felt good.

33:22.890 --> 33:23.690
Yeah.

33:24.990 --> 33:26.990
Hey, I'm sorry.
Your...  Your throat must be tired.

33:43.490 --> 33:45.190
Hotch: hey, our road's closed.
Construction.

33:46.190 --> 33:47.090
Not that I know of.  No.

33:49.090 --> 33:50.590
Hey, you know
not a lot of girls your age

33:51.890 --> 33:52.690
Really ?

33:53.490 --> 33:54.890
And that look...
That face you got.

33:55.590 --> 33:57.690
I mean, you got this
real smokey kind of tone.

33:57.990 --> 34:00.190
Like something you hear in
a thirties harlem supper club.

34:00.690 --> 34:02.390
I mean, do you have any idea
what your music does to me.

34:03.290 --> 34:04.090
No.

34:05.790 --> 34:08.090
You get a song
stuck in your head.

34:08.590 --> 34:10.190
But for me,
it gets stuck right here.

34:11.690 --> 34:12.690
Once it's there,

34:14.389 --> 34:15.190
It's just...

34:15.389 --> 34:17.389
?  ?  ?  ?

34:19.489 --> 34:20.290
U  all right

34:29.389 --> 34:30.190
you all right ?

34:30.590 --> 34:33.489
Yeah.  Just...
a little dizzy.

34:35.389 --> 34:37.190
What I'm saying is that
it's so beautiful.

34:39.690 --> 34:40.690
Let it live.

34:41.090 --> 34:43.489
You ever feel that ?
Like there's something so beautiful...

34:44.889 --> 34:47.090
so beautiful you can't
let it live to show you...

34:47.889 --> 34:49.290
To remind you
of how ugly you are ?

34:50.190 --> 34:51.690
I...  I don't feel
so good.

34:55.489 --> 34:57.390
Son of a bitch !

34:57.590 --> 34:58.790
you think I'm ugly ?

34:59.090 --> 34:59.890
Aah !

35:18.090 --> 35:19.090
Help !

35:21.190 --> 35:22.590
Somebody help !

35:31.390 --> 35:32.290
Police officer:
i'll cover the door.

35:34.690 --> 35:36.490
?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?

35:39.190 --> 35:40.090
Right there.  Go.

35:45.690 --> 35:46.490
Check the back.

36:09.990 --> 36:10.790
Morgan !

36:14.990 --> 36:15.790
Yeah.

36:19.190 --> 36:21.290
Door are wide open,
lights are on.  Somebody left in a hurry.

36:21.490 --> 36:22.690
There was definitely
a struggle.

36:22.890 --> 36:24.090
So, maybe she's still alive.

36:25.790 --> 36:27.190
She could be in
the neighborhood, trying to get away.

36:29.190 --> 36:30.090
It's the voices, man,

36:30.690 --> 36:31.590
His souvenirs.

36:35.090 --> 36:35.890
Let's go.

36:36.490 --> 36:37.590
?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?

36:39.690 --> 36:40.490
Help me.

36:40.890 --> 36:41.690
What's the matter ?

36:45.090 --> 36:46.390
Where...  Where am i ?

36:47.690 --> 36:49.790
Whoa.  What did you take ?

36:52.390 --> 36:53.290
You know this girl ?

36:55.790 --> 36:56.790
Her parents are
out of town,

36:58.390 --> 37:00.590
And, uh,
she snuck out and obviously got herself

37:02.990 --> 37:05.190
Come on, ally.  Come on.
Party's over.

37:07.890 --> 37:10.090
I mean, look around you.
This is a dangerous neighborhood, ally.

37:11.490 --> 37:12.290
You know this man ?

37:12.990 --> 37:15.690
Again, officer,
I'm very, very sorry.

37:17.690 --> 37:19.290
Come on, ally,
you can sleep it off when you get home.

37:19.490 --> 37:22.490
Can I go now ?  Or am I gonna
have to stand here all night

37:23.890 --> 37:24.690
There they are.

37:33.290 --> 37:35.890
Wakeland, f. B. I.  !
Don't move !

37:37.590 --> 37:39.390
What did I do ?
Let her go.

37:40.490 --> 37:42.890
?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ? Right ?  !

37:44.090 --> 37:44.890
?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?

37:48.790 --> 37:50.090
He won't let her go.
He could be armed.

37:51.090 --> 37:52.290
Hey, what the hell
are you waiting for ?  !

37:54.590 --> 37:56.290
Put your weapons down
so we can move in.

37:56.890 --> 37:57.690
Do it !

37:58.290 --> 37:59.090
Do it !

38:03.490 --> 38:05.690
Wakeland,
get away from the girl.

38:05.890 --> 38:06.790
Turn around.

38:18.490 --> 38:19.290
Let's go.

39:30.090 --> 39:31.090
You all right ?

39:35.490 --> 39:36.290
I was just thinking.

39:38.890 --> 39:40.790
I know what it's like
to grow up without a father.

39:43.390 --> 39:44.590
Their father died a hero.

39:48.190 --> 39:48.990
So did mine.

39:51.490 --> 39:52.590
Doesn't make it
any easier.

40:03.090 --> 40:06.590
Jacob: "the life of the dead
is placed in the memory of the living. "

40:07.590 --> 40:08.390
Cicero.

40:13.690 --> 40:15.090
Oops !  Sorry.

40:18.090 --> 40:18.990
Oh, wait a minute.

40:21.190 --> 40:21.990
No, you didn't.

40:22.890 --> 40:24.090
Where did you find this ?

40:25.990 --> 40:28.190
Haven't read this in
fift...  Like...  12 years.

40:29.890 --> 40:31.590
Chapter 3's
where it starts to get good.

40:32.190 --> 40:34.090
Ok.  I will let you know
when I get there.

40:34.590 --> 40:35.590
All right, you do that.

40:43.490 --> 40:44.290
You all right ?

40:46.190 --> 40:46.990
Reid.

40:48.090 --> 40:48.890
Hmm ?

40:49.490 --> 40:50.490
I said, are you all right ?

40:51.890 --> 40:52.890
I'm fine.

40:55.590 --> 40:56.790
Thanks
for broadcasting it.

40:57.290 --> 40:59.090
Hey, talk to me.

41:00.790 --> 41:02.790
Whatever you say to me in
confidence is between us.

41:03.590 --> 41:05.190
I don't have anything
to tell you.

41:10.790 --> 41:11.690
Reid, listen to me.

41:13.490 --> 41:14.890
What you went through
out there,

41:15.790 --> 41:17.690
I can still do my job,
all right. I'm not gonna freak out.

41:19.790 --> 41:20.690
You think
I don't know that.

41:36.190 --> 41:37.490
It's the crime scene
photos.

41:40.290 --> 41:41.390
Crime scene photos ?

41:44.790 --> 41:46.090
The dead girls
in the leaves.

41:50.190 --> 41:51.290
Reid, we've seen worse.

41:52.590 --> 41:53.590
I know.

41:53.890 --> 41:55.490
I know
we've seen worse, but...

41:58.590 --> 42:01.690
For the first time, I know.

42:03.290 --> 42:05.490
I look at them, and...

42:07.690 --> 42:10.490
I look at them and I...
I know what they were thinking.

42:17.490 --> 42:18.590
That's called empathy.

42:19.690 --> 42:20.890
And it's a good thing.

42:25.890 --> 42:27.490
It's not.
It's got me all messed up.

42:36.890 --> 42:37.790
So, what do I do ?

42:37.890 --> 42:38.990
You use it.

42:41.190 --> 42:42.690
Let is make you a better profiler,

42:44.490 --> 42:45.590
A better person.

42:51.890 --> 42:52.890
A better person.

42:56.890 --> 42:57.690
Hmph.
