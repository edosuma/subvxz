<i>The government has a secret system.</i>
<b><font color="#0A7C32">Ripped By mstoll</font></b>

00:08.342 --> 00:12.688
<i>A machine that spies

00:12.846 --> 00:14.985
<i>I designed The Machine

00:25.492 --> 00:29.338
<i>Hunted by the authorities,
we work in secret.</i>

00:30.063 --> 00:31.701
<i>You'll never find us,</i>

- He won't eat, he sleeps all day.
- When he's not throwing up.

00:51.051 --> 00:52.091
Have you changed his food?

00:52.219 --> 00:54.062
Just the same
high-performance kibble

00:54.221 --> 00:56.360
plus the occasional table scrap.

00:57.291 --> 00:58.702
I never feed him from the table.

01:01.628 --> 01:03.574
Lethargy, vomiting,
and lack of appetite

01:03.730 --> 01:05.607
could indicate a more serious
underlying cause.

01:05.766 --> 01:07.370
I'd like to order
some additional tests.

01:07.534 --> 01:09.104
Whatever he needs.

01:09.269 --> 01:11.715
In the meantime,
I have some anti-nausea medicine

01:11.872 --> 01:15.319
that should ease his symptoms.
I'll be right back.

01:28.055 --> 01:32.128
- I'm sorry, you can't be in here.
- Neither can they.

01:32.292 --> 01:34.602
Give us the ketamine,
the doctor lives.

01:40.968 --> 01:42.504
You shouldn't have done that.

01:55.015 --> 01:56.187
Who are you?

01:56.350 --> 02:00.321
We're merely a couple of concerned
dog owners, Dr. Jensen.

02:01.788 --> 02:03.096
I don't know how to thank you.

02:04.491 --> 02:05.771
One of those expensive chew toys

02:05.795 --> 02:08.401
you have for sale
at reception would help.

02:11.765 --> 02:13.369
Bear likes his new vet.

02:13.533 --> 02:15.013
He's due for vaccinations in a month.

02:15.135 --> 02:16.808
It might be nice to visit Dr. Jensen

02:16.970 --> 02:19.951
when he's not participating
in a covert operation.

02:24.978 --> 02:27.356
<i>Please, help me.
I've lost my husband.</i>

02:27.447 --> 02:30.724
<i>I'm out on our boat
on Long Island Sound.</i>

02:30.884 --> 02:33.888
<i>- And where is your husband?
- He was here when I fell asleep.</i>

02:35.555 --> 02:37.057
<i>We have a new number, Mr. Reese.</i>

02:37.224 --> 02:42.333
Vanessa Watkins, former prosecutor
with the District Attorneys office.

02:42.496 --> 02:45.067
She's put away some of the city's
worst violent offenders:

02:45.232 --> 02:47.803
Rapists, murderers, drug traffickers.

02:47.968 --> 02:50.642
Married to Jeremy Watkins,
the defense attorney.

02:50.804 --> 02:53.080
Prosecutor married
to a defense attorney?

02:53.240 --> 02:55.220
Cats and dogs, Mr. Reese.

02:55.375 --> 02:59.323
Jeremy's helped countless alleged
criminals walk on technicalities

02:59.479 --> 03:01.584
but it appears now
he's the one in trouble.

03:01.748 --> 03:03.921
He's been missing at sea
for two days.

03:04.084 --> 03:06.360
Coast Guard's still looking for him.

03:06.553 --> 03:08.897
<i>Maybe an unhappy client
came back to haunt him.</i>

03:12.759 --> 03:17.105
Got eyes on Vanessa, Finch.
Has a friend with her.

03:17.264 --> 03:21.041
- Everything's gonna be all right.
- You don't know that, Nicole.

03:21.201 --> 03:23.943
Nicole Spencer,
Vanessa's best friend since college.

03:24.104 --> 03:25.583
She's consoling her.

03:29.609 --> 03:31.782
Finch, Vanessa's got another problem.

03:33.680 --> 03:36.786
Ms. Watkins, NYPD.

03:36.950 --> 03:40.227
You're under arrest for the murder
of your husband, Jeremy Watkins.

03:40.387 --> 03:43.095
Guess Jeremy's not missing anymore.

03:43.256 --> 03:46.203
<i>- Cops think she killed him.</i>
- Oh, dear.

03:46.359 --> 03:47.633
Hands behind your back.

03:47.794 --> 03:49.603
Did The Machine
give us her number too late?

03:49.763 --> 03:51.140
No.

03:51.298 --> 03:55.041
The Machine generated Vanessa's
number after Jeremy's disappearance.

03:55.202 --> 03:57.148
The threat is new and imminent.

03:57.304 --> 04:00.478
In that case, we need to get ears
on her interrogation.

04:00.640 --> 04:01.948
Let's go.

04:05.312 --> 04:09.158
Vanessa Watkins. Never thought I'd
see you on that side of the table.

04:09.316 --> 04:11.489
You were tough, I liked you.

04:11.651 --> 04:14.495
Hell, I even respected you,

04:14.654 --> 04:19.933
until you married that silver-tongued
slimeball in the 5,000-dollar suit.

04:20.093 --> 04:22.505
I would have thought a seasoned
prosecutor like Ms. Watkins

04:22.662 --> 04:24.573
would invoke her right
to an attorney.

04:24.731 --> 04:26.506
It's okay, keep quiet.

04:26.666 --> 04:29.272
Your SOS call
will do the talking for you.

04:32.005 --> 04:34.178
<i>Please, help me.
I've lost my husband.</i>

04:34.341 --> 04:37.788
<i>I'm out on our boat,
on Long Island Sound.</i>

04:37.978 --> 04:40.618
<i>- And where is your husband?
- He was here when I fell asleep,</i>

04:40.642 --> 04:43.151
<i>but I heard a noise,
and when I got to the deck,</i>

04:43.316 --> 04:45.796
<i>I saw his body floating away.</i>

04:45.952 --> 04:47.260
<i>Please help me.</i>

04:49.156 --> 04:51.830
I almost bought
your whole damsel-in-distress act.

04:53.426 --> 04:55.269
Your husbands blood.

04:55.428 --> 04:57.999
You were the only other person
on board,

04:58.165 --> 05:01.840
so we tested the statement you signed
for the Coast Guard,

05:02.002 --> 05:04.042
the one where you swore
your husband fell overboard.

05:04.204 --> 05:07.617
Know what we found?
Gunshot residue.

05:08.675 --> 05:11.986
Yeah, you forgot to wash your hands.

05:13.647 --> 05:15.649
Money makes people careless.

05:15.816 --> 05:18.023
With your husband gone,
you got a lot more of it.

05:18.185 --> 05:21.655
Five mil life insurance,
vacation home in...

05:21.822 --> 05:24.063
where was it again, Tuscany?

05:25.692 --> 05:28.298
Doesn't matter, you're never gonna
see it again. Why?

05:33.166 --> 05:36.579
Because we found the gun.
The gun you used to kill Jeremy.

05:36.736 --> 05:38.738
Witness saw you toss it
into the Long Island Sound.

05:38.905 --> 05:43.354
<i>So we dragged it.
Took a while, but we fished it out.</i>

05:43.510 --> 05:45.353
Ask me, you did the world a favor,

05:45.512 --> 05:48.254
ridding it of that scumbag
husband of yours.

05:49.416 --> 05:53.660
Tell us what really happened.
Well hammer out a deal.

05:53.820 --> 05:57.427
Such a damning list
of circumstantial evidence.

05:58.158 --> 06:02.334
So why are you pressing me
for a confession, Detective Cameron?

06:05.665 --> 06:08.339
You don't have a body, do you?

06:10.837 --> 06:12.748
You can show my attorney in now.

06:22.682 --> 06:25.185
- Thanks for coming.
- I was surprised you asked for me,

06:25.352 --> 06:27.298
considering you once told my boss

06:27.454 --> 06:31.027
I was, "A unique combination
of lazy and ineffectual."

06:32.459 --> 06:35.872
The conversation my attorney and I
are about to have will be privileged.

06:36.029 --> 06:38.236
I want all cameras removed.

06:41.301 --> 06:44.282
The judges are all home
with their brandy and cigars

06:44.437 --> 06:46.357
which means you get to spend
the night in lockup.

06:46.406 --> 06:48.750
Sorry, Detective,
we gotta clear the room.

06:56.249 --> 06:58.991
Sounds like Vanessa shot her husband.

06:59.152 --> 07:00.995
She's innocent until proven guilty.

07:01.154 --> 07:03.100
Or until her lawyer finds a loophole.

07:03.256 --> 07:05.827
Ms. Watkins was smart enough
not to ask for her attorney

07:05.992 --> 07:08.996
until she'd heard Detective Cameron's
entire case against her.

07:09.162 --> 07:11.164
She knows that without a body,

07:11.331 --> 07:14.801
he needs a confession
to bolster his case to the jury.

07:14.968 --> 07:17.168
Cameron's trying to keep her
in custody until she talks.

07:17.304 --> 07:20.308
For a prosecutor, a single night
in lockup could be life-threatening.

07:20.473 --> 07:22.009
We need to get her out of there.

07:23.109 --> 07:25.851
Yeah?

07:26.012 --> 07:29.323
<i>Detective, is Vanessa
still speaking with her attorney?</i>

07:31.851 --> 07:33.011
Vanessa's attorney just left.

07:33.119 --> 07:35.929
We need you to get Ms. Watkins
out of custody.

07:36.089 --> 07:37.762
Yeah.

07:42.929 --> 07:44.306
A little late for that.

07:44.464 --> 07:45.904
Vanessa knocked her attorney
out cold

07:46.032 --> 07:47.832
took her clothes
and walked right out of here.

07:47.856 --> 07:49.978
No wonder she requested Sarah Ellis.

07:50.136 --> 07:53.379
I'd be willing to wager they're
similar in age, height and build.

07:53.540 --> 07:57.454
So Vanessa's escaped
and she's an alleged murderer.

07:57.610 --> 08:01.114
Maybe The Machine gave us her number
because she isn't finished.

08:13.193 --> 08:14.194
All right, listen up.

08:14.361 --> 08:18.832
Domain Awareness captured footage
of the suspect, Vanessa Watkins,

08:18.999 --> 08:20.842
buying a bus ticket to Philadelphia.

08:21.001 --> 08:22.708
File should be in your inbox now.

08:22.869 --> 08:25.543
Our fugitive's bus leaves
in less than an hour.

08:25.705 --> 08:29.084
She will not be on it
because we will stop her.

08:31.077 --> 08:33.818
I received the footage.
Thank you, Detective.

08:34.914 --> 08:36.393
Come on.

08:40.820 --> 08:42.163
You got the coordinates?

08:42.322 --> 08:44.598
Five-block radius
on the southwest side of the station.

08:44.758 --> 08:46.760
I made a note
of every pay phone and ATM.

08:46.926 --> 08:48.667
- Nice work.
- Thanks.

08:48.695 --> 08:51.232
No, you're not listening to me.

08:51.398 --> 08:54.402
Like I told you before,
this group report back...

08:54.567 --> 08:55.967
That's what I'm trying to tell you.

08:56.036 --> 08:59.279
Detective Terney
seems a little... intense.

08:59.439 --> 09:01.077
Any advice on how to get along
with him?

09:01.241 --> 09:04.222
Some people on the force,
you're better off keeping your distance.

09:04.377 --> 09:06.857
- Not sure I get what you mean.
- You will.

09:15.188 --> 09:18.032
Finch, no sign of Vanessa
at the bus station.

09:18.191 --> 09:19.636
I think I know why.
As a prosecutor,

09:19.926 --> 09:22.964
Ms. Watkins would know the extent
of the city's surveillance network.

09:23.129 --> 09:25.268
She could have avoided
the cameras altogether?

09:25.432 --> 09:27.512
That's just it, she doesn't.
She looks right at them.

09:29.936 --> 09:32.712
She got caught on camera on purpose.

09:32.872 --> 09:35.614
She has no intention
of getting on that bus.

09:35.775 --> 09:37.812
Ms. Watkins
has already proven herself practiced

09:37.977 --> 09:39.581
at the art of deception.

09:39.746 --> 09:42.317
She's beginning to remind me of you,
Mr. Reese.

09:47.420 --> 09:50.492
I'll have Ms. Shaw
retrace Vanessa's steps.

09:57.497 --> 09:59.067
Vanessa seems
to have picked the pocket

09:59.232 --> 10:02.441
of an old man in an orange jacket
before she left the station.

10:02.602 --> 10:04.802
Have you seen anything
that would give you an indication

10:04.826 --> 10:07.752
- where she was going?
- No.

10:07.907 --> 10:10.148
But the old man
from the footage is back.

10:10.310 --> 10:11.846
I'm gonna ask him.

10:12.011 --> 10:16.517
Excuse me, did you lose something?
A wallet maybe?

10:16.683 --> 10:19.493
No, but I did misplace my cell phone.

10:19.652 --> 10:22.531
Well, if you give me the number,
I know somebody who can track it.

10:27.861 --> 10:29.363
There you go.

10:29.529 --> 10:33.534
Finch, drug dealers are the only
traffic we're seeing out here.

10:35.768 --> 10:37.679
You might wanna have another look.

10:52.051 --> 10:53.689
I'm here to see Reverb.

10:53.853 --> 10:57.528
Reverb's got a prior engagement.
I suggest you move along.

10:59.225 --> 11:01.466
Reginald, can you hear me?

11:06.232 --> 11:08.712
Only two people allowed
to call me Reginald.

11:10.136 --> 11:13.310
My moms and the courts.

11:13.406 --> 11:17.980
Finch, I'm sending you a photo.
Guy's first name is Reginald.

11:22.549 --> 11:25.257
Reginald "Reverb" Marshall.

11:25.418 --> 11:27.694
Recently released after sewing part
of a 20-year sentence

11:27.854 --> 11:31.392
for murder and drug trafficking.
Vanessa put him away.

11:31.558 --> 11:34.903
So, why is she visiting him now?

11:42.769 --> 11:46.410
Thanks for talking to that judge
for me, getting me out.

11:48.208 --> 11:49.728
<i>Finch, wanted to let you know.</i>

11:49.876 --> 11:52.447
Tip came through,
someone spotted Vanessa

11:52.612 --> 11:54.455
at a dealer's building
in Washington Heights.

11:54.614 --> 11:56.457
I appreciate that update, Detective.

11:56.616 --> 11:58.254
Detective Cameron's instructed us

11:58.418 --> 12:00.864
to consider the suspect
armed and dangerous.

12:01.020 --> 12:03.022
Is that standard operating procedure?

12:03.189 --> 12:05.309
<i>Not when there's no evidence
the suspect has a weapon.</i>

12:05.458 --> 12:06.596
I knew Vanessa.

12:06.759 --> 12:08.864
Worked a couple cases together.
She was tough.

12:09.028 --> 12:11.565
Don't know why,
but Cameron's determined

12:11.731 --> 12:13.802
to bring her in, dead or alive.

12:23.443 --> 12:25.616
Reginald just gave Vanessa
a brick of coke.

12:25.778 --> 12:30.124
What's a former prosecutor planning
to do with a kilogram of cocaine?

12:30.283 --> 12:32.661
Something illegal.

12:32.819 --> 12:35.390
Mr. Reese, police are on the way.

12:35.555 --> 12:38.126
<i>You and Ms. Shaw need
to vacate the premises.</i>

12:38.291 --> 12:40.498
I'll ask Detective Caner
to run interference.

12:40.660 --> 12:43.903
You need me to take care
of someone for you, just call me.

12:44.063 --> 12:45.565
Thank you.

13:02.315 --> 13:04.352
I want that building cleared,
floor by floor, now!

13:04.517 --> 13:07.020
- Yes, sir!
- Here!

13:10.623 --> 13:12.796
- Yeah?
- I've accessed the provider system

13:12.959 --> 13:14.802
for the cellular phone
Ms. Watkins acquired.

13:14.961 --> 13:17.441
Cameron's already spotted her.
He's searching the building now.

13:17.465 --> 13:18.737
Let me save you some trouble.

13:18.761 --> 13:20.941
I was able to turn
on the carrier phase tracking

13:21.100 --> 13:23.341
and determine the phones position
to within six inches.

13:23.503 --> 13:25.847
She's at the southwest corner
of the roof.

13:34.013 --> 13:36.186
The rest of you check the roof.

13:45.992 --> 13:49.303
- Come with me, I can help you.
- No one can help me.

13:50.563 --> 13:53.806
But I swear,
I did not kill my husband.

13:59.739 --> 14:01.514
No! Wait!

14:21.527 --> 14:23.529
Vanessa told me
she didn't kill her husband.

14:24.864 --> 14:27.276
- Do you think she's innocent?
- I don't know.

14:27.433 --> 14:29.777
But in that moment,
I thought she was telling the truth.

14:29.936 --> 14:33.076
I guess the former prosecutor
doesn't trust the system then.

14:33.239 --> 14:35.947
Think I'd be standing here in a
uniform if the system always worked?

14:36.109 --> 14:37.611
Detective Cameron ordered us

14:37.777 --> 14:39.757
to consider Vanessa armed
and dangerous.

14:40.947 --> 14:44.895
- Is Cameron HR?
- I wondered the same thing,

14:45.051 --> 14:46.962
but I asked around, and turns out,

14:47.120 --> 14:49.726
Jeremy Watkins had a client,
alleged murderer.

14:49.889 --> 14:53.302
Jeremy made Cameron out
to be a racist liar on the stand.

14:53.459 --> 14:54.733
The defendant walked,

14:54.894 --> 14:57.738
and the prosecutor who let Cameron
get hung out to dry?

14:57.897 --> 14:59.706
Vanessa Watkins.

14:59.866 --> 15:02.540
Cameron isn't HR.

15:02.702 --> 15:05.979
Catching Vanessa and making her pay,
it's personal.

15:06.139 --> 15:07.982
Thanks.

15:11.811 --> 15:15.554
Sorry.
Next time, I'll wait in the car.

15:30.163 --> 15:31.723
Vanessa would rather
jump off a building

15:31.747 --> 15:33.385
than have Cameron take her in.

15:34.634 --> 15:35.942
Bad guys always run.

15:36.102 --> 15:38.343
As do the so-called good guys.

15:38.504 --> 15:40.950
When the detective pursuing them
wants them dead or alive.

15:42.108 --> 15:44.179
I wonder, could Ms. Watkins
be a victim after all?

15:51.918 --> 15:52.953
Off.

15:55.188 --> 15:56.792
Good boy.

15:56.956 --> 15:58.396
Carter thinks she could be innocent.

15:58.524 --> 16:00.404
My money's still
on Vanessa killing her husband.

16:03.095 --> 16:05.871
You wanna put it to a bet?
How about 100 bucks?

16:06.032 --> 16:07.477
We really don't wager

16:07.633 --> 16:10.136
on whether our numbers
are victims or perpetrators.

16:10.303 --> 16:12.146
You guys have been doing this
for how long

16:12.305 --> 16:14.717
and not once did you think
to bet on the outcome?

16:14.874 --> 16:18.321
Regardless of your rather louche take
on what we do here, Ms. Shaw,

16:18.478 --> 16:21.152
the question remains, if Vanessa
didn't kill her husband, who did,

16:21.314 --> 16:23.658
and what has that to do
with her present jeopardy?

16:23.816 --> 16:27.559
I don't know,
but we need to find her.

16:29.622 --> 16:31.582
She's disposed of the cell phone
we were tracking.

16:31.606 --> 16:33.779
NYPD must have
frozen her accounts by now.

16:34.660 --> 16:36.071
She'll need money.

16:36.229 --> 16:37.909
Brick of coke
she has could help with that.

16:37.933 --> 16:40.204
Do you think Ms. Watkins plans
to traffic cocaine?

16:40.366 --> 16:42.073
If she does, she'll need help.

16:42.235 --> 16:44.647
People on the run
always make the same mistake,

16:44.804 --> 16:46.078
contact someone they know.

16:46.239 --> 16:48.378
Vanessa was with a friend
when she was arrested.

16:49.742 --> 16:51.915
Nicole Spencer.

16:52.078 --> 16:55.025
And Nicole is hosting
a book club today,

16:55.181 --> 16:57.058
in spite of Vanessa's predicament.

16:57.216 --> 16:59.696
Any of these ladies
not gonna make it?

17:00.820 --> 17:01.992
This Mindy is a maybe.

17:02.154 --> 17:05.601
Maybe means no.
I'll go as her friend.

17:09.762 --> 17:13.266
- Are you sure you'll fit in?
- Of course.

17:14.834 --> 17:17.007
I have a secret weapon.

17:21.107 --> 17:24.554
I'm here for book club.
I'm Mindy's friend, Carmen.

17:24.710 --> 17:27.190
Mindy couldn't make it this week.

17:28.114 --> 17:30.594
And we actually have a friend
who's going through a rough time.

17:30.618 --> 17:32.723
Oh, that's a shame.

17:32.852 --> 17:36.629
I don't know what I'll do
with all this chardonnay.

17:43.462 --> 17:45.100
Jeremy was a pit bull in court

17:45.264 --> 17:47.608
but he doted on Vanessa,
he gave her anything she wanted.

17:47.767 --> 17:49.906
Who would have thought
she was so unhappy?

17:50.069 --> 17:53.243
Wealthy, charismatic,
good looks to match?

17:53.406 --> 17:55.283
A man like that is hard to pin down.

17:55.441 --> 17:57.580
Olivia, please.

17:57.743 --> 18:01.156
Let's not make Mindy's friend think
we're just here to gossip.

18:03.749 --> 18:06.628
- Where's your powder room?
- Um...

18:19.265 --> 18:21.905
<i>Do I dare ask
how the book club is going?</i>

18:22.068 --> 18:24.844
<i>Bunch of pseudo-intellectual
glorified trophy wives.</i>

18:26.572 --> 18:30.247
Okay, so I ducked out,
logged in to Nicole's bank account.

18:30.409 --> 18:33.583
She is not sneaking money to Vanessa.

18:33.746 --> 18:35.020
Has Vanessa made contact?

18:42.622 --> 18:45.034
Take a look.
We're up on Nicole's phone.

18:46.192 --> 18:50.140
Doesn't appear that Ms. Watkins
has reached out to her best friend.

18:50.296 --> 18:54.472
The majority of the texts I see
are from a male friend,

18:54.634 --> 18:57.376
and they're of rather
a graphic nature.

18:57.536 --> 19:02.383
- Nicole's got a boyfriend?
- Yes, named "Hot Stuff."

19:06.045 --> 19:07.285
Oh, dear.

19:10.950 --> 19:14.227
Nabokov faced some unique challenges

19:14.387 --> 19:16.367
writing so honestly
about forbidden love.

19:16.522 --> 19:18.502
Speaking of forbidden love,

19:18.658 --> 19:20.258
did you frame Vanessa
for Jeremy's murder

19:20.359 --> 19:21.895
because you were sleeping with him?

19:23.829 --> 19:27.367
Sorry, not Jeremy, "Hot Stuff."

19:27.533 --> 19:29.706
I didn't... I...

19:32.171 --> 19:34.549
Up to me,
I'd shoot your sorry ass.

19:34.707 --> 19:37.415
Unfortunately, it's not,
so I have to protect you

19:37.576 --> 19:40.016
because your best friend might be
on her way here to kill you.

19:40.040 --> 19:44.045
Now, what's this book about?

19:45.851 --> 19:47.387
I took another look
at Vanessa's file:

19:47.553 --> 19:49.396
the evidence
just wasn't sitting right with me.

19:49.555 --> 19:52.195
- How so?
- The GSR on Vanessa's hands.

19:52.358 --> 19:55.202
Forensics found trace amounts
all over the deck

19:55.361 --> 19:59.537
but the largest concentration?
On Vanessa's cosmetics.

19:59.699 --> 20:02.407
So either Vanessa shot her husband
and then put on eye shadow...

20:02.568 --> 20:04.445
Or the gunshot residue was planted.

20:04.603 --> 20:07.277
Whats the name of the witness
who helped the police find the gun?

20:10.443 --> 20:14.414
Scott Rawlins. He works at the marina
where the Watkins kept their yacht.

20:14.580 --> 20:15.752
I'll have a talk with him.

20:17.416 --> 20:21.023
Nice boat, even for people
with a place in Tuscany.

20:28.961 --> 20:33.205
Who was that man
in Washington Heights in the suit?

20:35.434 --> 20:37.471
Look, we're adults.

20:38.738 --> 20:40.378
I don't have to know everything
about you,

20:40.402 --> 20:42.507
you don't have to know
everything about me.

20:46.112 --> 20:47.819
Well, I think it's good
you're moving on.

20:47.980 --> 20:49.152
Excuse me?

20:49.315 --> 20:53.559
From Beecher.
Good for you for seeing someone new.

20:54.987 --> 20:57.729
Yeah, thanks.

20:57.890 --> 21:02.305
I got a fiancée myself.
of course, she'd rather elope.

21:03.562 --> 21:08.011
Well, me, I want the blow-out party,
all my friends and family there.

21:08.167 --> 21:10.613
Your fiancée, she from a big family?

21:10.770 --> 21:13.410
No, she's not real close
to her folks.

21:13.572 --> 21:16.280
Probably why she
doesn't want the big party.

21:18.911 --> 21:22.324
- Thanks, Carter.
- No problem.

21:28.087 --> 21:30.089
Did you talk to your contact
at INTERPOL?

21:30.256 --> 21:34.796
The yacht the Watkins owned,
valued at five mil, but get this.

21:34.960 --> 21:37.770
It's leveraged to the hilt and about
to be repossessed by the lender.

21:37.930 --> 21:40.536
<i>A shell corporation
that belongs to a mobster.</i>

21:40.699 --> 21:43.339
Jeremy Watkins
owed a mobster 5 million dollars?

21:43.502 --> 21:47.541
At least. All of Jeremy's accounts
were in the red, except for one.

21:48.607 --> 21:50.609
A charity by the name
of "Innocence Now."

21:50.776 --> 21:52.881
<i>Where is this account based,
Detective?</i>

21:53.045 --> 21:54.353
Greenwich, Connecticut.

21:54.513 --> 21:57.494
- I guess I'm going to Greenwich.
- If you wouldn't mind.

21:57.650 --> 21:59.561
<i>I'm sure Ms. Shaw
has had enough chardonnay</i>

21:59.718 --> 22:02.995
<i>and Nabokov for one afternoon.
I'll have her join you.</i>

22:04.723 --> 22:07.226
<i>Mr. Reese, Jeremy Watkins
was deeply in debt</i>

22:07.393 --> 22:09.066
<i>to an organized crime affiliate.</i>

22:09.228 --> 22:11.504
It's entirely possible
that they killed Jeremy.

22:11.664 --> 22:14.167
If they knew he would never pay,

22:14.333 --> 22:16.973
they could have killed him
to send a message to Vanessa.

22:17.136 --> 22:19.309
Yes, "Pay up or else!"

22:19.471 --> 22:21.871
Ms. Watkins is beginning
to look more and more like a victim,

22:22.007 --> 22:24.317
although I can't explain
why a victim would procure

22:24.476 --> 22:26.422
such a large amount of cocaine.

22:26.812 --> 22:27.812
<i>I think I can.</i>

22:27.847 --> 22:30.191
I just found the witness
against Vanessa.

22:32.318 --> 22:33.922
Scott Rawlins.

22:34.086 --> 22:36.088
Perhaps he dumped the gun
that killed Jeremy.

22:36.255 --> 22:38.861
Were you able to ask him
about the planted evidence?

22:39.024 --> 22:43.837
No, because someone
just planted evidence on him.

22:44.697 --> 22:46.677
Finch, the cops
just arrested Scott Rawlins

22:46.832 --> 22:48.436
for possession with intent to sell.

22:48.601 --> 22:52.447
Had a brick of cocaine identical
to the one Reginald gave Vanessa.

22:52.605 --> 22:56.553
She planted drugs on the witness
against her to discredit him.

22:56.709 --> 22:58.780
Exactly what I would have done.

22:58.944 --> 23:00.504
<i>In that case,
I still can't speak</i>

23:00.528 --> 23:02.414
<i>to whether she's a victim
or a perpetrator.</i>

23:02.581 --> 23:04.219
But Vanessa can.

23:04.383 --> 23:07.387
She stuck around
to admire her own work.

23:23.402 --> 23:27.145
Frame a man up,
then steal his car to get away.

23:28.407 --> 23:32.583
You're good, Vanessa.
We need to talk.

23:41.453 --> 23:44.730
I just spoke to Mr. Reese.
They're 15 minutes away.

23:44.890 --> 23:46.665
Are you sure this is a good idea?

23:46.825 --> 23:48.327
It seems to me, the best way to start

23:48.494 --> 23:50.940
would be to ascertain
Ms. Watkins' guilt or innocence

23:51.096 --> 23:52.575
in the death of her husband.

23:52.731 --> 23:55.610
From there, we can attempt
to figure out the current situation.

23:55.768 --> 23:57.338
If Ms. Shaw were here,

23:57.503 --> 24:00.609
she'd be willing to wager double
or nothing that Vanessa's the threat.

24:00.773 --> 24:03.617
So Vanessa's guilty,
we turn her over to a corrupt cop

24:03.776 --> 24:05.056
who might be trying to kill her?

24:05.080 --> 24:06.990
And if she's innocent,
we let her go free,

24:07.146 --> 24:10.150
at which point, she may still be
trying to kill somebody.

24:10.316 --> 24:13.695
We need to figure out
which flawed plan is best.

24:13.852 --> 24:15.763
I can help with that.

24:24.363 --> 24:28.368
What the hell is going on?
Who are you people?

24:28.534 --> 24:31.208
As of this moment, Ms. Watkins,
we are your judge and jury.

24:31.370 --> 24:33.543
You're here to make your argument.

24:33.706 --> 24:36.880
I can name at least three felonies
you're committing.

24:37.042 --> 24:40.046
Kidnapping, unlawful
imprisonment, coercion!

24:40.212 --> 24:42.214
Why should I make my argument to you?

24:42.381 --> 24:45.726
Because if we decide that you're
innocent of your husband's murder,

24:45.884 --> 24:47.886
we can provide you
with an alternate identity

24:48.053 --> 24:49.964
and a fresh start in a new city.

24:50.122 --> 24:53.729
If you're guilty,
we turn you over to the NYPD.

24:57.229 --> 25:00.369
I remember you.
You worked Homicide.

25:01.133 --> 25:03.636
NYPD is full of dirty cops.

25:03.802 --> 25:05.748
Don't have to tell me that.

25:05.904 --> 25:08.009
But I don't think you're one of them.

25:11.076 --> 25:12.987
So this trial you wanna have.

25:15.547 --> 25:17.424
I'm game.

25:19.685 --> 25:22.825
Surveillance footage clocked
our fugitive getting into this SUV

25:22.988 --> 25:24.262
approximately 80 minutes ago.

25:24.423 --> 25:27.836
She got a friend, male.
Appears to be wearing a suit.

25:27.993 --> 25:29.768
Plate readers are on the lookout
for the car.

25:29.928 --> 25:32.374
Set up a perimeter around the Marina.
Close off the bridges.

25:32.531 --> 25:34.251
Find anyone who's seen them,
talked to them,

25:34.275 --> 25:36.255
thought about them.
Now.

25:38.604 --> 25:42.780
Your husband's blood on the deck,
GSR on your hands...

25:42.941 --> 25:45.444
- And on my cosmetics.
- You read the police report.

25:45.611 --> 25:48.717
I swiped a copy from Cameron's desk
on my way out of the station.

25:50.015 --> 25:52.791
- Wouldn't you?
- Probably.

25:52.951 --> 25:57.058
My husband wasn't murdered.
He drowned.

25:57.222 --> 25:59.896
Someone planted that evidence
and framed me.

26:00.059 --> 26:01.538
Prove it.

26:01.693 --> 26:05.300
I'm the defense.
Burden of proof lies with you.

26:05.464 --> 26:06.636
You can object.

26:06.799 --> 26:08.801
- Fine, I object.
- Overruled.

26:12.438 --> 26:15.578
I found this
in Scott Rawlins' locker.

26:16.608 --> 26:20.988
- When you planted the drugs?
- Yes, $50,000.

26:21.146 --> 26:23.786
A Marina guard
doesn't make that in a year.

26:23.949 --> 26:25.986
Someone paid him
to plant the evidence,

26:26.151 --> 26:28.324
tell the police
where to find that gun,

26:28.487 --> 26:31.093
the same person who is framing me.

26:31.256 --> 26:33.236
You have no chain of custody
for that money.

26:33.392 --> 26:36.669
- It could have come from anywhere.
- What?

26:38.397 --> 26:40.673
You used to put bad guys away,

26:40.833 --> 26:43.279
then you married a defense attorney,

26:43.435 --> 26:46.416
one notorious
for helping murderers walk.

26:48.941 --> 26:52.320
Why did you switch sides like that?
Was it the money?

26:57.983 --> 27:00.862
My first murder trial, I was a wreck.

27:01.019 --> 27:03.192
Rehearsing every night in the mirror,

27:03.355 --> 27:06.529
picturing the jury in their
underwear, all the old tricks.

27:06.692 --> 27:08.467
I was winning.

27:09.528 --> 27:12.475
Until the defendant
hired new counsel.

27:12.631 --> 27:16.545
Jeremy. He trounced me.

27:18.203 --> 27:20.513
But he was kind afterwards.

27:21.373 --> 27:22.943
Told me I had grit.

27:24.476 --> 27:28.049
He wouldn't have let
Cameron hunt me down like this,

27:28.213 --> 27:30.386
Jeremy would have protected me.

27:30.549 --> 27:34.463
He wasn't protecting you when he
ran up all that debt to a mobster.

27:34.620 --> 27:37.726
But, now that he's dead,

27:37.890 --> 27:40.996
that life insurance policy
will wipe out all his debt

27:41.160 --> 27:43.071
and you'll finally be in the black.

27:43.228 --> 27:45.071
Jeremy and I had a living trust.

27:45.230 --> 27:48.234
That agreement stipulates
that if he died

27:48.400 --> 27:51.040
under suspicious circumstances,

27:51.203 --> 27:52.682
I wouldn't see a penny.

27:52.838 --> 27:56.980
And I won't.
Everything is going to our charity.

27:57.142 --> 27:58.519
"Innocence Now."

27:58.677 --> 28:01.248
Are you a co-signer on that account,
Ms. Watkins?

28:01.413 --> 28:04.519
I might be, I don't know.

28:04.683 --> 28:06.924
Jeremy took care
of all the paperwork.

28:07.085 --> 28:08.894
If Jeremy took care
of all the paperwork,

28:09.054 --> 28:10.397
how did you know about the debt?

28:11.523 --> 28:16.666
I found a threatening note on my car
a few nights before Jeremy died.

28:16.828 --> 28:19.604
We were supposed
to be having a romantic dinner

28:19.765 --> 28:23.907
but I confronted Jeremy on the yacht.

28:24.069 --> 28:25.275
We argued.

28:25.437 --> 28:29.112
But I went below deck
to just clear my head.

28:30.275 --> 28:32.755
When I came back up,
Jeremy was gone.

28:34.713 --> 28:37.751
The last thing
I said to my husband was...

28:39.051 --> 28:42.624
...I was sorry
that we ever got married.

28:45.457 --> 28:50.429
But I didn't mean it
and I didn't kill him.

28:53.732 --> 28:55.405
You have to believe me.

29:07.479 --> 29:10.392
What was the account name again?

29:11.883 --> 29:13.260
Innocence Now.

29:21.426 --> 29:22.426
Oh.

29:23.262 --> 29:25.435
That's not my password now, is it?

29:33.605 --> 29:36.142
- Yeah.
- Would you be able to tell me

29:36.308 --> 29:39.653
if Ms. Watkins is a co-signer
on the Innocence Now account?

29:39.811 --> 29:43.190
Not yet. They do things
a little slower here in Greenwich.

29:43.915 --> 29:45.189
That's not good.

29:45.350 --> 29:50.265
The little wheel's spinning.
I'll just restart.

29:51.523 --> 29:53.525
I gotta go.

29:54.860 --> 29:57.534
Even for you,
stabbing a senior would be a new low.

29:57.696 --> 29:59.300
You don't know that.

29:59.431 --> 30:00.431
Oh, uh...

30:00.499 --> 30:02.945
The Innocence Now account...

30:03.101 --> 30:07.140
...had a balance
of just over $20 million yesterday,

30:07.306 --> 30:10.310
but it was transferred into
an external account this morning,

30:10.475 --> 30:12.648
by the co-signer.

30:12.811 --> 30:14.848
You got a copy
of this co-signer's ID?

30:17.549 --> 30:19.495
Your husband was having an affair.

30:19.651 --> 30:22.029
Even without the money,
you had motive.

30:22.187 --> 30:24.394
In most cases,
I'd agree with you.

30:24.556 --> 30:29.164
- Why not in this one?
Because I had an affair, too.

30:30.395 --> 30:33.740
Ms. Watkins, we found no evidence
that would confirm that statement.

30:33.899 --> 30:36.311
I have a second e-mail.

30:42.341 --> 30:44.685
His name was Colin.
He was a doctor.

30:46.511 --> 30:48.991
But I broke it off with him.

30:49.147 --> 30:52.822
E-mail correspondence appears
to corroborate your story.

30:54.486 --> 30:56.989
Jeremy and I were struggling
this past year.

30:57.155 --> 30:59.328
He was busy with work.

30:59.491 --> 31:02.995
He had a purpose and I was lost.

31:04.229 --> 31:05.936
I wasn't the person he married.

31:06.098 --> 31:10.547
I knew he'd found other women.

31:11.536 --> 31:15.951
But enough was enough.
I... I broke it off with the doctor.

31:16.108 --> 31:19.180
Jeremy swore he was through
with his indiscretions.

31:19.344 --> 31:22.621
We... We were on the yacht

31:22.781 --> 31:26.456
to rekindle our relationship.

31:26.618 --> 31:32.125
So you thought one romantic dinner
on a yacht would fix your problems?

31:32.290 --> 31:37.865
No, but...
we had to start somewhere.

31:45.237 --> 31:47.581
Look me in the eye
and tell me you loved him.

31:49.541 --> 31:52.078
Tell me you didn't wanna tear
his face off.

31:57.215 --> 31:59.252
Do I look angry to you?

32:00.652 --> 32:02.097
I loved Jeremy.

32:04.089 --> 32:05.830
I still do.

32:14.466 --> 32:17.140
Even though he was having an affair
with your best friend?

32:18.503 --> 32:20.983
He... What?

32:21.139 --> 32:24.143
Even I might consider
that justifiable homicide.

32:27.579 --> 32:29.752
I don't understand. I...

32:32.150 --> 32:33.959
Nicole would never do that.

32:36.121 --> 32:38.101
Jeremy would never do that.

32:38.256 --> 32:42.136
Sorry, Vanessa, but he did.

32:48.200 --> 32:51.477
Plate readers caught the 10-16.
Give me a ten-block radius.

32:51.636 --> 32:53.116
Show any potential witness the BOLOs.

32:53.271 --> 32:56.684
We found the vehicle,
let's find the suspects, now!

32:58.944 --> 33:00.064
<i>All units, all units.</i>

33:00.111 --> 33:02.887
<i>Suspect vehicle found
at 58th and 8th.</i>

33:03.048 --> 33:04.493
They found the car.

33:04.649 --> 33:07.061
We need to decide what to do
with Ms. Watkins soon.

33:07.219 --> 33:11.292
The evidence against her was planted.
She dismissed any financial motive.

33:11.456 --> 33:15.563
And Nicole and Jeremy's affair
was news to her.

33:17.362 --> 33:19.899
- I don't think she killed him.
- I'm inclined to agree.

33:20.065 --> 33:22.170
Reasonable doubt
in this case abounds.

33:22.334 --> 33:24.314
Should we put it to a final vote?

33:28.840 --> 33:30.012
Go ahead.

33:30.175 --> 33:32.175
Innocence Now account
was cleaned out this morning.

33:32.199 --> 33:32.849
By Vanessa?

33:33.011 --> 33:37.153
No, co-signer, Henry Shain.
We're sending a photo now.

33:42.187 --> 33:44.030
Henry Shain is Jeremy Watkins.

33:46.091 --> 33:50.267
- Vanessa didn't kill Jeremy.
- Because Jeremy is still alive.

34:01.273 --> 34:05.119
How can Jeremy be alive?
I saw his body in the water.

34:05.277 --> 34:07.188
It's easy to make that mistake
at night.

34:07.345 --> 34:08.551
He faked his death.

34:08.713 --> 34:12.286
He... framed me.

34:12.449 --> 34:14.760
Despite the unfortunate
circumstances,

34:14.920 --> 34:16.797
it does prove your innocence,

34:16.955 --> 34:18.514
but you're also
the only person standing

34:18.539 --> 34:20.460
between your husband
and his new life.

34:20.625 --> 34:22.696
I could put Jeremy behind bars.

34:22.860 --> 34:25.808
You're a loose end and we believe
Jeremy might come after you next.

34:25.964 --> 34:27.568
We need to get you out of town.

34:27.699 --> 34:30.873
<i>All units, proceed to
the southeast corner of 56th and 6th.</i>

34:31.069 --> 34:32.275
They're entering the building.

34:38.310 --> 34:39.812
NYPD, open up!

34:42.080 --> 34:43.991
Vanessa, time to go, come on.

34:51.322 --> 34:54.167
- Hands up! Stay where you are!
- Nobody move!

34:54.326 --> 34:56.272
Yo, keep them up!

35:01.333 --> 35:04.940
What the hell?
Who gave us this intel?

35:05.103 --> 35:09.279
Someone called in a tip.
A Mr. Swan.

35:15.180 --> 35:17.126
<i>10-2, report back to base, now.</i>

35:17.282 --> 35:20.525
Any idea how the police ended up
on the wrong side of town?

35:20.685 --> 35:23.291
Ms. Morgan gave me a tip regarding
an underground gambling ring.

35:23.455 --> 35:26.095
I just wanted to make sure
the police discovered and stopped it.

35:26.257 --> 35:30.205
So you left the SUV they were looking
for near the building.

35:30.362 --> 35:34.208
Of course, I didn't.
Mr. Reese took care of that.

35:35.467 --> 35:37.777
I was merely doing my civic duty.

35:46.277 --> 35:48.154
- Are you okay?
- I don't know.

35:49.714 --> 35:53.389
You're leaving your life behind.
That's a scary thing.

35:53.551 --> 35:54.791
Have you ever had to start over

35:54.815 --> 35:57.165
because someone
was trying to kill you?

35:57.322 --> 36:00.030
You could say that.
Come here.

36:07.065 --> 36:09.705
Jeremy wants me dead.
He'll find me.

36:12.070 --> 36:14.812
Vanessa, you're smart.

36:14.973 --> 36:16.418
You're strong.

36:17.308 --> 36:20.346
If I were Jeremy, I'd know better
than to come after you.

36:20.512 --> 36:23.254
I don't know if I'll ever feel safe.

36:28.420 --> 36:33.233
All right, maybe this'll help.
It's loaded.

36:35.927 --> 36:39.875
Thank you.
For everything.

36:41.700 --> 36:43.407
You're welcome.

36:46.571 --> 36:50.246
- Your bus leaves soon.
- Yeah.

36:51.676 --> 36:53.519
Don't wanna miss it.

37:04.622 --> 37:07.626
I appreciate you
letting me eavesdrop.

37:07.792 --> 37:10.068
No problem.
My lunch hour is over, though.

37:10.228 --> 37:13.801
Better get back before Cameron turns
the troops on me.

37:13.965 --> 37:15.945
Something wrong, Detective?

37:20.605 --> 37:23.643
Most people think that sweaty palms
or an increased heart rate

37:23.808 --> 37:28.154
are the only involuntary responses
your body gives when you lie.

37:29.748 --> 37:31.750
They would be wrong.

37:32.650 --> 37:35.096
Her husband tried to frame her
for his murder.

37:36.054 --> 37:37.397
Can't blame her for being angry.

37:37.555 --> 37:40.331
Except she tore that picture
before she knew he was still alive

37:40.492 --> 37:43.166
and before she knew
about the affair with Nicole,

37:43.328 --> 37:45.239
when she told me she loved him.

37:54.606 --> 37:56.847
Maybe she did love him.

37:57.008 --> 37:59.921
I've taken the liberty
of revisiting the HSAID database.

38:00.078 --> 38:02.598
Henry Shain didn't obtain his
own passport to leave the country.

38:02.680 --> 38:05.854
His wife did it for him
and she procured one for herself too.

38:06.017 --> 38:08.759
Jeremy wasn't the only one
with a false passport.

38:08.920 --> 38:11.958
Vanessa made that SOS call
to the Coast Guard.

38:12.123 --> 38:14.194
She helped Jeremy fake his death.

38:14.359 --> 38:17.340
Vanessa's been in on the plot
from the beginning.

38:17.495 --> 38:19.702
She and Jeremy planned
to empty out the accounts

38:19.864 --> 38:22.208
of their so-called charity
and run away with the spoils.

38:22.367 --> 38:25.541
Until he double-crossed her
and framed her for his own murder.

38:25.703 --> 38:30.277
Jeremy deceived Vanessa
and Vanessa deceived us.

38:33.311 --> 38:36.224
Mr. Reese, Vanessa was lying
when she said she loved her husband.

38:36.381 --> 38:37.883
<i>She helped him fake his death.</i>

38:38.049 --> 38:40.655
- Are you still with her?
- She's boarding her bus.

38:40.819 --> 38:42.457
Are you sure?

38:54.399 --> 38:56.470
Vanessa's not on the bus, Finch.
She's gone.

38:57.468 --> 38:58.868
<i>She knows
her husband is still alive</i>

38:58.903 --> 39:00.383
and that he framed her
for his murder.

39:00.407 --> 39:02.415
- She despises him.
- She's gonna kill him.

39:02.574 --> 39:04.315
Vanessa's been
the perpetrator all along.

39:04.475 --> 39:06.875
She's been plotting her husband's
murder since he framed her.

39:06.978 --> 39:08.582
Which means her crime
is premeditated.

39:08.746 --> 39:11.192
- And I gave her a weapon.
- You what?

39:11.349 --> 39:13.329
Seemed like a good idea at the time.

39:13.484 --> 39:16.693
- We find Jeremy, we find her.
- He needs to get out of New York.

39:16.855 --> 39:19.859
I know one mode of transportation
no one's checking.

39:30.902 --> 39:32.210
Anything to report?

39:32.370 --> 39:35.715
I think my new partner is starting
to trust me.

39:37.375 --> 39:41.118
And I saw her boyfriend.
Maybe you know him.

39:48.720 --> 39:53.100
- Nicole, I'm home!
- Expecting someone else?

39:54.859 --> 39:56.861
No, no, no, I just, um...

39:58.363 --> 40:01.003
Hey, what took you so long?
You were supposed to meet me yesterday.

40:02.467 --> 40:04.947
But today's better.
Cops just released the crime scene.

40:05.103 --> 40:06.980
We are free to go.

40:07.138 --> 40:09.448
You duplicitous son of a bitch.

40:10.875 --> 40:13.321
This is all a misunderstanding.

40:13.478 --> 40:17.153
I mean, you know I still love you,
right, angel?

40:18.316 --> 40:22.093
Now, come on.
We can make this work.

40:22.253 --> 40:26.099
Get out of New York, ditch the boat,
make a new life.

40:26.257 --> 40:30.103
Hard to save your marriage
after you frame your wife for murder.

40:31.930 --> 40:35.571
- Who the hell are you?
Concerned third party.

40:39.737 --> 40:41.978
So happy that you
found someone else, angel.

40:42.140 --> 40:43.915
Truly. Good for you.

40:44.075 --> 40:47.852
He's not my someone else.
He's just someone I can't get rid of.

40:48.012 --> 40:51.255
Come on, we both knew that
our marriage was just a contract.

40:51.416 --> 40:53.293
Not to me, it wasn't.

40:53.451 --> 40:56.864
I thought you meant it
when you told me we could disappear,

40:57.021 --> 40:58.864
get out from under the debt,

40:59.023 --> 41:04.336
make a new home,
make a new life for us, just us.

41:05.797 --> 41:07.435
I helped you fake your death.

41:07.598 --> 41:10.204
Swore to the Coast Guard
I'd seen your body disappear

41:10.368 --> 41:14.145
so they could declare you dead,
just like we planned.

41:14.305 --> 41:18.720
Until you framed me
and robbed our charity.

41:18.876 --> 41:22.483
To what?
Run off with Nicole?

41:24.382 --> 41:29.297
Maybe you're right
that our marriage is just a contract,

41:29.454 --> 41:33.732
but if that's true, you owe me.

41:33.891 --> 41:36.064
Well, look at you.

41:36.227 --> 41:38.571
So angry, bitter.

41:39.797 --> 41:41.674
You used to be so beautiful.

41:41.833 --> 41:44.837
You led the police
to believe I shot you on a yacht

41:45.003 --> 41:46.846
then threw your body overboard.

41:48.473 --> 41:52.387
Who can blame me for doing
what everyone says I already did?

41:53.711 --> 41:55.088
Do something.

42:00.685 --> 42:02.426
You framed your own wife for murder.

42:07.358 --> 42:09.599
You deceived me
to kill your own husband.

42:12.430 --> 42:15.775
I'm in the business of stopping
bad things from happening.

42:17.335 --> 42:21.613
I'm not so sure what's about
to happen is a bad thing.

42:45.730 --> 42:48.210
Mr. Reese, how's Ms. Watkins?

42:48.366 --> 42:52.872
Don't know, but you might
wanna call the Coast Guard

42:53.037 --> 42:56.314
<i>and you owe Shaw 100 bucks.</i>
