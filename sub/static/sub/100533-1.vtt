13:41.221 --> 13:42.687
Mm.

13:42.789 --> 13:45.123
You need to back off
talking smack about me.

13:45.225 --> 13:47.192
Drop the charges.

13:47.294 --> 13:49.394
You know, last time
was a romantic walk in the park

13:49.496 --> 13:51.396

You worked
for the attorney general?

16:37.197 --> 16:38.997
-Yes.
-What was your area of focus?

16:39.099 --> 16:40.498
Initially it was delivering

16:40.600 --> 16:42.500
a still piping-hot
venti quadruple shot,

16:42.602 --> 16:45.136
but blessedly it transitioned
into drafting docs

16:45.238 --> 16:47.772
for women's issues,
mostly, domestic violence

16:47.874 --> 16:51.476
in a department
that I-I helped reestablish.

16:51.578 --> 16:53.044
Well, if there are
no other questions...

16:53.146 --> 16:54.512
We can...

16:54.614 --> 16:55.813
Oh. Okay, really?

16:55.915 --> 16:57.448
Because there's a great deal
more that

16:57.550 --> 16:59.584
I didn't include on my resume.
I studied abroad.

16:59.686 --> 17:01.686
And, um,
my-my dissertation was about

17:01.788 --> 17:04.689
international fluid
policy change and then I--

17:04.791 --> 17:06.591
Will you accept the position?

17:08.561 --> 17:11.362
We've been following you
since your second year at Emory.

17:11.464 --> 17:13.564
We know you're being courted
by another firm.

17:13.666 --> 17:16.300
We'd ask, instead of you having
a second interview with them,

17:16.403 --> 17:17.702
you join us.

17:19.005 --> 17:21.539
Wow! Yes. Yes!

17:21.641 --> 17:24.075
Hey. Anything stopping you
from starting on Monday?

17:24.177 --> 17:27.045
We've got a civil case pending
we could really use you on.

17:27.147 --> 17:29.414
Nothing, nothing at all.
Count me in.

17:29.516 --> 17:32.116
Terrific.

17:32.218 --> 17:36.087
Now, this part I like to call
the little hurricane.

17:36.189 --> 17:39.690
And this here is the eye of it.

17:42.062 --> 17:43.761
That is your baby.

17:47.967 --> 17:49.801
(Letty)
You are back on track!

17:49.903 --> 17:52.003
The universe is pulling for you.

17:52.105 --> 17:53.905
And about time.

17:54.007 --> 17:56.107
And no one deserves it
more than you,

17:56.209 --> 17:58.676
especially after
all that horrendous-ness.

17:58.778 --> 18:00.044
Is that a word?

18:01.381 --> 18:03.414
So I have a cousin
who got pregnant

18:03.516 --> 18:05.583
and didn't want to be and...

18:06.686 --> 18:08.719
I wanna keep the baby, Letty.

18:08.822 --> 18:10.054
You do?

18:11.724 --> 18:13.791
I mean, you've worked so hard,
all that school,

18:13.893 --> 18:15.626
and now this dream job.

18:15.728 --> 18:17.862
You sleep
with your law books, Ames.

18:19.332 --> 18:21.365
It just...

18:21.468 --> 18:24.102
It feels kind of impulsive.

18:24.204 --> 18:28.072
I know. I must seem crazy.

18:28.174 --> 18:31.008
I'm so furious with myself
that I couldn't fight him off.

18:31.111 --> 18:35.613
And, and my body
just felt broken, dead.

18:37.417 --> 18:40.084
And now
I'm growing this little life.

18:40.186 --> 18:42.386
It's very much
a part of me already.

18:42.489 --> 18:44.622
But isn't it gonna be
a reminder of--

18:44.724 --> 18:46.958
Strength.

18:47.060 --> 18:49.894
That he took so much from me.

18:49.996 --> 18:53.097
And now this baby, I feel like

18:53.199 --> 18:55.666
I'm not broken, after all.

18:55.768 --> 18:57.135
I have hope now.

18:58.771 --> 19:01.772
I've always believed
in a woman's right to choose,

19:01.875 --> 19:03.141
even my own.

19:05.445 --> 19:06.677
I just...

19:07.447 --> 19:09.046
I have to keep it.

19:10.083 --> 19:13.918
Well, then,
congratulations, mama.

19:14.020 --> 19:16.687
This is going to be
the greatest and hardest thing

19:16.789 --> 19:18.723
you'll ever have to do.

19:23.663 --> 19:25.563
She says you threatened her
in the grocery-store parking lot

19:25.665 --> 19:27.598
on Main Street and 5th.

19:29.802 --> 19:32.470
Sir, I-I saw her and said hello.

19:32.572 --> 19:34.438
You know, to be polite.

19:34.541 --> 19:35.873
She's just some woman
who flirted with me

19:35.975 --> 19:37.241
that night at the bar.

19:37.343 --> 19:39.043
And then you dropped her home
in a taxi?

19:39.145 --> 19:41.012
Yeah, sure. Her and her friend.

19:41.114 --> 19:43.347
I live close by,
and they were pretty...

19:43.449 --> 19:45.049
[chuckles]
Well, they were
pretty inebriated.

19:45.151 --> 19:46.450
So I saw them safely home.

19:46.553 --> 19:48.186
And that's the last
you saw of 'em?

19:48.288 --> 19:50.688
Yes, sir.
Sorry I can't tell you more.

19:50.790 --> 19:52.857
No, that's great. Thank you.

19:54.260 --> 19:55.893
It's a nice badge.

19:59.966 --> 20:02.533
Just gonna get
some more color added to mine,

20:02.635 --> 20:04.001
freshen it up a little bit.

20:04.103 --> 20:05.970
Yeah, wife wants me
to get rid of it.

20:06.072 --> 20:08.606
She's got a bee in her bonnet
since she's pregnant.

20:08.708 --> 20:10.875
About as far along
as Ms. Thompson.

20:13.980 --> 20:16.781
Well, you know what they say,
babies change everything.

Don't you just look
so much better!

20:29.329 --> 20:33.731
It's like night and day. You're
just positively a-glowing!

20:33.833 --> 20:38.102
-How are you, mom?
-I am relieved!

20:38.204 --> 20:39.637
Alright, now let's have
a sip of champagne

20:39.739 --> 20:41.706
and celebrate your new job!

20:42.709 --> 20:44.408
Hey, mom, um,

20:44.510 --> 20:47.044
I'm not gonna drink today, okay?

20:47.146 --> 20:49.347
It's okay if we have
a little sip in the afternoon.

20:49.449 --> 20:51.082
[chuckles]

20:51.184 --> 20:52.583
No, it's, um...

20:54.020 --> 20:56.254
It-it's because I'm pregnant.

20:57.323 --> 21:00.157
You're what?

21:00.260 --> 21:02.793
My God, since when
did you even have a boyfriend?

21:02.895 --> 21:05.429
And when were you gonna
introduce me to him?

21:06.199 --> 21:07.732
Um...

21:07.834 --> 21:09.634
No, I...

21:09.736 --> 21:12.169
I got pregnant from the rape.

21:13.506 --> 21:15.539
Oh, my God.
You can't be serious.

21:17.677 --> 21:19.543
I'm-I'm keeping it.

21:21.781 --> 21:23.781
Now, look.

21:23.883 --> 21:27.785
I know that you have always been
a head-strong little thing.

21:29.022 --> 21:31.422
But a child from that man?

21:32.558 --> 21:34.158
Every time you look at it,

21:34.260 --> 21:36.294
you're gonna see his face.

21:36.396 --> 21:40.064
This baby is the only thing
keeping me

21:40.166 --> 21:41.565
from the dark place
he took me to.

21:41.668 --> 21:44.502
Oh, give me an F-in' break.
This isn't Super Soul Sunday.

21:44.604 --> 21:48.272

What about...

21:48.374 --> 21:50.274
Oh, God. What about your career
and your future?

21:50.376 --> 21:52.343
What-what about your reputation?

21:54.113 --> 21:56.814
And what man in his right mind
is gonna want a woman

21:56.916 --> 21:59.050
with a child born from rape?

22:01.020 --> 22:03.154
I'm not thinking
about a man right now, mom.

22:03.256 --> 22:05.189
You're not thinking. Period.

22:05.291 --> 22:07.692
You can't have this kid.

22:10.229 --> 22:11.696
Yes, I can.

22:12.965 --> 22:14.198
And I will.

22:14.300 --> 22:18.469
You are not just destroying
your reputation...

22:18.571 --> 22:20.604
you're destroying mine, too.

22:28.781 --> 22:30.581

22:40.460 --> 22:43.327
I am more than happy
to leave this nightmare.

22:43.429 --> 22:45.096
Have you thought about
the future

22:45.198 --> 22:47.264

who the daddy is?

22:59.379 --> 23:01.045
Hey, guys,
what are you doing here?

23:01.147 --> 23:02.813
Owen paid Demetri
a little visit.

23:02.915 --> 23:04.982
Yeah, and told him what
a sick son-of-a-bitch he was.

23:05.084 --> 23:06.917
-You went to his gym?
-Yes.

23:07.019 --> 23:10.554
Look, I hated myself for letting
him join us that night, okay?

23:10.656 --> 23:12.123
But he said
that he didn't touch you

23:12.225 --> 23:14.125
and that you have him confused
for someone else.

23:14.227 --> 23:15.960
<i> And he got real pissed.</i>

23:16.062 --> 23:18.729
He could barely
keep his .... together.

<i>-And scary lawyers.</i>

23:51.597 --> 23:52.630

Hey, that's great!

I can't go. I can't leave you.

23:56.502 --> 23:59.970
No, you have to go. Absolutely.
Go get 'em, girl.

24:00.072 --> 24:02.006
Okay, I'll only be gone
for, like, two days.

24:02.108 --> 24:03.073
Owen, you'll stay with her,

24:03.176 --> 24:04.108

Why is the restraining order
hearing taking so long

25:55.688 --> 25:58.556
and why isn't he answering
to the rape charge first?

25:58.658 --> 26:00.524
I'm waiting for a hearing date.

26:00.626 --> 26:04.094
It'll come up faster
than the rape case.

26:04.196 --> 26:08.365
Amy, you're doing great.
Just follow the law.

26:08.467 --> 26:11.368
What does it matter if I follow
the law when he doesn't?

26:11.470 --> 26:13.504
Eventually he has to.

26:13.606 --> 26:15.172
"Eventually."

26:17.410 --> 26:18.909
You know, the truth is,

26:19.011 --> 26:20.744
it doesn't matter
how many locks I install

26:20.846 --> 26:22.212
or how careful I am.

26:22.315 --> 26:23.847
There is no legal protection

26:23.950 --> 26:26.317
that anyone
can seem to offer me.

26:26.419 --> 26:30.120
You know that, he knows that.

26:30.222 --> 26:32.323
He isn't afraid of anything.

26:35.628 --> 26:38.429
If it was
one of your daughters...

26:38.531 --> 26:40.598
He'd already be dead.

26:44.470 --> 26:45.836
So you've been having
these cramps

26:45.938 --> 26:47.972

26:48.074 --> 26:50.407
Yeah. Is the baby okay?

26:50.509 --> 26:52.443
Perfectly fine.

26:52.545 --> 26:55.479
You, however, have a shortening
cervix that requires rest.

26:55.581 --> 26:57.448
So you'll need to avoid
all strenuous activity

26:57.550 --> 26:58.515
from here on out.

26:58.618 --> 26:59.783
Oh, no. I just got a new job.

26:59.885 --> 27:01.285
So I can't--

27:01.387 --> 27:04.755
Amy, we can't risk
a premature birth.

27:04.857 --> 27:06.690
There's no choice, I'm afraid.

27:09.061 --> 27:11.962
Now, how about we find out
the baby's gender

27:12.064 --> 27:14.098
so that you can be thinking
about names

27:14.200 --> 27:16.233

27:16.335 --> 27:19.036
-Okay.
-Okay.

Sir, like I told the detective,
I don't even know her name.

27:22.341 --> 27:24.708
The only time I met her
was at this bar I hang out at

27:24.810 --> 27:26.744
with some friends of hers
at law school.

27:26.846 --> 27:28.045
How do you know them?

27:28.147 --> 27:31.348
I run a gym where they do
a 3-D competition.

27:31.450 --> 27:33.751
It's CrossFit,
boxing and weights.

27:34.887 --> 27:37.021
It's a good thing they're smart.

27:37.123 --> 27:38.088
Why do you say that?

27:38.190 --> 27:41.125
Well, they basically flunked.

27:41.227 --> 27:43.927
I mean, they couldn't save
a fly, let alone themselves,

27:44.030 --> 27:46.730
but I passed them anyway.

27:46.832 --> 27:48.699
So you lied?

27:48.801 --> 27:52.536
[chuckles]
Look, what can I say?

27:52.638 --> 27:54.638
I'm a nice guy.

27:54.740 --> 27:57.007
Do nice guys have to tell you
they're nice guys?

27:58.978 --> 28:00.778
So you're saying you couldn't
possibly be the father,

28:00.880 --> 28:03.313
<i> that you didn't force sex</i>
<i> on Amy?</i>

28:03.416 --> 28:06.316
Like I told you,
I don't even know her.

28:07.687 --> 28:09.753
That's sad.

28:09.855 --> 28:13.557
Some women get so vindictive
when they get rejected.

28:13.659 --> 28:16.326
You rejected her?
Is that what you did?

28:17.763 --> 28:20.597
It's pretty easy
to prove paternity.

28:20.700 --> 28:23.167
Have at it.

28:23.269 --> 28:25.869
I'll only be working from home
for a few weeks

28:25.971 --> 28:27.838
and I can phone in
to all of the meetings.

28:27.940 --> 28:29.406
I'm not the only single
working mother out there.

28:29.508 --> 28:31.208
I know you also said that you--

28:31.310 --> 28:32.843
But I wasn't pregnant
from a rape,

28:32.945 --> 28:36.146
starting a new job
straight out of law school.

28:36.248 --> 28:38.348
A police detective
came here today

28:38.451 --> 28:41.285
looking to corroborate this was
your place of employment.

28:41.387 --> 28:42.720
Why didn't you tell us?

28:42.822 --> 28:45.189
It's not relevant
to what I do here.

28:45.291 --> 28:48.125
It didn't feel like it was
an appropriate thing to share.

28:48.227 --> 28:50.794
I feel like
I have more than delivered...

28:50.896 --> 28:54.565
Yes, so far you have,
a-and I admire your fortitude,

28:54.667 --> 28:57.835
but I'm a little concerned how
you're gonna continue to do so

28:57.937 --> 29:00.838
with a high-risk pregnancy
and a court case ahead.

29:00.940 --> 29:03.440

share all the decisions

to have his name.

50:13.478 --> 50:15.578
Hey.

50:15.680 --> 50:18.381
-I thought you had work.
-I have a friend.

50:18.483 --> 50:20.516
He bought himself a team.

50:20.618 --> 50:22.952
They look like a bunch
of fancy birds on a wire.

50:23.054 --> 50:25.254
At least you don't actually have
to see that bastard.

50:25.356 --> 50:26.589
That's the one good thing
he did,

50:26.691 --> 50:28.924
have the decency to stay
in North Carolina.

50:30.628 --> 50:33.629
Hey, you got this.

50:33.731 --> 50:36.465
<i>(bailiff)</i>
<i>All rise</i>
<i>for the honorable Judge Bonner.</i>

50:43.241 --> 50:44.640
Please be seated.

50:46.544 --> 50:49.845
We're here to establish
Mr. Demetri Hogan's paternity.

50:49.947 --> 50:52.348
Mr. Hogan, counsel informs me
they are representing you

50:52.450 --> 50:53.949
for the State of Georgia

50:54.052 --> 50:55.918
and you presently live
in North Carolina.

50:56.020 --> 50:57.286
<i> Is this correct?</i>

50:57.388 --> 50:58.421
<i> (Demetri on phone)</i>
<i> Yes, Your Honor.</i>

50:58.523 --> 51:01.524
<i> [intense music]</i>

51:10.201 --> 51:12.334
I'm the best you'll ever have.

51:13.971 --> 51:15.638
[breathing heavily]

51:25.116 --> 51:27.817
<i>(Judge Bonner)</i>
<i>And we have</i>
<i>Mr. Hogan's counsel Ms. Wallace</i>

51:27.919 --> 51:30.953
<i> and Mr. Rosemead,</i>
<i> his personal investigator.</i>

51:31.055 --> 51:34.323
Ms. Thompson,
you're representing yourself?

51:35.293 --> 51:36.525
Yes, Your Honor.

51:36.627 --> 51:38.494
You know the court does not
advise it.

51:38.596 --> 51:39.962
I do, Your Honor.

51:41.699 --> 51:44.667
I've read petitioners'
and respondents' statements.

51:44.769 --> 51:48.037
As this hearing is to establish
Mr. Hogan's paternal rights,

51:48.139 --> 51:50.639
I'll ask his counsel to proceed
with any new statements.

51:50.741 --> 51:52.475
Mr. Hogan's message
has been clear

51:52.577 --> 51:55.544
since he hired Mr. Rosemead,
who helped him to discover

51:55.646 --> 51:58.881
that he fathered a child
almost seven years ago.

51:58.983 --> 52:02.418
He simply wants an opportunity
to be a loving father

52:02.520 --> 52:04.954
to the child that he's purposely
been kept away

52:05.056 --> 52:05.921
from by the mother.

52:06.023 --> 52:07.389
Your Honor, that's a lie.

52:07.492 --> 52:10.793
Mr. Hogan found out
I was pregnant from a detective.

52:10.895 --> 52:12.661
I filed a restraining order
against him

52:12.763 --> 52:14.096
after he raped me
in North Carolina.

52:14.198 --> 52:15.931
Ms. Wallace was his attorney
then, too.

52:16.033 --> 52:17.600
Objection, Your Honor.

52:17.702 --> 52:19.068
Are you going to allow
Ms. Thompson

52:19.170 --> 52:20.970
to randomly interject like this?

52:21.072 --> 52:23.305
Ms. Thompson,
please approach the bench.

52:29.113 --> 52:32.314
This is family court,
not criminal court.

52:32.416 --> 52:33.315
Yes, Your Honor.

52:33.417 --> 52:34.617
And are you aware of any law

52:34.719 --> 52:37.486
to prohibit this action
from the child's father?

52:37.588 --> 52:39.889
No, Your Honor,
not in the state of Georgia.

52:39.991 --> 52:42.024
And no federal law, correct?

52:43.294 --> 52:45.327
-No, Your Honor.
-In which case--

52:45.429 --> 52:47.530
-But I'm working on it.
-Well, you'd best hurry.

52:47.632 --> 52:50.266
State law
is scarce and inconsistent.

52:50.368 --> 52:52.067
I'm bound by the law,
Ms. Thompson.

52:52.170 --> 52:54.036
Laws that keep
mothers and children

52:54.138 --> 52:56.505
tethered to the rapist?

52:56.607 --> 52:58.974
Under the law,
I'm compelled to believe

52:59.076 --> 53:00.976
both parents capable...

53:02.513 --> 53:04.580
unless I'm convinced otherwise.

53:07.285 --> 53:09.919
Maybe you'd like to consider
getting some help?

53:11.856 --> 53:13.355
You may be seated.

53:16.093 --> 53:17.660
<i> Before we proceed,</i>
<i> I'd like to order</i>

53:17.762 --> 53:19.929
a paternity test for Mr. Hogan.

53:20.031 --> 53:22.097
<i> Based on that,</i>
<i> we will set hearings.</i>

53:22.200 --> 53:24.533
<i> Court stands adjourned</i>
<i> for the day.</i>

53:24.635 --> 53:25.534
Excuse me,
I just want to talk to her.

53:25.636 --> 53:26.735
He sounded like Darth Vader

53:26.837 --> 53:28.504
through that
stupid speaker phone.

53:28.606 --> 53:30.606
Excuse me, Ms. Thompson.

53:30.708 --> 53:31.740
Bob Moss.

53:31.842 --> 53:32.908
I was watching the proceedings

53:33.010 --> 53:34.610
and I'd like to offer
my assistance.

53:34.712 --> 53:36.111
Thank you very much,
I'm defending myself.

53:36.214 --> 53:39.048
Ah, court kind of prefers
that you have an attorney.

53:39.150 --> 53:43.085
I-I know this judge really well,
and I'd do it pro-bono.

53:44.555 --> 53:45.754
You know, you just...

53:45.856 --> 53:48.524
You can think of me as a...
I got 'em here.

53:48.626 --> 53:51.160
A hard-working sandbag for you.

53:51.262 --> 53:53.495
And, um, for the record,

53:53.598 --> 53:56.398
I, I think what you're going
through here is, it's appalling.

53:56.500 --> 53:58.500
<i> [instrumental music]</i>

53:59.770 --> 54:01.403
He seems nice.

54:10.448 --> 54:13.449
<i> [intense music]</i>

54:18.155 --> 54:19.989
Hello.

54:20.091 --> 54:21.890
Afternoon, gentlemen.

54:21.993 --> 54:25.127
-Can I help you, sir?
-I'm just waiting on someone.

54:25.229 --> 54:26.262
If you don't have a child here,

54:26.364 --> 54:28.097
you shouldn't be
on the property,

54:28.199 --> 54:29.732
unless you signed in
at the office.

54:29.834 --> 54:31.834
Now, there's a protocol in place
for all visitors.

54:31.936 --> 54:35.104
-It's to keep everyone safe.
-Maybe I do have a child here.

54:35.206 --> 54:36.939
What's your child's name?

54:37.041 --> 54:39.775
You know, I'm not a visitor.
I'm a father.

54:41.479 --> 54:45.514
I don't have to prove anything
to you. It's my right.

54:45.616 --> 54:47.049
<i> [engine starts]</i>

54:51.822 --> 54:55.190
Notify the cops about this guy.

54:55.293 --> 54:57.159
They can't do anything
unless he does something.

54:57.261 --> 54:58.761
Yeah, do it anyway.

55:01.165 --> 55:03.198
You think
he's really got a kid here?

55:03.301 --> 55:05.167
I wouldn't trust him with one
if he does.

55:05.269 --> 55:06.468
<i> -Junbi!</i>
-Ah!

55:06.570 --> 55:08.304
Right foot back,
fighting stance, go!

55:08.406 --> 55:09.938
-Ah!
-Center punch, go!

55:10.041 --> 55:11.140
-Ah!
-Go!

55:11.242 --> 55:15.978
-Ah!
-Remember, Chi lives inside us.

55:16.080 --> 55:18.147
Chi is the life force

55:18.249 --> 55:20.916
that flows through all things.

55:21.018 --> 55:24.219
-Can you feel the Chi, class?
-Yes,<i> sensei.</i>

55:24.322 --> 55:27.356
This guy's the real deal.
Our whole family takes a class.

55:27.458 --> 55:29.825
Worth every penny
for the peace of mind.

55:29.927 --> 55:31.827
<i> McDevitt is our Shihan Sensei.</i>

55:31.929 --> 55:34.263
Word is, he was one of the best
State Troopers back in the day.

55:34.365 --> 55:37.533
Remember the practice continues
outside of the dojo.

55:37.635 --> 55:39.802
Does he ever do private lessons?

55:39.904 --> 55:42.137
Sometimes. He's very particular.

55:42.239 --> 55:44.907
You have to write a request,
old-school style.

55:45.009 --> 55:46.709
He decides if you're worthy.

55:46.811 --> 55:48.744
<i> (McDevitt)</i>
<i> The dojo exists</i>
<i> because of the meaning</i>

55:48.846 --> 55:50.346
<i> we give it!</i>

55:50.448 --> 55:52.081
<i> (instructor)</i>
<i> Class, please be seated.</i>

55:57.288 --> 55:59.221
Ah, that's your daughter?

55:59.323 --> 56:02.291
-Yes, yeah, it is.
-Cool, good for her.

56:02.393 --> 56:03.659
You know, when I was nine,
I was on the cover

56:03.761 --> 56:05.060
of "Black Belt" magazine.

56:05.162 --> 56:07.229
-Hm.
-Yeah.

56:07.331 --> 56:09.231
So these are, this is
the paperwork that you needed

56:09.333 --> 56:10.366
for Maddy's school
for the judge.

56:10.468 --> 56:12.334
Oh, yes. Thank you. Um...

56:12.436 --> 56:15.270
I hate to bother you in the
middle of family time what not,

56:15.373 --> 56:18.073
but, um, we're gonna need
another deposition

56:18.175 --> 56:21.210
from someone that has
any knowledge of your case.

56:21.312 --> 56:22.544
Uh, Letty and Chickie
weren't enough?

56:22.646 --> 56:24.113
Uh, no, no, no.
They're, they're fine.

56:24.215 --> 56:26.014
It's just that, you know,
the posing attorneys,

56:26.117 --> 56:28.117
they're gonna try to discover
any inaccuracies

56:28.219 --> 56:29.418
in your version of events

56:29.520 --> 56:31.353
so that they can,
you know, settle this

56:31.455 --> 56:32.855
before we even get to court.

56:32.957 --> 56:34.990
Uh, so is there anybody
who can depose?

56:35.092 --> 56:37.192
Anybody else we can depose
that, you know,

56:37.294 --> 56:41.196
knows what happened and-and
can approach themselves?

56:41.298 --> 56:43.031
You know, it might have been
nice to be warned

56:43.134 --> 56:44.666
that I was gonna be disposed.

56:44.769 --> 56:48.103
-Deposed, mom.
-Po-tay-to, po-tah-to.

56:48.205 --> 56:49.738
Well, I thought
everything was gonna be done

56:49.840 --> 56:51.573
over the phone, so...

56:51.675 --> 56:52.708
Well, I guess
that's not the first thing

56:52.810 --> 56:54.877
you've been wrong about,

56:54.979 --> 56:58.781
along with
that airline knock-off suit.

56:58.883 --> 57:01.750
I mean, do you just
purposely wear stuff like that

57:01.852 --> 57:04.720
so men won't give you
a second look?

57:04.822 --> 57:07.523
No wonder you're still single.

57:07.625 --> 57:10.626
Have I not taught you anything?

57:10.728 --> 57:13.429
You've taught me
more than you know.

57:13.531 --> 57:16.064
Well, don't worry,
I'm not stickin' around.

57:16.167 --> 57:18.033
As soon as I answer
these boring questions,

57:18.135 --> 57:19.468
I'm on my way.

57:19.570 --> 57:22.304
Thank you for doing this.
I appreciate it.

57:22.406 --> 57:24.339
I didn't exactly have a choice.

57:25.509 --> 57:27.009
I just think this is ridiculous

57:27.111 --> 57:28.210
that you have to fight this,

57:28.312 --> 57:32.214
this rapist for custody.

57:33.851 --> 57:36.785
You should've, you should've
never moved to Georgia.

57:36.887 --> 57:39.188
Those damn
backwoods hillbillies...

57:41.759 --> 57:43.091
So how is she?

57:43.194 --> 57:44.393
Maddy?

57:46.163 --> 57:49.198
She's very sweet. Happy.

57:49.300 --> 57:51.400
Does she look
anything like him?

57:53.103 --> 57:55.137
No, mom.

57:55.239 --> 57:56.972
She looks like you.

57:58.142 --> 58:01.910
Why, Lord!
What a beautiful angel!

58:03.747 --> 58:05.747
I would love to meet her.

58:07.585 --> 58:10.419
Do you think you could ever
change your mind?

58:14.992 --> 58:16.291
-Look...
-I could...

58:16.393 --> 58:19.094
I could help you
make some money with her.

58:19.196 --> 58:22.231
Well, I was modeling
at that age, winnin' pageants,

58:22.333 --> 58:24.967
I was puttin' food on the table
so my mama didn't have to worry

58:25.069 --> 58:28.103
so much. I was glad to help.

58:28.205 --> 58:31.907
As much as some might
judge my world, I was happy.

58:32.009 --> 58:33.942
My daughter is happy.

58:35.980 --> 58:37.246
Well...

58:39.049 --> 58:40.782
Why don't you treat yourself?

58:40.885 --> 58:42.985
Come on. Take it.
Both-both of you.

58:45.155 --> 58:48.624
Or maybe you could pay
some of these court fees,

58:48.726 --> 58:50.692
all these added expenses.

58:53.664 --> 58:56.198
Didn't I say
this was gonna drag on?

58:56.300 --> 58:58.901
You've said a lot of things,

58:59.003 --> 59:02.771
most of them
ignorant and selfish.

59:02.873 --> 59:06.775
God, I took it for so long.
I'm done.

59:06.877 --> 59:09.811
I will never listen to your
toxic bull.... ever again,

59:09.914 --> 59:12.948
and neither will my daughter.

59:13.851 --> 59:15.450
That makes me happy.

59:15.553 --> 59:17.252
Can I get you some coffee
while we're waiting

59:17.354 --> 59:18.754
for the defense team to arrive?

59:18.856 --> 59:20.822
I'm sure she'll have some.

59:20.925 --> 59:23.025
She likes it on the bitter side.

59:25.396 --> 59:26.461
[grunts]

59:27.364 --> 59:30.265
[grunting]

59:34.538 --> 59:35.637
Hm.

59:38.342 --> 59:40.876
-Mr. McDevitt.
-Oh.

59:40.978 --> 59:43.879
So I had to read your request
a few times.

59:43.981 --> 59:48.216
You've got yourself a situation
and no time to waste.

59:48.319 --> 59:50.085
-Yes, sir.
-Here's the good news.

59:50.187 --> 59:54.456
I'm not a lawyer,
judge or a cop anymore.

59:55.926 --> 59:58.260
Therefore,
I might actually be useful.

59:58.362 --> 1:00:02.230
Now, before we get
into the physical,

1:00:02.333 --> 1:00:05.701
we must examine why someone
has waged war against us.

1:00:05.803 --> 1:00:08.971
Yes. Why after all these years?

1:00:09.073 --> 1:00:13.075
All about power and control.

1:00:13.177 --> 1:00:16.545
Just like rape.
The answer's simple.

1:00:16.647 --> 1:00:19.848
- To get back at you, the enemy.
- For what?

1:00:19.950 --> 1:00:22.551
He's what you call
a malignant narcissist.

1:00:22.653 --> 1:00:24.252
It's never their responsibility.

1:00:24.355 --> 1:00:27.189
'Cause you filed
criminal charges against him,

1:00:27.291 --> 1:00:29.358
life has fallen apart
these past years.

1:00:29.460 --> 1:00:32.628
And now he's claiming
the child as property.

1:00:32.730 --> 1:00:36.231
Let me ask you. Are you ready
to form a counter attack?

1:00:36.333 --> 1:00:40.302
I'm afraid of my anger
imprinting onto my daughter.

1:00:40.404 --> 1:00:42.604
Fear imprints
onto children, too.

1:00:42.706 --> 1:00:44.573
It's contagious, not to mention

1:00:44.675 --> 1:00:47.009
that permanent kink in your neck

1:00:47.111 --> 1:00:48.410
from always lookin' behind you.

1:00:48.512 --> 1:00:49.978
So what do I do?

1:00:50.080 --> 1:00:54.249
I'm talking about
finding his weakness

1:00:54.351 --> 1:00:58.053
and creating an opportunity
for yourself to win

1:00:58.155 --> 1:00:59.888
once and for all.

Your Honor,
Georgia law is very clear.

1:09:37.240 --> 1:09:39.908
There is no legislation

<i> from claiming parental rights</i>
<i> of a child.</i>

1:09:42.646 --> 1:09:45.446

to pursue custody

to have that baby,

you kept me in your life
forever, and hers.

1:12:21.404 --> 1:12:25.506
You raped me.

No, Your Honor.

in place to protect me,

my child from this violent man.
