WEBVTT

00:03.067 --> 00:05.101
So, when are
the girls coming back?

00:05.102 --> 00:08.004
Not for another half hour.

00:08.005 --> 00:09.539
They did the hot yoga today?

00:09.540 --> 00:11.374
No, that's on Wednesdays.

00:11.375 --> 00:13.042
Today is Vinyasa yoga.

00:13.043 --> 00:14.611
It's less about sweat and more

00:14.612 --> 00:16.613
about the flow of movement.

00:16.614 --> 00:17.647
It's the key to everything.

00:17.648 --> 00:18.615
You got to keep moving.

00:18.616 --> 00:20.849
Ain't that the truth?

00:22.318 --> 00:23.318
You're back early.

00:23.320 --> 00:26.255
Something awful happened.

00:26.257 --> 00:27.390
Hey, don't feel bad.

00:27.391 --> 00:28.725
They shouldn't have you
bending and squatting

00:28.726 --> 00:30.726
in a room that quiet.

00:30.728 --> 00:31.861
No.

00:31.862 --> 00:33.428
Our instructor died.

00:33.430 --> 00:34.497
Seriously?

00:34.498 --> 00:35.864
Right in the middle of class.

00:35.866 --> 00:37.600
Kara was teaching us Tree Pose

00:37.601 --> 00:40.103
when she went down
like a redwood.

00:40.104 --> 00:41.070
As she was falling,

00:41.071 --> 00:42.171
some clown in
the back of the room

00:42.172 --> 00:43.239
yelled out, "Timber""

00:43.240 --> 00:46.441
I didn't know she was dead,
all right?

00:46.443 --> 00:48.110
I just still can't believe it.

00:48.111 --> 00:50.445
I've been taking her class
for ten years.

00:50.447 --> 00:51.447
That's terrible.

00:51.448 --> 00:52.647
Well, was she an older broad?

00:52.649 --> 00:55.016
She was three years
younger than me.

00:55.018 --> 00:57.018
Eh.

00:58.187 --> 00:59.822
Too young.

00:59.823 --> 01:01.356
Way too young.

01:02.892 --> 01:04.060
Gah, it's crazy.

01:04.061 --> 01:05.594
I mean, she-she was a vegan,

01:05.595 --> 01:07.563
worked out every day,
didn't smoke, didn't drink...

01:07.564 --> 01:08.531
Didn't shave.

01:08.532 --> 01:09.999
Let's just say
her final Tree Pose

01:10.000 --> 01:12.967
had a couple of nests in it.

01:12.969 --> 01:14.670
So, uh, how you doing?

01:14.671 --> 01:15.604
And if it helps,

01:15.605 --> 01:17.373
I-I thought "timber" was funny.

01:17.374 --> 01:18.307
Thank you.

01:18.308 --> 01:19.575
It just makes you realize

01:19.576 --> 01:21.610
that you got to make
every moment count.

01:21.611 --> 01:22.778
You have to really appreciate

01:22.779 --> 01:24.712
the people you love
in this world.

01:24.714 --> 01:26.048
Yeah.

01:26.049 --> 01:27.049
So, you want to go upstairs?

01:27.050 --> 01:28.651
Ew, no, Mike!

01:28.652 --> 01:30.219
Okay, I misread the signal.

01:30.220 --> 01:31.386
Namaste.

02:03.724 --> 02:07.327
Boy, I just can't get over
what happened yesterday.

02:07.328 --> 02:08.762
I know, neither can I.

02:08.763 --> 02:09.862
And the more I think about it,

02:09.864 --> 02:11.665
the more I have to wonder...

02:11.666 --> 02:15.167
shouldn't that yoga studio
give us a refund for that class?

02:15.169 --> 02:18.304
Victoria, the woman just died.

02:18.306 --> 02:20.573
So, I should call in a few days?

02:20.575 --> 02:23.776
Well, that's what I'm doing.

02:23.778 --> 02:24.845
Hey.

02:24.846 --> 02:25.779
How'd you sleep?

02:25.780 --> 02:27.347
I didn't.

02:27.348 --> 02:28.815
Here.

02:28.816 --> 02:30.116
Stickers?
Yeah.

02:30.118 --> 02:31.550
You each have your own color.

02:31.552 --> 02:33.519
I want you both to
go through the house

02:33.521 --> 02:35.754
and mark anything
you want after I die.

02:35.756 --> 02:37.524
What?

02:37.525 --> 02:39.225
Look, it's the best way
to divide my stuff up,

02:39.227 --> 02:41.094
and that way
you can kickback, relax,

02:41.095 --> 02:42.895
and enjoy the funeral I planned.

02:42.897 --> 02:44.431
There's gonna be a calypso band.

02:44.432 --> 02:46.765
Okay, we're not doing this.

02:46.767 --> 02:47.901
Well, why not?

02:47.902 --> 02:49.269
Because no one is dying.

02:49.270 --> 02:50.903
You're perfectly healthy, Mom.

02:50.905 --> 02:52.572
Yeah, so was Kara,

02:52.573 --> 02:54.274
and she went
downward-facing dead,

02:54.275 --> 02:55.308
right in front of us.

02:55.309 --> 02:57.876
Eight minutes into a $30 class.

02:59.412 --> 03:01.547
Come on, it'll be a fun game.

03:01.549 --> 03:03.216
I'll set the timer
for 20 minutes,

03:03.217 --> 03:05.651
and you each get one steal.

03:05.653 --> 03:06.886
No.

03:06.887 --> 03:08.922
Victoria and I are not
picking through your things

03:08.923 --> 03:10.456
like a couple of vultures.

03:10.457 --> 03:12.991
Are earrings one sticker or two?

03:14.827 --> 03:17.262
Two, they should be two.

03:22.368 --> 03:25.238
Apparently this woman
ate healthy, she exercised,

03:25.239 --> 03:27.406
and it still didn't do
a damn bit of good.

03:27.408 --> 03:29.609
I mean, there has got to be
a lesson in there somewhere.

03:29.610 --> 03:30.976
I'll have an apple fritter.

03:32.311 --> 03:33.979
Uh, no, he will not.

03:33.981 --> 03:35.148
Yes, I will.

03:35.149 --> 03:36.248
Not on my watch.

03:36.250 --> 03:38.617
Then close your eyes.

03:38.619 --> 03:40.286
All right, Samuel,

03:40.287 --> 03:41.753
bring him his
deep-fried death warrant.

03:41.755 --> 03:45.758
That warrant was signed
long before I got here.

03:45.759 --> 03:46.859
I can't believe you.

03:46.860 --> 03:47.860
Every time some health nut dies,

03:47.861 --> 03:49.061
you take it as a starter pistol

03:49.062 --> 03:50.729
to stuff your face.

03:50.731 --> 03:52.631
Have you not heard a word
I said?

03:52.632 --> 03:54.867
When your number is up,
your number is up,

03:54.868 --> 03:59.104
and I am not going to
go hungry into that good night.

03:59.106 --> 04:00.673
So, it's all luck?

04:00.674 --> 04:02.440
Diet and exercise have nothing
to do with it?

04:02.442 --> 04:04.810
You remember
my old, Greek landlady,

04:04.811 --> 04:08.914
Mrs. Something-dopo-dopolous,
okay?

04:08.915 --> 04:10.783
She lived to be 103, okay?

04:10.784 --> 04:12.518
The only time she took
her cigarette out of her mouth

04:12.519 --> 04:14.552
was to take a swig of ouzo.

04:14.554 --> 04:16.188
Yeah, but look what
it did to her.

04:16.189 --> 04:19.923
Her face looked like a Fruit
Roll-Up with a mustache.

04:19.926 --> 04:25.564
The point is, okay,
she lived life on her terms.

04:25.565 --> 04:26.865
Died with a smile on her face,

04:26.866 --> 04:29.667
and a cigarette
in her throat hole.

04:30.502 --> 04:31.570
Come on, don't do it, Mike.

04:31.571 --> 04:32.838
You know in your gut
that it's wrong.

04:32.839 --> 04:33.939
Are you kidding?

04:33.940 --> 04:36.307
My gut's been planning this
for weeks.

04:36.309 --> 04:38.377
Well, just know
that every fritter that you eat,

04:38.378 --> 04:40.012
that's gonna be less time
with your beautiful wife

04:40.013 --> 04:41.079
and your future children.

04:42.582 --> 04:47.119
Tell us about our daddy, Uncle Carl.

04:47.120 --> 04:49.755
Did he love us?

04:49.756 --> 04:50.956
Oh, yes, child.

04:50.957 --> 04:53.657
Almost as much
as he loved fritters.

04:55.360 --> 04:56.895
Well, why do all
my unborn children

04:56.896 --> 04:58.896
sound like Michael Jackson?

04:58.898 --> 05:02.367
'Cause you weren't around
to raise them right.

05:02.368 --> 05:03.869
Yeah, they had to rely
on the numerous lovers

05:03.870 --> 05:05.504
that Molly took...
in her grief...

05:05.505 --> 05:07.505
after your death.

05:08.340 --> 05:09.540
One apple fritter,

05:09.542 --> 05:13.477
served without
judgment or liability.

05:21.519 --> 05:23.988
All right, but I'm gonna
spend those extra years

05:23.989 --> 05:26.857
making your life miserable.

05:26.859 --> 05:28.792
You won't regret it.

05:32.163 --> 05:33.697
Although you would
have died happy...

05:33.699 --> 05:35.365
Ah!

05:40.472 --> 05:43.508
Hey, who's banging
around down here?

05:43.509 --> 05:45.176
Me.

05:45.177 --> 05:46.477
You finally making that still

05:46.478 --> 05:48.313
you've been
threatening to build?

05:48.314 --> 05:50.481
No, I'm trying to get
into this damn thing.

05:50.482 --> 05:51.849
Well, don't you have a key?

05:51.850 --> 05:53.150
Yeah.

05:53.152 --> 05:55.820
I just thought it would be
more fun to spend 20 minutes

05:55.821 --> 05:57.955
trying to open it
with a freaking hammer.

05:57.956 --> 05:59.824
All right, don't sass me.

05:59.825 --> 06:01.292
Give me the hammer.

06:01.293 --> 06:02.527
What's in here, anyway?

06:02.528 --> 06:04.161
Ugh, who can remember?

06:04.163 --> 06:05.763
Old savings bonds?

06:05.764 --> 06:07.732
Insurance policy?

06:07.733 --> 06:11.102
It's just one stupid piece
of the jigsaw puzzle

06:11.103 --> 06:12.236
that is my life.

06:12.237 --> 06:13.404
Well, you don't have to sort

06:13.405 --> 06:14.604
through all this stuff now.

06:14.606 --> 06:15.640
Yes, I do.

06:15.641 --> 06:17.508
You have no idea how hard things

06:17.509 --> 06:19.075
are gonna be when I'm gone.

06:19.077 --> 06:20.478
I got to be honest.

06:20.479 --> 06:23.113
Things aren't that easy
when you're here.

06:23.115 --> 06:26.617
I was completely blindsided
when your father died.

06:26.618 --> 06:28.986
Gah, I had to plan a funeral,

06:28.987 --> 06:31.756
figure out bank accounts, bills,

06:31.757 --> 06:34.525
all while balling my eyes out.

06:34.526 --> 06:37.494
I don't want you girls
to have to go through all that.

06:37.496 --> 06:39.696
Okay.

06:41.465 --> 06:42.633
So, it's decided.

06:42.634 --> 06:44.767
You'll live forever.

06:44.769 --> 06:47.837
I'll see what I can do.

06:47.839 --> 06:50.874
All right,
let's crack this clam open.

06:50.875 --> 06:52.443
See what kind of legacy

06:52.444 --> 06:54.278
you're leaving us.

06:54.279 --> 06:55.312
Oh.

06:55.313 --> 06:56.547
Hey.

06:56.548 --> 06:58.882
Oh, Polaroids?

06:58.883 --> 07:02.352
Ugh.

07:09.660 --> 07:13.963
Boy, your father sure
knew how to frame a shot.

07:20.337 --> 07:22.072
Boy, it feels weird
being in a lawyer's office

07:22.073 --> 07:25.108
without a bottle
of clean urine in my purse.

07:25.109 --> 07:27.010
Yeah, if you're gonna
keep those in the fridge,

07:27.011 --> 07:30.146
could you please label them?

07:30.148 --> 07:32.082
Just so you know, once
we finish with the will,

07:32.083 --> 07:34.083
there's just a few loose
ends we got to tie up.

07:34.085 --> 07:36.386
Power of attorney,
end of life issues.

07:36.387 --> 07:38.587
Mainly, which one of you
is gonna pull the plug.

07:38.589 --> 07:40.257
Mom, neither one of us
is gonna pull the plug...

07:40.258 --> 07:41.424
I'll do it.

07:41.425 --> 07:43.259
Victoria.

07:44.160 --> 07:46.229
Nobody is going
to pull the plug.

07:46.230 --> 07:48.964
She's our mother,
not your curling iron.

07:48.966 --> 07:50.367
I guess just
working with the dead

07:50.368 --> 07:53.269
makes me more comfortable with,
like, getting them there.

07:53.270 --> 07:56.105
Mama's little Kevorkian.

07:57.307 --> 08:00.609
So, that's settled,
you'll kill Mom?

08:00.611 --> 08:02.378
But we should come up
with a safe word,

08:02.379 --> 08:03.712
so I know when to do it.

08:03.714 --> 08:06.682
If I'm saying words,
don't do it.

08:08.785 --> 08:11.386
And, Molly,
before we go in there,

08:11.388 --> 08:13.188
there's something
I want you to have,

08:13.190 --> 08:14.990
and I don't want an argument.

08:14.992 --> 08:17.393
I told you I didn't want
to do this when...

08:17.394 --> 08:18.393
Oh, ooh!

08:18.395 --> 08:20.595
Grandma's ring!

08:22.198 --> 08:24.767
You two always had a special bond,
Ah...

08:24.768 --> 08:26.435
and I know she'd want you
to have it.

08:26.437 --> 08:28.638
Oh, I don't know what to say.

08:28.639 --> 08:30.273
Just say you'll keep it.

08:30.274 --> 08:32.808
Of course, forever.

08:32.809 --> 08:34.376
Thank you.

08:34.378 --> 08:37.379
Oh, and Victoria,
you're getting the house.

08:37.381 --> 08:38.647
Okay.
What?

08:40.000 --> 08:46.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:53.408 --> 08:55.676
What do you think
happens when we die?

08:55.677 --> 08:56.677
It's fourth and goal.

08:56.678 --> 08:58.545
Can this wait?

08:58.546 --> 08:59.546
You know what,

08:59.547 --> 09:01.114
remind me to never be vulnerable

09:01.115 --> 09:03.315
in front of you again.

09:07.754 --> 09:09.689
All right, fine.

09:09.690 --> 09:11.891
What's bothering you, princess?

09:14.227 --> 09:16.763
Do you believe in heaven?

09:16.764 --> 09:18.397
I believe that there's a quiet,

09:18.399 --> 09:20.266
peaceful place that we all go,

09:20.267 --> 09:23.003
and today I was hoping
that was the living room.

09:23.004 --> 09:24.104
Sorry.

09:24.105 --> 09:25.905
It's just
that last night in bed,

09:25.906 --> 09:27.707
Joyce told me
she didn't believe.

09:27.708 --> 09:29.042
Threw me for a loop.

09:29.043 --> 09:32.311
Could have knocked me over
with the feather we were using.

09:33.580 --> 09:34.981
You know when you tell me
these things,

09:34.982 --> 09:38.218
I can't look at Joyce
for three days, right?

09:38.219 --> 09:40.053
It's not like
I'm a religious man.

09:40.054 --> 09:43.523
I'm just saying, why not pretend
to believe, just in case?

09:43.524 --> 09:44.923
Hedge your bets.

09:46.484 --> 09:50.086
Well, don't you think that God
knows if you're full of crap?

09:50.088 --> 09:54.157
I don't know, I think he would
appreciate that I got a system.

09:54.159 --> 09:57.495
Well, I guess when
I think about it, I mean,

09:57.496 --> 09:58.762
I do rub the Buddha's belly

09:58.763 --> 10:01.364
when I leave
a Chinese restaurant.

10:01.366 --> 10:03.867
I even tried on a yarmulke
once at a flea market.

10:03.868 --> 10:05.002
Not a good look on me.

10:05.003 --> 10:07.537
I need a hat with a bill.

10:07.539 --> 10:08.638
Hello.

10:08.640 --> 10:09.506
Victoria.

10:09.507 --> 10:10.206
Hey.

10:10.208 --> 10:12.008
Joyce.

10:14.812 --> 10:16.113
Guess who Mom's
leaving the house to,

10:16.114 --> 10:17.114
and I'll give you a hint.

10:17.115 --> 10:18.981
I'm getting a stupid ring!

10:20.017 --> 10:22.718
Listen, I don't have to
justify my decision to you.

10:22.720 --> 10:24.688
Because you can't; it's lunacy.

10:24.689 --> 10:27.324
Wait a minute,
what does she have on you?

10:27.325 --> 10:29.126
I don't know what I have on her,

10:29.127 --> 10:31.727
but I know what
I'm getting from her.

10:31.729 --> 10:33.130
Yeah?

10:33.131 --> 10:34.131
Meet me in the driveway.

10:34.132 --> 10:35.231
I got something for you, too.

10:35.233 --> 10:37.234
Hey, hey, hey, stop fighting.

10:37.235 --> 10:39.402
Look, it's my decision,
so deal with it.

10:39.404 --> 10:41.370
Come on, Mom,
let's go to the kitchen.

10:41.372 --> 10:43.306
Let her cool off.

10:43.307 --> 10:44.541
Just so that there's
no confusion,

10:44.542 --> 10:47.443
are the appliances
coming with the house?

10:47.445 --> 10:49.146
Yeah, it comes
with the driveway, too.

10:49.147 --> 10:51.314
I'll meet you there
in ten minutes!

10:51.315 --> 10:53.049
Now's probably not the time,

10:53.050 --> 10:54.718
but I thought I was
getting that ring.

10:54.719 --> 10:55.819
What?

10:55.820 --> 10:58.020
Whoa!

11:03.927 --> 11:06.061
No, no, no, no.

11:14.003 --> 11:15.838
All right, come on, don't...

11:19.709 --> 11:22.579
If this is my mom's way
of making me pull that plug,

11:22.580 --> 11:25.380
I'm gonna yank that cord
like I'm starting a lawn mower.

11:27.417 --> 11:28.984
Well, maybe
your mom figured that,

11:28.986 --> 11:30.753
you know, since we're
getting my mom's house,

11:30.754 --> 11:31.920
you don't need two.

11:31.922 --> 11:35.457
She knows I'm never gonna
live in that hell hole.

11:35.459 --> 11:37.527
Hey, that was my childhood home.

11:37.528 --> 11:39.127
I got a lot of
good memories there.

11:39.129 --> 11:40.863
Name one.

11:40.864 --> 11:43.865
All right, you made your point.

11:43.867 --> 11:45.935
It just doesn't make any sense.

11:45.936 --> 11:47.469
I was always the good daughter.

11:47.471 --> 11:48.871
I mean, I was home by curfew.

11:48.872 --> 11:49.872
I got straight A's.

11:49.873 --> 11:52.040
I was captain
of the color guard.

11:53.843 --> 11:56.845
You don't still have
that uniform, do you?

11:58.648 --> 12:01.983
It was-it was itchy
wool pants and a poncho.

12:03.786 --> 12:06.554
What color was the poncho?

12:08.424 --> 12:09.924
Ick.

12:13.796 --> 12:14.897
I don't know.

12:14.898 --> 12:17.332
I mean, Victoria was
always way worse than I was.

12:17.334 --> 12:19.602
I mean, she was out all night,
crazy boyfriends, drugs.

12:19.603 --> 12:22.104
One time a guy
crawling out of her window

12:22.105 --> 12:23.439
bumped into a guy crawling in.

12:23.440 --> 12:26.574
They-they got in a fistfight
right there on the roof.

12:26.576 --> 12:28.444
Look, I get what you're
saying about your mom.

12:28.445 --> 12:29.612
It doesn't make any sense.

12:29.613 --> 12:31.180
It's almost like she's rewarding

12:31.181 --> 12:33.481
Victoria for being a screw-up.

12:35.551 --> 12:36.585
Oh...

12:36.586 --> 12:38.187
my...
Ow.

12:38.188 --> 12:39.188
Yes.

12:39.189 --> 12:40.823
That's it.

12:40.824 --> 12:42.424
That's it!

12:42.425 --> 12:43.892
That is exactly why

12:43.893 --> 12:45.894
my mom is giving
the house to Victoria.

12:45.895 --> 12:48.297
Oh, she's a screw-up.

12:48.298 --> 12:49.898
Oh, my...

12:49.899 --> 12:51.100
You know, my mom knows

12:51.101 --> 12:52.734
that she might not be there
to bail her out,

12:52.735 --> 12:55.170
but at least Ding-Dong
will have a place to live.

12:55.171 --> 12:56.504
Yeah.

12:57.339 --> 12:58.673
You think?

12:59.541 --> 13:00.842
What else could it be?

13:00.843 --> 13:02.044
I mean, look at me.

13:03.413 --> 13:06.281
I'm a smart, strong,
independent woman.

13:06.282 --> 13:08.824
I mean, I've kind of
got it all together.

13:11.486 --> 13:14.890
So, her giving Victoria
the house is her way of saying

13:14.891 --> 13:17.392
that you're a better person?

13:17.393 --> 13:18.760
Hey, I didn't say that.

13:18.761 --> 13:20.928
Mom did.

13:22.097 --> 13:23.330
All right, come on, don't...

13:23.332 --> 13:25.733
All right.

13:32.608 --> 13:34.242
Okay.

13:34.243 --> 13:36.110
I never really
thought I liked karaoke,

13:36.112 --> 13:39.614
but I am really good at it.

13:39.615 --> 13:41.215
Okay, that wasn't karaoke.

13:41.217 --> 13:44.585
That was you, a jukebox,
and a bar full of angry people.

13:45.353 --> 13:46.988
Oh, hello.

13:46.989 --> 13:47.988
Hello.

13:47.990 --> 13:49.424
Good night.

13:49.425 --> 13:50.591
Good night.

13:50.593 --> 13:52.292
Good night.

13:53.128 --> 13:54.562
I just want you to know...

13:54.563 --> 13:56.898
Oh, boy.

13:56.899 --> 13:59.734
...that I'm okay
with Mom's decision.

13:59.735 --> 14:00.902
Well, thank you.

14:00.903 --> 14:02.536
So am I.

14:02.538 --> 14:04.706
Because I get it now,

14:04.707 --> 14:08.408
and it's not your fault
that you're the "screw-up""

14:10.211 --> 14:11.846
Excuse me?

14:11.847 --> 14:12.779
I mean, I was,

14:12.781 --> 14:16.249
I think, a tough act to follow.

14:17.118 --> 14:18.085
You know,

14:18.087 --> 14:19.287
and that couldn't
have been easy,

14:19.288 --> 14:22.622
and... maybe that's
why you're easy.

14:24.826 --> 14:27.695
♪ Easy like Sunday morning. ♪

14:27.696 --> 14:29.664
Okay, okay, okay, all right.

14:29.665 --> 14:31.566
Okay, my little
songbird, let's go.

14:31.567 --> 14:32.600
Up here.

14:32.601 --> 14:34.201
I just wanted to tell her,

14:34.202 --> 14:35.436
I know why Mom did what she did.

14:35.437 --> 14:36.536
Okay.

14:36.538 --> 14:37.771
And why is that?

14:37.773 --> 14:38.973
Don't make me say it.

14:38.974 --> 14:40.107
All right, I'm gonna say it.

14:40.108 --> 14:41.941
Oh, God.

14:41.943 --> 14:44.845
Because I'm the good daughter,

14:44.846 --> 14:47.882
and you're the mess.

14:47.883 --> 14:48.948
Mm.

14:48.950 --> 14:51.285
I see.

14:51.286 --> 14:52.853
So...

14:52.854 --> 14:54.387
I'm the screw-up?

14:54.389 --> 14:57.257
Only in Mom's eyes.

14:57.259 --> 15:00.094
You know, it's just
a little confusing

15:00.095 --> 15:02.796
because I'm not the daughter
who quit her job.

15:02.797 --> 15:05.232
Or has a mountain
of credit card debt

15:05.233 --> 15:08.234
because of a shopping addiction.

15:09.470 --> 15:10.970
Are you listening to this?

15:10.972 --> 15:12.138
I lived it.

15:13.407 --> 15:16.243
And you know what, Mol,
for your information,

15:16.244 --> 15:18.611
all my credit cards
are paid off,

15:18.613 --> 15:20.446
and I have enough money

15:20.448 --> 15:21.415
to put a down payment

15:21.416 --> 15:22.983
on any house in
this neighborhood,

15:22.984 --> 15:25.652
even if I wasn't
already getting one.

15:25.653 --> 15:27.888
And, at the moment,

15:27.889 --> 15:31.658
I am sober and you're the mess.

15:31.659 --> 15:32.893
Hold on.

15:32.894 --> 15:35.628
Hold on a minute.

15:37.798 --> 15:41.100
Are you saying you don't have
any credit card debt, like, any?

15:41.102 --> 15:43.770
Never have, never will.

15:43.771 --> 15:45.739
So, if you'll excuse me,

15:45.740 --> 15:49.642
I'm gonna go upstairs
and see how my stocks did today.

15:54.815 --> 15:56.183
Do we have any stocks?

15:56.184 --> 15:58.984
Aw.

16:05.725 --> 16:08.194
Oh, what are you
doing down here?

16:08.195 --> 16:09.795
I thought you'd
be sleeping it off.

16:09.797 --> 16:11.797
I did.
It's almost noon.

16:11.799 --> 16:14.633
Oh, I guess I was
sleeping it off, too.

16:14.635 --> 16:17.302
Oh, just a heads up,

16:17.304 --> 16:19.973
there's another bin of Polaroids
over there somewhere.

16:19.974 --> 16:22.541
I think it's labeled
"Mom's Box."

16:24.310 --> 16:28.981
Oh, you know what, actually,
I was looking for this.

16:28.983 --> 16:30.416
Oh.

16:30.417 --> 16:32.218
My old Underwood.

16:32.219 --> 16:33.285
Oh, boy,

16:33.287 --> 16:35.255
I hauled this thing
all over the globe

16:35.256 --> 16:37.457
when I was pushing
peanuts for Pan Am.

16:37.458 --> 16:39.826
You know, I saved all those
letters you wrote to us.

16:39.827 --> 16:41.928
Ironically, they're
also in something

16:41.929 --> 16:45.064
labeled "Mom's Box""

16:45.065 --> 16:46.499
I'm gonna let
the grandkids sort that out.

16:47.701 --> 16:51.637
You had a very unique way
of describing the world.

16:51.638 --> 16:53.773
I think those letters
are probably part of the reason

16:53.774 --> 16:55.308
I wanted to become a writer.

16:55.309 --> 16:57.476
You never told me that.

16:57.478 --> 16:59.678
Yeah.

17:00.980 --> 17:03.583
Look, about the house,
I-I get it,

17:03.584 --> 17:05.785
I-I know why you're
not giving it to me.

17:05.786 --> 17:06.786
You do?

17:06.787 --> 17:08.186
Yeah, because I'm the screw-up,

17:08.188 --> 17:10.222
and Victoria's the together one,

17:10.223 --> 17:13.657
and she's gonna take better care
of the house than I would.

17:13.660 --> 17:14.993
No, she's not.

17:14.994 --> 17:17.896
She's gonna sell it
before I'm cold in the ground.

17:17.897 --> 17:19.131
Well, wait a minute,
if you know that,

17:19.132 --> 17:20.633
then why are you
giving it to her?

17:20.634 --> 17:23.334
Is this 'cause she has stocks?

17:23.336 --> 17:25.471
I'm giving it to her,

17:25.472 --> 17:28.973
so you'll have no choice
but to get the hell out.

17:28.975 --> 17:30.809
You want me to leave?

17:30.810 --> 17:32.912
Of course, I do.

17:32.913 --> 17:34.813
I want you to spread your wings,

17:34.814 --> 17:39.218
see the world, live your life...

17:39.219 --> 17:43.022
but not until mine's over.

17:43.023 --> 17:45.790
'Cause I can't imagine
this house without you.

17:47.626 --> 17:50.462
That is the sweetest, and...

17:50.463 --> 17:53.766
and most dysfunctional thing
you've ever said to me.

17:53.767 --> 17:55.266
Thanks.

18:01.508 --> 18:02.608
Boy, I thought Mike and his mom

18:02.609 --> 18:04.843
had a messed up relationship.

18:04.844 --> 18:06.845
Yeah, but they let it all out.

18:06.846 --> 18:08.714
We keep ours hidden,
like civilized people.

18:08.715 --> 18:10.915
Yeah.

18:20.753 --> 18:21.921
Okay, say you lose a limb,

18:21.922 --> 18:24.824
you think it's waiting
for you up in heaven?

18:24.825 --> 18:26.892
Yeah, I'm sure they got
a whole basket of them.

18:26.893 --> 18:29.094
Need a leg, take a leg.

18:30.930 --> 18:34.300
What about this, say I die,
Molly remarries,

18:34.301 --> 18:35.434
now who gets her up there,

18:35.435 --> 18:36.802
me or the squirrely bastard

18:36.803 --> 18:39.004
who moved in
on my grieving widow?

18:39.005 --> 18:41.774
Oh, I never even
thought about that.

18:41.775 --> 18:43.809
My first wife Bunny's
gonna be up there.

18:43.810 --> 18:47.512
Joyce sees her, she'll rip
the halo right off her head.

18:47.514 --> 18:51.717
If she's not already
with Molly's dad.

18:51.718 --> 18:52.851
It's been 30 years.

18:52.852 --> 18:55.320
He's got to have another broad
up there by now.

18:55.321 --> 18:59.323
I mean, he's in heaven,
he's not dead.

19:01.126 --> 19:03.228
I guess we'll just have
to prepare for anything.

19:03.229 --> 19:05.564
Well, if I go first,

19:05.565 --> 19:09.635
I'll try to send you a sign,
give you the lay of the land.

19:09.636 --> 19:12.437
Like haunt me?

19:12.438 --> 19:15.274
No, like a...

19:15.275 --> 19:18.876
a yellow butterfly
landing on your nose.

19:24.016 --> 19:25.751
Wh-what is that gonna tell me?

19:25.752 --> 19:28.085
That I'm still here with you.

19:33.925 --> 19:35.659
Yeah, whatever.

19:39.397 --> 19:40.599
You be a ladybug.

19:40.600 --> 19:42.399
I-I like ladybugs.

19:45.236 --> 19:48.172
I'm not being a ladybug.

19:50.709 --> 19:52.279
It's an eagle or nothing.
