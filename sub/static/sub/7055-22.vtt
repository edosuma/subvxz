00:00.728 --> 00:02.832
The escalator is infested
with nanites,

00:02.834 --> 00:04.627
and the longer they're
in the bloodstream,

00:04.629 --> 00:05.866
the more sensitive
they become.

00:06.138 --> 00:07.672
Causing them
to spontaneously combust.

00:07.740 --> 00:09.179
Previously on <i>Fringe...</i>

00:09.247 --> 00:10.985
Am I gonna die?

00:11.052 --> 00:13.187
Jessica, I just want you
to focus on me, okay?

00:13.255 --> 00:15.322
Okay.

00:17.493 --> 00:19.364
Walter, what just happened
to me?

00:19.432 --> 00:21.802
Cortexiphan has given you
certain kinetic powers.

00:23.104 --> 00:24.175
Jones!

00:29.217 --> 00:31.251
I knew that Jones' plan
was too ingenious,

00:31.319 --> 00:32.319
that it had to have come
from Bell.

00:32.387 --> 00:33.854
He--he's alive, Nina.

00:33.922 --> 00:35.422
I'll prove it to you.

00:35.489 --> 00:36.657
Walter?

00:36.724 --> 00:39.058
What are you folk doing here,
really?

00:39.126 --> 00:41.294
Walter, come on!

00:42.863 --> 00:44.196
Oh, love!

00:44.264 --> 00:46.233
<i>I'm not sure I ever thought</i>

00:46.300 --> 00:47.735
I would see you again.

00:47.803 --> 00:51.308
Hello, old friend.

The Bible tells us
God created his universe

01:03.961 --> 01:05.260
in seven days.

01:05.328 --> 01:09.032
It's taken me
considerably longer.

01:15.606 --> 01:18.341
Beautiful.

01:18.409 --> 01:21.244
Isn't it?

01:27.050 --> 01:31.954
Well, I can't wait
for you to see the real thing.

01:32.022 --> 01:34.426
<i>It's going</i>
<i>to be magnificent.</i>

01:34.493 --> 01:36.629
As soon as I finish
making it.

01:36.697 --> 01:39.265
William, you can't do this.
You can't.

01:39.333 --> 01:40.634
It's done, Walter.

01:40.702 --> 01:43.337
The final piece
has been set into motion.

01:43.405 --> 01:45.139
I couldn't stop it now
if I wanted to.

01:45.207 --> 01:47.610
And I don't.

01:47.678 --> 01:51.014
As scientists,
we're taught that fate

01:51.081 --> 01:52.783
is nothing more
than the convergence

01:52.850 --> 01:54.318
of a set
of probabilities

01:54.386 --> 01:56.320
into one potential outcome,

01:56.388 --> 02:00.125
that there's no such thing
as divine intervention.

02:00.193 --> 02:02.461
And yet I'd be lying
if I said

02:02.529 --> 02:05.065
that the circumstances
that brought you here

02:05.133 --> 02:07.701
to witness this with me,
my trusted colleague,

02:07.769 --> 02:09.303
my dearest friend,

02:09.371 --> 02:12.674
didn't feel
like the hand of God.

02:12.741 --> 02:15.177
There was nothing divine
about it.

02:15.245 --> 02:16.178
I found you.

02:16.246 --> 02:17.179
Yes, you did.

02:17.247 --> 02:19.248
After all these years.

02:19.316 --> 02:20.817
That's what I said.

02:20.885 --> 02:21.885
Providence.

02:26.591 --> 02:29.259
Hey, Walter.

02:32.030 --> 02:34.032
Walter?

02:44.910 --> 02:46.544
<i>You've reached</i>
<i>Astrid Farnsworth.</i>

02:46.612 --> 02:47.913
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

02:47.980 --> 02:49.114
Astrid, it's Olivia.

02:49.182 --> 02:51.583
Can you call me
when you get this?

02:55.655 --> 02:59.726
Whatever Walter was baking,
it didn't turn out too hot.

02:59.794 --> 03:01.227
You think maybe they went out
for breakfast?

03:01.295 --> 03:03.530
I don't know.

03:03.597 --> 03:05.598
Speaking of breakfast,
I put on a pot of coffee.

03:05.666 --> 03:06.666
You want a cup?

03:06.734 --> 03:11.405
Sure.

03:11.473 --> 03:14.775
Here.
Please, let me.

03:14.843 --> 03:17.277
Yes, ma'am.

03:21.149 --> 03:22.416
Do you want
to talk about it?

03:22.484 --> 03:24.885
Talk about what?

03:24.953 --> 03:27.855
The Jedi mind trick you pulled
on me back on the roof.

03:27.923 --> 03:33.596
I can only attribute it
to Cortexiphan.

03:33.663 --> 03:35.731
But, Liv,
suddenly you're able

03:35.799 --> 03:38.033
to do things that you were
never able to do before.

03:38.101 --> 03:40.269
First, you saved Jessica,
and now my shoulder.

03:40.337 --> 03:41.303
Look, I don't know
how I did it.

03:41.371 --> 03:42.972
I just did.

03:43.039 --> 03:44.440
Here you go.

03:44.508 --> 03:49.579
Liv,
when Walter gets back,

03:49.647 --> 03:52.750
I'd like you to let him
run some more tests.

03:52.818 --> 03:54.352
You got it.

04:03.330 --> 04:06.265
Dunham.
<i>Olivia, it's Jessica Holt.</i>

04:06.332 --> 04:07.900
Jessica?

04:07.968 --> 04:09.168
<i>Thank God you picked up.</i>

04:09.236 --> 04:10.736
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

04:10.803 --> 04:12.270
I didn't know
who else to call.

04:12.338 --> 04:13.805
<i>It's okay.</i>

04:13.873 --> 04:16.675
<i>Just calm down.</i>
<i>Tell me what's wrong.</i>

04:16.742 --> 04:18.309
I think someone's
following me.

04:18.377 --> 04:19.810
Following you?

04:19.878 --> 04:20.978
<i>Ever since I left Harvard.</i>

04:21.046 --> 04:23.013
<i>Ever since I met all of you.</i>

04:23.081 --> 04:24.615
Okay, where are you now,
Jessica?

04:24.682 --> 04:27.017
Um, I'm at home.

04:27.085 --> 04:29.019
I sent Sarah
to stay at her dad's flat.

04:29.087 --> 04:30.621
All right,
I want you to do me a favor.

04:30.689 --> 04:32.390
I want you to lock
all the doors and stay inside.

04:32.457 --> 04:33.691
We're gonna be right there.

04:33.759 --> 04:35.193
Okay.

04:35.261 --> 04:37.362
Thank you, Olivia.

Jessica?

Her purse.

Her phone

Come here

06:12.208 --> 06:15.711
She mention anything else

No, just that
since she left us,

06:17.513 --> 06:21.882
she felt
like she'd been followed.

06:23.485 --> 06:25.586
Liv?

06:33.094 --> 06:34.762
Sir?

06:34.829 --> 06:36.597
I need you to meet me
at Boston General.

06:36.665 --> 06:38.766
Agent Farnsworth was just
brought in with a gunshot wound.

06:38.834 --> 06:40.969
Wait, what--when?

06:41.037 --> 06:42.637
<i>The only information I have</i>

06:42.705 --> 06:44.540
<i>is that an anonymous call</i>
<i>was placed to 911.</i>

06:44.607 --> 06:45.541
<i>When the ambulance arrived,</i>
<i>they found Agent Farnsworth.</i>

06:45.608 --> 06:46.842
Well, how is she?

06:46.910 --> 06:47.994
She's out of surgery
and reported

06:48.061 --> 06:49.078
in stable condition.

06:49.902 --> 06:51.486
<i>Okay, and what about Walter?</i>

06:51.571 --> 06:52.738
You should bring him
with you.

06:52.805 --> 06:55.107
We aren't with him.

06:55.158 --> 06:56.975
<i>We thought</i>
<i>that he was with Astrid.</i>

07:00.830 --> 07:02.831
Where is Walter?

07:02.899 --> 07:06.952
Right now,
we don't know.

07:07.019 --> 07:10.789
Do you remember
the last time you saw him?

07:10.857 --> 07:12.841
At the warehouse.

07:12.909 --> 07:14.893
We were looking
for Bell.

07:14.961 --> 07:17.679
<i>Walter thinks</i>
<i>he's still alive.</i>

07:19.999 --> 07:21.016
What warehouse?

07:21.100 --> 07:22.634
By the waterfront.

07:22.702 --> 07:24.302
Where I got shot.

07:24.353 --> 07:26.138
You weren't found
at the waterfront.

07:26.189 --> 07:29.191
Well,
somebody must have moved her.

07:29.275 --> 07:30.859
And called 911.

07:30.943 --> 07:34.863
Which means
they didn't want you dead.

07:34.947 --> 07:37.282
Do you know
who shot you?

07:39.185 --> 07:42.037
There was a crew
of armed men.

07:43.706 --> 07:47.692
And they probably took Walter.

07:51.881 --> 07:53.715
Peter, I tried
to protect him,

07:53.800 --> 07:56.051
but I couldn't get him
out of there.

07:56.135 --> 07:58.637
I know you did.

08:02.541 --> 08:06.261
You said
you were by the waterfront?

08:06.345 --> 08:08.430
<i>The corner of 1st</i>
<i>and Effie.</i>

08:08.514 --> 08:10.065
<i>Right down by the docks.</i>

08:10.149 --> 08:13.185
And there was something
going on there.

08:13.236 --> 08:15.987
We heard strange noises,

08:16.055 --> 08:18.556
animals that I
didn't recognize.

08:20.827 --> 08:22.027
Well, they're probably gone
by now.

08:22.078 --> 08:23.662
I mean,
they must have realized that,

08:23.729 --> 08:24.779
as soon as she regained
consciousness, she'd tell us

08:24.864 --> 08:26.414
where she was.
<i>Still.</i>

08:26.499 --> 08:27.866
Maybe we can find something.

08:27.917 --> 08:29.951
You know, BPD's got

08:30.036 --> 08:31.369
all the information
on Jessica Holt.

08:31.420 --> 08:32.787
I'll let you know
if we find anything.

08:32.871 --> 08:34.172
Okay.

08:34.240 --> 08:36.424
Hey.

08:36.509 --> 08:38.592
Be careful.

08:53.442 --> 08:55.477
But even if Bell
is responsible,

08:55.561 --> 08:57.145
what does infecting people
with nanites

08:57.230 --> 08:59.447
and using the sun's light
to ignite an oil reserve

08:59.532 --> 09:01.149
have to do
with collapsing two universes

09:01.234 --> 09:02.450
to create a new one?

09:02.535 --> 09:05.871
I mean,
how are they connected?

09:05.938 --> 09:08.156
I have absolutely no idea.

09:08.241 --> 09:11.243
Maybe Walter did.

09:19.886 --> 09:23.305
What are you doing here?

09:23.389 --> 09:25.957
I am not here
of my own volition.

09:28.477 --> 09:30.461
<i>Step back from him.</i>

09:33.566 --> 09:35.984
Set down your weapon.
Slowly.

09:37.904 --> 09:38.937
What are you doing?

09:38.988 --> 09:40.488
I'm sure
many things are racing

09:40.573 --> 09:41.489
through your mind right now.

09:41.574 --> 09:43.074
But none of

09:43.142 --> 09:47.245
are as important
as what I'm about to say.

09:47.313 --> 09:49.414
If you ever want
to see Walter again,

09:49.481 --> 09:52.000
put down your gun.

10:02.345 --> 10:04.095
You work for Bell.

10:04.163 --> 10:06.598
You're here because this
is important, right?

10:06.665 --> 10:07.966
So why don't you do something?

10:08.017 --> 10:09.801
<i>He can't.</i>

10:09.852 --> 10:12.637
The stasis runes at his feet
keep him stuck

10:12.705 --> 10:14.372
right where he is.

10:14.440 --> 10:16.024
Unfortunately for you,

10:16.108 --> 10:18.610
this was a future
you didn't foresee.

10:20.863 --> 10:25.033
It seems he's very concerned
about the events in your life.

10:25.117 --> 10:29.070
<i>And Dr. Bell said that,</i>
<i>if we put you in harm's way,</i>

10:29.155 --> 10:30.238
he'd appear.

10:30.323 --> 10:31.489
That day
you were infected,

10:31.540 --> 10:32.874
that was intentional.

10:32.959 --> 10:34.542
You never had a daughter.

10:34.627 --> 10:37.662
I hate kids.

10:37.713 --> 10:39.965
Now let's see

10:40.032 --> 10:43.551
how concerned
you are about him.

10:52.228 --> 10:54.763
<i>They can operate</i>

10:54.847 --> 10:56.481
at hyper-attenuated time.

10:56.548 --> 10:58.767
To us, it almost looks
like magic.

10:58.851 --> 11:01.069
It's not, though.

11:01.153 --> 11:02.354
It's just tech

11:02.405 --> 11:04.322
that essentially lets
them move

11:04.390 --> 11:06.658
very, very fast.

11:08.394 --> 11:09.611
Now this gun

11:09.695 --> 11:11.413
<i>is an invention</i>
<i>of Dr. Bell's.</i>

11:11.497 --> 11:13.531
Shoots faster.

11:27.179 --> 11:28.763
<i>Okay, what are you doing?</i>

11:28.848 --> 11:30.715
I mean,
what do you want?

11:30.766 --> 11:32.600
Please, could you just put
the gun down

11:32.685 --> 11:34.102
and talk to me?

11:34.186 --> 11:35.603
He feels no emotion.

11:35.688 --> 11:37.605
Perhaps no pain.

11:37.690 --> 11:40.558
This won't upset him.

11:40.609 --> 11:43.478
But it appears
to upset you.

11:43.562 --> 11:44.863
Damn it, stop.
Just--

11:44.930 --> 11:47.699
just tell me what it is
that you want.

12:18.392 --> 12:20.808
Here, can I stop the bleeding?
Can you sit down?

12:20.810 --> 12:21.726
I cannot.

12:21.811 --> 12:22.811
Huh?

12:22.878 --> 12:24.229
<i>It is impossible</i>

12:24.313 --> 12:26.314
right now.

12:26.382 --> 12:27.816
We're in the warehouse.
Hurry.

12:27.883 --> 12:31.686
EMTs are on the way.
September, what is this thing?

12:31.737 --> 12:37.025
I am surprised they knew
of this methodology.

12:37.076 --> 12:39.077
It is beyond them.

12:50.673 --> 12:52.257
Oh.

12:52.341 --> 12:54.342
- Will you let me check the wound?
- Walter--

12:54.409 --> 12:58.546
Dr. Bishop,
do you know where he is?

12:58.597 --> 13:01.549
No.
I do not.

13:01.600 --> 13:06.354
At least now we know
how you got shot.

13:06.421 --> 13:07.522
I've seen you

13:07.589 --> 13:09.891
shot before
just like this.

13:12.094 --> 13:14.028
You came to me
at the opera house.

13:14.096 --> 13:18.233
You said, in every version
of the future,

13:18.284 --> 13:20.618
I would have to die.

13:22.938 --> 13:26.491
I did not.

13:26.575 --> 13:29.394
<i>Or I have not yet.</i>

13:29.462 --> 13:34.666
I suspect
I understand now.

13:34.750 --> 13:37.685
The conversation
you are referring to

13:37.753 --> 13:41.840
has not yet happened
for me.

13:41.924 --> 13:44.976
I must investigate
the future

13:45.060 --> 13:47.479
and find out
what I meant.

13:50.900 --> 13:56.771
I hope...

13:56.822 --> 13:58.940
I get back to you
in time.

14:08.417 --> 14:10.502
Well, what are we gonna do
about finding Walter?

14:10.586 --> 14:12.620
Our only lead is dead.

14:12.671 --> 14:15.089
That doesn't mean
we can't still question her.

14:27.019 --> 14:29.020
<i>No, no, no. Not there.</i>

14:29.104 --> 14:31.356
Right here.
Right in her thinker.

14:51.377 --> 14:53.161
That wasn't so bad,
was it?

14:55.965 --> 14:58.583
How long has she been dead?

14:58.667 --> 15:00.335
About 25 minutes.

15:00.386 --> 15:01.702
Quickly.

15:08.394 --> 15:10.511
Use the negative prongs first
or she'll short out.

15:11.880 --> 15:13.431
Start with a trickle of DC

15:13.515 --> 15:15.149
<i>and let it calibrate.</i>
<i>No more.</i>

15:18.387 --> 15:21.573
Pretty.

15:26.228 --> 15:29.030
There'll come a time
when I'll ask you

15:29.081 --> 15:31.065
how you knew
about this technology.

15:34.920 --> 15:38.172
Maintain her body temperature
at roughly 85 degrees.

15:38.240 --> 15:39.757
I'll get the ice packs.

15:49.602 --> 15:52.770
If she knows anything
about what happened to Walter,

15:52.855 --> 15:55.006
I assure you
we will too.

15:55.074 --> 15:57.692
Well, she took a chance
on dying at that office building

15:57.759 --> 16:00.695
for whatever her mission is.

16:00.762 --> 16:02.947
She was counting on me
to save her.

16:03.032 --> 16:05.867
They used Jessica
to play on my sympathies,

16:05.934 --> 16:08.286
and then they used
my feelings for Peter,

16:08.370 --> 16:10.488
my fear
that Jones would kill him.

16:10.572 --> 16:12.874
William always talked a lot
about the powers

16:12.941 --> 16:14.792
Cortexiphan children
might have.

16:14.877 --> 16:17.078
But why is he
activating me now?

16:17.129 --> 16:18.997
Why is he doing this?

16:19.064 --> 16:20.999
My dear...

16:21.083 --> 16:23.384
you may have a different set
of memories now,

16:23.452 --> 16:24.886
but, at heart,

16:24.953 --> 16:28.006
you're still the same girl
I knew.

16:28.090 --> 16:31.709
You've always had
incredible compassion.

16:31.777 --> 16:35.063
It was your capacity for feeling
that made William and Walter

16:35.130 --> 16:37.015
so sure that you were
the perfect candidate

16:37.099 --> 16:38.900
for the trials.

16:38.967 --> 16:43.104
And I don't know what it is,
but William must want--

16:43.155 --> 16:46.591
no, he needs
something from you.

16:46.659 --> 16:50.845
Something
only you can provide.

16:53.749 --> 16:55.833
Why, William?

16:55.918 --> 16:57.535
Why would you do this?

16:57.619 --> 16:59.837
What could you possibly hope
to gain

16:59.922 --> 17:02.090
by destroying
both universes?

17:02.157 --> 17:06.594
Walter,
this was all your idea.

17:06.661 --> 17:08.930
Peter died twice.

17:08.997 --> 17:11.382
You hated God.

17:11.467 --> 17:14.018
"What kind of God would cause
so much suffering?"

17:14.103 --> 17:15.353
That's what you said.

17:15.436 --> 17:17.972
So much pain.

17:18.022 --> 17:20.058
You decided
to create a universe

17:20.142 --> 17:23.277
that would operate
by your rules.

17:23.345 --> 17:26.481
And then, when you realized
that you were smart enough

17:26.531 --> 17:28.366
to do it,
you got scared.

17:28.434 --> 17:31.619
You asked me to cut out
a portion of your brain.

17:31.686 --> 17:33.871
- No.
- Yes, Walter.

17:33.956 --> 17:37.158
We cut those ideas
out of your head

17:37.209 --> 17:41.913
to literally put the genie
back into the bottle.

17:41.997 --> 17:44.966
<i>Then I grew older.</i>

17:45.033 --> 17:49.003
I grew cynical.

17:49.054 --> 17:50.555
I grew cancer.

17:50.639 --> 17:53.224
<i>I realized</i>

17:53.308 --> 17:55.176
that dosing myself
with Cortexiphan

17:55.227 --> 17:56.594
would slow it down.

17:56.678 --> 17:59.147
But slowing is not stopping.

17:59.214 --> 18:00.648
For me,
it's just a matter of time.

18:00.715 --> 18:02.350
The clock is ticking.
Tick, tick, tick,

18:02.401 --> 18:03.818
<i>tick, tick.</i>

18:03.885 --> 18:06.187
<i>And that's when it occurred</i>
<i>to me.</i>

18:06.238 --> 18:08.239
You were right, Walter.

18:08.323 --> 18:10.441
Walter,
you were right, right, right.

18:10.526 --> 18:13.127
<i>Every rant you ever went on</i>
<i>made perfect sense.</i>

18:13.195 --> 18:15.780
<i>Suddenly, I understood</i>
<i>not just you,</i>

18:15.864 --> 18:20.535
but everything.

18:20.602 --> 18:23.204
God made us
in his image.

18:23.255 --> 18:25.456
<i>If that is so,</i>

18:25.541 --> 18:28.509
<i>if we are capable</i>
<i>of being Gods,</i>

18:28.577 --> 18:31.045
then it is our destiny
to do so.

18:31.096 --> 18:33.214
No. No.

18:33.265 --> 18:34.549
No, William.

18:34.600 --> 18:37.969
My dear friend,

18:38.053 --> 18:39.887
even if you deny it now,

18:39.938 --> 18:44.058
you have always
been playing God.

18:44.109 --> 18:46.110
I am.

18:55.600 --> 18:56.933
Guys, we're ready.

19:08.646 --> 19:09.980
Jessica, can you hear
my voice?

19:13.568 --> 19:15.986
I can't--
I can't feel my arms.

19:16.070 --> 19:18.938
<i>I can't feel my legs.</i>
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

19:18.990 --> 19:20.273
Why can't I feel anything?

19:20.324 --> 19:21.942
Where is Walter?

19:22.009 --> 19:26.946
What did you do to me?

19:26.998 --> 19:29.216
What just happened there?
Did she faint?

19:29.283 --> 19:30.500
No, no,
that's not possible.

19:30.585 --> 19:33.453
She's not alive.
She can't faint.

19:39.093 --> 19:41.511
Mum?

19:41.596 --> 19:43.296
<i>Mummy?</i>
<i>Mummy, where are you, mummy?</i>

19:43.347 --> 19:46.133
Mummy,
where are you?

19:46.200 --> 19:47.901
<i>Jessica,</i>
<i>we need you to tell us</i>

19:47.968 --> 19:50.020
<i>where William Bell is.</i>

19:55.476 --> 19:59.246
Ding, ding, ding.

19:59.313 --> 20:00.980
My bicycle.

20:01.032 --> 20:03.817
My bicycle is blue

20:03.885 --> 20:05.585
and has a little chimey bell
on it.

20:05.653 --> 20:06.703
Ding, ding, ding.

20:06.771 --> 20:08.371
<i>My bicycle is blue</i>

20:08.456 --> 20:10.207
<i>and has a little chimey bell.</i>

20:10.291 --> 20:12.259
I left it in the rain,
and it rusted.

20:12.326 --> 20:14.544
Jessica.
Jessica, look at me.

20:14.629 --> 20:17.664
<i>William Bell,</i>

20:17.732 --> 20:19.499
where is he?

20:19.550 --> 20:21.218
Mm-hmm.

20:21.285 --> 20:24.604
He's all wet I expect.

20:24.672 --> 20:25.972
And a bore.

20:26.040 --> 20:29.609
<i>A man must be blind</i>

20:29.677 --> 20:31.344
or be out of his mind

20:31.412 --> 20:34.447
to go out to sea
once more.

20:34.515 --> 20:36.733
He's on a boat.

20:36.817 --> 20:38.851
It's probably close
to where he shot Astrid.

20:38.903 --> 20:40.070
This is taking too long.

20:40.154 --> 20:41.238
Jessica!

20:41.322 --> 20:43.156
Is William Bell
on a boat?

20:43.224 --> 20:46.860
William Bell
is a great man.

20:46.928 --> 20:49.012
A brilliant man.

20:49.080 --> 20:50.497
But not just a man.

20:50.548 --> 20:53.466
Birth to a new world

20:53.534 --> 20:54.918
born of the collapse.

20:55.002 --> 20:56.253
Jessica, how is he going
to give birth

20:56.337 --> 20:58.154
<i>to a new world</i>
<i>if we closed</i>

20:58.222 --> 21:00.006
<i>the bridge</i>
<i>between the two universes?</i>

21:00.057 --> 21:01.808
I'm afraid
we don't have much longer.

21:01.875 --> 21:04.177
How is he going to collapse
the two universes?

21:09.383 --> 21:10.817
He needed an energy source.

21:10.884 --> 21:12.385
<i>What energy source?</i>

21:12.436 --> 21:14.604
We're all expendable

21:14.689 --> 21:15.822
in the wake
of creation.

21:15.890 --> 21:17.824
Jessica, how is he going
too it?

21:17.891 --> 21:20.660
Noah was a righteous man,
and he brought

21:20.728 --> 21:23.330
onto the Ark every creature
to populate the new world,

21:23.397 --> 21:24.731
two by two.

21:24.782 --> 21:27.284
Damn it, Jessica,
what energy source?

21:37.094 --> 21:38.845
What...

21:38.912 --> 21:41.914
<i>What just happened?</i>
<i>Did I just do that?</i>

21:41.966 --> 21:43.133
Does Walter have
a gauss meter?

21:43.217 --> 21:44.718
Yeah.

21:44.769 --> 21:46.136
I think I know
what's happening here.

21:46.220 --> 21:49.589
The new energy source,
it's me.

21:53.894 --> 21:57.230
Bell's going to try and use me
to collapse the two universes.

21:57.281 --> 22:00.400
That's why
he's been activating me.

22:05.623 --> 22:06.990
The electromagnetic energy

22:07.074 --> 22:08.625
you're giving off
is extraordinary.

22:11.078 --> 22:14.664
But if William is using
the energy you're generating,

22:14.749 --> 22:17.267
I believe I may know
how to find him.

22:28.796 --> 22:30.814
A general cargo freighter
left Boston Harbor

22:30.898 --> 22:32.766
at 10:22 this morning,
the <i>Talos.</i>

22:32.817 --> 22:34.801
It fell off radar
15 minutes later.

22:34.852 --> 22:36.302
That's six hours ago.

22:36.354 --> 22:39.773
It could be 200 miles
off the coast by now.

22:39.824 --> 22:42.242
Talk to me.
It's not good.

22:42.309 --> 22:44.277
Olivia is giving off
an exceedingly strong

22:44.328 --> 22:46.079
and specific
electromagnetic field.

22:46.146 --> 22:47.864
<i>Now I know</i>
<i>how it sounds,</i>

22:47.948 --> 22:49.482
but I believe
she was activated

22:49.533 --> 22:51.201
to power
the universe collapse.

22:51.285 --> 22:53.953
Lucky me.

22:54.005 --> 22:58.258
And I assume
you can't turn her off.

22:58.325 --> 22:59.659
No.

22:59.710 --> 23:01.428
But we can use her

23:01.495 --> 23:04.297
<i>to find Walter</i>
<i>and William Bell.</i>

23:04.348 --> 23:05.965
<i>The frequency</i>
<i>at which Olivia is resonating</i>

23:06.000 --> 23:07.834
<i>will also be the frequency</i>
<i>at the epicenter</i>

23:07.885 --> 23:09.636
<i>of the dimensional</i>
<i>intersection,</i>

23:09.687 --> 23:11.221
meaning we should be able
to identify

23:11.305 --> 23:13.223
the exact location

23:13.307 --> 23:14.941
where the two universes
are overlapping.

23:15.008 --> 23:17.894
Now, assuming Bell
wants to survive the collapse,

23:17.978 --> 23:19.396
that's where he'll be.

23:19.480 --> 23:21.648
The calm at the center
of the storm as it were.

23:21.699 --> 23:23.149
And how long will it take?

23:23.200 --> 23:26.069
The satellites
are almost online.

23:28.656 --> 23:30.824
We'll find Bell.

23:30.875 --> 23:32.826
<i>We've got NAVSTAR.</i>

23:32.877 --> 23:35.161
<i>Task the satellites</i>
<i>at 392.6 hertz.</i>

23:35.229 --> 23:37.247
<i>National Weather Service</i>
<i>is reporting a squall</i>

23:37.331 --> 23:40.032
approximately 80 miles
off shore due east of Boston.

23:40.084 --> 23:43.753
Three microquakes--Albany,
New York, Waterville, Vermont,

23:43.838 --> 23:45.004
<i>and Worcester, Massachusetts,</i>

23:45.056 --> 23:46.256
<i>all within seconds</i>
<i>of each other.</i>

23:46.340 --> 23:47.257
It's started.

23:47.341 --> 23:49.259
The universes are colliding.

23:49.343 --> 23:51.878
Narrow your search
to the area of the storm.

24:06.177 --> 24:09.061
- Did you find Bell?
- Not yet.

24:09.113 --> 24:13.199
Wonder what he has in store
for me now.

24:27.247 --> 24:28.965
It's gonna be okay.

24:29.049 --> 24:34.387
You know, for the first time,
I don't think that it is.

24:34.438 --> 24:36.422
I remember being in that lab
in Jacksonville

24:36.474 --> 24:38.858
when Walter and William
were doing

24:38.926 --> 24:40.810
the Cortexiphan trials.

24:40.895 --> 24:43.897
I remember
how it smelled,

24:43.948 --> 24:45.315
how I felt,

24:45.399 --> 24:46.566
how scared I was,

24:46.617 --> 24:48.034
how all alone I was.

24:48.102 --> 24:51.821
And now, you know,
years later,

24:51.906 --> 24:54.106
nothing's changed.

24:54.158 --> 24:55.909
I'm still that little girl,

24:55.960 --> 24:58.878
and William Bell is still doing
experiments on me.

24:58.946 --> 25:01.915
I'm just still being used.

25:04.585 --> 25:09.088
No.
Something has changed.

25:09.156 --> 25:13.960
This time,
you're not alone.

25:39.486 --> 25:41.921
<i>You have to see this.</i>

25:41.989 --> 25:45.208
Oh, don't look like that.

25:45.292 --> 25:47.594
If nothing else,
for pure scientific curiosity.

25:47.661 --> 25:48.828
Trust me.

25:48.879 --> 25:50.129
You've never seen anything
like this.

25:50.181 --> 25:54.551
It's marvelous.

26:05.312 --> 26:06.980
How?

26:07.031 --> 26:09.015
Olivia.

26:09.066 --> 26:10.817
You were right,
Walter.

26:10.868 --> 26:13.536
She truly is
a remarkable girl.

26:39.125 --> 26:40.292
Got it.

26:40.343 --> 26:42.160
84 miles due east
of Nantucket.

26:42.211 --> 26:43.378
<i>Call upstairs.</i>

26:43.463 --> 26:45.630
Tell them we need choppers.

26:45.681 --> 26:48.850
Get suited up.

26:57.860 --> 27:00.612
William, William...

27:00.679 --> 27:02.481
Please.

27:02.532 --> 27:03.732
Don't do this.

27:03.816 --> 27:05.734
You may be sad now,
Walter,

27:05.818 --> 27:07.519
you may be frightened,
but you'll see.

27:07.570 --> 27:09.704
We deserve this.

27:12.074 --> 27:13.825
No.

27:19.582 --> 27:20.665
These are the coordinates,
ma'am,

27:20.716 --> 27:22.167
but I've got no visual.

27:22.218 --> 27:24.002
<i>Okay, well, it's not here.</i>

27:24.053 --> 27:25.253
Can you check the uplink?

27:25.338 --> 27:26.704
Maybe they're jamming us.

27:26.756 --> 27:29.257
Are you kidding me?
It's right there.

27:35.348 --> 27:37.549
<i>I don't see anything.</i>
Nina.

27:37.617 --> 27:39.150
No, nothing.

27:39.218 --> 27:40.936
Am I losing
my mind here?

27:41.020 --> 27:43.154
Still no visual contact,
sir.

27:43.222 --> 27:45.557
No, I think I know
what's happening.

27:45.608 --> 27:48.109
<i>If William is trying</i>
<i>to collapse the universes,</i>

27:48.194 --> 27:49.611
it stands to reason
that the fabric

27:49.695 --> 27:51.530
between the universes
is growing thin

27:51.581 --> 27:53.198
here where his ship is.

27:53.249 --> 27:54.499
But there's nothing here.

27:54.567 --> 27:56.501
<i>No, not in this here.</i>

27:56.569 --> 27:58.736
The ship has already phased
entirely out of sync

27:58.788 --> 27:59.737
with our universe.

27:59.789 --> 28:01.373
<i>No one here can see it,</i>

28:01.424 --> 28:02.791
<i>but Peter--</i>
<i>I'm from the other side,</i>

28:02.875 --> 28:04.793
so I resonate
at a different frequency.

28:04.877 --> 28:06.127
<i>Yes, from the other side,</i>
<i>the ship is visible.</i>

28:06.212 --> 28:08.129
For how much longer,

28:08.214 --> 28:09.514
we can't be sure.

28:09.582 --> 28:10.882
But if it's already
crossed over

28:10.933 --> 28:12.133
into the other universe,
there's no way

28:12.218 --> 28:13.852
for us to get to it.

28:13.919 --> 28:15.587
<i>Even if we had the time,</i>
<i>the bridge is closed.</i>

28:15.638 --> 28:17.172
<i>There is a way.</i>

28:17.240 --> 28:19.975
Me.

28:20.059 --> 28:24.696
Yes, Olivia now has as much
activated Cortexiphan

28:24.763 --> 28:28.099
in her system as the Olivia
from the original timeline.

28:28.150 --> 28:30.485
<i>Now, if what you both</i>
<i>have told me is accurate,</i>

28:30.570 --> 28:32.537
Olivia can jump
between worlds.

28:32.605 --> 28:34.105
You, Peter,
you can see it.

28:34.156 --> 28:35.707
<i>Olivia, you can reach it.</i>

28:35.774 --> 28:38.109
<i>But it will have</i>
<i>to be done together.</i>

28:38.160 --> 28:40.328
What if I can't do it?

28:40.396 --> 28:42.280
You have
the most extraordinary gifts,

28:42.331 --> 28:44.883
but the only one you were denied
was knowing it.

28:44.950 --> 28:47.919
You've had the power
all along.

28:54.510 --> 28:57.429
Are you ready?

29:22.204 --> 29:24.489
All right.

29:24.540 --> 29:26.041
If you've lost your mind,

29:26.125 --> 29:31.162
now would be the time
to tell me.

29:31.213 --> 29:33.381
Take it to port
about three yards.

29:38.854 --> 29:40.805
Now!

29:56.372 --> 29:59.157
- It worked.
- Yeah, are you surprised?

29:59.208 --> 30:01.359
Yeah.

30:01.410 --> 30:03.828
It was the pilot's.

30:03.879 --> 30:05.080
You can't be the only one

30:05.164 --> 30:07.415
who always gets
to carry a gun.

30:18.894 --> 30:21.846
What is this place?

30:21.897 --> 30:23.765
I think this is his Ark.

30:29.121 --> 30:30.655
"I will arise

30:30.723 --> 30:32.607
"and go, now,

30:32.692 --> 30:34.526
"and go to Innisfree,

30:34.577 --> 30:38.496
<i>"and a small cabin build there,</i>

30:38.564 --> 30:40.815
<i>"of clay and wattles made.</i>

30:40.883 --> 30:42.867
"Nine bean-rows

30:42.918 --> 30:44.119
"will I have there,

30:44.203 --> 30:46.838
"a hive for the honeybee,

30:46.905 --> 30:52.410
and live alone
in the bee loud glade."

30:54.930 --> 30:58.383
Do you know it,
Walter?

30:58.434 --> 31:00.935
Yeats.

31:02.722 --> 31:05.807
Walter,
are you all right?

31:05.891 --> 31:08.810
<i>Well, this is unexpected.</i>

31:08.894 --> 31:12.030
You know I was not planning
on having any humans.

31:12.097 --> 31:14.766
What a troublesome species
we can be after all.

31:14.817 --> 31:18.486
I had assumed
that Walter and I would die off

31:18.571 --> 31:21.439
and my new universe
would thrive

31:21.490 --> 31:24.542
unencumbered by the savage whims
of mankind.

31:24.610 --> 31:29.113
But I see I was wrong.

31:29.165 --> 31:30.899
Look at the two of you.

31:30.966 --> 31:33.951
Humans abide.
They persevere.

31:34.003 --> 31:35.920
They survive.

31:35.971 --> 31:38.122
You have earned your right
in the new order,

31:38.174 --> 31:39.758
a final breeding pair.

31:39.809 --> 31:41.726
<i>Amongst all others,</i>

31:41.794 --> 31:44.295
you will be
the new Adam and Eve.

31:44.346 --> 31:45.463
Stop this.

31:45.514 --> 31:46.731
Turn it off now.

31:46.799 --> 31:48.466
Shoot me if you like,
young Peter.

31:48.517 --> 31:49.901
I cannot turn it off.

31:49.968 --> 31:51.519
There's no escaping
the inevitable.

31:51.604 --> 31:54.239
The chain reaction
has begun.

31:54.306 --> 31:58.026
Olivia is
a living uncertainty engine.

31:58.110 --> 31:59.210
Every breath she takes

31:59.278 --> 32:01.446
brings us closer
to Nirvana.

32:01.497 --> 32:03.198
<i>Every beat of her heart</i>

32:03.282 --> 32:04.616
<i>tears the world</i>
<i>from its hinges.</i>

32:04.667 --> 32:05.917
She is the redeemer.

32:05.984 --> 32:07.786
Go ahead.

32:07.837 --> 32:12.156
I will not be the first God
to be martyred for creation.

32:12.208 --> 32:15.710
<i>Forgive me.</i>

32:20.850 --> 32:24.385
No!

32:27.389 --> 32:30.391
No!
No.

32:30.476 --> 32:32.343
No.

32:32.394 --> 32:35.113
You killed her.

32:35.180 --> 32:37.515
Yes, indeed,
he did.

32:37.566 --> 32:41.519
Very clever,
old friend.

32:45.541 --> 32:46.991
<i>If that's what you consider</i>

32:47.042 --> 32:48.827
<i>learning a lesson</i>
<i>from the past...</i>

32:50.880 --> 32:54.048
You paid a steep price.

32:56.902 --> 33:01.723
We could have all been
so happy together.

33:10.716 --> 33:14.719
You killed her.

33:21.898 --> 33:23.199
Don't touch her.

33:23.266 --> 33:24.233
Peter, this is no time
for emotions.

33:24.284 --> 33:25.818
Time is of the essence.

33:25.902 --> 33:27.036
We have to move rapidly
if we're going to save her.

33:27.103 --> 33:28.704
Save her?
She's dead.

33:28.771 --> 33:29.938
You know very well
that hasn't always stopped me.

33:29.990 --> 33:31.940
Peter!
Listen to me!

33:31.992 --> 33:33.993
Now, go over there
to the table,

33:34.077 --> 33:36.045
get the letter opener,
and clear

33:36.112 --> 33:38.581
everything else off the desk.
Do it now, Peter.

33:49.593 --> 33:52.094
Her brain is currently saturated
with Cortexiphan.

33:52.145 --> 33:54.013
<i>The brain tissue</i>
<i>is regenerative,</i>

33:54.097 --> 33:55.898
so, if I can get
the bullet out

33:55.965 --> 33:58.434
before the Cortexiphan
wears off

33:58.485 --> 34:00.135
and the non-regenerative tissue
calcifies,

34:00.186 --> 34:01.937
I'll be able to save her.

34:01.988 --> 34:03.489
It's like my lemon cake.

34:05.475 --> 34:07.109
Whoa.
Whoa.

34:07.160 --> 34:08.110
Stop.
What are you doing?

34:08.161 --> 34:09.527
I need
an exit wound.

34:09.612 --> 34:11.496
There isn't one.

34:47.850 --> 34:49.685
How much time
do we have, Walter?

34:51.353 --> 34:54.790
Not long.

34:54.857 --> 34:56.492
Any damage I do

34:56.543 --> 34:59.628
should repair itself...

34:59.696 --> 35:02.548
If I can get
the bullet out.

35:15.178 --> 35:19.381
I'm so sorry, Olive.

35:51.080 --> 35:54.466
Walter.

36:10.600 --> 36:13.485
It worked.

36:34.957 --> 36:37.092
Despite full
international cooperation,

36:37.143 --> 36:38.844
there remains no sign
of William Bell.

36:38.928 --> 36:42.431
The biological materials
from Dr. Bell's Ark

36:42.482 --> 36:45.434
have been cryogenically
quarantined for future study.

36:45.485 --> 36:47.686
Your team will of course
have full access

36:47.771 --> 36:48.970
if you so desire.

36:49.022 --> 36:50.138
Thank you.

36:50.190 --> 36:51.774
The committee would like

36:51.825 --> 36:53.859
to acknowledge the work
you and your team have done

36:53.943 --> 36:56.645
<i>in protecting the welfare</i>
<i>of the people of this nation</i>

36:56.696 --> 36:58.080
and the world.

36:58.147 --> 37:00.749
As such, we would like
to grant your request

37:00.817 --> 37:02.284
for significant funding

37:02.352 --> 37:05.621
to upgrade your operational
and scientific divisions.

37:05.672 --> 37:07.940
And thank you,
Phillip,

37:08.007 --> 37:10.459
for keeping us all safe
at night.

37:10.510 --> 37:13.295
You're welcome, sir.

37:13.363 --> 37:16.215
Well, that will be all,

37:16.299 --> 37:17.800
General Broyles.

37:17.851 --> 37:19.268
It's Colonel, sir.

37:19.335 --> 37:20.769
Not anymore.

37:20.837 --> 37:22.971
Congratulations,
General.

37:23.022 --> 37:26.809
You've earned it.

37:26.860 --> 37:28.944
How'd it go?

37:29.011 --> 37:30.279
Better than expected.

37:30.346 --> 37:32.281
Fringe Division
now finds itself

37:32.348 --> 37:33.732
with a fully-funded
science division

37:33.817 --> 37:36.452
and no one to run it.

37:36.519 --> 37:38.320
Well...

37:38.371 --> 37:41.290
Nina...

37:41.357 --> 37:45.327
You want a job?

38:02.061 --> 38:04.980
You know, Peter,
I've been thinking.

38:05.047 --> 38:09.268
Due to the intense
energy utilization,

38:09.352 --> 38:13.272
Cortexiphan levels in the body
should be almost negligible.

38:13.356 --> 38:15.774
Meaning what, Walter?

38:15.859 --> 38:17.225
Well, meaning
that she won't be able

38:17.277 --> 38:19.394
to run around
setting things on fire

38:19.445 --> 38:21.062
or doing superhuman things.

38:21.114 --> 38:22.281
Excuse me, miss.

38:22.365 --> 38:23.615
Is that lemon Jell-O?

38:23.700 --> 38:25.400
These are
urine samples.

38:25.451 --> 38:28.670
Oh, well, in that case,
no, thank you.

38:28.738 --> 38:32.791
I'm more peckish
than thirsty.

38:32.876 --> 38:36.545
So you're saying
Olivia's normal now?

38:36.596 --> 38:39.798
Well, the treatments did leave
a biological signature,

38:39.883 --> 38:41.416
<i>so I suppose</i>
<i>some abilities</i>

I just figured, after everything

of days--

39:52.372 --> 39:57.376
well, hell,
