<i>Dan: Ernie Els, who missed
eight fairways on the back 9,</i>

43:51.696 --> 43:53.926

the day one under par</i>

43:53.999 --> 43:56.730
to stay within three strokes
of the leader, Tiger Woods,

43:56.801 --> 43:58.929
who some of you
may have heard of.

43:59.004 --> 44:00.130
That's all for us.

44:00.205 --> 44:02.037
Don't forget tomorrow's
a big day

44:02.107 --> 44:04.405
<i>as "March Madness" heads
into the ronde de seize.</i>

44:04.476 --> 44:06.706
You can join us
starting at 3:00 tomorrow

44:06.778 --> 44:08.678
when Dan and I will begin
our continuing coverage

44:08.747 --> 44:09.737
of the Sweet 16.

44:09.814 --> 44:11.543
We'll be joined by analysts
in the field

44:11.616 --> 44:12.708
and our own Bobbi Bernstein

44:12.784 --> 44:14.752
-- right here in the studio.
-- [ Chokes]

44:14.819 --> 44:16.480
The fun starts tomorrow
afternoon at 3:00,

44:16.554 --> 44:18.955
and we'll be with you right
through till 11:00 P.M.

44:19.024 --> 44:21.425
You've been watching
"Sports Night" on CSC.

44:21.493 --> 44:23.257
-- Have a good night.
-- Good night.

44:23.328 --> 44:24.318
<i>Dave: Music.
Will: Go.</i>

44:24.396 --> 44:25.386
-- <i>Animation.
Chris: Go.</i>

44:25.463 --> 44:26.897
<i>We're out.</i>

44:26.965 --> 44:28.091
-- Whoa!
-- Take it easy.

44:28.166 --> 44:28.860
-- Whoa!
-- Dan.

44:28.933 --> 44:30.128
When did this happen?

44:30.201 --> 44:31.760
You're talking
about Bobbi Bernstein?

44:31.836 --> 44:34.100
Yes, I am -- yes, I am talking
about Bobbi Bernstein.

44:34.172 --> 44:35.833
I guess Dana forgot
to tell you.

44:35.907 --> 44:38.274
Yes, I guess she did, Casey.
I guess she forgot to tell me.

44:38.343 --> 44:39.504
Oh, hey, you know what, Dan?

44:39.577 --> 44:41.443
I forgot to tell you
about Bobbi Bernstein.

44:41.513 --> 44:43.811
-- Yes, you did. -- B0bbi's
sitting in for Jack.

44:45.884 --> 44:47.045
What's wrong with Jack?

44:47.118 --> 44:48.449
-- He's sick.
-- How sick?

44:48.520 --> 44:49.749
He's got flu-like symptoms.

44:49.821 --> 44:51.812
Oh, honestly, who doesn't?
[Laughs]

44:51.890 --> 44:53.984
What's the problem
with Bobbi Bernstein?

44:54.059 --> 44:55.049
There's no problem.

44:55.126 --> 44:56.685
-- She's good.
-- She's <i>very</i> good.

44:56.761 --> 44:58.195
She knows college basketball.

44:58.263 --> 44:59.924
She's very good.

44:59.998 --> 45:03.263
Listen, Isaac's gonna want to show
us pictures from his vacation.

45:03.334 --> 45:04.529
So I'm gonna get
a "Welcome Back" cake,

45:04.602 --> 45:06.195
and we'll have a little party
in his office tomorrow.

45:06.271 --> 45:07.295
What kind of cake?

45:07.372 --> 45:08.703
-- What kind of cake?
-- Yes.

45:08.773 --> 45:10.639
I don't know, Casey.
Why do you ask?

45:10.708 --> 45:11.800
I'm particular about cake,

45:11.876 --> 45:15.278
and I have to say it's been my experience
that men buy better cake than women.

45:15.346 --> 45:18.407
I've found that women tend to get
these yogurt-frosted, low-cal things

45:18.483 --> 45:19.973
laced with a rum-and-fruit
concoction

45:20.051 --> 45:22.213
that make eating cake into
something you do to be polite.

45:22.287 --> 45:24.016
So that's why I was asking
what kind of cake

45:24.089 --> 45:26.888
you were planning on getting to
celebrate Isaac's return from vacation.

45:26.958 --> 45:29.757
Wow. I didn't know you felt
so strongly about it.

45:29.828 --> 45:33.787
But now that I do, I guess the answer is...
whatever cake I damn please.

45:33.865 --> 45:35.299
Excellent.

45:35.366 --> 45:36.925
Bobbi's coming in
from St. Louis.

45:37.001 --> 45:38.696
She'll be here
a little before 3:00.

45:38.770 --> 45:40.499
-- Good. -- There's no
problem with Bobbi?

45:40.572 --> 45:42.506
-- No, ma'am.
-- Good.

45:42.574 --> 45:46.909
[indistinct voices]

45:46.978 --> 45:48.036
I'd go for it.

45:50.949 --> 45:52.678
<i>Dan." Dana.</i>

45:52.750 --> 45:55.845
-- Can you believe I get a whole little
cake speech from that guy? -- Yeah.

45:55.920 --> 45:58.412
I mean, is there anything
he won't make a speech about?

45:58.490 --> 46:00.754
Is there anything
he won't sit in judgment on?

46:00.825 --> 46:04.591
I mean, I am sorry to end two sentences
in a row with a preposition like that,

46:04.662 --> 46:06.096
-- but no kidding, Danny --
-- Dana.

46:06.164 --> 46:07.563
-- Yeah?
-- Hi.

46:07.632 --> 46:08.997
Hi. [Chuckles]

46:09.067 --> 46:10.364
Here's the thing --

46:10.435 --> 46:13.097
Bobbi and I have
a very peculiar relationship.

46:13.171 --> 46:15.640
-- I didn't know you had a relationship.
-- We don't.

46:15.707 --> 46:17.505
-- I'm confused.
-- You and me both.

46:17.575 --> 46:18.599
Dan...

46:18.676 --> 46:20.542
When I tell people this,
they don't believe me.

46:20.612 --> 46:22.137
They think I'm lying.

46:22.213 --> 46:24.147
Don't be ridiculous, Dan. Of
course I'm gonna believe you.

46:24.215 --> 46:25.614
You say that now,
and that's nice,

46:25.683 --> 46:27.481
but when I say what I'm gonna
say, you're not gonna believe me.

46:27.552 --> 46:29.247
-- I'll believe you.
-- Really?

46:29.320 --> 46:32.119
I'm standing here telling you
I'll believe you.

46:32.190 --> 46:35.353
Bobbi Bernstein is convinced that a
long time ago in a hotel room in Spain

46:35.426 --> 46:37.724
she and I slept together and
that I never called her again.

46:37.795 --> 46:39.729
Now, three things
are important.

46:39.797 --> 46:41.356
I've never met
Bobbi Bernstein

46:41.432 --> 46:43.901
till she started doing
fieldwork here for the show,

46:43.968 --> 46:45.868
I've never slept
with Bobbi Bernstein,

46:45.937 --> 46:47.530
and I have never been
to Spain.

46:47.605 --> 46:50.097
-- [Chuckles]
-- Thank you for believing me.

46:50.175 --> 46:52.439
Danny...
you never called her?

46:52.510 --> 46:55.036
-- Dana, you just said that -- -- A
woman likes a phone call, Danny.

46:55.113 --> 46:56.808
All right, listen --
and there's something

46:56.881 --> 46:58.849
with the stuff you guys
are putting in your hair.

46:58.917 --> 47:01.409
Let me tell you something.
I put nothing in my hair.

47:01.486 --> 47:04.285
I was born with this hair,
and not enough people know that.

47:04.355 --> 47:06.050
Rebecca's gonna be here
tomorrow.

47:06.124 --> 47:08.252
-- Rebecca, by the way, colors her hair.
-- Dana, what...

47:08.326 --> 47:10.920
She's a lovely woman, but I'm saying
that is not her natural hair color.

47:10.995 --> 47:14.192
Nonetheless, I think I'd like to
keep her on as my girlfriend.

47:14.265 --> 47:16.324
[Laughs]

47:16.401 --> 47:18.802
Rebecca and I are in a very delicate
period of our relationship,

47:18.870 --> 47:21.567
and if she's standing around while
Bobbi Bernstein's launching into arias

47:21.639 --> 47:24.074
about how I never called her after
sleeping with her in Spain --

47:24.142 --> 47:26.042
-- You should have called her.
-- I didn't sleep with her.

47:26.110 --> 47:27.407
Flowers wouldn't have
killed you.

47:27.478 --> 47:28.741
You're gonna be no help,
are you?

47:28.813 --> 47:30.144
It doesn't look like it,
does it?

47:30.215 --> 47:31.478
No.

47:31.549 --> 47:32.948
<i>Casey: Chocolate cake</i> --

47:33.017 --> 47:35.645
chocolate-filled,
chocolate-frosted, chocolate cake.

47:35.720 --> 47:37.245
I'm just saying.

47:42.860 --> 47:44.851
<i>There are days</i> --

47:44.929 --> 47:46.021
days that separate

47:46.097 --> 47:47.360
the men from the Men.

47:47.432 --> 47:48.456
The men from the men?

47:48.533 --> 47:49.466
That's right.

47:49.534 --> 47:50.865
-- What does -- -- The second
“Men“ was with a capital

47:50.935 --> 47:52.425
-- Ah.
-- There are these days.

47:52.503 --> 47:53.937
This is one of those days.

47:54.005 --> 47:55.473
You should enjoy the moment.

47:55.540 --> 47:56.473
What moment?

47:56.541 --> 47:57.975
This moment -- the Sweet 16.

47:58.042 --> 48:01.034
-- Expanded coverage -- don't you
love expanded coverage? -- Yes.

48:01.112 --> 48:03.843
All day and all night --
a foxhole mentality.

48:03.915 --> 48:05.007
Enjoy this moment.

48:05.083 --> 48:06.141
<i>Dan: Casey.</i>

48:06.217 --> 48:07.742
I'm pumping up the troops.

48:07.819 --> 48:10.686
-- That's great. Let me talk to you.
-- All right.

48:10.755 --> 48:14.055
While I'm gone, everyone should
continue enjoying the moment.

48:14.125 --> 48:15.524
[Telephone ringing]

48:15.593 --> 48:17.687
Listen to this --
this is all I want to say,

48:17.762 --> 48:19.753
and then I'm not gonna say
anything else.

48:19.831 --> 48:22.266
I just went down
to Rebecca's office,

48:22.333 --> 48:24.768
and Steve Sisco was there.

48:26.137 --> 48:28.572
Expanded coverage
all day and all night.

48:28.640 --> 48:31.109
Maybe I'll talk about it
a little bit more than that.

48:31.175 --> 48:32.506
-- Steve Sisc0's in her office?
-- Yes.

48:32.577 --> 48:33.874
-- On a Saturday?
-- Yes.

48:33.945 --> 48:35.709
What is Steve Sisco doing
in her office on a Saturday?

48:35.780 --> 48:38.511
Who cares if it's Saturday? What's
Steve Sisco doing in her office?

48:38.583 --> 48:41.382
Hey, Rebecca, Steve Sisco,
Bobbi Bernstein --

48:41.452 --> 48:43.853
You're gonna have quite
a little day.

48:43.921 --> 48:45.252
-- Yeah, but I'm not talking about it.
-- Good.

48:45.323 --> 48:46.916
-- I'm not thinking about it.
-- Good.

48:46.991 --> 48:49.619
-- We've got a lot of hours on
the air today. -- That's right.

48:49.694 --> 48:52.288
-- The point is Steve Sisco was in Rebecca's
office on a Saturday. -- ...on a Saturday.

48:52.363 --> 48:55.663
-- My girlfriend's ex-husband was in her
office on a Saturday, and I'm fine. -- Good.

48:55.733 --> 48:57.167
And I'm not saying
I'm fine in that dramatic way

48:57.235 --> 48:58.794
that's obviously meant to
indicate that I'm not fine.

48:58.870 --> 49:00.201
That's not what I meant
when I said I'm fine.

49:00.271 --> 49:02.239
-- What did you mean?
-- I meant I'm fine.

49:02.307 --> 49:03.240
Okay.

49:03.308 --> 49:04.332
-- I am.
-- Excellent.

49:04.409 --> 49:05.706
-- Look at me.
-- I am.

49:05.777 --> 49:07.142
-- Don't I <i>look fine?</i>
-- <i>You look good.</i>

49:07.211 --> 49:08.736
-- I do. -- You're a
good-looking man, Danny.

49:08.813 --> 49:10.872
Moreover, my girlfriend's in her
office talking to her ex-husband,

49:10.948 --> 49:12.438
it's all happening on a
Saturday, and guess what.

49:12.517 --> 49:13.814
-- You're fine?
-- I'm fine.

49:13.885 --> 49:15.182
I just want you to know

49:15.253 --> 49:17.745
how frightened I am
with today's broadcast.

49:17.822 --> 49:18.812
Yeah, I hear you.

49:18.890 --> 49:19.857
A little higher.

49:19.957 --> 49:20.924
-- Me?
-- Jeremy.

49:20.992 --> 49:21.982
-- Higher?
-- Yes.

49:22.060 --> 49:23.255
-- There?
-- Too high.

49:23.328 --> 49:24.818
Actually, wait.

49:24.896 --> 49:27.194
Yes, Natalie, you go higher.
Right there.

49:27.265 --> 49:29.165
-- <i>Good?</i>
-- Yes.

49:29.233 --> 49:30.325
We can come down now?

49:30.401 --> 49:32.597
By all means, take a look.
I like it.

49:32.670 --> 49:34.229
I like the visual image,
don't you?

49:34.305 --> 49:35.898
-- The city skyline -- the banner.
-- Yes.

49:35.973 --> 49:37.134
Now here's the thing.

49:37.208 --> 49:38.835
-- What? -- I'm not
wild about the text.

49:38.910 --> 49:40.344
-- The text?
-- Yeah.

49:40.411 --> 49:41.810
-- It says, "Welcome back."
-- Right.

49:41.879 --> 49:43.347
-- What's the problem?
-- I don't know.

49:43.414 --> 49:45.246
It's a little on the nose,
don't you think?

49:45.316 --> 49:46.750
-- "Welcome back"?
-- Yeah.

49:46.818 --> 49:48.183
-- Do I think it's on the nose?
-- Yeah.

49:48.252 --> 49:49.310
I suppose I do.

49:49.387 --> 49:51.082
-- But it doesn't bother you?
-- Not that much.

49:51.155 --> 49:52.316
You know who it would bother?

49:52.390 --> 49:53.357
-- Who?
-- Casey.

49:53.424 --> 49:54.789
I think
it would bother Casey.

49:54.859 --> 49:56.793
I find Casey to be judgmental,
and in my case,

49:56.861 --> 49:58.351
I find him to be
hyper-judgmental.

49:58.429 --> 50:00.056
Did he say something
about your hair?

50:00.131 --> 50:02.122
No, he said
something about --

50:02.200 --> 50:04.294
Wait. What would he say
about my hair?

50:04.369 --> 50:06.463
Listen to this -- and this is all I'm
gonna say. Then it's the end of it.

50:06.537 --> 50:08.130
Steve Sisco is with Rebecca
in her office right now.

50:08.206 --> 50:09.367
<i>Natalie: Really?
-- Yeah.</i>

50:09.440 --> 50:10.498
On a Saturday?

50:10.575 --> 50:12.304
-- What the hell does everybody
care that -- -- Dan.

50:12.377 --> 50:13.310
I'm fine.

50:13.378 --> 50:14.709
What do you think?

50:14.779 --> 50:16.770
-- About what?
-- About the banner.

50:16.848 --> 50:17.872
I like it.

50:17.949 --> 50:19.439
-- Do you?
-- It's a good banner.

50:19.517 --> 50:21.212
You don't think
it's on the nose?

50:21.285 --> 50:22.616
-- "Welcome back"?
-- Yeah.

50:22.687 --> 50:23.848
I think it's precise.

50:23.921 --> 50:25.116
-- Really?
-- Yes.

50:25.189 --> 50:27.419
-- Thank you. -- There's
an economy of language.

50:27.492 --> 50:28.823
Oh,
and that's unusual for me,

50:28.893 --> 50:30.657
like I'm the one
who can't shut up?

50:30.728 --> 50:32.628
-- Dana... -- You're damn right
there's an economy of language.

50:32.697 --> 50:34.722
I got the job done
in two words,

50:34.799 --> 50:37.268
and I think
I can make another cut, yes.

50:37.335 --> 50:38.996
We don't need "back."

50:39.070 --> 50:40.299
We can cut the "back."

50:40.371 --> 50:41.497
-- Cut the "back"?
-- Yes.

50:41.572 --> 50:42.903
-- And have it just say, “VVelc0me“?
-- Yes.

50:42.974 --> 50:45.341
-- “VVelc0me“? -- Do you
have a problem with that?

50:45.410 --> 50:48.004
-- He'll think he just cleared customs.
-- He's got a point.

50:48.079 --> 50:49.478
What if you add
an exclamation point?

50:49.547 --> 50:51.572
I'm going to get the cake.

50:51.649 --> 50:54.482
-- Also it should be a little
higher on the right. -- Shut up!

50:54.552 --> 50:56.452
<i>Dave: Two minutes to VTR.
Three minutes live.</i>

50:56.521 --> 50:58.182
<i>Kim: We're live
in three minutes.</i>

50:58.256 --> 51:00.384
-- Let me hear 'em -- Continental Arena.
-- On one.

51:00.458 --> 51:01.983
-- Thompson-Boling.
-- Up on two.

51:02.059 --> 51:03.891
-- Trans World Dome.
-- They are coming.

51:03.961 --> 51:05.793
-- <i>America West.</i>
-- <i>On four.</i>

51:05.863 --> 51:08.525
<i>Dana, we're still waiting for Trans World
Dome, but your team's on the field.</i>

51:08.599 --> 51:10.260
I think it's strange
that Isaac isn't here.

51:10.334 --> 51:11.563
<i>When was he supposed
to get in?</i>

51:11.636 --> 51:14.230
Uh, he said he'd be here
well before the show started.

51:14.305 --> 51:15.898
The show hasn't started yet.

51:15.973 --> 51:18.135
Yeah, but he said he'd be here
well before the show started.

51:18.209 --> 51:20.041
It's now two minutes
before the show is starting.

51:20.111 --> 51:22.011
-- VVas he coming from the airport?
-- Yeah.

51:22.079 --> 51:23.069
Maybe he stopped off.

51:23.147 --> 51:24.615
-- Where?
-- For a pretzel.

51:24.682 --> 51:26.377
I'm serious.
He was supposed to --

51:26.451 --> 51:28.510
VVell, he has been in Europe for 2 weeks.
He hasn't had a decent pretzel.

51:28.586 --> 51:30.213
Maybe he stopped off, and that
was the cause for the delay.

51:30.288 --> 51:31.687
And how long does it take
to buy a pretzel?

51:31.756 --> 51:34.350
Well, you've punctured
a hole in my theory.

51:34.425 --> 51:36.689
-- Also Bobbi isn't here yet.
-- She <i>called</i> from the car.

51:36.761 --> 51:38.229
-- And?
-- Stopped off for a pretzel.

51:38.296 --> 51:39.525
-- Jeremy.
-- She's on her way in.

51:39.597 --> 51:42.532
<i>Dave: Roll VTR.
45 seconds live.</i>

51:42.600 --> 51:45.069
This day has got
the earmarks, Casey.

51:46.504 --> 51:48.199
Where's Rebecca?
I ask you that.

51:48.272 --> 51:50.866
She was gonna come by
and hang out for a little bit,

51:50.942 --> 51:53.775
yet she's down in her office
hanging outwith Steve Sisco.

51:53.845 --> 51:55.643
But you're fine.

52:00.885 --> 52:04.412
Rebecca isn't here.
Isaac isn't here.

52:07.058 --> 52:09.152
There's a strangeness
about this day.

52:09.227 --> 52:11.559
<i>30 seconds live.</i>

52:14.265 --> 52:15.755
Eli's coming.

52:17.502 --> 52:18.663
Eli?

52:18.736 --> 52:20.465
From the Three Dog Night
song.

52:20.538 --> 52:22.006
<i>Yes;?</i>

52:22.073 --> 52:24.064
Eli is something bad,
a darkness.

52:24.141 --> 52:26.303
"Eli's coming.
Hide your heart, girl."

52:26.377 --> 52:27.936
Eli's an inveterate womanizer.

52:28.012 --> 52:30.174
I think you're getting
the song wrong.

52:30.248 --> 52:32.080
I know I'm getting
the song wrong,

52:32.149 --> 52:34.914
but when I first heard it,
that's what I thought it meant.

52:34.986 --> 52:36.852
Things stick with you
that way.

52:36.921 --> 52:38.912
<i>In 3...2...</i>

52:38.990 --> 52:41.186
Good afternoon.
From New York City,

52:41.259 --> 52:43.626
I'm Casey McCall
alongside Dan Rydell.

52:43.694 --> 52:45.958
Lions, Tigers, and Bearcats!
Oh, my!

52:46.030 --> 52:47.361
We've got expanded coverage

52:47.431 --> 52:49.490
of the NCAA men's
basketball tournament,

52:49.567 --> 52:51.228
A.K.A. "March Madness."

52:51.302 --> 52:54.363
We'll be taking you to Knoxville,
East Rutherford, and St. Louis,

52:54.438 --> 52:56.338
where the Jayhawks
are about to tip-off,

52:56.407 --> 52:59.035
and we want to bring you up to date
on some developments out in Phoenix.

52:59.110 --> 53:01.602
So we're gonna take you to the America
VVest Arena right after this.

53:01.679 --> 53:06.549
You're watching a special Saturday
expanded edition of “Sports Night“ on CSC.

53:06.617 --> 53:08.551
We're just getting started,
so stick around.

53:08.619 --> 53:09.711
We're out.

53:09.787 --> 53:11.551
<i>Kim: Two minutes back.</i>

53:11.622 --> 53:14.922
They say it's always calmest
before the storm.

53:14.992 --> 53:16.187
That's not true.

53:16.260 --> 53:17.785
I'm a serious sailor.

53:17.862 --> 53:21.025
It isn't calm before the storm.
Stuff happens.

53:21.098 --> 53:22.691
Look who's here.

53:23.901 --> 53:25.232
Hi, Casey.

53:25.303 --> 53:26.737
<i>Hey, Bobbi.</i>

53:26.804 --> 53:29.205
Hello, Dan.

53:33.210 --> 53:36.043
Eli's coming.

53:45.656 --> 53:46.714
[Sighs]

53:56.100 --> 53:57.727
How are you doin'?

53:57.802 --> 53:59.429
I'm fine, Dan.

53:59.503 --> 54:01.198
I'm doing fine.

54:01.272 --> 54:03.138
<i>Dave." In 3...2...</i>

54:03.207 --> 54:04.641
Hello again.

54:04.709 --> 54:06.177
We'll send you back to
Knoxville in just a moment,

54:06.243 --> 54:09.304
but first I'm joined by
CSC analyst Bobbi Bernstein.

54:09.380 --> 54:13.044
Bobbi, is Virginia's first-half
press a surprise to anyone?

54:13.117 --> 54:16.178
Dan, the Cavs came out on defense doing
exactly what they said they'd do,

54:16.253 --> 54:17.778
and that's contain
Martin McMurtry.

54:17.855 --> 54:20.324
Let's go to the first-half
videotape, where you could see...

54:20.391 --> 54:21.552
What do you know?

54:21.626 --> 54:23.390
They said his plane landed
four hours ago.

54:23.461 --> 54:24.622
And there's no answer
at the house?

54:24.695 --> 54:25.628
No.

54:25.696 --> 54:26.959
<i>Jeremy: Dana, no kidding.</i>

54:27.031 --> 54:28.590
Saturday night,
coming in from JFK,

54:28.666 --> 54:30.998
if he took the Triboro,
four hours wouldn't be a record.

54:31.068 --> 54:32.900
Yeah, okay.

54:32.970 --> 54:35.064
Elliott, call the airline.
Call Heathrow.

54:35.139 --> 54:36.903
-- See if he got on the plane.
-- Okay.

54:36.974 --> 54:39.272
<i>Bobbi: ...down by six
with McMurtry posting up,</i>

54:39.343 --> 54:41.004
<i>and the defense
just collapses on him.</i>

54:41.078 --> 54:43.206
That's what Virginia's
been doing all season, Dan,

54:43.280 --> 54:45.647
and that's what Georgia Tech
is gonna see all night long.

54:45.716 --> 54:47.241
And how's Rebecca's ankle?

54:48.252 --> 54:49.583
I'm sorry.

54:49.654 --> 54:53.022
Rick...O'Brien --
how's Rick O'Brien's ankle?

54:53.090 --> 54:56.321
X-rays are negative, and O'Brien could
see some action in the second half.

54:56.394 --> 54:57.327
Thanks very much.

54:57.395 --> 54:59.363
Bobbi Bernstein will be with us
throughout the evening

54:59.430 --> 55:02.024
as we send you back to Thompson-Boling
Arena in Knoxville, Tennessee.

55:02.099 --> 55:03.191
<i>Dave." We're out.</i>

55:03.267 --> 55:04.462
Sorry about that.

55:04.535 --> 55:06.003
Don't worry about it.

55:09.373 --> 55:13.105
It's hard not to notice you're
a little calmer than usual.

55:13.177 --> 55:14.235
Look, Danny --

55:14.311 --> 55:16.780
I know you're worried
I'm gonna go turbo on you.

55:16.847 --> 55:17.837
It's really okay.

55:17.915 --> 55:19.440
-- What's really okay?
-- It.

55:19.517 --> 55:20.643
-- It?
-- <i>Yes.</i>

55:20.718 --> 55:22.516
Bobbi, I don't think --

55:22.586 --> 55:24.281
I don't know why you're
pretending you don't remember.

55:24.355 --> 55:26.824
You're obviously
not addleminded.

55:26.891 --> 55:27.881
[Sighs]

55:27.958 --> 55:30.086
Let's just forget it.

55:30.161 --> 55:31.890
No, let's not forget it.

55:31.962 --> 55:34.590
You know, I've done enough
rotten things to women I like.

55:34.665 --> 55:36.861
There's no question
I'm going straight to hell.

55:36.934 --> 55:39.164
I don't really need you
padding the ballot box.

55:39.236 --> 55:42.365
-- Dan... -- The reason I never called
you after sleeping with you in Spain

55:42.440 --> 55:44.101
is that I've never slept
with you in Spain.

55:44.175 --> 55:47.236
And the reason I never slept with you in
Spain is that I've never been to Spain.

55:47.311 --> 55:48.779
And the next time
you bring this up,

55:48.846 --> 55:50.473
you better be on
with the photograph of me

55:50.548 --> 55:52.710
in a hotel room
with you in Spain.

55:53.784 --> 55:55.047
That's me.

55:55.119 --> 55:57.679
Yes. Can you read
what it says on the towel?

56:00.091 --> 56:01.490
"Hotel de Espafia"?

56:01.559 --> 56:03.493
Yes.

56:03.561 --> 56:05.723
-- The Hotel de Espafia is in Spain?
-- Yes.

56:05.796 --> 56:07.560
Can I have
that picture back now?

56:07.631 --> 56:08.860
Wait a second.

56:10.568 --> 56:14.368
That's me.
That's me in this picture...

56:14.438 --> 56:16.031
-- but that's not you.
-- Yes, it is.

56:16.107 --> 56:17.734
-- No, it's not. I know this girl.
-- Yeah.

56:17.808 --> 56:19.071
-- Mnh-mnh. I know this girl.
-- Yes.

56:19.143 --> 56:20.872
Her name's Roberta.

56:27.785 --> 56:29.378
Oh, holy cow.

56:29.453 --> 56:32.047
Bobbi Bernstein.
Nice to meet you.

56:34.291 --> 56:37.420
Bobbi, this looks
nothing like you. I-| --

56:37.495 --> 56:39.088
Yeah.

56:39.163 --> 56:40.653
I mean --

56:40.731 --> 56:43.029
I turned into quite the babe,
didn't I?

56:49.006 --> 56:50.667
Look, I --
I mean, I --

56:50.741 --> 56:52.470
-- Honestly, I...
-- Yeah.

56:52.543 --> 56:54.375
-- <i>My ankle's fine.</i>
-- <i>Hey!</i>

56:54.445 --> 56:57.540
Put some ice on it, shot me up with
cortisone, and I'm good to go.

56:57.615 --> 56:59.879
This is Rebecca VVells. She works
downstairs. Bobbi Bernstein.

56:59.950 --> 57:01.782
-- <i>Hi.</i>
-- <i>Nice to meet you.</i>

57:01.852 --> 57:02.910
You have time for coffee?

57:02.987 --> 57:04.477
Nat, do I have
a little time?

57:04.555 --> 57:05.647
<i>Natalie." 4 1/2 minutes.</i>

57:05.723 --> 57:07.213
I'm gonna look at tape.

57:07.291 --> 57:09.055
Yeah.

57:11.562 --> 57:13.690
-- Can I make you a sandwich?
-- No, thanks.

57:13.764 --> 57:16.529
-- In fact, I really didn't even want
coffee. -- We have espresso and cappuccino.

57:16.600 --> 57:19.228
-- What I meant was -- -- And due to a
budget surplus, I can now offer you latte.

57:19.303 --> 57:22.273
-- Dan... -- But it's gonna look and taste an
awful lot like the espresso and cappuccino.

57:22.339 --> 57:23.966
-- Danny.
-- In there.

57:31.048 --> 57:32.516
Was that weird for you?

57:32.583 --> 57:33.846
Seeing Steve Sisco
in your office?

57:33.918 --> 57:34.885
-- Yes.
-- No.

57:34.952 --> 57:35.919
-- Really?
-- Yes.

57:35.986 --> 57:36.976
-- It wasn't?
-- No.

57:37.054 --> 57:38.681
-- It wasn't weird for you?
-- No.

57:40.758 --> 57:41.987
It was weird for me.

57:42.059 --> 57:43.652
-- Don't you want to ask me
why he was there? -- No.

57:43.761 --> 57:45.354
-- Really?
-- It's none of my business.

57:45.396 --> 57:46.955
-- It's a little your business. --
We've been dating for two weeks.

57:47.031 --> 57:48.692
He was in my office
on a Saturday.

57:48.766 --> 57:50.359
Why does everyone care
it's Saturday?

57:50.434 --> 57:53.199
VVould it have been okay if he'd
been in your office on a Tuesday?

57:53.270 --> 57:54.431
-- I mean...
-- Would it?

57:54.505 --> 57:56.439
It's none of my business.

57:56.507 --> 57:58.441
So you don't want to know why he
was in my office on a Saturday?

57:58.509 --> 57:59.635
No.

58:02.046 --> 58:03.878
Why was he in your office
on a Saturday?

58:03.948 --> 58:06.178
Danny, Steve and I
aren't divorced.

58:06.250 --> 58:07.740
You're not?

58:07.818 --> 58:09.115
No.

58:09.186 --> 58:10.620
You're married?

58:10.688 --> 58:12.213
We're separated.

58:14.291 --> 58:15.759
I see.

58:15.826 --> 58:17.692
-- Are you upset?
-- No.

58:17.761 --> 58:19.627
-- Really?
-- Yes.

58:19.697 --> 58:22.029
Eh, get away from me
with that thing, huh?

58:22.099 --> 58:23.828
Of course I'm upset.

58:23.901 --> 58:25.528
What, are you nuts? Huh?

58:25.603 --> 58:28.573
Are you -- are you just some
nutty nut girl who's nuts?

58:28.639 --> 58:31.665
<i>There's a difference between
divorced and separated.</i>

58:31.742 --> 58:33.107
One is divorced,
the other is separated.

58:33.177 --> 58:34.872
That's why they have
those names.

58:34.945 --> 58:38.711
I never imagined in a building populated
by me, you, Dana, Casey, Jeremy, Natalie,

58:38.782 --> 58:41.547
Bobbi Bernstein would turn out
to be the sanest person here.

58:41.619 --> 58:44.145
Separated means you're thinking
about getting divorced.

58:44.255 --> 58:46.883
It also means you're thinking
about not getting divorced.

58:46.924 --> 58:49.359
-- Are you finished?
-- No, I'm not finished.

58:50.694 --> 58:52.219
Yes, I'm finished.

58:52.296 --> 58:53.786
I'm sorry I lied to you.

58:53.864 --> 58:56.333
If it's any consolation,
I never felt like I was lying.

58:56.400 --> 58:58.494
I felt like I was
withholding the truth.

58:58.569 --> 59:01.800
Yeah, that's a huge
consolation, Rebecca.

59:01.872 --> 59:04.341
<i>Kim: Dan, 60 seconds.</i>

59:04.408 --> 59:06.035
[Sighs ] So, what was
he in your office for, huh?

59:06.110 --> 59:07.544
It was nothing, right?
He just stopped by?

59:07.611 --> 59:09.636
-- He wants to go to counseling.
-- Let me tell you something.

59:09.713 --> 59:11.078
That guy could use
some counseling.

59:11.148 --> 59:13.207
I mean he is -- among other things
-- an inveterate womanizer,

59:13.284 --> 59:15.514
not unlike the title character from
the song by Three Dog Night --

59:15.586 --> 59:17.452
if you choose to look at it
that way, which I don't.

59:17.521 --> 59:19.990
I see it as a portent
of something dark,

59:20.057 --> 59:22.754
but that's not
what you meant by counseling.

59:22.826 --> 59:24.385
No.

59:24.461 --> 59:26.190
He wants to go
to couples counseling?

59:26.263 --> 59:28.163
Yes.

59:28.232 --> 59:29.791
With you?

59:29.867 --> 59:30.925
Yes.

59:32.937 --> 59:34.666
I gotta go back on the air.

59:34.738 --> 59:36.172
-- Danny...
-- Just a second.

59:36.240 --> 59:38.072
I'll be right back.

59:40.678 --> 59:41.941
[Sighs]

59:42.012 --> 59:44.947
-- <i>We're in the studio in 20.</i>
