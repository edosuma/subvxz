I mean s, I'veeen the picturet
ofhe rocks, you know,

28:34.980 --> 28:36.346
but that's about it.

28:36.414 --> 28:38.148
Seems like a lot of work

28:38.217 --> 28:41.051
for somebooudy
thsands of years ago

28:41.053 --> 28:46.557
to lift up 50-ton rocks
to look at some stars.

28:46.625 --> 28:48.258
Aliens.

28:48.326 --> 28:51.094

UdWow, de.

At ongst the ruins of Britain's
most famous ancient monument,

29:05.377 --> 29:07.878
druidsra celebte
the longest day of the year.

29:11.783 --> 29:15.753
Stohenge is a circle
of humongous stones.

29:15.788 --> 29:17.554
Ou Obvisly, the.
Onumberne question is,

29:17.622 --> 29:20.290
how the hell dthid
ese stones get here,

29:20.358 --> 29:22.592
and wh
at isthe significance of th?

29:22.595 --> 29:24.472
When you go to Stonehenge
and you toucsth the ones,

29:24.496 --> 29:26.063
which I have, u and yothink,

29:26.131 --> 29:28.064
"Wow, this is like
5,000 years old."

29:28.067 --> 29:31.802
Something that old from
a civilization so far ago

29:31.870 --> 29:33.704
is still heruse for to see.

29:37.642 --> 29:39.143
T' Les go.

29:39.211 --> 29:40.477
Right bohere, y.

29:43.649 --> 29:46.149
Aliens.
Says so right there on the wall.

29:46.218 --> 29:48.451
I me an, you think about it.

29:48.520 --> 29:53.824
Movin' a four-ton stone
by hand 150 miles.

29:53.892 --> 29:55.926
I can barely push my cat
outta bed.

29:58.297 --> 29:59.113
I have issues, lruike, bshin'
my teeth in the mornin'.

29:59.114 --> 30:00.834

30:02.400 --> 30:03.316
Right, um, well, good morning,

30:03.317 --> 30:04.233
My name'ans Juli Richards. At
I'm an archeologist.razy.

30:04.303 --> 30:05.969
I've been invon lved iStonehenge

30:06.038 --> 30:10.841
and this landscape
for 38 yowears n,

30:10.909 --> 30:13.944
and it still exerts
a massive fascination for me.

30:16.715 --> 30:17.598
First answer is, to no, Snehenge
was not created bys. Alien

30:17.599 --> 30:18.482
alt wasn't created p
a masbyeople like theseor me.

30:18.550 --> 30:21.318
Who turned up
at Stonehenge at intervals,

30:21.386 --> 30:23.954
because Stonehenge is a place
that inspires people,

30:24.022 --> 30:27.524
it inspires ideas,
itre inspis theory.

30:27.526 --> 30:29.059
Look at that.

30:29.061 --> 30:31.195
- ThYeah, at is cool.
- That is cool.

30:31.263 --> 30:34.264
LI feelike this is when the
spaceship me down right here.

30:36.568 --> 30:37.467
Yeah.

30:37.536 --> 30:38.669
So, see the inner stones?

30:38.737 --> 30:40.181
L Theyook...
OoThey lk teeny from here.

30:40.205 --> 30:41.304
Those are the blue rocks.

30:41.373 --> 30:42.373
Yeah.

30:42.440 --> 30:44.007
Wow.

30:44.076 --> 30:46.476
There's no quarries, there's
no stones like that around here,

30:48.446 --> 30:49.596
so they ddragge
all these in here.

30:49.597 --> 30:50.791
ThAnd where do you find stones
no stonethat are so square? Here,

30:50.815 --> 30:52.916
ke Li, did they have,
like, hammers and chisels

30:52.984 --> 30:54.384
ye5,000 ars ago?

30:54.452 --> 30:56.019
They had rocks.
They hwiit it th rocks.

30:56.088 --> 30:58.255
Those are a foot
from each other,

30:58.323 --> 31:00.390
lined keup, li,
perfectly parallel.

31:00.458 --> 31:01.692
It is no joke.

31:01.760 --> 31:02.960
Yeah, that's nuts.

31:03.028 --> 31:04.261
Yeatah, th's... Ba-ba.

31:07.098 --> 31:08.699
Big rocks.

31:11.269 --> 31:13.203
D How olis Stonehenge?
I mean, we've all heard...

31:13.271 --> 31:15.572
Well, th-thetey stard off
diggintcg a dih

31:15.640 --> 31:18.008
and a bankabout 5,000 years ago,

31:19.911 --> 31:20.827
so 3 B, 000C. Ye.

31:20.828 --> 31:21.744
Then the big
a stone structures, ears ago,

31:21.813 --> 31:24.047
h whicare what everybody
thinks Stonehenge is,

31:24.116 --> 31:26.516
theaey appred about
500 years after that.

31:26.584 --> 31:28.852
And that's right at the end
of the Stone Age,

31:28.921 --> 31:30.453
right at the end
of the Neolithic.

31:30.456 --> 31:33.757
But then they carried on
using it and modifying it

31:33.825 --> 31:36.237
for several hundred ye ars after that.
Brought in more stones.

31:36.261 --> 31:38.729
Doin we thk it has something
to do with the stars,

31:38.797 --> 31:40.998
and, I mea n...
It's the... It's the sun.

31:41.066 --> 31:44.768
The sun. Because the
alignment down the avenue

31:44.836 --> 31:47.137
and into tsehe horshoe
of stones,

31:47.139 --> 31:50.206
that's the midsummer sunrise on
the longest... On the solstice.

31:50.209 --> 31:52.253
Yeah... the summer solstice,
longesoft day the year.

31:52.277 --> 31:53.877
But more importantly,

31:53.945 --> 31:57.414
the winter solstice D
onecember the 21st

31:57.416 --> 31:58.581
ca beuse that's...

31:58.650 --> 31:59.950
I'm convinced that is methe ti

32:00.018 --> 32:01.751
tothat Snehenge was built for.

32:01.820 --> 32:03.420
Light, life...

32:03.422 --> 32:05.262
'causeun the s is life, isn't it?
Right, right.

32:05.323 --> 32:07.290
You know that the sun
inis comg back.

32:07.293 --> 32:10.627
So it's that turning point,
the swinterolstice,

32:10.629 --> 32:12.996
that's the key...
That's the kStey to onehenge.

32:13.064 --> 32:14.164
Wow. Okay.

32:16.168 --> 32:17.801

32:22.240 --> 32:24.241
Leaving Stonehenge,
it's incredible to think

32:24.309 --> 32:27.077
thatth with e desire to explore
meaning in this world,

32:27.145 --> 32:30.247
our ancestors built something
they had no model for.

32:35.720 --> 32:36.742
And at its core,
it's a celebration

32:36.743 --> 32:37.765
ourof the light and warmthing
that the sun still brings us.

32:37.766 --> 32:38.833
It makes them seem suddenly
not so different from us.

32:38.857 --> 32:41.458
I expected it to be on
a mountaintop or something.

32:41.460 --> 32:43.159

His buttocks. I do.

35:18.150 --> 35:19.430
I grab his buttocks quite a bit.

35:19.484 --> 35:20.628
- Jeffrey, good to meet you.
- Hi.

35:20.652 --> 35:21.985
Ian's music has always

35:22.053 --> 35:24.821
transcended genres
by doing the unexpected.

35:24.823 --> 35:28.258
Adluding fte to hard rock,
he helped make Jethro Tull

35:28.293 --> 35:30.961
one of the most memorable
bands of all time.

35:31.029 --> 35:33.096
Someone hawith tt much genius,

35:33.098 --> 35:35.465
you'd expect itot
rub off on Andy,

35:35.533 --> 35:37.167
but, you know,
we're still waiting.

35:37.235 --> 35:39.502
Let's go and see if we can
grab u some, h... cup of tea

35:39.505 --> 35:40.681
or something of interest.
That'll be awesome.

35:40.705 --> 35:41.771
What a beautiful home.

35:44.443 --> 35:46.576
This is inamazg.

35:46.645 --> 35:49.646
How old isho this use?
When was it originally built?

35:49.714 --> 35:51.248
Well, this is not an old.

35:51.316 --> 35:54.384
The one d we useto livwaen
s, 16th century.

35:54.452 --> 35:55.485
Wow.

35:55.553 --> 35:57.620
So, that was kind of old.

35:57.689 --> 35:58.821
But this is a new house.

35:58.890 --> 36:00.857
It's, I 1751, think.

36:00.926 --> 36:04.995
New house... 1751.

36:05.063 --> 36:07.497
Yeah, well, people imagine,
I suppose, that, you know,

36:07.565 --> 36:09.732
it's the rock-adstar p,
you know,

36:09.801 --> 36:12.869
and there'd be some
sort of, uich, musal equivalent

36:12.871 --> 36:14.537
to Hugh Hefner's man
sion, but it...

36:14.606 --> 36:16.606
Right... it's... it's
actually comp oletelypposite.

36:16.675 --> 36:18.474
I'm up early 'cause I have
to feed the chickens,

36:18.477 --> 36:21.377
so u it's, h... life is really
rather pedantic and boring.

36:21.446 --> 36:23.079
Do you record here at all, or...

36:23.147 --> 36:24.814
Yeah, I have a studio in the, um.
U Yodo?

36:24.883 --> 36:26.883
Wh-which we use mostly
for rehearsals.

36:26.885 --> 36:29.019
But it'd be really nice
if we got a cup of tea.

36:29.087 --> 36:31.288

to come here and see if

36:31.356 --> 36:32.800

Tell me honestly what you think.

Peculiarly British thing

37:02.053 --> 37:03.213
- I like it.

37:03.255 --> 37:04.887
It's a secret recipe,

37:04.956 --> 37:05.855
and it's a very powerful taste.
It tastes like a...

37:05.924 --> 37:06.923
Like a waffle, kind of.

37:06.925 --> 37:08.225
It's... it's like a

37:08.260 --> 37:09.859
it's like a sort of pancake
on steroids.

37:09.861 --> 37:11.628

37:51.002 --> 37:52.969

37:52.971 --> 37:55.016
that I'll play on somebody's
record if they asked me,

37:55.040 --> 37:56.973
if I like it,
if it's a challenge,

37:56.975 --> 37:58.641
if it's something different,

37:58.710 --> 38:00.310
but I don't wanna
be paid for it.

38:00.378 --> 38:02.111

39:34.673 --> 39:36.739
and tear uing itp

39:36.808 --> 39:39.476
it's punk clmeets assical...

39:39.544 --> 39:42.945
Just the kind of thing
I'd expect from Ian.

39:42.948 --> 39:46.015
And doing it with some of
my favorite peoplee in thworld?

39:46.017 --> 39:48.151
It doesn't gteet betr than this.

39:52.424 --> 39:54.023
Th aat waswesome.

39:54.025 --> 39:55.269

40:21.953 --> 40:24.120
Have you always wanted

40:24.188 --> 40:25.321
Th Pat waslan "C."

40:25.389 --> 40:27.223
Plan "A" bwas toe a policeman.

40:27.291 --> 40:29.759
Why? Why'd you have
tha at as desire? Like...

40:29.827 --> 40:32.795
I... Just, Ise suppo, because,
ultimately, I'm...

40:32.864 --> 40:35.198
I'm...
I'm... I'm not 'a rockn' ro.

40:35.266 --> 40:36.966
I'm a law-abiding citizen.

40:37.034 --> 40:40.437
And being on tour as a rock star
and you see so many things

40:40.472 --> 40:42.238
a thatren't by-the-book
and law-abiding,

40:42.240 --> 40:43.940
like, what do you think?

40:43.942 --> 40:46.075
I... Py robablbecause I don't
actually see them that much.

40:46.077 --> 40:47.844
- You don't?
- I-Ith read e stories.

40:47.846 --> 40:49.645
We were on to...

40:49.714 --> 40:52.215
We... We wersue the pport actLe
for d Zeppelin back in 1969...

40:52.283 --> 40:53.283
Mo.

40:53.351 --> 40:54.451
And torhe rum was

40:54.486 --> 40:56.886
that it was a wild, crazy, yo

40:56.955 --> 40:59.088
u know, ride that they were on.

40:59.156 --> 41:02.325
The... The stories of Zeppelin
in hotels is kind of legendary.

41:02.393 --> 41:03.593
Yeah. Ou - Y didn't wanna be

41:03.661 --> 41:05.261
onam the se floor
as John Bonham,

41:05.329 --> 41:07.530
because his...
His schtick was to go

41:07.598 --> 41:09.799
and, you know, pee in the ice mach.
The ice machines.

41:09.867 --> 41:11.701
Just for a bit of a laugh.

41:11.703 --> 41:14.637
And, um, so there was that
kind o of sidef it...

41:14.706 --> 41:17.173
Right... that, partly was,
really ' rockn' roll, but...

41:17.175 --> 41:19.642
That can't be your craziest
rock 'n' roll story.

41:19.710 --> 41:22.245
Y as thesaid, what happens
on the crew bus

41:22.313 --> 41:23.980
stayhes on t crew bus.

41:26.785 --> 41:29.185
Do you eeinjoy bng on to ur,
or you don't enjoy it?

41:29.254 --> 41:30.854
It'sli just ke
everything else, isn't it?

41:30.922 --> 41:32.121
It's a bit of
a love/hatg, e thin

41:32.123 --> 41:33.523
where you...
You know, you think,

41:33.591 --> 41:35.458
"Thank God tovhat's er.

41:35.527 --> 41:37.638
"I don't have to do that again
for another week." th Ank you.

41:39.063 --> 41:41.030
By four or five
days down the line,

41:41.098 --> 41:43.377
you're kind of getting a little twitchy.
A little itchy? Yeah.

41:43.401 --> 41:45.134
Then you gotta get out there again.
Yeah.

41:45.202 --> 41:48.004
But I'm... no You kw,
I'm... I'm now 70 years old,

41:48.006 --> 41:50.339
and... and the band's been
going for 50 years.

41:50.408 --> 41:52.141
That's amazing, yeah.
A It's kind of a...

41:52.209 --> 41:54.010
You think, how l... howong can t?

41:54.078 --> 41:56.646
Or is it just sordme wei
obsession you can't give up?

41:58.416 --> 41:59.782
- Yea fh.
- Iind it crazy.

41:59.783 --> 42:01.194
Like, my... my son's 18 now,
and he listense to thmusicp?

42:01.218 --> 42:03.219
Thatte I lisned to
when I was 18.

42:03.221 --> 42:06.389
Yeah, well, that's the strange
heritage, isn't it? Good music.

42:06.457 --> 42:08.658
Yeah,
yeah. -The things that you hor

42:12.564 --> 42:13.947
asmu, sicians
or as actors or as writers.

42:13.948 --> 42:15.375
Yor whatever you do yeah.
Thin the creative arts,

42:15.399 --> 42:17.600
it becomes a bit timeless,
you know, in the sense

42:17.668 --> 42:19.368
hethat tre are
these absolutes almost,

42:19.371 --> 42:21.103
that the great things
that were done,

42:21.106 --> 42:22.772
even if it was
before you wrnere bo...

42:22.840 --> 42:24.200
- Yeah.
- It's so accessible now.

42:24.241 --> 42:27.510
Right.
The more time I spend here,

42:27.579 --> 42:30.513
the more I realizeat
th Britain's rigid heritage

42:30.581 --> 42:33.082
has inadvertently provided
the perfect breeding ground

42:33.150 --> 42:36.085
r foits subversive attitudes.

42:36.154 --> 42:37.587
The weighiht of story
drives people

42:37.655 --> 42:39.355
to push harder and e, xplore

42:39.424 --> 42:43.092
to find the passion to c
reate and influence cultur,

42:43.160 --> 42:45.094
and that adds a strength
and clarity

42:45.130 --> 42:47.296
I've rarely found elsewhere.

42:47.365 --> 42:50.132
Right here, it's definitely
the real thing.

42:55.172 --> 42:57.139
I can't beliAneve dy
knows how to ride this whole.

42:57.142 --> 42:59.275
