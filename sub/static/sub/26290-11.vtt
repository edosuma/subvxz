WEBVTT

00:01.523 --> 00:02.741
- I'm starving.

00:02.785 --> 00:04.004
- Really,
after what just happened?

00:04.047 --> 00:05.570
- I did my job.

00:05.614 --> 00:08.269
- You sentenced a 24-year-old
man to life in prison.

00:08.312 --> 00:11.794
- I sentenced a 24-year-old
hitman to life in prison.

00:11.837 --> 00:15.276
He killed a rival gangster
and his 10-year-old daughter.

00:15.319 --> 00:17.756
Trust me, I'm okay
with him being in prison

00:17.800 --> 00:18.931
for the rest of his life.

00:18.975 --> 00:21.325
- You're such badass.

00:21.369 --> 00:24.328
- Want some Chinese food?

00:34.164 --> 00:37.646
Look, I know last night was
tough, but you'll be fine.

00:37.689 --> 00:40.257
- I know.
I just feel so stupid.

00:40.301 --> 00:42.085
- It's not your fault.

00:42.129 --> 00:43.869
Sometimes bad things happen
to good people.

00:46.002 --> 00:48.178
- I swear someone's
following us.

00:50.485 --> 00:54.054
Sorry, Mom,
I'm just a little off today.

00:54.097 --> 00:56.230
- It's okay, sweetie.
Come on.

00:56.273 --> 00:58.058
We're almost there.

00:58.101 --> 01:02.758
I know it's a cliché,
but life is short.

01:02.801 --> 01:06.544
You gotta find joy
in every day, every moment.

01:18.904 --> 01:20.689
- Hey, thanks for coming down.

01:20.732 --> 01:23.518
My captain wanted me to get you
guys in the loop right away.

01:23.561 --> 01:25.259
It's a federal judge.

01:25.302 --> 01:27.391
Only the fifth time this ever
happened in the United States.

01:27.435 --> 01:29.567
Can you believe it?

01:29.611 --> 01:31.569
- Who's the other woman?

01:31.613 --> 01:32.831
- Her daughter.

01:35.007 --> 01:37.053
- Any witnesses?
- No.

01:37.097 --> 01:38.663
Well, not yet anyway.
We're still canvassing the area

01:38.707 --> 01:40.143
and looking for video.

01:40.187 --> 01:42.450
Whatever we find,
we'll send your way.

01:42.493 --> 01:44.147
- Gucci purse next
to the mother,

01:44.191 --> 01:46.193
Rolex watch on
the daughter's wrist.

01:46.236 --> 01:48.804
- Yeah, it doesn't look like
the perp stole a damn thing.

01:53.983 --> 01:56.028
- Execution of a federal judge
and her daughter

01:56.072 --> 01:57.639
five blocks from
the courthouse.

01:57.682 --> 01:59.554
Feels more like Juárez
than Manhattan.

01:59.597 --> 02:01.251
- We need to move fast
and make a statement.

02:01.295 --> 02:02.644
You go after a judge
and their family,

02:02.687 --> 02:04.167
we will bury you
by the end of the day.

02:04.211 --> 02:05.908
- I couldn't agree more.
We're already looking into

02:05.951 --> 02:08.389
Judge Chapman's recent rulings,
verdicts, threats.

02:08.432 --> 02:10.347
I'll let you know the second we
have anything actionable.

02:10.391 --> 02:12.349
- Okay.

02:12.393 --> 02:14.612
Look,
I just want to be upfront.

02:14.656 --> 02:17.267
I have known Leslie Chapman
for years.

02:17.311 --> 02:19.530
We go way back to when
she was a prosecutor

02:19.574 --> 02:21.445
at the U.S. Attorney's Office.

02:21.489 --> 02:23.273
- I'm really sorry
to hear that.

02:23.317 --> 02:24.796
- She was a great lady.

02:24.840 --> 02:28.539
Strong, honest,
and independent.

02:28.583 --> 02:30.498
I want to nail
the son of a bitch

02:30.541 --> 02:31.847
who did this.

02:35.067 --> 02:37.113
Oh, Mike, I'm so sorry.

02:37.157 --> 02:40.160
I can't even imagine
what you're going through.

02:40.203 --> 02:42.771
- I can't believe they're gone.

02:42.814 --> 02:44.294
Doesn't seem real.

02:44.338 --> 02:45.513
- We're gonna do
everything possible

02:45.556 --> 02:46.731
to find out who did this.

02:46.775 --> 02:48.124
I give you my word.

02:48.168 --> 02:49.299
In the meantime,
I think it's better

02:49.343 --> 02:50.909
if you stay inside,
stay here,

02:50.953 --> 02:53.347
and we're gonna
provide security.

02:53.390 --> 02:55.262
- Security?
What are you talking about?

02:55.305 --> 02:58.047
- Well, whoever did this might
be coming for you next.

02:58.090 --> 03:01.355
We don't know that for sure,
of course, but...

03:01.398 --> 03:03.183
it's a distinct possibility.

03:03.226 --> 03:04.749
- Well, let 'em come.

03:04.793 --> 03:09.667
I'd be happy to stare down
the coward who did this.

03:11.408 --> 03:12.670
- Mike, if you're up for it,

03:12.714 --> 03:13.845
we'd like to ask
a few questions,

03:13.889 --> 03:15.456
because the more we know

03:15.499 --> 03:17.806
the faster we can apprehend
whoever did this.

03:19.329 --> 03:22.506
- As you may know, a man,
Carlos Vertiz,

03:22.550 --> 03:24.856
threatened your wife three
months ago in her courtroom.

03:24.900 --> 03:27.685
- My wife wasn't, um...

03:29.209 --> 03:33.256
Easily intimidated.
She, uh...

03:33.300 --> 03:34.562
so the thought
of some idiot

03:34.605 --> 03:37.347
jumping up and down
in the courtroom...

03:37.391 --> 03:40.220
spewing threats...

03:40.263 --> 03:41.960
as crazy as that sounds,

03:42.004 --> 03:44.572
that wasn't the kind of thing
that would bother her.

03:46.269 --> 03:47.618
- I can attest to that.

03:47.662 --> 03:50.273
I never saw Leslie flustered
or even nervous.

03:52.667 --> 03:54.408
- Do you know if, in the past
few weeks,

03:54.451 --> 03:58.325
she received any unusual
phone calls, emails, texts?

04:00.327 --> 04:03.068
- No, not that I know of.

04:03.112 --> 04:04.940
- What about your daughter?

04:06.507 --> 04:10.075
- Was there anything unusual
happening in her life?

04:12.687 --> 04:13.992
No.

04:14.036 --> 04:17.561
No, she, um...

04:17.605 --> 04:20.172
She quit her job at
Goldman Sachs a few months ago.

04:20.216 --> 04:22.871
She...

04:22.914 --> 04:28.224
Wanted to do something
different.

04:28.268 --> 04:31.793
Something more fulfilling.

04:31.836 --> 04:34.535
- Was she in any
sort of trouble?

04:34.578 --> 04:36.319
Was somebody bothering her?

04:36.363 --> 04:38.234
- No, nothing like that.
She was a g--

04:38.278 --> 04:40.149
she was a good kid.

04:40.192 --> 04:42.847
I mean, she...

04:42.891 --> 04:46.503
she was a great kid.

04:46.547 --> 04:48.113
- Oh, Mike.

04:54.555 --> 04:57.819
I don't want this
to be my life right now.

05:02.389 --> 05:05.435
- No, I'm not aware
of any direct threats,

05:05.479 --> 05:07.481
but Judge Chapman
was very private.

05:07.524 --> 05:08.960
She never talked to me

05:09.004 --> 05:11.223
about personal
or professional issues.

05:11.267 --> 05:12.529
- Did you notice
anything unusual

05:12.573 --> 05:14.009
over the past few weeks?

05:14.052 --> 05:15.489
Packages or letters?

05:15.532 --> 05:18.230
- No, nothing.

05:18.274 --> 05:19.754
- What about her behavior?

05:19.797 --> 05:22.147
Was she acting different
in any way? More stressed?

05:22.191 --> 05:23.671
- No.

05:23.714 --> 05:25.629
- Did you overhear
any arguments?

05:25.673 --> 05:27.152
Any contentious phone calls?

05:28.719 --> 05:32.636
- Yesterday,
she was definitely distracted.

05:32.680 --> 05:35.552
And she was yelling into
her phone, said something like,

05:35.596 --> 05:37.554
"How long
has this been going on?"

05:37.598 --> 05:40.252
Then she left the office
for an hour or so.

05:40.296 --> 05:42.820
- What time was that?
- Around noon.

05:42.864 --> 05:44.648
- Do you know
who she was talking to

05:44.692 --> 05:46.346
or where she went?

05:46.389 --> 05:48.783
- No, I'm sorry.

05:48.826 --> 05:50.219
- If you can think
of anything else,

05:50.262 --> 05:53.396
please call me.

05:53.440 --> 05:55.790
Hey, Kristen, it's me.
Can you find out

05:55.833 --> 05:58.445
who Judge Chapman was talking
to yesterday around noon?

05:58.488 --> 06:01.404
Run her credit cards
and rideshare accounts too.

06:01.448 --> 06:04.451
Same time, around 12:00.

06:10.370 --> 06:12.676
'Scuse me.

06:12.720 --> 06:16.376
I'm Agent Bell.
This is Agent Zidan.

06:16.419 --> 06:18.073
- Hi, how can I help you?

06:18.116 --> 06:20.989
- Have you ever seen
this woman before?

06:24.949 --> 06:26.908
- No, not that I recall anyway.
Why?

06:26.951 --> 06:28.344
- A car dropped her off

06:28.388 --> 06:30.433
at this address yesterday
around noon.

06:30.477 --> 06:33.175
- Well, maybe she got
dropped off here

06:33.218 --> 06:35.090
but went somewhere else?

06:35.133 --> 06:36.787
- What's this about anyway?

06:36.831 --> 06:38.528
- We're investigating
a homicide.

06:38.572 --> 06:40.356
- Double homicide, actually.

06:40.400 --> 06:42.576
What about her?

06:44.491 --> 06:46.057
- Lot of people come
in and out of here.

06:46.101 --> 06:47.755
it's dark, the music's loud.

06:47.798 --> 06:50.235
It's kind of hard
to pick out faces, sorry.

06:50.279 --> 06:52.237
- We'd like to take a look
at your surveillance footage.

06:52.281 --> 06:55.415
- Sorry, we don't have any
internal video cameras here.

06:55.458 --> 06:59.419
Too many celebrities and VIPS.

06:59.462 --> 07:00.942
- Okay.

07:00.985 --> 07:04.075
We're gonna be executing
a search warrant anyway.

07:04.119 --> 07:07.078
- Sure thing.

07:12.562 --> 07:14.869
- Why would Judge Chapman come
here in the middle of the day?

07:14.912 --> 07:16.479
It's not even open at noon.

07:16.523 --> 07:18.133
- Maybe to talk to
one of the employees?

07:18.176 --> 07:19.395
- What, you think she's
having an affair

07:19.439 --> 07:20.831
with one of these guys?

07:20.875 --> 07:22.572
- It's possible.

07:22.616 --> 07:24.444
There's no evidence
of that, though.

07:24.487 --> 07:27.229
No texts or emails.

07:27.272 --> 07:28.535
- Excuse me.

07:28.578 --> 07:31.233
Can I ask you a few questions?

07:31.276 --> 07:33.975
Have you seen either of these
two women before?

07:34.018 --> 07:36.673
- No, sorry.
- You didn't even look.

07:36.717 --> 07:38.066
- You ain't paying me, brah.
I got work to do.

07:38.109 --> 07:39.197
- Hey, I'm asking you
a question--

07:39.241 --> 07:40.808
- Don't touch me!

07:40.851 --> 07:43.375
- Are you out of your mind?
Hands on the bar.

07:43.419 --> 07:45.290
Congratulations, badass,
you're under arrest.

07:45.334 --> 07:46.901
- Lawyer.
- Wow, that was fast.

07:46.944 --> 07:48.903
I'm guessing this isn't
your maiden voyage.

07:48.946 --> 07:50.818
- Hey, hey, guys, relax. She
probably didn't see the badges.

07:50.861 --> 07:52.210
- Hey, sir, step back.

07:52.254 --> 07:53.951
- There's no reason
to jam her up

07:53.995 --> 07:57.215
over a simple misunderstanding.
- I said step back.

08:09.576 --> 08:10.707
- My coat.

08:31.554 --> 08:33.948
- What's up, Maggie?
It's been a minute.

08:33.991 --> 08:35.689
- Yeah, it's been
a long minute.

08:35.732 --> 08:37.212
It's great to see you.

08:37.255 --> 08:39.606
- Yeah, the circumstances
aren't ideal,

08:39.649 --> 08:42.913
but it's great to see you too.

08:42.957 --> 08:44.915
- A little help here.

08:44.959 --> 08:46.743
- Gina's one of us.
FBI.

08:46.787 --> 08:48.223
We're both in the same class
at Quantico,

08:48.266 --> 08:50.094
and we worked undercover too.
- Yeah.

08:50.138 --> 08:52.444
- Broke up a sex trafficking
ring in Jersey.

08:52.488 --> 08:54.534
- Nice to meet you, Gina.
Omar.

08:54.577 --> 08:57.275
- Sorry about the drink.
I had to maintain my cover.

08:57.319 --> 08:59.800
- No worries.

09:08.548 --> 09:10.158
- How long have you been under?

09:10.201 --> 09:12.073
- 14 months.
- With the club?

09:12.116 --> 09:13.509
- Ten.

09:13.553 --> 09:16.077
It took me four just
to get the job,

09:16.120 --> 09:18.340
another five to work my way up
to manager.

09:18.383 --> 09:20.951
- That's impressive.
They must really like you.

09:20.995 --> 09:22.518
- Yeah.
- What are you investigating?

09:22.562 --> 09:23.693
- It's more like who.

09:23.737 --> 09:24.781
- The owners?

09:24.825 --> 09:26.609
- Jack Rossi and Ray Costa.

09:26.653 --> 09:29.481
Two of the biggest cocaine
traffickers in the northeast.

09:29.525 --> 09:31.875
They move about 100 kilos
a month.

09:31.919 --> 09:33.877
Yeah.
Rossi, the good-looking guy,

09:33.921 --> 09:35.618
he oversees the distribution,
washes the money--

09:35.662 --> 09:37.011
he's the brains.

09:37.054 --> 09:39.361
Costa, the other guy,
he's the muscle.

09:39.404 --> 09:41.406
Has a cousin in
the Sinaloa cartel.

09:41.450 --> 09:43.060
- I'd say our
murder investigation

09:43.104 --> 09:44.801
just got more interesting.
- Or more complicated.

09:44.845 --> 09:46.629
- What are you talking about?

09:46.673 --> 09:48.849
- One of our DOAs
was a federal judge.

09:48.892 --> 09:51.286
- And for some reason
that federal judge took time

09:51.329 --> 09:54.115
out of her busy day to go visit
Rossi and Costa yesterday,

09:54.158 --> 09:56.726
five hours before she and her
daughter were gunned down.

09:56.770 --> 09:58.902
I'm guessing that's not
a coincidence.

09:58.946 --> 10:01.644
- Now that your bosses
aren't around...

10:01.688 --> 10:03.733
she come in yesterday?

10:03.777 --> 10:06.606
- No, but if I hear anything...

10:07.868 --> 10:09.478
- Still good to see you.

10:09.521 --> 10:11.349
I know.

10:11.393 --> 10:13.003
- Look, when you're finished
with this case,

10:13.047 --> 10:15.527
let's hang out and catch up.
- Absolutely.

10:15.571 --> 10:17.617
So how do you guys want
to play this arrest?

10:17.660 --> 10:19.662
Assault and battery with
a dangerous soft drink?

10:19.706 --> 10:21.577
- Yeah, you're just lucky it
wasn't one of my fancy shirts.

10:23.144 --> 10:25.320
- Say we brought you in,
showed you some pictures,

10:25.363 --> 10:28.453
asked some questions,
you know,

10:28.497 --> 10:30.847
gave you a stern scolding,
told you to get the hell out.

10:30.891 --> 10:33.850
- See you.

10:33.894 --> 10:36.592
- So according to our
undercover agent, Gina Pratt,

10:36.636 --> 10:39.290
Costa has a cousin in
the Sinaloa Cartel.

10:39.334 --> 10:41.771
Who knows, maybe the hit
was a favor to him?

10:41.815 --> 10:44.426
- I thought about that too.
So I went through every case

10:44.469 --> 10:46.297
Judge Chapman presided
over for the past three years,

10:46.341 --> 10:48.125
including pending cases.
- Yeah.

10:48.169 --> 10:50.127
- There was nothing connecting
her to the Sinaloa Cartel.

10:50.171 --> 10:52.129
- Right, all right, moving on.

10:52.173 --> 10:53.522
What about the shell casings?

10:53.565 --> 10:55.698
- I ran them through NIBIN.
No hits.

10:55.742 --> 10:57.787
Also checked for DNA
and fingerprints.

10:57.831 --> 10:59.397
Negative there also.

10:59.441 --> 11:00.703
- Video?

11:00.747 --> 11:03.445
- Well, we do have this.

11:05.969 --> 11:07.797
Okay, you see right there?

11:07.841 --> 11:10.104
It looks he could be concealing
a weapon in his jacket.

11:10.147 --> 11:12.410
- Can we get a better look
at his face?

11:12.454 --> 11:14.499
- I tried, but he stares down
the whole time.

11:14.543 --> 11:16.545
I'll send it to Quantico, see
if they can work some magic,

11:16.588 --> 11:18.416
but it is doubtful.
- Okay.

11:18.460 --> 11:20.462
- Hey, we've been running
the daughter's phone.

11:20.505 --> 11:22.856
Nothing too interesting,
but we did find lots

11:22.899 --> 11:25.554
of cryptic texts sent through
an anonymous messaging app.

11:25.597 --> 11:28.122
- What do you mean "cryptic"?

11:28.165 --> 11:31.081
- "I'm not sure what to do.
Need time to process.

11:31.125 --> 11:33.649
Don't worry.
I won't tell the police."

11:33.693 --> 11:35.129
And check out this one.

11:35.172 --> 11:37.087
"Sorry, know I'm not
supposed to text.

11:37.131 --> 11:40.090
Just don't feel like talking."

11:40.134 --> 11:42.005
- Did she call this person
by name?

11:42.049 --> 11:43.964
- No.
- Did you run the other phone?

11:44.007 --> 11:45.313
- Yeah, it's a burner.

11:45.356 --> 11:46.836
- A burner? That's odd.

11:46.880 --> 11:48.185
People like Sam don't
usually run

11:48.229 --> 11:49.665
with the burner-phone crowd.

11:49.709 --> 11:51.580
- Guys, got some good news.

11:51.623 --> 11:54.061
The lab found trace DNA
on Sam's body.

11:54.104 --> 11:58.239
Got a hit too.
- Yes.

11:58.282 --> 12:00.981
- It's not a good idea to lie
to the FBI, Jack.

12:01.024 --> 12:03.853
- So bad, it's a felony.

12:03.897 --> 12:06.334
- What are you talking about?

12:06.377 --> 12:10.338
- We found your DNA
on Sam's body.

12:10.381 --> 12:12.383
- Okay, that actually
makes sense.

12:12.427 --> 12:13.820
We had sex the night
before she...

12:13.863 --> 12:15.212
- Before she was murdered?

12:15.256 --> 12:17.737
Is that what you were
gonna say?

12:17.780 --> 12:19.390
- Yes.

12:19.434 --> 12:20.652
- So let me get this straight.

12:20.696 --> 12:22.480
You had sex with Sam Chapman,

12:22.524 --> 12:24.395
but you couldn't identify
her in a photo?

12:24.439 --> 12:26.136
- Which we showed to you
the day after

12:26.180 --> 12:27.572
this alleged sexual
interaction.

12:27.616 --> 12:29.313
- I apologize.
My eyes aren't great.

12:29.357 --> 12:30.575
I should have put
my glasses on.

12:30.619 --> 12:31.925
I'm farsighted.

12:31.968 --> 12:33.448
- That's not a good answer,
Jack.

12:33.491 --> 12:35.319
- That's an awful answer
considering she's dead.

12:35.363 --> 12:37.452
- And her mother is
a federal judge,

12:37.495 --> 12:40.324
so we are looking at the
death penalty here, my friend.

12:43.545 --> 12:46.200
- Where were you yesterday
afternoon around 5:00 p.m.?

12:46.243 --> 12:48.245
- At the club, working.

12:48.289 --> 12:50.160
You can ask my staff.
There were five bartenders,

12:50.204 --> 12:52.815
ten waitresses there,
but that's all I'm gonna say.

12:52.859 --> 12:56.036
If you want to talk some more,
please call my lawyer.

12:59.430 --> 13:02.651
- You're free to go.

13:09.658 --> 13:11.268
Talk to Jubal.

13:11.312 --> 13:14.228
I want two agents tailing
him 24/7.

13:16.883 --> 13:19.842
- So Costa was telling
the truth.

13:19.886 --> 13:21.844
Club only has surveillance
cameras outside.

13:21.888 --> 13:23.411
Nothing inside.
- Mm.

13:23.454 --> 13:24.716
They don't want to record
their own crimes.

13:24.760 --> 13:26.414
Go figure.

13:26.457 --> 13:31.985
- Okay, there's Judge Chapman.

13:32.028 --> 13:35.771
Time stamp 12:07.
- Yeah.

13:35.815 --> 13:39.427
- Nine minutes later, 12:16,
She exits the club.

13:39.470 --> 13:41.646
- Huh.
- So the question is,

13:41.690 --> 13:44.867
who did she talk to?
What did they talk about?

13:44.911 --> 13:47.174
- And did that conversation
motivate the murders?

13:47.217 --> 13:49.045
- You know what? Keep the
recording going for a second.

13:49.089 --> 13:51.743
- Sure.

13:51.787 --> 13:53.354
- Yeah, you see this guy?

13:53.397 --> 13:54.659
He was in the car
the whole time.

13:54.703 --> 13:56.487
He saw the judge exit.
- Yeah.

13:56.531 --> 14:00.230
- Why don't you--
yeah, there you go.

14:00.274 --> 14:02.058
- Nice. All right, run it.
We'll go check it out.

14:02.102 --> 14:04.104
- Yeah.

14:08.021 --> 14:10.284
- Nah, didn't see her.

14:10.327 --> 14:12.329
Didn't hear her say
nothing either.

14:12.373 --> 14:14.984
Why?
What's this about?

14:15.028 --> 14:18.031
- We're investigating a murder.

14:23.732 --> 14:26.909
- That's you getting out
of the car, correct?

14:26.953 --> 14:30.347
And that's you turning around
and looking at her?

14:30.391 --> 14:33.133
- Yeah, but,

14:33.176 --> 14:35.613
man, look, it's just a habit.

14:35.657 --> 14:37.311
You know, when I see something
that's lean and mean,

14:37.354 --> 14:40.270
I can't help it.
It's--it's like an instinct.

14:40.314 --> 14:41.924
- Mm.

14:41.968 --> 14:44.057
So you're checking her out.
That's what you're saying?

14:46.233 --> 14:48.713
What were you doing
at the club that day?

14:48.757 --> 14:51.716
- I work there.
I'm the doorman.

14:55.764 --> 14:58.114
- Have you seen this
woman before?

15:00.247 --> 15:02.162
- Yeah, she was there
a few nights ago.

15:02.205 --> 15:03.511
I talked to her.

15:03.554 --> 15:04.816
- What do you mean you talked
to her?

15:04.860 --> 15:07.210
- She was yelling and crying.

15:07.254 --> 15:10.039
Her shirt was ripped too.
I didn't know what happened.

15:10.083 --> 15:11.911
I asked her
if she needed some help,

15:11.954 --> 15:14.522
if she wanted me
to call the cops, but...

15:14.565 --> 15:16.916
she just ran out.

15:20.354 --> 15:22.138
- So Sam was at the club
the night before the murder?

15:22.182 --> 15:24.532
- Yeah, we ran some video.
She left around 2:00 a.m.

15:24.575 --> 15:27.752
- Doorman said she was crying,
yelling, clothes were torn.

15:27.796 --> 15:29.624
- Like she was in a fight?

15:29.667 --> 15:33.758
- We're thinking more like
sexually assaulted.

15:33.802 --> 15:35.282
- What?

15:35.325 --> 15:37.806
- The lab found Rossi's DNA
on Sam's body.

15:37.849 --> 15:39.373
He said they did have sex,

15:39.416 --> 15:41.375
but based on this,

15:41.418 --> 15:43.246
it sounds like it might not
have been consensual.

15:43.290 --> 15:45.205
- Well, that would explain why
Judge Chapman was so upset

15:45.248 --> 15:46.728
and went to the club
the next day.

15:46.771 --> 15:48.251
Is Rossi's alibi clean?

15:48.295 --> 15:50.514
- It's more than clean.
It's airtight.

15:50.558 --> 15:53.648
He was at the club
the time of the murder.

15:53.691 --> 15:55.998
- Okay, I have 50 agents on the
street looking for witnesses,

15:56.042 --> 15:57.739
surveillance video,
and forensics,

15:57.782 --> 16:00.481
but right, now our best lead
is Rossi and this nightclub,

16:00.524 --> 16:03.179
so I want the two of you
to focus on that.

16:03.223 --> 16:05.747
- Focus on what?
- The drug case.

16:05.790 --> 16:10.882
You tell your friend Gina
that her case is now our case.

16:10.926 --> 16:12.623
- Okay.

16:16.758 --> 16:19.587
- Wait, you want to work
together on this case?

16:19.630 --> 16:22.024
- Rossi's out best lead.
- I get that, but--

16:22.068 --> 16:23.983
- Murder of a federal judge.
Enough said.

16:24.026 --> 16:27.812
Trumps a drug investigation
all day, every day.

16:27.856 --> 16:30.990
- I understand that, but I have
been working this myself.

16:31.033 --> 16:33.993
- Our SAC already called
your supervisor.

16:34.036 --> 16:36.343
It's done.

16:36.386 --> 16:39.172
- Oh, well, you probably should
have led with that.

16:39.215 --> 16:41.000
- Sorry.

16:41.043 --> 16:42.958
The plan is to accelerate
the drug investigation,

16:43.002 --> 16:45.787
catch Rossi dirty,
and hopefully flip him

16:45.830 --> 16:48.485
so that he cooperates with
the murder case.

16:48.529 --> 16:50.357
- Well,
your timing's perfect.

16:50.400 --> 16:51.662
Rossi called me an hour ago,

16:51.706 --> 16:53.316
asked me to grab
a cute girlfriend

16:53.360 --> 16:55.840
and head out to Brooklyn
tonight with him and Costa.

16:55.884 --> 16:58.278
- Smart. They want a cover.

16:58.321 --> 17:00.410
Make it look like a double date
in case they get pulled over.

17:00.454 --> 17:02.673
- Or so they don't
get pulled over.

17:02.717 --> 17:04.501
Local cops are 35% less likely

17:04.545 --> 17:06.590
to pull over a female driver
for a traffic violation.

17:06.634 --> 17:10.638
- And it's totally sexist,
I know, but in a good way.

17:10.681 --> 17:12.988
For us anyway.

17:13.032 --> 17:14.990
- I'll be in touch with
the details.

17:15.034 --> 17:17.297
Oh, and I'm gonna need a cute
friend to go with me.

17:17.340 --> 17:19.821
- I got you.

17:23.868 --> 17:25.435
- Hey, girl.

17:25.479 --> 17:29.091
- What's up, girl?
- How are you?

17:29.135 --> 17:31.441
Hey.
Yo, this is Sasha.

17:31.485 --> 17:33.313
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.

17:33.356 --> 17:35.619
- Nice to meet you.
- And you.

17:35.663 --> 17:37.143
- Where you from, Sasha?

17:37.186 --> 17:40.755
- Queens, two blocks from Gina.

17:40.798 --> 17:42.713
- You'll like her, Ray.
She's cool.

17:42.757 --> 17:44.933
- I wasn't talking to you,
Gina.

17:44.976 --> 17:46.500
- Man, why do you gotta be
so rude?

17:46.543 --> 17:48.980
She's just making conversation.

17:51.418 --> 17:55.465
- I'm sorry, Gina.

17:55.509 --> 17:57.380
Sasha,
why don't you sit up front?

17:57.424 --> 17:59.643
- Sure.

18:02.646 --> 18:04.953
- I got it.
- Thank you.

18:04.996 --> 18:07.129
Such a gentleman.

18:13.222 --> 18:15.616
- Got into a silver
late-model SUV.

18:15.659 --> 18:19.098
New York plates, Papa, Kilo,
8, 1, 1, Juliet, 3.

18:19.141 --> 18:21.143
- Copy that.
We're at the location.

18:21.187 --> 18:22.797
- Is the product in the car?

18:22.840 --> 18:25.669
- Gina couldn't confirm.
So it might be a cash pickup.

18:25.713 --> 18:28.977
Delivery will be at a later
time at a different location.

18:29.020 --> 18:31.022
We're just gonna have
to stay loose,

18:31.066 --> 18:33.764
see how this plays out.

18:33.808 --> 18:36.027
- Okay.

18:39.205 --> 18:41.468
- That them?

18:41.511 --> 18:43.600
- Black Escalade,
New York plates,

18:43.644 --> 18:47.561
2, 2, 6, 6, Charlie, Mike.

18:50.738 --> 18:52.435
- Where we going?

18:52.479 --> 18:54.655
I thought we were headed
into the city.

18:54.698 --> 18:57.484
- We are. Ray and I just gotta
run a quick errand first.

18:57.527 --> 18:58.920
It won't take long.

18:58.963 --> 19:01.270
- But we are going out later,
right?

19:01.314 --> 19:04.360
I promised Sasha
a fun night out.

19:04.404 --> 19:07.972
I mean, look at her.
She all dressed up,

19:08.016 --> 19:09.278
looking fine!

19:10.888 --> 19:13.674
- You're looking pretty
fine yourself.

19:13.717 --> 19:16.546
- Thank you.

19:16.590 --> 19:18.940
- Okay, slow down.
Let's do a U-turn right here

19:18.983 --> 19:22.204
and pull up behind
that Escalade.

19:28.645 --> 19:30.952
- Target is landed
at the location.

19:30.995 --> 19:34.390
Hold tight.
We'll go on my order.

19:34.434 --> 19:36.175
- We're gonna hop out
and talk to our friends.

19:36.218 --> 19:38.089
We'll be right back.
- Okay.

19:54.802 --> 19:57.283
- Hey, hey.

20:00.155 --> 20:01.939
I don't want to sound paranoid
or anything,

20:01.983 --> 20:03.854
but you see that car
over there?

20:03.898 --> 20:07.162
Across the street
in the alley.

20:07.206 --> 20:08.946
I could've sworn
I saw somebody inside.

20:08.990 --> 20:10.557
It could be cops.

20:10.600 --> 20:12.472
- What the hell is she doing?
- I don't know.

20:24.310 --> 20:26.094
- What the hell was that?

20:26.137 --> 20:28.227
Why did Gina blow the deal?

20:40.195 --> 20:42.719
- Gina, what the hell?

20:42.763 --> 20:45.592
- I saw Costa eyeing your car.
He was getting nervous.

20:45.635 --> 20:47.115
He was about to call
the whole thing off,

20:47.158 --> 20:48.812
so I beat him to the punch

20:48.856 --> 20:52.120
and bought some undercover cred
in the process.

20:52.163 --> 20:54.165
- You're saying
that Costa made us?

20:54.209 --> 20:55.776
- I'm saying he was about
to make you,

20:55.819 --> 20:57.865
so I got in front of it.

20:57.908 --> 20:59.432
Besides, the coke wasn't
in the car.

20:59.475 --> 21:00.781
It was gonna be
a third-party drop.

21:00.824 --> 21:02.870
It would have been
a tough bust.

21:02.913 --> 21:04.611
- Is that what you saw?

21:04.654 --> 21:06.003
- I was in the front seat.

21:06.047 --> 21:07.440
I didn't see where
he was looking.

21:07.483 --> 21:09.355
- You questioning my story?

21:09.398 --> 21:10.573
- I'm just trying
to figure out why

21:10.617 --> 21:12.053
someone would blow up a deal

21:12.096 --> 21:13.968
they've been waiting
to close for 14 months.

21:14.011 --> 21:15.404
Not to mention
the way you did it.

21:15.448 --> 21:17.363
That could have gone bad
a thousand ways.

21:17.406 --> 21:21.410
- But it didn't.

21:21.454 --> 21:23.586
- Okay, let's just move on,
all right?

21:23.630 --> 21:25.893
Nobody got hurt
and nobody got made.

21:27.286 --> 21:29.897
The good news is that your
cover is better than ever now.

21:29.940 --> 21:31.899
- Mm-hmm.
- So let's run with that.

21:31.942 --> 21:35.076
All right? We'll introduce
a new buyer, make a bust,

21:35.119 --> 21:38.035
and hopefully get Rossi
to flip on the murders.

21:38.079 --> 21:39.776
- That's risky.
- I know.

21:39.820 --> 21:41.430
- I thought you were tight
with Rossi.

21:41.474 --> 21:44.390
- Well, I am because
I don't push too hard.

21:44.433 --> 21:47.306
- Well, maybe it's time
to switch up your strategy.

21:47.349 --> 21:50.309
You've been working this case
a pretty long time.

21:50.352 --> 21:52.876
- Who the hell do you think
you're talking to?

21:52.920 --> 21:55.618
Some punk-ass rookie
fresh out of Quantico?

21:57.707 --> 21:59.666
- I just want some answers.

21:59.709 --> 22:01.929
- Okay, well, here they are.

22:01.972 --> 22:04.235
One, it took me
damn near a year

22:04.279 --> 22:06.020
to get this kind of access
to these guys.

22:06.063 --> 22:07.674
It's not like I just walked in

22:07.717 --> 22:09.806
and they started
confiding in me.

22:09.850 --> 22:13.157
Two, before this federal judge
and her daughter got killed--

22:13.201 --> 22:16.335
when my drug case turned into
a murder case--

22:16.378 --> 22:18.467
the assignment was
to stay under until

22:18.511 --> 22:21.862
I could identify
the cartel connect.

22:21.905 --> 22:24.691
Which is why there's been
no arrest.

22:27.084 --> 22:29.391
Now how's that, big man?

22:29.435 --> 22:31.350
Good enough?

22:36.703 --> 22:38.487
I'll introduce Rossi
to your people,

22:38.531 --> 22:40.054
and then we'll go from there.
- Okay.

22:40.097 --> 22:41.621
- And before you make
an accusation,

22:41.664 --> 22:44.014
make sure that you have
the facts to back it up.

22:57.419 --> 22:59.682
- Still not buying her story.
We were on the wire.

22:59.726 --> 23:01.728
We didn't hear Costa say a word
about seeing a cop.

23:01.771 --> 23:03.469
- Yeah, I don't know.
I mean,

23:03.512 --> 23:05.340
there's a chance they could
have whispered something to her

23:05.384 --> 23:06.776
on the way out the door, but--

23:06.820 --> 23:08.648
- Guys, she said
that Costa saw something,

23:08.691 --> 23:10.171
not that he said something.

23:10.214 --> 23:11.607
- Come on, Maggie.
You really think

23:11.651 --> 23:13.609
he saw our cover car across
the street

23:13.653 --> 23:15.002
and made us out for cops?

23:15.045 --> 23:17.047
- It's absolutely possible.

23:17.091 --> 23:18.440
I know where you're going
with this,

23:18.484 --> 23:20.964
but you don't know Gina
the way that I do.

23:21.008 --> 23:22.705
If she said it was
the right move,

23:22.749 --> 23:26.230
it was the right move.

23:26.274 --> 23:29.930
- Okay, let's figure out who's
gonna make this buy.

23:35.457 --> 23:36.980
- This is the guy I was telling
you about.

23:37.024 --> 23:39.156
His name's Jay.
- Hey.

23:39.200 --> 23:40.549
- Nice to meet you, Jay.
- Yeah, you too.

23:40.593 --> 23:43.160
- He's a good dude.
Lives in Connecticut

23:43.204 --> 23:45.511
and sells to rich white folks
in Fairfield County.

23:45.554 --> 23:47.687
-  That is true.

23:51.821 --> 23:53.519
- Gina said you wanted 5 keys.

23:53.562 --> 23:55.564
- Yeah, yeah,
and if things go well,

23:55.608 --> 23:57.218
we can add more weight later.

23:57.261 --> 23:58.915
But that's what
I'm looking for right now.

23:58.959 --> 24:01.875
- Mind if I see your ID?

24:01.918 --> 24:04.486
- Yeah, sure.

24:04.530 --> 24:05.879
Just for the record,

24:05.922 --> 24:07.881
I look much younger
than my actual age,

24:07.924 --> 24:10.405
so don't hate a brother for
having good genes, all right?

24:10.449 --> 24:11.928
- How long you known Gina?

24:11.972 --> 24:13.887
- About, I guess, five years.

24:13.930 --> 24:16.367
I used to date
a friend of hers. Thanks.

24:16.411 --> 24:17.630
- Oh, that's right.
She told me.

24:17.673 --> 24:20.981
Uh, Victoria, right?

24:21.024 --> 24:25.159
- No, her name's Kim Grace.

24:25.202 --> 24:26.943
All good, man.

24:37.388 --> 24:39.695
What--who's this?

24:39.739 --> 24:42.219
- This is our polygraph expert.

24:42.263 --> 24:43.743
- He's just gonna ask you
a couple of questions.

24:43.786 --> 24:45.527
No big deal.

24:45.571 --> 24:47.398
Unless, of course,
you want to bail.

24:53.187 --> 24:56.190
Uh, no, no, I'm good.

24:56.233 --> 24:57.626
- You sure?

24:57.670 --> 25:01.238
'Cause now's the time to leave.

25:01.282 --> 25:04.154
No harm, no foul.

25:11.422 --> 25:13.033
- Bring it.

25:13.076 --> 25:15.557
- "Bring it"?
Who does he think he is?

25:15.601 --> 25:17.167
- Apparently a badass FBI agent

25:17.211 --> 25:18.821
who thinks he can beat
the polygraph.

25:18.865 --> 25:21.128
- Yeah, I'm not so sure.

25:21.171 --> 25:22.825
- No problem.
- Well, we can't pull him.

25:22.869 --> 25:25.741
We're gonna blow our cover
and blow Gina's cover.

25:25.785 --> 25:28.048
- Okay, we let it play out
for now.

25:31.791 --> 25:36.404
- Is your name Jay Valentine?
- Yes.

25:36.447 --> 25:39.581
- Did you ever date a woman
named Kim Grace?

25:39.625 --> 25:40.974
- Yes.

25:44.020 --> 25:50.244
- Have you ever worked
for the NYPD, DEA, or FBI?

25:50.287 --> 25:52.376
- No.

26:02.865 --> 26:05.172
- Still no distress signal.

26:05.215 --> 26:07.130
- No, he's all in.

26:07.174 --> 26:10.177
Just hope he knows what
the hell he's doing.

26:12.658 --> 26:14.181
- Okay.

26:26.454 --> 26:29.022
- You're free to go.

26:31.067 --> 26:33.722
- Right.

26:33.766 --> 26:35.768
All right.

26:39.989 --> 26:42.992
- We'll be in touch.

26:48.737 --> 26:50.957
- It's all about meditation,
guys.

26:51.000 --> 26:53.002
Controlling your heartbeat.

26:53.046 --> 26:55.222
Be honest, you didn't think I
could pull it off, did you?

26:57.398 --> 26:59.313
I'm not telling him.

27:06.363 --> 27:08.191
- I talked to Jack.
He liked Jubal.

27:08.235 --> 27:10.454
Deal's moving forward.
- That's great.

27:10.498 --> 27:11.934
- When's it going down?

27:11.978 --> 27:13.719
- I'm not sure,
but I'll talk to Jack later.

27:13.762 --> 27:16.852
I'll let you know what he says.

27:18.985 --> 27:20.900
- What, what is it?

27:20.943 --> 27:22.815
- She called him Jack twice.

27:22.858 --> 27:24.512
In my experience,
when the undercover

27:24.555 --> 27:26.645
starts referring to the target
by his first name,

27:26.688 --> 27:28.734
it's a problem.

27:33.129 --> 27:34.957
- Gina's one of the best
undercover agents

27:35.001 --> 27:36.219
I've ever worked with.

27:36.263 --> 27:37.699
Smart, resourceful, tough.

27:37.743 --> 27:41.224
- Yeah, no, I know.
We worked together.

27:41.268 --> 27:43.487
I was just wondering
if there's anything else

27:43.531 --> 27:45.185
I should know about her

27:45.228 --> 27:46.360
or the operation.

27:46.403 --> 27:47.666
- What do you mean?

27:47.709 --> 27:50.581
- Between me and you,
off the record,

27:50.625 --> 27:53.715
I just want to make sure
that she's solid.

27:53.759 --> 27:55.499
Look, Gina's a friend of mine.

27:55.543 --> 27:57.501
I have a lot of respect
for her.

27:57.545 --> 28:00.069
I'm concerned.

28:00.113 --> 28:02.289
- First, you take over
our drug case,

28:02.332 --> 28:04.944
then you question my ability
to handle my undercover agents?

28:04.987 --> 28:06.685
- No, that's not what I mean--

28:06.728 --> 28:09.078
- Given the number of cases
and agents I oversee,

28:09.122 --> 28:10.732
it's not easy to meet
face-to-face

28:10.776 --> 28:12.995
on a regular basis, so we get
together once a week

28:13.039 --> 28:14.649
at a diner in Connecticut.

28:14.693 --> 28:16.216
- She seems okay?

28:16.259 --> 28:17.913
- I've seen no evidence
that would suggest

28:17.957 --> 28:20.829
she's under any unusual duress.

28:20.873 --> 28:24.441
- Okay.
That's great.

28:24.485 --> 28:26.487
Thank you.

28:29.490 --> 28:30.883
- What'd Franklin say?

28:30.926 --> 28:33.494
- Gina's the best undercover
he's worked with.

28:33.537 --> 28:34.930
- Well, she might be amazing,

28:34.974 --> 28:38.586
but I'm not so sure about
her methods.

28:38.629 --> 28:40.414
- What are you talking about?

28:40.457 --> 28:42.155
- Well, I've been digging
around through footage

28:42.198 --> 28:47.464
near the club, the crime scene,
Rossi's apartment...

28:47.508 --> 28:49.858
and I found this.

29:18.147 --> 29:20.759
- Listen, I want to talk
to her alone.

29:20.802 --> 29:22.195
- Maggie.

29:22.238 --> 29:24.110
- I've known Gina
a really long time.

29:24.153 --> 29:25.894
I at least owe her that.

29:25.938 --> 29:27.504
- Yeah, I get that,
but that's exactly why

29:27.548 --> 29:28.810
you shouldn't
talk to her alone.

29:28.854 --> 29:30.812
You're too close to this.

29:34.033 --> 29:36.557
- You're right.

29:36.600 --> 29:39.386
All I'm asking for is
a little bit of rope here.

29:39.429 --> 29:41.867
That's all.

29:41.910 --> 29:44.695
- Yeah, yeah.
Okay.

29:49.875 --> 29:52.703
- Look, I know this looks bad,
but it's not even like that.

29:52.747 --> 29:57.143
- Gina.
- It was just one stupid kiss.

29:57.186 --> 30:03.018
We--just--it just happened.

30:03.062 --> 30:07.588
- Come on, Gina.
I need more than that.

30:07.631 --> 30:10.373
- Rossi and I grew up
the same way.

30:10.417 --> 30:12.811
We were both raised by
a single mother,

30:12.854 --> 30:14.595
and that night,

30:14.638 --> 30:16.858
we were talking about
what it was like

30:16.902 --> 30:19.382
to grow up without
a strong male role model,

30:19.426 --> 30:24.518
and I got emotional.
So did he.

30:24.561 --> 30:27.738
And so I took advantage of it.

30:27.782 --> 30:30.480
And I used that moment
to ingratiate myself

30:30.524 --> 30:33.179
to the target.

30:33.222 --> 30:36.008
Just like they tell us
to do in Quantico.

30:36.051 --> 30:38.837
- I feel like the lines are
getting blurry here.

30:38.880 --> 30:41.491
- Yeah, well,
that's part of the game.

30:41.535 --> 30:42.884
When you're hanging out
in those streets

30:42.928 --> 30:44.886
with a dude who'll put
a bullet in your head

30:44.930 --> 30:47.802
if they found out who you
really were,

30:47.846 --> 30:49.891
you say what you have to say
and you do what you have to do.

30:49.935 --> 30:52.676
- I--I know. I know that.
Um...

30:57.116 --> 30:59.335
I think you should step away.
- No, no--

30:59.379 --> 31:00.902
- Gina--
- I'm fine. I swear.

31:00.946 --> 31:02.512
- Gina, there's a way
that we can do this

31:02.556 --> 31:03.687
that isn't gonna ruin
your career.

31:03.731 --> 31:04.950
- You pull me now,

31:04.993 --> 31:06.603
and my reputation
will go to hell.

31:06.647 --> 31:09.911
You know this as much as I do.

31:09.955 --> 31:11.478
Maggie, please.
- Look, no, I just--

31:11.521 --> 31:14.873
I don't want you to get hurt.
- Please.

31:14.916 --> 31:17.919
Okay, I'm asking you as
my friend.

31:17.963 --> 31:21.009
Just let it go.

31:21.053 --> 31:23.316
I'll be fine.

31:37.983 --> 31:40.246
- How'd it go?

31:40.289 --> 31:42.378
What does that mean?

31:42.422 --> 31:45.860
- She kissed somebody
she shouldn't have kissed.

31:45.904 --> 31:49.951
I still think she's solid
enough to work the case.

31:49.995 --> 31:51.822
She's been under a long time,
Omar.

31:51.866 --> 31:53.520
This stuff happens.

31:53.563 --> 31:56.131
- Yeah, I get that.
I've been there,

31:56.175 --> 31:57.785
but that doesn't mean
that we should just--

31:57.828 --> 32:00.483
- Okay,
what is the alternative then?

32:00.527 --> 32:04.357
Blow up her career?
Her life?

32:04.400 --> 32:06.576
You know, let the punks
who killed Judge Chapman

32:06.620 --> 32:09.623
and her daughter walk free?

32:09.666 --> 32:11.451
- I'll follow your lead,

32:11.494 --> 32:14.323
but the next hiccup,
we should pull her.

32:14.367 --> 32:18.023
- Well, next hiccup, I'll be
the first one to do that.

32:18.066 --> 32:21.069
- Okay, what's our next move?

32:32.602 --> 32:34.865
They're an hour late.

32:34.909 --> 32:37.694
- That's on time, even
early for most drug dealers.

32:37.738 --> 32:39.087
-  Not these guys.

32:39.131 --> 32:41.698
They've been pretty punctual
so far.

32:50.403 --> 32:52.622
A few years back,
I was under at a mosque.

32:52.666 --> 32:54.189
And one night,
I was having dinner

32:54.233 --> 32:56.583
with our main target, Kareem

32:56.626 --> 33:00.804
at this Vietnamese restaurant
in Queens.

33:00.848 --> 33:04.417
And halfway through,
he just starts crying.

33:04.460 --> 33:07.115
Telling me his wife doesn't
love him,

33:07.159 --> 33:09.726
she's having an affair
with his cousin,

33:09.770 --> 33:11.293
and before you know it,

33:11.337 --> 33:13.992
we are pouring our hearts out
to each other.

33:17.299 --> 33:19.562
But it was real.

33:19.606 --> 33:23.566
For that one night, me
and Kareem were best friends.

33:23.610 --> 33:25.046
It didn't matter
that I was a cop

33:25.090 --> 33:28.615
or that he was a criminal.

33:28.658 --> 33:30.965
- Yeah.

33:31.009 --> 33:35.404
This job can get really
complicated.

33:35.448 --> 33:37.450
- Any word from Gina?

33:37.493 --> 33:39.539
- She sent a text
15 minutes ago.

33:39.582 --> 33:43.151
Said she's running late,
but she's on her way here.

33:43.195 --> 33:46.024
And she lied.
- What do you mean?

33:46.067 --> 33:47.460
- They're on their way
to Jersey.

33:47.503 --> 33:49.070
- What?

33:49.114 --> 33:50.637
- I activated the GPS tracker
in her cell phone

33:50.680 --> 33:54.075
a couple days ago.

33:54.119 --> 33:55.903
Hey, Jubal,
the drug deal's off

33:55.946 --> 33:57.948
and Agent Gina Pratt
is on the run.

33:57.992 --> 34:00.386
- All right.
I'm heading back in.

34:13.225 --> 34:15.444
- All units,
establish a blockade

34:15.488 --> 34:17.968
at the intersection
of Route 46 and Huyler.

34:18.012 --> 34:21.015
Suspect's vehicle is heading
west in that direction.

34:23.583 --> 34:25.063
- That's Gina's car!

34:25.106 --> 34:26.629
- We have eyes on
the suspect's vehicle.

34:26.673 --> 34:29.154
Heading eastbound
from Route 46.

34:29.197 --> 34:30.938
No cars to cover.

34:30.981 --> 34:32.766
- Be advised,
blockade is in place

34:32.809 --> 34:35.160
with additional units
standing by.

34:44.256 --> 34:46.562
- ...is on scene.
Suspect is inbound...

34:53.134 --> 34:54.396
- Let's go!

35:08.454 --> 35:11.370
- Gina, get out of the car.

35:11.413 --> 35:14.068
- Show us your hands.
Get 'em up!

35:18.246 --> 35:22.772
- Gina, step out of the car.

35:32.347 --> 35:33.870
Show me your hands.

35:33.914 --> 35:36.177
- Or what?

35:36.221 --> 35:38.266
- "Or what"?

35:38.310 --> 35:39.659
Look around.

35:39.702 --> 35:41.313
This isn't gonna
work out well for you.

35:51.236 --> 35:53.238
Gina, please.

35:56.110 --> 35:58.112
Put your hands up.

36:06.468 --> 36:09.210
- I was just taking a drive.
I needed to clear my head.

36:09.254 --> 36:11.386
- No, don't do that.
- Don't do what?

36:11.430 --> 36:14.346
- Lie to me again.

36:16.217 --> 36:19.177
What have you done?

36:25.052 --> 36:27.228
- I can't betray him.

36:27.272 --> 36:29.839
- Betray him?

36:29.883 --> 36:32.102
What about the Bureau?

36:32.146 --> 36:35.105
What about me?

36:35.149 --> 36:38.152
- He's a good person, Maggie.

36:38.196 --> 36:41.286
Like, he sells drugs.
I get it.

36:43.288 --> 36:46.334
But he's a really good person.

36:46.378 --> 36:51.209
And we understand each other.
We respect each other.

36:51.252 --> 36:52.645
We've gotten really close,

36:52.688 --> 36:55.735
and he sees something
in me that no person...

36:58.694 --> 37:02.089
Has ever seen!

37:02.132 --> 37:04.265
- Gina.

37:04.309 --> 37:07.877
I understand how muddled
and confusing it gets

37:07.921 --> 37:10.010
when you're under,
but this relationship with him

37:10.053 --> 37:14.232
is not real.

37:14.275 --> 37:16.843
Okay?
He's not connecting to you.

37:16.886 --> 37:20.803
He's connecting to the person
who you're pretending to be.

37:25.417 --> 37:27.549
Come on.
You gotta come clean now

37:27.593 --> 37:29.899
while I can still help you.

37:29.943 --> 37:33.860
Please, tell me where they are.

37:33.903 --> 37:36.297
Where are you meeting?

37:36.341 --> 37:38.256
You gotta tell me now.
I give you my word,

37:38.299 --> 37:39.822
if you tell me now,

37:39.866 --> 37:43.304
I will do everything I can
to protect you.

37:47.961 --> 37:49.354
Come on.

37:49.397 --> 37:52.705
You're running out of time,
Gina.

37:57.536 --> 37:59.799
- We're meeting at the

37:59.842 --> 38:04.717
Essex County Airport...

38:04.760 --> 38:08.242
and then we're going to Mexico.

38:08.286 --> 38:11.376
- Jubal, suspects are headed
to Essex County Airport.

38:11.419 --> 38:13.639
- We've got four vehicles
in pursuit heading north.

38:13.682 --> 38:14.944
- Looks like our suspects
are approximately

38:14.988 --> 38:16.468
two miles from the airport.

38:16.511 --> 38:18.165
- From your location, OA,
your best play

38:18.208 --> 38:20.776
is to head west,
then south on Route 613.

38:20.820 --> 38:23.344
Cut 'em off before
they hit the entrance.

38:33.528 --> 38:35.051
- Man, yo, cops!

38:38.098 --> 38:39.055
Let's go!

38:50.240 --> 38:53.679
- Keep with 'em!

38:53.722 --> 38:55.811
- This way! Come on!
- On the move!

38:55.855 --> 38:58.031
- On the move now!

38:58.074 --> 39:01.077
- Hey, yo!
Go, go!

39:05.168 --> 39:06.779
- Get down on your knees!

39:06.822 --> 39:08.781
Now!

39:23.709 --> 39:25.275
- Hey.
- Hey.

39:25.319 --> 39:27.277
- How'd it go with
Mike Chapman?

39:27.321 --> 39:29.454
- Well, he's obviously glad
we arrested the killer,

39:29.497 --> 39:31.586
but he's struggling
to make sense

39:31.630 --> 39:33.936
of how his daughter fell
in love with a drug dealer.

39:33.980 --> 39:35.721
- Yeah, or how a drug dealer
falls in love

39:35.764 --> 39:37.113
with a judge's daughter.

39:37.157 --> 39:39.072
- If there's a silver lining,
I suppose

39:39.115 --> 39:41.030
it's how it all went down.

39:41.074 --> 39:43.859
Judge Chapman finding out about
the relationship, the drugs,

39:43.903 --> 39:47.210
telling Rossi to stay away
from her daughter.

39:47.254 --> 39:49.822
Mike told me that...

39:49.865 --> 39:51.780
knowing this his wife died
protecting their daughter

39:51.824 --> 39:53.956
gives him something
to hold onto.

39:54.000 --> 39:55.523
At least that's something.

39:55.567 --> 40:00.093
- Yeah.

40:00.136 --> 40:02.095
Have you spoken with
the U.S. Attorney's Office

40:02.138 --> 40:04.227
about Gina?
- Yes.

40:04.271 --> 40:06.142
- And you told them everything?

40:06.186 --> 40:09.624
About how she's been
under 14 months

40:09.668 --> 40:11.713
and is suffering from
Stockholm?

40:11.757 --> 40:15.325
- I told them everything,
Maggie.

40:15.369 --> 40:17.589
- Good. Thank you.

40:20.940 --> 40:22.811
Have they made a decision?

40:39.480 --> 40:43.441
- Hey.
- Hey.

40:43.484 --> 40:44.964
As expected,

40:45.007 --> 40:49.011
Rossi caved,
gave us everything.

40:49.055 --> 40:51.927
Told us that Costa killed
Sam and her mother

40:51.971 --> 40:53.494
to protect the cocaine
operation.

40:53.538 --> 40:55.583
Even told us where we could
find the weapon.

40:55.627 --> 40:58.760
- Okay, great, so...

40:58.804 --> 41:01.067
can I leave now?

41:04.679 --> 41:07.290
-  It's not gonna
be that simple.

41:11.120 --> 41:13.079
The U.S. Attorney's Office

41:13.122 --> 41:17.518
is gonna file charges
against you.

41:17.562 --> 41:20.042
- What?

41:22.697 --> 41:26.701
You said that wouldn't happen.
You gave me your word, Maggie.

41:30.183 --> 41:32.185
- I'm sorry.

41:34.666 --> 41:39.540
I did everything--

41:39.584 --> 41:42.456
everything I could.

41:55.948 --> 41:58.124
I know.

42:09.265 --> 42:11.790
- Yeah, it's on
the top of the desk.

42:16.098 --> 42:18.448
You okay?

42:18.492 --> 42:20.886
- Not really.

42:20.929 --> 42:22.191
- Well, if you want to talk,

42:22.235 --> 42:24.106
I'm actually a pretty good
listener.

42:24.150 --> 42:25.847
- Since when?

42:25.891 --> 42:28.850
- Since now.

42:28.894 --> 42:32.375
- Thank you.
