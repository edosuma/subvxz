00:00.524 --> 00:04.656
"Martha's tiny chest
pulsed its final beats.

00:04.681 --> 00:07.970
"I would never hear her lone coo again.

00:08.052 --> 00:10.313
"The last of its kind.

00:10.487 --> 00:11.893
"Coo.

00:11.918 --> 00:14.703
Coo. Coo."

00:14.728 --> 00:17.958
I'll pay you 100 bucks
if you start cooing back.

00:19.339 --> 00:21.183
Stop it.

00:22.235 --> 00:23.866
I know this book is subtle,

00:23.891 --> 00:26.100
but I really think it
will captivate people.

00:26.125 --> 00:28.026
Even with the Booker Prize buzz,

00:28.051 --> 00:30.236
the second week of sales is anemic.

00:30.261 --> 00:32.461
"In the way that she would recognize."

00:32.647 --> 00:34.581
Probably have to cancel her book tour.

00:34.606 --> 00:36.377
Not like we can afford one anyway.

00:36.402 --> 00:37.435
What do you mean?

00:37.460 --> 00:38.817
Liza, don't be dense.

00:40.013 --> 00:41.235
Without Bryce's investment,

00:41.259 --> 00:42.648
the company's in trouble.

00:42.773 --> 00:45.257
I don't think this is
the book to save us.

00:54.448 --> 00:55.696
Lovely event, ladies.

00:55.721 --> 00:57.620
We're back to our old ways,
elegant and tasteful.

00:57.645 --> 00:59.800
I, for one,
don't think we ever needed Bryce.

00:59.825 --> 01:02.424
Empirical will stand the test of time.

01:02.449 --> 01:03.714
Ah.

01:03.739 --> 01:05.969
Radha, you remember Liza.

01:05.995 --> 01:07.762
Yes, delighted to see you again.

01:07.787 --> 01:10.654
And this is Diana, our marketing genius.

01:10.679 --> 01:11.547
Oh, well.

01:11.571 --> 01:13.644
Radha is the newly appointed director

01:13.669 --> 01:16.248
for the Rockefeller
Nonprofit Repositioning Fund.

01:16.273 --> 01:18.273
The RNRF? Congratulations.

01:18.298 --> 01:19.657
Well, congratulations to you.

01:19.682 --> 01:21.693
Charles told me that you
championed this book.

01:21.717 --> 01:22.809
Well done.

01:22.834 --> 01:25.335
Well, my one desire
is to service Charles.

01:27.269 --> 01:28.960
Excuse us.

01:28.985 --> 01:30.849
Yeah.

01:31.717 --> 01:34.015
What on earth does he see in her?

01:34.461 --> 01:36.485
Do I have cabernet teeth?

01:36.510 --> 01:37.595
No, you're good.

01:37.620 --> 01:38.824
Okay.

01:40.339 --> 01:41.605
Liza!

01:41.630 --> 01:42.661
Yay!

01:42.686 --> 01:43.969
Hey, you guys!

01:43.994 --> 01:45.320
Hi! Ahh!

01:45.344 --> 01:46.750
I thought you were sleeping.

01:46.776 --> 01:49.070
- She was drawing.
- I'm going to be an artist.

01:49.095 --> 01:53.051
I'm going to be a
dermatologist or a jump-roper.

01:54.064 --> 01:56.136
Well, the time is now, the walrus said,

01:56.169 --> 01:57.945
for all good children to go to bed.

01:57.970 --> 01:58.899
- No.
- Not yet.

01:58.924 --> 02:02.159
But your stuffed animals
are all alone in the dark.

02:02.917 --> 02:04.217
She's right.

02:04.242 --> 02:06.154
Yeah, Daddy said we're moving soon,

02:06.179 --> 02:08.645
but don't worry,
we can bring all of our stuffies.

02:08.670 --> 02:09.839
Moving? Where?

02:09.863 --> 02:11.644
To a place more affordable.

02:11.669 --> 02:14.372
He needs money for his business.

02:14.397 --> 02:17.413
I said we might move, girls.

02:17.438 --> 02:19.712
But we may not have to.

02:22.192 --> 02:25.523
I'm hoping I can convince
Edward L.L. Moore

02:25.548 --> 02:28.244
to write another book in the
"Crown of Kings" series...

02:29.412 --> 02:30.778
tomorrow.

02:30.803 --> 02:32.943
Well, just let me know
if Princess Pam Pam

02:32.968 --> 02:34.694
needs to make an appearance.

02:34.836 --> 02:36.098
Actually, you know, I take that back.

02:36.123 --> 02:37.556
I just remembered the fur bikini.

02:37.581 --> 02:40.140
I don't mean to trouble you with this.

02:40.408 --> 02:44.014
He's just one author I'd never
want to see leave Empirical.

02:44.039 --> 02:46.622
What are you naughty
girls still doing up?

02:46.923 --> 02:49.890
All right, it is time for bed.

02:49.915 --> 02:50.806
Say good night.

02:50.831 --> 02:52.325
Good night.

02:52.849 --> 02:55.134
- Good night.
- Good night.

02:55.159 --> 02:56.180
Nice to see you guys.

02:56.205 --> 02:57.188
Hello again.

02:57.213 --> 02:58.397
Hi.

03:07.455 --> 03:08.626
There you are.

03:08.651 --> 03:10.153
- Hey.
- Come here.

03:10.178 --> 03:12.436
I got something to show you.

03:21.444 --> 03:22.843
What are you doing?

03:22.868 --> 03:25.037
You're just so sexy when you're working,
I just...

03:25.062 --> 03:26.674
Oh.

03:28.596 --> 03:29.562
Oh.

03:29.587 --> 03:31.429
Oh, no, no, no, not here.

03:31.454 --> 03:32.361
Why, why not?

03:32.386 --> 03:33.852
Because this is my boss's house.

03:33.877 --> 03:34.598
That's why.

03:34.624 --> 03:35.839
Yeah.

03:35.863 --> 03:38.663
That's exactly why it's so hot.

03:46.632 --> 03:48.490
Okay, we can't.

03:48.515 --> 03:50.949
Babe, your away game is just...

03:50.974 --> 03:52.708
It's a little weak right now.

03:52.733 --> 03:53.571
That's all.

03:53.597 --> 03:55.303
All right, you know
what, back in the day,

03:55.327 --> 03:57.604
I did it on a park slide

03:57.630 --> 03:59.913
and once in a Big Boy drive-in.

03:59.937 --> 04:02.323
- So, you know...
- Wow.

04:02.348 --> 04:05.838
My "back in the day"
is happening right now,

04:05.863 --> 04:09.428
and I'm gonna need stories
to tell the 26-year-old

04:09.453 --> 04:11.667
that I'm gonna date when I'm 40.

04:13.873 --> 04:16.524
All right, later, okay?

04:16.550 --> 04:17.548
I promise.

04:17.574 --> 04:19.387
Mm.

04:31.513 --> 04:34.104
Who is Aubrey Alexis?

04:34.129 --> 04:37.036
She's a newcomer,
and she's going to be huge.

04:37.062 --> 04:38.443
Everyone in town's
going to want this book,

04:38.468 --> 04:40.049
but I'm bringing it to you first

04:40.074 --> 04:42.694
because I respect you as a woman.

04:42.998 --> 04:44.118
You have nice hair.

04:44.143 --> 04:46.345
Et cetera, et cetera.

04:46.370 --> 04:47.681
Oh hello, tall girl.

04:47.706 --> 04:48.311
Hi.

04:48.336 --> 04:49.368
Name's still Liza.

04:49.393 --> 04:50.575
- Mm-hmm.
- Listen.

04:50.601 --> 04:52.880
Redmond is adamant
that we are missing out

04:52.904 --> 04:55.006
if we don't buy "Me, Myself, and O."

04:55.031 --> 04:56.097
It's about a young woman

04:56.122 --> 04:57.713
who sleeps her away
across four continents

04:57.738 --> 04:59.447
in search of the perfect orgasm.

04:59.472 --> 05:02.106
She bangs a lot of guys, and in the end,

05:02.131 --> 05:05.149
she realizes the perfect
orgasm is with herself.

05:05.174 --> 05:06.163
Oh.

05:06.188 --> 05:07.065
Don't be scurred.

05:07.090 --> 05:08.942
I'm not scurred.

05:12.578 --> 05:14.513
"I learned to embrace my love of sex.

05:14.537 --> 05:16.443
"It was sunrise at Borobudur,

05:16.468 --> 05:18.702
"the world's most
sacred Buddhist temple.

05:18.727 --> 05:22.018
"We exchanged a serene glance,
and before I knew it,

05:22.043 --> 05:26.299
"Matthius had my face pressed
against a perforated stupa.

05:26.679 --> 05:29.136
Oh, how my blood ran soft."

05:29.161 --> 05:30.981
Huh! Hot, huh?

05:31.006 --> 05:32.179
- Uh!
- Yeah.

05:32.204 --> 05:33.748
I'm bringing it to you first,

05:33.773 --> 05:35.834
- but it's not gonna be cheap.
- Oh, god.

05:35.859 --> 05:38.835
I just love how sex-positive
the narrative is.

05:38.859 --> 05:40.137
Well, when can we meet the author?

05:40.162 --> 05:41.106
Oh, you can't.

05:41.132 --> 05:42.754
She does not want to appear in public.

05:42.778 --> 05:44.643
The book will have to stand for itself.

05:45.458 --> 05:47.425
Can we make a deal with an expensive

05:47.450 --> 05:49.194
first-time writer who
won't appear in public?

05:49.219 --> 05:50.800
We never have before.

05:51.166 --> 05:52.836
I'll give you a moment
to think about it.

05:52.861 --> 05:54.102
Tick tock, moment's up.

05:54.127 --> 05:56.228
Redmond, this is crazy.

05:56.357 --> 05:59.098
I'm sorry, but we're gonna have to pass.

06:02.480 --> 06:04.515
Big mistake, ladies.

06:04.540 --> 06:06.238
Big mistake.

06:12.156 --> 06:14.237
Charles, would you like me to sit in

06:14.262 --> 06:15.791
on the Edward L.L. Moore meeting?

06:15.816 --> 06:18.580
No, this needs to be one-to-one.

06:19.247 --> 06:23.549
Dried cherries, marcona almonds,
Orbit peppermint gum.

06:23.793 --> 06:26.434
Snack protocols written
into his contract.

06:26.459 --> 06:27.464
Ah.

06:27.950 --> 06:29.070
Good luck.

06:29.095 --> 06:30.915
We are all begging for more "COK."

06:32.044 --> 06:34.998
I mean "Crown of Kings,"

06:35.023 --> 06:36.952
of course is C-O-K.

06:36.977 --> 06:38.422
I never said that acronym out loud.

06:38.447 --> 06:40.761
I always just read it, alone in my head.

06:41.344 --> 06:44.322
Your fans are dying for the next book.

06:44.347 --> 06:46.546
No, no, no, definitely done.

06:46.571 --> 06:50.167
You have just built such
an enormous readership.

06:50.541 --> 06:52.315
It's a shame to abandon them.

06:52.340 --> 06:54.551
I know what you're
trying to do, Charles:

06:54.576 --> 06:55.859
put me in a box.

06:55.883 --> 06:58.894
I'm sorry I can't save Empirical,

06:58.920 --> 07:01.866
but there are plenty of new authors

07:01.891 --> 07:03.758
yet to be discovered who can.

07:03.783 --> 07:05.487
Of course.

07:05.739 --> 07:07.702
You're right.

07:16.583 --> 07:17.971
Princess Pam Pam!

07:17.996 --> 07:18.961
Jesus Christ!

07:18.986 --> 07:20.698
No, just me.

07:23.752 --> 07:25.534
Look at you.

07:26.064 --> 07:29.781
Oh, how my blood runs soft.

07:42.719 --> 07:44.352
Oh my god.

07:44.377 --> 07:46.815
Both dedications are made out
"to the sugar in my bowl."

07:46.840 --> 07:48.181
And look, in book four

07:48.206 --> 07:50.614
it's the same Buddhist
temple at Borobudur.

07:50.639 --> 07:53.977
Princess Pam Pam fingers her braids

07:54.002 --> 07:56.636
in the same "eager yet determined" way

07:56.661 --> 07:58.684
that Aubrey fingers herself
at the end of the book.

07:58.709 --> 08:00.544
And Aubrey's South African boyfriend

08:00.569 --> 08:03.337
and Master Denton both
follow the same pattern of

08:03.362 --> 08:05.643
"twitch, giggle,
and burst" when they climax.

08:05.668 --> 08:06.721
Oh my god.

08:06.825 --> 08:09.878
So many hot throbbing
orbs and humming obelisks.

08:11.002 --> 08:12.275
Aubrey Alexis...

08:12.301 --> 08:15.221
is L.L. Moore.

08:17.326 --> 08:19.121
Ugh.

08:22.494 --> 08:24.247
Redmond, come on.

08:24.272 --> 08:26.683
Is Edward L.L. Moore
really Aubrey Alexis?

08:26.708 --> 08:28.064
I told you.

08:28.089 --> 08:29.553
I cannot comment.

08:29.578 --> 08:31.344
But danke for the Cobb salad.

08:32.265 --> 08:35.027
You know, I told your
boyfriend that you were with me

08:35.052 --> 08:37.039
when you were actually
making out with Connor Bracks

08:37.063 --> 08:38.424
at the Young Lions reading last month.

08:38.448 --> 08:39.923
You owe me.

08:42.202 --> 08:44.970
Even if I did know,
I would've already signed a very scary,

08:44.995 --> 08:49.057
very serious, on the life of my pug,
airtight NDA.

08:49.082 --> 08:50.709
Well, could you maybe wink twice

08:50.734 --> 08:52.992
if "yes" accidentally for us?

08:54.648 --> 08:59.584
Look, Nancy Drew and leggier Nancy Drew.

08:59.609 --> 09:03.178
You really should just
"beware the wrath of the sky,"

09:03.180 --> 09:04.079
you feel me?

09:04.104 --> 09:04.867
What did you just say?

09:04.893 --> 09:06.579
I just casually said

09:06.604 --> 09:10.543
to "beware the wrath of the sky."

09:10.568 --> 09:12.525
Don't make a big deal about it.

09:12.550 --> 09:16.005
Well, we've had a change of
heart about Aubrey Alexis,

09:16.030 --> 09:18.557
and we would love to publish the book.

09:18.669 --> 09:19.901
Too late.

09:20.029 --> 09:21.271
Lena Dunham's imprint

09:21.296 --> 09:23.296
has been looking for their own "big O."

09:23.321 --> 09:24.444
All I had to do was mention

09:24.469 --> 09:27.037
there was masturbation with a
new object in every chapter,

09:27.061 --> 09:28.956
and Lena made an offer.

09:29.052 --> 09:30.693
You already shopped it?

09:30.718 --> 09:32.241
Kelsey,

09:32.582 --> 09:34.517
when I tell you to take
something off the market,

09:34.542 --> 09:37.569
I want you to take it off the market.

09:37.594 --> 09:41.797
Perhaps next time you will trust
me to live and speak my truth.

09:41.822 --> 09:42.652
Okay, thanks.

09:42.677 --> 09:44.004
Bye.

09:46.071 --> 09:47.479
Edward L.L. Moore

09:47.504 --> 09:49.745
is Empirical's biggest
money maker by far.

09:49.770 --> 09:51.770
We cannot let him go
to another publisher,

09:51.795 --> 09:53.698
even with a book written
under a pseudonym.

09:54.441 --> 09:56.943
I have a plan B. It makes me sick but...

09:56.968 --> 09:58.746
Well, you can't take
those on an empty stomach.

09:58.771 --> 10:00.559
That's key.

10:00.874 --> 10:03.470
You have an actual plan, not the pill.

10:03.635 --> 10:05.028
Never mind.

10:21.362 --> 10:24.924
You know, I've always wanted
to date a nice Jewish girl.

10:24.949 --> 10:27.178
I'm not so sure about the "nice" part.

10:27.202 --> 10:29.438
Yeah, I just think it's
so cool how you've managed

10:29.464 --> 10:31.708
to hold on to your faith
and your sexuality.

10:31.733 --> 10:33.780
Well, there are a lot of
Orthodykes in Brooklyn.

10:33.805 --> 10:34.836
So it helps.

10:34.861 --> 10:36.150
You know, the nuns at St. Mary's

10:36.175 --> 10:38.263
almost scared me straight.

10:38.288 --> 10:40.502
I'm so glad they didn't.

10:41.694 --> 10:43.846
Well, well, well.

10:43.871 --> 10:45.590
- Look who it is.
- Hey!

10:45.615 --> 10:47.867
Maggie,
this is one of my best friends, Sarah.

10:47.892 --> 10:49.491
Also the ex.

10:49.516 --> 10:50.930
Oh, the ex turned BFF.

10:50.955 --> 10:52.387
I have many of you, Sarah.

10:52.412 --> 10:53.452
Yeah?

10:53.477 --> 10:55.053
- I've heard a lot about you.
- Oh.

10:55.078 --> 10:56.745
I can't believe I've
never seen you out before.

10:56.770 --> 10:58.042
I mean, I'm always here.

10:58.067 --> 11:00.635
Well, I've been focused
on my tomato patch.

11:00.660 --> 11:03.145
Who needs a bar when you
belong to a community garden?

11:03.171 --> 11:05.563
Well, not exactly our community.

11:06.537 --> 11:08.583
Sarah is the one I was telling you about

11:08.608 --> 11:10.751
who owns the Halal Spiritual
Spa on Kent Street.

11:10.776 --> 11:13.198
It's just a place for our
group to gather at night.

11:13.223 --> 11:15.292
Light some candles, splash around.

11:15.317 --> 11:16.686
It's very exclusive.

11:16.711 --> 11:18.189
Mm. Sounds nice.

11:18.215 --> 11:20.308
Malks, are you coming tomorrow night

11:20.333 --> 11:21.513
for the full moon kavanot?

11:21.538 --> 11:22.874
I'll call you.

11:22.899 --> 11:24.322
Well,

11:24.346 --> 11:27.994
it was very nice to finally
meet the famous Maggie.

11:32.774 --> 11:37.692
_

11:37.717 --> 11:39.583
Sorry, work.

11:39.968 --> 11:42.869
So, how did you know it was me?

11:44.033 --> 11:46.206
Well, I didn't at first.

11:46.231 --> 11:48.656
But I immediately knew it
couldn't be a first-time writer.

11:48.681 --> 11:49.802
It was too masterful.

11:50.587 --> 11:52.879
But then I wondered,
"what female writer"

11:52.904 --> 11:55.365
possesses that kind of literary prowess

11:55.391 --> 11:57.103
"but would need to hide
behind a pseudonym?"

11:57.127 --> 11:58.718
I mean, it couldn't be J.K. Rowling...

11:58.743 --> 11:59.458
again.

11:59.483 --> 12:01.106
Well, that was your first mistake.

12:01.131 --> 12:03.295
You assumed it had to be a woman.

12:03.321 --> 12:04.011
Of course.

12:04.036 --> 12:04.950
Everyone will.

12:04.976 --> 12:07.044
So what finally led you to me?

12:07.069 --> 12:09.743
"Oh, how my blood runs soft."

12:09.768 --> 12:12.560
- Ah.
- You wanted to be found.

12:12.754 --> 12:15.768
And you are diabolically clever.

12:16.079 --> 12:17.679
I'm curious.

12:17.704 --> 12:21.750
How do you manage to get inside
the mind of a young woman

12:21.775 --> 12:25.608
with such incredible insight?

12:26.421 --> 12:29.583
It started as a writing exercise.

12:29.608 --> 12:34.048
I needed to get as far away from
"Crown of Kings" as possible,

12:34.288 --> 12:37.280
all those dwarves and beheadings.

12:37.305 --> 12:40.963
And one morning, her
voice just came to me.

12:41.246 --> 12:45.507
This young woman
overflowing with desire.

12:45.532 --> 12:48.251
There was so much she needed to say,

12:48.419 --> 12:51.867
and as I liberated Aubrey,

12:51.892 --> 12:54.582
she was liberating me.

12:54.863 --> 12:56.796
That's actually really beautiful.

12:56.821 --> 12:58.248
Yes, it is.

12:58.376 --> 13:00.047
What about Charles?

13:00.072 --> 13:01.798
Did he figure this out too?

13:01.823 --> 13:04.354
Charles actually has
no idea that I'm here.

13:04.379 --> 13:05.323
Good.

13:05.349 --> 13:07.376
Aubrey is very dear to my heart.

13:07.401 --> 13:10.578
Leaving her vulnerable to the
public would be devastating.

13:10.603 --> 13:12.501
I'm as excited about
bringing Aubrey Alexis

13:12.527 --> 13:13.728
to the world as you are.

13:13.753 --> 13:15.763
And I'm not sure people will find her

13:15.788 --> 13:17.332
as inspiring and empowering

13:17.357 --> 13:19.645
in the ways of the female
orgasm if they knew...

13:22.464 --> 13:24.493
Your secret is safe...

13:24.978 --> 13:27.186
is all I mean to say.

13:27.211 --> 13:28.217
Good.

13:28.242 --> 13:30.774
But before I go with you, Pam Pam,

13:31.001 --> 13:34.470
there's one more thing
you have to do for me.

13:34.893 --> 13:36.683
What's that?

13:37.325 --> 13:40.358
Double your original offer.

13:56.694 --> 13:59.162
Charles, do you have a minute?

13:59.187 --> 14:00.719
Yeah, sure.

14:00.744 --> 14:03.217
In light of new developments,

14:03.242 --> 14:06.110
Millennial would like to acquire "Me,
Myself, and O."

14:06.389 --> 14:09.886
Liza and I feel it is a
ground-breaking story,

14:09.911 --> 14:11.838
and that women of all ages will connect

14:11.863 --> 14:15.515
with its honesty and its
uniquely female message.

14:15.540 --> 14:18.916
But we would have to double the
offer to outbid Lena Dunham.

14:18.941 --> 14:20.203
We already passed on this.

14:20.228 --> 14:22.964
What's changed besides a
competition with Lena Dunham?

14:22.989 --> 14:25.343
Legally, we're not allowed to say.

14:25.369 --> 14:27.536
I really don't have time for this today.

14:27.561 --> 14:29.971
I got to jump on a conference call.

14:42.925 --> 14:44.192
We have to get this book.

14:44.217 --> 14:45.498
Please, trust me.

14:45.523 --> 14:46.431
Liza, I...

14:46.456 --> 14:47.996
Aubrey is not an unknown author.

14:48.021 --> 14:49.452
She's someone in the Empirical family

14:49.477 --> 14:50.842
we don't want making a relationship

14:50.867 --> 14:52.017
with another publisher.

14:52.042 --> 14:52.795
Who?

14:52.820 --> 14:54.896
I can't tell you more,

14:55.112 --> 14:59.246
but she's not who she says she is.

15:01.320 --> 15:04.771
She's an old soul,

15:05.061 --> 15:06.792
if you know what I mean,

15:06.817 --> 15:09.861
and kind of mannish.

15:09.995 --> 15:11.262
Okay, um,

15:11.287 --> 15:15.170
she has a very large personality

15:15.195 --> 15:18.498
and a really, scary laugh.

15:19.998 --> 15:21.258
Chelsea Handler?

15:22.767 --> 15:24.306
Um...

15:31.525 --> 15:33.967
That's not possible.

15:37.061 --> 15:39.486
Thank you for coming to me with this.

15:39.510 --> 15:41.240
Make the offer, whatever it takes.

15:41.265 --> 15:42.960
I don't care if the book sells,

15:42.985 --> 15:44.866
we have to keep him in-house and happy.

15:44.891 --> 15:45.958
Her.

15:45.984 --> 15:47.851
He can't find out I told you or...

15:47.882 --> 15:51.145
Now it's your turn to trust me.

16:08.608 --> 16:10.241
Oh, what's up with the poncho?

16:10.266 --> 16:12.568
I'm thinking about
letting Josh get under it

16:12.593 --> 16:13.592
in Prospect Park.

16:13.617 --> 16:15.088
Oh, you have come so far.

16:15.113 --> 16:16.679
- I am proud of you.
- Mm.

16:16.709 --> 16:18.075
Listen, I was just coming in here

16:18.100 --> 16:20.460
to ask you a huge and
embarrassing favor.

16:20.485 --> 16:22.825
Do you think you could put Josh
on hold for just a couple hours

16:22.850 --> 16:24.922
and come to a Spiritual Spa with me?

16:24.947 --> 16:25.761
Come again?

16:25.786 --> 16:27.289
I'm having lesbian drama.

16:27.314 --> 16:27.999
Oh.

16:28.024 --> 16:29.033
Yeah, I met the ex.

16:29.057 --> 16:30.953
Heavy duty. Toes have never seen polish.

16:30.978 --> 16:32.845
- Opposite of you.
- 100%.

16:32.870 --> 16:34.503
And she still has feelings for Malkie.

16:34.528 --> 16:35.778
I mean, it's obvious,

16:35.803 --> 16:37.607
and they're naked at some Spa together.

16:37.632 --> 16:39.792
I hate to admit that it bothers me,
but it bothers me.

16:39.817 --> 16:41.517
I just feel like an emo teen.

16:41.542 --> 16:43.275
You know what, let's do it.

16:43.300 --> 16:47.005
Just let me put some underwear on first.

16:51.461 --> 16:52.425
Hi.

16:52.450 --> 16:53.555
What kind of bathhouse is this?

16:53.580 --> 16:54.406
I don't know.

16:54.431 --> 16:55.856
Would you like to check your wig?

16:55.881 --> 16:57.735
Oh no, honey, this is my hair.

16:57.760 --> 17:00.060
Oh.

17:03.318 --> 17:05.669
_

17:06.230 --> 17:08.914
_

17:14.626 --> 17:15.925
I'm sorry.

17:17.858 --> 17:19.752
Let's do this.

17:22.448 --> 17:26.102
I'm not sure we're really
supposed to be here.

17:26.127 --> 17:28.613
You know what, there's Malkie and Sarah.

17:28.637 --> 17:29.878
I'm going in.

17:31.388 --> 17:32.198
Okay.

17:40.250 --> 17:42.152
There's a shiksa in the mikveh!

17:42.177 --> 17:43.328
Run!

17:59.929 --> 18:01.228
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

18:01.254 --> 18:02.656
You know, I didn't realize.

18:02.681 --> 18:05.430
I mean, in my defense,
she said "spiritual."

18:05.455 --> 18:08.277
I didn't realize it was a
full-blown Jewish thing,

18:08.302 --> 18:08.932
you know?

18:08.957 --> 18:10.559
I thought you knew about the mikveh.

18:10.584 --> 18:12.058
That's why I didn't invite you.

18:12.083 --> 18:14.496
Now I feel like a total
stalker, you know.

18:14.521 --> 18:16.064
That's like so not me, you know?

18:16.089 --> 18:18.193
I haven't liked somebody
like this in so long,

18:18.218 --> 18:19.198
and now you're probably

18:19.223 --> 18:20.264
never gonna want to see me again.

18:20.289 --> 18:21.331
Hey.

18:21.780 --> 18:23.546
Mm.

18:23.706 --> 18:26.515
Honestly, I would be jealous as hell

18:26.540 --> 18:28.379
if you were naked anywhere with your ex.

18:28.404 --> 18:31.442
From now on,
I am not leaving you out of anything,

18:31.468 --> 18:33.444
holidays, prayers.

18:33.493 --> 18:35.135
Do you have plans tomorrow night?

18:35.160 --> 18:38.561
- What's tomorrow night?
- It's sort of a ritual.

18:38.586 --> 18:40.217
Do you have cleats?

18:49.474 --> 18:53.634
Okay, I'm gonna drop this off
at Redmond's for Aubrey to sign.

18:53.960 --> 18:56.283
- Oh, we did it, girl.
- I know.

18:56.308 --> 18:57.733
This could be huge for Millennial.

18:57.758 --> 18:58.578
Okay, I know.

18:58.603 --> 18:59.977
Let's not jinx it by over-celebrating.

19:00.002 --> 19:02.161
Okay, maybe just a hand hug?

19:02.186 --> 19:03.779
Okay.

19:07.088 --> 19:08.356
All right, that's good. That's good.

19:08.381 --> 19:09.812
Okay, yeah. Then we're done.

19:16.933 --> 19:18.934
I'm just saying good night.

19:19.596 --> 19:23.790
That was a big save, Liza.

19:23.815 --> 19:27.377
You mean a big acquisition
of an unknown author.

19:27.402 --> 19:30.973
I only break this out
for special occasions.

19:36.973 --> 19:38.179
To Aubrey.

19:38.204 --> 19:40.537
May she sell like Edward.

19:41.420 --> 19:43.219
Cheers.

19:51.326 --> 19:56.211
My grandfather always said

19:56.236 --> 19:59.404
the true joy of publishing

19:59.429 --> 20:01.267
is taking pleasure in each project.

20:01.292 --> 20:02.303
Hmm.

20:02.328 --> 20:03.940
It wasn't about making money for him.

20:04.166 --> 20:06.265
It was like collecting art.

20:06.290 --> 20:08.106
But at least in this business

20:08.131 --> 20:10.187
there's a chance you'll
come across a piece of art

20:10.212 --> 20:12.358
while trying to make money, right?

20:12.383 --> 20:13.256
Yeah.

20:13.281 --> 20:14.388
Every now and then,

20:14.413 --> 20:18.092
something really unexpected comes along.

20:20.740 --> 20:23.355
I've been waiting for you in the lobby.

20:23.380 --> 20:26.325
I am so sorry.

20:26.351 --> 20:27.817
I just have to

20:27.841 --> 20:30.040
grab some mockups from Art.

20:30.065 --> 20:31.162
I'll be right back.

20:31.186 --> 20:32.425
Okay.

20:32.970 --> 20:34.653
- Sorry.
- Drinks at work?

20:34.904 --> 20:36.170
Oh, uh...

20:36.195 --> 20:38.376
yeah, we were kind of celebrating.

20:38.800 --> 20:41.436
Well, I know Charles thinks
you're very valuable.

20:41.461 --> 20:43.169
Oh, good.

20:43.194 --> 20:45.539
It's always nice to know
when the boss likes you.

20:45.564 --> 20:47.054
I mean, likes your work...

20:47.080 --> 20:48.221
as an employee.

20:50.465 --> 20:52.513
Tell me about yourself, Liza.

20:53.267 --> 20:56.641
Oh, where do I start?

20:56.666 --> 20:58.165
At the beginning.

20:58.343 --> 21:00.476
I would love to know
everything there is to know

21:00.501 --> 21:02.437
about the young woman
who spends so much time

21:02.462 --> 21:04.260
with the man that I am just...

21:04.285 --> 21:06.190
crazy about.

21:07.775 --> 21:08.944
Ready?

21:08.969 --> 21:11.923
Well, we'll have to grab lunch sometime.

21:11.948 --> 21:13.521
Sounds great.

21:13.656 --> 21:14.822
Good night.

21:14.847 --> 21:17.102
Good night.

21:17.467 --> 21:20.011
- Good night.
- Good night.

21:30.271 --> 21:32.290
You know what? Hand me my mitt.

21:32.315 --> 21:33.523
You own a mitt?

21:33.548 --> 21:34.827
Of course. It's in my duffle.

21:34.852 --> 21:35.861
Duffle?

21:35.886 --> 21:37.615
Shut up.

21:37.848 --> 21:39.831
What's your game plan here, Mags?

21:39.856 --> 21:40.997
I have no idea.

21:41.022 --> 21:42.275
Well, you know they can run,

21:42.301 --> 21:43.838
just don't let them get on base.

21:43.863 --> 21:44.996
All right!

21:45.021 --> 21:48.528
Let's get this show started, ladies!

21:48.553 --> 21:50.670
I must really like Malkie.

21:50.695 --> 21:53.153
I think you do!

21:54.367 --> 21:55.920
Well, you know, babe.

21:55.945 --> 21:59.446
This isn't really the kind of away game

21:59.471 --> 22:00.798
I was thinking about but...

22:00.823 --> 22:04.238
Oh, you were thinking more like...

22:04.286 --> 22:06.073
