00:13.013 --> 00:16.308
Hey there, little fella. I wanna introduce
you to some other animals...

00:16.391 --> 00:18.644
- that I ate yesterday.
- Stop!

00:18.727 --> 00:21.021
You don't eat bunducky.

00:21.104 --> 00:26.026
Kids, who wants to explain to this
grown-up why he's horribly wrong?

00:26.652 --> 00:31.448
Bunducky is the prey that lures in
bigger food. It's our food's food.

00:34.952 --> 00:36.245
[blows raspberry]

00:42.084 --> 00:44.920
You think you can flash
your burning hot skin at me, sun?

00:45.003 --> 00:49.758
- Well, two can play that game.
- Grug, we talked about this.

00:49.841 --> 00:51.843
Naked bodies are disgusting.

00:51.927 --> 00:54.054
But that was about Gran.

00:54.137 --> 00:55.681
No exceptions.

00:59.726 --> 01:01.645
[grunting]

01:02.938 --> 01:05.107
[exhaling]
So what's my share of meat?

01:05.190 --> 01:07.276
Better be big
after what I went through.

01:09.111 --> 01:11.780
[groaning]
What? Seriously? That's it?

01:11.863 --> 01:15.117
Oh? Grug have better way
to split meat fairly?

01:15.200 --> 01:17.286
- Amber listening.
- Uh...

01:17.369 --> 01:21.790
[laughs] Amber kidding.
Amber not listening.

01:24.584 --> 01:27.838
Sorry I'm late. I had to pull an extra
shift to catch enough meat for dinner.

01:27.921 --> 01:30.048
[screaming]

01:34.011 --> 01:37.014
[groans] It just tunneled in here.
Chase it off, quick!

01:39.182 --> 01:41.435
[sighs]

01:41.518 --> 01:44.271
Shoo! Ha! Get out, you big, squinty pest.

01:44.604 --> 01:45.522
[grunting]

01:45.605 --> 01:47.858
That is it!

01:47.941 --> 01:49.443
- [laughs]
- [grunting]

01:49.860 --> 01:51.612
I am sick of this valley.

01:51.695 --> 01:55.115
Being part of a community was
supposed to make life easier,

01:55.198 --> 01:59.536
but all people do here is boss me around
and make me wear clothes.

01:59.620 --> 02:01.330
- I want you to wear clothes.
- Me, too.

02:01.413 --> 02:03.081
Please wear clothes.

02:03.874 --> 02:05.500
I feel your pain.

02:05.584 --> 02:11.590
We should vacate Ahhh! Valley and shun it.
Yeah, we need a vacate-shun.

02:11.673 --> 02:13.717
Wait, we can vacate the valley?

02:13.800 --> 02:16.261
You told me if I wandered
too far from home,

02:16.345 --> 02:19.931
I'd fall off a cliff into
"never-ending darkness."

02:20.015 --> 02:22.184
[chuckles] We tell you a lot of things.

02:22.267 --> 02:26.021
[chuckles]
Where would we even go? The sky?

02:26.104 --> 02:28.148
[gasps] I can live in the sky.

02:28.231 --> 02:30.901
[laughs] I'm comin', clouds!

02:30.984 --> 02:33.695
No, we'll go to the wilderness.

02:33.779 --> 02:37.074
Yeah, we'll live like the cavemen did
in the old days

02:37.157 --> 02:41.953
before everyone got into these crazy
new ideas like "helping each other."

02:42.037 --> 02:43.789
Grug, this is our home.

02:43.872 --> 02:45.165
All of our stuff's here.

02:45.248 --> 02:48.460
Our rocks, our mud,
our cave wall paintings.

02:48.543 --> 02:51.254
Eep, you haven't made
cave paintings in forever.

02:51.338 --> 02:53.340
I might go back to them next season.

02:53.423 --> 02:55.842
We both know you never have
time for those anymore.

02:55.926 --> 03:00.180
Besides, on a vacate-shun,
there is no school.

03:00.263 --> 03:02.099
Ugga, there's no cavework.

03:02.182 --> 03:05.519
Sandy,
there's lots of new territory to mark.

03:05.602 --> 03:07.938
- Gran, same goes for you.
- [chomps]

03:08.021 --> 03:12.317
And best of all,
I won't have to listen to anyone.

03:13.110 --> 03:14.403
[laughing]

03:14.486 --> 03:17.322
The Croods are going on vacate-shun.

03:19.699 --> 03:20.699
Bye!

03:20.742 --> 03:23.453
And don't forget your stink. Ugh!

03:23.912 --> 03:26.123
[gasps, sniffs]

03:26.206 --> 03:28.834
[sighs]

03:28.917 --> 03:32.129
Have fun, Eep. I'll call you every day.

03:32.212 --> 03:36.675
Like this. Eep!
Ee-eep!

03:36.758 --> 03:39.386
So, see Croods when Croods come back.

03:39.469 --> 03:40.554
Oh, you got it.

03:40.637 --> 03:42.931
[chuckles] If we ever come back.

03:44.683 --> 03:46.393
<i>♪ Bom-bom, bom-ba-dum ♪</i>

03:46.476 --> 03:51.356
<i>♪ Ma-ma-ma-bom-ba-dum
Ba-da-dum ♪</i>

03:52.482 --> 03:55.193
<i>♪ Ninety-nine flies

03:55.277 --> 03:57.487
<i>♪ Ninety-nine flies on the corpse ♪</i>

03:57.571 --> 04:00.198
<i>♪ Swat one down, smash it around ♪</i>

04:00.282 --> 04:03.285
<i>♪ Ninety-eight flies

04:03.368 --> 04:04.453
Isn't this great?

04:04.536 --> 04:07.581
No one telling us what to eat
or how naked we can be.

04:07.664 --> 04:09.040
Hey, what are you doing?

04:09.124 --> 04:12.210
Making a map so we know how to get home.

04:12.294 --> 04:13.545
Oh, we won't need that.

04:13.628 --> 04:15.172
Why? 'Cause you'll remember the way?

04:15.255 --> 04:16.964
Sure. That's why.

04:17.048 --> 04:20.385
Besides, you're missing out
on all this scenery.

04:24.055 --> 04:27.350
- Ow! Mom, Sandy bit me.
- [growling]

04:27.434 --> 04:30.187
Bite her back.
Show her who's the alpha.

04:30.270 --> 04:32.647
Oh, can't I just submit?

04:32.731 --> 04:34.816
[whimpering, shouts]

04:34.900 --> 04:38.153
No. Don't make me
come back there and bite her for you.

04:38.236 --> 04:40.697
[groans] I wish these kids
would stop acting up.

04:40.781 --> 04:42.574
[scoffs] What, them?
They're doing great.

04:42.657 --> 04:46.787
[groans] I have to go again.
Stop at the next bush.

04:46.870 --> 04:49.498
Seriously? You just went ten bushes ago.

04:49.581 --> 04:52.000
No, no, we're not stopping now.

04:52.083 --> 04:53.627
Trust me, I know what's best

04:53.710 --> 04:56.171
and fun is just around the corner.

04:57.214 --> 04:58.965
[shrieking]

04:59.049 --> 05:00.926
Okay, a different corner.

05:02.803 --> 05:04.638
[everyone]
Are we there yet?

05:04.721 --> 05:05.639
No.

05:05.722 --> 05:08.225
[groans] Do you even know
where "there" is?

05:08.308 --> 05:09.976
Next question.

05:10.060 --> 05:11.102
Admit it.

05:11.186 --> 05:13.104
You don't know where
we're going, it's dark,

05:13.188 --> 05:15.357
and we don't even have a place to sleep!

05:15.440 --> 05:20.195
Sure we do.
We're gonna sleep right... there!

05:26.034 --> 05:28.286
[groans]
Why is the ground sticky?

05:28.370 --> 05:32.541
Uh, well, to help you stand better,
you know. Uh, but don't lick it.

05:32.624 --> 05:36.378
- [groaning]
- Ugh. This place smells like barf.

05:36.461 --> 05:41.258
[grunts] I wish. We should get some barf
to cover the smell.

05:41.341 --> 05:45.554
Come on, this place has everything.
Free meal...

05:45.637 --> 05:46.763
[groaning]

05:46.846 --> 05:47.973
Mmm.

05:48.056 --> 05:50.475
Indoor watering hole.

05:52.978 --> 05:53.812
[panting]

05:53.895 --> 05:55.272
Look. Sandy likes it.

05:57.816 --> 06:01.236
- [rumbling]
- And, uh, oh, look. Free massage.

06:03.780 --> 06:05.574
[whimpering]

06:07.117 --> 06:09.077
[growling]

06:09.160 --> 06:10.704
- [gasps]
- [gasps]

06:10.787 --> 06:13.707
Some massage.
I'm still all knots back there.

06:14.666 --> 06:15.959
[screams]

06:17.627 --> 06:20.922
Just wanna point out, that guy thought
the log was a fine place to stay.

06:21.006 --> 06:23.592
- Save it for if we survive.
- [panting]

06:23.675 --> 06:25.677
[hissing]

06:30.307 --> 06:34.811
So, this is how it ends.
And it's not my fault.

06:34.894 --> 06:36.938
Who saw that coming?

06:37.022 --> 06:40.900
Yeah, about that.
Family, I am sorry...

06:40.984 --> 06:42.319
[rumbling]

06:43.737 --> 06:45.447
[gagging]

06:49.534 --> 06:50.619
[sighing]

06:50.702 --> 06:54.247
Yes! See? Now, we didn't get eaten.

06:54.331 --> 06:55.749
Whoo! Yeah!

06:55.832 --> 06:58.752
[chuckles] Let's hear it, family. Huh?

06:58.835 --> 07:00.420
[grunts]

07:00.503 --> 07:03.923
Am I doing this high-five thing wrong?
Or, maybe it's this. Or...

07:04.007 --> 07:05.175
lower?

07:05.258 --> 07:07.302
Oh, you're doing something wrong.

07:07.385 --> 07:09.095
Uh, did anyone else
just hear a "shoomp"?

07:10.680 --> 07:13.892
Oh, hi. You must be
the people who saved us.

07:13.975 --> 07:15.977
Nice bonking, good form.

07:16.811 --> 07:21.483
Uh... we love what you've done
with your uh, menacing silhouettes.

07:21.566 --> 07:24.277
[chuckles]
Anyway, we're the Croods.

07:24.361 --> 07:28.823
We taste terrible and, uh, we'll be going
back to Ahhh! Valley.

07:28.907 --> 07:31.326
- [chuckles]
- Go? Why would you go?

07:31.409 --> 07:33.328
Oh, oh, my, did we...

07:33.411 --> 07:36.373
[gasps] Oh, we probably looked pretty
frightening just now.

07:36.456 --> 07:39.417
[chuckles] Did we make you think we were
gonna eat you folks or something?

07:39.501 --> 07:42.045
- 'Cause we're not.
- [grunting]

07:42.128 --> 07:44.547
[chuckles]

07:45.215 --> 07:47.968
We just came down to give you
a Brood family welcome.

07:48.051 --> 07:49.552
Would you like some welcome fruit?

07:49.636 --> 07:53.098
We don't see people here often,
so sometimes we forget how to act.

07:53.390 --> 07:56.434
- I'm Trixie. That's my husband, Dub.
- [grunts]

07:56.518 --> 07:59.020
He always gets excited
when we make new friends.

07:59.104 --> 08:02.565
- [grunts]
- And these are our kids Blurg and Frump.

08:02.649 --> 08:03.483
'Sup?

08:03.566 --> 08:06.069
You guys look nice, but weird.

08:08.655 --> 08:10.573
Now you look even weirder.

08:11.366 --> 08:12.534
You have a tail!

08:12.617 --> 08:15.787
Yep. It's like an arm for my butt.

08:15.870 --> 08:16.913
- Cool!
- Cool!

08:18.498 --> 08:20.333
[sighs, chuckles]

08:20.417 --> 08:24.337
And Dub's mom, Meema, is somewhere around
here, I don't know...

08:24.421 --> 08:26.089
Oh, strangers.

08:26.172 --> 08:28.341
Anyone need a hug?

08:28.425 --> 08:29.759
Aww...

08:29.843 --> 08:31.886
Look at that old thing.

08:31.970 --> 08:35.765
You call that bein' a grandma?
You disgust me.

08:35.849 --> 08:37.558
Enough of this love-in.

08:37.642 --> 08:41.563
In case nobody noticed,
we still got nowhere to sleep.

08:41.645 --> 08:42.856
You can stay here.

08:42.938 --> 08:45.191
There's plenty of space
and, like I said before,

08:45.275 --> 08:47.360
we have no plans to eat you.

08:47.444 --> 08:49.362
[chuckles]
Oh, thanks, but we're actually

08:49.446 --> 08:54.367
on a little getaway, as in,
we're trying to get away from people.

08:54.451 --> 08:57.287
- So I think we'll just...
- [snoring]

08:57.370 --> 08:59.748
sleep here, apparently.

09:04.210 --> 09:08.089
Wow, I think that was
the best sleep of my life!

09:08.173 --> 09:09.382
[screaming]

09:09.466 --> 09:10.759
[impact grunt]

09:10.842 --> 09:12.844
- [groaning]
- Morning!

09:12.927 --> 09:15.096
We moved you onto a branch for safety.

09:15.180 --> 09:17.640
Should we have told you that?
We should've, shouldn't we?

09:17.724 --> 09:19.100
Would've been nice.

09:20.894 --> 09:24.522
Well, I should catch my family breakfast,
so lay your rules on me.

09:24.606 --> 09:26.900
What can I hunt,
how much do I have to share?

09:26.983 --> 09:29.694
- Come on, every stupid rule.
- [chuckles]

09:29.778 --> 09:33.990
[chuckles] Excuse my husband's
hysterical laughter, but rules?

09:34.074 --> 09:38.078
Do whatever you want, Grug.
Nobody tells you what to do around here.

09:39.788 --> 09:43.333
You mean I can hunt a bunducky in my
underpelts and not share it?

09:43.416 --> 09:47.629
[chuckles] You could, but why would you
when you can do this?

09:48.588 --> 09:50.006
This?

09:52.509 --> 09:56.888
Instant food, and I get to hit something?
This is amazing!

09:57.555 --> 10:00.683
And there's plenty more
where that came from!

10:01.643 --> 10:02.643
[grunts]

10:10.318 --> 10:13.321
This place is paradise.
My family's gotta see this.

10:13.738 --> 10:14.738
[snoring]

10:14.781 --> 10:16.825
Croods, wake up!

10:16.908 --> 10:18.785
[screams]

10:18.868 --> 10:20.912
- [laughing]
- [groans]

10:20.995 --> 10:24.707
Dad, no more of this vacate-shun.

10:24.791 --> 10:26.918
It's time to go home.

10:27.001 --> 10:30.088
- [all] Yeah!
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

10:30.171 --> 10:32.507
You just got here.
Don't go running back to...

10:32.590 --> 10:35.093
where was it again?
Blah Valley?

10:35.176 --> 10:36.970
Yeah, we can't leave now.

10:37.053 --> 10:39.305
This vacate-shun is just getting good.

10:39.389 --> 10:41.224
[groans]

10:49.190 --> 10:51.734
[all]
Ahh!

10:51.818 --> 10:55.613
Okay, we'll stay one day,
but then it's right back to Ahhh! Valley.

10:56.281 --> 10:57.907
Only one day?

10:57.991 --> 11:01.119
Sounds like nothing can
change your family's minds.

11:01.202 --> 11:05.415
Not even the most fun day of their lives.

11:06.040 --> 11:07.041
Wink.

11:07.584 --> 11:11.504
That wink meant I actually
think we will change their minds.

11:11.588 --> 11:13.548
I wasn't supposed to
say that out loud, was I?

11:13.631 --> 11:15.633
It defeats the point of the wink,
doesn't it? Okay.

11:15.717 --> 11:18.970
Yeah, but... hey, looks like
Thunk's fitting in already.

11:22.140 --> 11:23.850
Don't stop.
Don't ever stop.

11:25.685 --> 11:27.896
So, what do you do for fun here?

11:27.979 --> 11:33.192
All sorts of great stuff.
We sit still, keep quiet, stay safe.

11:33.276 --> 11:34.319
Ugh, really?

11:34.402 --> 11:35.820
No.

11:35.904 --> 11:36.904
This.

11:36.946 --> 11:38.448
Wacky-sack!

11:39.032 --> 11:40.366
[squeals]

11:41.451 --> 11:45.705
Whoa! When I do that to Frump,
it always hits her in the face.

11:46.122 --> 11:47.457
[chuckles] I hear you.

11:47.540 --> 11:50.877
My brother is always getting hit
in the face with everything!

11:50.960 --> 11:53.171
Yeah. What's so cool about that is...

11:53.254 --> 11:54.756
race you to the top!

11:54.839 --> 11:56.341
[laughing]

12:01.512 --> 12:03.514
Oh, is that all you got?

12:06.017 --> 12:08.102
Whoa!

12:08.186 --> 12:10.688
[grunting]

12:15.193 --> 12:19.697
Oh, yeah. Another victory
for the victor, Eep.

12:19.781 --> 12:20.823
[laughs]

12:20.907 --> 12:22.450
[cheering]

12:25.578 --> 12:28.581
Oh, please.
You call that a victory dance?

12:28.665 --> 12:32.043
Check this out.
[cheering]

12:32.752 --> 12:36.047
You know what I always wanted? Wings.

12:36.130 --> 12:38.257
Me, too. Okay. On three.

12:38.341 --> 12:40.510
What's the first thing
you would do with wings?

12:40.593 --> 12:43.096
One, two, three.

12:43.179 --> 12:44.514
[both] Fly!

12:44.597 --> 12:46.182
And poop on the sun.

12:46.265 --> 12:47.642
Well, of course.

12:47.725 --> 12:48.643
Come on.

12:48.726 --> 12:50.144
I want you to meet my friends.

12:51.938 --> 12:52.938
[gasps]

12:52.981 --> 12:54.065
Ooh!

12:54.148 --> 12:55.942
Ooh!
[giggling]

12:57.986 --> 13:02.991
[gasps] It's like all at once,
every dream I ever had...

13:03.074 --> 13:05.743
Just kissed each other. I know.

13:07.912 --> 13:09.872
Whee!
[laughing]

13:09.956 --> 13:13.418
Too much cute. Going to...
[sighs]

13:17.213 --> 13:22.010
Isn't it wonderful
that our families get to be friends?

13:22.093 --> 13:26.514
No. Friends are like smiles.
A sign of weakness.

13:26.597 --> 13:32.937
Oh, well, I promise I'll be very quiet
then so I don't bother you.

13:33.021 --> 13:34.647
But I can still see you.

13:34.731 --> 13:36.691
Go hide behind that leaf.

13:37.817 --> 13:40.445
And stop breathin' so loud!

13:45.199 --> 13:46.367
Scratch that.

13:46.451 --> 13:49.912
Bring me a snack
and check my hair for bugs.

13:52.248 --> 13:56.711
Actually, we're gonna get along just fine.

13:56.794 --> 13:58.337
Oh, happy day.

13:58.421 --> 13:59.881
Shush it!

13:59.964 --> 14:02.508
Okay, so you put these
over your eyes and...

14:02.592 --> 14:06.596
Ah! I can feel the stress
being sucked out of me.

14:06.679 --> 14:09.307
That's the mud. It's full of parasites.

14:09.390 --> 14:12.185
Ooh, and have you ever
had your toenails treated?

14:14.979 --> 14:16.022
Ooh!

14:18.483 --> 14:21.736
Oh, I didn't even know
I still had a nail on that toe!

14:21.819 --> 14:23.488
[grunts]

14:23.571 --> 14:26.282
Dub, you took the grunt
right out of my mouth.

14:26.449 --> 14:27.283
Mm-hmm.

14:27.367 --> 14:30.453
Yeah, that's what I like about you.
Man of few words.

14:30.536 --> 14:34.374
Not like Snoot, this loudmouth
from Ahhh! Valley.

14:34.457 --> 14:37.210
He'd just talk and talk and talk.

14:37.293 --> 14:41.214
[gasps] That valley sounds awful.
Get it off your chest, Grug.

14:41.297 --> 14:43.716
Oh, don't get me started on Ahhh! Valley.

14:43.800 --> 14:46.719
First, there's my boss, One-Eyed Amber.

14:46.803 --> 14:50.640
She's always riding me on the hunting
fields no matter how much prey I catch.

14:50.723 --> 14:53.726
And you know, I think she only wears
that patch for one-eyed jokes.

14:53.810 --> 14:57.772
And then, there's the watering hole.
You want a drink on a hot day, forget it.

14:57.855 --> 14:59.524
The lines are around the rock.

14:59.607 --> 15:03.653
And Womp says he doesn't pee in it,
but the taste says otherwise.

15:03.736 --> 15:06.614
Wow! You had a lot to get off your...

15:06.697 --> 15:10.701
Oh, let me circle back to Snoot.
His hair, what is up with that?

15:10.785 --> 15:12.787
"I go to the smashfruit tree for a drink,

15:12.870 --> 15:15.248
not to hear about
your weird dreams, Munk."

15:15.331 --> 15:18.501
Oh yeah, and there's a guy named Munk.
I think that's it.

15:18.584 --> 15:22.588
Wow, Grug, watering holes, smashfruit
trees, plenty of prey.

15:22.672 --> 15:26.300
That valley sounds pretty great,
if it weren't for all the people.

15:26.384 --> 15:27.635
Ooh.

15:27.718 --> 15:30.972
- Baitsy. He's another pain in my...
- They get the picture.

15:31.055 --> 15:33.224
Well, point is,
you guys are doing it right.

15:33.307 --> 15:36.394
No people. Ahhh! Valley
has nothing on this place.

15:36.477 --> 15:39.105
You said it, Dad.
I love it here!

15:39.188 --> 15:45.111
- Yeah. I'm having the best day.
- [grunts] No, I'm having the best day.

15:45.194 --> 15:47.613
[laughing]

15:47.697 --> 15:51.033
Really? So you wanna stay another night?

15:51.117 --> 15:53.703
We wanna stay forever. Can we?

15:55.329 --> 15:56.329
[soft grunt]

15:56.914 --> 15:58.291
Oh, sorry.

15:58.374 --> 16:01.252
That's Dub's way of saying yes.
You can stay.

16:01.335 --> 16:03.463
[cheering]

16:03.546 --> 16:06.048
Guess you won't be needing that anymore.

16:06.132 --> 16:07.508
Yes. Finally.

16:07.592 --> 16:09.177
[groans]

16:09.260 --> 16:11.679
Oh, I meant your map.

16:11.762 --> 16:14.849
[chuckles]
Right. Sure. Uh, that, too.

16:14.932 --> 16:19.270
Get lost, map. The Croods have found
a new home.

16:23.941 --> 16:26.903
[sighs]
Hey, you guys got up early?

16:26.986 --> 16:29.113
Why didn't you wake me for breakfast?

16:29.197 --> 16:33.743
[chuckles] You snooze, you lose.
Or you would if you weren't in paradise.

16:34.619 --> 16:35.703
Okay.

16:38.164 --> 16:41.918
Mm. You know, food just tastes better
when you don't work for it.

16:42.001 --> 16:44.003
Thunk, do you want sevenths?

16:44.086 --> 16:45.838
- Huh?
- Mm-hmm.

16:48.090 --> 16:51.677
Huh? That's weird.

16:51.761 --> 16:54.055
Huh. It must be jammed.

16:54.138 --> 16:57.433
You know, as in, the fruit's turned
to jam and clogged up the trunk.

16:58.976 --> 17:01.020
Sandy,
get up there and see what's wrong.

17:01.103 --> 17:05.023
- [panting]
- No, Grug, it's dangerous. Eep, you go.

17:08.361 --> 17:10.863
[panting]
Huh. It's empty.

17:11.906 --> 17:14.032
[laughs]
There's one!

17:14.116 --> 17:16.035
That's the last of our fruit, Mom.

17:18.621 --> 17:21.123
Good thing we're on our way to more fruit.

17:21.207 --> 17:23.751
Isn't it fun to run away to a new home?

17:23.834 --> 17:26.628
It is. What do you kids wanna do first
when we get there?

17:27.213 --> 17:31.133
Squeeze all their animals
until they listen to me.

17:31.217 --> 17:32.718
Hunt people for sport.

17:32.802 --> 17:35.680
Though I hope they're more of
a challenge than Eep.

17:35.763 --> 17:38.224
I had to let her win.

17:38.307 --> 17:40.810
[groans] Let me win?

17:40.893 --> 17:42.353
I'll let you win...!

17:42.436 --> 17:45.523
I feel bad
leaving the Croods behind.

17:45.606 --> 17:48.109
Their meat could be delicious.

17:48.317 --> 17:49.860
[gasps]

17:49.944 --> 17:52.863
[impact grunts]
Oh!

17:52.947 --> 17:56.242
Nothing? Never send a girl
to do a baby's job.

17:56.325 --> 17:58.119
[grunts] The Broods!

17:58.202 --> 18:03.165
They're about to ditch us and this place
is out of food and Meema wants to eat us.

18:03.249 --> 18:04.750
Respectable.

18:04.834 --> 18:09.338
[groans] And Blurg claims she let me win,
when she clearly did not.

18:09.422 --> 18:10.798
Eep, slow down.

18:10.881 --> 18:13.718
Why would the Broods wanna leave?
And come on,

18:13.801 --> 18:15.678
there's plenty of food right...

18:15.761 --> 18:17.221
[grunting]

18:17.930 --> 18:19.932
[gasps]
It's a fake.

18:20.016 --> 18:23.436
Also, one of the Broods shows a lot of
promise as a cave painter.

18:23.519 --> 18:24.520
[all gasp]

18:25.229 --> 18:26.272
[Gran groans]

18:26.355 --> 18:29.609
[Gran] Those trees look
more gnarled and dead than I do!

18:29.692 --> 18:32.862
[gasps] Huh. It's...

18:32.945 --> 18:34.113
Huh.

18:34.196 --> 18:37.116
See? The Broods tricked us.

18:37.199 --> 18:40.369
Except Blurg, who did not let me win.

18:40.453 --> 18:42.288
There's something rotten about this.

18:42.371 --> 18:45.833
And not the good kind of rotten, either.
Maybe we should go.

18:46.917 --> 18:48.836
[grunting] Wait.

18:49.879 --> 18:52.923
There's gotta be more food.
I'm sure the Broods can explain.

18:53.007 --> 18:54.216
[grunts]

18:54.300 --> 18:58.179
Ugh, Dad.
I know you hate listening to people,

18:58.262 --> 19:00.806
but you really need to listen
to me right now.

19:00.890 --> 19:02.683
- Not listening!
- Dad, wait!

19:02.767 --> 19:04.560
- Grug, come on.
- Please, don't make me climb.

19:05.811 --> 19:06.854
Whoa!

19:06.937 --> 19:08.773
[grunting]

19:10.274 --> 19:11.525
See, Eep?

19:12.568 --> 19:13.819
They have plenty of food.

19:14.320 --> 19:19.033
In their arms, as they're
going off somewhere. Oh.

19:19.116 --> 19:22.370
Oh, this? Allow me
to clear things up right... hi-yah!

19:22.912 --> 19:24.914
Hey! You coulda hit me.

19:24.997 --> 19:26.624
Ooh, that was awkward.

19:26.707 --> 19:29.835
You're probably wondering why I tried
to bonk you on the head just now.

19:29.919 --> 19:31.837
Oh, we're wondering
a lot of things, Trixie,

19:31.921 --> 19:34.674
- like what are you doing with our map?
- [grunts]

19:34.757 --> 19:36.634
And where are you going
with all the food?

19:38.219 --> 19:41.180
And seriously,
why do you have tails?

19:41.889 --> 19:42.890
It's freaky.

19:42.973 --> 19:46.644
Hey, now, there's no need
to be rude, is there?

19:46.727 --> 19:49.146
Not yet, anyway.

20:01.242 --> 20:06.247
Frump, please tell me
that was the command for "snuggle pile."

20:06.330 --> 20:07.665
[growling]

20:12.086 --> 20:15.005
Hey, what gives?
Use your words, not your monkeys.

20:15.089 --> 20:18.300
We do whatever we want.
But it comes at a price.

20:18.384 --> 20:22.179
We've eaten every last
fruit, leaf and bug here.

20:22.263 --> 20:25.099
And rocks, too. There's one.

20:25.182 --> 20:27.768
Frump, really? We talked about this.

20:27.852 --> 20:31.605
Now that this land is used up,
we need a new place to take over.

20:31.689 --> 20:36.277
Thanks to you, we have one.
A Valley.

20:36.360 --> 20:39.697
A Valley? Oh, you mean Ahhh! Valley.

20:39.780 --> 20:42.366
[chuckles] We actually scream the...
wait, what?

20:42.950 --> 20:45.870
- Tell me it isn't so, Dub.
- [grunts]

20:45.953 --> 20:48.706
Wow. And I thought I knew you.

20:48.789 --> 20:52.084
You think we're gonna let you
destroy our home?

20:52.168 --> 20:53.711
Over our dead bodies!

20:53.794 --> 20:55.337
Yes, that's the plan.

20:55.421 --> 20:57.548
Was that not clear,
what with all the monkhuahuas?

20:57.631 --> 21:02.136
That we’re going to... well, "kill"
is such a harsh word, so... splat?

21:02.219 --> 21:05.181
Yes, we’re going to splat you.

21:06.849 --> 21:08.684
[squealing]

21:14.523 --> 21:17.526
This is all my fault.
I should've listened to you guys.

21:17.610 --> 21:20.529
Why didn't I listen to you?
Was it my pride or my...

21:20.613 --> 21:22.573
[gasps]
I've got an idea.

21:22.656 --> 21:24.325
Not now, Eep. Daddy's talking.

21:24.408 --> 21:25.910
We have to jump.

21:25.993 --> 21:28.662
What? That's crazy.
We'll die.

21:29.663 --> 21:30.498
Differently.

21:30.581 --> 21:31.457
Dad, listen.

21:31.540 --> 21:34.210
Do what I say, and we can
make it out of here alive.

21:37.713 --> 21:38.964
Mmm.

21:39.548 --> 21:44.178
Sorry, Broods. I'm afraid
you'll have to splat us another time.

21:47.223 --> 21:49.475
[screaming]

21:49.558 --> 21:51.393
So, this is how it ends.

21:51.477 --> 21:55.564
- Nice to have some closure on the topic.
- No. Everyone, grab these.

22:06.075 --> 22:07.618
Huh. You were right, Eep.

22:07.701 --> 22:09.620
We made it out of there
without a scratch.

22:09.703 --> 22:10.703
[grunting]

22:11.622 --> 22:13.332
Still...

22:16.836 --> 22:18.379
We gotta warn Ahhh! Valley.

22:18.462 --> 22:24.134
Yeah. If we fell for the Broods' lies,
those dingobats definitely will.

22:25.886 --> 22:28.222
We've got a good head start.
I think we can actually...

22:28.305 --> 22:31.559
[screaming]

22:31.642 --> 22:34.144
[overlapping dialogue]

22:36.188 --> 22:39.525
[Thunk] So, this is how it ends.
