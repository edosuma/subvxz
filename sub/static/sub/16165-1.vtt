01:04.194 --> 01:05.525
<i>Four turtles...</i>

01:07.130 --> 01:08.859
<i>... four brothers...</i>

01:11.467 --> 01:15.335
<i>... genetically reborn</i>
<i>in the sewers of New York.</i>

01:16.773 --> 01:20.800
<i>Named after the great</i>
<i>Renaissance masters...</i>

01:20.977 --> 01:23.741
<i>... and trained as ninjas.</i>

01:29.219 --> 01:33.713
<i>They battled many creatures and foes</i>
<i>before defeating their archenemy...</i>

01:34.290 --> 01:36.224
<i>... the Shredder.</i>

01:40.029 --> 01:45.126
<i>But now a greater evil is poised</i>
<i>to destroy their very brotherhood.</i>

01:45.301 --> 01:50.364
<i>An evil born 3000 years ago.</i>

01:58.314 --> 02:01.647
<i>It was in that time</i>
<i>that a warrior king named Yoatl...</i>

02:01.818 --> 02:06.846
<i>... led a brotherhood that fought</i>
<i>side by side with one purpose:</i>

02:08.524 --> 02:12.654
<i>To conquer all the kingdoms</i>
<i>of the world.</i>

02:17.200 --> 02:19.532
<i>Nothing could stand in their way...</i>

02:19.969 --> 02:24.269
<i>... as they left a trail of destruction</i>
<i>behind them.</i>

02:40.890 --> 02:43.859
<i>In his quest,</i>
<i>the warrior learned of a constellation...</i>

02:44.027 --> 02:46.552
<i>... known as the Stars of Kikan.</i>

02:46.729 --> 02:50.597
<i>Every 3000 years,</i>
<i>the stars would align...</i>

02:50.767 --> 02:55.500
<i>... opening a portal</i>
<i>to a world of unknown power.</i>

03:00.009 --> 03:01.636
<i>He became immortal...</i>

03:01.811 --> 03:04.041
<i>... but at a price.</i>

03:07.583 --> 03:11.576
<i>His brotherhood was turned to stone.</i>

03:12.188 --> 03:14.315
<i>And upon the portal's opening...</i>

03:14.490 --> 03:20.326
<i>... 13 monsters were released</i>
<i>into our world.</i>

03:47.790 --> 03:52.250
<i>The warrior king was left</i>
<i>to eternally walk the Earth...</i>

03:52.428 --> 03:58.663
<i>... unable to die</i>
<i>or forget his horrible mistake.</i>

04:07.176 --> 04:09.667
<i>And the monsters</i>
<i>that were unleashed...</i>

04:09.846 --> 04:15.375
<i>... continue to plague mankind</i>
<i>to this very day.</i>

04:40.810 --> 04:42.744
Monsters.

04:43.279 --> 04:44.337
No.

04:44.914 --> 04:47.439
We appreciate the generous donation...

04:47.617 --> 04:51.553
...for the continued protection
of your village.

04:52.955 --> 04:58.086
After all, the jungle
can be a very dangerous place.

04:59.796 --> 05:02.162
- Mama!
- Oh, she is dangerous.

05:02.331 --> 05:04.526
There's monsters out there.

05:27.156 --> 05:28.714
Watch where you're going.

05:28.891 --> 05:31.951
There's a log on the road, seÃ±or.

05:32.128 --> 05:35.689
Well, if you're not too busy, remove it.

05:52.115 --> 05:55.175
Who are you? Show yourself.

05:55.351 --> 05:59.549
The ghost of the jungle.
He punishes those who prey upon the weak.

05:59.722 --> 06:01.053
He's coming.

06:03.926 --> 06:06.656
I just remembered I left the stove on.
My wife hates that.

06:06.829 --> 06:10.424
- Coward. Get back here.
- You're on your own, <i>jefe.</i>

06:10.600 --> 06:14.696
Show yourself.
Do you realize who you're dealing with?

06:21.077 --> 06:22.408
What is this...? What?

06:34.724 --> 06:37.352
I am not afraid of a myth.

06:37.560 --> 06:40.586
I'm not afraid of a ghost.

06:46.102 --> 06:48.070
What are you?

07:05.354 --> 07:07.618
It's a miracle.

07:16.899 --> 07:20.096
The ghost of the jungle.

07:23.940 --> 07:26.500
There. That's where I saw him.

07:28.277 --> 07:29.801
Thank you.

07:30.112 --> 07:32.080
You'd better get home now.

07:32.248 --> 07:34.512
Do you know the ghost?

07:34.884 --> 07:37.352
He wasn't always a ghost.

08:00.943 --> 08:02.638
Hello?

08:08.017 --> 08:10.383
Is anyone here?

08:12.188 --> 08:14.179
Hello?

08:20.997 --> 08:24.023
It's a long way from the city
to just drop in.

08:26.902 --> 08:28.563
Leo.

08:31.540 --> 08:34.008
You came all the way down here
to look for me?

08:34.176 --> 08:36.167
Actually, I was already here
on business.

08:36.345 --> 08:38.836
But then the local legend
started sounding familiar...

08:39.015 --> 08:40.505
...so I decided to snoop around.

08:40.683 --> 08:43.674
- What kind of business?
- Ancient artifacts.

08:43.852 --> 08:46.151
Some tycoon with too much time
on his hands...

08:46.322 --> 08:49.655
...has his heart set on a collection
of 3000-year-old statues.

08:49.825 --> 08:52.885
Well, you always did run
with a strange crowd, April.

08:53.062 --> 08:57.624
Yeah, well. Our strange crowd
hasn't been the same without you.

08:59.001 --> 09:01.765
Things aren't looking so good
back home.

09:02.471 --> 09:04.268
How bad could it be?

09:04.440 --> 09:07.102
Donnie's probably got everything
under control.

09:07.276 --> 09:08.607
Sir? Sir. Sir.

09:10.112 --> 09:13.240
Did you turn the computer on?
Have you plugged it in?

09:13.416 --> 09:14.610
Yeah, that would help.

09:14.784 --> 09:16.376
No, I'm not playing hard to get.

09:16.552 --> 09:19.214
I'm telling you, sir,
it's not that kind of phone line.

09:19.388 --> 09:22.949
I'm not your enemy. I'm just Donnie,
your friendly IT tech support...

09:23.125 --> 09:25.093
...here to help you 24 hours a day, sir.

09:25.628 --> 09:27.994
Yeah, I'm sorry. Ma'am.

09:28.864 --> 09:33.324
But Donnie's a genius.
Why would he take a job like that?

09:33.502 --> 09:34.867
At least he's keeping busy.

09:35.037 --> 09:38.097
Well, if he's doing that,
who's keeping an eye on Mikey?

09:38.274 --> 09:43.177
<i>Mike's gotten into</i>
<i>the entertainment business.</i>

09:44.647 --> 09:45.636
Yeah.

09:45.815 --> 09:50.013
Happy birthday from Cowabunga Carl.

09:52.388 --> 09:55.221
Take it easy, little dudes.
I bruise easily.

09:55.391 --> 09:58.724
Hey, black-and-blue clashes with green,
dudes. Hey, that's...

09:58.894 --> 10:00.293
He's a big hit.

10:00.463 --> 10:03.796
All right. Let's hear it.
What's Raph doing?

10:03.966 --> 10:07.993
No one really knows.
He just sleeps all day.

10:08.170 --> 10:10.161
Well, what's he do all night?

10:23.152 --> 10:27.782
<i>2802, 2802, burglary in progress</i>
<i>at 55th and Broadway.</i>

10:27.957 --> 10:30.357
<i>Suspects considered</i>
<i>armed and dangerous.</i>

10:30.726 --> 10:32.921
Time to punch in.

10:51.213 --> 10:54.239
Good work, boys. That was easier
than I thought it was gonna be.

10:54.417 --> 10:57.250
Hey, look, guys. I grabbed a toaster.

10:57.420 --> 11:01.789
I love your work ethic, Tommy.
It's an inspiration to us all.

11:10.433 --> 11:11.923
What was that?

11:12.134 --> 11:14.364
What's going on, guys?

11:15.504 --> 11:16.971
What in the...?

11:23.946 --> 11:26.847
Looks like it's just you and me, shaky.

11:27.583 --> 11:31.644
Take it easy. I'm not gonna hurt you...

11:32.121 --> 11:33.349
...much.

11:45.000 --> 11:46.934
I love when they play hard to get.

11:56.479 --> 11:58.606
The Nightwatcher.

11:59.215 --> 12:01.149
- He's doing our job for us again.
- Tommy.

12:01.317 --> 12:03.979
- Keep your hands to yourself.
- Hey, who's tickling me?

12:05.554 --> 12:08.079
Your training period ended a year ago.

12:08.257 --> 12:10.725
And Splinter says
you don't write anymore.

12:10.893 --> 12:13.555
Splinter sent me down here
to become a better leader.

12:13.729 --> 12:16.061
I can't go back a failure.

12:16.232 --> 12:20.134
Besides, these people need me
more than my brothers do.

12:20.436 --> 12:22.097
If Master Splinter were here...

12:22.271 --> 12:24.967
...he would ask you,
"What is your heart telling you?"

12:25.140 --> 12:29.474
I don't know.
I just know something's missing.

12:30.379 --> 12:33.314
Your brothers need you, Leo.

12:33.916 --> 12:36.146
They're lost without you.

12:38.687 --> 12:40.587
Leo?

13:22.097 --> 13:25.863
Why skate a halfpipe
when you can skate a sewer pipe?

13:35.744 --> 13:38.474
Sewer's up, bra.

13:42.585 --> 13:44.177
Hey.

13:53.729 --> 13:55.458
Cowabunga.

14:04.139 --> 14:06.573
Dude. Going down.

14:08.110 --> 14:09.907
Yeah.

14:19.188 --> 14:22.453
Here's Mikey.

14:23.726 --> 14:25.216
Guys?

14:25.394 --> 14:27.055
Anyone?

14:27.663 --> 14:29.494
Hello?

14:30.232 --> 14:31.722
Whatever.

14:32.067 --> 14:34.763
This place used to be fun.

14:36.438 --> 14:39.839
<i>And with rocketing interest rates,</i>
<i>that's bad news for homeowners...</i>

14:40.009 --> 14:43.877
<i>... as the real-estate market</i>
<i>continues its downward spiral.</i>

14:44.546 --> 14:47.344
<i>Coming up, the vigilante known</i>
<i>as Nightwatcher strikes again.</i>

14:48.684 --> 14:51.744
<i>Now, I can't say for sure,</i>
<i>but he was definitely an alien.</i>

14:51.920 --> 14:55.287
<i>I think it's a disgrace, taking the law</i>
<i>into your own hands like that.</i>

14:55.457 --> 14:58.187
<i>- Leave it to the police.</i>
<i>- Up next...</i>

14:58.360 --> 15:02.228
I remember how that used to feel,
busting up crime syndicates.

15:02.398 --> 15:06.698
Sure, they had a bunch of guns,
but they weren't like these guns.

15:06.869 --> 15:10.305
Why do you do this to yourself, Mikey?
Those glory days are over.

15:10.472 --> 15:14.306
Forget about them. Get on with your life.
Concentrate on your work.

15:14.476 --> 15:17.502
Yeah, yeah. Spoken like a true has-been.

15:18.580 --> 15:20.275
Well, look who woke up.

15:20.449 --> 15:23.646
I suppose you think the Nightwatcher
is some kind of hero.

15:24.486 --> 15:27.614
Beats sitting around doing nothing
while dirtbags run free.

15:27.790 --> 15:30.725
I would love to know what it is
that you do that's so great.

15:30.893 --> 15:33.555
We're contributing around here.
All you do is sleep.

15:33.729 --> 15:37.927
Yeah, I do nothing. You're right.
You got me all figured out.

15:38.100 --> 15:41.592
I know that your attitude has been
a source of contention to this team.

15:41.770 --> 15:44.432
You think fear is the best way
to accomplish things.

15:44.606 --> 15:47.905
First of all, this team you speak of
doesn't exist anymore.

15:48.077 --> 15:49.704
And second of all...

15:49.878 --> 15:51.311
Raphael.

15:54.683 --> 15:56.150
Enough.

15:56.952 --> 15:58.283
I think I made my point.

15:58.454 --> 16:00.581
That doesn't prove anything.

16:03.592 --> 16:05.992
Why couldn't you send him away
for training?

16:06.161 --> 16:10.063
Donatello, this home
has become like an empty shell.

16:10.232 --> 16:13.827
Each of your brothers
has strengths and weaknesses.

16:14.002 --> 16:17.130
You must learn to be strong
when they are weak.

16:17.306 --> 16:19.968
If you don't learn to recognize this...

16:20.142 --> 16:24.238
...then all hope is lost for our family.

16:40.462 --> 16:42.327
Keep it coming.

16:49.605 --> 16:51.004
Hey, careful.

16:51.173 --> 16:52.800
Those aren't souvenirs.

16:53.308 --> 16:55.799
Sorry about that, ma'am.

16:59.047 --> 17:00.810
Where are you, Casey?

17:02.384 --> 17:05.251
Come on. Come on, pick up.

17:05.854 --> 17:08.049
Don't do this to me again. Not now.

17:08.223 --> 17:12.489
<i>Casey can't come to the phone right now</i>
<i>because we're hardly working.</i>

17:14.997 --> 17:16.487
This better be good.

17:16.665 --> 17:22.103
<i>Casey, I am standing on the dock with</i>
<i>a priceless statue and no delivery truck.</i>

17:22.271 --> 17:26.002
<i>- So my question is, where are you?</i>
- April.

17:26.175 --> 17:29.542
<i>Hey, babe. I am so sorry.</i>
<i>I set the alarm clock, but...</i>

17:32.347 --> 17:35.316
It's broken. The clock...

17:37.286 --> 17:40.278
It's bad enough that you're
out every night playing vigilante...

17:40.455 --> 17:43.788
...but we've got a deadline to meet.
<i>- I'm sorry.</i>

17:43.959 --> 17:47.395
Oh, wait, babe, real quick.
You left a message saying you found Leo.

17:47.563 --> 17:50.555
- I mean, is he there with you?
<i>- No.</i>

17:50.732 --> 17:53.758
I found him. He's not coming back.

17:55.003 --> 17:58.769
But didn't you tell him how weird things
have gotten with the Turtles?

17:58.941 --> 18:01.774
<i>Look, Casey, we're gonna lose</i>
<i>the biggest client we have...</i>

18:01.944 --> 18:03.741
<i>... if you don't get down here.</i>

18:03.912 --> 18:06.881
All right. I'm on my way.

18:13.822 --> 18:16.552
Please tell me we're getting paid
by the pound here.

18:17.159 --> 18:18.990
Is this place a museum or what?

18:19.161 --> 18:22.187
- You've never heard of Winterscorp?
- That's what I'm telling you.

18:22.364 --> 18:26.528
They're into everything: Real estate,
technology, pharmaceuticals, hair gel.

18:26.702 --> 18:28.727
- I don't wear hair gel.
- Really?

18:28.904 --> 18:32.237
I'm the caveman type, au naturel.

18:32.407 --> 18:34.841
Just make sure you don't
touch anything in here.

18:35.010 --> 18:37.740
Hey, I was born careful.

18:39.448 --> 18:41.279
Hope that wasn't expensive.

18:41.817 --> 18:45.253
Oh, wait... Just... I'm...

18:45.420 --> 18:48.912
- Oh, boy.
- Please tell me that wasn't you.

18:59.735 --> 19:02.727
- Mr. Winters.
- Miss O'Neil.

19:03.338 --> 19:05.465
All the pieces are coming together.

19:05.641 --> 19:08.872
Oh, my. This is my associate, Casey.

19:09.044 --> 19:11.376
- Nice to meet you, Kenny.
- Boyfriend. It's Casey.

19:11.546 --> 19:14.208
- So you were successful?
- Yes. The fourth general.

19:14.383 --> 19:16.112
I want to ask you before I go...

19:16.285 --> 19:19.743
...if I could take one last look?

19:30.899 --> 19:33.333
I believe this is the one
they call General Akeela?

19:33.502 --> 19:37.370
It's actually "Aguila,"
but that was a good try.

19:39.141 --> 19:42.235
These statues may appear
to be only stone...

19:42.411 --> 19:46.404
...but they're like family to me.
I didn't choose them.

19:46.581 --> 19:50.312
Friends you can choose,
but never your family.

19:50.519 --> 19:52.384
Okay, then.

19:54.022 --> 19:56.684
Take care, Mr. Winters.

20:03.966 --> 20:06.491
If you've come to kill me,
could you make it fast?

20:06.668 --> 20:10.536
I've got a shareholders' meeting at 10.
I'd rather miss it.

20:13.475 --> 20:17.878
If we had come here to hurt you,
you'd be hurting already.

20:18.046 --> 20:21.277
The Foot Clan and I
have come to hear your offer.

20:21.450 --> 20:25.318
Well, it appears that today
is my lucky day.

20:25.921 --> 20:28.412
I must warn you,
we do not come cheap.

20:28.590 --> 20:31.115
Does it look like
money is of any concern to me?

20:31.293 --> 20:34.262
Only time is of the essence, my dear.

20:34.863 --> 20:36.694
Since you're so rich and powerful...

20:36.865 --> 20:39.800
...what is it we could possibly have
to offer you?

20:39.968 --> 20:41.993
I need you to be my eyes and ears.

20:42.170 --> 20:44.400
I have some friends coming to town...

20:44.573 --> 20:47.701
...that I'd like to roll out
the red carpet for.

20:48.944 --> 20:52.812
Greet them warmly
and bring them to me.

20:53.615 --> 20:56.345
And how will we know these friends?

20:56.518 --> 21:00.716
Don't worry, they're impossible to miss.

21:27.749 --> 21:29.580
And you keep them up. Got that?

21:29.851 --> 21:32.513
And don't let me catch you
calling the cops.

21:32.687 --> 21:34.314
What? Not again.

21:39.261 --> 21:41.991
Didn't I take care of you last week?

21:42.164 --> 21:45.895
Hey. Oh, no. Come on, now. Wait.

21:46.068 --> 21:49.196
I'm very disappointed in you,
knucklehead.

21:49.371 --> 21:51.635
Guess night school's in session.

21:51.807 --> 21:53.866
Hope I'm not disturbing class.

21:54.042 --> 21:56.636
Hey, Nightwatcher,
need any teaching assistants?

21:56.812 --> 21:58.780
Oh, no. Casey.

21:58.947 --> 22:02.815
I got this one covered, pal.
Thanks, but no, thanks.

22:02.984 --> 22:08.081
You think you own these rooftops?
I happen to think you could use my help.

22:08.690 --> 22:10.123
And I could use a sidekick.

22:10.292 --> 22:13.420
You may have everyone else fooled,
but you haven't fooled me, Raph.

22:13.595 --> 22:16.257
Yeah, well, guess what, pal.
Now you...

22:16.431 --> 22:19.730
Hey, wait a minute.
How did you know it was me?

22:20.569 --> 22:24.061
Wasn't that hard, man.
You know, you look like a big, metal turtle.

22:25.340 --> 22:27.365
It's that obvious, huh?

22:28.477 --> 22:32.971
- I should've stayed in law school.
- Ain't that cute? He's trying to get away.

22:37.085 --> 22:38.882
Well, looks like I got a sidekick.

22:39.054 --> 22:42.353
Yeah, right. You're the sidekick.

22:45.427 --> 22:50.126
- What, is it performance art? I don't get it.
- What was I supposed to do...

22:50.298 --> 22:53.062
...sit around, wait for Leo to come back
and save the day?

22:53.235 --> 22:55.328
I mean, we haven't
heard word one from him...

22:55.504 --> 22:58.337
...since Splinter sent him away
on his little vacation.

22:58.507 --> 23:01.908
You think these lowlifes take vacations
at the first sign of pressure?

23:02.077 --> 23:05.979
No. The criminal element of this city
may be guilty of a lot of things...

23:06.148 --> 23:08.480
...but being quitters ain't one of them.

23:09.284 --> 23:11.616
You know, I don't even care
about Leo anymore.

23:11.786 --> 23:13.447
Kind of hope he never comes back.

23:13.622 --> 23:16.455
Come on, aren't you being
a little hard on the guy?

23:16.625 --> 23:18.354
I don't know. It's possible.

23:18.527 --> 23:21.553
I guess if I could live anywhere
other than the city, I'd go too.

23:21.730 --> 23:23.891
But I could never leave this place.

23:24.065 --> 23:28.195
I can't even sleep without the sound
of the subway rumbling over my head.

23:28.370 --> 23:31.430
I guess it comes from growing up
with a houseful of brothers.

23:32.107 --> 23:33.938
I'm not trying to tell you what to do.

23:34.109 --> 23:38.102
I'm just saying that if it was my brother,
I'd find a way to work it out.

23:38.280 --> 23:39.907
But that's just me.

23:40.081 --> 23:43.073
I got my own issues, you know?
Like back at home, with April.

23:43.251 --> 23:45.651
There's this whole thing
about settling down...

23:45.820 --> 23:47.879
...that makes me miss the old times.

23:48.056 --> 23:51.457
I don't know if I can be the grownup
she needs me to be.

23:56.331 --> 23:58.162
Good talk, Raph.

24:23.358 --> 24:26.987
Arise, my brothers. Arise, dear sister.

24:27.162 --> 24:29.187
The Stars of Kikan align.

24:29.364 --> 24:34.097
All ye generals,
wake from your stone slumber.

25:21.249 --> 25:23.444
Dude.

25:25.153 --> 25:27.246
Dude.

25:47.542 --> 25:49.373
Enter.

25:50.211 --> 25:52.736
Kneel, my son.

25:58.086 --> 26:01.055
I return from my training, master.

26:01.222 --> 26:06.387
I was so caught up in my own world,
I forgot about everyone else.

26:07.796 --> 26:10.356
I'm sorry I failed.

26:12.300 --> 26:15.167
On the contrary, my son...

26:18.506 --> 26:21.304
...now you are much stronger.

26:30.618 --> 26:33.086
Your strength is needed here now.

26:33.254 --> 26:39.124
You owe me no apology,
but perhaps you should talk to Raphael.

26:39.294 --> 26:43.594
Your absence has been
particularly difficult for him...

26:44.065 --> 26:46.465
...though he'll never admit it.

26:46.634 --> 26:49.967
I'm certain things will be back to normal
in no time, master.

26:50.572 --> 26:56.636
Good. Because until you can act as one,
you are forbidden to fight.

26:57.078 --> 26:59.046
Yes, sensei.

27:00.181 --> 27:02.979
I have missed you, Leonardo.

27:03.151 --> 27:05.745
I've missed you too, Father.

27:06.921 --> 27:08.320
Raphael.

27:08.490 --> 27:11.425
Your brother is home.

27:15.430 --> 27:18.365
- Hey.
- Hey.

27:20.101 --> 27:21.864
Welcome home.

27:22.036 --> 27:23.970
Yeah. Thanks.

27:24.139 --> 27:28.269
Well, I'm going to bed.

27:30.779 --> 27:34.271
Hey, Leo's back.
Better go say hello before he leaves again.

27:34.449 --> 27:37.077
- What? Leo.
- Hey.

27:37.252 --> 27:39.482
- Hey.
- Huh, Leo?

27:39.654 --> 27:42.054
- Is that really you?
- Yeah.

27:42.223 --> 27:46.421
- I'm, like, dreaming, aren't I?
- No, Mikey, you're not dreaming.

27:46.594 --> 27:51.031
Oh, good.
I have nightmares about birthday parties.

27:54.202 --> 27:57.137
Okay, Leo, I'll bite.
What are we doing up here?

27:57.305 --> 28:00.365
I told Splinter
I'd get this team in shape again.

28:00.542 --> 28:05.377
Hey, I've been training. Since you left,
my video-game scores have, like, doubled.

28:05.547 --> 28:08.209
Right, and while you've been
playing games, brother...

28:08.383 --> 28:10.544
...Nightwatcher's
come into the neighborhood...

28:10.718 --> 28:13.710
...like some kind of vigilante showboat.
But his days are done.

28:13.888 --> 28:15.719
Hey, you went AWOL, Leo...

28:15.890 --> 28:19.018
...and the Nightwatcher
was the only guy to pick up the slack.

28:19.194 --> 28:22.220
Crime never took a break. You did.

28:22.397 --> 28:26.231
I heard his bike turns into a plane or,
like, a jetpack.

28:26.401 --> 28:29.461
Hey, Don, you're so smart,
why don't we have jetpacks?

28:29.637 --> 28:32.800
That's good, Mikey. I don't even
trust you with a driver's license.

28:32.974 --> 28:35.534
Have you seen
the way this guy behaves...

28:40.114 --> 28:42.105
Someone's cranky.

28:45.587 --> 28:48.181
- Okay, jungle boy. Grab a vine.
- Raph, wait.

28:48.356 --> 28:50.017
Splinter told us not to fight.

28:50.191 --> 28:53.183
"Jungle boy." Good one.

28:55.830 --> 28:58.526
All right. But remember,
we're only up here for training.

28:58.700 --> 29:01.669
You know what I always say,
"Train by doing, dude."

29:01.836 --> 29:04.396
Mikey, when have you ever said that?

29:05.540 --> 29:07.872
You smell that?
It's like a monkey cage up here.

29:11.212 --> 29:13.703
Wow, good news is,
there's a bunch of Foot ninjas...

29:13.882 --> 29:16.214
...getting the snot kicked out of them.

29:21.122 --> 29:24.216
Bad news is, this thing
is gonna run out of bodies soon.

29:24.392 --> 29:27.361
Yeah, so?
You think we should help these guys?

29:27.529 --> 29:30.930
I'd rather enjoy the show.
What do you say, fearless leader?

29:31.099 --> 29:32.896
- We're not...
- I say we stop talking.

29:40.708 --> 29:42.300
Come here, fuzzy wuzzy.

29:43.511 --> 29:44.842
You.

29:46.381 --> 29:50.374
I think we're getting off
on the wrong foot here.

29:51.853 --> 29:54.720
- We're trying to help you.
- Never.

29:56.724 --> 29:58.157
Team.

30:00.695 --> 30:03.493
Wait, the Shredder's dead.

30:04.098 --> 30:07.067
Who are you working for?

30:11.406 --> 30:14.000
Hey, a little help, O fearless one.

30:17.378 --> 30:20.347
That was too easy.

30:20.515 --> 30:22.540
Like I said, too easy.

30:25.820 --> 30:27.310
Bad dog.

30:32.427 --> 30:34.292
Look at me. Found the elevator.

30:36.664 --> 30:39.189
Oh, my shoulder.

30:39.367 --> 30:41.130
My spleen.

30:54.482 --> 30:56.074
This place needed a skylight.

31:01.723 --> 31:03.748
This is why we need jetpacks.

31:03.925 --> 31:07.554
- Okay, any more bright ideas?
- How about this?

31:11.766 --> 31:15.463
When this is over,
I'm totally calling the architect.

31:55.243 --> 32:00.112
Wait a minute. How did something
that big just disappear? It doesn't...

32:00.815 --> 32:02.783
Dude, it's the cops.

32:06.754 --> 32:09.314
Raph. Raph!

32:16.197 --> 32:20.395
Oh, yeah. The turtles are back, dudes.

32:20.568 --> 32:24.504
I give us a 10 for style,
an eight for skill...

32:24.672 --> 32:27.937
...and a two for stealth.

32:36.084 --> 32:38.609
What seems to be the problem?

32:38.786 --> 32:42.313
The problem is that we were hired
to merely patrol the city...

32:42.490 --> 32:44.958
...and report anything strange to you.

32:45.326 --> 32:49.786
You never said anything about monsters.

32:51.899 --> 32:57.895
Now, I'm sorry that your illustrious group
have been reduced to hired guns...

32:58.072 --> 33:01.838
...but I believe we made a deal, Karai.

33:02.009 --> 33:04.204
And I expect you to honor it.

33:04.812 --> 33:09.340
You do understand honor, don't you?

33:11.719 --> 33:14.711
So how did we fare?

33:18.593 --> 33:23.724
My, my, my. And what is your name?

33:26.634 --> 33:29.000
Were there any problems, general?

33:29.170 --> 33:31.161
None, my lord.

33:31.339 --> 33:34.638
Then show these fools
how a true warrior acts.

33:34.809 --> 33:37.004
Keep them on schedule
in completing their task.

33:37.178 --> 33:38.839
We do not need any help.

33:39.013 --> 33:43.507
Nevertheless, Karai,
I trust my family more than I trust you.

33:43.684 --> 33:47.677
You may be the eyes and ears,
but they are the muscle.

33:47.855 --> 33:51.018
They will help you gather
the remaining 12 of these abominations...

33:51.192 --> 33:54.525
...so we can finally see
our birthrights fulfilled.

33:56.030 --> 33:58.021
It's going to be quite a party.

34:03.504 --> 34:07.634
Dudes, did anyone get the license plate
of that thing that hit us last night?

34:07.809 --> 34:09.139
My head.

34:09.310 --> 34:13.507
Okay, that was just weird. I mean,
first the Foot, then that hideous monster.

34:13.681 --> 34:17.708
Yeah. It looked like your mom, dude.

34:17.885 --> 34:21.480
Yeah, that would make her
your mom too, doofus.

34:21.656 --> 34:23.179
Yeah, whatever.

34:23.357 --> 34:25.688
Keep laughing.
Last night was an embarrassment.

34:25.860 --> 34:29.125
I'll tell you what's embarrassing.
You can't follow a single order.

34:29.297 --> 34:32.266
Oh, how cute.
You've been back for five minutes...

34:32.433 --> 34:35.094
...and now you're schooling us
on your master plan?

34:35.268 --> 34:37.362
Okay, so this is my fault now,
huh, Raph?

34:37.538 --> 34:39.802
I'm the only one
that has to be responsible?

34:39.974 --> 34:41.908
Hey, you're the trained master, not me.

34:42.076 --> 34:44.373
Dudes, can it. Here comes Splinter.

34:53.286 --> 34:55.050
Good morning, my sons.

34:55.223 --> 34:57.214
- Good morning, sensei.
- Sup?

35:01.896 --> 35:05.457
Every ninja's day should start
with a healthy breakfast.

35:05.633 --> 35:10.400
It fills me with pride
to see you boys together again.

35:10.571 --> 35:14.564
If anyone needs me,
I'll be watching my stories.

35:15.610 --> 35:18.636
- Hothead.
- Splinter Jr.

35:19.513 --> 35:23.347
Cody is going to break up with Donna.
I just know it.

35:23.517 --> 35:26.816
<i>We interrupt the</i> Gilmore Girls
<i>for this special news report.</i>

35:26.988 --> 35:28.580
<i>Monsters loose in the city?</i>

35:28.756 --> 35:31.156
<i>Strange reports are coming in</i>
<i>about an incident...</i>

35:31.325 --> 35:33.759
<i>... that sounds like something</i>
<i>out of science fiction.</i>

35:33.928 --> 35:35.589
Boys!

35:37.198 --> 35:40.964
Leonardo,
I am most disappointed in you.

35:41.135 --> 35:43.330
You are the eldest of your brothers.

35:43.771 --> 35:48.708
I was counting on you to bring order
to the chaos of this family.

35:48.876 --> 35:52.903
This is why I have forbidden
any surface activity.

35:53.080 --> 35:55.947
We cannot return to the surface
to fight evil...

35:56.117 --> 35:58.585
...if we continue to fight each other.

35:58.753 --> 36:01.347
But Master Splinter,
how can I be expected to do so...

36:01.522 --> 36:05.515
There are no excuses
when you are the leader, my student.

36:09.563 --> 36:12.054
We have to go out
and find who's responsible for this.

36:12.233 --> 36:13.632
There ain't no other solution.

36:13.801 --> 36:16.793
Save the brute-vigilante junk
for that Nightwatchman.

36:16.971 --> 36:18.302
- Nightwatcher.
- Nightwatcher.

36:18.472 --> 36:20.372
Yeah, whatever.

36:20.541 --> 36:22.441
I'm going out.

38:22.463 --> 38:24.624
<i>Witnesses say</i>
<i>there are holes in the floors...</i>

38:24.799 --> 38:28.895
<i>... as if something or someone had just</i>
<i>blasted straight down through them...</i>

38:29.070 --> 38:31.937
<i>... leaving authorities</i>
<i>scratching their heads.</i>

38:33.441 --> 38:36.103
Well, at least some people
care about justice these days.

38:36.277 --> 38:38.211
Hey, Casey.

38:38.679 --> 38:40.704
- Raph?
- Meet me on the roof, okay?

38:40.881 --> 38:42.473
What is it?

38:42.650 --> 38:45.517
The roof.
You know what the roof is, don't you?

38:45.686 --> 38:47.176
Pushy sidekick.

38:47.354 --> 38:49.982
<i>We've gotten this image</i>
<i>in from an amateur cameraman...</i>

38:50.157 --> 38:52.148
<i>... and I do stress "amateur."</i>

38:54.228 --> 38:56.822
Casey, come look at this.

39:01.535 --> 39:03.366
Be safe.

39:06.674 --> 39:08.073
What's this all about, Raph?

39:08.242 --> 39:10.710
We got bigger things to worry about
than criminals.

39:10.878 --> 39:12.402
Like what?

39:16.617 --> 39:18.107
Come on.

39:35.536 --> 39:36.867
I think we lost it.

39:37.037 --> 39:39.631
It's gotta be around here somewhere.

39:40.007 --> 39:41.872
I don't think so.

39:51.218 --> 39:52.344
What's going on, Raph?

39:52.520 --> 39:54.647
Did I mention
we ran into a monster last night?

39:54.822 --> 39:58.622
No, you kind of failed to tell me
about that one, buddy.

39:59.860 --> 40:02.420
You do know I only have
a wooden bat, don't you?

40:08.536 --> 40:11.562
The Foot? I thought they were history.

40:20.214 --> 40:23.149
And now we got walking statues?
You got a plan for those?

40:23.317 --> 40:25.945
Yeah. Hey, those are a first for me too.

40:26.353 --> 40:28.719
And who knows?
These guys might be friendly.

40:34.762 --> 40:36.252
Friendly.

40:43.804 --> 40:46.637
Wait a second. Those statues look...

40:55.182 --> 40:56.843
Witnesses.

40:58.519 --> 40:59.918
Watch out.

41:03.090 --> 41:05.081
I don't feel so good.

41:10.231 --> 41:11.926
That can't be good.

41:15.135 --> 41:16.966
That's just rude.

41:19.873 --> 41:21.636
Hey, wait up.

41:23.043 --> 41:24.601
- Raph?
- Come here.

41:24.778 --> 41:27.872
- What, you never heard of smoke pellets?
- Warn me next time.

41:28.048 --> 41:29.379
I got allergies.

41:31.585 --> 41:34.179
Come on.
That's the second mask this week.

41:36.156 --> 41:37.646
They'll never find us in here.

41:38.892 --> 41:42.350
Stay with me, now.
We'll be out of here soon.

41:49.036 --> 41:50.367
No.

41:51.238 --> 41:54.139
And I thought Girl Scouts were pushy.

41:58.279 --> 42:01.180
Some people just can't take a hint.

42:01.348 --> 42:06.877
<i>This is the police. You on the roof,</i>
<i>put your hands behind your...</i>

42:07.688 --> 42:10.384
<i>What is that? Tommy, you see this?</i>

42:13.527 --> 42:15.256
Yeah, you better run.

42:18.065 --> 42:19.760
I gotta hand it to you, Raph...

42:19.933 --> 42:22.663
...you sure know how
to show a lady a good time.

42:23.203 --> 42:24.727
Raph?

42:26.373 --> 42:30.571
Oh, no.
I gotta get you someplace safe, pal.

42:34.348 --> 42:37.181
My compliments to the chef.

42:42.790 --> 42:44.189
Anyone for dessert?

42:44.358 --> 42:45.791
- No.
- Yes.

42:45.959 --> 42:48.587
Cowabunga Carl Party Services.
Cowabunga, dude.

42:48.762 --> 42:52.027
<i>- Raph's hurt. You need to get over here.</i>
- Slow down, April.

42:52.199 --> 42:55.225
- What happened to Raph?
<i>- I don't know. He's unconscious.</i>

42:55.402 --> 42:57.199
We'll be right there.

43:05.879 --> 43:08.040
Leo. You came back.

43:08.215 --> 43:09.910
Leo.

43:10.084 --> 43:13.019
Sorry the reunion
isn't under better circumstances.

43:14.254 --> 43:16.779
Nice pad, kids.

43:16.957 --> 43:18.390
Oh, hey, Raph.

43:19.593 --> 43:22.153
Well, his vital signs seem to be okay.

43:22.763 --> 43:25.960
Pupil dilation is normal.

43:33.707 --> 43:37.973
Some sort of stone.
Probably obsidian, I think.

43:38.412 --> 43:40.642
Well, is he gonna be all right?

43:41.248 --> 43:43.478
You're still here?
Go back to your jungle.

43:43.650 --> 43:46.517
Well, at least
his personality's still intact.

43:46.687 --> 43:50.418
And there's an engraving on it.
Looks South American.

43:51.024 --> 43:53.458
That's your department, April.

43:56.096 --> 43:59.759
Would it help if I told you that those statues
you collected for Winters...

43:59.933 --> 44:02.629
...were shooting these things
at me and Raph?

44:04.004 --> 44:08.998
"The legend of Yoatl." It can't be.

44:09.610 --> 44:11.202
It was just a myth...

44:11.378 --> 44:14.905
...a scary story the locals told kids
around a campfire.

44:15.082 --> 44:17.175
Whoa, what are you talking about?

44:18.252 --> 44:23.280
They say 3000 years ago,
some great warrior...

44:23.457 --> 44:28.019
<i>... actually found a portal</i>
<i>to another dimension.</i>

44:35.002 --> 44:36.731
<i>And when the portal opened...</i>

44:36.904 --> 44:40.533
<i>... the energy from it</i>
<i>gave the warrior eternal life.</i>

44:40.707 --> 44:44.973
<i>But it also turned his generals to stone.</i>

44:45.312 --> 44:48.873
<i>What if this warrior</i>
<i>just kept living forever?</i>

44:49.049 --> 44:52.018
<i>He would spend</i>
<i>the rest of his days in regret...</i>

44:52.186 --> 44:56.145
<i>... spending all of his riches</i>
<i>and all of his power...</i>

44:56.323 --> 44:59.417
<i>... to find a way</i>
<i>to revive his stone generals.</i>

45:04.531 --> 45:07.329
<i>Maybe, just maybe...</i>

45:07.501 --> 45:10.470
<i>... he's built a new empire.</i>

45:25.519 --> 45:28.784
But, hey, like I said, it's just a myth.

45:30.190 --> 45:33.921
If you ask me, guys,
this has Winters' name written all over it.

45:34.094 --> 45:36.927
- How do you figure that, Donnie?
- Yeah.

45:37.097 --> 45:40.965
Because this has Winters' name
written all over it.

45:41.134 --> 45:43.728
Now I know who to thank
for this shot in the arm.

45:43.904 --> 45:46.372
So where do we find this guy
and his stone jokers?

45:46.540 --> 45:49.031
We're not going
until we get Splinter's blessing.

45:49.209 --> 45:52.804
You're gonna quote a rulebook to me
that you ain't been following for a year?

45:52.980 --> 45:56.279
If you got something you wanna
get off your shell, now's the time.

45:56.450 --> 45:59.544
But I'm not gonna stand here
and debate Splinter's orders with you.

46:01.616 --> 46:04.380
Fine, then. I quit.

46:05.787 --> 46:08.449
Hey, Raph. Don't do it, man.

46:08.623 --> 46:13.083
Sometimes just taking a breather
is the best thing to do.

46:15.097 --> 46:16.792
Whatever.

46:54.035 --> 46:56.503
To picking up the pieces.

46:58.306 --> 46:59.773
What is it?

46:59.941 --> 47:03.536
Two creatures remain, my lord.

47:03.712 --> 47:07.705
Well, by all means, then,
let's finish it.

47:07.883 --> 47:12.479
And you will finally be free
of your stone prison.

47:12.654 --> 47:17.751
But if the curse is broken,
we will no longer be immortal.

47:18.360 --> 47:21.796
Brother, do not question my command.

47:27.269 --> 47:29.737
- Here we go, now.
- So, what are we looking for?

47:29.905 --> 47:33.068
Well, according to these star charts,
the portal is set to open...

47:33.241 --> 47:37.143
...directly over Winters Tower
in the next 24 hours.

47:37.312 --> 47:40.406
So the legend is right.
Three thousand years.

47:40.582 --> 47:44.416
And when the portal opens,
we'll lose the city to monsters within hours.

47:44.586 --> 47:49.421
Within days, the country.
And within weeks, the world.

47:51.359 --> 47:56.160
Oh, so it's like Halley's comet,
only monsters come out?

47:57.799 --> 48:00.529
Yes. I guess so.

48:01.736 --> 48:03.829
I'm smart.

48:06.675 --> 48:08.006
I'm okay.

48:08.176 --> 48:09.734
Why do we need Raph, anyway?

48:09.911 --> 48:12.880
It's his temper that always
jeopardizes all our missions.

48:13.048 --> 48:16.609
Okay, Leo. Whatever you say.
Nobody was talking about him.

48:17.219 --> 48:22.987
Leonardo, this team
you are so eager to lead is incomplete.

48:23.158 --> 48:25.854
You know what you must do.

48:27.529 --> 48:29.861
Yes, sensei.

48:39.975 --> 48:44.605
Generals, I think our brother
has plans to betray us.

48:45.247 --> 48:50.116
The 13th monster must not be found.

48:53.455 --> 48:56.549
<i>Why don't we take one more call</i>
<i>about these monster sightings?</i>

48:56.725 --> 48:58.955
<i>Suffern, New Jersey, you're on.</i>

49:00.262 --> 49:02.890
Monster sightings.

49:22.484 --> 49:25.715
<i>A monster!</i>

49:25.887 --> 49:27.548
<i>Attention, all on-duty officers:</i>

49:27.722 --> 49:30.247
<i>Report of a disturbance on 32nd.</i>
<i>No units available.</i>

49:30.425 --> 49:32.450
They're playing my song.

49:35.730 --> 49:38.426
Where are the cops?
How come the cops haven't shown up?

49:38.600 --> 49:41.592
Just remember what my analyst said,
just go to my happy place.

49:41.770 --> 49:44.967
Everything's gonna be fine. Happy place.
I'm feeling good. I'm thin.

49:45.140 --> 49:47.973
Don't get up. I'll serve myself.

49:53.548 --> 49:55.607
Look at you. Ain't you cute?

49:55.784 --> 49:59.379
You want a butt-kicking, little fella?
Yes, you do. You do.

49:59.554 --> 50:03.957
Come on, I'm gonna drop-kick you
to hurty town. Come on, little guy.

50:06.528 --> 50:09.622
Get off of me, you little monster.

50:14.269 --> 50:16.294
You're scratching the helmet.

50:18.974 --> 50:21.306
Okay, that was different.

50:30.385 --> 50:34.151
Hey, this thing ain't rustproof.
Get off of me.

50:46.201 --> 50:47.998
Come on.

50:57.712 --> 50:59.839
How about a snack, little fella?

51:00.882 --> 51:02.372
Catch.

51:17.265 --> 51:19.893
Keep on running,
you filthy little hermit crab.

51:20.068 --> 51:22.730
That spicy meatball's on the house.

51:23.271 --> 51:25.569
Big guy, please don't hurt me.

51:25.740 --> 51:28.140
What? I'm not robbing you,
I'm helping you.

51:28.309 --> 51:31.437
Okay, whatever you say, sir.
Please, I got kids in college.

51:31.613 --> 51:32.739
Community college.

51:33.081 --> 51:34.981
Here you go, pal.
Make sure this is safe.

51:35.150 --> 51:37.141
Take everything.
I'm not even looking. Go.

51:37.318 --> 51:41.345
Why is it everyone's got such a hard time
believing I am a good guy?

51:41.523 --> 51:44.219
I just saved your life.

51:50.498 --> 51:53.262
This night just keeps getting
better and better.

52:23.832 --> 52:25.197
Get off my car.

52:56.364 --> 52:59.561
I want you to know
that I appreciate your intentions...

52:59.734 --> 53:02.032
...but you can't change the world
like this.

53:02.604 --> 53:04.902
- The road you're on is a dead end.
- Is he kidding?

53:05.073 --> 53:06.802
- I've tried it.
- He's lecturing.

53:06.975 --> 53:09.535
So I'm gonna give you one chance
to just walk away...

53:09.711 --> 53:12.612
...and stop this vigilante nonsense.

53:13.481 --> 53:15.312
Okay, Leo...

53:15.483 --> 53:19.078
...time to teach you a lesson.

53:23.591 --> 53:27.425
Look, trust me when I tell you,
you don't wanna do this.

53:30.632 --> 53:33.897
Oh, yeah.
Well, I notice you got quite a temper.

53:36.204 --> 53:38.434
Hey, have you ever done this before?

53:41.376 --> 53:43.901
Oh, come on. You call that an attack?

53:52.453 --> 53:55.820
All right. Finally, some excitement.

54:07.402 --> 54:08.960
Funny thing about anger:

54:09.137 --> 54:11.799
Let it consume you,
and soon enough...

54:14.776 --> 54:18.143
...you lose sight of everything.

54:29.224 --> 54:31.385
Good night, dark prince.

54:35.163 --> 54:36.653
Raph?

54:38.166 --> 54:39.292
What?

54:42.303 --> 54:44.635
You are so smug, you know that?

54:44.806 --> 54:47.172
You think the world revolves around you,
don't you?

54:47.342 --> 54:50.311
We couldn't survive without
the mighty and powerful Leonardo...

54:50.478 --> 54:52.309
...to guide us through our problems.

54:52.480 --> 54:56.143
Well, I got a news flash for you:
We got along just fine without you.

54:56.317 --> 55:01.186
Oh, and this qualifies as "just fine"?
Dressing up like it's Halloween every night?

55:01.356 --> 55:05.292
Risking the safety of our family?
I mean, come on, what were you thinking?

55:05.460 --> 55:07.758
Don't push it.
You can't leave and come back...

55:07.929 --> 55:10.762
...expecting us to fall in line
like your little soldiers.

55:10.932 --> 55:15.596
Hey, I was training.
Training to be a better leader, for you.

55:15.770 --> 55:19.103
- Why do you hate me for that?
- And whoever said I wanted to be led?

55:19.274 --> 55:22.141
I'm better off calling my own shots now.
Get used to it.

55:22.310 --> 55:26.246
You aren't ready.
You're impatient and hot-tempered.

55:26.414 --> 55:30.350
And more importantly,
I'm better than you.

55:32.287 --> 55:34.255
Oh, you know something, big brother?

55:34.422 --> 55:37.914
I'd have to disagree with you
on that one.

55:40.561 --> 55:42.358
Don't do this, Raph.

55:43.364 --> 55:45.798
I'm done taking orders.

57:50.758 --> 57:52.191
Not human...

57:52.660 --> 57:56.994
...but clearly not the final monster.

57:57.765 --> 58:00.928
Yoatl won't know the difference.

58:01.102 --> 58:06.699
By the time our brother discovers
this turtle is not the 13th monster...

58:07.075 --> 58:10.772
...it will already be too late.

58:15.016 --> 58:16.677
Leo.

58:30.231 --> 58:33.496
Leo. Hang on.

58:36.904 --> 58:39.134
Leo.

58:39.607 --> 58:42.098
Leo.

58:51.919 --> 58:55.320
No!

59:14.809 --> 59:18.040
Raphael. What is the matter?

59:18.212 --> 59:20.544
I was out. I was out and I did...
I did something.

59:20.715 --> 59:23.684
Something happened
and then I... And I...

59:25.319 --> 59:28.254
Raphael. Kneel.

59:29.690 --> 59:31.521
I did something.

59:31.692 --> 59:34.024
I did something really stupid,
Master Splinter.

59:35.163 --> 59:36.755
Go on.

59:37.732 --> 59:39.723
I know why you chose him now.

59:39.901 --> 59:43.803
I know that there's a reason
why he's the better son and I'm not.

59:43.971 --> 59:50.001
Raphael, you always bear
the world's problems on your shoulders.

59:50.178 --> 59:56.447
It is an admirable quality
when you are a protector of others.

59:56.617 --> 01:00:02.647
But you must realize that while, at times,
you may not be my favorite student...

01:00:02.823 --> 01:00:07.317
...it does not mean
that you are my least-favorite son.

01:00:07.495 --> 01:00:12.558
You are strong, passionate
and loyal to a fault.

01:00:12.733 --> 01:00:16.726
These are the merits
of a great leader as well...

01:00:16.904 --> 01:00:21.102
...but only when tempered
with compassion and humility.

01:00:21.275 --> 01:00:24.733
But, Master Splinter,
I messed up big tonight.

01:00:24.912 --> 01:00:27.403
I mean big.

01:00:30.518 --> 01:00:32.008
They took him.

01:00:38.793 --> 01:00:40.556
Leonardo.

01:00:41.195 --> 01:00:42.753
Yeah.

01:00:49.737 --> 01:00:52.570
Then the time for hiding is over.

01:00:52.740 --> 01:00:58.406
We must return to the surface
to take back what is ours.

01:01:00.181 --> 01:01:03.275
By your wish, Father.

01:01:06.120 --> 01:01:10.352
Long have we been in hiding.
Perhaps too long.

01:01:10.524 --> 01:01:13.584
Well, what do we do now?

01:01:13.761 --> 01:01:15.490
I'll tell you what we're gonna do.

01:01:15.663 --> 01:01:20.032
We're gonna rescue our brother,
and then we're gonna save New York City.

01:02:26.801 --> 01:02:29.827
I got it on my last trip to Japan.
You like it?

01:02:30.004 --> 01:02:31.904
Oh, yeah.

01:02:34.008 --> 01:02:36.203
No way.

01:02:38.679 --> 01:02:41.045
You can't go trick-or-treating
without your mask.

01:02:42.083 --> 01:02:45.109
Oh, babe. Thanks.

01:03:01.402 --> 01:03:04.860
As ordered,
no one gets into the tower...

01:03:05.039 --> 01:03:10.204
...no one interferes,
no one bears witness.

01:03:19.987 --> 01:03:22.251
You've got to be kidding me.

01:03:24.492 --> 01:03:28.588
Cowabunga, dude. I'm here
for little Maxie's 13th birthday party.

01:03:28.763 --> 01:03:30.094
Leave now.

01:03:30.264 --> 01:03:33.097
Oh, but you don't understand, lady.
I got...

01:04:21.215 --> 01:04:27.085
At last. After 3000 years,
the time is finally at hand.

01:04:47.608 --> 01:04:51.009
What...? What have you done?

01:04:51.879 --> 01:04:54.848
Your time for giving orders is over.

01:04:55.049 --> 01:04:56.414
You don't understand.

01:04:56.584 --> 01:04:58.609
I want to send these creatures back...

01:04:58.786 --> 01:05:01.448
...to undo the damage
that was done so many years ago.

01:05:01.622 --> 01:05:04.682
Time has done nothing
but made you weak.

01:05:04.859 --> 01:05:07.123
We have our own plans.

01:05:07.294 --> 01:05:09.489
Immortality is a curse, brother.

01:05:09.663 --> 01:05:12.063
Trust me, I've lived long enough to know.

01:05:12.233 --> 01:05:15.361
We have to find that 13th monster.
It's time to end it.

01:05:15.536 --> 01:05:17.128
No.

01:05:18.439 --> 01:05:21.636
Our time is just beginning.

01:05:44.231 --> 01:05:46.699
- Little help, Don.
- I'm on it.

01:05:56.877 --> 01:05:58.845
Heads up, dudes.

01:05:59.013 --> 01:06:01.174
Goal.

01:06:04.852 --> 01:06:07.616
Guys, front door's open. Now.

01:06:08.022 --> 01:06:10.547
Two minutes for high sticking.

01:06:13.928 --> 01:06:17.989
Dudes, that rocked. Let's go again.

01:06:27.875 --> 01:06:30.969
- Dudes, what do we do?
- I'm working on it.

01:06:32.246 --> 01:06:34.111
You break it, you buy it.

01:06:39.219 --> 01:06:41.278
Yeah. All right.

01:06:41.455 --> 01:06:44.083
All right. Nice.

01:06:44.258 --> 01:06:47.386
- Nice work, Jones.
- I have my moments.

01:06:47.561 --> 01:06:49.586
Whoa, check it out.

01:06:49.763 --> 01:06:53.358
That would be the swirling vortex
to another world, I assume.

01:06:53.534 --> 01:06:55.525
Cool. I want one.

01:06:58.639 --> 01:07:00.129
Leo, is that you?

01:07:02.076 --> 01:07:03.873
Sorry, wrong cage.

01:07:06.747 --> 01:07:09.580
- Leo. I got him.
- Out of the way, please.

01:07:16.890 --> 01:07:20.155
Hey, buddy. Come on, man. Up we go.

01:07:20.761 --> 01:07:22.626
There you go.

01:07:33.874 --> 01:07:37.173
You're gonna need these
if you're gonna lead us out of here.

01:07:38.812 --> 01:07:41.076
I'm gonna need you too.

01:07:47.755 --> 01:07:50.815
- Winters.
- Looks more like fall. Get it?

01:07:50.991 --> 01:07:52.686
Mikey, remember our talk.

01:07:55.629 --> 01:07:58.325
Looks like someone got to him
before us.

01:08:01.335 --> 01:08:02.825
Is he dead?

01:08:08.242 --> 01:08:10.608
Not so immortal, huh, dudes?

01:08:14.515 --> 01:08:17.484
Your time's run out, Winters.

01:08:18.085 --> 01:08:19.575
Miss O'Neil.

01:08:19.752 --> 01:08:24.314
I must have hit my head pretty hard.
I'm seeing giant turtles.

01:08:24.491 --> 01:08:27.460
We know what you're up to, Winters.
We know about the portal...

01:08:27.627 --> 01:08:30.893
...and we think that it's time
you sent all these monsters home.

01:08:34.468 --> 01:08:36.299
I couldn't agree with you more.

01:08:36.470 --> 01:08:40.462
It is time to put an end to the curse
that I have brought upon myself...

01:08:40.640 --> 01:08:42.939
...and this world.

01:08:43.109 --> 01:08:47.513
That's what this is about, Miss O'Neil:
Penance.

01:08:47.680 --> 01:08:52.983
I must return all 13 beasts
or our curse will continue.

01:08:53.153 --> 01:08:57.590
And that is a torment
I can no longer bear.

01:08:57.758 --> 01:09:01.854
Then you should be
put out of your misery.

01:09:02.595 --> 01:09:05.962
I think we walked in
on a family feud, guys.

01:09:06.233 --> 01:09:11.068
The time has come to reopen the portal
and rain destruction upon the Earth.

01:09:11.238 --> 01:09:13.206
Nothing will stand in our way...

01:09:13.372 --> 01:09:16.341
...when we have an army
at our command.

01:09:16.510 --> 01:09:20.037
- My brothers, I...
- We are no brothers to you.

01:09:20.214 --> 01:09:26.015
With one monster still free,
the curse will never be broken.

01:09:26.185 --> 01:09:30.622
We shall finish what we began
all those years ago.

01:09:30.791 --> 01:09:33.555
And we will finally have our victory.

01:09:33.727 --> 01:09:36.696
Join us. Join us, Foot Clan.

01:09:36.863 --> 01:09:40.800
Swear your allegiance to us
and no harm will befall you.

01:09:42.402 --> 01:09:48.533
The Foot ninja is not without honor.
We work for Winters, not you.

01:09:53.046 --> 01:09:55.344
Okay, what does that mean?

01:09:55.516 --> 01:09:58.508
It means we're going to help you.

01:09:58.685 --> 01:10:03.588
My ninja will find the last monster
and you will bring it back here.

01:10:03.757 --> 01:10:05.486
Hurry, we don't have much time.

01:10:09.129 --> 01:10:11.529
Hey. I got shotgun.

01:10:11.698 --> 01:10:13.256
Forget about them.

01:10:13.433 --> 01:10:17.267
By the time they return,
the portal will already be closed...

01:10:17.437 --> 01:10:20.065
...with you inside it.

01:10:20.340 --> 01:10:22.399
I hate to see brothers fight like this.

01:10:22.576 --> 01:10:25.443
Unless it's together.

01:10:27.247 --> 01:10:31.843
Hate to rain on your parade, pal,
but we thought we'd even the odds.

01:10:32.019 --> 01:10:34.988
We're going to enjoy this.

01:10:40.961 --> 01:10:44.192
If you please. They can defeat them.

01:10:44.364 --> 01:10:46.696
They are a team.

01:10:47.134 --> 01:10:50.570
Let's hope so, because if not,
Aguila will use the portal...

01:10:50.737 --> 01:10:55.970
...to draw forth an army of evil
and the world will be lost.

01:10:57.711 --> 01:11:01.943
More beasts.
Let's send them back where they belong.

01:11:07.955 --> 01:11:09.616
Temper, temper.

01:11:24.137 --> 01:11:25.934
Come to daddy.

01:11:32.779 --> 01:11:35.475
Thing about you immortal stone guys is...

01:11:35.649 --> 01:11:38.345
...you know, you're immortal
and made of stone.

01:11:38.518 --> 01:11:40.509
I sound like Mikey.

01:11:41.855 --> 01:11:44.915
You fight well. You should join us.

01:11:45.225 --> 01:11:47.591
No, thanks, I'm good.

01:11:56.336 --> 01:11:59.703
These guys really don't die.
Sensei, are you all right?

01:12:00.874 --> 01:12:03.206
We must do this more often.

01:12:06.013 --> 01:12:07.810
I still got it.

01:12:10.617 --> 01:12:12.949
They'd better hurry
with that last monster.

01:12:13.120 --> 01:12:15.987
I'm sure my man Casey's
got it all under control.

01:12:16.957 --> 01:12:19.425
That's what I'm afraid of.

01:12:25.165 --> 01:12:26.826
Can't this piece of junk go faster?

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.059
- Wanna drive?
- I would, as a matter of fact.

01:12:29.236 --> 01:12:35.141
You would think they would be
more concerned about the 13th monster.

01:12:59.766 --> 01:13:02.064
Boys, we must finish this now.

01:13:27.728 --> 01:13:29.218
So did we win?

01:13:36.503 --> 01:13:40.940
Foolish creatures.
We are immortals made of stone.

01:13:41.108 --> 01:13:43.872
Without the final monster
to break our curse...

01:13:44.044 --> 01:13:47.036
...we will never be stopped.

01:13:49.416 --> 01:13:51.247
Special delivery.

01:13:57.224 --> 01:13:58.418
Look out.

01:14:39.399 --> 01:14:41.629
So did we win now?

01:14:41.802 --> 01:14:44.566
- Yeah, I think we did.
- We won.

01:14:44.738 --> 01:14:45.898
- All right.
- Yeah!

01:14:46.073 --> 01:14:49.042
All right. That's what I'm talking about.

01:14:49.443 --> 01:14:50.774
Yeah!

01:14:51.378 --> 01:14:53.573
Nice parallel parking.

01:14:53.747 --> 01:14:57.012
Next time, I'm driving.

01:15:01.321 --> 01:15:04.017
Hey. Watch the hair.

01:15:08.795 --> 01:15:12.458
Typical. We do all the work,
he gets all the thanks.

01:15:17.938 --> 01:15:21.806
You are every bit the warriors
I was informed you were.

01:15:21.975 --> 01:15:23.465
You have passed.

01:15:23.643 --> 01:15:26.578
Savor your victory tonight.

01:15:26.746 --> 01:15:30.648
For soon, we will have
further business together.

01:15:30.817 --> 01:15:35.516
The kind that involves familiar faces
from your past.

01:15:36.690 --> 01:15:38.783
She doesn't mean...

01:15:43.864 --> 01:15:48.028
Come on. What is it with ninjas
and smoke pellets?

01:15:54.274 --> 01:15:56.538
Looks like you picked a good time
to come home.

01:15:56.710 --> 01:16:00.510
Thanks for bringing me back.

01:16:05.519 --> 01:16:07.009
Winters?

01:16:11.892 --> 01:16:14.588
I'm never usually that happy
to be in pain.

01:16:14.761 --> 01:16:17.753
He's happy because he's mortal again,
Mikey.

01:16:17.931 --> 01:16:21.162
April. I've had my eye on you
for a long time.

01:16:21.334 --> 01:16:22.801
I knew it.

01:16:22.969 --> 01:16:28.771
I've always known that you'd be the one
to help me find my way home.

01:16:30.076 --> 01:16:31.771
And thank you...

01:16:32.145 --> 01:16:33.840
...brothers.

01:16:34.014 --> 01:16:40.351
You've made a very old man
very, very happy.

01:16:41.354 --> 01:16:44.653
So, what happens now?

01:17:28.902 --> 01:17:33.134
Okay. Just a little bit creepy.

01:17:34.040 --> 01:17:39.501
Oh, gross. I think he's in my no...
My no... My no...

01:17:42.182 --> 01:17:44.878
Gross. Somebody give me a hankie.

01:17:46.553 --> 01:17:48.783
Now he's in my mouth.

01:17:48.955 --> 01:17:51.355
Tastes awful.

01:18:21.521 --> 01:18:23.955
You got room for one more?

01:18:41.308 --> 01:18:44.243
Can I get rid of this too?

01:19:01.161 --> 01:19:03.527
<i>We live together. We train together.</i>

01:19:03.697 --> 01:19:07.224
<i>We fight together.</i>
<i>We stand for good, together.</i>

01:19:07.400 --> 01:19:09.391
<i>We are ninjas.</i>

01:19:09.569 --> 01:19:14.905
<i>We strike hard, defend, protect,</i>
<i>and fade into the night.</i>

01:19:15.075 --> 01:19:18.238
<i>And there ain't no bad guy or monster</i>
<i>gonna ever change that.</i>

01:19:18.411 --> 01:19:20.174
<i>That's what's important.</i>

01:19:20.347 --> 01:19:24.181
<i>And that's why</i>
<i>we'll always be brothers.</i>

01:19:25.752 --> 01:19:28.516
<i>Oh, I love being a turtle.</i>

01:26:45.925 --> 01:26:47.916
