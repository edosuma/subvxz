00:02.280 --> 00:04.240
I'm so sorry, Mr Selfridge.

00:04.280 --> 00:06.440
I don't see the Selfridge's
livery on the side.

00:06.480 --> 00:09.240
It's always you that loads it?
I do what Alfie and Sam tell me.

00:09.280 --> 00:12.480
You're a shop girl.

00:12.520 --> 00:17.040
Lost your job, have you? You've done
your damage. What more do you want?

00:17.560 --> 00:19.720
I am Selfridge.

00:19.760 --> 00:21.560
You knew I was falling
in love with you.

00:21.600 --> 00:23.560
Was it revenge for Ellen Love,
was that it?

00:23.600 --> 00:25.480
Your contract with Selfridge's
is over.

00:25.520 --> 00:27.200
I don't see your wife anywhere!

00:27.240 --> 00:29.880
My wife is not your concern.
Goodbye, Ellen.

01:00.562 --> 01:03.282
This seems a rather expensive
enterprise, Mr Selfridge.

01:03.322 --> 01:06.402
It will more than pay for itself.
How will we get it in the window?

01:06.442 --> 01:08.642
Don't worry about that.
Henri's an old hand.

01:08.682 --> 01:10.842
We'll dismantle it
and then put it together.

01:10.882 --> 01:14.862
My God! It worked like a dream
for us at Marshall Field.

01:14.911 --> 01:16.671
But back then,

01:16.711 --> 01:21.071
there were only 1,500 registered
drivers in the whole of Chicago.

01:21.111 --> 01:26.151
In London today, there are over
36,000. They'll come, they'll see,

01:26.191 --> 01:28.991
they'll walk inside
and they'll buy the products.

01:29.031 --> 01:30.871
Isn't she a beauty?

01:30.911 --> 01:34.551
This automobile is not insured
for anyone to drive.

01:34.591 --> 01:36.791
Not even you, Mr Selfridge.

01:36.831 --> 01:38.831
Ah!

01:38.871 --> 01:41.191
What do you think?

01:41.231 --> 01:43.871
Magnificent!
How is the window shaping up?

01:43.911 --> 01:46.871
"Motoring for the Modern Age!"

01:46.911 --> 01:49.511
Well, I miss Agnes Towler's
keen eye.

01:49.551 --> 01:51.351
So get her to work with you.

01:52.391 --> 01:54.071
I can't. She's gone.

01:54.991 --> 01:56.751
Gone?

01:56.791 --> 01:58.911
What? Didn't you know?

01:58.951 --> 02:02.031
After that business with her father,
she has left.

02:05.591 --> 02:08.110
Well, at least
George is still in work.

02:08.911 --> 02:11.071
Without his wages,
I don't know where we'd be.

02:12.111 --> 02:15.471
You'll look out for him, won't you?
Course I will.

02:17.431 --> 02:19.551
My dad's come back.

02:19.591 --> 02:21.271
I thought you'd changed the locks?

02:22.391 --> 02:26.511
He turned up last night, drunk,
passed out on the stairs.

02:26.551 --> 02:29.311
My landlady told me
if I didn't get him out of the way,

02:29.351 --> 02:31.871
that we'd all be out.
We'll have to work out something.

02:31.911 --> 02:34.911
He can't stay here forever.
I've been thinking...

02:34.951 --> 02:36.991
maybe it's not so bad
you left your job.

02:38.591 --> 02:40.431
What?
Well, for you and me.

02:40.471 --> 02:42.431
We can go out together now.

02:42.471 --> 02:45.151
How about we go down
to Brighton this weekend?

02:45.191 --> 02:48.151
Brighton? What would we do there?

02:48.191 --> 02:53.351
Walk on the beach, go down the pier,
hold hands in the moonlight.

02:53.391 --> 02:56.711
I know you're trying to cheer me up,
but I'm not in the mood.

02:56.751 --> 02:59.471
I'm asking if I can court you.

02:59.511 --> 03:01.631
That's what I'm doing!

03:02.791 --> 03:04.471
Oh, I see.

03:04.511 --> 03:06.511
Hadn't it crossed your mind at all?

03:07.711 --> 03:09.391
Not really.

03:10.751 --> 03:12.711
Well, maybe a bit...

03:12.751 --> 03:15.871
A bit?
Well, I suppose that's a start.

03:17.031 --> 03:20.791
I like you, Victor, you know I do.

03:20.831 --> 03:23.511
But I'm more trouble than I'm worth.

03:23.551 --> 03:27.911
What with George and my dad,
and me without a job.

03:29.831 --> 03:31.831
You don't want to court me.

03:31.871 --> 03:34.951
I do. More than anything.

03:36.000 --> 03:42.074

03:46.271 --> 03:48.071
Are you my girl then?

03:49.431 --> 03:51.391
I think I must be.

04:14.111 --> 04:17.511
Miss Towler available?
I always deal with Miss Towler!

04:17.551 --> 04:20.190
I can't imagine wearing
that over my face.

04:20.231 --> 04:23.231
Keeps the flies out of your mouth,
I suppose.

04:24.231 --> 04:26.191
Lady Carlyle's here, Miss Mardle.

04:26.231 --> 04:28.991
She wants to see all the
motoring gloves that we've got.

04:29.031 --> 04:31.111
Well, show them to her!

04:31.151 --> 04:33.431
She's asking for Miss Towler.

04:33.471 --> 04:36.231
Tell her Miss Towler has left,
but you can help her.

04:36.271 --> 04:38.351
Shoulders back, good diction.

04:45.991 --> 04:49.151
Those are the most supple leather
we have, Lady Carlyle.

04:49.191 --> 04:54.511
The abrasions on the palm allow the
driver to grip the steering wheel.

04:57.191 --> 05:00.191
What are we to say to customers
about Agnes, Miss Mardle?

05:00.231 --> 05:03.591
You'll be courteous and assist them
with whatever they are looking for.

05:03.631 --> 05:05.391
Now get on with your work, Doris.

05:05.431 --> 05:08.991
It must say 'Motoring',
at a glance. What do you have?

05:09.031 --> 05:10.951
This is the Dorothy Levitt blazer,

05:10.991 --> 05:12.871
inspired by the great motorist
herself.

05:15.631 --> 05:17.671
A woman could wear this anywhere,

05:17.711 --> 05:21.151
walking, bicycling,
even to a garden party. No?

05:23.591 --> 05:25.391
I have just the coat.

05:25.431 --> 05:27.311
It's new in.

05:33.631 --> 05:35.871
It also comes in leather.

05:35.911 --> 05:39.591
A lady in leather -
does that appeal, Mr Leclair?

05:39.631 --> 05:42.111
Very much, Miss Ravillious.

05:42.151 --> 05:44.391
Leather is good, thank you.

05:45.911 --> 05:48.431
Do you have an appointment
to see Mrs Selfridge?

05:48.471 --> 05:50.231
She'll see me.
Just tell her I'm here.

05:50.271 --> 05:52.071
Rose!

05:52.111 --> 05:53.911
Rose!

05:53.951 --> 05:55.951
Mrs Selfridge.
It's alright, Fraser.

05:55.991 --> 05:59.311
Apologies, Mr Temple. I'd forgotten
that I was expecting you.

05:59.351 --> 06:01.911
I see you've brought the painting.
Please, come in.

06:10.431 --> 06:12.111
What are you doing here?

06:14.591 --> 06:18.631
Look, I, erm... I came to apologise
for the other day.

06:18.671 --> 06:21.351
I was rude to you and...

06:22.951 --> 06:25.431
Well, I've been feeling awful
about it.

06:25.471 --> 06:29.991
I'm sorry too. I shouldn't
have lied about who I was.

06:30.031 --> 06:32.431
No.

06:33.271 --> 06:34.951
Friends?

06:34.991 --> 06:37.191
Mm. It depends.

06:37.231 --> 06:39.111
On what?

06:40.431 --> 06:43.351
On this!
Come on, I'm dying to see it!

06:43.391 --> 06:45.671
Can I?
Yes. Please...

06:45.711 --> 06:48.631
I can't believe you've finished it!

06:55.551 --> 06:57.231
What do you think?

06:57.271 --> 07:00.351
It's nothing like
you've done before.

07:01.671 --> 07:03.751
I told you, you inspire me.

07:03.791 --> 07:06.751
It's good. It's really good.

07:06.791 --> 07:08.871
Thank you.

07:12.151 --> 07:13.831
Harry will like it.

07:13.871 --> 07:15.791
I don't want him to have it.

07:15.831 --> 07:17.511
Don't you see?

07:17.551 --> 07:20.471
Now you've brought it into the
house, I have to give it to him.

07:20.511 --> 07:23.391
I have responsibilities and
I've been pretending I haven't -

07:23.431 --> 07:25.151
Your husband neglects you.

07:25.831 --> 07:28.711
No, I love him and...

07:28.751 --> 07:31.311
he loves me too, in his own way.

07:31.911 --> 07:33.631
Not like I could.

07:51.071 --> 07:52.751
Who are you?

07:52.791 --> 07:56.871
Erm... I'm a friend of
your mother's.

07:58.271 --> 08:02.911
This is Mr Temple, and...
he's been painting my picture.

08:02.951 --> 08:06.431
I'm gonna give it to Pa
as a present.

08:08.951 --> 08:10.631
Your painting!

08:10.671 --> 08:13.871
Yes, I used to paint,
before you came along.

08:13.911 --> 08:17.871
Now, run along to Grandma.
I'm just gonna see Mr Temple out.

08:17.911 --> 08:21.511
Oh, and Beatrice darling, erm...

08:21.551 --> 08:24.751
don't tell anyone about this.

08:25.911 --> 08:27.631
It's a surprise.

08:39.390 --> 08:41.150
Oh no!

08:41.191 --> 08:42.910
Will she say anything?

08:42.951 --> 08:45.431
I don't know. You have to go.

08:46.751 --> 08:48.431
You have to go!

08:54.551 --> 08:56.231
I can't.

08:56.271 --> 08:58.911
You're not a conventional person
at heart.

08:58.951 --> 09:03.151
Don't stifle your true self.
This may be your last chance.

09:07.471 --> 09:10.231
No...

09:11.351 --> 09:13.071
No.

09:15.271 --> 09:17.151
You'll see me again.

09:17.191 --> 09:19.311
You can depend on that.

09:38.960 --> 09:40.720
How fast does it go?

09:40.768 --> 09:43.248
Forty, fifty miles an hour.

09:43.288 --> 09:44.928
When you're behind the wheel
of one of these,

09:44.993 --> 09:48.193
you feel like you're going so fast,
that nothing can touch you.

09:48.233 --> 09:50.313
Wow! I wanna drive one.
You will one day.

09:50.353 --> 09:52.033
Uh-oh!

09:52.073 --> 09:53.753
We've been spotted, Gordon!

09:54.233 --> 09:55.993
Be brave, prepare for....

09:57.753 --> 09:59.433
Come here, you!

10:01.273 --> 10:03.113
I've got a secret
that I can't tell you.

10:03.153 --> 10:05.673
You do? Well, I'm gonna
tickle it out of you! Come on!

10:05.713 --> 10:07.393
What is it?

10:21.913 --> 10:24.353
What time is it? Is it late?

10:27.953 --> 10:29.753
Harry, you shouldn't have opened it.

10:29.793 --> 10:31.473
It was a present for you.

10:31.513 --> 10:33.753
I didn't realise
that you missed painting.

10:33.793 --> 10:36.593
Yeah, I don't think
I realised it either.

10:38.073 --> 10:40.113
Who's the artist?

10:42.593 --> 10:44.833
He's called Roderick Temple.

10:46.553 --> 10:50.353
He caught you well.
Where did you meet him?

10:50.393 --> 10:52.153
At the National Gallery.

10:53.553 --> 10:55.353
And where did he paint you?

10:56.753 --> 10:58.433
In his studio.

11:01.473 --> 11:03.473
Harry, he's just a boy.

11:03.513 --> 11:06.593
If I'd considered it at all
inappropriate to be painted by him,

11:06.633 --> 11:08.353
I wouldn't have gone ahead with it!

11:08.393 --> 11:10.513
I thought you could
hang it in your office,

11:10.553 --> 11:12.233
on the wall opposite your desk.

11:12.273 --> 11:14.713
But if you don't like it...

11:17.713 --> 11:19.593
I just wish I'd known, that's all.

11:19.633 --> 11:22.233
If you had, it wouldn't have been
a surprise, would it?

11:25.873 --> 11:28.473
You know I value you,
more than anything.

11:29.513 --> 11:31.393
Yes Harry, I know that.

11:33.953 --> 11:35.673
Where are you off to so early?

11:36.633 --> 11:38.313
There's something I need to do.

11:51.793 --> 11:53.473
I got it.

11:53.513 --> 11:55.193
Wait right here for me, thank you.

11:55.233 --> 11:58.233
Give me money! Give me money!
Oh, is that the biggest one?

11:58.273 --> 12:00.953
There we go. You had the money
the whole time, right there!

12:00.993 --> 12:03.153
Ha ha! I'm outnumbered!

12:30.553 --> 12:33.673
Of course, you'll have to
get yourself another job.

12:36.793 --> 12:39.913
I mean, we can't all three of us
live off George's wages.

12:42.913 --> 12:44.593
Who are you?

12:44.633 --> 12:47.233
The front door was open.
I'm looking for Agnes Towler.

12:47.273 --> 12:49.433
We don't accept gentlemen callers.

12:55.193 --> 12:56.953
Wait in there.

13:08.873 --> 13:13.073
Here, I've got a mate,
and he owns this pub in Poplar,

13:13.113 --> 13:14.953
and he's looking for a bar maid.

13:14.993 --> 13:18.953
A bar maid? What's wrong with that?
You're lucky to get the offer.

13:22.153 --> 13:25.273
Swell downstairs for you.
I put him in the front parlour.

13:31.193 --> 13:33.193
Mr Selfridge!

13:33.233 --> 13:34.953
What are... What are you doing here?

13:36.233 --> 13:37.953
I could say the same for you.

13:38.873 --> 13:40.553
Why aren't you at the store?

13:40.593 --> 13:44.513
I left. I won't accept it.
I'm here to take you back.

13:45.473 --> 13:47.433
You show great potential.

13:47.473 --> 13:50.193
You remind me of myself
when I started out.

13:50.233 --> 13:54.513
Grasping for every chance,
keen as mustard to learn.

13:54.553 --> 13:56.553
You love it, don't you?

13:56.593 --> 14:00.633
The customers, the selling, the feel
of the merchandise under your hands.

14:00.673 --> 14:02.433
I love it more than anything.

14:02.473 --> 14:04.473
That's why I don't wanna lose you.

14:04.513 --> 14:08.593
Come back. Who cares what happened
with your father?

14:08.633 --> 14:10.313
If you don't, no one else will.

14:10.353 --> 14:12.473
But Mr Selfridge, don't you?

14:13.313 --> 14:15.033
You're not him.

14:17.513 --> 14:19.353
All the, erm...

14:20.393 --> 14:24.873
I can't seem to find my way
out of it, that's the trouble.

14:24.913 --> 14:29.593
Every time I try to set myself and
George up without him, he finds us.

14:35.793 --> 14:37.473
Thank you.

14:37.513 --> 14:39.433
Is he in the house now?

14:43.913 --> 14:45.913
Let me go talk to him.

15:11.393 --> 15:14.793
Who the bloody hell are you?
Harry Gordon Selfridge.

15:15.793 --> 15:19.073
I have certain conditions
to put before you.

15:19.113 --> 15:22.793
What conditions?
Leave London immediately.

15:22.833 --> 15:27.233
Live anywhere you like as long
as it's a good distance from here.

15:28.513 --> 15:30.953
Who the hell do you think you are?

15:31.953 --> 15:33.953
You come round here,

15:33.993 --> 15:39.273
and you think that
you can tell me what to do?

15:42.193 --> 15:44.193
This should pay for your travel,

15:44.233 --> 15:47.353
keep food in your stomach
while you look for work.

15:49.353 --> 15:51.193
Oh, I get it.

15:52.273 --> 15:55.553
You have taken a bit of a shine
to my Aggie.

15:55.593 --> 15:59.673
Tell me, has she offered
her services to you?

15:59.713 --> 16:02.113
Argh!
Understand me!

16:02.153 --> 16:05.353
If you drink your way through this
and end up on the street,

16:05.393 --> 16:07.873
you will not return to London
to bother your daughter!

16:07.913 --> 16:09.593
You will not contact her,

16:09.633 --> 16:12.073
you will not come to my store
and seek her out.

16:12.113 --> 16:17.633
I will not let you ruin her life!

16:17.673 --> 16:19.353
All right, stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!

16:19.393 --> 16:21.553
Stop! Stop! Please! Stop!

16:21.593 --> 16:23.593
Please!

16:35.473 --> 16:37.313
Do we have an agreement?

16:46.353 --> 16:48.033
Hello, son.

16:50.273 --> 16:53.633
'Your pa ain't no war hero.
He ain't dead either!'

16:53.673 --> 16:56.633
'My ma says he's alive
and living in Freemont...'

17:10.833 --> 17:12.553
Pa?

17:13.553 --> 17:15.233
Who is that lady, Pa?

17:15.272 --> 17:17.992
Why aren't you at home
with Ma and me?

17:18.032 --> 17:21.353
Your ma's high-toned bullshit
did it for me,

17:21.393 --> 17:23.193
that's why I never came home.

17:23.233 --> 17:27.553
But I'm your blood and you're mine,
whether you like it or not...

17:29.553 --> 17:31.793
Mr Selfridge? Mr Selfridge?

17:31.833 --> 17:33.513
Mr Selfridge?

17:33.553 --> 17:35.233
Is everything all right?

17:48.753 --> 17:51.873
He'll be gone by the time you
get back from work this evening.

17:54.073 --> 17:56.793
What do you mean?
Just what I say - gone.

17:56.833 --> 18:00.393
In this type of situations,
it's best to make a clean break.

18:00.433 --> 18:02.633
No fond farewells. You understand?

18:04.113 --> 18:07.073
Grab your coat and hat.
I'll give you a ride into the store.

18:30.033 --> 18:31.833
Well, did you enjoy the ride?

18:32.753 --> 18:34.993
It felt like flying!

18:35.433 --> 18:37.953
Who knows?
One day, you may do that as well.

18:39.753 --> 18:41.833
Thank you, Mr Selfridge.

18:43.273 --> 18:46.633
Now, you remember.
Don't apologise, don't explain.

18:46.673 --> 18:49.353
As a tactic, it's always
worked well for me.

18:55.473 --> 18:57.153
Thank you.
That's all right.

19:09.913 --> 19:11.593
Look!

19:12.393 --> 19:14.193
What's she doing back?

19:14.953 --> 19:17.873
Can I help you, Miss Towler?
I've come back, Miss Mardle.

19:17.913 --> 19:20.353
Well, I'm afraid
that's not possible, my dear.

19:20.393 --> 19:23.873
It was a mistake.
I didn't hand in my notice.

19:23.913 --> 19:27.233
If you check, I'm still employed
by Selfridge's, by Mr Selfridge.

19:28.393 --> 19:31.513
Right, well, I will have to confirm
that with Mr Grove of course.

19:31.553 --> 19:33.793
But in the meantime,
we can put you to use.

19:33.833 --> 19:35.513
You can unpack the new stock.

19:35.553 --> 19:37.673
We are embarking on
a motor driving promotion

19:37.713 --> 19:39.753
and those lap robes
have just come in.

19:39.793 --> 19:41.593
Very good, Miss Mardle.

19:47.553 --> 19:49.233
You can't just swan back in.

19:49.273 --> 19:51.433
Looks like I just have.

19:53.833 --> 19:55.953
Miss Towler!
Hello.

19:56.833 --> 19:59.073
You've returned to us.

19:59.113 --> 20:00.913
That is wonderful.

20:02.753 --> 20:04.433
Welcome back.

20:23.953 --> 20:25.633
George lad.

20:25.673 --> 20:27.913
Give us an 'and over here.
I'll just finish this.

20:27.953 --> 20:29.633
Now!

20:39.073 --> 20:40.753
Thank you.

20:55.593 --> 20:58.113
Miss Ellen Love,
to see Mrs Selfridge.

21:05.233 --> 21:08.433
Miss Love, what a pleasant surprise.

21:08.473 --> 21:12.913
I'm afraid this isn't
a social visit, Mrs Selfridge.

21:12.953 --> 21:14.873
Oh? What a pity.

21:14.913 --> 21:18.833
Er, please,
can I offer you some coffee?

21:21.073 --> 21:25.313
I'm here to tell you
that your husband has not
been faithful to you.

21:25.353 --> 21:27.273
He's having an affair with me.

21:31.633 --> 21:33.993
Well, I think I'll have some,
anyhow.

21:40.033 --> 21:42.233
Is that all you can say?

21:42.273 --> 21:44.873
Well, this news isn't a surprise
to me.

21:44.913 --> 21:47.993
I knew from the moment
I first saw you two together.

21:48.993 --> 21:54.113
But the fact that you are here,
telling me about it...

21:54.153 --> 21:56.193
Well, that is of interest.

21:56.233 --> 22:00.033
It suggests that
it's almost certainly over.

22:04.233 --> 22:06.513
You're so cold.

22:06.553 --> 22:09.633
No wonder Harry looks for
his passions elsewhere.

22:09.673 --> 22:12.193
You've got him bad, haven't you?

22:14.153 --> 22:15.833
He loves me.

22:15.873 --> 22:17.833
Mm, I very much doubt that.

22:17.873 --> 22:20.513
Harry has had many similar liaisons.

22:20.553 --> 22:22.633
You are the latest

22:22.673 --> 22:26.753
in a long line of chorus girls.

22:27.913 --> 22:29.593
I'm not a chorus girl!

22:29.633 --> 22:32.993
That, I admit, could be
a mistake on my husband's part.

22:33.033 --> 22:36.513
Unless there is anything else...

22:38.713 --> 22:41.113
..today is my housekeeping day.

22:45.233 --> 22:48.273
Oh, Miss Love was just leaving,
Fraser.

22:48.313 --> 22:50.353
And I'll have a coffee please.

22:56.593 --> 22:58.513
Tell him I came.

22:58.553 --> 23:00.953
And I will not be got rid of
that easily.

23:34.770 --> 23:36.490
Is the chief in?

23:37.850 --> 23:39.530
How's his mood?

23:40.090 --> 23:42.970
My mood is just fine, Mr Grove.
Why? What's the problem?

23:52.207 --> 23:54.007
Thieving in the loading bay?

23:54.047 --> 23:56.287
What the hell
is wrong with this store?

23:56.327 --> 23:58.807
Catch them red-handed
and throw them out on their ear.

23:58.847 --> 24:00.527
How did you discover this?

24:00.567 --> 24:02.687
Victor Colleano,
a waiter in the Palm Court,

24:02.727 --> 24:04.447
came to me, voiced his suspicions.

24:04.487 --> 24:06.247
Well, at least there's some loyalty.

24:06.287 --> 24:08.327
I'll deal with it, Mr Selfridge.

24:11.087 --> 24:12.767
Oh, and Mr Grove...

24:12.807 --> 24:14.807
Miss Towler is back on the pay roll.

24:14.847 --> 24:17.127
But she left.

24:17.167 --> 24:19.087
If she hadn't,
I'd have dismissed her.

24:19.127 --> 24:21.047
That would have been a mistake.

24:21.087 --> 24:23.207
Her father behaved disgracefully.

24:23.247 --> 24:27.287
The parent is not the child.
Not in my store anyway.

24:27.327 --> 24:30.527
So am I to allow Miss Bunting
to return,

24:30.567 --> 24:32.887
and turn a blind eye to
these loading bay workers?

24:32.927 --> 24:34.847
That is different.
They stole from us.

24:36.247 --> 24:39.287
The staff will not understand
why she has been allowed to return.

24:39.327 --> 24:41.407
Well, then I will explain it.

24:41.447 --> 24:43.167
Call a staff meeting this evening.

24:43.207 --> 24:45.207
Let the heads of each department
know.

24:53.327 --> 24:55.607
George, load that stuff
an' all.

24:58.567 --> 25:01.327
George, I need to talk to you,
urgent! What are you doing?

25:03.807 --> 25:06.167
What are you doing?
It's a fiddle. Don't you get it?

25:07.487 --> 25:09.167
Bloody hell!

25:09.207 --> 25:13.247
That is the property of Mr Harry
Selfridge! Out on your ear! Get out!

25:13.287 --> 25:14.967
I've been loading that van!

25:15.007 --> 25:18.007
Don't say anything. If anyone
asks, keep your mouth shut.

25:18.927 --> 25:21.847
And I thought Alf was my friend.
I'll be your friend, alright?

25:22.807 --> 25:25.127
Thanks, Victor.
But you need to wise up.

25:25.167 --> 25:27.087
Your sister's out of a job,
feeling cut up.

25:27.127 --> 25:29.687
She's ain't out of a job no more!
She found something?

25:29.727 --> 25:32.967
She's back here, isn't she?
She's back at Selfridges.

25:33.607 --> 25:35.967
I want to put a whole family
in it.

25:36.007 --> 25:38.087
Father, mother, children.

25:38.127 --> 25:42.807
And the motor will be at an angle,
so it is almost flying.

25:42.847 --> 25:45.727
You know for the children,
it has to be like a fairy tale.

25:45.767 --> 25:49.647
They are going to the park, straw
hats, which they wave in the air.

25:49.687 --> 25:51.567
Scarves, flowing out behind them.

25:51.607 --> 25:53.327
A sailor suit for the boy.

25:53.367 --> 25:55.447
A little white pinafore
for the girl.

25:57.367 --> 25:59.287
It's going to be beautiful!

26:00.207 --> 26:02.007
I'm glad you're back.

26:03.887 --> 26:05.807
This could be an exciting time
for you.

26:05.847 --> 26:08.007
Mr Selfridge has brought you
back personally.

26:08.047 --> 26:11.847
Mr Selfridge is THE best man
in the world!

26:11.887 --> 26:13.567
He is?

26:13.607 --> 26:16.127
He hasn't just given me my job back.

26:16.167 --> 26:19.887
He's, erm... He's persuaded my dad
to leave town.

26:20.807 --> 26:22.687
I can't tell you
how good that feels.

26:25.887 --> 26:28.367
You know, the world is opening up
to you.

26:29.367 --> 26:32.727
There is so much to learn,
if you reach out and take it.

27:00.287 --> 27:03.887
So, Miss Love's day is over.

27:05.527 --> 27:08.847
The question is -
who will take her place?

27:10.447 --> 27:12.767
He overrides
every decision I make.

27:12.807 --> 27:15.007
I'm his Chief of Staff!
In an emergency,

27:15.047 --> 27:17.807
I would take over running the store.
But he doesn't value me.

27:17.847 --> 27:19.727
Roger, I'm sure
that's just not true.

27:20.847 --> 27:23.687
Perhaps it is I
who should tender my resignation.

27:23.727 --> 27:25.567
No, you mustn't!

27:26.967 --> 27:29.407
You're the only one
who really understands me.

27:29.447 --> 27:31.167
Miss Mardle.

27:31.207 --> 27:34.167
Lady Loxley.

27:35.087 --> 27:36.967
How can I help you today?

27:37.807 --> 27:40.767
I'd like to see your collection
of foot muffs, for motoring.

27:40.807 --> 27:42.487
Very good!
Thank you!

27:42.527 --> 27:44.407
Staff meeting, 6 o'clock, downstairs.

27:44.447 --> 27:47.687
Mr Selfridge.
Lady Mae, what a pleasure!

27:48.847 --> 27:50.527
Tony Travers.

27:50.647 --> 27:52.727
How's the family?
How's the charming Rosalie?

27:52.767 --> 27:55.887
Oh, she's well, thank you.
Good. And dear Mrs Selfridge?

27:55.927 --> 27:57.607
Oh, she's well too.

27:57.647 --> 28:00.247
I didn't know you wife was
the artistic sort, Selfridge.

28:00.287 --> 28:02.447
I saw her at the Chelsea Arts Club
the other day.

28:02.487 --> 28:05.167
She was having a pretty good time
with Roddy Temple.

28:06.287 --> 28:08.607
He's been painting
a portrait of Rose.

28:08.647 --> 28:10.527
Oh, how wonderful.

28:10.567 --> 28:12.687
I didn't get a chance to thank you -

28:12.727 --> 28:14.607
He's a Bohemian sort of chap,

28:14.647 --> 28:17.447
and The Arts Club
is a pretty racy place.

28:17.487 --> 28:19.687
I wasn't expecting to see
Mrs Selfridge there.

28:19.727 --> 28:22.567
Tony, you are so behind the times.

28:23.407 --> 28:26.007
Since the Duchess of Rutland
started to frequent it,

28:26.047 --> 28:28.687
everyone who's anyone
wants to be seen there.

28:28.727 --> 28:31.327
How clever of Mrs Selfridge
to gain entrance.

28:31.367 --> 28:33.047
And now, if you'll excuse me.

28:38.807 --> 28:40.727
That was childish.

28:40.767 --> 28:42.607
Well, I enjoyed myself.

28:42.647 --> 28:46.207
If you're going to do something
like that, tell me first.

28:48.247 --> 28:50.447
Aren't I even allowed
to think for myself?

28:50.487 --> 28:52.287
No! That's not the point of you
at all.

28:52.327 --> 28:55.567
In fact I'm no longer sure
what the point is.

28:57.887 --> 28:59.607
Well then, if you'll excuse me.

29:14.967 --> 29:16.887
You're a man of many talents.

29:16.927 --> 29:19.967
You can't want to work here forever.
Do you have ambitions?

29:21.167 --> 29:23.327
I want to open my own restaurant
in Soho.

29:23.367 --> 29:26.207
I have friends and some influence.

29:26.247 --> 29:29.007
I also have a chef
with whooping cough.

29:29.047 --> 29:30.807
Come and cook for me this evening.

29:30.847 --> 29:33.367
We could perhaps discuss this matter
further?

29:44.127 --> 29:46.647
What an interesting painting
of Mrs Selfridge.

30:18.847 --> 30:20.847
Miss Blenkinsop!

30:20.887 --> 30:23.367
I'd like 40 white roses
sent round to my wife.

30:23.407 --> 30:25.247
No, make it 50.

30:33.607 --> 30:35.287
I thought we decided yesterday,

30:35.327 --> 30:37.447
it was a good thing
you don't work here - for us.

30:37.487 --> 30:39.767
Mr Selfridge came over himself.

30:39.807 --> 30:43.767
He asked me back,
gave me a ride in his motor!

30:43.807 --> 30:46.887
Victor, I've never felt so proud!

30:48.527 --> 30:51.687
I suppose we can court anyway,
on the quiet.

30:54.887 --> 30:56.927
Come on, get your coat.
Let's get out of here.

30:56.967 --> 30:59.007
Oh, Mr Selfridge is giving a talk.

30:59.047 --> 31:00.807
He won't miss us.

31:00.847 --> 31:02.807
I have to stay.

31:03.887 --> 31:07.327
After, then.
How about I take you out for a meal?

31:07.367 --> 31:10.287
My uncle's got this place in
Clerkenwell. I can't, not tonight.

31:10.327 --> 31:13.687
I said to Mr Leclair that I'd
help with the window for tomorrow.

31:14.927 --> 31:17.887
That man snaps his fingers,
you come running.

31:19.087 --> 31:20.807
I want to be with you.

31:21.687 --> 31:24.847
I want that too.
But I promised Mr Leclair.

31:24.887 --> 31:29.647
If I let him down, it'd be as if
I was letting Mr Selfridge down.

31:29.687 --> 31:31.367
What about letting me down?

31:31.407 --> 31:33.327
You'll say anything to get your way.

31:34.847 --> 31:37.767
You know, I'm fed up
of being told what to do.

31:37.807 --> 31:39.607
I'm not telling you what to do.

31:42.727 --> 31:45.927
You have to wear white
to be presented, Lady Mae says.

31:45.967 --> 31:48.007
All the young girls do.

31:49.047 --> 31:51.247
This one's pretty, don't you think?

31:51.287 --> 31:53.487
I'm not sure about the train.

31:53.527 --> 31:55.207
You must have a train!

31:55.247 --> 31:58.127
And I have to get used to them.
When I eventually get presented,

31:58.167 --> 32:01.807
the train has to be no less
than three yards in length
from the shoulders.

32:01.847 --> 32:03.767
It sounds rather ornate.

32:03.807 --> 32:05.487
It's tradition.

32:07.327 --> 32:09.007
For you, Mrs Selfridge.

32:10.007 --> 32:11.847
Oh!

32:16.327 --> 32:19.327
White roses, they are so beautiful!

32:21.407 --> 32:23.087
From Harry?

32:25.647 --> 32:29.167
Thank you, Fraser. Will you put them
in water? I'll arrange them later.

32:29.207 --> 32:30.967
How lovely they are!

32:32.407 --> 32:34.887
I hope I find a husband like Pa.

32:54.678 --> 32:56.798
I wanted to talk to you
about something

32:56.868 --> 32:59.028
that's very important to me.

32:59.068 --> 33:01.068
Honesty.

33:01.108 --> 33:03.628
We believe in upright behaviour
in this store.

33:03.668 --> 33:05.948
Every customer can trust

33:05.988 --> 33:08.308
they are getting exactly
what they're paying for.

33:08.348 --> 33:10.508
They make a lovely couple,
don't they?

33:10.548 --> 33:12.468
I am proud of that!

33:12.508 --> 33:14.228
I hope you are proud too.

33:15.308 --> 33:17.868
But even here, standards can slip.

33:18.908 --> 33:21.908
You steal from this store,
you steal from yourselves.

33:23.148 --> 33:26.228
Now, you all probably know
I started off as an errand boy.

33:26.268 --> 33:29.108
I was ten years old,
I earned a dollar fifty a week.

33:29.148 --> 33:32.948
The day they promoted me to
stock boy, I damn near cried.

33:32.988 --> 33:35.028
And then when they gave me the key

33:35.068 --> 33:37.628
to open up the store
in the morning...

33:37.668 --> 33:41.268
that's the day that I...
I won't forget.

33:41.308 --> 33:43.828
The manager trusted me.

33:43.868 --> 33:47.628
Without trust,
you can't run anything.

33:49.788 --> 33:52.068
I guess what I'm trying to say is,

33:52.108 --> 33:55.268
I won't tolerate dishonesty.

33:57.028 --> 34:00.148
But I'm here for you,
if you need my help.

34:02.188 --> 34:06.868
Recently, a member of our staff
thought she had to leave her position

34:06.908 --> 34:09.428
because a member of her family
behaved foolishly.

34:09.467 --> 34:15.027
Now, it wasn't her fault, so
I refused to accept her resignation.

34:15.068 --> 34:19.068
I would have done the same for
any of you in the same situation.

34:19.108 --> 34:24.908
If you are in trouble,
come to me, don't steal from me.

34:26.148 --> 34:28.348
Honest endeavour, together.

34:28.388 --> 34:32.547
This is the Spirit of Selfridge's.

35:03.348 --> 35:06.308
Your ladyship,
Mr Colleano to see you.

35:06.348 --> 35:08.308
I'd given up on you.

35:08.348 --> 35:12.108
Shame. I've got some
spatch-cock quail in here.

35:14.388 --> 35:17.068
You've brought spatch-cock quail
into my sitting room?!

35:17.108 --> 35:19.228
Thought I'd serve it up
with a salsa verde.

35:19.268 --> 35:21.068
But if you don't want it...

35:22.108 --> 35:23.908
Well, you're here now.

35:23.948 --> 35:26.068
Show Mr Colleano the kitchen.

35:30.628 --> 35:32.748
Brooooom!

35:32.788 --> 35:34.468
Hey, Pa!

35:35.668 --> 35:38.268
Is the motor in the window yet?
Going in tomorrow.

35:38.308 --> 35:40.068
Can I come see it?
You sure can.

35:40.108 --> 35:41.788
See ya!
Alright!

35:43.868 --> 35:48.628
Humphrey was now after something
else. He had made several traps -

35:50.708 --> 35:53.628
Did you like the flowers?
I loved them.

35:53.668 --> 35:56.108
I meant every word of the message.

35:57.508 --> 36:00.308
You're blushing.
I am not!

36:00.348 --> 36:03.348
Not like you did when
the painter man kissed you.

36:03.388 --> 36:05.628
Then you went really red.

36:19.748 --> 36:22.028
You're a good cook.

36:22.068 --> 36:24.268
Sit down.

36:24.308 --> 36:26.308
Help yourself to a glass of wine.

36:35.708 --> 36:39.228
So Mr Colleano...
Or may I call you...? Victor.

36:40.788 --> 36:46.108
Victor. Tell me all about yourself.
Start from the beginning.

37:07.628 --> 37:09.788
It suits you.

37:11.148 --> 37:13.268
You should wear more colour.

37:14.108 --> 37:15.788
Mr Leclair!

37:15.828 --> 37:19.748
I'd like to give it to you
for all your hard work tonight.

37:19.788 --> 37:21.548
I couldn't accept this!

37:21.588 --> 37:25.028
Take it. I'll pay for it tomorrow.

37:26.068 --> 37:27.748
Goodnight.

37:27.788 --> 37:29.788
Thank you.

37:33.068 --> 37:34.748
Good night.

38:21.388 --> 38:23.108
Oh no, you don't!

38:24.108 --> 38:26.188
We need to have this out.

38:26.228 --> 38:29.828
It's bad enough that you kiss him
in this house -

38:29.868 --> 38:32.708
but you do it in front of Beatrice!

38:32.748 --> 38:34.708
Her own mother.

38:34.748 --> 38:36.988
And then, you lied to me.

38:37.028 --> 38:39.468
You said that everything
was gonna be alright.

38:39.508 --> 38:43.308
But you're having an affair,
with some two-bit painter!

38:43.348 --> 38:46.588
You even sent the portrait
to my office!

38:48.708 --> 38:50.828
What's happened to you, Rose?

38:50.868 --> 38:53.868
Ellen Love paid me a visit
this morning.

38:55.428 --> 38:58.348
Ellen? What did she want?

38:59.788 --> 39:03.428
Why does it have to be one rule for
you and another for the rest of us?

39:03.468 --> 39:05.148
Whatever she said, it's not true.

39:05.188 --> 39:08.788
So you're telling me you're
not having a relationship
with Miss Love?

39:16.148 --> 39:17.908
It's over.

39:19.188 --> 39:22.828
And what about you?
Have you been with him?

39:24.428 --> 39:26.628
No.

39:26.668 --> 39:31.108
But would you blame me if I had?
I'd just be following your example.

39:31.148 --> 39:34.028
Don't say that.
All these years I have sat at home,

39:34.068 --> 39:36.468
while you've gone out
and had your fun!

39:36.508 --> 39:40.028
Do you think that
I want to be this way?

39:41.108 --> 39:43.388
Do you think that it makes me happy?

39:43.428 --> 39:45.748
Now I'm meant to feel sorry for you,
is that right?

39:45.788 --> 39:48.908
Well, maybe I will tomorrow.
But tonight - you can go to hell!

40:05.388 --> 40:07.548
Another one.

40:07.588 --> 40:09.588
Drinking, old boy?
Yeah.

40:09.668 --> 40:11.948
Not like you.
And losing too.

40:11.988 --> 40:13.828
I've lost a packet.
What can I get you?

40:13.868 --> 40:15.708
Whiskey.
Whiskey.

40:16.748 --> 40:18.428
What happened?

40:18.468 --> 40:23.068
Well... Ellen paid my wife a visit
today.

40:23.108 --> 40:24.788
Uh-oh!

40:29.668 --> 40:31.548
Rose thinks I'm no damn good.

40:32.668 --> 40:34.668
She may be right.

40:39.868 --> 40:42.028
Normally I stay off this poison.

40:45.988 --> 40:48.708
My father had a penchant for it.

40:49.508 --> 40:51.188
Really?

40:51.228 --> 40:53.348
You mother paints the Major
as a bit of a saint.

40:53.388 --> 40:58.108
Let's just say -
Ma likes to remember the good times.

41:00.268 --> 41:02.588
What are we drinking to?
Anything you like.

41:03.988 --> 41:05.668
To my father!

41:05.708 --> 41:07.388
The Major.

41:07.428 --> 41:10.348
To Pa and everything
that he stood for!

41:11.068 --> 41:12.748
Cheers.

41:17.068 --> 41:19.748
More cards, that's what I need.

41:19.788 --> 41:21.588
Shouldn't you call it a night?

41:24.228 --> 41:25.908
Mr Selfridge?
Yeah.

41:25.948 --> 41:30.268
Someone to see you.
I'm sorry, I couldn't stop her.

41:39.948 --> 41:41.628
What are you doing here?

41:46.108 --> 41:49.668
I told your wife,
and I'll tell you -

41:50.668 --> 41:54.948
I won't be cast off
like a piece of nothing.

41:54.988 --> 41:58.348
You're doped up and you're not
thinking straight. Just go home.

41:59.188 --> 42:01.388
The flat's not the same without you.

42:04.148 --> 42:07.828
Please, Harry. Come with me.

42:08.668 --> 42:10.348
One last time.

42:11.548 --> 42:14.308
I'm sorry if I misled you,
I really am.

42:14.348 --> 42:17.388
But you have to understand,
I have a family.

42:22.628 --> 42:24.908
You're just the same
as all the others!

42:26.668 --> 42:29.988
You are a whore mongering,
low-life bastard!

42:30.028 --> 42:32.348
Time to go, old thing. Time to go.

42:32.388 --> 42:35.348
Please don't do this to me, Harry.
I love you. Come on!

42:35.388 --> 42:37.348
I love you.
Let's go.

42:57.428 --> 42:59.108
Thank you, son.

43:01.908 --> 43:04.788
Harry, old chap? I put her in a cab.

43:04.828 --> 43:07.188
I'll go and check on her later,
see she's all right.

43:08.188 --> 43:09.988
Go home. Get some sleep.

43:35.748 --> 43:38.068
'I've got a secret
that I can't tell you!'

43:51.028 --> 43:52.788
Ellen?

44:00.108 --> 44:01.828
Ellen?

44:16.308 --> 44:17.988
Jesus!

44:27.388 --> 44:30.948
Harry. You came.

44:37.108 --> 44:39.068
Come on, let's get you up.

45:03.028 --> 45:05.028
'Your father's no war hero.'

45:08.908 --> 45:11.708
'I can't seem to find my way
out of it.'

45:13.868 --> 45:16.348
'Dad, you're nothing
but a common huckster.'

45:17.148 --> 45:20.868
'But I'm your blood and you're
mine whether you like it or not.'

45:20.908 --> 45:23.108
'Come with me... with me...'

45:23.148 --> 45:25.828
Not like you did
when the painter man kissed you.

45:25.868 --> 45:28.108
'All these years
I have sat at home!'

45:29.228 --> 45:30.908
'..low-life bastard!'

45:30.948 --> 45:33.508
'Have your fun!'

45:33.548 --> 45:35.908
'You're nothing
but a common huckster.'

45:39.228 --> 45:40.948
'Nothing but a common huckster.'

45:40.988 --> 45:43.268
'Who are you?'
'Who are you?'

45:58.788 --> 46:00.628
As you all must have heard
by now,

46:00.668 --> 46:03.388
the Chief had a serious
automobile accident.

46:04.748 --> 46:07.908
I am Chief Of Staff.
This ship needs a Captain.
I am that man.

46:07.988 --> 46:10.668
Taking it bad, isn't he,
your Mr Leclair?

46:10.708 --> 46:12.428
He's not MY Mr Leclair.

46:12.468 --> 46:15.148
The Suffragettes are walking past
the building tomorrow.

46:15.188 --> 46:17.268
Some of the stores
are very worried about it.

46:17.308 --> 46:19.648
They are not to set foot within
these four walls. Is that clear?

46:19.677 --> 46:21.997
We've got a real problem
on our hands tomorrow.

46:22.037 --> 46:25.517
Unless we do something about it,
the store could be in real trouble.
