00:45.879 --> 00:47.714
Tensions are rising as the stand-off

00:47.798 --> 00:51.801
between the world community and the
rogue North African nation of Wadiya

00:51.885 --> 00:53.094
intensified today

00:53.178 --> 00:57.140
as U.N. Weapons inspectors were once
again refused access to the country

00:57.224 --> 01:00.476
by Wadiyan leader,
Admiral General Aladeen.

01:00.894 --> 01:04.688
I will take no options off the
table. And I mean what I say.

01:04.897 --> 01:07.859
Tonight we ask... Who
is General Aladeen?

01:08.277 --> 01:10.069
According to Wadiyan propaganda,

01:10.154 --> 01:13.281
Haffaz Aladeen was born in 1973.

01:16.452 --> 01:19.787
He did not know his mother,
who died in childbirth.

01:21.623 --> 01:25.084
General Aladeen was born the
only son of the Colonel Aladeen,

01:25.169 --> 01:27.462
himself a savage and violent dictator.

01:31.300 --> 01:32.300
Next!

01:34.428 --> 01:36.053
Known for his iconic beard,

01:36.180 --> 01:38.639
he is protected by 30 female guards,

01:38.932 --> 01:40.641
who he maintains are virgin.

01:50.819 --> 01:52.487
Thrust into power at age seven,

01:52.613 --> 01:56.324
he may just be the most
dangerous man in the entire world.

01:57.034 --> 01:58.326
All right, let's get right to it.

01:59.620 --> 02:01.329
Do you have nuclear weapons?

02:04.208 --> 02:05.583
What was the question?

02:06.376 --> 02:09.127
Do you have nuclear weapons?

02:09.378 --> 02:10.420
Sorry, I can't hear you.

02:10.506 --> 02:12.215
Are you developing nuclear weapons?

02:12.508 --> 02:14.383
No, I literally can't hear you.

02:15.135 --> 02:17.011
I'm going to another question.

02:17.095 --> 02:19.263
Oh, I can hear you now.

02:20.015 --> 02:22.391
Eccentric and with unlimited oil wealth,

02:22.476 --> 02:24.894
he recently hosted his
own Olympic Games...

02:25.187 --> 02:27.396
On your mark, get set.

02:36.073 --> 02:38.533
...at which he won fourteen gold medals.

02:42.329 --> 02:44.372
Aladeen! Aladeen!

02:45.374 --> 02:46.707
Often described as ignorant,

02:47.251 --> 02:50.628
he changed over 300
Wadiyan words to "Aladeen,"

02:50.712 --> 02:54.507
including the words "positive" and
"negative," causing mass confusion.

02:55.217 --> 02:59.845
Do you want the Aladeen
news or the Aladeen news?

03:00.806 --> 03:03.474
The Aladeen news?

03:04.810 --> 03:07.812
You are HIV-Aladeen.

03:21.994 --> 03:23.202
With pressure mounting,

03:23.287 --> 03:25.830
Aladeen addressed his nation today.

03:26.164 --> 03:28.332
Aladeen! Aladeen!

03:59.114 --> 04:01.115
People of Wadiya,

04:01.450 --> 04:03.993
I come before you today

04:04.328 --> 04:08.706
to tell you that the world shall
kneel before our great nation.

04:08.999 --> 04:13.961
We are two months away from
enriching weapons-grade uranium

04:16.339 --> 04:21.552
to be used for peaceful purposes.

04:28.852 --> 04:32.855
It will be used only
for medical research

04:33.148 --> 04:36.317
and clean energy. It will, it will.

04:36.485 --> 04:39.153
And will certainly never be used

04:39.488 --> 04:41.989
to attack Is... Oh, boy.

04:45.661 --> 04:46.994
With that speech, today,

04:47.079 --> 04:49.664
the international community
is asking one question:

04:50.165 --> 04:53.501
Does the Mad Dog of Wadiya
have nuclear weapons?

05:04.054 --> 05:05.179
Now, show me my nuclear weapons!

05:05.263 --> 05:08.015
I can't wait! I can't wait!

05:24.116 --> 05:26.325
This is the Beard of Doom rocket?

05:26.785 --> 05:29.662
This is my weapon? I
will be a laughingstock!

05:29.955 --> 05:32.623
All my friends have got nuclear weapons.

05:32.874 --> 05:34.375
Even Ahmadinejad!

05:34.751 --> 05:37.920
And he looks like a
snitch on Miami Vice.

05:38.213 --> 05:40.548
Would it kill him to wear a tie?

05:41.049 --> 05:44.009
I mean, is every day
in Iran casual Friday?

05:44.886 --> 05:48.889
Where is the Head of my Nuclear
Program and Procurer of Women?

05:49.224 --> 05:51.058
Where is Nuclear Nadal?

05:51.309 --> 05:53.728
You had Nadal executed, Supreme Leader.

05:54.062 --> 05:55.187
Why did I do that?

06:00.986 --> 06:01.986
Supreme Leader!

06:02.237 --> 06:03.571
Nadal.

06:03.822 --> 06:06.991
We are just months away from
refining weapons-grade uranium,

06:07.242 --> 06:09.910
and we are set to test
the missile next week.

06:11.747 --> 06:14.457
It is too round on the
top. It needs to be pointy.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.752
Round is not scary. Pointy is scary.

06:18.003 --> 06:20.004
This will put a smile on
the faces of the enemy.

06:20.255 --> 06:23.591
They will think that it is a huge
robot dildo flying toward them.

06:23.842 --> 06:25.050
No, Supreme Leader.

06:25.135 --> 06:27.887
The shape of the missile top has
nothing to do with aerodynamics.

06:27.971 --> 06:29.680
It is about the payload delivery.

06:29.765 --> 06:31.932
No. It sticks in the
ground, and then kaboom.

06:32.434 --> 06:33.893
Supreme Leader, I think perhaps

06:33.977 --> 06:37.438
some of your information about
bombs is coming from cartoons.

06:37.564 --> 06:39.857
Nonsense. They were research films.

06:40.317 --> 06:42.610
And in them, the victims of the bomb

06:42.694 --> 06:44.778
would get very sooty faces

06:44.988 --> 06:47.865
and then a see-through
version of themselves

06:48.366 --> 06:51.577
started rising up towards
Heaven while playing a harp.

06:51.953 --> 06:55.039
In this film, just one question,

06:55.123 --> 06:59.043
was there a duck who, when
the explosion is happens,

06:59.127 --> 07:02.338
his bill goes around
to the back of his head,

07:02.422 --> 07:05.549
and then in order to talk, he
has to put it back this way?

07:06.009 --> 07:09.261
There was somebody who
suffered a deformity like that.

07:09.346 --> 07:10.596
Okay.

07:10.680 --> 07:14.016
I am now 100 % sure that
you are watching cartoons.

07:14.392 --> 07:16.310
Have you spoken to
the experts about this?

07:16.394 --> 07:19.313
- Have you consulted Professor Bobeye?
- Who?

07:19.397 --> 07:22.816
Professor Bobeye, the one with
the incredibly strong forearms

07:22.901 --> 07:24.944
that are miss-sized for his body.

07:25.153 --> 07:27.446
The man you are discussing
is called Popeye.

07:27.572 --> 07:29.490
- Bobeye.
- He is not a professor.

07:29.616 --> 07:33.369
Popeye is, as the song
tells us, a sailor man.

07:34.496 --> 07:37.248
Indulge me. For one second,
pretend that I'm an idiot.

07:37.332 --> 07:38.374
Okay. I'm there.

07:38.458 --> 07:41.669
And explain to me how this bomb

07:41.878 --> 07:44.547
will not land in Israel

07:44.839 --> 07:48.342
and then, literally, bounce
right back and blow up Wadiya.

07:48.760 --> 07:50.302
Supreme Leader, let me explain to you.

07:50.428 --> 07:51.512
You've lost me.

07:53.515 --> 07:54.890
This is the missile in Wadiya,

07:55.517 --> 07:57.685
you push the button, "Boop!"

08:01.273 --> 08:02.273
Israel...

08:06.403 --> 08:08.946
"No! Why?"

08:12.117 --> 08:13.242
Nuclear winter.

08:13.618 --> 08:14.702
The reality is...

08:19.541 --> 08:20.541
Oy vey!

08:22.919 --> 08:23.919
Us.

08:26.506 --> 08:29.842
Believe me, sir, if I could make
the device even a little more pointy,

08:29.926 --> 08:32.428
I would, but I simply cannot.

08:35.515 --> 08:37.515
Okay. You know what?

08:38.518 --> 08:40.311
Let's just agree to disagree, my friend.

08:40.645 --> 08:41.729
Okay.

08:43.982 --> 08:45.316
What? Why? No!

08:46.192 --> 08:48.402
- Don't you remember?
- Of course I remember!

08:48.695 --> 08:51.655
How dare you question my
memory? I remember everything!

08:51.740 --> 08:54.575
No, I would never do that! Never!
I'm so sorry. I didn't mean that.

08:54.868 --> 08:57.286
Don't worry, it's fine.
Well done, my friend.

08:57.579 --> 08:58.746
Thank you.

09:00.206 --> 09:01.540
Wait! Wait! Where are we going?

09:01.750 --> 09:04.752
Admiral General, what if we
just tell the United Nations

09:04.836 --> 09:06.170
we have no nuclear weapons?

09:06.254 --> 09:07.630
They will lift the sanctions.

09:07.714 --> 09:09.965
We'll be free to sell oil
rights to the Jalabiya desert.

09:10.050 --> 09:11.634
Uncle Tamir.

09:11.718 --> 09:13.927
Do you not remember
what my saintly father

09:14.012 --> 09:15.888
made me promise him on his deathbed?

09:16.389 --> 09:19.558
It was never to sell Wadiya's oil.

09:20.560 --> 09:22.603
You remember that was
when he gave me power

09:22.687 --> 09:24.647
instead of you, the rightful heir.

09:24.898 --> 09:26.398
You've been so cool about it.

09:27.442 --> 09:28.776
Now, let's go back to the palace.

09:29.027 --> 09:30.235
It's the season finale

09:30.320 --> 09:34.031
of Real Housewives of
Shachahmahahfalimitahlicch!

09:36.201 --> 09:38.702
Aladeen! Aladeen!

09:55.136 --> 09:56.762
Death to the tyrant!

10:07.732 --> 10:09.733
Looks like we need to find a new double.

10:10.068 --> 10:11.402
Because this one is...

10:11.736 --> 10:14.446
You know, I don't know if
he's going to get better.

10:14.781 --> 10:16.824
Oh, he's not going to
recover, sir. He's dead.

10:17.575 --> 10:20.786
Send his wife some
chocolate covered almond nuts

10:20.870 --> 10:23.789
in a cellophane wrapped box. Delicious.

10:24.165 --> 10:27.918
We're going to send
your wife some almonds.

10:28.044 --> 10:30.212
Chocolate covered versions of these.

10:33.508 --> 10:37.344
Maroush, I think I dropped
an almond in his head.

10:37.429 --> 10:38.846
Can you take it out?

10:39.514 --> 10:42.725
What I don't want to do is
send the body to the family

10:42.809 --> 10:45.519
and then they discover
an almond in his head,

10:45.603 --> 10:47.980
and they say, "Why is there
an almond in his head?"

10:48.064 --> 10:49.231
Take it out.

10:51.401 --> 10:52.526
Clean it!

10:53.319 --> 10:54.611
How am I gonna eat that?

10:57.574 --> 10:59.408
- Don't eat it.
- Oh, Maroush!

11:00.535 --> 11:02.703
Listen, everything
is gonna be just fine.

11:02.871 --> 11:04.580
I don't want you to
worry about anything.

11:05.373 --> 11:07.875
Yeah, how 'bout looking in my
eye when I'm speaking to you?

11:07.959 --> 11:11.795
It's very rude not to look at somebody
in the eye when they're talking to you.

11:13.173 --> 11:14.882
It's okay. Don't worry.
You're having a rough day.

11:24.976 --> 11:27.227
We shot the wrong man.

11:27.479 --> 11:30.856
I can fix this. I have a new
plan. We need to find a new double.

11:30.940 --> 11:33.901
One that is simple enough
to be manipulated completely.

11:48.917 --> 11:50.918
I think we found what
you are looking for.

12:00.094 --> 12:02.471
You think this man looks like me?

12:02.931 --> 12:05.265
You have a very big barn.

12:05.600 --> 12:09.061
You must have many happy goats, hmm?

12:09.270 --> 12:11.480
What the fuck does that even mean?

12:12.774 --> 12:16.068
Uncle Tamir, this thing is an idiot.

12:16.277 --> 12:18.070
What makes you think he can do the job?

12:18.404 --> 12:22.074
May I remind you that his only
real job is to be shot in the head.

12:22.575 --> 12:25.410
Very well. Put him
through the process, okay?

12:26.162 --> 12:28.205
Clip his nails, file his teeth,

12:28.289 --> 12:31.083
bleach his skin, and shorten the penis.

12:35.421 --> 12:37.422
Megan! Megan!

12:38.591 --> 12:40.425
You now have herpes.

12:43.263 --> 12:45.847
Megan, you were worth every penny.

12:46.182 --> 12:47.683
You were super hot.

12:48.017 --> 12:49.268
Is my jet ready?

12:49.394 --> 12:52.437
Yes, but do you want to stay the night?

12:52.522 --> 12:54.273
You know, I really want
to do some cuddling.

12:54.357 --> 12:55.524
No. Your time is up.

12:55.608 --> 12:57.609
I have to be with the Italian
Prime Minister tomorrow.

12:57.944 --> 13:00.320
Okay. Maroush, give the goodie bag!

13:00.738 --> 13:01.738
Thanks.

13:01.823 --> 13:03.240
I trust everything is in there,

13:03.324 --> 13:05.033
as your manager requested?

13:05.118 --> 13:07.202
Katy Perry said she got a diamond Rolex.

13:07.287 --> 13:09.955
That's because she let
me Aladeen in her face.

13:12.959 --> 13:13.959
Okay.

13:14.043 --> 13:16.295
Right. Are you sure you don't
want to stay for some cuddles?

13:16.379 --> 13:17.379
- No.
- But, please.

13:17.463 --> 13:18.964
I really want someone to cuddle.

14:22.528 --> 14:25.197
Breaking news now. Just moments ago,

14:25.281 --> 14:26.448
the U.N. Security Council voted

14:26.532 --> 14:28.909
to authorize NATO air
strikes against Wadiya,

14:28.993 --> 14:33.205
unless Admiral General Aladeen
agrees to address the U.N. In person.

14:33.289 --> 14:35.207
And now, the world waits.

14:35.291 --> 14:36.541
What will Aladeen do next?

14:56.938 --> 15:01.149
Next. No, no, no. No. Boring,
boring. Come on. Come on.

15:01.234 --> 15:04.611
Beloved Oppressor, I have
just received disturbing news.

15:04.696 --> 15:07.030
Welcome to the Munich Olympics.

15:07.532 --> 15:08.699
Shalom?

15:09.867 --> 15:11.034
Oy vey!

15:11.285 --> 15:12.786
Supreme Leader,

15:12.870 --> 15:14.162
the United Nations demands that

15:14.247 --> 15:17.541
you address their concerns
about our nuclear program,

15:17.625 --> 15:19.793
or they will vote to
authorize military action.

15:20.628 --> 15:21.795
Summon my generals.

15:22.004 --> 15:23.630
I'll join you after I finish this level.

15:23.840 --> 15:25.632
Bonus round. Mass grave.

15:38.521 --> 15:42.566
Those gangsters at the UN
want me to address them.

15:42.817 --> 15:46.611
Fine! I'll address them like
they've never been addressed before.

15:46.821 --> 15:48.071
How much time have they allotted me?

15:48.656 --> 15:49.740
Seven minutes, sir.

15:49.949 --> 15:52.534
I'll talk for 14 hours!

15:53.077 --> 15:55.746
And three of those
will be untranslatable.

15:55.872 --> 15:57.247
Literally, baby noises.

16:00.960 --> 16:03.545
Okay. Let's rehearse
this. Role play, role play.

16:03.671 --> 16:05.672
You, come on. This'll be fun.

16:05.840 --> 16:08.800
So, Secretary General,
your soldiers will weep...

16:10.762 --> 16:13.472
I'm so sorry! Listen,
it was not my fault.

16:13.556 --> 16:16.099
I mean, somebody had
set the safety catch

16:16.184 --> 16:18.018
to "Aladeen" instead of "Aladeen."

16:18.603 --> 16:20.353
Look, I mean, this whole gun...

16:21.731 --> 16:23.523
It's gonna be fine.
You just need to ice it.

16:23.858 --> 16:25.066
You got to ice.

16:25.485 --> 16:26.735
Promise me you're going to ice?

16:26.986 --> 16:28.111
Okay. Tamir!

16:28.863 --> 16:30.614
Inflate my neck pillow

16:30.698 --> 16:34.075
and pack my book of
medium-level Sudoku.

16:34.577 --> 16:37.329
We're going to America!

17:04.106 --> 17:05.482
America!

17:05.858 --> 17:09.069
The birthplace of AIDS.

17:12.824 --> 17:17.243
Supreme Leader, I took the liberty
of hiring some extra security.

17:17.328 --> 17:18.829
This is Mr. Clayton.

17:18.913 --> 17:22.040
Admiral General, I am here
for your protection 24/7.

17:22.124 --> 17:23.208
Okay.

17:23.291 --> 17:26.877
But in the interest of full
disclosure, I have to say I hate A-rabs.

17:27.755 --> 17:29.881
Well, that's fine,
because I'm not an Arab.

17:30.591 --> 17:33.927
Well, you're all A-rabs to
me, the blacks, the Jews,

17:34.011 --> 17:36.763
those blue tree-hugging
queers in A-vatar.

17:39.267 --> 17:42.769
In fact, anyone from outside of
America is technically an A-rab.

17:43.896 --> 17:45.021
Listen, while you're here,

17:45.106 --> 17:48.400
I highly recommend a visit
to the Empire State Building,

17:48.484 --> 17:51.570
before you or one of your
sand-monkey cousins takes it down.

17:52.238 --> 17:55.699
Also, if you're interested in taking
in a Broadway show while you're here,

17:55.950 --> 17:57.492
and you don't mind the homo stuff,

17:57.785 --> 17:59.828
I highly recommend Billy Elliot.

18:00.913 --> 18:03.415
You know what, I like this
guy despite his liberal views.

18:03.499 --> 18:04.708
Very good, sir.

18:09.797 --> 18:13.592
Supreme Leader, the suite has been
renovated to your specifications.

18:19.098 --> 18:22.267
Twenty dollars a day for
Internet? What the fuck?

18:23.603 --> 18:27.314
And they accuse me of being
an international criminal?

18:28.774 --> 18:30.567
Beloved Oppressor,
try to get some sleep.

18:30.651 --> 18:32.277
Tomorrow is your big speech.

18:32.486 --> 18:35.363
Nobody touch the minibar!
It's a fucking rip-off!

18:55.176 --> 18:56.927
Rise and shine.

18:58.179 --> 18:59.179
Who are you?

18:59.639 --> 19:01.848
We've actually already met.

19:02.433 --> 19:03.516
Hello, Aladdin.

19:04.018 --> 19:05.769
Clayton? I thought we were friends.

19:07.021 --> 19:08.355
Nice to see you, too.

19:09.857 --> 19:11.024
Here's the deal.

19:11.150 --> 19:13.360
I'm gonna kill you, and then
I'm gonna burn your body.

19:13.527 --> 19:14.569
No, no, no. Please, don't.

19:14.654 --> 19:18.823
But before I do I have one
very important question for you.

19:19.575 --> 19:21.576
Did you get a chance
to see Billy Elliot?

19:23.162 --> 19:24.162
Yes.

19:24.288 --> 19:25.372
And?

19:25.581 --> 19:28.208
I found it heartwarming
and life-affirming.

19:29.627 --> 19:32.045
Thank you! How great is that show?

19:32.213 --> 19:33.630
It is. It's great, yeah.

19:33.714 --> 19:36.216
You know, he's got like
an artist inside himself,

19:36.425 --> 19:40.053
but he's in this working class
place and no one understands him.

19:40.137 --> 19:43.139
He's just like... I'm gonna
express myself in my dance.

19:43.307 --> 19:44.641
And he expresses himself...

19:45.393 --> 19:48.770
And he doesn't wanna use violence, but
he puts his violence into his dance.

19:49.063 --> 19:50.146
You should try that.

19:51.440 --> 19:54.651
Okay. So, we gotta get down
to business. Enough chit-chat.

19:54.735 --> 19:56.236
I'm being paid to kill you.

19:56.570 --> 19:58.029
But I'm gonna torture you for free.

20:02.868 --> 20:04.160
Are you serious?

20:04.412 --> 20:05.578
Where'd you get those relics?

20:05.663 --> 20:08.248
From the Shah of Iran's garage sale?

20:08.666 --> 20:09.666
Yeah, right.

20:09.750 --> 20:11.167
I mean, I know there's
nothing more annoying

20:11.252 --> 20:12.752
than a backseat torturer,
but, please, come on.

20:13.087 --> 20:14.421
This is great stuff.

20:14.505 --> 20:17.924
It's not great stuff.
That's like 1972, hello.

20:19.677 --> 20:23.179
You won't be talking so much
smack with this up your butt.

20:23.764 --> 20:26.850
That's the Anal Umbrella. It's
a good device, I grant you,

20:26.934 --> 20:28.852
but where's the splash guard?

20:28.936 --> 20:30.895
You're going to kill
me and your white shirt.

20:31.230 --> 20:32.939
It didn't come with a splash guard.

20:33.024 --> 20:35.025
You're gonna get chara on your trousers.

20:35.359 --> 20:37.193
I can see it has a screw hole for one.

20:37.278 --> 20:38.695
Apparently, I didn't get it.

20:39.238 --> 20:41.072
All right, Mr. Smart Guy,

20:41.282 --> 20:43.366
check out this bad boy.

20:43.451 --> 20:45.910
Oh, that's not bad. The
Kandahar Cock Wrench.

20:45.995 --> 20:47.370
Okay, so, now we're getting somewhere.

20:47.455 --> 20:50.290
It's actually been banned in
Saudi Arabia for being too safe.

20:51.417 --> 20:53.793
You know, this is totally depressing.

20:54.086 --> 20:55.462
Listen, just show me another one.

20:55.546 --> 20:58.298
You know, honestly, I don't even
want to show you anything anymore.

20:59.008 --> 21:00.300
Don't be like that.

21:00.843 --> 21:02.802
You know, I don't even think
you want to be tortured.

21:02.887 --> 21:04.220
I don't want to be tortured.

21:04.305 --> 21:05.555
You're just, like, taking
all the fun out of it!

21:05.639 --> 21:07.807
You just want me to say
compliments all the time.

21:07.975 --> 21:10.810
So either you want the truth
or you want compliments. Decide!

21:11.020 --> 21:14.397
It'd be nice if I got just a little
bit of positive feedback about my tools.

21:14.523 --> 21:16.357
What else you got? I'm
gonna love the next thing!

21:16.442 --> 21:17.567
I will be supportive.

21:17.818 --> 21:19.152
All right.

21:19.695 --> 21:22.030
Just this. This pours
hot fire out on you.

21:22.281 --> 21:24.199
Oh, the Fallujah Firehose!

21:24.283 --> 21:26.034
Someone's got a friend in Syria!

21:26.118 --> 21:27.577
I am pretty proud of it.

21:27.661 --> 21:29.245
There is a new model, you know.

21:30.456 --> 21:31.790
I've got one that works by Bluetooth.

21:33.751 --> 21:35.418
Screw it. Screw it! Screw it!

21:35.753 --> 21:37.045
I'm going to enjoy this now.

21:37.129 --> 21:38.880
No, don't. Don't. Don't. Please, don't!

21:46.889 --> 21:50.308
No one will recognize
the body without this!

21:50.559 --> 21:52.811
The Supreme Beard! You will be cursed!

21:52.937 --> 21:54.020
No, no, don't do it!

21:54.104 --> 21:55.897
Come on! Why won't this catch?

21:55.981 --> 21:59.818
You foolish man! There is no
earthly fire that could ever light...

22:01.278 --> 22:04.113
The flames of the
righteous attack the unjust!

22:13.457 --> 22:16.876
I'll be back with help!
J. K! Just kidding!

22:22.049 --> 22:23.716
My speech.

22:25.386 --> 22:28.555
Yo! Average American shopper!

22:29.098 --> 22:30.723
I do not have any money on me,

22:30.975 --> 22:32.183
but if you give me your clothes

22:32.268 --> 22:35.395
I'll make a sizeable donation
in your name to al-Qaeda.

22:40.693 --> 22:47.615
Hey, hey, oh, oh! Aladeen has got to go!

22:49.285 --> 22:51.286
Hello. I am Admiral General Aladeen.

22:51.370 --> 22:53.580
I am here to deliver my
speech to the United Nations.

22:53.664 --> 22:55.498
Look, Admiral, it's too hot for crazy.

22:55.749 --> 22:56.791
How dare you?

22:56.959 --> 22:59.002
Listen, Tamir is coming right now.

22:59.253 --> 23:01.421
You're going to be in
big trouble. Here he is.

23:01.881 --> 23:03.214
Tamir! Tamir!

23:12.224 --> 23:14.350
Tamir, it was you, you snake!

23:16.228 --> 23:19.898
He's not the legitimate leader!

23:19.982 --> 23:21.816
He's not the legitimate leader!

23:21.901 --> 23:25.153
He's not the legitimate leader!

23:26.655 --> 23:29.490
You have rehearsed the
speech I prepared for you?

23:29.575 --> 23:32.577
Yes. But when is the General coming?

23:32.828 --> 23:33.995
He's feeling ill.

23:34.246 --> 23:36.331
Does he have worms in his shilshul?

23:36.415 --> 23:37.582
Very possibly.

23:38.167 --> 23:40.668
Admiral General Aladeen preparing

23:40.753 --> 23:42.837
to address the General
Assembly of the United Nations.

23:42.922 --> 23:43.922
An historic moment.

23:44.006 --> 23:45.673
He's approaching the podium.

23:46.008 --> 23:48.259
And he's walked right past the podium.

23:48.427 --> 23:49.427
What is he doing?

23:49.845 --> 23:51.846
You are making a fool out of me!

23:52.181 --> 23:54.182
Let's bring in Denise,
our U. N. Correspondent.

23:54.266 --> 23:55.475
What do you make of that?

23:56.268 --> 23:58.186
Well, I have to say,
he's got their attention.

23:58.520 --> 24:00.688
Every eye in the room
is on him right now.

24:00.773 --> 24:03.191
And he's returning to the podium.

24:04.109 --> 24:05.860
And he's fallen off the stage.

24:05.945 --> 24:07.612
What do you make of that, Denise?

24:07.863 --> 24:12.533
You know, he's clearly implying
that the U. N. Must fall before him.

24:12.952 --> 24:15.453
Drinking from the
pitcher of water directly,

24:15.537 --> 24:18.081
as opposed to the glass that
I'm sure must be up there.

24:18.165 --> 24:19.207
What do you think that means?

24:19.291 --> 24:21.334
Again, it's another attempt to say,

24:21.418 --> 24:23.628
"Listen, I'm not going
to play by your rules."

24:23.712 --> 24:25.380
And he seems to have
a pitcher of urine out.

24:25.881 --> 24:28.132
I believe he just
urinated in the pitcher.

24:29.885 --> 24:31.552
He is now drinking his urine.

24:31.804 --> 24:33.471
It looks to be his own urine.

24:34.014 --> 24:35.264
Sorry. You want?

24:35.516 --> 24:37.850
Trying to force it on
the Israeli delegation.

24:38.435 --> 24:39.852
That might be the ambassador.

24:40.270 --> 24:43.940
He is dumping the urine
on the Israeli delegation.

24:44.191 --> 24:45.441
Oh, that's a good one.

24:47.277 --> 24:49.112
Okay, he's returning to the podium.

24:49.613 --> 24:54.033
Much has been made of the
hostility between our countries.

24:54.535 --> 24:56.869
With the help of the U.M.,

24:57.121 --> 25:00.540
I will draft a new
constitution for Wadiya

25:00.874 --> 25:05.878
and sign it in five days,
on Wadiya's Independence Day.

25:06.213 --> 25:07.213
No, no, no.

25:07.464 --> 25:09.215
This new constitution

25:09.466 --> 25:11.092
will end the dictatorship...

25:11.176 --> 25:12.176
No!

25:12.261 --> 25:15.722
...and it will turn Wadiya into a

25:16.223 --> 25:17.557
democracy.

25:20.477 --> 25:22.895
No! Democracy? Never!

25:23.647 --> 25:24.981
Never!

25:26.150 --> 25:29.235
The Wadiyan people love being oppressed!

25:30.070 --> 25:32.530
Dictatorship forever!

25:39.872 --> 25:41.372
Come on! Come with me!

25:42.166 --> 25:43.207
Hurry!

25:48.547 --> 25:50.882
Hello, person. Person.

25:51.133 --> 25:52.467
Black person.

25:53.135 --> 25:54.802
The double that you found is good.

25:54.887 --> 25:56.637
He is almost as dumb as the real guy.

25:56.889 --> 25:59.390
So, Wadiya will become a democracy.

25:59.892 --> 26:02.060
China is a democracy, too.

26:04.063 --> 26:05.772
Once that constitution is signed,

26:05.856 --> 26:09.067
I will be able to sell
Wadiya's oil rights. Gazprom,

26:09.401 --> 26:11.694
you will have control of
Wadiya's southern oil fields.

26:11.779 --> 26:13.571
B. P., you will control the north.

26:13.655 --> 26:15.073
Exxon, you will have
all offshore rights,

26:15.157 --> 26:17.408
provided you do not use
B. P.'s drilling rigs.

26:17.493 --> 26:21.496
And, Mr. Lao of PetroChina, you will
have the lease on our shale reserves.

26:21.580 --> 26:23.539
Some of those reserves are
in densely populated areas.

26:23.916 --> 26:26.250
Then unpopulate them.

26:26.752 --> 26:29.629
After you've paid me my 30 %
finder's fee, of course.

26:30.089 --> 26:31.422
Gentlemen.

26:33.258 --> 26:35.426
So, you're going to make billions.

26:35.511 --> 26:37.512
What will you do with all those dollars?

26:37.971 --> 26:41.641
I will buy the house on Lake
Como next to George Clooney's.

26:41.892 --> 26:43.810
I love George Clooney!

26:44.144 --> 26:45.937
He's an old-fashioned movie star.

26:46.021 --> 26:47.814
He gay? He suck my dick?

26:48.607 --> 26:52.276
No, those are just rumors.
Are you a homosexual?

26:52.528 --> 26:55.113
No, no, no, it's more
of a power trip with me.

26:55.197 --> 26:56.739
Everybody has a price.

26:56.824 --> 26:59.909
Tommy Lee Jones let me roll it in
my fingers for two hundred grand!

27:07.209 --> 27:09.794
Oh, my gosh, that was so crazy!

27:10.129 --> 27:12.296
I am so honored to be able to help you.

27:12.548 --> 27:14.549
Finally, somebody who knows who I am.

27:14.800 --> 27:16.050
Yeah, of course!

27:16.135 --> 27:19.804
You're the Wadiyan dissident who was
standing up to that asshole Aladeen.

27:20.305 --> 27:21.806
It was so brave of you.

27:22.057 --> 27:24.142
- My name is Zoey.
- I don't care.

27:24.351 --> 27:25.351
What's yours?

27:25.644 --> 27:28.312
My name is Ala... son.

27:28.814 --> 27:30.648
- Allison?
- Right. Allison.

27:30.983 --> 27:32.817
What's your last name?

27:35.737 --> 27:37.071
Burgers.

27:38.073 --> 27:39.907
Nice to meet you, Allison Burgers.

27:39.992 --> 27:41.701
- You know, I...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

27:42.369 --> 27:46.122
Allison, could you please
take your hands off my breasts?

27:46.498 --> 27:48.541
Those are breasts? I
thought you were a boy.

27:52.087 --> 27:54.755
- Where are you taking me to?
- To Brooklyn!

28:04.183 --> 28:06.309
So, yeah, this is my store!

28:06.393 --> 28:07.852
This is the Free Earth Collective.

28:08.103 --> 28:11.439
We are a vegan, feminist,
non-profit cooperative operating

28:11.523 --> 28:13.774
within an anti-racist,
anti-oppressive framework

28:13.859 --> 28:15.526
for people of all or no genders.

28:16.778 --> 28:18.946
We are a pure democracy,

28:19.031 --> 28:21.115
just like Wadiya's going to be soon!

28:21.450 --> 28:23.159
Get me clothes, little man.

28:23.452 --> 28:25.203
Oh, you know what, there's some
in the Earthquake Relief box

28:25.287 --> 28:26.829
in the lesbian bathroom, right there.

28:26.914 --> 28:28.122
Right.

28:29.208 --> 28:31.626
So, Allison, we're the
only store in New York,

28:31.710 --> 28:33.920
other than that fascist
superchain Green World,

28:34.004 --> 28:36.005
that sells your nation's
specialty fruit, mafroom,

28:36.465 --> 28:38.549
which I know you people eat a lot of.

28:38.884 --> 28:40.676
Oh, I hope that didn't come
off like a cultural stereotype.

28:40.761 --> 28:43.221
Because I'm, like, the
furthest thing from a racist.

28:43.513 --> 28:46.182
I pretty much haven't had a
white boyfriend since high school.

28:46.433 --> 28:48.226
Well, the darker races are less choosy.

28:49.853 --> 28:51.854
Okay, that came off
as kind of offensive.

28:52.105 --> 28:53.439
Thank you.

28:54.775 --> 28:56.692
Anyway, let me give you the grand tour.

28:56.777 --> 28:59.612
Up on the roof, we have this
amazing organic garden...

28:59.947 --> 29:02.448
Boring! Do you sell any assault rifles?

29:02.866 --> 29:05.534
Oh, wait. I got it. Humor. Right?

29:05.786 --> 29:08.287
I took a feminist clown workshop once.

29:08.538 --> 29:10.581
Help! Help! I'm trapped
under a glass ceiling!

29:10.958 --> 29:12.583
What the fuck?

29:12.918 --> 29:14.835
I wasn't the best student, but...

29:14.962 --> 29:17.380
We've got this wellness center
downstairs in the basement,

29:17.506 --> 29:20.758
where we do water birth. Have
you ever seen a water birth?

29:21.176 --> 29:23.386
Not a water birth, but
I've seen a water death.

29:23.637 --> 29:25.137
Wow. Was it moving?

29:25.597 --> 29:27.181
There was actually very little movement.

29:27.307 --> 29:30.309
A little wriggling, then two
bubbles, and then a big bloop

29:30.477 --> 29:31.686
and the wallet floats up.

29:33.271 --> 29:34.563
You seem educated.

29:34.815 --> 29:36.440
Yes. I went to Amherst.

29:36.858 --> 29:38.776
I love it when women go to school.

29:38.860 --> 29:41.862
It's like seeing a
monkey on rollerskates.

29:42.114 --> 29:45.116
It means nothing to them,
but it's so adorable for us.

29:45.701 --> 29:47.618
Okay. Well, hey, Allison,

29:47.703 --> 29:50.955
you know, we'd love to have you
work here if you ever wanted to.

29:51.039 --> 29:55.209
All of our employees are
political refugees, just like you!

29:55.419 --> 29:56.460
There's Hannah over here.

29:56.586 --> 30:00.464
She's from El Salvador. She's a
really useful member of our team.

30:03.051 --> 30:05.553
Useful as what? A coat hanger?

30:06.805 --> 30:08.639
- Come on.
- Allison, that's not funny.

30:08.974 --> 30:11.976
Okay. I tell you what, get
back to work, Captain Hook!

30:12.310 --> 30:14.478
- "Captain Hook." It's funny.
- No, it's not funny.

30:14.730 --> 30:15.730
Who's that?

30:15.981 --> 30:16.981
Oh, this is Joteph.

30:17.065 --> 30:19.483
He's from a Sudanese tribe
that has no concept of money.

30:19.735 --> 30:21.986
His entire village was ransacked.

30:22.237 --> 30:23.320
Hey, Sub-Saharan!

30:24.573 --> 30:28.159
Do you think you could get me 100
child soldiers here by 5:00 p.m.?

30:28.243 --> 30:29.285
No!

30:29.369 --> 30:30.661
Okay. Time out! Time out.

30:30.746 --> 30:31.954
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

30:32.247 --> 30:33.914
Shave your
under-the-arms!

30:34.249 --> 30:37.084
I dread to think what kind of
jungle you have on your malawach!

30:37.419 --> 30:38.919
That is very inappropriate.

30:39.087 --> 30:41.922
Don't tell me what to say and
what not to say, little boy.

30:42.090 --> 30:44.258
You need to put that finger away.

30:44.342 --> 30:45.718
I won't put my finger away because...

30:45.802 --> 30:47.303
Look, I've got two fingers now.

30:47.387 --> 30:48.429
Okay.

30:48.513 --> 30:52.099
If you do not stop using hateful
language, you cannot work here.

30:52.517 --> 30:54.477
All right. I promise.

30:54.561 --> 30:55.770
Okay.

30:57.189 --> 30:59.774
I tricked you, Wolverina.

31:01.109 --> 31:03.778
Justin Bieber's chubby double!

31:06.031 --> 31:07.865
Hairy Potter!

31:15.791 --> 31:17.458
Good-bye, old friend.

31:24.591 --> 31:25.966
When will the Supreme Leader be better?

31:26.051 --> 31:27.093
In time.

31:27.260 --> 31:31.597
He's resting in his bedroom and
must never, ever be disturbed.

31:32.015 --> 31:33.516
Time for bed.

31:37.687 --> 31:40.856
Being Aladeen has its
perks, does it not?

31:44.111 --> 31:45.694
Dropped your belt.

32:01.795 --> 32:03.170
What are you doing?

32:03.255 --> 32:04.463
She tried to milk me!

32:04.714 --> 32:05.714
No.

32:05.966 --> 32:08.134
They are trying to pleasure you.

32:08.301 --> 32:11.053
Allow the girls to
use their many talents.

32:20.689 --> 32:21.730
No!

32:21.815 --> 32:24.316
Supreme Leader! The girls!

32:24.651 --> 32:27.319
Girls, show him your bosoms.

32:53.221 --> 32:56.849
Let me in! I have 85
rooms at this hotel!

32:56.933 --> 32:59.018
It's me, Admiral General Aladeen!

32:59.102 --> 33:00.394
I lost my beard!

33:00.979 --> 33:02.104
You don't got a pass, you don't get in.

33:02.189 --> 33:05.524
But I'm staying here! I paid twenty
dollars for the fucking Internet!

33:06.318 --> 33:09.195
How much do you charge
for assassinations?

33:29.633 --> 33:31.634
Why is this happening to me?

33:32.552 --> 33:35.888
All I ever did was
steal my country's wealth

33:36.348 --> 33:39.391
and execute anybody who
did not agree with me,

33:40.018 --> 33:41.143
and many who did.

33:41.811 --> 33:42.895
Why me?

33:43.313 --> 33:47.024
Why is it always the good guys? Why?

33:54.032 --> 33:55.241
Nadal?

34:41.621 --> 34:43.621
Welcome to the Death
to Aladeen Restaurant.

34:44.331 --> 34:47.083
Wait. You look very familiar.

34:47.460 --> 34:48.752
Do I know you?

34:51.172 --> 34:53.632
Sorry.

34:54.009 --> 34:55.217
So sorry, Supreme Leader.

34:55.427 --> 34:57.219
Don't worry. I'm 50 % to blame.

34:59.889 --> 35:02.099
No! No! Supreme Leader!

35:02.976 --> 35:04.935
Definitely not. I must be going.

35:05.020 --> 35:06.145
No, no. Stay, please.

35:06.438 --> 35:08.564
If you hate Aladeen
and you like good food,

35:08.648 --> 35:11.650
this is the place for
you. This way. Here we go.

35:26.416 --> 35:27.666
Enjoy it.

35:31.338 --> 35:32.629
No! No!

35:48.188 --> 35:49.355
For you.

35:50.440 --> 35:51.815
What is your name?

35:52.233 --> 35:53.442
Allison Burgers.

35:54.235 --> 35:56.987
That's a made-up name.
What's your real name?

36:00.700 --> 36:01.742
Ladis.

36:02.035 --> 36:03.077
Ladis what?

36:03.495 --> 36:05.371
Ladis Washerum.

36:09.167 --> 36:11.585
So your name is like the
sign. "Ladies Washroom"?

36:11.669 --> 36:13.379
That is a made-up name.

36:13.755 --> 36:15.297
What is your real name?

36:15.507 --> 36:18.509
I am interested. We are interested.

36:22.555 --> 36:23.764
Emploice.

36:24.182 --> 36:25.432
Emploice what?

36:25.725 --> 36:28.185
Emploice... Muswashans.

36:30.772 --> 36:32.272
That is a made-up name.

36:34.567 --> 36:35.692
Okay.

36:35.777 --> 36:37.903
What is your real name?

36:38.571 --> 36:39.863
Max.

36:40.240 --> 36:41.240
Max what?

36:41.449 --> 36:45.202
Imumoccupancyu
One-hundred-and-twenty.

36:48.248 --> 36:50.499
There's a number in the name?

36:50.583 --> 36:53.210
Who are you? An Aladeen sympathizer?

36:53.420 --> 36:56.171
No, no, no! Whoa, whoa,
whoa. Okay. No, no, no!

36:56.256 --> 36:57.256
No!

36:57.340 --> 36:59.758
It's Aladeen! It's
Aladeen without the beard!

37:00.135 --> 37:01.885
No! It's not Aladeen!

37:02.762 --> 37:03.804
Hasan, lock the door!

37:06.891 --> 37:09.351
Wait, wait, wait, no!
There you are, cousin!

37:09.811 --> 37:12.146
This is my cousin. I
see you've all met him.

37:12.355 --> 37:15.149
He's very simple and
backwards. I'm sorry.

37:15.233 --> 37:16.358
- Sorry.
- It's okay, sit.

37:16.443 --> 37:17.776
- Okay.
- Sit and eat.

37:18.319 --> 37:19.611
Have a seat, cousin.

37:20.238 --> 37:22.614
Very sorry. My apologies. Enjoy.

37:22.824 --> 37:25.909
What are you doing here? And
what has happened to your beard?

37:26.369 --> 37:29.538
I've been replaced by this body
double who's a total imbecile.

37:29.664 --> 37:31.290
How are you alive?

37:31.458 --> 37:34.126
How am I... Wait. You don't know?

37:34.210 --> 37:35.335
No.

37:35.420 --> 37:38.797
Every single person you
had executed is still alive.

37:39.215 --> 37:41.216
We all live here in Little Wadiya.

37:41.301 --> 37:43.760
The executioner, he is a
member of the Resistance!

37:44.137 --> 37:45.345
You mean I never executed anybody?

37:45.430 --> 37:46.472
No.

37:46.556 --> 37:48.557
Like, honestly, zero people.

37:50.393 --> 37:54.396
Nadal, you must help
me get back into power.

37:54.480 --> 37:56.315
What? No. Why would I do that?

37:56.399 --> 37:58.775
I have a perfectly good
job here. I'm a Mac Genius!

37:59.611 --> 38:01.612
What do you do?

38:03.656 --> 38:06.950
Mostly, I clean semen out of laptops.

38:08.203 --> 38:10.204
Congratulations. Living
the American dream.

38:10.747 --> 38:13.415
Okay, fine. I will help
you. On one condition.

38:13.499 --> 38:14.750
Name it.

38:14.834 --> 38:16.460
You reinstate me as
Head of Nuclear Research,

38:17.337 --> 38:18.837
so I can finish building my bomb.

38:19.214 --> 38:20.214
Deal.

38:20.423 --> 38:22.674
One last thing.

38:22.967 --> 38:25.427
You will let me build
a round nuclear weapon.

38:25.845 --> 38:28.013
Never. It must be pointy.

38:28.556 --> 38:30.682
- Wait a minute. This is...
- Whoa.

38:31.893 --> 38:34.478
Okay, compromise. Conical.

38:34.562 --> 38:36.313
- Round. Round.
- Teat-shaped.

38:37.398 --> 38:38.649
Okay.

38:38.816 --> 38:40.275
- Okay. Deal.
- Deal.

38:43.613 --> 38:45.447
Ladies and gentlemen of the press,

38:45.531 --> 38:48.742
our Supreme Leader is indisposed
to answer your questions

38:49.035 --> 38:52.746
as he is currently drafting
Wadiya's new constitution,

38:53.039 --> 38:55.082
which is scheduled to be signed

38:55.166 --> 38:58.252
at the Lancaster Penthouse
Ballroom in three days.

38:58.336 --> 39:00.003
Thank you. No further questions.

39:13.935 --> 39:16.478
There is no way we're going
to get anywhere near this hotel

39:16.562 --> 39:18.939
without a security
pass. This is ridiculous.

39:19.691 --> 39:21.358
- Wait.
- What are you doing?

39:21.609 --> 39:23.610
Hiding from that lesbian hobbit.

39:24.112 --> 39:25.195
That woman, you know her?

39:25.571 --> 39:27.406
I cannot begin to tell
you what an honor it is

39:27.490 --> 39:29.366
to be able to provide
all of the catering...

39:29.450 --> 39:30.742
Well, of course.

39:30.827 --> 39:32.119
...and the mafroom for this signing.

39:32.203 --> 39:33.870
You just paid this month's rent!

39:34.080 --> 39:35.998
She offered me a job.

39:36.082 --> 39:38.834
Can you imagine that? Me? Working?

39:39.002 --> 39:42.379
Listen, hold onto that badge. It's the
only thing that'll get you past security.

39:42.463 --> 39:43.422
Okay, thanks.

39:43.506 --> 39:44.965
Wait a minute.

39:45.300 --> 39:49.177
Wait, her company is catering the
event. She has a security pass!

39:49.387 --> 39:51.555
That is the answer. This is the plan.

39:51.639 --> 39:54.141
Okay? You will take that job
and you will work for her.

39:54.475 --> 39:57.311
I will get you an
identical beard and costume.

39:57.520 --> 39:58.812
And then on the day of the event,

39:58.896 --> 40:01.982
you enter the Lancaster
as a member of her staff.

40:02.066 --> 40:04.067
You will find the
double, switch with him,

40:04.152 --> 40:06.611
then rip up the constitution
in front of the whole world.

40:07.071 --> 40:10.282
Me? Work for that hairy titted yeti?

40:27.342 --> 40:28.383
Kimberly?

40:29.218 --> 40:30.218
Zoey.

40:30.428 --> 40:31.511
Who cares?

40:31.971 --> 40:34.514
I've come here to apologize

40:34.891 --> 40:38.185
about some of the comments
I may have made about

40:38.353 --> 40:40.312
Captain Hook and Blackie.

40:42.273 --> 40:43.273
Great!

40:43.649 --> 40:45.901
And I accept your job
offer as general manager.

40:45.985 --> 40:48.028
Well, you can't be the manager,
because I am the manager.

40:48.363 --> 40:49.488
Well, I can if I killed you.

40:52.241 --> 40:54.242
I think I'm starting to get you.

40:54.327 --> 40:56.453
All right, then... I will get you.

40:57.372 --> 40:59.039
Great! Let's get you to work!

40:59.540 --> 41:01.124
Yeah? Hold on one second.

41:01.376 --> 41:04.002
Hey, my man! Excuse me. Hairnet!

41:04.128 --> 41:05.128
Yeah.

41:05.671 --> 41:08.131
I need a little of the
quinoa salad, please,

41:08.341 --> 41:11.134
and throw a couple of extra
cranny-b's on top, if you could,

41:11.344 --> 41:14.137
and I kind of need you to
hurry up, chief. Chop-chop.

41:17.266 --> 41:18.266
Next!

41:20.228 --> 41:22.145
Whoa, whoa! Occupied!

41:22.230 --> 41:24.523
Out. I have to clean. Come
on, out you go, out you go.

41:24.607 --> 41:25.899
- What? You're hurting me!
- Out. Come on.

41:26.275 --> 41:29.403
Hey, Allison, can you take
out the garbage? Thanks.

41:36.494 --> 41:39.955
Look! One of the customers left a tip of

41:40.248 --> 41:44.626
some Nair and some female razors.
Does anybody want to use it?

41:49.966 --> 41:51.091
Stop that.

41:52.093 --> 41:53.385
Suck it, loser.

42:00.309 --> 42:01.726
Clean-up on aisle four!

42:14.449 --> 42:16.032
Hey, buddy, I saw that.

42:16.117 --> 42:18.452
That is very disrespectful
to your leader.

42:18.661 --> 42:19.744
Whatever, dude. Who are you,

42:19.829 --> 42:22.289
Osama bin Laden's best friend?

42:22.457 --> 42:25.000
No, he is not my best friend!

42:25.209 --> 42:26.877
Though he has been
staying in my guest house

42:26.961 --> 42:29.045
ever since they shot
his double last year.

42:30.214 --> 42:31.965
Now the guy won't leave.

42:32.049 --> 42:34.259
I know why this guy's the
most hated man in the world.

42:34.343 --> 42:36.344
You just have to go to
the bathroom after him.

42:36.471 --> 42:38.388
You go to the bathroom after Osama,

42:38.473 --> 42:41.224
you will realize the
true meaning of terrorism.

43:00.536 --> 43:01.703
Here is the plan.

43:01.787 --> 43:03.538
We're going to take this helicopter tour

43:03.623 --> 43:06.082
and fly over the Lancaster
to spot its weaknesses.

43:06.417 --> 43:10.003
Remember, we're just two
ordinary American tourists

43:10.338 --> 43:12.339
looking at the sights.

43:12.548 --> 43:15.842
Don't worry, nobody gonna suspect
anything. It's a great plan, pointy.

43:16.302 --> 43:17.802
Don't do anything to
arouse any suspicions.

43:17.887 --> 43:20.722
Don't worry. I am
Wadiya's number one actor.

43:20.806 --> 43:23.475
You don't win four Wadiyan
Golden Globes for nothing.

43:23.559 --> 43:25.894
Yes, you do, because you
gave them to yourself!

43:26.354 --> 43:29.064
My performance in Aladeen
Jones and the Temple of Doom

43:29.148 --> 43:30.190
was outstanding.

43:30.274 --> 43:31.650
I give it thumbs down.

43:31.734 --> 43:33.443
Have you seen You've Got Mail Bomb?

43:33.945 --> 43:36.404
Yes, I've seen them all!
They're all terrible movies!

43:36.489 --> 43:37.864
Listen to me. Okay?

43:38.241 --> 43:40.033
You are a terrible actor.

43:40.117 --> 43:44.246
I urge you, right now, keep
your performance small and real.

43:44.330 --> 43:46.248
All right, can you get me a cloak?

43:46.332 --> 43:47.332
Why?

43:47.416 --> 43:49.167
Because I think my guy
would be wearing a cloak.

43:49.252 --> 43:53.463
No, your guy wears an American flag
sweatsuit and a sheriff's badge.

43:53.548 --> 43:54.548
I need the sheriff's badge.

43:54.632 --> 43:56.049
For what?

43:56.133 --> 43:57.425
You're sheriff of American douche-town!

43:58.177 --> 43:59.177
That's rude.

43:59.262 --> 44:00.262
Listen.

44:00.346 --> 44:04.224
We're going to walk over
there, act very inconspicuous.

44:04.684 --> 44:05.725
- Okay. No problem.
- This has to work.

44:05.851 --> 44:07.519
Don't worry. Just relax.

44:10.189 --> 44:11.273
Are you okay?

44:11.691 --> 44:12.691
My guy has a limp.

44:13.192 --> 44:16.278
I fell off me horse at
the old Bull & Bush Pub

44:16.362 --> 44:17.529
because I am a cockney.

44:17.697 --> 44:18.863
Listen! Listen, okay?

44:19.031 --> 44:21.741
You need to focus up
right now and be prepared

44:21.909 --> 44:24.119
to deliver a small, subtle performance.

44:24.203 --> 44:25.620
- Okay, great, okay.
- Okay, good.

44:25.705 --> 44:27.247
Okay. So, when we go to fly...

44:27.331 --> 44:28.999
Don't do that with your eyes!

44:29.083 --> 44:30.750
You can't be a Chinese
person on this thing, okay?

44:30.835 --> 44:32.127
I'm not chink, I'm Chinese-American!

44:32.211 --> 44:33.295
No, but you cannot hold your eyes!

44:33.379 --> 44:34.588
Nobody is going to think
you're Chinese-American

44:34.672 --> 44:35.630
because you hold your eyes like that!

44:35.715 --> 44:37.173
It's racist, what you are doing!

44:37.258 --> 44:39.801
Do you know it's a fact that
they cannot pronounce their R's?

44:39.885 --> 44:41.052
They pronounce them as L's.

44:41.137 --> 44:43.013
So instead you know what
"rabbit" is in Chinese?

44:43.097 --> 44:44.222
I don't know how to speak Chinese.

44:44.307 --> 44:46.516
- It's "labbit."
- It's not "labbit"!

44:46.601 --> 44:49.227
Yes! Who Shot Loger Labbit
was a huge hit in China!

44:49.312 --> 44:50.312
Nobody... It's stup...

44:50.396 --> 44:51.438
All right, I don't care.
This is stupid, okay?

44:51.814 --> 44:54.482
Okay, I'll do Filipino. I
like to work, I like to talk.

44:54.567 --> 44:55.817
- Don't.
- I like the shit, I do the kids.

44:55.901 --> 44:56.901
Stop that.

44:57.737 --> 45:00.488
Your Filipino is the
same as your Chinese!

45:01.032 --> 45:02.365
Now who's being a lacist?

45:03.075 --> 45:04.909
- You're being lacist now.
- I'm not being racist!

45:04.994 --> 45:06.661
Right now we have to
get on this helicopter

45:06.829 --> 45:08.913
and we have to act like true Americans.

45:09.081 --> 45:10.790
I guess you don't want
me to play black then.

45:11.292 --> 45:13.251
Of course I don't
want you to play black.

45:13.377 --> 45:15.086
Okay. Just throwing it out there.

45:15.212 --> 45:16.755
Okay. Don't.

45:18.007 --> 45:19.090
Okay, don't do that.

45:19.216 --> 45:21.092
- I see what you're doing.
- That's how they walk.

45:21.177 --> 45:22.135
I see what you're doing, it's not cool.

45:22.261 --> 45:23.261
It's how they walk.

45:36.942 --> 45:39.069
I love being an Americans!

45:39.570 --> 45:41.654
America is number one!

45:42.448 --> 45:44.449
Oh, I am from U.S.A.!

45:44.533 --> 45:46.910
My father also from U.S.A.

45:47.536 --> 45:51.373
My great-grandfather fought
in the American Civil Jihad.

45:52.458 --> 45:54.709
I am very proud to be an American.

45:54.794 --> 45:57.420
I am America's number one douche.

46:00.841 --> 46:02.759
I've fooled them. Job done.

46:03.552 --> 46:06.388
So, how are things back at the Palace?

46:06.889 --> 46:10.600
Fine, but guess who's still
living in my guest house?

46:11.644 --> 46:12.644
Ooh, Bin Laden?

46:14.063 --> 46:15.355
Yes, Osama.

46:15.439 --> 46:18.066
Bin Laden flooding the bathroom
every time he showers...

46:18.150 --> 46:22.028
And how hard is it to put
a bath mat down, Bin Laden?

46:24.031 --> 46:27.033
Hey, do you remember
my favorite sports car?

46:27.118 --> 46:28.660
You mean your Porsche?

46:28.744 --> 46:30.245
Yes... the 911.

46:30.329 --> 46:32.747
911, it's the best!

46:33.374 --> 46:37.335
So I was driving my 911
near the palace one day...

46:37.420 --> 46:39.629
and I totally crashed!

46:43.759 --> 46:46.010
It's ok, I've already ordered a new one.

46:46.095 --> 46:49.013
A brand new 9112012.

46:51.475 --> 46:54.352
You know, while you are here, you
should try to see some of the sights...

46:54.437 --> 46:57.564
such as the Empire State Building...

46:57.648 --> 47:00.525
and Yankee Stadium.

47:00.609 --> 47:05.196
And I'd love to see the fireworks
over the Statue of Liberty.

47:10.161 --> 47:12.370
Hey, have your old back
problems been bothering you?

47:12.455 --> 47:16.166
Oh, it's been terrible! It got so
bad that I made myself a back brace.

47:16.250 --> 47:20.795
- Really?
- Yes, look, I'm still wearing it.

47:22.465 --> 47:24.841
Hey, my English is getting good...

47:24.925 --> 47:28.553
...I bet I can count down
from five faster than you can!

47:28.888 --> 47:30.805
Five, four, three, two, one!

47:36.687 --> 47:38.521
Allison! Are you okay?

47:38.606 --> 47:40.064
I... Yes.

47:40.149 --> 47:42.775
You know what? You
people, you make me sick!

47:42.860 --> 47:45.320
You see a Middle
Easterner on an aircraft

47:45.404 --> 47:48.448
and you just assume that he's
hatching some violent plot?

47:48.532 --> 47:53.077
Allison Burgers is a persecuted
dissident, not a murderous madman!

47:53.162 --> 47:55.997
He was reported saying, "Let's take
out the guards at the Lancaster."

47:56.081 --> 47:58.541
Guess what? We deliver to the Lancaster!

47:58.626 --> 47:59.626
Good one!

47:59.710 --> 48:02.795
Maybe he wanted to take the
guards out for a falafel!

48:02.880 --> 48:04.130
That's a bit of a stereotype,

48:04.215 --> 48:07.342
but I get the idea.
Great idea! Yeah. You...

48:07.426 --> 48:10.428
You know what? Is it a
crime to care about your job?

48:10.513 --> 48:11.679
Yeah! Well, it is in Wadiya.

48:12.306 --> 48:15.266
Where did you get your diversity
and sensitivity training, huh?

48:15.351 --> 48:16.559
The Stasi?

48:16.644 --> 48:20.647
Let's see how you feel about racial
profiling when white people...

48:33.244 --> 48:34.786
And I know what I'm talking about

48:34.870 --> 48:37.413
because I majored in Fem Lit!

48:38.249 --> 48:39.457
Come on.

48:40.960 --> 48:42.794
Hey! What are you doing?
Where are you going?

48:42.878 --> 48:43.878
Don't worry!

48:43.963 --> 48:46.047
Just suck the fatoot of the
biggest guy, you'll be fine.

48:46.131 --> 48:47.131
You're really fucking me here, man!

48:49.760 --> 48:51.469
The police here are such fascists!

48:51.554 --> 48:52.679
Yeah, right, and not in a good way.

48:52.763 --> 48:54.389
It just makes me so mad!

48:54.473 --> 48:57.225
You know, Zoey, you
were great back there.

48:57.309 --> 48:58.935
Thanks. I just...

48:59.562 --> 49:01.104
I don't know, I just feel so sorry

49:01.188 --> 49:02.564
that wherever you go in the world,

49:02.648 --> 49:04.315
you're the victim of police abuse.

49:04.400 --> 49:05.483
Well, not always the victim.

49:05.651 --> 49:09.946
Come here. I'm just so
sorry! You're okay now.

49:10.197 --> 49:11.281
All right?

49:11.365 --> 49:13.741
And I'm not gonna let
anything bad happen to you.

49:13.826 --> 49:15.535
You know what? Let's get you
back to the collective, okay?

49:16.328 --> 49:17.287
Come on.

49:17.371 --> 49:18.371
No, a bit more.

49:18.998 --> 49:20.290
Okay.

49:20.958 --> 49:22.959
- Come on, let's go. I need to go to work.
- I feel so sad!

49:24.628 --> 49:25.712
Let's do another hug, okay?

49:25.838 --> 49:27.505
Allison, why are you sad?

49:28.674 --> 49:30.008
The brutality?

49:30.301 --> 49:32.093
Did you suffer from sexual abuse?

49:32.177 --> 49:35.305
Yes, they raped me in a
very unprofessional way.

49:36.682 --> 49:38.641
Oh, no. We have to get
you to the Rape Center.

49:38.726 --> 49:40.560
You have a center for rape here?

49:40.644 --> 49:42.895
Great! I'd love to go!
Maybe another time, you know.

49:42.980 --> 49:46.274
Hire a limo, have some
cocktails, bring my raping shoes.

49:54.950 --> 49:56.326
Can you get me that one?

49:57.536 --> 49:58.536
Which one?

49:59.121 --> 50:00.788
The one with the "fuck-me hooves."

50:01.582 --> 50:03.833
You're bizzare. I'm going to
have to change the channels now.

50:04.293 --> 50:07.086
...tour from hell for an Ohio
couple earlier today when,

50:07.254 --> 50:08.463
...with shades of 9l11,

50:08.547 --> 50:11.591
their helicopter tour of the
Manhattan skyline was cut short

50:11.675 --> 50:15.803
by what police are now calling
a "terrorism misunderstanding"

50:15.888 --> 50:19.724
involving a man named
Emer Gencyexitonly.

50:20.517 --> 50:21.517
Etra.

50:23.228 --> 50:24.395
We have a problem.

50:29.401 --> 50:31.819
Hannah, that guy from the
Lancaster's coming tomorrow morning,

50:31.904 --> 50:33.696
so why don't you take
the mafroom downstairs

50:33.781 --> 50:35.782
and make some sort of a nice display?

50:35.908 --> 50:38.451
I just want everything to be perfect.

50:39.078 --> 50:40.161
Zoey?

50:40.245 --> 50:41.412
Allison. Hi.

50:41.580 --> 50:44.165
To thank you for what you did
today at the police station,

50:44.249 --> 50:46.501
I have decided to
bestow upon you a gift.

50:46.877 --> 50:49.212
- That's sweet. What is it?
- Yeah.

50:56.595 --> 50:59.263
I don't know what that is.

50:59.431 --> 51:02.141
It's fine. Please,
gobble up my little mouse.

51:02.935 --> 51:04.185
Snack on my tiny raisin.

51:04.436 --> 51:05.895
Give her a mouth bath. Go.

51:07.940 --> 51:09.899
Oh! No!

51:10.943 --> 51:13.444
No, I am not going to do that.

51:13.779 --> 51:15.988
I'm getting a lot of this
and not much of this...

51:19.618 --> 51:21.828
Listen, I understand that
you're having urges, okay?

51:21.912 --> 51:22.954
Right.

51:23.038 --> 51:25.623
But you need to take
care of them by yourself.

51:25.916 --> 51:27.750
Myself? What? How?

51:27.960 --> 51:29.544
You need to touch yourself.

51:29.711 --> 51:32.380
I don't touch myself.
Do you touch yourself?

51:32.756 --> 51:35.007
I think most healthy people do, yes.

51:35.092 --> 51:38.428
Yeah, you touch your own
malawach? Disgusting! Yuck!

51:38.512 --> 51:39.595
Yuck!

51:39.847 --> 51:43.266
Stop joking, all right?
You've never jerked off?

51:45.269 --> 51:46.853
Okay, come with me.

51:46.937 --> 51:48.938
Where are you taking
me to? The Rape Center?

51:52.985 --> 51:54.485
This is silly.

51:54.820 --> 51:56.154
Okay...

51:56.655 --> 51:59.574
Take your penis out and
put it in your hands.

51:59.658 --> 52:00.700
This is silly.

52:02.661 --> 52:06.622
Now, slowly move your hand up and down.

52:06.707 --> 52:07.790
Okay.

52:08.625 --> 52:10.793
I told you already, this is...

52:14.131 --> 52:15.298
Wait.

52:15.757 --> 52:17.550
What sorcery is this?

52:17.634 --> 52:20.678
Some people wait a lifetime

52:20.762 --> 52:25.475
For a moment like this

52:25.559 --> 52:28.811
Some people wait a lifetime

52:28.896 --> 52:31.814
For a moment like this

52:31.899 --> 52:37.236
Whoa, I can't believe
it's happening to me

52:37.321 --> 52:40.239
Some people wait a lifetime

52:40.324 --> 52:45.828
For a moment like this

52:50.459 --> 52:54.795
I can't believe it's happening to me

52:56.256 --> 52:59.050
I did it! I just jerked
it completely off!

52:59.134 --> 53:00.593
I did it all by myself!

53:00.677 --> 53:03.012
With this hand right here!

53:03.096 --> 53:06.307
I grabbed my bilbul like
I was strangling a bird.

53:06.391 --> 53:08.559
And I smacked it and I smacked
it and I gave it a flick,

53:08.644 --> 53:09.977
and out came my own labeneh!

53:10.229 --> 53:11.229
Zoey?

53:11.396 --> 53:14.982
Zoey! You have changed my life!

53:15.526 --> 53:19.570
Give a man a vagina and
he will shpichs for a day.

53:19.905 --> 53:23.366
Teach a man to use his hand as a vagina,

53:23.575 --> 53:25.409
and he will shpichs for a lifetime.

53:25.869 --> 53:27.995
Oh. No, no. Thank you.

53:29.039 --> 53:31.415
Allison, you may need to keep
your voice down because...

53:31.959 --> 53:34.460
We've got a lot of customers.
You may want to go wash up.

53:34.545 --> 53:35.586
Fine.

53:35.671 --> 53:38.339
Joteph, go and hose down my Crocs.

53:38.757 --> 53:41.842
I've done my labeneh all
over the wellness center.

53:46.223 --> 53:47.515
Okay.

53:50.269 --> 53:52.895
The guy from the Lancaster
is going to love this.

53:53.730 --> 53:54.730
Okay.

53:55.065 --> 53:56.274
Good night, Allison.

53:56.567 --> 53:58.150
I'll see you tomorrow morning.

53:58.360 --> 54:00.903
Good night! Thank you again.

54:05.242 --> 54:07.618
This is nice. Or lovely.

54:12.833 --> 54:14.292
- Who is it?
- Nadal.

54:14.376 --> 54:15.418
What are you doing?

54:15.502 --> 54:17.128
I've discovered this amazing thing.

54:17.254 --> 54:19.046
I have to show you how to do it.

54:19.798 --> 54:20.965
It's called self juicing.

54:21.049 --> 54:24.051
You put your hand on your
bilbul and you rub it,

54:24.136 --> 54:26.387
and then you can make
your own labeneh come out.

54:26.471 --> 54:27.847
You don't have to spend any Rolexes.

54:27.973 --> 54:29.765
You don't have to give
any dirty diamonds.

54:29.850 --> 54:32.685
I cannot believe I'm having this
conversation with an adult man.

54:32.769 --> 54:34.353
What do you mean? You knew about this?

54:34.479 --> 54:35.813
Everybody knows about this.

54:36.481 --> 54:39.817
We all know about this
from the age of 12, 13.

54:39.985 --> 54:41.986
Why does nobody ever tell me anything?

54:42.154 --> 54:44.947
Because you have everybody
executed who tells you anything.

54:45.240 --> 54:47.658
Listen, I'm thinking of
revealing my true identity

54:47.868 --> 54:49.660
to the hairy titted ape woman.

54:49.745 --> 54:51.954
Whoa! No, what? Why
would you even do that?

54:52.039 --> 54:53.581
I think she'll be cool with it.

54:53.832 --> 54:55.291
She will not be cool with it.

54:55.417 --> 54:58.461
How is she to judge? She
shaves her armpits once a year,

54:58.545 --> 55:01.172
and she takes lovers
outside of her ethnic group.

55:01.381 --> 55:03.257
Are my crimes any worse than hers?

55:03.508 --> 55:05.509
Remember, you hate her.

55:05.761 --> 55:07.219
And everything she stands for.

55:07.638 --> 55:09.597
- Okay.
- I have to go now.

55:10.932 --> 55:11.932
I despise you.

55:12.142 --> 55:14.185
You know, sometimes you say
some very hurtful things.

55:14.353 --> 55:15.853
Anyway, I'm going to hang up on you.

55:15.979 --> 55:18.856
No, come on. This is like
a real opportunity for me.

55:18.940 --> 55:20.024
I want to hang up first.

55:20.108 --> 55:21.817
I've hung up. I hung up already.

55:23.528 --> 55:25.780
That is your voice doing that
noise. You have not hung up.

55:25.864 --> 55:27.531
I am hanging up. Click...

55:28.742 --> 55:29.950
Nadal, are you still there?

55:31.453 --> 55:33.704
- Nadal, are you still there?
- I win.

55:34.581 --> 55:36.165
No wonder you're a Mac Genius.

55:37.042 --> 55:38.501
What a fucking idiot.

55:45.258 --> 55:53.307
Zoey!

55:56.728 --> 55:57.895
Zoey.

56:09.241 --> 56:10.241
Zoey?

56:12.953 --> 56:13.953
Etra.

56:15.747 --> 56:16.747
Etra...

56:43.316 --> 56:45.776
Etra, is this because
you're the only virgin guard

56:45.861 --> 56:47.027
that I left a virgin?

58:16.243 --> 58:18.828
One, two...

58:20.914 --> 58:21.997
Bloop.

58:23.583 --> 58:24.750
Text book.

58:26.461 --> 58:29.296
Thank you so much for
meeting me early, Mr. Ogden.

58:29.631 --> 58:31.382
I cannot wait for you
to sample our mafroom.

58:31.550 --> 58:33.342
You are gonna swear
that you're in Wadiya.

58:34.344 --> 58:36.262
Excuse me. What is that over there?

58:36.555 --> 58:38.514
That is a "C" in your window.

58:38.723 --> 58:40.850
No, no, no... They're totally
biased against this. They hate us.

58:40.934 --> 58:42.685
No, it's not. I know what a "C" means.

58:42.769 --> 58:43.978
It's not a very good...

58:48.400 --> 58:49.567
Oh, my God!

58:50.735 --> 58:52.194
Allison, what happened?

58:54.906 --> 58:56.490
I don't know, I...

58:56.783 --> 58:59.243
I was downstairs self juicing.

59:01.037 --> 59:02.037
All night?

59:02.330 --> 59:03.330
Yes.

59:03.498 --> 59:04.790
I'm sorry, you were doing what?

59:05.250 --> 59:06.417
Doing the jerk off.

59:06.793 --> 59:08.544
Jerking myself to totally off.

59:08.628 --> 59:10.170
- I'm sorry?
- Let me show you.

59:10.380 --> 59:11.589
- No.
- She taught me.

59:11.756 --> 59:12.840
Oh, she taught you, did she?

59:12.924 --> 59:15.342
- No...
- Well, thank you very much.

59:15.510 --> 59:16.677
The contract is canceled.

59:16.761 --> 59:17.761
- That's it!
- No.

59:17.846 --> 59:19.263
No, I'm going to Green World. It's over.

59:19.431 --> 59:20.848
- No, Mr. Ogden.
- Remember, I have to pay that...

59:20.932 --> 59:23.893
- Please, no, no.
- Self juicing. Filth!

59:24.936 --> 59:26.020
Oh, my God...

59:26.438 --> 59:27.521
Zoey...

59:27.772 --> 59:29.315
We must get that contract back.

59:29.608 --> 59:30.774
We can't!

59:30.984 --> 59:33.903
It's impossible. We can't
compete with Green World.

59:34.613 --> 59:36.447
We will see about that.

59:36.531 --> 59:39.658
But from now on, it is my way

59:39.743 --> 59:44.413
or the highwahahtmaa
- fferrohshelechnichway.

59:45.040 --> 59:47.458
There has been a regime change!

59:47.542 --> 59:49.877
Yo! You are stocking the shelves.

59:50.295 --> 59:52.713
You, senile Romanian accountant.

59:52.797 --> 59:54.465
You are on the cash register.

59:54.633 --> 59:58.552
The CEO of Green World
does not drive a hybrid!

01:00:00.805 --> 01:00:02.973
The chemicals in Green World produce

01:00:03.224 --> 01:00:05.392
made this boy grow tits!

01:00:11.066 --> 01:00:13.233
You promise not to steal again?

01:00:13.318 --> 01:00:14.985
I won't. I won't!

01:00:15.236 --> 01:00:16.946
Give him one more for fun, Viktor.

01:00:36.967 --> 01:00:38.384
Good choice.

01:00:53.108 --> 01:00:54.775
Hi, Viktor.

01:01:10.792 --> 01:01:12.376
Supreme Grocer.

01:01:12.460 --> 01:01:14.211
The radicchio has
been washed and sorted,

01:01:14.295 --> 01:01:16.046
and the spray hose has
been tightly coiled.

01:01:16.131 --> 01:01:17.798
Very good. Now go upstairs

01:01:17.882 --> 01:01:20.134
and finish composting the
wheatgrass tailings, okay?

01:01:20.218 --> 01:01:21.468
Yes, Supreme Grocer.

01:01:23.471 --> 01:01:24.805
Zoey!

01:01:24.889 --> 01:01:27.141
What? Look...

01:01:27.767 --> 01:01:28.809
Wow!

01:01:29.436 --> 01:01:30.894
It's amazing!

01:01:30.979 --> 01:01:33.731
Oh, it's not amazing. It's
just a little less shit.

01:01:34.024 --> 01:01:35.816
Well, thank you.

01:01:37.027 --> 01:01:38.777
- Sorry.
- Oh, of course.

01:01:38.862 --> 01:01:41.739
- Personal.
- Thank you. Thank you again.

01:01:43.908 --> 01:01:45.826
- Hello?
- I have some very good news.

01:01:45.910 --> 01:01:46.952
What is it?

01:01:47.037 --> 01:01:50.664
I managed to buy some beards at the
wig store today that are perfect.

01:01:50.749 --> 01:01:52.958
No, Nadal, it must be real hair.

01:01:53.043 --> 01:01:55.085
- And from the head of a great man!
- What?

01:01:55.170 --> 01:01:56.837
Like Castro or Gandalf.

01:01:56.921 --> 01:01:58.172
No...

01:02:01.009 --> 01:02:03.677
Well done, Nadal. This beard is perfect.

01:02:08.850 --> 01:02:10.934
Those are lovely flowers.

01:02:11.019 --> 01:02:12.936
You know, Zoey is thinking of opening

01:02:13.021 --> 01:02:15.355
an eco-friendly flower
section to the store.

01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:18.734
This is the fifth time you've
mentioned her today. What is going on?

01:02:18.818 --> 01:02:20.486
The signing is in two days.

01:02:20.570 --> 01:02:22.404
Tell me you're not
falling for this woman!

01:02:22.864 --> 01:02:25.532
Of course I'm not. This is silly.

01:02:25.867 --> 01:02:28.869
Okay, good. All we need to
do is slip into this chapel...

01:02:28.953 --> 01:02:30.120
And yet, it's strange.

01:02:30.205 --> 01:02:32.122
The other day, I asked her to, you know,

01:02:32.207 --> 01:02:34.875
gobble on my bilbul and she said, "No."

01:02:34.959 --> 01:02:36.960
So obviously I wanted to execute her.

01:02:37.045 --> 01:02:40.297
But the thought of her
decapitated head actually upset me,

01:02:40.381 --> 01:02:42.132
- so I decided not to do it.
- No.

01:02:42.217 --> 01:02:45.552
When the thought of someone's
decapitated head upsets you,

01:02:45.637 --> 01:02:47.387
that is love.

01:02:47.639 --> 01:02:50.641
- I swear, I don't even like her at all.
- You don't like her?

01:02:50.809 --> 01:02:53.560
She has the body shape
of a 14-year-old boy.

01:02:53.895 --> 01:02:57.648
Well, that is a particular
weakness of yours.

01:02:57.732 --> 01:02:59.650
Need I remind you of
the Menudo incident?

01:02:59.859 --> 01:03:01.610
Those boys had their eyes open.

01:03:01.694 --> 01:03:02.986
They knew exactly what they were doing.

01:03:03.071 --> 01:03:04.571
We made them have their eyes open.

01:03:04.656 --> 01:03:06.824
You made me hold one of their eyes open,

01:03:06.908 --> 01:03:08.534
so they'd see what
you were doing to them.

01:03:09.119 --> 01:03:11.161
They seemed to be having
a pretty good time.

01:03:11.246 --> 01:03:13.705
They were not. Those boys were crying.

01:03:13.998 --> 01:03:15.249
Three of them killed themselves!

01:03:16.251 --> 01:03:17.376
Nothing to do with me.

01:03:17.460 --> 01:03:19.837
Everything to do with you!
A lot of them wrote notes.

01:03:19.921 --> 01:03:22.589
In their suicide notes
they named you by name!

01:03:22.841 --> 01:03:25.133
It's all a rumor. And
you're being silly.

01:03:25.718 --> 01:03:27.052
Hello, gentlemen. How you doin'?

01:03:27.345 --> 01:03:28.846
Are you guys friends of the deceased?

01:03:29.556 --> 01:03:30.931
How do I put this?

01:03:31.182 --> 01:03:32.683
He was my nigger.

01:03:33.017 --> 01:03:34.476
No, that's not the way to put it.

01:03:34.602 --> 01:03:36.228
- Whoa, whoa!
- No?

01:03:36.479 --> 01:03:37.771
He was my negger. Nigger. Nagger?

01:03:37.981 --> 01:03:39.189
- No, no, no.
- What is that?

01:03:39.274 --> 01:03:40.566
- Negar. Nigger? Nagur?
- No, no.

01:03:40.650 --> 01:03:41.817
Please stop. Please.

01:03:41.901 --> 01:03:42.943
I told you, before we came in.

01:03:43.027 --> 01:03:45.529
One word, do not say. Is the
exact word you're using now.

01:03:45.613 --> 01:03:46.989
- No, I said Nuga...
- One dozen times.

01:03:47.198 --> 01:03:50.117
Please relate to him that there
could be two funerals today.

01:03:50.243 --> 01:03:52.202
I... Believe me when I tell you,

01:03:52.328 --> 01:03:55.622
we are here only to pay
our respects to a great man.

01:03:55.874 --> 01:03:58.041
Okay, Eldridge's casket is
laying in the chapel right now.

01:03:58.334 --> 01:03:59.877
We're gonna have the
viewing in a few minutes.

01:04:00.211 --> 01:04:01.378
Thank you very much.

01:04:03.006 --> 01:04:04.381
I love your music, by the way.

01:04:04.549 --> 01:04:05.924
No, it's not. He's not a musician.

01:04:06.050 --> 01:04:09.928
I'm so, so sorry that Whitney
turned out like she did.

01:04:10.054 --> 01:04:11.305
- It's not Bobby Brown.
- Hey...

01:04:15.977 --> 01:04:18.228
- Go there.
- Okay. Here we go.

01:04:27.864 --> 01:04:28.947
Hello? Somebody in here?

01:04:29.032 --> 01:04:31.158
Nadal! The Sub-Saharans
have discovered us!

01:04:31.242 --> 01:04:32.826
- What? Okay, okay, okay!
- Hurry, hurry!

01:04:32.911 --> 01:04:34.411
- Just a moment!
- What you doin' in there?

01:04:34.913 --> 01:04:36.538
Jerking off.

01:04:37.123 --> 01:04:38.123
Open this door!

01:04:38.583 --> 01:04:40.500
- No, no, no!
- Open the door now!

01:04:40.752 --> 01:04:43.086
Quick! Plan B! Plan B!

01:04:52.680 --> 01:04:53.764
Why did you chop off his head?

01:04:53.848 --> 01:04:54.932
You said Plan B!

01:04:55.016 --> 01:04:56.808
Plan B was to have coffee and regroup,

01:04:56.893 --> 01:04:59.227
it was not to chop his head off!

01:05:07.278 --> 01:05:09.071
Good morning, Nadal!

01:05:09.948 --> 01:05:12.282
Wake up! Good morning, Nadal!

01:05:14.827 --> 01:05:16.411
No, no, no, no, no, no!

01:05:16.579 --> 01:05:17.621
Get this away from me!

01:05:17.705 --> 01:05:18.956
You know, me and you are quite a team.

01:05:19.040 --> 01:05:20.040
No, no.

01:05:20.124 --> 01:05:21.541
You know who else makes a great team?

01:05:21.626 --> 01:05:24.086
Ebony and ivory

01:05:24.170 --> 01:05:25.587
No, no, no!

01:05:25.713 --> 01:05:27.047
Live together in perfect harmony

01:05:27.131 --> 01:05:28.131
What is wrong with
you? Get it out of here!

01:05:29.175 --> 01:05:30.175
Good one.

01:05:34.639 --> 01:05:36.598
Splish splash I was taking a bath!

01:05:37.558 --> 01:05:39.142
No! Get it out of here!

01:05:40.311 --> 01:05:41.979
Oh, that is weird.

01:05:43.481 --> 01:05:48.318
I threw in some carob-covered goji
berries, just as a treat. Enjoy.

01:05:48.820 --> 01:05:53.073
Thank you. That's very kind
of you. You're a very nice man.

01:05:53.658 --> 01:05:55.659
What the fuck did you call me?

01:05:56.661 --> 01:05:58.495
I said you were nice!

01:06:03.501 --> 01:06:07.421
Allison! The Lancaster just
called! We got the contract back!

01:06:07.505 --> 01:06:09.589
- Great! Whatever!
- I know!

01:06:09.674 --> 01:06:12.009
Green World is shutting
down their Manhattan store!

01:06:12.343 --> 01:06:14.219
I wonder what could have happened?

01:06:16.180 --> 01:06:18.265
Be careful with that,
sweetheart. Be careful.

01:06:18.599 --> 01:06:21.351
Oh, yeah, we're going
to have a nice big salad.

01:06:22.186 --> 01:06:23.895
Celebratory cuddle?

01:06:25.523 --> 01:06:26.606
Well done!

01:06:26.774 --> 01:06:28.191
- You smell bad.
- I know.

01:06:28.693 --> 01:06:29.776
Help!

01:06:29.861 --> 01:06:32.070
Somebody help! My wife is in labor!

01:06:32.405 --> 01:06:34.031
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

01:06:34.198 --> 01:06:36.992
Baby? The ambulance can't be here
for 20 minutes. Can you hold it?

01:06:37.076 --> 01:06:38.744
I can't hold it! It's coming out!

01:06:39.037 --> 01:06:40.162
It's coming out!

01:06:40.246 --> 01:06:42.956
Does anyone have any medical experience?

01:06:43.207 --> 01:06:46.793
I was Wadiya's Chief Surgeon
for the last 22 years.

01:06:47.086 --> 01:06:48.879
Please. Please help us. Please.

01:06:49.130 --> 01:06:51.131
- Allison, they need your help. Come on.
- Okay, fine.

01:06:51.758 --> 01:06:52.758
Come on.

01:06:53.259 --> 01:06:54.342
Are you okay?

01:06:55.762 --> 01:06:57.471
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What are you doing?

01:06:57.555 --> 01:06:58.930
Sorry! Old habits die hard.

01:06:59.390 --> 01:07:01.058
All right, I'm going in.

01:07:02.977 --> 01:07:04.019
That's the wrong hole!

01:07:04.103 --> 01:07:06.063
- What?
- You just put your fist up the wrong hole.

01:07:06.230 --> 01:07:07.856
If I had a dollar for
every time I heard that.

01:07:09.734 --> 01:07:10.776
Get it outta there.

01:07:11.486 --> 01:07:13.487
- Going in again.
- Okay, good.

01:07:13.654 --> 01:07:15.238
Still my asshole!

01:07:15.490 --> 01:07:16.990
What is wrong with you, man?

01:07:17.075 --> 01:07:18.533
You just put it in my asshole again!

01:07:18.618 --> 01:07:20.118
Just go up from where you are.

01:07:20.828 --> 01:07:23.455
The good news is, your
prostate is completely healthy.

01:07:24.415 --> 01:07:26.083
That's good. That's good.

01:07:26.334 --> 01:07:27.709
- Going in again.
- Okay, good.

01:07:31.422 --> 01:07:32.589
Hold on.

01:07:33.925 --> 01:07:34.966
What are you...

01:07:37.011 --> 01:07:38.845
Allison, stop it! You need two hands!

01:07:39.180 --> 01:07:40.347
But I'm in the middle of the text.

01:07:40.598 --> 01:07:42.182
It's coming out!

01:07:47.438 --> 01:07:48.814
- Where is that coming from?
- What?

01:07:54.112 --> 01:07:56.113
I'm really sorry. I'm gonna
have to take this call.

01:07:56.322 --> 01:07:57.656
Is there a phone in my body?

01:07:57.949 --> 01:07:59.282
What are you doing?

01:07:59.408 --> 01:08:00.784
I'm in the Lincoln Tunnel.

01:08:00.993 --> 01:08:03.328
What? Okay, look. We
need to talk for a minute.

01:08:03.663 --> 01:08:05.622
Hello, Nadal. Listen, I can't speak now.

01:08:05.706 --> 01:08:07.207
I'll speak to you later, okay? Bye!

01:08:07.542 --> 01:08:09.459
Stop talking to my vagina!

01:08:10.795 --> 01:08:13.463
Zoey, the baby's stuck. I need you
to put your hand in and help me.

01:08:13.756 --> 01:08:15.006
- What? No...
- Come on! Put it in!

01:08:15.091 --> 01:08:16.800
- No, don't be scared. Put it in.
- Okay. Okay.

01:08:17.051 --> 01:08:18.385
- I'm sorry.
- Put it right there on the right side.

01:08:18.469 --> 01:08:20.386
- Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh!
- Push in.

01:08:21.555 --> 01:08:22.680
I think I feel an arm!

01:08:24.308 --> 01:08:25.308
That's my finger.

01:08:38.698 --> 01:08:41.241
Excuse me. You guys make a
really cute couple together.

01:08:41.325 --> 01:08:42.951
But maybe could you finish doing this

01:08:43.035 --> 01:08:44.995
when you're not elbow-deep in my pussy!

01:08:45.328 --> 01:08:47.538
Okay, Allison, you've got the head?

01:08:47.832 --> 01:08:49.582
- I've got the head.
- Okay, it's coming out.

01:08:49.667 --> 01:08:50.709
Come on, push!

01:08:53.171 --> 01:08:56.006
Where are the rebel bases?
Where are the rebel bases?

01:08:56.340 --> 01:08:57.883
Sorry, sorry.

01:08:58.176 --> 01:09:01.136
Wait, I can see the
head! I can see the head!

01:09:01.220 --> 01:09:02.345
I can't push anymore!

01:09:06.850 --> 01:09:09.269
You did it! You did it!

01:09:17.528 --> 01:09:18.862
I sentence you

01:09:19.197 --> 01:09:20.697
to life.

01:09:23.201 --> 01:09:24.283
It's still attached!

01:09:24.410 --> 01:09:26.368
Sorry. Oh, no.

01:09:26.537 --> 01:09:27.871
- What's wrong?
- I'm sorry.

01:09:28.080 --> 01:09:29.581
It's bad news.

01:09:29.916 --> 01:09:31.041
It's a girl.

01:09:33.169 --> 01:09:34.211
Where's the trash can?

01:09:34.420 --> 01:09:36.421
No, no, no, no! That's what we wanted!

01:09:36.714 --> 01:09:38.381
We'll take her, we'll take her.

01:09:38.466 --> 01:09:39.466
Oh, baby.

01:09:43.970 --> 01:09:46.805
You were so amazing down there.

01:09:47.140 --> 01:09:49.225
You saved a little person's life.

01:09:58.402 --> 01:09:59.986
It feels so nice to kiss you.

01:10:00.071 --> 01:10:01.488
I know. It's nice to kiss you, too.

01:10:01.572 --> 01:10:03.073
I love the hugging.

01:10:03.491 --> 01:10:04.908
I just came.

01:10:08.162 --> 01:10:09.663
I don't care.

01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:12.165
Lie back.

01:10:12.250 --> 01:10:13.291
Okay.

01:10:13.376 --> 01:10:15.043
This is going to be amazing for you.

01:10:15.127 --> 01:10:16.461
Okay!

01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:31.059
You have such a small stomach.

01:10:31.227 --> 01:10:33.520
It's like a
10-year-old boy's.

01:10:35.439 --> 01:10:38.066
Normally, I don't kiss a
10-year-old boy's stomach.

01:10:38.276 --> 01:10:39.484
They kiss mine.

01:10:40.861 --> 01:10:41.861
See you in 15 minutes.

01:10:45.283 --> 01:10:46.324
Okay.

01:10:55.376 --> 01:10:56.710
Wait, wait.

01:10:57.044 --> 01:10:58.378
Wait.

01:11:00.339 --> 01:11:02.507
Allison, before we go any further,

01:11:03.384 --> 01:11:05.468
there's something that
I want to tell you.

01:11:05.720 --> 01:11:08.305
You've got a dick. I knew it.

01:11:09.056 --> 01:11:11.182
Allison, I don't have a dick.

01:11:11.434 --> 01:11:12.684
Great!

01:11:13.060 --> 01:11:15.437
And I've never been
with a guy with a dick.

01:11:15.646 --> 01:11:16.938
Or any guy.

01:11:18.607 --> 01:11:19.649
Or boys.

01:11:21.819 --> 01:11:22.986
Just girls.

01:11:24.363 --> 01:11:25.447
And children.

01:11:25.948 --> 01:11:28.783
Not male ones. Female ones.

01:11:32.455 --> 01:11:34.706
What I wanted to tell you was this.

01:11:34.790 --> 01:11:37.959
I really want to be with
you, Allison Burgers.

01:11:38.794 --> 01:11:40.045
Zoey,

01:11:41.839 --> 01:11:43.923
I'm not really Allison Burgers.

01:11:45.009 --> 01:11:47.677
I'm actually a little somebody called

01:11:48.679 --> 01:11:50.680
Admiral General

01:11:51.390 --> 01:11:52.640
Aladeen.

01:11:57.063 --> 01:11:59.230
No, what's your real name?

01:11:59.440 --> 01:12:01.191
Wait, this will convince you.

01:12:03.027 --> 01:12:04.069
Look, it's me!

01:12:04.987 --> 01:12:08.156
The weapons inspectors will
bathe in their own blood!

01:12:09.575 --> 01:12:11.034
That's your beard?

01:12:11.118 --> 01:12:13.161
No, no, no! It's not my beard.

01:12:13.245 --> 01:12:15.288
My friend chopped the
head off Morgan Freeman.

01:12:15.748 --> 01:12:18.041
It's a hilarious story.
I'll tell you later, okay?

01:12:18.584 --> 01:12:21.878
You are out of your mind. You're insane!

01:12:22.046 --> 01:12:24.964
Well, you download songs
illegally from the Internet.

01:12:25.508 --> 01:12:27.050
So let's not throw stones, okay?

01:12:27.802 --> 01:12:29.135
You're a murderer!

01:12:29.470 --> 01:12:31.513
No, no, no! Zoey, Zoey, Zoey! No.

01:12:31.597 --> 01:12:34.849
You were just using me to
get access to that hotel!

01:12:34.934 --> 01:12:36.142
No!

01:12:36.227 --> 01:12:39.813
Zoey, I'm attracted to you
in a really fucked-up way.

01:12:40.314 --> 01:12:42.315
Oh, my God!

01:12:42.650 --> 01:12:45.193
I'm canceling that contract tomorrow!

01:12:45.653 --> 01:12:47.904
No, Zoey! What have I ever done wrong?

01:12:48.155 --> 01:12:50.156
You lied to me!

01:12:50.241 --> 01:12:52.659
And you're wanted for war crimes!

01:12:52.743 --> 01:12:54.327
That stuff never sticks.

01:12:54.912 --> 01:12:56.621
You need to leave now.

01:12:57.665 --> 01:13:01.126
You have broken my heart
into Aladeen pieces.

01:13:23.732 --> 01:13:26.109
With the signing of the
constitution tomorrow morning,

01:13:26.193 --> 01:13:28.695
democracy in Wadiya is just hours away,

01:13:28.779 --> 01:13:31.114
and people are in the
streets celebrating.

01:13:31.407 --> 01:13:35.452
Kill Aladeen, kill Aladeen, hey!

01:13:39.790 --> 01:13:41.624
What do you think of
Admiral General Aladeen?

01:13:41.750 --> 01:13:43.668
We hate him. We hate him.

01:13:43.794 --> 01:13:46.296
You know, when we think of him, we...

01:13:46.630 --> 01:13:48.965
We vomit, and we spit
and we don't want him.

01:13:49.175 --> 01:13:51.301
What would you say to General
Aladeen if he were watching this?

01:13:51.510 --> 01:13:53.178
I have a message for Aladeen.

01:13:53.679 --> 01:13:54.888
Suevel.

01:13:55.097 --> 01:13:57.640
Suevel. Suevel.

01:14:16.660 --> 01:14:18.244
- Good-bye! -
Stop, stop, wait!

01:14:18.329 --> 01:14:19.329
What are you doing?

01:14:20.664 --> 01:14:21.664
How did you find me?

01:14:22.249 --> 01:14:24.334
You texted me, like, seven times.

01:14:26.253 --> 01:14:27.921
I am executing myself!

01:14:28.255 --> 01:14:29.589
What? Why?

01:14:29.757 --> 01:14:31.299
Because no one has ever loved me!

01:14:31.675 --> 01:14:33.718
Your father would be ashamed of you!

01:14:33.802 --> 01:14:36.429
No, I've realized I don't
want to be like my father!

01:14:36.513 --> 01:14:39.057
In fact, I don't want
to be a dictator anymore!

01:14:39.141 --> 01:14:40.308
What's that now?

01:14:40.517 --> 01:14:43.311
I've been on a spiritual journey,
man, like Eat, Pray, Love.

01:14:44.563 --> 01:14:46.231
Have you gone insane?

01:14:46.482 --> 01:14:48.524
I now know that on the outside,

01:14:48.609 --> 01:14:49.984
I am a bit of a cocksucker.

01:14:50.277 --> 01:14:53.154
- Yeah.
- But deep down I'm nice.

01:14:53.405 --> 01:14:55.740
- Not really.
- Yes, I am! I'm like mafroom.

01:14:56.033 --> 01:14:58.159
Hard and spiky on the outside,

01:14:58.244 --> 01:15:00.328
but soft and really mushy on the in.

01:15:00.537 --> 01:15:03.873
You're not like mafroom at
all. You're like an onion.

01:15:04.166 --> 01:15:06.125
An outer layer of cocksucker,

01:15:06.210 --> 01:15:07.627
and when you peel it away,

01:15:07.711 --> 01:15:10.421
there is 10 more layers
of cocksucker underneath.

01:15:12.549 --> 01:15:13.883
You are such a schmuck!

01:15:14.176 --> 01:15:16.719
- Why are you speaking Yiddish?
- I picked it up.

01:15:16.845 --> 01:15:19.305
What do you mean, "I picked
it up"? Who picks up Yiddish?

01:15:19.390 --> 01:15:20.556
I'm in New York!

01:15:20.641 --> 01:15:22.892
We're trying to erase
that country off the map!

01:15:22.977 --> 01:15:25.061
I don't like the people,
but I like the way that

01:15:25.145 --> 01:15:27.814
their words really sound
like what they're meant to be.

01:15:27.898 --> 01:15:30.733
Oh, I'm sorry! Did I not get
the Evite to your bar mitzvah?

01:15:30.818 --> 01:15:31.985
Oh, my God!

01:15:32.069 --> 01:15:34.112
You've got real chutzpah saying that!

01:15:34.196 --> 01:15:36.406
Look, where has being a
nice guy gotten you, huh?

01:15:36.699 --> 01:15:38.908
Standing on the edge of a
bridge about to commit suicide?

01:15:38.993 --> 01:15:40.076
Still wearing Crocs?

01:15:40.744 --> 01:15:42.161
What's wrong with Crocs?

01:15:42.246 --> 01:15:45.248
They are the universal symbol
of a man who has given up hope!

01:15:46.375 --> 01:15:48.334
You might as well put sweatpants on

01:15:48.419 --> 01:15:50.336
and go to Applebee's for
the rest of your life!

01:15:51.380 --> 01:15:53.339
I'll give you that one.
I do look ridiculous.

01:15:53.424 --> 01:15:57.260
Yes! Listen, if you won't come
down from there for yourself,

01:15:57.344 --> 01:15:58.594
do it for your country.

01:15:58.762 --> 01:16:00.513
If this constitution is signed,

01:16:00.597 --> 01:16:03.808
there will be free press,
women drivers, civil rights!

01:16:04.018 --> 01:16:05.101
What are "civil rights"?

01:16:05.394 --> 01:16:07.645
I'll tell you later. They're hilarious.

01:16:08.147 --> 01:16:11.607
Look, you alone can stop these
terrible things from happening.

01:16:11.900 --> 01:16:14.485
You are the last great dictator!

01:16:14.903 --> 01:16:17.071
All of the others are gone! Qaddafi,

01:16:17.281 --> 01:16:19.782
Saddam, Kim Jong, Cheney.

01:16:21.827 --> 01:16:23.286
You are right, Nadal.

01:16:23.746 --> 01:16:25.830
I will become the
greatest dictator of all,

01:16:25.914 --> 01:16:27.915
the envy of madmen everywhere!

01:16:28.125 --> 01:16:29.709
Yes, Supreme Leader!

01:16:29.793 --> 01:16:33.171
From the mountaintops of North
Korea to the jungles of Zimbabwe,

01:16:33.255 --> 01:16:37.508
let every child laborer and
sweatshop factory worker sing,

01:16:37.593 --> 01:16:40.261
"Oppressed at last! Oppressed at last!

01:16:40.637 --> 01:16:43.431
"Thank Aladeen, I am oppressed at last!"

01:16:43.515 --> 01:16:44.682
Yes! Whoa!

01:16:44.767 --> 01:16:46.059
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
What are you doing?

01:16:46.143 --> 01:16:47.518
- No, no, no, no, don't fall.
- I'm not doing anything.

01:16:47.603 --> 01:16:50.271
Just do like a pull-up. You
know how you do pull-ups?

01:16:50.356 --> 01:16:51.564
I invented the pull-up.

01:16:55.861 --> 01:16:58.946
If you're just joining us,
we are at the Lancaster Hotel,

01:16:59.031 --> 01:17:00.740
where in about 20 minutes,

01:17:02.826 --> 01:17:04.660
General Aladeen will be signing
the new Wadiyan constitution.

01:17:04.745 --> 01:17:06.579
Dignitaries from around the world

01:17:06.663 --> 01:17:09.582
are arriving now to witness
the creation of a democracy

01:17:09.666 --> 01:17:12.460
that will undoubtedly change
the political landscape

01:17:12.544 --> 01:17:14.253
of the entire region.

01:17:14.505 --> 01:17:17.507
As Wadiya goes, so goes North Africa.

01:17:24.014 --> 01:17:26.808
Eddie Norton, next time, you pee on me.

01:17:27.101 --> 01:17:28.184
Whatever.

01:17:28.519 --> 01:17:30.520
And tell Viggo Mortensen
he is on my radar.

01:17:32.981 --> 01:17:35.358
How do you say, "Fly is in the soup"?

01:17:35.442 --> 01:17:37.276
Gentlemen, Tamir.

01:17:37.653 --> 01:17:39.779
Let me introduce you
to my beautiful wife.

01:17:40.322 --> 01:17:42.740
Mrs. Lao, it is my very great pleasure.

01:17:42.825 --> 01:17:44.992
No, no, no, no. She
does not speak English.

01:17:45.077 --> 01:17:46.285
Watch this.

01:17:46.995 --> 01:17:48.621
You ugly horse!

01:17:49.289 --> 01:17:50.331
She doesn't know.

01:17:50.958 --> 01:17:55.128
"Ohhh. " See? She goes
"Ohhh" all the time. Watch.

01:17:55.671 --> 01:17:57.338
Shaved ape.

01:17:57.923 --> 01:17:58.965
"Ohhh."

01:18:12.479 --> 01:18:15.481
Wait. That is how you intend to
get me across to the Lancaster?

01:18:15.732 --> 01:18:16.816
Absolutely.

01:18:16.900 --> 01:18:18.234
- Where'd you get that?
- I built it.

01:18:18.652 --> 01:18:20.903
When I was going to assassinate you.

01:18:21.321 --> 01:18:22.405
You mean my double.

01:18:25.075 --> 01:18:26.451
Sure. Yeah.

01:18:34.209 --> 01:18:36.127
Bingo!

01:18:39.173 --> 01:18:40.173
Love it!

01:18:40.257 --> 01:18:41.299
- Here's what you do.
- Okay.

01:18:41.383 --> 01:18:44.385
Zipline across, kill the double,

01:18:44.470 --> 01:18:47.054
and then rip up the constitution
in front of the world's media.

01:18:47.139 --> 01:18:48.139
Piece of cake.

01:19:02.529 --> 01:19:04.780
Hello, Lancaster!

01:19:13.749 --> 01:19:15.041
I don't understand what has happened.

01:19:15.125 --> 01:19:17.210
My calculations were very precise.

01:19:17.878 --> 01:19:19.837
If you lose enough weight,
then the zipline will work.

01:19:19.922 --> 01:19:21.631
Do you have anything in your pockets?

01:19:21.715 --> 01:19:23.382
Let me check.

01:19:26.345 --> 01:19:27.553
What is that?

01:19:27.638 --> 01:19:28.930
It's Vita Coco water.

01:19:29.556 --> 01:19:31.057
Why do you have Vita Coco water?

01:19:31.141 --> 01:19:33.809
Because it has as much
potassium as three bananas.

01:19:33.894 --> 01:19:35.478
The line is still too heavy.

01:19:35.562 --> 01:19:37.980
Is there anything else in your pockets
that could be weighing you down?

01:19:39.983 --> 01:19:42.818
You're kidding. So then why
did you bring three bananas?

01:19:42.903 --> 01:19:46.531
Because I don't trust the
advertising. I'm naturally suspicious.

01:19:47.157 --> 01:19:49.659
Is there anything else you're
carrying? You're still too heavy.

01:19:49.743 --> 01:19:50.868
Just this.

01:19:52.704 --> 01:19:53.829
What is that, a brick?

01:19:53.914 --> 01:19:56.332
All this time you've had a
brick? Why do you have that?

01:19:56.416 --> 01:19:58.334
Well, to balance out the
weight from the other one.

01:19:58.418 --> 01:19:59.669
You have two bricks?

01:19:59.753 --> 01:20:00.795
Yes!

01:20:00.879 --> 01:20:02.380
Throw them down immediately!

01:20:06.927 --> 01:20:09.387
Oh, my God! There's a
little goat eating the wire!

01:20:12.432 --> 01:20:14.267
You need to lose weight immediately!

01:20:14.601 --> 01:20:17.228
My pockets are empty. I could poo.

01:20:17.604 --> 01:20:19.188
That won't be enough
to make a difference.

01:20:19.273 --> 01:20:21.816
Yes, it will. I haven't
gone since Wadiya.

01:20:21.900 --> 01:20:24.527
Losing power has stopped
me up like a cork.

01:20:24.611 --> 01:20:25.903
Hurry!

01:20:25.988 --> 01:20:28.573
Come on, Supreme Leader!
Make it rain! Make it rain!

01:20:30.158 --> 01:20:32.410
It's out! And it's pointy!

01:20:33.453 --> 01:20:34.745
Somebody stop that man!

01:20:36.582 --> 01:20:37.623
Yes!

01:20:38.959 --> 01:20:40.167
What? No, no, no, no!

01:20:40.961 --> 01:20:41.961
No, no, no!

01:21:06.236 --> 01:21:07.778
Supreme Leader!

01:21:11.158 --> 01:21:13.326
Get out of here before Tamir kills you.

01:21:14.077 --> 01:21:15.161
Who is Tamir?

01:21:15.579 --> 01:21:16.954
Tamir...

01:21:17.039 --> 01:21:19.749
The bald bastard who did all
these terrible things to us!

01:21:20.542 --> 01:21:22.251
I thought his name was Dennis.

01:21:23.795 --> 01:21:28.466
How would you even make
that leap? Tamir to Dennis?

01:21:29.676 --> 01:21:31.677
- Go on, get out! Get out!
- Come on, Montzi!

01:21:31.762 --> 01:21:32.762
Quick!

01:21:35.974 --> 01:21:37.516
Just jump. It's not that far.

01:21:38.685 --> 01:21:39.935
Efawadh.

01:21:40.020 --> 01:21:41.687
It is almost time.

01:21:44.524 --> 01:21:46.859
I like goats.

01:21:48.028 --> 01:21:50.488
I am very stupid.

01:21:52.407 --> 01:21:54.533
This is an historic moment.

01:21:54.618 --> 01:21:57.453
Admiral General Aladeen of Wadiya

01:21:57.537 --> 01:21:59.038
is going to be signing

01:21:59.122 --> 01:22:02.792
the first democratic constitution
in the history of his nation.

01:22:02.876 --> 01:22:06.837
Across the globe, people are
glued to their television sets.

01:22:06.922 --> 01:22:09.507
The people of Wadiya are celebrating

01:22:09.591 --> 01:22:12.426
what will be a new
chapter in their country.

01:22:13.261 --> 01:22:16.180
Just moments away now
from putting his signature

01:22:16.264 --> 01:22:18.641
on the first democratic constitution.

01:22:19.393 --> 01:22:22.228
That's Tamir Mafraad,
Aladeen's trusted advisor,

01:22:22.312 --> 01:22:25.314
sharing a lighthearted moment with
Chinese businessman, Xiang Lao.

01:22:25.399 --> 01:22:27.274
Any thoughts on what they
might be saying, Mike?

01:22:27.359 --> 01:22:30.236
I thought I made out the
words "Harvey Keitel."

01:22:32.823 --> 01:22:34.448
Don't know what that meant.

01:22:34.533 --> 01:22:37.284
Maybe they shared a hot
dog together, I'm thinking?

01:22:37.369 --> 01:22:41.747
That would make sense. He's wiping
the mustard off his face and chest.

01:22:41.832 --> 01:22:43.124
Excuse me!

01:22:43.208 --> 01:22:44.667
You have to let me in.
You don't understand.

01:22:44.751 --> 01:22:46.419
He's trying to stop the signing!

01:22:46.503 --> 01:22:48.045
Tamir is now speaking.

01:22:48.130 --> 01:22:49.130
Today,

01:22:49.840 --> 01:22:51.590
we begin a new era.

01:22:52.134 --> 01:22:55.177
Wadiya will be open to the world.

01:22:55.262 --> 01:22:56.846
Open to the future.

01:22:56.930 --> 01:22:58.431
And open for business.

01:22:59.933 --> 01:23:03.352
The document is ready to
be signed, Supreme Leader.

01:23:11.945 --> 01:23:14.697
What are you doing?
This man is an imposter!

01:23:14.781 --> 01:23:19.243
No! This traitor tried to kill
me and had my beard removed!

01:23:19.327 --> 01:23:21.537
Look!

01:23:21.621 --> 01:23:24.039
Arrest the viper Tamir!

01:23:24.124 --> 01:23:25.833
And now in another

01:23:25.917 --> 01:23:29.545
amazing turn of events, Tamir
Mafraad is being taken away.

01:23:29.629 --> 01:23:32.173
This constitution

01:23:32.257 --> 01:23:34.925
is nothing but a
license for oil companies

01:23:35.010 --> 01:23:38.512
and foreign interests to
destroy my beloved Wadiya!

01:23:38.597 --> 01:23:42.266
Wadiya will remain a dictatorship!

01:23:52.027 --> 01:23:53.402
Oh, be quiet.

01:23:53.779 --> 01:23:56.781
Why are you guys so anti dictators?

01:23:57.032 --> 01:23:59.867
Imagine if America was a dictatorship.

01:24:00.243 --> 01:24:04.455
You could let 1 % of the people
have all the nation's wealth.

01:24:04.790 --> 01:24:06.248
You could help your rich friends

01:24:06.333 --> 01:24:08.876
get richer by cutting their taxes

01:24:08.960 --> 01:24:12.213
and bailing them out
when they gamble and lose.

01:24:12.672 --> 01:24:16.967
You could ignore the needs of the
poor for health care and education.

01:24:17.052 --> 01:24:18.719
Your media would appear free

01:24:18.804 --> 01:24:22.932
but would secretly be controlled
by one person and his family.

01:24:23.016 --> 01:24:27.269
You could wiretap phones, you
could torture foreign prisoners.

01:24:27.354 --> 01:24:29.522
You could have rigged elections.

01:24:29.606 --> 01:24:31.690
You could lie about why you go to war.

01:24:32.234 --> 01:24:34.026
You could fill your prisons

01:24:34.110 --> 01:24:37.738
with one particular racial
group and no one would complain!

01:24:38.073 --> 01:24:41.450
You could use the media
to scare the people

01:24:41.535 --> 01:24:45.454
into supporting policies that
are against their interests.

01:24:45.539 --> 01:24:48.916
I know this is hard for
you Americans to imagine,

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:50.960
but please try.

01:24:51.044 --> 01:24:53.295
I will tell you what democracy is!

01:24:53.713 --> 01:24:55.840
Democracy is the worst!

01:24:55.924 --> 01:24:58.843
Endless talking and listening
to every stupid opinion!

01:24:58.927 --> 01:25:01.011
And everybody's vote counts,

01:25:01.096 --> 01:25:04.765
no matter how crippled or
black or female they are.

01:25:05.684 --> 01:25:07.059
Democracy...

01:25:13.817 --> 01:25:15.109
Democracy

01:25:16.486 --> 01:25:20.614
has hairy armpits and
could lose five pounds.

01:25:21.825 --> 01:25:25.119
Democracy looks like a
midget in a chemo wig.

01:25:26.496 --> 01:25:29.915
Democracy, your mother
called the other day

01:25:30.041 --> 01:25:31.166
and I forgot to give you the message.

01:25:31.293 --> 01:25:35.379
It was something very important
about your grandmother.

01:25:37.090 --> 01:25:39.717
Democracy kisses you
because she wants to,

01:25:39.801 --> 01:25:43.679
not because her father is in the
next room chained to a radiator

01:25:43.763 --> 01:25:45.890
with electrodes attached to his nipples.

01:25:46.725 --> 01:25:51.061
Democracy is flawed! She is not perfect!

01:25:51.730 --> 01:25:53.230
But democracy,

01:25:56.776 --> 01:25:57.776
I love you.

01:25:58.903 --> 01:26:01.989
And that is why I call
for real democracy!

01:26:02.073 --> 01:26:03.866
A real constitution!

01:26:03.950 --> 01:26:05.909
And real elections in Wadiya!

01:26:12.542 --> 01:26:14.543
Oh, no!

01:26:15.420 --> 01:26:16.587
Come on!

01:26:23.470 --> 01:26:26.639
Democracy, I will make
you one of my wives.

01:26:27.724 --> 01:26:30.142
Okay, only wife. We'll vote on it.

01:26:30.769 --> 01:26:32.686
I'll shave my armpits for you.

01:26:32.771 --> 01:26:34.855
Praise be to the Creator!

01:26:34.939 --> 01:26:37.358
And please stop using
that organic deodorant.

01:26:37.442 --> 01:26:39.652
You could gas the
Kurds with that stench.

01:27:06.805 --> 01:27:08.722
You died protecting me, Efawadh.

01:27:09.474 --> 01:27:10.474
Hello!

01:27:10.767 --> 01:27:11.767
You are alive?

01:27:11.976 --> 01:27:14.937
Of course! It is my job
to be shot in the head.

01:27:18.608 --> 01:27:20.484
- Is he okay?
- He's fine.

01:27:20.568 --> 01:27:23.153
Luckily the bullet hit him in the brain.

01:27:24.280 --> 01:27:26.115
So,

01:27:27.575 --> 01:27:28.617
what now?

01:27:28.910 --> 01:27:32.246
I return to Wadiya to
participate in fair elections.

01:27:44.217 --> 01:27:47.761
Let's now look back at the
wonderful events of the past year.

01:27:47.846 --> 01:27:50.639
After Wadiya's first free elections,

01:27:50.724 --> 01:27:53.684
President Prime Minister
Admiral General Aladeen

01:27:53.768 --> 01:27:56.353
won 98. 8 % of the vote.

01:27:58.898 --> 01:28:02.484
But the big story today is the
marriage of President Prime Minister

01:28:02.569 --> 01:28:06.321
Admiral General Aladeen
and his new bride, Zoey.

01:28:10.577 --> 01:28:13.203
I now pronounce you man and wife.

01:28:23.047 --> 01:28:25.257
Are you okay, my love?
What did you step on?

01:28:25.341 --> 01:28:26.633
Oh, yes! No, no.

01:28:26.718 --> 01:28:30.387
It's my people's tradition. We
always smash a glass at weddings.

01:28:30.472 --> 01:28:32.306
- I'm Jewish!
- What?

01:28:32.390 --> 01:28:33.682
Mazel tov!

01:28:38.688 --> 01:28:39.730
Are you okay?

01:28:40.732 --> 01:28:43.400
That's fine. I don't mind. It's great!

01:28:43.860 --> 01:28:45.569
Come here, my love.

01:29:05.298 --> 01:29:07.174
Jachnoon, President
Prime Minister Aladeen.

01:29:07.258 --> 01:29:10.552
Jachnoon. Nadal. I have to be
back at the palace in an hour.

01:29:10.637 --> 01:29:12.930
Zoey thinks I'm at yoga.

01:29:13.348 --> 01:29:14.348
I have great news.

01:29:14.432 --> 01:29:17.226
We are just days away from
testing the new missiles.

01:29:17.310 --> 01:29:19.269
I have re-engineered
the oxidizing ducts

01:29:19.354 --> 01:29:20.813
and the payload delivery systems.

01:29:20.897 --> 01:29:25.609
But you'll be happy to know,
the missile is now pointy!

01:29:26.861 --> 01:29:28.821
Who cares if it's pointy?

01:29:28.905 --> 01:29:30.072
What?

01:29:30.573 --> 01:29:32.866
You do. You care if it's pointy.

01:29:32.951 --> 01:29:34.618
Why would I care about
such a trivial detail?

01:29:34.702 --> 01:29:36.954
Are you serious? Are
you serious right now?

01:29:37.038 --> 01:29:38.038
Of course I'm serious.

01:29:38.122 --> 01:29:39.581
That's why you had me executed!

01:29:39.666 --> 01:29:42.960
The shape of the missile has nothing
to do with the payload delivery.

01:29:43.044 --> 01:29:45.462
That's what I said! That's
what I said the first time!

01:29:45.547 --> 01:29:46.964
No, that's what I said,
and you went crazy.

01:29:47.048 --> 01:29:49.258
No! You said Professor Popeye this...

01:29:49.425 --> 01:29:51.176
Professor Popeye is a cartoon.

01:29:51.302 --> 01:29:52.553
No, I know this!

01:29:57.225 --> 01:30:00.394
So, we're opening 300 Women's Centers,

01:30:00.645 --> 01:30:04.565
but I'm going to have to take
a break for a little bit because

01:30:05.233 --> 01:30:06.608
I'm pregnant.

01:30:06.693 --> 01:30:07.860
What?

01:30:11.573 --> 01:30:14.074
Are you having a boy or an abortion?

01:30:37.640 --> 01:30:38.682
Hello, gentlemen. How you doin'?

01:30:38.766 --> 01:30:40.309
Are you guys friends of the deceased?

01:30:40.393 --> 01:30:43.186
Do you want me to say
this in front of his widow?

01:30:43.271 --> 01:30:44.313
I was his lover.

01:30:44.397 --> 01:30:45.898
No. That is not true.

01:30:46.316 --> 01:30:48.317
I saw him perform
with the Globetrotters.

01:30:48.401 --> 01:30:50.903
I thought he was
outstanding. I befriended him.

01:30:50.987 --> 01:30:53.113
No, it's a different person.

01:30:53.197 --> 01:30:56.533
His message of don't
worry and being happy

01:30:56.618 --> 01:30:57.784
was so powerful.

01:30:57.869 --> 01:31:00.120
No, this is Bobby McFerrin.
I told you this outside.

01:31:00.204 --> 01:31:02.456
Whatever the scandal you went through,

01:31:02.540 --> 01:31:04.374
you're still the best
golfer in the world.

01:31:04.459 --> 01:31:05.626
Let's go.

01:31:07.170 --> 01:31:08.545
O-M-G.

01:31:09.631 --> 01:31:11.006
Oh, my God.

01:31:13.926 --> 01:31:19.640
Oh, my...

01:31:25.980 --> 01:31:27.105
Zoey.

01:31:28.608 --> 01:31:30.817
That's some good head!

01:31:33.071 --> 01:31:35.197
That is called payback
and it feels so good!

01:31:35.281 --> 01:31:37.574
How did it feel for you?
How did it feel for you?

01:31:37.659 --> 01:31:39.451
I prefer it with goats.

01:31:40.161 --> 01:31:41.703
Where is the Supreme Leader?

01:31:41.788 --> 01:31:42.788
No, no.

01:31:42.872 --> 01:31:45.290
Now that is called payback!

01:31:45.500 --> 01:31:46.833
Oh, great!

01:31:52.256 --> 01:31:55.300
Don't touch it. Don't touch it.

01:31:55.760 --> 01:31:57.094
You don't have to touch it.

01:31:57.178 --> 01:31:58.220
Sorry. I was...

01:31:58.304 --> 01:32:00.138
Just give us... We don't...

01:32:00.223 --> 01:32:03.039
Just give me a couple
of millimeters to myself.

01:32:04.305 --> 01:32:10.514
