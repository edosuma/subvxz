No, I didn't.

-[Chloe] Brandon, he lied.
-[Brandon] It's okay. It's okay.

01:23.583 --> 01:25.460

Hi, Dad.

01:42.519 --> 01:44.729
-We were playing, and Chloe--
-Yeah, I heard.

01:48.149 --> 01:49.734
You used your powers, Chloe.

01:54.322 --> 01:57.450
He was the bad guy.
We're supposed to get the bad guy.

01:57.534 --> 01:59.369
We have these powers for a reason.

01:59.953 --> 02:01.204
And with great power comes--

02:01.287 --> 02:02.789
Great responsibility.

02:02.872 --> 02:03.706
[Dad] No.

02:04.207 --> 02:07.210
Well, yeah. [chuckles]

02:08.044 --> 02:11.798
Look, you have to care.
You have to care about people.

02:11.881 --> 02:14.342
You have to care about everything.
You have to know that…

02:16.136 --> 02:21.516
Look, it's easier to hurt people,
to get angry, to even kill people.

02:21.599 --> 02:22.433
But the bad guys--

02:22.517 --> 02:23.977
The bad guys are people too.

02:25.311 --> 02:28.356
So what do we do?
We stop them, and we lock them up,

02:28.439 --> 02:30.608
but we do not let
our anger get the best of us.

02:30.692 --> 02:34.988

those are the words we live by.

I know. I know.

03:10.732 --> 03:12.650
There's some people in trouble,

15:26.467 --> 15:27.927
-How you doing, Clyde?
-Hot as hell!

15:28.010 --> 15:29.929
You got that right.
Roscoe, what's the good word?

15:30.012 --> 15:32.681
-Wedding bells! That's the rumor.
-[chuckles] That's not a rumor.

15:32.765 --> 15:35.267
I'm walking down that aisle, pal.
What about you two?

15:35.351 --> 15:36.226
Hey, Shel.

15:37.436 --> 15:38.896
She finally pinned you down, huh?

15:38.979 --> 15:41.732
[chuckles] I couldn't be happier
to kiss the floor, Willie.

15:41.815 --> 15:42.733
You do right by her.

15:42.816 --> 15:45.194
You keep it zipped up tight,
you never have to fight.

15:45.277 --> 15:46.654
-Hey, Pop!
-What?

15:46.737 --> 15:47.905
Sorry about that, Mr. Sampson.

15:47.988 --> 15:51.283
No! And what did I tell you
about calling me "Mr. Sampson"?

15:51.367 --> 15:53.285
Come on, Fitz.
That ain't me. That's my old man.

15:53.369 --> 15:54.787
Ah, never mind him. [chuckles]

15:55.788 --> 15:58.540
-Congratulations, Shel.
-Hey, appreciate that. Thank you.

15:58.624 --> 16:01.168
-Have you seen my dad?
-With your brother, I last saw.

16:01.251 --> 16:04.380
-All right. Have a good day, boys.
-[Fitz] You too.

16:06.382 --> 16:10.678
[man] What are you talking about?
Fisher says it's a permanent plateau.

16:10.761 --> 16:12.262
[Sheldon] Good morning, boys.

16:12.346 --> 16:13.889
Shel, get him to listen.

16:14.431 --> 16:16.433
Dad, you listen to Walt.

16:16.517 --> 16:19.019
-What are we talking about?
-Your brother wants to sink the deal.

16:19.103 --> 16:19.937
What?

16:20.020 --> 16:24.191
You asked me to kick the tires.
I did. The tread's wearing thin.

16:24.274 --> 16:25.109
[scoffs]

16:25.192 --> 16:27.861
Every Joe Lunchbox with a spare nickel
is buying on margin

16:27.945 --> 16:29.530
with as little as 10% down.

16:29.613 --> 16:33.701
The market has been gaining 20% annually
since 1922. Fisher says--

16:33.784 --> 16:36.453
I don't give a fat, flying shit
what Irving Fisher says!

16:36.537 --> 16:38.330
-Hey! Language!
-Sorry.

16:39.915 --> 16:41.709
-Fisher could be wrong.
-He went to Yale.

16:41.792 --> 16:43.293
-Right?
-[Mr. Sampson] Yeah.

16:43.377 --> 16:45.087
Your little guys are overextended.

16:46.130 --> 16:48.298
-Agriculture is in a slump.
-[sighs]

16:48.382 --> 16:51.468
The Federal Reserve
just hiked interest rates a full point.

16:51.552 --> 16:53.262
Hoover knows what he's doing.

16:53.345 --> 16:56.473
So, everyone knows what they're doing
except me.

16:56.557 --> 16:58.308
Come on, Walter.
That's not what we're saying.

16:58.392 --> 17:02.730
Walt, we get it.
You're the glass-half-empty guy.

17:02.813 --> 17:07.443
Every company needs one of those
to keep feet nailed to the ground.

17:07.526 --> 17:10.195
But sometimes you gotta have faith.

17:10.279 --> 17:13.282
You've gotta step off that ledge
if you're ever gonna soar.

17:13.365 --> 17:14.700
That's right, Pops.

17:14.783 --> 17:17.578
Okay. Let's just…

17:19.538 --> 17:21.915
hold off for a few months.

17:23.667 --> 17:24.543
Months?

17:24.626 --> 17:27.421
The board is ready
to back the play now, Walt.

17:27.504 --> 17:29.840
We're about to break ground
on three new mills.

17:29.923 --> 17:32.509
Do you have any idea
how much a delay like that could run us?

17:32.593 --> 17:34.136
-I got numbers on that.
-Oh, Jesus!

17:34.219 --> 17:35.846
Yeah, of course he's got numbers on that.

17:35.929 --> 17:39.308
Walt, it's not about the money.
It's not about the numbers.

17:39.391 --> 17:42.478
It's about what we do,
and what we do is build,

17:42.561 --> 17:44.229
-not just with steel, but with people.
-Dad.

17:44.313 --> 17:45.981
Yes. And for some of these guys,

17:46.065 --> 17:49.109
the more we expand, the more good jobs
that we can give good men.

17:49.193 --> 17:51.070
A chance
to grab that American Dream, Walter.

17:51.153 --> 17:52.196
-Come on.
-Shel…

17:52.279 --> 17:56.075
Walt, it's not about the board,
or the Fed, or Irving Fisher.

17:56.158 --> 17:59.620
It's about people, Walt.
It's about family.

18:08.087 --> 18:10.589
[Grace] Okay, come on. Everyone, sit down.

18:10.672 --> 18:13.258
Mmm. That smells amazing.

18:13.342 --> 18:15.594
I mean, can my man cook,
or can my man cook?

18:15.677 --> 18:17.012
Looks great, Dad.

18:17.096 --> 18:19.348
Come on. It's Sunday dinner
It's not the Last Supper.

18:19.431 --> 18:20.766
Let's lower our expectations.

18:20.849 --> 18:23.352
Tell your old man
it's okay to take a bow once in a while.

18:23.435 --> 18:26.188
-I don't think he'll listen.
-I'll drink to that.

18:26.271 --> 18:29.525
Well, at least we're all on the same page.
Walt, are you forgetting something?

18:29.608 --> 18:31.777
[gasps] I'm sorry. Would you like a glass?

18:31.860 --> 18:34.071
You didn't have to bring anything.
We have plenty of wine.

18:34.154 --> 18:37.324
It's just a little Pinot I picked up
in Côte de Beaune on my way over.

18:37.407 --> 18:41.203
I'm not talking about the wine.
We say grace before we eat in this house.

18:41.286 --> 18:43.288
-Technically, I'm drinking, so…
-[Sheldon] Come on.

18:43.372 --> 18:45.791
-[chuckles]
-Join hands and close our mouths.

18:46.375 --> 18:47.292
[Grace chuckles]

18:47.376 --> 18:48.752
We waiting for Chloe?

18:50.379 --> 18:53.757
I think we've all eaten enough
cold Sunday dinners to learn not to.

18:55.759 --> 18:58.470
Lord, thank you for your generosity.

18:58.554 --> 19:00.097
[explosion rumbling]

19:00.764 --> 19:03.433
Thank you for the blessings
of the meal we eat today.

19:03.517 --> 19:04.977
[screeching, crashing]

19:05.060 --> 19:06.061
Oh!

19:07.312 --> 19:08.147
Look who showed up.

19:08.730 --> 19:10.440
-[Chloe laughing in distance]
-[door opens]

19:10.524 --> 19:11.525
[chuckles]

19:11.608 --> 19:12.860
-[Chloe] Uh…
-[Grace] Hi.

19:12.943 --> 19:14.611
-[gasps] Sorry.
-[Grace] Come in.

19:14.695 --> 19:17.739
Sorry. My agent called
just right when I was leaving, and I…

19:17.823 --> 19:19.741
-[Grace] It's okay.
-[Chloe laughs] Uncle Walt!

19:19.825 --> 19:21.451
[chuckles] Hey, kiddo. Oh!

19:21.535 --> 19:23.954
It's so good to see you. Are you okay?

19:24.037 --> 19:25.998
Uh, not if you squeeze me like that.

19:26.081 --> 19:28.292
-[chuckles]
-Sorry. Sorry. [laughs]

19:28.375 --> 19:29.543
Honey, honey…

19:29.626 --> 19:31.336
-Oh, is that Pinot?
-[Grace] Yeah.

19:31.420 --> 19:33.213
Honey, your dad was just saying grace.

19:33.297 --> 19:36.675
Oh. Sorry. Sorry. You were saying grace.

19:36.758 --> 19:39.011
-[wine pouring]
-All right, let's join hands.

19:39.887 --> 19:41.096
Chloe, come on.

19:41.180 --> 19:42.055
Hands.

19:44.474 --> 19:48.395
Thank you for our health.
Bless those who are in need.

19:49.646 --> 19:51.815
Please open our hearts to your love.

19:53.317 --> 19:55.986
We ask your blessing
through Christ, your Son.

19:56.528 --> 19:59.323
-Amen.
-[all] Amen.

20:00.282 --> 20:01.742
-Here you go.
-[clears throat]

20:01.825 --> 20:03.911
Mom, this looks so good.

20:03.994 --> 20:06.747
Don't thank me. Thank your dad.
He's the one that made it all.

20:06.830 --> 20:08.207
Go, Dad!

20:08.290 --> 20:10.375
Uh… [chuckles] Did Jesus help?

20:11.126 --> 20:13.754
-Only with the bread, honey.
-[Walter chuckles]

20:13.837 --> 20:16.215
-Come on, Chloe.
-[chuckling, coughing]

20:16.798 --> 20:17.883
That was a good one.

20:18.675 --> 20:20.719
If you made fish,
you could've had a runner.

20:20.802 --> 20:21.637
[Walter chuckles]

20:22.221 --> 20:25.182
-I saw your magazine cover, Chloe.
-[Chloe chuckles]

20:25.265 --> 20:26.475
You looked beautiful.

20:26.558 --> 20:28.143
Thanks, Uncle Walt.

20:29.186 --> 20:31.188
Uh, photographer was a real asshole.

20:31.271 --> 20:32.356
Language!

20:32.439 --> 20:34.024
Sorry. Sorry.

20:34.107 --> 20:36.443
He… he was a real anus.

20:37.694 --> 20:39.780
Hey, was that the one
that you did for InStyle?

20:40.322 --> 20:41.740
No, it was Marie Claire.

20:46.620 --> 20:47.704
You saw it?

20:48.705 --> 20:49.581
I did see it.

20:52.459 --> 20:56.463
It was… it was a beautiful photo, honey.

20:58.215 --> 20:59.341
-Beautiful.
-[chuckles]

21:01.260 --> 21:03.887
I mean,
you could've probably worn a little more.

21:05.222 --> 21:07.683
I could wear a lot less.

21:07.766 --> 21:09.017
If you wanna be naked.

21:09.101 --> 21:12.396
You wanna cover up your body
with a rubber suit and shiny boots,

21:12.479 --> 21:13.605
that's your kink.

21:13.689 --> 21:16.525
Your brother uses his gifts
to help the world be a better place,

21:16.608 --> 21:19.069
not to grab attention or endorsements.

21:19.152 --> 21:22.489
I don't need powers
to get attention or a job,

21:22.572 --> 21:24.741
-so shove your shit back up your ass.
-Oh! Chloe!

21:24.825 --> 21:26.618
Don't you ever talk like that in my house.

21:26.702 --> 21:29.955
"My house, my rules, my Code."

21:30.831 --> 21:32.916
I didn't ask to be your daughter,

21:33.000 --> 21:35.419
and I sure as shit
didn't ask for your gifts.

21:35.502 --> 21:37.754
Those gifts are not for you, Chloe.

21:37.838 --> 21:41.550
Those gifts are meant for people
who are less fortunate than you.

21:41.633 --> 21:46.013
Everyone's more fortunate than me
'cause they don't have you as their dad.

21:46.096 --> 21:46.972
[Grace] Chloe!

21:47.764 --> 21:50.267
Apologize to your father.

21:50.350 --> 21:52.894
-What? He started it!
-Apologize.

21:54.896 --> 21:56.106
Now!

21:58.775 --> 21:59.651
[huffs]

22:00.861 --> 22:01.862
I'm sorry.

22:03.280 --> 22:04.573
Thanks for dinner.

22:06.658 --> 22:07.659
[chuckles wryly]

22:10.370 --> 22:12.581
It's the last one I'm ever coming to.

22:16.418 --> 22:18.503
[door opens, closes]

22:21.757 --> 22:22.966
She took the wine.

22:26.011 --> 22:28.472
-[Brandon] Hey!
-Don't. Just don't.

22:28.555 --> 22:30.057
You don't know what I'm gonna say yet.

22:30.140 --> 22:32.184
You're not that complicated.

22:32.809 --> 22:35.312
I used to like that about you. [sighs]

22:36.313 --> 22:38.357
Why do you talk to him like that?

22:38.440 --> 22:41.318
Are you seriously sticking up for him?

22:42.152 --> 22:43.278
[scoffs] Oh.

22:43.779 --> 22:46.531
Of course you are.
You are his perfect little shadow.

22:46.615 --> 22:47.741
-Hey.
-[scoffs]

22:47.824 --> 22:48.658
Hey!

22:51.036 --> 22:54.164
Don't act like I forgot
what it was like to have him as a father.

22:54.247 --> 22:55.082
[Chloe scoffs]

22:55.165 --> 22:57.876
-I didn't get treated any differently.
-Then why stay here?

22:58.377 --> 23:01.713
Why subject yourself to this every day?

23:03.006 --> 23:07.469
Dad can't keep this up forever.
Somebody has to be the next Utopian.

23:07.552 --> 23:09.679
-Why?
-[Brandon] Because, Chloe,

23:10.263 --> 23:13.058
the Utopian stands for something.
He's a symbol. He's--

23:13.141 --> 23:14.142
He's a myth.

23:14.810 --> 23:15.977
[chuckles] He's a myth.

23:17.104 --> 23:21.775
Dad knows that he should have been
there for us when we were younger

23:22.484 --> 23:24.820
but won't admit it,

23:25.904 --> 23:28.824
because it's not the ideal.

23:29.658 --> 23:30.617
[scoffs]

23:32.661 --> 23:34.913
Someone still has to stand for something.

23:38.875 --> 23:44.047
No one can live up to the great Utopian,
Brandon…

23:46.758 --> 23:48.051
not even Dad.

23:49.803 --> 23:50.637
You know what?

23:51.138 --> 23:53.932
You're just jealous
that he picked me instead of you.

23:54.015 --> 23:55.767
I am not jealous, Brandon.

23:59.646 --> 24:01.148
I am sorry…

24:04.067 --> 24:07.696
that you think you have
to carry 120 years of his bullshit

24:07.779 --> 24:09.573
so Daddy will love you again.

24:13.660 --> 24:14.786
[whispers] You don't.

24:23.712 --> 24:25.213
[whooshing]

24:26.673 --> 24:27.507
[explosion rumbles]

24:35.724 --> 24:38.602
[Walter] You know they invented
this thing called a dishwasher?

24:39.394 --> 24:40.395
I like washing the dishes.

24:40.479 --> 24:42.772
It occupies the hands,
lets the mind wander.

24:42.856 --> 24:47.068
You know, drying is not as exciting.
Would you like to take over?

24:47.694 --> 24:48.695
Sure.

24:48.778 --> 24:52.240
I will be in not the kitchen
if you need me,

24:52.324 --> 24:54.367
so, uh, let's not need me.

24:55.327 --> 24:56.828
-[Walter] Good night.
-Mwah.

25:00.081 --> 25:02.250
She hasn't changed
since the day I met her.

25:02.334 --> 25:04.836
Yeah, thank God some things stay the same.

25:06.880 --> 25:08.173
Where did Brandon get to?

25:09.257 --> 25:10.467
He and Tectonic went out.

25:10.550 --> 25:14.262
I guess hanging out with the old man
isn't as fun as it used to be.

25:15.305 --> 25:16.806
That boy idolizes you.

25:16.890 --> 25:18.767
He's stubborn and thick-headed.

25:18.850 --> 25:21.561
Apple fell right next to you, didn't it?

25:21.645 --> 25:23.688
-Yeah, I guess so.
-[Walter chuckles]

25:25.398 --> 25:28.193
-He's a good kid, Shel.
-Yeah.

25:29.110 --> 25:30.862
Kid has a lot of potential.

25:31.947 --> 25:33.073
Anyone can see that.

25:33.156 --> 25:35.867
[sighs] The world's filled
with kids with potential

25:35.951 --> 25:37.077
who didn't make it.

25:38.161 --> 25:41.456
-They didn't have you.
-Yeah, well, tell that to Chloe.

25:44.334 --> 25:47.712
Rest of these can soak.
Let's you and me go for a ride.

25:47.796 --> 25:49.464
-Where?
-You're out of beer.

25:50.048 --> 25:51.299
There's half a case in the fridge.

25:51.383 --> 25:53.718
You're out of good beer.
Come on, dry your hands.

25:54.219 --> 25:56.513
["What's on Your Mind
(UnoMas remix)" playing]

25:57.472 --> 26:00.767
[crowd clamoring]

26:08.483 --> 26:09.609
Do you mind?

26:11.778 --> 26:12.696
Brandon?

26:14.072 --> 26:16.533
It's not every day
Paragon's out on the town.

26:16.616 --> 26:18.493
-Why don't you show 'em some love?
-Come on, man.

26:18.577 --> 26:20.203
You know
we can't be into self-endorsement.

26:20.287 --> 26:22.789
-[Tectonic] Wow.
-Not the example we should be setting.

26:22.872 --> 26:25.208
Didn't know
your dad would be joining us tonight.

26:25.292 --> 26:26.459
[bouncer] Back up. Back up.

26:26.543 --> 26:28.795
You know what? I think I might head home.

26:28.878 --> 26:30.630
Some of us have training in the morning.

26:30.714 --> 26:34.050
Whoa. Chill out, okay?
I haven't seen you in months.

26:34.676 --> 26:38.013
Have a shot for me. Please. Hmm?

26:38.805 --> 26:40.223
[crowd shouting]

26:41.057 --> 26:41.933
All right.

26:42.809 --> 26:45.395
Look, I know how much
you wanna be the next Utopian

26:45.478 --> 26:47.689
and the sacrifices you're willing to make,

26:47.772 --> 26:50.400
but you and I both know
what kind of a ball-breaker your dad is.

26:50.984 --> 26:54.529
Nothing is ever good enough for the man.
Everything falls short of his standards.

26:54.613 --> 26:55.572
You think I don't know?

26:55.655 --> 26:58.575
I swear, your pop and the original members
of the Union resent us

26:58.658 --> 27:00.702
'cause they had to go through
the worst shit imaginable

27:00.785 --> 27:01.620
to get their powers.

27:01.703 --> 27:03.830
I've heard this story a thousand times.

27:04.331 --> 27:08.668
I mean, you're right.
Not our fault we were born into this.

27:09.878 --> 27:12.631
Yeah. Then why accept the punishment?

27:13.506 --> 27:16.635
-I'm not giving up, Barry.
-[Barry] I'm not suggesting that.

27:17.260 --> 27:18.178
I'm just saying

27:19.763 --> 27:23.308
look at everything you've missed out on
trying to impress your dad.

27:23.391 --> 27:24.643
And what's it gotten you?

27:25.143 --> 27:27.687
In the meantime,
you're not living your life.

27:28.271 --> 27:30.106
You're definitely not enjoying the moment.

27:30.190 --> 27:32.692
Barry! Hi! Love you!

27:34.194 --> 27:37.781
I don't know. I think
my sister does that enough for both of us.

27:38.531 --> 27:40.200
Look how that's working out for her.

27:40.992 --> 27:43.370
I'm only saying all this because I care.

27:44.454 --> 27:46.414
I want you to be the next Utopian.

27:46.915 --> 27:48.667
But you can't put your life on hold.

27:49.959 --> 27:50.794
Cheers.

27:51.294 --> 27:53.588
["What's on Your Mind

[crowd cheering]

28:06.518 --> 28:07.686
[Sheldon whistles]

28:07.769 --> 28:08.770
Thank you.

28:10.814 --> 28:12.065
All right, Jane.

28:12.148 --> 28:14.693
-Tell Walt and your father I said hello.
-If they're lucky.

28:14.776 --> 28:15.860
[both chuckling]

28:17.320 --> 28:18.154
Bye.

28:22.826 --> 28:25.995
Hey, hey. Could you not whistle so loud?

28:26.079 --> 28:28.915
You damn near
split my skull half a block back.

28:28.998 --> 28:33.086
[laughs] George! Oh man!
Where the hell have you been?

28:33.169 --> 28:34.629
-[sighs] Rinsdale twins.
-Ah.

28:34.713 --> 28:36.381
Flew back east,
took the yacht up the coast.

28:36.464 --> 28:37.382
How far?

28:37.465 --> 28:38.883
Mmm. Nova Scotia,

28:38.967 --> 28:41.469
-before she caught fire and sank.
-Caught fire? What happened?

28:41.553 --> 28:43.805
Mary thought I was paying too much
attention to Margaret.

28:43.888 --> 28:45.724
Or was it the other way around?
I don't know.

28:45.807 --> 28:47.183
-[clamoring]
-Okay, what is going?

28:47.267 --> 28:50.562
-Whoa, whoa, whoa. What's going on?
-The stock market went tits up!

28:50.645 --> 28:52.856
You got money in the bank,
get it out, quick!

28:52.939 --> 28:54.691

[ominous music playing]

29:07.120 --> 29:09.372
-It's down another two and a quarter!
-Shit!

29:09.456 --> 29:11.332
Get Greenwald on the line
at National First.

29:11.416 --> 29:14.002
-He's not picking up.
-Well, get somebody on that damn blower!

29:14.085 --> 29:15.211
-Walt!
-Where have you been?

29:15.295 --> 29:16.671
-We just heard.
-How bad is it?

29:16.755 --> 29:19.591
How bad does it look?
Wall Street just melted down

29:19.674 --> 29:21.384
and burned a hole
to the center of the earth.

29:21.468 --> 29:24.387
-Down another three quarters!
-I told you it wasn't time to expand.

29:24.471 --> 29:28.266
And here we are, Shel,
jammed so far up the ass you can taste it.

29:28.349 --> 29:30.310
[indistinct chattering]

29:31.269 --> 29:32.187
Where's Dad?

29:34.022 --> 29:34.939
[Sheldon] Dad.

29:35.940 --> 29:36.775
Dad.

29:39.277 --> 29:40.445
What are you doing up here?

29:41.446 --> 29:42.822
Just look at this city.

29:42.906 --> 29:44.282
[sirens blaring]

29:44.365 --> 29:46.493
Sampson Steel runs through all of it.

29:46.576 --> 29:48.369
Okay, Dad, come on. We gotta go.

29:48.453 --> 29:51.289
[Mr. Sampson] We built something here.
We made something.

29:51.873 --> 29:54.375
The Prendergast building.
You remember him?

29:55.710 --> 29:57.629
Butch Prendergast.

29:58.505 --> 30:01.090
He had a dream. He came to us.

30:01.174 --> 30:04.511
So we gave him the steel
to put his first plant up.

30:04.594 --> 30:09.891
"I want to make boxes," he said.
"Everything needs a box. Every…"

30:13.561 --> 30:15.855
All your life, you try to build something.

30:17.190 --> 30:20.652
Try to build it bigger, better, faster.

30:21.694 --> 30:23.780
Build a legacy.

30:25.573 --> 30:26.991
Then, one day, it turns out

30:27.075 --> 30:31.079
you've been building your own box,
and you're the one inside of it.

30:33.373 --> 30:35.959
Everything ends up in a box, Shel.

30:38.127 --> 30:39.337
-[sighs]
-Okay.

30:40.171 --> 30:42.590
Come on. We gotta go.
They need you down there.

30:42.674 --> 30:43.508
[Mr. Sampson] Yeah.

30:44.175 --> 30:45.009
Come on.

30:45.969 --> 30:48.596
-You tell them I'll be right down.
-Okay.

30:52.475 --> 30:54.727
No! Don't, Dad! Don't!

30:54.811 --> 30:56.813
[dramatic music playing]

30:56.896 --> 31:00.358
Dad! Dad! [screams]

31:16.291 --> 31:18.918
When was the last time
we all sat around this table,

31:19.502 --> 31:21.170
the team from the beginning?

31:23.590 --> 31:24.591
Uh…

31:25.258 --> 31:27.051
Seventy… Sixty-something.

31:28.344 --> 31:29.721
Right before George…

31:32.140 --> 31:35.059
before Skyfox turned on us.

31:36.019 --> 31:38.396
[electronic humming]

31:39.439 --> 31:41.399
[Sheldon]
You ever thought about why he did it?

31:41.482 --> 31:43.234
[Walter] I know why he did it.

31:43.318 --> 31:44.777
He's insane.

31:44.861 --> 31:45.778
[Sheldon] Nah.

31:46.446 --> 31:47.697
He was a good man.

31:48.281 --> 31:52.160
[Walter] He's a terrorist, Sheldon.
He took the vice president hostage.

31:52.243 --> 31:54.245
[Sheldon]
He thought he was doing the right thing.

31:54.329 --> 31:56.122
[Walter] Yeah, so did Charles Manson.

31:58.082 --> 31:59.834
The Union of Justice.

32:01.419 --> 32:04.255
All these trophies,
all the battles we've fought…

32:05.214 --> 32:06.299
Hell of a thing.

32:08.217 --> 32:13.848
[chuckles] From thinking
you had a screw loose back in '29 to this.

32:20.772 --> 32:23.232
[sighs] Ninety years.

32:24.734 --> 32:27.654
Ninety years
of fighting wizards and robots,

32:27.737 --> 32:29.322
and what do we have to show for it?

32:29.822 --> 32:31.616
We've made a difference, Shel.

32:32.200 --> 32:33.368
Well…

32:35.787 --> 32:36.871
Quicksand.

32:37.455 --> 32:38.289
What?

32:39.248 --> 32:41.459
The country's never been
more divided, Walt.

32:41.960 --> 32:43.920
Congress is at a standstill.

32:44.003 --> 32:46.339
No one's willing
to meet in the middle anymore.

32:46.839 --> 32:50.093
The gap between rich and poor
just keeps getting wider.

32:50.176 --> 32:54.931
Kids learning active-shooter drills
before they even learn their ABCs.

32:55.014 --> 32:57.475
Nazis smashing up the streets, Walt.

32:57.558 --> 32:59.143
Not what they call themselves these days.

32:59.227 --> 33:02.397
Oh, they're Nazis. I don't care
what the hell they call themselves.

33:05.149 --> 33:07.443
[sighs] It's all sinking into the ground

33:08.987 --> 33:12.115
after all these years,
after everything we've sacrificed.

33:14.158 --> 33:15.618
Doesn't have to be that way.

33:18.496 --> 33:22.250
-If we played a more active role…
-Okay.

33:22.333 --> 33:24.627
…in helping
the administration shape policy, then--

33:24.711 --> 33:27.088
-Like George? Is that it?
-[sighs] George!

33:27.171 --> 33:29.215
It is against the Code.

33:29.966 --> 33:32.427
We don't kill. We don't lead. We inspire.

33:33.594 --> 33:35.888
The people of this country need
to make their own choices.

33:35.972 --> 33:37.765
Yeah, how's that working out?

33:41.269 --> 33:42.353
To this day,

33:43.354 --> 33:46.357
I still regret not doing more
in World War II.

33:48.693 --> 33:50.028
You talk about Nazis.

33:52.113 --> 33:54.741
We had the chance
to end the war a lot sooner,

33:55.950 --> 33:58.828
save countless lives
in Dachau and Auschwitz,

33:59.704 --> 34:03.416
take any discussion of the atomic bomb
completely off the table.

34:04.000 --> 34:05.001
And then what?

34:06.836 --> 34:07.837
Huh?

34:08.379 --> 34:11.632
Get involved with Korea?
Vietnam? The Middle East?

34:12.133 --> 34:14.886
Start dictating social
and economic policy?

34:16.763 --> 34:18.473
And where does that end, huh?

34:19.348 --> 34:22.560
And more importantly,
who is gonna stop us?

34:23.978 --> 34:25.688
It'd be the end of free will.

34:28.733 --> 34:30.610
Well, some would say free will

34:31.819 --> 34:34.197
is what's bringing the world to its knees.

34:35.990 --> 34:38.659
The days of making a difference
by stopping supervillains

34:38.743 --> 34:39.911
are over, Sheldon,

34:40.703 --> 34:44.749
now just memorabilia, nostalgia.

34:45.875 --> 34:48.461
The real evil today
is less black and white.

34:50.088 --> 34:52.924
Not bootleggers or gangsters.

34:54.592 --> 34:57.553
It's corrupt corporations, politicians,

34:57.637 --> 35:01.682
the quiet guy at work no one talked to
who just bought an automatic rifle.

35:02.391 --> 35:06.521
So you're saying the Code
doesn't apply anymore. Is that it?

35:07.772 --> 35:09.565
No, I'm not saying that.

35:09.649 --> 35:15.196
I'm just saying isn't all this
starting to feel a little repetitive?

35:15.279 --> 35:16.864
And do you really think

35:16.948 --> 35:20.451
just putting away bank robbers

35:20.535 --> 35:23.121
is gonna make the world
a safer, better place?

35:28.000 --> 35:28.835
[Fitz] Sheldon.

35:30.253 --> 35:34.382
We've got a situation in Nebraska.
It's Blackstar. He escaped the Supermax.

35:40.138 --> 35:43.391

35:47.228 --> 35:48.062
Hey, Ruby.

35:48.604 --> 35:50.815
The Union's fighting Blackstar
over the ridge.

35:51.315 --> 35:53.860
Blackstar? How did he get out of the 'Max?

35:54.443 --> 35:56.195
[man]
I guess he broke out. What do I know?

35:56.821 --> 35:58.990
Why aren't you over there, helping?

35:59.574 --> 36:02.285
You kidding me? I got flaming fists.

36:05.288 --> 36:06.873
Blackstar's got an antimatter heart.

36:06.956 --> 36:09.625
I'm hanging back.
Let the big guns soften him up,

36:09.709 --> 36:11.836
and I'll get there at the end
for the photo op.

-[bird cawing]

36:15.381 --> 36:17.550
Okay. That's a pretty good plan.

36:17.633 --> 36:18.926
Hell yeah, it is.

36:19.552 --> 36:23.556
-So who's all over there?
-Uh, Utopian, Lady Liberty, Brainwave.

36:23.639 --> 36:24.974
-Ugh.
-I know, right?

36:25.057 --> 36:28.227
-Who else?
-Flare, Phase Out, Ectoplex, Paragon…

36:28.311 --> 36:29.520
-Brandon's there?
-Yeah.

36:30.688 --> 36:32.231
I heard you two were a thing.

36:33.065 --> 36:34.692
We split up a couple weeks back.

36:35.985 --> 36:36.861
Huh.

36:39.614 --> 36:40.531
So, uh…

36:42.325 --> 36:43.618
what are you doing later?

36:44.202 --> 36:46.329

Walt! Get in his head and shut him down!

There. That's better.

40:04.568 --> 40:07.822
I've just separated your mind
from your physical body,

40:09.031 --> 40:11.200
trapping you in a psychic painting.

40:11.951 --> 40:13.619
It's one of my favorites, actually.

40:13.702 --> 40:15.955
Say hi to Blackstar, darling.

Hi, Blackstar.

40:19.125 --> 40:21.502
[Walter] Relax. This shouldn't take long.

40:22.086 --> 40:24.380
I thought it might be nice
to go somewhere quiet

40:24.463 --> 40:29.218
while my brother and the rest of the team
kick the living shit out of you.

He's not even close to being ready.

42:17.743 --> 42:19.245
He was gonna detonate, Dad.

42:19.995 --> 42:21.997
He was gonna take you out
and half the state.

42:22.081 --> 42:25.834
Then you disable his systems.
You… you send him into space.

42:25.918 --> 42:28.128
There's a million things
you could have done.

42:29.088 --> 42:30.798
You took the easy way out.

-Sheldon!

Go. Wait for me at the Union.

Our son took a life.

After everything we've taught him,
he broke the Code.
