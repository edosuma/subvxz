- Hi.
- Good morning.

03:32.311 --> 03:33.712
Mom.

03:33.746 --> 03:34.914
I made you scrambled eggs
and cream cheese.

03:34.947 --> 03:36.481
Your favorite.

03:36.514 --> 03:38.550
Can I take my car out after school?

03:38.584 --> 03:40.286
Yeah, as soon as I'm home from work.

03:40.318 --> 03:42.520
Can I go alone
if I stay close to the house?

03:42.554 --> 03:44.991
No, no... not until
the doctor says it's okay.

03:45.024 --> 03:47.659
Could you just please sit down
and have a bite of those eggs

03:47.693 --> 03:49.629

minutes in the kitchen over?

03:49.662 --> 03:51.296
You can't take your pills
on an empty stomach.

03:51.330 --> 03:52.598
Well, she's not hungry

04:16.889 --> 04:19.291

I don't know what that means.
You're talking about air?

04:20.892 --> 04:22.762
Why do I always
have to take her to school?

04:22.795 --> 04:24.562

You're not wearing your spirit bracelet.

05:51.783 --> 05:53.752
Ooh, I left it in the trash. Sorry.

05:53.786 --> 05:56.055
Did you now?

05:56.088 --> 05:58.023
Um, I was wondering if you

05:58.055 --> 05:59.591
wanted to go to the game Friday.

05:59.625 --> 06:00.992
What do you think?

06:01.026 --> 06:02.828
Uh, I think if I keep asking you,

06:02.860 --> 06:05.096
you know, my odds are
bound to go up, right?

06:05.129 --> 06:06.731

06:06.764 --> 06:10.002

06:10.035 --> 06:12.838

your batting average is shit.

Yeah, well, you know,
at least I play with heart,

06:14.673 --> 06:15.908
you know? And I'm not even, uh,

06:15.940 --> 06:18.110
a baseball player, lucky for me.

06:25.750 --> 06:28.653
And now, a player
who needs no introduction:

06:28.687 --> 06:31.557
number 32, Clay Boone!

06:33.524 --> 06:35.527
Now what's up, Reston?

06:35.560 --> 06:38.963
Are you ready to kick
the Rebels' ass this Friday?

06:38.997 --> 06:41.800
- Give me a W...
- W!

06:41.834 --> 06:43.502
- Give me an A...
- A!

06:43.535 --> 06:45.571
- Give me an R...
- R!

06:45.603 --> 06:47.205
- Give me another R!
- R!

06:47.238 --> 06:49.007
- Give me an I...
- I!

06:49.040 --> 06:50.942
- Give me an O...
- O!

06:50.975 --> 06:52.711
Katy, good work.

06:52.744 --> 06:53.946
You got a B plus.

06:53.978 --> 06:57.081
Townes, you got an A, again.

06:57.115 --> 06:59.084
Townes?

06:59.117 --> 07:01.487
Townes. Hey!

07:01.519 --> 07:04.156
- Townes.
- Uh, someone took my pen.

07:04.189 --> 07:06.158
Oh, come on. Not this again, Townes.

07:06.190 --> 07:07.692
Who took my blue pen?

07:07.725 --> 07:09.661
- My blue pen was stolen.
- Townes...

07:09.694 --> 07:11.863
- My blue pen was right here.
- Earth to Townes!

07:11.896 --> 07:13.031
- Sit down.
- My blue pen...

07:13.064 --> 07:14.699
Sick of you disrupting my class.

07:14.733 --> 07:15.867
- Someone stole my pen.
- Sit your ass down

07:15.901 --> 07:18.803
- before I tape it to your chair.
- My blue pen was stolen.

07:18.836 --> 07:20.706
I don't care about your pen.
Take a seat.

07:20.738 --> 07:22.807
- It was stolen!
- Look, you have a black pen,

07:22.841 --> 07:24.776
you have a red pen. You have two pens!

07:24.810 --> 07:26.545
- It was stol...
- Sit down!

07:26.577 --> 07:29.481
I have a question for you, Shelly.

07:31.115 --> 07:34.252
Why do we have to call you "Doctor"?

07:34.286 --> 07:37.122
You're not actually a PhD, are you?

07:37.154 --> 07:39.991
I actually looked you up, Mr. Gibson.

07:40.024 --> 07:42.126
You did your post-grad

07:42.160 --> 07:43.862
at the University of Cincinnati, right?

07:43.896 --> 07:45.931
Young lady, choose your
next words very carefully.

07:45.963 --> 07:47.266
Well, they publish

07:47.298 --> 07:49.100
their doctoral dissertations online.

07:49.134 --> 07:50.235
Okay, you know what? That's enough.

07:50.269 --> 07:52.071
Your Master's is there.

07:52.103 --> 07:53.705
It's a rambling piece of shit

07:53.738 --> 07:55.039
- but it's there.
- Principal's office, now.

07:55.072 --> 07:57.008
I just, like... it's odd that I couldn't

07:57.041 --> 07:58.710
- find your dissertation
- You know what?

07:58.744 --> 07:59.979
- Get to the principal.
- Don't touch me, dude.

08:00.012 --> 08:01.279
Let's go. Get out of my classroom.

08:01.312 --> 08:02.781
- Out of my class.
- I said don't... dude!

08:02.814 --> 08:05.584
Miss Coles, get out of my classroom.

08:05.617 --> 08:06.951
Uh, Miss Coles?

08:06.985 --> 08:08.187
Miss Coles?

08:08.220 --> 08:09.288
Uh...

08:09.321 --> 08:11.790
Oh, Jesus.

08:11.822 --> 08:13.758
Uh...

08:13.791 --> 08:15.093
Sit down. But... just...

08:15.127 --> 08:17.763
everybody just give her some space.

08:17.795 --> 08:19.163
Oh, God.

08:19.197 --> 08:20.598
Oh, shit.

08:20.632 --> 08:21.834
Stay back.

08:21.867 --> 08:23.802
Jesus Christ.

08:23.834 --> 08:25.537
Uh, please call someone.

08:25.571 --> 08:27.139
Uh... oh, God.

08:27.320 --> 08:31.082
Um... somebody...
somebody call the nurse.

08:39.116 --> 08:40.952
This is Henrietta's second

08:40.985 --> 08:43.556
myoclonic seizure in eight months?

08:43.589 --> 08:45.257
Actually, it's her third.
She had one at the house,

08:45.289 --> 08:47.959
but it was over so quickly
that we didn't bring her in.

08:47.993 --> 08:50.763
I noticed that you left some
of the questions blank here.

08:50.796 --> 08:52.965
If we want to get to the bottom
of these episodes,

08:52.998 --> 08:55.701
it would be helpful if we had
her father's medical history.

08:55.734 --> 08:58.137
Henry's father left
when she was a little girl.

08:58.526 --> 09:00.695
Is there any other family on his side
we could track down?

09:00.730 --> 09:01.880
I'm sorry, no.

09:01.907 --> 09:04.109
Okay, we're going to up the dosage

09:04.142 --> 09:06.979
of Henry's Carbamazepine
and Lamotrigine.

09:07.011 --> 09:09.013
Lucy at the front desk
can help you out with that.

09:09.047 --> 09:11.216
- Okay.
- Um, can I...

09:11.249 --> 09:13.218
What's going to happen with my license?

09:13.250 --> 09:15.286
Oh, yeah, Henry was hoping that

09:15.320 --> 09:18.223
she could get her license
back next month.

09:18.255 --> 09:19.891
I'm sorry.

09:19.924 --> 09:21.726
Unfortunately, that's not
going to be possible.

09:21.759 --> 09:23.828
I have to file with the DMV
this afternoon.

09:23.861 --> 09:25.264
Um, but the...

09:25.297 --> 09:28.367
the doctor last time said
that we could just

09:28.399 --> 09:31.971
not tell the DMV for now,
and we could wait.

09:32.004 --> 09:34.340
It's better for everyone
if you didn't drive,

09:34.373 --> 09:35.975
including you.

09:36.008 --> 09:38.177
If we can get these seizures
under control,

09:38.210 --> 09:41.947
you can re-apply for
your license in three years.

10:51.149 --> 10:54.919
We've had, uh, a rash
of incidents lately.

10:54.952 --> 10:56.454
Buddy Neil's RV,

10:56.488 --> 10:58.190
a billboard last night,

10:58.222 --> 10:59.791
uh, a school bus.

10:59.825 --> 11:02.161
I'm so sorry, officer.

11:02.193 --> 11:03.761
What were you thinking?

11:03.794 --> 11:06.230
You told me it was important
to express myself.

11:06.264 --> 11:08.400
Don't be a smartass.
You know that's not what I meant.

11:08.425 --> 11:11.369
You know, in most places,
tagging is considered an art form.

11:11.403 --> 11:13.072
You know what?
Here, it's considered a felony.

11:13.105 --> 11:15.074
Look, I'm not looking
to lock anyone up, folks.

11:15.106 --> 11:17.076
If she pays a fine,

11:17.109 --> 11:18.410
promises not to do it again,

11:18.442 --> 11:20.011
I don't have to bring her
before the judge.

11:20.044 --> 11:22.413
Thank you so much. I promise she will.

11:22.447 --> 11:24.283
Yeah, this will not happen again.

11:24.316 --> 11:25.783
You have my word.

11:25.817 --> 11:27.186
Thanks for this.

11:27.219 --> 11:28.916
Can I speak to Henry a moment?

11:28.941 --> 11:30.248
Yeah, of course.

11:38.797 --> 11:40.865
I know what it feels like

11:40.899 --> 11:42.934
to be the new girl in town, believe me.

11:42.967 --> 11:44.937
This particular town

11:44.970 --> 11:47.406
doesn't do newcomers well.

11:47.438 --> 11:48.873
But Henry,

11:48.907 --> 11:51.377
you have to find other outlets.

12:07.491 --> 12:09.995
You're not even trying, Henry.

12:10.028 --> 12:12.230
Why should I?

12:14.091 --> 12:17.754
Well, you know,

12:18.094 --> 12:20.945
this is a good opportunity for us, okay?

12:22.006 --> 12:24.104
We could really build a life here.

12:24.241 --> 12:27.764
I finally feel excited
to come home to someone.

12:29.039 --> 12:30.717
Mom...

12:31.149 --> 12:32.852
What?

12:33.818 --> 12:37.020
You've said that same thing
about, like, the last

12:37.121 --> 12:39.067
five guys that you've dated.

12:39.115 --> 12:41.758
- That is not fair.
- Yeah, it is. It is fair.

12:41.813 --> 12:43.127
Because this is what you do.

12:43.160 --> 12:44.362
You find some guy,

12:44.395 --> 12:45.869
you get sick of him,

12:45.917 --> 12:48.340
and then I have to move
to a new fucking town,

12:48.365 --> 12:51.619
and we have this conversation
every six months.

12:51.674 --> 12:53.171
Okay, was Burlington my fault

12:53.205 --> 12:54.379
when you stole that motorcycle?

12:54.404 --> 12:55.643
What about Newton?

12:55.674 --> 12:56.942
We had to leave
in the middle of the night

12:56.975 --> 12:58.284
because of Phil the asshole.

12:58.323 --> 12:59.545
That wasn't because of me.

12:59.577 --> 13:01.112
Okay, you know what?

13:01.145 --> 13:02.982
You're right, all right?

13:03.014 --> 13:05.082
But we've both made
some mistakes, and...

13:05.115 --> 13:06.518
this is different.

13:06.551 --> 13:08.086
Thomas is a good

13:08.119 --> 13:09.488
and honest man. Okay.

13:15.326 --> 13:17.495
Your father is

13:17.528 --> 13:20.064
not the person that you think he is.

13:22.100 --> 13:24.168
He was never around.

13:24.192 --> 13:26.672
He just came and went as he pleased.

13:26.735 --> 13:29.672
I never had any idea what was happening.

13:30.107 --> 13:33.578
I didn't ask you about Dad, so...

13:37.615 --> 13:39.427
Good night.

14:09.614 --> 14:10.820
Hey.

14:10.845 --> 14:12.979
We paid for two trailers.

14:13.551 --> 14:15.254
I'm only seeing one.

14:15.287 --> 14:16.989
Yeah, one of the drivers
lost his passport,

14:17.022 --> 14:18.590
and he's stuck in Ottawa, so...

14:18.623 --> 14:21.259
Why am I only hearing this just now?

14:21.293 --> 14:22.593
Sorry, Pop. I'll take care of it.

14:22.649 --> 14:24.339
No, you won't.

14:24.428 --> 14:26.130
You had your chance to take care of it.

14:26.163 --> 14:27.899
Now I'm gonna take care of it.

14:29.100 --> 14:30.635
Yes, sir.

14:39.244 --> 14:42.281
Um... what the fuck?

14:47.519 --> 14:50.489
Um... hi.

14:50.522 --> 14:52.324
Hey.

14:52.356 --> 14:53.991
What are you doing?

14:54.024 --> 14:56.495
We're selling your car, Henry.

14:56.520 --> 14:57.704
Why?

14:57.743 --> 14:58.878
You heard the officer last night.

14:58.903 --> 15:00.053
There's a fine to be paid

15:00.108 --> 15:01.243
and your car is gonna pay for it.

15:01.283 --> 15:02.843
But I'm... I'm gonna pay the fine.

15:02.877 --> 15:04.210
I've said that I will pay the fine.

15:04.235 --> 15:05.504
I'm gonna pay the fine!

15:05.537 --> 15:06.571
Really?

15:06.604 --> 15:08.006
Really? With what money?

15:08.038 --> 15:09.830
I don't got it.

15:10.375 --> 15:12.045
Mom!

15:12.644 --> 15:14.783
Mom!

15:15.791 --> 15:17.576
Mom?

15:18.712 --> 15:21.075
Mom.

15:22.187 --> 15:24.623
There have to be consequences
for your actions.

15:24.655 --> 15:26.257
Don't fight us on this.

15:26.291 --> 15:28.060
But I-I said that I would pay the fine.

15:28.085 --> 15:31.160
We made a decision, and that's final.

15:33.764 --> 15:35.716
I'm sorry.

15:43.375 --> 15:45.376
You know what the worst
thing about this car is?

15:47.412 --> 15:48.980
Nothing.

15:49.367 --> 15:51.596
It's awesome.

15:54.219 --> 15:57.481
Well... now you're stuck
being my chauffeur

15:57.521 --> 16:00.251
for the rest of the year, so...

16:01.060 --> 16:04.268
Don't know why you're so happy.

16:04.729 --> 16:06.264
<i>♪ See me sadness when we laugh ♪</i>

16:06.297 --> 16:07.800
<i>♪ When we quiet hear me work ♪</i>

16:07.831 --> 16:09.266
<i>♪ Feel me love and watch me ♪</i>

16:09.299 --> 16:10.854
<i>♪ Pull me switch drag me over ♪</i>

16:10.879 --> 16:12.378
<i>♪ Know me hard when me soft ♪</i>

16:12.403 --> 16:14.239
<i>♪ Know me scared when me talk tough ♪</i>

16:14.272 --> 16:16.641
<i>♪ Go get them guts go get them guts ♪</i>

16:16.673 --> 16:18.276
<i>♪ Cut then cut up your sleeve ♪</i>

16:19.644 --> 16:21.513
So freaking cool.

16:21.546 --> 16:23.248
Looks like an ancient symbol.

16:23.280 --> 16:26.183
Yeah, it's, like... Chinese? I think.

16:26.216 --> 16:28.153
Patty, your mom's gonna kill you.

16:28.186 --> 16:30.219
Yeah, she's not even gonna know.

16:30.587 --> 16:32.338
Hi.

16:33.057 --> 16:35.211
Hi, can I help you?

16:37.361 --> 16:40.064
Your sister isn't coming
with us on Saturday, is she?

16:40.097 --> 16:43.168
She's not my sister, and no.

16:43.201 --> 16:44.603
Did you guys hear
what happened last night?

16:44.635 --> 16:46.203
Michelle Reilley said that

16:46.236 --> 16:48.372
Clay hooked up with Tracy Stafford.

16:48.405 --> 16:50.274
Brenda...

16:50.307 --> 16:52.177
- Sorry, Patty.
- Why?

16:52.210 --> 16:55.247
You guys think I want Clay Boone back?

16:55.279 --> 16:56.680
Yeah, those sluts can have him.

16:59.484 --> 17:01.146
Did you know that there are six

17:01.171 --> 17:03.980
different kinds of generalized seizures?

17:04.320 --> 17:06.557
Your affliction interests me.

17:06.589 --> 17:08.797
I'm doing some research on the matter.

17:08.861 --> 17:11.297
No talking in detention.

17:21.472 --> 17:23.273
My pens began to move

17:23.307 --> 17:25.376
when your seizure started.

17:25.410 --> 17:27.876
So did other objects in the room.

17:28.145 --> 17:30.804
It was an abnormal occurrence.

17:31.389 --> 17:33.933
Do you have a brain tumor?

17:34.251 --> 17:35.619
Not that I know of.

17:35.653 --> 17:37.389
I was hoping you had a brain tumor.

17:37.422 --> 17:39.156
Brain tumors can cause

17:39.190 --> 17:40.659
psychic episodes.

17:40.692 --> 17:42.836
Shh.

17:43.795 --> 17:46.431
I didn't cause things
in the room to move.

17:46.463 --> 17:48.328
How do you know?

17:50.134 --> 17:51.603
Because

17:51.635 --> 17:55.940
no one can cause things
in a room to move.

17:56.588 --> 17:58.557
Well, I don't believe that to be true.

17:58.615 --> 18:00.201
Shh!

18:01.913 --> 18:04.115
You're crazier than I am.

18:04.259 --> 18:06.063
Do you know that?

18:07.317 --> 18:09.520
Swing the ball. Swing the ball.

18:09.554 --> 18:11.288
Whoo! Good edge.

18:11.321 --> 18:13.190
Hustle, Clay, hustle!

18:13.223 --> 18:14.419
That girl I was telling you about?

18:14.454 --> 18:16.255
She's got a sister.

18:16.361 --> 18:18.263
Her name's Candace. She goes to, uh,

18:18.296 --> 18:19.764
New Rochelle. She's a freshman.

18:19.797 --> 18:21.266
Oh, that girl has no idea
what she's in for.

18:21.298 --> 18:23.335
Stop talking, Clay, God damn it!

18:23.360 --> 18:24.311
What are you guys talking about?

18:24.349 --> 18:25.913
- Cut the chatter out there. Focus.
- Shut up, Munther.

18:25.947 --> 18:27.239
Rebound, rebound.

18:27.271 --> 18:28.373
- Whoo!
- Yes!

18:28.405 --> 18:29.773
Move the ball, move the ball.

18:29.807 --> 18:32.243
One of my drivers got stuck in Ottawa.

18:32.277 --> 18:34.778
Dipshit lost his passport.

18:34.811 --> 18:37.281
Yeah, I'll... I'll take care of that.

18:37.315 --> 18:38.517
Thanks.

18:38.558 --> 18:40.539
Stay on him! Come on, Clay!

18:40.571 --> 18:41.720
You dummy!

18:41.752 --> 18:43.621
I didn't raise a pussy,
but that's how you're playing

18:43.654 --> 18:45.856
out there, like a goddamn pussy.

18:45.890 --> 18:47.392
You got rocks in your head?

18:47.424 --> 18:48.926
Huh?

18:48.960 --> 18:51.496
I told you to drive and keep driving.

18:51.528 --> 18:53.431
I didn't even recognize you out there.

18:53.463 --> 18:56.500
- Where's the killer instinct?
- Dad, it's just practice.

18:56.534 --> 18:58.438
You play like you practice.

18:58.517 --> 19:00.223
You understand?

19:45.383 --> 19:47.919
We got to get you in.
That's what needs to happen.

19:48.138 --> 19:50.821
Uh, C-Clay?

19:52.019 --> 19:53.431
Clay!

19:55.792 --> 19:57.762
Can I talk to you?

20:08.439 --> 20:09.708
Hey.

20:09.740 --> 20:12.201
- Hi.
- 'Sup?

20:12.777 --> 20:14.748
I need a favor.

20:15.012 --> 20:16.637
Okay.

20:16.922 --> 20:18.644
What's the favor?

20:19.384 --> 20:22.470
I need to steal a car.

20:23.288 --> 20:25.271
You need to steal a car?

20:27.291 --> 20:29.321
Okay, um...

20:29.493 --> 20:32.019
You ever stolen a car before?

20:33.431 --> 20:36.385
Yeah, actually.

20:37.998 --> 20:39.324
So then, if you're so experienced,

20:39.413 --> 20:41.101
why do you need my help?

20:41.538 --> 20:44.133
It's parked in your dad's lot.

20:50.302 --> 20:52.437
Yeah, I think I can help you.

20:52.900 --> 20:54.206
Yeah?

20:55.319 --> 20:57.374
Okay, meet me after school.

20:57.587 --> 20:59.263
Okay.

21:04.828 --> 21:06.364
Hey, Gale.

21:06.396 --> 21:08.255
Hey there, Clay.

21:18.608 --> 21:20.577
Dad know you're down here?

21:20.658 --> 21:22.914
Jesus. Scared the hell out of me, man.

21:22.946 --> 21:24.081
What are you doing?

21:24.106 --> 21:25.642
Um...

21:25.717 --> 21:27.626
Nothing. I'm just...

21:28.419 --> 21:29.554
Just what?

21:29.586 --> 21:30.954
Just borrowing a car.

21:30.988 --> 21:33.857
Why are you in
the pink slip drawer, then?

21:33.891 --> 21:35.822
Uh...

21:36.661 --> 21:38.630
Okay.

21:38.663 --> 21:41.466
Never mind, hotshot.
I don't want to know.

21:48.005 --> 21:50.075
Am I the man, or what?

21:50.107 --> 21:52.452
Thank you. Uh...

21:52.676 --> 21:54.675
Thank you.

21:54.811 --> 21:56.380
Yeah.

21:56.413 --> 21:58.383
- Hi, babe.
- Hi!

21:58.415 --> 22:01.135
Dan Garvey's kid just spilled
split pea soup all over me.

22:01.198 --> 22:02.714
Just chucked it at me.

22:03.488 --> 22:05.423
What? What is it?

22:05.455 --> 22:07.591
Henry never came home after school.

22:07.632 --> 22:09.801
Oh, shit.

22:10.728 --> 22:14.208
Mark Weiner said she skipped detention.

22:14.898 --> 22:16.734
She's out of control.

22:16.768 --> 22:19.343
Don't... I called her twice.
It just goes to voice mail.

22:52.569 --> 22:54.672
Honey, what, uh...

22:54.751 --> 22:56.606
what are you doing?

22:57.107 --> 23:00.122
She is not getting past me tonight.

23:12.677 --> 23:14.518
- Hello.
- Hi.

23:17.662 --> 23:19.871
Thank you for this.

23:20.096 --> 23:21.300
Yeah, any time.

23:21.355 --> 23:23.601
You know, I think we make,
actually, a pretty great team.

23:23.701 --> 23:25.170
What should we steal next?

23:46.057 --> 23:49.093
So, uh, let me ask you something.

23:51.996 --> 23:53.865
What's your deal?

23:55.264 --> 23:58.635
Like... like, why are you always alone?

24:01.538 --> 24:03.508
Um...

24:03.740 --> 24:05.913
I like being alone.

24:06.042 --> 24:07.878
No one likes being alone.

24:11.015 --> 24:14.152
Yeah, well, you would think that.

24:14.184 --> 24:16.153
So, now all of a sudden you know me?

24:17.721 --> 24:20.191
Think everybody kind of knows you.

24:20.984 --> 24:23.309
- Okay. Okay.
- A little bit.

24:23.357 --> 24:25.659
Maybe they're wrong, though.

24:26.196 --> 24:27.920
Maybe I'm not what people say.

24:34.305 --> 24:35.740
What is that?

24:35.772 --> 24:37.107
In your hair?

24:37.141 --> 24:39.110
Oh, um...

24:39.143 --> 24:41.582
It's paint.

24:42.212 --> 24:45.955
- It's spray paint.
- Oh. Mm.

24:46.676 --> 24:48.118
Have I seen your work?

24:48.152 --> 24:50.521
I don't know. Maybe.

25:04.857 --> 25:06.591
Oh.

25:06.745 --> 25:08.281
Yeah.

25:44.040 --> 25:45.770
Um...

25:47.405 --> 25:48.956
Ah.

25:49.067 --> 25:50.469
Hey.

25:50.780 --> 25:52.820
I think...

25:53.017 --> 25:55.439
I think I should actually go...

25:55.494 --> 25:57.288
Go where? What are you talking about?

25:58.823 --> 26:01.555
Oh, okay. Clay, Clay, Clay, Clay, Clay.

26:01.625 --> 26:02.864
No, I'm...

26:02.896 --> 26:04.261
- Hey, don't worry.
- I'm being serious.

26:04.295 --> 26:05.997
Ow! Clay!

26:06.029 --> 26:07.764
- I just want you to feel good.
- Ow!

26:07.798 --> 26:09.666
That hurt! Ow!

26:09.772 --> 26:12.820
Henry, calm down. Calm down.

26:12.923 --> 26:15.073
Please, just get off of me.

26:15.105 --> 26:18.108
Ow, please, please, please.
I'm asking you to please...

26:18.142 --> 26:20.945
No, no, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

26:20.978 --> 26:22.246
No, please, please, no.

26:22.278 --> 26:26.250
I don't want... please. Please, no.

26:27.951 --> 26:29.621
See?

26:34.764 --> 26:36.667
I...

26:36.993 --> 26:38.869
See?

26:44.590 --> 26:46.908
You'll wet soon.

26:47.273 --> 26:48.639
Get the f...

26:48.665 --> 26:50.098
- Get the fuck off of me!
- Jesus, Henry,

26:50.138 --> 26:51.329
what's your problem?

26:51.360 --> 26:53.864
Get the fuck off of me!

26:53.911 --> 26:55.689
Henry, just stay.

26:55.928 --> 26:57.824
What the...

26:58.674 --> 27:00.691
Holy sh...

27:05.990 --> 27:07.659
Jesus!

27:25.710 --> 27:28.211
Uh...

27:50.366 --> 27:53.203
Henry? Are you up there?

27:53.703 --> 27:55.576
Um...

27:56.005 --> 27:58.386
uh... yeah.

28:01.479 --> 28:02.935
Henry?

28:03.012 --> 28:04.314
Yeah.

28:04.387 --> 28:06.149
Henry, is that you?

28:12.102 --> 28:13.865
How did you get in here?

28:14.476 --> 28:16.595
Uh...

28:18.873 --> 28:21.333
- Um...
- Where have you been?

28:22.730 --> 28:24.813
I-I don't...

28:26.465 --> 28:27.900
I don't know.

28:28.274 --> 28:30.591
What do you mean, you don't know?
Are you high? Look at me.

28:30.631 --> 28:33.972
No. No, I'm not!
I'm not... I'm just... okay, just...

28:34.111 --> 28:37.188
just listen to me for a second, okay?

28:37.268 --> 28:38.816
- I...
- What the f...

28:39.260 --> 28:41.109
Mom...

28:41.847 --> 28:44.254
I think something
really strange happened.

28:44.609 --> 28:47.444
What is... what has happened here?

28:48.627 --> 28:50.629
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

28:50.682 --> 28:51.928
What happened to the wall?

28:52.326 --> 28:53.695
Mom...

28:53.801 --> 28:55.603
- Just... okay...
- I just want to know

28:55.674 --> 28:56.801
if we should be expecting

28:56.834 --> 28:59.539
another knock on the door
from the police tonight.

29:01.300 --> 29:02.570
No.

29:03.364 --> 29:04.942
Um...

29:05.538 --> 29:07.149
No, that's not gonna happen tonight.

29:07.236 --> 29:09.006
I'm sorry.

29:10.047 --> 29:12.069
- It's perfect.<i>
- Yeah?</i>

29:12.133 --> 29:14.220
<i>You don't think it's, like, too big,</i>

29:14.245 --> 29:16.039
<i>or makes my ass look huge, or something?</i>

29:16.086 --> 29:18.823
No, it fits you perfectly.
You look gorgeous.

29:19.315 --> 29:20.718
Excuse me.

29:20.793 --> 29:21.826
Knock, please.

29:22.483 --> 29:24.015
Um...

29:24.706 --> 29:26.848
I-I need to borrow your car.

29:26.888 --> 29:28.745
<i>- What does the freak want?</i>
- I don't know.

29:28.793 --> 29:30.942
Jenna, where are your keys?

29:30.967 --> 29:32.444
- Dad!
- Jenna!

29:34.991 --> 29:36.302
I need your help.

29:36.364 --> 29:38.382
What is it, hon?

29:39.008 --> 29:41.112
Nothing, Dad.

29:41.690 --> 29:43.181
Good night.

29:45.274 --> 29:48.683
So, um, I... I was with Clay.

29:50.141 --> 29:52.111
You were with Clay Boone?

29:52.182 --> 29:53.984
Yeah, we were in his truck.

29:54.073 --> 29:55.225
Um...

29:55.259 --> 29:57.048
And we were kissing,

29:57.193 --> 30:00.897
and then he put his, um...
he tried to...

30:01.310 --> 30:06.056
But I said no, and...
but he wouldn't stop, and...

30:08.951 --> 30:10.988
- Henry...
- Um...

30:11.097 --> 30:14.454
And then he put his hand on my leg,

30:14.501 --> 30:16.294
- and then on...
- Are you okay?

30:16.343 --> 30:18.281
He put his hand down

30:18.849 --> 30:20.084
my...

30:20.722 --> 30:22.642
And...

30:23.293 --> 30:26.539
Um, and I said no, but he wouldn't...

30:27.634 --> 30:30.702
- Did he rape you?
- No.

30:32.544 --> 30:34.853
I mean, if... if I hadn't, he...

30:36.075 --> 30:38.435
And then I ended up here,

30:38.837 --> 30:41.961
and I... I don't... I don't know how...

30:42.831 --> 30:45.302
I don't know how I'm here.

30:45.414 --> 30:47.826
- Did he roofie you?
- No, he didn't roofie me.

30:47.882 --> 30:49.961
This is what I wanted to show you,

30:50.009 --> 30:53.168
because this... okay,
this is the weird part.

30:53.193 --> 30:55.415
Let me just... let me just show you.

30:56.225 --> 30:58.439
What is that?

30:59.574 --> 31:03.323
I think it's the door to Clay's truck.

31:06.593 --> 31:09.000
Well, how did it get here?

31:33.589 --> 31:36.159
Just wait here.

32:14.330 --> 32:16.132
Hello, 911?

32:16.217 --> 32:19.563
Um, yeah, I need to report an accident.

32:20.166 --> 32:21.638
Get in the car.

32:23.307 --> 32:26.344
Jenna, please don't tell
my mom or your dad, okay?

32:37.368 --> 32:40.291
This is so messed up.

32:40.523 --> 32:42.781
Might have been a deer.

32:42.869 --> 32:45.075
I seen a deer do stuff like this.

32:45.138 --> 32:47.264
Did a deer take the door with him?

32:47.472 --> 32:49.496
And put away the beer, Randy.

32:49.542 --> 32:51.382
This is a crime scene.

32:52.550 --> 32:54.452
Figure it was a hit and run?

32:54.587 --> 32:56.589
Well, maybe,

32:56.718 --> 32:58.888
but where's the paint
from the other vehicle?

32:59.033 --> 33:02.079
Think you all
should consider my deer theory.

33:40.466 --> 33:42.501
Is my boy gonna play ball again, Doc?

33:42.529 --> 33:44.404
Your son's a real fighter, Mr. Boone.

33:44.429 --> 33:46.490
He's got a very good shot
at pulling through.

33:46.522 --> 33:48.058
That said,

33:48.092 --> 33:50.046
Clay's spine was fractured

33:50.125 --> 33:52.776
at the second lumbosacral vertebra.

33:55.157 --> 33:57.235
I am sorry, Mr. Boone.

34:05.409 --> 34:07.344
What's going on?

34:07.945 --> 34:10.452
The Boone kid had a car accident.

34:11.301 --> 34:13.284
Poor kid was hurt really bad.

34:13.411 --> 34:14.684
It was a hit and run.

34:15.007 --> 34:17.054
They got a suspect.

34:18.538 --> 34:20.837
Did they say who?

34:22.726 --> 34:25.063
God help the poor son of a bitch

34:25.132 --> 34:26.975
when Bill Boone gets his hands on him.

34:30.438 --> 34:32.174
Hold on a second.
I was at home last night.

34:32.244 --> 34:34.838
You know, one piece
of advice for you: shut up.

34:35.232 --> 34:37.168
- Hey.
- Hey.

34:37.335 --> 34:39.938
Local news picked up this
arrest awfully fast, Sheriff.

34:39.985 --> 34:41.835
Ah, Clay Boone's a popular kid in town.

34:41.875 --> 34:44.116
News travels fast. This son of a bitch

34:44.156 --> 34:46.813
got blind drunk at the lodge last night.

34:46.862 --> 34:48.291
- Hold on...
- Just keep your mouth shut.

34:48.330 --> 34:49.382
Keep your mouth shut, you understand me?

34:49.418 --> 34:51.187
- Officer...
- And then he plowed his truck

34:51.243 --> 34:52.464
right into Clay's.

34:52.552 --> 34:54.989
I didn't know you lived
in the trailer park, Eddie.

34:55.029 --> 34:56.291
- No...
- No, no, his, uh...

34:56.339 --> 34:58.161
his mom's got a trailer over there.

34:58.735 --> 35:00.559
Where's Eddie's car? Is it impound?

35:00.624 --> 35:02.305
- 'Cause I'd love to take a look at it.
- It ain't at the impound.

35:02.368 --> 35:04.759
It's a hit and run, okay? Case closed.

35:18.503 --> 35:21.184
We need to just forget
about last night, okay?

36:01.670 --> 36:03.241
Hi.

36:03.427 --> 36:05.289
We are collecting donations

36:05.408 --> 36:06.829
to get Clay some flowers.

36:06.932 --> 36:08.083
That's so sweet.

36:08.170 --> 36:10.091
I'm so sad about Clay.

36:15.451 --> 36:17.487
Thank you very much.

36:19.742 --> 36:22.639
Certain types of seizures are recurring.

36:22.746 --> 36:24.768
Have you had another episode?

36:25.315 --> 36:28.450
I've been dealing with
some really weird shit, Townes.

36:28.751 --> 36:30.954
Define "weird."

36:33.356 --> 36:34.862
Something...

36:35.025 --> 36:36.827
something happened. Something,

36:36.957 --> 36:39.719
like, really strange happened.

36:39.791 --> 36:42.457
Strange like what happened
in the classroom?

36:42.565 --> 36:45.335
Did you move things
with your mind again?

36:47.304 --> 36:49.331
I-I don't...

36:49.572 --> 36:51.514
I don't really know what...

36:51.608 --> 36:53.418
I did.

36:53.976 --> 36:56.117
When did this happen?

36:57.481 --> 36:59.522
Last night.

37:00.349 --> 37:01.719
Hi.

37:01.751 --> 37:03.786
We're collecting donations

37:03.820 --> 37:05.762
to get Clay flowers.

37:06.322 --> 37:09.151
You had an episode last night?

37:09.693 --> 37:12.556
What is he talking about?

37:15.268 --> 37:17.612
Nothing. Um...

37:17.850 --> 37:21.972
I-I actually don't have cash, Patty.

37:23.606 --> 37:26.422
Otherwise, I-I would.

38:15.092 --> 38:18.009
Hi. Hello, Mr. Hope.
Sorry to disturb you.

38:18.081 --> 38:20.962
I need to speak to Henry's mother.

38:21.843 --> 38:24.287
She's not here right now.

38:24.768 --> 38:26.691
May I come in?

38:27.222 --> 38:30.158
So, last night, around 11:00 p.m.,

38:30.207 --> 38:33.428
there was a 911 call from Henry's phone.

38:33.610 --> 38:35.745
She reported Clay's accident.

38:40.550 --> 38:42.943
Henry called in Clay's accident?

38:43.954 --> 38:45.622
I don't see how that's possible.

38:45.720 --> 38:48.085
Well, it sure sounded
like her on the call.

38:49.059 --> 38:52.482
Officer, Henry was with us all night.

38:53.028 --> 38:54.130
You sure?

38:54.212 --> 38:55.453
Yeah, positive.

38:55.532 --> 38:57.468
She sat right there on that couch.

39:06.543 --> 39:08.603
Henrietta Coles?

39:11.652 --> 39:14.122
Just the little lady I wanted to see.

39:14.174 --> 39:15.418
Sorry, who are you?

39:15.452 --> 39:17.033
I'm Clay's brother.

39:17.351 --> 39:18.851
I know he...

39:18.986 --> 39:21.125
took your car yesterday off the lot.

39:23.527 --> 39:26.096
Yeah, I-I don't know
anything about that.

39:26.128 --> 39:28.030
No, I think you were with him.

39:28.078 --> 39:30.293
I-I don't know
what you're talking about.

39:30.356 --> 39:32.142
I'm sorry, man.

39:32.398 --> 39:34.547
Hey, I need to talk to you.

39:37.452 --> 39:39.704
Are you kidding me right now?

39:40.331 --> 39:42.712
- Let's go.
- But...

39:42.778 --> 39:44.608
Jenna, let's go.

39:44.648 --> 39:45.716
Go, go, go, go, go.

39:50.227 --> 39:51.258
I'm going.

39:51.322 --> 39:52.756
- Go, go, go.
- I'm trying!

39:52.822 --> 39:54.631
Okay!

40:16.929 --> 40:18.413
Shit.

40:18.514 --> 40:19.921
What's wrong?

40:20.009 --> 40:22.857
It's Clay's brother.

40:23.552 --> 40:25.188
What does he want?

40:31.126 --> 40:32.596
Shit!

40:32.628 --> 40:34.797
Jenna, drive. Jenna, drive, drive!

40:34.831 --> 40:36.033
Okay, I'm going, I'm going.

40:36.065 --> 40:37.951
Jenna, he's right beside us.

40:37.976 --> 40:40.070
- What do you want me to do?
- Don't listen to him.

40:40.103 --> 40:41.572
Pull alongside of the road.
You're not getting away.

40:41.605 --> 40:43.639
Henry, why is he following us?
What's happening?

40:43.681 --> 40:46.051
Hey, pull over!

40:46.764 --> 40:48.815
- What do you want me to do?
- Just drive faster!

40:50.713 --> 40:52.343
Shit!

40:58.439 --> 41:01.225
- Fuck. I'm sorry.
- Jesus, Jenna.

41:01.257 --> 41:02.625
Shit. Are you okay?

41:02.659 --> 41:04.228
- Yeah.
- I'm sorry.

41:08.097 --> 41:11.201
Um, okay.

41:11.538 --> 41:13.911
I'm gonna handle this, okay?

41:14.170 --> 41:15.806
What do you... what do you mean?

41:15.838 --> 41:17.325
Henry, get back in the car.

41:17.357 --> 41:19.929
Jenna, just go home. Go get help, okay?

41:19.992 --> 41:21.817
Go get help now.

41:46.235 --> 41:48.258
Why'd you run away from me?

41:49.005 --> 41:51.576
I just wanted to have a conversation.

41:52.675 --> 41:54.766
Well, I'm here.

41:54.919 --> 41:57.255
Let's converse.

41:57.880 --> 41:59.615
You're the last person to see my brother

41:59.648 --> 42:01.493
before the accident.

42:01.684 --> 42:04.721
Dude, I... I didn't see him.

42:04.753 --> 42:06.393
You're trying to bullshit
a bullshitter right now,

42:06.418 --> 42:07.520
because I know you're lying.

42:07.571 --> 42:09.698
I'm not. I'm not lying to you.

42:09.785 --> 42:11.198
I'm not.

42:12.695 --> 42:14.118
You sure?

42:16.800 --> 42:18.524
Yeah.

42:19.101 --> 42:20.670
I don't... I don't know
what you're talking...

42:20.704 --> 42:22.039
Okay, you're coming and you're answering

42:22.072 --> 42:23.941
- my questions.
- Hey, hey!

42:24.226 --> 42:25.496
Don't touch me!

42:25.544 --> 42:27.885
- Answer... Shut up.
- Hey! Hey!

42:28.260 --> 42:29.361
Help!

42:29.393 --> 42:30.780
- Shut up.
- Let...

42:30.813 --> 42:33.215
- All right, you know what?
- Help!

42:33.248 --> 42:34.750
Help!

42:34.784 --> 42:36.887
Let go of me!

42:36.920 --> 42:39.578
Help!

42:39.655 --> 42:41.221
Shut up.

42:42.257 --> 42:44.293
Hey! Help!

42:44.327 --> 42:47.775
Help! Help!

42:47.800 --> 42:50.633
Let... let me out!

42:50.699 --> 42:52.101
Hey!

43:01.744 --> 43:03.311
Let me...

43:03.380 --> 43:04.780
Let me out!

43:31.548 --> 43:33.230
Hey!

43:33.409 --> 43:36.079
Hey! Hey, stop! Stop!

43:36.112 --> 43:37.146
Cut it, Jorge!

43:37.179 --> 43:38.815
Cut the... cut the water!

43:38.847 --> 43:41.518
Hey! Hey!

43:41.598 --> 43:43.301
Help! Hey!

43:43.452 --> 43:46.200
Hey, don't worry about the vacuum.

43:46.272 --> 43:47.958
Hey, hey, just leave the car.

43:47.990 --> 43:51.368
Leave the car, Nick. I'll get it.
Can you just go?

43:53.396 --> 43:55.164
Let's go! Lomo, you don't need to...

43:55.197 --> 43:56.696
Come on.

43:56.766 --> 43:58.735
Come on, let's move it, guys! Hustle!

43:58.802 --> 44:00.971
You have legs! Use your legs.

44:01.029 --> 44:02.271
Jorge, you got legs.

44:02.313 --> 44:03.878
Can you just not walk any faster?

44:05.777 --> 44:09.142
Hey! Hey, I'm in here! Hey!

44:09.278 --> 44:11.213
Are you listening
to anything I'm saying?

44:11.246 --> 44:13.315
I'm giving you the rest
of the afternoon off, okay?

44:13.349 --> 44:14.451
Everybody happy?

44:14.483 --> 44:15.951
Okay.

44:19.489 --> 44:20.824
Okay, Henrietta.

44:20.856 --> 44:23.005
No more fucking around.

45:00.740 --> 45:01.874
Dad?

45:04.158 --> 45:05.814
Dad!

45:07.804 --> 45:09.538
Dad? Dad!
