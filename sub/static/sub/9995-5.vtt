Do you know it's not even 6:00?

02:52.380 --> 02:53.930
Sorry. I couldn't sleep.

02:53.940 --> 02:57.990
This whole meeting at the bank about the
home equity loan has got me all wound up.

02:58.000 --> 03:00.190
I just wanted to make sure
I had everything in orR.

03:00.200 --> 03:02.120
Yeah. It's got me a little crazy, too.

03:02.130 --> 03:07.890
I just had a dream about larry watt
saving our home from an evil banker.

03:07.900 --> 03:09.580
Larry watt?

03:09.590 --> 03:12.540
The callous and unprincipled
defense attorney?

03:12.550 --> 03:14.560
I thought you hated larry watt.

03:14.570 --> 03:16.720
Well, I don't hate him. Not him.

03:16.730 --> 03:19.940
Just everything that he stands for.

03:19.950 --> 03:23.810
Ask me who the evil banker was.

03:25.140 --> 03:26.790
District attorney van dyke.

03:26.800 --> 03:28.750
That really was a nightmare.

03:28.760 --> 03:32.860
So, if larry watt was the hero, and van
dyke was the villain, what role did I play?

03:32.870 --> 03:36.770
Well, you were strangely absent.

03:37.380 --> 03:40.660
I guess that's what I get for
leaving you in bed by yourself.

03:40.670 --> 03:42.490
You got an e-mail.

03:42.500 --> 03:43.550
Great.

03:43.560 --> 03:47.060
Whoever it is, whatever they're
selling-- we can't afford it.

03:50.810 --> 03:52.830
It's devalos. He's back.

03:52.840 --> 03:55.650
He's going to open his own practice.

03:55.660 --> 03:58.490
He thinks he might
have some work for me.

03:58.500 --> 04:00.020
Ariel: You look nice.

04:00.440 --> 04:02.250
Thank you.

04:02.260 --> 04:03.490
Job interview?

04:03.500 --> 04:06.100
No. A thing at the bank.

04:06.510 --> 04:10.660
Just trying to borrow some
money against the house.

04:10.670 --> 04:13.790
Just till we can figure out what's next.

04:16.980 --> 04:21.529
I don't know if you've noticed, but I haven't
really asked you or mom for my allowance in a while.

04:21.540 --> 04:23.140
No. We appreciate that, and I know...

04:23.150 --> 04:26.050
I know you've been using your-your
baby-sitting money for school lunch.

04:26.060 --> 04:27.960
- And it's fine.
- Sweetie, just as soon as we...

04:27.970 --> 04:29.620
no. I know.

04:29.630 --> 04:31.370
It's just that...

04:31.380 --> 04:33.230
there's this store at the mall.

04:33.240 --> 04:37.970
It's a makeup store, and a bunch of us
were going to go over after school today.

04:37.980 --> 04:41.640
And then I realized that I don't have
money for the bus or to buy anything.

04:41.650 --> 04:43.140
And I was just wondering...

04:43.150 --> 04:44.960
how much money are we talking about?

04:44.970 --> 04:50.920
Well, they have these cases with brushes and
makeup and everything, and it would be about $30.

04:50.930 --> 04:54.490
You need money today? Now?

04:55.090 --> 04:57.130
Ariel, I...

04:57.140 --> 05:00.350
sweetie, if I had $30 to give you...

05:00.360 --> 05:03.000
how much is the bus?
It's-it's two dollars each way?

05:03.010 --> 05:04.430
- Never mind, dad.
- No, sweetie.Hold on.

05:04.440 --> 05:05.740
- Dad, it's okay.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

05:05.750 --> 05:07.690
Here's four dollars.
Here's four dollars.

05:07.700 --> 05:09.260
Ariel. Ariel, honey!

05:09.270 --> 05:11.420
I'll see you tonight.

05:18.460 --> 05:20.720
No, no, no, no.

05:20.730 --> 05:21.720
This won't do.

05:21.730 --> 05:23.020
What won't do?

05:23.030 --> 05:25.470
We have a problem. You're
betterdressed than I am.

05:25.480 --> 05:28.460
If you don't open that
door, I'm going to kick it down.

05:28.470 --> 05:30.610
You've been warned.

05:31.030 --> 05:32.800
Hey, stranger.

05:33.090 --> 05:37.430
There is nothing more I would lovein this
world than to have youcome work for me, 

05:37.440 --> 05:42.360
but at the moment, I don't have
any clients, much less any work.

05:42.370 --> 05:45.090
No. What I meant in
mye-mail was, a, um...

05:45.100 --> 05:49.220
colleague of minewas asking about you.

05:49.230 --> 05:52.510
Wanted to know if I would
make anintroduction for him.

05:52.520 --> 05:53.510
A defense attorney?

05:53.520 --> 05:55.790
I've never workedfor a defense attorney.

05:55.800 --> 05:56.580
Interesting case.

05:56.590 --> 05:58.950
Man's accused ofkilling his wife.

05:58.960 --> 06:00.700
Well, what do you think?
Do you think he did it?

06:00.710 --> 06:02.480
I have no idea.

06:02.490 --> 06:05.890
Does it matter? It paysamerican money.

06:06.180 --> 06:07.780
Joe: The guy at the bank didn't
seem to think there'dbe a problem.

06:07.790 --> 06:10.590
It's just a question of
pushingthe paperwork through.

06:10.600 --> 06:12.800
He thought we'd have a
checkin a week, week and a half.

06:12.810 --> 06:16.760
Well, this mustbe our lucky day, 'cause
this meeting, or this job interview--

06:16.770 --> 06:20.900
which is I guesswhat it is-- shouldn't
take me morethan a couple of hours.

06:20.910 --> 06:23.010
I should bedone by 9:00.

06:23.020 --> 06:25.010
- Wish me luck.
- Luck.

06:25.670 --> 06:28.500
Girls? Come on!

06:29.320 --> 06:31.680
Dinner's onthe table.

06:31.690 --> 06:33.530
Don't give yourdaddy a hard time.

06:33.540 --> 06:37.660
Oh, make sure thatmarie uses her napkin.

06:37.670 --> 06:40.770
Don't be afraid toask ariel for help.

06:43.530 --> 06:45.750
ariel?

06:54.050 --> 06:55.150
dad, don't you knock?

06:55.160 --> 06:56.130
I did knock.

06:56.140 --> 06:59.020
Yeah, well, you're supposedto
wait until I say come in.

06:59.030 --> 07:02.140
I would have, but thenthere's this whole
issue of life expectancyto deal with.

07:02.150 --> 07:03.620
Besides, dinner'son the table.

07:03.630 --> 07:04.580
Your mom wentoff to a meeting.

07:04.590 --> 07:06.930
I could use yourhelp with marie.

07:06.940 --> 07:08.480
What's this?

07:08.490 --> 07:10.940
Uh, I told you, we were going to the mall.

07:10.950 --> 07:14.300
We went to that store, and I bought
that caseI was telling you about.

07:14.310 --> 07:16.910
Do you mind if I
ask, uh, how did you do that?

07:16.920 --> 07:18.500
What do you mean?

07:18.510 --> 07:20.800
I just bought it.

07:20.810 --> 07:23.450
Don't worry. I used my own money.

07:23.460 --> 07:25.520
Uh, but this morning, you made it
sound like you didn'thave any money.

07:25.530 --> 07:27.670
Yeah. Well...

07:27.680 --> 07:29.630
turns out I did.

07:30.310 --> 07:33.130
Who wantsdinner?

07:50.180 --> 07:51.700
hello!

07:52.620 --> 07:54.580
Hello?

07:57.800 --> 07:59.820
Hello!

08:03.990 --> 08:06.510
Hello?

08:07.570 --> 08:09.250
Is anybody here?

08:09.260 --> 08:10.810
Man:In here.

08:14.080 --> 08:16.560
larry watt for the defense.

08:16.570 --> 08:18.960
It's okay, mrs. Dubois.

08:19.210 --> 08:21.380
I'm not goingto bite.

08:21.390 --> 08:22.880
It's been a long time.

08:22.890 --> 08:25.110
I recognizedyour pitchfork.

08:25.900 --> 08:27.160
okay, I'm confused.

08:27.170 --> 08:30.020
Was it you whowanted to see
me? These aren't your offices.

08:30.030 --> 08:32.370
Yeah, well, don't beangry with manuel.

08:32.380 --> 08:36.409
If I had asked youto come to my
offices, would you have takenthe meeting?

08:37.230 --> 08:38.799
Yeah.

08:38.809 --> 08:43.780
No. My client, john edgemont, uses this
firm for his corporateand civil matters.

08:43.789 --> 08:44.830
Oh, I see.

08:44.840 --> 08:48.440
But whenever he's accused
ofkilling his wife, he hires you.

08:49.110 --> 08:51.680
allison, I knowyou're in a tight spot.

08:51.690 --> 08:56.410
And I also know, more than most, just how
effective you can bein a trial situation.

08:56.440 --> 08:59.190
I'm prepared to offer youa
lot of money to assist me.

08:59.200 --> 09:00.690
Assist you with what?

09:00.700 --> 09:02.890
My client's on trial for murder.

09:02.900 --> 09:05.640
Okay. Did he do it?

09:05.650 --> 09:07.250
I don't believe he did, no.

09:07.260 --> 09:09.290
How can you be so sure?

09:09.300 --> 09:13.060
Becauseyou'll meet him, and
you'll tell me, or maybe you won'T.

09:13.070 --> 09:16.260
Maybe you'll be justlike the rest
of us and help mount a great defense

09:16.270 --> 09:18.930
because you're being paidto do it.

09:26.070 --> 09:29.470
Think it over, but think quickly.

09:29.480 --> 09:32.980
Bank opens at 8:00.

09:37.560 --> 09:41.860
You know, he was kind of nice in
an oily, larry watt kind of way.

09:42.120 --> 09:45.030
Ah, that's the soundof the money talking.

09:45.040 --> 09:47.550
What, you don't like the
soundof the money talking?

09:47.560 --> 09:49.830
I love the sound of the money talking.

09:50.210 --> 09:54.130
I just hope thatyou're going to be okay
with everything youhave to do to earn it.

09:56.230 --> 09:59.920
how much money do you
thinkariel makes baby-sitting?

10:00.210 --> 10:02.160
I don't know. Why?

10:02.170 --> 10:06.460
Well, she wentto the mall today and
spent, like, $30at this makeup store.

10:06.470 --> 10:10.690
And when I asked herabout it, she insisted
that she did it withher own money.

10:10.700 --> 10:13.970
Okay. If that's what she
told you, what's the problem?

10:13.980 --> 10:16.760
I don't know. There
probablyis no problem.

10:16.770 --> 10:22.130
I mean I know thiswhole intuition thing
is more your neck ofthe woods than mine, 

10:22.140 --> 10:25.010
but I just gotthis feeling.

10:35.600 --> 10:39.690
Dad, can you pull
overand let me off here?

10:39.700 --> 10:41.410
What are youtalking about?
The school'sa block ay.

10:41.420 --> 10:43.410
I-I want to walk. Please.

10:43.420 --> 10:45.090
Okay.

10:52.010 --> 10:53.870
Thanks.

11:10.310 --> 11:11.220
Can I help you?

11:11.230 --> 11:12.670
My name's allisondubois.

11:12.680 --> 11:14.500
Uh, larry wattis expecting me.

11:14.510 --> 11:16.460
One moment.

11:25.530 --> 11:26.660
Mrs. Dubois?

11:26.670 --> 11:30.300
Attorney watt wanted me to ask youto
please meet him in the conference room.

11:30.310 --> 11:32.270
John, I'm just trying to help you.

11:32.280 --> 11:33.200
No.

11:33.210 --> 11:36.620
You're tryingto stage manage an event
that does not needto be stage managed.

11:36.630 --> 11:38.860
I did not killmy wife...

11:38.880 --> 11:41.930
therefore these
courtroomtheatrics are unnecessary.

11:41.940 --> 11:45.230
Uh, they, they just told me
to come straightin here.

11:45.240 --> 11:46.260
If this is a bad time...

11:46.270 --> 11:50.440
no, no, no, no, no. This, this
isa perfect time.

11:51.480 --> 11:53.340
Allison dubois, john edgemont.

11:53.350 --> 11:54.980
John, this is the womanI told you about.

11:55.000 --> 11:57.010
Used to work forthe district attorney.

11:57.020 --> 11:59.970
YeS. I'm very awareof
who mrs. Dubois is.

11:59.980 --> 12:04.530
I think she's going to prove to be veryuseful to
us, particularly this morningwith jury selection.

12:04.540 --> 12:05.790
Nice to meet you.

12:05.800 --> 12:07.570
Nice to meet you.

12:08.400 --> 12:10.020
You shookhis hand.

12:10.030 --> 12:13.220
Tell me what you feel.
Tell me what you see.

12:14.300 --> 12:17.310
nothing. I don't see
anything.I don't feel anything.

12:17.320 --> 12:18.310
Precisely!

12:18.320 --> 12:19.230
Wait! Wait.

12:19.240 --> 12:21.780
I'm confused. What's going on?

12:21.790 --> 12:26.050
Apparently mr. Watt must think that by shaking
your handI'm able to tellwhether you're...

12:26.060 --> 12:28.760
if I'm a man who couldkill his wife?

12:29.620 --> 12:31.130
So? What's the verdict?

12:31.140 --> 12:32.580
There is no verdict.

12:33.250 --> 12:34.440
Doesn't workthat way ever.

12:34.450 --> 12:36.540
At least it didn't today.

12:36.550 --> 12:39.380
So you have no opinionabout me?

12:39.390 --> 12:41.730
You seem like a nice man.

12:41.740 --> 12:45.180
I have trouble imagining
youhurting anyone.

12:46.310 --> 12:48.940
I appreciate that.

12:48.950 --> 12:51.420
Mind if I ask youropinion
about something?

12:51.430 --> 12:53.070
No, of course not.

12:53.080 --> 12:54.870
My, uh...

12:54.880 --> 13:00.430
my daughters, myra and chloe, they're
sitting in the, in the waiting area...

13:00.440 --> 13:03.520
I think I passed them on the way in.

13:03.530 --> 13:06.960
My attorney believes
thatit would be helpful

13:06.970 --> 13:10.190
if they were both presentin the
courtroom during jury selection.Do you?

13:10.200 --> 13:12.540
Don't be naive, john.

13:12.720 --> 13:13.790
We're picking jurors.

13:13.800 --> 13:16.470
These are the people who
aregoing to decide your fate.

13:16.480 --> 13:20.720
We need to paint a picturefor
them of who you are.

13:20.730 --> 13:21.890
Me, personally?

13:21.900 --> 13:24.340
I already like you better when
I seethat you have children.

13:24.350 --> 13:26.450
That the childrenare in your life.

13:26.460 --> 13:28.630
That they're in the
courtroomsitting there with you.

13:28.640 --> 13:33.400
Look, it goeswithout saying, the district attorney is
goingto do whatever it takes to win that jury over.

13:33.410 --> 13:37.140
But I could certainlyunderstand as a parent why
you wouldn't want yourchildren to hear the things

13:37.150 --> 13:39.300
that are going to be
saidin that courtroom.

13:39.310 --> 13:41.810
I'm not worriedabout my oldest.

13:41.820 --> 13:44.140
Myra's 18.

13:44.150 --> 13:45.890
I just...

13:47.450 --> 13:51.220
chloe is a few years
younger, and frankly...

13:51.230 --> 13:55.790
she's what people politelycall
"mentally challenged."

13:56.200 --> 14:01.130
Now, I'm, I'm, I'm not even sure that
she'll understandwhat's going on.

14:01.140 --> 14:07.780
And I'm afraid in the courtroom, with the
judge, and the lawyers, and all the loud talking...

14:07.790 --> 14:12.510
that, that she couldbecome frightened.
She, she can be very excitable.

14:12.520 --> 14:14.350
We're fighting foryour life here, john.

14:14.360 --> 14:18.520
It is my job to encourage you to
use every weaponat your disposal.

14:18.530 --> 14:21.770
Yeah, well...

14:21.780 --> 14:25.020
my childrenaren't weapons.

14:25.350 --> 14:30.260
I think I'm going to
askmyra to take chloe home.

14:30.670 --> 14:32.330
NoW.

14:32.340 --> 14:34.550
I'll be right back.

14:38.180 --> 14:43.480
I was scared to deaththat I was going to meet him
and something was goingto scream out "murderer!"

14:43.780 --> 14:46.640
But it wasthe complete opposite.

14:48.080 --> 14:49.370
What is so amusing?

14:49.380 --> 14:52.270
Nothing. I justthink it's funny
that you not onlywant to get paid, 

14:52.280 --> 14:54.790
but you want to be onthe
side of right as well.

14:54.820 --> 14:56.030
Oh, doesn't everybody?

14:56.040 --> 14:58.740
Well, honestly noteveryone
has that luxury.

14:58.750 --> 15:00.750
Well, right now I do.

15:00.760 --> 15:03.830
So please, stop rainingon my parade.

15:03.840 --> 15:05.160
Yes, ma'am.

15:05.170 --> 15:10.060
All rain will herebypromptly
cease and desist.

15:10.360 --> 15:12.410
It better.

15:12.830 --> 15:15.140
are you laughing?

16:30.040 --> 16:32.350
I'm just saying let's keepthings
in perspective, that's all.

16:32.360 --> 16:36.890
By "keeping it in perspective, " you really mean"don't
bite the hand that's paying our bills", don't you?

16:36.900 --> 16:38.130
What do youwant me to say?

16:38.140 --> 16:40.580
As little as possible.

16:41.200 --> 16:44.870
Look, when I workedat aerodytech, I did
a lot of thingsthat I didn't want to do, 

16:44.880 --> 16:48.050
but that was the job and they were
paying mea salary to get it done.

16:48.060 --> 16:50.110
I did those thingsbecause
I needed the money.

16:50.120 --> 16:51.290
Because we neededthe money.

16:51.300 --> 16:52.300
He is a murderer!

16:52.310 --> 16:54.070
He murdered his wifein cold blood.

16:54.080 --> 16:56.020
- You think.
- I know.

16:56.030 --> 16:57.270
Well, I don't knowwhat to tell you.

16:57.280 --> 16:59.750
'Cause last night you
"knew"that he was innocent.

16:59.760 --> 17:02.090
No, but you're right, you're
right. All right, let'S...

17:02.100 --> 17:03.950
you know, we'll givelarry
watt back his money.

17:03.960 --> 17:04.859
We'll live differently.

17:04.869 --> 17:06.800
We'll sell the house, we'll
move to a commune.

17:06.810 --> 17:07.839
Eat onlywhat we grow.

17:07.849 --> 17:08.650
We'll homeschool the kids.

17:08.660 --> 17:09.750
I didn't sayI was quitting.

17:09.760 --> 17:13.050
I didn't say I wasgiving the
money back. I just said...

17:13.060 --> 17:14.990
that this changes it for me.

17:15.000 --> 17:17.619
Yesterday it felt good.

17:17.630 --> 17:22.770
But I guess feeling good
isnot a perk I get this time.

17:26.589 --> 17:28.940
I'm going to drive the kidsto school.

17:33.720 --> 17:34.790
I'll see youthis afternoon.

17:34.800 --> 17:36.940
See you this afternoon.

17:54.250 --> 17:57.150
Hey, uh, I'm ariel dubois'father.

17:57.160 --> 18:00.040
I was wondering if I
couldtalk to you for a second.

18:11.690 --> 18:13.330
Watt:You're late!

18:15.490 --> 18:17.740
Not a terribly
auspiciousstart, mrs. Dubois.

18:17.750 --> 18:18.540
I'm really sorry.

18:18.550 --> 18:19.920
I should have been
herein plenty of time.

18:19.930 --> 18:25.090
I forgot that I didn't havemy official id anymore
and that they took awaymy permanent parking space.

18:25.100 --> 18:26.150
They made me go upto the third...

18:26.160 --> 18:29.070
the judge took
ill, there's no court today.

18:29.700 --> 18:34.240
I don't know why, but somehow I expected
you would have known thatbefore anyone else.

18:35.690 --> 18:38.630
Anyway, my boy had an epiphanylast night.

18:38.640 --> 18:40.900
He wants to testifyin his own defense.

18:40.910 --> 18:42.740
I told him I thoughtit was ill-advised.

18:42.750 --> 18:46.160
Of course, that onlyhardened his resolve.

18:46.910 --> 18:50.490
I thought we'd havea little rehearsal, a
little, uh, mock trialthis afternoon.

18:50.500 --> 18:53.250
Uh, attorney watt, I have to
talk to youabout john edgemont.

18:53.260 --> 18:56.370
No, actually. No.You don'T.

18:59.990 --> 19:02.980
You're not the only one with good
instinctsaround here, mrs. Dubois.

19:02.990 --> 19:05.290
I have a hunch that you're goingto
tell me something about my client, 

19:05.300 --> 19:07.760
something about our client
that I don't need to hear.

19:07.770 --> 19:08.760
Well, I think you do.

19:08.770 --> 19:10.250
I had a dream about himlast night.

19:10.260 --> 19:11.490
Oh, I'm sureyou did.

19:11.500 --> 19:14.690
But whatever you dreamtdoesn't change the
fact that there's a manaccused of murder

19:14.700 --> 19:16.410
who needs someoneto mount his defense.

19:16.420 --> 19:19.530
And speaking for myself
only, I'd like to be that someone.

19:19.540 --> 19:21.360
The pay is goodand the
work is interesting.

19:21.370 --> 19:23.370
And if you'd like to bethat someone, too, 

19:23.380 --> 19:25.010
you change the subjectand
change it quickly

19:25.020 --> 19:29.860
because whatever you thinkabout me you should
know that I'm notkeen on suborning perjury.

19:30.470 --> 19:34.810
Now, john edgemont wants to tell
his sideof the story to that jury

19:34.820 --> 19:39.460
and you know as well as I do that i can't
put him on thestand if I know he's guilty.

19:47.920 --> 19:49.430
good.

19:49.440 --> 19:52.270
I'm glad we
seeeye-to-eye on this.

19:53.310 --> 19:55.690
We'll reconvene at 2:00.

19:57.840 --> 20:00.110
You might want to show uparound 1:45.

20:00.120 --> 20:02.270
Parking can be trickyat that building.

20:04.670 --> 20:08.280
So you admit that you and yourwife
fought on the nightof her death.

20:08.290 --> 20:10.030
Yes, we had an argument.

20:10.040 --> 20:11.660
What about?

20:11.670 --> 20:14.610
The children. My children.

20:15.310 --> 20:20.430
myra's a, a freshmanat college and she's
taken to coming and goingas she pleases.

20:20.440 --> 20:24.430
Stacey thought we shouldlay down
some ground rules about her hours.

20:24.440 --> 20:26.890
Or insist thatshe move to campus.

20:26.900 --> 20:28.020
Stay in a dorm.

20:28.040 --> 20:29.840
And you disagreed?

20:29.860 --> 20:33.180
I like having my
childrenwith me at home.

20:33.190 --> 20:35.550
I just...

20:35.950 --> 20:37.600
I like it.

20:37.610 --> 20:41.370
And is myrathe only thing that
you two disagreedabout that night?

20:41.380 --> 20:42.580
No.

20:42.590 --> 20:44.900
No, we also hada
conversation about chloe.

20:44.910 --> 20:45.950
What about chloe?

20:45.970 --> 20:47.950
She requires a lot
ofattention, doesn't she?

20:47.960 --> 20:51.590
Yes, chloe requiresconstant supervision.

20:51.600 --> 20:54.030
We have nurses, but it's, it's, uh...

20:54.040 --> 20:56.570
it's always difficultto have...

20:56.580 --> 20:59.770
a child with special needsat homE.

21:01.150 --> 21:05.100
stacey didn't have a lotof patience.

21:05.110 --> 21:07.980
She felt that we shouldput
chloe in a facility.

21:07.990 --> 21:09.020
In an institution?

21:09.030 --> 21:09.950
That's right.

21:09.960 --> 21:11.550
And again, you...

21:11.570 --> 21:13.260
you didn't agree.

21:13.270 --> 21:16.700
I was fairly adamant that bothmy
children should live at home.

21:16.710 --> 21:18.810
Watt:W-wait a second.

21:19.590 --> 21:21.360
Let's talk about this word"adamant."

21:21.370 --> 21:23.270
It conjures up allsorts of images.

21:23.280 --> 21:25.370
It makes you sound intractable.

21:25.380 --> 21:27.080
Let me makesomething clear here.

21:27.090 --> 21:29.820
No one is asking you to lie.

21:29.830 --> 21:33.580
But it would be veryhelpful to our cause
if somehow this jurywas made to believe that

21:33.590 --> 21:38.280
the ideaof sending chloe away was something
you might havereluctantly considered.

21:38.290 --> 21:41.110
Myra:But it's just not true.

21:41.120 --> 21:44.300
My father would neverput
chloe in an institution.

21:44.320 --> 21:46.460
We're a family. She
belongs at home with us.

21:46.470 --> 21:49.730
I know that, ms.
Edgemont, and I admire it.

21:49.740 --> 21:52.490
But without lying aboutany of
the material facts of this case, 

21:52.500 --> 21:56.320
we have to paint a picturefor
the jury on who your father is.

21:56.330 --> 22:00.890
We want it to be impossiblefor them to
imagine that he's done thishorrible thing.

22:01.370 --> 22:03.110
We're fighting foryour
father's life here.

22:03.120 --> 22:05.040
She understands.

22:05.050 --> 22:06.930
We both understand.

22:07.560 --> 22:08.810
I'll, um...

22:08.820 --> 22:12.130
I'll try to avoidusing
the word "adamant."

22:12.420 --> 22:14.710
All right, fine.

22:15.120 --> 22:17.290
All right, so...

22:17.300 --> 22:19.710
that's a lot of stress on
a new marriage, isn't it?

22:19.720 --> 22:20.700
Yes.

22:20.710 --> 22:23.160
That night, you fought.

22:23.520 --> 22:25.620
Yes, we did.

22:26.200 --> 22:30.770
And you claimthat your wife went
out for a driveto clear her head.

22:30.780 --> 22:32.410
That's what she did.

22:32.420 --> 22:34.900
And you didn't worry whenshe
failed to return home?

22:34.910 --> 22:37.200
Of course I worried.

22:37.210 --> 22:39.620
And the longer she
wasgone, the more I worried.

22:39.630 --> 22:43.710
I couldn't raise heron the cell
phone, we just had an argument.

22:43.720 --> 22:47.310
I mean, I guess I was
hoping shewas cooling down.

22:47.620 --> 22:49.830
I guess I was hopingshe'd call me.

22:49.840 --> 22:54.540
And finally, just before
4:00, I called the police.

23:24.810 --> 23:26.560
it's done.

23:26.570 --> 23:29.740
Okay. Good.

23:29.750 --> 23:33.010
Really? I'm not so sure.

23:33.020 --> 23:37.340
Dad, you know whatwould've
happened if you told themthe truth.

23:37.350 --> 23:39.410
They would'vetaken chloe away.

23:39.420 --> 23:41.270
To an institution.

23:41.280 --> 23:43.610
Or worse, prison.

23:43.620 --> 23:45.720
It's not likewe had a choice.

23:45.730 --> 23:47.400
Now, you promisedmother.

23:47.410 --> 23:49.970
You promised you
wouldnever send chloe away.

23:49.980 --> 23:53.300
I know. I know I did.

23:53.580 --> 23:57.910
But myra, this isn't the
first timeshe's hurt someone.

23:57.920 --> 24:00.480
But dad, you knowit isn't intentional.

24:00.490 --> 24:02.400
She isn't capable.

24:02.410 --> 24:05.680
She just getsfrustrated. She
doesn't knowher own strength.

24:06.330 --> 24:10.470
I know. I know that.

24:12.110 --> 24:15.090
Stacey wasn'tthe best stepmother.

24:15.100 --> 24:18.080
And she wasn't the best wife.

24:18.490 --> 24:21.640
But she didn't deserveto die like that.

24:21.650 --> 24:23.530
Nobody does.

24:23.540 --> 24:29.490
For the last time, mr. Edgemont, did
you or did younot kill your wife?

24:29.500 --> 24:33.000
No. I did not.

24:39.490 --> 24:43.910
Look, dad, mom's homefrom work
exactly when we got home from school.

24:47.980 --> 24:50.130
Hi, mom, how was your day? Mine was good.

24:50.140 --> 24:52.840
We had sloppy joes for lunch.

24:52.850 --> 24:55.370
I never actually hada sloppy joe before.

24:55.380 --> 24:57.080
Except I reallylike them.

24:57.090 --> 25:00.780
This kid named bretttold me the sandwich
was actually madeout of the guts of

25:00.790 --> 25:03.640
some guy named joewho's really sloppy.

25:03.650 --> 25:05.380
But I don't believe that.
Do you believe that, mom?

25:05.390 --> 25:07.690
Both:I really need to speak with you.

25:07.700 --> 25:08.730
Allison: You first.

25:08.740 --> 25:09.910
No, you first.

25:09.920 --> 25:12.970
It turns out thatjohn
edgemont is not guilty.

25:12.980 --> 25:15.440
Not? Excellent.You sure?

25:15.450 --> 25:17.220
Did you discover thisbefore
you gave back the money?

25:17.230 --> 25:18.330
Answer the secondquestion first.

25:18.340 --> 25:20.570
Okay, I told you I was
notgiving the money back.

25:20.580 --> 25:21.830
I told you I was not quitting.

25:21.840 --> 25:23.420
Okay, calm down.

25:23.430 --> 25:27.300
Boy, you seem awfully upsetfor somebody
who just eight hours agowas worried

25:27.310 --> 25:32.590
they might be toilingaway for
someone who committeda horrible crime.

25:32.600 --> 25:34.170
He's covering for his daughter.

25:34.180 --> 25:35.870
His daughter killed his wife?

25:35.880 --> 25:36.940
There's somethingwrong with her.

25:36.950 --> 25:38.630
She's got braindamage of some sort.

25:38.640 --> 25:41.690
I only saw her once, briefly.

25:42.380 --> 25:43.390
She seemed sweet.

25:43.400 --> 25:46.310
Apparently, she's gota real a temper.

25:46.320 --> 25:47.500
What are you going to do?

25:47.510 --> 25:50.310
The district attorney
ispushing for the death penalty.

25:50.320 --> 25:51.580
I feel like I haveto tell somebody.

25:51.590 --> 25:53.850
Maybe watt, maybethe district attorney.

25:53.860 --> 25:57.280
And then I think, "no, I can't do
that. This man is choosingto do this."

25:57.290 --> 25:59.390
He's not being framed.
He's not being coerced.

25:59.400 --> 26:03.190
This is a father tryingto
protect his daughter.

26:04.170 --> 26:05.570
Now, what was your thing?

26:05.580 --> 26:06.920
Oh, no, that's not fair.

26:06.930 --> 26:09.090
I can't possiblyfollow your dilemma.

26:09.100 --> 26:10.180
What are you talking about?

26:10.190 --> 26:12.960
You've got this, like, seven course
meal of a moral quandary going on, 

26:12.970 --> 26:14.770
I've got this little fast
food burger of a problem.

26:14.780 --> 26:16.950
- It's okay, it'll wait.
- Joe.

26:18.010 --> 26:21.610
I know how arielis getting her money.

26:22.220 --> 26:23.980
I thought we alreadyhad
this conversation.

26:23.990 --> 26:27.890
Yes, we did, but then I took herto school yesterday
and she's hanging aroundwith these older kids.

26:27.900 --> 26:30.210
You know, and your imaginationjust
starts to go crazy.

26:30.220 --> 26:33.300
Then I realized I just hadto be forthright
about it. I mean, I had to do something.

26:33.310 --> 26:34.870
What are you talkingabout
"do something"?

26:34.880 --> 26:36.530
I don't know, just grab
the bull by the horns.

26:36.540 --> 26:40.510
Anyway, I saw the older girlthat
ariel was talking to the other day, 

26:40.520 --> 26:41.980
and then I justfigured, "what the hell?"

26:41.990 --> 26:43.350
And then you...

26:43.360 --> 26:46.200
Nothing. I didn't do anything.

26:46.900 --> 26:48.960
Hey, you should seethe look on your face.

26:48.970 --> 26:50.220
Well, you must havedone something.

26:50.230 --> 26:53.010
Nothing. I give you my word.

26:53.020 --> 26:54.070
I didn't do anything.

26:54.080 --> 26:55.780
I just went up, I
startedtalking to this girl.

26:55.790 --> 26:56.670
Oh, no.

26:56.680 --> 26:59.830
Oh, yes, how else do you think that I could
figure out howariel was getting her money?

26:59.840 --> 27:01.450
You can't do that.

27:01.460 --> 27:04.090
You can't go behind herback
and talk to her friends.

27:04.100 --> 27:05.920
It wasn't behind her back.

27:05.930 --> 27:08.440
It was in broad daylight in
front of a wholebunch of people.

27:08.450 --> 27:10.060
She just didn't happento be one of them.

27:10.070 --> 27:10.980
This is terrible.

27:10.990 --> 27:12.090
You haven't even heard...

27:12.100 --> 27:14.060
okay, fine. Tell me.

27:14.070 --> 27:16.860
She's doing readings.

27:17.180 --> 27:18.950
Just this one girl, far as I can tell.

27:18.960 --> 27:21.490
And she seemed pretty impressedwith
whatever ariel was telling her, 

27:21.500 --> 27:25.340
which isprobably a pretty good thing
considering she charged her $50.

27:26.320 --> 27:28.470
I guess with all the attentionthat
you got in the press last year, 

27:28.480 --> 27:31.240
it's just a matter of time
before somebody sought her out.

27:31.250 --> 27:32.510
I can't deal withthis right now.

27:32.520 --> 27:34.710
You don't haveto deal
with it. I'll deal with it.

27:34.720 --> 27:36.600
Well, you definitelycan't deal with it.

27:36.610 --> 27:38.820
The minute that she finds out
how you got this information, 

27:38.830 --> 27:41.130
everything you say is
justgoing to fall on deaf ears.

27:41.140 --> 27:42.660
Oh, yeah? How is it thatyou
know this and I don'T.

27:42.670 --> 27:44.120
Well, I don't know, joe.

27:44.130 --> 27:46.610
How is it I knowthis and you don't?

27:47.890 --> 27:49.350
hello?

27:49.360 --> 27:50.590
You know, I don't get that.

27:50.600 --> 27:52.130
Excuse me?

27:52.140 --> 27:53.850
I don't get that either.

27:53.860 --> 27:57.080
You can't tellwho's on the phone, you
leave your bag behindafter a meeting, 

27:57.090 --> 27:59.910
and you call yourselfa big time psychic?

27:59.920 --> 28:01.310
Mr. Watt.

28:01.320 --> 28:03.710
Ooh, maybe I spoke too soon.

28:03.720 --> 28:05.570
So what do you want
me to do with this bag?

28:05.580 --> 28:07.440
There's not much here, just
a pad and some pens.

28:07.450 --> 28:09.420
You want me to hold
onto it until tomorrow?

28:09.430 --> 28:10.640
Where are you?

28:10.650 --> 28:14.670
I'm at the coffee shop across
the street from where we were, why?

28:20.680 --> 28:22.690
Thanks for waiting.

28:26.950 --> 28:28.890
So what is it?

28:28.900 --> 28:30.290
What is what?

28:32.260 --> 28:34.290
you didn't come all the way hereto
get back a pad and some pens.

28:34.300 --> 28:36.940
You're dyingto tell me something.

28:36.950 --> 28:39.080
Just remember our agreement.
I don't wantto know if it has...

28:39.090 --> 28:41.050
no, it's not that.

28:41.060 --> 28:42.880
On the contrary.

28:42.890 --> 28:45.840
Now, I'm certainhe didn't do it.

28:48.920 --> 28:50.750
So ask me who diD.

28:50.760 --> 28:53.030
Do I care?

28:53.040 --> 28:54.450
It's chloe.

28:54.460 --> 28:56.100
His youngest.

28:56.110 --> 28:58.560
And edgemont knows.

29:00.700 --> 29:03.110
Well, that's not
thereaction I was expecting.

29:03.120 --> 29:05.290
What do you mean?

29:05.300 --> 29:07.990
Why am I not surprised?

29:12.050 --> 29:18.810
About six years ago I got a callfrom edgemont's civil
attorneys that my office neededto write up a, uh...

29:18.820 --> 29:21.500
umhea waiver of liability.

29:21.800 --> 29:26.930
A live-in nurse that johnand his first wife
employed attacked in her bedr he middle of the night.

29:26.940 --> 29:30.960
Sound asleep, someone starts beating
the crap out ofher with a baseball bat.

29:30.970 --> 29:34.160
Couple of broken
ribs, contusions tface...

29:34.170 --> 29:37.870
a hundred thousand dollarsand
that waiver later...

29:38.600 --> 29:41.220
hethe problem just... disappeared.

29:41.230 --> 29:43.060
Chloe?

29:43.230 --> 29:44.930
So what do we do now?

29:44.940 --> 29:46.380
What do you mean?

29:46.390 --> 29:48.550
This doesn't change anything.

29:48.560 --> 29:50.530
Our client is still innocent.

29:50.540 --> 29:52.410
And we have to continueto defend him.

29:52.420 --> 29:55.740
But isn't the bestway to defend him, to
prove to the courtwho really did it?

29:55.750 --> 29:58.980
Well, that's one strategy.

29:58.990 --> 30:04.610
But I'm fairly certainit's a strategy
to which our clientswould take exception.

30:05.630 --> 30:07.540
Listen, let'S...

30:07.550 --> 30:08.530
let's get out of here, you know?

30:08.540 --> 30:11.430
We have to finishpicking
a jury tomorrow.

30:11.440 --> 30:12.950
I can't do that.

30:12.960 --> 30:14.070
Can't do what?

30:14.080 --> 30:16.840
I can't be a party to this.

30:16.850 --> 30:20.030
Look, I know you think
whathe's doing is honorable, 

30:20.040 --> 30:23.030
but she is obviously
dangerous.She needs help.

30:23.040 --> 30:27.720
And she's not going to getit as long as everyone
is convinced that herfather is the guilty party.

30:27.730 --> 30:29.580
We have to tell someone.

30:29.590 --> 30:31.840
Tell them what?

30:32.840 --> 30:34.400
I mean no disrespect.

30:34.410 --> 30:35.960
Where did you get this?

30:35.980 --> 30:38.950
A fortune cookie? Burning bush?

30:39.180 --> 30:42.220
I'm not the D.A.I'm a gun for hire.

30:42.230 --> 30:44.760
And john edgemont didn't hire
meto turn his daughter in.

30:44.770 --> 30:49.400
Yeah, well, I'm a gunfor hire, too, and
I didn't sign on for this.

30:49.410 --> 30:52.020
Look, don't be foolish.

30:52.030 --> 30:55.210
The guy is payingyou good
money. And he is innocent.

30:55.220 --> 31:00.420
This is as close as you getto a straight
flush in the defense attorneybusiness.

31:00.430 --> 31:02.520
Listen, I don't want tohave
to go back to my client

31:02.530 --> 31:07.470
and explain to him why one dayyou're
on the team and the next day you're off.

31:07.480 --> 31:10.120
Please, let's just get
through this trial.

31:10.130 --> 31:11.940
And then after our
clientis declared innocent, 

31:11.950 --> 31:15.370
you want to be a girl scoutand go tell
someone about his daughter, go ahead.

31:15.380 --> 31:19.960
But for now, take his
moneyand pay your bills.

31:20.320 --> 31:22.470
Go buy yourself something.

31:22.480 --> 31:23.480
Buy your kids something.

31:23.490 --> 31:26.010
I mean, isn't that
reallywhat this is all about?

31:26.020 --> 31:26.960
Taking care of your kids?

31:26.970 --> 31:28.390
'Cause that's allI'm trying to do.

31:28.400 --> 31:30.820
And that's all you'retrying to do.

31:30.830 --> 31:33.670
Hell, that's allhe's trying to do.

31:51.670 --> 31:54.120
You smelllike shampoo.

32:01.550 --> 32:03.540
I'm sorry.

32:13.070 --> 32:15.950
Thank you forfeeding
everybody and bathingeverybody.

32:15.960 --> 32:17.690
They're my kids, too, you know.

32:17.700 --> 32:19.840
Well, I know that.

32:21.180 --> 32:22.960
did you talk to ariel?

32:22.970 --> 32:25.150
You asked me not to.

32:25.350 --> 32:27.140
Do you have any ideawhat
you're going to say to her?

32:27.150 --> 32:30.220
Well, actually, larrywatt gave me an idea.

32:30.230 --> 32:33.120
And it's $50. Take it.

32:33.130 --> 32:35.030
What's it for?

32:36.870 --> 32:38.820
it's for yourfriend, marcy.

32:38.830 --> 32:42.150
I want you to give herher money back.

32:42.160 --> 32:44.360
Daddy told you?

32:48.460 --> 32:49.580
But I don't get it.

32:49.590 --> 32:51.560
Why are you giving this to me?

32:51.570 --> 32:53.950
Because I can.

32:54.730 --> 32:59.110
Because I want you to putthat
genie back in the bottle.

32:59.480 --> 33:05.540
Because idon't want you going through high schoolwith
everyone remembering you for things that, frankly, 

33:05.550 --> 33:11.300
if I was given a choice, I'm
not sureI would wish on you.

33:12.260 --> 33:15.180
There is so much moreto you than that.

33:15.190 --> 33:18.550
I can't bear the thoughtof
you taking a math test, 

33:18.570 --> 33:22.740
and everyone thinking thatyou
had an unfair advantage.

33:22.750 --> 33:26.020
Or some boy wanting toask you out, 

33:26.030 --> 33:30.710
but hesitating because he's
surethat you already know.

33:30.720 --> 33:35.680
And for people clamoringfor your
attention for all the wrong reasons.

33:35.690 --> 33:38.450
Not because theywant to know you, 

33:38.800 --> 33:42.750
but because they want to
knowwhat they think you know.

33:44.360 --> 33:46.880
Can I tell you a secret?

33:47.980 --> 33:50.510
It wasn't even my idea.

33:50.520 --> 33:55.190
She came up to me at schooland
started asking about you.

33:55.200 --> 33:58.170
Said she'd pay anythingto
know her future.

33:58.180 --> 34:01.010
What college she'dend up going to.

34:01.020 --> 34:05.380
What the name of the manshe
was going to marry would be.

34:05.680 --> 34:09.420
And I wantedthat makeup case so bad.

34:09.429 --> 34:12.440
I just started writingdown
anything that...

34:12.449 --> 34:16.600
came to my mind, and
then I told it to her.

34:18.190 --> 34:22.360
I have no ideaif I'm
right about any of it.

34:22.679 --> 34:25.810
Neither will she. Not for years.

34:26.110 --> 34:27.710
Oh, my girl.

34:27.719 --> 34:31.469
Trust me. Trust me.

34:32.150 --> 34:35.350
You have to givethat money back.

34:35.540 --> 34:40.510
It might hurt alittle bit at
first, but then, after that...

34:40.860 --> 34:43.790
mommy, what's this?

34:53.090 --> 34:55.739
Oh, I completely forgot about this.

34:56.060 --> 34:58.520
Oh, I think it's supposedto
be some kind of fairy.

34:58.530 --> 35:01.390
But I don't know what
itmeans or why I drew it.

35:01.400 --> 35:03.680
Is it a magic fairy?

35:05.090 --> 35:07.810
You know, I don't knowwhat
kind of fairy she is.

35:07.820 --> 35:12.870
Oh, wait, wait. Oh, she's
a sleepy-time fairy.

35:12.880 --> 35:16.680
And she's saying
thatall the little girls

35:16.690 --> 35:21.500
who sneak around and go through their
mama'sthings have to go to bed now.

35:28.430 --> 35:31.820
I heard voices, fighting.

35:31.830 --> 35:34.360
Sweetie, whatare you doing
awake? You should be asleep.

35:34.370 --> 35:37.900
This is stacey's room.
She doesn't likeus in here.

35:38.480 --> 35:41.280
Don't worry, sweetie.

35:45.610 --> 35:47.270
Stacey's gone.

35:47.280 --> 35:48.940
- Gone?
- Yes.

35:48.950 --> 35:51.190
Gone forever.

35:51.200 --> 35:53.810
Can you keep a secret?

35:54.550 --> 35:57.190
Stacey wanted to send you away.

35:57.200 --> 35:59.350
To a hospital.

35:59.360 --> 36:02.100
She wanted us both to leave.

36:02.110 --> 36:05.270
She wanted daddy all to herself.

36:05.280 --> 36:07.050
Don't want to go to hospital.

36:07.060 --> 36:08.550
Oh, sweetie, I know that.

36:08.560 --> 36:11.240
I know that, and you knowI
could never let that happen.

36:11.250 --> 36:16.350
I wouldn't let hersend you away, so
I made her leave to protect you.

36:16.680 --> 36:18.930
But then I startedto get scared.

36:18.940 --> 36:21.800
I got scaredthat daddy might be upset.

36:21.810 --> 36:25.490
What if daddy got mad at
mebecause stacey had left?

36:25.500 --> 36:27.740
Daddy loves stacey.

36:27.750 --> 36:30.140
Daddy loves stacey.

36:30.150 --> 36:32.540
And daddy loves chloe.

36:32.550 --> 36:38.360
In fact, he never getsmad at
chloe, so I told him you did it.

36:38.370 --> 36:40.430
- Me?
- YeS.

36:40.440 --> 36:44.700
Just like that other timewith the bad
nurse who kept telling on you and me?

36:44.710 --> 36:47.750
Remember we told daddythat you hit her?

36:48.540 --> 36:51.100
This is justlike that.

36:51.110 --> 36:54.560
And now everything's goingto be fine.

36:55.740 --> 36:58.950
You can keep my secret
for me, can't you, baby?

36:58.960 --> 37:01.610
And you'll never telldaddy the truth?

37:01.620 --> 37:03.450
Even if he asks?

37:03.460 --> 37:05.450
No, I won'T.

37:05.460 --> 37:07.370
He'll be so mad at me.

37:07.380 --> 37:11.000
I won't tell, I won't!

37:15.790 --> 37:18.830
Oh, I love you so much.

37:22.280 --> 37:25.120
I used the fairy.

37:27.360 --> 37:29.230
Do you want to touch it?

37:29.240 --> 37:32.270
Feel what itfelt like?

37:32.980 --> 37:35.080
Go on.

37:36.620 --> 37:38.980
Put yourhands on it.

37:38.990 --> 37:41.350
You're not goingto hurt anything.

37:48.100 --> 37:49.710
Wait.

37:51.970 --> 37:54.420
I have to call larry watt.

37:54.880 --> 37:56.660
Oh, it's going rightto voicemail.

37:56.670 --> 37:58.650
Oh, it's-it's barely 7:00.

37:58.660 --> 38:01.160
His cell phoneprobably
isn't even on yet.

38:02.360 --> 38:04.330
he's still not picking up.

38:04.340 --> 38:07.180
Hey, mom, can we havesloppy
joes for breakfast some time?

38:07.190 --> 38:08.370
Sure, babe.

38:08.380 --> 38:10.600
Joe: Allison, putthe phone down.

38:10.610 --> 38:13.330
The man obviouslyisn't at work yet.

38:13.340 --> 38:14.940
No. I'll feed the kids.

38:14.950 --> 38:16.620
You go get ready for court.

38:16.630 --> 38:20.280
Woman : This was the scene just before
dawn at the mariposa county courthouse, 

38:20.290 --> 38:25.280
where accused killer john edgemont confessed
and surrendered to the district attorney

38:25.290 --> 38:27.680
in the bludgeoning
death of his wife, stacey.

38:27.690 --> 38:29.540
- Edgemont pled guilty to second degree ...
- Oh, my god.

38:29.550 --> 38:31.180
- Tell mommyyou want sloppy joes.
- ...manslaughter with conspiracy after the fact.

38:31.190 --> 38:32.300
Kids, shh!

38:32.310 --> 38:35.180
Edgemont, in a sudden, early
morning confession, 

38:35.190 --> 38:39.510
admitted that he struck his wife with
a small sculpture during an argument, 

38:39.520 --> 38:44.400
then attempted to mislead authorities by
staging a car accident to cover up the crime.

38:44.440 --> 38:48.400
Even as we speak, the judge in the case is meeting with
the attorneys from both sides to determine sentencing...

38:48.410 --> 38:50.370
this is terrible. He thinks it's chloe.

38:50.380 --> 38:52.490
He thinks he's protectingsomeone
who needs protecting.

38:52.500 --> 38:54.340
I have to get down there.

38:54.410 --> 38:57.830
Watt: The other thing toremember
here is, it's not overtill it's over...

39:03.860 --> 39:05.110
I'll tell you, mrs. Dubois.

39:05.120 --> 39:10.190
This arriving after everything has happened isnot
a good thing for your reputationas a psychic.

39:10.200 --> 39:11.190
I woke up.

39:11.200 --> 39:14.590
I saw it... on the television.

39:14.600 --> 39:16.070
Why?

39:16.360 --> 39:17.640
I got a call at3:00 in the morning.

39:17.650 --> 39:20.690
He wanted to confess, wanted
to turn himself in.

39:20.700 --> 39:22.080
There was nochanging his mind.

39:22.090 --> 39:24.790
There was no talkingto him about it.

39:25.090 --> 39:28.700
No one's more shockedby
all this than I am.

39:30.310 --> 39:35.080
Well, I'm going to head
home andgrab a shower.

39:35.610 --> 39:37.660
If you needanything.

39:37.670 --> 39:39.160
I'm fine.

39:41.710 --> 39:43.820
Mrs. Dubois.

39:47.150 --> 39:51.720
I know my father wouldwant me to thank
you for all that you didon his behalf.

39:51.730 --> 39:53.360
I know he didn't do it.

39:53.370 --> 39:55.500
Mr. Watt told me.

39:56.090 --> 39:58.170
Oh, he loves my sister.

39:58.630 --> 40:01.250
Maybe too much.

40:01.260 --> 40:04.640
Why 3:00 in the morning?
Why the sudden urgency?

40:05.000 --> 40:06.310
I don't know.

40:06.320 --> 40:08.300
I mentioned to himabout your drawing.

40:08.310 --> 40:10.170
The fairy?

40:10.180 --> 40:13.810
I saw whenit came to you
in thatlawyer's office.

40:14.020 --> 40:19.850
I think he was concerned that it was only a
matterof time before someone found the statue, 

40:19.860 --> 40:22.040
tied my sister to the crime.

40:22.050 --> 40:24.390
Your sister, right.

40:25.250 --> 40:28.400
so what happens to
her nowafter all this?

40:28.410 --> 40:32.550
Doesn't she just end upin a
hospital or an institution anyway?

40:32.560 --> 40:33.820
Absolutely not.

40:33.830 --> 40:37.840
She'll be with mein the house we
grew up in, just like daddy wants.

40:37.850 --> 40:41.970
Until you get mad at her, or you
don't need herfor an alibi anymore.

40:41.980 --> 40:45.840
Or you just get tiredof
watching over her.

40:47.790 --> 40:53.040
Once again, my whole family appreciates
all that you've done for us.

40:55.380 --> 40:57.990
Have a nice day, mrs. Dubois.

40:59.220 --> 41:01.140
I'll be watching you.

41:04.620 --> 41:06.580
