WEBVTT

02:39.160 --> 02:40.244
Do you believe in God?

02:43.831 --> 02:47.668
No, but I enjoy the tranquility here

03:10.482 --> 03:11.609
Want to check the gun?

03:15.279 --> 03:16.363
I trust you

06:37.564 --> 06:38.482
Don't move

07:49.803 --> 07:50.888
I can't see

07:51.096 --> 07:52.347
Your corneas have been badly damaged

07:52.473 --> 07:53.223
Will I recover?

07:53.307 --> 07:54.892
There is hope, but your sight

07:54.892 --> 07:55.726
will never be perfect

07:55.726 --> 07:56.477
My sight is so blurred

07:56.477 --> 07:58.937
We can do an operation, a transplant

07:59.271 --> 08:00.397
Will I be blind?

08:01.273 --> 08:03.650
Jennie, I'm Sergeant Chang

08:03.901 --> 08:06.487
Do you remember the murderer's face?

08:12.576 --> 08:15.204
Please leave me alone, I'm so afraid

08:15.329 --> 08:16.622
Calm down

09:12.469 --> 09:16.098
Help! Help!

09:22.312 --> 09:24.439
Please help!

09:24.690 --> 09:25.357
Bastards!

09:51.216 --> 09:52.259
Just go away,

09:52.593 --> 09:55.095
They have gone already, don't be afraid

09:56.263 --> 09:57.306
I'll take you home

10:02.394 --> 10:03.270
Jennie!

10:04.479 --> 10:05.689
How do you know my name?

10:07.482 --> 10:08.692
I listen to you singing every night

10:10.819 --> 10:11.737
Who are you?

10:13.030 --> 10:17.659
I feel as if I know you

10:18.952 --> 10:20.120
I know you can't see too well

10:20.454 --> 10:21.246
I've wanted to help,

10:21.997 --> 10:23.165
but I didn't have the chance

10:26.209 --> 10:27.336
In this world

10:28.420 --> 10:29.838
not everybody is untrustworthy

10:31.173 --> 10:32.591
Will you let me help you this time?

10:57.282 --> 10:59.076
Is it alright for me to leave?

11:06.500 --> 11:10.253
Keep calm, let me check it out

11:15.676 --> 11:16.593
It's only a cat

11:16.677 --> 11:19.346
It often sneaks in and scratches my furniture

11:19.471 --> 11:20.514
Such a nuisance!

11:46.707 --> 11:47.749
Why did you turn off the light?

11:47.916 --> 11:49.126
You can see?

11:51.586 --> 11:52.671
I only see shadows

11:53.088 --> 11:54.297
Last month it was better

11:54.715 --> 11:56.508
I could see images

11:57.050 --> 11:59.886
Turn on the light it makes me feel safer

12:12.065 --> 12:13.024
What are you doing now?

12:13.608 --> 12:15.026
I'm looking at this scarf

12:22.617 --> 12:24.035
It's got my blood

12:24.244 --> 12:25.454
stains on it

12:25.996 --> 12:29.750
The man who shot me wrapped it round my eyes

12:31.585 --> 12:33.253
I will never forget

12:33.879 --> 12:35.338
Would you like some tea?

12:38.091 --> 12:38.592
No thanks

12:38.842 --> 12:41.052
It won't take a minute. Sit down please

12:41.470 --> 12:42.888
I'll put some music on

13:37.651 --> 13:39.528
Hey relax, you look exactly like

13:39.611 --> 13:41.530
what you are an undercover agent

13:42.155 --> 13:44.866
Lighten up or it'll be an open secret

13:46.910 --> 13:47.577
Come on

13:48.662 --> 13:49.830
Smile!

13:55.043 --> 13:57.587
Now you look like something out of a nut house

14:02.801 --> 14:06.555
Chang, this guy Eddy's a lunatic. Be careful

14:06.721 --> 14:08.890
Same to you pal,

14:09.015 --> 14:10.392
watch your ass!

14:22.362 --> 14:25.448
Eddy, sorry to keep you waiting

14:25.615 --> 14:26.533
Who the hell's that?

14:26.616 --> 14:28.910
He's a good buddy. Say hello to Eddy

14:29.619 --> 14:30.412
Eddy

14:30.954 --> 14:31.913
Search him!

14:35.000 --> 14:37.168
Eddy, what's with the security?

14:37.168 --> 14:38.920
It's not our first deal

14:43.300 --> 14:44.718
Maybe I've seen him before

14:47.804 --> 14:51.683
$200,000 We'll check the guns first

15:32.474 --> 15:33.308
What are you guys doing?

15:33.391 --> 15:36.227
Nothing special, officer. A reunion

15:36.728 --> 15:37.938
Open the trunk

15:38.229 --> 15:41.232
Open it!

15:41.775 --> 15:42.817
Now!

15:46.488 --> 15:48.239
Damn you! You set me up, didn't you?

15:48.657 --> 15:49.866
Are you a cop?

15:50.909 --> 15:51.868
Talk!

15:54.496 --> 16:00.001
I'm no cop! I didn't betray you

16:00.251 --> 16:02.420
If you ain't, how come he's here?

16:02.420 --> 16:04.881
He's not! I stake my life on it Eddy!

16:04.881 --> 16:06.341
He's not a cop!

16:07.217 --> 16:08.468
Lying bastard, I shouldn't have trusted you!

16:08.551 --> 16:10.845
- The guy's a cop, I recognise him!
- You've got it wrong

16:23.942 --> 16:26.027
Chang, I'll get him

16:36.246 --> 16:37.747
That shithead!

16:38.581 --> 16:39.499
Shit

17:46.274 --> 17:47.192
Keep back

17:55.825 --> 17:56.826
Don't move!

18:07.337 --> 18:09.506
Goddamn! Ass Assho

18:09.589 --> 18:10.590
Finish your sentence

18:10.590 --> 18:12.550
Assassh

18:19.099 --> 18:22.018
Inspector Li, the suspect Eddy Wong held a hostage

18:22.227 --> 18:23.895
in a crowded tram

18:24.187 --> 18:26.439
Could you see him clearly?

18:26.606 --> 18:27.190
Could you?

18:27.398 --> 18:28.024
Yes

18:28.108 --> 18:28.983
Why did you shoot?

18:29.109 --> 18:29.692
By instinct

18:30.068 --> 18:31.945
Did you consider the safety of the passengers?

18:32.320 --> 18:34.280
Did you sound any warning before you shot?

18:34.781 --> 18:35.532
There was no time for that

18:35.698 --> 18:37.492
The hostage had a coronary thrombosis

18:37.826 --> 18:40.328
She died of a heart attack

18:40.662 --> 18:42.038
Her family have made an official complaint

18:42.580 --> 18:43.998
You're responsible for her death

18:44.541 --> 18:47.168
That's crazy, how could I know
she had a heart condition?

18:48.044 --> 18:49.879
I've been on Eddy Hung's case for seven months

18:50.505 --> 18:52.298
The guy was a maniac

18:52.382 --> 18:53.591
He'd shoot anybody for any reason

18:54.509 --> 18:56.719
Should I have waited till he killed her?

18:57.595 --> 19:00.932
You forget I'd just seen him kill a cop

19:01.850 --> 19:03.560
Who's responsible for that cop's death?

19:09.816 --> 19:12.443
Fine! Do whatever you want

19:13.236 --> 19:15.697
I'm used to all sorts of complaints

19:16.614 --> 19:17.991
One more doesn't make any difference

19:37.302 --> 19:38.136
Catch it!

19:47.896 --> 19:48.938
How is the action hand?

19:49.898 --> 19:50.815
Pretty useless

19:55.361 --> 19:56.571
Better use it more

19:57.405 --> 19:58.448
It won't help

19:59.699 --> 20:03.036
A one handed killer's out of the action

20:05.496 --> 20:07.916
I've had my day

20:15.757 --> 20:16.799
His name is Tong Weng

20:17.592 --> 20:19.552
He works with a drug ring in Central America

20:20.428 --> 20:21.262
Who wants him dead?

20:21.554 --> 20:24.057
No questions. Take it or leave it?

20:27.936 --> 20:28.937
1.5 million

20:30.230 --> 20:31.147
Seems high

20:32.941 --> 20:34.734
This is my last hatchet job

20:35.902 --> 20:38.238
Alright it's a deal

20:38.571 --> 20:39.656
Money's no object

20:45.787 --> 20:48.539
These guns are clean. No serial numbers

20:49.332 --> 20:50.541
Untraceable

20:51.209 --> 20:53.253
Explosive head bullets, your favourite

21:15.984 --> 21:17.777
It's easy to pick it up, hard to put it down

21:20.530 --> 21:21.698
Want to change your mind?

21:43.845 --> 21:44.846
Why take this job?

21:48.766 --> 21:51.227
This one's for Jennie

21:51.728 --> 21:54.063
If you doesn't have a cornea transplant soon

21:54.480 --> 21:56.482
She might lose her sight forever

21:57.191 --> 21:58.526
There is a cornea bank in Hong Kong

21:58.985 --> 22:00.862
But it's always empty

22:01.154 --> 22:03.114
When a donation does come in

22:03.406 --> 22:05.575
Someone else gets it first

22:06.284 --> 22:07.785
So we're going to try abroad

22:33.978 --> 22:37.023
I have to leave you for a few days

22:38.232 --> 22:39.901
On my return, I'll take you overseas for surgery

22:42.945 --> 22:44.238
You will come back

22:46.699 --> 22:47.617
I promise

23:02.298 --> 23:03.216
Thanks!

23:04.592 --> 23:05.843
Today is the Dragon Boat Festival

23:05.927 --> 23:09.097
Many VIPs and government officials

23:09.097 --> 23:10.556
will attend the opening ceremony

23:10.932 --> 23:12.809
You are assigned to protect them

23:12.892 --> 23:14.685
Their information is in your files

23:15.269 --> 23:16.979
Make sure you do a professional job

23:16.979 --> 23:18.022
Yes sir!

23:18.272 --> 23:22.735
Tony Weng, protecting that scum

23:53.933 --> 23:57.145
Attention please! Will all competitors please

23:57.562 --> 24:00.857
assemble before the floating platform
for the dotting the dragon's eye ceremony

24:01.107 --> 24:02.817
It is our pleasure to welcome the president of

24:02.817 --> 24:05.611
Tung Yuan Financial Corp, Mr Weng

24:08.406 --> 24:11.492
The chairman of Rotary Club, Mr Peter Chu

24:46.611 --> 24:48.696
Mr Weng

24:49.697 --> 24:51.199
Faster

24:51.199 --> 24:52.783
Good luck

25:30.613 --> 25:32.198
Mr Weng, please

26:57.700 --> 26:59.118
Cover him up, keep everything under control

26:59.368 --> 26:59.994
Red alert, red alert!

26:59.994 --> 27:02.663
Tony Weng's been shot on the floating platform

27:09.503 --> 27:10.796
The shot came from around the fishing junks

27:10.796 --> 27:11.881
The murderer must still be nearby

27:13.799 --> 27:16.469
All units prepare to seal off the area

27:20.848 --> 27:21.641
Mr Weng fainted.

27:21.641 --> 27:23.100
Everything's alright

27:23.100 --> 27:24.602
Please enjoy your day

29:16.964 --> 29:18.507
Chang!

31:27.845 --> 31:30.222
Chang, look over there! An explosion

31:30.472 --> 31:31.807
Right, let's check it out!

31:49.825 --> 31:51.535
Chang, we can't lose him now!

32:32.409 --> 32:33.285
Freeze!

33:16.370 --> 33:17.496
Don't be afraid

33:22.668 --> 33:24.086
You'll be alright

33:26.130 --> 33:26.922
Don't cry

33:34.054 --> 33:35.389
He's down there Step on it!

33:35.389 --> 33:36.390
Ok!

33:43.981 --> 33:45.941
Any hospital's nearby?

33:46.775 --> 33:47.985
Think he's got a conscience?

33:47.985 --> 33:49.570
He won't let the little girl die

34:08.047 --> 34:09.922
Nurse, where's casualty?

34:09.922 --> 34:11.592
This way

34:16.179 --> 34:17.139
What happened?

34:18.014 --> 34:18.806
She got shot

34:18.806 --> 34:19.975
Quickly! Put her down

34:20.059 --> 34:21.060
Nurse, check her blood pressure

34:21.143 --> 34:22.143
Prepare her for surgery

34:22.643 --> 34:26.065
Oxygen mask

34:33.697 --> 34:34.489
How is she?

34:34.572 --> 34:35.699
Blood pressure unstable

34:35.824 --> 34:36.699
Weak pulse

34:36.784 --> 34:37.951
Blood pressure low

34:42.414 --> 34:43.791
Have you seen a man carrying a wounded child?

34:43.791 --> 34:44.458
He went to casualty

34:44.541 --> 34:45.542
Detain anyone suspicious

34:45.626 --> 34:46.001
Yes sir!

34:46.085 --> 34:47.835
Are you related to the patient?

34:47.835 --> 34:48.920
How was she wounded?

34:49.545 --> 34:50.839
Sir, you can't leave now

34:52.132 --> 34:54.426
I have to register your name

34:55.511 --> 34:56.469
Where is he?

35:09.274 --> 35:10.734
I'm an Inspector, just carry on

35:10.734 --> 35:12.569
Right, nurses, ignore them

35:12.569 --> 35:13.695
Yes

35:23.747 --> 35:24.873
Don't mind them, save the girl

35:24.957 --> 35:25.833
Yes

35:27.167 --> 35:28.335
Don't disturb the doctor

35:29.837 --> 35:30.921
Put your guns down

36:17.926 --> 36:18.468
What happened?

36:18.552 --> 36:19.303
There was a gunshot

36:19.386 --> 36:20.888
- Where?
- Over there!

36:23.098 --> 36:24.808
- Get everybody out
- Yes sir!

36:45.746 --> 36:46.663
I'll call HQ

36:48.123 --> 36:49.041
Any progress on Weng's case?

36:49.041 --> 36:50.918
No, none at all

36:52.211 --> 36:53.462
I nearly got the suspect

36:53.462 --> 36:54.588
But he escaped

36:54.671 --> 36:57.049
I thought you had razor sharp intuition?

36:58.675 --> 37:00.469
I'm being made to look a fool

37:00.928 --> 37:03.222
so this case is real important to me

37:04.056 --> 37:05.974
I don't need you letting me down

37:06.683 --> 37:09.019
You always were a pain in the ass

37:10.187 --> 37:11.688
Do me a favour and prove me wrong

37:13.649 --> 37:16.485
Sir, I do nothing for nobody

37:17.611 --> 37:19.196
I'll get the murderer

37:20.197 --> 37:21.573
I won't let you lose face

37:23.200 --> 37:25.661
I hope you don't forget
who helped you reach the top

37:29.623 --> 37:31.250
I want you to draw the suspect

37:31.375 --> 37:32.501
Try, To bring him to life

37:32.960 --> 37:33.835
He's over 30

37:35.087 --> 37:36.421
He looks determined

37:38.215 --> 37:39.258
without being ruthless

37:40.968 --> 37:42.761
Something heroic in his manner

37:47.099 --> 37:49.601
Doesn't look like a killer in any way

37:51.478 --> 37:52.688
Comes across so calm

37:54.898 --> 37:56.024
Acts like he has a dream

37:57.693 --> 37:58.694
Eyes full of passion

38:50.329 --> 38:51.121
Hello

38:51.121 --> 38:51.913
It's me, Jeff

38:52.289 --> 38:53.081
Jeff?

38:53.540 --> 38:54.374
Why haven't you left town?

38:54.541 --> 38:55.709
I want my money now

39:00.339 --> 39:01.423
I want it tonight

39:02.591 --> 39:03.258
Tonight!

39:03.800 --> 39:05.802
Sure, I'll bring it over tonight

39:15.395 --> 39:16.146
Mr Weng!

39:16.980 --> 39:18.732
You should let me handle Jeff,

39:19.191 --> 39:20.400
he's my side of things

39:21.193 --> 39:23.320
- What if he squeals on me?
- He's not that kind of guy

39:24.237 --> 39:26.198
I don't trust anyone

39:26.406 --> 39:27.491
Including you!

39:30.827 --> 39:32.204
I know the rules of the game

39:33.246 --> 39:35.123
I'll do what I promised

39:35.540 --> 39:37.501
I'm not interested in rules, I want him dead

39:38.293 --> 39:40.295
because he exposed his identity

39:41.171 --> 39:42.506
I'm the boss now

39:42.589 --> 39:44.633
and you do things my way

39:46.218 --> 39:47.761
Ok, you kill him for me

39:48.178 --> 39:50.722
If you blow it, you're dead meat

39:53.600 --> 39:55.018
After all, you got paid for it

40:16.957 --> 40:18.667
Eagle, this could be a lead

40:19.126 --> 40:22.629
Six months ago, Weng's partner, Lim

40:22.796 --> 40:23.922
was cut down by a professional hitman

40:24.297 --> 40:25.173
The killer

40:25.173 --> 40:27.217
was never caught

40:27.759 --> 40:29.344
but he accidentally blinded a singer

40:30.303 --> 40:31.221
What was her name?

40:32.806 --> 40:33.557
Jennie!

40:34.808 --> 40:36.601
She hasn't recovered yet

40:39.104 --> 40:43.984
Life's cheap, it only takes one bullet

40:47.195 --> 40:49.197
He's no ordinary assassin

40:50.824 --> 40:52.159
I hope we're just looking for one man

40:53.785 --> 40:54.870
If I'm not mistaken

40:56.121 --> 40:57.456
This man is not a cold-blooded murderer

40:59.040 --> 40:59.749
It only takes one bullet

40:59.749 --> 41:00.917
cold blooded or not

41:01.793 --> 41:04.921
He risked his life to save the little girl

41:07.340 --> 41:09.509
And if he did hurt the singer by accident

41:13.096 --> 41:14.890
He must have contacted her

41:40.290 --> 41:41.041
Jeff?

41:41.291 --> 41:43.084
I'm not Jeff

41:44.669 --> 41:47.923
I'm sorry, I can't see clearly

41:48.298 --> 41:50.008
I thought you were my friend

41:51.510 --> 41:52.594
This is a beautiful song

41:53.011 --> 41:54.346
Could you sing it again?

41:55.430 --> 41:57.974
I only sing for one person

41:58.058 --> 41:59.059
Jeff?

42:00.685 --> 42:02.270
Your singing is so full of emotion

42:02.938 --> 42:06.149
After listening to it,
I feel like I know your friend already

42:06.399 --> 42:07.984
I wish he was here now

42:15.158 --> 42:19.412
Wherever he may be, you are in his thoughts

42:33.760 --> 42:35.595
But a part of him will always be here

43:30.191 --> 43:31.192
Don't you trust me anymore?

43:32.319 --> 43:33.320
You know why

43:36.489 --> 43:37.324
Of course

43:38.908 --> 43:39.826
People in our profession

43:39.826 --> 43:41.745
are not supposed to trust anyone

43:52.339 --> 43:53.840
How did they know I'd go to that beach?

43:54.507 --> 43:56.217
I might have been followed

43:56.217 --> 43:57.302
when I drove the car there

43:58.261 --> 43:59.346
That's my fault

44:01.806 --> 44:02.891
Who wants me dead?

44:03.683 --> 44:04.643
Why do you ask?

44:07.187 --> 44:09.189
You know the rules

44:11.983 --> 44:13.652
Why didn't you flee, after the job?

44:15.153 --> 44:16.863
I haven't got my money yet

46:25.533 --> 46:26.534
Who wants to kill me?

46:27.494 --> 46:28.787
If you hadn't exposed your identity

46:30.121 --> 46:31.331
he wouldn't want you dead

46:33.666 --> 46:35.752
Answer me, who wants to kill me?

46:41.174 --> 46:44.010
Answer me first, do you have any bullets left?

46:50.308 --> 46:52.352
I always save the last bullet

46:53.561 --> 46:56.314
Either for myself, or my enemy

46:58.566 --> 47:04.447
It's Johnny Weng, Tony Weng's nephew,
he wants you dead

47:04.989 --> 47:06.699
He hired you to kill his uncle

47:41.067 --> 47:42.694
Do you really have one last bullet?

47:55.206 --> 47:59.586
Jeff, thank you for sparing me

48:01.963 --> 48:03.590
We are in the same boat now

48:05.216 --> 48:07.051
There's no way out for us

48:08.720 --> 48:10.346
I never want to see you again

48:16.311 --> 48:17.353
Inspector Li!

48:20.523 --> 48:22.775
Inspector Li, five dead witnesses

48:53.848 --> 48:54.641
It was him

48:55.725 --> 48:56.434
Are you sure?

48:57.060 --> 48:59.687
Show his picture to the neighbors
and ask if he was here

49:00.939 --> 49:01.981
Ok

50:00.039 --> 50:01.833
Inspector Li, you hit it on the nail

50:01.833 --> 50:04.252
The neighbors say he lives here

50:12.135 --> 50:13.302
Are you nuts?

50:46.127 --> 50:46.878
Jennie!

50:47.628 --> 50:49.922
Jeff, it's you?

50:50.298 --> 50:51.549
Why don't you come back?

50:52.425 --> 50:53.634
I'll be back this morning

50:54.635 --> 50:56.345
We're moving to a new home

50:56.637 --> 50:57.472
Why?

50:58.598 --> 51:00.141
I thought you loved

51:00.475 --> 51:01.601
to live by the sea

51:01.934 --> 51:02.935
do

51:04.395 --> 51:05.772
Beautiful sea breezes

51:06.439 --> 51:07.899
I can imagine the view of the deep blue sea

51:08.232 --> 51:10.485
and the clear blue sky

51:11.069 --> 51:13.738
Great, pack your things and wait for me

51:15.073 --> 51:16.115
I'll be here

51:30.630 --> 51:32.882
You didn't leave Hong Kong when you had the chance

51:33.674 --> 51:34.634
What stopped you?

51:50.566 --> 51:52.693
Are you the new janitor?

51:52.777 --> 51:53.194
Yes lady

51:53.194 --> 51:55.613
You're not doing your job properly

51:55.613 --> 51:57.198
This is a fire-escape

51:57.281 --> 51:58.908
Look, there's garbage everywhere

51:58.991 --> 52:01.077
What happens if there's a fire?

52:01.160 --> 52:02.787
I can't fly away like a phoenix

52:03.579 --> 52:05.123
I pay my maintenance fee every month

52:05.123 --> 52:06.457
If I find you lazy again

52:06.999 --> 52:08.543
I'll file a complaint against you

52:08.543 --> 52:09.502
Don't leave...

52:09.502 --> 52:10.962
- any garbage here
- You bet lady

52:10.962 --> 52:12.880
Move it all away

52:13.965 --> 52:15.341
Shit

52:46.914 --> 52:49.041
Jeff, you're back

52:49.625 --> 52:50.793
Yes, Jennie

52:55.006 --> 52:56.299
Are you with a friend?

52:57.925 --> 53:00.803
Yes, he used to play football with me

53:02.680 --> 53:05.099
We grew up in the same squatter area

53:06.809 --> 53:08.769
Yes He's

53:09.228 --> 53:11.189
I'm Dumbo, he's Mickey Mouse

53:12.064 --> 53:13.733
You called each other that?

53:15.985 --> 53:17.236
It's good to see you again

53:17.403 --> 53:18.696
I don't share that feeling

53:19.363 --> 53:20.740
You're not pleased to see your friend?

53:20.948 --> 53:22.408
We're not that close

53:23.409 --> 53:25.912
He's been causing me a lot of trouble

53:25.912 --> 53:27.371
I'm here to sort it out

53:27.788 --> 53:28.414
Have a seat

53:28.414 --> 53:29.498
Let me make you some tea

53:29.498 --> 53:30.416
Don't bother

53:30.958 --> 53:31.959
No need

53:31.959 --> 53:32.919
Please be careful

53:32.919 --> 53:33.669
Take care, Jennie

53:33.669 --> 53:35.379
I know how to do it, I won't hurt myself

53:35.671 --> 53:38.007
Jeff, take care of Dumbo while I make the tea

53:41.219 --> 53:43.221
Dumbo, make yourself at home

53:43.638 --> 53:45.514
I am, Mickey Mouse

53:46.390 --> 53:49.977
Ma'am, why're you so concerned about the garbage?

53:49.977 --> 53:51.562
He paid me 1,000 bucks

53:51.562 --> 53:53.064
to keep you talking

53:53.689 --> 53:54.482
Don't walk out on me now!

53:54.482 --> 53:55.983
I haven't had this much fun

53:56.692 --> 53:58.152
in twenty years!

53:58.444 --> 53:59.528
You're going to lose this game

53:59.612 --> 54:01.447
Am I? Let's wait and see

54:01.948 --> 54:04.700
You're always the loser

54:05.910 --> 54:08.871
Not this time, I'm well prepared

54:10.206 --> 54:11.791
Let's put your preparations to the test

54:15.044 --> 54:16.295
Are you always so determined?

54:16.712 --> 54:19.298
Yes, that's my style

54:19.966 --> 54:20.758
Mine too!

54:21.384 --> 54:23.010
So we have something in common

54:24.095 --> 54:29.725
Is that what you think?

54:29.725 --> 54:30.768
For sure

54:32.478 --> 54:35.439
Have some tea, whilst you catch up on old times

54:36.482 --> 54:38.442
Thanks Jennie,

54:38.442 --> 54:39.819
be careful

54:41.946 --> 54:44.740
Jennie, this is Dumbo's hand

54:45.449 --> 54:46.826
Here's your tea

54:49.412 --> 54:50.788
- Thank you
- Pleasure

54:50.997 --> 54:52.748
Is he another friend of yours?

54:53.541 --> 54:57.545
No, he's the janitor

54:58.546 --> 54:59.588
We don't have a janitor in this building

54:59.672 --> 55:02.800
Oh, he's the plumber

55:03.551 --> 55:05.011
There's a burst water pipe outside

55:05.386 --> 55:07.930
Dumbo, your voice is so familiar

55:07.930 --> 55:09.181
Have we met somewhere before?

55:09.890 --> 55:11.058
I met you in the nightclub

55:12.101 --> 55:13.269
I loved your singing,

55:13.269 --> 55:14.437
but you didn't want to sing without Jeff there

55:14.520 --> 55:16.314
Oh, I remember

55:16.314 --> 55:17.690
What a coincidence!

55:17.982 --> 55:20.609
Dumbo, take care of Jennie for a while

55:20.609 --> 55:21.402
I'm going to the bathroom

55:21.569 --> 55:22.403
Me too

55:22.862 --> 55:25.114
There's another bathroom in the bedroom

55:25.781 --> 55:26.949
Jennie, there's a rat

55:26.949 --> 55:27.950
Rat?

55:27.950 --> 55:29.952
In the kitchen, I'll catch it

56:04.278 --> 56:06.030
Hey, don't shoot! It's me!

56:06.155 --> 56:07.365
Don't shoot!

56:08.741 --> 56:10.368
Somebody down there's aiming at my ass!

56:36.060 --> 56:36.769
Jennie!

56:38.187 --> 56:39.438
What happened?

56:40.731 --> 56:41.565
Where's Jeff?

56:43.567 --> 56:45.152
I know you and Jeff lied to me

56:46.362 --> 56:47.238
Tell me the truth!

56:48.489 --> 56:49.782
Who the hell are you?

56:52.243 --> 56:53.285
I'm a cop

56:55.788 --> 56:56.997
Jeff is a professional killer

56:57.748 --> 56:58.499
He murdered somebody

56:59.208 --> 57:00.626
I've been after him for months

57:02.294 --> 57:03.003
I don't believe you

57:03.504 --> 57:04.296
Jennie!

57:05.339 --> 57:06.424
Listen to me, Jennie

57:06.507 --> 57:07.758
No I won't

57:08.134 --> 57:08.843
Jennie, it's true

57:08.843 --> 57:09.969
Chang!

57:11.345 --> 57:12.721
Jennie, calm down

57:12.805 --> 57:13.806
Listen please!

57:15.599 --> 57:16.600
Sit down

57:21.230 --> 57:22.231
Six months ago

57:23.816 --> 57:26.485
Jeff shot your face up by accident

57:28.070 --> 57:30.197
Now, his employer wants him dead

57:30.990 --> 57:32.116
I don't believe it

57:38.914 --> 57:41.250
I'd like to help but I can't in my position

57:43.794 --> 57:46.839
I hope you'll cooperate with us

57:48.132 --> 57:52.303
Jennie, we're using you as bait

57:52.845 --> 57:54.305
If I can get Jeff in this time

57:55.473 --> 57:57.099
I'll be able to help save his life,

57:59.018 --> 58:00.728
otherwise the guy who hired him will kill him

58:07.485 --> 58:09.487
Name your price, I just want him dead!

58:09.945 --> 58:12.281
He was seen on the job

58:12.281 --> 58:13.949
I want him wasted, the sooner the better

58:14.950 --> 58:16.785
Deposit US$100,000 into my account now

58:17.369 --> 58:19.121
another US$200,000 on completion

58:21.373 --> 58:22.750
No money no action Mr Weng

58:23.209 --> 58:25.085
Not even if I see someone's finger on the trigger,

58:25.586 --> 58:26.504
ready to blow your head off

58:27.296 --> 58:28.756
Get the hundred grand into his account

58:28.756 --> 58:29.924
I could have got him

58:30.132 --> 58:32.551
What do you want?

58:39.183 --> 58:40.226
You should pay Jeff,

58:40.226 --> 58:41.977
or he could be a real danger to you

58:43.771 --> 58:45.314
That's bullshit! I'm safe

58:45.731 --> 58:48.734
Look at these guys, they're killers

58:52.905 --> 58:54.657
You're the boss, you should keep your word

58:54.823 --> 58:55.950
Don't talk crap

58:56.033 --> 58:56.909
I ain't going to pay him,

58:56.909 --> 58:58.118
even if you beg

58:58.118 --> 59:00.037
Mr Weng, let me keep my word,

59:00.037 --> 59:01.705
and pay him what I promised

59:03.499 --> 59:04.959
Then I'll bring him to you

59:09.338 --> 59:12.550
Mr Weng, if it pleases you,

59:13.884 --> 59:15.052
I will beg

59:15.261 --> 59:17.179
Go to hell, you jerk!

59:17.721 --> 59:19.265
If you hadn't worked for my father for so long

59:19.348 --> 59:20.307
I'd have kicked the shit out of you

59:20.808 --> 59:23.477
Who is he? He doesn't deserve your sympathy

59:23.978 --> 59:27.106
Why are you doing all this for Jeff?

59:27.565 --> 59:29.108
He's my best friend

59:29.858 --> 59:31.652
Cut the crap!

01:00:16.280 --> 01:00:18.365
Come here now! Mr Weng's been shot

01:00:38.969 --> 01:00:40.179
Kill him!

01:00:44.808 --> 01:00:47.061
Kill him!! Don't let him go!

01:00:47.061 --> 01:00:47.436
Mr Weng!

01:00:47.436 --> 01:00:48.854
Mr Weng, you've been hurt!

01:00:48.854 --> 01:00:49.647
Just kill him!

01:00:49.647 --> 01:00:52.191
Let's go! You're in danger

01:00:52.274 --> 01:00:53.442
Get after him!

01:01:27.059 --> 01:01:28.435
If you consider me your friend,

01:01:29.103 --> 01:01:30.396
kill me now

01:01:32.231 --> 01:01:33.315
I loathe seeing you demean yourself

01:01:33.315 --> 01:01:34.858
by begging

01:01:42.324 --> 01:01:43.492
Though I didn't succeed

01:01:43.784 --> 01:01:46.036
I risked my life to get your money

01:01:47.996 --> 01:01:49.164
I could have just killed you

01:01:49.415 --> 01:01:51.542
I didn't have to beg Weng for your money

01:01:52.292 --> 01:01:54.545
I'm not completely without honour, am I?

01:02:19.153 --> 01:02:20.404
Our world is changing so fast

01:02:23.365 --> 01:02:25.617
It never used to be like this

01:02:26.785 --> 01:02:28.245
Perhaps we are too nostalgic

01:02:37.755 --> 01:02:39.214
Nostalgia is one of our saving graces

01:02:41.216 --> 01:02:43.177
At least, when I die,

01:02:43.177 --> 01:02:44.595
I'll know I was remembered by a friend

01:02:46.472 --> 01:02:49.808
Let's settle our dues in the next life

01:03:00.569 --> 01:03:02.112
Think we can cancel them right now,

01:03:03.572 --> 01:03:04.948
that's what friend are for

01:03:07.326 --> 01:03:08.243
Right?

01:03:51.537 --> 01:03:52.162
A drink?

01:03:52.621 --> 01:03:53.455
Thank you

01:03:54.832 --> 01:03:57.709
Jennie always wanted to live by the sea

01:03:59.920 --> 01:04:01.255
You've done so much for her

01:04:03.215 --> 01:04:04.591
I wonder how she feels about you?

01:04:12.516 --> 01:04:13.225
Hello?

01:04:13.225 --> 01:04:14.059
Jennie!

01:04:14.518 --> 01:04:16.311
Jeff, why did you leave me?

01:04:16.603 --> 01:04:17.688
You didn't say goodbye

01:04:17.938 --> 01:04:20.399
I'm sorry I had something to do

01:04:20.566 --> 01:04:22.109
We've got to leave tonight

01:04:24.069 --> 01:04:24.736
Tonight?

01:04:25.279 --> 01:04:26.572
Dr Ho called this afternoon

01:04:26.572 --> 01:04:28.740
He's reserved a pair of corneas,

01:04:28.824 --> 01:04:30.033
but they're in Singapore

01:04:30.158 --> 01:04:31.577
We have to be there by midnight,

01:04:31.869 --> 01:04:33.245
or they automatically to go someone else

01:04:35.247 --> 01:04:36.123
Alright, I'll take you

01:04:37.541 --> 01:04:38.709
Ok, be at the airport at 7:30 tonight

01:04:38.709 --> 01:04:41.295
I'll meet you near Information, you must come

01:04:41.670 --> 01:04:44.047
Of course, bye-bye

01:04:47.342 --> 01:04:48.594
Do you think he'll come?

01:04:58.312 --> 01:04:59.229
Will you go?

01:05:03.692 --> 01:05:04.860
I trust her

01:05:19.499 --> 01:05:21.126
Everybody's here, let's go

01:05:21.752 --> 01:05:22.419
How's it going?

01:05:23.128 --> 01:05:24.212
Right, full alert now

01:05:24.212 --> 01:05:24.922
I want you to check,

01:05:24.922 --> 01:05:26.381
every inch of this place

01:05:29.551 --> 01:05:30.302
Everything's ready

01:05:30.302 --> 01:05:31.386
If he dares to come,

01:05:31.803 --> 01:05:32.971
he will never escape

01:06:26.608 --> 01:06:27.359
Jeff!

01:06:28.151 --> 01:06:30.570
Get away from here, run!

01:06:30.779 --> 01:06:31.863
She's crazy!

01:06:34.324 --> 01:06:35.242
Jeff!

01:06:35.742 --> 01:06:39.663
Jeff, the cops are everywhere, run away!

01:06:40.247 --> 01:06:42.708
Jeff, the cops want you,

01:06:44.126 --> 01:06:47.921
don't come near me

01:06:48.046 --> 01:06:49.297
Jeff, are you there?

01:06:49.297 --> 01:06:50.507
Run

01:06:50.507 --> 01:06:52.009
Don't let them catch you

01:07:04.104 --> 01:07:06.148
Are you alone?

01:07:06.398 --> 01:07:07.733
Run, Jeff!

01:07:12.904 --> 01:07:14.322
The cops are after you

01:07:16.033 --> 01:07:17.367
Freeze!

01:07:19.828 --> 01:07:21.705
Jeff, the cops are all over the place

01:07:24.332 --> 01:07:26.668
Jeff, the cops are everywhere!

01:07:27.335 --> 01:07:28.587
Escape! Please get away!

01:07:31.298 --> 01:07:32.799
Jeff, run!

01:07:35.218 --> 01:07:36.511
It's me, Jennie!

01:07:36.928 --> 01:07:37.846
Don't move

01:07:42.934 --> 01:07:43.894
Let's go

01:07:44.478 --> 01:07:45.479
What is it, officer?

01:07:45.812 --> 01:07:47.522
Flirting is not a crime

01:07:53.904 --> 01:07:54.946
Arrest him!

01:08:06.291 --> 01:08:07.209
Keep clear everyone!

01:08:07.209 --> 01:08:08.960
Let me through!

01:08:13.673 --> 01:08:14.674
Don't move

01:08:18.095 --> 01:08:20.096
Stop!

01:08:20.180 --> 01:08:22.808
Stop! We have to check that luggage

01:08:22.808 --> 01:08:23.892
We're sorry

01:08:23.975 --> 01:08:25.102
Open those suitcases

01:08:27.354 --> 01:08:28.479
What were you doing at the airport?

01:08:28.939 --> 01:08:30.064
Chasing tail!

01:08:30.524 --> 01:08:31.483
What is your job?

01:08:31.942 --> 01:08:37.113
I'm a casting agent for movie companies

01:08:38.365 --> 01:08:39.407
Why did you run and resist arrest?

01:08:40.533 --> 01:08:41.243
I was drunk

01:08:41.868 --> 01:08:43.203
Stand up and walk a straight line

01:08:58.801 --> 01:08:59.803
Where is your friend?

01:09:00.428 --> 01:09:01.888
What friend?

01:09:04.724 --> 01:09:05.975
I'm sure you know who I mean

01:09:06.977 --> 01:09:08.603
He's in grave danger

01:09:12.858 --> 01:09:16.236
Help him, tell me where he is

01:09:17.279 --> 01:09:19.238
I want to help him solve his problem

01:09:20.490 --> 01:09:21.992
I have some questions to ask him

01:09:24.118 --> 01:09:26.037
That's none of my business

01:09:26.830 --> 01:09:30.834
But if the guy you're talking about is my friend

01:09:32.502 --> 01:09:34.504
He sure doesn't need your help

01:09:39.759 --> 01:09:41.595
From now on, you're off Weng's case

01:09:41.595 --> 01:09:43.596
Inspector Chan will take over

01:09:44.555 --> 01:09:45.974
I'm assigning you a new case

01:09:47.767 --> 01:09:48.643
I want an explanation

01:09:48.935 --> 01:09:50.145
I don't trust you

01:09:51.813 --> 01:09:52.939
Siding with the suspect,

01:09:52.939 --> 01:09:55.233
is not the way to catch him

01:09:57.402 --> 01:10:00.155
Sir, you don't understand how I work

01:10:00.697 --> 01:10:04.659
You said it! That's why you're off the case

01:10:08.038 --> 01:10:08.872
I won't give up the investigation

01:10:09.247 --> 01:10:10.248
Bullshit!

01:10:10.832 --> 01:10:14.628
Chang, you're now Chan's assistant

01:10:16.213 --> 01:10:16.963
Yes Sir!

01:10:17.047 --> 01:10:18.715
Release the man you arrested at the airport

01:10:19.216 --> 01:10:20.884
Give him a twenty hour surveillance

01:10:21.176 --> 01:10:22.594
He'll lead us to Weng's assassin

01:10:24.221 --> 01:10:25.180
Have you got that?

01:10:27.307 --> 01:10:28.558
Yes Sir!

01:10:50.830 --> 01:10:52.374
Will you kill again?

01:10:59.631 --> 01:11:02.342
I thought the people I killed deserved to die

01:11:06.805 --> 01:11:07.889
Now, I believe everybody has the right to live

01:11:09.849 --> 01:11:10.767
No, I won't kill again

01:11:11.601 --> 01:11:13.019
I hope I can keep my promise

01:14:36.181 --> 01:14:37.223
I've been followed!

01:14:37.432 --> 01:14:39.809
Weng's men, and the cops too

01:14:41.978 --> 01:14:43.646
Don't worry, I took care of them

01:14:46.065 --> 01:14:47.901
Weng's hired Paul Yau to waste you

01:14:49.444 --> 01:14:52.780
Don't worry, you can use my guns and ammo

01:14:57.368 --> 01:14:58.161
Where are you going?

01:14:59.954 --> 01:15:01.122
To get your money off Weng

01:15:03.249 --> 01:15:04.417
I'll meet you in the church

01:15:06.419 --> 01:15:07.086
Are you going alone?

01:15:07.837 --> 01:15:08.880
Yes, of course

01:15:09.839 --> 01:15:11.007
I have to keep my promise

01:15:13.134 --> 01:15:14.594
Weng is not going to hurt me,

01:15:15.512 --> 01:15:17.055
I still deserve some respect

01:15:18.640 --> 01:15:22.519
Sidney, I don't need the money

01:15:24.020 --> 01:15:25.647
I do need your friendship

01:15:42.914 --> 01:15:47.085
Chang! Chang!

01:15:51.839 --> 01:15:55.760
I followed him to, 6 Horizon Drive

01:15:56.719 --> 01:15:58.137
I almost got him

01:16:00.223 --> 01:16:01.307
I know

01:16:01.307 --> 01:16:02.684
Yes sir! Mr Weng!

01:16:02.684 --> 01:16:05.562
Don't worry, I'll find him

01:16:05.937 --> 01:16:07.355
Chang, don't worry

01:16:08.690 --> 01:16:09.649
Eagle

01:16:11.109 --> 01:16:15.488
You can't win all the time

01:16:16.656 --> 01:16:18.700
But you can't lose forever either

01:16:24.789 --> 01:16:27.709
Chang! Chang!

01:16:47.812 --> 01:16:50.023
Inspector Li, did he give us anything?

01:16:51.899 --> 01:16:53.192
Go ask him yourself!

01:18:16.818 --> 01:18:17.485
Jeff!

01:18:18.111 --> 01:18:21.280
Jennie, what is it?

01:18:23.449 --> 01:18:24.701
Why's it so dark this morning?

01:18:26.577 --> 01:18:28.788
It's just a cloudy day

01:18:31.582 --> 01:18:34.210
Relax, it'll be alright?

01:18:36.045 --> 01:18:37.213
Are we leaving today?

01:18:37.463 --> 01:18:38.506
Yes

01:18:42.009 --> 01:18:42.802
Freeze!

01:18:43.803 --> 01:18:44.721
Who is it?

01:18:45.763 --> 01:18:46.639
It's Dumbo!

01:18:47.765 --> 01:18:48.599
What does he want?

01:18:49.267 --> 01:18:50.476
He's come to say goodbye

01:18:54.772 --> 01:18:55.690
What're you waiting for?

01:18:56.232 --> 01:18:59.235
I'm a cop, I don't shoot people in the back

01:18:59.652 --> 01:19:00.945
Another way we're the same

01:19:01.070 --> 01:19:02.363
No we're not the same!

01:19:03.448 --> 01:19:05.116
I uphold the law and you break it!

01:19:06.826 --> 01:19:07.952
Chang died because of you

01:19:08.619 --> 01:19:10.121
I swore I'd get you this time

01:19:15.418 --> 01:19:16.252
I'm sorry

01:19:17.670 --> 01:19:19.255
But I won't let you put me in prison

01:19:21.340 --> 01:19:22.967
If you must take revenge for your friend

01:19:23.843 --> 01:19:24.969
Shoot me now

01:19:26.137 --> 01:19:27.346
Don't force me to kill you

01:19:46.032 --> 01:19:47.533
So you really would kill me?

01:19:47.700 --> 01:19:49.076
I won't let you go this time

01:19:49.660 --> 01:19:50.703
Ok let's see it

01:19:51.746 --> 01:19:53.039
You can't win all the time

01:19:53.414 --> 01:19:54.665
Jeff, where are you?

01:19:54.665 --> 01:19:55.750
Jeff!

01:19:56.626 --> 01:19:58.544
Where's Dumbo? Where is he?

01:19:59.462 --> 01:20:00.254
Right in front of you

01:20:02.423 --> 01:20:03.424
Don't take him away

01:20:03.508 --> 01:20:04.217
Jennie!

01:20:04.300 --> 01:20:06.177
Jeff's promised me he'll never kill again

01:20:06.719 --> 01:20:07.804
Put that gun down

01:20:07.970 --> 01:20:09.263
Jennie, put that gun down

01:20:09.347 --> 01:20:11.641
Not unless he leaves us alone

01:20:12.475 --> 01:20:14.644
I beg you, please, let us go

01:20:14.727 --> 01:20:16.771
- Jennie!
- I'll never let you arrest him

01:20:18.564 --> 01:20:20.983
Did I kill him? Is he dead?

01:20:21.484 --> 01:20:24.779
I didn't mean to kill him, I didn't mean it

01:20:25.112 --> 01:20:26.113
He's alright

01:20:27.406 --> 01:20:28.866
I didn't mean to

01:20:32.954 --> 01:20:33.996
He's alright

01:21:39.770 --> 01:21:41.439
Calm down, be brave

01:21:42.315 --> 01:21:43.024
You stay there!

01:21:43.024 --> 01:21:44.817
Jeff...Jeff

01:22:10.009 --> 01:22:11.969
Let's get out of here, then you can arrest me

01:22:19.644 --> 01:22:21.270
Let's get Jennie out of here

01:22:22.939 --> 01:22:23.940
The car's outside

01:22:58.224 --> 01:22:59.225
Come on!

01:23:45.896 --> 01:23:47.314
I won't let you put me behind bars

01:23:48.607 --> 01:23:49.650
Throw the gun down

01:23:56.699 --> 01:23:57.867
I know you won't kill a cop

01:24:44.163 --> 01:24:45.122
Thank you

01:24:47.917 --> 01:24:49.668
You could have killed me with one shot

01:24:50.711 --> 01:24:52.129
I don't kill anybody

01:24:52.671 --> 01:24:53.756
until I know they are the real enemy

01:24:53.923 --> 01:24:55.007
Do you really know me?

01:24:57.301 --> 01:24:58.886
Sometimes fate controls everything

01:25:01.138 --> 01:25:06.060
The only person who really knows me
turns out to be a cop

01:25:06.560 --> 01:25:07.853
But you could always give up

01:25:09.772 --> 01:25:13.943
No, I've made a promise,

01:25:13.943 --> 01:25:14.902
I keep my word

01:25:15.569 --> 01:25:16.946
Sometimes, I really envy your freedom

01:25:18.864 --> 01:25:21.492
I just don't have it

01:25:23.160 --> 01:25:24.161
I believe in justice

01:25:25.121 --> 01:25:26.205
but nobody trusts me

01:25:27.373 --> 01:25:28.791
I have the same problem

01:25:32.169 --> 01:25:33.504
You're an unusual cop

01:25:35.422 --> 01:25:37.007
And you're an unusual killer too

01:25:40.636 --> 01:25:42.847
I'm sorry to drag you into this mess

01:25:43.097 --> 01:25:44.765
Tell me, who is behind all this?

01:25:45.182 --> 01:25:48.102
That's not my game, I play by the rules

01:25:50.062 --> 01:25:51.605
I knew you'd never tell me

01:25:53.566 --> 01:25:55.025
Take care of Jennie

01:25:56.652 --> 01:25:57.820
Weng won't stop untill he kills you

01:25:58.821 --> 01:25:59.905
You'd better let me arrest you

01:26:24.680 --> 01:26:25.890
We'll stay here tonight

01:26:26.432 --> 01:26:27.766
Then Sidney will bring me my money,

01:26:27.766 --> 01:26:29.143
and we'll leave tomorrow

01:26:29.935 --> 01:26:32.021
I'm scared those gangsters will find us here

01:26:34.481 --> 01:26:35.316
Don't worry

01:26:37.067 --> 01:26:39.069
This is an out of the way place

01:26:43.699 --> 01:26:44.992
Why is it so dark?

01:26:47.953 --> 01:26:49.496
I can hardly see anything

01:26:51.624 --> 01:26:54.001
Jeff, turn on the lights, please

01:26:54.543 --> 01:26:56.295
Why don't you turn on the lights?

01:27:01.050 --> 01:27:02.009
Jeff!

01:27:10.559 --> 01:27:11.894
Jeff, turn on the lights!

01:27:12.102 --> 01:27:15.147
There has been a power cut

01:27:21.570 --> 01:27:23.155
Will your friend come back with the money?

01:27:26.075 --> 01:27:30.621
I'm sure he will

01:27:34.500 --> 01:27:35.209
Boss

01:27:35.584 --> 01:27:37.419
Here's the US$100,000. Please check it

01:27:38.003 --> 01:27:39.797
Do you think Paul Yau will be able to kill Jeff?

01:27:52.935 --> 01:27:55.062
Boss, Sidney Fung's here

01:27:56.814 --> 01:27:59.191
If he betrays you again, then what?

01:28:05.364 --> 01:28:06.824
I'd still treat him as my friend

01:28:07.908 --> 01:28:09.368
He was so good to me

01:28:14.498 --> 01:28:15.374
Where is Jeff's money?

01:28:15.374 --> 01:28:16.583
Where the hell is he?

01:28:17.876 --> 01:28:19.962
I wish I could have a friend like you

01:28:22.548 --> 01:28:25.384
You will, one of these days

01:28:41.025 --> 01:28:42.943
Drop your guns!

01:28:46.947 --> 01:28:48.073
Your right hand still works?

01:28:48.157 --> 01:28:49.074
Yes, well enough

01:28:49.908 --> 01:28:51.327
It still fires a gun, fast and accurate

01:28:51.744 --> 01:28:53.162
You've got no way out,

01:28:53.746 --> 01:28:54.830
why're you doing all this?

01:28:55.497 --> 01:28:56.915
You tell me, what's the alternative?

01:28:58.417 --> 01:28:59.251
Where's the money?

01:29:00.627 --> 01:29:01.587
Give it!

01:29:16.393 --> 01:29:17.311
I'm one step ahead

01:29:17.811 --> 01:29:19.104
Why didn't you shoot me in the head?

01:29:19.188 --> 01:29:20.314
Right

01:29:21.440 --> 01:29:23.233
Maybe I'm just not a professional anymore

01:29:27.237 --> 01:29:29.948
I wish I could start all over again

01:29:32.368 --> 01:29:33.160
It's a pity

01:29:38.499 --> 01:29:39.958
Give me the cash

01:29:40.209 --> 01:29:41.126
Where is Jeff?

01:29:41.377 --> 01:29:43.253
Give me the money first

01:29:47.633 --> 01:29:49.593
We owe it to him

01:29:51.053 --> 01:29:52.012
Hypocrite!

01:29:57.601 --> 01:29:59.812
Do all killers have a sense of honor?

01:30:00.437 --> 01:30:03.399
Our world is changing so fast, honor's

01:30:07.486 --> 01:30:09.863
Sidney, sometimes I think you're not human

01:30:10.114 --> 01:30:11.532
You're more like a dog

01:30:16.036 --> 01:30:17.538
At least we have one thing in common

01:30:18.455 --> 01:30:19.832
We both use guns for our living

01:30:23.585 --> 01:30:25.212
Just our motivation's different

01:30:26.296 --> 01:30:27.214
Right?

01:30:30.551 --> 01:30:32.761
In some ways dogs are superior to men

01:30:42.813 --> 01:30:44.064
If you don't tell me where Jeff is

01:30:44.064 --> 01:30:45.190
This is your funeral

01:30:46.525 --> 01:30:47.943
Throw this garbage away

01:31:09.506 --> 01:31:10.340
Give me the money

01:31:10.841 --> 01:31:12.050
Are you sure you still got bullets?

01:31:13.927 --> 01:31:14.887
You want a bet?

01:31:16.013 --> 01:31:19.433
Jeff said, always save one last slug

01:31:20.142 --> 01:31:22.352
Either for yourself, or your enemy

01:31:36.492 --> 01:31:37.576
Quick!

01:31:40.662 --> 01:31:41.747
Turn around!

01:31:51.048 --> 01:31:52.758
Godamnit!

01:31:58.847 --> 01:31:59.848
Get him!

01:32:07.856 --> 01:32:09.399
I want you to promise me one thing

01:32:11.151 --> 01:32:13.695
if I don't make it

01:32:14.988 --> 01:32:16.198
Take me to a hospital

01:32:16.782 --> 01:32:18.534
Get the doctors to operate,
my corneas are for Jennie

01:32:21.203 --> 01:32:24.957
If you can't do that, organize my money

01:32:25.040 --> 01:32:26.208
and send her abroad for surgery

01:32:29.795 --> 01:32:31.046
Don't think like that

01:32:34.758 --> 01:32:38.804
It's the first decent thing I've ever done

01:32:39.930 --> 01:32:41.098
Will you help me?

01:33:16.133 --> 01:33:17.259
What's that noise?

01:33:19.469 --> 01:33:20.596
Who is it Jeff?

01:33:20.596 --> 01:33:21.805
It's Sidney Fung

01:33:32.149 --> 01:33:33.150
Sidney

01:33:39.948 --> 01:33:45.162
Here's your money I fought for it like a man

01:33:49.708 --> 01:33:54.004
This is my last tribute to a friend

01:33:55.505 --> 01:33:58.425
Sidney, you didn't have to do this

01:34:15.025 --> 01:34:16.943
He said I was a dog

01:34:18.779 --> 01:34:20.822
Now I'm not sure if I'm human,

01:34:21.948 --> 01:34:23.200
or a dog?

01:34:23.950 --> 01:34:26.453
Sidney, nobody can call you a dog

01:34:28.205 --> 01:34:29.831
Sidney, Sidney!

01:34:34.378 --> 01:34:35.754
Sidney!

01:34:43.512 --> 01:34:46.431
Sidney, Sidney, are you alright?

01:34:48.600 --> 01:34:50.352
Am I a dog?

01:34:52.187 --> 01:34:57.776
No, you're not a dog. You're a great man!

01:34:58.485 --> 01:35:01.822
We're outmoded characters,
outcasts of our community

01:35:04.241 --> 01:35:07.202
I don't want to die like a dog

01:35:12.207 --> 01:35:15.127
But you see, I didn't keep one last bullet

01:35:17.504 --> 01:35:18.880
I have one

01:35:21.049 --> 01:35:22.551
I have one

01:36:04.551 --> 01:36:05.177
Jeff!

01:36:05.260 --> 01:36:06.011
Jennie, stay where you are

01:36:06.011 --> 01:36:07.053
Don't leave me alone!

01:36:08.263 --> 01:36:09.306
What are you going to do?

01:36:11.266 --> 01:36:12.184
Storm my way out!

01:36:12.309 --> 01:36:13.351
Don't kill anymore, please?

01:36:13.727 --> 01:36:15.103
Give up your guns and come with me

01:36:16.480 --> 01:36:20.984
What? You say me kill Sidney

01:36:21.151 --> 01:36:22.778
He was my best friend

01:36:23.278 --> 01:36:24.654
And you dare to tell me to give up?

01:36:28.408 --> 01:36:29.367
When Chang died

01:36:29.367 --> 01:36:31.119
I swore I'd kill you

01:36:32.704 --> 01:36:34.206
But now I don't want you to get killed

01:36:35.415 --> 01:36:36.583
Get out of here with Jennie

01:36:38.251 --> 01:36:39.002
How?

01:36:39.836 --> 01:36:41.463
They'll chase me to the ends of the earth

01:36:42.339 --> 01:36:43.882
I have nowhere to go

01:36:45.091 --> 01:36:47.719
Get out there and tell them you're cop,

01:36:48.428 --> 01:36:49.971
see if they give up their guns

01:37:09.366 --> 01:37:10.450
- Jennie!
- Jeff!

01:37:16.873 --> 01:37:18.250
Jeff!

01:37:35.559 --> 01:37:36.560
Dumbo!

01:37:36.810 --> 01:37:38.979
Thanks, Mickey Mouse!

01:37:56.496 --> 01:37:58.832
Dumbo, I owe you

01:37:59.708 --> 01:38:00.667
You don't owe me nothing

01:38:01.126 --> 01:38:02.419
This is the gift of friendship

01:38:02.752 --> 01:38:03.753
Good luck!

01:39:13.949 --> 01:39:15.533
Jennie, take cover!

01:39:19.913 --> 01:39:21.081
Don't move!

01:39:25.460 --> 01:39:26.503
Jennie!

01:39:27.462 --> 01:39:28.672
Jennie!

01:40:57.218 --> 01:40:58.511
Dumbo!

01:40:59.095 --> 01:41:00.013
Give me gun!

01:41:00.305 --> 01:41:01.765
Mickey Mouse, here!

01:41:25.705 --> 01:41:26.831
How good a shot are you?

01:41:27.332 --> 01:41:28.625
I'm a cop, I've got to be good!

01:42:04.244 --> 01:42:05.411
We've been through so much together,

01:42:06.121 --> 01:42:07.330
I don't even know your name

01:42:09.124 --> 01:42:09.958
Is it important?

01:42:10.375 --> 01:42:12.085
Whether we win or lose,

01:42:12.710 --> 01:42:13.962
you ain't going to be around

01:42:14.337 --> 01:42:16.339
I'd like to have a name to remember you by forever

01:42:17.757 --> 01:42:20.635
Would you rather see me dead or set free?

01:42:21.719 --> 01:42:24.514
If fate spares us, I don't want either

01:42:25.890 --> 01:42:27.183
You're a helluva good friend!

01:42:29.310 --> 01:42:31.187
Remember me as Mickey Mouse, why not?

01:43:26.826 --> 01:43:27.660
Come back!

01:43:27.660 --> 01:43:28.536
I must find my friend

01:43:30.205 --> 01:43:31.664
Leave her alone, she's innocent!

01:43:32.790 --> 01:43:33.583
Move!

01:43:34.209 --> 01:43:34.918
Move!

01:43:53.019 --> 01:43:53.853
Drop your gun!

01:43:54.437 --> 01:43:55.688
Drop your gun

01:43:56.272 --> 01:43:57.482
Godamnit! You heard me? Hurry up!

01:44:00.735 --> 01:44:04.197
Jeff, where are you, Jeff?

01:44:04.447 --> 01:44:08.284
Jennie, don't be afraid, I'm in front of you

01:44:08.868 --> 01:44:10.328
Drop your gun

01:44:13.665 --> 01:44:14.874
Jennie, don't move an inch

01:44:17.335 --> 01:44:18.461
Don't hurt her

01:44:19.003 --> 01:44:20.129
No, I won't hurt her

01:44:20.755 --> 01:44:21.756
I'll just kill her

01:44:22.715 --> 01:44:23.633
Release her!

01:44:23.800 --> 01:44:25.009
Stop

01:44:27.929 --> 01:44:28.846
Let her go

01:44:28.972 --> 01:44:29.847
No way!

01:44:36.688 --> 01:44:37.689
What if I don't?

01:44:45.280 --> 01:44:46.447
Drop your guns!

01:44:58.459 --> 01:44:59.335
Dumbo!

01:45:01.170 --> 01:45:05.091
Will you do what you've promised?

01:45:08.636 --> 01:45:09.595
No problem

01:45:12.015 --> 01:45:15.977
Don't forget, there's always a friend
to back you up!

01:45:25.737 --> 01:45:28.489
Drop the guns, or I'll kill her

01:45:48.176 --> 01:45:50.053
Drop your guns, idiots!

01:46:29.592 --> 01:46:31.344
Mickey Mouse

01:46:34.722 --> 01:46:35.848
Mickey Mouse

01:46:48.778 --> 01:46:50.154
Mickey Mouse

01:47:13.970 --> 01:47:15.263
Jeff!

01:47:15.555 --> 01:47:16.639
Jennie!

01:47:19.058 --> 01:47:23.104
Jeff, where are you?

01:47:30.570 --> 01:47:31.988
Jeff!

01:48:12.361 --> 01:48:13.738
Jeff!

01:48:21.662 --> 01:48:22.622
Don't move!

01:48:22.622 --> 01:48:24.999
Ok! Ok! I surrender,

01:48:24.999 --> 01:48:28.169
I'll cooperate, arrest me please!

01:48:31.380 --> 01:48:32.465
You're an unusual cop

01:48:33.424 --> 01:48:34.634
And you're an unusual killer too

01:48:37.762 --> 01:48:38.971
I believe in justice

01:48:39.847 --> 01:48:41.098
but nobody trusts me

01:48:42.225 --> 01:48:43.518
I have the same problem

01:48:46.312 --> 01:48:47.146
Arrest him

01:48:47.396 --> 01:48:48.189
I'll do it!

01:48:49.273 --> 01:48:52.652
Arrest me, arrest me

01:48:52.944 --> 01:48:55.446
Arrest me! I'm asking for police custody!

01:48:55.446 --> 01:48:56.948
I'm a criminal, arrest me!

01:49:20.680 --> 01:49:22.098
Mickey Mouse...

01:49:28.854 --> 01:49:30.273
Mickey Mouse...
