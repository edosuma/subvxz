[groan]

00:34.559 --> 00:36.760
What was that awful sound?

00:36.920 --> 00:38.839
I don't know. I heard it too.

00:39.000 --> 00:40.360
[groan]

00:44.800 --> 00:47.640
Ollie? Did you hear that strange sound?

00:48.160 --> 00:51.640
-Strange sound?
-Yes! Like an angry balloon.

00:51.760 --> 00:53.519
Or a super-squeaky fridge door.

00:53.640 --> 00:57.199
-Or a dolphin with a cold!
-Nope. Nothing like that.

00:58.199 --> 01:00.160
[groan]

01:00.320 --> 01:03.320
-Ollie, was that sound you?
-I guess.

01:03.480 --> 01:04.759
It's this loose tooth.

01:04.879 --> 01:06.679
Argh!

01:06.800 --> 01:09.640
It won't come out,
and I can't eat this cheese!

01:09.759 --> 01:11.759
It hurts too much to bite!

01:11.920 --> 01:13.759
[groans]

01:13.920 --> 01:15.920
Let me help you get that tooth out.

01:16.039 --> 01:18.440
No, it'll fall out on its own.

01:18.560 --> 01:20.479
OK. We'll try it your way.

01:20.600 --> 01:22.039
[clock ticks]

01:22.200 --> 01:23.440
[screams in pain]

01:23.560 --> 01:25.320
That's it. Doing it my way!

01:25.440 --> 01:28.160
Why, I'm the best
tooth getter-outer in town!

01:28.320 --> 01:31.320
They call me the Tooth Whisperer.

01:32.880 --> 01:34.119
Really?

01:34.280 --> 01:36.360
OK, Moon. For you.

01:37.119 --> 01:37.960
Aaaaa.

01:38.119 --> 01:41.600
Hi, tooth. Wanna come out and play?

01:41.720 --> 01:43.839
The Tooth Fairy is waiting, you know,

01:44.000 --> 01:45.720
and she's really busy.

01:45.880 --> 01:48.640
She's not gonna wait forever.

01:48.920 --> 01:50.720
What'll it take
to get you outta that mouth

01:50.880 --> 01:52.880
and into the good life?

01:53.240 --> 01:55.479
So you wanna play tough, huh, tooth?

01:55.640 --> 01:59.000
Fine. I'm bringing in my secret weapon.

01:59.880 --> 02:02.080
The sticky English toffee!

02:02.559 --> 02:03.440
[gasps]

02:03.559 --> 02:07.280
But that's the chewiest, stickiest candy
in the whole world!

02:07.399 --> 02:10.519
With a tooth like this, it's the only way.

02:10.680 --> 02:13.799
But one bite,
the tooth will stick to the toffee

02:13.960 --> 02:15.519
and out it comes!

02:15.640 --> 02:19.640
Luckily, I have one precious piece left!

02:27.640 --> 02:28.720
Uh-oh.

02:29.000 --> 02:29.920
Hmm.

02:32.519 --> 02:33.720
No!

02:38.519 --> 02:40.600
Wait! I'm having a brainstorm.

02:40.720 --> 02:43.359
Uh-oh. When you have a brainstorm,

02:43.480 --> 02:45.440
I always get dragged off someplace.

02:45.560 --> 02:47.440
We'll go to England to get more!

02:47.560 --> 02:49.400
-England?
-Of course!

02:49.519 --> 02:53.239
The best sticky toffee in the world
comes from England.

02:53.359 --> 02:56.600
Plus, my cousin, Sir Bret,
is the first toffee maker to the Queen!

02:56.760 --> 02:59.239
I'll text him to meet us
at Buckingham Palace.

02:59.400 --> 03:02.679
We're gonna help you, Ollie.
That's what friends are for!

03:02.840 --> 03:06.840
-Since you put it that way...
-Tally-ho, to England we go!

03:15.160 --> 03:16.880
Whee!

03:24.120 --> 03:28.040
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>now arriving in England!</i>

03:32.799 --> 03:37.399
Wow! Buckingham Palace.
The Queen has a big house!

03:37.519 --> 03:40.679
Did you know it has 78 bathrooms?

03:40.799 --> 03:42.640
Now that's my kind of place!

03:42.880 --> 03:46.239
-Gate's locked, though.
-And Sir Bret is not answering.

03:46.399 --> 03:49.079
Then how do we get inside
to see him and get the toffee?

03:49.239 --> 03:50.320
Guess we can't!

03:50.480 --> 03:52.239
Oh, well, we tried. Let's go home!

03:52.359 --> 03:54.399
Maybe there's another way in.

03:55.959 --> 03:59.119
Wait! That hat! It's fuzz-beautiful!

03:59.880 --> 04:01.079
I gotta have one!

04:01.200 --> 04:02.200
You, too, guys!

04:02.320 --> 04:03.200
Yay!

04:03.320 --> 04:04.359
[giggles]

04:05.560 --> 04:07.920
Come on guys, selfie time. Say cheese!

04:08.040 --> 04:08.880
[groans]

04:09.000 --> 04:10.160
Cheese!

04:10.399 --> 04:12.280
Look! It's a fuzzy parade!

04:12.440 --> 04:13.959
They're going in where Sir Bret is!

04:14.079 --> 04:15.920
-Follow them!
-Actually, Moon--

04:16.039 --> 04:17.680
Don't you just love the way they walk?

04:17.800 --> 04:21.399
But, Moon,
these guys with the fuzzy hats, they're--

04:21.519 --> 04:23.000
Pretty? Popular?

04:23.120 --> 04:24.159
Pleasing to the eye?

04:24.320 --> 04:26.680
-No visitors here!
-Whoa!

04:27.280 --> 04:28.400
Oof.

04:29.760 --> 04:33.719
No, palace guards.
And only guards are allowed in that way.

04:34.000 --> 04:37.919
Guess we better head home
and wait for my tooth to fall out.

04:38.080 --> 04:39.240
[groans]

04:39.360 --> 04:42.719
No way!
I'm not letting you suffer another minute.

04:42.840 --> 04:45.880
We're finding that toffee
and getting that tooth out!

04:46.440 --> 04:49.240
Wait! There's Sir Bret, on the bus!

04:53.479 --> 04:55.440
Stop that bus!

05:00.640 --> 05:03.159
-Sir Bret!
-Sir Bret!

05:03.320 --> 05:06.960
Excuse me! Sorry, ma'am!

05:07.080 --> 05:08.039
Sorry!

05:09.000 --> 05:11.440
Left my package up top!

05:11.599 --> 05:15.159
[they keep calling out]

05:15.320 --> 05:16.599
Sir Bret!

05:18.360 --> 05:20.280
-Sorry about that.
-Sir Bret!

05:20.440 --> 05:22.039
-Excuse me.
-Sir Bret!

05:22.200 --> 05:25.080
-About the slime, sorry!
-Sir Bret!

05:25.240 --> 05:28.599
-Oh, dear. There it is.
-Sir Bret!

05:37.159 --> 05:40.000
[gasps] Sir Bret! Finally!

05:40.560 --> 05:42.840
We've been looking and looking for you!

05:42.960 --> 05:46.560
[muffled by toffee]
Stanley! I'm so glad to see you!

05:46.680 --> 05:48.960
These are the friends
I was telling you about.

05:49.080 --> 05:50.280
Ollie's got the loose tooth.

05:50.400 --> 05:51.240
We were hoping

05:51.359 --> 05:53.680
you might have some toffee
for us to help get it out.

05:53.840 --> 05:55.240
Mmm-hmm. Aaaaaaa.

05:55.479 --> 05:59.120
[muffled] Oh, that's a big one.

05:59.280 --> 06:00.919
I can't understand a word he's saying.

06:01.039 --> 06:04.080
I think he's got a mouth
full of sticky toffee.

06:04.200 --> 06:08.280
[muffled]
Then let's go over to the toffee factory.

06:08.400 --> 06:09.479
[embarrassed laugh]

06:09.599 --> 06:10.440
Sure!

06:10.560 --> 06:14.159
We'd love to have a look
at your toffee factory while we're here.

06:14.280 --> 06:15.919
I speak fluent toffee.

06:16.039 --> 06:19.200
[muffled]

06:19.799 --> 06:23.000
Oh! But first some tea and cake!

06:23.120 --> 06:26.520
See? You're learning fast!
Now get ready to sit a while.

06:26.640 --> 06:29.479
The English like to take
their time with tea.

06:32.960 --> 06:34.599
Mmm. Delicious.

06:34.719 --> 06:38.039
[muffled]
If you like that, try some cheese!

06:38.919 --> 06:42.320
Ah! Cheese! [groans]

06:43.440 --> 06:45.280
Excuse us! We have to...

06:45.799 --> 06:47.400
not be here. Bye!

06:48.200 --> 06:51.560
Come on, Ollie.
While they take forever with tea,

06:51.680 --> 06:53.280
we'll get you that toffee!

06:53.960 --> 06:56.280
Whoa! Slippery floor!

06:57.400 --> 06:59.640
Whoa! Ah!

06:59.760 --> 07:01.359
What happened? Where are we?

07:01.479 --> 07:03.760
Are we moving? Whoa!

07:03.880 --> 07:07.479
Whoa! We're on the sticky-toffee tester
assembly line!

07:07.599 --> 07:09.960
Watch out for the toffee twirlers!

07:10.080 --> 07:11.479
Whoa!

07:12.719 --> 07:15.039
-Want more?
-Well, thank you.

07:16.640 --> 07:19.159
Watch out for the toffee shakers!

07:19.280 --> 07:24.479
-[vibrating] Whoa!
-You sound like a motorboat!

07:25.239 --> 07:27.159
-[muffled] Cake?
-Mmm-hmm!

07:27.280 --> 07:29.320
Whoa! Toffee stretchers!

07:29.440 --> 07:32.400
[laughter]

07:32.560 --> 07:33.960
Tickles!

07:37.719 --> 07:38.719
Ah!

07:39.280 --> 07:42.719
They've been gone a while.
I'll just go check on them.

07:43.919 --> 07:47.120
-Whoa!
-Guys? Everything--?

07:48.919 --> 07:52.200
Now can we please go home
and wait for my tooth to fall out?

07:52.320 --> 07:54.680
But, Ollie, we can't give up now!

07:54.799 --> 07:56.120
Can we give up soon?

07:56.239 --> 07:58.799
Look, we're covered in sticky toffee!

07:58.919 --> 08:02.000
You've got to be able
to reach some with your mouth!

08:02.280 --> 08:05.560
Please let's just go home.
Things couldn't be worse!

08:10.039 --> 08:14.560
No! We're going back in there
and getting toffee for my friend.

08:14.719 --> 08:18.080

but just because you're my friend.

be patient.

09:02.959 --> 09:06.319
But instead, I came all the way here

09:06.439 --> 09:09.600
and I got kicked out of the Queen's palace

09:10.079 --> 09:13.280
and twirled and stretched
and covered in...

I'm sorry, Ollie.
I just wanted to help you get--

-It's out.
-Ha, ha!

09:30.160 --> 09:31.959
-What?
-It is!

09:32.920 --> 09:35.199
It's out!

09:35.480 --> 09:38.120
And, hang on, now I'm jumping up and down!

09:39.880 --> 09:42.240
Because we're not stuck together any more!

09:42.360 --> 09:44.680

must have dissolved the toffee!

09:44.800 --> 09:47.520

-Uh... I had a brainstorm?
-Yes!

that I yelled my tooth out

of West Country English Cheddar.
