EVERYBODY HATES CHRIS #045
"E.H. the Guidance Counselor"
CLOSED CAPTIONED

00:02.803 --> 00:04.072
("What I Like About You"
by The Romantics playing)

00:04.105 --> 00:06.207
CHRIS ROCK:
When I entered the ninth grade
at Corleone,

00:06.240 --> 00:07.341
even though I was still
in a junior high building,

00:07.375 --> 00:09.743
it was technically
my first year of high school.

00:09.777 --> 00:12.246
Some things remained
the same...

00:12.280 --> 00:13.414
Welcome back, Jungle Love.

00:13.447 --> 00:15.216
...and some things changed
totally.

00:15.249 --> 00:19.153
Namely, everything I did from
then on would affect my future.

00:19.187 --> 00:21.622
At the end of the eighth grade,
every student had to take

00:21.655 --> 00:24.258
the Grade 8
Proficiency Assessment test.

00:24.292 --> 00:28.729
The G.E.P.A., or GEPA,
assesses your progress

00:28.762 --> 00:32.633
and addresses any changes you
might need in your curriculum.

00:32.666 --> 00:34.335
So we're not getting
a grade on this?

00:34.368 --> 00:36.304
Technically, no.
That's technically great

00:36.337 --> 00:39.140
'cause I technically
didn't study.

00:39.173 --> 00:41.609
So did you get
your test scores back yet?

00:41.642 --> 00:43.477
Not yet, but I'm not worried
about it, though.

00:43.511 --> 00:45.346
They said the test doesn't
count towards your grade,

00:45.379 --> 00:46.380
so what difference
does it make?

00:46.414 --> 00:48.182
A lot.

00:48.216 --> 00:49.417
* Hey.

00:49.450 --> 00:50.718
Chris, after
looking

00:50.751 --> 00:53.687
at your test results,
I'm very concerned.

00:53.721 --> 00:56.090
I'd been getting my ass whooped
for two years

00:56.124 --> 00:58.159
and now she's concerned?

00:58.192 --> 00:59.193
What are you concerned about?

00:59.227 --> 01:01.662
You did horribly
on your test.

01:01.695 --> 01:02.796
With that on your record,

01:02.830 --> 01:06.167
it could seriously harm your
chances of going to college,

01:06.200 --> 01:08.702
even if you get
a basketball scholarship.

01:08.736 --> 01:10.104
Is she crazy?

01:10.138 --> 01:11.239
There's no grades
they won't take

01:11.272 --> 01:12.706
if you can play basketball.

01:12.740 --> 01:14.508
I thought the test didn't count.
Chris,

01:14.542 --> 01:15.509
everything counts.

01:15.543 --> 01:16.410
You should know that.

01:16.444 --> 01:18.246
I would expect Greg
to get suckered in

01:18.279 --> 01:19.313
by someone saying that,

01:19.347 --> 01:21.315
but with all your street smarts,

01:21.349 --> 01:23.151
you should know better
than that.

01:23.184 --> 01:26.420
I'm sure with all the
careers available with...

01:26.454 --> 01:30.358
hair care companies
and dance show hosting,

01:30.391 --> 01:31.859
it's hard to decide,

01:31.892 --> 01:34.128
but you're going to have to
apply yourself, even for that.

01:34.162 --> 01:37.798
Hair care companies
and dance show hosting?

01:37.831 --> 01:41.235
My point is: to help you get off
on the good foot,

01:41.269 --> 01:42.470
I've made an appointment for you

01:42.503 --> 01:43.904
to see
the new guidance counselor.

01:43.937 --> 01:45.573
Guidance counselor?

01:45.606 --> 01:47.475
All I knew
about guidance counselors

01:47.508 --> 01:49.143
was that you usually went
to see them

01:49.177 --> 01:50.611
because there was
something wrong with you.

01:50.644 --> 01:51.679
So you're Chris.

01:51.712 --> 01:52.546
Yes, sir.

01:52.580 --> 01:55.749
I'm Mr. Abbott,
your guidance counselor.

01:55.783 --> 01:56.817
Having problems, huh?

01:56.850 --> 01:58.852
Yeah, my teacher says I need
some help figuring out

01:58.886 --> 02:00.321
what I want to do
with my future.

02:00.354 --> 02:01.789
You can say that again.

02:01.822 --> 02:03.023
What do you mean?

02:03.056 --> 02:05.559
Chris, what do you want to do
when you get out of school?

02:05.593 --> 02:07.228
I don't know.

02:07.261 --> 02:09.163
You know, you got
about as much direction

02:09.197 --> 02:10.298
as a broken compass.

02:10.331 --> 02:11.532
I'm surprised
you were even able

02:11.565 --> 02:12.933
to find your way to this office.

02:12.966 --> 02:14.702
According
to this test,

02:14.735 --> 02:16.837
you put the "upid" in "stupid."

02:16.870 --> 02:18.506
The way I see it,
you're about...

02:18.539 --> 02:20.908
two bad decisions away
from a life of crime.

02:20.941 --> 02:22.243
I don't know anything
about crime.

02:22.276 --> 02:23.744
Make that one bad decision.

02:23.777 --> 02:25.479
Can you help me?

02:25.513 --> 02:27.248
Well, unless they hire Big Bird,

02:27.281 --> 02:29.250
I'm going to have to.

02:37.525 --> 02:39.860
* Ah, make it funky now.

02:54.808 --> 02:58.812

PARAMOUNT TELEVISION

03:02.350 --> 03:04.652
I tanked the test because
I thought it didn't count.

03:04.685 --> 03:07.355
Looking at my grades,
you'd think I couldn't count.

03:07.388 --> 03:09.723
How did you even make it
into ninth grade?

03:09.757 --> 03:11.792
I mean, they should have
picked up on this years ago.

03:11.825 --> 03:12.660
How many did
I get wrong?

03:12.693 --> 03:14.862
It's a skills assessment test,
Chris,

03:14.895 --> 03:16.464
and basically what it says is

03:16.497 --> 03:19.467
that you don't have
the propensity for any skill.

03:19.500 --> 03:21.302
Propensity?

03:21.335 --> 03:22.169
I got propensity.

03:22.202 --> 03:23.871
Do you even know
what "propensity" means?

03:23.904 --> 03:24.872
No.

03:24.905 --> 03:27.641
Okay, maybe it's not that bad.

03:27.675 --> 03:29.310
I'm going to have to help you.

03:29.343 --> 03:30.311
That's my job.

03:30.344 --> 03:32.380
I'm the "guidance" counselor.

03:32.413 --> 03:34.448
But I'm going to have
to run some more tests.

03:34.482 --> 03:36.016
More tests? What
are these tests for?

03:36.049 --> 03:38.719
Well, I'm going to have to build
a psychological profile.

03:38.752 --> 03:40.588
You're giving me a crazy test?

03:40.621 --> 03:42.022
No, it's not
a crazy test.

03:42.055 --> 03:44.292
It's to see
if you're good at anything.

03:44.325 --> 03:45.693
One question.

03:45.726 --> 03:47.495
Are these tests important?

03:47.528 --> 03:50.998
Well, unless you want to start
taking a little bus to school,

03:51.031 --> 03:52.566
they're very important.

03:52.600 --> 03:54.302
I'll see you
tomorrow.

03:54.335 --> 03:56.870
While the guidance counselor
worked on a plan for my future,

03:56.904 --> 03:59.807
my father had a plan
for my present.

03:59.840 --> 04:01.008
Hey, baby,
what you doing?

04:01.041 --> 04:03.377
You want me to go get the kids'
new school clothes, right?

04:03.411 --> 04:06.314
Well, not unless you want me
to take off of work to do it.

04:06.347 --> 04:07.147
No, that's okay,

04:07.180 --> 04:08.716
but before I go
buying new stuff,

04:08.749 --> 04:10.351
I want to get rid of
the old stuff first.

04:10.384 --> 04:11.552
So I've got
two piles:

04:11.585 --> 04:14.054
Chris' stuff that
I'm getting rid of

04:14.087 --> 04:15.989
and Drew's stuff that
I'm giving to Chris.

04:16.023 --> 04:17.491
That's right there.

04:17.525 --> 04:20.828
I'm sure glad
Drew wasn't a girl.

04:20.861 --> 04:25.633
So you're buying something for
Drew and Tonya and not Chris?

04:25.666 --> 04:28.902
You want him working
on his Ph.D. in hand

04:28.936 --> 04:31.339
Drew barely wears something
before he grows out of it.

04:31.372 --> 04:32.773
I mean, his stuff
is almost new.

04:32.806 --> 04:34.775
Chris will be fine.

04:34.808 --> 04:36.744
My father was working
his scheme

04:36.777 --> 04:38.912
and the next day
I was getting worked over.

04:38.946 --> 04:41.615
What we're going to do is
the word association test.

04:41.649 --> 04:43.384
I'm going to say a word

04:43.417 --> 04:45.085
and I want you to say the
first thing that comes to mind.

04:45.118 --> 04:46.887
Brain.
Excuse me?

04:46.920 --> 04:49.323
Brain. You said "mind"
and I said "brain."

04:49.357 --> 04:50.958
Yeah, but we haven't
even started yet.

04:50.991 --> 04:52.360
Oh, sorry.

04:52.393 --> 04:53.427
Okay, let's start.

04:53.461 --> 04:55.396
School.
School.

04:55.429 --> 04:56.564
Teacher.
Teacher.

04:56.597 --> 04:59.066
Okay, I-I don't think
you understand this.

04:59.099 --> 05:01.335
I-I don't need you
to repeat what I say.

05:01.369 --> 05:03.737
I need you to say the first
thing that comes to mind.

05:03.771 --> 05:07.441
But what you say is the first
thing that comes to my mind.

05:07.475 --> 05:10.644
Well, I need you to say the
next thing that comes to mind.

05:10.678 --> 05:12.646
So the second thing?

05:12.680 --> 05:14.748
If the second thing
that comes to mind

05:14.782 --> 05:16.950
is the thing
that works in your mind,

05:16.984 --> 05:19.086
then let's do that thing.

05:19.119 --> 05:21.355
Okay, let's start.

05:21.389 --> 05:22.723
Father.
Tired.

05:22.756 --> 05:24.425
Mother.
Bald.

05:24.458 --> 05:25.959
Excuse me?

05:25.993 --> 05:27.761
Sorry. I was still on "father."

05:27.795 --> 05:29.763
Thank God.
I thought you had a bald mother.

05:29.797 --> 05:33.701
Okay, I'm going to make it
a little simpler for you.

05:33.734 --> 05:34.702
Slow.

05:34.735 --> 05:37.070
Fast.

05:37.104 --> 05:39.440
Dumb.
Sucker.

05:39.473 --> 05:40.441
Punk.

05:40.474 --> 05:41.575
Chump.

05:41.609 --> 05:43.611
Idiot.
Fool.

05:43.644 --> 05:44.612
Who?

05:44.645 --> 05:45.679
You.

05:45.713 --> 05:47.648
What?
Chicken-butt.

05:47.681 --> 05:48.849
Put it in a cup.

05:48.882 --> 05:51.118
Go around the corner
and lick it up.

05:53.153 --> 05:55.823
Oh, wait a minute.

05:55.856 --> 05:58.426
After going
to the guidance counselor,

05:58.459 --> 05:59.460
I really started to think

05:59.493 --> 06:01.795
about what I was going
to do with my life.

06:01.829 --> 06:02.630
Hey, Dad, how'd
you decide

06:02.663 --> 06:04.465
what you were gonna
do for a living?

06:04.498 --> 06:05.899
I applied for a bunch of jobs

06:05.933 --> 06:07.000
and I took every one
that hired me.

06:07.034 --> 06:09.169
And he would have kept them all
if he could have.

06:09.202 --> 06:11.405
Well, you won't have
to do that, baby.

06:11.439 --> 06:12.272
You're going to college.

06:12.305 --> 06:14.442
You'll be able to do
anything you want.

06:14.475 --> 06:15.909
Like get out of high school?

06:15.943 --> 06:17.611
Am I going to college, too?

06:17.645 --> 06:20.814
Yeah, you can be a professor
of ugly-ocity.
Shut up.

06:20.848 --> 06:23.016
Well, whatever you do,
make sure you like it,

06:23.050 --> 06:24.852
'cause once you have a family,

06:24.885 --> 06:26.454
that's what you're gonna
be doing

06:26.487 --> 06:28.756
for the rest of your life.

06:28.789 --> 06:29.757
ROCHELLE:
Wow.

06:29.790 --> 06:31.091
You make it sound so bad.

06:32.526 --> 06:35.028
So, Mom, how did you decide
what you were going to be?

06:35.062 --> 06:36.897
Well, when your father
decided that he wasn't going

06:36.930 --> 06:39.867
to be rich, I decided
to get a job.

06:39.900 --> 06:42.035
I didn't decide
I wasn't going to be rich.

06:42.069 --> 06:43.604
I didn't go to college.

06:43.637 --> 06:46.073
I drive a truck 'cause
that's what I know how to do.

06:46.106 --> 06:48.576
So you're saying you
don't like your life?

06:48.609 --> 06:49.376
I didn't say that.

06:49.409 --> 06:50.978
You know what, Julius?
Do you think

06:51.011 --> 06:52.846
you are the only one
that had a dream?

06:52.880 --> 06:53.881
Here we go.

06:53.914 --> 06:55.616
You know what, kids?
I had a dream.

06:55.649 --> 06:58.218
Every time I see
Shirley Chisholm, I think,

06:58.251 --> 07:00.020
"Wow, hey,
that could have been me."

07:00.921 --> 07:03.524
Yeah, I could have done
a lot of things.

07:05.125 --> 07:07.027
I could have won
a Pulitzer Prize.

07:07.060 --> 07:09.062
If she only learned
how to Pulitzer.

07:09.096 --> 07:10.998
I could have been
a Poet Laureate.

07:11.031 --> 07:12.165
That don't rhyme.

07:12.199 --> 07:15.035
You know what? I even could
have won a Cy Young Award.

07:15.068 --> 07:17.771
If she could only throw
a knuckleball.

07:17.805 --> 07:20.608
But instead I decided
to raise your family.

07:20.641 --> 07:21.675
My family?

07:21.709 --> 07:23.777
Now it's my family.

07:23.811 --> 07:25.078
That's right.

07:25.112 --> 07:26.780
Your family.

07:26.814 --> 07:28.281
And what thanks
do I get?

07:28.315 --> 07:32.219
:
Whatever you want to do, Chris,
just make sure you like it.

07:32.252 --> 07:33.253
That's what he said to you.

07:33.286 --> 07:35.589
I didn't mean it
like that.

07:35.623 --> 07:36.690
You know
what, Julius?

07:36.724 --> 07:38.826
I don't want to make
you any more unhappy

07:38.859 --> 07:41.762
than you already are.

07:41.795 --> 07:44.231
If he wasn't happy before,
it ain't changing no time soon.

07:44.264 --> 07:47.835
(door opens
and closes)

07:47.868 --> 07:50.571
My dad didn't go to college
and neither did my mother,

07:50.604 --> 07:53.006
so I tried to find out
if I knew anybody who did.

07:53.040 --> 07:55.543
Hey, Manny, did you
ever go to college?

07:55.576 --> 07:57.711
Always wanted to,
but I found out I couldn't.

07:57.745 --> 07:58.779
Why not?

07:58.812 --> 08:01.682
I had this thing called
"extenuating circumstances."

08:01.715 --> 08:03.584
Like what?
I never finished high school.

08:03.617 --> 08:06.019
So I got a job here
and when Manny died,

08:06.053 --> 08:07.621
I took over.

08:07.655 --> 08:09.690
Wait, you had the same
name as the owner?

08:09.723 --> 08:11.258
No, no, no,
my name was Lester.

08:11.291 --> 08:12.693
but I had to make a choice:

08:12.726 --> 08:14.695
change the sign
or change my name.

08:14.728 --> 08:16.096
And that sign was expensive.

08:16.129 --> 08:18.532
Hey, Kill Moves,
what did you want to do?

08:18.566 --> 08:19.933
I'm doing it.

08:19.967 --> 08:21.702
And if you study real hard,

08:21.735 --> 08:25.038
you, too, could be President
of the United States of America.

08:25.072 --> 08:27.641
Or crazy as hell.

08:28.576 --> 08:30.544
Hey, Mr. Abbott.

08:30.578 --> 08:32.913
How's it going, Chris?

08:32.946 --> 08:34.582
Well, I talked to a few people

08:34.615 --> 08:37.050
and I still don't know what
I want to do for a living,

08:37.084 --> 08:40.020
but I do know that my mom
wants me to go to college.

08:40.053 --> 08:41.755
College

08:41.789 --> 08:43.123
To learn?

08:43.156 --> 08:45.559
Learn? You can learn
anywhere, Chris.

08:45.593 --> 08:47.695
You can learn by reading
a fortune cookie.

08:47.728 --> 08:49.129
If you get hit
by a truck,

08:49.162 --> 08:51.599
you learn not to walk
out into traffic.

08:51.632 --> 08:53.000
If you smack Mike
Tyson, you learn

08:53.033 --> 08:55.002
that you are going to
get your ass whooped.

08:55.035 --> 08:56.837
But your
parents are

08:56.870 --> 09:01.041
way too broke for you to go
to college to just learn.

09:01.074 --> 09:03.143
They need you
to go to college

09:03.176 --> 09:05.178
and learn how
to get a job.

09:05.212 --> 09:07.681
Besides, I think
it's a little too early

09:07.715 --> 09:09.683
for you to be thinking
about college right now.

09:09.717 --> 09:11.118
And why is that?

09:11.151 --> 09:13.621
Well, according to
your test results,

09:13.654 --> 09:14.922
you have a lot of potential,

09:14.955 --> 09:16.790
but it's just going
to take time to develop.

09:16.824 --> 09:18.291
So what do we do now?

09:18.325 --> 09:20.861
I'm recommending that you
take remedial classes.

09:20.894 --> 09:22.362
Remedial class?!

09:22.395 --> 09:23.430
Remedial class.

09:23.463 --> 09:26.834
I can't go to remedial class.
You're going to go.

09:26.867 --> 09:28.736
How am I supposed
to tell my mama

09:28.769 --> 09:29.870
I'm going to remedial class?

09:29.903 --> 09:31.204
I'll write a note.

09:37.310 --> 09:38.879
So how'd it go
with the guidance counselor?

09:38.912 --> 09:40.981
He wants to put me
in remedial class.

09:41.014 --> 09:41.982
What?!

09:42.015 --> 09:42.783
How did that happen?

09:42.816 --> 09:44.652
Well, remember
that test we took?

09:44.685 --> 09:45.686
The one
they said didn't matter?

09:45.719 --> 09:47.354
Right. It mattered.

09:47.387 --> 09:49.690
The only thing worse
than getting put out of school

09:49.723 --> 09:52.392
was the thought of being put
in remedial class.

09:52.425 --> 09:54.227
* Round and round
Come on, Chris!

09:54.261 --> 09:57.698
* The wheels on the bus go
round and round *

09:57.731 --> 10:01.068
* All through the town.

10:03.436 --> 10:06.073
I guess it was a little bit
more serious than I thought.

10:06.106 --> 10:07.340
I got to see that guy, too.

10:07.374 --> 10:09.376
What for?
I don't know.

10:09.409 --> 10:11.645
Well, at least I live
too far away from school

10:11.679 --> 10:12.813
to ride the short bus.

10:12.846 --> 10:14.214
Actually,
you don't.

10:14.247 --> 10:16.850
City regulations allow for
special needs students pickups

10:16.884 --> 10:18.652
throughout
all school districts.

10:18.686 --> 10:20.821
Thanks.

10:25.258 --> 10:26.760
What's all this?

10:26.794 --> 10:29.229
The kids' new
school clothes.

10:29.262 --> 10:30.731
The Salvation Marines?

10:30.764 --> 10:33.166
You went shopping
at the thrift store?

10:33.200 --> 10:35.135
My father loved thrift stores

10:35.168 --> 10:37.637
'cause you could trade in
your old clothes...

10:39.239 --> 10:41.241
...for some new old clothes.

10:42.710 --> 10:45.746
My kids are not wearing
somebody else's old clothes.

10:45.779 --> 10:49.249
I mean, these pants
could've belonged to anybody.

10:49.282 --> 10:51.018
You act like the
pants are cursed.

10:51.051 --> 10:53.020
MAN:
Face forward.

10:53.053 --> 10:54.321
WOMAN:
That's him, officer.

10:54.354 --> 10:55.756
Are you sure?

10:55.789 --> 10:56.456
I know it's him.

10:56.489 --> 10:57.791
He's wearing those pants.

11:01.194 --> 11:03.931
Look, I can't afford to buy
all new school clothes.

11:03.964 --> 11:05.733
I guess
that's one more thing

11:05.766 --> 11:07.968
you can't stand
about your miserable life.

11:08.001 --> 11:09.469
My kids are not wearing these,

11:09.502 --> 11:12.305
so you either get
new clothes or new kids.

11:12.339 --> 11:14.942
He's trying to figure out
which one is cheaper.

11:14.975 --> 11:17.244
While my mother was throwing
clothes in the box,

11:17.277 --> 11:19.279
Greg was thinking
outside the box.

11:19.312 --> 11:21.181
You did unbelievable
on this test.

11:21.214 --> 11:23.450
There's a lot of things
you could do when you
get out of college.

11:23.483 --> 11:26.453
At first, I was
thinking I could start up
an investment banking firm,

11:26.486 --> 11:28.789
or maybe franchise
a coffee store.

11:28.822 --> 11:30.457
"Franchise a coffee store"?

11:30.490 --> 11:34.027
That is the dumbest idea
I've ever heard in my life.

11:34.061 --> 11:36.764
A store that sells
nothing but coffee?

11:36.797 --> 11:38.031
Well what you going
to open up next?

11:38.065 --> 11:39.466
A place that sells
nothing but staples?

11:39.499 --> 11:41.268
Oh, what's after that?

11:41.301 --> 11:43.737
A place that sells
everything for 99 cents?

11:47.274 --> 11:49.242
You smell anything?

11:49.276 --> 11:51.411
Well, see that's what
I was going to tell you.

11:51.444 --> 11:54.247
I settled on being an astronaut.

11:54.281 --> 11:55.949
I'm-I'm wearing a diaper.

11:55.983 --> 11:57.717
A diaper?!

11:58.819 --> 12:00.287
You mean, you want
to fly a rocket,

12:00.320 --> 12:02.489
but you're still gonna
pee in your pants?

12:02.522 --> 12:04.024
Well, they don't make you do it

12:04.057 --> 12:06.226
but I wanted to see
if I could take it.

12:06.259 --> 12:08.461
Nobody could take it, Greg.

12:08.495 --> 12:10.230
Now, get the funk
out of my office.

12:13.867 --> 12:15.268
Gah!

12:16.369 --> 12:18.839
Mr. Abbott?

12:18.872 --> 12:21.408
Chris. Can I help you?

12:21.441 --> 12:23.210
I'm not going
to remedial class.

12:23.243 --> 12:25.312
Chris, I'm just trying to do
what's best for you.

12:25.345 --> 12:27.047
If I would've known

12:27.080 --> 12:30.083
the test was that important,
I could've done better.

12:30.117 --> 12:32.820
If you could've done better,
you would've done better.

12:32.853 --> 12:34.021
Then let me take
the test again.

12:34.054 --> 12:35.856
It wouldn't even matter, Chris.

12:35.889 --> 12:37.457
It's already on your
permanent record.

12:37.490 --> 12:38.558
So you're telling me
that even though

12:38.591 --> 12:41.261
I've been passing classes
for the past two years,

12:41.294 --> 12:43.396
I do bad on one test,
and it's over?

12:43.430 --> 12:45.265
Hey, I don't make the rules.

12:45.298 --> 12:47.100
I just follow them.
Why?

12:47.134 --> 12:50.137
Hey, hey, hey, don't get
mad at me, short bus.

12:50.170 --> 12:53.440
You're the one that didn't
take this test serious.

12:53.473 --> 12:54.507
It's a test.

12:54.541 --> 12:56.877
What did you think
was gonna happen?

12:56.910 --> 12:59.479
You know what they do to food
before they give it to people?

12:59.512 --> 13:01.114
They test it.

13:01.148 --> 13:02.582
They don't even give people

13:02.615 --> 13:05.052
paper towels without
testing it first.

13:05.085 --> 13:06.286
How do you think they know

13:06.319 --> 13:08.221
that Bounty is
the quicker picker

13:08.255 --> 13:10.257
They test it, and you
know what happens

13:10.290 --> 13:13.426
to all the other paper towels
that couldn't sop up the grease?

13:13.460 --> 13:16.163
They fail and get sent back.

13:16.196 --> 13:18.065
Well, maybe if they would've
told the paper towel

13:18.098 --> 13:19.266
that he needed to
sop up the grease

13:19.299 --> 13:20.567
to get to the store,
he would've done better.

13:20.600 --> 13:23.203
What are you talking about?!

13:23.236 --> 13:25.605
I don't know. You started it.

13:25.638 --> 13:27.941
Okay, you want some help?

13:27.975 --> 13:30.443
Yeah.

13:30.477 --> 13:32.012
Let's go for a ride.

13:33.446 --> 13:35.248
What does this have to do
with me going to college?

13:35.282 --> 13:37.050
If you don't know what you
want to do with your life,

13:37.084 --> 13:40.220
it's all going to be a big waste
of time and money.

13:40.253 --> 13:43.056
Do you know how many
broke people went to college?

13:43.090 --> 13:45.458
Not really.

13:45.492 --> 13:47.427
Ladies and gentlemen,

13:47.460 --> 13:50.163
this young man here thinks
that all you have to do

13:50.197 --> 13:52.933
in life is go to college
and you'll be successful.

13:52.966 --> 13:55.335
By a show of hands, how
many of you went to college?

13:57.670 --> 14:00.107
We're on the wrong bus.

14:01.541 --> 14:05.112
Now by a show of hands, how many
of you people went to college?

14:06.379 --> 14:07.380
We're on the right bus.

14:07.414 --> 14:09.149
Now by another
show of hands,

14:09.182 --> 14:11.985
how many of you people right now

14:12.019 --> 14:15.455
wish you had that money
to pay some bills?

14:17.124 --> 14:18.525
Thank you.

14:22.996 --> 14:24.397
So what do I do?

14:24.431 --> 14:26.066
Well, I can't tell you that.

14:26.099 --> 14:28.135
But I'll tell you this,
you can't go to college

14:28.168 --> 14:30.370
just because your parents
will get mad if you don't.

14:30.403 --> 14:32.205
When you get out
of high school,

14:32.239 --> 14:34.107
take some time to
figure things out.

14:34.141 --> 14:36.376
Get a job, travel.

14:36.409 --> 14:38.078
Go find yourself.

14:45.652 --> 14:47.520
Hey, kid, you need a ride?

14:47.554 --> 14:49.389
Can I get on without a helmet?

14:49.422 --> 14:50.657
Come on.

14:53.360 --> 14:56.363
Good-bye, past.
Hello, future.

14:59.699 --> 15:02.302
After I got all my guidance,
my mother told the counselor

15:02.335 --> 15:04.337
where he could go.

15:08.976 --> 15:11.044
Still wearing that diaper, huh?

15:11.078 --> 15:13.146
After a while,
you don't notice.

15:13.180 --> 15:15.182
Right.

15:17.684 --> 15:19.319
So what are you
doing out here?

15:21.588 --> 15:24.024
My mom wasn't happy with the
guidance counselor's guidance.

15:24.057 --> 15:25.692
I know how she feels.

15:25.725 --> 15:28.195
The guy basically told me
I can do anything I want.

15:28.228 --> 15:29.496
That's pressure.

15:29.529 --> 15:33.133
It's like, even if I wanted
to fail, I couldn't.

15:33.166 --> 15:34.667
That was the moment I realized

15:34.701 --> 15:36.669
what it truly meant
to be white.

15:36.703 --> 15:38.238
Must be tough.

15:40.307 --> 15:42.209
I'm sorry, but it's all right
there in the test.

15:42.242 --> 15:44.277
Tests, tests-- you keep
talking about tests.

15:44.311 --> 15:46.546
I'm here to talk about my son.

15:46.579 --> 15:48.181
I mean, what does
a test prove anyway?

15:48.215 --> 15:49.716
Charles Manson
passed some tests.

15:49.749 --> 15:53.320
I'm not saying there's
anything wrong with your son.

15:53.353 --> 15:55.755
Well, I'm saying that there's
something wrong with you.

15:55.788 --> 15:58.125
You're supposed to be
a guidance counselor.

15:58.158 --> 15:59.726
Guide.

15:59.759 --> 16:01.228
I did the best I could.

16:01.261 --> 16:03.130
No, you didn't.

16:03.163 --> 16:05.165
"Go find yourself."
What is that?

16:05.198 --> 16:06.766
I'm not trying to hold
your son back.

16:06.799 --> 16:09.669
But going to college without
knowing what you want to study

16:09.702 --> 16:11.571
is kind of like going
to a grocery store

16:11.604 --> 16:12.639
without knowing
what you want to eat.

16:12.672 --> 16:15.575
And telling a boy to figure out
what he wants to do

16:15.608 --> 16:17.144
by telling him to do nothing

16:17.177 --> 16:19.412
is like telling him to learn
how to swim by drowning.

16:19.446 --> 16:21.148
What are you talking about?

16:21.181 --> 16:23.150
I don't know,
but you started it.

16:23.183 --> 16:24.517
Thanks for coming.

16:24.551 --> 16:25.785
You're more than welcome.
Nice meeting you.

16:25.818 --> 16:26.853
Pleasure.

16:26.886 --> 16:30.357
Anyways, I can't wait
for this interview to be over,

16:30.390 --> 16:31.791
so I can put more
baby powder on.

16:31.824 --> 16:34.327
MR. ABBOTT:
I know you want
what's bet for your son,

16:34.361 --> 16:36.163
but I think he's
going to be okay.

16:36.196 --> 16:38.298
Thank you very much.

16:41.134 --> 16:42.469
What the hell is that smell?

16:42.502 --> 16:46.106
Greg, is that you, boy?

16:46.139 --> 16:47.474
I'm studying to be
an astronaut.

16:47.507 --> 16:49.042
Well, even astronauts
wash their...

16:49.076 --> 16:50.143
CHRIS:
Come on, Ma.

16:50.177 --> 16:52.379
My God!

16:54.681 --> 16:57.617
Nope, nope, nope.
Get out of here, Funky Brewster.

16:57.650 --> 16:59.552
Every day of my life,
my mother threatened

16:59.586 --> 17:03.523
to knock the lobes off my ears
or slap the pores off my face,

17:03.556 --> 17:05.392
but if anybody else
ever put me down,

17:05.425 --> 17:07.727
she was always there
to pick me back up.

17:07.760 --> 17:09.829
Look, Chris, I don't know
what you're going to do
with your life.

17:09.862 --> 17:11.564
You may go to college,
you may not.

17:11.598 --> 17:14.167
But I know whatever you do,
you're going to be good at it.

17:14.201 --> 17:16.803
'Cause I ain't having no grown
man sleeping in my house.

17:16.836 --> 17:18.271
Yes, ma'am.

17:19.539 --> 17:20.407
So, how'd things go?

17:20.440 --> 17:22.242
Did you figure out
what you want to do?

17:22.275 --> 17:25.378
Not really,
but I'll be all right.

17:25.412 --> 17:29.082
If I can't figure out what
I want to do, at least I can
be a guidance counselor.

17:29.116 --> 17:31.251
I mean, all you do
is ask people questions

17:31.284 --> 17:32.385
that you don't even
know the answer to,

17:32.419 --> 17:34.421
and you tell them
to take a hike.

17:34.454 --> 17:36.189
I mean, I may not be the
smartest person in the world,

17:36.223 --> 17:37.824
but I think I'm smart enough
to do that.

17:37.857 --> 17:41.294
MR. ABBOTT:
Is that all you think I do?

17:41.328 --> 17:43.663
Even in a diaper,
Greg could run like the wind.

17:43.696 --> 17:45.132
The smelly wind.

17:45.165 --> 17:46.099
Am I wrong?

17:46.133 --> 17:48.568
Listen here, short bus,
I work for the school.

17:48.601 --> 17:50.570
I deal with the tests, okay?

17:50.603 --> 17:52.139
You know, when I was your age,

17:52.172 --> 17:54.407
I took these tests, too,
and I did great.

17:54.441 --> 17:57.310
Do you think I thought
I was going to just be
a guidance counselor?

17:57.344 --> 17:58.811
What did you want to do?

17:58.845 --> 18:03.550
What I wanted to do
required bravery...

18:03.583 --> 18:06.353
dedication, commitment.

18:06.386 --> 18:08.488
I wanted to serve the people.

18:08.521 --> 18:10.890
So you wanted to be a Marine?

18:10.923 --> 18:12.692
Not exactly.

18:21.368 --> 18:24.137
Anyway, it's not too late
for me,

18:24.171 --> 18:26.273
and it's not too late for you.

18:26.306 --> 18:28.308
Good luck.

18:31.778 --> 18:33.546
Hey, Ma, come look!

18:36.416 --> 18:37.884
Aren't these jeans cool?

18:37.917 --> 18:40.320
Baby, those are adorable.

18:40.353 --> 18:41.888
Hey, Chris.

18:41.921 --> 18:43.156
So how'd it go at school today?

18:43.190 --> 18:45.292
Fine.

18:46.426 --> 18:47.260
Fine.

18:47.294 --> 18:49.462
Daddy let us pick out
our own clothes.

18:49.496 --> 18:51.598
Well, hopefully you picked out
something you liked.

18:51.631 --> 18:53.500
I mean, heaven forbid
you wake up one day

18:53.533 --> 18:54.667
and realize you can't stand it.

18:56.769 --> 18:57.904
Rochelle, stop it.

18:57.937 --> 18:59.206
Okay, just stop it.

18:59.239 --> 19:00.740
What? What are you
talking about?

19:00.773 --> 19:02.909
Rochelle, the reason

19:02.942 --> 19:04.344
I said those things to Chris

19:04.377 --> 19:06.279
is because nobody said
those things to me.

19:06.313 --> 19:08.615
You're the best thing
that ever happened to me.

19:08.648 --> 19:11.451
And, yeah, I mean, I
don't get a lot of sleep,

19:11.484 --> 19:13.653
and I don't make a lot
of money, but I've got you.

19:13.686 --> 19:15.622
I've got my kids,

19:15.655 --> 19:17.690
and that's all I need.

19:17.724 --> 19:21.228
At that moment, I didn't have
any idea what I wanted to do,

19:21.261 --> 19:23.396
but what I wanted to be
was just like my father.

19:23.430 --> 19:26.766
Where the hell you get that,
from the inside of a card?

19:26.799 --> 19:27.900
Peabo Bryson song.

19:27.934 --> 19:29.202
That's how I feel.

19:29.236 --> 19:30.537
Then why didn't
you just say that?

19:30.570 --> 19:31.838
I just said it.

19:31.871 --> 19:33.840
Why didn't you say it
in the first place?

19:36.409 --> 19:38.411
Hey, Chris, I got
you something.

19:39.712 --> 19:41.748
Air Jordans?!

19:41.781 --> 19:42.949
These cost a fortune.

19:42.982 --> 19:44.517
Oh, not these.

19:44.551 --> 19:45.918
Let's just say
I got a deal.

19:45.952 --> 19:47.920
Uh-oh.

19:47.954 --> 19:50.523
Even though I wasn't sure what
I was going to do with my life,

19:50.557 --> 19:52.992
I knew one thing for sure:
my mother and father

19:53.025 --> 19:54.927
were always going
to look out for me.

19:54.961 --> 19:56.529
The only feeling
better than that

19:56.563 --> 19:58.331
was having a brand-new
pair of shoes.

19:58.365 --> 20:00.233
:
That's him!
Are you sure?

20:00.267 --> 20:02.502
I'm positive!
He's wearing those shoes.

20:05.405 --> 20:07.274
Daddy! Daddy!

20:07.307 --> 20:11.210
* Everybody hates Chris.

20:15.348 --> 20:19.519
