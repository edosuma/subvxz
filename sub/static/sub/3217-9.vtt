00:02.377 --> 00:04.378
Dad wants us to pick up
where he left off.

00:04.587 --> 00:08.048
Saving people, hunting things.
The family business.

00:10.343 --> 00:12.803
You know the truth about Sammy?

00:14.055 --> 00:15.347
I've known for a while.

00:15.557 --> 00:18.600
You get premonitions of people
about to die?

00:19.853 --> 00:21.061
- Death visions?
- Yeah.

00:22.939 --> 00:25.274
The demon said he had plans for me.

00:25.483 --> 00:27.609
- Do you have any idea what he meant?
- No.

00:27.819 --> 00:29.987
I want you to watch out
for Sammy, okay?

00:32.490 --> 00:33.824
Did he say anything to you?

00:34.909 --> 00:35.951
No.

00:37.370 --> 00:40.664
Can't talk about this to Sammy.
Gotta keep my game face on.

00:40.874 --> 00:42.583
You're on edge. You're erratic.

00:42.792 --> 00:45.627
Except for when you're hunting,
then you're downright scary.

00:46.421 --> 00:48.589
The truth is
I'm not handling it very well.

00:49.799 --> 00:53.510
You're tailspinning, man.
And you won't let me help you.

00:55.000 --> 01:01.074

01:23.041 --> 01:25.292
No, no, no. You're not gonna...

01:25.502 --> 01:27.961
No, I swear, it's not in me.

01:28.171 --> 01:30.506
Oh, God. We're all gonna die.

01:30.715 --> 01:33.467
- Maybe he's telling the truth.
- He's not him, not anymore.

01:33.635 --> 01:36.637
No, stop. Stop it!
Ask her! Ask the doctor!

01:36.846 --> 01:39.765
- It's not in me!
- I just...

01:41.267 --> 01:42.309
I can't tell.

01:42.519 --> 01:44.770
No, please. Don't, don't.

01:45.438 --> 01:47.106
- I swear, I swear.
- I got no choice.

01:47.273 --> 01:50.150
It's not in me. It's not in me.

01:53.404 --> 01:55.280
Don't. Don't.

01:56.616 --> 01:58.575
Please.

02:12.173 --> 02:13.674
Sam?

02:28.523 --> 02:31.984
Continue on OR-224 west.

02:32.193 --> 02:34.528
There are two towns in the U.S.
named Rivergrove.

02:34.737 --> 02:37.156
How come you're so sure
it's the one in Oregon?

02:40.410 --> 02:43.912
There was a picture of Crater Lake.

02:44.122 --> 02:45.414
Okay, what else?

02:45.832 --> 02:50.586
I saw a dark room, some people,
and a guy tied to a chair.

02:50.920 --> 02:52.421
And I ventilated him?

02:53.339 --> 02:54.673
Yeah.

02:54.924 --> 02:56.925
You thought
there was something inside him.

02:57.093 --> 02:59.094
- A demon? Was he possessed?
- I don't know.

02:59.262 --> 03:01.930
All your visions are tied
to the yellow-eyed demon.

03:02.098 --> 03:04.683
Was there any black smoke?
Did we try to exorcise him?

03:04.851 --> 03:08.645
No, nothing.
You just plugged him. That's it.

03:08.855 --> 03:10.439
I'm sure I had a good reason.

03:11.232 --> 03:12.441
I sure hope so.

03:14.110 --> 03:15.235
What does that mean?

03:18.072 --> 03:20.199
I mean, I'm not gonna waste
an innocent man.

03:21.659 --> 03:23.160
- I wouldn't.
- Never said you would.

03:23.328 --> 03:24.536
- Fine.
- Fine.

03:24.996 --> 03:27.206
We don't know what it is,
but whatever it is...

03:27.373 --> 03:30.876
...that guy in the chair is part of it.
Let's find him, see what's what.

03:31.085 --> 03:32.502
- Fine.
- Fine.

04:16.464 --> 04:17.505
He was there.

04:21.678 --> 04:23.470
- Morning.
- Morning.

04:23.680 --> 04:25.347
- Can I help you?
- Yeah.

04:25.556 --> 04:28.850
Billy Gibbons, Frank Beard.
U.S. Marshals.

04:29.560 --> 04:31.770
- What's this about?
- We're looking for someone.

04:31.938 --> 04:34.523
A young man, early 20s.

04:34.941 --> 04:39.444
He'd have a thin scar
right below his hairline.

04:40.571 --> 04:41.989
- What'd he do?
- Well, nothing.

04:42.156 --> 04:45.284
We're looking for someone else.
We think this young man can help.

04:45.451 --> 04:47.869
He's not in any trouble or anything.
Well, not yet.

04:52.041 --> 04:55.252
I think maybe you know
who he is, master sergeant.

04:56.879 --> 04:58.463
My dad was in the Corps.
A corporal.

04:58.715 --> 05:00.757
- What company?
- Echo 21.

05:01.134 --> 05:02.217
So can you help us?

05:06.973 --> 05:09.766
Duane Tanner's got a scar like that.

05:09.934 --> 05:12.686
But I know him.
Good kid, keeps his nose clean.

05:12.895 --> 05:15.564
Oh, I'm sure he does.
Do you know where he lives?

05:16.441 --> 05:20.068
With his family, up Aspen Way.

05:20.945 --> 05:22.529
Thank you.

05:36.252 --> 05:37.836
Hey.

05:45.720 --> 05:48.096
"Croatoan"?
- Yeah.

05:49.390 --> 05:52.267
Roanoke? Lost colony? Ring a bell?

05:52.643 --> 05:55.604
Dean, did you pay
any attention in history class?

05:56.064 --> 06:00.525
Yeah. The shot heard around the world,
how bills become laws.

06:00.777 --> 06:03.695
That's not school.
That's Schoolhouse Rock!

06:05.448 --> 06:06.865
Whatever.

06:07.241 --> 06:10.827
Roanoke was one of the first
English colonies in America, late 1500s.

06:11.662 --> 06:13.747
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah,
I do remember that.

06:13.956 --> 06:17.209
The only thing they left behind
was a single word carved in a tree.

06:17.668 --> 06:19.127
- Croatoan.
- Yeah.

06:19.295 --> 06:22.089
And, I mean, there were theories,
Indian raid, disease.

06:22.256 --> 06:25.092
Nobody knows what really happened.
They were all just gone.

06:25.259 --> 06:26.760
I mean, wiped out overnight.

06:28.012 --> 06:30.722
You don't think that's what's
going on here? I mean...

06:31.140 --> 06:33.975
Whatever I saw in my head,
it sure wasn't good.

06:35.812 --> 06:38.438
But what do you think could do that?

06:41.275 --> 06:44.319
Well, I mean, like I said,
all your weirdo visions...

06:44.487 --> 06:47.572
...are always tied to
the yellow-eyed demon somehow, so...

06:47.740 --> 06:51.701
We should get help.
Bobby, Ellen, maybe.

06:51.911 --> 06:53.745
Yeah, that's a good idea.

06:59.502 --> 07:01.253
I don't have a signal.

07:07.301 --> 07:09.094
I don't either.

07:19.647 --> 07:21.606
Line's dead.

07:23.067 --> 07:24.401
I'll tell you one thing.

07:24.569 --> 07:28.488
If I was gonna massacre a town,
that'd be my first step.

07:47.175 --> 07:48.884
- Yeah?
- Hi.

07:49.051 --> 07:51.303
Looking for Duane Tanner.
He lives here, right?

07:51.471 --> 07:54.306
- He's my brother.
Can we talk to him?

07:54.974 --> 07:57.601
- He's not here right now.
- You know where he is?

07:57.935 --> 08:00.812
Yeah. He went on a fishing trip
up by Roslyn Lake.

08:01.022 --> 08:03.023
- Your parents home?
- Yeah, they're inside.

08:03.191 --> 08:05.025
Jake, who is it?

08:07.570 --> 08:10.113
U.S. Marshals, sir.
We're looking for your son Duane.

08:10.281 --> 08:11.823
Why? He's not in trouble, is he?

08:11.991 --> 08:14.618
No. We just need to ask him
a couple routine questions.

08:14.827 --> 08:17.329
When's he due back from his trip?

08:18.122 --> 08:21.541
- I'm not sure.
- Well, maybe your wife knows.

08:21.751 --> 08:24.085
You know, I don't know.
She's not here right now.

08:24.253 --> 08:26.254
Well, your son said she was.

08:26.422 --> 08:29.341
- Did I?
- She's getting groceries.

08:29.926 --> 08:32.802
When Duane gets back,
there's a number where he can get you?

08:32.970 --> 08:35.804
Oh, no,
we'll just check in with you later.

08:42.313 --> 08:44.063
That was kind of creepy, right?

08:44.232 --> 08:47.234
- Little too Stepford?
- Bigtime.

08:57.620 --> 09:01.498
It's okay, Mom. It's not gonna hurt.

09:21.852 --> 09:23.103
- No!
- Put it down.

10:03.477 --> 10:05.270
Hello?

10:05.688 --> 10:07.480
Hello, we need a doctor here.

10:09.650 --> 10:11.276
Mrs. Tanner, what happened?

10:11.485 --> 10:13.486
- She's been attacked.
- Dr. Lee?

10:17.033 --> 10:18.283
It's okay.

10:18.534 --> 10:20.910
- Bring her in.
- Okay.

10:23.581 --> 10:25.582
Okay.
- Hey.

10:26.375 --> 10:27.834
Is that...?

10:28.544 --> 10:29.878
Mr. Tanner?

10:30.212 --> 10:31.880
Was he attacked too?

10:32.923 --> 10:36.009
No, actually, he did the attacking
and then he got himself shot.

10:36.218 --> 10:37.385
- Shot?
- Yeah.

10:37.678 --> 10:39.554
- And who are you?
- U.S. Marshal.

10:40.056 --> 10:41.723
I'd show you my badge, but...

10:42.058 --> 10:44.392
Oh, sorry. Bring him back here.

10:46.604 --> 10:48.688
Wait, you said Jake helped him?

10:49.065 --> 10:50.523
Your son Jake?

10:51.901 --> 10:53.568
They beat me.

10:55.112 --> 10:56.404
Tied me up.

10:58.115 --> 11:00.700
- I don't believe it.
Pam.

11:00.910 --> 11:04.746
Beverly, you have any idea
why they would act this way?

11:04.914 --> 11:08.750
- Any history of chemical dependency?
No, of course not.

11:09.126 --> 11:10.752
I don't know why.

11:11.921 --> 11:15.423
One minute,
they were my husband and my son...

11:16.258 --> 11:19.761
...and the next,
they had the devil in them.

11:23.057 --> 11:24.766
We gotta talk.

11:30.773 --> 11:32.732
Those guys were whacked out
of their gourds.

11:32.900 --> 11:35.610
What do you think?
Multiple demons, mass possession?

11:35.778 --> 11:38.780
If it's a possession, there could be more.
God knows how many.

11:38.948 --> 11:41.282
It could be like a frigging
Shriner convention.

11:42.243 --> 11:44.244
- Great.
- That's one way to wipe out a town.

11:44.412 --> 11:45.954
- Take it from the inside.
- I don't know.

11:46.288 --> 11:49.416
We didn't see any demon smoke
or any of the other usual signs.

11:49.583 --> 11:52.460
Well, whatever.
Something turned him into a monster.

11:53.587 --> 11:56.965
If you'd taken out the other one,
there'd be one less to worry about.

11:57.133 --> 11:59.926
I'm sorry, all right?
I hesitated, Dean. It was a kid.

12:00.094 --> 12:01.428
No, it was an it.

12:01.804 --> 12:03.680
Not the best time
for a bleeding heart, Sam.

12:05.516 --> 12:06.933
- How's the patient?
- Terrible.

12:07.101 --> 12:08.977
- What the hell happened?
- We don't know.

12:09.145 --> 12:11.646
- You just killed my neighbor.
- Didn't have a choice.

12:11.814 --> 12:14.524
Maybe, but we need
the county sheriff. I need the coroner.

12:14.692 --> 12:16.693
- Phones are down.
- I know, I tried.

12:16.902 --> 12:18.778
- Tell me you got a police radio.
- We do.

12:18.946 --> 12:20.989
But it crapped out,
like everything else.

12:21.532 --> 12:22.991
I don't understand.

12:23.159 --> 12:26.161
- How far to the next town?
- About 40 miles down to Sidewinder.

12:26.328 --> 12:28.621
I'll go there
and see if I can find some help.

12:28.831 --> 12:31.916
My partner will stick around,
keep you guys safe.

12:32.543 --> 12:33.668
Safe from what?

12:35.838 --> 12:37.922
We'll get back to you on that.

14:00.923 --> 14:02.048
Huh.

14:04.260 --> 14:05.927
What?

14:06.262 --> 14:08.721
His lymphocyte percentage
is pretty high.

14:08.931 --> 14:11.057
His body was fighting off
a viral infection.

14:11.267 --> 14:14.769
- Really? What kind of virus?
- Can't say for sure.

14:14.937 --> 14:17.313
Think an infection could've
made him act like that?

14:17.523 --> 14:18.898
None that I've ever heard of.

14:19.066 --> 14:21.943
Some can cause dementia,
but not that kind of violence.

14:22.111 --> 14:25.280
Besides, I've never heard of one
that did this to the blood.

14:25.447 --> 14:27.949
- Did what?
- There's this weird residue.

14:29.159 --> 14:32.412
If I didn't know better,
I'd say it was sulfur.

14:39.253 --> 14:40.628
Sulfur.

15:14.663 --> 15:17.874
- Oh. Hey.
- Sorry, road's closed.

15:18.125 --> 15:20.668
Yeah, I can see that. What's up?

15:20.878 --> 15:22.503
- Quarantine.
- Quarantine?

15:22.880 --> 15:25.465
- What is it?
- Don't know.

15:25.674 --> 15:27.842
Something going around out there.

15:28.010 --> 15:29.886
- Who told you that?
- County sheriff.

15:30.387 --> 15:33.806
- Is he here?
- No. He called.

15:34.683 --> 15:37.685
Say, why don't you get out of the car
and we'll talk a little?

15:38.228 --> 15:41.856
Oh, you're a handsome devil,
but I don't swing that way, sorry.

15:42.399 --> 15:46.027
I'd sure appreciate it if you got out
of the car, just for a quick minute.

15:47.863 --> 15:49.739
Yeah, I bet you would.

16:09.218 --> 16:11.010
I don't understand.

16:11.220 --> 16:15.932
Are you saying my husband
and Jake had a disease?

16:16.183 --> 16:18.184
That's what we're trying
to find out.

16:18.352 --> 16:21.562
Now, during the attack,
do you remember...

16:22.398 --> 16:25.400
...did you have any direct contact
with their blood?

16:25.651 --> 16:26.693
Oh, my God.

16:27.403 --> 16:30.071
You don't think
I've got this virus, do you?

16:30.906 --> 16:32.949
Beverly, I don't know what to think.

16:33.200 --> 16:35.910
But with your permission,
we'll take a blood sample.

17:08.234 --> 17:10.486
- Hands where I can see them!
- Son of a--

17:10.738 --> 17:12.446
Get out of the car!

17:13.949 --> 17:14.991
Out of the car!

17:18.328 --> 17:20.329
All right, easy there, big guy.

17:23.416 --> 17:25.835
- Put it down! Down!
- Lower it now! You one of them?

17:26.002 --> 17:27.462
- No, you? Could be lying.
- No.

17:27.628 --> 17:29.422
- So could you.
- All right. All right.

17:31.091 --> 17:35.219
We could do this all day, all right? Let's
take it easy before we kill each other.

17:38.098 --> 17:40.433
- What's going on with everybody?
- I don't know.

17:40.642 --> 17:42.518
My neighbor, Mr. Rogers...

17:42.853 --> 17:45.772
- You got a neighbor named Mr. Rogers?
- Not anymore.

17:47.149 --> 17:50.651
He came at me with a hatchet.
I put him down.

17:51.153 --> 17:53.696
He's not the only one.
It's happening to everyone.

17:53.864 --> 17:56.365
I'm heading to doc's place.
There's some people left.

17:56.533 --> 17:58.326
- I'm getting out.
- There's no way out.

17:58.494 --> 17:59.744
They got the bridge.

17:59.953 --> 18:02.955
- I don't believe you.
- Fine, stay here. Be my guest.

18:19.306 --> 18:22.058
Well, this ought to be a relaxing drive.

18:28.357 --> 18:30.566
What if we all have it?

18:31.318 --> 18:34.195
- What if we all go crazy?
- You've gotta stay calm.

18:34.363 --> 18:37.031
All we can do is wait.
The marshal's bringing help.

18:37.366 --> 18:38.783
I can't, I...

18:38.992 --> 18:41.035
No, I've gotta go.

18:41.203 --> 18:43.037
Pam.
No, you don't understand.

18:43.205 --> 18:46.082
My boyfriend's out there.
I gotta make sure he's okay.

18:50.879 --> 18:53.881
Hey, hey, wait. Wait, please.

18:55.008 --> 18:58.719
I know you're upset, all right?
But it's safer if you stay here for now.

18:59.054 --> 19:00.721
Help is coming.

19:05.936 --> 19:07.812
There they are.

19:08.730 --> 19:11.065
Sammy! Open up!

19:18.198 --> 19:21.617
Did you guys get to a phone?
Roadblock.

19:21.869 --> 19:25.121
- I'm gonna have a word. Doc's inside.
- All right.

19:26.081 --> 19:27.373
What's going on out there?

19:27.916 --> 19:30.585
I don't know. I feel like
Chuck Heston in The Omega Man.

19:30.752 --> 19:32.420
The sarge is the only sane person.

19:32.629 --> 19:35.923
- What are we dealing with? You know?
- Yeah, doc thinks it's a virus.

19:36.091 --> 19:38.843
- Okay, great. What do you think?
- I think she's right.

19:39.052 --> 19:40.386
- Really?
- Yeah.

19:40.554 --> 19:43.431
The infected are trying to infect others
with blood-to-blood contact.

19:43.599 --> 19:46.893
It gets better. The virus leaves
traces of sulfur in the blood.

19:47.144 --> 19:49.937
- A demonic virus?
- Yeah, more like demonic germ warfare.

19:50.981 --> 19:53.566
At least it explains
why I've been having visions.

19:53.984 --> 19:56.903
- It's like a Biblical plague.
- Yeah.

19:57.112 --> 19:59.280
You don't know
how right you are, Dean.

19:59.448 --> 20:01.407
I've been poring
through Dad's journal.

20:01.575 --> 20:03.451
Found something
about the Roanoke colony.

20:03.660 --> 20:05.995
- And?
- Dad had a theory about Croatoan.

20:06.163 --> 20:09.415
He thought it was a demon's name,
known as Dever or Reshef.

20:09.791 --> 20:11.959
A demon of plague and pestilence.

20:12.127 --> 20:14.754
Well, that's terrific.
Why here? Why now?

20:14.963 --> 20:16.130
I have no idea.

20:17.466 --> 20:20.635
But, Dean, I mean, who knows
how far this thing can spread.

20:20.802 --> 20:23.012
We gotta get out of here.
We gotta warn people.

20:23.180 --> 20:24.972
They've got one. In here.

20:28.310 --> 20:30.519
What do you mean?
The wife. She's infected.

20:30.687 --> 20:33.397
We gotta take care of this.
We can't leave her in there.

20:33.607 --> 20:35.191
My neighbors, they were strong.

20:35.442 --> 20:37.526
The longer we wait,
the stronger she'll get.

20:44.117 --> 20:46.327
You're gonna kill Beverly Tanner.

20:46.536 --> 20:50.498
Doctor, could there be any treatment?
Some kind of cure for this?

20:52.834 --> 20:55.836
- Can you cure it?
- I don't even know what it is.

20:56.046 --> 20:57.797
I told you, it's a matter of time.

20:58.006 --> 21:00.675
Just leave her there.
You can't shoot her like an animal.

21:00.926 --> 21:02.468
Sam.

21:22.030 --> 21:24.657
Mark. What are you doing?

21:25.534 --> 21:28.077
Mark, it's them.

21:28.328 --> 21:31.539
They locked me in here.
They tried to kill me.

21:31.707 --> 21:33.666
They're infected, not me.

21:34.209 --> 21:36.585
Please, Mark.

21:36.837 --> 21:41.215
You've known me all your life. Please.

21:42.551 --> 21:44.719
You're sure she's one of them?

21:46.888 --> 21:48.597
Yeah.

22:42.319 --> 22:44.445
Ah! Oh, God. Is there any on me?

22:44.654 --> 22:46.781
- Am I okay?
- You're clean. You're okay.

22:46.948 --> 22:49.158
Why are we staying here?
Please, let's just go.

22:49.368 --> 22:51.369
No, we can't,
those things are everywhere.

22:51.787 --> 22:52.787
Oh, God.

22:53.705 --> 22:55.623
Shh, shh, shh.

22:59.086 --> 23:01.796
She's right about one thing.
We can't stay here.

23:02.005 --> 23:04.340
We gotta get out,
to the roadhouse or somewhere.

23:04.549 --> 23:07.051
- Let people know what's coming.
- That's a good point.

23:07.219 --> 23:09.220
Night of the Living Dead
didn't end pretty.

23:09.429 --> 23:12.640
I'm not sure we got a choice.
Folks up here are good with rifles.

23:12.849 --> 23:15.309
Even with all your hardware,
we're easy targets.

23:15.477 --> 23:17.311
So unless you got some explosives...

23:24.945 --> 23:26.070
We could make some.

23:31.493 --> 23:34.453
Hey! Let me in! Let me in, please!

23:35.330 --> 23:37.331
It's Duane Tanner.

23:41.461 --> 23:43.504
Oh, thank God.

23:48.718 --> 23:50.636
Duane, you okay?

23:52.347 --> 23:54.890
- That's the guy that I:
- Yeah.

23:55.267 --> 23:56.684
Who else is in here?

23:56.852 --> 23:58.686
Hey, whoa, whoa, easy there, chief.

23:58.895 --> 24:02.148
Hey, doc, give Duane
a good once-over, would you?

24:04.443 --> 24:06.193
Pam?

24:07.446 --> 24:09.113
- Who are you?
- Never mind who I am.

24:09.281 --> 24:11.699
- Doc?
- Yeah, okay.

24:11.908 --> 24:14.034
Duane, where you been?

24:14.786 --> 24:18.664
I was on a fishing trip up by Roslyn.
I came back this afternoon.

24:18.874 --> 24:22.251
I saw Roger McGill being dragged out
of his house by people we know.

24:22.461 --> 24:24.712
They started cutting him with knives.

24:24.921 --> 24:27.214
I ran. I've been hiding in the woods
ever since.

24:27.382 --> 24:29.300
Has anybody seen my mom and dad?

24:30.218 --> 24:32.553
Awkward.

24:35.974 --> 24:37.016
You're bleeding.

24:39.436 --> 24:42.229
- Where'd you get that?
- I was running. I must've tripped.

24:43.732 --> 24:45.232
Tie him up. There's rope there.

24:45.442 --> 24:46.901
- Wait--
- Sit down!

24:48.278 --> 24:50.988
Sorry, Duane. He's right.
We gotta be careful.

24:51.323 --> 24:53.199
Careful? About what?

24:53.408 --> 24:55.993
- Did they bleed on you?
- No. What the hell--? No!

24:56.203 --> 24:58.996
Doc? Any way to know for sure?
Any test?

24:59.206 --> 25:03.042
- I've studied Beverly's blood work.
- My mom?

25:03.210 --> 25:05.753
It took three hours
for the virus to incubate.

25:05.962 --> 25:08.422
The sulfur didn't appear
in the blood until then.

25:08.590 --> 25:10.174
No, there'd be no way of knowing.

25:10.926 --> 25:14.053
Not until after Duane turns.

25:14.262 --> 25:17.598
Dean, I gotta talk to you. Now.

25:20.268 --> 25:21.685
Sit in that chair over there.

25:24.940 --> 25:26.774
This is my vision, Dean.

25:26.983 --> 25:28.943
- It's happening.
- Yeah, I figured.

25:29.110 --> 25:32.321
You can't kill him. Not yet.
We don't know if he's infected or not.

25:32.489 --> 25:33.656
I think we're damn sure.

25:33.823 --> 25:37.159
Guy shows up out of nowhere.
Got a cut, his whole family's infected.

25:37.327 --> 25:39.411
We should keep him tied up
and wait and see.

25:39.579 --> 25:42.164
For what? For him to hulk out?
Infect somebody else?

25:42.332 --> 25:45.084
No, thanks, can't take that chance.

25:45.961 --> 25:48.754
I'm not happy about this.
It's a tough job. You know that.

25:48.964 --> 25:51.715
It's supposed to be tough.
We're supposed to struggle.

25:51.883 --> 25:53.801
- That's the point.
- What does it buy us?

25:53.969 --> 25:57.304
- A clear conscience, for one.
- Well, it's too late for that.

25:57.472 --> 25:59.265
- What's happened to you?
- What?

25:59.474 --> 26:02.101
You might kill an innocent man
and you don't even care.

26:02.269 --> 26:03.936
You don't act
like yourself anymore.

26:04.104 --> 26:07.273
You know what? You're acting like
one of those things out there.

26:10.860 --> 26:11.986
Hey.

26:12.487 --> 26:13.571
Hey.

26:13.989 --> 26:17.032
Open the damn door. Dean.

26:18.326 --> 26:21.328
Don't do it, Dean! Don't.

26:29.921 --> 26:32.506
No, no, no. You're not gonna...

26:34.259 --> 26:37.011
No, no, I swear, it's not in me.

26:37.220 --> 26:38.846
Oh, God. We're all gonna die.

26:39.055 --> 26:40.431
Maybe he's telling the truth.

26:40.807 --> 26:43.058
- No, he's not him, not anymore.
Stop, stop it!

26:43.268 --> 26:46.687
Ask her. Ask the doctor.
It's not in me!

26:51.151 --> 26:52.192
I can't tell.

26:54.946 --> 26:56.530
Please, don't.

26:57.032 --> 27:01.744
Don't, please. I swear, it's not in me.
It's not in me, I swear.

27:01.953 --> 27:05.831
I swear, it's not in me. Don't. Don't.

27:06.041 --> 27:07.458
I got no choice.

27:09.044 --> 27:10.461
No.

27:12.380 --> 27:13.839
No.

27:36.571 --> 27:37.738
Damn it.

28:04.599 --> 28:05.933
It's been over four hours.

28:06.101 --> 28:09.812
Duane's blood is still clean.
I don't think he's infected.

28:10.021 --> 28:13.190
I'd like to untie him,
if that's all right.

28:21.116 --> 28:23.200
Sure, yeah.

28:29.124 --> 28:30.958
You know I'm gonna ask you why.

28:32.127 --> 28:33.919
Yeah, I know.

28:35.004 --> 28:38.382
So, why? Why didn't you do it?

28:42.011 --> 28:43.429
We need more alcohol.

28:51.187 --> 28:52.688
How you holding up, Pam?

28:52.897 --> 28:54.231
Good.
Good.

28:54.399 --> 28:56.442
It'll all be over soon.

29:04.743 --> 29:06.660
In fact...

29:07.996 --> 29:09.913
...I've been waiting
for this the whole time.

29:10.206 --> 29:13.417
- For what?
- To get you alone.

29:44.949 --> 29:46.617
She bled on him.

29:48.703 --> 29:50.704
He's got the virus.

30:06.638 --> 30:09.473
Doctor, check his wound again,
would you?

30:14.979 --> 30:16.021
Doctor.

30:16.189 --> 30:19.316
What does she need to examine him for?
You saw what happened.

30:19.818 --> 30:21.693
Did her blood actually
enter your wound?

30:21.903 --> 30:23.904
- Of course it did.
- We don't know for sure.

30:24.113 --> 30:26.114
Can't take a chance.
You know what to do.

30:26.282 --> 30:27.574
Nobody shoots my brother.

30:27.742 --> 30:30.118
He won't be your brother
much longer. You said it.

30:30.286 --> 30:32.412
- Nobody's shooting.
- You were gonna shoot me!

30:32.580 --> 30:35.707
- You don't shut your pie hole, I might.
- Dean, they're right.

30:35.917 --> 30:38.168
I'm infected.
Give me the gun and I'll do it.

30:38.419 --> 30:40.671
- Forget it.
- I won't become one of those things.

30:40.922 --> 30:42.714
- We've still got some time--
- For what?

30:43.258 --> 30:46.635
I understand he's your brother,
I'm sorry. I gotta take care of this.

30:46.845 --> 30:49.471
I'll say this once.
Make a move on him, you'll be dead.

30:49.639 --> 30:52.266
You understand me?
I mean, do I make myself clear?

30:52.475 --> 30:54.685
Dean.
- Then what are we supposed to do?

31:04.445 --> 31:06.989
Get the hell out of here, that's what.

31:07.198 --> 31:10.868
Take my car. You got the explosives.
There's an arsenal in there.

31:11.035 --> 31:14.872
You two go with him. You got enough
firepower to handle anything now.

31:15.081 --> 31:16.206
What about you?

31:20.211 --> 31:23.338
Dean, no, no.

31:23.506 --> 31:26.592
Go with them.
This is your only chance.

31:26.759 --> 31:30.846
- Not gonna get rid of me that easy.
- No, he's right, man. Come with us.

31:38.688 --> 31:40.063
Okay, it's your funeral.

31:47.030 --> 31:50.616
I'm sorry.
Thanks for everything, marshals.

31:50.825 --> 31:53.493
Oh, actually,
we're not really marshals.

31:54.162 --> 31:56.914
Um... Oh.

32:17.143 --> 32:21.188
Wish we had a deck of cards
or a foosball table or something.

32:23.524 --> 32:25.776
Dean, don't do this.

32:27.195 --> 32:29.529
Just get the hell out of here.

32:29.864 --> 32:31.740
No way.

32:36.746 --> 32:39.539
Give me my gun and leave.

32:41.167 --> 32:44.544
For the last time, Sam, no.

32:50.760 --> 32:53.261
This is the dumbest thing
you've ever done.

32:54.305 --> 32:58.183
I don't know about that.
Remember that waitress in Tampa?

33:00.144 --> 33:01.561
Dean, I'm sick.

33:03.106 --> 33:07.275
It's over for me.
It doesn't have to be for you.

33:07.485 --> 33:09.236
- No?
- No, you could keep going.

33:09.445 --> 33:10.946
Who says I want to?

33:12.782 --> 33:14.116
What?

33:24.585 --> 33:26.503
I'm tired, Sam.

33:27.296 --> 33:29.423
I'm tired of this job.

33:30.383 --> 33:32.467
This life.

33:33.011 --> 33:35.595
This weight on my shoulders.
Man, I'm tired of it.

33:35.763 --> 33:38.098
So, what?
So you're just gonna give up?

33:38.266 --> 33:40.267
I mean, you're just gonna
lay down and die?

33:40.435 --> 33:44.604
- Dean, I know the stuff with Dad had--
- You're wrong.

33:46.649 --> 33:48.859
It's not about Dad.

33:50.028 --> 33:53.488
- I mean, part of it is, sure--
- Then what is it about?

34:10.297 --> 34:12.549
You better come see this.

34:31.819 --> 34:38.283
There's no one. Not anywhere.
They've all just vanished.

34:51.964 --> 34:55.759
Well, it's been five hours
and your blood's still clean.

34:55.967 --> 34:58.178
I don't understand it,
but you dodged a bullet.

34:58.513 --> 35:00.097
But I was exposed.

35:00.306 --> 35:04.184
- How could I not be infected?
- I don't know, but you're just not.

35:04.393 --> 35:07.687
I mean, when you compare it
with the Tanners' samples...

35:07.897 --> 35:09.314
What the hell?

35:10.233 --> 35:11.274
What?

35:12.985 --> 35:15.821
Their blood.
There's no trace of the virus.

35:16.030 --> 35:18.782
No sulfur, nothing.

35:27.959 --> 35:31.711
Doc, the sarge and I are getting
the hell out of here, heading south.

35:31.879 --> 35:34.548
- You should come.
- I'd better get over to Sidewinder.

35:34.715 --> 35:38.885
Get the authorities up here,
if they'll believe me.

35:39.554 --> 35:40.971
Take care.

35:43.307 --> 35:44.474
What about him?

35:45.518 --> 35:48.436
He's gonna be fine.
No signs of infection.

36:01.284 --> 36:05.078
Hey, man, don't look at me.
I got no clue.

36:05.288 --> 36:07.581
I swear,
I'm gonna lose sleep over this one.

36:07.790 --> 36:09.457
I mean, why here? Why now?

36:09.667 --> 36:13.753
Where the hell did everybody go?
It's not like they just frigging melted.

36:14.130 --> 36:15.380
And why was I immune?

36:15.756 --> 36:18.592
Yeah. You know what?
That's a good question.

36:19.468 --> 36:23.013
You know, I'm already starting to feel
like this is the one that got away.

36:53.336 --> 36:56.087
Do you mind pulling over
up ahead there?

36:57.381 --> 36:59.299
All right.

37:06.057 --> 37:08.808
- I gotta make a call.
- No phone out here.

37:08.976 --> 37:10.894
I got it covered.

37:11.729 --> 37:12.812
What the hell is that?

37:41.342 --> 37:43.176
It's over. You'll be pleased.

37:43.678 --> 37:46.846
I don't think any more tests
are necessary.

37:48.057 --> 37:52.936
The Winchester boy,
definitely immune, as expected.

37:53.437 --> 37:56.731
Yes, of course.

37:56.899 --> 37:58.400
Nothing left behind.

38:31.475 --> 38:34.352
So... Last night.

38:34.729 --> 38:37.355
You wanna tell me what the hell
you were talking about?

38:38.316 --> 38:39.983
- What do you mean?
- What do I mean?

38:40.401 --> 38:42.902
I mean, you said
you were tired of the job.

38:43.154 --> 38:44.821
And that it wasn't because of Dad.

38:45.197 --> 38:47.991
- Forget it.
- No, I can't. No way.

38:48.200 --> 38:50.910
I thought we were gonna die.
You can't hold that over me.

38:51.078 --> 38:53.079
No, you can't pull that crap
with me, man.

38:53.247 --> 38:55.081
- You're talking.
- And what if I don't?

38:55.416 --> 38:59.252
Then I guess I'll just
have to keep asking until you do.

39:06.135 --> 39:10.180
I don't know, man.
I just think maybe we ought to...

39:13.267 --> 39:15.518
...go to the Grand Canyon.

39:17.938 --> 39:19.731
- What?
- Yeah, you know...

39:19.899 --> 39:22.442
...all this driving back and forth
across country.

39:22.651 --> 39:25.612
I've never been to the Grand Canyon.
Or we could go to TJ.

39:25.780 --> 39:28.114
Or Hollywood,
see if we could bang Lindsay Lohan.

39:28.282 --> 39:30.033
You're not making any sense.

39:31.660 --> 39:34.537
I just think we should
take a break from all this.

39:34.705 --> 39:36.956
Why do we gotta get stuck
with the responsibility?

39:37.166 --> 39:38.875
Why can't we live life a little bit?

39:39.085 --> 39:40.668
Why are you saying all this?

39:44.965 --> 39:48.093
No, no, no, Dean.
You're my brother, all right?

39:48.969 --> 39:52.222
So whatever weight you're carrying,
let me help a little bit.

39:57.144 --> 39:59.604
I can't. I promised.

39:59.980 --> 40:03.066
- Who?
- Dad.

40:06.195 --> 40:07.612
What are you talking about?

40:09.490 --> 40:11.991
Right before Dad died...

40:12.827 --> 40:14.994
...he told me something.

40:17.123 --> 40:18.957
He told me something about you.

40:22.670 --> 40:24.254
What?

40:26.590 --> 40:29.092
Dean, what did he tell you?

40:30.305 --> 40:36.417
