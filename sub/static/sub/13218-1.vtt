[panting] Everybody's going to the lake,
'cause there's this big hole in the fence.

02:14.282 --> 02:16.785
I was just thinking, you know,
maybe you wanna come?

02:16.868 --> 02:18.203
[gasping]

02:19.872 --> 02:22.291
Please! Please, Manfredo.

02:22.374 --> 02:27.212
I need bodies. I got 100 new inmates.
[stuttering] I'm dying here.

02:27.296 --> 02:30.632
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
They're all going, sir! Sir!

02:30.715 --> 02:32.384
Come on!
For you, it's another day in Max.

02:32.467 --> 02:34.428
-Sir!
-You know how to handle your shit

02:34.511 --> 02:36.055
with a few less COs.

02:36.138 --> 02:39.224
I got inmate-palooza here.
I am drowning in a sea of orange.

02:39.308 --> 02:41.686
Sir! They are all out!

02:41.770 --> 02:44.815
What the fuck do you think
I'm on the phone for, Bayley?

02:44.898 --> 02:47.275
I know they walked out. I am handling it.

02:47.358 --> 02:48.401
-Walk out?
-[Caputo] Call who?

02:48.484 --> 02:51.071
It's not a walk out, sir. They are--
They are running at full speed!

02:51.154 --> 02:52.405
[mouths]

02:55.366 --> 02:58.036
I'm the Director of Human Activity!

02:58.119 --> 03:00.788
Uh-huh, that's right.

03:00.872 --> 03:03.458
Well, why the hell not me?

03:03.541 --> 03:07.796
As of a few hours ago, asshole.
Why the hell am I even askin'?

03:07.880 --> 03:11.926
Send me some goddamn COs now!
That's an order.

03:12.009 --> 03:14.636
-[breathing heavily]
-That's right. I want six guys.

03:14.720 --> 03:16.805
And I want real guys.

03:17.849 --> 03:19.141
Thank you, Manfredo.

03:20.184 --> 03:22.854
I'll be expecting them within the hour.

03:25.731 --> 03:27.984
'Cause I'm the fucking warden.

03:28.817 --> 03:32.530
Sir? The majority of our inmate population

03:32.614 --> 03:35.408
has run out of the prison

03:35.492 --> 03:37.995
through a breach in the fence
on the south side of the field

03:38.078 --> 03:44.167
and is now swimming in the lake
adjacent to campus, sir... Warden.

03:44.918 --> 03:47.963
That's cool to say.
Uh, congrats on that, by the way.

03:56.472 --> 03:57.765
Hey!

03:58.892 --> 04:01.394
-[inmate whispering indistinctly]
-Hey!

04:01.477 --> 04:02.603
Hey!

04:02.686 --> 04:04.605
[inmate] Come on, come on, come on.

04:07.483 --> 04:09.110
Look at them run.

04:10.819 --> 04:14.323
You see that? Man, word travels fast.

04:14.407 --> 04:16.617
Yeah. Um, hey, can I get through, please?

04:16.700 --> 04:18.119
I can't believe this is happening.

04:18.202 --> 04:19.661
Sometimes you got to do
what you got to do.

04:19.745 --> 04:20.915
Will you get the fuck out of my way?

04:22.332 --> 04:24.919
Do you really think it's wise
to be speaking to me in that manner?

04:25.002 --> 04:27.587
Jesus, Chapman. [scoffing]
A little magic happens around here

04:27.671 --> 04:30.674
and you make it all about you,
like you made it happen. [stutters]

04:30.757 --> 04:32.426
[Piper] But I did, that's my point.

04:32.509 --> 04:35.679
I'm gangsta. Like with an "A" at the end.

04:35.762 --> 04:36.972
Excuse me.

04:38.848 --> 04:40.267
I sent that bitch to Max.

04:40.350 --> 04:44.313
There's a hole in the fence.
Everybody running to the lake.

04:44.396 --> 04:47.067
Nobody knows you, gangsta with an "A".

04:48.818 --> 04:51.779
Oh... Then why aren't you going?

04:51.862 --> 04:55.116
They don't let nice things
next to prisons.

04:55.200 --> 04:58.036
That lake probably
another Crestwood project.

04:58.119 --> 05:03.959
Storage for fracked gas or crude oil,
full of salt brine run-off.

05:04.042 --> 05:05.751
Who's going to complain?

05:05.835 --> 05:08.129
I think Miss Rosa get cancer
from that lake.

05:08.213 --> 05:11.592
That's horrible! And they're swimming
in that? You should tell people.

05:11.675 --> 05:14.095
No, no, no. I'm going in.

05:14.178 --> 05:17.806
Take a long, hot shower
in the good shower.

05:17.889 --> 05:20.184
No lines. No one to bother.

05:20.267 --> 05:24.396
Deep conditioner pack.
Replenish luster and shine.

05:25.314 --> 05:27.441
See you later, Thug Life.

05:30.444 --> 05:31.653
Wanna go to the movies or something?

05:31.737 --> 05:32.989
-No, I'm too riled up.
-[alarm blaring]

05:33.072 --> 05:34.324
-Skee ball?
-Yes.

05:34.407 --> 05:36.659
[inmates yelling indistinctly]

05:38.161 --> 05:39.871
[Bell] Look at that.

05:39.954 --> 05:42.707
-They're not stoppin' and droppin'.
-No, they are not.

05:42.790 --> 05:47.087
Something's going on. Maybe this is it.
Maybe they've finally decided to riot.

05:47.170 --> 05:50.257
-You know women don't riot.
-Oh, really? Do I know that?

05:52.175 --> 05:55.887
Maybe this tipped them over,
and you know what that would mean.

05:55.970 --> 05:58.807
We get to wear the riot gear. Oh, my God.

05:58.891 --> 05:59.975
I love the riot gear.

06:00.059 --> 06:02.686
I know you do, panda. I know you do.

06:02.770 --> 06:04.522
They're way understaffed.
It could get bad in there.

06:04.605 --> 06:08.109
It would serve them right.
Come on. We're done here.

06:08.984 --> 06:10.028
Fuck 'em.

06:17.451 --> 06:19.162
[grunting]

06:26.961 --> 06:29.548
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

06:29.631 --> 06:32.092
What the fuck
is taking you people so long?

06:32.176 --> 06:34.136
Just a lot of stuff to put on, sir.

06:34.219 --> 06:36.721
Hey, can someone
tighten my straps, please?

06:36.805 --> 06:37.806
Oh!

06:39.558 --> 06:41.851
We had no choice.

06:41.935 --> 06:45.105
I mean, you... you had no choice.

06:46.231 --> 06:49.026
One hundred twelve acres,
just for parking.

06:49.985 --> 06:51.112
What?

06:51.196 --> 06:56.742
The NSA headquarters has 112 acres
around the building, just for parking.

06:56.826 --> 07:00.746
That's like 85 football fields
full of NSA employees' cars.

07:01.539 --> 07:04.292
The No Such Agency. Shit.

07:04.375 --> 07:05.460
Secret.

07:06.086 --> 07:08.463
You know, we don't even know
what their budget is.

07:08.546 --> 07:11.049
But they get to know
who we're having phone sex with,

07:11.132 --> 07:12.258
how we pickin' our nose on the webcam--

07:12.342 --> 07:13.552
-Listen to me, listen to me.
-What?

07:13.635 --> 07:16.305
I can't-- I cannot go through this again.

07:16.388 --> 07:22.061
Lolly, I swear to you, Aydin was not NSA.
He was not NCS.

07:22.144 --> 07:25.897
Oh, no. CIA, DIA, NSB, INB--

07:25.981 --> 07:28.484
He was my old boss' hit man.

07:29.025 --> 07:31.695
What?
Not a very good one, obviously.

07:32.779 --> 07:34.656
He had his moments.

07:35.616 --> 07:38.536
[alarm blares and stops]

07:38.620 --> 07:40.372
-Did you hear that?
-[sighs]

07:40.455 --> 07:42.249
Or did you hear not that?

07:42.332 --> 07:44.417
Okay. [sighs]

07:44.501 --> 07:47.129
Okay, let's get the fuck out of here!

07:47.212 --> 07:49.256
I'm serious. It's crazy town out there.

07:49.339 --> 07:52.425
I'm trying to tell you,
let's just blow this taco stand.

07:52.509 --> 07:54.719
Look, let's just let somebody else
find this motherfucker.

07:54.802 --> 07:56.012
They ain't gonna know it was us.

07:56.096 --> 07:59.849
I was the last one seen in here.
They could trace this guy to me.

08:00.892 --> 08:03.354
Okay, then I will bounce.

08:03.437 --> 08:05.731
You were the one that killed him!

08:05.814 --> 08:09.443
Oh! I was just supposed to let him
strangle you to death?

08:09.527 --> 08:11.404
Did I need to say "to death"?

08:11.487 --> 08:16.033
[exhales heavily] Was I just supposed
to let him strangle you? To death? Hmm.

08:16.117 --> 08:19.287
-Either way... um, you are welcome.
-Okay.

08:19.370 --> 08:20.663
And I'm gonna go.

08:20.746 --> 08:23.582
-Wait!
-["Bad Day" playing on phone]

08:29.381 --> 08:30.632
Vause, I got three letters for you.

08:30.715 --> 08:34.385
You mention the fucking NSA
and I swear to Christ... Ugh!

08:34.469 --> 08:37.472
Check his boot.
They don't let guards have phones.

08:38.597 --> 08:40.725
-[cell phone chimes]
-[Alex] Now he's texting.

08:43.061 --> 08:45.522
Cover that. Cover that, cover that.
"Kubra."

[Alex sighs] Fuck!

08:50.360 --> 08:51.487
[Lolly] Ooh, what's that?

08:51.571 --> 08:52.822
[Alex] Emoji.

08:52.905 --> 08:54.490
They got more of those?

08:54.574 --> 08:56.784
Hmm, yeah. I mean, there's all kinds.

08:56.867 --> 08:58.994
Oh, I like the kitty with the heart eyes.

09:00.037 --> 09:02.248
[gasps] And the alien.

09:02.332 --> 09:04.041

09:12.467 --> 09:13.634
This shit is heavy.

09:13.718 --> 09:16.222
Is anyone else's helmet fogging up
when he breathes?

09:16.305 --> 09:17.806
How do you not make it fog up?

09:17.889 --> 09:21.643
I'm breathing out of my mouth in, like,
a downward direction, blowing down.

09:21.727 --> 09:23.437
In through my nose
and out through my mouth.

09:23.520 --> 09:25.481
Oh, shit, every time I talk it fogs up!

09:25.564 --> 09:28.108

-Feel that?
-Uh-huh.

10:06.315 --> 10:09.568
Now, that's definitely my softest part.

10:10.861 --> 10:13.364
That is really soft.

-It's like cocoa butter there.

-It's lumpy in the middle.
-I... I had my ears pierced.

and around the edge.

Back to camp. We have to go. They said.

10:50.985 --> 10:52.862
Wait. Why?

10:52.946 --> 10:54.782
-Because we're prisoners?
-[male officer 4] Damn it. Hey!

Why do we have to
sit in a box to pay for it?

11:07.878 --> 11:09.630
I didn't hurt anyone.

11:09.714 --> 11:12.383
Yeah, but dinner is at 4:45.

Yeah. It's gonna look great.
You look totally bloated.

11:47.086 --> 11:48.921
[sighs] He wouldn't take it from below.

11:49.005 --> 11:52.258
Would you stop moving your lips
and let me do my job?

11:52.341 --> 11:54.051
You just got to lie there and play dead.

and cover him with a tarp or something,
we could come back later and bury him.

You might wanna put that somewhere else.

13:08.378 --> 13:11.799
Oh. Jesus. [scoffing]
Fucking sick motherfuck.

13:11.882 --> 13:15.636
What? I can't believe he didn't buy that.
You looked totally dead.

13:19.682 --> 13:22.435
-Well, guess who's back on the ground?
-Uh-uh.

13:22.519 --> 13:26.940
Come on! [snaps fingers] Shirt up,
bra down, floobies out, face slack.

13:27.023 --> 13:29.860
Dead girl porn. Cosby dream shot.

13:29.943 --> 13:32.488
-Do it! Let's go!
-[sighs]

13:32.571 --> 13:34.280
[inmate 1] Girl, didn't you hear that?

13:34.364 --> 13:35.907
Anybody seen Crazy?

13:35.991 --> 13:37.951
<i>[scoffs] Not since her
and her cuckoo compadre</i>

13:38.034 --> 13:41.663
stepped on my sandcastle.
I know they didn't mean to, but still.

13:41.747 --> 13:43.499
-What did you say?
-[chuckling] I said, "Run,

13:43.582 --> 13:44.791
because if I catch you, I'll kill you."

13:44.875 --> 13:45.959
And they ran?

13:46.042 --> 13:47.920
-Bet your ass, they ran.
-Shit.

13:48.004 --> 13:51.591
Ran? They skipped. Laughing.
She didn't scare them.

13:51.674 --> 13:53.760
[Anita] Oh, no?
[Yoga Jones] They were having fun.

13:53.843 --> 13:55.928
[Taystee] But it still don't answer
where they gone.

13:56.012 --> 13:57.263
Have you two seen 'em anywhere?

13:57.346 --> 13:58.389
-Nope.
-No.

13:58.472 --> 14:00.432
[clicks tongue]
Man, now I'm startin' to worry.

14:00.517 --> 14:03.060
Hey, how come you two ain't wet?

14:03.144 --> 14:04.228
You ain't wet.

14:04.311 --> 14:06.397
-Hey, less talk, more walk, inmate.
-[grunts]

14:06.480 --> 14:08.440
Did you just push her?

14:08.525 --> 14:11.570
Officer, what's your name?
I haven't seen you before.

14:11.654 --> 14:13.906
Inmate, I'm from Max, where there's order.

14:13.989 --> 14:16.366
You wanna come live in my house?
Keep asking questions.

14:16.449 --> 14:19.202
Now, walk! Eyes forward, mouths shut.

14:20.704 --> 14:21.872
[all clamoring]

14:21.955 --> 14:23.832
Motherfucker.

14:30.005 --> 14:32.132
Are they, like, on a tour?

14:32.215 --> 14:34.384
Tourists don't have pillows and blankets.

14:35.343 --> 14:37.556
Overcrowding is dangerous.

14:37.639 --> 14:40.433
[sighs] We're already fighting
over resources.

14:41.309 --> 14:46.314
Well... think of it as a mandala...
of pussy.

14:56.324 --> 14:58.367
[indistinct]

15:07.670 --> 15:09.797
-I got 217.
-229.

15:09.880 --> 15:11.716
I got 226 inmates, sir.

15:11.799 --> 15:16.220
-Okay, I've, uh, two, three, four, five--
-Again.

15:16.303 --> 15:17.512
-Hmm?
-Count them again.

15:17.597 --> 15:21.141
And where are my printouts?
With the name and ID numbers on 'em.

15:21.225 --> 15:25.021
Uh, the printer was out of ink,
so Luschek is gonna fix it.

15:30.401 --> 15:31.444
[beeps]

15:32.988 --> 15:35.073
[printer whirring]

15:53.009 --> 15:54.135
<i>-[Caputo] Luschek?
-Hmm.</i>

15:54.218 --> 15:57.263
How long does it take you
to change the ink

15:57.346 --> 15:59.348
and print out some goddamn papers?

15:59.431 --> 16:01.142
<i>Hello? Are you there?</i>

16:01.225 --> 16:02.810
Yeah, they're printing.

16:02.894 --> 16:04.561
I'll be there as soon
as they're done printing.

16:04.646 --> 16:06.313
That's about the best I can do.

16:07.481 --> 16:08.650
You're a moron.

16:08.733 --> 16:11.653
Yeah, I love you, too.
Kisses. [kissing loudly]

16:11.736 --> 16:13.029
[softly] Dick.

16:26.293 --> 16:28.045
[farting]

16:34.134 --> 16:36.762
And they say
the art of gift-giving is dead.

16:41.810 --> 16:46.773
Listen, huh, if we don't get in there,
no one eats.

16:46.856 --> 16:50.234
Then no one eats.
Maybe that's appropriate.

16:50.318 --> 16:52.611
You break the rules,
you don't get your supper.

16:52.696 --> 16:56.115
Oh, this is ridiculous!
I'm going to speak to Caputo.

16:56.240 --> 16:57.241
Caputo!

16:57.325 --> 16:59.035
[Piscatella] Hold it.

16:59.118 --> 17:00.244
What's going on?

17:00.328 --> 17:02.621
Nothing that you should
concern yourself with, sir.

17:02.706 --> 17:04.875
My job is to make certain
the path is clear

17:04.959 --> 17:08.671
so you can do your job without hindrance.
We got this under control.

17:08.753 --> 17:10.881
-Yeah?
-[Piscatella] Yes, sir.

17:15.301 --> 17:17.221
-What's your name again?
-Piscatella, sir.

17:17.304 --> 17:18.888
-[hands clasping]
-Desi Piscatella.

17:20.265 --> 17:21.349
All right.

17:22.267 --> 17:23.310
Good work.

17:23.393 --> 17:24.729
Thank you, sir.

17:25.270 --> 17:26.896
Hey.

17:26.981 --> 17:29.359
You any relation to Daniella Picatelli?

17:30.318 --> 17:32.403
No, it's Piscatella, sir.

17:32.487 --> 17:34.114
-Piscatella.
-With an "S".

17:34.197 --> 17:35.573
Ah, gotcha.

17:35.656 --> 17:39.160
[chuckles] 'Cause Daniella was...
you know, very, very tall.

17:40.036 --> 17:43.373
Anyway. Okay.
Uh, Piscatella with an "S", good work.

17:43.456 --> 17:45.291
-Caputo!
-[Piscatella] Hey!

17:45.375 --> 17:47.460
-All right, troops.
-[sighs]

17:47.543 --> 17:49.880
-Let's scramble it up again.
-Let's go, come on.

17:49.963 --> 17:51.131
I think we're good here.

17:52.423 --> 17:53.675
Isn't that right, inmate?

17:53.760 --> 17:58.430
Just ducky,
Officer Piscatella with an "S".

17:58.514 --> 17:59.807
Mmm-hmm.

18:03.519 --> 18:05.146
Okay, so if they're not making dinner,

18:05.229 --> 18:07.398
can we just go back to our rooms
and get our candy and stuff?

18:07.481 --> 18:10.067
'Cause I got low blood pressure
and I'm gonna pass out.

18:10.151 --> 18:12.486
I gotta get out
of these wet clothes first.

18:12.569 --> 18:14.280
Ai! I got enough yeast...

18:14.363 --> 18:16.073
[in Spanish]
in my vagina to make a bread starter.

18:16.157 --> 18:17.700
[speaking English]
Ew, that was very vivid.

18:17.785 --> 18:19.036
I'm very damp.

18:19.119 --> 18:21.038
Yeah, well, who knows what's gonna be what

18:21.121 --> 18:22.705
in the dorms by the time
we get back in there.

18:22.790 --> 18:24.166
What are you talking about?

18:24.249 --> 18:26.251
It's sardine time, bitches.

18:26.334 --> 18:28.503
We a for-profit prison now.

18:28.586 --> 18:31.131
We ain't people no more. We bulk items.

18:31.214 --> 18:33.884
Can you check to see
if I'm bleeding through my pants?

18:33.967 --> 18:35.052
<i>-[sighs]
-Sí, puchi.</i>

18:35.135 --> 18:36.636
Guard? Guard!

18:38.096 --> 18:40.348
She needs to change her pad and her pants.

18:40.432 --> 18:43.061
She's bleedin' real bad
from the baby she just had. Show him.

18:43.144 --> 18:46.730
Oh, God. That... that is disgusting.
That is so disgusting.

18:46.815 --> 18:49.442
No, you know what's disgusting?
What's happening here.

18:49.525 --> 18:50.568
What you gonna do for her?

18:50.651 --> 18:52.070
No one's allowed to leave the room.

18:52.153 --> 18:55.323
So we're gonna ask you again.
What are you gonna do for her?

18:56.324 --> 18:58.159
Come on! Think!

18:59.493 --> 19:00.661
Really?

19:00.744 --> 19:02.413
Are we not talking English?

19:02.496 --> 19:04.623
So I'm a married lady.

19:04.707 --> 19:06.836
-[Big Boo chuckles]
-And you actually did it?

19:06.919 --> 19:09.797
I've still got his sperms inside of me
and everything.

19:09.880 --> 19:12.007
Really didn't need that level of detail.

19:12.091 --> 19:13.758
-But you missed the lake.
-[Big Boo] Mmm-hmm.

19:13.843 --> 19:15.177
But I got married.

19:15.260 --> 19:16.678
Yeah, but it was fun.

19:16.761 --> 19:19.264
I was on Big Boo's shoulders
and we were winning with chicken.

19:19.348 --> 19:20.975
-[laughing]
-[Leanne] No way!

19:21.058 --> 19:24.061
Uh, excuse me, I got married.
I had intercourse.

19:24.144 --> 19:27.022
With a man who is now my husband.

19:27.106 --> 19:28.941
My day was better than yours.

19:29.024 --> 19:32.070
My day was better than everyone's.

19:32.778 --> 19:34.697
Today is my wedding day.

19:34.780 --> 19:36.282
Anita built a sand castle.

19:36.366 --> 19:38.243
Crazy Eyes found a turtle.

19:38.326 --> 19:40.245
You're all a bunch of assholes.

19:40.328 --> 19:42.455
I feel like we all married the lake.

19:42.538 --> 19:44.332
-Don't you, ladies?
-Absolutely.

19:44.415 --> 19:46.084
We're forever changed.

19:46.167 --> 19:48.128
I still have lake water
running down my leg.

19:48.211 --> 19:50.296
[laughing]

19:50.380 --> 19:52.007
Fuckin' bitches is what you are.

19:52.090 --> 19:53.466
-I need this. [clears throat]
-Are you hearing me?

19:53.549 --> 19:55.635
What? What is going on?
Are you seeing this?

19:55.718 --> 19:57.346
Hey, man, bring that back.
She got married today.

19:57.429 --> 20:00.474
I need it. Sorry.
And, uh, it's unapproved.

20:01.433 --> 20:04.228
Morello, don't worry,
he can't help himself.

20:04.311 --> 20:06.813
For your information,
there's bleeding happening

20:06.898 --> 20:09.775
and I'm helping to absorb it.
With this. So...

20:09.859 --> 20:12.528
There are napkin dispensers
behind the food service counter.

20:12.611 --> 20:13.863
Can she please have her veil back?

20:13.946 --> 20:16.157
No, it's still an infraction.

20:22.998 --> 20:26.543
So it sounds like
the lake was really fun, huh?

20:26.626 --> 20:31.214
Well, actually...
I'm not sure how clean that water was...

20:31.298 --> 20:33.466
'cause I'm starting to get
a gnarly itch on my thighs.

20:33.550 --> 20:34.717
Me too.

20:35.635 --> 20:37.345
I'll scratch yours if you scratch mine.

20:37.429 --> 20:39.389
[Angie] But you bite your nails.

20:39.472 --> 20:40.807
I wanna hear about the fuckin'.

20:40.891 --> 20:42.184
-He got a big dick?
-[Big Boo chuckles]

20:42.267 --> 20:45.939
Well, Italian don't rhyme with stallion
for nothing. [chuckles]

20:46.022 --> 20:48.441
Although, I have always been very tight.

20:48.524 --> 20:50.151
I mean, even when I was doing it

20:50.234 --> 20:52.820
semi-regular with a guy
who used to put his shoe up there...

20:52.904 --> 20:54.613
Excuse me?

20:54.697 --> 20:56.407
Oh, it wasn't the shoe
that he wore on his foot.

20:56.490 --> 21:00.244
It was a new shoe.
We called it our "special doin' it shoe."

21:00.328 --> 21:04.290
[chuckles] It was a loafer.
We was in Catholic school.

21:05.791 --> 21:09.337
Anyway, even then it would just
snap right back, you know. Just Kegel.

21:09.420 --> 21:12.174
Again, heavy on the detail. Less is more.

21:12.257 --> 21:15.844
Oh, Boo Boo, you're such a prude today.
[chuckles]

21:15.928 --> 21:18.597
Let me tell you about the vows.

21:18.680 --> 21:21.141
Who likes the band Foreigner?

21:21.225 --> 21:22.309
-[indistinct]
-[Taystee] Yo.

21:22.392 --> 21:25.854
She did not drown.
She ran off with that turtle girl.

21:25.938 --> 21:29.441
[clicks tongue] Man, you see?
Hanging around white folks is a bad idea.

21:29.524 --> 21:31.151
-[laughs]
-I'm not white.

21:31.235 --> 21:32.402
Yeah, but you ain't brown.

21:32.486 --> 21:34.154
And you ain't shit. Racist.

21:34.238 --> 21:37.700
Black people can't be racist.
We have no power.

21:37.783 --> 21:39.160
I'm gonna have to call bullshit on that.

21:39.244 --> 21:41.997
I'm sorry, look, we may not be able
to act on our racism,

21:42.080 --> 21:46.334
like, put people in a ghetto,
send them to shitty school...

21:46.417 --> 21:48.211
-kill 'em in the back of police vans.
-Mmm.

21:48.294 --> 21:52.882
But we sure as shit can be as racist
as everybody else, 'cause this is America.

21:52.966 --> 21:56.970
-Land of the free, home of the racist.
-Right.

21:57.053 --> 21:59.431
[clicks tongue] Yo, is anybody worried
that Suzanne is AWOL?

21:59.515 --> 22:03.769
Yeah, we're all worried. But we're stuck.
And we're all moist and uncomfortable--

22:03.852 --> 22:05.604
-And I'm mostly dry.
-[snickers]

22:05.687 --> 22:06.813
-Damp. Is that better?
-[chuckles]

22:06.897 --> 22:09.483
Is moist, like, some kind of
trigger word for you?

22:09.566 --> 22:12.028
-What did you say?
-Trigger, man. She said trigger.

22:13.029 --> 22:16.365
-[whispering] She said "nigger"...
-Come on, now. Don't even.

22:16.448 --> 22:19.826
Hey! What? I'm bored!
Can't we have a race war? It'll be fun!

22:19.910 --> 22:21.537
We have to get back out there.

22:21.620 --> 22:24.832
What's your friend's name again?
Spout? Cylinder?

22:24.916 --> 22:26.584
What? Piper?

22:26.668 --> 22:29.796
Yeah. [stutters] Why do I have a block
on that stupid--

22:29.879 --> 22:31.048
[Lolly] Piper!
[Alex] No! Why?

22:31.131 --> 22:32.757
-Jesus. Stop!
-What?

22:32.840 --> 22:36.219
I have a cell phone between my tits
and keys in my twat.

22:36.303 --> 22:38.471
-Oh!
-And you just killed someone.

22:38.555 --> 22:40.432
You think now is really
the best time to socialize?

22:40.515 --> 22:42.725
Were you at the lake, too?

22:42.809 --> 22:44.144
Nobody told me it was happening.

22:44.227 --> 22:46.354
Do I look wet to you?

22:46.438 --> 22:48.774
[Lolly] As a matter of fact,
we did go to the lake.

22:50.734 --> 22:53.404
-It was delightful.
-Yep.

22:53.487 --> 22:55.114
What is going on with you?

22:55.198 --> 22:56.782
[Lolly] She just got too much sun,
she's fine.

22:56.865 --> 22:59.077
Listen, look over there.

23:00.078 --> 23:02.371
Look, please. Piper.

23:02.455 --> 23:06.167
I know. I know. This can't be good.

23:06.250 --> 23:08.586
Where is everybody gonna fit?

23:08.669 --> 23:10.338
No, no, no, no, no, no.

23:10.421 --> 23:13.967
Remember, on the plane to Chicago?
That girl, she fell asleep on me?

23:14.050 --> 23:16.303
She was scared to fly.

23:16.386 --> 23:18.638
-We stole her apple.
-Vaguely.

23:18.722 --> 23:21.475
-Okay, I think that's her.
-[Piper] I guess?

23:21.558 --> 23:25.562
No, that's her. I remember her face,
'cause she fell asleep on me.

23:26.771 --> 23:28.482
Cool. Alex?

23:28.565 --> 23:31.526
I can't talk to you right now, Piper.
I can't.

23:31.610 --> 23:34.279
All I wanna do is get out of here
and, you know, like, take a walk.

23:34.363 --> 23:36.531
-And I can't do that.
-[exhales heavily]

23:36.615 --> 23:38.826
So I'm feeling very frustrated.

23:38.909 --> 23:42.622
I hear you. You got a taste.
You want more. See, I didn't.

23:42.705 --> 23:45.916
I was inside while everybody else
was outside at the lake.

23:46.000 --> 23:47.335
Having fun.

23:48.586 --> 23:51.339
Yeah, I'm gonna need you
to piss off right now.

23:51.422 --> 23:53.216
You shouldn't talk to me like that.

23:54.175 --> 23:58.304
If you haven't heard yet, you will.
I am a force to be reckoned with.

23:59.054 --> 24:00.181
Okay.

24:00.973 --> 24:03.310
I'm gonna finish my book.

24:05.562 --> 24:06.897
Nick Hornby.

24:08.399 --> 24:09.983
<i>I liked High Fidelity.</i>

24:11.193 --> 24:12.319
Psst.

24:15.113 --> 24:17.158
Oh, a teardrop?

24:17.241 --> 24:19.701
-It's on the wrong side.
-What are you talking about?

24:19.785 --> 24:21.870
-Are they even tattoos?
-They're make-up.

24:21.953 --> 24:24.290
[scoffs] So they're for, like, decoration?

24:25.123 --> 24:27.419
-That's so cute.
-It's my thing.

24:28.503 --> 24:30.630
Well, where I'm from, it means something.

24:30.713 --> 24:32.089
What, like, you killed somebody?

24:32.174 --> 24:33.841
-No.
-No?

24:34.967 --> 24:38.180
No, I killed three somebodies.

24:38.263 --> 24:40.182
Nobodies. [scoffs]

24:40.265 --> 24:43.976
Then I get popped for fucking WIC fraud.
You believe that shit?

24:44.060 --> 24:46.604
Anyhow, eyeliner girl...

24:48.731 --> 24:51.735
-who's runnin' the game in here?
-The game?

24:51.819 --> 24:54.405
Oh, come on. Don't hold out on me.

24:54.488 --> 24:55.698
We're friends now.

24:55.781 --> 24:58.409
-We both love to cry in black.
-[scoffs]

24:58.492 --> 25:00.661
-So?
-[sighs]

25:00.744 --> 25:02.496
<i>Who's la jefa?</i>

25:07.668 --> 25:09.127
[Flaca] That one.

25:09.212 --> 25:12.548
Over there. The white girl.

25:12.631 --> 25:14.508
The reader.

25:14.592 --> 25:16.386
You serious?

25:16.470 --> 25:19.598
Cold like a Bomb Pop
from way back of the freezer.

25:19.681 --> 25:24.060
She may look all la, la, la...
but she the one.

25:25.729 --> 25:26.813
Huh.

25:28.106 --> 25:29.441
Interesting.

25:31.360 --> 25:34.988
[Maureen humming]

25:35.071 --> 25:36.823
It's a gingerbread house. [chuckles]

25:36.906 --> 25:39.701
-[laughs] No.
-It's like Berdie says!

25:39.784 --> 25:43.623
-Um, always say yes. "Yes, and..."
-Oh, yes.

25:43.706 --> 25:49.462
Yes, and... it tastes so delicious.

25:51.297 --> 25:52.382
[chuckles]

25:55.301 --> 25:57.011
[laughing]

25:58.846 --> 26:00.556
[Suzanne retches]

26:02.600 --> 26:05.521
Whatever paint is left on this,
is definitely lead-based.

26:05.604 --> 26:08.607
Lead-based and rotten wood and...

26:11.735 --> 26:13.362
-and fungus.
-[chuckles]

26:14.280 --> 26:15.322
Did I just bite a termite?

26:15.406 --> 26:18.158
-Maybe it's a big piece of ginger.
-No, stop.

26:18.241 --> 26:19.951
Stop, time-out.

26:20.035 --> 26:21.161
Do you think
there's any water around here?

26:21.244 --> 26:23.414
Uh, there's no time-outs. [chuckles]

26:23.497 --> 26:26.124
-Your brain can imagine anything.
-[scoffs]

26:26.207 --> 26:29.711
<i>-It made Time Hump. Right?
-[grunts]</i>

26:29.795 --> 26:32.715
It's magical. It is special. It's--

26:32.799 --> 26:35.009
But my tongue can't eat anything,

26:35.092 --> 26:39.221
<i>and you have got to stop
with this Time Hump thing.</i>

26:39.306 --> 26:41.391
It's over. Okay?

26:42.141 --> 26:43.601
Plus, it's gonna get dark soon.

26:43.685 --> 26:46.688
<i>But I love Time Hump.</i>

26:46.771 --> 26:48.648
You got to do more stories.

26:48.731 --> 26:54.780
Uh, maybe... the gingerbread tastes weird
because there's a spell on it.

26:57.240 --> 26:58.742
What happens next?

26:59.827 --> 27:01.036
I'm not sure.

27:01.119 --> 27:02.496
Take a minute.

27:03.414 --> 27:07.084
Let the, uh, story hula-hoop
around your brain hips. [chuckles]

27:08.168 --> 27:11.755
We've got time. We are never going back.

27:12.756 --> 27:14.174
What?

27:14.257 --> 27:17.636
We can live here forever.
We found a house. We can live in it.

27:19.054 --> 27:20.557
You can read me stories.

27:21.766 --> 27:24.936
And we can eat, uh, raccoon meat
and berries, and we could...

27:25.019 --> 27:28.357
-we could make love!
-[stammering] I really made a big mistake.

27:28.440 --> 27:30.567
-What are you doing?
-Um...

27:32.986 --> 27:34.654
There is...

27:36.072 --> 27:38.282
a witch inside that house.

27:39.534 --> 27:41.828
And...
[whispering] she wants to eat us.

27:41.911 --> 27:43.246
Then we kill the witch.

27:43.329 --> 27:44.999
Maybe we take out her intestines

27:45.082 --> 27:49.670
with a pitchfork
fashioned from wolves' teeth. [chuckles]

27:49.754 --> 27:53.716
[yelling] I don't wanna do this anymore!

27:54.759 --> 27:56.469
I'll wait.

27:56.552 --> 27:58.388
-[inmates yelling indistinctly]
-How many are we missing?

27:58.471 --> 28:01.724
Uh, I'm gonna say at least two,
but no more than 11.

28:01.807 --> 28:03.225
[sniffs] It might be 12.

28:03.308 --> 28:04.935
We're still getting
different numbers, sir.

28:05.019 --> 28:07.730
[scoffs] And we still don't have
the goddamn rosters.

28:07.813 --> 28:10.191
This is ridiculous.

28:10.275 --> 28:12.152
All right. This is what we're gonna do.

28:12.235 --> 28:14.696
All the original inmates,
they go back to their bunks.

28:14.780 --> 28:16.322
We do a regular count, bed by bed.

28:16.407 --> 28:17.991
And the newbies?

28:19.868 --> 28:22.579
[exhales heavily] They wait.

28:22.663 --> 28:25.081
Bayley, Thorpe,
you come walk the perimeter with me.

28:25.165 --> 28:27.501
See if we find some stragglers.
Let's go, let's go.

28:28.376 --> 28:30.796
<i>-[Luschek] Uh...
-What is it, Luschek?</i>

28:30.879 --> 28:32.756
<i>You might wanna come to the mail room.</i>

28:32.839 --> 28:35.134
Yeah? And you might wanna suck my dick.

28:35.217 --> 28:38.304
<i>Fucking incompetent.
I'll deal with you later.</i>

28:40.097 --> 28:41.391
I don't wanna suck his dick.

28:41.474 --> 28:43.685
This is really
some kind of shit-show, huh?

28:44.268 --> 28:47.522
To be fair, you've come
on a particularly crazy day.

28:48.355 --> 28:50.775
But also... yes.

28:50.858 --> 28:52.444
-[sighs]
-I'm taking you home.

28:52.527 --> 28:53.653
Oh, and then what?

28:53.736 --> 28:56.531
"Judy King skips out on prison."
They will crucify me.

28:56.614 --> 28:57.700
So we sit here?

28:57.783 --> 29:01.036
Yes, we sit. With Mr. Luschek.

29:01.119 --> 29:05.999
[chuckles] Uh, actually, I should probably
take these papers over there.

29:06.083 --> 29:07.585
You guys mind going back into the lobby?

29:08.836 --> 29:11.714
-Are you serious? You cannot be serious--
-I-- No, Bill. Calm down.

29:11.797 --> 29:13.757
-Hey, I really-- I gotta--
-[Judy] No. Really.

29:13.841 --> 29:14.883
What is it?

29:14.967 --> 29:18.679
I know you don't give a fig
about those papers, so, what?

29:18.762 --> 29:20.138
Is this your smoke break?

29:20.222 --> 29:22.726
Smoking is disgusting.

29:22.809 --> 29:25.604
Uh, I was gonna go take a nap.

29:25.687 --> 29:26.938
What is the matter with you?

29:27.021 --> 29:30.024
-[chuckles] I think he's funny.
-Thank you.

29:30.108 --> 29:31.860
None of this is funny, Judith.

29:31.943 --> 29:35.947
-Uh-oh. We have entered the "Judith" zone.
-[sighs]

29:36.030 --> 29:37.449
[Judy sighs]

29:37.532 --> 29:39.743
Bill, I think it's time.

29:39.826 --> 29:42.912
So, you wanna sit alone in the lobby?

29:42.996 --> 29:46.750
Well, if you go, uh, she can stay in here.

29:46.833 --> 29:49.920
-I'll hang out.
-Now you hear that? He'll hang out.

29:50.004 --> 29:52.131
So I'm being dismissed?

29:52.214 --> 29:55.009
I'm in prison now. It's hardened me.

29:55.092 --> 29:56.969
Nothing new about that, Mrs. King.

29:57.052 --> 30:00.097
Well, don't I know that, Mr. Montgomery.

30:00.180 --> 30:02.642
Go home. Go visit my husband.

30:02.725 --> 30:05.520
He's probably more upset about this
than the two of us put together.

30:06.979 --> 30:08.939
-This isn't your husband?
-No, he's the boyfriend.

30:11.108 --> 30:14.780
-Look at you.
-Well, just don't look too close, darlin'.

30:15.989 --> 30:19.993
[Gerber] Look at this. Sealed tight.
That was fast.

30:22.287 --> 30:23.914
[chain-link rattling]

30:24.956 --> 30:27.668
[Suzanne grunting]
Fuck. I'm sorry I'm so late.

30:27.751 --> 30:30.587
Please let me back in the prison!

30:30.671 --> 30:32.714
Jesus Christ.

30:34.007 --> 30:35.842
Thorpe, go get some wire cutters.

30:35.926 --> 30:38.220
Oh, thank you, Mr. Caputo. Thank you.

30:38.304 --> 30:42.266
No, she wanted the fairy tale.
I didn't. I just wanted dinner.

30:42.349 --> 30:44.435
"She"? Who's "she"?

30:44.519 --> 30:46.020
[gasps]

30:46.103 --> 30:48.314
-[inmates talking indistinctly]
-Keep the volume down.

30:48.397 --> 30:51.442
For now,
stay at the front of your cube for count.

30:51.526 --> 30:53.903
Do not enter your cube.
Do not change your clothing.

30:53.986 --> 30:58.700
Do not touch your personal effects.
Do not pass go. Do not collect $200.

30:58.783 --> 31:01.161
That is an order. Is that clear?

31:01.244 --> 31:02.495
[inmates continue talking]

31:02.580 --> 31:04.289
-[blares]
-[inmates groaning]

31:04.372 --> 31:07.459
-Jeez, stop!
-[Piscatella] I said, is that clear?

31:07.543 --> 31:08.627
[Red] Ugh.

31:08.711 --> 31:10.838
Stand in your doorways now.

31:12.214 --> 31:13.549
Inmate Whitehill.

31:14.466 --> 31:16.051
I see you're flying solo this evening.

31:16.719 --> 31:17.928
I don't know.

31:18.929 --> 31:20.347
Who is your roommate?

31:20.430 --> 31:24.142
We're not really friends.
She might be working for the other side.

31:24.226 --> 31:26.437
Not that she's a murderer--
Well, she could be.

31:26.520 --> 31:28.439
Who can you really trust these days,
you know?

31:28.522 --> 31:32.819
[Alex] Kukudio is missing.
And Whitehill's a little unique.

31:32.902 --> 31:34.487
Can you spell that?

31:34.571 --> 31:40.660
K-U-K-U-D-I-O. Could be K-U-C-K.

31:40.744 --> 31:43.246
I don't think there's a "C" in there.
I think it's only the two "K"s.

31:43.329 --> 31:45.331
Yeah, I don't recall asking you.

31:48.126 --> 31:49.460
Inmate Murphy.

31:51.088 --> 31:54.508
Do you corroborate the information
Inmate Vause is sharing with me?

31:55.926 --> 31:58.846
[stuttering] I would say
that Whitehill is unique.

31:59.889 --> 32:01.724
I'm not sure about the spelling thing.

32:01.807 --> 32:04.184
"You are absolutely unique.

32:04.268 --> 32:05.895
Just like everybody else." Margaret Mead.

32:05.978 --> 32:08.480
Another party heard from.

32:09.231 --> 32:11.859
Maybe it's time to start writing shots.

32:11.942 --> 32:14.613
Okay, looks like
everybody's here but Kukudio.

32:14.696 --> 32:16.865
-[inmates chuckling]
-What?

32:18.199 --> 32:20.535
[Caputo] They're left over
from when it used to be a men's prison.

32:20.619 --> 32:22.495
There's a bunch of them back here.

32:22.578 --> 32:25.206
The guards could live on campus back then.

32:25.290 --> 32:27.125
It was nice. By the lake.

32:27.208 --> 32:29.795
Uh, when the lake was still nice.

32:29.878 --> 32:31.880
[Gerber] I had no idea
these were even back here.

32:31.963 --> 32:36.009
We used to stay in little cabins like this
in the summer, when I was a kid,

32:36.092 --> 32:37.928
before my dad got into dog-dyeing.

32:41.515 --> 32:43.434
You're gonna explain, aren't you?

32:43.517 --> 32:45.812
I mean, only if you want me to.

32:45.895 --> 32:48.397
[sighs] Go. Quick.

32:48.480 --> 32:53.152
Uh, he dyes and grooms dogs,
so they look like wild animals.

32:53.235 --> 32:56.280
You know, pandas, zebras, tigers.
It's a thing.

32:57.614 --> 32:59.075
I'm sure it is.

32:59.158 --> 33:00.910
-Camels.
-We're done now.

33:00.993 --> 33:03.120
-[Gerber] Okay.
-[clattering]

33:04.289 --> 33:07.000
Come out. We know you're in there.

33:07.084 --> 33:08.961
[Maureen] No, you don't.

33:10.462 --> 33:12.589
We found her. Come and grab.

33:12.673 --> 33:14.549
<i>-[male dispatcher] Copy that.
-Stay here.</i>

33:14.632 --> 33:17.260
-Huh?
-[loon calling]

33:17.344 --> 33:21.139
-[telephone ringing]
-Hello?

33:21.223 --> 33:22.640
<i>[Jack] Why haven't you
been answering your phone?</i>

33:22.725 --> 33:25.686
I've been calling all day.
Do I have your cell?

33:25.769 --> 33:27.896
<i>-My assistant needs your cell.
-I, um--</i>

33:27.980 --> 33:29.023
<i>What a nightmare.</i>

33:29.107 --> 33:31.693
I know, I know, but I'm dealing--

33:31.776 --> 33:33.987
Have you seen her yet? [inhales]

33:34.070 --> 33:38.241
It was a last-minute switch,
but she was processed like everyone else.

33:38.324 --> 33:41.327
I mean, no special treatment... ish.

33:42.245 --> 33:43.872
Who-- Who did the strip search?

33:43.955 --> 33:48.167
Oh, Jesus. [sighs] Did you guys
make Judy King do a strip search?

33:48.251 --> 33:51.379
-[stammers] Judy King?
-You gotta stay on top of this, Joe.

33:51.462 --> 33:52.671
No fuck-ups.

33:52.756 --> 33:55.050
<i>-The press is gonna be sniffing around.
-[sighing]</i>

33:55.134 --> 33:57.636
<i>There's gonna be
a magnifying glass on the place,</i>

33:57.720 --> 34:00.555
<i>and I don't wanna see our ants fried.</i>

34:00.639 --> 34:02.557
<i>She's fine, but not too fine,</i>

34:02.641 --> 34:05.352
<i>'cause the public
wants to see justice served.</i>

34:05.435 --> 34:09.523
But we are humane to our prisoners, right?

34:09.606 --> 34:12.400
And in the end,
we don't wanna piss her off

34:12.484 --> 34:16.446
because she's got friends.
So thread the needle.

34:17.866 --> 34:19.699
What exactly does that mean?

34:19.784 --> 34:22.996
I don't know. How about don't fuck up?

34:23.079 --> 34:25.791
And goddamn it,
you are Director of Human Activity now.

34:25.873 --> 34:28.376
Get a fucking assistant
to answer your phones.

34:29.920 --> 34:31.045
Is that in the budget?

34:31.129 --> 34:33.214
No. Make an inmate do it.

34:34.590 --> 34:35.884
[sighing]

34:38.804 --> 34:41.931
Where the fuck is Judy King?

34:42.014 --> 34:45.726
We all know sex and love are different,
especially for men.

34:45.812 --> 34:46.853
See, why do people say that?

34:46.938 --> 34:50.440
Why does everyone assume that
men can't form emotional attachments

34:50.524 --> 34:52.068
-with sex like women do?
-Uh... [scoffs]

34:52.150 --> 34:54.402
I do. I get attached.

34:55.279 --> 34:57.406
So, I gotta be careful.

34:57.489 --> 34:58.657
That's very sweet.

34:58.740 --> 35:00.534
It's not. It's horrible.

35:01.327 --> 35:02.954
Are you in love right now?

35:03.913 --> 35:05.164
Aw.

35:05.247 --> 35:07.334
<i>[Caputo on radio] Doesn't anyone know
where Judy King is?</i>

35:07.417 --> 35:09.837
<i>How does no one have eyes on this woman?</i>

35:12.255 --> 35:13.256
Party's over.

35:13.340 --> 35:15.175
Pussy.

35:15.258 --> 35:17.010
To be continued, my friend.

35:17.094 --> 35:19.179
We'll see, inmate.

35:20.097 --> 35:21.681
[into radio] I got her.

35:21.764 --> 35:23.516
<i>[Caputo] Luschek?</i>

35:23.600 --> 35:25.685
Yeah, I tried to tell you.
We're in the mail room.

35:25.768 --> 35:27.896
Oh, and the, uh, rosters are ready.

35:27.980 --> 35:29.689
Still want me to suck your dick?

35:29.772 --> 35:31.566
[Sikowitz] Top left.

35:32.526 --> 35:34.863
Vernay, top right.

35:35.779 --> 35:37.115
Lafolo...

35:39.325 --> 35:40.659
top right.

35:40.743 --> 35:41.744
Washington?

35:42.745 --> 35:44.372
-Hey!
-[Sikowitz] Top left.

35:45.832 --> 35:47.791
[Rikerson] Chris, Fitzpatrick.

35:48.835 --> 35:50.294
[Sikowitz] Jenkins. Move it.

35:50.378 --> 35:51.921
[Rikerson] Left bunk two,
right bunk three.

35:52.005 --> 35:53.256
[Sikowitz] Top right.

35:53.339 --> 35:55.508
Smith, Green.

35:56.760 --> 35:58.387
[inmate] I'm owed an apology.

35:58.470 --> 36:00.222
Bottom left, top right.

36:00.305 --> 36:03.600
Remember, upper hand, right away.

36:03.683 --> 36:04.809
Establish dominance.

36:04.894 --> 36:05.978
Got it.

36:06.061 --> 36:07.812
Hapakuka, Dwight.

36:11.066 --> 36:13.318
You're in here, bottom right, top left.

36:14.236 --> 36:16.488
[guard] Uh, Kipness, top right.

36:19.950 --> 36:21.661
[Sikowitz] Stewart, top left.

36:21.744 --> 36:22.828
Top bunk, skinny.

36:22.913 --> 36:24.414
He said bottom right.

36:24.497 --> 36:27.458
Nope, that's my bed.
I've been here longer, and I'm not moving.

36:27.542 --> 36:29.210
Do you have a problem with that?

36:30.086 --> 36:32.005
-Well...
-Why don't you tell on me?

36:32.923 --> 36:34.549
Everybody around here loves a snitch.

36:34.632 --> 36:37.260
How do I even get up there?
I have bad knees.

36:37.343 --> 36:39.304
Do I look like I give a shit?

36:39.387 --> 36:41.264
Well, don't be a monster, Chapman.

36:41.347 --> 36:42.640
She's a big girl.

36:42.723 --> 36:44.225
Give her the bottom bunk, hmm?

36:50.399 --> 36:51.400
Ah!

36:51.483 --> 36:54.111
Aw, what happened? Did you hurt yourself?

36:56.447 --> 36:57.448
What's that?

37:00.076 --> 37:01.785
-An eight?
-It's infinity.

37:01.868 --> 37:03.704
-It's infected.
-Really?

37:03.787 --> 37:06.373
I have some rubbing alcohol.
Hold on a minute.

37:06.457 --> 37:08.209
Do you think it looks tough?

37:08.292 --> 37:09.793
I think it looks like an angry eight.

37:09.876 --> 37:11.171
What can I tell you?

37:15.467 --> 37:17.094
[Thorpe] King, you're in here.
[Judy] Oh.

37:17.177 --> 37:18.678
I have you on top of Washington.

37:18.761 --> 37:20.097
Are you Washington?

37:22.224 --> 37:24.101
Hi, I'm Judy.

37:24.184 --> 37:26.561
[inhales and exhales deeply]

37:28.271 --> 37:29.272
Well, oh-- Okay, then.

37:29.356 --> 37:31.149
-[chuckles]
-[Caputo] Hold up, uh, Miss King?

37:31.233 --> 37:33.026
Miss King?

37:33.110 --> 37:34.194
-Hey, there.
-Huh?

37:34.277 --> 37:36.405
Me again. Uh, we met earlier.

37:36.489 --> 37:38.449
-Mr. Caputo.
-Right.

37:38.532 --> 37:41.119
Yes. Uh, there's been a mistake.

37:41.202 --> 37:43.329
You shouldn't be in the ghet--

37:43.412 --> 37:45.789
Get this, get that. Ge-- Um...

37:47.000 --> 37:48.334
You shouldn't be in this dorm.

37:48.417 --> 37:50.211
-[whispers] Taystee!
-[Caputo] Um...

37:50.294 --> 37:51.837
So, we've assigned you somewhere else.

37:51.920 --> 37:54.548
-Uh, please come with me.
-Oh, well, okay.

37:54.632 --> 37:55.758
[chuckles] Bye.

37:55.841 --> 37:57.843
[stammering] Wait, what...

37:59.137 --> 38:01.640
Did nobody fuckin' see that?

38:08.772 --> 38:09.939
<i>Shalom.</i>

38:11.900 --> 38:14.528
<i>Assalam-alaikum.</i>

38:18.532 --> 38:19.866
[whispers] Oh, fuck.

38:22.995 --> 38:24.455
Where have you been?

38:24.539 --> 38:26.874
-[smooching]
-Jesus! What the hell, girl?

38:26.957 --> 38:28.876
[whispers] Sorry.
I've been in the forest. I--

38:28.959 --> 38:30.795
I don't know if I'm in trouble or not.

38:30.878 --> 38:33.048
I... ate... lead.

38:33.131 --> 38:34.424
Girl, we've all eaten lead.

38:34.507 --> 38:36.176
That's probably why
half of us are in here.

38:36.259 --> 38:37.302
Whoa.

38:38.261 --> 38:39.637
-The beds grew.
-Yeah.

38:39.720 --> 38:41.764
[whispers] Maybe you were
better off in the forest.

38:41.847 --> 38:43.474
Oh, no.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

38:43.558 --> 38:45.310
I don't care. I am home.

38:45.393 --> 38:48.563
And Kukudio? She is batshit crazy.

38:48.647 --> 38:49.815
You don't say.

38:49.898 --> 38:51.358
Exes.

38:51.442 --> 38:53.277
What are you gonna do?

38:54.403 --> 38:56.280
[snoring loudly]

38:56.363 --> 38:58.490
[inmate crying]

39:26.478 --> 39:27.812
Lolly.

39:27.895 --> 39:30.107
Lolly, get up.
We gotta go take care of this.

39:30.190 --> 39:31.483
What?

39:32.609 --> 39:35.737
Our friend in the greenhouse? Get up.

39:35.820 --> 39:37.572
The friend?

39:37.655 --> 39:40.118
[gasps] Are we still in Green Bay?

39:40.868 --> 39:42.120
[sighs]

39:44.247 --> 39:45.456
Never mind. Just...

39:46.457 --> 39:47.750
[whispers] go to sleep.

39:51.837 --> 39:54.923
[woman crying]

40:04.643 --> 40:07.020
[breathing heavily]

40:32.755 --> 40:35.550
[Caputo] They left you in here alone?
Jesus Christ.

40:35.633 --> 40:37.427
-What did you see?
-Nothing.

40:37.510 --> 40:38.969
What did you see?

40:39.053 --> 40:40.846
A Kardashian, maybe?

40:40.930 --> 40:42.973
[sighs]

40:44.058 --> 40:45.351
Stick with your first answer.

40:47.353 --> 40:48.771
Maureen Kukudio.

40:50.105 --> 40:51.316
Maureen Kukudio.

40:51.399 --> 40:53.944
Let's learn a little bit about you.

40:57.823 --> 40:58.949
Whoa.

41:01.368 --> 41:02.411
Look at that.

41:02.494 --> 41:03.579
[chuckles]

41:03.662 --> 41:06.332
Who likes to be predictable, right?

41:06.415 --> 41:07.999
[exhales sharply]

41:09.125 --> 41:12.296
What am I gonna do with you,
Maureen Kukudio?

41:12.379 --> 41:14.923
Send me to bed? But feed me first, then...

41:15.006 --> 41:16.007
send me to bed?

41:16.091 --> 41:18.595
-You ran away.
-Yeah, everyone ran away.

41:18.678 --> 41:19.846
You extra ran away.

41:19.929 --> 41:21.806
You guys were the ones
that took the fence down.

41:21.889 --> 41:23.641
I... I got lost out there. I took shelter.

41:23.725 --> 41:24.726
I almost froze to death.

41:24.809 --> 41:27.103
-It's 78 degrees.
-I could've died

41:27.187 --> 41:28.855
while under your watch.

41:29.814 --> 41:32.066
What if the warden found out about this?

41:33.318 --> 41:34.652
I am the warden.

41:35.653 --> 41:36.904
Really?

41:36.988 --> 41:38.906
A rose is a rose.

41:40.617 --> 41:43.078
I like your... sunflower.

41:48.125 --> 41:51.169
Get out. Go to bed.

41:51.254 --> 41:52.255
No dinner.

41:52.963 --> 41:54.382
Stay out of my sight.

41:57.843 --> 41:59.011
[exhales]

42:27.123 --> 42:28.124
Mmm.

42:30.336 --> 42:32.880
[Coates] So, I thought
everything was cool, right?

42:32.963 --> 42:34.757
-[Gerber] Mmm-hmm.
-But now every time I see her,

42:34.840 --> 42:36.634
she's really mean to me.

42:36.717 --> 42:38.010
Well, what'd you do?

42:38.093 --> 42:39.679
Nothing.

42:39.762 --> 42:42.014
I mean, our--
Our work schedules have changed,

42:42.097 --> 42:43.599
and so we haven't been
seein' each other as much.

42:43.683 --> 42:44.850
Maybe she's mad about that.

42:44.934 --> 42:47.270
[Gerber] What does she do?

42:47.353 --> 42:50.398
[Coates] She was a... trucker.

42:50.481 --> 42:52.275
-[Gerber] Mmm-hmm.
-But, uh...

42:52.358 --> 42:55.696
she had an accident,
so she's been taking some time off.

42:55.779 --> 43:00.075
[Gerber] Well, look... if you're
having trouble talkin' to her in person,

43:00.158 --> 43:01.410
just text her, man.

43:01.493 --> 43:03.244
Maybe like...

43:05.080 --> 43:08.542
-[breathes rapidly]
-[Aydin wheezing]

43:08.625 --> 43:11.211
[Coates and Gerber continue indistinctly]

43:11.295 --> 43:12.421
That's cute.

43:12.504 --> 43:14.548
She'll like that. Chicks love baby faces.

43:14.631 --> 43:16.091
Yeah.

43:16.174 --> 43:17.926
She don't really text a whole lot.

43:18.802 --> 43:19.846
[indistinct radio chatter]

43:19.929 --> 43:22.307
Mmm-mmm. Mmm-mmm. Mmm-mmm. Mmm-mmm.

43:22.390 --> 43:24.559
-[radio chatter continues]
-[Aydin continues wheezing]

43:27.103 --> 43:29.647
[Aydin whispering] Help.
[Gerber] Okay, uh, if I ever text you,

43:29.731 --> 43:31.858
I'm just gonna use
letters and numbers.

43:31.941 --> 43:33.735
-[Aydin wheezes]
-[Coates] That's cool.

43:33.818 --> 43:35.862
But not the number 12, okay?

43:40.700 --> 43:42.535
[wheezes]

43:44.622 --> 43:45.956
[Coates] Yeah, yeah, yeah.

43:51.795 --> 43:54.465
[Coates and Gerber
continue talking indistinctly]

43:54.548 --> 43:56.299
[Aydin continues wheezing]

44:13.568 --> 44:14.694
[cries softly]

44:21.868 --> 44:23.453
[shudders]

44:24.913 --> 44:26.205
[sobbing]

44:31.085 --> 44:33.631
[Coates talking indistinctly]

44:51.190 --> 44:52.316
[sobs]

45:11.587 --> 45:13.379
[inhales sharply]

45:24.433 --> 45:25.893
[whispering] Oh, my God.

45:27.520 --> 45:28.688
[cries softly]

45:30.397 --> 45:31.899
[loud snoring]

45:55.591 --> 45:57.425
[gasps] What? What?

45:58.802 --> 46:00.428
Rise and shine.

46:00.513 --> 46:02.055
[whispers] What's going on?

46:02.139 --> 46:04.057
-What time is it?
-3:30 a.m.

46:04.141 --> 46:07.227
You wanted to feed the troops.
It's time for your shift.

46:07.310 --> 46:09.354
But I don't start until 4:30.

46:09.437 --> 46:12.441
Breakfast starts at 4:30 now,
more bodies to feed.

46:13.527 --> 46:15.612
Get up.

46:15.695 --> 46:17.656
Don't keep the people waiting.

46:21.492 --> 46:23.202
[sighs]

46:23.286 --> 46:25.747
Who's gonna eat at 4:30?

46:29.626 --> 46:31.836
[slurping]

46:38.553 --> 46:40.387
[indistinct talking]

46:46.727 --> 46:48.187
[Healy] Capudog!

46:49.521 --> 46:50.898
Where you goin'?

46:50.981 --> 46:53.776
Home. Shower. Sleep.

46:53.859 --> 46:54.902
Oh, sure.

46:54.985 --> 46:56.821
Now that you're the big boss man,

46:56.904 --> 46:59.364
you get to sleep all day
while the rest of us have to work, huh?

46:59.448 --> 47:01.117
Pretty good life you got there, buddy.

47:02.703 --> 47:03.787
Healy, Healy...

47:08.249 --> 47:11.211
I had something
I needed to say to you. I--

47:11.294 --> 47:13.922
Shit. My brain is not workin'.

47:14.005 --> 47:15.423
Somethin' about the new inmates?

47:15.506 --> 47:17.425
Guard walk-out?

47:17.508 --> 47:19.595
Who told you about the guard walk-out?

47:19.678 --> 47:22.347
I saw Maxwell at Jamba's.

47:22.430 --> 47:24.432
Boy, she is one angry...

47:27.436 --> 47:28.437
lady.

47:29.271 --> 47:30.439
Talked my ear off.

47:30.522 --> 47:32.524
Anyway, don't worry.

47:32.609 --> 47:34.151
I'm brought up to speed.

47:35.486 --> 47:36.863
Go change your suit.

47:38.197 --> 47:39.991
Be the big dog. Woof!

47:40.825 --> 47:41.826
[sighs]

47:41.909 --> 47:43.119
Capudog!

47:43.202 --> 47:44.328
Woof!

47:49.041 --> 47:50.878
Hey! Morticia!

47:50.961 --> 47:54.673
We gotta take care of some
non-plant matter in the greenhouse.

47:54.757 --> 47:56.508
Do you get what I am saying?

47:56.591 --> 47:57.592
You with me?

47:59.386 --> 48:02.264
She's-- She's with me. We love gardening.

48:06.894 --> 48:08.353
[Healy whistling]

48:12.190 --> 48:14.777
[chuckles] Oh! Well...

48:14.860 --> 48:17.446
Good morning, handsome.

48:17.530 --> 48:18.907
I'm Judy King.

48:20.992 --> 48:22.118
Sam Healy.

48:22.201 --> 48:23.870
Ah. [chuckles]

48:26.122 --> 48:28.124
[woman speaking indistinctly on PA]

48:34.798 --> 48:36.215
-[Lolly gasps]
-[door closes]

48:38.509 --> 48:39.887
What the fuck did you do?

48:41.430 --> 48:42.682
Nice try.

48:43.724 --> 48:45.392
It was self-defense.

48:45.475 --> 48:48.187
He was killing me. We had no choice.

48:50.690 --> 48:52.817
I'm bored. What's the plan?

48:54.318 --> 48:56.153
Bury him under the floorboards.

48:56.987 --> 48:59.573
Well, that's dumb.
Haven't you ever killed someone before?

48:59.656 --> 49:02.242
No. Have you?

49:02.326 --> 49:03.869
That's personal.

49:03.953 --> 49:06.581
But if I had, I'd know better
than to waste my time

49:06.664 --> 49:09.918
diggin' one 6-foot hole,
when I could dig six 1-foot holes.

49:10.001 --> 49:11.252
That's just murder math.

49:12.462 --> 49:14.380
What are you talking about?

49:15.465 --> 49:17.383
Fuckin' amateurs.

49:17.467 --> 49:19.427
It's got to go in the garden.

49:19.510 --> 49:22.848
The earth's already soft
and dug and turned.

49:22.931 --> 49:24.891
I am not cutting up a body.

49:24.975 --> 49:26.101
[sighs]

49:36.946 --> 49:38.155
[jingles keys]

49:41.117 --> 49:44.661
I was supposed to
transplant the sunflowers today.

49:48.499 --> 49:50.459
I'll keep these as a thank-you.

49:57.342 --> 49:59.636
You gotta start
cutting along the joint line,

49:59.719 --> 50:02.848
and whatever you do,
don't puncture the intestines.

50:09.146 --> 50:11.273
That's it for the toast. Sorry, people.

50:11.356 --> 50:12.941
-You've got to be kidding me.
-[inmate groans]

50:13.025 --> 50:14.484
That's the only crunchy thing
we get today.

50:14.567 --> 50:16.528
Without toast, this is just slop.

50:16.611 --> 50:17.905
There's really no more toast?

50:17.988 --> 50:20.699
These are new days.
The early bird gets the toast.

50:20.784 --> 50:22.410
[Piper] Red...

50:22.493 --> 50:23.744
you owe me for the Hawaiian.

50:23.828 --> 50:25.955
[scoffs] You watchin' this shit?

50:26.039 --> 50:27.957
Cleopatra was talkin' for reals.

50:28.041 --> 50:29.959
Guess you can't judge a book, huh?

50:33.797 --> 50:35.631
For you, Your Majesty.

50:35.714 --> 50:37.133
Thank you.

50:39.468 --> 50:41.637
<i>[clears throat] After you, jefa.</i>

50:43.098 --> 50:44.141
Do I know you?

50:44.224 --> 50:45.976
I just heard things.

50:46.060 --> 50:47.978
You heard things.

50:48.979 --> 50:49.980
Really?

50:52.774 --> 50:53.943
Okay, then.

50:55.820 --> 50:57.071
Have a nice day.

50:59.114 --> 51:00.574

[rock music ends]

52:10.688 --> 52:12.107
The flowers look nice.

52:13.984 --> 52:16.528
Well, I don't know about you,
but I'm starving.
