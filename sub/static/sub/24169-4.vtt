[pop music playing]

00:10.010 --> 00:13.930
[music playing on headphones]

00:14.014 --> 00:18.518
[drill whirring]

00:21.271 --> 00:22.105
Nice.

00:22.188 --> 00:24.858
Oh, it is a good thing we moved Gary

00:24.941 --> 00:27.485
because the geologist at the project site
seems pretty sharp,

00:27.569 --> 00:29.446
and I think she would've noticed
a talking head.

00:29.529 --> 00:33.658
I, too, have news.
I've broken ground on our bookshelves.

00:33.742 --> 00:35.035
Oh.

00:38.538 --> 00:39.372
[clicks tongue]

00:40.498 --> 00:41.332
[clicks tongue]

00:44.085 --> 00:45.462
Seems perfect.

00:45.545 --> 00:47.839
And I got the last of the cherry wood
at the lumber yard.

00:47.922 --> 00:50.508
Met a guy in the parking lot
who offered to build them for 50 bucks,

00:50.592 --> 00:54.012
but I said,
"No, sir, I need to do this myself,

00:54.095 --> 00:56.639
and you are not wearing shoes."

00:56.723 --> 00:59.768
-Mm.
-I'm thinking about this for the design.

01:01.853 --> 01:04.147
Those are the bookshelves
in the Nazi's house.

01:04.230 --> 01:07.567
-You wanna build Nazi bookshelves?
-The bookshelves weren't Nazis.

01:07.650 --> 01:09.861
If anything,
those shelves were Nazi-occupied.

01:09.944 --> 01:13.031
Mm, okay. So, you wanna take a break
and go kill Gary?

01:13.573 --> 01:14.783
Sure, I could take a break.

01:14.866 --> 01:17.494
Great, and then I can go grocery shopping
for our dinner with Lisa,

01:17.577 --> 01:21.164
and you can spend the rest of the day
building your Nazi bookshelves.

01:21.623 --> 01:24.667
Perfect. And maybe
we just call them "bookshelves."

01:25.043 --> 01:26.252
[Sheila] That might be hard.

01:33.927 --> 01:36.554
When we returned her car,
Kayla was so excited.

01:36.638 --> 01:39.599
She can't wait to get to Michigan
and start her new life.

01:39.682 --> 01:43.186
And her baby is so adorable.

01:43.269 --> 01:45.939
-[chuckles]
-So cute. I could eat her with a spoon.

01:47.065 --> 01:50.110
-I would never eat her with a spoon.
-Oh, Hailey.

01:50.193 --> 01:52.237
Look at her. She's growing up so fast!

01:52.320 --> 01:53.822
She's gonna be taller than me soon.

01:54.239 --> 01:55.115
She already is.

01:56.074 --> 01:59.369
-So, wow, closure! Isn't that great?
-I love it.

01:59.452 --> 02:02.038
So, we have a few thoughts
on your "departure."

02:02.122 --> 02:04.999
There's a beautiful overlook
at the top of Pike's Ridge

02:05.083 --> 02:06.584
that we sometimes hike to.

02:06.668 --> 02:09.546
[Sheila] Yeah, we could lay you down
in a meadow of wildflowers.

02:09.629 --> 02:12.298
And as the butterflies say goodbye
to the morning dew...

02:12.382 --> 02:16.678
So, too, will we say farewell
to Gary West.

02:17.637 --> 02:20.890
-Yeah, I don't wanna do that.
-Well, we know you also like porn.

02:20.974 --> 02:22.892
You could watch a few girls go at it
for a while,

02:22.976 --> 02:24.727
and we could shoot you
in the back of the head.

02:24.811 --> 02:25.937
There are no wrong choices.

02:26.813 --> 02:30.150
-No, I don't want to die at all.
-What?

02:30.233 --> 02:33.069
But-- But-- Hey, hang on. Hey.

02:33.153 --> 02:37.198
What I think Joel is saying is,
"But-- But-- Hey, hang on. Hey.

02:37.282 --> 02:40.326
You said if we gave the deed to Kayla,
you'd be ready to go."

02:40.410 --> 02:43.997
I've been thinking about it, and I want
to live to see Kayla turn her life around.

02:44.080 --> 02:45.373
I want to see Hailey grow up.

02:46.291 --> 02:47.750
You're a talking head in a flower vase.

02:47.834 --> 02:49.252
Still better looking than you, buddy!

02:49.335 --> 02:51.212
-Not in a swimsuit.
-Guys!

02:51.296 --> 02:53.923
How do you have so much testosterone
without balls?

02:54.007 --> 02:55.341
She asked you a question, Joel.

02:57.010 --> 03:00.263
I say we open a window, put him
on the sill, and crack him like a walnut.

03:00.847 --> 03:03.933
I feel like my life could
still have meaning.

03:04.017 --> 03:07.478
Put an iPad in front of me. I can follow
Kayla's life on Instagram and Facebook.

03:07.562 --> 03:12.275
Look, I know we didn't shake on this deal,
but we had an agreement.

03:12.567 --> 03:15.069
If you guys want to kill me,
I can't stop you.

03:15.778 --> 03:16.946
I mean, it is two against one.

03:19.282 --> 03:21.367
All I'm saying is, I don't wanna die.

03:22.452 --> 03:24.454
He doesn't want to die.

03:24.537 --> 03:27.415
I know, but we can't keep a head
in our basement forever.

03:27.498 --> 03:30.418
I know, but we can't kill him
if he's begging us not to.

03:30.501 --> 03:32.253
-I know!
-So, we're on the same page.

03:32.337 --> 03:34.881
-The same shitty page.
-Then why are we fighting?

03:34.964 --> 03:36.799
We're not fighting.
We're having a heated agreement.

03:37.759 --> 03:40.511
Good morning, adults. How am I?

03:40.595 --> 03:43.056
Well, something happened yesterday
you might wanna know about.

03:43.139 --> 03:46.392
What was it?
I met another undead person.

03:46.476 --> 03:48.895
Oh, crap. You found Gary.

03:48.978 --> 03:51.773
Yes. And, boy,
way to keep it interesting, guys.

03:51.856 --> 03:55.443
But I was actually talking about the girl
who dated Eric for five minutes.

03:55.526 --> 03:56.986
-Ramona.
-What?

03:57.654 --> 03:58.571
Ramona?

03:59.405 --> 04:02.283
Rite Aid girl is undead?
How's that even possible?

04:03.493 --> 04:05.245
-Did you bite her?
-No!

04:05.328 --> 04:07.914
I don't just run around biting people.
I've never even met her.

04:07.997 --> 04:11.084
-Well, if you didn't bite her...
-Then how did she get sick?

04:11.167 --> 04:14.754
Oh, my God! If we find out
what you two have in common...

04:14.837 --> 04:17.215
We might finally understand
what happened with me.

04:17.298 --> 04:19.259
I know!
And figure out how this all started!

04:19.342 --> 04:22.095
-I know! And see if other people have it!
-I know!

04:22.178 --> 04:24.555
-It could be spreading.
-That's what I'm saying.

04:24.639 --> 04:26.474
Then why does it feel
like we're still fighting?

04:27.809 --> 04:30.603
Yeah, that's weird.
We have to talk to Ramona.

04:30.687 --> 04:32.522
-Any idea where she lives?
-Yeah.

04:32.605 --> 04:34.649
-I can take you there.
-No, give us the address.

04:34.732 --> 04:37.819
-You need to go to school.
-Seriously? Guys, come on.

04:37.902 --> 04:39.570
-Include me.
-Your mother's right.

04:39.654 --> 04:41.864
One person in this family
should have a normal life.

04:41.948 --> 04:43.032
Not totally normal.

04:43.116 --> 04:46.494
Someone's getting chocolate milk
in their lunch today.

04:46.577 --> 04:48.371
-Ooh.
-Fine, I'll go to school.

04:48.454 --> 04:50.999
Oh, can I ask one question
about the head in our basement?

04:51.416 --> 04:53.835
-Sure.
-What the fuck?

04:54.335 --> 04:57.088
Well, Gary was the first person I sampled,

04:57.171 --> 04:59.007
and we didn't know
we had to kill the brain.

05:00.842 --> 05:03.344
Destroying the brain
is literally the one thing

05:03.428 --> 05:05.847
that everybody knows about the undead.

05:08.224 --> 05:11.769
You were there when we buried him!
I didn't see you picking up a stake!

05:11.853 --> 05:13.313
-[door slams]
-Yeah.

05:15.648 --> 05:19.152
Maybe we make Gary's life so unpleasant
he wants to die.

05:19.235 --> 05:20.987
Well, we already took his body away.

05:21.070 --> 05:23.197
What are we gonna do?
Stop brushing his teeth?

05:23.281 --> 05:24.490
You brushed his teeth?

05:24.574 --> 05:26.993
We don't want that hole in his cheek
to get any bigger.

05:28.161 --> 05:30.705
Anyway, I'm sorry you didn't get back
to your bookshelves.

05:30.788 --> 05:34.459
-I could've talked to Ramona myself.
-No, I should be here.

05:34.542 --> 05:37.670
Besides, if this is the rise of the undead
and the end of humankind,

05:37.754 --> 05:41.382
-we may not need bookshelves.
-Yeah, well, I'll still wanna read.

05:41.466 --> 05:43.634
-[footsteps approaching]
-[Joel gasps]

05:43.718 --> 05:46.304
Hi, Ramona. Do you remember me?

05:46.387 --> 05:48.723
I'm Joel. And this is my wife, Sheila.

05:48.806 --> 05:50.850
Hello, Sheila.
It's nice to finally meet you.

05:50.933 --> 05:52.393
It's great to meet you, Ramona.

05:52.477 --> 05:56.522
Here, let me help you with that.
We just wanted to talk to you about--

05:57.190 --> 06:00.401
-Jesus Christ.
-No, thank you, I'm not religious.

06:00.485 --> 06:02.570
There are body parts in here.

06:02.653 --> 06:03.571
Yeah, that's my lunch.

06:04.822 --> 06:05.865
Why don't we go inside?

06:11.204 --> 06:14.624
-Hey, Eric. How you holdin' up?
-I'm okay.

06:15.666 --> 06:18.002
No, I'm not.
I'm really bummed about Ramona.

06:18.336 --> 06:20.755
-Yeah, I'm sorry that happened to you.
-[sighs]

06:21.339 --> 06:23.508
So, my parents freaked out
when I told them about her.

06:23.591 --> 06:24.592
They're going to her apartment.

06:24.675 --> 06:26.803
Really? To tell her
she never should've dumped me?

06:27.804 --> 06:31.057
-Sure.
-I love your parents. Your dad's the best.

06:31.432 --> 06:34.185
-[school bell rings]
-You've been out of school a couple days.

06:34.268 --> 06:37.939
-You ready to be here?
-Honestly, everything's been so intense.

06:38.189 --> 06:42.401
There is a talking head in my basement.
Tell you about that later.

06:42.485 --> 06:45.488
I'm actually looking forward to a day
without any life-and-death issues.

06:45.571 --> 06:48.032
Abby, you're here. Thank God.
There is a crisis.

06:48.407 --> 06:50.743
Cindy tore her shorts
while twerking to win this bet,

06:50.827 --> 06:52.578
and now she has nothing to wear to gym.

06:52.662 --> 06:56.249
And Talia definitely has an extra pair,
but she is being a total cunt about it.

06:56.332 --> 06:57.959
Well, Sarah, everything's gonna be fine

06:58.042 --> 07:00.128
'cause I have an extra pair of shorts
in my locker.

07:00.711 --> 07:03.756
Oh, my God.
You are literally saving her life.

07:06.551 --> 07:08.136
Feel like I'm on vacation.

07:10.054 --> 07:12.807
-So, how long have you been like this?
-About three weeks.

07:12.890 --> 07:14.142
[gasps] Same with me.

07:14.225 --> 07:17.395
Great! And what did you do in the days
before you turned?

07:17.478 --> 07:19.522
Maybe there's something
you two have in common.

07:19.772 --> 07:22.775
It was pretty uneventful.
I went to the dry cleaners.

07:23.067 --> 07:25.194
-Me too. Which one?
-Manny's.

07:25.278 --> 07:28.072
Oh, we go to Chazz's.
They're good with denim, and...

07:28.156 --> 07:30.032
-they serve hot dogs.
-What else?

07:30.324 --> 07:31.242
Uh...

07:32.660 --> 07:36.164
I dropped a pumpkin off of a roof
with my cousin.

07:36.581 --> 07:39.167
-What else?
-I saw a cloud

07:39.250 --> 07:42.128
that looked like Charlie Brown,
but my friend didn't think so.

07:42.670 --> 07:44.464
I once saw a cloud
that looked like Snoopy.

07:44.755 --> 07:47.049
-That's fun.
-I don't see this helping.

07:47.758 --> 07:51.679
Come on, Ramona. Where did you go where
you might've been exposed to a virus?

07:52.722 --> 07:56.934
The day before I got sick,
I went to my former job as an auctioneer.

07:57.018 --> 07:59.604
-You were an auctioneer?
-Why? Did you go to an auction?

07:59.687 --> 08:01.814
No, it's just really hard to picture.

08:02.356 --> 08:03.566
I had a natural gift for it.

08:03.649 --> 08:07.445
The high energy, the rapid-fire musicality
of the presentation.

08:07.528 --> 08:09.447
It was very exciting. I hated it.

08:10.031 --> 08:12.700
I always dreamed
of being a slower, duller person,

08:12.783 --> 08:15.786
but was never brave enough
to make it happen, until now.

08:15.870 --> 08:19.248
I always wanted to be bolder,
and now I am.

08:19.499 --> 08:23.127
And Loki was a criminal,
and he wanted to be folk singer.

08:23.211 --> 08:24.712
-And Gary...
-Is an asshole.

08:24.921 --> 08:26.923
Who wants to be a better person.

08:27.381 --> 08:31.594
By dying, we get to be the people
we've always wanted to be.

08:31.677 --> 08:35.139
-I like who I am now.
-Me too.

08:35.223 --> 08:37.433
I don't care how it happened. Why do you?

08:39.310 --> 08:40.728
Because you're eating human flesh,

08:40.811 --> 08:43.689
and I just don't think a lot of people
should be running around doing that.

08:43.773 --> 08:47.151
I used to be high-strung and judgy
like you. You need to relax.

08:47.527 --> 08:50.947
-Sheila, would you like some jogger?
-Where did you get that guy?

08:51.030 --> 08:53.866
Rocky Peak Park.
That's where I get all my joggers.

08:54.534 --> 08:57.328
So, you're the one
that killed the guy there last week.

08:58.746 --> 09:02.833
You left half a body behind. You have
to take all the pieces with you, Ramona.

09:02.917 --> 09:05.711
Otherwise, it attracts attention,
and that's bad for all of us.

09:05.795 --> 09:08.297
But people have so many parts.

09:08.631 --> 09:10.007
I know, it's hard.

09:10.091 --> 09:13.135
I would've been caught a long time ago
if I didn't have Joel to help me.

09:13.219 --> 09:16.847
But you don't have a Joel,
so you have to be a little more careful.

09:18.474 --> 09:19.767
I have a question for you.

09:20.643 --> 09:24.313
-Did you ever throw up a red ball?
-Yes. Wasn't that weird?

09:24.397 --> 09:26.607
-Where do you keep yours?
-In the freezer.

09:27.108 --> 09:28.150
The freezer?

09:29.110 --> 09:30.528
Doesn't it get lonely?

09:32.947 --> 09:33.990
Lonely?

09:42.415 --> 09:45.501
-Oh, my God!
-What the fuckity-fuck is that?

09:45.585 --> 09:47.211
Your ball grew legs?

09:47.295 --> 09:51.007
I left it on a counter for a few days,
and when I came back, it had legs.

09:51.591 --> 09:53.134
I call it "Mr. Ball Legs."

09:56.429 --> 09:57.805
I'm ready to go home.

10:07.690 --> 10:09.483
Ooh, tater tots!

10:09.859 --> 10:12.320
Oh, no, someone touched this one.

10:12.403 --> 10:15.573
-[phone vibrates]
-Ugh, Christian posted about Janie again.

10:17.742 --> 10:18.784
[Abby] What's going on?

10:18.868 --> 10:20.494
It's honestly so sad. Okay.

10:20.578 --> 10:24.165
So, Janie and Christian got into a fight
at Meghan-with-an-H's party, right?

10:24.540 --> 10:26.334
And then he breaks up with her
in front of everyone.

10:26.417 --> 10:29.795
And then he hooks up
with Chess Club Megan in the media room.

10:29.879 --> 10:32.715
Janie sent him, like, a million texts
begging him to take her back,

10:32.798 --> 10:35.134
and now he's posting screenshots
of all her texts online.

10:36.385 --> 10:37.345
[laughter]

10:37.428 --> 10:40.181
Could you imagine?
I mean, I would literally die.

10:42.725 --> 10:44.268
Wow, that's really shitty.

10:44.352 --> 10:46.270
[Sarah] Janie cried yesterday
in history class.

10:46.354 --> 10:47.647
Such a pretty crier.

10:47.730 --> 10:51.317
So pretty. Oh, my God,
he just posted another one.

10:53.152 --> 10:55.655
[laughter]

10:58.783 --> 11:00.284
Someone should do something.

11:01.035 --> 11:03.746
-You're right. I'm gonna unfollow him.
-Totally.

11:07.750 --> 11:11.712
Mr. Whetherton, there's smoke
coming from a trash can outside.

11:12.380 --> 11:13.589
Goddamn it!

11:14.173 --> 11:16.717
Well, thank you for putting
that responsibility on me.

11:19.136 --> 11:20.596
Hey, let me get that for ya.

11:26.894 --> 11:28.979
-Hey, Christian. What's up?
-[groans]

11:43.536 --> 11:44.745
Hey, Janie, how's it going?

11:46.205 --> 11:47.998
Oh, no, someone touched this one.

12:00.010 --> 12:01.429
Yeah, that's not me.

12:03.597 --> 12:05.891
Guess who's here!

12:10.813 --> 12:12.231
Sweetie, that's your cue.

12:18.028 --> 12:20.531
-Ramona?
-Look who couldn't resist

12:20.614 --> 12:22.450
my delicious boy.

12:23.284 --> 12:24.285
Hey, Eric.

12:26.036 --> 12:28.038
Oh, you can kiss in front of me.
It's okay.

12:28.122 --> 12:29.832
Mom. Please.

12:32.042 --> 12:34.378
-Go.
-Oh.

12:34.920 --> 12:36.881
I'll be downstairs with headphones on.

12:37.423 --> 12:38.591
They're noise-canceling.

12:40.301 --> 12:42.011
-All noises.
-Oh, God.

12:45.222 --> 12:47.141
I'm sorry about my mom.

12:47.224 --> 12:49.852
She's a little nervous.
This is a big deal for her.

12:49.935 --> 12:53.814
That's okay.
So, what have you been up to?

12:54.148 --> 12:57.735
Nothin'. I've just been lying here,
successfully throwing a ball up and down.

12:58.736 --> 13:02.156
-What are you doing here?
-I decided I need you back in my life.

13:03.491 --> 13:04.325
Really?

13:05.534 --> 13:08.287
[chuckles] That sounds great!

13:12.750 --> 13:14.502
I may never let you go.

13:15.711 --> 13:18.005
That sounded less great.

13:21.175 --> 13:22.927
There's no legs on my ball.

13:24.053 --> 13:25.221
Or Loki's.

13:25.304 --> 13:27.348
There's gotta be something
in this Serbian book.

13:27.431 --> 13:30.017
You'd think spider monsters
would be worthy of their own chapter.

13:30.100 --> 13:32.269
Maybe I'll defrost my ball
and see what happens.

13:33.270 --> 13:34.355
Do not defrost it.

13:35.481 --> 13:39.068
This was inside of me, Joel.
My body, my ball, my choice.

13:39.818 --> 13:43.322
Please, God, if I win one argument
this year, let it be this one.

13:43.405 --> 13:46.242
Fine, I won't thaw it out.
Unless you keep telling me I can't.

13:47.243 --> 13:50.329
What are we gonna do about Ramona?
We can't have her leaving bodies around.

13:50.412 --> 13:52.581
I know. Do you think we'll have to...?

13:52.957 --> 13:55.167
-I don't want to kill her.
-Good. Me neither.

13:55.251 --> 13:56.752
She's, like, Abby's age.

13:57.086 --> 13:58.462
Plus, she's the only one at that drugstore

13:58.546 --> 14:00.506
who gives a damn
about customer satisfaction.

14:00.589 --> 14:01.715
Maybe we could teach her.

14:01.799 --> 14:04.677
We could have her tag along
when we go kill our first Nazi.

14:04.760 --> 14:07.596
I don't know, honey.
We've got a lot on our plate.

14:07.680 --> 14:10.766
I don't wanna be opening up
a finishing school for the undead.

14:10.849 --> 14:14.061
-[gasps] Whoa!
-Oh, my God!

14:17.398 --> 14:20.484
[Sheila] That knight has Mr. Ball Legs
on his shield.

14:21.277 --> 14:23.696
-[Joel] What does it mean?
-[Sheila] I don't know.

14:24.697 --> 14:28.450
-Is he a knight that fights the undead?
-Or is he an undead knight?

14:29.326 --> 14:30.160
[both] Whoa.

14:30.536 --> 14:32.037
Either way, it's terrifying.

14:32.538 --> 14:35.749
I realize it's not their fault,
but fucking Serbia!

14:35.833 --> 14:39.086
Other than tennis players, has anything
good come out of that country?

14:39.169 --> 14:40.671
-[door opens]
-[Abby] I'm home!

14:44.466 --> 14:45.718
You were doing something.

14:45.801 --> 14:48.012
-I swear to God, every time.
-Mm-mm.

14:48.095 --> 14:51.724
-Hey, Abby, how was school?
-Normal, just like you wanted.

14:52.975 --> 14:56.478
Hey, didn't you guys invite Lisa
for dinner tonight?

14:56.770 --> 14:59.857
You know, to make up for you killing
her husband, and this one eating him?

14:59.940 --> 15:02.484
-Oh, God, we completely forgot!
-We have to cancel.

15:02.568 --> 15:05.613
We can't. This was the dinner to make up
for the last one we canceled.

15:05.696 --> 15:09.283
Mm, if you cancel again, it might look
like you don't know what you're doing.

15:09.366 --> 15:12.912
We know, Abby, we're bad at everything
because we're your parents.

15:12.995 --> 15:15.039
No, it's because prior to this,

15:15.122 --> 15:17.333
you led a mindlessly happy
suburban existence,

15:17.416 --> 15:20.794
which left you fundamentally unprepared
to deal with the life-and-death decisions

15:20.878 --> 15:22.546
that now plague your every waking moment.

15:23.756 --> 15:25.674
-Jesus.
-Don't listen to her.

15:26.342 --> 15:28.636
I'll defrost a frozen lasagna.

15:28.719 --> 15:31.513
Can you go down to the basement
and grab a bottle of wine?

15:31.597 --> 15:33.933
-And a soup from the earthquake kit.
-Okay.

15:34.433 --> 15:37.770
But just sometime,
I'd like one day to go as planned.

15:37.853 --> 15:41.023
Tomorrow, I promise.
All bookshelves, all day.

15:41.106 --> 15:42.358
Sure, tomorrow.

15:44.109 --> 15:46.445
-I'm sorry I broke Dad.
-Oh, it's not your fault.

15:46.528 --> 15:49.114
Between Ramona and Mr. Ball Legs,
he's had a big day.

15:49.198 --> 15:52.034
-Mr. Who Legs?
-Set the table, sweetie.

15:57.831 --> 16:01.710
So... have you and Sheila come
to any conclusions about my future?

16:02.294 --> 16:03.128
Not yet, Gary.

16:08.258 --> 16:11.553
Damn it! All we have is tomato soup.

16:11.637 --> 16:14.139
You can't serve tomato soup with lasagna.

16:14.223 --> 16:15.474
It's just not done!

16:15.724 --> 16:16.892
You all right?

16:17.393 --> 16:19.269
I see a man that needs to talk.

16:19.979 --> 16:20.896
I'm fine.

16:21.313 --> 16:24.066
All I wanted to do the last couple days
was build bookshelves.

16:24.149 --> 16:26.193
But who am I kidding?

16:26.694 --> 16:30.072
With Sheila's situation,
I'm never gonna do normal things again.

16:30.406 --> 16:33.158
Yeah. Her change has had a big effect
on me too.

16:33.659 --> 16:34.576
Ask me how.

16:35.411 --> 16:36.578
No, I see that.

16:36.662 --> 16:40.249
Look, you two are awesome, really.

16:40.332 --> 16:42.584
You listen to each other.
You make decisions together.

16:42.668 --> 16:44.962
I've never had that. I may never have it.

16:45.045 --> 16:47.923
Dude, you don't know that.
You could, uh...

16:50.467 --> 16:54.263
-Anyway, I interrupted you.
-Sure, Sheila's got a lot going on.

16:54.346 --> 16:57.224
Her life's always gonna be bigger
than yours. It's like...

16:57.307 --> 16:59.184
It's like being married
to the Queen of England.

16:59.268 --> 17:02.521
-It's not exactly like that.
-You got two ways of looking at it.

17:03.022 --> 17:05.858
Either it's, "My needs
are always gonna come second"

17:06.275 --> 17:08.569
or "Jesus Christ,
I'm fucking the Queen of England."

17:09.903 --> 17:11.196
Appreciate what you have, buddy.

17:11.530 --> 17:13.741
Stop trying to turn it
into something it's never gonna be.

17:14.700 --> 17:15.659
[doorbell rings]

17:18.037 --> 17:20.039
Thank you,
but we're having dinner guests,

17:20.122 --> 17:22.750
so I gotta put you in the cabinet,
stuff a sock in your mouth.

17:23.208 --> 17:24.209
-Understood.
-Okay.

17:27.337 --> 17:28.756
-Ramona!
-Hi.

17:29.840 --> 17:31.008
Where are Anne and Lisa?

17:31.091 --> 17:33.302
Oh, my mom's finishing making
her famous nine-layer dip,

17:33.385 --> 17:34.470
and Anne had a church thing.

17:34.553 --> 17:37.556
But Ramona's back in my life...
forever!

17:38.557 --> 17:40.726
You guys are together again?

17:41.018 --> 17:44.438
Uh-huh. In fact, Ramona here wants me
to go later with her to kill someone.

17:44.521 --> 17:47.816
-[chuckles] What?
-She said she wants me to be her Joel.

17:47.900 --> 17:49.443
Does that ring any bells for anyone?

17:50.152 --> 17:51.653
-Joel?
-No.

17:52.362 --> 17:55.074
We just went over today and told her
she has to be more careful.

17:55.157 --> 17:58.327
Yeah, and that we realize how much harder
she has it because she's all alone.

17:58.410 --> 18:00.788
And doesn't have anyone to help her
clean up and carry bodies,

18:00.871 --> 18:02.331
like I do for Sheila.

18:02.414 --> 18:05.000
-Okay, I see what happened.
-I hear it too.

18:05.834 --> 18:09.296
-Ramona, you can't just take Eric.
-Why not? He's perfect.

18:09.379 --> 18:11.715
He's little, so if he tries to run,
I can catch him.

18:11.799 --> 18:15.177
Then I'll do something small but memorable
to his legs so he won't try it again.

18:15.260 --> 18:18.430
[chuckles] Hear that, everyone?

18:18.514 --> 18:20.182
Does everyone hear
what's happening right now?

18:20.557 --> 18:22.434
[sighs] Excuse me.

18:22.518 --> 18:24.478
-I need to check on the lasagna.
-I'll come with you.

18:24.561 --> 18:26.021
-No.
-No, you're right. Too many cooks.

18:36.532 --> 18:39.409
-What are you doing?
-I'm fucking the Queen of England!

18:39.493 --> 18:41.078
-[both] What?
-It's an expression.

18:41.161 --> 18:42.621
It means no more looking back.

18:42.704 --> 18:43.914
I'm all in.

18:43.997 --> 18:45.207
I don't know how you got there,

18:45.290 --> 18:47.126
but I dig where you're at.

18:49.962 --> 18:52.548
Hammer-knife's ready.
Let's save the boy.

18:53.298 --> 18:55.592
Okay, Abby, you go to your room
and stay there.

18:55.676 --> 18:59.304
No way! Eric's my friend.
I pushed him into this relationship.

18:59.388 --> 19:01.056
This time, I go with you.

19:04.518 --> 19:07.271
Okay, but if things go south,
you grab Eric and stay behind us.

19:07.354 --> 19:08.564
-You understand?
-Yes.

19:08.647 --> 19:10.065
-Abby.
-I understand.

19:11.108 --> 19:12.109
You guys ready?

19:13.152 --> 19:14.361
-Ready.
-Not quite.

19:26.790 --> 19:28.667
[beeps]

19:31.587 --> 19:32.671
Let's do this.

19:32.754 --> 19:34.715
I was thinking
maybe we'd move to Seattle.

19:35.090 --> 19:38.468
Joel was right. Two people killing
in the same town draws too much attention.

19:39.011 --> 19:41.221
Plus, I love the Seahawks.

19:41.305 --> 19:43.223
Oh, God, you're into sports?

19:43.307 --> 19:45.517
This relationship
is getting even more untenable.

19:47.144 --> 19:48.562
Ramona, we need to talk.

19:49.021 --> 19:52.316
I know how hard it must be for you
to live like this on your own,

19:52.399 --> 19:55.819
but if Eric doesn't want to go with you,
it's not gonna work.

19:56.236 --> 19:57.446
Let me tell you about this guy.

19:58.197 --> 20:00.824
He is not gonna be good at hunting people.

20:01.325 --> 20:03.243
He gets queasy. He's panicky.

20:03.327 --> 20:05.537
-His orthotics squeak when he runs.
-Hey.

20:05.621 --> 20:07.247
-You know I love you, man.
-Really?

20:07.581 --> 20:09.416
Then I'll bite him, and he'll want to
hunt with me.

20:11.335 --> 20:13.212
I'm not leaving without him.

20:14.421 --> 20:15.339
Well, then...

20:16.298 --> 20:17.799
I guess you're not leavin'.

20:25.515 --> 20:26.683
Sorry!

20:26.767 --> 20:30.187
Oh, the seventh layer of my nine-layer dip
is always such an asshole.

20:30.270 --> 20:32.648
It's sour cream, and it always wants
to settle into the olives,

20:32.731 --> 20:33.774
which are layer six.

20:33.857 --> 20:37.361
I used to separate them with pimentos.
I don't know why I stopped doing that.

20:37.444 --> 20:39.905
Oh, right.
Because Dan didn't like pimentos.

20:39.988 --> 20:41.406
God, I do not miss him.

20:41.490 --> 20:43.617
Oh, fuck me, I forgot the chips!

20:43.992 --> 20:45.744
I'm so spacey, and I'm not even high.

20:45.827 --> 20:49.915
By the way, if you are high, that dip
is what you're gonna wanna eat, Joel.

20:50.999 --> 20:51.917
What's going on?

20:52.459 --> 20:56.964
Eric... why aren't you standing
next to your girlfriend?

20:57.047 --> 20:59.091
She's not gonna bite. Oh!

20:59.841 --> 21:02.803
What a cute, weird couple you two make.

21:03.929 --> 21:04.763
I'll be back.

21:12.938 --> 21:14.064
[microwave dings]

21:14.815 --> 21:15.691
Lasagna's done.

21:16.233 --> 21:19.278
-[snarls]
-[grunts]

21:24.950 --> 21:26.743
-[snarling]
-[Abby] No!

21:30.330 --> 21:31.873
-[Eric screams]
-[snarling]

21:43.802 --> 21:45.887
-Abby?
-You wanted me to have a normal life?

21:45.971 --> 21:47.848
This is it. This is who I am now.

21:47.931 --> 21:49.891
I'm the fucking Queen of England.

21:49.975 --> 21:52.436
Okay, that's not the expression.

21:52.519 --> 21:54.896
And tomorrow, we're gonna have a talk
about this whole thing.

21:54.980 --> 21:58.525
-Ramona, it's over. Just give up.
-But I want a Joel!

21:58.608 --> 22:01.862
And not just to hunt with.
I want what you two have.

22:03.572 --> 22:06.116
I don't want to do this alone anymore.

22:07.909 --> 22:09.244
Oh, sweetie.

22:09.328 --> 22:12.914
Well, you can't just grab someone
off the street and have what we have.

22:12.998 --> 22:15.042
-Why not?
-[chuckles]

22:15.417 --> 22:17.836
Because Joel and I built a life together.

22:17.919 --> 22:22.507
We spent 20 years
learning to care for each other.

22:22.591 --> 22:26.428
And lately, I've done nothing
but bring chaos to his life.

22:26.511 --> 22:29.222
And does he complain? Often.

22:29.306 --> 22:33.101
But that's okay 'cause...
he's given up so much for me.

22:34.853 --> 22:36.813
But when you love someone,
that doesn't matter.

22:37.397 --> 22:40.984
Because it's not about what you give up,
it's about what you get.

22:41.068 --> 22:43.236
And I don't complain that much.

22:44.196 --> 22:46.448
So, I guess if I'm gonna find my Joel,

22:46.531 --> 22:50.202
the relationship should be built
on more than just hurting his leg.

22:52.079 --> 22:55.332
-That's right.
-I've got chips!

22:57.459 --> 22:59.795
Oh, my God. What happened?

23:04.049 --> 23:06.885
Ramona broke up with me.
And I am very upset.

23:07.761 --> 23:08.720
[porcelain shatters]

23:10.764 --> 23:14.184
Given the circumstances,
I think we should reschedule dinner.

23:14.267 --> 23:17.646
Which, I think we can all agree,
is different than canceling.

23:21.650 --> 23:24.319
[Ramona's voice]
<i>Dear Eric, I'm moving to Seattle,</i>

23:24.402 --> 23:27.072
<i>where perhaps someday</i>
<i>I will meet my Joel.</i>

23:28.740 --> 23:32.160
<i>I can't take Mr. Ball Legs on a plane</i>
<i>because of 9/11,</i>

23:32.244 --> 23:33.578
<i>so I'm leaving him behind.</i>

23:35.580 --> 23:37.624
<i>Please ask the Hammonds</i>
<i>to take care of him.</i>

23:40.961 --> 23:42.754
<i>I left the key under the mat.</i>

23:45.966 --> 23:49.886
<i>...of my neighbor because it seemed</i>
<i>too obvious to leave it under mine.</i>

23:49.970 --> 23:55.142
<i>Good luck, Eric. X-O-X-O.</i>
<i>Surfing man emoji. Ramona.</i>

23:58.520 --> 24:00.438
Maybe this could be Gary's pet.

24:01.106 --> 24:02.440
So, we're keeping Gary?

24:03.191 --> 24:05.986
It felt good not to kill Ramona.
I like not killing people.

24:06.069 --> 24:08.238
I've always liked it.
I just forgot how much.

24:08.738 --> 24:09.739
You're sweet.

24:10.532 --> 24:13.243
I'll look for a shopping bag
to put this thing in.

24:13.326 --> 24:14.870
Well, now that Ramona's gone,

24:14.953 --> 24:17.330
how are we gonna find out
what killed both of us?

24:17.414 --> 24:18.707
There's gotta be a link.

24:18.957 --> 24:21.209
Are you sure you didn't go to
any auctions?

24:21.293 --> 24:22.961
I think I would remember.

24:23.044 --> 24:26.506
And I can't imagine how something
like this would spread through an auction.

24:26.590 --> 24:29.885
I don't know.
Maybe an infected medieval goblet

24:29.968 --> 24:32.596
or a cursed piece of movie memorabilia?

24:32.679 --> 24:34.347
I didn't go to an auction.

24:36.183 --> 24:37.184
I didn't.

24:39.144 --> 24:43.565
Hon, didn't we eat at Japopo's
two nights before you got sick?

24:43.940 --> 24:46.443
-Yeah.
-Would that have been on a Friday?

24:47.485 --> 24:50.405
-Yeah.
-And didn't you have the clam special?

24:51.406 --> 24:52.866
Yeah. Why?

24:53.450 --> 24:55.202
So did Ramona.
