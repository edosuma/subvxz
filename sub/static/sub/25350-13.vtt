Okay, so what led
up to the homicide?

20:43.176 --> 20:46.844
Napoleon had been committed
to the Lexington Asylum

20:46.846 --> 20:52.850
by a local judge, but he is
released as cured in 1909.

20:52.852 --> 20:56.520
That same year, on August 4,
Napoleon attended

20:56.522 --> 21:00.191
a revival meeting at
Dunnaway Methodist Church,

21:00.193 --> 21:02.159
and that's where this goes down.

21:02.161 --> 21:03.760
So, the homicide,
what happened?

21:03.762 --> 21:05.495
Napoleon was at the church,

21:05.497 --> 21:07.965
there were several
other people there,

21:07.967 --> 21:12.136
a 19 year old fella by the name
of Harvey Ewan,

21:12.138 --> 21:15.706
and also a fella by the name of
Larkin Gibson.

21:15.708 --> 21:17.607
We think that they
may have teased him

21:17.609 --> 21:20.444
or said something
objectionable about his time

21:20.446 --> 21:23.514
in the asylum, and things
went downhill from there.

21:23.516 --> 21:26.750
And we know at some point
Napoleon pulled out a gun

21:26.752 --> 21:28.285
and shots were fired.

21:28.287 --> 21:31.656
Ewan takes a round in the neck
that severs his spine.

21:31.658 --> 21:33.691
He was instantly killed,
would have gone down,

21:33.693 --> 21:35.159
you know, like
a sack of potatoes.

21:35.161 --> 21:38.496
And the other fellow,
Larkin, gets shot in the arm.

21:38.498 --> 21:40.564
All right,
does he get arrested?

21:40.566 --> 21:41.832
Cavari leaves the church,

21:41.834 --> 21:43.768
but turns himself
in the next day.

21:43.770 --> 21:45.436
I assume he goes on trial.

21:45.438 --> 21:47.971
Yes, and what he
says is that Ewan

21:47.973 --> 21:51.374
came at him with a knife,
so he fired in self defense.

21:51.376 --> 21:55.512
And they bought it,
and so he was acquitted.

21:55.514 --> 21:56.847
What happens to this guy?

21:56.849 --> 21:58.382
He stayed in the neighborhood,

Well, on July 30, 1892,
nine boys,

24:03.242 --> 24:06.943
ranging in age from four to
16, met at the Red River.

24:06.945 --> 24:08.112

24:10.249 --> 24:12.349
to a sandbar beach in
the middle of the river,

24:12.351 --> 24:14.118

the catastrophe unfolded.

24:22.561 --> 24:23.961
They lost control of the boat,

24:23.963 --> 24:26.763
then the kids inside the boat
started freaking out,

24:26.765 --> 24:30.434
and the resulting chaos
caused the boat to turn over,

24:30.436 --> 24:33.203

up in the river.

24:33.205 --> 24:34.338

24:34.340 --> 24:36.573
Well, one kid knew how to swim,

24:36.575 --> 24:38.175
so he was able to
grab another kid,

24:38.177 --> 24:40.244

make it to the shore.

24:40.246 --> 24:41.779
Okay, so that's
two that survived.

24:41.781 --> 24:44.314

32:19.571 --> 32:22.972
We argue and fight
and so it's just

32:22.974 --> 32:25.809
with him being so angry it feels

32:25.811 --> 32:29.713

STEVE: So what else?

32:33.785 --> 32:37.988
AMY: I did meet another guy,

32:37.990 --> 32:39.856
but he stays outside.

32:39.858 --> 32:42.125
He is a problem.

32:42.127 --> 32:45.062
I think he owned the
property back, like 1860s

32:45.064 --> 32:47.597
and he looks like
a typical cowboy.

32:47.599 --> 32:49.466
One of the things that
stood out about him

32:49.468 --> 32:51.267
was that he was always
carrying knives.

32:51.269 --> 32:54.738
He was definitely
former military

32:54.740 --> 32:57.274
and he killed a lot of
people when he was alive

32:57.276 --> 33:00.410
but, as he put it,
only because I had to.

33:00.412 --> 33:04.280
Now that he's dead, he's
still killing people.

33:04.282 --> 33:06.282
And it's because he likes it.

33:06.284 --> 33:10.820
He showed me a couple of bodies
and these are his trophies

33:10.822 --> 33:14.224
of people that he's killed
since he's been deceased.

33:14.226 --> 33:18.829
And the way that he can
cause people's deaths

33:18.831 --> 33:22.232
were sudden heart
attack, aneurysms

33:22.234 --> 33:26.703
and other very deadly illnesses.

33:26.705 --> 33:28.238
STEVE: All right,
so you said this guy

33:28.240 --> 33:30.873
causes people to die of
disease on the property.

33:30.875 --> 33:32.976
So I already told you about
Rayburn and Wanda Pittman,

33:32.978 --> 33:34.578
a couple who died in the house.

33:34.580 --> 33:36.112
Long before there
was a house here,

33:36.114 --> 33:38.782
there was another married
couple who died on the property.

33:38.784 --> 33:42.319
Robert and Lena Bush bought
this land back in 1902.

33:42.321 --> 33:48.658
Now in 1939 Lena Bush died
here of stomach cancer.

33:48.660 --> 33:52.062
Same disease as Wanda Pittman.

33:52.064 --> 33:56.466
Ah, I kept having horrible
horrible stomach issues.

33:56.468 --> 34:00.537
And 1945, Robert Bush
died of heart disease.

34:00.539 --> 34:02.839
Here's his death
certificate; he was 81.

34:02.841 --> 34:05.041
So could this
cowboy have anything

34:05.043 --> 34:06.476
to do with these four deaths?

34:06.478 --> 34:09.679
Yes, I think the stomach
cancers and the heart.

34:09.681 --> 34:11.614
I don't know about
the respiratory,

34:11.616 --> 34:13.283

34:13.285 --> 34:16.419
You're blowing my mind, dude.

34:16.421 --> 34:17.587
Now do you think it's something

34:17.589 --> 34:19.155
that he's tryna do to these two?

34:19.157 --> 34:22.358
Yeah...

34:22.360 --> 34:25.095
It scares me actually.

34:25.097 --> 34:27.397
I don't wanna die
at a young age.

34:27.399 --> 34:29.099
So this cowboy's tryna kill 'em.

34:29.101 --> 34:31.701
Any other way he can do it
besides making them sick?

34:31.703 --> 34:33.035
Yes.

34:33.037 --> 34:37.340
I think that he can get
violent with the living.

34:37.342 --> 34:40.443
When I was looking at him
I'm looking up, like OK.

34:40.445 --> 34:44.948
And he flung his arm and hand
at me and it became a knife.

34:44.950 --> 34:47.817
It almost felt like something
was being stabbed there.

34:47.819 --> 34:51.822
He can definitely affect
moods, irritated, angry.

34:51.824 --> 34:55.458
He can probably
influence the living

34:55.460 --> 34:59.395
and make them angry
enough to kill.

34:59.397 --> 35:00.864
So one of the biggest reasons

35:00.866 --> 35:02.065
we were called in by Heather is

35:02.067 --> 35:06.469
because of the rage
that John is expressing.

35:06.471 --> 35:09.339
When I walk in the house, I'm...

35:09.341 --> 35:12.809
I turn into a completely
different person.

35:12.811 --> 35:17.146
The slightest thing will set
me off and I'll start screaming

35:17.148 --> 35:21.484

in the bedroom.

35:21.486 --> 35:25.288
When we first got together
we were happy as can be

35:25.290 --> 35:28.024
but now it's just,
I'm honest to God

35:28.026 --> 35:31.661
I'm so sick of
fighting with him.

35:31.663 --> 35:33.295
I spoke to your

from the land, okay?
