Hmm?

00:39.499 --> 00:41.501
( Cricket laughing )

00:45.255 --> 00:47.167
Oh, hi there.

00:47.167 --> 00:48.468
We're your new neighbors.

00:48.468 --> 00:50.050
My name's Cricket.
Cricket Green.

00:51.722 --> 00:53.513
( groans )

00:53.513 --> 00:55.636
Hey, where ya goin'?

00:55.636 --> 00:57.848
Oh, okay, you're busy.
That's fine.

00:57.848 --> 01:01.181
Hm. Well, stop by any time.

01:01.181 --> 01:03.984
Cricket, what are
ya doin', boy?

01:03.984 --> 01:05.686
Have you lost your mind?

01:05.686 --> 01:07.187
Now, Dad, I can explain.

01:07.187 --> 01:09.149
<i> At first, I was
mowin' the lawn.</i>

01:09.149 --> 01:12.112
-<i> Then, I was mowin'
other lawns.
</i>- MAN: Fore!

01:12.112 --> 01:14.364
<i> Then it just kinda
got out of hand.</i>

01:14.364 --> 01:16.496
Honestly, I don't know
how I made it back here.

01:16.496 --> 01:17.578
Tilly,
ya all right?

01:17.578 --> 01:19.960
I have seen danger...

01:19.960 --> 01:21.702
and I love it.

01:21.702 --> 01:24.204
Listen, kids, I know
it's been difficult

01:24.204 --> 01:26.166
adjustin' to city life,

01:26.166 --> 01:28.088
but we've got neighbors
to consider now.

01:28.088 --> 01:30.170
Oh, hi, Mrs. Lewis.

01:30.170 --> 01:33.383
Clean up your junky
yard, ya hillbilly!

01:33.383 --> 01:36.306
The point is,
folks don't know us yet,

01:36.306 --> 01:38.308
so we wanna make
a good impression.

01:38.308 --> 01:40.270
A good impression.

01:40.270 --> 01:41.982
Dad, consider it done.

01:41.982 --> 01:43.183
Attaboy.

01:43.183 --> 01:44.855
( metallic clanking )

01:44.855 --> 01:46.526
Son, again?

01:46.526 --> 01:48.318
Aw, man, I'm sorry.
My bad.

01:48.318 --> 01:50.691
I was tryin'
to catch a bear.

01:50.691 --> 01:52.532
- Hmm.
- What?

01:52.532 --> 01:55.115
Dad wants us to make
a good impression
around here.

01:55.115 --> 01:57.577
Tilly, what's
the most impressive
thing you can think of?

01:57.577 --> 01:59.740
Uh, chocolate volcano.

01:59.740 --> 02:01.872
No, we need something that
makes your eyes go wide,

02:01.872 --> 02:03.954
and your heart beat fast.

02:03.954 --> 02:06.626
Uh... uh...
a vanilla volcano.

02:06.626 --> 02:08.208
No.

02:10.300 --> 02:13.053
Hmm. We're gonna
launch a chicken

02:13.053 --> 02:14.845
into outer space.

02:14.845 --> 02:16.056
Really?

02:16.056 --> 02:18.258
We are gonna
launch a chicken

02:18.258 --> 02:19.469
into space.

02:19.469 --> 02:20.560
Papa's gonna be thrilled.

02:20.560 --> 02:23.103
We are gonna launch
a chicken

02:23.103 --> 02:27.477
- into outer space!
- Whoo!

02:27.477 --> 02:30.360
( whining )

02:35.325 --> 02:37.778
Initiate launch sequence.

02:43.413 --> 02:46.286
Dang it. We're gonna
need more manpower.

02:46.286 --> 02:47.838
( whistling )

02:47.838 --> 02:49.790
- Hey, kid!
- Hm? Me?

02:49.790 --> 02:52.382
Yeah, you. Wanna help us
launch a chicken into space?

02:52.382 --> 02:54.795
Oh, well, I'm not sure
my parents would approve.

02:54.795 --> 02:58.008
Well, I don't see
your parents around.
You in?

02:58.008 --> 03:01.351
Violin lessons
be darned!

03:01.351 --> 03:04.144
Welcome aboard. I'm Cricket,
and this here's Tilly.

03:04.144 --> 03:06.857
This here's Remy...
I mean, I'm Remy.

03:06.857 --> 03:09.649
We need a better
propulsion system.

03:09.649 --> 03:12.022
Ooh, ooh-ooh,
ooh-ooh, ooh.

03:12.022 --> 03:13.864
Yes, Remy?

03:13.864 --> 03:15.525
What about
a really big
slingshot?

03:15.525 --> 03:17.407
Bingo-bango.
I know just the thing.

03:18.739 --> 03:20.160
Holy cow.

03:20.160 --> 03:22.492
( moos )

03:22.492 --> 03:25.826
( snoring )

03:28.168 --> 03:30.540
Won't your gramma be mad
that we're sneaking
around her room?

03:30.540 --> 03:32.132
No, it's no problem.

03:32.132 --> 03:33.924
Oh, good.

03:33.924 --> 03:35.545
Unless we get caught.
She's got a sword.

03:35.545 --> 03:38.178
- Wait, what?
- I'll stand guard.

03:38.178 --> 03:40.640
( snoring )

03:41.842 --> 03:43.053
Sh!

03:43.053 --> 03:45.265
Sorry. I...

03:45.265 --> 03:47.808
( whimpering )

03:47.808 --> 03:50.400
Ah, Cricket, I broke
your gramma's leg off.

03:50.400 --> 03:53.153
Oh, relax. It's been
broken off for years.

03:53.153 --> 03:55.235
Check it out, Remy.
These'll be perfect.

03:55.235 --> 03:57.317
Nice and stretchy.

03:58.318 --> 04:00.160
My chatchkes.

04:00.160 --> 04:03.453
Show yourselves, bandits!

04:03.453 --> 04:04.534
Gramma, it's just me.

04:04.534 --> 04:07.828
Don't sword me.

04:07.828 --> 04:11.041
Boys, that's two counts
of trespassing.

04:11.041 --> 04:15.335
You two rascals are gonna have
to pay the ultimate price!

04:15.335 --> 04:17.217
What's the ultimate price?

04:17.217 --> 04:19.719
Kisses.

04:19.719 --> 04:21.551
- Oh, Gramma.
- Kisses!

04:24.014 --> 04:25.725
Your little friend, too.

04:25.725 --> 04:27.597
Uh, okay.

04:27.597 --> 04:30.690
A little sugar.
Now get outta here, ya imps!

04:30.690 --> 04:32.773
Here's your leg back.

04:37.237 --> 04:40.400
Okay, so I just
point it towards space, right?

04:40.400 --> 04:42.532
Aim really,
really high.

04:42.532 --> 04:45.405
And tell the chicken
you believe in her.

04:45.405 --> 04:47.117
That's silly,
and I ain't doin' it.

04:47.117 --> 04:48.748
( whispers )
I believe in you.

04:48.748 --> 04:50.500
I hope everyone is watching,

04:50.500 --> 04:52.542
'cause I'm about to launch
a chicken into space.

04:52.542 --> 04:54.174
Pretty impressive.

04:54.174 --> 04:56.756
After the chicken,
can I get a turn?

04:56.756 --> 04:58.969
Tilly,
this is science,
not a ride.

04:58.969 --> 05:01.972
I'll still take a turn.

05:01.972 --> 05:04.054
T minus ten, nine,

05:04.054 --> 05:06.807
eight, seven...

05:08.388 --> 05:10.230
Hey, did anyone see that?

05:10.230 --> 05:12.853
I can't decide between
chicken or fish.

05:17.567 --> 05:18.819
Ooh. Not good.

05:21.031 --> 05:22.943
Hello... oh, boy.

05:22.943 --> 05:24.574
I didn't do nothin',
I swear.

05:24.574 --> 05:26.036
Is this yours?

05:26.036 --> 05:27.617
He thought
it would be fun

05:27.617 --> 05:30.210
to launch a wild animal
into our cafe.

05:30.210 --> 05:31.581
Well, it's not fun.

05:31.581 --> 05:34.044
There was a chicken
in my chicken salad,

05:34.044 --> 05:35.755
and he ate
some of it.

05:35.755 --> 05:38.839
Oh, great.
So now it's a cannibal.

05:38.839 --> 05:40.420
So sorry. I'll--

05:40.420 --> 05:42.632
Keep the animals
on your side of the fence.

05:42.632 --> 05:46.596
That includes
little... what's-his-name.

05:46.596 --> 05:48.598
My name's Cricket.
I'm your new neighbor.

05:50.770 --> 05:53.603
Son, this is exactly
what I'm talkin' about.

05:53.603 --> 05:55.235
For the rest of the day,

05:55.235 --> 05:57.477
I want you to stay
out of sight, in your room.

05:57.477 --> 05:58.778
What? You're jokin'.

05:58.778 --> 06:00.030
I ain't jokin', son.

06:00.030 --> 06:01.821
Just please go to your room.

06:01.821 --> 06:04.444
You're serious?
I can't believe it.

06:04.444 --> 06:06.746
- Mmm.
- All right,
I'm goin'.

06:06.746 --> 06:08.248
I'll give you one last
chance to change--

06:08.248 --> 06:10.580
- Cricket!!
- Right.

06:10.580 --> 06:13.333
Um, excuse me.
Do you want me to go
to Cricket's room as well?

06:13.333 --> 06:15.045
- Mm.
- I'll just go.

06:17.257 --> 06:18.498
Who the heck is that?

06:20.340 --> 06:22.342
REMY: So this is your room.
Hm.

06:22.342 --> 06:24.714
Hmm. It's nice.

06:24.714 --> 06:26.466
Yeah, it's all right.

06:26.466 --> 06:28.178
Hard to sleep at night
with all the traffic noise.

06:28.178 --> 06:29.849
( sighs )

06:29.849 --> 06:32.472
What was I thinkin',
tryin' to launch a chicken

06:32.472 --> 06:34.895
into space?
It's so stupid.

06:34.895 --> 06:36.686
I'm never gonna
impress this city.

06:36.686 --> 06:38.188
I don't think
it's stupid.

06:38.188 --> 06:40.520
I'd never even think
to do something like that.

06:40.520 --> 06:43.523
- Really?
- Yeah.

06:43.523 --> 06:45.485
I mean, I don't know anyone
who owns a raccoon skull.

06:45.485 --> 06:47.697
And is that
a homemade dart board?

06:47.697 --> 06:51.451
And... and... and
you got this thing.

06:51.451 --> 06:54.244
Whoa! Actually,
this is a little scary.

06:54.244 --> 06:57.247
But it's also
pretty dang impressive.

06:57.247 --> 06:59.339
That rocket will give us
plenty of power

06:59.339 --> 07:01.461
to launch
this here chicken
into the great unknown.

07:01.461 --> 07:03.303
- Tilly.
- Huh?

07:03.303 --> 07:06.386
Two things. One,
you gotta stop day sleepin'.

07:06.386 --> 07:09.719
And two, you ready to be
a part of history?

07:09.719 --> 07:11.601
I guess.

07:11.601 --> 07:14.514
But how are we gonna
sneak outta your room
without your dad seeing?

07:16.436 --> 07:18.108
Bingo-bango.

07:18.108 --> 07:19.939
Whoa!
A secret exit.

07:19.939 --> 07:21.861
Doesn't your room
get cold at night?

07:21.861 --> 07:23.153
Oh, very much so.

07:23.153 --> 07:25.195
Go, go, go.
Hurry up.

07:27.117 --> 07:28.948
Okay, let's
do this.

07:30.620 --> 07:31.951
My fellow neighbors,

07:31.951 --> 07:34.624
may I have
your attention, please?

07:34.624 --> 07:37.957
You are about to witness
something you will never forget.

07:37.957 --> 07:39.749
I, Cricket Green,

07:39.749 --> 07:43.383
will launch this chicken
into outer space!

07:43.383 --> 07:45.965
Gather round.
Don't be a stranger.

07:45.965 --> 07:49.299
Mommy, let's go watch
the chicken rocket.

07:49.299 --> 07:51.801
Okay, you, I guess
this is good-bye.

07:51.801 --> 07:54.594
I'll be waitin'
right here for you
when you get back.

07:54.594 --> 07:55.975
Oh, and take these.

07:55.975 --> 07:57.977
For your re-entry.

07:57.977 --> 08:00.940
Remy, initiate
the launch sequence.

08:04.694 --> 08:07.367
You have goggles?
Should I have goggles?

08:09.279 --> 08:11.321
( nervous squawking )

08:14.034 --> 08:15.665
Here comes blastoff.

08:15.665 --> 08:17.617
( cheering )

08:21.621 --> 08:23.623
Well, that was
uneventful.

08:25.295 --> 08:26.676
What the heck
happened?

08:26.676 --> 08:28.218
It must've
been a dud.

08:28.218 --> 08:29.589
All right, everyone,
move on.

08:29.589 --> 08:31.971
There is literally
nothing to see here.

08:31.971 --> 08:33.843
Oh, no,
we're losin' 'em. Plan B!

08:33.843 --> 08:35.805
Come on, girls,
move those chicken legs.

08:35.805 --> 08:37.477
Move, move, move.

08:37.477 --> 08:40.310
We ain't impressin' anyone till
we get a chicken into space.

08:42.232 --> 08:44.734
Ten, nine, oh, heck.
Blastoff!

08:47.317 --> 08:48.448
Huh?

08:48.448 --> 08:50.410
It's not high
enough, Cricket.

08:50.410 --> 08:52.202
We just gotta
keep tryin'.

08:54.704 --> 08:56.456
Cricket, we've
got a problem.

08:56.456 --> 08:57.957
I know.
These dang chickens

08:57.957 --> 09:00.040
can't seem to break free
of the atmosphere.

09:00.040 --> 09:01.541
No. I mean,
well, look.

09:06.336 --> 09:09.049
My eyes!
He's pecking out my eyes!

09:09.049 --> 09:11.091
Just a little higher.
We're almost there.

09:22.732 --> 09:24.104
Oh, my gosh!

09:29.689 --> 09:31.281
Cricket.

09:33.693 --> 09:35.905
Hey, outta chickens.
We'll just have to...

09:39.789 --> 09:42.542
- Hey, come
check this out.
- Cool.

09:47.507 --> 09:49.299
Cricket, you're
stretching it too far.

09:49.299 --> 09:51.551
This is our last chance.
We gotta make it count.

09:53.423 --> 09:55.014
I still believe in you.

10:00.890 --> 10:04.314
Oh, my gosh,
we did it!

10:04.314 --> 10:07.317
Ha ha, we did it!
( laughing )

10:07.317 --> 10:09.068
He actually did it.

10:12.902 --> 10:15.825
Cricket, I told you
to stay in your...

10:15.825 --> 10:17.737
What the heck happened
out here?

10:17.737 --> 10:19.739
We did it, Dad,
just like you asked.

10:19.739 --> 10:21.501
What are you
talkin' about?

10:21.501 --> 10:24.204
What are the neighbors
gonna think?

10:24.204 --> 10:26.085
That was awesome.
You guys are awesome.

10:26.085 --> 10:27.837
See ya tomorrow.

10:27.837 --> 10:29.879
( laughing )

10:29.879 --> 10:31.881
Well, whatever you did,
Cricket,

10:31.881 --> 10:34.884
I guess it made
a good impression.

10:34.884 --> 10:36.716
Next time, try to
cause less damage.

10:36.716 --> 10:38.428
Oh, yeah, we did
pretty good, huh?

10:38.428 --> 10:40.810
I gotcha now.
I gotcha.

10:40.810 --> 10:43.933
Excuse me. May I also
join in the roughhousing?

10:43.933 --> 10:45.935
( all laughing )

10:48.768 --> 10:49.769
( metallic clanking )

10:49.769 --> 10:51.771
DAD:
Oh! Another bear trap?

10:51.771 --> 10:53.693

three times more expensive here,

than family tradition.

where do I start?

the steaks.

-Uh, I'm gonna have
to go with the steaks.

without the steaks!

Can I, Dad?

11:36.816 --> 11:38.738
Hmm...well, all right.

a bunch of time.

took the bomb!

19:17.697 --> 19:19.238
-Get him!
-I'm on it!

19:19.238 --> 19:20.780
[Robot]<i> Pursuing...pursuing...</i>

19:20.780 --> 19:23.412
Y'all keep your eyes peeled
for gators.

19:23.412 --> 19:25.124
They're nature's thieves.

19:25.124 --> 19:26.375
All right, Ma.

19:26.375 --> 19:27.496
[Cricket] Aaah!

19:27.496 --> 19:29.338
Get away from me, robot!

-What in the--
-Go, Cricket!

19:33.713 --> 19:35.554
I got the steaks!
Come on, let's go--

19:38.137 --> 19:39.638
[gasps] No!

19:39.638 --> 19:41.390
-Nice catch.
-Thanks, Carol.

19:41.390 --> 19:43.142
Dispatch, this is Bomb Squad.

19:43.142 --> 19:44.764
The package is secure.

19:44.764 --> 19:46.475
Get those trains
up and running!

19:46.475 --> 19:48.437
[spaghetti Western music]

19:48.437 --> 19:50.359
Let's party.

19:52.481 --> 19:54.363
Aaaah!

19:54.363 --> 19:57.156
Dang robot dance moves!

19:57.156 --> 19:58.657
Cricket, get away
from that thing!

20:03.282 --> 20:05.284
Hey! You can't eat those.

20:05.284 --> 20:07.086
Aaaah!

20:07.086 --> 20:08.287
[crash]

20:08.287 --> 20:09.628
[grunting]

20:09.628 --> 20:11.090
Let go!

20:11.090 --> 20:12.712
We need these
to have our Steak Night!

20:12.712 --> 20:15.464
Cricket, get off the tracks!
It's dangerous!

20:15.464 --> 20:17.046

Bill, take my cane.

[grunting]

20:20.429 --> 20:21.931
Son! Let go!

20:21.931 --> 20:24.343
And ruin our family tradition?
Never!

20:24.343 --> 20:27.306
You said it yourself:
Steaks are the heart
of Steak Night!

20:27.306 --> 20:29.058
[train horn blows]

20:29.058 --> 20:31.150
No, that's wrong!

20:31.150 --> 20:33.352
Steak Night
isn't about the steaks.

20:33.352 --> 20:34.854
It's about family!

20:34.854 --> 20:37.316
We can afford
to buy more steaks.

20:37.316 --> 20:39.488
We can't afford
to buy another Cricket!

20:39.488 --> 20:40.449
I've tried.

20:51.290 --> 20:54.083
Huh. I guess I pressed
the Victory button too soon.

20:54.083 --> 20:56.465
-Oh, well. Dinner?
-Oooh, yeah!

20:56.465 --> 20:58.137
I'm kinda cravin' steaks
for some reason.

20:58.137 --> 20:59.298
Me too!

20:59.298 --> 21:01.340
[all sigh]

21:01.340 --> 21:04.343
Sorry I got so worked up
about a couple of silly steaks.

21:04.343 --> 21:05.935
No need to apologize,
Cricket.

21:05.935 --> 21:07.556
Family traditions are important,

21:07.556 --> 21:09.348
but never more important
than family.

21:09.348 --> 21:11.690
Also, I fought a robot!

21:11.690 --> 21:14.984
Ha ha! Yeah!
That was--
That was crazy.

21:14.984 --> 21:17.857
Okay, now, how about
we head home and order
some takeout?

21:17.857 --> 21:19.738
That won't be necessary, Papa.

21:19.738 --> 21:21.951
The subway has provided.

21:21.951 --> 21:23.612
Bottoms up, family.
