WEBVTT

00:02.000 --> 00:05.000
heartland - 1x03

00:05.000 --> 00:07.500
Uranus

00:07.900 --> 00:09.200
You're dressed up.

00:10.500 --> 00:11.600
Nobody's dying.

00:11.600 --> 00:13.500
Have you got a date
Tonight?

00:14.200 --> 00:16.500
Can I help you, Lynn?

00:17.200 --> 00:20.300
No, I just got an odd case.
30-year-old woman, drunk.

00:20.300 --> 00:21.600
Fell off her balcony.

00:21.600 --> 00:22.900
Anything usable?

00:23.000 --> 00:25.500
Not really.
Liver and kidneys are shot.

00:25.700 --> 00:26.700
Heart's marginal.

00:26.700 --> 00:28.200
You need me for anything?

00:28.600 --> 00:29.500
No.

00:30.200 --> 00:33.600
Is thea still going
On that, uh, school trip?

00:34.200 --> 00:35.100
Yeah.

00:35.400 --> 00:36.700
So you want to go
Get drinks?

00:37.600 --> 00:38.700
Can't.

00:39.700 --> 00:41.600
??

00:43.000 --> 00:49.074
Advertise your product or brand here

01:14.000 --> 01:15.500
Liver gets a bad rap.

01:15.600 --> 01:18.700
It's like the maid
Of the human body.

01:18.800 --> 01:19.400
The maid?

01:19.500 --> 01:22.100
Takes care of all the bullshit
We put into it,

01:22.100 --> 01:23.500
And then it gets blamed

01:23.500 --> 01:25.700
For when it doesn't want
To work anymore.

01:25.700 --> 01:28.500
All that blood rushing through,
Being purified.

01:28.800 --> 01:30.700
Absolves us of our sins.

01:30.700 --> 01:32.700
You're mixing
Your metaphors.

01:33.300 --> 01:35.599
<i>Okay. Well, then,
It's the holy maid.</i>

01:35.600 --> 01:36.800
How about that, huh?

01:37.800 --> 01:39.299
Why don't you tell me
About the patient?

01:39.300 --> 01:41.200
Familial amyloidotic
Polyneuropathy

01:41.300 --> 01:43.300
Caused by genetic mutation.

01:43.300 --> 01:44.000
It's fatal.

01:44.300 --> 01:46.800
Affects the peripheral
And autonomic nervous system,

01:46.800 --> 01:48.099
As well as the heart.

01:48.100 --> 01:49.200
That's good.

01:51.800 --> 01:53.300
Have you done many of these
In Canada?

01:56.900 --> 01:58.100
Sure.

01:58.900 --> 02:00.500
Okay.
Then have at it.

02:10.000 --> 02:11.400
Andrew.

02:11.400 --> 02:12.800
Hi, honey, I'm home.

02:13.200 --> 02:15.100
Ugh. I'll get your slippers
And paper.

02:16.800 --> 02:19.700
Oh, yes. The bovie
Is a powerful instrument.

02:19.700 --> 02:20.900
Yes, it is.

02:23.700 --> 02:25.600
<i>Only actually
When you use it.</i>

02:29.000 --> 02:31.500
Okay. Looks good.
Now the artery.

02:33.100 --> 02:34.300
You know,
It took me three times

02:34.400 --> 02:37.400
And a nice little trip to the
Grenadines before I actually...

02:37.400 --> 02:40.500
Dr. Jonas, we have a bleed.

02:40.600 --> 02:42.700
Suction and keep your eyes
On the cut.

02:42.700 --> 02:43.400
We need suction here.

02:43.400 --> 02:45.200
<i>Need suction here...
here.</i>

02:45.700 --> 02:46.800
How's the pressure?

02:46.800 --> 02:48.800
60 over 45 and dropping.

02:49.100 --> 02:51.700
I can't find it.
Suction.

02:52.100 --> 02:53.000
I can't see it.

02:53.300 --> 02:54.500
Back up, Vancouver.

02:57.200 --> 02:58.900
I said, "back up." clamp.

02:59.600 --> 03:01.600
Give her volume now.
Her heart is empty.

03:01.600 --> 03:02.699
And suction.

03:02.700 --> 03:04.200
Everything is wide open,

03:04.300 --> 03:05.500
And I'm tweaking
The rapid infusion.

03:07.000 --> 03:08.100
Open the internal paddles

03:08.100 --> 03:09.700
And move the defibrillator
Into the room.

03:09.700 --> 03:10.700
Will do.

03:12.600 --> 03:13.400
It's here.

03:15.000 --> 03:15.999
Dr. Jonas,
The liver's here.

03:16.000 --> 03:18.900
No. Send it back.
Are you sure?

03:18.900 --> 03:20.500
Sure I don't want her
To bleed to death.

03:23.000 --> 03:23.900
Take it back.

03:24.800 --> 03:25.700
Take it back!

03:25.700 --> 03:27.800
Suction. This is not a time
To change the canisters.

03:27.800 --> 03:30.500
I need suction.
I can't see.

03:43.800 --> 03:45.000
Is the organ lost?

03:45.600 --> 03:47.000
There was a big bleed.

03:50.700 --> 03:52.700
It was either lose the liver
Or lose her.

03:52.700 --> 03:54.199
It wasn't Dr. Jonas' fault.

03:54.200 --> 03:55.700
I told him I could handle
The bovie.

03:55.700 --> 03:57.400
I take full responsibility.

03:59.500 --> 04:00.700
How is the patient?

04:01.000 --> 04:02.100
Stable.

04:02.300 --> 04:03.800
Blood pressure is normal.

04:04.600 --> 04:05.800
Vitals are steady.

04:05.800 --> 04:07.700
Well, I'm sure her husband
Will be relieved to hear

04:07.700 --> 04:08.699
That she won't die
From the surgery

04:08.700 --> 04:10.300
That didn't save her life.

04:13.200 --> 04:14.600
You want me to deal
With the family?

04:14.800 --> 04:15.600
No.

04:18.399 --> 04:18.608
You, no more surgeries
Until further notice.

04:28.600 --> 04:29.400
Come on.

04:30.000 --> 04:30.500
But...

04:30.600 --> 04:32.199
I said I could take care
Of the family.

04:32.200 --> 04:34.000
I didn't say that you weren't
Coming with me.

04:39.500 --> 04:41.200
I want to be in 123.

04:41.300 --> 04:43.000
And this is not a hotel.

04:43.000 --> 04:44.700
I'm always in 123.

04:44.700 --> 04:46.900
<i>There is somebody in 123.</i>

04:48.000 --> 04:48.499
Who?

04:48.500 --> 04:49.900
Mr. Stottlemyer.

04:50.100 --> 04:51.100
Cf guy?

04:51.700 --> 04:53.000
This room sucks.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.599
Just because you don't get
To scream out

04:54.600 --> 04:56.400
To the nurse's station
Every five minutes.

04:56.400 --> 04:58.100
689.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.400
He'll get it
Thursday night.

05:02.400 --> 05:04.400
Max carey's 80-year-old
Stolen base record.

05:04.800 --> 05:06.500
It's picking up
The little things.

05:07.200 --> 05:08.300
What do you mean?

05:08.300 --> 05:11.199
What max carey used to say
About how to steal a base.

05:11.200 --> 05:13.800
You had to pick up the little
Things about the pitcher.

05:14.500 --> 05:15.500
I like that.

05:18.100 --> 05:19.100
Where's your grandma?

05:19.400 --> 05:20.400
She's on her way.

05:20.900 --> 05:22.500
I got sick at school.

05:22.800 --> 05:25.400
She didn't answer the phone,
So he had to take the bus.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.300
Well, you feel pretty good.

05:32.700 --> 05:34.400
Three bucks says
Marino does it

05:34.400 --> 05:36.400
Thursday night
Against the reds.

05:37.300 --> 05:38.400
That's steep.

05:40.100 --> 05:41.200
But you're on.

05:51.700 --> 05:53.699
Call his grandma.
Run the blood work.

05:53.700 --> 05:55.000
Set up an ekg.

05:57.000 --> 06:00.300
Oh, and, uh...
Move him to 123.

06:10.100 --> 06:12.300
She developed a bleed?

06:12.300 --> 06:15.500
The liver is a very
Vascular organ.

06:15.500 --> 06:18.200
Now, it's not uncommon to face
These type of complications

06:18.300 --> 06:19.500
When trying to remove it.

06:19.800 --> 06:20.900
And her heart?

06:21.700 --> 06:24.500
It's weak.
And she's at risk for an m.i.

06:24.800 --> 06:26.000
If you get another liver...

06:26.000 --> 06:28.100
Then the heart function
Should improve.

06:29.200 --> 06:30.900
Is there another liver?

06:31.300 --> 06:33.200
I wish I could tell you
Something else,

06:33.200 --> 06:34.900
??

06:52.600 --> 06:53.900
She has a brother.

06:55.000 --> 06:56.100
A full sibling?

06:57.500 --> 06:59.599
She didn't want me to tell you
About him, but, uh...

06:59.600 --> 07:01.300
Will he be willing
To donate?

07:02.000 --> 07:02.900
I don't know.

07:02.900 --> 07:05.300
We'll need his phone number
As soon as possible.

07:07.100 --> 07:08.300
He doesn't have a phone.

07:08.300 --> 07:10.100
Well, then,
How do we get ahold of him?

07:11.300 --> 07:12.600
He's in prison?

07:12.900 --> 07:14.800
Yes. Why didn't we know
About this?

07:14.800 --> 07:16.200
Well, she never told us.

07:16.500 --> 07:17.700
You didn't get it
In the history?

07:17.700 --> 07:20.200
You can ask for as much history
As you want,

07:20.200 --> 07:21.900
But if the patient is not
Gonna tell you,

07:21.900 --> 07:23.400
They're just not
Gonna tell you.

07:32.900 --> 07:33.400
What?

07:34.400 --> 07:35.500
You have thea?

07:35.900 --> 07:37.400
Yeah, she's with mary.

07:39.700 --> 07:42.300
So you've heard
About our situation. I have.

07:42.300 --> 07:44.100
And I have to tell you,
I've tried this before.

07:44.400 --> 07:46.100
Every time,
It's either drugs or hiv.

07:46.800 --> 07:49.200
What's the state saying
About inmate participation?

07:49.200 --> 07:50.600
Since he's not
On death row,

07:50.600 --> 07:52.800
Since he's not being offered
Leniency in return.

07:53.200 --> 07:54.100
Is it legal?

07:54.300 --> 07:55.600
This is a long shot,

07:55.600 --> 07:59.300
But if Dr. Grant doesn't object,
I'll order the blood work.

08:00.200 --> 08:01.300
His liver didn't
Kill anybody.

08:04.500 --> 08:05.799
Thea's at
The nurses' station.

08:05.800 --> 08:08.100
Her bus for the spring fling
Leaves at 3:00.

08:13.700 --> 08:15.100
She was all dressed up.

08:26.800 --> 08:29.300
Oh, my gosh. All the pictures on
Roller coasters are like...

08:30.300 --> 08:32.198
Hi, there, sweetie.
I love you.

08:32.200 --> 08:33.900
So much fun.
I can't wait!

08:36.799 --> 08:38.000
Your defenestrator?

08:38.500 --> 08:40.000
She wasn't thrown,
She fell.

08:40.000 --> 08:41.700
County turfed her.
Yeah.

08:44.000 --> 08:45.800
Hey. What's up?

08:45.800 --> 08:47.200
Uh, you're gonna take me
To the bus, right?

08:47.200 --> 08:49.000
Absolutely, but can you hang out
For a few minutes?

08:49.000 --> 08:50.100
I want to talk to mary.

08:50.100 --> 08:51.200
Yeah.

08:52.700 --> 08:55.100
Get Andrew off the cyclosporine.
He's beyond that now.

08:55.100 --> 08:57.099
This is his third time back
Since christmas. I know.

08:57.100 --> 08:59.600
His grandmother just is not up

08:59.600 --> 09:01.499
Start his solu-medrol
Doses low.

09:01.500 --> 09:02.700
I don't want
To burn him out.

09:12.400 --> 09:14.700
Marcus brand doesn't get
Many visitors.

09:15.300 --> 09:17.500
Spends a lot of his time
In solitary.

09:18.400 --> 09:20.300
What exactly did marcus do?

09:21.400 --> 09:22.700
Killed a guy with a brick.

09:37.000 --> 09:39.900
Ms. Armstrong,
This is Marcus Brand.

09:41.700 --> 09:42.600
Hi, Marcus.

09:47.600 --> 09:49.700
I have a few questions
That will help us determine

09:49.700 --> 09:51.200
If you qualify
As a living donor.

09:51.200 --> 09:53.200
Yeah, sure,
Ask me anything.

09:53.500 --> 09:54.900
Have you ever used drugs?

09:55.100 --> 09:56.300
Why?

09:56.500 --> 09:57.499
In order to donate,

09:57.500 --> 10:03.400
You have to be free of diseases
Such as hepatitis or hiv.

10:03.400 --> 10:04.600
I've never done drugs.

10:07.000 --> 10:09.600
You want to take my liver
And give it to my sister?

10:10.400 --> 10:11.700
I can't believe
You can do that.

10:15.100 --> 10:18.100
Have you engaged in intercourse
Since you've been in prison?

10:18.900 --> 10:19.500
No.

10:22.100 --> 10:23.200
How does it work?

10:23.200 --> 10:24.600
How does what work?

10:24.600 --> 10:25.700
The operation.

10:25.700 --> 10:27.800
You're gonna take out all
My liver or just part of it?

10:27.800 --> 10:30.100
If you qualify,
The surgeons take out

10:30.100 --> 10:32.400
About 1/3 of your liver
And give it to your sister.

10:32.400 --> 10:34.900
So I'll walk around with 2/3 of a liver
The rest of my life?

10:34.900 --> 10:37.400
It grows back.
And so will your sister's.

10:37.700 --> 10:38.900
Cool.

10:39.400 --> 10:40.600
Cool, cool.

10:42.800 --> 10:45.100
Have you ever had
Unprotected sex?

10:45.700 --> 10:47.900
A long time ago,
But, uh, I don't...

10:47.900 --> 10:50.900
I don't have aids
Or anything.

10:51.200 --> 10:52.400
Do you mind if I try?

10:53.000 --> 10:55.700
I was a surgical nurse
For years.

10:56.600 --> 10:57.400
Thanks.

11:00.200 --> 11:01.900
So how much time do I get
To spend with my sister?

11:02.000 --> 11:03.700
That's up to the warden.

11:04.300 --> 11:05.800
Look the other way.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.399
I got a niece
That I never met before.

11:10.400 --> 11:12.000
If that's okay
With everybody,

11:12.200 --> 11:13.400
I'd really like to meet
My niece.

11:13.400 --> 11:15.300
If you match,
I'll look into it.

11:18.100 --> 11:19.800
Just keep pressure on it
For a second.

11:20.900 --> 11:22.700
So when these tests
Say that I'm clean,

11:23.100 --> 11:25.100
You're gonna come back,
Right?

11:25.100 --> 11:26.900
If you're clean,
I'll come back.

11:28.700 --> 11:29.400
Cool.

11:33.500 --> 11:34.699
School tp, huh?

11:34.700 --> 11:36.400
Yeah. Six flags.

11:36.500 --> 11:37.400
Never been.

11:37.500 --> 11:38.500
Well, you should go.

11:39.000 --> 11:40.000
What's the point?

11:40.800 --> 11:43.400
I don't know.
Walk around, ride some rides.

11:43.400 --> 11:46.700
Yeah, with that special pass
For cripples and retards.

11:46.900 --> 11:47.800
Fun.

11:50.000 --> 11:52.600
Fine. Whatever.
Don't go.

11:54.800 --> 11:58.200
I called caroline's mom.
She's gonna swing by. You what?

11:59.100 --> 12:00.100
I have to work, honey.

12:00.100 --> 12:01.800
Caroline's mom is gonna
Run you to the bus.

12:11.300 --> 12:13.500
Dr. Grant wants to put in
Another picc line.

12:17.300 --> 12:18.400
I don't need it.

12:18.400 --> 12:20.000
Well, Dr. Grant says you do.

12:22.900 --> 12:24.900
Thea, would you give us
A minute, please?

12:31.200 --> 12:33.200
Andrew, until we figure out
Why you keep rejecting,

12:33.200 --> 12:34.500
We're gonna keep you
On a line.

12:38.600 --> 12:40.200
We've used so many
Of these spots already.

12:45.400 --> 12:47.400
You still think he's gonna
Break it against the reds?

12:47.400 --> 12:48.400
Henderson's a righty,

12:48.400 --> 12:50.300
But the guy has got eyes
In the back of his head.

12:51.400 --> 12:54.100
I mean, henderson's
Putout rate is 64%.

12:54.100 --> 12:56.200
And his windup gives him
A straight shot at second base.

13:01.200 --> 13:02.600
My money's on friday.

13:09.400 --> 13:11.400
Marino does it
Thursday night.

13:13.600 --> 13:14.700
You okay?

13:15.300 --> 13:16.400
Didn't feel a thing.

13:24.700 --> 13:26.700
His grandmother
Still hasn't shown up.

13:27.400 --> 13:29.500
Last december he said he was
Up-to-date on his meds

13:29.500 --> 13:31.200
And not exposed
To anything unusual.

13:31.300 --> 13:33.499
Same in march.
Now this.

13:33.500 --> 13:35.299
If she can't even show up
At the hospital,

13:35.300 --> 13:37.600
How can we trust her
To administer his meds?

13:37.800 --> 13:39.300
The solu-medrol
Should correct this.

13:39.900 --> 13:42.200
Once he's stable, we'll look
Into his home environment.

13:43.000 --> 13:43.900
Thea!

14:04.100 --> 14:05.700
Well, nice dinner.

14:06.100 --> 14:07.500
It's for
Leah kmec's daughter.

14:08.100 --> 14:09.400
You can't give her
All that crap.

14:09.400 --> 14:10.400
It's 9:00 at night.

14:17.700 --> 14:20.300
I've scrubbed in on 100
Of those procedures.

14:20.600 --> 14:22.899
Yeah, I know. The liver
Is a very vascular organ.

14:22.900 --> 14:24.899
Fellows come here
From all over the world.

14:24.900 --> 14:26.599
They think they're the best
In the business.

14:26.600 --> 14:28.500
Then they get to work with
The best in the business...

14:28.500 --> 14:30.000
And they find out
They're ordinary?

14:31.200 --> 14:32.900
Everyone makes mistakes.

14:33.300 --> 14:34.400
Everyone nearly kills
A patient

14:34.500 --> 14:36.000
Or everyone wastes
An organ?

14:36.000 --> 14:37.900
Everyone makes mistakes.

14:39.500 --> 14:40.900
Come on.
Give me a hand.

14:42.500 --> 14:43.500
Give me a hand!

14:46.400 --> 14:50.400
Dr. Grant runs hot and cold
With everybody.

14:51.100 --> 14:52.200
He'll give you another chance.

14:52.900 --> 14:53.900
You just have to
Hang in there.

14:53.900 --> 14:54.900
You don't belong
With him.

15:01.700 --> 15:03.900
<i>two outs with a runner
on first base.</i>

15:05.700 --> 15:07.700
<i>now the big guy
comes up to bat.</i>

15:09.900 --> 15:11.700
Hey, I was listening
To that.

15:15.300 --> 15:16.500
How you doing?

15:16.500 --> 15:19.500
You were right about
The picc line. I feel better.

15:21.800 --> 15:23.800
Jackson's throwing
98 miles an hour.

15:27.000 --> 15:28.600
Let's find a place
To watch this.

15:28.600 --> 15:29.900
<i>winds up for the pitch...</i>

15:36.200 --> 15:37.200
So, how's school going?

15:38.200 --> 15:39.300
Made any friends?

15:39.300 --> 15:40.600
Not really.

15:40.600 --> 15:42.000
Why not?

15:43.400 --> 15:46.200
It doesn't matter.
I don't really need friends.

15:46.700 --> 15:48.800
Oh. No?

15:49.100 --> 15:50.400
<i>you have a lot
Of friends?</i>

15:51.000 --> 15:52.600
<i>Do I have a lot of friends?</i>

15:54.100 --> 15:56.700
What about the, uh,
Transplant olympics?

15:57.100 --> 15:59.400
<i>You have got
To be kidding.</i>

15:59.400 --> 16:00.800
Come on. It's fun.

16:00.800 --> 16:02.500
It's retarded.

16:02.500 --> 16:04.500
They ask me to do
The softball pitch.

16:05.300 --> 16:07.000
"the softball pitch."

16:07.000 --> 16:08.000
So what?

16:08.200 --> 16:11.300
All you do is sit around playing on
Your computer and watching baseball.

16:11.500 --> 16:15.100
<i>What are you doing other than
Operating on people and watching baseball?</i>

16:19.500 --> 16:21.200
Well, we're gonna get you
Out of here.

16:22.300 --> 16:23.800
You shouldn't be just
Watching baseball.

16:23.900 --> 16:25.000
You should be playing it.

16:29.400 --> 16:30.900
687.

16:30.900 --> 16:33.300
Get ready to lose
Those three bucks.

16:33.700 --> 16:35.300
Uh, I think not.

16:44.000 --> 16:45.800
This is fun.
Thanks.

16:52.700 --> 16:54.200
Your brother's a match.

16:55.400 --> 16:56.900
So this is good news.

16:56.900 --> 16:59.400
We can have your brother
Transported here tomorrow,

16:59.700 --> 17:02.200
And also, I got permission
From the warden

17:02.200 --> 17:04.199
For a two-hour visit
Here in your room

17:04.200 --> 17:05.599
Before your surgeries.

17:05.599 --> 17:06.599
No.

17:08.099 --> 17:09.099
Excuse me?

17:09.800 --> 17:10.599
No.

17:12.099 --> 17:13.700
He cannot come
Into this room.

17:15.099 --> 17:15.800
Hey.

17:17.099 --> 17:18.800
You promised
This wouldn't happen.

17:19.300 --> 17:20.200
Leah.

17:20.200 --> 17:21.598
You said I wouldn't have
To see him.

17:21.599 --> 17:24.099
Are you saying you don't
Want the liver? Hold on.

17:24.099 --> 17:27.099
I will not be in the same room
With my brother.

17:27.500 --> 17:30.700
<i>You do understand that he will be
In thee operating room.</i>

17:31.400 --> 17:33.900
You will be recovering
In the same i.c.u.

17:33.900 --> 17:37.300
I will not be in the same room
With my brother.

17:40.400 --> 17:43.100
Her brother killed
Her foster father.

17:43.300 --> 17:45.200
No family would touch her
After that.

17:46.300 --> 17:48.800
Leah ended up in a group home
Until she was 18.

17:49.600 --> 17:51.400
She blames marcus.

17:51.800 --> 17:54.400
She feels like he ruined
Her chances.

17:58.400 --> 17:59.400
Is there anything we can do?

18:03.100 --> 18:03.999
He's a living donor.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.900
Can't he just
Recover upstairs? Vancouver.

18:05.900 --> 18:08.000
We could set a patient room
Up for him,

18:08.000 --> 18:09.200
Bring in some monitors.

18:16.900 --> 18:19.800
Yeah. We can make it work.

18:22.900 --> 18:23.800
Okay.

18:24.200 --> 18:25.500
I'll talk to marcus.

18:26.000 --> 18:27.199
Correct me if I'm wrong,

18:27.200 --> 18:29.000
But I thought you had
A date tonight.

18:30.900 --> 18:32.200
What are you
Talking about?

18:32.200 --> 18:35.800
Oh, well, you know,
The new clothes, the hair.

18:37.200 --> 18:38.500
That obvious?

18:39.100 --> 18:40.600
To a man, yes,

18:40.600 --> 18:43.100
Because we pick up
On these things pretty quick.

18:44.500 --> 18:45.400
Well.

18:45.800 --> 18:46.900
Well?

18:47.800 --> 18:50.100
Uh, he canceled.

18:50.200 --> 18:51.000
Hmm.

18:51.400 --> 18:52.800
So how's it going here
For you?

18:53.100 --> 18:54.900
You know,
So far, so great.

18:56.800 --> 18:57.800
Really?

18:59.200 --> 19:00.700
Yeah.
It's really great.

19:02.400 --> 19:03.300
What?

19:04.200 --> 19:06.300
Just pretty surprised
You came back.

19:06.300 --> 19:08.000
You are? Why?

19:09.900 --> 19:11.300
I thought
You hated it here.

19:12.800 --> 19:14.800
??

19:38.700 --> 19:40.700
So, I-I'm clean, right?

19:41.800 --> 19:42.800
You are clean.

19:42.900 --> 19:44.300
And you are a match.

19:44.600 --> 19:46.800
Did you get permission for me
To visit my sister?

19:47.300 --> 19:48.900
There's a problem
With that.

19:49.100 --> 19:50.300
She still won't see me?

19:54.200 --> 19:55.100
I saved her life.

19:55.100 --> 19:57.099
She has no idea what he would
Have done to her.

19:57.100 --> 19:59.200
We can still arrange
For you to donate.

19:59.200 --> 20:01.000
Oh, she wants me
To save her life again,

20:01.000 --> 20:03.600
But she's too good
To even talk to me?

20:05.200 --> 20:06.400
Is that your decision?

20:09.400 --> 20:11.599
If your only reason
For doing this was to visit your sister,

20:11.600 --> 20:13.300
You should never have
Volunteered.

20:13.300 --> 20:14.100
What do you mean?

20:14.100 --> 20:16.300
A gift like this
Has to be selfless.

20:16.300 --> 20:18.099
But she won't even
Look at me.

20:18.100 --> 20:19.600
You're saving a life.

20:21.900 --> 20:23.300
That should be enough.

20:24.000 --> 20:25.100
Wait!

20:25.400 --> 20:27.300
Wait, stop.
Okay, please.

20:27.300 --> 20:28.300
Just...

20:30.100 --> 20:32.400
Just help me
Understand this, okay?

20:34.800 --> 20:36.000
Just help me.

20:37.700 --> 20:39.100
When someone dies,

20:40.300 --> 20:43.600
I ask their family to consider
Donating their organs.

20:44.800 --> 20:46.200
I don't offer them any money

20:46.200 --> 20:49.700
Or contact with the person
Who receives that gift.

20:51.000 --> 20:53.300
I only offer them
The opportunity

20:53.300 --> 20:55.000
To help someone else live.

20:57.100 --> 20:58.500
It's no different with you.

20:59.300 --> 21:02.600
Only do this
If you can give unselfishly.

21:03.600 --> 21:05.900
Otherwise you'll never get back
What you think you deserve.

21:13.200 --> 21:14.600
Tell my sister...

21:15.100 --> 21:16.500
That I still want
To do this.

21:18.900 --> 21:20.100
See her or not.

21:23.500 --> 21:24.700
I want to do this.

21:51.100 --> 21:52.600
Nurse ?? ?

21:52.600 --> 21:55.200
Can someone please
Help us?

21:55.200 --> 21:56.000
Nurse!

21:56.000 --> 21:57.500
We heard
The first one, joan.

21:57.500 --> 21:59.200
You don't have to page me
10 times.

21:59.200 --> 22:00.500
Grandma, it's okay.

22:00.500 --> 22:01.600
Hey.

22:02.600 --> 22:04.200
<i>Your temp is way up.</i>

22:07.600 --> 22:09.200
Have you been having trouble
With this?

22:09.400 --> 22:10.500
It hurts.

22:10.700 --> 22:12.800
Let me just see
If I can clear the line.

22:14.600 --> 22:17.400
What's wrong with him?
He was fine this morning.

22:17.400 --> 22:18.800
Then all of a sudden...

22:20.200 --> 22:21.999
Maybe his picc line
Isn't in right.

22:22.000 --> 22:23.700
It doesn't feel like
It's blocked.

22:24.200 --> 22:26.400
So, you'll be sedated here
In your room,

22:48.000 --> 22:48.899
Taken to the o.r.,

22:48.900 --> 22:50.700
Then brought back here
To recover.

22:51.400 --> 22:52.899
You'll then return
To the prison hospital

22:52.900 --> 22:54.900
Where a doctor from
St. Jude's will check on you.

22:56.100 --> 22:57.400
Okay.

22:58.600 --> 23:00.400
Okay. I'll see you
In about an hour.

23:00.400 --> 23:01.600
Will you be here
When I wake up?

23:05.000 --> 23:06.099
I know this is scary,

23:06.100 --> 23:09.200
But the doctors here know what
they're doing, and you will be fine.

23:11.500 --> 23:13.300
Is my sister okay?

23:13.300 --> 23:14.500
I think so.

23:15.300 --> 23:16.400
Is she afraid?

23:16.400 --> 23:17.999
She's been through
This before,

23:18.000 --> 23:20.200
But I'm sure she has
Her concerns.

23:23.400 --> 23:24.900
You think that...

23:24.900 --> 23:28.200
Sometimes people who give part
Of themselves away,

23:29.400 --> 23:32.700
Do you think
That they can, um, feel

23:33.000 --> 23:34.400
The people
Who give theirs...

23:34.400 --> 23:36.100
I've seen thousands
Of transplants

23:36.100 --> 23:40.100
And hundreds of meetings between
The living and the survivors of the dead.

23:41.100 --> 23:42.800
They can feel each other,
Can't they?

23:42.800 --> 23:43.900
I think they can.

23:46.400 --> 23:47.400
Okay.

23:49.200 --> 23:50.800
I'm ready to do this now.

23:52.400 --> 23:53.200
Good.

23:54.700 --> 23:55.400
Thank you.

24:02.600 --> 24:04.800
Caroline keckner.

24:05.800 --> 24:06.899
Hey, I wasn't happy
About that.

24:06.900 --> 24:09.800
Caroline keckner.
All hello kitty, all day long.

24:09.800 --> 24:10.999
I thought
They were friends.

24:11.000 --> 24:12.900
Not since the fourth grade.

24:12.900 --> 24:14.600
It was just a ride.

24:14.800 --> 24:18.199
<i>She's a teenager, nathaniel.
Nothing is just anything.</i>

24:18.200 --> 24:19.899
Okay. All right.
I made a mistake.

24:19.900 --> 24:21.400
Andrew's temp is up.

24:22.400 --> 24:23.299
He was fine last night.

24:23.300 --> 24:25.300
His picc line
Might be occluded.

24:25.300 --> 24:26.199
How high is his fever?

24:26.200 --> 24:27.400
It's 101.

24:27.500 --> 24:28.600
Did you flush the line?

24:28.600 --> 24:29.500
I did.

24:29.700 --> 24:30.800
Well, flush it again.

24:30.800 --> 24:33.000
And order the okt3
Just in case we need it.

24:33.000 --> 24:33.800
All right.

24:34.800 --> 24:36.500
Is he in full rejection?
No, he's fine.

24:36.500 --> 24:37.800
It's just his picc line.

24:38.300 --> 24:40.300
I saw the light on
In your office last night.

24:40.900 --> 24:42.000
Late.

24:43.600 --> 24:45.800
What were you doing here?
I thought you had a date.

24:47.600 --> 24:49.399
Thea's back tomorrow night.
You want to pick her up?

24:49.400 --> 24:52.100
Sure. If I can.

24:58.200 --> 24:59.900
Hey, you, um,
You got a minute?

25:00.600 --> 25:01.900
What happened to the diet?

25:01.900 --> 25:02.700
Joan...

25:04.200 --> 25:05.100
Um...

25:06.500 --> 25:11.000
We have some concerns
About your ability to care for andrew.

25:11.200 --> 25:12.700
I don't understand.

25:12.700 --> 25:14.800
Well, we fix him up,
We send him home to you,

25:14.800 --> 25:17.000
And he just keeps coming
Right on back to us.

25:17.800 --> 25:20.599
I give him his medication.
I keep the house clean.

25:20.600 --> 25:22.200
I do everything
You tell me to do.

25:22.200 --> 25:24.400
Then why does he keep
Getting back here? Hey, Joan.

25:24.400 --> 25:25.600
Nice to see you.

25:26.100 --> 25:27.300
Hi.

25:27.500 --> 25:29.600
The diet soda's
Up in pediatric now.

25:40.900 --> 25:42.800
Mary said
You spiked a fever.

25:48.500 --> 25:49.600
You look strange.

25:54.000 --> 25:56.800
I'm concerned
About your heart, andrew.

25:56.800 --> 25:59.599
I'm concerned that we keep
Giving you stronger cocktails of medication,

25:59.600 --> 26:02.000
And I can't seem to control
The rejection.

26:05.400 --> 26:06.500
I'm sorry.

26:06.700 --> 26:08.100
Well, it's not your fault.

26:09.700 --> 26:11.200
I know I'm a burden to you.

26:12.700 --> 26:13.900
To everyone.

26:14.800 --> 26:17.000
Andrew, you are
A remarkable person

26:17.000 --> 26:18.500
And a pleasure to know.

26:18.500 --> 26:20.500
You are in no way a burden.

26:21.200 --> 26:22.900
Now, I'm gonna put you
On some antibiotics

26:22.900 --> 26:24.600
And see if we can't
Bring this fever down.

26:25.400 --> 26:27.600
Dr. Grant?
I need a word.

26:29.500 --> 26:31.200
If I had to tell you
Something...

26:33.100 --> 26:35.500
About my life...

26:36.400 --> 26:39.300
If I told you
Something about... Dr. Grant.

26:44.200 --> 26:47.000
Just take it easy, okay, buddy?
Try and get some rest.

26:47.000 --> 26:48.100
We'll get
This medication going.

26:48.100 --> 26:49.900
We'll have you out of here
For tomorrow's game.

26:54.000 --> 26:56.300
All right.
Thank you.

26:57.100 --> 26:58.700
Leah kmec had an m.i.

26:58.700 --> 26:59.700
How much damage?

26:59.700 --> 27:01.000
We have to reverse
Our approach.

27:01.000 --> 27:02.800
Her heart is worse
Than her liver right now.

27:02.800 --> 27:03.800
I don't agree.

27:03.800 --> 27:05.300
You don't agree?

27:05.300 --> 27:06.799
Her heart function
Isn't that bad.

27:06.800 --> 27:08.699
<i>She won't survive
The operation.</i>

27:08.700 --> 27:10.799
She will. If we go in
And give her a new liver,

27:10.800 --> 27:12.200
Her heart function
Will improve.

27:12.200 --> 27:15.100
She needs a heart more than
She needs a liver right now.
There is no heart!

27:15.600 --> 27:16.600
We have what we have.

27:16.600 --> 27:18.600
We need to go in
And fix the problem.

27:20.200 --> 27:21.300
Just... give her
A little time.

27:22.600 --> 27:25.000
Dr. Grant, please, you've
Performed hundreds of these.

27:25.000 --> 27:27.200
We can do this.
Jonas is right.

27:27.700 --> 27:30.099
We send the donor back,
We wait for a heart.

27:30.100 --> 27:31.600
That's all we do here
Is wait.

27:31.800 --> 27:33.700
This is the job.

27:34.700 --> 27:37.500
You take the patient,
You take the knife,

27:37.500 --> 27:39.500
You take
The responsibility.

27:39.500 --> 27:41.400
But I can't go in there
And fix this

27:41.400 --> 27:42.800
Just to make you
Feel better.

27:58.300 --> 28:00.600
If you have a problem
With what I did,

28:00.600 --> 28:02.200
You don't have to take it
Out on vancouver.

28:02.200 --> 28:03.500
<i>I do have a problem.</i>

28:03.800 --> 28:05.800
So you don't think I should have
Handed him a knife?

28:05.800 --> 28:07.300
You like the result?

28:07.400 --> 28:09.399
I'd rather teach the fellows
That work with me.

28:09.400 --> 28:10.700
Let him stick
To what he knows.

28:11.000 --> 28:12.400
Mistakes make surgeons.

28:12.400 --> 28:15.099
Mistakes of this nature
Are not acceptable, dr. Jonas.

28:15.100 --> 28:18.199
Then why don't we tell
Dr. Griffith to be on his way

28:18.200 --> 28:20.200
Because it seems like you won't
Be giving him a chance again?

28:20.200 --> 28:21.800
Your fellow, your call.

28:21.800 --> 28:24.000
If that's the case,
Then I say when he operates.

28:32.000 --> 28:33.500
We doing the operation now?

28:43.400 --> 28:43.500
Marcus, your sister's heart
Is failing.

28:44.700 --> 28:46.000
Well, what does that mean?

28:46.300 --> 28:48.800
It means she won't survive
The liver transplant.

28:51.100 --> 28:52.800
I don't understand.

28:54.200 --> 28:56.100
She needs a new heart
And a new liver,

28:56.100 --> 28:58.900
And we need to wait for
A donor who can give her both.

29:00.600 --> 29:02.200
I'm so sorry.

29:02.200 --> 29:04.100
They're gonna be taking you
Back to prison.

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
I can't help her this time.

29:11.500 --> 29:12.800
This time?

29:14.700 --> 29:15.699
I protected her last time.

29:15.700 --> 29:17.699
She doesn't believe me,
But I protected her.6

29:17.700 --> 29:20.300
If she dies,
My whole life is a joke!

29:20.600 --> 29:22.200
Do you understand that?

29:23.000 --> 29:24.500
I killed our foster father

29:24.500 --> 29:26.500
Because he was going to
Hurt her!

29:27.600 --> 29:29.000
She didn't believe me.
No one did!

29:29.000 --> 29:30.099
You want to know why
I was so sure?

29:30.100 --> 29:31.300
Marcus, you don't have
To be...

29:31.300 --> 29:33.200
Because he was hurting me!

29:39.900 --> 29:41.800
Does your sister
Know about this?

29:44.100 --> 29:45.900
I never told anybody.

29:48.600 --> 29:49.700
Why?

29:50.000 --> 29:52.900
What's the difference?
Couldn't prove it.

29:56.400 --> 29:59.300
I'd just be the guy
In prison who was raped
By his foster father.

30:16.200 --> 30:17.400
Andrew!

30:17.700 --> 30:19.200
Andrew, you pulled out
Your picc line!

30:22.600 --> 30:24.900
Andrew, andrew,
What have you done?

30:24.900 --> 30:26.300
How long have you
Been doing this?

30:35.900 --> 30:38.700
December 22nd,
March 15th, and now.

30:39.200 --> 30:39.799
Andrew.

30:39.800 --> 30:40.500
I'm sorry.

30:40.500 --> 30:41.900
You have made yourself sick

30:41.900 --> 30:43.700
So you could be here
For christmas,

30:43.700 --> 30:46.200
Your birthday,
And a stolen-base record?

30:49.100 --> 30:50.100
Look, if you're lonely

30:50.100 --> 30:51.500
And you want to be around
Your friends...

30:51.500 --> 30:53.000
I don't have any friends.

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
I'm talking about us...

30:55.300 --> 30:56.400
Here.

30:58.500 --> 31:00.800
You don't have to hurt yourself
To be with us.

31:00.800 --> 31:02.200
Do you understand that?

31:02.200 --> 31:05.900
You can call me anytime if you
Want to watch a game, talk.

31:05.900 --> 31:06.900
Mary too.

31:06.900 --> 31:08.500
It's not just that.

31:10.500 --> 31:11.000
Andrew...

31:11.000 --> 31:12.100
It's everything!

31:13.200 --> 31:15.000
I'm not anything
Unless I'm here.

31:17.100 --> 31:18.400
That's not true.

31:19.300 --> 31:21.300
My whole life I've been sick.

31:23.700 --> 31:25.000
A few months ago,

31:25.000 --> 31:26.600
You give me
A grown-up heart,

31:27.200 --> 31:30.000
And I'm supposed to walk
Into the world and be normal.

31:32.500 --> 31:34.000
At my new high school...

31:36.200 --> 31:37.500
I'm just a mascot,

31:37.500 --> 31:39.200
The kid with the new heart.

31:39.400 --> 31:40.900
That damn poster!

31:45.000 --> 31:47.499
My teachers...
"that a boy, Andrew.

31:47.500 --> 31:49.300
"you walked up
The steps today.

31:49.300 --> 31:52.000
Thataboy, Andrew.
You got yourself dressed."

31:53.800 --> 31:56.300
You are the luckiest person
In the world.

31:59.300 --> 32:00.900
You call this lucky?

32:00.900 --> 32:04.700
You have been given the care
And attention of hundreds of people.

32:04.700 --> 32:07.300
Not to mention that heart
That beats inside your chest.

32:07.300 --> 32:09.400
Think about who gave that
To you.

32:09.400 --> 32:11.200
Show some damn gratitude.

32:13.300 --> 32:15.100
You be grateful, Dr. Grant.

32:15.100 --> 32:16.399
You take the medications,

32:16.400 --> 32:18.400
And you go through
All the surgeries.

32:18.400 --> 32:22.700
These visits to st. Jude's,
You're risking your very life.

32:22.900 --> 32:23.900
<i>To hell with the work we do</i>

32:23.900 --> 32:25.600
And everything that goes
With it.

32:25.700 --> 32:27.900
Andrew,
You are risking your life.

32:30.300 --> 32:31.700
I don't know
What to believe.

32:37.800 --> 32:39.200
He only asked
That I tell you.

32:42.300 --> 32:44.200
I don't know
What to believe.

32:45.900 --> 32:47.399
You know, this isn't...

32:47.400 --> 32:49.100
What I usually do.

32:49.900 --> 32:51.600
I usually bring the gift
To the recipient.

32:51.600 --> 32:53.500
I don't ask them to give one
To the donor.

32:55.100 --> 32:56.300
I don't know.

32:56.500 --> 32:57.500
Your brother wanted to save you.

32:57.500 --> 32:59.200
He didn't want anything
In return.

33:00.600 --> 33:01.499
That's just not true.

33:01.500 --> 33:03.300
Well, what do you think
He wanted?

33:04.500 --> 33:06.500
Your brother has one chance
To see you,

33:06.500 --> 33:07.900
And you are very sick.

33:11.200 --> 33:13.200
Marcus will be here
For another 20 minutes.

33:33.600 --> 33:36.800
I-I met my niece.
I held her on my knee.

33:39.700 --> 33:43.100
What you wanted to do
Was a very beautiful thing.

33:43.500 --> 33:45.100
I hope you know that

33:46.200 --> 33:47.300
You said that some people,

33:47.300 --> 33:50.000
They can feel the dead
When they're inside the living?

33:50.500 --> 33:52.100
I do believe that.

33:52.600 --> 33:53.600
How?

33:55.100 --> 33:58.400
Uh, I think it's more
Of a spirit thing.

33:59.200 --> 34:02.300
It's not like people seeing
With someone else's eyes

34:02.300 --> 34:04.800
Or feeling with
Someone else's heart.

34:04.800 --> 34:08.500
It's more like people carrying
That other person with them.

34:08.699 --> 34:09.800
Come on, Marcus.

34:11.100 --> 34:13.300
I wish I could give my heart
To my sister.

34:13.300 --> 34:15.900
Don't even talk like that,
Marcus. I do.

34:15.900 --> 34:17.899
We're gonna do our best to find
A donor for your sister.

34:17.900 --> 34:18.900
And if you don't?

34:18.900 --> 34:20.300
We will do our best.

34:24.699 --> 34:26.099
The ecmo
Will rest your heart,

34:26.100 --> 34:28.199
But I'm not confident
That it's gonna recover.

34:31.199 --> 34:32.300
If I die...

34:32.300 --> 34:33.800
Andrew.
If I die...

34:36.900 --> 34:39.000
... you can take something
From me and give it away.

34:39.600 --> 34:41.100
You're going to be fine.

34:41.699 --> 34:43.199
I've taken so much.

34:43.400 --> 34:44.600
Give what you can away.

34:44.600 --> 34:47.199
We're gonna put you
Under sedation now, andrew.

34:47.400 --> 34:49.600
When you wake up,
The ecmo will be in.

35:07.000 --> 35:08.300
I'm here, Andrew.

35:29.400 --> 35:30.600
Her heart's viable.

35:32.000 --> 35:33.100
Even after the fall?

35:33.100 --> 35:34.200
Yes.

35:35.300 --> 35:37.200
She's the right blood type
For andrew, so...

35:38.100 --> 35:40.200
So they're
Cross matching her now?

35:40.200 --> 35:41.100
Right.

35:41.600 --> 35:43.300
I'll hear if he gets it
Within the hour.

35:45.300 --> 35:46.400
How is he?

35:48.700 --> 35:50.200
He's a very sick
Little boy.

35:53.300 --> 35:54.100
I'm sorry.

36:06.100 --> 36:07.800
Your mother had a choice.

36:08.300 --> 36:11.700
When she found out
That you had a heart defect,

36:12.200 --> 36:14.200
She had a choice
To either let you die

36:15.100 --> 36:16.300
Or to give you to us.

36:18.800 --> 36:21.500
With you,
Everything was an experiment.

36:22.300 --> 36:25.200
The adult mechanical heart
On the outside of your body...

36:26.700 --> 36:28.700
The size of a small
Kitchen sink.

36:29.700 --> 36:31.900
The first heart transplant
When you were 2.

36:33.900 --> 36:35.700
And no matter how much
We screwed up,

36:36.300 --> 36:38.200
No matter how much
We put you through,

36:41.100 --> 36:43.200
You'd always wake up
And smile at us.

36:45.700 --> 36:47.400
We've been your family.

36:49.300 --> 36:51.400
I'm sorry I didn't realize that
Before now.

36:55.400 --> 36:57.900
Good morning, Dr. Grant.
Good morning, Andrew.

37:03.200 --> 37:04.200
Dr. Grant?

37:07.400 --> 37:09.100
He didn't get the heart.

37:10.500 --> 37:11.600
Oh, god.

37:14.300 --> 37:15.499
He's ventilator dependent.

37:15.500 --> 37:17.700
If we take him off bypass,
He'll die.

37:21.300 --> 37:23.000
I spoke with his grandmother.

37:23.700 --> 37:25.400
She supports what
Andrew said...

37:26.900 --> 37:28.200
Sh About donating.

37:28.300 --> 37:29.500
We're typing him now.

37:33.700 --> 37:36.300
I can't believe
This is happening.

37:37.700 --> 37:39.700
He didn't understand...

37:40.100 --> 37:41.200
The fragility,

37:42.600 --> 37:44.500
Just how fragile
All of this is.

37:48.100 --> 37:49.600
He just didn't understand.

38:02.000 --> 38:03.200
A heart's available.

38:04.500 --> 38:05.800
And a liver.

38:06.600 --> 38:07.700
Thank god.

38:07.800 --> 38:09.999
They're gonna start
The recoveries in a few minutes.

38:10.000 --> 38:12.200
The nurses will come in
And prep you immediately.

38:12.200 --> 38:12.999
Recoveries?

38:13.000 --> 38:14.900
Yes. The separate donors.

38:24.200 --> 38:26.100
You want me to perform
The recovery?

38:26.100 --> 38:28.400
He was my patient.
That's my point.

38:28.400 --> 38:30.900
I've operated on him
15 times.

38:32.500 --> 38:34.200
Then let me assist.

38:34.200 --> 38:37.000
You know you have more valuable
Things to do than that.

38:38.000 --> 38:39.000
I know.

38:39.300 --> 38:40.900
I can handle
This myself.

39:15.800 --> 39:16.700
Is that the heart?

39:18.300 --> 39:23.800
Vancouver,
