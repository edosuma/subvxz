00:54.096 --> 00:56.963
I only came here out of respect
for my parents who...

00:57.849 --> 01:00.010
Knew your family.

01:00.102 --> 01:04.141
Your father was more than just a friend
to my family.

01:07.609 --> 01:09.190
That was a long time ago.

01:10.946 --> 01:11.946
Yes.

01:13.949 --> 01:15.655
A long time.

01:15.742 --> 01:18.199
Thomas Wayne believed in my father.

01:18.287 --> 01:21.700
He believed a man could bring order
to a world of chaos.

01:23.584 --> 01:25.245
And you, Bruce?

01:31.842 --> 01:34.049
I believe in Gotham city.

01:43.895 --> 01:46.227
- You try the vongole?
- Mm. Delicious.

04:53.919 --> 04:55.409
Oh. Hmm.

05:52.435 --> 05:55.017
Master Bruce. Happy Halloween.

05:55.605 --> 05:58.312
- Is there coffee?
- In the study, sir.

06:02.362 --> 06:04.023
A miss Kyle telephoned.

06:04.239 --> 06:07.902
She said she was checking the number
you gave her to make sure it's real.

06:09.828 --> 06:12.365
The gates are open. We haven't
seen a trick-or-treater in years.

06:13.248 --> 06:14.328
We won't see one tonight.

06:14.541 --> 06:16.827
Hardly worth the security risk,
wouldn't you say?

06:16.960 --> 06:18.040
Respectfully, sir,

06:18.378 --> 06:22.496
if our security is dependent
on $600 worth of iron alloy...

06:25.093 --> 06:26.879
This city is fallen, Alfred.

06:30.849 --> 06:34.467
Then we must endeavor
to lift it up again, Bruce.

06:38.356 --> 06:41.393
In the meantime,
we live in obstinate hope.

06:41.484 --> 06:43.600
And an unlocked mansion.

06:44.821 --> 06:45.821
Anyway...

06:46.656 --> 06:48.396
It's an absurd holiday.

06:48.491 --> 06:52.200
Oh, yes.
Putting on costumes and striking fear.

06:52.287 --> 06:54.118
Quite absurd.

06:56.124 --> 06:57.614
Do you really think...

07:00.503 --> 07:02.209
I hate when he does that.

07:10.805 --> 07:11.805
Whoa. Whoa, whoa.

07:11.890 --> 07:13.721
James, babs! No running!

07:17.729 --> 07:20.061
Come on, guys, slow down.
You're gonna hurt yourselves.

07:20.482 --> 07:23.349
They're excited, Jim. Big night.

07:23.944 --> 07:27.152
Yeah. All right.
But we're taking the squad car.

07:27.864 --> 07:29.820
Too many crazies out.

07:30.408 --> 07:31.408
Sir!

07:36.289 --> 07:37.289
Hang on.

07:44.881 --> 07:46.337
Now, you're ready.

07:47.676 --> 07:49.758
All right, who wants to drive?

07:51.972 --> 07:52.972
Jim!

07:57.268 --> 07:58.668
Just joking.

08:04.359 --> 08:05.359
Hey, hey, hang on.

08:06.569 --> 08:09.151
It could be a wrong number,
or a crank call or...

08:11.825 --> 08:12.825
Gordon.

08:13.868 --> 08:15.074
Uh-huh...

08:15.996 --> 08:16.996
When?

08:17.330 --> 08:19.571
All right. I'm on my way.

08:22.460 --> 08:24.291
Your father's captain now.

08:24.462 --> 08:26.669
The whole department's counting on him.

08:28.216 --> 08:30.172
Well, I was counting on him, too.

08:38.643 --> 08:39.849
I'll try and be quick.

08:58.163 --> 08:59.163
Hello?

09:12.260 --> 09:13.796
Gilda, there you are.

09:15.472 --> 09:16.472
What?

09:18.224 --> 09:19.224
Harvey.

09:19.726 --> 09:21.887
- You're home.
- Better late than never.

09:23.104 --> 09:24.719
Why are you hiding out here in the cold?

09:24.814 --> 09:27.556
I know. I'm sorry, I just...

09:31.237 --> 09:33.068
Mm, you started without me.

09:35.450 --> 09:36.565
Did you have any kids?

09:38.661 --> 09:39.661
What?

09:41.206 --> 09:42.206
Trick-or-treaters.

09:43.833 --> 09:47.576
Oh, no. I don't... no. I just...

09:48.296 --> 09:51.413
I don't think I'm really up
for all that tonight.

09:51.508 --> 09:53.373
Answering the door every five minutes...

09:54.302 --> 09:55.302
Smiling.

09:55.428 --> 09:57.885
Yeah, I saw the bowl on the porch.

09:57.972 --> 10:00.133
It's okay. It's a ghost town out there.

10:00.225 --> 10:01.590
So to speak.

10:01.684 --> 10:03.444
We're gonna be eating
that candy for a month.

10:08.525 --> 10:09.389
Or not.

10:09.484 --> 10:12.226
You know I have a love-hate
relationship with candy.

10:12.320 --> 10:15.357
You have a love-hate
relationship with everything.

10:22.205 --> 10:24.116
Let's just crawl into bed

10:24.207 --> 10:26.118
and watch an old
black and white movie on...

10:26.209 --> 10:27.369
Baby, I'm so sorry.

10:32.841 --> 10:34.297
You have to go.

10:34.384 --> 10:36.625
Pick a movie. I'll be back soon.

10:38.012 --> 10:39.012
I love you.

11:03.621 --> 11:06.112
Does he always keep you
waiting like this?

11:06.666 --> 11:07.746
He'll be here.

11:09.544 --> 11:10.784
I thought you quit.

11:11.838 --> 11:13.078
I have.

11:13.756 --> 11:16.293
Hmm. Don't worry, I won't tell Barbara.

11:16.384 --> 11:17.999
Gentlemen.

11:22.974 --> 11:23.804
Ah. Good.

11:23.892 --> 11:25.382
This is district attorney Harvey d...

11:25.476 --> 11:26.761
Bats.

11:27.562 --> 11:28.562
Dent.

11:30.440 --> 11:31.475
Okay.

11:33.443 --> 11:34.649
What's happened?

11:34.986 --> 11:37.102
Johnny viti was murdered tonight.

11:38.448 --> 11:39.448
Damn it!

11:39.991 --> 11:41.111
The Roman's nephew.

11:41.159 --> 11:42.274
He has a name.

11:42.410 --> 11:44.241
It's carmine Falcone, not "the Roman."

11:44.329 --> 11:45.159
Harvey, calm down.

11:45.246 --> 11:48.238
Where were your men, Jim?
I've been working on viti for months!

11:48.458 --> 11:50.449
Nobody on your team thought
he'd be vulnerable

11:50.543 --> 11:53.000
the night before he's gonna
turn state's evidence?

11:56.382 --> 11:58.589
22 caliber, taped handle,

11:59.052 --> 12:00.667
serial number filed off.

12:00.762 --> 12:04.095
Baby bottle nipple
for a silencer. Odd, but effective.

12:04.515 --> 12:05.675
And untraceable.

12:05.850 --> 12:07.661
Hard to tell if we're dealing
with a professional.

12:07.685 --> 12:09.266
Of course it was a professional!

12:09.395 --> 12:10.555
This was Falcone!

12:10.813 --> 12:13.145
He found out viti
was gonna betray the family,

12:13.316 --> 12:15.352
so he took him off the board!

12:15.860 --> 12:16.860
Maybe.

12:19.530 --> 12:21.020
We were so close.

12:22.158 --> 12:24.524
We were so close, Jim.

12:24.619 --> 12:26.405
He was ready to sing.

12:26.496 --> 12:29.363
And not just about carmine,
the whole family was going away.

12:29.457 --> 12:31.994
We had a real opportunity
to change things.

12:32.210 --> 12:35.122
We still do. It's just a setback.

12:35.213 --> 12:37.329
We'll find another way
to take down Falcone.

12:37.423 --> 12:38.423
Together.

12:39.050 --> 12:41.086
Where's the Jack-o'-lantern?

12:41.177 --> 12:42.292
Excuse me?

12:46.224 --> 12:47.760
You think it's important?

12:48.142 --> 12:49.598
I don't know yet.

12:49.686 --> 12:51.517
Look, Harvey's right.

12:52.605 --> 12:54.641
This city's finally got a chance.

12:54.732 --> 12:57.974
And it's the three men
standing here right now.

12:58.486 --> 13:01.193
The Falcone crime family
has to be taken down.

13:01.281 --> 13:03.488
So, I'm putting you two together.

13:03.574 --> 13:06.407
District attorney dent
will work in the light, and you...

13:07.578 --> 13:09.739
Will work the other side.

13:10.039 --> 13:12.701
Bend the rules, but never break them.

13:12.792 --> 13:15.249
And I'll do everything
I can to protect you both.

13:16.170 --> 13:17.831
Understood.

13:23.469 --> 13:25.300
He needs
to hear you say it, bats.

13:26.306 --> 13:28.797
Two heads are better than one.

13:37.317 --> 13:39.023
Leads come my way pretty fast.

13:39.569 --> 13:41.355
Keep your ears open.

13:41.946 --> 13:43.066
Then I guess we're up and...

13:44.574 --> 13:45.574
Running.

13:46.659 --> 13:48.866
He does that a lot. I just...

13:51.289 --> 13:53.245
And I'm talking to myself.

14:31.245 --> 14:32.245
Godfather.

14:32.622 --> 14:35.489
I'm so sorry to hear about your nephew.

14:35.917 --> 14:37.248
Grazie, amico.

14:38.503 --> 14:39.503
Carmine,

14:39.712 --> 14:40.952
no disrespect

14:41.047 --> 14:43.504
but why are we sitting
on our hands here, huh?

14:43.800 --> 14:45.415
He put two in Johnny's head!

14:46.010 --> 14:47.010
Who did?

14:47.053 --> 14:49.385
Salvatore maroni! Who else?

14:49.472 --> 14:52.509
Ever since he took over that family,
he's been gunning for us,

14:52.600 --> 14:54.716
and tonight he found the target.

14:54.811 --> 14:56.847
It's a warning, for chrissakes!

14:58.106 --> 14:59.106
Perhaps.

14:59.899 --> 15:01.810
But let us be clear.

15:02.693 --> 15:05.901
The man who pulled the trigger
did not load the gun.

15:06.114 --> 15:10.483
Maroni's ambition was in check
until the law put a target on my back.

15:11.411 --> 15:13.993
Now, it's open season.

15:14.580 --> 15:17.162
If anyone is responsible
for my nephew's death,

15:17.792 --> 15:20.579
it's that new son of a bitch
in the da's office.

15:21.379 --> 15:22.379
Dent.

15:25.133 --> 15:28.125
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.
- Maybe he should sleep with the fishes.

15:28.886 --> 15:29.796
Hell yes!

15:29.887 --> 15:32.799
You just say the word, carmine,
and I'll do dent myself!

15:34.851 --> 15:35.966
Settle, antoni.

15:36.769 --> 15:39.385
At the right time, we'll hit back.
Until then...

15:39.480 --> 15:41.562
The right time is now, carmine!

15:41.649 --> 15:45.062
Now! Any delay is only gonna
make you look even weaker!

15:51.451 --> 15:53.783
Thank you for your concern, antoni.

15:57.373 --> 15:59.409
No disrespect, carmine.

16:04.046 --> 16:06.037
It's "godfather."

16:06.507 --> 16:08.247
Milos. Come on!

16:10.136 --> 16:11.136
Please!

16:14.223 --> 16:15.223
Milos! No!

16:15.558 --> 16:16.558
Nol

16:34.285 --> 16:36.071
We have other business to discuss?

16:38.664 --> 16:39.664
Alberto?

16:41.375 --> 16:42.375
Alberto!

16:44.795 --> 16:46.331
Business time.

16:46.422 --> 16:48.003
Take your crosswords for a walk.

16:49.842 --> 16:52.208
They're... logic puzzles.

16:54.555 --> 16:56.921
Thirty-two going on 13.

17:02.021 --> 17:05.730
Wayne is not gonna support
any large-scale structuring effort.

17:05.816 --> 17:10.651
So, for now, the assets will have to be
moved to a more secure facility.

18:01.247 --> 18:02.987
Your equipment's weighing you down.

18:03.457 --> 18:04.822
Why are you running?

18:04.959 --> 18:08.622
Fun. You could use a little fun.

18:47.668 --> 18:48.668
Give me your hand.

18:50.796 --> 18:51.796
Nah.

19:38.678 --> 19:40.669
Got you exactly where I want you.

19:44.517 --> 19:46.098
Falcone.

19:47.144 --> 19:48.554
Walt till you see what's inside.

19:59.240 --> 20:00.946
Mm...

20:01.033 --> 20:03.274
Have you ever seen this kind of money?

20:04.912 --> 20:05.912
It's authentic.

20:08.791 --> 20:11.624
So crisp and clean.

20:12.002 --> 20:13.742
Actually, it's incredibly dirty.

20:13.838 --> 20:16.545
Falcone's been having trouble
laundering his cash for some time.

20:16.924 --> 20:19.381
We just didn't know
where he was stockpiling it.

20:22.930 --> 20:23.965
Thank you.

20:24.598 --> 20:26.008
I'm happy to help.

20:26.684 --> 20:27.844
Why?

20:31.605 --> 20:33.311
You could have kept it to yourself.

20:33.399 --> 20:35.264
You could have lived
pretty well with all this.

20:35.776 --> 20:36.776
Why hand it over?

20:37.653 --> 20:38.653
To you?

20:46.787 --> 20:47.787
Who knows?

21:01.260 --> 21:02.260
Get down!

21:06.056 --> 21:07.091
Take it from me, pal,

21:07.183 --> 21:10.050
around here,
curiosity can get you killed.

21:10.144 --> 21:11.054
Let him go.

21:11.145 --> 21:12.601
What? Why?

21:12.688 --> 21:13.688
Because he's with me.

21:15.858 --> 21:19.521
Also, because he's the da
who put all your friends into arkham.

21:20.279 --> 21:22.361
We got room for one more.

21:28.913 --> 21:30.028
Anyone follow us?

21:30.456 --> 21:31.696
I could barely follow us.

21:39.965 --> 21:42.832
Falcone imports has been doing
quite a business.

21:50.226 --> 21:53.343
You know, if we were any other men...

21:53.437 --> 21:54.437
We're not.

21:55.856 --> 21:57.812
Yeah. No. Of course.

22:00.444 --> 22:01.650
So, what now?

22:01.737 --> 22:03.318
We should call Gordon.

22:03.405 --> 22:06.067
Have his men pick this up as evidence.

22:06.867 --> 22:09.825
Falcone owns the mayor
and the entire city assembly.

22:09.912 --> 22:11.698
It'd be back in his coffers by tomorrow.

22:12.915 --> 22:16.453
So, the only way to make
an impact is to make it disappear.

22:16.627 --> 22:19.585
Yeah, but look at all this.
Moving it could take days.

22:23.217 --> 22:25.253
Well, who said anything about moving it?

22:29.682 --> 22:31.172
Why are you trying to hurt Falcone?

22:32.309 --> 22:34.049
Why are you?

22:34.353 --> 22:37.095
It's not personal, sweetheart.
It's justice.

22:37.690 --> 22:40.773
Justice can be personal, sweetie.

22:42.862 --> 22:44.193
Give me a head start.

22:44.280 --> 22:46.191
I don't want to get caught
anywhere near here.

22:46.657 --> 22:48.318
I don't know.

22:48.409 --> 22:50.209
Gordon says
I'm supposed to work in the light.

22:50.494 --> 22:51.859
Well, then, light it up.

22:56.500 --> 22:57.580
I owe you one.

22:59.837 --> 23:01.077
You owe me, like...

23:01.964 --> 23:03.579
A billion-five.

23:13.726 --> 23:16.342
I can't really be a lawyer
and a criminal, can I?

23:17.605 --> 23:19.095
I want to win.

23:20.190 --> 23:21.976
But do I want to win like this?

23:23.277 --> 23:25.359
I'm of two minds here.

23:26.614 --> 23:28.195
So, it's a coin flip.

23:31.410 --> 23:33.401
Yeah, I guess it is.

23:33.662 --> 23:35.152
Heads, we burn it down.

23:37.166 --> 23:38.246
Okay.

23:55.851 --> 23:56.851
Call chen.

24:00.856 --> 24:03.543
Firefighters on the scene
here in the industrial district

24:03.567 --> 24:04.932
working to contain the Blaze

24:05.027 --> 24:07.689
before it can spread
to nearby homes and businesses.

24:08.072 --> 24:09.437
Now, at this time, Jackie,

24:09.531 --> 24:12.773
officials believe
the Falcone imports warehouse,

24:12.910 --> 24:15.447
owned, of course,
by the notorious Falcone crime family,

24:15.537 --> 24:16.537
to be vacant...

24:34.723 --> 24:36.338
"Two heads are better than one."

24:47.653 --> 24:48.653
Gilda?

24:51.991 --> 24:53.276
Gilda?

25:07.047 --> 25:08.503
Hey! You scared me.

25:09.508 --> 25:11.339
I came home
and I didn't know where you were.

25:11.510 --> 25:12.625
Did you hear me calling?

25:14.013 --> 25:15.594
Please stay.

25:16.724 --> 25:17.884
I'm not going anywhere.

25:18.267 --> 25:20.633
I mean it. Don't leave me.

25:21.437 --> 25:24.429
Baby, I know I haven't been around.
And I'm sorry.

25:24.523 --> 25:25.638
But this job...

25:26.483 --> 25:27.563
It isn't forever.

25:33.657 --> 25:36.615
Hey, we caught a huge break tonight
on this Falcone thing.

25:37.453 --> 25:40.411
Once I take him out,
and I will take him out,

25:41.707 --> 25:42.947
things are gonna be different.

25:43.876 --> 25:45.207
We can start a family.

25:48.422 --> 25:49.502
You know I can't.

25:50.549 --> 25:53.291
Of course you can. We can.

25:53.385 --> 25:55.216
We'll talk about options
when you're ready,

25:55.679 --> 25:57.761
but I need you to trust
that we're still on track.

25:58.599 --> 26:00.385
And that I love you.

26:03.479 --> 26:05.390
Now, are we still having
movie night, or not?

26:07.149 --> 26:08.935
No, don't even answer that. Come on.

26:54.947 --> 26:57.689
If we take 66th, we can cut them off
at the westward bridge.

26:57.783 --> 27:00.365
No. Maintain a safe distance for now.

27:24.685 --> 27:26.767
Good evening, sir.
The Turkey is roasting,

27:26.895 --> 27:30.479
the pies are cooling,
and miss Kyle is en route.

27:36.488 --> 27:38.695
Alfred, make a note
to order a new windshield.

27:38.949 --> 27:39.949
Bulletproof.

27:40.117 --> 27:42.073
Of course, sir, but if I may...

28:34.087 --> 28:35.087
Aah!

28:46.266 --> 28:48.302
I thought
you didn't hurt people!

28:52.314 --> 28:53.474
You thought wrong.

28:56.068 --> 28:57.854
You and your San ho hui buddies

28:57.945 --> 29:00.527
were seen outside Harvey dent's house
on Halloween.

29:01.114 --> 29:02.354
We were trick-or-treating.

29:05.869 --> 29:06.869
Having fun?

29:07.663 --> 29:09.153
Not yet.

29:09.248 --> 29:11.159
But any second now.

29:43.532 --> 29:44.532
Yeah!

31:53.245 --> 31:56.487
Go. I'll keep an eye
on your little friends.

31:58.500 --> 32:00.365
A "thank you" would be nice!

32:02.963 --> 32:04.373
It is Thanksgiving.

32:14.933 --> 32:16.594
We can make this easy, Mickey.

32:17.519 --> 32:19.601
Just tell me who hired you to kill dent.

32:19.688 --> 32:21.019
Go to hell, bat-freak!

32:23.650 --> 32:26.437
Right now, the only difference
between you and me

32:26.528 --> 32:28.519
is that I know what's down here.

32:34.744 --> 32:35.904
Hmm.

32:48.091 --> 32:49.091
Grundy.

32:50.927 --> 32:51.962
He's mine.

32:52.637 --> 32:53.637
Let him go.

32:57.809 --> 32:59.515
This is your place.

32:59.603 --> 33:02.686
Give him to me and I'll make sure
he never sets foot down here again.

33:06.318 --> 33:08.354
You can be alone.

33:27.923 --> 33:31.632
Born on a Monday.

33:43.522 --> 33:44.807
One more for ya.

33:45.607 --> 33:46.607
My goodness.

33:50.779 --> 33:53.896
Oh, this one's not for your husband.
It's for you.

33:56.243 --> 33:58.609
From a "Mr. Falcone."

34:03.542 --> 34:04.873
I'm sorry, ma'am.

34:04.960 --> 34:06.880
It's none of my business...

34:06.920 --> 34:08.831
Isn't it time for his dinner?

34:18.056 --> 34:19.795
I don't wanna be here, Mick.

34:21.393 --> 34:23.634
My wife's cooking Turkey
with all the trimmings.

34:24.771 --> 34:26.762
I love Turkey with all the trimmings.

34:28.358 --> 34:30.223
So, just tell us what you know

34:30.318 --> 34:32.228
about the bomb
in the district attorney's house,

34:32.320 --> 34:33.810
then we can all go eat.

34:35.447 --> 34:37.734
I don't even know carmine Falcone.

34:39.703 --> 34:43.491
The Roman contracted your triad
to take out Harvey dent!

34:43.581 --> 34:45.413
Your signature's all over it.

34:45.500 --> 34:49.243
Mickey, you gotta help me
keep my friend here calm.

34:49.337 --> 34:50.577
Just give us something...

34:51.255 --> 34:52.255
Anything.

34:53.967 --> 34:55.797
Someone's trying to frame me.

34:55.885 --> 34:58.376
I told you. I'm innocent.

34:59.180 --> 35:00.795
Chairs are for suspects.

35:00.890 --> 35:02.255
This guy's innocent.

35:06.271 --> 35:07.386
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

35:08.023 --> 35:10.730
Hey. I thought we were
just doing a thing.

35:10.859 --> 35:13.521
This little act doesn't get us anywhere
if the guy gets hurt.

35:13.612 --> 35:16.399
Maybe you guys should admit
you have nothing on San ho hui.

35:16.823 --> 35:19.485
If you had,
you would've booked me already.

35:20.535 --> 35:22.617
All right. That's it. Montoya!

35:24.039 --> 35:26.621
Please, show our friend out.

35:27.000 --> 35:29.537
Maybe you should thank
whoever planted that bomb.

35:30.503 --> 35:31.503
What did you say?

35:31.588 --> 35:34.455
You still haven't figured out
who killed Johnny viti?

35:36.593 --> 35:38.504
Get him outta my sight.

35:43.767 --> 35:45.223
You may be aces in a fistfight,

35:45.310 --> 35:47.926
but you've got a lot to learn
about detective work.

35:48.313 --> 35:49.678
I found him, didn't I?

35:49.773 --> 35:51.434
It's not just about finding them.

35:51.524 --> 35:53.731
You gotta know how
they're gonna help your case.

35:53.818 --> 35:56.981
Mickey chen is a small fish
protected by Falcone.

35:57.822 --> 35:59.983
We were never going to get a confession.

36:00.158 --> 36:03.321
We needed to make friends
and, in time, flip him.

36:04.037 --> 36:06.278
Keep talking like that,
they'll make you da.

36:06.873 --> 36:08.329
Harvey isn't dead yet.

36:09.292 --> 36:10.873
And he isn't a killer, either.

36:10.960 --> 36:12.791
No matter what that scumbag thinks.

36:13.713 --> 36:15.704
He's never even owned a gun.

36:15.799 --> 36:17.460
Falcone fits.

36:17.550 --> 36:20.462
The Roman killed viti
and ordered the hit on dent.

36:20.553 --> 36:21.553
Occam's razor.

36:22.472 --> 36:25.635
The simplest explanation
is usually the right one.

36:26.351 --> 36:28.808
All right. If I leave now,
I might just make dinner.

36:31.398 --> 36:32.888
You should be with your people, too.

36:37.654 --> 36:38.654
Fine.

36:46.579 --> 36:47.739
Good night.

36:47.831 --> 36:49.571
Happy Thanksgiving, Mrs. dent.

36:51.292 --> 36:54.534
Now, I'm sure the missus is running out
to pick up some real food,

36:54.629 --> 36:57.962
but I guarantee you, you have
never had pumpkin pie like...

37:01.052 --> 37:02.633
Uh, Mr. dent?

37:10.437 --> 37:13.053
I just, you know, wanna get out
of the city, I hate this place.

37:13.148 --> 37:14.148
Nice.

37:22.198 --> 37:23.779
The secret is the basil.

37:23.867 --> 37:27.109
You want only the youngest leaves
from the youngest plant,

37:27.203 --> 37:28.943
otherwise, it's like mint.

37:31.124 --> 37:32.364
Overpowers everything.

37:33.042 --> 37:35.579
We have a lot
to be thankful for, Alberto.

37:35.670 --> 37:36.876
Such as?

37:37.839 --> 37:39.670
Health. Family.

37:40.675 --> 37:41.835
What's left of it.

37:43.261 --> 37:46.048
If you are referring
to your cousin Johnny,

37:46.139 --> 37:47.424
that is being handled.

37:47.807 --> 37:49.468
By Mickey chen.

37:52.604 --> 37:54.811
And who do you think hired him?

37:56.065 --> 37:57.646
Of course.

38:00.612 --> 38:02.477
Is there something you wish to say?

38:04.991 --> 38:06.401
No, poppa.

38:06.493 --> 38:09.610
Except to point out
that Harvey dent is still alive.

38:12.832 --> 38:14.868
Because I allow it.

38:15.168 --> 38:16.248
For now.

38:18.296 --> 38:19.786
This...

38:19.881 --> 38:22.167
This is what I keep talking about.

38:22.342 --> 38:23.798
This is Oxford.

38:23.885 --> 38:25.876
That place polluted your mind, Alberto.

38:26.262 --> 38:28.628
You used to know your place. Now?

38:29.599 --> 38:31.214
I should have never sent you there.

38:35.647 --> 38:37.854
The dangers of independent thought.

38:39.651 --> 38:41.937
When have you had
one independent thought

38:42.111 --> 38:44.193
that actually benefited this family?

38:45.698 --> 38:48.565
Maybe when I sent flowers
to dent's hospital room

38:48.660 --> 38:49.820
in the Falcone name.

38:51.704 --> 38:53.240
You did what?

38:55.458 --> 38:57.039
I sent flowers.

38:57.126 --> 38:59.117
I thought it would
take suspicion off of us

38:59.212 --> 39:01.168
if we looked like we care
about his recovery.

39:01.673 --> 39:04.164
Now, I suppose you'll say
it was a sloppy move.

39:10.056 --> 39:13.173
I can forgive sloppy.

39:14.352 --> 39:16.513
What I will not tolerate,

39:16.604 --> 39:19.892
is you presuming to speak
on behalf of this family.

39:25.405 --> 39:28.021
Let me be perfectly clear.

39:28.867 --> 39:29.867
Again.

39:33.538 --> 39:36.621
Any notion you may hold
about being next in line

39:36.708 --> 39:39.370
to take over our business interests

39:39.460 --> 39:41.542
is a pathetic delusion.

39:50.471 --> 39:51.881
You are weak.

39:52.056 --> 39:55.014
Your weakness is my liability.

39:55.310 --> 39:59.804
You are to have zero contact
with Mr. or Mrs. Harvey dent.

40:00.899 --> 40:02.355
End of discussion.

40:54.702 --> 40:55.702
Harvey!

41:02.710 --> 41:03.710
Hello.

41:05.254 --> 41:07.495
I got a call that you went
missing from the hospital.

41:10.093 --> 41:11.583
How did I know I'd find you here?

41:13.680 --> 41:16.092
Couldn't stand being cooped up anymore.

41:16.516 --> 41:18.677
Thought I'd stretch my legs.

41:18.768 --> 41:19.768
Yeah.

41:20.269 --> 41:22.851
Listen, why don't you hop in?
I'll take you back.

41:22.939 --> 41:25.555
Oh, no. No. No. No. No.
I like it out here.

41:28.027 --> 41:30.518
I'm on my way home
for Thanksgiving dinner.

41:30.655 --> 41:33.647
You should come along.
Barbara always makes a ton.

41:33.741 --> 41:34.776
I'm not hungry.

41:39.622 --> 41:41.908
Harvey, what are we doing here?

41:44.919 --> 41:47.501
I don't know.
Maybe I wasn't ready for this yet.

41:48.965 --> 41:50.455
I think I'm gonna go back now.

41:51.300 --> 41:53.541
Don't you worry about Harvey.

41:55.847 --> 41:57.883
All right, counselor.

42:02.812 --> 42:06.225
As far as I'm concerned,
you don't have this.

42:09.569 --> 42:13.312
The falcones are dangerous people
and, to them, you're the bad guy.

42:13.823 --> 42:14.983
Protect your family.

42:28.880 --> 42:31.337
So, I made him an offer, you know.

42:39.182 --> 42:40.262
To the family.

42:41.100 --> 42:42.260
Those dearly departed...

42:44.312 --> 42:47.896
And those whom we are fortunate
to have beside us here today.

42:47.982 --> 42:51.349
Let us be thankful for the time
we still have together

42:51.444 --> 42:54.277
and for the many blessings
bestowed upon us.

42:56.532 --> 42:59.444
- Alla salute!
- Salute!

43:10.671 --> 43:11.751
Ah, yes.

43:13.508 --> 43:14.818
- Oh, look.
- Oh, come here!

43:14.842 --> 43:16.298
- Oh-ho!
- Yeah!

43:17.053 --> 43:19.544
- I told you I'd walk.
- Very good. Very good.

43:19.639 --> 43:21.550
Yeah!

43:22.266 --> 43:23.266
\wwhoo-hoo!

43:23.518 --> 43:24.803
Welcome back.

43:38.074 --> 43:39.074
Barbara?

43:57.135 --> 43:58.135
Ooh!

44:28.958 --> 44:30.994
Solomon grundy...

44:31.919 --> 44:34.786
Born on a Monday...

44:42.722 --> 44:45.964
Believe me, I told him
where he could stick the cape.

44:47.852 --> 44:49.638
Even Gordon laughed.

44:50.813 --> 44:52.724
That's when they let me go.

45:22.595 --> 45:25.553
You don't need me for this.
I should be out hunting.

45:25.765 --> 45:27.346
We've got it covered.

45:28.100 --> 45:31.012
All of Gotham pd will be deployed
throughout town by midnight.

45:33.731 --> 45:37.770
One way or another, when holiday
comes calling, we'll be ready.

45:39.862 --> 45:41.727
You know, this was all you.

45:42.615 --> 45:44.697
I wanted them
in Gotham penitentiary.

45:45.785 --> 45:49.198
This was Harvey. And he was right.

45:56.545 --> 45:57.910
Calendar man.

45:59.131 --> 46:00.131
So...

46:01.467 --> 46:03.879
A killer who only works on holidays.

46:05.596 --> 46:07.461
And it's December 24th.

46:09.392 --> 46:11.849
I was wondering when you'd get to me.

46:11.936 --> 46:13.722
We don't have much time, day.

46:13.854 --> 46:16.561
Who killed Johnny viti on Halloween?

46:17.108 --> 46:21.147
The same person who killed Mickey chen
and his crew on Thanksgiving.

46:22.613 --> 46:24.274
We need a better answer than that.

46:24.699 --> 46:26.564
Viti was the Roman's nephew.

46:27.451 --> 46:29.487
The Roman was chen's employer.

46:30.538 --> 46:32.449
First suspect is, therefore,

46:33.124 --> 46:34.124
the Roman.

46:38.462 --> 46:42.705
But since sneaking around
isn't really Falcone's style,

46:42.800 --> 46:44.836
we move on to the second suspect.

46:46.304 --> 46:49.546
Someone hoping for the fall
of the Roman empire.

46:51.225 --> 46:52.556
Like sal maroni.

46:53.394 --> 46:55.350
He's as good a guess
as any of the others.

46:56.897 --> 46:57.977
What "others"?

47:00.109 --> 47:01.349
You're down a man.

47:03.154 --> 47:04.519
This is a waste of time.

47:05.239 --> 47:06.854
I told you to bring Mr. dent.

47:07.783 --> 47:09.193
He isn't safe out there.

47:10.703 --> 47:12.785
The da who put you all in arkham?

47:12.955 --> 47:14.866
Half the patients here
would kill him on sight,

47:14.957 --> 47:18.870
so, I'd say out there
is the only place he is safe.

47:21.005 --> 47:22.005
Perhaps.

47:22.965 --> 47:24.796
Or perhaps he doesn't know you're here.

47:26.469 --> 47:27.504
Perhaps...

47:29.930 --> 47:31.921
The district attorney...

47:33.684 --> 47:35.174
Is a suspect.

47:41.150 --> 47:42.265
Ah.

47:44.362 --> 47:48.696
Well, of course.
Intelligent, calculating,

47:48.783 --> 47:51.866
with a mission
to take down carmine Falcone.

47:52.745 --> 47:53.825
It all fits.

47:53.996 --> 47:55.782
Harvey dent is not a killer.

47:58.417 --> 48:00.783
Unless he's leading a double life.

48:01.921 --> 48:04.879
Like your caped crusader, here.

48:04.965 --> 48:07.456
Why did you ask for me?

48:07.635 --> 48:09.466
So you could see for yourself.

48:11.472 --> 48:13.383
I don't have time for your crazy.

48:14.850 --> 48:16.306
You really don't.

48:17.269 --> 48:20.432
There's lots of crazy
out there these days.

48:23.109 --> 48:26.021
And just when you thought
you'd cleaned it all up.

48:27.530 --> 48:29.020
What a...

48:30.699 --> 48:31.699
Joke.

48:41.293 --> 48:42.658
Happy holiday.

48:43.712 --> 48:45.122
Open it!

49:02.606 --> 49:04.686
He had somebody get to my kid!

49:04.733 --> 49:06.689
If... if I didn't help him.

49:07.445 --> 49:08.605
I'm sorry.

49:09.905 --> 49:10.905
Harvey isn't safe.

49:11.198 --> 49:12.198
Go!

49:26.630 --> 49:29.838
"Tis the season to be jolly

49:30.092 --> 49:33.380
ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Ha-ha-ha-ha!

49:34.221 --> 49:37.463
Outside it's an awful chiller

49:37.558 --> 49:40.425
ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Ha-ha-ha-ha!

49:41.395 --> 49:44.603
Boy, this holiday's a killer

49:44.690 --> 49:47.932
ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Ha-ha-ha-ha!

49:48.068 --> 49:50.059
Gilda? Is that you?

49:52.239 --> 49:53.354
"Gilda"!

49:55.743 --> 49:57.825
She looked like a gilda.

50:07.379 --> 50:08.915
Relax, lollipop!

50:09.507 --> 50:11.714
Police issue.

50:12.092 --> 50:13.092
Where's my wife?

50:13.761 --> 50:17.720
She's just where I left her,
last-minute shopping.

50:20.434 --> 50:23.551
Spoiler alert. It's socks.

50:23.812 --> 50:24.972
What do you want?

50:27.566 --> 50:30.433
Aww, I thought
I was playing santi claus!

50:30.528 --> 50:32.393
Oh, all right.

50:32.738 --> 50:35.980
I want a fire engine
and a football and...

50:36.075 --> 50:38.612
To deliver a message.

50:40.996 --> 50:43.988
Put the gun down and we'll talk.

50:46.794 --> 50:47.794
Sure!

51:01.267 --> 51:02.787
Your suspicions were correct.

51:02.851 --> 51:06.309
A Santa clown has reportedly terrorized
three families today.

51:06.814 --> 51:09.396
Sir, they were all named "dent."

51:17.700 --> 51:19.031
Whoo!

51:39.513 --> 51:40.923
Where did you get that?

51:41.432 --> 51:42.547
Why?

51:42.850 --> 51:45.216
Ya missin' one?

51:46.145 --> 51:48.477
You could use some cheering up!

51:48.564 --> 51:51.431
Have ya heard the one
about the murderous clown

51:51.525 --> 51:53.186
that escaped the asylum

51:53.277 --> 51:56.769
and showed up at the home of the da
who put him there?

51:58.240 --> 52:01.403
See, there's a persistent rumor
round these parts

52:01.535 --> 52:05.824
that da dent
is more than he appears to be.

52:07.374 --> 52:11.037
But there's only room for one
homicidal maniac in this town.

52:11.253 --> 52:15.963
And if I hear that happy Harvey dent
is steppin' out,

52:16.050 --> 52:20.009
I'll make sure little gilda
doesn't have to clothes-shop

52:20.095 --> 52:22.461
for hubby-wubby ever again.

52:23.724 --> 52:25.214
You call that a joke?

52:26.810 --> 52:29.142
But you haven't even
heard the punchline!

52:29.229 --> 52:30.594
It goes like this!

52:39.156 --> 52:40.156
Harvey.

52:41.784 --> 52:43.069
Harvey, can you hear me?

52:45.120 --> 52:46.781
Any idea where he was heading?

52:49.041 --> 52:50.041
Maroni...

52:51.710 --> 52:53.166
Mangia.

53:15.359 --> 53:17.566
What happened to your
friend's face, maroni?

53:17.653 --> 53:19.393
Nothin'. What happened to yours?

53:19.488 --> 53:20.528
Oh, you mother...

53:20.572 --> 53:22.813
Tell me everything he said.

53:23.492 --> 53:25.448
If you get off of my neck.

53:32.126 --> 53:34.117
He was inside before we got there.

53:34.253 --> 53:36.744
Took out the whole staff,
poisoned the fagioli.

53:37.005 --> 53:40.247
I wasn't hungry,
but, uh, Freddy, here...

53:40.884 --> 53:42.670
I don't know. Guess I'm lucky.

53:42.761 --> 53:45.548
No. He let you live. Why?

53:45.806 --> 53:47.262
Do I look like I know?

53:47.349 --> 53:50.261
He put a gun in my face
and told me that this is his turf

53:50.394 --> 53:52.510
and that he's cracking down
on interlopers.

53:52.771 --> 53:54.136
Maybe I should thank him.

53:56.734 --> 53:58.520
I don't know where you get off.

53:58.777 --> 54:02.315
Freaks like this clown used to play
way out on the fringe,

54:02.448 --> 54:03.733
but once you showed up...

54:06.076 --> 54:07.076
Relax, pal.

54:11.290 --> 54:13.576
Ya know, things used to
run smooth in this town.

54:14.334 --> 54:18.418
Now, we got killer crocs
and moths and sewer zombies,

54:18.505 --> 54:20.871
not to mention a homicidal maniac

54:20.966 --> 54:23.833
skulking around the holidays
hittin' made men.

54:26.180 --> 54:30.014
What's the common thread? Huh.

54:30.642 --> 54:32.132
Where is he?

54:32.394 --> 54:34.180
Who knows? He's a nutjob.

54:34.271 --> 54:36.432
But if he's the guy
killin' Falcone's men,

54:36.523 --> 54:39.435
it's only a matter of time
till he gets to old carmine himself.

54:39.818 --> 54:40.898
Maybe start there.

54:42.821 --> 54:45.563
Not really much of a detective, are ya?

55:11.141 --> 55:12.141
Hello.

55:29.827 --> 55:33.069
Navy, Navy, charcoal, black.

55:33.247 --> 55:34.247
Ugh!

55:34.748 --> 55:38.332
Really, carm, is a splash
of color too much to ask?

55:38.752 --> 55:42.244
Stop clowning around.
If you're gonna kill me, just do it.

55:43.757 --> 55:46.624
Is this the face of a killer?

55:50.931 --> 55:52.592
Ugh!

55:52.766 --> 55:54.051
I guess it is!

55:56.436 --> 56:00.020
Oh, relax, polpetto,
I'm not going to kill you.

56:01.149 --> 56:03.014
Not tonight, anyway.

56:03.110 --> 56:05.146
It's Christmas!

56:05.821 --> 56:06.821
But...

56:07.739 --> 56:10.856
Someone will die tonight.

56:10.993 --> 56:13.450
Probably someone close to you.

56:13.829 --> 56:16.696
Don't you want to know
who's pulling the trigger?

56:19.251 --> 56:21.913
Anyhoo, I just popped in to say,

56:22.004 --> 56:25.246
if you hear any news about
the holiday investigation,

56:25.340 --> 56:27.706
I'd like you to pass it my way.

56:29.219 --> 56:31.505
As a professional courtesy.

56:32.890 --> 56:34.676
Here's my card!

56:37.811 --> 56:38.926
Buon natale!

56:43.400 --> 56:44.856
Buon natale.

56:44.943 --> 56:46.524
Hoo!

56:46.695 --> 56:47.810
I kill me.

56:55.412 --> 56:56.412
What the hell?

57:07.716 --> 57:08.716
Missed me!

57:11.303 --> 57:13.419
Whoo!

57:18.101 --> 57:20.638
You know what I forgot?

57:35.661 --> 57:38.368
Whoa! That was close.

57:42.292 --> 57:44.248
Wheel

58:50.027 --> 58:51.437
I would remind you, sir,

58:51.528 --> 58:55.066
of Mr. Falcone's annual benefit
for the Gotham children's clinic.

58:55.699 --> 58:59.032
It would be advisable to show your face
at least one year.

58:59.745 --> 59:01.861
Your father built that hospital.

59:01.955 --> 59:03.695
He helped the Roman build it.

59:04.708 --> 59:06.619
Still, a good cause.

59:06.710 --> 59:09.543
And, frankly, a night on a yacht
could do you some good.

59:10.213 --> 59:11.669
Miss Kyle will be there.

59:15.969 --> 59:18.051
Three murders on three holidays.

59:18.722 --> 59:20.929
Each of the victims
a Falcone associate.

59:21.016 --> 59:23.382
All shot with the same type
of untraceable gun.

59:23.560 --> 59:24.560
No withesses.

59:25.395 --> 59:26.395
Suspects?

59:27.773 --> 59:29.889
Salvatore maroni.

59:30.067 --> 59:32.558
His family's always been
second to the Roman.

59:32.944 --> 59:34.980
He's notoriously ambitious.

59:35.072 --> 59:37.859
But he's killed Falcone's men
in broad daylight.

59:37.949 --> 59:40.235
Why the cloak-and-dagger
holiday business?

59:41.286 --> 59:43.402
Carla viti, Falcone's sister.

59:43.538 --> 59:45.745
Runs their Chicago operation.

59:45.832 --> 59:48.164
She could be making a play
for control of the family.

59:48.251 --> 59:51.084
By killing
her only son on Halloween?

59:51.171 --> 59:52.411
She is a criminal.

59:53.215 --> 59:56.207
And he is a homicidal maniac.

59:56.301 --> 59:59.259
The guard testified that
he escaped before the first murder.

01:00:00.388 --> 01:00:01.844
The Roman himself.

01:00:02.099 --> 01:00:04.090
Johnny viti was about to flip

01:00:04.184 --> 01:00:07.301
and Mickey chen could testify
that Falcone ordered dent's murder.

01:00:07.813 --> 01:00:10.179
He had motive to silence them both.

01:00:10.357 --> 01:00:12.348
But why kill his own bodyguard?

01:00:12.442 --> 01:00:15.934
May I ask why you're keeping
the fifth suspect off the board?

01:00:17.114 --> 01:00:18.394
Because I don't like it.

01:00:19.324 --> 01:00:21.440
But it fits. Doesn't it?

01:00:22.702 --> 01:00:25.034
Obsessed with taking down Falcone.

01:00:25.163 --> 01:00:28.872
More than boss maroni
and every ambitious made man in town.

01:00:28.959 --> 01:00:31.701
He was turned down
for a gun license last year,

01:00:31.795 --> 01:00:34.958
when the psych eval showed some
wild aberrations.

01:00:36.967 --> 01:00:38.673
Or is it someone else entirely?

01:00:39.636 --> 01:00:41.592
Someone we haven't even considered.

01:00:43.140 --> 01:00:46.052
I thought this would be about sweeping
criminals off the street,

01:00:46.226 --> 01:00:48.137
maybe scaring them straight.

01:00:48.854 --> 01:00:52.312
I never thought that Batman
was going to have to be a detective.

01:00:52.399 --> 01:00:53.399
A good one.

01:00:56.153 --> 01:00:57.939
What if I can't save them, Alfred?

01:00:59.114 --> 01:01:02.072
I've seen these growing pains
before, sir,

01:01:02.159 --> 01:01:04.491
and I am confident that, in the end,

01:01:04.578 --> 01:01:07.661
the Batman will be
what the world needs him to be.

01:01:09.875 --> 01:01:12.662
The same, I believe,
should be said of Bruce Wayne.

01:01:38.904 --> 01:01:40.314
My distinguished guests,

01:01:41.281 --> 01:01:43.488
it is my honor to welcome
you here tonight.

01:01:44.534 --> 01:01:47.492
I see a lot of familiar faces. Mayor.

01:01:50.290 --> 01:01:51.370
Your eminence.

01:01:54.836 --> 01:01:56.417
No, I was talking to sal maroni.

01:02:01.259 --> 01:02:03.716
Sal maroni. On my yacht.

01:02:04.512 --> 01:02:08.130
It's like my father always said,
"keep your enemies close...

01:02:08.892 --> 01:02:10.428
And a loaded gun closer."

01:02:15.899 --> 01:02:16.809
Yeanh.

01:02:16.900 --> 01:02:20.063
Thirty years ago,
a small group of concerned gothamites

01:02:20.153 --> 01:02:21.734
joined together to build something

01:02:21.821 --> 01:02:25.279
the politicians squabbling
in the halls of government could not.

01:02:26.368 --> 01:02:27.733
Dr. Thomas Wayne and I

01:02:27.827 --> 01:02:30.694
built the children's clinic
to protect families.

01:02:31.539 --> 01:02:32.574
And if you know me,

01:02:32.916 --> 01:02:37.580
you know there is nothing
more important to me than family.

01:02:38.630 --> 01:02:40.166
So, buon anno!

01:02:40.298 --> 01:02:43.381
Thank you all for being here
and for your generosity.

01:02:43.969 --> 01:02:45.459
Let's beat last year's total.

01:02:46.304 --> 01:02:48.966
Remember, cash only, please.

01:03:00.318 --> 01:03:03.685
Also, I would like to thank
our corporate sponsors,

01:03:03.905 --> 01:03:05.145
kord omniversal,

01:03:05.532 --> 01:03:06.567
soder cola,

01:03:07.075 --> 01:03:10.693
and, for the 10th year running,
Gotham broadcasting company.

01:03:11.871 --> 01:03:13.236
Oh! On.

01:03:13.581 --> 01:03:15.287
I'm so sorry!

01:03:15.375 --> 01:03:16.375
Here, let me.

01:03:19.421 --> 01:03:22.003
No, thank you.

01:03:22.090 --> 01:03:25.548
One more thing, and then
I promise I'll let you enjoy the party.

01:03:26.469 --> 01:03:28.334
I would like to acknowledge someone.

01:03:28.430 --> 01:03:31.922
As I said, nothing is more
important to me than family.

01:03:32.559 --> 01:03:34.515
And, perhaps, my one regret

01:03:34.602 --> 01:03:39.642
is making this man feel like
he is not a part of this family.

01:03:40.442 --> 01:03:42.524
We have not always agreed on details.

01:03:44.237 --> 01:03:47.900
But we agree
on the most important things.

01:03:48.491 --> 01:03:50.447
We believe in family.

01:03:53.204 --> 01:03:56.037
We believe in business.

01:03:56.416 --> 01:03:57.952
And, like all of you here tonight,

01:03:58.960 --> 01:04:02.123
we believe in Gotham city.

01:04:03.590 --> 01:04:06.923
Ladies and gentlemen,
the son I never had...

01:04:07.886 --> 01:04:09.046
Mr. Bruce Wayne.

01:04:46.132 --> 01:04:48.132
- I think I see them!
- Wh-what?

01:04:48.551 --> 01:04:51.588
As if it matters.
I hardly ever see you, anyway.

01:04:51.846 --> 01:04:53.507
I'm just saying, there's no need to...

01:04:53.598 --> 01:04:54.883
Hey, Harvey!

01:05:01.356 --> 01:05:03.221
Shouldn't you be working, captain?

01:05:03.400 --> 01:05:04.400
I am.

01:05:04.859 --> 01:05:07.896
This is the largest police presence
this city's ever seen.

01:05:07.987 --> 01:05:09.898
We got caught with our
pants down on Christmas,

01:05:09.989 --> 01:05:12.401
but heaven help holiday
if he tries anything here tonight.

01:05:15.995 --> 01:05:17.906
Always on duty.

01:05:17.997 --> 01:05:18.997
Always.

01:05:19.707 --> 01:05:21.117
You didn't bring the kids?

01:05:21.501 --> 01:05:23.537
They're sleeping over
at my mother's tonight.

01:05:23.628 --> 01:05:26.461
We should try and hire you
to sit next time, gilda.

01:05:26.548 --> 01:05:28.504
I bet you're great with kids.

01:05:28.591 --> 01:05:30.752
I haven't worked as a sitter in years.

01:05:31.010 --> 01:05:33.467
It paid her way
through law school.

01:05:33.972 --> 01:05:35.212
I didn't know you're a lawyer.

01:05:35.515 --> 01:05:36.515
I was.

01:05:37.517 --> 01:05:38.677
Now, I'm not anything.

01:05:44.607 --> 01:05:46.268
Dead pilot? Check.

01:05:47.944 --> 01:05:49.980
Ground crew? Check.

01:05:51.656 --> 01:05:54.773
Poison gas? Check.

01:05:56.536 --> 01:05:59.152
Time to ring in the new year.

01:06:06.629 --> 01:06:10.497
Ladies and gentlemen,
please fasten your seatbelts,

01:06:10.592 --> 01:06:14.801
as I have no idea how to fly this thing!

01:06:30.945 --> 01:06:32.731
Looks like a real party.

01:06:32.822 --> 01:06:34.938
So, what the hell are we doing here?

01:06:35.575 --> 01:06:36.575
I don't know.

01:06:38.203 --> 01:06:40.410
Something tells me
this is where I need to be tonight.

01:06:45.668 --> 01:06:47.659
We...

01:06:47.754 --> 01:06:50.416
Look, we haven't talked,
and I think we should.

01:06:52.091 --> 01:06:53.797
I feel like whatever this is...

01:06:54.219 --> 01:06:58.804
Whatever we've tried to be to
one another is... unraveling.

01:07:00.350 --> 01:07:01.965
And we both know why.

01:07:04.187 --> 01:07:05.518
We've never spoken of it,

01:07:05.605 --> 01:07:09.348
but the truth is that
you and I are two different people.

01:07:10.777 --> 01:07:12.438
It was fun to try...

01:07:13.321 --> 01:07:16.529
But I don't think we're ever
gonna be able to put it all together.

01:07:17.992 --> 01:07:20.654
I guess we're just not cut out for...

01:07:21.621 --> 01:07:22.781
Whatever this is.

01:07:23.957 --> 01:07:24.992
Was.

01:07:34.884 --> 01:07:38.797
Don't worry, though.
I'll see you on the other side.

01:07:50.733 --> 01:07:51.893
When did you do it?

01:07:52.902 --> 01:07:54.062
Do what?

01:07:54.654 --> 01:07:57.566
You took my watch without me noticing.

01:07:57.657 --> 01:07:59.773
So, when did you do it? I'm curious.

01:08:01.452 --> 01:08:02.692
Take it from me, Bruce,

01:08:03.496 --> 01:08:06.738
around here,
curiosity can get you killed.

01:08:15.675 --> 01:08:16.675
Not now.

01:08:19.136 --> 01:08:20.136
What?

01:08:21.180 --> 01:08:22.180
Where?

01:08:27.520 --> 01:08:30.683
I just want to have a normal night.
Can we just have a normal night?

01:08:31.107 --> 01:08:33.223
I don't even know what that is anymore.

01:08:34.193 --> 01:08:36.058
I am alone here.

01:08:37.947 --> 01:08:40.654
I told myself it was okay
because it would get better,

01:08:40.742 --> 01:08:42.448
but it hasn't.

01:08:42.952 --> 01:08:44.908
You don't have to be alone.

01:08:44.996 --> 01:08:47.282
We've talked about having a baby.

01:08:47.665 --> 01:08:50.532
I can't! You know that I can't!

01:08:50.877 --> 01:08:52.332
Maybe not the old-fashioned way,

01:08:52.420 --> 01:08:54.023
but that doesn't mean
that we can't try something...

01:08:54.046 --> 01:08:55.787
I don't want it.

01:08:55.881 --> 01:08:59.670
I don't want it because I can't
and I can't because I don't want it.

01:09:01.054 --> 01:09:03.170
Can we please
talk about this in private?

01:09:05.308 --> 01:09:07.765
Jesus, why can't you be more like...

01:09:09.937 --> 01:09:11.518
More like who?

01:09:16.152 --> 01:09:17.813
I'm only one man.

01:09:17.904 --> 01:09:18.984
I can't do this.

01:09:20.156 --> 01:09:21.236
Not now.

01:09:25.286 --> 01:09:26.366
Excuse us.

01:09:29.374 --> 01:09:32.491
Jim, did you know they're
having these kinds of problems?

01:09:33.211 --> 01:09:34.121
Jim?

01:09:34.212 --> 01:09:35.702
Yeah. I see it now.

01:09:35.796 --> 01:09:36.796
Huh?

01:09:38.091 --> 01:09:39.921
What's going on?

01:09:42.886 --> 01:09:44.171
Crappy new year!

01:09:56.442 --> 01:09:57.442
Hey.

01:10:10.081 --> 01:10:16.577
Should all offenses be forgot
and never brought to trial...

01:10:18.381 --> 01:10:21.999
Oh, silly me. The safety. Ha!

01:10:25.972 --> 01:10:30.306
Ooh, pretty.

01:10:39.569 --> 01:10:40.900
Huh?

01:10:46.075 --> 01:10:47.690
Well, shit.

01:10:54.542 --> 01:10:57.784
Economy class
ain't what she used to be. Ha!

01:11:04.427 --> 01:11:05.946
This area needs to be clear!

01:11:05.970 --> 01:11:07.551
Everyone remain calm.

01:11:07.638 --> 01:11:08.638
This way!

01:11:10.475 --> 01:11:12.466
- Pearce!
- Captain, sir!

01:11:12.727 --> 01:11:14.263
I need to get my wife out of here.

01:11:14.854 --> 01:11:17.015
Yes, sir! Follow me, ma'am.

01:11:40.046 --> 01:11:42.287
What are you trying to prove
with this stunt, joker?

01:11:42.799 --> 01:11:45.290
Prove? Stunt? Joker?

01:11:45.426 --> 01:11:47.508
No, wait, that one's right.

01:11:47.595 --> 01:11:49.426
Why did you kill Johnny viti?
â€œWhat?

01:11:49.514 --> 01:11:51.755
And Mickey chen and milos grappa?

01:11:52.099 --> 01:11:54.886
You think I'm holiday?

01:11:54.977 --> 01:11:59.437
Oh, poppet, I didn't know you cared.

01:12:03.778 --> 01:12:05.143
Of course I'm not holiday!

01:12:05.238 --> 01:12:07.980
If I were him,
why would I be trying to kill him?

01:12:08.533 --> 01:12:09.533
Kill him?

01:12:09.742 --> 01:12:11.653
He's the competition!

01:12:11.744 --> 01:12:14.360
And, like the corn kernel always says,

01:12:14.455 --> 01:12:16.912
"I won't be number two."

01:12:25.758 --> 01:12:27.248
If it's holiday you want dead...

01:12:28.135 --> 01:12:30.421
Then why gas everyone in Gotham square?

01:12:30.638 --> 01:12:32.674
Half the city's down there,

01:12:32.765 --> 01:12:36.508
which means holiday either is, or isn't!

01:12:36.602 --> 01:12:38.968
I have a 50-50 chance.

01:12:39.063 --> 01:12:43.181
And if I fail, well, at least
I've killed a lot of innocent people.

01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:54.613
No, don't kill me!
Not before I find out who holiday is!

01:12:56.622 --> 01:12:57.702
Why do you care?

01:12:57.915 --> 01:13:00.406
Oh, you adorable fool!

01:13:00.793 --> 01:13:04.752
Don't you know by now?
I'm just like youl!

01:13:04.881 --> 01:13:07.793
We both love a good puzzle.

01:13:19.395 --> 01:13:22.262
So, when the clock strikes 12:00,

01:13:22.398 --> 01:13:24.559
do I get a little kiss?

01:13:36.412 --> 01:13:38.619
Whoop! Taking that as a "no."

01:14:08.027 --> 01:14:10.564
There goes my resolution.

01:14:10.655 --> 01:14:11.986
Hal

01:14:15.451 --> 01:14:17.487
out of the way. Now! Move!

01:14:38.307 --> 01:14:39.592
Alberto, right?

01:14:42.269 --> 01:14:43.269
Selina.

01:14:47.316 --> 01:14:49.398
Can I ask you a question?

01:14:49.485 --> 01:14:53.273
I'm trying to imagine what it's like
to grow up around all this.

01:14:53.906 --> 01:14:54.906
I wouldn't know.

01:14:55.866 --> 01:14:59.825
"Mr. family" had me in boarding schools
overseas before I could walk.

01:15:00.579 --> 01:15:03.867
Which is fine.
I would have never fit in here, anyway.

01:15:04.917 --> 01:15:08.330
I'm an Oxford graduate
who's learned more about business

01:15:08.421 --> 01:15:11.754
than my father could ever
hope to understand, yet...

01:15:11.841 --> 01:15:13.706
You don't get a seat at the table.

01:15:14.635 --> 01:15:17.377
Because I'm "weak." I fell in love.

01:15:18.431 --> 01:15:19.716
How is that weak?

01:15:20.766 --> 01:15:24.133
She was the wrong woman.
Wrong for the family.

01:15:25.021 --> 01:15:27.558
Wrong for him.

01:15:27.648 --> 01:15:30.685
And, back then,
I was so desperate for his approval.

01:15:32.778 --> 01:15:33.984
What happened to her?

01:15:36.574 --> 01:15:38.064
Terrible things.

01:15:38.159 --> 01:15:40.901
I let him scare her away from me.

01:15:40.995 --> 01:15:44.829
Which, ironically, only proved that he
was right about me in the first place.

01:15:46.333 --> 01:15:48.494
Weak. An embarrassment.

01:15:50.171 --> 01:15:51.752
I'm sorry, I don't mean to...

01:15:56.635 --> 01:15:58.296
Why do I feel like I can talk to you?

01:15:59.055 --> 01:16:00.591
Uh, I, um...

01:16:02.058 --> 01:16:03.093
I just...

01:16:06.479 --> 01:16:08.936
Oh, no. No, I'm sorry, I...

01:16:09.565 --> 01:16:11.521
I can't... we can't.

01:16:11.609 --> 01:16:12.769
Get away from her.

01:16:17.990 --> 01:16:18.990
Bruce!

01:16:19.408 --> 01:16:22.491
Wait. Bruce? Wayne?

01:16:23.245 --> 01:16:25.236
Bruce Wayne is the Batman?

01:16:25.581 --> 01:16:28.288
And Alberto Falcone is holiday.

01:16:28.375 --> 01:16:30.036
Surprises all around.

01:16:30.294 --> 01:16:33.081
Me? You've been fed
some bad clues, Bruce.

01:16:33.881 --> 01:16:35.963
But I still solved the puzzle.

01:16:36.592 --> 01:16:38.548
The rejected son,

01:16:38.636 --> 01:16:41.799
born to inherit an empire,
but cast aside.

01:16:42.807 --> 01:16:43.967
You're wrong.

01:16:44.433 --> 01:16:47.391
You knew you'd never be
handed the keys to the kingdom,

01:16:47.478 --> 01:16:51.141
so you manufactured a crisis
that targets the family business.

01:16:51.232 --> 01:16:52.438
What?

01:16:52.650 --> 01:16:55.312
With potential successors
dropping like flies,

01:16:55.402 --> 01:16:57.734
poppa tightened the circle
to family only,

01:16:57.822 --> 01:17:00.905
and, for the first time,
you were on the inside.

01:17:02.868 --> 01:17:05.450
I don't want control of the family!

01:17:05.579 --> 01:17:06.614
I never did!

01:17:06.705 --> 01:17:11.369
Ten! Nine! Eight!
Seven! Six! Five!

01:17:11.460 --> 01:17:12.575
Four! Three!

01:17:12.670 --> 01:17:14.501
I would happily trade
that for a normal life!

01:17:14.588 --> 01:17:16.704
To spend my days as far away
from Gotham as possible.

01:17:16.799 --> 01:17:17.901
Two! One! Happy new year!

01:17:17.925 --> 01:17:19.790
To get married, and have a child with...

01:17:28.561 --> 01:17:29.676
Oh, my god!

01:17:51.458 --> 01:17:52.948
You couldn't know.

01:17:54.086 --> 01:17:55.997
You're missing so many pieces.

01:19:49.743 --> 01:19:50.743
Come on.

01:19:55.916 --> 01:19:57.656
Jim, what the hell are we doing?

01:19:58.627 --> 01:19:59.627
Oh.

01:20:03.882 --> 01:20:07.795
The divers will be fishing out
parts of Alberto Falcone for days.

01:20:07.886 --> 01:20:10.047
Five-bladed prop
on its slowest speed.

01:20:10.723 --> 01:20:11.963
Hell of a way to go.

01:20:12.057 --> 01:20:13.547
That isn't how he went.

01:20:14.351 --> 01:20:17.809
He was shot by holiday
before going overboard.

01:20:18.147 --> 01:20:21.014
Hang on. Alberto wasn't holiday?

01:20:21.317 --> 01:20:22.648
I thought he was.

01:20:22.735 --> 01:20:25.522
It was occam's razor, Jim,
the simplest solution.

01:20:26.739 --> 01:20:27.739
But it was wrong.

01:20:30.075 --> 01:20:31.781
I went there for Alberto Falcone.

01:20:33.495 --> 01:20:35.486
I thought I was supposed to stop him,

01:20:35.914 --> 01:20:38.496
but I was supposed to save him.

01:20:40.586 --> 01:20:43.293
He was innocent. And now he's dead.

01:20:45.674 --> 01:20:47.380
I needed to be better.

01:20:49.386 --> 01:20:50.592
We all did.

01:20:51.764 --> 01:20:52.764
All of us.

01:20:54.558 --> 01:20:57.265
You have to put a protective detail
on carmine Falcone.

01:20:57.394 --> 01:20:58.884
If he'll even let you.

01:20:59.563 --> 01:21:02.646
Do you realize we started out
trying to take down the Roman,

01:21:02.733 --> 01:21:04.644
and, now, we're trying to save him?

01:21:04.735 --> 01:21:06.475
When did that happen?

01:21:06.570 --> 01:21:07.810
I have a better question.

01:21:07.905 --> 01:21:11.944
If Alberto Falcone wasn't holiday...
Then who is?

01:21:12.910 --> 01:21:14.116
And who's next?

01:24:01.787 --> 01:24:04.073
Grant that our brother
may sleep here

01:24:04.164 --> 01:24:06.701
in peace until you awaken him to glory,

01:24:06.792 --> 01:24:10.034
for you are the resurrection
and the life.

01:24:10.128 --> 01:24:12.289
Then he will see you face to face

01:24:12.756 --> 01:24:15.247
and in your light will see light

01:24:15.342 --> 01:24:17.503
and know the splendor of god.

01:24:17.803 --> 01:24:18.803
Amen.

01:24:19.054 --> 01:24:20.339
Amen.

01:24:37.364 --> 01:24:38.364
Bruce.

01:24:39.157 --> 01:24:40.317
A word.

01:24:41.451 --> 01:24:43.817
Carmine. If there's anything I can do.

01:24:44.288 --> 01:24:48.156
You know what I want you to do
but, time and time again, you refuse me.

01:24:50.294 --> 01:24:53.752
The Wayne foundation isn't a
money-laundering outfit for the mob.

01:24:53.839 --> 01:24:56.581
And it won't be,
so long as I'm in control.

01:24:59.928 --> 01:25:00.928
Of course.

01:25:03.223 --> 01:25:05.009
Oh, how rude of me.

01:25:05.100 --> 01:25:06.965
I don't believe you've met my associate.

01:25:09.187 --> 01:25:10.187
Charmed.
