09:25.381 --> 09:27.307
You know what?
I can teach you to skate.

09:27.459 --> 09:29.401
But what if I'm not
instantly amazing at it?

09:29.552 --> 09:31.403
I've heard that can happen.

09:32.406 --> 09:34.647
Okay, feet on the board,
bend your knees,

09:34.800 --> 09:36.074
find your center...

09:36.301 --> 09:38.318
-(grunts) See? You're doing it!
-(exclaiming)

09:38.412 --> 09:40.245
I'm doing it. I-I'm authentic.

09:40.396 --> 09:42.563
No one's ever been this real.

09:42.657 --> 09:44.641
Don't fall down!

09:44.659 --> 09:46.251
What's "falling down"?

09:46.328 --> 09:47.627
(grunts)

09:51.166 --> 09:52.924
That's-that's my blood.

09:53.001 --> 09:54.742
I've never seen it before.

09:54.761 --> 09:56.761
So cool. Let's go again.

09:56.913 --> 09:58.171
(both exclaim)

09:59.174 --> 10:02.083
Can you pass the guacamole,
#GuacAttack?

10:02.251 --> 10:03.935
#NewChipsOnTheGuac?

10:04.087 --> 10:06.329
You're hashtagging a lot lately.

10:06.348 --> 10:08.848
So Bart called you uncool,
big deal.

10:09.000 --> 10:10.925
Chasing after coolness
is futile,

10:11.094 --> 10:12.760
because the definition
is both arbitrary

10:12.779 --> 10:14.671
and constantly changing.

10:14.764 --> 10:16.740
Mm, still want to be it.

10:18.952 --> 10:21.268
With hard shell tacos,
you've got to bite them

10:21.288 --> 10:23.529
from the bottom, like this.

10:23.624 --> 10:25.439
(grunts)

10:25.533 --> 10:26.941
Why?!

10:26.960 --> 10:29.777
Why do I keep buying
hard shells?

10:29.796 --> 10:31.855
I hate them!

10:31.873 --> 10:33.857
Uh, I'm going to Moe's.

10:33.875 --> 10:36.134
At least put on a clean shirt.

10:37.028 --> 10:38.637
Hmm. Mm.

10:38.864 --> 10:40.221
Mm. Hmm.

10:44.293 --> 10:45.201
Homer.

10:45.220 --> 10:46.870
Check it out-- I'm selling

10:46.888 --> 10:48.629
premium Wagyu-style steaks.

10:48.649 --> 10:50.482
The 72-month subscription plan--

10:50.633 --> 10:53.042
it comes with a genuine
landline phone.

10:53.061 --> 10:55.712
I'm too depressed to figure out
what you're saying.

10:55.805 --> 10:57.714
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

10:57.807 --> 10:59.716
That's a Slipreme hoodie.

10:59.809 --> 11:03.078
And that ain't even a knock-off
like these donkey steaks.

11:03.905 --> 11:05.238
I got to post this.

11:05.390 --> 11:08.149
Whoa, someone posted
a picture of me,

11:08.243 --> 11:10.727
and it it's not
for falling down an escalator

11:10.820 --> 11:12.653
or yelling at a parking meter.

11:12.673 --> 11:14.172
Which means I must be...

11:14.399 --> 11:17.158
Cool. Yes, you are now cool.

11:17.326 --> 11:19.252
HOMER:
I've been liked.

11:19.404 --> 11:21.237
Someone enjoyed looking at me.

11:21.330 --> 11:24.182
Finally, I know
how it feels to be stylish.

11:24.409 --> 11:26.075
To be loved for my appearance

11:26.244 --> 11:28.169
instead of judged
for my actions.

11:28.263 --> 11:30.671
(gasps) This is why people

11:30.765 --> 11:32.524
own more than one outfit.

11:32.675 --> 11:35.360
Thank you, Mike Wegman!

11:37.030 --> 11:39.814
ORION:
540 flip straight onto your ear.

11:39.866 --> 11:41.182
Oh.

11:41.201 --> 11:42.349
Legendary!

11:42.444 --> 11:44.351
(slurring):
Am I still slurring my's words?

11:44.371 --> 11:46.538
Uh, it's-it's barely noticeable.

11:46.689 --> 11:49.023
Having a movie star dad,
I don't really get

11:49.042 --> 11:50.542
to hang out with regular kids.

11:50.693 --> 11:52.435
With you I can relax,
you know, without having

11:52.528 --> 11:54.771
to redefine our generation's
notion of relaxation.

11:54.864 --> 11:56.363
I guess I envy you.

11:56.383 --> 11:58.958
Isn't that something
rich people say to poor people

11:59.110 --> 12:01.611
so that they feel less guilty
about being rich?

12:01.629 --> 12:04.647
Yes, but for the first time,
I mean it.

12:04.649 --> 12:06.966
You helped me bleed.
Maybe I can help you.

12:07.060 --> 12:09.394
What if we design
a new sneaker together?

12:09.545 --> 12:11.396
A sneaker that
all my friends will buy?

12:11.623 --> 12:14.307
No, a sneaker that all
your friends will<i> want</i> to buy,

12:14.401 --> 12:17.460
but can't, because we won't
make enough of them.

12:17.553 --> 12:19.629
(gasps)
That's even better.

12:19.647 --> 12:21.406
Huh?

12:22.650 --> 12:24.225
What the hell are you wearing?

12:24.319 --> 12:27.078
I know what it is--
a hobo was murdered at a rave,

12:27.230 --> 12:30.156
and Homer's going undercover
to find the killer.

12:30.250 --> 12:32.492
Nah, nah, nah,
he drove a motorcycle

12:32.586 --> 12:35.754
through the clothesline
of a bi-curious farmer.

12:35.905 --> 12:38.239
(laughs)
I was once like you.

12:38.333 --> 12:40.908
Wearing clothes
I bought at the gas station

12:40.927 --> 12:42.594
or found at the beach.

12:42.745 --> 12:45.597
But I've learned something--
when you wear crazy clothes

12:45.748 --> 12:48.749
you don't understand,
you're not you anymore.

12:48.769 --> 12:50.918
You're someone better.

12:51.012 --> 12:52.771
Oh, my God.

12:52.998 --> 12:55.064
I'm beautiful.

13:02.783 --> 13:03.856
Hey.

13:04.009 --> 13:06.692
Well, look at me--
I'm a real Hep Cat.

13:06.787 --> 13:10.622
And not just because
I got Hep C, A and T.

13:10.773 --> 13:12.606
Which, I-I do got those.

13:12.700 --> 13:16.352
We must tell all middle-aged men
that they need not grow old.

13:16.371 --> 13:19.113
Where do the graying masses
gather to worship?

13:19.132 --> 13:21.448
♪<i> I'm so sophisticated</i> ♪

13:21.468 --> 13:24.135

that'll change
sneaker culture forever.

13:38.485 --> 13:40.318
Which, in this business,
is one week.

13:40.395 --> 13:43.112

14:04.660 --> 14:06.752
The Bartman One.

14:06.847 --> 14:09.422
My life has mattered.

14:09.516 --> 14:12.408
Yeah, and it comes
with a sticker in the box.

14:12.501 --> 14:14.501
The release party
is Saturday night.

14:14.596 --> 14:16.354
It's gonna be perfect.

14:16.505 --> 14:18.505
The right music,
the right influencers,

14:18.600 --> 14:20.525
and every single person there
will be young,

14:20.676 --> 14:22.509
cool and beautiful.

14:22.604 --> 14:25.271
Excuse me,
do you have this in a large?

14:25.365 --> 14:27.181
You're buying that for yourself?

14:27.275 --> 14:29.516
But old people don't
know about my clothes.

14:29.685 --> 14:31.277
Unless...

14:31.429 --> 14:32.945
Oh, no.

14:33.098 --> 14:34.097
They're here.

14:34.190 --> 14:35.948
The middle-aged.

14:36.101 --> 14:37.691
The uncool!

14:37.785 --> 14:40.044
(both screaming)

14:45.777 --> 14:47.051
This is a nightmare.

14:47.278 --> 14:49.870
My brand's been
discovered by dads.

14:49.890 --> 14:52.448
I'm wearing this to da club.

14:52.467 --> 14:54.117
Da bridge club.

14:54.210 --> 14:55.952
It's like Ed Hardy
all over again.

14:55.970 --> 14:58.121
Who the heck is Ed Hardy?

14:58.139 --> 15:01.215
<i> ORION:</i>
<i> Ed Hardy was</i>
<i> a California tattoo artist</i>

15:01.234 --> 15:03.309
<i> whose unique designs</i>
<i> were the epitome of cool.</i>

15:03.461 --> 15:04.903
<i> But then, one terrible day,</i>

15:05.130 --> 15:07.630
<i> a newly-divorced dad</i>
<i> wanted to seem younger</i>

15:07.723 --> 15:08.907
<i> on his dating profile.</i>

15:09.058 --> 15:10.742
<i> He bought</i>
<i> a sleeveless tee in XXL</i>

15:10.851 --> 15:12.410
<i> and then posted the picture.</i>

15:12.561 --> 15:14.579
<i> Young people saw</i>
<i> old people wearing the brand,</i>

15:14.730 --> 15:16.989
<i> and weeks later,</i>
<i> a $700 million empire</i>

15:17.142 --> 15:18.625
<i> was sold for scrap.</i>

15:19.994 --> 15:21.902
Stupid old losers.

15:21.996 --> 15:24.330
Slipreme's gonna die.
What do I do?!

15:24.482 --> 15:26.407
I don't know,
but we can think of something.

15:26.426 --> 15:29.335
We're two of the coolest kids
in the world, right?

15:29.487 --> 15:31.821
So cool. You've even
got your own sneaker.

15:31.914 --> 15:33.172
That's cool, isn't it?

15:33.266 --> 15:35.099
I don't even know anymore.

15:35.251 --> 15:37.268
Hey, Bart, thank your old man

15:37.495 --> 15:40.271
for introducing me
to the look of the street.

15:40.348 --> 15:43.975
Wait, Homer's the reason you're
all wearing these clothes?

15:44.127 --> 15:45.759
You know it.

15:45.779 --> 15:47.870
If my dad started this,

15:47.872 --> 15:49.505
maybe he can stop it.

15:49.524 --> 15:52.024
Yes, can I pay
for this paisley tracksuit

15:52.177 --> 15:54.243
-with airline miles?
-(grunts)

15:56.623 --> 15:58.623
Ooh. Ee. Ooh.

15:58.774 --> 16:00.941
Drop the selfie stick now.

16:00.961 --> 16:02.710
What about my Lookbook?

16:04.038 --> 16:05.612
Stop dressing
your zombie friends up

16:05.632 --> 16:07.023
in the clothes of the living.

16:07.116 --> 16:09.467
Never!
Before I discovered streetwear,

16:09.618 --> 16:11.970
people-- like my son--

16:12.121 --> 16:14.547
treated me
like a dried-up old husk.

16:14.699 --> 16:17.141
Well, you know what I am now?
A wet husk.

16:17.293 --> 16:20.144
Full of juicy corn.
Mmm, corn, Bart.

16:20.371 --> 16:23.648
You hear me? Mmm, corn.

16:23.799 --> 16:25.984
Orion and I made
something amazing together,

16:26.060 --> 16:27.819
and you're ruining it.

16:27.970 --> 16:29.821
(laughs)
Too bad.

16:29.972 --> 16:33.282
'Cause we're all going
to your sneaker release party.

16:34.327 --> 16:36.219
Just because they RSVP'd,

16:36.387 --> 16:38.479
doesn't mean
they're actually coming.

16:38.498 --> 16:40.573
Wrong. My generation

16:40.667 --> 16:42.742
shows up to things.

16:42.836 --> 16:44.210
(gasps)

16:47.081 --> 16:50.341
This is horrible. My Dad
told all his loser friends

16:50.568 --> 16:52.010
about this party.

16:52.161 --> 16:54.920
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

16:55.015 --> 16:56.922
Aah! It's my dad.

16:57.075 --> 16:58.758
Act like everything's fine.

16:58.852 --> 17:00.834
Son, I've never seen your aura

17:00.854 --> 17:02.928
looking less indigo.
Are you okay?

17:03.081 --> 17:05.023
Nothing-nothing's wrong.
I'm crushing it.

17:05.250 --> 17:08.008
I got this on lock. On lock.

17:08.028 --> 17:10.028
Your words have convinced me.

17:10.179 --> 17:12.088
The washed-up dads
are gonna be here soon.

17:12.181 --> 17:14.273
I read about it in
<i> The Old-Timers Gazette:</i>

17:14.367 --> 17:15.925
Facebook.

17:15.927 --> 17:17.184
I can't handle this.

17:17.278 --> 17:19.779
And my therapist
is pitching his sitcom today.

17:19.855 --> 17:22.290
Which I'm producing.
(whimpering)

17:23.526 --> 17:26.044
You said if I ever needed you,
you'd come.

17:26.212 --> 17:28.938
No matter what.
This is that call.

17:29.031 --> 17:32.699
Okie-dokie. Want me to grab you
some mini carrots and hummus?

17:32.794 --> 17:34.427
Yes.

17:37.057 --> 17:38.631
Listen up, people.

17:38.725 --> 17:41.041
For the first time
in your horrible lives,

17:41.061 --> 17:43.895
you are not the lamest losers
in the world.

17:44.046 --> 17:45.971
(cheering, clamoring)

17:46.066 --> 17:48.382
So if any young person
asks you what you do,

17:48.476 --> 17:52.236
say, "Virtual marketing
for a CBD massage oil startup."

17:52.463 --> 17:55.573
Now everyone take
two precautionary Advil

17:55.724 --> 17:57.658
and let's live forever!

17:58.970 --> 18:00.227
Homer, stop it!

18:00.246 --> 18:03.306
Dads, halt. Let my shorty speak.

18:03.324 --> 18:05.975
Homer, this isn't who you are.

18:06.068 --> 18:08.978
You're right--
it's better than who I am.

18:08.996 --> 18:11.738
This is the man I married.

18:11.758 --> 18:13.983
You call all deli meats baloney.

18:14.001 --> 18:15.909
You carry clippers
on your key chain

18:15.929 --> 18:18.745
so you can cut your nails
in line at the post office.

18:18.765 --> 18:21.582
You spent your stimulus check
on funny bumper stickers

18:21.601 --> 18:24.102
about what you spent your
stimulus check on.

18:24.253 --> 18:26.178
And since the day
I first saw you

18:26.272 --> 18:28.272
moonwalk out of an Arby's,

18:28.441 --> 18:30.942
you've been comfortable
in your own skin.

18:31.093 --> 18:33.194
Until now.

18:34.672 --> 18:36.948
(gasps)
I look...

18:37.099 --> 18:39.008
ridiculous!

18:39.026 --> 18:41.619
I shouldn't be
at a sneaker release party.

18:41.770 --> 18:42.936
I should be at home.

18:43.030 --> 18:46.440
Making microwave popcorn.

18:46.534 --> 18:49.109
My favorite show.

18:49.203 --> 18:51.445
We don't belong here.

18:51.539 --> 18:53.038
Men our age

18:53.191 --> 18:55.550
belong in here.

18:56.878 --> 18:59.362
The Museum of Aviation History.

18:59.380 --> 19:01.305
(excited chatter, laughing)

19:02.475 --> 19:04.049
LENNY: Oh.

19:04.126 --> 19:06.644
The cross section
of a real B-52.

19:06.795 --> 19:10.631
An IMAX movie about
the golden age of ballooning.

19:10.650 --> 19:14.377
Audio tour by Gary Sinise.

19:14.395 --> 19:17.304
It worked.
They took the dad-bait.

19:17.398 --> 19:18.881
(grunting)

19:18.900 --> 19:20.158
Dad.

19:20.385 --> 19:23.719
You did something no old person
is remotely capable of.

19:23.721 --> 19:25.738
You changed your mind.

19:25.832 --> 19:27.907
I'm sorry
I almost ruined everything

19:28.059 --> 19:29.834
for you and your friend.

19:30.061 --> 19:32.077
I have no business
wearing skatewear.

19:32.230 --> 19:34.397
I don't even like to ice skate.

19:34.415 --> 19:36.323
(grunts) Oh.

19:36.342 --> 19:39.010
I never got a pair of my own
shoes, and now they're sold out.

19:39.161 --> 19:42.588
Yo, style freaks.
I got counterfeit Bart Ones.

19:42.740 --> 19:44.331
Genuine knockoffs.

19:44.350 --> 19:46.409
Your dumb friends
can't tell the difference

19:46.427 --> 19:48.644
unless you wear 'em
or you look at 'em close.

19:50.932 --> 19:52.398
(grunts)

19:54.527 --> 19:57.937
Thanks, Dad. Sometimes
you are a little bit cool.

19:58.089 --> 20:00.740
Aw.
Buy you a chicken sandwich?

20:20.202 --> 20:22.202
Dad, tonight was a close call.

20:22.222 --> 20:23.612
This party was almost not
a cultural gamechanger.

20:23.631 --> 20:25.948
I hope you're not
disappointed in me.

20:25.967 --> 20:27.725
Oh, you can never let me down,

20:27.952 --> 20:29.952
because I know
exactly how you feel.

20:29.971 --> 20:31.637
Because you're me.

20:31.731 --> 20:33.439
No, Dad. I'm not you.

20:33.624 --> 20:35.048
And I'll never be you.

20:35.068 --> 20:37.384
(chuckles) You're not
hearing what I'm saying.

20:37.478 --> 20:38.736
You're me.

20:38.813 --> 20:41.197
A clone of me.
Like this

20:42.800 --> 20:45.409
<i> You were created on the set</i>
<i> of</i> Duplicate Cop One,

20:45.561 --> 20:48.329
<i> which we filmed</i>
<i> in a real cloning lab.</i>

20:51.325 --> 20:52.658
<i> I knew I could never</i>
<i> love a child</i>

20:52.752 --> 20:56.312
<i> as much as I love myself,</i>
<i> so I made another me:</i>

20:56.330 --> 20:57.313
<i> you.</i>

20:57.331 --> 21:00.165
But how... But I... But...
What?

21:00.242 --> 21:02.501
Didn't you ever wonder
why you don't have a mother?

21:02.670 --> 21:05.579
-Kind of.
-Orion, our cosmic connection

21:05.598 --> 21:07.080
is infinitely deeper

21:07.174 --> 21:09.008
than what a "father"
feels for a "son."

21:09.102 --> 21:11.102
I love you, me.

21:11.253 --> 21:13.920
I love you, too... me.

21:13.998 --> 21:15.164
Mm.
