WEBVTT

00:05.705 --> 00:07.573
Shannon, what are you doing?

00:07.641 --> 00:09.808
There's, like,
20 Goldfish behind the couch.

00:09.877 --> 00:11.977
I know. I'm so bad at this.

00:12.046 --> 00:14.079
Pick up the Goldfish and go get ready.

00:14.148 --> 00:15.748
We're going to Nick's parents'
for dinner.

00:15.816 --> 00:17.449
Yeah, you mind if I pass?

00:17.518 --> 00:19.385
I read this warning on the
Internet of the dangers

00:19.453 --> 00:23.222
of kids getting high on nutmeg,
and I want to try it.

00:23.290 --> 00:24.890
You're going.

00:24.959 --> 00:26.358
Walt needs our feedback.

00:26.427 --> 00:29.361
He's auditioning for a new play
about an out of control cop

00:29.430 --> 00:30.696
with no morals.

00:30.765 --> 00:32.931
Luckily, our dad is one.

00:33.000 --> 00:35.601
Yeah, people without morals suck.

00:40.307 --> 00:42.408
- Hey, baby.
- Hey, sweetie.

00:42.476 --> 00:44.676
So, what has two thumbs
and is taking you

00:44.745 --> 00:46.745
on a romantic getaway Saturday night?

00:47.848 --> 00:49.882
A-this guy.

00:49.950 --> 00:50.947
Really?

00:51.519 --> 00:52.618
What has two arms

00:52.686 --> 00:55.120
and is about to give you
the biggest hug ever?

00:55.189 --> 00:57.356
A-this girl.

00:57.425 --> 01:02.061
Hey, guys? What has two legs
and wants to jump out the window?

01:03.531 --> 01:06.298
A-this girl.

01:07.009 --> 01:08.600
This hotel is great.

01:08.669 --> 01:10.636
Olympic-size pool, private beach,

01:10.704 --> 01:13.305
four-star restaurant featuring
the tallest seafood tower

01:13.374 --> 01:14.807
on the Eastern Seaboard.

01:14.875 --> 01:16.041
- How tall is it?
- Okay.

01:16.110 --> 01:17.409
Imagine the tallest seafood tower

01:17.478 --> 01:18.710
you've ever seen on
the Eastern Seaboard.

01:18.779 --> 01:19.711
Okay.

01:19.780 --> 01:21.947
A little taller than that.

01:22.016 --> 01:24.383
Oh, I can't believe this.
What's the occasion?

01:24.452 --> 01:27.086
Let me guess. To get away from me.

01:28.210 --> 01:29.788
Get away from you?

01:29.857 --> 01:31.657
- A hundred percent.
- Uh-huh.

01:31.725 --> 01:34.059
Yeah, well,
it doesn't matter why you're going.

01:34.128 --> 01:35.461
You're going,

01:35.529 --> 01:38.130
which means I finally get
to have this place to myself.

01:40.167 --> 01:45.504
Isn't it funny when the animals
think that they run the zoo?

01:45.573 --> 01:47.005
I'll ask my parents to watch her.

01:47.074 --> 01:48.874
That's insane. It's only one night.

01:48.943 --> 01:50.209
I can be here alone.

01:50.277 --> 01:52.811
The Purge is only one night.

01:54.348 --> 01:57.382
And a lot of people
end up dead at the end.

01:59.000 --> 02:05.074
Advertise your product or brand here

02:06.477 --> 02:09.193
All right, listen up, you maggots.

02:10.110 --> 02:12.131
Every day you push me a little farther.

02:12.199 --> 02:14.466
Push, push, push.

02:14.535 --> 02:17.035
But one day you're gonna push too far.

02:17.104 --> 02:18.670
And then? Boom!

02:19.398 --> 02:20.906
I go off,

02:20.975 --> 02:24.743
and every maggot in a
ten-block radius goes with me.

02:24.812 --> 02:27.012
So what'd you think, girls?

02:27.081 --> 02:29.348
It was like my dad was in the room.

02:29.416 --> 02:31.350
I'm literally traumatized.

02:31.418 --> 02:35.053
Oh, I can't tell you how
happy that makes me feel.

02:35.995 --> 02:36.722
It'll even be better

02:36.790 --> 02:39.224
with the full uniform on.
What did you think, Shannon?

02:39.293 --> 02:41.860
I thought it was really good.
Just, if I had one thought,

02:41.929 --> 02:43.629
it's that my dad never
actually gets loud

02:43.697 --> 02:46.231
like that when he's angry.
He gets kind of quiet.

02:47.025 --> 02:48.400
Thank you, Shannon.

02:48.469 --> 02:51.670
I appreciate the constructive criticism.

02:53.407 --> 02:56.575
Now, if I could just offer a thought
on your weird, giant overalls...

02:56.644 --> 02:58.110
Walt.

02:59.197 --> 03:01.482
He is not the best at taking criticism.

03:01.517 --> 03:02.281
She's right.

03:03.071 --> 03:06.084
I'm sorry. I-I shouldn't have
made fun of your clothes.

03:06.153 --> 03:08.987
I mean, maybe you're baling hay
somewhere later, I don't know.

03:10.925 --> 03:14.293
Hey, Mom, Dad, uh,
we have a favor to ask.

03:14.361 --> 03:15.861
I'm taking Clem away this weekend,

03:15.930 --> 03:18.463
and we were wondering if
you minded watching Shannon.

03:18.532 --> 03:20.866
Uh, no. I told you, I can watch myself.

03:20.935 --> 03:23.802
Dad once left me alone
an entire weekend.

03:23.871 --> 03:26.171
There was a whole article
about it in the news.

03:27.541 --> 03:30.709
"Three-year-old calls 911."

03:31.838 --> 03:34.513
We would be happy to watch her for you.

03:34.582 --> 03:37.182
But I think Shannon deserves a chance.

03:37.251 --> 03:39.451
I mean, this young lady
is in the process

03:39.520 --> 03:42.754
of blooming, and you need
to water her with trust.

03:42.823 --> 03:45.224
Yeah!

03:46.111 --> 03:47.459
I don't know.

03:47.528 --> 03:49.394
Oh, come on, Clem.
If I wasn't responsible,

03:49.463 --> 03:52.331
would I have spent the whole
last summer cleaning up the park?

03:52.399 --> 03:54.399
That was court-mandated.

03:55.869 --> 03:59.938
She's 16 years old, guys.
She deserves a shot.

04:00.007 --> 04:01.740
Thank you, Rose.

04:01.809 --> 04:03.542
You're welcome,<i> bubelah.</i>

04:05.045 --> 04:06.612
What do you think, Nick?

04:07.127 --> 04:09.314
I mean, maybe my mom has a point.

04:09.383 --> 04:11.783
Besides, what's she gonna get into?

04:11.852 --> 04:13.785
Even bigger overalls?

04:15.155 --> 04:16.555
I'm done.

04:19.591 --> 04:21.760
Nick, this place is amazing.

04:21.829 --> 04:23.362
And you know what the best part is?

04:23.713 --> 04:24.930
See that girl over there?

04:24.999 --> 04:27.532
Not Shannon. That bellboy?

04:27.601 --> 04:29.668
Not Shannon. The woman who checked us in

04:29.737 --> 04:32.371
whose name was Shannon? Not Shannon.

04:32.439 --> 04:34.006
- It's just us.
- Mm-hmm.

04:35.743 --> 04:38.844
No way. Nick?

04:38.912 --> 04:40.245
Hey!

04:40.314 --> 04:42.648
This is crazy. It's been forever.

04:42.716 --> 04:45.450
Like a year.

04:47.087 --> 04:49.321
Hi, I'm Clem.

04:49.842 --> 04:51.456
Hi. Kristen.

04:51.525 --> 04:53.759
Oh, you're Nick's ex-girlfriend.

04:53.827 --> 04:56.762
That's right.
And this is my current fiancée Clem.

04:56.830 --> 04:58.630
"Current"?

04:59.593 --> 05:01.266
No. No.

05:01.335 --> 05:03.869
I mean, my current and future fiancée.

05:03.937 --> 05:05.219
I mean, until, you know, we get married.

05:05.273 --> 05:06.874
Then she'll be my current wife.

05:06.941 --> 05:10.008
Have y'all heard about
the seafood tower?

05:10.077 --> 05:12.644
There's a place in Chicago
that has a taller one. Hi.

05:12.713 --> 05:14.513
- I'm Charlie.
- This is my boyfriend.

05:14.581 --> 05:16.782
The law firm he works for just
transferred him from Chicago.

05:16.850 --> 05:18.404
Largest noncoastal city in the U.S.

05:18.519 --> 05:19.818
You're really proud of Chicago,
aren't you?

05:21.257 --> 05:23.755
So, it looks like you two
were on your way out of here.

05:23.824 --> 05:25.457
Shame we missed you.

05:25.526 --> 05:27.125
Bummed!

05:27.194 --> 05:29.061
No, we actually just checked in.

05:29.129 --> 05:31.963
Oh, us, too.
Looks like we'll be here together.

05:32.032 --> 05:34.232
Oh, which is awesome.

05:34.903 --> 05:37.502
You know what? We should all go
to dinner or something tomorrow.

05:37.571 --> 05:39.604
Oh, sounds terrific,
but we're only staying for the night.

05:39.673 --> 05:41.206
Damn, damn, damn!

05:41.275 --> 05:42.908
Well, then, how about we do it tonight?

05:42.976 --> 05:44.676
- Tonight? I don't think we'd...
- We'd love to.

05:44.745 --> 05:46.044
...be able to say no.

05:51.418 --> 05:53.352
I think the nutmeg wore off.

05:55.989 --> 05:58.590
Don't think it ever wore on.

05:58.659 --> 06:00.759
Yeah, I know.

06:00.828 --> 06:03.729
And now my head smells like Christmas.

06:03.997 --> 06:05.597
Well, we got to do something.

06:05.666 --> 06:07.432
I mean, this place is sick.

06:07.501 --> 06:09.277
We should get the old squad
over and have a rager.

06:09.337 --> 06:11.536
Yeah. I'm not really
feeling like raging.

06:11.605 --> 06:13.372
Maybe something on the more mellow side,

06:13.440 --> 06:14.873
like steal a bunch of shopping carts,

06:14.942 --> 06:16.875
push 'em into the river.

06:16.944 --> 06:20.045
Nah. Did that last night.

06:20.932 --> 06:23.415
Why don't you want
to have a party? I mean,

06:23.484 --> 06:25.550
what,
now that you're living in Fancy Town,

06:25.619 --> 06:27.185
- you think you're better than all of us?
- What?

06:27.254 --> 06:28.420
No.

06:28.489 --> 06:30.655
I do not think that I'm
better than you guys.

06:30.724 --> 06:32.758
And I don't even think you
guys are all that good.

06:32.826 --> 06:35.560
Well, the Shannon I knew
would throw a party.

06:35.629 --> 06:39.131
It's exactly what everyone said
would happen. You've changed.

06:39.199 --> 06:43.001
Changed? Excuse me, I have not changed.

06:43.070 --> 06:45.537
In fact, according
to my guidance counselor,

06:45.606 --> 06:48.306
I am getting worse.

06:50.377 --> 06:52.110
Then prove it.

06:52.179 --> 06:54.146
You know what? Fine.

06:54.214 --> 06:56.415
Let's do this. Text everybody

06:56.483 --> 06:59.217
- and tell them it's on.
- There's my girl.

06:59.286 --> 07:02.320
- I'm-a go get some beer.
- What's with the cookies?

07:02.389 --> 07:05.657
Homeless guy who buys
me beer loves them.

07:06.727 --> 07:10.762
I cannot believe you said yes to
having dinner with my ex-girlfriend.

07:10.831 --> 07:12.864
What else was I supposed to say?

07:12.933 --> 07:14.266
Oh, uh, what's that word again?

07:14.334 --> 07:16.301
Ah! I remember. "No."

07:18.172 --> 07:20.772
Look, if you're worried
about me, don't be.

07:20.841 --> 07:23.442
- I'm totally cool and okay with this.
- Yeah.

07:23.510 --> 07:24.810
But <i> I'm</i> not cool and okay.

07:24.878 --> 07:26.745
I'm uncool and un-okay.

07:28.330 --> 07:30.148
Disokay.

07:30.217 --> 07:32.150
Nokay.

07:32.219 --> 07:34.152
Relax. It's gonna be fun.

07:34.221 --> 07:36.354
I've never met any of your exes.

07:36.423 --> 07:37.789
I mean, there's only five of them.

07:37.858 --> 07:39.524
They're like white rhinos.

07:40.379 --> 07:41.193
Fine.

07:41.261 --> 07:43.012
If I'm gonna relax, I'm gonna pregame.

07:43.341 --> 07:44.704
I'm drinking this whole bottle of wine.

07:44.798 --> 07:46.798
Don't you try to stop me.

07:47.628 --> 07:49.201
How do I look?

07:49.269 --> 07:51.269
You look amazing.

07:51.338 --> 07:53.772
Good, 'cause I got to bring my "A" game.

07:53.841 --> 07:56.308
- You never mentioned that Kristen was so pretty.
- Okay.

07:56.376 --> 07:57.742
And in what situation
would that have come up?

07:57.811 --> 08:01.146
"Oh, hey, Clem, I ever tell you
that my ex is super hot?"

08:02.216 --> 08:04.483
Okay, I said "pretty."

08:05.586 --> 08:07.886
You're right. This gonna be so fun.

08:13.444 --> 08:14.843
♪ Let's go, come get a sneak peek ♪

08:14.912 --> 08:16.178
♪ Can't touch me like... ♪

08:17.582 --> 08:19.281
Wow, you're really good at beer pong.

08:19.350 --> 08:21.283
Yeah, my dad taught me
how to play when I was 13.

08:21.352 --> 08:24.153
- We used Kool-Aid. Winner got a beer.
- Ah!

08:24.221 --> 08:26.155
Nice!

08:27.224 --> 08:28.991
Hey, Shannon.

08:30.094 --> 08:32.394
Evan.

08:32.462 --> 08:34.597
What are you doing here?

08:34.664 --> 08:36.631
It sounded like you were having a party,

08:36.701 --> 08:39.400
so I thought I'd do
the old neighbor pop-in.

08:39.876 --> 08:41.937
Pop!

08:42.006 --> 08:45.207
Okay, fine, you can stay.
Under one condition.

08:46.477 --> 08:48.277
You promise me you'll
never tell Nick and Clem

08:48.346 --> 08:49.411
that I had a party.

08:50.251 --> 08:51.046
Wait.

08:51.082 --> 08:52.948
You're not supposed
to be having a party?

08:53.017 --> 08:55.217
Well, they kind of made me swear

08:55.286 --> 08:58.754
that I wouldn't,
so it's a little bit of a gray area.

08:59.469 --> 09:02.091
Wow. I could never do that.

09:02.159 --> 09:03.892
I'd feel way too guilty.

09:03.961 --> 09:05.694
What do I have to feel guilty about?

09:05.763 --> 09:08.464
Well, they took you into
their home and trusted you.

09:08.532 --> 09:10.432
And now you're betraying them,

09:10.501 --> 09:13.035
like Judas.

09:13.104 --> 09:16.005
A sexy Judas.

09:17.108 --> 09:19.375
Am I Judas?

09:19.443 --> 09:22.778
Dude, this party's so fun.
Aren't you glad you did this?

09:22.847 --> 09:24.013
Well, I don't feel guilty,

09:24.081 --> 09:26.148
if that's what you're insinuating,
Janelle.

09:29.253 --> 09:31.687
So sexy.

09:33.691 --> 09:35.624
So, how did you guys meet?

09:35.693 --> 09:38.494
Well, my firm was hired to sue
the company Kristen works for,

09:38.562 --> 09:41.497
and after a borderline
unprofessional deposition,

09:41.565 --> 09:43.966
she asked me to dinner,
and the rest is history.

09:44.035 --> 09:47.903
Wow, that sounds...
borderline unethical.

09:47.972 --> 09:49.638
Oh, it totally was.

09:49.707 --> 09:51.106
But we've now been
dating for eight months.

09:51.175 --> 09:52.474
We're thinking about moving in together,

09:52.543 --> 09:54.343
but someone's dragging her feet.

09:55.446 --> 09:56.945
It's Kristen.

09:57.657 --> 09:58.447
Sorry,

09:58.516 --> 10:01.250
but it didn't go so well the
last time I lived with someone.

10:01.318 --> 10:02.818
Right, Nick?

10:02.887 --> 10:04.920
Oh. You guys...

10:04.989 --> 10:06.288
lived together?

10:06.357 --> 10:08.657
Uh... yeah, but, you know, it was...

10:09.187 --> 10:10.959
it was not that long.

10:11.028 --> 10:12.961
Uh, six months is a pretty long time,

10:13.030 --> 10:15.097
especially when you're
sleeping next to a pillow hog.

10:15.166 --> 10:16.432
Right, Clem?

10:18.335 --> 10:20.936
In the same place that we live in now?

10:21.885 --> 10:23.539
Yeah. I'm sure I mentioned that, right?

10:23.607 --> 10:25.374
I mean... you must have,

10:25.443 --> 10:28.677
because if you didn't,
that definitely would be...

10:28.746 --> 10:30.045
nokay.

10:33.373 --> 10:35.752
Okay, people, hi.

10:35.787 --> 10:36.785
Quick announcement:

10:36.854 --> 10:39.121
if you're gonna throw up,
please do it in the bathroom

10:39.190 --> 10:41.123
and not behind the piano...

10:41.192 --> 10:42.658
Elizabeth.

10:45.596 --> 10:47.529
Hey, Brian, hi. How are you?

10:47.598 --> 10:49.431
Have you ever heard of a coaster?

10:49.500 --> 10:50.866
Great. Use one.

10:55.873 --> 10:57.139
Hello.

10:57.208 --> 10:58.640
Hey, sweetie. It's Rose.

10:58.709 --> 10:59.908
Rose, hey!

10:59.977 --> 11:02.444
Uh... what's going on?

11:02.513 --> 11:04.546
What's all that noise?

11:04.615 --> 11:06.715
Nothing. It's just
this-this movie I'm watching

11:06.784 --> 11:09.184
about crowds and...

11:09.253 --> 11:11.186
what it's like to be in one.

11:12.957 --> 11:15.235
If you just give me one second,
I'm gonna put you on a brief hold,

11:15.260 --> 11:18.427
and I'll get right back to you. Okay.

11:21.118 --> 11:22.831
So, hey, Rose. What's up?

11:22.900 --> 11:25.134
Just checking, making sure you're okay.

11:25.202 --> 11:28.537
You know, considering Walt and I
went out on a limb for you.

11:28.606 --> 11:31.039
Yeah, you did,
and I-I really appreciated it.

11:31.108 --> 11:32.741
Oh, yeah, everything's great.

11:32.810 --> 11:33.876
Oh!

11:35.412 --> 11:36.278
What was that?

11:36.347 --> 11:38.655
Nothing. Just the neighbor's
cat came through the window.

11:38.683 --> 11:41.517
Get out of here, you pervert cat!

11:42.753 --> 11:46.088
Well, I'm so happy
that they trusted you.

11:46.157 --> 11:48.390
You should be proud of yourself.

11:48.459 --> 11:49.424
Yeah.

11:49.493 --> 11:51.627
I really am.

11:51.695 --> 11:53.395
Thanks for calling.

11:53.464 --> 11:54.596
Bye.

11:54.765 --> 11:55.964
Bye.

11:59.870 --> 12:01.303
So, she having a party?

12:01.372 --> 12:03.572
<i>Major</i> party.

12:05.576 --> 12:09.111
Sounds like Studio 55 over there.

12:09.180 --> 12:10.813
Don't you mean 54?

12:10.881 --> 12:13.081
No. Bigger, baby.

12:15.152 --> 12:17.753
I got to be honest,
I thought that seafood tower

12:17.822 --> 12:19.321
was gonna be a little bit taller.

12:19.968 --> 12:20.823
I mean, come on, chef,

12:20.891 --> 12:22.791
add some prawns, you know what I mean?

12:25.354 --> 12:26.261
Right, Clem?

12:27.144 --> 12:28.063
Right?

12:28.132 --> 12:30.065
Please say something.

12:30.167 --> 12:33.502
I can't believe that you and Kristen
lived together in our apartment.

12:33.571 --> 12:35.003
And for six months!

12:35.072 --> 12:37.139
Come on, babe, that's not a long time.

12:37.208 --> 12:39.641
Especially when you consider
one of those months was February.

12:39.710 --> 12:42.411
How could you not tell me about this?

12:42.479 --> 12:44.599
I'm sorry. I really am.

12:44.634 --> 12:46.048
But in my defense,
when we first started dating,

12:46.116 --> 12:48.650
you made a rule that we
don't talk about our pasts.

12:48.719 --> 12:50.619
Yes, because I didn't want
to talk about <i> my</i> past.

12:50.688 --> 12:52.588
It never occurred to me
that <i> you</i> had a past.

12:53.724 --> 12:55.257
Well, of course I do.

12:55.326 --> 12:57.459
I mean, I had a life before you, Clem.

12:57.528 --> 13:00.329
A sheltered, you know,
often sexually frustrated one,

13:00.397 --> 13:02.564
but, yes, a past.

13:02.633 --> 13:06.869
So, wait, is our bed the same bed
that you and Kristen slept in?

13:06.937 --> 13:08.437
No, no, no. She took the bed.

13:08.505 --> 13:11.073
Our bed is new.
I mean... it's not, like,<i> totally</i> new.

13:11.141 --> 13:12.085
It was in my parents' guest room,

13:12.176 --> 13:14.943
so some cousins got busy on it,
but that's family.

13:15.012 --> 13:17.646
What about the couch that
we sit on every night...

13:17.715 --> 13:20.182
and watch TV and snuggle on?

13:20.251 --> 13:22.317
Did you get busy on that, too?

13:23.420 --> 13:25.921
I mean, it <i> is</i> Scotchgarded.

13:27.024 --> 13:29.591
I feel like I need to take a shower.

13:29.660 --> 13:31.526
Well, baby, you know,
there's two showerheads in there

13:31.595 --> 13:32.961
- if you want...
- I need 'em both!

13:38.068 --> 13:39.635
What is this?

13:41.739 --> 13:45.340
It's like the tiny wine bottle,
but it's full of shampoo?

13:45.409 --> 13:47.843
The only other place that
I've seen tiny bottles

13:47.912 --> 13:51.179
of Le Labo shampoo is under
the bathroom sink at home.

13:51.248 --> 13:53.315
Have you stayed here before?

13:53.384 --> 13:54.750
Uh...

13:54.818 --> 13:57.019
not in <i> this</i> room.

13:57.087 --> 13:59.721
Have you stayed here
with Kristen before?

13:59.790 --> 14:02.591
Not in <i> this</i> room.

14:02.660 --> 14:04.426
Oh, my God, you're unbelievable.

14:04.495 --> 14:06.662
It's just a stupid hotel.
It's not like this was

14:06.730 --> 14:08.263
a special place for me and Kristen.

14:08.332 --> 14:09.765
Yeah, well, maybe I thought it was

14:09.833 --> 14:11.833
- a special place for me and you.
- Come on, Clem.

14:11.902 --> 14:14.036
And now I find out that
you've been here with <i> her?</i>

14:14.104 --> 14:16.004
And about the apartment? I mean...

14:16.073 --> 14:18.140
I-I'm sorry, I just, I guess...

14:18.208 --> 14:20.409
this isn't the night
that I was hoping for.

14:21.225 --> 14:22.444
So what are you saying?

14:22.513 --> 14:25.514
What has two thumbs
and wants to go home?

14:27.518 --> 14:28.750
E.T.?

14:30.654 --> 14:32.287
I'll just go pack my bag.

14:38.778 --> 14:41.345
Are you still mad at me?
Y-You barely said anything

14:41.414 --> 14:43.514
- the whole way home.
- Mad at you?

14:44.157 --> 14:46.117
No.

14:46.185 --> 14:48.719
Really? Because when we were
listening to that true crime podcast,

14:48.788 --> 14:52.323
it seemed like you were rooting for
the lady who murdered her husband.

14:52.392 --> 14:55.526
I wasn't rooting for her.

14:55.595 --> 14:58.296
I just thought she brought
up some valid points.

15:00.877 --> 15:02.533
Where's that music coming from?

15:02.602 --> 15:05.336
Oh. Cool. Are you the weed delivery guy?

15:06.439 --> 15:07.772
No.

15:08.563 --> 15:10.708
Are <i> you</i> the weed delivery guy?

15:12.979 --> 15:14.912
♪ Let's get it on... ♪

15:14.981 --> 15:16.480
What the hell?

15:16.549 --> 15:17.548
Oh, God.

15:17.617 --> 15:18.616
Shannon!

15:18.685 --> 15:20.384
I will explain everything
in the other room.

15:20.453 --> 15:22.386
Okay? Come on, come on.

15:23.007 --> 15:24.956
Hey, we get a free lighter
with our order, right?

15:25.024 --> 15:28.125
I am not the weed delivery guy!

15:28.194 --> 15:30.695
What the hell were you thinking,
Shannon?

15:30.763 --> 15:33.230
You promised us we could trust you.

15:33.299 --> 15:35.866
And you promised me you'd
be out of town for 24 hours,

15:35.935 --> 15:38.970
so, yes, mistakes were made all around.

15:39.038 --> 15:40.705
Well, I hope you had fun,

15:40.773 --> 15:42.673
because we are never trusting you again.

15:42.742 --> 15:44.575
That's the thing, I didn't have fun.

15:44.644 --> 15:46.110
Well, at first I did.
Beer pong champion.

15:48.681 --> 15:49.814
I mean...

15:49.882 --> 15:51.549
ginger ale pong champion.

15:53.086 --> 15:55.353
But then I started feeling
terrible about myself.

15:55.421 --> 15:57.288
Because you knew you weren't
supposed to be doing this.

15:57.357 --> 15:59.690
Right. I screwed up.
But usually I don't realize that

15:59.759 --> 16:02.193
until you guys come home
and rip me a new one.

16:02.261 --> 16:04.528
But this time...
dude, I'm way ahead of you.

16:04.597 --> 16:06.631
I ripped <i> myself</i> a new one.

16:07.530 --> 16:10.201
I mean, it's not the most
eloquent way to put it...

16:10.269 --> 16:14.238
My point is, this is real progress.

16:14.307 --> 16:15.840
Now...

16:15.908 --> 16:17.908
am I a hero?

16:19.712 --> 16:21.812
That's not for me to say.

16:23.650 --> 16:26.450
But did I go on a hero's journey?

16:29.155 --> 16:31.255
I feel like yes.

16:32.592 --> 16:33.791
Look, Shannon,

16:33.860 --> 16:35.960
it's great to see you
recognizing your own mistakes,

16:36.029 --> 16:38.729
but that doesn't get you off
the hook for what you've done.

16:38.798 --> 16:40.197
I know. I was being dumb.

16:40.266 --> 16:42.667
I was just so concerned about
what my friends thought of me.

16:42.735 --> 16:45.770
But then I realized I care
more about what you guys think.

16:47.373 --> 16:50.841
Anyways, I'm genuinely sorry
about messing up your place, Nick.

16:50.910 --> 16:52.843
You don't get it, Shannon.

16:52.912 --> 16:56.013
It's... it's not only <i> my</i> place.

16:56.082 --> 17:00.317
You live here just as much as I do,
just as much as Clem does.

17:01.493 --> 17:02.653
We're a family.

17:02.722 --> 17:05.589
And you have to respect this place.

17:05.657 --> 17:07.258
Not because it's mine.

17:07.359 --> 17:09.126
Because it's all of ours.

17:10.896 --> 17:13.396
Yo! The cops are here!

17:13.465 --> 17:15.098
Cops?

17:15.167 --> 17:18.669
All right, listen up, you maggots!

17:21.607 --> 17:22.873
Every day...

17:22.942 --> 17:24.575
you punks push me a little farther.

17:24.644 --> 17:27.211
Push, push, push.

17:28.981 --> 17:32.083
And one day you're gonna push too far,

17:32.151 --> 17:34.452
and then...

17:34.520 --> 17:36.787
boom...

17:36.856 --> 17:41.759
I go off, and every maggot
in a ten-block radius

17:41.828 --> 17:43.794
goes down with me. Boom!

17:51.637 --> 17:54.071
Dude... that was killer.

17:56.209 --> 17:58.409
Well, I, uh, played it quiet,

17:58.478 --> 17:59.910
like you suggested,

17:59.979 --> 18:01.879
and, uh, guess what.

18:01.948 --> 18:03.614
I got the part!

18:03.683 --> 18:04.982
- No!
- Yeah!

18:06.853 --> 18:08.119
Congrats, Dad.

18:08.187 --> 18:09.987
Uh, what are you doing here?

18:10.056 --> 18:13.290
Hey, uh, Nick and Clem,
I didn't realize you were back.

18:13.359 --> 18:16.327
Well, your mom figured that
Shannon was having a party,

18:16.395 --> 18:20.564
and I figured that this would be
the funnest way to break it up.

18:20.633 --> 18:22.767
If you guys knew Shannon
was having a party,

18:22.835 --> 18:24.135
why didn't you call us?

18:24.203 --> 18:25.603
I bet it was

18:25.671 --> 18:28.239
so he could clean everything
up before we came back home.

18:28.307 --> 18:30.641
Right, Dad?
So you and Mom wouldn't have to admit

18:30.710 --> 18:32.309
that you were wrong
about trusting Shannon.

18:32.378 --> 18:35.513
Okay,
I do not appreciate that accusation.

18:35.581 --> 18:38.649
Okay, y'all,
let's get this place cleaned up...

18:41.854 --> 18:43.788
Damn!

18:48.361 --> 18:51.830
You know, it looks like a
fraternity exploded in here,

18:51.898 --> 18:56.301
and yet Kristen's couch
is miraculously unscathed.

18:56.369 --> 18:59.938
You know what? Why don't you and I
go pick out a new couch together?

19:00.006 --> 19:03.341
No. The couch stays.

19:04.611 --> 19:06.978
This feels like a trap.

19:07.047 --> 19:09.147
It's not a trap.

19:09.216 --> 19:11.583
It just hurt to find
out that this place,

19:11.651 --> 19:13.585
which I always thought was <i> ours,</i>

19:13.653 --> 19:15.653
used to be yours with someone else.

19:15.722 --> 19:17.655
But what you said to Shannon,

19:17.724 --> 19:20.225
it really made this place feel...

19:20.293 --> 19:21.826
like home.

19:22.573 --> 19:24.095
So the couch stays.

19:24.862 --> 19:26.130
I don't understand.

19:26.199 --> 19:29.133
From now on,
it will be a symbol of our ability

19:29.202 --> 19:31.169
to move past problems.

19:31.238 --> 19:32.770
I love that.

19:32.839 --> 19:36.140
But I'm still a little
on guard about that trap.

19:38.311 --> 19:39.911
Full disclosure,

19:39.980 --> 19:42.547
since I'm all mature now and whatnot:

19:42.616 --> 19:44.749
some beer spilt on the couch.

19:44.818 --> 19:47.585
Okay. Thank you
for being honest with us.

19:47.654 --> 19:49.320
Even fuller disclosure:

19:49.389 --> 19:52.490
the beer used to be
in Elizabeth's stomach.

19:55.362 --> 19:57.762
Good thing I Scotchgarded it, right?

20:02.035 --> 20:03.301
- Ew!
- Oh, yuck!
