00:00.422 --> 00:03.227
<i>A few months ago
I discovered I have a twin sister</i>

00:03.273 --> 00:05.119
<i>and then she asked me to take her place,</i>

00:05.461 --> 00:07.331
<i>keep the secret, find our real mother</i>

00:07.372 --> 00:09.264
<i>and try to stay alive.</i>

00:09.310 --> 00:11.653
<i>Put yourself in my shoes.</i>

00:12.299 --> 00:14.530
<i>How long could you keep up the lying game?</i>

00:15.172 --> 00:16.406
<i>Previously on The Lying Game:</i>

00:16.440 --> 00:18.079
This is Annie Sewell.

00:18.107 --> 00:19.238
It's Rebecca now.

00:19.276 --> 00:21.075
You want to keep the past in the past?

00:21.140 --> 00:22.099
Do you think that's possible?

00:22.133 --> 00:23.251
I'd like nothing better.

00:23.285 --> 00:25.072
I lost your mother's bracelet.

00:25.112 --> 00:26.277
<i>She was wearing it the day that she died.</i>

00:26.311 --> 00:28.160
<i>You're getting soft, man.</i>

00:28.204 --> 00:30.205
Go in there right now
and break up with her.

00:38.142 --> 00:41.087
Her car is missing.
Sutton is missing.

00:41.112 --> 00:42.511
This your family's car, Sutton?

00:42.706 --> 00:45.201
Let's see what's inside.

00:45.254 --> 00:47.289
Dan, I took the car, okay?

00:47.323 --> 00:48.434
I haven't seen you guys since

00:48.457 --> 00:50.336
Santa Barbara...
got to be 20 years.

00:50.370 --> 00:52.173
- Annie, right?
- Kristin.

00:52.215 --> 00:53.606
I just found this on the back walk.

00:56.623 --> 00:58.389
"Keep on being Sutton or you're next"

01:00.060 --> 01:02.044
"Keep on being Sutton or you're next"

01:03.621 --> 01:04.998
Oh, my God.

01:05.815 --> 01:07.003
And here we go.

01:07.567 --> 01:09.545
This is not cool.

01:10.171 --> 01:10.938
Not cool?

01:11.770 --> 01:13.037
Ethan, this is terrifying.

01:14.828 --> 01:17.114
"Keep on being Sutton or you're next"?

01:17.217 --> 01:17.823
I...

01:18.157 --> 01:19.534
No, we have to tell somebody.

01:19.837 --> 01:21.652
Guys, guys, we don't want to overreact.

01:21.812 --> 01:22.804
I hear you.

01:25.353 --> 01:26.935
Did you not read this?

01:27.005 --> 01:29.011
I shouldn't even be touching it.
It could be evidence.

01:29.038 --> 01:30.623
The thing is, the person most likely

01:30.645 --> 01:31.709
to write that note is Sutton.

01:31.906 --> 01:32.877
Em, this feels

01:33.051 --> 01:34.799
like a lying game.
Why play one now?

01:34.833 --> 01:37.819
She was on her way
to the party to expose us.

01:37.853 --> 01:39.630
Maybe she found a nastier way to do it.

01:40.728 --> 01:42.718
Look. All right.

01:42.748 --> 01:46.710
There's something you need
to understand about her, okay?

01:46.715 --> 01:48.729
Sutton pulled a lying game

01:48.761 --> 01:50.765
on this transfer girl a few years ago.

01:50.767 --> 01:52.015
She was from back East.

01:52.049 --> 01:53.765
Apparently, she wasn't treating Sutton

01:53.821 --> 01:55.821
with the deference that
she felt she was owed.

01:55.823 --> 01:58.859
So she would... steal things from her,

01:58.893 --> 02:01.754
like, uh, earrings,
cell phone, her retainer.

02:01.788 --> 02:03.581
Hillary... that was her name. Yeah.

02:03.697 --> 02:05.733
Soon as Hillary would replace the things,

02:05.760 --> 02:08.525
Sutton would send
the original one back to her

02:08.559 --> 02:09.934
wrapped up like a present,

02:10.050 --> 02:11.467
cryptic notes attached to them,

02:11.612 --> 02:12.936
warning her to be more careful or whatever.

02:12.938 --> 02:14.665
And it was just little things.

02:14.732 --> 02:15.955
Enough to make her look like a fool.

02:16.021 --> 02:17.661
And it worked... I mean, the girl

02:17.663 --> 02:18.724
ended up transferring to another school.

02:18.828 --> 02:20.767
So Sutton won.

02:22.752 --> 02:25.605
Okay, that's horrible...
no question...

02:25.630 --> 02:28.897
but we're dealing
with a missing person here.

02:28.931 --> 02:31.440
We have a scrap of a dress.

02:31.474 --> 02:32.893
This is a little bit more serious.

02:32.927 --> 02:34.940
Yeah, but all the presents she sent...

02:34.972 --> 02:36.708
white paper, black bow.

02:36.710 --> 02:38.814
Right. This...
this became

02:38.841 --> 02:40.689
her thing, her signature.

02:40.720 --> 02:43.563
Which is why, for now, I say we lay low

02:43.597 --> 02:44.969
and just see what her next move is.

02:45.036 --> 02:47.048
So I'm just supposed to go to school

02:47.050 --> 02:48.652
and pretend I'm not freaking out? Yeah.

02:48.725 --> 02:50.637
Guys, I have a really bad
feeling about this.

02:50.671 --> 02:51.938
I know it's hard,

02:51.940 --> 02:54.635
but we need to try
and act normal for right now...

02:54.669 --> 02:56.669
- till we get this thing figured out.
- He's right.

02:56.829 --> 02:58.625
Because the only way to win a lying game

02:58.653 --> 02:59.882
is not to play.

03:32.890 --> 03:34.645
Well if it isn't Danica Patrick.

03:36.181 --> 03:37.118
Pull up a chair.

03:39.260 --> 03:40.986
I'm actually late.

03:41.568 --> 03:42.752
Well, then, we'll make it quick.

03:42.754 --> 03:43.546
Sit.

03:46.560 --> 03:48.728
Is this about the car?

03:48.761 --> 03:50.577
- Yes.
- No. No.

03:50.598 --> 03:52.492
- Yes.
- No, it's... no, it's about the car

03:52.522 --> 03:54.685
and college and tennis
and your whole future, Sutton.

03:54.719 --> 03:55.818
Dad, please.

03:55.904 --> 03:57.836
I know this was a big deal,

03:57.864 --> 04:00.580
and I'm not trying to get out
of a punishment or anything,

04:00.597 --> 04:01.776
but I also don't want you to read

04:01.880 --> 04:03.571
any more into it.
It was a huge mistake.

04:03.749 --> 04:07.406
Just one last thing before turning 17.

04:07.424 --> 04:09.837
And... I will pay for it
with my own money.

04:09.875 --> 04:11.623
This isn't about the money.

04:11.678 --> 04:13.810
Although we appreciate you
taking responsibility.

04:13.812 --> 04:16.519
I promise, it will never happen again.

04:18.120 --> 04:19.699
HELP!"

04:19.765 --> 04:21.813
I really have to go.

04:21.855 --> 04:23.601
We're not done talking about this.

04:23.639 --> 04:25.884
Okay.

04:27.889 --> 04:30.475
Hey. I got Char's text.

04:30.526 --> 04:31.811
What happened?

04:31.859 --> 04:34.764
We just spent a half hour
reeling in Phyllis...

04:34.779 --> 04:36.489
soused on a pool raft.

04:36.532 --> 04:38.435
<i>It was like an episode of Celebrity Rehab</i>

04:38.450 --> 04:39.569
without the celebrity.

04:39.603 --> 04:42.570
Yeah. Happy hour
came early for her.

04:42.604 --> 04:44.440
Char left messages for her dad,

04:44.455 --> 04:45.772
but he's at some conference in Miami.

04:45.790 --> 04:47.627
For a change.
Oh.

04:47.663 --> 04:49.579
I wish Char could just stay with me.

04:49.613 --> 04:50.828
Yeah, not happening.

04:50.878 --> 04:52.501
Phyllis can't stand your mom.

04:52.556 --> 04:55.545
Or my dad, so my place is out, too.

04:56.832 --> 04:58.756
You know, one totally cool person

04:58.790 --> 05:00.633
so far in all this has been Rebecca.

05:01.791 --> 05:03.558
She's really pushing Char's dad

05:03.590 --> 05:05.757
to let her stay here with her,
but, then, Phyllis

05:05.791 --> 05:08.465
barely speaks to Rebecca,
so... it's crazy.

05:08.476 --> 05:09.680
They were all actually
friends at one point.

05:09.739 --> 05:11.595
Please tell me that we're not going to get

05:11.629 --> 05:13.513
all dysfunctional and nasty
when we hit middle age.

05:13.579 --> 05:14.649
No way.

05:14.688 --> 05:15.797
Mom, wait!

05:19.525 --> 05:21.494
Poor Char.

05:21.535 --> 05:22.832
It's a lot to handle alone.

05:28.619 --> 05:30.615
I'll see you in a little bit, okay?

05:30.649 --> 05:34.624
So, someone bolted out of
the house this morning

05:34.658 --> 05:38.762
after receiving a very
mysterious and urgent text.

05:38.789 --> 05:40.798
Oh. That was Char.

05:40.832 --> 05:43.495
She just needed help with her mom.

05:44.835 --> 05:46.604
Okay, don't tell me.

05:46.629 --> 05:47.685
I really don't care.

05:47.715 --> 05:49.552
Laurel, wait...

05:49.607 --> 05:51.644
I want to be able
to tell you everything. I...

05:51.678 --> 05:53.517
Hey, there you are.

05:53.532 --> 05:54.679
So I called my dad to see

05:54.696 --> 05:56.440
if he could help out with the whole...

05:56.488 --> 05:57.540
Char sitch.

05:57.568 --> 05:58.816
I mean, I feel so bad for her.

05:58.850 --> 06:00.449
She's got no one and...

06:02.480 --> 06:03.561
Oh, my God.

06:03.563 --> 06:04.700
What?

06:04.702 --> 06:06.665
Look who's back in school.

06:09.743 --> 06:11.791
This jerk breaks Char's heart,
then thinks he can just

06:11.827 --> 06:14.711
strut around school like nothing happened?

06:18.472 --> 06:19.635
Hey!

06:19.669 --> 06:21.813
Derek!

06:21.836 --> 06:23.666
Hello!

06:23.700 --> 06:25.810
Sutton.

06:25.835 --> 06:28.594
What are you...
what are you doing here?

06:28.639 --> 06:30.441
What, did you think you
could just get away with it

06:30.477 --> 06:31.539
without anybody saying anything to you?

06:31.574 --> 06:33.693
You don't know the whole story.

06:33.727 --> 06:35.854
I want you to tell me what
happened the night of my party.

06:36.853 --> 06:38.614
Look, what do you want from me?

06:38.652 --> 06:40.826
I want you to apologize.

06:40.855 --> 06:43.445
I want you to beg for forgiveness.

06:43.493 --> 06:44.820
I mean, you really hurt a girl

06:44.860 --> 06:46.693
who deserves way better

06:46.727 --> 06:48.559
than the way you've treated her.

06:48.590 --> 06:49.839
Char?

06:49.865 --> 06:51.501
Yes, Char!

06:51.531 --> 06:52.793
Her life just imploded,

06:52.836 --> 06:54.754
and you couldn't even pick up a phone?

06:54.794 --> 06:56.627
Really?

06:56.672 --> 06:59.128
Classy, Derek. Classy.

07:00.774 --> 07:02.388
- Hey. Hey.
- Hi.

07:03.616 --> 07:04.918
What's going on with Trans Am over there?

07:04.952 --> 07:06.852
Nothing.
It's just, he...

07:08.121 --> 07:09.785
- Nothing.
- Okay.

07:10.142 --> 07:11.227
- Hey.
- Hmm?

07:11.276 --> 07:12.477
It's going to be all right.

07:12.701 --> 07:13.318
All right?

07:13.417 --> 07:15.161
Yeah, you wouldn't be so relaxed

07:15.206 --> 07:17.959
if the note said you are next.

07:18.464 --> 07:19.447
<i>I guess I'm saying,</i>

07:19.850 --> 07:21.210
now at least it seems like she's back

07:21.211 --> 07:23.620
to being a typical teenager, warts and all.

07:24.936 --> 07:27.128
Maybe trashing cars is some sign

07:27.129 --> 07:28.513
of a return to normalcy.

07:29.048 --> 07:30.535
Well, it's not exactly what I want

07:30.536 --> 07:31.835
to put in the Christmas letter.

07:31.836 --> 07:33.247
Hey, I'll take harebrained teen

07:33.248 --> 07:34.845
over sullen, depressive any day.

07:35.246 --> 07:36.296
Rebecca?

07:37.741 --> 07:38.424
Hi.

07:38.713 --> 07:39.992
Hi.
Oh.

07:40.148 --> 07:41.565
Hey, Rebecca.

07:41.889 --> 07:42.839
What a nice surprise.

07:43.231 --> 07:43.929
Isn't it?

07:45.342 --> 07:46.258
Why don't you go on?

07:46.259 --> 07:47.193
I'll catch up with you.

07:47.409 --> 07:48.954
Oh. Okay.

07:50.889 --> 07:52.523
I'm just so glad to see you here.

07:52.524 --> 07:53.458
I can't imagine you've had

07:53.459 --> 07:55.174
much time to relax since being back.

07:56.094 --> 07:58.226
Yeah, it's been a little crazy.

07:58.259 --> 08:00.191
We're just all trying

08:00.225 --> 08:02.410
to figure out the best solution for Char.

08:02.533 --> 08:03.776
It's never simple.

08:03.777 --> 08:05.654
Nothing is ever simple with kids.

08:06.041 --> 08:08.200
Oh, well, of course, you would know.

08:08.318 --> 08:09.097
Mm.

08:09.720 --> 08:11.885
So you're applying for membership?

08:12.333 --> 08:14.855
Yeah, I thought it would be
a good way to meet people.

08:14.856 --> 08:17.550
You know, I moved away
to California 20 years ago,

08:17.551 --> 08:19.311
so all of my friends are gone.

08:19.521 --> 08:20.597
Well, it can't be easy.

08:20.598 --> 08:22.572
I mean, I think everyone we know

08:22.573 --> 08:24.817
is through our kids' school and activities.

08:24.818 --> 08:27.082
So I guess I should find some kids.

08:30.129 --> 08:31.562
Well, while you're looking,

08:31.563 --> 08:33.644
please feel free to use us as a source.

08:33.645 --> 08:35.294
That's very kind of you.

08:35.698 --> 08:36.378
Thank you.

08:36.395 --> 08:38.011
I was wanting to ask you something.

08:38.013 --> 08:39.511
We have an anniversary coming up,

08:39.513 --> 08:41.133
and I was wanting to surprise Ted

08:41.134 --> 08:42.756
with a California escape.

08:42.758 --> 08:44.724
- Any suggestions?
- Yeah.

08:45.029 --> 08:48.038
There's Big Sur and Palm Springs.

08:48.072 --> 08:49.022
Napa.

08:49.537 --> 08:51.010
What about Santa Barbara?

08:51.575 --> 08:52.322
Huh.

08:53.052 --> 08:55.508
You know, that is the one place
I've never been.

09:12.804 --> 09:14.356
Sutton, playoffs are coming up.

09:14.946 --> 09:15.939
Get your head in the drill.

09:15.940 --> 09:17.429
Get your head in the drill now.

09:32.729 --> 09:34.723
Hey. Hey.
You all right?

09:34.742 --> 09:35.931
You okay out there?

09:39.231 --> 09:41.732
What's... what...

09:41.747 --> 09:43.889
What do you want from me?

09:43.907 --> 09:45.927
Hey, Sutton. Sutton! Hey, Ted.

09:45.947 --> 09:47.165
Hey, how are you, guy?
I'm good.

09:47.201 --> 09:48.866
I don't think Sutton remembers me, though.

09:48.900 --> 09:50.038
I guess not.

09:50.072 --> 09:51.116
Sectionals last spring?

09:51.182 --> 09:54.078
Right. Right. I'm sorry.

09:54.096 --> 09:55.967
I... Listen, I'm sure
you've seen many coaches.

09:55.969 --> 09:57.761
Hey, but, you know, TSNU's still

09:57.790 --> 09:59.746
at the top of our list.
Go, Copperheads!

09:59.755 --> 10:00.936
Spoken like a die-hard alum
right there.

10:00.970 --> 10:02.226
But we'd like to hear it from the player

10:02.260 --> 10:03.889
who's applying.

10:03.923 --> 10:05.013
Right, yeah.

10:05.051 --> 10:07.190
It sounds like a...
great school.

10:07.223 --> 10:09.050
Yeah, Randy, this is Sutton's friend,

10:09.084 --> 10:10.927
uh, Ethan Whitehorse.

10:10.940 --> 10:12.187
Sir.
How you doing, son?

10:12.672 --> 10:14.609
Randy Taylor, assistant coach,
women tennis,

10:14.610 --> 10:16.196
Texas Sutter North University.

10:16.258 --> 10:17.667
I'm in town unofficially,

10:17.668 --> 10:19.822
in no way violating
any recruiting restrictions.

10:20.037 --> 10:20.862
Ah!

10:20.863 --> 10:22.684
So you mean you're not offering us a car?

10:23.035 --> 10:24.555
It's good to know we're still
on your dance card.

10:24.737 --> 10:27.148
So, I guess the next step
would be to get you out there.

10:27.167 --> 10:29.712
You know, meet the coaches, watch practice,

10:29.713 --> 10:32.062
- maybe talk to admissions?
- Sure, of course. Yeah.

10:32.063 --> 10:34.372
Yeah, we'll look at our
schedule, pick some dates.

10:34.661 --> 10:35.819
By the time you apply, we're going to have

10:35.820 --> 10:37.317
eight new scholarship spots.

10:37.318 --> 10:39.046
Four of those are free ride,

10:39.047 --> 10:41.017
so if you're serious about the Copperheads,

10:41.018 --> 10:42.157
you need to throw your hat in the ring.

10:42.158 --> 10:43.642
Like I said, well, you know, Sutton's

10:43.643 --> 10:45.314
pretty busy with school right now and...

10:45.347 --> 10:46.238
How about this week?

10:46.489 --> 10:47.632
Strike while the iron's hot.

10:47.666 --> 10:48.723
I like that.
Honey, you don't have

10:48.790 --> 10:50.340
to feel pressured into this.

10:50.395 --> 10:51.598
No, it's fine. I want to.

10:51.600 --> 10:53.512
It makes break from the dull routine.

10:53.545 --> 10:54.714
Well, then, I'll set it up.

11:03.399 --> 11:05.392
Are you guys sure this is a good idea?

11:05.394 --> 11:07.477
No, I-I don't know.

11:07.511 --> 11:09.299
I mean, it's better than
walking around school

11:09.333 --> 11:11.443
in terror, waiting for some
lunatic to come after me.

11:11.477 --> 11:13.407
But at least here, I can protect you.

11:13.447 --> 11:16.404
Since when was Sutton
so hell-bent on going to

11:16.457 --> 11:18.395
Texas Sutter North, anyway?

11:18.453 --> 11:20.367
Or college, for that matter?

11:20.408 --> 11:22.328
I think that was more of her dad's dream.

11:22.362 --> 11:24.562
I mean, she was into the idea
of living the sorority life.

11:24.596 --> 11:27.221
I guess if you're into lying
games, there's no better venue.

11:27.261 --> 11:31.442
Can you imagine four free years?

11:31.476 --> 11:33.348
Just to play tennis?

11:33.382 --> 11:35.386
God, I would kill

11:35.419 --> 11:37.412
for that.
You know what?

11:37.470 --> 11:39.302
This could be perfect.

11:39.337 --> 11:41.367
I mean, Sutton hated it when you
hijacked her social life, right?

11:41.401 --> 11:43.234
So if you were to use her name

11:43.285 --> 11:45.516
to get into college, she'd go ape.
It's a good call.

11:45.518 --> 11:47.559
I'm not trying to use her name.

11:47.612 --> 11:49.989
Yeah, we know that, but she doesn't.

11:50.190 --> 11:52.483
And the second she finds out
about it, that's it.

11:53.288 --> 11:53.937
Game over.

11:53.999 --> 11:55.988
You win. She'll
come out in the open,

11:55.989 --> 11:58.316
want her life back, and confess
to this whole lying game.

11:59.714 --> 12:01.027
- Gotta go.
- All right.

12:04.593 --> 12:06.815
You've got a death grip
on that club. Relax.

12:06.835 --> 12:08.474
- Why are you so tense?
- 'Cause you're watching me.

12:08.741 --> 12:10.372
See, when nobody's
watching me, I'm perfect.

12:10.577 --> 12:11.896
Just trying to keep you honest.

12:12.013 --> 12:13.824
There are my boys!

12:14.739 --> 12:15.276
Hey.

12:15.809 --> 12:17.859
Oh, by the way, I thought
you might like to see...

12:18.755 --> 12:19.936
You found it!

12:19.980 --> 12:21.198
Actually, my dad did.

12:21.244 --> 12:22.519
So you can thank him.

12:23.472 --> 12:24.770
And breathe easy again.

12:25.043 --> 12:26.963
Hope I didn't make too
big of a deal out of it.

12:27.342 --> 12:29.836
It's just that... it had
a real personal connection.

12:30.620 --> 12:31.999
My mom was wearing it
the day that she died.

12:33.332 --> 12:34.678
Yeah, Laurel was telling me.

12:35.598 --> 12:36.908
Car accident, right?

12:41.813 --> 12:42.881
That's right.

12:55.196 --> 12:57.790
I feel terrible. I feel like
I'm committing my sister.

12:57.607 --> 12:58.811
Aren't you?

12:58.857 --> 12:59.982
Don't be glib.

13:00.019 --> 13:02.569
I need you to give me a euphemism.

13:02.612 --> 13:04.731
You know? You used to be
good at that, at least

13:04.776 --> 13:06.993
that's what I remember.
You're getting her the help she needs.

13:06.995 --> 13:09.003
Was that so hard?

13:09.029 --> 13:10.884
Look, it's her multiple DUIs

13:10.886 --> 13:12.775
that are going to keep her
in this facility until

13:12.822 --> 13:14.897
she accepts that help, so don't feel bad.

13:14.899 --> 13:17.703
Well, we need to discuss Char. Char?

13:17.737 --> 13:20.787
She'll probably stay with her father.

13:20.838 --> 13:22.793
Which is a shame,
'cause they're not that close.

13:22.860 --> 13:24.851
He's married to his job.
I know she'd much stay here.

13:25.035 --> 13:27.759
Yeah. I'd much rather
she stay here with me.

13:27.790 --> 13:29.957
At the house.
Just until Phyllis

13:30.018 --> 13:32.546
gets back on her feet.
Well, the courts are always

13:32.580 --> 13:34.611
more sympathetic to a blood relative.

13:34.629 --> 13:36.993
The courts...
I'm just saying, if it came to that.

13:37.119 --> 13:39.921
So where does that leave us?
I don't know, Alec.

13:39.939 --> 13:42.916
I guess you're right. I guess...
the best option for her

13:42.931 --> 13:45.580
is to just stay with her father for now.

13:49.772 --> 13:52.928
I can see what you're doing here.

13:52.949 --> 13:56.809
Convince Dad that you're all
pumped about TSNU, and he'll

13:56.870 --> 13:59.840
ease up on the hard-ass
parenting regime, am I right?

13:59.907 --> 14:02.750
No. That's not what
I'm doing at all.

14:02.784 --> 14:05.644
I just want to...
get a feel for the school.

14:05.646 --> 14:07.647
Oh, please!

14:07.669 --> 14:10.632
What happened to, "I'm only
applying to California schools"?

14:10.666 --> 14:13.857
I mean, that's all we heard last summer.
I could change my mind.

14:15.893 --> 14:17.840
Well, I gotta hand it to you, you're good.

14:18.691 --> 14:19.734
They totally bought it.

14:19.782 --> 14:21.841
Dad's already polishing his cowboy boots.

14:21.906 --> 14:25.405
Why is it so hard to believe
that I want to visit a college

14:25.406 --> 14:26.949
with no ulterior motive?

14:27.416 --> 14:29.114
Uh, maybe because I know you.

14:29.352 --> 14:31.732
Just... be careful, because
you're playing with fire.

14:31.777 --> 14:33.645
You know how much Dad loves that school.

14:33.646 --> 14:35.385
If he finds out that this is all an act...

14:36.033 --> 14:37.952
it'll be Nana's funeral all over again.

14:42.449 --> 14:44.110
So now you're not going to college?

14:44.662 --> 14:45.814
You know, people are
going to start thinking

14:45.815 --> 14:46.730
you're indecisive.

14:47.034 --> 14:50.203
I'm sorry, but when Laurel starts thinking

14:50.204 --> 14:52.642
that I'm playing Ted and Kristin,

14:52.643 --> 14:53.697
it's gone too far.

14:54.344 --> 14:56.683
If this is a lying game,
I just want it to end.

14:58.065 --> 14:59.392
I'm going to the police.

15:00.151 --> 15:02.420
If that's what you want, I'm with you.

15:02.677 --> 15:04.691
Dan is supposed to be off tonight.

15:05.474 --> 15:06.290
He should be at home.

15:06.472 --> 15:07.189
Okay.

15:22.023 --> 15:22.946
What's he doing here?

15:23.681 --> 15:24.759
Kill the engine.

15:44.060 --> 15:45.756
Something's not right here.

15:47.261 --> 15:48.972
You still want to go to the cops?

15:52.366 --> 15:53.971
So, what, you guys weren't
even going to tell me

15:53.972 --> 15:55.620
- you were going to the cops?
- Dude.

15:56.116 --> 15:57.485
This isn't really about you.

15:58.153 --> 16:00.926
Uh... when the police learn
that I knew Sutton was missing

16:00.927 --> 16:03.621
and hadn't come forward?
Yeah. It'll be about me, too.

16:03.644 --> 16:05.946
We just got a really weird vibe
out at the trailer.

16:05.984 --> 16:07.696
Can you think of any reason

16:07.730 --> 16:09.600
why your dad would be arguing with Dan?

16:09.614 --> 16:11.574
DAs work with cops every day.

16:11.608 --> 16:13.740
Arguing just goes with the territory.

16:13.774 --> 16:16.660
No, this didn't feel like
regular work stuff, man.

16:16.703 --> 16:17.992
It seemed personal.

16:18.045 --> 16:19.970
And I think I heard Derek's name.

16:20.001 --> 16:22.574
I wasn't there, so I can't
really play Hardy Boys with you.

16:22.608 --> 16:23.827
Obviously, there's no one
we can trust here,

16:23.884 --> 16:25.587
so what am I supposed to do?

16:25.621 --> 16:26.910
Just wait until the next note shows up? No.

16:26.944 --> 16:29.611
Go to the college, it'll buy us some time.

16:29.659 --> 16:32.786
I still say Sutton could
ambush you while you're there.

16:32.808 --> 16:35.551
She could just be waiting
till the last possible minute

16:35.585 --> 16:36.757
to blow you out of the water.

16:36.791 --> 16:38.809
This is you selling me on the plan?

16:38.848 --> 16:40.016
You'll do great.

16:40.061 --> 16:42.801
Fine. I will go.

16:42.818 --> 16:45.501
But if Sutton doesn't show
herself by the time I get back,

16:45.535 --> 16:47.030
we are ending this.

16:47.063 --> 16:49.069
All right.

16:57.942 --> 16:59.810
Well, well.

16:59.829 --> 17:02.704
Look at my tax dollars at work.

17:02.748 --> 17:04.984
What's up?
Pull up a chair.

17:04.999 --> 17:06.871
Join me.

17:06.920 --> 17:10.923
Unless you, uh... got like a
book report due or something.

17:10.961 --> 17:14.844
Suppose I could spare a few minutes.

17:17.767 --> 17:18.828
Ah.

17:18.846 --> 17:22.636
Thanks, but, um...
I'll pass.

17:22.670 --> 17:24.636
What's going on with you and Sutton?

17:24.670 --> 17:26.635
She's away looking at colleges.

17:26.669 --> 17:27.770
Let me ask you something.

17:27.808 --> 17:30.016
She helping you with your college list?

17:30.026 --> 17:33.728
You know, getting you to... hone
it down to your top five or six?

17:33.780 --> 17:35.811
Uh-oh.

17:35.845 --> 17:37.950
You know, I was really
thinking that could be a cool

17:37.983 --> 17:40.569
brother thing, for you and I to do.

17:40.625 --> 17:42.018
We could draw on your vast

17:42.038 --> 17:43.958
college experience.

17:43.996 --> 17:46.633
Touché, kid, touché.
I like that.

17:48.999 --> 17:50.665
So, uh...

17:50.699 --> 17:52.001
I was coming home after work last night,

17:52.035 --> 17:53.717
I thought I saw Alec's car out here.

17:53.751 --> 17:56.873
That so? Yeah, it seemed like you guys

17:56.894 --> 17:57.976
were getting into it about something.

17:58.008 --> 17:59.923
You mind if I ask what?

17:59.971 --> 18:03.550
Oh, the no-huddle offense.

18:03.566 --> 18:05.601
I think it really wears out
the D, you know?

18:05.648 --> 18:08.930
But Alec thinks it leads to
sloppy play and turnovers.

18:10.570 --> 18:12.772
We just...
agree to disagree.

18:14.478 --> 18:15.725
You always do this.

18:15.738 --> 18:17.776
You act like you're here for me,

18:17.825 --> 18:19.827
and the second I bring up
anything about Alec,

18:19.866 --> 18:22.783
you just shut down.
You a shrink, now?

18:22.841 --> 18:25.563
Hey, there's something you could
study in school, psychology.

18:25.590 --> 18:27.613
Yeah.
Just forget it, man.

18:27.671 --> 18:29.548
All right, fine, Ethan.
You really want to know?

18:29.582 --> 18:30.667
Yes, I really want to know.

18:30.711 --> 18:33.569
Sit down.

18:33.594 --> 18:37.635
A few years back,
when I had that summer job

18:37.637 --> 18:38.919
working as a caddy at the club,

18:38.939 --> 18:40.742
one of the rich girls,

18:40.770 --> 18:42.970
Paige Billings, mm.

18:43.022 --> 18:46.936
The Third. As she
liked to remind people.

18:47.993 --> 18:50.419
She invited me to a party with
her friends up on that hill,

18:50.420 --> 18:51.426
near the seventh green.

18:51.616 --> 18:53.796
She was hot, so I was like,
hell, yeah, I'm coming.

18:55.156 --> 18:56.123
We got hammered.

18:58.277 --> 18:59.505
And unbeknownst to me,

19:00.306 --> 19:03.172
little miss Paige had been
popping prescription drugs, too.

19:05.299 --> 19:06.076
She OD'd.

19:07.326 --> 19:07.987
Damn.

19:08.615 --> 19:10.547
I was totally innocent,
but when something...

19:10.800 --> 19:13.469
bad happens between a rich kid
and someone like you and me,

19:15.154 --> 19:17.620
you bet your dream catcher, kid,
you're the one getting popped.

19:19.837 --> 19:21.761
I was looking at 25 to 40 years.

19:22.005 --> 19:23.052
For dealing.

19:24.823 --> 19:26.144
Alec made it go away.

19:27.880 --> 19:28.925
So do I owe the guy?

19:29.665 --> 19:31.083
Yeah, dude, I owe him my life.

19:34.708 --> 19:35.427
So...

19:36.015 --> 19:38.089
how do you know when
you've paid off the debt?

19:44.305 --> 19:46.321
And there I was, thinking
you coming over here,

19:46.322 --> 19:49.007
bringing us lunch, might
have a hidden agenda.

19:49.028 --> 19:50.914
Well, it's just that
most people in your position

19:50.915 --> 19:52.818
wouldn't really bother
to help a guy like Derek.

19:53.781 --> 19:55.723
And you just seem to go out of your way to.

19:55.875 --> 19:57.525
So, I've always wondered why.

19:58.842 --> 20:01.291
Why wouldn't you think I was
just being a good person?

20:02.036 --> 20:03.980
You know, treating my fellow man
with the kindness

20:03.981 --> 20:04.932
I expect to be treated with?

20:05.507 --> 20:06.343
Not for a sec.

20:08.236 --> 20:10.864
My man! That's my boy.

20:11.179 --> 20:12.437
Well, T, I guess I just have

20:12.438 --> 20:14.957
a soft spot...
for the underdog.

20:15.098 --> 20:16.670
That, I might believe.

20:17.535 --> 20:18.368
And, plus...

20:19.127 --> 20:21.098
you never know when you
could use another friend.

20:22.558 --> 20:23.100
Hmm?

20:27.822 --> 20:30.190
Okay, now Zeta Kappa Gamma
down to the left.

20:30.191 --> 20:31.664
And the big fraternities

20:32.005 --> 20:33.276
right at the end of this row.

20:33.925 --> 20:35.956
Can we check out Chandler?

20:36.974 --> 20:38.593
The lib... you want
to see the library?

20:38.655 --> 20:39.479
Yeah.

20:39.967 --> 20:42.128
It's like the fifth largest in the country.

20:42.839 --> 20:45.163
Well, we'll go see for ourselves.

20:45.164 --> 20:45.864
Okay.

20:47.313 --> 20:48.886
You love this place.

20:48.887 --> 20:50.288
Are you kidding?
It's Paradise!

20:50.289 --> 20:51.904
I mean... and look at
all these knuckleheads.

20:51.905 --> 20:53.364
None of them know how good they have it.

20:53.916 --> 20:54.925
It's, honest to God...

20:55.214 --> 20:57.528
and nothing compares to
the feeling of having kids...

20:57.562 --> 21:01.188
but this may have been
the best four years of my life.

21:03.192 --> 21:07.328
It's really the only time you
were ever away from Alec, right?

21:07.365 --> 21:09.112
What are you talking about?

21:09.166 --> 21:12.236
Nothing, it just... struck me.

21:12.255 --> 21:14.119
Alec's been a loyal supporter

21:14.171 --> 21:15.943
of this family for a long time, Sutton.

21:15.944 --> 21:16.862
I know.

21:17.414 --> 21:19.461
I know. Sometimes...

21:20.340 --> 21:22.173
he scares me.

21:23.922 --> 21:25.129
What are you talking about?

21:25.130 --> 21:26.456
He's your godfather!

21:26.878 --> 21:27.851
For heaven's...

21:28.221 --> 21:30.080
Did someone say something to you?

21:30.113 --> 21:31.354
No.

21:31.390 --> 21:33.193
No, it's stupid.
Forget I even mentioned it.

21:33.219 --> 21:35.107
I can't imagine where I would be

21:35.146 --> 21:37.273
without some of the things he's
done for me. For our family.

21:37.309 --> 21:39.540
Don't ever forget that.

21:39.571 --> 21:42.262
Come on.
Let's go see the library.

21:44.994 --> 21:46.403
It's like this wall went up

21:46.437 --> 21:48.449
the second I mentioned his name.

21:48.467 --> 21:51.201
The same thing happened when
I brought it up with Dan.

21:51.242 --> 21:53.288
It's like, um...

21:53.330 --> 21:55.207
it's like he's got this hold over people.

21:55.255 --> 21:57.299
It's like everybody is afraid of him.

21:57.339 --> 21:59.438
And no sign of Sutton, obviously?

21:59.472 --> 22:02.464
Mmm-mm.
Isn't this weird,

22:02.504 --> 22:06.487
me video-chatting with you
a thousand miles away?

22:06.502 --> 22:08.398
a habit of it, okay?
Yeah, let's not make it

22:08.434 --> 22:10.057
I don't intend to.

22:10.103 --> 22:13.436
I couldn't even imagine You know, last year

22:13.470 --> 22:16.435
going to college, and I don't know,

22:16.469 --> 22:18.129
now that I'm here, maybe, finally

22:18.155 --> 22:19.318
when everything comes out, Ted will accept

22:19.356 --> 22:21.239
me into the family and I could

22:21.268 --> 22:23.989
get in on my own merit, my own name.

22:24.163 --> 22:26.908
I know, I know, it's a stupid fantasy.

22:26.909 --> 22:28.185
You're gonna go to college, Emma.

22:28.614 --> 22:31.296
You're gonna go someplace great, I know it.

22:31.438 --> 22:33.134
This is so awesome.

22:33.168 --> 22:35.449
Look, I wish, oh, you have
to see this campus.

22:35.483 --> 22:38.500
It, like, takes your breath away.

22:38.519 --> 22:39.417
And the history

22:39.452 --> 22:43.092
Can I tell you something?
and the freedom.

22:43.143 --> 22:46.263
I couldn't imagine being here without you.

22:46.312 --> 22:48.294
Well, then we got a problem, don't we?

22:48.328 --> 22:51.476
Because I don't think our boy's GPA is

22:51.510 --> 22:53.513
getting him to Austin anytime soon.

22:53.561 --> 22:55.756
- Hey, Sutton.
- Hi.

22:55.988 --> 22:57.511
Shouldn't you be resting
up for your big day?

22:57.740 --> 22:59.086
'Cause I don't want my little bro here

22:59.087 --> 23:00.763
getting blamed if you blow your interview

23:00.764 --> 23:02.314
'cause you been up all
night yammering with him.

23:02.749 --> 23:04.129
All right, come on, man, back off.

23:04.130 --> 23:04.814
What are you doing?

23:04.815 --> 23:05.732
Don't you see, kid?

23:06.433 --> 23:07.703
This girl's not like you and me.

23:07.704 --> 23:09.607
She's going places.
College-bound!

23:09.751 --> 23:10.825
Ain't that right, Sutton?

23:10.844 --> 23:12.473
I'm gonna go. Bye, Ethan.

23:12.508 --> 23:13.646
Wait. Just wait.

23:14.886 --> 23:15.579
Get off me.

23:18.377 --> 23:20.420
Don't ever compare us, okay?

23:20.620 --> 23:21.803
I still have some hope.

23:22.077 --> 23:24.583
Something you gave up
when you became Alec's bitch.

23:31.826 --> 23:34.675
Sutton?

23:46.930 --> 23:50.521
Sutton? Are you in there?
Sutton?

23:50.572 --> 23:53.007
Sutton, come back.

23:53.026 --> 23:55.696
Come on, Sutton, this is a big day.

23:58.695 --> 23:59.810
Sutton?

23:59.844 --> 24:01.856
Sutton?

24:01.876 --> 24:02.860
Sutton, honey?

24:02.882 --> 24:04.641
You must have overslept your alarm.

24:04.675 --> 24:06.753
Come on. Big day.

24:18.457 --> 24:19.690
Nice dig, Grace.

24:19.730 --> 24:21.294
Katie, keep that racquet head up.

24:22.653 --> 24:24.577
So, Sutton, you like what you see?

24:24.904 --> 24:27.508
Yeah, they're all so amazing.

24:27.718 --> 24:28.787
More important, they're a team.

24:28.906 --> 24:30.981
College tennis means a lot
of six-hour van rides.

24:31.000 --> 24:32.876
Chemistry's the X factor.
If you want to be

24:32.915 --> 24:35.950
a small part in something big,
we'd love to have you.

24:35.984 --> 24:38.787
If you want to be a big part
in something small,

24:38.821 --> 24:40.619
this is the wrong fit.

24:40.653 --> 24:41.835
I get what you're saying.

24:41.869 --> 24:43.987
Do you?
Mm-hmm.

24:44.006 --> 24:45.822
Look, here's the deal:

24:45.844 --> 24:50.014
At junior tournaments,
coaches talk, you hear things.

24:50.057 --> 24:52.677
I understand in the past,
Sutton Mercer's had

24:52.716 --> 24:57.687
a bit of a mean girl rep.

24:57.721 --> 25:00.040
That's... so over.

25:00.072 --> 25:02.976
I'm a totally different person now.

25:03.010 --> 25:06.489
Hey, it's music to my ears.

25:07.726 --> 25:08.982
Katie!

25:11.800 --> 25:13.466
Level with me, Randy.

25:13.486 --> 25:15.567
Do you think she can really
compete at this level?

25:16.079 --> 25:19.790
Yeah. There's no doubt
she has the skill.

25:19.790 --> 25:21.897
But is her heart in it?

25:21.948 --> 25:23.921
Well, you saw her.
She was the one driving this visit.

25:24.353 --> 25:26.053
Yeah, we saw that.

25:26.104 --> 25:28.121
Bu I also know that we sent
her a recruiting package

25:28.147 --> 25:30.190
along with 19 other top prospects.

25:30.192 --> 25:34.114
We're not allowed to follow up.
They have to contact us.

25:34.146 --> 25:37.024
Now, you want to take a guess
out of that group of girls

25:37.040 --> 25:40.211
of how many of 'em didn't
bother calling us back?

25:52.697 --> 25:54.704
Kid has one good game,

25:54.736 --> 25:58.372
and then Coach thinks he's Phil Mickelson.

25:58.404 --> 26:00.741
Hey, mister. Hey, Phil.

26:00.790 --> 26:03.634
Um, what happened to our
latte date during free block?

26:04.379 --> 26:07.016
Right. Uh,
I must have overslept.

26:08.990 --> 26:09.760
Okay.

26:10.321 --> 26:12.054
Well, I can heat it up for you if you want.

26:12.055 --> 26:13.786
No, that's okay. We're in the
middle of something, so...

26:13.787 --> 26:15.483
Oh, sorry, I didn't mean to...

26:15.484 --> 26:17.295
No, it's cool.
Catch you later?

26:17.483 --> 26:18.943
Yeah, see you at practice.

26:19.152 --> 26:21.069
Hey, and maybe we could hit
some chip shots after,

26:21.427 --> 26:23.142
'cause you know, my short
game is falling apart.

26:24.767 --> 26:26.953
Is everything okay here...
with us?

26:27.863 --> 26:31.006
Sure. I was just trying to make
a plan with a teammate.

26:31.208 --> 26:32.802
Didn't realize that was a problem.

26:34.357 --> 26:35.668
No, it's not.

26:37.269 --> 26:38.534
Justin, why are you talking like this?

26:39.937 --> 26:42.607
Like what? God, I feel like

26:42.608 --> 26:44.348
everything I do is wrong somehow.

26:45.298 --> 26:46.854
It seems like I can't win here.

26:46.855 --> 26:49.307
Win? You seem angry.

26:49.792 --> 26:51.762
Oh, so now I'm angry?

26:52.390 --> 26:54.765
Okay. Well, since apparently
you can read my mind,

26:54.945 --> 26:56.834
why don't you tell me what
else I'm feeling right now?

26:59.296 --> 27:00.983
Justin, do you not want
to be going out with me?

27:02.099 --> 27:05.293
I don't know. I mean, obviously,
things aren't going great,

27:05.294 --> 27:08.780
and maybe we need time apart.

27:12.830 --> 27:14.035
You're breaking up with me?

27:16.309 --> 27:17.064
I don't know.

27:18.234 --> 27:19.188
May-Maybe.

27:22.058 --> 27:23.132
Yeah, I guess so.

27:24.635 --> 27:25.394
I'm sorry.

27:34.116 --> 27:35.857
You know this is super casual, right?

27:35.891 --> 27:37.993
An interview's an interview.

27:38.026 --> 27:39.726
Yeah, but you're... you're
a junior, honey, okay?

27:39.746 --> 27:41.912
This is an unofficial visit.

27:41.946 --> 27:43.666
There's zero pressure.

27:43.703 --> 27:45.730
All it is is just a chance

27:45.756 --> 27:47.867
for you to be yourself.

27:47.901 --> 27:50.868
Yeah, but I just, I don't want
to let everyone down.

27:50.902 --> 27:52.095
Let you down.

27:52.123 --> 27:53.846
Look, honey, I know

27:53.878 --> 27:55.708
these past few months have been tough,

27:55.742 --> 27:56.935
but I'm not thinking about that now.

27:56.958 --> 27:59.968
I'm remembering the last 17 years.

28:00.013 --> 28:03.691
Hey... I want you to know.

28:03.719 --> 28:05.701
what a joy it has been to raise you

28:05.863 --> 28:07.091
and to see you grow into this

28:07.103 --> 28:09.189
beautiful, young, amazing woman.

28:09.581 --> 28:11.498
Honey, I wouldn't trade a minute of it.

28:12.983 --> 28:14.895
Thanks.

28:17.908 --> 28:19.066
Oh, Mom said she'd call.

28:19.100 --> 28:20.703
How about that?

28:20.743 --> 28:21.991
Perfect timing, honey.

28:22.035 --> 28:23.993
I thought I told you never
to call me that, Ted.

28:24.042 --> 28:25.047
Oh, Alec.

28:26.132 --> 28:28.106
Okay.

28:28.132 --> 28:30.646
I was just calling to check on
our girl, see how she's doing.

28:30.842 --> 28:32.000
Yeah, everything's good.

28:32.045 --> 28:33.950
We're just about to head
into the admissions.

28:33.969 --> 28:36.951
She's actually been asking some
odd questions about you, though.

28:36.972 --> 28:38.509
Oh, yeah? Like what?

28:38.726 --> 28:40.850
Just like why you're so intense.

28:40.901 --> 28:43.920
You want to remind her
what might happen to my friends

28:43.922 --> 28:47.799
if I were to, say, go all soft
and play the clown?

28:47.821 --> 28:49.146
Yeah, no, I understand all that.

28:49.318 --> 28:51.036
I'm just saying,
she's under a lot of pressure.

28:51.038 --> 28:53.752
So, next time you see her,
just take it down a notch.

28:53.786 --> 28:55.931
Okay, Ted.

28:56.042 --> 28:57.702
Thanks for the tip.

28:57.745 --> 28:59.689
I got to take this.

29:00.987 --> 29:01.527
Hello?

29:03.127 --> 29:04.464
Hey, sorry to bother you at home,

29:04.465 --> 29:06.931
but the other night, at the trailer,

29:07.389 --> 29:08.601
we had company.

29:10.090 --> 29:12.005
It doesn't make any sense.

29:14.776 --> 29:18.952
He was always so awesome and into me,

29:18.991 --> 29:20.999
and now, suddenly, it's over?

29:23.191 --> 29:23.925
Why?

29:25.011 --> 29:27.251
Oh, honey, I'm just so sorry.

29:28.504 --> 29:30.324
I mean, you guys are still so young.

29:30.325 --> 29:33.702
Maybe... maybe he just thought
you were moving too fast.

29:34.744 --> 29:36.546
But he didn't even explain why.

29:37.089 --> 29:39.190
It was just like, "See ya."

29:41.987 --> 29:44.320
I wish Sutton were here to talk to.

29:47.189 --> 29:48.971
It's just not fair.

29:50.151 --> 29:51.714
Honey, I'm so sorry.

29:57.136 --> 30:00.690
I like the upward trend I see
in your grades this semester.

30:00.724 --> 30:03.156
I have awesome teachers.

30:03.170 --> 30:04.935
Because I'll be frank,

30:04.995 --> 30:07.738
I know that you're an athlete and a legacy.

30:07.929 --> 30:10.859
But up until now, you were a long shot.

30:10.893 --> 30:13.114
But I'm glad to see that
you're turning things around

30:13.116 --> 30:15.101
and taking ownership of your future.

30:15.752 --> 30:17.314
I really have tried.

30:17.718 --> 30:19.043
So, tell me, what changed?

30:19.725 --> 30:20.953
I see the numbers,

30:20.954 --> 30:23.061
but I want to meet the
person behind the numbers.

30:23.563 --> 30:24.991
So, who is Sutton Mercer,

30:25.366 --> 30:27.029
and how did she get to where she is today?

30:27.823 --> 30:32.473
W-Well, I guess...
for a long time,

30:32.474 --> 30:35.925
I was just... coasting...
through life,

30:36.471 --> 30:39.696
taking everything for granted,

30:39.697 --> 30:41.854
including the people around me.

30:42.051 --> 30:45.312
And I never really
thought about the future,

30:45.313 --> 30:47.915
or even believed that I had one.

30:48.583 --> 30:52.299
At least not one worth
dreaming about, anyway.

30:52.670 --> 30:53.894
And then one day,

30:55.013 --> 30:57.089
I don't know, things just changed.

30:57.151 --> 30:59.687
It's like I got a second chance in life,

30:59.966 --> 31:04.055
and, for the first time ever, I saw hope.

31:04.995 --> 31:08.474
And suddenly I realized
I am surrounded by these amazing

31:08.475 --> 31:11.069
and wonderful people who I love

31:11.070 --> 31:14.155
and who I felt love me,
and it was almost perfect.

31:14.156 --> 31:15.235
And I...

31:15.899 --> 31:18.679
I just feel like I'm living this dream,

31:18.727 --> 31:21.805
and, and I...
would do anything...

31:21.990 --> 31:25.895
I mean, anything...

31:25.934 --> 31:30.821
to have this dream just for one more day.

31:39.180 --> 31:41.379
The travelers return.

31:41.398 --> 31:43.078
So?

31:43.102 --> 31:45.381
Did you love it? Did she have a choice?

31:45.411 --> 31:47.365
It was amazing.

31:47.399 --> 31:50.039
Face it, honey, there's two
kinds of people in this world,

31:50.073 --> 31:53.328
Copperheads and those who wish they were.

31:53.359 --> 31:54.448
Guys...

31:54.510 --> 31:56.278
Don't we have another daughter
around here somewhere?

31:56.334 --> 31:59.203
Actually, she's...
she's really upset.

31:59.237 --> 32:01.083
Justin broke up with her.

32:01.116 --> 32:02.297
She's been waiting for you.

32:02.362 --> 32:05.129
Oh, poor Laurel. Mm.

32:05.171 --> 32:07.005
That little bastard.

32:07.038 --> 32:08.022
Ted!

32:08.041 --> 32:10.080
Isn't this what we were hoping for?

32:10.098 --> 32:13.264
No, I don't want to see Laurel get hurt.

32:13.313 --> 32:15.108
Did he give a reason?

32:15.133 --> 32:16.267
Well, that's why she's upset.

32:16.312 --> 32:18.063
It was very odd,

32:18.097 --> 32:21.150
like there was something
he wasn't telling her.

32:21.191 --> 32:24.121
Mm-hmm.

32:24.155 --> 32:27.109
And that's the weirdest part.

32:27.155 --> 32:31.334
I swear, I have no clue why.

32:31.373 --> 32:34.281
You deserve an explanation,

32:34.283 --> 32:36.416
so you can make sense of it and...

32:36.418 --> 32:38.232
Please don't say "move on."

32:38.355 --> 32:40.299
Sorry.

32:40.333 --> 32:42.255
You want to know the craziest thing?

32:42.289 --> 32:44.415
And this might sound loony,
but I get the sense that

32:44.449 --> 32:46.278
it has something to do with Dad.

32:46.311 --> 32:47.346
Seriously?

32:47.394 --> 32:48.906
They've been acting...

32:48.965 --> 32:50.330
completely weird around each other,

32:50.390 --> 32:54.295
and Justin's been saying
all these random things like,

32:54.297 --> 32:57.263
Dad's not this great guy
everyone thinks he is.

32:57.297 --> 32:59.326
Okay, yeah, you need

32:59.345 --> 33:01.149
to talk to him when you feel stronger.

33:01.188 --> 33:02.932
But not at school.

33:03.045 --> 33:04.255
It's too public...
he might feel cornered.

33:04.289 --> 33:07.115
Just drop by his place
and hear his side of things.

33:07.149 --> 33:09.165
He owes you that much.

33:09.194 --> 33:11.156
You're the best.

33:11.205 --> 33:13.186
Yeah? Feel better?

33:13.303 --> 33:16.007
God, no. I want to die.

33:16.032 --> 33:19.035
But, you know, thanks
for being here for me.

33:19.114 --> 33:20.938
Of course.

33:20.940 --> 33:23.214
All right, I'll see you later.

33:33.102 --> 33:34.374
Still no answer.
I told you.

33:34.431 --> 33:36.337
Thayer's gone AWOL.

33:36.355 --> 33:39.190
He said something vague about one
more thing he needed to check.

33:39.232 --> 33:42.196
His dad was a dead end.
Okay, well, we need to find him,

33:42.226 --> 33:44.181
because I almost threw up
in that interview.

33:44.201 --> 33:47.182
And then I have Ted telling me
how proud he is of me.

33:47.201 --> 33:49.029
I know. It's messed up.

33:49.061 --> 33:51.355
Ethan, that nightmare was so real.

33:51.380 --> 33:53.313
It's so awful.

33:53.347 --> 33:56.986
I mean, if Sutton is gone...

33:56.988 --> 33:59.139
don't you think her family
deserves to know?

34:03.924 --> 34:06.199
We've had some awesome times here.

34:06.209 --> 34:08.291
And we'll have more.

34:08.328 --> 34:12.196
God alone knows when we
shall see each other again.

34:12.223 --> 34:16.041
And we shall leave it
up to him to find out.

34:18.212 --> 34:21.337
Oh, come on, you cannot have forgotten.

34:21.371 --> 34:23.237
<i>Middle school Fiddler.</i>

34:23.268 --> 34:27.097
Oh, yeah. Duh.

34:27.143 --> 34:29.320
I was so psyched to get Hodel's song,

34:29.322 --> 34:31.983
And then the music started
and I totally froze.

34:32.014 --> 34:34.065
You spoke the entire song.

34:34.116 --> 34:35.318
It was hilarious.

34:35.351 --> 34:37.956
Oh, your mother was ready to kill you.

34:38.002 --> 34:40.194
This is so unfair.

34:40.308 --> 34:42.059
This really sucks.

34:42.076 --> 34:43.335
I know.

34:43.362 --> 34:46.917
My aunt tried everything
she could to have me stay,

34:46.960 --> 34:49.351
but in the end it was my dad's decision.

34:49.371 --> 34:51.960
I guess he wants me after all.

34:55.955 --> 34:58.057
I hate to say this, girls.

34:58.091 --> 34:59.399
I guess it's time.

35:08.942 --> 35:10.257
Rebecca.

35:10.270 --> 35:12.217
Hello, Ted.

35:12.333 --> 35:14.275
Rebecca, I'm so glad you called.

35:14.319 --> 35:16.313
Please, come in, come in.
Thank you.

35:20.002 --> 35:21.948
<i>You know Char.</i>

35:21.996 --> 35:23.941
And I could tell that
she didn't want to go.

35:23.955 --> 35:25.938
And I guess he's sort of an awful man.

35:25.954 --> 35:27.937
It's... it's a really
difficult situation.

35:27.965 --> 35:29.378
Part of me just wants

35:29.380 --> 35:32.192
to say, "Stay here at the house
with me," you know,

35:32.226 --> 35:34.959
but you know how Phyllis would react

35:34.993 --> 35:39.186
and I couldn't just
take someone else's child.

35:39.253 --> 35:42.119
I mean, who does that?

35:42.121 --> 35:46.012
Well, for what it's worth, I...

35:46.014 --> 35:47.245
I think you're doing the right thing.

35:47.434 --> 35:48.284
Really?

35:48.436 --> 35:49.081
Mm-hmm.

35:49.829 --> 35:52.560
Whew. Thank you. Thank you.

35:53.071 --> 35:55.113
That really means a lot to me
coming from you.

36:00.018 --> 36:02.926
You don't find this beyond disturbing?

36:02.947 --> 36:04.999
Would you prefer that they were
totally awkward

36:05.042 --> 36:05.982
around one another?

36:06.006 --> 36:07.167
I'd prefer that Rebecca Sewell

36:07.176 --> 36:09.112
wasn't curled up on my couch at home

36:09.146 --> 36:11.009
getting all chummy with my wife.

36:11.032 --> 36:13.272
Let's give her the benefit
of the doubt, what do you say?

36:13.306 --> 36:15.098
She's been really helpful
with this Char business,

36:15.100 --> 36:16.358
and people can change.
You really believe that?

36:18.350 --> 36:21.266
I got to take this.

36:21.293 --> 36:23.973
What?

36:26.334 --> 36:28.393
Hey.

36:31.370 --> 36:35.317
Thought we should talk about
what happened earlier at school.

36:35.351 --> 36:37.368
Justin, come on, that wasn't us.

36:37.417 --> 36:40.112
We never treated each other like that.

36:40.146 --> 36:41.938
Just so you know, I was trying
to let you down easy.

36:42.888 --> 36:44.423
So you've really just wasted your time.

36:46.287 --> 36:47.739
Please, can we not do this here?

36:47.740 --> 36:49.636
I was hoping we could go
to your room and talk.

36:50.419 --> 36:51.437
Trust me, you don't...

36:52.550 --> 36:53.588
want to do that.

36:53.630 --> 36:54.475
"GRILL".

36:56.464 --> 36:57.558
You're with someone?

37:21.851 --> 37:25.626
"STATE OF CALIFORNIA
AUTOPSY REPORT".

37:27.236 --> 37:29.999
When I was walking around the campus,

37:30.031 --> 37:32.345
I actually thought what if..

37:32.875 --> 37:36.841
What if Sutton just never came back.

37:37.021 --> 37:40.210
And I took over her life.

37:41.090 --> 37:41.731
Forever.

37:43.107 --> 37:45.008
And you know, for like a split second,

37:45.009 --> 37:47.768
I thought somehow that that would be okay.

37:50.783 --> 37:53.072
How sick is that?

37:54.189 --> 37:55.871
And, I mean, what happened to us?

37:56.322 --> 37:59.044
It's like our moral compass just snapped.

37:59.863 --> 38:01.213
None of this is your fault.

38:02.868 --> 38:04.166
I really think it is.

38:05.348 --> 38:08.270
Maybe I just got what I wanted all along.

38:15.238 --> 38:16.527
Dude, where have you been?

38:19.546 --> 38:20.709
I think Sutton's dead.

38:21.781 --> 38:23.199
And I'm pretty sure I know who killed her.

38:31.600 --> 38:33.867
Once we finally stopped
suspecting one another,

38:34.161 --> 38:36.658
Who would really want to kill Sutton?

38:36.659 --> 38:38.832
- It'd have to be some kind of psycho.
- Exactly.

38:39.013 --> 38:40.196
But I was bumping on the note.

38:40.197 --> 38:42.301
It was too much
like a lying game, you know,

38:42.302 --> 38:43.319
and then she didn't show up at the college,

38:43.320 --> 38:45.686
so I thought, you know, maybe
someone else did write it,

38:45.909 --> 38:46.735
but who would want Emma

38:46.736 --> 38:47.932
to keep on being Sutton?

38:48.563 --> 38:52.431
Someone who doesn't want the
secret of the twins to be out.

38:52.512 --> 38:54.519
Yeah, and who would go
to such crazy extremes

38:54.520 --> 38:55.390
to protect that secret?

38:55.911 --> 38:58.454
Maybe a birth mother
who never wanted to be found.

38:58.654 --> 38:59.696
Annie Hobbs.

39:00.267 --> 39:01.118
Now, remember what the guy

39:01.119 --> 39:02.742
in the Vegas juvie center told us?

39:03.174 --> 39:05.560
Emma Becker was sent
from some psych ward in L.A.

39:06.092 --> 39:07.492
I totally forgot about that.

39:07.493 --> 39:09.639
And then I remembered the list of addresses

39:09.640 --> 39:11.257
that I gave Sutton for the art gallery.

39:11.534 --> 39:13.469
One of them was this
psychiatric clinic in L.A.

39:14.149 --> 39:14.980
Oh, my God.

39:14.981 --> 39:16.245
Yeah, so I called, pretending to be,

39:16.246 --> 39:17.533
like, some assistant at the gallery,

39:18.189 --> 39:18.932
and guess what...

39:19.642 --> 39:21.485
Annie Hobbs broke out
of the place last week

39:22.458 --> 39:23.044
and just...

39:23.484 --> 39:24.377
vanished.

39:25.810 --> 39:27.185
Seeing Sutton after all these years,

39:27.186 --> 39:28.858
she must have just lost it.

39:30.174 --> 39:31.567
This isn't a lying game.

39:33.085 --> 39:34.646
I'm really sorry I had to tell you this.

39:36.300 --> 39:39.831
You know, ever since
I had that dream, I knew.

39:44.838 --> 39:46.475
I have to go tell her family.

39:55.228 --> 39:55.781
Mom?

39:57.035 --> 39:57.585
Dad?

39:59.320 --> 40:00.313
Anyone home?

40:04.243 --> 40:04.901
Come on.

40:12.961 --> 40:15.243
I can't believe this is happening.

40:16.304 --> 40:17.442
You know, it's funny.

40:19.323 --> 40:22.200
Just standing here,
you can feel her everywhere,

40:23.098 --> 40:24.448
so alive.

40:24.732 --> 40:26.728
I can't even believe

40:26.729 --> 40:28.087
that she could be gone...

40:29.722 --> 40:31.120
forever.

40:38.564 --> 40:40.018
You know, as bad as things ended,

40:41.020 --> 40:42.495
we did have some good times together.

40:43.222 --> 40:44.891
She was unpredictable.

40:45.662 --> 40:48.722
You just held your breath
and went along for the ride.

40:49.306 --> 40:51.180
I think I've been in love
with Sutton Mercer

40:51.181 --> 40:52.053
since the second grade.

40:52.791 --> 40:53.896
I remember, once, she came over

40:53.897 --> 40:55.208
with Mads for a playdate,

40:55.273 --> 40:57.258
and I actually got tongue-tied.

40:58.060 --> 40:59.282
In front of a
seven-year-old.

40:59.842 --> 41:00.969
Even then, she had this

41:00.970 --> 41:02.180
crazy confidence.

41:03.147 --> 41:04.397
You were just drawn to her.

41:31.318 --> 41:32.353
I'll never forget...

41:33.916 --> 41:37.324
the first time I heard her voice.

41:37.496 --> 41:39.074
God, it was like this..

41:39.569 --> 41:41.509
electric charge.

41:41.602 --> 41:42.847
My sister.

41:43.727 --> 41:46.551
It's my sister and my twin.

41:48.596 --> 41:49.927
I feel bad that I...

41:51.513 --> 41:52.122
I didn't know her

41:52.123 --> 41:54.990
as well as you guys did, but if I had,

41:55.081 --> 41:57.394
you can be sure that we
would have been inseparable.

42:00.279 --> 42:01.434
Thank you for sharing

42:02.379 --> 42:04.388
your friends and your family with me.

42:06.919 --> 42:10.594
They've really...
changed my life.

42:18.661 --> 42:20.503
Well, isn't this cozy?

42:23.642 --> 42:25.693
I'm sorry.
Have I come at a bad time?

42:30.172 --> 42:33.565
