32:09.184 --> 32:11.897
Yeah. Yeah, she might.

32:13.395 --> 32:16.847
But you're still gonna pull
on that thread, aren't you?

32:16.946 --> 32:18.907
No matter what I say,

32:19.752 --> 32:22.074
no matter what you unravel?

32:29.118 --> 32:31.147
I believe in her.

32:35.177 --> 32:36.792
That's all I got.

32:40.975 --> 32:42.533
It's all I got.

32:55.924 --> 32:58.758
It's probably gonna be my
ass when they check the logs.

32:58.841 --> 33:01.258
I knew you wouldn't
take "no" for an answer.

33:04.685 --> 33:06.402
"Lionel Polanski." That's the name she used

33:06.437 --> 33:08.153
when she registered the shuttle.

33:08.204 --> 33:10.219
Someone with that name is
registered at the Blue Falcon.

33:10.254 --> 33:11.021
What's that? Where is it?

33:11.056 --> 33:12.720
It's a flophouse core-side.

33:12.806 --> 33:13.891
But it's not a good place.

33:13.926 --> 33:15.759
I'll talk to you later, buddy.

33:16.457 --> 33:17.923

33:31.909 --> 33:33.414

33:37.206 --> 33:38.675
What's their ETA?

33:38.819 --> 33:40.518

33:41.340 --> 33:43.015
Keep me posted.

33:46.250 --> 33:48.351
- Hope it's not a letter to a wife.
- It's not.

33:48.386 --> 33:50.802
It's a real-time tactical record
of the <i>Donnager</i> battle,

33:50.837 --> 33:52.421
right down to the millisecond,

33:52.479 --> 33:54.613
with full sensor logs and analysis.

33:54.648 --> 33:57.199
This must've come directly from the CIC.

33:57.291 --> 34:00.368
They also got hi-res images
of the attacking ships.

34:00.404 --> 34:02.070
Were they able to identify them?

34:02.122 --> 34:03.822
Not from what I can see here.

34:03.874 --> 34:07.943
But they were able to collect
highly detailed drive signatures.

34:08.042 --> 34:12.960
Well, they did fly closer to those
ships than anyone else in the system.

34:13.168 --> 34:15.167
Unfortunately, for them.

34:16.235 --> 34:18.476
You're going to want to
see this for yourself.

34:23.025 --> 34:25.371
So what are you going to do now?

34:27.920 --> 34:30.659
This place used to be
the jewel of the Belt.

34:30.737 --> 34:32.818
I wish I could've seen it in its heyday.

34:32.853 --> 34:34.071
It's not a bad district, though.

34:34.106 --> 34:37.110
I'm tellin' you, if you guys
like okra-infused tank-grown ribs,

34:37.145 --> 34:38.748
there's this place on

Lionel Polanski.

- No.

36:54.077 --> 36:57.168
No, it's a surprise thing. Thank you.

37:15.015 --> 37:18.066
Maybe I should go up on my
own. Not freak the guy out.

37:18.170 --> 37:20.101
Maybe take Amos.
