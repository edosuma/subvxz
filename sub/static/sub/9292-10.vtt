AUDREY:
I'm on the phone with a man
who claims to James Nathanson.

00:16.104 --> 00:17.338
He was Walt Cummings' contact.

00:17.405 --> 00:19.038
He says he has information
about the terrorists,

00:19.104 --> 00:20.538
but he will only talk to you.

00:20.605 --> 00:21.538
JACK:
What do you want with me?

00:21.605 --> 00:22.937
CUMMINGS:
Protection.

00:23.004 --> 00:24.738
The terrorists you're after
are trying to kill me.

00:24.804 --> 00:26.038
What makes you think
I'm not gonna kill you myself?

00:26.104 --> 00:27.438
Because you want to stop

00:27.505 --> 00:30.271
the Sentox gas from being
released on American soil.

00:30.338 --> 00:31.271
<i>So do I.</i>

00:31.338 --> 00:33.171
Nathanson, stay down!

00:33.238 --> 00:35.438
Stay down!

00:38.672 --> 00:42.238
What's on the chip?
Please, what's on the chip!

00:42.305 --> 00:43.772
O'Brian.

00:43.837 --> 00:45.471
I have a thumb drive that's
gonna help us find the Sentox.

00:45.538 --> 00:48.271
CHLOE:
The decryption element
kicked out a company

00:48.338 --> 00:49.871
called Omicron International.

00:49.937 --> 00:51.605
Pull up their
senior executive roster,

00:51.672 --> 00:53.405
See if a man named Christopher
Henderson's on the list.

00:53.471 --> 00:54.738
Okay, here it is.

00:54.804 --> 00:56.371
Senior Vice President
of Research and Development.

00:56.438 --> 00:58.271
Send me the decrypted files
over to my PDA.

00:58.338 --> 01:00.338
That's gonna be a little bit
hard to do right now, Jack.

01:00.405 --> 01:02.238
The two of you are up
to something, and I'm
not gonna stand for it.

01:02.305 --> 01:04.971
This is a deliberate attempt
to circumvent my authority.

01:05.038 --> 01:07.104
Lynn, we're all
on the same side.
If you're father wasn't

01:07.171 --> 01:08.837
the Secretary of
Defense, I'd have you
thrown out of here.

01:08.904 --> 01:11.438
I don't have that problem
with you.

01:11.505 --> 01:13.937
I spent a year securing a weapon

01:14.004 --> 01:16.638
that would bring Moscow
to its knees.

01:16.705 --> 01:18.804
<i>And you waste it.</i>

01:18.871 --> 01:20.672
We were betrayed, Bierko.

01:20.738 --> 01:22.738
Someone must pay.
I agree.

01:25.371 --> 01:28.104
This is President Logan.
What is it you want?

01:28.171 --> 01:29.772
I want the route
of Suvarov's motorcade.

01:29.837 --> 01:32.837
If you refuse to cooperate,

01:32.904 --> 01:35.071
I will have no choice
but to release

01:35.138 --> 01:36.605
all the Sentox nerve gas.

01:36.672 --> 01:38.371
He wants to assassinate Suvarov.

01:38.438 --> 01:39.937
Don't negotiate with them!

01:40.004 --> 01:42.638
Isn't that the point of the
treaty you just signed?

01:42.705 --> 01:44.904
Mr. President, I'm glad
that we have this opportunity

01:44.971 --> 01:46.004
to thank you

01:46.071 --> 01:47.505
and Mrs. Logan

01:47.571 --> 01:48.638
for your hospitality.

01:48.705 --> 01:50.171
The motorcade will take

01:50.238 --> 01:52.104
service roads to the 118...

01:52.171 --> 01:53.505
Mrs. Logan...
Aaron,

01:53.571 --> 01:55.937
I've decided to drive to
the airport with the Suvarovs.

01:56.004 --> 01:57.104
I'll ride up front.

01:57.171 --> 01:58.672
No, that's not necessary.

01:58.738 --> 01:59.837
Yes, it is.

02:21.538 --> 02:23.071
Yes?

02:23.138 --> 02:25.638
Where is the motorcade now?
Just getting on the 118.

02:25.705 --> 02:27.438
How long before they reach
the ambush point?

02:27.505 --> 02:29.104
About 40 minutes.

02:29.171 --> 02:31.738
Good. We'll be waiting.

02:33.705 --> 02:36.038
Get everything ready.

02:44.071 --> 02:47.138
Mr. President,
I asked Secret Service

02:47.204 --> 02:49.038
to sent a threat assessment

02:49.104 --> 02:51.038
for President
Suvarov's route.

02:51.104 --> 02:52.605
The most vulnerable point

02:52.672 --> 02:54.705
is here,
the downtown corridor.

02:54.772 --> 02:57.904
This is the most likely
point of attack.

02:57.971 --> 03:00.104
If an ambush were to occur.

03:00.171 --> 03:02.738
It's going to happen, Mike.

03:02.804 --> 03:05.305
We gave the terrorists
Suvarov's route.

03:08.138 --> 03:11.238
I need to come up
with a public response.

03:11.305 --> 03:12.738
I need to convince
the world that

03:12.804 --> 03:14.672
Suvarov's death
only underscores the importance

03:14.738 --> 03:17.204
of this antiterrorism treaty

03:17.271 --> 03:19.071
that we just signed.

03:19.138 --> 03:23.605
I'll, uh, begin working
on a statement, sir.

03:23.672 --> 03:26.271
Yes?

03:29.305 --> 03:32.438
Thank you. I'll...
let the president know.

03:34.638 --> 03:35.871
What? What is it, Mike?

03:35.937 --> 03:38.405
What's going on?

03:38.471 --> 03:40.305
Who was that?

03:42.672 --> 03:44.804
Agent Pierce. Um,

03:44.871 --> 03:47.638
I don't know how
to tell you this.
Just tell me.

03:47.705 --> 03:51.804
Mrs. Logan is riding
with the Suvarovs.

03:51.871 --> 03:56.904
What are you talking about?
Sir, she got into
that limousine.

03:56.971 --> 03:58.804
Oh, my God.

03:58.871 --> 04:00.772
Didn't-didn't the
Secret Service

04:00.837 --> 04:02.438
try to stop her?!

04:02.505 --> 04:04.171
There was no reason to stop her.

04:04.238 --> 04:06.138
The motorcade is under
Secret Service escort.

04:06.204 --> 04:08.871
As far as they're concerned,
she's not in any danger.

04:08.937 --> 04:10.738
She wants me to call back

04:10.804 --> 04:12.904
the motorcade-- she's trying
to save the Suvarovs.

04:12.971 --> 04:14.438
Should I alert them?

04:14.505 --> 04:16.071
Yes!

04:16.137 --> 04:17.772
No, stop, wait.

04:21.370 --> 04:25.004
If we warn them, the terrorists
are going to set off the gas.

04:27.738 --> 04:29.672
Where are they now?

04:29.738 --> 04:32.438
They're still on the 118.

04:34.937 --> 04:37.004
Get my wife on the phone.

04:48.204 --> 04:51.238
MRS. SUVAROV:
My aunt visited Los Angeles

04:51.305 --> 04:54.505
in the 1950s.

04:54.571 --> 04:57.004
She told me this area
was filled with orange groves,

04:57.071 --> 04:58.538
but I haven't seen any.

04:59.672 --> 05:03.004
I suppose it's all been
built over, no?

05:04.038 --> 05:05.837
Martha?

05:05.904 --> 05:08.505
Yes. I-I...
I was just trying to remember.

05:08.571 --> 05:11.371
Um, I think your aunt's memory
is better than mine.

05:11.438 --> 05:13.171
I visited here when
I was a child,

05:13.238 --> 05:15.071
but I don't recall
the orange groves.

05:16.538 --> 05:18.438
Yeah, this is Pierce.

05:21.738 --> 05:23.837
Mrs. Logan,

05:23.904 --> 05:26.405
it's the president
for you on line one.
Thank you, Aaron.

05:29.305 --> 05:30.871
Hello, Charles.

05:30.937 --> 05:32.204
Listen to me carefully.

05:32.271 --> 05:33.405
I want you...

05:33.471 --> 05:35.405
Yes, I think they had
a wonderful visit.

05:35.471 --> 05:37.937
And they would very much like
for us to come to Moscow.

05:38.004 --> 05:39.937
Wouldn't that be lovely?

05:40.004 --> 05:44.104
I want you to tell the Suvarovs
that I need you back here.

05:44.171 --> 05:47.004
I'm gonna have one of the
follow cars bring you back.

05:47.071 --> 05:50.505
I don't think so, Charles.
Tell them now, while
I'm on the phone.

05:50.571 --> 05:52.672
Martha,

05:52.738 --> 05:56.538
I know that you want me to call
the motorcade back, but...

05:56.605 --> 05:57.837
the terrorists were
very specific:

05:57.904 --> 06:00.571
if-if I don't allow them
to attack the motorcade,

06:00.638 --> 06:01.871
they're gonna release

06:01.937 --> 06:04.904
canisters of nerve gas
in multiple locations.

06:04.971 --> 06:07.804
Well, I... guess we'll just have
to figure something out

06:07.871 --> 06:11.871
before that happens.
We're trying! We're trying,

06:11.937 --> 06:14.238
but we haven't found them yet.

06:14.305 --> 06:15.971
You need to get out of the car.

06:16.038 --> 06:18.104
Okay, I should go now,
but you'll call me
Martha...

06:18.171 --> 06:20.138
if there's any change of plans?
Damn it, Martha!

06:20.204 --> 06:23.004
Okay, bye-bye.
I'll-I'll talk to you soon.

06:25.705 --> 06:28.538
She won't get out
of the limousine.

06:28.605 --> 06:30.371
My God.

06:30.438 --> 06:33.071
We got to do something, Mike; we
got to get her out of the car.

06:33.138 --> 06:35.238
I could have, uh, one
of the trail cars

06:35.305 --> 06:37.937
stop them and force her out,
say that I need her back here.

06:38.004 --> 06:42.138
You could, but... if Martha

06:42.204 --> 06:44.238
is desperate to save
the Suvarovs,

06:44.305 --> 06:47.271
she might feel that
the only remaining option

06:47.338 --> 06:49.672
is to tell them the truth.

06:52.305 --> 06:55.638
And Suvarov will know that
I gave him up for assassination.

07:01.004 --> 07:03.271
Sir,

07:03.338 --> 07:06.672
do you want me to recall
the motorcade or not?

07:21.238 --> 07:23.038
Edgar, meet me
in the server room

07:23.104 --> 07:24.804
in a few minutes.

07:24.871 --> 07:26.405
Am I in trouble?
No, but there's
something

07:26.471 --> 07:27.638
very important
that we need to discuss.

07:27.705 --> 07:30.871
Okay.
And, Edgar,

07:30.937 --> 07:32.638
don't tell anyone
where you're going.

07:32.705 --> 07:35.405
This needs to stay
between us.
Sure.

07:42.705 --> 07:44.471
What did Audrey Raines want?

07:44.538 --> 07:47.171
She was just going over
some DOD protocols.

07:47.238 --> 07:50.405
I thought you were supposed
to be monitoring chatter.

07:50.471 --> 07:52.471
We are.
Why isn't it on
my screen, Carrie?

07:52.538 --> 07:53.705
I didn't think
you wanted us to mirror

07:53.772 --> 07:55.204
everything
to your system.

07:55.271 --> 07:58.371
I thought you wanted
to save time.
I do want to save time.

07:58.438 --> 08:00.371
It saves me time by not having
to clean up more mistakes.

08:00.438 --> 08:02.405
Mirror everything until
we've secured this nerve gas.

08:02.471 --> 08:03.538
Is that clear?

08:03.605 --> 08:05.271
Yes, sir.

08:12.738 --> 08:15.904
The thumb drive data
Jack sent us checks
out as authentic.

08:15.971 --> 08:18.038
It's time-stamped
by DOD and CIA.

08:18.104 --> 08:21.104
So Omicron International
did make Sentox gas
for the military.

08:21.171 --> 08:23.338
Yeah, and some terrorists
found out about it.

08:23.405 --> 08:27.171
Or worse-- they were in contact
with Omicron.

08:27.238 --> 08:29.204
Who is this Henderson?

08:29.271 --> 08:32.672
CHLOE:
Christopher Henderson,
Senior Vice President, R&D.

08:32.738 --> 08:35.171
Jack said he knew him,
but he wouldn't talk about it.

08:35.238 --> 08:36.705
Is he connected with the Sentox?

08:36.772 --> 08:39.804
Doesn't say;
it just said he was a senior VP.
All right.

08:46.104 --> 08:47.705
Yeah?

08:47.772 --> 08:49.605
Jack, we've authenticated
the thumb drive data.

08:49.672 --> 08:52.204
Omicron definitely made the
Sentox for the military.

08:52.271 --> 08:53.705
Okay, I'm almost there--
look, I need you

08:53.772 --> 08:55.238
to work something up
that gets me through

08:55.305 --> 08:56.772
the front door
without them knowing I'm CTU.

08:56.837 --> 08:58.605
Do you think it's necessary
to go in covertly?

08:58.672 --> 09:00.171
Yeah. There's someone
I need to talk to.

09:00.238 --> 09:01.772
I don't want him
to see me coming.

09:01.837 --> 09:02.937
Christopher Henderson?

09:03.004 --> 09:04.004
Yeah.

09:04.071 --> 09:05.071
Who is he?

09:05.138 --> 09:06.605
Someone I used to work for.

09:06.672 --> 09:07.904
Where?

09:07.971 --> 09:09.871
CTU. He was the man
who recruited me.

09:09.937 --> 09:11.104
You've never mentioned him.

09:11.171 --> 09:12.238
I know.

09:12.305 --> 09:13.672
Things ended badly between us.

09:13.738 --> 09:15.937
What happened?

09:16.004 --> 09:18.705
I was part of an investigation
that uncovered evidence

09:18.772 --> 09:20.505
that implicated him in the sale

09:20.571 --> 09:23.937
of classified intelligence
to defense contractors.

09:24.004 --> 09:26.104
We never had enough evidence
to indict him,

09:26.171 --> 09:28.772
but he lost his job,
his command.

09:28.837 --> 09:30.904
Even as he was walking
out the door,

09:30.971 --> 09:32.871
he maintained his innocence.

09:32.937 --> 09:35.738
He never forgave me for being
part of the investigation.

09:35.804 --> 09:37.438
Are you convinced he did it?

09:37.505 --> 09:40.138
I was at the time.

09:40.204 --> 09:41.904
Jack, Chloe can't find
a direct connection

09:41.971 --> 09:43.338
between the Sentox
and Henderson.

09:43.405 --> 09:44.638
Trust me,

09:44.705 --> 09:47.004
if Omicron was making Sentox,
legally or illegally,

09:47.071 --> 09:48.904
Henderson knew about it.

09:48.971 --> 09:50.004
Get back to me as soon

09:50.071 --> 09:51.238
as you got my cover.
All right,

09:51.305 --> 09:53.338
I'm on it.
What are you doing
here, Chloe?

09:53.405 --> 09:54.705
Same thing you're doing here.

09:54.772 --> 09:56.371
Edgar, thank you for coming.

09:56.438 --> 09:58.937
Look, whatever this
is about, I don't
have a lot of time.

09:59.004 --> 10:01.238
We don't have a single active
lead on this nerve gas.

10:01.305 --> 10:02.638
That's not exactly true.

10:02.705 --> 10:04.571
Jack is following a lead
out in the field.

10:04.638 --> 10:06.438
How do <i>you</i> know?
I just spoke with him.

10:06.505 --> 10:09.971
Everyone's looking for him.
Lynn issued an arrest warrant.

10:10.038 --> 10:11.738
That's why we wanted
to talk to you, Edgar.

10:11.804 --> 10:13.638
Lynn is losing it--
first he went after Jack,

10:13.705 --> 10:15.505
and then he took Bill Buchanan
out of play.

10:15.571 --> 10:18.305
Lynn is incapable of leading us
through this crisis.

10:18.371 --> 10:20.837
So you're both working
behind his back?
We're afraid that if

10:20.904 --> 10:23.904
we bring him into this,
he might derail the only
good lead that we have.

10:23.971 --> 10:25.804
We have to help Jack
locate the nerve gas

10:25.871 --> 10:28.538
before it's too late.
What do you want from me?

10:28.605 --> 10:31.071
Cover for Chloe until
Jack reports back.

10:35.538 --> 10:36.705
Please.

10:36.772 --> 10:39.071
Okay.
Thank you.

10:42.772 --> 10:46.405
Okay, fine. Yeah.

10:46.471 --> 10:47.837
That was Secret Service.

10:47.904 --> 10:49.605
As you can see,
the motorcade continues

10:49.672 --> 10:51.772
to make its way to the airport
without incident.

10:51.837 --> 10:53.371
There won't be
any warning, Mike.

10:53.438 --> 10:55.038
When these people
attack,

10:55.104 --> 10:56.937
they will be fast
and they will be merciless.

10:57.004 --> 10:58.471
You can count on that.

10:58.538 --> 10:59.837
I have to talk to this man.

10:59.904 --> 11:02.271
M-Maybe I can convince him
to hold off.

11:02.338 --> 11:03.471
Hold off?

11:03.538 --> 11:04.904
Just until Martha
gets out of the car.

11:04.971 --> 11:06.238
She wasn't supposed to be a part
of this in the first place.

11:06.305 --> 11:07.837
Sir, I don't think that would
change his plan.

11:07.904 --> 11:10.571
He has to know that my wife's
in the car!

11:12.138 --> 11:14.538
I can't lose her, Mike.

11:14.605 --> 11:16.571
The only way
to keep Martha safe

11:16.638 --> 11:18.104
is for me to call Secret Service

11:18.171 --> 11:19.772
and tell them to turn

11:19.837 --> 11:21.004
the motorcade around.

11:21.071 --> 11:22.371
What about...
what about CTU?

11:22.438 --> 11:23.904
Do they have any active leads

11:23.971 --> 11:25.104
on the nerve gas?

11:25.171 --> 11:26.371
As of five minutes ago,
they don't...

11:26.438 --> 11:27.871
nothing that would help
our situation.

11:27.937 --> 11:28.937
What am I missing, Mike?!

11:29.004 --> 11:31.104
There's got to be some way out,

11:31.171 --> 11:32.438
something
that I'm not seeing.

11:32.505 --> 11:34.071
You're not missing anything.

11:34.138 --> 11:36.971
Any action we take
to save Martha

11:37.038 --> 11:38.705
would also save
the Suvarovs,

11:38.772 --> 11:40.371
and if that happens,

11:40.438 --> 11:42.638
the terrorists
will release the gas.

11:42.705 --> 11:44.071
Unfortunately,

11:44.138 --> 11:46.038
it's <i>that</i> simple.

11:50.505 --> 11:53.471
Then there's nothing more
we can do, Mike.

11:53.538 --> 11:55.271
Unless I warn them.

11:57.138 --> 11:59.505
Martha's going to die
with the Suvarovs.

12:06.971 --> 12:10.371
Aaron...
have there been any changes?

12:10.438 --> 12:12.405
Excuse me?

12:12.471 --> 12:14.438
Changes to what,
Mrs. Logan?

12:14.505 --> 12:15.672
I-I was just wondering

12:15.738 --> 12:17.171
if there had been any changes
to our route.

12:17.238 --> 12:18.605
We haven't gotten

12:18.672 --> 12:21.038
any revised
instructions, ma'am.

12:22.904 --> 12:25.871
Thank you.

12:33.738 --> 12:35.571
You sure you're all right,
Martha?

12:35.638 --> 12:38.004
Yes, yes.
I just wanted to make sure

12:38.071 --> 12:41.104
we don't run into
any heavy traffic.

12:58.971 --> 13:00.171
Understood.

13:00.238 --> 13:02.638
Those protocols should be
coming over shortly.

13:02.705 --> 13:05.104
Who were you
on the phone with?

13:05.171 --> 13:07.872
Homeland Security.

13:07.937 --> 13:09.338
I gave you specific orders

13:09.405 --> 13:11.037
to have everyone's systems
mirrored to mine.

13:11.104 --> 13:12.371
I've been doing that.

13:12.438 --> 13:13.304
But you're not finished,
yet somehow you have time

13:13.371 --> 13:14.571
to chat with Homeland Security.

13:14.638 --> 13:17.772
They needed us to give them
updated code sets.

13:17.838 --> 13:19.638
It'll just take
another minute.
No, it won't.

13:19.705 --> 13:20.872
Stiles, finish her task.

13:20.937 --> 13:22.004
Carrie, you're done.

13:22.071 --> 13:24.438
What do you... mean, done?

13:24.505 --> 13:27.004
Fired. You don't
work here anymore.

13:27.071 --> 13:28.605
STILES:
Mr. McGill,

13:28.671 --> 13:29.937
it's not her fault.
She just...

13:30.004 --> 13:31.872
Edgar, one more word out of you,
you walk out with her.

13:31.937 --> 13:33.937
What's it gonna be?

13:37.638 --> 13:39.805
Where's Agent O'Brian?

13:39.872 --> 13:41.538
She had to step away
for a minute.
Where?

13:41.605 --> 13:43.738
I don't know.

14:00.872 --> 14:03.438
Jack, I'm still trying
to get your credentials
into Omicron's system.

14:03.505 --> 14:05.138
You can't get into
the building without them.

14:05.204 --> 14:06.705
What's the problem?

14:06.772 --> 14:08.004
Omicron's systems
don't refresh
often enough.

14:08.071 --> 14:10.571
We need to push
this page in manually.

14:10.638 --> 14:11.937
Okay, I'm in.

14:12.004 --> 14:13.571
You're going in under the name
of John Barrie.

14:13.638 --> 14:15.004
B-A-R-R-I-E.

14:15.071 --> 14:16.471
You're with a company called

14:16.538 --> 14:17.471
Eclipse LLC.

14:17.538 --> 14:18.638
John Barrie, Eclipse LLC.

14:18.705 --> 14:19.971
I got it.

14:20.037 --> 14:21.004
Hold on a second;

14:21.071 --> 14:22.204
she hasn't
planted it yet.

14:22.271 --> 14:23.772
Chloe. What are you
doing in here?

14:23.838 --> 14:25.338
I asked her to help me.

14:25.405 --> 14:27.271
She doesn't work for you,
Ms. Raines; she works for me.

14:27.338 --> 14:28.538
But I don't,

14:28.605 --> 14:29.838
and DOD has assignment
priority

14:29.904 --> 14:31.104
over CTU.

14:31.171 --> 14:32.505
We're in the middle of a
real-time investigation,

14:32.571 --> 14:34.071
and we're understaffed.

14:34.138 --> 14:35.471
Chloe's a department head--
you can't just take her

14:35.538 --> 14:37.471
away from me.
AUDREY:
I'm not taking her from you.

14:37.538 --> 14:38.904
We needed a system patch
on a server,

14:38.971 --> 14:40.204
and Chloe's the only one
who could fix it.

14:40.271 --> 14:42.471
Well, then you come to me
and you ask me.

14:42.538 --> 14:44.304
Everything in this office
runs through me!

14:44.371 --> 14:46.705
Lynn, we are all trying
to do the same thing.

14:49.571 --> 14:51.037
Can we please
just get past this?

14:51.104 --> 14:53.071
Yeah, I'm past it.
I want Chloe back.

14:53.138 --> 14:54.805
Okay, I'm finished here.

14:54.872 --> 14:56.937
Sorry, Mr. McGill,
it won't happen again.

15:11.671 --> 15:13.071
Good afternoon.

15:13.138 --> 15:14.471
John Barrie
with Eclipse.

15:14.538 --> 15:15.904
I've got a 4:30
with R&D.

15:25.805 --> 15:27.338
Thumb print, please.

15:38.438 --> 15:39.505
Go on in.

15:39.571 --> 15:41.204
Thank you.

15:53.904 --> 15:55.338
MAN ( <i>over intercom</i> ):
Well, I'll tell you what you do.

15:55.405 --> 15:57.238
You kick the McAvoy meeting
to next week on Thursday,

15:57.304 --> 15:58.371
but you keep everything else.

15:58.438 --> 16:00.004
What about your trip
to Washington?

16:00.071 --> 16:01.705
That's right. Okay.

16:01.772 --> 16:02.937
Well, I got to talk to Kagan
tomorrow morning.

16:03.004 --> 16:04.405
I'll get back to you then.

16:04.471 --> 16:05.805
Can I help you, sir?
Yeah, I'm sorry.

16:05.872 --> 16:07.471
I'm a little lost. I was looking
for the men's room.

16:07.538 --> 16:08.872
Over there, second door.

16:08.937 --> 16:11.304
Thank you.

16:21.471 --> 16:22.904
Audrey Raines.

16:22.971 --> 16:26.071
It's Jack. I need you
to lose the secretary.

16:26.138 --> 16:27.338
Her name is Joanna Tandy.

16:27.405 --> 16:28.538
All right, I'll take care of it.

16:28.605 --> 16:29.738
Thanks.

16:49.204 --> 16:50.505
Christopher Henderson's office.

16:50.571 --> 16:52.037
Ms. Tandy?
Yes?

16:52.104 --> 16:53.805
Jane Espenson
from accounting.

16:53.872 --> 16:55.338
We need you
to come down now

16:55.405 --> 16:56.471
and double-check some
of these invoices.

16:56.538 --> 16:58.071
What invoices?

16:58.138 --> 17:00.271
It's a little difficult
to explain over the phone.

17:00.338 --> 17:02.772
Would you mind popping down
just for a minute?

17:02.838 --> 17:03.805
Fine.

17:03.872 --> 17:05.304
Thank you.

17:05.371 --> 17:07.505
Mr. Henderson, there's a problem
down in accounting.

17:07.570 --> 17:08.904
I'll be right back.

17:34.571 --> 17:36.638
Jack? Jack?

17:48.471 --> 17:52.038
Just for the record,
I never believed you were dead.

17:54.604 --> 17:56.338
What are you doing here?

17:57.305 --> 17:58.704
Earlier this morning,

17:58.771 --> 18:00.404
terrorists gained control
of a large quantity

18:00.471 --> 18:02.171
of Sentox VX
nerve gas.

18:02.238 --> 18:03.537
Omicron
manufactured it.

18:03.604 --> 18:04.838
When I pulled up
the executive list,

18:04.905 --> 18:06.005
your name was on it.

18:06.071 --> 18:07.738
Sure my name's on it--
I work here.

18:07.804 --> 18:08.871
Omicron had
the contract.

18:08.938 --> 18:10.171
We manufacture
this stuff.

18:10.238 --> 18:11.471
But every single gram of it

18:11.537 --> 18:12.537
went to the Department
of Defense.

18:12.604 --> 18:13.738
It's all been accounted for.

18:13.804 --> 18:15.471
Well, that can't be true,
now, can it?

18:15.537 --> 18:17.272
We have confirmation
that terrorists

18:17.338 --> 18:19.404
are in control
of 19 canisters of Sentox!

18:19.471 --> 18:20.738
What are you accusing me
now of, Jack?

18:20.804 --> 18:22.471
Being in bed with terrorists?

18:22.537 --> 18:23.604
I'm following
the leads!

18:23.671 --> 18:25.005
Well, the leads are wrong.

18:25.071 --> 18:27.504
DOD destroyed
the entire stockpile.

18:27.571 --> 18:30.372
Sentox was responsible
for the death of the people

18:30.437 --> 18:32.704
in the Sunrise Hills Mall
less than two hours ago.

18:32.771 --> 18:35.571
The news said it
was chlorine gas.

18:35.638 --> 18:36.571
That was a cover story
to stop

18:36.638 --> 18:38.171
a widespread panic!

18:38.238 --> 18:41.038
Come on, Christopher,
you know how this works!

18:46.738 --> 18:50.105
The terrorists have threatened
to release the rest of the gas.

18:59.105 --> 19:01.205
( <i>quietly</i> ):
Good God.

19:05.504 --> 19:07.638
Well, whoever's implicating me
in this

19:07.704 --> 19:09.071
knows my history with CTU.

19:09.138 --> 19:12.704
I mean, I'm
an easy target.

19:12.771 --> 19:15.105
This is not
a coincidence.

19:15.171 --> 19:18.738
Look, Jack, I know
there's dirt between us,

19:18.804 --> 19:20.171
but I swear to you,

19:20.238 --> 19:21.938
I got nothing
to do with this.

19:22.005 --> 19:23.838
Yeah, well, I'm sorry.
I can't afford to take

19:23.905 --> 19:24.938
your word
on this.

19:25.005 --> 19:25.771
Well, you're gonna have
to take my word.

19:25.838 --> 19:27.537
11 people died in that mall!

19:27.604 --> 19:29.804
Hundreds of thousands of others
will if they release

19:29.871 --> 19:30.905
the rest
of the Sentox.

19:30.971 --> 19:32.437
You're not hearing me, Jack!

19:32.504 --> 19:34.038
I had nothing to do with this!

19:34.105 --> 19:36.171
Then prove it to me.

19:52.571 --> 19:55.372
I need complete access
to Omicron's Sentox program.

19:55.437 --> 19:57.038
I'm doing it now.

19:57.105 --> 19:59.471
The entire operation
was run from a bunker
across the campus.

19:59.537 --> 20:02.171
Let me see the bunker.

20:44.274 --> 20:45.674
NSA chatter analysis
just came in.

20:45.741 --> 20:46.975
I decoded some
words and phrases.

20:47.041 --> 20:48.407
What were they saying?

20:48.474 --> 20:50.875
It's too scrambled to make
any complete sentences,

20:50.941 --> 20:52.975
but number strings
keep coming up.

20:53.041 --> 20:55.108
5, 110, 10.

20:55.175 --> 20:56.641
Freeways?

20:56.708 --> 20:58.775
Those are the routes
President Suvarov's
taking to the airport.

20:58.841 --> 21:00.441
The only other phrase
I could decode

21:00.508 --> 21:03.242
refers to the downtown corridor.

21:03.307 --> 21:04.841
How long ago did
this chatter start?

21:04.908 --> 21:07.608
About 30 minutes ago.

21:11.075 --> 21:13.775
Come on.

21:13.841 --> 21:16.474
Can we expand the search area?

21:16.541 --> 21:18.674
I've got CTU air surveillance
on everything east of Glendale.

21:18.741 --> 21:20.441
What about the north?
Edwards Air Force Base

21:20.508 --> 21:22.242
is giving us
support there.

21:22.307 --> 21:23.407
We're still at a dead end

21:23.474 --> 21:24.908
on finding new leads
with the nerve gas.

21:24.975 --> 21:27.041
Excuse me, Mr. McGill, we think
there might be an attack

21:27.108 --> 21:29.041
on President Suvarov's
motorcade.
What?

21:29.108 --> 21:30.307
Edgar just monitored

21:30.374 --> 21:33.075
some chatter from
NSA and ran a threat assessment.

21:33.142 --> 21:34.374
What are you doing
analyzing chatter

21:34.441 --> 21:36.108
that isn't related to finding
the nerve gas?

21:36.175 --> 21:38.075
It came through
on one of my filters.

21:38.142 --> 21:39.775
The point is, sir,
we found something.

21:39.841 --> 21:41.274
Don't you want to alert
Secret Service

21:41.341 --> 21:43.441
considering that Suvarov
is on his way to the airport?

21:43.508 --> 21:45.041
Based on
an unsubstantiated theory

21:45.108 --> 21:46.641
from a couple of analysts?

21:46.708 --> 21:49.307
I think I've been embarrassed
enough for one day.

21:49.374 --> 21:51.108
Can we at least devote
some limited resources

21:51.175 --> 21:52.708
to try to confirm this threat?

21:52.775 --> 21:53.708
I'm sorry.

21:53.775 --> 21:55.975
Maybe I wasn't clear. No.

21:56.041 --> 21:57.242
Now go downstairs

21:57.307 --> 21:59.242
and focus on what
you're supposed
to be doing.

22:12.208 --> 22:15.142
I don't think it would be
a bad idea

22:15.208 --> 22:16.875
to pass along
the intel.

22:16.941 --> 22:19.441
Well, I do.

22:19.508 --> 22:22.041
I don't want to hear
another word about it.

22:27.608 --> 22:29.841
Yes?

22:29.908 --> 22:31.041
Our men are in place.

22:31.108 --> 22:32.808
How far out are they?

22:32.875 --> 22:36.075
The motorcade will be there
in less than 20 minutes.

22:36.142 --> 22:38.008
Are you sure no one is going
to interfere with us?

22:38.075 --> 22:39.508
I don't think so.

22:39.574 --> 22:42.341
Logan knows the consequences
if that happens.

22:42.407 --> 22:43.841
But be alert.

22:43.908 --> 22:46.674
Make sure they haven't
placed any of their
people near you.

22:46.741 --> 22:51.208
If police show up,
we'll deal with them.
Good.

22:51.274 --> 22:53.708
I'll call you when it's over.

22:53.775 --> 22:55.741
Let's go, let's go.

22:58.608 --> 23:00.975
Keep them out.

23:01.041 --> 23:04.775
If things don't go as planned,
I'll use them here.

23:11.808 --> 23:14.242
I'm busy, Ms. Raines.

23:14.307 --> 23:16.175
Lynn, I just looked
at this chatter report

23:16.242 --> 23:17.574
and I definitely think
that we need

23:17.641 --> 23:19.208
to let Secret Service know
of the threat.

23:19.274 --> 23:20.574
I'm not going to repeat
my orders

23:20.641 --> 23:21.908
to every person
in this office individually.

23:21.975 --> 23:23.875
My people are not going
to chase that white elephant.

23:23.941 --> 23:25.274
They're busy trying
to locate 19 canisters

23:25.341 --> 23:26.574
of Sentox nerve gas.

23:26.641 --> 23:28.975
Has it occurred to you
that if this threat is real,

23:29.041 --> 23:30.608
then it's likely

23:30.674 --> 23:32.574
that the terrorists who have
the Sentox nerve gas

23:32.641 --> 23:34.608
are the same ones
that are planning this attack?

23:34.674 --> 23:36.274
This is an unverified threat!

23:36.341 --> 23:38.741
If you want to hand
it off to NSA, be my guest.

23:38.808 --> 23:41.674
NSA can't recall the motorcade
without going through

23:41.741 --> 23:43.441
a time-consuming
approval process.

23:43.508 --> 23:44.808
Good.

23:44.875 --> 23:47.108
That process helps eliminate
false threats.

23:47.175 --> 23:48.941
Look, we don't have that time.
According...

23:49.008 --> 23:50.142
Ms. Raines, Ms. Raines,

23:50.208 --> 23:52.441
this office has
made enough mistakes

23:52.508 --> 23:54.274
for one day, and I intend
to stop the bleeding.

23:54.341 --> 23:55.641
Now let my people

23:55.708 --> 23:56.908
focus on their work

23:56.975 --> 23:59.908
or I will have you
escorted out of here.

23:59.975 --> 24:01.341
Thank you.

24:51.808 --> 24:53.808
I need to call this in
to Secret Service,

24:53.875 --> 24:55.208
but they won't act on it

24:55.274 --> 24:56.674
unless Lynn verifies it.

24:56.741 --> 24:59.142
He's never going
to back you up on that.
Yes, he is.

24:59.208 --> 25:01.142
I need you to hack
into Lynn's account for me.

25:01.208 --> 25:02.474
I'll forge a message
to Secret Service

25:02.541 --> 25:04.307
and make it look like
it came from him.

25:04.374 --> 25:05.708
That's illegal.
Fine.

25:05.775 --> 25:07.608
Edgar, I need you to put
a blanket on my sub-net

25:07.674 --> 25:09.175
to make it look like
I'm doing something else.

25:09.242 --> 25:11.307
We could all
end up in jail.

25:11.374 --> 25:13.474
Think about it
for a second.

25:13.541 --> 25:14.975
The Russian president,
his wife,

25:15.041 --> 25:17.108
about 35 Secret Service,
all dead in a few minutes.

25:17.175 --> 25:21.641
All right, but for the record,
this is not a good idea.

25:21.708 --> 25:23.242
All right, I'll
compose a message.

25:23.307 --> 25:26.008
As soon as you have the forged
verification file, call me.

25:44.641 --> 25:45.875
Curtis.

25:45.941 --> 25:48.242
Excuse me.
We need to talk.

25:48.307 --> 25:50.242
What is it?

25:50.307 --> 25:53.708
We've got a problem
with Lynn.

25:53.775 --> 25:54.808
Yeah, I know.

25:54.875 --> 25:55.908
He's not listening
to anybody.

25:55.975 --> 25:57.608
Well, it's going to start
costing lives.

25:57.674 --> 25:59.208
Just give him some time.
He'll come around.

25:59.274 --> 26:00.508
Curtis, we don't have time.

26:00.574 --> 26:02.041
We've got to get Bill
back out here.

26:02.108 --> 26:03.941
That's not going
to happen, Audrey.

26:04.008 --> 26:05.508
We need to make it happen.

26:05.574 --> 26:06.708
What are you suggesting?

26:08.608 --> 26:10.008
Section 112.

26:10.075 --> 26:12.108
On what grounds?

26:12.175 --> 26:14.142
Lynn is mentally incapable
of running CTU.

26:14.208 --> 26:15.741
I may not agree
with all his choices,

26:15.808 --> 26:17.008
but going from there

26:17.075 --> 26:18.407
to mentally unfit?

26:18.474 --> 26:19.708
That's a stretch.

26:19.775 --> 26:20.741
No, it's not and you know it.

26:20.808 --> 26:22.574
You've seen him.

26:22.641 --> 26:24.374
With Bill in custody,
you are the ranking agent.

26:24.441 --> 26:25.407
You are the only one

26:25.474 --> 26:26.541
that can invoke it.

26:26.608 --> 26:29.474
I don't know, Audrey...
Yes, you do.

26:29.541 --> 26:32.841
Curtis, CTU is barely
functional.

26:32.908 --> 26:35.041
You are the one
that can turn it around.

26:35.108 --> 26:38.975
Even if I agreed, Section 112
requires documentation,

26:39.041 --> 26:40.407
testimony, a lot
of groundwork.

26:40.474 --> 26:42.908
The record of what is going on
right now

26:42.975 --> 26:45.407
is documentation enough.

26:45.474 --> 26:47.708
Curtis...

26:47.775 --> 26:49.108
please.

26:49.175 --> 26:50.242
Think about it.

26:50.307 --> 26:53.775
I will.

26:53.841 --> 26:55.541
Good. Thank you.

27:23.374 --> 27:25.108
Mr. President.

27:27.674 --> 27:30.908
Come in, Mike.

27:30.975 --> 27:32.175
The motorcade

27:32.242 --> 27:35.341
is only 15 minutes
away from the airport.

27:35.407 --> 27:37.441
Yeah.

27:44.708 --> 27:48.274
My father always told me that
life was about problem solving.

27:48.341 --> 27:51.108
That every problem
had a solution.

27:51.175 --> 27:52.641
You tell me where
the solution is

27:52.708 --> 27:54.808
on this one.

28:04.374 --> 28:09.041
I don't have an answer,
Mr. President.

28:09.108 --> 28:12.474
But if you want
the Suvarov motorcade

28:12.541 --> 28:14.374
to turn back,

28:14.441 --> 28:16.975
I need to do it now.

28:27.741 --> 28:30.008
We know the terrorists are
willing to kill civilians.

28:30.075 --> 28:34.242
And the low... the low end
of the casualty range

28:34.307 --> 28:36.741
on this one is...

28:36.808 --> 28:38.641
100,000 lives.

28:38.708 --> 28:40.441
Yes, sir.

28:40.508 --> 28:46.941
I decided before that I couldn't
risk all those lives

28:47.008 --> 28:49.674
to save one man--
the Russian president.

28:49.741 --> 28:54.608
I can't risk those lives now...

28:54.674 --> 28:57.975
( <i>voice breaking</i> ):
even to save my own wife.

28:58.041 --> 28:59.941
Damn you, Martha,

29:00.008 --> 29:03.541
for putting me in this position.

29:03.608 --> 29:05.341
You brought it on yourself.

29:13.175 --> 29:15.274
Mike...

29:24.775 --> 29:26.708
Pray with me, Mike.

29:31.407 --> 29:36.075
Uh, Mr. President,
with all due respect,

29:36.142 --> 29:40.108
this is a personal matter.

29:40.175 --> 29:41.841
I don't...

29:41.908 --> 29:43.574
Please, Mike.

29:59.674 --> 30:01.741
How much longer
until we can send this out?

30:01.808 --> 30:03.307
A couple of minutes.
I've almost hacked in.

30:03.374 --> 30:05.108
We don't have
a couple of minutes.

30:05.175 --> 30:06.608
EDGAR:
I'm almost there.

30:07.641 --> 30:08.574
Oh, no.

30:08.641 --> 30:09.841
Lynn cut us off.

30:09.908 --> 30:11.008
What do I do?

30:11.075 --> 30:12.975
I think it's too late
to do anything.

30:17.975 --> 30:19.008
Mr. Stiles,

30:19.075 --> 30:20.841
did you really think
I wouldn't notice

30:20.908 --> 30:22.208
that you were trying
to access my com?

30:22.274 --> 30:24.307
Lynn, listen, we need to talk...
Shut up!

30:24.374 --> 30:25.841
These people are working
against CTU protocols.

30:25.908 --> 30:27.142
That means they're
working against me.

30:27.208 --> 30:28.274
Lynn, what is this?

30:28.341 --> 30:29.374
We were trying to warn
Secret Service

30:29.441 --> 30:31.008
on an attack
on Suvarov's
motorcade.

30:31.075 --> 30:32.341
Curtis, take Mr. Stiles
and Ms. O'Brian--

30:32.407 --> 30:33.641
put them in holding.

30:33.708 --> 30:35.508
And then escort Audrey Raines
out of CTU.

30:35.574 --> 30:36.841
I can't do that.

30:36.908 --> 30:38.208
Yes, you can, Curtis.

30:38.274 --> 30:39.908
It's a direct order.

30:39.975 --> 30:40.975
Now do it.

30:41.041 --> 30:42.474
You forced them
to work covertly.

30:42.541 --> 30:43.708
They had no choice.

30:43.775 --> 30:44.841
You're not behaving
rationally, Lynn.

30:44.908 --> 30:46.474
LYNN:
You and you,

30:46.541 --> 30:48.474
take them all into custody
including Mr. Manning.

30:48.541 --> 30:50.407
CURTIS:
If you try to carry out
that command,

30:50.474 --> 30:51.741
I will draw my weapon.

30:51.808 --> 30:53.541
If he draws his weapon,
shoot him.

30:53.608 --> 30:55.341
CURTIS:
This situation is already
getting out of control.

30:55.407 --> 30:56.374
Don't make it worse.

30:56.441 --> 30:57.975
McGILL:
Why are you hesitating?!

30:58.041 --> 30:59.508
I gave you an order.
Now do it!

31:05.075 --> 31:07.541
What would you like me to do,
Mr. Manning?

31:07.608 --> 31:08.841
What?!

31:08.908 --> 31:10.741
Lynn McGill, I'm relieving you
of your command

31:10.808 --> 31:13.307
under the incapacity clause
of Section 112.

31:13.374 --> 31:15.041
You'll do no such thing.

31:15.108 --> 31:16.208
Take him away.

31:16.307 --> 31:17.407
You can't do that.

31:19.841 --> 31:21.674
He can't do this.
Don't touch me.

31:23.908 --> 31:26.908
This is an unjustified
usurpation of my authority.

31:26.975 --> 31:27.941
Do you hear me?

31:28.008 --> 31:30.242
We're in the middle
of a crisis.

31:30.307 --> 31:32.441
There are going to be
repercussions.

31:32.508 --> 31:35.407
Everyone involved in this
is going to face prosecution.

31:38.108 --> 31:40.341
This is Curtis Manning.

31:40.407 --> 31:42.641
Release Bill Buchanan
from holding

31:42.708 --> 31:44.407
and inform Division that
he's been reinstated

31:44.474 --> 31:46.075
as director of CTU

31:46.142 --> 31:47.708
under Section 112 provisions.

31:49.142 --> 31:51.208
Everyone, get back

31:51.274 --> 31:53.641
to your stations.

32:07.828 --> 32:10.228
Fill me in.
Chloe and Edgar
detected chatter

32:10.294 --> 32:12.561
indicating a possible attack on
President Suvarov's motorcade

32:12.628 --> 32:15.094
en route to the airport.
How'd they get
Suvarov's route?

32:15.161 --> 32:16.628
We don't know, but
the most likely

32:16.695 --> 32:18.628
point of intercept
is the downtown corridor.

32:18.695 --> 32:21.094
Has Secret Service
been notified?
Lynn refused to do so.

32:21.161 --> 32:22.762
Notify Secret Service now.
I need your

32:22.828 --> 32:24.994
level one access
code to override the
firewall Lynn put up.

32:25.061 --> 32:26.361
Here.
I need Carrie back.

32:26.428 --> 32:29.994
He fired her for no reason.
Have security reinstate her.

32:30.061 --> 32:32.294
Edgar, pull up satellite and all
possible intercept points,

32:32.361 --> 32:33.927
and call the president.

32:33.994 --> 32:35.495
Yes, sir.
Where are we on

32:35.561 --> 32:37.661
the location of the
nerve gas canisters?
No substantial progress.

32:37.728 --> 32:40.862
What about the lead
Jack was following?
He traced the Sentox

32:40.927 --> 32:42.828
back to Omicron International
where it was manufactured.

32:42.894 --> 32:44.395
Is that where Jack is now?

32:44.461 --> 32:46.495
Yes.
EDGAR:
Mr. Buchanan,

32:46.561 --> 32:48.361
president's on the line.

32:48.428 --> 32:50.094
Mr. President,
we have intelligence

32:50.161 --> 32:53.027
that indicates
President Suvarov's motorcade

32:53.094 --> 32:55.395
may be attacked
in the next few minutes.

33:00.428 --> 33:01.561
Is that so?

33:01.628 --> 33:02.894
Yes, sir.

33:02.961 --> 33:05.328
We are in the process
of notifying Secret Service.

33:05.395 --> 33:09.027
What we <i>can</i> tell you is that
if the attack happens

33:09.094 --> 33:11.395
it will occur
in or around the downtown area.

33:11.461 --> 33:15.128
The motorcade is approaching
that area now, sir.

33:19.027 --> 33:20.862
Mr. President?

33:26.461 --> 33:29.961
Bill. Mike Novick.

33:30.027 --> 33:33.828
The president is at a loss
for words.

33:33.894 --> 33:37.795
His wife is
in the Suvarov's limousine.

33:42.961 --> 33:45.795
Thank you.
You've done a good job.

33:49.027 --> 33:50.495
What do we do?

33:50.561 --> 33:53.561
There's nothing we <i>can</i> do, sir.

33:53.628 --> 33:58.061
CTU is informing
the Secret Service.

33:58.128 --> 34:02.228
They'll no doubt take
defensive measures,

34:02.294 --> 34:03.461
which makes the attack

34:03.528 --> 34:06.261
substantially less likely
to succeed.

34:20.194 --> 34:21.328
AARON:
Yes, sir.

34:22.360 --> 34:23.893
Protocol red.

34:23.960 --> 34:25.561
Protocol red.
Hold on tight.

34:25.628 --> 34:27.428
We're turning around--
we just received intelligence

34:27.495 --> 34:29.695
about a threat
to the motorcade.

34:31.194 --> 34:32.328
They're turning around!

34:38.328 --> 34:39.395
We're under attack!

34:39.460 --> 34:41.460
We need backup now!

34:55.527 --> 34:58.595
It's a missile fire.
The motorcade's been hit.

34:59.661 --> 35:01.061
A-Aaron?

35:01.128 --> 35:02.495
Aaron?

35:02.561 --> 35:03.661
Oh, my God...

35:51.961 --> 35:54.461
( <i>softly</i> ):
Aaron... Aaron...

35:54.528 --> 35:56.161
It's okay.

35:56.228 --> 35:57.728
Are you okay?

36:13.528 --> 36:14.862
Novick.

36:14.927 --> 36:16.828
Yeah, Frank.

36:16.894 --> 36:19.661
How badly?

36:19.728 --> 36:21.695
And what about
Mrs. Logan?

36:23.994 --> 36:25.961
I will. Thank you.

36:27.661 --> 36:30.228
Your wife survived
the attack.

36:32.261 --> 36:34.061
CTU intervened in time.

36:36.862 --> 36:38.628
Thank God.

36:40.528 --> 36:42.894
What about the Suvarovs?

36:42.961 --> 36:46.561
They were shaken up,
but, uh, they'll be okay.

36:51.161 --> 36:53.027
He's going to think
I tipped off CTU.

36:53.094 --> 36:55.528
It won't matter to him
that I tried to keep

36:55.595 --> 36:57.061
my end of the bargain.

36:58.094 --> 37:01.027
I agree.

37:01.971 --> 37:03.971
?????

37:18.808 --> 37:22.208
All the work
on the Sentox project
was run out of here.

37:22.274 --> 37:24.208
How restricted
was the access?

37:24.274 --> 37:26.741
Extremely. For security reasons,
each defense contract

37:26.808 --> 37:29.775
was run out of its own
separate dedicated bunker,

37:29.842 --> 37:31.908
each bunker's a completely
sealed environment.

37:31.974 --> 37:35.374
Nothing gets in
and nothing gets out.

37:44.074 --> 37:47.274
This is gonna
take some time.

37:47.341 --> 37:48.875
I've got to merge some files,

37:48.942 --> 37:50.441
find out who's working
on this project.

37:50.508 --> 37:52.541
You're Senior Vice President
and you don't know?

37:52.608 --> 37:54.942
Give me a break, Jack--
there's 8,000 people

37:55.007 --> 37:56.374
that work for this company.

37:56.441 --> 37:59.641
I got to run a sort--
it's gonna take me a minute.

37:59.708 --> 38:02.842
So who's the honcho
over at CTU now?

38:02.908 --> 38:06.007
Bill Buchanan.

38:06.074 --> 38:07.675
( <i>chuckles</i> ):
Buchanan. What a stiff.

38:07.741 --> 38:09.842
No wonder everything's
going to hell over there.

38:09.908 --> 38:11.541
You guys keep getting rid

38:11.608 --> 38:13.374
of everybody
who can do their job.

38:13.441 --> 38:14.608
You made your own bed.

38:14.675 --> 38:16.374
You accused
the wrong man, Jack.

38:16.441 --> 38:19.141
I wasn't the lead investigator;
I showed them what I found.

38:19.208 --> 38:20.974
I was framed.
By who?

38:21.041 --> 38:24.641
Nina Myers, George Mason...
Who knows?

38:26.341 --> 38:28.908
But I'll tell you, the one thing
that just hangs on me,

38:28.974 --> 38:30.741
I'll tell you,
the one thing that just...

38:30.808 --> 38:34.475
hurts me is that
you didn't believe me.

38:35.842 --> 38:38.308
You made it impossible
to believe you.

38:38.374 --> 38:40.408
How could I possibly defend you?

38:40.475 --> 38:43.575
You wouldn't even
defend yourself.

38:43.641 --> 38:47.007
No one gave me the chance.

38:54.274 --> 38:56.274
Okay, we got
something here.

38:56.341 --> 38:58.274
Lead scientist,
head of Project Sentox--

38:58.341 --> 39:00.308
Alan Burkett, PhD.

39:00.374 --> 39:02.174
I'm gonna need
to speak to him.

39:02.241 --> 39:03.842
Well, you're gonna
have a problem.

39:03.908 --> 39:06.241
Died in a helicopter crash
in Geneva two years ago.

39:06.308 --> 39:10.074
Let's see what else we got.

39:10.141 --> 39:11.541
This is bizarre.

39:11.608 --> 39:13.308
Two other senior
scientists

39:13.374 --> 39:15.775
on the Sentox project--
one drowned on a diving trip

39:15.842 --> 39:17.808
in the Bahamas,
the other burned to death

39:17.875 --> 39:19.675
in a car accident
two weeks later.

39:19.741 --> 39:21.308
What the hell is going on?

39:21.374 --> 39:22.675
CTU's gonna have

39:22.741 --> 39:24.074
to break it down.

39:24.141 --> 39:26.608
How do I upload the files
and get them ready to transfer?

39:26.675 --> 39:27.608
We need I.T.

39:27.675 --> 39:28.641
They're next-door.

39:28.708 --> 39:30.608
I'll get somebody to help us.

39:30.675 --> 39:31.942
I'll CTU know that

39:32.007 --> 39:34.141
we're sending the files over.

39:41.341 --> 39:43.875
Hello?

39:43.942 --> 39:45.875
Damn it.

40:18.241 --> 40:20.608
Oh, my God.

40:20.675 --> 40:22.842
How could I be so stupid?

40:27.641 --> 40:30.074
WOMAN ( <i>over phone</i> ):
Yes?
Yeah, it's me.

40:30.141 --> 40:32.174
I listened to everything
Bauer had to say

40:32.241 --> 40:34.274
about the thumb drive--
CTU does not have

40:34.341 --> 40:36.107
enough information to hurt us.

40:36.174 --> 40:37.942
What about Bauer?

40:38.007 --> 40:42.007
Well, in about one minute,
he'll be dead.

42:02.541 --> 42:04.775
Tell the media we don't know how

42:04.842 --> 42:07.808
the terrorists found out
about the Suvarovs' route.

42:07.875 --> 42:10.274
We're looking
into it now.

42:11.675 --> 42:13.974
Mike, I've been thinking that...

42:14.041 --> 42:17.641
diplomatically, we should
play up the fact that Martha

42:17.708 --> 42:19.842
was in the vehicle.
Why is that, sir?

42:19.908 --> 42:22.174
It will get rid of any suspicion
that we might have been...

42:22.241 --> 42:24.775
( <i>phone rings</i> )
shortchanging
Suvarov's security.

42:27.541 --> 42:29.241
There he is.

42:35.408 --> 42:37.007
Hello.

42:37.074 --> 42:38.808
I thought we had
an understanding.

42:38.875 --> 42:40.508
I had nothing
to do with this.

42:40.575 --> 42:42.775
You have to believe me.
It was your job

42:42.842 --> 42:44.074
to make sure no
one interfered

42:44.141 --> 42:45.575
with the attack
on the Suvarovs.

42:45.641 --> 42:47.508
It happened outside
of my authority.

42:47.575 --> 42:49.107
I told no one.

42:49.174 --> 42:52.208
If Russia isn't going to pay
with the life of its president,

42:52.274 --> 42:54.041
then its new ally,
the United States,

42:54.107 --> 42:56.741
will pay with the lives
of its citizens.

42:56.808 --> 42:58.741
Mr. President,
this is our final conversation.

42:58.808 --> 43:01.541
Good-bye.
No. Wait!
