00:23.847 --> 00:26.531
<i>But I do know that
Logue used his daughter,</i>

00:26.567 --> 00:29.646
<i>Astra, as a focal point for spells.</i>

00:29.966 --> 00:34.063
<i>A human channel to draw the dark
magic down into the physical world.</i>

00:38.487 --> 00:40.540
<i>His own child!</i>

00:42.750 --> 00:44.264
<i>Can you imagine?</i>

00:45.180 --> 00:46.680
<i>Oh, it was bad.</i>

00:49.200 --> 00:53.020
<i>And then, John Constantine
went and made it worse.</i>

00:55.390 --> 00:59.510
<i>You see, John was another one
who fancied himself a magician.</i>

01:00.140 --> 01:02.780
<i>Been studying the occult
since he was a boy,</i>

01:03.250 --> 01:05.050
<i>claimed he had a natural gift.</i>

01:06.420 --> 01:08.410
<i>Logue had been a mentor to him,</i>

01:08.615 --> 01:11.615
<i>but when John found out what
was happening with the girl,</i>

01:12.345 --> 01:14.935
<i>he decided he was gonna save Astra.</i>

01:15.399 --> 01:17.558
<i>He could've just called the cops,</i>

01:17.594 --> 01:19.629
<i>but that would've
been too easy.</i>

01:19.665 --> 01:21.665
<i>And of course, Chas,</i>

01:21.830 --> 01:23.174
<i>the loyal idiot,</i>

01:23.210 --> 01:24.715
<i>was right there with him.</i>

01:24.750 --> 01:27.379
<i>And what better way to stop a devil</i>

01:27.415 --> 01:30.252
<i>like Alex Logue than by
summoning a bigger one.</i>

01:47.420 --> 01:48.980
<i>A real one.</i>

01:53.080 --> 01:54.584
<i>That was John's logic.</i>

01:55.476 --> 01:56.846
<i>And it worked...</i>

01:57.000 --> 01:58.290
<i>up to a point.</i>

02:42.060 --> 02:44.065
<i>John thought he could use Nergal</i>

02:44.101 --> 02:46.221
<i>to put the fear into Logue
and his friends,</i>

02:46.950 --> 02:48.620
<i>and get Astra away from them.</i>

02:49.220 --> 02:51.220
<i>But he was arrogant even then.</i>

02:53.560 --> 02:56.970
<i>Our John didn't know half
of what he thought he did.</i>

02:59.420 --> 03:02.580
<i>So, he never wove a binding
spell around the demon,</i>

03:03.040 --> 03:05.438
<i>which means he couldn't control it.</i>

03:06.000 --> 03:07.780
<i>Couldn't stop Nergal...</i>

03:16.580 --> 03:19.180
<i>from unleashing hell on Earth.</i>

03:39.210 --> 03:41.047
<i>Some got out, some didn't,</i>

03:41.914 --> 03:43.494
<i>and John...</i>

03:44.980 --> 03:48.410
<i>Well, he learned that night
that his natural gift...</i>

03:50.280 --> 03:51.780
<i>wasn't gift enough.</i>

04:11.790 --> 04:13.290
No!

04:28.500 --> 04:31.564
<i>And that's how John
ended up in Ravenscote.</i>

04:36.420 --> 04:38.214
<i>And my Chas just</i>

04:38.250 --> 04:40.450
- <i>soldiered on all those years...</i>
- No! No! No! No!

04:40.750 --> 04:42.806
- <i>Pretending everything was all right.</i>
- No! No! No! No!

04:42.830 --> 04:44.420
No! No! No! No!

04:44.750 --> 04:46.463
<i>I believed him, too.</i>

04:47.750 --> 04:50.541
<i>But once you've been through
something like that,</i>

04:51.020 --> 04:52.510
<i>it never can be.</i>

05:02.110 --> 05:03.220
Can it?

05:12.290 --> 05:13.800
About Newcastle?

05:13.836 --> 05:15.796
No, I can't, I...

05:16.920 --> 05:18.215
I just...

05:18.250 --> 05:19.922
Mmm, it's all right.

05:20.210 --> 05:22.920
If you don't wanna tell me,
you don't have to.
