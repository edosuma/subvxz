WEBVTT

00:06.000 --> 00:09.920
A NETFLIX SERIES

00:24.000 --> 00:26.080
BOSS

00:26.160 --> 00:30.080
Seagull in nest.
Three hours, zero minutes, one second.

00:30.800 --> 00:31.800
I repeat.

00:31.880 --> 00:34.840
Three hours, zero minutes, one second.

01:41.320 --> 01:46.200
"Seagull in nest.
Three hours, zero minutes, one second."

01:47.400 --> 01:48.800
What a weird guy.

01:58.080 --> 01:59.800
<i>It was urgent love</i>

01:59.880 --> 02:03.760
<i>The two of them alone, almost alone</i>

02:03.840 --> 02:07.880
<i>Our lips simply</i>

02:07.960 --> 02:09.920
<i>Time passed</i>

02:10.000 --> 02:11.880
<i>I had time</i>

02:11.960 --> 02:16.040
<i>Long wait that I lived without you</i>

02:16.120 --> 02:20.120
<i>Today I miss your memory</i>

02:20.200 --> 02:24.520
<i>Which slowly is getting lost</i>

02:25.040 --> 02:28.720
<i>From your hands, your caresses</i>

02:30.720 --> 02:31.680
Good morning.

02:35.240 --> 02:36.600
You have something here.

02:36.680 --> 02:37.920
It looks like a tattoo.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.480
It's my birthmark.

02:41.000 --> 02:42.120
You were smiling.

02:42.200 --> 02:45.760
-Smiling?
-Yes, just now, while sleeping.

02:47.800 --> 02:48.680
Yeah.

02:51.160 --> 02:52.600
I had a wonderful dream.

02:53.640 --> 02:55.360
I was at the old Sky Vibes.

02:56.640 --> 02:59.720
When something like that
happens to me, I write it down.

02:59.800 --> 03:02.320
It could be a sentence I like,

03:02.400 --> 03:03.400
an idea,

03:04.040 --> 03:05.320
a thought,

03:06.120 --> 03:08.160
or a dream like you had.

03:09.040 --> 03:11.160
It's just that thoughts don't have a form.

03:11.640 --> 03:14.560
When you put them on paper,
you give them shape.

03:14.640 --> 03:16.680
-Look.
-Let's see.

03:19.680 --> 03:24.080
"Now's the time. Now it is.
Now I am. Now I go."

03:25.760 --> 03:29.840
"I want to be, take a risk.
There's no other way but to try." Wow!

03:29.920 --> 03:30.760
What?

03:33.120 --> 03:36.400
-I think this could be a song.
-Seriously?

03:37.200 --> 03:38.040
Yeah, look.

03:40.280 --> 03:41.480
<i>Now's the time</i>

03:43.160 --> 03:44.440
<i>Now it is</i>

03:45.400 --> 03:46.840
<i>Now I am</i>

03:48.440 --> 03:49.920
<i>Now I go</i>

03:51.400 --> 03:54.520
<i>I want to be, take a risk</i>

03:58.280 --> 04:01.880
<i>There's no other way but to try</i>

04:45.640 --> 04:47.960
This is gonna be harder than I thought.

04:52.960 --> 04:56.960
ARE YOU COMING?
YOUR BREAKFAST IS READY

05:11.160 --> 05:13.760
Ron Navarro.

05:33.400 --> 05:35.360
-I'm glad I found you.
-Are you leaving?

05:35.440 --> 05:40.320
No, but I wanted to ask for forgiveness.
I intend to make up for it.

05:40.400 --> 05:43.600
You can right now
by packing up your stuff and leaving.

05:43.680 --> 05:44.800
It's not that hard.

05:44.880 --> 05:47.680
-You were supposed to go to Orlando.
-And you to Tulum.

05:47.760 --> 05:51.440
-We have every right to be here.
-You don't have anything to do here, Dad.

05:53.280 --> 05:55.120
Steffi, let's at least talk.

05:56.000 --> 05:58.120
I don't want to. You went too far.

05:58.200 --> 06:00.560
You know I don't like you around
when I compete.

06:00.640 --> 06:03.000
We both went too far.
But I'm not blaming you.

06:03.080 --> 06:06.560
I'm just asking for five minutes.
I think we can come to an agreement.

06:25.280 --> 06:26.920
-It's good.
-I like this.

06:28.120 --> 06:29.160
She's coming out.

06:30.040 --> 06:32.280
-Who? The girl in back?
-With the glasses.

06:32.360 --> 06:33.280
WELCOME!

06:33.320 --> 06:34.920
Matrix! Hi!

06:35.440 --> 06:37.440
-Matrix!
-Matrix, over here!

06:38.200 --> 06:40.800
-She's coming. She saw us.
-Yeah. I think so.

06:41.320 --> 06:42.720
Amazing.

06:43.320 --> 06:44.360
I'm Matrix, Augusto.

06:44.440 --> 06:47.480
Your profile picture is a mess.
I don't even recognize you.

06:47.560 --> 06:49.560
I'm glad. <i>Bienvenidos. </i>This is Charly.

06:49.640 --> 06:51.400
<i>Bienvenides, </i>in any case.

06:52.480 --> 06:54.640
Now I see
why you didn't answer my messages.

06:54.720 --> 06:55.720
What messages?

06:57.960 --> 06:59.200
What do I know?

06:59.960 --> 07:01.280
Hello.

07:02.160 --> 07:05.920
Welcome to the Paleolithic era, Matrix.
I'm dealing with analog dinosaurs.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.240
Incredible.

07:14.040 --> 07:15.360
They have a lot of fans.

07:17.320 --> 07:19.240
This'll be great for Cielo Grande.

07:21.160 --> 07:23.680
Come on! Nice!

07:27.480 --> 07:28.320
Okay, people.

07:28.400 --> 07:31.120
<i>We've arrived. And here are our fans.</i>

07:32.040 --> 07:33.640
<i>Stay tuned for our next post.</i>

07:33.720 --> 07:37.080
<i>We have a show in the water</i>
<i>and other surprises in the river.</i>

07:37.160 --> 07:38.640
<i>And as always, kids,</i>

07:38.720 --> 07:41.440
<i>if you like the video,</i>
<i>don't forget to leave us a like.</i>

07:41.520 --> 07:43.600
<i>And thanks to our fans for coming out.</i>

07:43.680 --> 07:44.840
<i>The end of the world!</i>

07:46.880 --> 07:50.240
Let's see. Sorry, Matrix.
We're not at the end of the world.

07:50.320 --> 07:53.040
We agreed they'd mention Cielo Grande.

07:54.800 --> 07:58.760
And are we already
in Cielo Grande, triceratops?

08:00.520 --> 08:03.920
No, so our contract
isn't in effect yet, okay?

08:04.000 --> 08:05.640
Those are my bags.

08:06.800 --> 08:08.040
This'll be complicated.

08:14.320 --> 08:16.600
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.120
I'm starting to like it here.

08:23.880 --> 08:27.520
Oh yeah? And that wouldn't be because
you ran into Lucecita, would it?

08:30.200 --> 08:31.480
Look at this picture.

08:37.720 --> 08:39.360
Where did you find it?

08:40.000 --> 08:42.760
In the hotel storeroom
that Luz is remodeling.

08:47.000 --> 08:47.880
Is that your mom?

08:48.920 --> 08:52.160
No. That's my dad, but she's…

08:52.760 --> 08:53.960
She's not your mother.

08:54.040 --> 08:57.160
No. I've seen photos of my mom,
and she doesn't look like that.

09:00.160 --> 09:02.080
How old were you…

09:02.160 --> 09:03.240
When she died?

09:04.240 --> 09:05.600
Almost eight months.

09:05.680 --> 09:07.000
Eight months.

09:07.080 --> 09:10.320
Yeah. And then I went
to live with my grandparents.

09:12.800 --> 09:13.640
Oh well.

09:14.160 --> 09:16.880
-Can I keep this picture?
-Yeah, it's yours.

09:21.280 --> 09:23.200
Let's go to this table, Ian.

09:29.840 --> 09:31.200
What's up with them?

09:31.280 --> 09:33.720
My father, brother, and I agreed

09:33.800 --> 09:35.640
we'd pretend not to know each other.

09:35.720 --> 09:39.960
If one of us breaks the agreement,
they'll pack their bags and leave.

09:41.360 --> 09:42.800
They'll be invisible.

09:44.320 --> 09:45.200
Invisible?

09:45.720 --> 09:46.640
Invisible.

09:50.880 --> 09:53.280
That's a strange way of acting invisible.

09:54.960 --> 09:55.880
Hi, Augusto.

09:58.240 --> 09:59.960
"Can you come immediately?"

10:00.040 --> 10:01.120
Yeah, don't worry.

10:01.200 --> 10:02.520
-Did something happen?
-No.

10:02.600 --> 10:03.880
Well, maybe yes.

10:04.600 --> 10:06.440
But nothing serious. I mean, yeah.

10:06.520 --> 10:08.920
I made an agreement
with some digital guys.

10:09.000 --> 10:10.320
-Influencers.
-That's it.

10:10.400 --> 10:12.520
It's all Greek to me.

10:12.600 --> 10:14.840
And their manager, that girl, Matrix,

10:16.040 --> 10:17.360
is from another planet.

10:17.440 --> 10:20.960
Difficult. That's why
I wanted to ask for your help.

10:21.040 --> 10:22.080
-Me?
-Yes.

10:22.160 --> 10:24.600
Let me tell you about the agreement.

10:25.200 --> 10:28.000
What I agreed to with them
could save Cielo Grande.

10:28.600 --> 10:30.520
Yes, of course, Augusto. Count on me.

10:34.160 --> 10:37.520
I don't know if we should be here
without permission.

10:37.600 --> 10:40.480
Stop it, Tony.
It's just an empty storeroom.

10:40.560 --> 10:42.080
Why would we need permission?

10:42.840 --> 10:46.520
Plus, this photo is of my dad.
Where did you find it?

10:47.240 --> 10:48.120
Over here.

10:49.000 --> 10:50.800
Right

10:51.760 --> 10:52.640
here.

11:05.240 --> 11:07.200
There are more photos of my dad here.

11:14.200 --> 11:15.720
Are there more of the girl?

11:18.520 --> 11:21.480
INCOMING CALL

11:22.000 --> 11:23.040
Luz.

11:26.040 --> 11:29.480
-It's Luz. What should I say?
-We'll be there in five minutes.

11:30.240 --> 11:33.320
We'll be there
in five minutes. Sorry we're late.

11:33.400 --> 11:34.240
Bye.

11:35.360 --> 11:36.240
Let's go.

11:42.440 --> 11:44.520
Hi, boys. Ready to order?

11:44.600 --> 11:45.680
-Yes.
-Yes.

11:46.200 --> 11:50.080
A chocolate shake,
lemon pudding with dulce de leche,

11:50.160 --> 11:51.640
and a chocolate chip muffin.

11:52.160 --> 11:54.840
No. Can the shake have nuts and cinnamon?

11:55.360 --> 11:57.120
No. Chocolate and honey.

11:58.080 --> 12:00.560
And the pudding
without the dulce de leche.

12:00.640 --> 12:02.160
And for you?

12:02.240 --> 12:06.560
I'll have a triple burger
with double bacon,

12:06.640 --> 12:08.320
cheddar and aioli fries,

12:08.400 --> 12:11.160
and a tonic to drink.

12:11.240 --> 12:12.960
-Okay.
-And some chips.

12:13.040 --> 12:14.560
-Okay.
-No, you know what?

12:14.640 --> 12:17.600
I prefer a lemonade
with a dash of mint and ginger.

12:18.600 --> 12:20.080
No, better without ginger.

12:20.160 --> 12:21.840
And the fries with blue cheese.

12:21.920 --> 12:24.840
-Are you expecting someone else?
-No, just us.

12:24.920 --> 12:26.320
We love eating.

12:27.840 --> 12:28.880
-All right.
-Thanks.

12:29.480 --> 12:31.720
<i>I know without you, I can't go on</i>

12:31.800 --> 12:34.880
<i>A little longer and you'll forget me</i>

12:34.960 --> 12:37.000
<i>Without you, I no longer exist</i>

12:37.080 --> 12:39.600
<i>Come with me</i>
<i>What will it be?</i>

12:40.600 --> 12:42.680
-You know it.
-Hi. What's up?

12:43.800 --> 12:47.200
Sorry for interrupting, friends.
I need to talk to you.

12:47.720 --> 12:51.000
-Do you want an autograph?
-No. No need.

12:51.080 --> 12:53.880
I need to talk with you
influencer to influencer.

12:55.240 --> 12:56.640
This is business.

12:59.920 --> 13:04.520
Surely you know my face.
I'm Ian from Ian Tech.

13:04.600 --> 13:05.680
Ian what?

13:05.760 --> 13:09.320
Tech. Ian Tech. I can't believe
you haven't heard of me.

13:09.400 --> 13:10.800
Doesn't ring a bell, man.

13:10.880 --> 13:12.920
The channel is about to explode.

13:13.000 --> 13:16.320
And I see an opportunity
for us to do some collabs.

13:17.760 --> 13:20.760
Look, kid. For collabs,
you have to talk with Matrix.

13:20.840 --> 13:22.280
She's our agent.

13:22.360 --> 13:25.000
That's right, brother.
We don't deal with the money.

13:30.080 --> 13:32.080
<i>Now I'm the one who wants an autograph.</i>

13:32.160 --> 13:35.600
An autograph with your phone number,
a link to your social media,

13:35.680 --> 13:37.160
and access to your secrets.

13:37.240 --> 13:38.320
Way to break the ice.

13:38.400 --> 13:40.560
-What are you saying?
-Oh, right. Sorry.

13:40.640 --> 13:44.120
Sometimes my icebreakers melt
or fall flat.

13:44.200 --> 13:47.520
Seriously, it would be an honor
to get your phone number.

13:47.600 --> 13:49.240
No way. You wish.

13:51.240 --> 13:55.560
Juan, your lines were a mess.
Can I give you some advice?

13:58.800 --> 14:01.960
What advice are you gonna give me?
You're a tech nerd.

14:03.560 --> 14:04.560
She's my sister.

14:05.960 --> 14:07.480
-Wait.
-I know her well.

14:07.560 --> 14:09.320
Without me, you won't get anywhere.

14:09.400 --> 14:12.160
All right, kid, now let's start over.

14:13.120 --> 14:14.960
-I'm all ears.
-Perfect.

14:15.040 --> 14:17.280
We were talking business.
Without middlemen.

14:17.360 --> 14:19.840
So take Matrix out of this.

14:29.800 --> 14:31.920
How long have you worked at Cielo Grande?

14:32.560 --> 14:34.080
It feels like forever.

14:34.680 --> 14:36.360
I was practically born here.

14:36.960 --> 14:39.280
And I've been running it for eight years.

14:40.040 --> 14:43.800
I keep trying to remember when
you were here, but I can't pinpoint it.

14:43.880 --> 14:45.080
It'll come to me.

14:45.160 --> 14:47.440
I often get mistaken
for Leonardo DiCaprio.

14:48.480 --> 14:49.560
You do look like him.

14:57.200 --> 14:58.480
Where are we going?

14:59.080 --> 15:01.160
To a canal that's always calm.

15:01.240 --> 15:03.200
It's ideal for your first training run.

15:03.280 --> 15:05.720
Your dad competed at Cielo Grande, right?

15:05.800 --> 15:07.480
Yeah, and he won in his category.

15:08.720 --> 15:11.480
I wish I could've seen him compete.

15:11.560 --> 15:14.720
Me too. He told me
it was his favorite competition.

15:16.760 --> 15:18.760
Think they have records from that era?

15:19.360 --> 15:23.920
Yeah, there are newspaper clippings,
autographed pennants, photos, all that.

15:24.440 --> 15:27.280
-Where?
-In Augusto's office.

15:48.360 --> 15:51.520
I see you're making new friends.
How's it going with the twins?

15:51.600 --> 15:56.200
Perfect. We have a business deal.
Soon we'll be cross collaborating.

15:56.280 --> 15:58.120
-Cross collaborating?
-Of course.

15:58.200 --> 15:59.920
They're gonna be in my next video.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.440
I hope to get to
200,000 subscribers with them.

16:03.760 --> 16:05.680
-You have a channel?
-Yes.

16:05.760 --> 16:07.760
Ian Tech. I'll send you the link later.

16:15.120 --> 16:18.000
And you? How long have you
been coming to Cielo Grande?

16:18.720 --> 16:20.720
I was practically born here.

16:20.800 --> 16:23.240
My grandparents were
water-ski instructors.

16:23.800 --> 16:26.920
My mom was also an incredible water-skier.

16:27.000 --> 16:29.880
She had to quit to raise me full time

16:29.960 --> 16:31.440
when my dad left us.

16:32.000 --> 16:33.720
All this was before I was born.

16:33.800 --> 16:35.240
Do you see him?

16:36.640 --> 16:39.280
No. And I don't care to.
My mom never talks about it.

16:39.360 --> 16:42.480
She always told me
to leave it where it belongs.

16:42.560 --> 16:43.400
In the past.

16:45.640 --> 16:46.920
We're really close.

16:48.080 --> 16:49.120
When I came here,

16:49.200 --> 16:52.520
she was really sad
and didn't want me to know.

16:53.560 --> 16:57.120
Your mom and dad must be used
to spending a lot of time without you,

16:57.200 --> 16:59.920
I imagine,
with all the competitions and all.

17:00.000 --> 17:04.000
My dad is. The truth is
we're both really independent.

17:04.600 --> 17:08.000
I grew up with my grandparents.
And I never knew my mom.

17:09.360 --> 17:12.120
I didn't know. That's sad, Steffi.

17:14.640 --> 17:16.320
Sometimes I dream about her.

17:16.920 --> 17:20.200
I dream that she's
a beautiful young woman.

17:20.840 --> 17:24.000
My grandparents told me
a lot about her. Her name was Lyn.

17:24.080 --> 17:26.440
Look. I have this picture of her.

17:32.920 --> 17:35.360
Anyway, I just had a great idea.

17:35.440 --> 17:39.160
What if I lend you my dad,
and you lend me your mom,

17:39.240 --> 17:41.280
and we do an exchange? How's that sound?

17:41.360 --> 17:43.600
-That sounds good.
-That's an awesome idea.

17:44.200 --> 17:46.400
-Ready, Steffi?
-Ready.

17:46.480 --> 17:47.400
Let's go, Luz.

18:28.160 --> 18:30.320
Great decision to go to that river, Luz.

18:30.400 --> 18:32.960
-It's true the session was awesome.
-Yeah.

18:33.040 --> 18:35.280
You look really relaxed and smooth.

18:36.160 --> 18:38.160
You won a golden cookie.

18:39.080 --> 18:40.200
A golden cookie.

18:41.000 --> 18:44.280
Augusto told me
no one's signed up in your category yet.

18:44.800 --> 18:48.120
And if there aren't any competitors,
we'll have come for nothing.

18:48.200 --> 18:50.040
No, Tony, think positive.

18:50.120 --> 18:52.320
Plus, I already have my gold medal.

18:57.840 --> 19:00.320
-Pretty picture. Can you send it to me?
-Yeah.

19:01.480 --> 19:04.600
-Done. Did you get it?
-Yeah, I just got it.

19:05.120 --> 19:10.000
@CIELOGRANDE
#SUMMERCRUSH - #TRAINING - #EPIC

19:12.320 --> 19:14.720
Hi. Sorry, do you need help?

19:14.800 --> 19:17.080
Please. Thank you so much, miss.

19:20.360 --> 19:21.200
Ready?

19:22.440 --> 19:23.640
Say "wakeboard."

19:24.400 --> 19:25.240
Wakeboard.

19:26.200 --> 19:27.040
There.

19:28.320 --> 19:30.560
I'm Luz,
Cielo Grande official photographer.

19:30.640 --> 19:32.600
A pleasure. You've got talent.

19:32.680 --> 19:33.920
Thank you.

19:34.000 --> 19:37.160
-And that's Steffi and Antonio.
-Nice to meet you.

19:37.240 --> 19:39.680
Ron Lavalle and my son, Ian.

19:42.120 --> 19:44.120
-Thank you.
-It was nothing.

20:12.920 --> 20:14.280
Luz, you have to see this.

20:15.240 --> 20:16.120
What?

20:21.440 --> 20:22.520
They're here.

20:24.320 --> 20:27.520
-What did you find?
-The missing letters for the sign.

20:27.600 --> 20:30.360
A vintage treasure.
Give me that, and I'll handle it.

20:34.920 --> 20:36.800
Will any of this still work?

20:36.880 --> 20:38.680
We'll have to try it.

20:40.160 --> 20:41.600
We've got cables.

20:42.800 --> 20:43.760
Let's see.

20:50.400 --> 20:51.720
It doesn't sound bad, huh?

20:51.800 --> 20:54.120
We could try Nati's song.

20:54.200 --> 20:55.960
-Yeah.
-It goes like this, Juli.

21:06.840 --> 21:07.920
Let's see. Sing it.

21:08.840 --> 21:09.960
<i>Now's the time</i>

21:10.680 --> 21:11.720
<i>Now it is</i>

21:14.600 --> 21:15.720
<i>Now I am</i>

21:16.800 --> 21:17.960
<i>Now I go</i>

21:18.480 --> 21:19.320
It's amazing.

21:19.400 --> 21:22.480
<i>I want to be, take a risk</i>

21:22.560 --> 21:24.360
See if you like this. Let's see.

21:31.480 --> 21:32.920
<i>Now's the time</i>

21:33.000 --> 21:34.480
<i>Now it is</i>

21:34.560 --> 21:35.960
<i>Now I am</i>

21:36.040 --> 21:37.120
<i>Now I go</i>

21:37.720 --> 21:40.640
<i>I want to be, take a risk</i>

21:43.880 --> 21:46.920
<i>There's no other way but to try</i>

21:47.000 --> 21:49.800
<i>And who knows, I could err</i>

21:49.880 --> 21:53.240
<i>Together we're so much more</i>

21:54.840 --> 21:57.960
<i>And it's true</i>

21:58.040 --> 22:00.840
<i>I don't know if it'll come out wrong</i>

22:00.920 --> 22:04.080
<i>It's true</i>

22:04.160 --> 22:07.160
<i>We have to try it</i>

22:07.240 --> 22:08.720
<i>Now's the time</i>

22:08.800 --> 22:10.240
<i>Now it is</i>

22:10.320 --> 22:11.520
<i>Now I am</i>

22:11.600 --> 22:13.440
<i>Now I go</i>

22:13.520 --> 22:17.640
<i>I already know</i>
<i>With you guys, I'll get there</i>

22:19.440 --> 22:22.520
<i>Neither win nor lose</i>

22:22.600 --> 22:25.600
<i>Our strength is trying</i>

22:25.680 --> 22:27.480
<i>It is now</i>

22:28.080 --> 22:29.280
<i>It's risking</i>

22:29.360 --> 22:32.080
<i>Embracing friendship</i>

22:32.160 --> 22:35.240
<i>It's searching, risking</i>

22:35.320 --> 22:38.440
<i>This is how we can agree</i>

22:38.520 --> 22:43.160
<i>And I know</i>
<i>With you guys, I'll get there</i>

22:44.440 --> 22:46.280
<i>I'll get there</i>

22:47.920 --> 22:50.360
Bravo! Nati, you didn't show me that part.

22:50.440 --> 22:52.240
-It just came to me.
-Awesome.

22:52.320 --> 22:53.880
Looks like we have a band.

22:54.480 --> 22:57.360
-I love the lyrics, Nati.
-Thanks.

22:59.040 --> 23:01.600
Dinner. I have to get to the bar.

23:01.680 --> 23:02.760
I'll join you.

23:08.600 --> 23:09.560
Go if you want.

23:09.640 --> 23:13.080
I'm gonna stay here a little longer,
but I'll join you guys after.

23:14.240 --> 23:15.320
Don't worry.

23:15.400 --> 23:17.920
Hunger can wait. How can I help you?

23:33.720 --> 23:34.720
Don't laugh.

23:35.440 --> 23:38.200
Even though you doubted him,
your father kept his word.

23:38.280 --> 23:40.840
Don't even say that.
They said they'd be invisible,

23:40.920 --> 23:42.480
and we've seen them everywhere.

23:42.560 --> 23:44.720
Aren't you being too hard on him?

23:45.560 --> 23:46.680
No.

23:50.120 --> 23:52.400
How are you? How was your day?

23:52.480 --> 23:53.320
Really good.

23:53.400 --> 23:55.400
Luz knows exactly where to take us.

23:55.480 --> 23:58.720
Augusto, today I published a picture
and tagged Cielo Grande,

23:58.800 --> 24:01.280
and in just two hours, I got 15,000 likes.

24:01.880 --> 24:03.080
Amazing. A success.

24:03.160 --> 24:05.760
-Yes.
-I hope it brings in some guests.

24:05.840 --> 24:07.040
-Hopefully.
-Hopefully.

24:16.480 --> 24:19.080
How can you be so stupid?
Clean that up already!

24:19.680 --> 24:20.600
Sorry.

24:22.040 --> 24:23.080
No, stop.

24:27.080 --> 24:29.280
Sorry she was so mean.
It won't happen again.

24:29.360 --> 24:30.200
-Sorry.
-Relax.

24:30.280 --> 24:33.080
Matrix, I'm Luz. Can we talk for a second?

24:33.160 --> 24:37.280
Augusto got me up to speed on everything.
We're very happy that you're here.

24:37.880 --> 24:41.480
But that lack of respect
for someone who works at Cielo Grande,

24:41.560 --> 24:42.680
we can't tolerate it.

24:42.760 --> 24:47.040
If you're gonna treat people that way,
it's gonna be hard to work together.

24:49.360 --> 24:50.680
You know, you're right.

24:51.280 --> 24:54.480
I have the signed contract right here.

25:55.640 --> 25:56.920
Okay.

25:58.760 --> 26:01.440
Ron Navarro.

26:08.360 --> 26:09.760
How interesting.

26:13.960 --> 26:16.000
Two hundred and fourteen.

26:36.240 --> 26:38.080
What are you playing at?

26:45.040 --> 26:46.480
Don't worry, Luz.

26:48.360 --> 26:50.480
Matrix can get lost with that attitude.

26:50.560 --> 26:52.440
It's impossible to work like that.

26:57.920 --> 26:58.880
Look at this photo.

27:01.560 --> 27:02.840
Do you remember that day?

27:04.600 --> 27:07.080
-It was great.
-I even remember the song.

27:08.320 --> 27:09.200
And the kiss?

27:11.640 --> 27:12.600
I panicked.

27:12.680 --> 27:15.040
What? I don't believe you.

27:15.120 --> 27:17.800
-No, you looked really confident.
-No.

27:22.880 --> 27:26.480
<i>That different day</i>

27:26.560 --> 27:28.640
<i>We saw each other</i>

27:28.720 --> 27:31.280
<i>It was urgent love</i>

27:31.360 --> 27:34.880
<i>The two of them alone, almost alone</i>

27:34.960 --> 27:38.840
<i>Our lips simply</i>

27:38.920 --> 27:40.960
<i>Time passed</i>

27:41.040 --> 27:43.160
<i>I had time</i>

27:43.240 --> 27:47.440
<i>Long wait that I lived without you</i>

27:47.520 --> 27:49.240
<i>Today I miss</i>

27:49.320 --> 27:51.080
<i>Your memory</i>

27:51.160 --> 27:55.120
<i>Which slowly is getting lost</i>

27:55.760 --> 28:00.160
<i>From your hands, your caresses</i>

28:00.240 --> 28:03.480
<i>To feel like that</i>

28:04.120 --> 28:08.080
<i>That lost sensation</i>

28:08.160 --> 28:11.840
<i>Why didn't I see it?</i>

28:12.440 --> 28:15.880
<i>Why didn't I see it?</i>

28:15.960 --> 28:19.960
<i>Love</i>

28:20.040 --> 28:23.360
<i>That's urgent</i>

28:24.040 --> 28:28.240
<i>Love</i>

28:28.320 --> 28:30.880
<i>That's urgent</i>
