36:17.006 --> 36:19.711
-lt's not my helicopter, senor.
-That doesn't matter, Bob.

36:19.800 --> 36:22.635
What we got are Ruskie spy teams
sneaking across the border.

36:22.720 --> 36:25.472
-We gotta get a look ourselves up in the air.
-But, senor--

36:25.556 --> 36:29.340
Otherwise, it's Big Macs today,
borscht tomorrow. You know what l mean?

36:29.435 --> 36:31.344
-l cannot--
-l know what you're thinking:

36:31.437 --> 36:33.311
''What are all these guys doing out here?''

36:33.397 --> 36:35.354
Good question. l only wish l had an answer.

36:35.441 --> 36:39.273
But the important thing right now is
to make sure you have your family hidden.

36:39.361 --> 36:41.899
Underground is the smartest.
Usually 20 or 30 feet.

36:41.989 --> 36:43.780
Fallout, makes your hair come out.

36:43.866 --> 36:45.906
l'm gonna get
a little personal here with you.

36:45.993 --> 36:48.698
l like you better
with a little fuzz on your noggin.

36:48.788 --> 36:50.697
ROBERTO: Underground?
MURDOCK: Nukes!

36:50.790 --> 36:53.874
And don't think it can't
happen here, Obby-bay.

36:53.959 --> 36:55.288
Let me give you a scenario.

36:55.378 --> 36:58.544
You're dancing with your honey,
and you look out to the horizon...

36:58.631 --> 37:00.173
and you see this orange glow.

37:00.257 --> 37:02.879
All of a sudden.... You are an onion ring.

37:02.968 --> 37:05.210
Look at that horizon
and look for that orange glow.

37:05.304 --> 37:07.712
You are good people. l love that!

37:13.938 --> 37:15.847
[Marching band drumbeat]

[Adventurous instrumental music]

37:29.870 --> 37:31.115
Going up!

37:41.632 --> 37:42.795
They got him?

37:42.883 --> 37:44.294
ln the car?

37:46.512 --> 37:49.299
[Suspenseful instrumental music]

37:53.769 --> 37:55.643
[Phone ringing]

37:59.442 --> 38:00.770
-Taggart.
-lt was a setup.

38:00.860 --> 38:03.267
TAGGART: What?
JONES: There was three guys and a woman.

38:03.362 --> 38:05.818
-They got the jump on Garcia and me.
-They get Prince?

38:05.906 --> 38:07.021
Yeah, they got him.

38:07.116 --> 38:09.488
l just had a feeling
we were gonna have a visit.

38:09.577 --> 38:12.412
-What are they driving?
-Prince's car. lt's gone.

38:12.496 --> 38:14.370
TAGGART: CIose that pIace up and get out.

38:14.457 --> 38:16.165
Remember, you never heard of that bar.

38:16.250 --> 38:18.492
-Right.
-And you never heard of me.

38:18.836 --> 38:21.707
Especially, buddy, you never heard of me.

38:27.136 --> 38:28.381
Cooper.

38:29.513 --> 38:32.384
Three Americans busted into Prince's place
and drug him out.

38:32.475 --> 38:34.348
l just got a call from one of our friends.

38:34.435 --> 38:37.352
TAGGART: l know. lt's your friends,
aren't they, hero?

38:37.772 --> 38:41.769
What do you think? Yours or mine?
Awful fast if it's one of yours.

38:42.943 --> 38:47.107
HANNlBAL: Get away from the gate!
Get in the back. Turn your back to the fence!

38:51.744 --> 38:54.235
[Thrilling instrumental music]

38:54.997 --> 38:56.788

[Guns firing]

39:18.938 --> 39:20.480
Everybody down!

39:44.338 --> 39:46.912
lt looks like we found it in time,
Herman, my man.

39:47.007 --> 39:49.130
Molotov cocktail hour is in session.

39:49.218 --> 39:51.970
We gonna kick some rump.
Hold onto your feelers.

[Thrilling instrumental music continues]

40:40.728 --> 40:41.973
Let's go!

40:57.203 --> 40:59.279
[Prince groaning in pain]

41:01.332 --> 41:03.075
You better have a hell of a lawyer.

41:08.089 --> 41:10.046
Hannibal! She's in here!

41:17.723 --> 41:18.802
HANNlBAL: How is she?

41:18.891 --> 41:22.225
l don't think she's gonna make it, Hannibal.
She's burning up.

41:22.311 --> 41:24.304
l'll get her to the chopper.

41:24.397 --> 41:27.351
HANNlBAL: You go with Murdock.
Take her to the hospital.

41:40.579 --> 41:41.860
[Grunting]

41:41.956 --> 41:44.079
Fool! Any more stupid ideas?

41:45.710 --> 41:47.619
[Screaming in Spanish]

42:18.617 --> 42:20.277
ls Maria's mother gonna be all right?

42:20.369 --> 42:23.204
HANNlBAL: l hope so.
l think we got her just in time.

42:23.998 --> 42:25.373
All right.

42:25.916 --> 42:27.660
Now whose plan was this?

42:27.793 --> 42:29.038
Not mine.

42:30.004 --> 42:31.332
Not mine.

42:32.006 --> 42:33.204
Then whose?

42:33.424 --> 42:34.704
Murdock.

42:36.719 --> 42:38.343
lt was Murdock's.

42:39.847 --> 42:42.385
[Amusing instrumental music]

42:43.350 --> 42:44.845
No, it wasn't.

42:52.777 --> 42:54.816
[Slow instrumental music]

43:05.039 --> 43:07.281
Sandwiches are ready, everybody.
Take your pick.

43:07.374 --> 43:09.830
We've got chicken,
peanut butter, and carrot.

43:09.919 --> 43:11.792
-Carrot?
-There you go.

43:14.382 --> 43:16.291
[Laughing nervously]

43:24.308 --> 43:25.506
HANNlBAL: Not bad.

43:25.976 --> 43:28.052
Weird. Try it.

43:32.525 --> 43:35.312
What came over the ticker on Taggart
and his merry men?

43:35.403 --> 43:38.772
We got a wire from
our El Centro Bureau this morning.

43:39.240 --> 43:42.940
Apparently a border patrol lieutenant,
Jack Taggart...

43:43.119 --> 43:45.657
and 15 of his cohorts were jailed...

43:45.913 --> 43:49.247
for transporting illegal aliens
across the border...

43:49.333 --> 43:52.500
assault, robbery, and attempted slavery.

43:52.878 --> 43:55.796
l talked to that producer friend of mine.

43:55.881 --> 43:58.419
He's gonna sponsor Maria and her mom.

43:58.509 --> 44:02.127
They'll live in his Beverly Hills mansion,
collect a nice salary...

44:02.221 --> 44:05.471
and have the rare opportunity of studying...

44:05.725 --> 44:08.394
a gigantic American ego up close.

44:08.853 --> 44:10.228
That's good, man.

44:10.312 --> 44:12.471
MURDOCK: Just a minute, Herman.

44:12.565 --> 44:15.056
l just gotta get this crease, here.

44:15.192 --> 44:19.320
What's that fool doing?
Trying to launch that bug into outer space?

44:19.905 --> 44:23.606
His work is completed here with us,
on this level of reality...

44:23.701 --> 44:26.618
and he's gotta get on.
He's needed elsewhere.

44:27.079 --> 44:30.199
B.A.: Hannibal, that fool is nuttier than ever.
MURDOCK: Perhaps.

44:30.291 --> 44:34.205
But l feel like a better man for having been
around him, even for a few days.

44:34.295 --> 44:36.418
That's very touching, Murdock.

44:36.672 --> 44:38.629
Dumb seems more like it.

44:39.633 --> 44:41.211
Where are you sending him, Murdock?

44:41.302 --> 44:42.416
MURDOCK: To a better place.

44:42.511 --> 44:45.845
To a place where, perhaps,
he'll write a new chapter...

44:45.931 --> 44:48.505
in the life of Maria and her mother.

44:48.601 --> 44:50.428
To that yacht, right over there.

44:50.519 --> 44:53.520
There's a lady bug over there,
reading a book.

44:54.106 --> 44:56.893
lt could be, who knows, Jane Austen.

45:02.323 --> 45:05.359
Goodbye, buddy. l'll never forget you.

45:05.785 --> 45:08.821
Write if you can, and if you can't, call me.

45:08.913 --> 45:12.862
Collect. But call after midnight,
'cause the rates are cheaper.

45:22.885 --> 45:26.052
MAN: Marie, there's a cockroach
in my potato salad!
