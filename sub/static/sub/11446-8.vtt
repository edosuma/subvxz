WEBVTT

00:02.127 --> 00:03.242
<i>Previously...</i>

00:03.337 --> 00:05.123
She hexed Jamie and turned him
away from me.

00:05.214 --> 00:09.458
She put an ill-wish under my bed.
And then tried to seduce my husband!

00:12.179 --> 00:15.968
Sire! This woman is
a liar and a witch.

00:16.058 --> 00:18.390
But La Dame Blanche is a white witch,

00:18.519 --> 00:21.352
and I practise white magic.

00:21.522 --> 00:24.230
And with French money,
we will unite the clans,

00:24.358 --> 00:27.521
and I will lead you all
to the gates of London.

00:27.653 --> 00:29.143
And to glory.

00:29.238 --> 00:31.070
The Prince is a canny,
slippery man, yet

00:31.198 --> 00:33.610
can fool good men
to believe he's God's chosen one.

00:33.700 --> 00:35.441
We have thwarted him all we can.

00:35.536 --> 00:38.324
We may find ourselves
staring into the abyss awaiting us

00:38.413 --> 00:39.869
at the bottom of Culloden Moor.

00:40.082 --> 00:41.322
Bring me home.

00:41.416 --> 00:43.202
- To Scotland.
- Aye.

00:45.003 --> 00:46.209
Scotland.

02:28.148 --> 02:31.812
<i>We returned to heal in the peace
of the Scottish Highlands.</i>

02:32.819 --> 02:35.811
<i>Jamie's sister, Jenny,
and her husband, Ian,</i>

02:35.947 --> 02:38.609
<i>had had another baby
while we were in Paris.</i>

02:39.660 --> 02:42.698
<i>Their welcome
and the daily routines of Lallybroch</i>

02:42.829 --> 02:45.446
<i>worked like a tonic
on our battered souls.</i>

02:48.126 --> 02:51.164
<i>We hoped we had done enough
to stop the war.</i>

02:51.963 --> 02:54.625
<i>We began planning our future,</i>

02:54.716 --> 02:57.253
<i>but as a very prescient Scot
once observed,</i>

02:57.344 --> 03:00.132
<i>the best laid schemes
of mice and men.</i>

03:00.222 --> 03:02.839
Claire, Claire! They're ready!

03:02.974 --> 03:04.760
Look how big they are!

03:04.851 --> 03:06.467
They're giant!

03:06.895 --> 03:08.806
Oh, my goodness, Rabbie.

03:08.897 --> 03:10.058
So they are.

03:10.190 --> 03:11.806
Can we eat them tonight?

03:11.900 --> 03:13.516
I don't see why not.

03:13.652 --> 03:16.189
Come on, let's go ask Mrs Crook.

03:20.492 --> 03:23.200
A grand potato, if ever I saw one.

03:23.328 --> 03:24.818
Ye've never seen one.

03:24.913 --> 03:26.074
Not in Fraser land.

03:26.206 --> 03:27.241
Not till now.

03:27.708 --> 03:29.790
Ye were right tellin' us
to plant them, Claire.

03:29.876 --> 03:31.241
<i>“Us a fine crop.</i>

03:31.378 --> 03:33.710
I dinna see how ye'd
ever grind them for parritch.

03:33.839 --> 03:36.046
I dinna believe ye grind them,
Mrs Crook.

03:36.174 --> 03:37.164
Och, aye?

03:37.259 --> 03:38.670
What do ye do with 'em, then?

03:38.760 --> 03:40.250
You boil them.

03:40.387 --> 03:42.094
- Eat them with salt.
- Aye.

03:42.222 --> 03:44.338
- Butter is good, too.
- Or roast them.

03:44.433 --> 03:45.844
Or you can mash them with milk.

03:45.934 --> 03:47.470
I dinna ken
you could cook, Sassenach.

03:47.561 --> 03:51.395
I'm not sure I can cook,
but I can certainly boil a potato.

03:51.523 --> 03:53.059
Then we shall have a feast.

03:54.860 --> 03:55.850
Ye did well.

03:55.944 --> 03:57.526
Wipe yer feet and
take off yer filthy boots

03:57.612 --> 03:59.102
before ye tramp all over this rug.

03:59.239 --> 04:00.320
Come along, lads.

04:00.407 --> 04:02.273
You can help me scrub them clean.

04:02.409 --> 04:04.491
I ran into Hector on the way up.

04:04.578 --> 04:06.410
Got the post from him.

04:08.915 --> 04:11.202
Jamie, here's one for you.

04:14.212 --> 04:15.202
Louise.

04:15.297 --> 04:16.833
It's the bill for the seed.

04:16.923 --> 04:18.959
And one from Aunt Jocasta.

04:19.091 --> 04:20.548
Good, we haven't heard
from her in months.

04:20.635 --> 04:22.000
Now, did ye get
the ploughshare fixed?

04:22.095 --> 04:24.132
Smitty says it's broken
straight through.

04:24.264 --> 04:25.595
Canna be re-forged.

04:25.724 --> 04:28.591
We'll have to hand-till
until we can get a new one.

04:28.769 --> 04:30.635
I canna believe I've become a farmer.

04:31.938 --> 04:36.603
Three French novels
and a book of poetry from Paris.

04:36.818 --> 04:38.604
Which one shall we read tonight?

04:43.074 --> 04:44.109
And what is it?

04:49.790 --> 04:52.202
"Dear cousin, so pleased.

04:52.292 --> 04:55.785
"Words cannot express my admiration
for your boldness and courage.

04:56.296 --> 04:57.502
"My prayers are with you."

05:01.510 --> 05:03.467
- Stuart Crest.
- Aye.

05:03.804 --> 05:06.762
It declares a Stuart's divine
right to the throne of Britain,

05:06.848 --> 05:10.182
supported by the chieftains
of the Highland clans,

05:10.310 --> 05:13.803
signed by those pledging
loyalty to Charles Stuart.

05:14.481 --> 05:18.145
"MacKinnon, Oliphant,
MacDonald of Glencoe.

05:21.488 --> 05:23.855
"James Alexander
Malcolm MacKenzie Fraser."

05:27.285 --> 05:30.243
Jesus bloody Christ,
he's forged your signature.

05:30.330 --> 05:32.822
Aye, he has.

05:33.291 --> 05:37.034
Charles has landed in Scotland
and is gathering his army.

05:37.170 --> 05:39.377
This was published, distributed.

05:39.506 --> 05:41.998
The names on this
are traitors to the crown.

05:43.510 --> 05:44.716
Jamie.

06:10.537 --> 06:12.699
It's all coming to pass, isn't it?

06:14.708 --> 06:18.542
Jacobite rising, Culloden,
the Clearances.

06:20.714 --> 06:22.876
The destruction of all of this.

06:23.675 --> 06:24.881
So it would seem.

06:26.386 --> 06:29.924
We could go to Ireland,
or the colonies.

06:30.056 --> 06:31.763
What of Ian and Jenny?

06:32.851 --> 06:34.888
My nieces, nephews, our cousins?

06:35.020 --> 06:36.260
We can bring them with us.

06:36.396 --> 06:37.602
All of them?

06:40.108 --> 06:41.769
What of our tenants?

06:42.736 --> 06:46.354
Leave them to
the mercy of the British butchers

06:46.448 --> 06:47.813
if the Culloden is lost?

06:47.908 --> 06:51.697
Your name on that document brands you
as a traitor to the British.

06:52.370 --> 06:54.577
And you will be hung as one
if they catch you.

06:55.415 --> 06:57.076
We can't stay.

07:02.797 --> 07:06.836
We know what will happen
if the Jacobites lose the war.

07:06.927 --> 07:08.042
But...

07:10.472 --> 07:11.928
But what if they win?

07:12.057 --> 07:13.388
They don't.

07:14.434 --> 07:16.220
It's the verdict of history.

07:16.311 --> 07:19.429
Have you given up trying to change
the future, then, Sassenach?

07:20.899 --> 07:22.481
Well, after Paris, haven't you?

07:22.609 --> 07:25.727
Aye, Paris was bitter disappointment.

07:28.990 --> 07:30.947
But you can change the future.

07:31.952 --> 07:33.659
You've proven that.

07:33.787 --> 07:36.654
Thomas Baxter lives because of you.

07:37.415 --> 07:41.625
Paris was spared an outbreak
of smallpox because of you.

07:43.755 --> 07:48.591
And Louise de Rohan
will bear Charles Stuart's bairn

07:50.136 --> 07:51.501
because of you.

07:53.306 --> 07:55.673
You want to fight for Prince Charles?

07:58.436 --> 08:02.020
Fight for our family.

08:06.695 --> 08:08.436
And for Scotland.

08:09.322 --> 08:10.938
Canna see any other way.

08:12.325 --> 08:13.611
Can you?

08:13.994 --> 08:16.201
Not one that we could live with.

08:19.332 --> 08:22.040
They say the definition of insanity

08:22.168 --> 08:25.832
is doing the same thing over and over
and expecting a different result.

08:25.964 --> 08:29.207
Well, I do not ken
who they are, Sassenach,

08:30.677 --> 08:32.293
but I'll wager,

08:34.514 --> 08:37.006
they have never
travelled through time.

08:53.366 --> 08:55.607
So, with Daniel Wallace
and Duncan MacLennan,

08:55.702 --> 08:58.114
ye should have 30 able-bodied
men from Lallybroch.

08:58.204 --> 09:01.742
Good. Murtagh, I'll need ye
to bring the men to Kingussie.

09:03.043 --> 09:06.456
Claire and I will meet you there
in two weeks,

09:06.546 --> 09:08.913
and we'll go together
to join the prince at Crieff.

09:09.340 --> 09:10.375
As ye Say-

09:10.842 --> 09:13.550
And where will we be
during these two weeks?

09:15.221 --> 09:17.212
Prince Charles has dispatched me to

09:17.348 --> 09:19.760
enlist men and support
from our kinsman,

09:19.893 --> 09:22.055
Lord Simon Fraser of Lovat.

09:23.229 --> 09:25.391
Ye're going to see Lord Lovat?

09:25.899 --> 09:27.890
Ask him to do ye a favour?

09:28.735 --> 09:31.944
Ask him to help preserve his country

09:32.072 --> 09:34.439
and restore the rightful king
to the throne.

09:34.574 --> 09:37.236
He does have a history
of supporting the Jacobites, ye ken.

09:37.368 --> 09:41.282
Aye, and the British and anyone else
that will help him line his pockets

09:41.414 --> 09:43.576
and claim the title
Chief of Clan Fraser of Lovat.

09:43.708 --> 09:46.917
A position he is entitled to
and has held for over 20 years.

09:47.754 --> 09:49.916
You're defending
the old buzzard, now?

09:50.256 --> 09:52.873
Father must be birling in his grave.

09:54.594 --> 09:56.084
Who is Lord Lovat?

09:56.221 --> 09:57.632
Our grandsire.

09:57.764 --> 10:00.222
Who we've laid eyes on
but once in our lives,

10:00.308 --> 10:02.675
when he came to visit
just after our mother died.

10:02.769 --> 10:05.181
Father threw him out before
he could cross the threshold.

10:05.271 --> 10:06.477
Why?

10:09.609 --> 10:13.068
He tried to have our mother kidnapped
and taken to the Monach Isles

10:13.154 --> 10:15.612
in order to prevent
our father from marrying her.

10:16.950 --> 10:20.488
There was some bad blood
between Lovat and the MacKenzies.

10:20.620 --> 10:22.486
A situation I assume
Prince Charles is unaware of?

10:22.622 --> 10:23.953
'Tis not only degrading

10:24.082 --> 10:25.914
for ye to crawl to that man
and ask him for help.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.707
'Tis a fool's errand.

10:27.794 --> 10:30.252
The old fox does nothing
that's not in his best interest

10:30.338 --> 10:31.794
and never without a price.

10:31.923 --> 10:32.913
No.

10:33.007 --> 10:36.921
No, what would be foolish, Janet,
would to let pride stand in the way

10:37.011 --> 10:40.003
of doing whatever I can
to save Lallybroch, Scotland,

10:40.140 --> 10:41.972
and everything that we hold dear.

10:45.979 --> 10:48.186
We'll leave for Beaufort Castle
first thing tomorrow.

10:56.614 --> 11:01.029
I havena been completely honest
with ye about my family, Sassenach.

11:01.995 --> 11:04.362
- What do you mean?
- My father...

11:06.875 --> 11:07.990
He was a bastard.

11:08.668 --> 11:11.501
Acknowledged by his father,
Lord Lovat,

11:12.213 --> 11:13.544
but a bastard nonetheless.

11:14.299 --> 11:15.664
And your grandmother?

11:16.843 --> 11:18.379
Lord Lovat's kitchen maid.

11:19.554 --> 11:22.216
She raised my father
at Beaufort Castle.

11:25.226 --> 11:27.513
I should've told ye before we wed.

11:30.690 --> 11:33.523
I'm sorry. It was cowardly of me.

11:34.861 --> 11:38.525
Jamie, you must know
your father's parentage

11:38.656 --> 11:40.192
makes no difference to me.

11:42.243 --> 11:43.574
Well,

11:44.913 --> 11:46.244
it should.

11:55.173 --> 11:56.538
It doesn't.

12:11.522 --> 12:13.388
- Let's go to bed.
- Aye.

13:49.704 --> 13:51.786
The bairn couldna sleep,

13:52.457 --> 13:54.323
and neither could Jamie.

13:54.709 --> 13:56.996
He thought they could keep
each other company for a bit

13:57.128 --> 13:58.835
while Ian and I slept.

14:00.506 --> 14:03.669
And he's trying to
get back on my good side.

14:04.510 --> 14:06.126
Did it work?

14:06.220 --> 14:07.710
It's a start.

14:12.185 --> 14:16.053
Ye can talk to a wee one in a way
you canna talk to anyone else.

14:17.023 --> 14:21.233
Ye can pour out yer heart to them
without choosing your words

14:22.695 --> 14:24.231
or holding anything back at all.

14:30.536 --> 14:32.368
And that's a comfort to the soul.

14:38.669 --> 14:41.752
It's the way we talk to them
before they're born.

14:42.382 --> 14:43.713
Ye know.

14:47.220 --> 14:48.381
Yes.

14:49.555 --> 14:50.716
I know.

14:55.228 --> 14:57.890
The man has to wait
until the child's born,

14:59.440 --> 15:01.602
and then they hold their bairn,

15:02.902 --> 15:04.688
and feel all the things that might be

15:04.779 --> 15:07.771
and all the things
that might never be,

15:07.907 --> 15:11.901
and weep, not knowing
which ones will come to pass.

15:24.882 --> 15:26.623
- Take care of your Fraser.
- Aye.

15:28.928 --> 15:30.418
And you yours.

15:32.598 --> 15:33.759
Take this.

15:33.891 --> 15:36.553
It brought Ian back to me
from France.

15:41.274 --> 15:43.891
Ye gave Ian a token when
we went to France, and no' me?

15:44.652 --> 15:47.144
And him not even your betrothed
at the time.

15:47.280 --> 15:49.112
Don't make me regret
giving it to ye now.

15:56.581 --> 15:58.743
If ye don't come back, brother,
I'll never forgive ye.

16:00.293 --> 16:03.001
Never is a very long time.

16:03.671 --> 16:04.957
I know.

16:05.089 --> 16:07.501
Just where do ye think ye're going?

16:08.801 --> 16:10.291
Well, with Milord.

16:11.971 --> 16:13.678
Ye're too young to fight, laddie.

16:13.806 --> 16:15.296
Ye'll bide here wi' us.

16:15.433 --> 16:17.800
You can help Rabbie
in the stables till Milord returns.

16:17.935 --> 16:20.597
But I belong with you.

16:21.022 --> 16:23.764
Is that not what you told me, Milady,

16:23.858 --> 16:25.644
that I will always
have a home with you?

16:26.819 --> 16:28.435
Yes, of course.

16:28.529 --> 16:29.985
- But sometimes, it's...
- He's right.

16:32.158 --> 16:34.274
His place is no' here without us,

16:36.662 --> 16:38.699
nor in France on his own.

16:40.124 --> 16:43.116
Bring him with ye, Murtagh,
when ye come with the men.

16:43.211 --> 16:44.542
Aye.

16:44.670 --> 16:46.661
If I havena killed him first.

16:47.381 --> 16:48.542
Dinna fash, Claire.

16:48.674 --> 16:50.836
We'll keep him well away
from the battle.

16:50.968 --> 16:53.835
The outcome is in yer hands, laddie.

16:54.889 --> 16:58.678
A good soldier must learn to
obey his commanding officer,

17:01.854 --> 17:03.185
as well as his general.

17:13.866 --> 17:15.321
Take care of each other.

17:16.661 --> 17:18.242
And watch out for my grandsire.

17:18.913 --> 17:20.028
I will.

17:20.873 --> 17:22.034
Bye, Jenny.

17:55.199 --> 17:57.406
<i>During our ride to Beaufort Castle,</i>

17:57.535 --> 18:00.903
<i>Jamie filled me in
on what he knew of his grandfather.</i>

18:01.539 --> 18:03.280
<i>Over the last 50 years,</i>

18:03.416 --> 18:06.750
<i>Lord Simon Fraser of Lovat
had been alternately loyal</i>

18:06.877 --> 18:08.959
<i>to both the exiled King James</i>

18:09.088 --> 18:11.796
<i>and the monarchs sitting
on the British throne.</i>

18:11.924 --> 18:14.632
<i>His personal life
was equally infamous.</i>

18:14.760 --> 18:17.878
<i>Aside from numerous
extramarital dalliances,</i>

18:17.972 --> 18:23.888
<i>Lord Lovat had had three wives, two
of them acquired by nefarious means.</i>

18:31.110 --> 18:33.101
Lord Lovat will be with you shortly.

18:41.454 --> 18:43.491
I do wish we'd had a chance
to freshen up a bit

18:43.623 --> 18:45.159
before meeting your grandfather.

18:45.291 --> 18:46.998
<i>Dmna flash, Sassenach.</i>

18:47.293 --> 18:48.749
You look bonny,

18:49.587 --> 18:54.297
though ye do have a few
teasel heads in your hair.

18:54.967 --> 18:57.129
Leave 'em. They suit her.

19:04.268 --> 19:05.554
<i>Comm.</i>

19:05.645 --> 19:07.932
I arrived this morning, myself.

19:08.022 --> 19:11.014
I saw ye enter the courtyard
from the window.

19:11.150 --> 19:13.061
What are ye doing here?

19:13.152 --> 19:17.020
Well, I'm here to discuss a response
to the rebellion with Lord Lovat,

19:17.990 --> 19:19.822
as I assume you are.

19:20.493 --> 19:21.654
War.

19:22.161 --> 19:24.528
It makes for strange bedfellows.

19:26.123 --> 19:27.784
I'm pleased to see that ye're well.

19:29.210 --> 19:32.669
You'll have to excuse me
if I find that hard to believe.

19:33.214 --> 19:35.000
The witch trial, Colum.

19:35.132 --> 19:36.588
Ye seem to be implying that I...

19:36.676 --> 19:39.338
I had something to do
with your involvement in that.

19:40.054 --> 19:41.590
It is my impression that ye were

19:41.681 --> 19:43.171
simply in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

19:43.307 --> 19:44.388
Yes, I was.

19:44.517 --> 19:47.350
Thanks to a message from
your kitchen maid, Laoghaire,

19:47.478 --> 19:50.436
who just happened to know the exact
time and place of the arrest.

19:50.523 --> 19:55.233
A gross overstepping of her place,
for which I had her beaten.

19:55.361 --> 19:58.979
I would've thrown her out of Leoch,
but her grandmother, Mrs Fitz,

19:59.073 --> 20:01.485
persuaded me she could keep
the girl in check.

20:01.575 --> 20:03.236
Is Dougal with ye?

20:03.369 --> 20:04.530
No.

20:07.039 --> 20:10.282
It became clear that
it was best for the clan

20:10.376 --> 20:13.038
that my brother remain
at his own estate.

20:13.170 --> 20:15.832
Surely Dougal would be
the one leading clan MacKenzie

20:15.923 --> 20:17.709
in fighting for King James?

20:18.217 --> 20:20.834
I'd forgotten what
a curious mind you have, lass.

20:24.181 --> 20:25.671
So the rumour is true.

20:26.684 --> 20:30.973
The grandson of
Lord Simon Fraser of Lovat

20:31.063 --> 20:33.555
has bound himself to a Sassenach.

20:34.734 --> 20:37.226
But I suppose ye are
yer father's son, after all.

20:37.361 --> 20:40.899
Who's to expect the boy
to have more sense choosing a wife

20:41.031 --> 20:43.318
than did the bastard who made him?

20:43.409 --> 20:48.370
At least I had no need to take
a wife by means of rape or trickery.

20:53.127 --> 20:55.209
No' as serious as yer father.

20:55.296 --> 20:56.536
Good.

20:57.089 --> 20:59.080
Enough breath wasted on a woman.

20:59.216 --> 21:00.251
Leave us.

21:01.093 --> 21:05.883
It's time to talk politics
with my grandson and my rival.

21:26.619 --> 21:28.656
<i>While Jamie's meeting dragged on,</i>

21:28.788 --> 21:33.123
<i>I took the opportunity to look over
the place Lord Lovat called home.</i>

21:34.794 --> 21:36.034
Mistress Fraser?

21:36.128 --> 21:39.291
I've been looking for ye
since I heard you were here.

21:42.259 --> 21:43.294
Laoghake.

21:43.427 --> 21:45.259
Did the laird not tell ye
I was with him?

21:45.346 --> 21:47.212
- No.
- My grandmother sent me along

21:47.306 --> 21:50.344
to wash his laundry
and help wherever I'm needed.

21:50.476 --> 21:52.808
I wanted to find ye,
though, because...

21:57.483 --> 21:59.190
I need to tell you.

21:59.652 --> 22:01.142
I am changed.

22:02.154 --> 22:05.818
And I am sorry beyond measure
for the horrible wrong I did to ye.

22:06.116 --> 22:07.652
My grandmother has made me see

22:07.785 --> 22:10.948
I canna be right with God
until I make amends

22:11.038 --> 22:13.655
for the pain my evil actions
have caused.

22:14.166 --> 22:18.831
I believe it is God brought us
together here so I could do so.

22:20.840 --> 22:21.875
God?

22:23.133 --> 22:24.840
You speak of God?

22:26.554 --> 22:30.923
How often have I thought about what
I would do whenever I saw you again?

22:31.016 --> 22:35.431
I have fantasized
all manner of violent acts

22:35.521 --> 22:37.011
that I would subject you to.

22:37.815 --> 22:39.180
To all of them,

22:39.900 --> 22:42.858
ending with lighting the pyre
beneath your feet

22:43.571 --> 22:47.530
and dancing on your ashes
as you promised to dance on mine.

22:53.998 --> 22:56.365
I don't hate you, Laoghaire.

23:00.045 --> 23:01.535
<i>L</i> Pit)' you.

23:03.007 --> 23:05.749
The dark places you must've inhabited

23:07.052 --> 23:10.920
in the hopes of getting something
that you'll never have.

23:15.019 --> 23:16.885
As for getting right with God,

23:18.731 --> 23:20.893
you'll just have to find another way

23:22.526 --> 23:24.517
'cause I can't help you.

23:30.951 --> 23:33.409
Maybe God did bring us together.

23:34.955 --> 23:37.447
Somehow, I... I feel lighter.

23:37.583 --> 23:40.120
Ye're more forgiving
than I am, Sassenach.

23:40.920 --> 23:43.628
I wouldna give that brazen
besom the time of day.

23:43.756 --> 23:44.962
Perhaps.

23:45.633 --> 23:48.876
So, will I be allowed
to join you at dinner tonight?

23:49.762 --> 23:50.843
Aye.

23:50.930 --> 23:52.671
Aye, my grandsire's no' opposed to

23:52.765 --> 23:54.756
a bit of decoration
at the dinner table.

23:55.768 --> 23:58.055
As long as that decoration
doesna speak.

24:01.273 --> 24:02.388
Aye.

24:03.067 --> 24:04.307
Just like that.

24:07.279 --> 24:08.440
Now, come along.

24:15.996 --> 24:18.658
Every man here knows
that to most British,

24:19.959 --> 24:22.621
all Highlanders,
no matter their allegiance,

24:23.754 --> 24:25.461
we're all the same.

24:27.091 --> 24:30.254
Savage dogs better
put down than let live.

24:31.178 --> 24:32.714
And after three uprisings,

24:32.805 --> 24:36.298
the British Army will be motivated
to put us down for good.

24:37.977 --> 24:42.642
To save our clans, our country,
our very way of life,

24:43.315 --> 24:47.479
we must band together
under the true king, King James.

24:47.611 --> 24:48.817
Fight.

24:50.489 --> 24:52.025
And we must win.

24:56.328 --> 24:59.662
We're very fortunate to have among us

24:59.790 --> 25:03.328
such a close confidant of the prince.

25:05.337 --> 25:06.702
Isn't that so, Lovat?

25:07.339 --> 25:11.298
We're lucky to have somebody
to give us an inside view

25:11.385 --> 25:13.171
of this holy rebellion.

25:13.554 --> 25:16.888
Aye, but I dinna know how holy it is.

25:20.519 --> 25:22.385
So can you tell us, then, nephew,

25:22.521 --> 25:26.310
how much support have
the French agreed to give?

25:31.030 --> 25:33.692
The French have already
supported us, Colum,

25:34.199 --> 25:37.112
by engaging the British Army
in Flanders,

25:37.202 --> 25:39.364
reducing the troops
remaining here at home.

25:47.546 --> 25:51.756
The prince is certain the French
will want to press the advantage,

25:51.884 --> 25:54.717
send men and artillery
to support the Jacobites.

25:54.845 --> 25:59.965
So the French have not yet
committed to Prince Charles?

26:00.059 --> 26:04.428
Always an unreliable ally,
the French.

26:07.107 --> 26:10.395
We will welcome the French support
when it comes, but we dinna need it.

26:18.410 --> 26:22.278
The Jacobite army is already
1,000 men strong in Crieff.

26:24.416 --> 26:29.252
MacDonalds, Camerons,
Stuarts, and Grants,

26:31.215 --> 26:32.751
and more joining every day

26:34.760 --> 26:37.092
while the majority
of the British Army

26:37.221 --> 26:39.758
remains on the continent
licking their wounds.

26:41.767 --> 26:44.350
I have heard the British
have offered £30,000

26:44.436 --> 26:46.097
for the capture of Prince Charles.

26:47.773 --> 26:49.980
Meaning what?

26:51.110 --> 26:54.944
Meaning the British
see Prince Charles as a real threat.

26:55.614 --> 26:57.480
Ye'll join us then, cousin?

26:57.616 --> 27:00.074
Perhaps the British know,
as the rest of us do,

27:00.661 --> 27:04.120
how many cullions there are amongst
the Campbells and the Camerons,

27:04.248 --> 27:07.616
men who would sell their own
grandmothers for half that amount.

27:07.751 --> 27:08.786
Aye.

27:12.131 --> 27:14.964
- Well, I...
- For £30,000,

27:15.092 --> 27:18.630
the British could end this rebellion
before it even starts.

27:18.762 --> 27:22.426
A fair sight less than it would
cost them to wage a war.

27:30.691 --> 27:32.432
I hadn't considered that.

27:33.318 --> 27:37.482
Then sit down,
ye mealy-mouthed wee smout,

27:37.614 --> 27:40.072
and dinna speak again
until ye have considered

27:40.159 --> 27:41.524
what ye're about to say.

27:43.495 --> 27:45.361
Bring us more wine,

27:47.291 --> 27:48.497
my lovely,

27:50.002 --> 27:52.460
and a glass of milk for my boy.

27:57.301 --> 27:59.508
Enough war talk tonight.

28:14.860 --> 28:17.522
You know, I got the impression
that Colum was trying to use you

28:17.654 --> 28:19.895
to convince Lord Lovat
not to join the rebellion.

28:20.032 --> 28:21.147
Aye.

28:23.368 --> 28:27.362
The first Jacobite rebellions failed,
and Colum will never support another.

28:27.497 --> 28:30.239
He wants Lovat's clan
to stay neutral with the MacKenzies,

28:30.375 --> 28:32.867
knowing that the smaller clans
will follow,

28:34.338 --> 28:37.876
and the rebellion will collapse
before it ever gets started.

28:38.008 --> 28:40.966
Well, why doesn't Colum
just speak to him directly?

28:41.053 --> 28:43.590
Because my grandsire
doesna trust my uncle.

28:46.099 --> 28:49.217
Using me is
a much more effective strategy.

28:50.062 --> 28:52.770
I need to speak to Lovat on my own,

28:52.898 --> 28:56.016
without Colum leading me
to make his arguments for him.

28:58.570 --> 29:02.154
It's a pity young Simon
is such a spineless creature.

29:02.241 --> 29:05.029
I believe he could influence
his father's decision

29:05.118 --> 29:07.359
if he took a strong stance
for our side.

29:07.454 --> 29:09.661
The man has nothing but
contempt for the poor boy.

29:11.083 --> 29:13.575
He's just trying to toughen him up,

29:13.669 --> 29:17.412
make him a viable successor
to lead Clan Fraser of Lovat.

29:23.095 --> 29:25.257
My grandsire had
the perfect opportunity

29:25.347 --> 29:28.430
to say no to us tonight,
but he didn't.

29:29.101 --> 29:31.012
Perhaps Jenny was right.

29:31.645 --> 29:35.104
He wants something in exchange.

29:42.447 --> 29:44.404
Do ye think ye can toy with me?

29:45.492 --> 29:47.904
Ye're keeping something
from me, ye old hag,

29:47.995 --> 29:50.077
and I'm no' havin' it.

30:00.465 --> 30:02.172
Are you all right?

30:03.302 --> 30:05.293
Here, let me help you.

30:07.764 --> 30:09.971
Thank you, Mistress.

30:12.019 --> 30:13.134
I'm Claire.

30:13.270 --> 30:14.681
Maisri.

30:14.813 --> 30:16.019
Lord Lovat's seer.

30:18.025 --> 30:19.106
Wait.

30:29.870 --> 30:33.829
I'll wager yer father painted
a black portrait of my character.

30:35.334 --> 30:36.790
He said very little about ye.

30:36.877 --> 30:39.164
He chose that MacKenzie whore...

30:39.296 --> 30:40.832
And I'll ask ye to
keep a civil tongue

30:40.964 --> 30:42.580
when you speak of my mother!

30:42.674 --> 30:45.132
Over me, his father, twice.

30:45.218 --> 30:46.959
First when I told him
not to marry her...

30:47.054 --> 30:48.385
And yer kidnapping attempt failed.

30:48.513 --> 30:50.675
Second time, she was dead and buried.

30:50.807 --> 30:53.299
I was willing to forgive him,
make him my successor,

30:53.393 --> 30:55.009
despite the fact he was a bastard.

30:56.563 --> 31:01.353
And he chose her memory
and that place...

31:01.485 --> 31:02.600
Lallybroch.

31:02.694 --> 31:04.025
Over me.

31:08.825 --> 31:10.156
Is it true?

31:10.369 --> 31:11.530
What?

31:12.913 --> 31:16.201
That you've no' pledged
yer fealty to Colum MacKenzie?

31:18.210 --> 31:20.042
That's what ye're after, is it?

31:23.882 --> 31:25.543
My fealty to you

31:25.675 --> 31:28.042
in exchange for sending aid
to Prince Charles?

31:30.055 --> 31:32.717
To be honest, I'm more interested
in what goes with it.

31:35.102 --> 31:37.013
What need have ye of Lallybroch?

31:37.437 --> 31:39.804
The tenants' rents would probably

31:39.898 --> 31:41.639
make no difference
to a place like this.

31:41.733 --> 31:45.897
What I do with that damnable place
would be no concern of yers.

31:46.863 --> 31:50.072
I'm yer grandsire
and head of your clan, after all.

31:50.409 --> 31:52.275
I demand my due.

31:52.702 --> 31:56.366
If I wouldna give my pledge to Colum,
who I know to be kin,

31:56.456 --> 31:59.699
then what sort of fool would I be
to give it to an old twister

31:59.793 --> 32:02.410
that may or may not share my blood?

32:03.255 --> 32:05.792
You made free with yer housemaids.

32:06.425 --> 32:08.257
Perhaps others did, too.

32:13.098 --> 32:14.588
Christ, laddie!

32:25.819 --> 32:29.778
Implying yer grandmother's
a whore to keep what you want?

32:29.906 --> 32:32.113
Ye're my kin, all right.

32:32.617 --> 32:35.154
Would that my son
had half yer mettle...

32:35.287 --> 32:38.245
I'll give ye the same pledge
I gave Colum.

32:39.124 --> 32:40.410
My help and goodwill,

32:41.126 --> 32:44.289
my obedience to yer word, so long
as my feet rest on Lovat soil.

32:44.421 --> 32:45.752
Did ye no' hear me?

32:47.799 --> 32:50.257
It's yer father's precious estate
I'm after.

32:52.637 --> 32:57.177
If ye'll no' give me Lallybroch in
exchange for men for Prince Charles,

32:59.019 --> 33:00.305
how about this?

33:02.439 --> 33:05.272
Lallybroch for yer wife's honour.

33:13.950 --> 33:15.031
Go ahead.

33:16.036 --> 33:18.323
Try to ravish my wife.

33:18.872 --> 33:21.489
And after she's done with ye,

33:21.625 --> 33:24.037
I'll send in the maid to
sweep up yer remains.

33:24.169 --> 33:28.163
Not I, lad, though I've taken
my pleasure with worse.

33:28.632 --> 33:31.124
Your grandmother comes to mind.

33:31.218 --> 33:34.210
But there are many men
in Beaufort Castle

33:34.346 --> 33:36.212
who'd be of a mind to put your

33:37.349 --> 33:38.965
Sassenach wench

33:39.518 --> 33:42.055
to the only use she's good for.

33:43.522 --> 33:45.980
Ye canna guard her night and day.

33:46.358 --> 33:47.519
No.

33:48.735 --> 33:51.978
I needn't worry, Grandsire.

33:55.075 --> 33:57.191
My wife's a rare woman.

33:58.411 --> 33:59.526
Ye ken.

33:59.913 --> 34:01.403
A wise woman.

34:04.042 --> 34:05.703
<i>La Dame Blanche.</i>

34:06.586 --> 34:08.327
"The White Lady."

34:08.755 --> 34:10.337
The Sassenach?

34:10.924 --> 34:12.255
A witch?

34:13.510 --> 34:15.717
Aye, it's true.

34:18.181 --> 34:20.263
The man that takes her
in unholy embrace

34:20.391 --> 34:23.054
will have his privates blasted,

34:24.103 --> 34:26.219
like a frostbitten apple.

34:27.732 --> 34:29.222
And his soul

34:31.027 --> 34:32.266
will

34:33.446 --> 34:34.561
burn

34:37.074 --> 34:38.735
forever in hell.

34:52.924 --> 34:54.255
Like that.

35:00.473 --> 35:03.090
<i>My grandsire has a great respect
for the supernatural.</i>

35:03.643 --> 35:05.225
No' for anything else,

35:05.312 --> 35:07.724
but ye should take care
the next few days if I'm no' here.

35:07.814 --> 35:09.976
Well, he didn't seem that frightened
of that poor woman

35:10.108 --> 35:11.940
when he tossed her
out into the corridor.

35:12.068 --> 35:13.183
Maisri's but a seer.

35:13.278 --> 35:15.645
She's not a white lady, like my wife.

35:15.780 --> 35:17.487
But she did know something
she wasna telling him.

35:18.116 --> 35:20.278
Your grandfather really is a brute,
isn't he?

35:20.410 --> 35:23.778
Aye. A brute that may soon
own my ancestral home.

35:24.956 --> 35:28.324
You can't be seriously thinking
about giving him what he wants?

35:28.460 --> 35:30.201
Well, the prince will hardly
put much stock

35:30.295 --> 35:32.286
in my abilities to lead men
or wage war

35:32.422 --> 35:33.833
if I'm not even able to persuade

35:33.965 --> 35:35.922
my own grandsire to
support our cause.

35:37.969 --> 35:39.425
Well, what about young Simon?

35:40.138 --> 35:43.631
What if we persuade him
to stand up to his father,

35:44.017 --> 35:45.849
declare his support
for the rebellion?

35:45.977 --> 35:47.092
Aye.

35:47.187 --> 35:51.351
Aye, then Lovat may send his men
if only to protect his heir,

35:52.484 --> 35:54.020
but after that scene last night,

35:54.944 --> 35:56.651
it'll take more time than we have

35:56.780 --> 36:00.193
to give the boy the confidence
he needs to truly defy his father.

36:02.494 --> 36:06.032
Perhaps it depends on what we use
to boost his confidence.

36:27.519 --> 36:29.430
Is that Jamie's shirt?

36:29.521 --> 36:31.011
I've done nothing to it.

36:33.316 --> 36:35.057
Didn't mean to imply that you had.

36:35.694 --> 36:37.526
I have changed, ye ken.

36:37.987 --> 36:40.524
I have repented
and asked God's forgiveness,

36:40.657 --> 36:42.147
and it was working.

36:42.701 --> 36:45.739
I thought he brought you both
here to help me,

36:45.870 --> 36:47.531
but it was to test me.

36:50.041 --> 36:51.702
In the great hall,
Jamie didn't even see me.

36:51.835 --> 36:53.371
'Twas like I didna exist.

36:54.879 --> 36:57.337
If ye willna avenge yerself,
ye must leave me be.

36:58.883 --> 37:01.671
Perhaps I could find
my way to forgive you.

37:02.887 --> 37:04.469
- But Jamie...
- Hail Mary, full of grace.

37:04.556 --> 37:07.264
Jamie will never love you, Laoghaire.

37:09.728 --> 37:12.766
But there might be a way
to earn his forgiveness.

37:14.274 --> 37:16.561
For him to think of you
without rancour.

37:17.402 --> 37:19.734
And why would you
want him to do that?

37:22.365 --> 37:23.947
Because we need Lord Lovat

37:24.075 --> 37:26.988
to send his men and weapons
to fight for Prince Charles,

37:27.078 --> 37:30.116
and we believe he might do this
if young Simon stood up to him

37:30.248 --> 37:31.830
and took Jamie's side.

37:31.916 --> 37:33.873
And what is that to do with me?

37:33.960 --> 37:35.792
Young Simon is infatuated with you.

37:35.920 --> 37:38.457
You could use that to
help persuade him.

37:40.091 --> 37:41.126
No.

37:41.551 --> 37:43.462
I'll not sink further
into the pit of depravity.

37:43.595 --> 37:45.211
I'll not give up
my maidenhead for you!

37:45.305 --> 37:47.797
No one is asking you to
give up anything.

37:48.725 --> 37:50.716
Besides, it's not for me.

37:50.810 --> 37:52.096
It's for Jamie.

37:54.773 --> 37:58.232
A woman has more to offer
a man than her body.

37:59.110 --> 38:03.069
When a man is in love,
he craves his beloved's approval.

38:03.490 --> 38:07.575
He wishes to please her,
and to look heroic in her eyes.

38:08.953 --> 38:12.241
And if I do whatever it is
ye have in mind,

38:12.665 --> 38:14.622
ye'll speak to Jamie on my behalf?

38:15.835 --> 38:16.950
Yes.

38:20.340 --> 38:22.331
I canna tell you
how I know, but I do.

38:23.343 --> 38:24.504
You must believe me.

38:25.345 --> 38:27.086
The only way to survive

38:28.973 --> 38:31.260
is to fight and win.

38:31.684 --> 38:33.675
And we need the weapons
and men to do so.

38:33.812 --> 38:36.474
Remaining neutral will be seen
as treason by whatever side wins.

38:36.606 --> 38:39.314
Ye know? Ye just know?

38:39.442 --> 38:40.978
Ye sound like a madman!

38:41.820 --> 38:44.312
History guides my course
in this matter.

38:44.447 --> 38:45.437
History!

38:45.532 --> 38:47.990
Not wild beliefs and
wishful thinking.

38:48.993 --> 38:50.199
The other risings,

38:50.328 --> 38:53.195
they failed because
there was no outside support,

38:53.331 --> 38:55.993
and that support does not exist now.

38:56.626 --> 38:58.833
If we do not send men to fight,

38:58.962 --> 39:01.499
this rebellion will melt away.

39:02.298 --> 39:07.543
And when that happens, we will be
left alone, as we were in the past.

39:10.390 --> 39:11.880
Lord Lovat.

39:12.892 --> 39:14.553
He would see that, too,

39:14.686 --> 39:17.269
if only the vengeful prize
of Lallybroch

39:17.355 --> 39:19.346
was not dangling
in front of his eyes.

39:19.482 --> 39:21.519
And he would agree to neutrality.

39:26.364 --> 39:29.607
Jamie, ye were always headstrong,

39:29.701 --> 39:32.489
but ye were never reckless
with the lives of others.

39:33.663 --> 39:37.577
For yer sake, and for the sake
of all you hold dear,

39:38.376 --> 39:41.084
do not make this bargain
with that man.

39:41.546 --> 39:44.914
Do not trade your home
for a war ye canna win.

39:45.592 --> 39:47.174
Will ye promise me that?

39:50.096 --> 39:51.382
I promise you, Uncle.

39:58.730 --> 40:00.266
I promise you,

40:00.398 --> 40:06.144
I will do what I must to save those
things you and I hold most dear.

40:29.260 --> 40:33.003
So nice of you to volunteer
to show me the chapel, Master Lovat.

40:33.097 --> 40:35.259
I believe it was yer idea.

40:36.225 --> 40:37.761
It's so peaceful here.

40:37.852 --> 40:39.718
Do you plan to do much
when you become laird?

40:40.438 --> 40:41.928
I've no' given it much thought.

40:43.107 --> 40:45.565
My father's still a vigourous man.

40:46.361 --> 40:48.523
Some have speculated he's immortal.

40:49.614 --> 40:54.074
And as ye may have noticed,
he doesn't have much respect for me.

40:55.620 --> 40:57.202
My husband confided in me

40:57.288 --> 41:00.371
that his father sometimes
exposed him to public scorn,

41:00.458 --> 41:02.449
to make him a better leader of men.

41:03.378 --> 41:04.584
Laoghake.

41:08.132 --> 41:09.793
I hope we're not disturbing you.

41:09.884 --> 41:10.965
No, Milady.

41:11.094 --> 41:13.051
Just collecting some
mushrooms for the cook.

41:15.223 --> 41:18.466
I'd like a few private moments
in the chapel.

41:18.601 --> 41:20.717
Do you mind waiting here for me?

41:22.981 --> 41:24.312
Well,

41:25.149 --> 41:28.642
if Mistress Laoghaire wouldn't
prefer her solitude...

41:28.778 --> 41:30.610
No, I'd welcome the company.

41:36.494 --> 41:38.280
It's a dreich day.

41:38.663 --> 41:39.824
Aye.

41:44.085 --> 41:45.575
Do you like mushrooms?

41:45.670 --> 41:47.160
Not much, no.

41:50.174 --> 41:51.414
I like poetry.

41:51.509 --> 41:52.840
So do I.

41:56.764 --> 42:01.179
"Though hurricanes rise,
and rise every wind,

42:01.310 --> 42:04.098
"they'll ne'er make a tempest
like that in my mind.

42:04.188 --> 42:08.022
"Though loudest of thunder
on louder waves roar,

42:08.818 --> 42:11.606
"that's naething like leaving
my love on the shore.

42:11.696 --> 42:13.357
-"To leave thee..."
- Perhaps you'd like to

42:13.489 --> 42:15.275
sit down on the tree.

42:47.899 --> 42:49.014
Maisri.

42:50.234 --> 42:51.816
It's Claire Fraser.

42:52.570 --> 42:54.402
We met in the corridor.

42:55.031 --> 42:57.238
Lord Lovat's tenants
do not like someone like me

42:57.325 --> 42:58.907
in the house of God.

42:59.911 --> 43:02.744
This is the only place
where my mind goes quiet.

43:02.872 --> 43:04.203
I don't know why.

43:07.251 --> 43:09.834
They say you are a "White Lady."

43:11.422 --> 43:12.912
Yes, they do say that.

43:13.716 --> 43:16.174
What brings you into a church, then?

43:17.762 --> 43:19.719
It was cold outside.

43:22.558 --> 43:25.016
I'm glad to see that
you're doing all right.

43:25.103 --> 43:27.515
Lord Lovat was so rough
with you the other day.

43:27.605 --> 43:29.892
His Lordship is not an easy master.

43:30.608 --> 43:32.019
He asks what I see

43:32.110 --> 43:34.852
and beats me when I tell him
things that displease him.

43:34.946 --> 43:39.361
Does it always come to pass,
the things that you see?

43:39.450 --> 43:40.940
Mostly, aye.

43:41.577 --> 43:45.616
Although sometimes
an action can change things.

43:46.290 --> 43:47.780
When I still lived in the village,

43:47.917 --> 43:51.535
I saw Lachlan Gibbons' daughter's man
wrapped in seaweed,

43:51.629 --> 43:54.291
and the eels stirring
beneath his shirt.

43:54.799 --> 43:56.540
I told Lachlan what I'd seen,

43:56.634 --> 44:00.548
and he went straight away
and stove a hole in the boy's boat.

44:00.638 --> 44:04.757
Lord, there was a stramash,
a right to-do.

44:05.226 --> 44:07.763
But when the great storm
came the next week,

44:08.646 --> 44:10.808
three men were drowned,

44:10.898 --> 44:14.937
and that boy was safe at home,
still mending his boat.

44:16.988 --> 44:18.149
What did you see

44:19.323 --> 44:21.735
right before Lord Lovat
threw you out?

44:21.826 --> 44:25.660
I promise,
I won't tell him that you told me.

44:29.167 --> 44:32.580
He was standing there
before the fire in his study,

44:32.670 --> 44:34.456
but it was daylight.

44:35.923 --> 44:41.839
A man stood behind him, still as
a tree, his face covered in black.

44:42.763 --> 44:47.974
And across His Lordship's face,
there fell the shadow of an axe.

44:50.521 --> 44:54.856
But if you told him,
he could change his behaviour,

44:54.984 --> 44:56.520
perhaps change the outcome.

44:56.611 --> 44:57.692
Aye.

44:58.029 --> 45:00.691
Or he mightjust kill the messenger.

45:02.533 --> 45:05.696
Mistress Claire, where are ye?

45:07.705 --> 45:08.786
Mistress Claire?

45:08.873 --> 45:10.614
I'll be right there!

45:15.630 --> 45:16.961
Where is young Simon?

45:17.048 --> 45:19.210
He ran off like a feart wee mouse.

45:19.342 --> 45:21.800
- What did you do?
- Everything ye said.

45:21.886 --> 45:22.876
I flattered him.

45:23.012 --> 45:25.128
I told him how much I admired
a man who made decisions,

45:25.223 --> 45:26.213
who thought for himself.

45:26.349 --> 45:28.716
I gave him a keek
down the front of my dress, I...

45:28.809 --> 45:30.550
I told you it wasn't about sex.

45:30.686 --> 45:32.142
No wonder he ran off.

45:32.521 --> 45:34.057
Well, other than reciting verse,

45:34.190 --> 45:37.182
he wasna doing much to hold up
his end of the conversation.

45:37.735 --> 45:39.066
I tried!

45:51.666 --> 45:52.747
Jamie?

45:53.751 --> 45:54.866
Aye.

45:56.337 --> 45:58.749
I thought I'd find you in here.

45:59.006 --> 46:03.216
More and more these days,
I think I'd prefer to be a beast.

46:05.930 --> 46:07.921
No luck with Colum, then?

46:09.267 --> 46:10.428
No.

46:11.102 --> 46:13.013
And you, with young Simon?

46:13.104 --> 46:14.185
No.

46:14.272 --> 46:16.889
I did find out what Maisri
wouldn't tell Lord Lovat, though.

46:18.359 --> 46:19.440
Aye?

46:19.527 --> 46:21.939
She saw his death at
the hands of an executioner.

46:22.029 --> 46:23.690
A traitor's death.

46:23.906 --> 46:25.613
I dinna suppose she mentioned

46:25.700 --> 46:29.364
if the executioner was in the employ
of King George or King James?

46:29.453 --> 46:31.194
No, I'm afraid not.

46:32.873 --> 46:34.580
I promised Colum

46:35.960 --> 46:39.248
I'd do what I had to,
to save the Highlanders.

46:40.464 --> 46:41.954
So I must.

46:42.049 --> 46:43.414
Jamie, it's too much.

46:44.093 --> 46:46.300
Let's just go to Prince Charles
with the men from Lallybroch.

46:46.387 --> 46:48.424
I canna go to the prince a failure.

46:49.223 --> 46:52.136
It seems I canna get the men from
Lovat without giving him my land.

46:52.226 --> 46:56.390
So, unless yer planning on declaring
yerself a visitor from the future

46:56.480 --> 46:59.643
and describing what will happen
if we dinna fight and win,

46:59.775 --> 47:01.812
then I dinna see I have much choice.

47:22.631 --> 47:27.000
I have had my secretary
prepare a neutrality pact

47:27.136 --> 47:31.425
between the Frasers of Lovat
and the MacKenzies of Leoch.

47:36.187 --> 47:42.354
I have also had him prepare a deed
of sasine for Lallybroch estate.

47:44.153 --> 47:46.440
Assigning the property to me.

47:48.616 --> 47:52.655
Sign it, and ye'll have yer men
for King James.

47:54.038 --> 47:55.528
Don't sign it,

47:55.623 --> 47:58.285
and I'll agree to neutrality
with MacKenzie here.

48:02.129 --> 48:03.836
Which will it be?

48:04.799 --> 48:08.633
Ye'll let this boy
decide the fate of Clan Lovat?

48:08.719 --> 48:10.960
He's not even yer recognised heir.

48:11.055 --> 48:13.137
I have made this decision.

48:13.224 --> 48:16.057
The boy is but an obstacle in my way.

48:17.728 --> 48:21.062
What will it be, obstacle?

48:21.148 --> 48:22.684
Dinna be a fool, Jamie.

48:34.745 --> 48:40.161
I do this to ensure the future
of my family and people.

48:56.058 --> 48:57.844
What are ye staring at?

48:57.935 --> 48:58.925
Claire?

49:03.399 --> 49:04.434
No!

49:05.776 --> 49:07.107
It's another vision.

49:08.612 --> 49:10.194
- Claire.
- Leave her be!

49:10.281 --> 49:12.272
Do no' give me orders
about my own wife!

49:12.408 --> 49:14.024
Claire! Claire, Claire.

49:15.035 --> 49:16.446
What did she see?

49:16.579 --> 49:18.786
- Jamie!
- What did ye see, witch?

49:18.914 --> 49:19.949
Stay back!

49:20.082 --> 49:21.117
Lovat

49:21.208 --> 49:23.700
Can you not see this
for the pretence that it is?

49:23.794 --> 49:24.909
Pretence?

49:25.296 --> 49:27.958
You know that
she was tried as a witch

49:28.090 --> 49:30.798
by those that dinna understand
the difference between black magic

49:32.219 --> 49:33.755
and the power of the old ones.

49:36.098 --> 49:38.465
What did she see?

49:38.601 --> 49:40.968
You don't need to answer him, Claire.

49:41.061 --> 49:43.644
She will if she wants
to walk out of this room.

49:46.984 --> 49:50.102
No, it's all right, Jamie.

49:58.496 --> 50:01.909
I saw you

50:03.751 --> 50:06.994
standing in bright sunlight.

50:09.173 --> 50:11.335
There was a man behind you.

50:13.177 --> 50:15.544
He was wearing a black hood,

50:16.805 --> 50:19.843
shadow of an axe across your face!

50:21.936 --> 50:23.301
Whose man?

50:24.063 --> 50:25.303
Whose executioner?

50:26.774 --> 50:30.142
King James or King George?

50:32.446 --> 50:34.062
I... I don't remember.

50:38.994 --> 50:40.450
The ground

50:41.789 --> 50:44.451
was covered in white roses.

50:44.833 --> 50:47.040
The symbol of the Jacobites!

50:47.127 --> 50:48.162
No, no.

50:50.256 --> 50:52.463
Witch! I'll cut out yer tongue!

51:01.308 --> 51:04.346
How dare you thwart me, boy.

51:10.150 --> 51:12.983
You and MacKenzie
are fearful old men.

51:14.738 --> 51:16.445
And you're wrong.

51:17.283 --> 51:19.069
My cousin is right.

51:19.577 --> 51:23.696
It's our duty to stand up
for our country and our kinsmen.

51:25.583 --> 51:27.415
I will fight for King James.

51:28.794 --> 51:31.582
I will fight to change
the White Lady's vision

51:33.924 --> 51:35.585
even if ye will not.

52:02.745 --> 52:04.235
The Frasers of Lovat

52:08.667 --> 52:11.159
will stand with
the MacKenzies of Leoch.

52:12.046 --> 52:15.164
We will remain neutral in the war.

52:27.394 --> 52:29.351
I wish ye luck, my boy.

52:30.272 --> 52:34.641
Come, MacKenzie, let's drink
to our newly formed alliance.

52:57.716 --> 52:58.877
I'm ready.

53:00.469 --> 53:01.925
Ye did well, young Simon.

53:02.012 --> 53:03.923
I'm proud to be yer kinsman.

53:04.014 --> 53:05.925
And I'll be proud to
fight by yer side.

53:06.975 --> 53:08.386
I'll wait for ye outside the gate.

53:08.477 --> 53:09.638
Aye.

53:10.270 --> 53:11.681
So we go to the prince empty-handed.

53:11.772 --> 53:13.729
But at least we were able
to save Lallybroch.

53:14.483 --> 53:15.598
Aye.

53:32.209 --> 53:34.371
Go back to yer home and yer family.

53:34.461 --> 53:36.998
I told you, Uncle, I canna do that.

53:39.633 --> 53:43.547
Can you not convince him
to listen to reason and go home?

53:44.471 --> 53:46.587
You've known him longer than I have.

53:46.682 --> 53:48.013
What do you think?

53:48.100 --> 53:50.933
I think it's a blessing
that his mother didn't live

53:51.019 --> 53:53.477
to see what a reckless fool
she spawned.

53:58.652 --> 54:00.234
Give me your hand.

54:35.314 --> 54:36.770
We must away as well, Claire.

54:36.857 --> 54:39.849
I need to be in Kingussie
by the end of the week.

54:39.943 --> 54:41.104
Wait.

54:41.779 --> 54:44.862
Before we go, there's something
that I need you to do for me.

54:44.948 --> 54:45.983
Aye.

54:46.492 --> 54:48.608
Say thank you to Laoghaire.

54:49.286 --> 54:50.447
"Thank you"?

54:52.581 --> 54:53.787
For what?

54:53.874 --> 54:56.161
Not trying to have you
arrested in the last few days?

54:56.710 --> 54:59.247
Please. Do it for me.

54:59.338 --> 55:01.045
I'll explain it all later.

55:02.674 --> 55:03.789
Aye.

55:15.687 --> 55:16.768
L.-

55:21.109 --> 55:23.146
I'm told to thank ye.

55:26.156 --> 55:28.488
For what, I dinna ken, but...

55:30.202 --> 55:31.784
Thank you, Laoghaire.

55:33.413 --> 55:36.496
I hope one day I can also
earn yer forgiveness, Jamie.

55:40.546 --> 55:42.036
And yer love.

55:45.342 --> 55:46.377
Let's go.

56:29.678 --> 56:30.884
Who are they?

56:35.893 --> 56:37.554
My father's men.

56:38.979 --> 56:41.220
Come on.

56:41.315 --> 56:43.306
Go. Go on. Come.

56:49.364 --> 56:52.322
<i>Don't sit there</i> gaping <i>at me,
ye glaiket sumph!</i>

56:52.409 --> 56:53.444
Go see to yer men!

57:00.667 --> 57:02.328
Turning that one into a soldier

57:02.419 --> 57:05.002
will be a greater feat
than beating the British.

57:06.465 --> 57:09.674
What vision do ye have
for me now, White Lady?

57:10.552 --> 57:12.134
I don't understand.

57:12.220 --> 57:15.804
Now it will seem my grandsire
has sent his heir to fight.

57:16.600 --> 57:18.386
The Stuarts will credit Lovat with

57:18.477 --> 57:20.718
supporting King James,
should they win.

57:20.812 --> 57:23.179
They canna execute me for treason.

57:24.274 --> 57:26.265
But what about
the neutrality agreement?

57:26.360 --> 57:28.692
I trust old Colum MacKenzie is right.

57:29.071 --> 57:31.984
And that will protect me
if the British should win.

57:32.074 --> 57:34.657
What will you say about your son
fighting for the Jacobites?

57:34.743 --> 57:36.029
He's his own man, that one.

57:36.119 --> 57:37.701
Ye saw it yourself last night.

57:37.788 --> 57:39.779
Persuaded others to follow.

57:41.792 --> 57:43.999
I thank ye, White Lady.

57:44.086 --> 57:46.453
I couldna have got it all without ye.

57:46.546 --> 57:47.832
Ye didna get Lallybroch.

57:48.966 --> 57:51.333
Not yet. Aye. Come on!

57:53.428 --> 57:57.387
Please, tell me
I'm nothing like him, Sassenach.

57:57.975 --> 58:01.343
I'm afraid I have seen
a similarly devious turn of mind.

58:02.270 --> 58:05.262
I might have to rethink our agreement
not to lie to one another.

58:11.863 --> 58:16.232
<i>As we put distance between ourselves
and Jamie's loathsome grandfather,</i>

58:16.326 --> 58:17.737
<i>my heart lightened.</i>

58:19.496 --> 58:21.328
<i>We had L0vat's men now.</i>

58:21.415 --> 58:23.827
<i>Jamie would have the prince's favour</i>

58:23.917 --> 58:28.081
<i>and at least the opportunity
to steer the rebellion to victory.</i>

58:28.171 --> 58:31.254
<i>Maisri had said
we could change the future.</i>

58:31.591 --> 58:33.582
<i>Perhaps we already had.</i>
