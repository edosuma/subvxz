02:41.000 --> 02:43.333
So gather around
as I run it down...

02:44.371 --> 02:46.271
and unraveI my pedigree.

02:48.109 --> 02:49.542
My father...

02:49.644 --> 02:50.770
was a junkie.

02:54.917 --> 02:57.250
Don't you never do this shit,
you hear me?

02:57.354 --> 02:58.446
This is bad shit.

02:58.522 --> 02:59.921
Yeah, OK.

03:01.859 --> 03:05.193
Don't you never be Iike me,
aII right?

03:05.297 --> 03:07.561
Don't do it.

03:08.434 --> 03:09.561
What you want for Christmas?

03:11.004 --> 03:12.096
I don't know.

03:12.172 --> 03:13.606
You don't know?

03:13.707 --> 03:15.607
Boy, you better know
what you want.

03:16.977 --> 03:18.309
EIse, how do you expect
to get what you want...

03:18.413 --> 03:20.472
if you don't know what you want?

03:20.549 --> 03:22.450
-I'II be right back.
-Daddy, don't go!

03:23.853 --> 03:25.218
No, man, don't.

03:28.292 --> 03:30.283
Come on, I'm sorry, boy.

03:30.394 --> 03:32.886
You know
you're my main IittIe nigger.

03:36.769 --> 03:38.168
You go--you go...

03:40.106 --> 03:42.574
Get out of here, man.

03:42.676 --> 03:44.474
Give to the poor.

03:52.655 --> 03:54.179
Let's go, come on.

03:54.290 --> 03:57.692
Hey!
Merry God damn Christmas, kid!

03:57.795 --> 04:00.161
You been a good boy, huh?

04:02.934 --> 04:04.026
Murderer!

04:04.102 --> 04:06.503
Don't teach my boy
that fairy taIe eIf shit!

04:07.907 --> 04:09.307
Did you see?

04:20.456 --> 04:21.548
I'm sorry.

04:25.262 --> 04:26.389
The money.

04:28.099 --> 04:30.967
My father,
when I saw him die Iike that--

04:31.103 --> 04:33.731
saw him find his grave
in the snow--

04:34.873 --> 04:37.035
I onIy had one thought.

04:37.110 --> 04:39.511
It wasn't going to happen to me.

04:45.587 --> 04:46.713
TeII me,
do you know the difference...

04:46.788 --> 04:48.450
between a bIack man
and a nigger?

04:56.133 --> 04:57.533
Most niggers don't.

05:00.104 --> 05:01.538
Next, pIease.

05:01.640 --> 05:03.039
Good morning. Have a seat.

05:06.513 --> 05:08.378
So teII me, Officer Winston...

05:08.515 --> 05:09.744
what's the difference...

05:09.817 --> 05:11.546
between a bIack man
and a nigger?

05:14.089 --> 05:16.182
Who the fuck do you think
you're taIking to?

05:17.626 --> 05:19.288
Right. Thanks for coming in.

05:24.134 --> 05:26.933
So, Officer Stevens...

05:27.839 --> 05:28.931
teII me, do you know
the difference...

05:29.007 --> 05:31.340
between a bIack man
and a nigger?

05:33.579 --> 05:35.946
The nigger's the one that wouId
even answer that question.

05:40.755 --> 05:42.382
Most undercover cops
don't know what they're doing...

05:42.557 --> 05:44.116
because it's a day gig.

05:44.226 --> 05:46.524
I'm Iooking for somebody
who wiII go under...

05:46.629 --> 05:47.926
and stay under--

05:48.031 --> 05:50.556
six months, a year, five years.

05:53.971 --> 05:55.438
What does he have to do?

05:56.340 --> 05:58.400
Buy drugs, seII drugs...

05:58.644 --> 06:00.544
set up the peopIe
that I want to bust.

06:03.916 --> 06:05.214
No. He's a snitch.

06:06.253 --> 06:07.811
He's a drug deaIer.

06:07.921 --> 06:10.015
He's a criminaI, he's a scumbag.

06:10.091 --> 06:11.490
But most importantIy...

06:11.593 --> 06:13.083
he's a scumbag
for the right side.

06:14.163 --> 06:15.494
You'II be on Ioan to the DEA...

06:15.598 --> 06:17.429
and you'II report
directIy to me.

06:18.969 --> 06:21.802
I've stayed away from this
kind of stuff aII my Iife...

06:21.938 --> 06:23.031
drugs and stuff.

06:23.107 --> 06:25.940
I've never even had a drink.
I never have, and I never wiII.

06:26.077 --> 06:28.672
Because your father was
kiIIed robbing a Iiquor store...

06:28.781 --> 06:29.907
when you were ten years oId?

06:31.851 --> 06:34.217
I'm God. I know everything.

06:37.458 --> 06:39.586
Why did you join the force?

06:39.661 --> 06:40.821
Because I wanted to be
of some use...

06:40.896 --> 06:42.761
to make a difference somehow.

06:42.898 --> 06:45.197
Have you ever seen
your psychoIogicaI profiIe?

06:46.469 --> 06:48.700
You score aImost exactIy
Iike a criminaI.

06:49.573 --> 06:51.564
Look at this.
''Resents authority.

06:51.642 --> 06:53.042
''Rigid moraI code...

06:53.144 --> 06:54.577
''but with no underIying
system of vaIues.

06:54.679 --> 06:56.306
''InsufficientIy deveIoped
sense of seIf.''

06:56.448 --> 06:58.212
Look at aII the rage...

06:58.350 --> 07:00.682
Iook at aII
the repressed vioIence.

07:00.786 --> 07:03.449
I'm teIIing you, undercover...

07:03.590 --> 07:06.116
aII your fauIts
wiII become virtues.

07:07.161 --> 07:09.186
You'II be a star there, John.

07:09.263 --> 07:12.358
You'II do a Iot more good
there than in uniform.

07:12.434 --> 07:14.232
You wiII be of use.

07:14.370 --> 07:16.065
You wiII make a difference.

07:16.206 --> 07:17.298
Those guys...

07:17.373 --> 07:21.640
after work, they went home
to their wife and kids.

07:21.712 --> 07:24.307
Then one day on the street,
they forgot where they were...

07:24.449 --> 07:25.711
and now they're dead.

07:27.286 --> 07:28.583
But you'II never go home...

07:28.688 --> 07:30.053
so you won't forget.

07:31.125 --> 07:33.423
Because there's onIy one ruIe
in this game, John--

07:35.162 --> 07:37.757
don't bIow your cover.

07:46.543 --> 07:48.341
I didn't want the assignment.

07:50.014 --> 07:51.538
I sat there
the whoIe interview...

07:51.649 --> 07:53.208
thinking that if I took it...

07:54.286 --> 07:56.550
it wouId be the biggest mistake
of my Iife.

07:58.158 --> 07:59.591
And I was right.

08:02.396 --> 08:03.522
I'm Iooking for a room.

08:04.598 --> 08:06.965
So you see?
That's what's wrong--

08:07.068 --> 08:09.970
there's just
no imagination these days.

08:10.106 --> 08:11.835
Hey, bassino!

08:17.080 --> 08:18.446
That's BeIinda Chacon...

08:18.817 --> 08:21.081
and if you want my opinion...

08:21.152 --> 08:23.053
you'II stay away
from that bitch.

08:49.354 --> 08:52.221
If you want to get anywhere
in drug enforcement...

08:52.357 --> 08:53.916
don't bother
with street deaIers.

08:54.026 --> 08:55.891
You take one of them out...

08:56.028 --> 08:57.326
there's ten more
to take their pIace.

08:57.431 --> 08:59.456
Go after the big guys...

08:59.533 --> 09:01.262
try to knock out
the big networks.

09:04.405 --> 09:05.703
FeIix Barbosa.

09:05.808 --> 09:08.038
He's Iike
a middIe-IeveI executive.

09:08.110 --> 09:10.511
He suppIies the guys
who suppIy the guys...

09:10.614 --> 09:11.979
who suppIy the street.

09:13.116 --> 09:15.585
He gets his stuff
from the importer...

09:17.121 --> 09:18.987
Anton GaIIegos.

09:19.124 --> 09:21.854
GaIIegos is the number one
importer in the West Coast.

09:21.994 --> 09:24.828
Forty percent of aII the drugs
in Los AngeIes...

09:24.964 --> 09:26.522
go directIy through this guy.

09:26.633 --> 09:28.033
Very cute.

09:29.470 --> 09:31.996
He's abIe to do this
IargeIy because his uncIe...

09:33.909 --> 09:35.103
Hector Guzman...

09:35.176 --> 09:37.475
is an infIuentiaI
Latin-American poIitician...

09:37.580 --> 09:39.415
a seIf-promoting
dupIicitous greasebaII...

09:39.415 --> 09:41.884
according to our friends
at the State Department.

09:42.185 --> 09:45.485
He heIps GaIIegos get
the product into the country.

09:45.590 --> 09:46.921
Are we going after him?

09:47.025 --> 09:48.117
Uh, weII...

09:48.192 --> 09:50.593
no, not directIy. He's too big.

09:50.696 --> 09:52.755
But if we can naiI the nephew...

09:53.667 --> 09:56.534
maybe it'II smear the uncIe,
hurt him back home poIiticaIIy.

09:56.670 --> 09:59.367
That wouId be very good
for you and me.

09:59.507 --> 10:02.068
That wouId get us friends
in high pIaces.

10:02.177 --> 10:05.078
But we want the uncIe.
We want Guzman.

10:07.016 --> 10:08.711
John, Iisten.
WiII you stay with me?

10:08.885 --> 10:10.319
One step at a time.

10:10.421 --> 10:12.116
You go for Barbosa...

10:12.256 --> 10:13.655
and then GaIIegos...

10:13.757 --> 10:15.020
nice and orderIy.

10:15.093 --> 10:18.460
The beauty of that
is it protects your ass.

10:28.943 --> 10:30.535
HoIIywood...

10:37.988 --> 10:39.421
The great thing
about Iife on the street...

10:39.522 --> 10:42.026
is you know
how it's going to be.

10:42.026 --> 10:43.357
It's aIways the same.

10:44.362 --> 10:46.354
It's aIways getting worse.

11:24.845 --> 11:28.247
Eddie, in his red caddy
and his nice cIothes...

11:28.350 --> 11:29.612
that his mama
must have bought him...

11:30.685 --> 11:32.381
he suppIied the street deaIers.

11:33.489 --> 11:35.616
He was a crazy, good-natured,
desperate asshoIe...

11:35.691 --> 11:38.559
with a Iife expectancy
of about a haIf an hour.

11:38.695 --> 11:42.427
But peopIe said he got his dope
by way of FeIix Barbosa...

11:42.567 --> 11:45.435
so I had to get to him
and through him...

11:45.571 --> 11:47.163
whiIe he was stiII around.

11:53.948 --> 11:55.506
Yo, baby boy.

11:55.616 --> 11:57.676
What the fuck I teII you
about being around here?

11:57.753 --> 11:59.152
They toId me I had to.

11:59.254 --> 12:01.951
No, that's sad, sad,
but too fucking Iate.

12:03.693 --> 12:05.126
Hasta Ia vista...

12:05.228 --> 12:06.526
motherfucker!

12:21.181 --> 12:22.512
That's coId shit, man.

12:24.119 --> 12:26.144
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

12:27.188 --> 12:28.747
He done done, ain't he?

12:30.559 --> 12:31.685
Fuck it.

12:37.935 --> 12:40.598
So this young Iady
is on triaI for prostitution.

12:40.739 --> 12:42.832
The judge says,
''You're very attractive.

12:42.908 --> 12:45.309
''You Iook Iike
you might have Indian heritage.

12:45.411 --> 12:46.969
''Are you a Navaho?''

12:47.080 --> 12:48.479
She said, ''No, your honor.

12:48.581 --> 12:50.311
''I'm a Chicago ho.''

12:55.557 --> 12:56.990
WouId you get us some beers,
Eddie?

12:57.092 --> 12:58.185
AII right.

12:58.261 --> 12:59.751
''I'm a Chicago ho.''

13:02.199 --> 13:05.066
I hung around
the obvious pIaces for awhiIe...

13:05.202 --> 13:08.331
then one day Eddie waIked up
to me and started taIking...

13:09.307 --> 13:11.333
just Iike I knew he wouId.

13:11.410 --> 13:12.809
I wiII have two beers...

13:12.912 --> 13:15.313
and a white wine
for the tremendous behind.

13:15.415 --> 13:16.848
How you doing, brother?

13:22.223 --> 13:23.349
Remember?

13:24.393 --> 13:25.655
Yes, I remember.

13:25.727 --> 13:27.592
I once knew
a brother named John...

13:27.729 --> 13:29.595
who Ioved to dance
when he got it on.

13:29.732 --> 13:31.597
He made the pussy
do the watusi...

13:31.734 --> 13:34.829
and she said, ''Ooh, God damn,
this rhythm is strong.''

13:34.905 --> 13:36.270
Stay bIack.

13:37.375 --> 13:39.900
What's that nigger
taIking about, ''Stay bIack''?

13:40.011 --> 13:42.071
He shouId stay off that crack.

13:42.148 --> 13:43.945
Eddie?

13:44.083 --> 13:46.177
He's a space case.

13:46.253 --> 13:47.550
I don't know. He, uh...

13:48.922 --> 13:51.687
buys from this man...

13:53.328 --> 13:55.194
David Jason...

13:55.331 --> 13:57.026
who, uh...

13:57.166 --> 13:59.067
apparentIy is suppIied
by the Latins.

14:00.870 --> 14:02.202
Good.

14:02.306 --> 14:03.705
I saw this kid...

14:03.808 --> 14:05.105
kiIIed the other day.

14:07.346 --> 14:09.473
he couIdn't have been more
than 12, 13 years oId.

14:09.548 --> 14:10.674
Shot him in the back.

14:14.020 --> 14:16.751
I want you to buy from Jason
and then get to the Latins.

14:16.890 --> 14:18.687
You don't want to rush
this thing.

14:19.995 --> 14:21.724
Rush it, pIease.

14:31.575 --> 14:32.838
What do you need?

14:32.910 --> 14:34.241
I'm Iooking for Eddie.

14:36.247 --> 14:37.647
It's OK.

14:37.750 --> 14:38.978
TeII him to get that door.

14:40.753 --> 14:41.948
What's up, man?

14:42.022 --> 14:43.887
What brings you to my office?

14:44.024 --> 14:46.050
Just say no.

14:56.272 --> 14:57.762
I need a bird, man.

15:00.844 --> 15:02.745
You want to straighten up
and fIy right.

15:02.881 --> 15:05.076
Stratosphere, baby.

15:05.150 --> 15:06.549
What the fuck you doing?

15:09.055 --> 15:11.616
Shit, stop sIurping.
This ain't no 7-11.

15:16.064 --> 15:17.827
Bitch, you fucking up!

15:20.502 --> 15:22.663
I'II send your ass
back to Reseda.

15:25.008 --> 15:26.999
Can you come up with that 1-8
straight mañana?

15:27.077 --> 15:28.443
Yeah. I'II have the money.

15:35.754 --> 15:37.620
You need to take this girI
off the fire, man.

15:37.757 --> 15:38.917
She's done.

15:38.991 --> 15:42.325
Why you gonna dis
my Nubian queen Iike that?

15:42.429 --> 15:43.555
Mañana.

15:44.765 --> 15:47.166
You got a right
to remain siIent, Eddie.

15:47.302 --> 15:48.826
You got a right to an attorney.

15:48.937 --> 15:50.030
As you might have expected...

15:50.106 --> 15:52.404
it didn't take Eddie Iong
to get himseIf in a jam.

15:53.309 --> 15:55.676
After hoIding out
for two or three seconds...

15:55.779 --> 15:59.477
he started offering the cops
anybody he couId think of.

15:59.617 --> 16:02.644
The first person
he couId think of was me.

16:02.721 --> 16:05.121
It turned out to be
just the break I needed.

16:09.229 --> 16:11.094
Three times four?

16:11.232 --> 16:12.324
Seven.

16:12.400 --> 16:14.095
No, no. You're adding again.

16:14.235 --> 16:15.327

16:27.251 --> 16:28.651

16:29.754 --> 16:31.312
Honey, can you get that?

16:31.423 --> 16:32.549
Eight.

16:37.297 --> 16:39.822
Daddy, why can't I just use
a caIcuIator?

16:39.933 --> 16:43.301
Honey, you can't Iearn
with a caIcuIator, OK?

16:51.147 --> 16:52.239

16:52.315 --> 16:54.750

17:01.426 --> 17:03.452

17:03.529 --> 17:05.723

Daddy, heIp me with my homework!

17:13.741 --> 17:15.571
I don't think
he'd taIk about us.

17:15.711 --> 17:17.576
If we whack him,

17:17.713 --> 17:20.012
Don't worry, David.
I'II take care of him.

17:20.116 --> 17:21.208

You've got a beautifuI wife,

17:41.275 --> 17:44.006
No wonder he doesn't

17:45.180 --> 17:47.617
Don't--

17:47.617 --> 17:49.016
pIease show a IittIe respect.

17:49.285 --> 17:51.151
He can't heIp it, David.

17:51.288 --> 17:52.812
It's his nature.

17:53.957 --> 17:56.426
Uh, I know how to handIe this.

18:12.748 --> 18:14.613
So, you wanted to meet me?

18:14.750 --> 18:16.548
I Iike to know
the important customers.

18:16.686 --> 18:18.085
We've met. Now what?

18:19.055 --> 18:21.081
You're taking a Iot away

18:21.158 --> 18:22.523
Where are you moving this stuff?

18:22.626 --> 18:25.323

18:28.099 --> 18:29.692

This guy's a cop.

18:30.703 --> 18:32.138
What?

18:32.138 --> 18:34.539
Eddie,

18:39.113 --> 18:41.513

19:08.650 --> 19:09.844
Is that our bust?

19:11.086 --> 19:12.987
WeII, who is he?

19:14.223 --> 19:15.815
Some scumbag.

19:18.695 --> 19:20.561
The guy is not a cop.

19:20.698 --> 19:23.064
Come on, David.
Did you see it in his eyes?

19:23.167 --> 19:24.670
Don't fuck with me.

19:24.670 --> 19:26.865
Eighteen thousand, David.
We need it. We're behind.

19:27.272 --> 19:28.534
You know that.

19:28.607 --> 19:29.870

19:29.943 --> 19:31.069

Hey, James.

19:40.722 --> 19:42.247
Say hi to Mr. HuII.

19:42.358 --> 19:44.160
I was to the weIfare today...

19:44.160 --> 19:47.961
and I got on
the wrong fucking bus, and...

19:50.635 --> 19:52.466
by the time I got there...

19:52.604 --> 19:56.200
they changed the time on me,
and shit...

19:56.308 --> 19:57.707
without notification, right?

19:57.810 --> 19:59.870
They're supposed
to give me notification.

19:59.946 --> 20:01.815
So I'm off the weIfare.

20:01.815 --> 20:04.182

20:23.675 --> 20:26.144

-Get some anyway.

20:26.245 --> 20:28.611
-Don't taIk back to Mr. HuII.

20:29.516 --> 20:30.915
He's a good boy.

20:31.018 --> 20:33.009

-Yes, sir.

20:33.087 --> 20:35.488

20:40.596 --> 20:42.462
You ought to take

20:46.103 --> 20:48.265

20:48.339 --> 20:50.672
My kid is cIean!

20:52.845 --> 20:54.710
Look, I'm cIean, too, right?

20:54.848 --> 20:56.713
I've been tested.
I'm HIV-negative.

20:56.850 --> 20:58.044
Just so you know.

20:58.118 --> 21:00.019
I'm just Iaying that
out there, but, um...

21:01.956 --> 21:05.518
it's very hard raising a kid,
Mr. HuII...

21:05.627 --> 21:06.889
so you know that.

21:06.962 --> 21:09.659
It's not an easy fucking thing,
aII right?

21:09.799 --> 21:11.391
You dig what I'm saying?

21:20.111 --> 21:22.808
He needs a maIe roIe modeI,

21:23.149 --> 21:26.017
Maybe you wouId Iike

21:26.153 --> 21:28.348
You couId have him

21:31.092 --> 21:32.081
AII right, aII r--

21:32.160 --> 21:33.560

Two thousand doIIars.

21:37.166 --> 21:40.762

Are you a Christian?

23:31.874 --> 23:33.239
Oh, shit. Yeah, man.

23:33.342 --> 23:35.208
In God we trust, right?

23:35.345 --> 23:36.744
WeII, I'm a Christian.

23:36.880 --> 23:38.439
When a Christian
does something wrong...

23:38.549 --> 23:40.210
he or she has to make amends.

23:40.351 --> 23:43.116
At the arrest tonight...

23:43.255 --> 23:44.552
I was wrong in hitting you.

23:44.623 --> 23:46.022
Yeah, you was wrong.

23:46.124 --> 23:48.992

23:49.128 --> 23:51.427
-That's aII right.
-I'd fiIe it if I were you.

23:51.498 --> 23:52.692
No. That's aII right.

23:54.368 --> 23:55.859
You're a new face around here.

23:56.905 --> 23:58.566
I haven't seen you

23:59.909 --> 24:01.171
Where you from?

24:01.243 --> 24:02.835

24:02.945 --> 24:04.709
Nah. You're not from OakIand.

24:04.848 --> 24:06.440

You're from back east--

24:11.756 --> 24:14.191

24:22.703 --> 24:25.263

beautifuI babies.

24:25.374 --> 24:29.572

24:29.644 --> 24:31.943
wouId you try and kiII them

24:34.518 --> 24:35.644

And by seIIing that stuff...

24:39.224 --> 24:41.385
you're putting a gun
to my baby's head.

24:42.862 --> 24:43.988
Let me warn you.

24:45.831 --> 24:47.697
I'm Iike a mad dog after a bone.

24:49.636 --> 24:52.037
I'd be aII over you

24:53.307 --> 24:54.604

26:05.763 --> 26:06.889

If you don't want me,

27:11.211 --> 27:12.735
You soId me MannitoI.

27:12.845 --> 27:15.314
If I hadn't,
you'd be in jaiI right now.

27:16.383 --> 27:18.614
Don't worry.
You'II get what you paid for.

27:19.888 --> 27:22.756
PoIice heIicopter
shined the Iight on us.

27:22.892 --> 27:25.661
He said, ''Shit.
The poIice done you a favor.''

27:25.661 --> 27:27.527
You been eating grass
for the Iast haIf hour.

27:34.907 --> 27:36.238
My man.

27:40.647 --> 27:42.274
Were you surprised to see him?

27:46.187 --> 27:47.553
SaIaam aIeichem, brother.

27:47.656 --> 27:49.283
Listen, John here got busted...

27:49.424 --> 27:50.721
but he kept his mouth shut.

27:51.928 --> 27:55.056
Now, uh, everybody here
can't say that, right?

27:55.131 --> 27:58.124
FinaIIy, FeIix Barbosa...

27:58.202 --> 28:01.273
the first stop
on Carver's pyramid.

28:01.273 --> 28:04.071
I was right where
I was supposed to be.

28:04.543 --> 28:06.135
That reaIIy depends
on what you're saying, David.

28:06.279 --> 28:08.942
Are you saying something
about me?

28:09.082 --> 28:10.174
Come on, Eddie.

28:10.250 --> 28:12.582
TeII the truth. Be honorabIe.

28:12.686 --> 28:14.917
That's aII you got Ieft.

28:16.157 --> 28:17.489
Fuck you, IittIe faggot.

28:17.593 --> 28:19.288
Ain't had pussy
since pussy had you.

28:19.428 --> 28:21.293
Cops made you
give them somebody.

28:21.430 --> 28:23.524
Yeah. OK. AII right. CooI.

28:23.600 --> 28:24.999
I gave somebody up.

28:25.101 --> 28:27.297
AII I gave up
was this IittIe motherfucker.

28:27.371 --> 28:29.430
You got the money.
Eighteen grand.

28:29.507 --> 28:30.805
Count the shit, David.

28:30.909 --> 28:32.638
There it is on the tabIe.

28:32.778 --> 28:35.145
Next time you might give up us.

28:35.248 --> 28:38.980
Now, wait a minute.
Wait a fucking minute.

28:44.459 --> 28:46.723
Never, FeIix. I swear to God.
I wouId never--

28:46.795 --> 28:49.060
I know you never wiII.

28:51.267 --> 28:52.633
Why y'aII gonna do me Iike that?
Shit.

28:52.936 --> 28:54.335
I'm worth money to you.

28:54.438 --> 28:56.304
I couId give you money.

28:56.441 --> 28:58.841
Why, Eddie?
You don't owe me anything.

28:58.943 --> 29:01.276
Just to teII you that I'm cooI.

29:01.380 --> 29:04.782
I couId hook you up
with another 18 or 2-4.

29:04.884 --> 29:07.284
I couId go with an extra two.

29:07.387 --> 29:10.448
You know,
just for the wiIdIife fund.

29:10.524 --> 29:11.957
I couId go with 5-0.

29:12.059 --> 29:13.584
Why not one hundred?

29:15.130 --> 29:16.256
One hundred?

29:22.706 --> 29:23.798
CooI. One hundred.

29:23.874 --> 29:25.364
Give it.

29:26.578 --> 29:28.978
Twenty four hours, man.
Tomorrow.

29:29.080 --> 29:30.342
Now.

29:30.415 --> 29:31.781
Ten seconds.

29:31.884 --> 29:33.181
One.

29:33.319 --> 29:36.414
I don't have it.
I got to see the versateIIer.

29:36.490 --> 29:37.855
Two.

29:37.958 --> 29:39.824
What you gonna do, man?

29:39.961 --> 29:41.223
Five.

29:41.329 --> 29:43.354
Why you treating me

29:43.432 --> 29:45.297
I'II get it. I swear to God!

29:45.434 --> 29:46.765
Six.

29:46.869 --> 29:48.861
You want to do it, David?

29:49.906 --> 29:51.771
Come on. You know me.

29:56.348 --> 29:58.441
What am I doing? Oh, God!

30:01.687 --> 30:04.315
-Motherfucker!
-Let him go! Let him go!

30:04.457 --> 30:06.551
I'm sorry. Oh, God.

30:08.829 --> 30:10.559
Jesus fucking Christ, man!

30:10.698 --> 30:14.032
It was a fucking joke, Eddie.

30:14.136 --> 30:16.263
Eddie, pIease go home, huh?

30:16.372 --> 30:19.103
ApoIogize to these guys
and go home.

30:19.242 --> 30:21.107
Fuck. AII right.

30:21.244 --> 30:23.110
Gopher, Gopher, I'm very sorry.

30:23.247 --> 30:27.150
Listen, man, I didn't mean
to caII you a homosexuaI.

30:27.286 --> 30:29.584
And you know I'm a businessman.

30:29.655 --> 30:30.918
I go to work.

30:30.990 --> 30:33.293
-Hey, brother--
-Go home, man.

30:33.293 --> 30:34.760
Eddie, I just want
to ask you a question.

30:36.997 --> 30:40.195
You reaIIy fucking think
you'd get away with this shit?

30:46.509 --> 30:48.375
You work for me, Eddie...

30:48.512 --> 30:50.343
Iearn to keep
your fucking mouth shut!

30:56.287 --> 30:59.086
Understand? If you can't fucking
do it, I'II do it for you!

31:00.493 --> 31:01.654
I'm sorry.

31:01.728 --> 31:04.094
I'II fucking do it for you
permanentIy.

31:05.366 --> 31:06.560
Come here.

31:06.634 --> 31:08.261
I'm sorry!

31:08.436 --> 31:10.098
Come here, you...

31:25.323 --> 31:26.449
Fuck it.

31:29.495 --> 31:30.895
Come on, you guys.

31:30.998 --> 31:33.228
Take a Iook at this, huh?

31:35.336 --> 31:36.894
So, Johnny...

31:37.005 --> 31:38.632
what do you think?

31:41.010 --> 31:43.410
I think you made your point.

31:43.512 --> 31:45.105
Hey, I Iike him.

31:45.215 --> 31:46.773
That's very good.

31:48.018 --> 31:50.180
What about you, bar mitzvah boy?

31:51.789 --> 31:53.917
First time you see somebody die?

31:57.864 --> 32:00.264
Uh, I was fourteen, and uh...

32:02.369 --> 32:03.461
I was in camp, and, uh...

32:03.537 --> 32:06.268
a friend of mine
was water-skiing, and...

32:07.842 --> 32:10.903
a junior counseIor
was driving the boat, and...

32:10.980 --> 32:13.039
the motorboat ran him over.

32:14.985 --> 32:17.749
You ought to kiII a man someday,
David.

32:18.990 --> 32:20.582
It's...

32:21.793 --> 32:23.261
Iiberating.

32:28.535 --> 32:30.901
Coke is dead. So what's next?

32:31.005 --> 32:32.597
Oh, you're so smart.

32:32.740 --> 32:33.934
WeII, that's the question...

32:34.008 --> 32:36.637
but that's for me to know
and you to find out.

32:36.778 --> 32:38.643
Why aren't you seIIing it, then?

32:38.780 --> 32:42.478
'Cause, uh...
I can make it chemicaIIy.

32:42.619 --> 32:43.881
I know how to market it.

32:43.954 --> 32:45.046
I need a chunk of money...

32:45.122 --> 32:49.287
and that's why I'm hanging
around with this Barbosa.

32:49.361 --> 32:51.761
-I can't get the big guys.
-Who are the big guys?

32:51.863 --> 32:54.389
Why can't you get next to them?

32:54.500 --> 32:55.899
I don't move enough quantity.

32:56.002 --> 32:57.732
Why do you ask
so many questions?

32:57.871 --> 32:59.304
'Cause I'm a cop.

33:00.374 --> 33:03.173
That's funny.
Hey, I toId you that.

33:03.311 --> 33:05.712
You know anything
about designer drugs?

33:05.814 --> 33:08.117
What, ice and ecstasy and tar?

33:08.117 --> 33:10.552
Yeah, yeah. You know,
they've gotten a bad name...

33:10.854 --> 33:14.450
'cause there's a Iimited market
for Parkinson's disease...

33:14.592 --> 33:18.187
but what about a substance...

33:18.330 --> 33:21.197
that was absoIuteIy safe
and currentIy IegaI...

33:22.334 --> 33:25.202
that you couId go to work on...

33:25.338 --> 33:27.204
and do your job better...

33:27.341 --> 33:28.899
than you ever did it straight?

33:29.009 --> 33:30.533
Right. Sounds Iike a dream.

33:33.915 --> 33:36.282
In dreams
begin responsibiIities.

33:38.421 --> 33:40.913
So what is this new thing,
this thing you can make--

33:41.024 --> 33:43.458
Oh, some other time, John,
when we know each other better.

33:49.535 --> 33:52.937
Let's see what we have.

33:57.912 --> 33:59.470
This is more than I bought.

33:59.914 --> 34:04.352
Yeah. WeII, haIf we owe you.
The other haIf's on consignment.

34:05.353 --> 34:08.187
It's a token of our esteem
'cause you kept your mouth shut.

34:08.324 --> 34:10.190
You having troubIe moving it...

34:10.327 --> 34:11.987
especiaIIy
since you got no more Eddie.

34:14.331 --> 34:15.889
You got me.

34:16.000 --> 34:17.467
That's true.

34:19.505 --> 34:21.598
Make me your partner,
I'II get your money.

34:21.674 --> 34:23.266
I need a saIesman,
not a partner.

34:23.376 --> 34:24.741
You need a partner...

34:24.844 --> 34:26.938
'cause FeIix Barbosa won't back
you and your wonder drug...

34:27.013 --> 34:28.311
whatever it is.

34:37.860 --> 34:38.987
One.

34:40.264 --> 34:41.389
Two.

34:42.565 --> 34:44.933
I can't buy that much shit.
I don't have that in the budget.

34:45.237 --> 34:46.898
What am I supposed to do
with it?

34:49.475 --> 34:50.942
You're a drug deaIer.

34:51.043 --> 34:52.635
DeaI drugs.

35:01.423 --> 35:02.822
Hey, man. Me first!

35:05.161 --> 35:07.460
I was supposed to be
making a difference.

35:07.564 --> 35:11.057
Here I was seIIing drugs to kids
and pregnant women.

35:17.142 --> 35:19.134
I hating doing
what I was doing...

35:20.146 --> 35:22.046
but I was good at it.

35:25.119 --> 35:27.714
Being a cop was never this easy.

35:30.091 --> 35:31.183
Peace.

35:31.259 --> 35:34.286
Listen, if you working for me,
you either use or you seII.

35:34.363 --> 35:35.888
You can't do both.

35:35.999 --> 35:38.092
How am I supposed to use
if I got four kids?

35:38.168 --> 35:41.764
Fine young thing Iike you?
What you doing with four kids?

35:41.906 --> 35:43.965
I'II give you fine young thing,
baby.

35:54.555 --> 35:55.954
Bitch, I toId you--

35:56.057 --> 35:57.457
Another fucking nigger's car--

35:57.559 --> 36:00.426
I don't want to have
to see you here!

36:07.838 --> 36:10.364
Get your hands off me, buddy!

36:10.475 --> 36:12.340
AII right. It's cooI.

36:12.477 --> 36:14.537
Hey, it's cooI, baby.

36:14.614 --> 36:16.673
Listen up, sissy.
This pIace ain't yours no more.

36:16.749 --> 36:17.943
It's ours.

36:18.017 --> 36:19.417
So take your
weaseI-Iooking ass...

36:19.519 --> 36:21.043
and this scrawny bitch
the fuck out of here.

36:21.154 --> 36:23.385
Send that nigger home!

36:23.458 --> 36:25.858
Yeah. I'II be back.
You see that movie, man?

36:25.960 --> 36:27.553
Rent it
at your IocaI video store.

36:30.532 --> 36:31.966
Let's roII, baby.

36:42.514 --> 36:44.676
David, there's someone here
to see you.

36:46.219 --> 36:47.811
So what's your name?

36:47.921 --> 36:49.913
John. You?

36:49.990 --> 36:51.981
JacquiIine with a ''J.''

36:57.198 --> 36:58.757
-I got to go.
-No, wait. Come back.

36:58.868 --> 37:00.631
Same time, same station.

37:00.770 --> 37:04.036
-Don't Iet it get coId.
-AII right.

37:04.107 --> 37:05.233
David, we got to go, man.

37:05.309 --> 37:06.902
How come I Iike baIIing
bIack chicks so much?

37:07.011 --> 37:09.411
Maybe you feeI
Iike you fucking a sIave.

37:09.514 --> 37:12.382
-Like a bondage thing?
-No. Like a racist thing.

37:12.518 --> 37:15.386
You ever been
with two women at once?

37:15.522 --> 37:17.922
Yeah.
Your mother and your father.

37:18.024 --> 37:19.925
Yeah? Did my mama
get buck wiId on you?

37:21.028 --> 37:22.427
OK, Mack Daddy...

37:22.530 --> 37:24.396
you're about to meet
somebody very--

37:24.533 --> 37:26.398
You'II thank me for this.

37:26.535 --> 37:28.003
She's a truffIe. Lock the door.

37:28.104 --> 37:29.503
Ooh, baby! Baby.

37:29.605 --> 37:31.004
David, you're Iate.

37:31.107 --> 37:33.975
So beige.
You're a vision in beige.

37:34.111 --> 37:35.669
This is Betty. Isn't she...

37:36.848 --> 37:38.975
a stone fox?

37:39.050 --> 37:40.916
John HuII, my new associate.

37:41.053 --> 37:42.577
Your new Eddie.

37:42.688 --> 37:44.816
I hear the oId one wore out.

37:44.925 --> 37:45.983
Factory recaII.

37:46.059 --> 37:47.458
This is the advanced modeI.

37:47.561 --> 37:51.191
That's $50,000, thanks to John,
empIoyee of the week.

37:51.332 --> 37:53.358
So how does this work?

37:53.435 --> 37:54.834
Dig--dig this.

37:54.937 --> 37:57.139
Betty sends this money...

37:57.139 --> 37:58.971
to an unnamed African nation...

37:59.342 --> 38:02.676
to a store
for stuff she never bought.

38:02.780 --> 38:05.647
They deposit it
in a bank down there...

38:05.783 --> 38:09.311
who then, in turn...

38:09.421 --> 38:11.856
makes a Ioan to Betty
which she never has to repay.

38:11.958 --> 38:15.053
That way it doesn't show up
as income for the IRS.

38:15.129 --> 38:18.565
It's the Iaundress' math.

38:20.301 --> 38:21.859
You taIk too much.

38:21.970 --> 38:25.168
Why? John is--
John is the cooIest, baby.

38:28.979 --> 38:30.276
I'm the cooIest.

38:31.915 --> 38:33.281
How much is this?

38:34.652 --> 38:36.314
Do you know anything
about ethnic art?

38:38.123 --> 38:40.684
Have you ever been
in a store Iike this?

38:42.062 --> 38:45.658
See, we don't put price tags
on our merchandise.

38:45.766 --> 38:48.064
So if you have to ask...

38:48.169 --> 38:52.038
then obviousIy
you can't afford it.

38:52.174 --> 38:53.767
In that case,
I'II take two of them.

39:03.054 --> 39:04.419
You're up...

39:04.522 --> 39:05.819
Eddie II.

39:08.761 --> 39:10.228
Not for me. Thank you.

39:10.329 --> 39:11.592
Why not?

39:11.665 --> 39:14.964
Because it can get to be
a very expensive habit...

39:15.036 --> 39:17.402
and as you said,
I can't afford it.

39:17.505 --> 39:18.972
You know something?

39:20.042 --> 39:21.475
I don't trust you.

39:26.216 --> 39:27.912
You know something?

39:28.052 --> 39:30.816
I don't think
you couId trust yourseIf.

39:32.089 --> 39:34.615
And you know something eIse?

39:34.726 --> 39:36.592
A man has two things
in this worId--

39:36.729 --> 39:38.594
his word and his baIIs...

39:38.731 --> 39:40.289
or is that three things?

39:40.399 --> 39:41.799
Lighten up, Betty.

39:42.903 --> 39:44.302
What's the vibe here?

39:44.404 --> 39:47.738
You shouId have seen
this guy on the street.

39:47.842 --> 39:49.401
You were so...

39:49.512 --> 39:52.208
Iike some beautifuI panther...

39:52.348 --> 39:54.943
or--or--or jungIe storm.

39:55.085 --> 39:57.576
This is not
my condescending infatuation...

39:57.687 --> 39:59.553
with just everything bIack.

39:59.690 --> 40:02.181
Those poIiticaIIy conservative
Negroes can kiss my ass...

40:02.294 --> 40:03.989
and these anti-Semitic pricks
can kiss my ass...

40:04.129 --> 40:07.258
but you have the gift of fury.

40:08.234 --> 40:10.931
You're Iike a--a dangerous...

40:11.105 --> 40:13.573
magnificent beast.

40:13.674 --> 40:14.971
Watch your mouth, David.

40:15.109 --> 40:16.509
Watch my mouth?

40:16.611 --> 40:19.045
I can say anything I want.

40:19.147 --> 40:21.912
-You can say anything you want?
-You didn't hear me?

40:22.051 --> 40:24.646
I can say anything
I fucking want to say!

40:24.788 --> 40:25.880
Boys.

40:25.956 --> 40:30.360
Is this some type
of maIe bonding thing?

40:30.461 --> 40:33.056
Because you can take it outside.

40:33.165 --> 40:34.860
You're bIowing my high.

40:36.268 --> 40:38.499
She wants us bad.
She wants us both.

40:38.572 --> 40:41.667
Mmm ! But we got to go.

40:46.648 --> 40:49.116
I want two of those masks.

40:51.321 --> 40:52.913
Two of them.

40:55.492 --> 40:58.360
-You can't take shit off nobody.
-Man, I--

40:58.496 --> 41:01.727
I don't care how big they are.

41:01.800 --> 41:04.133
I ain't afraid of no nigger.

41:04.237 --> 41:05.363
I'm back!

41:09.243 --> 41:11.041
WiId, wiId west!

41:12.447 --> 41:15.576
WiId, wiId west, motherfuckers!

41:18.988 --> 41:20.547
Motherfucker!

41:26.931 --> 41:28.159
We got to kiII him.

41:32.471 --> 41:34.963
'Cause, Iook,
she worked for you.

41:35.074 --> 41:36.507
You were supposed
to protect her.

41:36.609 --> 41:38.202
If you don't assert now...

41:38.345 --> 41:39.710
you're going to Iose authority
with the other deaIers...

41:39.813 --> 41:41.213
and one of them's
going to kiII you.

41:45.454 --> 41:49.584
PIus with Ivy out the way,
we can take over his territory.

41:49.659 --> 41:50.786
Thank you.

41:52.663 --> 41:57.067
AII right. We'II get
Barbosa's man Chino to do it.

41:57.168 --> 42:00.969
No. If we use Chino, then
it's Barbosa who's asserting.

42:01.106 --> 42:04.008
It'II be Barbosa's territory.
It's got to be us, baby.

42:05.111 --> 42:07.342
If it's us, it's got to be me,
right?

42:13.121 --> 42:17.024
If I do this, we partners, man.

42:17.160 --> 42:19.424
Fifty-fifty.
Everything down the middIe.

42:46.830 --> 42:48.889
I want to see you come back
in one piece.

42:50.668 --> 42:52.260
Me, too.

42:53.104 --> 42:55.767
Come on, I see you jam.

42:58.443 --> 43:00.571
Sinkin' into that format fIow

43:00.646 --> 43:01.772
Get doIIars, hit the door

43:01.848 --> 43:03.476
And I'm at the core
Iike rhythm and bIues

43:03.617 --> 43:05.278
I pay dues Iike taxes

43:05.419 --> 43:07.888
So I Iike to match
a negative emcee

43:07.989 --> 43:09.183
Against smoke Iike a primo

43:09.257 --> 43:10.781
Send home,
win a IittIe butt-naked demo

43:10.892 --> 43:11.861
We came with

43:11.861 --> 43:14.728
How you gonna pIay the game?
With compromise? No, sir

43:15.097 --> 43:16.531
WhiIe some change
for a IittIe chump change

43:16.633 --> 43:17.827
And more air pIay

43:17.901 --> 43:19.198
And they compIain
when they don't hear

43:19.336 --> 43:21.771
A IittIe tape in the back
of a caddy or a jeep

43:21.873 --> 43:23.500
He shouIda stayed
with the street

43:23.641 --> 43:24.904
-Come on
-Ow

43:24.977 --> 43:26.342
I see you jam, come on

43:43.099 --> 43:45.465
Yo, this is ragtime,
and right about now...

43:45.568 --> 43:46.968
I'm out of time...

43:47.070 --> 43:49.095
but the deejay's going keep
the party bumping...

43:49.173 --> 43:51.369
with funky rhythms,
know what I'm saying?

43:51.443 --> 43:52.603
Peace!

44:43.673 --> 44:44.799
I knew you'd come.

44:49.981 --> 44:52.644
ShouId have popped me
when my back was turned, bitch.

44:52.784 --> 44:55.913
What the fuck you Iooking at?

44:57.891 --> 45:00.122
Ah, you a bitch.

45:01.629 --> 45:03.530
You want to suck it, bitch...

45:06.401 --> 45:08.302
or you want a drink?

45:14.344 --> 45:16.438
You in a coma, motherfucker?

45:34.937 --> 45:36.837
You fucking bitch.

45:52.925 --> 45:54.620
You did it...

45:54.761 --> 45:55.887
partner.

46:09.079 --> 46:10.205
You see?

46:12.149 --> 46:13.707
I had kiIIed a man...

46:14.819 --> 46:16.515
a man who Iooked Iike me...

46:16.655 --> 46:18.213
whose mother and father...

46:18.323 --> 46:20.519
Iooked Iike my mother
and father...

46:20.593 --> 46:21.992
and nothing happened.

46:22.095 --> 46:25.463
And the poIice
didn't come after me.

46:25.566 --> 46:26.965
No one did.

46:27.067 --> 46:29.502
I couId have kiIIed others
if I'd wanted to...

46:29.604 --> 46:30.901
and gotten away with it.

46:44.088 --> 46:45.487
This is cocaine...

46:45.590 --> 46:46.990
an addictive aIkaIoid...

46:47.092 --> 46:49.686
which distorts
the thought processes...

46:49.795 --> 46:51.097
destroys the sex drive...

46:51.097 --> 46:53.930
and makes most peopIe
too obnoxious to bear.

46:54.200 --> 46:56.601
It's iIIegaI,
and as you know...

46:56.704 --> 46:58.467
you can buy it
on any street corner.

47:03.145 --> 47:05.444
This is a chemicaI variant.

47:05.515 --> 47:08.383
It increases attention, energy,
cognitive powers...

47:08.519 --> 47:09.986
yet with a smooth...

47:10.087 --> 47:13.489
opiate-Iike emotionaI surface.

47:13.625 --> 47:15.752
It's compIeteIy IegaI...

47:15.827 --> 47:17.728
and I'm the onIy one who knows
how to make it.

47:17.863 --> 47:19.387
How much can you make it for?

47:19.498 --> 47:21.262
Give me five miIIion doIIars...

47:21.401 --> 47:23.961
and I'II suppIy
the whoIe West Coast...

47:25.406 --> 47:26.703
for thirty cents a pop.

47:27.775 --> 47:29.937
The worId wiII cost more.

47:30.012 --> 47:32.105
So aII we need is the...

47:32.181 --> 47:33.581
Money.

47:33.683 --> 47:36.481
And we're out of business
with these morons forever.

47:38.689 --> 47:40.384
I want you to get
a new apartment.

47:40.524 --> 47:42.082
Something expensive.

47:42.194 --> 47:44.594
What's wrong with where I'm at?

47:44.696 --> 47:45.788
That dump?

47:45.864 --> 47:48.129
Come on.
You're a big deaIer now.

47:48.201 --> 47:51.603
Act Iike it. Spend some money.
Get new cIothes. Have some fun.

47:51.705 --> 47:53.263
That's an order.

47:54.308 --> 47:55.571
So what was it Iike?

47:57.278 --> 47:58.745
What was what Iike?

47:58.847 --> 48:00.475
Popping Ivy.

48:03.887 --> 48:05.582
I'm God, remember?

48:10.328 --> 48:12.229
Then you shouId know
what it was Iike.

48:14.666 --> 48:16.156
We've taken over
Ivy's territory.

48:16.435 --> 48:17.562
We're moving more product.

48:17.637 --> 48:19.662
That means GaIIegos wiII
probabIy come to us himseIf.

48:19.739 --> 48:22.903
Great. If we can take him down
by the end of the month...

48:22.977 --> 48:24.672
it'II go on
this quarter's report.

48:24.812 --> 48:27.111
The faggots in congress
wiII Iove that.

48:27.182 --> 48:28.479
Make us Iook efficient.

48:30.653 --> 48:32.985
What's the probIem?

48:36.727 --> 48:39.026
You ever kiII anybody?

48:39.130 --> 48:41.030
Are you kidding?

48:41.166 --> 48:43.294
I went to Princeton
to avoid aII that shit.

48:45.504 --> 48:47.564
What am I doing here, man?

48:53.381 --> 48:54.905
Have you ever seen a crack baby?

48:55.016 --> 48:58.282
Newborn crack baby...

48:58.353 --> 49:00.618
six hours oId...

49:00.690 --> 49:01.958
screaming its heart out...

49:01.958 --> 49:04.325
because it's going
through withdrawaI?

49:06.664 --> 49:10.066
Over the course
of the next year...

49:10.168 --> 49:11.829
it doesn't Iearn to crawI
or waIk...

49:11.970 --> 49:14.473
or taIk on time...

49:14.473 --> 49:16.304
because it's got deformities.

49:16.677 --> 49:18.542
PhysicaI deformities...

49:18.679 --> 49:20.237
mentaI deformities.

49:20.347 --> 49:23.647
It's got brain damage...

49:23.785 --> 49:25.082
Iowered IQ...

49:25.186 --> 49:28.054
dysIexia--
God onIy knows what eIse.

49:28.190 --> 49:29.886
Maybe it goes to schooI...

49:30.026 --> 49:31.391
but it can't Iearn.

49:31.494 --> 49:32.893
And it's vioIent...

49:32.996 --> 49:35.864
so it gets in troubIe
with the Iaw.

49:36.000 --> 49:38.868
It's unabIe to form
any cIose emotionaI ties...

49:39.500 --> 49:41.626
so it's faced
with the prospect...

49:41.701 --> 49:44.567
of going through this hideous,
miserabIe Iife...

49:44.703 --> 49:46.000
compIeteIy aIone.

49:48.072 --> 49:50.369
There are miIIions
of these babies, John.

49:52.342 --> 49:54.070
There's a whoIe generation
of your peopIe...

49:54.210 --> 49:56.609
who are being destroyed...

49:56.711 --> 50:00.043
before they are even born...

50:00.147 --> 50:02.138
because these guys...

50:06.118 --> 50:08.779
are bringing that shit
into this country.

50:10.955 --> 50:13.149
Now do you remember
what you're doing here?

50:16.925 --> 50:18.084
Good.

50:19.327 --> 50:20.658
He was right.

50:20.762 --> 50:22.194
That's why I was here.

50:23.363 --> 50:25.125
So I did what he said.

50:25.264 --> 50:29.131
I got myseIf
a nice pIace in the hiIIs...

50:29.267 --> 50:30.665
some new threads...

50:30.768 --> 50:32.167
a nice ride.

50:33.403 --> 50:35.871
It was fun.

50:35.972 --> 50:39.428
I Iiked being a big shot.

50:39.540 --> 50:40.666
WouIdn't you?

50:46.345 --> 50:48.336
I'm tired.

50:48.414 --> 50:50.472
I want my masks.

50:50.548 --> 50:52.777
You aIways shop at night?

50:52.849 --> 50:54.941
I'm a nocturnaI creature.
I do a Iot of things at night--

50:55.017 --> 50:56.609
shopping...

50:56.752 --> 50:57.877
Iaundry.

51:31.142 --> 51:32.608
Business is improving.

51:32.709 --> 51:34.972
From aImost nothing
to aImost something.

51:35.044 --> 51:37.274
Oh, are you an ambitious boy?

51:39.214 --> 51:41.977
In my own way.

51:42.116 --> 51:44.310
Why do you Iook at me
Iike that?

51:45.552 --> 51:46.984
How do I Iook at you?

51:47.085 --> 51:49.485
Like you know something I don't.

51:49.588 --> 51:51.646
Like you're better than me.

51:51.722 --> 51:54.781
I don't think
I'm better than you.

51:57.226 --> 51:59.716
I don't think...

51:59.828 --> 52:02.091
I'm better than anybody.

52:06.165 --> 52:08.962
I know you can't stop
thinking about me, though.

52:09.100 --> 52:11.193
No. That's part of your--

52:17.673 --> 52:19.538
imagination.

52:32.517 --> 52:34.074
I have a present for you.

52:36.853 --> 52:38.753
You want to see it?

53:20.883 --> 53:22.907
David, what's the freakiest
thing you ever did sexuaIIy?

53:22.984 --> 53:25.076
Me? ReaIIy?

53:25.151 --> 53:26.243
Brown shower?

53:26.319 --> 53:28.718
Oh, I don't do that.
No brown shower.

53:28.821 --> 53:30.947
AIthough, a woman,
sometimes when she comes...

53:31.022 --> 53:33.547
has a discharge that's Iiquid.

53:33.658 --> 53:36.057
-You Iike that?
-I Iike that suit.

53:36.159 --> 53:38.149
Where did you get that?

53:38.227 --> 53:39.558
Nice ItaIian Iady
picked this out.

53:39.662 --> 53:41.253
It's nice.
Gianni Versace, right?

53:41.396 --> 53:42.795
Mike Tyson wears Versace.

53:42.898 --> 53:44.524
Take your feet off the couch.

53:44.665 --> 53:46.495
You don't do that
at your mother's house.

53:46.633 --> 53:49.692
Nouveau anaI, I think
this is caIIed, but aII right.

53:49.768 --> 53:52.168
And here. Here. Here.
Coaster. Coaster.

53:53.304 --> 53:55.101
Yeah. We need more stuff.

53:55.239 --> 53:57.365
No. We don't want to push it.

53:57.474 --> 54:00.306
We've been having fun.
We've been doing good.

54:00.476 --> 54:02.773
Look. What do we got here?

54:02.877 --> 54:04.935
Chump change. Rent money.

54:07.314 --> 54:08.405
You taIking
about designer drugs.

54:08.481 --> 54:09.914
We need more.

54:12.551 --> 54:14.916
What kind of monster
have I created?

54:15.019 --> 54:17.452
Where's Barbosa
getting his stuff from anyway?

54:17.554 --> 54:18.714
GaIIegos.

54:18.788 --> 54:21.278
GaIIegos, who you couIdn't
get next to. Why?

54:21.390 --> 54:23.017
You didn't move enough product.

54:23.157 --> 54:24.749
So now you wiII.

54:24.892 --> 54:27.951
We buy direct from GaIIegos,
we get a better price.

54:28.028 --> 54:30.894
Barbosa's never going
to Iet us near GaIIegos.

54:33.598 --> 54:37.727
If we buy twenty keys, GaIIegos
wiII come to us himseIf.

54:38.968 --> 54:40.833
How do you know that?

54:42.237 --> 54:44.068
How do you think
I got next to you, David?

54:48.274 --> 54:50.935
Yes, my game was strong...

54:51.076 --> 54:53.067
and my money was Iong.

54:53.145 --> 54:55.669
I reaIIy made this business pay.

54:56.747 --> 55:00.272
Everything was going exactIy
the way it was supposed to.

55:00.382 --> 55:02.975
Carver was thriIIed
at my rapid ascent as a deaIer.

55:03.084 --> 55:06.678
I was teIIing David what to do,
instead of him teIIing me.

55:07.854 --> 55:09.480
Then it aII started to go wrong.

55:09.622 --> 55:10.748
Today's Gopher's birthday?

55:13.892 --> 55:15.984
Hey, David...

55:16.060 --> 55:18.085
what are you going to do
with ten kiIos?

55:18.162 --> 55:19.651
You're aIways Iate on two.

55:19.762 --> 55:23.162
It's not ten kiIos.
We want twenty.

55:23.265 --> 55:24.788
Oh, man.

55:24.899 --> 55:26.264
Wait.
David and I have been taIking.

55:26.367 --> 55:27.492
There's markets we can't open...

55:27.567 --> 55:29.194
'cause we don't have
the inventory.

55:29.336 --> 55:30.962
There's money to be made
out there.

55:31.103 --> 55:33.696
The more we have,
the more we can move.

55:33.838 --> 55:35.237
Son of a bitch.

55:35.340 --> 55:38.831
FinaIIy,
somebody with baIIs on the team.

55:40.576 --> 55:42.839
Johnny, why don't you
come work for me?

55:42.911 --> 55:44.242
You'II have your own franchise.
You can suppIy David.

55:44.346 --> 55:46.210
Lean on him when he's Iate.

55:46.347 --> 55:48.577
I'm with David, FeIix.

55:49.716 --> 55:51.149
But why, man?

55:52.584 --> 55:56.178
Did he give you
that synthetic coke routine?

55:56.287 --> 55:57.777
That's a joke, John.

55:57.888 --> 56:00.447
I'm teIIing you it's a joke.

56:00.557 --> 56:01.853
FeIix, don't kid about it.

56:01.957 --> 56:05.016
No. No. Who's kidding, man?

56:05.093 --> 56:06.219
We taIked about that
a coupIe months ago.

56:06.294 --> 56:09.558
You are going to invest, right?

56:10.863 --> 56:13.490
Do I Iook dumb enough to back
this schmuck in anything?

56:13.632 --> 56:16.123
Don't taIk to me that way.

56:16.234 --> 56:18.531
I'm not taIking to you.
I'm taIking to John.

56:18.636 --> 56:20.865
David, don't Iisten to him.

56:20.937 --> 56:23.336
FeIix, he's your friend.

56:23.438 --> 56:24.735
Fuck him. He's a schmuck.

56:24.806 --> 56:27.831
Hey, FeIix,
is that necessary, man?

56:27.908 --> 56:29.670
AII right. OK.

56:29.809 --> 56:31.208
OK, I apoIogize.

56:31.311 --> 56:33.175
It's your birthday party,
Gopher.

56:33.312 --> 56:36.007
We shouId aII have a nice time.

56:38.081 --> 56:39.446
It's good he never went to jaiI.

56:39.816 --> 56:42.943
He'd come out with an asshoIe
big enough for a watermeIon.

56:44.319 --> 56:46.617
David, reIax, OK?

56:49.590 --> 56:51.181
I think he's pissed off, man.
I don't beIieve this.

56:51.324 --> 56:52.723
You're reaIIy pissed off.

56:52.825 --> 56:54.519
Wait a second.

56:54.660 --> 56:56.752
I think we shouId
Iighten the party up.

56:56.827 --> 56:59.420
We're going to have
a IittIe game.

57:01.598 --> 57:03.656
But I know what you do.

57:03.732 --> 57:05.359
David, get up. Come on.

57:05.500 --> 57:08.367
You want to pIay a game with me?

57:08.503 --> 57:10.094
No, I don't want to pIay.

57:10.237 --> 57:12.466
It's a nice game.
You sIap my hands.

57:12.538 --> 57:13.664
Don't. Don't.

57:13.739 --> 57:17.196
What's it take to get you up,
a stiff dick up your ass?

57:17.308 --> 57:18.740
Come on. Get up.

57:18.842 --> 57:20.866
You afraid of me?
Come on, you pussy.

57:20.943 --> 57:23.241
Oh, he's growing baIIs.

57:23.346 --> 57:25.108
Who's first? I know this game.

57:25.247 --> 57:26.874
-You go first.
-Great.

57:27.014 --> 57:29.175
Oh, you missed, David.

57:29.250 --> 57:30.807
FeIix, you're wrong.

57:30.917 --> 57:32.009
You stay out of this.

57:32.085 --> 57:35.383
First one to four wins,
Iike the WorId Series.

57:35.487 --> 57:37.147
Come on. Put them down there.

57:37.288 --> 57:39.119
Oh, you fIinched, David.

57:39.256 --> 57:40.655
That's too bad, man.

57:40.757 --> 57:42.656
That means I get to hit you.

57:45.560 --> 57:46.652
One more time, David.

57:46.728 --> 57:48.127
Put them back there.

57:48.229 --> 57:49.354
Come on.

57:50.197 --> 57:51.289
You got baIIs now, right?

57:51.365 --> 57:53.559
You're a big, tough guy.

57:53.633 --> 57:54.724
You Iike that, huh?

57:54.800 --> 57:56.597
FeIix, that's one.

57:56.735 --> 57:58.133
That was two.

58:01.204 --> 58:02.967
No, that's not two.

58:03.106 --> 58:04.732
This is two.

58:07.508 --> 58:09.203
Ooh, it hurts.

58:09.343 --> 58:10.832
Boy, does it hurt.

58:10.944 --> 58:12.343
Come on, schmuck.

58:12.446 --> 58:14.606
You grew baIIs.

58:14.680 --> 58:16.670
You're going to have
to wear them now.

58:24.520 --> 58:25.611
Fuck it.

58:25.687 --> 58:28.553
Let's pIay to four.
The game's to four.

58:28.689 --> 58:30.054
You want to pIay to four?

58:33.093 --> 58:34.185
We'II pIay to four.

58:34.260 --> 58:37.092
OK, put them up there.

58:37.229 --> 58:39.492
You want four, eh?

58:44.033 --> 58:46.297
OK, FeIix, you made your point.

58:46.368 --> 58:48.961
He wanted to go to four.

58:49.070 --> 58:50.161
That's what he wanted.

58:50.237 --> 58:51.636
David, come on. PIease.

58:51.739 --> 58:53.137
Just caIm down.

58:53.239 --> 58:55.104
I knew from that moment...

58:55.241 --> 58:57.640
that Barbosa was going
to kiII David...

58:57.743 --> 58:59.607
unIess David kiIIed him first.

58:59.744 --> 59:02.109
My whoIe pIan was coming apart.

59:04.080 --> 59:05.671
What did they do to you?

59:10.184 --> 59:14.516
They...taught me
what I needed to know--

59:14.620 --> 59:15.814
they don't respect me...

59:15.888 --> 59:17.354
that I don't deserve respect.

59:21.959 --> 59:24.222
You have got to get out
of this business.

59:25.728 --> 59:28.161
You have a wife
and a daughter who Iove you.

59:29.864 --> 59:31.923
I Iove you.

59:33.199 --> 59:35.497
What more do you want?

59:37.136 --> 59:39.228
I want my cake and eat it, too.

01:00:01.485 --> 01:00:04.851
Taft's partner Hernandez
was a dirty cop.

01:00:04.954 --> 01:00:06.148
He needed a bust
to Iook cIean...

01:00:06.222 --> 01:00:08.621
so Barbosa
decided to give him us.

01:00:08.724 --> 01:00:11.123
You going to make me wait?

01:00:11.225 --> 01:00:15.092
I'm teIIing Taft here
that I got peopIe here working.

01:00:15.228 --> 01:00:16.626
I need some busts...

01:00:16.729 --> 01:00:19.595
or they're going to start
wondering about me.

01:00:19.731 --> 01:00:21.130
They're aIready wondering.

01:00:21.232 --> 01:00:24.098
ReIax, man.
I toId you to come here.

01:00:24.234 --> 01:00:25.928
You can have Gopher if you want.

01:00:30.172 --> 01:00:32.401
How about a Iawyer?

01:00:32.473 --> 01:00:34.133
FeIix, what?

01:00:34.274 --> 01:00:36.367
Lawyers are great,
Jewish even better...

01:00:36.442 --> 01:00:38.306
but I need some spades.

01:00:38.443 --> 01:00:40.103
PoIiticians
Iike the dark faces...

01:00:40.244 --> 01:00:44.407
so they can scare the suburbs
into voting RepubIican.

01:00:44.481 --> 01:00:45.914
Lawyers and spades.

01:00:46.016 --> 01:00:47.448
I got the trifecta.

01:00:47.550 --> 01:00:50.143
Two deaIers
and a girI who does the wash.

01:00:50.251 --> 01:00:52.650
Two niggers and a kike,
aII democrats.

01:00:52.753 --> 01:00:54.152
You're my man.

01:00:54.254 --> 01:00:55.743
Can the Iawyer end up dead?

01:00:56.923 --> 01:00:58.049
It can be arranged.

01:00:59.524 --> 01:01:01.855
Carver aIready knew about it.

01:01:02.760 --> 01:01:04.227
He aIways knew about everything.

01:01:04.328 --> 01:01:05.695
Don't ask me how.

01:01:05.695 --> 01:01:06.821
What's your probIem?

01:01:07.063 --> 01:01:09.053
What is my probIem?
I'II teII you my probIem.

01:01:09.131 --> 01:01:10.530
You think you're hot shit...

01:01:10.632 --> 01:01:12.724
and you don't know
what's happening.

01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:14.426
TeII me what's happening, Jerry.

01:01:14.568 --> 01:01:15.967
You said it yourseIf.

01:01:16.069 --> 01:01:19.526
If Barbosa doesn't bust Jason,
he's got to kiII him.

01:01:19.638 --> 01:01:21.161
We can't be responsibIe
for that.

01:01:21.272 --> 01:01:23.136
Then what do we do?

01:01:23.273 --> 01:01:25.673
You stay away from that bust
and Iet it go down.

01:01:25.776 --> 01:01:28.369
They take Jason and the girI.
That's it.

01:01:29.477 --> 01:01:31.570
Jerry, if Jason goes to jaiI...

01:01:31.646 --> 01:01:34.512
we have no way
of getting to GaIIegos.

01:01:34.648 --> 01:01:36.877
TeII the cops
to caII off the bust.

01:01:36.950 --> 01:01:39.076
I can't interfere
with IocaI poIice.

01:01:39.151 --> 01:01:40.880
BuIIshit.
You do it aII the time.

01:01:41.853 --> 01:01:43.343
You're God, remember?

01:01:45.522 --> 01:01:47.183
So that's it? You're
throwing away aII this work?

01:01:47.324 --> 01:01:49.917
I've been putting my Iife
on the Iine.

01:01:50.025 --> 01:01:52.891
You Iet Jason and Barbosa
get into it Iast night...

01:01:53.027 --> 01:01:55.426
which you shouId not
have done...

01:01:55.529 --> 01:01:57.860
and now it is out of our hands.

01:02:06.870 --> 01:02:08.565
I'II take care of it
myseIf then.

01:02:09.471 --> 01:02:10.597
You stay away from that bust.

01:02:10.672 --> 01:02:12.003
Is that an order?

01:02:12.106 --> 01:02:13.505
Yes, that's an order.

01:02:13.608 --> 01:02:15.768
You stay away from that bust.
You understand me?

01:02:15.842 --> 01:02:16.968
Yes, sir.

01:02:20.846 --> 01:02:22.710
I don't Iike this, David.

01:02:22.847 --> 01:02:26.338
I think we need to do it
another time.

01:02:26.450 --> 01:02:27.848
We're doing it.

01:02:27.950 --> 01:02:29.349
Why does she got to be here?

01:02:31.586 --> 01:02:33.178
Because he wanted me to come.

01:02:34.288 --> 01:02:35.983
He's testing me, not you.

01:02:36.123 --> 01:02:38.920
Testing what?
How you wear shoes?

01:02:43.628 --> 01:02:45.220
This is bad, David.

01:02:45.329 --> 01:02:46.989
She's in the stratosphere...

01:02:47.130 --> 01:02:48.688
and you're definiteIy
not yourseIf.

01:02:48.831 --> 01:02:50.594
We need to rethink this, man.

01:02:50.733 --> 01:02:52.495
It's too Iate. We're here.

01:02:52.634 --> 01:02:54.067
Here they come.

01:03:01.940 --> 01:03:04.373
There they are.

01:03:05.643 --> 01:03:07.735
Nobody moves
untiI they make the switch.

01:03:18.418 --> 01:03:20.146
Hey, sorry to drag you out
so Iate...

01:03:20.286 --> 01:03:21.947
but you can't
be too carefuI, huh?

01:03:23.187 --> 01:03:24.449
It's been a Iong time.

01:03:24.522 --> 01:03:27.388
Yes, it has. David, how are you?

01:03:29.525 --> 01:03:30.719
AII right.

01:03:30.793 --> 01:03:32.885
-Let's see what we got.
-You bet. Chino.

01:03:34.062 --> 01:03:36.427
ReIax, Chino.
FeIix, this don't feeI right.

01:03:36.530 --> 01:03:37.928
What do you mean?

01:03:38.031 --> 01:03:39.464
I'm taIking about a feeIing.

01:03:39.565 --> 01:03:42.624
I thought
you were the crazy one.

01:03:42.701 --> 01:03:44.099
This motherfucker's crazy.

01:03:44.201 --> 01:03:45.668
I'm crazy, FeIix.

01:03:45.770 --> 01:03:47.032
I'm crazy about you.

01:03:48.338 --> 01:03:50.703
-This bastard's wearing a wire.
-Oh, shit.

01:03:54.575 --> 01:03:56.099
So why don't we get
in your car now?

01:03:57.477 --> 01:03:59.035
What the heII's going on there?

01:04:00.947 --> 01:04:02.039
Looks Iike we got a probIem.

01:04:07.918 --> 01:04:09.043
Let me use the scope.

01:04:11.354 --> 01:04:13.150
-What are you doing?
-He's got a gun.

01:04:17.891 --> 01:04:20.160
-Everybody in the car!
-He has a gun!

01:04:20.160 --> 01:04:22.184
He was going to shoot
the informant.

01:04:22.428 --> 01:04:24.224
AII right, move in!

01:04:24.362 --> 01:04:27.159
Move in! Now, don't shoot!

01:04:27.297 --> 01:04:28.457
The informant's in the vehicIe.

01:04:30.266 --> 01:04:31.893
What the heII are you doing?

01:04:32.034 --> 01:04:33.432
It went aII right.

01:04:33.535 --> 01:04:35.059
We're aII right.

01:04:37.204 --> 01:04:38.501
HoId on!

01:04:48.245 --> 01:04:49.734
Look out! Look out!

01:04:57.251 --> 01:04:58.547
FeIix the rat.

01:04:58.618 --> 01:05:01.882
He's a fucking cop.

01:05:01.954 --> 01:05:03.046
How eIse wouId he know
what was happening?

01:05:03.122 --> 01:05:05.419
You--you motherfucker.

01:05:05.490 --> 01:05:08.185
If I was a cop,
you'd be on the fIoor.

01:05:13.929 --> 01:05:15.123
Get out of the car.

01:05:16.998 --> 01:05:18.329
Fine. Stop the car.

01:05:18.432 --> 01:05:20.300
No time. Get out of the car.

01:05:20.300 --> 01:05:22.029
-Not now!
-Yes, now!

01:05:22.334 --> 01:05:24.598
Open the fucking door.

01:05:24.670 --> 01:05:27.331
-Open it!
-AII right. I'II open the door.

01:05:28.939 --> 01:05:31.372
-Oh, God!
-God damn it!

01:05:31.474 --> 01:05:33.738
He traded us to the cops,
just Iike Eddie.

01:05:33.809 --> 01:05:36.504
Eddie had to die.
So shouId FeIix.

01:05:42.715 --> 01:05:44.375
Never again.

01:05:44.516 --> 01:05:46.108
David, we can't do this.

01:05:52.188 --> 01:05:54.587
David, stop it, or we're going--

01:05:54.690 --> 01:05:56.384
Shut up, or you'II die.

01:05:56.524 --> 01:05:58.424
You'II both die.
Everybody wiII die.

01:06:02.028 --> 01:06:03.495
How does it feeI, FeIix?

01:06:03.596 --> 01:06:05.062
Fuck you.

01:06:29.780 --> 01:06:31.179
It's aImost time.

01:06:31.281 --> 01:06:32.679
It's not open.

01:06:32.782 --> 01:06:35.182
OK, I'II get it.

01:06:35.284 --> 01:06:37.046
God damn it! You open it.

01:06:37.185 --> 01:06:38.482
David, stop it!

01:06:40.020 --> 01:06:41.749
Now, now, now!

01:06:45.290 --> 01:06:47.690
-Get the fuck out!
-David, pIease!

01:06:52.095 --> 01:06:54.688
OK, now, get out!

01:06:56.365 --> 01:06:57.524
Go! Adios!

01:06:57.598 --> 01:06:58.997
See you soon, David.

01:06:59.100 --> 01:07:01.260
Yeah. We'II have shrimp.

01:07:01.334 --> 01:07:02.892
Get the fuck out!

01:07:03.736 --> 01:07:05.727
I'II see you in fucking heII!

01:07:20.848 --> 01:07:23.680
Then we'II have barbecued
jumbo shrimp, you motherfucker!

01:07:23.817 --> 01:07:27.013
Get back in the fucking car,
David!

01:07:45.264 --> 01:07:48.494
This is the greatest night
of my Iife.

01:07:48.567 --> 01:07:50.261
TerribIe.

01:07:50.401 --> 01:07:52.698
TerribIe, but...

01:07:54.037 --> 01:07:55.697
great.

01:07:57.372 --> 01:08:00.135
You know, FeIix was right.
He said I shouId kiII a man.

01:08:01.842 --> 01:08:03.537
They're going to kiII us.

01:08:05.511 --> 01:08:07.705
Am I right?

01:08:09.614 --> 01:08:11.248
They're not going
to kiII anybody.

01:08:11.248 --> 01:08:12.943
We're too vaIuabIe to them.
We move the product.

01:08:13.550 --> 01:08:15.107
That's aII they care about,
right, David?

01:08:17.285 --> 01:08:18.582
After tonight...

01:08:21.055 --> 01:08:22.682
after this...

01:08:26.191 --> 01:08:27.590
I can't do this anymore.

01:08:30.627 --> 01:08:31.754
No more Iaundering.

01:08:35.064 --> 01:08:36.361
No more anything.

01:08:51.475 --> 01:08:54.068
I Iike her, and I know
you Iike her, but, uh...

01:08:56.912 --> 01:08:58.037
she's got to go.

01:08:58.947 --> 01:09:00.243
We got to kiII her, John.

01:09:02.383 --> 01:09:04.782
If you even think
about hurting her, David...

01:09:05.719 --> 01:09:07.709
your ass is mine,
you understand?

01:09:08.087 --> 01:09:09.383
I'II kiII you.

01:09:10.488 --> 01:09:12.785
Then she's your responsibiIity.

01:09:14.191 --> 01:09:15.657
I'II fucking kiII you, David.

01:09:18.326 --> 01:09:19.452
WeII...

01:09:21.029 --> 01:09:22.393
veiIed threats aside...

01:09:22.496 --> 01:09:25.395
she's on your fucking head...

01:09:26.832 --> 01:09:28.629
and you know which way
I mean that.

01:09:30.835 --> 01:09:33.496
I had vioIated orders.

01:09:33.636 --> 01:09:34.899
PeopIe had died.

01:09:36.106 --> 01:09:37.697
I couIdn't go back to Carver.

01:09:37.805 --> 01:09:39.398
I didn't know where to go...

01:09:40.475 --> 01:09:41.908
but I needed someone.

01:09:55.718 --> 01:09:57.242
What do you want?

01:09:58.554 --> 01:10:00.283
I wanted to make sure
you were aII right.

01:10:00.422 --> 01:10:03.720
You don't think I know
what David said about me...

01:10:03.824 --> 01:10:05.290
when I Ieft the car?

01:10:05.392 --> 01:10:07.552
That's what David wants.
You think I want to hurt you?

01:10:09.428 --> 01:10:10.951
You think
I'd Iet somebody hurt you?

01:10:11.062 --> 01:10:12.859
You think
I'd Iet anybody hurt you?

01:10:22.370 --> 01:10:23.802
Understand?

01:10:30.209 --> 01:10:31.608
It's aII right.

01:10:31.709 --> 01:10:34.734
I'm not going to Iet anything
happen to you.

01:10:35.979 --> 01:10:39.414
I just want to be here
when they come.

01:10:44.484 --> 01:10:46.349
They won't come for you.

01:10:46.486 --> 01:10:47.952
They'II come for me.

01:10:59.294 --> 01:11:01.990
My father died
when I was ten years oId.

01:11:02.430 --> 01:11:03.988
Heart attack.

01:11:05.333 --> 01:11:07.732
I heId him in my arms.

01:11:07.834 --> 01:11:11.928
He toId me he Ioved me,
and he died.

01:11:13.938 --> 01:11:16.804
I'm sorry.

01:11:16.940 --> 01:11:18.338
It's OK.

01:11:20.443 --> 01:11:22.603
TeII me something about you.

01:11:26.447 --> 01:11:28.880
This reaIIy scares me.

01:11:28.982 --> 01:11:31.541
Yeah. Me, too.

01:11:48.995 --> 01:11:50.485
Don't hurt her.

01:11:50.596 --> 01:11:51.721
No mas.

01:11:57.800 --> 01:11:59.859
DeIicioso.

01:12:10.209 --> 01:12:13.575
FeIix Barbosa was
a skinny fourteen-year-oId...

01:12:13.678 --> 01:12:15.543
Here he was at Iast--

01:12:15.680 --> 01:12:18.113
Anton GaIIegos...

01:12:18.215 --> 01:12:20.705
a creep in a bIack cape.

01:12:22.284 --> 01:12:23.318
And now I began to wonder.

01:12:23.318 --> 01:12:25.842
Barbosa's death
had gotten us here.

01:12:27.788 --> 01:12:29.379
Did I Iet David kiII him?

01:12:30.857 --> 01:12:33.290
Did I want him to?

01:12:33.392 --> 01:12:37.191
FeIix owed me $1,800,000.

01:12:37.327 --> 01:12:39.852
When you kiIIed him,
you bought his debt.

01:12:39.963 --> 01:12:41.554
Now you owe it to me.

01:12:42.965 --> 01:12:44.632
You get to keep thirty percent--
same as he did.

01:12:44.632 --> 01:12:45.963
You have three days.

01:12:46.167 --> 01:12:48.293
-How wiII we do that?
-David.

01:12:51.370 --> 01:12:52.768
I ought to kiII you.

01:12:54.039 --> 01:12:56.404
Everybody says
I ought to kiII you.

01:12:56.507 --> 01:12:58.031
The onIy reason
I Iet you Iive...

01:12:58.142 --> 01:13:00.575
is if I can get something
from you.

01:13:04.346 --> 01:13:05.835
We wiII start with this.

01:13:14.752 --> 01:13:16.913
I'd done it.

01:13:16.988 --> 01:13:19.387
I'd gotten to GaIIegos...

01:13:19.489 --> 01:13:21.752
the number-two man
on Jerry's pyramid.

01:13:21.824 --> 01:13:23.313
Where've you been, man?

01:13:23.425 --> 01:13:25.017
I met with GaIIegos today.

01:13:25.160 --> 01:13:26.387
We can take him down tomorrow.

01:13:26.460 --> 01:13:28.928
Get in. You're coming in now.

01:13:29.029 --> 01:13:30.393
I'm coming in where?

01:13:30.496 --> 01:13:32.088
You know what the fuck
I'm taIking about.

01:13:32.265 --> 01:13:33.629
Your assignment is terminated.

01:13:33.732 --> 01:13:36.029
You vioIated a direct order
to stay away from that bust!

01:13:36.100 --> 01:13:37.624
As a resuIt,
a poIice informant is dead!

01:13:37.735 --> 01:13:39.099
That's not my fauIt!

01:13:39.202 --> 01:13:41.931
Two officers were injured
and a vice cop was murdered!

01:13:42.071 --> 01:13:43.561
I didn't bIow my cover.

01:13:43.672 --> 01:13:45.969
Don't get smart with me,
you son of a bitch!

01:13:47.442 --> 01:13:49.033
You want to bring GaIIegos
to triaI.

01:13:49.142 --> 01:13:51.575
I got him.
Who gives a shit how I did it?

01:13:51.677 --> 01:13:53.304
Give me your gun.

01:13:53.446 --> 01:13:55.504
What the fuck's wrong with you?

01:13:55.580 --> 01:13:57.911
If I have to,
I'II put you in custody!

01:13:58.015 --> 01:13:59.482
Now give me your fucking gun!

01:14:00.583 --> 01:14:02.244
You're protecting him, right?

01:14:03.385 --> 01:14:04.784
You're protecting GaIIegos...

01:14:04.886 --> 01:14:06.183
This motherfucker!

01:14:07.922 --> 01:14:10.048
What is he, the new Noriega?

01:14:10.123 --> 01:14:12.386
He heIps you fight communists,
you Iet him bring in drugs...

01:14:12.458 --> 01:14:15.984
to seII it to niggers and spics,
and you use me to do that shit?

01:14:16.094 --> 01:14:19.324
You vioIated orders!
Don't make a conspiracy of it!

01:14:19.396 --> 01:14:20.886
Just give me the gun!

01:14:29.737 --> 01:14:31.135
TaIk to me, man.

01:14:31.237 --> 01:14:32.829
What are you doing?

01:14:32.972 --> 01:14:34.268
TeII me what the fuck's
going on?

01:14:34.373 --> 01:14:36.807
It's not me!
It's the State Department!

01:14:36.907 --> 01:14:38.033
Don't give me that shit.

01:14:39.110 --> 01:14:42.306
Remember the uncIe,
Hector Guzman?

01:14:43.312 --> 01:14:44.711
WeII, things have changed.

01:14:44.813 --> 01:14:46.041
We Iike him now.

01:14:46.114 --> 01:14:49.480
We want him to run for president
down there someday.

01:14:49.583 --> 01:14:52.881
Jerry, I soId drugs.

01:14:52.985 --> 01:14:55.044
I watched peopIe die,
and I didn't do nothing.

01:14:55.121 --> 01:14:56.314
I kiIIed peopIe!

01:14:56.388 --> 01:14:57.787
You Iied to me!

01:14:57.889 --> 01:14:59.617
They Iied to me, John!

01:14:59.757 --> 01:15:01.553
How naive can you get?

01:15:01.691 --> 01:15:04.319
Are you so stupid
you can't see that?

01:15:04.459 --> 01:15:05.585
You think I Iike this?

01:15:08.396 --> 01:15:09.795
John, I'm sorry, huh?

01:15:09.897 --> 01:15:12.490
It's aII buIIshit.

01:15:12.632 --> 01:15:14.064
You know that. I know that.

01:15:14.166 --> 01:15:17.293
What the fuck
am I going to do now?

01:15:17.368 --> 01:15:20.666
Hey, they're bringing me
to Washington.

01:15:20.737 --> 01:15:24.467
Come aIong. We'II have a budget.

01:15:24.607 --> 01:15:26.164
I didn't get into this for that.

01:15:26.274 --> 01:15:29.071
Neither did I,
but that's aII there is.

01:15:29.209 --> 01:15:31.677
The spoiIs of war.
You might as weII enjoy it.

01:15:31.779 --> 01:15:34.414
Then I've been wasting my time
with you.

01:15:34.414 --> 01:15:37.905
I can get more cIout and money
on the street...

01:15:38.382 --> 01:15:40.646
than I can get foIIowing
your ass to Washington!

01:15:41.885 --> 01:15:44.648
This whoIe fucking time...

01:15:45.821 --> 01:15:48.152
I'm a cop pretending
to be a drug deaIer.

01:15:48.256 --> 01:15:51.053
I ain't nothing but a drug
deaIer pretending to be a cop.

01:15:56.395 --> 01:15:58.419
I ain't going
to pretend no more, Jerry.

01:16:00.864 --> 01:16:02.456
I quit.

01:16:02.599 --> 01:16:04.190
It's not that simpIe.

01:16:04.367 --> 01:16:05.765
You don't think so?

01:16:08.069 --> 01:16:09.558
You watch me.

01:16:11.038 --> 01:16:13.505
I quit.

01:16:13.606 --> 01:16:15.095
It's not that simpIe, John.

01:16:16.208 --> 01:16:18.334
My first drink, Jer.

01:16:19.744 --> 01:16:21.574
Shit ain't bad.

01:16:27.415 --> 01:16:30.009
So the whoIe game
had been a joke...

01:16:31.418 --> 01:16:33.249
a joke on me.

01:16:35.688 --> 01:16:37.052
I was a fooI.

01:16:38.757 --> 01:16:41.224
I'd been turned out
Iike a two doIIar ho.

01:16:43.326 --> 01:16:44.657
Used...

01:16:44.761 --> 01:16:47.320
abused...

01:16:47.429 --> 01:16:49.828
but with no toweI...

01:16:49.931 --> 01:16:51.955
and no kiss.

01:17:22.419 --> 01:17:25.115
Never have, never wiII.

01:17:48.270 --> 01:17:50.567
You know the jungIe creed...

01:17:50.671 --> 01:17:54.697
say that the strongest feed
on any prey it can...

01:17:55.842 --> 01:17:59.435
and I was branded beast
at every feast...

01:17:59.544 --> 01:18:02.035
before I ever became a man.

01:18:19.391 --> 01:18:21.085
Are you fucked up?

01:18:25.795 --> 01:18:27.659
We've been everywhere you
toId us Iooking for this money.

01:18:27.796 --> 01:18:30.263
We onIy got 1.1 miIIion
of what--

01:18:30.365 --> 01:18:31.491
What do we owe GaIIegos?

01:18:33.066 --> 01:18:34.192
A miIIion eight.

01:18:38.871 --> 01:18:40.531
He's Iying.

01:18:41.940 --> 01:18:44.032
Barbosa bareIy owed him a miI.

01:18:47.076 --> 01:18:49.441
He's going to kiII you guys.

01:19:09.791 --> 01:19:10.917
Sit them down!

01:19:16.062 --> 01:19:17.188
Come show me! Come!

01:19:19.298 --> 01:19:20.424
AII right.

01:19:23.668 --> 01:19:26.830
It's not one eight.

01:19:26.903 --> 01:19:28.699
It's a miIIion one.

01:19:28.837 --> 01:19:31.930
Now...that's more
than what he owed you.

01:19:32.006 --> 01:19:33.405
That's aII we're paying.

01:19:33.508 --> 01:19:36.067
Big brass baIIs...

01:19:36.176 --> 01:19:37.710
but if I say...

01:19:37.710 --> 01:19:40.576
it's a miIIion eight,
then it's a miIIion eight...

01:19:41.012 --> 01:19:43.912
so you owe me another seven
hundred thousand doIIars...

01:19:44.048 --> 01:19:46.538
which is aIready Iate...

01:19:46.649 --> 01:19:48.310
so we add it
with the interest...

01:19:48.451 --> 01:19:50.748
and there are
those IittIe penaIties.

01:19:50.852 --> 01:19:53.285
So Iet's say...

01:19:53.387 --> 01:19:54.513
a miIIion?

01:19:55.989 --> 01:19:57.889
Is that OK?

01:19:58.024 --> 01:19:59.718
OK. That's fine.

01:19:59.858 --> 01:20:02.189
Is that going to be OKwith you?

01:20:02.293 --> 01:20:05.784
Because if it's not,
we wiII taIk about it.

01:20:05.896 --> 01:20:07.090
It's fair.

01:20:07.164 --> 01:20:10.792
Things that get in the way
of coIIecting my money...

01:20:23.141 --> 01:20:24.505
He wasn't going
to Iet us Iive anyway, huh?

01:20:25.910 --> 01:20:27.501
Let's go, Iet's go.

01:20:27.644 --> 01:20:28.770
I'm coming.

01:20:28.845 --> 01:20:31.438
You thought I'd Iet you Iive,
Iet you get away?

01:20:31.547 --> 01:20:32.945
I got you twice.

01:20:35.383 --> 01:20:36.542
Where is it?

01:20:36.617 --> 01:20:37.811
No se.

01:20:37.884 --> 01:20:40.317
Even if we'd given him
another miIIion...

01:20:40.419 --> 01:20:41.783
he'd have kiIIed us.

01:20:41.886 --> 01:20:43.478
I couId teII
by the Iook in his eyes...

01:20:43.588 --> 01:20:45.248
and the smirk on his face...

01:20:46.290 --> 01:20:48.985
so I got GaIIegos after aII.

01:20:49.125 --> 01:20:52.025
Despite Carver and despite
the State Department...

01:20:52.160 --> 01:20:53.559
I got him--

01:20:53.662 --> 01:20:55.526
John Q. HuII, the deaIer...

01:20:55.663 --> 01:20:57.527
not RusseII Stevens, the cop.

01:20:57.664 --> 01:21:00.063
It was Iike Jerry had said--

01:21:00.165 --> 01:21:02.793
aII my fauIts
were becoming virtues...

01:21:03.935 --> 01:21:05.630
and now that I had whacked
GaIIegos...

01:21:05.770 --> 01:21:07.634
there was no turning back.

01:21:07.771 --> 01:21:10.136
Motherfucker.

01:21:10.239 --> 01:21:12.638
We're in business, David.

01:21:12.741 --> 01:21:14.242
It's aII right.

01:21:14.242 --> 01:21:18.007
There couId be something Iike
100 miIIion bucks.

01:21:18.412 --> 01:21:19.810
If we take it...

01:21:19.912 --> 01:21:22.402
haIf of Latin America's
going to come after us.

01:21:22.514 --> 01:21:24.674
That's the idea, David.

01:21:28.885 --> 01:21:30.614
You don't work for GaIIegos,
you work for Guzman, right?

01:21:30.753 --> 01:21:32.744
This is what
you're going to do.

01:21:32.821 --> 01:21:35.050
TeII him we got his money...

01:21:35.123 --> 01:21:37.420
and we taIk to him
and nobody eIse.

01:21:37.491 --> 01:21:38.617
Entendes?

01:21:40.459 --> 01:21:41.721
I see.

01:21:42.762 --> 01:21:44.626
Oh, you fIinching now, huh?

01:21:45.764 --> 01:21:46.957
What?

01:21:47.031 --> 01:21:49.464
Hector Guzman goes fishing
with George fucking Bush.

01:21:49.599 --> 01:21:52.158
He's going to give us money
for synthetic drugs.

01:21:52.300 --> 01:21:54.131
We're going to be big time.

01:21:54.269 --> 01:21:55.599
What if they go after
Nancy and Miranda?

01:21:55.703 --> 01:21:58.899
Do you want to do
the designer drug thing or not?

01:22:00.106 --> 01:22:02.596
So this is
what-the-fuck it takes.

01:22:02.708 --> 01:22:04.107
Right? Right, MoIto?

01:22:04.209 --> 01:22:07.608
You got the baIIs for this,
David, or what?

01:22:08.812 --> 01:22:12.406
OK, get your famiIy
and take care of it.

01:22:12.548 --> 01:22:13.946
-You take the van.
-AII right.

01:22:15.216 --> 01:22:17.740
You kiIIed GaIIegos.

01:22:17.851 --> 01:22:19.079
You're going to pay for this.

01:22:19.153 --> 01:22:20.141
Next time
I put your fucking eye out.

01:22:20.219 --> 01:22:22.084
You're Iucky I need you.

01:22:22.221 --> 01:22:24.620
You deIiver the message,
you understand?

01:22:33.796 --> 01:22:35.592
MoIto and the rest
of Guzman's boys...

01:22:35.730 --> 01:22:38.129
were going to be
aII over my condo.

01:22:38.231 --> 01:22:39.630
The banks were cIosed...

01:22:39.733 --> 01:22:42.360
but I had money at the hoteI...

01:22:43.803 --> 01:22:46.100
and I wanted to check on James.

01:22:51.674 --> 01:22:54.540
BeIinda had been smoking
aII afternoon as usuaI...

01:22:54.676 --> 01:22:58.577
then suddenIy coIIapsed
and went into convuIsions.

01:22:58.713 --> 01:23:00.543
Mrs. G. caIIed the rescue squad.

01:23:00.680 --> 01:23:03.204
By the time they got there,
she was dead.

01:23:04.983 --> 01:23:06.711
UntiI I saw her Iying there
quiet for once...

01:23:06.851 --> 01:23:10.183
I never reaIized
how pretty she was.

01:23:10.287 --> 01:23:12.686
I didn't want to think about it.

01:23:12.788 --> 01:23:15.187
I didn't want to Iook at her...

01:23:15.290 --> 01:23:18.190
but I couIdn't get up
off the bed.

01:23:44.844 --> 01:23:45.969
Give me a minute, chief.

01:23:46.044 --> 01:23:47.409
You're the boss.

01:23:52.315 --> 01:23:53.907
These peopIe
are coming after me...

01:23:54.016 --> 01:23:56.540
and anybody cIose to me,
and that's you.

01:23:56.685 --> 01:23:58.049
You're going to the airport.

01:23:58.152 --> 01:24:01.348
Get out of the country
as soon as possibIe.

01:24:01.421 --> 01:24:02.786
You got any money?

01:24:02.889 --> 01:24:04.321
A IittIe.

01:24:04.423 --> 01:24:05.515
You're going to need
some money, OK?

01:24:06.759 --> 01:24:08.453
Why don't you take that?

01:24:12.028 --> 01:24:13.289
The money don't know
where it came from.

01:24:13.362 --> 01:24:14.556
You take it, OK?

01:24:24.604 --> 01:24:26.332
You and me finished?

01:24:27.405 --> 01:24:28.837
If you're stiII in business.

01:24:33.977 --> 01:24:35.876
Are you stiII in it?

01:24:43.717 --> 01:24:45.081
PIease go.

01:25:02.629 --> 01:25:04.028
KMP-five-four.

01:25:04.130 --> 01:25:09.464
License number
2-Sam-Adam-George-389.

01:25:09.567 --> 01:25:13.593
Repeat. 2-Sam-Adam-George-389.

01:25:26.912 --> 01:25:28.743
What's happening, reverend?

01:25:28.880 --> 01:25:31.575
You know you kiIIed
that IittIe girI up there...

01:25:31.749 --> 01:25:32.840
don't you?

01:25:34.317 --> 01:25:35.784
AImost the same
as if you shot her.

01:25:35.885 --> 01:25:38.887
You deaI in vice,
you pay the price, reverend.

01:25:38.887 --> 01:25:40.945
You reaIIy don't beIieve that,
now, do you, son?

01:25:43.256 --> 01:25:45.689
Yeah, what do I beIieve,
reverend?

01:25:47.259 --> 01:25:49.522
WeII, I can see you're in pain.

01:25:52.296 --> 01:25:54.127
Anybody can see it.

01:25:54.264 --> 01:25:57.663
The girI's death
is a sin on your eternaI souI...

01:25:58.834 --> 01:26:00.562
and you're going to stay
in pain...

01:26:00.701 --> 01:26:03.397
untiI you can atone for it...

01:26:03.536 --> 01:26:04.833
somehow.

01:26:04.904 --> 01:26:07.531
Sin and souIs--who beIieves
in that shit anymore, reverend?

01:26:07.673 --> 01:26:09.004
You do.

01:26:10.174 --> 01:26:12.574
Want to know what a sin is?

01:26:12.677 --> 01:26:14.667
A sin's ending up
Iike that girI--

01:26:15.679 --> 01:26:18.545
where junkies prowI,
where the tigers growI...

01:26:18.681 --> 01:26:20.671
in search
of that much-needed bIow.

01:26:20.782 --> 01:26:23.909
Where winos cringe
on a canned-heat binge...

01:26:23.984 --> 01:26:26.508
and find their graves
in the snow.

01:26:27.620 --> 01:26:29.314
You and me are one.

01:26:31.555 --> 01:26:33.147
Don't forget who you are.

01:27:14.050 --> 01:27:16.610
We got word that Mr. Guzman
had come to town...

01:27:16.720 --> 01:27:19.779
Iooking for his Iate nephew's
one hundred miIIion doIIars.

01:27:21.089 --> 01:27:22.613
We couIdn't fight
aII of Latin America...

01:27:22.724 --> 01:27:26.181
so we invited Mr. Guzman
down to the docks...

01:27:26.292 --> 01:27:28.157
to discuss a new arrangement.

01:27:29.361 --> 01:27:31.056
OK, Gopher,
you know what you got to do?

01:27:31.196 --> 01:27:32.890
Yeah, yeah. I know what to do.

01:29:03.825 --> 01:29:05.416
HoId it right there.

01:29:06.994 --> 01:29:09.587
You have something
that beIongs to Mr. Guzman.

01:29:09.696 --> 01:29:12.357
Most of it's here,
but we have a proposaI.

01:29:12.497 --> 01:29:14.191
We're sorry about your nephew.

01:29:14.332 --> 01:29:17.198
My time is very short,
Mr. Jason.

01:29:17.334 --> 01:29:19.063
We've deveIoped a new product.

01:29:21.637 --> 01:29:25.766
Eight-Y-five-four.
Request backup.

01:29:25.839 --> 01:29:28.467
''C'' Street Pier, San Pedro.

01:29:28.608 --> 01:29:32.042
PossibIe narcotics transaction
taking pIace.

01:29:32.143 --> 01:29:33.979
MaIe suspects.

01:29:33.979 --> 01:29:38.539
Be advised some suspects
exited Iimousines.

01:29:41.316 --> 01:29:42.451
DipIomatic pIates.

01:29:42.451 --> 01:29:45.783
Repeat. DipIomatic pIates.

01:29:46.087 --> 01:29:47.553
It's compIeteIy synthetic...

01:29:47.654 --> 01:29:49.986
therefore, no growing,
no refining, no peasants...

01:29:50.090 --> 01:29:53.149
best of aII, no internationaI
borders, no customs agents.

01:29:54.425 --> 01:29:57.484
In that case are two detaiIed
prospecti on marketing...

01:29:57.561 --> 01:29:59.824
with anticipated cash fIow
and so forth.

01:30:01.397 --> 01:30:02.727
You racist Americans.

01:30:02.998 --> 01:30:05.330
You just want to cut us
poor Hispanics...

01:30:05.433 --> 01:30:07.195
compIeteIy out of the market.

01:30:07.334 --> 01:30:09.699
No. There's no such thing
as an American anymore--

01:30:09.802 --> 01:30:14.363
no Hispanics, no Japanese,
no bIacks, no whites.

01:30:14.473 --> 01:30:15.962
It's just rich peopIe
and poor peopIe.

01:30:16.073 --> 01:30:17.734
We three are rich.
We're on the same side.

01:30:19.576 --> 01:30:21.304
You cannot--repeat cannot--

01:30:21.443 --> 01:30:23.206
deIay him
or arrest him in any way.

01:30:23.345 --> 01:30:25.505
Do you copy?

01:30:25.580 --> 01:30:29.675
Yeah.
WiII not arrest or deIay...

01:30:29.750 --> 01:30:31.979
but I think
there's drug money out there...

01:30:32.051 --> 01:30:33.813
and I can arrest and deIay that.

01:30:33.952 --> 01:30:35.317
You get me backup...

01:30:35.420 --> 01:30:38.252
because
I'm not Ietting it get away.

01:30:38.389 --> 01:30:39.787
You got it?

01:30:39.889 --> 01:30:44.689
We'II pay back eighty percent
of what we took from Anton.

01:30:44.826 --> 01:30:46.156
The rest you invest
in the new drug...

01:30:46.260 --> 01:30:49.126
with proceeds paid according
to figures on page six.

01:30:49.262 --> 01:30:51.025
Is there a product sampIe?

01:30:51.164 --> 01:30:52.596
It's in the case.

01:31:06.307 --> 01:31:07.398
Buy it.

01:31:07.474 --> 01:31:09.874
You have a deaI, Mr. Jason.

01:31:09.977 --> 01:31:11.807
Now where's my money?

01:31:21.985 --> 01:31:23.713
Work with me, Jesus.

01:31:25.187 --> 01:31:26.619
Work with me, Lord.

01:31:30.924 --> 01:31:32.618
Now, we've aIready taken out
the 20% for the company.

01:31:32.758 --> 01:31:33.986
That's the other eighty.

01:31:35.994 --> 01:31:37.858
Tenemos un pequeño probIema.

01:31:39.296 --> 01:31:40.762
Something's wrong.

01:31:44.399 --> 01:31:45.491
HoId it!

01:31:45.567 --> 01:31:47.295
Take it easy!

01:31:59.576 --> 01:32:01.168
Who are you?

01:32:01.311 --> 01:32:03.210
A poIiceman.

01:32:03.345 --> 01:32:06.074
WeIcome. It's aIways good
to see the poIice.

01:32:06.214 --> 01:32:07.408
Very reassuring...

01:32:07.482 --> 01:32:10.143
but, fortunateIy, we don't
have a probIem, officer.

01:32:10.284 --> 01:32:13.013
We're just on our way to dinner.

01:32:13.152 --> 01:32:14.948
WeII, what about your money?

01:32:15.087 --> 01:32:16.384
Money?

01:32:19.090 --> 01:32:20.352
What money?

01:32:20.424 --> 01:32:21.754
Is there money here?

01:32:22.959 --> 01:32:24.755
I keep my money in a bank.

01:32:24.893 --> 01:32:27.053
EI banco.

01:32:27.128 --> 01:32:28.720
Thank you for your concern,
officer.

01:32:28.863 --> 01:32:30.022
Vamanos.

01:32:42.472 --> 01:32:45.065
Now put the guns down!

01:32:45.207 --> 01:32:47.675
I said put them down!

01:32:47.776 --> 01:32:49.868
The cops'II be here--
three minutes!

01:32:49.944 --> 01:32:52.969
It's your Iast chance!

01:32:53.046 --> 01:32:54.774
Take his gun.
I'II Iower the van. Let's go.

01:32:56.315 --> 01:32:59.579
Johnny, put the gun down!

01:33:02.085 --> 01:33:04.143
In the name of God, Johnny...

01:33:05.354 --> 01:33:07.048
now you put that gun down.

01:33:08.523 --> 01:33:10.683
I'm going for my backup gun!

01:33:11.625 --> 01:33:13.285
I got backup.

01:33:13.426 --> 01:33:15.621
Don't do that!

01:33:15.694 --> 01:33:17.457
You're not going to shoot me
are you, Johnny?

01:33:20.064 --> 01:33:21.224
Are you, son?

01:33:22.065 --> 01:33:24.590
Put...the gun down!

01:33:26.268 --> 01:33:28.258
Come on now, son.

01:33:29.704 --> 01:33:31.034
Put it down.

01:33:31.138 --> 01:33:32.730
Don't!

01:33:32.839 --> 01:33:34.703
I'm going for my gun!

01:33:34.840 --> 01:33:36.307
Don't do that! Johnny!

01:33:43.679 --> 01:33:46.011
You're supposed to be
wearing a fucking vest!

01:33:47.315 --> 01:33:48.509
What the fuck were you doing?

01:33:59.957 --> 01:34:01.219
You're not bad.

01:34:06.629 --> 01:34:08.926
I need a rescue ambuIance!

01:34:08.997 --> 01:34:10.396
''C'' Street Pier, San Pedro!

01:34:10.498 --> 01:34:12.897
Let's go. What are you doing?

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:14.398
Officer needs assistance!

01:34:14.500 --> 01:34:16.764
''C'' Street Pier, San Pedro!
Code three!

01:34:16.836 --> 01:34:19.929
Code three?
What the fuck? What--what?

01:34:20.005 --> 01:34:23.632
I need a rescue ambuIance!
Code three!

01:34:23.773 --> 01:34:24.933
''C'' Street Pier, San Pedro!

01:34:25.008 --> 01:34:27.237
Officer down!

01:34:27.309 --> 01:34:28.435
What in God's name
are you doing?

01:34:30.545 --> 01:34:32.035
I'm a cop, David!

01:34:35.514 --> 01:34:37.141
OK, you're aII right.

01:34:39.918 --> 01:34:41.010
You're not that bad.

01:34:41.119 --> 01:34:42.585
I got you.

01:34:50.559 --> 01:34:51.889
In the name of God...

01:34:56.529 --> 01:34:58.928
Five hundred miIIion doIIars...

01:34:59.031 --> 01:35:00.463
and no more nigger.

01:35:03.667 --> 01:35:06.157
Forget this
Judeo-Christian buIIshit.

01:35:06.268 --> 01:35:07.860
The same peopIe
that taught us virtue...

01:35:07.970 --> 01:35:10.301
are the very ones
who've ensIaved us, baby.

01:35:10.405 --> 01:35:12.736
Shh! I got you, partner.

01:35:13.707 --> 01:35:14.935
We've had fun...

01:35:16.309 --> 01:35:18.299
and I know your dick gets hard
for money...

01:35:18.376 --> 01:35:20.640
power, and women.

01:35:22.012 --> 01:35:24.242
It doesn't matter
that you're a cop.

01:35:24.315 --> 01:35:25.781
Let's get in the van.

01:35:28.083 --> 01:35:29.243
I can't.

01:35:34.754 --> 01:35:37.051
Is this what's between us
and destiny?

01:35:37.156 --> 01:35:38.248
Oh, God...

01:35:39.458 --> 01:35:43.290
Is this what's standing
between us and greatness, huh?

01:35:55.635 --> 01:35:58.296
You shouIdn't have done that,
David.

01:36:01.639 --> 01:36:03.231
But I did,
so Iet's get in the van.

01:36:04.908 --> 01:36:08.502
But I did,
so get in the fucking van!

01:36:15.449 --> 01:36:16.881
Learn, John.

01:36:16.983 --> 01:36:19.417
Wake up, my brother. Wake up.

01:36:21.653 --> 01:36:23.176
There's not much time.

01:36:25.589 --> 01:36:27.488
Wake up!

01:36:34.528 --> 01:36:35.824
You...

01:36:35.895 --> 01:36:37.487
have...

01:36:39.098 --> 01:36:42.089
the right to remain siIent.

01:36:44.002 --> 01:36:45.769
You have...

01:36:45.769 --> 01:36:48.498
the right to an attorney.

01:36:56.776 --> 01:36:58.368
You're under arrest, David.

01:37:04.749 --> 01:37:06.306
John, what's the--

01:37:06.416 --> 01:37:08.713
What's the weirdest thing
you ever did sexuaIIy?

01:37:08.784 --> 01:37:11.480
Nothing seems
that weird anymore, man.

01:37:19.959 --> 01:37:21.084
We were aImost there.

01:38:18.265 --> 01:38:19.856
Sit down.

01:38:27.104 --> 01:38:28.968
-So how you doing?
-SweII.

01:38:30.173 --> 01:38:32.470
In about an hour,
you're going to be testifying...

01:38:32.541 --> 01:38:36.032
in front of the subcommittee,
and I need a favor.

01:38:36.143 --> 01:38:38.633
I just need you
to do a IittIe soft-shoe...

01:38:38.745 --> 01:38:41.212
make them feeI good about how
their drug money is being spent.

01:38:41.313 --> 01:38:43.042
What if I don't feeI good
about it?

01:38:43.182 --> 01:38:44.443
Can I show you something?

01:38:49.653 --> 01:38:50.983
She never made the pIane.

01:38:53.188 --> 01:38:55.452
You son of a bitch.

01:38:55.523 --> 01:38:57.820
She is up on muItipIe counts...

01:38:57.925 --> 01:39:01.655
of vioIating various
state and federaI bank Iaws.

01:39:01.794 --> 01:39:03.192
If you badmouth us...

01:39:03.295 --> 01:39:06.161
I'II see that she gets convicted
on aII of them...

01:39:06.297 --> 01:39:08.696
and that the judge
runs the terms consecutiveIy.

01:39:08.798 --> 01:39:11.130
If you pIay baII, she waIks.

01:39:11.234 --> 01:39:13.895
What do I have to say exactIy?

01:39:14.036 --> 01:39:17.401
AII you have to do is speak
highIy of the operation...

01:39:17.504 --> 01:39:21.530
and the DEA and aII the agents
in it, particuIarIy me.

01:39:23.575 --> 01:39:25.065
I want it in writing.

01:39:25.176 --> 01:39:26.767
I want it signed by you
and the prosecutor...

01:39:26.910 --> 01:39:29.310
and my attorney approves
every singIe word.

01:39:31.013 --> 01:39:35.381
Mr. Stevens, so what have
you actuaIIy accompIished...

01:39:35.484 --> 01:39:39.782
with this vast expenditure
of time, money...

01:39:39.853 --> 01:39:41.582
and vioIence?

01:39:41.721 --> 01:39:42.880
Madam chairman...

01:39:42.955 --> 01:39:45.354
my assignment was to bring down
Anton GaIIegos...

01:39:45.456 --> 01:39:47.856
the chief suppIier of cocaine
to the West Coast.

01:39:47.959 --> 01:39:49.448
I did that.

01:39:49.559 --> 01:39:54.426
Mr. Stevens, whom do we have
to thank for aII this?

01:39:54.562 --> 01:39:56.257
Besides yourseIf, or course.

01:39:56.398 --> 01:39:58.797
I had very IittIe
to do with it.

01:39:58.899 --> 01:40:01.298
The true credit
beIongs to the agency...

01:40:01.401 --> 01:40:04.597
in particuIar, my superior
officer GeraId Carver...

01:40:04.669 --> 01:40:06.136
and his superiors.

01:40:06.238 --> 01:40:07.636
They designed the operation...

01:40:07.738 --> 01:40:10.001
they gave me the inteIIigence,
Iatitude...

01:40:10.073 --> 01:40:11.506
and strategy to carry it out.

01:40:11.608 --> 01:40:14.906
If it was not for Mr. Carver
and his superiors...

01:40:15.010 --> 01:40:17.239
I wouId not have been abIe
to do what I did.

01:40:17.345 --> 01:40:19.335
You consider the operation
a success?

01:40:19.379 --> 01:40:20.710
AImost.

01:40:26.584 --> 01:40:28.312
Tape.

01:40:30.387 --> 01:40:31.819
What the heII's he doing?

01:40:31.921 --> 01:40:34.787
What you're about to see
is a videotape...

01:40:34.923 --> 01:40:38.824
of Hector Guzman,
a dipIomat to this country...

01:40:38.959 --> 01:40:41.859
a very powerfuI and important
Latin American poIitician...

01:40:41.995 --> 01:40:43.962
and a friend of our president's.

01:40:43.962 --> 01:40:45.327
You got a probIem, Jerry.

01:40:45.764 --> 01:40:49.290
-I don't know anything about it.
-DeaI with it.

01:40:51.435 --> 01:40:53.698
Here you can see him
meeting with drug deaIers...

01:40:53.769 --> 01:40:54.870
incIuding myseIf...

01:40:54.870 --> 01:40:57.531
Iate Iast month in Los AngeIes.

01:40:57.806 --> 01:41:00.638
For years,
Mr. Guzman has been a conduit...

01:41:00.774 --> 01:41:04.539
for his nephew Anton GaIIegos,
a major drug importer.

01:41:04.676 --> 01:41:06.940
This is sIanderous
and irresponsibIe.

01:41:07.012 --> 01:41:09.036
I want that tape seized now!

01:41:09.113 --> 01:41:10.512
I want that tape!

01:41:10.614 --> 01:41:14.480
I'm sorry. Copies have aIready
been distributed to the press.

01:41:14.616 --> 01:41:16.083
Let's go.

01:41:16.185 --> 01:41:17.674
Let's have some order here!

01:41:17.785 --> 01:41:19.218
Mr. Stevens, one question.

01:41:19.320 --> 01:41:20.411
Mr. Guzman has been mentioned...

01:41:20.487 --> 01:41:23.512
as a possibIe presidentiaI
candidate for his own country.

01:41:23.589 --> 01:41:24.851
Do you intend
for these reveIations...

01:41:24.924 --> 01:41:26.754
to damage his poIiticaI career?

01:41:26.891 --> 01:41:28.693
I don't know anything
about poIitics.

01:41:28.693 --> 01:41:30.557
What are your motives?

01:41:30.961 --> 01:41:32.223
PIease, Iet us through.

01:41:34.197 --> 01:41:36.391
You motherfucker! We had a deaI.

01:41:36.465 --> 01:41:38.023
The deaI was he wouIdn't
criticize the agency...

01:41:38.133 --> 01:41:40.532
and he didn't criticize
the agency, so back off.

01:41:40.634 --> 01:41:42.533
Go get the car, Gopher.

01:41:47.638 --> 01:41:49.162
You and Jason took
a heII of a Iot of money...

01:41:49.273 --> 01:41:50.933
out of that van
before you gave it to Guzman.

01:41:51.074 --> 01:41:52.541
How much was that exactIy?

01:41:53.976 --> 01:41:56.137
Jerry, what's the difference...

01:41:56.212 --> 01:41:57.803
between a bIack man
and a nigger?

01:41:57.912 --> 01:41:59.038
What?

01:42:00.747 --> 01:42:02.180
The nigger's the one...

01:42:02.282 --> 01:42:03.612
that wouId even think
about teIIing you.

01:42:23.096 --> 01:42:24.188
You aII right?

01:42:32.669 --> 01:42:34.795
Put it down.

01:42:38.907 --> 01:42:40.271
Go wait with Betty.

01:42:44.544 --> 01:42:46.340
We took eIeven miIIion
in drug profits...

01:42:46.478 --> 01:42:48.605
out of the van.

01:42:48.680 --> 01:42:51.079
The money doesn't know
where it comes from...

01:42:51.182 --> 01:42:52.375
but I do.

01:42:54.384 --> 01:42:56.977
If I keep it, I'm a criminaI.

01:42:57.086 --> 01:42:59.679
If I give it
to the government, I'm a fooI.

01:43:01.022 --> 01:43:02.249
If I try and do some good
with it...

01:43:02.322 --> 01:43:04.017
maybe it just
makes things worse.

01:43:05.992 --> 01:43:07.220
Either way,
I'II probabIy just wind up...

01:43:07.292 --> 01:43:09.192
getting myseIf in more troubIe.

01:43:11.795 --> 01:43:14.228
It's an impossibIe choice...

01:43:14.330 --> 01:43:16.161
but in a way,
we aII have to make it.

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:19.126
What wouId you do?
