that will make true progress

24:05.958 --> 24:09.166
In collaboration with the CDC and the NIH,

24:09.250 --> 24:11.583
we are creating a strategic partnership

with BioPrime Pharmaceuticals.

24:13.833 --> 24:17.166
Thanks to the effort
of BioPrime CEO, Simon Keeley,

24:17.250 --> 24:19.000
and chairman, Vinod Shah,

24:19.083 --> 24:23.041
this bill will effectively cap
the cost of treatment.

Finally, many of BioPrime's
breakthrough treatments

24:27.250 --> 24:30.333
that used to cost
in the hundreds of thousands of dollars

24:30.416 --> 24:34.375
will now be available
to the public at affordable prices.

24:34.875 --> 24:36.208
I told the American people

24:36.291 --> 24:39.291
that I would hold companies
like BioPrime accountable,

24:39.375 --> 24:41.666
and I have delivered on that promise.

about that trip we took
with Mom in the woods.

tiny pieces of her every day, and I just…

and they didn't find anything.

You know those men were sent to kill us.

48:04.583 --> 48:06.000

they'll find us anywhere.

51:18.166 --> 51:21.333
It's gonna be okay, Rae.
I'm gonna keep you safe.

51:22.458 --> 51:24.083
They're coming to hurt you.

51:24.958 --> 51:27.958
That's why I need to stop this.
It needs to finish.

51:28.833 --> 51:30.041

51:30.125 --> 51:31.875

52:06.000 --> 52:08.333
No, but I need to be ready.

52:10.291 --> 52:13.166
Do you know how to shoot it?
It's not a hunting rifle.

52:13.250 --> 52:15.166
-[gun cocks]
-You know I do, Rae.

52:16.333 --> 52:17.916
So, what is your plan?

52:19.375 --> 52:20.541
[Ray sighs]

52:21.375 --> 52:24.208
It's better to have it and not need it
than need it and not have it.

52:25.083 --> 52:26.541
We need protection.

52:27.208 --> 52:30.291
Okay, so all the values
you taught me growing up

52:30.375 --> 52:31.958
are out the window?

Rachel?

53:24.250 --> 53:26.750
I don't know who.
I don't know what he's gonna do, but…

53:26.833 --> 53:28.041
Who, your dad?

53:28.708 --> 53:30.833
Look, I've been tryin' to stop him,
but I can't.

53:31.333 --> 53:34.041
The only person
he would ever listen to is my mom.

53:34.708 --> 53:37.916
-Can you tell me about her?
-She…

53:39.333 --> 53:40.625
She was a dancer.

53:41.708 --> 53:42.958
[sighs] She had, uh…

53:43.583 --> 53:46.458
tendinitis and stress fractures.

53:49.458 --> 53:53.125
My dad, I mean, he sparred
with guys who could take a punch.

53:54.416 --> 53:58.500
But you could tell that they were in pain.
You saw it. You know?

54:00.583 --> 54:02.625
But when my mom danced,

54:03.416 --> 54:04.916
she'd just smile.

54:05.916 --> 54:07.541
She always smiled.

54:07.625 --> 54:10.416
She's tough. Like you.

54:11.375 --> 54:12.458

54:23.375 --> 54:25.458
Well, I'm an FBI agent.

54:26.125 --> 54:27.916
I do have one question.

54:28.750 --> 54:31.166
Who is… Paloma?

54:32.500 --> 54:34.541
How do you know about Paloma?

54:34.625 --> 54:37.666
I'm looking at a photo
that says "Rachel and Paloma."

54:37.750 --> 54:39.750
[bright music playing]

54:41.833 --> 54:44.375
I… wanted a pet. [sighs]

54:45.541 --> 54:48.833
But we couldn't get one
because of my mom's treatments, so…

54:51.250 --> 54:53.333
so she got me a stuffed bunny.

54:55.625 --> 54:56.708
Paloma.

55:01.541 --> 55:02.708
[takes a deep breath]

55:02.791 --> 55:03.708
You…

55:04.833 --> 55:08.166
She was always, uh, looking out for me.

55:11.291 --> 55:13.125
Even when she couldn't. [sighs]

55:13.958 --> 55:15.500
You'd make her proud.

55:16.500 --> 55:17.541
And your dad.

[breathing shakily]

Um, but I'm… I'm not. I'm really not.

55:30.375 --> 55:32.958
-You are in control.
-Stop saying that.

55:33.041 --> 55:35.625
You are in control. You are Rachel Cooper.

I have to fight harder, so…

57:11.541 --> 57:12.541
What?

57:14.208 --> 57:16.041
[gently] I need you to get outta the car.

57:20.250 --> 57:21.416
Get outta the car.

As long as we're together,
we're still a family.

Okay? So if you can't promise me
that we'll be together,

You're responsible
for ordering the hit on Martin Bennett.

-[Morgan gasps]
-[firmly] Tell me the truth.

1:38:18.208 --> 1:38:19.166
[Morgan sighs]

1:38:20.041 --> 1:38:21.083
[scoffs]

1:38:21.583 --> 1:38:22.541
Yeah.

1:38:22.625 --> 1:38:24.791
[tense music playing]

1:38:24.875 --> 1:38:26.500
I took the bribe.

1:38:30.958 --> 1:38:31.875
I ordered the hit.

1:38:33.250 --> 1:38:34.291
[chuckles softly]

1:38:35.916 --> 1:38:38.583
You don't understand anything.
You're so young.

1:38:38.666 --> 1:38:40.583
[laughs]

1:38:40.666 --> 1:38:43.833
The candidate with the most money wins.

1:38:45.291 --> 1:38:47.000
That's how it works.

1:38:47.083 --> 1:38:49.083
[Rachel breathing shakily]

1:38:49.166 --> 1:38:51.166
[tense music building]

1:38:52.583 --> 1:38:53.916
Was it worth it?

1:38:56.208 --> 1:38:57.708
Was it worth it?

1:38:57.791 --> 1:38:59.000
[Morgan groans softly]

1:39:03.833 --> 1:39:04.833
[Rachel sobs softly]

1:39:15.833 --> 1:39:17.875
[music fades]

1:39:20.833 --> 1:39:21.833
[Morgan gasps]

1:39:22.583 --> 1:39:24.041
[breathing shakily]

1:39:27.125 --> 1:39:28.166
Security?

1:39:29.541 --> 1:39:30.708
[takes a deep breath]

1:39:31.208 --> 1:39:33.291
[yelling] Security!

1:39:38.458 --> 1:39:40.041
[Rachel panting]

1:39:47.750 --> 1:39:50.583
-[somber music playing]
-[sirens wailing in distance]

1:39:53.916 --> 1:39:55.375
[tires squealing]

1:39:57.083 --> 1:39:59.083
[indistinct chatter]

1:40:06.500 --> 1:40:07.458
[Rachel groaning]

1:40:14.166 --> 1:40:18.125
She kills Keeley and runs.
Tries to escape, but something or someone

1:40:18.208 --> 1:40:20.500
drove her back here,
despite knowing she might be caught.

1:40:20.583 --> 1:40:23.208
[Rothman] Yeah, but she got
her revenge. Why come back?

1:40:23.291 --> 1:40:24.916
-[agent] Just came in.
-Thank you, sir.

1:40:25.000 --> 1:40:26.125
[agent] You're welcome.

1:40:28.375 --> 1:40:30.125
-Holy shit.
-[Meeker] What?

1:40:33.291 --> 1:40:35.166
[Rothman] Rachel Cooper was spotted

1:40:35.250 --> 1:40:38.000
at Diana Morgan's campaign rally
yesterday afternoon.

1:40:39.583 --> 1:40:41.250
[Meeker] What was she doing there?

1:40:44.333 --> 1:40:47.458
[reporter on TV] The fugitive
from last night's assassination attempt…

1:40:47.541 --> 1:40:48.416
[Rachel] Thanks.

1:40:48.500 --> 1:40:50.208
…on Diana Morgan is still on the loose.

1:40:50.291 --> 1:40:52.750
Pittsburgh police are asking
anyone with information

1:40:52.833 --> 1:40:54.291
to please come forward.

1:40:54.375 --> 1:40:57.125
[Rothman] First Keeley,
then Shah, now a congresswoman?

1:40:58.333 --> 1:41:00.000
It just seems so bizarre.

1:41:00.750 --> 1:41:02.750
[Meeker] Rachel clearly knows something.

1:41:04.166 --> 1:41:07.125
Let's go through Diana Morgan's
campaign donations.

1:41:07.750 --> 1:41:08.833
[cell phone chimes]

1:41:08.916 --> 1:41:10.083
[computer alert chimes]

1:41:12.791 --> 1:41:15.750
[Meeker] Look at this.
Rachel Cooper just sent us something.

1:41:18.875 --> 1:41:22.708
[Morgan on recording]
I took the bribe. I ordered the hit.

1:41:24.041 --> 1:41:27.166
The candidate with the most money wins.

1:41:28.583 --> 1:41:29.583
That's how it works.

1:41:29.666 --> 1:41:32.666
[reporter on TV] …developments
in the assassination attempt.

1:41:32.750 --> 1:41:36.083
According to sources,
the FBI has arrested the congresswoman

1:41:36.166 --> 1:41:37.333
regarding her connection

1:41:37.416 --> 1:41:39.458
to the recent murders
of BioPrime executives

1:41:39.541 --> 1:41:41.666
Simon Keeley and Vinod Shah

1:41:41.750 --> 1:41:45.916
and the two-year-old unsolved murders
of Martin Bennett and Ray Cooper.

1:41:46.000 --> 1:41:50.416
Neither BioPrime or the FBI would
comment on this ongoing investigation.

1:41:50.500 --> 1:41:51.708
[soaring music playing]

1:41:51.791 --> 1:41:55.875
…Pennsylvania is allegedly connected
to the deaths of reporter Martin Bennett

1:41:55.958 --> 1:41:58.875
and Rachel Cooper's father
nearly two years ago.

1:41:58.958 --> 1:42:00.708
[Ray] The past is like a dream.

1:42:02.208 --> 1:42:05.166
A mosaic of images and feelings

1:42:05.250 --> 1:42:07.791
that offers some truth
about how we got here,

1:42:07.875 --> 1:42:10.291
even if details have blurred with time.

1:42:12.458 --> 1:42:14.291
Parents and their children.

1:42:15.125 --> 1:42:16.458
Where do we stop…

1:42:17.458 --> 1:42:18.916
[Rachel] …and they begin?

1:42:24.375 --> 1:42:27.125
[instrumental music continues playing]

1:45:37.791 --> 1:45:40.541
[somber instrumental music playing]
