WEBVTT

01:18.161 --> 01:19.412
Were you…

01:22.290 --> 01:23.958
with Woo-jae?

01:27.462 --> 01:30.715
Are you back together with Woo-jae?
Is that it?

01:36.763 --> 01:38.264
Just say something.

01:43.019 --> 01:44.687
<i>What should I say?</i>

01:45.980 --> 01:49.067
<i>If I said I'd been here all night,</i>

01:50.568 --> 01:52.070
<i>would you believe me?</i>

01:54.614 --> 01:58.201
Say something. Anything at all.

01:59.953 --> 02:04.624
<i>Or should I ask when you found out
and how much you know?</i>

02:06.209 --> 02:07.752
<i>And despite knowing it all,</i>

02:07.836 --> 02:11.005
<i>how were you able to treat me
no different from before?</i>

02:12.132 --> 02:14.259
<i>Should I ask
what your true intentions are?</i>

02:16.886 --> 02:18.721
Make an excuse at least.

02:25.436 --> 02:29.482
I can neither lie nor make an excuse.

02:33.486 --> 02:37.740
<i>I choose to say what I must
rather than what I want to say.</i>

02:38.992 --> 02:41.494
I know I was wrong.

02:44.622 --> 02:46.624
I can't be so shameless.

02:51.421 --> 02:53.089
It was foolish of me.

02:55.550 --> 02:58.052
I did something utterly terrible.

03:16.279 --> 03:17.822
It's all my fault.

03:18.907 --> 03:20.992
I'm the reason why
Hae-won kept following me

03:22.368 --> 03:24.412
and pestered you.

03:26.664 --> 03:30.793
I'm the reason why
she approached Li-sa and Ho-su.

03:36.674 --> 03:38.092
I'm to blame.

03:39.344 --> 03:41.012
It's all my fault.

03:41.888 --> 03:43.640
I ruined everything.

03:47.185 --> 03:48.353
Why did you do it?

03:49.771 --> 03:51.522
It was a mistake.

03:53.691 --> 03:56.319
Saying anything else would be an excuse.

03:56.402 --> 03:58.071
There was no reason.

04:00.281 --> 04:03.368
I've been atoning for what I did
to you and our kids.

04:04.410 --> 04:05.495
I regret it.

04:06.537 --> 04:08.289
I regret it every single day.

04:09.040 --> 04:11.834
I know that won't change anything,

04:12.585 --> 04:14.587
but please know this.

04:14.671 --> 04:18.216
If I could turn back time,
I'd do it at all costs.

04:23.721 --> 04:27.225
I know it's impossible to forgive me.
I would've felt the same.

04:39.612 --> 04:42.073
I'll do as you say.

04:45.285 --> 04:48.204
If you can't stand being around me,

04:49.539 --> 04:51.249
I'll leave.

05:06.306 --> 05:08.099
Are you alone? No one else came?

05:10.310 --> 05:11.352
Like who?

05:16.941 --> 05:18.234
Have you been here all day?

05:21.612 --> 05:22.947
I asked you a question.

05:24.532 --> 05:26.034
But you already know the answer.

05:29.996 --> 05:31.748
Why did you go to the hospital today?

05:32.540 --> 05:34.000
You didn't have an appointment.

05:38.379 --> 05:39.881
Did you meet with Hui-ju?

05:45.595 --> 05:47.430
What do you want me to do?

05:47.930 --> 05:49.974
Do you want me to break up with you?

05:51.100 --> 05:52.018
Is that it?

05:52.101 --> 05:54.854
If it was that easy,
you should've done it sooner.

05:56.272 --> 05:58.941
You've had many chances.

05:59.901 --> 06:02.070
Before registering our marriage
seven years ago,

06:02.153 --> 06:03.738
or before our wedding.

06:05.531 --> 06:08.785
But now, you say it
as if you're doing me a favor.

06:09.827 --> 06:11.788
You should've died back then.

06:15.333 --> 06:17.543
Then I wouldn't have resented you so much.

06:23.883 --> 06:24.926
But then again,

06:25.802 --> 06:28.346
you're not really who you used to be.

06:29.639 --> 06:31.682
You're as good as dead to me.

06:33.101 --> 06:34.769
I'm going to remember

06:35.561 --> 06:37.355
how I wronged you.

06:39.190 --> 06:41.734
And I'll ask
for your forgiveness until you finally do.

06:48.116 --> 06:51.911
It pains me that I can't even remember
what I need to apologize for.

06:56.332 --> 06:58.709
Watching you break down because of me…

07:01.003 --> 07:02.171
is torturous.

07:03.631 --> 07:04.841
Good.

07:07.385 --> 07:11.305
That's exactly why
I'm keeping both of you close.

07:17.770 --> 07:20.773
RICE & BAR

07:27.321 --> 07:29.866
When did you get here? He's waiting--

07:29.949 --> 07:31.242
He left.

07:33.244 --> 07:34.412
He did?

07:34.996 --> 07:36.205
Gosh.

07:37.248 --> 07:38.666
He ordered a drink

07:39.750 --> 07:42.253
and sat there for five hours straight.

07:43.921 --> 07:45.423
What an annoying customer.

07:46.674 --> 07:48.593
I'll drink twice as much next time.

07:52.889 --> 07:54.557
You look like you want a drink now.

07:55.683 --> 07:56.976
Is it that obvious?

08:02.398 --> 08:04.066
It doesn't feel so great

08:04.150 --> 08:06.611
to be someone whose existence…

08:08.696 --> 08:10.323
is torturous to another.

08:12.033 --> 08:15.828
I'm sure my grandpa didn't raise me
to become someone like this.

08:15.912 --> 08:18.581
You don't feel that great,
and the other is in pain.

08:19.332 --> 08:20.500
So why bother doing it?

08:23.586 --> 08:25.671
I can't help this rage inside me.

08:33.471 --> 08:36.641
Then relieve it like this.
Why let it grow?

08:37.808 --> 08:39.101
There's no cure for that.

08:44.398 --> 08:45.691
I'm so pathetic.

08:46.567 --> 08:48.694
How did I turn out like this?

08:49.320 --> 08:51.030
Don't you ever get mad at yourself

08:52.156 --> 08:53.533
or another person.

08:55.493 --> 08:58.162
It'll just eat away at yourself.

09:00.122 --> 09:01.707
I'm speaking from experience.

09:27.483 --> 09:32.321
<i>If you can't stand
being around me, I'll leave.</i>

10:00.558 --> 10:02.518
Please give me a bit of time.

10:06.856 --> 10:08.232
I'm sorry.

10:10.735 --> 10:11.944
I really am.

10:30.421 --> 10:33.633
I wouldn't have looked all over for you
if I wanted to end things.

10:40.556 --> 10:43.893
You and our family
are all that I've ever fought for.

10:46.771 --> 10:49.023
And I'll never give that up.

11:34.235 --> 11:35.486
Don't you ever…

11:45.871 --> 11:47.748
leave my side again.

13:13.209 --> 13:18.214
EPISODE 12
NOT HELL YET

13:22.384 --> 13:26.764
Something about the foundation's funding
for Mr. Seo's hospital bills

13:26.847 --> 13:28.140
seems a bit odd.

13:30.893 --> 13:31.852
What do you mean?

13:32.603 --> 13:34.688
Around the time of Mr. Seo's accident,

13:35.272 --> 13:36.982
Hyeon-seong was in Ireland too.

13:38.692 --> 13:44.448
It was confirmed that Hui-ju
had attended an art fair at that time.

13:44.532 --> 13:46.784
But we don't know where Hyeon-seong was.

13:48.744 --> 13:49.703
In my opinion--

13:49.787 --> 13:52.206
I don't pay you to give me your opinions.

13:52.790 --> 13:55.751
Just provide me
with the information I want.

13:56.418 --> 13:58.337
How dare you track my son?

13:59.129 --> 14:01.590
We shouldn't rule out
the possibility of an issue--

14:01.674 --> 14:05.970
Having issues isn't the problem.
It's about whether it's fixable or not.

14:08.264 --> 14:11.892
I'm not paying you for nothing.
Just do what I tell you.

14:20.192 --> 14:22.861
They've all been compensated,

14:22.945 --> 14:26.323
and we've given them
more time to move out.

14:26.907 --> 14:30.327
The demolition can begin right away
since there are no residents.

14:30.411 --> 14:31.996
We've also announced

14:32.079 --> 14:35.666
the bidding of the supervision service
for the renovation.

14:37.835 --> 14:39.503
Has Lee Ju-yeong come to school yet?

14:39.587 --> 14:42.298
She's been absent
ever since the incident with her father.

14:42.381 --> 14:44.884
-Should I contact her through her teacher?
-It's okay.

14:44.967 --> 14:46.427
If she continues not to attend,

14:46.510 --> 14:48.596
take her out of the roll
with a grace period.

14:49.305 --> 14:51.265
-You may leave.
-Sir.

14:52.683 --> 14:55.811
Mr. Lee Hyeong-gi has been acting strange.

14:58.147 --> 15:00.399
He's digging into the accident in Ireland.

15:05.321 --> 15:08.115
Should we be concerned about him?

15:09.783 --> 15:10.826
No, sir.

15:10.910 --> 15:13.078
I don't care if he digs into it,

15:14.663 --> 15:17.124
but I'd like to know why he is.

15:17.207 --> 15:18.417
Yes, sir.

15:51.075 --> 15:52.743
I read about contempt

15:53.994 --> 15:55.579
in a book once.

15:56.664 --> 15:58.666
The one who feels it

15:59.833 --> 16:02.252
is subjected to unbelievable pain.

16:03.170 --> 16:07.007
But the one who causes it
doesn't even show changes in their brain.

16:08.592 --> 16:10.678
No wonder they can keep doing it.

16:14.473 --> 16:15.641
Does it hurt?

16:16.517 --> 16:18.310
I was pretty hurt too.

16:20.896 --> 16:24.942
Since we're family,
we should share our pain.

16:25.025 --> 16:27.111
NEUROSURGERY OFFICE
DR. AN MIN-SEO

16:42.835 --> 16:44.128
You're here too.

16:45.546 --> 16:46.880
I was just about to leave.

16:54.888 --> 16:57.641
What is it?
You didn't say you were coming.

16:57.725 --> 16:59.977
I came for Ho-su's therapy

17:00.060 --> 17:02.187
and thought I'd stop by and say hi.

17:02.271 --> 17:04.481
I don't think we're that close.

17:05.274 --> 17:07.317
Leave. I have to tend to my patients.

17:13.824 --> 17:16.452
Why would someone
as bright as you put up with it?

17:19.038 --> 17:20.372
What do you even know?

17:20.456 --> 17:22.499
Since you put up with it, he keeps--

17:22.583 --> 17:23.876
Keeps what?

17:28.964 --> 17:31.383
Keeps putting his hands on you.

17:34.845 --> 17:36.305
That's none of your business.

17:37.765 --> 17:40.726
-But--
-I put up with it because I can.

17:40.809 --> 17:42.478
That's the only issue we have.

17:42.561 --> 17:44.730
And that will become a problem one day.

17:44.813 --> 17:47.483
Don't lecture me.
You even failed to keep your son safe.

17:47.566 --> 17:48.609
Min-seo.

17:48.692 --> 17:50.903
My husband knows that he's wrong,

17:52.196 --> 17:54.073
so he treats me well most of the time.

17:54.156 --> 17:58.035
He's not actually sorry.
He's just worried that you'll leave him.

17:59.286 --> 18:01.872
You know that he's just a coward.

18:01.955 --> 18:02.831
I do.

18:03.707 --> 18:07.294
I'm enduring it
because people are all garbage anyway.

18:10.339 --> 18:12.174
Your husband is no different.

18:14.343 --> 18:16.136
Don't stick your nose in my affairs.

18:16.220 --> 18:18.430
I'm only doing this because we're family.

18:20.808 --> 18:21.767
Family?

18:22.643 --> 18:26.230
I'm afraid you're gravely mistaken.

18:26.814 --> 18:30.484
If you and Hyeon-seong get a divorce,
you and I are pretty much strangers.

18:31.693 --> 18:34.947
Don't be so cocky
thinking you have something on me.

18:35.030 --> 18:35.989
Get out.

18:50.504 --> 18:53.132
I never thought of it like that.

18:54.258 --> 18:55.843
I was just worried.

19:29.084 --> 19:30.460
Was it Ms. Gu?

19:36.425 --> 19:39.052
I doubt you did this
out of loyalty. So why?

19:39.136 --> 19:42.431
Did she promise
to give you money if you served some time?

19:52.149 --> 19:53.317
And did you believe that?

19:54.193 --> 19:57.613
The school will have no problem
carrying out the construction.

19:58.280 --> 19:59.406
Now,

20:00.324 --> 20:02.159
what do you think you'll get?

20:03.702 --> 20:04.870
The compensation?

20:06.830 --> 20:08.290
Do you think you'll get any?

20:10.292 --> 20:12.711
Do you still not get it?

20:13.921 --> 20:15.422
She…

20:16.882 --> 20:18.550
used you.

20:27.017 --> 20:28.352
Sit down.

20:29.186 --> 20:30.896
Sit down and listen to me.

20:41.156 --> 20:42.491
JINI BANK

20:42.574 --> 20:44.368
The compensation fee is in there.

20:44.451 --> 20:46.119
Since your father has bad credit,

20:46.203 --> 20:48.872
it was wise of him
to open a bank account in your name.

20:49.790 --> 20:54.127
You'll only be able to withdraw a small
amount every month for living expenses.

20:54.753 --> 20:57.506
Once you become an adult,
you can do whatever you want with it.

20:59.758 --> 21:04.388
It must be impossible for me to go
to Taerim High School of Arts now, right?

21:04.471 --> 21:05.806
There are many other schools.

21:06.848 --> 21:10.143
There's no reason for you to go
there and endure people's glares.

21:11.937 --> 21:13.188
Do you think Li-sa

21:14.856 --> 21:18.110
has already told everyone
about what my dad did?

21:18.193 --> 21:19.319
What if she has?

21:20.237 --> 21:22.030
Will you continue not going to school?

21:24.199 --> 21:26.118
If you don't graduate, it's your loss.

21:26.201 --> 21:30.539
Ignore the others. Don't miss
the opportunity in front of you.

21:31.665 --> 21:34.042
Opportunities don't come twice.

21:40.048 --> 21:42.134
<i>Can we meet if you're free?</i>

21:42.217 --> 21:43.343
<i>Let's have some coffee.</i>

21:43.927 --> 21:45.053
<i>Is anything wrong?</i>

21:53.770 --> 21:55.814
DELETE

21:55.897 --> 21:57.190
DELETE MESSAGES?

22:00.610 --> 22:03.196
I wondered why you had become so lax.

22:05.741 --> 22:09.911
I signed you up with that volunteer
recruitment for ex-convicts.

22:09.995 --> 22:11.455
We'll begin this weekend.

22:13.999 --> 22:16.168
You need to set an example for them.

22:16.960 --> 22:19.713
They should know that even if they sin,

22:19.796 --> 22:22.382
they can turn over a new leaf
as long as they live on.

22:24.509 --> 22:25.886
Aren't you tired of it?

22:28.680 --> 22:30.307
You should just hate me.

22:30.932 --> 22:33.602
I know you don't want me
to ask you for forgiveness, but--

22:34.561 --> 22:36.271
Don't be ridiculous.

22:37.439 --> 22:40.067
I've already forgiven you, Seon-u.

22:41.151 --> 22:44.404
It's my calling to protect you

22:44.488 --> 22:46.656
and guide you in the right direction,

22:46.740 --> 22:51.286
so you'll never forget what you did
and repeat the same mistake ever again.

22:57.167 --> 23:00.587
For my dear Jeong-seop
who has passed away,

23:01.755 --> 23:04.216
you just need to do as I say.

23:08.261 --> 23:09.262
Okay?

23:15.310 --> 23:16.311
Okay.

23:21.483 --> 23:22.776
See you this weekend.

23:53.348 --> 23:54.307
What are you doing?

23:57.519 --> 23:58.770
INCHEON TO DUBLIN

23:58.854 --> 24:00.438
Why did you look this up?

24:03.316 --> 24:04.734
Running away again?

24:04.818 --> 24:07.320
No. I want to find the old me.

24:07.404 --> 24:10.991
And once I do,
I'm going to ask you for forgiveness.

24:14.411 --> 24:16.204
I should try everything I can.

24:39.311 --> 24:40.478
Aren't you coming to bed?

24:43.982 --> 24:45.692
I'm bombarded with work.

24:47.652 --> 24:50.238
The new staff management system
is so different.

24:50.322 --> 24:52.073
It's a completely new system.

24:52.866 --> 24:53.867
Go to bed first.

25:01.208 --> 25:03.251
I went to the hospital today.

25:06.421 --> 25:10.508
And Seon-u asked
if everything was okay between us.

25:16.640 --> 25:18.600
He called me this afternoon.

25:19.184 --> 25:21.144
-He did?
-He asked me to take care of you

25:21.228 --> 25:23.146
since Ho-su's incident
must've shocked you.

25:23.897 --> 25:27.067
"My sister was forced
to grow up at a young age,

25:27.150 --> 25:29.194
so she never asks for any help."

25:29.277 --> 25:33.073
He told me to cut you some slack
even if you make a mistake.

25:36.326 --> 25:38.703
What's gotten into him today?

25:38.787 --> 25:40.997
What's so bad
about his worrying about you?

25:41.081 --> 25:43.375
I'm glad that he's my brother-in-law.

25:44.292 --> 25:46.294
Compared to you two,

25:48.797 --> 25:51.466
my sister and I are like strangers.

25:53.885 --> 25:57.931
You should be more attentive to her.

25:59.015 --> 26:01.518
She seems to be
going through a tough time.

26:01.601 --> 26:03.728
She makes life difficult for herself.

26:05.188 --> 26:06.481
That's who she is.

26:07.565 --> 26:10.277
She's been like our father
ever since she was young.

26:10.360 --> 26:12.445
But our father wasn't respected at home.

26:12.529 --> 26:14.447
So, to my mother and me…

26:15.365 --> 26:19.703
No. She always strives to look perfect in
others' eyes and only cares about herself.

26:20.829 --> 26:21.663
But still--

26:21.746 --> 26:24.291
She's hypnotized herself.
She listens to no one.

26:37.929 --> 26:38.763
Hui-ju.

26:39.764 --> 26:40.640
Yes?

26:41.850 --> 26:44.352
Don't walk on eggshells
around me. It's not like you.

26:46.896 --> 26:49.941
I believed you
when you said you regretted it.

26:53.320 --> 26:55.655
Tell your brother
that we're completely fine.

26:55.739 --> 26:58.450
That things are great as ever.

27:07.125 --> 27:08.501
Thank you.

27:15.216 --> 27:17.552
Right. Spare me some time tomorrow.

27:28.938 --> 27:30.482
Did you make a reservation?

27:31.316 --> 27:32.692
Yes. Under An Hyeon-seong.

27:32.776 --> 27:34.486
I see. I'll show you to your seat.

27:35.362 --> 27:37.030
Is she with you?

27:41.993 --> 27:44.204
Did Ms. Lee invite you too?

28:00.804 --> 28:03.932
Is Ms. Lee not coming? I thought she was.

28:04.015 --> 28:06.893
I knew you'd feel uncomfortable
if we invited you,

28:06.976 --> 28:08.436
so I asked for her help.

28:08.520 --> 28:10.271
She's not to blame.

28:10.355 --> 28:13.733
I wanted to treat you as a thank-you
for bringing Ho-su back to us.

28:17.445 --> 28:19.406
-The usual, please.
-Yes, sir.

28:22.075 --> 28:24.953
This brandy is
from our restaurant owner's collection.

28:25.036 --> 28:27.664
I was told to serve you this
the next time you came.

28:50.311 --> 28:52.897
It's venison. Their signature dish.

28:53.481 --> 28:56.735
We come here every now and then
because the owner likes Hui-ju's work.

28:57.235 --> 28:58.069
Try it.

29:00.029 --> 29:02.991
It's all thanks to you two
that I've made it this far.

29:06.578 --> 29:09.038
You told me
that being consistent was more important

29:09.122 --> 29:11.332
than my age, and you were right.

29:12.584 --> 29:15.503
At times, perseverance beats talent.

29:17.922 --> 29:21.092
I truly believed
you would become a great artist.

29:21.176 --> 29:22.969
If only you didn't quit midway.

29:23.052 --> 29:24.596
She didn't quit.

29:25.889 --> 29:27.807
She's just taking a break because of me.

29:28.433 --> 29:29.809
She didn't quit painting.

29:30.685 --> 29:33.897
Is that so? I'm curious about your work.

29:36.691 --> 29:38.693
I'm sure you've seen her early work.

29:39.819 --> 29:43.114
I imitated her work
in the beginning because I liked it.

29:44.491 --> 29:47.660
I was pretty good at expressing
destruction and deterioration

29:47.744 --> 29:49.537
through my paintings.

30:03.301 --> 30:05.637
This glass is from our trips.

30:05.720 --> 30:08.264
You remember it. It's your favorite.

30:09.265 --> 30:10.558
Thank you.

30:12.685 --> 30:15.230
What was the name
of this black mushroom again?

30:15.313 --> 30:19.025
You told me that
when we were on our trip to Provence

30:19.692 --> 30:21.236
<i>Trompette de la mort.</i>

30:22.487 --> 30:24.531
I barely recognize the name.

30:25.114 --> 30:26.616
"The trumpet of the dead."

30:27.617 --> 30:30.078
Since the mushrooms look like trumpets.

30:30.912 --> 30:33.331
But shouldn't it be the other way around?

30:34.499 --> 30:35.333
I'm not sure.

30:46.761 --> 30:49.597
Why bother treating me
when you want to rip me to shreds?

30:52.225 --> 30:54.811
This was my husband's idea.
I still don't trust you.

30:55.311 --> 30:59.357
There may be no proof,
but I know that you egged Mr. Lee on.

30:59.941 --> 31:03.361
Then what is this? Are you fattening
me up before the slaughter?

31:03.945 --> 31:07.782
You said watching my downfall
was your definition of revenge.

31:10.034 --> 31:13.121
You and I have
very different definitions of revenge.

31:14.956 --> 31:18.501
Because I'm going
to show you how happy I am.

31:21.296 --> 31:22.922
Are you sure you're happy?

31:24.007 --> 31:25.967
You looked very uncomfortable.

31:27.218 --> 31:29.637
Sitting there like a trophy wife.

31:30.722 --> 31:31.973
You once told me

31:32.932 --> 31:36.686
that marriage is the only chance
to dramatically turn one's life around.

31:38.646 --> 31:43.359
Well… Looking at you,
I can't say you're wrong.

31:45.278 --> 31:49.157
But it's pathetic
that the transformation isn't that great.

31:50.450 --> 31:52.118
You're like a shackled slave

31:52.201 --> 31:54.662
who's greatly mistaken
and thinks she's the owner.

31:55.246 --> 31:58.041
You seem a bit pitiful.

32:01.294 --> 32:05.548
That's rich coming from someone who's
dedicated her entire life to stalking me.

32:07.634 --> 32:10.345
I almost pitied you there.

32:11.554 --> 32:13.514
Thank you for saying that.

32:13.598 --> 32:15.016
That photo you sent me.

32:15.767 --> 32:18.227
You wanted to know who saw it, right?

32:20.355 --> 32:21.856
It was my husband.

32:25.693 --> 32:27.737
We talked it out all thanks to you.

32:28.780 --> 32:30.073
Thank you.

33:01.896 --> 33:05.316
I was surprised to hear
that you had majored in theatre,

33:06.234 --> 33:08.277
but your poker face was remarkable.

33:12.699 --> 33:14.367
They seem to be taking their time.

33:15.952 --> 33:18.955
Are you sure
you don't want to check up on them?

33:20.957 --> 33:23.459
I've forgiven my wife for what she did.

33:24.711 --> 33:27.714
So don't try to bring her down
with her past…

33:28.214 --> 33:29.215
No.

33:30.425 --> 33:33.428
Don't even think
about approaching my family.

33:33.511 --> 33:35.304
But I haven't forgiven her.

33:37.223 --> 33:38.516
So why must I do that?

33:38.599 --> 33:40.476
You're a smart person.

33:41.686 --> 33:45.481
I'm warning you because
I could pay you back tenfold.

33:56.617 --> 33:57.744
Are you okay?

33:59.662 --> 34:01.330
You don't look too good.

34:03.833 --> 34:06.919
Go first. I don't want
to cause any misunderstanding.

34:10.631 --> 34:11.466
Okay.

34:18.639 --> 34:20.641
What if I kill her?

34:22.935 --> 34:25.188
How will you pay me back tenfold?

34:25.271 --> 34:28.149
Will you dig me out of my grave
and chop me into pieces?

34:36.324 --> 34:37.742
Thank you for dinner.

34:38.409 --> 34:40.495
-Anytime.
-No.

34:40.578 --> 34:42.747
I'm not comfortable
with this kind of gathering.

34:43.289 --> 34:45.208
We'll get going then.

34:46.459 --> 34:47.335
Let's go.

35:10.358 --> 35:12.568
I wonder if that dinner was necessary.

35:14.320 --> 35:15.738
I wanted to show them…

35:17.824 --> 35:19.826
that we were doing just fine.

35:26.833 --> 35:29.502
Thank you. And I'm sorry.

36:03.327 --> 36:05.913
Go sleep inside. I'll sleep here.

36:08.040 --> 36:11.335
They looked happy, didn't they?

36:16.632 --> 36:18.301
What makes us so different?

36:22.430 --> 36:24.390
Seeing her reminded me

36:26.058 --> 36:27.935
of how much I wanted to be like her.

36:33.816 --> 36:35.902
One of the people I'm supposed to despise

36:36.527 --> 36:39.280
is someone I admired so much.

36:43.075 --> 36:46.370
And the other one is
someone I loved dearly.

36:51.417 --> 36:56.130
Don't you feel bad
that I have to hate both of them?

37:29.288 --> 37:31.916
-Want to go? Take it.
-Send it right now.

37:31.999 --> 37:33.084
She's here.

37:34.543 --> 37:36.963
What took her so long?
I can't believe her.

37:37.463 --> 37:38.506
What are you doing?

37:39.215 --> 37:40.800
Stop laughing, Na-yeon.

37:40.883 --> 37:42.301
When did I ever?

37:43.177 --> 37:45.137
-It reeks.
-I want to go out.

37:45.763 --> 37:47.723
-What?
-Let's open the windows.

37:47.807 --> 37:49.016
Let's do that.

37:51.560 --> 37:53.312
-What is that?
-It stinks.

37:53.396 --> 37:55.815
-Li-sa, where are you going?
-The restroom.

37:57.483 --> 37:59.735
-Hey.
-Look at her.

37:59.819 --> 38:02.655
She's even throwing away
her textbooks. Shitty attitude.

38:15.293 --> 38:18.629
You didn't text me back,
so I decided to just come here.

38:19.463 --> 38:20.589
I'm sorry.

38:21.966 --> 38:23.175
My sister

38:24.635 --> 38:26.470
was like a mom to me.

38:28.556 --> 38:30.808
I was born into a poor family.

38:31.475 --> 38:34.520
Since everyone else was poor,
I had no aspirations.

38:36.355 --> 38:39.775
I'm only able to live like this
thanks to my sister.

38:41.402 --> 38:44.780
My sister never got
what she wanted before getting married.

38:44.864 --> 38:48.451
She had to support our mom and me.
The only dream she had

38:49.535 --> 38:51.871
was to live in a house
that had an indoor toilet.

38:56.292 --> 38:58.210
Then she met Hyeon-seong.

38:58.294 --> 39:01.047
A sudden luxurious lifestyle
must've flustered her.

39:03.174 --> 39:05.092
She must've felt lost.

39:05.968 --> 39:09.555
It was probably a mistake
she made out of loneliness.

39:10.139 --> 39:11.432
What are you doing?

39:12.600 --> 39:16.479
It's different for her now.
Her family is all that she has.

39:16.562 --> 39:18.981
She will never
get back together with Woo-jae.

39:20.858 --> 39:22.318
It could be a misunderstanding.

39:22.401 --> 39:24.528
Hui-ju is so blessed.

39:25.821 --> 39:28.157
She has a brother who defends her

39:29.116 --> 39:32.078
and a husband
who forgave her for having an affair.

39:32.161 --> 39:34.455
And now you want me to suppress my anger?

39:38.209 --> 39:40.127
How are you all so cruel?

39:42.380 --> 39:43.255
I'm sorry.

39:44.882 --> 39:46.133
How disgusting.

39:46.801 --> 39:48.928
Let me apologize on her behalf.

39:50.221 --> 39:54.475
I can't fathom how much pain
you felt from their betrayal.

39:55.810 --> 39:56.811
But Hui-ju

39:58.187 --> 40:00.648
will never make the same mistake, so…

40:27.299 --> 40:29.552
SEO WOO-JAE

40:50.531 --> 40:53.659
JEONG HUI-JU

40:57.621 --> 40:58.706
<i>Hello?</i>

41:01.459 --> 41:02.626
<i>Hello?</i>

41:03.669 --> 41:05.087
It's me, Woo-jae.

41:06.422 --> 41:07.381
What is it?

41:11.844 --> 41:16.265
I'll send my rough draft
for the project to Ms. Lee.

41:17.725 --> 41:21.854
Right. I'll share mine too once I'm done.

41:22.521 --> 41:24.607
-Goodbye.
<i>-Don't hang up.</i>

41:27.026 --> 41:31.322
You didn't answer me the other day,
so let me ask you one last time.

41:34.658 --> 41:37.411
I left Hae-won and flew to Ireland

41:38.412 --> 41:39.872
because of you.

41:42.500 --> 41:47.087
<i>And it seems to me that you let me
stay with you for the time being.</i>

41:48.964 --> 41:50.132
<i>Am I right?</i>

41:56.680 --> 41:59.141
Seeing how I left without telling her,

42:00.226 --> 42:02.269
I must have planned to return.

42:02.353 --> 42:05.189
So why did I stay in Ireland all alone?

42:14.782 --> 42:15.741
I don't know.

42:17.952 --> 42:18.994
Then…

42:22.540 --> 42:24.291
why did we break up?

42:47.648 --> 42:49.233
<i>The reason why we broke up…</i>

42:51.360 --> 42:54.446
<i>No. The reason why I abandoned you…</i>

43:03.581 --> 43:06.041
Mom, isn't this pretty?

43:07.167 --> 43:09.587
Mom, look at this.

43:09.670 --> 43:11.630
Li-sa, stay here.

43:36.947 --> 43:39.158
How could you come here?

43:39.241 --> 43:40.826
Are you nuts?

43:41.327 --> 43:43.287
Anyone would go nuts in my shoes.

43:47.416 --> 43:49.835
Don't do this. Go home.

43:49.918 --> 43:52.338
Wait for me back home. Okay?

43:55.174 --> 43:58.093
-Don't go.
-Woo-jae, don't do this.

43:58.761 --> 44:02.014
I have no choice right now.
Why are you doing this to me?

44:02.097 --> 44:03.641
Then take me with you.

44:05.851 --> 44:07.436
Take you where? There?

44:08.687 --> 44:10.022
Go home and wait for me.

44:11.690 --> 44:13.025
Woo-jae!

44:13.692 --> 44:17.112
Woo-jae, why are you doing this?
Please don't do this!

44:17.196 --> 44:18.947
Don't leave me.

44:20.074 --> 44:24.036
Please, Woo-jae.
Go wait at home. I'm sorry.

45:18.757 --> 45:19.800
Did you sleep with him?

45:20.759 --> 45:23.011
-What?
-Did you sleep with that bastard?

45:49.538 --> 45:52.458
Did you sleep with that bastard? Tell me!

45:54.042 --> 45:55.627
Do you still love him?

45:57.421 --> 45:58.755
Answer me!

46:03.844 --> 46:05.971
<i>I hated your recklessness.</i>

46:41.882 --> 46:43.425
What are you doing?

46:44.510 --> 46:45.886
I wanted a drink too.

46:48.138 --> 46:50.349
Go somewhere else. I don't want to--

46:50.432 --> 46:51.642
I came to drink together.

46:52.768 --> 46:53.602
Why?

46:54.686 --> 46:56.063
You seemed lonely.

46:57.064 --> 46:58.982
Who? Me?

46:59.066 --> 47:01.109
Yes. That's what I see.

47:02.277 --> 47:04.947
At a brunch cafe in broad daylight…

47:07.115 --> 47:09.785
Did you think no one would notice it here?

47:11.453 --> 47:12.996
So you caught me. Now leave.

47:14.748 --> 47:17.543
Excuse me. One beer, please.

47:22.506 --> 47:23.507
<i>But I also</i>

47:24.758 --> 47:27.261
<i>liked that recklessness of yours.</i>

48:25.736 --> 48:27.654
<i>I may have forgotten many things.</i>

48:27.738 --> 48:30.532
<i>But I still remember
how beautiful your art was</i>

48:31.325 --> 48:34.911
<i>and how incredible you were as a painter.</i>

48:38.373 --> 48:39.207
Done.

48:40.250 --> 48:41.877
Take a look. What do you think?

48:46.006 --> 48:48.467
Is it bad? Is it?

48:49.259 --> 48:51.470
-I like it.
-Really?

48:54.264 --> 48:55.849
In that case…

49:02.564 --> 49:03.482
What does that mean?

49:04.232 --> 49:06.860
"Hae" meaning "ocean"
and "Won" meaning "abundance."

49:08.111 --> 49:11.531
My grandpa named me so
so that I'd be thoughtful and well-off.

49:14.868 --> 49:16.161
<i>I'll come back.</i>

49:18.080 --> 49:19.998
<i>No matter how painful the memories are,</i>

49:21.500 --> 49:22.876
<i>I'll recover them.</i>

49:27.673 --> 49:30.676
HAE-WON

49:46.817 --> 49:49.194
These are just a few body parts,

49:49.277 --> 49:52.114
but they look more dynamic
and intense than his previous work.

49:52.197 --> 49:55.909
I guess working hard at his studio
for days on end paid off.

49:56.493 --> 49:59.246
Once they're made into molds,
they'll be even better.

50:02.457 --> 50:03.959
Gosh, I lost track of time.

50:05.252 --> 50:08.547
You should go.
I'll contact Mr. Seo myself.

50:08.630 --> 50:10.132
He's not in Korea right now.

50:10.215 --> 50:12.259
He's not? Then where is he?

50:13.343 --> 50:14.720
In Ireland.

50:15.303 --> 50:18.557
I trust that he'll finish up
the rest of his pieces,

50:18.640 --> 50:20.058
but why all of a sudden?

50:21.601 --> 50:23.687
He wants to retrieve his memories.

50:24.271 --> 50:26.982
I understand. He must be so frustrated.

50:27.566 --> 50:28.567
Yes.

50:29.234 --> 50:33.071
He promised to recover the memories
no matter how painful they may be.

50:34.865 --> 50:36.158
I'll just have to wait.

50:52.215 --> 50:54.718
IRELAND

51:27.292 --> 51:29.044
LET'S TAKE A RAIN CHECK. I'M BUSY TODAY.

51:29.127 --> 51:30.796
HONEY, CALL ME WHEN YOU'RE FREE.

51:30.879 --> 51:32.672
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

51:37.803 --> 51:38.804
Excuse me.

51:39.304 --> 51:41.515
Don't sleep here. Go sleep at home.

51:43.266 --> 51:44.684
Jeong-yeon?

51:45.977 --> 51:46.853
Jeong-yeon?

51:49.356 --> 51:50.816
Did you call me?

51:52.067 --> 51:54.736
Did you just call my name?

51:55.737 --> 51:56.571
Yes.

51:57.447 --> 51:58.365
Jeong-yeon.

51:59.574 --> 52:01.034
Gu Jeong-yeon, right?

52:02.077 --> 52:03.662
Come on.

52:04.454 --> 52:07.457
Why would you be calling my name?

52:08.708 --> 52:09.584
Sorry?

52:13.880 --> 52:17.384
"Call my name

52:17.467 --> 52:19.886
as I have called hers."

52:21.221 --> 52:25.976
"I will go to you and become your flower."

52:29.062 --> 52:33.233
It was my favorite poem
back in high school.

52:37.904 --> 52:42.200
What is it, Mr. Yoon?
Why did you call my name?

52:43.577 --> 52:47.372
What's so special about calling your name?
Isn't that what names are for?

52:47.455 --> 52:49.291
Then say it again.

52:50.834 --> 52:52.377
"Jeong-yeon."

52:53.795 --> 52:56.006
Call me even more tenderly.

52:56.089 --> 52:57.716
You're creeping me out.

52:58.383 --> 53:00.677
This is strange.

53:00.760 --> 53:03.305
Why do you look handsome?

53:04.055 --> 53:07.267
What? Why don't you look ugly anymore?

53:09.144 --> 53:11.730
I must have gone nuts.

53:12.230 --> 53:14.274
You're just drunk.

53:16.067 --> 53:17.861
I'm fine. I'm good.

53:19.529 --> 53:20.864
I'm not leaving.

53:20.947 --> 53:23.033
I'm going to stay here with him.

53:25.577 --> 53:27.120
NEW LUXURIOUS TOWNHOUSES

53:28.371 --> 53:30.999
Why keep these at home
when Ju-yeong is there?

53:33.501 --> 53:35.045
Is this where you spent your deposit?

53:36.004 --> 53:38.340
This is so frustrating. You never learn.

53:38.423 --> 53:41.301
Do you really not know?
Or are you purposely--

53:41.384 --> 53:42.218
Ms. Gu.

53:43.637 --> 53:46.097
Have you eaten yet?
I made some beef stew yesterday.

53:46.181 --> 53:48.224
-I'm not hungry.
-Have some first.

53:48.308 --> 53:50.352
If you're still mad afterward,
then get mad.

53:52.354 --> 53:54.105
If you get upset with someone,

53:54.689 --> 53:57.025
eat and take a nap.
Then you will feel better.

53:57.943 --> 54:01.196
We tend to feel irritable
not because of what they did

54:01.780 --> 54:02.948
but because we're tired.

54:11.081 --> 54:12.290
God…

54:13.041 --> 54:14.668
How is it that you know everything?

54:15.919 --> 54:17.128
See?

54:17.212 --> 54:19.798
Why did you take it out on me?

54:19.881 --> 54:21.341
Right?

54:21.424 --> 54:23.468
-How dare you?
-Jeong-yeon.

54:24.302 --> 54:25.261
Okay.

54:32.727 --> 54:34.020
Goodness.

54:39.609 --> 54:41.778
We shouldn't send him
to kindergarten for now.

54:41.861 --> 54:44.572
The teachers don't look
comfortable either.

54:44.656 --> 54:45.490
Change schools.

54:46.574 --> 54:49.661
Better yet, hire a private tutor
who'll teach him English

54:49.744 --> 54:51.287
so he can go abroad next year.

54:52.372 --> 54:53.289
Where's Hui-ju?

54:54.332 --> 54:56.459
Li-sa's dance exam is today. She's there.

54:56.543 --> 54:58.169
Replace her too if you can.

54:58.253 --> 54:59.462
Mom.

54:59.546 --> 55:02.382
There are many women who can
replace her as a mother, a wife,

55:02.465 --> 55:05.301
and especially my daughter-in-law.

55:05.385 --> 55:07.470
Ho-su might hear you. Watch what you say.

55:07.554 --> 55:11.099
One should be most calculating
when choosing whom to marry.

55:11.182 --> 55:13.268
I only said yes
since you vehemently refused

55:13.351 --> 55:16.104
to marry anyone else
or have kids if it wasn't with her.

55:16.187 --> 55:19.691
You take after me, but you got
your taste in women from your dad.

55:20.567 --> 55:22.652
Can you please…

55:24.487 --> 55:25.613
Please.

55:26.865 --> 55:30.410
It's been over a decade, and Hui-ju is
the mother of your grandchildren.

55:30.493 --> 55:32.328
Yet you still treat her with contempt.

55:32.412 --> 55:35.248
What would that make
this life I've chosen to lead?

55:35.331 --> 55:37.292
You can start afresh. What's the problem?

55:37.375 --> 55:40.795
You're still young.
Why let her wrap you around her finger?

55:44.215 --> 55:45.550
Because I love her.

55:47.427 --> 55:49.179
I love her more than

55:50.430 --> 55:51.639
she loves me.

55:51.723 --> 55:53.349
You lunatic.

55:55.143 --> 55:57.812
That's exactly why
I told you to be more calculating.

56:00.148 --> 56:03.568
In a relationship,
one side is bound to love the other more.

56:04.277 --> 56:07.781
It's impossible for the feeling
to be exactly mutual.

56:07.864 --> 56:10.909
So why does she have
the upper hand? You lack nothing!

56:13.703 --> 56:15.371
-Hey.
-Grandma.

56:15.455 --> 56:17.749
Ho-su, it's okay.

56:17.832 --> 56:19.709
Sleep more.

56:22.003 --> 56:25.298
He's a saint. He truly is.

56:32.388 --> 56:33.723
He's seriously

56:34.849 --> 56:37.519
forgiven you for everything?
Is that even possible?

56:39.604 --> 56:40.814
I don't know either.

56:42.232 --> 56:43.483
Is it really possible?

56:47.862 --> 56:51.616
He must only have doubts and no proof.
Then it's possible.

56:52.283 --> 56:53.910
Nowadays, it's not easy to forgive

56:53.993 --> 56:57.372
because proof is left
on all of our devices.

57:10.635 --> 57:15.849
Gosh, Hui-ju. You are truly blessed
with a wonderful husband.

57:15.932 --> 57:18.268
Hey, this is the epitome of true love.

57:19.310 --> 57:21.062
I envy you.

57:23.398 --> 57:24.941
I should be a better wife.

57:29.737 --> 57:31.865
How is Ho-su doing?

57:34.284 --> 57:37.954
Crazy bastards who mess with children
should get the death penalty.

57:38.580 --> 57:43.209
I think this is the punishment I get
for doing what I did in the past.

57:43.293 --> 57:46.254
Don't you say that out loud.
You need to be shameless.

57:46.337 --> 57:50.258
In-laws blame the mom first
if anything happens to her kid.

57:50.925 --> 57:53.511
And your mother-in-law
is the chief director? Good grief.

57:54.262 --> 57:57.557
She's always been eager to kick me out,

57:57.640 --> 58:01.102
even before this incident happened.

58:03.688 --> 58:06.691
But she won't allow it
if I demand a divorce.

58:08.026 --> 58:09.986
-Why not?
-I can only leave

58:10.069 --> 58:12.655
if they kick me out
for something I've done.

58:12.739 --> 58:14.699
I have no freedom of choice.

58:16.618 --> 58:20.246
How could someone like her
give birth to your husband?

58:22.540 --> 58:26.920
What about you?
How did it go with that guy?

58:27.003 --> 58:28.171
Thought you'd never ask.

58:29.672 --> 58:31.216
It's over! Damn it.

58:32.509 --> 58:37.388
You should never rekindle an old flame.
The breakup just gets messier.

58:37.472 --> 58:39.307
And I caused that.

58:41.017 --> 58:43.228
I feel too terrible
to even say that I'm sorry.

58:43.311 --> 58:47.065
Even friends need
to benefit from each other.

58:47.148 --> 58:48.691
But I'm always the one

58:49.651 --> 58:53.655
crying on your shoulder.
You must be sick of me.

58:55.073 --> 58:57.200
I can't say that I'm not.

58:58.535 --> 59:00.036
But I'll allow it if it's you.

59:01.871 --> 59:02.997
Why?

59:03.998 --> 59:05.250
Don't you remember?

59:06.251 --> 59:08.086
We're both crazy bitches.

59:31.067 --> 59:32.277
Did you hear?

59:35.572 --> 59:38.575
You know, about the old man in room 305.

59:38.658 --> 59:40.159
Are the rumors true?

59:40.243 --> 59:42.579
I heard she gives him handjobs for money.

59:42.662 --> 59:44.247
What a crazy bitch.

59:44.330 --> 59:47.083
She's no different from a prostitute.

59:47.166 --> 59:50.128
Shouldn't we report this
to the higher-ups?

59:50.211 --> 59:52.338
I heard Dong-mi has done it
numerous times.

59:52.422 --> 59:54.507
The patient on the fifth floor…

1:00:02.640 --> 1:00:03.933
What's so bad about that?

1:00:04.601 --> 1:00:06.936
He's alive
and has urges like everyone else.

1:00:07.437 --> 1:00:09.355
Imagine his suffering.

1:00:10.315 --> 1:00:13.359
What's so bad about relieving that?

1:00:16.446 --> 1:00:18.740
She's also a crazy bitch.

1:00:20.199 --> 1:00:23.244
No one in this hospital is normal.
They're all crazy.

1:00:23.328 --> 1:00:24.370
Let's go.

1:00:27.790 --> 1:00:28.958
A crazy bitch?

1:00:29.042 --> 1:00:31.419
You're right. I remember.

1:00:37.925 --> 1:00:40.678
Even after I inherited
this fishing spot from that old man

1:00:40.762 --> 1:00:43.181
and went through
that nasty feud with his children,

1:00:43.264 --> 1:00:44.390
only you defended me.

1:00:45.350 --> 1:00:47.393
You said I deserved this place

1:00:47.477 --> 1:00:50.563
since I stayed by his side
until the very end, unlike his children.

1:00:50.647 --> 1:00:54.150
So you own a big share of this place.

1:00:55.693 --> 1:00:59.864
Feel free to come here whenever you wish
as long as I own this place.

1:01:06.663 --> 1:01:08.498
Yes. Hello.

1:01:09.540 --> 1:01:10.541
Yes.

1:01:12.251 --> 1:01:13.252
Really?

1:01:14.295 --> 1:01:16.297
I see. Thank you.

1:01:17.715 --> 1:01:20.718
Li-sa passed with flying colors.
At least that's over with.

1:01:23.221 --> 1:01:24.305
You're so elated.

1:01:27.600 --> 1:01:29.686
Did you do well on the exam?

1:01:29.769 --> 1:01:32.480
Of course. But shouldn't you
be apologizing to me first?

1:01:33.690 --> 1:01:36.025
I'm sorry that my dad
is a horrible person.

1:01:37.402 --> 1:01:38.611
We've cut ties, though.

1:01:40.196 --> 1:01:42.740
Do you really not see him anymore?
Is that possible?

1:01:43.783 --> 1:01:44.701
Yes.

1:01:47.412 --> 1:01:48.871
I'm better off without him.

1:01:49.997 --> 1:01:51.165
I guess.

1:01:51.249 --> 1:01:53.209
LEE JU-YEONG
HAS SENT A VIDEO

1:01:56.713 --> 1:01:58.923
LEE JU-YEONG

1:01:59.006 --> 1:02:00.758
I don't need these anymore.

1:02:02.135 --> 1:02:03.386
I'm not going to Taerim.

1:02:04.929 --> 1:02:05.847
I'm…

1:02:08.433 --> 1:02:09.726
going here instead.

1:02:13.771 --> 1:02:15.523
EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM

1:02:15.606 --> 1:02:17.191
The dormitory is excellent.

1:02:17.275 --> 1:02:19.736
I'll stay at Ms. Gu's
or her mother's during breaks.

1:02:19.819 --> 1:02:21.863
What? When did this happen?

1:02:21.946 --> 1:02:23.823
You saw how they all bullied me.

1:02:24.741 --> 1:02:27.368
I'll be bullied
if I attend Taerim since you'll be there.

1:02:28.745 --> 1:02:30.580
I can always make new friends.

1:02:30.663 --> 1:02:33.750
Once I graduate, I'll move out
with the money from your dad.

1:02:34.500 --> 1:02:36.961
Their visual production department
got many awards.

1:02:37.044 --> 1:02:38.880
Many of the students became successful.

1:02:38.963 --> 1:02:40.506
This school is much better for me.

1:02:45.261 --> 1:02:46.679
-Hey.
-Hi.

1:02:47.513 --> 1:02:48.514
I have plans.

1:02:49.182 --> 1:02:50.850
This is my treat.

1:02:53.936 --> 1:02:55.062
You're early.

1:02:55.146 --> 1:02:56.814
I am. Did we have many customers?

1:04:14.851 --> 1:04:18.437
<i>Mr. Seo departed for Ireland
yesterday morning.</i>

1:05:48.653 --> 1:05:49.654
"Jeong"?

1:05:52.740 --> 1:05:53.908
As in Ms. Jeong?

1:06:06.128 --> 1:06:07.046
Again?

1:06:08.172 --> 1:06:09.799
I can't pass up on stout.

1:06:13.594 --> 1:06:16.305
We'll get one of this,
two glasses of stout,

1:06:17.807 --> 1:06:21.560
and extra soda bread. Then we're good.

1:06:22.812 --> 1:06:23.813
Okay.

1:06:41.414 --> 1:06:42.999
When the beer is served,

1:06:43.916 --> 1:06:46.877
drink it first before the food comes out.

1:06:46.961 --> 1:06:48.754
-Beer first?
-Yes. Slowly.

1:06:48.838 --> 1:06:51.257
After that, have the clam chowder.

1:06:51.340 --> 1:06:54.552
And don't stuff your face
with the soda bread. Just dip it.

1:06:55.386 --> 1:06:56.929
Then you'll slowly get full.

1:06:57.013 --> 1:07:00.641
Then no one will know that we're broke.

1:07:15.072 --> 1:07:16.282
I told you it'd be enough.

1:07:29.754 --> 1:07:31.005
-Slowly?
-Yes.

1:07:40.139 --> 1:07:41.474
Eat slowly.

1:07:59.742 --> 1:08:00.659
Are you okay?

1:08:01.869 --> 1:08:03.120
Did you get hurt?

1:08:03.871 --> 1:08:04.997
Let me see.

1:08:07.792 --> 1:08:09.752
What's wrong? I heard you did well today.

1:08:09.835 --> 1:08:12.546
You met up with a friend too.
What's the matter?

1:08:13.214 --> 1:08:14.840
Since when did you care?

1:08:14.924 --> 1:08:17.051
Do you even care about me?

1:08:19.178 --> 1:08:22.473
Li-sa, how could you say that?

1:08:22.556 --> 1:08:23.766
I'm just--

1:08:24.892 --> 1:08:27.353
Why would you-- Li-sa!

1:08:31.232 --> 1:08:32.233
Gosh.

1:08:34.777 --> 1:08:36.362
<i>Why aren't you here yet?</i>

1:08:36.445 --> 1:08:38.405
<i>Are you going to keep me waiting?</i>

1:08:38.489 --> 1:08:41.867
Of course not. I'm on my way now, Mother.

1:08:41.951 --> 1:08:44.453
Did Ho-su take his medication?

1:08:48.958 --> 1:08:52.878
I saw that the compensation
was sent to Ju-yeong's account.

1:08:54.296 --> 1:08:55.631
Thank you.

1:08:56.882 --> 1:08:59.135
I didn't do it to hear that from you.

1:09:01.303 --> 1:09:02.304
You once asked

1:09:03.097 --> 1:09:06.058
if Woo-jae was hospitalized
in Sligo General Hospital.

1:09:07.977 --> 1:09:09.186
He was.

1:09:10.771 --> 1:09:13.941
But unlike what you know,
it wasn't just because of the accident.

1:09:17.027 --> 1:09:19.613
I heard Ho-su was born in that hospital.

1:09:21.323 --> 1:09:23.033
I heard it was very tough

1:09:23.117 --> 1:09:26.078
for Hui-ju to give birth to him alone
far away from home.

1:09:29.748 --> 1:09:31.500
But do you believe that?

1:09:42.928 --> 1:09:44.263
You should check it.

1:09:45.848 --> 1:09:48.475
I'm also curious whose name was written

1:09:49.602 --> 1:09:50.895
as her guardian.

1:10:32.186 --> 1:10:33.270
Ho-su.

1:10:36.440 --> 1:10:38.150
Open your mouth.

1:13:39.248 --> 1:13:41.500
<i>Let's go to the Cliffs of Moher.</i>

1:13:43.168 --> 1:13:45.671
When we look at something so beautiful,

1:13:46.922 --> 1:13:48.924
we'll want to live.

1:13:51.218 --> 1:13:53.345
<i>Standing way up there,</i>

1:13:53.929 --> 1:13:56.265
<i>who would you think of?</i>

1:14:22.374 --> 1:14:23.792
<i>I can't do this anymore.</i>

1:14:23.876 --> 1:14:25.210
<i>Did I</i>

1:14:26.253 --> 1:14:27.421
<i>have feelings for you?</i>

1:14:31.550 --> 1:14:34.386
Do you remember?

1:14:37.264 --> 1:14:40.350
<i>I don't think there's any need
to try to remember what's already past.</i>

1:14:40.976 --> 1:14:43.520
If you don't remember it,
then it's never happened.

1:15:01.079 --> 1:15:02.080
Hui-ju.

1:15:06.293 --> 1:15:07.377
Jeong Hui-ju.

1:15:11.298 --> 1:15:13.050
Jeong Hui-ju!

1:15:56.260 --> 1:15:59.680
<i>I'm going to get back
everything that I lost.</i>

1:15:59.763 --> 1:16:01.098
<i>Ho-su's my son.</i>

1:16:01.181 --> 1:16:03.016
You remember.

1:16:04.518 --> 1:16:05.602
Ho-su is my son.

1:16:05.686 --> 1:16:08.063
I let her in because I needed a grandson!

1:16:11.733 --> 1:16:13.902
<i>Is it clear to you now
who Ho-su's father is?</i>

1:16:13.986 --> 1:16:17.656
<i>-Did Mr. Seo get his memories back?
-Jeong Hui-ju!</i>

1:16:17.739 --> 1:16:20.701
<i>You have no idea
how passionate Hui-ju can be.</i>

1:16:20.784 --> 1:16:22.411
You will never get to know.

1:16:24.830 --> 1:16:26.707
<i>You said you loved him, didn't you?</i>

1:16:26.790 --> 1:16:28.917
<i>Come back to me.</i>

1:16:29.710 --> 1:16:31.545
<i>I won't let you run off this time.</i>

1:16:33.463 --> 1:16:38.468
