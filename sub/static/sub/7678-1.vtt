00:37.246 --> 00:42.468
<i>The Pilgrim's Progress.
From this World to That Which is to Come,</i>

00:43.335 --> 00:46.214
<i>Delivered Under the Similitude of a Dream.</i>

00:48.632 --> 00:52.387
<i>Wherein is Discovered,
The Manner of His Setting Out,</i>

00:52.928 --> 00:54.680
<i>His Dangerous Journey</i>

00:55.556 --> 00:58.560
<i>And Safe Arrival at the Desired Country.</i>

01:48.817 --> 01:52.412
<i>As I walked through
the wilderness of this world,</i>

01:52.529 --> 01:55.954
<i>I lighted on a certain place
where was a den</i>

01:57.159 --> 01:59.787
<i>and I laid me down in that place to sleep.</i>

02:00.704 --> 02:04.208
<i>And as I slept, I dreamed a dream.</i>

02:06.084 --> 02:09.429
<i>I saw a man clothed with rags,</i>

02:09.588 --> 02:14.389
<i>standing in a certain place with
his face from his own house</i>

02:14.551 --> 02:18.852
<i>book in his hand,
and a great burden upon his back.</i>

02:22.643 --> 02:24.862
<i>All those years...</i>

02:26.938 --> 02:28.940
<i>living the life of someone...</i>

02:30.692 --> 02:32.239
<i>I didn't even know.</i>

03:01.014 --> 03:05.690
<i>Remember the story
I used to tell you when you were a boy...</i>

03:06.520 --> 03:08.113
<i>about a young prince.</i>

03:09.648 --> 03:11.696
<i>A knight,</i>

03:12.567 --> 03:15.286
<i>sent by his father, the King of the East,</i>

03:17.614 --> 03:19.161
<i>west into Egypt...</i>

03:23.578 --> 03:25.125
<i>to find a pearl.</i>

03:30.919 --> 03:34.014
<i>A pearl from the depths of the sea.</i>

03:44.474 --> 03:46.568
<i>But when the prince arrived,</i>

03:49.229 --> 03:53.075
<i>the people poured him a cup
that took away his memory.</i>

03:55.902 --> 03:58.200
<i>He forgot he was the son of the king.</i>

04:04.703 --> 04:06.455
<i>Forgot about the pearl...</i>

04:13.086 --> 04:15.384
<i>and fell into a deep sleep.</i>

04:35.901 --> 04:38.780
<i>The king didn't forget his son.</i>

04:40.947 --> 04:43.370
<i>He continued to send word...</i>

04:47.871 --> 04:49.418
<i>messengers...</i>

04:54.836 --> 04:56.634
<i>guides.</i>

05:00.383 --> 05:03.603
<i>But the prince... slept on.</i>

08:43.565 --> 08:46.034
<i>You see the palm trees?</i>

08:47.027 --> 08:49.405
<i>They tell you anything's possible.</i>

08:53.074 --> 08:54.621
<i>You can be anything...</i>

08:56.703 --> 08:58.250
<i>do anything...</i>

09:00.582 --> 09:02.129
<i>start over.</i>

09:06.004 --> 09:07.551
<i>You know?</i>

09:10.216 --> 09:14.062
I'm asking for your permission to make this

09:14.220 --> 09:17.269
a dramatic scene for one second...

09:41.247 --> 09:42.794
<i>My son...</i>

09:51.049 --> 09:52.596
<i>you are just like I am.</i>

09:58.681 --> 10:00.524
<i>Can't figure your life out?</i>

10:04.896 --> 10:06.990
<i>Can't put the pieces together?</i>

10:13.404 --> 10:15.406
<i>Just like me.</i>

10:23.456 --> 10:25.083
<i>A pilgrim on this earth.</i>

10:29.379 --> 10:30.926
<i>A stranger.</i>

10:54.195 --> 10:55.947
<i>Fragments...</i>

10:59.159 --> 11:00.706
<i>pieces...</i>

11:02.996 --> 11:04.543
<i>of a man.</i>

11:16.426 --> 11:18.724
<i>Where did I go wrong?</i>

11:58.092 --> 12:00.390
<i>What you wanna talk about?</i>

12:03.097 --> 12:05.316
You have nice eyes.

12:05.808 --> 12:07.355
Aren't I lucky.

12:07.936 --> 12:09.654
Where do you live?

12:09.812 --> 12:11.359
Why do ya wanna know?

12:12.649 --> 12:14.492
I want to write you a letter.

12:18.947 --> 12:21.416
What are you gonna say in your letter?

12:26.287 --> 12:28.665
Maybe you better not say it.

13:11.332 --> 13:14.962
<i>Let's live
like nobody's ever done it before.</i>

13:17.547 --> 13:18.594
<i>Wicked.</i>

13:18.756 --> 13:22.010
<i>Once the soul
was perfect and had wings...</i>

13:22.176 --> 13:23.519
<i>Brave.</i>

13:23.678 --> 13:29.060
<i>...it could soar into heaven
where only creatures with wings can be.</i>

13:29.267 --> 13:33.067
<i>But the soul lost its wings
and fell to Earth.</i>

13:33.229 --> 13:35.323
<i>There it took an earthly body.</i>

13:35.523 --> 13:38.367
<i>And now, while it lives in this body,</i>

13:38.526 --> 13:41.700
<i>no outward sign of wings can be seen.</i>

13:42.196 --> 13:44.995
<i>Yet the roots of its wings are still there.</i>

13:45.158 --> 13:48.833
<i>And the nature of wings is to try to raise
the earthbound body</i>

13:48.995 --> 13:50.747
<i>and soar with it into heaven.</i>

13:50.913 --> 13:55.919
<i>When we see a beautiful woman, or a man...</i>

13:56.502 --> 14:01.804
<i>the soul remembers the beauty
it used to know in heaven.</i>

14:02.425 --> 14:07.647
<i>And wings begin to spout,
and that makes the soul want to fly,</i>

14:07.805 --> 14:10.433
<i>but it cannot yet.
It is still too weak.</i>

14:10.600 --> 14:15.481
<i>So the man keeps staring up
into the sky like a young bird.</i>

14:15.646 --> 14:18.195
<i>He has lost
all interest in the world...</i>

14:18.941 --> 14:23.822
<i>- Can I come over?
- We just left each other.</i>

14:23.988 --> 14:25.706
<i>Are you alone?</i>

14:27.450 --> 14:28.997
<i>Of course.</i>

14:29.160 --> 14:34.712
On my phone sheet, I got agent
writers up my ass trying to get this job.

14:34.874 --> 14:39.095
<i>I just want to sit next to you.</i>

14:40.213 --> 14:43.342
Teddy thinks
you're the guy for this.

14:44.675 --> 14:47.770
That means the assignment
you didn't turn in, right,

14:47.929 --> 14:51.274
you don't have to worry about it.
Here's what happens. That goes away.

14:52.266 --> 14:56.271
<i>- What are you wearing?
- A dress.</i>

14:56.437 --> 14:59.190
- <i>What's it made of?
- How should I know?</i>

15:00.400 --> 15:01.947
<i>Cotton, I guess.</i>

15:02.110 --> 15:04.989
We said there's no way
you're gonna do it.

15:05.154 --> 15:08.749
So what'd we do? Said, double your quote.
And he did it.

15:09.242 --> 15:12.917
And that, Chuck signed off of that.
Teddy gets who he wants.

15:13.079 --> 15:15.173
The biggest comedy star wants you.

15:15.331 --> 15:19.757
Five years ago you came to me and
wanted to write big movies in Hollywood.

15:20.837 --> 15:24.216
- I mean...
- Okay, I don't want to see.

15:24.382 --> 15:28.558
Moments like this
don't come along, okay? This is it.

15:37.728 --> 15:39.822
<i>I see how you look at me.</i>

15:45.153 --> 15:47.622
<i>You think I could make you crazy?</i>

15:51.576 --> 15:53.670
<i>Crack you out of your shell?</i>

16:02.420 --> 16:03.967
<i>Make you suffer?</i>

16:26.944 --> 16:33.202
I... think... you're... weak.

16:44.670 --> 16:46.217
<i>You don't want love.</i>

16:52.261 --> 16:54.935
<i>You want a love experience.</i>

17:12.281 --> 17:14.282
Am I bringing you back to life?

17:25.294 --> 17:26.796
<i>Love and do what you like.</i>

17:30.633 --> 17:32.180
<i>A saint said that.</i>

17:38.808 --> 17:40.810
<i>Desire so deep.</i>

17:43.104 --> 17:44.697
<i>I'll throw my life away.</i>

17:47.191 --> 17:49.569
<i>Don't go back to being dead.</i>

18:00.454 --> 18:02.127
<i>What do you want?</i>

18:29.859 --> 18:33.113
We're not leading the lives
that we are meant for.

18:37.241 --> 18:39.744
We're meant for something else.

19:32.254 --> 19:35.224
My brother will translate.

19:52.108 --> 19:54.236
He looks around.

20:01.659 --> 20:04.412
He walks near the edge of the cliff.

20:25.099 --> 20:27.727
She says, like shadows.

20:39.405 --> 20:41.783
<i>Where will I meet you?</i>

20:57.590 --> 20:59.684
<i>Which way should I go?</i>

21:10.853 --> 21:12.855
<i>Suppose it isn't there for me,</i>

21:14.732 --> 21:16.279
<i>in the end?</i>

21:42.092 --> 21:43.639
<i>How do I begin?</i>

22:37.731 --> 22:39.574
<i>Remember how you showed up?</i>

22:40.985 --> 22:44.239
<i>Your wrists were taped up
like a tennis player's.</i>

22:46.490 --> 22:49.539
<i>You walked around
like nothing had happened.</i>

22:54.373 --> 22:58.298
<i>You were always doing it,
pretending everything was okay.</i>

23:00.087 --> 23:01.714
<i>But it wasn't.</i>

23:14.560 --> 23:16.904
- That's my brother, Rick.
- How are ya?

23:17.062 --> 23:20.282
What's goin' on, now? Anything.
Same today?

23:21.191 --> 23:25.367
Don't know how many times
I thought I'd die right here on the street.

23:26.614 --> 23:30.585
I picked him up and I had him
in my car, and a cop pulled us over.

23:30.701 --> 23:36.128
I tell him, "I'm a Methodist minister
and I'm looking after you, alright?"

23:36.290 --> 23:37.837
And I got off.

24:08.238 --> 24:13.460
<i>I dreamed that we were caught in
a huge tidal wave that engulfed the city.</i>

24:16.914 --> 24:20.168
<i>Any moment it seemed like
we might be swept under.</i>

24:23.545 --> 24:26.674
<i>There was a door
that I was afraid to go through.</i>

24:29.218 --> 24:32.973
<i>- I touched the knob...
- If I stuck you with a fork.</i>

24:34.974 --> 24:37.773
<i>Just wanna feel somethin', man.</i>

24:40.396 --> 24:42.319
<i>Wish we could do some things.</i>

24:44.108 --> 24:47.703
<i>Like goin' out on the Snake River together.
Remember?</i>

24:50.406 --> 24:52.579
<i>Think I'd end up here.</i>

24:55.911 --> 24:57.458
<i>Gracias.</i>

25:05.421 --> 25:07.765
It's good of you to invite me out here.

25:09.925 --> 25:12.678
Show me what it's like
to live a normal life.

25:21.395 --> 25:23.318
Somethin' wrong?

25:31.572 --> 25:33.119
What's up?

25:34.158 --> 25:37.412
I can tell when somethin's wrong, man.
I know you.

25:56.055 --> 25:58.683
What do you wanna talk about?

26:03.270 --> 26:06.524
I'm the only brother you got left.
You can tell me.

26:07.399 --> 26:08.946
I tell you stuff.

26:09.818 --> 26:11.912
<i>I loved my brother then.</i>

26:14.698 --> 26:16.245
<i>I hated him, too.</i>

26:18.702 --> 26:21.956
<i>For destroying everything
I'd been trying to do.</i>

26:22.956 --> 26:25.334
<i>To build us back up after Billy died.</i>

26:28.921 --> 26:34.223
I remember when they were putting Billy
in the ground, Dad went into hysterics.

26:35.761 --> 26:37.308
"My son!"

26:38.013 --> 26:39.560
Who fucking does that?

26:41.975 --> 26:44.194
<i>They said he took his life.</i>

26:45.896 --> 26:47.443
<i>But they don't know.</i>

26:51.693 --> 26:53.912
Oh, right now. Come on.

26:56.657 --> 26:58.204
I gotta feel something.

26:58.408 --> 26:59.955
<i>Like a snake.</i>

27:03.914 --> 27:05.461
<i>Swallowed him.</i>

27:06.625 --> 27:08.172
Come on, feel it.

27:16.009 --> 27:17.682
<i>Blind.</i>

27:22.015 --> 27:23.062
<i>Deaf.</i>

27:34.778 --> 27:36.325
<i>Grasping.</i>

27:37.114 --> 27:39.833
<i>I just wanted to twist a cane.</i>

27:43.996 --> 27:45.748
<i>Strike out, break free.</i>

27:47.791 --> 27:49.293
<i>Didn't have the guts.</i>

28:00.053 --> 28:01.976
<i>He's just an old fool.</i>

28:06.435 --> 28:08.813
<i>Just let him die with his blinders on.</i>

28:29.291 --> 28:31.134
<i>Redeem my life.</i>

28:35.505 --> 28:37.052
<i>Justify it.</i>

28:37.216 --> 28:42.393
<i>Ah, look at the fierce one.
The fierceness in his eyes. The rage!</i>

28:42.554 --> 28:44.852
...inflicted upon myself...

28:46.725 --> 28:48.272
<i>Oh Billy.</i>

28:51.521 --> 28:53.068
<i>I died.</i>

28:55.067 --> 28:56.614
<i>In a different way.</i>

29:03.325 --> 29:05.748
<i>I know you don't love me.</i>

29:11.208 --> 29:12.926
<i>I know things.</i>

29:13.085 --> 29:16.089
<i>- Say it.
- Serious information.</i>

29:19.675 --> 29:21.348
<i>I've blinded you.</i>

29:23.762 --> 29:25.309
<i>My life has...</i>

29:25.472 --> 29:28.726
I did every lousy, crappy job
that they wanted me to do.

29:28.892 --> 29:33.068
<i>But because I stumbled down
the road like a drunk...</i>

29:36.191 --> 29:38.660
<i>that doesn't mean it's the wrong one.</i>

29:55.627 --> 29:58.096
<i>I turned you upside down.</i>

30:04.011 --> 30:05.558
<i>My son.</i>

30:13.729 --> 30:16.699
<i>The light's gone out of your eyes.</i>

30:19.693 --> 30:21.240
<i>Womanizer.</i>

30:26.825 --> 30:28.372
<i>Cut off.</i>

31:19.503 --> 31:21.505
<i>Life.</i>

31:27.052 --> 31:28.599
<i>A goddess.</i>

32:40.625 --> 32:42.172
Angela...

32:45.797 --> 32:47.344
Frita...

32:47.507 --> 32:52.138
<i>Music is very important.
Helps me to fall in love.</i>

32:52.888 --> 32:54.731
<i>I fall in love 20 times a day.</i>

32:54.890 --> 32:58.815
Your face was very familiar to me, but I
didn't know from where. You're fantastic.

32:58.977 --> 33:00.149
Thank you.

33:00.312 --> 33:05.534
Listening to music on headsets, unaware you
are staring at them like a dirty ol' man.

33:06.401 --> 33:08.699
<i>Myself, I didn't wanna get a divorce.</i>

33:08.862 --> 33:13.208
I never stopped loving them.
But the way I loved them changed.

33:14.242 --> 33:15.494
<i>They are like flavors.</i>

33:15.660 --> 33:20.712
<i>Sometimes you want raspberry, then
after a while you want some strawberry.</i>

33:20.874 --> 33:23.878
- It's Abrasive.
- Oh, you are such a governor.

33:31.092 --> 33:32.935
- What's your name?
- Helen.

33:35.222 --> 33:36.769
What's your name?

33:37.432 --> 33:38.479
Rick.

33:38.600 --> 33:40.318
Do you know anybody here?

33:40.685 --> 33:43.063
No. Does that surprise you?

33:51.446 --> 33:53.369
- I know a guy.
- I know a guy...

33:54.199 --> 33:58.579
- ...like future space.
- You're at a party, it's alright.

34:18.431 --> 34:20.809
You know who'd be hot?
Cleopatra.

34:20.976 --> 34:23.775
If her nose had been this much shorter,

34:23.937 --> 34:26.031
it would've changed the world.

34:47.168 --> 34:48.715
<i>The Pearl.</i>

34:52.716 --> 34:54.263
<i>Somewhere in the sea.</i>

35:00.348 --> 35:01.895
<i>A chaos.</i>

35:07.897 --> 35:09.444
<i>Hungry.</i>

35:11.484 --> 35:13.612
<i>Longing for something other...</i>

35:17.824 --> 35:19.667
<i>without knowing what it is.</i>

35:29.127 --> 35:31.926
What about pink?
Do you like pink?

35:33.465 --> 35:39.973
- I love the company of women.
- It's pretty. Did it take long?

35:40.138 --> 35:43.108
<i>It seemed they knew something.</i>

35:43.266 --> 35:45.189
Some men don't like pink.

35:45.352 --> 35:49.778
- <i>But closer.</i>
- Now you tell me something.

35:51.900 --> 35:53.743
<i>To the mystery.</i>

36:04.996 --> 36:07.624
<i>Treat this world as it deserves.</i>

36:10.043 --> 36:11.886
<i>There are no principles...</i>

36:13.296 --> 36:14.843
<i>just circumstances.</i>

36:22.222 --> 36:23.769
<i>Nobody's home.</i>

36:23.932 --> 36:27.436
<i>Smoke machines in an empty sea.</i>

36:27.602 --> 36:29.195
<i>I got women in Tennessee.</i>

36:29.354 --> 36:33.655
<i>What can run but never walk,
some word have I found but never talk.</i>

36:33.775 --> 36:35.869
<i>Gonna take me out to see...</i>

36:54.921 --> 36:56.468
<i>Get up.</i>

37:07.892 --> 37:09.610
<i>Find it.</i>

37:11.438 --> 37:16.410
<i>There's a ketamine party we're having
next week. Have you ever heard of that?</i>

37:16.526 --> 37:22.124
<i>You're here for 20 seconds and then,
wham, you're out. You're in another room.</i>

37:22.282 --> 37:25.832
Your wife. You're in another one.
You oughtta do that.

37:25.994 --> 37:29.715
Have you been to Sarajevo?
I have prayed, man,

37:29.873 --> 37:35.801
for God to take my arm, take both arms.
I felt so useless.

37:35.962 --> 37:37.714
What's your name?

38:13.374 --> 38:15.217
<i>Dear friend.</i>

38:17.629 --> 38:19.848
<i>I wonder where
I was in all that time.</i>

38:23.134 --> 38:24.681
<i>A sleepwalker.</i>

38:31.100 --> 38:33.819
<i>In love with the world,
in love with love.</i>

38:41.402 --> 38:43.951
<i>The world's a swamp.</i>

38:45.573 --> 38:47.246
<i>You have to fly over it.</i>

38:48.910 --> 38:50.628
<i>Fly...</i>

38:54.457 --> 38:56.004
<i>High up...</i>

38:58.962 --> 39:00.885
<i>where everything is just...</i>

39:02.173 --> 39:03.720
<i>a speck.</i>

39:29.117 --> 39:30.664
<i>You changed.</i>

39:36.749 --> 39:38.342
<i>The world absorbed you.</i>

39:44.507 --> 39:46.054
<i>More and more.</i>

39:55.310 --> 39:58.029
<i>I regret that it turned out the way it did.</i>

39:58.897 --> 40:01.946
<i>You always wanted to get away.
I wanted a mate.</i>

40:03.359 --> 40:04.906
<i>I couldn't have you.</i>

40:08.740 --> 40:10.583
<i>Just didn't wanna be alone.</i>

40:29.427 --> 40:31.976
Are you sorry that you brought me here?

40:37.185 --> 40:38.732
Are you sorry you came?

40:40.521 --> 40:45.197
Do you remember how happy we were?
Different these days.

40:47.695 --> 40:49.368
What's going on with you?

40:51.991 --> 40:56.497
You used to sing in the morning
coming down the stairs.

40:58.623 --> 41:01.752
I meant to make you happy.
I wanted nothing else.

41:03.044 --> 41:05.672
But then you began to be angry with me...

41:07.048 --> 41:08.641
just for little things.

41:12.178 --> 41:16.524
<i>I don't wanna accuse you,
but you turned more unkind toward me.</i>

41:19.894 --> 41:21.441
<i>Almost cruel.</i>

41:33.658 --> 41:36.537
Just don't threaten me with leaving, okay?

41:36.703 --> 41:38.376
Just do what you wanna do!

41:42.166 --> 41:43.759
Just go!

42:08.234 --> 42:10.407
<i>Stay.</i>

42:16.242 --> 42:17.789
<i>I want you.</i>

42:22.206 --> 42:23.753
<i>Hold you.</i>

42:25.960 --> 42:28.509
<i>Have you.
Mine.</i>

42:29.338 --> 42:32.342
<i>Are you sorry
we didn't have babies?</i>

42:36.804 --> 42:38.351
<i>I am.</i>

42:45.271 --> 42:47.194
<i>Got started so late.</i>

43:22.058 --> 43:27.030
<i>You wanted me to help you
through the dangers of a young man's life.</i>

43:27.855 --> 43:29.402
<i>Ambition.</i>

43:31.234 --> 43:32.781
<i>Fear.</i>

43:36.531 --> 43:39.660
When was the last time
you took these boots off?

43:46.833 --> 43:50.007
<i>I think you were afraid
of going astray.</i>

43:53.714 --> 43:56.513
<i>I couldn't help you stay on the right path.</i>

44:01.389 --> 44:04.359
<i>Your head was turned
in the wrong direction.</i>

44:05.226 --> 44:07.524
Can you move all your fingers?

44:08.896 --> 44:11.365
Yeah, they look a little bit bruised.

44:32.879 --> 44:37.350
<i>You never really wanted
to be totally inside our marriage.</i>

44:41.596 --> 44:43.189
<i>Nor outside it, either.</i>

44:50.438 --> 44:53.237
<i>You were sincere in the promises you made.</i>

44:59.864 --> 45:05.246
<i>Still... they didn't come from your heart.</i>

45:41.697 --> 45:44.075
<i>I was afraid when I was young.</i>

45:50.706 --> 45:52.253
<i>Afraid of life.</i>

45:55.211 --> 45:56.758
<i>Who pays for it.</i>

45:59.632 --> 46:01.726
<i>I'm sorry you had to pay as well.</i>

46:24.073 --> 46:25.825
<i>My hope.</i>

46:46.554 --> 46:48.227
<i>You gave me peace.</i>

46:51.434 --> 46:53.903
<i>You gave me what the world can't give.</i>

46:57.064 --> 46:58.611
<i>Mercy.</i>

46:59.483 --> 47:01.030
<i>Love.</i>

47:02.820 --> 47:04.493
<i>Joy.</i>

47:08.659 --> 47:10.206
<i>All else is cloud.</i>

47:13.247 --> 47:14.794
<i>Mist.</i>

47:20.004 --> 47:21.551
<i>Be with me.</i>

47:25.384 --> 47:26.931
<i>Always.</i>

48:10.763 --> 48:13.437
<i>You're still the love of my life.</i>

48:18.437 --> 48:19.984
<i>Should I tell you that?</i>

49:00.187 --> 49:03.691
Drinking is bad.
But feelings are worse.

49:03.858 --> 49:07.533
Sober girls are the worst,
but so are really drunk ones.

49:07.653 --> 49:10.748
The sweet spot is one xanie,
four white wines.

49:17.288 --> 49:21.839
<i>If you're not first in line,
you're smelling somebody else's brown eye.</i>

49:22.001 --> 49:23.548
<i>Balls deep.</i>

49:25.379 --> 49:29.009
Living my life is like
playing Call of Duty on easy.

49:29.175 --> 49:31.143
I just go around and fuck shit up.

49:31.302 --> 49:34.272
<i>Why don't we take
"yes" for an answer.</i>

49:37.475 --> 49:41.446
Let me tell you about you.

49:44.440 --> 49:47.489
You worked long and hard
to get to this moment.

49:49.236 --> 49:50.783
Mountain air.

49:52.156 --> 49:54.204
Freedom.
What are you gonna do?

49:56.660 --> 50:00.210
Crawl back down because
you don't like the altitude?

50:02.291 --> 50:04.669
You have an incomparable opportunity.

50:07.087 --> 50:08.839
I told you about you.

50:09.507 --> 50:11.509
Now let me tell you about me.

50:12.510 --> 50:14.057
I wanna make you rich.

50:17.056 --> 50:19.935
Is there anyone you wanna sit
in a room with?

50:20.601 --> 50:25.323
<i>Is there anyone you wanna know?
You wanna climb your stairs, or theirs?</i>

50:28.150 --> 50:29.697
<i>Never get your shot.</i>

50:34.114 --> 50:35.661
<i>Your time on Earth.</i>

50:40.955 --> 50:42.798
<i>All you need to do is say yes.</i>

50:48.754 --> 50:50.301
<i>Nod.</i>

50:51.423 --> 50:52.970
<i>Wink.</i>

50:57.137 --> 50:58.730
<i>Where else will you go?</i>

51:03.852 --> 51:05.854
<i>It'll be the same there.</i>

51:14.071 --> 51:16.824
<i>Don't get your head
too far up your own ass.</i>

51:16.949 --> 51:20.328
<i>Once people envied
and respected me.</i>

51:20.494 --> 51:22.041
They called me in.

51:22.997 --> 51:24.544
Give me your ID's.

51:25.124 --> 51:28.549
Give me your...
give me your pass to open the doors.

51:28.711 --> 51:30.258
They have a checklist.

51:33.716 --> 51:37.812
They didn't count the pros
and cons...

51:42.182 --> 51:44.810
I gave my life up for you kids.

51:44.977 --> 51:49.858
It wasn't a noble sacrifice.
It was what we were supposed to do.

51:50.024 --> 51:52.118
It was the way I was raised.

52:07.791 --> 52:10.635
Try starving once! I've tried it.
I've done it!

52:10.794 --> 52:15.174
Now it's all over. Now it's leaving me.
Now it's going away from me.

52:16.634 --> 52:21.390
<i>You think when you reach a
certain age things will start making sense.</i>

52:24.433 --> 52:28.108
<i>Then you find out you're
just as lost as you were before.</i>

52:32.983 --> 52:35.657
<i>I suppose that's what damnation is.</i>

52:40.157 --> 52:44.333
<i>The pieces of your life
never to come together.</i>

52:48.415 --> 52:51.009
<i>Just splashed out there.</i>

53:03.722 --> 53:09.320
<i>His goods are in peace. But when
a stronger than he shall come upon you...</i>

53:09.978 --> 53:12.197
<i>This was a vision,</i>

53:12.690 --> 53:15.364
<i>nice and
clear as a mountain stream.</i>

53:17.403 --> 53:19.872
<i>The mind revealing itself to itself.</i>

53:24.243 --> 53:29.124
<i>In my vision
I was on the verandah of a vast estate,</i>

53:29.289 --> 53:32.634
<i>a palazzo of some fantastic proportion.</i>

53:38.966 --> 53:45.019
<i>There seemed to emanate from it a light
from within this gleaming, radiant marble.</i>

53:59.611 --> 54:01.454
That's good, that's good.

54:01.613 --> 54:03.035
Tuck.
Relax your mouth.

54:06.076 --> 54:09.501
Who is responsible for this clothing?
Who is it?

54:09.663 --> 54:13.588
- Can you step out of the wind?
- Stop smiling.

54:14.293 --> 54:17.012
And don't move too fast.

54:20.048 --> 54:23.052
They didn't take eighty.
Doesn't matter.

54:23.886 --> 54:25.433
<i>I had a dream.</i>

54:26.638 --> 54:28.811
Don't stare at me like this.

54:29.016 --> 54:31.644
<i>I met a woman from another world.</i>

54:34.813 --> 54:36.815
<i>I was taken up above the earth.</i>

54:40.235 --> 54:41.782
<i>I shook with fear.</i>

54:44.782 --> 54:46.329
<i>Wonder.</i>

54:50.454 --> 54:53.799
Lean into her.
Put your breasts against her back.

54:53.957 --> 54:57.632
Don't look sweet. Don't look scared.
You like this, Helen.

54:58.545 --> 55:00.092
<i>Who are you?</i>

55:01.548 --> 55:06.805
Look into the camera. Fucking make
it hard. You're a dirty, fucking bitch.

55:06.970 --> 55:12.318
Work those muscles. You're a 1975 housewife
who takes steroids and fucks girls.

55:13.852 --> 55:15.399
<i>I travel.</i>

55:17.731 --> 55:19.278
<i>A wanderer.</i>

55:21.610 --> 55:23.157
<i>A stranger.</i>

55:29.535 --> 55:31.082
<i>Like you.</i>

55:32.830 --> 55:35.504
Stop, take your hands off your hip.

55:35.666 --> 55:37.213
Hit her hard, pop.

55:39.795 --> 55:43.425
<i>I keep thinking
I can make a new start.</i>

55:43.590 --> 55:45.718
Helen?
Two weeks.

55:56.103 --> 55:58.197
Can you swim?

56:31.763 --> 56:33.731
<i>Higher.</i>

57:03.712 --> 57:05.635
Is this a friendship we have?

57:16.475 --> 57:19.479
I don't wanna wreak havoc
in men's lives anymore.

58:20.163 --> 58:22.461
<i>Oh... life.</i>

58:33.677 --> 58:35.805
<i>What do you want from me?</i>

58:43.353 --> 58:45.026
<i>To weave a spell over you?</i>

58:52.571 --> 58:54.118
<i>To make you dream?</i>

59:01.997 --> 59:03.590
<i>Dreams are nice.</i>

59:08.128 --> 59:10.005
<i>But you can't live in them.</i>

59:50.962 --> 59:54.887
<i>There's somewhere else
we need to get to.</i>

59:59.054 --> 01:00:00.601
<i>I know it.</i>

01:01:02.159 --> 01:01:04.002
<i>It comes to me now.</i>

01:01:07.747 --> 01:01:10.125
How tenderly you touched my face...

01:01:14.796 --> 01:01:16.719
<i>when you were four years old.</i>

01:01:21.303 --> 01:01:23.226
<i>And I'd bounce you on my knee.</i>

01:01:36.985 --> 01:01:38.532
<i>So much I was given.</i>

01:01:41.198 --> 01:01:43.621
<i>So much I left behind.</i>

01:01:54.044 --> 01:01:55.591
<i>Remember.</i>

01:01:59.007 --> 01:02:00.554
<i>The pearl.</i>

01:02:06.014 --> 01:02:07.561
<i>Whispering.</i>

01:02:09.935 --> 01:02:11.482
<i>Beckoning.</i>

01:02:16.066 --> 01:02:17.613
<i>Each man,</i>

01:02:18.193 --> 01:02:19.740
<i>each woman.</i>

01:02:24.824 --> 01:02:26.371
<i>A guide.</i>

01:02:27.244 --> 01:02:28.791
<i>A God.</i>

01:02:31.331 --> 01:02:34.676
...except I got better
math and science scores...

01:02:39.422 --> 01:02:41.049
<i>You live in exile.</i>

01:02:43.635 --> 01:02:45.478
<i>Stranger in a strange land.</i>

01:03:02.529 --> 01:03:04.076
<i>A Pilgrim,</i>

01:03:06.408 --> 01:03:07.955
<i>A knight.</i>

01:03:20.922 --> 01:03:22.469
<i>Find your way...</i>

01:03:26.094 --> 01:03:27.641
<i>from darkness...</i>

01:03:29.472 --> 01:03:31.019
<i>to light.</i>

01:03:43.778 --> 01:03:46.497
<i>You wanna give him a high-five?</i>

01:03:57.709 --> 01:03:58.756
Thank you.

01:03:58.918 --> 01:04:03.890
- How long will you be here?
- A week, Sara's got folks here.

01:04:04.924 --> 01:04:07.473
Have you been out here before?

01:04:09.971 --> 01:04:13.976
<i>You told me
that sometimes you felt like a spy.</i>

01:04:17.062 --> 01:04:19.281
<i>Always had to pretend.</i>

01:04:31.242 --> 01:04:32.789
<i>You were afraid.</i>

01:04:54.599 --> 01:04:58.570
<i>You would hide behind
the rocking chair before he came home</i>

01:04:58.728 --> 01:05:00.401
<i>and you'd get real stiff.</i>

01:05:05.193 --> 01:05:06.866
<i>I hope you have children.</i>

01:05:10.407 --> 01:05:16.255
<i>You're always wondering, are they too cold,
are they warm enough?</i>

01:05:17.372 --> 01:05:20.046
<i>Instead of worrying about yourselves.</i>

01:05:32.637 --> 01:05:36.392
- Don't fucking move.
- Check him for his wallet.

01:05:36.558 --> 01:05:38.105
Come on.

01:05:39.686 --> 01:05:43.111
Got 20, 40, 60.
Couple hundred.

01:05:46.067 --> 01:05:48.820
Take the TV?
You can't tow that down the street.

01:05:48.987 --> 01:05:52.241
How come you ain't got nothin'
in this house, man!

01:05:58.788 --> 01:06:02.543
- Keep looking.
- What kind of jacket is that? Take it off.

01:06:02.709 --> 01:06:05.212
Take it off. Whoa, careful.

01:06:47.879 --> 01:06:49.722
<i>I've spent 30 years.</i>

01:06:51.174 --> 01:06:52.721
<i>Not living life.</i>

01:06:54.052 --> 01:06:55.804
<i>But ruining it.</i>

01:06:57.305 --> 01:06:59.683
<i>For myself. And others.</i>

01:07:04.229 --> 01:07:05.776
<i>I can't remember...</i>

01:07:07.649 --> 01:07:09.947
<i>A man I wanted to be.</i>

01:07:35.510 --> 01:07:37.183
<i>What mood am I in?</i>

01:07:40.431 --> 01:07:41.978
<i>Tell me...</i>

01:07:45.979 --> 01:07:47.526
<i>What do I think of you?</i>

01:07:51.609 --> 01:07:53.907
<i>No one cares about reality anymore.</i>

01:08:23.224 --> 01:08:25.067
<i>What's your story?</i>

01:08:26.102 --> 01:08:27.694
<i>What's yours?</i>

01:08:30.231 --> 01:08:31.778
<i>I'm an Aussie.</i>

01:08:33.276 --> 01:08:34.823
<i>Australian.</i>

01:08:36.237 --> 01:08:39.081
<i>Yeah.
You've been there, down under?</i>

01:08:40.491 --> 01:08:42.037
What's your name?

01:08:43.703 --> 01:08:45.376
What's your name?

01:08:45.537 --> 01:08:48.837
Whatever you want it to be.
You pick.

01:08:57.466 --> 01:09:01.471
You have a darkness on you.

01:09:04.223 --> 01:09:05.725
A little shadow.

01:09:31.292 --> 01:09:34.341
You live in a little fantasy world,
don't you?

01:09:35.212 --> 01:09:36.760
Don't you?

01:09:36.923 --> 01:09:39.642
Yes. Because it's so much more fun.

01:09:40.218 --> 01:09:41.765
Do you enjoy yours?

01:09:41.928 --> 01:09:47.276
Uh-huh. Changes every day.
I can be whatever I want to be.

01:09:49.935 --> 01:09:53.566
Don't forget that.
You can be whoever you want to be.

01:10:00.154 --> 01:10:01.701
You can be an asshole.

01:10:02.824 --> 01:10:07.079
You can be a saint,
you can be a... you can be a God.

01:10:08.079 --> 01:10:11.424
I'll tell you,
but don't tell anyone, it's a secret.

01:10:19.841 --> 01:10:22.560
<i>We're like clouds, aren't we?</i>

01:10:26.264 --> 01:10:28.187
<i>Coming and going.</i>

01:10:34.564 --> 01:10:36.783
<i>There's no such thing as forever.</i>

01:10:45.283 --> 01:10:47.377
<i>The highs don't add up.</i>

01:10:50.580 --> 01:10:53.675
You liked that, didn't you?

01:11:05.303 --> 01:11:06.850
<i>Free.</i>

01:11:12.393 --> 01:11:13.940
<i>Wake up.</i>

01:11:48.012 --> 01:11:51.687
Love danger.
Like living on the edge like this.

01:11:51.849 --> 01:11:54.568
It's crazy, it's scary.
What if I get busted?

01:11:54.727 --> 01:11:58.732
Look at you with your little
eyes looking at me.

01:11:58.898 --> 01:12:03.199
Sometimes I think I know so much more
about the world than other people.

01:12:03.361 --> 01:12:09.619
You see, I took drugs once, and it kind of
opened up this window for me.

01:12:09.784 --> 01:12:11.707
I call it the Window of Truth.

01:12:11.869 --> 01:12:14.042
<i>Real life's so hard to find.</i>

01:12:14.205 --> 01:12:17.379
...I saw the world in a different way...

01:12:18.376 --> 01:12:19.923
<i>Where is it?</i>

01:12:20.962 --> 01:12:23.511
...I see things other people do not...

01:12:24.298 --> 01:12:26.596
I think you had that experience, too.

01:12:26.759 --> 01:12:28.306
<i>How do you get there?</i>

01:12:35.142 --> 01:12:38.817
<i>Get out of the big cloud of dust
everybody's kicking up.</i>

01:12:45.152 --> 01:12:47.246
<i>The only way out is in.</i>

01:12:56.163 --> 01:12:57.710
<i>Breathe.</i>

01:13:03.129 --> 01:13:05.097
<i>Your mind's a theater.</i>

01:13:11.137 --> 01:13:12.684
<i>I say, try it all.</i>

01:13:19.896 --> 01:13:21.443
<i>Why not?</i>

01:13:28.779 --> 01:13:30.873
<i>Then I fell back asleep.</i>

01:13:32.116 --> 01:13:33.663
<i>Sing for me.</i>

01:13:36.329 --> 01:13:37.876
<i>Dream another dream.</i>

01:13:59.393 --> 01:14:02.522
<i>...who laid the foundations of the earth,</i>

01:14:02.688 --> 01:14:05.237
<i>that it should not be removed for ever.</i>

01:14:05.399 --> 01:14:10.371
<i>The waters stood above the mountains.
At thy rebuke they fled,</i>

01:14:10.529 --> 01:14:13.248
<i>at the voice of thy thunder
they hasted away.</i>

01:14:13.407 --> 01:14:18.288
<i>They go down by the valleys unto the place
which thou hast founded for them.</i>

01:14:19.455 --> 01:14:22.254
<i>He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle</i>

01:14:23.751 --> 01:14:29.804
<i>and herb for the service of man that he may
bring forth food out of the earth...</i>

01:14:43.354 --> 01:14:47.734
Very loving and enchanting.
Most affectionate.

01:14:48.401 --> 01:14:49.948
Real nice to get along.

01:14:50.111 --> 01:14:51.909
Very beautiful.

01:14:52.071 --> 01:14:57.999
I like your outfit, too, especially the
boots. Now they're a touch of class.

01:14:58.160 --> 01:15:00.504
Are you a religious man?

01:15:00.663 --> 01:15:04.418
- You have a cross around your neck.
- Absolutely.

01:15:04.583 --> 01:15:09.180
Oh, even though I'm in darkness,
I believe in the light.

01:15:11.841 --> 01:15:14.469
I was instructed from some information

01:15:14.635 --> 01:15:17.730
to be no part of the world
nor of the things in it.

01:15:17.888 --> 01:15:22.359
But my eyes are now simple,
and I'm carnal when I see beautiful women

01:15:22.518 --> 01:15:26.193
and big cars and lots of money,
and I wanna be a part of it.

01:15:31.402 --> 01:15:34.997
I mean, who needs a bed
this big? Pretty good, huh?

01:15:35.156 --> 01:15:36.703
Look at you,

01:15:36.866 --> 01:15:41.588
hanging out there with your girls and your
money. Are you feeling happy?

01:15:41.746 --> 01:15:43.498
- Yes.
- It makes you happy'?

01:15:43.664 --> 01:15:48.545
- It depends who owns the money.
- It's my new fur. He bought it for me.

01:15:49.962 --> 01:15:51.760
This man is in love with me.

01:15:51.922 --> 01:15:53.640
Just some other girl.

01:15:53.799 --> 01:15:55.346
- Hi, how are you?
- Hi.

01:16:10.191 --> 01:16:12.660
<i>And the world held up a mirror.</i>

01:16:14.653 --> 01:16:16.200
<i>Here.</i>

01:16:17.656 --> 01:16:19.329
<i>Take the things you want.</i>

01:16:25.664 --> 01:16:27.337
<i>They can be yours.</i>

01:16:42.848 --> 01:16:44.395
<i>Why do you hold back?</i>

01:16:51.065 --> 01:16:53.488
I thought you were dead.

01:16:53.651 --> 01:16:57.952
- I can't believe I actually met Elvis.
- You never know in this town.

01:16:58.072 --> 01:17:01.702
That's my move.
Do you think I'll be as famous as Elvis?

01:17:20.261 --> 01:17:22.013
<i>What a fool am I?</i>

01:17:22.179 --> 01:17:25.399
<i>Just to lie in a stinking dungeon.</i>

01:17:27.351 --> 01:17:29.570
<i>When I may as well walk at liberty.</i>

01:17:30.855 --> 01:17:34.826
<i>I have a key in my bosom called promise.</i>

01:17:37.069 --> 01:17:38.662
<i>And will I am persuaded,</i>

01:17:39.530 --> 01:17:42.374
<i>open any lock in Doubting Castle.</i>

01:17:44.201 --> 01:17:46.670
<i>Though in this dark and dismal state,</i>

01:17:47.788 --> 01:17:51.418
<i>he hath turned the shadow
of death into the morning,</i>

01:19:03.113 --> 01:19:04.660
<i>Go.</i>

01:19:11.538 --> 01:19:13.336
<i>Where?</i>

01:19:28.514 --> 01:19:30.141
<i>Find it.</i>

01:19:47.825 --> 01:19:49.372
<i>How do I reach you?</i>

01:19:57.084 --> 01:19:58.631
<i>Find my way there?</i>

01:20:42.838 --> 01:20:44.511
<i>Are you afraid?</i>

01:21:27.424 --> 01:21:29.722
<i>Sweetheart, my love,</i>

01:21:29.885 --> 01:21:33.640
<i>I don't feel guilty
that I've fallen in love with you.</i>

01:21:38.435 --> 01:21:39.982
<i>I'm glad.</i>

01:21:41.563 --> 01:21:43.611
<i>Grateful I still can.</i>

01:21:53.409 --> 01:21:56.959
<i>You're afraid
you're making me break my vows.</i>

01:22:01.834 --> 01:22:04.633
<i>But the vow comes out
of the love behind it.</i>

01:22:09.216 --> 01:22:11.685
<i>Love's so rare that when you find it</i>

01:22:13.637 --> 01:22:15.184
<i>you can't doubt it.</i>

01:22:17.933 --> 01:22:19.480
<i>Let it go.</i>

01:22:48.297 --> 01:22:52.473
<i>I remember when
I came down out of the mountains</i>

01:22:52.593 --> 01:22:56.268
<i>and I was conditioned with
being absolutely clear.</i>

01:22:56.430 --> 01:22:57.977
<i>Absolutely...</i>

01:22:59.183 --> 01:23:02.528
<i>if not enlightened,
at least wiser than I had been.</i>

01:23:03.562 --> 01:23:08.614
You have to kneel in a certain way and
you have to bow at the appropriate time.

01:23:08.775 --> 01:23:13.451
And it's all beautifully timed,
even the sound of when they announce...

01:23:28.962 --> 01:23:33.058
We walked 250 miles over the mountains,

01:23:33.217 --> 01:23:35.561
into Tibet area.

01:23:36.303 --> 01:23:40.353
And every... couple days,

01:23:40.516 --> 01:23:42.063
every 20 miles or so,

01:23:42.893 --> 01:23:46.818
you knew you were
going back in history, in time...

01:23:50.400 --> 01:23:53.404
But don't forget
their life is so circumscribed.

01:23:53.570 --> 01:23:59.168
If you're living in a cave eating nettles,
it's not so difficult to keep life simple.

01:23:59.785 --> 01:24:05.508
You don't have honking horns and your wife
running in saying "You screwed up!"

01:24:05.666 --> 01:24:11.173
The distractions are very few, and that's
the great attraction of the monk's life.

01:24:12.714 --> 01:24:16.389
<i>Teaching now... I only teach one thing.</i>

01:24:18.345 --> 01:24:20.643
<i>I just teach this moment.</i>

01:24:22.558 --> 01:24:25.027
<i>Pay attention to this moment.</i>

01:24:27.729 --> 01:24:29.572
<i>And everything is there...</i>

01:24:32.234 --> 01:24:33.736
<i>perfect...</i>

01:24:36.238 --> 01:24:37.785
<i>and complete.</i>

01:24:40.867 --> 01:24:42.414
<i>Just as it is.</i>

01:25:10.355 --> 01:25:12.323
<i>You're so quiet.</i>

01:25:14.484 --> 01:25:16.703
<i>You keep everything to yourself.</i>

01:25:23.493 --> 01:25:25.040
<i>You have love in you.</i>

01:25:27.039 --> 01:25:28.586
<i>I know it.</i>

01:25:36.256 --> 01:25:37.803
<i>When I'm with you...</i>

01:25:39.134 --> 01:25:41.182
<i>I forget everything else.</i>

01:25:46.725 --> 01:25:48.693
<i>My husband...</i>

01:25:49.811 --> 01:25:51.358
<i>my life as I knew it.</i>

01:25:52.272 --> 01:25:58.575
Thumb, first finger, third
finger, left, fourth finger, third finger,

01:25:58.737 --> 01:26:05.837
<i>second finger, thumb, right hand, thumb,
first finger, second finger, thumb...</i>

01:26:08.121 --> 01:26:09.668
<i>Have I found you?</i>

01:26:22.969 --> 01:26:24.516
<i>Can it be?</i>

01:27:19.776 --> 01:27:21.323
<i>Answer me.</i>

01:27:32.164 --> 01:27:33.711
<i>So this is what we are.</i>

01:27:36.710 --> 01:27:38.257
<i>A fire.</i>

01:28:07.491 --> 01:28:09.038
<i>Come with me.</i>

01:28:19.044 --> 01:28:20.591
<i>Away.</i>

01:29:17.435 --> 01:29:18.982
Open your mouth.

01:29:41.293 --> 01:29:43.637
<i>I wanna go away with you.</i>

01:29:56.099 --> 01:29:57.646
<i>Marry you.</i>

01:30:43.063 --> 01:30:45.532
<i>Save what you can of your life.</i>

01:30:47.692 --> 01:30:49.239
<i>Look at me.</i>

01:30:53.365 --> 01:30:56.414
<i>Dan't lose it all
just because you've lost a part.</i>

01:31:53.383 --> 01:31:56.011
<i>I found out I was pregnant.</i>

01:32:01.057 --> 01:32:02.650
<i>Nate came back.</i>

01:32:10.650 --> 01:32:13.654
<i>And I wasn't sure if it was my husband's...</i>

01:32:18.658 --> 01:32:20.205
<i>or if it was yours.</i>

01:32:36.509 --> 01:32:39.183
<i>...to distract me right now</i>

01:32:39.345 --> 01:32:41.598
<i>but I wanted to tel! you, to...</i>

01:32:42.348 --> 01:32:45.443
acknowledge that it was...

01:32:49.355 --> 01:32:50.902
I wake up and...

01:32:52.817 --> 01:32:55.866
I forget about it
for a few minutes and then...

01:32:59.657 --> 01:33:01.534
and then I remember.

01:33:09.042 --> 01:33:14.139
She's like "I had four of them.
You have to get over it and stop crying."

01:33:45.954 --> 01:33:47.877
<i>What are we now?</i>

01:34:37.463 --> 01:34:39.010
<i>Forgive me.</i>

01:36:22.402 --> 01:36:26.452
<i>There's so much love inside us.</i>

01:36:31.744 --> 01:36:33.291
<i>That never gets out.</i>

01:36:58.813 --> 01:37:00.486
<i>Have mercy on me.</i>

01:37:03.401 --> 01:37:05.699
<i>According to your unfailing love,</i>

01:37:08.990 --> 01:37:11.209
<i>your great compassion,</i>

01:37:13.077 --> 01:37:15.830
<i>blot out my transgressions.</i>

01:37:39.562 --> 01:37:41.109
<i>My son.</i>

01:37:44.442 --> 01:37:45.989
<i>I know you.</i>

01:37:52.283 --> 01:37:54.206
<i>I know you have a soul.</i>

01:38:15.139 --> 01:38:17.483
<i>Seems you're alone.</i>

01:38:19.143 --> 01:38:20.690
<i>You're not.</i>

01:38:22.397 --> 01:38:26.652
<i>Even now,
He's taking your hand and guiding you</i>

01:38:26.818 --> 01:38:28.365
<i>by a way you cannot see.</i>

01:38:30.363 --> 01:38:34.664
If you are unhappy, you shouldn't
take it as a mark of God's disfavor.

01:38:36.327 --> 01:38:40.958
Just the contrary.
Might be the very sign He loves you.

01:38:41.124 --> 01:38:45.800
He shows His love
not by helping you avoid suffering,

01:38:45.962 --> 01:38:49.182
by sending you suffering,

01:38:51.968 --> 01:38:53.515
<i>by keeping you there.</i>

01:38:57.473 --> 01:39:01.068
To suffer binds you to something
higher than yourself,

01:39:01.227 --> 01:39:03.275
higher than your own will.

01:39:03.438 --> 01:39:05.281
Takes you from the world

01:39:06.107 --> 01:39:09.361
to find what lies beyond it.

01:39:13.698 --> 01:39:18.750
<i>We are not only to endure
patiently the troubles He sends,</i>

01:39:18.911 --> 01:39:20.913
<i>we are to regard them as gifts.</i>

01:39:25.042 --> 01:39:28.262
<i>As gifts more precious</i>

01:39:28.379 --> 01:39:31.223
<i>than the happiness we wish for ourselves.</i>

01:39:49.400 --> 01:39:51.323
<i>Just left you behind.</i>

01:39:55.948 --> 01:39:57.666
<i>To get burned up.</i>

01:41:09.146 --> 01:41:10.693
<i>How do I begin?</i>

01:42:02.241 --> 01:42:03.743
<i>Father.</i>

01:42:10.082 --> 01:42:11.629
<i>Give me courage.</i>

01:42:16.797 --> 01:42:18.344
<i>Strength.</i>

01:42:21.344 --> 01:42:23.096
<i>I'm proud of you.</i>

01:42:24.388 --> 01:42:25.935
<i>You've done well.</i>

01:42:29.810 --> 01:42:31.608
<i>Better than me.</i>

01:42:33.856 --> 01:42:36.234
<i>Which is the way it's supposed to be.</i>

01:44:29.263 --> 01:44:32.233
<i>Find the light
you know in the east.</i>

01:44:34.810 --> 01:44:36.483
<i>As a child.</i>

01:44:42.026 --> 01:44:43.573
<i>The moon.</i>

01:44:45.112 --> 01:44:46.659
<i>The stars.</i>

01:44:53.454 --> 01:44:55.377
<i>They serve you.</i>

01:44:58.375 --> 01:45:00.377
<i>They guide you on your way.</i>

01:45:07.718 --> 01:45:10.221
<i>The light in the eyes of others.</i>

01:45:17.019 --> 01:45:18.566
<i>The pearl.</i>
