That's not true.

27:15.916 --> 27:18.623
So you must be plain stupid. Is that it?

27:18.708 --> 27:21.370
You don't know the difference
between right and wrong?

27:21.958 --> 27:23.994
I know the difference.

27:24.083 --> 27:26.324
So you're selfish?

27:31.000 --> 27:33.457
Are you going to apologise
to your niece?

27:33.541 --> 27:35.532
It's OK...
— Be quiet!

27:39.375 --> 27:40.785
I'm sorry.

Hey.

31:02.250 --> 31:04.241
Can we talk about something else?

31:04.333 --> 31:07.325
