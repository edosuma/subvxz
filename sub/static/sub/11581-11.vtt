00:01.335 --> 00:03.237
NARRATOR:
In the criminal justice system,

00:03.271 --> 00:06.040
sexually based offenses are
considered especially heinous.

00:06.074 --> 00:08.209
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:08.242 --> 00:10.211
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:10.244 --> 00:11.545
are members of an elite squad

00:11.579 --> 00:13.381
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:13.414 --> 00:16.084
These are their stories.

00:17.618 --> 00:19.287
Let's go,
get a move on.

00:19.320 --> 00:20.654
Don't mess with me, hack.

00:20.688 --> 00:21.755
You know what I'm in for?

00:21.789 --> 00:24.792
Yeah, yeah. Whatever it is,
I'm sure you didn't do it.

00:26.627 --> 00:28.162
Come on.

00:29.163 --> 00:30.764
( muffled yells )

00:30.798 --> 00:32.666
What the hell?

00:33.667 --> 00:35.569
Yo. Yo.

00:35.603 --> 00:36.604
My cuffs, man.

00:36.637 --> 00:39.173
( muffled yells )

00:41.809 --> 00:45.713
( muffled yells continue )

00:47.848 --> 00:49.717
Edwards!

00:49.750 --> 00:51.752
What happened?

00:51.785 --> 00:53.587
Gamble and Baxter jumped me.

00:53.621 --> 00:55.256
Lock it down! Lock it down!

00:55.289 --> 00:58.126
Officer injured,
two men escaped.

00:58.159 --> 01:00.261
MAN:
Your fugitives
are Dion Dwayne Gamble,

01:00.294 --> 01:01.762
aka Double D.

01:01.795 --> 01:04.232
Murdering dope dealer
in for life.

01:04.265 --> 01:06.234
And Michael Baxter,
kiddie rapist.

01:06.267 --> 01:08.469
Five years left
on his sentence.

01:08.502 --> 01:09.703
How'd your
inmates escape?

01:09.737 --> 01:11.105
Knocked out Officer Edwards.

01:11.139 --> 01:12.473
Baxter put on his uniform,

01:12.506 --> 01:14.275
pretended
to be escorting Gamble...

01:14.308 --> 01:15.743
And strolled right out.

01:15.776 --> 01:17.745
Your COs sleeping or
are they just morons?

01:17.778 --> 01:19.447
Give it a rest,
Eckerson.

01:19.480 --> 01:21.615
Double D hails
from Houston, Texas.

01:21.649 --> 01:23.117
Good idea as any
he's heading home.

01:23.151 --> 01:24.485
I'll send a team down there.

01:24.518 --> 01:26.454
Baxter was living here
in Virginia, so...

01:26.487 --> 01:27.888
For what it's
worth, Marshal,

01:27.921 --> 01:29.823
a reliable inmate
heard Baxter

01:29.857 --> 01:31.859
yapping about heading back
to New York City

01:31.892 --> 01:33.127
to tie up some loose ends.

01:33.161 --> 01:35.796
His ex-girlfriend Carin
lives there.

01:35.829 --> 01:38.732
Baxter raped her son.

01:38.766 --> 01:40.168
I've got a grand jury in an hour

01:40.201 --> 01:41.469
on the Wellman
pedophile case.

01:41.502 --> 01:43.471
Well, if I catch, I'll pull Fin.

01:43.504 --> 01:44.738
CRAGEN:
Detectives...

01:44.772 --> 01:46.540
Olivia Benson,
Elliot Stabler,

01:46.574 --> 01:48.576
Deputy U.S. Marshal
Andy Eckerson.

01:48.609 --> 01:49.643
Andy.

01:49.677 --> 01:50.778
Hey, guys.

01:50.811 --> 01:52.446
Nice to see you.

01:52.480 --> 01:54.782
Deputy Eckerson
is requesting our assistance.

01:54.815 --> 01:56.184
Wow!

01:56.217 --> 01:57.585
Pigs really do fly, huh?

01:57.618 --> 01:59.753
We've got an escaped con
from Virginia

01:59.787 --> 02:01.789
named Michael Baxter,
may be headed this way.

02:01.822 --> 02:02.790
Why here?

02:02.823 --> 02:03.857
Baxter's ex-girlfriend,

02:03.891 --> 02:05.659
Carin Healy, and her son, Lee,

02:05.693 --> 02:07.661
moved to New York
about ten years ago,

02:07.695 --> 02:10.631
right after Lee testified
against Baxter for raping him.

02:10.664 --> 02:12.366
You think it's payback?
Yeah.

02:12.400 --> 02:14.868
You guys know how to deal
with rape victims.

02:14.902 --> 02:15.936
We could use your help.

02:15.969 --> 02:17.671
Okay, let's go talk to him.

02:17.705 --> 02:18.739
Can't.

02:18.772 --> 02:21.709
Carin and Lee must've changed
their last names.

02:21.742 --> 02:23.777
We can't find a listing
for either one of them.

02:23.811 --> 02:25.379
You pull a social
off recent W-2s?

02:25.413 --> 02:26.914
The results will be faxed here
any minute.

02:26.947 --> 02:28.449
Elliot, you're going
to be late for court.

02:28.482 --> 02:29.750
Olivia, work this
with the marshal.

02:29.783 --> 02:32.420
Sure.

02:32.453 --> 02:33.721
Let's see if
your fax came in.

02:35.723 --> 02:37.191
Elliot?

02:37.225 --> 02:38.826
How do you know Eckerson?

02:38.859 --> 02:42.530
Before Andy went federal,
he was NYPD.

02:42.563 --> 02:46.234
Oh, and he also
used to date Olivia.

02:49.503 --> 02:53.741
Captioning sponsored by
UNIVERSAL NETWORK TELEVISION

03:34.948 --> 03:35.783
You used to like
a challenge.
I still do.

03:36.617 --> 03:38.319
Good, then try
and keep your mouth shut,

03:38.352 --> 03:39.987
and let me take the lead
on the interview.

03:40.020 --> 03:41.522
You know, I don't
just kick doors down.

03:41.555 --> 03:42.656
I can actually
talk to people.

03:42.690 --> 03:45.726
Well, you asked us for our help
because we know victims.

03:45.759 --> 03:47.761
Or did you come back
for another reason?

03:51.565 --> 03:52.766
Carin?

03:52.800 --> 03:54.302
WOMAN:
Yes?

03:54.335 --> 03:56.370
Detective Olivia Benson,
Special Victims Unit.

03:56.404 --> 03:57.971
This is Deputy Marshall
Andy Eckerson.

03:58.005 --> 03:59.973
Can we have a word
with you privately?

04:00.007 --> 04:03.444
It's okay.
Jeremy's my nephew.

04:03.477 --> 04:04.945
You're here
about Mike Baxter, right?

04:04.978 --> 04:05.879
News said he escaped
from prison.

04:05.913 --> 04:07.915
You don't think he'll
come here, do you?

04:07.948 --> 04:09.082
ECKERSON:
Well, we don't know,

04:09.116 --> 04:11.852
but until he's recaptured,
your safest bet is to stay home.

04:11.885 --> 04:12.853
We'll post officers

04:12.886 --> 04:13.821
outside your apartment.

04:13.854 --> 04:14.688
Carin, we're going to
need your son's address.

04:14.722 --> 04:16.790
You think that bastard
will go after him?

04:16.824 --> 04:18.292
We don't want
to take any chances.

04:18.326 --> 04:19.693
He moved in with
his girlfriend

04:19.727 --> 04:21.762
a couple of months ago--
114 West 37th.

04:21.795 --> 04:23.063
Wait.

04:23.096 --> 04:25.899
What if Mike's after Danny?

04:25.933 --> 04:28.068
Who's Danny?

04:28.101 --> 04:29.770
My younger son.

04:29.803 --> 04:32.306
I was pregnant
when Mike was arrested.

04:32.340 --> 04:33.741
He's Danny's father.

04:33.774 --> 04:36.076
BENSON:
Does Danny know his father

04:36.109 --> 04:37.445
was in prison?

04:37.478 --> 04:39.447
I told him he was dead.

04:39.480 --> 04:41.449
I don't see him.
He's got to be here.

04:41.482 --> 04:42.850
All right, what's
does he look like?

04:42.883 --> 04:44.618
A couple inches shorter
than me, brown hair.

04:44.652 --> 04:47.488
Daniel! Daniel!

04:47.521 --> 04:48.789
Mom?

04:48.822 --> 04:50.824
What are you doing here?

04:50.858 --> 04:52.793
Get your things.
We're going home.

04:52.826 --> 04:54.328
In the middle of the day?

04:54.362 --> 04:55.729
What's wrong?

04:55.763 --> 04:57.598
Just do as I say.

04:58.632 --> 05:00.834
Just the thought of Mike
coming anywhere near Danny...

05:00.868 --> 05:02.736
We're going to make sure
that doesn't happen.

05:02.770 --> 05:05.038
Fugitive Detail's on their
way to Lee's apartment.

05:05.072 --> 05:06.006
We'll escort you home.

05:06.039 --> 05:08.409
Is there anyone else
that Baxter might go to?

05:08.442 --> 05:09.610
His mother, Sheila.

05:09.643 --> 05:11.111
They're still close.

05:11.144 --> 05:12.613
Grandma ever
talk to Lee?

05:12.646 --> 05:14.882
She asked for his address
last month.

05:14.915 --> 05:17.518
She wanted to send him
a birthday card.

05:17.551 --> 05:20.020
Okay. Come on.
We should go.

05:22.390 --> 05:25.125
MAN:
You think Baxter
will come here?

05:25.158 --> 05:26.860
After all these years?

05:26.894 --> 05:28.962
I was just a freakin' kid.

05:28.996 --> 05:30.097
How will you protect us?

05:30.130 --> 05:31.999
BENSON:
We're going to put
a radio car out front.

05:32.032 --> 05:33.567
That's supposed to stop him?

05:33.601 --> 05:35.703
We can move you,
put you up in a hotel.

05:35.736 --> 05:37.505
Sweetie,
maybe we should do that.

05:37.538 --> 05:39.673
So now I'm a prisoner?

05:39.707 --> 05:42.543
What about my job?

05:42.576 --> 05:44.845
I-I have to go to work.

05:44.878 --> 05:46.714
ECKERSON:
Well, until
Baxter's caught,

05:46.747 --> 05:48.582
you should work
out of your home.

05:49.717 --> 05:51.519
( sighs )

05:51.552 --> 05:53.120
You know, not a day goes by,

05:53.153 --> 05:56.056
that I don't think about
what that bastard did to me.

05:56.089 --> 05:57.525
I changed my last name.

05:57.558 --> 05:58.859
My phone number's unlisted.

05:58.892 --> 05:59.793
I thought I was safe.

05:59.827 --> 06:02.530
Baxter's mother knows
where you live, right?

06:02.563 --> 06:04.164
Sheila wouldn't help
that pervert.

06:04.197 --> 06:06.099
She knows what he did to me.

06:06.133 --> 06:07.635
She wouldn't help him.

06:07.668 --> 06:10.938
Maybe she wants to see him
before it's too late.

06:10.971 --> 06:13.474
Too late for what?

06:13.507 --> 06:15.809
She's dying of cancer.

06:17.845 --> 06:21.882
I heard about the escape
this morning, on the radio.

06:21.915 --> 06:24.051
BENSON:
Has your son
contacted you?

06:24.084 --> 06:25.152
No.

06:25.185 --> 06:28.422
He ever mention that he might
try something like this?

06:28.456 --> 06:29.490
Not that I can remember.

06:29.523 --> 06:30.558
Ma'am, sometimes
we think back

06:30.591 --> 06:31.959
on conversations
that we've had,

06:31.992 --> 06:35.062
little things that
didn't make sense then

06:35.095 --> 06:36.430
make sense now.

06:36.464 --> 06:37.598
What are you insinuating?

06:37.631 --> 06:39.166
We haven't spoken in months.

06:39.199 --> 06:40.534
Still, you're
his mother.

06:40.568 --> 06:42.736
Nobody knows him better
than you.

06:42.770 --> 06:46.574
I'll never stop loving my son...

06:46.607 --> 06:49.076
but he destroyed Lee's life.

06:49.109 --> 06:50.478
He should be in jail.

06:50.511 --> 06:52.012
Mrs. Baxter, does
your son know

06:52.045 --> 06:54.114
that you're sick?
I haven't told him.

06:54.147 --> 06:56.517
You understand that
if he contacts you,

06:56.550 --> 06:58.619
you need to report it.

06:58.652 --> 06:59.419
I know. I will.

06:59.453 --> 07:01.555
No, you won't.
You'd do anything

07:01.589 --> 07:04.024
to see him one last
time before you die.

07:04.057 --> 07:07.127
If I were your son,
I'd do anything to see you.

07:07.160 --> 07:08.562
But if we find out

07:08.596 --> 07:11.732
that you've been
concealing information,

07:11.765 --> 07:15.736
I'll arrest you, sick or not.

07:18.872 --> 07:20.508
Why didn't you just
slap her around?

07:20.541 --> 07:21.642
It would've been
more effective.

07:21.675 --> 07:23.944
That woman knows a hell
of a lot more than she's saying.

07:23.977 --> 07:25.979
She admitted that
he was guilty.
Give her a break.

07:26.013 --> 07:26.914
Oh, come on, Olivia.

07:26.947 --> 07:28.816
She's playing you,
and you're falling for it

07:28.849 --> 07:30.518
because the sweet old lady
is dying.

07:30.551 --> 07:32.586
God, you're even more
cynical than I remember.

07:32.620 --> 07:34.988
Why, because I chase criminals
and you baby-sit victims?

07:35.022 --> 07:38.158
You know, even when
you were a detective,

07:38.191 --> 07:39.660
it was never
about the victims.

07:39.693 --> 07:41.662
It's always been about
the rush with you.

07:41.695 --> 07:43.163
You liked it
when you first met me.

07:43.196 --> 07:44.532
Yeah, till I realized

07:44.565 --> 07:45.666
it would put you
in a body bag.

07:45.699 --> 07:48.201
( phone rings )

07:49.570 --> 07:51.672
Eckerson.

07:51.705 --> 07:54.174
Yeah. Okay, we're on our way.

07:54.207 --> 07:56.944
Kid just spotted our second
escapee on 44th and Seventh.

07:56.977 --> 07:59.613
MAN:
Yeah, it was the guy
on the news all right.

07:59.647 --> 08:01.114
He walked right past here.

08:01.148 --> 08:02.683
He with anyone?
Some ugly white chick.

08:02.716 --> 08:03.483
So how much do I get?

08:03.517 --> 08:05.085
Hey, we're not
offering a reward.

08:05.118 --> 08:07.020
Wait, I put my neck
on the line for nothing?

08:07.054 --> 08:08.188
Now you know how we feel.

08:08.221 --> 08:09.322
Look, it would really
help us out here

08:09.356 --> 08:11.692
if you just tell us which
direction they were going.

08:11.725 --> 08:12.860
Downtown, I guess.

08:12.893 --> 08:14.194
Can you describe
the woman?

08:14.227 --> 08:16.697
Dark hair, kind of tall.

08:16.730 --> 08:18.198
Thanks,
you've been very helpful.

08:18.231 --> 08:20.868
Fine, don't believe me,
but I know I saw him.

08:20.901 --> 08:22.035
Thanks.

08:22.069 --> 08:23.904
MAN:
Flags indicate

08:23.937 --> 08:26.540
82 reported sightings,
none confirmed.

08:26.574 --> 08:27.608
We do have one solid lead

08:27.641 --> 08:29.743
from a trucker who picked
up Baxter and Double D

08:29.777 --> 08:31.211
outside of a Chevron
in Richmond.

08:31.244 --> 08:32.546
How far did he take them?

08:32.580 --> 08:33.714
Jersey City.

08:33.747 --> 08:34.915
Dropped them at an outlet mall

08:34.948 --> 08:36.550
near the entrance to
the Holland Tunnel.

08:36.584 --> 08:38.686
Well, the easiest way
to the city from there

08:38.719 --> 08:40.053
is to take the Path train,
or a bus.

08:40.087 --> 08:41.589
I bet they're on the way
to get Lee.

08:41.622 --> 08:42.990
Women. You think
with your head.

08:43.023 --> 08:44.725
These guys think
with their peckers.

08:44.758 --> 08:45.926
First place they're going to go

08:45.959 --> 08:47.595
is for a drink
and a piece of ass.

08:47.628 --> 08:49.730
Or maybe that kid's
tip was legit.

08:49.763 --> 08:51.599
Could've seen Double D
with a hooker.

08:51.632 --> 08:53.601
So we hit every rat hole,
every hooker stroll

08:53.634 --> 08:56.069
within a mile of the Path
and Port Authority.

08:56.103 --> 08:58.772
911 call
from Lee's girlfriend.

09:00.608 --> 09:01.642
I told Lee to stay home,

09:01.675 --> 09:03.210
but he couldn't miss
a big meeting.

09:03.243 --> 09:05.312
Then his office called,
said he didn't show up.

09:05.345 --> 09:06.847
I never saw Lee
exit the premises.

09:06.880 --> 09:08.248
How many cars went out?

09:08.281 --> 09:09.983
Two.

09:10.017 --> 09:11.619
An old black guy, silver caddy;

09:11.652 --> 09:12.753
white female, tan Honda.

09:12.786 --> 09:14.622
That's Lee's car.

09:15.656 --> 09:17.958
Over there.
That's our spot.

09:24.297 --> 09:26.634
Looks like fresh blood.

09:26.667 --> 09:29.102
Oh, my God.

09:30.270 --> 09:32.272
There's something over here.

09:35.976 --> 09:37.745
You recognize this?

09:37.778 --> 09:39.112
It's Lee's.

09:39.146 --> 09:40.781
I gave it to him for Christmas.

09:40.814 --> 09:42.282
Describe the driver.

09:42.315 --> 09:45.619
White female, dark hair,
glasses, kind of butch.

09:45.653 --> 09:47.955
No one else in the car.

09:47.988 --> 09:50.290
Bodega boy didn't see Double D
with a hooker.

09:50.323 --> 09:53.193
It was Baxter, in drag.

09:59.266 --> 10:00.267
Marshals are searching the
area around Lee's apartment.

10:01.902 --> 10:03.070
Lee could already be dead.

10:03.103 --> 10:04.905
Look, if Baxter just
wanted to kill Lee,

10:04.938 --> 10:06.774
he would've left his
body in that garage.

10:06.807 --> 10:07.975
This is a kidnap.

10:08.008 --> 10:09.076
Ransom or revenge?

10:09.109 --> 10:10.143
Even money on revenge.

10:10.177 --> 10:12.245
Lee's testimony put Baxter
in prison for ten years.

10:12.279 --> 10:13.781
He wants to make
this kid suffer.

10:13.814 --> 10:14.748
FIN:
He already has.

10:14.782 --> 10:16.950
The lab says the blood
in the garage was Lee's.

10:16.984 --> 10:20.020
Baxter roughed him up before
he shoved him in that trunk.

10:20.053 --> 10:21.221
We watching Baxter's mother?

10:21.254 --> 10:22.956
We've got a team
on the house,

10:22.990 --> 10:25.358
phones tapped, but so far
sonny boy's a no-show.

10:25.392 --> 10:26.994
Well, he's got no money,
so he can't go far.

10:27.027 --> 10:28.161
We flagged Lee's credit cards,

10:28.195 --> 10:29.262
in case Baxter
tries to use them.

10:29.296 --> 10:32.065
Double D and Baxter were
together before the kidnap.

10:32.099 --> 10:33.967
They might try to hook up again.

10:34.001 --> 10:37.104
Andy's out canvassing the area
where Double D was spotted.

10:37.137 --> 10:39.106
He got any other
friends on the outside?

10:39.139 --> 10:42.042
Warden says he's got no visitors
from around here.

10:42.075 --> 10:43.711
All right, we're going
to have to check

10:43.744 --> 10:44.812
his prison phone records.

10:44.845 --> 10:46.146
John, call Virginia.

10:46.179 --> 10:48.982
I want the name of
every person he talked
to in the past year.

10:49.016 --> 10:50.083
Speaking of visitors.

10:51.118 --> 10:54.054
He called the house.

10:54.087 --> 10:57.825
CARIN:
Danny answered the phone
and Mike told him who he was.

10:57.858 --> 10:59.126
Now my son wants to know

10:59.159 --> 11:01.294
why I told him his
father was dead.

11:01.328 --> 11:03.463
Did Baxter say
where he was?

11:03.496 --> 11:05.298
No.

11:05.332 --> 11:07.134
I grabbed the
phone from Danny,

11:07.167 --> 11:10.137
and Mike said he had Lee
and they needed to talk.

11:10.170 --> 11:12.139
Then he just hung up.

11:12.172 --> 11:14.474
Did Baxter say where he was
headed, if he was calling back?

11:14.507 --> 11:15.442
Just that they were going

11:15.475 --> 11:19.112
someplace safe,
and that I shouldn't worry.

11:19.146 --> 11:20.948
That Lee was all right.

11:20.981 --> 11:22.249
I'll have Detective Munch
take you home.

11:22.282 --> 11:23.984
No, I don't want to go home.

11:24.017 --> 11:25.485
Can't we just wait here?

11:25.518 --> 11:26.619
Well, actually,

11:26.653 --> 11:29.823
we need you at your apartment
in case he calls again.

11:29.857 --> 11:31.458
What if he does?
We have a trap
on your line.

11:31.491 --> 11:32.459
The second he calls,

11:32.492 --> 11:33.493
we'll know where he is.

11:33.526 --> 11:34.828
( knocking on door )

11:34.862 --> 11:36.229
Olivia.

11:36.263 --> 11:38.331
Excuse me.

11:38.365 --> 11:39.800
Andy just called.

11:39.833 --> 11:41.869
He's got a lead
on Double D.

11:44.237 --> 11:47.007
ECKERSON:
The desk clerk hit
on Double D's photo.

11:47.040 --> 11:48.175
He's in Room 213.

11:48.208 --> 11:49.142
ESU secured all exits.

11:49.176 --> 11:51.144
We're good to go.

11:53.146 --> 11:54.181
Hit it.

11:55.382 --> 11:58.018
U.S. marshals! Show your hands!

11:58.051 --> 11:59.286
Now!

11:59.319 --> 12:01.021
Easy man.
I ain't got no gun.

12:01.054 --> 12:02.389
You ain't kidding.

12:02.422 --> 12:04.057
Put her in the car.

12:04.091 --> 12:06.093
Damn! You know
how long it's been

12:06.126 --> 12:06.860
since I had some ass?

12:06.894 --> 12:09.196
Where's Baxter?
Hell if I know.

12:09.229 --> 12:10.964
Wrong answer. Try again.

12:10.998 --> 12:11.932
Make me, bitch.

12:11.965 --> 12:13.366
( grunts )

12:13.400 --> 12:14.935
Watch your mouth.
You hear me?

12:14.968 --> 12:16.770
You want to try that
one more time?

12:18.571 --> 12:20.841
Look, I'm going to tell you
all again, all right?

12:20.874 --> 12:22.042
We split up hours ago.

12:22.075 --> 12:23.343
I don't know where he at.

12:23.376 --> 12:24.812
Mm-hmm.

12:24.845 --> 12:27.214
On my mama's life,
man, I don't know.

12:27.247 --> 12:28.415
Your mama's dead, moron.
Let's go.

12:28.448 --> 12:31.318
You know, those guards
are going to be so happy
to see you.

12:31.351 --> 12:32.986
Especially
after the hurt

12:33.020 --> 12:35.088
you put on Edwards
during your break.

12:35.122 --> 12:36.489
It didn't go down like that.

12:36.523 --> 12:38.859
Yeah, well, I got to tell you,
guards get really angry

12:38.892 --> 12:40.493
when a brother officer
is injured on the job.

12:40.527 --> 12:43.196
Edwards? He was in on it.

12:45.065 --> 12:47.567
FIN:
Looks like Double D

12:47.600 --> 12:48.969
was telling the truth.

12:49.002 --> 12:50.103
First time for everything.

12:50.137 --> 12:51.972
Officer Edwards is dirty
as hell.

12:52.005 --> 12:53.206
Four months ago,

12:53.240 --> 12:54.341
he found himself
a fairy godmother.

12:54.374 --> 12:57.044
She's already gifted him
with 15 grand in money orders.

12:57.077 --> 12:57.878
You trace them?

12:57.911 --> 12:58.879
Yeah, right back
to Sheila Baxter.

12:58.912 --> 13:01.114
FIN:
She's been playing
you from the jump.

13:01.148 --> 13:02.850
We got the prison LUDs.

13:02.883 --> 13:05.185
Baby boy calls Mama every day.

13:05.218 --> 13:06.854
SHEILA:
I just wanted

13:06.887 --> 13:08.021
to see my son before I died.

13:08.055 --> 13:10.991
BENSON:
So, you should have
visited him in prison.

13:11.024 --> 13:12.826
He didn't want me
to see him caged

13:12.860 --> 13:13.994
like a criminal.

13:14.027 --> 13:15.328
ECKERSON:
He is a criminal.

13:15.362 --> 13:17.464
He raped an 11-year-old kid.

13:17.497 --> 13:19.099
Michael swears he's innocent.

13:19.132 --> 13:20.400
Well, if Michael
didn't attack Lee,

13:20.433 --> 13:21.568
then who did?

13:21.601 --> 13:23.303
I don't know,
and neither does Michael.

13:23.336 --> 13:25.238
That's why he wanted
to write Lee a letter,

13:25.272 --> 13:26.273
to find out the truth.

13:26.306 --> 13:28.175
You want to know
what the truth is?

13:28.208 --> 13:29.609
Michael only wanted
Lee's address

13:29.642 --> 13:30.978
so he could kidnap him.

13:31.011 --> 13:32.379
( sighs )

13:32.412 --> 13:34.281
Michael just wanted
to talk to him.

13:34.314 --> 13:35.849
He would never hurt Lee.

13:35.883 --> 13:37.050
He already has.

13:37.084 --> 13:38.251
He's splattered

13:38.285 --> 13:40.620
Lee's blood all over
that garage.

13:40.653 --> 13:42.856
That must have been an accident.

13:42.890 --> 13:45.225
My son is innocent,
and his lawyer will prove it.

13:45.258 --> 13:46.526
What lawyer?

13:46.559 --> 13:49.629
Isaac Sage
of the Innocence Project.

13:49.662 --> 13:50.964
He believes Michael.

13:50.998 --> 13:52.299
He just doesn't
have enough

13:52.332 --> 13:54.301
evidence to overturn
the conviction.

13:54.334 --> 13:55.502
And let me guess.

13:55.535 --> 13:58.305
You helped your son break out
of prison

13:58.338 --> 14:01.108
so that he could find
the evidence.

14:02.142 --> 14:04.277
I'm a good mother.

14:04.311 --> 14:07.080
I don't have much time.

14:07.114 --> 14:09.917
You broke the law.

14:11.218 --> 14:14.054
I have nothing to say.

14:14.087 --> 14:17.224
Lock me up,
or let me go get my chemo.

14:17.257 --> 14:19.292
CRAGEN:
Let her go,

14:19.326 --> 14:20.127
but have an
officer escort her

14:20.160 --> 14:21.995
to the hospital
and bring her back

14:22.029 --> 14:23.163
after her treatment.

14:23.196 --> 14:24.131
She's not going to talk.

14:24.164 --> 14:25.999
She's a sick old lady,
clinging to the hope

14:26.033 --> 14:26.866
that her son's innocent.

14:26.900 --> 14:28.568
He who lives on hope
dies of starvation.

14:28.601 --> 14:29.836
She knows that he's guilty,

14:29.869 --> 14:32.539
but she needs to believe in his
innocence to justify the escape.

14:32.572 --> 14:35.342
We have to break her
before he kills Lee.

14:35.375 --> 14:37.077
She talks
about this lawyer

14:37.110 --> 14:38.245
like he's her last salvation.

14:38.278 --> 14:39.913
Maybe she confided in him.

14:39.947 --> 14:43.083
John, go see this Isaac Sage.

14:43.116 --> 14:44.184
Ask him if the old gal

14:44.217 --> 14:46.987
was planning a
family reunion.

14:47.020 --> 14:48.121
All right.

14:48.155 --> 14:49.556
SAGE:
If I'd known

14:49.589 --> 14:52.059
about the escape,
I would have reported it.

14:52.092 --> 14:54.061
I only try
to free prisoners legally.

14:54.094 --> 14:55.662
Yeah, looks like
you're pretty busy.

14:55.695 --> 14:57.330
Every inmate in
the country wants

14:57.364 --> 14:58.331
his case reopened.

14:58.365 --> 15:00.433
DNA tests are unlocking a lot
of jail cells.

15:00.467 --> 15:02.069
How's that going
to help Baxter?

15:02.102 --> 15:03.370
His DNA put him away.

15:03.403 --> 15:04.404
It's won't.

15:04.437 --> 15:07.374
The kid accused him,
rape kit confirmed sodomy,

15:07.407 --> 15:09.576
and the crime lab found
a DNA match.

15:09.609 --> 15:11.578
The trial was
properly conducted,

15:11.611 --> 15:13.013
and Baxter was more

15:13.046 --> 15:14.181
than adequately
defended.

15:14.214 --> 15:15.282
Which you told him?

15:15.315 --> 15:16.616
I sent him a letter
four months ago.

15:16.649 --> 15:18.151
I said the conviction was fair,

15:18.185 --> 15:19.286
and that he'd run out
of options.

15:19.319 --> 15:23.123
Well, how about helping us
give Mom a reality check?

15:26.059 --> 15:28.028
SHEILA:
Mr. Sage, thank God

15:28.061 --> 15:29.196
you're here.

15:29.229 --> 15:30.397
She won't believe me.

15:30.430 --> 15:32.332
Tell her Michael
didn't do it.

15:32.365 --> 15:34.701
I can't,
Mrs. Baxter.

15:34.734 --> 15:36.236
I rechecked
everything.

15:36.269 --> 15:39.039
The trial transcripts,
the evidence.

15:39.072 --> 15:40.273
There's no doubt

15:40.307 --> 15:42.242
in my mind
that Michael is guilty.

15:42.275 --> 15:45.078
He raped Lee.

15:45.112 --> 15:46.980
He told me you believe him.

15:47.014 --> 15:48.215
I told your son

15:48.248 --> 15:50.250
there was nothing
I could do.

15:50.283 --> 15:53.120
BENSON:
Sheila...

15:53.153 --> 15:54.287
please,

15:54.321 --> 15:55.688
Michael is running out of time.

15:55.722 --> 15:57.257
Help us save Lee.

15:57.290 --> 15:59.292
Tell us where he is.

16:00.460 --> 16:01.528
I don't know.

16:01.561 --> 16:02.729
Yes, you do.

16:02.762 --> 16:04.164
He knows that
you're sick,

16:04.197 --> 16:05.465
and you were
going to meet him.

16:05.498 --> 16:07.467
You were going to see
him one last time.

16:09.336 --> 16:11.271
Sheila, your son is armed.

16:11.304 --> 16:13.073
He's holding a hostage.

16:14.474 --> 16:16.443
Now, if the marshals
find him first,

16:16.476 --> 16:18.378
they may have
to kill him.

16:18.411 --> 16:19.712
( crying )

16:19.746 --> 16:20.847
You tell me
where he is,

16:20.880 --> 16:25.318
and I promise you, I will try
to bring him in safely.

16:34.494 --> 16:36.496
He's down the Shore.

16:39.499 --> 16:41.434
We used to go there
when Michael was little.

16:43.236 --> 16:45.004
Where?

16:49.276 --> 16:51.378
Cape May.

16:54.347 --> 16:57.016
He was going to call
when he got a motel room.

16:59.486 --> 17:01.721
Not a lot of motels
open this time of
year at the Shore.

17:01.754 --> 17:04.457
Well, let's just hope
that he parked Lee's car
outside one of them.

17:04.491 --> 17:05.458
Always the optimist.

17:05.492 --> 17:06.493
Look it, if we split up,

17:06.526 --> 17:08.095
we're going
to cover more ground.

17:08.128 --> 17:09.696
All right, tell Fin
to meet us down there.

17:09.729 --> 17:12.199
I'll call the Jersey
State Troopers.

17:12.232 --> 17:13.500
Nothing so far.

17:13.533 --> 17:15.135
I have three motels
left on my list.

17:15.168 --> 17:16.503
I'll check in with you later.

17:16.536 --> 17:18.538
Okay.

17:21.408 --> 17:23.210
Haven't seen him.

17:23.243 --> 17:25.545
It might help if
you actually look.

17:26.579 --> 17:28.348
Wait a minute.

17:28.381 --> 17:30.350
That's room 612.

17:30.383 --> 17:32.119
He makes an ugly woman.

17:32.152 --> 17:33.353
A better wig might help.

17:33.386 --> 17:34.721
Which rooms are occupied?

17:34.754 --> 17:36.456
Kind of slow right now.

17:36.489 --> 17:38.658
Just 614, upstairs
in back, and, uh,

17:38.691 --> 17:40.660
115, first floor.

17:40.693 --> 17:41.828
Call for backup.

17:41.861 --> 17:43.530
Evacuate everybody
on the first floor.

17:43.563 --> 17:45.498
I'm going
to take the upstairs.

18:15.495 --> 18:17.530
Are you alone?

18:24.604 --> 18:25.605
Where's Baxter?

18:25.638 --> 18:26.806
I don't know.

18:26.839 --> 18:29.409
He left a couple
minutes ago.

18:31.844 --> 18:33.513
Let's go.

18:42.189 --> 18:43.723
Stay close to the wall.

18:43.756 --> 18:45.758
Stay back.

18:46.759 --> 18:48.361
Andy, it's me.

18:48.395 --> 18:50.163
I got Lee, no Baxter.

18:50.197 --> 18:51.498
Anvil Motel.

18:53.233 --> 18:55.235
You stay there.

19:01.574 --> 19:03.443
Give me the gun,

19:03.476 --> 19:06.513
or you're both dead.

19:10.817 --> 19:12.285
What happened?
Olivia went in.

19:12.319 --> 19:14.187
She didn't wait
for backup.
Any shots fired?

19:14.221 --> 19:16.189
No, but we have to assume
that Baxter disarmed her.

19:16.223 --> 19:17.324
I shouldn't have
left her alone.

19:17.357 --> 19:18.758
She's smart.
She'll figure a way out.

19:18.791 --> 19:20.560
Yeah, I just don't want
her playing the hero.

19:20.593 --> 19:22.729
You talk to her?
I tried. The bastard
wouldn't let me.

19:22.762 --> 19:24.797
Threatened to
kill them both.
What room are they in?

19:24.831 --> 19:26.433
612. Command Center's
in 109. You Palmer?

19:26.466 --> 19:28.468
Yeah. Jersey SWAT.
I've got the silent drill

19:28.501 --> 19:29.736
and the fiber optics
you asked for.

19:29.769 --> 19:31.371
The rest of my team
is on the way.

19:31.404 --> 19:32.772
All right, we're not waiting.
Come on.

19:32.805 --> 19:35.508
FIN:
SWAT's pulling up.

19:35.542 --> 19:38.711
ECKERSON:
All right, I'm
through the wall.

19:38.745 --> 19:40.947
Hand me that scope.

19:42.014 --> 19:44.384
Looks like
you've done this before.

19:44.417 --> 19:48.255
It's not my first
hostage situation.

19:49.422 --> 19:52.925
( helicopter hovering )

19:52.959 --> 19:54.561
MAN:
Fiber Optic Team, go!

19:57.930 --> 19:59.499
Suspect's in room 612,

19:59.532 --> 20:01.401
and I drilled
through the baseboard of 611.

20:01.434 --> 20:03.403
Camera is set up.

20:03.436 --> 20:05.438
MAN 1 ( over radio ):
Snipers get into position.

20:05.472 --> 20:07.307
MAN 2 ( over radio ):
...to Command.

20:07.340 --> 20:09.409
We're entering the adjacent
motel room now.

20:09.442 --> 20:10.943
MAN 1:
Roger that. Clear.

20:10.977 --> 20:12.612
ECKERSON:
Where are we
with the fiber optics?

20:12.645 --> 20:13.613
Almost there.

20:13.646 --> 20:16.516
I need a picture up, now.
One more minute.

20:16.549 --> 20:18.518
Room phone's disconnected,
plus we got a generator

20:18.551 --> 20:19.519
in case we got
to cut the juice.

20:19.552 --> 20:21.388
McKenzie's on
the roof across
the parking lot.

20:21.421 --> 20:23.490
Venetian blinds are limiting
the view into the room.

20:23.523 --> 20:24.491
What's his count?

20:24.524 --> 20:25.725
Three subjects,
all moving.

20:25.758 --> 20:27.727
Right. Let me know
when anybody has a shot.

20:27.760 --> 20:28.728
Cragen's on his way.

20:28.761 --> 20:30.029
Munch is
at Carin's apartment,

20:30.062 --> 20:31.398
in case
you need her cooperation.

20:31.431 --> 20:32.365
Picture's up.

20:32.399 --> 20:35.302
MAN 1:
SWAT Team, we have eyes.
Stand by.

20:35.335 --> 20:37.437
What are you doing?
Watch this.

20:37.470 --> 20:40.340
MAN 2 ( over radio ):
Ten-four, SWAT Leader.
Standing by.

20:40.373 --> 20:42.742
( phone ringing,
Benson sighs )

20:42.775 --> 20:43.910
Hand it over.

20:43.943 --> 20:44.911
Okay.

20:44.944 --> 20:46.446
Come on.

20:47.947 --> 20:49.949
Who's calling?

20:49.982 --> 20:51.451
That's my partner.

20:51.484 --> 20:53.420
They want to negotiate.

20:53.453 --> 20:56.823
I don't want to talk.

20:56.856 --> 20:58.491
BENSON:
You got no chance here.

20:58.525 --> 20:59.526
Because the marshals are going

20:59.559 --> 21:00.993
to put sharpshooters
all around us.

21:01.027 --> 21:02.362
That's all right.

21:02.395 --> 21:03.330
They got to know

21:03.363 --> 21:05.565
that I got a pretty
marshal as a hostage.

21:05.598 --> 21:07.334
They're not
going to fire on
one of their own.

21:07.367 --> 21:09.369
I'm not a marshal.
Well, who the hell
are you then?

21:09.402 --> 21:11.371
I'm a detective, NYPD.
My name is Olivia Benson.

21:11.404 --> 21:12.439
I'm going to show you my shield.

21:12.472 --> 21:13.940
No. You're going
to keep your hands

21:13.973 --> 21:15.808
where I can see them,
right on your knees.

21:15.842 --> 21:17.610
Okay, we can work
this out, you and me.

21:17.644 --> 21:18.711
I got it all
worked out.

21:18.745 --> 21:20.613
Everything I need is right here.

21:20.647 --> 21:22.415
I got my old, my buddy Lee.

21:22.449 --> 21:23.716
I got a nine millimeter.

21:23.750 --> 21:24.884
Don't touch me.

21:24.917 --> 21:26.586
Why? What are you
going to do, huh?

21:26.619 --> 21:28.321
What, are you
gonna tell Mommy?

21:28.355 --> 21:29.556
I bet she freaked

21:29.589 --> 21:31.724
when she heard
I escaped from prison, huh?

21:31.758 --> 21:33.860
Mike, hurting Lee is not going
to help you.

21:33.893 --> 21:35.595
Lady, I don't
want to hurt him.

21:35.628 --> 21:37.430
I just want him to talk to me.

21:37.464 --> 21:39.031
Whatever you need,
I can help you,

21:39.065 --> 21:41.568
but you're going to have
to trust me, okay?

21:41.601 --> 21:43.570
Trust you?

21:43.603 --> 21:44.704
This isn't about you.

21:44.737 --> 21:45.872
It's about me now,

21:45.905 --> 21:47.874
because I'm here.

21:47.907 --> 21:51.411
And I am your best chance
of walking out of here alive.

21:51.444 --> 21:52.612
I don't need you.

21:52.645 --> 21:53.780
Go on, get the hell out.

21:53.813 --> 21:55.748
What?
Leave!

21:55.782 --> 21:57.517
I'm not going to stop you.

22:02.622 --> 22:03.590
Go, Olivia.

22:03.623 --> 22:06.926
What the hell are you waiting
for?! Get out!

22:06.959 --> 22:09.562
Go on!

22:12.432 --> 22:15.067
I'm not going anywhere.

22:15.101 --> 22:17.504
What, are you crazy, huh?

22:17.537 --> 22:18.605
Get out of there.

22:19.872 --> 22:21.408
I promised your mother

22:21.441 --> 22:23.643
that nothing was going
to happen to you.

22:23.676 --> 22:25.077
I'm going to do my best

22:25.111 --> 22:26.078
to keep my word.

22:26.112 --> 22:28.047
You keep my mother out of this.

22:28.080 --> 22:29.582
You don't even know her.

22:29.616 --> 22:31.083
She had everything
to do with this

22:31.117 --> 22:32.685
because you pulled her into it,

22:32.719 --> 22:33.953
and she's as involved
as you are now.

22:33.986 --> 22:35.054
Shut up.

22:35.087 --> 22:36.523
I want you to shut up now.

22:36.556 --> 22:38.558
She paid for your escape, Mike.

22:38.591 --> 22:39.559
She gave you

22:39.592 --> 22:40.660
Lee's address.

22:40.693 --> 22:42.495
She's in really deep.

22:42.529 --> 22:46.399
If anybody goes near
my mother, I'll kill you.

22:46.433 --> 22:48.835
I'll kill both of you.
You understand me?

22:48.868 --> 22:51.070
All right, McKenzie,
green light-- shoot the bastard.

22:53.506 --> 22:56.776
I don't have a shot.
I can't isolate the target.

22:56.809 --> 22:58.411
Take a shot through the wall?

22:58.445 --> 22:59.579
Too risky;
it might ricochet.

22:59.612 --> 23:01.180
CRAGEN:
What's going on?
Captain.

23:01.213 --> 23:03.550
You can't shoot
with her in there.
This is my call.

23:03.583 --> 23:05.151
And that is
my detective in there.

23:05.184 --> 23:07.153
You need to negotiate.

23:07.186 --> 23:08.555
He's not going to talk to us.

23:08.588 --> 23:10.590
He said if we contact him,
he'll kill them.

23:10.623 --> 23:12.659
BENSON:
Listen to me.
You're not a murderer.

23:12.692 --> 23:13.926
Don't become one.

23:13.960 --> 23:16.696
And you need to end this
peacefully, Mike.

23:16.729 --> 23:19.198
Don't give your mother
any more grief,

23:19.231 --> 23:21.033
She loves you.
She wants to see you again.

23:21.067 --> 23:22.735
So why don't you put
the gun down,

23:22.769 --> 23:25.104
and you and me are going to walk
out that door right now, okay?

23:25.137 --> 23:27.173
My mother is the only one
who believed in me.

23:27.206 --> 23:29.676
She knows that I didn't do it.
She knows that he lied.

23:29.709 --> 23:31.811
Why does she keep saying
that she's sorry

23:31.844 --> 23:33.145
for what you did to me?

23:33.179 --> 23:34.814
What did you say,
you little prick, huh?

23:34.847 --> 23:35.815
Hey...
Sit down.

23:35.848 --> 23:38.651
She knows what
you did to me.

23:38.685 --> 23:41.588
Everyone knows
what you did.

23:41.621 --> 23:44.724
What have you told my...
my son?

23:44.757 --> 23:45.625
What have you
told Danny?

23:45.658 --> 23:46.959
Danny doesn't know anything.

23:46.993 --> 23:48.661
He only found out that
you were alive

23:48.695 --> 23:51.197
when you called
the house today.

23:51.230 --> 23:54.601
I've been waiting for years
to see my boy.

23:54.634 --> 23:57.637
And the whole time
you've just been

23:57.670 --> 24:00.006
filling his head
with lies.

24:00.039 --> 24:01.741
Command, I have a shot.

24:01.774 --> 24:03.643
Repeat, I have a shot.

24:03.676 --> 24:04.744
McKenzie's got a shot.

24:04.777 --> 24:05.745
Don't do it.

24:05.778 --> 24:06.746
This isn't up to you.

24:06.779 --> 24:07.747
They're talking.

24:07.780 --> 24:10.116
Give her a chance.

24:10.149 --> 24:12.251
BENSON:
Your mother sees your son.

24:12.284 --> 24:14.621
Your mother sees Danny
all the time; they're close.

24:14.654 --> 24:17.089
McKenzie, hold your position;
wait for my signal.

24:17.123 --> 24:18.625
MCKENZIE:
Roger that.

24:18.658 --> 24:20.660
She would have told me
what he looks like.

24:20.693 --> 24:21.661
She couldn't.

24:21.694 --> 24:23.563
Carin made her promise not to.

24:23.596 --> 24:25.765
It was the only way she would
let your mother visit him.

24:25.798 --> 24:27.700
No, you're just screwing
with my head.

24:27.734 --> 24:28.901
You're making things up.

24:28.935 --> 24:31.638
My mother would have told me
if she had ever seen Danny.

24:31.671 --> 24:33.873
LEE:
She knew that
you were guilty.

24:33.906 --> 24:35.808
That's why she
didn't tell you.

24:35.842 --> 24:39.646
She didn't want you messing
with my little brother

24:39.679 --> 24:41.748
like you messed with me.

24:41.781 --> 24:44.116
No, my mother never would
have helped me escape

24:44.150 --> 24:45.852
if she thought I was guilty.

24:45.885 --> 24:47.920
Your mother wants to see
you before she dies.

24:49.989 --> 24:52.725
And I can take you
to her,

24:52.759 --> 24:55.662
but you've got to let him go.

24:55.695 --> 24:57.163
And then what,
your pals shoot me down?

24:57.196 --> 24:58.598
No, because you
know why?

24:58.631 --> 25:00.633
I'm going to walk out
of here with you,

25:00.667 --> 25:02.669
and you can use me
as a shield, Mike...

25:02.702 --> 25:04.637
Son of a bitch,
what the hell is she doing?

25:04.671 --> 25:06.005
She's going to get
herself killed.

25:06.038 --> 25:07.273
She's connecting with him.

25:07.306 --> 25:09.542
See, I just don't trust cops.

25:09.576 --> 25:11.243
You people believe what
you want to believe,

25:11.277 --> 25:12.511
not the truth.

25:15.247 --> 25:18.250
So what if somebody
made a mistake?

25:18.284 --> 25:20.753
Lee was young.
He was traumatized.

25:20.787 --> 25:21.788
I've seen it
happen before.

25:21.821 --> 25:22.889
I didn't,
I didn't make a mistake.

25:22.922 --> 25:24.056
Yeah, but suppose
somebody did

25:24.090 --> 25:26.092
make a mistake.

25:26.125 --> 25:29.596
That makes you a victim.

25:29.629 --> 25:31.097
I don't need your help.

25:31.130 --> 25:32.131
I need his.

25:32.164 --> 25:34.066
LEE:
You sick bastard.

25:34.100 --> 25:36.769
Lee... Lee...
You ruined my life.

25:36.803 --> 25:37.904
I loved you like a son.

25:37.937 --> 25:40.873
Your father walked out,
and I was always there for you.

25:40.907 --> 25:41.608
Always.

25:41.641 --> 25:43.275
LEE:
You wanted
one thing,

25:43.309 --> 25:45.211
and you used my
mother to get it.

25:50.116 --> 25:51.784
I never hurt you.

25:51.818 --> 25:54.286
Ever.

25:54.320 --> 25:57.624
I want to talk to Carin.

25:57.657 --> 25:59.759
LEE:
You leave
my mother alone.

25:59.792 --> 26:01.994
She hates your lousy guts.

26:02.028 --> 26:03.796
The phone is dead.

26:03.830 --> 26:05.698
They cut it off.

26:05.732 --> 26:07.600
They cut it off...

26:07.634 --> 26:09.636
but they can connect you.

26:09.669 --> 26:10.703
Munch there yet?

26:10.737 --> 26:12.271
He's waiting for instructions.

26:12.304 --> 26:13.840
Tell him to prep Carin.

26:13.873 --> 26:14.741
Get her ready.

26:14.774 --> 26:16.776
Try to stay calm.

26:16.809 --> 26:19.045
( sobbing ):
He's got Lee in there.

26:19.078 --> 26:20.279
How can I be calm?

26:20.312 --> 26:21.981
We can get him out safe,
but we need your help.

26:22.014 --> 26:22.815
CARIN:
I can't.

26:22.849 --> 26:24.684
MUNCH:
You got to gather yourself,

26:24.717 --> 26:26.052
pull yourself together
and do this.

26:26.085 --> 26:27.687
Okay. Okay.

26:27.720 --> 26:29.288
All right.

26:29.321 --> 26:32.124
Just gather yourself
and do it.

26:34.426 --> 26:36.128
Eckerson.

26:36.162 --> 26:37.129
All set.

26:37.163 --> 26:38.230
Stand by.

26:42.835 --> 26:44.136
( phone ringing )

26:44.170 --> 26:46.005
Answer it.

26:46.038 --> 26:47.339
Benson.

26:50.009 --> 26:51.944
It's Carin.

26:53.980 --> 26:55.815
Hello.

26:55.848 --> 26:57.083
Hello, Mike.

26:57.116 --> 27:00.887
They said you wanted
to talk to me.

27:00.920 --> 27:02.722
Is Lee all right?

27:02.755 --> 27:06.358
I don't want to hurt him, Carin.

27:06.392 --> 27:08.027
What do you want?

27:09.962 --> 27:11.998
To talk to Danny.

27:14.366 --> 27:17.403
You know, when I first went
to prison,

27:17.436 --> 27:20.339
I used to try to call
all the time.

27:20.372 --> 27:23.676
I wanted to have
a picture of my son.

27:23.710 --> 27:28.014
Carin, I didn't
even know his
name until today.

27:30.282 --> 27:32.318
Danny, say hello to your father.

27:34.854 --> 27:36.422
Hello?

27:38.490 --> 27:40.426
Hi.

27:40.459 --> 27:42.829
Danny...

27:42.862 --> 27:44.864
I'm your dad.

27:44.897 --> 27:47.834
Everybody said you were dead.

27:47.867 --> 27:49.936
I hope someday that

27:49.969 --> 27:53.740
maybe I can explain
everything to you.

27:53.773 --> 27:57.076
Listen, whatever happens,

27:57.109 --> 28:01.714
I think it's important
for you to know that...

28:01.748 --> 28:02.849
I love you,

28:02.882 --> 28:06.719
and I've loved you ever since
the day you were born.

28:06.753 --> 28:08.354
That's enough, Mike.

28:08.387 --> 28:11.023
Now, I let you talk to Danny.

28:11.057 --> 28:12.058
Let Lee go.

28:12.091 --> 28:13.025
No, no, no.

28:13.059 --> 28:15.995
Not until you listen to me.
You never would.

28:16.028 --> 28:17.229
Please.

28:21.067 --> 28:25.004
Carin, that night,
I came home from work

28:25.037 --> 28:27.506
and the police were waiting
at our front door...

28:27.539 --> 28:30.376
I mean, you never even
gave me a chance to
tell my side of the story.

28:30.409 --> 28:32.078
You lying sack of...

28:32.111 --> 28:35.081
Lee, you've got
to let him finish.

28:35.114 --> 28:36.348
Shut your mouth.

28:36.382 --> 28:40.019
Carin, you've got to believe me,
I swear, I never touched him.

28:40.052 --> 28:42.889
He's getting too emotional.
We got to cut the phone off

28:42.922 --> 28:45.057
before Baxter loses it
and does something crazy.

28:45.091 --> 28:45.892
Hold on, hold on.

28:45.925 --> 28:49.428
I never went
into Lee's room ever.

28:49.461 --> 28:52.965
You snuck in my room
and touched me every night.

28:52.999 --> 28:55.868
You're going to stop lying...
right now.

28:55.902 --> 28:58.437
You're going to tell
her it wasn't me.

28:58.470 --> 28:59.371
Tell her!

28:59.405 --> 29:01.540
Yes, you did; you raped me,

29:01.573 --> 29:04.243
and I hope
that you burn in hell!

29:04.276 --> 29:06.112
Give me the gun.

29:06.145 --> 29:07.914
I ought to kill you right now.

29:07.947 --> 29:08.981
Green light.
Take your shot! Go!

29:11.150 --> 29:12.451
BENSON:
Let's end it right now.

29:12.484 --> 29:13.920
Shoot the bastard.

29:13.953 --> 29:15.187
I'm going
to take the gun, Mike.

29:16.388 --> 29:18.057
( gunshot )

29:18.090 --> 29:19.859
( grunts )

29:33.339 --> 29:33.873
The bullet grazed his aorta.

29:34.874 --> 29:36.308
We had to put in a graft.

29:36.342 --> 29:38.344
What are his chances?
Touch and go.

29:38.377 --> 29:39.912
We'll call if his
condition changes.

29:39.946 --> 29:41.948
Thanks.

29:44.450 --> 29:47.119
So, you heading back
to Virginia?

29:47.153 --> 29:49.021
Yeah, my job's done.

29:49.055 --> 29:50.122
Yeah.

29:51.223 --> 29:52.892
ECKERSON:
Here comes trouble.

29:59.932 --> 30:01.033
Look what you've done.

30:01.067 --> 30:05.137
And you promised you wouldn't
let them hurt my son.

30:05.171 --> 30:08.975
All these years, I've
had to lie to everyone--

30:09.008 --> 30:10.910
tell Lee I believe him,

30:10.943 --> 30:13.045
tell Danny his
father's dead,

30:13.079 --> 30:17.216
tell my son
I've never seen his child.

30:17.249 --> 30:21.120
Michael has suffered
for ten years.

30:25.057 --> 30:27.860
Did he tell you anything
about what really happened?

30:27.894 --> 30:31.030
He said that
he didn't rape Lee.

30:31.063 --> 30:32.899
What did Lee say?

30:32.932 --> 30:35.334
He stuck to his story.

30:35.367 --> 30:38.537
Well, he's lying.
Can't you tell that?

30:38.570 --> 30:40.639
He put a gun
to her head.

30:40.672 --> 30:43.242
You're lucky
he's still alive.

30:43.275 --> 30:45.644
You know that Michael
is innocent.

30:45.677 --> 30:49.381
Now, I told you where he was
so you could help him...

30:49.415 --> 30:50.983
not execute him.

30:56.588 --> 30:57.423
Why are you still here?

30:57.456 --> 30:58.991
I just need to finish
a few things.

30:59.025 --> 31:03.062
What you need is
a few days off.

31:03.095 --> 31:04.630
And a visit to
the department shrink?

31:04.663 --> 31:07.033
That's up to you.
I think you should go home.

31:07.066 --> 31:08.968
I can't.

31:09.001 --> 31:10.069
Something's not right.

31:10.102 --> 31:11.470
What's bothering you?

31:11.503 --> 31:12.939
A couple of things.

31:12.972 --> 31:14.306
Baxter could have fled
to safety,

31:14.340 --> 31:16.108
and instead he risked
coming here.

31:16.142 --> 31:16.909
He didn't want revenge.

31:16.943 --> 31:18.677
All he wanted was
to talk to Lee.

31:18.710 --> 31:19.678
Don't you mean
terrorize Lee?

31:19.711 --> 31:22.581
Put a gun to his head
and force him to recant?

31:22.614 --> 31:24.150
I was in that
room, Captain,

31:24.183 --> 31:26.118
and by the end, I didn't know
what to believe.

31:26.152 --> 31:27.219
Then believe
the DNA, Olivia.

31:27.253 --> 31:29.021
It says Baxter's guilty.

31:29.055 --> 31:30.990
Actually, that's just
what I was looking at.

31:31.023 --> 31:33.592
Did you know that
the Virginia crime lab

31:33.625 --> 31:36.062
that tested the DNA
in Baxter's case

31:36.095 --> 31:37.396
is under investigation?

31:37.429 --> 31:38.397
Let me see that.

31:38.430 --> 31:41.100
The guy who heads it up,
his name is Paul Wytko.

31:41.133 --> 31:44.036
He was indicted for lying
about his qualifications.

31:44.070 --> 31:45.371
He personally handled
Baxter's case.

31:45.404 --> 31:46.939
Just because
he faked his resume

31:46.973 --> 31:48.307
doesn't mean
he fabricated evidence.

31:48.340 --> 31:50.576
No harm in making sure.

31:52.011 --> 31:53.279
All right, call Warner.

31:53.312 --> 31:55.314
See if she knows anybody
in that lab

31:55.347 --> 31:57.016
who can retest the sample.

31:57.049 --> 31:59.952
But if the DNA doesn't exonerate
Baxter, it's over.

32:04.023 --> 32:06.125
Ten years ago, DNA testing

32:06.158 --> 32:06.959
was in its infancy.

32:06.993 --> 32:09.161
A serologist would
eyeball the results

32:09.195 --> 32:11.130
and determine a match visually.

32:11.163 --> 32:12.431
So there was room
for error?

32:12.464 --> 32:15.134
The DNA should be identified
by a code number

32:15.167 --> 32:16.302
to prevent
biased results.

32:16.335 --> 32:19.538
When Wytko tested Baxter's DNA,
it wasn't a blind sample.

32:19.571 --> 32:21.207
He knew
the facts of the case.

32:21.240 --> 32:24.076
Which means that
he knew that Baxter
was being charged

32:24.110 --> 32:25.577
with sodomizing an
11-year-old boy.

32:25.611 --> 32:27.646
That makes it pretty
hard to be objective.

32:27.679 --> 32:30.016
Lab in Virginia
retested the samples

32:30.049 --> 32:31.517
and e-mailed me the results.

32:31.550 --> 32:33.986
Left is Baxter's,
right is the sample taken

32:34.020 --> 32:35.087
from Lee's bedsheets.

32:35.121 --> 32:37.123
That doesn't
look like a match.

32:37.156 --> 32:38.124
It's not.

32:38.157 --> 32:38.957
Whose DNA is it?

32:38.991 --> 32:41.127
I don't know, but
I compared Lee's DNA

32:41.160 --> 32:42.694
to the sample
from the bedsheets,

32:42.728 --> 32:44.730
just to make sure
they were different.

32:44.763 --> 32:46.098
And what did you get?

32:46.132 --> 32:48.034
Quite a surprise.

32:48.067 --> 32:49.101
They're different,

32:49.135 --> 32:51.237
but they have the same
Y chromosome.

32:51.270 --> 32:55.474
Lee and his rapist
are related.

32:55.507 --> 32:57.143
ECKERSON:
Baxter's not guilty?

32:57.176 --> 32:57.976
Great, I ordered
the shot

32:58.010 --> 33:00.146
that could have killed
an innocent man.

33:00.179 --> 33:01.680
Andy, you didn't
have a choice.

33:01.713 --> 33:04.183
He's an escaped prisoner
holding two hostages.

33:04.216 --> 33:05.217
So who the hell raped Lee?

33:05.251 --> 33:07.553
Somebody related to him
on his father's side.

33:07.586 --> 33:10.022
But the grandfather has
been dead for 30 years

33:10.056 --> 33:12.124
and the dad moved to Europe
when Lee was four.

33:12.158 --> 33:14.760
What about uncles,
they have the same Y chromosome.

33:14.793 --> 33:16.062
There's only one.

33:16.095 --> 33:17.363
He moved to Vegas 12 years ago

33:17.396 --> 33:19.065
and nobody's heard
from him since.

33:19.098 --> 33:20.799
Which leaves us
with cousin Jeremy.

33:20.832 --> 33:21.767
The guy that works with Carin?

33:21.800 --> 33:23.735
I read the file;
he never lived in Virginia.

33:23.769 --> 33:26.172
But according
to Carin's statement
to the Virginia police,

33:26.205 --> 33:27.239
he was visiting them.

33:27.273 --> 33:30.676
He returned to New York
the night before the rape.

33:30.709 --> 33:32.244
The cops didn't
see a reason

33:32.278 --> 33:33.112
to interview Jeremy.

33:33.145 --> 33:36.382
We've got one now.

33:36.415 --> 33:38.750
I was there for two weeks
over spring break,

33:38.784 --> 33:40.352
but I left
before it happened.

33:40.386 --> 33:42.121
Can anyone corroborate that?

33:42.154 --> 33:43.155
What's this all about?

33:43.189 --> 33:45.091
Just tying up
loose ends.

33:45.124 --> 33:46.525
You caught Baxter.

33:46.558 --> 33:48.560
What do you want from me?

33:48.594 --> 33:49.561
Your DNA.

33:49.595 --> 33:50.662
Why?

33:50.696 --> 33:53.299
It would really help us out,
for exclusionary purposes.

33:53.332 --> 33:54.766
To exclude what?

33:54.800 --> 33:56.568
A couple of details

33:56.602 --> 33:58.504
that the Virginia police
may have overlooked.

33:58.537 --> 33:59.638
You've got
to be kidding.

33:59.671 --> 34:02.174
That pervert breaks out of jail,
holds my cousin hostage,

34:02.208 --> 34:04.610
and now you want to put my
family through more hell?

34:04.643 --> 34:06.112
I'm guessing that's a no?

34:06.145 --> 34:07.346
Damn right.
You have the man

34:07.379 --> 34:08.580
that raped Lee.

34:08.614 --> 34:11.217
ECKERSON:
Yeah, standing right
in front of me.

34:11.250 --> 34:12.418
You're wrong.

34:12.451 --> 34:13.752
No, I'm not.

34:13.785 --> 34:15.721
Let's see you prove it.

34:15.754 --> 34:17.523
You son of a bitch.
Andy...

34:17.556 --> 34:18.857
Andy!

34:18.890 --> 34:21.493
You've been lying
for ten years.

34:21.527 --> 34:22.394
Andy, let him go.

34:22.428 --> 34:24.330
An innocent man almost
died because of you.

34:24.363 --> 34:26.732
Ten years of his life,
destroyed.
Andy, that's enough!

34:26.765 --> 34:27.766
That's enough!

34:27.799 --> 34:29.535
Stop it!
Let him go!

34:32.271 --> 34:33.605
Get the hell out!

34:38.844 --> 34:41.180
Can you get us a warrant
to test Jeremy's blood?

34:41.213 --> 34:42.248
Are you sure
you want me to?

34:42.281 --> 34:43.282
Why wouldn't I?

34:43.315 --> 34:44.350
Because I'd bet
my paycheck

34:44.383 --> 34:46.652
that Jeremy will counter
with a brutality complaint.

34:46.685 --> 34:48.187
What the hell
did you tell her?

34:48.220 --> 34:49.188
The truth.

34:49.221 --> 34:51.357
The truth is, he's a liar
and he's a rapist.

34:51.390 --> 34:52.558
I'm trying
to protect you

34:52.591 --> 34:54.460
and the integrity
of this investigation.

34:54.493 --> 34:56.528
I suggest you find
a way to prove your case

34:56.562 --> 34:58.264
without a warrant
for Jeremy's DNA.

35:07.873 --> 35:08.840
Thanks.

35:08.874 --> 35:10.842
You okay?

35:10.876 --> 35:12.878
Just a bruise on my forehead,

35:12.911 --> 35:14.880
otherwise he didn't hurt me.

35:14.913 --> 35:17.649
What about
ten years ago?

35:17.683 --> 35:21.353
What is that supposed to mean?

35:21.387 --> 35:22.721
You don't
believe Baxter?

35:22.754 --> 35:25.657
I believe DNA.

35:25.691 --> 35:26.658
Good.

35:26.692 --> 35:28.294
Good, it was a match.

35:28.327 --> 35:30.196
That's right, Lee,
it was a perfect match,

35:30.229 --> 35:31.530
but not to Baxter.

35:31.563 --> 35:34.566
The lab made a mistake.

35:34.600 --> 35:36.435
We retested it.

35:36.468 --> 35:39.805
We know that it was Jeremy.

35:40.839 --> 35:42.374
You're crazy.

35:42.408 --> 35:44.543
Jeremy didn't rape me.

35:44.576 --> 35:45.611
Lee, stop.

35:45.644 --> 35:46.912
I understand

35:46.945 --> 35:48.314
that you're scared,

35:48.347 --> 35:49.681
and I understand that
you're embarrassed,

35:49.715 --> 35:50.916
but the lies have to end now.

35:50.949 --> 35:53.619
I told you,
Jeremy didn't rape me.

35:53.652 --> 35:55.221
Then it was consensual.

35:55.254 --> 35:56.021
No.

35:56.054 --> 35:58.424
Lee, I don't think
you're hearing me.

35:58.457 --> 35:59.958
Think of your little brother.

35:59.991 --> 36:01.693
He's never even seen his father.

36:01.727 --> 36:03.895
And your mother, believing all
these years

36:03.929 --> 36:05.297
that the man she loved

36:05.331 --> 36:06.398
was a rapist.

36:06.432 --> 36:07.733
Please, just stop.

36:07.766 --> 36:09.501
The lies have to stop, Lee.

36:11.002 --> 36:12.538
Now, tell me

36:12.571 --> 36:15.707
what really happened.

36:18.544 --> 36:19.845
Be a man

36:19.878 --> 36:21.547
and make things right.

36:25.384 --> 36:28.654
We shared a room.

36:28.687 --> 36:33.525
Jeremy got into my bed
and he touched me.

36:35.861 --> 36:37.396
Things got out of hand.

36:37.429 --> 36:39.331
I didn't know
what to do.

36:39.365 --> 36:41.933
When my mom saw
the sheets, I panicked.

36:41.967 --> 36:43.269
I didn't think

36:43.302 --> 36:45.304
she would call the police.

36:45.337 --> 36:47.873
I was scared.
What was I supposed to do?

36:47.906 --> 36:50.676
What was I supposed to do?
I was scared.

36:56.948 --> 37:00.686
Please, don't tell my mom.
Please...

37:00.719 --> 37:03.355
Please.

37:04.390 --> 37:06.392
( door opening )

37:10.396 --> 37:12.598
What have you done?

37:16.602 --> 37:17.836
I'm sorry.

37:17.869 --> 37:21.006
I'm sorry. It just came out

37:21.039 --> 37:22.774
and then it was too late
to take back.

37:22.808 --> 37:23.909
I'm sorry.

37:23.942 --> 37:27.346
Mike loved you like his own son.

37:27.379 --> 37:30.849
You stole ten years of his life.

37:30.882 --> 37:33.452
No, no,
he was not right for you.

37:33.485 --> 37:36.021
We were doing great,
just you and me.

37:36.054 --> 37:38.357
You needed a father.

37:38.390 --> 37:39.558
I needed you,

37:39.591 --> 37:42.761
and Baxter was taking you
away from me.

37:42.794 --> 37:45.431
He got you pregnant.

37:45.464 --> 37:47.599
You were going to go
have your own family,

37:47.633 --> 37:49.501
and I was going to be left out.

37:49.535 --> 37:52.604
I never meant to hurt you.

37:52.638 --> 37:55.374
Mom, this is
not your fault.

37:56.675 --> 38:01.447
Yes, it is.

38:01.480 --> 38:04.983
I raised a son with... no heart.

38:11.990 --> 38:13.959
This isn't right.
I didn't do anything.

38:13.992 --> 38:15.527
Sure you did.

38:15.561 --> 38:17.463
You obstructed justice,
hindered prosecution.

38:17.496 --> 38:19.064
Plus you're a lying
piece of crap,

38:19.097 --> 38:21.400
but we ain't gonna
charge you with that one.

38:21.433 --> 38:22.668
I'm not putting up
with this.

38:22.701 --> 38:25.337
Hey, my lawyers are going
to sue you

38:25.371 --> 38:26.405
for brutality.

38:26.438 --> 38:27.439
Be my guest,

38:27.473 --> 38:28.507
tough guy.

38:28.540 --> 38:30.842
You're kind of low on
credibility there, Jeremy.

38:30.876 --> 38:33.579
Lee told us everything.

38:37.683 --> 38:39.017
What did you tell them?

38:39.050 --> 38:42.421
What you did to me
ten years ago.

38:45.457 --> 38:47.526
You're making it up.

38:47.559 --> 38:49.395
You're confused.

38:49.428 --> 38:53.532
You told me to keep it a secret,
so I made myself forget.

38:53.565 --> 38:56.001
Do you know
that I said it was Baxter

38:56.034 --> 38:59.438
so many times that I almost
believed it myself.

38:59.471 --> 39:01.440
But it was you.

39:07.713 --> 39:10.416
We were just kids, okay?

39:10.449 --> 39:12.584
We were just
messing around.

39:12.618 --> 39:15.587
With ten years
of someone else's life.

39:15.621 --> 39:17.856
Come on, we're
going to booking.

39:22.528 --> 39:24.563
I spoke to the Virginia DA
about Sheila.

39:24.596 --> 39:27.566
They're willing to settle
for a nolo contendere plea

39:27.599 --> 39:29.468
for her role
in the prison break.

39:29.501 --> 39:30.469
BENSON:
Probation.

39:30.502 --> 39:31.703
What about Baxter?

39:31.737 --> 39:32.671
If he recovers,

39:32.704 --> 39:34.873
Virginia will vacate
the original sentence.

39:34.906 --> 39:35.974
Because he's innocent,

39:36.007 --> 39:38.477
they'll give him time served
for the prison break.

39:38.510 --> 39:40.646
Well, either way,
your work is done.

39:42.481 --> 39:44.850
I could stay a couple more days.

39:46.752 --> 39:50.489
Andy, I don't think
that's a good idea.

39:55.093 --> 39:58.396
How about one drink
before I leave?

40:02.568 --> 40:04.836
It's not going
to work between us.

40:04.870 --> 40:06.672
Why not?

40:06.705 --> 40:10.876
Because I have enough
insanity in my life.

40:10.909 --> 40:13.779
I need stability.

40:24.656 --> 40:25.957
See you around, Liv.

40:39.605 --> 40:41.507
Detective Benson.

40:41.540 --> 40:43.475
How you doing?

40:43.509 --> 40:44.810
Not too bad.

40:44.843 --> 40:47.012
Considering I got

40:47.045 --> 40:48.947
a hole in my chest.

40:51.282 --> 40:55.854
Kind of wish the bullet
had hit my heart.

40:57.889 --> 41:01.226
I can't go back to prison.

41:01.259 --> 41:02.694
You're not.

41:02.728 --> 41:05.697
We know that
you didn't rape Lee.

41:05.731 --> 41:07.799
It was his cousin Jeremy.

41:09.901 --> 41:11.637
You can prove it?

41:11.670 --> 41:12.838
I already have.

41:12.871 --> 41:15.774
You're going to be
a free man, Mike.

41:17.676 --> 41:19.711
Your mother is on
her way over here.

41:19.745 --> 41:20.979
So is Carin,

41:21.012 --> 41:23.715
who is bringing Danny.

41:23.749 --> 41:28.119
She wants him to get
to know his father.
