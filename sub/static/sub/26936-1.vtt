00:01.710 --> 00:03.711
NARRATOR:	 Tonight on
The Curse of Oak Island...

00:03.711 --> 00:06.089
a special two-hour premiere.

00:06.089 --> 00:07.799
MARTY: This is gonna be
 the biggest year ever.

00:07.799 --> 00:09.092
There's no more guesswork.

00:09.092 --> 00:11.385
MARTY: We have discovered
 new technology.

00:11.385 --> 00:13.596
Here it comes.

00:13.596 --> 00:16.265
JEREMY: Right near the circle,
 there's a possible shaft.

00:16.265 --> 00:17.934
We know there's a tunnel here.

00:17.934 --> 00:19.853
Let's get to work.

00:19.853 --> 00:22.312
CRAIG: They're gonna take
 a sample of the lead cross.

00:22.312 --> 00:24.940
This has some story to tell us.

00:24.940 --> 00:26.067
-(high-pitched whining)
-Look!

00:26.067 --> 00:27.861
It's another bobby-dazzler.

00:27.861 --> 00:29.027
We did it again.

00:31.114 --> 00:34.701
NARRATOR: There is an island
 in the North Atlantic

00:34.701 --> 00:38.621
where people have been looking
for an incredible treasure

00:38.621 --> 00:41.750
for more than 200 years.

00:41.750 --> 00:43.585
So far, they have found

00:43.585 --> 00:47.630
a stone slab with strange
symbols carved into it,

00:47.630 --> 00:50.341
mysterious fragments
of human bone

00:50.341 --> 00:54.179
and a lead cross
whose origin may stretch back

00:54.179 --> 00:56.722
to the days
of the Knights Templar.

00:56.722 --> 00:59.600
To date, six men have died

00:59.600 --> 01:01.226
trying to solve the mystery.

01:01.226 --> 01:04.272
And, according to legend,

01:04.272 --> 01:07.358
one more will have to die

01:07.358 --> 01:11.236
before the treasure
can be found.

It is the beginning
of another new year

01:40.724 --> 01:43.436
on Oak Island...

01:47.816 --> 01:50.401
MARTY:
 Okay. Big brother, here we go.

01:50.401 --> 01:53.530
-This year the dream comes true.
-Oh, yeah.

01:53.530 --> 01:55.823
NARRATOR: ...and for brothers
 Rick and Marty Lagina,

01:55.823 --> 01:58.826
it is also shaping up
to be the most productive

01:58.826 --> 02:01.829
and successful season yet
in their quest

02:01.829 --> 02:05.415
to solve
a 223-year-old mystery.

02:05.415 --> 02:08.169
How you feeling about this year?

02:08.169 --> 02:10.586
Boy, we certainly have a box
full of puzzle pieces.

02:10.586 --> 02:13.508
-Yeah.
-And it's about time
we stepped up to the plate

02:13.508 --> 02:15.050
and start putting
the puzzle pieces together.

02:15.050 --> 02:18.429
-Yep.
-Okay, so, where's your belief

02:18.429 --> 02:20.764
that something happened on Oak
Island, scale of one to ten?

02:20.764 --> 02:25.186
I'd say I am 70% convinced
that something

02:25.186 --> 02:28.230
-very, very out of the ordinary
-Out of the ordinary.

02:28.230 --> 02:29.566
occurred on Oak Island.

02:29.566 --> 02:30.775
That's a long way
from where you were.

02:30.775 --> 02:32.569
Long way from where
I started, yes.

02:32.569 --> 02:35.070
-Long way.
-Well, here's where
I'm at, Rick, I mean,

02:35.070 --> 02:36.865
this thing has been way harder
than I thought.

02:36.865 --> 02:39.783
-I know.
-But it's exciting,

02:39.783 --> 02:42.829
-the things we laid out
on that table last year.
-I know.

02:42.829 --> 02:46.081
-And that drives me
and that motivates me.
-I agree.

02:46.081 --> 02:49.085
We're looking at a display
of the year's finds.

02:49.085 --> 02:52.296
NARRATOR: Last year saw
 the Laginas and their partners

02:52.296 --> 02:55.258
make some of their most
astonishing discoveries

02:55.258 --> 02:59.219
to date, including
two 17th-century coins,

02:59.219 --> 03:02.098
a brooch containing
a hand-carved,

03:02.098 --> 03:04.141
semiprecious gemstone,

03:04.141 --> 03:09.021
and a mysterious lead cross,
which appears eerily similar

03:09.021 --> 03:13.276
to one carved in the wall of a
Templar prison in Domme, France

03:13.276 --> 03:17.280
and may date as far back
as the 14th century.

03:17.280 --> 03:21.491
I think the lead cross is
the single most important item

03:21.491 --> 03:25.829
found on Oak Island that
we are absolutely sure of.

03:25.829 --> 03:28.290
I think there's a lot more
to be learned about that cross.

03:28.290 --> 03:30.919
MARTY:
 Rick, I tell you.

03:30.919 --> 03:33.420
Every year is, "This is the
year, this is the year."

03:33.420 --> 03:36.007
Well, you know what,
it's made me feisty.

03:36.007 --> 03:37.800
And I say we throw
every damn resource we have

03:37.800 --> 03:40.344
-at it this year.
-Yep. Yep.

03:40.344 --> 03:43.680
So, I'm feeling like this year
is, it's go big or go home.

03:43.680 --> 03:45.766
-(laughs)
-Here we go!

03:45.766 --> 03:47.393
Once more into the breach!

03:49.937 --> 03:53.441
I have come a long ways
towards being convinced

03:53.441 --> 03:56.401
that something extraordinary
happened on this island.

03:56.401 --> 03:58.070
We're finding some things

03:58.070 --> 04:00.114
that are really,
really hard to explain,

04:00.114 --> 04:01.824
so I'd like to see us
do something

04:01.824 --> 04:04.076
ten times as big
as we did last year.

04:04.076 --> 04:06.329
I'm just gratified
to hear him say that.

04:06.329 --> 04:08.789
(chuckles) So, I'm good.

04:08.789 --> 04:11.709
MARTY:
 Here we are.

04:11.709 --> 04:13.336
Oh, wow, that's very nice.

04:13.336 --> 04:16.463
NARRATOR: Because of the
 increasing number of visitors

04:16.463 --> 04:18.632
to the island
during the summer months,

04:18.632 --> 04:22.302
Rick, Marty and their
Oak Island partners

04:22.302 --> 04:25.348
have built a second,
even more private, war room

04:25.348 --> 04:27.141
on another area of the island.

04:27.141 --> 04:28.559
Nice.

04:28.559 --> 04:31.062
-You like that?
-Yeah.

04:31.062 --> 04:34.564
-There they are.
-(overlapping chatter)

04:34.564 --> 04:36.858
The fellowship of the dig. Yes!

04:36.858 --> 04:38.528
Good to see you guys,
good to see you guys.

04:38.528 --> 04:41.281
NARRATOR: But even though
 the building is new,

04:41.281 --> 04:44.408
the inside remains
comfortably familiar.

04:44.408 --> 04:46.869
Charles. David.

04:46.869 --> 04:48.663
-Marty!
-How goes treasure hunting,
buddy?

04:48.663 --> 04:50.581
-(laughs) Good.
-Hey, Craig, Jack.

04:50.581 --> 04:54.002
There's no question that
this is a treasure hunt,

04:54.002 --> 04:56.004
but it's not just
looking for treasure.

04:56.004 --> 04:57.379
-There's the man.
-Hi, Marty.

04:57.379 --> 04:59.798
Daniel. Good to see you, bud.

04:59.798 --> 05:01.675
-You're looking younger
every year.
-(laughter)

05:01.675 --> 05:04.012
RICK: It's also for the shared
 experience that we have,

05:04.012 --> 05:05.596
the Oak Island family.

05:05.596 --> 05:07.389
-This is the year?
-MARTY: Oh, stop it.

05:07.389 --> 05:09.600
(laughter)

05:09.600 --> 05:11.019
RICK:
I know that we're all committed

05:11.019 --> 05:13.228
to pushing the envelope
this year

05:13.228 --> 05:14.564
in a variety of ways

05:14.564 --> 05:16.649
and, you know, hopefully,
it'll-it'll bear fruit.

05:16.649 --> 05:17.899
Yes.

05:17.899 --> 05:20.028
Well, look,
the mission here today

05:20.028 --> 05:21.612
is to talk about what
we're going to do

05:21.612 --> 05:23.197
and try and get organized.

05:23.197 --> 05:26.324
I think we all have our ideas
of what we do this year,

05:26.324 --> 05:27.367
but I'd like to turn it over
to Rick here

05:27.367 --> 05:29.995
to talk about where we go.

05:29.995 --> 05:31.581
Rick, why don't you lay out
what that means.

05:31.581 --> 05:33.249
Well, I'll lay out my ideas,

05:33.249 --> 05:36.043
but I think I speak
for all of us to this extent:

05:36.043 --> 05:37.795
it's still the big three, right?

05:37.795 --> 05:39.379
-Yeah.
-Yep.

05:39.379 --> 05:41.215
And it's the Money Pit...

05:41.215 --> 05:42.466
-Yep.
-Yep.

05:42.466 --> 05:44.052
-Yeah.
-RICK: ...the swamp...

05:44.052 --> 05:46.387
-Yeah.
-...and then the third
big thing, of course,

05:46.387 --> 05:48.473
Smith's Cove is still a target.

05:48.473 --> 05:51.225
-Absolutely. Right.
-Yeah.

05:51.225 --> 05:52.935
The cross was found
in, uh, in Smith's Cove.

05:52.935 --> 05:55.730
-Yeah.
-RICK: You know, what artifacts
remain there?

05:55.730 --> 05:58.691
What is the U-shaped structure
that Dan found long ago?

05:58.691 --> 06:00.442
DOUG: And you never
got a chance to expose

06:00.442 --> 06:03.362
the whole structure, did you?

06:03.362 --> 06:06.074
I exposed enough of it to say,
to tell what it was

06:06.074 --> 06:08.033
and how it was constructed.

06:08.033 --> 06:12.913
NARRATOR: In 1970, Oak Island
 resident and treasure hunter

06:12.913 --> 06:17.668
Dan Blankenship built a massive
cofferdam around Smith's Cove.

06:17.668 --> 06:21.379
He was hoping to locate
and possibly shut off

06:21.379 --> 06:24.216
a network of booby-trapped
flood tunnels

06:24.216 --> 06:27.302
that are believed to have
been constructed centuries ago

06:27.302 --> 06:30.473
and which were designed
to undermine searcher efforts

06:30.473 --> 06:32.641
to dig in the infamous
Money Pit.

06:32.641 --> 06:36.269
But what Dan found instead
was astonishing:

06:36.269 --> 06:39.524
a massive, U-shaped,
wooden structure

06:39.524 --> 06:42.485
buried some six feet
below the surface

06:42.485 --> 06:45.571
and which featured
a number of notched posts

06:45.571 --> 06:48.908
on which were carved
a series of Roman numerals.

06:48.908 --> 06:53.788
Unfortunately, Dan was forced
to abandon his investigation

06:53.788 --> 06:58.292
when a violent storm
destroyed the dam.

06:58.292 --> 07:01.295
But I would like to get a...

07:01.295 --> 07:03.130
You want to see it?

07:03.130 --> 07:04.507
I want to see it;
I want to stand on it;

07:04.507 --> 07:07.134
I want to expose
the entire structure,

07:07.134 --> 07:09.637
and once and for all,
figure out,

07:09.637 --> 07:12.889
does it have any relevance
to the original work?

07:12.889 --> 07:14.475
CRAIG: You know,
to really do a good job,

07:14.475 --> 07:16.310
I think we're going
to have to go

07:16.310 --> 07:18.478
with a major type of cofferdam.

07:18.478 --> 07:22.024
And so, we've been talking with
a couple different companies,

07:22.024 --> 07:23.651
with different ideas.

07:23.651 --> 07:25.360
Yeah, well, the cofferdam
is a pretty exciting idea.

07:25.360 --> 07:26.487
You're looking forward to that?

07:26.487 --> 07:28.156
Oh, yeah, it has
a lot of potential.

07:28.156 --> 07:29.322
How big are we talking?

07:29.322 --> 07:30.449
-Big.
-Big.

07:30.449 --> 07:32.742
Even bigger
than Dan's cofferdam?

07:32.742 --> 07:34.661
Yes, that's what we are
potentially looking at.

07:36.872 --> 07:40.334
NARRATOR: In an effort
to fully excavate Smith's Cove,

07:40.334 --> 07:42.879
the Oak Island team
is planning to build

07:42.879 --> 07:45.173
what will be
the largest cofferdam

07:45.173 --> 07:47.341
ever constructed on the island.

07:47.341 --> 07:50.677
This massive
water- and weatherproof dam

07:50.677 --> 07:53.346
will allow the team
to not only uncover

07:53.346 --> 07:55.391
any historically
important artifacts

07:55.391 --> 07:57.393
and the U-shaped structure,

07:57.393 --> 08:01.021
but also the possible remains
of the flood tunnels,

08:01.021 --> 08:04.442
flood tunnels that
could lead them directly

08:04.442 --> 08:06.860
to the fabled
Oak Island Money Pit,

08:06.860 --> 08:10.197
a centuries-old treasure vault
rumored to contain everything

08:10.197 --> 08:12.824
from vast hordes
of pirate gold

08:12.824 --> 08:16.120
to the lost folios
of William Shakespeare

08:16.120 --> 08:18.456
and priceless
religious artifacts

08:18.456 --> 08:21.167
taken from the Holy Land
by the Knights Templar

08:21.167 --> 08:23.336
hundreds of years ago.

08:23.336 --> 08:25.295
Uh, what else?

08:25.295 --> 08:27.839
What else are we talking about?

08:27.839 --> 08:30.050
RICK: So many questions
still remain to be answered

08:30.050 --> 08:31.134
-in the Money Pit.
-Yeah.

08:31.134 --> 08:32.427
-Yeah.
-JACK: Yeah.

08:32.427 --> 08:34.554
RICK:
Because of the finds last year

08:34.554 --> 08:37.767
of the parchment,
the bookbinding leather,

08:37.767 --> 08:40.644
the interest in H-8, what
happened to the earthen plug?

08:40.644 --> 08:43.730
MARTY:
Solid wood coming up?

08:43.730 --> 08:45.149
NARRATOR: Last year,
 when the Oak Island team

08:45.149 --> 08:49.028
attempted to excavate
the borehole known as H-8

08:49.028 --> 08:51.572
located in the Money Pit
area...

08:51.572 --> 08:53.658
I'm hoping we're on the corner
of the Chappell Shaft.

08:53.658 --> 08:55.826
NARRATOR: ...they found
 what they believed

08:55.826 --> 08:58.120
to be the legendary
Chappell Vault,

08:58.120 --> 09:01.289
a seven-foot-tall
wooden structure

09:01.289 --> 09:04.251
first discovered by William
Chappell and Frederick Blair

09:04.251 --> 09:09.340
in 1897 and which was believed
to contain ancient documents

09:09.340 --> 09:11.967
and objects made of solid gold.

09:11.967 --> 09:14.220
Something was
in front of the can

09:14.220 --> 09:15.888
and we were pushing it
for a while.

09:15.888 --> 09:18.682
NARRATOR: But when the team
 attempted to reach the vault

09:18.682 --> 09:21.519
with a 60-inch wide
drilling caisson,

09:21.519 --> 09:23.812
instead of penetrating it,
they believe

09:23.812 --> 09:26.106
it simply was pushed
further down

09:26.106 --> 09:29.317
to a depth of some 170 feet

09:29.317 --> 09:32.488
and into what seemed
to be a mud-filled void.

09:32.488 --> 09:34.782
-It's still in there, then.
-Exactly.

09:34.782 --> 09:37.118
NARRATOR: But it was
 while examining the spoils

09:37.118 --> 09:38.952
taken from this same hole

09:38.952 --> 09:40.745
that the team made another
astonishing discovery...

09:40.745 --> 09:43.374
JACK:
What is this?

09:43.374 --> 09:46.751
NARRATOR: ...human bones,
 later identified

09:46.751 --> 09:49.754
as belonging
to two separate individuals:

09:49.754 --> 09:52.883
one from Europe and another
from the Middle East

09:52.883 --> 09:55.344
and both scientifically dated

09:55.344 --> 09:58.556
to be approximately
400 years old.

09:58.556 --> 10:00.850
Well, it just underscores,

10:00.850 --> 10:03.394
-we can't, we can't quit
on H-8, not yet.
-Yeah.

10:03.394 --> 10:05.395
-MARTY: I don't think
we're done there.
-No.

10:05.395 --> 10:07.273
RICK: There is some information
that can be gleaned

10:07.273 --> 10:09.899
and one of the ways,
I'm hopeful, at least,

10:09.899 --> 10:12.320
is that the application
of the seismic

10:12.320 --> 10:14.322
is really going to be a defining
moment for that area.

10:14.322 --> 10:16.323
-Yes.
-Yes.

10:16.323 --> 10:19.243
NARRATOR: Commonly used
 in the energy industry,

10:19.243 --> 10:22.830
seismic scanning is a process
by which a number

10:22.830 --> 10:25.499
of strategically-placed
dynamite charges

10:25.499 --> 10:30.754
are detonated in order
to produce powerful shockwaves.

10:30.754 --> 10:35.009
These shockwaves, in turn,
generate a highly accurate map

10:35.009 --> 10:38.011
of what voids or obstacles
may lie in an area

10:38.011 --> 10:41.307
as much as six miles
below the surface.

10:41.307 --> 10:44.769
RICK: And if this really does
work, it will be the first time

10:44.769 --> 10:46.937
in the two and a quarter
centuries of search

10:46.937 --> 10:50.691
that we can actually look
underground with definition.

10:50.691 --> 10:52.692
If we can look underground
in the Money Pit,

10:52.692 --> 10:54.070
it's a game changer.

10:54.070 --> 10:58.032
A company has
contacted me about that,

10:58.032 --> 11:00.618
-so I'm researching it more.
-Okay, good.

11:00.618 --> 11:02.244
-Th-That's really interesting.
-MARTY: Mm-hmm.

11:02.244 --> 11:03.578
RICK: There's one subject
that kind of got lost

11:03.578 --> 11:05.538
in this discussion
and that is

11:05.538 --> 11:07.666
the rhodolite garnet
that you found last year.

11:07.666 --> 11:08.875
Yeah.

11:08.875 --> 11:10.668
Everyone believes
it was significant.

11:10.668 --> 11:11.754
-Yeah.
-Mm-hmm.

11:11.754 --> 11:13.839
GARY:
Look at this, Rick.

11:13.839 --> 11:17.259
NARRATOR: Last year, while
 metal detecting on Lot 8

11:17.259 --> 11:18.802
on the western portion
of the island...

11:18.802 --> 11:20.596
We just found a jewel.

11:20.596 --> 11:23.557
NARRATOR: ...Rick and Gary
 discovered a brooch

11:23.557 --> 11:27.352
containing a rhodolite garnet,
a semiprecious stone

11:27.352 --> 11:30.980
that may date back earlier
than the 16th century.

11:30.980 --> 11:32.899
GARY:
That is a bobby-dazzler.

11:32.899 --> 11:35.403
MARTY: Gary's discovery
 of the gemstone

11:35.403 --> 11:38.405
was not in any particularly
important spot;

11:38.405 --> 11:40.408
it was just on one of the lots.

11:40.408 --> 11:42.701
So, it's not a great leap
of logic for us

11:42.701 --> 11:44.662
to say we-we would like him

11:44.662 --> 11:46.663
to, effectively,
do the entire island.

11:46.663 --> 11:48.456
Who knows what he might find?

11:48.456 --> 11:52.419
And, to that end,
I think we should clear

11:52.419 --> 11:55.630
lots one through eight
and lots 21 and 22,

11:55.630 --> 11:57.298
which you've never
been able to access.

11:57.298 --> 11:58.759
Yeah, it's just
so thick in there.

11:58.759 --> 12:01.595
You can't swing
a metal detector.

12:01.595 --> 12:02.596
Yeah, we'll get some
heavy equipment in there

12:02.596 --> 12:03.931
and we'll clear those lots.

12:03.931 --> 12:05.474
-You can swing
that metal detector.
-Okay.

12:05.474 --> 12:06.850
RICK: And then, who knows
how many brooches

12:06.850 --> 12:09.437
and/or other things you'll find.

12:09.437 --> 12:13.149
I'm telling you now, guys,
we're gonna need a bigger table.

12:13.149 --> 12:15.109
(laughter)

12:15.109 --> 12:18.571
-You ain't seen nothing.
-You ain't seen nothing yet.

12:19.947 --> 12:21.407
MARTY:
So, gentlemen,

12:21.407 --> 12:23.325
coming into this room,
seeing this assembly

12:23.325 --> 12:24.994
of brilliant minds,

12:24.994 --> 12:26.912
I am nothing but rejuvenated.

12:26.912 --> 12:29.038
We can do this! Can we not?

12:29.038 --> 12:30.791
-Yup.
-Are you ready to get after it?

12:30.791 --> 12:32.418
-Absolutely.
-OTHERS: Yup.

12:32.418 --> 12:34.294
-Okay.
-Let's get out of here.

12:41.802 --> 12:44.388
♪ ♪

12:50.477 --> 12:52.812
NARRATOR: It is a day
 of great anticipation

12:52.812 --> 12:55.566
for Rick, Marty,
and their partners.

12:55.566 --> 12:57.067
Today, they will begin

12:57.067 --> 12:58.860
the process of mapping
the Money Pit area

12:58.860 --> 13:01.864
by means of seismic testing.

13:01.864 --> 13:04.533
MARTY: Well, Craig,
are you excited about this?

13:04.533 --> 13:06.201
It's a long time coming, right?

13:06.201 --> 13:08.203
Yeah. Excited and nervous.

13:08.203 --> 13:10.498
-Are you?
-CRAIG: Sure.

13:10.498 --> 13:13.292
Mainly that the searchers
did so much damage near surface

13:13.292 --> 13:15.168
that we just can't
get good data.

13:15.168 --> 13:18.004
But it's exciting, I mean, if it
does work, we get to see...

13:18.004 --> 13:20.508
-See what's in the ground.
-See what's in the ground,

13:20.508 --> 13:22.467
which your dad's been dreaming
about forever, huh, David?

13:22.467 --> 13:23.844
Yup.

13:23.844 --> 13:25.678
NARRATOR:
 Marty, Rick, their partner

13:25.678 --> 13:28.515
Craig Tester
and Dave Blankenship

13:28.515 --> 13:30.017
have arranged to meet
with representatives

13:30.017 --> 13:31.684
from Eagle Canada,

13:31.684 --> 13:33.895
a geophysical
exploration company.

13:33.895 --> 13:35.523
They will conduct a test

13:35.523 --> 13:37.899
in order to determine
if the application

13:37.899 --> 13:39.902
of seismic scanning technology

13:39.902 --> 13:42.403
will allow them to see
what lies hidden

13:42.403 --> 13:44.948
beneath the surface
of Oak Island.

13:44.948 --> 13:46.908
So, that's where
we're gonna park?

13:46.908 --> 13:48.451
-Yeah.
-Yup.

13:48.451 --> 13:51.205
So, Alex, this is
a novel application, right,

13:51.205 --> 13:52.539
-'cause it's so shallow?
-Yep.

13:52.539 --> 13:54.207
Have you done
some of this before?

13:54.207 --> 13:56.043
-Yeah. Two weeks ago.
-Oh, okay.

13:56.043 --> 13:58.711
And we did the exact same 2-D
line that we're gonna do here,

13:58.711 --> 14:03.049
and, um, we were having good
image at about ten feet down.

14:03.049 --> 14:04.217
-No kidding?
-Yeah.

14:04.217 --> 14:07.554
NARRATOR:
 Because of sonic interference

14:07.554 --> 14:10.765
from environmental noises
generated at ground level,

14:10.765 --> 14:14.311
seismic testing was only
considered reliable

14:14.311 --> 14:16.897
in the mapping
of very deep formations,

14:16.897 --> 14:19.899
often miles below
the Earth's surface,

14:19.899 --> 14:23.278
but thanks
to recent advancements,

14:23.278 --> 14:25.072
seismic testing
of more shallow areas--

14:25.072 --> 14:27.073
like the Money Pit--

14:27.073 --> 14:31.662
have yielded impressive
and highly accurate results.

14:31.662 --> 14:34.038
Well, what we want to do
is start off

14:34.038 --> 14:35.749
with the-the test line.

14:35.749 --> 14:38.918
Right up in through here,
that's the test line.

14:38.918 --> 14:40.962
We know there's a tunnel
you're gonna cross here.

14:40.962 --> 14:42.130
The Halifax tunnel.

14:42.130 --> 14:43.591
So that's gonna be
the test, right?

14:43.591 --> 14:44.966
-To see whether... Yeah.
-Absolutely.

14:44.966 --> 14:47.595
NARRATOR:
 Because a full-scale survey

14:47.595 --> 14:50.597
of the Money Pit area
will be very expensive,

14:50.597 --> 14:54.726
the Oak Island team has decided
to conduct a sample test

14:54.726 --> 14:58.772
over an area where they know
an underground anomaly exists,

14:58.772 --> 15:02.900
the searcher shaft known
as the Halifax tunnel.

15:02.900 --> 15:05.946
Dug in 1867

15:05.946 --> 15:08.490
by a team of treasure hunters
working under the name

15:08.490 --> 15:10.993
The Halifax Company,

15:10.993 --> 15:14.830
the Halifax tunnel
was a 110-foot shaft

15:14.830 --> 15:19.418
located approximately 200 feet
south of the Money Pit.

15:19.418 --> 15:22.837
The location was chosen in
hopes it would allow the team

15:22.837 --> 15:25.215
to dig down
to the Money Pit level

15:25.215 --> 15:28.469
and then over to it
in order to avoid the maze

15:28.469 --> 15:32.431
of booby-trapped flood tunnels
that protect the treasure site.

15:32.431 --> 15:34.140
It didn't work.

15:34.140 --> 15:36.225
As they neared
the target depth,

15:36.225 --> 15:39.812
the shaft suddenly began
filling up with seawater,

15:39.812 --> 15:41.815
forcing the Halifax Company

15:41.815 --> 15:44.985
to abandon
their search efforts.

15:44.985 --> 15:49.030
Because the location of the
shaft has been well documented,

15:49.030 --> 15:50.658
having it show up in the test

15:50.658 --> 15:52.493
will encourage the team

15:52.493 --> 15:54.827
to invest an estimated
$1 million

15:54.827 --> 15:59.165
to map the entire
Money Pit area.

15:59.165 --> 16:02.211
Dan Henskee knows
where the Halifax shaft was

16:02.211 --> 16:05.004
and Dan Blankenship knows
roughly the orientation,

16:05.004 --> 16:07.508
so this is literally a test,

16:07.508 --> 16:09.176
and I hope they pass
with flying colors.

16:09.176 --> 16:11.345
Based on our testing,

16:11.345 --> 16:13.554
I think we should be able
to see that, so...

16:13.554 --> 16:15.014
Good. That's fantastic.

16:15.014 --> 16:16.432
-Yup.
-RICK: Just remember,

16:16.432 --> 16:18.394
we do know where it is,
so don't just pick a spot.

16:18.394 --> 16:20.019
(laughter)

16:20.019 --> 16:22.355
All right, I don't know as we
have anything else left to do.

16:22.355 --> 16:23.524
-Awesome.
-Let's go find some treasure.

16:23.524 --> 16:24.899
-For luck.
-Yes, thanks.

16:24.899 --> 16:27.568
Guys, let's get to work.

16:27.568 --> 16:30.279
NARRATOR: In preparation
 for the seismic test,

16:30.279 --> 16:33.366
the team from Eagle Canada
will now drill

16:33.366 --> 16:36.036
a number of
two-foot-deep holes,

16:36.036 --> 16:37.203
spaced three feet apart,

16:37.203 --> 16:39.038
over the designated
search area.

16:39.038 --> 16:41.709
Each hole will then be filled

16:41.709 --> 16:44.211
with a small blasting cap

16:44.211 --> 16:47.630
containing 20 grams of dynamite
that, when detonated,

16:47.630 --> 16:50.884
will set off a sound wave
through the ground.

16:50.884 --> 16:54.221
They will also strategically
place devices

16:54.221 --> 16:58.225
known as geophones, which,
similar to sonar technology,

16:58.225 --> 17:00.394
will measure the sound waves

17:00.394 --> 17:02.479
as they bounce off
layers of rock

17:02.479 --> 17:04.230
or underground structures.

17:04.230 --> 17:06.817
The goal of the seismic,
simply put,

17:06.817 --> 17:10.237
is to image whatever
we can image underground.

17:10.237 --> 17:12.320
In the case
of the Money Pit area,

17:12.320 --> 17:15.576
it would be to find a vault
or some other structure

17:15.576 --> 17:17.617
that we've hitherto missed.

17:17.617 --> 17:20.622
If we can do that,
I think we're well on our way

17:20.622 --> 17:22.833
to defining a hard target
in the Money Pit,

17:22.833 --> 17:24.916
but whatever information
they can provide us

17:24.916 --> 17:27.127
is surely going to be helpful.

17:31.799 --> 17:33.594
EAGLE WORKER:
 Heads up, guys.

17:33.594 --> 17:37.263
NARRATOR: Later that same day,
 as the team from Eagle Canada

17:37.263 --> 17:39.767
continues to prepare
the Money Pit area

17:39.767 --> 17:42.810
for the test line operation,

17:42.810 --> 17:44.771
and while workers begin
clearing away trees and brush

17:44.771 --> 17:48.608
on the unexplored western areas
of the island...

17:48.608 --> 17:51.487
MARTY: Okay, guys, here we go,
 brand new year, huh?

17:51.487 --> 17:53.905
I'm curious to see
how the island survived.

17:53.905 --> 17:56.616
NARRATOR: ...Marty Lagina
 and members of the team

17:56.616 --> 17:58.410
head to Smith's Cove.

17:58.410 --> 18:01.288
CHARLES: We had a series
 of storms over the winter,

18:01.288 --> 18:03.624
so I would imagine that

18:03.624 --> 18:05.875
that beach had took
a pretty bad hit,

18:05.875 --> 18:08.961
which means it's good
for Gary and Laird

18:08.961 --> 18:10.963
because it should
turn up some things.

18:10.963 --> 18:12.382
Yeah, beach erosion.

18:12.382 --> 18:13.634
Yeah.

18:13.634 --> 18:16.553
There's got to be
some more good stuff, there.

18:16.553 --> 18:17.971
NARRATOR:
 They are eager to know

18:17.971 --> 18:19.306
if months of harsh
winter storms...

18:19.306 --> 18:20.848
Let's go.

18:20.848 --> 18:22.476
NARRATOR: ...might have brought
 to the surface

18:22.476 --> 18:26.313
any more important clues
or valuable objects

18:26.313 --> 18:28.481
like the mysterious lead cross

18:28.481 --> 18:30.901
which was discovered here
last year.

18:30.901 --> 18:34.695
GARY: We'll go straight to where
we recovered the cross.

18:34.695 --> 18:37.990
All right, you ready
to make history, guys?

18:37.990 --> 18:40.326
-Yes.
-(metal detector beeping)

18:40.326 --> 18:42.496
Yeah, so what we'll do,
we'll start here

18:42.496 --> 18:44.539
and we'll go towards
the water's edge

18:44.539 --> 18:47.584
and, uh, just keep
going out there.

18:47.584 --> 18:49.211
Rolling up my sleeves
and everything, Gary.

18:49.211 --> 18:53.006
That's good, that means you're
gonna be doing some digging.

18:53.006 --> 18:55.843
-Okay.
-What's that Gary?

18:55.843 --> 18:59.136
Eh, it's too low,
I think that's iron,

18:59.136 --> 19:02.015
but because it's a deep target,
I think we should dig it up,

19:02.015 --> 19:03.432
just to make sure.

19:03.432 --> 19:07.186
So this is the center
where the target is.

19:11.525 --> 19:14.153
MARTY:
Okay, try.

19:14.153 --> 19:16.864
Let me see if it's closer.

19:16.864 --> 19:21.159
-All right, let's see.
-(metal detector beeping)

19:26.205 --> 19:29.292
It's an iron spike.

19:29.292 --> 19:30.919
Oh, yes.

19:30.919 --> 19:34.131
-We have a few of these.
-Yeah.

19:34.131 --> 19:36.717
-Yeah.
-You think it's modern?

19:36.717 --> 19:38.343
Yeah, that's definitely modern.

19:38.343 --> 19:40.052
What do you say, Laird?

19:40.052 --> 19:42.221
Yeah, it looks--
it's got a square shank,

19:42.221 --> 19:44.766
cut-head nail, so...
It's 19th-century,

19:44.766 --> 19:46.852
-but later, the latter part.
-Well, yeah.

19:46.852 --> 19:48.311
Yeah.

19:48.311 --> 19:51.397
Although this is only just
a little insignificant find,

19:51.397 --> 19:56.028
it isn't, because we pounded
this area last year,

19:56.028 --> 19:59.489
and we're finding, already,
which is a good sign.

19:59.489 --> 20:00.990
-Yeah. Keep going.
-Yeah.

20:16.173 --> 20:18.842
-(beeping)
-We're digging this.

20:18.842 --> 20:20.259
-Okay.
-Okay.

20:20.259 --> 20:22.596
Of course.

20:22.596 --> 20:24.431
And, this is a-a clear, two-way,

20:24.431 --> 20:27.683
repeatable signal.

20:29.603 --> 20:31.980
So I think the best thing to do
with the spoils

20:31.980 --> 20:33.230
is put them up high.

20:40.948 --> 20:42.782
Ooh, that looks like it,
Charles.

20:42.782 --> 20:44.867
-What's that right there?
-Looks like Charles got it out.

20:44.867 --> 20:46.827
-Look, right there.
-Here, guys.

20:46.827 --> 20:48.454
-Wow.
-GARY: This is good!

20:51.791 --> 20:54.461
-MARTY: Is that a piece of lead?
-Yeah, a piece of cut lead.

20:54.461 --> 20:55.962
Huh.

20:55.962 --> 20:58.214
They used to put lead
on the side of ships.

20:58.214 --> 21:00.884
-They used to waterproof
with lead.
-Yeah.

21:00.884 --> 21:02.301
Lead was kind of
a ubiquitous thing.

21:02.301 --> 21:03.845
It was almost like duct tape.

21:03.845 --> 21:05.305
That's it, it's just basically

21:05.305 --> 21:07.015
-a lead patch, isn't it?
-Yeah.

21:07.015 --> 21:09.809
GARY: From a Spanish
treasure hunter's perspective,

21:09.809 --> 21:13.230
this is interesting
because this type of stuff

21:13.230 --> 21:16.357
was used below the water line
on Spanish galleons.

21:16.357 --> 21:19.193
NARRATOR:
 Lead from a Spanish galleon

21:19.193 --> 21:22.154
found on the shore
of Smith's Cove?

21:22.154 --> 21:25.784
Could it have come from one
of the many Spanish galleons,

21:25.784 --> 21:27.576
or even pirate ships,

21:27.576 --> 21:29.538
that are known to have
visited Oak Island

21:29.538 --> 21:33.541
in the 17th and 18th centuries?

21:33.541 --> 21:36.002
That's a thin little cut,
isn't it?

21:36.002 --> 21:37.546
-MARTY: Yeah.
-It's a delicate little...

21:37.546 --> 21:40.089
GARY: Think it was done
with shears, by the look of it?

21:40.089 --> 21:43.175
-It has.
-GARY: So this could be
quite old.

21:43.175 --> 21:44.720
MARTY: You know,
we're all talking marine origin,

21:44.720 --> 21:46.262
which is, of course, is likely,

21:46.262 --> 21:47.888
we're standing at the edge
of the ocean,

21:47.888 --> 21:52.184
but we know we have a mysterious
structure under here,

21:52.184 --> 21:54.020
the notorious
U-shaped structure,

21:54.020 --> 21:56.022
-maybe it had some role in that.
-It's possible.

21:56.022 --> 21:58.066
You mean like waterproofing
on the outside kind of thing?

21:58.066 --> 22:00.027
...'cause we don't know
what that thing was yet.

22:00.027 --> 22:03.446
We don't know what it did,
what it was for, who did it.

22:03.446 --> 22:05.198
I'm keenly interested

22:05.198 --> 22:07.659
in the very significant
U-shaped structure

22:07.659 --> 22:09.452
that has never been
analyzed properly

22:09.452 --> 22:11.538
-o even revealed properly.
-Mm-hmm.

22:11.538 --> 22:13.749
The hope is that we can
expose enough of that,

22:13.749 --> 22:17.711
or all of that, where we can
actually get a proper sample.

22:17.711 --> 22:19.421
And, uh, hopefully,
at the end of the day,

22:19.421 --> 22:20.713
we'll have some answers.

22:20.713 --> 22:23.717
First day,
first significant find,

22:23.717 --> 22:25.176
I believe.

22:25.176 --> 22:27.261
I do, too. It's a clue,
and it also shows

22:27.261 --> 22:28.888
that you know
what you're doing, again.

22:28.888 --> 22:31.057
Another question mark, Marty.

22:31.057 --> 22:32.893
Yeah, great, Charles,
that wasn't supposed to happen.

22:32.893 --> 22:34.478
-(laughter)
-Well, unfortunately,

22:34.478 --> 22:35.854
-we're filling in.
-Yeah.

22:35.854 --> 22:38.272
So we're gonna have to keep
to the higher ground.

22:38.272 --> 22:40.483
I think, uh, guys,
we should keep going.

22:40.483 --> 22:41.484
Yeah.

22:46.698 --> 22:48.240
NARRATOR:
 After a successful day

22:48.240 --> 22:50.743
spent metal detecting
at Smith's Cove,

22:50.743 --> 22:54.247
Marty and Rick,
along with other team members,

22:54.247 --> 22:56.415
gather at the Mug
and Anchor Pub

22:56.415 --> 22:58.876
in the nearby tow
of Mahone Bay

22:58.876 --> 23:03.381
to review their latest finds
and plan critical next steps.

23:03.381 --> 23:06.634
RICK:
What do you make of it, Dan?

23:06.634 --> 23:09.721
Well, first thing
is to suggest--

23:09.721 --> 23:11.932
is to estimate the diameter,

23:11.932 --> 23:14.392
so this looks like
it was part of something

23:14.392 --> 23:16.603
-pretty large.
-Yes, it does, yeah.

23:16.603 --> 23:18.563
Where was this...
was found, exactly?

23:18.563 --> 23:20.690
Mm, kind of right around
where the cross was found.

23:20.690 --> 23:22.608
Very near that.

23:22.608 --> 23:26.403
Maybe the same people that
lost the cross lost this, too.

23:26.403 --> 23:28.280
I mean, anything's possible.

23:28.280 --> 23:30.575
But anyway, it's a nice way

23:30.575 --> 23:31.826
to start off the season
with something, you know.

23:31.826 --> 23:33.953
Exactly.

23:33.953 --> 23:36.038
I think we all acknowledge that
Gary's find of the cross--

23:36.038 --> 23:38.959
I like to call it Drayton's
Cross-- was probably...

23:38.959 --> 23:40.292
He likes that, too.

23:40.292 --> 23:43.380
It was probably the most
exciting find.

23:43.380 --> 23:45.089
You know, I mean,
we need answers from that.

23:45.089 --> 23:47.299
So, at the University
of New Brunswick,

23:47.299 --> 23:49.635
they run this test;
it's called laser ablation.

23:49.635 --> 23:50.804
It's nondestructive.

23:50.804 --> 23:52.138
And then we get what's called

23:52.138 --> 23:54.348
lead isotope values
off of that test.

23:54.348 --> 23:58.435
And from that, the hope is
that they can determine--

23:58.435 --> 24:00.480
Give us, at least,
geographic origin.

24:00.480 --> 24:03.066
Wow.

24:03.066 --> 24:05.234
NARRATOR:
 Much like a human fingerprint,

24:05.234 --> 24:07.112
metals, such as lead,

24:07.112 --> 24:10.448
have unique chemical variants
known as "isotopes"

24:10.448 --> 24:14.618
that are specific to geographic
regions on Earth.

24:14.618 --> 24:18.957
By using a process known as
laser ablation testing,

24:18.957 --> 24:22.460
a high-powered laser will cut
microscopic samples

24:22.460 --> 24:24.921
from the surface
of the lead cross.

24:24.921 --> 24:27.173
This will then be analyzed
to determine

24:27.173 --> 24:29.675
the lead's specific
isotope value,

24:29.675 --> 24:33.680
and possibly its geographic
place of origin.

24:33.680 --> 24:38.184
It is Rick Lagina's hope that
if the test is successful,

24:38.184 --> 24:41.188
he and the team will be one
giant step closer

24:41.188 --> 24:45.025
to finding out not only
where the cross came from,

24:45.025 --> 24:46.692
but how old it is.

24:46.692 --> 24:49.403
And perhaps more importantly,

24:49.403 --> 24:52.824
who may have brought it
to Oak Island.

24:52.824 --> 24:56.076
RICK: We have to get it tested.
 There's no question about it.

24:56.076 --> 24:58.663
Mr. Blankenship has always
cautioned us,

24:58.663 --> 25:01.040
don't let your imagination
run away from you.

25:01.040 --> 25:02.834
Stick to the facts.
You know,

25:02.834 --> 25:06.837
be very objective in your
analysis of anything you find.

25:06.837 --> 25:09.883
So, at the end of the day,
somebody needs to go

25:09.883 --> 25:12.551
to UNB to get this test done.

25:12.551 --> 25:16.806
Peter. I-I designate you
to take it there.

25:16.806 --> 25:18.057
-I can do that.
-Okay.

25:18.057 --> 25:19.768
I will bring a couple
other peop...

25:19.768 --> 25:21.228
a couple of guys with us.

25:21.228 --> 25:23.813
Perfect. And I'm sure
we're all aware

25:23.813 --> 25:25.231
of the unaccessible lots.

25:25.231 --> 25:27.901
Lots one, two, three, four,
six, seven and eight

25:27.901 --> 25:30.111
-are practically impassible.
-Mm-hmm.

25:30.111 --> 25:32.072
We've got a company
to come down with a...

25:32.072 --> 25:34.199
what they call a mulcher.

25:34.199 --> 25:35.366
Gary can finally get into
these areas,

25:35.366 --> 25:38.369
which have been inaccessible
all these years.

25:38.369 --> 25:42.249
So... let's hope the lead is
an auspicious start

25:42.249 --> 25:43.708
to a great new season.

25:43.708 --> 25:46.086
We got a ton of stuff to do,

25:46.086 --> 25:49.631
but for right now,
to the new season.

25:49.631 --> 25:52.467
New season. Absolutely.

25:52.467 --> 25:54.094
-Cheers, guys.
 -Salud.

26:00.599 --> 26:01.768
EAGLE WORKER (over radio):
Roger.

26:01.768 --> 26:03.519
NARRATOR:
 The next day,

26:03.519 --> 26:05.771
as the team from Eagle Canada
finishes preparing

26:05.771 --> 26:10.067
the Money Pit area for today's
seismic test line operation...

26:10.067 --> 26:12.112
RICK:
 Let's do this.

26:12.112 --> 26:14.614
NARRATOR: ...Rick Lagina, along
 with metal detection expert

26:14.614 --> 26:18.410
Gary Drayton
and archeologist Laird Niven,

26:18.410 --> 26:21.746
head to Lot 2, on the western
side of the island.

26:21.746 --> 26:25.250
Look, they did
a remarkable job of clearing,

26:25.250 --> 26:26.459
but I think we should...

26:26.459 --> 26:28.420
Keep expanding the search area.

26:28.420 --> 26:30.630
RICK:
You lead the way, you're--

26:30.630 --> 26:33.133
You're the guy with
the lucky metal detector.

26:33.133 --> 26:35.801
NARRATOR: They are searching
 areas of the island

26:35.801 --> 26:38.305
that have remained
virtually unexplored,

26:38.305 --> 26:42.767
in hopes of finding important
artifacts or treasure.

26:42.767 --> 26:44.978
This looks like
a good spot, guys.

26:44.978 --> 26:47.646
(metal detector chimes)

26:47.646 --> 26:51.317
And we know we are
the first people to search this.

26:51.317 --> 26:54.487
Probably ever.

26:54.487 --> 26:57.115
RICK: Well, all I can say
is good luck.

27:04.288 --> 27:07.208
-GARY: Let's do the big boulder.
-LAIRD: Yeah.

27:12.297 --> 27:13.548
Should we pull the moss
off this?

27:13.548 --> 27:15.090
Are we okay to do that?

27:15.090 --> 27:16.675
Yep.

27:16.675 --> 27:19.596
Wow, this has been on here
a long time.

27:23.266 --> 27:24.933
Up at the top.

27:30.606 --> 27:31.816
(metal detector chimes)

27:31.816 --> 27:33.902
GARY:
Oh, was that a signal?

27:33.902 --> 27:37.697
-(chiming)
-And that's non-ferrous.

27:37.697 --> 27:38.865
LAIRD:
Oh, really?

27:38.865 --> 27:41.534
(sustained tone)

27:41.534 --> 27:44.037
It's quite deep as well.

27:44.037 --> 27:46.873
Reading ten inches.
Just there, mate.

27:56.548 --> 27:58.550
(metal detector chiming)

28:02.221 --> 28:05.307
Still reading deeper.

28:05.307 --> 28:07.894
Give it a shot.

28:09.395 --> 28:11.021
Oh, I've got it.

28:11.021 --> 28:13.191
(beeping)

28:15.567 --> 28:17.153
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

28:18.363 --> 28:21.199
Oh, baby.

28:21.199 --> 28:25.244
GARY:
Look at the patina on that.

28:25.244 --> 28:26.496
RICK:
Oh, my goodness.

28:28.664 --> 28:30.250
-Now, that's a coin!
-You tell me what it is.

28:30.250 --> 28:31.584
That's a coin.

28:31.584 --> 28:34.295
-Oh, man.
-Wow, what is that?

28:34.295 --> 28:38.424
GARY:
That's King George III.

28:38.424 --> 28:40.175
I know what this is.

28:40.175 --> 28:43.137
That's a cartwheel two pence.
A tuppenny.

28:43.137 --> 28:47.933
This looks like
it's from 1797.

28:47.933 --> 28:53.272
NARRATOR: In 1797, a shortage of
 small denomination coins

28:53.272 --> 28:56.817
throughout the British Empire
led to the limited production

28:56.817 --> 29:02.740
of some 720,000 copper coins
known as "two-pennies."

29:02.740 --> 29:05.785
Minted with the likeness
of King George III,

29:05.785 --> 29:10.289
the unusual size of the coins,
combined with a wide outer rim,

29:10.289 --> 29:13.460
earned them the nickname,
"cartwheels."

29:13.460 --> 29:17.337
That is freaking crazy.

29:17.337 --> 29:20.174
What do you make
of the lettering?

29:20.174 --> 29:23.928
It should say "Britannia" on it
on one side.

29:23.928 --> 29:25.637
RICK:
Yeah.

29:25.637 --> 29:28.807
GARY: I mean, we got those
King George coppers.

29:28.807 --> 29:32.228
King Charles,
up near the Money Pit.

29:32.228 --> 29:35.815
We've got British presence
on the island.

29:35.815 --> 29:38.776
NARRATOR: Because it is dated
 two years after

29:38.776 --> 29:42.113
the Money Pit's discovery
in 1795,

29:42.113 --> 29:44.490
the presence of a cartwheel
penny on Oak Island

29:44.490 --> 29:47.993
offers possible evidence
of someone who may have

29:47.993 --> 29:50.997
come to the island
searching for treasure.

29:50.997 --> 29:55.000
But if so, what is it they were
hoping to find on Lot 2,

29:55.000 --> 29:58.922
so far from the infamous
treasure site?

29:58.922 --> 30:02.008
It always buoys our spirits
to find a unique item

30:02.008 --> 30:03.843
that may or may not have

30:03.843 --> 30:05.553
a significant impact

30:05.553 --> 30:08.306
on the constantly evolving
story of Oak Island.

30:08.306 --> 30:10.557
It's always nice to have
a small win.

30:10.557 --> 30:12.059
And that's a small win.

30:14.144 --> 30:17.523
Okay, I hate to badger you,
but...

30:17.523 --> 30:19.025
-what else might be in there?
-Yeah. Okay.

30:19.025 --> 30:20.984
Let's have a look,
see if there's anything else.

30:23.320 --> 30:25.198
NARRATOR:
 As Rick, Gary and Laird

30:25.198 --> 30:28.284
continue their search
for artifacts on Lot 2,

30:28.284 --> 30:30.494
back at the Money Pit,

30:30.494 --> 30:33.914
Craig Tester and members
of the Oak Island team

30:33.914 --> 30:38.044
eagerly await the start
of the seismic test line.

30:38.044 --> 30:40.212
We've hooked up,
and then there's a line

30:40.212 --> 30:42.882
that goes 30 meters to the pack
that's charging up right now.

30:42.882 --> 30:44.968
When they charge, you'll hear
the tone come over the radio.

30:44.968 --> 30:46.260
Okay.

30:53.726 --> 30:55.894
NARRATOR:
 The team from Eagle Canada

30:55.894 --> 30:59.773
will now detonate
some 150 small charges.

30:59.773 --> 31:03.027
This will generate a series
of seismic pulses

31:03.027 --> 31:06.780
deep within the underground
test area.

31:10.910 --> 31:12.202
Here we go.

31:17.125 --> 31:18.459
Ooh, that went up.

31:18.459 --> 31:19.586
JACK: I thought this year
 was gonna be

31:19.586 --> 31:21.628
one of our biggest
search years ever...

31:21.628 --> 31:23.756
EAGLE WORKER:
Heads up.

31:23.756 --> 31:26.092
JACK: ...but I didn't understand
 until I got here

31:26.092 --> 31:27.426
how big we were going,

31:27.426 --> 31:29.929
starting off with this seismic.

31:29.929 --> 31:31.681
I like it.
We have good energy so far.

31:31.681 --> 31:34.099
JACK: And after last year,
 the finds that we had

31:34.099 --> 31:35.934
just from the spoils...

31:37.103 --> 31:38.895
...it gave us enough indication

31:38.895 --> 31:41.941
that there is something
down there worth finding.

31:41.941 --> 31:45.068
And if we have a really good
target off the seismic,

31:45.068 --> 31:46.738
it's not a guessing game
anymore.

31:53.327 --> 31:55.329
NARRATOR:
 One day after conducting

31:55.329 --> 31:58.207
the test-line seismic scan
at the Money Pit site...

31:58.207 --> 32:01.461
We'd like to, first of all,
welcome you to the war room.

32:01.461 --> 32:04.881
NARRATOR: ...Rick Lagina,
 along with Craig Tester,

32:04.881 --> 32:07.799
Charles Barkhouse
and Jack Begley,

32:07.799 --> 32:10.303
meet with the team
from Eagle Canada.

32:10.303 --> 32:13.221
They are eager to find out
if the operation was

32:13.221 --> 32:16.308
successful enough to warrant
further testing,

32:16.308 --> 32:19.354
in hopes of finding out
what may have been buried

32:19.354 --> 32:24.192
deep beneath the surface of Oak
Island more than 200 years ago.

32:24.192 --> 32:27.737
-Hey, Jeremy.
-Hello.

32:27.737 --> 32:29.446
NARRATOR: Joining them
 via videoconference

32:29.446 --> 32:32.032
is geophysicist Jeremy Church,

32:32.032 --> 32:34.576
who will interpret
the test line results.

32:34.576 --> 32:37.372
RICK: We're looking forward
to your presentation.

32:37.372 --> 32:40.040
You've got some results that
we very much look forward to,

32:40.040 --> 32:42.335
to coming to
an understanding about.

32:42.335 --> 32:43.586
Yep.

32:43.586 --> 32:46.130
We were super excited,
stressed a little bit.

32:46.130 --> 32:47.589
We wanted to make it work.

32:47.589 --> 32:51.094
I don't think a seismic
like that have been shot

32:51.094 --> 32:54.513
in the world, like,
that tight of a parameter.

32:54.513 --> 32:56.516
I think we're seeing a page
of history here.

32:56.516 --> 32:59.227
You're talking about
ground-breaking science.

32:59.227 --> 33:01.520
-Yeah.
-Great.

33:01.520 --> 33:04.440
So I'll let Jeremy talk
about the results.

33:04.440 --> 33:07.734
Jack's going to bring the data
on the screen here.

33:07.734 --> 33:11.446
NARRATOR: Using the data from
 yesterday's readings,

33:11.446 --> 33:14.701
the Eagle team has generated
a virtual cross-section

33:14.701 --> 33:17.161
of the ground beneath
the test area.

33:17.161 --> 33:19.497
It has allowed them
to differentiate

33:19.497 --> 33:22.250
not only the layers of rock
and earth,

33:22.250 --> 33:24.711
but also whatever
underground structures

33:24.711 --> 33:26.878
are buried within them.

33:26.878 --> 33:29.507
JEREMY: I wish I could be there
to see your faces,

33:29.507 --> 33:30.758
because it's quite
an impressive image

33:30.758 --> 33:32.593
that has been created here.

33:32.593 --> 33:35.971
I have an area circled
in a little yellow circle.

33:35.971 --> 33:38.557
I'm going to refer to that
as a possible shaft.

33:41.227 --> 33:44.980
You'll see that there is
a nice blue reflector

33:44.980 --> 33:47.150
that's broken at that point,

33:47.150 --> 33:50.778
where I believe that shaft
or opening is.

33:52.279 --> 33:57.160
This typically indicates that
you have a massive change

33:57.160 --> 33:58.452
in the material that's there,

33:58.452 --> 34:00.954
and it's a depth between about

34:00.954 --> 34:03.583
90 feet and 120 feet or so.

34:03.583 --> 34:05.500
That's the Halifax tunnel.

34:05.500 --> 34:08.378
-So it would seem.
-Yeah.

34:08.378 --> 34:11.632
NARRATOR:
 For Rick, Marty and the team,

34:11.632 --> 34:16.219
the success of the seismic test
offers a historic breakthrough.

34:16.219 --> 34:17.804
Here's some really good news.

34:17.804 --> 34:21.349
NARRATOR: For the first time
 in the 223-year history

34:21.349 --> 34:23.768
of the Oak Island
treasure hunt,

34:23.768 --> 34:25.980
they will be able to
effectively create

34:25.980 --> 34:28.648
an accurate map
of what structures

34:28.648 --> 34:31.943
or voids exist
deep within the Money Pit.

34:33.862 --> 34:37.074
The opportunity that's being
presented to us by Eagle

34:37.074 --> 34:40.577
is being able to look
underground for the first time

34:40.577 --> 34:43.498
in two and a quarter centuries
of search; that's remarkable.

34:43.498 --> 34:46.125
Because, as you look back,

34:46.125 --> 34:48.168
the people that have come
before us,

34:48.168 --> 34:50.630
they had no idea of the
complexities underground,

34:50.630 --> 34:52.380
and still they labored.

34:52.380 --> 34:54.842
They would have done anything
to look underground,

34:54.842 --> 34:58.387
to find the answers which they
so long fought for,

34:58.387 --> 35:03.226
bled for
and, in some cases, died for.

35:03.226 --> 35:04.851
That's a story
in and of itself,

35:04.851 --> 35:07.480
and it would be invaluable
as any treasure.

35:10.608 --> 35:11.818
This is ground-breaking.

35:11.818 --> 35:13.277
You're gonna do something

35:13.277 --> 35:14.737
that's never been done
on this island.

35:14.737 --> 35:16.614
The people that have
come and gone

35:16.614 --> 35:18.865
invested their lives,
their passions,

35:18.865 --> 35:20.117
their interests in this mystery.

35:20.117 --> 35:21.369
Yeah.

35:21.369 --> 35:23.579
You're now gonna give them

35:23.579 --> 35:26.666
the best Christmas gift
they've ever opened.

35:28.960 --> 35:31.753
You're changing lives here,
and that's pretty remarkable.

35:31.753 --> 35:35.340
Again, we, I get choked up
when I say thank you.

35:40.221 --> 35:42.306
-You should be proud
of yourselves.
-Yeah.

35:42.306 --> 35:44.141
Yeah.

35:44.141 --> 35:47.561
I very much look forward
to the continued "hunt"

35:47.561 --> 35:49.396
for the information
in the Money Pit.

35:49.396 --> 35:51.523
Yeah, it was nice to hit
the mark on this one.

35:51.523 --> 35:53.233
You hit the mark.
You hit the bull's-eye.

35:53.233 --> 35:54.693
(soft laughter)

35:54.693 --> 35:57.153
-No question about it.
-CHARLES: Yeah.

36:10.418 --> 36:12.420
NARRATOR:
 The next day,

36:12.420 --> 36:16.715
the team from Eagle Canada
returns to Oak Island

36:16.715 --> 36:19.010
ready to begin preparations
for the large-scale

36:19.010 --> 36:23.972
seismic scanning survey across
the entire Money Pit area.

36:23.972 --> 36:26.976
Over the next few days,
they will detonate

36:26.976 --> 36:31.313
some 1,300 charges,
which along with some

36:31.313 --> 36:33.481
1,500 geophone receivers,

36:33.481 --> 36:36.693
will allow them to create
a virtual three-dimensional map

36:36.693 --> 36:40.072
of the ground
beneath Oak Island.

36:41.824 --> 36:43.617
Where are you starting?

36:43.617 --> 36:46.286
Uh, right at the edge of the
Money Pit on the west side.

36:46.286 --> 36:49.706
Yeah, we're gonna chew
that Money Pit up pretty good.

36:49.706 --> 36:51.458
-(laughter)
-In a good way.

36:51.458 --> 36:53.043
In-in a good way.

36:53.043 --> 36:54.586
Right now,
it's all about the data.

36:54.586 --> 36:56.255
JARED:
Yeah, exactly.

36:56.255 --> 36:59.382
NARRATOR: Unlike the
 two-dimensional test line,

36:59.382 --> 37:02.802
the dynamite charges
and geophone receivers

37:02.802 --> 37:05.597
have been strategically
positioned in a grid pattern

37:05.597 --> 37:07.641
around past dig sites,

37:07.641 --> 37:12.355
including the C-1
and H-8 shafts.

37:12.355 --> 37:15.023
The goal of the seismic
in the Money Pit area

37:15.023 --> 37:17.275
would be to find a vault

37:17.275 --> 37:19.820
that we may have missed,

37:19.820 --> 37:22.907
to find something that
we haven't even explored yet.

37:22.907 --> 37:24.867
I am realistically optimistic

37:24.867 --> 37:26.827
about the results
of the seismic.

37:26.827 --> 37:30.706
I've seen a lot of seismic over
the last, probably, 40 years.

37:30.706 --> 37:33.458
And they should be able
to delineate anomalies.

37:33.458 --> 37:37.922
This is just one step forward
in that search for the truth.

37:37.922 --> 37:40.882
It would be awesome if we could
get that, uh, the 3-D data

37:40.882 --> 37:42.927
processed right away
to actually see some of it

37:42.927 --> 37:45.054
while we're still out here...

37:45.054 --> 37:47.389
-Mm-hmm.
-...but not likely.

37:47.389 --> 37:49.849
Do you guys want to go up there
and take a look?

37:49.849 --> 37:51.393
Yeah, I-I'd like to go up there.

37:51.393 --> 37:52.769
-Right, Dave?
-Yeah-- yep.

37:52.769 --> 37:54.730
Let's give it a look.

37:54.730 --> 37:57.525
NARRATOR:
As each seismic line is charged

37:57.525 --> 38:01.152
and armed for blasting,
it will be wirelessly detonated

38:01.152 --> 38:03.905
from the inside
of the command center,

38:03.905 --> 38:07.702
located nearby
on the South Shore Road.

38:07.702 --> 38:10.829
Although only 20 grams
of dynamite is being detonated

38:10.829 --> 38:12.414
in each charge,

38:12.414 --> 38:15.751
the team must remain
at least 150 feet clear

38:15.751 --> 38:17.711
of the blast area.

38:19.588 --> 38:21.757
-Hi, guys.
-Charles.

38:21.757 --> 38:25.135
Alex. Boys. How's it going?

38:25.135 --> 38:27.471
Very good.
The guys are doing really well.

38:27.471 --> 38:29.597
RICK:
This is small-scale in terms of

38:29.597 --> 38:31.809
what you normally do, right?

38:31.809 --> 38:33.184
But this is incredibly
labor-intensive.

38:33.184 --> 38:34.603
I mean, I'm-I'm impressed.

38:34.603 --> 38:36.813
Look, all of this work
you've done,

38:36.813 --> 38:38.481
-hats off to you guys.
-CHARLES: Yeah.

38:38.481 --> 38:40.483
RICK:
You really did a heck of a job.

38:40.483 --> 38:42.110
Hopefully, you're gonna
do something

38:42.110 --> 38:44.612
that's never been done
on Oak Island before,

38:44.612 --> 38:46.824
and that's pretty remarkable.

38:46.824 --> 38:48.659
Yeah.

38:48.659 --> 38:50.202
JEFF (over radio):
Ready to go?

38:50.202 --> 38:51.786
Roger.

38:51.786 --> 38:53.706
Here it comes.

39:11.681 --> 39:14.184
We're watching
the detonations go off,

39:14.184 --> 39:16.311
it somewhat reminds you
of the Fourth of July.

39:16.311 --> 39:17.938
Fireworks are going off.

39:17.938 --> 39:19.773
I think we have
high expectations,

39:19.773 --> 39:22.150
all of us, about this year,

39:22.150 --> 39:24.695
the scope of the project,
because it's about

39:24.695 --> 39:27.239
trying to put
the puzzle together.

39:27.239 --> 39:30.117
T-There's only one goal,
there only has been one goal,

39:30.117 --> 39:32.286
and that is to solve
the Oak Island mystery.

39:33.913 --> 39:35.789
There's no more guesswork.

39:35.789 --> 39:38.876
You guys are actually gonna
give us a playbook.

39:38.876 --> 39:40.210
And that's pretty cool.

39:54.766 --> 39:57.478
NARRATOR: As the team
 from Eagle Canada continues

39:57.478 --> 39:59.480
their extensive seismic
scanning operation

39:59.480 --> 40:03.317
of the Money Pit area...

40:03.317 --> 40:05.735
CRAIG:
 We'll see what they can do.

40:05.735 --> 40:08.822
NARRATOR: ...Craig Tester,
 Dave Blankenship

40:08.822 --> 40:11.407
and Peter Fornetti are
traveling more than 300 miles

40:11.407 --> 40:15.829
northwest of Oak Island to the
University of New Brunswick

40:15.829 --> 40:18.164
in the city of Fredericton.

40:18.164 --> 40:21.043
They have come here
to supervise a test

40:21.043 --> 40:22.795
of the lead cross

40:22.795 --> 40:25.213
that was found last year
at Smith's Cove.

40:25.213 --> 40:28.467
Holy schmoly, all right.

40:28.467 --> 40:30.302
-RICK: It's a cross.
-That's a cross.

40:30.302 --> 40:35.306
NARRATOR: If successful,
 the test could shed new light

40:35.306 --> 40:37.976
on its mysterious origin.

40:37.976 --> 40:42.021
Well, guys,
this should be interesting, uh,

40:42.021 --> 40:45.067
it sounds like this laser
ablation might tell us

40:45.067 --> 40:47.110
what area of the world

40:47.110 --> 40:49.320
this lead came from,
and that would be huge.

40:49.320 --> 40:51.322
-Ah, that'd be cool.
-PETER: I'm pretty excited

40:51.322 --> 40:53.199
-to see what the results are.
-Yeah, me, too.

40:53.199 --> 40:56.327
I believe this is our stop.

40:56.327 --> 40:58.371
NARRATOR: The Department
 of Earth Sciences

40:58.371 --> 41:01.416
at the University
of New Brunswick

41:01.416 --> 41:04.085
is one of the leading
geochemical testing facilities

41:04.085 --> 41:07.505
in North America for the study
of historical artifacts.

41:07.505 --> 41:09.425
Chris?

41:09.425 --> 41:11.092
Hey.

41:11.092 --> 41:12.552
NARRATOR:
 The team has arranged to meet

41:12.552 --> 41:13.762
with Dr. Chris McFarlane,

41:13.762 --> 41:16.431
a professor of geochemistry

41:16.431 --> 41:18.099
who specializes in the study

41:18.099 --> 41:21.978
of ancient geologic depositions
and minerals.

41:21.978 --> 41:24.231
Well, we've got something
for you to look at.

41:24.231 --> 41:25.690
Just wondering
if you can tell us a bit

41:25.690 --> 41:28.318
about the-the testing procedures
and whatnot.

41:28.318 --> 41:32.239
Yeah, so, we're gonna do,
uh, laser ablation.

41:32.239 --> 41:34.199
We want to get
a really high precision

41:34.199 --> 41:36.076
and accurate
lead isotope number.

41:36.076 --> 41:38.369
And from that lead,
you can determine

41:38.369 --> 41:40.039
where the lead came from?

41:40.039 --> 41:42.666
As long as we get enough lead
to analyze ratios.

41:42.666 --> 41:44.710
Okay.

41:44.710 --> 41:47.170
NARRATOR:
 Using a series of pulses

41:47.170 --> 41:48.922
from a high-powered laser,

41:48.922 --> 41:51.382
Dr. McFarlane will cut
a sample--

41:51.382 --> 41:53.885
barely the size
of a human hair--

41:53.885 --> 41:55.471
from the surface of the cross

41:55.471 --> 41:58.974
and vaporize it
into an ionized gas.

41:58.974 --> 42:03.144
This gas is then superheated
and funneled into a device

42:03.144 --> 42:05.438
known as a mass spectrometer,

42:05.438 --> 42:09.318
which will determine
the lead's isotope signature.

42:09.318 --> 42:10.902
Well, I have it with me.

42:10.902 --> 42:13.322
Here's the box.

42:13.322 --> 42:16.199
So if we can get it going,
get it into the machine.

42:16.199 --> 42:17.826
-Okay.
-Let's go see it.
-Appreciate it.

42:17.826 --> 42:19.577
CRAIG:
 The laser ablation,

42:19.577 --> 42:21.079
it's kind of like
fingerprinting it,

42:21.079 --> 42:22.706
and once you have a fingerprint,

42:22.706 --> 42:24.123
then you can try to find out

42:24.123 --> 42:26.043
where did
that fingerprint come from?

42:26.043 --> 42:27.628
NARRATOR:
 Assisting Dr. McFarlane

42:27.628 --> 42:31.507
is lab technician
Brandon Boucher.

42:31.507 --> 42:33.259
So let's have a look.

42:33.259 --> 42:37.346
So that is the cross.

42:37.346 --> 42:39.597
Yeah, very nice.

42:39.597 --> 42:42.851
CRAIG: How about the, uh.,
the corrosive material on it?

42:42.851 --> 42:45.019
I mean, does that help
date it or not?

42:45.019 --> 42:47.106
I think for us,
we are gonna avoid it.

42:47.106 --> 42:49.942
We don't want any impurities
that are possibly

42:49.942 --> 42:52.945
going to shift
the ratios at all.

42:52.945 --> 42:54.612
CRAIG:
I mean, what if this was

42:54.612 --> 42:57.115
sitting in the air, for hundreds
and hundreds of years?

42:57.115 --> 42:58.951
Would it get
that same corrosion?

42:58.951 --> 43:01.661
You don't get deposition
on an object that hasn't

43:01.661 --> 43:03.956
been buried for, you know,
quite a while.

43:03.956 --> 43:06.375
-Oh, that's great news.
-Yeah, keep going with this.

43:06.375 --> 43:08.251
-You're doing good.
-This is not something
that was, you know, buried...

43:08.251 --> 43:11.130
it wasn't buried a week ago or a
year ago or even ten years ago.

43:11.130 --> 43:14.842
-Yeah.
-So should we proceed
with mounting this up now?

43:14.842 --> 43:17.469
-As far as I'm concerned.
-Okay.

43:17.469 --> 43:19.012
Because this is
an irregular shape,

43:19.012 --> 43:23.141
we have to use a, uh,
sample holder.

43:23.141 --> 43:24.809
This is called
our universal holder.

43:24.809 --> 43:28.105
All this stuff over here,
these are all standards.

43:28.105 --> 43:31.525
All right? So when we do
isotopic analysis,

43:31.525 --> 43:35.820
we always have to reference
the measurement to a standard.

43:35.820 --> 43:39.907
NARRATOR: To ensure that the
 data collected is accurate,

43:39.907 --> 43:43.619
Dr. McFarlane will also test
known samples of lead ore,

43:43.619 --> 43:46.581
also called "standards."

43:46.581 --> 43:48.541
This will give the mass
spectrometer a baseline

43:48.541 --> 43:51.085
to reference when analyzing
the lead sample

43:51.085 --> 43:53.297
taken from the cross.

43:53.297 --> 43:55.840
CHRIS: So the next step is to
actually put it in the machine.

43:55.840 --> 43:56.884
CRAIG:
Okay.

43:56.884 --> 43:58.844
Not far away. Over here.

43:58.844 --> 44:00.846
(machine chiming)

44:03.724 --> 44:05.184
Now you guys should
come and see this.

44:05.184 --> 44:07.226
-CRAIG: Okay.
-PETER: All right.

44:07.226 --> 44:09.188
This is the coolest part
of the whole day.

44:09.188 --> 44:11.065
So this is where
all the action happens,

44:11.065 --> 44:14.360
so we have to get this guy
inside the cell.

44:14.360 --> 44:16.945
So now this guy
is gonna go in here.

44:16.945 --> 44:22.284
And, as I push it in,
you'll actually see... bonk.

44:22.284 --> 44:24.869
-Oh, yeah.
-So the magnets grabbed it.

44:24.869 --> 44:28.206
So what we need to do is
actually go down to the cross,

44:28.206 --> 44:29.875
and we need to find an area

44:29.875 --> 44:33.461
that has some nice
clean, exposed lead.

44:33.461 --> 44:35.922
And here we can also zoom in.

44:35.922 --> 44:38.717
So what we're gonna do is define

44:38.717 --> 44:42.596
about 20 sample locations
within that area.

44:42.596 --> 44:44.306
And then we'll go
and define the standards

44:44.306 --> 44:45.724
to populate around them.

44:47.643 --> 44:49.478
Okay, so that's our sequence.

44:49.478 --> 44:52.648
So let's start the laser.

44:55.400 --> 44:56.985
That's the laser pulsing.

44:56.985 --> 45:00.197
Each pulse is liberating
material from the surface.

45:00.197 --> 45:04.284
And it's actually--
it's high enough energy

45:04.284 --> 45:06.286
that it's making light.

45:06.286 --> 45:08.579
So as the material's liberated

45:08.579 --> 45:10.666
from the surface
with each pulse,

45:10.666 --> 45:13.668
the next pulse of the laser
is traveling through that

45:13.668 --> 45:16.922
and is actually ionizing it
into its own plasma.

45:16.922 --> 45:18.297
CRAIG:
 Everybody that we've talked to

45:18.297 --> 45:20.800
thinks it's very old, so to me,

45:20.800 --> 45:22.469
it brings up a bunch
of questions that we don't

45:22.469 --> 45:25.431
have answers for right now,
but I'm eager

45:25.431 --> 45:27.974
to see what kind of results
they'll come up with.

45:27.974 --> 45:30.811
Okay, so this is good.
So, ready to go.

45:30.811 --> 45:32.813
This is collecting now,

45:32.813 --> 45:36.275
and we come over here
and we start the sequence.

45:37.943 --> 45:41.362
And now we wait.

45:41.362 --> 45:43.157
Okay.

45:43.157 --> 45:44.699
NARRATOR:
 As Dr. McFarlane continues

45:44.699 --> 45:46.617
to conduct
the laser ablation testing

45:46.617 --> 45:48.327
on the lead cross,

45:48.327 --> 45:53.291
Jack Begley and metal detection
expert Gary Drayton

45:53.291 --> 45:56.043
are continuing their search
for important clues

45:56.043 --> 45:58.880
and possible treasure on Lot 2.

45:58.880 --> 46:01.340
The same area
where the team uncovered

46:01.340 --> 46:05.804
an 18th-century British coin
just two days ago.

46:05.804 --> 46:08.974
JACK: Well, looks like we have
our work cut out for us.

46:08.974 --> 46:10.476
GARY:
Yeah.

46:10.476 --> 46:14.021
This is a little higher up
in elevation,

46:14.021 --> 46:17.858
so there shouldn't be any trash
that's washed in here.

46:17.858 --> 46:20.652
Whatever's here should be good.

46:20.652 --> 46:22.570
JACK:
 Since Lots 1 through 4

46:22.570 --> 46:25.740
really haven't been searched
at all by anyone in the past,

46:25.740 --> 46:29.161
there's a really good chance
that we could find evidence

46:29.161 --> 46:31.579
of people who were here
looking for something

46:31.579 --> 46:33.998
or, possibly,
depositing something.

46:36.210 --> 46:38.670
It's a little bit quiet, Jack.

46:38.670 --> 46:42.090
I'm just gonna keep zigzagging.

46:42.090 --> 46:44.842
I'm hoping we can
pick something up

46:44.842 --> 46:49.347
in these little valleys.

46:49.347 --> 46:52.141
Let's search over
by this boulder, Gary.

46:52.141 --> 46:55.019
GARY: Oh, I would imagine
there's gonna be a depression

46:55.019 --> 46:56.855
at the side of it.

46:56.855 --> 46:58.648
And that's interesting,
you know,

46:58.648 --> 47:03.320
these are interesting features,
these boulders and depressions.

47:03.320 --> 47:07.032
All of these boulders
have got some kind

47:07.032 --> 47:09.284
of depression next to them.

47:09.284 --> 47:13.789
Perhaps there is more underneath
the boulder to discover.

47:13.789 --> 47:16.041
JACK: All right, mate,
I will have a little search

47:16.041 --> 47:19.001
around here, see if there's
anything close to it.

47:19.001 --> 47:21.170
-Yeah, yeah,
I'll-I'll get out of your...
-(beeping)

47:21.170 --> 47:22.422
Wait, really?

47:22.422 --> 47:24.882
-You found something right away?
-Yeah.

47:24.882 --> 47:26.552
(Jack coughs)

47:26.552 --> 47:30.054
GARY: Well, that's a really
nice, sharp signal.

47:30.054 --> 47:33.307
-JACK: What is it? Iron?
-GARY: Yeah, it's reading iron.

47:35.018 --> 47:37.103
Yeah, it's iron.

47:37.103 --> 47:39.981
-(detector beeps loudly)
-Screaming iron.

47:39.981 --> 47:43.443
I don't think it's very deep.
Let me see if I can pinpoint it.

47:43.443 --> 47:44.443
Yeah, go for it.

47:44.443 --> 47:46.989
This could be another

47:46.989 --> 47:49.407
lucky find.

47:51.367 --> 47:52.786
-There it is.
-(machine beeping)

47:52.786 --> 47:55.831
See, that's exactly why
all this moss

47:55.831 --> 47:58.166
needs to be taken off
these boulders.

47:58.166 --> 48:01.003
Yup.

48:03.880 --> 48:05.298
-Wow!
-What?

48:05.298 --> 48:07.425
Would you look at this! Iron!

48:07.425 --> 48:09.177
Oh, and there's a drilled hole!

48:09.177 --> 48:11.512
There's a freaking hole!

48:11.512 --> 48:13.472
What has someone
been doing here?

48:13.472 --> 48:16.184
Definitely, that is man-made.

48:16.184 --> 48:19.021
Wow!

48:19.021 --> 48:22.231
That is crazy.

48:27.945 --> 48:31.574
The heck has someone
been doing here?

48:31.574 --> 48:33.452
NARRATOR:
 While exploring Lot 2

48:33.452 --> 48:35.954
on the western side
of Oak Island,

48:35.954 --> 48:39.791
Jack Begley and metal detection
expert Gary Drayton

48:39.791 --> 48:42.543
have just unearthed
an unusual object:

48:42.543 --> 48:46.797
an iron spike embedded
in a large stone

48:46.797 --> 48:49.300
and with several holes
drilled into it.

48:50.427 --> 48:52.137
Why would someone

48:52.137 --> 48:54.347
drill into this rock

48:54.347 --> 48:56.141
and put metal in there?

48:56.141 --> 48:59.186
Definitely, that is man-made.

48:59.186 --> 49:02.230
Do you think that there were
two, right next to each other?

49:02.230 --> 49:04.148
Well, we don't know
how many is in here.

49:04.148 --> 49:08.402
I mean, look, Jack, you can see
where this has been pounded in.

49:08.402 --> 49:10.822
I mean, this?

49:10.822 --> 49:13.449
It wouldn't surprise me
if this is a ringbolt

49:13.449 --> 49:17.161
you put a chain around or a rope
and you pull things.

49:17.161 --> 49:20.164
It's here for moving
some other stuff.

49:20.164 --> 49:23.835
And what do you haul up?
Treasure.

49:23.835 --> 49:25.711
(chuckles)

49:25.711 --> 49:28.172
NARRATOR:
 Shortly after their discovery

49:28.172 --> 49:31.009
of the Money Pit in 1795,

49:31.009 --> 49:34.346
Daniel McGinnis
and his friend John Smith

49:34.346 --> 49:36.347
discovered a large
iron ringbolt

49:36.347 --> 49:40.184
embedded in a boulder
on the beach at Smith's Cove.

49:40.184 --> 49:41.853
They believed that this rock

49:41.853 --> 49:44.271
was part of
an ancient pulley system

49:44.271 --> 49:47.358
where heavy cargo was moved
on or off sailing ships

49:47.358 --> 49:49.443
by means of a heavy chain

49:49.443 --> 49:52.030
threaded through the eye
of a ringbolt.

49:52.030 --> 49:55.867
Could this stone found on Lot 2

49:55.867 --> 49:58.577
have once been used
for such a purpose?

49:58.577 --> 50:03.708
And, if so, what exactly
was being transported and why?

50:03.708 --> 50:07.378
GARY: And look, if you look
on here, there's, like, a tab

50:07.378 --> 50:09.380
that comes around,

50:09.380 --> 50:13.885
and-and it's obvious that these
two holes are connected.

50:13.885 --> 50:16.346
I think that we need to,
at this point, just call Rick,

50:16.346 --> 50:17.597
get him out here.

50:17.597 --> 50:19.599
This is important enough
for him to see.

50:19.599 --> 50:22.143
Yeah, 'cause I've got
a sneaky suspicion

50:22.143 --> 50:24.646
that piece of iron
is under there.

50:24.646 --> 50:27.065
And who knows what else
is under there.

50:27.065 --> 50:29.525
Exactly! All right,
I'll get him on the phone.

50:29.525 --> 50:31.152
(line ringing)

50:31.152 --> 50:33.405
This is a really big find.

50:33.405 --> 50:35.114
If this is original stuff,

50:35.114 --> 50:37.409
then this is exactly
what we've been looking for,

50:37.409 --> 50:41.788
more indications of original
people and their activities.

50:41.788 --> 50:43.664
-(phone ringing)
-RICK (on phone): Hello?

50:43.664 --> 50:47.126
-Hey, Rick.
-Hey, Jack. What's up?

50:47.126 --> 50:49.588
So Gary and I found something

50:49.588 --> 50:50.880
that we think
is really important

50:50.880 --> 50:52.090
and you need to come see.

50:52.090 --> 50:53.842
RICK:
Whereabouts are you?

50:53.842 --> 50:55.927
On the middle of Lot 2,

50:55.927 --> 50:59.097
about halfway between
the road and the water.

50:59.097 --> 51:02.266
RICK: We're pretty close.
I happen to be here with Doug.

51:02.266 --> 51:05.519
-We'll be right there.
-All right, sounds great.

51:05.519 --> 51:08.106
RICK:
 When Jack and Gary called,

51:08.106 --> 51:10.942
of course our ears go up,
our heads come up.

51:10.942 --> 51:14.195
What is it? If it's enough
to make them think they've...

51:14.195 --> 51:17.282
Well, they tagged it,
"significant find."

51:17.282 --> 51:19.159
Obviously, we're gonna go look.

51:19.159 --> 51:21.286
GARY:
Hey, guys.

51:21.286 --> 51:22.788
This cleared area here,

51:22.788 --> 51:25.123
we've been running across
big boulders,

51:25.123 --> 51:28.793
and this big boulder, here,

51:28.793 --> 51:30.336
gave up a nice surprise.

51:30.336 --> 51:32.297
-Really?
-GARY: Yup.

51:32.297 --> 51:34.715
We lifted the moss up,
and that's what we saw.

51:34.715 --> 51:38.302
JACK: You can see this boulder,
with a drill hole in it,

51:38.302 --> 51:40.639
and a piece of iron.

51:40.639 --> 51:42.641
GARY:
It looks like an old eyebolt.

51:42.641 --> 51:46.228
Why would this
be in this boulder?

51:46.228 --> 51:48.396
And this isn't just
an isolated boulder,

51:48.396 --> 51:52.025
if you look down here,
you can see them in a line.

51:52.025 --> 51:54.652
There's a lot of big boulders.

51:54.652 --> 51:56.822
RICK:
It's certainly unique.

51:56.822 --> 52:00.074
I mean, we've never found
anything else like this.

52:00.074 --> 52:01.992
Are there any other targets?

52:01.992 --> 52:04.161
We might be able
to get another signal

52:04.161 --> 52:05.831
once that moss is removed,

52:05.831 --> 52:08.750
and I get can get my search coil
further down.

52:08.750 --> 52:11.335
This is something I think Laird
would call cultural.

52:11.335 --> 52:14.213
Yup, it's an interesting find,
there's no doubt about it.

52:14.213 --> 52:15.673
You were right to stop

52:15.673 --> 52:17.550
because Laird needs
to render an opinion.

52:17.550 --> 52:20.971
NARRATOR: As part of their
 treasure trove license,

52:20.971 --> 52:23.514
the Oak Island team
must first consult

52:23.514 --> 52:26.643
with an approved archeologist
before digging any site

52:26.643 --> 52:28.519
that is believed
to be culturally

52:28.519 --> 52:30.188
or historically significant.

52:30.188 --> 52:31.356
-JACK: Another hole?
-Yeah.

52:31.356 --> 52:32.690
NARRATOR:
 For this reason,

52:32.690 --> 52:34.483
further exploration
of the stone

52:34.483 --> 52:37.362
and the area surrounding it
will have to wait

52:37.362 --> 52:42.032
until team archaeologist
Laird Niven can evaluate it.

52:42.032 --> 52:44.744
Well, kudos to both of you.
I mean, it's a great find.

52:44.744 --> 52:48.206
It's obviously something that
we can't explain, as of yet.

52:48.206 --> 52:51.041
We'll get Laird out here
and move on from there.

52:51.041 --> 52:52.585
And it's a new discovery
on Oak Island.

52:52.585 --> 52:53.920
RICK:
Absolutely.

52:53.920 --> 52:55.713
Any day you make
a new discovery,

52:55.713 --> 52:57.548
-it's pretty special.
-RICK: Yeah. No, yeah.

52:57.548 --> 53:00.719
Absolutely. Good job, guys.

53:00.719 --> 53:03.637
NARRATOR: While Rick
 and members of the team

53:03.637 --> 53:05.347
wait for Laird's arrival,

53:05.347 --> 53:08.934
some 300 miles northwest
of Oak Island,

53:08.934 --> 53:10.896
in the city of Fredericton...

53:10.896 --> 53:12.063
So this is looking good.

53:12.063 --> 53:13.231
NARRATOR:
 ...Craig Tester,

53:13.231 --> 53:14.608
Peter Fornetti,

53:14.608 --> 53:15.942
and Dave Blankenship

53:15.942 --> 53:18.235
are at
the University of New Brunswick

53:18.235 --> 53:20.905
where Dr. Chris McFarlane
is about to begin

53:20.905 --> 53:23.742
a chemical analysis
of the samples taken

53:23.742 --> 53:27.579
from the lead cross found
at Smith's Cove last year.

53:27.579 --> 53:30.164
CHRIS:
So right now just monitoring

53:30.164 --> 53:33.710
the signal that's coming
from that standard,

53:33.710 --> 53:36.670
and we're now measuring it
on the mass spectrometer.

53:36.670 --> 53:41.425
Okay, and so now
this is the cross.

53:41.425 --> 53:45.429
It's certainly noisier
because it's pure lead.

53:47.306 --> 53:50.434
That is a bit different.

53:50.434 --> 53:53.103
The black line here is silver.

53:53.103 --> 53:55.315
So this does have
some silver in it.

53:55.315 --> 53:57.442
NARRATOR:
 Silver?

53:57.442 --> 54:00.612
Is it possible that the cross
found at Smith's Cove

54:00.612 --> 54:03.614
contains trace amounts
of this precious metal?

54:03.614 --> 54:06.952
As early as the Bronze Age,

54:06.952 --> 54:09.119
silver was most commonly
found mixed

54:09.119 --> 54:12.123
with deposits of lead
or copper ore,

54:12.123 --> 54:15.168
which were actively mined
across the ancient world.

54:15.168 --> 54:17.503
The reason for this is simple:

54:17.503 --> 54:20.382
both lead and silver
are obtained

54:20.382 --> 54:25.302
from the same mineral source,
a mineral ore known as galena.

54:25.302 --> 54:27.514
Prior to modern advancements

54:27.514 --> 54:30.557
in refining practices
during the 19th century,

54:30.557 --> 54:33.769
most metal alloys
would contain trace amounts

54:33.769 --> 54:37.315
of other metals from which
they were extracted.

54:37.315 --> 54:40.777
Could finding traces
of silver be proof

54:40.777 --> 54:44.197
that the lead cross
dates from before the 1800s

54:44.197 --> 54:45.990
or even earlier?

54:45.990 --> 54:49.159
CHRIS:
I think artisanal lead,

54:49.159 --> 54:51.996
which has not been smelted
using modern techniques,

54:51.996 --> 54:53.831
still has a lot of stuff
left in it.

54:53.831 --> 54:55.666
-Okay.
-CHRIS: Okay.

54:55.666 --> 54:57.085
So, that was
the machine finishing.

54:57.085 --> 54:58.503
Everything's done,

54:58.503 --> 55:00.838
and so, the next step
is data reduction.

55:00.838 --> 55:03.842
-Okay.
-We shut down the torch.

55:07.012 --> 55:11.641
So there's our two ratios
of interest.

55:11.641 --> 55:14.811
There's the galena
and there's the cross.

55:14.811 --> 55:17.856
We can now compare that

55:17.856 --> 55:20.900
to some of the
North American deposits.

55:20.900 --> 55:22.193
Okay.

55:22.193 --> 55:24.820
I'll just put it into
my spreadsheet over here.

55:28.240 --> 55:29.909
There you go.

55:31.536 --> 55:35.248
So the cross is not,

55:35.248 --> 55:38.293
obviously, related to...

55:41.463 --> 55:43.630
...North America.

55:46.384 --> 55:48.719
(chuckles)

55:48.719 --> 55:50.387
-That's very good.
-Yeah.

55:50.387 --> 55:52.097
-Okay. Yeah.
-Yeah!

55:52.097 --> 55:53.766
(laughter)

55:53.766 --> 55:55.059
CRAIG: So, there's nothing
in North America

55:55.059 --> 55:56.769
that compares to that?

55:56.769 --> 55:58.605
Yeah, North American-wise.

55:58.605 --> 56:00.731
NARRATOR:
 Not from North America?

56:00.731 --> 56:05.945
Could it be that not only
the lead, but the cross itself

56:05.945 --> 56:08.447
came to Oak Island
from somewhere as far away

56:08.447 --> 56:10.909
as Europe or the Middle East?

56:10.909 --> 56:13.744
And could this news offer
further validation

56:13.744 --> 56:17.164
that the cross is, in fact,
centuries old

56:17.164 --> 56:19.416
and of Templar origin?

56:19.416 --> 56:22.253
-That's great news, then.
-PETER: Yeah.

56:22.253 --> 56:24.922
-We want it to come from Europe.
-Yeah.

56:24.922 --> 56:27.092
So, hopefully,
that's where it-it's pointing.

56:27.092 --> 56:28.760
From my perspective,
it's looking good.

56:28.760 --> 56:30.010
I think that's great.
Appreciate it.

56:30.010 --> 56:31.387
Yup.

56:31.387 --> 56:33.347
-CHRIS: Good luck.
-CRAIG: Thank you.

56:39.269 --> 56:40.730
NARRATOR: Shortly after
 receiving the results

56:40.730 --> 56:42.565
of the laser ablation test

56:42.565 --> 56:45.777
conducted on the mysterious
lead cross,

56:45.777 --> 56:47.445
Craig Tester
has called together

56:47.445 --> 56:48.947
his partners
for a conference call

56:48.947 --> 56:50.739
in the Oak Island war room.

56:50.739 --> 56:52.617
-Hey, Craig.
-Hey, Craig.

56:52.617 --> 56:54.159
-Hey, guys.
-MARTY: Make it good, Craig.

56:54.159 --> 56:56.411
CRAIG:
Okay.

56:56.411 --> 56:59.916
So we had the laser ablation
done on the lead cross,

56:59.916 --> 57:02.626
and, so, what they did,
they-they ran a test

57:02.626 --> 57:04.963
to try to determine what mine

57:04.963 --> 57:06.630
this lead might have come from.

57:06.630 --> 57:09.717
The test results
are very interesting.

57:09.717 --> 57:11.594
Tell us.

57:11.594 --> 57:14.639
Really, they just spit out
a tremendous amount of data

57:14.639 --> 57:16.349
concerning the isotopes.

57:16.349 --> 57:19.726
And the-the
very good news is, um,

57:19.726 --> 57:23.898
you know, they have
a very extensive, uh, database

57:23.898 --> 57:26.483
for North America

57:26.483 --> 57:29.320
and it doesn't match up with
anything from North America.

57:29.320 --> 57:30.487
-Wow!
-So, the lead cross

57:30.487 --> 57:31.905
is not from North America.

57:34.659 --> 57:37.536
Well, that's gigantic.
That's actually a relief.

57:37.536 --> 57:39.329
-That's huge.
-Wow.

57:39.329 --> 57:40.831
I mean, look,
I was always intrigued,

57:40.831 --> 57:42.833
from the moment that cross
came out of the ground,

57:42.833 --> 57:45.335
it-it-it looked eerily identical

57:45.335 --> 57:47.505
to the carving in Domme
that we all saw.

57:47.505 --> 57:49.673
Well, Peter, Alex saw.

57:49.673 --> 57:52.177
JERRY:
Over here is some of the most

57:52.177 --> 57:55.179
well-known carvings at Domme.
This way.

57:55.179 --> 57:57.639
NARRATOR: While visiting
 a 14th-century prison

57:57.639 --> 57:59.016
in Domme, France last year,

57:59.016 --> 58:01.351
Rick Lagina, along with nephews

58:01.351 --> 58:03.980
Alex Lagina and Peter Fornetti

58:03.980 --> 58:06.065
were shown a number of carvings

58:06.065 --> 58:08.693
known to have been made by
members of the Knights Templar

58:08.693 --> 58:10.527
during their years
of captivity.

58:10.527 --> 58:13.697
RICK: They obviously wanted
to keep that symbolism alive.

58:13.697 --> 58:18.161
NARRATOR: Incredibly, one of
the carvings was eerily similar

58:18.161 --> 58:21.706
to the lead cross
found at Smith's Cove.

58:21.706 --> 58:24.041
Now, with this...

58:24.041 --> 58:26.501
this evidence, if you will,

58:26.501 --> 58:29.047
that UNB is telling us

58:29.047 --> 58:30.882
it's not North American lead,

58:30.882 --> 58:33.342
it certainly doesn't eliminate
the possibility

58:33.342 --> 58:35.385
that this is, indeed,
a Templar connection.

58:36.971 --> 58:38.722
MARTY:
We haven't eliminated it.

58:38.722 --> 58:40.557
This would've killed it,
is another way to say it.

58:40.557 --> 58:42.518
This would've killed it,
if it was North American.

58:42.518 --> 58:44.353
-But it didn't.
-MARTY: But it didn't.

58:44.353 --> 58:46.438
The initial data is great.

58:46.438 --> 58:49.067
Now we take the next step,
you know,

58:49.067 --> 58:52.570
further define when and where
that cross was made.

58:52.570 --> 58:55.405
Give us a really complete
understanding

58:55.405 --> 58:59.744
of what this artifact
can tell us.

58:59.744 --> 59:03.789
Wow, so this thing has some
story to tell us yet, then.

59:03.789 --> 59:06.251
If it was not made or mined
in North America,

59:06.251 --> 59:09.211
where the heck did it
come from? Huh.

59:09.211 --> 59:10.588
RICK: Did they give you
any insight, Craig?

59:10.588 --> 59:12.257
About where we go next?

59:12.257 --> 59:16.760
Um, now, they suggested we,
you know, we look to Europe.

59:16.760 --> 59:18.137
Um, there's a lot
of different places

59:18.137 --> 59:20.472
that might have experts
in different areas.

59:20.472 --> 59:24.018
So I think we need
to just start searching around.

59:24.018 --> 59:27.105
Well, I know, for me,
it-it just ramps up our interest

59:27.105 --> 59:28.690
in doing the Smith's Cove work.

59:28.690 --> 59:33.277
I-- Gary always talks about,
surely, it has friends.

59:33.277 --> 59:35.905
Okay, so, let's see
where the data leads us.

59:35.905 --> 59:37.614
-Let's proceed.
-Okay.

59:37.614 --> 59:39.784
-See you, Craig.
-See you, Craig.

59:39.784 --> 59:41.827
CRAIG:
 See you guys soon.

59:48.626 --> 59:51.461
NARRATOR: After receiving
 the incredible news

59:51.461 --> 59:53.505
that the lead found
in the cross

59:53.505 --> 59:56.092
came from somewhere
other than North America,

59:56.092 --> 01:00:00.471
Rick Lagina and archaeologist
Laird Niven join Gary Drayton

01:00:00.471 --> 01:00:04.976
to inspect the mysterious
drilled stone on Lot 2.

01:00:04.976 --> 01:00:06.728
GARY:
It's right here, guys.

01:00:09.105 --> 01:00:10.523
Okay.

01:00:13.900 --> 01:00:16.653
I mean, this has been altered,
but it's almost like it's been,

01:00:16.653 --> 01:00:18.822
it's almost like
it's impacted like this.

01:00:18.822 --> 01:00:20.949
GARY: Yeah, 'cause if you look
here, there's a mark here,

01:00:20.949 --> 01:00:24.369
-where they started the...
-Yeah. Started a hole.

01:00:26.121 --> 01:00:27.831
No, well, that is strange.

01:00:27.831 --> 01:00:30.793
It's just unusual to see
that pin in there.

01:00:30.793 --> 01:00:33.170
That's a unique feature
we've never seen anywhere else.

01:00:33.170 --> 01:00:35.172
-LAIRD: Nope.
-Uh...

01:00:35.172 --> 01:00:37.925
So I guess what
you would like to do

01:00:37.925 --> 01:00:42.012
is peel back the moss,
and see if we can't

01:00:42.012 --> 01:00:44.389
see more evidence that compels
us to go down the road

01:00:44.389 --> 01:00:46.851
of "Hey, this might
be significant."

01:00:46.851 --> 01:00:48.978
I'm eager to see
what's under that moss.

01:00:48.978 --> 01:00:50.146
Well, let's photograph it first.

01:00:50.146 --> 01:00:51.731
Okay.

01:00:56.068 --> 01:00:57.320
Ah...

01:01:00.322 --> 01:01:01.865
Oh, look at that.

01:01:01.865 --> 01:01:03.909
LAIRD:
Big root, there.

01:01:03.909 --> 01:01:05.494
Did we bring the snips?

01:01:05.494 --> 01:01:07.413
RICK: We did, uh, yes,
they're right behind.

01:01:09.873 --> 01:01:11.876
Oh, yeah, there's more.

01:01:11.876 --> 01:01:14.670
Yeah, look at that face.

01:01:14.670 --> 01:01:17.047
LAIRD:
Oh, there you go.

01:01:17.047 --> 01:01:18.757
RICK: There's one there,
there's one there,

01:01:18.757 --> 01:01:20.842
there's one there.

01:01:20.842 --> 01:01:23.387
We pull the moss back,
and there's a bunch of, uh,

01:01:23.387 --> 01:01:25.222
other drill holes and, uh,

01:01:25.222 --> 01:01:27.224
you know,
why were they doing that?

01:01:27.224 --> 01:01:29.018
Why this specific rock?

01:01:31.311 --> 01:01:33.063
But there's definitely...

01:01:33.063 --> 01:01:37.402
Here, here, here, here, here.

01:01:39.152 --> 01:01:41.655
GARY: And they're all
the same diameter, as well.

01:01:41.655 --> 01:01:43.907
Perhaps dating the spikes,

01:01:43.907 --> 01:01:46.494
they'll be able to tell us
when this work went on.

01:01:46.494 --> 01:01:47.744
RICK:
Yeah.

01:01:47.744 --> 01:01:49.579
That is the one key,

01:01:49.579 --> 01:01:52.208
the one interesting thing
is how old is the metal?

01:01:52.208 --> 01:01:55.585
And the hope would be that if
we can give it to Dr. Brousseau

01:01:55.585 --> 01:01:57.922
and she can give us
a date range on it--

01:01:57.922 --> 01:01:59.757
if it pre-dates the discovery
of the Money Pit,

01:01:59.757 --> 01:02:01.717
then-then it's very interesting.

01:02:03.927 --> 01:02:05.471
Look at that.

01:02:05.471 --> 01:02:09.349
Do you see any significance
to this?

01:02:17.817 --> 01:02:18.985
-See it?
-This?

01:02:18.985 --> 01:02:20.235
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

01:02:20.235 --> 01:02:23.197
RICK:
Right here.

01:02:23.197 --> 01:02:25.740
Is there a way we can
clean that up a little bit?

01:02:25.740 --> 01:02:27.452
LAIRD: Yeah, we can try
pouring some water on it,

01:02:27.452 --> 01:02:28.702
see what that does.

01:02:28.702 --> 01:02:29.744
RICK:
Yeah, try it.

01:02:29.744 --> 01:02:31.746
(exhaling sharply)

01:02:31.746 --> 01:02:35.460
LAIRD:
Um...

01:02:35.460 --> 01:02:37.670
It looks like a triangle to me.

01:02:41.423 --> 01:02:46.637
I mean, it could be,
it could be chiseled.

01:02:46.637 --> 01:02:52.101
I know, uh, you know, Masons
all had their specific mark.

01:02:52.101 --> 01:02:54.978
NARRATOR:
 A carved triangle?

01:02:54.978 --> 01:02:57.815
Possibly made by Freemasons?

01:02:57.815 --> 01:03:01.318
For more than two centuries,
the secretive fraternity

01:03:01.318 --> 01:03:03.987
of builders known
as the Freemasons

01:03:03.987 --> 01:03:08.284
have left an undeniable mark
on the Oak Island mystery.

01:03:08.284 --> 01:03:10.869
Not only have prominent
treasure hunters,

01:03:10.869 --> 01:03:14.039
including Daniel McGinnis,
M.R. Chappell

01:03:14.039 --> 01:03:17.585
and Franklin Delano Roosevelt,
all been members,

01:03:17.585 --> 01:03:22.005
but well-known Masonic symbols
such as triangles

01:03:22.005 --> 01:03:23.632
and even the sacred letter G,

01:03:23.632 --> 01:03:26.677
representing the great
or divine architect,

01:03:26.677 --> 01:03:31.139
have been found carved
on stones all over the island.

01:03:31.139 --> 01:03:34.559
I can't think of a single
example anywhere on the island

01:03:34.559 --> 01:03:38.523
where you see this type
of rock deformation,

01:03:38.523 --> 01:03:40.148
so we should
look into it further.

01:03:40.148 --> 01:03:42.150
This may turn out to be
something connected

01:03:42.150 --> 01:03:43.860
to the island and the mystery.

01:03:43.860 --> 01:03:47.239
I'm curious to see if that
really is a-a carving,

01:03:47.239 --> 01:03:49.492
-or even an attempt
at a carving.
-Yeah.

01:03:49.492 --> 01:03:51.452
Then that makes
this significant.

01:03:51.452 --> 01:03:54.371
Pushes one to: "Well,
what was the purpose of that?"

01:03:54.371 --> 01:03:56.541
They chose this
for some reason, yeah.

01:03:56.541 --> 01:03:58.376
That's the question
we're left with right now.

01:03:58.376 --> 01:04:03.047
RICK: Maybe they did this work
to leave a message.

01:04:03.047 --> 01:04:05.090
So, it's interesting.

01:04:05.090 --> 01:04:06.300
Yes.

01:04:14.474 --> 01:04:17.811
NARRATOR: As a new day begins
 on Oak Island...

01:04:17.811 --> 01:04:19.271
Are you getting ready to set off

01:04:19.271 --> 01:04:21.065
-another set of charges?
-Yeah.

01:04:21.065 --> 01:04:22.942
...and the team
from Eagle Canada continue

01:04:22.942 --> 01:04:25.027
their seismic
scanning operation

01:04:25.027 --> 01:04:27.070
at the Money Pit site...

01:04:33.119 --> 01:04:34.579
MARTY:
 Okay, so, just real quick,

01:04:34.579 --> 01:04:37.164
-tie it all together.
-Fair enough.

01:04:37.164 --> 01:04:40.208
NARRATOR: ...Marty Lagina
 and his nephew Peter Fornetti

01:04:40.208 --> 01:04:43.420
are about to conduct another
investigation at Smith's Cove.

01:04:43.420 --> 01:04:45.005
This is the port.

01:04:45.005 --> 01:04:47.632
Joining them
are geophysicist Mike West

01:04:47.632 --> 01:04:49.260
and his associate
Andrew Gillis.

01:04:49.260 --> 01:04:51.387
-That's it? We're functional?
-MIKE W.: Yeah.

01:04:51.387 --> 01:04:52.929
Down the hill.

01:04:55.724 --> 01:04:58.226
Yeah, you guys have
done some work here.

01:04:58.226 --> 01:05:00.813
Yeah. We're going to do
a pretty massive excavation

01:05:00.813 --> 01:05:02.023
-down at Smith's Cove.
-Okay.

01:05:02.023 --> 01:05:03.523
We're gonna put in a cofferdam.

01:05:03.523 --> 01:05:05.985
-Right, right.
-Just past Dan's old cofferdam.

01:05:05.985 --> 01:05:07.777
You can see it already,
coming into view.

01:05:07.777 --> 01:05:13.284
We had Gary Drayton do normal
metal detecting there.

01:05:13.284 --> 01:05:15.661
And the EM61,
which you're bringing, right?

01:05:15.661 --> 01:05:17.579
-Yep.
-Goes much deeper.

01:05:17.579 --> 01:05:21.291
Yes, it's basically more of a
high-power metal detection unit.

01:05:21.291 --> 01:05:24.628
NARRATOR: Unlike conventional
 metal detection devices,

01:05:24.628 --> 01:05:28.215
the EM61 device is designed
to sense metal objects

01:05:28.215 --> 01:05:31.260
at depths of nearly 20 feet.

01:05:31.260 --> 01:05:35.222
Equipped with a GPS mechanism,
it can pinpoint the position

01:05:35.222 --> 01:05:38.099
of any metallic target
to within centimeters

01:05:38.099 --> 01:05:41.311
of its exact location
below ground.

01:05:41.311 --> 01:05:43.021
Let me get you lined out here.

01:05:43.021 --> 01:05:45.650
It is the team's hope
that the data collected

01:05:45.650 --> 01:05:48.485
can be used to create a map
of potential dig sites

01:05:48.485 --> 01:05:50.655
for the major
excavation planned

01:05:50.655 --> 01:05:52.364
to happen here this year.

01:05:52.364 --> 01:05:54.157
We're gonna be
excavating about where

01:05:54.157 --> 01:05:56.202
-that little pond is
right there.
-Yeah.

01:05:56.202 --> 01:05:58.536
MARTY: That's where
the U-shaped structure is.

01:05:58.536 --> 01:06:01.748
What if you went
from that metal deal...

01:06:01.748 --> 01:06:04.085
What if you, kind of, tried
to do this pie piece here first?

01:06:04.085 --> 01:06:05.835
-MIKE W.: Yeah.
-See what I'm saying?

01:06:05.835 --> 01:06:09.507
To do this whole area, with
this, will take some time.

01:06:09.507 --> 01:06:12.050
-That's kind of
what we want you to do.
-Yeah. Yeah.

01:06:12.050 --> 01:06:14.052
MARTY: All right, okay. Well,
you got your marching orders.

01:06:14.052 --> 01:06:16.179
Uh, Rick has some other stuff
for me to do, Pete.

01:06:16.179 --> 01:06:19.182
So I'm gonna skedaddle,
but you know, get what you can

01:06:19.182 --> 01:06:20.726
and then when the tide goes out,
get more.

01:06:20.726 --> 01:06:23.353
-Okay.
-All right, carry on.

01:06:23.353 --> 01:06:25.815
-All right, see you.
-See you.

01:06:25.815 --> 01:06:28.108
NARRATOR: While Mike West
 and Andrew Gillis begin

01:06:28.108 --> 01:06:32.237
their deep scan for metal
artifacts at Smith's Cove,

01:06:32.237 --> 01:06:36.367
Rick Lagina, Craig Tester
and Dave Blankenship

01:06:36.367 --> 01:06:38.911
travel some 150 miles northwest

01:06:38.911 --> 01:06:41.746
to the city of Saint John,
New Brunswick.

01:06:41.746 --> 01:06:45.166
I don't know about you guys, but
I'm very interested in seeing

01:06:45.166 --> 01:06:47.711
this technology they're going
to apply to provide us

01:06:47.711 --> 01:06:51.005
with a proper plan for
the project in Smith's Cove.

01:06:51.005 --> 01:06:52.800
CRAIG:
Oh, absolutely. I mean,

01:06:52.800 --> 01:06:56.344
I just got to believe we're
gonna find a lot of things.

01:06:56.344 --> 01:06:58.722
NARRATOR: They have arranged
 a meeting at the headquarters

01:06:58.722 --> 01:07:01.307
of Irving Equipment, Limited,
the company that,

01:07:01.307 --> 01:07:04.561
for the past three years,
has been chiefly responsible

01:07:04.561 --> 01:07:08.440
for all of the major drilling
operations on Oak Island.

01:07:08.440 --> 01:07:09.900
Hey, guys.

01:07:09.900 --> 01:07:11.277
-David. Good to see you again.
-Welcome.

01:07:11.277 --> 01:07:12.652
Good to see you, as well.
How are things?

01:07:12.652 --> 01:07:14.070
Good. Good, very good, actually.

01:07:14.070 --> 01:07:16.239
-Good? Craig, good.
-Nice to see you.

01:07:16.239 --> 01:07:18.324
Dave, how you doing?
So welcome to Irving Equipment.

01:07:18.324 --> 01:07:20.077
-RICK: Thank you.
Thank you very much.
-CRAIG: Thank you.

01:07:20.077 --> 01:07:21.746
Yeah, we got a couple tricks
up our sleeve

01:07:21.746 --> 01:07:23.121
we're looking to showcase
for you guys today,

01:07:23.121 --> 01:07:25.416
but hopefully, just have
a good discussion about

01:07:25.416 --> 01:07:27.585
Smith's Cove,
what you want to do.

01:07:27.585 --> 01:07:30.086
-Okay.
-Perfect.
-Let's go. Follow me.

01:07:30.086 --> 01:07:32.840
NARRATOR: This year,
 in addition to the Money Pit,

01:07:32.840 --> 01:07:35.467
the Laginas and their partners
want to expand

01:07:35.467 --> 01:07:38.804
the team's excavation efforts
to include Smith's Cove,

01:07:38.804 --> 01:07:41.806
where, last year,
Rick and Gary Drayton

01:07:41.806 --> 01:07:44.434
found the mysterious
lead cross.

01:07:44.434 --> 01:07:49.440
Because of its location at the
ocean, digging at Smith's Cove

01:07:49.440 --> 01:07:54.277
will require the team to first
construct a massive cofferdam.

01:07:54.277 --> 01:07:58.157
It will also require
a large investment of money,

01:07:58.157 --> 01:08:00.034
as well as numerous permits
and permissions

01:08:00.034 --> 01:08:01.786
from the government.

01:08:01.786 --> 01:08:04.704
CRAIG: If we can get a proper
 cofferdam in place,

01:08:04.704 --> 01:08:08.166
I think we can prove up
the flood system

01:08:08.166 --> 01:08:11.961
and which direction it goes
and lead us to the Money Pit.

01:08:11.961 --> 01:08:14.547
DAVID I.:
Gentlemen, welcome to Lift Lab.

01:08:14.547 --> 01:08:16.884
Here we have with us our
engineering folks, as well as

01:08:16.884 --> 01:08:19.551
-some of the folks from
our pile driving department.
-Okay.

01:08:19.551 --> 01:08:21.555
Let's just summarize a little
bit about what we talked about.

01:08:21.555 --> 01:08:24.809
Sure. From previous
discussions, we, uh,

01:08:24.809 --> 01:08:28.060
understand the scope as being
that you need a structure

01:08:28.060 --> 01:08:31.398
that will hold back the water
to permit excavation

01:08:31.398 --> 01:08:33.567
and exploration
around the Smith's Cove area.

01:08:33.567 --> 01:08:37.363
So, uh, we also understand that
you would like to possibly dig

01:08:37.363 --> 01:08:40.948
down ten feet in the Smith's
Cove area as well.

01:08:40.948 --> 01:08:43.786
So, um, we have
our proposal here to, uh,

01:08:43.786 --> 01:08:46.412
-to review with you guys.
-Great.

01:08:46.412 --> 01:08:48.038
In order to, really, sort of,
immerse yourselves

01:08:48.038 --> 01:08:50.751
in the plan that we're
presenting here,

01:08:50.751 --> 01:08:53.377
we're gonna talk with this
augmented reality technology.

01:08:53.377 --> 01:08:55.506
It's not full virtual reality.

01:08:55.506 --> 01:08:58.006
With VR, you're totally blocking
out everything around you,

01:08:58.006 --> 01:09:00.176
and you're just looking at
a totally virtual environment.

01:09:00.176 --> 01:09:02.511
What we want to do is be able
to take the lift plans

01:09:02.511 --> 01:09:05.515
that we've designed and then
superimpose the equipment,

01:09:05.515 --> 01:09:09.353
the structure, on a digital
representation of the island.

01:09:09.353 --> 01:09:11.063
The benefits of that
are that you get

01:09:11.063 --> 01:09:13.564
that immersive experience,
without losing sight of what

01:09:13.564 --> 01:09:16.402
we're really trying to talk
about, which is the worksite,

01:09:16.402 --> 01:09:18.237
and how what we're planning
on putting on the worksite

01:09:18.237 --> 01:09:20.072
fits together.

01:09:20.072 --> 01:09:22.448
NARRATOR:
 With applications ranging

01:09:22.448 --> 01:09:25.033
from the medical
to engineering fields,

01:09:25.033 --> 01:09:28.203
augmented reality
is an emerging technology,

01:09:28.203 --> 01:09:30.875
whereby computer-generated
sensory data,

01:09:30.875 --> 01:09:32.667
such as imagery and sound,

01:09:32.667 --> 01:09:34.627
can alter
an individual's perception

01:09:34.627 --> 01:09:38.046
of actual, real-life
environments.

01:09:38.046 --> 01:09:40.966
Put simply, it creates
a three-dimensional simulation

01:09:40.966 --> 01:09:42.761
of the physical world.

01:09:42.761 --> 01:09:45.555
-Julien, do you have a headset?
-Yep, right here.

01:09:45.555 --> 01:09:48.765
NARRATOR: Using a headset device
 known as a HoloLens,

01:09:48.765 --> 01:09:51.228
the digital model
can be manipulated

01:09:51.228 --> 01:09:53.564
by simple hand movements.

01:09:53.564 --> 01:09:56.734
JULIEN: What I'm gonna do now
is load up a hologram.

01:09:56.734 --> 01:09:58.985
There's cameras on the front
of these HoloLens goggles.

01:09:58.985 --> 01:10:03.323
So you're gonna see
my output here on the screen.

01:10:03.323 --> 01:10:05.618
The HoloLens technology uses
hand gestures, so...

01:10:05.618 --> 01:10:07.953
You can see it here,
it's kind of small scale,

01:10:07.953 --> 01:10:11.582
so we'll make it a little bit
bigger and drag it.

01:10:14.376 --> 01:10:16.086
That's amazing.

01:10:16.086 --> 01:10:17.837
And I'm gonna to rotate it
around so the cove

01:10:17.837 --> 01:10:19.756
is facing you guys, so you can
see the cove in the front.

01:10:19.756 --> 01:10:24.011
And I'll grab it here and kind
of rotate it around for you.

01:10:24.011 --> 01:10:25.762
So there you can see--

01:10:25.762 --> 01:10:27.597
you can't see it in front
of you, but I can see it.

01:10:27.597 --> 01:10:29.600
There's a cove right there
on the table for you.

01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:31.726
DAVID I.: That's sort of
the starting point.

01:10:31.726 --> 01:10:35.104
We can also now look
at the CAD files

01:10:35.104 --> 01:10:36.606
that we developed
on top of this.

01:10:36.606 --> 01:10:40.027
So, there we are there.
There's your cranes.

01:10:40.027 --> 01:10:42.988
Again, showing the range
of the working profile there.

01:10:42.988 --> 01:10:46.533
VICTOR: Okay, so, to summarize
all the discussions

01:10:46.533 --> 01:10:48.743
on how actually will we
install this cofferdam,

01:10:48.743 --> 01:10:50.496
we would start
to construct a road

01:10:50.496 --> 01:10:52.997
from the Money Pit area all
the way right down to the beach.

01:10:52.997 --> 01:10:54.958
It's a road that's going to be

01:10:54.958 --> 01:10:56.627
about, approximately,
500 feet long.

01:10:56.627 --> 01:10:59.128
Once we get down
to the beach area,

01:10:59.128 --> 01:11:01.547
then we would construct
a crane pad.

01:11:01.547 --> 01:11:03.425
What this crane pad
is going to do,

01:11:03.425 --> 01:11:06.470
it's going to allow us to crane
back and forth, as required,

01:11:06.470 --> 01:11:08.805
to drive the sheets
from the center point

01:11:08.805 --> 01:11:10.849
all the way back
to the shoreline.

01:11:10.849 --> 01:11:13.185
We also talked
about the old cofferdam

01:11:13.185 --> 01:11:15.479
that was constructed
back in 1970.

01:11:15.479 --> 01:11:18.649
As you can see, it's kind of
like a darker, shaded area here.

01:11:18.649 --> 01:11:21.234
That's, that will show you
exactly the...

01:11:21.234 --> 01:11:24.320
kind of like the footprint
of the old, existing structure.

01:11:24.320 --> 01:11:26.907
And, as you can see,
we'll be outside of that.

01:11:26.907 --> 01:11:30.368
So it allows us soil support
inside of the cofferdam.

01:11:30.368 --> 01:11:32.912
You know, we're-we're
retaining back a minimum,

01:11:32.912 --> 01:11:34.872
on high tide,
of six feet of water.

01:11:34.872 --> 01:11:37.251
So, the forces
are-are significant, for sure.

01:11:37.251 --> 01:11:39.420
It definitely gives you
a sense of scale

01:11:39.420 --> 01:11:41.505
because we know
how big that crane is.

01:11:41.505 --> 01:11:44.298
Look-look at the amount of earth
we have to deal with.

01:11:44.298 --> 01:11:46.010
It's intimidating.

01:11:46.010 --> 01:11:48.011
Yeah, it is a big structure.

01:11:48.011 --> 01:11:49.179
Certainly the biggest project
we've undertaken so far.

01:11:49.179 --> 01:11:50.722
Oh, yeah.

01:11:50.722 --> 01:11:52.975
RICK: You know,
 it was very helpful to see

01:11:52.975 --> 01:11:55.853
a bird's-eye view, literally,
of the Smith's Cove work,

01:11:55.853 --> 01:11:57.813
of the scope of it,
the scale of it.

01:11:57.813 --> 01:12:01.274
Here it is, in real time,
what we're about to undertake,

01:12:01.274 --> 01:12:03.694
and as I'm looking at it,
I'm thinking to myself,

01:12:03.694 --> 01:12:05.112
you know what?

01:12:05.112 --> 01:12:06.195
Time waits for no one.

01:12:06.195 --> 01:12:07.905
We have to get this started.

01:12:07.905 --> 01:12:09.867
Is there anything else that
we need to talk about here

01:12:09.867 --> 01:12:12.786
or do we... do you guys
think that we're good to go?

01:12:12.786 --> 01:12:16.832
-What do you think?
-I-I think we're good to go.

01:12:16.832 --> 01:12:19.460
Good.

01:12:19.460 --> 01:12:21.670
I think, I just want
to affirm to you guys

01:12:21.670 --> 01:12:24.715
why this project is so important
to us, on a number of levels.

01:12:24.715 --> 01:12:26.591
You know, everyone says
that the puzzle,

01:12:26.591 --> 01:12:28.551
the mystery, actually started

01:12:28.551 --> 01:12:31.764
upon finding the Money Pit
in 1795.

01:12:31.764 --> 01:12:33.974
The truth is, my suspicion is

01:12:33.974 --> 01:12:37.935
that the original depositors,
this is where they started

01:12:37.935 --> 01:12:41.314
because there was something
they had that was so valuable

01:12:41.314 --> 01:12:43.567
that they needed to protect it

01:12:43.567 --> 01:12:46.028
and that's why they
had to create this.

01:12:46.028 --> 01:12:48.322
The other thing is,
we found this cross,

01:12:48.322 --> 01:12:50.323
but we believe
there are other artifacts

01:12:50.323 --> 01:12:52.743
in the area where it was found
and in association

01:12:52.743 --> 01:12:54.578
with this U-shaped structure.

01:12:54.578 --> 01:12:56.829
So we'd like to get
to the bottom of the importance

01:12:56.829 --> 01:12:58.957
of Smith's Cove and the work
that was done there.

01:12:58.957 --> 01:13:01.001
Now, with your assistance,
your help,

01:13:01.001 --> 01:13:05.171
we think we're on the precipice
of unraveling that mystery.

01:13:05.171 --> 01:13:08.966
Um, will it find treasure?
Will it find answers?

01:13:08.966 --> 01:13:12.554
You know, maybe write a page
into this ever-evolving story?

01:13:12.554 --> 01:13:14.139
I think it will.

01:13:14.139 --> 01:13:16.015
Well, let's seal it
on a handshake, then, and...

01:13:16.015 --> 01:13:17.684
I'm old school. Handshake.

01:13:17.684 --> 01:13:18.851
-Done deal.
-Sounds good.

01:13:18.851 --> 01:13:19.895
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

01:13:19.895 --> 01:13:20.895
-Let's get it done.
-Thanks, guys.

NARRATOR: Following their trip
to Irving Equipment, Limited...

01:13:33.367 --> 01:13:35.577
-Let me give Marty a call.
-Yeah.

01:13:35.577 --> 01:13:39.581
NARRATOR: ...Craig Tester,
 Dave Blankenship

01:13:39.581 --> 01:13:42.292
and Rick Lagina call
Rick's brother Marty

01:13:42.292 --> 01:13:44.962
to update him
on their morning meeting.

01:13:44.962 --> 01:13:46.963
Hey, Marty, you there?

01:13:46.963 --> 01:13:48.966
MARTY (over phone):
Yeah, Craig.

01:13:48.966 --> 01:13:51.635
-Hey.
-What's going on?

01:13:51.635 --> 01:13:53.636
-We went
to Irving's office today.
-MARTY: Okay.

01:13:53.636 --> 01:13:56.515
We discussed Smith's Cove,
putting the pilings in.

01:13:56.515 --> 01:13:57.807
MARTY:
Oh, all right.

01:13:57.807 --> 01:14:00.018
CRAIG:
Rick and I felt confident

01:14:00.018 --> 01:14:01.811
that they could do the job.

01:14:01.811 --> 01:14:04.689
So, we said, "Sure, we'll-we'll
do it with you guys."

01:14:04.689 --> 01:14:05.983
MARTY:
Yep.

01:14:05.983 --> 01:14:07.693
David agreed as well,
right, Dave?

01:14:07.693 --> 01:14:10.779
-Yep.
-MARTY: I concur.

01:14:10.779 --> 01:14:13.448
I did see the pictures you sent,
and it's exciting

01:14:13.448 --> 01:14:14.908
to see that picture,
and see that dyke

01:14:14.908 --> 01:14:17.034
holding back the sea
and then being able

01:14:17.034 --> 01:14:18.662
to work in there in the dry.

01:14:18.662 --> 01:14:20.747
I'm just hoping that could
really happen, you know.

01:14:20.747 --> 01:14:23.125
-Yeah, I agree.
-Yep.

01:14:23.125 --> 01:14:25.668
MARTY: The excavation
 at Smith's Cove is going to be

01:14:25.668 --> 01:14:27.880
the biggest thing
that we've done here,

01:14:27.880 --> 01:14:31.091
uh, since we've
embarked on this quest.

01:14:31.091 --> 01:14:32.967
I have some trepidation
about it.

01:14:32.967 --> 01:14:35.345
It's going to be,
it's going to be a lot of work.

01:14:35.345 --> 01:14:37.722
This is more about eyes
and boots on the ground,

01:14:37.722 --> 01:14:39.557
getting dirty, jumping in,

01:14:39.557 --> 01:14:41.350
making real finds,
real discoveries.

01:14:41.350 --> 01:14:43.311
So, I'm very much
looking forward to it.

01:14:43.311 --> 01:14:45.939
It's... finally, we're getting
our hands dirty again.

01:14:45.939 --> 01:14:48.192
It is a treasure hunt,
after all.

01:14:48.192 --> 01:14:50.152
MARTY:
Well, well done, guys.

01:14:50.152 --> 01:14:52.654
I'm happy with the result
and yes, I'm firmly on board.

01:14:52.654 --> 01:14:54.155
Okay.

01:14:54.155 --> 01:14:55.782
-MARTY: Release the hounds!
-Yeah.

01:14:55.782 --> 01:14:58.659

 As Rick, Craig and Dave

01:15:02.206 --> 01:15:03.873
make their way back
to Oak Island,

01:15:03.873 --> 01:15:07.502
Rick's nephew Peter Fornetti,

01:15:07.502 --> 01:15:10.505
along with geophysicist
Mike West

01:15:10.505 --> 01:15:12.548
and his associate
Andrew Gillis,

01:15:12.548 --> 01:15:15.510
continue their search
for artifacts at Smith's Cove.

01:15:15.510 --> 01:15:18.012
(beeping)

01:15:21.682 --> 01:15:23.393
There's certainly
something right there.

01:15:23.393 --> 01:15:25.561
-PETER: Right-right
where you are?
-Yeah.

01:15:25.561 --> 01:15:27.396
Do you know any depth
with that or...

01:15:27.396 --> 01:15:29.690
No, but it's-it's a pretty
big response, yeah.

01:15:29.690 --> 01:15:31.234
PETER:
Oh, yeah?

01:15:31.234 --> 01:15:32.903
It's even, like,
the millibel reading, uh,

01:15:32.903 --> 01:15:34.695
is even off the scale.

01:15:34.695 --> 01:15:36.405
We're up in the, you know,
3000, 3,400 millibels.

01:15:36.405 --> 01:15:37.908
-Our baseline's
right around zero
-PETER: Mm-hmm.

01:15:37.908 --> 01:15:39.076
and that's, you know,
that's spiking

01:15:39.076 --> 01:15:40.536
o-off the charts right there.

01:15:40.536 --> 01:15:43.872
And I don't,
I don't see any evidence

01:15:43.872 --> 01:15:46.375
of any kind of metal on surface.

01:15:46.375 --> 01:15:48.542
So, there's something
really big deep?

01:15:48.542 --> 01:15:50.587
MIKE W.: Yeah. This isn't
a subtle response.

01:15:50.587 --> 01:15:53.881
NARRATOR:
 A large, metal object

01:15:53.881 --> 01:15:56.717
buried deep below the surface
at Smith's Cove?

01:15:56.717 --> 01:16:01.806
Could it be related to the lead
cross found here last year?

01:16:01.806 --> 01:16:04.600
That's one that

01:16:04.600 --> 01:16:06.728
-I'd certainly take a look at.
-PETER: Yeah.

01:16:06.728 --> 01:16:08.396
MIKE W.: We'll create some maps.
We'll find these targets.

01:16:08.396 --> 01:16:10.899
We can come back
at a later date and dig them.

01:16:10.899 --> 01:16:12.609
We definitely will. (chuckles)

01:16:12.609 --> 01:16:15.779
NARRATOR: Although Mike
 is certain that the EM61

01:16:15.779 --> 01:16:18.782
has detected the presence
of a significant metal target,

01:16:18.782 --> 01:16:21.493
the team will have
to wait until today's scans

01:16:21.493 --> 01:16:24.954
can be properly analyzed
before they can determine

01:16:24.954 --> 01:16:27.916
the object's exact
GPS location.

01:16:27.916 --> 01:16:29.626
Maybe I'll get one more pass.

01:16:29.626 --> 01:16:31.420
And then we'll hop
to the other side?

01:16:31.420 --> 01:16:32.837
And then we'll jump
to the other side.

01:16:32.837 --> 01:16:35.090
Awesome. Perfect.

01:16:42.764 --> 01:16:44.474
NARRATOR:
 The next day...

01:16:44.474 --> 01:16:46.768
-I think we just
go right in here.
-Yeah.

NARRATOR:
 ...Rick Lagina

01:16:48.311 --> 01:16:49.938
and metal detection expert
Gary Drayton...

01:16:49.938 --> 01:16:51.480
-Start right here, actually.
-Yep.

01:16:51.480 --> 01:16:53.608
...continue
their ongoing search

01:16:53.608 --> 01:16:55.152
for important clues,

01:16:55.152 --> 01:16:58.822
this time on Lot 21.

01:16:58.822 --> 01:17:01.783
Well, this is 21.
We've never been in here before.

01:17:01.783 --> 01:17:04.786
You've got the McGinnis
foundation over there.

01:17:04.786 --> 01:17:06.829
Uh, let's see what we find.

01:17:06.829 --> 01:17:09.123
Right.

01:17:09.123 --> 01:17:12.127
-Let's go, lucky digger.
-Let's go.

01:17:12.127 --> 01:17:16.922
NARRATOR: Shortly after Daniel
McGinnis and two of his friends

01:17:16.922 --> 01:17:19.801
discovered the Money Pit
in 1795,

01:17:19.801 --> 01:17:23.680
the young man moved
to Oak Island and built a home.

01:17:23.680 --> 01:17:27.684
Here, he lived
for the remainder of his life,

01:17:27.684 --> 01:17:32.021
farming, raising a family
and searching for treasure.

01:17:32.021 --> 01:17:35.984
Three years ago,
while visiting the island,

01:17:35.984 --> 01:17:38.737
three of Daniel McGinnis's
direct descendants

01:17:38.737 --> 01:17:42.783
shared an incredible story with
Rick, Marty and the team...

01:17:42.783 --> 01:17:48.204
Now, I've been told they found
three treasure chests.

01:17:48.204 --> 01:17:52.583
And what is in this box
is one of the things

01:17:52.583 --> 01:17:54.711
that came from that chest.

01:17:54.711 --> 01:17:56.630
NARRATOR: ...along
 with an amazing object...

01:17:56.630 --> 01:17:58.881
Oh, my goodness.

01:17:58.881 --> 01:18:00.591
NARRATOR:
...that Daniel reportedly found

01:18:00.591 --> 01:18:02.719
some 30 feet deep
in the Money Pit.

01:18:02.719 --> 01:18:04.720
MARTY:
Wow.

01:18:04.720 --> 01:18:08.725
NARRATOR: Although the remains
 of Daniel McGinnis's house

01:18:08.725 --> 01:18:10.976
were removed
more than a century ago,

01:18:10.976 --> 01:18:16.817
the rock foundation remains
as a protected historical site.

01:18:16.817 --> 01:18:21.238
Because of this, Rick and Gary
are careful not to disturb

01:18:21.238 --> 01:18:24.783
any areas within 100 feet
of the foundation,

01:18:24.783 --> 01:18:27.411
in hopes their search
of the surrounding ground

01:18:27.411 --> 01:18:29.246
will yield important
information.

01:18:29.246 --> 01:18:30.747
(metal detector whoops)

01:18:30.747 --> 01:18:33.457
It's only reading
three or four inches.

01:18:33.457 --> 01:18:36.586
(beeping)

01:18:36.586 --> 01:18:39.547
I'm getting readings
over here, as well.

01:18:47.889 --> 01:18:50.225
Ooh, look at that.

01:18:50.225 --> 01:18:53.228
-Is that an oldie?
-I don't know.

01:18:53.228 --> 01:18:55.271
That looks old.

01:18:55.271 --> 01:18:57.399
Let's have a look, see if
I see any screw threads.

01:18:57.399 --> 01:18:59.609
Yeah, I can...
these are old screws.

01:18:59.609 --> 01:19:02.737
-Mm-hmm.
-So we've got an hinge.

01:19:02.737 --> 01:19:04.864
-We need the chest.
-Chest.

01:19:04.864 --> 01:19:06.783
And that's how it is
on Oak Island a lot of times.

01:19:06.783 --> 01:19:10.619
Once you find
one or two good things,

01:19:10.619 --> 01:19:14.541
you find a lot of things
in the same area.

01:19:24.967 --> 01:19:27.970
Oh, come on, just one more nice,
little signal around here.

01:19:27.970 --> 01:19:30.890
Really, what we need to do
is just circle this area

01:19:30.890 --> 01:19:34.394
-a couple times.
-Yeah.

01:19:39.274 --> 01:19:43.069
(beeping)

01:19:43.069 --> 01:19:46.072
Well, that doesn't
sound too bad.

01:19:46.072 --> 01:19:48.992
(steady beeping)

01:19:48.992 --> 01:19:50.452
Just there.

01:19:58.835 --> 01:20:00.587
You never, ever know

01:20:00.587 --> 01:20:02.463
what's gonna come out
of your next hole.

01:20:02.463 --> 01:20:05.175
What do I always say?

01:20:05.175 --> 01:20:08.177
Just win, baby,
change your whole day.

01:20:08.177 --> 01:20:09.804
Here we go.

01:20:09.804 --> 01:20:11.847
(beeping)

01:20:11.847 --> 01:20:14.100
Still sounding good,
still looking good.

01:20:17.311 --> 01:20:20.398
Oh, my gosh.

01:20:20.398 --> 01:20:23.693
It's another bobby-dazzler.
Look!

01:20:31.033 --> 01:20:32.743
NARRATOR: While metal detecting
 on Lot 21...

01:20:32.743 --> 01:20:34.246
Bloody hell.

01:20:34.246 --> 01:20:36.206
NARRATOR:
...Rick Lagina and Gary Drayton

01:20:36.206 --> 01:20:40.377
have just made an astonishing
and potentially historic find.

01:20:40.377 --> 01:20:42.127
That's a stone.

01:20:42.127 --> 01:20:43.380
RICK:
That's a brooch.

01:20:43.380 --> 01:20:44.881
GARY:
That's a bloody brooch.

01:20:44.881 --> 01:20:46.716
Look at that. That's a gem.

01:20:46.716 --> 01:20:49.051
RICK:
That's red, too.

01:20:49.051 --> 01:20:50.720
NARRATOR:
 A jeweled brooch

01:20:50.720 --> 01:20:53.180
found on the western side
of Oak Island

01:20:53.180 --> 01:20:56.100
and nearly a mile
from the Money Pit?

01:20:56.100 --> 01:20:59.061
It's heavy.
You know, feel-feel the...

01:20:59.061 --> 01:21:01.564
-We did it again.
-(laughs)

01:21:01.564 --> 01:21:03.399
RICK: Feel the weight on that
compared to the other one.

01:21:03.399 --> 01:21:06.069
-Oh, look at that.
-Isn't that much heavier?

01:21:06.069 --> 01:21:10.114
NARRATOR: Could it be related
to the one discovered last year

01:21:10.114 --> 01:21:14.327
on Lot 8, which not only
contained a semiprecious jewel,

01:21:14.327 --> 01:21:19.832
but which might also date as
far back as the 16th century?

01:21:19.832 --> 01:21:23.420
Gary reached in and,
there it is, the brooch.

01:21:23.420 --> 01:21:27.591
And, uh, you know, it's a "Holy
schmoly" moment for Gary.

01:21:27.591 --> 01:21:29.259
Wow.

01:21:29.259 --> 01:21:31.094
RICK:
 And it is for me, too.

01:21:31.094 --> 01:21:33.762
It was hard not to get excited
because if it predates

01:21:33.762 --> 01:21:36.807
searcher activity, it's
absolutely an excellent find.

01:21:36.807 --> 01:21:38.768
Look at that.

01:21:38.768 --> 01:21:40.770
Is that some sort
of ornament there,

01:21:40.770 --> 01:21:42.271
some sort of ornament there?

01:21:42.271 --> 01:21:44.649
I mean, a lot of work
went into that.

01:21:44.649 --> 01:21:46.775
That's why I'm thinking
this could be special.

01:21:46.775 --> 01:21:48.653
I just think the...

01:21:48.653 --> 01:21:52.489
how ornate it is, is going
to tell us something.

01:21:52.489 --> 01:21:54.283
It's beautiful.

01:21:54.283 --> 01:21:56.328
-That is unbelievable.
-I-I think...

01:21:56.328 --> 01:21:57.953
-The brooch brothers are back.
-(laughs)

01:21:57.953 --> 01:22:00.289
Lucky diggers.

01:22:00.289 --> 01:22:01.707
Right, you know what?

01:22:01.707 --> 01:22:04.085
-Top-pocket find.
-Top-pocket find.

01:22:04.085 --> 01:22:07.255
Just make sure you zip it up.
(chuckles)

01:22:07.255 --> 01:22:11.091
NARRATOR:
For Rick, Marty and their team,

01:22:11.091 --> 01:22:14.429
the discovery of what may be
an actual piece of treasure

01:22:14.429 --> 01:22:19.391
offers a momentous start to
their new year on Oak Island.

01:22:19.391 --> 01:22:23.646
But could it also validate
their belief

01:22:23.646 --> 01:22:26.983
that, at some time,
perhaps centuries ago,

01:22:26.983 --> 01:22:30.319
a group of people came here
for the purpose

01:22:30.319 --> 01:22:33.614
of hiding something
of incredible value

01:22:33.614 --> 01:22:37.493
like gold and jewels
buried by pirates,

01:22:37.493 --> 01:22:41.331
the lost manuscripts
of William Shakespeare,

01:22:41.331 --> 01:22:43.917
precious, religious artifacts

01:22:43.917 --> 01:22:47.002
taken from
the Temple of King Solomon?

01:22:47.002 --> 01:22:50.923
Or could it be something
small and modest,

01:22:50.923 --> 01:22:55.052
like a simple lead cross,
which, when analyzed,

01:22:55.052 --> 01:22:57.555
could change history

01:22:57.555 --> 01:23:00.516
and which was discovered
on an area of the island

01:23:00.516 --> 01:23:04.311
that waits to be explored?

01:23:07.148 --> 01:23:10.318
Next time on
The Curse of Oak Island...

01:23:10.318 --> 01:23:12.737
We got two broaches
and two red gemstones.

01:23:12.737 --> 01:23:14.905
-Yes.
-RICK: That's pretty amazing.

01:23:14.905 --> 01:23:17.367
This is not your ordinary gem.

01:23:17.367 --> 01:23:19.536
-It's super ancient.
-DAVE: Now we're cooking.

01:23:19.536 --> 01:23:20.869
These artifacts are
pushing us back

01:23:20.869 --> 01:23:22.287
farther in time
than I ever thought.

01:23:22.287 --> 01:23:23.539
-Here it comes.
-RICK: For the first time

01:23:23.539 --> 01:23:25.041
in two and a quarter centuries,

01:23:25.041 --> 01:23:26.542
we can look underground
in the Money Pit.

01:23:26.542 --> 01:23:28.293
We can give you guys
some answers.

01:23:28.293 --> 01:23:29.628
MARTY:
What are the lighter spots?

01:23:29.628 --> 01:23:30.796
I would say it's pure gold.

01:23:30.796 --> 01:23:32.215
GARY:
Holy schmoly!

01:23:32.215 --> 01:23:33.675
MARTY:
 We have found our first gold

01:23:33.675 --> 01:23:35.719
on Oak Island.
