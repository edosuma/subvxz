WEBVTT

00:04.080 --> 00:06.620
 Okay, here we are.

00:06.620 --> 00:08.460
Thank you for being
our designated driver.

00:08.460 --> 00:10.080
Oh, I figured you needed
to blow off a little steam

00:10.080 --> 00:11.210
after the week you had.

00:11.210 --> 00:12.830
Forget about
being left back.

00:12.830 --> 00:14.120
You just need to make peace

00:14.120 --> 00:15.170
with being
back in long sleeves.

00:15.170 --> 00:16.500
I have.
No, you haven't.

00:16.500 --> 00:19.000
No, I haven't.

00:19.000 --> 00:21.120
Oh, guys.

00:23.000 --> 00:29.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:30.210 --> 00:31.670
911, what's your emergency?

00:31.670 --> 00:34.920
This if off-duty officer
Jackson West, badge 33356.

00:34.920 --> 00:36.330
I need a unit to my home

00:36.330 --> 00:38.620
for an on-view suspect
dealing eleven-three.

00:38.620 --> 00:40.000
I'm gonna cut around
the back side, cut 'em off.

00:45.580 --> 00:47.000
Police.
Get down on the ground,

00:47.000 --> 00:48.380
keep your hands
where I can see them.

00:48.380 --> 00:50.250
Foot pursuit!
Westbound in the alley!

00:50.250 --> 00:51.960
Suspect's a male, white,
5'10", 200 pounds.

00:59.580 --> 01:01.330
Suspect in custody.

01:01.330 --> 01:02.380
Yo, you slinging dope
in my neighborhood?

01:05.580 --> 01:07.330
Mr. Wilson?

01:07.330 --> 01:08.880
Oh, hey, Jackson.

01:08.880 --> 01:10.250
You know this guy?

01:10.250 --> 01:12.000
Yeah, he's my landlord.

01:29.580 --> 01:30.920
 You ever heard of
a Night General?

01:30.920 --> 01:32.330
No, sir.

01:32.330 --> 01:34.120
Night General Detectives.

01:34.120 --> 01:36.080
They respond
to any major crime scene

01:36.080 --> 01:37.330
after normal
business hours.

01:37.330 --> 01:39.080
They work the case
until it's assigned.

01:39.080 --> 01:40.540
They have to be a master
in everything

01:40.540 --> 01:41.790
because they see
everything.

01:41.790 --> 01:43.750
Sounds impressive.
It is.

01:43.750 --> 01:45.420
And most of them got
the attitude to go with it.

01:45.420 --> 01:47.540
This my tour guide?

01:47.540 --> 01:49.170
I thought you were
assigning me a rookie.

01:49.170 --> 01:50.710
I am a rookie, sir.
John Nolan.

01:51.750 --> 01:53.500
Nick Armstrong.

01:53.500 --> 01:55.540
Detective Armstrong
is our new Night Detective.

01:55.540 --> 01:57.960
He asked for a patrol officer
to show him around,

01:57.960 --> 01:59.920
help him get familiar
with our division.

01:59.920 --> 02:01.790
Yeah, just did a ten spot
up in the seven-seven,

02:01.790 --> 02:04.170
so I don't know none
of the players in
this part of town.

02:04.170 --> 02:07.170
Hell, I don't know where
to get a decent cup of coffee.

02:07.170 --> 02:08.380
Well, I got you covered
on the coffee.

02:08.380 --> 02:09.460
I'll do my best
on the rest.

02:09.460 --> 02:11.210
Fair enough.

02:11.210 --> 02:12.960
Alright, it's roll call time.
You want to come?

02:12.960 --> 02:14.670
Yeah.
First day of school,

02:14.670 --> 02:16.170
might as well meet
the other kids.

02:16.170 --> 02:17.000
Were you Night General
back at the seven-seven?

02:17.000 --> 02:18.750
Yeah.
Last five years.

02:18.750 --> 02:20.790
After my wife died,
I found the nights the hardest,

02:20.790 --> 02:22.460
so I filled 'em.
Oh, I'm sorry.

02:22.460 --> 02:24.250
Married?
Divorced.

02:24.250 --> 02:25.830
Before or after
you signed up?
Before.

02:25.830 --> 02:27.420
Part of the catalyst
to make the change.

02:27.420 --> 02:28.830
Change is hard.
I hate it, man.

02:28.830 --> 02:30.290
But here I am.
Life is contradictory.

02:30.290 --> 02:31.620
Tell me about it.

02:31.620 --> 02:32.880
 Settle down.
Find a seat.

02:34.250 --> 02:36.080
First up,

02:36.080 --> 02:38.420
I'd like to congratulate
Officer Jackson West

02:38.420 --> 02:39.880
on a fine pinch last night.

02:41.170 --> 02:43.830
No crook is safe
from Officer West,

02:43.830 --> 02:45.330
not even his landlord.

02:45.330 --> 02:47.420
Letter of commendation?
Change of address form.

02:47.420 --> 02:49.880
Your apartment is now considered
a "house of ill repute"...

02:49.880 --> 02:51.880
...and under asset seizure.

02:51.880 --> 02:53.620
We need your new address
by tomorrow,

02:53.620 --> 02:54.830
even if it's Mama's house.

02:54.830 --> 02:56.460
Alright.

02:56.460 --> 02:58.750
This sharp-dressed man
in the doorway

02:58.750 --> 03:01.380
is Detective Nick Armstrong.

03:01.380 --> 03:02.790
He'll be in the field
after hours

03:02.790 --> 03:04.040
for your detecting needs.

03:04.040 --> 03:05.710
Yes, Officer Lopez?

03:05.710 --> 03:08.170
Detective Armstrong,
on a scale of 1 to 10,

03:08.170 --> 03:09.790
where 1 is "patrol friendly"

03:09.790 --> 03:11.830
and 10 is "making us guard
a cleared crime scene

03:11.830 --> 03:13.210
in the pouring rain

03:13.210 --> 03:14.880
'cause you get
a power trip off of it,"

03:14.880 --> 03:16.080
where do you stand?

03:16.080 --> 03:17.460
 Lopez.

03:17.460 --> 03:18.830
No, it's alright, Sarge.

03:18.830 --> 03:20.960
I appreciate
a direct question.

03:20.960 --> 03:22.330
A lot of cops
take off the uniform,

03:22.330 --> 03:23.620
they put on the suit.

03:23.620 --> 03:24.880
Suddenly, they think
they're better

03:24.880 --> 03:26.080
than the officers
in this room.

03:26.080 --> 03:27.460
I'm not one of them.

03:27.460 --> 03:29.830
Patrol is where
it all happens.

03:29.830 --> 03:32.080
It's fast, honest,
pure, raw.

03:32.080 --> 03:35.500
85% of all crimes are solved
at the patrol level.

03:35.500 --> 03:39.250
So, the way I see it,
I am here to help you,

03:39.250 --> 03:41.170
not the other way around.

03:41.170 --> 03:42.880
And if that doesn't
win you over,

03:42.880 --> 03:44.750
I have five dozen
of the finest donuts

03:44.750 --> 03:46.080
in the break room.

03:46.080 --> 03:47.080
That's all I'm saying.

03:48.670 --> 03:51.290
Detective, you think you can
buy us with donuts?

03:51.290 --> 03:53.290
Absolutely not.

03:53.290 --> 03:54.830
Maybe rent you, though.

03:57.330 --> 03:59.250
Okay, are we done?
Good, 'cause we're done.

03:59.250 --> 04:01.080
Be safe out there.

04:01.080 --> 04:03.170
Bradford,
let me see you a sec.

04:06.920 --> 04:08.330
Chief Williams
added another book

04:08.330 --> 04:10.170
to your Sergeants Exam
reading list.

04:10.170 --> 04:11.290
"Split Second Leadership

04:11.290 --> 04:13.040
Leading Men
In The Line Of Duty."

04:13.040 --> 04:14.380
Men?
It's from the '60s.

04:14.380 --> 04:16.829
How is this relevant
to 21st-century policing?

04:16.829 --> 04:20.120
Ours is not to reason why,
Officer Bradford.

04:20.120 --> 04:21.579
Read the book.

04:21.579 --> 04:23.540
Yes, sir.

04:26.620 --> 04:28.380
Sergeant Grey is
setting me up to fail.

04:28.380 --> 04:30.120
You see that, right?
No. I really don't.

04:30.120 --> 04:31.830
Come on,
there's no way

04:31.830 --> 04:33.290
I'm gonna find someplace
to live in one day.

04:33.290 --> 04:34.920
Not with that attitude.

04:34.920 --> 04:37.170
7 to 10 days would be
a reasonable amount of time.

04:37.170 --> 04:39.540
It's at the sergeant's
discretion.

04:39.540 --> 04:41.540
Just like sticking me
back in long sleeves
was at his discretion.

04:41.540 --> 04:43.670
You know, I know two guys
from the academy

04:43.670 --> 04:45.120
who both got 80s,
and they're both
in short sleeves.

04:46.380 --> 04:47.710
Why's he penalizing me?

04:47.710 --> 04:48.960
You know,
I think I liked you better

04:48.960 --> 04:50.290
when you were a coward.

04:50.290 --> 04:51.670
You complained less.

04:53.330 --> 04:56.620
 If I have to suffer,
so do you.

04:56.620 --> 04:58.620
So, you're gonna read this
out loud to me between calls.

04:58.620 --> 05:00.710
Only way I'm gonna get it
memorized in time.

05:00.710 --> 05:01.920
Or I could drive

05:01.920 --> 05:04.080
and you could read it
to yourself.

05:04.080 --> 05:05.920
Nice try.
Start reading.

05:05.920 --> 05:07.880
Okay.

05:07.880 --> 05:09.670
"Chapter One.

05:09.670 --> 05:12.460
True leadership
generates respect, not fear.

05:12.460 --> 05:15.710
It elevates people,
rather than diminishing them."

05:15.710 --> 05:17.290
I like this book.

05:17.290 --> 05:18.710
You would.

05:18.710 --> 05:20.790
Keep reading.

05:20.790 --> 05:22.210
"The number-one mistake
new leaders make

05:22.210 --> 05:25.040
is to think themselves
suddenly infallible.

05:25.040 --> 05:27.000
The best leaders understand

05:27.000 --> 05:29.210
that even
the lowliest patrol officer

05:29.210 --> 05:31.170
has something valuable
to teach them."

05:31.170 --> 05:33.500
Repeat that last part
back to me.

05:35.120 --> 05:37.250
Memorizing
is all about repetition.

05:37.250 --> 05:38.670
Trust me.
I'm a psych major.

05:38.670 --> 05:40.580
I-I know this stuff.

05:40.580 --> 05:42.040
The best leaders understand

05:42.040 --> 05:43.420
that even
the lowliest patrol officer

05:43.420 --> 05:45.170
has something valuable
to teach them.

05:45.170 --> 05:46.210
Again.

05:47.670 --> 05:49.290
 7-Adam-19,

05:49.290 --> 05:51.460
family disturbance
at 217 Evergreen.

05:51.460 --> 05:52.880
Thank God.

05:52.880 --> 05:54.920
7-Adam-19, copy.
En route.

05:54.920 --> 05:57.620
Okay, ETA three minutes.
Time to read some more.

05:57.620 --> 06:00.670
"An open mind
and an open door..."

06:00.670 --> 06:02.920
And that's why
phase three recruits

06:02.920 --> 06:04.960
all have tan left arms.

06:04.960 --> 06:07.170
I am not gonna lie,

06:07.170 --> 06:09.880
the change to short sleeves
has been life-altering.

06:09.880 --> 06:13.290
I remember it well.

06:13.290 --> 06:15.710
Then I quickly, uh,
moved into suits.

06:15.710 --> 06:17.540
I mean,
it's not as hot as wool,

06:17.540 --> 06:19.460
but it's not cool,
either.

06:19.460 --> 06:21.040
How long did it take you
to make the move?

06:21.040 --> 06:22.670
What? Uh, detective?

06:22.670 --> 06:24.000
Four years.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.540
I didn't think
that was possible.

06:26.540 --> 06:28.000
Yeah, well, I'm still
the only cop who's done it.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.170
But I still wonder if I 
if I moved too quickly.

06:30.170 --> 06:32.750
Well, speaking as someone
who wants to move up rapidly,

06:32.750 --> 06:34.170
I am officially
your number-one fan.

06:34.170 --> 06:35.710
If there's any hints
you can dispense,

06:35.710 --> 06:37.210
I am all ears.

06:37.210 --> 06:38.580
You hook me up
on the local 411,

06:38.580 --> 06:40.210
and I'll dispense
a little knowledge.

06:40.210 --> 06:41.960
Deal.

06:41.960 --> 06:43.880
 All units,
incoming four-fifteen.

06:43.880 --> 06:45.500
Shaw Memorial.

06:45.500 --> 06:46.920
Security fighting
with unknown male.

06:46.920 --> 06:48.880
I haven't been in a fight
in a while.

06:48.880 --> 06:50.250
Buy that call.

06:50.250 --> 06:51.330
Let's go get
in some trouble.

06:51.330 --> 06:53.330
Sure.
Here we go.

06:53.330 --> 06:55.000
They're gonna kill
each other!

06:55.000 --> 06:56.460
My boys  they bought
these military vests

06:56.460 --> 06:57.750
off the Internet,

06:57.750 --> 06:59.120
and they wanna
try them out!

06:59.120 --> 07:00.500
Bulletproof vests?
Oh, I hope so.

07:00.500 --> 07:02.620
They won't listen to me.
Maybe you'll listen to them.

07:02.620 --> 07:04.670
I called the cops.
Ma'am, get in the house.
Get in the house.

07:04.670 --> 07:06.750
Put the guns down!
Put 'em down!
 3, 2, 1.

07:06.750 --> 07:07.710
Drop your weapons!

07:09.420 --> 07:11.620
Oh, my God!

07:11.620 --> 07:13.420
Stay in the house.
 See, I told you
they'd work.

07:13.420 --> 07:14.540
Drop the guns, right now!
Drop your weapon now!

07:14.540 --> 07:16.250
 Relax.
We were just messing around.

07:16.250 --> 07:18.380
J-Bag bet me
the vests wouldn't work.

07:19.830 --> 07:21.120
 You been drinking,

07:21.120 --> 07:22.920
or are you normally
this stupid?

07:22.920 --> 07:24.000
Get up.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.830
I-I don't feel so good.

07:26.830 --> 07:28.330
Tim.

07:28.330 --> 07:29.880
Tim.
 Look at you!

07:29.880 --> 07:31.330
You guys never listen
to what I'm saying.

07:31.330 --> 07:33.500
I won the bet.
What bet? He's dying!

07:33.500 --> 07:35.380
It doesn't matter!
It was his idea to
buy the vests!

07:35.380 --> 07:36.960
7-Adam-19.
I need an ambulance.

07:36.960 --> 07:38.380
Gunshot wound
to the upper torso.

07:38.380 --> 07:39.750
Mom,
go back in the house!

07:39.750 --> 07:41.620
He's bleeding.
What are you doing here?

07:41.620 --> 07:42.960
 Excuse me,
excuse me, excuse me.

07:42.960 --> 07:44.460
Just came in
on a 5150 hold.

07:44.460 --> 07:46.460
He got loose.
He's high on something.

07:46.460 --> 07:48.000
 Whoa.

07:50.830 --> 07:53.460
Hey, big guy. Hey.

07:53.460 --> 07:55.750
We don't want anybody
hurting you, okay?

07:55.750 --> 07:57.420
Tase him,
tase him, tase him!

08:10.620 --> 08:11.920
Come on, big guy. Come on.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.580
Grace?
John?

08:28.620 --> 08:29.670
I'm open to ideas.

08:37.419 --> 08:39.460
Are you okay?
Yes.

08:39.460 --> 08:41.580
Yeah, I probably should
have...stretched before that.

08:42.789 --> 08:44.330
How long have you been
a cop?

08:44.330 --> 08:46.210
Six months.
You're kidding me.

08:46.210 --> 08:47.750
I mean, they didn't let me
touch a patient for three years.

08:47.750 --> 08:50.120
Oh, well, I think LAPD
puts value on

08:50.120 --> 08:51.620
"on the job" training.

08:51.620 --> 08:53.500
I thought you were gonna be
a painter.

08:53.500 --> 08:55.960
I mean,
things happened, so...

08:55.960 --> 08:58.670
What did you give him,
and can I get some?

09:00.250 --> 09:01.830
Detective Armstrong,
this is Grace.

09:01.830 --> 09:02.880
Hi.
Nice to meet you.

09:02.880 --> 09:04.080
How do you know Nolan?

09:04.080 --> 09:05.290
We went
to college together.

09:05.290 --> 09:06.830
Briefly.

09:06.830 --> 09:08.960
Gunshot victim coming in!

09:08.960 --> 09:10.920
Good seeing you again,
John.

09:10.920 --> 09:12.080
Nice to meet you,
Detective.

09:12.080 --> 09:14.750
Nice to meet you.

09:14.750 --> 09:16.000
This the first time
you've seen her since?

09:16.000 --> 09:18.170
Yeah.

09:18.170 --> 09:19.380
She looks good.

09:21.420 --> 09:22.920
Come on. Yep.

09:22.920 --> 09:23.960
Come on.

09:23.960 --> 09:25.790
No.

09:28.790 --> 09:30.420
Come on. Come on.

09:31.750 --> 09:32.540
Hey, West.

09:32.540 --> 09:34.170
What's up?

09:34.170 --> 09:35.750
You find a place
to live yet?

09:35.750 --> 09:37.960
Smitty, it's only been,
like, two hours.

09:37.960 --> 09:40.540
After you book your DUI,
meet me at the west gate.

09:41.580 --> 09:42.960
Oh.

09:49.710 --> 09:51.790
Smitty?

10:00.920 --> 10:03.080
Jackson. Welcome home.

10:03.080 --> 10:05.000
Home?
That's right.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.120
You have a chance to stay
at the best-kept secret

10:07.120 --> 10:08.460
in the LAPD 

10:08.460 --> 10:11.000
Shangri-La Westgate.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.580
Low maintenance,
zero commute,

10:13.580 --> 10:15.710
and a vacation is easy as

10:15.710 --> 10:17.830
"Gentlemen,
start your engines."

10:17.830 --> 10:20.330
Smitty, you live in
the police station parking lot.

10:20.330 --> 10:23.710
I even have the password
to the coffee shop WiFi.

10:23.710 --> 10:25.750
Baller, isn't it?

10:25.750 --> 10:27.670
"Baller" is not the first word
that comes to mind,

10:27.670 --> 10:29.290
and not one that sounds good
coming out of your mouth.

10:29.290 --> 10:32.040
But...you know what?

10:32.040 --> 10:34.330
This actually is
something that might 
 Boot!

10:34.330 --> 10:37.170
I told you to meet me
at the shop!

10:37.170 --> 10:39.670
$400 a month,
zero security deposit.

10:39.670 --> 10:40.880
We got a deal?

10:40.880 --> 10:42.170
Let's go!

10:43.330 --> 10:44.790
Let me get back to you.

10:47.420 --> 10:50.210
Alright, so, what's the deal
with Dr. Grace?

10:50.210 --> 10:52.290
What do you mean?

10:52.290 --> 10:53.960
Mm, noticed a little
something-something
under the surface.

10:53.960 --> 10:56.330
You didn't catch it?

10:56.330 --> 11:00.040
No, but I was, uh,
a little preoccupied.

11:00.040 --> 11:02.880
You know, surprise,
adrenaline, head trauma.

11:02.880 --> 11:05.080
Okay.

11:05.080 --> 11:06.250
What 
What do you think it was?

11:06.250 --> 11:08.210
Hey, I  No idea.
No idea.

11:08.210 --> 11:11.290
 7-Adam-15,
manually activated panic alarm.

11:11.290 --> 11:13.040
Multiple distress activations.

11:13.040 --> 11:15.620
7-Adam-15, responding.

11:15.620 --> 11:17.170
Code 2 High.

11:21.290 --> 11:23.420
Is this locked?

11:23.420 --> 11:24.830
Let's try the side
of the house first.

11:36.880 --> 11:38.040
Hey.

11:39.290 --> 11:41.080
Look.

11:43.880 --> 11:45.500
Police! Come on out!

11:45.500 --> 11:46.500
Show me your hands!

11:49.290 --> 11:50.420
 I got you.
I got you.

11:50.420 --> 11:51.830
 It's okay.
Oh, oh, oh.

11:51.830 --> 11:53.620
Alright.
They have Jeff.

11:53.620 --> 11:55.290
They have our son.

11:55.290 --> 11:56.460
There's 
There's two of them.
Shh. It's okay.

11:56.460 --> 11:58.120
-They're upstairs.
-How long ago?

11:58.120 --> 11:59.880
Uh, 20 minutes,
half hour.

11:59.880 --> 12:02.170
Home invasion, possible 207.
We're clearing the house now.

12:02.170 --> 12:04.710
Stay here.
Okay. Okay.

12:38.790 --> 12:40.670
 Clear!

12:52.710 --> 12:54.120
Jeff?

12:56.750 --> 12:57.960
No.
I'm sorry.

12:57.960 --> 13:00.540
No! Jeff!

13:04.540 --> 13:06.120
God...
I'm sorry.

13:10.330 --> 13:13.210
So, what we got?
Uh, victim's name

13:13.210 --> 13:14.540
is Jeff Christian,
17 years old.

13:14.540 --> 13:15.790
Apparently gunshot wound
to the back.

13:15.790 --> 13:17.080
Any others?
Yeah.

13:17.080 --> 13:18.250
Matt and Marilyn Christian.
Parents.

13:18.250 --> 13:19.580
Both assaulted.

13:19.580 --> 13:21.170
Described
two masked assailants.

13:21.170 --> 13:23.330
Males, white,
maybe Hispanic.

13:23.330 --> 13:25.620
5'9" to 5'11",
medium build.

13:25.620 --> 13:28.880
Uh, the primary wore
white sneakers with
a red triangle.

13:28.880 --> 13:30.880
I already put out a BOLO
citywide.

13:30.880 --> 13:32.620
Can I tell you,
it's nice to have

13:32.620 --> 13:34.420
a detective
here from the get-go.
Yeah.

13:34.420 --> 13:36.290
Now, you want the on-call
homicide dicks to respond?

13:36.290 --> 13:38.210
Nah, I'll take this one.
Anything special

13:38.210 --> 13:39.580
you want them
to pay attention to?

13:39.580 --> 13:41.210
Uh, there was a piece
of electrical tape

13:41.210 --> 13:42.210
covering
the doorbell camera.

13:44.790 --> 13:46.330
Hey.

13:46.330 --> 13:48.330
75% of cops would have
missed that tape.

13:48.330 --> 13:50.210
That's a nice spot,
Officer Nolan.

13:50.210 --> 13:52.540
You want to work with me
on this one?

13:52.540 --> 13:53.620
Yes, sir, I do.

13:53.620 --> 13:55.040
Good. Come on.

13:58.670 --> 14:03.040
Mr. and Mrs. Christian, I...

14:03.040 --> 14:07.120
I am, uh...

14:07.120 --> 14:08.540
I'm sorry.

14:08.540 --> 14:12.040
All I can offer
is a promise.

14:12.040 --> 14:15.120
I will hunt the men
who did this.

14:15.120 --> 14:17.750
I will hunt them
to the ends of the Earth,

14:17.750 --> 14:20.380
and I will not stop
until I find them.

14:20.380 --> 14:23.580
If there's anything you need,
the LAPD is here for you.

14:23.580 --> 14:25.120
Thank you.

14:26.750 --> 14:28.170
Would you excuse us?

14:36.170 --> 14:37.710
What do we got?

14:37.710 --> 14:39.790
Is that a puncture wound
on the elbow?

14:39.790 --> 14:42.290
Yeah. Entry wound.

14:42.290 --> 14:44.170
The bullet
entered the elbow,

14:44.170 --> 14:46.420
probably bounced off
the humerus bone,

14:46.420 --> 14:47.830
severed the brachial,

14:47.830 --> 14:50.620
and then came
out of the back.

14:50.620 --> 14:54.040
What's this fluid
in his mouth?

14:54.040 --> 14:56.670
Pulmonary edema, but let's
let the coroner handle that.

14:56.670 --> 14:57.620
Any sign of struggle?

14:57.620 --> 14:59.460
Uh...

14:59.460 --> 15:02.170
Not really, but...

15:02.170 --> 15:04.210
how does someone
get shot in the elbow?

15:04.210 --> 15:06.290
Reaching for a loaded gun.

15:06.290 --> 15:08.420
But what does lunging
for a gun suggest?

15:08.420 --> 15:09.710
He was fighting back.
Eventually,

15:09.710 --> 15:11.170
but why wait so long?

15:11.170 --> 15:14.330
Was he trying
to reason with them?
Maybe.

15:14.330 --> 15:15.880
But maybe shooting the kid
wasn't the original plan,

15:15.880 --> 15:16.960
but once he grabbed the gun 

15:16.960 --> 15:18.500
Bang. No choice.

15:18.500 --> 15:20.750
But why are they
in this room?

15:20.750 --> 15:22.580
The master bedroom,
the parents' room 

15:22.580 --> 15:24.500
that's where
all the expensive stuff is.

15:26.920 --> 15:28.750
But here...

15:28.750 --> 15:30.500
Wait a minute.

15:36.000 --> 15:38.080
Cubby hole.

15:38.080 --> 15:40.170
Prescription pills.

15:42.420 --> 15:44.250
Yeah.

15:44.250 --> 15:45.540
I'm gonna have to let
the lab confirm,

15:45.540 --> 15:48.040
but I'm saying
that's Oxycontin.

15:48.040 --> 15:49.290
You think maybe
this was the real target?

15:49.290 --> 15:50.830
See that piece of plastic
on that nail?

15:50.830 --> 15:53.170
The baggie probably ripped
when they pulled it out,

15:53.170 --> 15:54.750
and they lost
a few pills.

15:54.750 --> 15:56.540
So that explains what
they were doing up here.

15:56.540 --> 15:58.620
So, what do we do next?

15:58.620 --> 16:01.210
Uh...we dig
into Jeff's past,

16:01.210 --> 16:03.670
find out everybody
he knew.

16:03.670 --> 16:05.500
Two of those people
either killed him
or know who did.

16:05.500 --> 16:06.830
Perfect.

16:06.830 --> 16:08.250
The suspect pool
just shrunk

16:08.250 --> 16:10.620
from the whole world
to about 200 now.

16:10.620 --> 16:13.580
Eliminate women, the very tall,
short, young, old 

16:13.580 --> 16:15.210
we're talking
maybe 50 names.

16:15.210 --> 16:17.210
We could have these guys
ID'd before dinner.

16:19.210 --> 16:21.540
 Good move, pulling me
away from Smitty's RV.

16:21.540 --> 16:23.290
He just dropped the rent
a hundred bucks.

16:23.290 --> 16:25.670
Yeah, my dad always said
the only true negotiating power

16:25.670 --> 16:27.330
is the ability
to walk away.

16:27.330 --> 16:29.290
Smitty's Shangri-La
is where cops go to die.

16:29.290 --> 16:30.670
That's one way
of looking at it.

16:30.670 --> 16:33.000
And the other
is that it's freedom,

16:33.000 --> 16:34.670
model of efficiency.

16:34.670 --> 16:36.250
No commute, cheap rent.

16:36.250 --> 16:37.120
You can spin it
all you want.

16:37.120 --> 16:38.670
Doesn't change the fact

16:38.670 --> 16:40.330
that it's another step
in the wrong direction.

16:40.330 --> 16:42.580
Why not just move back in
with your folks

16:42.580 --> 16:43.710
while you look for
a place?

16:43.710 --> 16:45.830
Talk about
the wrong direction.

16:45.830 --> 16:47.790
'Cause you haven't
told your dad about
your test score?

16:47.790 --> 16:49.830
No.

16:51.500 --> 16:54.000
Alright, fine. Fine.

16:54.000 --> 16:55.580
I'll stay at home tonight,

16:55.580 --> 16:57.290
but only
'cause it'll get Smitty

16:57.290 --> 16:58.830
to knock down the rent
even more.

16:58.830 --> 17:00.580
Just like that,
we're back where we started.

17:00.580 --> 17:02.620
 "Chapter Three.

17:02.620 --> 17:04.500
The healthy habits
of command.

17:04.500 --> 17:06.420
Delegation is the key

17:06.420 --> 17:07.960
to leading men
in times of stress.

17:07.960 --> 17:10.290
Don't ever think you can carry
the load all by yourself."

17:10.290 --> 17:12.750
That is so true.
Don't you think?

17:12.750 --> 17:14.750
It's hard enough to listen to it
without you editorializing.

17:14.750 --> 17:16.920
Hey, I'm happy to stop reading
and catch up on paperwork.

17:16.920 --> 17:18.670
You're gonna have
to re-read all of this anyway

17:18.670 --> 17:20.329
to really memorize it.
No.

17:20.329 --> 17:21.880
I memorize best
when I hear it.

17:21.880 --> 17:23.540
Really?

17:23.540 --> 17:25.000
Yeah.
Huh.

17:25.000 --> 17:26.579
Why?
Nothing. I...

17:26.579 --> 17:28.250
Boot.

17:28.250 --> 17:30.670
You might have
a learning difference.

17:30.670 --> 17:32.420
A what?

17:32.420 --> 17:35.330
Technically, it's classified
as a disability,

17:35.330 --> 17:37.040
but it really just means
that you're wired

17:37.040 --> 17:38.460
to process information
differently.

17:38.460 --> 17:40.920
In your case, through 
through hearing

17:40.920 --> 17:42.330
rather than reading.
I don't have
a learning disability.

17:42.330 --> 17:44.380
A lot of people have them.

17:44.380 --> 17:45.790
I bet Isabel helped you
in the Academy,

17:45.790 --> 17:47.540
read through the materials
with you and stuff.

17:47.540 --> 17:49.580
We're not talking
about this.

17:49.580 --> 17:51.540
 7-Adam-19,
suspicious person.

17:51.540 --> 17:53.710
Unknown male sitting
in a red minivan.

17:53.710 --> 17:56.330
Possibly casing
at 1966 Keegan Street.

17:56.330 --> 17:58.750
7-Adam-19,
show us responding.

17:58.750 --> 18:00.080
All I'm saying is...

18:02.330 --> 18:03.580
Never mind.

18:18.670 --> 18:20.540
Let's talk
on the sidewalk.

18:25.000 --> 18:26.500
Rex?

18:26.500 --> 18:28.080
You're still
chasing bounty?

18:28.080 --> 18:29.420
I thought
you moved to Reno.

18:29.420 --> 18:31.500
All my bail jumpers
come to L.A.

18:31.500 --> 18:33.040
I got a tip one of 'em's
down the street

18:33.040 --> 18:34.540
staying at
his aunt's place.

18:34.540 --> 18:36.620
We got three 911 calls
about a weirdo in a minivan.

18:36.620 --> 18:39.170
Casing.
Watch your tone,
Boot.

18:39.170 --> 18:40.880
Oh, you don't get
to call her "Boot," Rex.

18:40.880 --> 18:42.170
You're retired.

18:42.170 --> 18:43.420
She's the police now.

18:43.420 --> 18:44.790
Let's see
your bail bonds license

18:44.790 --> 18:46.250
and the warrant
on your jumper.

18:46.250 --> 18:48.000
You let her talk to you
like that?

18:55.620 --> 18:57.620
Nico Sandoval.
Attempted murder?

18:57.620 --> 18:59.080
Okay, you need
to call dispatch

18:59.080 --> 18:59.920
and let us know
when you're out here.

18:59.920 --> 19:01.290
This guy sounds dangerous.

19:01.290 --> 19:03.380
Uh, I've been Code 5
on dangerous men

19:03.380 --> 19:05.330
since before you were born,
little lady.

19:05.330 --> 19:06.880
Well, in this century,
you notify local law enforcement

19:06.880 --> 19:09.500
so when you get in the weeds,
we know who's out here.

19:09.500 --> 19:12.120
I don't call for help.
Help calls for me.

19:12.120 --> 19:14.120
Maybe you need to let this guy
read your book.

19:14.120 --> 19:15.880
Rex, if you're gonna
be out here, you gotta
play by the rules.

19:15.880 --> 19:16.830
Ah, come on, Tim.

19:16.830 --> 19:18.210
I call this in,

19:18.210 --> 19:19.670
someone's gonna
snatch my bounty.

19:24.000 --> 19:25.080
I need that money.

19:28.290 --> 19:30.750
Nico shows,
you give us a call.

19:30.750 --> 19:33.580
No one's gonna
"snatch your bounty."

19:33.580 --> 19:35.170
Alright.

19:36.960 --> 19:38.420
It's good to see you,
Rex.

19:38.420 --> 19:40.000
It's good seeing you, too,
Tim.

19:40.000 --> 19:41.420
 Detective Armstrong.

19:41.420 --> 19:44.460
I spoke to some
of Jeff's friends.

19:44.460 --> 19:47.460
Turns out he did a stint
in rehab three months ago.

19:47.460 --> 19:49.000
Wow.

19:49.000 --> 19:51.120
Funny how his family
failed to mention that,

19:51.120 --> 19:54.170
and that explains the fluid
you saw coming out of his mouth.

19:54.170 --> 19:56.500
The only cause for that
to happen in a dead body

19:56.500 --> 19:59.250
is a bad chest cold
or an opioid addiction.

19:59.250 --> 20:00.830
That's good to know.

20:00.830 --> 20:02.960
We need to get a warrant
for Jeff's rehab records,

20:02.960 --> 20:05.250
see if he made
any friends in there.

20:05.250 --> 20:07.330
Actually, I spoke
to an ex-girlfriend.

20:07.330 --> 20:08.710
She told me
while Jeff was in rehab,

20:08.710 --> 20:10.250
he connected with a man
who was, quote,

20:10.250 --> 20:12.460
"ass cancer
in a skin suit."

20:12.460 --> 20:13.920
Got Jeff to deal
some drugs for him

20:13.920 --> 20:15.290
while he was
in his fancy prep school.

20:15.290 --> 20:16.830
This skin suit
have a name?

20:16.830 --> 20:18.290
Bruno Winch.

20:18.290 --> 20:19.330
He lives over
in Highland Park.

20:25.750 --> 20:26.880
 LAPD!
Probation search!

20:26.880 --> 20:28.120
Open up!

20:30.790 --> 20:33.330
-Bruno Winch! LAPD!
-Clear!

20:37.580 --> 20:38.540
-Clear!
-Clear.

20:40.040 --> 20:41.000
Clear!

20:48.710 --> 20:50.120
 Clear.

20:53.830 --> 20:56.040
 Baseball bat.
Tough way to go.

20:56.040 --> 20:59.500
White shoes,
red triangles.

21:12.710 --> 21:14.170
 I don't see you
in 20 years,

21:14.170 --> 21:15.250
now I see you twice
in one day.

21:15.250 --> 21:16.920
I still cannot believe
you're a cop.

21:16.920 --> 21:18.120
How long
have you been in L.A.?

21:18.120 --> 21:20.040
Uh, less than a year.

21:20.040 --> 21:21.710
Moved out after
Sarah and I got divorced

21:21.710 --> 21:22.670
and Henry went off
to college.

21:22.670 --> 21:24.330
That's right.

21:24.330 --> 21:26.540
Yeah, Henry would be, um,
20 now.

21:26.540 --> 21:28.120
20.

21:28.120 --> 21:30.290
That's so weird.
We're so old.

21:30.290 --> 21:32.120
Right. And yet,
you look exactly the same.

21:32.120 --> 21:33.540
How is that
even possible?

21:33.540 --> 21:36.250
Grace.
Did Bruno make it?

21:36.250 --> 21:38.620
He's critical,
but I think he'll live.

21:38.620 --> 21:40.120
He's in ICU.
Any chance
for an interview?

21:40.120 --> 21:42.170
No, we had
to induce a coma.

21:42.170 --> 21:44.170
There's a lot of pressure
on his brain.
Couple days, maybe?

21:44.170 --> 21:45.710
Most likely,
it's gonna be a week.

21:45.710 --> 21:47.330
But we bagged his clothing
for you.

21:47.330 --> 21:48.880
Excuse me.

21:50.710 --> 21:54.330
Yeah, see,
I didn't feel anything then.

21:54.330 --> 21:56.330
Yeah, maybe
I'm just making it up.

21:56.330 --> 21:59.210
Now I think you're just
giving me a hard time.
Absolutely possible.

21:59.210 --> 22:01.790
So, what are we thinking
with Bruno?

22:01.790 --> 22:03.580
He and his partner

22:03.580 --> 22:05.580
pull a home invasion
to get to Jeff.

22:05.580 --> 22:08.330
Jeff probably
stole something from him 

22:08.330 --> 22:10.670
maybe owed him drugs,
money.

22:10.670 --> 22:12.790
But then how does Bruno
end up beaten half to death?

22:12.790 --> 22:14.420
Don't do that 
speculate.

22:14.420 --> 22:16.040
Making up stories is how
innocent men to go jail

22:16.040 --> 22:17.420
and guilty men go free.

22:17.420 --> 22:19.830
Thus endeth the tip.
Understood.

22:19.830 --> 22:21.830
Alright. End of shift.
Uh, you riding
back to the station?

22:21.830 --> 22:23.830
Oh, no, I don't have
to clock out like you do.

22:23.830 --> 22:26.420
I'm gonna stay here, have some
questionable hospital food,

22:26.420 --> 22:28.540
see if a miracle happens
and Bruno wakes up.

22:28.540 --> 22:29.920
Okay. Later.

22:29.920 --> 22:31.210
Later.

22:39.580 --> 22:42.620
Armstrong?

22:42.620 --> 22:45.380
I'm doing a huge renovation
on a house I just bought.

22:45.380 --> 22:47.830
I could really use
an extra set of hands.

22:47.830 --> 22:51.040
Pizza and beer on me.

22:54.380 --> 22:56.170
Pizza and beer?

22:56.170 --> 22:58.380
This place is a wreck.
Yes.

22:58.380 --> 23:00.120
But it's my wreck.

23:01.500 --> 23:03.120
So, hey,
tell me about Grace.

23:03.120 --> 23:05.540
Uh...we dated.

23:05.540 --> 23:07.170
Yeah, I knew it.

23:07.170 --> 23:09.460
She had that "bad breakup"
energy.

23:09.460 --> 23:12.460
It was 20 years ago,
and she's wearing a ring,

23:12.460 --> 23:13.960
probably has a kid.

23:13.960 --> 23:15.330
I'm sure
she barely remembers me.

23:15.330 --> 23:17.540
Yeah, yeah.
Just tell me what happened.

23:17.540 --> 23:20.290
We met my junior year.

23:20.290 --> 23:23.170
I was...dating my ex-wife,
Sarah, since high school,

23:23.170 --> 23:25.880
and, uh, we hit a bad spell
and broke up.

23:25.880 --> 23:27.500
And that's
when Grace happened.

23:27.500 --> 23:29.330
Yeah, we'd been friends
for a few months,

23:29.330 --> 23:31.000
and there had always
been a spark,

23:31.000 --> 23:32.790
but it just...

23:32.790 --> 23:35.380
went off like a bomb.

23:35.380 --> 23:37.460
Crawled all over each other
for two weeks.

23:37.460 --> 23:40.920
It was zero to 160
in the span of a heartbeat.

23:40.920 --> 23:43.080
And then?

23:43.080 --> 23:45.710
Then Sarah showed up at my dorm
eight weeks' pregnant.

23:45.710 --> 23:48.920
Damn. Damn.

23:48.920 --> 23:50.330
And you did
the right thing?

23:50.330 --> 23:51.670
There was really
no other choice.

23:51.670 --> 23:53.210
I still loved her,
and that was my kid.

23:53.210 --> 23:55.830
So, I, uh,
dropped out of school,

23:55.830 --> 23:58.920
packed up my things,
moved back to Foxburg.

23:58.920 --> 24:02.420
I was married in a month,
a dad within six,

24:02.420 --> 24:04.210
got a job in construction,
never looked back.

24:04.210 --> 24:06.540
Never?

24:06.540 --> 24:09.380
Well...I mean,
not never.

24:09.380 --> 24:11.290
Now your paths
have crossed again, so...

24:11.290 --> 24:12.750
So, nothing.

24:12.750 --> 24:14.580
I'm seeing someone,
and she's married.

24:14.580 --> 24:17.420
Married women
are the best.

24:17.420 --> 24:18.790
You find yourself

24:18.790 --> 24:20.670
a sexually frustrated,
hot little mama

24:20.670 --> 24:22.540
whose husband
isn't doing it right 
I can't do that.

24:22.540 --> 24:24.210
I mean, just thinking about that
stresses me out.

24:24.210 --> 24:26.750
That's  That's how
lives are ruined.

24:29.790 --> 24:33.380
That...
is the right answer.

24:34.830 --> 24:36.790
Hey, you can't be faithful
to a girl,

24:36.790 --> 24:39.580
you can't be faithful
to an oath or a badge.

24:39.580 --> 24:40.960
I'll drink to that.
Yes.

24:40.960 --> 24:42.960
 Running late?

24:42.960 --> 24:45.170
Yeah, had to commute from
my folks' place in Simi Valley.

24:45.170 --> 24:46.580
Half the LAPD
lives in Ventura County,

24:46.580 --> 24:48.330
but they all seem
to make it to work on time.

24:48.330 --> 24:50.000
Yeah, well,
my dad was getting

24:50.000 --> 24:52.210
all up in my business
about getting extended.

24:52.210 --> 24:54.250
Literally had to stop him
from coming down here
and lighting up Lopez.

24:54.250 --> 24:56.210
Look, the hole you're in
has nothing to do with Lopez.

24:56.210 --> 24:57.210
But she's gonna
pay the price

24:57.210 --> 24:58.750
when the commander's son
goes belly-up

24:58.750 --> 25:00.000
halfway
through training.

25:00.000 --> 25:01.500
I told him
it's not her fault.

25:01.500 --> 25:02.880
Yeah, so,
tell him again.

25:02.880 --> 25:04.880
Lopez bent over backwards
for you.

25:04.880 --> 25:06.580
She protected your ass

25:06.580 --> 25:08.670
when any other T.O.
would've sent you packing.

25:08.670 --> 25:10.830
You owe her your career.

25:10.830 --> 25:13.250
I know.

25:21.210 --> 25:23.170
 Hey.

25:23.170 --> 25:25.250
You're the cop who wrestled
the guy in the kilt.

25:25.250 --> 25:27.290
Yes. Actually, I'm here
checking on another patient.

25:27.290 --> 25:28.920
Bruno Winch?
We're trying to I.D. his p

25:28.920 --> 25:30.120
Bruno's still in a coma.

25:30.120 --> 25:32.540
Right.
I figured...as much.

25:32.540 --> 25:34.250
I just thought
I'd come and check.

25:34.250 --> 25:37.420
You could have
done that by phone.

25:37.420 --> 25:39.040
 See ya.

25:40.580 --> 25:43.250
I officially feel like
you're stalking me.

25:43.250 --> 25:45.580
That is as ridiculous
as it is accurate.

25:45.580 --> 25:47.920
We really just
didn't get a chance
to catch up yesterday.

25:47.920 --> 25:49.500
Like, how long have
you been working here?

25:49.500 --> 25:52.380
And, uh,
do you have any kids?

25:54.080 --> 25:55.620
I've been here three weeks,

25:55.620 --> 25:58.210
I'm the new head
of emergency medicine,

25:58.210 --> 25:59.710
and I have
an 8-year-old.

25:59.710 --> 26:01.460
Oh,
8's such a great age,

26:01.460 --> 26:03.290
I mean, obviously,
they're all great, but 8 is...

26:03.290 --> 26:06.830
John, listen 
I don't mean to be rude.

26:06.830 --> 26:09.380
I can't do this
with you.

26:09.380 --> 26:11.040
Grace,
it's been 20 years.

26:11.040 --> 26:12.380
You left a note
on my door.

26:12.380 --> 26:13.790
I mean, I never heard
from you again.

26:13.790 --> 26:16.580
Sarah was pregnant.

26:16.580 --> 26:18.380
You broke my heart.

26:18.380 --> 26:20.710
I mean, I thought that
we were both in love,

26:20.710 --> 26:22.250
and then you just
disappeared.

26:24.330 --> 26:26.750
I can't believe that I am still
this angry with you.
Grace 

26:26.750 --> 26:28.580
You know,
I'll have them call you

26:28.580 --> 26:30.330
when your suspect
wakes up.

26:45.330 --> 26:47.330
 Mr. Christian?

26:47.330 --> 26:48.750
Can I help you
with something?

26:48.750 --> 26:50.920
Uh, Detective Armstrong
asked me to come in

26:50.920 --> 26:52.620
so he could re-interview me

26:52.620 --> 26:56.290
after, you know,
the initial shock's passed.

26:56.290 --> 26:58.080
But I'm not sure it has.

27:00.580 --> 27:03.000
I can only imagine what you're
going through right now.

27:04.880 --> 27:07.000
Hell, if somebody hurt my Henry,
I'd be out for blood.

27:13.460 --> 27:15.000
I'll go let Detective Armstrong
know that you're here.

27:19.670 --> 27:21.670
Armstrong.
Yeah.
What's up, buddy?

27:21.670 --> 27:23.250
I was just talking

27:23.250 --> 27:24.540
to Matt Christian
in the lobby.
Mm-hmm?

27:24.540 --> 27:27.210
I told him if anything
happened to my son,

27:27.210 --> 27:29.790
I'd be out for blood,
and he just got his look.

27:31.460 --> 27:33.620
I mean, I-I could be
misinterpreting it.

27:33.620 --> 27:36.040
Our job as investigators
is not to speculate.

27:36.040 --> 27:37.620
It's to think about
what we've seen,

27:37.620 --> 27:40.790
what we've heard,
and articulate the facts.

27:40.790 --> 27:42.580
What are those facts?

27:42.580 --> 27:46.000
Matt paid for Jeff
to go to rehab.

27:46.000 --> 27:48.580
Uh, that's where
Jeff met Bruno.

27:48.580 --> 27:50.620
Yep.

27:50.620 --> 27:52.170
It's definitely possible

27:52.170 --> 27:54.250
that Matt met Bruno there

27:54.250 --> 27:55.540
when he was
visiting his son.

27:55.540 --> 27:57.960
Maybe Matt recognized
Bruno's voice

27:57.960 --> 27:59.210
during the home invasion?

28:01.750 --> 28:03.380
Let's go talk to Matt.

28:03.380 --> 28:05.250
 Alright.
Thanks for coming by, Matt.

28:05.250 --> 28:06.540
How's Marilyn today?

28:06.540 --> 28:07.920
We didn't sleep.

28:07.920 --> 28:11.120
She, uh 
She can't stop crying.

28:11.120 --> 28:13.380
Yeah, I'm sorry.

28:13.380 --> 28:15.170
I only have
a few follow-up questions,

28:15.170 --> 28:16.830
and then we'll get you
back to her, okay?

28:16.830 --> 28:18.540
Yeah.

28:18.540 --> 28:19.670
Alright, was Jeff
on pain medication?

28:19.670 --> 28:21.500
We found oxy in his room.

28:21.500 --> 28:24.250
He tore his knee
last year.

28:24.250 --> 28:26.330
Eh  Doctor gave him
a couple of pills.

28:26.330 --> 28:27.750
He was hooked
for a little while,

28:27.750 --> 28:30.040
but...I got him clean.

28:30.040 --> 28:31.880
Re-birth Malibu.
That's right.

28:31.880 --> 28:33.460
They straightened him
right out.

28:33.460 --> 28:35.250
Did you ever
visit him there?
Of course.

28:35.250 --> 28:36.750
You know,
when they let me.

28:36.750 --> 28:39.880
Did you meet a patient
named Bruno Winch?

28:42.880 --> 28:44.540
Doesn't ring a bell.

28:46.750 --> 28:49.040
But what's this got to do
with the home invasion?

28:49.040 --> 28:51.330
That...wasn't about Jeff.

28:51.330 --> 28:54.170
Well...actually, we think
he was the real target.

28:57.120 --> 28:59.120
What are you
talking about?

28:59.120 --> 29:01.420
Bruno Winch is one of the men
that entered your home,

29:01.420 --> 29:03.380
bound and beat you,
and killed your son.

29:05.540 --> 29:07.580
I have a photo of him.
Maybe you recognize him.

29:09.580 --> 29:12.170
Oops.
Uh, that's the wrong photo.

29:12.170 --> 29:14.210
That's what he looked
like yesterday when
we found him, so...

29:14.210 --> 29:15.580
Is he dead?
No.

29:15.580 --> 29:16.960
He's just in the hospital.

29:16.960 --> 29:18.380
We're waiting for him
to wake up

29:18.380 --> 29:19.750
so he can tell us
who did that to him.

29:19.750 --> 29:21.000
I don't actually
have the photo with me.

29:21.000 --> 29:22.580
Uh...let me go get it.

29:24.080 --> 29:25.750
Uh, Matt,
why didn't you mention

29:25.750 --> 29:27.210
that Jeff
had a drug problem?

29:30.420 --> 29:33.290
Wasn't a problem anymore.

29:33.290 --> 29:35.580
And I didn't want his
whole memory to be that.

29:35.580 --> 29:37.830
Of course.
Well, that's a father's job 

29:37.830 --> 29:39.880
protect his kids.

29:39.880 --> 29:42.330
He was
the best part of me.

29:42.330 --> 29:44.170
I failed him.

29:45.420 --> 29:47.750
Matt,
I know you feel guilty.

29:47.750 --> 29:49.290
Put him in rehab
to straighten him out,

29:49.290 --> 29:51.040
watch him get connected
with bad people

29:51.040 --> 29:52.290
who just pulled him
deeper down,

29:52.290 --> 29:53.830
but that is not
your fault.

29:53.830 --> 29:55.330
If you know anything

29:55.330 --> 29:57.750
that can lead us
to Bruno's partner,

29:57.750 --> 29:59.540
you need to tell me.

29:59.540 --> 30:01.750
Just let us do our job.

30:11.420 --> 30:13.920
Sorry.
Printer's broken.

30:13.920 --> 30:15.420
Uh, I can e-mail you
the photo.

30:15.420 --> 30:17.000
Sure.

30:17.000 --> 30:21.580
Uh...I really have
to get back to my wife.

30:21.580 --> 30:23.420
O-Of course.
Of  Of course. Come 

30:23.420 --> 30:26.000
Uh, we'll be in touch.
Soon.

30:26.000 --> 30:27.750
Thank you.

30:31.540 --> 30:32.750
So, what do you think?

30:32.750 --> 30:34.420
He's out for revenge.

30:34.420 --> 30:35.710
We get a surveillance team
on him?

30:35.710 --> 30:37.210
If he knows who Bruno is,

30:37.210 --> 30:38.380
it's likely he knows
who Bruno's partner is,

30:38.380 --> 30:39.620
and he'll
go after him next.

30:39.620 --> 30:41.210
Which is why
when I stepped out,

30:41.210 --> 30:43.120
I had SIS put a tracker
on Matt's car.

30:43.120 --> 30:44.290
Airship will follow.

30:44.290 --> 30:46.210
While we hunt down
the partner.

30:46.210 --> 30:47.790
While we hunt down
the partner.

30:47.790 --> 30:49.120
 You doing okay?

30:49.120 --> 30:50.500
 Fine.

30:50.500 --> 30:52.000
I know
what's bothering you.

30:52.000 --> 30:53.500
Seven Year Glitch.

30:53.500 --> 30:55.420
Sorry. Seven Year what?
Glitch.

30:55.420 --> 30:57.080
The most dangerous time
for a cop

30:57.080 --> 30:59.960
happens every seven years,
like clockwork.

30:59.960 --> 31:01.620
It's when most of us
lose the passion,

31:01.620 --> 31:03.290
grow complacent,
disillusioned.

31:03.290 --> 31:04.670
I went through it myself.

31:04.670 --> 31:06.460
Okay, well...I mean,

31:06.460 --> 31:08.250
I've only been on
for six months.

31:08.250 --> 31:10.330
You're not
a regular rookie.

31:10.330 --> 31:12.290
You've been gung-ho
since you were a kid.

31:12.290 --> 31:14.000
And now
you're glitching early.

31:16.290 --> 31:18.750
Okay, well,
h-how do I fix my glitch?

31:18.750 --> 31:20.380
How'd you fix yours?

31:20.380 --> 31:22.670
I became a T.O.

31:22.670 --> 31:25.040
Changed my routine.
Challenged myself.

31:25.040 --> 31:27.040
Well,
I am challenging myself.

31:27.040 --> 31:29.000
Me not being all in,
all the time,

31:29.000 --> 31:30.460
is me changing
my routine.

31:32.670 --> 31:34.500
But...you know, I can 

31:34.500 --> 31:38.330
I can put all that on hold
for six more months,

31:38.330 --> 31:40.500
embrace my inner slacker
after you're free of me.

31:40.500 --> 31:42.500
I'm not asking you that 
I know.

31:42.500 --> 31:44.040
But it's the right thing.

31:46.040 --> 31:47.670
Do you want me
to read to you?

31:47.670 --> 31:48.790
No.
Come on.

31:48.790 --> 31:50.500
You have to learn it.

31:50.500 --> 31:51.620
I can do that on my own.

31:55.460 --> 31:56.880
What are we doing back here?

31:56.880 --> 31:58.460
I checked the computer.

31:58.460 --> 32:00.120
Rex didn't bring in his bounty
last night,

32:00.120 --> 32:01.750
which means he's
been out here this whole time.

32:01.750 --> 32:03.380
So this is
a welfare check?

32:03.380 --> 32:04.750
Oh, don't put it to him
like that.

32:11.880 --> 32:13.880
7-Adam-19,
got a broken car window,

32:13.880 --> 32:15.080
missing driver.

32:15.080 --> 32:16.380
Send backup
to my location.

32:23.120 --> 32:24.750
 Rex.

32:24.750 --> 32:27.420
Eh, that little punk
hit me with a cheap shot.

32:27.420 --> 32:30.620
 7-Adam-19, we need
an RA to 1966 Keegan.

32:30.620 --> 32:33.250
Assault victim. Broken arm,
possible concussion.
Where'd he go?

32:33.250 --> 32:35.960
His aunt's house.
He's long gone by now, though.

32:35.960 --> 32:38.500
We need a warrant,
or backup.

32:38.500 --> 32:40.000
Sit down.
No, go 

32:40.000 --> 32:42.960
Go, go! Go with him.
I'm fine. Go!

32:42.960 --> 32:46.000
Tony Craig!
That's Bruno's partner.

32:46.000 --> 32:48.290
He's all over
Bruno's cellphone.

32:48.290 --> 32:50.290
They even texted about
the home invasion.

32:50.290 --> 32:51.960
Apartment's
in Century City.

32:52.620 --> 32:54.290
Matt Christian's in the wind.

32:54.290 --> 32:56.330
I thought there was a tracker
on his car.

32:56.330 --> 32:58.250
He ditched it at the mall.
Disappeared.

32:58.250 --> 33:00.500
Which mall?
Century City.

33:00.500 --> 33:01.960
He's going after Tony.

33:06.210 --> 33:09.210
 Nico. Where is he?
I don't know.
He isn't here.

33:09.210 --> 33:10.170
There's blood
on your front door.

33:10.170 --> 33:11.790
That's exigent circumstances,

33:11.790 --> 33:12.880
so I'm not leaving
till you tell me where he is.

33:12.880 --> 33:13.960
He isn't here!

33:13.960 --> 33:15.460
So, you're gonna call him.

33:15.460 --> 33:16.960
Otherwise
we're gonna book you

33:16.960 --> 33:18.040
for aiding and abetting
a fugitive.

33:18.040 --> 33:19.380
Do it now.

33:28.670 --> 33:30.250
  Hey.
What's up?

33:30.250 --> 33:32.250
Cops are here.
Where are you?

33:32.250 --> 33:33.580
I'm in Florida.

33:35.250 --> 33:36.620
 Nico Sandoval!

33:36.620 --> 33:38.170
You got five seconds
to surrender!

33:38.170 --> 33:40.250
I'm in Florida, yo.

33:48.920 --> 33:50.620
You guys want
some of this?

34:21.170 --> 34:23.830
Michelle!
Bail me out, okay?

34:23.830 --> 34:25.250
 You're coming, too.
Let's go.
What?!

34:25.250 --> 34:26.330
Right now.

34:29.670 --> 34:32.040
Tony's gate is open.

34:42.670 --> 34:44.330
Clear.

34:57.420 --> 34:58.500
Clear.

35:03.620 --> 35:05.620
Matt got here before us.

35:05.620 --> 35:07.380
He must have knew
we were right behind him,

35:07.380 --> 35:09.580
took Tony someplace
to finish him off.

35:09.580 --> 35:11.040
Yeah. But where?

35:11.040 --> 35:12.830
 Mrs. Christian,

35:12.830 --> 35:14.380
I know you think
you're protecting him,

35:14.380 --> 35:17.420
but what your husband
is doing is wrong.

35:17.420 --> 35:20.790
Look, m-ma'am,

35:20.790 --> 35:23.710
right now, you can't see
beyond this moment.

35:23.710 --> 35:25.120
Neither can your husband.

35:25.120 --> 35:27.210
Making those men pay
for what they did

35:27.210 --> 35:28.620
is all he cares about.

35:28.620 --> 35:31.250
I, uh...

35:31.250 --> 35:35.330
I know just...a little
about what it's like

35:35.330 --> 35:38.120
to be obsessed with something

35:38.120 --> 35:40.250
at the expense
of everything else.

35:40.250 --> 35:43.960
And trust me, it will not
change the way you feel.

35:46.960 --> 35:48.710
Look, your son is gone,

35:48.710 --> 35:51.790
and what your husband is doing
will destroy both of you.

35:51.790 --> 35:53.460
I know it's too late
to save Jeff,

35:53.460 --> 35:56.790
but if you can tell us
where Matt is...

35:56.790 --> 35:58.120
you might not
lose your husband.

36:14.750 --> 36:16.080
Matt!

36:18.620 --> 36:19.790
What did you do with Tony?

36:19.790 --> 36:21.210
What he deserved.

36:22.460 --> 36:24.000
And now it's over...

36:24.000 --> 36:25.750
or it's gonna be soon.

36:35.000 --> 36:36.210
The cement.

36:38.330 --> 36:40.120
Matt put Tony
in the cement.

36:40.120 --> 36:41.830
That criminal
killed my boy.

36:42.880 --> 36:44.920
I know,
and he's gonna pay, okay?

36:44.920 --> 36:46.380
So, you don't
have to do this.

36:46.380 --> 36:47.670
You can just come on down.

36:54.620 --> 36:55.580
You don't get it.

36:57.210 --> 37:00.500
I died in that bedroom
alongside my son.

37:00.500 --> 37:05.250
The only thing keeping me alive
was killing them,

37:05.250 --> 37:06.500
and now that's over.

37:09.580 --> 37:11.210
 Hey, Nolan!

37:11.210 --> 37:13.120
Look, I found him,
but I can't get him up.

37:13.120 --> 37:14.960
Help me!

37:14.960 --> 37:16.790
We can only save one guy,

37:16.790 --> 37:19.920
and right now,
Tony is the victim!

37:22.460 --> 37:25.790
Matt, I know this seems
hopeless right now,

37:25.790 --> 37:27.830
but don't make your wife
bury two bodies.

37:27.830 --> 37:29.250
It will destroy her.

37:29.250 --> 37:31.540
Nolan! Help me!

37:44.710 --> 37:45.920
Come here.

37:45.920 --> 37:47.670
Come on!

37:54.000 --> 37:55.120
Watch yourself.

38:00.080 --> 38:02.000
ABCs. Go.

38:04.330 --> 38:06.290
-There we go.

38:06.290 --> 38:08.540
We saved him.

38:24.420 --> 38:26.080
 Training for
the rematch with Nico?

38:28.380 --> 38:30.500
Ah,
we got him in the end.

38:32.500 --> 38:33.920
Here.

38:33.920 --> 38:36.250
What's this?

38:36.250 --> 38:38.420
It is
"Split Second Leadership:

38:38.420 --> 38:39.750
Leading Men
In The Line of Duty,"

38:39.750 --> 38:41.170
the audio book.

38:41.170 --> 38:42.960
This book's out of print.

38:42.960 --> 38:44.830
There's no audio book.

38:44.830 --> 38:47.380
Yeah, which is why
I recorded one for you.

38:47.380 --> 38:48.830
Uh, listen,
I-I talked to Isabel,

38:48.830 --> 38:50.420
and from what she said,

38:50.420 --> 38:52.000
it's clear you're
a kinesthetic learner,

38:52.000 --> 38:53.960
which just means that
you need to listen

38:53.960 --> 38:56.250
while you're being active
in order to absorb things.

38:56.250 --> 38:59.420
There's no shame in it.
Really.

38:59.420 --> 39:03.460
Honestly, it's probably why
you excel at being a cop.

39:04.830 --> 39:07.420
Uh...I'll see you tomorrow.

39:07.420 --> 39:08.710
Yeah.

39:12.500 --> 39:14.540
Thanks.

39:22.920 --> 39:25.290
 "Split Second Leadership"
by Curtis Philbrick,

39:25.290 --> 39:27.000
read by the best rookie
you've ever trained.

39:32.290 --> 39:34.540
Hey, headed home?
Yeah.

39:34.540 --> 39:36.040
You live alone, right?

39:36.040 --> 39:37.920
Yeah. First time ever.
No roommates.

39:37.920 --> 39:40.040
It's heaven. Why?

39:58.460 --> 40:00.000
Well, welcome aboard.

40:00.000 --> 40:01.790
Women's softball's on ESPN,

40:01.790 --> 40:03.790
and I just made
a pitcher of mojitos.

40:03.790 --> 40:05.210
Come on in.

40:09.750 --> 40:12.080
-Yeah, nice!

40:14.080 --> 40:15.670
 Nope.

40:22.920 --> 40:24.920
 Hey.

40:24.920 --> 40:28.080
I talked to Lopez, and she said
you needed a place to live

40:28.080 --> 40:31.040
and a kickass roommate
to help you find some balance.

40:31.040 --> 40:32.420
Thank God.
Thank you.

40:36.330 --> 40:37.920
Yeah. Come on. Come on.
Let's go.

40:37.920 --> 40:39.170
Let's get out of here.

40:45.330 --> 40:47.120
Good Lord, don't you have
someplace better to be?

40:47.120 --> 40:48.750
It's nice to see you,
too.

40:48.750 --> 40:51.880
Hey...thanks.

40:51.880 --> 40:54.460
Look, I put the paperwork
through under your name.

40:54.460 --> 40:57.460
So, you're gonna get
the bounty on Nico.

40:57.460 --> 40:59.250
Thank you.

41:03.790 --> 41:05.750
I...I know you're
not the kind of guy
that asks for help,

41:05.750 --> 41:07.580
but if you ever find yourself
out here again,

41:07.580 --> 41:09.420
just give me a heads up.

41:09.420 --> 41:11.920
Little professional courtesy,
right?

41:11.920 --> 41:13.540
Exactly. Alright.

41:13.540 --> 41:14.750
Thanks, brother.

41:14.750 --> 41:15.920
Alright.
You take care.

41:24.120 --> 41:25.330
Hey.

41:25.330 --> 41:26.670
It's been a long day,
John.

41:26.670 --> 41:28.210
No, I know. Of course.

41:28.210 --> 41:30.000
And I'll only take
a moment of your time.

41:30.000 --> 41:32.290
Look, I left you a note

41:32.290 --> 41:34.080
because I wouldn't have been
able to go through with it

41:34.080 --> 41:35.460
if I saw you in person.

41:37.250 --> 41:39.790
And I don't regret
marrying Sarah,

41:39.790 --> 41:42.960
and I have loved every minute
of being Henry's dad.

41:42.960 --> 41:45.960
But what I did to you
was selfish,

41:45.960 --> 41:47.330
and you deserve better,
and I'm sorry.

41:58.670 --> 42:00.380
Thank you.

42:01.830 --> 42:03.920
Thank you.

42:06.920 --> 42:09.880
So...now that
we're friends again,

42:09.880 --> 42:11.710
it hurts when I do this.

42:12.305 --> 42:18.477
