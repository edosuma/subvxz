WEBVTT

02:12.350 --> 02:14.318
They're all gonna miss you.

02:14.352 --> 02:19.625
So I mean, everybody kind of
expects that, you know.

02:19.658 --> 02:20.935
Honestly, it was just
really awkward,

02:20.959 --> 02:25.631
like, being around
everyone because...

02:25.664 --> 02:28.266
you know how it is, yeah.

02:28.299 --> 02:30.636
It's going to be okay though.

03:03.401 --> 03:05.536
I'm surprised you
aren't more excited.

03:05.571 --> 03:07.338
It's your last year.

03:07.371 --> 03:09.808
All new classes and teachers

03:09.842 --> 03:13.411
and you get to see your friends.

03:16.849 --> 03:19.985
What's the matter?

03:20.018 --> 03:22.520
Should I get you
a new game after work?

03:22.554 --> 03:25.691
Is there one you want?

03:25.724 --> 03:29.061
Uh, there's Vigilante Takedown.

03:29.094 --> 03:32.363
- Which?
- Vigilante Takedown...

03:32.396 --> 03:35.768
- for VR.
- Vigilante Takedown VR.

03:35.801 --> 03:37.669
That's the name?

03:37.703 --> 03:39.905
And you promise to
try hard today, right?

03:39.938 --> 03:42.373
Make Daddy proud.

03:42.406 --> 03:44.910
- Deal?
- Mhm.

03:44.943 --> 03:46.544
Good luck.

03:46.578 --> 03:48.981
Bye.

04:06.632 --> 04:08.600
- Justin Phillips?
- Here.

04:08.634 --> 04:09.935
Hi Justin.

04:09.968 --> 04:12.871
- Penelope Lou?
- Here.

04:12.905 --> 04:17.508
Dawei Morrow.

04:17.542 --> 04:19.711
Morrow? Dawei?

04:19.745 --> 04:25.349
Um, wait no,
is it pronounced Dewey?

04:25.383 --> 04:27.986
- It's Edward.
- I'm sorry?

04:28.020 --> 04:32.991
Edward.
My name is Edward Morrow.

04:33.025 --> 04:36.895
Well, it's great to have you
in class, Edward.

04:36.929 --> 04:40.599
Um, Judy Chang.

04:52.744 --> 04:55.747
At least I think so
or I should say hope so.

04:55.781 --> 04:58.684
I'm hoping she's right
because last year was so much

04:58.717 --> 05:02.754
so we'll see I guess but, yeah.

05:07.092 --> 05:09.393
Why is he staring at me?

05:09.427 --> 05:10.796
Coach will you play
you eventually.

05:10.829 --> 05:11.940
- Do you trust me?
- I mean, you have a say

05:11.964 --> 05:13.497
- in that, don't you?
- Hi.

05:13.531 --> 05:15.009
- Hi, how you doing?
- I'm good, how are you?

05:15.033 --> 05:17.401
- Yeah, doing well.
- What'd you do this morning.

05:17.435 --> 05:21.505
- Oh you know, it's good.
- I got a B.

05:21.539 --> 05:24.475
A B? That's good, you got a B.

05:24.508 --> 05:27.478
Hey, what's up Edward.

05:30.749 --> 05:33.785
Hey.

05:33.819 --> 05:37.421
He's so weird, he's so weird.

05:37.455 --> 05:39.825
He looks a little like your ex.

05:57.109 --> 05:58.944
What the hell!

06:38.150 --> 06:39.818
Deep breaths, little man.

06:46.224 --> 06:49.194
I want you to do your best
and just get through the day.

06:49.227 --> 06:53.531
Okay?

06:53.565 --> 06:56.568
Everything is going to be fine.

06:56.601 --> 07:00.005
And I'm always here
if you need me for anything.

07:02.674 --> 07:06.945
I want you to do me a favor,
will yah?

07:06.979 --> 07:13.285
You take care of our garden?

07:13.318 --> 07:17.856
Atta boy, little man, atta boy.

07:21.860 --> 07:25.230
Chili peppers there
in the corner, squash.

07:25.263 --> 07:27.733
- And?
- Raspberries.

07:27.766 --> 07:30.002
How about in Chinese?

07:34.039 --> 07:38.542
Ah, I love you Edward.

07:48.854 --> 07:51.957
Here you go.

07:56.028 --> 07:58.997
Thanks.

08:05.837 --> 08:11.109
It's seen better days right?

08:11.143 --> 08:16.048
He's still here.

08:16.081 --> 08:18.750
We all miss your dad a lot.

08:18.784 --> 08:21.353
He was a really great man.

08:21.386 --> 08:23.355
He would have been so proud
of you, Edward.

09:09.668 --> 09:14.206
Edward?

09:14.239 --> 09:16.975
Edward?

09:25.016 --> 09:27.786
I wish I could just
transfer out of there.

09:27.819 --> 09:32.991
No one at that school values me.

09:33.024 --> 09:36.194
Is this because I'm different?

09:36.228 --> 09:39.030
I'm not like Kevin.

09:39.064 --> 09:42.834
Uh, I don't know why Jessica's
with a guy like that.

09:42.868 --> 09:47.005
Oh, she's this cute girl
in my history class.

09:49.407 --> 09:55.247
Edward.

09:55.280 --> 09:59.885
Who are you talking to?

09:59.918 --> 10:02.254
It's been months since Dad died.

10:02.287 --> 10:05.157
We have to accept it.

10:05.190 --> 10:07.058
You're almost an adult now, huh.

10:07.092 --> 10:08.693
You're starting senior year.

10:08.727 --> 10:10.929
- Hate that school.
- Hate it? You don't hate it.

10:10.962 --> 10:12.931
I hate that school,
everyone's the same.

10:12.964 --> 10:15.133
They're all a bunch of losers
who don't deserve to live

10:15.167 --> 10:16.777
and they just want me to fail
in everything...

10:16.801 --> 10:23.041
- What are you saying?
- I want to transfer.

10:23.074 --> 10:26.044
Your last year?
That doesn't make any sense.

10:26.077 --> 10:28.413
Wait, Edward.

10:28.446 --> 10:31.816
I got you the game you wanted.

10:41.526 --> 10:43.895
Thanks.

11:28.139 --> 11:29.474
What's that?

11:29.507 --> 11:36.047
We're going to fix up
your garden.

11:36.081 --> 11:38.283
That was Michael's hobby.

11:38.316 --> 11:40.051
Not mine.

11:41.952 --> 11:43.996
I wasn't trying to offend you.

11:44.079 --> 11:48.417
I just thought it might be fun for Edward.

11:49.001 --> 11:51.211
I could work on it with him after school.

11:51.253 --> 11:53.130
It would give you a break, too.

12:00.038 --> 12:04.809
Edward, do you want to work on
the garden with Aunt Mei?

12:10.148 --> 12:12.517
Uh.

12:12.551 --> 12:15.987
I guess Dad would like that.

12:26.464 --> 12:29.501
- Like this?
- Uh-huh, dig deep

12:29.534 --> 12:32.904
down to the root and pull.

12:45.050 --> 12:48.520
Valued.

12:48.554 --> 12:50.188
Valued.

12:50.221 --> 12:51.956
Valued.

12:51.990 --> 12:53.858
Valued.

12:53.892 --> 12:55.927
Valued, valued, valued, valued.

12:55.960 --> 12:59.565
- Valued.
- Please stop.

13:02.635 --> 13:06.004
Mom, why'd you call
the store Valued Printing?

13:06.037 --> 13:09.240
It was Dad's idea.

13:09.274 --> 13:10.643
Do you homework, Edward.

13:10.676 --> 13:12.578
We don't want to be behind
in your studies.

13:12.611 --> 13:15.914
I'm done.

13:21.986 --> 13:24.122
What is this?

13:24.155 --> 13:25.658
You need to write more clearly.

13:25.691 --> 13:28.026
If I can't read it
how can your teacher?

13:28.059 --> 13:35.500
Because she's American and
she can speak fluent English.

13:35.533 --> 13:39.337
You do it again
and you make it neater.

13:39.371 --> 13:42.207
- Hello?
- Who cares if it's neat?

13:42.240 --> 13:43.585
It's right,
that's the point, isn't it?

13:43.609 --> 13:45.377
Hush.

13:45.410 --> 13:48.647
Anyone there?

13:53.518 --> 13:57.055
Valued.

13:57.088 --> 13:58.456
Now despite
the United States being

13:58.490 --> 14:00.693
one of the most
diverse countries

14:00.726 --> 14:03.061
there are some
basic democratic values

14:03.094 --> 14:06.498
that we all share as Americans.

14:06.531 --> 14:09.501
Like, freedom of speech,

14:09.534 --> 14:11.604
religion,

14:11.637 --> 14:14.272
freedom of press,

14:14.305 --> 14:16.207
the rule of law.

14:16.241 --> 14:17.719
And we also hold in common
the importance

14:17.743 --> 14:20.278
of individual rights.

14:30.088 --> 14:32.691
What are you doing?

14:32.725 --> 14:36.027
What's going on?

14:36.060 --> 14:38.163
Edward?

14:38.196 --> 14:40.165
Ms. Lee,
can I please move seats?

14:40.198 --> 14:45.036
Fine.

14:45.069 --> 14:48.607
Can we please start
to pay attention?

14:48.641 --> 14:52.210
As I was saying,
individual rights.

14:52.243 --> 14:53.478
Life and liberty.

14:53.511 --> 14:54.713
Property.

14:54.747 --> 14:57.315
The pursuit of happiness.

15:18.102 --> 15:20.505
Ugh.

15:39.725 --> 15:41.459
Did Edward do something wrong?

15:41.493 --> 15:43.027
Edward's been
a little disruptive

15:43.061 --> 15:44.539
to the other students
just on occasion

15:44.563 --> 15:47.800
but no, that's not why
I called you in here today.

15:47.833 --> 15:49.668
Edward's father died
this summer.

15:49.702 --> 15:51.604
Yes, I remember seeing him
at a lot of

15:51.637 --> 15:53.338
the parent teacher conferences

15:53.371 --> 15:57.643
and I am so, so sorry
for your loss, Mrs. Morrow.

15:57.676 --> 15:59.745
That's why I think that Edward

15:59.778 --> 16:03.481
could do with
some extra support.

16:03.515 --> 16:05.483
You know,
sometimes a school consular

16:05.517 --> 16:08.086
or even the best mom
in the world,

16:08.119 --> 16:09.822
it just simply isn't enough.

16:09.855 --> 16:13.291
There's no shame
in seeking professional help.

16:13.324 --> 16:15.360
Nobody should have
to grieve on their own.

16:15.393 --> 16:18.429
Even you might benefit.

16:18.604 --> 16:20.147
Where are you from?

16:22.233 --> 16:23.501
Oh, I'm sorry I...

16:23.567 --> 16:26.278
In Cantonese, if you prefer?

16:29.742 --> 16:33.077
Where are you from?

16:33.111 --> 16:34.479
I'm American, Mrs. Morrow.

16:34.512 --> 16:38.316
I'm sorry,
I don't speak Chinese.

16:38.349 --> 16:40.227
Here's the information
of somebody who the school

16:40.251 --> 16:42.153
routinely recommends,
he specializes

16:42.186 --> 16:43.856
in child psychiatry.

16:43.889 --> 16:45.624
He's local so he works
in the area

16:45.658 --> 16:49.394
and he speaks fluent Chinese.

16:49.427 --> 16:52.230
I will talk to Edward.

17:15.253 --> 17:17.155
I've got your back.

17:40.545 --> 17:43.381
You're valued.

17:43.414 --> 17:45.316
You're valued.

17:49.420 --> 17:50.556
Value.

17:50.589 --> 17:54.158
Round and round, one minus zero.

17:54.192 --> 17:56.194
One minus zero.

17:56.227 --> 17:57.763
Zero has no value.

17:57.796 --> 18:00.298
Zero does not equal zero.

18:00.331 --> 18:01.867
One minus zero.

18:04.535 --> 18:08.907
Round and round like a zero.

18:08.941 --> 18:11.175
Zero can't be a zero.

18:11.209 --> 18:13.646
Can't be a zero.

18:13.679 --> 18:16.749
You've got my back.

18:16.782 --> 18:18.549
You've got my back!

18:18.584 --> 18:20.853
Bird flight becomes possible
thanks to a combination

18:20.886 --> 18:23.254
of lift and thrust.

18:23.287 --> 18:25.724
The wing has an air foil shape
which allows...

18:25.758 --> 18:27.291
Pay attention, little man.

18:27.325 --> 18:29.227
To press down less
than air at the bottom.

18:29.260 --> 18:31.496
Birds rotate their wings
as they flap them

18:31.529 --> 18:34.933
which creates
a forward motion called...

18:34.967 --> 18:36.467
thrust.

18:36.501 --> 18:38.369
Let's take a look.

18:42.507 --> 18:45.510
Behold the wonder if flight.

18:45.543 --> 18:47.846
Have you ever looked up
and marveled

18:47.880 --> 18:50.248
at the majesty
and beauty of birds

18:50.281 --> 18:52.918
flying through the air?

18:52.951 --> 18:54.987
The effortlessness
and simplicity

18:55.020 --> 18:57.956
that we take for granted
is evolutions crowing...

19:03.028 --> 19:05.731
Bats, birds and ancient
dinosaurs,

19:05.764 --> 19:06.999
thousands of species...

19:07.032 --> 19:10.769
Whoever is doing that
please stop.

19:14.773 --> 19:16.742
Hey.

19:26.484 --> 19:28.486
Hey, Edward, get down.

19:28.519 --> 19:30.889
Hey.

19:30.923 --> 19:33.458
Caw, caw!

19:33.491 --> 19:34.727
Stop that now!

19:34.760 --> 19:37.830
Caw, caw.

19:37.863 --> 19:41.033
Hey!

20:38.690 --> 20:39.690
Edward.

20:41.059 --> 20:42.628
Edward.

20:42.661 --> 20:43.896
All right guys.

20:43.929 --> 20:47.866
Put your phone away.

20:47.900 --> 20:49.433
Go back to class.

20:49.467 --> 20:52.805
Go.

20:55.941 --> 20:58.543
I'll need just
a few more minutes.

20:58.577 --> 21:00.646
Edward, can you please wait here
for a moment

21:00.679 --> 21:03.514
while I talk to your mother?

21:14.626 --> 21:17.896
I know this year hasn't been
easy for you, Edward.

21:17.930 --> 21:20.866
I thought maybe
you just needed more time.

21:20.899 --> 21:22.601
But the doctor
said this isn't just about

21:22.634 --> 21:24.870
you missing Daddy.

21:24.903 --> 21:27.139
He says you're sick.

21:27.172 --> 21:28.841
It's not your fault

21:28.874 --> 21:31.442
but it won't go away by itself.

21:31.475 --> 21:33.111
Taking medicine
as soon as possible

21:33.145 --> 21:36.615
would give us the best chance
of feeling better.

21:42.520 --> 21:44.022
What is it?

21:44.056 --> 21:45.991
It will help you think
more clearly,

21:46.024 --> 21:51.495
feel happier,
less nervous all the time.

21:51.529 --> 21:53.031
You start with one.

21:53.065 --> 21:55.466
Then go up to three.

21:55.499 --> 21:58.070
Maybe it will help you
fit in better,

21:58.103 --> 22:01.707
be more like the other kids
at school.

22:01.740 --> 22:06.044
Daddy also took medicine
when he was sick.

22:06.078 --> 22:08.113
If he would've started earlier

22:08.146 --> 22:11.583
maybe he would've gotten better.

22:48.587 --> 22:53.091
Oh, Edward, no one needs
to know about this, okay?

22:53.125 --> 22:56.161
You take your medicine
at home every morning

22:56.194 --> 22:57.963
until you feel better.

23:20.886 --> 23:24.957
No, I've already been
put on hold twice.

23:24.990 --> 23:27.125
I gave them my account number.

23:29.695 --> 23:31.863
No, I told you there
is a problem with my bill.

23:31.897 --> 23:33.999
Mom?

23:34.032 --> 23:35.968
Then direct me
to the right person, please.

23:36.001 --> 23:41.740
- Mom.
- One second, Edward.

23:41.773 --> 23:43.976
Well, how can you do
business like this?

23:44.009 --> 23:46.244
This is ridiculous service.

23:48.981 --> 23:52.250
- What is it?
- Never mind.

23:52.284 --> 23:53.852
- Huh?
- Nothing.

23:55.587 --> 23:56.998
You don't have to drive me
to school today

23:57.022 --> 24:00.292
- I'm just gonna bike.
- Please be careful.

24:17.976 --> 24:20.212
Hey bird boy,
you want to come fly with us?

24:20.245 --> 24:25.150
Huh? Want to come fly?

24:25.183 --> 24:26.852
That was great.

24:53.111 --> 24:54.980
Not bad.

24:55.013 --> 24:58.350
Garden's looking really good.

24:58.383 --> 25:01.753
How's school this semester?

25:01.787 --> 25:03.655
I can't wait to be done.

25:03.688 --> 25:05.157
Oh.

25:05.190 --> 25:08.326
What's the matter?

25:08.360 --> 25:11.029
You can tell me.

25:11.063 --> 25:12.731
I hate that school.

25:12.764 --> 25:14.204
That's a typical attitude
for someone

25:14.232 --> 25:17.702
born in the year of the Tiger.

25:17.736 --> 25:20.939
Things are always hard
for Tigers early in life

25:20.972 --> 25:24.309
but as you grow older
and become an adult

25:24.342 --> 25:27.946
you'll find your way.

25:32.818 --> 25:34.028
It was a lot easier
to think straight

25:34.052 --> 25:36.855
before taking those pills?

25:42.160 --> 25:44.262
- Pills?
- Mom makes me take them

25:44.296 --> 25:46.832
even though they took
Dad away from me,

25:46.865 --> 25:50.669
she says I have to
live in reality.

25:50.702 --> 25:53.371
Dad was the only one
who had my back.

25:53.405 --> 25:57.409
Hello everyone,
I brought us dinner.

25:57.442 --> 25:59.945
Your favorite noodles, Edward.

26:10.696 --> 26:14.324
What's wrong? Everything okay?

26:14.825 --> 26:17.202
How's Edward been lately?

26:18.120 --> 26:20.747
Good. Everything's fine.

26:32.344 --> 26:34.679
Should have vegetables
to eat soon.

26:34.713 --> 26:36.214
You can bring them in
from the garden

26:36.248 --> 26:42.387
just like Daddy used to, huh.

26:42.420 --> 26:46.091
Do you like gardening
with Aunt Mei?

26:46.124 --> 26:52.030
Because there's no reason
to worry her about anything.

26:52.063 --> 26:56.935
Do you want to talk to me
about something?

26:56.968 --> 27:00.272
If something's the matter,
you talk to me first.

27:00.305 --> 27:03.441
Okay?

27:03.475 --> 27:07.979
I am your mother, Edward.

27:08.013 --> 27:11.116
It was a lot easier
talking to Dad.

27:34.172 --> 27:37.342
I've got your back.

27:37.375 --> 27:39.778
You've got my back.

27:58.363 --> 28:00.799
Bye Mom.

28:03.101 --> 28:05.136
Come on.

28:08.473 --> 28:12.410
Ten bucks bro if you say
something right now,

28:12.444 --> 28:17.082
anything at all.

28:17.115 --> 28:19.084
It's all yours.

28:19.117 --> 28:21.186
You just gotta speak.

28:21.219 --> 28:23.888
And go.

28:30.328 --> 28:32.397
Those of you looking
to redeem yourselves

28:32.430 --> 28:35.200
from your perfectly average

28:35.233 --> 28:38.203
or less than average start
to the semester

28:38.236 --> 28:41.306
you guys are in luck

28:41.339 --> 28:44.142
because today
we are going to start

28:44.175 --> 28:46.511
an entirely new section.

28:46.544 --> 28:48.280
On the Bill of Rights.

28:48.313 --> 28:52.884
Otherwise known as the first
ten amendments.

28:52.917 --> 28:56.288
So who wants to remind us...

29:00.492 --> 29:02.294
Edward?

29:02.327 --> 29:04.262
Are you paying attention?

29:04.296 --> 29:07.932
My question was, when was
the Constitution ratified?

29:11.336 --> 29:13.606
- 1788.
- That is right,

29:13.639 --> 29:15.140
thank you, Kang.

29:15.173 --> 29:17.509
On June 21st, 1788.

29:17.542 --> 29:20.579
New Hampshire became
the ninth state to ratify

29:20.613 --> 29:23.281
and under article seven,
the Constitution

29:23.315 --> 29:25.417
became the law of the land

29:25.450 --> 29:28.953
and the process of starting
a new government began.

30:04.089 --> 30:08.561
Bet you feel a whole lot better,
don't you?

30:08.594 --> 30:13.632
Not taking that poison.

30:13.666 --> 30:16.468
Gotta keep this clear, all right

30:16.501 --> 30:19.037
because no one else is going to
watch out for you.

30:19.070 --> 30:20.472
You know that, right?

30:20.505 --> 30:24.677
Definitely not any
of the zeros around here.

30:24.710 --> 30:26.411
Not your mom.

30:26.444 --> 30:32.618
Not your little gardening
pal either.

30:32.651 --> 30:39.524
No, you can't trust anyone,
all right.

30:39.558 --> 30:42.527
I'm here for you now,
little man.

30:42.561 --> 30:44.529
What do I always say?

30:44.563 --> 30:46.431
You've got my back.

30:46.464 --> 30:48.266
Damn right.

30:50.569 --> 30:55.974
You know that uh,
that illness that you've got,

30:56.007 --> 30:58.543
whatever they want to call it,

30:58.577 --> 31:00.579
that's a gift.

31:00.613 --> 31:04.115
That's what makes you special.

31:04.149 --> 31:05.483
And everyone else around you

31:05.517 --> 31:09.421
is going to want to
try and smother that

31:09.454 --> 31:11.356
and kill it.

31:11.389 --> 31:14.526
Cause that's what zeros do.

31:14.560 --> 31:19.230
You gotta stay sharp, Ed.

31:19.264 --> 31:21.332
You gotta fight back.

31:24.035 --> 31:28.006
Edward?

31:28.039 --> 31:30.709
Who are you talking to?

31:37.683 --> 31:41.186
Uh, just wanted to say sorry
about Kevin, man.

31:41.219 --> 31:44.155
- He can be a dick.
- He's a zero.

31:44.189 --> 31:48.727
There's not much anybody
can do about that.

32:14.553 --> 32:18.122
Hi, I'm picking up some
business cards for Hannah.

32:18.156 --> 32:20.693
I'm sorry, we just closed.

32:20.726 --> 32:24.529
Really? Cause the sign
says you're open.

32:24.563 --> 32:27.365
Please just come back later.

32:28.099 --> 32:30.268
Ugh.

32:35.664 --> 32:39.835
Mrs. Chang,
what else is good for depression?

32:41.378 --> 32:43.922
Am I that bad of a boss?

32:44.673 --> 32:48.051
Not for me, it's for a friend!

32:49.511 --> 32:54.141
Try 'chai hui'. It helps
open up the liver qi.

32:57.495 --> 33:00.131
Look, it's... stop.

33:00.164 --> 33:03.368
Right here.

33:03.401 --> 33:04.670
Here, let me get it.

33:04.703 --> 33:08.807
Here get your shovel.

33:08.841 --> 33:13.311
- Merry Christmas.
- Oh.

33:13.344 --> 33:17.415
All right, I'm going
back inside, Aunt Mei.

33:28.717 --> 33:30.844
A small gift from the store.

33:31.553 --> 33:35.057
I thought it might help Edward.

33:44.691 --> 33:46.777
Might be good for you, too.

33:47.069 --> 33:50.781
I know how stressful things
have been with the printing shop.

33:51.323 --> 33:53.951
And it's all natural, so much better...

33:53.992 --> 33:55.577
Better than what?

33:57.955 --> 34:05.587
Western medicine pushes problems away,
which only makes things worse.

34:05.963 --> 34:12.844
That's the kind of nonsense Michael believed.
Until the end, when it was too late.

34:13.719 --> 34:17.056
Mei, we're Americans now.

34:17.391 --> 34:20.561
Time to stop with the sorcery, okay?

34:52.543 --> 34:53.912
Edward.

34:53.946 --> 34:57.950
Edward?

34:57.983 --> 35:00.853
D-minus average?

35:00.886 --> 35:03.287
Are you not planning on
graduating high school?

35:03.321 --> 35:04.556
It's still passing, Mom.

35:04.590 --> 35:08.526
Oh, that's enough for you, huh?

35:08.560 --> 35:10.528
Life's just not about
playing games, you know.

35:10.562 --> 35:12.272
- You need to work harder.
- Mom, I told you

35:12.296 --> 35:13.775
I can't think straight
when I'm on those stupid pills

35:13.799 --> 35:15.266
- that you got me.
- Be an adult,

35:15.299 --> 35:17.201
take responsibility
for your actions.

35:17.235 --> 35:19.470
Mom, those pills
took Dad away from me.

35:19.504 --> 35:21.305
- That wasn't real, Edward.
- I don't care.

35:21.339 --> 35:23.374
- It was to me, okay.
- Don't be ridiculous.

35:23.408 --> 35:25.276
You have to live
in the real world.

35:25.309 --> 35:28.781
Than I don't want to
fucking live!

35:35.319 --> 35:39.357
I won't talk to you like this.

35:39.390 --> 35:41.760
Be a little bit more
appreciative.

35:41.794 --> 35:45.764
The insurance for your medicine
is very expensive.

35:45.798 --> 35:49.001
The store is losing money.

35:49.034 --> 35:52.503
We might have to sell it.

35:52.537 --> 35:55.007
Dad would never sell the store,
Mom.

35:55.040 --> 35:58.744
Things have changed.

35:58.777 --> 36:02.715
I'm dong the best I can
to take care of us.

36:12.624 --> 36:14.993
I'm going to take care
of things.

36:15.027 --> 36:17.863
I can get a job or something.

36:17.896 --> 36:20.666
I can help, you know.

36:20.699 --> 36:27.740
So just don't worry about me,
okay, Mom.

36:27.773 --> 36:29.975
Okay, Edward.

36:30.008 --> 36:32.010
I believe you.

36:32.044 --> 36:34.445
You take your medicine okay?

36:34.479 --> 36:39.017
And everything will be
all right.

36:39.051 --> 36:42.453
Goodnight, son.

36:49.460 --> 36:54.465
Well, damn.

36:54.499 --> 36:57.836
I think she's on to us,
little man.

36:57.870 --> 37:00.973
So what are you going to do?

37:03.642 --> 37:06.879
Maybe I should just do
what she says.

37:10.916 --> 37:13.752
Are you fucking kidding me?

37:13.786 --> 37:14.896
After what she's done to you

37:14.920 --> 37:16.955
you're still gonna trust her?

37:18.356 --> 37:20.592
No, no, no, Ed.

37:20.626 --> 37:22.961
We can't look back,
you understand?

37:22.995 --> 37:26.632
The only way is forward now.

37:29.001 --> 37:32.503
What did I teach you, huh?

37:32.537 --> 37:34.372
You gotta stay strong.

37:34.405 --> 37:37.042
You gotta stay clear.

37:38.710 --> 37:40.579
How?

37:58.964 --> 38:02.500
I told you, little man.

38:02.533 --> 38:04.970
I got your back.

38:21.720 --> 38:23.755
- You're up so early.
- Yeah, I wanted to go to

38:23.789 --> 38:25.591
the library before
school started.

38:25.624 --> 38:28.794
- I'll make you some food.
- Oh Mom, I already ate.

38:28.827 --> 38:32.030
Thank you, though.

38:32.064 --> 38:34.900
Edward, instead of going
to the store today

38:34.933 --> 38:37.870
I was gonna stay at home
and just get some work done.

38:37.903 --> 38:39.638
Okay, yeah, that's fine.

38:39.671 --> 38:41.974
I was gonna bike
to school anyways.

38:42.007 --> 38:46.979
You should get some rest, Mom.

38:47.012 --> 38:50.048
Okay, I've got to go.

38:59.191 --> 39:02.160
Have a good day.

39:30.155 --> 39:33.992
Paging Dr. Stamen,
Dr. Stamen please.

39:34.026 --> 39:36.527
Morrow.

39:52.309 --> 39:55.187
Surprised to see you in here.

40:02.110 --> 40:04.238
Everything alright?

40:04.696 --> 40:06.740
They can't operate.

40:08.534 --> 40:12.746
Too many blood vessels
in the way. It's too dangerous.

40:13.622 --> 40:18.544
But it's small. Hasn't spread yet.

40:19.503 --> 40:21.136
What's going to happen?

40:21.206 --> 40:24.876
Chemo, steroid, radiation.

40:25.217 --> 40:27.970
My best chance of living.

40:28.512 --> 40:29.972
Did you tell Edward?

40:30.222 --> 40:32.808
No, and he can't find out!

40:33.141 --> 40:34.852
That's why I came to you first.

40:36.270 --> 40:38.522
I'll need your help with this.

40:40.524 --> 40:41.859
Of course.

40:42.568 --> 40:46.446
I'm here for you. Whatever you need!

41:00.178 --> 41:02.047
Mom?

41:02.080 --> 41:07.753
Mom!

41:07.786 --> 41:09.688
What is it?

41:09.721 --> 41:14.059
What's wrong?

41:14.092 --> 41:19.064
How do you say raspberries
in Chinese again?

41:21.199 --> 41:23.268
Right.

41:30.375 --> 41:35.647
The garden looks really good,
Edward.

41:35.680 --> 41:40.152
I know it's hard to believe
cause you're still young

41:40.185 --> 41:42.954
but I'm only trying to help you.

41:42.988 --> 41:47.726
I'm not always going to be
around to take care of you.

41:47.759 --> 41:53.165
I want you to be happy
and do well in life.

41:53.198 --> 41:56.601
Maybe when you're older
you'll understand.

42:00.205 --> 42:04.576
We're not so different.

42:10.916 --> 42:16.221
How do you say chili pepper?

43:27.325 --> 43:29.895
What started as an ordinary day
in Eastern High School

43:29.928 --> 43:33.098
ended yesterday in gun fire
and death.

43:33.131 --> 43:35.000
Reports of gun shots
came in from the school

43:35.033 --> 43:36.935
as students were about to leave.

43:36.968 --> 43:39.137
I felt students pushing
against me.

43:39.171 --> 43:42.407
I just heard noises
and banging and shouting.

43:42.440 --> 43:44.009
It was chaos.

43:44.042 --> 43:46.044
Students quickly took cover
as news spread

43:46.077 --> 43:48.246
of an active shooter on campus.

43:48.280 --> 43:50.916
Authorities said that over
50 students were shot.

43:50.949 --> 43:52.460
The thing that kept running
through my head

43:52.484 --> 43:55.987
was "run, just go"
not a lot of the students

43:56.021 --> 43:58.181
knew where the shots were coming
from and I had seen...

43:58.639 --> 44:01.433
What happened? Was it a fire?

44:01.934 --> 44:06.146
A high school boy shot thirty students.

44:06.939 --> 44:08.857
How could anyone do that?

44:09.483 --> 44:12.694
Easy to blame one person, and not society.

44:13.070 --> 44:18.534
Think about all the different countries,
cultures and opinions here, mixing together.

44:19.243 --> 44:22.120
Of course there will be imbalance.

44:22.788 --> 44:27.584
In the old days,
if there was lack of harmony.

44:28.085 --> 44:33.090
"Fashi" priests would perform
rituals to restore balance.

44:34.258 --> 44:36.134
Shame there aren't priests like that here.

44:36.385 --> 44:40.013
There are! But no one cares these days.

44:40.889 --> 44:44.226
A few years ago,
when my customer's husband died,

44:44.560 --> 44:47.062
she was lost in the darkness.

44:47.813 --> 44:52.818
But after just one visit to the "Fashi",

44:53.527 --> 44:57.531
she was completely transformed.
So alive, and filled with light!

44:57.948 --> 44:59.366
And this was here?

44:59.408 --> 45:01.577
Yes, at Jia Hu.

45:02.619 --> 45:04.746
Mrs. Chang, the restaurant?

45:05.372 --> 45:07.332
The "Fashi" works in the kitchen.

45:07.749 --> 45:12.087
The owner likes having him there!
It brings the restaurant good luck.

45:34.919 --> 45:37.122
Two treatments left,

45:37.155 --> 45:40.058
You're nearly done.

45:40.091 --> 45:42.961
This radiation
is killing me faster.

45:42.994 --> 45:44.296
You can't talk like that.

45:44.329 --> 45:46.197
You have to think positive

45:46.231 --> 45:49.868
and you need to stay strong
for Edward.

45:53.572 --> 45:56.041
How the shooting started
outside the building.

45:56.074 --> 45:58.043
Afterwards,
the suspect moved inside

45:58.076 --> 45:59.411
leaving a deadly trail
of students

45:59.444 --> 46:01.046
and teachers in his wake...

46:01.079 --> 46:04.382
Oh, Edward should be home soon.

46:04.416 --> 46:08.253
With two victims losing their
lives in hospital overnight.

46:08.286 --> 46:11.923
A community and the entire
nation is left rattled.

46:11.956 --> 46:15.193
With gun fire tearing through
yet another American school.

46:15.226 --> 46:17.495
The president has offered
his thoughts and prayers.

46:17.528 --> 46:21.657
So tragic. But we can't only blame the boy.

46:22.407 --> 46:24.660
I don't blame the boy at all.

46:25.786 --> 46:29.122
They should take those
parents out and hang them!

46:34.212 --> 46:37.315
Few people believe
anything will change.

46:37.349 --> 46:39.250
- So far...
- Hey.

46:39.284 --> 46:41.853
Hello, Edward.

47:02.240 --> 47:04.542
Where did I fail as a parent?

47:04.577 --> 47:06.645
Everyday I have to
live with the idea

47:06.679 --> 47:10.281
that my child committed such
a horrible and brutal crime.

47:10.315 --> 47:12.417
You're convinced
as a parent that you know

47:12.450 --> 47:15.153
who your kids are,
so I didn't get involved

47:15.186 --> 47:17.656
until it was too late.

47:17.690 --> 47:20.225
And now I have to live with that

47:20.258 --> 47:22.260
and that feeling will never,
ever, ever go away

47:22.293 --> 47:24.896
as long as I live.

48:47.078 --> 48:49.080
Don't know why you're
wasting yourself on him.

48:49.113 --> 48:50.548
He doesn't deserve to be alive.

48:50.583 --> 48:51.784
What?

48:51.817 --> 48:54.486
What are you talking about?

48:54.519 --> 48:55.630
Why do you want
to be with this guy?

48:55.654 --> 48:57.088
He's a total zero.

48:57.121 --> 48:58.189
Kevin!

48:58.223 --> 48:59.357
Stop it!

48:59.390 --> 49:00.559
He's not worth it!

49:06.531 --> 49:07.566
What are you doing?

49:22.848 --> 49:25.083
Shitty-ass feeling, right?

49:32.524 --> 49:35.293
Come on, man,
I'm not your fuckin' mom.

49:35.326 --> 49:37.730
And you're not a kid anymore,
you can do whatever you want.

49:57.382 --> 49:59.752
This place gives me the creeps.

49:59.785 --> 50:03.087
Bunch of fuckin' roaches
crawling around.

50:03.121 --> 50:04.657
It's disgusting.

50:07.893 --> 50:10.194
Kinda makes you want
to do something.

50:10.228 --> 50:11.429
Right?

50:13.632 --> 50:15.601
You got any paper in there,
little man?

50:26.645 --> 50:28.146
What about them?

50:30.181 --> 50:32.150
Zeroes.

50:42.193 --> 50:43.193
And those two?

50:48.399 --> 50:50.869
Fucking zeroes.

50:50.903 --> 50:52.571
Both of 'em.

51:26.705 --> 51:27.773
Mom?

51:29.742 --> 51:30.809
Mom!

51:37.783 --> 51:39.885
Where are my games?
What did you do with them?

51:39.918 --> 51:41.754
You need to spend
more time studying.

51:41.787 --> 51:44.255
- Focus on school.
- Where are they, Mom?

51:44.288 --> 51:47.926
I'll give them back
after you pass your exams!

51:47.960 --> 51:49.704
You took Dad away,
now you're taking my games away?

51:49.728 --> 51:50.596
Jesus Christ, Mom.

51:50.629 --> 51:53.264
Have you been smoking?

51:53.297 --> 51:54.767
Look who's talking.

51:54.800 --> 51:56.568
Answer me!

51:56.602 --> 51:57.670
Are you smoking now?

51:57.703 --> 51:58.570
You can't just go into my room
anytime you want.

51:58.604 --> 52:01.239
I'm nearly fucking
18 years old, Mom.

52:01.272 --> 52:03.207
- Not a little boy anymore.
- That's right!

52:03.241 --> 52:04.318
- You're my son!
- Oh, my God!

52:04.342 --> 52:07.512
You still live in my house,
so you do what I say!

52:07.545 --> 52:10.415
You keep your door unlocked
from now on.

52:17.723 --> 52:18.791
You have enough?

52:18.824 --> 52:20.726
You feel better?

52:32.738 --> 52:37.375
I was thinking of taking Edward
shopping after school.

52:37.408 --> 52:40.311
We need to pick up
a few things for the garden.

52:42.037 --> 52:45.624
Then you could get some rest, right?

52:46.885 --> 52:48.453
Lily.

53:02.000 --> 53:04.368
She's going through a lot,
Edward.

53:04.402 --> 53:05.971
Life has been so hard for her,

53:06.004 --> 53:08.406
you can't even imagine.

53:08.439 --> 53:10.374
But she loves you.

53:10.408 --> 53:12.778
That's all that matters.

53:12.811 --> 53:14.713
Don't ever forget that.

53:22.420 --> 53:24.990
You can tell her
you love her too sometimes.

53:43.642 --> 53:44.642
Ready?

53:45.878 --> 53:48.981
These are the same tools
my dad had.

53:49.014 --> 53:50.916
Can we get them?

53:50.949 --> 53:52.651
We already have tools,

53:52.684 --> 53:54.385
and they're too expensive.

53:54.418 --> 53:56.755
Come on, let's go.

54:13.437 --> 54:16.340
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.

54:16.374 --> 54:17.654
Where you running to,
little man?

54:18.944 --> 54:20.712
Class.

54:20.746 --> 54:21.914
Class.

54:21.947 --> 54:23.749
What, so that's it,
just like that,

54:23.782 --> 54:25.784
you like class now?

54:27.385 --> 54:28.654
- Hm?
- No, I don't.

54:28.687 --> 54:32.024
No, so then why go?

54:32.057 --> 54:34.660
Always playing
by the rules, right?

54:34.693 --> 54:36.662
Letting them control you?

54:37.996 --> 54:40.966
The way you think,
the way you look?

54:40.999 --> 54:43.702
You need to man the fuck up!

54:43.735 --> 54:45.037
You hear me?

54:45.070 --> 54:47.371
This isn't a game.

54:47.405 --> 54:48.750
You're almost 18,
you're supposed to be a man.

54:48.774 --> 54:50.642
You still act like a little boy.

54:52.744 --> 54:54.913
What a fuckin' joke.

55:11.196 --> 55:12.965
I think it's time
we step things up.

56:35.781 --> 56:36.781
Bye, Mom.

57:11.098 --> 57:13.267
Little devil!

57:46.216 --> 57:48.093
Dawei...

57:50.596 --> 57:53.640
I only want the best for you.

58:12.811 --> 58:13.979
Boo!

58:16.648 --> 58:17.925
You ever think
how different things would be

58:17.949 --> 58:21.153
if Aunt Mei was my mom
and you got mine instead?

58:21.186 --> 58:23.855
What are you talking about?

58:23.889 --> 58:26.358
I'm talking about being a one.

58:26.391 --> 58:29.361
Doing something big
and making a difference,

58:29.394 --> 58:32.597
something people
will remember you by.

58:36.835 --> 58:39.371
You gotta stay ready, man.

58:39.404 --> 58:41.006
- Are you a one or you a zero...
- Dude,

58:41.039 --> 58:43.842
stop with the freak show, okay?

58:43.875 --> 58:45.343
You're not fooling anyone.

58:45.377 --> 58:47.846
You act weird, you got a tattoo?

58:47.879 --> 58:50.849
All right, look, I get it,
you want attention,

58:50.882 --> 58:53.018
but this isn't the way to do it.

58:53.051 --> 58:54.786
Just grow the fuck up.

59:16.041 --> 59:17.676
Let's not forget about him.

59:22.114 --> 59:25.317
He fucking disgusts me.

59:25.350 --> 59:27.085
It's time for some payback.

59:42.767 --> 59:43.802
Kevin!

59:45.337 --> 59:46.771
Kevin!

59:58.216 --> 1:00:00.719
You think getting a tattoo
makes you tough?

1:00:13.498 --> 1:00:15.267
Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

1:00:15.300 --> 1:00:16.434
Bang! Bang!

1:00:18.503 --> 1:00:19.503
Kevin!

1:00:21.773 --> 1:00:23.108
Kevin! Kevin, stop it!

1:00:23.141 --> 1:00:26.011
No, no, no, Ms. Li,
we thought he had a gun!

1:00:26.044 --> 1:00:27.846
I didn't do anything,
I didn't even touch you.

1:00:29.514 --> 1:00:30.916
Come on.

1:00:30.949 --> 1:00:32.450
Edward, come on, let's g...

1:00:32.484 --> 1:00:35.253
all right,
turn around, let's go.

1:00:35.287 --> 1:00:37.155
Walk. Turn around.

1:00:43.028 --> 1:00:45.397
Keep going.

1:00:45.430 --> 1:00:47.165
I am.

1:00:53.071 --> 1:00:54.940
How can you be so stupid?

1:00:54.973 --> 1:00:57.475
Skipping class,
trying to hurt other students!

1:00:57.509 --> 1:00:59.377
I didn't hurt anyone,
I didn't even touch him.

1:00:59.411 --> 1:01:01.251
He's an asshole,
so I just wanted to scare him.

1:01:01.279 --> 1:01:03.081
It doesn't matter, Edward!

1:01:03.114 --> 1:01:06.117
Those children were crying,
they were scared to death!

1:01:06.151 --> 1:01:08.119
- What happened?
- Edward thought it'd be funny

1:01:08.153 --> 1:01:09.955
to pretend he had a gun
in school!

1:01:09.988 --> 1:01:11.056
Stupid boy!

1:01:11.089 --> 1:01:12.824
And right before your exams!

1:01:12.857 --> 1:01:14.159
Why would you do such a thing?

1:01:14.192 --> 1:01:15.760
Kevin doesn't deserve Jessica.

1:01:15.794 --> 1:01:17.038
People like him
add nothing to this world

1:01:17.062 --> 1:01:18.763
because he's a fucking zero!

1:01:18.797 --> 1:01:21.433
You're turning 18 next week,
but you behave like a child.

1:01:21.466 --> 1:01:23.168
Yeah, and happy
fucking birthday to me!

1:01:23.201 --> 1:01:24.769
What a great life I have!

1:01:24.803 --> 1:01:26.972
See how you act when you don't
take your medicine?

1:01:29.908 --> 1:01:32.077
I found the pills
you were hiding.

1:01:32.110 --> 1:01:33.511
You betrayed me, Dawei.

1:01:36.081 --> 1:01:37.858
This is the poison
my own mother makes me take

1:01:37.882 --> 1:01:38.850
because she thinks I'm crazy,

1:01:38.883 --> 1:01:40.061
even though I told her
it makes things worse

1:01:40.085 --> 1:01:43.121
and I can't think straight
when I'm on these pills.

1:01:43.154 --> 1:01:46.091
Even though the bitch
stole my dad away from me.

1:01:54.099 --> 1:01:56.368
This is all over when I turn 18.

1:03:13.502 --> 1:03:17.506
I heard about your special
services from a friend.

1:03:18.507 --> 1:03:20.217
What's the problem?

1:03:31.329 --> 1:03:33.632
Do you guys do banners?

1:03:33.666 --> 1:03:35.400
Excuse me?

1:03:43.709 --> 1:03:45.678
It's fine.

1:03:45.711 --> 1:03:47.178
I'll just...

1:03:47.212 --> 1:03:49.247
I'll just come back later,
another time.

1:03:54.285 --> 1:03:57.690
The tumor is pushing against
your pituitary gland.

1:03:57.723 --> 1:04:00.492
That's what's
making you lactate.

1:04:00.525 --> 1:04:03.428
Now, we could surgically
remove the gland,

1:04:03.461 --> 1:04:05.598
but I'm afraid,
in the larger scheme of things,

1:04:05.631 --> 1:04:08.433
it wouldn't be that effective.

1:04:08.466 --> 1:04:11.704
Mrs. Morrow,
the cancer has spread.

1:04:11.737 --> 1:04:13.171
It's at a stage now

1:04:13.204 --> 1:04:15.574
where there's very little
we can do.

1:04:15.608 --> 1:04:18.009
How long?

1:04:18.042 --> 1:04:20.679
Less than a month.

1:04:20.713 --> 1:04:22.615
I'm so sorry.

1:05:05.457 --> 1:05:06.458
Hm.

1:05:09.260 --> 1:05:10.696
Dawei.

1:05:10.729 --> 1:05:12.665
Happy birthday.

1:05:42.695 --> 1:05:44.730
You fucking liar!

1:06:49.762 --> 1:06:52.163
You gotta stay strong,
little man.

1:06:52.196 --> 1:06:53.699
Keep your chin up.

1:06:56.134 --> 1:06:57.636
Hey.

1:06:57.670 --> 1:06:58.671
Hey!

1:06:58.704 --> 1:07:00.471
Now's the time for action.

1:07:00.505 --> 1:07:02.775
Right? Don't overthink it.

1:07:02.808 --> 1:07:05.878
Don't lose your nerve now.

1:07:05.911 --> 1:07:09.213
You can't stop
what we started, Ed.

1:07:09.247 --> 1:07:11.182
There's no turning back now.

1:07:12.383 --> 1:07:14.118
Come on, you knew.

1:07:14.152 --> 1:07:16.421
You knew, you always knew
the time would come

1:07:16.454 --> 1:07:17.422
to make a choice, right?

1:07:17.455 --> 1:07:20.124
Well, now's that time,
so be a fucking man.

1:07:20.158 --> 1:07:22.393
You can't give in
to these emotions.

1:07:22.427 --> 1:07:23.629
I told you, right?

1:07:23.662 --> 1:07:26.130
I told you
you couldn't trust her.

1:07:31.402 --> 1:07:33.338
She's gonna die.

1:08:11.810 --> 1:08:13.277
What?

1:08:15.881 --> 1:08:17.950
My God.

1:08:17.983 --> 1:08:19.652
What happened?

1:08:24.604 --> 1:08:27.357
Today is his eighteenth birthday.

1:08:28.442 --> 1:08:30.277
Can you believe it?

1:08:33.071 --> 1:08:36.491
This is the child I brought into the world.

1:08:37.075 --> 1:08:38.618
Where is Edward?

1:08:39.203 --> 1:08:40.787
He ran away.

1:08:41.246 --> 1:08:43.207
Why don't you call him?

1:08:43.790 --> 1:08:47.920
No point any more, for any of it.

1:08:51.449 --> 1:08:52.951
Hi, Edward, it's Aunt Mei.

1:08:52.985 --> 1:08:54.385
Where are you?

1:08:55.921 --> 1:08:57.656
Okay.

1:08:57.690 --> 1:08:59.290
I'll be right there.

1:08:59.765 --> 1:09:01.850
I'm going to get him.

1:09:08.564 --> 1:09:13.362
Lily, I believe that
in his heart, Edward is good.

1:09:14.529 --> 1:09:16.073
There's someone I went to see.

1:09:16.948 --> 1:09:18.867
I think he might be able to help.

1:09:19.243 --> 1:09:22.912
Not a doctor. A kind of priest,
who does special work.

1:09:23.622 --> 1:09:28.042
There's something he can try
to drive out Edward's bad energy.

1:09:29.545 --> 1:09:32.339
You've tried everything else!

1:09:32.965 --> 1:09:36.051
What do we have to lose?

1:09:37.219 --> 1:09:39.888
It's not far, we can go tonight.

1:09:40.596 --> 1:09:43.183
I'll go first to pick him up, okay?

1:09:52.410 --> 1:09:54.512
Edward, it's okay.

1:09:56.048 --> 1:09:57.683
We're going to fix this.

1:09:57.716 --> 1:09:59.417
Aunt Mei is going
to take you to someone

1:09:59.450 --> 1:10:01.954
who can really help.

1:10:01.987 --> 1:10:03.421
Come on!

1:10:23.842 --> 1:10:24.943
What are we doing here?

1:10:24.977 --> 1:10:26.745
One second, Edward.

1:10:37.790 --> 1:10:39.758
These men are going to help you.

1:10:39.792 --> 1:10:41.325
Come on.

1:11:38.183 --> 1:11:40.052
Get the fuck off me!

1:11:44.990 --> 1:11:46.825
Aunt Mei, what the fuck?

1:11:48.526 --> 1:11:50.461
What's happening?

1:11:52.865 --> 1:11:53.966
Get off me!

1:12:01.029 --> 1:12:04.408
Leave. Go now.

1:12:13.792 --> 1:12:17.421
You will leave this body.

1:12:23.927 --> 1:12:25.929
Get out!

1:12:35.272 --> 1:12:36.815
Shouldn't we stop?

1:12:37.191 --> 1:12:39.484
What are we doing to him?

1:14:08.600 --> 1:14:10.702
No point wearing this anymore.

1:14:12.671 --> 1:14:14.973
You don't have to go to school
if you don't want to.

1:14:15.007 --> 1:14:16.808
You're 18 now.

1:14:16.842 --> 1:14:19.745
I guess you can do
whatever you want.

1:14:19.778 --> 1:14:22.881
I just thought maybe you'd
prefer to stay home and rest.

1:17:29.301 --> 1:17:31.102
Are you looking
for some ammo today too?

1:18:39.386 --> 1:18:43.891
Lily, how has Edward been?

1:18:45.934 --> 1:18:48.187
I didn't hear from you.

1:18:49.271 --> 1:18:51.356
I've been so worried.

1:18:53.385 --> 1:18:54.386
Hello?

1:18:56.862 --> 1:19:00.699
You were always a much
better mother than me, Mei.

1:19:01.126 --> 1:19:03.161
Hello?

1:19:03.194 --> 1:19:04.996
Lily!

1:19:20.345 --> 1:19:22.981
What's going on?

1:19:23.014 --> 1:19:25.083
Why'd you take me out of school?

1:19:25.116 --> 1:19:27.452
I thought you'd be happy.

1:19:27.485 --> 1:19:29.487
But I've got things to do,

1:19:29.521 --> 1:19:31.089
and I've got stuff in my locker.

1:19:31.122 --> 1:19:32.157
Leave it.

1:19:32.190 --> 1:19:34.025
You'll get it tomorrow.

1:19:40.098 --> 1:19:42.534
Lily! Open the door!

1:19:44.202 --> 1:19:46.538
Lily! Edward!

1:20:03.121 --> 1:20:05.056
One room left, come on.

1:20:18.637 --> 1:20:21.206
Not too bad, right?

1:20:21.239 --> 1:20:23.475
This is going to be fun.

1:20:30.382 --> 1:20:32.016
Why did we drive
all the way out here?

1:20:34.687 --> 1:20:37.088
What are we doing here?

1:20:37.122 --> 1:20:39.257
It's your birthday surprise.

1:20:39.290 --> 1:20:41.459
I wanted to do
something special,

1:20:41.493 --> 1:20:43.629
get out of the house
for a change.

1:20:46.632 --> 1:20:49.267
I brought your nice clothes.

1:20:49.300 --> 1:20:51.503
I'm taking you out for dinner.

1:20:57.041 --> 1:20:58.243
Eighteen.

1:20:59.678 --> 1:21:01.580
You're an adult now.

1:21:04.650 --> 1:21:07.385
You look so handsome, Edward.

1:21:07.419 --> 1:21:09.688
Daddy would be so proud.

1:21:15.293 --> 1:21:19.030
You know, you never used to cry.

1:21:20.733 --> 1:21:23.501
You were the quietest baby.

1:21:23.535 --> 1:21:26.438
It scared me.

1:21:26.471 --> 1:21:28.707
I would go into your room
four or five times every night

1:21:28.741 --> 1:21:32.377
and make you cry
just so I knew you were alive.

1:21:35.614 --> 1:21:36.614
Edward.

1:21:38.584 --> 1:21:41.620
We have nothing
to fight about anymore.

1:21:43.789 --> 1:21:46.324
We put the past behind us now.

1:21:47.793 --> 1:21:50.395
None of that matters anymore.

1:22:04.375 --> 1:22:06.745
I know you love me, Mom.

1:22:24.229 --> 1:22:26.197
Go to sleep, Edward.

1:22:26.231 --> 1:22:28.032
You're tired.

1:24:20.445 --> 1:24:21.614
Mom.

1:24:23.849 --> 1:24:25.684
I'm thirsty.

1:24:27.234 --> 1:24:30.112
Goodbye, Dawei.

1:26:12.858 --> 1:26:17.361
The court is accepting today
the defendant's plea of guilty.

1:26:17.395 --> 1:26:19.430
I'm fully satisfied
that she's competent

1:26:19.464 --> 1:26:21.499
to enter this plea.

1:26:21.532 --> 1:26:23.969
The facts support it.

1:26:24.002 --> 1:26:27.906
And you are found guilty
at this time.

1:26:27.940 --> 1:26:31.677
Frankly, my words fail me.

1:26:31.710 --> 1:26:35.513
How could you do such a thing
to your own son?

1:26:45.958 --> 1:26:50.394
"He was my responsibility.

1:26:50.428 --> 1:26:52.363
I am his mother."

1:26:55.333 --> 1:26:58.003
Sentencing is set for the 23rd.

1:27:35.756 --> 1:27:40.177
He would have hurt someone, one day.

1:27:41.720 --> 1:27:45.182
I had no choice.

1:27:48.310 --> 1:27:54.900
There's only one beautiful child
in the world, and every mother has it.

1:28:03.367 --> 1:28:08.205
Take everything, and burn it.

1:28:11.291 --> 1:28:14.419
No one should remember us.

1:28:15.629 --> 1:28:18.340
Burn it all.

1:28:19.633 --> 1:28:22.636
So we are forgotten.
