02:31.443 --> 02:35.564
Thirty-seven minutes and 15 seconds.

02:37.491 --> 02:42.442
I'm gonna stay within a
30-mile area of the cabin.

03:13.485 --> 03:18.489
Excuse me, miss.
Yes, I'm sorry to bother you.

03:18.490 --> 03:21.518
I'm looking for the post office.

03:24.663 --> 03:30.000
You are? Would you like
me to give you a lift?

03:30.001 --> 03:32.574
What? Please.

03:34.172 --> 03:35.664
Please.

03:47.644 --> 03:49.591
Oh, shit!

04:34.357 --> 04:36.759
Excuse me, I just...

05:18.443 --> 05:20.095
Hi, Dad.

05:22.781 --> 05:26.151
- What are you reading?
- Nothing.

05:26.493 --> 05:28.895
<i>Wuthering Heights?</i>

05:29.454 --> 05:33.833
"Catherine, is it not sufficient
that while you're at peace...

05:33.834 --> 05:36.877
I shall ride in the
torments of hell?"

05:36.878 --> 05:38.530
Denise.

05:38.630 --> 05:40.756
It's romantic!

05:40.757 --> 05:44.331
If they can put it
in a book, it's not.

05:44.469 --> 05:47.213
Romance has to be secret.

05:49.558 --> 05:52.006
Do you have a girlfriend?

05:53.728 --> 05:56.981
I mean, fixing the cabin...

05:56.982 --> 05:59.510
I'm not stupid, you know.

05:59.776 --> 06:03.055
I wouldn't blame you
for cheating on Mother.

06:03.488 --> 06:07.233
That's not a nice
thing to say, is it?

06:30.891 --> 06:36.013
Got your nose. Haven't you
ever played Got Your Nose?

06:46.740 --> 06:51.236
Don't make a face when you
see it. Imagine it fixed up.

07:18.021 --> 07:21.675
Daddy? How many stars are there?

07:22.025 --> 07:23.972
They're infinite.

07:28.990 --> 07:30.858
There are so many...

07:30.909 --> 07:32.777
and so far away...

07:33.745 --> 07:36.568
that they can't be counted.

07:37.540 --> 07:40.568
You'd never get to the end.

07:41.086 --> 07:42.711
Ever?

07:42.712 --> 07:44.284
Ever.

07:49.678 --> 07:51.330
You hungry?

07:51.930 --> 07:54.503
Open the picnic basket.

07:59.396 --> 08:02.523
It's all right. They're only spiders.

08:02.524 --> 08:04.551
They can't hurt you.

08:19.791 --> 08:21.693
Hey, Barney!

08:22.293 --> 08:24.445
Hi, Stan!

08:31.052 --> 08:34.331
Were you here at
your place last night?

08:34.806 --> 08:39.052
- Yeah, why?
- I thought I heard screams.

08:39.811 --> 08:41.962
Like a child.

08:44.607 --> 08:46.554
I didn't hear a thing.

08:52.782 --> 08:55.184
Have a nice day.

09:09.924 --> 09:13.927
Miss, can you tell me how
to get to the post office?

09:13.928 --> 09:15.580
Yeah, sure.

09:16.890 --> 09:19.516
You go straight down, about a mile.

09:19.517 --> 09:23.520
- It's off Handley.
- That's what I couldn't remember.

09:23.521 --> 09:25.856
Thanks. Are you going that way?

09:25.857 --> 09:30.433
- I can give you a lift.
- No, it's okay. Excuse me.

10:04.729 --> 10:08.303
3:05.

10:13.071 --> 10:15.989
One-eighty.

10:15.990 --> 10:18.492
- Excuse me, miss?
- Go away.

10:18.493 --> 10:21.772
- Can you tell me how to...?
- Don't bother me!

10:35.301 --> 10:39.672
3:44.

10:42.684 --> 10:44.802
Ninety-five.

10:55.822 --> 10:58.475
Are you having an affair?

11:03.788 --> 11:05.906
I love you.

11:06.708 --> 11:08.781
I love Denise.

11:11.212 --> 11:15.757
I know you think restoring
this cabin is a crazy idea...

11:15.758 --> 11:18.001
but what if it's not?

11:18.303 --> 11:21.627
What if I'm learning about myself...

11:22.640 --> 11:26.965
realizing that if I can do this,
I can do anything?

11:27.312 --> 11:29.146
So I take a step.

11:29.147 --> 11:32.300
I think, "Is this crazy?
Should I stop?"

11:32.734 --> 11:34.807
Then I think:

11:35.612 --> 11:37.070
"Not yet.

11:37.071 --> 11:40.699
There's always time to turn back...

11:40.700 --> 11:44.400
if I want to."
So I take another step...

11:45.914 --> 11:47.657
and another...

11:47.749 --> 11:49.492
and another...

11:51.836 --> 11:54.910
until one day I realize that...

11:56.841 --> 11:59.009
I've crossed that line...

11:59.010 --> 12:01.412
and there's no turning back.

12:23.034 --> 12:25.277
Let's get out of here.

12:25.286 --> 12:28.914
- What? This is what we came for.
- Let's go.

12:28.915 --> 12:32.501
We didn't drive from Seattle
just to go back home.

12:32.502 --> 12:34.199
Please?

12:41.594 --> 12:45.214
- Where do you wanna go?
- Nowhere.

12:45.848 --> 12:48.433
- Don't sulk.
- I'm not sulking.

12:48.434 --> 12:50.381
We're on vacation.

12:59.779 --> 13:01.806
Okay.

13:02.115 --> 13:06.019
There must be other
disaster areas to go to.

13:18.006 --> 13:20.579
- What was that?
- Nothing.

13:26.597 --> 13:29.725
- Oh, come on! No!
- Shit!

13:29.726 --> 13:31.469
Shit!

13:35.106 --> 13:38.692
I don't believe this.
I told you we needed gas.

13:38.693 --> 13:41.721
- It happened, okay?
- It's not okay.

13:48.161 --> 13:50.203
Why are you so upset?

13:50.204 --> 13:54.082
Nobody can see us until
they are on top of us!

13:54.083 --> 13:56.960
Why didn't you stop?
We passed 10 places!

13:56.961 --> 13:59.921
They can see us fine, okay, Diane?

13:59.922 --> 14:02.040
Oh, God!

14:06.262 --> 14:10.417
- Oh, God! No!
- Just calm down.

14:14.854 --> 14:17.973
- Should we push it?
- Let's go.

14:18.566 --> 14:20.275
I'll get the flashlight.

14:20.276 --> 14:23.111
- Flashlight? Jesus Christ, Di!
- Find it!

14:23.112 --> 14:26.231
- What are you gonna do with it?
- You go.

14:26.491 --> 14:29.534
You'll never find
anything in that mess.

14:29.535 --> 14:33.235
- Jeff, I'll find it!
- I'm going!

14:36.000 --> 14:38.744
Jeff, don't leave me alone!

14:57.980 --> 15:00.257
Diane?

15:37.520 --> 15:41.675
I shouldn't have left you.
I lost my head.

15:41.941 --> 15:44.059
I don't know why I did it.

15:49.949 --> 15:51.771
I love you.

15:52.201 --> 15:53.944
I'm sorry.

17:01.812 --> 17:03.271
That's 15 bucks.

17:03.272 --> 17:04.844
Thanks.

17:06.858 --> 17:08.727
There.

17:16.202 --> 17:18.525
Okay, let's go home.

17:18.788 --> 17:23.364
No, park the car. Park the car.

17:33.469 --> 17:34.961
What?

17:35.429 --> 17:37.672
Now repeat after me.

17:40.351 --> 17:41.843
I...

17:42.770 --> 17:44.271
- I...
- I...

17:44.272 --> 17:47.300
- ...Jeff Harriman...
- ...Jeff Harriman...

17:47.567 --> 17:53.565
- ...swear that the wonderful...
- ...swear that the wonderful...

17:55.491 --> 17:58.285
the exquisite and sweet...

17:58.286 --> 18:00.495
The potentially sweet...

18:00.496 --> 18:02.330
The always sweet...

18:02.331 --> 18:06.076
- ...Diane Shaver...
- The always sweet Diane Shaver...

18:06.919 --> 18:09.663
Will never be left by me again.

18:10.089 --> 18:12.742
Will never be left by me again.

18:13.175 --> 18:15.010
Till death do us part.

18:15.011 --> 18:17.129
Till death do us part.

18:20.141 --> 18:22.464
That makes it feel so official.

18:37.533 --> 18:40.607
- I love you.
- I love you.

18:40.661 --> 18:42.483
- You all right?
- Mm-hm.

18:45.708 --> 18:48.418
I forgot. I have a present for you.

18:48.419 --> 18:51.288
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

18:54.383 --> 18:56.285
This is great!

18:56.344 --> 18:59.918
I wanted to give it
to you tonight, but...

19:00.389 --> 19:02.041
I screwed it up.

19:03.601 --> 19:05.685
"Forever, Diane."

19:05.686 --> 19:06.853
I don't smoke.

19:06.854 --> 19:09.598
For you to light my cigarette.

19:10.983 --> 19:13.101
- What?
- I wanna drive.

19:14.236 --> 19:19.866
I have to go to the bathroom.
You want anything? Soda pop, beer?

19:19.867 --> 19:21.519
Beer. That'd be great.

19:28.668 --> 19:30.536
Diane?

20:12.670 --> 20:15.573
What the hell is taking her so long?

20:30.980 --> 20:33.223
Oh, the keys.

21:05.973 --> 21:07.265
Diane?

21:07.266 --> 21:10.294
Hey! This is the ladies' room!

21:50.559 --> 21:52.757
Diane!

22:15.084 --> 22:17.361
Diane!

22:22.883 --> 22:25.760
I'm looking for my girlfriend.

22:25.761 --> 22:30.086
I've got a picture I took today.
She's wearing this.

22:30.933 --> 22:33.184
- Yes, I did see her.
- When?

22:33.185 --> 22:36.938
Half-hour ago. She was
over by the lotto machine.

22:36.939 --> 22:40.066
Was she alone?
Did she talk to anyone?

22:40.067 --> 22:42.193
You know how many people
pass through here?

22:42.194 --> 22:44.279
No cutting in line!

22:44.280 --> 22:48.074
My girlfriend's disappeared.
Has anyone seen her?

22:48.075 --> 22:50.819
Please. Anybody?

23:01.297 --> 23:05.717
We pulled in, we got gas.
We then parked in that space.

23:05.718 --> 23:09.721
She came into the store.
That's when she disappeared.

23:09.722 --> 23:11.840
Did you fight recently?

23:14.226 --> 23:16.853
Wasn't a fight. It was a thing.

23:16.854 --> 23:20.133
- A thing?
- Don't you have a girlfriend?

23:20.816 --> 23:24.694
Yeah, and if I think
something's just a thing...

23:24.695 --> 23:27.530
you can bet she'll
think it's a fight.

23:27.531 --> 23:30.909
I'll make a report,
but give it 24 hours...

23:30.910 --> 23:33.953
No, listen to me!
She has disappeared!

23:33.954 --> 23:37.957
Something happened to her.
It's not a lovers' quarrel.

23:37.958 --> 23:42.033
I urge you to move your
face back to where it was.

23:46.467 --> 23:49.510
Now, I know you're upset.

23:49.511 --> 23:53.806
If I get information indicating
foul play, I'll proceed.

23:53.807 --> 23:56.676
But for now, you better go home.

23:58.145 --> 23:59.717
That's it?

25:16.098 --> 25:19.809
I've had him in my class.
He's a complete failure.

25:19.810 --> 25:24.564
I know, but probably not a total
lost cause. Please, I just...

25:24.565 --> 25:27.275
Look, he put up a new one.

25:27.276 --> 25:31.738
I heard him on the radio.
Every month he replaces the posters.

25:31.739 --> 25:34.365
Every 30 days.
You can set your watch.

25:34.366 --> 25:37.235
He must've loved her very much.

25:38.704 --> 25:41.857
I do admire his perseverance.

26:31.340 --> 26:35.676
- Night of the living dead.
- I'll get him.

26:35.677 --> 26:38.679
No, this is your second
double this week.

26:38.680 --> 26:43.881
You got something more interesting?
Mel Gibson doesn't call.

26:49.441 --> 26:51.317
I know that guy.

26:51.318 --> 26:53.236
From where, prison?

26:53.237 --> 26:55.105
High school.

26:55.364 --> 26:57.766
I'll go get him, okay?

27:02.663 --> 27:04.360
Tough night?

27:05.958 --> 27:08.042
Coffee, please.

27:08.043 --> 27:12.672
You really think you need it?
You got luggage under those eyes.

27:12.673 --> 27:14.465
I'll bring you milk.

27:14.466 --> 27:18.120
I don't want milk.
I'd like coffee, please.

27:20.722 --> 27:23.432
How much sleep did
you get last night?

27:23.433 --> 27:26.427
Night before, night before that?

27:27.271 --> 27:29.469
One milk, coming up.

27:34.903 --> 27:37.226
How long have you worked here?

27:37.406 --> 27:38.990
Since the dawn of man.

27:38.991 --> 27:42.486
Rita, bring me those checks.

27:52.546 --> 27:56.507
My friend disappeared between
Mount St. Helene and Seattle.

27:56.508 --> 27:59.331
That's about 60 miles from here.

27:59.720 --> 28:01.337
I know.

28:03.432 --> 28:06.301
What does your friend look like?

28:10.189 --> 28:13.763
I know this is really
crazy, but I think...

28:15.611 --> 28:20.938
If I remembered everyone who
came in, I'd be a freak of nature.

28:21.700 --> 28:23.522
She's beautiful.

28:24.119 --> 28:26.066
Yeah, I know.

28:30.000 --> 28:31.626
What's your name?

28:31.627 --> 28:33.279
Jeff.

28:35.130 --> 28:38.382
- Shit!
- Don't worry about it. It's okay.

28:38.383 --> 28:42.011
I'm not letting you get
into a car like this.

28:42.012 --> 28:45.431
There's a nice, big cot in the back.

28:45.432 --> 28:49.644
- Let me sit for a minute...
- You can't drive like this.

28:49.645 --> 28:53.174
- You should be in bed.
- I'll be all right.

29:24.096 --> 29:25.888
What do you do now?

29:25.889 --> 29:29.267
I was a copywriter,
but I lost my job.

29:29.268 --> 29:31.060
- I'm sorry.
- No.

29:31.061 --> 29:35.690
No, I'm writing a novel.
I couldn't do that if I was still one.

29:35.691 --> 29:37.400
Why don't you take my number?

29:37.401 --> 29:39.151
Don't give it to strangers.

29:39.152 --> 29:43.398
I slept with you,
at least in the same room.

29:44.408 --> 29:49.036
- That bed killed my back.
- Give me your arm. Turn around.

29:49.037 --> 29:51.986
- What are you doing?
- Just relax, here.

29:53.583 --> 29:56.657
Did it crack? Is it better?

30:12.436 --> 30:14.509
I gotta clear more space.

30:16.523 --> 30:18.596
Look what I found.

30:22.029 --> 30:27.074
Why don't you talk about her anymore?
She was the No. 1 topic.

30:27.075 --> 30:32.288
What's the point? To get upset?
To wind up all frustrated?

30:32.289 --> 30:37.866
- It's weird how things just fade away.
- It's not faded.

30:38.545 --> 30:41.118
Your stuff is in the top drawer.

30:41.923 --> 30:45.676
What's in those boxes?
More crossword puzzles?

30:45.677 --> 30:50.556
Those aren't crossword puzzles.
They're anagrams.

30:50.557 --> 30:53.351
Oh, anagrams.
That's really important.

30:53.352 --> 30:58.439
It's mostly old stuff.
Just high school yearbooks.

30:58.440 --> 31:01.942
- Really? Where? I wanna see.
- Now?

31:01.943 --> 31:07.770
We have some unfinished business.
Don't go through my stuff. Rita!

31:08.533 --> 31:10.284
- You okay?
- No.

31:10.285 --> 31:15.441
- What is this? It almost killed me.
- It's nothing.

31:15.540 --> 31:17.692
It's for protection.

31:18.668 --> 31:21.537
There's a lot of psychos around.

31:21.546 --> 31:23.214
It's loaded.

31:23.215 --> 31:26.869
That's usually what psychos
respond to, honey.

31:28.804 --> 31:31.764
Why didn't you tell me we have a gun?

31:31.765 --> 31:35.768
You just moved in. You also
have to bang on the faucet.

31:35.769 --> 31:39.173
Let's get one thing straight, okay?

31:40.273 --> 31:43.984
No secrets, Jeff.
In the heart, on the lips.

31:43.985 --> 31:45.682
Rita, I need it.

31:56.706 --> 31:58.278
Fine.

32:02.754 --> 32:04.451
Thank you.

32:05.215 --> 32:09.040
Come on. No more secrets,
I promise, okay?

32:10.554 --> 32:15.683
One night when you're asleep,
I'm going to chuck that gun.

32:19.187 --> 32:20.521
I'm sorry.

32:20.522 --> 32:23.607
<i>This is for Jeff Harriman.
It's Arthur Bernard.</i>

32:23.608 --> 32:27.103
- On a Sunday night?
- Who's he?

32:27.529 --> 32:29.822
A publisher. I gave him my book.

32:29.823 --> 32:32.575
- Wait!
- One sec. Hold on.

32:32.576 --> 32:35.077
<i>I need to talk to you.</i>

32:35.078 --> 32:39.233
Hello? Arthur. Yes, Jeff Harriman.

32:40.959 --> 32:44.909
I'm sorry, Jeff.
I'm afraid it's not for us.

32:45.755 --> 32:49.785
But it's very good. Very talented.

32:50.010 --> 32:52.083
I see.

32:53.096 --> 32:55.498
Don't look so destroyed.

32:55.807 --> 32:59.461
We'd like you to write
something else for us.

33:00.520 --> 33:03.764
- Like an assignment?
- Exactly.

33:05.150 --> 33:07.518
That would be great.

33:07.694 --> 33:12.490
I remember when your girlfriend's
disappearance was in the news.

33:12.491 --> 33:14.188
That was terrible.

33:14.493 --> 33:19.444
I was in Tacoma at a wedding,
and I saw your posters.

33:19.831 --> 33:24.361
I'd forgotten all about it,
but you're still looking.

33:26.087 --> 33:30.412
- Yes, I am.
- I want your story, Jeff.

33:31.176 --> 33:32.953
The whole thing.

33:34.721 --> 33:36.589
What do you say?

33:43.230 --> 33:44.802
I've...

33:46.024 --> 33:49.143
I've been trying to
put that behind me.

33:58.995 --> 34:02.774
Oh, I'm sorry. What happened?

34:04.167 --> 34:07.336
I'm gonna be able to
pay the rent now.

34:07.337 --> 34:09.797
- He liked it?
- He loved it.

34:09.797 --> 34:12.451
That's great! That's great!

34:12.717 --> 34:15.370
- Let's go celebrate.
- Okay.

35:06.021 --> 35:11.143
It's about us, isn't it?
You can tell me. I don't mind.

35:12.193 --> 35:14.061
Let's go to bed.

35:38.637 --> 35:42.132
Excuse me. How much is that uniform?

35:50.106 --> 35:52.053
What time is it?

35:53.068 --> 35:55.061
Seven o'clock.

35:59.282 --> 36:00.729
You have to go?

36:01.076 --> 36:03.695
It's only one weekend a month.

36:03.912 --> 36:06.205
Does your mom know you joined?

36:06.206 --> 36:08.279
She filled out the application.

36:09.000 --> 36:13.701
Go back to sleep.
See you tomorrow night.

36:30.897 --> 36:34.608
Welcome to Channel 7 News Check.
I'm Paul McGraw.

36:34.609 --> 36:39.697
Tonight my guest is the courageous
and tormented Jeff Harriman.

36:39.698 --> 36:42.521
- Welcome to our show.
- Thank you.

36:42.701 --> 36:46.412
<i>In the years Diane's been
missing, any new clues?</i>

36:46.413 --> 36:49.498
<i>Have the kidnappers made any contact?</i>

36:49.499 --> 36:51.125
<i>No, not at all.</i>

36:51.126 --> 36:55.546
<i>And yet here you sit, year after
year, trying to find her.</i>

36:55.547 --> 36:58.757
<i>At least to find out what happened.</i>

36:58.758 --> 37:01.593
<i>That must've cost a lot of money.</i>

37:01.594 --> 37:03.554
<i>Pretty much everything I have.</i>

37:03.555 --> 37:07.433
<i>Let's just say the
kidnapper is watching.</i>

37:07.434 --> 37:10.963
<i>Anything you'd like
to say to him now?</i>

37:12.272 --> 37:14.470
<i>I want to meet you.</i>

37:14.649 --> 37:19.145
<i>I don't hate you. I just wanna
know what happened to her.</i>

37:19.821 --> 37:24.476
<i>I'm prepared to do anything
to find out. Please.</i>

37:24.492 --> 37:26.644
<i>I need to know.</i>

37:27.036 --> 37:28.688
There.

37:42.761 --> 37:45.084
Measure on the bench.

37:47.098 --> 37:48.841
Goggles.

37:50.018 --> 37:52.341
Don't you value your eyes?

37:52.687 --> 37:56.011
All right, gather around, please.

37:57.275 --> 38:01.270
The greatest risk the
research chemist faces...

38:02.030 --> 38:06.241
is that a contaminant
is introduced...

38:06.242 --> 38:08.815
into the experiment...

38:09.037 --> 38:14.489
without his knowledge, rendering
the experiment pointless.

39:55.560 --> 39:59.214
Rita Baker.

41:29.570 --> 41:34.726
"Once upon a time, in a wood,
there lived a finch named Kiki.

41:35.952 --> 41:39.287
With her raccoon friends,
Pop and Reba...

41:39.288 --> 41:43.534
she went to find the
source of the river."

41:44.293 --> 41:48.288
A children's book.
Lulu the alligator. Lavender.

42:03.146 --> 42:05.264
Oh, my God!

42:52.570 --> 42:54.517
Room service.

42:58.117 --> 43:01.691
Open up. The guy at the
desk said you're here.

43:16.803 --> 43:18.955
Is this what you want?

43:20.431 --> 43:22.516
- Take it off.
- Why?

43:22.517 --> 43:26.853
I believe in giving my man
what he wants. You know what?

43:26.854 --> 43:30.065
Call me Diane.
I'll treat you like shit.

43:30.066 --> 43:32.192
Then I'll disappear!

43:32.193 --> 43:34.015
Take it off!

43:44.872 --> 43:46.945
Oh, my God!

43:52.338 --> 43:56.883
No secrets? Remember, Jeff?
No secrets!

43:56.884 --> 44:00.971
I knew I could never
make you understand.

44:00.972 --> 44:02.715
Who are you?

44:02.849 --> 44:05.433
You tell me the truth!

44:05.434 --> 44:08.895
Did you know what you were
doing when you went...

44:08.896 --> 44:14.067
from crying to waking up in a
sweat from dreaming about her?

44:14.068 --> 44:18.864
Mentioning her less and taking
her picture off the night table...

44:18.865 --> 44:23.410
and putting mine there?
Dancing on the balcony?

44:23.411 --> 44:27.706
Was the whole thing planned
just to throw me off?

44:27.707 --> 44:32.711
- I didn't wanna lose you!
- You're still in love with her!

44:32.712 --> 44:34.705
I'm in love with you.

44:36.716 --> 44:39.118
What are you saying?

44:39.510 --> 44:43.638
I may not be as smart as you,
but I'm not a dumb bitch.

44:43.639 --> 44:47.893
- Look at this room!
- No pictures except for the posters!

44:47.894 --> 44:51.844
No mementos, just this!
I love you, Rita!

44:55.776 --> 44:58.725
I cracked the code, Jeff.

44:59.071 --> 45:01.473
I saw the book.

45:03.326 --> 45:05.319
You're a liar.

45:11.417 --> 45:14.836
I tried not to come.
I almost went back home...

45:14.837 --> 45:17.756
but if I did, I'd just
pack up and go.

45:17.757 --> 45:19.249
Why didn't you?

45:25.097 --> 45:28.350
Because I don't know
how not to fight.

45:28.351 --> 45:31.519
Nobody in my family ever
fought for anything.

45:31.520 --> 45:34.814
They wound up on Prozac
and sleeping all day...

45:34.815 --> 45:37.525
or dead from liver disease at 35.

45:37.526 --> 45:40.820
That's not gonna happen
to me, Jeff. I fight!

45:40.821 --> 45:43.269
It's not her, Rita.

45:43.783 --> 45:46.701
It hasn't been for a very long time.

45:46.702 --> 45:48.194
Then what is it?

45:48.955 --> 45:52.029
It's it. It's not knowing.

45:52.667 --> 45:56.378
You know what I do?
I pretend I have a choice.

45:56.379 --> 46:00.784
Either to let her go on
living wherever she is...

46:00.925 --> 46:03.134
and never know what happened...

46:03.135 --> 46:08.211
or she can be dead, and I
get to find out everything.

46:09.642 --> 46:11.840
So I let her die.

46:12.645 --> 46:16.147
I swear to God, I wish she were dead.

46:16.148 --> 46:19.518
You don't know what
it is like to not know.

46:22.154 --> 46:23.897
Shit.

46:32.832 --> 46:37.408
I'm sorry. But I don't
know what to do.

46:41.132 --> 46:43.034
I do.

46:46.262 --> 46:49.381
I haven't been to the
gas station since.

46:49.890 --> 46:53.018
I sent the manager posters.
He put them up.

46:53.019 --> 46:54.811
I never went back myself.

46:54.812 --> 46:56.805
Then it's time you did.

47:14.498 --> 47:16.366
Come on.

47:57.750 --> 48:00.244
<i>Till death do us part.</i>

48:23.526 --> 48:26.930
She's gone, Jeff. Gone.

48:27.822 --> 48:32.102
You may never find out how or why.
You have to accept that.

48:34.161 --> 48:36.621
If Diane were here right now...

48:36.622 --> 48:41.027
I'd ask you to marry me.
It's you I love, I swear.

48:41.127 --> 48:44.587
But if it were possible
to choose right now...

48:44.588 --> 48:48.299
I'd rather be back
at this gas station...

48:48.300 --> 48:50.953
so I'd find out what happened.

48:51.929 --> 48:54.002
It's not good enough.

48:55.391 --> 48:58.435
If you ever wanna move
on with your life...

48:58.436 --> 49:01.729
if you wanna be just alive again...

49:01.730 --> 49:05.608
then this is your last chance.
I love you...

49:05.609 --> 49:09.684
but you must decide to
be with me, or I'm gone.

49:10.698 --> 49:12.566
Let her go, Jeff.

49:14.243 --> 49:15.895
Let her go.

49:17.079 --> 49:18.776
Diane.

50:28.359 --> 50:31.638
"Meet me alone...

50:32.905 --> 50:35.228
at the yacht club."

51:00.558 --> 51:02.426
Hey.

51:03.602 --> 51:05.254
Read it.

51:05.604 --> 51:07.347
Go on. Come on.

51:19.785 --> 51:22.279
He's watching me. I can feel it.

51:24.331 --> 51:26.791
My fear was that he was dead.

51:26.792 --> 51:30.992
But there are things in this
letter only he could know.

51:34.133 --> 51:39.137
Jeff, he's seen your
picture in the paper.

51:39.138 --> 51:42.849
He wants to see how far you'll go.
He's loving this.

51:42.850 --> 51:45.351
No, look. He signed it. Barney.

51:45.352 --> 51:49.973
- You think that's his real name?
- That's not the point.

51:51.692 --> 51:53.685
You're right.

51:54.445 --> 51:59.532
The point is, what am I doing here?
It's never gonna change.

51:59.533 --> 52:02.785
It'll just go on until
you end up as crazy.

52:02.786 --> 52:05.814
This letter's the
first break I've had.

52:07.124 --> 52:08.750
I can nail this fucker!

52:08.751 --> 52:12.496
Go to the police!
You can't do this on your own!

52:14.381 --> 52:18.957
The police? They laugh at me.
I'm a joke to them.

52:20.095 --> 52:23.749
I'm starting to see their point.

52:23.932 --> 52:29.259
- Don't do this to me, not now!
- Jesus Christ, you are amazing!

52:29.271 --> 52:33.392
Did it occur to you that she
doesn't wanna be found?

52:35.778 --> 52:37.680
Goodbye, Jeff.

52:38.614 --> 52:42.784
Run like a coward. At least
Diane was taken by force.

52:42.785 --> 52:45.279
I am not Diane!

55:23.487 --> 55:27.990
You've reached Jeff Harriman
and his twisted ego.

55:27.991 --> 55:31.244
Rita Baker no longer lives here.
She's left Jeff.

55:31.245 --> 55:35.957
She's moving out, and she
will not be found here again.

55:35.958 --> 55:38.876
So don't look for me, forever.

56:06.613 --> 56:10.616
<i>You reached Jeff Harriman
and Jeff's twisted ego.</i>

56:10.617 --> 56:14.647
<i>Rita Baker no longer lives here.
She has left Jeff.</i>

56:29.511 --> 56:32.334
Rita! Rita?

56:35.100 --> 56:37.252
Oh, shit.

56:56.288 --> 57:00.291
Hi, you've reached 555-8767.
Please leave a message.

57:00.292 --> 57:02.319
Hello, Jeff.

57:05.464 --> 57:09.585
I'm the man you're looking for.
I'm Barney.

57:24.691 --> 57:27.389
Son of a bitch!

57:27.778 --> 57:30.522
What did you do with her?

57:31.114 --> 57:34.142
Where is she?
What did you do with her?

57:42.918 --> 57:44.444
Tell me!

57:48.840 --> 57:51.163
Where is she, Barney?

58:13.073 --> 58:17.273
Kill me if you want.
You have every right.

58:17.577 --> 58:20.150
Beat me to a bloody pulp.

58:22.582 --> 58:26.407
But if I die, you'll never know.

58:29.631 --> 58:33.926
- I'm sorry. Were you done?
- Tell me where she is!

58:33.927 --> 58:37.831
There's only one way
for you to find out.

58:39.891 --> 58:42.293
- How?
- One.

58:42.769 --> 58:44.386
How?

58:47.149 --> 58:49.096
Come with me.

58:50.777 --> 58:52.429
Where?

58:52.696 --> 58:55.519
In my car for a drive.

58:57.701 --> 58:59.694
To where? Diane?

59:03.206 --> 59:05.108
Come with me.

59:09.463 --> 59:11.581
Tell me, is she dead?

59:12.799 --> 59:16.886
I'm offering you this one chance...

59:16.887 --> 59:19.130
to find out everything.

59:21.683 --> 59:25.713
I warn you, I've taken precautions.

59:26.063 --> 59:30.513
If anything happens to me,
or if you speak to anyone...

59:31.401 --> 59:34.054
you'll never know what happened.

59:36.656 --> 59:38.979
I'm leaving now...

59:39.701 --> 59:42.775
with or without you.

01:00:20.784 --> 01:00:24.734
I'll go with you,
but you take me to Diane!

01:01:14.379 --> 01:01:16.156
Shit!

01:01:19.384 --> 01:01:21.536
He'd be such a great guy.

01:01:22.262 --> 01:01:25.336
If he wasn't monumentally fucked up.

01:01:26.641 --> 01:01:29.351
Lynn, come here, come here.

01:01:29.352 --> 01:01:33.147
I hope he hasn't changed it.
Listen to the message.

01:01:33.148 --> 01:01:35.926
<i>- You've reached...</i>
- He changed it.

01:01:39.946 --> 01:01:43.020
- Leave him a message!
- Wait a minute.

01:01:44.201 --> 01:01:46.228
<i>Hello, Jeff.</i>

01:01:48.288 --> 01:01:51.373
- What?
<i>- I'm who you're looking for.</i>

01:01:51.374 --> 01:01:54.027
- Oh, my God!
<i>- I'm Barney.</i>

01:01:54.377 --> 01:01:57.405
- What?
- Oh, my God!

01:02:14.105 --> 01:02:15.552
Hungry?

01:02:35.669 --> 01:02:38.572
I hope you like roast beef.

01:02:41.883 --> 01:02:45.002
I've thought a lot about meeting you.

01:02:45.178 --> 01:02:50.926
- I've wanted to right from the start.
- Did you rape her?

01:02:51.601 --> 01:02:56.313
I'm not a rapist. It's important
that you understand that.

01:02:56.314 --> 01:02:58.261
Then what did you do to her?

01:03:01.653 --> 01:03:03.976
Let me tell you a story.

01:03:04.531 --> 01:03:07.866
When I was 15,
it was an ordinary day...

01:03:07.867 --> 01:03:12.454
I don't wanna hear your damn story.
I couldn't give a shit.

01:03:12.455 --> 01:03:14.915
I wanna know what happened to her.

01:03:14.916 --> 01:03:17.944
Then you'll want to
listen to the story.

01:03:19.045 --> 01:03:21.868
You want to listen carefully.

01:03:22.632 --> 01:03:26.161
Sometimes the devil
is in the details.

01:03:28.471 --> 01:03:31.499
Now, once, when I was 15...

01:03:32.309 --> 01:03:34.727
it was an ordinary day...

01:03:34.728 --> 01:03:38.632
<i>with my ordinary home
and my ordinary life.</i>

01:03:40.900 --> 01:03:44.930
<i>Something willed me to
the edge of the balcony.</i>

01:03:46.406 --> 01:03:51.152
<i>I wondered if I had
the courage to jump.</i>

01:03:52.537 --> 01:03:57.283
<i>I kept waiting for something
to stop me. Anything.</i>

01:03:58.084 --> 01:04:00.282
<i>But nothing did.</i>

01:04:03.340 --> 01:04:05.617
<i>And so I jumped.</i>

01:04:09.971 --> 01:04:15.434
Everybody has had that thought
at one time, but I did it. Why?

01:04:15.435 --> 01:04:19.605
Because you're a nut case.
I wanna know where Diane is!

01:04:19.606 --> 01:04:21.899
You're still not listening.

01:04:21.900 --> 01:04:25.402
Be careful.
The answer will slip by you.

01:04:25.403 --> 01:04:26.904
Go on.

01:04:26.905 --> 01:04:30.991
I lead a very normal life.
I work. I have a home.

01:04:30.992 --> 01:04:33.235
But then, one day...

01:04:33.328 --> 01:04:37.449
on vacation with my
family in California...

01:04:38.750 --> 01:04:41.418
There's a little girl in the water!

01:04:41.419 --> 01:04:43.992
Hurry! She's drowning!

01:04:50.678 --> 01:04:52.751
Wow!

01:04:55.016 --> 01:04:59.311
<i>I jumped in without thinking,
just like when I was 15.</i>

01:04:59.312 --> 01:05:02.090
<i>Once again, nothing stopped me.</i>

01:05:02.190 --> 01:05:07.444
<i>I didn't want to save her. I wanted
to be a hero for my daughter.</i>

01:05:07.445 --> 01:05:11.019
You're the bravest man in the world.

01:05:11.074 --> 01:05:13.397
I love you, Daddy.

01:05:14.702 --> 01:05:18.197
In that moment,
she thought I was a god.

01:05:20.708 --> 01:05:25.337
That would make most people
feel great, but I panicked.

01:05:25.338 --> 01:05:30.494
- What does this have to do with Diane?
- Diane was an experiment.

01:05:32.011 --> 01:05:37.383
Saving a life made me a hero,
but did it make me a good person?

01:05:37.851 --> 01:05:41.645
I had to prove to myself
beyond a doubt...

01:05:41.646 --> 01:05:46.817
that I was as capable of
evil as I was of heroism.

01:05:46.818 --> 01:05:48.765
Real evil.

01:05:49.988 --> 01:05:54.616
The worst thing. Or I wouldn't
deserve my daughter's love.

01:05:54.617 --> 01:05:56.815
You're fucking insane.

01:05:59.330 --> 01:06:00.831
You killed Diane.

01:06:00.832 --> 01:06:06.079
For me, to kill is not the worst
thing that I could imagine.

01:06:07.922 --> 01:06:10.745
There's more to know.

01:06:21.436 --> 01:06:24.589
Tell me what happened.
I won't say a word.

01:06:25.273 --> 01:06:29.723
You won't because if you do
you won't get what you need.

01:06:37.118 --> 01:06:42.740
- Something wrong, officer?
- You have a broken taillight.

01:06:45.835 --> 01:06:50.631
I don't know what to say.
There's nothing criminal on the tape.

01:06:50.632 --> 01:06:55.511
We'll conduct a search, but he
has to be missing 24 hours first.

01:06:55.512 --> 01:06:57.971
Twenty-four hours? Jesus!

01:06:57.972 --> 01:07:01.975
What is this? Gotta give
out parking tickets first?

01:07:01.976 --> 01:07:03.602
Lynn, please.

01:07:03.603 --> 01:07:05.687
How much have you had to drink?

01:07:05.688 --> 01:07:09.638
One after another.

01:07:11.569 --> 01:07:13.654
Get that taillight fixed.

01:07:13.655 --> 01:07:16.323
Yes, officer. Will do. Thank you.

01:07:16.324 --> 01:07:18.146
Drive safely.

01:07:25.583 --> 01:07:27.960
- Problem?
- Your seat belt.

01:07:27.961 --> 01:07:32.241
- I'm claustrophobic.
- Just put it on.

01:07:32.507 --> 01:07:34.033
Yes, sir.

01:08:13.715 --> 01:08:18.051
Miss Carmichael? It's Rita!
Are you there?

01:08:18.051 --> 01:08:21.638
Please come to the door!
I need to talk to you!

01:08:21.639 --> 01:08:23.015
Magically delicious.

01:08:23.015 --> 01:08:26.795
Miss Carmichael!
Can you come to the door?

01:08:26.894 --> 01:08:29.938
What's the ruckus?
You're gonna wake Elvis.

01:08:29.939 --> 01:08:33.969
Great. Miss Carmichael,
this is very important.

01:08:35.444 --> 01:08:40.145
Did you see Jeff here today?
Did you see anything unusual?

01:08:40.783 --> 01:08:44.661
- You mean the fight with Barney?
- Yes!

01:08:44.662 --> 01:08:47.109
What fight? Tell me about it.

01:08:47.247 --> 01:08:49.399
Nothing to tell.

01:08:49.959 --> 01:08:53.670
Your boyfriend was whopping
that man's head...

01:08:53.671 --> 01:08:56.756
got in the car with
him and drove off.

01:08:56.758 --> 01:08:58.175
Oh, God!

01:08:58.176 --> 01:09:02.581
Okay, what else? Do you
remember anything else?

01:09:03.473 --> 01:09:05.932
Yes, come to think of it, I do.

01:09:05.933 --> 01:09:09.428
- Something odd.
- What?

01:09:09.437 --> 01:09:11.854
In the middle of everything...

01:09:11.856 --> 01:09:16.151
that leprechaun popped
off my Lucky Charms box...

01:09:16.152 --> 01:09:18.930
and started dancing around.

01:09:19.529 --> 01:09:22.649
"Magically delicious!"

01:09:23.785 --> 01:09:25.653
Thank you.

01:09:26.162 --> 01:09:31.582
If you wanna know the license plate
number of the car, let me know.

01:09:31.584 --> 01:09:33.531
Wait, wait, wait.

01:09:33.961 --> 01:09:37.706
It's very urgent. Please!
I'll be one minute.

01:09:37.756 --> 01:09:41.036
One minute. Please? Thanks.

01:09:41.636 --> 01:09:46.473
- Sir! Sir, my car was stolen.
- Your car was stolen?

01:09:46.474 --> 01:09:51.801
The license plate is 155INY.
I've already been to the police.

01:10:06.327 --> 01:10:09.230
Mrs. Cousins? Helene Cousins?

01:10:11.082 --> 01:10:12.916
Yes...

01:10:12.917 --> 01:10:15.536
You may still have my old address.

01:10:18.840 --> 01:10:21.618
1804 Northwest Everett Drive.

01:10:23.344 --> 01:10:26.430
- Seattle.
- New one. Thanks.

01:10:26.431 --> 01:10:28.799
You gotta fill out this form.

01:10:41.696 --> 01:10:44.156
I was having no success.

01:10:44.157 --> 01:10:46.950
My methods needed to be rethought.

01:10:46.951 --> 01:10:48.618
And then...

01:10:48.619 --> 01:10:53.320
my family gave me a little
party on my birthday.

01:10:54.834 --> 01:10:57.077
Okay, move in.

01:10:57.503 --> 01:11:00.406
Right, little closer.

01:11:04.594 --> 01:11:06.371
Smile!

01:11:07.388 --> 01:11:09.765
- Happy birthday.
- Happy birthday, Barney.

01:11:09.766 --> 01:11:12.089
Blow out the candles, Daddy.

01:11:32.580 --> 01:11:34.152
Thank you.

01:11:35.041 --> 01:11:36.909
Forever.

01:11:38.669 --> 01:11:40.537
More?

01:11:55.603 --> 01:11:58.677
I'm afraid to open it.

01:11:58.731 --> 01:12:00.553
Let's see.

01:12:03.361 --> 01:12:05.684
What happened to me?

01:12:19.877 --> 01:12:24.248
- What happened, Daddy?
- You fell off the balcony.

01:12:26.175 --> 01:12:28.873
<i>And that's when it dawned on me.</i>

01:12:29.303 --> 01:12:35.130
<i>It wasn't the lure that had to
be stronger. I had to be weaker.</i>

01:12:47.196 --> 01:12:49.064
Excuse me.

01:12:51.659 --> 01:12:56.288
I've opened mine with a
barrette a million times.

01:12:56.289 --> 01:12:59.283
- This way?
- Yes.

01:13:25.985 --> 01:13:27.932
Bless you.

01:13:30.489 --> 01:13:35.861
Excuse me. I have to go to the
men's room. I don't feel so well.

01:13:56.390 --> 01:13:58.850
I'd given up for the day.

01:13:58.851 --> 01:14:00.727
It was comical.

01:14:00.728 --> 01:14:04.177
I didn't trust myself not
to laugh the next time.

01:14:34.887 --> 01:14:36.721
<i>Fate, Jeff.</i>

01:14:36.722 --> 01:14:39.216
<i>If I hadn't sneezed...</i>

01:14:53.739 --> 01:14:56.116
- I'm sorry.
- Quite all right.

01:14:56.117 --> 01:15:00.147
I was just wondering if
you had five singles.

01:15:04.583 --> 01:15:05.834
Three ones.

01:15:05.835 --> 01:15:11.583
Just a normal single you could trade
me for my mangled one. Thank you.

01:15:12.383 --> 01:15:13.909
Could you...?

01:15:14.260 --> 01:15:15.752
Sorry.

01:15:16.012 --> 01:15:17.584
Thank you.

01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:21.084
Okay, now let's see if this works.

01:15:23.185 --> 01:15:26.259
This is your lucky day.
I can feel it.

01:15:28.774 --> 01:15:30.517
Thank you.

01:15:31.110 --> 01:15:32.944
That's a beautiful bracelet.

01:15:32.945 --> 01:15:36.690
Thank you. That's the
symbol for infinity.

01:15:37.074 --> 01:15:40.368
I suppose it means
it'll stay forever.

01:15:40.369 --> 01:15:43.147
Well, it's a nice thought.

01:15:43.914 --> 01:15:49.044
My boyfriend would really
appreciate something like that.

01:15:49.045 --> 01:15:51.573
Where'd you get that?

01:15:53.966 --> 01:15:55.834
I rep them.

01:15:56.218 --> 01:16:00.013
I handle sales for the
whole Northwest Territory.

01:16:00.014 --> 01:16:01.389
Wow!

01:16:01.390 --> 01:16:06.512
If you promise not to tell the
next time you're in Paris...

01:16:06.937 --> 01:16:10.273
I'll let you have a sample for cost.

01:16:10.274 --> 01:16:13.644
- They're in my car.
- Really?

01:16:13.819 --> 01:16:15.653
With a new product...

01:16:15.654 --> 01:16:20.776
it's a good idea to have people
seen wearing it around town.

01:16:21.452 --> 01:16:25.205
- Twenty-two bucks.
- That's cheap.

01:16:25.206 --> 01:16:30.703
If I told you the markup we get for
these, you'd die. You want one?

01:16:33.130 --> 01:16:34.577
Yes.

01:16:35.674 --> 01:16:37.667
Right this way.

01:17:00.866 --> 01:17:02.813
There they are.

01:17:02.952 --> 01:17:04.569
Please.

01:17:05.746 --> 01:17:07.914
They're called "tiles" in French?

01:17:07.915 --> 01:17:12.695
That's the name of
the company. <i>Teels.</i>

01:17:13.963 --> 01:17:17.082
<i>Un tile</i> infinity, please.

01:17:19.218 --> 01:17:22.087
Could you get in and give me a hand?

01:17:22.471 --> 01:17:25.374
- Get in?
- Yes.

01:18:26.785 --> 01:18:29.529
Why did you make contact with me?

01:18:32.374 --> 01:18:34.617
Because you asked.

01:18:35.961 --> 01:18:39.410
The way you searched for Diane.

01:18:40.257 --> 01:18:42.884
Such a worthy opponent.

01:18:42.885 --> 01:18:45.208
A kindred spirit.

01:18:47.056 --> 01:18:52.132
You don't meet many men who
refuse to give up or be dominated.

01:18:52.144 --> 01:18:55.263
Most just crouch
frightened in the dark.

01:19:01.820 --> 01:19:03.571
Excuse me.

01:19:03.572 --> 01:19:08.478
I'm looking for Mr. Cousins.
I saw you come out of his house.

01:19:11.622 --> 01:19:14.116
I know who you are.

01:19:14.458 --> 01:19:15.950
You do?

01:19:17.086 --> 01:19:20.672
Yeah, I saw him watching
you this afternoon...

01:19:20.673 --> 01:19:22.746
at the restaurant.

01:19:23.259 --> 01:19:25.457
Come in out of the damp.

01:19:34.103 --> 01:19:35.846
I'm Rita.

01:19:38.274 --> 01:19:40.142
I'm Denise.

01:19:42.194 --> 01:19:44.847
Are you going to run away together?

01:19:46.532 --> 01:19:47.979
Um...

01:19:49.451 --> 01:19:52.354
It's complicated.

01:19:54.623 --> 01:19:56.445
Where is he now?

01:19:56.792 --> 01:20:01.823
- At the cabin.
- The cabin? I forgot.

01:20:03.882 --> 01:20:06.831
Don't you wanna be together forever?

01:20:12.766 --> 01:20:15.393
That's the symbol for infinity.

01:20:15.394 --> 01:20:19.897
I gave it to him on a
bracelet for his birthday.

01:20:19.898 --> 01:20:22.025
Look, I wanna go to him now.

01:20:22.026 --> 01:20:26.181
But I'm not sure I can
find my way. It's dark.

01:20:26.572 --> 01:20:28.440
Can you tell me the way?

01:20:29.658 --> 01:20:32.857
Come on. You can drop
me off on the way.

01:20:33.037 --> 01:20:37.408
I'm meeting a boy. Daddy has no idea.

01:20:37.791 --> 01:20:43.288
Mother's asleep. Daddy says
romance has to be secret.

01:20:44.673 --> 01:20:48.828
- You won't tell him, will you?
- No, I won't tell him.

01:20:51.680 --> 01:20:54.223
I wanna know what you did with her.

01:20:54.224 --> 01:20:56.092
I'll tell you.

01:20:56.310 --> 01:20:58.712
I will keep my promise.

01:20:59.146 --> 01:21:01.890
But there's only one way to do it.

01:21:03.025 --> 01:21:06.554
You must experience
what she experienced.

01:21:07.112 --> 01:21:08.855
What do you mean?

01:21:09.281 --> 01:21:14.482
Everything that happened to her,
every event from this point on...

01:21:14.536 --> 01:21:17.155
you must duplicate exactly.

01:21:17.247 --> 01:21:18.706
You're crazy.

01:21:18.707 --> 01:21:22.126
If you do, logic dictates
you'll find her.

01:21:22.127 --> 01:21:23.653
Alive?

01:21:26.882 --> 01:21:29.535
This coffee is drugged.

01:21:31.220 --> 01:21:33.596
Judging from your size...

01:21:33.597 --> 01:21:37.016
it would take 15 minutes
to take effect.

01:21:37.017 --> 01:21:40.512
It'll put you out for
40 minutes or so...

01:21:40.854 --> 01:21:43.973
the same length of
time Diane was out.

01:21:44.858 --> 01:21:48.762
You must remain unconscious
for us to move on.

01:21:50.072 --> 01:21:52.019
So she's not dead?

01:21:52.366 --> 01:21:53.938
Drink.

01:21:54.618 --> 01:21:56.736
And afterwards, what?

01:21:56.870 --> 01:22:01.446
Drink and you will experience
exactly what she experienced.

01:22:19.893 --> 01:22:24.939
You don't understand. I won't
tell anyone. I just want to know.

01:22:24.940 --> 01:22:27.013
I understand.

01:22:27.234 --> 01:22:31.309
And when I put myself in
your place, I believe you.

01:22:32.030 --> 01:22:34.649
That's why I don't need a gun.

01:22:35.242 --> 01:22:38.065
Your obsession is my weapon.

01:22:39.163 --> 01:22:41.831
It's like you are my laboratory rat.

01:22:41.832 --> 01:22:45.406
I provided the materials.
You've built the cage.

01:22:45.502 --> 01:22:49.702
Only now, you can't escape
what you've constructed.

01:22:51.508 --> 01:22:55.253
If you want to know
what happened to her...

01:22:55.846 --> 01:22:59.250
you have to go through
the same things.

01:23:07.608 --> 01:23:10.602
The key chain,
I'd like to see it again.

01:23:24.082 --> 01:23:29.909
Jeff, look at your life.
You have nothing. No job.

01:23:30.547 --> 01:23:32.494
No money.

01:23:33.800 --> 01:23:35.747
No love.

01:23:37.804 --> 01:23:40.127
No peace of mind.

01:23:42.601 --> 01:23:45.228
It's been three years of hell.

01:23:45.229 --> 01:23:50.483
At what point do you say,
"I'm not going to be over this"?

01:23:50.484 --> 01:23:56.072
There were nights with Diane I'd
pray she'd get into an accident...

01:23:56.073 --> 01:23:59.325
just so she'd let me
take care of her.

01:23:59.326 --> 01:24:02.479
Just so she'd have to stay with me.

01:24:03.372 --> 01:24:06.082
You don't care if
she's alive or dead.

01:24:06.083 --> 01:24:07.375
I do.

01:24:07.376 --> 01:24:11.796
You're afraid that you
won't know who you are.

01:24:11.797 --> 01:24:15.591
Who is Jeff if he's not the
guy looking for Diane?

01:24:15.592 --> 01:24:17.414
Please.

01:24:18.178 --> 01:24:21.957
Can you walk away from
knowing the answer?

01:24:23.850 --> 01:24:27.937
Please, I just wanna know
what happened to her.

01:24:27.938 --> 01:24:32.684
Drink, Jeff, really.
What choice do you have?

01:25:21.992 --> 01:25:25.703
I said I'd show you what
happened to Diane...

01:25:25.704 --> 01:25:28.573
and I'm a man of my word.

01:25:41.303 --> 01:25:43.580
No!

01:26:38.402 --> 01:26:40.725
Help!

01:26:54.376 --> 01:26:56.574
Diane.

01:29:03.213 --> 01:29:04.660
Oh, shit!

01:29:06.299 --> 01:29:08.201
Hello, Rita.

01:29:08.635 --> 01:29:11.333
I really dislike surprises.

01:29:52.554 --> 01:29:54.251
Rita?

01:29:55.056 --> 01:29:57.925
It's me! Come out.

01:29:59.811 --> 01:30:02.464
You can't possibly win.

01:30:03.440 --> 01:30:05.683
You don't know how.

01:30:06.151 --> 01:30:08.804
Your hiding is pointless.

01:30:10.864 --> 01:30:14.063
I know these woods inside and out.

01:30:15.660 --> 01:30:17.687
They're like a maze.

01:30:20.749 --> 01:30:25.245
You must come out if
you want to find Jeff!

01:30:25.295 --> 01:30:28.414
That's why you came, after all.

01:31:10.966 --> 01:31:12.675
Where's Jeff?

01:31:12.676 --> 01:31:14.578
Where?

01:31:15.595 --> 01:31:19.723
Do what you want.
You'll never know what happened.

01:31:19.724 --> 01:31:25.005
If anything happens to me, all you'll
have is your same uncertainty.

01:31:26.690 --> 01:31:31.391
- Your choice.
- I'll take my chances.

01:31:42.330 --> 01:31:44.573
Jeff?!

01:31:58.013 --> 01:31:59.790
Jeff!

01:32:02.308 --> 01:32:05.006
Jeff, are you here?

01:32:07.814 --> 01:32:09.773
Jeff!

01:32:09.774 --> 01:32:11.676
Jeff!

01:32:30.962 --> 01:32:32.955
Jeff!

01:32:51.399 --> 01:32:52.971
Hello?

01:32:53.401 --> 01:32:55.269
Hello?

01:32:56.279 --> 01:32:57.771
Hello?

01:33:02.035 --> 01:33:04.904
<i>Operator 319. What city, please?</i>

01:33:05.997 --> 01:33:09.651
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

01:33:22.806 --> 01:33:24.924
Feeling strange?

01:33:43.535 --> 01:33:45.812
This is silly, Rita.

01:33:47.831 --> 01:33:49.733
You can't fight.

01:34:43.052 --> 01:34:44.499
No!

01:35:39.734 --> 01:35:41.818
How did you follow us?

01:35:41.819 --> 01:35:43.937
Did you see us leave?

01:35:51.871 --> 01:35:56.526
The important thing is that
it was all Jeff's choice.

01:35:59.045 --> 01:36:02.619
Coming to the restaurant,
getting in the car...

01:36:03.591 --> 01:36:05.789
drinking the coffee.

01:36:06.010 --> 01:36:08.253
He did what he wanted to do.

01:36:12.642 --> 01:36:15.511
You're feeling better, aren't you?

01:36:17.647 --> 01:36:21.275
I know how long the
chloroform effects last.

01:36:21.276 --> 01:36:24.179
You'll soon be strong
enough to fight.

01:36:26.155 --> 01:36:30.025
Well, I'm sorry, but...

01:36:31.786 --> 01:36:34.188
I'm just not up to it.

01:36:34.789 --> 01:36:36.498
And besides...

01:36:36.499 --> 01:36:40.904
I have to get home
before my wife wakes up.

01:36:41.921 --> 01:36:44.494
Tell me what you did to Jeff.

01:36:47.218 --> 01:36:49.916
You took your chances.

01:36:50.471 --> 01:36:52.248
Is he dead?

01:36:52.849 --> 01:36:57.595
I made him a cup of coffee.
It was drugged.

01:37:02.692 --> 01:37:07.939
To find out what happened,
he had to go through what she did.

01:37:10.658 --> 01:37:13.277
And now you must do the same.

01:37:20.209 --> 01:37:24.409
This can be easy,
or this can be hard.

01:37:24.547 --> 01:37:26.620
Your choice.

01:37:32.180 --> 01:37:36.130
Don't worry. It won't keep you up.

01:38:30.029 --> 01:38:34.900
Tell me, Mr. Cousins. Have you
spoken to your daughter tonight?

01:38:36.911 --> 01:38:40.414
What? How do you know my name?

01:38:40.415 --> 01:38:44.418
I know your family's names,
Barney. Wife, Helene.

01:38:44.419 --> 01:38:46.446
Daughter, Denise.

01:38:47.255 --> 01:38:51.626
Sweet, innocent,
13-year-old daughter, Denise.

01:38:51.801 --> 01:38:55.626
Brown hair, full of secrets.

01:38:56.597 --> 01:38:58.294
I've got her.

01:39:03.312 --> 01:39:07.357
What are you up to?
How were you able to follow us?

01:39:07.358 --> 01:39:09.601
Denise knows the way.

01:39:10.361 --> 01:39:14.686
I took your daughter
tonight to trade for Jeff.

01:39:18.161 --> 01:39:22.407
A brave attempt, but we
both know it's not true.

01:39:26.586 --> 01:39:30.839
Let's talk about the mistress
she wants you to have.

01:39:30.840 --> 01:39:33.038
<i>Wuthering Heights.</i>

01:39:35.011 --> 01:39:38.335
Or better yet,
let's talk about infinity.

01:40:24.560 --> 01:40:26.269
Helene, it's me.

01:40:26.270 --> 01:40:29.856
<i>Is Denise with you?
Her bed hasn't been slept in.</i>

01:40:29.857 --> 01:40:34.228
<i>I got up to close the windows
and she wasn't there...</i>

01:40:37.740 --> 01:40:40.142
That's right, shithead.

01:40:41.661 --> 01:40:45.235
Where is she?
What did you do with her?

01:40:46.499 --> 01:40:51.245
If you wanna know, you'll have
to go through what she did.

01:40:53.381 --> 01:40:56.675
- Drink.
- You can't be serious.

01:40:56.676 --> 01:40:58.419
Try me.

01:40:58.803 --> 01:41:00.750
- If you think...
- Drink!

01:41:01.764 --> 01:41:03.381
Now!

01:41:39.051 --> 01:41:40.953
To your health.

01:42:48.663 --> 01:42:51.612
Jeff! God, hold on!

01:43:06.597 --> 01:43:09.091
Jeff, hold on! Hold on!

01:43:27.535 --> 01:43:29.653
Jeff, hold on!

01:43:49.557 --> 01:43:51.675
Oh, Jesus!

01:43:54.729 --> 01:43:57.605
God, be alive! Be alive.

01:43:57.606 --> 01:43:59.349
Be alive!

01:44:02.987 --> 01:44:04.434
Rita?

01:44:08.242 --> 01:44:11.327
I've got 15 minutes
to find her, Rita!

01:44:11.328 --> 01:44:13.788
- Son of a bitch!
- Where is she?

01:44:13.789 --> 01:44:17.000
- You killed him!
- I have no time to mess around!

01:44:17.001 --> 01:44:21.076
- Get off of me! Bastard!
- Tell me where she is!

01:44:21.422 --> 01:44:24.245
- Tell me where she is!
- No!

01:44:25.217 --> 01:44:27.335
Where is she?

01:44:30.723 --> 01:44:32.340
Help!

01:44:38.147 --> 01:44:41.274
I've got 15 minutes
to find her, Rita!

01:44:41.275 --> 01:44:43.097
No, don't!

01:45:21.941 --> 01:45:25.185
It's over. It's over.

01:45:45.923 --> 01:45:48.075
You all right?

01:45:58.894 --> 01:46:02.814
There was a terrific story
there before, but now...

01:46:02.815 --> 01:46:05.843
I think it's an out-and-out smash.

01:46:05.985 --> 01:46:09.612
- I need for you to write it.
- I don't think so.

01:46:09.613 --> 01:46:12.615
We wanna put the
whole thing behind us.

01:46:12.616 --> 01:46:18.068
Look, I know I'm being gauche,
but I'm a publisher.

01:46:19.039 --> 01:46:23.319
Write this book, please.
You won't regret it.

01:46:23.419 --> 01:46:25.196
What do you say?

01:46:26.213 --> 01:46:29.457
- No coffee.
- We don't drink that anymore.
