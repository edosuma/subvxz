01:42.903 --> 01:45.206
everyone who is anyone
is here.

01:45.239 --> 01:47.175
In fact, I can see
the organizer

01:47.208 --> 01:49.710
of this brilliant

01:49.743 --> 01:51.245
Billionaire Bruce Wayne.

to be racing the Man of Steel?

01:56.917 --> 01:58.586
(CHUCKLES) Well...

01:58.619 --> 02:01.755
You know, Miss Lane,
I'm not called the Flash
because I'm slow.

02:01.789 --> 02:03.090
That may be,

02:03.123 --> 02:06.260
but you are aware
that Superman is faster
than a speeding bullet.

02:06.294 --> 02:07.761
Uh, so am I.

02:07.795 --> 02:09.797
Sure you are. Superman!

02:09.830 --> 02:11.665
Lois, you look lovely today.

02:11.699 --> 02:13.501
Did you do something
to your hair?

02:13.534 --> 02:15.769
I guess nothing escapes
your super eyes.
(GIGGLES NERVOUSLY)

02:15.803 --> 02:19.273
As for the race,
I think we both know
how this is going to turn out.

02:19.307 --> 02:21.409
Should I congratulate you
now or later?

02:21.442 --> 02:25.313
Now, Lois, the Flash
is definitely going to give me
a run for my money.

02:25.346 --> 02:26.914
Money for charity, that is.

For the convenience
of our viewing audience,

03:12.493 --> 03:14.862
Superman and the Flash
are wearing GPS devices

03:14.895 --> 03:18.332
which will allow us to show
the real-time progress

Thanks to
your satellite connections,

03:36.617 --> 03:39.720
we are transferring
that energy in record time.

03:39.753 --> 03:45.393
I estimate the batteries
being at full charge
in 19.396 seconds.

03:45.426 --> 03:47.561
You're so exacting, Chronos.

03:47.595 --> 03:50.864
I bet when you were a kid,
you enjoyed algebra.

it controlled time.

04:03.544 --> 04:07.615
Time, speed. They're just
flipsides of the same thing.

04:07.648 --> 04:09.683
Ultimate power!

04:09.717 --> 04:12.052
Now you're speaking
my language.

04:12.085 --> 04:13.554
What are you doing?

04:13.587 --> 04:15.756
We're supposed to be
working together. Why?

06:00.894 --> 06:01.995
How can he be this fast?

06:02.029 --> 06:03.731
He can't. Unless...

06:03.764 --> 06:05.799
He's connected
to the Speed Force.

06:05.833 --> 06:07.000
Speed Force?

06:07.034 --> 06:08.536
It's found between dimensions.

06:08.569 --> 06:10.404
It's how I got
my speed powers.

06:10.438 --> 06:11.739
If Luthor's tapped into it...

with Speed Force.

And it's
total time control, too.

06:18.646 --> 06:20.948
Not only
can I accelerate time...

06:27.721 --> 06:29.923
I can make it stop altogether.

If I can stop time,

06:49.677 --> 06:52.580
I can stop anything
and anyone.

So tell all your buddies
in the caped clown car

06:55.082 --> 06:56.784
to stay out of my lane,

06:56.817 --> 06:59.720
or I'll see to it
that time stops for them.

FLASH: It's not like
you're hitting a rock.

07:44.732 --> 07:47.635
It's a force. What is he
doing in there anyway?

07:47.668 --> 07:49.202
He's stopped time.

07:49.236 --> 07:50.971
Just like out here.

07:51.004 --> 07:52.640
No one moves.

07:52.673 --> 07:53.974
Nothing is working.

07:54.007 --> 07:55.609
Except for
S.T.A.R. Labs' computers.

07:55.643 --> 07:57.511
They're still functioning.

07:57.545 --> 08:00.080
Looks like Luthor's
taking control
of S.T.A.R. Labs' satellites.

08:00.113 --> 08:03.050
And using them to get into
other satellite systems.

08:03.083 --> 08:05.052
Bet you
they're defense satellites.

08:05.085 --> 08:08.121
So he can piggyback
into every missile system
in the world.

08:08.155 --> 08:09.690
Starting with ours.

08:10.257 --> 08:11.559
What makes you say that?

08:11.592 --> 08:12.760
Oh, I don't know.

08:12.793 --> 08:14.628
It's just
every supervillain's plan

08:14.662 --> 08:16.864
in every action movie
ever made.

08:17.665 --> 08:18.732
We gotta get in there.

08:18.766 --> 08:20.100
If I vibrate fast enough,

08:20.133 --> 08:22.836
my molecules can pass through
solid objects.

08:22.870 --> 08:24.872
Maybe I can get through this.

Don't worry, you'll do it.

08:39.319 --> 08:41.054
Found out what's happening.

08:41.822 --> 08:43.290
The belts were rigged.

08:43.323 --> 08:45.125
They were sending
an energy signal
during the race.

08:45.158 --> 08:48.629
I traced it to Luthor's place
on the recorded GPS.

08:48.662 --> 08:50.664
That's where I found him.

08:51.298 --> 08:53.300
Two-timed me, he did!

08:53.333 --> 08:55.035
I remember now.

08:55.068 --> 08:57.738

they can pull the wool
over my eyes.

08:57.771 --> 09:00.073
Well, let me tell you... Uh...

09:00.107 --> 09:02.175
Where are we?

09:02.209 --> 09:05.779
I've reprogrammed the belt
to send its energy signal
directly to Flash's belt.

09:05.813 --> 09:07.581
Here, plug this in.

09:08.248 --> 09:09.650
Then what?

09:09.683 --> 09:11.018
Then run.

you can vibrate
through that time-wall
