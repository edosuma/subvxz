Oh, Schwartz, you are gonna
love this footage.

01:25.418 --> 01:27.128
(CHUCKLES)
Wow.

01:37.305 --> 01:39.015
(GASPS, YELPS)

01:41.309 --> 01:42.935
One bite from that,

01:42.936 --> 01:45.313
the final minutes of life
will be your worst.

01:46.940 --> 01:48.024
Stay close, lads.

01:51.152 --> 01:54.696
Where the hell
did you find this kid?

01:54.697 --> 01:57.449
He was the only schmuck
who answered the ad.

01:57.450 --> 01:59.786
Really?

02:15.385 --> 02:16.553
Tabura!

02:21.182 --> 02:22.474
What are you doing?

02:22.475 --> 02:24.519
Oh, that was big.
Okay, stop it.

02:27.021 --> 02:28.897
So, uh, Flynn?

02:28.898 --> 02:30.899
It's been about an hour
since the last time

02:30.900 --> 02:32.943
you said we were gonna
be there any minute,

02:32.944 --> 02:34.945
so how much further, please?

02:34.946 --> 02:36.947
We'll know when we get there,
won't we?

02:36.948 --> 02:38.700
Gun.

02:44.455 --> 02:46.040
Brilliant. Gun.

02:56.676 --> 02:58.011
Get this.

03:01.514 --> 03:03.974
It's a warning.

03:03.975 --> 03:05.893
Stay here!

03:05.894 --> 03:07.020
Tabura.

03:08.605 --> 03:10.773
Get a nice close-up.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.836
On second thought, stay with me.

03:50.021 --> 03:51.522
Careful, sport.

04:08.957 --> 04:11.084
Who's the lucky stiff?

04:12.502 --> 04:16.004
He was a prospector.

04:16.005 --> 04:20.132
I'm guessing his prospects
aren't lookin' so hot, huh?

04:20.134 --> 04:21.677
Savages did this?

04:21.678 --> 04:23.303
Taking gold from the island

04:23.304 --> 04:25.639
is like stealing blood
from the gods.

04:25.640 --> 04:28.101
I know the feeling.
I got two ex-wives.

04:37.944 --> 04:39.277
Oh, Schwartz!

04:39.278 --> 04:41.447
Yeah?
This guy's still warm.

04:43.408 --> 04:47.744
(DRUM BEATING)

04:47.745 --> 04:49.414
What is that?

04:51.791 --> 04:54.876
(WHISPERING)
What is he saying to you?

04:54.877 --> 04:57.629
Stay close, lads.
They're watching us right now.

04:57.630 --> 04:59.423
What? Where?

04:59.424 --> 05:01.758
Tell 'em to come out.
I'll charm their pants off.

05:01.759 --> 05:04.053
That won't be necessary,
Schwartz.

05:07.223 --> 05:09.182
Okay.
Come on, come on!

05:09.183 --> 05:10.600
I'm trying! Just give me a sec!

05:10.601 --> 05:11.769
Give me it!

05:26.909 --> 05:28.577
Hot damn.

Puk puk! Puk puk!

07:01.879 --> 07:03.506
What's he saying?

07:05.007 --> 07:07.259
Get me back to the studios.

07:07.260 --> 07:08.719
Come on!

07:27.405 --> 07:28.446
Film it.

07:28.447 --> 07:29.615
What?
Film it!

07:40.543 --> 07:41.711
It's brilliant!

07:44.505 --> 07:46.591
Come on. Come on!

07:50.094 --> 07:51.804
Get away!

07:59.979 --> 08:01.479
SCHWARTZ: Come on!

08:01.480 --> 08:02.480
Tabura!

08:02.481 --> 08:03.566

08:05.151 --> 08:06.444

08:16.495 --> 08:17.829
Flynn!

08:17.830 --> 08:18.831
Come on!

08:33.679 --> 08:35.890
Are you happy now, Schwartz?

08:59.413 --> 09:02.916
Hell of a gin mill
you got here, Flynn.

09:02.917 --> 09:05.085
You're all right, you know that?

09:05.086 --> 09:08.047
He's better than all right.
(LAUGHS)

09:11.342 --> 09:14.469
You, sir, are an honest-to-God
son of a bitch.

09:14.470 --> 09:15.513
To you.

09:19.100 --> 09:20.767
Good hooch.

09:20.768 --> 09:23.019
(SIGHS)

09:23.020 --> 09:25.940
He's a headliner,
and he doesn't even know it.

09:30.319 --> 09:33.863
Well, kiddo, you got us
back safe as agreed,

09:33.864 --> 09:36.450
so that's yours.

09:40.371 --> 09:41.788
Thanks.

09:41.789 --> 09:44.374
What, he doesn't even
count it, huh?

09:44.375 --> 09:46.293
That's a man with confidence.

09:46.294 --> 09:49.797
I like that quality
in an individual.

09:52.883 --> 09:56.678
I'm sorry about the boy.
That was...

09:56.679 --> 09:58.805
Yeah.
It was bad luck.

09:58.806 --> 10:03.018
All right? We're gonna
immortalize him for you.

10:03.019 --> 10:05.770
Anyways, you find yourself
out in Hollywood, kid,

10:05.771 --> 10:07.689
you give us a call because
we can use a guy like you,

10:07.690 --> 10:10.942
doesn't need to walk a flight
of stairs with a stuntman.

10:10.943 --> 10:13.862
Well, I'm afraid civilization
no longer agrees with me.

10:13.863 --> 10:16.114
Oh, really?
You don't think I didn't notice

10:16.115 --> 10:19.034
that little glint in your eye?

10:19.035 --> 10:20.577
There's nothin' like
a little bit of gold dust

10:20.578 --> 10:23.247
to spur on a man's
wild goose chase, huh?

10:27.501 --> 10:29.920
I'll be seein' ya, kid.
(LAUGHS)

10:43.017 --> 10:46.020
(THUNDER RUMBLING)

10:51.776 --> 10:53.361
Come on! Come on!

10:56.030 --> 10:58.449
Come on! Come here!

11:07.792 --> 11:09.168
Come on!
Yeah!

11:35.694 --> 11:37.320
Hell of a fight.

11:37.321 --> 11:38.656
I've had better.

11:40.116 --> 11:42.075
Well, I'll be goddamned.

11:42.076 --> 11:43.493
Never thought I'd see
Errol Flynn

11:43.494 --> 11:45.538
roaming these streets again.

11:46.747 --> 11:49.040
Good fight, mate.

11:49.041 --> 11:51.210
What, that's it?
It is what it is, Rexie.

11:53.838 --> 11:56.423
I have something that
may be of interest to you.

11:56.424 --> 11:59.551
Say we discuss it over a pint.
On me.

11:59.552 --> 12:01.052
I taught you
everything you know, kid.

12:01.053 --> 12:02.554
Think I don't know a scam
when I hear it?

12:02.555 --> 12:03.596
Not this time, Rex.

12:03.597 --> 12:05.306
The sirens of the sea beckon.

12:05.307 --> 12:08.059
Spare me your bullshit, Flynn.
You're a goddamn pirate.

12:08.060 --> 12:11.563
Ladies.

12:11.564 --> 12:14.441
You wanna squabble by my table,
it'll cost you some quid

12:14.442 --> 12:16.734
or cost you your lives.

12:16.735 --> 12:19.822
Now beat it before
I set Big Jim on ya.

12:22.199 --> 12:23.617
Just deal the cards, Frankie.

12:28.080 --> 12:31.791
Only one calls me that
is my mother.

12:31.792 --> 12:33.835
Last man calling me that

12:33.836 --> 12:36.296
found himself
with his tongue cut out,

12:36.297 --> 12:38.631
shoved full up his ass.

12:38.632 --> 12:40.258
(LAUGHTER)

12:40.259 --> 12:42.927
Now I know folks love
a good tongue up the ass,

12:42.928 --> 12:45.222
don't they, love?
(LAUGHS)

12:46.807 --> 12:50.018
So long as it ain't their own.

12:50.019 --> 12:53.272
I'll take your money.
Deal the cards.

12:55.483 --> 12:58.776
You see, I've just come back
from New Guinea.

12:58.777 --> 13:00.570
Took some Hollywood
bigwig up the Sepik River

13:00.571 --> 13:02.614
to get some background footage
for his pansy actors.

13:02.615 --> 13:04.157
You've never been up the Sepik.

13:04.158 --> 13:06.910
I have now.
And I'll tell you something.

13:06.911 --> 13:09.329
It's lined with gold.

13:09.330 --> 13:12.081
Cards are gettin' cold, Yank.

13:12.082 --> 13:13.208
I'm Canadian.

13:13.209 --> 13:15.711
Well, whoopsy-fucking-do.

13:17.213 --> 13:18.881
I'll raise you so, Canadian.

13:22.968 --> 13:24.094
He's in.

13:27.932 --> 13:29.390
Gimme one.

13:29.391 --> 13:31.226
You see, every fool
with a shovel

13:31.227 --> 13:32.894
is scrambling for a piece.

13:32.895 --> 13:34.354
Man and woman.

13:34.355 --> 13:36.356
Wealth and women?

13:36.357 --> 13:38.067
Well, that doesn't sound like
Errol Flynn.

13:45.407 --> 13:46.617
All in.

13:49.912 --> 13:52.331
It's all right.
He's good for it.

14:06.136 --> 14:08.096
You got balls, Rex.

14:08.097 --> 14:09.806
Now pay up
if you want to keep 'em.

14:09.807 --> 14:11.558
Just give me a break here.
I could pay you tomorrow...

14:11.559 --> 14:15.020
Jimmy, this son of a bitch
thinks I'm stupid.

14:16.730 --> 14:19.232
Easy.

14:19.233 --> 14:21.818
Tender flesh cuts up nice.

14:21.819 --> 14:22.986
FLYNN: How much does he owe?

14:22.987 --> 14:24.237
Three large.

14:24.238 --> 14:25.989
Three large?

14:25.990 --> 14:28.033
That's an expensive friend.

14:32.538 --> 14:33.705
Half!

14:33.706 --> 14:35.373
Half's not bad.

14:35.374 --> 14:39.252
You know what it is
men fear the most, Rex?

14:39.253 --> 14:40.837
Reputation.

14:40.838 --> 14:43.965
The kind you get for
killing a man in cold blood.

14:43.966 --> 14:46.718
But a man's infamy
is only as strong

14:46.719 --> 14:49.429
as what he does to keep it.

14:49.430 --> 14:51.973
What do you think happens
to that reputation

14:51.974 --> 14:54.476
if I cut you a break?

14:56.353 --> 14:58.062
People might think
I've gone soft.

14:58.063 --> 15:00.231
Can't have that now, can we?

15:00.232 --> 15:02.734
We can work it out.
We'll work it out, all right.

15:02.735 --> 15:05.403
Now let me widen
that grin of yours!

15:05.404 --> 15:07.323
Frank, the money!

15:53.952 --> 15:54.953
Rex.

16:04.963 --> 16:07.006
So New Guinea,
how are we getting there?

16:07.007 --> 16:09.551
Leave it with me.
I've got an idea.

16:21.689 --> 16:24.066
Flynn, this is my kinda place.

16:27.945 --> 16:30.322
Mm, welcome home.

16:32.241 --> 16:33.325
Hello.

16:36.412 --> 16:38.914
Oh, what do we have here?

16:41.417 --> 16:43.419
Some tea for you?

16:51.343 --> 16:53.386
Behave yourself.

16:53.387 --> 16:55.096
How is your tea?

16:55.097 --> 16:56.724
Oh, um...

16:59.393 --> 17:00.810
Lovely.

17:00.811 --> 17:02.019
Tasty.

17:02.020 --> 17:03.772
(SPEAKING CHINESE)

17:07.651 --> 17:10.528
You two don't belong here.

17:10.529 --> 17:12.155
What brings you?

17:12.156 --> 17:15.450
Well, Miss, uh...

17:15.451 --> 17:16.451
Achun.

17:16.452 --> 17:18.037
Achun.

17:19.663 --> 17:21.705
Ravishing name.

17:21.707 --> 17:24.000
We're interested
in purchasing a boat

17:24.001 --> 17:26.002
I hear you're quite interested
in selling.

17:26.002 --> 17:28.128
Well, you've heard wrong, Mr...

17:28.130 --> 17:29.423
Flynn.

17:30.507 --> 17:31.633
Rex.

17:33.302 --> 17:35.178
We don't need anything fancy.

17:35.179 --> 17:37.014
Old one moored out front,
perhaps?

17:38.557 --> 17:41.392
I could offer you...

17:41.393 --> 17:42.393
a hundred?

17:42.394 --> 17:43.896
(CHUCKLES)

17:44.897 --> 17:46.189
No, thanks, old sport.

17:46.190 --> 17:47.523
I don't care much for business

17:47.524 --> 17:52.111
complicated by formality,
Mr. Flynn.

17:52.112 --> 17:55.656
A man's sincerity is revealed

17:55.657 --> 17:59.994
when his mind is
free of the need to lie.

17:59.995 --> 18:01.955
Who are you?

18:03.040 --> 18:05.125
I don't know anymore.

18:06.710 --> 18:08.920
You're a mirage.

18:08.921 --> 18:11.297
A painting...

18:11.298 --> 18:13.675
personified to haunt my dreams.

18:15.302 --> 18:18.721
Do you know what I do
with men like you?

18:18.722 --> 18:19.764
Uh-uh.

18:19.765 --> 18:21.432
I own them...

18:21.433 --> 18:24.894
until they no longer
serve a purpose,

18:24.895 --> 18:26.604
at which point,

18:26.605 --> 18:31.401
I derive pleasure
from watching them suffer.

18:32.569 --> 18:35.196
Well...

18:35.197 --> 18:38.658
I'm perfectly willing
to be your property,

18:38.659 --> 18:40.117
but...

18:40.118 --> 18:43.871
if pain's your bag,

18:43.872 --> 18:47.041
then he's your man.

18:47.042 --> 18:48.085
Huh?

18:52.172 --> 18:55.424
(GROANS)

18:55.425 --> 18:57.510
Oh, where am I?

18:57.511 --> 19:00.596
Well, this, my fine man,
is the Sirocco.

19:00.597 --> 19:03.975
I'm captain,
and you're first mate.

19:03.976 --> 19:06.435
I feel like I've been sucking
on a sheep all night.

19:06.436 --> 19:09.605
Well, she was a lot of things,
but by no means a sheep.

19:09.606 --> 19:12.733
Come on.
We have work to do.

19:12.734 --> 19:14.735
What happened?

19:14.736 --> 19:17.154
Rotten amnesia, eh?

19:17.155 --> 19:19.156
Well, seeing as Achun
refused to sell us this boat,

19:19.157 --> 19:21.451
you volunteered as decoy.

19:24.705 --> 19:26.039
(WHIP CRACKS)

Ooh!

19:28.792 --> 19:30.167
For what?

19:30.168 --> 19:31.544
Well, for me to steal it,
of course.

19:31.545 --> 19:33.588
You robbed the Chinese pirates?

19:33.589 --> 19:35.381
We robbed the Chinese pirates.

19:35.382 --> 19:37.884
And you used me
as a goddamn decoy.

19:37.885 --> 19:39.427
Now they're gonna chop us up
into fish bait.

19:39.428 --> 19:42.638
Cheer up. Nothing like death
to fuel ambition.

19:42.639 --> 19:45.558
Besides, seeing as I've been
relieved of most of my cash,

19:45.559 --> 19:47.435
I didn't have much choice,
now, did I?

19:47.436 --> 19:48.729
Ow!

19:54.276 --> 19:55.735
Ahoy there!

19:55.736 --> 19:57.194
Permission to board,
Captain Flynn?

19:57.195 --> 19:58.195
Oh, you didn't.

19:58.196 --> 19:59.655
Oh, but I did.

19:59.656 --> 20:01.407
Permission granted.

20:01.408 --> 20:03.701
How are you, Adams?
How are you, Flynn?

20:03.702 --> 20:05.369
I say, I've got the maps,

20:05.370 --> 20:07.872
I've got the sextant,
I've got the compass,

20:07.873 --> 20:10.292
I've got... Hey!

20:13.503 --> 20:15.087
What, are you bringing Flynn
his laundry?

20:15.088 --> 20:16.882
Still the beam of sunshine,
eh, Rex?

20:19.051 --> 20:21.260
Look at those lines.

20:21.261 --> 20:22.803
They don't make 'em
like this anymore.

20:22.804 --> 20:24.388
You seriously invited the Dook?

20:24.389 --> 20:26.265
Dook?
Yeah.

20:26.266 --> 20:28.434
With that pompous Duke of
Wellington accent of yours.

20:28.435 --> 20:31.270
Well, if you must know, Flynn
invited me to join the voyage.

20:31.271 --> 20:34.398
Navigates better than a sextant.
Besides, the boy's a crack shot.

20:34.399 --> 20:35.816
Crack shot, my ass.

20:35.817 --> 20:37.276
Well, go on, shoot his ass.

20:37.277 --> 20:38.444
Where'd you learn
how to handle a gun?

20:38.445 --> 20:39.779
At school, of course.

20:39.780 --> 20:41.155
But aren't you studying
to be a teacher?

20:41.156 --> 20:42.573
Could teach you a thing or two.

20:42.574 --> 20:45.243
Shoot the tick
off an elephant's ass.

20:46.662 --> 20:48.789
Shall we?
Yes, we shall.

20:53.085 --> 20:56.045
Let her fly.

20:56.046 --> 20:57.755
(GUNSHOT)

20:57.756 --> 20:58.882
(COIN DROPS)

21:07.307 --> 21:08.684
Lucky shot.

21:11.228 --> 21:12.687
Amazing that one still works.

21:12.688 --> 21:13.938
At least until
more people realize

21:13.939 --> 21:16.316
the French put holes
in their coins.

21:17.776 --> 21:19.485
Good to have you aboard, Dook.

21:19.486 --> 21:20.736
Not you too.

21:20.737 --> 21:23.281
Well, like a fine suit,
that title fits.

22:52.829 --> 22:55.414
Oh, disgusting!

22:55.415 --> 22:58.251
Bloody god-awful Chinese tea!

23:11.014 --> 23:12.348
(CORK POPS)

23:12.349 --> 23:15.851
Take note, chaps,
and embrace this,

23:15.852 --> 23:19.021
this moment,
who we are this instant,

23:19.022 --> 23:21.107
because we will never be
these men again.

23:21.108 --> 23:23.400
Jesus, Flynn.
Just pass the bottle.

23:23.401 --> 23:26.362
This is a moment, Rex.
Enjoy it.

23:26.363 --> 23:27.446
Cheers.

23:27.447 --> 23:29.074
Cheers.
Cheers.

23:48.301 --> 23:50.302
You know what you're
looking at there, princess?

23:50.303 --> 23:52.096
Of course.

23:52.097 --> 23:54.807
In theory.
Theory?

23:54.808 --> 23:56.642
I've read everything
ever published about sailing.

23:56.643 --> 23:58.727
How many voyages
have you actually navigated?

23:58.728 --> 24:00.855
I'm proud to say
this will be my first.

24:00.856 --> 24:03.525
Good God.
We're gonna die.

24:07.195 --> 24:08.613
Bloody hell!

24:13.743 --> 24:15.786
Stop right there!
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

24:15.787 --> 24:18.873
Stop right...
Oh, my God almighty!

24:18.874 --> 24:21.458
Good morning, ladies.

24:21.459 --> 24:23.044
Good morning, ladies all.

24:25.130 --> 24:27.047
This isn't what
I signed up for, Flynn.

24:27.048 --> 24:28.883
You said it was going to be fun.

24:28.884 --> 24:31.344
Great start, Flynn.
Oh, this is ridiculous.

25:04.377 --> 25:06.170
Now...

25:06.171 --> 25:09.757
what are you pricks
doing on my boat?

25:09.758 --> 25:12.426
FLYNN: This is our boat.
Rubbish.

25:12.427 --> 25:14.678
She's mine.

25:14.679 --> 25:16.889
And I lost her
to a pirate wench.

25:16.890 --> 25:18.974
Well, we acquired her
fair and square.

25:18.975 --> 25:22.436
The only thing a man acquires
from Achun

25:22.437 --> 25:25.773
is a severed jugular.

25:25.774 --> 25:27.441
Now tell me how you got her,

25:27.442 --> 25:30.819
or I'll cut the three of you
like tuna.

25:30.820 --> 25:33.530
Can we discuss this
like gentlemen?

25:33.531 --> 25:34.907
I'm Trelawney Adams,

25:34.908 --> 25:39.036
and this is Errol and Rex.

25:39.037 --> 25:42.122
My name's Charlie, Your Majesty.

25:42.123 --> 25:45.376
And I don't give a crap.
Now some truth!

25:45.377 --> 25:48.420
All right, all right.

25:48.421 --> 25:50.756
You see, we...
we stole it.

25:50.757 --> 25:52.758
We're headed to New Guinea
to claim a fortune in gold!

25:52.759 --> 25:53.801
Dook!
I'm sorry!

25:53.802 --> 25:57.888
(LAUGHS)

25:57.889 --> 26:01.810
What do you landlubbers know
about sailing the Coral Sea?

26:04.938 --> 26:08.857
She'd swallow you whole
and spit you back out!

26:08.858 --> 26:11.860
Even if you somehow
managed to navigate

26:11.861 --> 26:14.822
the razor-sharp reefs
of the Barrier,

26:14.823 --> 26:16.490
you've gotta
pass through cyclones

26:16.491 --> 26:19.118
that'll blow your bloody
foreskins off.

26:19.119 --> 26:23.455
No! The only way
the Sirocco goes anywhere

26:23.456 --> 26:25.625
is with me aboard.

26:31.548 --> 26:33.550
She responds to my touch.

26:37.053 --> 26:39.346
Well, then come with us.
Are you mad?

26:39.347 --> 26:41.682
We'll give you equal share.
Are you completely mad?

26:41.683 --> 26:45.562
You think I give a wallaby's
nutsack about your gold, mate?

26:48.398 --> 26:50.733
I just came for my boat.

26:50.734 --> 26:52.861
Well, then she's all yours.

26:54.529 --> 26:56.405
If you help us
get to New Guinea.

26:56.406 --> 26:58.032
Flynn!

26:58.033 --> 27:03.287
Why should I sail with
a bunch of thieving sissies?

27:03.288 --> 27:05.831
When I could just kill ya, hmm?

27:05.832 --> 27:08.709
Because you wouldn't be on
this boat if it wasn't for us.

27:08.710 --> 27:11.295
And because I see
she means a lot to you.

27:11.296 --> 27:14.506
And Lord knows
we could use the expertise.

27:14.507 --> 27:16.342
Come with us.
You'll have a heading to sail

27:16.343 --> 27:17.843
and a chance to blow
this wretched hole

27:17.844 --> 27:19.721
and get rich in the process.

27:21.222 --> 27:23.933
It's only one voyage away.

27:25.643 --> 27:27.645
What do you say, Charlie?

27:37.697 --> 27:39.323
You did fix her up nice.

27:39.324 --> 27:41.618
Thank you.

27:53.880 --> 27:55.548
When do we leave?

27:58.218 --> 28:00.844
You're not gonna kill us?

28:00.845 --> 28:04.808
You want me to change my mind?
No, no, no, no.

28:11.815 --> 28:13.441
One condition.

28:15.402 --> 28:17.779
I captain this voyage.

28:19.989 --> 28:21.990
At least until you drown.

28:21.991 --> 28:24.452
(LAUGHING)

28:27.455 --> 28:29.915
Come on, lads.
Let's go find some gold.

28:29.916 --> 28:31.418
Bloody mad.

28:35.213 --> 28:37.298
Can you guys untie me?

28:42.679 --> 28:44.680
CHARLIE: Orders, Captain?

28:44.681 --> 28:46.723
FLYNN: Full speed ahead!

28:46.724 --> 28:49.686
Full speed ahead!

28:51.646 --> 28:54.106
He still stinks of whiskey.
Then he'll fit right in.

28:54.107 --> 28:56.400
He could cut our throats
as we sleep.

28:56.401 --> 28:58.068
He wouldn't do that,
would you now, Charlie?

28:58.069 --> 28:59.862
'Course not, Captain.

28:59.863 --> 29:02.823
Besides, best to slit a man's
throat when he's awake.

29:02.824 --> 29:05.367
Quicker heart rate.
Bleeds out faster.

Cheers.

32:07.508 --> 32:09.385
Cheers.

32:20.271 --> 32:22.689
What's the real reason
you didn't kill us, Charlie?

32:22.690 --> 32:25.984
I'm no more a murderer
than you are, sailor boy.

32:25.985 --> 32:28.028
And by the looks of you lot,

32:28.029 --> 32:31.448
won't be long before
you get yourselves dead,

32:31.449 --> 32:34.117
and I get my boat back.

32:34.118 --> 32:36.244
How's a man like you
go from owning to losing

32:36.245 --> 32:37.914
to working a ship like this?

32:39.582 --> 32:43.335
(VOMITING)

32:43.336 --> 32:44.921
(FLYNN LAUGHS)

32:48.049 --> 32:51.511
(VOMITING)
(WATER SPLASHING)

32:54.430 --> 32:55.806
With all this retching going on,

32:55.807 --> 32:57.307
it's impossible
to get any shuteye.

32:57.308 --> 33:00.560
(GROANING)

33:00.561 --> 33:03.314
I was just asking Charlie
how he came upon the Sirocco.

33:10.488 --> 33:12.115
Well...

33:16.536 --> 33:19.539
She belonged
to a French fisherman.

33:21.624 --> 33:26.003
We used her in the war
to move wounded from the Somme.

33:30.258 --> 33:34.137
After Armistice,
I offered to buy her from him.

33:36.931 --> 33:39.933
He gave me the boat,

33:39.934 --> 33:43.145
but he made me promise
to take his daughter with me,

33:43.146 --> 33:46.232
give her a better life.

33:51.070 --> 33:52.822
She was...

33:56.367 --> 33:59.661
We traveled the world together,

33:59.662 --> 34:01.456
she and I.

34:03.040 --> 34:05.293
Nowhere we couldn't go.

34:09.880 --> 34:11.841
We fell in love.

34:13.301 --> 34:16.429
Even raised a child
on these very boards.

34:20.141 --> 34:23.436
But she grew tired of the ocean.

34:26.522 --> 34:29.940
Said I spent more time on deck
than I did on her.

34:29.942 --> 34:32.027
(CHUCKLES)

34:32.027 --> 34:33.696
She was right.

34:35.572 --> 34:38.033
She wanted to settle.

34:38.034 --> 34:40.118
Stay put.

34:40.119 --> 34:42.413
But I couldn't.

34:46.083 --> 34:48.377
I longed for the sea.

34:56.886 --> 34:58.930
So I let her go.

35:05.353 --> 35:09.232
I was in the South China Sea
when Achun found me.

35:10.775 --> 35:13.610
Threw me overboard.

35:13.611 --> 35:15.445
Wasn't for a fishing trawler,

35:15.446 --> 35:18.241
I would've made my bed
with Poseidon.

35:21.202 --> 35:24.872
Followed that Chinese bitch
all the way to Old Sydney Town.

35:27.416 --> 35:30.086
That's when I found you blokes.

35:31.128 --> 35:33.588
It's true?

35:33.589 --> 35:35.967
You survived the Great War?

35:37.927 --> 35:39.762
I was lucky.

35:49.689 --> 35:52.232
She's a damn good ship, Charlie.

35:52.233 --> 35:54.693
Just like you.

35:54.694 --> 35:56.696
Been through hell
and pushing for heaven.

36:00.950 --> 36:03.452
I'm at my beam's end, mate.

36:05.997 --> 36:08.583
Just trying to stay afloat.

36:23.014 --> 36:25.181
Skint.

36:25.182 --> 36:27.601
Now what?

36:27.602 --> 36:31.479
This is serious, Flynn.

36:31.480 --> 36:33.732
Ain't much worse way to go
than starving to death.

36:33.733 --> 36:36.401
No one's dying, lads.

36:36.402 --> 36:38.613
All right, leave it with me.

37:10.728 --> 37:13.396
My compliments to the chef.

37:13.397 --> 37:16.400
See if we can go rustle up
something else.

37:25.409 --> 37:28.286
Wonderful spot.

37:28.287 --> 37:29.996
Perfect place to die.

37:29.997 --> 37:31.499
(CHUCKLES)

37:35.252 --> 37:38.255
You got a lot of years
left in you, Charlie.

37:41.884 --> 37:44.719
Maybe I should follow
in your footsteps.

37:44.720 --> 37:46.471
What?

37:46.472 --> 37:48.974
No family to weigh you down.

37:48.975 --> 37:53.019
Nothing on your back
but a stiff ocean breeze.

37:53.020 --> 37:54.896
You're free.

37:54.897 --> 37:57.315
Free?

37:57.316 --> 38:00.694
You need to hoist your sail
a little higher, mate.

38:00.695 --> 38:02.654
You're a good lad.

38:02.655 --> 38:06.408
Don't want to wind up
like the likes of me.

38:06.409 --> 38:08.660
Find your own horizon.

38:08.661 --> 38:11.372
Take more than a few fish
to keep us going.

38:13.791 --> 38:15.667
You're their captain.

38:15.668 --> 38:19.630
Their lives are in your hands.

38:26.303 --> 38:29.764
I think we'll make it just fine.

38:29.765 --> 38:31.267
I believe ya.

38:34.145 --> 38:35.770
Careful with that.

38:35.771 --> 38:38.106
It's a predatory gastropod.
What?

38:38.107 --> 38:39.691
Venom affects
your nervous system.

38:39.692 --> 38:41.818
Oh. Right.

38:41.819 --> 38:43.945
Son of a professor.

38:43.946 --> 38:46.865
Maybe you retire here, Charlie.

38:46.866 --> 38:49.409
Blow it up your ass, mate.

38:49.410 --> 38:50.535
(FARTS)

38:50.536 --> 38:52.204
(LAUGHING)

39:10.931 --> 39:14.017
Hey, we got some visitors.

39:14.018 --> 39:15.269
Hello, girls!

39:16.437 --> 39:17.938
Hoo-hoo!

39:19.523 --> 39:20.607
Whoa!

39:20.608 --> 39:21.942
(LAUGHING)

39:24.195 --> 39:25.820
Lovely.

39:25.821 --> 39:27.614
Oh, that's good luck, you know.

39:27.615 --> 39:29.532
You boys thinking
what I'm thinking?

39:29.533 --> 39:31.452
Why am I nervous?

39:33.662 --> 39:35.289
(LAUGHING)

39:37.500 --> 39:39.834
We are eating porpoise tonight.

39:39.835 --> 39:41.337
What are you doing?

39:44.215 --> 39:46.049
Fishing.
It's bad luck!

39:46.050 --> 39:48.009
For the dolphin.
Dook's right, mate.

39:48.010 --> 39:50.845
You just take that
and put that downstairs, right?

39:50.846 --> 39:52.388
I'm still hungry.
You'll doom us all!

39:52.389 --> 39:54.308
No, just you!

39:55.976 --> 39:57.894
Rex.
Dook's right.

39:57.895 --> 39:59.438
Rex!

40:01.774 --> 40:02.816
No!

40:02.817 --> 40:05.401
The next will find your ass.

40:05.402 --> 40:08.238
What, you're gonna shoot me
over a fish?

40:08.239 --> 40:10.657
That mammal has more goodness
in its dorsal fin

40:10.658 --> 40:12.158
than you'll ever have!

40:12.159 --> 40:14.077
Even with a gun,
you're still a pansy.

40:14.078 --> 40:15.578
And you're a bully.
So what?

40:15.579 --> 40:17.498
What are you gonna do about it,
crack shot?

40:21.836 --> 40:23.295
I guess you'd better
do something.

40:25.714 --> 40:28.383
Jack Reginald Gough, the Third!

40:28.384 --> 40:30.510
What?

40:30.511 --> 40:31.970
You bastard!

40:31.971 --> 40:36.224
Jack Reginald Gough, the Third.

40:36.225 --> 40:39.269
That's Rex's real name.
(CHARLIE LAUGHING)

40:39.270 --> 40:43.982
Your real name is Jack Gough?
You can't be serious.

40:43.983 --> 40:45.775
It's French,
and it's pronounced "Go,"

40:45.776 --> 40:47.360
and damn you, Flynn!

40:47.361 --> 40:49.779
And that stays on the boat.
Do you guys hear me?

40:49.780 --> 40:51.906
On the boat!

40:51.907 --> 40:54.159
I'll take "Dook" any day.

40:54.160 --> 40:57.745
In fact, I don't even
feel sick anymore.

40:57.746 --> 40:59.581
Look, you guys, I wasn't
gonna shoot the dolphin.

40:59.582 --> 41:01.207
So why don't you just
put down the...

41:01.208 --> 41:03.001
(GUNSHOT)

41:03.002 --> 41:04.295
(YELLS)

41:06.213 --> 41:08.799
FLYNN: You hit the engine!

41:11.218 --> 41:13.761
Dook, hold her steady!

41:13.762 --> 41:15.263
Where's it coming from?

41:15.264 --> 41:17.182
She's missing a bloody bolt!

41:17.183 --> 41:18.641
Got bigger problems.

41:18.642 --> 41:20.810
We've got a hole this big.

41:20.811 --> 41:23.146
(HISSING)
(SCREAMS)

41:23.147 --> 41:26.524
(SCREAMING)

41:26.525 --> 41:29.194
Let me see!
Oh, bloody hell

41:29.195 --> 41:30.778
Charlie, where's the pump?

41:30.779 --> 41:32.447
By the stairs!

41:32.448 --> 41:34.533
We need to take care
of his hand!

41:36.118 --> 41:37.952
No, don't!
You need warm water on it.

41:37.953 --> 41:39.830
Don't move.

41:42.041 --> 41:44.375
Get it in here.
(YELLS)

41:44.376 --> 41:46.628
Keep it in there, boy!

41:46.629 --> 41:48.004
Charlie, I've got a second pump.

41:48.005 --> 41:49.464
All right.

41:49.465 --> 41:50.507
Dook, get down here!

41:53.344 --> 41:55.762
Oh, my goodness.
Take over.

41:55.763 --> 41:58.557
Think, Charlie, think.
Think!

42:00.267 --> 42:03.645
(GROANS)
Goddamn it!

42:03.646 --> 42:05.939
Goddamn it!

42:05.940 --> 42:08.400
Quick, get me something heavy!

42:11.737 --> 42:12.947
Hurry!

42:16.825 --> 42:18.369
Right, in there!

42:29.838 --> 42:31.673
That'll do it.

42:31.674 --> 42:34.593
(SIGHS)
Oh, I'm too old for this.

42:39.056 --> 42:40.891
If it's not one thing...

42:42.518 --> 42:45.144
Don't! Stop!
The rag! It'll...

42:45.145 --> 42:46.814
(RUMBLE)

42:48.440 --> 42:50.858
...get caught up in the prop.

42:50.859 --> 42:51.902
Jesus.

43:14.717 --> 43:16.343
A rag.

43:20.222 --> 43:21.764
That's not a dolphin.

43:21.765 --> 43:24.309
That's a bloody shark!

43:24.310 --> 43:26.185
Flynn!

43:26.186 --> 43:27.896
Flynn!
Flynn!

43:33.569 --> 43:35.361
Hey!
Flynn!

43:35.362 --> 43:36.739
Flynn!
Flynn!

43:46.165 --> 43:48.292
Flynn!
Stop! You might hit Flynn!

43:53.630 --> 43:55.298
Flynn!

43:55.299 --> 43:56.633
Flynn!
Errol!

43:56.634 --> 43:57.634
Flynn!

43:57.635 --> 43:59.677
Errol!
Flynn!

43:59.678 --> 44:01.220
Flynn!
Errol!

44:01.221 --> 44:03.098
Flynn!
Errol!

44:05.059 --> 44:06.810
Oh, my Lord.

44:14.485 --> 44:16.402
Did I miss something?

44:16.403 --> 44:17.653
Thank the heavens.

44:17.654 --> 44:19.655
You son of a bitch.
What?

44:19.656 --> 44:22.075
Nothing to
concern yourself with.

44:22.076 --> 44:24.203
Let's go have a look
at the pump.

44:51.480 --> 44:53.357
Having fun yet?

44:56.151 --> 44:57.528
Will she hold?

44:59.863 --> 45:01.698
Tight as a nut.

45:05.619 --> 45:07.121
You all right?

45:08.539 --> 45:10.415
You were right, Charlie.

45:10.416 --> 45:12.125
On the island.

45:12.126 --> 45:15.086
Their lives are in my hands.

45:15.087 --> 45:17.505
You're doing okey-kokey, kid.

45:17.506 --> 45:21.676
Blown engine, hole in the hull,
Rex's hand.

45:21.677 --> 45:23.386
Well...

45:23.387 --> 45:27.182
You see, that is the thing
about horizons.

45:29.601 --> 45:31.437
There's always a new one.

45:34.523 --> 45:36.149
Aye.

45:36.150 --> 45:37.276
Aye.

45:48.871 --> 45:50.747
Welcome to Townsville!

45:52.916 --> 45:55.585
A little whiffy at the moment.
You'll get used to it.

45:55.586 --> 45:58.504
Yeah, business been
a little bit slow of late.

45:58.505 --> 45:59.755
And you are?

45:59.756 --> 46:02.091
Christian Travers,
Harbor Master.

46:02.092 --> 46:05.219
And as of last election, Mayor.

46:05.220 --> 46:07.305
I'm also the local priest,

46:07.306 --> 46:10.349
if you've got
a bit of confessing to do.

46:10.350 --> 46:12.894
Quite the résumé.
Oh, too right.

46:12.895 --> 46:15.188
Oh, this is my son Rudolph.

46:15.189 --> 46:17.608
He's the heir to
the local throne, aren't ya?

46:18.942 --> 46:20.526
Are you a boxer?

46:20.527 --> 46:22.403
Look like you can
handle yourself.

46:22.404 --> 46:25.198
I don't condone violence.
Where's the liquor?

46:25.199 --> 46:27.992
Well, that's one thing
we're never short of here.

46:27.993 --> 46:30.453
Look, if you boys need anything,
I mean anything at all,

46:30.454 --> 46:32.038
anything, just come to me.

46:32.039 --> 46:34.248
I'm at the Northerner,
up on Main Street.

46:34.249 --> 46:35.958
I'm there every day.
Every day, I'm there.

46:35.959 --> 46:38.586
Every day I'm there.
Every day, except for Sunday.

46:38.587 --> 46:40.213
That's when I'm at church.

46:40.214 --> 46:43.508
That's also up on
Main Street. Yeah.

46:43.509 --> 46:45.051
Well, I don't know
if we'll be here that long.

46:45.052 --> 46:47.178
You see, she needs some...
Engine.

46:47.179 --> 46:48.596
Some engine work
and a patch job on the hull,

46:48.597 --> 46:49.972
then we'll be on our way.

46:49.973 --> 46:52.475
Oh, we've got
a great engine man here.

46:52.476 --> 46:55.937
He's a great engine man.
He's up on the south side.

46:55.938 --> 46:58.356
Yeah, he'll fix you
right up, yeah.

46:58.357 --> 47:00.858
All right, well,
you boys have a look around.

47:00.859 --> 47:02.902
There's quite the bustle
in town at the moment.

47:02.903 --> 47:05.738
We're a fine modern city
we are here,

47:05.739 --> 47:10.952
with all the needs you'll be,
um, you'll be... needing.

47:10.953 --> 47:12.787
We'll keep that in mind.
Yeah, good on ya.

47:12.788 --> 47:15.373
All righty, well,
we'll see you Sunday, yeah?

47:15.374 --> 47:17.751
Yep.
God bless you all.

47:19.002 --> 47:20.754
Let me know
if you change your mind.

47:22.339 --> 47:24.423
To the Sirocco.

47:24.424 --> 47:26.968
May she live to be
a seaworthy vessel.

47:26.969 --> 47:30.680
To you, mate. Thank God
it weren't your wanking hand.

47:30.681 --> 47:34.851
(MUSIC PLAYING)

47:36.311 --> 47:37.395
A pint, sir.

47:37.396 --> 47:38.688
How old are you?

47:38.689 --> 47:40.648
What do you mean, how old am I?

47:40.649 --> 47:43.109
It's all right. He's with us.
All right.

47:43.110 --> 47:47.154
Thanks, old chap.
What's this then?

47:47.155 --> 47:48.406
Name's Johnson.

47:48.407 --> 47:50.032
Errol Flynn.

47:50.033 --> 47:52.994
This here's Dook,
Charlie, and Rex.

47:52.995 --> 47:54.996
Nearest zoo's
in Brisbane, fella.

47:54.997 --> 47:57.039
(LAUGHTER)

47:57.040 --> 47:59.250
So what's an outfit like yours
in Townsville for?

47:59.251 --> 48:00.585
We're on vacation.

48:00.586 --> 48:02.044
We blew an engine.
We need supplies.

48:02.045 --> 48:04.547
We're headed to New Guinea.

48:04.548 --> 48:06.841
Don't tell me you bastards
are looking for gold.

48:06.842 --> 48:09.218
The mere scent of it
drives men to wretchedness.

48:09.219 --> 48:11.721
Our mayor, for instance,
he'd extort shit from a dunny

48:11.722 --> 48:13.264
if he thought it could
earn him a quid.

48:13.265 --> 48:14.682
My old man
worked himself to death

48:14.683 --> 48:16.976
paying off what he owed
that son of a bitch.

48:16.977 --> 48:19.021
But his day's coming, yes, sir.

48:20.606 --> 48:22.940
Anyway, no subject
more fascinating for a scribe

48:22.941 --> 48:25.234
than the vain pursuit
of capitalism.

48:25.235 --> 48:26.611
You're a writer?

48:26.612 --> 48:28.404
Journo, Townsville Bulletin.

48:28.405 --> 48:30.865
Oh, really?
What section do you handle?

48:30.866 --> 48:32.241
Politics, mainly.

48:32.242 --> 48:33.619
Hello.

48:35.579 --> 48:37.413
Like a moth to a flame.

48:37.414 --> 48:39.874
Excuse me, sir.
Anything the lady wants.

48:39.875 --> 48:41.459
Get scarce, mate.

48:41.460 --> 48:43.419
Well, I don't see a ring,
old boy.

48:43.420 --> 48:45.004
Not that that stopped me before.

48:45.005 --> 48:47.215
Fair game,
as far as I'm concerned.

48:48.467 --> 48:50.551
No worries, bruv.

48:50.552 --> 48:53.013
Watching her for my cousin.

48:57.601 --> 48:58.685
Oh, my Lord.

49:07.235 --> 49:08.277
Hello.

49:08.278 --> 49:10.446
You're gonna suffer.

49:10.447 --> 49:12.156
It's all right, it's all right.
I've got this.

49:12.157 --> 49:14.450
Told you this weren't
a good idea.

49:14.451 --> 49:15.910
I've fought bigger.

49:15.911 --> 49:17.787
One moment.

49:17.788 --> 49:18.830
Pint?

49:23.543 --> 49:24.544
Oh, my.

49:34.388 --> 49:37.766
We can't just sit here.
We have to do something.

49:39.643 --> 49:40.893
Such as?

49:40.894 --> 49:42.603
I suppose you would like
a blind captain

49:42.604 --> 49:45.482
because his eyes are
about to pop out of his head.

49:46.817 --> 49:47.818
Oh, my God.

49:48.944 --> 49:51.028
Watch your stern there, Captain!

49:51.029 --> 49:52.196
(SCREAMS)

49:52.197 --> 49:54.323
(GLASS SHATTERS)

49:54.324 --> 49:56.952
That's gotta hurt.
He'll be all right.

50:16.221 --> 50:17.222
(CRASH)

50:20.767 --> 50:22.560
Come on!

50:22.561 --> 50:24.771
Come on, Flynn!

50:43.790 --> 50:44.833
Whoa!

50:57.929 --> 51:00.098
(CLAPPING CONTINUES)

51:01.600 --> 51:03.643
Bet you weren't expecting that,
ya crook!

51:10.901 --> 51:13.110
Oh, wow.

51:13.111 --> 51:16.113
I've fought bigger!
(LAUGHS)

51:16.114 --> 51:17.823
I thought you were done!
I have fought bigger.

51:17.824 --> 51:19.575
I believe ya.
Many wouldn't.

51:19.576 --> 51:22.203
Hell of a wallop you handed
Travers' prizefighter.

51:22.204 --> 51:23.621
That was brilliant.
David and Goliath.

51:23.622 --> 51:26.165
Lucky punch.
Wait, his prizefighter?

51:26.166 --> 51:28.501
He runs an underground
fight club every Friday.

51:28.502 --> 51:29.627
Big money.

51:29.628 --> 51:30.878
That legal?
Ish.

51:30.879 --> 51:32.254
But he's the mayor!

51:32.255 --> 51:34.089
And priest.
Local boxing promoter too.

51:34.090 --> 51:35.716
That sounds very tiring.

51:35.717 --> 51:38.260
Hedonism on Friday,
confesses to himself on Sunday,

51:38.261 --> 51:39.762
he's square by Monday.

51:39.763 --> 51:41.055
That does not sound good.

51:41.056 --> 51:42.056
Hello, ladies.

51:42.057 --> 51:44.266
It's for a good time.

51:44.267 --> 51:46.393
Where did you get that?
Oh, my Lord!

51:46.394 --> 51:48.854
Wasn't going to give the razors
everything I have now, was I?

51:48.855 --> 51:51.649
You blokes better get
your priorities straight.

51:51.650 --> 51:54.318
We're gonna need that there
for the boat.

51:54.319 --> 51:56.695
You put that back
in your pocket.

51:56.696 --> 51:59.615
I'll take care of this.
It'll be my pleasure.

51:59.616 --> 52:00.992
Let's go!

52:02.452 --> 52:04.204
You're not coming, Charlie?

52:07.332 --> 52:08.791
The only warmth
this body needs tonight

every last bruise.

55:42.047 --> 55:44.632

as your accomplice,

55:52.015 --> 55:53.140
but they didn't have any proof,

55:53.141 --> 55:54.641
so they let me loose.

55:54.642 --> 55:57.227
Then I caught a boat,
hoping to find you.

55:57.228 --> 55:58.771

55:58.772 --> 56:01.440

up the coast.

I can't.

56:33.348 --> 56:35.808
You see, I got here
without a shilling.

56:35.809 --> 56:37.768
Travers took a shine to me,

56:37.769 --> 56:40.312
and I figured I'd use that
to find his stash.

56:40.313 --> 56:44.399
I didn't get far until
his thugs caught up with me.

56:44.400 --> 56:46.652
They gave me a choice.

56:46.653 --> 56:49.113
Work it off on my back...

56:49.114 --> 56:51.406
or worse.

56:51.407 --> 56:53.367
I should have chosen worse.

56:53.368 --> 56:55.662

left you behind.

you take on the kid, yeah?

59:15.927 --> 59:18.053

for two rounds.

59:18.054 --> 59:19.721
I want two good rounds,
you hear? Two good rounds.

then you go down.

takes a dive. No one!

in your outfit wants a boat

59:28.606 --> 59:29.773

01:24:15.925 --> 01:24:19.136
Flynn! Flynn!
Come on! Come on!

01:24:19.137 --> 01:24:21.347
Come on!
(COUGHS)

01:24:24.768 --> 01:24:25.977
Charlie!

01:24:28.062 --> 01:24:29.104
What are you doing?

01:24:29.105 --> 01:24:30.647
Charlie!
Hey!

01:24:30.648 --> 01:24:31.649
Charlie!

01:24:34.903 --> 01:24:36.779
Dook!

01:24:36.780 --> 01:24:38.030
Dook!

01:24:38.031 --> 01:24:39.240
Dook!

01:24:41.451 --> 01:24:42.827
Dook!

01:24:44.120 --> 01:24:46.455
Come back!
Charlie!

01:24:46.456 --> 01:24:48.124
Dook!

01:25:03.848 --> 01:25:05.891
Come back!
No...

01:25:05.892 --> 01:25:07.060
Dook!

01:25:42.554 --> 01:25:44.347
No, no, no!

01:25:47.517 --> 01:25:49.018
No!

(COUGHING)

(SEAGULLS CAWING)

01:26:48.912 --> 01:26:50.705
Rex.

01:26:53.708 --> 01:26:55.959
Where are Dook and Charlie?

01:26:55.960 --> 01:26:58.086
Where are Dook and Charlie?

01:26:58.087 --> 01:27:00.172
Where are they?

01:27:00.173 --> 01:27:03.050
They're gone. They're gone.

01:27:03.051 --> 01:27:05.887
No!
They're gone. They're gone.

01:27:07.805 --> 01:27:09.265
No, no.

01:27:21.653 --> 01:27:25.615
(SOBBING)

01:27:43.591 --> 01:27:46.093
Who are you?

01:27:46.094 --> 01:27:47.679
I'm your nurse.

01:27:50.848 --> 01:27:52.433
Where's Rex?

01:27:53.434 --> 01:27:54.518
Rex?

01:27:54.519 --> 01:27:56.104
Rex.

01:27:57.522 --> 01:27:58.773
He's fine.

01:28:06.698 --> 01:28:10.367
He said some rather disturbing
things in his sleep.

01:28:10.368 --> 01:28:13.204
You should hear him
when he's awake.

01:28:18.167 --> 01:28:21.795
You're both incredibly lucky.

01:28:21.796 --> 01:28:23.840
Missionaries found you.

01:28:26.551 --> 01:28:28.386
It's a miracle.

01:28:37.228 --> 01:28:39.230
I'll check on you later.

01:29:01.878 --> 01:29:03.879
FLYNN: Bones of
many a fine sailor

01:29:03.880 --> 01:29:06.673
at the bottom of this ocean,

01:29:06.674 --> 01:29:09.594
but no men finer
than Dook and Charlie.

01:29:11.721 --> 01:29:14.139
Theirs were far too kind
and decent spirits

01:29:14.140 --> 01:29:16.267
to be lost so young.

01:29:44.921 --> 01:29:46.339
BOY: Mr. Flynn!

01:29:49.008 --> 01:29:50.259
Mr. Flynn!

01:29:51.427 --> 01:29:52.762
Telegram.

01:29:58.768 --> 01:30:00.185
BOY: What's it say?

01:30:00.186 --> 01:30:02.729
SCHWARTZ: "Mr. Errol Flynn.
Stop.

01:30:02.730 --> 01:30:07.484
Come at once to play a part
in my Hollywood picture. Stop.

01:30:07.485 --> 01:30:09.694
All expenses paid. Stop.

01:30:09.695 --> 01:30:12.447
Gonna make you a star, kid.
Stop.

01:30:12.448 --> 01:30:14.033
Joel Schwartz."

(BELL RINGING)

01:30:41.185 --> 01:30:43.270
(KNOCKING)
Yes?

01:30:43.271 --> 01:30:46.315
Mr. Flynn, you have a visitor.
I haven't time for any.

01:30:47.608 --> 01:30:48.693
Rex!

01:30:51.821 --> 01:30:54.447
I ran out of stories.
Good to see you, old sport!

01:30:54.448 --> 01:30:56.241
Errol Flynn, pansy actor.

01:30:56.242 --> 01:30:57.492
I don't know anything
about acting,

01:30:57.493 --> 01:30:58.785
but they pay me just the same.

01:30:58.786 --> 01:31:00.162
To what do I owe the pleasure?

01:31:00.163 --> 01:31:02.164
There's an uprising in Spain.

01:31:02.165 --> 01:31:03.790
I've heard.

01:31:03.791 --> 01:31:05.792
I thought I could interest you
in a real adventure.

01:31:05.793 --> 01:31:07.461
(CHUCKLES)

01:31:12.592 --> 01:31:15.510
It was in the Brisbane paper
that year.

01:31:15.511 --> 01:31:17.637
Hell of a story.

01:31:17.638 --> 01:31:19.849
Wouldn't make
a half-bad picture.

01:31:31.903 --> 01:31:33.820

01:31:48.836 --> 01:31:50.795
Flynn!

01:31:50.796 --> 01:31:52.088
Yes, sir.

01:31:52.089 --> 01:31:54.090
Your ship is sinking.

01:31:54.091 --> 01:31:56.384
The ocean rages.

01:31:56.385 --> 01:31:58.386
And your crew, dead.

01:31:58.387 --> 01:32:00.223
Can you do that?

01:32:03.518 --> 01:32:06.311
MAN: Yeah. Okay, it's clear!

01:32:06.312 --> 01:32:08.271
DIRECTOR: Quiet on set!
(BELL RINGING)

01:32:08.272 --> 01:32:10.148
Roll sound!

01:32:10.149 --> 01:32:11.525
Roll camera!

01:32:16.239 --> 01:32:17.490
