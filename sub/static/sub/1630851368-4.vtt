39:28.600 --> 39:31.134
and there are other people here
who are coasting

39:31.203 --> 39:32.635
and playing it safe,

39:32.704 --> 39:34.804
because they happen to be put
with the right vet.

39:34.873 --> 39:37.807
I think people should remember
that at the end of the day

39:37.876 --> 39:39.776
I may end up
as one of your partners.

39:39.845 --> 39:42.879
I may end up on your side,
and do you want me here

39:42.948 --> 39:44.481
or somebody
who's weaker than me?

39:44.549 --> 39:46.349
- Just to play
devil's advocate,

39:46.418 --> 39:48.017
one of us
will have to go down there.

39:48.086 --> 39:50.453
One of us will,
and are you gonna want to go

39:50.522 --> 39:53.690
against someone very strong,
or are you gonna want to go

39:53.759 --> 39:56.393
against someone that
you're gonna be able to beat?

39:56.461 --> 39:57.961
Because last season
I've had to go against

39:58.029 --> 40:00.463
two of the toughest girls,
and I got two Ls.

40:00.532 --> 40:03.099
and believe me,
that wasn't fun.

40:03.168 --> 40:04.567
Corey L. and Michele

40:04.636 --> 40:06.903
<i> can try their very best</i>
<i> in this deliberation,</i>

40:06.972 --> 40:10.106
but, honey, us vets
are gonna stick strong.

40:10.175 --> 40:12.275
You're not gonna sway
any of us.

40:12.344 --> 40:13.610
- But let's be realistic.

40:13.678 --> 40:16.413
Why are we holding off
on voting in weak people?

40:16.481 --> 40:17.614
What are we holding off on?

40:17.682 --> 40:19.616
Why not even the [bleep]
playing field

40:19.684 --> 40:22.218
where everybody who goes in
has otoing

40:22.287 --> 40:24.154
against somebody
who's an equal competitor?

40:24.222 --> 40:25.789
Why are we saving weak people?

40:25.857 --> 40:28.558
- So basically, the rookie that
they're talking about

40:28.627 --> 40:30.226
possibly needs to speak up
right now,

40:30.295 --> 40:31.594
if you think it's you.

40:31.663 --> 40:34.197
- Whatever is gonna happen
is gonna happen.

40:34.266 --> 40:35.665
It is what it--it's not
personal, so--

40:35.734 --> 40:37.100
- Is that you pleading
your case?

40:37.169 --> 40:38.802
Whatever is gonna happen
is gonna happen?

40:38.870 --> 40:42.005
- Not in terms of myself.
Whatever position I'd be in,

40:42.073 --> 40:45.575
like, I can't tell people
what to do or what not to do,

40:45.644 --> 40:47.210
so, like,
whoever people wants to choose

40:47.279 --> 40:48.812
is whoever
they're gonna choose.

40:48.880 --> 40:52.315
- But the reality is is that
as rookies, we have to come in.

40:52.384 --> 40:53.616
Our back is against the wall.

40:53.685 --> 40:55.852
You got a partner
that didn't get called,

40:55.921 --> 40:57.587
and you've had a nice
cushy ride.

40:57.656 --> 40:59.189
My ride hasn't been like that.
My...

40:59.257 --> 41:00.423
- I don't think...
- Ride has been bumpy.

41:00.492 --> 41:01.891
- Because I haven't been
in elimination

41:01.960 --> 41:03.493
I've had an easy ride.
- My ride has been bumpy,

41:03.562 --> 41:04.994
- Hughie, don't act
like you've had the same ride

41:05.063 --> 41:06.429

- I never said I [bleep] did.

41:06.498 --> 41:07.697

- Just don't compare

41:11.269 --> 41:12.569

41:23.515 --> 41:25.215

41:25.283 --> 41:26.516
The entire room
was looking at me,

41:26.585 --> 41:28.885

41:28.954 --> 41:30.687
I wasn't going to choose
you and Michele today

41:30.755 --> 41:32.422

41:32.491 --> 41:33.957

several times.

41:37.162 --> 41:39.295
