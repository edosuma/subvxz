00:02.560 --> 00:05.640
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family
who lost everything...</i>

00:05.760 --> 00:07.760
<i>and the one son
who had no choice...</i>

00:07.840 --> 00:09.840
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

00:15.160 --> 00:16.840
<i>It's Arrested Development.</i>

00:19.640 --> 00:21.960
The local colleges
are on spring break...

00:22.080 --> 00:24.520
and things are heating up
in Newport Beach.

00:24.640 --> 00:27.640
<i>George Michael was off
from school for two weeks...</i>

00:27.720 --> 00:29.840
<i>and was enjoying spending time
with his uncle.</i>

00:29.920 --> 00:32.360
I'm intercepting
some telepathic energy...

00:32.479 --> 00:35.680
that's telling me
it's the eight of diamonds.

00:35.800 --> 00:38.400
That's amazingly close.

00:38.520 --> 00:40.920
Gee, I got it wrong. Well.

00:41.000 --> 00:43.360
I guess you won
the shirt off my back.

00:43.480 --> 00:46.840
- Okay, that's amazing.
- It's the queen of diamonds.

00:46.920 --> 00:51.440
No, no, no. I had... But if that
had been the actual card...

00:51.520 --> 00:53.920
I'm pretty sure I'd be
almost too blown away.

00:54.040 --> 00:56.600
You know, it's a new trick, so I'm
still kind of tweaking my nipples...

00:56.680 --> 00:59.320
<i>- The presentation was great.
- Hey. Whoa!</i>

00:59.400 --> 01:01.560
What's going on here, huh? George
Michael, you should get to school.

01:01.640 --> 01:04.319
No, we're off for two weeks.
Gob's teaching me some new tricks.

01:04.440 --> 01:07.880
Spring break!
It's my favorite holiday.

01:08.000 --> 01:09.600
Nothing gets me more excited.

01:09.720 --> 01:11.760
I can see that.
You might wanna button that shirt up.

01:11.840 --> 01:14.440
No, I'm good.
Anyway, listen, Michael.

01:14.560 --> 01:16.360
I need the yacht.

01:16.480 --> 01:18.840
I kind of made a commitment.

01:18.920 --> 01:21.080
<i>One year earlier, Gob had appeared...</i>

01:21.160 --> 01:23.120
<i>on a youth-oriented
music network...</i>

01:23.200 --> 01:25.440
<i>Newport Beach. "</i>

01:25.560 --> 01:27.880
Now that I've gotten
your attention...

01:28.000 --> 01:30.360
I'd like to announce
that one year from today...

01:30.480 --> 01:34.800
I shall make that
beautiful yacht disappear.

01:36.800 --> 01:38.560
<i>Wow. He's amazing.</i>

01:38.680 --> 01:42.000
He hasn't done it, and you're
holding a four of spades in your hand.

01:42.080 --> 01:44.280
I don't care.
I'm loving the ride, you know?

01:44.360 --> 01:47.280
- How are you gonna do it?
- Well, you've got two weeks off.

01:47.360 --> 01:49.560
You're about to find out.

01:49.640 --> 01:52.640
Maybe we'll meet a couple
young coeds along the way.

01:52.760 --> 01:56.800
- How young is too young for you?
- That's not gonna happen, okay?

01:56.920 --> 02:00.160
There's not gonna be any coeds. There
certainly isn't gonna be any magic.

02:00.280 --> 02:02.800
It is a path to a lonely life
where people mock you.

02:02.880 --> 02:05.760
- And you don't even realize it.
- Michael, I'm a magi...

02:05.880 --> 02:07.680
I see what you did.

02:07.800 --> 02:11.039
You're not dressed yet? I thought you
were working for me today at the office.

02:11.160 --> 02:13.840
You guys stay open
during spring break?

02:13.920 --> 02:16.120
We're not Orthodox.
But don't worry about it.

02:16.200 --> 02:19.040
Kitty's coming back,
and it's just in time.

02:19.160 --> 02:21.960
Although she's caused nothing but
problems since she's worked for me.

02:22.080 --> 02:24.560
Kitty, isn't that your phone?

02:24.640 --> 02:27.160
<i>No, I'm on the phone with your dad.
That one's your line.</i>

02:29.120 --> 02:31.480
<i>Kitty, these are not
the files I asked for.</i>

02:31.560 --> 02:36.040
Oh, then I don't know
what I shredded.

02:36.160 --> 02:38.560
Have you had a chance
to type up that report yet?

02:38.680 --> 02:42.200
- No, I have been Googling your father.
- So I've heard.

02:45.280 --> 02:47.880
She's been out for two weeks
with this chest thing...

02:48.000 --> 02:50.240
but she's had no problems cashing
the checks I've been sending her.

02:50.360 --> 02:52.440
Speaking of which,
have we gotten anything from Nana?

02:52.520 --> 02:54.800
Buster got a perforated heart
and Gob got that receding hairline...

02:54.880 --> 02:56.720
but you and I pretty much
dodged the bullet.

02:56.800 --> 02:59.840
No, I meant in the mail. She usually
sends checks for Maeby's birthday.

02:59.960 --> 03:03.160
There's been cash coming in?
Have you been holding out on me?

03:03.240 --> 03:05.600
No. No, I've been investing it.

03:05.720 --> 03:07.560
Let's face it.
I'm better with money than you are.

03:07.680 --> 03:11.240
- Better at spending it.
- Okay, I tell you what.

03:11.360 --> 03:14.440
I'll take you down to see Nana
if you split the money with me 60/40.

03:14.560 --> 03:16.320
- 55/55.
- Deal.

03:16.440 --> 03:19.240
Sounds like you guys are
getting more than you think.

03:19.360 --> 03:21.600
We should go now
before your dad gets back.

03:21.720 --> 03:24.160
- No need going halfsies with him too.
- Right.

03:24.280 --> 03:26.240
<i>In fact, Tobias had gone to prison...</i>

03:26.360 --> 03:29.800
<i>to research the role of
Frightened Inmate #2 for a film.</i>

03:29.920 --> 03:32.440
<i>This came at a bad time
for George Sr...</i>

03:32.560 --> 03:35.360
<i>who was in a conflict with a
prisoner named White Power Bill...</i>

03:35.480 --> 03:38.560
<i>a conflict Tobias
inadvertently helped him solve.</i>

03:38.680 --> 03:41.600
I sold you for
a pack of cigarettes.

03:41.720 --> 03:45.080
But didn't you come here
to research the nature of fear?

03:45.200 --> 03:47.240
I can't think of a better
teacher than White Power Bill.

03:47.360 --> 03:49.920
He's like a master's course
unto himself.

03:50.040 --> 03:51.920
So you think I'm a coward.

03:53.400 --> 03:55.520
There's only one man
I've ever called "coward".

03:55.640 --> 03:57.480
That's Brian Doyle-Murray.

03:57.600 --> 04:00.240
<i>No.</i>

04:00.320 --> 04:02.880
What I'm calling you...

04:03.000 --> 04:05.080
is a television actor.

04:05.160 --> 04:06.720
Ouch.

04:06.840 --> 04:08.800
<i>And so, Tobias remained in prison...</i>

04:08.920 --> 04:11.080
<i>as Lindsay and Maeby arrived at Nana's.</i>

04:11.200 --> 04:13.280
Remember,
she's a very old woman.

04:13.400 --> 04:15.960
We're going to get in,
get the cash and get out.

04:17.880 --> 04:20.000
Is this who I think it is?

04:20.120 --> 04:22.160
Nana!

04:22.240 --> 04:25.800
<i>Unfortunately, the woman
who now lived there was not their Nana.</i>

04:25.920 --> 04:29.040
A fact that took Lindsay and Maeby
an hour and a half to ascertain.

04:29.120 --> 04:30.960
Go! Go! It's not her!
Drop the photo album!

04:31.040 --> 04:32.880
- We're not in the photo album!
- Drop the pie!

04:35.480 --> 04:37.680
<i>And Michael arrived at work to find Kitty.</i>

04:37.760 --> 04:39.480
Hey, Kitty, how are you feeling?

04:39.600 --> 04:43.880
Much better.
Man, I was really stuffed up there!

04:44.000 --> 04:46.800
Up here, Michael. Up here.

04:46.880 --> 04:50.280
Why'd you have to get sick now?
What was the rush?

04:50.400 --> 04:52.360
<i>In fact, it was
the previous year's spring break...</i>

04:52.480 --> 04:54.440
<i>that was responsible
for Kitty's rush...</i>

04:54.560 --> 04:57.000
<i>when the makers
of the popular video series...</i>

04:57.120 --> 05:00.680
<i>Girls With Low Self-Esteem,
chose not to include her.</i>

05:01.280 --> 05:03.800
<i>Okay, we got all the good stuffhere.</i>

05:03.880 --> 05:08.640
Let's just say I'm looking forward
to a more successful spring break.

05:08.760 --> 05:11.960
- "Break"? You were just out.
- That was my sick leave.

05:12.040 --> 05:14.240
- This is vacation.
- No, you're not going on vacation.

05:14.360 --> 05:16.560
<i>Oh, yes, I absolutely am!</i>

05:16.640 --> 05:19.680
If you need me,
I will be at Senor Tadpoles...

05:19.800 --> 05:21.960
- having a margarita made in my mouth.
- No, no. Hey.

05:22.080 --> 05:24.000
Kitty, there will be no
margarita in your mouth.

05:24.120 --> 05:26.840
Oh, yes, there absolutely will be
a margarita in my mouth!

05:26.920 --> 05:29.080
Spring break!

05:29.160 --> 05:30.131
- Up here, Michael. Up here.

05:30.132 --> 05:31.760
- Put the shirt back
down and keep on moving.

05:31.840 --> 05:34.240
You're fired.

05:34.360 --> 05:37.520
I work for your father. You don't have
the hiring and firing power.

05:37.600 --> 05:40.880
I absolutely do, and you're fired.

05:40.960 --> 05:45.400
I don't think your father is
gonna be very happy about this.

05:45.520 --> 05:47.960
But take a good look,
'cause it's the last time!

05:51.160 --> 05:52.960
That's the seventh nipple
I've seen today.

05:53.080 --> 05:55.160
<i>And Michael was called to the prison.</i>

05:55.280 --> 05:57.240
<i>What are you doing firing Kitty?
You can't fire Kitty.</i>

05:57.320 --> 05:59.560
- First of all, you don't
have hiring and firing power.

05:59.561 --> 05:59.999
- I do.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.560
- And I had to. She's crazy.
- That's why you don't fire her.

06:02.680 --> 06:04.800
You don't fire crazy.
You never fire crazy.

06:04.920 --> 06:07.800
Dad, she's incompetent.
She's completely unprofessional.

06:07.920 --> 06:12.240
Look, she just came back from
sick leave, uh, with these...

06:12.320 --> 06:15.160
Oh, my God, you paid
for those, didn't you?

06:15.240 --> 06:18.920
You got carried away. Hell,
I've been so corrupted by my power...

06:19.040 --> 06:21.680
that I even enjoyed
firing my own twin brother.

06:21.760 --> 06:23.760
You should have seen his face
when he was begging me not to.

06:23.840 --> 06:25.760
Well, he's my twin brother.
I can show you.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.800
It was funny.
But, you know...

06:33.920 --> 06:36.360
Kitty had access
to all kinds of information.

06:36.480 --> 06:38.080
God knows what she poked
her nose into.

06:38.200 --> 06:40.760
There's enough evidence
on this boat to put me away.

06:40.840 --> 06:43.200
The only real thing
I have...

06:44.840 --> 06:47.520
Oh, God, there's nothing
to hold on to down there.

06:47.640 --> 06:49.560
- You're like a boy.
- What's wrong with you?

06:49.640 --> 06:52.960
All these books are cooked!

06:54.600 --> 06:58.120
- I'm sorry. I gotta do my job.
- And I gotta get out of prison.

06:58.240 --> 07:00.640
Next time someone threatens me,
I may not have a son-in-law to offer.

07:00.760 --> 07:02.800
I can't come in here
all the t... "Offer"?

07:02.880 --> 07:05.120
I may not have a son-in-law
to offer me counseling.

07:05.240 --> 07:08.640
You know, he should have stayed a shrink.
He's very gifted, you know.

07:08.760 --> 07:12.760
<i>In fact, Tobias had even
produced a videotape...</i>

07:12.840 --> 07:15.640
<i>but its brief success
was due to its misleading name.</i>

07:17.160 --> 07:20.480
<i>Once this was discovered,
all but 10 of the videos were returned.</i>

07:20.600 --> 07:23.800
Hire Kitty back, okay?
For the company. No, no.

07:25.840 --> 07:29.000
For me, Michael.

07:29.120 --> 07:32.120
- It is kind of a funny face.
- Oh, come on, now.

07:37.960 --> 07:42.240
There's just absolutely no purse
that will go with this outfit.

07:42.320 --> 07:44.480
You've got a little pocket
there, Annyong.

07:44.600 --> 07:45.960
<i>Annyong.</i>

07:46.080 --> 07:47.880
That's not getting old.

07:48.000 --> 07:51.120
- Where's Nana?
- I sent her on a wonderful cruise.

07:51.200 --> 07:53.040
You just missed
a wonderful call from her.

07:53.120 --> 07:57.160
She just came back from a wonderful
costume party that the captain threw.

07:57.280 --> 07:59.640
She gained 10 pounds...
there's so much food on that boat.

07:59.720 --> 08:01.720
She's up to 74!

08:01.840 --> 08:03.880
It's wonderful, just wonderful.

08:04.000 --> 08:07.840
<i>In fact, Lucille's mother
had been dead for six months.</i>

08:07.960 --> 08:10.240
She tried pesto
for the first time.

08:10.360 --> 08:12.440
Can you believe that?

08:12.560 --> 08:15.800
Ninety-two years old,
and she never tried pesto.

08:15.880 --> 08:19.520
<i>Lucille feared that the family would come
after the inheritance if they found out.</i>

08:19.640 --> 08:21.440
Was she on the phone, Annyong?

08:23.800 --> 08:25.920
<i>Annyong.</i>

08:26.040 --> 08:27.680
Emery board.

08:29.160 --> 08:32.480
Isn't he great?
And he goes with everything.

08:32.600 --> 08:36.640
<i>Meanwhile, Gob was adjusting
to a new companion ofhis own.</i>

08:36.760 --> 08:39.159
<i>That's not the end of the trick.
There's a big surprise coming.</i>

08:39.240 --> 08:41.280
Take your T-shirt off, please.

08:41.400 --> 08:44.400
What? Oh, you changed the trick.
It's a different trick.

08:44.480 --> 08:48.480
If I roll up this T-shirt,
put it in this hat...

08:48.600 --> 08:51.240
<i>Gob! Hey, George Michael.</i>

08:51.360 --> 08:52.800
Hang on. We're in
the middle of something.

08:52.920 --> 08:55.720
If you'll be so kind as to
expose your breast, please.

08:55.840 --> 08:58.960
No, no, no, no, no, no! Hey,
what the hell are you doing?

08:59.040 --> 09:01.520
Dad, it's misdirection. You're supposed
to keep your eye on the shirt in the hat.

09:01.600 --> 09:04.760
Get downstairs right now.
Come on.

09:04.840 --> 09:06.445
- Buddy, what are you doing here?

09:06.446 --> 09:09.120
- I'm dying to see how he
makes this yacht disappear.

09:09.240 --> 09:11.040
He's not going to make
the yacht disappear. I told him that.

09:11.160 --> 09:14.720
It's driving me crazy. It's like a mind
puzzle, an awesome mind puzzle.

09:14.840 --> 09:16.640
<i>Michael looked at his son and saw...</i>

09:16.760 --> 09:19.200
<i>that he truly was inspired
by his uncle...</i>

09:19.320 --> 09:22.080
<i>that perhaps the boy
actually admired him.</i>

09:22.200 --> 09:24.680
I gotta get you out of here. You're
gonna come work with me at the office.

09:24.800 --> 09:26.680
Go wait in the stair car.

09:26.760 --> 09:29.147
Hey, I want you to
explain something to me.

09:29.148 --> 09:30.720
I'm out looking for Kitty...

09:30.840 --> 09:34.160
<i>and I find my son in the middle of
a Girls With Low Self-Esteem video.</i>

09:34.240 --> 09:36.760
Don't worry. He's gonna be covered
with a blue dot. He approached me.

09:36.840 --> 09:39.160
And as for Kitty,
I think you're crazy to have fired her.

09:39.240 --> 09:41.160
Who knows what kind
of information she has?

09:41.280 --> 09:44.200
He's my brother,
and he's never even said "Good job. "

09:44.320 --> 09:46.240
I just want him to love me,
you know?

09:46.360 --> 09:50.160
Wow, you get really girlie after, huh?

09:50.240 --> 09:53.840
Yeah, she definitely knows way too much.
Well, go get her. It's the holidays.

09:53.920 --> 09:56.320
- I'm sure she's down at Senor Tadpoles.
- Right.

09:56.440 --> 09:58.320
Having a cocktail made
in her mouth. All right.

09:58.400 --> 10:01.600
I'm gonna go take care of that.
In the meantime, stay away from my son.

10:01.720 --> 10:03.560
<i>Wow, Michael, I'm really hurt.</i>

10:03.680 --> 10:06.440
<i>It's family. What's more important
than family, Michael?</i>

10:06.560 --> 10:08.960
- This yacht?
- Of course not, Gob.

10:09.080 --> 10:11.120
You'd make the deal?
Because I'd sign off on that right now.

10:11.200 --> 10:14.480
<i>I stay away from your son,:
you let me use the yacht.</i>

10:14.560 --> 10:16.680
The holidays really brings out
the best in you.

10:16.800 --> 10:18.240
Well...

10:18.360 --> 10:20.600
<i>Meanwhile, Tobias found
his experience as a therapist...</i>

10:20.680 --> 10:22.520
<i>was helping him deal
with his new cell mate.</i>

10:22.600 --> 10:24.520
<i>Yes, but where does
the hate come from, Bill?</i>

10:24.640 --> 10:28.280
- What causes it?
- TheJews, I guess.

10:28.360 --> 10:30.200
Sure. But I think you need
to look deeper.

10:30.280 --> 10:32.160
I think these are issues
of self-esteem.

10:32.280 --> 10:34.560
<i>I know what it's like.
I know how it feels...</i>

10:34.680 --> 10:37.120
to have a father,
or, in my case, a father-in-law...

10:37.240 --> 10:39.040
who doesn't respect you.

10:39.160 --> 10:41.240
"Anyhoo," we have very
little time...

10:41.320 --> 10:44.000
before this, uh, 4:00 pounding
you promised me.

10:44.120 --> 10:46.160
I'm gonna take a shot
at something and say...

10:46.240 --> 10:49.800
that I think you hate
White Power Bill.

10:49.920 --> 10:53.440
- I hate you!
- You hate White Power Bill.

10:53.560 --> 10:56.960
- I hate the government!
- You hate White Power Bill.

10:57.080 --> 11:01.600
<i>I hate my father!
- Recreation. All prisoners, one hour.</i>

11:01.720 --> 11:05.320
Go get 'em.

11:06.680 --> 11:09.400
I hate White Power Bill.

11:09.480 --> 11:12.000
<i>I got a prisoner down! Prisoner down!</i>

11:12.120 --> 11:14.720
- You killed him.
- Well, I...

11:14.840 --> 11:18.200
Like Dorothy.
The Wicked Witch is dead.

11:18.280 --> 11:21.720
All hail Dorothy!

11:21.800 --> 11:26.040
<i>And at an elegant restaurant,
Michael asked Kitty to come back.</i>

11:26.120 --> 11:30.400
Who are you asking back, Michael?
Me? Or these?

11:30.520 --> 11:31.652
I want you all back.

11:31.653 --> 11:34.200
I want the whole gang.
Okay? Please, Kitty?

11:34.280 --> 11:36.320
I'm trying
real hard here, you know.

11:36.440 --> 11:39.960
Can we just make believe that none of
this ever happened and just start fresh?

11:40.080 --> 11:42.080
Michael, of course I'll come back.

11:42.200 --> 11:44.000
'Cause I never really left...

11:44.120 --> 11:46.480
because we both know
that you can't fire people.

11:46.560 --> 11:48.720
No, I did fire you,
and now I'm hiring you back.

11:48.800 --> 11:50.960
You don't have authority
over me.

11:51.040 --> 11:53.600
- They don't have nachos here.
- You know what? Why don't we forget it?

11:53.720 --> 11:55.840
Because I've been trying to be
very, very generous to you...

11:55.960 --> 11:58.760
and you don't respect me,
so I'm firing you, okay?

11:58.880 --> 12:02.920
- You are fired.
- All right, Michael.

12:03.040 --> 12:05.440
But I know where things are
and you don't...

12:05.560 --> 12:09.360
and you are asking
for a whole world of trouble.

12:09.440 --> 12:11.560
If you're threatening me,
you're gonna be very sorry.

12:11.680 --> 12:12.652
- Are you threatening me?

12:12.653 --> 12:14.480
- Yeah, that's a threat.
I'm threatening you.

12:14.560 --> 12:17.760
Did you hear that everyone?
Michael Bluth is threatening me!

12:17.880 --> 12:21.040
I've gotta get out of here.
I'm a part of the story.

12:21.120 --> 12:24.080
I can't be a part of the story.
I can't be a part of the story.

12:24.160 --> 12:27.640
Say good-bye
to your company, Michael.

12:27.720 --> 12:29.880
- And say good-bye to these.
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

12:29.960 --> 12:31.800
'Cause it's the last time.

12:35.000 --> 12:40.280
A woman shows all during a fracas
at a local restaurant, sources say.

12:44.000 --> 12:47.200
<i>George Michael was working
harder than ever over his spring break...</i>

12:47.280 --> 12:49.920
<i>filling in for the now
twice-fired Kitty.</i>

12:50.040 --> 12:52.120
Look at us working together.
You get the hang of this...

12:52.200 --> 12:54.320
and this could be your summer.

12:54.400 --> 12:56.320
I don't know, Dad. I really wanted
to see Gob's magic show and...

12:56.440 --> 13:00.320
No, you don't. Isn't this much more fun,
working with your Dad?

13:00.440 --> 13:02.560
- It's just, there was some other...
- You gonna get that?

13:04.440 --> 13:06.240
- Thanks, Laura.
- Good afternoon. Bluth Company.

13:06.360 --> 13:09.760
Talk you off?
Talk you off what, Pop-Pop?

13:11.080 --> 13:13.280
George Michael.
I thought you were, um...

13:13.400 --> 13:16.400
When's that voice gonna drop?
Where's Kitty?

13:16.480 --> 13:19.680
I think Dad fired her again.
He wants to talk to you.

13:19.800 --> 13:23.080
I don't wanna talk to him.
I made my decision, and that's that.

13:23.200 --> 13:26.840
Oh, you heard?
Yeah. All right.

13:30.120 --> 13:31.098
- What did he say?

13:31.099 --> 13:33.760
- If I clean it up, it's
not really a sentence.

13:33.880 --> 13:36.840
<i>And so, George Sr. made another call.</i>

13:36.960 --> 13:40.200
Kitty's on the loose. I need you
to make something disappear for me.

13:40.320 --> 13:43.320
just some books in that cooler
marked "Maddas. "

13:43.440 --> 13:45.880
<i>- Great.
- George Sr. hung up...</i>

13:45.960 --> 13:48.880
<i>confident that his problems
would finally be taken care of.</i>

13:48.960 --> 13:50.880
Hey, LittleJustice.

13:50.960 --> 13:53.680
You, uh, painted your shoes red.

13:53.760 --> 13:56.960
Call me the Tin Man.
I'm a Friend of Dorothy's now.

13:57.080 --> 14:00.400
<i>- And she wants to see you.
- And back at the office...</i>

14:00.480 --> 14:04.000
<i>Lindsay arrived with her daughter
and her mounting suspicions.</i>

14:04.120 --> 14:06.840
Mom says she sent Nana on a cruise.

14:06.920 --> 14:08.680
You're still on this?
How much was in those birthday cards?

14:08.800 --> 14:11.520
It's not about the money,
Michael. It's about Nana.

14:11.640 --> 14:13.440
I think Mom sent her
to a nursing home...

14:13.560 --> 14:16.200
some gray, windowless room...
against her will.

14:16.320 --> 14:19.640
- So what was it like out there today?
- Nice. Sunny.

14:19.720 --> 14:21.440
Wow.

14:21.560 --> 14:23.960
So, how do you think Gob's gonna
make this yacht disappear?

14:24.040 --> 14:26.520
Well, I'll be working here,
so I guess I'll never know.

14:26.600 --> 14:28.680
The only real way to find out
how it's done...

14:28.800 --> 14:30.600
is to sneak on the boat
while he does it.

14:30.720 --> 14:33.520
But if he makes it disappear,
won't everyone see me standing there?

14:33.600 --> 14:38.640
Let's just sit quietly and consider
how ridiculous that statement was.

14:40.800 --> 14:43.040
Anyways, if it was me,
that's what I would do.

14:43.160 --> 14:44.960
I wanna check out
Mom's financial activity.

14:45.080 --> 14:47.040
Call her banks,
maybe run a hospital search.

14:47.160 --> 14:49.240
<i>It's gonna mean a lot of
hard work, but I'll put somebody on it.</i>

14:49.320 --> 14:52.120
George Michael.

14:52.200 --> 14:54.440
Where is George Michael?

14:54.560 --> 14:56.400
<i>In fact, at Maeby's suggestion...</i>

14:56.480 --> 14:59.000
<i>George Michael was off to visit
his Uncle Gob.</i>

14:59.120 --> 15:00.960
Hi, Uncle Gob.
I came by to see...

15:01.080 --> 15:03.040
if you need any help
with your magic show.

15:03.160 --> 15:03.592
- Great.

15:03.593 --> 15:06.240
- I think it's so great
that you're doing this.

15:06.360 --> 15:09.720
- I'm prepping right now.
- How'd you get my Dad's permission?

15:09.800 --> 15:11.520
<i>Suddenly, Gob remembered
the promise he had made...</i>

15:11.640 --> 15:13.480
<i>to stay away from Michael's son.</i>

15:13.600 --> 15:16.000
None of your damn business.
Get the hell out of here.

15:16.120 --> 15:17.960
- What?
- You don't have the magic in you!

15:18.080 --> 15:19.880
You never did!
You don't have it here!

15:21.520 --> 15:24.480
So take a look. It's the last time
you're gonna see these.

15:26.720 --> 15:28.840
- Sorry, kid, more than you'll ever...
- What?

15:28.960 --> 15:29.684
<i>Beat it!</i>

15:29.685 --> 15:33.240
- As Gob was forced to send
away someone he loved...

15:33.360 --> 15:36.000
<i>- You'll be missed.
- George Sr. was forced to visit...</i>

15:36.120 --> 15:39.640
<i>someone he had once tried
to shove out of a moving car.</i>

15:40.960 --> 15:43.720
- Welcome.
- You're Dorothy?

15:43.840 --> 15:46.720
I thought the two of us
could talk, man-on-man.

15:48.000 --> 15:50.840
<i>I'm afraid I'm serious.</i>

15:50.960 --> 15:52.840
<i>I bought you.</i>

15:54.680 --> 15:56.569
- Remember to let it
steep for five minutes.

15:56.570 --> 15:57.319
- Oh, dear God.

15:57.320 --> 15:59.200
I've been in this family
for 16 years...

15:59.320 --> 16:01.440
and I don't think we've
ever had a conversation.

16:01.560 --> 16:03.800
- I'm not gonna discuss this.
- You hate me.

16:03.880 --> 16:06.360
Yeah, I do hate you.
You took my daughter...

16:06.480 --> 16:08.920
my precious little girl...
and moved her away...

16:09.000 --> 16:12.120
and now I'm here, and I am afraid
I will never get her back.

16:12.200 --> 16:14.680
Afraid. You're afraid.

16:14.760 --> 16:17.120
Fear has turned into hate.

16:17.240 --> 16:20.480
So Frightened Inmate #2
isn't frightened at all.

16:20.600 --> 16:24.440
He's angry.
He's a crabby old coot...

16:24.520 --> 16:26.440
and he needs love...

16:26.560 --> 16:28.640
just like everyone.

16:28.760 --> 16:30.680
Get your...
hands off of me.

16:30.760 --> 16:33.520
Shh. Don't be scared.

16:40.920 --> 16:43.480
<i>And on the beach,
the show was beginning.</i>

16:49.400 --> 16:54.080
<i>Any magician can make
the queen of diamonds disappear...</i>

16:54.160 --> 16:57.480
but what about a whole boat?

17:19.839 --> 17:23.079
<i>Mom, have you seen
George Michael?</i>

17:23.200 --> 17:25.520
We just got here.
I couldn't find my keys.

17:25.599 --> 17:27.520
- I can never find anything in here.
- We love you!

17:28.960 --> 17:33.240
Where once there was a yacht,
now there is naught!

17:44.200 --> 17:48.480
- All right. So how'd you do it?
- Michael, a magician never reveals his...

17:48.560 --> 17:50.760
I sunk it!
I sunk the yacht!

17:50.880 --> 17:54.600
<i>At least I think I sunk it. I mean,
I blew it up, and I don't see it anywhere.</i>

17:54.720 --> 17:57.040
My heart was in my throat when
that curtain came down and...

17:57.120 --> 17:58.960
- You sank the yacht?
- Shh!

17:59.040 --> 18:02.480
- You sunk a $700,000 yacht?
- $900,000 worth of insurance on it.

18:02.560 --> 18:06.000
And got rid of the evidence.
How about a "good job"?

18:06.080 --> 18:09.320
<i>Seeing a window of opportunity,
Lucille made a startling announcement.</i>

18:09.440 --> 18:11.840
- Nana was on that yacht!
- What?

18:11.960 --> 18:14.400
<i>- You killed Nana!
- She's lying!</i>

18:14.520 --> 18:16.640
Nana wasn't on that yacht.
She's fine.

18:16.760 --> 18:19.240
<i>She's been dead for six months.
- Lindsay had learned this information...</i>

18:19.360 --> 18:20.319
<i>- For about six months.</i>

18:20.320 --> 18:22.200
- when she spoke to the
family's personal banker.

18:22.280 --> 18:24.560
<i>Later, fearing that
Lindsay was onto her...</i>

18:24.640 --> 18:26.480
<i>Lucille went to the bank herself.</i>

18:26.560 --> 18:29.640
<i>There must be somewhere I can put
this money where it can't be touched.</i>

18:29.760 --> 18:31.800
I suppose you could keep it
in your purse.

18:31.880 --> 18:34.880
Very funny, but I'm
not carrying a purse.

18:35.000 --> 18:36.960
<i>Where's the money, Mom?
I want the money.</i>

18:37.080 --> 18:40.600
You can't have it.
It's in a trust fund for Annyong.

18:40.680 --> 18:42.240
<i>- Annyong.
- No one can touch it but me...</i>

18:42.360 --> 18:45.000
and I retain control of it
until he's 18.

18:45.120 --> 18:47.280
I don't know what's more offensive...
the fact you didn't tell us...

18:47.360 --> 18:51.240
<i>about our grandmother's death
or that you sunk a $ 700,000 yacht!</i>

18:51.360 --> 18:54.120
<i>Stop lecturing me.
I just lost my mother.</i>

18:54.240 --> 18:56.320
I'm so glad George Michael
wasn't here to see any of this.

18:56.440 --> 18:58.720
Maeby, where is George Michael?

18:58.840 --> 19:03.440
Um, well, if he's not here, I'd just
have to say he's probably on the yacht.

19:03.520 --> 19:05.320
On the yacht?

19:05.440 --> 19:07.800
<i>In fact, George Michael
had boarded the yacht.</i>

19:07.920 --> 19:11.320
<i>But when he saw the evidence
of Gob's lifestyle...</i>

19:11.440 --> 19:14.520
<i>he realized that this perhaps
was not the life he wanted.</i>

19:14.600 --> 19:17.000
<i>While Kitty went in search
of retribution...</i>

19:17.120 --> 19:19.600
<i>in the form of the files
in the cooler.</i>

19:19.680 --> 19:22.800
<i>George Michael's a good kid.
I'm sure he's at the office.</i>

19:22.880 --> 19:24.720
Right. I told him
to stay away from you.

19:24.800 --> 19:28.240
- I told you to stay away from him!
- I tried. I told him to get out.

19:28.320 --> 19:30.160
Bluth Company.
George Michael speaking, not Kitty.

19:30.240 --> 19:33.200
- Thank God you're there.
- I don't need a real spring break.

19:33.280 --> 19:36.840
I really think I am much better off here
alone in this office.

19:36.960 --> 19:40.240
<i>Michael realized
what he had done to his son...</i>

19:40.360 --> 19:42.200
<i>so he came up with a solution.</i>

19:42.280 --> 19:44.440
- You're fired.
- Really?

19:44.520 --> 19:46.680
Can you fire people?

19:46.800 --> 19:48.640
Yeah. Go have a spring break.

19:48.760 --> 19:51.080
Thanks, Dad.

19:51.200 --> 19:52.800
Are you sure you're gonna
be okay without Kitty?

19:52.920 --> 19:55.360
Don't you worry.
She'll turn up.

20:02.280 --> 20:04.960
<i>On the next
Arrested Development.</i>

20:05.080 --> 20:07.920
<i>Lupe makes
a startling discovery.</i>

20:08.000 --> 20:11.680
Oh, so that makes
Annyong 18.

20:11.800 --> 20:14.160
<i>And Michael finds himself
in the middle of the search...</i>

20:14.240 --> 20:16.200
<i>for a missing Kitty.</i>

20:16.320 --> 20:17.880
Well, we have a restaurant
full of people saying...

20:18.000 --> 20:19.760
that you threatened Kitty
the last time she was seen.

20:19.840 --> 20:22.000
How does anybody
even remember this?

20:22.080 --> 20:25.907
- She showed her knobs
in the steakhouse, sir.

20:25.908 --> 20:26.708
- She...
