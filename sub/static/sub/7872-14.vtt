12:08.495 --> 12:09.994
You're welcome.

12:09.996 --> 12:12.430
You know, if you really want to
get your belly button pierced,

12:12.432 --> 12:14.265
go see a professional.

12:14.267 --> 12:15.400
I'm ready
for you, babe.

12:15.402 --> 12:16.701
(clacking)

12:16.703 --> 12:17.869
I'm gonna have
this done properly,

12:17.871 --> 12:19.938
at a kiosk in the mall.

12:19.940 --> 12:21.306
I'm Shauna.

12:23.943 --> 12:25.877
Welcome to Springfield
Nuclear, Szyslak.

12:25.879 --> 12:27.412
We'll start you off
in Janitorial,

12:27.414 --> 12:29.414
but there is room
for advancement.

12:29.416 --> 12:31.783
Hey, I sure appreciate
this, fellas.

12:31.785 --> 12:34.419
What you guys did to me,
then for me,

12:34.421 --> 12:36.187
I'll never forget-slash-forgive,

12:36.189 --> 12:37.422
so thanks a lot.

12:37.424 --> 12:39.724
Also...
(angrily): thanks a lot!

12:39.726 --> 12:41.059
<i>What's for dinner, Mom?</i>

12:41.061 --> 12:44.696
I-I'm-I'm sorry,
but I'm not your mother.

12:44.698 --> 12:46.564
Hey, <i>I'm</i> the one payin'.

12:46.566 --> 12:48.533
Fine! There's meat loaf.

12:48.535 --> 12:51.703
Mmm! What's meat loaf?

12:51.705 --> 12:53.872
Left... left, left!

12:53.874 --> 12:55.406
Left...

12:55.408 --> 12:56.608
Left, left!

12:56.610 --> 12:58.309
<i>Left, left!</i>

12:58.311 --> 12:59.878
<i>Eh... left!</i>

12:59.880 --> 13:01.880
Flamingos turn pink
from eating shrimp.

13:01.882 --> 13:03.915
Cats have over
a hundred vocal cords.

13:03.917 --> 13:05.450
The Golden Gate Bridge
is the longest span

13:05.452 --> 13:07.085
between two towers.

13:07.087 --> 13:08.887
Why are you telling me
all these things?

13:08.889 --> 13:10.288
Isn't this <i>Cash Cab?</i>

13:10.290 --> 13:11.289
No!

13:11.291 --> 13:13.658
Oh! It's never <i>Cash Cab.</i>

13:13.660 --> 13:16.094
Oh...

13:16.096 --> 13:17.462
Faster!

13:17.464 --> 13:18.463
Eh, slower.

13:18.465 --> 13:19.798
Hard a-port!

13:19.800 --> 13:21.966
Disco Stu
says hang a "U"!

13:21.968 --> 13:23.768
Make a louie
up here at the...

13:23.770 --> 13:25.336
Stop sign!
Blood bank!

13:25.338 --> 13:26.738
Girl with big...

13:26.740 --> 13:28.006
...punching bags?

13:28.008 --> 13:31.109
So, for the love of God,
get me to Mexico!

13:31.111 --> 13:34.312
Hey, swabbie, you've
missed spots there,

13:34.314 --> 13:36.815
another one there,
and... there!

13:36.817 --> 13:38.850
Every other spot
is be-grimed!

13:38.852 --> 13:41.986
It's called a checkerboard
floor, ya unwrapped mummy.

13:41.988 --> 13:43.621
You're f...
Sir...

13:43.623 --> 13:46.090
the NRC is here
for a surprise inspection.

13:46.092 --> 13:48.426
We are gonna search this place
from top to bottom.

13:48.428 --> 13:50.762
(shrieks) That's where
all the problems are.

13:50.764 --> 13:52.096
I'll handle this, uh...

13:52.098 --> 13:53.264
You're the head
inspector, huh?

13:53.266 --> 13:54.632
Yes, I am.

13:54.634 --> 13:56.501
How come, on your badge,
you got a mustache,

13:56.503 --> 13:58.269
but now you're not
wearing one, huh?

13:58.271 --> 14:01.005
Oh, I was Freddie Mercury
in a Queen cover band,

14:01.007 --> 14:03.441
but, uh, then I got demoted
to Brian May.

14:03.443 --> 14:04.709
Yeah, well, I'm thrilled

14:04.711 --> 14:06.377
for your musical career
and everything,

14:06.379 --> 14:08.446
but, uh, we got no way of
knowing that this is you.

14:08.448 --> 14:09.881
I mean, we gotta be
careful here.

14:09.883 --> 14:12.617
This is one of them, uh,
highly sensitive joints.

14:14.320 --> 14:16.988
It'll take me weeks
to grow that mustache back.

14:16.990 --> 14:18.957
Or years, to get a new badge!

14:18.959 --> 14:20.859
Yeah, well, that's
your problem, ain't it?

14:20.861 --> 14:22.794
You will see us again,

14:22.796 --> 14:24.929
in God knows when.

14:28.801 --> 14:31.469
Young man, how do you fit
such brilliance

14:31.471 --> 14:33.638
into such an ugly,
ethnic head?

14:33.640 --> 14:36.474
Well, if you own a bar,
you either keep it clean

14:36.476 --> 14:38.309
or learn to deal
with inspectors.

14:38.311 --> 14:39.878
And Moe don't clean.

14:39.880 --> 14:41.846
Interesting attitude
for a janitor.

14:41.848 --> 14:44.916
What say we make you
the new supervisor
of Sector 7G?

14:44.918 --> 14:46.584
Me, a supervisor?

14:46.586 --> 14:48.486
I feel like I overdosed
and went to heaven!

14:48.488 --> 14:49.754
(laughs)

14:55.094 --> 14:57.695
Those smart cars are
cutting into our business.

14:57.697 --> 14:59.764
We used to get uber
amounts of work

14:59.766 --> 15:01.199
giving people lifts.

15:01.201 --> 15:02.500
(splutters)

15:02.502 --> 15:04.569
I come to America to drive taxi.

15:04.571 --> 15:07.171
Now my cab sits empty,
like Sochi Marriott.

15:07.173 --> 15:10.842
Well, boss, the main
problem is Marge Simpson!

15:10.844 --> 15:14.846
She's prompt, courteous
and a joy to ride with.

15:14.848 --> 15:16.848
How do you know so much?

15:16.850 --> 15:19.617
Oh, she, uh, drives me
to work every day.

15:19.619 --> 15:21.519
And unlike the rest
of you cowards,

15:21.521 --> 15:24.522
she's not afraid
to parallel park.

15:25.891 --> 15:27.959
(laughing, whooping)

15:29.461 --> 15:31.296
Whoa, fellas,
that is not acceptable.

15:31.298 --> 15:32.864
This is a nuclear plant!

15:32.866 --> 15:33.932
(grunts)

15:35.100 --> 15:36.868
Huh. No one was in there.

15:36.870 --> 15:40.305
Look, Moe, the least
you could let me do
is anything I want.

15:40.307 --> 15:42.240
All right, let me be
honest with youse.

15:42.242 --> 15:45.543
After all the money this plant
lost on that nitwit, Elon Musk,

15:45.545 --> 15:46.945
they're looking for cutbacks,

15:46.947 --> 15:49.147
so I've been going
over your record.

15:49.149 --> 15:50.148
(whimpers):
Oh...!

15:50.150 --> 15:51.749
Yeah, the only reason

15:51.751 --> 15:53.651
you haven't been fired
is because your file here

15:53.653 --> 15:55.987
was holding up a sofa
that was missing a leg.

15:55.989 --> 15:58.890
Well, that's the logic--
where's the affection?

15:58.892 --> 16:01.592
Well, as supervisor, I can't
fraternize with the, uh,

16:01.594 --> 16:02.593
uh, what's the word...?

16:02.595 --> 16:04.095
Scum.

16:04.097 --> 16:06.965
Anyway, because I am
your friend, you are safe.

16:06.967 --> 16:08.900
But... you're gonna
be reassigned.

16:08.902 --> 16:12.737
Smithers, "what profit a man
if he gain the world,

16:12.739 --> 16:14.839
and lose his soul?"

16:14.841 --> 16:16.441
Seriously,
I need an amount.

16:16.443 --> 16:17.775
In round dollars.

16:17.777 --> 16:18.776
(knocking on door)

16:18.778 --> 16:19.944
Plant watering guy.

16:19.946 --> 16:21.346
Yes, yes, go ahead.

16:21.348 --> 16:23.114
Uh, and be careful
with the Venus flytrap.

16:23.116 --> 16:24.349
All right.

16:25.918 --> 16:28.252
They say you catch
more flies with honey.

16:28.254 --> 16:30.421
I say, with flytraps.

16:30.423 --> 16:31.923
(muffled):
What do I do now?

16:31.925 --> 16:33.324
Just lean into it.

16:33.326 --> 16:35.193
It'll be over soon,
one way or another.

16:35.195 --> 16:37.362
(muffled):
Oh, all right.

16:37.364 --> 16:39.831
D'oh.

16:44.536 --> 16:47.005
Hey, guys, you mind
if I join you?

16:47.007 --> 16:50.041
They ran out of Beaujolais Cru
in the executive dining room

16:50.043 --> 16:53.344
and I ain't drinkin' white
with my coq-au-freakin'-vin.

16:53.346 --> 16:55.313
I think I'd rather
sit somewhere else.

16:55.315 --> 16:57.949
Yeah, I'm gonna take
my lunch back to the core.

16:57.951 --> 17:00.284
Now they won't even
have lunch with me?

17:00.286 --> 17:04.322
Well, you know, people <i>can</i>
<i>kind of act like they're</i>
<i>in grade school.</i>

17:04.324 --> 17:05.823
Oh, now you gotta throw

17:05.825 --> 17:07.392
your grade school
education in my face?

17:07.394 --> 17:09.394
You know, Moe,
you're a real jerk!

17:09.396 --> 17:11.696
I didn't mind so much
when it came with beer!

17:12.664 --> 17:13.998
I don't need youse!

17:14.000 --> 17:16.868
I'm all the company I need! Heh!

17:18.337 --> 17:19.737
Oh! Oh!

17:19.739 --> 17:21.439
I just lost my appetite.

17:23.008 --> 17:25.743
Marge, which can
makes me look cooler--

17:25.745 --> 17:27.545
the Drizzler or Mr. Drip?

17:27.547 --> 17:29.580
(Marge groans wearily)

17:29.582 --> 17:31.916
Aw, your leaves
are drooping.

20:03.036 --> 20:04.802
jerking our suds
again, Moe.

20:06.004 --> 20:07.972
Yeah, I figured out that
the best way

20:07.974 --> 20:09.640
for me to get along
with most people

20:09.642 --> 20:11.809
is to be kept behind
a two-foot trunk of solid oak.

20:11.811 --> 20:12.843

20:12.845 --> 20:14.845

poplar to me.
