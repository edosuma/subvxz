WEBVTT

01:13.657 --> 01:15.022
I ook what I found.

01:17.619 --> 01:18.619
Candy!

01:19.538 --> 01:21.403
Gunnery sergeant gorski.

01:22.749 --> 01:24.159
Yes, ma'am?

01:25.210 --> 01:28.043
I'm confident my daughter
will appreciate some female company.

01:28.130 --> 01:30.542
- Yes, ma'am.
- Shall we proceed, Mr. laughlin?

01:32.384 --> 01:34.215
Come on, nira. Let's get comfy.

01:35.929 --> 01:37.544
Secure vip's daughter
in eagle three.

01:37.639 --> 01:38.674
Copy that, chief.

01:39.683 --> 01:42.140
Mr. Collins,
let's go over the presentation.

01:42.227 --> 01:43.888
This is so pretty.

01:43.979 --> 01:47.016
All teams, this is six.
Radio check over.

01:47.107 --> 01:48.847
Eagle one, Roger. Out.

01:48.942 --> 01:50.557
Eagle two, Roger. Out.

01:50.652 --> 01:52.233
Eagle three, Roger. Out.

01:53.488 --> 01:55.353
Eagle four, Roger. Out.

01:55.449 --> 01:58.941
Eagle nine, this is eagle six.
Radio check, over.

02:54.675 --> 02:57.963
How come there's so many cars
with us today?

02:58.053 --> 03:00.214
To make sure you and your mommy
are super safe.

03:01.223 --> 03:02.383
Okay.

03:04.851 --> 03:07.183
Can I have another piece of candy?

03:07.270 --> 03:09.261
- You're gonna get me in trouble.
- Yes.

03:11.733 --> 03:12.813
All right, just one.

03:14.277 --> 03:15.277
Thank you.

03:21.034 --> 03:23.025
We may have a situation.

03:23.120 --> 03:24.640
Grouping in the woods
at three o'clock.

03:28.875 --> 03:30.115
Yeah, that's an all clear.

03:42.305 --> 03:43.305
Holy... no!

03:56.236 --> 03:57.596
Johnson, take the lead!
Go, go, go!

04:21.470 --> 04:23.506
- Ali?
- Nothing is gonna happen to you, okay?

04:23.597 --> 04:25.007
Nothing is gonna happen to you.

04:26.683 --> 04:28.173
Is nira all right?

04:33.690 --> 04:35.090
Back it up! Back it up! Back it up!

05:00.091 --> 05:01.501
All right, sweetie.

05:01.593 --> 05:03.675
Sweetie, I need you to sit here
and stay low, okay?

05:28.370 --> 05:29.655
Come on. Let's go!

05:32.791 --> 05:34.076
- Mommy!
- It's okay.

06:39.983 --> 06:43.191
- So when'd you get back?
- To New York?

06:43.278 --> 06:44.518
About a week.

06:46.156 --> 06:47.612
Do you have a place to stay?

06:49.451 --> 06:50.782
What about a job?

06:51.786 --> 06:52.992
Hmm.

06:53.079 --> 06:55.320
It wasn't exactly a parade
welcoming me home.

06:57.459 --> 06:59.871
Well, I missed you at the funeral.

07:02.505 --> 07:03.870
They wouldn't let me go.

07:05.091 --> 07:06.501
What, for your sister?

07:06.593 --> 07:08.925
Non sibi sed patriae.

07:09.012 --> 07:13.346
- Not self, but country and all that.
- That's Navy, not us.

07:14.476 --> 07:16.137
It seemed to make sense at the time.

07:19.481 --> 07:22.063
You know, the kids would benefit from
having their aunt around.

07:24.152 --> 07:25.688
Any interest in seeing them?

07:27.489 --> 07:28.489
Jon?

07:35.205 --> 07:36.411
Okay then.

07:38.541 --> 07:42.159
There's an opening at the apartment
building where I'm working.

07:42.253 --> 07:43.789
It's not much, but it's something.

07:45.006 --> 07:46.587
They're doing major renovations.

07:46.675 --> 07:49.917
You get the job,
hardly anybody will be there.

07:51.429 --> 07:53.215
Not quite as exciting
as where you've been.

08:01.940 --> 08:05.899
You know, when we fought in Vietnam,
we saw a lot of things.

08:07.779 --> 08:11.146
After the war, the only people who really
understood what we went through...

08:12.283 --> 08:13.693
Were the other soldiers.

08:15.078 --> 08:16.909
There's groups you can talk to.

08:21.918 --> 08:23.749
Don't worry. I'm fine.

08:25.130 --> 08:26.620
I'll check out this job.

08:31.344 --> 08:32.833
I missed you, uncle pat.

10:04.312 --> 10:06.348
I owe you a couple of mets tickets.

10:06.439 --> 10:08.430
Not until they got a team worth watching.

10:09.734 --> 10:12.191
Hey, so where do I find borz blasevic?

10:12.278 --> 10:15.111
In the locker room.
Take the elevator down to the basement,

10:15.198 --> 10:17.109
go left through the fire doors.
You'll see it.

10:17.200 --> 10:18.781
And don't tell him we're related.

10:18.868 --> 10:21.826
- He'll go easier on you.
- All right.

10:25.917 --> 10:26.997
Hey, uncle pat.

10:28.002 --> 10:29.002
Thanks.

10:39.013 --> 10:40.799
- You're gorski?
- Yes, sir.

10:40.890 --> 10:42.050
Pat told me you were coming.

10:43.268 --> 10:44.508
He's a nice guy.

10:46.229 --> 10:48.094
- Don't you think?
- Yes, sir.

10:48.189 --> 10:49.975
You can put your stuff...

10:51.442 --> 10:52.477
Here.

10:53.611 --> 10:55.317
Sorry about this.
We're all unisex here.

11:00.535 --> 11:02.901
This is what I love about rachmaninoff.

11:04.664 --> 11:06.450
He's so unexpected.

11:06.541 --> 11:08.452
I feel the same way about Dylan.

11:08.543 --> 11:10.659
- Thomas?
- Bob.

11:12.088 --> 11:14.670
You're not a fan
of classical work, are you?

11:14.757 --> 11:16.167
Not exactly, sir.

11:17.886 --> 11:19.376
You can cut the "sir" crap.

11:20.513 --> 11:22.158
We have enough kissing up
to do here already.

11:22.182 --> 11:23.662
We don't have to do it to each other.

11:25.101 --> 11:27.808
We'll use the next two days
to get you acclimated.

11:27.896 --> 11:29.761
You get the easter weekend off.

11:29.856 --> 11:32.168
Everyone will be out of the building,
so you won't miss much.

11:32.192 --> 11:34.683
You come back to work on Monday.

11:34.777 --> 11:38.395
There will be more babysitting
the carrington while it gets a facelift.

11:38.489 --> 11:40.855
Think you can handle that?

11:40.950 --> 11:42.030
I'll do my best, sir.

11:43.036 --> 11:44.036
Good.

11:48.666 --> 11:50.577
- Let's go, let's go!
- Holiday!

11:52.545 --> 11:54.957
Hey!

11:55.048 --> 11:57.915
I may be old-fashioned,
but a woman doorman?

11:58.009 --> 12:01.046
We're trying to modernize our image
at the carrington, sir. I'm sorry.

12:06.476 --> 12:08.137
Here, let me help you with those.

12:08.228 --> 12:10.594
- Oh, no. I got them.
- I insist, I insist.

12:10.688 --> 12:12.519
Thank you.

12:12.607 --> 12:14.472
You're not moving
during the remodeling?

12:14.567 --> 12:18.685
Borz was kind enough
to arrange an exception for us.

12:18.780 --> 12:21.692
Poor Bernard had a stroke
seven years ago.

12:22.909 --> 12:25.946
You know how old fogies
feel about change.

12:26.037 --> 12:28.028
Old fogies. Come on, you're not that old.

12:28.122 --> 12:31.364
You're kind.

12:31.459 --> 12:34.667
A liar, but kind nevertheless.

12:38.758 --> 12:41.500
Oh, that was very helpful, dear.

12:43.888 --> 12:46.971
You know, your sister never stopped
talking about you.

12:48.059 --> 12:49.640
- Now I know why.
- Wait.

12:50.645 --> 12:52.476
How do you know my sister?

12:52.563 --> 12:54.724
Well, you're Ali, right?

12:54.816 --> 12:57.102
Your sister and family
lived in the building.

12:57.193 --> 12:59.184
Her husband and kids still do.

13:00.488 --> 13:01.694
Where is he?

13:02.699 --> 13:03.699
10c.

13:04.534 --> 13:08.197
Oh, lovely family,
but tragic what they've lived through.

13:10.915 --> 13:13.031
Have a happy easter.

13:21.843 --> 13:23.424
Why didn't you tell me?

13:24.846 --> 13:26.427
Well, I was gonna...

13:26.514 --> 13:28.971
You know, I thought being
close to family might...

13:31.561 --> 13:33.722
Might be, you know...

13:35.857 --> 13:37.142
Nice.

13:39.277 --> 13:41.893
- Max, get the door.
- I'm busy.

13:41.988 --> 13:45.196
Max, I swear to god,
I'm gonna throw that game out the window.

13:48.286 --> 13:50.993
- What?
- Is your father home by any chance?

13:51.080 --> 13:52.080
It's for you.

13:53.583 --> 13:55.323
Well, who is it? I'm working.

14:01.758 --> 14:05.091
- Ali.
- What the hell is going on?

14:05.178 --> 14:07.419
- You tell me. Are you working here?
- Yeah.

14:07.513 --> 14:09.424
And that has nothing to do with you?

14:10.850 --> 14:12.010
No.

14:12.101 --> 14:13.762
Damn it, uncle pat.

14:16.356 --> 14:17.971
- You want to come in?
- No.

14:19.275 --> 14:20.981
I did not ask for this.

14:21.069 --> 14:23.685
Believe me, I had no idea
you were gonna end up here.

14:25.073 --> 14:26.438
- Jasper!
- No.

14:26.532 --> 14:28.818
Jasper! Damn it.

14:28.910 --> 14:31.242
Lily, how many times? Words.

14:32.246 --> 14:34.703
We have to find him.

14:35.958 --> 14:37.869
Uh, look, I've got to get this.

14:37.960 --> 14:40.918
It's my publisher in London.
We've been missing each other all morning.

14:41.005 --> 14:43.621
Can you just... I won't be long.

14:46.677 --> 14:48.759
Do you need help?

14:48.846 --> 14:52.555
Jasper could be anywhere by now.
We need Max.

14:52.642 --> 14:54.348
- Come on!
- Oh! Okay.

14:56.354 --> 14:58.015
Max!

14:59.774 --> 15:00.934
Go away.

15:02.860 --> 15:04.691
Lily, what the hell?

15:04.779 --> 15:06.644
Jasper escaped again.
We need your help.

15:06.739 --> 15:08.024
(Get out!

15:09.492 --> 15:11.574
I don't have time to look
for your stupid cat.

15:13.121 --> 15:16.454
If you don't help us, I'll tell dad
that you're smoking marijuana again.

15:19.335 --> 15:20.791
Jasper!

15:21.963 --> 15:23.703
Jasper, come here.

15:23.798 --> 15:25.709
There's 63 apartments on ten floors,

15:25.800 --> 15:27.882
all of them open for the contractor.

15:28.886 --> 15:30.968
This is gonna take forever.

15:31.055 --> 15:33.117
Max collected all of the blueprints
for the carrington

15:33.141 --> 15:35.928
- when he was a boy scout.
- Max, a boy scout?

15:37.228 --> 15:38.434
I can see that.

15:39.439 --> 15:40.439
Jasper?

15:43.985 --> 15:44.985
Jasper?

15:45.820 --> 15:47.356
Jasper!

15:47.447 --> 15:48.653
Where are you?

15:52.160 --> 15:53.366
Where'd your brother go?

15:54.370 --> 15:57.703
Max? Max, this isn't funny.

15:57.790 --> 15:59.655
Max, where'd you go?

16:00.793 --> 16:01.999
- Max...
- Ahh!

16:04.046 --> 16:05.411
Butt brain!

16:05.506 --> 16:07.246
Where did you even
come from anyway?

16:07.341 --> 16:10.128
A secret door.
Building's full of them.

16:10.219 --> 16:12.460
Servants used them
to get from room to room.

16:12.555 --> 16:13.555
Huh.

16:15.433 --> 16:16.843
Jasper!

16:18.144 --> 16:20.510
- What's your name anyhow?
- Ali.

16:21.522 --> 16:23.183
Aunt Ali?

16:23.274 --> 16:24.889
Mommy told us all about you.

16:26.194 --> 16:28.651
- She did?
- Yeah, you were her hero.

16:30.031 --> 16:31.646
So how do we find Jasper anyway?

16:31.741 --> 16:32.947
Jasper...

16:33.034 --> 16:34.365
I et's check the basement.

16:40.291 --> 16:42.782
That's Jasper.

16:44.629 --> 16:46.494
What's through this wall?

16:46.589 --> 16:49.922
They were building a subway tunnel
under the carrington.

16:50.009 --> 16:52.751
Ran out of money in the '40s,
sealed it up.

16:54.639 --> 16:55.674
Jasper.

16:57.642 --> 16:58.927
Jasper!

17:01.312 --> 17:03.018
Please be okay.

17:03.105 --> 17:04.470
Max, give me your phone.

17:10.488 --> 17:11.897
There he is.

17:11.989 --> 17:14.570
- What do we do?
- Now, let's see.

17:24.460 --> 17:25.950
What's she doing?

17:26.045 --> 17:27.626
Do not try this at home.

17:36.681 --> 17:38.967
I didn't think
we'd ever see Jasper again,

17:39.058 --> 17:43.427
but then aunt Ali dropped into the hole
like spider-man and saved him.

17:44.855 --> 17:46.140
- Really?
- Yep.

17:46.232 --> 17:48.848
Your aunt was always full of surprises.

17:48.943 --> 17:51.355
Right. You, go in and get
started on mommy's mint sauce,

17:51.445 --> 17:52.981
and I'll join you in a minute.

17:53.072 --> 17:55.905
Will you come to easter dinner tomorrow?
I'm cooking it.

17:57.201 --> 17:58.737
Lily, I would love that but...

17:58.828 --> 18:00.364
You got to eat.

18:03.124 --> 18:05.490
It'll give us a chance to reconnect.

18:06.502 --> 18:08.788
I don't want to reconnect.

18:10.881 --> 18:13.122
I'm taking the kids
back to the uk on Monday.

18:13.217 --> 18:16.880
During the construction, you'll have
the place to yourself without us.

18:16.971 --> 18:20.555
The only reason we stayed so long was Lily
wanted to make an easter dinner here.

18:21.559 --> 18:23.140
Like her mother did.

18:24.979 --> 18:27.061
I know.

18:27.148 --> 18:29.514
We weren't really in touch, and I...

18:30.526 --> 18:31.936
I didn't know what to say.

18:32.028 --> 18:33.643
Please, Ali?

19:06.103 --> 19:07.434
You're still here, buddy?

19:09.523 --> 19:11.980
Your shift ended over an hour ago.

19:12.068 --> 19:14.400
Don't you have an easter feast
waiting for you somewhere?

19:14.487 --> 19:18.275
I promised Mrs. hersch
I'd fix her microwave before I went home.

19:19.283 --> 19:20.944
That's thoughtful of you.

19:21.035 --> 19:23.401
Yeah, well, I don't want
to disappoint her.

19:23.496 --> 19:25.077
Do you wanna share a beer?

19:26.415 --> 19:29.031
- Start the celebration.
- Yeah, sure.

19:33.631 --> 19:34.871
Hey, hey, tilt the glass.

19:34.965 --> 19:37.172
You never poured a beer before?

19:37.259 --> 19:38.590
Like this?

19:38.678 --> 19:40.088
- Is that better?
- Yeah.

19:40.179 --> 19:41.669
A better tilt?

19:41.764 --> 19:43.470
So what's your plans tonight?

19:43.557 --> 19:45.513
At home. TV, bed.

19:45.601 --> 19:47.387
- No party?
- No party.

19:47.478 --> 19:49.810
Okay. Here's some beer, at least.

20:28.018 --> 20:30.009
- You're back already.
- I am.

20:30.104 --> 20:31.844
I told you to take the holiday off.

20:31.939 --> 20:34.100
The Stantons invited me for dinner.

20:34.191 --> 20:36.773
- You work fast.
- Sheer force of my personality maybe.

20:36.861 --> 20:38.271
You're staying in?

20:38.362 --> 20:40.148
Yeah. Home-cooked meal.

20:40.239 --> 20:43.652
Trust me, I would welcome any chance
to duck out, but I promised, so...

20:44.744 --> 20:46.530
Okay.

20:46.620 --> 20:48.952
You want me to save you some pie?
It's fresh from the deli.

20:49.039 --> 20:50.870
No, it's okay. I'm on a diet.

20:52.626 --> 20:53.911
Your loss.

20:55.546 --> 20:56.786
Have fun.

21:52.269 --> 21:53.725
Shall we begin?

22:06.700 --> 22:08.315
Jammer's set. Good to go.

22:12.706 --> 22:16.699
Cut it. Cut it. Cut the blue one.

22:16.794 --> 22:19.627
Let me handle it. I got it, I got it.

22:19.713 --> 22:21.374
Please. Thank you.

22:24.009 --> 22:25.374
Woah!

22:27.721 --> 22:29.757
Whoo! Rock and roll.

22:36.188 --> 22:38.099
- What's this?
- Something I made for you.

22:39.525 --> 22:40.685
Wait, Lily, this is amazing.

22:40.776 --> 22:43.438
How did you draw this?
It looks exactly like me.

22:43.529 --> 22:45.485
I used a picture of you and daddy.

22:49.368 --> 22:50.778
Where'd you find this?

22:50.870 --> 22:53.236
In daddy's memory book.
Don't you like it?

22:54.415 --> 22:57.532
Yeah. No, I love it. It's amazing.
Thank you so much.

22:57.626 --> 23:01.084
I am gonna put it right up here
so that everyone can enjoy it.

23:01.171 --> 23:02.331
Do you think they'll like it?

23:04.174 --> 23:06.415
Of course.

23:09.305 --> 23:12.342
Speaking of everyone,
where is your father?

23:12.433 --> 23:14.640
- He's busy.
- He's always busy.

23:18.898 --> 23:20.889
Your mommy told me a story.

23:20.983 --> 23:22.689
Do you know what water wings are?

23:23.861 --> 23:26.193
Daddy made me wear them
when I learned to swim.

23:26.280 --> 23:27.736
It's so frustrating.

23:29.366 --> 23:31.823
Can you imagine wearing them
every single day?

23:31.911 --> 23:34.402
I wouldn't cope. I'd die.

23:34.496 --> 23:37.533
What if I told you that your daddy
used to wear them

23:37.625 --> 23:39.957
every single time he left the house?

23:40.044 --> 23:41.955
- You're kidding.
- It's true.

23:42.046 --> 23:45.379
Your grandma lived in a house
with a really big lake,

23:45.466 --> 23:49.425
so every time your daddy wanted to go out
and play, she made him wear them.

23:50.596 --> 23:52.086
You're kidding!

23:52.181 --> 23:56.094
So, every time you get a little
mad at your dad, just remember...

23:56.185 --> 23:58.847
- Water wings.
- Water wings.

23:58.938 --> 24:00.018
Mm-hmm.

24:00.105 --> 24:02.596
Sorry, I had a deadline.

24:02.691 --> 24:04.682
Finally got the publisher off my back.

24:06.320 --> 24:07.400
Okay.

24:08.739 --> 24:10.070
What are you doing?

24:11.075 --> 24:12.075
Shh.

24:12.117 --> 24:13.232
Help your sister.

24:19.249 --> 24:20.284
Did I miss something?

24:20.376 --> 24:22.332
What? No. Miss something? Here?

24:22.419 --> 24:24.205
- Nothing at all.
- There's nothing to miss.

24:24.296 --> 24:26.753
- Just talking about vegetables.
- Love vegetables.

24:26.840 --> 24:27.840
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

24:28.926 --> 24:30.166
All right.

24:35.432 --> 24:37.844
That must be pat to fix the microwave.

24:41.105 --> 24:42.515
Oh, borz!

24:42.606 --> 24:44.562
- Happy easter.
- Happy easter.

24:44.650 --> 24:46.015
What can I do for you?

24:46.110 --> 24:48.317
- You have a visitor.
- I wasn't expecting one.

24:48.404 --> 24:50.269
It's an old friend of your husband.

24:50.364 --> 24:52.571
A friend of Bernard's?

24:52.658 --> 24:53.658
Good evening.

24:53.742 --> 24:55.607
- Oh!
- My name is Victor Dubois.

24:55.703 --> 25:00.288
I happen to be in town briefly
for the holiday and wanted to stop by.

25:00.374 --> 25:02.786
I hope this is not too much
of an inconvenience.

25:02.876 --> 25:04.958
Oh, of course not!

25:05.045 --> 25:06.876
Oh, come in, come in.

25:06.964 --> 25:09.376
Can I get you anything? Some tea?

25:09.466 --> 25:12.833
- We have plenty of food.
- Some tea would be delightful.

25:15.764 --> 25:16.764
My old friend.

25:17.766 --> 25:20.553
Bernard hardly says a word
since the stroke.

25:20.644 --> 25:23.681
The doctors say it triggered
akinetic mutism.

25:24.982 --> 25:26.893
Now Mr. Dubois,

25:26.984 --> 25:29.817
how do you know my husband?

25:29.903 --> 25:32.690
We worked together in Berlin
over 30 years ago.

25:34.116 --> 25:36.903
My Bernard?

25:36.994 --> 25:38.859
Oh, no, that's not possible.

25:38.954 --> 25:42.037
He went by the name
of erich dreischler then.

25:42.124 --> 25:45.958
- I'm afraid you have the wrong person.
- I'm afraid not.

25:46.962 --> 25:48.202
Erich.

25:54.386 --> 25:57.128
Mr. Dubois, my husband
doesn't speak French.

25:57.222 --> 26:00.931
- He's never even been to Europe.
- Erich?

26:04.104 --> 26:06.140
Borz? What is this about?

26:06.231 --> 26:09.143
Sit down. Sit down.

26:11.111 --> 26:13.872
It seems there's a lot you don't know
about your husband, Mrs. hersch.

26:16.742 --> 26:20.701
I can't wait until dinner.
I'm starving.

26:22.664 --> 26:24.996
So, what was it like over there?

26:26.293 --> 26:28.875
It was... it was great.

26:28.962 --> 26:30.247
Did you kill anyone?

26:30.339 --> 26:33.706
Max, don't be an imbecile.
That's totally out of line.

26:35.844 --> 26:38.881
No, it's... it's fine.

26:38.972 --> 26:40.837
Yeah. Yes, I did.

26:42.059 --> 26:43.059
Cool.

26:44.019 --> 26:45.179
More wine?

26:46.563 --> 26:48.349
Yeah. Yeah, of course.

26:48.440 --> 26:49.771
Just open another bottle.

26:52.194 --> 26:56.028
I just wish everything could go back
to the way it was before mommy died.

26:57.783 --> 27:01.071
So, uh, how long do these go in for?

27:01.161 --> 27:03.152
About 50 minutes.

27:03.247 --> 27:06.239
They'll be... fine when you take them out.

27:08.085 --> 27:10.497
Dreischler, I know everything.

27:20.931 --> 27:24.094
I told you, we don't know anything.

27:24.184 --> 27:25.184
Would you like some help?

27:27.604 --> 27:28.604
Not yet.

27:29.439 --> 27:30.519
Erich.

27:40.117 --> 27:41.357
What about now?

27:43.203 --> 27:44.488
Refresh his memory.

27:55.174 --> 27:56.414
He's a tough old guy.

27:56.508 --> 27:57.998
He's had a stroke.

27:58.093 --> 27:59.958
- Sit down. Sit down!
- He can't feel a thing

28:00.053 --> 28:01.793
on that side of his body.

28:04.224 --> 28:05.714
Try the other side.

28:10.981 --> 28:12.141
That's better.

28:15.777 --> 28:16.892
Dubois.

28:17.905 --> 28:20.237
Welcome back, herr dreischler.

28:26.079 --> 28:27.785
In the wall.

28:27.873 --> 28:29.454
Which wall? Point to it.

28:34.796 --> 28:35.796
Here.

28:39.635 --> 28:41.125
Oh, no, no, no.

28:42.429 --> 28:43.669
Here.

28:46.975 --> 28:48.385
I don't know.

28:51.355 --> 28:52.595
Please!

28:52.689 --> 28:54.429
Gentlemen, you can enter.

28:54.524 --> 28:56.310
I don't know!

28:56.401 --> 28:57.401
Copy that.

29:05.118 --> 29:06.278
So it's in the walls.

29:07.663 --> 29:09.779
Let's get started.

29:12.376 --> 29:13.832
What does this bring to mind?

29:13.919 --> 29:15.375
Wagner.

29:15.462 --> 29:17.327
- Duvall.
- Apocalypse now.

29:19.883 --> 29:22.215
I love the smell of napalm in the morning.

29:37.442 --> 29:38.442
Nice view.

29:38.527 --> 29:40.358
Yeah, it was a big selling point.

29:40.445 --> 29:41.485
The sauce tastes really...

29:43.115 --> 29:44.446
The mint sauce.

29:44.533 --> 29:47.275
It's all right, it's all right.
We'll make do without. It's okay.

29:47.369 --> 29:48.734
That was mommy's favorite.

29:48.829 --> 29:51.115
We can't have easter dinner
without the mint sauce.

29:51.206 --> 29:52.821
That was mommy's favorite.

29:52.916 --> 29:54.952
- We can't, we just can't.
- It's okay.

29:59.256 --> 30:01.167
Max, are you stoned?

30:02.175 --> 30:04.666
You get sloshed. I get stoned.

30:04.761 --> 30:06.171
What's the big deal?

30:07.472 --> 30:09.463
One's legal, one isn't. Go to your room.

30:11.977 --> 30:13.717
Wait, so...

30:13.812 --> 30:16.178
She spills mint sauce on me,

30:16.273 --> 30:18.889
and I'm the one who's sent to my room?

30:18.984 --> 30:21.304
When mom was here,
she never would've dealt with this shit.

30:21.361 --> 30:24.215
Mom isn't here. I'm here, and you're
just gonna have to get used to that.

30:24.239 --> 30:26.446
Yeah. Of course mom's not here.

30:26.533 --> 30:30.742
- Thanks to you.
- Max, go to your room now.

30:32.372 --> 30:34.784
Why couldn't you have been
the one who died?

30:39.004 --> 30:40.494
Fuck this shit.

30:44.384 --> 30:46.170
I'm sorry you had to witness that.

30:47.387 --> 30:49.548
I've seen worse.

30:52.684 --> 30:55.175
Lily, the hersches are still here,

30:55.270 --> 30:57.761
and I bet they have loads
of spare mint sauce.

30:58.774 --> 31:00.184
What do you say, huh?

31:01.485 --> 31:03.646
But it won't have pine nuts.

31:03.737 --> 31:05.819
I bet you I can find those too.

31:09.618 --> 31:11.734
Hey, Ali, can you just wait a moment?

31:11.828 --> 31:13.739
- Sure.
- Sweetheart,

31:13.830 --> 31:16.367
why don't you get a sponge
and a towel from the kitchen?

31:16.458 --> 31:17.823
I'll help you clean up.

31:23.298 --> 31:24.458
Damn it!

31:25.509 --> 31:26.624
It's empty.

31:29.888 --> 31:31.048
Nol

31:31.139 --> 31:32.845
where are they?

31:32.933 --> 31:35.390
We don't know what you're looking for.

31:35.477 --> 31:39.390
Please, we've lived in this apartment
for seven years,

31:39.481 --> 31:42.393
and if there was something here,
I would know about it.

31:45.404 --> 31:50.114
My records indicate that you lived
at the carrington for close to 30.

31:52.828 --> 31:56.241
When Bernard had his stroke,
we wanted something on the ground floor,

31:56.331 --> 31:58.037
so we moved down here.

31:59.042 --> 32:00.998
There you have it.

32:01.086 --> 32:04.795
And which apartment
did you used to live in?

32:06.091 --> 32:08.332
- 10c.
- 10c.

32:09.344 --> 32:12.211
Thank you, Mrs. hersch,
for your cooperation.

32:12.305 --> 32:14.045
10c is occupied.

32:14.141 --> 32:17.599
- Occupied?
- They delayed their move until Monday.

32:17.686 --> 32:19.426
He's a professor with two kids.

32:19.521 --> 32:23.184
You informed me the building would be
empty except for the hersches.

32:23.275 --> 32:24.890
It's ten floors up.

32:24.985 --> 32:26.850
- I didn't think that...
- That's right.

32:26.945 --> 32:31.063
You didn't think. Well, do so now.

32:31.158 --> 32:33.023
Figure out what to do with them.

32:37.372 --> 32:39.203
- Let's go.
- Pack it up.

32:40.250 --> 32:41.456
I got these.

32:46.631 --> 32:52.342
Even that hoodlum sees you
for the vain brute you are.

32:56.725 --> 32:58.181
So now you talk?

33:02.564 --> 33:05.556
I can't tell you what it means
to the kids for you to be here.

33:06.985 --> 33:10.318
They have a unique way
of showing it, don't they?

33:10.405 --> 33:11.986
Well, you should see them on a bad day.

33:17.787 --> 33:19.243
I'm sorry, Ali.

33:21.750 --> 33:25.663
I mean, I feel blessed with my kids
and the time I had with Kate.

33:27.380 --> 33:29.166
But your sister wasn't the easiest person.

33:29.257 --> 33:30.838
Yeah, you married her.

33:32.177 --> 33:33.417
Yeah, you're right.

33:35.013 --> 33:37.658
We went through a rough patch.
I turned to you. I was wrong to do so.

33:37.682 --> 33:39.619
- Please, can we not...
- No, I thought about this for years.

33:39.643 --> 33:40.723
Just hear me out.

33:44.231 --> 33:46.062
You saw me as the man I wanted to be.

33:46.149 --> 33:49.562
You made me feel...
You made me feel.

33:49.653 --> 33:52.298
And then I wake up one morning, and you've
gone. What am I supposed to think?

33:52.322 --> 33:53.983
I went off to serve my country.

33:54.074 --> 33:57.566
Oh, come on. That's an absurd
rationalization if ever I've heard one.

33:59.246 --> 34:01.988
I understand. You're in pain.

34:02.082 --> 34:05.666
But I was never gonna be the person
to ruin my sister's marriage.

34:05.752 --> 34:07.083
How do you think I felt?

34:07.170 --> 34:10.081
What, so you sign up
as a lifer in the marines?

34:11.299 --> 34:12.708
It's almost a clichÃ©.

34:13.717 --> 34:15.208
What do you want from me?

34:17.556 --> 34:19.137
Ali, I never meant to hurt you.

34:20.559 --> 34:23.141
To be honest, I don't really care anymore.

34:26.356 --> 34:27.641
But I do.

34:30.860 --> 34:34.068
I am going to get Lily
some mint sauce now.

34:53.007 --> 34:55.248
Mrs. hersch? Mrs. hersch?

35:00.682 --> 35:01.922
Oh, my god.

35:04.728 --> 35:05.934
Oh, my god.

35:14.070 --> 35:15.185
Borz.

35:16.197 --> 35:17.607
Borz, are you there?

35:19.409 --> 35:20.569
Hello?

35:20.660 --> 35:22.305
Borz, call the police.
The hersches are dead.

35:22.329 --> 35:23.444
I cannot hear you.

35:23.538 --> 35:25.074
Can you please come to the lobby?

35:26.082 --> 35:27.117
Hello?

35:27.208 --> 35:28.208
Shit.

35:32.547 --> 35:34.083
Ali?

35:34.174 --> 35:36.005
Ali, did you get it?

35:36.092 --> 35:37.582
Hello, young lady.

35:40.138 --> 35:41.423
- Daddy.
- Hey, what's going on?

35:43.224 --> 35:44.304
Hey, who are you?

35:44.392 --> 35:47.555
Good evening.
My name is Victor Dubois.

35:47.646 --> 35:50.262
Sorry for the unannounced arrival.

35:51.816 --> 35:56.230
I promise our visit will be as brief
as humanly possible.

35:58.865 --> 36:01.072
We do what they say
and everything will be fine.

36:01.159 --> 36:03.616
- What if it isn't fine?
- Shh...

36:05.747 --> 36:07.703
Borz, what's going on?
I just tried to call you.

36:07.791 --> 36:10.498
The intercom is not working.
The phones are down. I don't know.

36:10.585 --> 36:12.291
The hersches are dead.

36:12.379 --> 36:13.915
- What?
- Call the police.

36:31.815 --> 36:32.815
Fuck.

36:44.744 --> 36:47.235
Come on, come on. Come on.

36:49.624 --> 36:52.331
- This is a big place.
- Yeah, this may take a while.

36:52.419 --> 36:54.535
- Get the tools out.
- I got these.

36:54.629 --> 36:55.709
Let's go. Let's get moving.

36:55.797 --> 36:57.708
No need to hide your phone.

36:57.799 --> 36:59.664
You'll find there is no service.

37:01.386 --> 37:03.377
Quite the collection you have here.

37:04.514 --> 37:07.051
A fan of European history, are you?

37:08.059 --> 37:09.344
I teach it at Columbia.

37:09.436 --> 37:12.052
Oh. A professor.

37:13.815 --> 37:14.895
Goya.

37:14.983 --> 37:17.065
One of los caprichos.

37:17.152 --> 37:19.359
Very good taste, Mr. Stanton.

37:19.446 --> 37:20.936
You know your art.

37:21.030 --> 37:24.864
I admire how an artist
can dip his brush into his soul

37:24.951 --> 37:27.613
and capture his times in paintings.

37:27.704 --> 37:31.492
It appears goya captured
our times as well.

37:31.583 --> 37:35.451
The picture's called the sleep of reason
produces monsters.

37:36.546 --> 37:37.546
Hi, guys.

37:39.674 --> 37:40.674
- Hi, Jon.
- Borz.

37:40.759 --> 37:43.296
- What is this about?
- It'll be fine.

37:43.386 --> 37:46.549
Pee-wee, there's a girl trapped
in the elevator on the eighth floor.

37:46.639 --> 37:47.924
He's talking about Ali.

37:48.016 --> 37:49.677
Can you go take care of it?

37:52.061 --> 37:53.972
Everything okay?

37:54.063 --> 37:55.928
- Everything's super.
- Ah.

37:56.024 --> 37:58.106
Hi, Lily. Happy easter.

37:59.110 --> 38:00.441
Hi, borz.

38:11.372 --> 38:12.908
Where's Max?

38:12.999 --> 38:15.490
He's with his aunt for easter
in the Hamptons.

38:18.338 --> 38:19.418
Max?

38:20.799 --> 38:25.168
I find it interesting that you set up
a place for him here at your table.

38:26.179 --> 38:27.294
Go find him.

38:54.999 --> 38:57.206
Hey, buddy.

39:21.150 --> 39:24.062
- We can start the work, Martinez.
- Copy.

39:24.153 --> 39:27.520
Okay, let's start here, here and here.

40:15.246 --> 40:16.611
Hey, sweet thing.

40:44.901 --> 40:47.187
I smell you.

40:48.196 --> 40:49.481
Oh, yeah.

41:07.256 --> 41:09.212
Who are you and what do you want?

41:26.734 --> 41:28.144
Where are you?

41:51.884 --> 41:53.875
You're a twisted bitch, ain't you?

41:55.096 --> 41:56.506
You're not a Virgo, are you?

41:57.557 --> 42:01.175
I dated one of those.
Always had to choose the movies.

42:01.269 --> 42:02.679
It was a disaster.

42:03.980 --> 42:05.220
I'm a gemini.

42:06.691 --> 42:07.851
What are you?

42:24.709 --> 42:26.700
I'm a scorpio. It would never work.

42:32.884 --> 42:34.215
Pee-wee?

42:34.385 --> 42:35.420
Pee-\wee?

42:36.846 --> 42:37.961
Please, just stop.

42:38.056 --> 42:39.717
Nothing in this wall.

42:39.807 --> 42:42.244
Tell me what you want. I'll give you
anything, just leave us alone.

42:42.268 --> 42:45.180
I appreciate your kind offer,
but in this instance,

42:45.271 --> 42:47.637
I don't believe
you can be of assistance.

42:47.732 --> 42:49.597
Pee-wee, come in.

42:49.692 --> 42:51.808
- What's going on?
- Pee-wee's not answering.

42:51.903 --> 42:53.234
Take Leo and check it out.

42:53.321 --> 42:56.939
Perhaps it is just a problem
with pee-wee's radio.

42:57.033 --> 42:59.153
As you taught me,
it's better to cover every scenario.

43:00.244 --> 43:03.182
And when you're down in the lobby, turn
the elevators on so we can use them.

43:03.206 --> 43:04.867
And what scenario am I missing?

43:08.211 --> 43:10.372
There's a doorman in the building.

43:12.507 --> 43:13.667
It's just a girl.

43:14.759 --> 43:16.670
It's nothing to worry about.

43:16.761 --> 43:17.921
Max, what happened?

43:19.597 --> 43:22.714
Sweetie, I am sorry that you had
to see that, but I need you to focus.

43:22.809 --> 43:24.390
Tell me everything that you know.

43:25.603 --> 43:26.718
Max.

43:29.649 --> 43:30.764
You killed him.

43:32.860 --> 43:34.646
Listen, the only thing
that matters right now

43:34.737 --> 43:37.820
is where he came from
and how we can stop them.

43:37.907 --> 43:40.569
A bunch of guys with guns
broke into our apartment.

43:40.660 --> 43:42.525
They've got my dad and sister.

43:43.746 --> 43:45.077
Okay. How many guys?

43:45.164 --> 43:47.450
I don't know. Four, maybe five.

43:48.459 --> 43:49.619
Borz is with them.

43:49.710 --> 43:51.826
- I figured.
- And some French dude.

43:51.921 --> 43:54.082
I think he might be their leader.

43:56.092 --> 43:57.548
This is so twisted.

43:59.679 --> 44:01.419
Focus, Max.

44:01.514 --> 44:04.847
You know your way around this building.
I don't. I need you.

44:04.934 --> 44:07.050
Your family needs you.

44:08.312 --> 44:10.303
What would they want
in your apartment anyway?

44:10.398 --> 44:14.311
I'm telling you, man,
this shit is messed up.

44:14.402 --> 44:16.768
Did you see borz
cutting that old man's leg?

44:17.780 --> 44:20.817
He was enjoying that shit. You saw it.

44:22.869 --> 44:24.860
I don't know, man.

44:24.954 --> 44:26.785
I don't know if this job is worth it.

44:27.790 --> 44:31.078
Hey, how much you getting paid anyway?
Twenty-five?

44:32.461 --> 44:33.621
What, thirty?

44:46.809 --> 44:47.809
Borz, come in.

44:48.811 --> 44:49.846
Yeah, copy.

44:50.855 --> 44:53.312
We found pee-wee. He's dead.

44:56.068 --> 44:58.650
This is how you have things under control?

45:02.491 --> 45:04.732
- Find her and kill her.
- Copy.

45:08.539 --> 45:10.450
- Go, go, go.
- What was that?

45:10.541 --> 45:11.872
Go, go.

45:14.795 --> 45:16.126
I see 'em! Get 'em!

45:27.975 --> 45:29.135
Max?

45:30.686 --> 45:33.428
There's a room behind
one of these walls.

45:33.522 --> 45:36.434
Pat told me.
He called it a hidden sanctuary.

45:49.789 --> 45:51.199
I got it. I got it.

46:08.224 --> 46:10.556
Not exactly the sanctuary
I was expecting.

46:13.813 --> 46:16.054
Borz? Borz, come in.

46:16.148 --> 46:17.763
- Copy.
- I got 'em.

46:20.152 --> 46:21.152
We lost them.

46:21.237 --> 46:24.104
You lost them? Who's "them"?

46:24.198 --> 46:26.280
- She's got a kid with her.
- T's Max.

46:27.285 --> 46:28.491
She's armed.

46:32.206 --> 46:33.321
Keep looking.

46:38.421 --> 46:41.333
- You know morse?
- I was a scout once.

46:45.344 --> 46:48.507
- So what is this place?
- It's a speakeasy.

46:48.597 --> 46:51.589
During prohibition, residents
would meet here in secret to get wasted.

46:53.144 --> 46:55.135
Not on my watch. Come on.
What are you doing?

46:55.229 --> 46:58.016
- You're not my mom.
- Exactly. Sit down.

46:58.107 --> 47:00.473
How'd she get into the building?

47:01.610 --> 47:03.726
- I let her in.
- Really?

47:03.821 --> 47:06.049
Yeah, she was having dinner here
with the Stantons, and I...

47:06.073 --> 47:07.529
Thought she was on the tenth floor?

47:07.616 --> 47:09.698
- Yeah.
- You idiot.

47:13.664 --> 47:16.326
So, she was having dinner here?

47:16.417 --> 47:19.955
What light can you shed
on our mysterious lady?

47:22.298 --> 47:24.710
Nothing. I just met her.

47:25.885 --> 47:28.877
You invited a stranger
to share easter dinner?

47:29.889 --> 47:31.470
She must be very beautiful.

47:32.725 --> 47:35.091
She helped my children
save Jasper, our cat.

47:35.186 --> 47:37.177
She's new here.
It was the least we could do.

47:38.230 --> 47:40.061
Who is this doorwoman?

47:42.109 --> 47:43.109
You have a name?

47:44.111 --> 47:45.111
Ali.

47:45.196 --> 47:46.402
Ali what?

47:47.490 --> 47:49.947
Her full name... something Polish.

47:50.951 --> 47:52.111
Gorski.

47:57.333 --> 47:59.574
- Oh.
- What?

47:59.668 --> 48:05.129
"Gunnery sergeant Alexandra gorski
of the marine security guard brigade

48:05.216 --> 48:11.257
received a silver star for her actions
on October 15, 2019

48:11.347 --> 48:14.839
during a terrorist ambush
on the ambassador's convoy

48:14.934 --> 48:17.220
in Bucharest, Romania.

48:17.311 --> 48:19.643
Gorski is only the third female soldier

48:19.730 --> 48:24.770
to receive the award for exceptional valor
since world war ii."

48:24.860 --> 48:28.694
What's a decorated soldier
doing here as a doorman?

48:29.824 --> 48:31.439
Why didn't you talk to my mom?

48:32.785 --> 48:34.821
That's a long story.

48:36.455 --> 48:39.413
What about my dad?
You guys clearly knew each other.

48:40.543 --> 48:41.828
He was kind of an ass.

48:42.837 --> 48:44.418
Yeah, still is.

48:44.505 --> 48:47.087
I didn't mean that. He is a good man.

48:47.174 --> 48:48.880
My dad's a pussy.

48:48.968 --> 48:50.208
No, he's not.

48:51.929 --> 48:53.715
You don't know anything about him.

48:53.806 --> 48:57.094
A dad raising two kids
on his own is not a coward.

48:59.311 --> 49:01.723
My mom and dad were driving back
from the theater.

49:03.774 --> 49:04.960
I was on the phone with my mom

49:04.984 --> 49:07.350
when the car slid off the road
into the lake.

49:08.529 --> 49:10.269
My mom was trapped inside.

49:13.951 --> 49:15.316
Dad made it out.

49:16.328 --> 49:17.328
She didn't.

49:19.623 --> 49:21.739
I'm sure that he tried
everything that he could.

49:21.834 --> 49:25.873
I was on the phone with her for a full
minute as the car filled with water.

49:25.963 --> 49:27.544
What was he doing all that time?

49:29.633 --> 49:31.043
He should've done more.

49:32.636 --> 49:35.252
- Don't you think he...
- He didn't fucking try hard enough!

49:38.559 --> 49:39.719
Did you hear that?

49:42.938 --> 49:44.018
Hey.

49:47.526 --> 49:49.391
Don't be ashamed.

49:49.487 --> 49:51.728
I've seen plenty of tough guys cry.

49:54.700 --> 49:56.361
I'm not my father.

49:58.496 --> 49:59.861
Max, what the hell?

50:05.252 --> 50:06.992
Christ. Give me that!

50:07.087 --> 50:08.952
Are you out of your goddamn mind?

50:11.509 --> 50:12.589
Let's go.

50:14.094 --> 50:16.380
Please tell me there's
another way out of this room.

50:17.598 --> 50:18.713
Check this out.

50:21.727 --> 50:22.807
What is it?

50:22.895 --> 50:25.123
This is how they got the liquor up here
without anybody noticing.

50:25.147 --> 50:26.507
Come on. It's our way out of here.

50:28.025 --> 50:30.767
Okay. Okay.

50:30.861 --> 50:32.977
Well, there are six more rooms.

50:33.072 --> 50:36.360
If we have to tear down every wall,
we're gonna be here until Christmas.

50:40.162 --> 50:42.073
So what now, Mr. Dubois?

50:46.752 --> 50:47.992
They're here.

50:51.382 --> 50:52.588
They have to be.

50:59.014 --> 51:01.221
Okay, slowly. Slowly.

51:26.375 --> 51:27.660
Watch out, man, I got this.

51:27.751 --> 51:28.751
Go!

51:32.047 --> 51:37.337
You have amassed quite a library
over the years, Mr. Stanton.

51:38.887 --> 51:44.257
The books I've collected
have been an important part of my work.

51:44.351 --> 51:48.014
With a distinct bent
towards British history.

51:51.358 --> 51:53.519
Well, you can take the boy out of england,

51:53.611 --> 51:56.444
but you can't take england out of the boy.

51:59.533 --> 52:01.740
You must have spent a small fortune

52:01.827 --> 52:05.695
to build shelves capable
of storing your collection.

52:06.707 --> 52:08.618
The former tenant built the library.

52:08.709 --> 52:11.121
It was one of the main reasons
why we bought this place.

52:15.507 --> 52:16.792
What the hell are you doing?

52:16.884 --> 52:19.717
I never knew dreischler
to be a big reader.

52:19.803 --> 52:22.840
- Dreischler?
- Your Mr. hersch.

52:38.697 --> 52:40.858
Borz, get the tools!

52:46.664 --> 52:49.997
A customized mosler from the early "80s,
four-wheel combination lock.

52:51.627 --> 52:52.958
This isn't gonna be easy.

52:53.045 --> 52:54.376
How long?

52:54.463 --> 52:58.001
Good safecracker would get you
inside within five hours.

52:59.009 --> 53:01.591
- I'll do it in two.
- Do it in one.

53:12.356 --> 53:16.190
No, no, no. We need the water
to cool the drill bit, man. Yeah.

53:16.276 --> 53:18.267
Grab the hose
and hook it up in the kitchen.

53:18.362 --> 53:21.946
You're telling me what to do now?
Who put you in charge?

53:22.032 --> 53:23.988
Get him what he needs.

53:28.747 --> 53:31.864
I opened a vintage bottle of wine
for the holidays.

53:33.127 --> 53:34.867
Would you care to join me for a glass?

53:34.962 --> 53:36.748
That would be splendid.

53:45.180 --> 53:46.260
Would you like some?

53:49.017 --> 53:50.723
Huh. I'll take that as a no.

54:12.458 --> 54:14.369
Here we are, Mr. Dubois. Enjoy.

54:18.046 --> 54:20.708
Mm. That's an old Italian.

54:21.717 --> 54:23.378
I prefer Bordeaux.

54:24.970 --> 54:27.302
- Hmm.
- It was a gift.

54:27.389 --> 54:29.300
I'm not much of a connoisseur myself.

54:33.103 --> 54:35.264
Sweetheart, can you
hold this for a second?

55:12.184 --> 55:14.015
Not like your video games, is it?

55:27.866 --> 55:28.866
Turn around.

55:39.336 --> 55:42.544
I've been wondering
how long ago you met Mr. hersch.

55:43.757 --> 55:45.497
Why do you ask?

55:45.592 --> 55:48.675
Oh, just habit. Too many years
in research libraries.

55:48.762 --> 55:51.048
My wife used to say I asked
too many questions.

55:52.099 --> 55:54.260
Over 30 years.

55:54.351 --> 55:55.636
Oh, interesting.

55:55.727 --> 55:57.433
A frenchman and a German.

55:57.521 --> 55:58.601
Is the water running?

55:59.606 --> 56:00.812
What's it look like?

56:05.612 --> 56:07.853
Historically speaking,
you haven't always gotten along.

56:07.948 --> 56:10.610
We had common business interests.

56:10.701 --> 56:11.701
Oh, borz.

56:13.412 --> 56:15.573
Uh, where did you meet him?

56:17.165 --> 56:21.204
He doesn't strike me as intelligent enough
to move in your circles.

56:21.295 --> 56:23.411
Let me guess. Uh, prison?

56:24.840 --> 56:28.833
You've done a splendid job of deduction,
Mr. Stanton.

56:28.927 --> 56:30.883
Borz and I did meet in prison.

56:30.971 --> 56:33.303
I don't think you should give him
this kind of information.

56:34.308 --> 56:36.765
Down, borz. It is okay.

56:38.604 --> 56:40.515
Borz, I need a hand.

56:41.732 --> 56:42.847
Coming.

56:46.570 --> 56:48.106
- Damn it.
- They locked us in.

56:54.995 --> 56:56.280
Phones are dead.

56:56.371 --> 56:58.327
Hey, do you know where
the main panel is?

56:58.415 --> 57:00.076
Yeah, control room. This way.

57:06.089 --> 57:09.673
Okay, well, you can forget about getting
the phone lines to work again.

57:10.802 --> 57:12.212
What about the fire alarm?

57:12.304 --> 57:13.304
That's a good idea.

57:14.348 --> 57:15.508
Okay.

57:20.145 --> 57:21.145
Okay.

57:31.323 --> 57:33.314
Boom. One down!

57:33.408 --> 57:37.026
May I ask...
What you're looking for?

57:37.120 --> 57:39.202
Perhaps I can help.

57:39.289 --> 57:41.871
What have you learned is my passion?

57:41.959 --> 57:43.665
Well, your love for art.

57:43.752 --> 57:47.119
And how long ago did I meet Mr. hersch?

57:47.214 --> 57:49.500
Over 30 years.

57:49.591 --> 57:51.798
In east Germany, to be precise.

57:51.885 --> 57:54.422
And you, the learned scholar,

57:54.513 --> 57:58.552
can you tell me what were the most
prominent events there at that time?

57:58.642 --> 58:02.226
The last days of
the German Democratic Republic,

58:02.312 --> 58:04.112
the fall of east Berlin,
the wall coming down.

58:04.189 --> 58:05.770
Bravo.

58:05.857 --> 58:10.772
Dreischler... I mean, your Mr. hersch
was in charge of the koko program,

58:10.862 --> 58:16.653
requisitioning the most valuable assets
of east German citizens.

58:16.743 --> 58:18.779
I see.

58:18.870 --> 58:23.204
And you were brought in to fence them off,
to finance a bankrupt government.

58:23.291 --> 58:28.081
I was trying to save those works
so the rest of the world could enjoy them.

58:28.171 --> 58:29.911
If it weren't for my efforts,

58:30.007 --> 58:34.171
they could have been lost
forever behind an iron curtain.

58:36.263 --> 58:37.628
Gosh, you delude yourself.

58:37.723 --> 58:39.839
I came to take what is mine, professor!

58:39.933 --> 58:43.141
I paid for it
with the best years of my life.

58:45.897 --> 58:47.637
Hey! What are you doing?

58:47.733 --> 58:48.733
Give me that.

58:50.986 --> 58:52.522
What?

58:52.612 --> 58:53.818
So what do we do now?

58:55.449 --> 58:56.564
Delete it.

58:56.658 --> 58:58.865
- You come here.
- No, don't touch my daughter!

58:58.952 --> 59:00.032
Daddy!

59:01.455 --> 59:02.820
Yeah, come on. Come on.

59:02.914 --> 59:04.495
- Stop!
- Come on. Come on.

59:06.918 --> 59:09.330
Remember, we are civilized.

59:10.338 --> 59:11.623
You talk too much.

59:12.924 --> 59:14.130
Delete it!

59:17.095 --> 59:19.962
Okay. All right, pull that.

59:26.938 --> 59:27.938
Got it. Let's go.

59:33.195 --> 59:34.401
What is that?

59:34.488 --> 59:35.648
It's the fire alarm.

59:35.739 --> 59:38.151
I know it's the fire alarm, you idiot.

59:38.241 --> 59:41.859
I specifically instructed you
to disable it.

59:43.914 --> 59:45.120
I'll handle it.

59:57.344 --> 59:58.344
Ali?

01:00:04.851 --> 01:00:06.557
Can you come in here for a second?

01:00:12.442 --> 01:00:14.728
Drop the guns. Slowly.

01:00:19.491 --> 01:00:20.697
Step away from the door.

01:00:22.119 --> 01:00:23.325
Behind the wall.

01:00:24.913 --> 01:00:28.280
One word from you, and I'll shoot the kid.
Understood?

01:00:30.710 --> 01:00:32.746
- Come on!
- I'm coming.

01:00:32.838 --> 01:00:33.918
Sorry.

01:00:36.842 --> 01:00:38.332
- What's going on here?
- Hey.

01:00:38.426 --> 01:00:40.883
Um... just a false alarm.

01:00:40.971 --> 01:00:42.757
What do you mean it's a false alarm?

01:00:51.940 --> 01:00:55.182
Some of the contractors
might have crossed the wires.

01:00:55.277 --> 01:00:56.983
Something. I don't know.

01:00:57.070 --> 01:00:58.651
Why is the door locked?

01:00:58.738 --> 01:01:02.651
There's no one else here
because of the remodel,

01:01:02.742 --> 01:01:04.278
except for some construction guys.

01:01:04.369 --> 01:01:07.111
You can't lock the door.
It's illegal and it's dangerous.

01:01:07.205 --> 01:01:09.412
Yeah, but the entire building
is locked down.

01:01:09.499 --> 01:01:12.081
It's closed up, so we're using
the service doors.

01:01:12.169 --> 01:01:13.579
What did I miss?

01:01:13.670 --> 01:01:15.251
- Hi.
- Well...

01:01:15.338 --> 01:01:16.498
It's a false alarm.

01:01:16.590 --> 01:01:18.376
City regulations say we gotta check it.

01:01:18.466 --> 01:01:21.048
- Floor by floor.
- Ten floors? Go ahead.

01:01:21.136 --> 01:01:22.672
Come on, captain.

01:01:22.762 --> 01:01:24.844
Easter dinner's getting cold
at the station.

01:01:24.931 --> 01:01:26.421
Hey, regulations is regulations.

01:01:26.516 --> 01:01:28.928
Come on, chief.
Give your guys a break.

01:01:29.019 --> 01:01:31.886
We can bend the rules a little.
Clearly there's nothing wrong here.

01:01:31.980 --> 01:01:34.392
Absolutely not.
False alarm, a hundred percent.

01:01:35.400 --> 01:01:36.731
All right.

01:01:36.818 --> 01:01:39.935
You just keep your carpenters
away from my fire alarm system.

01:01:40.030 --> 01:01:42.271
Absolutely. Won't happen again, sir.

01:01:42.365 --> 01:01:43.605
Let's go.

01:01:43.700 --> 01:01:46.032
Hey, another false alarm
and you'll get fined.

01:01:46.119 --> 01:01:48.280
Thank you very much, sir.
I highly appreciate it.

01:01:49.289 --> 01:01:51.029
Okay, party's over.

01:01:51.124 --> 01:01:53.410
Thank you. Happy easter!

01:01:59.549 --> 01:02:00.834
Nice try, gorski.

01:02:06.306 --> 01:02:08.171
You aroused my curiosity, though.

01:02:08.266 --> 01:02:11.724
Why would a decorated officer
hole up here as a doorman?

01:02:11.811 --> 01:02:13.893
To meet interesting people like you.

01:02:15.607 --> 01:02:17.598
I had a friend...

01:02:17.692 --> 01:02:21.105
That came back after war,
and he was damaged.

01:02:21.196 --> 01:02:23.687
Are you damaged, soldier?

01:02:26.284 --> 01:02:27.899
Not as damaged as you.

01:02:33.291 --> 01:02:34.326
What about this...

01:02:41.216 --> 01:02:42.672
Get their guns!

01:02:46.096 --> 01:02:48.508
Take the gun.
Max, give me the rifle.

01:02:48.598 --> 01:02:49.878
Find a way out. You go that way.

01:02:50.892 --> 01:02:52.632
Come on. Get her!

01:02:57.774 --> 01:02:59.435
There she is! Hey!

01:05:34.264 --> 01:05:35.264
Find the kid.

01:05:37.183 --> 01:05:38.639
I'm gonna kill that bitch.

01:06:49.047 --> 01:06:53.006
Yeah, the car runs
on an app, and the app needs a signal.

01:06:54.302 --> 01:06:55.792
- Oh, my god.
- Right.

01:06:55.887 --> 01:06:57.718
So halfway up a mountain,
no one for miles..

01:06:57.805 --> 01:06:59.511
Officer.

01:06:59.599 --> 01:07:02.261
What is it? You okay?

01:07:02.352 --> 01:07:05.039
There are terrorists in the carrington.
You've got to call police, SWAT, everyone.

01:07:05.063 --> 01:07:07.179
Hold on, hold on.
Terrorists in the carrington?

01:07:07.273 --> 01:07:08.979
My dad and sister,
they've been kidnapped.

01:07:09.067 --> 01:07:11.103
Kidnapped?

01:07:11.194 --> 01:07:15.483
This is 105 Charlie. I got a 10-10 here
at 85th and central park west.

01:07:15.573 --> 01:07:17.234
Yeah, there's a kid that claims

01:07:17.325 --> 01:07:19.236
the carrington's been
taken over by terrorists.

01:07:19.327 --> 01:07:21.613
- What's your name?
- Max Stanton.

01:07:21.704 --> 01:07:23.444
His name is Max Stanton.

01:07:24.582 --> 01:07:26.072
They want to speak to you.

01:07:28.294 --> 01:07:30.250
- Hello?
- Hello, Max.

01:07:30.338 --> 01:07:31.828
We miss you up here.

01:07:33.258 --> 01:07:34.589
Let's go, kid.

01:07:34.676 --> 01:07:37.042
- Stay back.
- Whoa! Hold on, easy.

01:07:38.346 --> 01:07:39.882
How about you give me that gun, kid?

01:07:39.973 --> 01:07:41.713
- I'll shoot you, you cocksucker.
- Yeah?

01:07:41.808 --> 01:07:44.094
You gonna spray my brains
all over the car?

01:07:53.486 --> 01:07:54.521
Good boy.

01:08:03.288 --> 01:08:05.574
How's it going? Huh?

01:08:19.345 --> 01:08:20.755
Ms. gorski.

01:08:27.478 --> 01:08:28.809
Ms. gorski?

01:08:34.861 --> 01:08:37.523
Ms. gorski, can you hear me?

01:08:37.613 --> 01:08:39.696
Whoever you are
and whatever you're up to,

01:08:39.782 --> 01:08:41.363
you should walk away now.

01:08:41.451 --> 01:08:43.942
Someone's bringing in
the police to bring you down.

01:08:44.037 --> 01:08:46.528
And if they don't stop you, I will.

01:08:46.622 --> 01:08:50.081
Things don't always work out
as we might wish.

01:08:50.167 --> 01:08:51.453
You, of all people,

01:08:51.544 --> 01:08:55.252
should understand that, sergeant gorski.

01:08:55.340 --> 01:08:59.629
By the way, I have someone here
who wants to say hello.

01:09:02.764 --> 01:09:04.220
I'm sorry, all.

01:09:08.060 --> 01:09:10.551
The Internet is a marvelous invention.

01:09:11.606 --> 01:09:13.562
I was fascinated to read

01:09:13.649 --> 01:09:17.484
about what happened while you were
in the service at the embassy.

01:09:17.569 --> 01:09:21.483
Unless you want more innocent
blood on your hands,

01:09:21.573 --> 01:09:26.694
be here in 15 minutes, unarmed,
and surrender. It's over.

01:09:42.386 --> 01:09:45.299
Come on, come on. Now, right?
Like, that's nothing.

01:09:50.937 --> 01:09:52.643
Two! Whoo!

01:09:58.903 --> 01:09:59.903
Ali?

01:10:04.242 --> 01:10:07.450
Nothing's going to happen to you, okay?
Nothing's going to happen to you.

01:12:07.031 --> 01:12:08.146
Why did you stop?

01:12:09.367 --> 01:12:12.780
There's no water and we need water.

01:12:12.870 --> 01:12:14.360
Check the faucet.

01:12:19.752 --> 01:12:20.867
Nothing.

01:12:22.129 --> 01:12:23.164
I eo!

01:12:23.256 --> 01:12:25.167
- Yeah?
- Can you check the bathroom?

01:12:40.356 --> 01:12:43.769
- No water in the bathroom.
- Is that bitch in the basement?

01:12:44.819 --> 01:12:47.151
We have no time for this. Keep drilling.

01:12:47.238 --> 01:12:48.944
Uh, no. No, no, no.

01:12:49.031 --> 01:12:52.944
You see, the drill bit, it'll break.
We need the water to keep it cool.

01:12:53.035 --> 01:12:55.742
Keep drilling! That's an order.

01:12:56.956 --> 01:12:58.947
Okay. Okay.

01:13:14.390 --> 01:13:17.006
I've got... we need water.

01:13:17.101 --> 01:13:18.181
Merde.

01:13:19.186 --> 01:13:21.518
He created this mess, you fix it.

01:13:21.606 --> 01:13:24.268
Go! Turn on the water.

01:13:25.276 --> 01:13:26.311
Yes, sir.

01:15:12.967 --> 01:15:14.377
Leo, what's going on?

01:15:15.386 --> 01:15:16.671
What's taking so long?

01:15:19.223 --> 01:15:21.589
You know, we are so, so close.

01:15:21.684 --> 01:15:24.175
I mean, I'm on the last lock. Come on.

01:15:25.938 --> 01:15:27.144
Leo?

01:15:32.236 --> 01:15:33.851
He's dead and you're next.

01:15:39.285 --> 01:15:45.576
It seems your doorwoman friend is more
effective than you gave her credit.

01:15:45.666 --> 01:15:48.703
I hear your putdowns.
I don't hear any solutions.

01:15:53.174 --> 01:15:54.174
What?

01:15:55.009 --> 01:15:56.215
Try this one.

01:16:02.308 --> 01:16:05.596
For someone like me
who appreciates fine art,

01:16:05.686 --> 01:16:08.974
I can say your daughter has real talent.

01:16:09.982 --> 01:16:14.772
There is a certain likeness
in her drawing to this photo.

01:16:17.323 --> 01:16:19.689
If you just met sergeant gorski,

01:16:19.784 --> 01:16:24.073
why there is a photo of you
together when you were younger?

01:16:26.874 --> 01:16:31.664
I noticed your daughter's signature
and her reference to "aunt Ali."

01:16:31.754 --> 01:16:37.795
I assume you are related
to the war hero killing all my men.

01:16:40.846 --> 01:16:44.384
Aunt Ali is smarter and stronger
than all of you.

01:16:44.475 --> 01:16:45.885
Honey. Honey, come here.

01:16:46.936 --> 01:16:48.597
Did I say something wrong?

01:16:48.687 --> 01:16:50.894
A

01:16:50.981 --> 01:16:53.438
Quite to the contrary.
You said something right.

01:16:53.526 --> 01:16:54.526
Thank you.

01:16:56.862 --> 01:17:01.697
It appears you have been withholding
important information from us.

01:17:01.784 --> 01:17:07.245
I understand this kind of publicity
can get you discharged from the military.

01:17:07.331 --> 01:17:09.697
Isn't that true, aunt Ali?

01:17:14.922 --> 01:17:17.755
- Let them go, or I will...
- Listen to me.

01:17:17.842 --> 01:17:20.709
For every ten minutes
that pass without water,

01:17:20.803 --> 01:17:23.670
a member of your family will lose a limb.

01:17:23.764 --> 01:17:25.846
Now, turn on the water!

01:17:28.936 --> 01:17:31.678
Wait! The main water valve
has been destroyed.

01:17:34.108 --> 01:17:35.439
But I have a plan.

01:17:47.037 --> 01:17:48.197
Aunt Ali!

01:17:48.289 --> 01:17:49.745
Welcome, sergeant gorski.

01:17:51.333 --> 01:17:52.789
I am Victor Dubois.

01:17:54.587 --> 01:17:56.919
I accept your total surrender.

01:18:01.427 --> 01:18:03.588
Now listen to me, Victor.

01:18:03.679 --> 01:18:07.012
Once I get the water,
you release my family, and if you don't...

01:18:08.017 --> 01:18:09.348
I will take you to hell.

01:18:11.854 --> 01:18:16.644
I'm impressed someone in your position
negotiates from an illusion of strength.

01:18:18.027 --> 01:18:20.268
We have already established our terms.

01:18:21.280 --> 01:18:22.690
Now, the water.

01:18:41.342 --> 01:18:42.832
Officer Olsen, get up here.

01:19:02.321 --> 01:19:03.606
Now we wait.

01:19:07.534 --> 01:19:08.819
- We're back!
- Good.

01:19:08.911 --> 01:19:10.151
We got water!

01:19:15.709 --> 01:19:17.119
I kept up my end of the bargain.

01:19:18.128 --> 01:19:19.288
Now it's yours.

01:19:36.939 --> 01:19:37.939
We're in!

01:19:38.023 --> 01:19:39.023
We are in.

01:19:40.025 --> 01:19:41.060
We.

01:19:42.152 --> 01:19:45.565
Are... in. Okay.

01:19:52.913 --> 01:19:53.948
Careful.

01:20:09.763 --> 01:20:11.003
Yeah.

01:20:11.098 --> 01:20:12.588
- Very good.
- Remove the box.

01:20:12.683 --> 01:20:13.718
Yes, sir.

01:20:23.444 --> 01:20:25.025
Is that what you were after?

01:20:25.112 --> 01:20:26.568
Nothing is...

01:20:28.532 --> 01:20:31.274
As it appears, Mr. Stanton.

01:20:33.996 --> 01:20:35.577
It's a caravaggio.

01:20:37.082 --> 01:20:38.743
The nativity with St. Francis.

01:20:54.516 --> 01:20:55.596
Rembrandt.

01:20:56.643 --> 01:20:58.053
It's a bloody Rembrandt.

01:21:20.167 --> 01:21:21.577
Bring the tubes.

01:21:24.380 --> 01:21:26.962
Be careful. Roll them gently.

01:21:30.969 --> 01:21:32.809
Do you know how much
these paintings are worth?

01:21:32.846 --> 01:21:35.679
- How much?
- Borz, time is of the essence.

01:21:35.766 --> 01:21:39.634
I don't know, $60 to $80 million.

01:21:40.938 --> 01:21:43.304
These paintings are worth $80 million?

01:21:43.399 --> 01:21:45.310
No, no, no. Each one.

01:21:49.446 --> 01:21:52.438
You told me these paintings
were worth $5 million Max...

01:21:52.533 --> 01:21:54.114
We have an agreement.

01:21:54.201 --> 01:21:57.614
Said fee for services rendered.
End of discussion.

01:22:03.502 --> 01:22:04.833
Lily! Lily, get down.

01:22:10.509 --> 01:22:11.999
We don't have time for this.

01:22:12.094 --> 01:22:14.676
I absolutely agree. Pull the trigger
and see what happens.

01:22:18.976 --> 01:22:23.345
Do either of you know
how to move fine art?

01:22:27.693 --> 01:22:28.853
Do you know?

01:22:31.071 --> 01:22:34.734
Twenty-five percent for the both of us,
50% for you.

01:22:38.287 --> 01:22:39.902
Or we can all go down here.

01:22:44.168 --> 01:22:47.160
You're really coming into your own,
you know that?

01:22:58.474 --> 01:23:01.136
- Let's go.
- Okay.

01:23:04.354 --> 01:23:06.390
- Get up. Get up!
- Okay.

01:23:06.482 --> 01:23:08.268
Nobody moves!

01:23:08.358 --> 01:23:10.349
- No, no, no. Max!
- Sit down!

01:23:10.444 --> 01:23:11.809
Sit the fuck down!

01:23:11.904 --> 01:23:13.235
Or I shoot the kid.

01:23:16.033 --> 01:23:17.239
Let him go.

01:23:21.121 --> 01:23:22.031
Martinez.

01:23:22.122 --> 01:23:23.578
Yeah?

01:23:23.665 --> 01:23:25.201
Guess it's a fifty-fifty.

01:23:25.292 --> 01:23:26.782
What?

01:23:33.717 --> 01:23:34.752
- Dad!
- No!

01:23:34.843 --> 01:23:36.253
Daddy!

01:23:47.397 --> 01:23:49.103
You should've taken a day off.

01:23:52.069 --> 01:23:53.309
Nol

01:23:53.403 --> 01:23:54.939
quick, quick!

01:23:59.576 --> 01:24:01.817
Dad! Dad, are you all right?

01:24:01.912 --> 01:24:03.322
It's okay.

01:24:04.331 --> 01:24:05.867
I underestimated you.

01:24:05.958 --> 01:24:07.289
Yeah, and I, you.

01:24:07.376 --> 01:24:08.912
Your dad's gonna be fine,

01:24:09.002 --> 01:24:11.744
but right now, I need you to be
his water wings, okay?

01:24:11.838 --> 01:24:13.669
So grab this.
Right here, hold it down.

01:24:15.842 --> 01:24:17.332
- Daddy? Daddy.
- I'm okay.

01:24:17.427 --> 01:24:19.088
- Daddy, I...
- I'm all right. I'm okay.

01:24:19.179 --> 01:24:21.090
Max, are you okay?

01:24:21.181 --> 01:24:22.717
I'm fine.

01:24:24.768 --> 01:24:26.008
Go get 'em.

01:24:30.899 --> 01:24:32.059
I'm gonna be okay.

01:24:38.323 --> 01:24:39.779
Go! Go! Go!

01:24:46.415 --> 01:24:48.246
- Hold it.
- Oh, my god! Don't shoot.

01:24:48.333 --> 01:24:50.603
- Hold it right there.
- I'm a doorman. I'm just a doorman.

01:24:50.627 --> 01:24:53.118
A woman went crazy.
She took her family hostage upstairs.

01:24:53.213 --> 01:24:55.149
She's coming down the stairs
right now. She's got a gun!

01:24:55.173 --> 01:24:57.084
Alpha team, spread out.

01:24:57.175 --> 01:25:00.087
Move to the exit, sir.
Move. Move, move, move.

01:25:01.597 --> 01:25:02.632
Seal the street.

01:25:05.767 --> 01:25:06.927
The building's surrounded.

01:25:07.936 --> 01:25:09.301
Plan b.

01:25:18.822 --> 01:25:20.403
Drop your weapon!

01:25:20.490 --> 01:25:21.570
Wait, wait.

01:25:21.658 --> 01:25:23.865
My brother-in-law is wounded
on the tenth floor.

01:25:23.952 --> 01:25:25.783
- He needs a medic.
- Drop it now!

01:25:25.871 --> 01:25:28.408
Please, it's not me.
It's borz, the doorman.

01:25:28.498 --> 01:25:33.492
Step away from the weapon
and stand up slowly.

01:25:56.401 --> 01:25:58.392
I'm happy, borz. You've changed.

01:25:58.487 --> 01:25:59.727
Merde.

01:26:03.283 --> 01:26:04.398
Yes, I have.

01:26:06.912 --> 01:26:08.243
One hundred percent.

01:26:10.624 --> 01:26:11.955
Borz.

01:26:30.894 --> 01:26:31.894
Borz!

01:26:35.565 --> 01:26:37.806
You're persistent, sergeant.
I'll give you that.

01:26:39.111 --> 01:26:40.976
We have enough kissing ass
to do around here.

01:26:41.071 --> 01:26:43.027
We don't have to do it to each other.

01:26:43.115 --> 01:26:44.195
I et's finish this.

01:27:50.640 --> 01:27:52.255
What are you doing? No, no, no!

01:27:52.350 --> 01:27:53.715
No! No!

01:28:00.442 --> 01:28:01.727
Are you crazy?!

01:28:34.643 --> 01:28:36.133
I knew you were sick.

01:28:37.395 --> 01:28:39.886
I just didn't realize how sick you were.

01:28:42.150 --> 01:28:43.230
Well, now you know.

01:28:53.703 --> 01:28:54.703
Fuck.

01:29:48.884 --> 01:29:51.375
Right. Do we have everything?

01:29:52.512 --> 01:29:53.512
Good.

01:29:54.389 --> 01:29:55.424
Hey, you.

01:29:57.183 --> 01:29:59.219
I didn't think I'd see you again.

01:29:59.311 --> 01:30:01.302
Thought you'd get rid of me
that easily, huh?

01:30:02.314 --> 01:30:03.554
How is he?

01:30:06.484 --> 01:30:07.564
He's all right.

01:30:10.280 --> 01:30:12.362
I'm sorry, Ali. This is all my fault.

01:30:14.159 --> 01:30:15.399
I couldn't do it.

01:30:16.411 --> 01:30:17.411
Do what?

01:30:18.413 --> 01:30:20.153
Use the gun.

01:30:20.248 --> 01:30:22.239
I wasn't the man you wanted me to be.

01:30:23.251 --> 01:30:25.492
I really like the man you are.

01:30:26.588 --> 01:30:27.794
Come on.

01:30:27.881 --> 01:30:29.746
- Aunt Ali!
- Hi.

01:30:32.594 --> 01:30:34.084
I got you something.

01:30:36.973 --> 01:30:38.053
The mint sauce.

01:30:38.141 --> 01:30:40.632
With pine nuts, of course.

01:30:40.727 --> 01:30:42.092
Where's the lamb?

01:30:42.187 --> 01:30:45.304
The lamb.
I knew I forgot something.

01:30:47.192 --> 01:30:48.523
How are you?

01:30:48.610 --> 01:30:50.646
Oh, I'll manage.

01:30:50.737 --> 01:30:53.854
In a couple of weeks,
I'll be back to my usual boring self.

01:30:55.408 --> 01:30:57.649
- Sir, we should go.
- All right. Jump in.

01:30:58.662 --> 01:31:00.152
Bye, aunt Ali.

01:31:03.291 --> 01:31:04.827
What are you gonna do?

01:31:04.918 --> 01:31:06.829
Well, I won't be working as a doorman.

01:31:11.257 --> 01:31:14.124
We'll be back
after they finish the renovations.

01:31:15.595 --> 01:31:18.302
Maybe you can join us in London
if you're interested.

01:31:19.933 --> 01:31:22.049
I know the kids
would love to see you.

01:31:22.143 --> 01:31:25.135
The kids? What about you?

01:31:48.003 --> 01:31:49.003
See?

01:31:50.130 --> 01:31:52.371
I'm one of those tough guys who can cry.

01:31:53.425 --> 01:31:54.756
Yes, you are.

01:31:56.094 --> 01:31:57.379
Yes, you are.

01:32:09.024 --> 01:32:11.436
Bye, aunt Ali! We'll miss you.
