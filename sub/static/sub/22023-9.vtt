WEBVTT

00:02.320 --> 00:04.513
Five bucks says Best Actor or Actress

00:04.550 --> 00:06.529
dedicates their Golden
Globe to the troops.

00:06.560 --> 00:08.657
I'll bet you ten someone
rolls their R too hard

00:08.690 --> 00:10.324
talking about a foreign film.

00:10.360 --> 00:12.466
Five bucks says they cut to
the wrong person of color

00:12.500 --> 00:13.331
at least twice.

00:13.366 --> 00:15.064
Where are we watching this year?

00:15.100 --> 00:16.539
Jerusha's ovulating,

00:16.570 --> 00:19.063
so we'll probably just have
it on in the background

00:19.100 --> 00:20.160
on a TV on a dresser.

00:21.510 --> 00:23.208
If anyone wants to come to the hospital,

00:23.242 --> 00:24.777
- I'll be watching with Jerry.
- Pass.

00:24.810 --> 00:26.304
Guys, what are you talking about?

00:26.340 --> 00:28.144
We're going to do it at
my place, like always.

00:28.180 --> 00:30.715
- Mm...
- You're doing it this year?

00:30.749 --> 00:34.186
Uh, yeah, why wouldn't I?

00:34.220 --> 00:35.819
- You don't have to.
- That's unnecessary.

00:35.850 --> 00:37.382
I think everybody just thought

00:37.420 --> 00:39.154
you weren't going to
have the party this year,

00:39.190 --> 00:40.829
you know, with your
marriage croaking and all.

00:40.860 --> 00:44.456
What? I am perfectly capable
of throwing a party by myself.

00:45.660 --> 00:47.877
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

00:47.911 --> 00:48.944
I am!

00:49.830 --> 00:51.202
You guys, it's going to be great.

00:51.240 --> 00:52.638
I'm going to barbecue.

00:52.670 --> 00:55.174
You know, Adam was kind of
the barbecue guy, right?

00:55.210 --> 00:56.306
I mean, that brisket?

00:56.340 --> 00:58.714
- So smoky.
- That sauce?

00:58.748 --> 01:00.627
I know where to get
the sauce... that's easy.

01:00.662 --> 01:02.806
You really don't have to do this.

01:02.839 --> 01:04.224
You can host a party next year,

01:04.257 --> 01:05.610
when your life isn't in shambles.

01:05.644 --> 01:07.886
You guys, my life is not in shambles.

01:07.920 --> 01:09.855
He didn't mean shambles.

01:09.889 --> 01:11.923
He meant your life has fallen to pieces.

01:11.958 --> 01:14.259
What do you think shambles are?
They're pieces.

01:14.293 --> 01:16.595
Shambles implies more of
a disaster-wreckage situation.

01:16.629 --> 01:18.864
Um, I'll tell you who deserves an award

01:18.898 --> 01:20.866
for "Life Least in Shambles".

01:20.900 --> 01:22.048
Oh, Rooney Mara.

01:22.083 --> 01:23.806
- Yes.
- She is killing it.

01:23.841 --> 01:26.104
Yes, love her. Also, me.

01:26.139 --> 01:28.301
Guys, Rooney Mara's family
owns two NFL teams.

01:28.337 --> 01:29.856
She was born on third base.

01:29.892 --> 01:31.445
- That's baseball.
- I know sports!

01:31.480 --> 01:36.039
I've got it! Tatters.
Amy's life is in tatters.

01:38.000 --> 01:44.074
Advertise your product or brand here

01:49.330 --> 01:52.928
Oh, Dina. You're three hours early.

01:52.960 --> 01:54.834
Yeah. I came to help you set up.

01:54.871 --> 01:55.969
It's what best friends do.

01:55.970 --> 01:59.037
- Oh! We're best friends.
- Yeah!

01:59.074 --> 02:01.249
Well, I mean, I'm yours.
You're my number four.

02:01.270 --> 02:03.523
And technically,
I count twins as one person.

02:03.631 --> 02:04.681
Come on in.

02:04.682 --> 02:08.243
Oof, guess we are going to
have to prioritize this.

02:08.276 --> 02:09.675
Why don't you tackle the walls?

02:09.708 --> 02:11.648
And I'll try to do something
about that smell.

02:11.680 --> 02:13.786
Where's the white vinegar
and ammonia kept?

02:13.820 --> 02:16.127
There's no smell.
It smells like a regular house.

02:16.162 --> 02:17.465
This is classic us.

02:17.499 --> 02:19.371
I try to improve you, you fight it.

02:19.405 --> 02:22.035
Ultimately, you submit
and are better for it.

02:22.851 --> 02:24.656
I also wouldn't wear this.

02:24.690 --> 02:27.625
Yeah, no, I'm not wearing
sweats to my party.

02:27.660 --> 02:30.565
Great! We are going
to make a swan out of you yet.

02:30.600 --> 02:34.238
Okay, why don't you go change?

02:34.272 --> 02:37.546
And I will do a quick vibrator sweep.

02:41.980 --> 02:43.698
Ugh, I'm overdressed.

02:43.732 --> 02:46.394
I thought going to a Golden
Globes party was like,

02:46.428 --> 02:48.686
you dress for the Golden Globes.

02:48.720 --> 02:50.382
I think you look nice.

02:50.417 --> 02:51.978
I'm just nervous, you know?

02:52.012 --> 02:54.284
I mean, I feel like I'm still
not part of the group.

02:54.320 --> 02:56.656
No, no, you're part of the group.

02:56.690 --> 02:59.224
It's like if this
was the Scooby Doo gang,

02:59.260 --> 03:00.899
you would be Scrappy Doo...

03:00.930 --> 03:03.766
a late addition, but
everybody loved him.

03:03.800 --> 03:05.990
Everyone hated Scrappy Doo.

03:06.025 --> 03:07.271
He only got to hang out with them

03:07.306 --> 03:09.260
because he was related to Scooby.

03:09.295 --> 03:11.882
Whoa, somebody's overdressed.

03:13.340 --> 03:15.501
I've seen less sparkles
at a pride parade.

03:16.711 --> 03:17.856
Did you notice?

03:18.380 --> 03:20.616
All the photos
of Adam are gone.

03:20.650 --> 03:21.947
Yeah, creepy.

03:22.501 --> 03:24.486
Everyone enjoying themselves?

03:24.520 --> 03:27.586
Party pretty shambles-free so far?

03:27.620 --> 03:29.525
- It's fine.
- Yeah, it's cool.

03:29.560 --> 03:31.727
- What are you drinking?
- I'm having a rum and coke.

03:31.760 --> 03:34.453
Ah-ah! I don't think
that's what it's called.

03:37.651 --> 03:39.536
I'm having a Master of Rum.

03:39.570 --> 03:42.536
There you go! Master of Rum! Ha!

03:42.570 --> 03:45.575
I'm going to go fill up
my Handmaid's Ale.

03:45.610 --> 03:48.170
That's a clever name.

03:58.390 --> 04:02.235
Oh!

04:02.790 --> 04:04.756
Ooh!

04:04.790 --> 04:08.636
- Amy!
- Glenn! Jerusha! I'm so glad...

04:08.670 --> 04:11.478
Amy, so sorry to hear about Adam.

04:11.513 --> 04:14.319
Oh, it's okay. It's fine.
It's great, actually.

04:14.354 --> 04:16.427
You know, sometimes
when you aren't happy,

04:16.461 --> 04:19.000
it's better to be divorced
than to stay in the marriage.

04:19.035 --> 04:20.605
Yeah, that's why we...

04:20.640 --> 04:22.849
A lot of people are happier
after they get divorced

04:22.850 --> 04:23.900
than when they were married.

04:23.901 --> 04:26.037
- Yeah, no, I know...
- Like Jennifer Lopez.

04:26.073 --> 04:29.205
- I read an article.
- I read it, too.

04:29.240 --> 04:31.521
- I read it, then he read it.
- Totally.

04:32.005 --> 04:34.669
- Yeah, that's very interesting.
- Oh, I made you...

04:36.086 --> 04:38.095
a hummingbird.

04:38.130 --> 04:39.763
- Wow.
- Jerusha has a knack

04:39.798 --> 04:43.431
for finding the perfect animal
for anybody's personality.

04:43.465 --> 04:47.066
- I do, I do.
- I'm a Labrador.

04:47.100 --> 04:48.703
Well, thank you. Thanks.

04:48.740 --> 04:53.702
I am going to put that where
people put things like this.

04:53.737 --> 04:55.927
Unfortunately, we can't stay long,

04:55.962 --> 04:59.794
'cause we have to go home
early to... make a baby.

04:59.830 --> 05:03.148
Well, we're going to try,
Together, the two of us,

05:03.184 --> 05:04.689
with his, in my...

05:04.690 --> 05:05.703
Jerusha.

05:09.830 --> 05:12.826
<i>♪ Let's get real, let's get heavy ♪</i>

05:12.860 --> 05:16.465
<i>♪ Till the water breaks
the levy, let's get loose. ♪</i>

05:16.500 --> 05:17.637
Oh, my God, you know who I saw

05:17.670 --> 05:18.968
at the gas station the other day?

05:19.000 --> 05:20.469
- Who?
- Mustard man.

05:20.470 --> 05:22.809
- No!
- How was he?

05:22.840 --> 05:25.745
Yes, was
he pumping petrol?

05:25.780 --> 05:28.616
Where might
I find the ah-loo-minium?

05:28.650 --> 05:31.987
Right next to the vit-ah-mins.

05:32.020 --> 05:33.380
Who is this?

05:33.420 --> 05:35.676
Uh, it was from before you started.

05:35.710 --> 05:37.701
It was this guy that used
to come in all the time.

05:37.735 --> 05:40.556
And... and he liked mustard?

05:40.590 --> 05:42.503
And he liked mustard?

05:42.537 --> 05:45.011
- Are you making fun of us?
- Oh, no.

05:45.044 --> 05:49.037
No, he was just, like, um,
this, like, old, fancy guy.

05:49.070 --> 05:52.006
You know, like from the
Grey Poupon commercials.

05:52.040 --> 05:53.348
Uh, pardon me,

05:53.383 --> 05:56.704
but do you have any bags of mulch?

05:56.739 --> 05:58.550
He sounded exactly like that.

05:58.585 --> 06:00.430
I don't think I've seen that commercial.

06:00.464 --> 06:02.746
Yeah, yeah, you have.
It's from the '90s.

06:02.780 --> 06:05.160
- The Grey Poupon commercial.
- Mm-mm.

06:05.194 --> 06:07.774
How have you never seen
the Grey Poupon commercial?

06:07.808 --> 06:11.796
I don't know. But it sounds funny.

06:11.830 --> 06:13.629
It wasn't.

06:16.222 --> 06:17.463
It wasn't.

06:24.500 --> 06:26.689
Oh, no.

06:27.985 --> 06:29.875
No.

06:32.698 --> 06:35.584
So it took all three frogs
to say "Budweiser"?

06:35.618 --> 06:38.803
The sounds they made
together was "Budweiser."

06:38.837 --> 06:40.321
It wasn't that they were saying it.

06:40.322 --> 06:42.885
Those were just the sounds
that they made as frogs.

06:42.920 --> 06:44.945
I-I don't know how to
explain any more, okay?

06:44.979 --> 06:47.250
But people in America thought it
was pretty darn impressive, so...

06:47.251 --> 06:49.166
It was, like, a really big commercial.

06:49.199 --> 06:50.926
Is this like a "Mannequin" situation?

06:50.960 --> 06:54.926
Um, hey. Jonah, could I get
your help for a minute?

06:54.960 --> 06:57.824
Uh, yeah, sure. Um, I'll be right back.

07:00.763 --> 07:02.719
Whassup?

07:02.752 --> 07:05.206
- Whassup?
- Whassup?

07:05.240 --> 07:08.124
- You remember that one.
- Oh, yeah.

07:08.158 --> 07:09.801
Right?

07:11.110 --> 07:14.543
So I put the food on the
grill three hours ago.

07:14.580 --> 07:18.187
Turns out there was nothing
in the propane tank, so...

07:18.222 --> 07:21.553
Mm. We could present it as tartare?

07:21.588 --> 07:24.362
Okay, relax. You're putting
too much pressure on the food.

07:24.399 --> 07:26.166
People aren't here to eat barbecue.

07:26.203 --> 07:28.456
They're here to hang out
and watch the Globes.

07:28.493 --> 07:31.371
Yeah, yeah. Okay. Yeah, you're right.

07:31.407 --> 07:34.667
Amy, um, your TV's not working.

07:39.240 --> 07:40.511
- No.
- No.

07:40.547 --> 07:41.855
I don't get it.

07:41.891 --> 07:43.093
Why do you have all these remotes

07:43.129 --> 07:44.506
that do absolutely nothing?

07:44.544 --> 07:45.879
I mean, this is a
straight-up calculator.

07:45.880 --> 07:47.547
- Oh!
- You have another calculator.

07:48.061 --> 07:49.247
You have a third calculator in here.

07:49.275 --> 07:49.989
I mean, they're useful.

07:49.990 --> 07:51.221
Hey, have you tried unplugging it

07:51.250 --> 07:52.419
and then plugging it back in?

07:52.420 --> 07:55.323
That always worked on
my aunt's breathing machine.

07:55.324 --> 07:56.688
Why don't you just call Adam?

07:56.689 --> 07:59.151
I'm not going to call
up my ex and ask him,

07:59.194 --> 08:01.512
"How do I turn on the TV?"
That would be weird.

08:01.513 --> 08:04.069
It could be the thing
that brings you back together.

08:04.070 --> 08:05.760
Men love a woman in need.

08:05.761 --> 08:09.138
When Glenn and I were dating,
I faked a lot of heart attacks.

08:09.170 --> 08:12.052
"Oh, my God,
don't die, don't die."

08:12.087 --> 08:13.527
That's how we got to first base.

08:13.562 --> 08:15.140
Oh, my God, I can't even with this.

08:15.175 --> 08:16.478
Okay, I'm going to go watch it at home.

08:16.514 --> 08:18.747
No, no, no, no, no, no. Please stay.

08:18.748 --> 08:21.723
Emma knows how to fix the TV.
I'll just call her real quick.

08:21.724 --> 08:23.099
Nobody go anywhere.

08:23.750 --> 08:25.639
Oh, Amy, you remember Jerry.

08:25.640 --> 08:29.441
Uh, yeah. Jerry, hi. You made it.

08:29.442 --> 08:32.066
It's his first time out
since the coma, so...

08:32.100 --> 08:33.232
Say hi, Jerry.

08:37.499 --> 08:40.332
Just give him one second. He's got it.

08:42.039 --> 08:43.943
Hi, Jerry.

08:43.945 --> 08:46.779
- Oh.
- I heard "Amy."

08:46.780 --> 08:48.009
Good job!

08:48.010 --> 08:49.512
- Great.
- That's really good.

08:49.546 --> 08:51.016
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

08:51.050 --> 08:53.347
He's doing good. That was really good.

08:53.380 --> 08:55.122
We're doing this.

08:55.157 --> 08:59.078
We can park this car.

09:01.190 --> 09:04.039
Yes. Crank it... Oh.

09:04.073 --> 09:06.730
Okay, one more time, one more time.

09:07.197 --> 09:08.637
People are getting antsy.

09:08.670 --> 09:10.449
Maybe we should just order pizza...

09:10.482 --> 09:12.067
No, we're not ordering pizza.

09:12.100 --> 09:13.704
I can't have the TV not work
and not do the barbecue.

09:13.740 --> 09:15.565
That plays right
into this "shambles" narrative.

09:15.598 --> 09:17.472
And we're just pretending
your life is fine?

09:17.473 --> 09:19.247
Yes. I mean, it is.

09:19.280 --> 09:20.597
That was good, I believed that.

09:20.599 --> 09:23.465
Okay, I'm just going to microwave it.

09:23.502 --> 09:25.643
- Oh, no, no, no, no
- I don't think that's...

09:25.680 --> 09:28.348
That's probably not going
to be very appetizing.

09:28.380 --> 09:30.524
It's fine, we'll just put sauce on it.

09:30.559 --> 09:32.670
How thick is the sauce?

09:33.617 --> 09:34.973
Who are you wearing?

09:36.190 --> 09:38.116
Oh, I don't know.

09:38.151 --> 09:39.603
I can check the label.

09:39.638 --> 09:41.936
It doesn't matter.
I don't know designers.

09:41.970 --> 09:44.237
- I'm Jerusha.
- Kelly.

09:44.270 --> 09:46.361
I feel like I overdressed.

09:46.396 --> 09:48.022
When I saw you across the room,

09:48.056 --> 09:49.763
I thought you were a prostitute.

09:50.713 --> 09:52.306
That's a compliment.

09:52.340 --> 09:54.673
Oh, thank you.

09:54.710 --> 09:56.038
You're welcome.

09:58.245 --> 10:01.448
I'm going to make you...

10:01.482 --> 10:02.703
a squirrel.

10:03.529 --> 10:07.037
Some people think squirrels
are just rats, but they're not.

10:08.220 --> 10:09.167
Ok...

10:09.916 --> 10:12.060
It was nice talking to you.

10:13.075 --> 10:15.068
The reception in this area is horrible.

10:15.102 --> 10:17.396
Must be the old magnet factory.

10:17.430 --> 10:19.382
- Oh, okay.
- I hope everyone's hungry,

10:19.418 --> 10:21.235
'cause the meat looks real meaty.

10:21.270 --> 10:22.975
Hey, Amy, what's your Wi-Fi password?

10:23.010 --> 10:24.127
Oh, um, I don't know it.

10:24.160 --> 10:25.437
You don't know your own password?

10:25.470 --> 10:27.703
No, because Adam made the password,

10:27.740 --> 10:28.978
and I can't remember it,

10:29.010 --> 10:30.377
and you have to have
a password to get online

10:30.410 --> 10:32.115
to change the password,
and I don't have the password,

10:32.150 --> 10:33.380
- so I can't do that.
- Ugh, you know what?

10:33.380 --> 10:35.280
We should just all go to P.F.
Chang's and watch it there.

10:35.280 --> 10:37.014
No, no, no!

10:37.050 --> 10:38.387
No, then you're going to miss

10:38.420 --> 10:40.803
all my snarky comments
about the dresses.

10:40.838 --> 10:42.415
Oh, you mean when you say
the person just looks like

10:42.450 --> 10:44.296
whatever fruit
the color of the dress is?

10:44.330 --> 10:46.763
Remember, last time, when
Natalie Portman looked like

10:46.800 --> 10:48.083
a sexy banana, and I was like,

10:48.116 --> 10:50.266
"Girl, go on with your banana self"?

10:50.300 --> 10:54.166
Let's go.

10:54.200 --> 10:56.336
<i>♪ You can do it,
put your back into it. ♪</i>

10:56.370 --> 10:58.704
<i>♪ You can do it,
put your into it. ♪</i>

10:58.740 --> 11:01.476
<i>♪ You can do it,
put your back in to it. ♪</i>

11:03.608 --> 11:05.452
Wait. What... No, what is that?

11:05.477 --> 11:06.718
- Hmm?
- What are you doing?

11:06.750 --> 11:08.179
We got to go... right now. Sorry.

11:08.180 --> 11:09.966
No, no, no, dinner's almost ready.

11:10.000 --> 11:12.724
Oh, yeah, no, it's a great
Golden Globes party.

11:12.725 --> 11:14.472
Thank you. And it's going
to be even better

11:14.504 --> 11:16.197
when you get the food
and the Golden Globes on.

11:16.230 --> 11:17.824
No, but once you leave,

11:17.860 --> 11:19.616
then everyone else is going
to think it's okay to leave.

11:19.650 --> 11:22.466
Yeah, I know, but Jerusha
is ovulating right now.

11:22.499 --> 11:24.885
Amy, I don't know how
many good eggs she has left,

11:24.919 --> 11:28.129
you know, what, with her age
and all that line dancing.

11:28.584 --> 11:29.776
I'm sorry.

11:30.088 --> 11:30.811
No.

11:32.210 --> 11:33.143
Do it here.

11:33.828 --> 11:35.767
- What?
- Do it here.

11:35.917 --> 11:39.119
- I-I couldn't.
- Yes, you can. Why not?

11:39.120 --> 11:40.967
Please, Glenn, please.

11:41.672 --> 11:43.679
If you've ever cared about me ever,

11:43.713 --> 11:45.743
then go have sex on my bed...

11:50.790 --> 11:52.625
As many times as you want.

11:55.997 --> 11:57.766
How about a game, huh?

11:57.800 --> 11:59.850
Who wants to play Crazy Scabies?

12:00.800 --> 12:01.829
Floor Shorts?

12:01.985 --> 12:03.460
I guess there is enough of us,

12:03.496 --> 12:04.730
we could play Hassle the Fishmonger,

12:04.765 --> 12:06.239
but we'd have to move the couch.

12:06.240 --> 12:08.909
Yeah, no one's ever heard
of any of those games.

12:08.910 --> 12:10.929
Seriously? None of you?

12:11.657 --> 12:12.777
Well, what did you do as kids

12:12.778 --> 12:14.764
when your mom was out
with the men from the bank?

12:14.765 --> 12:17.983
Hey, guys, Kelly knows a game
that she can teach everybody.

12:19.169 --> 12:21.075
What we played at your sister's.

12:21.847 --> 12:22.923
Oh, yeah.

12:23.530 --> 12:25.448
Okay.

12:25.893 --> 12:30.076
All right, so the game
is called Answers.

12:30.077 --> 12:32.280
And you can only ask questions,

12:32.281 --> 12:34.937
or you can only reply with questions.

12:34.970 --> 12:39.179
Now, if you answer a question
or you question an answer,

12:39.180 --> 12:40.747
then you lose points.

12:40.748 --> 12:42.777
And you can only make it
to the next round

12:42.811 --> 12:45.999
once everybody has put
in their bid or an overture...

12:46.033 --> 12:46.869
You know what?

12:46.870 --> 12:49.516
Actually, we could just maybe
start playing the game,

12:49.516 --> 12:51.489
and everybody will get it as we go.

12:51.490 --> 12:54.181
I'm already annoyed.
Is that part of the game?

12:54.182 --> 12:56.652
Two points!

12:58.860 --> 13:01.041
Oh, boy, and now Elias gets three points

13:01.041 --> 13:02.550
because he located the conductor!

13:02.645 --> 13:03.529
I thought I was the conductor.

13:03.530 --> 13:05.621
No, no! Ahh! You gave it away.

13:05.621 --> 13:06.698
Oh, that was a secret?

13:06.699 --> 13:08.318
Does anyone understand this game?

13:08.319 --> 13:10.792
Two questions in a row,
I call Founder. Triple Bridge.

13:10.825 --> 13:12.246
Jerry gets it.

13:12.280 --> 13:14.304
Okay, but why am I holding
hands with Brett?

13:14.338 --> 13:16.326
I don't know.
I didn't ask you to do that.

13:16.327 --> 13:18.016
This is fun. This game is fun.

13:18.050 --> 13:20.125
This party is fun. Fun game, fun party.

13:20.159 --> 13:23.270
Fun everything! Everything is fun now.

13:23.306 --> 13:25.145
It's still fun, because
it was fun before.

13:25.180 --> 13:26.886
We could still play Floor Shorts.

13:26.920 --> 13:29.183
All I need is 14 pairs
of shorts and a 12-sided die.

13:29.216 --> 13:31.314
Okay, I came here to watch the Globes,

13:31.348 --> 13:34.397
not sit around starving in some
sad, divorced woman's house.

13:34.430 --> 13:35.693
Brett, let go of my hand!

13:35.728 --> 13:37.090
Guys, if we take off right now,

13:37.124 --> 13:38.653
we can still get spots
at the Chang's bar

13:38.687 --> 13:40.049
before the dads on dates get there.

13:40.084 --> 13:42.743
- Thank you.
- No, no, no. No, no, no, no.

13:42.777 --> 13:44.506
Emma's going to be here
in, like, five minutes.

13:44.540 --> 13:45.872
She's going to fix the TV.

13:45.908 --> 13:47.309
And also, the food's almost ready.

13:47.344 --> 13:50.045
And the food is going
to be, like, so good.

13:50.080 --> 13:51.964
Like, P.F. Chang's
"get out of here" good.

13:51.998 --> 13:53.911
Chang's level? Come on, girl.

13:53.912 --> 13:55.013
Nobody move!

13:55.702 --> 13:57.485
Sit the down!

13:57.520 --> 13:59.569
Garrett, wheel it back in!

13:59.603 --> 14:02.424
Now, we all committed
to coming here and having fun!

14:02.425 --> 14:04.495
So we are going to have fun!

14:04.530 --> 14:08.036
Stop complaining, and start
enjoying yourselves right now!

14:10.430 --> 14:11.471
It's a great time.

14:23.050 --> 14:25.343
Just go around!

14:26.950 --> 14:28.734
I'm trying to park my car.

14:30.437 --> 14:33.414
I don't even care. I didn't
want to go to the party.

14:34.256 --> 14:36.313
This is like a hostage situation.

14:36.348 --> 14:38.340
I mean, we can't leave.
They're denying us food.

14:38.374 --> 14:40.166
Not allowed to watch the Golden Globes.

14:40.200 --> 14:41.935
I hope they're done
before Emma gets here.

14:41.970 --> 14:43.916
Emma's not coming! She never was.

14:43.950 --> 14:45.334
We're on our own.

14:45.369 --> 14:47.083
Can someone please just start talking?

14:47.117 --> 14:49.509
I don't care what it is...
it could be literally anything,

14:49.510 --> 14:51.306
just as long as it's at a raised volume.

14:51.340 --> 14:52.793
That would be ideal.

14:54.480 --> 14:56.087
I met God.

14:57.610 --> 15:00.321
- Okay.
- Black guy.

15:03.520 --> 15:06.773
Okay.

15:06.808 --> 15:09.596
Okay, that looks good, right?

15:09.630 --> 15:11.646
- Oh, yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

15:11.682 --> 15:13.873
Oh, yeah.

15:15.630 --> 15:17.110
- Voilà.
- Pulls it all together.

15:17.143 --> 15:18.803
Yeah, that's what it needed.

15:23.198 --> 15:25.607
Hey, gang. With Jerusha's help,

15:25.640 --> 15:28.003
I was able to fix the broken table

15:28.040 --> 15:29.682
in, um, the bedroom there.

15:29.683 --> 15:34.057
It was broken.
It was the front left leg.

15:34.091 --> 15:35.984
Yeah. It was a two-person job,

15:36.018 --> 15:38.394
so the two... the two of us did it.

15:38.395 --> 15:39.900
We did it, together.

15:39.901 --> 15:43.686
It was a big solid oak leg.

15:45.260 --> 15:46.507
So...

15:53.570 --> 15:55.134
Father God, we thank You

15:55.170 --> 15:57.095
for this meal we're about to enjoy.

15:57.130 --> 15:59.230
We ask You to bless it with Your light.

16:00.120 --> 16:02.776
Father God, we pray that all
our efforts are rewarded

16:02.810 --> 16:07.210
and that this food replenishes
our spent and tired bodies.

16:07.792 --> 16:09.386
Amen - Amen.

16:09.420 --> 16:11.657
- Father God.
- That was beautiful, Jerusha!

16:11.690 --> 16:13.324
Yeah, nice and tight.

16:13.360 --> 16:17.527
Okay, great. Well, who is
ready for some B-B-Q?

16:17.560 --> 16:20.861
Yeah... oh.

16:20.896 --> 16:22.697
Don't be shy.
I know you guys are starving.

16:22.731 --> 16:24.464
So dig in. Garrett?

16:24.465 --> 16:27.862
Uh, what, me? Wow, thank you.

16:27.863 --> 16:30.407
Um, I am so hungry, I am.

16:30.408 --> 16:33.605
But I am going to start with the bread.

16:33.640 --> 16:38.245
- This coleslaw looks yummy.
- Yeah, coleslaw, me too!

16:38.246 --> 16:42.186
Great. Uh, meat, anyone?
Sandra, would you like a rib?

16:42.220 --> 16:44.470
Um, brisket? Some...
bawk-bawk... chicken?

16:44.505 --> 16:47.023
I filled up on water before I came.

16:47.059 --> 16:48.737
Ugh, always do that.

16:48.771 --> 16:50.350
Well, I can't wait,

16:50.385 --> 16:53.878
because this is the best sauce
in all of St. Louis.

16:53.913 --> 16:57.164
I was surprised they had any,
usually they're sold out, so...

16:57.826 --> 16:58.926
Mmm!

17:01.070 --> 17:02.582
That sauce is...

17:04.160 --> 17:06.561
The more you chew, the better it is.

17:07.923 --> 17:09.575
Anybody want any meat?

17:10.242 --> 17:12.819
Nobody? Really? Nobody?

17:12.819 --> 17:14.227
Nobody wants meat?

17:15.240 --> 17:16.204
I'll take some.

17:16.321 --> 17:17.079
Aren't you vegan?

17:17.167 --> 17:19.314
Uh, yeah, just for, like, 20 years.

17:19.444 --> 17:22.270
But when I see meat
that looks that delicious,

17:22.589 --> 17:24.259
I have to make an exception.

17:24.260 --> 17:26.259
No, Dina, you don't have to eat that.

17:26.260 --> 17:28.680
- Ugh.
- Oh, yeah.

17:28.714 --> 17:30.531
I guess this is what
he used to stand on.

17:30.564 --> 17:32.581
They just took off the little foot.

17:33.513 --> 17:35.120
I'm going to eat a bird now.

17:36.180 --> 17:37.852
I'm going to eat a bird now.

17:39.880 --> 17:40.867
I'm gonna...

17:43.750 --> 17:47.342
Wow, but is it worth it for that taste!

17:47.344 --> 17:51.231
Yum!

17:51.481 --> 17:53.637
Dina?

17:53.650 --> 17:56.795
- Are you okay in there?
- I'm fine!

17:57.175 --> 18:00.947
Just, um, save some of that sinewy meat,

18:01.400 --> 18:03.788
'cause I'm going to want round two.

18:05.370 --> 18:09.505
Guys, look,
this party is a bust.

18:09.540 --> 18:13.466
You guys were right.
My... my life is... is in shambles.

18:13.500 --> 18:15.251
Aw, sweetie.

18:15.627 --> 18:16.469
Of course it is.

18:16.597 --> 18:18.757
Hey, come on, y-you're overreacting.

18:18.790 --> 18:21.066
So dinner was a little messed up,

18:21.119 --> 18:22.549
and the TV doesn't work.

18:22.550 --> 18:24.649
At a party where the two
things you're supposed to do

18:24.690 --> 18:26.057
is eat dinner and watch TV.

18:26.091 --> 18:27.491
Okay, yeah, but, you know,

18:27.526 --> 18:30.485
it's not like somebody
died or something.

18:30.486 --> 18:32.498
That's how you judge
the success of a party...

18:32.499 --> 18:33.498
no fatalities.

18:33.533 --> 18:36.134
Two people died at my prom.
We had it on a boat.

18:36.169 --> 18:37.636
It was really sad.

18:37.670 --> 18:39.601
And yet you kept the dress.

18:40.700 --> 18:42.406
Just give yourself a break.

18:42.407 --> 18:44.829
You've never been on your own before.

18:44.863 --> 18:46.761
It takes some getting used to.

18:46.796 --> 18:47.875
Yeah, it's like,

18:47.876 --> 18:50.160
Jerry basically had
to relearn everything.

18:50.194 --> 18:52.298
He thought it would
never get any better,

18:52.299 --> 18:55.557
but he already knows the
difference between wet and dry.

18:55.592 --> 18:58.089
See? You're going
to be just fine.

18:58.123 --> 19:00.487
A woman from my church got divorced

19:00.522 --> 19:02.453
because she married a man from Facebook.

19:02.487 --> 19:04.933
It turns out he was already married

19:04.934 --> 19:08.116
to several other women
and one man from Singapore.

19:08.151 --> 19:10.149
Took all her money.
It was on "Dateline."

19:10.182 --> 19:12.913
At least you're not on "Dateline."

19:12.948 --> 19:14.246
Yeah.

19:14.280 --> 19:15.312
Hey, Amy.

19:15.963 --> 19:18.643
I'd say something supportive
'cause you're my friend,

19:18.678 --> 19:19.976
but that's not what I do.

19:20.010 --> 19:21.205
I understand.

19:22.650 --> 19:24.884
- Bye.
- Bye.

19:24.918 --> 19:27.319
- Sorry about the... everything.
- It's...

19:27.353 --> 19:28.887
Thank you for having us.

19:28.921 --> 19:30.455
We're going to wash your sheets.

19:30.490 --> 19:33.057
It's just something
we like to do after parties.

19:33.091 --> 19:35.059
Keep them.

19:35.093 --> 19:37.961
Do you want to go to Chang's?

19:37.995 --> 19:39.663
We can watch the losers
give drunken interviews

19:39.697 --> 19:40.730
at the after-parties.

19:40.765 --> 19:42.647
Mm. Want to come?

19:43.533 --> 19:45.323
Kelly, you want to come?

19:46.736 --> 19:48.903
Oh, I thought you were... Am I invited?

19:48.937 --> 19:52.373
Yeah, that's why I said,
"Kelly, you want to come?"

19:52.408 --> 19:54.908
I would love that. Thanks.

19:55.710 --> 19:57.313
Uh, hey...

19:57.350 --> 19:59.178
You guys want
to hit up Chang's?

19:59.212 --> 20:01.572
The whole gang's going.
You feel like coming?

20:05.164 --> 20:08.920
Oh, um, no, I-I got
a lot of meat to eat,

20:08.955 --> 20:11.813
and, I, um... I got to clean up and...

20:11.848 --> 20:13.276
- You sure?
- Yeah.

20:13.311 --> 20:16.635
Um, pro tip... throw the microwave away.

20:16.670 --> 20:20.094
Yeah, I'm thinking
I'm just going to move.

20:20.128 --> 20:22.920
We should do this more often.

20:22.954 --> 20:25.846
Yeah, next weekend, same chicken.

20:25.880 --> 20:27.675
- Hey.
- Hi.

20:27.710 --> 20:30.576
Garrett was like, "Kelly, you coming?"

20:30.610 --> 20:35.416
Oh, see? Scrappy Doo!

20:35.450 --> 20:40.887

20:40.920 --> 20:44.680

20:49.022 --> 20:50.473

20:50.507 --> 20:52.023

20:55.872 --> 20:57.895
- Hey, you're still here.
- Yeah.

20:57.928 --> 20:59.334
Did you take a shower?

20:59.335 --> 21:02.150
Oh, trust me, you would not
have wanted me to take a bath.

21:02.183 --> 21:03.771
<i>With some people tweeting # Racist.</i>

21:03.778 --> 21:06.973
Hey, you fixed it! Look who's
crawling out of rock bottom.

21:07.000 --> 21:09.256
<i>Let's see what she has to say
about taking home a trophy.</i>

21:09.257 --> 21:11.670
Hey, thank you for trying to help me.

21:12.363 --> 21:13.170
It's what I do.

21:14.058 --> 21:16.120
<i>How did it feel to be up
on that stage there tonight?</i>

21:16.121 --> 21:19.566
I'm going to need

21:19.600 --> 21:22.139
also some tops.
