Oh, thanks, Crick.

01:31.208 --> 01:33.708
This will look so cool in my nest.

01:33.791 --> 01:35.666
No problem, Blackbird.

01:35.750 --> 01:41.041
After Christmastime,
we always find amazing things.

01:43.583 --> 01:45.375
Oh, my. Look at me.

01:45.458 --> 01:47.875
I'm one of the Three Slugateers.

01:47.958 --> 01:50.333
En garde. Ooh!

01:52.125 --> 01:56.041
Everyone else is finding beautiful stuff
except me.

01:56.916 --> 01:58.208
Keep looking, Walter.

01:58.291 --> 02:03.000
-You'll find something.
-Hey, check out the awesome stuff we got.

02:03.083 --> 02:05.250
The stickiest sticks ever.

02:05.333 --> 02:07.791
And the yummiest.

02:08.333 --> 02:09.333
Mm!

02:10.625 --> 02:12.541
Oh, my belly-ness.

02:12.625 --> 02:14.958
You have to see this.

02:17.375 --> 02:19.125
Ta-da! Ha-ha-ha.

02:19.208 --> 02:22.458
The perfect outfit
for the annual bug parade.

02:26.000 --> 02:28.750
What is this thingy?

02:28.833 --> 02:35.083
Technically, it's not so much
a thingy as a... ooh, onion.

02:35.166 --> 02:37.541
It's a kind of a food.

02:37.625 --> 02:39.916
Do you hear that squish?

02:48.166 --> 02:50.583
Get it off. Get it off.

02:50.666 --> 02:52.958
It's making me cry.

02:53.041 --> 02:54.666
Surprisingly.

02:54.750 --> 02:56.458
Yuck!

02:57.458 --> 03:00.375
Water. Get me water.

03:07.708 --> 03:09.291
Ooh! Look.

03:09.375 --> 03:12.875
Something so sparkly.
Surely that has to be treasure.

03:12.958 --> 03:15.833
Yay! Yay! Yay!

03:22.916 --> 03:23.916
Whoa.

03:26.666 --> 03:28.083
Amazing.

03:29.833 --> 03:32.708
Aah! It's alive.

03:32.791 --> 03:37.416
By my observations,
that's simply your, um, reflection.

03:39.416 --> 03:40.250
Hmm.

03:40.333 --> 03:46.583
-Actually, it's my reflection.
-Actually, it's my reflection.

03:46.666 --> 03:48.208
See?

03:50.875 --> 03:52.541
-Look out.
-Aah!

04:03.541 --> 04:04.791
Waa!

04:04.875 --> 04:06.875
So beautiful.

04:06.958 --> 04:07.958
Can we keep it?

04:08.041 --> 04:09.708
Can we? Can we? Can we?

04:09.791 --> 04:12.666
-Yeah.
-Oh, yeah.

04:18.708 --> 04:20.583
Oh, my.

04:20.666 --> 04:23.666
It's magnificent. It's inspiring.

04:23.750 --> 04:24.833
It's...

04:24.916 --> 04:28.833
-What is it?
-A priceless treasure.

04:28.916 --> 04:31.625
And guess who found it.
Here's a clue.

04:31.708 --> 04:35.583
-Me.
-It's a bubble with me reflectioned in it.

04:35.666 --> 04:38.875
I think it's a, uh, tree egg.

04:38.958 --> 04:42.416
Trees don't usually lay eggs.

04:42.500 --> 04:45.958
Uh, I... I know what it is.

04:46.041 --> 04:49.875
It's... It's an onion.

04:49.958 --> 04:51.875
A glass onion.

04:52.083 --> 04:56.000
Aah! Yes. A magical glass onion.

04:56.083 --> 05:00.083
The most-est magical-est ever-er.

05:00.916 --> 05:06.083
I've never seen anything
so... amazing and so beautiful.

05:06.166 --> 05:09.833
Where on earth did you find it, dears?

05:09.916 --> 05:13.125

Oh, yes, I can see it now.

06:10.916 --> 06:13.000
Thank you. Thank you.

06:13.083 --> 06:15.833
No, please. Don't stop.

06:17.166 --> 06:20.750
It will be so magnificent.

06:20.833 --> 06:24.333
Hey. How come you get to decide
what we do with it?

06:24.416 --> 06:26.916
Because I'm the one who found it.

06:27.000 --> 06:33.750
But I'm the one who got it out of the tree
and I've got a way better idea.

06:33.833 --> 06:36.750
I'd make it an amazing ride.

06:36.833 --> 06:40.916
We'd call it's Jay's Wild Water Walker.

06:42.625 --> 06:45.291
Well, that's interesting,

06:45.375 --> 06:49.625
but I had a more scien-crific plan
in mind.

06:49.708 --> 06:55.041
We can use it
for underwater explor-ification,

06:55.125 --> 06:59.833
and call it the Crickto-marine.

06:59.916 --> 07:01.500
Crickto-what?

07:01.583 --> 07:06.208
Jay's Wild Water Walker is way catchier.

07:06.291 --> 07:10.833
But a Crickto-marine would be
of far more value to science.

07:10.916 --> 07:15.416
Hello. I found it.
And I want it to be a parade float.

07:15.500 --> 07:18.708
-Anything else would be a hideous waste.
-Hey, bugs, calm down.

07:18.791 --> 07:21.041
It's so beautiful,
why can't we all share it?

07:21.125 --> 07:24.375
Let's put it somewhere safe
where everyone can see it,

07:24.458 --> 07:27.750
like, for instance, my house.

07:27.833 --> 07:29.750
It would look awesome there

07:29.833 --> 07:33.625
and everyone
would be so welcome to come and see it.

07:33.708 --> 07:38.416
Sorry, visitors stay
behind the rope, please.

07:39.875 --> 07:43.041
I don't understand.
Why should it stay at your house?

07:43.125 --> 07:44.708
Well, it has to stay somewhere.

07:44.791 --> 07:48.833
But by my calculations,
that isn't sharing at all.

07:48.916 --> 07:51.916
The case for keeping it
at my house is multi-layered...

07:52.000 --> 07:55.000
This arguing makes my head hurt.

07:55.083 --> 07:57.208
Whoa!

07:58.833 --> 07:59.875
Oh, no.

07:59.958 --> 08:01.458
Bugs. Look.

08:01.541 --> 08:03.375
The onion.

08:14.291 --> 08:15.625
Whoa.

08:16.958 --> 08:19.125
Are you okay, little Buzz?

08:20.125 --> 08:22.750
Uh-- I think so.

08:22.833 --> 08:26.333
-You really scared us, Buzz.
-Everyone,

08:26.416 --> 08:28.583
I have an idea.

08:28.666 --> 08:31.083
Why don't we let Buzz decide

08:31.166 --> 08:34.457
what the best plan is,
for the onion, I mean.

08:34.541 --> 08:35.916
That's a great idea, Crick.

08:38.416 --> 08:40.000
-Okay.
-Yeah, I guess so.

08:40.082 --> 08:43.082
So, which plan do you like, Buzz?

08:43.166 --> 08:45.416
Um, um...

08:45.500 --> 08:47.416
Well, I think... I think...

08:48.750 --> 08:49.666
Well...

08:51.625 --> 08:53.625
How do I choose?

08:53.708 --> 08:57.916
Whoever I don't pick
will be disappoint-erated.

08:58.000 --> 08:59.166
Hurry up, Buzz.

08:59.250 --> 09:02.500
The suspense
is making my squish go trembly.

09:03.958 --> 09:06.708
Maybe you could give Buzz more time.

09:06.791 --> 09:08.791
-Can she tell you tomorrow?
-Yes.

09:08.875 --> 09:09.916
Tomorrow.

09:10.000 --> 09:14.333
-I guess it is getting late.
-But how will I ever sleep not knowing?

09:14.416 --> 09:16.541
Oh, chillax, Walter.

09:16.625 --> 09:17.916
Come on.

09:18.000 --> 09:21.208
-See you later.
-Bye, see you tomorrow.

09:21.291 --> 09:24.541
Um, how will I choose tomorrow?

09:24.625 --> 09:27.750
Let's just see what the morning brings,
Buzz.

09:37.208 --> 09:38.500
It's gone.

09:38.583 --> 09:41.041
The onni-onion is gone.

09:41.125 --> 09:44.416
Gone? But who took it?

09:45.041 --> 09:47.166
Oh, don't look at me.

09:47.250 --> 09:51.125
-Walter?
-How dare you even suggest that?

09:51.208 --> 09:53.166
It's probably in Kumi's house.

09:53.916 --> 09:57.625
-No way. I wouldn't take it.
-What's this?

09:59.375 --> 10:01.125
Blackbird.

10:05.750 --> 10:06.750
Oh, dear.

10:06.833 --> 10:08.875
It's in her nest.

10:08.958 --> 10:10.958
But why would Blackbird take it?

10:11.041 --> 10:13.375
We have to get it back.

10:14.625 --> 10:15.833
I know.

10:15.916 --> 10:19.791
Whoever gets to the onion first
gets to do their plan.

10:19.875 --> 10:22.208
-Wait. What?
-Awesome.

10:31.708 --> 10:35.208
-Let it go. I won.
-No, you didn't.

10:35.291 --> 10:39.958
-I did.
-By my calculations, it was me.

10:41.833 --> 10:46.375
-Blackbird, why'd you take the onion?
-Yes. Why?

10:48.083 --> 10:50.708
I hated seeing you all arguing over it.

10:50.791 --> 10:53.416
It was like you'd forgotten
you were all friends.

10:54.583 --> 10:58.916
You're so right
and yet everyone knows it's mine.

10:59.000 --> 11:01.583
-Walter.
-No, it isn't.

11:01.666 --> 11:04.041
Bugs. Be friends. Be friends.

11:04.125 --> 11:08.125
-This is just unbelievable.
-Don't you dare.

11:14.875 --> 11:16.916
Smashee.

11:18.083 --> 11:21.250
Bye-bye, special bubble.

11:21.333 --> 11:24.666
Bye-bye, parade float.

11:24.750 --> 11:30.041
-Now it's no use to anyone.
-And it's all our fault.

11:30.125 --> 11:31.125
Yes.

11:31.208 --> 11:36.416
My dears, I think I might still be able
to do something with it,

11:36.500 --> 11:38.083
but you'll all need to help.

11:45.083 --> 11:46.791
-Awesome.
-Amazing.

11:48.791 --> 11:50.416
It is awesome.

11:50.500 --> 11:53.000

Wow. Something sure put the gloom
in his glow worm.

13:13.500 --> 13:16.208
Never mind him.
Wait till you see what I ordered.

13:16.291 --> 13:19.708
It's a cool new baseball cap. See? Huh?

13:20.291 --> 13:23.625
This isn't a new baseball cap.
They're bottle caps.

13:24.666 --> 13:27.625

not serving ladles.

-This is not the sunbrella I ordered.

13:40.791 --> 13:43.916
Postman Bee messed up the packages.

13:44.000 --> 13:45.833
But that never happens.

13:45.916 --> 13:47.416
Never, ever.

13:47.500 --> 13:48.875

-Negatory, Walter.

14:53.041 --> 14:56.583
My granny's memory
has begun to fade.

14:56.666 --> 14:59.041
Did you know she used to be a famous chef?

14:59.125 --> 15:00.458
Really?

15:00.541 --> 15:04.458
You mean, like, famously famous? Ha-ha-ha.

15:04.541 --> 15:07.333
You have to tell me everything.

15:07.416 --> 15:09.375
Everyone knew her name.

15:09.458 --> 15:13.125
She even had her own cooking show.

15:14.125 --> 15:16.375
Today we're making honey pie,

15:16.458 --> 15:20.041
so, straighten those aprons
and spin those pins

15:20.125 --> 15:26.958
because for goodness sake,
it's time to bake.

15:27.041 --> 15:33.125
But as famous as my granny became,
she never forgot about me.

15:33.333 --> 15:36.291
We'd have lunch together every Saturday,

15:36.375 --> 15:39.041
and I'd tell her everything
that happened during the week.

15:39.125 --> 15:43.125
Then, we'd finish
with our favorite dessert, honey pie.

15:47.583 --> 15:51.666
But these days, Granny can't remember
the recipe for honey pie.

15:51.750 --> 15:54.875
I wish I'd learned it,
so I could make it for her now.

15:54.958 --> 15:56.750
Lunch is ready, dear.

15:56.833 --> 16:00.041
For dessert, I made a...

16:01.250 --> 16:03.500
um, honey pie.

16:03.583 --> 16:06.250
It's your favorite, isn't it?

16:06.333 --> 16:08.375
Sure is. Mm, mm.

16:08.458 --> 16:13.166
That pie looks good enough to... eat.

16:18.583 --> 16:23.083
Don't worry, Postman Bee,
there must be something...

16:23.166 --> 16:25.416
that we can do to help.

16:25.500 --> 16:28.125
Yes. Let's be helpies.

16:28.208 --> 16:31.666
Well, we could make a whole batch
of honey pies

16:31.750 --> 16:35.041
using different ingredients
until we find the right recipe?

16:35.125 --> 16:39.208
Or we could build a Crickto-crank
Memory Yank Machine

16:39.291 --> 16:42.458
and pull the recipe out of Granny's head.

16:42.541 --> 16:45.208
We can't bring the recipe back to Granny,

16:45.291 --> 16:48.750
so, let's bring old Granny
back to the recipe.

16:48.833 --> 16:51.000
We'll redo her old cooking show,

16:51.083 --> 16:54.875
so, she feels like a star again.
Bet you that makes her remember.

16:54.958 --> 16:59.250
Jay. That's a mar-belly-ous idea.

16:59.333 --> 17:02.083
I added some...

17:02.958 --> 17:04.790
What did I add?

17:04.875 --> 17:08.333
Oh, yes, uh, some nettle?

17:09.415 --> 17:12.625
Maybe that will help it taste right.

17:13.333 --> 17:17.415
I'm sure it will be, um, delicious.

17:17.500 --> 17:19.665
Over here, Granny Bee. Smile.

17:19.750 --> 17:22.665
Granny Bee.
Can we have your autograph?

17:22.750 --> 17:25.915
Time to go, GB.
Everyone's ready for you.

17:26.790 --> 17:28.540
Ready for me?

17:28.625 --> 17:33.041
Uh-huh. You can't be late
for your own cooking show.

17:45.875 --> 17:48.583
Welcome to our red carpet event.

17:48.666 --> 17:49.916
Love the hair.

17:50.708 --> 17:53.833
Who are you wearing today, Granny Bee?

17:58.250 --> 17:59.458
And we're on.

17:59.541 --> 18:01.875
In three, two, one.

18:04.750 --> 18:08.833
From beautiful Downtown Village Green,

18:08.916 --> 18:12.958
it's time for Baking with Granny.

18:14.916 --> 18:15.916
Um...

18:16.208 --> 18:19.083
Today we're making...

18:19.166 --> 18:20.000
um...

18:21.666 --> 18:22.625
Honey pie.

18:22.708 --> 18:24.458
Moving in for a close-up.

18:24.541 --> 18:26.958
I'm not sure what to do.

18:27.041 --> 18:30.791
Well, do you want to mix the honey
with strawberry syrup?

18:30.875 --> 18:35.166
-Or maybe rose petal puree?
-When do we get to eat?

18:35.250 --> 18:38.708
-How about we add slug sauce to the flour?
-When do we get to eat?

18:38.791 --> 18:41.750
If we mix water with the honey,
do we call it runny pie?

18:41.833 --> 18:43.333
When do we get to eat?

18:43.416 --> 18:48.875
Uh, we'll start by, uh,
rolling out the dough.

18:48.958 --> 18:49.875
Roll the dough.

18:49.958 --> 18:52.375
You got it, Granny.

18:53.875 --> 18:56.666
I-- I don't know what to do.

18:56.750 --> 18:59.708
I can't remember.

19:01.333 --> 19:05.625
Bugs. I appreciate what you're
trying to do, but mission fail.

19:05.708 --> 19:06.625
Terminate plan.

19:06.708 --> 19:08.041
Granny, we should...

19:15.500 --> 19:18.666
Oh! Think honey's funny, huh?

19:18.750 --> 19:20.875
Ah!

19:24.083 --> 19:25.333
Ugh!

19:29.166 --> 19:31.208
Food fight.

19:37.208 --> 19:39.375
Now, now, everyone.

19:39.458 --> 19:42.208
So, that's how you want to play?

19:42.291 --> 19:44.958
Begin Operation Toss and Slosh.

20:06.500 --> 20:08.625
Oh, no.

20:15.958 --> 20:16.833
Granny,

20:16.916 --> 20:19.416
I am so sorry.

20:22.958 --> 20:28.458
You know, that tastes very familiar.

20:28.541 --> 20:32.583
Almost like one of my
old-fashioned honey pies.

20:32.666 --> 20:39.291
It just needs more cinnamon
and maybe a dash of... Is it molasses?

20:39.375 --> 20:40.416
Yes.

20:40.500 --> 20:42.041
I remember.

20:43.791 --> 20:48.791
For goodness sake, it's time to bake.

20:51.375 --> 20:53.041
This is no time to be lazy.

20:53.125 --> 20:55.916
Sonny, roll out that dough.

20:56.000 --> 20:58.541
Jay, shape it into the pan.

20:58.625 --> 21:00.875
