WEBVTT

00:02.878 --> 00:05.301
Air and naval forces
of the United States...

00:05.380 --> 00:08.007
launched a series of strikes
against terrorist facilities-

00:08.090 --> 00:10.935
Pan Am Flight 103 crashed
into the town of Lockerbie.

00:11.011 --> 00:13.730
He has sanctioned acts of terror
in Africa, Europe and the Middle East.

00:13.805 --> 00:16.900
This will not stand,
this aggression against Kuwait.

00:16.975 --> 00:18.443
...his relentless pursuit of terror.

00:18.519 --> 00:20.237
We will make no distinction-

00:20.312 --> 00:22.872
The U.S.S. Cole was attacked
while refueling in the port of Aden-

00:22.940 --> 00:24.817
This was an act of terrorism.

00:24.900 --> 00:28.404
It was a despicable and cowardly act.

00:28.487 --> 00:30.865
The next number we're gonna swing for you
is one of the good ol' favorites.

00:30.948 --> 00:33.417
...until something stops him.

00:33.492 --> 00:36.245
I'm just making sure
we don't get hit again.

00:38.455 --> 00:41.049
We got a plane crashed
into the World Trade Center.

00:42.334 --> 00:43.961
...thousands of people running-

00:44.044 --> 00:47.969
We must, and we will,
remain vigilant at home and abroad.

00:53.887 --> 00:55.514
What the fuck are you doing?

00:58.141 --> 01:00.018
Fuck! I missed something once before.

01:00.102 --> 01:03.151
I won't-/ can't let that happen again.

01:05.315 --> 01:07.909
It was 10 years ago.
Everyone missed something that day.

01:07.985 --> 01:10.659
Yeah, everyone is not me.

01:10.737 --> 01:12.058
Once you've got to this position.

01:20.205 --> 01:22.207
Previously on Homeland.

01:22.291 --> 01:24.794
We hit someone with your car.

01:24.876 --> 01:26.674
She died in the middle of the night.

01:26.753 --> 01:29.597
- We have to tell someone.
- No, we don't. We agreed to stay quiet.

01:29.673 --> 01:32.176
It's even more important now.

01:32.259 --> 01:35.604
I got a line on a terrorist.
I can get her to talk.

01:35.679 --> 01:37.773
- Hi, Aileen.
- Who are you?

01:37.848 --> 01:39.521
Your ride.

01:41.768 --> 01:44.146
What is the target?

01:44.229 --> 01:45.856
I don't know.

01:48.275 --> 01:50.494
What the fuck is the matter with you?

01:50.569 --> 01:53.243
- This is my interrogation!
- Get him out of here.

01:54.531 --> 01:58.786
I can do this, Saul. it's my turn.

01:58.869 --> 02:00.837
What is Abu Nazir's plan?

02:00.912 --> 02:02.289
I don't know.

02:02.372 --> 02:04.670
But there is a plan?

02:04.750 --> 02:06.377
Yes.

02:07.502 --> 02:09.550
Who does know the plan?

02:09.630 --> 02:12.474
I'm a friend... of Nazir's.

02:12.549 --> 02:14.927
This is it.
This is the meet we've been waiting for.

02:15.010 --> 02:17.729
That's him. Without the sunglasses.

02:19.181 --> 02:22.435
The tailor in Gettysburg-he's dead.

02:22.517 --> 02:25.896
He handled their munitions. if this new guy
turns out to be his replacement...

02:25.979 --> 02:27.356
we need a line on him fast.

02:27.439 --> 02:30.238
I'll put a forensics team together
and take 'em to Gettysburg.

03:12.567 --> 03:15.036
- You heard about Gettysburg?
- Heard about it?

03:15.112 --> 03:17.114
It's all over the fucking news.

03:17.197 --> 03:19.620
Was that really necessary?

03:19.700 --> 03:21.498
We got what we needed.
That's the important thing.

03:21.576 --> 03:23.499
- Which is what?
- But we lost a man.

03:23.578 --> 03:26.422
You're going to have to
play a larger role now.

03:26.498 --> 03:29.217
Yeah? Like what? How about some details?

03:29.292 --> 03:30.885
Not possible.

03:30.961 --> 03:33.805
That's not good enough, Roya.

03:33.880 --> 03:36.474
That's how it's always been.
What's different now?

03:36.550 --> 03:40.350
Six federal agents are dead.
You can't expect business as usual.

03:40.429 --> 03:43.524
It is what it is, and things are
going to move very quickly now.

03:43.598 --> 03:45.942
Oh, like a day? A week?

03:46.017 --> 03:48.236
I need you to meet with someone.

03:48.311 --> 03:49.904
Who?

03:49.980 --> 03:53.610
I'll let you know the how and where
as soon as I can.

03:53.692 --> 03:56.411
I gotta tell you, Roya, I don't like this.

03:56.486 --> 03:59.956
You don't have to like it,
but this is no time to buckle.

04:00.031 --> 04:01.908
We're almost there.

04:01.992 --> 04:05.747
Meanwhile, this weekend,
you're at a Walden fund-raiser, right?

04:05.829 --> 04:07.797
- Yeah.
- Keep him happy.

04:07.873 --> 04:09.500
I always do.

04:09.583 --> 04:11.130
Keep him very happy.

04:26.016 --> 04:27.643
This one's a piece of work.

04:27.726 --> 04:30.946
A spitter, a hitter and a shitter.

04:31.021 --> 04:33.115
That doesn't sound like her.

04:33.190 --> 04:35.238
Then you don't know her too well.

04:48.538 --> 04:51.792
BA-54, open, please.

05:02.219 --> 05:03.721
Aileen?

05:06.389 --> 05:08.391
It's Saul Berenson.

05:12.312 --> 05:14.861
We drove from Mexico to D.C. together.

05:18.068 --> 05:21.072
I said I might be back if I needed help.

05:24.241 --> 05:27.541
Can we talk about this upstairs?

05:28.912 --> 05:30.414
What's wrong with here?

05:32.374 --> 05:34.422
Everything.

05:35.085 --> 05:37.008
It's very urgent.

06:25.260 --> 06:27.388
You ever get outside?

06:31.641 --> 06:34.895
Twenty-three hours in the cell.

06:34.978 --> 06:39.154
One hour to walk around-go to that
crappy library, that kind of thing.

06:40.942 --> 06:42.319
Yeah.

06:42.402 --> 06:46.032
My eyes are shot though.
I don't even read anymore.

06:47.991 --> 06:50.665
Look at that light. Isn't it nice?

06:54.789 --> 06:56.666
I need help, Aileen.

06:58.668 --> 07:02.218
- We're on a tight timetable.
- You said.

07:10.513 --> 07:12.515
You know who this is?

07:17.228 --> 07:18.730
Yeah, I know him.

07:18.813 --> 07:20.315
Who is he?

07:24.653 --> 07:27.657
Name, address-anything.

07:29.240 --> 07:31.618
I tell you, you get what you need...

07:31.701 --> 07:34.705
and I get shoved back into that cell.

07:34.788 --> 07:37.632
- Well, maybe I can talk to the warden.
- He's sadistic.

07:37.707 --> 07:40.381
- Well, they say that about every warden.
- For a reason.

07:41.670 --> 07:44.674
- Time is of the essence here.
- Not for me.

07:48.093 --> 07:49.265
Okay.

07:50.387 --> 07:52.685
What do you want?

07:52.764 --> 07:56.769
Keeping in mind there's only so much
I can do for a confessed terrorist.

07:57.394 --> 08:00.113
A window.

08:00.188 --> 08:02.236
A cell with a view.

08:02.315 --> 08:04.864
- I can get that.
- How do you know?

08:04.943 --> 08:08.368
Can you trust me that I
can get that for you...

08:08.446 --> 08:10.244
and help me now?

08:10.949 --> 08:12.792
I don't trust anyone.

08:17.038 --> 08:18.836
Okay.

08:18.915 --> 08:20.588
I'll be back.

08:21.751 --> 08:23.753
On the gate.

08:36.599 --> 08:39.022
Why does Roya care so much about Walden?

08:39.102 --> 08:42.072
- Maybe he's the target.
- Again?

08:42.147 --> 08:44.570
Well, the World Trade
Center was hit in '93...

08:44.649 --> 08:47.448
and was the target again
more recently, you may recall.

08:50.989 --> 08:53.242
You see Galvez?

08:53.324 --> 08:54.917
Yeah.

08:55.618 --> 08:57.495
It doesn't look good.

08:57.579 --> 08:59.206
Oh, shit.

08:59.289 --> 09:02.259
They told his parents to come.

09:05.295 --> 09:07.218
You get any word back from the lab?

09:07.297 --> 09:10.096
The good news is there were no radioactive
contaminants in the shop.

09:10.175 --> 09:11.677
So it's not a dirty bomb.

09:11.760 --> 09:13.387
But judging by the R.D.X. residue...

09:13.470 --> 09:16.269
and the fact that it took two guys
to move that thing...

09:16.347 --> 09:19.942
they've got enough C-4 to level an embassy,
a synagogue.

09:20.018 --> 09:21.736
And they're in the wind.

09:21.811 --> 09:23.279
Yeah.

09:28.985 --> 09:30.953
I got to get out of this dress.

09:31.029 --> 09:33.248
They're not discharging you.

09:33.323 --> 09:35.325
I'm discharging me.

09:40.705 --> 09:42.252
Where's Saul?

09:42.332 --> 09:45.632
He went to the supermax
in Waynesburg to see Aileen.

09:45.710 --> 09:50.841
That's our big move-rattle a chick
who's been locked up for months.

09:50.924 --> 09:53.473
It's a Hail Mary.

09:53.551 --> 09:56.054
Quinn! Right in front of me?

09:57.138 --> 09:59.311
Like you've never seen a dick before.

10:14.697 --> 10:17.621
- You gonna ride a horse?
- I don't know.

10:17.700 --> 10:19.794
'Cause you can break your neck on a horse.

10:36.386 --> 10:38.354
Finn.

10:39.055 --> 10:40.853
I went to her funeral.

10:42.725 --> 10:44.978
They passed around this collection plate...

10:45.061 --> 10:48.782
and there were, like, $12.

10:52.360 --> 10:53.907
Wanna send money or something?

10:56.906 --> 10:59.079
I wanna tell.

10:59.159 --> 11:00.581
Tell who?

11:00.660 --> 11:02.333
Our parents, the cops.

11:02.412 --> 11:04.460
And, uh...

11:04.539 --> 11:06.337
what will that achieve?

11:07.250 --> 11:08.843
It's the right thing to do.

11:08.918 --> 11:12.013
- I know. I'm not a sociopath here, okay?
- Then let's do it together.

11:12.088 --> 11:14.637
If we were normal people
with normal parents, we would.

11:14.716 --> 11:16.844
But what, we're special?

11:16.926 --> 11:18.894
- My dad-
- What?

11:19.888 --> 11:21.936
It's bad enough with him.

11:25.268 --> 11:27.646
I'm sorry, but if you're
not gonna do this with me...

11:27.729 --> 11:29.777
I have to do it by myself.

11:43.703 --> 11:46.331
- Okay.
- Okay what?

11:48.458 --> 11:50.335
Okay, we'll tell.

12:01.137 --> 12:03.731
Will Senator Laughton be there?

12:03.806 --> 12:06.400
Laughton's fading.

12:06.476 --> 12:08.570
Avery Phillips is the new contender.

12:08.645 --> 12:11.148
A woman. Interesting.

12:11.231 --> 12:14.656
Yeah. Yeah, Walden's playing the field.

12:14.734 --> 12:17.112
You're still the front-runner.

12:17.195 --> 12:18.447
Yeah.

12:22.659 --> 12:24.661
So Mike was over the other night.

12:25.703 --> 12:27.546
Who told you that?

12:27.622 --> 12:28.919
Chris.

12:32.835 --> 12:35.258
He told me something upsetting.

12:35.338 --> 12:38.217
- About you.
- Why am I not surprised?

12:39.050 --> 12:40.802
He told me you killed Tom.

12:47.684 --> 12:49.231
You believe him?

12:49.310 --> 12:53.190
I can take it if it's the truth,
but I can't take another lie.

13:04.367 --> 13:07.837
The C.I.A. knew we were close...

13:07.912 --> 13:10.711
and they used me to reach him.

13:12.709 --> 13:15.178
And then it got messy.

13:15.253 --> 13:17.881
- Like how?
- Like dangerous.

13:20.383 --> 13:21.384
Yeah, I-

13:23.011 --> 13:26.857
I did have a part in-in stopping him.

13:26.931 --> 13:29.400
What the fuck, Brody?

13:29.475 --> 13:33.025
I know.

13:33.896 --> 13:35.398
But, look...

13:35.481 --> 13:38.781
Tom lost his way.

13:38.860 --> 13:40.157
He just-

13:40.236 --> 13:42.159
He just went through too many things...

13:42.238 --> 13:44.707
and he-he couldn't get right again.

13:55.918 --> 13:57.920
It looks like we're here.

14:12.769 --> 14:14.771
It's about time you visited, Billy.

14:14.854 --> 14:17.778
- You been busy or something?
- Just waiting for an invite, Rex.

14:17.857 --> 14:20.701
Door's always open.
You know that. Ah, Cynthia.

14:20.777 --> 14:22.154
Hi there, Rex.

14:23.279 --> 14:26.032
You still look like a Tri Delt.

14:26.115 --> 14:27.287
Okay, that's enough.

14:28.785 --> 14:30.753
So...

14:30.828 --> 14:32.296
when?

14:34.749 --> 14:36.626
Let's do it later.

14:38.336 --> 14:39.963
Today though.

14:40.046 --> 14:42.265
Yeah, yeah.

14:42.340 --> 14:44.138
Sometime today.

14:45.843 --> 14:47.891
Nick Brody. Rex Henning...

14:47.970 --> 14:49.571
- owner of this little dacha.
- Pleasure.

14:49.597 --> 14:51.440
- It's beautiful.
- Oh, thank you very much.

14:51.516 --> 14:54.770
- You had a bar fight?
- Home improvements.

14:56.104 --> 14:58.448
- This is my wife, Jessica.
- Jessica, welcome.

14:58.523 --> 15:00.617
- Nice to meet you. Pleasure.
- Thank you.

15:00.691 --> 15:04.116
- Nick, I've been looking forward to meeting you.
- Thank you.

15:04.195 --> 15:06.789
Let's get inside and have some lemonade...

15:06.864 --> 15:08.616
raise some money.

15:11.077 --> 15:13.796
I'll meet you inside.

15:29.387 --> 15:30.730
Hi, Brody.

15:30.805 --> 15:32.523
How does my wife know about Tom Walker?

15:33.933 --> 15:35.685
- I don't know.
- I'll tell you how.

15:35.768 --> 15:38.112
Mike Faber.
And how the fuck does he know?

15:38.187 --> 15:40.281
- You tell me.
- Okay, Brody, calm down.

15:40.356 --> 15:43.530
You came to me, accusing me
of lying about Gettysburg.

15:43.609 --> 15:46.658
Maybe it's you who's the
one that's lying, hmm?

15:46.737 --> 15:49.365
- Puttin' some bullshit on me.
- I'm not.

15:49.449 --> 15:51.793
Why should I believe you?

15:51.868 --> 15:54.963
- I'll take care of Faber.
- How? How?

15:55.037 --> 15:57.665
Have you really got this under control?
Because it doesn't seem like it.

15:57.748 --> 15:59.716
And what the fuck happened in that shop?

15:59.792 --> 16:01.965
How did you lose those six agents?

16:02.044 --> 16:03.921
We're investigating that.

16:04.005 --> 16:05.803
Great. So you're hedging. Roya's hedging.

16:05.882 --> 16:09.762
This thing is on, I'm at the center of it,
and I'm in the fucking dark.

16:09.844 --> 16:13.144
Brody, we'll deal with Faber, I promise.

16:13.222 --> 16:16.522
I know this is hard. I'm sor-

16:23.483 --> 16:25.406
Are you my chaperone for the weekend?

16:25.485 --> 16:27.328
Well, somebody's gotta do it.

16:27.403 --> 16:29.405
Oh, well, this should be fun.

16:31.699 --> 16:33.451
- Fuck.
- He's stressed.

16:33.534 --> 16:36.458
Well, he's a frickin' double agent.
No shit, he's stressed.

16:36.537 --> 16:38.335
I thought Saul and Estes
already wrangled Faber.

16:38.414 --> 16:39.757
Well, I guess it didn't take.

16:44.378 --> 16:46.051
Go to Brody after.

16:46.130 --> 16:48.007
You think?

16:48.090 --> 16:50.343
He's our only play here.

16:50.426 --> 16:51.928
He's everything.

16:54.305 --> 16:59.061
He's still with us, but he needs
to feel a sense of control, power.

16:59.143 --> 17:01.487
So empower the guy.

17:16.452 --> 17:17.874
I know it's unusual, Warden...

17:17.954 --> 17:21.208
but she's a C.I.A. asset, and it's urgent.

17:21.290 --> 17:24.042
My-

17:24.126 --> 17:27.130
I could, of course, go through the formal
channels, but if you could expedite this-

17:27.213 --> 17:30.433
it's truly a matter of national security.

17:30.508 --> 17:33.387
I know that you're a very important man.

17:33.469 --> 17:35.096
It has nothing to do with me.

17:35.179 --> 17:38.023
With agendas and access
I can only wonder about.

17:38.099 --> 17:40.943
I'm asking as a fellow
law enforcement agent.

17:41.018 --> 17:42.691
Can you move Aileen Morgan above ground?

17:42.770 --> 17:45.273
We all have our issues.

17:45.356 --> 17:49.202
Homeland Security funding
goes to the big cities. My budget gets cut.

17:49.277 --> 17:52.656
- I sympathize.
- And we all have our domains, don't we?

17:52.738 --> 17:55.708
And the United States
Penitentiary at Waynesburg is mine.

17:55.783 --> 17:58.081
- Understood.
- And in this domain...

17:58.160 --> 18:00.913
a big shot from the big city...

18:00.997 --> 18:03.796
with his fine credentials and...

18:03.874 --> 18:06.002
- heaven-may-care grooming-
- Excuse me?

18:06.085 --> 18:11.558
Just doesn't have the kind of power
he's accustomed to.

18:16.429 --> 18:19.182
I'll have orders sent from
the attorney general.

18:30.443 --> 18:32.821
- Mike Faber.
- Carrie Mathison.

18:32.903 --> 18:34.576
- Right.
- Thanks for meeting me.

18:34.655 --> 18:36.908
- You're welcome to come up.
- Yeah, I spend all day inside.

18:36.991 --> 18:39.494
I thought we could get some fresh air.

18:42.079 --> 18:44.002
So what's this about?

18:44.081 --> 18:46.550
Well, it's about giving
you the lay of the land.

18:46.626 --> 18:48.924
- Regarding?
- Which I really shouldn't have to do...

18:49.003 --> 18:51.597
since my colleagues
already told you to stand down.

18:51.672 --> 18:53.720
Ah. Brody.

18:56.010 --> 18:59.014
There's a terrorist event on the horizon.

18:59.096 --> 19:01.975
Nick Brody is essential
to our plan for stopping it.

19:02.058 --> 19:05.278
So if we weren't clear enough the first
time, let me drive it home again.

19:05.353 --> 19:07.822
Cease and fucking desist.

19:07.897 --> 19:09.899
Understood?

19:12.443 --> 19:15.743
- A terrorist attack.
- Yes.

19:15.821 --> 19:18.415
- They didn't say that at Langley.
- Well, they shouldn't have had to.

19:18.491 --> 19:20.710
You should have complied.

19:20.785 --> 19:23.664
- But you're emotional about Brody.
- No, ma'am.

19:23.746 --> 19:25.965
Because you're in love with his wife.

19:27.083 --> 19:30.383
- Excuse me?
- We know about you and Jessica.

19:32.380 --> 19:34.974
- There's nothing to know.
- You were with her.

19:35.049 --> 19:38.929
You were gonna move in,
but then... he came home.

19:44.016 --> 19:47.441
- That was a long time ago.
- Not really.

19:47.520 --> 19:49.614
Not when you've chosen someone.

19:53.609 --> 19:55.703
Look, Mike, it's-

19:55.778 --> 19:59.203
it's hard wanting something, or someone...

19:59.281 --> 20:01.500
that you just can't have.

20:01.575 --> 20:04.545
- You don't know what I want.
- Stop talking to her about Brody.

20:04.620 --> 20:07.715
Stop playing detective. it won't help her.

20:11.252 --> 20:13.050
What will help then?

20:13.129 --> 20:15.598
You standing by...

20:15.673 --> 20:17.926
looking out for her.

20:18.008 --> 20:22.184
Because sometime soon,
she and those kids might really need you.

20:26.934 --> 20:28.436
All right. I'll-

20:28.519 --> 20:30.487
I'll lay off then.

20:36.777 --> 20:39.326
I hope you get what you want.

20:50.666 --> 20:53.169
How long did they hold you?

20:53.252 --> 20:55.050
About eight years.

20:55.129 --> 20:58.178
They didn't just hold him, buttercup,
they broke his bones.

20:58.257 --> 20:59.474
Oh.

21:02.595 --> 21:04.222
That's crazy.

21:06.223 --> 21:08.317
Yes, it was.

21:08.392 --> 21:10.440
What else did they do?

21:13.689 --> 21:17.364
So, uh, how old is your boy, Congressman?

21:17.443 --> 21:19.491
He's almost 12 now.

21:19.570 --> 21:21.868
Did you ever just wanna kill yourself?

21:27.578 --> 21:29.455
You have some dark moments.

21:29.538 --> 21:31.006
Hey, Dad.

21:31.081 --> 21:32.879
You gonna swim?

21:32.958 --> 21:34.460
Sure.

21:34.543 --> 21:36.045
Will you excuse me?

21:37.963 --> 21:39.636
What's the water like?

21:39.715 --> 21:41.433
It's nice.

21:50.267 --> 21:52.269
Hey, Chris, we'll swim later.

21:52.353 --> 21:53.946
Okay.

21:56.482 --> 21:58.860
- It was nice meeting you.
- Nice meeting you.

22:15.042 --> 22:17.136
So-

22:17.211 --> 22:19.430
Gettysburg. What happened?

22:19.505 --> 22:21.928
We lost a battle, sir.

22:22.007 --> 22:24.510
- Why did you go in?
- There was no movement for days.

22:24.593 --> 22:26.595
We, um, made a judgment call.

22:26.679 --> 22:28.773
- And a poor one.
- In retrospect.

22:28.848 --> 22:30.600
People are not feeling safe, David.

22:30.683 --> 22:33.778
- I understand, sir.
- I'm not feeling safe.

22:33.853 --> 22:37.357
We can't have these lunatics on the
loose with their goddamned explosives.

22:37.439 --> 22:38.611
Obviously.

22:41.110 --> 22:44.364
- Another attack on our watch-
- We're on it, sir.

22:44.446 --> 22:45.948
Believe me.

22:47.074 --> 22:49.076
Well, I certainly hope so.

22:56.625 --> 22:58.673
You were right.

22:58.752 --> 23:00.720
The warden's a bastard.

23:00.796 --> 23:02.639
So is that it?

23:02.715 --> 23:05.138
No, we'll go over his head.

23:05.217 --> 23:07.390
Oh, good.

23:07.469 --> 23:09.972
- But in the meantime-
- What?

23:10.055 --> 23:12.683
- There are some very bad people out there.
- No way.

23:12.766 --> 23:14.518
- I need to know who this is.
- Don't you do that.

23:14.602 --> 23:16.570
- Don't you try to trick me.
- No one's tricking you.

23:16.645 --> 23:20.491
I'm not telling you shit!
Not till I get a window, permanently...

23:20.566 --> 23:22.694
and I see it on a legal fucking document!

23:22.776 --> 23:24.744
- Aileen-
- I'm not getting fucked over on this!

23:24.820 --> 23:26.367
No, you're not.

23:28.657 --> 23:30.534
You have my word.

23:49.845 --> 23:51.347
Sorry.

23:55.351 --> 23:57.353
I wanna trust you.

23:57.436 --> 23:59.530
And you should.

24:01.231 --> 24:04.235
I'm sorry I've become this person...

24:06.695 --> 24:08.197
but I have.

24:16.372 --> 24:20.218
I never knew one of these horses
from another until my wife passed.

24:20.292 --> 24:23.887
I always meant to sell 'em all off, but-

24:24.713 --> 24:26.215
Well, this one's a beauty.

24:26.298 --> 24:28.926
That's Amelia. It was her favorite.

24:29.009 --> 24:30.511
She fractured her femur...

24:30.594 --> 24:33.723
which usually means a trip
to the field with a gun, but-

24:33.806 --> 24:35.308
You rehabbed her?

24:35.391 --> 24:37.985
Uh, we harnessed her
into a horse swimming pool for therapy...

24:38.060 --> 24:40.062
all kinds of crazy stuff.

24:41.480 --> 24:44.700
Listen, I'm sorry
about the looky-loos at the pool.

24:45.901 --> 24:48.495
It's bad enough we went to hell and back.

24:48.570 --> 24:51.073
People wanna ogle the damage.

24:51.156 --> 24:53.250
Oh, you served?

24:53.325 --> 24:56.829
I was in the navy in Vietnam, U.D.T. 21.

24:56.912 --> 24:59.165
Mekong Delta in '69.

25:00.958 --> 25:03.552
I didn't think I'd make it
through the second tour.

25:05.045 --> 25:07.343
Yeah, it can do that to you.

25:07.423 --> 25:10.051
Coming home was a bitch though.

25:10.134 --> 25:12.478
It took a while, but I got myself back.

25:14.304 --> 25:16.056
Right.

25:16.140 --> 25:18.814
Like you. it didn't break you.

25:20.269 --> 25:22.271
Just don't call me a hero.

25:22.354 --> 25:25.733
They do that, don't they?

25:25.816 --> 25:28.114
As if there's some glory in it.

25:28.193 --> 25:31.163
Yeah, I was captured and shoved in a hole.

25:31.238 --> 25:33.787
All I did was not die.

25:34.616 --> 25:36.539
People need it though, Nick.

25:36.618 --> 25:40.122
They need you on a poster,
waving in a parade.

25:43.792 --> 25:46.466
I don't care much for Walden.

25:47.629 --> 25:49.506
Well, that's a surprise.

25:49.590 --> 25:51.433
He's a hawk, but he's ignorant.

25:52.593 --> 25:54.812
- He hasn't seen war.
- No.

25:56.263 --> 25:57.731
And there's trouble ahead, Nick.

25:57.806 --> 26:02.186
I mean, Iran, Israel,
this slaughter up in Gettysburg.

26:02.269 --> 26:03.987
Somethings coming.

26:04.980 --> 26:06.482
I think you're right.

26:06.565 --> 26:08.442
Mm-hmm.

26:08.525 --> 26:10.869
But the bottom line is,
I'm supporting Walden...

26:10.944 --> 26:13.823
because I'm looking eight years
down the road at you.

26:13.906 --> 26:16.250
- No, Mr. Henning.
- Rex.

26:17.993 --> 26:20.496
You give me too much credit.

26:20.579 --> 26:22.627
You're a soldier, and
you're very humble, Nick.

26:22.706 --> 26:24.708
Well, you're very kind.

26:24.792 --> 26:28.387
And you'll be right at Walden's hip
while he's president.

26:29.546 --> 26:31.469
Hopefully, you can help him be wise.

26:31.548 --> 26:33.095
All right, Rex.

26:34.176 --> 26:36.144
Honestly, the truth?

26:37.012 --> 26:39.435
I'm not that man.

26:39.515 --> 26:42.689
- I know you don't feel that way.
- No. No, really.

26:43.811 --> 26:45.313
I'm not.

26:49.566 --> 26:51.193
I'll see you tonight.

27:02.204 --> 27:03.456
Hello.

27:03.539 --> 27:06.042
Take the trail behind the stab/es.

27:06.125 --> 27:08.344
- Why?
- Go through the pasture...

27:08.418 --> 27:10.295
then walk up the path through the trees.

27:10.379 --> 27:12.427
Oh, yeah? What will I find there?

27:12.506 --> 27:14.679
Me. I'm in the clearing.

27:35.112 --> 27:36.238
Hi.

27:39.741 --> 27:41.789
Faber's gonna leave it alone.

27:41.869 --> 27:42.870
Good.

27:44.746 --> 27:46.714
So, Roya's pulling you into something, huh?

27:46.790 --> 27:49.088
I don't wanna think about it.

27:49.168 --> 27:51.762
- Is that why you're upset?
- Who says I'm upset?

27:58.385 --> 28:00.353
I was just having a long conversation...

28:00.429 --> 28:02.397
with the guy who owns this place.

28:03.640 --> 28:05.392
He was a soldier.

28:07.769 --> 28:09.817
He was a real soldier.

28:10.939 --> 28:12.907
Served in Vietnam...

28:12.983 --> 28:15.236
saw all the shit you see.

28:17.362 --> 28:19.615
Didn't lose himself.

28:21.450 --> 28:23.544
The worst part of it is...

28:25.162 --> 28:27.335
he believes I'm like him.

28:33.962 --> 28:35.635
That guy...

28:37.466 --> 28:39.639
is the man I could have been...

28:41.887 --> 28:43.514
if I hadn't-

28:51.688 --> 28:54.817
You know, it doesn't always
work out the way we want.

29:31.103 --> 29:33.697
Hey, is this for real?

29:35.357 --> 29:38.531
- I don't know.
- Are you just handling me?

29:38.610 --> 29:40.612
You know, keeping me close?

29:43.323 --> 29:46.247
Brody, I don't know, and I don't-

29:46.326 --> 29:48.374
I don't want you to feel used.

30:04.344 --> 30:06.438
You know what?

30:06.513 --> 30:08.891
I do feel used...

30:08.974 --> 30:10.817
and played...

30:10.892 --> 30:12.610
and lied to...

30:14.104 --> 30:16.357
but I also feel good.

30:23.363 --> 30:25.536
Two minutes with you...

30:27.242 --> 30:29.244
and I feel good.

30:36.501 --> 30:38.720
How do you pull that off?

31:27.469 --> 31:29.517
What are you doing?

31:30.555 --> 31:32.683
Liquid courage.

31:32.766 --> 31:35.394
Finn, let's just do this.

31:35.477 --> 31:40.529
- All right, just... let me pick my moment.
- No, I'll pick it. Now.

31:40.607 --> 31:42.860
Yeah? Right in front
of all my mom's friends? Huh?

31:42.943 --> 31:45.492
There's never gonna be a good time.
We have to suck it up.

31:45.570 --> 31:47.948
You don't know what you're talking about.
You're new to this world.

31:48.031 --> 31:51.232
If “this world" means lying and being a
coward, then I don't want any part in it.

31:51.284 --> 31:52.752
Dana.

31:52.828 --> 31:55.581
- What is this squabble about?
- It's nothing.

31:55.664 --> 31:58.588
- Bullshit nothing!
- Hey, stop cursing.

31:58.667 --> 32:01.170
- This is not okay.
- We killed someone.

32:01.253 --> 32:02.596
Jesus.

32:02.671 --> 32:03.638
What?

32:03.713 --> 32:05.715
Hit-and-run, a week ago.

32:09.553 --> 32:11.681
All right, let's take this inside.

32:12.431 --> 32:13.648
Inside.

32:15.350 --> 32:17.591
It was at Woodley Road.
She was just crossing the street-

32:17.644 --> 32:20.022
- Jesus, Dana. How could you just drive away?
- I know.

32:20.105 --> 32:21.948
We were scared.

32:22.023 --> 32:23.491
- That's no excuse!
- I know!

32:23.567 --> 32:26.070
- Okay, Mom, I know.
- You should have come to us.

32:26.153 --> 32:28.827
Well, we're here now.

32:31.324 --> 32:32.826
Finn, you've been drinking.

32:34.703 --> 32:36.046
No, I haven't.

32:36.121 --> 32:38.465
You've been drinking,
and now you have to leave.

32:38.540 --> 32:40.042
Go get your things.

32:49.384 --> 32:51.807
Dana, go to the room. Wait for me there.

33:02.564 --> 33:04.191
I can't believe this.

33:04.274 --> 33:06.527
It's awful.

33:06.610 --> 33:08.658
We have to deal with it head-on.

33:09.654 --> 33:12.954
We'll report it, get lawyers.

33:13.033 --> 33:15.286
We have to remember
we're on the world stage here.

33:15.368 --> 33:18.668
- Of course.
- And these things...

33:18.747 --> 33:21.626
have to be dealt with
in a-in a certain way.

33:21.708 --> 33:24.803
- Well, yeah, but-
- I know what to do.

33:24.878 --> 33:26.801
Leave it to me. We'll be fine.

33:29.090 --> 33:30.592
What does that mean?

33:30.675 --> 33:33.554
That means that I'll take care of it.

33:35.597 --> 33:37.270
How?

33:38.808 --> 33:41.402
You're gonna have to follow my lead here.

33:43.939 --> 33:45.657
I don't know, Cynthia.

33:47.359 --> 33:49.487
I need to talk to Brody.

33:54.491 --> 33:57.040
I'm waiting on
the attorney general to call back.

33:57.118 --> 33:58.586
Well, what's the holdup?

33:58.662 --> 34:00.380
His daughter's school play.

34:00.455 --> 34:01.957
Oh, fuck me.

34:02.040 --> 34:04.008
We ready to jump when I get a name?

34:04.084 --> 34:07.554
I got SWAT waiting.
I got the mute here to drive me.

34:07.629 --> 34:09.347
You 're going?

34:09.422 --> 34:11.424
With that gut wound?

34:11.507 --> 34:13.135
I'm fine.

34:15.679 --> 34:18.808
All right. I'll call you.

34:22.310 --> 34:23.812
I'm not mute.

34:37.909 --> 34:39.081
Contraband.

34:39.159 --> 34:40.377
Nice.

34:40.453 --> 34:42.420
Bread.

34:42.496 --> 34:43.543
Cheese.

34:45.458 --> 34:46.675
Wine.

34:49.545 --> 34:52.719
“The vineyards of San Juan, Argentina...

34:52.799 --> 34:57.896
with unique character.”

34:57.971 --> 35:00.315
Not bad for easy-top wine, right?

35:01.766 --> 35:04.189
You're nice.

35:10.150 --> 35:11.993
To your window.

35:23.121 --> 35:26.216
I think about that road trip sometimes.

35:28.043 --> 35:30.137
It was sort of fun, right?

35:33.882 --> 35:36.385
Under the circumstances.

35:45.018 --> 35:47.567
You were having trouble with your wife.

35:48.980 --> 35:50.482
Mira.

35:52.150 --> 35:53.652
Yes, I was.

35:55.570 --> 35:57.243
How is she?

35:57.781 --> 35:59.749
She is, um...

36:01.159 --> 36:02.911
in Mumbai.

36:05.246 --> 36:07.340
And you're not.

36:07.415 --> 36:09.634
That's about the size of it.

36:09.709 --> 36:11.586
Sorry.

36:13.088 --> 36:15.682
I moved to Lebanon shortly after.

36:16.925 --> 36:19.724
Maybe on some level to be closer to her.

36:19.803 --> 36:22.272
That's still pretty far from India.

36:23.431 --> 36:25.604
It didn't really do the trick.

36:34.776 --> 36:37.620
Hi, Robert. Intermission?

36:38.405 --> 36:40.203
Yes.

36:40.281 --> 36:41.407
Great.

36:41.491 --> 36:44.210
I owe you. Thanks.

36:44.285 --> 36:46.003
It's done.

36:47.122 --> 36:48.544
A window?

36:48.623 --> 36:50.591
They faxed over a signed order.

36:50.667 --> 36:52.761
Should be arriving any minute.

36:55.964 --> 36:57.466
Your turn.

37:02.053 --> 37:05.023
I have to see it first.

37:20.280 --> 37:21.623
Here.

37:23.283 --> 37:24.660
Thanks.

37:42.218 --> 37:44.266
Mohammed al Ghamdi.

37:44.345 --> 37:46.347
He's been in the States about a year.

37:47.682 --> 37:49.480
Where can we find him?

37:49.559 --> 37:52.153
Last I knew he was in Newark...

37:52.228 --> 37:54.230
somewhere near Military Park.

37:54.856 --> 37:56.108
Okay.

37:56.191 --> 37:59.240
He's gun crazy. if he sees you coming-

37:59.319 --> 38:00.992
Got it. On the gate.

38:01.070 --> 38:04.700
She stays in this room till I'm back.

39:16.062 --> 39:18.690
Why does this kid always get in trouble?

39:18.773 --> 39:21.276
- You gave him the car.
- This was a week ago?

39:23.278 --> 39:25.827
- Why doesn't he talk to us?
- Why?

39:25.905 --> 39:29.250
- Because he's scared of you.
- That's ridiculous.

39:29.325 --> 39:31.373
No, it's not.

39:35.498 --> 39:38.547
I don't think he ever planned to tell us.

39:38.626 --> 39:40.594
It was Dana who pushed it.

39:40.670 --> 39:43.844
- We gotta manage this.
- I talked to David Estes.

39:43.923 --> 39:46.893
He and the campaign guys
will deal with D.C. Metro.

39:46.968 --> 39:50.313
- Does Brody know?
- I think it's his wife we need to worry about.

39:50.388 --> 39:51.765
Because?

39:51.848 --> 39:54.101
She talked about police, lawyers.

39:54.183 --> 39:56.857
- She needs to not talk at all.
- Which I relayed.

40:05.528 --> 40:08.452
Hey.

40:11.534 --> 40:12.831
What's up?

40:13.953 --> 40:15.796
You know how Dana's
been locked in her room...

40:15.872 --> 40:17.749
not saying more than two words at a time?

40:17.832 --> 40:18.833
Yeah.

40:20.084 --> 40:23.338
If she did something terrible,
something criminal...

40:23.421 --> 40:25.344
we would go to the police, right?

40:25.423 --> 40:27.517
- What did she do?
- We wouldn't just gloss over...

40:27.592 --> 40:29.094
her doing something really, really bad...

40:29.177 --> 40:31.521
just because we're in politics, right?

40:31.596 --> 40:34.600
- Because Cynthia thinks-
- Cynthia? What? Slow down.

40:34.682 --> 40:36.184
Tell me what's happened.

40:50.156 --> 40:51.203
Finn.

40:52.033 --> 40:53.285
Finn.

40:57.830 --> 41:01.460
- I'm sorry if you're in trouble.
- It doesn't matter.

41:01.542 --> 41:04.170
Yeah, it matters.

41:06.339 --> 41:08.182
I'm not a coward.

41:09.175 --> 41:10.893
It's just-

41:10.969 --> 41:14.098
I know how this goes.

41:14.180 --> 41:16.603
My parents are different than yours.

41:19.477 --> 41:23.732
Man, this is why I liked you so much.

41:23.815 --> 41:27.570
'Cause you don't know how it goes... yet.

41:27.652 --> 41:30.030
- Well, how can you just accept that?
- What else can I do?

41:30.113 --> 41:31.865
I don't-I don't know, Finn...

41:31.948 --> 41:34.872
but I just don't get how
you live like that.

41:36.285 --> 41:37.958
So you don't get me.

41:44.168 --> 41:46.512
We're gonna report it...

41:46.587 --> 41:48.180
my parents and I.

41:50.383 --> 41:51.760
Yeah.

41:52.927 --> 41:54.679
Good luck with that.

41:55.805 --> 41:57.478
Finn.

41:58.349 --> 41:59.851
Bye, Dana.

42:25.209 --> 42:27.507
Ah, there he is. Brody.

42:27.587 --> 42:29.339
Your new pal's looking for you.

42:30.131 --> 42:31.599
A moment, everyone.

42:31.674 --> 42:34.393
First off, welcome,
and thank you for your presence.

42:34.469 --> 42:37.268
The price tag was not
for the faint of heart.

42:39.348 --> 42:42.522
Today I had a chance to
talk with Nick Brody.

42:42.602 --> 42:46.072
Now, we all know his story
and what he has withstood to be here today.

42:46.147 --> 42:47.694
And a betting man...

42:47.774 --> 42:51.404
might say he is the likely
vice presidential candidate.

42:51.486 --> 42:53.363
You've decided that, have you?

42:54.989 --> 42:56.957
I am supporting Bill Walden for president.

42:57.033 --> 43:00.913
- Whew.
- That's why you're all standing in my study.

43:00.995 --> 43:04.215
But the quiet surprise here is Nick Brody.

43:04.290 --> 43:08.591
Although he is not an officer,
he is, in fact, a gentleman.

43:08.669 --> 43:12.674
And I personally feel
that a Walden-Brody ticket...

43:13.674 --> 43:16.018
would make the future truly bright.

43:16.928 --> 43:19.602
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

43:20.932 --> 43:23.481
Excuse me, fellas.

43:25.978 --> 43:28.948
- Cigar?
- No. Thanks.

43:29.023 --> 43:31.151
What are we gonna do about Dana and Finn?

43:31.234 --> 43:33.657
We're on it.
But you should talk to your wife.

43:33.736 --> 43:35.238
Oh, we've talked.

43:35.321 --> 43:39.042
This will all be taken care of
if we all just stick with the program.

43:39.117 --> 43:41.245
What does “stick with the program” mean?

43:41.327 --> 43:44.251
Just let it lie. We'll clean it up.

43:46.124 --> 43:49.845
Are you saying it's okay that our two kids
just ran someone over in the streets?

43:49.919 --> 43:51.796
No, it's not okay...

43:51.879 --> 43:54.132
but we should not be benched because of it.

43:54.215 --> 43:56.138
We're about to run for office...

43:56.217 --> 43:58.720
the highest office in the world.

44:00.096 --> 44:02.098
It's a moving train.

44:02.181 --> 44:05.435
And a screwup by a couple of teenagers
isn't getting in our way.

44:05.518 --> 44:06.565
Understood?

44:15.903 --> 44:17.405
37 Sussex A venue...

44:17.488 --> 44:20.458
north side of the street,
freestanding, one story.

44:20.533 --> 44:22.535
Covered foot access from the front.

44:22.618 --> 44:24.666
Seal the rear with mobile units.

44:24.745 --> 44:26.292
Copy that.

44:26.372 --> 44:28.545
Suspect's name is Mohammed al Ghamdi.

44:28.624 --> 44:31.924
Six foot, 180 pounds,
assumed threat level four.

44:34.505 --> 44:37.884
Your location, eight minutes. Wait. Out.

44:37.967 --> 44:39.389
Eight minutes. Roger. Out.

44:57.945 --> 45:00.368
Federal agents! On the ground!

45:00.448 --> 45:02.246
Right now! Don't move!

45:02.325 --> 45:04.202
On the ground, now!

45:04.285 --> 45:07.585
All clear. We got one in custody.

45:09.707 --> 45:11.926
What is this?

45:12.001 --> 45:15.175
- Well, this ain't the guy.
- What guy?

45:15.254 --> 45:18.303
- What's your name?
- Mohammed al Ghamdi.

45:19.091 --> 45:20.638
The musician.

45:22.678 --> 45:24.180
You know, like...

45:24.263 --> 45:25.981
The Coldplay?

45:26.057 --> 45:28.401
His dad was head of security...

45:28.476 --> 45:30.729
for Aileen's family in Saudi Arabia.

45:30.811 --> 45:33.735
He knew Aileen from the pool club.

45:33.814 --> 45:35.282
Pool club?

45:35.358 --> 45:39.659
Yeah, he's some kind
of music grad student now.

45:40.529 --> 45:42.327
Half an idiot.

45:42.406 --> 45:45.285
- So she duped us.
- Whole thing was bullshit.

45:45.368 --> 45:47.462
She probably doesn't even know our guy.

45:48.579 --> 45:51.173
- Why would she do that?
- Maybe she was bored.

45:51.249 --> 45:54.924
- Got her jollies dicking you around.
- She knew we'd find out.

45:55.002 --> 45:56.925
What did it buy her?

46:02.385 --> 46:02.885
Aileen!

46:08.182 --> 46:11.231
Open the fucking door!

46:11.310 --> 46:12.732
Aileen.

46:13.437 --> 46:15.235
Oh.

46:16.023 --> 46:18.492
- You missed the sunset.
- No.

46:18.567 --> 46:21.116
Why did you do this?

46:21.195 --> 46:23.994
- I'm not going back.
- What?

46:24.073 --> 46:26.917
I'm never going back to that cave.

46:26.993 --> 46:29.246
- Guards!
- No, don't call them.

46:29.328 --> 46:30.955
Please don't, Saul.

46:31.038 --> 46:34.008
Jesus.

46:34.083 --> 46:36.131
Why would you do this?

46:36.210 --> 46:39.214
I just spent the day by the window.

46:39.297 --> 46:41.049
A whole day.

46:42.258 --> 46:44.932
Light, sun...

46:45.011 --> 46:46.684
a view.

46:47.430 --> 46:50.229
Best last day I could have.

46:52.727 --> 46:54.821
Jesus Christ.

47:20.171 --> 47:21.388
Hi.

47:23.382 --> 47:24.725
Let's go.

47:25.384 --> 47:26.476
Where?

47:26.552 --> 47:28.475
Metro Police.

47:33.768 --> 47:35.611
Mom will take Chris home.

47:43.361 --> 47:45.455
I'm so relieved.

47:46.864 --> 47:48.241
Come on.

47:51.202 --> 47:53.705
- I'm scared.
- I know.

47:53.788 --> 47:55.790
I'll be with you.

48:01.837 --> 48:04.681
- Hi, David.
- Brady's leaving.

48:04.757 --> 48:05.724
What?

48:05.800 --> 48:07.347
He just went AWOL with his daughter.

48:07.426 --> 48:09.394
Well, where's he going?

48:09.470 --> 48:11.438
I think he's about to blow this thing.

48:12.098 --> 48:13.224
How?

48:13.307 --> 48:15.480
Get in the car and call me. I'll explain.

48:29.323 --> 48:30.950
That was tough luck.

48:34.829 --> 48:36.923
I got emotional.

48:38.332 --> 48:40.505
I wanted to believe her.

48:44.004 --> 48:47.474
Well, they do that to us sometimes-
get under our skin.

48:51.220 --> 48:53.188
It was sloppy-

48:56.350 --> 48:58.853
And I know better.

49:10.865 --> 49:12.867
Any word on Galvez?

49:13.909 --> 49:15.627
Well, he's still dying.

49:20.040 --> 49:21.713
You're a real diplomat.

49:25.963 --> 49:28.136
He was good in the shop.

49:28.215 --> 49:30.217
I hope you don't lose him.

49:31.218 --> 49:32.720
Yep.

49:32.803 --> 49:34.976
We've had enough losing lately.

49:52.281 --> 49:54.409
Why is she here?

49:54.492 --> 49:56.210
I have no idea.

49:56.285 --> 49:58.287
Will you stay in the car?

50:05.461 --> 50:07.555
- Hi.
- I have my daughter here.

50:07.630 --> 50:09.598
I see that. I'm sorry.

50:09.673 --> 50:11.141
What's goin' on?

50:11.217 --> 50:13.185
You can't do this-go to the police.

50:13.260 --> 50:15.354
Are you telling me
you knew about this accident?

50:15.429 --> 50:17.056
No. I just found out too.

50:17.139 --> 50:19.517
- This is a private matter.
- It's not, actually.

50:19.600 --> 50:21.728
Because if you report this,
you'll alienate Walden...

50:21.810 --> 50:24.091
And Roya and Nazir want you near him,
for whatever reason.

50:24.104 --> 50:26.448
I don't give a fuck! This is my daughter.

50:26.524 --> 50:29.403
Brody, you won't have
a deal anymore if you do this.

50:29.485 --> 50:32.659
The whole thing will be off.
Do you understand?

50:32.738 --> 50:35.582
And that's for your daughter too, right?

50:41.372 --> 50:43.500
What is this?

50:43.582 --> 50:45.300
Hi, Dana. I'm Carrie.

50:45.376 --> 50:47.674
Yeah, I remember. What are you doing here?

50:56.303 --> 50:57.930
Dana...

50:58.013 --> 51:00.766
we're not gonna be able
to do this right now, okay?

51:00.849 --> 51:02.146
Why not?

51:03.352 --> 51:04.854
Because she said so?

51:04.937 --> 51:06.905
It's really complicated, Dana.

51:06.981 --> 51:08.858
No, actually, it's really obvious.

51:08.941 --> 51:11.535
The campaign, the election.

51:11.610 --> 51:13.578
What could be more important?

51:13.654 --> 51:16.658
We'll do this down the line.
I promise.

51:19.159 --> 51:21.412
- You're bullshit.
- Dana.

51:21.495 --> 51:25.341
No, Dad, you just-You really make me sick.

51:25.416 --> 51:28.169
Hey, Dana. Dana!

51:29.086 --> 51:30.133
Dana!

51:32.172 --> 51:34.140
- Your phone was off.
- This is fucked up.

51:34.216 --> 51:36.264
- I'm really sorry.
- It's not okay.

51:36.343 --> 51:38.061
- Brody-
- This is not okay!

51:38.137 --> 51:40.231
None of this is fucking okay!

51:43.809 --> 51:45.311
Dana!
