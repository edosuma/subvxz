WEBVTT

00:10.043 --> 00:11.344
Oh, uh, Dad.

00:11.344 --> 00:13.113
It's not here yet.

00:13.113 --> 00:15.982
How did you... You've been
yakking about it for weeks.

00:15.982 --> 00:16.983
Your new blazer's coming.

00:17.484 --> 00:18.985
It's Italian,
it's hand-stitched,

00:18.985 --> 00:20.887
it cost more money
than my first car.

00:20.887 --> 00:22.756
Yes, but it's made from
very expensive material.

00:22.756 --> 00:25.258
They have to find exactly
the right kind of goat.

00:25.258 --> 00:26.659
Looks like they did.

00:26.659 --> 00:28.862
DAPHNE:
Good morning, Dr. Crane.

00:28.862 --> 00:30.096
I made you a
special breakfast.

00:30.096 --> 00:31.631
Why, thank you,
Daphne.

00:31.631 --> 00:34.401
After all, blazer day
comes but once a year.

00:35.769 --> 00:37.637
The doorman said he was
on his way up with it.

00:37.637 --> 00:39.639
I wonder what's keeping him.

00:41.141 --> 00:42.175
Regan.

00:42.175 --> 00:43.076
Frasier.

00:43.076 --> 00:45.478
Long time no see.

00:45.478 --> 00:48.248
Yes, yes, it has been.

00:48.248 --> 00:49.949
I think the last time

00:49.949 --> 00:52.385
was when you came over
with that bottle of wine.

00:52.385 --> 00:54.254
Oh, right, right.

00:54.254 --> 00:55.655
And I met your
charming boyfriend.

00:55.655 --> 00:56.990
Scott.

00:56.990 --> 00:59.059
Scott.

00:59.059 --> 01:01.027
And he's not
my boyfriend anymore.

01:01.027 --> 01:03.496
Oh, well, he wasn't really
all that charming.

01:03.496 --> 01:04.763
(laughs)

01:08.535 --> 01:10.537
Well, it was nice seeing
you again, Frasier.

01:10.537 --> 01:11.838
Likewise.

01:13.000 --> 01:19.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:20.146 --> 01:23.416
Isn't that interesting?

01:23.416 --> 01:25.885
Just ran into Regan.

01:25.885 --> 01:29.122
It seems she's not seeing
that Scott anymore.

01:29.122 --> 01:30.990
What, the ballplayer?
Is she nuts?

01:30.990 --> 01:33.726
He had money, looks,
the whole package.

01:33.726 --> 01:35.829
Dad, let him go.

01:35.829 --> 01:37.931
Are you going to ask her out?

01:37.931 --> 01:39.732
I don't know.

01:39.732 --> 01:42.735
Every time I've had the chance
to get close to Regan,

01:42.735 --> 01:46.106
it seems I end up
looking ridiculous.

01:46.106 --> 01:47.941
Still...

01:47.941 --> 01:49.442
she did make a point
of letting me know

01:49.442 --> 01:52.445
that she was single again.

01:52.445 --> 01:54.948
Perhaps she's hinting
for another ride

01:55.381 --> 01:57.884
on the Frasier-go-round.

01:57.884 --> 02:00.253
Now, if we could just figure out

02:00.253 --> 02:02.589
why you always look ridiculous.

02:04.757 --> 02:06.025
Please, you're my last chance.

02:06.025 --> 02:08.527
Couldn't you...? All right,
no, it's okay, I understand.

02:08.527 --> 02:10.096
I understand.
Don't worry about it. Bye.

02:10.096 --> 02:11.064
(groans)

02:11.064 --> 02:12.031
Problem?

02:12.031 --> 02:13.533
Yeah, it's my
bachelor party.

02:13.533 --> 02:14.601
My best man
can't arrange it.

02:14.601 --> 02:16.102
I'm having a hell
of a time

02:16.102 --> 02:17.537
trying to find
somebody to fill in.

02:17.537 --> 02:19.038
Well, Donny, if you're
looking for someone

02:19.038 --> 02:20.607
to throw you an
appropriate shindig,

02:20.607 --> 02:22.909
I'd be willing
to volunteer.

02:22.909 --> 02:25.145
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

02:25.145 --> 02:26.946
Thank you, no.
It's okay.

02:26.946 --> 02:28.314
I just don't
want to impose.

02:28.314 --> 02:29.649
It's no trouble
at all, really.

02:29.649 --> 02:30.950
No, no, no, no. No.

02:30.950 --> 02:32.485
It's fine, uh, really.

02:32.485 --> 02:33.987
Thanks for the offer, though, Frasier.
(doorbell rings)

02:33.987 --> 02:36.322
I don't think we're talking
about the same kind of party.

02:36.322 --> 02:38.158
Donny, if you're
letting my reputation

02:38.158 --> 02:40.160
as an aesthete
cloud your judgment,

02:40.160 --> 02:43.163
I assure you I am just
one of the guys...

02:43.163 --> 02:46.666
capable of getting down and
dirty with the best of them.

02:46.666 --> 02:48.168
Your jacket, Dr. Crane.

02:48.168 --> 02:49.669
Oh, dear God!

02:49.669 --> 02:50.670
You never
fold cashmere!

02:50.670 --> 02:52.472
You'll misdirect
the nap. Get out!

02:54.574 --> 02:55.942
Donny, give it
some thought, hmm?

03:01.581 --> 03:03.650
Morning, Roz.
Hey, Frasier.

03:03.650 --> 03:05.151
Help me decide
something.

03:05.151 --> 03:07.153
All right.

03:07.153 --> 03:08.655
I'm thinking about
getting my eyes done.

03:08.655 --> 03:10.156
It's a little
expensive, but...

03:10.156 --> 03:11.124
Now, now, Roz,

03:11.124 --> 03:12.592
cosmetic surgery
is a drastic step.

03:12.592 --> 03:14.594
If you're worried about
those bags under your eyes,

03:14.594 --> 03:16.029
why don't you try
just a different concealer.

03:16.029 --> 03:19.032
Perhaps a good night's sleep
once in a while.

03:19.032 --> 03:20.466
I meant the laser procedure

03:20.466 --> 03:23.803
so I could see
without my contacts.

03:24.637 --> 03:26.005
Uh, my usual, please.

03:26.005 --> 03:28.508
I just saw the most
incredible thing.

03:28.508 --> 03:29.876
You will not believe it.

03:29.876 --> 03:31.578
What is it? You have to
see it for yourself.

03:31.578 --> 03:32.912
Mere words cannot...

03:32.912 --> 03:33.880
Ooh, new jacket?

03:33.880 --> 03:34.881
Yes, just came today.

03:34.881 --> 03:35.915
That's nice stitching.

03:35.915 --> 03:36.916
Thank you. Christophe.
No, really?

03:36.916 --> 03:37.884
Is something
wrong with the nap?

03:37.884 --> 03:39.385
Oh, my God,
is it that obvious?

03:39.385 --> 03:40.420
Would you
knock it off?

03:40.420 --> 03:41.421
What is so amazing?

03:41.421 --> 03:42.822
All right, come here,
come here, look.

03:44.757 --> 03:46.759
Come here. All right.

03:46.759 --> 03:47.760
You see that rotund woman

03:47.760 --> 03:49.262
coming out of
Choc Full of Donuts?

03:49.262 --> 03:50.563
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.

03:50.563 --> 03:52.332
Watch. Before
she gets to her car,

03:52.332 --> 03:53.333
she will finish
that bear claw,

03:53.333 --> 03:54.834
and then go back in.

03:54.834 --> 03:57.770
This is her third time.

03:57.770 --> 03:59.739
That's what you brought
us over here for?

03:59.739 --> 04:03.042
To gawk as some poor woman's
struggle with junk food?

04:03.042 --> 04:04.844
Big deal, so
she's overweight.

04:04.844 --> 04:06.346
You don't need
to point it out.

04:06.346 --> 04:07.247
It's rude.

04:07.247 --> 04:08.114
It's childish.

04:08.114 --> 04:09.616
It's Maris.

04:13.119 --> 04:15.622
(laughs):
 No way.

04:15.622 --> 04:17.123
Dear God,
are you sure?

04:17.123 --> 04:18.458
I'm positive.

04:18.458 --> 04:19.826
It's hard to believe
that's the same frail woman

04:19.826 --> 04:21.327
who once sprained her wrist

04:21.327 --> 04:24.297
from having too much dip
on a cracker.

04:24.297 --> 04:25.765
Maris was always
chubby as a child.

04:25.765 --> 04:27.267
Her whole life
she's been obsessed

04:27.267 --> 04:28.768
with keeping weight off.

04:28.768 --> 04:30.270
Something
must've snapped.

04:30.270 --> 04:32.272
Literally. When she saw me,
she swallowed

04:32.272 --> 04:34.774
and her necklace exploded
from the pressure.

04:37.143 --> 04:38.044
Look, look,

04:38.044 --> 04:40.413
there she goes...
back for more.

04:40.413 --> 04:42.749
You know, when I last
saw her at Christmas,

04:43.249 --> 04:45.752
she was her
usual tiny self.

04:45.752 --> 04:47.186
Wait, Niles,

04:47.186 --> 04:48.588
wasn't that about the time

04:48.588 --> 04:50.089
you started dating
her plastic surgeon?

04:50.089 --> 04:52.058
Actually, it was.

04:52.592 --> 04:54.093
You think that could
have triggered

04:54.093 --> 04:55.561
some sort of binge?
Well...

04:55.561 --> 04:57.063
Well, this isn't
going to help.

04:57.063 --> 04:58.998
Mel and I are in the
society page today.

04:58.998 --> 05:01.301
It's our picture at
the symphony benefit.

05:01.301 --> 05:03.102
I shudder to think how Maris
will react to that.

05:03.102 --> 05:05.038
You know how petty and jealous
she can get.

05:05.038 --> 05:07.507
They never take a photo of me,

05:07.507 --> 05:09.475
and I'm in
the Conductor's Circle.

05:09.475 --> 05:12.478
Well, she moved next door
to the Italian deli.

05:12.478 --> 05:15.481
The guy just took the two-foot
salami out of the window.

05:15.481 --> 05:17.984
I can't face her now.

05:17.984 --> 05:19.485
That salami string
should keep her busy

05:19.485 --> 05:20.987
until I can get to my car.

05:20.987 --> 05:21.821
Niles...

05:21.821 --> 05:23.690
Hey, is that Niles
in the paper?

05:23.690 --> 05:25.558
Yes. He just happened
to have a copy with him.

05:25.558 --> 05:27.560
As if anyone cares about
such trivial matters.

05:27.560 --> 05:28.828
Oh, yeah, right.

05:28.828 --> 05:30.096
This is eating you up.

05:30.096 --> 05:33.099
You live for this
hoity-toity crap.

05:33.099 --> 05:34.600
Thank you.
I certainly do not.

05:34.600 --> 05:36.002
Why does everyone
think that?

05:36.002 --> 05:38.404
You know, just this morning
Donny said I was too fussy

05:38.404 --> 05:40.306
to throw him
a bachelor party.

05:40.306 --> 05:42.175
Well, you do give off
kind of a fussy vibe.

05:42.175 --> 05:44.477
You know, there are other
sides to my personality.

05:44.477 --> 05:45.745
I remember back
in my Boston days,

05:45.745 --> 05:48.247
I had a regular bar
and a regular barstool.

05:48.247 --> 05:49.649
I even had a tab.

05:49.649 --> 05:53.453
Well, if you go back,
you should try having a beer.

05:53.453 --> 05:55.822
Oh, gosh, you know, maybe...

05:55.822 --> 05:58.224
maybe I have become stuffier.

05:58.224 --> 05:59.625
The highlight of my week

05:59.625 --> 06:01.961
was the arrival
of my hand-tailored coat.

06:01.961 --> 06:03.863
Maybe it's time
I loosened up a bit.

06:03.863 --> 06:06.833
Tried to tone down the
whole fuddy-duddy image.

06:09.802 --> 06:11.337
Hello, Donny?
It's Frasier.

06:11.337 --> 06:13.339
Listen, I would really
like to throw

06:13.339 --> 06:15.274
that bachelor party for you.

06:15.274 --> 06:17.143
No, no, I assure you
I know

06:17.143 --> 06:18.578
what goes on at one.

06:18.578 --> 06:20.580
Yes, I'm quite, quite qualified.

06:20.580 --> 06:22.081
No, really, I promise you

06:22.081 --> 06:24.584
a night of such
unrepentant debauchery

06:24.584 --> 06:28.588
that the mere memory will
delight you in your old age.

06:28.588 --> 06:30.590
That is, if you should
survive the night.

06:30.590 --> 06:32.091
(laughing)

06:32.091 --> 06:33.493
Think I'm overselling it a bit?

06:33.493 --> 06:35.862
Maybe a tad.
Yeah, all right.

06:35.862 --> 06:36.896
That's great.
Oh, great, great.

06:36.896 --> 06:38.197
Thanks, Donny.

06:38.197 --> 06:39.499
I'll tell you
what I'm going to do,

06:39.499 --> 06:41.501
I'm going to go out
and find you a stripper.

06:41.501 --> 06:44.003
Maybe even more than one.

06:44.003 --> 06:45.004
You bet.

06:45.004 --> 06:46.005
(laughing)

06:47.473 --> 06:48.941
Strippers, huh?

06:48.941 --> 06:49.876
You betcha.

06:49.876 --> 06:53.613
A couple of real
red-hot mamas.

06:53.613 --> 06:55.882
You don't even know where
to find one, do you?

06:55.882 --> 06:57.750
Not a clue.

06:59.752 --> 07:03.823
(footsteps, coins jingling)

07:08.828 --> 07:11.330
(coins clattering)

07:20.673 --> 07:22.942
Damn.

07:22.942 --> 07:24.243
Damn.

07:24.243 --> 07:25.745
Damn!

07:25.745 --> 07:27.747
Damn.

07:27.747 --> 07:31.250
Open, damn you!

07:31.250 --> 07:32.084
Frasier?

07:32.985 --> 07:34.454
Regan.

07:35.888 --> 07:38.191
Well, this is certainly my lucky
day running into you twice.

07:38.191 --> 07:42.628
Gosh, I guess
this must look a little strange.

07:42.628 --> 07:44.864
Really, it's none
of my business.

07:44.864 --> 07:46.699
No, no, actually, it's
quite an amusing story.

07:46.699 --> 07:49.202
I was just getting
a Seattle Times here

07:49.202 --> 07:52.071
and I got my coat
stuck in the machine.

07:52.071 --> 07:53.773
That's not the Seattle Times.

07:53.773 --> 07:54.574
Hmm?

07:54.574 --> 07:56.075
(gasps)

07:56.075 --> 07:59.078
Dear God, they should label
these things more clearly.

07:59.078 --> 08:01.981
This is some sort of a smut rag.

08:01.981 --> 08:03.850
It was nice seeing you.
Regan...

08:03.850 --> 08:05.885
Regan...

08:05.885 --> 08:07.887
Regan...

08:10.857 --> 08:12.325
Well, if you get any in,

08:12.325 --> 08:13.359
could you
please call me?

08:13.359 --> 08:15.294
Thank you.

08:15.294 --> 08:16.796
Gosh, I'm off
to one hell of a start

08:16.796 --> 08:18.297
with this bachelor party.

08:18.297 --> 08:19.799
First, the debacle with Regan,

08:19.799 --> 08:20.800
now Syd's Novelty Shop

08:20.800 --> 08:24.303
is completely out
of naughty coasters.

08:24.303 --> 08:26.272
Oh, will you stop moping.

08:26.272 --> 08:29.175
It'll all work ass.

08:29.175 --> 08:30.877
What?

08:30.877 --> 08:33.179
For God's sake,
give me that!

08:33.179 --> 08:35.615
What the hell
are you doing?

08:35.615 --> 08:37.015
DONNY:
Honey, if your head hurts,

08:37.015 --> 08:37.850
we don't have to go.

08:37.850 --> 08:39.284
No, no.
I'll be fine.

08:39.284 --> 08:40.285
All right.

08:40.285 --> 08:42.288
Dr. Crane, I just want
to tell you how happy I am

08:42.288 --> 08:43.789
you're throwing
Donny's bachelor party.

08:43.789 --> 08:44.790
Oh, well, there,

08:44.790 --> 08:46.259
you see?

08:46.259 --> 08:47.126
At least someone thinks

08:47.126 --> 08:48.461
I'm capable of throwing
a proper...

08:48.461 --> 08:49.462
A nice, low-key party

08:49.462 --> 08:51.297
just like my honey-bunny
insisted.

08:51.297 --> 08:52.598
DAPHNE:
Honestly,

08:52.598 --> 08:54.600
why men have to celebrate
getting married

08:54.600 --> 08:56.035
by having
bouncing bosoms

08:56.035 --> 08:57.436
shoved in
their faces...

08:57.436 --> 08:58.437
Yeah. Just...

09:00.439 --> 09:01.941
If I know Dr. Crane,

09:01.941 --> 09:03.442
your party will be over
by 9:30.

09:03.442 --> 09:06.445
Oh, we could all go out
for dinner afterwards.

09:06.445 --> 09:10.216
Oh, yeah,
that'd be swell, honey.

09:10.216 --> 09:12.818
Gosh, you know,
if Daphne is so down

09:12.818 --> 09:14.153
on this whole
bachelor party idea,

09:14.153 --> 09:16.155
maybe I should throw
a more sedate one.

09:16.155 --> 09:17.590
I don't want to get Donny
in trouble.

09:17.590 --> 09:20.026
Listen, your job is to give him
the party he wants.

09:20.026 --> 09:21.527
Everything else
is between them.

09:21.527 --> 09:25.498
It's absolutely
none of your boobs.

09:31.270 --> 09:33.773
Give me that!

09:33.773 --> 09:35.274
Stop that.

09:35.274 --> 09:36.275
(doorbell rings)

09:36.275 --> 09:37.743
(sighs)

09:40.580 --> 09:42.114
Oh.

09:42.114 --> 09:43.482
Frasier Crane?

09:43.482 --> 09:44.817
Yes?

09:44.817 --> 09:48.721
I'm looking into a report
of vandalism...

09:48.721 --> 09:53.225
of a newspaper vending machine
on Euclid Avenue.

09:53.225 --> 09:54.226
Does that sound familiar?

09:54.226 --> 09:55.227
Well, I-I may
have been

09:55.227 --> 09:56.729
in the area earlier
today, but, um...

09:56.729 --> 10:00.733
Somebody on the
scene recognized you

10:00.733 --> 10:02.101
as the perpetrator.

10:02.101 --> 10:04.403
Are you aware of the
penalty for vandalism?

10:04.403 --> 10:06.238
Uh-oh. Well, I...
I may have

10:06.238 --> 10:07.540
dented the machine
a little, but...

10:07.540 --> 10:10.443
Frasier Crane, you have
the right to remain...

10:10.443 --> 10:12.311
aroused.

10:12.311 --> 10:15.214
(evocative music playing)
Anything you see,

10:15.214 --> 10:19.385
can and will be
rubbed against you.

10:22.622 --> 10:23.889
She's a stripper!

10:23.889 --> 10:25.524
I get it, Dad!

10:25.524 --> 10:27.360
Thank you.

10:27.360 --> 10:28.861
Thank you, Officer.

10:28.861 --> 10:31.364
I-I knew that Daphne
was going to be gone

10:31.364 --> 10:32.698
most of the afternoon,

10:32.698 --> 10:34.533
so I figured I'd help you out.

10:34.533 --> 10:36.035
Boy, you hire her
for Donny's party,

10:36.035 --> 10:38.004
he'll put you in his will.

10:38.971 --> 10:40.339
So...

10:40.339 --> 10:41.140
do I get the job?

10:41.140 --> 10:42.575
Well, you...

10:42.575 --> 10:44.977
you certainly seem qualified...
overqualified.

10:45.945 --> 10:47.179
What's going on?

10:47.179 --> 10:48.447
Oh, Daphne!

10:48.447 --> 10:51.450
Oh, hello, I-I...
this is, uh...

10:51.450 --> 10:55.154
Officer Nasty, uh...

10:56.822 --> 10:58.624
She's, uh, leaving
the police force,

10:58.624 --> 11:00.893
and, uh, I'm thinking
of hiring her

11:00.893 --> 11:01.627
as the housekeeper.

11:01.627 --> 11:03.129
You see,
once you marry Donny,

11:03.129 --> 11:04.997
you'll still be Dad's
physical therapist

11:04.997 --> 11:06.599
of course, but
we'll need someone

11:06.599 --> 11:08.434
around here to do
the chores, won't we?

11:08.434 --> 11:10.302
Weren't you supposed to be
out with Donny today?

11:10.302 --> 11:12.438
Yeah, I was, but I've got
a splitting headache.

11:12.438 --> 11:13.839
Oh.

11:13.839 --> 11:15.841
So, how long have you been
on the force?

11:15.841 --> 11:16.842
Uh, you know, uh,

11:16.842 --> 11:18.844
I was just about
to-to show the officer

11:18.844 --> 11:20.846
around the house
and, uh, discuss terms.

11:20.846 --> 11:22.348
(doorbell rings)

11:22.348 --> 11:24.850
All right, it was nice meeting
you, Officer Nasty.

11:24.850 --> 11:26.152
Yes.

11:29.288 --> 11:31.624
Don't tell me
to calm down!

11:31.624 --> 11:33.626
It's a complete
disaster.

11:33.626 --> 11:34.627
She'll ruin me!

11:34.627 --> 11:36.095
What's going on?
Oh, it's Maris.

11:36.095 --> 11:37.096
She saw the picture
of us today,

11:37.096 --> 11:39.098
and she's determined
to take it out on Mel.

11:39.098 --> 11:41.100
Yes. She's telling everyone

11:41.100 --> 11:43.069
that I caused her weight gain

11:43.069 --> 11:45.504
by nicking her thyroid
during a neck tuck.

11:45.504 --> 11:49.241
I've already had
three cancellations.

11:49.241 --> 11:51.577
She never thinks about
anybody but herself.

11:51.577 --> 11:52.912
Daphne, get me
a cup of tea.

11:54.747 --> 11:57.083
Actually, I have a bit
of a headache.

11:57.083 --> 11:58.951
Oh, you could be coming down
with something.

11:58.951 --> 12:00.886
Wash your hands first.

12:00.886 --> 12:04.090
NILES: Darling, you have got
to calm down.

12:04.090 --> 12:05.357
Your shoulders
are so tense.

12:05.357 --> 12:07.326
Oh, you know, Daphne gives
a wonderful massage.

12:07.326 --> 12:09.595
That might be
just the thing for you.

12:09.595 --> 12:12.164
Actually, I was
planning on taking a nap.

12:12.164 --> 12:14.233
Oh, good, so
you're not busy.

12:14.233 --> 12:15.968
Shall we do it
in your room?

12:15.968 --> 12:16.836
Look, you two
run along.

12:16.836 --> 12:18.337
I'll take care
of the tea.

12:18.337 --> 12:19.839
I really appreciate
this, Daphne.

12:19.839 --> 12:21.640
You're welcome,
Dr. Crane.

12:21.640 --> 12:22.908
Hey, Niles.

12:22.908 --> 12:23.909
What?

12:23.909 --> 12:26.779
Guess what
your brother's doing.

12:26.779 --> 12:28.614
Pressing his new blazer?

12:28.614 --> 12:32.585
Yeah. Against a stripper.

12:32.585 --> 12:34.053
What?

12:34.053 --> 12:35.020
Yes!

12:35.020 --> 12:36.455
He's interviewing her
in his room

12:36.455 --> 12:37.456
for Donny's bachelor party,

12:37.456 --> 12:38.858
but don't tell Daphne.

12:38.858 --> 12:40.659
And how exactly do you interview
a stripper?

12:40.659 --> 12:42.128
I don't know,

12:42.128 --> 12:44.930
but I bet there's a real show
going on in there.

12:44.930 --> 12:46.198
If you keep the gun
in its holster

12:46.198 --> 12:47.700
until the very
end, you see,

12:47.700 --> 12:49.068
that way your act

12:49.068 --> 12:51.937
has, you know, more, uh...
impact, shall we say.

12:51.937 --> 12:55.307
Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

12:55.307 --> 12:58.144
Men seem to like my act
the way it is.

12:58.144 --> 13:00.079
Oh, well, I certainly can't tell
you about attracting men,

13:00.079 --> 13:03.549
but I do know a thing or
two about showmanship.

13:03.549 --> 13:06.418
Tell me, uh, what sort
of encore do you have?

13:06.418 --> 13:07.753
I don't have an encore.

13:07.753 --> 13:09.054
Trust me.

13:09.054 --> 13:11.857
With this act, we're
going to need one.

13:11.857 --> 13:13.292
Um, I have an idea.

13:13.292 --> 13:15.194
Well, Mel's all set up
with Daphne.

13:15.194 --> 13:17.263
Oh, well, maybe we ought
to tell Frasier

13:17.696 --> 13:19.765
this is a good time
to get that stripper

13:19.765 --> 13:21.267
out of here.

13:21.267 --> 13:22.201
Dad?

13:22.201 --> 13:23.669
Oh, Fras, okay, coast is clear.

13:24.170 --> 13:24.970
Everything's fine.

13:24.970 --> 13:27.740
Not exactly.

13:33.078 --> 13:35.014
How did that happen?

13:35.014 --> 13:36.415
Lord of the Dance here

13:36.415 --> 13:38.851
decided I needed
an encore.

13:41.687 --> 13:43.589
Well, I assumed
you had the key.

13:43.589 --> 13:44.590
I never use them!

13:44.590 --> 13:46.559
Oh... all right, we'll
just have to cut them off.

13:46.559 --> 13:48.360
All right, well,
come on in here.

13:48.360 --> 13:50.830
I'm Niles.

13:52.565 --> 13:54.366
Now, you might come
to a point

13:54.366 --> 13:57.169
where it feels like
you can't take it anymore.

13:57.169 --> 13:59.004
I call that "phase one."

13:59.004 --> 14:01.373
(Mel groans)

14:01.373 --> 14:03.709
Are you sure
you know what you're doing?

14:03.709 --> 14:05.644
I know exactly
what I'm doing.

14:05.644 --> 14:09.648
(yells)

14:09.648 --> 14:11.150
Oh.

14:11.150 --> 14:12.151
Just relax.

14:12.151 --> 14:14.954
Oh, this is all
Maris' fault.

14:14.954 --> 14:18.290
You know, she actually
called me and said she'd...

14:18.290 --> 14:20.593
lay off if I'd stop seeing him.

14:20.593 --> 14:21.894
What'd you say?

14:21.894 --> 14:23.829
Well, I hung up on her.

14:23.829 --> 14:25.264
How insane is this woman?

14:25.264 --> 14:28.767
She thinks I'd give up Niles
to protect my practice?

14:28.767 --> 14:29.735
I'm crazy about him.

14:29.735 --> 14:31.203
The way he laughs,

14:31.203 --> 14:34.206
the way he gets that
little glint in his eye

14:34.206 --> 14:37.009
when he's about to say
something clever...

14:37.009 --> 14:39.345
But you know what
I love the most?

14:39.345 --> 14:41.347
It's like there are
all these things

14:41.347 --> 14:44.850
that he could be if he could
just trust someone enough

14:44.850 --> 14:46.785
to help him
unlock it all, and...

14:46.785 --> 14:48.721
if I could be
that person--

14:48.721 --> 14:51.724
you know, that safe
person in his life--

14:51.724 --> 14:53.225
well, the more
I know him

14:53.225 --> 14:56.228
the more I know that's
all I want to be.

14:56.228 --> 14:58.597
Daphne?

14:58.597 --> 15:03.402
Oh...

15:03.402 --> 15:05.838
Oh!

15:05.838 --> 15:06.839
This isn't working, Dad.

15:06.839 --> 15:08.841
There's only one thing
left to do.

15:08.841 --> 15:09.842
Well, I got
to warn you.

15:09.842 --> 15:11.844
I'm not as good a shot
as I used to be,

15:11.844 --> 15:13.345
but you'll have to go out
on the balcony.

15:13.846 --> 15:15.848
I need a cup of coffee
to steady my nerves!

15:15.848 --> 15:17.182
Dad!

15:17.182 --> 15:19.919
I meant, go to a locksmith.

15:19.919 --> 15:20.853
Oh, thank God.

15:20.853 --> 15:22.621
All right,
let's go. Come on.

15:22.621 --> 15:23.923
Oh, wait, hold on.

15:23.923 --> 15:25.424
I have to put
something on.

15:25.424 --> 15:26.425
(doorbell rings)

15:26.425 --> 15:27.927
Wait, wait,
I'll get it.

15:27.927 --> 15:29.428
I'll get it.

15:30.429 --> 15:31.931
It's Maris!

15:31.931 --> 15:33.766
At least...

15:33.766 --> 15:35.134
I think it is.

15:35.134 --> 15:36.535
You need a bigger peephole.

15:36.535 --> 15:37.970
What on earth

15:37.970 --> 15:39.305
is she doing here?

15:39.305 --> 15:40.139
I have no idea,

15:40.572 --> 15:41.640
but we can't let her
anywhere near Mel,

15:41.640 --> 15:44.476
especially now that Maris
has the weight advantage.

15:44.476 --> 15:45.577
(pounding on door)

15:45.577 --> 15:46.812
What are we going to do?

15:46.812 --> 15:47.980
Take her into Frasier's room.

15:47.980 --> 15:48.714
FRASIER:
Wait, wait!

15:48.714 --> 15:49.715
I can't been seen like this.

15:49.715 --> 15:51.083
She'll blab it all over town.

15:51.083 --> 15:52.451
Get in the bathroom!
Right.

15:52.451 --> 15:53.452
I'll call you
when she leaves.

15:53.452 --> 15:54.787
Thank you,
Niles.

16:03.562 --> 16:06.365
You know, seeing as how
we have a-a minute or two here,

16:06.365 --> 16:08.367
I may as well
take this opportunity

16:08.367 --> 16:09.835
to end the suspense.

16:09.835 --> 16:13.639
You've got the job.

16:13.639 --> 16:14.974
I've got a little news
for you, too.

16:14.974 --> 16:15.941
Hmm?

16:15.941 --> 16:18.911
I've been on the clock since
you slapped the cuffs on me.

16:18.911 --> 16:21.613
Fair enough.

16:21.613 --> 16:24.450
Ooh. It's
freezing in here.

16:24.450 --> 16:26.452
Oh, uh, yes, here,
let me...

16:26.952 --> 16:28.954
I seem to remember
doing this

16:29.455 --> 16:33.459
back in my college days
at a fraternity hazing.

16:33.459 --> 16:35.461
Here you are.

16:35.461 --> 16:36.962
Oh... here you go.

16:36.962 --> 16:38.464
Yeah.

16:38.464 --> 16:39.431
(clears throat)

16:39.431 --> 16:40.899
Thank you.

16:42.334 --> 16:45.838
It's hand-stitched.

16:45.838 --> 16:47.806
MARTIN:
Frasier, come on out.

16:47.806 --> 16:49.241
All right,
we're out of here.

16:49.241 --> 16:50.642
My God! Have
you seen Maris?!

16:51.176 --> 16:52.177
Yes, Dad, I know.

16:52.177 --> 16:53.612
Did Niles
calm her down?

16:53.612 --> 16:55.080
Yeah, he took her to your room

16:55.080 --> 16:56.482
but he had to
butter her up a little.

16:56.482 --> 16:58.684
I was afraid that narrow doorway
might pose a problem.

17:00.352 --> 17:01.687
(shrieks)

17:01.687 --> 17:02.688
Frasier!

17:02.688 --> 17:03.655
Regan.

17:03.655 --> 17:04.690
Hello.

17:04.690 --> 17:06.191
(nervous chuckle)

17:06.191 --> 17:07.192
Uh, listen, uh,

17:07.192 --> 17:08.961
I'm sorry about
this afternoon, um...

17:08.961 --> 17:10.262
Oh, forget about that.

17:10.262 --> 17:11.563
It was no big deal.

17:11.563 --> 17:12.865
By the way, uh,

17:12.865 --> 17:15.367
I was wondering
if you'd be available to...

17:15.367 --> 17:17.368
Oh, Lord.
Oh!

17:22.574 --> 17:23.976
(sighs)

17:23.976 --> 17:25.411
Gosh...

17:25.411 --> 17:26.412
no need to
be embarrassed

17:26.412 --> 17:27.913
about that,
you know?

17:27.913 --> 17:29.782
I do that sort
of thing all the time.

17:29.782 --> 17:31.550
Say, uh...

17:31.550 --> 17:32.885
you were saying?

17:32.885 --> 17:33.719
Uh...

17:33.719 --> 17:36.055
Yeah, just, uh...

17:36.055 --> 17:38.057
let me get all this
cleaned up first.

17:38.057 --> 17:40.559
Yes, uh...

17:47.533 --> 17:49.301
There you go.

17:49.301 --> 17:51.236
You know, I-I'd gladly
have helped you,

17:51.236 --> 17:53.205
it's just that
I've-I've hurt my back.

17:53.205 --> 17:54.706
You see, oh...
oh, gosh, oh!

17:54.706 --> 17:56.108
Oh, it's seizing up again.

17:56.108 --> 17:57.309
You know,

17:57.309 --> 17:59.144
maybe it would be best
if I just...

17:59.144 --> 18:01.480
went back inside
and crawled into bed.

18:01.480 --> 18:03.615
Good night.

18:04.883 --> 18:05.918
It's going to be
a moment.

18:05.918 --> 18:07.419
I figured.

18:07.419 --> 18:09.421
DAPHNE: I'm just going to
make us some tea.

18:09.421 --> 18:11.723
Back inside!

18:11.723 --> 18:12.558
Frasier!

18:12.558 --> 18:15.461
Oh...

18:15.461 --> 18:18.864
you're a lucky man
having this woman on your staff.

18:18.864 --> 18:20.365
Thank you again,
Daphne.

18:20.365 --> 18:21.366
You're welcome.

18:21.366 --> 18:22.668
Oh.

18:22.668 --> 18:24.369
Niles, where are you going
with all that food?

18:24.369 --> 18:25.704
Um, Dad is not feeling well

18:25.704 --> 18:28.707
so I thought I'd bring him
some comfort food.

18:29.241 --> 18:31.210
And, uh, by the way,
if anyone is going out,

18:31.210 --> 18:35.214
Dad specifically requested
something called a chalupa.

18:38.884 --> 18:40.385
(doorbell rings)

18:40.385 --> 18:44.223
Uh, Daphne, would you mind
getting that?

18:44.223 --> 18:45.491
You're not serious?

18:45.491 --> 18:47.893
You are on the staff after all.

18:47.893 --> 18:52.364
(Daphne muttering)

18:52.364 --> 18:53.365
Hi, Daphne.

18:53.365 --> 18:54.867
Hey, Regan.

18:54.867 --> 18:55.667
Come on in.

18:55.667 --> 18:57.002
Um...

18:57.002 --> 18:57.970
Oh, Frasier.

18:57.970 --> 19:00.506
I-I was concerned
about your back.

19:00.506 --> 19:01.473
You hurt your back?

19:01.473 --> 19:03.475
Uh, no, no.
Just a-a-a spasm.

19:03.475 --> 19:04.977
See, leaning against the wall
like this,

19:04.977 --> 19:06.745
it actually feels a lot better.

19:06.745 --> 19:08.046
Is it upper back
or lower?

19:08.046 --> 19:09.047
Uh, middle,
actually.

19:09.047 --> 19:11.049
If you could all
just leave me alone.

19:11.049 --> 19:12.384
Really, I'm fine
right here.

19:12.384 --> 19:14.419
Why don't we just get you
onto the couch.

19:14.419 --> 19:16.221
No, no, no, please, please.
I-I know what I'm doing.

19:16.221 --> 19:17.156
We'll each take a side.

19:17.156 --> 19:18.657
No, stop!

19:18.657 --> 19:20.058
No, Frasier, it could
be a thoracic strain.

19:20.058 --> 19:22.194
Or a bulging disc.

19:22.194 --> 19:24.363
Yes, impinging
on your lumbar nerve.

19:24.363 --> 19:25.664
Yes, it could easily be
any one of those things,

19:25.664 --> 19:27.666
but did you also consider
that it might be...

19:27.666 --> 19:30.669
the stripper
chained to my wrist?

19:35.007 --> 19:36.875
Officer Nasty!

19:36.875 --> 19:38.777
Oh!

19:40.579 --> 19:43.348
Everyone, this is Dinah.

19:43.348 --> 19:44.650
You see,

19:44.650 --> 19:47.085
this all happened
because I was trying to prove

19:47.085 --> 19:48.587
that I'm a-a normal guy

19:48.587 --> 19:50.589
capable of doing
normal guy things

19:50.589 --> 19:52.524
like throw a bachelor party.

19:52.524 --> 19:54.493
And Daphne, Donny didn't know
anything about it,

19:54.493 --> 19:56.361
so I wish you'd just
lighten up.

19:57.596 --> 19:59.331
Regan, I-I can't
even imagine

19:59.331 --> 20:00.632
where this must put us.

20:00.632 --> 20:02.634
I guess it's time
I just accept the fact

20:02.634 --> 20:05.137
that things will never
work out between us.

20:05.137 --> 20:06.605
You're certainly
not to blame.

20:06.605 --> 20:08.874
After today I...

20:08.874 --> 20:10.175
I can't see that any woman

20:10.175 --> 20:12.477
would even want
to go out with me.

20:12.477 --> 20:15.280
I think... I would.

20:25.824 --> 20:27.392
Hey, Fras.

20:27.392 --> 20:29.228
Oh, hi, Dad.

20:29.228 --> 20:31.029
How was your date?

20:32.998 --> 20:34.499
Well, it was nice, uh...

20:34.499 --> 20:36.501
we had a beer...

20:37.002 --> 20:38.003
Mm-hmm.

20:38.003 --> 20:39.004
Talked a bit...

20:39.004 --> 20:41.506
She has a hell of
a body, doesn't she?

20:42.007 --> 20:44.009
(chuckling)

20:44.009 --> 20:47.346
Dad, that is not
what this evening was about.

20:47.346 --> 20:50.515
This evening was about, uh,
taking a chance...

20:50.515 --> 20:54.219
getting to know
a different sort of woman.

20:54.219 --> 20:56.088
Turns out she's really
quite interesting.

20:56.088 --> 20:58.590
Dinah-- she's working her way
through grad school.

20:58.590 --> 20:59.591
She lives with her mother.

20:59.591 --> 21:01.093
She's extremely well-read.

21:01.093 --> 21:02.894
She even speaks
a couple of languages.

21:02.894 --> 21:05.197
Mmm. It really makes you
wonder, doesn't it?

21:05.197 --> 21:06.598
Yes, it does,
doesn't it?

21:06.598 --> 21:08.433
Makes you wonder
about how eager we are

21:08.433 --> 21:09.968
to judge a book by its cover.

21:10.469 --> 21:12.904
How willing we are
to stereotype each other.

21:12.904 --> 21:14.339
No, I mean it really
makes you wonder

21:14.339 --> 21:17.242
what that mother looks like.
