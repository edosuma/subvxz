WEBVTT

00:20.333 --> 00:21.533
I'll be back.

00:21.600 --> 00:23.066
I'm free.

00:46.233 --> 00:47.366
'Okay, lift it up here.'

00:47.433 --> 00:48.666
'Okay.'

00:50.400 --> 00:51.700
'That's good, tie it off.'

00:55.900 --> 00:57.666
Hello, Springwood.

00:57.733 --> 00:59.466
I'm the Luigi Santoni

00:59.533 --> 01:01.000
and if you like me

01:01.066 --> 01:02.400
you sick of the beef.

01:02.466 --> 01:04.566
When I first come to America
that's all I see.

01:04.633 --> 01:07.666
Red meat, red meat,
that's bad for you, right?

01:07.733 --> 01:10.033
That's why I'm gonna
take out the fryer.

01:10.100 --> 01:12.300
I'm gonna take out the grill.

01:12.366 --> 01:14.100
I'm gonna bring in the cheese.

01:14.166 --> 01:17.533
Sure, from now on
you can come down here

01:17.600 --> 01:20.966
have yourself a nice slice
of the pizza. I got everything.

01:21.033 --> 01:24.100
I got pepperoni. I got..
I got mozzarella.

01:24.166 --> 01:25.433
- 'Laura.'
- 'Hmm.'

01:27.700 --> 01:28.700
'God, Laura.'

01:42.666 --> 01:44.433
We're missing the party.

01:44.500 --> 01:46.166
I'll tape it.

01:46.233 --> 01:47.300
Adam..

01:49.300 --> 01:50.766
...I love you.

01:50.833 --> 01:51.933
I know.

01:52.700 --> 01:54.233
I love you.

01:55.833 --> 01:58.033
C-can we talk about this later?

01:58.100 --> 01:59.900
Forget it.

01:59.966 --> 02:01.600
God, this is hopeless.

02:02.500 --> 02:04.433
Besides...we're all out.

02:08.933 --> 02:11.233
W-why do you keep
buggin' out over this?

02:14.533 --> 02:15.900
Come on.

02:15.966 --> 02:17.933
You-you know how I feel.

02:20.400 --> 02:22.300
Don't I show ya?

02:22.366 --> 02:24.766
'Well, it's not the same.'

02:24.833 --> 02:26.200
'I want you to say it.'

02:27.566 --> 02:29.833
'After three years
is that so much to ask?'

02:33.866 --> 02:36.433
'That's what I thought.'

02:36.500 --> 02:37.600
'Bye, slugger.'

02:39.300 --> 02:41.233
What the hell
does she want from me?

02:59.366 --> 03:00.766
Look at this.

03:00.833 --> 03:02.900
I don't see anyone

03:00.833 --> 03:02.900
sayin', "I love you."

03:04.766 --> 03:06.833
Everyone,
Laura and I had a fight!

03:08.566 --> 03:10.533
Excuse me. Excuse me. Hello?

03:11.300 --> 03:12.233
What?

03:12.300 --> 03:13.633
Has everyone here stated their

03:13.700 --> 03:15.100
unconditional love
for one another

03:15.166 --> 03:16.233
in no uncertain terms.

03:16.300 --> 03:18.033
Shut up.

03:18.100 --> 03:20.266
- Hey, get out.
- Get outta here, man.

03:56.900 --> 03:59.133
Hey, look at this face,
would this face lie?

03:59.200 --> 04:00.966
I'm tellin' you,
these seats are mint.

04:01.033 --> 04:03.100
Come on, where else are you
gonna find front row, center?

04:03.166 --> 04:04.933
Your ears will be bleeding

04:05.000 --> 04:06.200
And if you don't
like those seats

04:06.266 --> 04:07.800
you can pick
any seats you like.

04:07.866 --> 04:12.266
1985 a very good year,
but I, uh..

04:12.333 --> 04:14.166
...think you're a little late.

04:14.233 --> 04:16.133
Shouldn't pick
on the freshmen.

04:16.200 --> 04:17.666
Hey, I'm just a businessman.

04:17.733 --> 04:19.333
What's up?

04:19.400 --> 04:21.133
Have you..
Have you seen Laura?

04:21.200 --> 04:23.400
Uh, only from the back, she was
heading out the front door

04:23.466 --> 04:25.066
last time I saw her.

04:25.133 --> 04:27.500
What's the matter,
you two have another spat?

04:27.566 --> 04:30.233
Have you ever told anyone
you loved 'em?

04:30.300 --> 04:31.366
Hey!

04:31.433 --> 04:34.033
No, I-I'm just really confused.

04:34.100 --> 04:35.900
Oh, oh. Is this what
this is about?

04:35.966 --> 04:37.400
You won't tell Laura
you love her?

04:37.466 --> 04:39.333
I thought it was serious.

04:39.400 --> 04:41.000
Hell yeah, I've-I've said it.

04:41.066 --> 04:43.766
Said it to, uh,
Sally in September.

04:43.833 --> 04:45.733
And then, Jackie in November.

04:45.800 --> 04:47.266
Di-did you mean it?

04:47.333 --> 04:48.466
I guess so.

04:48.533 --> 04:50.500
I mean at the time anyway.

04:50.566 --> 04:51.866
What time?

04:51.933 --> 04:52.900
Oh, come on.

04:52.966 --> 04:54.366
The critical moment.

04:54.433 --> 04:55.966
I mean, if anything's
guaranteed to get you over

04:56.033 --> 04:58.133
it's those three words.

04:58.200 --> 05:00.200
I-I-I don't think that's
what Laura had in mind.

05:01.466 --> 05:03.333
See, I just don't know
what to say anymore.

05:03.400 --> 05:05.866
Look, it doesn't matter,
just say whatever it takes

05:05.933 --> 05:09.333
I mean, if you're in a clinch,
meet her demands, it'll pay off.

05:09.400 --> 05:11.500
What I need is a girl
without any demands.

05:13.566 --> 05:14.966
Hey. Wait a sec.

05:15.033 --> 05:16.266
Y-y-you're a little
tipsy tonight.

05:16.333 --> 05:18.300
I mean,
who's your designated driver?

05:19.433 --> 05:23.100
Who's yours, man?
This is my house, remember?

05:25.600 --> 05:26.800
You sure?

05:51.533 --> 05:54.833
Adam better learn
the look of love.

06:15.300 --> 06:17.833
I-I barely know you.

06:17.900 --> 06:19.400
You know me.

06:21.166 --> 06:23.466
I should really tell you,
I'm.. Uh, I'm involved--

06:23.533 --> 06:24.866
- No, shh..
- With another--

06:24.933 --> 06:26.666
Shh, remember?

06:26.733 --> 06:29.700
No demands,
no explanations.

06:38.500 --> 06:39.766
Tell me you love me.

06:44.600 --> 06:45.900
I-I can't.

06:47.566 --> 06:50.200
Well, sure you can, it's easy.

06:50.266 --> 06:52.533
It's what every girl
wants to hear.

06:52.600 --> 06:53.766
Try it.

06:53.833 --> 06:54.900
I..

06:56.233 --> 06:57.533
I..

06:57.600 --> 06:58.633
Love..

06:59.633 --> 07:00.733
Love..

07:01.566 --> 07:02.633
You.

07:04.366 --> 07:05.433
You.

07:05.500 --> 07:07.433
See, that wasn't so hard.

07:28.366 --> 07:29.533
Oh, God.

07:30.366 --> 07:31.333
No, no, no.

07:32.766 --> 07:34.700
Please let this be
a platonic friend.

07:35.933 --> 07:37.366
Oh, God.

07:37.433 --> 07:39.400
The party, that girl.

07:40.400 --> 07:42.400
What am I gonna tell Laura?

07:46.733 --> 07:48.100
Tell me what?

07:48.166 --> 07:49.366
Laura, I..

07:49.433 --> 07:51.666
Who were you expecting?

07:51.733 --> 07:53.833
Oh, no-nothing, no one.
I, um..

07:53.900 --> 07:56.500
I just.. I just don't remember
you coming back last night.

07:56.566 --> 07:59.100
You'll never get rid of me

07:59.166 --> 08:00.333
Oh, no.

08:00.400 --> 08:02.066
My parents will be home from
the mountains any minute.

08:02.133 --> 08:03.066
We got to go.

08:03.133 --> 08:05.033
Ow.

08:20.733 --> 08:23.200
Oh no, I..
I don't want..

08:23.266 --> 08:24.800
Oh, God, I don't want..

08:24.866 --> 08:26.633
'You always said
you were a part of me'

08:26.700 --> 08:28.800
but if you're not
into it, I can fix it.

08:28.866 --> 08:31.066
No! I-I like being
part of you.

08:31.133 --> 08:32.466
I'll.. I-I ju..

08:36.266 --> 08:39.833
Please stop. Oh! Oh, God, no!

09:06.633 --> 09:08.000
"Last night was
only the beginning.

09:08.066 --> 09:10.033
I love you too, Loni."

09:10.100 --> 09:12.300
I love you too, Loni.

09:13.800 --> 09:15.833
So much for being
a figment of my imagination.

09:16.900 --> 09:18.500
Mom and dad.

09:18.566 --> 09:19.633
Beautiful.

09:20.866 --> 09:22.833
'Hi, honey, we're home.'

09:33.766 --> 09:35.733
It was clean
when I went to sleep.

09:36.966 --> 09:38.133
Relax.

09:38.700 --> 09:39.866
Oh, um.

09:39.933 --> 09:41.966
We said you could
have a party.

09:42.033 --> 09:44.000
But, uh, you clean it up.

09:45.733 --> 09:47.366
Dad, w-what happened
to your finger?

09:47.433 --> 09:49.933
Oh, nothing,
it's just a little accident.

09:50.000 --> 09:51.833
Um, it's, it's fine.

09:55.633 --> 09:58.366
Did you have a good time?

09:58.433 --> 09:59.400
Yeah.

10:00.200 --> 10:01.533
I-I-I guess.

10:01.600 --> 10:02.733
That's good.

10:02.800 --> 10:04.766
Because you have this big
scout interview coming up.

10:04.833 --> 10:06.100
A guy from the White Sox, right?

10:06.166 --> 10:07.566
D-don't remind me.

10:07.633 --> 10:09.233
Kinda nervous.

10:09.300 --> 10:12.733
Dad, when did you know
you really loved mom?

10:13.866 --> 10:16.300
You mean...you mean,
when did I..

10:16.366 --> 10:17.833
When did I tell her I loved her?

10:17.900 --> 10:19.700
Well, it's the same difference.

10:19.766 --> 10:22.200
Well, in a perfect world, maybe.

10:22.266 --> 10:25.833
But, you know, some people
say it when it's...convenient.

10:27.400 --> 10:28.333
You didn't say that
to Laura did you?

10:28.400 --> 10:30.400
Oh, no, no.
'Course not, dad.

10:31.533 --> 10:33.400
See, that's just
the trouble, I-I c..

10:33.466 --> 10:35.533
I-I can't say it.

10:35.600 --> 10:37.366
Well, are you sure
Laura's the right girl?

10:37.433 --> 10:39.066
I wasn't at first.

10:39.133 --> 10:40.233
I'm sure now.

10:40.300 --> 10:41.900
I-I love her, dad.

10:41.966 --> 10:44.300
Well, you be sure, son.

10:44.366 --> 10:46.533
You know, because..

10:46.600 --> 10:49.900
"...I love you," can be the most
important thing you ever say.

10:51.900 --> 10:53.000
Thanks, dad.

10:54.966 --> 10:57.100
It's probably Laura,
uh, I-I'll get it.

11:04.533 --> 11:05.533
Hi.

11:06.900 --> 11:07.900
Hi.

11:09.900 --> 11:10.800
Hmm.

11:13.033 --> 11:16.033
Spent all day
buying you gifts.

11:16.100 --> 11:18.033
What do you think?
Won't this look great on you?

11:20.533 --> 11:21.466
Loni..

11:21.533 --> 11:23.833
...please,
this-this is a little sudden.

11:23.900 --> 11:26.566
Well, that's love
at first sight.

11:26.633 --> 11:28.033
Don't you remember?

11:28.100 --> 11:29.033
You love me?

11:30.500 --> 11:31.966
Oh, God.

11:32.033 --> 11:33.000
Laura.

11:36.833 --> 11:37.800
Laura?

11:45.566 --> 11:46.600
Laura!

11:46.700 --> 11:47.800
Hi.

11:50.433 --> 11:52.200
Aren't you going
to invite me in?

11:52.266 --> 11:54.300
Oh, sure, but um..

11:54.366 --> 11:55.866
...wouldn't you rather go
for a walk instead?

11:55.933 --> 11:57.900
I-it's a beautiful day.

11:59.600 --> 12:01.033
He's mine now.

12:05.400 --> 12:07.666
He lovesme.

12:07.733 --> 12:08.700
'He said so.'

12:11.866 --> 12:12.900
You should go home.

12:18.233 --> 12:21.900
La-Laura, wait! Wait, please.
It's not what you...think?

12:23.900 --> 12:25.233
- Loni..
- Hmm?

12:25.300 --> 12:27.066
Listen to me now.

12:27.133 --> 12:28.800
W-whatever happened
between us..

12:28.866 --> 12:30.933
...I-I don't even remember it.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.500
I-it was an accident.

12:32.566 --> 12:33.833
A-a mistake.

12:35.633 --> 12:37.200
I was lonely.

12:37.266 --> 12:39.233
Well, so was I.

12:41.166 --> 12:43.800
Uh, look, I-I'm sorry, I'm-I'm
not the right one for you.

12:43.866 --> 12:45.333
I mean, I'm just..

12:46.700 --> 12:48.200
But you said you&lt;co

12:48.266 --> 12:50.933
Look, if I said I loved you,
I didn't mean it the way

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
you, you thought I did
with the..

12:53.066 --> 12:54.166
Look, let's get your gifts.

12:54.233 --> 12:55.533
No, keep 'em.

12:56.666 --> 12:57.633
It's alright.

12:59.166 --> 13:01.066
We all make mistakes.

13:01.133 --> 13:03.133
Maybe I'll see you
around sometime.

13:09.666 --> 13:13.300
That was a bad thing
you did, bad.

13:25.333 --> 13:28.366
Well, Adam, your stats for the
last three years are remarkable.

13:28.433 --> 13:31.733
I-I've just never seen such raw
talent at the high school level.

13:31.800 --> 13:32.733
Thanks.

13:32.800 --> 13:34.100
Well, it's more
than raw talent.

13:34.166 --> 13:35.866
Takes the strength,
the will, and the ability

13:35.933 --> 13:37.233
to control one's life, too

13:38.833 --> 13:40.833
Is this a friend?

13:40.900 --> 13:41.966
Loni, p-please,
we're in the--

13:42.033 --> 13:44.200
Oh, I'm sorry.
Am I interrupting?

13:44.266 --> 13:47.100
I just wanted to see
what the star was up to.

13:47.166 --> 13:49.400
- This beats being with me, huh?
- Loni..

13:49.466 --> 13:51.600
Uh, look, maybe we can
talk another time.

13:51.666 --> 13:52.733
'Oh, no, stay!'

13:52.800 --> 13:53.900
Let him tell you how he jumps

13:53.966 --> 13:55.133
from body to body saying

13:55.200 --> 13:57.566
"I love you," but forgetting
to mention it's only true

13:57.633 --> 14:00.233
while your legs
are in the air.

14:00.300 --> 14:02.033
Loni, will you, will you
please get out of here?

14:03.366 --> 14:05.766
I bet he's met with
a dozen other scouts.

14:05.833 --> 14:06.866
Two-timing creep.

14:06.933 --> 14:08.266
Well, okay, that about
does it for me.

14:08.333 --> 14:09.266
No, no, no, wait, please!

14:09.333 --> 14:10.300
Wait.

14:27.800 --> 14:30.400
'"I'm okay.
You're a guy."'

14:30.466 --> 14:31.933
'Little one sided.'

14:33.633 --> 14:36.100
"Love Stinks
A Woman's Handbook."

14:36.166 --> 14:38.000
I had no idea they were
so well organized.

14:43.733 --> 14:45.133
Home run!

15:01.533 --> 15:02.500
'Headache?'

15:04.733 --> 15:05.833
You might say that.

15:05.900 --> 15:07.600
Sure, you have a woman scorned.

15:09.800 --> 15:12.400
Hey, your old man knows.
Ha ha. Yes, sir.

15:12.466 --> 15:14.900
Your old man knows.

15:14.966 --> 15:17.966
We've gotta watch it, you know.
We have to stick together.

15:19.100 --> 15:20.933
You have to watch what you say.

15:21.000 --> 15:22.633
You have to..

15:22.700 --> 15:25.833
You have to be responsible about
the things you say to them.

15:31.300 --> 15:32.400
Right?

15:37.533 --> 15:39.600
W-where are you going?

15:39.666 --> 15:42.533
Well, your mother
and I are going out tonight.

15:42.600 --> 15:44.000
'Remember, no parties.'

15:57.566 --> 15:58.933
Hello?

15:59.000 --> 16:00.766
'"I love you,"
you said it to me.'

16:00.833 --> 16:02.133
'I love you.'

16:07.300 --> 16:09.300
'Adam, get the phone.'

16:13.366 --> 16:15.733
'We're going to be together,
Adam, one way or another.'

16:30.200 --> 16:32.900
'I-I'm glad I could finally
talk you into coming over.'

16:32.966 --> 16:36.033
There's only so much begging
I can take over the phone.

16:36.100 --> 16:38.133
I still don't even
know why I'm here.

16:38.200 --> 16:40.666
Maybe it's because deep down

16:40.733 --> 16:44.333
you know that I'm through
being confused...being afraid.

16:44.400 --> 16:46.200
Afraid of what?

16:46.266 --> 16:47.866
Of your feelings.

16:47.933 --> 16:50.000
M-my feelings, see..

16:50.066 --> 16:52.200
This whole experience
with that other person

16:52.266 --> 16:53.566
has taught me something.

16:53.633 --> 16:56.433
What? How to be more discreet?

16:56.500 --> 16:59.633
No, it's taught me
to appreciate...what I have.

17:00.666 --> 17:03.466
What do you have?

17:03.533 --> 17:06.033
Love for you.
No doubts, no holding back

17:09.333 --> 17:10.800
I love you.

17:12.000 --> 17:13.300
Are you sure?

17:14.533 --> 17:15.933
I love you.

17:20.533 --> 17:22.066
Don't you believe him, sister.

17:22.133 --> 17:24.100
He uses that line on everybody.

17:25.900 --> 17:27.400
Did you hear that?

17:27.466 --> 17:29.200
Hear what?

17:29.266 --> 17:32.766
I-I.. Nothing.
Ne-ne-never mind.

17:32.833 --> 17:35.233
Oh, you're probably
just dizzy from hunger.

17:35.300 --> 17:36.400
I know I am.

17:36.466 --> 17:38.133
I'll get us pie.

17:42.900 --> 17:43.900
Adam honey..

17:46.233 --> 17:47.300
...what's cooking?

17:52.400 --> 17:53.433
Laura?

17:54.766 --> 17:56.000
La.. Laura?

18:09.633 --> 18:10.800
Lau-Laura?

18:15.933 --> 18:18.466
Oh, Adam, forget Laura.

18:18.533 --> 18:21.000
She never had
a good head on her shoulders.

18:23.100 --> 18:25.166
Wh-wh-what is this? Wha..

18:25.233 --> 18:27.433
Oh, this is how
we punish bad boys

18:27.500 --> 18:29.433
'who don't live
up to their word.'

18:29.500 --> 18:32.533
"I love you"
is serious business.

18:32.600 --> 18:35.133
Yeah, I..
I did lov-love Laura.

18:35.200 --> 18:37.133
But you told it to this one.

18:40.333 --> 18:42.533
It-it-it was a mistake. I..

18:43.966 --> 18:46.666
These days you can't affor
a mistake like that!

18:46.733 --> 18:48.533
You better be sure
the one you say it to

18:48.600 --> 18:50.900
is the one you want...forever.

18:52.233 --> 18:55.266
I.. I made
the same mistake, son.

18:55.333 --> 18:59.566
Oh! And he's been&nbsp;
payingfor it ever

18:59.633 --> 19:03.133
But at least he takes
his punishment like a man!

19:05.133 --> 19:06.600
Come on, honey.

19:07.700 --> 19:09.833
No, wait. No.

19:09.900 --> 19:12.433
Go get yours.

19:18.400 --> 19:19.733
I-I-I..

19:22.133 --> 19:24.266
No, please don't..

19:31.933 --> 19:34.800
I'm alive.
Uh, it didn't happen.

19:36.100 --> 19:38.733
Laura. Laura, wait!

19:49.333 --> 19:50.866
Lau-Laura, wait. Laura.

19:50.933 --> 19:52.566
Laura. Laura.

19:52.633 --> 19:54.366
I-I can say it now.

19:54.433 --> 19:56.700
Say what?

19:56.766 --> 19:58.766
L-L-Laura?

19:58.833 --> 20:00.466
Well, who were you expecting?

20:02.333 --> 20:04.966
I.. I love you.

20:05.033 --> 20:07.100
See, that wasn't so hard.

20:08.966 --> 20:10.700
What's wrong?

20:10.766 --> 20:12.166
You mean it, don't you?

20:12.233 --> 20:14.800
You see,
I-I-I just had this dream

20:14.866 --> 20:16.833
that you were someone else and..

20:16.900 --> 20:19.066
Never mind. It-it's okay now.

20:20.233 --> 20:23.066
Damn. My, my folks are back.

20:23.133 --> 20:24.600
Don't go away.

20:29.433 --> 20:32.033
Whoo! Oh, give your
father a hand, would ya?

20:32.100 --> 20:35.300
- Had a bit of an accident.
- Dad, your hand.

20:35.366 --> 20:38.800
It was a fingertip compared
to a lifetime of happiness, son.

20:38.866 --> 20:42.533
Ooh! Honey, we ran into some
friends in the mountains.

20:42.600 --> 20:45.833
They're coming in Tuesday,
but their daughter came with us.

20:46.900 --> 20:49.500
Oh, she's dyin' to meet you.

20:49.566 --> 20:51.133
I've-I've already
got a girlfriend.

20:51.200 --> 20:53.366
Well, maybe not
the right girl, Adam.

20:53.433 --> 20:55.366
Meet Loni.

20:58.466 --> 20:59.533
Hi, Adam.

21:03.433 --> 21:05.300
I've heard so much about you.

21:14.266 --> 21:16.366
I had to ditch my old lady.

21:16.433 --> 21:18.633
Turns out, she was two-faced.

21:45.033 --> 21:46.633
Ooh!

21:49.666 --> 21:52.666
Had enough, Max?

21:52.733 --> 21:55.100
I don't wanna get a job.
I just graduated high school.

21:55.166 --> 21:57.033
I wanna have some fun.

22:03.366 --> 22:06.733
Why can't you be more
like your Uncle Ralph?

22:06.800 --> 22:08.800
'He's only five years
older than you.'

22:08.866 --> 22:10.800
And he's already
out of business college.

22:10.866 --> 22:15.266
It's time for you
to join the real world, Max!

22:15.333 --> 22:17.633
Time to take a little
responsibility.

22:17.700 --> 22:20.500
Time to get ajob!

22:20.566 --> 22:22.566
Never!

22:22.633 --> 22:24.800
Oh!

22:48.000 --> 22:49.733
- Hello?
- Max?

22:49.800 --> 22:52.100
'Hey, you slept through
the last day of school.'

22:52.166 --> 22:54.166
'Save it for college,
lazy bones.'

22:54.233 --> 22:57.866
Hey, forget college. Got a whole
summer of partyin' before that.

22:57.933 --> 22:59.833
Are you sure your mom's
gonna buy you a van

22:59.900 --> 23:01.400
and pay for our
part of the trip?

23:01.466 --> 23:02.833
Oh, yeah absolutely.

23:02.900 --> 23:04.000
I mean, she promised, you know.

23:04.066 --> 23:05.866
It's a combination
birthday-graduation present.

23:05.933 --> 23:07.066
I hope so.

23:07.133 --> 23:09.633
No problem.
She won't let me down.

23:09.700 --> 23:10.833
I'll talk to you later.

23:10.900 --> 23:12.033
- Alright, bye.
- Bye.

23:32.600 --> 23:35.800
Max shouldn't count his chickens
before they fry.

23:37.733 --> 23:39.933
Now, he's gonna be grounded..

23:40.000 --> 23:41.433
...by me.

23:44.733 --> 23:46.033
And them.

23:47.500 --> 23:49.533
I'd kill myself..

23:50.233 --> 23:51.533
Gnarly.

24:02.000 --> 24:03.633
'Max, Max, please!'

24:03.700 --> 24:05.833
Yeah, this is it. Van time!

24:05.900 --> 24:08.033
Hey! Okay, mom, you want me
to take you for a spin, huh?

24:08.100 --> 24:10.266
- Oh, Max, uh, sit down, honey.
- Wh--

24:10.333 --> 24:13.566
There's been a slight
change of plans.

24:13.633 --> 24:15.533
Oh, mom, come on.
You can't do this.

24:15.600 --> 24:16.966
I mean, not this time,
you promised.

24:17.033 --> 24:19.533
I know, but the money's
getting a little tight.

24:19.600 --> 24:21.766
I started to have
second thoughts.

24:21.833 --> 24:23.433
Now, listen,
I still have a surprise.

24:23.500 --> 24:24.900
Ralph?

24:24.966 --> 24:26.966
Maxie, good to see you again.

24:27.033 --> 24:29.166
W.. Wow! You sure are grown up.

24:29.233 --> 24:32.633
He's grown up, sis.

24:32.700 --> 24:35.033
Oh, God. Oh, God.
Please tell me this is a dream.

24:35.100 --> 24:37.766
Oh, Ralph's just back
from business school.

24:37.833 --> 24:40.466
We were discussing your trip
and he has convinced me

24:40.533 --> 24:42.800
that what you need
is a summer job.

24:44.966 --> 24:45.933
Nice work.

24:47.900 --> 24:51.300
He told me how difficult
it was for him in college.

24:51.366 --> 24:53.466
After taking the summer off
after high school.

24:53.533 --> 24:54.866
Mm-hmm.

24:54.933 --> 24:57.833
Uh, but, mom, I've been planning
this trip since the sixth grade.

24:57.900 --> 25:00.233
You could still have
the trip for a whole week

25:00.300 --> 25:01.633
at the end of summer.

25:01.700 --> 25:03.233
Oh, are you joking?
Come on!

25:03.300 --> 25:05.666
Jimmy's leaving
in ten days with or without me.

25:05.733 --> 25:07.300
I need my half
of the trip money.

25:07.366 --> 25:08.666
Think how much
better you'll feel

25:08.733 --> 25:10.333
after you've earned it yourself.

25:10.400 --> 25:11.600
Exactly.

25:11.666 --> 25:14.600
You're spoiled, Max.
I'm sorry, sis, but he his.

25:14.666 --> 25:17.633
This is your chance to learn
about responsibility.

25:17.700 --> 25:20.100
If your father were
still around, he'd agree.

25:20.166 --> 25:21.466
Yeah, right.

25:21.533 --> 25:23.533
Dad was just huge
on responsibility.

25:25.100 --> 25:26.966
You know,
thanks for stopping by.

25:27.033 --> 25:29.633
Ralph went out and got
that job for you himself.

25:29.700 --> 25:32.966
Well, I did it as a favor
for your mother.

25:33.033 --> 25:34.466
Look, I'll get a job.

25:34.533 --> 25:37.100
One that I wantafter

25:37.166 --> 25:39.400
If you want a car and a trip

25:39.466 --> 25:41.500
you're gonna have to go ou
and earn it first.

25:41.566 --> 25:44.600
You know, now I know
why dad left.

25:44.666 --> 25:47.233
I mean, how many promises
did you make him?

25:54.233 --> 25:55.566
Max, that was uncalled for.

25:55.633 --> 25:57.000
Hey, cool it.

25:57.066 --> 25:58.433
You know, you're only
five years older than me

25:58.500 --> 25:59.433
and you're not my dad.

25:59.500 --> 26:00.733
Thank God.

26:00.800 --> 26:02.000
Look at it this way.

26:02.066 --> 26:03.500
There's no job,
there's no trip

26:03.566 --> 26:04.933
there's no nothing.

26:11.366 --> 26:13.300
Alright, where do I work?

26:15.433 --> 26:17.400
Talk to a Mr. Santoni.

26:22.500 --> 26:23.700
Some trip.

26:23.766 --> 26:25.700
One way, all expenses paid..

26:26.700 --> 26:28.033
...to hell.

26:29.933 --> 26:31.233
Okay, Max, now..

26:31.300 --> 26:33.100
I show you about
the cash register

26:33.166 --> 26:34.733
and I show you the dairy case

26:34.800 --> 26:38.233
Now, I show you something
veryi

26:38.300 --> 26:40.300
Uh, yeah, but what
about making the pizzas.

26:40.366 --> 26:41.433
Come on, that looks like fun.

26:41.500 --> 26:43.233
No, that comes after.

26:43.300 --> 26:46.300
First you must learn
how to walk, then, you run

26:46.366 --> 26:48.866
You know, not everybody
know how to make the pizza

26:48.933 --> 26:51.133
even my day manager
has trouble.

26:51.200 --> 26:54.066
Okay, here you see
the

26:54.133 --> 26:57.766
Very important.
Never let it go past 600.

26:57.833 --> 27:02.533
She's old. She go over 600,
who knows what's gonna happen.

27:02.600 --> 27:04.833
Great. I could be toast
before I get to a beach.

27:05.900 --> 27:07.033
Hey, did you hear
about this place

27:07.100 --> 27:08.233
when it was Beefy Boy?

27:08.300 --> 27:10.500
I don't know,
they tell me a lot of stories.

27:10.566 --> 27:14.166
Bad things happen here. One boy
gets, uh, killed by a car.

27:14.233 --> 27:15.833
Another one gets, uh, shot

27:15.900 --> 27:17.066
but I tell you the truth

27:17.133 --> 27:19.500
I think I'm gonna
have good luck here.

27:19.566 --> 27:20.966
Well, the odds
are in your favor.

27:21.033 --> 27:23.433
That's what my day manager say.

27:23.500 --> 27:25.533
'I mean, hey, it could be
a lot worse, you know.'

27:25.600 --> 27:28.533
In fact,
there's my day manager now

27:31.833 --> 27:33.300
It's worse.

27:33.366 --> 27:35.666
Okay, boys, I gotta go.

27:35.733 --> 27:39.866
Now, Ralph, you give me a call,
in case anything happens, huh?

27:39.933 --> 27:42.800
Don't worry,
Mr. Santoni, I will.

27:58.833 --> 28:01.566
Don't worry,
Mr. Santoni, I will.

28:01.633 --> 28:03.733
What an ass-kisser.

28:34.366 --> 28:35.733
Wake up!

29:01.400 --> 29:02.900
Hello!

29:02.966 --> 29:06.466
Try not to space out on
the first day of the job, Max.

29:06.533 --> 29:07.900
Just doing a little
wishful thinkin'.

29:07.966 --> 29:09.966
You were wasting time.

29:10.033 --> 29:12.600
I was hopin' you'd be a little
bit more grown up than this.

29:13.900 --> 29:16.100
Look, head cheese..

29:16.166 --> 29:18.000
...you're my mom's
baby brother, alright?

29:18.066 --> 29:19.866
Where do you get off
making judgments about me?

29:19.933 --> 29:21.200
Someone's gotta
keep you straight.

29:21.266 --> 29:23.333
You know, I.. At least,
I didn't take off like your dad.

29:23.400 --> 29:25.800
Imadesomething of my

29:25.866 --> 29:27.066
Oh, yeah..

29:27.133 --> 29:28.933
I can see you've
really made the big time.

29:29.000 --> 29:31.700
Hey, a business is a business.

29:31.766 --> 29:33.900
And in a year
I'm gonna own this place

29:33.966 --> 29:36.600
because I understand something
about responsibility.

29:36.666 --> 29:39.933
Do you? Or do you follow
in daddy's footsteps?

29:40.866 --> 29:42.433
Get to work.

29:43.733 --> 29:45.733
Big man.

29:46.900 --> 29:49.133
I can make pizzas in my sleep.

29:52.333 --> 29:55.300
Okay, Max,
take a two minute break.

29:56.633 --> 29:59.033
Let's review, shall we?

29:59.900 --> 30:02.100
Monday, you burnt all the pies.

30:02.166 --> 30:03.433
They like 'em extra crispy.

30:03.500 --> 30:05.400
Tuesday, you gave out
all wrong the change, Max.

30:05.466 --> 30:07.100
Hey, I was never
good at fractions.

30:07.166 --> 30:10.033
And Wednesday, you delivered
30 pies to the penitentiary

30:10.100 --> 30:12.566
and you let them
have it oncredit.

30:12.633 --> 30:14.300
Yeah, where are they gonna go?

30:14.366 --> 30:17.266
Oh, you are lucky you're alive.

30:17.333 --> 30:19.800
Let me count my blessings.

30:19.866 --> 30:20.866
You're first week on the job

30:20.933 --> 30:23.466
was a disaster
ofbiblicalproportion

30:23.533 --> 30:25.733
Oh, great!
I'm fired, right?

30:25.800 --> 30:27.966
I mean, you never
want to see me again, right?

30:28.033 --> 30:30.433
You know,
you're half right, Max.

30:31.833 --> 30:33.933
You're not fired.

30:34.000 --> 30:35.866
Why are you playin' this game?

30:35.933 --> 30:37.366
Come on, you know
you don't want me here.

30:37.433 --> 30:39.666
Hey, a promise is a promise.

30:39.733 --> 30:42.033
Bull, I think you like seeing me
go through this torture.

30:42.100 --> 30:43.566
Hey, let me tell you something.

30:43.633 --> 30:45.633
You've had it too easy
for too long, do you hear me?

30:45.700 --> 30:48.266
Just too easy, too much goin'
for the quick route.

30:48.333 --> 30:50.833
Too much hustling.
You are here to learn--

30:50.900 --> 30:53.300
Hey, you can't teach
me anything, okay?

30:53.366 --> 30:55.333
You're a just a cheap
second-rate hustler

30:55.400 --> 30:56.666
who somehow cheated
his way through college

30:56.733 --> 30:59.733
andst
make it out of Springwood.

31:01.266 --> 31:02.666
You're gonna regret that.

31:02.733 --> 31:05.166
Yeah. I'm sure.

31:05.233 --> 31:07.200
Alright, look, I'm checking out.

31:07.266 --> 31:09.966
Thank God
I still have my nights.

31:10.033 --> 31:12.766
See, I unlike you have a life.

31:12.833 --> 31:15.066
Oh, that really
gets to you, doesn't it?

31:15.133 --> 31:16.966
I mean, sure,
you're Mr. Business.

31:17.033 --> 31:20.300
But I know how to have fun

31:27.500 --> 31:29.766
I'm tellin' you, Ryan.
I'm as good as gone.

31:29.833 --> 31:31.333
All I have to do is keep
botching the job

31:31.400 --> 31:33.866
and Santoni is sure to can me.

31:33.933 --> 31:36.133
Look, I'll get the money
some other way.

31:36.200 --> 31:37.966
I'll invent something,
you know?

31:38.033 --> 31:39.666
Make the quick kill.

31:39.733 --> 31:41.600
I mean,
anything is better than this.

31:43.000 --> 31:45.600
Yeah, well, if you want
I can, I can see you.

31:45.666 --> 31:48.533
About.. What is it, 6:30 now?

31:48.600 --> 31:49.833
Okay. Get the party..

31:55.866 --> 31:59.566
Oh, Max, my boy,
I got some bad news for you.

31:59.633 --> 32:02.133
Oh, Mr. Santoni,
no explanation needed.

32:02.200 --> 32:04.633
I, uh, I mean, you gave me
a shot, I screwed up.

32:04.700 --> 32:05.833
I'll send you
a postcard from Maui.

32:05.900 --> 32:07.566
No, no, come back here.

32:07.633 --> 32:09.100
I was gonna fire you.

32:09.166 --> 32:10.800
But Ralphie, he convinced me

32:10.866 --> 32:13.833
I should keep you on,
on the night shift.

32:13.900 --> 32:16.133
Yeah, Ralphie gonna stay o
as the day manager

32:16.200 --> 32:17.866
he's in charge
of all of the workers.

32:17.933 --> 32:20.700
And to tell you the truth,
at night business is dead.

32:20.766 --> 32:22.900
It's gonna be easy
for you to handle.

32:22.966 --> 32:26.033
And in lieu of a salary, you'll
be working on a commission.

32:26.100 --> 32:27.366
Isn't that right,
Mr. Santoni?

32:27.433 --> 32:28.433
Yeah.

32:47.900 --> 32:49.600
- Hi, Max.
- Dad?

32:49.666 --> 32:51.600
Don't take this crap, son.
Where's your guts?

32:51.666 --> 32:53.000
Take off like I did.

32:53.066 --> 32:55.033
Hey, how's the future
pizza king?

32:56.100 --> 32:58.166
Oh, Ryan, I'm buggin' out.

32:58.233 --> 33:01.166
I tell ya, we gotta do somethin'
to liven up this morgue.

33:01.233 --> 33:02.766
Everybody's on their way
to the flicks.

33:02.833 --> 33:05.100
You wanna duck out and come?

33:05.166 --> 33:06.866
No.

33:06.933 --> 33:09.433
No. I've got a better idea

33:21.966 --> 33:25.700
Okay, everybody, this is
my Hawaiian surfboard delight.

33:25.766 --> 33:27.933
- 'Oh, great.'
- 'Good, I'm starving.'

33:28.000 --> 33:30.466
Hey, Ryan, hand me the hotdogs.

33:30.533 --> 33:33.600
Okay, watch this. I call
this one Coney Island special.

33:33.666 --> 33:34.833
This isn't so bad.

33:34.900 --> 33:36.566
No, you know,
it's not Malibu

33:36.633 --> 33:38.833
but, uh, at least,
Ralph's not here.

33:38.900 --> 33:41.233
You know, we should
do this every night.

33:45.500 --> 33:47.566
You must be enjoying
that job, Max.

33:47.633 --> 33:50.266
You've been rushing off
to work for a week now.

33:50.333 --> 33:52.433
Oh, yeah.
I, uh, I like the night shift.

33:52.500 --> 33:54.166
It's relaxing.

33:54.233 --> 33:56.533
I don't know if I like you
being there by yourself.

33:56.600 --> 33:58.133
Remember what happened
to that other boy?

33:58.200 --> 34:00.066
Oh, mom, don't worry,
I'm not by myself.

34:00.133 --> 34:01.400
I'm packin' 'em in.

34:01.466 --> 34:04.000
Plus Mr. Santoni has let m
work on commission.

34:04.066 --> 34:06.933
You see.
I told you it'd work out.

34:07.000 --> 34:08.433
Bye, mom.

34:30.433 --> 34:31.400
I can't believe this.

34:31.466 --> 34:33.966
I mean...we're home free.

34:34.033 --> 34:36.033
One more week like this
I've made enough for the trip

34:36.100 --> 34:38.100
just one more week.

34:51.900 --> 34:53.000
Whoa!

34:53.066 --> 34:55.133
Isn't this girl
missing something?

34:56.033 --> 34:57.966
Yeah...sauce.

35:10.933 --> 35:12.200
Alright. Hey!

35:12.266 --> 35:14.666
Alright, everybody, out!

35:14.733 --> 35:16.066
Right now.

35:16.133 --> 35:17.433
Let's go.

35:17.500 --> 35:18.933
Come on, big guy.

35:19.000 --> 35:21.266
Move it! Move, move.

35:21.333 --> 35:22.833
'Later, Maxie.'

35:22.900 --> 35:24.233
Thank you. Thank you.

35:24.300 --> 35:25.666
Little lady.

35:25.733 --> 35:27.700
I'll talk to you later.

35:27.766 --> 35:29.166
Let's go.

35:29.233 --> 35:30.166
What are you doing here?

35:30.233 --> 35:32.666
I could ask you
the samequestion.

35:32.733 --> 35:33.800
Santoni thought that since

35:33.866 --> 35:35.766
you were doing such incredible
night business

35:35.833 --> 35:37.000
I should become night manager

35:37.066 --> 35:39.900
and find out what it is
that you're doing here.

35:39.966 --> 35:42.000
Well, now I know.

35:43.366 --> 35:44.433
Don't I?

35:57.966 --> 35:59.266
Look, it's clean, okay?

35:59.333 --> 36:00.966
Trust me.

36:01.033 --> 36:03.033
You know, you really tried
to show me up, didn't you?

36:03.100 --> 36:04.333
You tried to make me look a fool

36:04.400 --> 36:06.233
by being a hotshot salesman.

36:06.300 --> 36:09.166
Well, not tonight,
bucko, not tonight.

36:09.233 --> 36:11.166
Look, I'm just trying
to liven things up, you know.

36:11.233 --> 36:12.900
It's good business sense.

36:12.966 --> 36:14.800
Pay attention,
you might learn something.

36:14.866 --> 36:17.866
Hey, get this into
your empty little head

36:17.933 --> 36:19.133
if you can, alright?

36:19.200 --> 36:20.900
This place is mine,
the commission is mine

36:20.966 --> 36:24.200
and there's only room
foronesuperstar.

36:24.900 --> 36:26.766
Me.

36:26.833 --> 36:30.500
And I have my own
special ingredients.

36:30.566 --> 36:34.600
Ingredients you've
never dreamed of.

36:42.300 --> 36:43.233
Hey!

36:44.566 --> 36:47.466
"Dance Fever" was last night,
the party's over.

36:47.533 --> 36:49.700
Out!

36:49.766 --> 36:52.133
Look, never mind him, okay?
I'll come over and explain.

36:52.200 --> 36:53.800
No, you won't. No, you won't.
You're staying right here.

36:53.866 --> 36:56.533
No, you're going downstairs
to count flour sacks.

36:56.600 --> 36:58.400
That's better, right now.

37:01.300 --> 37:03.800
Just hang.
I'll be up in a sec.

37:03.866 --> 37:04.833
Alright.

37:09.533 --> 37:14.400
Alright, kids,
let's get one thing straight.

37:39.000 --> 37:40.100
Psst.

37:45.233 --> 37:46.633
Hey.

38:14.433 --> 38:15.500
Hi.

38:30.700 --> 38:31.900
Hey, where'd everybody go?

38:31.966 --> 38:35.733
Oh, they left, said something
about better things to do.

38:37.400 --> 38:39.166
- You threw 'em out.
- No. Really.

38:39.233 --> 38:41.500
They just said something
about going on a trip.

38:41.566 --> 38:44.366
Actually Ryan too.

38:44.433 --> 38:46.566
I think you've been sniffing
the mozzarella too long.

38:46.633 --> 38:48.266
Well, you don't
have to believe me.

38:48.333 --> 38:50.300
I know it's tough.

38:51.533 --> 38:53.600
Son of a bitch,
she didn't wait.

38:55.000 --> 38:56.866
Oh, I wouldn't worry about it.

38:56.933 --> 38:59.333
I'm sure she'll turn up.

39:19.800 --> 39:21.466
'Max, honey, it's 5 o'clock.'

39:21.533 --> 39:24.033
'You'll be late for work,
Ralph's expecting you.'

39:27.300 --> 39:29.466
You miss her,
don't you?

39:29.533 --> 39:32.533
I still can't believe
she just vanished.

39:32.600 --> 39:34.633
And the others too.

39:34.700 --> 39:36.633
All my friends are gone.

39:36.700 --> 39:39.233
They're probably just
driving around California

39:39.300 --> 39:42.400
and being very bad
not calling their parents.

39:42.466 --> 39:43.866
They'll turn up.

39:43.933 --> 39:47.000
Yeah, and by the time they do,
I'll be dead from exhaustion.

39:47.066 --> 39:49.033
- Busy?
- Busy?

39:49.100 --> 39:52.500
You kidding? Ralph's pie
sell like they're made of gold.

39:52.566 --> 39:55.433
He's doing it again,
showing me he can do it better.

39:55.500 --> 39:57.766
Using ingredients
I've never dreamed of.

39:57.833 --> 39:59.233
You'll get your
chance soon enough.

39:59.300 --> 40:01.966
Right now,
just follow Ralph's lead.

40:02.033 --> 40:03.700
Come on, mom.

40:03.766 --> 40:06.200
You've been telling me tha
my whole life.

40:06.266 --> 40:08.533
You know, when the place
was mine, at night..

40:08.600 --> 40:09.666
...I felt for the first time

40:09.733 --> 40:12.266
that I could do it
better than him.

40:12.333 --> 40:14.033
Now, he's back on top.

40:14.100 --> 40:15.666
Give him the benefit
of the doubt.

40:15.733 --> 40:16.900
He's trying.

40:16.966 --> 40:19.166
And his new pizzas
are delicious.

40:22.400 --> 40:24.266
Tonight has got
to be a record.

40:24.333 --> 40:27.933
I have never seen
so many pizzas change hands.

40:28.000 --> 40:30.866
Don't break your spatula pattin'
yourself on the back, Ralph.

40:30.933 --> 40:32.066
I mean,
we're the only game in town.

40:32.133 --> 40:33.300
Are you kidding?

40:33.366 --> 40:35.166
These people would suck my pies

40:35.233 --> 40:37.100
through a straw if they could.

40:37.166 --> 40:39.300
Well, what do you
put in 'em anyway?

40:39.366 --> 40:40.900
That's for, uh,
me to know.

40:40.966 --> 40:42.666
Oh, by the way..

40:42.733 --> 40:46.800
This is your, uh,
commission for the week.

40:46.866 --> 40:48.700
Two dollars..

40:48.766 --> 40:51.233
...and twenty-two cents.

40:51.300 --> 40:52.566
Good work.

40:52.633 --> 40:56.500
Great, at this rate I'll make
Malibu by the time I'm 40.

40:56.566 --> 40:58.700
I don't know whether
to die or go bowling.

40:58.766 --> 41:00.900
Why don't you, uh,
just go on home, Max?

41:00.966 --> 41:04.600
I'll lock up. I've got to
make tomorrow's pies anyway.

41:04.666 --> 41:06.400
Knock yourself out.

41:19.833 --> 41:22.433
Hey, Ralph,
I left my keys in the basement.

42:26.666 --> 42:29.700
So you've discovered
my secret recipe.

42:31.666 --> 42:34.000
'Well, it looks as if..'

42:34.066 --> 42:37.733
...you're going to have to
become one of the

43:06.100 --> 43:09.266
Here you see the temperatura.

43:06.100 --> 43:09.266
Very important.

43:09.333 --> 43:11.833
Never let it go past 600.

43:11.900 --> 43:16.100
She's old, she go over 600,
who knows what's gonna happen?

43:18.433 --> 43:19.533
Temperature.

43:19.600 --> 43:20.566
Thetemperature!

43:23.500 --> 43:27.100
Just blame this on that
little twit of a nephew.

43:36.100 --> 43:38.433
No. No!

43:53.766 --> 43:56.300
You know, we could put thi
trip off a couple of weeks

43:56.366 --> 43:58.633
Oh, no, no time.
Gotta get back to work.

43:58.700 --> 44:00.133
You work?

44:00.200 --> 44:03.800
That explosion must've
rocked your brain.

44:03.866 --> 44:05.066
No, I've seen the light.

44:05.133 --> 44:06.966
I got a future at Cheesy Boy.

44:07.033 --> 44:08.566
So did your late uncle

44:08.633 --> 44:11.233
and they're still
wiping him off the sign.

44:11.300 --> 44:14.200
Yeah, well, Mr. Santoni and I
are gonna rebuild the place.

44:14.266 --> 44:15.433
He's making me a partner.

44:15.500 --> 44:17.233
We're gonna open it
as Max's Make Your Own

44:17.300 --> 44:19.133
Pizza Pie Shop,
we'll rack up.

44:19.200 --> 44:20.933
I didn't know you were
such an entrepreneur.

44:22.100 --> 44:23.800
Only in the pizza business.

44:23.866 --> 44:27.266
See, I, uh, have my own
special ingredients.

44:27.333 --> 44:30.433
Ingredients,
you've never dreamed of.

44:36.133 --> 44:40.900
Sometimes, a job
can be a real nightmare.

44:40.966 --> 44:44.500
But Ralph deserved
the slice he cut for himself.

44:46.133 --> 44:47.800
Mmm.

44:51.866 --> 44:53.900
Special order.

44:53.966 --> 44:55.700
Don't upset me.
