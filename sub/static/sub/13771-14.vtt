18:51.956 --> 18:53.175
But?

18:53.262 --> 18:55.090
But nothing.

18:55.177 --> 18:57.832
I like to think I was a little
bit better with the other boys,

18:57.919 --> 18:59.921
but that's just further proof
that you got a terrible deal.

19:00.008 --> 19:03.011
Yes, boo-hoo for the boy
with two legs.

19:03.098 --> 19:05.013
You deserved a mother

19:05.100 --> 19:09.583
who was more patient
and more caring...

19:09.670 --> 19:11.150
and it breaks my heart

19:11.237 --> 19:13.152
that you didn't
get that mother.

19:17.852 --> 19:20.985
Thank you. Wow.

19:21.072 --> 19:22.161
Wow.

19:24.250 --> 19:25.555
Wow.

19:27.035 --> 19:28.906
I've just waited
so many years

19:28.993 --> 19:30.212
to hear you say that.

19:32.214 --> 19:33.955
Why don't I feel better?

19:34.042 --> 19:35.696
What do you mean?

19:35.783 --> 19:38.525
I mean, I actually had
fantasies where you said that,

19:38.612 --> 19:41.005
pretty much word-for-word.

19:41.092 --> 19:42.833
It's spooky how close it is,

19:42.920 --> 19:44.095
but it's not helping.

19:44.183 --> 19:45.401
Why didn't it help?!

19:45.488 --> 19:47.882
You want me
to say something else?

19:47.969 --> 19:50.406
No, no, I mean,
you said everything!

19:50.493 --> 19:51.886
Anything else
would just be fake.

19:51.973 --> 19:53.844
I mean, that was like
the perfect thing,

19:53.931 --> 19:58.109
and I am still filled
with all this resentment.

19:58.197 --> 19:59.981
Oh, my God, this sucks!

20:00.068 --> 20:01.896
That was, like, the one thing
I was living for

20:01.983 --> 20:03.071
and it's just...

20:03.158 --> 20:05.465
not working at all!

20:05.552 --> 20:07.554
Can you take
the soap opera outside?

20:07.641 --> 20:09.251
I want to watch the whore
that gives the weather.

20:09.338 --> 20:10.513
Mother, please!

20:10.600 --> 20:12.211
-[gasping]
-Just try to breathe.

20:12.298 --> 20:14.213
No! You can't just have
your life dream

20:14.300 --> 20:16.432
stripped away from you
and be okay about it!

20:16.519 --> 20:18.304
Do you want
a cold washcloth?

20:18.391 --> 20:20.131
I don't think so.
I don't know.

20:20.219 --> 20:21.524
I don't know what I want.

20:21.611 --> 20:22.917
Do you want me
to give you some money?

20:23.004 --> 20:24.962
How much money?

20:25.049 --> 20:27.400
I have-- I have $200.

20:27.487 --> 20:29.358
I only need $30 for the bus.

20:29.445 --> 20:30.707
Okay.

20:30.794 --> 20:32.056
Here.

20:34.058 --> 20:35.277
And the Tic Tacs.

20:37.453 --> 20:40.543
Okay, honey, just remember
that I love you.

20:40.630 --> 20:44.025
In my own imperfect, bad
mothering way, I do love you.

20:44.112 --> 20:46.070
I love you, too.

20:47.724 --> 20:49.422
Okay.

20:49.509 --> 20:50.553
I'll call you.

20:53.817 --> 20:56.342
Okay, Rockefeller,
it's lotion time.

20:56.429 --> 20:57.778
Cut your nails.

21:04.393 --> 21:06.613
[dog growling softly]

21:08.267 --> 21:09.920
Jennifer, cut it out!

21:10.007 --> 21:11.966
You're so bad.

21:12.053 --> 21:13.794
[chuckles]

21:13.881 --> 21:15.665
Your breath smells like feet.

21:53.790 --> 21:56.227
