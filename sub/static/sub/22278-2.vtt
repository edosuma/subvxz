NARRATOR: On this episode of
Life Below Zero,

00:03.367 --> 00:05.200
winter prep
goes into overdrive

00:05.233 --> 00:07.867
as the big chill
descends on Alaska.

00:07.900 --> 00:11.300
ANDY: Last year's moose hunt
was a big zero.

00:11.333 --> 00:14.167
NARRATOR: It takes
a village to keep
the home fires burning.

00:14.200 --> 00:16.667
CHIP: There's no point in me
trying to get myself
a new stove

00:16.700 --> 00:18.400
when I could just make one.

00:18.433 --> 00:22.600
NARRATOR: Erik travels
to a bear-infested island
for his next meal.

00:22.633 --> 00:24.367
ERIK: A sow with
two first-year cubs.

00:24.400 --> 00:25.600
Holy shit!

00:25.633 --> 00:27.000
Let's get out of here.

00:27.033 --> 00:29.900
NARRATOR: And time
is running out for Sue to land
a movable feast.

00:30.900 --> 00:32.067
Are you fucking kidding me?

00:58.733 --> 01:00.133
ERIK: I'm here
in Kodiak Island.

01:00.167 --> 01:02.333
Wind's blowing. It's overcast.

01:08.300 --> 01:10.800
Had a little frost last night.

01:10.833 --> 01:14.000
Had a bear come down the creek
and wake me up.

01:14.033 --> 01:16.633
I've been engaged
in guiding-related activities

01:16.667 --> 01:18.200
since spring bear season
in May.

01:18.233 --> 01:19.667
It's late fall now.

01:19.700 --> 01:22.167
I've been going essentially
for six months straight,
every day.

01:25.933 --> 01:28.667
I'm really fired up
just to get out and do
a little hunting of my own

01:28.700 --> 01:30.800
where I'm the triggerman,
and it's all about me.

01:33.433 --> 01:37.233
NARRATOR: Erik Salitan is in
one of the most remote parts
of Alaska,

01:37.267 --> 01:40.267
hundreds of miles
from his home in Wiseman.

01:40.300 --> 01:42.433
But for a subsistence hunter,

01:42.467 --> 01:46.000
the quest to stock enough meat
for winter is never-ending.

01:49.467 --> 01:51.933
First thing when I wake up is,
here's these goats
up on the hill.

01:51.967 --> 01:53.233
So that's pretty neat.

01:53.267 --> 01:55.733
I'm gonna give that about
3, 3.5 miles from camp.

01:55.767 --> 01:57.033
It's some pretty
rugged terrain

01:57.067 --> 01:58.667
that needs to be crossed
in between here and there,

01:58.700 --> 02:00.167
but it should be fun.

02:05.933 --> 02:09.233
NARRATOR: Erik won't only
be dealing with
a hostile environment.

02:09.267 --> 02:12.800
His path to the goats
is littered with aggressive
brown bears.

02:24.367 --> 02:27.233
ERIK: I don't really like
what I have going on here.

02:27.267 --> 02:29.700
It's a whole different world
down in the creeks.

02:29.733 --> 02:32.300
Thick alder.

02:32.333 --> 02:35.733
A lot of times in Kodiak,
you jump bears and deer
down in these creeks.

02:38.167 --> 02:41.967
There's bears on the Alaska
Peninsula that can reach up to
1,400 pounds.

02:44.467 --> 02:46.067
A little microhabitat.

02:47.967 --> 02:50.233
You never see these animals
out on the tundra.

02:50.267 --> 02:52.767
When the weather's bad
they're all holed up
down in here.

02:52.800 --> 02:55.267
So, always ready
if we jump a deer,

02:56.767 --> 02:57.933
or bear, or whatever.

03:00.733 --> 03:02.733
I already seen a couple goats

03:05.167 --> 03:06.800
that I didn't know were here,

03:09.433 --> 03:11.800
and nothing real
accessible yet, though.

03:13.367 --> 03:17.400
But goats aren't known
for living in too accessible
of a spot.

03:17.433 --> 03:21.000
We'll keep trucking up
to that high peak
and see what happens.

03:30.167 --> 03:32.100
ANDY: Every day brings
its challenges,

03:32.133 --> 03:35.167
every day brings
its frustrations
and its triumphs.

03:35.200 --> 03:38.800
Hopefully the triumphs prevail
over the frustrations.

03:42.633 --> 03:44.533
(DOGS HOWLING)

03:51.533 --> 03:53.633
(ALL BARKING)

03:55.233 --> 03:57.567
ANDY: I think people
are becoming
very disconnected

03:57.600 --> 04:00.033
from knowing
where their food comes from,

04:00.067 --> 04:01.900
taking care of
their own needs,

04:01.933 --> 04:05.333
preparing their own foods,
gathering their own foods.

04:05.367 --> 04:07.167
I think that's
a very dangerous thing

04:07.200 --> 04:09.300
for people to become
complacent about that.

04:18.100 --> 04:21.467
Cool. That powder's working.
It's dry.

04:23.500 --> 04:26.467
What I'm doing now is
preparing to go get our meat
for the year.

04:27.733 --> 04:30.933
The focus on hunting this year
is gonna be really strong.

04:30.967 --> 04:33.967
It's critical to me
that I get a moose this year.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.700
Last year's moose hunt
was a big zero.

04:38.600 --> 04:43.133
And we had to spend
a lot more money to bring meat
in from Fairbanks.

04:43.167 --> 04:45.767
I've been living out here
for about 30 years,

04:45.800 --> 04:49.167
and pretty much everything
you need to live is out here,

04:49.200 --> 04:50.967
but you gotta go get it.

04:53.133 --> 04:55.633
Making bullets
is just one more step

04:55.667 --> 04:59.633
in being independent
of other people
and other companies.

05:01.533 --> 05:04.033
To buy a box of
factory-made rounds

05:04.067 --> 05:07.767
is close to $60
for this particular calibre,

05:07.800 --> 05:11.533
and I can reload these bullets
for about $1.50 each.

05:14.933 --> 05:17.167
One bullet placed well,

05:17.200 --> 05:21.467
hopefully, will put
enough meat on my table
for one entire year.

05:31.000 --> 05:35.100
NARRATOR: An average moose
weighs approximately
1,600 pounds,

05:35.133 --> 05:37.533
and Andy and his wife, Kate,
will need the protein

05:37.567 --> 05:39.600
to survive
the long Alaskan winter.

05:41.900 --> 05:45.300
Hunting for moose
is the most frustrating thing
to do up here.

05:45.333 --> 05:49.733
We live in an area where
moose are not
highly populated,

05:49.767 --> 05:51.567
so you got to work hard
to get a moose here.

05:55.700 --> 05:57.833
I'm definitely seeing
some moose tracks here.

05:57.867 --> 05:59.433
It looks like a cow
and a calf.

05:59.467 --> 06:02.667
So where there's cows,
there's gonna be a bull.

06:02.700 --> 06:05.867
Gonna do some calling
for a moose right now
by scraping,

06:05.900 --> 06:07.967
and I'll be imitating
what it sounds like

06:08.000 --> 06:10.700
when a moose is rubbing
his antlers to clean
the velvet off.

06:19.033 --> 06:21.300
You up your chances
of harvesting a moose

06:21.333 --> 06:24.467
if you hunt in some of these
back sloughs.

06:24.500 --> 06:28.300
They tend to be full of water
and very nutritious food
for the moose.

06:29.633 --> 06:31.967
NARRATOR:
With sunlight wasting away,

06:32.000 --> 06:36.533
Andy only has a few hours left
to find his prey.

06:36.567 --> 06:38.633
ANDY: You know,
the stalking them
and hunting them is...

06:38.667 --> 06:41.033
Is always the part
that takes the most patience.

06:44.800 --> 06:47.600
It could very easily be
down here in this area.

06:47.633 --> 06:49.200
We'll see what happens.

06:55.033 --> 06:56.767
(COCKS RIFLE)

06:56.800 --> 06:58.767
SUE: Maybe it'll just be
a scouting mission,

06:59.967 --> 07:01.533
but there's no guarantees.

07:01.567 --> 07:03.533
I mean, if you got something
every time, it'd be called
shopping.

07:16.233 --> 07:17.333
Holy crap.

07:17.367 --> 07:20.367
Snow on Monday.
Snow on Tuesday.

07:20.400 --> 07:21.933
This is an absolute,

07:21.967 --> 07:23.867
smack-in-the-head reminder.

07:24.967 --> 07:27.867
My full-blown winter is
four or five weeks away,

07:27.900 --> 07:29.333
and I'll be below zero.

07:29.367 --> 07:31.733
We're not getting above zero,
no running water again.

07:33.600 --> 07:35.567
This is my opportunity,
a storm coming in,

07:35.600 --> 07:37.367
maybe driving
the caribou closer.

07:37.400 --> 07:39.333
It's an opportunity for me
to fill up my freezer.

07:41.600 --> 07:42.933
I've got a little bit
in there now.

07:42.967 --> 07:44.167
I need to fill it.

07:44.200 --> 07:47.667
And I've got 290 days a year
that I don't see anybody else.

07:47.700 --> 07:49.833
So I need to make sure
I have enough food to make it.

07:50.667 --> 07:52.067
A couple hours till dinner,

07:52.100 --> 07:54.367
might as well go be Super Sue
in the process.

08:20.267 --> 08:23.400
NARRATOR: Caribou can move
around 30 miles per day.

08:23.433 --> 08:29.067
Sue has to take advantage
any time food wanders
in range.

08:29.100 --> 08:32.033
To me, anything God makes
incredibly plentiful
on the planet

08:32.067 --> 08:34.167
probably isn't real high
on the food chain.

08:34.200 --> 08:36.800
Caribou tend to be
really plentiful out here.

08:36.833 --> 08:40.600
So they know that
they don't want to be seen
by the predators,

08:40.633 --> 08:43.800
and they get in these
little gullies, or walk
in the thick willows.

of winter
a few weeks away,

10:05.067 --> 10:08.700

storing meat
for the freeze-up.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.767
I don't know what's going on.
I mean, yesterday the scope
was good.

10:17.800 --> 10:18.867
Today it's...

10:18.900 --> 10:20.833
Either that, or I'm judging it
way the fuck off.

10:21.633 --> 10:23.300
I thought it was 300 yards,

10:24.133 --> 10:25.133
but may be more.

people know who
their next-door neighbour

10:56.433 --> 10:57.500
is in a lot of places.

10:59.667 --> 11:03.600
I think a lot of people live
among a lot of other people,
but they don't know anybody.

I've got dried fish,

I got some muskrats,

of bear meat left.

the money part

to trading things.

12:27.033 --> 12:28.633
It's legal to barter

It's legal to barter fish.
It's an old system, you know?

So I can use my caribou
that I've caught out here,

12:33.933 --> 12:35.433
and make it directly
into something

12:35.467 --> 12:37.100

than the meat itself.

12:37.967 --> 12:39.433

13:59.600 --> 14:01.633
and you can check out
the caribou meats.

14:05.733 --> 14:07.733
You can pick basically
anything you want.

14:07.767 --> 14:10.067
There's backstraps up there,
lots of fat.

14:10.100 --> 14:11.800
Back legs, front legs.

14:11.833 --> 14:14.200
Wow, it looks all great.

14:14.233 --> 14:16.567
Can I come back later
and pick this one up here?

14:16.600 --> 14:17.633
-CHIP: Yep.
-All right.

14:17.667 --> 14:18.767
CHIP: That'll be fine.

14:18.800 --> 14:20.167
Go get a Honda,
or a little bit of help
or something.

14:20.200 --> 14:22.400
-That's great.
-You got a long way
to go home. (LAUGHS)

14:22.433 --> 14:25.167
Well, let's get this thing
inside the yurt there, and...

14:25.200 --> 14:27.100
-CHUCK: Yeah.
-Just grab one end
or the other.

14:29.200 --> 14:30.700
CHIP: Figure out a way
to get her cut.

14:30.733 --> 14:32.333
CHUCK: All right. Sounds good.

14:32.367 --> 14:33.767
-Thanks, Chuck.
-Thank you.

14:35.467 --> 14:36.733
ANDY: If you're not organised,

14:36.767 --> 14:38.300
and if you don't have
a vision,

14:38.333 --> 14:41.567
and if you don't know
how to plan
and have good logistics,

14:43.067 --> 14:45.233
you won't make it up here,
I guarantee it.

14:55.800 --> 14:57.967
ANDY:
Very few people know
how to get their food,

14:58.000 --> 15:00.100
or how to take care
of their basic needs in life,

15:00.133 --> 15:02.067
which are food, shelter,
and clothing.

15:03.667 --> 15:07.033
If you don't have the ability
to do those three things
for yourself,

15:07.067 --> 15:09.533
you're not very well prepared.

15:09.567 --> 15:13.000
Putting up your meat out here
is probably

15:13.033 --> 15:15.767
the most important thing
you can do for the year.

15:15.800 --> 15:20.967
Caribou, bear, and moose
are our primary source
of protein.

15:21.000 --> 15:23.200
So the best thing
that could happen to me
right now

15:23.233 --> 15:24.500
would be to get
a moose real quick.

15:25.833 --> 15:27.633
NARRATOR:
With sunset approaching,

15:27.667 --> 15:29.300
Andy's hopes of
finding the meat

15:29.333 --> 15:33.467
he and Kate need to survive
the winter are fading fast.

15:33.500 --> 15:36.133
ANDY: These sloughs
are really good hunting areas,

15:36.167 --> 15:38.400
because they tend to be
full of water

15:38.433 --> 15:40.833
and very nutritious food
for the moose.

15:43.833 --> 15:46.133
Young bull just came out.

15:46.167 --> 15:48.767
He's a little too far away
for a clear shot.

15:48.800 --> 15:50.267
Moose have great hearing,

15:50.300 --> 15:53.933
so silence is
absolutely necessary
when you're stalking a moose.

16:07.800 --> 16:10.067
(WHISPERS) It's really,
really wet down there.

16:10.100 --> 16:13.233
I'm hoping I can call him
out of that wet body area,

16:13.267 --> 16:16.300
'cause that'll be
a pain in the butt
to shoot him right there.

16:18.800 --> 16:21.067
(MIMICS MOOSE CALL)

16:23.033 --> 16:24.933
It's getting
a little bit dark.

16:24.967 --> 16:27.633
I've got a good clear shot
at him, but he's in water.

16:27.667 --> 16:29.567
I'd really rather
not shoot him right now,

16:29.600 --> 16:32.167
but I'm not gonna be able
to wait too much longer.

16:34.767 --> 16:35.767
(SPLASHES)

16:51.133 --> 16:54.333
(SIGHS) I should've fucking
waited a little longer.

16:54.367 --> 16:56.633
This moose is gonna be
a pain in the ass to get out.

16:56.667 --> 16:58.167
He's three feet in the water

16:58.200 --> 17:00.367
and 30 yards
out into a slough,

17:01.333 --> 17:04.200
but he's down,
and that's good.

17:04.233 --> 17:05.767
So I'm gonna head on back.

17:05.800 --> 17:09.200
Get him butchered up tonight,
and then try and get him
outta here tomorrow.

17:11.567 --> 17:14.400
Life is very physical
when you live out in the bush,

17:14.433 --> 17:18.567
and if you're not willing to
put in the physical activity
out here,

17:18.600 --> 17:21.033
you're not gonna do very well
out here in the long run.

17:23.167 --> 17:24.167
(ANDY SPEAKING)

17:35.200 --> 17:38.433
I'm gonna have to get
a winch in here
to get him out of that water.

17:38.467 --> 17:40.233
So I'm gonna go back,
get Kate,

17:40.267 --> 17:42.733
and looks like
got a long night
ahead of us here.

17:49.833 --> 17:52.333
CHIP: If somebody gives you
something, you always give 'em
something back.

17:52.367 --> 17:53.700
No matter what.

17:53.733 --> 17:54.867
There's always a return.

18:08.100 --> 18:09.833
(DRILLING)

18:11.433 --> 18:13.467
NARRATOR: Chip's recycling
an old oil drum

18:13.500 --> 18:15.200
to make a portable wood stove

18:15.233 --> 18:18.333
he can use for warmth during
the brutal cold months ahead.

18:22.067 --> 18:24.133
There you go.

18:24.167 --> 18:26.633
It's really important
that you be able to do
for yourself up here.

18:26.667 --> 18:28.633
There's no point in me trying
to earn money

18:28.667 --> 18:31.200
to get myself a new stove
when I could just make one.

18:35.833 --> 18:37.300
So right here
I've got my doorway.

18:41.533 --> 18:43.000
You ain't got something,
and you want it,

18:43.033 --> 18:44.967
you gotta make it yourself
or do without.

18:47.167 --> 18:50.567
All the materials are
coming right off this drum.

18:50.600 --> 18:53.800
I'm folding the edges
of the door so nobody gets cut
when we're using this thing,

18:53.833 --> 18:56.233
and so that when
it's in my sled
and I pack stuff,

18:56.267 --> 18:57.667
it's not gonna
slice my gear up.

18:57.700 --> 19:00.733
This is no place to do things
half-assed. Nope.

19:09.967 --> 19:13.033
This piece I'm putting on
right now is the door hatch.

19:13.067 --> 19:15.233
So this'll let the door open
and close.

19:16.967 --> 19:18.667
It's stiff enough.

19:18.700 --> 19:20.633
It'll stay up when you open
the door... (WHOOSHES)

19:20.667 --> 19:22.767
Or more like that.

19:22.800 --> 19:25.867
Probably that way.
Open up, close, latch.

19:28.100 --> 19:29.233
Put your wood in.

19:29.267 --> 19:31.900
Over here you got a big enough
area for a frying pan.

19:31.933 --> 19:33.867
Right there you got
a big enough area
for a coffee pot.

19:34.767 --> 19:37.867
Right there, Grant stove.

19:37.900 --> 19:40.300
And to think, I got a drum
with a piece of caribou,

19:40.333 --> 19:42.100
and now I have a stove,

19:42.133 --> 19:43.933
and what sets this stove apart
from others is,

19:43.967 --> 19:46.300
you live in a tent
and you plan on being mobile,

19:46.333 --> 19:47.967
you don't wanna carry
the ashes with you.

19:48.000 --> 19:49.733
You wanna make everything
as light as possible.

19:49.767 --> 19:53.200
Possessions are a burden
when you live out of
a snow machine and a sled.

19:53.233 --> 19:55.867
So when we're done,
we take our pipes off.

19:55.900 --> 19:58.633
We'll make 'em be able
to fit inside of this.

19:58.667 --> 19:59.833
We'll probably have
three of 'em.

19:59.867 --> 20:01.633
They'll fit inside there,

20:01.667 --> 20:03.567
and then when we're done,
and we're getting on,

20:03.600 --> 20:05.200
we leave the ashes behind.

20:05.233 --> 20:06.867
It's very light.

20:06.900 --> 20:08.600
We'll put that in our sled.

20:08.633 --> 20:10.233
ERIK: There's a lot of
nonsense that goes around,

20:10.267 --> 20:12.833
and people think these bears
are cuddly creatures,

20:12.867 --> 20:15.200
but out there in nature,
you know,

20:15.233 --> 20:17.233
they kill each other
and they eat each other.

20:27.767 --> 20:31.667
NARRATOR: Erik's going after
one of Alaska's
most challenging kills,

20:31.700 --> 20:33.167
a mountain goat.

20:34.333 --> 20:36.700
Just about to start ascending
the mountain.

20:36.733 --> 20:39.033
Looks like three goats
came around the corner.

20:40.267 --> 20:43.233
Four goats, five goats.
That's a good omen.

20:43.267 --> 20:44.900
I'm happy they showed
themselves there,

20:44.933 --> 20:47.867
'cause I was about to head
around the other side
of the mountain.

20:47.900 --> 20:49.967
Might've saved me
a couple miles walking.

20:50.000 --> 20:53.400
I think I'm at about 700 foot
above sea level right now,

20:53.433 --> 20:55.133
and I think those goats are...

20:55.167 --> 20:59.533
Are maybe another good
2,500-2,800 feet above me.

20:59.567 --> 21:02.800
So that's probably
a 2,800 or 3,000 foot peak.

21:03.333 --> 21:04.433
Let's climb up.

21:04.467 --> 21:05.900
We can count our steps
and figure it out.

21:13.967 --> 21:16.133
As we work our way up
the valley here, you know,

21:16.167 --> 21:19.133
you can see each of the little
side drainages,

21:19.167 --> 21:21.600
and there's a lot of places
for animals to hide.

21:27.833 --> 21:29.600
Holy shit.

21:29.633 --> 21:34.633
A sow and two cubs coming down
the valley towards us here,
just dropping into the alders.

21:36.367 --> 21:40.167
We're kind of wedged
in between this canyon
down here,

21:40.200 --> 21:42.233
of fast-moving water...

21:45.467 --> 21:48.233
And a sow
and two cubs up there.

21:48.267 --> 21:49.267
Sort of dangerous.

21:51.167 --> 21:55.933
NARRATOR: Grizzly bears
only produce up to eight cubs
in a lifetime.

21:55.967 --> 21:59.500
The mothers are
highly protective
and extremely aggressive.

22:02.933 --> 22:04.533
ERIK: They're not that fun
to play with

22:04.567 --> 22:07.000
when you're out on a hillside
by yourself.

22:07.033 --> 22:08.733
I'd personally prefer
to move along.

22:19.967 --> 22:21.167
Let's get out of here.

22:21.200 --> 22:24.467
Sow with two first-year cubs,
they're a handful.

22:24.500 --> 22:28.000
NARRATOR: Erik can't risk
attracting the attention
of the sow.

22:28.033 --> 22:29.667
He'll have to take
a safer path

22:29.700 --> 22:31.400
to get to the goats
he's after.

22:44.833 --> 22:45.967
That's no good.

22:51.967 --> 22:53.067
The goats can do it.

23:03.300 --> 23:05.367
I don't know how far away
we are from the goats,

23:05.400 --> 23:07.633
but we're close enough now
that the hunt's on.

23:08.700 --> 23:10.000
(PANTING)

23:10.033 --> 23:11.533
Breathing pretty hard,

23:11.567 --> 23:13.333
busting alder coming up
this mountain,

23:13.367 --> 23:15.300
but getting excited now.

23:16.033 --> 23:17.233
We're getting close.

23:18.267 --> 23:21.367
I just hope there's
a nice one in the bunch.

23:23.700 --> 23:25.100
ANDY: Every year's
a little bit different.

23:25.133 --> 23:26.800
Some years
you work your ass off,

23:28.933 --> 23:31.467
some years you just
skate right on through.

23:37.967 --> 23:40.233
Just pull that over
and put that on.

23:40.267 --> 23:41.367
It can't fit.

23:41.400 --> 23:44.067
ANDY: Well, stop eating
lasagne, then.

23:44.500 --> 23:45.567
(LAUGHS)

23:45.600 --> 23:47.067
Bite me, mother-fucker.

23:47.100 --> 23:48.633
How much more
do I have to carry?

23:50.267 --> 23:51.467
(GRUNTS)

23:51.500 --> 23:53.467
(KATE SPEAKING)

23:53.500 --> 23:55.400
ANDY: No shit.
That's why I got a rifle.

23:55.433 --> 23:57.100
There's a lot of bears
around here.

23:58.900 --> 24:01.367
There's always a chance
that other predators,

24:01.400 --> 24:05.133
black bear or grizzly,
are gonna smell this
and come in.

24:05.167 --> 24:08.433
Building a fire will provide
protection from wildlife

24:08.467 --> 24:11.100
that might be coming in
to steal our meat.

24:13.733 --> 24:15.200
It's not going to blow up
on you.

24:16.433 --> 24:18.767
Whoa! (LAUGHS)

24:24.500 --> 24:26.300
Okay. It's right there.

24:40.000 --> 24:41.933
All right.
Let's see if that works.

24:44.133 --> 24:45.967
I'm going to get
a chainsaw winch,

24:46.000 --> 24:48.400
tie it up to a tree
up on the bank,

24:48.433 --> 24:52.333
and drag him out
on to some dry ground
to get this guy field dressed.

24:52.367 --> 24:54.533
(CHAINSAW WHIRRING)

25:07.233 --> 25:10.267
I'm not opposed to technology.
I utilise it a lot.

25:10.300 --> 25:12.467
I have a lot of tools
and a lot of equipment here.

25:12.500 --> 25:15.067
If you're going to work
by yourself, you need aid.

25:18.033 --> 25:20.533
This is probably
one of the best tools
you'll ever have

25:20.567 --> 25:22.667
if you live out in the bush.

25:22.700 --> 25:26.267
The reason why I still
have a back is
because of this tool.

25:28.300 --> 25:29.300
(KATE SPEAKING)

25:33.733 --> 25:36.233
ANDY: That job's done.
Now comes the bloody part.

25:40.933 --> 25:43.167
I can honestly say
I've never done one like this.

25:43.200 --> 25:44.267
KATE: I know.

25:45.833 --> 25:48.900
Most important thing right now
is to get these guts
out of the moose

25:48.933 --> 25:50.733
so it doesn't spoil the meat.

25:55.033 --> 25:56.800
I'm taking the heart out
right now.

26:08.367 --> 26:09.700
KATE: It's a big liver.

26:09.733 --> 26:11.100
ANDY: It's heavy.

26:13.567 --> 26:16.600
There's just a lot of fat
in this moose, which is great

26:16.633 --> 26:19.633
'cause that's what you need
in the wintertime up here,
is fat.

26:20.633 --> 26:22.667
Gut fat's the sweet fat.

26:22.700 --> 26:23.833
(KATE SPEAKING)

26:25.467 --> 26:28.833
Normally when I butcher
a moose
I completely skin them,

26:28.867 --> 26:31.733
I take off the front shoulder,
I take off the hindquarter,

26:31.767 --> 26:34.400
and then the last thing I do
is open him up.

26:34.433 --> 26:36.667
I'm not used to
just cutting the quarters

26:36.700 --> 26:38.933
with the skin still on them
and everything,

26:38.967 --> 26:41.867
and so it's just doing it
a little bit differently.

26:41.900 --> 26:44.200
I'm doing it this way
because it's late

26:44.233 --> 26:47.867
and we just want to
get this thing cooled down,

26:47.900 --> 26:50.633
and we'll come back
and deal with him
when we're not tired.

26:52.000 --> 26:53.200
Here's a kidney.

26:53.233 --> 26:54.267
KATE: Do you want to
put that in

26:54.300 --> 26:55.433
-with the fat?
-Yep.

26:55.467 --> 26:56.467
KATE: Okay.

26:57.967 --> 26:59.733
ANDY: The guts are out.
That's the main thing.

26:59.767 --> 27:02.667
He's cooling off,
you can see all the steam
rising off of him.

27:02.700 --> 27:04.633
I think we'll just leave him
like this for tonight

27:04.667 --> 27:07.367
and we'll come back
and deal with him
in the light tomorrow,

27:07.400 --> 27:09.100
when we can really see
what we're doing.

27:17.500 --> 27:20.400
SUE: In life,
the minute you stop learning,
you start dying.

27:21.967 --> 27:23.867
Whole damn thing's
a learning experience.

27:33.533 --> 27:36.467
NARRATOR: At its best,
Kavik River Camp is remote,

27:36.500 --> 27:39.133
but in winter,
it becomes a desolate outpost

27:39.167 --> 27:42.967
where Sue relies almost
entirely on the fruits
of her fall labours.

27:43.700 --> 27:45.500
With one caribou down,

27:45.533 --> 27:49.467
she's got one last chance
to double her precious
reserves of fresh meat.

27:55.833 --> 27:59.033
SUE: Walking in the water,
my pants are
about falling off.

28:09.000 --> 28:11.933
It's really fucking hard
to get across the tundra
without being seen.

28:29.300 --> 28:31.033
I'm just gonna have to
keep going.

29:04.200 --> 29:05.667
All right, little caribou.

29:06.700 --> 29:08.767
Well, I got him.

29:08.800 --> 29:11.900
Caribou number two,
double trouble, nice boy.

29:13.033 --> 29:14.400
Well, buddy.

29:15.733 --> 29:17.167
There's something for you.

29:18.367 --> 29:19.633
Thank you very much.

29:22.200 --> 29:25.933
I collect little rocks that,
to me, have a heart shape

29:25.967 --> 29:29.367
because I don't think
a life should ever
be taken lightly.

29:31.600 --> 29:35.300
That animal was alive
and breathing and had a spirit
and a lot of energy.

29:35.333 --> 29:39.133
But this animal
gave up its life
so I can survive this winter.

29:39.167 --> 29:42.167
And I'm saying,
"Thank you, buddy.
My heart to yours."

29:45.500 --> 29:46.767
Now the hard work begins.

29:48.733 --> 29:51.300
I'm just gonna quarter him up,
get what I can.

29:52.667 --> 29:54.267
I am proud of myself.

29:54.300 --> 29:57.333
I mean, let's face it,
I'm an overweight grandma

29:57.367 --> 29:59.833
living 500 miles from anybody,

29:59.867 --> 30:03.033
and at 50,
I'm still doing a good job
at feeding myself,

30:03.067 --> 30:06.200
clothing myself,
and maintaining
a pretty decent attitude.

30:19.633 --> 30:22.200
Well, time for me
to get going on this dude.

30:22.233 --> 30:25.267
It was a two-fer,
and I'm awful wet
and I'm awful cold.

30:25.300 --> 30:27.500
It's getting late,
so I gotta get this guy...

30:28.100 --> 30:29.433
Gotta get this guy done.

30:33.000 --> 30:36.033
These are some mature,
full-bodied bulls.

30:36.067 --> 30:37.100
You know, I'm gonna get

30:37.133 --> 30:39.167
100, 120 pounds of meat
off him.

30:39.200 --> 30:40.333
So that's gonna cover me
for a while.

30:40.367 --> 30:43.033
I'll see how full
my little freezie is,

30:43.067 --> 30:45.367

back down to the quad...

30:46.767 --> 30:48.667
And I'm a set chick
for winter.

30:54.800 --> 30:57.800
I don't see how you can get
tired of all this vista.

30:59.000 --> 31:03.233
I got mountains with snow,
rivers with fish.

31:03.267 --> 31:05.800
It's not a life for everybody,
but I don't get tired.

31:05.833 --> 31:08.900
I got a 360-degree TV.

a big shift,
since the '90s especially.

that are graduating

aren't gonna live like this.

(DOGS BARKING)

31:37.600 --> 31:40.500
I was able to take
a leg of caribou
and trade it for an old drum,

31:40.533 --> 31:43.067
'cause I didn't want to ruin
my good drums.

31:43.100 --> 31:47.300
But I got a recyclable one
and my friend got food.

31:47.333 --> 31:50.000
The first time
we want to stoke it and make
the whole thing really hot

31:50.033 --> 31:52.967
so we can get rid
of any kind of stove oil
or gasoline

31:53.000 --> 31:55.533
that may be still
sitting inside the steel.

31:55.567 --> 31:58.233
It's kind of
a way of cleaning it,
cleaning it with fire.

31:58.267 --> 31:59.800
We're gonna build this sucker
really hot.

31:59.833 --> 32:01.067
I'm gonna go in the house
and go get some water,

32:01.100 --> 32:02.233
and then I'm gonna get a tub,

32:02.267 --> 32:03.900
I'm gonna get
my traps that I have.

32:03.933 --> 32:05.767
And we're gonna make sure
this baby burns.

32:09.000 --> 32:10.267
I'm heating water

32:10.300 --> 32:13.233
so I can boil my new traps.

32:13.267 --> 32:17.633
Last spring when I was done
trapping for wolverine,
foxes, lynx, and stuff,

32:17.667 --> 32:21.267
I gave my oldest son
my trap set.

32:21.300 --> 32:22.667
My whole outfit.

32:26.500 --> 32:29.433
Kinda look on the tops
and see some of the oils
coming off of them.

32:29.467 --> 32:32.333
These all have a preservative
on them to keep the steel
from rusting

32:32.367 --> 32:34.867
while they're in the shop,
or in a store,

32:34.900 --> 32:37.533
and the animals
can smell that,
so we boil it off.

32:37.567 --> 32:39.233
Now we're seasoning the stove,

32:39.933 --> 32:41.133
we'll season the traps.

32:41.167 --> 32:43.633
They're gonna sit here
for about half hour,
45 minutes,

32:43.667 --> 32:44.967
we'll take them out,
we'll rinse them.

32:46.667 --> 32:48.167
Hey, baby.

32:48.200 --> 32:50.167
Come here,
check out what I'm doing.
I'll show you something.

32:51.433 --> 32:53.333
This is my new stove
I made last night.

32:53.367 --> 32:54.667
All new traps.

32:54.700 --> 32:56.067
Not bad, huh?

32:56.100 --> 32:57.700
But they got wax all over them

32:58.433 --> 33:00.033
so we pour it off.

33:03.133 --> 33:05.167
Now, without touching 'em,
I'm gonna hang 'em up.

33:05.200 --> 33:06.567
And you'll do me a favour?

33:06.600 --> 33:08.200
Don't let nobody touch 'em.

33:08.233 --> 33:10.400
Cause if they touch 'em,
what's the animal gonna smell?

33:10.433 --> 33:11.767
Gonna smell the person,
ain't he?

33:11.800 --> 33:13.167
And then they'll know
it's a trap.

33:13.600 --> 33:14.967
So...

33:15.000 --> 33:16.267
Now that we got
all the wax off,

33:16.300 --> 33:18.533
we'll let them dry,
let them rust up a little bit.

ERIK: I still learn things
every time I go out,

33:41.200 --> 33:43.133
but the bottom line is,
here in nature,

33:43.933 --> 33:45.233
it's kill or be killed.

33:53.867 --> 33:55.767
I saw four goats now.

33:55.800 --> 33:57.067
I saw six earlier.

33:57.100 --> 33:58.967
I assume the other ones
are just over the edge.

33:59.000 --> 34:01.533
They're still a long ways away
and a big vertical climb.

34:03.533 --> 34:06.033

sitting on the side
of a mountain

34:06.067 --> 34:07.900

on the tundra down below us.

34:10.367 --> 34:11.967
What can go wrong?
Life is good.

34:12.000 --> 34:13.367
I'm gonna bite my lip

34:13.400 --> 34:16.400
and see if I can't grind out
another thousand
vertical feet.

34:20.967 --> 34:23.800

almost impenetrable alder.

34:24.467 --> 34:26.733
Alder's thick stuff.

34:26.767 --> 34:29.867
Hard work climbing uphill
through alder.

34:29.900 --> 34:30.967
That's goat country, though.

34:48.833 --> 34:50.233
We made it to the alpine.

34:51.300 --> 34:53.333
Vegetation's really
changed here.

34:53.367 --> 34:55.733
Should be a little bit
easier walking.
Not busting brush.

34:56.367 --> 34:57.467
Just keep on keeping on.

35:18.733 --> 35:21.633
We've climbed more than
two thirds of the way up.

35:21.667 --> 35:22.900
It's been a good haul.

35:22.933 --> 35:25.333
Just hoping the goats
are still there
when I get there.

35:26.333 --> 35:27.967
There's a halfway decent one.

35:37.367 --> 35:40.933

take a much closer look at
what I'm working with.

real steep slopes here.

35:54.433 --> 35:55.667

36:05.567 --> 36:07.733
I gotta get down
right against the ground

where it's blowing so hard,

36:48.900 --> 36:52.267
and it's so cold, I want to
get my rain gear on,

get some protection
from this wind.

36:53.933 --> 36:55.933
I am going to be here
for a while
butchering this goat.

36:58.033 --> 36:59.167
I'm so pumped about this.

36:59.200 --> 37:01.667
He's got really thick,
thick fur.

37:02.667 --> 37:07.300
You know,
it's just a beautiful animal.

37:07.333 --> 37:08.933
Absolutely beautiful animal.

37:13.900 --> 37:18.200
I have to say
this is the most extreme wind
I've ever butchered anything.

37:23.267 --> 37:26.000
There aren't goats
in the part of Alaska
where I live.

37:28.967 --> 37:31.867
This is the first goat
I've actually shot myself,
personally.

37:33.400 --> 37:35.233

of the goat here.

37:54.933 --> 37:57.167
I am loading it up
into this game bag.

37:57.200 --> 37:58.800
I kept the meat on the bone,

37:58.833 --> 38:01.267
which keeps it in
much better condition.

38:01.300 --> 38:03.433
Fortunate to get the goat here

38:04.333 --> 38:05.933
in kind of a grassy area

38:05.967 --> 38:07.867
where all the meat
can stay relatively clean.

38:09.167 --> 38:13.067
The wind is what I could
describe as ridiculous.

38:13.100 --> 38:16.833
Enough to make my pack
to be 100 pounds with the meat

38:16.867 --> 38:19.033
and the hide and the skull.

the mountain

38:25.800 --> 38:28.433
could be more treacherous
than the climb.

pretty careful
when you're packing,

in the 100-pound range.

to twist an ankle
or snap a leg

So I found an old toboggan,

Up, up, go.

41:59.767 --> 42:00.933
Come on, let's go!

42:00.967 --> 42:02.767
Attaboys, good dogs.

42:02.800 --> 42:04.200
Up, up, up, straight ahead.

42:04.233 --> 42:06.167
This is a pretty
economical moose.

42:06.200 --> 42:07.433
He's cost me one bullet,

42:07.467 --> 42:09.033
a couple gallons of gas

42:09.067 --> 42:12.233
and that's gonna be protein
and meat for us
for a whole year.

42:14.433 --> 42:17.167
So the moose is in the boat,
the dogs did their work.

42:17.200 --> 42:20.500
The Andy-Boggan worked.
So it's been a good day.

42:20.533 --> 42:22.167
It's a long day.
I'm pretty pooped.

42:22.200 --> 42:24.400
But the hardest part's
over, getting them out,

42:24.433 --> 42:27.300
and all we have to do now
is hang them up
in the smokehouse

42:27.333 --> 42:28.700
and we're set for the winter.
