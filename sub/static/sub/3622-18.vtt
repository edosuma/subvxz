ALL:
Mad Dogs here, we can play.

00:09.176 --> 00:11.076
Watch our moves
and you will say:

00:11.078 --> 00:12.644
♪ Go, Mad Dogs

00:17.952 --> 00:19.151
Hey!

00:19.153 --> 00:20.619
Uh, Bonnie, you missed your cue

00:20.621 --> 00:22.988
to back-flip hurky spring
into the pyramid.

00:22.990 --> 00:24.957
Uh, Kim,
if you don't jump first,

00:24.959 --> 00:26.291
how can I be on top?

00:26.293 --> 00:28.160
For the millionth time, Bonnie,

00:28.162 --> 00:30.029
<i>I'm</i> the top of this pyramid.

00:30.031 --> 00:31.263
Using the back-flip hurky?

00:31.265 --> 00:33.232
No offense, but
that move went out

00:33.234 --> 00:35.567
with the shade of that
dress you're wearing.

00:35.569 --> 00:37.836
Oh. I suppose you have
a better move?

00:37.838 --> 00:38.971
Uh, <i>yeah...</i>

00:38.973 --> 00:40.539
the side-hurdler lift-up.

00:40.541 --> 00:42.107
A little more this century.

00:42.109 --> 00:43.208
( <i>gasps</i> ):

00:43.210 --> 00:44.643
Oh, that sounds great...

of Not Gonna Happen.

00:53.988 --> 00:55.788
Ron, could you maybe
not celebrate

00:55.790 --> 00:57.256
the collapse of our pyramid?

00:57.258 --> 00:59.191
But Mad Dog is
ferociously amped.

00:59.193 --> 01:01.627
Ain't nothin' jammin' up
his positive vibe.

01:01.629 --> 01:03.395

The Middleton cheer squad's
been picked to join the few,

01:11.172 --> 01:13.839
the proud, the peppy.

01:13.841 --> 01:15.641
We're going to cheer camp,

<i>Come on, Ron.</i>

02:35.823 --> 02:38.790
I know you have camp issues,
but this will be fun.

02:38.792 --> 02:41.760
Do not use the words "camp" and
"fun" in the same sentence.

02:41.762 --> 02:43.762
Need I remind you of the horror

02:43.764 --> 02:45.964
<i>of Camp Wannaweep?</i>

02:45.966 --> 02:47.299
What's this plant?

02:47.301 --> 02:48.300
( <i>Ron screams</i>)

02:48.302 --> 02:49.968
Make the itching stop!

02:49.970 --> 02:51.770
( <i>screeches</i> )

02:51.772 --> 02:52.738
( <i>yells</i> )

Leave me alone...

02:54.742 --> 02:56.141
( <i>screams</i> )

02:58.044 --> 03:01.079
I thought you conquered
all your camp-related fears.

03:01.081 --> 03:02.748
I thought so, too. Didn't.

03:02.750 --> 03:05.918
But, Ron, cheer camp isn't
even technically at a camp.

03:05.920 --> 03:07.920
They hold it at Middleton
Community College.

03:07.922 --> 03:10.088
Really? N-No toxic lake?
No.

03:10.090 --> 03:11.290
No spooky woods?
No.

03:11.292 --> 03:12.991
No scary squirrels?
Ron?

03:12.993 --> 03:13.992
What?
Whoa.

03:13.994 --> 03:15.394
O-Okay, okay.

03:15.396 --> 03:17.729
I guess camp at a college
won't haunt my dreams.

03:17.731 --> 03:18.830
That's the spirit.

03:18.832 --> 03:20.098
Look! There it is.

03:21.834 --> 03:22.834
There it goes.

03:22.836 --> 03:24.836
Change of plans, people.

03:24.838 --> 03:26.338
The campus is off-limits,

03:26.340 --> 03:28.941
due to catastrophic
plumbing problems.

03:28.943 --> 03:29.875
So we're going home?

03:29.877 --> 03:31.310
Negative.

03:31.312 --> 03:33.111
We got lucky
and landed an alternate venue.

03:33.113 --> 03:34.379
Upperton University?

03:34.381 --> 03:38.083
Nope. The sunny shores
of Lake Gottagrin.

03:40.153 --> 03:41.753
( <i>laughter</i> ) Here we go!

03:41.755 --> 03:43.121
Come on, Ron.

03:43.123 --> 03:45.357
What better way to erase
the nightmare of Camp Wannaweep

03:45.359 --> 03:47.426
than with a happy visit
to Camp Gottagrin?

03:47.428 --> 03:50.195
Happy? I like happy.

03:50.197 --> 03:51.230
Maybe you're right.

03:51.232 --> 03:52.731
This could be good for me.

03:52.733 --> 03:54.833
I'm gonna be happy... Aah!

03:57.104 --> 04:03.041
( <i>dramatic music plays</i>) This is
the same lake, the same lake!

04:03.043 --> 04:06.044
Have I been put on this earth
to suffer?

04:06.046 --> 04:07.312
Um, uh, could you cut the music?

04:07.314 --> 04:08.447
I'm stressing here.

04:08.449 --> 04:10.782
Uh, isn't this band camp?

04:10.784 --> 04:12.251
RON:
No. That's band camp,

04:12.253 --> 04:14.319
right next
to telecommunications camp,

04:14.321 --> 04:15.887
which is right next
to clown camp,

04:15.889 --> 04:18.523
right next to science camp,
also known as the camp

04:18.525 --> 04:20.525
whose toxic runoff
has polluted the lake

04:20.527 --> 04:22.961
and will turn everyone
into amphibious mutants!

04:22.963 --> 04:24.363
Ron, stop wigging.

04:24.365 --> 04:26.298
Let's get some down-low.

04:26.300 --> 04:28.367
According to my toxicology scan,

04:28.369 --> 04:31.203
the water in Lake Gottagrin
is uncontaminated.

04:31.205 --> 04:32.838
See? The lake's
totally detoxed.

04:32.840 --> 04:34.139
Look.

04:34.141 --> 04:35.040
Busy little beavers.

04:35.042 --> 04:36.308
Not a mutant in the bunch.

04:36.310 --> 04:38.343
You can take the evil
out of the lake,

04:38.345 --> 04:40.846
but you can never take
the lake out of the evil.

04:40.848 --> 04:42.347
Ron, that so doesn't
even make sense.

04:42.349 --> 04:44.383
Doesn't it, Kim, doesn't it?!

04:46.486 --> 04:47.953
Aah! Hey, guys,

04:47.955 --> 04:50.255
it's the Middleton Mad Dog
in the flesh!

04:50.257 --> 04:52.457
Your moves are killer, dude!

04:52.459 --> 04:55.160
Oh, give us a taste
of that Mad Dog howl.

04:55.162 --> 04:57.095
Ron, you can do this.

04:57.097 --> 04:58.497
Mad Dog can do this.

04:58.499 --> 05:00.399
Okay. For the squad.

05:02.435 --> 05:05.103
( <i>howls and growls</i> )

05:05.105 --> 05:06.271
Whoa! Whoa, Mad Dog!

05:06.273 --> 05:08.340
You're getting foam in my gill.

05:08.342 --> 05:11.410
( <i>echoing</i> ):
<i>Gill, gill, gill...</i>

05:11.412 --> 05:12.978
Remember me?

05:12.980 --> 05:14.579
Not really,
and I got to tell you,

05:14.581 --> 05:15.881
I think I'd remember.

05:15.883 --> 05:17.849
Oh, come on, Ronnie, think.
Gil?

05:17.851 --> 05:18.950
I am no longer Gil.

05:18.952 --> 05:20.118
Now I am Gill!

05:20.120 --> 05:21.520
Uh, what's the difference?

05:21.522 --> 05:22.888
I added an "L."

05:22.890 --> 05:27.392
<i>As in fish things</i>
<i>that grew when I mutated?</i>

05:29.929 --> 05:31.229
You can't win, Ronnie.

05:31.231 --> 05:34.266
This is my element.

05:34.268 --> 05:36.468
Sorry to bother you,
Dr. Lurkin.

05:36.470 --> 05:39.304
I just wanted to check
on a patient... Gill...

05:39.306 --> 05:41.840
You know...
G-I-double-L,

05:41.842 --> 05:43.342
the mutant spelling?

05:43.344 --> 05:45.277
Oh, golly, no,
it's one "L" again.

05:45.279 --> 05:46.878
He's quite a success story.

05:46.880 --> 05:48.380
100% human.

05:48.382 --> 05:50.082
Even made the honor roll.

05:50.084 --> 05:51.883
Where? At Mutant High?

05:51.885 --> 05:53.285
Oh, no, it's a public school.

05:53.287 --> 05:54.920
He's adjusted quite well.

05:54.922 --> 05:56.988
Busy with
extracurricular activities.

05:56.990 --> 05:58.223
Inter-mutant swim team?

05:58.225 --> 06:00.325
No. I believe
he's on the football team.

06:00.327 --> 06:02.494
Uh, he's... well, uh,
what do they call it?

06:02.496 --> 06:04.162
Uh... mascot.

Aah! Kim! Rufus!
He's got me!

06:11.271 --> 06:14.272
You bet I do! Noogie!

06:14.274 --> 06:15.440
Hi, Kim.
Can you believe it?

06:15.442 --> 06:17.175
Ronnie and I are going
to be roommates,

06:17.177 --> 06:18.377
just like old times.

06:18.379 --> 06:19.878
Am I mutating?

06:19.880 --> 06:22.481
D-Do you see any webbing,
scales, funky lips?

06:22.483 --> 06:24.583
Try to keep an open mind.
People can change.

06:24.585 --> 06:26.551
That's what I'm afraid of.

06:26.553 --> 06:29.087
Uh-oh! I think I feel
a fork in my tongue.

06:31.491 --> 06:34.426
Oh, you have got to be kidding.

We're... roommates?

06:36.530 --> 06:39.264
No way. Cabin nine?

06:39.266 --> 06:42.167
Cabin nine.
Okay, we have to deal.

06:42.169 --> 06:44.503
Good. While you're dealing,
I'm claiming the top bunk.

06:44.505 --> 06:46.171
I wanted the top bunk.

06:46.173 --> 06:48.540
Knew you would, but it's like

I have some cover-up
that'll help conceal

07:30.284 --> 07:32.150
those monstrous bags
under your eyes.

07:32.152 --> 07:33.652
Wouldn't have bags

High Cheer Squad onstage,

I've got a <i>way</i> fantastic
announcement.

Let me hear you say yeah!

07:58.312 --> 08:00.011
Might as well
give it to me now.

08:00.013 --> 08:02.714
Yeah... if it's for
mad snore skills.

you needed help.

Oh. Yeah. Thanks, Gil.

Hey, where's your outfit?

Oh, I want it to be a surprise.

thing number five:

08:15.596 --> 08:17.295
just because I'm paranoid

08:17.297 --> 08:19.097
doesn't mean Gil
isn't out to get me.

08:20.601 --> 08:23.635
Aw, you're tired.

top spot on the pyramid.

08:45.125 --> 08:47.325
Aw, hang in there, camper.

08:53.432 --> 08:56.167
That's stick's not really
made of gold, is it?

08:56.169 --> 08:57.802
Gold plastic, but it's not
what the Spirit Stick

08:57.804 --> 08:59.271
is made out of, Ron.

08:59.273 --> 09:00.205
It is what it represents.

09:00.207 --> 09:01.139
What's that?

09:01.141 --> 09:02.741
That Bonnie can't have it.

09:02.743 --> 09:04.609
At least you can prove your
roommate is up to no good.

09:04.611 --> 09:05.610
Yo, Ronnie.

09:05.612 --> 09:06.745
We're smores outside.

09:06.747 --> 09:08.480
Try one.
I added a special ingredient.

09:08.482 --> 09:11.182
Hey, hey, thanks, roomie.

09:11.184 --> 09:12.551
You rock.

09:14.754 --> 09:16.755
( <i>chatters</i> ):
Smore?

09:16.757 --> 09:18.456
Hey!

09:20.560 --> 09:21.560
What are you doing?

09:21.562 --> 09:23.194
Special ingredient?

09:23.196 --> 09:25.196
Special mutating ingredient.

09:25.198 --> 09:28.066
So wrong. I'm the one
with the evil roomie here.

09:29.435 --> 09:30.735
I got go.

09:30.737 --> 09:34.139
I'm keeping my friends close
and my enemies closer.

09:34.141 --> 09:35.373
Hey, Gil, wait up.

09:35.375 --> 09:37.709
( <i>chirping</i> )

( <i>snoring</i> )

09:40.514 --> 09:42.547
( <i>door closes</i>)

09:43.749 --> 09:46.284
The game's afoot, Rufus.

09:46.819 --> 09:48.687
( <i>yells</i> )

09:51.791 --> 09:54.426
<i>Frog Fancy.</i>
<i>Suspicious thing number 22.</i>

09:56.629 --> 09:59.731
Mm, suspicious thing number 23.

10:07.540 --> 10:08.440
Oh, no.

10:08.442 --> 10:10.241
I think we lost him.

10:10.243 --> 10:12.744
He could be anywhere.

10:12.746 --> 10:14.346
Stay close, Rufus.

10:14.348 --> 10:16.848
Wannaweep is a dangerous
and cursed place.

10:16.850 --> 10:19.184
( <i>chattering</i> )

10:19.186 --> 10:20.452
It's a mutant footprint.

10:20.454 --> 10:21.453
And it's fresh.

10:22.588 --> 10:25.323
( <i>snoring</i> )

10:30.763 --> 10:33.331
( <i>beeping</i> )

10:37.303 --> 10:39.437
Kim!

10:39.439 --> 10:40.905
You know, Bonnie,

10:40.907 --> 10:43.475
the path to the Spirit Stick
isn't paved with tardiness.

10:43.477 --> 10:46.411
I'm tardy because you
unplugged my alarm clock.

10:46.413 --> 10:48.546
( <i>gasps</i> ):
Is that what that clock was?

10:48.548 --> 10:50.849
Kim, Gill's an
evil mutant again.

10:50.851 --> 10:51.816
Look, I have evidence.

10:51.818 --> 10:52.917
A magazine?

10:52.919 --> 10:54.152
And I saw a footprint.

10:54.154 --> 10:55.286
Uh, freak-o.

10:55.288 --> 10:56.921
Yes, a freaky footprint.

10:56.923 --> 10:58.923
Look, Ron,
I think before you accuse,

10:58.925 --> 11:00.125
you need actual proof.

11:03.996 --> 11:04.929
You want proof.

11:04.931 --> 11:06.798
You can't handle the proof!

11:06.800 --> 11:09.401
( <i>whistling</i> )

11:18.744 --> 11:20.712
Attention, happy campers!

11:20.714 --> 11:22.280
Remain calm,

11:22.282 --> 11:24.582
but there is a mutant among us!

11:24.584 --> 11:25.583
Behold...

11:25.585 --> 11:27.419
the muck monster.

11:29.588 --> 11:31.189
Dude, what's your damage?

11:31.191 --> 11:32.924
I wanted to surprise everyone
with my mascot outfit.

11:32.926 --> 11:34.659
Outfit? Wait, I...

11:34.661 --> 11:36.861
Yeah, my school's team
is the Brookdale Horned Toads.

11:36.863 --> 11:39.364
But, but, you snuck out
last night.

11:39.366 --> 11:41.199
Yeah, to pick up my costume.
What'd you do?

11:41.201 --> 11:42.434
Follow me or something?

11:43.436 --> 11:45.437
Follow? Well, I...
I wouldn't say followed,

11:45.439 --> 11:47.872
'cause that sounds, you know,
paranoid and suspicious.

11:47.874 --> 11:49.774
Loo... hoo... ser.

11:49.776 --> 11:53.411
Hey, Mad Dog, why don't you
roll over and play dead?

11:53.413 --> 11:56.548
ALL ( <i>chanting</i> ):
Loser! Loser! Loser!

12:04.890 --> 12:07.459
( <i>soft sighs</i> )

12:09.228 --> 12:10.528
What is it?
What's happening?

12:10.530 --> 12:12.831
Oh, I'm just
evening out my tan.

12:12.833 --> 12:13.832
Hope I didn't wake you.

12:13.834 --> 12:15.800
( <i>groans</i> )

12:15.802 --> 12:17.335
( <i>Kim humming</i>)

12:17.337 --> 12:18.837
( <i>teeth clicking</i> )

12:18.839 --> 12:20.705
All yours, roomie.

12:33.753 --> 12:34.619
( <i>screams</i> )

12:34.621 --> 12:36.254
Kim!

12:36.256 --> 12:39.624
Oops. Did I use up
all the hot water <i>again?</i>

12:39.626 --> 12:41.392
( <i>chuckles</i> )

12:41.394 --> 12:43.495
Hey, better hurry up or you'll
be late for cheer practice.

12:43.497 --> 12:44.963
Your wasting your time, Kim.

12:44.965 --> 12:46.664
I'm not going to break.

12:46.666 --> 12:49.801
Well, I'm not
going to break, either.

12:49.803 --> 12:52.437
So just because
I'm a little paranoid,

12:52.439 --> 12:54.606
the entire camp's out to get me.

12:54.608 --> 12:56.741
And, you know,
you'd think at some point

12:56.743 --> 12:58.910
they'd run out of rotten
vegetables to pelt me with.

12:58.912 --> 13:02.647
ALL ( <i>chanting</i> ):
Loser! Loser! Loser!

13:07.019 --> 13:08.052
Communicator?

13:08.054 --> 13:09.921
( <i>beeping</i> )

13:09.923 --> 13:11.556
Hey, Wade, what's the sitch?

13:11.558 --> 13:12.791
WADE:
Wannaweep update.

13:12.793 --> 13:15.026
The lake is clean,
but I scanned wider

13:15.028 --> 13:17.929
and found a small grotto
up the south shore.

13:17.931 --> 13:19.497
Grotto. Always hated that word.

13:19.499 --> 13:20.865
It's showing
some weird readings.

13:20.867 --> 13:21.900
How weird?

13:21.902 --> 13:23.034
Evil mutant weird.

13:23.036 --> 13:24.636
I knew it.

13:24.638 --> 13:26.337
We got to find Kim.
You she'll believe.

13:26.339 --> 13:27.705
Hold up.
I'm getting some static.

13:27.707 --> 13:30.375
Looks like it's coming from
telecommunications scan.

13:30.377 --> 13:31.676
I think somebody's trying to...

13:31.678 --> 13:33.444
Wade, wait.
Speak to me.

13:33.446 --> 13:35.713
( <i>whimpering</i> )

13:35.715 --> 13:37.882
Come on, Rufus,
we're heading to the grotto.

13:37.884 --> 13:39.818
Ooh, hate that word.

13:44.056 --> 13:46.057
( <i>groans</i> )

13:46.059 --> 13:47.959
Yep, evil place.

13:52.331 --> 13:55.567
At last, after searching
night after night,

13:55.569 --> 13:57.869
I have found my magic mucka.

13:59.905 --> 14:02.440
Magic mucka?

14:02.442 --> 14:03.508
Sounds worse than grotto.

( <i>bubbling</i> )

14:11.050 --> 14:13.117

14:21.862 --> 14:25.864
( <i>music playing,</i>
<i>people cheering</i> )

14:26.932 --> 14:30.568
Kim, Gill with the two L's
is back.

14:30.570 --> 14:32.670
Ron, got other things
on my mind.

14:32.672 --> 14:36.007
And now, representing
the Brookdale Horned Toads,

14:36.009 --> 14:40.578
let's show our fierce spirit
for Gill Moss.

14:40.580 --> 14:43.948
( <i>growling</i> )

14:43.950 --> 14:46.150
Now, that's a routine.

14:46.152 --> 14:47.619
( <i>cheers</i> )

14:47.621 --> 14:48.920
Don't you screams get it?

14:48.922 --> 14:51.022
This is my revenge.

14:51.024 --> 14:53.892
It starts by turning you all
into my mutant minions.

14:53.894 --> 14:55.026
Oh, sure.

14:55.028 --> 14:57.161
They don't throw fruit at him.

14:57.163 --> 14:59.831
Ah, man!

15:02.935 --> 15:04.702
( <i>growling</i> )

( <i>screaming</i> )

15:07.673 --> 15:09.841
( <i>burping sounds</i> )

15:19.919 --> 15:21.119
Run for it. I'll...

15:21.121 --> 15:22.954
Oh, right. I step aside,
you save the world,

15:22.956 --> 15:25.490
and suddenly you're taking
home the Spirit Stick.

15:25.492 --> 15:26.557
Bonnie,

15:26.559 --> 15:29.027
this so isn't the time for...
look out!

15:29.029 --> 15:30.962
Yuck.

15:30.964 --> 15:34.165
Stoppable, get back
here and save us.

15:34.167 --> 15:36.034
Or, more specifically, me.

15:36.036 --> 15:37.135
( <i>screaming</i> )

15:37.137 --> 15:38.136
Chill, Bonnie.

15:38.138 --> 15:39.871
Ron knows exactly
what he's doing.

15:39.873 --> 15:41.572
I hope.

15:41.574 --> 15:42.941
Please don't be dead.
Please don't be dead.

15:42.943 --> 15:45.043
Please don't be...
( <i>dial tone</i> )

15:45.045 --> 15:46.844
Bingo; dial tone.

15:46.846 --> 15:50.148
That makes the score Ron, one;
double-L Gill, zero.

15:52.451 --> 15:53.751
Okay, so now it's all tied up.

15:53.753 --> 15:55.820
Hello, Squeab.

15:55.822 --> 15:57.021
We meet again.

15:57.023 --> 15:58.122
( <i>laughing</i> )

15:58.124 --> 16:00.158
Whoa, mutant camouflage.

16:00.160 --> 16:01.960
That would be so cool if...

16:01.962 --> 16:03.127
Never mind.

16:03.129 --> 16:05.096
Man, I got to thank you.
Swapping swim time

16:05.098 --> 16:07.198
with arts and crafts
so many years ago,

16:07.200 --> 16:08.599
was the best thing
to ever happen to me.

16:08.601 --> 16:09.834
I thought you hated
being a mutant.

16:09.836 --> 16:11.035
Hence the whole "revenge"
business.

16:11.037 --> 16:12.203
I did hate it,

16:12.205 --> 16:13.805
but once I turned human,
I missed

16:13.807 --> 16:16.841
the immense power that comes
with toxic-genetic mutation.

16:16.843 --> 16:19.043
I guess it's a "grass is always
greener" kind of thing, huh?

16:19.045 --> 16:20.078
Right.

16:20.080 --> 16:21.145
I want it to be greener.

16:21.147 --> 16:22.680
So you sabotage the pipes

16:22.682 --> 16:23.915
of the community college

16:23.917 --> 16:25.984
knowing we'd all be relocated
to Gottagrin.

16:25.986 --> 16:27.752
And now I'm going
to slim the campers

16:27.754 --> 16:29.187
of all the camps
around Lake Wannaweep.

16:29.189 --> 16:30.955
And guess what?
( <i>whimpers</i>)

You're first.

last time.

16:38.198 --> 16:40.264
( <i>grunts and groans</i> )

16:40.266 --> 16:42.133
Bonnie, hand me your nail file.

16:42.135 --> 16:44.068
I can use it
to cut us out of here.

16:44.070 --> 16:46.070
You? You're not getting
all the credit.

16:46.072 --> 16:47.772
I'm cutting us out of here.

For pity sake, not again.

16:57.984 --> 16:59.817
( <i>groans</i> ):
Fine.

16:59.819 --> 17:01.586
Take it already.

17:02.988 --> 17:05.156
( <i>panting</i> )

17:17.002 --> 17:18.169
Let's finish this

17:18.171 --> 17:19.203
so I can go blast the rest

17:19.205 --> 17:20.238
of the camps in peace.

but he couldn't hide.

As of right now,

17:38.892 --> 17:40.758
Ron Stoppable
is all done running.

17:40.760 --> 17:41.993
Yeah.

17:44.229 --> 17:46.597
It's the only way.

matter how many times

you get slimmed
by a genetic mutant,

you never quite get used to it.

18:20.700 --> 18:21.799
We got to find Gill.

18:21.801 --> 18:23.734
Looks like he already hit
band camp.

18:23.736 --> 18:24.836
BARKIN:
That's science camp.

18:24.838 --> 18:26.370

He's heading to clown camp.

Ronnie, you're a...
what is that?

18:44.991 --> 18:46.124
A chipmunk or something?

18:46.126 --> 18:47.925
Actually, I think I'm a beaver.

18:47.927 --> 18:49.794
I guess when you plunge
head first into a toxic pool

18:49.796 --> 18:51.696
you never exactly know
what you're going to get?

18:51.698 --> 18:53.965
Eat muck, chipmunk.

18:53.967 --> 18:55.867
( <i>loud burp</i> )

19:10.016 --> 19:11.282
( <i>gasps</i> )

19:12.885 --> 19:14.952
It's Gill and Ron.

19:14.954 --> 19:17.722
And he's... a chipmunk?

STOPPABLE:
Beaver. I'm a beaver.

19:19.359 --> 19:22.326

what he was doing... I think.

Mr. Barkin, we're going
to need a lift.

19:51.257 --> 19:53.724
Prepare to launch.

Fire one.

Fire two. Now, hold up.
I... ( <i>screams</i> )

20:06.238 --> 20:07.338
Go.

20:11.443 --> 20:13.711
A back-flip hurkey spring.

20:13.713 --> 20:14.946
And a side-hurdler lift-up.

20:14.948 --> 20:16.447
That's a little more
this century.

20:17.950 --> 20:18.849
( <i>gasps</i> )

20:25.891 --> 20:27.425
( <i>screams</i> )

20:29.394 --> 20:31.128
What better way to
catch a huge fish

20:31.130 --> 20:32.430
than with a huge net.

20:32.432 --> 20:34.031
Way to go, Beaver Boy.

20:34.033 --> 20:34.899
Oh, yeah!

20:34.901 --> 20:36.734
( <i>groans</i> )

20:41.907 --> 20:44.075
Wow, it's good
to be human again.

20:44.077 --> 20:47.111
Although I really wanted
to build a dam, you know,

20:47.113 --> 20:48.312
just for the experience.

20:48.314 --> 20:50.514
Mr. Stoppable, I
owe you an apology.

20:50.516 --> 20:53.217
I... I really thought
Gill had changed.

20:53.219 --> 20:56.520
He did, in a more evil
take-over-the-world kind of way.

20:56.522 --> 20:58.456
I can only blame myself.

20:58.458 --> 21:01.592
I just didn't set enough
limits for him.

21:03.195 --> 21:04.428
This isn't over, Squeab.

21:04.430 --> 21:05.429
This is far from over.

21:05.431 --> 21:07.198
That's enough out of you,
young man.

21:07.200 --> 21:09.300
No TV for a week.

21:09.302 --> 21:10.868
( <i>groans</i> )

21:10.870 --> 21:12.169
Thanks for the help, K.P.

21:12.171 --> 21:14.438
I seriously couldn't
have done it without you.

21:14.440 --> 21:15.473
No, big.

21:15.475 --> 21:17.141
As much as
it pains me to say it,

21:17.143 --> 21:18.943
I couldn't have done it
without Bonnie.

21:18.945 --> 21:19.910
Shh. They're awarding

21:19.912 --> 21:21.112
the Spirit Stick.

21:21.114 --> 21:22.546
Okay, cheer-people,

21:22.548 --> 21:24.515
we've all had a wild week,

21:24.517 --> 21:27.184
but it takes more than
a rampaging muck monster

21:27.186 --> 21:29.920
to stop the Gottagrin spirit.

21:29.922 --> 21:32.290
So the Spirit Stick

21:32.292 --> 21:35.459
goes to Shark kid
from West Wakewater High.

21:36.895 --> 21:40.031
Go... Sharks.

21:40.033 --> 21:42.099
Huh. After all that,
we got nothing.

21:42.101 --> 21:44.235
I mean, we do we
take away from this?

21:44.237 --> 21:46.871
Who cares
what we take from it? I lost.

21:46.873 --> 21:48.306
Bonnie, there's
always something

21:48.308 --> 21:50.207
you can learn from
any experience.

21:50.209 --> 21:51.275
Even if you lose.

21:51.277 --> 21:52.877
Normally, I'd say we learn

21:52.879 --> 21:54.845
that suspicion and paranoia
is bad,

21:54.847 --> 21:56.280
except that's what saved us.

21:56.282 --> 21:57.214
True.

21:57.216 --> 21:59.050
Well, maybe we learned

21:59.052 --> 22:01.085
that... I don't know.

22:01.087 --> 22:02.987
I didn't learn anything.

22:02.989 --> 22:04.955
That's it.

22:04.957 --> 22:06.557
Looking at you two
it's so clear.

22:06.559 --> 22:08.159
GIRLS:
What is so clear?

22:08.161 --> 22:09.226
If you two had set aside

22:09.228 --> 22:10.494
your differences earlier,

22:10.496 --> 22:12.196
one of you could have won
that Spirit Stick.

22:12.198 --> 22:13.597
That's the lesson here.

22:13.599 --> 22:14.932
( <i>girls groans</i>)

22:14.934 --> 22:16.834
How about cheer camp stinks?

22:16.836 --> 22:17.868
Yeah. Agreed.

22:17.870 --> 22:18.836
Yeah, it works for me.

22:18.838 --> 22:20.971
Oh, yeah.
