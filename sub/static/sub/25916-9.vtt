WEBVTT

00:06.006 --> 00:08.925
[theme music playing]

00:10.010 --> 00:11.428
[man]<i> Hey!</i>

00:26.818 --> 00:28.611
[snoring]

00:35.827 --> 00:37.412
[snoring]

00:44.044 --> 00:45.545
You're pacing again.

00:45.628 --> 00:47.589
I got a lot on my mind.

00:51.342 --> 00:52.594
What is wrong with you?

00:52.677 --> 00:56.723
For days, you don't eat, you don't sleep,
you don't throw bricks at seagulls.

00:56.806 --> 00:58.558
Where is the monster I married?

00:58.641 --> 01:00.226
Oh... Where are they?

01:00.310 --> 01:04.856
Bean! If you're out there, say something!

01:04.939 --> 01:06.649
[man] Put on some pants!

01:06.733 --> 01:08.985
[sighs heavily]

01:09.069 --> 01:10.695
[clapping]

01:10.779 --> 01:11.905
[herald] Hear ye, hear ye!

01:11.988 --> 01:14.115
The princess and her crew of misfits

01:14.199 --> 01:17.577
have been spotted returning
from their quest by Lady Kravitz,

01:17.660 --> 01:21.414
who happened to be peering out her window
at just the right moment.

01:21.498 --> 01:22.791
Yes!

01:22.874 --> 01:25.001
[man] Nice moves, grandpa!

01:30.090 --> 01:35.512
[gasps] It is so weird to wake up
on the back of a flying griffin

01:35.595 --> 01:38.181
and remember everything
from the night before.

01:38.264 --> 01:41.142
You mortal nerds sleep good?
We're almost home.

01:41.226 --> 01:43.353
Woo-hoo! Back in Dreamland!

01:43.436 --> 01:45.897
This Eternity Pendant or vial
or whatever you call it

01:45.980 --> 01:49.067
is gonna be my get-out-of-jail-free card
for, like, ever.

01:49.150 --> 01:50.693
I can do whatever I want!

01:50.777 --> 01:52.487
I'm totally gonna get those bangs.

01:52.570 --> 01:56.282
And I'll finally get the respect
a man of my hat deserves!

01:56.366 --> 01:58.326
Ah, here we are.

01:59.619 --> 02:02.330
[herald] Now announcing
the triumphant return of our heroes

02:02.413 --> 02:05.834
from their quest
that we all privately thought would fail.

02:12.632 --> 02:15.718
Your Highness,
I have good news and bad news.

02:15.802 --> 02:18.972
The good news is we have retrieved
the Eternity Pendant.

02:19.055 --> 02:21.349
The bad news is that we lost many good men

02:21.432 --> 02:22.642
-and it was awful--
-Yeah, yeah.

02:22.725 --> 02:25.478
Great story, great story.
Where's my pendant?

02:29.566 --> 02:33.194
Ah, my dreams are this close
to coming true.

02:33.278 --> 02:35.238
Now, where's my special little man?

02:35.321 --> 02:36.656
I'm right here, Father!

02:36.739 --> 02:38.867
Not you! I'm lookin' for Elfo.

02:39.492 --> 02:40.368
[Elfo] Hmm?

02:40.952 --> 02:46.583
"To lift the curse of Death itself,
one drop of blood from a true-born elf. Into the vial it shall drip,
to free one soul from Death's icy grip."

03:01.681 --> 03:04.601
Whoa. Am I turning into a god?

03:04.684 --> 03:08.521
I can feel the power rising up
through my body, bursting out.

03:09.314 --> 03:10.440
[burps]

03:10.523 --> 03:12.775
Aw, I'm not a god.

03:12.859 --> 03:15.153
I'm not even a healthy man.

03:15.236 --> 03:17.197
Oh, but it must've worked!

03:17.280 --> 03:20.909
Now, to test it,
we need a volunteer to kill you.

03:20.992 --> 03:21.826
Dibs.

03:21.910 --> 03:23.578
Wait. Hang on, hang on.

03:23.661 --> 03:27.248
Let's try it on somebody
a little more, uh, not me.

03:27.332 --> 03:30.627
I think I know someone
who'd welcome the attention.

03:31.211 --> 03:33.880
It is I, Prince Guysbert!

03:33.963 --> 03:36.966
They tried to compost me,
but the thought that, once again,

03:37.050 --> 03:40.136
I might gaze upon your face kept me alive.

03:40.220 --> 03:42.222
That and the rotted food scraps.

03:44.557 --> 03:47.894
You heard the shish kebab.
Let's give it a shot!

03:49.896 --> 03:50.730
[Elfo] Doink.

04:03.910 --> 04:07.205
My headache is gone!

04:17.131 --> 04:19.550
We lost him, but cured his headache.

04:19.634 --> 04:24.639
Ah, I shoulda never let you glue
those stars on your dunce cap.

04:30.561 --> 04:31.646
[trumpeting]

04:37.402 --> 04:42.740
Sire, we rode halfway across the world,
lost three noble knights,

04:42.824 --> 04:46.452
failed to find the vial
and we lost the princess...

04:46.536 --> 04:49.580
There she is, holding the vial. [chuckles]

04:49.664 --> 04:51.582
In sum, it was a successful trip.

04:51.666 --> 04:53.501
Yeah, real successful.

04:53.584 --> 04:56.504
How can you keep messing up
a recipe with two ingredients?

04:56.587 --> 04:59.549
-Come here, you...
-Ow, ow, ow...

04:59.632 --> 05:00.842
Your Majesty.

05:15.398 --> 05:16.566
[sighs]

05:16.649 --> 05:21.112
Son of a witch. I followed every possible
interpretation of the directions.

05:21.195 --> 05:22.780
Then what keeps going wrong?

05:22.864 --> 05:24.407
Maybe the vial is a fake.

05:24.490 --> 05:28.286
It's gotta be real.
I mean, it was glowing and dinging, okay?

05:28.369 --> 05:31.289
No substance known to man
both glows and dings.

05:31.372 --> 05:35.293
It could be a convincing knock-off
made of cheaper magic materials

05:35.376 --> 05:38.171
like Middle Earth Zirconia or pleather.

05:38.254 --> 05:39.547
We need an expert.

05:39.630 --> 05:41.966
Hmm. I think I know a guy.

05:42.050 --> 05:44.844
Fetch Old Man Touchy from the dungeon!

05:46.304 --> 05:47.138
Who?

05:47.221 --> 05:48.973
[Zog] <i>Old Man Touchy.</i>

05:49.057 --> 05:52.143
<i>There's nothing he's touched</i>
<i>that he can't identify,</i>

05:52.226 --> 05:54.312
<i>and there's nothing he hasn't touched,</i>

05:54.395 --> 05:56.064
<i>which is why he's in the dungeon.</i>

05:57.398 --> 06:01.402
Careful where you grab me.
I grab back! [chuckles]

06:09.369 --> 06:11.204
Long time no feel, Your Highness.

06:11.746 --> 06:12.705
[kisses]

06:12.789 --> 06:15.375
It is an honor to fulfill
your need for touch.

06:15.458 --> 06:18.669
Good to see a twinkle in the holes
where your eyes used to be.

06:18.753 --> 06:20.421
And what a lovely tunic.

06:20.922 --> 06:23.841
Three hundred-count
Plimgrovian cotton, I believe.

06:23.925 --> 06:26.344
[chuckles and exclaims]

06:26.427 --> 06:27.595
Touchy like.

06:27.678 --> 06:29.389
[stammers] Enough chitchat.

06:29.472 --> 06:31.057
Now, here's the deal, Touchy.

06:31.140 --> 06:34.602
This spell is only supposed to need
two ingredients:

06:34.685 --> 06:36.813
this vial and this elf's blood.

06:36.896 --> 06:38.439
But it's not working.

06:38.523 --> 06:40.817
I need you to tell me if this vial is--

06:40.900 --> 06:42.860
[giggling] That's my tummy!

06:43.778 --> 06:45.321
Guards! Guards!

06:48.074 --> 06:51.369
No, you sicko! Examine the vial, huh?

06:51.452 --> 06:53.621
Oh. If you insist.

06:54.831 --> 06:55.915
The vial is real.

06:55.998 --> 06:59.001
It's this specimen over here
that requires further examination.

06:59.085 --> 07:00.086
What?

07:01.087 --> 07:02.922
Ah, fascinating.

07:03.464 --> 07:05.883
I've never felt anything like this before!

07:06.426 --> 07:09.637
This isn't an elf,
but it's not not-an-elf.

07:09.720 --> 07:13.349
-He is, however, soft and velvety.
-Thank you.

07:13.433 --> 07:14.267
Wait, what?

07:14.350 --> 07:15.977
What do you mean it's not an elf?

07:16.060 --> 07:19.564
Your elf's blood won't work
because this is not an elf.

07:19.647 --> 07:22.817
You're wrong.
I demand a second opinion!

07:22.900 --> 07:24.152
Touch me somewhere else!

07:24.235 --> 07:27.738
So, this little twit,
who I welcomed into my home,

07:27.822 --> 07:31.451
clothed and fed
and built the finest luxury cage for,

07:31.534 --> 07:33.661
lied to me about being an elf?

07:33.744 --> 07:34.996
I didn't lie!

07:35.079 --> 07:36.622
Dad, don't be ridiculous.

07:36.706 --> 07:38.749
His name is Elfo, for Pete's sake.

07:38.833 --> 07:41.252
Tacking an "O" on the end of "Elf"? Bah!

07:41.335 --> 07:43.296
It's suspiciously on the nose.

07:43.379 --> 07:45.465
This is crazy. I'm an elf.

07:45.548 --> 07:47.383
My whole family are elves!

07:47.467 --> 07:51.429
If you look up "elf" in the dictionary,
the picture is my cousin Examplo!

07:51.512 --> 07:55.349
Ah, you.
You ruined everything I worked for.

07:55.433 --> 07:59.854
Lying to me in any other way
than flattery is a mortal crime.

07:59.937 --> 08:01.522
-Grab him!
-[grunts]

08:02.982 --> 08:06.611
Elfo is hereby banished from Dreamland.

08:06.694 --> 08:08.404
Get him outta here!

08:09.238 --> 08:10.406
[gasps]

08:10.948 --> 08:11.866
No!

08:18.414 --> 08:19.957
Goodbye, little man.

08:20.041 --> 08:22.919
If you get into trouble,
show them this note.

08:24.295 --> 08:25.630
[Elfo] "Kill me." Aw!

08:25.713 --> 08:27.632
Pendergast gave to me.

08:27.715 --> 08:29.175
Now, I give to you.

08:29.967 --> 08:31.469
[Bean] Elfo! [grunting]

08:32.887 --> 08:35.056
Bean, I'll miss you!

08:35.139 --> 08:38.476
Elfo, this is not over!
Stay-- [muffled grunting]

08:39.060 --> 08:40.228
Stay what?

08:40.311 --> 08:42.605
Stay cool, never change.

08:43.356 --> 08:44.815
Have a great summer.

09:02.041 --> 09:03.292
[Zog grunting]

09:07.046 --> 09:08.005
[chicken squawks]

09:09.882 --> 09:11.425
How could you do this?

09:11.509 --> 09:14.929
Elfo risked his life
getting you that stupid vial!

09:15.012 --> 09:17.557
Not now, Bean.
Daddy's very angry.

09:18.015 --> 09:19.433
You know, I just realized something.

09:19.517 --> 09:21.477
You're the reason
I have a drinking problem.

09:21.561 --> 09:23.646
Of course I am. I'm your father.

09:23.729 --> 09:25.856
You know what else you are?
You're selfish.

09:25.940 --> 09:27.066
You're a terrible king.

09:27.149 --> 09:29.569
And even if you do find a way
to live for eternity,

09:29.652 --> 09:32.655
no one in their right mind
would want to spend it with you.

09:33.823 --> 09:34.991
Take her away.

09:35.074 --> 09:37.660
Lock her up till she stops
pointing things out.

09:37.743 --> 09:39.161
Her chamber, sire?

09:39.245 --> 09:41.956
Nah, she's too good
at escaping from there.

09:42.039 --> 09:43.708
Some place more secure.

09:43.791 --> 09:46.002
And her smart-mouthed cat, too.

09:46.085 --> 09:48.337
Nice typical reaction, Mr. Predictable.

09:51.632 --> 09:52.633
[sighs]

09:53.551 --> 09:54.594
There, there.

09:56.512 --> 09:57.638
[Bean] Hey!

09:57.722 --> 09:59.056
Let me out!

09:59.140 --> 10:00.683
If Elfo goes, I go!

10:00.766 --> 10:02.810
No cannot do, Princess.

10:02.893 --> 10:04.020
[Odval] But I can.

10:09.317 --> 10:11.444
Go. Find your friend. Wow. That's pretty decent.

10:13.738 --> 10:15.823
I was not expecting that.

10:15.906 --> 10:19.702
I wish you the best of luck
embarrassing some other kingdom.

10:19.785 --> 10:22.622
-But were you expecting that?
-Yeah, kinda.

10:25.916 --> 10:29.587
-You let Princess run away?
-For now.

10:36.218 --> 10:38.929
Elfo! Elfo!

10:39.013 --> 10:40.681
-[Luci] I found him!
-You did?

10:40.765 --> 10:44.018
Wait a minute. It's just three quarters
of a dead raccoon.

11:03.579 --> 11:05.081
-[rustling]
-[gasps]

11:05.665 --> 11:07.249
Who's there? Stay back!

11:07.333 --> 11:08.501
I'm warning you.

11:16.008 --> 11:16.842
[grunts]

11:17.551 --> 11:20.096
Tell! Me! Who! You! Are!

11:20.179 --> 11:21.889
Hi! I'm! Elfo!

11:21.972 --> 11:23.516
Luci? [gasps]

11:24.016 --> 11:25.726
-You guys came for me?
-[grunting]

11:25.810 --> 11:28.479
You're the best friends
I could ever imagine.

11:28.562 --> 11:30.690
You do realize you're still hitting me?

11:30.773 --> 11:33.526
Yes, but I'm scared of what you'll do
when I stop.

11:42.493 --> 11:44.120
Hey, hey, hey, slow down, champ.

11:44.203 --> 11:46.872
Oh, God, I'm turning into my bartender.

11:46.956 --> 11:48.541
It all makes sense now.

11:48.624 --> 11:51.377
Growing up, I never fit in
among the elves.

11:51.460 --> 11:52.878
Listen, I feel you.

11:52.962 --> 11:56.257
After my mom died, I felt like
I didn't fit in anywhere, really.

11:56.340 --> 11:58.092
I never even met my mom.

11:58.175 --> 12:00.428
Maybe that's why I've had
such low elf-esteem.

12:00.511 --> 12:03.180
Dude, you can't have elf-esteem.
You're not an elf.

12:03.264 --> 12:06.892
You're never gonna be whole
until you figure out who you really are.

12:06.976 --> 12:09.353
And there's only one way
to find the answer.

12:10.354 --> 12:14.066
No. No, I can't go crawling back home!

12:14.150 --> 12:16.652
It'll wreck my image as a total badass.

12:16.736 --> 12:19.321
What'd you do,
forget to return a library book?

12:19.405 --> 12:22.199
Yes!
[gasps] I can never go back!

12:22.283 --> 12:25.202
But you'll never know the truth
unless you return to Elfwood.

12:25.286 --> 12:27.747
The only problem is,
the location is a secret,

12:27.830 --> 12:30.124
and elves are never supposed
to bring outsiders.

12:30.207 --> 12:32.543
-You're not an elf.
-Oh, yeah!

12:32.626 --> 12:34.128
[giggles] Okay, let's go.

12:39.550 --> 12:43.012
[sniffs] Wait, I smell cocoa...

12:43.095 --> 12:44.847
[sniffs] caramel...

12:44.930 --> 12:46.849
[sniffs] and conformity!

12:46.932 --> 12:49.185
Elfwood! We're here!

12:50.770 --> 12:54.732
Okay, they're suspicious of outsiders,
so let's be smart about this.

12:54.815 --> 12:56.108
I'm Clarence,

12:56.192 --> 13:01.155
you're a scrappy, small-town reporter
doing a story on Elfwood, and you're--

13:01.238 --> 13:03.491
-[elf] We can hear you, Elfo.
-Oh.

13:03.574 --> 13:07.161
[chuckling] Oh. Um... Hi.

13:07.661 --> 13:10.581
Uh, can we come in? Please?

13:10.664 --> 13:13.250
[elf] He's with an outsider
and a deformed cat.

13:13.334 --> 13:15.085
I don't know if that's a good idea.

13:15.169 --> 13:16.003
[Elfo] Why not?

13:16.086 --> 13:18.172
[elf] They might not fit in.

13:18.255 --> 13:20.007
Wow, I didn't know elves were racist.

13:20.090 --> 13:21.675
[elf] We are not racist!

13:21.759 --> 13:23.928
How can the world's greatest race
be racist?

13:24.011 --> 13:25.638
And would a racist do this?

13:33.312 --> 13:35.314
[upbeat music plays]

13:40.110 --> 13:43.280
Whoa! I owe you an apology, Elfo.

13:43.364 --> 13:45.950
Relatively speaking, you're a badass.

13:46.534 --> 13:50.204
It's times like this
I wish I had 3,000 fists.

13:50.871 --> 13:52.289
Welcome to Elfwood!

13:52.373 --> 13:55.626
Home of open-minded elves
of all shapes and one size.

13:55.709 --> 13:56.836
Right, Watcho?

13:56.919 --> 14:00.339
Hmm. I'll be watching and judging
and generalizing.

14:01.966 --> 14:03.425
[creaking]

14:03.509 --> 14:04.718
[grunts]

14:04.802 --> 14:07.263
I am so sorry. It was an accident.

14:07.346 --> 14:09.014
[groans] My eye!

14:09.098 --> 14:11.725
-Oh, I am so sorry. Let me--
-Oh!

14:13.394 --> 14:16.188
Just go inside
before you help me to death.

14:18.440 --> 14:20.484
[cheerful music playing over gramophone]

14:24.488 --> 14:25.573
[all gasp]

14:27.575 --> 14:28.784
[gasps] [music stops]

14:36.876 --> 14:38.627
Wha?

14:38.711 --> 14:43.007
There, once again, Elfo,
you've made a mockery of the Jolly Code!

14:43.090 --> 14:44.967
Who is that puny, little runt?

14:45.050 --> 14:48.053
-Oh, that's Luci. He's a demon.
-[elves gasp]

14:48.137 --> 14:49.763
And who is that?

14:49.847 --> 14:53.100
-Oh, that's Bean. She's a human.
-[elves exclaiming]

14:53.183 --> 14:57.521
[sighs] Humans bring nothing
but treachery and pain.

14:57.605 --> 15:00.316
-No, I also brought booze.
-[elves exclaim]

15:04.403 --> 15:07.323
Elfo, I didn't know you were coming back.

15:07.406 --> 15:09.992
I didn't know I had
unfinished business here.

15:10.075 --> 15:13.662
-There's someone I'd like you to meet.
-Whoa!

15:14.496 --> 15:16.749
What? But how could he be...

15:17.249 --> 15:19.168
I've only been gone a few months!

15:19.251 --> 15:21.003
That's all it takes.

15:22.171 --> 15:24.381
All this time I didn't know I had a son! Oh, no, this is Shrimpo, my new boyfriend.

15:26.759 --> 15:28.761
I was just trying to tell you
that I moved on.

15:28.844 --> 15:30.137
No hard feelings, bud.

15:30.846 --> 15:32.431
Oh. Of course not,

15:32.514 --> 15:34.892
but if you ever wanna throw
a ball around sometime...

15:34.975 --> 15:35.893
He doesn't,

15:35.976 --> 15:39.271
[whispering] but he doesn't mind
if you still wanna mess around.

15:41.398 --> 15:42.650
[Pops] Elfo, my boy!

15:42.733 --> 15:46.695
Well, whip my heinie
with a long red viney, you're back!

15:47.279 --> 15:50.783
Oh, Pops, you're just the guy
I came to see.

15:50.866 --> 15:52.201
[chuckling]

15:52.284 --> 15:54.411
And who's that statuesque sugar stack?

15:54.495 --> 15:56.956
Oh, you're a chip off the old block,
I see.

15:57.039 --> 15:59.124
The taste for big dames
runs in our family!

15:59.208 --> 16:02.586
Yeah, Pops, listen, if you could just
kinda geezer down for a moment...

16:02.670 --> 16:04.588
Sorry, we need to have a talk.

16:04.672 --> 16:06.215
Let me just check on my friends.

16:06.298 --> 16:07.633
[elves cheering]

16:07.716 --> 16:08.884
Okay, they're fine.

16:10.678 --> 16:11.971
[coughing]

16:12.054 --> 16:13.931
What kinda candy cigarette is this?

16:14.431 --> 16:15.683
Twinkletown Giggle Bud.

16:16.934 --> 16:18.936
Pops, I need to know the truth.

16:19.019 --> 16:20.729
Am I not a real elf?

16:20.813 --> 16:25.192
Oh, my boy. I've been meaning to...
But the thing is, I...

16:25.275 --> 16:26.527
So, you see...

16:26.610 --> 16:28.570
Well, I'm glad we had this talk.

16:28.654 --> 16:30.114
How 'bout you talk now?

16:30.197 --> 16:32.741
But you haven't said anything yet.

16:32.825 --> 16:36.578
I'm down to my second-to-last
emergency flask, so let's have a toast.

16:36.662 --> 16:39.248
You've opened up your gates
and your hearts.

16:39.331 --> 16:41.291
Here's to peace between our peoples,

16:41.375 --> 16:45.796
and may all ill will between elves
and humans be behind us.

16:46.880 --> 16:48.757
-Look out! Behind us!
-[elves gasp]

16:53.053 --> 16:56.724
[laughs] Thank you, Princess Tiabeanie.

16:56.807 --> 16:57.808
You followed us?

16:57.891 --> 16:59.977
It wasn't hard with a trail
of heavy bootprints

17:00.060 --> 17:03.147
and the tell-tale odor
of Dreamland ditch weed.

17:03.230 --> 17:05.524
The king of Dreamland requires elf blood.

17:05.607 --> 17:09.319
If three of the juiciest of you would hop
into my sack, we'll be on our way.

17:09.403 --> 17:11.071
I look like an elf.

17:11.155 --> 17:13.574
Come on, Dad. What am I?

17:13.657 --> 17:16.368
Well, I was waiting to tell you
until after I was dead,

17:16.452 --> 17:17.786
so I wouldn't have to tell you.

17:17.870 --> 17:22.374
It's hard to say, so, I'll let this
needlepoint do the talking for me.

17:22.458 --> 17:24.084
Your mom made it.

17:24.168 --> 17:27.212
Truth is, you're only half-elf.
You're also half--

17:27.296 --> 17:29.256
[elves screaming]

17:34.845 --> 17:37.431
How dare you threaten these innocent folk?

17:37.514 --> 17:39.058
I mean, look at this guy.

17:39.141 --> 17:40.726
Show him what's under your hat, buddy.

17:41.310 --> 17:44.188
It's not just a kitten,
it's a sleeping kitten.

17:44.271 --> 17:46.565
These guys are totally defenseless.

17:46.648 --> 17:48.317
[Elfo] Not totally.

17:50.444 --> 17:51.695
[Pendergast grunts]

17:54.281 --> 17:56.283
Get those little bastards.

17:56.366 --> 17:59.161
And help me up, I'm beetle-ing.

18:00.079 --> 18:01.747
[elves screaming]

18:09.129 --> 18:10.923
Sound the battle bell!

18:11.507 --> 18:14.176
[delicate bell chiming]

[whimpering]

18:40.661 --> 18:42.412
-[grunts]
-[Edgar] Huh? Ow!

18:45.541 --> 18:46.500
[giggles]

18:46.583 --> 18:47.835
[Pendergast grunting]

18:55.509 --> 18:56.844
Ow.

18:56.927 --> 18:58.804
What happened to my bravest man?

18:58.887 --> 19:02.432
Edgar the Fearless is now
Edgar the Headless.

19:02.516 --> 19:04.309
[Pendergast] Retreat! Retreat!

19:06.270 --> 19:07.938
[elves exclaiming]

19:11.066 --> 19:15.571
You think you can defeat the entire
elf kingdom with six knights? Ha!

19:17.406 --> 19:20.325
Five, six, seven... Oh, nuts.

19:20.409 --> 19:23.787
We need to disappear!
Close the gates!

19:24.538 --> 19:27.624
It won't close. The big girl broke it!

19:27.708 --> 19:29.751
We can't vanish with the door open!

19:29.835 --> 19:31.795
It would defy the laws of physics.

19:31.879 --> 19:33.797
We can try and close it from the outside.

19:34.590 --> 19:38.302
By order of your father,
you will stand aside, Tiabeanie!

19:38.385 --> 19:40.262
Hey, nobody calls me Tiabeanie

19:40.345 --> 19:42.973
except my best friends
and my worst enemies.

19:43.056 --> 19:44.766
[grunting]

20:11.210 --> 20:12.461
[Elfo and Bean cheering]

20:12.544 --> 20:13.712
You did it!

20:13.795 --> 20:15.505
No, we did it.

20:15.589 --> 20:18.634
Ah, screw team spirit.
Those elves stole my stash.

20:18.717 --> 20:20.135
We are a team.

20:20.219 --> 20:21.386
I always thought so.

20:21.470 --> 20:23.263
Really? [groans]

20:23.347 --> 20:24.640
No! Elfo!

20:26.433 --> 20:28.143
Elfo, speak to me. Elfo!

20:28.227 --> 20:29.311
Who did that?

20:31.521 --> 20:34.024
Now, just keep holding on, okay?
Just keep holding on.

20:35.567 --> 20:37.569
[grunts] It's okay.

20:38.237 --> 20:39.404
It's okay, Bean.

20:40.322 --> 20:43.033
I always wanted to go out
while I'm still young and hot.

20:44.326 --> 20:46.703
Your dad's got the immortality thing
all wrong.

20:47.287 --> 20:49.748
That monster is not my dad anymore.

20:49.831 --> 20:51.250
You're all I've got!

20:51.333 --> 20:53.293
Please, stay with me.

20:54.169 --> 20:56.088
Elfo, stay with me.

21:12.562 --> 21:18.068
Oh, man, if this is sadness,
I don't like it one bit.

21:18.652 --> 21:20.988
Princess, it's time to go.

21:26.743 --> 21:29.830
We must relay a message to the king
that the mission has failed.

21:29.913 --> 21:31.957
We didn't get a single elf.

21:32.040 --> 21:33.875
A real elf, that is.

21:34.960 --> 21:36.128
Send a turkey.

21:42.384 --> 21:43.593
[turkey gobbling]

22:10.245 --> 22:13.582
Aw, Beanie. If there's anything I can do--

22:13.665 --> 22:14.916
Don't touch me.

22:15.000 --> 22:17.002
Nothing you can do can fix this.

22:17.085 --> 22:19.671
Elfo is dead because of you.

22:20.422 --> 22:22.924
Maybe I did go a tad overboard.

22:23.008 --> 22:25.927
Your fanatical obsession
with the Elixir of Life,

22:26.011 --> 22:27.387
was it worth all of this?

22:27.471 --> 22:30.807
I don't even think it's real.
It's just some myth in a book.

22:33.560 --> 22:36.313
It's unfortunate you lost
your friend, Beanie.

22:36.396 --> 22:38.774
I didn't just lose my best friend.

22:38.857 --> 22:40.275
I lost my father.

22:40.359 --> 22:43.153
You lied to me and betrayed me. Get out!

22:44.863 --> 22:46.907
You're right. I did lie to you.

22:47.532 --> 22:50.786
The Elixir of Life, it wasn't for me.

22:50.869 --> 22:52.579
It was for your mother.

22:52.662 --> 22:54.748
I was trying to bring her back.

22:54.831 --> 22:57.959
My whole world was wrapped up
in this vial.

22:58.043 --> 23:00.504
Mom's been dead for 15 years!

23:00.587 --> 23:03.507
There's nothing left of her.
Stop trying to manipulate me.

23:03.590 --> 23:05.926
This is your mother.

23:09.805 --> 23:13.392
<i>That fateful night,</i>
<i>the taster, he was late.</i>

23:17.020 --> 23:18.939
<i>You were such a little monkey.</i>

23:19.022 --> 23:23.318
<i>You were switching our cups</i>
<i>back and forth, and I didn't know.</i>

23:23.402 --> 23:27.989
<i>The cursed poison that was meant for me,</i>
<i>she drank it instead.</i>

23:28.073 --> 23:29.783
[gasping]

23:35.288 --> 23:36.289
Bean?

23:42.045 --> 23:46.299
I didn't want to tell you
because I'm terrified of female emotions,

23:46.383 --> 23:48.760
and I didn't want you to feel guilty.

23:48.844 --> 23:51.346
So, I've been grasping at straws,

23:51.430 --> 23:54.641
trying to find a way
to bring your mother back ever since.

23:54.724 --> 23:57.310
But now, it's all a pipe dream.

23:58.478 --> 24:00.730
I'm sorry, Bean, for everything.

24:02.190 --> 24:04.317
I'll let you be alone.

24:04.401 --> 24:07.696
And whenever you're ready,
we'll get you a new pet.

24:12.576 --> 24:14.202
God damn.

24:14.286 --> 24:18.081
Well, hey, good thing is,
I swiped the only thing he cares about.

24:18.165 --> 24:20.709
That's gotta make you feel
a little better, right?

24:20.792 --> 24:21.668
Bean?

24:22.335 --> 24:26.214
So, I'm responsible
for my own mother's death, too?

24:26.298 --> 24:27.591
Am I a bad person?

24:28.175 --> 24:30.969
I'm so sorry, Mom.

24:31.636 --> 24:33.096
I wish you were here.

24:36.600 --> 24:37.934
[Luci stammers]

24:38.018 --> 24:41.771
Sorry, it's just... You have snot,
like, all over your face.

24:41.855 --> 24:43.690
Thanks, yeah.

24:43.773 --> 24:44.691
[gasps]

24:46.860 --> 24:48.195
This is elf's blood.

24:48.695 --> 24:50.155
Real elf's blood.

24:50.238 --> 24:52.365
You don't think
it'd actually work, do you?

24:52.949 --> 24:57.662
No, probably not.
But I guess it doesn't hurt to try.

25:16.264 --> 25:19.643
There's only one drop of blood.
I don't know who to choose.

25:19.726 --> 25:22.979
I don't want to get your hopes up.
It'll probably fizzle out like before.

25:23.063 --> 25:25.565
So, just close your eyes
and don't think too much.

25:36.409 --> 25:38.245
Whatever happens, happens.

26:04.271 --> 26:05.564
Mom?

26:08.066 --> 26:09.317
What?

26:09.401 --> 26:11.653
Bean? Bean?

26:11.736 --> 26:13.321
Is that you, Bean?

26:17.158 --> 26:19.327
[Dagmar sighing]
