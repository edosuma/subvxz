big scab off your knee?

-No.
-Don't touch the scab!

02:10.797 --> 02:13.925
My science fair project proves
that an asteroid

Good luck with your project,

you haven't started yet.

02:24.185 --> 02:27.856

Hmm...

02:38.491 --> 02:40.785
Hey, Bart!
Is your cootie shot ready?

02:40.869 --> 02:43.204
No. The science fair's
not till next week.

02:43.288 --> 02:44.956
I really need that shot.

02:45.039 --> 02:47.542
My dog and I accidentally
touched tongues.

02:47.625 --> 02:50.753
How is it "accidentally"
when this is the fifth time?

02:51.921 --> 02:54.215
-(door shuts)
-Bart, isn't that awfully similar

02:54.299 --> 02:56.885
to the cootie patch
you did last year?

02:56.968 --> 03:00.221
That was preventative.
This is morning-after.

03:00.305 --> 03:03.099
Oh, you're right.

03:04.601 --> 03:06.269
Oh, what am I going to do?

03:06.352 --> 03:08.271
Good ideas don't grow on trees.

03:08.354 --> 03:10.106
Hmm.

03:10.190 --> 03:12.108
Or do they?

03:12.192 --> 03:14.611
(humming wistfully)

03:17.363 --> 03:18.907
(grunts) Good shot!

03:18.990 --> 03:21.910
Not really. I was trying to
bounce it off your left testie.

03:21.993 --> 03:23.578
"Testis," my friend.

03:23.661 --> 03:26.748
(sighs) Look, I need help
with my science fair project.

03:28.291 --> 03:31.753
To sweeten the deal,
I'll pick you first for basketball.

03:31.836 --> 03:34.005

04:16.130 --> 04:19.133
-Roz Davis, your new assistant.
-Assistant?

04:19.217 --> 04:22.095
Well, I have been
pretty overworked lately.

04:22.178 --> 04:24.639
But I guess I should find out
a little bit about you.

04:24.722 --> 04:26.641
I'm just a gal from Ohio

04:26.724 --> 04:29.811
who never wants to call her daddy again
and say, "I need to borrow money."

04:29.894 --> 04:31.312
So your dad has money to lend?

04:32.647 --> 04:33.898
(bird caws)

04:33.982 --> 04:35.900
This is where we get our coffee.

04:35.984 --> 04:37.443
Just leave a little at the bottom,

04:37.527 --> 04:39.654
so someone else has to
make the next pot.

04:39.737 --> 04:41.698
The burning smell
will let them know.

04:41.781 --> 04:42.991
Genius.

04:43.074 --> 04:44.742
Uh-oh. It's old man Burns.

04:44.826 --> 04:47.245
Hello, young man Burns!

04:47.328 --> 04:50.665
Oh, Simpson, you do know
how to whip my buggy.

04:52.917 --> 04:55.878
(chuckles)
That sucker soaks up flattery

04:55.962 --> 04:58.673
like a Twinkie soaks up gravy.

04:58.756 --> 05:01.843
Well, when it's a handsome guy
like you talking...

05:01.926 --> 05:03.594
(laughing) Well...

05:03.678 --> 05:06.014
Your giggle's like strawberry wine.

05:06.097 --> 05:07.432
Oh!

05:07.515 --> 05:09.142
(giggles, snorts)

05:09.225 --> 05:11.436
And your snort's like
a summer breeze.

(laughing)

05:12.854 --> 05:14.856
(choking, coughing)

05:18.318 --> 05:20.528
That's not very attractive, though.

05:20.611 --> 05:22.363
-You okay?
-(grunts) I'm fine.

05:27.410 --> 05:30.371
Bart, I fail to see
the scientific function

05:30.455 --> 05:32.999
of this "Homer Humiliator"
you've devised.

05:33.666 --> 05:36.336
Well, we gotta
come up with something.

05:37.420 --> 05:39.881
Hey, what if we make
some kind of robopet?

05:39.964 --> 05:42.425
What made you think of that?

05:44.844 --> 05:46.679
-(panting)

05:46.763 --> 05:48.931

05:49.015 --> 05:50.975

05:51.059 --> 05:53.978
A robopet! Not a bad idea.

05:54.062 --> 05:56.522
-Bully, Bart! Bully!
-Where? Is it Nelson?

05:56.606 --> 05:59.108
No, Bart, it's just an expression.

05:59.192 --> 06:01.444

06:16.501 --> 06:19.253
-Aw...
-Precisely.

06:19.337 --> 06:23.091

06:24.467 --> 06:26.761

BART: Check it out!

07:13.975 --> 07:15.101
ALL: Aw...

07:15.184 --> 07:17.395
So the soft fur, big eyes,
and gentle motion

07:17.478 --> 07:19.605
are designed to make
it one hell of a pet,

07:19.689 --> 07:21.357
with none of the poop.

07:21.441 --> 07:23.443
This is the most adorable thing

07:23.526 --> 07:25.862
I've ever seen in my entire life.

07:31.033 --> 07:33.578
(clears throat)
What a wonderful science fair.

07:33.661 --> 07:35.621
Unfortunately,
due to budget cuts,

07:35.705 --> 07:37.623
we could not afford
our third place ribbon.

07:37.707 --> 07:40.668
Now, in second place,
Lisa Simpson's grim description

07:40.751 --> 07:43.463
of our shortsighted dependence
on fossil fuels.

07:43.546 --> 07:45.506
It's about an asteroid.

07:45.590 --> 07:47.550
They're all the same, Gloomhilda.

07:47.633 --> 07:50.636
First place goes to Bart Simpson
and Martin Prince...

07:50.720 --> 07:52.805
-Yeah!
-(kisses)

07:52.889 --> 07:54.974
...for creating a furry robotic friend

07:55.057 --> 07:57.393
who provides comfort
when humans fail to.

07:57.477 --> 07:58.728
Which they will, trust me.

07:58.811 --> 08:02.273
I carried you in my belly
for four and a half months.

08:02.356 --> 08:05.693
When you fell out on the bus,
that's when my job ended.

08:07.195 --> 08:09.655
(Ping-Pong ball bouncing)

08:09.739 --> 08:12.742
Congratulations on
getting a ribbon, Lisa!

08:12.825 --> 08:15.745
You must've baked
a mighty fine pie.

08:15.828 --> 08:17.538
It wasn't a pie.

08:17.622 --> 08:19.957
It was science!
And it's not fair.

08:20.041 --> 08:22.210
My project was way better than Bart's,

08:22.293 --> 08:24.045
and I didn't have help from a nerd!

08:24.128 --> 08:26.881
-I'm my own nerd!
-Oh, sweetie.

08:26.964 --> 08:29.342
Being second ain't the worst thing
that can happen.

08:29.425 --> 08:31.928
Look at poor old Jasper over there.

08:32.011 --> 08:34.680
(raspy sigh)

08:34.764 --> 08:38.643
(sighs) He lost his wife,
his kids don't call.

08:38.726 --> 08:41.521
Soon he'll just be bones and beard.

09:06.629 --> 09:08.047
Wow.

09:08.130 --> 09:10.591
While I was sitting here
feeling sorry for myself,

09:10.675 --> 09:14.303
Bart's invention actually
changed someone's life.

09:14.387 --> 09:18.307
And best of all, I got funding
for my Homer Humiliator.

09:18.391 --> 09:19.767
Hmm!

09:19.850 --> 09:21.727
Ooh! D'oh!

09:21.811 --> 09:24.939
Why would a Homer Humiliator
do this to me?

09:39.370 --> 09:41.789
(ringing)

09:41.872 --> 09:43.708
Yello. Hey, Barney.

09:43.791 --> 09:46.919
A free movie screening?
Of course I can go!

09:47.003 --> 09:49.547
I just need somebody
to hold down the fort.

09:49.630 --> 09:50.798
Hmm...

09:50.881 --> 09:52.550
Hm! Oh, uh, Roz?

09:52.633 --> 09:55.261
I have to step out
for one hour and 43 minutes.

09:55.344 --> 09:57.138
-Could you cover for me?
-Go ahead.

09:57.221 --> 10:00.600
(whoops) Oh, uh,
if an emergency alarm goes off,

10:00.683 --> 10:03.227
there's earplugs
in the top drawer.

10:17.950 --> 10:19.160
Mm-mm.

10:19.243 --> 10:20.828
(groans)

10:20.911 --> 10:22.538
(laughing loudly)

10:22.622 --> 10:24.582
Life imitates Flart.

10:24.665 --> 10:27.835
-It says that on the poster.
-I thought of it first.

10:29.337 --> 10:31.547
Marge, I just saw
the greatest movie!

10:31.631 --> 10:35.176
Guess what happens when a mop
is replaced with an octopus.

10:35.259 --> 10:36.677
I'll give you a clue.

10:36.761 --> 10:38.054
It's funny!

10:38.137 --> 10:40.598
Take off the 3-D glasses.

10:42.183 --> 10:44.518
-(screams)
-Simpson-- a gangly little bird

10:44.602 --> 10:47.271
told me you've been
lollygagging at the Biograph.

10:47.355 --> 10:49.690
(stammering)
Someone snitched?

10:49.774 --> 10:51.525
W-W-What are you
going to do to me?

10:51.609 --> 10:54.153
-You're demoted.
-Up, or down?

10:54.236 --> 10:56.113
-Down!
-(shrieks)

10:56.989 --> 10:59.241
Don't tell my wife.

10:59.325 --> 11:01.327
(children laughing)

11:02.662 --> 11:05.081
So, partner,
what's next on the agenda?

11:05.164 --> 11:06.832
Oh, um...

11:06.916 --> 11:08.292
Back off, man!

11:08.376 --> 11:10.628
Can't you see
you're embarrassing Bart?

11:10.711 --> 11:12.505
When did you take that picture?

11:12.588 --> 11:13.673
(chuckles)

11:13.756 --> 11:15.966
Last time you slept over at my house.

11:16.050 --> 11:18.761
I love when you're sleeping
and at peace.

11:18.844 --> 11:20.805
(groans)

11:20.888 --> 11:23.599
Hey, Skippy, we need some more
of them lovable critters

11:23.683 --> 11:25.101
for our friends at the home.

11:25.184 --> 11:27.103
(chuckles)
Unless you got any heroin.

11:27.186 --> 11:28.604
You got any heroin?

11:29.689 --> 11:30.690
Hmm?

11:32.024 --> 11:33.859
Well, then, critters it is.

11:36.362 --> 11:37.947
I'm telling you guys,

11:38.030 --> 11:40.366
Roz told old man Burns
I ditched work early,

11:40.449 --> 11:42.118
and now I'm her assistant.

11:42.201 --> 11:43.494
I don't know, Homer.

11:43.577 --> 11:46.747
You're saying she's nice on the outside,
but mean on the inside?

11:46.831 --> 11:49.041
-No one could pull that off.
-Enjoy.

11:49.125 --> 11:50.710
And as for you, Homer, don't worry.

11:50.793 --> 11:54.380
You're at Moe's tavern--
lady-free since '83.

11:54.463 --> 11:57.133
What the...
This is a gentleman's club!

11:57.216 --> 11:59.218
Yeah! (belches)

11:59.301 --> 12:02.638
So, what you boys drinkin'?
I'm buyin'.

12:02.722 --> 12:04.473
Can we just have
the cash value of the drink?

12:04.557 --> 12:06.809
-Be my guest.
-I'd rather use my money

12:06.892 --> 12:08.894
to buy a Moe souvenir T-shirt.

12:10.187 --> 12:11.564
That comes in kid sizes, too.

12:11.647 --> 12:13.941
HOMER:
Oh, no, this is terrible.

12:14.024 --> 12:15.943
What am I gonna do? Oh...

12:16.026 --> 12:18.529
-Aren't you gonna come to bed, Homie?
-Can't, Marge.

12:18.612 --> 12:20.656
I'm fighting for
my professional life here.

12:20.740 --> 12:22.533
Do you know what I just learned?

12:22.616 --> 12:25.870
My job is the reason
I get those checks every week.

12:25.953 --> 12:30.040
And now that I'm demoted,
the checks have gotten smaller.

12:30.124 --> 12:32.376
Not in physical size, but...

12:32.460 --> 12:33.794
I know. I know.

12:33.878 --> 12:36.964
♪♪

12:55.441 --> 12:58.194
I represent the Eternal Valley
funeral home,

12:58.277 --> 13:01.489
and I'm here to talk about
an extremely unpleasant subject--

13:01.572 --> 13:03.282
people continuing to live.

13:03.365 --> 13:05.659
If we don't have a frickin'
funeral soon, people,

13:05.743 --> 13:07.828
you can say good-bye
to Howard's Flowers!

13:07.912 --> 13:09.705
Calm down, Howard, Jr.

13:09.789 --> 13:12.041
Now, here is the zip,
the zap, and the zing.

13:12.124 --> 13:14.293
We're gonna rewire
Charlie Loveable here

13:14.376 --> 13:16.879
into the greatest threat
to seniors' lives

13:16.962 --> 13:19.256
since nursing homes themselves.

13:21.592 --> 13:23.302
Switcheroo.

13:23.385 --> 13:25.471
(growling)

13:31.560 --> 13:32.937
Impressive.

13:33.020 --> 13:36.190
Hard to believe two
ten-year-old kids built this.

13:36.273 --> 13:37.858
And I heard one of them
did all the work.

13:37.942 --> 13:38.943
-Wow.
-It's true.

13:45.699 --> 13:47.952
(panting) Am I early?

13:48.035 --> 13:49.495
You're late.

13:49.578 --> 13:51.914
Since I got demoted,
I have to show my I.D.,

13:51.997 --> 13:53.541
but the picture
was taken so long ago,

13:53.624 --> 13:54.750
I put on a lot of weight,

13:54.834 --> 13:56.877
so I have to stretch out
my face and say,

13:56.961 --> 13:58.921
"I used to look like this."

13:59.004 --> 14:00.172
Late.

14:01.799 --> 14:03.509
You're mean.

14:03.592 --> 14:06.470
Now, I want a list of 100 ways
to make your job worse

14:06.554 --> 14:08.055
by close of business today.

14:08.138 --> 14:10.558
-Can one of the 100 be making the list?
-No.

14:10.641 --> 14:12.685
Can some of them be callbacks
to earlier ones?

14:12.768 --> 14:14.854
-Also, no.
-(groans)

14:16.355 --> 14:18.816
We're live at
the Springfield Retirement Castle,

14:18.899 --> 14:21.694
where longtime resident,
Alice Glick, died last night,

14:21.777 --> 14:24.238
at the paws of this
cuddly little killer.

14:24.321 --> 14:26.282
Our Channel Six
substitute medical expert

14:26.365 --> 14:28.784
Dr. Nick Riviera had this to say.

14:28.868 --> 14:31.078
The champion was cleared to fight.

14:31.161 --> 14:34.707
Ahem, Doctor, this press conference
is about a nursing home death.

14:34.790 --> 14:36.333
The Springfield police are in the process

14:36.417 --> 14:37.459
-of taking all the robots...
-(screaming)

14:37.543 --> 14:39.837
<i>...into custody,</i>
<i>safely returning the seniors</i>

14:39.920 --> 14:42.047
<i>-to their hopeless, dismal lives.</i>
<i>-(gunfire)</i>

14:42.131 --> 14:44.216
Shut that thing off.

14:44.300 --> 14:46.635
-(machine stops)
-I meant the TV!

14:46.719 --> 14:48.679
-Sorry.
-(machine whirs)

14:49.597 --> 14:51.181
(doorbell rings)

14:51.974 --> 14:55.019
Hi. We need someone to reprogram
our robots to break out of jail.

14:55.102 --> 14:57.771
(stutters excitedly)
A chance to reprogram robots?

14:57.855 --> 15:00.524
Well, I had a date
with a beauty queen tonight,

15:00.608 --> 15:02.109
but forget it.

15:02.192 --> 15:04.778
(touch-tones beeping)

15:04.862 --> 15:06.989
Uh, hello, yes, hello,
Miss Wyoming?

15:07.072 --> 15:10.326
I'll have to climb
your Grand Tetons another night.

15:10.409 --> 15:12.202
(laughs)
The breast joke!

15:12.286 --> 15:14.121
I-I served it up.

15:14.204 --> 15:16.540
Why won't he love me?!

15:16.624 --> 15:19.043
(sobbing)

15:23.631 --> 15:28.052
"Do this, do that."
Lousy Roz thinks she's so big.

15:28.135 --> 15:30.179
Well, looks like it's time for another

15:30.262 --> 15:32.139
"End of the Walk Talk
With Homer and Ned."

15:32.222 --> 15:34.475
Tonight's topic--
the niceness of the evening.

15:34.558 --> 15:37.144
-Hey.
-Homer, all nonsense aside,

15:37.227 --> 15:38.729
are you oka-lidoka-laroony?

15:38.812 --> 15:42.399
(sighs) I'm having problems
with my new boss Roz.

15:42.483 --> 15:45.778
She's the most evil person
to come out of Ohio since LeBron.

15:45.861 --> 15:47.571
But at least he thought
long and hard

15:47.655 --> 15:50.658
before screwing everybody over,
in public, for no reason.

15:50.741 --> 15:54.370
You know, I knew a backstabbing
Buckeye named Roz at Bible camp.

15:54.453 --> 15:57.498
-Twice as tall as she should've been.
-(gasps) Is this her?

15:57.581 --> 15:58.832
<i>Come on!</i>

15:58.916 --> 16:01.335
<i>The apple must be</i>
<i>wreaking havoc with the Twinkie!</i>

16:01.418 --> 16:02.962
(gasps) It is.

16:03.045 --> 16:04.546
But if you've got the stones,

16:04.630 --> 16:06.715
I can tell you
how to slay that "Gal-ioth."

16:06.799 --> 16:10.344
Are you aware that "stones"
means man junk?

16:10.427 --> 16:12.763
What the--
I've been using that around the boys.

16:12.846 --> 16:14.932
(groans weakly)

16:16.350 --> 16:17.768
Whew! Thank you.

16:17.851 --> 16:20.688
Now, it was one of
our biggest celebrations,

16:20.771 --> 16:23.399
<i>the 19th Sunday after Easter.</i>

16:23.482 --> 16:25.985
<i>We'd just had a rousing no-fun run,</i>
<i>and in the heat of the moment,</i>

16:26.068 --> 16:28.404
<i>I wanted to offer</i>
<i>my respectful best wishes.</i>

16:28.487 --> 16:29.863
Peace be with you.

16:29.947 --> 16:32.741
<i>Well, sir, she went crazy.</i>

16:32.825 --> 16:34.827
<i>Crazier than</i>
<i>sleeping in on a Sunday.</i>

16:34.910 --> 16:36.704
I can't stand to be touched!

16:36.787 --> 16:38.914
Never tell anyone!

16:38.998 --> 16:41.250
And I haven't. Not until now.

16:41.333 --> 16:43.460
That's it! That's it!

16:43.544 --> 16:45.212
My nightmare is over!

16:45.295 --> 16:48.424
Oh, Flanders,
you are my personal savior.

16:48.507 --> 16:50.342
Oh, that's nice,
but I don't approve of...

16:50.426 --> 16:53.429
Hail Flanders!
Mightier than Jesus!

16:53.512 --> 16:55.264
(groans)

16:56.765 --> 16:59.309
Yes, I, uh,
I hereby call to order

16:59.393 --> 17:03.355
this meeting of the North American
Man-Bot Love Association.

17:03.439 --> 17:06.859
I'll say this one more time--
we really should change that name.

17:06.942 --> 17:08.736
Yes, all right,
I'll change it to whatever you like,

17:08.819 --> 17:11.697
as long as "Man-Bot Love"
is in there somewhere.

17:11.780 --> 17:14.450
Now, let's look at
these blueprints, shall we?

17:14.533 --> 17:16.785
(excited murmuring)

17:18.537 --> 17:20.372
MARTIN: Wish I'd thought of that.

17:20.456 --> 17:23.125
Uh, first, we remotely adjust them

17:23.208 --> 17:25.210
so they will never be
malicious again.

17:25.294 --> 17:26.503
There, there, and there.

17:26.587 --> 17:28.756
Now, arise, little ones!

17:30.299 --> 17:32.551
(snores, mutters)

17:32.634 --> 17:34.553
Hey-Hey, what's going on here?

17:34.636 --> 17:36.472
I better call 9-1-1.

17:37.306 --> 17:38.432
(busy signal beeping)

17:38.515 --> 17:41.185
Oh, it's always busy when I call.

17:41.268 --> 17:43.395
(sighs)
What a bunch of idiots.

17:46.440 --> 17:50.194
Hey-- Aw, I can't stay mad at you.

17:51.320 --> 17:53.238
Go on, get out of here.

17:53.322 --> 17:55.532
-Oh, oh, Chief?
-Yeah?

17:57.117 --> 17:59.036
Yeah, you, too.

17:59.870 --> 18:01.038
(chuckles)

18:01.121 --> 18:03.290
Although this millennium
is still young,

18:03.373 --> 18:06.126
I feel it is time to award
this giant trophy,

18:06.210 --> 18:07.795
paid for with your health care cuts...

18:07.878 --> 18:10.589
-(crowd groans)
-...to our beloved Roz.

18:11.256 --> 18:13.217
(one person clapping slowly)

18:13.300 --> 18:15.803
What the deuce?
Sarcastic clapping?

18:15.886 --> 18:19.640
Congratulations, Roz.

18:19.723 --> 18:21.600
What are you doing here, Simpson?

18:21.683 --> 18:23.894
If there isn't dry cleaning
in the back of my car,

18:23.977 --> 18:26.355
there's gonna be blood
on my knuckles.

18:26.438 --> 18:29.441
Uh, I just came to say
that you're perfect.

18:29.525 --> 18:33.445
So perfect, I think Mr. Burns
should give you a hug.

18:33.529 --> 18:36.115
(gasps) Who told you?

18:36.198 --> 18:38.742
I won't say,
but his initials are S.F.

18:38.826 --> 18:40.452
Stupid Flanders!

18:40.536 --> 18:42.287
(chanting)
Hug, hug, hug!

18:42.371 --> 18:44.164
EMPLOYEES: Hug, hug, hug,

18:44.248 --> 18:47.167
hug, hug, hug, hug.

18:48.293 --> 18:49.878
(roaring)

18:49.962 --> 18:51.463
(bones cracking)

18:52.756 --> 18:54.466
You're fired.

18:55.676 --> 18:57.636
I underestimated you.

18:57.719 --> 18:59.179
I don't know what that
middle word means.

18:59.263 --> 19:02.224
Well, it means my perception of you
is that you were kind of a goof,

19:02.307 --> 19:04.184
but now I see you're rather clever.

19:04.268 --> 19:06.603
-What is perception?
-It's how I view you.

19:06.687 --> 19:07.938
-You understand that?
-No.

19:08.021 --> 19:09.231
I used to think you were an idiot.

19:09.314 --> 19:11.066
Now it turns out,
you're not such an idiot,

19:11.150 --> 19:13.861
in fact, you might even be smart.

19:13.944 --> 19:15.279
Little help?

19:16.864 --> 19:18.782
(both grunting)

19:26.957 --> 19:28.292
(muffled grunting)

19:28.375 --> 19:30.502
Rub the butter around you.

19:30.586 --> 19:32.129
(gulps)
Need more butter!

19:32.212 --> 19:34.256
And not the unsalted.

19:34.339 --> 19:36.049
Do you want to
get out of there or not?

19:40.387 --> 19:43.557
<i>Mr. J., if I don't get my green card,</i>

19:43.640 --> 19:46.727
<i>they're gonna turn me</i>
<i>back into a washing machine.</i>

19:46.810 --> 19:48.896
No dawdling. Just move it along.

19:54.693 --> 19:55.986
(sighs)

19:57.779 --> 20:00.616
Oy, oy! My mechanical mensch!

20:00.699 --> 20:03.035
How I missed you.
(grunts)

20:04.119 --> 20:05.621
Bless you, boys.

20:05.704 --> 20:09.541
Now that we got 'em back,
we'll never let 'em go again.

20:09.625 --> 20:11.501
'Cause there's no stronger force

20:11.585 --> 20:15.130

holding onto a freebie.
