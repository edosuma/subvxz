01:24.294 --> 01:26.129
WILLIE AND I
ARE GOING TO BE
VERY RICH

01:26.296 --> 01:28.047
BECAUSE WE GET
10 CENTS FOR
EVERY "A"

01:28.214 --> 01:29.841
AND A NICKEL
FOR EVERY "B."

01:30.008 --> 01:31.426
AND I GOT ALL Bs.

01:31.593 --> 01:34.429
THAT'S 25 CENTS,
BUT I'M GOING
TO GET EVEN MORE

01:34.596 --> 01:37.098
BECAUSE I GOT
THE BEST GRADES
IN THE WHOLE SCHOOL.

01:37.265 --> 01:41.060
MY PA SAYS THAT GRADES
AREN'T EVERYTHING, NELLIE.

01:41.227 --> 01:43.229
IT'S THE LEARNING
THAT COUNTS.

01:45.273 --> 01:47.358
EVEN EGGS GET GRADED.

01:58.203 --> 02:00.163
MARY, CAN I HELP YOU
WITH SOMETHING?

02:00.330 --> 02:04.250
NO, MA'AM. I JUST HAVE
TO FINISH COPYING MY NOTES
FOR TOMORROW'S TEST.

02:04.417 --> 02:07.712
AH, YES. IT'S TOO BAD
WE ONLY HAVE ONE
HISTORY TEXT.

02:07.879 --> 02:09.672
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE
TO COPY SO MUCH
MATERIAL.

02:09.839 --> 02:11.257
YES, MA'AM.

02:13.760 --> 02:17.138
MARY, I'M SORRY
I COULDN'T GIVE YOU
BETTER GRADES THIS TIME,

02:17.305 --> 02:21.434

WASN'T UP TO ITS
USUAL HIGH STANDARD.

02:21.601 --> 02:22.727
YES, MA'AM.

02:23.812 --> 02:25.355
I'LL TRY HARDER.

02:25.522 --> 02:28.441
THERE'S STILL 6 WEEKS
LEFT TO THE SEMESTER

02:28.608 --> 02:30.151

02:30.318 --> 02:31.569
IF YOU DO WELL IN THAT,
I'LL TAKE THAT

02:31.736 --> 02:33.780
INTO CONSIDERATION
IN YOUR FINAL GRADE.

DO SOMETHING RIGHT
THE FIRST TIME,

02:47.961 --> 02:49.420
YOU HAVE TO TRY AGAIN.

02:49.587 --> 02:52.632
MAYBE I JUST HAVEN'T
TRIED HARD ENOUGH.

03:13.152 --> 03:14.153
WHAT'D
SHE GIVE YOU?

03:14.320 --> 03:16.489
I GOT TWO Bs
AND 3 As.

03:16.656 --> 03:19.325
YOU'D GET ANOTHER "A," NELLIE,
IF THEY GAVE A GRADE
FOR BEING NASTY.

03:19.492 --> 03:22.662
COME ON, MARY.
WE DON'T HAVE TO TALK TO HER.

03:28.877 --> 03:32.755
MARY, DON'T WORRY ABOUT
A DUMB, OLD REPORT CARD.

03:32.922 --> 03:37.343
I BET PA'D STILL LOVE US
IF NEITHER ONE OF US
EVER GOT AN "A."

03:37.510 --> 03:41.180
NELLIE IS RIGHT.
I DID AWFUL.

04:07.540 --> 04:08.499
CAROLINE,
THAT MAY HAVE BEEN

04:08.666 --> 04:10.084

MAKE THESE FORKS
EASIER TO CLEAN.

WELL, YOU ALL HAVE
A RESPONSIBILITY.

04:19.344 --> 04:20.887

I THINK I HAVE ONE LEFT.

04:21.054 --> 04:22.722

REPORT CARD DAY?

04:22.889 --> 04:24.265
YES, IT WAS.

04:24.432 --> 04:26.392

A REPORT CARD.

HARDER WORDS
THAN ME.

YOU CAN ALWAYS BE PROUD
WHEN YOU MOVE A GRADE UP
LIKE THAT.

05:00.051 --> 05:01.427
YOU CAN BE PROUD
IF YOU TRY HARD,

05:01.594 --> 05:03.888
EVEN IF YOUR GRADES
DON'T SHOW IT,
CAN'T YOU, PA?

TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT

HARDER NOW THAN
IT WAS BEFORE.

TO HAVE TO STUDY
A LITTLE BIT MORE

BACK UP TO WHERE
THEY WERE.

TO YOU BEFORE YOU
SAW MARY'S REPORT.

I WAS GOING TO STOMP
AND RAISE CAIN

06:12.832 --> 06:13.666

06:13.833 --> 06:16.794

CONCERNED.

THAT MERIT DESERVES
A REWARD.

THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN A POLICY
IN OUR HOUSEHOLD

IN PAYING CHILDREN
FOR GRADES.

THEIR GRADES ARE.

10:40.808 --> 10:44.395
THE GIRLS DO A LOT
OF WORK AROUND THE FARM.

10:44.562 --> 10:46.230

OF LEARNING, TOO.

10:46.397 --> 10:48.482

10:48.649 --> 10:51.110
OF COURSE, I BELIEVE

10:51.277 --> 10:53.779
THAT IT'S MORE IMPORTANT
THAT THE TRUE SCHOLAR

TO SPEAK WITH YOU ABOUT.

11:31.317 --> 11:32.651
WELL, SHE'S NOT
SERIOUSLY ILL,
IS SHE?

11:32.818 --> 11:35.654
OH, NO, NO,
NOTHING LIKE THAT.

11:35.821 --> 11:37.406
IT'S ABOUT HER WORK.

11:37.573 --> 11:38.699
MRS. INGALLS,
TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH,

11:38.866 --> 11:40.618
I WISH I HAD A CLASSROOM
FULL OF STUDENTS

11:40.785 --> 11:44.205
THAT TRIED AS HARD
AS MARY DOES.

11:44.372 --> 11:45.373
THEN WHAT'S THE MATTER?

11:45.539 --> 11:48.667
SHE'S ALWAYS DONE SO WELL,
AND NOW...

11:48.834 --> 11:51.462
TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH,
I DON'T KNOW.

11:51.629 --> 11:54.590
SHE SEEMS TO APPLY
HERSELF, BUT...

11:54.757 --> 11:56.717
WELL, SHE JUST DOESN'T
SEEM TO BE ABLE TO COVER

11:56.884 --> 11:59.261
HALF THE MATERIAL
SHE USED TO.

11:59.428 --> 12:02.848
I WAS WONDERING IF SHE HAD
SOMETHING ELSE ON HER MIND.

12:03.015 --> 12:05.393
YOU MEAN
LIKE A BOYFRIEND.

12:05.559 --> 12:07.728
I WISH IT WERE THAT.
I THINK I COULD
HANDLE IT.

12:07.895 --> 12:09.939
I'M SURE YOU COULD.

12:10.106 --> 12:11.190
[SIGHS]

12:13.317 --> 12:14.735
YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES...

12:14.902 --> 12:17.530
A STUDENT CAN BE DOING
VERY WELL,

12:17.696 --> 12:20.032
AND THEN WE REACH
THE MORE COMPLICATED
MATERIAL,

12:20.199 --> 12:22.701
AND...THEY SEEM
TO FLOUNDER.

12:22.868 --> 12:26.705
YOU MEAN YOU THINK
MARY ISN'T SMART ENOUGH
TO DO THE ADVANCED WORK.

12:26.872 --> 12:28.666
NO, I DIDN'T SAY THAT.

12:28.833 --> 12:30.918
I JUST MEANT THAT
THERE COMES A POINT

12:31.085 --> 12:35.256
WHEN SOME STUDENTS
HAVE TO GO AT A SLOWER
PACE THAN OTHERS.

12:35.423 --> 12:38.551
I'VE SEEN STUDENTS
PUT BACK A GRADE
AND DO VERY WELL.

12:38.717 --> 12:40.094
THAT WOULD BREAK
MARY'S HEART.

12:40.261 --> 12:42.763
BELIEVE ME, I KNOW THAT.

12:42.930 --> 12:45.641
THAT'S WHY I HAVEN'T
SAID ANYTHING TO HER,

12:45.808 --> 12:48.185
BUT I THINK SHE'S BEGUN
TO REALIZE IT HERSELF.

12:48.352 --> 12:51.021
SHE HASN'T SAID
A THING AT HOME.

12:51.188 --> 12:55.401
DID SHE TELL YOU WE HAD
A HISTORY EXAM TODAY?

12:57.903 --> 13:00.614
SO THAT'S WHY SHE
DIDN'T WANT TO COME
TO SCHOOL TODAY.

13:00.781 --> 13:04.410
ON HER LAST EXAM,
SHE DIDN'T COMPLETE
HALF OF HER PAPER.

13:04.577 --> 13:07.079
I COULDN'T GIVE HER
A PASSING GRADE.

13:07.246 --> 13:11.333
OH, I UNDERSTAND THAT.

13:16.422 --> 13:19.800
WELL, WE'LL JUST HAVE
TO WORK HARDER.

13:19.967 --> 13:21.177
THANK YOU, MISS BEADLE.

13:21.343 --> 13:24.930
MRS. INGALLS,
I'LL HELP MARY
ANY WAY I CAN.

13:25.097 --> 13:26.640
I KNOW YOU WILL.
THANK YOU.

13:26.807 --> 13:28.684
YOU'RE WELCOME.
GOOD-BYE.

13:28.851 --> 13:30.102
GOOD-BYE.

13:34.815 --> 13:41.405
[DOOR CLOSES]

13:41.572 --> 13:43.866
CHARLES...

13:44.033 --> 13:45.993
MM-HMM?

13:46.160 --> 13:48.787
ARE YOU AWAKE?

13:48.954 --> 13:51.916
NO. I'M SOUND
ASLEEP.

13:52.082 --> 13:56.212
I WENT TO SEE
MISS BEADLE TODAY.

13:56.378 --> 13:58.797
YEAH. WHY DON'T YOU
TELL ME ABOUT IT
WHILE YOU GO TO SLEEP?

13:58.964 --> 14:03.469
CHARLES, MARY IS HAVING
A LOT OF TROUBLE.

14:05.971 --> 14:07.890
WHAT KIND
OF TROUBLE?

14:08.057 --> 14:11.268
SHE JUST ISN'T ABLE
TO KEEP UP WITH THE WORK.

14:11.435 --> 14:13.896
WELL, SHE'S GOT THE BEST
TEACHER IN MINNESOTA
RIGHT HERE IN THE HOUSE.

14:14.063 --> 14:15.481
CERTAINLY BETWEEN
THE TWO OF YOU--

14:15.648 --> 14:17.149
I TRIED TO HELP HER
TONIGHT.

14:17.316 --> 14:20.736
MISS BEADLE IS RIGHT.
SHE DOESN'T KNOW
HALF THE MATERIAL.

14:20.903 --> 14:21.987
ALL CHILDREN
HAVE TROUBLE

14:22.154 --> 14:23.989
WITH THEIR STUDIES
FROM TIME TO TIME.

14:24.156 --> 14:27.409
CHARLES, MARY MAY HAVE
TO BE KEPT BACK A YEAR.

14:27.576 --> 14:31.038
MISS BEADLE SAID SHE'S
GOING TO BE LEFT DOWN?

14:31.205 --> 14:33.916
SHE MAY NOT HAVE
ANY CHOICE.

14:34.083 --> 14:35.834
OH, THAT'S NOT
LIKE MARY.

14:36.001 --> 14:37.503
I BET IT'S A BOY.

14:37.670 --> 14:39.004
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT,

14:39.171 --> 14:41.465
BUT MISS BEADLE SAYS
THERE'S NO SIGN OF THAT.

14:41.632 --> 14:45.219
MARY WORKS HARD.
SHE JUST ISN'T ABLE
TO DO WELL.

14:48.889 --> 14:50.099
WELL, WE'LL TALK
TO HER TOMORROW,

14:50.266 --> 14:52.643
SEE IF WE CAN FIND OUT
WHAT THE PROBLEM IS.

14:52.810 --> 14:54.645
I JUST WANTED YOU
TO KNOW.

14:56.522 --> 14:58.107
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
GET SOME SLEEP.

14:58.274 --> 15:00.276
GOOD NIGHT.
GOOD NIGHT.

15:40.524 --> 15:41.900
Miss Beadle: CLASS,

15:42.067 --> 15:43.944
FOR THOSE OF YOU
WHO ARE ENTERED IN
THE HISTORY COMPETITION,

15:44.111 --> 15:47.698
I'VE LISTED SEVERAL DATES
HERE ON THE BOARD FOR REVIEW.

15:47.865 --> 15:51.118
NOW, WHO WOULD LIKE
TO TAKE THE FIRST DATE...

15:51.285 --> 15:53.245
AND GIVE ME
ITS SIGNIFICANCE?

15:59.043 --> 16:00.085
NELLIE?

16:00.252 --> 16:04.131
1588. THE DEFEAT OF
THE SPANISH ARMADA.

16:04.298 --> 16:05.257
IT MARKED
THE BEGINNING

16:05.424 --> 16:07.301
OF ENGLAND'S POWER
OVER THE SEAS.

16:07.468 --> 16:09.178
VERY GOOD, NELLIE.

16:09.345 --> 16:12.431
NOW, WHO WOULD LIKE
TO TAKE THE SECOND DATE?

16:19.063 --> 16:20.064
WILLIE?

16:20.230 --> 16:25.402
IN 1492, COLUMBUS
DISCOVERED AMERICA.

16:25.569 --> 16:28.238
THAT'S RIGHT.

16:28.405 --> 16:29.990
ANYBODY KNOWS
THAT ONE.

16:30.157 --> 16:32.159
HE ALWAYS TAKES
THE EASY ONES.

16:32.326 --> 16:33.661
LAURA?

16:33.827 --> 16:36.205
SHH.

16:37.831 --> 16:40.417
ALL RIGHT, WHO WOULD LIKE
TO TAKE THIS ONE?

16:44.046 --> 16:48.717
NOW, I KNOW YOU KNOW IT.
IT WAS ON YOUR LAST ASSIGNMENT.

16:54.890 --> 16:57.559
MARY?

16:57.726 --> 17:01.146
WOULD YOU LIKE
TO TRY THIS ONE?

17:15.786 --> 17:17.705
I--I'M SORRY, MISS BEADLE.

17:17.871 --> 17:20.666
I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER.

17:25.587 --> 17:26.547
NELLIE?

17:26.714 --> 17:29.049
1607. THE FOUNDING
OF JAMESTOWN,

17:29.216 --> 17:31.552
THE FIRST PERMANENT
SETTLEMENT IN
NORTH AMERICA,

17:31.719 --> 17:34.847
UNDER THE
LEADERSHIP OF
CAPTAIN JOHN SMITH.

17:35.013 --> 17:37.391
THAT'S RIGHT, NELLIE.

17:44.314 --> 17:45.566
MISS BEADLE SAYS

17:45.733 --> 17:47.693
I'LL GET EXTRA CREDIT
FOR MY HISTORY RECITATIONS.

17:47.860 --> 17:49.361
THAT'S VERY NICE,
NELLIE.

17:49.528 --> 17:51.739
MY MOTHER SAYS
HISTORY'S <i>THE</i> MOST
IMPORTANT SUBJECT.

17:51.905 --> 17:54.283
THAT'S WHY <i>I 'M</i> GOING
TO WIN THE HISTORY AWARD.

17:54.450 --> 17:57.077
I KNOW SHE'LL GIVE ME
SOMETHING NICE.

17:57.244 --> 17:58.704
CHRISTY WANTS TO PLAY
TWO-CAT. WE NEED ONE MORE.

17:58.871 --> 18:00.038
I CAN'T.

18:00.205 --> 18:02.166
I HAVE TO FINISH
MY CHORES EARLY
SO I CAN STUDY.

18:02.332 --> 18:05.043
YES, YOU'D BETTER STUDY.
YOU HAVEN'T BEEN DOING
WELL AT ALL.

18:05.210 --> 18:08.297
BE QUIET, NELLIE.
MY SISTER'S SMARTER
THAN YOU ANY OLD TIME.

18:08.464 --> 18:10.340
WELL, I DON'T MISS
EASY QUESTIONS

18:10.507 --> 18:12.134
WHEN MISS BEADLE
CALLS ON ME.

18:12.301 --> 18:15.053
PRETTY PLEASE
WITH SUGAR AND BERRIES?

18:15.220 --> 18:16.388
OH, ALL RIGHT.

18:16.555 --> 18:19.433
YAY'. MARY'S
GOING TO PLAY'.

18:23.729 --> 18:25.147
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
OUT HERE HALF-PINT?

18:25.314 --> 18:27.566
I THOUGHT IT WAS MARY'S TURN
TO RAKE UP.

18:27.733 --> 18:29.985
WELL, SHE'S GOT
A LOT OF HOMEWORK.

18:30.152 --> 18:32.070
BESIDES, I PROMISED.

18:32.237 --> 18:33.947
OH, KIND OF
TRADING OFF, HUH?

18:34.114 --> 18:37.910
NO, SHE GOT HURT
PLAYING TWO-CAT TODAY,

18:38.076 --> 18:39.411
AND IT WAS KINDA
MY FAULT.

18:39.578 --> 18:41.121
WELL, DID YOU TELL HER
YOU'RE SORRY?

18:41.288 --> 18:44.583
YEAH, BUT I DON'T THINK
SHE THOUGHT I MEANT IT.

18:47.127 --> 18:48.879
WELL, I THINK
YOU'VE DONE ENOUGH WORK

18:49.046 --> 18:50.422
TO SHOW HER YOU
MEANT IT. BESIDES,

18:50.589 --> 18:51.548
IT'S GETTING
CHILLY OUT HERE.

18:51.715 --> 18:52.591
THANKS, PA.

18:52.758 --> 18:54.051
AHH.

18:54.218 --> 18:56.345
I GUESS YOU KNOW
THAT RAKING THE STALLS
ISN'T MY FAVORITE.

18:56.512 --> 18:58.180
I HAD THAT FEELING.
NOW, WHY DON'T YOU
GO ON IN THE HOUSE?

18:58.347 --> 18:59.765
TELL YOUR MA
I'LL BE IN IN A MINUTE.

18:59.932 --> 19:01.099
OKEY-DOKE.

19:30.462 --> 19:32.089
HEY, SWEETHEART.
WHAT ARE YOU STILL
DOING UP?

19:32.256 --> 19:35.008
YOU SAID YOU HAD
15 MINUTES OF HOMEWORK.
THAT WAS AN HOUR AGO.

19:35.175 --> 19:37.803
THESE PROBLEMS ARE
JUST TAKING LONGER
THAN I THOUGHT.

19:37.970 --> 19:40.013
I'M SORRY.
I DIDN'T MEAN
TO WAKE YOU.

19:40.180 --> 19:42.099
NEVER MIND THAT.
YOU OUGHT TO BE
IN BED.

19:42.266 --> 19:46.228
PLEASE, PA. I JUST HAVE
TO FINISH THIS TIME.

19:46.395 --> 19:47.980
LOOK, MARY, I KNOW HOW
MUCH THIS MEANS TO YOU,

19:48.146 --> 19:50.482
BUT THERE'S SUCH A THING
AS STUDYING TOO HARD.

19:50.649 --> 19:51.859
I'VE NEVER BEEN ACCUSED
OF IT MYSELF,

19:52.025 --> 19:54.069
BUT IF YOU WORK
TOO LONG,
YOU GET TOO TIRED.

19:54.236 --> 19:55.988
YOU'LL END UP SITTING
LOOKING AT THOSE
PROBLEMS ALL NIGHT

19:56.154 --> 19:57.990
AND NEVER FINDING
THE ANSWERS.

19:58.156 --> 19:59.575
IT'S JUST THIS ONE PROBLEM.

19:59.741 --> 20:01.952
I CAN SOLVE IT IN A MINUTE.
I KNOW I CAN.

20:02.119 --> 20:05.122
YEAH, MISS BEADLE
WILL HAVE A SLEEPYHEAD
IN SCHOOL TOMORROW.

20:05.289 --> 20:07.791
HERE, LET ME SEE IT.

20:07.958 --> 20:09.251
I'M NOT AS GOOD AT
ARITHMETIC AS YOUR MA,

20:09.418 --> 20:12.045
BUT I CAN USUALLY
FIND THE ANSWER.

20:14.214 --> 20:15.841
THERE YOU GO.

20:16.008 --> 20:18.802
YOU JUST GOT TWO NUMBERS
REVERSED, THAT'S ALL.

20:18.969 --> 20:20.053
THERE. SEE?

20:30.939 --> 20:33.609
OH, YES.
I SEE IT NOW.

20:34.902 --> 20:37.362
BUT YOU COULDN'T
SEE IT FROM THE CHAIR,
COULD YOU?

20:38.363 --> 20:41.408
I--I SAW IT
JUST FINE, PA.

20:42.492 --> 20:44.536
THEN WHY DID YOU COME
OVER HERE TO READ IT?

20:46.413 --> 20:47.956
I SAW THEM, PA.

20:50.542 --> 20:52.044
GO STAND OVER
BY YOUR CHAIR.

21:10.354 --> 21:12.397
WHAT NUMBERS DID I
WRITE ON THE SLATE?

21:39.341 --> 21:40.509
I...

21:45.931 --> 21:47.432
I DON'T KNOW.

21:51.103 --> 21:55.273
I CAN'T SEE THEM, PA.
I CAN'T SEE THEM'.

22:46.283 --> 22:49.369
PA, HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE
TO GET TO MANKATO?

22:49.536 --> 22:53.540
IT TAKES ABOUT 3 DAYS.
IT'S A NICE TIME OF YEAR
TO MAKE THE TRIP, THOUGH.

22:53.707 --> 22:56.376
WHY COULDN'T DR. BAKER
JUST ORDER ME A PAIR
OF GLASSES?

22:56.543 --> 22:59.296
MRS. WHIPPLE GOT
HER SEWING GLASSES
OUT OF THE CATALOG.

22:59.463 --> 23:01.631
WELL, I WOULDN'T WANT
TO TRY TO CHANGE
MRS. WHIPPLE'S WAYS,

23:01.798 --> 23:03.341
BUT IF A PERSON'S
GOING TO GET GLASSES,

23:03.508 --> 23:05.594
THEY OUGHT TO HAVE
THEIR EYES EXAMINED,
ESPECIALLY A YOUNG PERSON.

23:05.761 --> 23:07.012
DOES IT HURT?

23:07.179 --> 23:09.890
NO. THIS DR. BURKE'S GOT
ALL THE NEWEST EQUIPMENT.

23:10.057 --> 23:13.060
DR. BAKER SAYS HE'S ABOUT
THE BEST EYE DOCTOR IN
THIS PART OF THE COUNTRY.

23:13.226 --> 23:15.312
IT'S GOING TO COST
AN AWFUL LOT OF MONEY,
ISN'T IT?

23:15.479 --> 23:17.481
DON'T YOU WORRY
ABOUT THAT.

23:17.647 --> 23:19.316
BUT I KNOW HOW HARD
YOU AND MA WORK,

23:19.483 --> 23:21.151
AND THERE ARE SO MANY
THINGS WE NEED.

23:21.318 --> 23:23.153
WELL, NONE IS AS IMPORTANT
AS YOUR EYESIGHT.

23:23.320 --> 23:26.615
DON'T YOU WORRY ABOUT IT.
WE'LL MANAGE. HYAH'.

23:38.710 --> 23:39.544
HMM. RIGHT.

23:39.711 --> 23:41.588
MM-HMM.
ALL RIGHT, MARY.

23:41.755 --> 23:43.882
NOW, IF YOU'LL
LOOK STRAIGHT AHEAD...

23:45.675 --> 23:46.843
GOOD.

23:50.597 --> 23:52.265
EXCELLENT.

23:58.021 --> 24:00.732
OK, MARY,
YOU CAN RELAX NOW.

24:03.110 --> 24:06.738
DR. BURKE, AM I GOING
TO BE ALL RIGHT?

24:06.905 --> 24:10.075
MARY, TO ME,
A BEAUTIFUL EYE
IS A HEALTHY EYE,

24:10.242 --> 24:13.411
AND YOU HAVE TWO
OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL
EYES I'VE EVER SEEN.

24:13.578 --> 24:14.871
THANK YOU.

24:16.706 --> 24:18.583
ALL RIGHT, MARY.
IF YOU'LL HAVE
A SEAT OUTSIDE,

24:18.750 --> 24:21.169
I'D LIKE TO SPEAK
TO YOUR FATHER.

24:23.964 --> 24:25.257
MR. INGALLS?

24:26.925 --> 24:28.009
THANK YOU.

24:32.013 --> 24:33.265
HAVE A SEAT, PLEASE.

24:33.431 --> 24:34.766
THANK YOU.

24:39.187 --> 24:41.940
MR. INGALLS,
YOU'LL BE HAPPY TO KNOW

24:42.107 --> 24:43.650
MARY HAS NOTHING WRONG
WITH HER EYES

24:43.817 --> 24:46.778
A SIMPLE PAIR OF GLASSES
WON'T CORRECT.

24:46.945 --> 24:49.322
I AM HAPPY TO HEAR THAT.
SHE'S BEEN HAVING
A LOT OF TROUBLE.

24:49.489 --> 24:51.324
WELL, IT'S MAINLY
FROM EYE STRAIN--

24:51.491 --> 24:54.244
TIRED EYE MUSCLES
FROM GOING WITHOUT HELP
SO LONG.

24:54.411 --> 24:56.329
WHAT I CAN'T UNDERSTAND
IS WHY SHE DIDN'T SAY
ANYTHING.

24:56.496 --> 24:57.956
SHE DIDN'T TELL US.

24:58.123 --> 25:01.084
WELL, SAME REASON
PEOPLE DON'T COME TO ME

25:01.251 --> 25:03.545
TILL THEY'RE IN
REALLY BAD SHAPE.

25:03.712 --> 25:05.839
FEAR, SOMETIMES.

25:06.006 --> 25:09.176
MANY TIMES, POOR EYESIGHT
COMES ON SO GRADUALLY,

25:09.342 --> 25:11.636
THEY JUST DON'T REALIZE
THEIR EYES ARE BAD,

25:11.803 --> 25:14.139
ESPECIALLY WITH CHILDREN.

25:14.306 --> 25:15.640
HOW DID SHE MANAGE
FOR SO LONG?

25:15.807 --> 25:19.811
OH, LITTLE TRICKS--
SQUINTING WHEN
THE EYES ARE TIRED.

25:19.978 --> 25:22.606
EVER SEE HER PUSH BACK
ON THE SIDES OF THE EYES
LIKE THIS?

25:22.772 --> 25:25.192
SHE PROBABLY DID.
I JUST DIDN'T
REALIZE IT.

25:25.358 --> 25:29.404
MM-HMM. WELL,
WITH THE AMOUNT OF
SCHOOLWORK SHE HAS,

25:29.571 --> 25:31.656
THE TRICKS STOPPED
WORKING, THAT'S ALL.

25:33.366 --> 25:35.660
YOU'D THINK
HER MA OR I WOULD
HAVE NOTICED.

25:35.827 --> 25:37.662
NO, NOT SO.

25:37.829 --> 25:42.000
BEEN MY EXPERIENCE,
PARENTS ARE THE LAST
ONES TO NOTICE.

25:43.293 --> 25:44.794
MAYBE ONE DAY,
THEY'LL HAVE SENSE ENOUGH

25:44.961 --> 25:46.838
TO EXAMINE KIDS
WHEN THEY START SCHOOL,

25:47.005 --> 25:50.467
AND WE CAN AVOID
THE PROBLEM.

25:50.634 --> 25:55.013
WELL, IF YOU'LL GET
YOUR DAUGHTER,

25:55.180 --> 25:58.266
WE'LL SHOW HER
A WHOLE NEW WORLD.

27:00.829 --> 27:03.164
MARY...

27:03.331 --> 27:07.627
YOU'RE ABOUT
TO HAVE AN EXPERIENCE
YOU'LL ALWAYS REMEMBER.

27:23.101 --> 27:25.770
I CAN SEE IT, PA.

27:25.937 --> 27:29.149
I CAN READ IT ALL.

27:29.316 --> 27:31.276
I BET IF I HAD THAT SLATE,
YOU COULD READ IT NOW.

27:31.443 --> 27:33.778
I COULD READ ANYTHING.

27:33.945 --> 27:37.240
BUT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE
TO WEAR YOUR GLASSES
ALL THE TIME--

27:37.407 --> 27:38.908
FOR A MONTH, ANYWAY--

27:39.075 --> 27:40.952
UNTIL THE EYE MUSCLES
HAVE HAD A CHANCE TO
REGAIN THEIR STRENGTH.

27:41.119 --> 27:43.955
I WILL, DR. BURKE.
YOU CAN COUNT ON IT.

27:44.122 --> 27:45.498
NO CHEATING, NOW.
REMEMBER.

27:45.665 --> 27:49.794
LATER ON, YOU CAN
USE THEM JUST FOR
YOUR SCHOOLWORK, OK?

27:49.961 --> 27:51.504
OK.

27:51.671 --> 27:53.340
THANK YOU, PA.

27:56.968 --> 27:57.802
THANK YOU, DOCTOR.

27:57.969 --> 27:59.471
MY PLEASURE.

28:19.783 --> 28:23.411
EVERYTHING LOOKS
SO BEAUTIFUL, PA'.

28:23.578 --> 28:25.997
EVERYTHING'S
JUST BEAUTIFUL'.

28:26.164 --> 28:27.499
THAT IT IS, SWEETHEART.

28:29.417 --> 28:30.502
PA, LOOK'.

28:34.422 --> 28:35.507
LOOK AT THEM GO'.

28:35.673 --> 28:38.426
I NEVER SAW
SO MANY BIRDS.

28:38.593 --> 28:39.803
I GOT A FEELING
THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS

28:39.969 --> 28:42.263
YOU'RE GOING TO SEE
YOU NEVER SAW BEFORE.

28:42.430 --> 28:44.307
ME, TOO, PA.

28:44.474 --> 28:48.645
I DIDN'T THINK

MY FLOWER IN SOME WATER.

43:56.218 --> 43:58.721
I SEE YOU'VE MET
MR. STACEY.

43:58.887 --> 44:00.431

MR. STACEY'S
A LAWYER FROM OVER
IN SPRINGFIELD.

44:07.604 --> 44:11.233
WHAT SHE ISN'T
TELLING YOU IS,
I'M HER BEAU,

44:11.400 --> 44:14.611

44:21.910 --> 44:26.582
EVA, DON'T KEEP ANYONE
AFTER SCHOOL TODAY,

44:26.749 --> 44:28.459

TO APOLOGIZE.

44:42.723 --> 44:44.975
I DIDN'T KNOW
ANYONE WAS HERE.

44:45.142 --> 44:47.311
IS HE REALLY YOUR BEAU?

44:48.479 --> 44:51.648
I THINK HE'S NICE.

44:51.815 --> 44:53.150
SO DO I.

44:56.653 --> 44:57.529
MISS BEADLE?

44:57.696 --> 44:59.281
HMM?

44:59.448 --> 45:01.784
IS IT TOO LATE FOR ME
TO TAKE THE HISTORY EXAM?

45:01.950 --> 45:03.786
OF COURSE NOT.

45:03.952 --> 45:05.996
WE STILL HAVE
5 MINUTES BEFORE
WE BEGIN.

45:06.163 --> 45:08.874
THANK YOU, MISS BEADLE'.

45:09.041 --> 45:11.168
MAYBE I CAN KEEP
MY FLOWER WITH YOURS.

45:27.184 --> 45:29.395
Laura: PA'.

45:29.561 --> 45:30.521
PA?

45:30.687 --> 45:32.398

45:42.157 --> 45:43.283
WHAT YOU DOING?

45:43.450 --> 45:45.035

45:45.202 --> 45:46.578
MARY WON
THE HISTORY AWARD'.

45:46.745 --> 45:47.704
WHAT? SHE WON IT?

45:47.871 --> 45:49.164

NELLIE'S SO MAD.

45:49.331 --> 45:50.207
MARY ANSWERED
EVERYTHING'.

45:50.374 --> 45:51.208
WELL, WHERE IS SHE?

45:51.375 --> 45:52.751
SHE'S COMING.
I RAN AHEAD.

45:52.918 --> 45:54.420
I GOT TO TELL MA'.

46:04.096 --> 46:05.264
HEY, SCHOLAR'.

46:08.767 --> 46:10.769
LET ME SEE
THAT CERTIFICATE.

46:18.527 --> 46:21.071
THAT'S PRETTY IMPRESSIVE.

46:21.238 --> 46:22.156
CONGRATULATIONS.

46:22.322 --> 46:23.407
THANK YOU.

46:27.077 --> 46:29.955
YOU DON'T LOOK
TOO HAPPY FOR SOMEBODY
WHO JUST WON AN AWARD.

46:42.384 --> 46:45.888
I DIDN'T
LOSE THEM, PA.

46:46.054 --> 46:47.723
I HID THEM
IN AN OLD LOG...

46:47.890 --> 46:52.186
SO I WOULDN'T
HAVE TO WEAR THEM.

46:52.352 --> 46:56.899
NELLIE KEPT CALLING
ME FOUR-EYES.

46:57.065 --> 46:59.610
I'M SORRY I LIED.

47:01.195 --> 47:03.697
I KIND OF THOUGHT IT WAS
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

47:08.160 --> 47:09.286
AH, COME HERE.

47:11.580 --> 47:13.790
I KNOW YOU DIDN'T
WANT TO LIE.

47:15.792 --> 47:19.463
THAT OLD SAYING
ISN'T TRUE, IS IT,
ABOUT STICKS AND STONES?

47:19.630 --> 47:20.631
NAMES DO HURT.

47:20.797 --> 47:22.090
THEY SURE DO.

47:22.257 --> 47:23.550
I KNOW THEY DO.

47:25.802 --> 47:28.138
BUT YOU GOT
THE CERTIFICATE.

47:28.305 --> 47:31.225
SO NO MORE TEARS,
ALL RIGHT?

47:31.391 --> 47:32.559
ALL RIGHT.

47:32.726 --> 47:34.686
I THINK WE OUGHT
TO TAKE IT HOME
AND SHOW YOUR MA.

47:34.853 --> 47:36.230
YOU KEEP GOING
THE WAY YOU ARE,

47:36.396 --> 47:39.691
YOU'RE GOING TO BE
AS GOOD A TEACHER
AS MISS BEADLE.

47:39.858 --> 47:41.985
THAT'S RIGHT, PA.

47:42.152 --> 47:43.820
JUST LIKE
MISS BEADLE.

47:45.030 --> 47:46.156
COME ON.
