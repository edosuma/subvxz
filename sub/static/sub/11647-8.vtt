lives as these underachieving fuck-ups,

43:19.560 --> 43:21.915
then maybe we should think about
actually doing something with our powers.

43:21.960 --> 43:24.873
What, you mean like open up
a fast-food restaurant?

43:24.920 --> 43:30.552
No. I mean like becoming proper
superheroes, good ones, that do good shit.

43:30.600 --> 43:31.954
Superheroes.

43:33.040 --> 43:34.838

- I might have to make

43:34.880 --> 43:37.110
a few modifications, just on me costume.

43:37.160 --> 43:39.720
It's just on account of me...
I've got irritable bowel syndrome.

43:40.680 --> 43:43.718
And shitting in Lycra
is how I got banned from the gym.

43:43.760 --> 43:45.512

43:49.520 --> 43:50.919
Fuck it.

43:52.240 --> 43:53.799
All right, yeah, let's do it.

43:54.800 --> 43:58.031
This could be the start of something huge.

43:59.640 --> 44:01.836
