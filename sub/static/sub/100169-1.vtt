00:22.166 --> 00:24.166
What I love about Nicole...

00:24.833 --> 00:28.253
she makes people feel comfortable
about even embarrassing things.

00:29.416 --> 00:31.096
Hey, you look like you care about animals.

00:31.125 --> 00:31.955
Yes, I do.

00:32.040 --> 00:34.291
She really listens
when someone is talking.

00:34.375 --> 00:36.415
- Do you want to sign up here?
- You know what? I...

00:36.500 --> 00:39.670
It's funny, I actually signed up for this
but I never heard from you guys.

00:39.750 --> 00:42.290
Sometimes she listens too much
for too long.

00:42.375 --> 00:43.665
Okay, if you email me here...

00:43.750 --> 00:46.000
- Thank you so much. Have a good day.
- Good luck.

00:46.083 --> 00:47.583
She's a good citizen.

00:48.541 --> 00:50.226
- Just call him.
- I'm not calling.

00:50.250 --> 00:53.880
She always knows the right thing to do
when it comes to difficult family shit.

00:53.958 --> 00:54.958
Call him.

00:58.833 --> 01:00.213
I get stuck in my ways,

01:00.291 --> 01:03.331
and she knows when to push me
and when to leave me alone.

01:07.250 --> 01:08.750
She cuts all our hair.

01:19.000 --> 01:20.580
Yeah!

01:20.666 --> 01:22.246
She's always inexplicably

01:22.333 --> 01:24.833
brewing a cup of tea
that she doesn't drink.

01:29.666 --> 01:32.496
And it's not easy for her
to put away a sock, or close a cabinet,

01:32.583 --> 01:35.003
or do a dish, but she tries for me.

01:36.125 --> 01:40.825
Nicole grew up in LA around actors,
and directors, and movies, and TV,

01:40.916 --> 01:43.206
and is very close to her mother, Sandra,

01:43.291 --> 01:44.921
and Cassie, her sister.

01:46.375 --> 01:48.495
- Hmm.
- Note the wrapping.

02:00.458 --> 02:02.958
Nicole gives great presents.

02:03.500 --> 02:04.790
Uh...

02:07.083 --> 02:09.713
She is a mother who plays,
really plays.

02:09.791 --> 02:11.001
- Lizard?
- Yeah.

02:11.875 --> 02:13.785
She never steps off playing

02:13.875 --> 02:15.075
or says it's too much.

02:15.541 --> 02:18.461
- Mom.
- And it must be too much some of the time.

02:20.541 --> 02:22.131
"...chopped down a Christmas tree..."

02:22.708 --> 02:23.708
All right.

02:23.875 --> 02:25.955
Nice. Two, three, four... What?

02:27.250 --> 02:29.290
Are you kidding me? I was just in jail!

02:29.375 --> 02:30.665
Goddamn it!

02:30.750 --> 02:33.580
- Do not laugh at me! Stop it!
- She's competitive.

02:34.666 --> 02:38.076
She's amazing at opening jars
because of her strong arms,

02:38.166 --> 02:40.166
which I've always found very sexy.

02:40.500 --> 02:42.460
She keeps the fridge over-full.

02:42.541 --> 02:44.381
No one is ever hungry in our house.

02:45.500 --> 02:46.790
She can drive a stick.

02:50.125 --> 02:51.125
How could you?

02:51.166 --> 02:53.126
After that movie, All Over The Girl,

02:53.500 --> 02:56.040
she could have stayed in LA
and been a movie star,

02:56.125 --> 02:58.825
but she gave that up to do theater with me
in New York.

02:59.375 --> 03:01.415
You might as well get what you paid for.

03:01.958 --> 03:03.038
She's brave.

03:06.333 --> 03:07.673
She's a great dancer.

03:07.750 --> 03:10.250
Infectious. She makes me wish
I could dance.

03:10.958 --> 03:14.328
She always says when she doesn't know
something, or hasn't read a book,

03:14.416 --> 03:15.876
or seen a film or a play,

03:15.958 --> 03:19.168
whereas I fake it or say something
like I haven't seen it in awhile.

03:22.291 --> 03:26.131
My crazy ideas are her favorite things
to figure out how to execute.

03:31.833 --> 03:33.083
Let's try it...

03:34.875 --> 03:35.915
crawling...

03:38.583 --> 03:40.293
but also standing.

03:41.125 --> 03:42.955
She's my favorite actress.

03:45.041 --> 03:46.921
What I love about Charlie...

03:47.458 --> 03:48.958
Charlie is undaunted.

03:51.041 --> 03:53.751
He never lets other people's opinions
or any setbacks

03:53.833 --> 03:55.543
keep him from what he wants to do.

03:56.791 --> 03:59.461
And he liked me, so...

03:59.541 --> 04:02.421
Charlie eats like he's trying
to get it over with

04:02.500 --> 04:05.000
and like there won't be enough food
for everyone.

04:05.083 --> 04:07.753
A sandwich is to be strangled
while devoured.

04:08.166 --> 04:09.786
Is your sweater on backwards?

04:10.208 --> 04:14.038
But he's incredibly neat,
and I rely on him to keep things in order.

04:16.375 --> 04:17.375
So...

04:18.666 --> 04:19.946
He's energy-conscious.

04:20.833 --> 04:21.833
Hey.

04:24.166 --> 04:25.166
Sorry.

04:25.750 --> 04:27.750
He doesn't look in the mirror
too often.

04:27.833 --> 04:29.383
I cried four times.

04:29.541 --> 04:30.381
Me too.

04:30.458 --> 04:31.918
He cries easily in movies.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.750
I wonder if it was the same four.

04:34.416 --> 04:37.036
He's very self-sufficient.
He can darn a sock,

04:37.125 --> 04:39.245
and cook himself dinner, and iron a shirt.

04:41.125 --> 04:42.955
How are we doing over here?

04:43.041 --> 04:44.211
The peppers are cut.

04:44.291 --> 04:46.421
He rarely gets defeated, which...

04:47.083 --> 04:48.383
I feel like I always do.

04:48.458 --> 04:49.708
...I've got some carrots.

04:51.166 --> 04:53.746
Charlie takes
all of my moods steadily.

04:53.833 --> 04:56.213
He doesn't give in to them
or make me feel bad about them.

04:57.208 --> 04:58.458
He's a great dresser.

04:58.750 --> 05:02.040
He never looks embarrassing,
which is hard for a man.

05:02.708 --> 05:04.628
Goddamn it, Charlie, get it together!

05:04.708 --> 05:06.078
He's very competitive.

05:06.166 --> 05:07.416
Oh, come on!

05:07.916 --> 05:10.536
- What's this? Who owns Baltic Avenue?
- Me.

05:10.625 --> 05:11.665
How much is it?

05:11.750 --> 05:13.630
- I don't have enough.
- $450.

05:13.708 --> 05:16.168
Okay, so I'm done?
I'm done, right? That's it?

05:17.000 --> 05:18.790
This is so frustrating!

05:19.375 --> 05:21.995
This is so frustrating. I always lose.

05:23.041 --> 05:24.517
- Dad.
- He loves being a dad.

05:24.541 --> 05:27.711
He loves all the things you're supposed
to hate, like the tantrums,

05:27.791 --> 05:29.041
the waking up at night.

05:30.833 --> 05:32.043
I had a bad dream.

05:34.083 --> 05:35.083
It's okay.

05:38.875 --> 05:41.075
It's almost annoying
how much he likes it,

05:41.166 --> 05:43.166
but... then, it's mostly nice.

05:43.250 --> 05:44.920
Dad, stay.

06:14.041 --> 06:16.171
He disappears into his own world.

06:17.375 --> 06:18.535
Shit.

06:18.625 --> 06:20.345
- What's "shit?"
- This is our stop.

06:20.541 --> 06:22.831
He and Henry
are alike in that way.

06:24.958 --> 06:28.078
He can tell people when they have food
in their teeth or on their face

06:28.166 --> 06:30.246
in a way that doesn't make them feel bad.

06:31.000 --> 06:32.000
Perfect.

06:32.583 --> 06:34.133
Charlie is self-made.

06:34.666 --> 06:35.706
His parents...

06:36.291 --> 06:37.921
I only met them once, but...

06:38.625 --> 06:42.375
he told me there was a lot of alcohol
and some violence in his childhood.

06:43.583 --> 06:46.303
As soon as she comes with a lookout,
they're coming with a camcorder.

06:46.333 --> 06:47.851
- Camcorder.
- Is that what they're called?

06:47.875 --> 06:50.825
He moved to New York from Indiana
with no safety net,

06:50.916 --> 06:53.166
and now he's more New Yorker
than any New Yorker.

06:53.250 --> 06:55.130
I made sure they used
the right almond milk.

06:55.208 --> 06:56.038
Genius.

06:56.125 --> 06:59.495
He's brilliant at creating family
out of whoever is around.

07:01.875 --> 07:05.575
With the theater company, he cast a spell
that made everyone feel included.

07:06.208 --> 07:08.208
No one, not even an intern,
was unimportant.

07:08.291 --> 07:10.631
He could remember all the inside jokes.

07:10.708 --> 07:13.248
And where do you go when it's windy?

07:13.708 --> 07:15.498
Oh, yeah, that... that was funny.

07:19.500 --> 07:22.580
He's extremely organized
and thorough.

07:23.375 --> 07:25.575
He's very clear about what he wants,

07:25.666 --> 07:27.876
unlike me, who can't always tell.

07:28.625 --> 07:29.785
Let's stop right there.

07:50.458 --> 07:51.498
Who wants to start?

07:59.166 --> 08:00.786
I-I'm not going to read this out loud.

08:03.458 --> 08:04.458
Why is that?

08:04.958 --> 08:06.668
Because I don't like what I wrote.

08:08.250 --> 08:11.290
As we mediate your separation

08:11.625 --> 08:13.785
and eventual divorce,

08:14.583 --> 08:17.383
things can get quite contentious.

08:17.458 --> 08:20.788
So, I like to begin
with a note of positivity,

08:21.375 --> 08:25.415
for the people I work with to remember
why they got married in the first place.

08:25.791 --> 08:28.461
And so that, as you come apart,

08:28.541 --> 08:30.251
you're reminded that...

08:31.083 --> 08:33.962
this is a person
you had great feeling for,

08:34.666 --> 08:37.126
and maybe still do in many ways.

08:40.416 --> 08:42.626
I'll read mine. I like what I wrote.

08:44.125 --> 08:45.415
For it to really work,

08:45.916 --> 08:47.286
you both have to read.

08:47.375 --> 08:48.575
I'm not going to.

08:49.500 --> 08:50.710
Okay, um...

08:51.375 --> 08:55.035
I just think it's a shame
that you guys aren't going to get to hear,

08:55.541 --> 08:57.581
uh, the wonderful things
you wrote about each other.

08:58.166 --> 09:00.826
She always says I can't write,
but I think mine's pretty good.

09:00.916 --> 09:03.351
Nicole, maybe you'd change your mind
once you heard Charlie's.

09:03.375 --> 09:04.785
I don't want to hear Charlie's.

09:04.875 --> 09:06.125
We promised to listen.

09:06.208 --> 09:07.208
That's right.

09:08.333 --> 09:10.583
That's the very first step
in this process.

09:12.083 --> 09:15.423
Well, I think I'm going to go
if you two are going to just sit around

09:15.500 --> 09:17.540
and suck each other's dicks.

09:23.625 --> 09:26.245
How can this evil allow moderation?

09:26.333 --> 09:28.293
How can this evil
allow moderation?

09:29.291 --> 09:31.171
How can it be right
to betray the departed?

09:32.625 --> 09:34.455
How is it human to be so...

09:35.708 --> 09:36.748
faithless?

09:38.500 --> 09:40.670
I want no praise from impious men.

09:41.666 --> 09:43.876
No home with them of quiet ease.

09:44.416 --> 09:47.166
Noble blood still runs in my veins.

09:47.958 --> 09:49.788
Shall I fail my father...

09:50.708 --> 09:52.208
stifling my cries,

09:52.583 --> 09:54.423
clipping the wings of grief?

09:55.166 --> 09:59.126
Must his corpse in the ground
wretchedly waste away,

09:59.208 --> 10:00.378
feebly count for nothing?

10:00.458 --> 10:02.288
Must his killers gloat...

10:02.666 --> 10:04.376
Must his killers gloat,

10:04.625 --> 10:07.375
never to pay with blood, for blood...

10:07.458 --> 10:10.328
Charlie gave me the note,
but it's really for you.

10:10.708 --> 10:12.958
- He told me to pick up my cues.
- How is that for me?

10:13.041 --> 10:14.751
Acting is reacting.

10:14.833 --> 10:17.383
I'm responding to you.
You're slowing me down.

10:17.458 --> 10:19.458
Frank, it's closing night, you know.

10:20.041 --> 10:22.791
You don't think Charlie and Nicole
will ever get back together?

10:22.875 --> 10:25.455
No, I think this time it's really over.

10:25.958 --> 10:29.538
- It still feels weird.
- I feel like my parents are splitting up.

10:29.916 --> 10:31.496
It's always been "Charlie and Nicole."

10:31.583 --> 10:33.059
- Is Charlie still giving notes?
- Yep.

10:33.083 --> 10:34.803
You're lucky, Nic.
I wish I was going to LA.

10:34.833 --> 10:37.073
You can actually have space in LA.
There's no space here.

10:39.583 --> 10:40.583
Ladies and gentlemen,

10:41.208 --> 10:42.498
I want to make a toast

10:42.875 --> 10:44.125
to Charlie...

10:45.041 --> 10:47.461
and to our beloved Nicole,

10:47.541 --> 10:51.881
who is going to be going out
on a new adventure,

10:52.416 --> 10:54.916
all the way to sunny California.

10:55.458 --> 10:58.668
And we are also going to try
something new.

10:58.750 --> 11:01.750
We are going to take our play
to Broadway.

11:04.916 --> 11:07.576
It reminds me of when I was a young person

11:07.666 --> 11:09.956
and went to Broadway for the first time.

11:10.041 --> 11:11.041
And I'm telling you,

11:11.708 --> 11:14.918
winning your first Tony at 27,

11:15.000 --> 11:17.130
it can mess with your head.

11:17.208 --> 11:20.748
I mean, I was just a baby.
Elia Kazan was backstage...

11:20.833 --> 11:22.513
I'm going to go over there now.

11:22.541 --> 11:25.101
- Don't do it. Mary Ann?
- ...elbowing Mike Nichols.

11:25.125 --> 11:27.745
And Mike was chatting with Dietrich,

11:27.833 --> 11:31.923
and Marlene, you know,
she usually was a barrel of monkeys,

11:32.000 --> 11:35.670
but tonight she was very, very serious.

11:36.666 --> 11:37.876
Could you give me a second?

11:59.375 --> 12:01.175
Well, I'd have to study it, but...

12:01.208 --> 12:02.208
Hey.

12:02.333 --> 12:05.583
Oh. Hey, I didn't expect you guys home
until late.

12:06.041 --> 12:08.381
- How's he doing?
- Good, good. He went to bed on time.

12:08.458 --> 12:09.288
No fuss.

12:09.375 --> 12:11.415
Read him some of Cricket in Times Square.

12:12.750 --> 12:14.460
God, you guys are so attractive.

12:15.916 --> 12:18.626
Shit. Sorry, I didn't stop that
from being said.

12:19.625 --> 12:20.825
No, it's okay.

12:20.916 --> 12:23.576
I'll pay for the whole time.
We decided to come home early.

12:23.666 --> 12:26.536
Hey, thanks.
And also the travel time.

12:40.625 --> 12:43.386
...conversation
as well as anybody, but I've gotta run.

12:43.416 --> 12:45.916
...if you know what I mean.

12:46.000 --> 12:49.670
- Y-You're leaving?
- Well, I ain't moving in.

12:49.750 --> 12:51.990
We'll be back when you get your...

12:58.250 --> 13:00.630
If you don't like that mediator,
we'll find another one.

13:00.708 --> 13:02.708
- Yeah.
- W-We might not need a mediator.

13:02.791 --> 13:04.751
We'll just split everything anyway,
I don't care.

13:05.125 --> 13:07.205
- Me neither.
- You can have most of it.

13:07.458 --> 13:09.934
We'll get apartments near each other,
make it easier for Henry.

13:09.958 --> 13:10.828
We'll figure it out.

13:10.916 --> 13:12.706
- We want the same things.
- Right.

13:13.125 --> 13:15.125
In the meantime,
the pilot will be fun for you.

13:17.958 --> 13:19.628
You don't think it's bad, do you?

13:19.833 --> 13:22.963
I don't ever watch TV,
so, you know, I can't tell.

13:30.333 --> 13:31.333
Uh-huh.

13:32.083 --> 13:34.833
I told Henry I'd come out to LA
in two weeks to see him.

13:38.333 --> 13:39.333
Yes?

13:40.416 --> 13:41.416
Nothing.

13:43.458 --> 13:45.328
I can tell you want to give me a note.

13:45.416 --> 13:46.416
No, I don't.

13:48.333 --> 13:52.333
Yeah... I mean, yes, I do, but I guess...

13:54.375 --> 13:56.975
I guess it doesn't matter now.
You won't be with the show anymore.

13:57.000 --> 13:58.000
It's stupid.

13:59.000 --> 14:01.710
You're not going to be able to sleep
until you tell me.

14:02.750 --> 14:03.750
Maybe not.

14:04.916 --> 14:05.916
Okay, then.

14:06.166 --> 14:07.916
So, there are two things.

14:08.875 --> 14:12.455
I thought your posture at the top
of scene seven is still too dignified.

14:13.500 --> 14:15.420
- Okay.
- And then...

14:17.125 --> 14:19.625
at the end, I could tell
you were pushing for the emotion.

14:20.083 --> 14:21.673
Well, you know I can't cry on stage,

14:21.750 --> 14:24.250
and I know you don't like it
when I fake it, but...

14:25.458 --> 14:27.668
I thought maybe tonight
it would come, but...

14:28.958 --> 14:29.958
it didn't.

14:30.583 --> 14:31.883
That's all I had.

14:34.458 --> 14:35.708
Thanks for indulging me.

14:40.916 --> 14:41.956
Good night, Charlie.

15:30.291 --> 15:31.581
Mom.

15:31.666 --> 15:34.496
G-ma, summer is for relaxing.

15:34.833 --> 15:37.713
What do you want to do today?

15:37.791 --> 15:40.001
Hang out and relax with you.

15:40.208 --> 15:41.878
- Me too.
- No relaxing.

15:42.375 --> 15:44.575
Nicole has a hair and makeup test today,

15:44.666 --> 15:47.996
and Henry, we got you into Fairy Camp
with the cousins.

15:48.541 --> 15:50.041
I hate Fairy Camp.

15:50.125 --> 15:52.325
Cassie says everyone likes Fairy Camp,

15:52.416 --> 15:54.956
and I think this is true.

15:58.708 --> 16:01.248
Henry, go make your mom some coffee
like I taught you.

16:01.333 --> 16:03.793
- Hm?
- Mom, wait till you taste my coffee.

16:05.291 --> 16:06.291
Mm.

16:06.375 --> 16:07.495
Oop-a-doodle.

16:12.541 --> 16:15.961
Do you always sleep together?
Even in New York?

16:16.041 --> 16:19.211
No, it's just for right now
while we go through this transition.

16:19.791 --> 16:20.791
Oh, shit.

16:21.041 --> 16:24.001
Don't tell Charlie when he gets here.
He hates co-sleeping.

16:24.083 --> 16:26.633
Well, I have to say, I agree with Charlie.

16:26.708 --> 16:28.668
Oh, surprise surprise.

16:28.750 --> 16:32.170
- It's as if you have exploded...
- Jesus, it's early.

16:32.708 --> 16:34.038
...into this room.

16:34.875 --> 16:36.375
I can do this part alone.

16:36.458 --> 16:38.038
Fine. I won't look.

16:39.666 --> 16:43.666
As long as you're in my house,
wake up is at 6:30 a.m.,

16:43.791 --> 16:47.421
and until you know what you want to do,
we're going to do what I like to do.

16:47.500 --> 16:51.170
I can't just go from what Charlie
wanted to do to what you want to do.

16:51.250 --> 16:54.080
Even though I'm 64

16:54.166 --> 16:55.956
and have a dead gay husband,

16:56.041 --> 16:58.791
I manage to get up every day,

16:58.875 --> 17:01.625
live my life,
and feel pretty good about myself.

17:01.708 --> 17:03.788
So, maybe your mom knows a thing or two.

17:04.250 --> 17:05.579
You know what I would do?

17:06.165 --> 17:07.165
About what?

17:07.208 --> 17:10.667
When Charlie gets here,
I'd whisk him off to Palm Springs.

17:10.750 --> 17:13.880
That's what your father and I did
whenever we hit a speed bump.

17:14.250 --> 17:17.290
Didn't you walk in on Dad
blowing the porter in Palm Springs?

17:17.375 --> 17:21.075
And I always regretted
getting so upset about it.

17:21.165 --> 17:25.165
Charlie and I are getting a divorce, Mom.
There's nothing for us in Palm Springs.

17:25.250 --> 17:27.790
You need to wash your face
before you go to sleep.

17:28.208 --> 17:29.208
When Daddy gets here,

17:29.250 --> 17:31.750
- maybe we could all go on the Jaws ride.
- Yeah.

17:31.833 --> 17:34.333
Or I could go once with Daddy
and once with you,

17:34.416 --> 17:36.246
because I wouldn't mind
going twice anyway.

17:36.333 --> 17:38.173
No, we'll all go together,
sweetheart.

17:38.208 --> 17:41.538
Did you know that Universal Studios
is where I did my first screen test?

17:41.625 --> 17:44.575
On the plane, I re-read the pilot
as if I were Charlie reading it,

17:44.666 --> 17:46.626
and I started to think it was just bad.

17:46.875 --> 17:49.245
My agent says it's one to watch.

17:49.541 --> 17:50.541
Mmm.

17:50.875 --> 17:53.205
- This coffee is good. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

17:53.291 --> 17:55.501
What if Charlie is on Broadway

17:55.583 --> 17:57.833
with a play I brought him,
which I originated,

17:57.916 --> 17:59.416
and I'm just doing bad TV?

17:59.500 --> 18:03.540
Everyone is only impressed
when they see someone on TV.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.184
- She's beautiful.
- Her wig looks great.

18:06.208 --> 18:07.928
Where's she been
the past ten years?

18:07.958 --> 18:10.538
Doing weird theater in New York,
downtown shit.

18:10.625 --> 18:12.745
- I saw one. It rained onstage.
- Can I say something?

18:12.833 --> 18:14.293
It was good. Edgy.

18:14.375 --> 18:17.035
Directed by her husband,
supposedly very controlling.

18:17.125 --> 18:19.851
- We're lucky to have her.
- I'm surprised she said yes.

18:19.875 --> 18:22.434
- We can thank her divorce.
- Can she move her hand?

18:22.458 --> 18:25.309
It's going to be hard to roto in the hair
on the baby around her fingers.

18:25.333 --> 18:28.043
Can... you move your hand
further down the baby?

18:31.916 --> 18:34.326
- Where? Like here?
- Off the head entirely.

18:35.041 --> 18:36.481
I have to support his head.

18:36.541 --> 18:39.961
No, no, support the head, of course.
Just try and do it from the... shoulders?

18:41.250 --> 18:42.892
- It's perfect.
- Yes, good.

18:42.916 --> 18:44.116
I can't hold a baby like this.

18:44.166 --> 18:45.786
She's right, that's going to look weird.

18:47.458 --> 18:50.476
It was very important to me
to have this show based on hard science.

18:50.500 --> 18:52.220
So we can see your pretty face
and not ours.

18:52.250 --> 18:55.630
You should've seen me
before the plants invaded.

18:55.708 --> 18:56.918
I say that with respect.

18:57.000 --> 18:58.460
I was raised by two mothers.

18:59.000 --> 19:01.880
Can you lower the board please, Pablo?

19:03.208 --> 19:05.078
Here? How about here?

19:06.250 --> 19:08.330
- How about now?
- Why is there always a flirty grip?

19:08.416 --> 19:10.767
I can do anything you want.
I just need her here two hours...

19:10.791 --> 19:11.711
Can I say something?

19:11.791 --> 19:13.671
Dennis, hold on. What, honey?

19:14.166 --> 19:15.956
She has to know
how to hold a baby.

19:16.041 --> 19:18.476
- Later on, after she kills Donny...
- She kills Donny?

19:18.500 --> 19:20.580
That's a secret.
We didn't give the crew those pages.

19:20.625 --> 19:23.101
...she becomes a sort of a Earth mother
to the plant community.

19:23.125 --> 19:24.665
That's not going to make any sense

19:24.750 --> 19:26.710
if we feel like she's a bad mother
to her own kid.

19:26.791 --> 19:28.211
- She's right.
- Does Donny know?

19:28.291 --> 19:30.767
- Must be nice to get out of New York.
- Well, I'm from out here.

19:30.791 --> 19:33.251
Our daughter, Mia, is at NYU,
living in a shoebox.

19:33.333 --> 19:35.423
She says it went up to 104 the other day.

19:35.500 --> 19:38.880
- We are just so excited to have you.
- I'm excited to be here.

19:38.958 --> 19:42.458
We're going for an early aughts aesthetic,
so having your presence just nails that.

19:42.541 --> 19:43.711
What signifies early aughts?

19:43.791 --> 19:45.461
Into The Girl was on TV...

19:45.541 --> 19:47.559
- All Over The Girl.
- ...or streaming or something.

19:47.583 --> 19:49.463
You are fucking hot in that movie.

19:49.541 --> 19:51.291
- Carol.
- Fuck it, I speak my mind.

19:51.375 --> 19:53.976
- We're not allowing our son to see it.
- Because you show your tits.

19:54.000 --> 19:54.880
- Carol!
- Yeah.

19:54.958 --> 19:56.578
- Dennis.
- This is Carter Mitchum.

19:56.666 --> 19:59.076
He's a futurist at UCLA.

19:59.166 --> 20:02.626
He's consulting on all the environmental
stuff for the show so it's accurate.

20:02.708 --> 20:04.288
- Nice to meet you.
- Is it?

20:04.375 --> 20:05.245
- What?
- Accurate?

20:05.333 --> 20:06.333
So far, none of it.

20:06.916 --> 20:09.536
This pilot will go.
So get ready to move back to LA.

20:09.625 --> 20:12.415
Listen, everything you were saying
back there was absolutely right.

20:12.500 --> 20:15.601
- If she's a bad mom, we lose the audience.
- Nobody knows we're killing Donny,

20:15.625 --> 20:17.285
- including Donny.
- I... I thought...

20:17.375 --> 20:20.245
Let us know if you'd like to be part
of our writer's room.

20:20.333 --> 20:22.463
I bet you'd be really helpful, actually.

20:22.541 --> 20:23.921
Or I could direct.

20:24.041 --> 20:26.421
- No, yeah.
- Sorry, what? Maybe that sounds crazy.

20:26.500 --> 20:27.670
No, do you have a reel?

20:28.208 --> 20:32.248
No, because I've... I've never done it.
I watched my husband do it for years.

20:32.583 --> 20:34.083
Almost ex-husband.

20:34.166 --> 20:37.206
Oh, what's the opposite of fiancé?

20:37.291 --> 20:39.091
Dennis and I will talk
to your agent about it.

20:39.125 --> 20:42.455
At our theater I always wanted to direct,
and then Charlie would say something like,

20:42.541 --> 20:44.381
"The next one,"
but he was always the director,

20:44.416 --> 20:45.916
so there never was a next one.

20:46.791 --> 20:49.961
I don't know. Maybe if we'd
stayed married, there would've been.

20:50.041 --> 20:52.751
Yeah, no. We're going
to kill him off. It seems unlikely...

20:55.708 --> 20:56.948
I'm going to give you a number.

20:57.000 --> 20:59.750
Okay, is it a therapist?
Because I have a therapist.

21:00.041 --> 21:02.671
Well, it's my mom's therapist.
We share her.

21:02.750 --> 21:05.460
She's a lawyer. She represented me
when I left Dennis.

21:06.125 --> 21:07.125
Oh.

21:07.250 --> 21:08.670
You and Dennis are divorced?

21:08.750 --> 21:09.880
Since 2013.

21:09.958 --> 21:11.168
You still work together.

21:11.625 --> 21:12.535
That's nice.

21:12.625 --> 21:14.035
Oh, no, he's a fucking cocksucker.

21:14.125 --> 21:16.625
Nora got me half of this project
in the settlement.

21:16.708 --> 21:17.708
Oh.

21:17.875 --> 21:20.205
Well, we talked about doing it
without lawyers.

21:20.500 --> 21:22.380
My sister had me meet
a bunch of them already,

21:22.458 --> 21:24.958
and I... just... hated them.

21:25.500 --> 21:26.500
Call Nora.

21:27.291 --> 21:28.581
She saved my life.

21:30.083 --> 21:31.083
Sorry, I...

21:31.333 --> 21:32.333
look so schleppy.

21:32.375 --> 21:34.285
I had an event at my kid's school.

21:35.416 --> 21:36.786
Let me get this out of the way.

21:36.875 --> 21:39.205
I think you're a wonderful actress.

21:39.916 --> 21:40.746
Thank you.

21:40.833 --> 21:42.583
I loved All Over The Girl,

21:42.666 --> 21:45.076
but the theater stuff too...

21:45.166 --> 21:46.326
You saw the theater stuff?

21:46.416 --> 21:48.626
I was in New York last year for my book,

21:49.000 --> 21:50.710
which, remind me to give you a copy,

21:51.125 --> 21:52.575
and my publisher took me.

21:52.666 --> 21:53.666
Great.

21:54.500 --> 21:56.040
- Thank you.
- You are awesome.

21:58.416 --> 22:00.706
- Well, Charlie directed it.
- I know.

22:01.291 --> 22:02.291
He's very talented.

22:02.458 --> 22:03.458
He is.

22:03.750 --> 22:05.250
They're moving it to Broadway.

22:05.541 --> 22:06.541
Hmm.

22:06.750 --> 22:08.330
Well, without me, of course.

22:08.833 --> 22:10.173
He was lucky to have you.

22:12.833 --> 22:13.883
How are you doing?

22:21.875 --> 22:23.495
- Sorry.
- Oh.

22:25.041 --> 22:26.041
Honey...

22:35.541 --> 22:36.881
You take some breaths.

22:38.041 --> 22:41.131
And while you do,
I'm going to tell you about myself.

22:41.958 --> 22:43.708
If you should choose to hire me,

22:43.791 --> 22:46.291
I will work tirelessly for you,

22:46.375 --> 22:49.035
and I'm always available by phone or text,

22:49.125 --> 22:50.575
except when I'm with my kids.

22:50.750 --> 22:53.500
I insist on doing drop off and pick up
every day at school.

22:53.583 --> 22:55.743
- I understand.
- I've been through this myself.

22:56.541 --> 22:58.671
Thank you Annie. So...

22:59.375 --> 23:00.915
I know how it feels.

23:01.000 --> 23:02.830
- You do?
- Yes.

23:03.208 --> 23:06.578
I have a kid from my ex,
who is a narcissistic artist...

23:07.583 --> 23:08.923
and verbally abusive.

23:09.416 --> 23:11.956
I'm now with a great boyfriend
who lives in Malibu.

23:12.041 --> 23:13.381
Oh, good.

23:14.875 --> 23:16.245
Well, Charlie's not terrible.

23:16.333 --> 23:17.673
No, of course not.

23:18.083 --> 23:21.333
But they ravish you with attention
in the beginning...

23:21.416 --> 23:24.166
and then once we have babies,
we become the mom

23:24.250 --> 23:26.210
and... they get sick of us.

23:26.291 --> 23:27.291
Yeah.

23:29.541 --> 23:31.381
Where do you want to live now, doll?

23:32.000 --> 23:33.000
Well...

23:34.583 --> 23:36.923
I'm here now, obviously.

23:37.000 --> 23:39.540
I don't know
if the show will get picked up, but...

23:40.916 --> 23:41.956
it feels like home.

23:43.333 --> 23:44.333
It is home.

23:45.125 --> 23:47.375
It's the only home I've ever known
without Charlie.

23:48.166 --> 23:49.326
You want to stay here?

23:50.291 --> 23:52.251
Charlie's not going to want that. He...

23:53.458 --> 23:54.288
He hates LA.

23:54.375 --> 23:56.495
We're interested in what you want to do.

23:57.458 --> 24:00.378
Sounds to me
like you did your time in New York.

24:01.333 --> 24:03.083
He can do some time here, no?

24:03.541 --> 24:05.541
He always said we would, but he never...

24:06.375 --> 24:07.375
did.

24:07.833 --> 24:09.003
How old is your son?

24:09.500 --> 24:10.330
Henry's eight.

24:10.416 --> 24:11.666
- Mmm.
- Yeah.

24:12.125 --> 24:13.125
He likes LA.

24:15.958 --> 24:17.668
I don't know if it's fair to him.

24:19.208 --> 24:20.748
I want you to listen to me.

24:22.791 --> 24:25.291
What you're doing is an act of hope.

24:26.375 --> 24:27.535
Do you understand that?

24:28.916 --> 24:29.916
Yeah.

24:30.458 --> 24:34.128
You're saying,
"I want something better for myself."

24:34.958 --> 24:35.958
I do.

24:36.375 --> 24:39.165
And this, right now, is the worst time.

24:40.166 --> 24:41.576
It will only get better.

24:43.833 --> 24:47.043
Wasn't it Tom Petty who said
"The waiting is the hardest part"?

24:47.125 --> 24:48.125
Oh.

24:48.416 --> 24:49.416
I don't know.

24:49.958 --> 24:52.578
I represented his wife in their divorce.

24:52.875 --> 24:54.285
I got her half of that song.

24:54.916 --> 24:57.076
Oh, I don't want any money or anything.

24:57.166 --> 24:58.076
Hmm.

24:58.166 --> 25:01.076
I just worry because we weren't
going to use lawyers, so...

25:01.916 --> 25:03.666
I don't want to be too aggressive.

25:05.041 --> 25:06.631
I want to stay friends.

25:08.208 --> 25:10.248
We'll do it as gently as possible.

25:11.583 --> 25:12.583
Now...

25:13.833 --> 25:15.293
Oh.

25:15.375 --> 25:18.075
Can you tell me a little more
about what's going on?

25:18.875 --> 25:22.415
Because part of what we're going to do
together is tell your story.

25:24.291 --> 25:26.291
It's difficult to articulate.

25:26.666 --> 25:27.666
It's...

25:27.750 --> 25:30.170
not as simple
as not being in love anymore.

25:30.250 --> 25:31.580
I understand.

25:32.916 --> 25:36.036
Why don't you start at the beginning?
Wherever that is for you.

25:38.458 --> 25:39.458
Well, uh...

25:40.875 --> 25:42.495
I was engaged to Ben

25:42.583 --> 25:44.333
and living in LA, you know?

25:45.458 --> 25:49.378
And I felt like yes,
I want to make movies and marry Ben.

25:49.833 --> 25:52.293
Jesus,
I was only 19 or 20 at the time.

25:52.375 --> 25:54.455
I never felt older in my whole life.

25:54.541 --> 25:56.791
Anyway, if I was honest with myself,

25:56.875 --> 25:58.995
it was like a small part of me
felt dead...

25:59.250 --> 26:00.250
or dead-ish.

26:00.916 --> 26:02.246
You know, you tell yourself,

26:02.333 --> 26:04.333
"No one's perfect,
no relationship's perfect."

26:06.833 --> 26:08.793
Oh, this tea is delicious.

26:08.875 --> 26:11.125
- Isn't it? It's the Manuka honey.
- Mm.

26:12.500 --> 26:14.830
Anyway, uh, you were asking about Charlie.

26:15.500 --> 26:16.750
So, um...

26:17.083 --> 26:19.133
So, yes. So, I was... I was...

26:19.666 --> 26:22.286
happy with Ben and aware of the deadness,

26:22.375 --> 26:23.955
and I went to New York

26:24.833 --> 26:27.333
to meet with this director
for this space movie.

26:27.416 --> 26:30.126
But one where they take space seriously,
like...

26:30.208 --> 26:31.998
sex trafficking in space.

26:32.291 --> 26:33.631
You know, it was political.

26:33.708 --> 26:35.628
Or at least they wanted us
to think it was.

26:35.708 --> 26:36.958
Anyway, it just...

26:37.750 --> 26:41.330
it was really fulfilling the same need
that certain fucked up porn does.

26:41.541 --> 26:43.211
Um, but anyway, so...

26:43.541 --> 26:44.711
while I was there...

26:45.625 --> 26:47.285
the producer...

26:47.375 --> 26:48.665
invited me to see a play.

26:50.458 --> 26:53.538
It took place in someone's apartment
with all the lights on.

26:54.083 --> 26:56.003
It was like nothing I'd ever seen before.

26:56.083 --> 26:58.133
This strange...

26:58.708 --> 27:01.168
surreal, dystopian story,

27:01.583 --> 27:03.043
and it was so well-acted.

27:03.416 --> 27:07.286
And one of the actors
was this big shaggy bear

27:07.375 --> 27:10.205
who played all his lines
looking directly at me,

27:10.291 --> 27:13.581
uh, which I knew couldn't be the case,
but it felt like it.

27:14.083 --> 27:16.253
And then later, of course,
I learned that it was.

27:17.750 --> 27:18.750
Mmm.

27:19.333 --> 27:22.133
- These cookies are really great too.
- I'll send you home with some.

27:22.208 --> 27:24.458
Afterwards,
I was introduced to the cast,

27:24.541 --> 27:28.131
and the bear turned out
to also be the director.

27:28.750 --> 27:30.460
He talked to me and...

27:33.125 --> 27:34.165
I talked back.

27:36.458 --> 27:38.878
The dead part wasn't dead,
it was just in a coma.

27:39.375 --> 27:40.375
And...

27:41.333 --> 27:43.333
it was better than the sex, the talking.

27:43.791 --> 27:44.791
Although the...

27:45.458 --> 27:47.248
the sex was also like the talking.

27:47.333 --> 27:49.673
You know, everything is like everything
in a relationship.

27:49.750 --> 27:50.750
Don't you find that?

27:51.666 --> 27:52.666
And, um...

27:53.125 --> 27:54.125
So, we spent...

27:55.416 --> 27:57.786
the whole night
and the next day together and...

27:59.416 --> 28:00.456
I just never left.

28:01.000 --> 28:04.790
Yes, to be honest, all the problems
were there in the beginning too.

28:05.166 --> 28:07.166
But... I just went along with him
and his life

28:07.250 --> 28:10.080
because it felt so damn good
to feel myself alive.

28:11.791 --> 28:14.711
In the beginning,
I was the actress, the star, and...

28:15.541 --> 28:19.211
That felt like something, you know.
People came to see me at first, but...

28:20.208 --> 28:22.328
the farther away I got from that and...

28:23.208 --> 28:26.168
the more acclaim the theater company got,
and I had less and less weight.

28:26.250 --> 28:27.580
I just became...

28:28.333 --> 28:29.173
"Who?"

28:29.250 --> 28:32.500
"Well, you know, the actress
that was in that thing that time."

28:32.583 --> 28:33.633
And he was the draw.

28:34.208 --> 28:36.168
And... that...

28:37.416 --> 28:38.746
would've been fine, but...

28:40.625 --> 28:41.825
I got smaller.

28:48.666 --> 28:49.746
I realized I...

28:51.500 --> 28:53.210
I didn't ever really
come alive for myself.

28:53.291 --> 28:55.041
I was just feeding his aliveness.

28:56.291 --> 28:57.291
And...

28:58.458 --> 28:59.578
you know...

28:59.791 --> 29:01.961
he was so smart and creative, it...

29:02.625 --> 29:03.625
it was fine.

29:04.416 --> 29:07.576
You know, I would tell him things
at home in private,

29:07.666 --> 29:11.246
and they would work their way into public
conversation into his work, and...

29:11.791 --> 29:14.751
For a while, that felt like enough.
I mean, I was just so...

29:14.916 --> 29:15.916
so...

29:16.166 --> 29:18.246
so flattered
that someone like him would...

29:18.333 --> 29:20.503
would find an idea I had worth trying

29:20.583 --> 29:23.043
or a comment I made worth repeating and...

29:23.666 --> 29:25.376
and then, I got pregnant.

29:25.458 --> 29:28.958
And I thought that having a baby
could be ours, could really be ours,

29:29.041 --> 29:30.461
but also really mine.

29:30.875 --> 29:33.915
And... you know, he was so excited.

29:34.000 --> 29:35.460
So, it was nice.

29:36.041 --> 29:37.041
For a while.

29:37.708 --> 29:39.038
I mean, kids, they...

29:39.708 --> 29:41.668
they belong to themselves. It's like...

29:41.833 --> 29:44.423
the instant they leave your body,
it's just...

29:44.750 --> 29:47.580
the process of them going away...

29:48.625 --> 29:50.245
And I didn't belong to myself.

29:50.541 --> 29:53.751
And it was small stuff, stupid stuff,
and big stuff.

29:54.000 --> 29:56.210
All the furniture in our house

29:56.583 --> 29:57.583
was his taste.

29:57.666 --> 29:59.746
I didn't even know
what my taste was anymore

29:59.833 --> 30:02.083
because I had never been asked to use it.

30:02.583 --> 30:05.333
I didn't even pick our apartment.
I just moved into his.

30:05.416 --> 30:08.326
And I made noises
about wanting to move back to LA, but...

30:08.416 --> 30:09.666
they came to nothing.

30:09.750 --> 30:12.290
And we'd come here on holidays
because he liked my family.

30:12.375 --> 30:14.995
But if I suggested
we do a year or something,

30:15.833 --> 30:16.963
he'd just put me off.

30:17.291 --> 30:18.541
It would be...

30:19.458 --> 30:22.248
strange if he turned to me and said,

30:23.000 --> 30:24.670
"And what do you want to do today?"

30:25.666 --> 30:28.996
You know, I just watched that documentary
on George Harrison,

30:29.333 --> 30:30.793
and I thought, "Own it.

30:31.250 --> 30:32.460
Just own it.

30:32.666 --> 30:34.166
Be like George Harrison's wife.

30:34.250 --> 30:36.380
Being a wife and a mother, that's enough."

30:36.791 --> 30:39.831
Yeah, then I realized
I couldn't remember her name, so...

30:41.666 --> 30:43.626
This pilot came along.

30:44.208 --> 30:47.498
It shot in LA
and it paid so much...

30:47.583 --> 30:50.543
And it was like there was
this little lifeline thrown to me.

30:50.791 --> 30:53.791
Here's this bit of earth that's yours,
and...

30:54.958 --> 30:58.288
I was embarrassed about it
in front of him, but it was also like...

30:59.083 --> 31:03.043
yeah, this is who I am,
and this is what I'm worth.

31:03.125 --> 31:06.205
And maybe it's stupid,
but at least it's mine.

31:07.291 --> 31:11.291
And if he had just taken me
into a big hug and said,

31:11.625 --> 31:13.995
"Baby, I'm so excited for your adventure.

31:14.083 --> 31:17.043
Of course I want you to have
a piece of earth that's yours."

31:17.500 --> 31:18.500
Then...

31:18.666 --> 31:20.876
Well, then,
we might not be getting divorced.

31:21.125 --> 31:22.125
But...

31:22.916 --> 31:24.916
he made fun of it and...

31:25.416 --> 31:27.666
was jealous like he is, and...

31:28.625 --> 31:30.705
then he realized about the money.

31:31.250 --> 31:34.380
And he told me I could funnel it
back into the theater company.

31:35.875 --> 31:38.125
And that's when I realized...

31:39.291 --> 31:40.291
he...

31:41.583 --> 31:42.793
truly didn't see me.

31:44.125 --> 31:46.705
He didn't see me as something
separate from himself.

31:47.791 --> 31:50.001
And I asked him to say my phone number.

31:51.250 --> 31:52.290
He didn't know it.

31:52.833 --> 31:53.833
So, I left.

31:55.375 --> 31:56.455
Oh.

31:58.208 --> 31:59.328
Mmm.

32:00.458 --> 32:03.578
Also, I think he slept
with the stage manager, Mary Ann.

32:05.375 --> 32:07.035
That fucking asshole.

32:07.125 --> 32:08.285
Seventy-five...

32:08.541 --> 32:09.751
just 70,

32:09.833 --> 32:11.333
those two zeros,

32:11.416 --> 32:13.767
- seventy-five point zero zero...
- "If railroad is unowned...

32:13.791 --> 32:16.081
- that's zero cents.
- ...you may buy it from the bank."

32:16.166 --> 32:18.876
"Advance to Illios...

32:18.958 --> 32:21.208
- Illinois.
- ...Illinois Avenue."

32:21.833 --> 32:23.583
"Advance..." what does that mean?

32:23.958 --> 32:25.788
It means you've got to go
to Illinois Avenue.

32:25.875 --> 32:28.205
So where is Illinois Avenue?

32:28.291 --> 32:29.291
That one.

32:29.708 --> 32:31.388
So Cassie,
when Charlie gets here,

32:31.416 --> 32:32.936
you're going to hand him the envelope.

32:33.000 --> 32:34.630
Why do I have to do it?

32:34.708 --> 32:38.748
Because Nicole is very good
at getting people to do things for her.

32:38.833 --> 32:40.293
That's not what this is.

32:40.375 --> 32:42.495
I wiped her butt
until she was nine years old.

32:42.583 --> 32:43.793
She's very seductive that way.

32:43.875 --> 32:46.665
No, Mom, legally,
I can't be the one who serves him.

32:46.750 --> 32:48.960
But still, what I'm saying is true.

32:49.041 --> 32:51.921
Do I have to actually hand him
the envelope?

32:52.000 --> 32:54.726
Yes, but I'm going to tell him in advance
that they're divorce papers.

32:54.750 --> 32:57.880
Nora says it doesn't have to be so formal.
Where's Henry?

32:58.166 --> 33:01.036
He's playing in the living room
with Sam, and Jules, and Molly.

33:01.125 --> 33:03.351
Let's get them upstairs.
Charlie's going to be here soon.

33:03.375 --> 33:04.415
Sam, go upstairs.

33:04.458 --> 33:06.708
So, I'll tell Charlie
what's happening,

33:06.791 --> 33:09.711
and, Cassie,
you then hand him the envelope.

33:09.791 --> 33:10.791
Okay...

33:11.208 --> 33:12.078
I just get nervous.

33:12.166 --> 33:14.376
Well, can you un-serve?

33:15.125 --> 33:17.535
- What do you mean? Like take it back?
- Yeah.

33:18.583 --> 33:19.923
- I think so.
- You should check.

33:20.000 --> 33:22.710
- In case we change our minds...
- I'm not going to change my mind.

33:22.791 --> 33:25.517
- ...or we feel too bad for him.
- Maybe in case I do something wrong.

33:25.541 --> 33:27.461
Now you're both
just making me feel bad, okay?

33:27.541 --> 33:28.921
Sorry, sorry, I'm nervous!

33:29.000 --> 33:30.790
Well, we all are.

33:30.916 --> 33:32.666
And we love Charlie.

33:32.750 --> 33:34.630
You have to stop loving him, Mom.

33:34.708 --> 33:36.538
You can't be friends with him anymore.

33:36.625 --> 33:39.035
Charlie and I have our own relationship...

33:39.125 --> 33:41.285
...independent of your marriage.

33:41.583 --> 33:43.083
Just like I'm still friends

33:43.166 --> 33:45.036
with Cassie's ex, Jeff.

33:45.125 --> 33:46.495
Are you still seeing Jeff?

33:46.875 --> 33:48.705
An occasional lunch.

33:48.791 --> 33:50.041
I can't believe you!

33:50.125 --> 33:51.955
He still wants his camera back,
by the way.

33:52.041 --> 33:55.171
Listen, nothing can be independent
of our marriage right now.

33:55.250 --> 33:58.290
I can't believe I even have to explain
this to you. Just be on my side, okay?

33:58.375 --> 33:59.745
- Okay.
- And...

34:00.333 --> 34:01.543
stop seeing Jeff!

34:03.291 --> 34:05.921
Cassie, you're the server.

34:06.000 --> 34:08.330
Just let me practice a few times.

34:08.708 --> 34:10.378
I was never a good auditioner.

34:10.458 --> 34:13.208
- That's because you wanted it too badly.
- It's not an audition.

34:13.291 --> 34:17.081
- I'll play Charlie.
- It's just my palms are so perspired.

34:17.208 --> 34:19.538
Sweetie, you're blotting the envelope.

34:19.625 --> 34:21.574
Maybe Nicole should play you.

34:21.666 --> 34:22.826
Did you really just say that?

34:22.916 --> 34:25.076
We don't need to practice.
This is not a performance.

34:25.166 --> 34:26.646
Did we finish the other wine already?

34:26.708 --> 34:27.809
Yeah.

34:27.833 --> 34:28.882
Oh!

34:28.958 --> 34:30.788
- Oh.
- Okay, let me get him.

34:30.875 --> 34:32.391
- Okay.
- You both go in the other room.

34:32.416 --> 34:35.166
Cassie, you make sure that Henry
goes upstairs with Molly and Jules.

34:35.250 --> 34:36.250
Happening now.

34:38.166 --> 34:40.126
- Mom!
- I'm getting my wine.

34:41.000 --> 34:41.830
What?

34:41.916 --> 34:43.666
Henry's pooping
in the bathroom downstairs.

34:43.750 --> 34:45.350
Can we transfer him to the one upstairs?

34:45.375 --> 34:47.745
- I think it's mid-poop.
- Just grab him when he comes out.

34:47.833 --> 34:49.043
- Cassie?
- What?

34:49.125 --> 34:52.455
I'm... I'm putting the envelope
over here by the toaster.

34:52.541 --> 34:53.670
Copy you.

34:59.958 --> 35:00.878
- Hi.
- Hi.

35:00.958 --> 35:03.128
- Where's Henry?
- Uh, he's pooping.

35:03.833 --> 35:04.833
Hi, Henry!

35:06.041 --> 35:07.421
Does this couch still open?

35:07.625 --> 35:08.625
Yeah.

35:08.833 --> 35:12.713
I got off the plane to a text, but don't
tell anyone yet. It's still a secret.

35:12.791 --> 35:13.881
Okay.

35:16.708 --> 35:18.628
I won a MacArthur grant.

35:19.041 --> 35:20.041
Charlie!

35:20.083 --> 35:21.673
Oh, my God, that's great!

35:21.750 --> 35:22.920
Congratulations.

35:23.000 --> 35:26.170
I'll say it because you can't,
it's the genius grant. You're a genius.

35:26.250 --> 35:28.250
Oh, I'm really happy for you.
You deserve it.

35:28.333 --> 35:30.833
It's yours too.
We did all of this together.

35:30.916 --> 35:31.916
Thank you, but...

35:32.541 --> 35:34.291
it's yours, Charlie, you enjoy it.

35:35.041 --> 35:36.171
I'm starving.

35:36.250 --> 35:38.410
It's good money,
and they parse it out over five years.

35:38.458 --> 35:41.018
But it means I can keep everyone
in the theater company employed,

35:41.083 --> 35:42.083
pay my credit card debt.

35:42.125 --> 35:43.285
So great.

35:43.375 --> 35:46.125
Of course, I went instantly to,
"It's all downhill from here.

35:46.208 --> 35:48.708
- Now my first Broadway play has to fail."
- No.

35:48.791 --> 35:50.791
We just started rehearsals again,
and I don't know.

35:50.833 --> 35:53.226
You always don't know at this point,
and then, it gets there.

35:53.250 --> 35:54.750
Do I? Because I don't remember.

35:54.833 --> 35:56.923
I know, it's true, it'll be great.

35:57.000 --> 35:58.500
Okay, I hope you're right.

35:59.041 --> 36:00.671
- Everyone says hi.
- Oh.

36:02.833 --> 36:04.503
Tell them hi. I miss everyone.

36:04.583 --> 36:06.583
You'll see them again
when you come back.

36:06.625 --> 36:08.785
A MacArthur, Broadway...

36:08.875 --> 36:10.285
It's so exciting.

36:10.833 --> 36:12.503
Congratulations, Charlie.

36:19.291 --> 36:20.331
Which bathroom?

36:22.041 --> 36:23.541
- What?
- Is he pooping?

36:24.500 --> 36:26.000
Oh, uh, downstairs.

36:26.166 --> 36:27.166
Is your mom home?

36:27.833 --> 36:28.923
Yeah, she's upstairs.

36:32.166 --> 36:33.926
- Hey, how's it going?
- Nothing yet.

36:33.958 --> 36:35.248
- It's me.
- I know.

36:35.750 --> 36:37.290
- I just got here.
- Hi.

36:37.375 --> 36:38.975
- I brought you something.
- Yay.

36:39.041 --> 36:40.711
Mom's getting me a present too.

36:41.000 --> 36:42.880
- Why?
- For pooping.

36:44.083 --> 36:45.083
Oh.

36:46.875 --> 36:48.535
- I love you.
- I love you.

36:49.250 --> 36:51.580
I don't think we should reward him
for pooping anymore.

36:51.666 --> 36:53.996
Oh, I know, but he holds it in
and it's going on a week.

36:54.083 --> 36:56.753
- It's its own reward. G-ma!
- Charlie-bird!

36:56.833 --> 36:58.713
Oh! No! Stop it!

36:58.791 --> 37:00.421
Oh, God, I'm huge!

37:00.500 --> 37:02.580
- You're as light as a feather.
- Mom?

37:03.583 --> 37:07.003
- Why didn't you respond to my last email?
- Well, your emails are so articulate.

37:07.083 --> 37:08.683
I get intimidated.

37:08.750 --> 37:11.000
- Mom, can you...
- Now, I'm going to lift you!

37:11.083 --> 37:13.673
Mom?

37:13.750 --> 37:14.750
Mom?

37:15.833 --> 37:17.083
- Mom?
- What?

37:17.166 --> 37:18.246
Upstairs.

37:18.333 --> 37:19.793
Oh.

37:19.875 --> 37:21.575
I'm going to write you back now.

37:25.541 --> 37:26.711
Cassie?

37:27.458 --> 37:28.458
Hey, Charlie.

37:28.541 --> 37:29.791
I like your haircut.

37:30.250 --> 37:31.250
Oh, thanks.

37:33.083 --> 37:34.423
- Mom?
- I'll go.

37:34.958 --> 37:36.828
Henry's calling you, Nicole!

37:36.916 --> 37:37.916
I hear him.

37:38.875 --> 37:40.325
What's going on, Henry?

37:40.416 --> 37:42.036
Can you ask Mom to come?

37:44.041 --> 37:45.041
He wants you.

37:48.250 --> 37:49.500
What kind of pie is that?

37:52.125 --> 37:53.125
It's...

37:57.708 --> 37:58.708
pecan.

38:00.041 --> 38:01.751
- Did you make it?
- I don't know.

38:02.416 --> 38:03.536
No, it's store bought.

38:04.250 --> 38:05.500
You know Joan's on Third?

38:05.583 --> 38:07.633
- Oh, yeah. It's good, right?
- What?

38:07.916 --> 38:09.076
The store? Yeah.

38:10.166 --> 38:11.416
Jules and Molly love it.

38:11.500 --> 38:12.920
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

38:13.833 --> 38:15.083
I'm just hot!

38:16.500 --> 38:17.880
Uh, I'll pour you some water.

38:19.375 --> 38:20.995
Nicole says you're doing a play?

38:21.125 --> 38:22.625
I-I think you'd like it.

38:22.708 --> 38:26.288
It's a great unproduced play
by this really interesting British writer.

38:26.875 --> 38:28.726
- So, you do an English accent?
- Yeah.

38:28.750 --> 38:30.790
- It's more northern England.
- Oh.

38:30.875 --> 38:31.995
What does that sound like?

38:33.916 --> 38:36.876
Ooh, you want a cup of tea, do ya?

38:38.416 --> 38:40.036
Right. Good.

38:41.375 --> 38:44.745
Oh, thank you, missus. What is...

38:45.708 --> 38:46.788
What's this?

38:46.833 --> 38:49.003
Oh, it's a manila envelope, love.

38:49.083 --> 38:51.476
- Ooh, can I start over?
- It has my name on it.

38:51.500 --> 38:52.500
Ooh.

38:56.333 --> 38:57.333
Oh.

38:57.708 --> 38:58.788
Jesus.

38:58.916 --> 39:01.246
Sorry. You're served.

39:03.375 --> 39:05.125
- What did you do?
- Nothing. I don't know.

39:05.625 --> 39:07.245
I can't lie.

39:07.333 --> 39:08.793
You're being served.

39:08.875 --> 39:11.625
You guys are getting a div...
I don't know, I'm sorry.

39:17.958 --> 39:20.708
I was going to warn you
so it didn't become a thing. I'm sorry.

39:34.208 --> 39:35.578
I feel like I'm in a dream.

39:37.333 --> 39:39.003
We don't have a marriage anymore.

39:39.083 --> 39:42.713
I-I know you don't want the disruption,
but you don't want to be married.

39:43.000 --> 39:44.630
Not... really.

39:46.833 --> 39:48.043
But I don't want this.

39:50.875 --> 39:53.205
What did you expect was going to happen?

39:56.500 --> 39:59.250
I... I don't know,
I guess I didn't think it through,

39:59.333 --> 40:02.883
but I thought we agreed
we weren't going to use lawyers.

40:03.333 --> 40:04.673
I want...

40:05.250 --> 40:08.790
I don't know, I'm trying to say this
as undramatically as possible.

40:08.875 --> 40:10.035
I want...

40:11.666 --> 40:13.706
an entirely different kind of life.

40:14.500 --> 40:17.130
Let's wait until you finish this pilot
and come back to New York.

40:17.208 --> 40:19.208
Let's figure it out there,
at home, together.

40:19.291 --> 40:22.226
- Nora's known for being very fair.
- We don't need to do it with envelopes.

40:22.250 --> 40:23.080
- This is Nora?
- Yeah.

40:23.166 --> 40:25.286
She's great. I feel like
we could be friends with her.

40:25.333 --> 40:28.583
- Why do I feel like that won't happen?
- It's just a formality.

40:28.666 --> 40:30.476
- Why...
- You don't have to respond right away.

40:30.500 --> 40:32.000
Why did Cassie have a pie?

40:32.333 --> 40:34.883
The pie was hers.
The pie wasn't part of it.

40:34.958 --> 40:35.788
Are you sure?

40:35.875 --> 40:38.075
I mean, what would the pie
have to do with anything?

40:38.166 --> 40:40.576
I don't know. It somehow makes it worse.

40:41.458 --> 40:43.788
I'm sorry, but the pie was just a pie.

40:44.833 --> 40:45.883
So, what...

40:48.916 --> 40:49.996
What do I do?

40:52.708 --> 40:53.878
You get a lawyer too.

40:57.791 --> 40:59.921
"Well, I guess
I better be going.

41:00.000 --> 41:03.250
Stuart rose from the ditch,
climbed into his car...

41:04.000 --> 41:06.460
and started up the road
that led toward the north.

41:07.375 --> 41:10.125
The sun was just coming up
over the hills on his right.

41:11.083 --> 41:14.583
As he peered ahead into the great land
that stretched before him,

41:15.125 --> 41:16.455
the way seemed long...

41:17.500 --> 41:18.790
but the sky was bright.

41:19.625 --> 41:22.495
And he somehow felt
he was headed in the right direction."

41:25.250 --> 41:27.130
I forgot it ended that way.

41:28.500 --> 41:31.670
Yeah, wow, Stuart really overreacted,
didn't you think?

41:32.416 --> 41:34.166
He was upset about his boat.

41:38.500 --> 41:40.040
Dad, you go away.

41:41.083 --> 41:43.043
Mom, you stay.

41:43.416 --> 41:46.376
- Hey, Daddy just got here.
- It's okay.

41:47.791 --> 41:48.791
Love you.

41:52.375 --> 41:56.785
You can come back, and wake me up,
and read to me later, Daddy, okay?

41:57.291 --> 41:58.291
Okay.

42:00.666 --> 42:02.876
Will you come sleep
in my bed later?

42:02.958 --> 42:03.958
Yeah.

42:13.125 --> 42:14.125
Oh.

42:14.500 --> 42:16.460
Hang in there, Charlie-bird.

42:16.625 --> 42:17.625
Thanks, G-ma.

42:47.291 --> 42:49.581
- He's in a mommy phase right now.
- It's okay.

42:58.916 --> 42:59.746
Whoo!

42:59.833 --> 43:01.923
I'm sorry. I drank too much wine.

43:02.333 --> 43:04.043
- I can imagine.
- And didn't eat dinner.

43:04.125 --> 43:05.455
Stressful time.

43:06.500 --> 43:07.750
I hope Henry didn't notice.

43:07.833 --> 43:08.833
I'm sure he didn't.

43:08.875 --> 43:10.555
Now that I'm a parent,
I realize my parents

43:10.583 --> 43:12.223
were probably drunk all the time with me.

43:12.250 --> 43:13.250
Yeah.

43:13.291 --> 43:14.461
I'm sorry again.

43:16.250 --> 43:17.250
Thanks.

43:18.333 --> 43:19.463
Where are you staying?

43:23.041 --> 43:24.831
Oh, well, I...

43:26.375 --> 43:27.415
hadn't...

43:31.583 --> 43:32.583
I guess I'll...

43:34.958 --> 43:37.248
There's a new hotel on Highland that's...

43:38.083 --> 43:41.543
supposedly not too expensive
and... and pretty nice.

43:41.958 --> 43:43.668
Oh, okay, I'll check it out.

43:44.250 --> 43:46.540
Again, that's great
about the MacArthur.

43:46.916 --> 43:47.916
Thanks.

43:55.500 --> 43:57.000
- Charlie?
- Yeah?

44:00.708 --> 44:01.708
Thanks.

44:08.916 --> 44:09.746
Fuck.

44:09.833 --> 44:13.083
- What?
- She's being represented by Nora.

44:13.166 --> 44:14.576
She's supposedly very fair?

44:14.666 --> 44:16.456
All right, here's the fact, Jack.

44:17.083 --> 44:20.083
I charge $950 an hour.

44:20.166 --> 44:21.626
Ted is 400.

44:22.083 --> 44:24.753
If you have a stupid question,
you call Ted.

44:26.333 --> 44:29.083
To start, we'll need a $25,000 retainer.

44:29.166 --> 44:31.184
- That's more than I can...
- And all your financials.

44:31.208 --> 44:32.748
We need to do a forensic accounting.

44:32.833 --> 44:36.333
Which runs anywhere
from ten to twenty thousand dollars.

44:37.041 --> 44:39.671
But if we can all agree right away,
it shouldn't get too bad,

44:39.750 --> 44:42.080
- right?
- You were married here in LA?

44:42.166 --> 44:44.456
Yes... because her mom and sister
are out here

44:44.541 --> 44:47.211
- and I'm not close with my family.
- Your son was born out here?

44:47.291 --> 44:50.791
Yes, because, again, her mom
and sister are out here and I'm not...

44:50.875 --> 44:52.415
So, you got married here,

44:52.500 --> 44:54.250
your kid was born here...

44:55.833 --> 44:57.133
and she served you here?

44:57.208 --> 44:58.998
Yeah, but we lived in New York.

45:00.000 --> 45:01.000
Why?

45:02.333 --> 45:04.833
- Is there a problem?
- We'll have to reshape the narrative.

45:04.916 --> 45:08.746
If you're serious
about having your child in New York,

45:08.833 --> 45:10.463
this is what I suggest.

45:10.541 --> 45:13.421
You take your kid...
D-Did you say his name was Fred?

45:14.166 --> 45:14.996
Henry.

45:15.083 --> 45:16.003
Henry?

45:16.083 --> 45:17.293
Why did I say Fred?

45:17.375 --> 45:18.875
I have a kid named Fred.

45:18.958 --> 45:22.498
You take Henry to New York
with you right now.

45:22.583 --> 45:24.883
Then we file an action in New York.

45:25.166 --> 45:26.326
We make this a New York case.

45:26.375 --> 45:28.892
We need to make an argument
that you're a New York-based family.

45:28.916 --> 45:29.746
Well, we are.

45:29.833 --> 45:32.753
Otherwise, you'll probably never
see your kid outside of LA again.

45:32.833 --> 45:34.503
Really? No.

45:34.583 --> 45:37.793
It's very hard
to convince the courts to move a kid.

45:37.875 --> 45:41.075
As soon as you let your wife and child
leave New York,

45:41.166 --> 45:43.996
you made life very difficult for yourself.

45:44.083 --> 45:45.333
Yes, but as I said,

45:45.416 --> 45:47.876
we're a New York family,
that's just a fact.

45:48.750 --> 45:50.750
She's... here temporarily.

45:51.208 --> 45:53.628
Then why do you think
she served you out here?

45:54.291 --> 45:58.421
I don't... know,
but Henry wants to go back to New York.

45:58.500 --> 46:00.460
Don't quote your kid.

46:01.250 --> 46:03.420
He's just telling you
what you want to hear.

46:04.208 --> 46:07.168
And trust me,
he's telling her the opposite.

46:07.250 --> 46:08.750
Let me have the Barber file!

46:08.833 --> 46:10.043
It's right here.

46:10.416 --> 46:12.036
Move my lunch to 1:30.

46:16.625 --> 46:17.625
What's...

46:19.625 --> 46:21.165
"Exit Goat"?

46:21.583 --> 46:24.213
Exit Ghost. It's the name
of my theater company.

46:24.291 --> 46:25.291
You're a director?

46:25.541 --> 46:27.081
Theater director, yeah.

46:27.166 --> 46:29.876
- Anything I've seen?
- I don't know. What have you seen?

46:32.458 --> 46:34.538
Our production of Electra
is moving to Broadway...

46:35.791 --> 46:36.631
which is exciting.

46:36.708 --> 46:38.918
We have to make sure
that money is protected.

46:39.083 --> 46:41.633
I mean, it's theater,
so it's not a lot of money.

46:41.708 --> 46:44.748
I basically put whatever money I make
back in the theater.

46:44.833 --> 46:47.793
I wonder, do we ask for support?

46:48.250 --> 46:49.920
- Interesting.
- From Nicole?

46:50.000 --> 46:51.380
I'm not going to do that.

46:51.875 --> 46:53.495
Does your wife's family have money?

46:54.500 --> 46:57.710
Uh, her mother has some
from her TV career.

46:57.791 --> 46:59.131
And her father died.

46:59.208 --> 47:03.628
Well, we could say that we don't want
her mother to see the kid,

47:03.958 --> 47:05.288
draw her into the case.

47:05.375 --> 47:08.495
In that instance,
her mother could pay your legal fees.

47:08.958 --> 47:09.958
No.

47:10.583 --> 47:12.003
I'm very close to her mom.

47:12.375 --> 47:15.335
- Nicole's family has been my family...
- Yeah, but that's going to change.

47:15.375 --> 47:17.205
And I suggest you get used to it.

47:17.916 --> 47:21.746
- We need to hire a private investigator.
- Really? I mean...

47:23.291 --> 47:25.831
- Really?
- Does your wife do drugs or anything?

47:25.916 --> 47:26.916
Coke?

47:27.500 --> 47:28.580
Not in any real way.

47:28.958 --> 47:31.668
Well, we're not going to win
if she's the perfect mother.

47:31.750 --> 47:33.630
She was addicted to Tums for a while.

47:35.083 --> 47:38.213
It wasn't nothing.
She was up to a tube a day.

47:38.291 --> 47:40.081
Have you noticed anyone following you?

47:40.166 --> 47:41.166
No.

47:42.375 --> 47:43.745
Well, keep an eye out.

47:43.833 --> 47:46.003
Look, you need to be prepared for the fact

47:46.083 --> 47:50.173
that Nora is going to portray you
as a neglectful, absent father.

47:50.666 --> 47:52.876
- But I'm not.
- You live in New York.

47:52.958 --> 47:54.628
You're consumed with your work.

47:55.125 --> 47:58.535
She and your kid are out here, struggling.

47:58.625 --> 48:01.995
Nora's going to use that strategy.
I'm sure of it.

48:02.083 --> 48:03.283
But Nicole's not going to lie.

48:03.333 --> 48:06.213
Listen, if we start from a place
of reasonable,

48:06.291 --> 48:08.581
and they start from a place of crazy,

48:08.666 --> 48:12.706
when we settle, we'll be somewhere
between reasonable and crazy.

48:12.791 --> 48:13.671
Which is still crazy.

48:13.750 --> 48:15.330
Half of crazy is crazy.

48:15.416 --> 48:18.476
You know what people say, "Criminal
lawyers see bad people at their best,

48:18.500 --> 48:20.580
divorce lawyers see good people
at their worst."

48:20.666 --> 48:23.496
Before this is all over,
you're going to hate me and Ted,

48:23.583 --> 48:26.213
just because of what we represent
in your life.

48:26.291 --> 48:27.291
I'm sure you're right.

48:27.375 --> 48:29.875
So tell me the story again.
You came out here to see your kid.

48:29.958 --> 48:32.101
- Maybe I'm not explaining this well.
- She serves you.

48:32.125 --> 48:33.809
- We're friendly, we're fine.
- What a bitch.

48:33.833 --> 48:36.017
We're just trying to figure this out.
She's not a bitch.

48:36.041 --> 48:37.291
Thanks, but this isn't...

48:37.375 --> 48:38.705
We're doing it a different way.

48:39.083 --> 48:41.793
And... I can't even close to afford this.

48:42.166 --> 48:46.036
I've got to get back to New York.
I have a Broadway play in rehearsals.

48:50.291 --> 48:53.751
I was the hot shit at that time.

48:53.833 --> 48:58.793
Young, very sexy,
with a great head of hair.

48:58.875 --> 49:01.495
I just so appreciate that Charlie
gave me this opportunity.

49:01.583 --> 49:03.003
Or maybe I should thank Nicole.

49:03.083 --> 49:05.633
I heard Nicole's pilot went to series,
so she's moving to LA.

49:05.708 --> 49:07.288
And they put Henry in school out there.

49:07.375 --> 49:08.575
Well, is Charlie moving too?

49:08.666 --> 49:09.746
Not Charlie.

49:09.833 --> 49:11.043
He won't abandon us.

49:11.125 --> 49:12.745
And you can't do theater in LA.

49:12.833 --> 49:15.213
Charlie said she and Henry
are coming back to New York

49:15.291 --> 49:17.041
when she finishes filming her show.

49:17.125 --> 49:18.535
I wouldn't be so sure.

49:18.625 --> 49:21.535
Nicole was never going to stay
in New York, that was obvious.

49:21.625 --> 49:23.625
She was probably
planning this move all along.

49:23.708 --> 49:27.038
When she sees an opportunity,
believe me, she takes it.

49:27.125 --> 49:29.245
Well, LA is nice.

49:29.666 --> 49:30.576
The space.

49:30.666 --> 49:33.826
Miss Four Time Oscar winner, sucking my...

49:33.916 --> 49:35.996
Okay, how is everyone today?

49:36.083 --> 49:38.293
Nobody get too close.
I think I caught Donna's cold.

49:38.375 --> 49:41.125
- Sorry, Charlie.
- I'm expecting a Skype call from Henry,

49:41.208 --> 49:42.918
so I might have to step out.

49:44.125 --> 49:46.455
So, Charlie, what you're going through now

49:46.541 --> 49:49.831
is going to be horrible,
but it will be over.

49:49.916 --> 49:51.076
Thanks, Frank.

49:51.458 --> 49:52.668
- Another thing.
- Yeah?

49:53.166 --> 49:57.286
Fuck as many people
as you can right now.

49:57.375 --> 49:59.575
Women, men.

50:00.250 --> 50:02.809
- Take what I said seriously.
- You might need help wrapping gauze.

50:02.833 --> 50:05.543
- It needs to stay tight.
- Okay, I'm... I'm confused.

50:05.625 --> 50:07.785
What... scene
is the Invisible Man outfit for?

50:07.875 --> 50:09.825
No, that's my Halloween costume.

50:09.916 --> 50:12.456
And the Frankenstein
is for Henry.

50:14.208 --> 50:15.408
He's coming here this weekend.

50:15.458 --> 50:17.328
We're going to trick or treat
in the Slope.

50:17.416 --> 50:19.706
I made it more James Whale
than Kenneth Branagh.

50:19.791 --> 50:21.541
- Perfect.
- Can I talk to you?

50:22.250 --> 50:23.960
Yeah, over...

50:24.625 --> 50:26.995
I've typed up the blocking
from the last two rehearsals,

50:27.083 --> 50:30.883
and here are the director notes
from that Danish production from the '70s.

50:31.958 --> 50:32.878
Where'd you find it?

50:32.958 --> 50:35.538
- The library, duh.
- Ha!

50:35.875 --> 50:37.075
Can I come over tonight?

50:38.416 --> 50:40.326
Mary Ann, it's too hard now.

50:40.416 --> 50:42.496
I just can't be with anyone right now.

50:42.583 --> 50:45.503
But we did it when you were married
and we shouldn't have done it.

50:45.583 --> 50:47.851
And now that you're not married,
shouldn't we be doing it?

50:47.875 --> 50:50.915
I'm not not married yet.

50:51.375 --> 50:53.125
You're torturing yourself.

50:53.375 --> 50:55.285
Just make sure
everything doesn't go to hell.

50:56.541 --> 50:58.541
- I'm relying on you, okay?
- Fine.

50:58.625 --> 51:01.205
- Thanks.
- I wish you'd accept generosity better.

51:01.291 --> 51:02.541
Uh, hold on. Let me...

51:03.000 --> 51:04.920
- Hello?
- Is this Charlie Barber?

51:05.416 --> 51:06.246
Yes.

51:06.333 --> 51:08.133
Hi, this is Nora Fanshaw.

51:08.208 --> 51:10.078
I represent your wife, Nicole Barber.

51:10.166 --> 51:12.246
- Hi.
- Do you have an attorney yet?

51:12.333 --> 51:13.173
No.

51:13.250 --> 51:15.809
Okay, then it's okay for me
to talk to you directly, okay?

51:15.833 --> 51:16.833
Okay.

51:17.166 --> 51:20.326
I'm calling because we haven't
received your response to our filing.

51:20.750 --> 51:23.880
Yeah, I've been rehearsing this play
and flying back and forth to LA.

51:23.958 --> 51:26.038
You're going to need
to file your response.

51:28.000 --> 51:30.750
- Nicole said there was no rush.
- It's been more than 30 days

51:30.833 --> 51:31.833
since you were served.

51:31.916 --> 51:33.756
By law, you're meant to respond
within 30 days.

51:33.791 --> 51:35.271
I didn't like the first lawyer I met.

51:35.333 --> 51:37.851
It says that very clearly
on the document you were given.

51:37.875 --> 51:38.745
Did you read it?

51:38.833 --> 51:40.593
Yeah, but I thought
that's just what it says.

51:40.666 --> 51:42.416
We weren't even going to do it
with lawyers.

51:43.416 --> 51:45.666
Charlie, I think I shouldn't
tuck in my shirt.

51:45.750 --> 51:48.726
- Nicole said I could take my time.
- And we've let you take your time.

51:48.750 --> 51:51.934
- It comes out during the love scene.
- Could you hold a second? What love scene?

51:51.958 --> 51:53.288
When I hug Beth.

51:53.416 --> 51:54.416
You don't hug Beth.

51:54.458 --> 51:56.788
I think it's something we should explore.

51:56.875 --> 51:59.745
Can't you just tuck it in tighter
or get Donna to safety pin it?

51:59.833 --> 52:01.713
I also have a kind of a thing

52:01.791 --> 52:04.131
- about, uh, tucking things in.
- Charlie?

52:04.416 --> 52:05.746
If you don't file your response,

52:05.833 --> 52:08.313
we're going to file a request
for default judgment against you.

52:08.666 --> 52:11.206
...insecurities about my figure.

52:11.291 --> 52:12.501
- Charlie?
- Yes, sorry.

52:12.583 --> 52:14.753
Default judgment, what does that mean?
Don't hug Beth.

52:14.833 --> 52:16.934
We'll be able to lay claim
to whatever we want.

52:16.958 --> 52:18.828
W-What do you mean,
whatever you want of what?

52:18.916 --> 52:21.326
Your apartment, your things,
everything you own.

52:21.416 --> 52:22.246
We...

52:22.333 --> 52:25.173
She and I already discussed this.
We don't own that much stuff.

52:25.250 --> 52:26.970
She can have
pretty much whatever she wants.

52:27.000 --> 52:30.101
And it means we'll set the number
for child support at its highest level

52:30.125 --> 52:31.995
and claim full custody of your child.

52:34.083 --> 52:35.083
Full custody?

52:36.833 --> 52:39.463
- I mean, that's not even...
- This is what the law says.

52:40.416 --> 52:43.206
Nicole's not going to do that.
I mean, she won't.

52:43.541 --> 52:45.291
No, Charlie, I represent Nicole,

52:45.375 --> 52:47.665
and she's aware of everything
I'm saying to you.

52:47.750 --> 52:49.070
I just spoke to her this morning.

52:49.125 --> 52:52.325
Well, I spoke to her five minutes
before I got on the call.

52:55.750 --> 52:56.750
Okay, so what do I do?

52:56.833 --> 52:59.133
You need to get a lawyer
and respond immediately.

52:59.208 --> 53:02.578
Nicole wants to do this amicably,
but you're leaving us no other option.

53:02.666 --> 53:04.416
I'll get a lawyer.
Can I get a lawyer here?

53:04.500 --> 53:06.460
- I don't know where "here" is.
- New York.

53:06.541 --> 53:08.881
Ah!
That's what all that honking is?

53:09.583 --> 53:11.623
No, you'll have to come to LA
and meet people in LA.

53:11.666 --> 53:12.666
I'm rehearsing a...

53:12.708 --> 53:16.038
If you don't respond in Los Angeles
by Friday, you'll leave us no choice.

53:16.125 --> 53:17.745
Wh... Which line?

53:18.416 --> 53:21.126
I have to take this.
Can you hold on a second, Charlie?

53:47.916 --> 53:51.036
Me and Mommy are in the middle
of a super secret treasure hunt.

53:52.041 --> 53:54.581
- I thought the plane landed at nine.
- What are you wearing?

53:54.666 --> 53:55.666
Sock pants.

53:55.833 --> 53:57.423
It did. What are sock pants?

53:57.500 --> 53:59.420
He doesn't like to feel the breeze
on his legs.

53:59.500 --> 54:00.330
He dressed himself.

54:00.416 --> 54:02.767
- There are long pants. Can I talk to you?
- It's almost noon.

54:02.791 --> 54:04.671
There was traffic. We've got to get going.

54:04.750 --> 54:07.434
- Why don't we ever do a treasure hunt?
- Henry, can you wait a minute?

54:07.458 --> 54:08.708
No talking alone.

54:08.791 --> 54:11.001
Just one bit of talking alone,
then I'll be right there.

54:11.541 --> 54:12.831
I got a call from your lawyer.

54:12.916 --> 54:15.416
She said you'd take everything and...

54:16.500 --> 54:18.500
custody and everything
if I didn't respond.

54:18.583 --> 54:20.423
It's better if we just
let the lawyers do this.

54:20.458 --> 54:22.578
Yeah, but she's saying things
I don't think you mean.

54:22.666 --> 54:24.326
Henry, we need to get going.

54:24.416 --> 54:25.876
I don't want to go now.

54:25.958 --> 54:28.309
- Have you gotten a lawyer yet?
- That's what I'm here to do.

54:28.333 --> 54:29.883
Come on, Henry. I'm in a rush.

54:29.958 --> 54:31.128
I have three more clues.

54:31.208 --> 54:33.809
Why did you start a treasure hunt
or whatever so close to my arrival?

54:33.833 --> 54:35.923
- Cool
- You were late. We were killing time.

54:36.000 --> 54:38.380
Honey, come. We're going to finish
the treasure hunt later.

54:38.458 --> 54:40.038
- I'm going to be rich!
- Okay.

54:40.125 --> 54:42.351
You're going to go with your daddy,
it's going to be fun.

54:42.375 --> 54:45.625
And I've got a present for you
when you get back as a reward.

54:46.500 --> 54:47.700
He's not going to the dentist.

54:47.750 --> 54:49.710
- I'm trying to help.
- I'm staying here.

54:49.791 --> 54:50.791
Come on.

54:54.625 --> 54:55.625
Henry?

55:01.083 --> 55:03.583
- Got the booster?
- I have a booster.

55:05.375 --> 55:06.995
Oh, wait, no, it's not in.

55:07.375 --> 55:08.375
What's not in?

55:08.708 --> 55:10.708
The seat's not connected.

55:13.833 --> 55:15.503
I asked the rental company to install it.

55:15.583 --> 55:18.333
Yeah, I think they can't
for liability reasons.

55:18.583 --> 55:20.809
- Do you know how these things...
- Let me just... If you...

55:20.833 --> 55:23.543
- There should be a clip to clip onto.
- ...dig...

55:28.291 --> 55:29.831
Ow! Fuck!

55:29.916 --> 55:31.706
- Why "fuck?"
- Something sharp.

55:31.791 --> 55:33.171
- Can't I stay with Mom?
- No.

55:33.250 --> 55:34.290
Why not?

55:34.375 --> 55:36.375
It's my time with you.
I just flew 3,000 miles.

55:36.458 --> 55:37.328
I don't want to.

55:37.416 --> 55:38.916
Henry, get in the fucking car!

55:41.083 --> 55:43.333
I'm sorry, but Jesus,
get in the fucking car.

55:48.416 --> 55:50.576
How do you spell Lego Bionicles?

55:50.666 --> 55:53.036
That's two words.
What does Lego start with?

55:53.125 --> 55:54.165
Just tell me.

55:54.250 --> 55:55.559
- Don't you want to learn it?
- No.

55:55.583 --> 55:56.963
- It's on the box, anyway.
- L...

55:57.041 --> 55:58.041
Then what?

55:58.208 --> 56:00.998
E... You know,
everyone at the theater says hi.

56:01.083 --> 56:02.003
Hi.

56:02.083 --> 56:02.963
Then what?

56:03.041 --> 56:04.581
A "g-g-g" sound.

56:04.666 --> 56:06.626
- Are you excited for Halloween?
- J?

56:06.708 --> 56:07.538
G.

56:07.625 --> 56:09.285
- Then what?
- And an "O" sound.

56:09.375 --> 56:11.495
- O?
- Are you excited for Halloween?

56:11.583 --> 56:12.503
Yeah.

56:12.583 --> 56:14.083
I brought both our costumes.

56:14.166 --> 56:16.456
I'm going as a store-bought ninja.

56:16.541 --> 56:18.671
But we agreed.
I had Donna make you a Frankenstein.

56:18.750 --> 56:20.920
I don't want to be a Frankenstein anymore.

56:21.000 --> 56:22.000
Are you sure?

56:23.666 --> 56:24.706
Maybe just look at it.

56:25.250 --> 56:27.880
It's awesome. We'll be Frankenstein
and the Invisible Man.

56:27.958 --> 56:29.958
Mom bought me a ninja costume,

56:30.166 --> 56:32.746
which is better because it costs more.

56:32.833 --> 56:34.423
Technically, the Frankenstein cost more

56:34.500 --> 56:36.630
when you factor in Donna's time
and the materials.

56:36.708 --> 56:38.958
The cousins are also going to be ninjas.

56:39.041 --> 56:40.881
But Henry,
we went through all this trouble.

56:44.500 --> 56:45.540
Okay.

56:45.625 --> 56:46.625
Whatever you want.

56:51.166 --> 56:53.876
Please take the ticket.

56:58.000 --> 56:59.892
- Dad, you're too far.
- I know.

56:59.916 --> 57:02.576
Please take the ticket.

57:09.291 --> 57:11.581
So, I'm not comfortable
leaving the bags in the car

57:11.666 --> 57:13.851
where I've given the key to someone
I don't really know.

57:13.875 --> 57:14.875
I've been here.

57:15.125 --> 57:18.455
It's an office building,
so you've been to places like this before.

57:19.000 --> 57:20.580
I remember those fish.

57:21.708 --> 57:23.128
A lot of fish look the same.

57:23.708 --> 57:24.708
Can I help you?

57:24.750 --> 57:27.250
I'm Charlie Barber.
I have a 1:30 with Dan Cohen.

57:27.333 --> 57:29.083
Oh, hi. Where's your little man?

57:29.166 --> 57:32.326
I don't have it this time.
I keep my skeletons at my mom's.

57:32.708 --> 57:33.708
Okay.

57:35.041 --> 57:36.041
Oh, okay.

57:36.250 --> 57:38.170
I'm sorry. We tried to reach you.

57:38.250 --> 57:40.040
Mr. Cohen wanted me to apologize.

57:40.125 --> 57:43.285
He can't see you because apparently
your wife already met with him

57:43.375 --> 57:45.625
on the 7th of August about representation.

57:46.291 --> 57:47.791
B-But she hired somebody else.

57:47.875 --> 57:50.205
- Uh... Nora...
- Fanshaw?

57:50.500 --> 57:53.020
But unfortunately, because she consulted
with Mr. Cohen already,

57:53.083 --> 57:55.083
he's legally barred from representing you.

57:55.791 --> 57:56.631
Oh.

57:56.708 --> 57:58.348
- Should we feed the fish?
- Yeah.

57:58.958 --> 58:01.378
- It happens all the time.
- Really?

58:01.458 --> 58:03.748
If you have a ticket,
I can validate your parking.

58:04.291 --> 58:05.291
Oh.

58:05.375 --> 58:08.434
You know, it's common that people
meet with as many lawyers as possible

58:08.458 --> 58:10.378
so that their spouse has limited options.

58:10.458 --> 58:12.498
Oh, I don't think
she would've done it deliberately.

58:12.541 --> 58:13.921
You'd be surprised.

58:14.166 --> 58:16.706
Can all of them, like,
breathe out of the water?

58:18.416 --> 58:20.496
Did you go to a lot of offices
with your mom?

58:20.583 --> 58:21.713
Not so many.

58:23.333 --> 58:24.333
Like 11.

58:24.708 --> 58:27.248
I don't think anyone
would have stealed the bags, Daddy.

58:27.333 --> 58:28.503
I need somebody today.

58:28.583 --> 58:31.293
If I don't respond by tomorrow,
she said I could lose custody.

58:31.375 --> 58:34.267
I didn't know who else to call.
There's got to be someone she didn't meet.

58:34.291 --> 58:35.421
I have a name for you.

58:36.458 --> 58:38.328
Bert Spitz.

58:38.875 --> 58:42.165
He was the entertainment lawyer
at Roberto's agency.

58:42.625 --> 58:43.455
Great.

58:43.541 --> 58:47.001
But then he kind of got pushed
into retirement a few years ago,

58:47.291 --> 58:49.081
and he went into family law.

58:49.166 --> 58:50.996
- I called him.
- Thank you, G-ma.

58:51.083 --> 58:53.753
- He can see you today at three.
- Aw, shit.

58:54.416 --> 58:56.956
We never had this conversation,
Charlie-bird.

58:57.041 --> 58:58.392
You got it. I love you.

58:58.416 --> 58:59.416
- Aw.
- Dad!

58:59.458 --> 59:02.038
- I need a new burger.
- Why?

59:02.125 --> 59:06.415
Because you made us carry your bags
into the restaurant, I dropped it.

59:07.916 --> 59:10.286
That's fine. I'll give you mine.
Get in the car.

59:10.375 --> 59:13.325
Why did you bring me today
if you couldn't hang out with me?

59:13.416 --> 59:15.326
Because I've been away
and want to see you.

59:16.083 --> 59:19.383
Jamie Tuber has a little sister

59:19.458 --> 59:21.958
named, um, Lily Tuber.

59:22.041 --> 59:24.331
- Yeah.
- And Lily Tuber is really bossy.

59:24.416 --> 59:25.416
Uh-huh.

59:26.583 --> 59:30.333
Getting divorced with a kid can be
one of the hardest things you'll ever do.

59:32.000 --> 59:33.880
It's like a death without a body.

59:36.041 --> 59:39.331
I know personally.
I've been there four different times.

59:39.416 --> 59:41.036
You've been divorced four times?

59:41.125 --> 59:42.245
Married four times.

59:42.666 --> 59:43.826
Three divorces.

59:44.875 --> 59:47.205
This last one will stick, God willing.

59:47.291 --> 59:49.671
That's why I graduated into family law,

59:49.958 --> 59:52.208
to help people survive this painful time.

59:53.958 --> 59:55.168
Here's how I see it.

59:56.583 --> 59:59.543
If we get bogged down
in "who did this," and "who did that,"

59:59.625 --> 01:00:01.305
and "I don't want to pay the two dollars,"

01:00:01.333 --> 01:00:04.003
it'll just cost you more money
and time and...

01:00:05.041 --> 01:00:06.131
emotional stress,

01:00:06.208 --> 01:00:08.628
and you'll probably end up
with the same result anyway.

01:00:08.708 --> 01:00:09.708
Right.

01:00:09.958 --> 01:00:12.828
I mean, I agree with that philosophy.
She does too, I'm sure.

01:00:12.916 --> 01:00:15.996
And I always go with the truth,
no matter where that takes us.

01:00:16.333 --> 01:00:18.453
You know, most people in my business
make up the truth

01:00:18.500 --> 01:00:20.020
so they can get where they need to go.

01:00:20.541 --> 01:00:22.671
You're just transactions to them.

01:00:22.750 --> 01:00:24.630
I-I like to think of you as people.

01:00:24.708 --> 01:00:26.498
Oh, okay, good.

01:00:26.583 --> 01:00:28.043
And not just you, her too.

01:00:28.125 --> 01:00:28.955
Yes.

01:00:29.041 --> 01:00:31.171
You know, this can be
a really ugly process.

01:00:31.250 --> 01:00:33.920
But I also believe
it doesn't have to be terrible.

01:00:34.208 --> 01:00:35.578
I'm glad to hear you say that.

01:00:36.125 --> 01:00:37.125
Um...

01:00:37.708 --> 01:00:40.078
I'd love to keep expenses down
as much as possible.

01:00:40.166 --> 01:00:41.166
Of course you do.

01:00:41.750 --> 01:00:45.750
I charge 450 an hour
and I need a $10,000 retainer to start.

01:00:46.750 --> 01:00:49.460
I'll see if I can get an advance
on the Broadway transfer.

01:00:49.541 --> 01:00:52.291
And keep in mind,
you'll have to pay for her lawyer.

01:00:52.375 --> 01:00:53.825
Oh. I didn't...

01:00:56.375 --> 01:00:58.285
- What?
- Well, at least part of her.

01:00:58.375 --> 01:00:59.955
It doesn't make sense, does it?

01:01:00.333 --> 01:01:03.383
I mean, you're doing this
because you love your kid.

01:01:04.041 --> 01:01:07.331
And in doing so, you're draining money
from your kid's education.

01:01:07.416 --> 01:01:09.376
- It seems ridiculous.
- Oh, it is.

01:01:09.541 --> 01:01:10.791
It is, boy.

01:01:12.375 --> 01:01:14.165
We'll have to respond right away.

01:01:15.791 --> 01:01:17.461
Your son goes to school out here?

01:01:17.541 --> 01:01:19.791
Yeah, temporarily. We agreed.

01:01:20.250 --> 01:01:22.830
Her pilot went to series
and I wanted to accommodate her,

01:01:22.916 --> 01:01:25.036
as she's often felt
we do things on my terms.

01:01:25.125 --> 01:01:27.375
Be a better husband in divorce.

01:01:27.708 --> 01:01:30.378
I guess something like that,
but we live in New York.

01:01:31.500 --> 01:01:33.380
Well, with your kid
going to school out here,

01:01:33.458 --> 01:01:34.918
the court may see it differently.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:36.040
Will we go to court?

01:01:36.125 --> 01:01:38.125
No, no, we don't want to go to court.

01:01:38.500 --> 01:01:40.290
The courts in California are a disaster.

01:01:40.375 --> 01:01:42.415
No, that's just how
we have to think about it.

01:01:42.916 --> 01:01:44.666
I'm not sure these are my glasses.

01:01:45.041 --> 01:01:46.751
Where are you living while you're here?

01:01:46.833 --> 01:01:48.133
I'm in a hotel right now.

01:01:48.208 --> 01:01:49.418
No, a hotel doesn't look good.

01:01:49.500 --> 01:01:50.960
- To who?
- The court.

01:01:51.041 --> 01:01:52.961
You just said
we weren't going to go to court.

01:01:53.041 --> 01:01:54.321
No, of course, of course.

01:01:54.375 --> 01:01:56.875
We have to prepare to go to court,
hoping we don't go to court.

01:01:56.958 --> 01:01:57.958
Okay.

01:01:58.291 --> 01:01:59.751
You should get a place in LA.

01:02:00.291 --> 01:02:02.921
And get a place near her.
It looks better for custody reasons.

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.290
She's in West Hollywood.
That'll be expensive.

01:02:05.375 --> 01:02:07.285
I-I guess I could rent
our New York apartment.

01:02:07.375 --> 01:02:08.375
Don't rent it.

01:02:08.708 --> 01:02:10.958
You have to continue to prove
New York residence.

01:02:11.041 --> 01:02:13.171
And of course, if you have a place in LA,

01:02:13.250 --> 01:02:15.630
it's hard to show you all live
in New York, isn't it?

01:02:15.708 --> 01:02:16.708
So...

01:02:17.625 --> 01:02:18.745
what do I do?

01:02:18.875 --> 01:02:22.205
I recommend you spend
as much time as you can with your son.

01:02:23.125 --> 01:02:25.075
Many people fight for that time,

01:02:25.166 --> 01:02:26.576
then they don't even use it.

01:02:27.125 --> 01:02:28.325
They just want to win.

01:02:28.583 --> 01:02:31.133
This shouldn't be
that complicated, right?

01:02:31.208 --> 01:02:32.828
I mean, we're a New York family.

01:02:33.083 --> 01:02:35.583
I think it's all
pretty straightforward. Right?

01:02:35.666 --> 01:02:37.706
I hope so, yes.

01:02:38.625 --> 01:02:40.075
I see no reason...

01:02:40.833 --> 01:02:42.963
You both love your child.

01:02:43.958 --> 01:02:45.128
You respect each other.

01:02:45.458 --> 01:02:47.628
Why this shouldn't be
relatively pain-free.

01:02:47.708 --> 01:02:48.788
Right.

01:02:48.875 --> 01:02:50.785
I think you have my glasses.

01:02:53.250 --> 01:02:54.460
That makes sense.

01:02:55.458 --> 01:02:58.168
- What have you been doing?
- Reading this magazine.

01:02:58.250 --> 01:03:00.210
You were reading California Lawyer?

01:03:00.291 --> 01:03:01.131
Yeah.

01:03:01.208 --> 01:03:03.878
Okay, I'm almost done.

01:03:04.291 --> 01:03:06.381
I wouldn't expect too much from that cat.

01:03:08.541 --> 01:03:11.171
- What kind of pet do you want?
- I don't know...

01:03:11.250 --> 01:03:14.000
I want you to know
that eventually this will all be over,

01:03:14.083 --> 01:03:15.883
and whatever we win or lose...

01:03:16.458 --> 01:03:19.378
it'll be the two of you
having to figure this out together.

01:03:20.083 --> 01:03:21.083
Thank you.

01:03:21.250 --> 01:03:25.000
You're the first person in this process
who's spoken to me like a human.

01:03:30.083 --> 01:03:32.633
You remind me of myself
on my second marriage.

01:03:36.666 --> 01:03:38.626
Come! Come! Come! Come! Oh!

01:03:38.708 --> 01:03:40.288
You have fun with Daddy?

01:03:40.375 --> 01:03:42.495
- We drove around to offices.
- Oh.

01:03:42.583 --> 01:03:45.423
Do you want to see your ninja costume?
It's on G-ma's bed.

01:03:45.500 --> 01:03:46.750
- Yeah!
- Yeah.

01:03:48.625 --> 01:03:51.535
You know, I had Donna build him
this whole Frankenstein thing

01:03:51.625 --> 01:03:53.125
with the plugs and...

01:03:53.208 --> 01:03:55.648
Yeah, well, the cousins are ninjas,
so he wanted to do that...

01:03:55.708 --> 01:03:57.538
But he and I had decided together.

01:03:57.625 --> 01:03:59.305
Oh, well, I can't make him
be Frankenstein.

01:03:59.375 --> 01:04:01.809
I'm not asking you to,
but maybe you can help me out a little.

01:04:01.833 --> 01:04:04.833
I'll leave the Frankenstein here, maybe
you can nudge him in that direction.

01:04:05.250 --> 01:04:06.250
I'll try.

01:04:07.708 --> 01:04:08.708
What's the...

01:04:09.791 --> 01:04:11.791
Did you dye your hair again?
Is that for your show?

01:04:12.291 --> 01:04:14.921
No, this is me. It was this way
when I saw you before.

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:16.790
I know, but I didn't say anything then.

01:04:17.958 --> 01:04:19.128
You don't like it?

01:04:19.208 --> 01:04:22.498
No, I guess it's fine.
Is it shorter? I prefer longer but...

01:04:25.333 --> 01:04:27.543
Oh, sorry, it's just absurd.

01:04:28.166 --> 01:04:29.246
Is everything okay?

01:04:29.333 --> 01:04:30.963
Yeah. Why?

01:04:31.458 --> 01:04:33.998
You seem, I don't know,
like something is...

01:04:34.083 --> 01:04:35.213
Everything's fine.

01:04:37.208 --> 01:04:38.918
Okay, I'm going to check in at the hotel,

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.960
but I should be able to get to you guys
by 5:00, 5:30...

01:04:42.041 --> 01:04:44.501
We're going to Cassie's
in Pasadena

01:04:44.583 --> 01:04:46.293
and trick-or-treating with the cousins.

01:04:46.375 --> 01:04:47.535
Cassie lives in Pasadena now?

01:04:47.625 --> 01:04:49.875
Yes. She and Sam moved there
a couple months ago.

01:04:49.958 --> 01:04:51.358
Okay, I don't really know Pasadena.

01:04:51.416 --> 01:04:54.392
- I'll figure it out. What's the address?
- My mom is looking forward to it...

01:04:54.416 --> 01:04:56.416
- I'll text Sam.
- ...and Cassie and Sam are mad.

01:04:56.500 --> 01:04:57.830
- Mad at who?
- You.

01:04:57.916 --> 01:05:00.076
- Cassie and Sam?
- You can understand that.

01:05:00.166 --> 01:05:02.376
So, I think we should probably do
separate Halloweens.

01:05:02.458 --> 01:05:04.978
But if you're okay with it,
then shouldn't they be okay with it?

01:05:05.041 --> 01:05:07.351
- Let's do it this way this time.
- Do you not want me there?

01:05:07.375 --> 01:05:08.245
I'm fine with it.

01:05:08.333 --> 01:05:10.293
- Okay.
- It'll be nice for him.

01:05:10.375 --> 01:05:11.705
He'll have two Halloweens.

01:05:12.625 --> 01:05:15.995
What am I going to do with him for second
Halloween? Walk around Sunset Boulevard?

01:05:16.083 --> 01:05:19.793
Maybe the hotel has something. Or you can
drive to a different neighborhood.

01:05:23.416 --> 01:05:26.326
The sun sets forever.

01:05:27.583 --> 01:05:30.503
There shall never be another dawn.

01:05:31.625 --> 01:05:32.625
No!

01:05:34.208 --> 01:05:35.998
Lady...

01:05:36.500 --> 01:05:39.500
I require the solace of the shadows...

01:05:40.541 --> 01:05:41.881
and the dark!

01:06:01.250 --> 01:06:04.330
Okay, ready for Halloween?

01:06:05.083 --> 01:06:06.793
- Hi.
- Wow, elaborate.

01:06:07.250 --> 01:06:09.809
Sweetheart, don't forget to wear
your jacket. It's getting colder.

01:06:09.833 --> 01:06:11.976
- This is a nice house.
- Ready to go back out?

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:13.476
- He has to pee.
- No, I don't.

01:06:13.500 --> 01:06:14.500
He does.

01:06:14.750 --> 01:06:16.960
Uh, some of his men are in here
and also Bear-Bear.

01:06:17.041 --> 01:06:19.184
You can keep that Bear-Bear,
because I got another one.

01:06:19.208 --> 01:06:20.888
Does he know
that there are two Bear-Bears?

01:06:20.916 --> 01:06:23.416
- It was his idea.
- David Bowie, right? Station to Station?

01:06:24.041 --> 01:06:25.041
Let's Dance.

01:06:25.625 --> 01:06:28.325
Henry, have a great Halloween
with Daddy, okay?

01:06:30.250 --> 01:06:31.250
Have fun.

01:06:34.500 --> 01:06:36.380
Go pee and then we're going back out.

01:06:36.791 --> 01:06:38.351
I'm too tired.

01:06:38.375 --> 01:06:40.915
Go pee, and then
we're going to go drive to Halloween.

01:06:41.333 --> 01:06:43.173
This block looks promising.

01:06:43.958 --> 01:06:45.288
I wish Halloween was over.

01:06:45.375 --> 01:06:46.785
Well, it isn't.

01:06:47.125 --> 01:06:49.455
If we were in New York,
we could be walking.

01:06:49.666 --> 01:06:52.666
But I like that we're sitting right now.
I like to sit.

01:06:53.125 --> 01:06:56.495
That's true, Los Angeles
does have sitting going for it.

01:06:56.875 --> 01:06:59.455
I think that's why
I like Los Angeles better.

01:06:59.541 --> 01:07:00.631
Because you get to sit?

01:07:00.708 --> 01:07:02.828
No, because I like my friends here better.

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:04.130
That's not true.

01:07:04.833 --> 01:07:07.253
What about Horatio and Poppy?

01:07:07.333 --> 01:07:09.333
Horatio doesn't like me anymore.

01:07:09.791 --> 01:07:11.131
And I don't like Poppy.

01:07:11.583 --> 01:07:12.963
Here, I have Axel.

01:07:13.041 --> 01:07:15.791
Axel's hilarious.
I think you'd like him, Dad.

01:07:16.791 --> 01:07:18.171
And my family's here.

01:07:19.375 --> 01:07:20.375
Besides you.

01:07:48.416 --> 01:07:49.536
Everyone's asleep.

01:08:41.041 --> 01:08:42.041
I need to pee!

01:08:48.750 --> 01:08:50.170
Who gave you a lighter?

01:08:53.416 --> 01:08:54.416
Lift the seat.

01:09:00.666 --> 01:09:02.746
I'm going to have to go back to New York
on Monday.

01:09:03.250 --> 01:09:04.290
Did you flush?

01:09:11.082 --> 01:09:12.082
Wash your hands.

01:09:13.750 --> 01:09:15.290
Will you play with me?

01:09:16.291 --> 01:09:17.791
I'm tired, honey.

01:09:30.166 --> 01:09:32.246
Did you hear me?
I have to go back to New York.

01:09:32.332 --> 01:09:34.462
Ah, watch out!
Whoosh! I'm falling!

01:09:36.957 --> 01:09:39.787
You didn't catch me.

01:09:42.707 --> 01:09:43.707
Okay?

01:09:44.541 --> 01:09:45.791
Why aren't you here more?

01:09:47.375 --> 01:09:49.325
I have to work.

01:09:49.666 --> 01:09:51.666
You know my play is opening on Broadway.

01:09:52.375 --> 01:09:54.325
Is it because you don't want to be
near Mom?

01:09:54.416 --> 01:09:56.496
No. You know,
like we talked about,

01:09:56.583 --> 01:09:59.133
we both decided not to be together
no matter where we are,

01:09:59.208 --> 01:10:00.828
but we both want to be with you.

01:10:01.666 --> 01:10:04.036
But you're not near me
if you're in New York.

01:10:04.583 --> 01:10:06.423
Well, we all still live in New York.

01:10:07.083 --> 01:10:08.923
Yeah, but I go to school here.

01:10:09.583 --> 01:10:10.633
Just for right now.

01:10:11.541 --> 01:10:13.921
Like that time we were in Copenhagen
for my play.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.420
Remember all those kids in buckets?

01:10:16.500 --> 01:10:17.670
I like my school here,

01:10:17.750 --> 01:10:20.290
and Mom says we could stay here
if we want.

01:10:22.208 --> 01:10:23.208
What do you mean?

01:10:25.250 --> 01:10:26.250
She said that?

01:10:26.500 --> 01:10:27.500
Yeah.

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:35.170
Vroom.

01:10:37.208 --> 01:10:38.208
Aah!

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.540
- Hello?
- Are you moving out here?

01:10:58.625 --> 01:11:01.392
- Did you find a lawyer?
- Yes. Henry says you're moving here.

01:11:01.416 --> 01:11:02.666
Have your lawyer call Nora.

01:11:02.750 --> 01:11:04.080
I want to talk about it as us.

01:11:04.166 --> 01:11:05.166
Who the fuck is "us"?

01:11:05.250 --> 01:11:07.330
Let's just get in a room,
you and me.

01:11:07.416 --> 01:11:08.956
That's what we always said we'd do.

01:11:09.041 --> 01:11:11.434
- My lawyers wouldn't let me sign anything.
- It's our divorce.

01:11:11.458 --> 01:11:13.668
They say I could later sue them
for malpractice.

01:11:14.666 --> 01:11:15.996
What am I walking into?

01:11:16.083 --> 01:11:17.463
What are you walking into?

01:11:17.541 --> 01:11:19.171
Yes, what the fuck is going on?!

01:11:19.250 --> 01:11:22.880
I read your fucking emails, Charlie!
I read them all.

01:11:23.416 --> 01:11:25.056
- When?
- I don't know, recently.

01:11:25.125 --> 01:11:26.684
- Shit.
- You're a fucking liar.

01:11:26.708 --> 01:11:29.378
- You fucked Mary Ann!
- It was after I was sleeping on the couch.

01:11:29.458 --> 01:11:31.128
All this bullshit about working on us.

01:11:31.208 --> 01:11:33.078
You know what? I have been working.

01:11:33.166 --> 01:11:34.826
I've been doing the work alone.

01:11:34.916 --> 01:11:36.246
How did you read my emails?

01:11:36.333 --> 01:11:38.713
I hacked into your account, you dumb fuck!

01:11:38.791 --> 01:11:39.921
I think that's illegal!

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.580
Don't give me this shit
about being surprised about LA.

01:11:42.666 --> 01:11:44.326
Surprise! I have my own opinions.

01:11:44.416 --> 01:11:46.576
How do you even know
how to do something like that?

01:11:46.666 --> 01:11:48.626
Surprise! I want things
that aren't what you want,

01:11:48.666 --> 01:11:50.586
because, surprise,
you were fucking another lady.

01:11:50.625 --> 01:11:53.745
It was one time! I think you're conflating
two different things.

01:11:53.833 --> 01:11:55.463
Mary Ann has nothing to do with LA.

01:11:55.541 --> 01:11:57.131
I am conflating, motherfucker!

01:11:57.208 --> 01:11:58.668
You watch me conflate!

01:12:02.916 --> 01:12:04.496
Did you just stamp your foot?

01:12:04.958 --> 01:12:07.748
I don't think I've ever done that before.
I'm just so angry.

01:12:10.083 --> 01:12:13.003
- You look like you needed one.
- Yes, I do, thanks.

01:12:14.041 --> 01:12:17.041
You know, the Japanese are making
really interesting tequila right now.

01:12:17.750 --> 01:12:19.000
That's exciting, I guess.

01:12:20.250 --> 01:12:22.880
- What are you so angry about?
- My fucking ex-husband.

01:12:23.416 --> 01:12:26.746
I spent all this time feeling guilty,
and he's so self-absorbed.

01:12:26.833 --> 01:12:27.833
It's pointless.

01:12:28.291 --> 01:12:30.171
It's a game I'm playing with myself.

01:12:31.333 --> 01:12:34.383
Oh, hey, Pablo. Uh, we met at...

01:12:34.458 --> 01:12:36.498
- You held the bounce board.
- The flirty grip.

01:12:40.166 --> 01:12:42.536
- Here's what I want you to only do, okay?
- What?

01:12:42.708 --> 01:12:44.878
- I want you to finger me.
- What?

01:12:44.958 --> 01:12:46.828
- Just finger me.
- Okay.

01:12:46.916 --> 01:12:49.746
That's all we're going to do,
just fingering. Okay?

01:12:50.375 --> 01:12:52.125
I'm changing my whole fucking life.

01:12:58.208 --> 01:13:01.788
Nicole and Charlie's son, Henry,
was born here in Los Angeles.

01:13:01.875 --> 01:13:05.035
He currently attends Laurel Elementary
in Laurel Canyon,

01:13:05.125 --> 01:13:06.955
and Nicole works in Hollywood

01:13:07.041 --> 01:13:09.631
while also maintaining a full schedule
as a mother

01:13:10.041 --> 01:13:12.831
with classes of swim, art,

01:13:12.916 --> 01:13:15.706
gym, and music, as well as play groups.

01:13:16.666 --> 01:13:19.746
Nicole is Henry's
primary custodial parent,

01:13:19.833 --> 01:13:24.213
and to the extent that Charlie
would like to exercise his custodial time,

01:13:24.291 --> 01:13:27.581
he should be making efforts
to visit Henry here in California.

01:13:27.666 --> 01:13:29.456
Nora, you seem to be
ignoring the fact

01:13:29.541 --> 01:13:32.711
that they lived in New York for ten years.

01:13:32.916 --> 01:13:36.246
My client worked in New York
for several years, that's true.

01:13:36.333 --> 01:13:38.633
But Nicole was born and bred
right here in LA.

01:13:39.166 --> 01:13:42.376
She and Charlie would come here
most holidays and summers

01:13:42.458 --> 01:13:43.748
to spend time with her family,

01:13:43.833 --> 01:13:45.293
who all live in LA.

01:13:45.791 --> 01:13:47.791
She and Charlie were married in LA.

01:13:48.541 --> 01:13:49.861
Would you like to see the photos?

01:13:49.916 --> 01:13:51.826
No, I don't need to see the photos.

01:13:52.291 --> 01:13:54.421
Although I'm sure
they both look beautiful.

01:13:55.625 --> 01:13:57.665
It's my client's expectation

01:13:57.916 --> 01:14:00.416
that after this TV show is completed,

01:14:00.500 --> 01:14:02.460
the parties will move back to New York

01:14:02.541 --> 01:14:04.331
where they currently keep an apartment.

01:14:04.416 --> 01:14:07.536
And it's my understanding
that Charlie promised Nicole

01:14:07.625 --> 01:14:10.915
that they would spend more time
in Los Angeles during the marriage.

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.920
But because of his insistence
that his work keep them in New York,

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:17.880
Nicole ended up staying there much longer
than she ever anticipated.

01:14:19.500 --> 01:14:21.250
In fact, a few years ago,

01:14:21.541 --> 01:14:24.921
Charlie was offered a residency
at the Geffen Playhouse

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.670
that would have taken his work
and his family

01:14:28.083 --> 01:14:30.083
to Los Angeles for a year.

01:14:30.833 --> 01:14:32.543
And he, um...

01:14:32.625 --> 01:14:33.665
turned it down.

01:14:34.208 --> 01:14:36.208
Even though that was Nicole's desire.

01:14:36.291 --> 01:14:40.421
He wanted to maintain consistency
for his family and his child.

01:14:40.500 --> 01:14:42.630
Was this the same consistency
he wanted to maintain

01:14:42.708 --> 01:14:46.168
when they went to Copenhagen
for six months so he could direct a play?

01:14:46.250 --> 01:14:49.330
Now, while I understand
Charlie lives in New York...

01:14:49.916 --> 01:14:53.706
and when it's convenient to his work
schedule, he flies out to see his son...

01:14:53.791 --> 01:14:56.251
He flies out here every chance he gets,
at great expense.

01:14:56.333 --> 01:14:58.543
I don't see any reason
you can't be out here full time.

01:14:58.625 --> 01:15:00.184
He makes his living in New York.

01:15:00.208 --> 01:15:02.748
- Sorry, do we want to contemplate lunch?
- Good idea.

01:15:02.833 --> 01:15:04.833
I'll order now so it'll come
when we're all hungry.

01:15:04.916 --> 01:15:05.916
Yeah. Mm.

01:15:05.958 --> 01:15:08.059
- Everyone good with Manny's?
- I'd love Manny's.

01:15:08.083 --> 01:15:09.083
Mm-hmm.

01:15:09.125 --> 01:15:10.375
Have you had Manny's?

01:15:11.166 --> 01:15:12.036
Oh, you'll love it.

01:15:12.125 --> 01:15:14.745
Just really yummy sandwiches and salads.

01:15:14.833 --> 01:15:16.333
I'll have the BLT.

01:15:16.416 --> 01:15:17.416
Dad?

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:19.000
Turkey.

01:15:19.166 --> 01:15:20.496
I'll have the BLT.

01:15:20.875 --> 01:15:22.575
- You'll have the kale?
- Kale salad.

01:15:31.833 --> 01:15:32.833
Uh...

01:15:40.500 --> 01:15:41.630
I don't know, sorry.

01:15:43.791 --> 01:15:45.291
Charlie will have, um...

01:15:47.208 --> 01:15:48.208
the Greek salad,

01:15:48.625 --> 01:15:51.375
but with lemon and olive oil
instead of the Greek dressing.

01:15:51.458 --> 01:15:52.288
Okay.

01:15:52.375 --> 01:15:54.785
- I'll have the Chinese chicken salad.
- Okay, sure.

01:15:54.875 --> 01:15:55.875
Thank you.

01:15:59.416 --> 01:16:02.416
Congratulations, Charlie, on your grant.
Nicole told me.

01:16:02.500 --> 01:16:03.540
Oh, thank you.

01:16:03.625 --> 01:16:04.955
He's a genius.

01:16:06.291 --> 01:16:09.081
Well, I told Nicole
I loved your play.

01:16:09.166 --> 01:16:10.876
- Ah. Really.
- Oh, thanks.

01:16:11.250 --> 01:16:13.170
You are one smart cookie.

01:16:14.208 --> 01:16:15.378
Oh, thanks.

01:16:15.458 --> 01:16:17.708
I would just love to...

01:16:17.791 --> 01:16:20.131
crawl inside that brain.

01:16:20.541 --> 01:16:24.831
There was that one moment
when you smell the toast, smell.

01:16:25.833 --> 01:16:28.713
It was literally my favorite thing
that I saw that year.

01:16:28.791 --> 01:16:31.251
- Thanks.
- Truly genius.

01:16:31.333 --> 01:16:32.333
Thank you.

01:16:32.833 --> 01:16:35.083
I was sorry to hear it closed on Broadway.

01:16:35.458 --> 01:16:36.958
They couldn't smell the toast.

01:16:38.333 --> 01:16:39.963
It was so emotional.

01:16:41.250 --> 01:16:43.460
It's very competitive, I imagine.

01:16:44.916 --> 01:16:48.416
Now, when Charlie is in Los Angeles,

01:16:48.500 --> 01:16:51.790
Nicole, of course, agrees
that it will be best for Henry

01:16:52.250 --> 01:16:54.580
that he see each parent equally.

01:16:56.375 --> 01:17:00.165
It's very nice out here, Charlie.
You should give it a chance.

01:17:00.250 --> 01:17:02.710
- Yeah, and the space... you can't beat it.
- Mmm.

01:17:02.791 --> 01:17:03.831
I love it too.

01:17:04.666 --> 01:17:07.956
But all of our personal feelings
about the two cities aside,

01:17:08.041 --> 01:17:12.251
we don't share your assertion
that the couple is an LA-based family.

01:17:12.333 --> 01:17:14.633
It was very clearly their deal

01:17:14.708 --> 01:17:17.998
that they would go back to New York
after Nicole finished her show.

01:17:18.083 --> 01:17:19.633
I'm not aware of any deal.

01:17:20.416 --> 01:17:22.126
Well, I didn't get it in writing.

01:17:25.041 --> 01:17:28.041
Charlie, is this like the deal
that you made

01:17:28.125 --> 01:17:31.575
that you Nicole would spend more time
in LA during your marriage?

01:17:31.666 --> 01:17:34.496
We didn't have a deal.
It was something we discussed.

01:17:34.583 --> 01:17:35.673
But...

01:17:35.750 --> 01:17:38.630
So, it's a deal
when it's something you want

01:17:38.708 --> 01:17:40.828
and a discussion when Nicole wants it?

01:17:44.125 --> 01:17:45.125
Sidebar...

01:17:46.083 --> 01:17:49.003
Nora, do you have a spare office
where Charlie and I can sidebar?

01:17:49.083 --> 01:17:49.923
Sure.

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:51.920
- Can you, um...
- I can show you.

01:17:52.458 --> 01:17:53.458
Come on.

01:17:59.291 --> 01:18:02.211
- Nora is a very good lawyer.
- Uh-huh.

01:18:03.375 --> 01:18:04.705
- Tough, right?
- Yeah.

01:18:05.291 --> 01:18:08.171
And you're in a bind because you've shown
you're willing to fly out here

01:18:08.250 --> 01:18:10.040
and rent an apartment to see your son.

01:18:10.125 --> 01:18:11.825
- You told me to do that.
- I know that.

01:18:11.916 --> 01:18:15.166
And I'm doing that because I want
to see my kid, not to set a precedent.

01:18:15.250 --> 01:18:17.830
Yes, but unfortunately,
you are setting a precedent.

01:18:18.625 --> 01:18:20.245
And a judge might look at it that way.

01:18:20.333 --> 01:18:23.543
What's the alternative? I stay in New York
and never come out here?

01:18:23.625 --> 01:18:25.625
No, because then it would look
to the court

01:18:25.708 --> 01:18:27.578
like you don't care about seeing your son.

01:18:27.666 --> 01:18:30.826
Court or no court? Stop saying "court"
and then "never court."

01:18:30.916 --> 01:18:33.666
Well, the way this is going,
we may have to go to court.

01:18:34.291 --> 01:18:36.961
- Are you aware of how maddening you sound?
- I am.

01:18:38.291 --> 01:18:40.081
And I know it seems unfair.

01:18:43.791 --> 01:18:45.131
But imagine if you were...

01:18:46.166 --> 01:18:49.076
a poor mother whose husband abandons her,

01:18:49.166 --> 01:18:50.916
and then refuses to pay anything.

01:18:52.666 --> 01:18:55.416
That's what the system
is trying to protect people from.

01:18:57.666 --> 01:18:58.666
Listen...

01:18:59.416 --> 01:19:00.786
if I were representing you...

01:19:00.875 --> 01:19:02.035
You are representing me.

01:19:02.125 --> 01:19:03.625
Right, no, of course. No...

01:19:04.416 --> 01:19:08.326
I don't see a judge
moving this child from California.

01:19:08.416 --> 01:19:10.206
I think we try and settle today.

01:19:10.625 --> 01:19:12.575
Settle meaning what?

01:19:13.375 --> 01:19:14.375
She gets LA.

01:19:14.416 --> 01:19:15.826
No, Bert, just...

01:19:16.875 --> 01:19:17.875
No.

01:19:18.125 --> 01:19:19.705
I mean, we have to win this.

01:19:20.083 --> 01:19:22.793
Remember, the win
is what's best for Henry.

01:19:22.875 --> 01:19:25.315
And if you guys go to court,
he's going to get pulled into it.

01:19:25.375 --> 01:19:28.415
But if he stays here
and I stay in New York, that's just...

01:19:28.791 --> 01:19:29.791
then I won't...

01:19:30.541 --> 01:19:32.541
I'll never get to really be
his parent again.

01:19:32.625 --> 01:19:33.455
It'll be different.

01:19:33.541 --> 01:19:34.581
It won't exist.

01:19:35.041 --> 01:19:36.541
So maybe you move here.

01:19:37.166 --> 01:19:38.746
You heard what Aamir said about space.

01:19:38.833 --> 01:19:41.463
Fuck the space, Bert! Fuck the space!

01:19:41.541 --> 01:19:44.921
I'll do whatever you want me to do,
but this is my advice.

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.040
I've seen these things go on and on,

01:19:47.333 --> 01:19:50.173
and the burden of these battles
is immeasurable.

01:19:50.250 --> 01:19:54.290
I had a client get colon cancer and die
before he and his wife came to agreement.

01:19:54.375 --> 01:19:55.825
What about filing in New York?

01:19:55.916 --> 01:19:56.996
It's too late.

01:19:57.333 --> 01:19:59.333
And even if you did,
I don't think it would matter.

01:19:59.375 --> 01:20:01.215
They're being reasonable financially,
you know?

01:20:01.291 --> 01:20:03.921
You're... You're lucky they didn't ask
for half your grant money.

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.809
She wouldn't do that. She knows
I put all that money back in my theater.

01:20:06.833 --> 01:20:08.423
If this continues, she might.

01:20:08.875 --> 01:20:11.125
The actors and crew
all rely on that money.

01:20:11.208 --> 01:20:13.168
The court would never agree
with this, right?

01:20:13.250 --> 01:20:16.170
Whether they do or not,
it'll cost you half your grant money

01:20:16.250 --> 01:20:17.670
to go to court and prove it.

01:20:20.583 --> 01:20:21.753
I feel like a criminal.

01:20:22.708 --> 01:20:24.328
But you didn't commit any crime.

01:20:24.416 --> 01:20:25.746
It doesn't feel that way.

01:20:25.833 --> 01:20:28.083
If we give on LA right now,

01:20:28.333 --> 01:20:30.173
and then try to make
the best deal possible,

01:20:30.250 --> 01:20:32.290
I think we can get her
to give on other fronts.

01:20:32.375 --> 01:20:34.285
There are no other fronts!

01:20:35.250 --> 01:20:36.420
This is the thing!

01:20:37.166 --> 01:20:39.206
He needs to know that I fought for him!

01:20:39.291 --> 01:20:40.291
He'll know.

01:20:54.791 --> 01:20:57.517
I should never have
let her come out here with Henry.

01:20:57.541 --> 01:20:59.921
If it wasn't LA and New York,
it'd be something else.

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:03.420
You'd be fighting about a house,
or a school district, or...

01:21:04.833 --> 01:21:05.963
You know what this is like?

01:21:06.041 --> 01:21:10.041
This is like that joke about the woman
at the hairdresser, she's going to Rome.

01:21:10.125 --> 01:21:11.995
- Do you know this?
- I don't.

01:21:12.083 --> 01:21:14.003
This woman is at her hairdresser
and she says,

01:21:14.083 --> 01:21:15.463
"I'm going to Rome on holiday."

01:21:15.541 --> 01:21:18.041
And he says, "Oh, really?
What... what airline are you taking?"

01:21:18.125 --> 01:21:19.535
She says, "Alitalia."

01:21:19.750 --> 01:21:21.880
He says, "Alitalia? Are you crazy?

01:21:21.958 --> 01:21:24.208
That's the worst...
That's terrible. Don't take that."

01:21:24.291 --> 01:21:25.851
He says, "Where are you going to stay?"

01:21:25.916 --> 01:21:27.676
She says, "I'm going to stay
at the Hassler."

01:21:27.708 --> 01:21:29.788
"The Hassler? What, are you kidding?

01:21:29.875 --> 01:21:32.785
They're renovating the Hassler.
You'll hear hammering all night long.

01:21:32.875 --> 01:21:34.825
You won't sleep.
What are you going to see?"

01:21:34.916 --> 01:21:37.326
She says, "I think I'm going to try
to go to the Vatican."

01:21:37.416 --> 01:21:39.826
"The Vatican?
You'll be standing in line all day long.

01:21:39.916 --> 01:21:41.351
You'll never get to see anything..."

01:21:41.375 --> 01:21:43.575
I'm sorry, Bert,
am I paying for this joke?

01:21:45.791 --> 01:21:48.171
Whatever happens here, it's temporary.

01:21:48.916 --> 01:21:51.916
He's growing up. He's going to have
opinions on the subject.

01:21:52.375 --> 01:21:54.245
Time is on your side, Charlie.

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.170
Maybe he'll do college on the East Coast.

01:22:06.833 --> 01:22:11.173
I have most of my coins,
like my quarters and dimes at Daddy's...

01:22:11.250 --> 01:22:13.210
- Right.
- ...but I'm keeping my dollars

01:22:13.291 --> 01:22:15.421
and my one twenty at yours, okay?

01:22:15.875 --> 01:22:20.075
So, that is one twenty plus 50,
what is that?

01:22:20.416 --> 01:22:21.496
Goddamn it.

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:23.000
What's "Goddamn it"?

01:22:23.083 --> 01:22:24.963
Did you guys lose power where you are?

01:22:25.041 --> 01:22:27.171
Dad? Did we lose power?

01:22:27.666 --> 01:22:28.666
No.

01:22:29.125 --> 01:22:31.995
There's rolling blackouts
in the hills and now...

01:22:32.583 --> 01:22:35.043
Oh, damn it.
Now the gate won't close.

01:22:35.125 --> 01:22:36.625
Her gate won't close.

01:22:42.166 --> 01:22:43.166
Mom!

01:22:43.500 --> 01:22:44.500
Hey.

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.267
- Can we go see my room?
- Yeah, of course.

01:22:49.291 --> 01:22:51.011
- You tried all the...
- I tried everything.

01:22:51.041 --> 01:22:52.751
Sorry I made you come out.

01:22:52.833 --> 01:22:53.673
It's fine.

01:22:53.791 --> 01:22:55.791
- I just...
- You don't want your gate open.

01:22:55.958 --> 01:22:56.958
Right.

01:22:57.208 --> 01:23:00.668
- There should be a panel or something...
- Maybe this is something here.

01:23:02.833 --> 01:23:04.213
- It's a cute house.
- Oh, yeah.

01:23:04.291 --> 01:23:06.001
I mean, from what I can see.

01:23:06.083 --> 01:23:07.083
Thanks.

01:23:10.875 --> 01:23:11.995
You're getting shaggy.

01:23:12.083 --> 01:23:14.673
Yeah, I have to find a hair cutter.

01:23:16.250 --> 01:23:17.380
You want me to cut it?

01:23:18.291 --> 01:23:19.291
Okay.

01:23:30.166 --> 01:23:31.206
Close your eyes.

01:23:36.291 --> 01:23:37.291
He's out.

01:23:37.625 --> 01:23:39.285
Maybe he should stay here tonight.

01:23:40.583 --> 01:23:41.583
It's my night.

01:24:10.625 --> 01:24:13.285
Hey, come on. We're going.
Come on. Let's take a walk. Right?

01:24:13.375 --> 01:24:14.695
Yeah, we're going to take a walk.

01:24:14.750 --> 01:24:16.809
- We're taking a walk.
- Fine, all right. She's crazy.

01:24:16.833 --> 01:24:18.213
We're mostly finished.

01:24:18.833 --> 01:24:21.383
Bert and I hammered out
90 percent of the details,

01:24:21.458 --> 01:24:24.578
and there's a couple minor things hanging,

01:24:24.666 --> 01:24:25.786
but it should be easy.

01:24:26.750 --> 01:24:29.080
And then the judge
makes your divorce official.

01:24:29.958 --> 01:24:31.038
Oh. That's good.

01:24:33.875 --> 01:24:35.825
- Fuck me.
- What?

01:24:35.916 --> 01:24:37.786
Who's that?

01:24:37.875 --> 01:24:40.625
Oh, Charlie shouldn't have done this.

01:24:40.708 --> 01:24:42.288
What do you mean? Where's Bert?

01:24:42.375 --> 01:24:45.995
This means that everything
we've agreed upon now is off the table.

01:24:46.416 --> 01:24:47.496
We've got LA, right?

01:24:47.583 --> 01:24:49.633
Not with Jay Marotta representing him.

01:24:50.208 --> 01:24:51.668
This is a street fight now.

01:24:51.750 --> 01:24:55.290
And I'm going to have to ask for things
that we wouldn't normally ask for.

01:24:55.875 --> 01:24:58.375
This system rewards bad behavior.

01:24:59.833 --> 01:25:01.003
- Jay.
- Hey.

01:25:01.083 --> 01:25:02.083
Hi.

01:25:02.208 --> 01:25:04.418
I saw Miriam at Madeo the other night.

01:25:04.500 --> 01:25:05.960
- Yeah?
- Looking very handsome.

01:25:06.041 --> 01:25:09.041
Oh, you know, you should come
to our Stand Up To Cancer event.

01:25:09.125 --> 01:25:11.365
- Uh, John Legend's going to play.
- Oh, love him.

01:25:11.416 --> 01:25:13.517
Okay? It's going to be
at the Beverly Hilton, I think.

01:25:13.541 --> 01:25:14.601
- Great.
- Okay?

01:25:14.625 --> 01:25:16.385
She said you're spending
more time in Malibu.

01:25:16.416 --> 01:25:17.956
- Oh, really?
- Me too.

01:25:18.041 --> 01:25:20.001
I haven't seen her
since that building was ICM.

01:25:21.041 --> 01:25:22.251
A little history...

01:25:23.833 --> 01:25:26.083
Ten years ago, Charlie takes a risk

01:25:26.166 --> 01:25:30.786
when he first hires Nicole as an actress
in his play in New York City.

01:25:31.500 --> 01:25:34.040
He's a well-regarded
up-and-coming director

01:25:34.125 --> 01:25:35.575
of the avant-garde.

01:25:35.875 --> 01:25:39.075
And she's known
as the girl in that college sex movie

01:25:39.166 --> 01:25:41.166
who takes her top off.

01:25:41.333 --> 01:25:43.434
- My client will not be slut-shamed...
- Ten years on...

01:25:43.458 --> 01:25:44.628
...for an artistic choice.

01:25:44.708 --> 01:25:47.078
...and many prestigious
theater roles later...

01:25:47.583 --> 01:25:50.173
she becomes an actress
of great credibility.

01:25:50.250 --> 01:25:52.500
And it's because of that credibility,

01:25:52.791 --> 01:25:56.631
that she's offered the lead role
in a major television show.

01:25:56.708 --> 01:26:00.128
This new opportunity is thanks to Charlie.

01:26:00.208 --> 01:26:04.168
Your Honor, we shouldn't have to pay
support money at this point.

01:26:05.083 --> 01:26:08.833
In fact, Charlie is entitled
to half her TV money,

01:26:09.375 --> 01:26:11.915
present and future earnings of the show.

01:26:14.500 --> 01:26:18.540
Charlie's just received
the enormous sum of $650,000

01:26:18.625 --> 01:26:20.075
in the form of a MacArthur grant.

01:26:20.166 --> 01:26:22.226
- Of which he gets...
- This is for the theater work...

01:26:22.250 --> 01:26:24.920
- ...he conducted during the marriage.
- ...in 125,000 installments

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:26.250
...over five years.

01:26:26.333 --> 01:26:28.767
- So by Jay's same logic, this is work...
- He uses the money...

01:26:28.791 --> 01:26:31.476
- ...that Nicole contributed to.
- to employ actors and crew members...

01:26:31.500 --> 01:26:34.059
- One at a time, please.
- ...and to pay debts that he's accumulated

01:26:34.083 --> 01:26:36.963
with his theater company
that stars his wife.

01:26:39.791 --> 01:26:42.081
- Bless you.
- Not only did she turn down

01:26:42.166 --> 01:26:44.126
a lucrative and successful career
in movies

01:26:44.208 --> 01:26:46.498
to perform in his little theater,

01:26:47.083 --> 01:26:51.083
but she actually supplied Charlie
with a loan early on to help out.

01:26:51.166 --> 01:26:53.666
- Which he paid back.
- She lent her name to the marquee,

01:26:53.750 --> 01:26:56.017
which was the principle reason
people came to the theater.

01:26:56.041 --> 01:26:57.791
That may have been true ten years ago.

01:26:57.875 --> 01:27:02.035
And in turn,
she helped establish Charlie's reputation.

01:27:02.541 --> 01:27:04.081
Now, over the next ten years,

01:27:04.166 --> 01:27:07.246
she was subsequently offered parts
in movies, TV shows,

01:27:07.375 --> 01:27:09.705
most of which she turned down
at Charlie's behest

01:27:09.791 --> 01:27:12.461
to be a mom and act in his plays.

01:27:13.041 --> 01:27:17.041
So, while we are willing to be flexible
on support,

01:27:17.125 --> 01:27:20.825
we contend that half of Charlie's
grant money be split between the parties.

01:27:20.916 --> 01:27:23.376
I don't see how you can claim
that she gets half a grant

01:27:23.458 --> 01:27:25.418
dedicated to his genius.

01:27:25.500 --> 01:27:27.059
He became a genius during the marriage.

01:27:27.083 --> 01:27:28.003
Oh, come on, Nora.

01:27:28.083 --> 01:27:30.833
Charlie himself, upon hearing
that he received the prize,

01:27:30.916 --> 01:27:33.206
told Nicole that it belonged to her too.

01:27:33.583 --> 01:27:35.713
That's what people say
when they win awards.

01:27:35.791 --> 01:27:38.751
Mmm. No, he was implying what was true.

01:27:39.458 --> 01:27:42.918
His genius was an intangible asset
built during the marriage.

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:46.040
Nora, I like how you refer
to Charlie's theater

01:27:46.125 --> 01:27:48.705
as a ramshackle downtown dump

01:27:48.791 --> 01:27:50.291
when you're arguing custody,

01:27:50.375 --> 01:27:52.325
but when you want more money,

01:27:52.583 --> 01:27:55.083
he's a big, rich, genius
Broadway director.

01:27:55.166 --> 01:27:56.456
You can't have it both ways.

01:27:56.541 --> 01:27:57.541
Oh, really? Why not?

01:27:58.041 --> 01:28:00.251
And whether you think
it's fair or not, Jay,

01:28:00.958 --> 01:28:03.378
the first monetary installment
from the MacArthur grant

01:28:03.458 --> 01:28:06.267
was put into a joint marital account,
and thus became communal property.

01:28:06.291 --> 01:28:08.921
Fuck. You shouldn't have put
that money in a joint account.

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:12.059
There's not going to be anything left,
anyway. I'm using it all to divorce her.

01:28:12.083 --> 01:28:14.673
Nora, I have to say
that your account of this marriage

01:28:14.750 --> 01:28:17.330
takes place in an alternate reality.

01:28:17.916 --> 01:28:23.376
By suddenly moving to LA
and insisting on an LA residence,

01:28:23.458 --> 01:28:25.578
Nicole is withholding Henry...

01:28:25.666 --> 01:28:28.476
- Counsel, please be seated.
- ...alienating him from his father,

01:28:28.500 --> 01:28:31.460
which has turned Charlie's world
upside down.

01:28:31.541 --> 01:28:33.309
- Counselor?
- It amounts to an ambush.

01:28:33.333 --> 01:28:35.503
"Witholding," Jay? Really? "Alienating"?

01:28:35.916 --> 01:28:37.206
Well, those are fighting words,

01:28:37.291 --> 01:28:40.331
and it's simply false and does nothing
to further this settlement.

01:28:41.500 --> 01:28:44.380
Your recap of this situation
is outrageous.

01:28:44.458 --> 01:28:47.458
And although California is,
without doubt, a no-fault state,

01:28:47.541 --> 01:28:50.711
it bears mentioning
in the accurate recap of this situation

01:28:50.791 --> 01:28:52.711
that Charlie had had extramarital affairs.

01:28:52.791 --> 01:28:55.381
- An extramarital affair.
- Do you really want me to go there?

01:28:55.458 --> 01:28:57.418
- Yeah, let's go there.
- Okay.

01:28:57.583 --> 01:29:00.583
Nicole has admitted
to hacking Charlie's computer

01:29:00.666 --> 01:29:02.076
and reading his emails,

01:29:02.166 --> 01:29:04.576
which, if proven, is a felony.

01:29:04.916 --> 01:29:06.706
And, Nora,
I don't think you'd be too happy

01:29:06.791 --> 01:29:10.171
if I ask Nicole about her alcohol
consumption in the evenings.

01:29:10.250 --> 01:29:11.080
What?

01:29:11.166 --> 01:29:13.746
She confided in Charlie
one night recently,

01:29:13.833 --> 01:29:16.213
having just carried Henry to bed,

01:29:16.291 --> 01:29:20.631
that she was having trouble standing
while walking down the staircase.

01:29:21.291 --> 01:29:24.251
And from what I understand,
this is not an isolated event.

01:29:24.333 --> 01:29:26.503
So you let me know, Nora,

01:29:26.583 --> 01:29:28.923
- and we will go there as needed.
- Charlie?

01:29:29.958 --> 01:29:30.958
Can I ask you,

01:29:31.041 --> 01:29:33.041
how do you expect
to have more time with Henry

01:29:33.125 --> 01:29:35.575
when you don't exercise the time
you already have,

01:29:35.666 --> 01:29:37.956
and exercise it responsibly?

01:29:38.500 --> 01:29:41.210
On a recent visit to Los Angeles,

01:29:41.291 --> 01:29:43.921
after failing to call, text,

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:46.210
communicate in any way, shape, or form,

01:29:46.458 --> 01:29:47.978
Charlie finally arrived two hours late

01:29:48.041 --> 01:29:49.961
to pick up Henry
at Nicole's mother's house.

01:29:50.041 --> 01:29:51.961
At that point, the car seat,

01:29:52.041 --> 01:29:55.791
which he had assured Nicole
had been professionally installed,

01:29:55.875 --> 01:29:57.285
was clearly not even belted in.

01:29:57.375 --> 01:30:00.309
- It was just sitting in the back seat.
- You have to buckle in the car seat.

01:30:00.333 --> 01:30:01.213
- It's the law.
- I know.

01:30:01.291 --> 01:30:03.892
- I thought the rental place did it.
- They can't. It's a liability.

01:30:03.916 --> 01:30:06.017
I know that now.
Once we discovered that, we fixed it.

01:30:06.041 --> 01:30:07.041
Counsel?

01:30:07.958 --> 01:30:09.498
You can see my courtroom is full

01:30:09.583 --> 01:30:13.133
and there are people who don't have
the resources your clients have,

01:30:13.541 --> 01:30:16.751
and I'm fairly certain
you haven't exhausted, in good faith,

01:30:16.833 --> 01:30:19.133
the arguments in the case of this child.

01:30:19.208 --> 01:30:21.748
In the meantime,
we'll keep the status quo.

01:30:21.833 --> 01:30:25.423
This remains an LA family
for the time being.

01:30:25.708 --> 01:30:27.998
I took over this department recently,

01:30:28.583 --> 01:30:31.213
and I'm still becoming acquainted
with the cases.

01:30:31.291 --> 01:30:35.291
So, I'm going to appoint
an expert evaluator

01:30:35.750 --> 01:30:38.710
who knows much more about young children
than I do.

01:30:39.375 --> 01:30:41.495
Once the evaluation is done,

01:30:41.708 --> 01:30:44.458
we'll modify the orders where necessary.

01:30:49.541 --> 01:30:50.581
Hey.

01:30:51.250 --> 01:30:52.380
Hey, where's Henry?

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:55.130
He's with Cassie and her kids
at laser tag.

01:30:56.250 --> 01:30:57.370
You want something to drink?

01:30:57.416 --> 01:31:01.076
I have unfiltered tap water, beer,
and some juice boxes.

01:31:01.416 --> 01:31:02.536
I'll take a juice box.

01:31:08.708 --> 01:31:10.708
You don't have anything on the walls?

01:31:10.791 --> 01:31:13.911
I don't have anything to put on them
except Henry's art, which is being framed.

01:31:13.958 --> 01:31:17.708
I can give you some stuff,
you know, until you get some things.

01:31:18.250 --> 01:31:21.460
How about that great picture of Henry
on the Staten Island Ferry?

01:31:21.625 --> 01:31:22.785
Aren't you in that one?

01:31:24.291 --> 01:31:25.631
I guess I... You could...

01:31:25.708 --> 01:31:27.309
- cut me out.
- I have to leave a day early

01:31:27.333 --> 01:31:28.543
to New York on the 22nd.

01:31:28.625 --> 01:31:30.705
So I was wondering
if I could take Henry that Friday.

01:31:30.750 --> 01:31:33.830
Uh, the 22nd. So, that's the 21st?

01:31:34.416 --> 01:31:36.326
Mmm, we have plans, actually.

01:31:36.416 --> 01:31:39.456
We're going to, um, some thing at LACMA
with the cousins.

01:31:40.041 --> 01:31:42.131
But could you change it
so I could take him?

01:31:42.208 --> 01:31:43.878
Mmm. It's just one night.

01:31:43.958 --> 01:31:45.498
- He's looking forward to it.
- Really?

01:31:46.250 --> 01:31:48.330
It's my night, Charlie, we negotiated it.

01:31:48.625 --> 01:31:49.625
Okay, fine.

01:31:50.708 --> 01:31:51.708
But what?

01:31:51.750 --> 01:31:53.710
No, I'm just asking you to be flexible.

01:31:53.791 --> 01:31:56.631
I am flexible. You come in and out
and I adjust based on your schedule.

01:31:56.708 --> 01:31:59.868
- This one night we have tickets to...
- It's not only this one night, but fine.

01:32:00.125 --> 01:32:03.325
- Henry's teacher wants to meet with us.
- You mean his LA teacher?

01:32:03.416 --> 01:32:06.376
Can you, uh, answer the email
so we could set a time?

01:32:06.750 --> 01:32:08.210
Yeah, I've been distracted.

01:32:09.333 --> 01:32:10.463
I understand.

01:32:10.875 --> 01:32:13.475
They just want to rule out everything,
you know, with his reading.

01:32:13.500 --> 01:32:15.500
I just think
he's a little over-anxious.

01:32:15.583 --> 01:32:17.003
I think he wants it too much.

01:32:17.083 --> 01:32:19.003
They said he's off the charts in math.

01:32:19.083 --> 01:32:21.476
He quits too easily
when things aren't easy for him.

01:32:21.500 --> 01:32:23.170
You know, he's like us, he's stubborn.

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:27.250
He's still a lousy Monopoly player
because he tries to save all his money.

01:32:32.708 --> 01:32:33.708
So...

01:32:34.833 --> 01:32:37.463
- I thought we should talk.
- Mm-hmm.

01:32:37.541 --> 01:32:39.581
I feel like maybe things
have gone too far.

01:32:39.625 --> 01:32:40.455
Uh-huh.

01:32:40.541 --> 01:32:43.791
I mean, my mom's taking out a loan
against the house to help me pay Nora.

01:32:43.875 --> 01:32:45.165
I thought I paid Nora.

01:32:45.250 --> 01:32:46.960
You pay 30 percent of Nora.

01:32:47.041 --> 01:32:49.541
Well, I'm going broke too,
if that's any help.

01:32:49.791 --> 01:32:51.791
I've just agreed to direct
two shitty plays,

01:32:51.875 --> 01:32:54.235
and we can forget putting anything away
for Henry's college.

01:32:54.750 --> 01:32:58.040
It's just that up until now, we've been
able to keep Henry somewhat removed,

01:32:58.125 --> 01:32:59.455
and this will change that.

01:32:59.625 --> 01:33:00.625
Mm-hmm.

01:33:00.916 --> 01:33:01.916
We have to protect him.

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:02.830
I agree.

01:33:02.916 --> 01:33:06.166
Nora says that the evaluator
will come into our homes,

01:33:06.458 --> 01:33:08.958
they're going to interview Henry
in addition to us,

01:33:09.041 --> 01:33:12.131
our friends, family, enemies,

01:33:12.208 --> 01:33:15.498
and then they'll observe us with him,
how we are as parents.

01:33:15.583 --> 01:33:17.173
- Sounds awful.
- I know.

01:33:17.583 --> 01:33:21.423
I feel like if anybody observed me on any
given day as a mom, I'd never get custody.

01:33:23.583 --> 01:33:24.583
That was a joke.

01:33:25.041 --> 01:33:27.291
- I know. I feel the same way.
- Right.

01:33:27.375 --> 01:33:28.375
So...

01:33:29.666 --> 01:33:31.916
Maybe we can figure
something out between us.

01:33:32.375 --> 01:33:34.455
You remember I said this to you
at the beginning?

01:33:34.541 --> 01:33:36.831
I know you did,
but these are different circumstances.

01:33:36.916 --> 01:33:38.746
I was anticipating these circumstances.

01:33:39.583 --> 01:33:41.543
Anyway, shall we try this?

01:33:41.625 --> 01:33:42.625
Okay.

01:33:57.125 --> 01:33:58.165
I don't know how to start.

01:34:00.666 --> 01:34:03.036
Do you understand
why I want to stay in LA?

01:34:03.125 --> 01:34:03.955
No.

01:34:04.041 --> 01:34:05.421
Well... That's not...

01:34:05.500 --> 01:34:08.080
Charlie, that's not a useful way
for us to start.

01:34:08.166 --> 01:34:09.286
I don't understand it.

01:34:11.208 --> 01:34:13.998
You don't remember promising
that we could do time here?

01:34:14.083 --> 01:34:15.083
We discussed things.

01:34:15.541 --> 01:34:17.001
We were married, we said things.

01:34:17.083 --> 01:34:18.753
We talked about moving to Europe.

01:34:18.833 --> 01:34:20.043
About getting a...

01:34:21.125 --> 01:34:23.245
sideboard, or what do you call it?

01:34:23.333 --> 01:34:25.963
A credenza, to fill the empty space
behind the couch.

01:34:26.041 --> 01:34:27.171
We never did any of it.

01:34:27.250 --> 01:34:28.960
You turned down the residency
at the Geffen

01:34:29.041 --> 01:34:31.211
that would've brought us here
for a... a year.

01:34:31.291 --> 01:34:32.541
It wasn't something I wanted.

01:34:32.625 --> 01:34:35.455
We had a great theater company
and a great life where we were.

01:34:35.541 --> 01:34:38.081
- You call that a great life?
- You know what I mean.

01:34:38.166 --> 01:34:40.876
I don't mean we had a great marriage.
I mean, life in Brooklyn.

01:34:41.750 --> 01:34:42.750
Professionally.

01:34:43.166 --> 01:34:45.706
I don't know. Honestly, I never considered
anything different.

01:34:45.791 --> 01:34:47.421
Well, that's the problem, isn't it?

01:34:47.500 --> 01:34:50.580
I mean, I was your wife.
You should've considered my happiness too.

01:34:50.666 --> 01:34:54.286
Come on, you were happy.
You've just decided you weren't now.

01:34:55.583 --> 01:34:57.883
Okay. Okay.

01:34:57.958 --> 01:34:59.038
Let's...

01:34:59.500 --> 01:35:02.250
M-My work is here now, my family is here.

01:35:02.333 --> 01:35:05.226
And I agreed to put Henry in school here
because your show went to series.

01:35:05.250 --> 01:35:08.351
I did that knowing that when you were done
shooting, he'd come back to New York.

01:35:08.375 --> 01:35:09.415
Honey, we never said that.

01:35:09.458 --> 01:35:12.142
That may have been your assumption,
but we never expressly said that.

01:35:12.166 --> 01:35:14.746
- We did say it.
- When did we say it?

01:35:14.833 --> 01:35:16.713
I don't know when we said it,
but we said it.

01:35:16.791 --> 01:35:18.684
- I thought...
- We said it that time on the phone!

01:35:18.708 --> 01:35:20.248
Honey, let me finish. Sorry.

01:35:20.333 --> 01:35:21.633
I keep saying that.

01:35:21.708 --> 01:35:24.578
I thought that if Henry was happy here,

01:35:24.666 --> 01:35:27.496
and my show continued,
that we might do LA for a while.

01:35:27.583 --> 01:35:29.793
I was not privy to that thought process.

01:35:29.875 --> 01:35:31.595
The only reason
we didn't live here

01:35:31.625 --> 01:35:33.285
is because you can't imagine desires

01:35:33.375 --> 01:35:35.825
other than your own,
unless they're forced on you.

01:35:35.916 --> 01:35:38.836
Okay, you wish you hadn't married me,
you wish you'd had a different life,

01:35:38.916 --> 01:35:40.246
but this is what happened.

01:35:41.416 --> 01:35:42.876
- So, what do we do?
- I don't know.

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:46.920
Nora says
there's no coming back from this.

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:50.540
Fuck Nora! I hate fucking Nora
telling me I always lived in LA

01:35:50.625 --> 01:35:52.325
even though I never lived in LA.

01:35:53.291 --> 01:35:55.251
How could you have her
say those things about me?

01:35:55.333 --> 01:35:57.003
Jay said them about me too.

01:35:57.541 --> 01:35:58.961
You shouldn't have fired Bert.

01:35:59.041 --> 01:36:00.251
I needed my own asshole.

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:05.920
Let's just both agree both of our lawyers
said shitty stuff about both of us.

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:07.130
Nora was worse.

01:36:07.500 --> 01:36:08.790
Jay called me an alcoholic.

01:36:08.875 --> 01:36:11.684
You pulled the rug out from under me
and you're putting me through hell.

01:36:11.708 --> 01:36:13.428
You put me through hell
during our marriage.

01:36:13.500 --> 01:36:14.780
Oh, is that what that was, hell?

01:36:14.833 --> 01:36:17.226
And now you're going to put Henry
through this horrible thing

01:36:17.250 --> 01:36:19.726
- so you can yet again get what you want!
- It's not what I want.

01:36:19.750 --> 01:36:22.000
I mean, it's what I want,
but it's what was...

01:36:22.375 --> 01:36:23.375
was...

01:36:23.708 --> 01:36:24.878
what's best for him.

01:36:24.958 --> 01:36:28.418
Oh, well, I was wondering when you'd
get around to Henry and what he wants.

01:36:28.500 --> 01:36:29.420
Fuck off!

01:36:29.500 --> 01:36:32.920
No, you fuck off!
If you'd listen to your son, or anyone,

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:34.800
then he'd tell you
that he'd rather live here!

01:36:34.833 --> 01:36:36.673
Stop putting your feelings about me
onto Henry.

01:36:36.708 --> 01:36:38.208
He tells me he likes it better here.

01:36:38.291 --> 01:36:40.517
He tells you because he knows
it's what you want to hear!

01:36:40.541 --> 01:36:43.267
He tells me you're on the phone all
the time. You don't play with him.

01:36:43.291 --> 01:36:46.476
Because I'm going through a divorce in LA
and trying to direct a play in New York!

01:36:46.500 --> 01:36:49.540
Which closed because I wasn't there.
It was a huge opportunity for me...

01:36:49.625 --> 01:36:51.585
You're fighting for something
you don't even want!

01:36:51.625 --> 01:36:53.059
And I let everyone down.

01:36:53.083 --> 01:36:55.133
You're being so much like your father.

01:36:55.625 --> 01:36:57.035
Do not compare me to my father!

01:36:57.125 --> 01:36:59.535
I didn't compare you to him.
I said you were acting like him.

01:36:59.625 --> 01:37:00.905
You're exactly like your mother.

01:37:00.958 --> 01:37:04.142
Everything you were complaining about her,
you're doing. You're suffocating Henry.

01:37:04.166 --> 01:37:06.876
First of all, I love my mother.
She was a wonderful mother.

01:37:06.958 --> 01:37:09.351
- I'm just repeating what you told me.
- Secondly, how dare you

01:37:09.375 --> 01:37:11.205
compare my mothering to my mother!

01:37:11.291 --> 01:37:14.251
I may be like my father,
but I am not like my mother!

01:37:14.333 --> 01:37:15.333
You are!

01:37:15.416 --> 01:37:16.956
And you're like my father!

01:37:17.041 --> 01:37:18.461
You're also like my mother!

01:37:18.541 --> 01:37:20.751
You're all the bad things
about all of these people!

01:37:21.250 --> 01:37:22.330
But mostly your mother.

01:37:22.416 --> 01:37:23.776
When we would lie in bed together,

01:37:23.833 --> 01:37:26.673
sometimes I would look at you and see her
and just feel so gross!

01:37:26.750 --> 01:37:29.460
- I felt repulsed when you touched me!
- You're a slob.

01:37:29.541 --> 01:37:31.221
I made all the beds,
closed all cabinets...

01:37:31.250 --> 01:37:34.540
The thought of having sex with you
makes me want to peel my skin off.

01:37:34.625 --> 01:37:36.955
You'll never be happy, in LA or anywhere.

01:37:37.041 --> 01:37:39.541
You'll think you found
some better opposite guy than me,

01:37:39.625 --> 01:37:41.995
and in a few years,
you'll rebel against him

01:37:42.083 --> 01:37:45.213
because you need to have your voice,
but you don't want a voice.

01:37:45.291 --> 01:37:47.611
You just want to fucking complain
about not having a voice!

01:37:47.666 --> 01:37:50.916
I think about being married to you,
and that woman is a stranger to me.

01:37:51.458 --> 01:37:53.918
- I mean, we had a child's marriage.
- You've regressed.

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:56.630
You've gone back to your life
before you met me, it's pathetic.

01:37:56.708 --> 01:38:00.578
People used to tell me that you were
too selfish to be a great artist.

01:38:00.666 --> 01:38:02.376
And I used to defend you.

01:38:02.458 --> 01:38:03.828
They were absolutely right.

01:38:03.916 --> 01:38:06.626
All your best acting is behind you.
You're back to being a hack!

01:38:06.708 --> 01:38:09.878
You gaslighted me!
You're a fucking villain!

01:38:09.958 --> 01:38:13.418
You want to present yourself as a victim
because it's a good legal strategy?

01:38:13.500 --> 01:38:16.580
Fine, but you and I both know
you chose this life!

01:38:17.125 --> 01:38:18.995
You wanted it until you didn't!

01:38:20.041 --> 01:38:22.291
You used me so you could get out of LA.

01:38:22.375 --> 01:38:23.415
I didn't use you.

01:38:23.500 --> 01:38:25.830
You did, and then you blamed me for it!

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:28.420
You always made me aware
of what I was doing wrong,

01:38:28.500 --> 01:38:29.790
how I was falling short!

01:38:29.875 --> 01:38:31.575
Life with you was joyless!

01:38:31.666 --> 01:38:34.206
What, so then you had to go
and fuck someone else?

01:38:34.291 --> 01:38:35.931
You shouldn't be upset that I fucked her!

01:38:35.958 --> 01:38:37.838
You should be upset
that I had a laugh with her!

01:38:37.916 --> 01:38:38.746
Do you love her?

01:38:38.833 --> 01:38:40.083
No.

01:38:40.166 --> 01:38:42.626
But she didn't hate me. You hated me.

01:38:42.708 --> 01:38:43.788
You hated me.

01:38:43.875 --> 01:38:45.575
You fucked somebody we worked with.

01:38:45.666 --> 01:38:48.166
You stopped having sex with me
in the last year.

01:38:48.250 --> 01:38:49.750
I never cheated on you.

01:38:49.833 --> 01:38:50.923
That was cheating on me!

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:52.960
But there was so much I could have done.

01:38:53.041 --> 01:38:55.671
I was a director in my twenties
who came from nothing

01:38:55.750 --> 01:38:58.920
and was suddenly on the cover
of fucking Time Out New York!

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:01.960
I was hot shit and I wanted
to fuck everybody and I didn't.

01:39:02.041 --> 01:39:04.291
And I loved you
and I didn't want to lose you.

01:39:04.375 --> 01:39:07.205
But I'm in my twenties,
and I didn't want to lose that too,

01:39:07.291 --> 01:39:08.831
and I kinda did!

01:39:09.291 --> 01:39:11.671
And you wanted so much so fast.

01:39:11.750 --> 01:39:13.460
I didn't even want to get married.

01:39:13.541 --> 01:39:15.131
And fuck it!

01:39:15.458 --> 01:39:17.168
There's so much I didn't do.

01:39:17.250 --> 01:39:19.920
- Thanks for that!
- You're welcome!

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:23.170
I can't believe
I have to know you forever!

01:39:23.250 --> 01:39:25.330
You're fucking insane!

01:39:26.125 --> 01:39:28.325
And you're fucking winning!

01:39:28.958 --> 01:39:30.538
Are you kidding me?

01:39:30.916 --> 01:39:32.746
I wanted to be married.

01:39:33.291 --> 01:39:34.631
I'd already lost!

01:39:35.083 --> 01:39:37.423
You didn't love me as much as I loved you!

01:39:39.291 --> 01:39:40.961
What does that have to do with LA?

01:39:43.291 --> 01:39:44.131
What?

01:39:44.208 --> 01:39:47.628
You're so merged
with your own selfishness,

01:39:47.708 --> 01:39:50.828
you don't even identify it
as selfishness anymore!

01:39:51.208 --> 01:39:53.458
You're such a dick!

01:39:53.541 --> 01:39:56.171
Every day I wake up
and I hope you're dead!

01:39:56.250 --> 01:39:59.290
Dead, like if I could guarantee
Henry would be okay,

01:39:59.375 --> 01:40:03.205
I'd hope you'd get an illness,
and then get hit by a car and die!

01:40:22.958 --> 01:40:24.998
Oh, God!

01:40:34.958 --> 01:40:35.958
I'm sorry.

01:40:37.708 --> 01:40:38.708
Me too.

01:41:04.583 --> 01:41:06.883
Okay. No, we can make this nice.

01:41:07.250 --> 01:41:10.630
Um, I would take the smaller plants
and put them by the window.

01:41:11.333 --> 01:41:13.923
And, uh, do you have things
we can put on the walls?

01:41:33.541 --> 01:41:35.631
All right, that's it.
Thank you very much.

01:41:35.708 --> 01:41:38.078
We miss you,
and it looks great, really.

01:41:38.166 --> 01:41:39.851
- Let us know how it goes, okay?
- All right.

01:41:39.875 --> 01:41:41.955
I'll see you guys on, uh... on Monday.

01:41:42.291 --> 01:41:44.921
- Love you.
- All right, love you too. Bye.

01:42:09.375 --> 01:42:11.285
Why do we have so many plants
all of a sudden?

01:42:11.375 --> 01:42:14.059
We'll have to return some of this stuff,
so don't get too used to it.

01:42:14.083 --> 01:42:16.043
I find plants kind of scary.

01:42:16.375 --> 01:42:17.745
These plants are good guys.

01:42:18.750 --> 01:42:20.330
Hey, come here.

01:42:22.916 --> 01:42:23.916
Yeah?

01:42:25.583 --> 01:42:28.753
Tomorrow, this woman is going to come
and visit us...

01:42:29.750 --> 01:42:32.290
and be with us while we eat dinner.

01:42:32.375 --> 01:42:34.285
- Is it your girlfriend?
- No, no.

01:42:34.708 --> 01:42:37.418
- Is it Mommy's boyfriend?
- No. Why? Does Mommy have a boyfriend?

01:42:37.500 --> 01:42:39.580
I don't know. Does she?

01:42:39.666 --> 01:42:42.076
- I don't know.
- I don't know.

01:42:43.500 --> 01:42:45.130
Why is someone watching us eat dinner?

01:42:45.208 --> 01:42:46.578
I know, it's weird.

01:42:47.375 --> 01:42:49.075
It's just something we have to do.

01:42:49.500 --> 01:42:51.000
Which has to do with...

01:42:51.541 --> 01:42:53.791
Mommy and me figuring out everything...

01:42:54.750 --> 01:42:56.080
and how we're going to be.

01:42:57.041 --> 01:42:58.041
Um...

01:42:58.791 --> 01:42:59.791
You know?

01:43:00.958 --> 01:43:02.128
Will you read to me?

01:43:03.291 --> 01:43:04.461
Sure. Grab your book.

01:43:05.625 --> 01:43:07.455
Do you use drugs or alcohol?

01:43:07.875 --> 01:43:08.875
I drink alcohol.

01:43:09.500 --> 01:43:11.250
How much alcohol do you drink?

01:43:12.666 --> 01:43:13.666
Hmm...

01:43:13.708 --> 01:43:15.828
I don't know, a glass of wine with dinner.

01:43:16.083 --> 01:43:18.043
- Sometimes more.
- How much more?

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:21.630
It's... Sometimes a...

01:43:21.958 --> 01:43:23.038
a few...

01:43:23.791 --> 01:43:27.211
I... sometimes split a bottle of wine
with someone.

01:43:27.291 --> 01:43:29.351
- Okay, who do you split it with?
- I mean...

01:43:29.375 --> 01:43:32.955
if I'm having dinner with someone
and we order a bottle of wine.

01:43:33.041 --> 01:43:35.331
- Okay.
- You know, like at a restaurant.

01:43:35.416 --> 01:43:39.246
When you say, "Do you want to go
by the glass or do we get a bottle?"

01:43:40.166 --> 01:43:42.876
- You get a bottle?
- Well, sometimes.

01:43:44.333 --> 01:43:46.543
I mean, sometimes I go by the glass.

01:43:47.250 --> 01:43:48.380
You know, it depends.

01:43:52.875 --> 01:43:56.035
Did you mean drugs ever?
I have done drugs.

01:43:57.375 --> 01:43:58.375
In college.

01:43:59.375 --> 01:44:02.205
- Anything since you've been...
- I... I don't do it regularly.

01:44:02.291 --> 01:44:04.011
Anything since you've been
a mother?

01:44:06.375 --> 01:44:07.665
Pot a few times.

01:44:08.708 --> 01:44:11.628
Coke once at a party.
I mean, Henry wasn't with me.

01:44:14.208 --> 01:44:17.168
What would you say
are your strengths as a parent?

01:44:19.458 --> 01:44:20.458
Uh...

01:44:25.291 --> 01:44:26.291
I listen.

01:44:27.583 --> 01:44:28.583
I play.

01:44:30.958 --> 01:44:33.538
I-I put in the time. I...

01:44:34.250 --> 01:44:35.250
love...

01:44:36.166 --> 01:44:37.746
taking care of him...

01:44:38.500 --> 01:44:40.080
watching him grow.

01:44:42.166 --> 01:44:43.166
And sometimes...

01:44:43.708 --> 01:44:47.458
what they say about "it goes so fast"
is true, but...

01:44:48.916 --> 01:44:49.956
sometimes it's not.

01:44:50.458 --> 01:44:53.128
Sometimes it goes too slow, honestly.

01:44:54.500 --> 01:44:56.170
What are your weaknesses?

01:44:59.083 --> 01:45:01.753
I'm too precise. I care too much.

01:45:02.500 --> 01:45:04.420
Are those weaknesses?

01:45:06.458 --> 01:45:07.458
Maybe not.

01:45:10.583 --> 01:45:13.213
You know, he can be an asshole and...

01:45:13.958 --> 01:45:16.601
I can get really pissed off,
and I'll call him on being an asshole...

01:45:16.625 --> 01:45:18.025
I'm going to stop you there.

01:45:18.458 --> 01:45:20.578
When you do this for real,
don't ever say that.

01:45:20.666 --> 01:45:22.826
People don't accept mothers
who drink too much wine

01:45:22.916 --> 01:45:24.916
and yell at their child
and call him an asshole.

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:26.500
I get it. I do it too.

01:45:27.208 --> 01:45:29.288
We can accept an imperfect dad.

01:45:29.375 --> 01:45:33.665
Let's face it, the idea of a good father
was only invented like 30 years ago.

01:45:34.208 --> 01:45:37.208
Before that,
fathers were expected to be silent

01:45:37.291 --> 01:45:41.001
and absent and unreliable and selfish,

01:45:41.125 --> 01:45:43.325
and can all say
we want them to be different.

01:45:43.708 --> 01:45:46.788
But on some basic level,
we accept them.

01:45:47.083 --> 01:45:49.133
We love them for their fallibilities,

01:45:49.208 --> 01:45:53.038
but people absolutely don't accept
those same failings in mothers.

01:45:53.125 --> 01:45:56.165
We don't accept it structurally
and we don't accept it spiritually.

01:45:56.250 --> 01:45:59.920
Because the basis
of our Judeo-Christian whatever

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:03.460
is Mary, Mother of Jesus,
and she's perfect.

01:46:03.708 --> 01:46:06.458
She's a virgin who gives birth,

01:46:06.916 --> 01:46:11.456
unwaveringly supports her child
and holds his dead body when he's gone.

01:46:12.041 --> 01:46:14.751
And the dad isn't there.
He didn't even do the fucking.

01:46:15.083 --> 01:46:16.213
God is in heaven.

01:46:17.208 --> 01:46:21.248
God is the father
and God didn't show up.

01:46:21.541 --> 01:46:25.501
So, you have to be perfect, and Charlie
can be a fuck up and it doesn't matter.

01:46:26.625 --> 01:46:29.915
You will always be held
to a different, higher standard.

01:46:30.333 --> 01:46:33.503
And it's fucked up,
but that's the way it is.

01:46:42.791 --> 01:46:44.881
Ooh! Whoosh!

01:46:45.208 --> 01:46:46.208
Oh.

01:47:00.458 --> 01:47:03.958
Oh. I think I rang the wrong bell.
Nancy Katz.

01:47:04.041 --> 01:47:05.331
Hi, I'm Charlie Barber.

01:47:05.958 --> 01:47:07.628
Henry's just playing in his room.

01:47:09.125 --> 01:47:10.495
Nancy, can I get you anything?

01:47:10.583 --> 01:47:13.583
Um, I'm easy. A glass of water?

01:47:22.375 --> 01:47:24.075
It's a new apartment.

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:32.000
Shall we go in here?

01:47:32.291 --> 01:47:33.291
Sure.

01:47:40.125 --> 01:47:41.125
Um...

01:47:50.458 --> 01:47:53.378
Um, what's a day like
for the two of you here?

01:47:53.916 --> 01:47:56.206
Well, if he has school,
I take him there, of course,

01:47:56.291 --> 01:47:58.331
and pick him up, assuming I can do both.

01:47:58.583 --> 01:48:00.713
What prevents you from picking him up?

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:02.000
Um...

01:48:02.458 --> 01:48:05.788
You know, work. I'm preparing a play
I'm directing in a few months.

01:48:06.083 --> 01:48:07.253
Oh, what is that?

01:48:07.666 --> 01:48:10.576
Kasimir and Karoline by Ödön von Horváth.

01:48:10.666 --> 01:48:12.536
We’re doing it at the Barrow in New York.

01:48:12.625 --> 01:48:14.125
So, you have to be away?

01:48:14.208 --> 01:48:17.328
Yes, recently, since Nicole's
been working on the show in LA,

01:48:17.416 --> 01:48:18.916
I come back and forth a lot.

01:48:19.375 --> 01:48:21.055
- That sounds difficult.
- It is.

01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:24.920
And expensive. I'll try to take him
with me some of the time,

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:27.000
but Nicole doesn't like for him
to fly so much.

01:48:27.083 --> 01:48:30.713
Well, that can be hard on a child,
all that recycled air.

01:48:32.500 --> 01:48:33.920
Well, he's sturdy.

01:48:34.500 --> 01:48:36.790
Some parents won't take their kids
to a restaurant

01:48:36.875 --> 01:48:38.705
because of these superbugs.

01:48:39.291 --> 01:48:41.131
Uh-huh.

01:48:42.916 --> 01:48:46.496
I noticed on one visit to Los Angeles,
you came on a Sunday

01:48:46.583 --> 01:48:48.003
and left on a Thursday.

01:48:48.083 --> 01:48:49.883
Why not stay for a weekend?

01:48:50.375 --> 01:48:55.375
Oh. Um, on that time,
I had tech for Electra in New York.

01:48:55.791 --> 01:48:56.961
What's that?

01:48:57.916 --> 01:48:59.746
It was my Broadway debut.

01:48:59.833 --> 01:49:02.043
Oh, I don't know what "tech" is.

01:49:02.125 --> 01:49:05.575
It's the technical part of the production.
You figure out the lights.

01:49:05.666 --> 01:49:07.851
- And Monday's our day off.
- What's a weekend day like?

01:49:07.875 --> 01:49:10.535
Well, out here, he has basketball
on Saturday at 12.

01:49:10.625 --> 01:49:11.745
Eleven, I'm sorry.

01:49:11.833 --> 01:49:14.253
And so, we go there.
And then, afterwards...

01:49:15.208 --> 01:49:18.708
maybe we'll get lunch somewhere,
and then, if there's a movie to see...

01:49:18.958 --> 01:49:20.578
Does he like basketball?

01:49:20.666 --> 01:49:21.666
He does.

01:49:21.875 --> 01:49:25.245
His coach, uh, Rick, says
he's a good dribbler, and I've seen that.

01:49:25.708 --> 01:49:26.878
- Uh-huh.
- Ron.

01:49:27.708 --> 01:49:29.668
Sorry, his coach's name is Ron.

01:49:29.750 --> 01:49:31.250
Rick's his dentist in New York.

01:49:31.333 --> 01:49:34.543
Well, you know our home home was...
is in New York.

01:49:34.625 --> 01:49:35.955
That's where we live.

01:49:36.041 --> 01:49:38.171
New York is a long way from here.

01:49:38.708 --> 01:49:40.458
Well, we like it because we can walk.

01:49:40.541 --> 01:49:42.041
You can walk here.

01:49:42.416 --> 01:49:43.416
Not really.

01:49:43.458 --> 01:49:44.918
And the space...

01:49:51.291 --> 01:49:52.671
Do you like your school?

01:49:53.625 --> 01:49:54.625
I love it.

01:49:54.958 --> 01:49:57.078
What's your favorite part
about it?

01:49:57.541 --> 01:49:58.541
I don't know.

01:50:00.041 --> 01:50:01.041
Maybe gym.

01:50:01.333 --> 01:50:02.543
You like math.

01:50:03.708 --> 01:50:04.828
Not anymore.

01:50:06.625 --> 01:50:07.825
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

01:50:07.916 --> 01:50:10.416
- But you're getting really good at it.
- No.

01:50:11.541 --> 01:50:12.961
Well, you are, but...

01:50:15.708 --> 01:50:17.998
What do you and your dad
like to do together?

01:50:18.708 --> 01:50:21.288
When I'm at my dad's,
we sometimes watch a movie,

01:50:21.375 --> 01:50:22.995
or build a Lego, or something.

01:50:23.791 --> 01:50:25.631
My dad's a great Lego builder.

01:50:26.041 --> 01:50:27.381
And at your mom's?

01:50:28.125 --> 01:50:31.625
At home, I have most of my toys,
and there's a pool,

01:50:32.125 --> 01:50:34.165
and I have a tree house and jungle gym.

01:50:35.875 --> 01:50:39.285
We have super secret treasure hunt,
which is really fun.

01:50:40.708 --> 01:50:44.208
- Sweetheart?
- Army men ride in here and...

01:50:44.291 --> 01:50:45.921
Want to help me set the table?

01:50:46.500 --> 01:50:47.420
Do I have to?

01:50:47.500 --> 01:50:50.080
- Just come in here and grab a plate.
- I'm playing.

01:50:50.166 --> 01:50:51.166
Henry?

01:50:52.083 --> 01:50:53.463
Okay.

01:50:54.375 --> 01:50:55.375
Fine.

01:50:59.458 --> 01:51:01.288
- Why are you being like this?
- What?

01:51:01.375 --> 01:51:03.245
If I ask you to help out, help out.

01:51:03.333 --> 01:51:05.503
- What is this?
- Special Meal.

01:51:06.333 --> 01:51:07.713
What are the green things?

01:51:08.291 --> 01:51:10.381
There aren't green things in Special Meal.

01:51:10.458 --> 01:51:12.748
- It's just a garnish.
- Ugh.

01:51:12.833 --> 01:51:13.833
I'll take it off.

01:51:14.875 --> 01:51:16.875
I don't want to eat anything it touched.

01:51:16.958 --> 01:51:20.668
- It doesn't change the taste of anything.
- I might want to be a vegetarian.

01:51:21.291 --> 01:51:22.461
Mom's a vegetarian.

01:51:22.541 --> 01:51:23.921
Is she a vegetarian now?

01:51:24.500 --> 01:51:26.300
- Yeah.
- Well, then, you should like garnish.

01:51:26.375 --> 01:51:28.245
It's all garnish, vegetarianism.

01:51:30.291 --> 01:51:31.711
I'm done with my water.

01:51:41.750 --> 01:51:43.040
Sure I can't get you anything?

01:51:43.125 --> 01:51:44.825
No, I'm fine, thank you.

01:51:47.458 --> 01:51:48.828
Do the thing with the knife.

01:51:48.916 --> 01:51:50.746
No, I'm not.

01:51:51.708 --> 01:51:52.708
No.

01:51:53.500 --> 01:51:54.500
Come on.

01:51:54.750 --> 01:51:55.960
It's not a dinner thing.

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:00.460
It's not an any time thing.

01:52:00.958 --> 01:52:02.628
What's the thing with the knife?

01:52:03.458 --> 01:52:04.628
It's hilarious.

01:52:04.708 --> 01:52:07.168
No, it's dumb.
I have a small knife on my keychain,

01:52:07.250 --> 01:52:08.500
which is only for adults.

01:52:10.208 --> 01:52:11.958
And I do a thing with it sometimes.

01:52:13.458 --> 01:52:15.038
You said I could get a knife.

01:52:15.541 --> 01:52:17.421
A jackknife, yeah, when you're older.

01:52:18.125 --> 01:52:19.125
Like ten.

01:52:19.583 --> 01:52:21.003
No, like 20.

01:52:21.666 --> 01:52:22.666
Yeah.

01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:32.250
Dime, rime, lime, pime, sime...

01:52:32.333 --> 01:52:34.373
Honey, stop guessing.
You're so close. Stay with it.

01:52:34.416 --> 01:52:36.536
Ugh, I don't want to do it.

01:52:36.708 --> 01:52:40.208
- What's the first letter?
- I don't want to do it. Can I do the iPad?

01:52:40.291 --> 01:52:41.751
No, look. What's the first letter?

01:52:42.125 --> 01:52:44.285
- I don't want to.
- It's a T. What sound does T make?

01:52:44.375 --> 01:52:46.705
- Tuh.
- Right. Then just do the rest of it.

01:52:47.291 --> 01:52:48.291
Dime.

01:52:49.166 --> 01:52:50.036
No.

01:52:50.125 --> 01:52:52.415
You have "tuh" and "ime." What is that?

01:52:55.541 --> 01:52:56.541
Time.

01:52:57.083 --> 01:52:58.083
It's time.

01:52:59.333 --> 01:53:00.333
It's time.

01:53:05.375 --> 01:53:06.375
You'll see, honey.

01:53:06.458 --> 01:53:09.498
One day, it's just going to click
and you'll be able to read everything.

01:53:10.333 --> 01:53:11.543
I need a break.

01:53:11.958 --> 01:53:13.748
Can I go play in my room?

01:53:13.833 --> 01:53:14.833
Sure.

01:53:17.083 --> 01:53:18.083
Hey.

01:53:20.250 --> 01:53:21.250
Yeah?

01:53:38.625 --> 01:53:40.415
Do you ever observe married people?

01:53:40.500 --> 01:53:41.670
No. Why would I?

01:53:42.500 --> 01:53:44.290
- I was kidding.
- Oh.

01:53:55.666 --> 01:53:58.996
The knife thing is...
I carry this knife on my keychain,

01:53:59.083 --> 01:54:00.793
which his mother got me, actually.

01:54:02.500 --> 01:54:05.000
And I do this thing for his mom
where I pretend to cut myself,

01:54:05.083 --> 01:54:07.753
but I retract the blade,
but I-I don't do it with him.

01:54:11.041 --> 01:54:12.381
Oh.

01:54:13.250 --> 01:54:14.790
- That's fine.
- Are you okay?

01:54:14.875 --> 01:54:17.245
Yeah, I must not have retracted
the blade all the way.

01:54:17.333 --> 01:54:18.793
- Do you need...
- Yeah.

01:54:20.208 --> 01:54:22.378
Yeah, no, it's fine.

01:54:22.791 --> 01:54:24.041
What else can I tell you?

01:54:24.916 --> 01:54:27.916
- Um, I think I have enough.
- You have enough?

01:54:28.416 --> 01:54:30.996
- Are you sure you're okay?
- Totally. I'm fine.

01:54:31.625 --> 01:54:34.535
Uh, well, I'll leave you guys for tonight.

01:54:35.125 --> 01:54:36.125
Oh, okay.

01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:40.080
I'll be in touch
if I have further questions.

01:54:41.166 --> 01:54:42.666
Uh... Oh, thanks.

01:54:42.750 --> 01:54:43.750
Um...

01:54:44.833 --> 01:54:46.463
Oh, thanks. Um...

01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:51.210
Thanks. Thank you for the water.

01:54:51.291 --> 01:54:53.831
- Oh, yeah, sure.
- Are you sure you're okay?

01:54:53.916 --> 01:54:55.286
- Yeah.
- Okay.

01:54:56.250 --> 01:54:57.460
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

01:55:02.416 --> 01:55:03.826
Oh. Sorry.

01:55:05.250 --> 01:55:06.250
All right, let...

01:55:09.041 --> 01:55:10.381
I think you turn the...

01:55:14.125 --> 01:55:15.455
- Okay.
- Sorry.

01:55:15.958 --> 01:55:16.958
Okay.

01:56:20.458 --> 01:56:21.788
Dad, are you okay?

01:56:22.500 --> 01:56:23.880
Yeah, I'm just tired.

01:56:41.083 --> 01:56:42.633
Dad, did she like us?

01:56:44.708 --> 01:56:47.128
Yeah, she thought we were great.

01:58:20.500 --> 01:58:21.540
Guys, slow down.

01:58:23.208 --> 01:58:24.208
So...

01:58:24.375 --> 01:58:26.745
because Charlie dropped his claim
to New York,

01:58:26.833 --> 01:58:27.883
we're mostly done.

01:58:28.166 --> 01:58:29.456
Jay's lost interest,

01:58:29.625 --> 01:58:31.955
and Ted, his associate,
is doing the paperwork.

01:58:32.041 --> 01:58:33.791
And we're not taking any money, right?

01:58:33.875 --> 01:58:36.075
We withdrew our claim for the MacArthur,

01:58:36.166 --> 01:58:38.326
which I think
we could have gotten, by the way,

01:58:38.416 --> 01:58:40.666
and they're not asking
for any of the show.

01:58:41.791 --> 01:58:43.381
Thank you for everything, Nora.

01:58:43.708 --> 01:58:45.128
You're welcome, doll.

01:58:45.875 --> 01:58:47.625
To your new home in LA.

01:58:51.416 --> 01:58:52.416
Mmm.

01:58:52.750 --> 01:58:53.750
And...

01:58:53.916 --> 01:58:55.286
whenever Charlie is in LA,

01:58:55.375 --> 01:58:58.415
I got the custody breakdown to be 55/45.

01:58:58.875 --> 01:59:01.785
So you'll have Henry an extra day
every two weeks.

01:59:02.208 --> 01:59:03.578
I thought we made it equal.

01:59:03.750 --> 01:59:05.420
I tweaked it at the last minute.

01:59:05.500 --> 01:59:08.330
I just didn't want him
to be able to say he got 50/50,

01:59:08.416 --> 01:59:09.876
bragging to his friends.

01:59:10.375 --> 01:59:12.415
- But I don't want to do that.
- Take it.

01:59:12.875 --> 01:59:13.915
You won.

01:59:15.541 --> 01:59:16.541
Uh-huh.

01:59:40.333 --> 01:59:42.583
Hi. You look like a guy
who really cares about animals.

01:59:42.666 --> 01:59:43.666
Nope.

02:00:03.416 --> 02:00:05.206
Oh, my God!

02:00:05.458 --> 02:00:06.458
Hi.

02:00:21.750 --> 02:00:24.130
The couch was technically hers,
pre-marriage.

02:00:24.208 --> 02:00:26.128
But I mean... it was our couch.

02:00:26.208 --> 02:00:28.048
It's not like I was going to buy
another couch.

02:00:28.083 --> 02:00:30.483
But then when it comes time to split,
it's suddenly her couch

02:00:30.541 --> 02:00:31.921
and I have no couch, and...

02:00:32.625 --> 02:00:33.915
Hey, guys, what's up?

02:00:34.791 --> 02:00:37.041
I'm sitting on the floor
is the short version.

02:00:39.666 --> 02:00:42.416
I'm sorry.
This is all so self-pitying and boring.

02:00:42.500 --> 02:00:43.500
No, come on.

02:00:43.583 --> 02:00:45.333
No, it's so stupid. I'm sorry.

02:00:45.416 --> 02:00:48.246
- It sounds really tough.
- No, no, no, no. It is sad.

02:01:07.625 --> 02:01:09.665
It's true, but there's more than that.

02:01:09.875 --> 02:01:11.625
Is that all you think there is to it?

02:01:11.708 --> 02:01:14.068
You have so many reasons
for not being with someone, Robert,

02:01:14.125 --> 02:01:16.165
but you haven't got one good reason
for being alone.

02:01:16.208 --> 02:01:18.708
C'mon, you're onto something.
Robbie, you're onto something.

02:01:31.041 --> 02:01:34.501
You see what you look for, you know?
You're not a kid anymore, Robbie.

02:01:34.583 --> 02:01:36.713
I don't think you'll ever be
a kid again, kiddo.

02:01:48.708 --> 02:01:52.038
Blow out the candles, Robert,
and make a wish.

02:01:52.125 --> 02:01:53.455
Want something.

02:01:54.250 --> 02:01:55.580
Want something.

02:04:08.875 --> 02:04:10.075
Hello?

02:04:19.916 --> 02:04:21.246
Hello?

02:04:22.916 --> 02:04:25.036
- Hi. Sorry, the door was open.
- Shh.

02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:27.040
Oh, okay.

02:04:29.291 --> 02:04:30.501
Whoa! Gotcha!

02:04:30.583 --> 02:04:31.583
Aah!

02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:33.500
Oh, Charlie!

02:04:34.083 --> 02:04:36.583
Oh! Was your flight okay?

02:04:36.666 --> 02:04:38.126
- Yeah.
- Carter.

02:04:38.208 --> 02:04:39.288
Charlie.

02:04:39.375 --> 02:04:40.535
Nicole's still at work.

02:04:48.083 --> 02:04:49.333
- Hi.
- Hi.

02:04:49.416 --> 02:04:50.416
Can I get a hug?

02:04:55.666 --> 02:04:57.076
- Hey, how'd it go?
- Hey.

02:04:57.166 --> 02:05:00.226
Good, yeah. Donny's dead now. We shot
the scene where he merges with the ficus.

02:05:00.250 --> 02:05:02.531
- Henry's upstairs.
- She got an Emmy nomination.

02:05:02.750 --> 02:05:05.210
- She's a great actress.
- No, for directing.

02:05:06.875 --> 02:05:08.705
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

02:05:08.791 --> 02:05:11.541
Now I know what you were
so obsessed with all the time.

02:05:11.625 --> 02:05:13.535
- Um, we should get ready.
- Yeah.

02:05:13.625 --> 02:05:15.517
- We're the Beatles.
- Come on, Charlie.

02:05:15.541 --> 02:05:17.101
I didn't really get a costume together.

02:05:17.125 --> 02:05:19.392
- You could be George Martin.
- I don't need to be anything.

02:05:19.416 --> 02:05:21.767
- You've got to be something.
- A ghost. I'll get you a sheet.

02:05:21.791 --> 02:05:23.934
I have the album cover
if anyone needs to reference it.

02:05:23.958 --> 02:05:26.828
And we should leave soon. I'm saying that
as much for me as anyone else.

02:05:26.916 --> 02:05:29.476
- Am I John or George?
- Trick-or-treating starts at 5:00.

02:05:29.500 --> 02:05:31.059
You're George. Nicole is John.

02:05:37.916 --> 02:05:40.786
I wanted to tell you
I took a residency at UCLA.

02:05:42.416 --> 02:05:44.876
I'm going to direct two plays
in rep at REDCAT.

02:05:46.916 --> 02:05:47.916
Oh.

02:05:48.708 --> 02:05:50.248
So, I'm going to be here for a while.

02:05:53.458 --> 02:05:54.458
That's great.

02:05:57.625 --> 02:05:58.625
Are you okay?

02:06:01.125 --> 02:06:02.125
Yeah.

02:06:04.625 --> 02:06:05.825
It's only good.

02:06:06.125 --> 02:06:07.575
Nicole?

02:06:07.666 --> 02:06:09.706
Can you help me with my zipper?

02:06:30.083 --> 02:06:33.333
"Charlie is... in... cr..."

02:06:33.416 --> 02:06:34.286
...something.

02:06:34.375 --> 02:06:35.375
"...neat

02:06:35.666 --> 02:06:39.076
and I re-ly on him

02:06:39.500 --> 02:06:44.000
to keep things in or-der.

02:06:44.875 --> 02:06:46.745
He is energy con..."

02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:51.210
- I don't know what this word is.
- You're getting so good at reading.

02:06:51.875 --> 02:06:52.995
What is that?

02:06:54.958 --> 02:06:59.498
"He doesn't look in the mirror too of-ten.

02:06:59.958 --> 02:07:02.078
He cries eas-ily

02:07:02.541 --> 02:07:04.541
in movies...

02:07:05.625 --> 02:07:08.245
He is very self-suf..."

02:07:09.166 --> 02:07:10.206
Self-sufficient.

02:07:11.666 --> 02:07:14.826
"He can dar-n a sock..."

02:07:14.916 --> 02:07:17.456
That means sew, like a hole.

02:07:18.083 --> 02:07:21.083
"...and cook himself dinner

02:07:21.541 --> 02:07:24.421
and ir..."

02:07:24.500 --> 02:07:25.710
Break it into two parts.

02:07:26.083 --> 02:07:27.793
"...Ur. On."

02:07:27.875 --> 02:07:29.535
Not "ur" but "ire."

02:07:29.833 --> 02:07:30.923
Ire. On.

02:07:31.000 --> 02:07:32.000
Iron.

02:07:33.833 --> 02:07:35.043
"...a shirt.

02:07:36.916 --> 02:07:40.206
He rarely gets def-eated,

02:07:40.500 --> 02:07:42.960
which I fell...

02:07:44.291 --> 02:07:47.631
feel like I always do.

02:07:48.666 --> 02:07:52.036
Charlie takes all of my moods stead-ily.

02:07:52.625 --> 02:07:54.825
He doesn't give in to them

02:07:55.166 --> 02:07:57.576
or make me feel bad about them.

02:07:58.458 --> 02:08:00.788
He's a great dress-er
and never looks em..."

02:08:01.291 --> 02:08:03.381
- I don't know this one.
- Embarrassing.

02:08:04.208 --> 02:08:05.208
"...embarrassing,

02:08:05.666 --> 02:08:09.036
wh-ich is hard for a man."

02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:11.040
You read it now.

02:08:13.333 --> 02:08:14.753
"He's very competitive.

02:08:15.875 --> 02:08:17.575
He loves being a dad.

02:08:18.625 --> 02:08:20.995
He loves all the things
you're supposed to hate,

02:08:21.416 --> 02:08:22.826
like the tantrums,

02:08:23.333 --> 02:08:24.753
the waking up at night.

02:08:25.375 --> 02:08:27.915
It's almost annoying
how much he likes it,

02:08:28.291 --> 02:08:29.671
but then, it's mostly nice.

02:08:30.958 --> 02:08:32.998
He disappears into his own world.

02:08:33.083 --> 02:08:35.173
He and Henry are alike that way.

02:08:36.666 --> 02:08:37.876
He can tell...

02:08:38.208 --> 02:08:40.998
people they have food in their teeth

02:08:41.708 --> 02:08:44.578
or on their face in a way
that doesn't make them feel bad.

02:08:45.500 --> 02:08:46.880
Charlie is self made.

02:08:47.250 --> 02:08:49.710
His parents, I only met them once,

02:08:49.791 --> 02:08:52.581
but he told me
there was a lot of alcohol...

02:08:56.250 --> 02:08:58.750
He moved to New York from Indiana

02:08:59.291 --> 02:09:00.421
with no safety net,

02:09:00.500 --> 02:09:03.250
and now he's more New Yorker
than any New Yorker.

02:09:04.041 --> 02:09:07.041
He's brilliant at creating family
out of whoever is around.

02:09:07.416 --> 02:09:08.786
With the theater company...

02:09:09.666 --> 02:09:11.166
he casts a spell...

02:09:11.791 --> 02:09:14.251
that made everyone feel included.

02:09:14.791 --> 02:09:17.541
No one, not even an intern,
was unimportant."

02:09:18.916 --> 02:09:19.956
What's an intern?

02:09:20.166 --> 02:09:21.536
Uh, it's like a...

02:09:22.583 --> 02:09:24.173
helper, but who isn't paid.

02:09:24.375 --> 02:09:25.575
Why aren't they paid?

02:09:26.833 --> 02:09:28.583
They're young, they're learning.

02:09:30.041 --> 02:09:32.921
I don't know, maybe if they do a good job,
they get paid later.

02:09:33.166 --> 02:09:34.376
Okay, keep going.

02:09:35.708 --> 02:09:39.628
"He could remember all the inside jokes,
he's extremely organized and thorough,

02:09:39.833 --> 02:09:43.253
he's very clear about what he wants,
unlike me who can't always tell.

02:09:43.791 --> 02:09:46.831
I fell in love with him
two seconds after I saw him.

02:10:10.583 --> 02:10:12.213
And I'll never stop loving him,

02:10:12.541 --> 02:10:14.671
even though
it doesn't make sense anymore."

02:10:28.875 --> 02:10:31.325
- See you. Good seeing you.
- Good seeing you too.

02:10:31.416 --> 02:10:33.076
- Oh, Charlie!
- G-ma.

02:10:33.166 --> 02:10:34.786
I'm so happy you came.

02:10:35.416 --> 02:10:36.826
I'll email you that article.

02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:38.080
- Yes, please do.
- Yeah.

02:10:38.166 --> 02:10:40.326
- All right. Thank you.
- Take care.

02:10:44.541 --> 02:10:47.501
We were going to bring him to dinner,
but he's so wiped out.

02:10:47.583 --> 02:10:48.673
You want to take him?

02:10:50.083 --> 02:10:52.043
- It's your night.
- I know.

02:10:52.125 --> 02:10:54.059
- Yeah. I'll drop him back in the morning.
- Good.

02:10:54.083 --> 02:10:56.309
Yeah, text me when you're up.
We'll figure something out.

02:10:56.333 --> 02:10:58.173
You're going to go with your dad, okay?

02:10:58.250 --> 02:10:59.420
- Okay.
- Yeah?

02:11:10.500 --> 02:11:12.080
I love you.

02:11:12.875 --> 02:11:14.075
I love you too.

02:11:19.916 --> 02:11:20.916
Oh, hey.

02:11:33.041 --> 02:11:34.041
Thanks.
