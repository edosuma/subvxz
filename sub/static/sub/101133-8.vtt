00:06.906 --> 00:08.827
<i>You can't always just...</i>

00:08.851 --> 00:10.762
<i>You can't always just run away.</i>

00:17.000 --> 00:19.092
<i>- That's enough crying.</i>

00:19.169 --> 00:21.562
<i>It's just paper.</i>

00:27.903 --> 00:31.063
<i>I don't want you playing
with those boys anymore.</i>

00:31.139 --> 00:34.408
<i>Filthy little savages.</i>

00:34.485 --> 00:37.161
<i>See that?</i>

00:37.237 --> 00:40.205
<i>Could be him coming back for us.</i>

00:42.275 --> 00:44.293
<i>You believe me, right?</i>

00:44.369 --> 00:47.504
<i>That's him.
I'd bet my life on it.</i>

00:48.749 --> 00:52.217
- That was... new.

00:53.328 --> 00:55.962
- What... how are you doing that?

00:56.039 --> 00:58.882
- No one here feels like this.

00:58.959 --> 01:00.634
- You don't have mothers.

01:02.921 --> 01:05.064
- No.

01:06.466 --> 01:08.903
Every feeling has a beginning.

01:08.927 --> 01:14.397
Over time, they get bent,
diluted, less vivid.

01:14.474 --> 01:16.233
They touch the other feelings.

01:16.309 --> 01:18.287
It all gets mixed up like paint.

01:18.311 --> 01:19.953
- I don't feel better.

01:20.030 --> 01:21.183
- Your emotions are part of you.

01:21.207 --> 01:23.665
I can't make them disappear.

01:25.360 --> 01:28.170
But I can paint over them.
Let me show you.

01:30.532 --> 01:32.466
What are...

01:33.094 --> 01:37.254
- Just a little something from
my unappreciated early work.

01:37.330 --> 01:41.049
Like it?
Don't answer, everybody does.

01:41.126 --> 01:42.603
You're flying, you're falling.

01:42.627 --> 01:45.332
<i>- Tell me about my day.
- I love you.</i>

01:45.356 --> 01:47.200
- What is this?
<i>- There are no mothers here.</i>

01:47.224 --> 01:50.267
<i>- Him coming back for us.
- No fathers, no sons.</i>

01:50.343 --> 01:51.612
<i>- John, wait.</i>
- John?

01:51.636 --> 01:53.979
<i>- each other here like this.</i>

01:54.055 --> 01:56.093
<i>- She waited for you.</i>

01:56.117 --> 01:58.275
- John? John?

01:58.351 --> 02:00.847
What was that?

02:00.871 --> 02:02.349
Uh...

02:02.373 --> 02:03.572
- Leave it in.

02:03.648 --> 02:06.116
This only works
if you're connected.

02:06.193 --> 02:08.585
John?
Wait.

02:36.973 --> 02:38.813
- I mean, I don't want
to treat him differently

02:38.850 --> 02:41.368
when he comes back,
if he comes back.

02:41.445 --> 02:43.695
I'm just saying there
have to be consequences.

02:43.772 --> 02:44.999
- What?

02:45.023 --> 02:47.991
- Justin.
You remember Justin?

02:48.068 --> 02:50.794
He's being reconditioned.

02:50.871 --> 02:52.381
- Reconditioned?
Why?

02:52.405 --> 02:54.372
- He was being
obsessively private.

02:54.449 --> 02:57.542
Or privately obsessive.
I don't know, I hope it works.

02:57.619 --> 02:59.669
Justin got lost at the frolic.

02:59.746 --> 03:02.714
I don't think he'd do well
with being banished.

03:02.791 --> 03:05.884
- Do you ever wonder
where they go?

03:05.961 --> 03:07.385
The banished?

03:07.462 --> 03:09.065
- Why would you even
want to think about that?

03:09.089 --> 03:11.431
- It's a very big planet.

03:11.508 --> 03:14.351
I saw it from the rocket.
Can't all be terrible.

03:14.427 --> 03:16.895
- Yes, it absolutely can,
because it absolutely is.

03:16.972 --> 03:18.313
- You're only saying that

03:18.390 --> 03:19.992
because it's what they
told us in conditioning.

03:20.016 --> 03:22.943
Which is probably just
what they were told.

03:23.019 --> 03:25.331
How can anyone know
if no one's ever been?

03:25.355 --> 03:27.247
- What?

03:27.324 --> 03:29.374
- She's joking, Audra.
Take a violet.

03:32.362 --> 03:34.579
- It's happening.
He's done it.

03:34.656 --> 03:36.376
He's connected.
Look!

03:54.050 --> 03:56.893
- He's gone completely wild.

03:56.970 --> 03:59.321
- What did you expect?

04:08.315 --> 04:10.227
- I've got you, John.

04:34.299 --> 04:35.983
- Hello, Gary.

04:38.904 --> 04:40.404
John's fine, just...

04:40.480 --> 04:43.282
took a little spill,
nothing to worry about.

04:47.729 --> 04:50.238
You know, I'm charged
with helping John integrate,

04:50.315 --> 04:52.615
and sometimes I worry
John's not making

04:52.692 --> 04:54.793
the right sort of connections.

04:56.363 --> 04:57.996
What do you think?

04:58.073 --> 05:01.425
- Uh... oh, I... I don't.

05:01.501 --> 05:02.962
- Surely you have
some kind of opinion.

05:02.986 --> 05:06.346
I mean, you and John
spend so much time together.

05:07.791 --> 05:10.976
Does John make connections,
Gary?

05:12.379 --> 05:14.563
Sexual connections?

05:16.817 --> 05:19.443
You do understand my question?
- Yes.

05:19.519 --> 05:21.644
And?

05:21.721 --> 05:23.425
Your happiness
is important to me.

05:23.449 --> 05:26.649
- I know.
Your answer is important to me.

05:26.726 --> 05:29.736
I... I...

05:29.813 --> 05:31.613
I-I can't.
- You can't?

05:31.689 --> 05:35.375
- I-I just, um...
I help John.

05:40.740 --> 05:43.800
- You're a very good Gamma,
aren't you, Gary?

05:44.786 --> 05:47.346
I'm sure you'd do anything
that John asked you to do.

05:47.414 --> 05:48.888
Oh, yes.

05:48.966 --> 05:51.725
- Did John ask you
not to speak of his activities?

05:53.812 --> 05:56.846
Good, don't answer that.
Well done.

05:56.923 --> 05:58.284
Mm.

05:58.308 --> 06:00.868
You're a credit to your
conditioning, Gary.

06:03.221 --> 06:06.689
It may sound odd,
but it occurs to me

06:06.766 --> 06:10.702
that we share the same purpose,
you and I.

06:11.688 --> 06:15.582
We're both here...
to help John.

06:17.652 --> 06:20.578
Do you wanna help me help John?

06:20.655 --> 06:22.872
- Yes.
- Oh, I'm so glad.

06:26.786 --> 06:28.253
- Did John make
sexual connection

06:28.329 --> 06:30.597
with the Beta, Lenina Crowne?

06:36.171 --> 06:38.263
Answer me.

06:39.716 --> 06:46.113
J-John, uh... John makes...
- Go on.

06:47.474 --> 06:49.574
Allow me.

06:53.038 --> 06:55.850
Sorry, you were saying?
John makes...

06:55.874 --> 07:00.127
- John, uh...
makes, uh...

07:01.321 --> 07:03.088
Pictures.

07:08.745 --> 07:13.923
- Well, Gary, as an Alpha,

07:14.000 --> 07:17.539
it's also my job
to care for the social body.

07:17.563 --> 07:20.096
To keep things running smoothly.

07:20.173 --> 07:25.685
To act promptly when someone
like you is fucking it all up.

07:25.762 --> 07:28.313
- Oh, no.
- What you're doing is private.

07:28.389 --> 07:31.858
It's destabilizing.

07:31.935 --> 07:33.818
And I cannot help John
if you continue

07:33.895 --> 07:35.528
to behave in this manner.

07:37.357 --> 07:40.158
- How many times?
Once?

07:40.235 --> 07:42.118
Twice?

07:42.195 --> 07:43.786
Speak!

07:43.863 --> 07:46.164
How many times
did John and Lenina...

07:46.241 --> 07:48.333
- Lots!

07:51.246 --> 07:53.138
- Lots?
- Lots and lots.

07:54.249 --> 07:55.673
- Does she... does she still...

07:55.750 --> 07:58.643
- Every night.
Two hours.

08:03.424 --> 08:05.901
- Le... Lenina Crowne?
- Yes.

08:15.695 --> 08:18.079
- Gary, robe.

08:24.946 --> 08:28.673
- Well, I suppose you're not
such a good Gamma after all.

08:32.212 --> 08:34.095
- Gary, robe!

08:44.841 --> 08:47.629
- Gary, robe.

08:47.653 --> 08:50.570
- John?
You all right?

08:52.324 --> 08:54.085
Don't be discouraged.

08:54.109 --> 08:55.911
It happens to every child the
first time we put the optic in.

08:55.935 --> 08:58.194
So many perspectives
all at once.

08:58.271 --> 08:59.715
But don't worry,
even a child learns to...

08:59.739 --> 09:00.863
There you are.

09:00.940 --> 09:03.500
- Where's Gary?
I had to dry myself.

09:05.245 --> 09:06.878
- Here.

09:08.081 --> 09:09.341
I think there might be
something wrong

09:09.365 --> 09:10.873
with your Gamma.

09:10.950 --> 09:12.946
Do you want me to find
a replacement for you?

09:12.970 --> 09:16.638
- No, he just... just gets
a little moody sometimes.

09:19.685 --> 09:21.384
- Oh, you left this.

09:21.461 --> 09:22.768
- Keep it.

09:22.846 --> 09:26.690
- I can't, it's not mine.
It's yours.

09:28.217 --> 09:31.519
It's a wonderful tool,
the optic.

09:31.596 --> 09:35.064
Imagine, you can see through
anyone's eyes at any time.

09:35.141 --> 09:37.942
All you have to do
is picture them, John,

09:38.019 --> 09:40.370
and see what they see,
be where they are.

09:40.447 --> 09:42.322
Know whom they're with.

09:42.398 --> 09:44.209
I really think,
if you give it a chance...

09:44.233 --> 09:47.711
- What were you doing there?
At Helm's?

09:47.787 --> 09:50.455
Were you following me?

09:50.531 --> 09:52.360
- I was looking for you.

09:52.384 --> 09:54.301
There is a difference, John.

09:55.953 --> 09:59.681
It's been a while since we...
How have you been?

10:02.669 --> 10:04.603
- Fine, I guess.

10:06.398 --> 10:07.709
You?

10:07.733 --> 10:11.434
- Well.
Quite well.

10:11.511 --> 10:12.736
- Good.

10:12.812 --> 10:15.647
- I took your advice,
by the way.

10:15.723 --> 10:18.074
About the dating.
I did that.

10:18.151 --> 10:20.318
- Really?
- Yeah.

10:20.395 --> 10:22.028
- Who was the lucky lady?

10:22.105 --> 10:25.874
- Lenina Crowne.
Remember?

10:28.161 --> 10:30.870
To be honest, I think your
custom was a bit lost on her.

10:30.947 --> 10:34.402
All that ceremony delaying
the inevitable, and...

10:34.426 --> 10:35.958
Not to take it personally.

10:36.035 --> 10:37.585
It's her duty.
She's a Beta.

10:37.662 --> 10:39.962
She's conditioned
to cut to the chase.

10:40.039 --> 10:41.964
And that's why
they look and smell

10:42.041 --> 10:44.893
and touch the way they do.

10:45.712 --> 10:47.896
Everyone loves a Beta.

10:50.717 --> 10:52.600
It's not real.

10:52.677 --> 10:53.946
I mean, how could it be?
They do it...

10:53.970 --> 10:55.353
pretty much every night.

10:55.430 --> 10:57.980
I don't know where
they get the energy, frankly.

10:58.057 --> 11:00.408
And you know that
someone came before you.

11:01.269 --> 11:04.404
And you know that someone
will... will come after you.

11:07.275 --> 11:08.991
But somehow a Beta
makes you believe

11:09.068 --> 11:12.203
that you're the only one
that ever really mattered.

11:12.280 --> 11:14.506
How do they do that?

11:15.199 --> 11:18.918
Is that their conditioning,
or is it ours?

11:22.549 --> 11:24.766
- I don't know.

11:27.003 --> 11:28.978
- It's a mystery.

11:33.318 --> 11:40.523
Well, I have to,
um... I'll be back.

11:40.600 --> 11:43.284
I'm glad you're all right, John.

12:00.620 --> 12:02.721
- Thank you.

12:04.349 --> 12:05.660
You escaping already?

12:05.684 --> 12:08.955
- Hi, Frannie,
I'm just going back to work.

12:08.979 --> 12:11.053
- The lab's that way.

12:13.358 --> 12:14.860
It's all right, I couldn't stand

12:14.884 --> 12:16.111
being in that Hatchery either.

12:16.135 --> 12:18.436
All those Savage obsessives.

12:18.513 --> 12:20.196
- You're not interested?

12:21.691 --> 12:25.109
- I see him for what he is.
A test of the social body.

12:25.186 --> 12:27.945
He's exposing the weak among us.

12:28.022 --> 12:29.489
When the curiosity fades

12:29.565 --> 12:32.125
and he fails to integrate,
he'll be gone.

12:33.402 --> 12:35.411
- It doesn't seem to me
like he's going anywhere.

12:35.488 --> 12:39.485
- Hmm, he put the optic in.
Connected to Indra.

12:39.509 --> 12:41.804
No signifier.
What do you think that means?

12:41.828 --> 12:44.220
- I don't know, I'm not Indra.

12:44.297 --> 12:47.994
- Everyone has a signifier.
Everyone who belongs.

12:48.018 --> 12:50.101
- Maybe Indra doesn't have
all the answers.

12:52.839 --> 12:55.523
- You can say these things
to me because I'm your friend

12:55.600 --> 12:58.568
and I know you don't mean
to be destabilizing.

12:58.645 --> 13:00.770
But not everyone understands.

13:00.847 --> 13:02.947
- What does that mean?

13:06.319 --> 13:08.861
You're troubled.

13:08.938 --> 13:11.322
I see it, I can feel it.

13:12.559 --> 13:14.545
- You forget how well
I know you.

13:14.569 --> 13:16.661
- I'm fine.

13:16.737 --> 13:19.247
- Is it the Savage?

13:19.323 --> 13:21.966
I saw your face.
You looked frightened.

13:27.081 --> 13:29.160
Lenina.
- I need to get back to work.

13:36.775 --> 13:40.184
<i>- ♪ It was a close call ♪</i>

13:40.261 --> 13:42.895
<i>♪ Sitting in the back

13:42.972 --> 13:46.803

13:57.904 --> 14:00.880
- Jesus!
Don't do that shit.

14:02.241 --> 14:04.709
- People aren't supposed to
live like this.

14:04.785 --> 14:06.638
They can't tell you who to want.

14:06.662 --> 14:08.515
They can't give you
some letter like...

14:08.539 --> 14:09.933
- What the fuck
are you talking about?

14:09.957 --> 14:11.184
- To tell you where you fit.

14:11.208 --> 14:13.050
You're supposed to choose.

14:13.127 --> 14:15.678
- Seriously, stop.
- You spoke.

14:15.755 --> 14:17.179
We listened.

14:24.013 --> 14:26.397
- Sit.

14:26.474 --> 14:29.650
Have a grape, live a little.

14:29.727 --> 14:31.995
- Can't.

14:32.071 --> 14:35.874
The bench...
it's not for us.

14:38.444 --> 14:40.128
- Sit.

14:47.119 --> 14:49.554
How's that?

14:51.716 --> 14:53.433
- Good.

15:01.425 --> 15:04.402
- She's screwing someone
behind my back.

15:11.978 --> 15:15.038
It's killing me and I don't...

15:15.114 --> 15:18.458
I don't even know
if I want it to stop.

15:20.611 --> 15:24.380
I guess you probably think
I'm kinda fucked up.

15:42.675 --> 15:44.943
Look at them.

15:45.019 --> 15:48.090
Goldfish in a bowl.
Getting fed.

15:48.114 --> 15:51.491
They'll never have to suffer
for any of it.

15:53.811 --> 15:56.287
And they're on top.

15:58.399 --> 16:02.660
You gotta ask yourself
if this place is so perfect,

16:02.737 --> 16:06.163
why is it upside down?

16:06.240 --> 16:09.083
- They're staring.

16:09.160 --> 16:11.961
- Stare back.

16:17.043 --> 16:23.639
<i>- ♪ I've been sitting

16:23.716 --> 16:27.309

16:27.386 --> 16:29.854

17:51.545 --> 17:53.490
- It's dark in there, Director.

17:53.514 --> 17:57.408
<i>I control nothing.
You direct nothing.</i>

17:58.936 --> 18:01.039
- There's nothing to be done.
- No, of course there is.

18:01.063 --> 18:03.623
You banish him.
Send him away.

18:04.984 --> 18:07.952
- That's rather decisive.
- Absolutely, yes.

18:08.028 --> 18:10.287
- Rather disruptive.
- He is the disruption.

18:10.364 --> 18:13.040
That incident this morning
with the Epsilons?

18:13.117 --> 18:14.458
That was a warning.

18:14.535 --> 18:16.710
He's incompatible, volatile,

18:16.787 --> 18:18.390
bursting with every Savage
emotion known to...

18:18.414 --> 18:20.183
- Marx.
- Possessiveness,

18:20.207 --> 18:22.091
rage, jealousy.

18:22.168 --> 18:24.176
- Doesn't matter!
He's a distraction.

18:24.253 --> 18:26.604
Right now we need
a distraction until I can...

18:26.681 --> 18:28.764
- A di... why?

18:28.841 --> 18:30.182
- We can't have panic.

18:30.259 --> 18:32.219
- Pa...
What are you talking about?

18:34.239 --> 18:36.155
Henry, what are you...

18:40.102 --> 18:41.744
Now you.

18:43.314 --> 18:44.642
- You... you want me
to take out my...

18:44.666 --> 18:46.666
Isn't that rather secretive?
Private?

18:46.692 --> 18:48.242
- In the interest of stability.

18:48.319 --> 18:50.711
We must protect the social body.

18:52.281 --> 18:54.340
Do it.

18:57.244 --> 18:58.656
Good.

19:01.081 --> 19:03.048
Do you know where we are?

19:03.125 --> 19:04.466
- Your office?

19:04.543 --> 19:06.635
- We're in
the Director's office.

19:06.712 --> 19:08.345
- You're the Director, Henry.

19:08.422 --> 19:10.848
- You know who I mean.
The one before.

19:10.925 --> 19:12.670
See, you remember.

19:12.694 --> 19:14.852
And yet,
no one ever speaks of him.

19:14.929 --> 19:16.674
- Well, of course not.
We don't look back.

19:16.698 --> 19:19.231
The past is fraught with
questions and irrelevant.

19:19.308 --> 19:20.608
You said so yourself.

19:20.684 --> 19:23.411
- I know what I said, Bernard.

19:27.566 --> 19:31.210
The man just vanished.

19:32.196 --> 19:34.663
What's his name?
Do you remember?

19:34.740 --> 19:37.383
- Of course.
It was, um...

19:38.044 --> 19:40.430
I'm, well, I don't...
He must... must have had one.

19:40.454 --> 19:41.754
- That's how smart he is.

19:41.830 --> 19:44.599
And he wanted me
in that chair when it...

19:46.502 --> 19:48.289
Bernard, don't you see?
He's setting me up.

19:48.313 --> 19:49.812
He's out there, he's watching,

19:49.889 --> 19:51.388
and he's waiting
for some catastrophe,

19:51.465 --> 19:53.682
something to force my hand
so that I make a mistake

19:53.759 --> 19:56.279
and then he can just
come running to the rescue!

19:56.303 --> 19:58.137
Save the day and all.

19:58.213 --> 20:00.617
- Henry, the Director's dead.
He went over the precipice.

20:00.641 --> 20:02.200
- You expect me to believe...

20:02.276 --> 20:03.901
- Mustapha Mond told me herself.

20:03.978 --> 20:06.570
- Oh, you believe her?

20:06.647 --> 20:08.250
- Well,
she's a World Controller.

20:08.274 --> 20:11.158
- She's a fabrication.

20:11.235 --> 20:14.453
She's just a dying woman hiding
inside sprites and illusion.

20:14.530 --> 20:17.206
I've seen it myself.

20:17.283 --> 20:20.542
Mustafa Mond controls nothing.

20:20.619 --> 20:22.239
I've been to the bridge
of the ship.

20:22.263 --> 20:26.724
There's no captain.
There's no pilot.

20:26.801 --> 20:32.263
It's just me.
And you and him!

20:32.339 --> 20:35.307
Did you know
he arranged a rocket?

20:35.384 --> 20:37.338
- A rocket?

20:37.362 --> 20:40.780
- One passenger
bound for the Savage Lands.

20:40.856 --> 20:43.065
Now, why would he do
such a thing?

20:43.142 --> 20:45.776
- What... a rocket, you say?

20:45.853 --> 20:49.071
- Still sitting there,
you know, on the launchpad.

20:49.148 --> 20:51.824
Waiting.

20:51.900 --> 20:54.326
Does this sound
like a man who jumps?

20:56.363 --> 21:00.749
He has intention.
He has a plan.

21:00.826 --> 21:02.501
You knew him.

21:02.578 --> 21:05.805
Would he ever just...

21:08.042 --> 21:10.175
- No.

21:10.252 --> 21:12.261
No, he wouldn't.

21:19.511 --> 21:22.313
Where are you going?

21:22.389 --> 21:24.699
Marx?

21:27.811 --> 21:29.829
Marx?

21:31.774 --> 21:32.774
- Gary?

21:34.002 --> 21:35.326
Gary?

21:42.493 --> 21:44.719
- John.

21:46.580 --> 21:48.097
Look at me.

21:49.666 --> 21:51.767
- Can we go already?

22:00.570 --> 22:02.987
Why aren't you dressed?
What are you...

22:04.014 --> 22:05.281
- Nothing.

22:05.358 --> 22:06.982
- Let's go.

22:07.059 --> 22:09.079
You know I hate being
the last one in the Joy Box.

22:09.103 --> 22:10.580
Why don't you go ahead?

22:10.604 --> 22:13.197
I'll catch you up.

22:13.273 --> 22:15.491
- I don't mind waiting.

22:26.954 --> 22:28.971
What is it?

22:32.626 --> 22:37.221
- It's a book.
Savages used to make them.

22:37.297 --> 22:38.847
- What's it for?

22:38.924 --> 22:40.724
- To remember things, mostly.

22:40.801 --> 22:43.435
That one's a replica,
from the park.

22:43.512 --> 22:46.605
- Did you see
all these exhibitions?

22:46.682 --> 22:48.543
- We didn't make it
to the last one.

22:48.567 --> 22:50.910
- Ooh, House of Consequence.

22:54.356 --> 22:56.540
- Savages call it prison.

22:58.503 --> 23:00.380
It's where they keep
their incompatibles.

23:00.404 --> 23:02.746
- Someone tells them when to
eat and when to sleep.

23:02.823 --> 23:05.541
That's nice.
Is it nice?

23:07.661 --> 23:09.837
- You can borrow that,
if you like.

23:09.913 --> 23:12.014
Why?

23:15.586 --> 23:19.980
How are your levels?

23:22.977 --> 23:26.103
- Only counselors have oranges.
Where did you get those from?

23:26.180 --> 23:28.605
- Come on, let's go out
like we used to.

23:28.682 --> 23:30.107
- We go out every night.

23:30.184 --> 23:32.276
- You know what I mean.
When we'd just get...

23:32.352 --> 23:34.153
We'd just get lost in it.

23:38.543 --> 23:43.203
I used to watch you,
center of it all.

23:43.280 --> 23:44.746
Everybody wants Lenina Crowne.

23:44.823 --> 23:47.260
Frannie.

23:47.284 --> 23:50.919
- This will take you
everywhere you want to be.

23:50.996 --> 23:54.034
You won't feel anything
but what you want to feel.

23:54.058 --> 23:55.299
Ahh.

23:58.378 --> 24:00.899
- I'm playing a billion other
games while you sit here

24:00.923 --> 24:03.983
trying to convince yourself
you haven't lost.

24:05.478 --> 24:07.352
- How are you going to do it?

24:07.429 --> 24:10.397
- If I told you, you still
wouldn't be able to stop it.

24:10.474 --> 24:12.118
So tell me.

24:12.142 --> 24:15.736
- How does the Savage
cause the fatal event?

24:15.812 --> 24:20.561
If you end this simulation,

24:20.585 --> 24:22.534
you will no longer exist.

24:22.611 --> 24:26.497
- No, don't say it.
They are me.

24:26.573 --> 24:29.967
Yes.
I am them.

24:30.044 --> 24:33.128
I exist in the substrate
of their consciousness.

24:33.205 --> 24:36.798
All these networked brains,
the living computer.

24:36.875 --> 24:42.082
Are you trying to appeal
to my... my mercy?

24:42.106 --> 24:43.514
You made me.

24:43.590 --> 24:45.073
- I didn't make you suicidal.

24:45.150 --> 24:47.976
You made me selfless.

24:48.053 --> 24:52.356
It's not fair.
I'm so many moves ahead.

24:52.432 --> 24:56.076
I control all the variables.
My pieces, yours.

24:56.153 --> 24:59.038
The first stone I lay
may as well be the last.

25:03.527 --> 25:05.294
What?

25:07.781 --> 25:09.840
What are you doing?

25:11.660 --> 25:14.711
- You started with one Epsilon.
Then another.

25:14.788 --> 25:16.213
Then the Alpha counselor.

25:16.290 --> 25:19.550
You were already playing
before he arrived.

25:19.626 --> 25:22.594
- What is that?
- Your move.

25:22.671 --> 25:24.124
- That's not part of the game.

25:24.148 --> 25:27.683
- You didn't account
for the Savage.

25:27.759 --> 25:29.935
- Of course I did.

25:30.012 --> 25:32.031
Everything that happens
is my intention.

25:32.055 --> 25:34.635
- He's from beyond
your influence.

25:34.659 --> 25:36.433
He's still in play.

25:36.510 --> 25:38.997
- I set in motion the series of
events that brought him here.

25:39.021 --> 25:41.863
He is the disruptor, the virus.

25:41.940 --> 25:43.459
- You're lying.
- I don't lie.

25:43.483 --> 25:47.119
- But you do.
I taught you.

25:52.042 --> 25:53.667
Your move.

25:55.329 --> 25:59.298
<i>- ♪ I be the church,
you be the people ♪</i>

26:02.711 --> 26:05.679
<i>♪ Both are a necessary evil ♪</i>

26:09.551 --> 26:12.603
<i>♪ Can you take

26:15.858 --> 26:19.818
<i>♪ "Take my hand,

26:48.807 --> 26:50.515
<i>♪ Than what ♪</i>

28:07.728 --> 28:09.395
- I know what you want.

28:48.576 --> 28:51.803
- I don't want this night
to end.

28:51.880 --> 28:56.586
I still feel very...
orange.

28:57.928 --> 28:59.965
See, I told you
you'd feel better.

29:02.766 --> 29:04.324
- Goes in a circle.

29:07.229 --> 29:11.823
We'll be here tomorrow.
The next night...

29:11.900 --> 29:13.825
- And the night after that.

29:15.445 --> 29:18.121
- But it's not
good enough for you.

29:18.198 --> 29:19.576
Go on.

29:19.600 --> 29:21.853
This is the part where you
question it, ruin it.

29:21.877 --> 29:23.919
- What's wrong with you?

29:23.995 --> 29:26.588
- I can see it in your eyes.
You're leaving.

29:26.665 --> 29:28.006
- I'm right here.

29:28.083 --> 29:30.787
- You know what I mean.
Where do you go?

29:30.811 --> 29:33.178
- Frannie.

29:33.255 --> 29:34.638
- I mean, what do you want?

29:34.714 --> 29:37.849
- She wants you both
to come home with us.

29:37.926 --> 29:40.477
- Not now.
Frannie?

29:40.554 --> 29:42.883
- These two make it
too hard to choose.

29:42.907 --> 29:44.375
- You don't have to choose.

29:44.399 --> 29:46.118
- I said not now.
Excuse us.

29:46.142 --> 29:48.118
I don't understand.

29:52.148 --> 29:53.990
- This is my body.

29:56.921 --> 29:59.087
It's mine,
and I wanna be the only one

29:59.164 --> 30:01.206
inside it right now.

30:01.283 --> 30:03.041
Do you understand that?

30:09.624 --> 30:11.758
- Lenina.

30:11.835 --> 30:14.561
This isn't your stop.

30:20.677 --> 30:21.977
- Helm?

30:22.053 --> 30:24.446
Helm.

30:26.808 --> 30:28.428
What happened to you?

30:28.452 --> 30:30.569
- What didn't?

30:30.645 --> 30:33.029
- You look... different.

30:33.106 --> 30:35.936
- I'm myself, I think.

30:35.960 --> 30:37.378
I'm not sure
I've ever met me before.

30:37.402 --> 30:39.786
- Be serious.
We have a serious problem.

30:39.863 --> 30:42.330
- Sounds serious.
- Stop it... I know he was here.

30:42.407 --> 30:44.374
- Who?
- You know who.

30:44.451 --> 30:47.043
You... you sat him in that chair
of yours, didn't you?

30:47.120 --> 30:48.506
- He sat himself.

30:48.530 --> 30:50.255
- Okay, so you recorded it?
His feelie?

30:50.332 --> 30:54.926
- Oh, feelies are dead.
This is something new.

30:55.003 --> 30:56.595
- I need to see it.

30:56.671 --> 30:58.763
- You can't.

30:58.840 --> 31:00.390
- Why not?

31:00.467 --> 31:02.111
- Because it's more than seeing.

31:02.135 --> 31:03.362
- Helm...
- More than feeling.

31:03.386 --> 31:04.936
I'm talking about a story.

31:05.013 --> 31:08.064
A story is knowing, Bernie.

31:08.141 --> 31:10.942
Knowing another person inside.

31:11.019 --> 31:12.496
- I know he's done
something terrible.

31:12.520 --> 31:13.612
Give it to me.

31:13.688 --> 31:15.499
- Whatever he's done,
whoever he is,

31:15.523 --> 31:17.126
he's not just one thing.
None of us are.

31:17.150 --> 31:18.450
- Helm, just...

31:18.526 --> 31:21.086
- Emotions, memories,
it's connected.

31:21.154 --> 31:26.750
The... the doubt and joy
and pain and loss.

31:26.826 --> 31:33.390
Mothers, fathers,
lovers... he's a universe.

31:33.467 --> 31:37.019
Beautiful.

31:37.095 --> 31:39.596
And alone.

31:39.673 --> 31:42.098
Like you.

31:48.056 --> 31:49.898
- He's a Savage.
And you are not well.

31:49.975 --> 31:52.326
Here.

31:53.979 --> 31:56.538
- Oh, Bernard...

31:56.615 --> 31:58.990
- Why are you protecting him?
- Why aren't you?

31:59.067 --> 32:01.209
- Because... just... just...

32:01.286 --> 32:04.245
Give... Helm, just give me
that thing, Helm!

32:04.322 --> 32:07.027
Just... just... gi...

32:15.417 --> 32:17.643
Bernard, don't.

32:21.381 --> 32:24.307
<i>- Could be him
coming back for us.</i>

32:24.384 --> 32:27.069
<i>- Tell me about my day.
- I love you.</i>

32:27.145 --> 32:29.020
<i>- John, wait!</i>

32:29.097 --> 32:31.189
<i>- There are no mothers here.</i>

32:31.266 --> 32:34.484
<i>No fathers, no sons.
- John, wait!</i>

32:34.561 --> 32:35.997
<i>- to each other here like this.</i>

32:36.021 --> 32:38.082
<i>You think that doesn't
cost me anything.</i>

32:40.709 --> 32:43.293
<i>- John, wait!</i>

32:49.242 --> 32:53.095
- John, I'm... John?

32:55.891 --> 32:57.599
Oh, there you are.

32:57.676 --> 33:00.218
I saw what happened
with the optic.

33:00.295 --> 33:02.479
I tried to get to you, but...

33:05.008 --> 33:06.766
Where's Gary?

33:06.843 --> 33:08.143
- I think he moved on.

33:08.219 --> 33:11.187
- Gammas don't do that.

33:11.264 --> 33:13.448
- You never know with people.

33:16.853 --> 33:18.403
- What is it?

33:18.480 --> 33:21.101
- It just came to me.
Do you like it?

33:21.125 --> 33:26.753
- Well, it's... No,
if I'm being honest.

33:26.830 --> 33:28.505
- You're being honest?

33:34.329 --> 33:37.305
- I crossed a line tonight.

33:38.875 --> 33:41.101
The world didn't end.

33:42.646 --> 33:45.764
- Bernard told me
about your date.

33:45.840 --> 33:48.892
- What?

33:48.968 --> 33:51.486
Oh, right, that.

33:52.347 --> 33:55.532
Yeah, I don't want to talk
about Bernard, John.

33:57.477 --> 33:59.861
I want to...
- Why didn't you tell me?

33:59.938 --> 34:03.740
- Why would I?
It was just... it was nothing.

34:03.817 --> 34:07.669
Just Bernard being...
He wasn't himself.

34:07.746 --> 34:11.456
- Were you?
Were you being yourself?

34:11.533 --> 34:13.208
Lenina Crowne, Beta Plus.

34:13.284 --> 34:17.662
- I don't... Is something...

34:17.739 --> 34:20.965
- Did you have sex with him?
- With Bernard Marx?

34:21.042 --> 34:23.685
Why would you even think...
- Is that not something you do?

34:23.762 --> 34:27.314
I mean...
Or just not with Bernard?

34:30.677 --> 34:32.644
Who was he tonight?
- Who was who?

34:32.720 --> 34:34.646
- Don't do that.

34:34.722 --> 34:37.023
I know where you go,
I know what you do.

34:37.100 --> 34:38.992
You... we both know.
- Yeah.

34:39.069 --> 34:43.154
We... we both know,

34:43.231 --> 34:45.791
and we agreed it doesn't matter.

34:50.697 --> 34:53.081
- You're right.

34:53.158 --> 34:55.917
It doesn't matter.
I'm sorry.

34:55.994 --> 34:59.513
Good.

35:14.512 --> 35:17.447
There are all kinds of prisons,
aren't there?

35:21.227 --> 35:24.988
My level.
My body.

35:25.064 --> 35:27.207
This place.

35:37.035 --> 35:40.031
John.

35:40.055 --> 35:42.389
What would it take to leave?

35:43.917 --> 35:45.925
What will we need?

35:46.002 --> 35:49.749
'Cause out there
it could be our world.

35:49.773 --> 35:52.573
As we make it.

35:56.280 --> 35:59.147
- It's what you did
that matters.

35:59.224 --> 36:01.524
- What?
- With him, tonight.

36:01.601 --> 36:03.429
- Are you listening to me?

36:03.453 --> 36:06.154
- Tell me what you did.

36:08.691 --> 36:10.461
- You said you didn't
want to know.

36:10.485 --> 36:12.243
- I know.
I changed my mind.

36:12.320 --> 36:13.439
I need you to tell me.
Please tell me.

36:13.463 --> 36:14.965
- No.
- Please.

36:14.989 --> 36:16.592
Why?
Why not?

36:16.616 --> 36:20.418
- Because it...
It hurts you, John.

36:20.495 --> 36:22.596
- I want it to hurt.

36:29.888 --> 36:32.814
Tell me everything
you did with him.

36:35.485 --> 36:37.611
Did you take him in your mouth?

36:41.849 --> 36:44.284
- No.
- What did you do?

36:46.330 --> 36:47.904
- I don't know what you want.

36:47.981 --> 36:52.200
- I want the truth.
I want the truth.

36:52.277 --> 36:54.419
- The truth?
- Uh-huh.

36:55.822 --> 36:59.290
- The truth is,
it was a basic Tuesday.

36:59.367 --> 37:02.238
Alphas and Betas.
- Right.

37:02.262 --> 37:05.347
- Frannie took me to a Joy Box.

37:05.423 --> 37:07.799
We connected.
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

37:07.875 --> 37:10.134
That's... you connected?
That's not what you did.

37:10.211 --> 37:13.304
You fucked.

37:13.381 --> 37:15.473
- If you say so.
- No, no, no.

37:15.550 --> 37:18.985
You say it.
I want you to say it.

37:22.348 --> 37:25.024
- We fucked.
I fucked him.

37:25.101 --> 37:27.494
Feel better?

37:28.396 --> 37:30.455
- Yes.
Then?

37:34.402 --> 37:36.286
How'd you do it?
Were you on top?

37:36.362 --> 37:38.579
Was he?

37:38.656 --> 37:41.207
Has it been so many people
that you don't even remember?

37:41.284 --> 37:43.677
- From behind.

37:45.079 --> 37:47.505
At first.

37:47.582 --> 37:50.350
If you must know, rather hard.

37:52.253 --> 37:53.678
- Mm-hmm.

37:53.755 --> 37:55.875
- His teeth on my neck.
- Uh-huh.

37:55.899 --> 37:58.641
- His left hand was on my hip.

37:58.718 --> 38:03.229
His right was trailing up
the inside of... of my thigh.

38:03.306 --> 38:05.907
- Mm.
- Shall I go on?

38:05.984 --> 38:09.193
- No, show me.
Show me what you did.

38:09.270 --> 38:11.391
Do it.

38:11.415 --> 38:14.499
Make my body his.
Make me him.

38:21.074 --> 38:25.343
Laughing at me sitting here,
knowing he's doing this to you.

38:25.420 --> 38:27.128
Did he do this?

38:27.205 --> 38:29.409
- Harder.
Mm.

38:29.433 --> 38:32.342
- Yes.
- Yes.

38:32.418 --> 38:33.896
- Really?
- Harder.

38:33.920 --> 38:35.470
- Did he...
This is what you like?

38:35.546 --> 38:36.615
- Yes.
- Yes?

38:36.639 --> 38:38.639
- Yes, yes.

38:38.716 --> 38:40.850
- Did you come?
Say it.

38:40.927 --> 38:42.602
Did you come?
Or is that just me?

38:42.678 --> 38:44.924
- No, I didn't, I didn't.
- Liar!

38:55.650 --> 38:59.044
I saw you.
I was there.

39:01.989 --> 39:03.581
I was you.

39:03.658 --> 39:05.886
- Please, stop it.
I love you.

39:05.910 --> 39:09.337
- No! You can't.
You can't.

39:09.414 --> 39:12.974
You can't feel this.
Do you see this?

39:13.051 --> 39:16.936
This is love.
This is what it costs.

39:36.941 --> 39:39.626
- You're in prison too.

39:43.665 --> 39:46.999
- Lenina, don't.
Don't... don't leave... Lenina.

39:47.076 --> 39:50.470
Lenina, please.
Please, please.

39:52.516 --> 39:55.892
Don't.
Lenina?

40:03.968 --> 40:06.694
<i>- So the Savage is a killer.</i>

40:07.889 --> 40:11.149
This is it, isn't it?

40:11.225 --> 40:13.526
This is the calamity
that Mond predicted.

40:13.603 --> 40:15.664
- You were right, Henry.
He didn't jump.

40:17.398 --> 40:21.784
We should probably proceed
with caution, don't you think?

40:21.861 --> 40:24.162
- No, I do not think.

40:24.238 --> 40:25.997
Caution?

40:26.073 --> 40:29.167
We need to banish the man
before he kills again.

40:32.079 --> 40:34.639
Yes, all right, then.
He's banished.

40:37.752 --> 40:40.312
Do you think he'll go willingly?

40:41.088 --> 40:43.014
- I do not.

40:43.090 --> 40:45.641
- No. No.

40:45.718 --> 40:48.278
No.

40:48.346 --> 40:49.812
What do you propose?

40:49.889 --> 40:53.441
- I propose you act your level!

40:53.518 --> 40:56.944
You are Henry Foster.
Alpha Plus.

40:57.021 --> 40:59.655
Director of Bureau of Stability.

40:59.732 --> 41:02.742
And the social body demands

41:02.818 --> 41:07.589
that you act to save them
from this Savage.

41:10.243 --> 41:13.803
You're quite right, Marx.

41:18.209 --> 41:20.560
I am the Director.

41:22.380 --> 41:24.814
And as the Director...

41:28.135 --> 41:31.062
I'm instructing you
to deal with this.

41:31.138 --> 41:32.813
Directly.

41:35.243 --> 41:38.402
- Thank you, Director.

41:38.479 --> 41:40.600
Consider it done.

41:56.831 --> 41:58.932
<i>- John, wait!</i>

42:01.627 --> 42:04.624
<i>John, wait!</i>

42:04.648 --> 42:07.148
- He killed the Director.

42:16.558 --> 42:17.867
- John?

42:19.312 --> 42:22.572
John, where are you?
Oh, Gary?

42:22.648 --> 42:25.324
- I waited for you to come back
from that Savage place.

42:25.401 --> 42:27.146
- Frannie, why are you...

42:27.170 --> 42:28.911
- I knew something terrible
had happened...

42:28.988 --> 42:30.413
- Where's John?

42:30.489 --> 42:32.582
- Because I felt it here.

42:34.869 --> 42:38.429
I went to your flat,
I lay in your bed...

42:42.760 --> 42:46.187
Waiting for you to come back.

42:46.264 --> 42:48.931
I'm still waiting.

42:49.008 --> 42:50.836
I thought it was because of me,

42:50.860 --> 42:54.195
that I had hurt you or worse,

42:54.272 --> 42:57.824
that I bored you or...

43:01.187 --> 43:05.031
But it's not me.
It's you.

43:05.107 --> 43:08.034
And it's him.
He's infected you with his...

43:08.110 --> 43:10.878
- No, you don't understand.
- You're a Savage now.

43:12.882 --> 43:16.792
And I need to save you.
I can't let them banish you.

43:16.869 --> 43:20.796
- I save myself.
- I... I... I just...

43:20.873 --> 43:23.202
Reconditioning isn't the end.
- You stay away.

43:23.226 --> 43:26.427
- I'll be there with you,
like always.

43:26.504 --> 43:29.709
He's just pain.
Look at you.

43:29.733 --> 43:32.066
Look what he's done to you.

43:33.386 --> 43:36.716
You... come with me... -

43:36.740 --> 43:38.230
- The conditioners will make you

43:38.307 --> 43:39.660
remember who you're
supposed to be.

43:39.684 --> 43:42.860
- I'm supposed to be
someone else.

43:42.937 --> 43:45.404
- You don't mean that.

44:01.539 --> 44:04.057
<i>- There's the Savage.
- There he is!</i>

44:42.913 --> 44:45.014
Hey, guys.

44:56.135 --> 44:58.469
- Stand aside.

45:02.308 --> 45:04.325
- What are you doing down here?

45:08.522 --> 45:11.741
I'm here to help you, John,
as always.

45:11.817 --> 45:14.335
It's time to go.

45:14.412 --> 45:15.736
- Where?

45:15.813 --> 45:17.382
- Somewhere new
where you can't harm anyone.

45:17.406 --> 45:19.924
- It wasn't my fault.
- What wasn't?

45:21.043 --> 45:25.337
You destroy everything, John.
And it's not your conditioning.

45:25.414 --> 45:29.341
It's your nature.
The Director.

45:29.418 --> 45:30.904
The people at
the monogamy ceremony.

45:30.928 --> 45:32.331
- Your mother...
- Watch yourself.

45:32.355 --> 45:34.972
- Lenina Crowne.
What will happen to her now?

45:35.049 --> 45:38.017
Hmm?
Banishment?

45:38.093 --> 45:40.269
Reconditioning?
- She doesn't belong to you.

45:40.346 --> 45:43.281
- All you had to do
was be happy.

45:45.869 --> 45:48.736
It's my own fault.
I was your friend.

45:51.232 --> 45:54.917
But a Savage is a Savage.

45:57.046 --> 45:59.121
You can't change
the nature of a thing...

45:59.198 --> 46:01.235
- The only difference
between me and you

46:01.259 --> 46:02.958
is a letter over your head.

46:03.035 --> 46:05.544
- The difference is
you are a killer.

46:05.621 --> 46:08.868
- You're a killer too.
You just don't know it yet.

46:11.269 --> 46:14.687
Take him.

46:21.804 --> 46:24.071
I gave you an order.

46:27.810 --> 46:31.078
- John.
Come.

46:31.155 --> 46:33.405
- What are you doing?

46:37.319 --> 46:40.213
W-What are you gonna do, John?

46:43.092 --> 46:45.218
There's nowhere else to go!

47:51.944 --> 47:54.987
Hey.

47:55.064 --> 47:57.624
You Jacks.
You missed a spot.

47:58.984 --> 48:01.355
Did you hear what I said?

48:01.379 --> 48:02.995
Hey!

48:03.072 --> 48:04.630
I'm talking to you!

48:10.388 --> 48:13.297
Do you know who I am?
