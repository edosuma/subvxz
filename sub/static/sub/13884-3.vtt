01:22.704 --> 01:24.740
<i>Oh, pardon me...</i>

01:28.904 --> 01:30.496
Oh! Oh, n...! Urgh!

01:55.744 --> 01:59.817
Not too little and not too much. That's important...

02:05.904 --> 02:07.701
Here we go!

02:07.864 --> 02:11.413
I'll just give your quarters
a quick tickle around, sir.

02:11.584 --> 02:14.018
- Won't take a jiff.
- Not now. I'm cooking.

02:23.184 --> 02:25.937
- I didn't know you could do that!
- Oh, yes.

02:26.104 --> 02:28.299
I have add-ons for my groinal socket

02:28.464 --> 02:32.457
which allow me to perform virtually
any household task imaginable.

02:32.904 --> 02:34.895
- Like what?
- Oh, you name it,

02:35.064 --> 02:37.897
buzz-saw, drill, hedge trimmer...
even an egg whisk.

02:38.864 --> 02:42.937
So, you stick the egg whisk on
and you can whip up an omelette?

02:43.144 --> 02:47.183
I can, but it's amazing how
few people are prepared to eat them.

02:53.304 --> 02:56.455
Goodness me!
I must have sucked up a penny.

02:58.424 --> 03:02.542
I better change the old bag.
Yes, I'll just get a fresh one.

03:03.544 --> 03:07.378
Mmm! Something smells good! What is it?

03:07.544 --> 03:10.741
It's me! I love this aftershave!

03:11.584 --> 03:15.020
You are minutes away
from the greatest meal of your life.

03:15.184 --> 03:17.493
Set your taste buds on Def Con 3!

03:18.144 --> 03:20.499
Hey, where'd you get all this stuff?

03:20.704 --> 03:24.299
I got sick of plastic cutlery,
so I went to the medical unit.

03:24.504 --> 03:26.256
This is a scalpel!

03:27.224 --> 03:30.773
I'm supposed to use something
that's been inside someone's guts?

03:30.984 --> 03:33.498
It's all been washed. It's clean.

03:34.144 --> 03:38.899
Something that once may have performed
a certain popular Jewish operation?

03:39.904 --> 03:42.099
I'm supposed to eat with this?

03:42.264 --> 03:45.495
Get the onion salads out of the fridge.

03:46.224 --> 03:48.260
"Embryo Refrigeration Unit"?!

03:48.424 --> 03:52.178
How many times...? It's clean! It's been cleaned!

03:53.304 --> 03:56.296
- Onion salads...
- They're in the kidney bowls,

03:56.464 --> 04:00.457
next to the colostomy bag
with the chilli sauce in it.

04:01.904 --> 04:05.180
Here we go! Here we go!

04:22.024 --> 04:23.423
Yahoo!

04:23.584 --> 04:27.020
Come on, man. Come on.
It's ready. Sit down. sit down.

04:27.184 --> 04:30.494
One kebab for you and one kebab for me.

04:32.464 --> 04:34.341
Lemon juice?

04:35.904 --> 04:39.374
- What the hell is that?
- It's a syringe.

04:39.544 --> 04:42.183
- What kind of syringe?
- It's for cows.

04:42.344 --> 04:45.256
Artificial insemination. It's been washed.

04:45.424 --> 04:48.097
It's all been sterilised. Do you want some?

04:49.584 --> 04:52.257
- Excuse me.
- What about the meal?

04:53.104 --> 04:55.379
This isn't a meal, it's an autopsy!

04:55.544 --> 04:59.776
- What about the main course?
- You think I got nothing else to do

04:59.944 --> 05:03.459
than watch you serve
chicken chasseur in a stool bucket?

05:03.664 --> 05:06.053
Charming! I don't know.

05:06.224 --> 05:09.455
You pull out all the stops, you make an effort...

05:10.464 --> 05:13.297
try and do something with a bit of class,

05:13.464 --> 05:15.853
and where does it get you?

05:17.064 --> 05:19.259
Mmm, very cheeky.

05:39.824 --> 05:42.179
Oh, I'm sorry to interrupt, sir.

05:42.344 --> 05:44.574
I just need to get a... Sorry.

05:44.784 --> 05:48.982
Oh, no, Kryten. It's all right.
Just running a few old home movies.

05:50.544 --> 05:54.537
That's me, there. Those are my brothers -
John, Frank and Howard.

05:54.704 --> 05:56.695
God, we were close.

05:56.864 --> 05:59.253
The Four Musketeers, we used to call ourselves.

05:59.424 --> 06:03.781
Well, the Three Musketeers, actually.
I was always the Queen of Spain.

06:03.944 --> 06:08.176
Marvellous. Yes, I was the butt
of the occasional practical joke,

06:08.384 --> 06:10.773
but I mean, er...nothing sinister.

06:15.784 --> 06:18.252
Just the usual boyhood pranks, you know -

06:18.424 --> 06:22.019
apple-pie beds and black-eye telescopes...

06:22.184 --> 06:26.496
One time, they even hid
a small landmine in my sandpit.

06:26.664 --> 06:29.224
They took it from my father's gun cabinet.

06:29.384 --> 06:31.944
How did they know it would go off?

06:32.104 --> 06:35.221
- Marvellous guys.
- Oh, who's that?

06:35.384 --> 06:37.454
- An old girlfriend, sir?
- Hardly.

06:37.664 --> 06:41.179
No, not really your type. Silly old trout like that.

06:42.064 --> 06:47.457
- She's my mother.
- Oh! Oh! I am so sorry, sir...

06:47.624 --> 06:50.855
- Just forget it.
- Oh, how can I forget it, sir?

06:51.024 --> 06:54.937
I compared your mother
to a foolish, aged, blubbery fish.

06:55.104 --> 06:59.416
I said she was
a simple-minded, scaly old piscine.

06:59.584 --> 07:03.213
I intimated she was an ugly,
lungless marine animal

07:03.384 --> 07:05.375
with galloping senility,

07:05.544 --> 07:10.743
a putrid amphibious gill-breather
with less brains than a mollusc.

07:11.424 --> 07:13.415
Forget it!

07:14.144 --> 07:17.136
Ah. Freeze.
Ah, there she is. Magnificent woman.

07:17.344 --> 07:20.620
Very prim, very proper. Some say austere.

07:20.784 --> 07:23.173
Some took her for cold, aloof.

07:23.344 --> 07:28.099
Not a bit of it, she just despised idiots,
no time for fools.

07:28.264 --> 07:31.062
Tragic, really,
otherwise we would have got on famously.

07:32.064 --> 07:36.615
Well, if you'll excuse me, sir.
This is a private family moment.

07:36.784 --> 07:39.617
I've no fish to embarrass you further.

07:39.784 --> 07:41.979
I'll let myself trout.

07:42.224 --> 07:45.022
- Oh, sir, I'm...
- Just go!

07:47.544 --> 07:51.742
Don't panic, Arn, but it does appear
there's a very tiny possibility

07:51.904 --> 07:55.817
that there may very well be
a non-human life form on board.

07:56.024 --> 07:59.141
You mean like last time,
when we got all worked up

07:59.304 --> 08:02.614
and went scooting off,
complete with bazookoids and backpacks,

08:02.784 --> 08:04.775
and it was one of Lister's socks?

08:05.544 --> 08:07.614
I didn't recognise the genetic structure.

08:07.784 --> 08:10.378
Biologically speaking,
they were a completely new life form.

08:11.304 --> 08:14.296
Absolutely ridiculous. I felt a total goit.

08:14.504 --> 08:16.734
-Take a butchers'.
- Where is it?

08:16.944 --> 08:20.414
I lost it. It's somewhere
along the habitation decks.

08:20.624 --> 08:23.184
Can't get a moment's peace!

08:25.784 --> 08:28.821
- Enjoying your meal, sir?
- It's de-smegging-licious, Kryten.

08:28.984 --> 08:31.054
It's my own recipe, you know?

08:31.224 --> 08:35.263
Shami Kebab Diablo. It's beautiful.
It's like eating molten lava.

08:35.904 --> 08:40.500
I cooked up one for Petersen once.
He was in sick bay for a week.

08:44.904 --> 08:47.099
- What?
- I didn't say anything, sir.

08:54.664 --> 08:57.781
- You like them that hot?
- It's trying to kill me.

08:57.984 --> 09:00.179
Oh, it's a good one, huh?

09:01.704 --> 09:05.060
- It went under here.
- Are you all right, sir?

09:05.264 --> 09:06.820
It's gone.

09:06.984 --> 09:10.579
- What?
- How? Where could it go?

09:10.744 --> 09:13.941
We better go, Kryten.
Something very weird is going on.

09:14.104 --> 09:17.460
Something very, very... Ooh!
Sudden pain in my groin.

09:19.744 --> 09:22.133
- What's wrong?
- Ah! My underpants!

09:22.344 --> 09:26.098
They're shrinking. Oh, God!
Me boxers are alive, man!

09:26.304 --> 09:29.933
They're getting smaller! Help me, please!

09:30.144 --> 09:32.135
Please, I'm begging you!

09:35.544 --> 09:37.535
Get 'em off!

09:38.304 --> 09:40.943
- Pull them down!
- Keep still!

09:48.304 --> 09:51.694
Well, I can't say I'm totally shocked.

09:51.864 --> 09:54.253
You'll bonk anything, won't you, Lister?

09:54.464 --> 09:57.456
- The boxers, where are they?
- I put them here.

09:57.624 --> 09:59.615
- You sure?
- There's nothing here.

09:59.784 --> 10:01.900
Just the blanket and the...

10:02.104 --> 10:03.503
Snake!

10:03.704 --> 10:06.980
- Snake!
- Kryten!

10:08.024 --> 10:11.778
- What the smeg is going on?!
- I hate snakes.

10:11.944 --> 10:14.412
They freak me out totally, snakes.

10:14.584 --> 10:17.940
They are my all-time second-worst fear, guy.

10:18.104 --> 10:20.334
What's your first?

10:23.464 --> 10:25.261
This.

10:32.704 --> 10:34.376
Is he OK?

10:34.864 --> 10:37.936
- As far as we can tell, yes.
- Where'd it go?

10:38.144 --> 10:42.456
It turned into a squelchy thing
and squidged off down the corridor.

10:42.664 --> 10:47.055
- What is it? Some kind of alien?
- No, it's from Earth, man-made.

10:47.224 --> 10:51.137
I checked its DNA profile.
A genetic experiment that went wrong.

10:51.344 --> 10:55.337
Apparently, it was an attempt
to create the ultimate warrior,

10:55.504 --> 10:58.974
a mutant that changes shape
to deceive its enemies.

10:59.184 --> 11:02.142
- So what did go wrong?
- It's insane!

11:02.344 --> 11:04.733
It feeds off the negative emotions -

11:04.904 --> 11:08.817
fear, guilt, anger, paranoia,
drains them out of its prey.

11:09.024 --> 11:11.413
It's a sort of emotional vampire.

11:11.584 --> 11:13.973
It changes shape
to provoke a negative emotion.

11:14.144 --> 11:19.502
It took Lister to the limit
of his terror, then sucked out his fear.

11:19.704 --> 11:22.696
- So now Lister's got no fear?
- Precisely.

11:22.864 --> 11:26.618
- What are we going to do?
- I say let's go and twat it.

11:29.664 --> 11:32.178
Lister, you're ill. Leave this to us.

11:33.184 --> 11:36.574
I could have had it, but it took me by surprise.

11:37.664 --> 11:41.179
Lister, it turned into an 8ft-tall
armour-plated alien killing machine.

11:41.384 --> 11:43.693
If it wants a barney, it'll get one.

11:43.864 --> 11:47.379
One knee in the happy sacks,
it'll drop like anyone else.

11:48.184 --> 11:50.493
Fine. We'll bear that in mind.

11:50.704 --> 11:54.014
I'm gonna beat it to death with its own tonsils.

11:54.184 --> 11:55.981
Yes, yes. Very good.

11:56.144 --> 11:58.578
I'll stick my fist so far down its gob,

11:58.744 --> 12:02.657
- I can pull the label off its pants.
- Yes, yes. Kryten...

12:05.144 --> 12:07.135
What's that? You starting trouble?

12:07.344 --> 12:10.222
It's just something to calm you down, sir.

12:10.424 --> 12:13.143
Come on, then. All of you slags!

12:13.304 --> 12:17.695
All together or one at a time.
It's all the same to me. I'm...

12:19.544 --> 12:23.696
Thank God for that.
Right, we have two options -

12:23.864 --> 12:27.903
one - we take it on and kill it,
or two - run away.

12:28.064 --> 12:31.500
- Who's for two?
- Two sounds good to me, sir.

12:31.704 --> 12:33.695
It's always been my lucky number.

12:33.864 --> 12:36.617
- Right, let's load up Starbug.
- What about Lister?

12:36.824 --> 12:40.612
Seal the hatch from the inside.
He'll be safe until we go.

12:40.824 --> 12:44.419
- Remember, it could be anything.
- Let's move it.

12:44.624 --> 12:49.459
What about the Space Corps directive
which states that our primary duty

12:49.624 --> 12:54.061
is to contact other life forms
and bring them home?

12:54.584 --> 12:58.293
What about the Rimmer directive,
which states, "Never tackle anything

12:58.464 --> 13:02.173
"that's got more teeth
than the entire Osmond family"?

13:13.904 --> 13:15.701
It's here.

13:16.424 --> 13:19.018
- Where?
- Somewhere.

13:19.784 --> 13:22.173
Set the bazookoids to heat-seeker.

13:23.704 --> 13:26.343
When you see it, aim roughly in its direction,

13:26.504 --> 13:29.701
and the heat-seekers will do the rest.

13:42.984 --> 13:47.102
In the shadows...
It's in the shadows! There! There! There!

13:50.544 --> 13:53.104
Sorry. My fault. False alarm.

13:54.864 --> 13:56.661
Idiot.

14:03.184 --> 14:07.336
I don't understand, holograms
don't produce heat. Neither do androids.

14:07.504 --> 14:09.813
What are they homing in on?

14:11.904 --> 14:13.940
So long, guys.

14:49.144 --> 14:51.294
Oh, come on! Give me a break!

15:01.544 --> 15:05.981
You either got it or you ain't,
and, boys, you ain't even close.

15:07.064 --> 15:09.055
Cat, where are you?

15:09.224 --> 15:12.978
- Over here.
- Stay put, we'll come and find you.

15:13.144 --> 15:15.260
Keep talking.

15:25.744 --> 15:28.338
What are you looking for?

15:28.504 --> 15:31.223
A mutant. It's dangerous.
It can turn into anything.

15:31.424 --> 15:33.460
Oh, sounds pretty scary.

15:33.624 --> 15:35.615
It is, baby. Believe me.

15:36.904 --> 15:41.580
It must take a really brave sort
of guy to do this kind of work.

15:41.744 --> 15:45.498
- Well, I guess you're right.
- And I bet you have to be smart.

15:45.664 --> 15:48.337
Smart? Yeah,
you definitely have to be smart.

15:48.504 --> 15:52.543
It can turn into anything.
You gotta have your wits about you.

15:52.704 --> 15:57.539
Don't let up for one second,
or - blip! - you're dog meat.

15:57.704 --> 16:02.619
- Come on, babe.
- You know, you're quite a guy,

16:02.784 --> 16:07.255
- Brave, smart, handsome...
- Oh, you think handsome?

16:07.464 --> 16:11.980
Oh, come on. You're probably
the best-looking guy I've ever seen.

16:12.184 --> 16:17.178
- I wasn't going to be first to say.
- Do you know what I'd really like?

16:17.344 --> 16:19.778
To make love to a guy like you.

16:22.144 --> 16:25.898
Well, I'm sure I have a window
in my schedule somewhere.

16:26.064 --> 16:30.455
Let's see... What are you doing in,
say, ten seconds time?

16:30.624 --> 16:35.493
- Nothing I couldn't cancel.
- Hi. I'm the Cat.

16:35.704 --> 16:38.741
Hi. I'm the genetic mutant.

16:38.944 --> 16:42.380
Glad to know you. Jenny who?

16:48.864 --> 16:50.263
It's got him!

16:50.984 --> 16:54.420
Oh! Oh, my goodness! Are you all right?

16:55.264 --> 16:57.380
- Is he dead?
- Unconscious,

16:57.544 --> 17:00.297
but, according to the psi-scan,
he's lost an emotion.

17:00.504 --> 17:02.654
- Which emotion?
- He's lost his vanity.

17:02.864 --> 17:05.821
- This is your fault, Kryten.
- M-M-My fault?

17:06.023 --> 17:08.140
We were supposed to stick together.

17:08.344 --> 17:11.858
- But it wasn't...
- He trusted you. Now look at him.

17:12.064 --> 17:14.896
- Oh, please. I feel so...
- Guilty?

17:15.064 --> 17:18.579
- Yes.
- Good!

17:28.304 --> 17:29.862
Hah!

17:33.384 --> 17:34.783
Shoo! Shoo!

17:41.544 --> 17:46.379
- Let's get out of here.
- It's got my guilt, the one emotion

17:46.544 --> 17:50.935
which prevents my transgressing
the mores of civilised society.

17:51.144 --> 17:53.783
Stop your blithering, Kryten. Let's go.

17:53.984 --> 17:56.100
Oh, screw you, hadron-head!

18:04.744 --> 18:06.939
Where have you been? Let's go!

18:07.104 --> 18:10.096
I was getting myself comfortable, man.

18:11.944 --> 18:15.493
- Come on, Kryten. You're holding us all up.
- Who cares?

18:15.664 --> 18:18.178
- You'll get us all killed.
- So?

18:28.424 --> 18:31.734
Oh, look. It's Bonehead's mum.

18:32.944 --> 18:34.980
- Mother?
- Hello, dear.

18:35.184 --> 18:38.938
- What are you doing?
- What does it look like, darling?

18:39.144 --> 18:42.375
- You made love to my mother?
- Yeah. What of it?

18:42.664 --> 18:46.498
- It's the polymorph!
- You've just had my mum?!

18:46.704 --> 18:50.458
Five times. He was like a wild stallion.

18:51.584 --> 18:55.372
"Very prim, very proper. Almost austere."

18:56.224 --> 18:58.454
It's trying to make you angry.

18:58.664 --> 19:01.497
Darling, I wish
you could have seen him in action.

19:01.664 --> 19:05.782
He was like a set of pistons
in an ocean liner engine room.

19:05.944 --> 19:07.935
I think I'm going to be sick.

19:08.144 --> 19:11.534
- Don't get angry.
- Lister and mother...

19:11.704 --> 19:13.854
it's a dream come true.

19:14.024 --> 19:16.094
He's so energetic.

19:16.264 --> 19:20.223
I honestly thought
my false teeth were going to fall out.

19:20.384 --> 19:23.740
- Lovely.
- The positions he bent me into!

19:23.904 --> 19:27.135
Terrific. That sounds enchanting. Well done.

19:27.304 --> 19:31.900
And the things this boy can do
with Alphabetti Spaghetti.

19:32.064 --> 19:36.455
- Cool it, Arnie.
- ALPHABETTI SPAGHETTI?!

19:52.944 --> 19:56.254
- Where is it now?
- It's gone back to the cargo bays,

19:56.424 --> 20:01.134
sleeping off a four-course meal
of fear, vanity, guilt and anger.

20:03.624 --> 20:07.139
Just because it's an armour-plated
alien killing machine

20:07.304 --> 20:09.818
that salivates unspeakable slobber,

20:09.984 --> 20:12.418
doesn't mean it's a bad person.

20:12.584 --> 20:17.339
We need to put together a solution package
over tea and biscuits.

20:17.544 --> 20:19.933
Look at him. You can't trust his opinion.

20:20.104 --> 20:22.095
He's got no anger. He's a total dork.

20:22.304 --> 20:26.422
Good point, Kryten.
Let's take that on board, shall we?

20:26.584 --> 20:29.257
David? Do you have anything to say?

20:30.744 --> 20:32.894
Well, yes. I have, actually, Arnold.

20:33.064 --> 20:35.339
Let's go to the ammunition stores,

20:35.504 --> 20:39.099
get the nuclear warheads
and then strap one to my head.

20:39.264 --> 20:41.459
I'll nut the smegger to oblivion.

20:42.264 --> 20:46.701
Right, well, that's nice, David.
Let's put that on the back burner.

20:46.864 --> 20:49.298
Cat, let's have your contribution. Come on.

20:49.464 --> 20:52.820
Hey, don't ask me, I'm nobody.
Just pretend I'm not here.

20:53.024 --> 20:57.575
That's lovely. Thank you very much.
Moving on a step...

20:57.784 --> 21:01.459
and don't think
that I'm setting myself up as chairperson.

21:01.624 --> 21:05.583
Just see me as a facilitator.
Kryten, what's your view?

21:05.744 --> 21:08.304
Well, we should send Lister in as a decoy,

21:08.464 --> 21:10.455
and while it's eating him alive,

21:10.624 --> 21:13.661
we could blast it into the stratosphere.

21:14.304 --> 21:17.580
Good plan. That's the best plan yet.

21:17.744 --> 21:19.974
Let it get knackered eating me to death,

21:20.224 --> 21:22.215
then you guys, like, catch it unawares.

21:22.864 --> 21:25.173
Well, that's certainly an option, David, yes.

21:25.344 --> 21:29.542
Um, but here's my proposal. Let's get tough.

21:29.704 --> 21:31.934
The time for talking is over.

21:32.104 --> 21:36.382
Call it extreme, but I propose
we hit it hard and hit it fast

21:36.544 --> 21:41.459
with a major,
and I mean major, leaflet campaign.

21:41.624 --> 21:45.742
And while it's reeling from that,
we follow up with a whist drive,

21:45.904 --> 21:48.464
a car-boot sale, some street theatre

21:48.624 --> 21:51.092
and possibly even some benefit concerts. OK?

21:51.264 --> 21:55.382
Now, if that's not enough,
I'm sorry, it's time for the T-shirts.

21:55.544 --> 22:00.902
"Mutants Out."
"Chameleonic Life Forms? No, Thanks."

22:01.064 --> 22:03.339
If that's not enough, what is?

22:03.544 --> 22:07.935
Has anyone ever told you that
you are a disgusting pus-filled bubo

22:08.104 --> 22:10.572
who has all the wit, charm and self-possession

22:10.744 --> 22:13.417
of an Alsatian dog
after a head-swap operation?

22:15.064 --> 22:18.943
Listen, you bunch of tarts, it's clobbering time!

22:19.104 --> 22:22.460
There's a body bag
with that scud-ball's name on it.

22:22.624 --> 22:27.140
I'm doing up the zip. Anyone
who gets in my way gets a napalm enema.

22:28.224 --> 22:33.218
I think everybody's right,
except me, so just forget I spoke.

22:33.424 --> 22:38.134
Um, I think we're all beginning
to lose sight of the real issue here,

22:38.304 --> 22:41.216
which is what are we going to call ourselves?

22:41.384 --> 22:46.504
I think it's a choice between
the League Against Salivating Monsters

22:46.664 --> 22:48.894
or my own personal preference,

22:49.064 --> 22:52.613
the Committee for the Liberation
and Integration of Terrifying Organisms

22:52.784 --> 22:55.776
and their Rehabilitation into Society.

22:55.944 --> 22:59.334
Erm, one drawback with that,
the abbreviation is CLITORIS.

23:03.184 --> 23:05.175
Look, it needs killing!

23:05.344 --> 23:10.464
If that means I sacrifice my life
in some pointless way, all the better.

23:10.664 --> 23:13.462
Yes. Even if it doesn't work, it'll be a laugh.

23:14.424 --> 23:18.337
Right, so let's just cut all
of this business and get on with it.

23:18.504 --> 23:21.621
Last one alive's a wet ponce. Who's with me?

23:21.824 --> 23:24.463
Well, the car stickers aren't ready till Thursday,

23:24.624 --> 23:27.775
but sometimes
one just has to act spontaneously.

23:27.944 --> 23:30.253
- People, let's go.
- I'm coming, too.

23:30.424 --> 23:32.494
Maybe I can bum some money.

23:32.664 --> 23:37.454
Maybe if I hand you guys over,
it'll let me go. Move it, suckers!

24:10.184 --> 24:12.254
# Love everybody

24:12.424 --> 24:14.415
# All you need is love... #

24:14.584 --> 24:16.575
Come on, you chicken!

24:16.744 --> 24:20.134
Show us your slobbery chops
and we'll blow them off.

24:22.264 --> 24:25.461
Here they are, nice juicy humans.
Come and get them.

24:25.624 --> 24:28.092
Here, mutie-mutant!

24:50.104 --> 24:52.743
Phewee! What am I wearing?

24:52.944 --> 24:55.663
Oh, how can you ever forgive me, sirs?

24:55.824 --> 24:58.099
Naturally, I will commit suicide immediately.

24:58.264 --> 25:01.461
Hey, we were all a bit whacked out there.

25:01.624 --> 25:04.377
- You can say that again.
- Come on, let's clean up.

25:04.544 --> 25:06.739
If I don't get into evening wear,

25:06.904 --> 25:12.024
I'm going to have to resign my post
as Most Handsome Guy on the Ship.
