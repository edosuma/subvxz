and once a year,
we get together for a reunion

27:32.080 --> 27:33.920
and here we are!

27:35.280 --> 27:37.840
We would love to take your tour.

27:37.920 --> 27:39.440
- [man] Yeah.
- What tour?

27:39.520 --> 27:42.000
The tour. The Viking tour.
Well, yes. On your bus.

27:42.080 --> 27:45.240
- Oh, this tour. The bus tour.
- Yes!

27:45.320 --> 27:48.600
No, I'm sorry, there's no tour.

27:48.680 --> 27:51.120
- It's full, it's full. Sorry.
- [man] Full?

27:51.200 --> 27:54.840
- Yeah.
- Full? But the bus is empty.

27:54.920 --> 27:56.480
[in Norwegian]
Don't start a fucking discussion.

27:56.560 --> 27:59.400
The security guys are beginning
to pay attention to us.

27:59.480 --> 28:01.480
[in English]
Of course. Just kidding.

28:01.560 --> 28:03.960
- Yeah?
- Just a Norwegian joke.

28:04.040 --> 28:06.640
[woman laughs]

28:06.720 --> 28:08.320
[man]
Excellent!

28:08.400 --> 28:09.880
This is gonna be great!

28:09.960 --> 28:12.720
[woman]
This is gonna be great!

28:17.640 --> 28:20.680
Actually, on the roof
of this building right here

28:20.760 --> 28:25.480
the famous Norwegian composer
Ole Bull used to sit and play his fiddle.

28:25.560 --> 28:27.160
[man]
Oh, my gosh!

28:27.240 --> 28:29.920
All this Scandinavian history
right here in the Village?

28:30.000 --> 28:32.840
Yes, it's really quite fascinating.

28:32.920 --> 28:37.840
It's also where the idea
for the  Fiddler on the Roof,  uh, was...

28:37.920 --> 28:39.320
Yeah.

28:39.400 --> 28:41.720
But I thought
Fiddler on the Roof  was Jewish.

28:41.800 --> 28:45.040
No. No,  Fiddler on the Roof,
it's, uh, Norwegian, yeah.

28:45.120 --> 28:47.440
A Jew might have written it, yes,

28:47.520 --> 28:50.920
but inspiration came from Ole Bull.

28:51.000 --> 28:54.600
The Jew probably saw Ole
on the roof every night

28:54.680 --> 28:56.840
and said, "Hey, whoa,
there's a fiddler on the roof!"

28:56.920 --> 29:01.920
Then he wrote a play about it,
and, well, you know, the rest is history.

29:02.000 --> 29:04.440
Well, don't you know!

29:04.520 --> 29:06.200
That's good to know.

29:18.600 --> 29:21.400
I don't know what to do.

29:21.480 --> 29:26.000
I can't stand another day,
but if I leave, he will kill me.

29:29.200 --> 29:32.880
Sounds like you could use
a little divine intervention, my child.

29:32.960 --> 29:36.480
I know I should not have
such thoughts, but...

29:38.600 --> 29:42.280
I wish that evil man
got struck by lightning.

29:45.640 --> 29:47.960
Maybe that could be arranged.

29:51.440 --> 29:56.280
Wow, you really are
a full-service church here, Father.

29:57.440 --> 30:01.680
The Lord...
How can I put it?

30:01.760 --> 30:04.320
He works in mysterious ways.

30:04.400 --> 30:06.120
I'm all ears.

30:06.200 --> 30:08.720
Tell me your plan.

30:08.800 --> 30:12.720
Bong Bong, meet Angelina.

30:12.800 --> 30:14.240
Let's talk.

30:20.400 --> 30:25.520
Oh, that was such a good tour.
Bye-bye!

30:27.960 --> 30:31.440
The houseboy will get us in through
the service entrance in the restaurant.

30:31.520 --> 30:34.760
In the basement there's an elevator
that'll take us up to Aldo's apartment.

30:34.840 --> 30:36.800
Okay.

30:36.880 --> 30:38.560
Are the guards taking any time-outs?

30:38.640 --> 30:41.280
No, they-- I can't believe
the bladder on this guy.

30:41.360 --> 30:42.640
They never go to the toilet.

30:42.720 --> 30:46.640
How the fuck are we supposed to get Frank
and Tony in without being recognized?

30:46.720 --> 30:50.120
- [in Norwegian] Good-bye!
- Good-bye!

30:54.560 --> 30:56.240
[in English] I got an idea.

30:58.200 --> 31:03.200
Not a word, not a smirk, not a snicker.

31:03.280 --> 31:05.800
Or that candelabra goes up your ass.

31:05.880 --> 31:07.800
[in Norwegian]
The people in the Seamans church

31:07.880 --> 31:09.760
who lent us these things were really nice.

31:09.840 --> 31:11.440
[in English]
So cheer up, man.

31:13.440 --> 31:15.240
Is this really necessary?

31:15.320 --> 31:18.920
[in Norwegian] It's the only way
to get you into the building.

31:19.000 --> 31:23.280
If Aldo's guards see you... [chuckles]

31:23.360 --> 31:28.040
they will kill you on the spot.

31:28.120 --> 31:30.000
[in English]
I'm thinking right now,

31:30.080 --> 31:33.800
violent death may be
the preferable, dignified option.

31:36.080 --> 31:37.960
Yeah.

31:38.040 --> 31:39.800
Love the hat.

31:46.120 --> 31:48.280
Oh, these costumes are so cute.

31:48.360 --> 31:49.880
Do you always dress this way
in Denmark?

31:49.960 --> 31:52.200
Oh, no, it's Norway,

31:52.280 --> 31:56.240
and only when
they can get away with it.

31:56.320 --> 31:57.560
All right, now, listen.

31:57.640 --> 32:00.840
Those Norwegians from Minnesota,
they're going to be joining us, see?

32:00.920 --> 32:02.560
Torgeir told them
it's the king's birthday.

32:02.640 --> 32:06.160
Aldo's people will never suspect a thing.

32:06.240 --> 32:08.760
Not a bunch of Norskis having a feast.

32:08.840 --> 32:11.560
[Johnny]
We'll be slipping out.

32:11.640 --> 32:13.440
We shouldn't be missed,

32:13.520 --> 32:16.160
but just in case we are,
keep them distracted.

32:16.240 --> 32:20.160
[woman] It's beauti--
Oh, it's beautiful!

32:20.240 --> 32:23.040
Oh, my gosh!

32:24.640 --> 32:26.800
[playing opening theme song]

32:54.440 --> 32:56.960
Okay, now from here on,

32:57.040 --> 32:59.880
hopefully, you won't have to speak.

32:59.960 --> 33:02.520
But just in case, uh,

33:02.600 --> 33:05.280
let's go through what we practiced
one more time, all right?

33:07.160 --> 33:08.840
Who the fuck are you looking at?

33:38.480 --> 33:41.920
Fuck. Am I--?
Are you? Who the fuck are you?

33:43.640 --> 33:46.800
It's okay. It's okay, Roar.
You'll...

33:46.880 --> 33:48.920
- You'll just nod a lot, eh?
- Okay.

33:49.000 --> 33:50.240
- Got it?
- Yeah, okay, boss.

33:50.320 --> 33:51.880
Yeah.

33:57.520 --> 33:59.080
Yes, we must move quickly.

33:59.160 --> 34:01.840
In 20 minutes, he'll be higher
than Charlie Sheen.

34:01.920 --> 34:03.880
All right.
Oh, good, you got the costumes.

34:03.960 --> 34:06.840
Yes, all the same, as you asked.
So boring.

34:06.920 --> 34:08.640
Yeah, yeah. Come on.

34:23.480 --> 34:27.000
Okay. Now, don't forget,
be very spread out.

34:27.080 --> 34:29.800
I'll meet you on the roof
in ten minutes.

42:51.760 --> 42:54.240
- No, you did it.
- No, no, no.

42:54.320 --> 42:56.440

42:56.520 --> 42:58.080
No, we couldn't.

You're from Lilyhammer.
