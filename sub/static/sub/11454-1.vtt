01:12.073 --> 01:14.742
The Jaturungkabart

01:14.742 --> 01:17.828
were sworn to protect
the mighty royal elephants.

01:17.828 --> 01:19.330
Why?

01:19.330 --> 01:21.957
Elephants are so big,
who could hurt them?

01:21.957 --> 01:24.794
The king sits on top of them.

01:24.794 --> 01:27.421
So they must beware
of things from below.

01:27.421 --> 01:29.465
Beware of what, Dad?

01:29.465 --> 01:34.470
If they lost their swords,
they would use their bodies as weapons.

01:34.470 --> 01:38.349
Throw, crush, grab and break.

01:38.349 --> 01:40.434
What do they need
to be careful of?

01:40.434 --> 01:42.061
I cannot tell you yet.

01:42.061 --> 01:46.148
But I'm going to be a Jaturungkabart.
I have to know.

01:47.900 --> 01:49.735
Not yet, Kham.

01:49.735 --> 01:51.987
One day you will know.

02:41.829 --> 02:43.080
Hello.

02:43.080 --> 02:44.874
- Hello.
- Hello.

03:01.307 --> 03:03.392
Splash him, son.
Splash him.

03:04.560 --> 03:06.103
Come on, splash him.
Splash him all over, son.

03:07.313 --> 03:08.397
Splash him, son.
Splash him.

03:08.397 --> 03:09.607
How do you feel, Por Yai?

03:11.650 --> 03:13.736
Por Yai, you're so naughty!
Dad, look at him.

03:13.736 --> 03:15.821
How was it?
Was Por Yai up to his old tricks again?

03:16.697 --> 03:19.450
Why did Por Yai do that to you?

03:21.160 --> 03:23.829
Oh! Splash him, come on.

03:38.844 --> 03:40.512
Dad, I'm here.

04:51.542 --> 04:54.003
Father, Father, Father.
Where's Por Yai going?

04:54.712 --> 04:57.589
Let him go, son.

06:19.046 --> 06:23.717
Pull... Pull... Pull it tight...
Lasso it.

06:23.717 --> 06:25.427
Come on, pull. Pull it.

08:03.567 --> 08:09.031
If I ever had the chance
to present Por Yai to the King...

08:11.742 --> 08:15.496
...it would be the biggest
honor of my life.

08:15.496 --> 08:20.876
At the very least, it would mean that
I upheld the name of the Jaturungkabart.

08:48.570 --> 08:49.530
Korn...

08:52.574 --> 08:53.617
I have something to show you.

08:54.660 --> 08:55.619
Nice, huh?

09:07.047 --> 09:10.300
I reckon this Songkran Water Festival
is going to be fun.

09:10.300 --> 09:13.220
Mr. Suthep is taking care of everything.

09:13.220 --> 09:15.389
He's throwing a huge party.

09:15.389 --> 09:18.350
Well, his son's now a member
of government.

09:18.350 --> 09:20.561
Hopefully he can give us back
some of our profits.

09:20.561 --> 09:24.773
Koi, I heard they are going to check
the elephants for royal status.

09:24.773 --> 09:26.942
Aren't you going to take your elephants

09:26.942 --> 09:29.027
to see if they're in with a chance?

09:38.453 --> 09:39.788
Say goodbye to Por Yai, Kham.

09:42.124 --> 09:45.794
After Por Yai has been checked...

09:45.794 --> 09:47.671
...we might not have the chance
to see him again.

09:51.174 --> 09:53.135
This could be
a great opportunity for you.

09:53.135 --> 09:54.636
There's no reason to worry.

10:18.410 --> 10:20.662
Annual Songkran Water Festival

10:22.831 --> 10:23.915
Mr. Koi,

10:23.915 --> 10:25.417
...this way, please.

10:25.417 --> 10:26.501
Hello.

10:26.501 --> 10:27.586
Welcome.

10:28.587 --> 10:30.422
Dad, they're here.

10:32.049 --> 10:33.091
Hello, Mr. Koi.

10:33.091 --> 10:34.885
- Please, come inside.
- Yes, sir.

10:34.885 --> 10:36.511
Everything's ready.

10:36.511 --> 10:37.679
Come in.

10:37.679 --> 10:38.764
Go on, Korn.

10:38.764 --> 10:40.474
Wait outside for a while.

10:40.474 --> 10:43.352
Your father should go in alone.

10:49.524 --> 10:52.361
This is Supoj, a friend of mine.

10:52.361 --> 10:53.862
Hello, sir.

10:53.862 --> 10:56.156
He takes care of this place.

10:56.156 --> 10:58.408
He will take care
of everything for you.

11:03.121 --> 11:06.249
Young man, would you like
a bell for your elephant?

11:06.249 --> 11:08.627
Do you want a bell?

11:08.627 --> 11:10.754
Do you want one?

11:12.506 --> 11:15.759
It's for good luck.

11:15.759 --> 11:17.344
Do you want one
for your elephant?

11:17.344 --> 11:19.638
- How much is this one?
- That one is 40 Baht.

11:19.638 --> 11:21.431
It's not expensive.

11:21.431 --> 11:24.226
Buy a bell for your elephant
and get good luck.

11:24.226 --> 11:25.310
Thank you, sir.

11:30.357 --> 11:31.400
Let me take a look.

11:32.234 --> 11:34.403
That's lovely.

11:37.239 --> 11:38.490
Let's go.

11:53.797 --> 11:57.843
BLIND BOXING

12:53.148 --> 12:54.274
Thank you.

12:55.984 --> 12:57.486
Come on.

12:57.486 --> 12:59.321
Bring it here.

13:00.322 --> 13:01.406
Wait! Wait!

13:01.406 --> 13:03.158
Are you taking him away today?

13:03.158 --> 13:05.035
Yes, today.

13:05.035 --> 13:06.787
You can go back home and wait there.

13:06.787 --> 13:07.871
I will let you know what happens later.

13:07.871 --> 13:08.955
<i>But...</i>

13:08.955 --> 13:10.165
Come on. Quickly.

13:15.212 --> 13:17.088
Move it.

13:18.131 --> 13:19.257
Come on.

13:20.300 --> 13:21.593
Quickly.

13:22.427 --> 13:23.386
Come on... Come on...

13:24.262 --> 13:26.640
You can't take him.
Not yet.

13:26.640 --> 13:27.724
I won't let you.

13:27.724 --> 13:29.267
You can't.

13:29.267 --> 13:32.020
You can't.
You can't take him.

13:32.020 --> 13:34.564
I said you can't take him.

13:34.564 --> 13:35.732
Force it to go.

13:35.732 --> 13:37.192
I said you can't take him.

13:37.192 --> 13:39.194
You old fart, I told you!

14:06.179 --> 14:07.472
Move it. Quickly.

15:04.988 --> 15:06.156
Look! Elephants.

15:13.830 --> 15:16.249
Didn't you see the truck?!

15:21.713 --> 15:22.797
Father!

15:24.174 --> 15:25.342
Father...

15:25.342 --> 15:27.177
What happened, Father?

15:27.177 --> 15:28.845
- Father...
- Kham.

15:30.013 --> 15:31.389
Check on Por Yai.

16:19.187 --> 16:21.189
I said move!

16:53.930 --> 16:57.350
Oracle Ceremony - To Find Por Yai

18:58.054 --> 19:00.098
<i>Baby, we belong together</i>

19:00.098 --> 19:02.642
<i>enjoying the forest with a joyful heart.</i>

19:02.642 --> 19:05.186
<i>The waterfall pours down</i>

19:05.186 --> 19:08.273
<i>as if heaven was before our eyes.</i>

19:08.273 --> 19:13.403
<i>Birds 000 like my loving words for you.</i>

19:40.722 --> 19:42.932
Who the hell are you?

19:42.932 --> 19:44.434
Do you want my foot in your mouth?

19:55.195 --> 19:56.946
Go on. Get him.

20:14.881 --> 20:16.507
Go get him!

20:26.976 --> 20:28.228
My teeth!

20:35.693 --> 20:37.403
Wait for me!

20:47.163 --> 20:48.456
Where are Por Yai and Korn?

20:49.582 --> 20:50.959
- Where are they?
- I don't know!

20:50.959 --> 20:52.085
I don't know.

20:52.085 --> 20:53.253
You don't know?
You don't know?

20:53.253 --> 20:56.047
Johnny--
Johnny took them.

20:56.047 --> 20:58.383
They're in Sydney.

21:01.386 --> 21:02.512
Where is he?

21:04.138 --> 21:05.306
Father!

21:05.306 --> 21:06.891
Shoot!
Shoot him!

21:17.277 --> 21:18.987
Enough.

21:18.987 --> 21:20.697
You're hurting me.

21:22.907 --> 21:24.200
Come on. Quickly.

21:27.245 --> 21:28.246
Move it.

23:24.737 --> 23:28.032
Sydney, 2 Weeks Later

25:21.312 --> 25:22.522
What beautiful mangoes.

25:22.522 --> 25:24.106
Hello. How are you?

25:24.106 --> 25:25.441
They look lovely.

25:26.651 --> 25:27.735
How much?

25:27.735 --> 25:29.946
Do you want some?
Take some.

25:31.239 --> 25:33.032
Take them. It's no problem.

25:33.032 --> 25:35.243
- How much?
- Forget it.

25:35.243 --> 25:36.827
- Are you sure?
- Just take them.

25:36.827 --> 25:38.287
Well, okay, then.
Can I take two more?

25:38.287 --> 25:39.956
Take them. Go on.

25:39.956 --> 25:41.541
- Thank you very much.
- Not at all.

26:36.012 --> 26:37.555
You look like you're constipated
or something.

27:40.117 --> 27:41.369
Hey, Tui.

27:41.369 --> 27:42.787
You stupid prick.

27:42.787 --> 27:44.163
What the hell do you think you're doing?

27:44.163 --> 27:45.581
How did you know, Sarge?

27:45.581 --> 27:47.875
You idiot. With a face like that,
who wouldn't be able to spot you?

27:47.875 --> 27:49.919
Put the damn gun down.
Put it down!

27:49.919 --> 27:50.961
<i>Stay aw 3Y-</i>

27:50.961 --> 27:52.672
If you come any closer, I'll shoot.

27:52.672 --> 27:55.925
Shoot me if you want,
but don't forget your mother.

27:55.925 --> 27:58.260
When she gets here,
you're in deep shit.

27:58.260 --> 28:00.096
Don't lie to me.

28:00.096 --> 28:01.180
My mom isn't here.

28:01.180 --> 28:02.890
She is. Look behind you!

28:15.486 --> 28:16.946
Come on, imbecile.

28:52.732 --> 28:54.275
Go on, run.

28:54.275 --> 28:55.443
Don't be such a wimp.

28:55.443 --> 28:56.652
You idiot.

29:08.414 --> 29:13.210
Just forget it. You idiot! Go! Go! Go!

29:16.589 --> 29:18.215
Shit! When did that happen?

29:18.215 --> 29:20.426
Why didn't anyone tell me?

30:15.147 --> 30:18.442
<i>If the NGOS truly understood</i>

30:18.442 --> 30:20.611
<i>the elephant situation here,</i>

30:20.611 --> 30:22.071
<i>then they wouldn't be against us.</i>

30:24.990 --> 30:27.159
From all the exits to the meeting room,

30:27.159 --> 30:30.162
guards have been placed
at every 10 meters.

30:30.162 --> 30:33.666
Uncle, I have
arranged everything for you.

30:33.666 --> 30:36.502
I've hired Sydney's top chef
to make abalone soup.

30:36.502 --> 30:38.212
I made it for all of you.

30:38.212 --> 30:39.880
I hope everyone will enjoy it.
Especially you, Uncle.

30:40.923 --> 30:44.009
You should have more of it.
This is good for your health.

30:45.094 --> 30:48.931
It will keep you strong.
With good health,

30:48.931 --> 30:51.475
you'll be able to look after
the family business forever.

31:02.695 --> 31:04.530
Are you sure this is abalone?

31:05.322 --> 31:07.449
It's bland. There's no aroma
and no sweetness.

31:07.449 --> 31:09.869
It tastes like earthworms.

31:11.328 --> 31:14.164
You know earthworms, right?

31:14.164 --> 31:19.879
Slithering insects
which have 2 genders...

31:19.879 --> 31:21.422
without being either.

31:23.382 --> 31:25.926
So what about it, Rose?

31:25.926 --> 31:28.137
If you can't even
provide proper food for me,

31:28.137 --> 31:30.306
how do you expect to protect me?

31:32.474 --> 31:35.477
For security,
it's better to let Cheng handle it.

31:36.520 --> 31:38.314
I think this is better.

31:38.314 --> 31:43.068
When your father was alive,
Cheng was in charge.

31:45.446 --> 31:49.074
What you do shows
no respect to our clients.

31:50.993 --> 31:55.080
We are negotiating
with representatives of the government.

31:55.080 --> 31:59.919
If we unite with them,
our business will grow rapidly.

32:01.211 --> 32:04.757
Concentrate on the restaurant
I gave you.

32:04.757 --> 32:09.094
That's enough responsibility
for you, Rose.

32:15.517 --> 32:19.396
That stupid old man made me lose face
in front of everyone.

32:20.648 --> 32:25.986
You don't need to be angry or impatient.

32:28.489 --> 32:31.909
You already have this, don't you?

32:38.290 --> 32:41.669
I think this new fate of mine
will finally rid me of that old man.

35:04.103 --> 35:05.646
A tricycle is faster than this.

35:15.280 --> 35:16.698
God, you drive like a pensioner.

37:24.576 --> 37:26.119
I didn't do anything wrong.

38:02.948 --> 38:05.075
What are you doing here?

38:05.075 --> 38:07.035
Oh! Are you Thai?

38:07.035 --> 38:10.706
I'm speaking Thai.
Do you think I'm Burmese?

38:10.706 --> 38:12.624
Did you come to Sydney
to break the law?

38:12.624 --> 38:15.544
No, sir. I've come here to find Por Yai
and my little brother.

38:15.544 --> 38:17.504
- You're looking for your relatives?
- Yes, sir.

38:17.504 --> 38:20.590
- What do they look like?
- Like elephants.

38:20.590 --> 38:22.092
Elephants?

38:23.135 --> 38:24.553
Elephants?

38:24.553 --> 38:27.139
Who's like an elephant in Thai town?

38:27.139 --> 38:29.433
Come on. Let's talk about this
back at my office.

38:33.812 --> 38:34.771
Mark!

38:37.441 --> 38:38.358
Hello.

38:38.358 --> 38:40.193
How's it going, Goong?

38:40.193 --> 38:42.237
- Are your clients keeping you busy?
- Not really.

38:42.237 --> 38:44.698
It's your fault.
You never visit my restaurant.

38:44.698 --> 38:45.949
I'm really busy.

38:45.949 --> 38:47.826
- There's a new promotion on.
- Yeah?

38:47.826 --> 38:49.077
Special price at lunchtime.

38:49.077 --> 38:50.996
- I'll go if I have time.
- Okay.

38:53.457 --> 38:55.083
It's a Thai restaurant.

38:55.083 --> 38:57.711
Tom Yum Goong is Thai food.

38:57.711 --> 38:59.504
So why did they hire
a Vietnamese guy like Johnny

38:59.504 --> 39:01.006
to be the general manager?

39:01.340 --> 39:03.383
- Johnny!Johnny!
-Shut up!

39:05.510 --> 39:07.721
- Okay. See you later.
- See you.

39:07.721 --> 39:09.056
- Work hard.
- You, too.

39:09.056 --> 39:10.015
Follow them quickly. Hurry up!

39:12.559 --> 39:15.020
- Don't start any trouble.
- Follow that car quickly!

39:15.020 --> 39:16.730
Quiet down! Quiet down!

39:19.816 --> 39:22.069
Those are the people
that took Por Yai and Korn.

39:22.069 --> 39:23.737
Don't say that.

39:23.737 --> 39:25.655
You can't accuse someone
without any evidence.

39:25.655 --> 39:27.699
I have a photo, but it's in the taxi.

39:27.699 --> 39:29.534
Don't waste my time.
We'll talk at the station.

39:33.622 --> 39:35.290
Let him go!

40:07.948 --> 40:09.199
Where are my elephants?

40:11.159 --> 40:12.119
Where are my elephants?

40:15.288 --> 40:16.873
Johnny!

40:33.390 --> 40:35.767
Johnny!
Give me back my elephants.

40:41.022 --> 40:44.609
We are both Thais. So I'll warn you.

40:44.609 --> 40:46.153
Don't get involved with them.

49:36.557 --> 49:37.809
I know.

49:40.311 --> 49:42.647
You're an ugly son of a bitch.

51:03.519 --> 51:05.021
<i>Kings sit upon the elephants.</i>

51:10.401 --> 51:12.528
<i>Vital areas are underneath.</i>

51:16.115 --> 51:17.992
<i>Enemies aim for those areas.</i>

51:22.497 --> 51:25.208
<i>Soldiers protect the 4 most vital areas
of the elephants.</i>

51:30.379 --> 51:32.048
<i>What are the vital areas, Dad?</i>

51:37.428 --> 51:39.555
<i>One day you will know, Kham.</i>

56:04.612 --> 56:05.571
Tui.

56:06.447 --> 56:07.782
What the hell are you doing?

56:07.782 --> 56:10.159
He forced me to do it, Sarge. I...

58:41.936 --> 58:43.062
Mark.

58:43.062 --> 58:44.104
This is Goong.

58:44.104 --> 58:45.564
Where are you?

58:45.564 --> 58:47.816
I just watched the news,
and I'm worried about you.

58:49.068 --> 58:50.903
Don't say anything.

58:50.903 --> 58:52.947
Someone might be listening.

58:52.947 --> 58:54.657
Can we meet?

58:54.657 --> 58:56.825
Pla'sjust called me.

58:56.825 --> 58:59.745
She has evidence which can prove
that you're innocent.

58:59.745 --> 59:02.540
She won't see me unless I see you first.

59:02.540 --> 59:04.500
No problem. Where?

59:15.803 --> 59:17.513
Mark?

59:17.513 --> 59:18.722
I'm sorry.

01:00:42.890 --> 01:00:45.684
Ever since Johnny came here...

01:00:45.684 --> 01:00:48.020
it has been hell for everyone.

01:00:49.688 --> 01:00:53.150
Everyone from the waitresses
to the manager.

01:00:57.613 --> 01:00:59.448
I don't know what to do.

01:00:59.448 --> 01:01:03.535
They built a secret entrance
at the back of the restaurant...

01:01:03.535 --> 01:01:06.205
for their VIP clients.

01:01:06.205 --> 01:01:08.165
Everyone wants to know...

01:01:08.165 --> 01:01:09.875
what goes on up there.

01:01:23.472 --> 01:01:27.351
Maybe the relative you are
looking for is up there.

01:01:39.196 --> 01:01:40.781
Where's Johnny?

01:06:12.970 --> 01:06:14.429
Where are my elephants?

01:06:27.359 --> 01:06:28.777
Where are my elephants?

01:06:30.529 --> 01:06:32.614
What's he saying?

01:06:32.614 --> 01:06:34.241
Where are my elephants?

01:10:12.209 --> 01:10:13.293
Korn!

01:10:58.880 --> 01:11:00.423
Korn!

01:11:56.688 --> 01:11:58.273
Have you found your brother?

01:12:06.406 --> 01:12:09.826
Korn!

01:12:10.535 --> 01:12:11.703
Korn!

01:12:11.703 --> 01:12:13.997
Shit! An elephant!

01:12:13.997 --> 01:12:15.040
A real elephant!

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:18.918
- How did you get here?
- Korn!

01:13:05.799 --> 01:13:10.178
Rose, the heir to the business
should be Sim's son.

01:13:11.179 --> 01:13:15.058
But Chao is only 13. He's still a child.

01:13:15.058 --> 01:13:17.644
He doesn't yet have the ability
to run the family business.

01:13:17.644 --> 01:13:23.942
Then the most suitable person
should be Kang.

01:13:23.942 --> 01:13:26.528
He is the son of Third Aunt,

01:13:26.528 --> 01:13:30.782
who is the younger sister
of both Sim and your father.

01:13:30.782 --> 01:13:31.866
Um, that should be good.

01:13:31.866 --> 01:13:34.661
Kang has just graduated
in Management from England.

01:13:34.661 --> 01:13:37.247
He should be able to take good care
of the business.

01:13:37.247 --> 01:13:40.166
Why don't any of you think
about how I feel?

01:13:40.166 --> 01:13:42.710
I am also my father's child.

01:13:42.710 --> 01:13:47.006
I have devoted everything
to this family.

01:13:48.049 --> 01:13:50.927
I would always help Uncle
when he was still alive.

01:13:52.512 --> 01:13:57.058
Take a good look at yourself.
You're neither a man nor a woman.

01:13:57.058 --> 01:14:00.061
How do you expect us
to let you run the family business?

01:14:00.061 --> 01:14:02.939
We wouldn't be able
to show our faces in public.

01:14:04.399 --> 01:14:06.943
Kang! What's wrong with you?

01:14:06.943 --> 01:14:09.696
Please don't scare me. Help! Help!

01:14:11.948 --> 01:14:15.118
You! Why did you do this?

01:14:15.118 --> 01:14:16.995
The most suitable person is dead...

01:14:18.413 --> 01:14:19.914
What's wrong? Tell me, Chao!

01:14:19.914 --> 01:14:24.127
...and the second is dying.
Is there anyone suitable left?

01:14:25.170 --> 01:14:28.923
In that case,
I accept the responsibility.

01:14:30.633 --> 01:14:32.427
I promise you all...

01:14:32.427 --> 01:14:35.805
I will make the family business
better than ever.

01:14:36.848 --> 01:14:40.226
I won't let you down.
I won't let my father down.

01:14:42.103 --> 01:14:43.938
And I hope for the utmost cooperation
from you all.

01:16:56.279 --> 01:16:57.405
Be patient, Korn.

01:17:00.491 --> 01:17:02.035
We'll find Por Yai together.

01:17:45.411 --> 01:17:46.954
Hey, Kham.

01:17:46.954 --> 01:17:48.039
We can't stay here anymore.

01:17:49.457 --> 01:17:52.085
I think we've disturbed you
enough, Father.

01:17:53.127 --> 01:17:54.921
Thank you very much
for your gracious assistance.

01:17:56.047 --> 01:17:58.132
Once you have stepped on fire,

01:17:58.132 --> 01:18:05.014
no matter how far you run,
your feet will still burn.

01:18:06.057 --> 01:18:08.935
At least we won't cause you
any problems.

01:18:08.935 --> 01:18:12.313
I must go now, Father. Come on, Kham.

01:18:29.372 --> 01:18:32.709
- What are you going to do now?
- I must find PorYai.

01:18:32.709 --> 01:18:34.627
I think that transsexual
knows something.

01:18:40.842 --> 01:18:42.635
I think we should
go back to the temple first.

01:18:51.394 --> 01:18:52.812
Father!

01:18:56.899 --> 01:18:58.735
Someone, help!

01:18:58.735 --> 01:19:00.069
Get out quickly. Go on.

01:25:33.712 --> 01:25:34.880
Kham!

01:25:56.694 --> 01:25:58.696
You should take the elephant
back to Bangkok.

01:25:59.738 --> 01:26:00.990
I have connections at the port.

01:26:00.990 --> 01:26:02.867
It would be easy for you to go back.

01:26:02.867 --> 01:26:04.160
What about you, Sarge?

01:26:04.160 --> 01:26:05.536
Don't worry about me.

01:27:24.698 --> 01:27:26.116
Where's my elephant?

01:27:27.993 --> 01:27:29.286
Where is he?

01:28:30.848 --> 01:28:32.266
You piece of shit!

01:28:35.227 --> 01:28:36.270
Korn!

01:28:37.438 --> 01:28:38.939
You're scum!

01:28:41.608 --> 01:28:44.236
Your mother's a dirty whore.

01:30:00.312 --> 01:30:02.648
This majestic elephant...

01:30:03.816 --> 01:30:04.983
...will enhance your dominion.

01:30:05.818 --> 01:30:08.112
All will bow to you...

01:30:08.987 --> 01:30:11.031
...and the power which you hold.

01:39:04.898 --> 01:39:07.400
Korn! Korn!

01:39:09.194 --> 01:39:13.949
Korn! Korn!

01:41:34.881 --> 01:41:37.133
<i>An elephant is most vulnerable
at its tendons.</i>

01:41:37.133 --> 01:41:39.594
<i>If its tendons are severed,
it will fall.</i>

01:42:52.167 --> 01:42:53.626
Wait.

01:44:16.960 --> 01:44:18.628
Are you okay, Goong?

01:44:38.356 --> 01:44:40.400
Somsak, sir.

01:44:40.400 --> 01:44:42.402
- God, are you Thai?
- Aren't I speaking clear enough?

01:44:42.402 --> 01:44:43.528
You sarcastic piece of shit!

01:45:20.231 --> 01:45:23.693
<i>Elephants have represented Thailand
for many years.</i>

01:45:23.693 --> 01:45:31.117
<i>We respect them as if they were
our own brothers, our family.</i>

01:45:31.117 --> 01:45:35.413
<i>Thai people don't appreciate it
if anyone tries to hurt an elephant.</i>

01:45:35.413 --> 01:45:38.458
<i>Actually, Thai people like peace.</i>

01:45:41.169 --> 01:45:44.130
<i>But we don't like it
when people take liberties.</i>

01:47:06.087 --> 01:47:08.714
Kham, we have to go.
