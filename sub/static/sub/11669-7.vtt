- I mean...
- Oh, my God, of course not.

12:26.979 --> 12:28.913
- It's better for the baby.
- It is better for the baby.

12:28.981 --> 12:30.414
So much better for the baby.

12:30.483 --> 12:31.745
- Yeah.
- We are having a water birth,

12:32.084 --> 12:36.111
but instead of water, we're gonna fill the tub
with gender-neutral barley.

12:36.188 --> 12:39.453
Which is also the name of the
baby it will be better for.

12:39.525 --> 12:40.924
- Oh, what a cute name.
- Little Barley.

12:40.993 --> 12:42.051
You see how well that goes together.

12:42.128 --> 12:44.790
My midwife suggested a sea turtle birth.

12:44.864 --> 12:48.231
- What is that?
- Oh, it's when you give birth on a beach

12:48.300 --> 12:51.235
and you dig a small hole
and you kick sand on the baby

12:51.303 --> 12:54.033
and you see if it crawls into
the ocean or into your arms.

12:54.106 --> 12:55.937
- Wow.
- It's better for the baby.

12:56.008 --> 12:57.873
You know what?
I would be careful, though, with a midwife.

12:57.943 --> 12:59.410
Even though they're not technically doctors,

12:59.478 --> 13:01.810
- they still have some medical training.
- It's close enough.

13:01.881 --> 13:03.974
And I just don't trust
western medicine at this point.

13:04.049 --> 13:07.450
That's why I'm having my baby
on the highest mountaintop in Tibet,

13:07.520 --> 13:10.489
as far from real medical help
as is humanly possible.

13:10.556 --> 13:11.545
- Oh yeah.
- So smart.

13:11.624 --> 13:13.057
- My doula's a Sherpa.
- Oh.

13:13.125 --> 13:17.824
My doula is a three-month-old baby,
so she, like, gets it.

13:17.897 --> 13:20.491
Oh hey, but right when the baby's crowning,

13:20.566 --> 13:22.033
we're gonna take a bunch of rose petals

13:22.101 --> 13:24.365
and shove them up my pussy
so when she's born

13:24.436 --> 13:26.870
it looks just like that

13:30.042 --> 13:33.534

put it in a heroin balloon and just, like,

mule it to Tijuana so it's bilingual.

13:41.487 --> 13:44.081
Well, I hope you all plan
on eating the placenta.

I don't care about myself.

14:02.107 --> 14:04.371
Oh, my God, I don't care
if I die during childbirth.

14:04.510 --> 14:06.705
I hope I die during childbirth.
That's how I feel.

14:06.879 --> 14:09.939
A mother haunting their baby
is the best thing for the baby.

14:10.149 --> 14:12.083

- How do you know it was pubes?

15:25.658 --> 15:27.523
You could tell it was pubes
because they were short and curly.

- Well, I got pubes up here, but...

- Mmm-hmm.
- Let's talk about it.

Do you think people overuse
the word "psychopath"?

18:06.552 --> 18:07.917
- Yes.
- Does it bug you?

18:07.986 --> 18:11.513
Yes. Remember Robert Hare,

- of all of this stuff...
- Yeah.

I mean, I met a Haitian death squad leader
called Toto Constant.

18:54.900 --> 18:57.494
Yes. I remember
an Islamic fundamentalist called Omar Bakri

18:57.569 --> 19:01.005
once outed me as a Jew
at his jihad training camp

- Oh, in the Gatwick.
