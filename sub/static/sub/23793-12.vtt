16TH-CENTURY NOBLEMAN, SO INBRED

01:40.467 --> 01:41.300
THAT WHEN A GIRL WALKED IN WITH

01:41.367 --> 01:42.266
AN ITTY-BITTY WAIST AND A ROUND

01:42.333 --> 01:43.367
THING IN HIS FACE, HE JUST

01:43.433 --> 01:44.266
SNEEZED OUT OF HIS ELBOW AND

01:44.333 --> 01:48.467
DIED.

01:48.533 --> 01:51.133
A LITTLE BIT OF HISTORY FOR YOU.

01:51.200 --> 01:51.867
PERHAPS THE MOST NOTABLE PART OF

01:51.934 --> 01:54.000
THE SERVICE WAS

01:54.066 --> 01:55.734
BISHOP MICHAEL CURRY, WHO

01:55.800 --> 01:57.433
DELIVERED AN IMPASSIONED ODE TO

01:57.500 --> 01:59.200
LOVE, WHICH LED TO SOME PRETTY

01:59.266 --> 02:00.467
AWKWARD REACTION SHOTS.

02:00.533 --> 02:01.734
>> THERE WERE SOME OLD SLAVES IN

02:01.800 --> 02:02.967
AMERICA'S ANTEBELLUM SOUTH WHO

02:03.033 --> 02:05.867
EXPLAINED THE DYNAMIC POWER OF

02:05.934 --> 02:06.967
LOVE AND WHY IT HAS THE POWER

02:07.033 --> 02:08.100
TO TRANSFORM --

02:08.166 --> 02:09.266
THEY EXPLAINED IT

02:09.333 --> 02:10.433
THIS WAY, THEY SANG A SPIRITUAL

02:10.500 --> 02:11.266
EVEN IN THE MIDST OF THEIR

02:11.333 --> 02:12.934
CAPTIVITY.

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
THEY SAID IF YOU CANNOT PREACH

02:15.066 --> 02:16.867
LIKE PETER AND YOU CANNOT PRAY

02:16.934 --> 02:19.000
LIKE PAUL, YOU JUST TELL THE

02:19.066 --> 02:23.200

02:23.266 --> 02:24.900
SAVE US ALL.

OH, THAT'S THE BALM IN GILEAD.

02:26.967 --> 02:28.367
THIS WAY OF LOVE, IT IS A WAY OF

02:28.433 --> 02:30.033
LIFE.

02:30.100 --> 02:32.433
THEY GOT IT.

02:32.500 --> 02:36.700

02:43.800 --> 02:44.834
THOSE ARE SOME OF THE

02:44.900 --> 02:45.633
MOST REPRESSED PEOPLE ON EARTH.

02:45.700 --> 02:47.033
TALKING TO THE QUEEN ABOUT LOVE

02:47.100 --> 02:48.100
IS LIKE TALKING TO HER ABOUT THE

02:48.166 --> 02:51.834
TRANSFORMATIVE POWER OF THE

02:51.900 --> 03:04.233
$5 CHALUPA CRAVINGS BOX.

03:04.300 --> 03:05.867
"I'M NOT INTERESTED, IT DOESN'T

03:05.934 --> 03:07.834
APPLY, IT SOUNDS

03:07.900 --> 03:10.500
DISGUSTING, AND IF I EVER

03:10.567 --> 03:11.600
EXPERIENCED IT, I'D BREAK OUT

03:11.667 --> 03:12.400
IN HIVES."

03:12.467 --> 03:13.133
BUT FOR NOW, LET'S MOVE ON TO

03:13.200 --> 03:14.000
NORTH KOREA.

03:14.066 --> 03:14.700
A COUNTRY LED BY A MAN WHO IS

03:14.767 --> 03:15.300
BOTH A BRUTAL DICTATOR AND THE

03:15.367 --> 03:16.333
ONLY PERSON WHO'S EVER BEEN

03:16.400 --> 03:16.934
EXCITED TO GET A PICTURE TAKEN

03:17.000 --> 03:17.567
WITH MIKE POMPEO.

03:17.633 --> 03:18.333
THE PROPOSED SUMMIT BETWEEN

03:18.400 --> 03:19.066
DONALD TRUMP AND KIM JONG UN IS

03:19.133 --> 03:20.300
SCHEDULED TO TAKE PLACE ON

03:20.367 --> 03:20.934
JUNE 12, BUT THIS WEEK, IT HIT A

03:21.033 --> 03:21.333
MAJOR SNAG.

03:21.400 --> 03:22.066
>> NORTH KOREA NOW SAYS IT MAY

03:22.133 --> 03:22.967
CALL OFF KIM JONG UN'S MEETING

03:23.033 --> 03:23.900
WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP OVER U.S.

03:23.967 --> 03:24.934
DEMANDS TO DENUCLEARIZE THE

03:25.000 --> 03:26.300
KOREAN PENINSULA.

03:26.367 --> 03:28.100
>> John: YES, THE SUMMIT IS IN

03:28.166 --> 03:29.367
JEOPARDY FOR A NUMBER OF

03:29.433 --> 03:31.166
REASONS, FROM THE FACT THAT BOTH

03:31.233 --> 03:31.800
SIDES APPARENTLY HAVE DIFFERENT

03:31.867 --> 03:34.567
DEFINITIONS OF WHAT

03:34.633 --> 03:35.934
"DENUCLEARIZATION" MEANS TO

03:36.000 --> 03:36.934
NORTH KOREA'S OBJECTIONS TO THE

03:37.000 --> 03:37.934
U.S. AND SOUTH KOREA HOLDING A

03:38.000 --> 03:38.967
JOINT TRAINING EXERCISE CALLED

03:39.033 --> 03:40.200
"MAX THUNDER."

03:40.266 --> 03:41.233
WHICH, INCIDENTALLY, SOUNDS WAY

03:41.300 --> 03:42.233
TOO MUCH LIKE A PORN NAME FOR A

03:42.300 --> 03:44.300
MILITARY EXERCISE.

03:44.367 --> 03:45.900
IT'S AS IF THE BIN LADEN RAID

03:45.967 --> 03:47.400
HAD BEEN CALLED

03:47.467 --> 03:48.533
"OPERATION DICK THICKHOG:

03:48.600 --> 03:52.100
BIN LADEN GOES DOWN."

03:52.166 --> 03:53.767
NOW, NEGOTIATING WITH

03:53.834 --> 03:55.400
NORTH KOREA IS CLEARLY THE

03:55.467 --> 03:56.867
TIGHTEST OF TIGHTROPES TO WALK,

03:56.934 --> 03:57.834
AND UNFORTUNATELY, INSTEAD OF A

03:57.900 --> 03:58.900
PROFESSIONAL TIGHTROPE WALKER,

03:58.967 --> 03:59.767
TRUMP HAS BROUGHT IN A

03:59.834 --> 04:01.633
BIG OL' WALRUS.

04:01.700 --> 04:02.934
SPECIFICALLY, THIS BIG OL'

04:03.000 --> 04:04.967
WALRUS, JOHN BOLTON, THE

04:05.033 --> 04:06.567
BRAND-NEW NATIONAL SECURITY

04:06.633 --> 04:07.533
ADVISER, WHO'S BEEN APPEARING ON

04:07.600 --> 04:08.367
TV MAKING A PRETTY ALARMING

04:08.433 --> 04:10.633
STATEMENT.

04:10.700 --> 04:12.033
>> IS IT A REQUIREMENT THAT

04:12.100 --> 04:13.667
KIM JONG UN AGREE TO GIVE AWAY

04:13.734 --> 04:16.333
THOSE WEAPONS BEFORE YOU GIVE

04:16.400 --> 04:17.367
ANY KIND OF CONCESSION?

04:17.433 --> 04:18.266
>> I THINK THAT'S RIGHT.

04:18.333 --> 04:19.800
I THINK WE'RE LOOKING AT THE

04:19.867 --> 04:22.934
LIBYA MODEL OF 2003-2004.

04:23.000 --> 04:23.867
>> John: YES, "THE LIBYA MODEL."

04:23.934 --> 04:26.700
NOW, THAT MAY NOT SOUND LIKE

04:26.767 --> 04:28.100
MUCH TO YOU, BUT BOLTON BRINGING

04:28.166 --> 04:29.133
UP LIBYA IS LITERALLY THE WORST

04:29.200 --> 04:29.967
THING HE COULD HAVE SAID IN THIS

04:30.033 --> 04:31.066
SITUATION.

04:31.133 --> 04:33.000
IT'S LIKE IF YOUR WIFE SAYS "DO

04:33.066 --> 04:33.633
THESE JEANS MAKE ME LOOK FAT?"

04:33.700 --> 04:34.700
AND YOU SAY "I'M FUCKING THE

04:34.767 --> 04:42.433
BABYSITTER."

04:42.500 --> 04:43.967
ANYTHING, ANYTHING WOULD BE

04:44.033 --> 04:45.500
BETTER THAN THAT, BECAUSE THE

04:45.567 --> 04:46.266
LIBYA MODEL HE'S TALKING ABOUT

04:46.333 --> 04:46.967
INVOLVED A DEAL THE U.S. AND

04:47.033 --> 04:48.166
OTHERS STRUCK TO GET LIBYA TO

04:48.233 --> 04:50.667
GIVE UP THEIR NUCLEAR WEAPONS

04:50.734 --> 04:50.900
PROGRAM.

04:50.967 --> 04:52.100
BUT FOR DICTATORS LIKE

04:52.166 --> 04:53.467
KIM JONG UN, THAT EXAMPLE IS

04:53.533 --> 04:56.233
SOMEWHAT TAINTED FOR REASONS SO

04:56.300 --> 04:57.633
OBVIOUS EVEN THE HUMAN

04:57.700 --> 04:58.400
THROW PILLOWS ON

04:58.467 --> 04:59.467
"FOX AND FRIENDS" COULD

04:59.533 --> 05:00.467
UNDERSTAND.

05:00.533 --> 05:01.266
>> MAYBE JOHN BOLTON PROBABLY

05:01.333 --> 05:02.467
SHOULDN'T HAVE MENTIONED LIBYA

05:02.533 --> 05:03.200
JUST BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, FOR A

05:03.266 --> 05:03.800
LOT OF PEOPLE THEY THINK, HOW

05:03.867 --> 05:04.934
DID THAT END?

05:05.000 --> 05:06.200
OH, YEAH, GADDAFI WAS DRAGGED

05:06.266 --> 05:06.934
THROUGH THE STREETS --

05:07.000 --> 05:09.200
>> IT'S THE ONE THING YOU

05:09.266 --> 05:10.100
REMEMBER ABOUT THAT OPERATION.

05:10.166 --> 05:11.533
>> YEAH, EXACTLY.

05:11.600 --> 05:12.834
>> John: YEAH, EXACTLY.

05:12.900 --> 05:14.066
EXACTLY.

05:14.133 --> 05:17.033
EXCEPT THEY'RE MISSING OUT A KEY

05:17.100 --> 05:17.633
DETAIL, AS BEFORE GADAFFI WAS

05:17.700 --> 05:18.800
DRAGGED THROUGH THE STREETS AND

05:18.867 --> 05:19.800
KILLED, HIS ENEMIES SODOMIZED

05:19.867 --> 05:21.333
HIM WITH A BAYONET.

05:21.400 --> 05:22.500
AND LET'S AGREE, THAT IS THE

05:22.567 --> 05:27.233
WORST WAY TO DIE,

05:27.300 --> 05:28.000
RIGHT AFTER...

05:28.066 --> 05:28.700
BEING IN A

05:28.767 --> 05:29.500
PORT-A-POTTY WHEN BEYONCE WALKS

05:29.567 --> 05:30.867
IN ON YOU AND YOU'RE SO

05:30.934 --> 05:31.667
EMBARRASSED THAT YOU SLAM THE

05:31.734 --> 05:32.800
DOOR ON HER AND THE FORCE OF THE

05:32.867 --> 05:33.800
SLAM KNOCKS THE PORT-A-POTTY

05:33.867 --> 05:35.166
OVER A CLIFF, AND AS YOU FALL

05:35.233 --> 05:37.033
DOWN YOU HEAR BEYONCE YELLING,

05:37.100 --> 05:38.567
"YOU'LL NEVER DO ANYTHING AS

05:38.633 --> 05:41.000
FUNNY AS CARPOOL KARAOKE," AND

05:41.066 --> 05:42.800
AND AS YOU LAND UPSIDE-DOWN

05:42.867 --> 05:43.767
YOU REALIZE THE ONLY ONE WHO

05:43.834 --> 05:45.100
CAN SAVE YOU FROM DROWNING IN

05:45.166 --> 05:45.934
YOUR OWN FECES IS DUSTIN HOFFMAN

05:46.000 --> 05:47.300
AND THE LAST WORDS YOU HEAR ARE,

05:47.367 --> 05:49.100
"REMEMBER ME, MOTHERFUCKER?"

05:49.166 --> 05:50.033
I ASSUME THAT THAT FEAR IS

05:50.100 --> 05:51.600
UNIVERSAL.

05:51.667 --> 05:55.567
ANYWAY, IT'S NOT IMPORTANT.

05:55.633 --> 05:57.500
THE POINT IS,

05:57.567 --> 05:58.533
IT'S NOT JUST KIM JONG UN

05:58.600 --> 05:59.166
WHO'S TOUCHY ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED

05:59.233 --> 06:00.133
IN LIBYA.

06:00.200 --> 06:01.633
GADDAFI'S DEATH IS A COMMON

06:01.700 --> 06:03.166
OBSESSION AMONG AUTOCRATS --

06:03.233 --> 06:03.767
IN FACT, EVEN PUTIN APPARENTLY

06:03.834 --> 06:04.934
THINKS ABOUT IT A LOT.

06:05.000 --> 06:06.100
>> PUTIN WATCHES THAT TAPE OVER

06:06.166 --> 06:08.667
AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

06:08.734 --> 06:09.834
IT'S ALL HE CAN TALK ABOUT FOR

06:09.900 --> 06:13.433
QUITE SOME TIME.

06:13.500 --> 06:15.667
>> VLADIMIR PUTIN WAS DETERMINED

06:15.734 --> 06:17.367
GADDAFI'S FATE WOULD NOT BE HIS

06:17.433 --> 06:18.433
OWN.

06:18.500 --> 06:19.934
>> John: OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

06:20.000 --> 06:21.000
I'M NOT ACTUALLY SURPRISED BY

06:21.066 --> 06:23.100
THAT.

06:23.166 --> 06:24.734
'CAUSE IF YOU TOLD ME THERE'S A

06:24.800 --> 06:26.100
VIDEO PUTIN WATCHES OVER AND

06:26.166 --> 06:27.400
OVER AGAIN, I WOULD GUESS IT'S

06:27.467 --> 06:28.400
OF SOMEONE BEING MURDERED.

06:28.467 --> 06:29.567
THAT'S HIS "BIG LEBOWSKI."

06:29.633 --> 06:31.033
HE JUST THROWS IT ON IN THE

06:31.100 --> 06:32.133
BACKGROUND WHENEVER HE'S FOLDING

06:32.200 --> 06:34.200
LAUNDRY.

06:34.266 --> 06:35.600
IN FACT, FOR A SENSE OF JUST HOW

06:35.667 --> 06:37.233
BADLY BOLTON SCREWED UP HERE,

06:37.300 --> 06:38.233
TRUMP ACTUALLY WALKED HIS

06:38.300 --> 06:41.166
COMMENTS BACK HERE.

06:41.233 --> 06:42.934
YES, DONALD TRUMP, A MAN WHO

06:43.000 --> 06:44.934
WOULD DOUBLE DOWN ON A FUCKING

06:45.000 --> 06:47.533
TYPO, WENT ON TV AND SAID THIS:

06:47.600 --> 06:49.333
>> WELL, THE LIBYAN MODEL ISN'T

06:49.400 --> 06:51.333
A MODEL THAT WE HAVE AT ALL WHEN

06:51.400 --> 06:53.333
WE'RE THINKING OF NORTH KOREA.

06:53.400 --> 06:58.867
>> John: NOW, THAT IS THE

06:58.934 --> 07:00.367
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES

07:00.433 --> 07:01.834
DIRECTLY CONTRADICTING ONE OF

07:01.900 --> 07:02.967
HIS TOP ADVISERS -- A MAN WHO,

07:03.033 --> 07:04.300
INCIDENTALLY, WAS STANDING IN

07:04.367 --> 07:05.533
THE ROOM THE WHOLE TIME.

07:05.600 --> 07:10.700
AND LOOK, JOHN BOLTON, HOW CAN I

07:10.767 --> 07:13.000
PUT THIS TO YOU, WHAT YOU DID,

07:13.066 --> 07:16.000
IN TERMS YOU CAN UNDERSTAND?

07:16.066 --> 07:16.934
YOUR DECISION TO SAY THE WORDS

07:17.000 --> 07:17.767
"THE LIBYA MODEL" MAY'VE PUT

07:17.834 --> 07:22.867
YOUR TIME IN THE WHITE HOUSE ON

07:22.934 --> 07:23.900
THE PATH OF THE SCARAMUCCI

07:23.967 --> 07:24.700
MODEL.

07:24.767 --> 07:25.734
A MODEL WHICH MEANS YOU SHOOT

07:25.800 --> 07:26.500
YOUR MOUTH OFF, GET FIRED

07:26.567 --> 07:27.367
QUICKLY, AND END UP POSING FOR

07:27.433 --> 07:28.100
PHOTOS IN FRONT OF A FROZEN

07:28.166 --> 07:28.934
YOGURT SHOP WITH WHICH YOU SHARE

07:29.000 --> 07:29.834
A DUMB NICKNAME.

07:29.900 --> 07:30.600
AND IN TERMS OF PAIN AND

07:30.667 --> 07:32.133
HUMILIATION, THAT EXIT TRULY IS

07:32.200 --> 07:32.734
THE EQUIVALENT OF A BAYONET UP

07:32.800 --> 07:33.400
THE ASS.

07:33.467 --> 07:34.467
AND NOW THIS.

07:34.533 --> 07:39.667
>> Announcer: AND NOW,

07:39.734 --> 07:42.467
LOCAL NEWS GETS A LITTLE TOO

07:42.533 --> 07:43.834
BRITISH FOR THE ROYAL WEDDING.

07:43.900 --> 07:46.066
>> IF YOU CAN ENJOY A PHONY

07:46.133 --> 07:47.767
BRITISH ACCENT, THIS IS THE WEEK

07:47.834 --> 07:48.600
OF THE YEAR FOR YOU.

07:48.667 --> 07:50.867
>> TELL US THE DETAILS AND DO IT

07:50.934 --> 07:55.166
IN A BRITISH ACCENT FOR FUN.

07:55.233 --> 07:59.934
>> 'ELLO, GOVERNOR.

08:00.000 --> 08:07.400
>> 'ELLO, GOVERNOR.

08:07.467 --> 08:12.667
>> CHEERIO.

08:12.734 --> 08:13.266
>> CHEERIO.

08:13.333 --> 08:15.166
>> HERE IN LONDON FOR THE ROYAL

08:15.233 --> 08:15.400
WEDDING.

08:15.467 --> 08:19.300
>> A SPOT OF TEA.

08:19.367 --> 08:21.000
>> A SPOT OF TEA.

08:21.066 --> 08:23.734
>> WE DO HAVE THREE ACCENTS IN

08:23.800 --> 08:25.467
TOWN THIS MORNING.

08:25.533 --> 08:26.066
>> CHEERIO.

08:26.133 --> 08:28.100
>> THE LAST TIME WE SPOKE WITH

08:28.166 --> 08:31.734
AN ACCENT, WE MADE IT ON HBO.

08:31.800 --> 08:33.900
>> THAT'S RIGHT, AT THE JOHN

08:33.967 --> 08:34.266
OLIVER SHOW.

08:34.333 --> 08:35.834
MAYBE WE'LL DO IT AGAIN.

08:35.900 --> 08:40.166
>> FROM THE TOWN OF WINDSOR!

08:40.233 --> 08:44.900
>> John: MOVING ON.

08:44.967 --> 08:45.867
OUR MAIN STORY TONIGHT CONCERNS

08:45.934 --> 08:46.700
REHAB: THE MOST COMMON PLACE TO

08:46.767 --> 08:47.567
GO AFTER HITTING ROCK BOTTOM,

08:47.633 --> 08:49.500
OTHER THAN DAVE AND BUSTERS.

08:49.567 --> 08:50.300
DON'T LET THEIR SMILES FOOL YOU,

08:50.367 --> 08:51.300
EVERY ONE OF THOSE MEN IS AT

08:51.367 --> 08:52.767
THE LOWEST POINT IN THEIR LIVES

08:52.834 --> 08:53.100
IN THAT PHOTO.

08:53.166 --> 08:53.900
REHAB IS A PLACE WHERE PEOPLE

08:54.000 --> 08:55.166
CAN ADDRESS AN ADDICTION TO

08:55.233 --> 08:55.934
DRUGS OR ALCOHOL -- SOMETHING

08:56.000 --> 08:56.967
THAT, UNTIL RELATIVELY RECENTLY,

08:57.033 --> 08:58.233
WAS SEEN AS A MORAL FAILING THAT

08:58.300 --> 08:59.500
COULD BE OVERCOME WITH SHEER

08:59.567 --> 09:00.367
WILLPOWER, PERHAPS BEST

09:00.433 --> 09:04.700
EPITOMIZED BY THIS AMAZING PSA

09:04.767 --> 09:06.700
FROM THE '80s STARRING SINGER

09:06.767 --> 09:09.133
BELINDA CARLISLE.

09:09.200 --> 09:12.000
>> I USED TO DO DRUGS, AND ONE

09:12.066 --> 09:13.433
MORNING, I WOKE UP, I LOOKED IN

09:13.500 --> 09:14.533
THE MIRROR, AND I SAID, YOU LOOK

09:14.600 --> 09:15.567
FRIGHTENING.

09:15.633 --> 09:17.100
I GOT SICK OF IT, SO I QUIT.

09:17.166 --> 09:25.934
AND NOW, LIFE'S A BEACH!

09:26.000 --> 09:29.500
>> John: RAD.

09:29.567 --> 09:30.467
NOW, INCIDENTALLY,

09:30.533 --> 09:31.600
BELINDA CARLISLE

09:31.667 --> 09:32.500
HAS SINCE ADMITTED THAT, AFTER

09:32.567 --> 09:33.600
THAT PSA WAS SHOT, SHE USED

09:33.667 --> 09:34.900
COCAINE FOR ANOTHER 20 YEARS, TO

09:34.967 --> 09:35.800
A POINT WHERE -- AND I AM

09:35.867 --> 09:37.400
QUOTING HER DIRECTLY HERE --

09:37.467 --> 09:38.633
"I'M SURPRISED I STILL HAVE A

09:38.700 --> 09:39.767
NOSE."

09:39.834 --> 09:43.934
WHICH IS THE KIND OF STATEMENT

09:44.000 --> 09:44.734
YOU ONLY NORMALLY HEAR FROM

09:44.800 --> 09:45.533
TODDLERS WHO JUST SPENT THE

09:45.600 --> 09:46.734
AFTERNOON WITH THEIR UNCLE.

09:46.800 --> 09:47.567
"HE TOLD ME HE GOT IT IN HIS

09:47.633 --> 09:49.100
FINGERS, AND I FUCKING FLIPPED,

09:49.166 --> 09:49.800
MAN!

09:49.867 --> 09:50.667
I WAS CRYING, SCREAMING, THE

09:50.734 --> 09:51.533
WHOLE THING.

09:51.600 --> 09:54.433
I'M SURPRISED I STILL HAVE A

09:54.500 --> 09:58.066
NOSE!

09:58.133 --> 09:59.700
IS IT STILL THERE?

09:59.767 --> 10:00.100
THE GUY IS FLAT

10:00.166 --> 10:11.734
FUCKING CRAZY!

10:11.800 --> 10:12.800
THANKFULLY, THERE'S NOW A

10:12.867 --> 10:13.667
BROADER UNDERSTANDING THAT

10:13.734 --> 10:14.467
ADDICTION IS COMPLEX AND THAT

10:14.533 --> 10:15.266
NOTHING ABOUT GETTING OFF

10:15.333 --> 10:16.633
ALCOHOL OR DRUGS IS EASY.

10:16.700 --> 10:17.266
EXPERTS NOW VIEW ADDICTION AS A

10:17.333 --> 10:17.900
MEDICAL PROBLEM, OFTEN LIKENED

10:17.967 --> 10:18.700
TO A DISEASE OR A CHRONIC

10:18.767 --> 10:19.567
CONDITION, AND A COMMON WAY OF

10:19.633 --> 10:20.233
TREATING IT IS THROUGH STINTS IN

10:20.300 --> 10:20.934
REHAB.

10:21.000 --> 10:21.734
IT'S A $35-BILLION INDUSTRY,

10:21.800 --> 10:22.500
WITH OVER 14,000 REHAB

10:22.567 --> 10:23.367
FACILITIES ACROSS THE UNITED

10:23.433 --> 10:24.133
STATES, SOME OF WHICH HAVE FANCY

10:24.200 --> 10:24.934
NAMES LIKE PROMISES OR PASSAGES

10:25.000 --> 10:25.734
OR MILESTONES -- YOU KNOW, NAMES

10:25.800 --> 10:26.867
THAT SOUND LIKE PERFUMES WORN

10:26.934 --> 10:28.400
EXCLUSIVELY BY WIDOWS.

10:28.467 --> 10:29.266
AND SOME REHABS CAN EVEN AFFORD

10:29.333 --> 10:32.500
TO RUN UBIQUITOUS COMMERCIALS

10:32.567 --> 10:38.934
LIKE THIS:

10:39.000 --> 10:39.667
>> CLIFFSIDE MALIBU HAS BEEN

10:39.734 --> 10:40.333
HELPING PEOPLE JUST LIKE YOU FOR

10:40.400 --> 10:41.066
OVER 12 YEARS.

10:41.133 --> 10:41.900
WE ACCEPT MOST INSURANCE.

10:41.967 --> 10:42.734
OUR EXPERIENCED, COMPASSIONATE

10:42.800 --> 10:43.700
STAFF WILL HELP YOU GET YOUR

10:43.767 --> 10:44.533
LIFE BACK.

10:44.600 --> 10:45.900
CALL THE NUMBER OR GO TO THE

10:45.967 --> 10:48.300
SITE BELOW NOW.

10:48.367 --> 10:49.467
DON'T WAIT.

10:49.533 --> 10:50.433
BECAUSE YOUR TOMORROW

10:50.500 --> 10:53.066
MAY NEVER COME.

10:53.133 --> 10:56.734
>> John: WHOA, THAT IS A HARD

10:56.800 --> 10:57.834
TURN THERE.

10:57.900 --> 10:59.233
THAT'S LIKE FROSTED FLAKES

10:59.300 --> 11:00.600
ENDING A COMMERCIAL WITH

11:00.667 --> 11:01.467
TONY THE TIGER GETTING SHOT BY

11:01.533 --> 11:05.867
POACHERS.

11:05.934 --> 11:06.567
NOW, IN RECENT YEARS, IT HAS

11:06.633 --> 11:07.467
GOTTEN EASIER TO GET INSURANCE

11:07.533 --> 11:08.433
TO PAY FOR REHAB.

11:08.500 --> 11:09.367
THAT'S LARGELY THANKS TO THE

11:09.433 --> 11:10.133
FACT THAT GEORGE W. BUSH PASSED,

11:10.200 --> 11:11.133
AND BARACK OBAMA EXPANDED, LAWS

11:11.200 --> 11:12.100
REQUIRING HEALTH INSURERS TO

11:12.166 --> 11:13.767
INCREASE COVERAGE FOR IT.

11:13.834 --> 11:15.333
BUT WHILE WE USE "REHAB" AS A

11:15.400 --> 11:17.166
SHORTHAND, IT'S WORTH KNOWING

11:17.233 --> 11:18.567
THAT THERE'S NO SET DEFINITION

11:18.633 --> 11:20.000
FOR WHAT IT SHOULD CONSIST OF.

11:20.066 --> 11:21.166
IN FACT, THERE ARE NO FEDERAL

11:21.233 --> 11:22.467
STANDARDS FOR COUNSELING

11:22.533 --> 11:24.700
PRACTICES OR REHAB PROGRAMS.

11:24.767 --> 11:27.400
AND WHILE MANY REHABS ARE

11:27.467 --> 11:28.967
BEST TO HELP, A REPORT A FEW

11:29.033 --> 11:30.433
YEARS AGO FOUND THAT THE VAST

11:30.500 --> 11:31.633
MAJORITY OF PEOPLE IN NEED OF

11:31.700 --> 11:32.734
ADDICTION TREATMENT DO NOT

11:32.800 --> 11:33.867
RECEIVE ANYTHING THAT

11:33.934 --> 11:34.767
APPROXIMATES EVIDENCE-BASED

11:34.834 --> 11:36.367
CARE.

11:36.433 --> 11:38.033
AND FOR A SENSE OF JUST HOW BAD

11:38.100 --> 11:40.100
THINGS CAN BE, LOOK AT FLORIDA,

11:40.166 --> 11:42.200
A STATE WHOSE REHAB INDUSTRY HAS

11:42.266 --> 11:43.767
SEEN AN EPIDEMIC OF OVERDOSE

11:43.834 --> 11:45.367
DEATHS AND FRAUD, TO THE POINT

11:45.433 --> 11:46.467
WHERE ONE LOCAL OFFICIAL ISSUED

11:46.533 --> 11:48.934
A CHILLING WARNING.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.467
>> THE CLEAR MESSAGE WOULD BE,

11:50.533 --> 11:52.100
STOP SENDING YOUR LOVED ONES TO

11:52.166 --> 11:54.200
SOUTH FLORIDA BECAUSE WE'RE

11:54.266 --> 12:04.967
SENDING THEM BACK IN BODY BAGS.

12:05.033 --> 12:05.934
>> John: HOLY SHIT.

12:06.000 --> 12:06.600
THAT IS THE WORST -- AND YET,

12:06.667 --> 12:08.066
MOST HONEST -- TOURISM SLOGAN

12:08.133 --> 12:08.633
FOR FLORIDA I'VE EVER HEARD.

12:08.700 --> 12:10.100
"COME TO SOUTH FLORIDA.

12:10.166 --> 12:11.433
WE'LL SEND YOU HOME IN A

12:11.500 --> 12:12.133
BODY BAG."

12:12.200 --> 12:13.500
SO TONIGHT, LET'S LOOK AT WHAT

12:13.567 --> 12:14.133
REHAB IS AND WHY THE INDUSTRY'S

12:14.200 --> 12:14.834
SO TROUBLED.

12:14.900 --> 12:15.734
AND LET'S BEGIN WITH THE FACT

12:15.800 --> 12:16.867
THAT REHAB SHOULD NEVER BE SEEN

12:16.934 --> 12:17.800
AS A QUICK FIX.

12:17.867 --> 12:19.066
IT'S OFTEN JUST THE FIRST STEP

12:19.133 --> 12:20.633
IN A LIFETIME OF RECOVERY.

12:20.700 --> 12:22.100
YET MANY OPERATORS MAKE HUGE

12:22.166 --> 12:23.900
CLAIMS ABOUT THEIR SUCCESS RATE.

12:23.967 --> 12:25.533
TAKE PASSAGES IN MALIBU.

12:25.600 --> 12:27.800
THE FATHER AND SON WHO RUN IT

12:27.867 --> 12:28.900
MAKE SOME PRETTY BIG PROMISES

12:28.967 --> 12:31.433
ABOUT WHAT THEY CAN DO FOR YOU.

12:31.500 --> 12:33.066
>> WHEN YOU SEND PATIENTS HOME,

12:33.133 --> 12:34.300
WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THEM?

12:34.367 --> 12:35.333
>> YOU'RE CURED.

12:35.400 --> 12:36.467
>> TOTALLY CURED.

12:36.533 --> 12:38.400
100%.

12:38.467 --> 12:40.834
>> YOU WILL NEVER USE DRUGS AND

12:40.900 --> 12:44.433
ALCOHOL AGAIN.

12:44.500 --> 12:46.033
YOUR DEPENDENCY HAS BEEN CURED.

12:46.100 --> 12:48.400
HAVE A WONDERFUL LIFE.

12:48.467 --> 12:49.767
>> John: BULLSHIT.

12:49.834 --> 12:50.667
FOR A START, THERE'S NO WAY,

12:50.734 --> 12:51.533
WHEN PATIENTS LEAVE, THIS

12:51.600 --> 12:54.867
ASSHOLE DOESN'T SAY "CIAO."

12:54.934 --> 12:58.266
THERE'S NO FUCKING WAY

12:58.333 --> 12:59.100
THAT SOUND DOESN'T COME OUT OF

12:59.166 --> 13:00.600
HIS LIPS.

13:00.667 --> 13:01.500
BUT IT'S NOT JUST PASSAGES.

13:01.567 --> 13:02.266
LOTS OF REHABS FEEL FREE TO MAKE

13:02.333 --> 13:03.133
SUSPICIOUSLY IMPRESSIVE CLAIMS,

13:03.200 --> 13:04.166
AS ONE RESEARCHER FOUND OUT.

13:04.233 --> 13:04.967
>> WE CALLED INPATIENT PROGRAMS

13:05.033 --> 13:06.066
AND ASKED THEM WHAT THEIR

13:06.133 --> 13:07.967
SUCCESS RATE WAS.

13:08.033 --> 13:09.500
AND THE LOWEST RATE WE GOT

13:09.567 --> 13:11.066
QUOTED WAS 80%.

13:11.133 --> 13:13.100
>> YOU KNOW, I DO KNOW THAT

13:13.166 --> 13:15.100
ABOUT 80% OF THE CLIENTS WHO

13:15.166 --> 13:16.033
HAVE COME IN HERE ARE NOW SOBER

13:16.100 --> 13:18.066
LONG-TERM.

13:18.133 --> 13:19.133
>> WE'VE HAD ABOUT AN 80%

13:19.200 --> 13:20.667
SUCCESS RATE HERE AT 180.

13:20.734 --> 13:23.200
>> AND THEN WE WOULD ASK, ON

13:23.266 --> 13:24.734
WHAT DATA DO YOU BASE THAT?

13:24.800 --> 13:26.934
AND NO ONE HAD ANY DATA.

13:27.000 --> 13:29.400
>> John: THEY HAD NO HARD DATA

13:29.467 --> 13:33.533
TO BACK UP THEIR CLAIMS.

13:33.600 --> 13:35.200
AND AT THAT POINT, WHY EVEN STOP

13:35.266 --> 13:35.934
AT 80%?

13:36.000 --> 13:36.800
WHY NOT SAY YOU HAVE A 140%

13:36.867 --> 13:37.800
SUCCESS RATE?

13:37.867 --> 13:38.900
"FOR EVERY 10 PEOPLE THAT COME

13:38.967 --> 13:41.667
INTO OUR FACILITY, 14 EMERGE

13:41.734 --> 13:42.600
COMPLETELY SOBER.

13:42.667 --> 13:43.233
WHERE DID THOSE EXTRA FOUR

13:43.300 --> 13:44.967
PEOPLE COME FROM?

13:45.033 --> 13:47.734
WE HAVE NO IDEA.

13:47.800 --> 13:51.000
THAT'S HOW GOOD WE ARE."

13:51.066 --> 13:53.200
AND THAT'S THE THING.

13:53.266 --> 13:54.700
REHABS' SUCCESS RATES ARE OFTEN

13:54.767 --> 13:55.400
JUST BASED ON SELF-REPORTED

13:55.467 --> 13:56.133
STATISTICS INVOLVING THEM SIMPLY

13:56.200 --> 13:56.834
CALLING FORMER CLIENTS.

13:56.900 --> 13:57.967
AND THOSE RESULTS CAN BE

13:58.033 --> 13:58.533
PROBLEMATIC, AS A MAN WHO'S

13:58.600 --> 13:59.166
PARTICIPATED IN ONE OF THOSE

13:59.233 --> 14:01.400
STUDIES CAN TELL YOU.

14:01.467 --> 14:02.667
>> THEY -- THEY CALL YOU UP AND

14:02.734 --> 14:05.000
THEY ASK HOW YOU'RE DOING, AND

14:05.066 --> 14:09.934
YOU JUST LIE.

14:10.900 --> 14:12.667
I MEAN, I JUST SAID, YOU KNOW,

14:12.734 --> 14:14.500
I'M FINE.

14:14.567 --> 14:18.734
BUT YEAH, I WAS DRINKING.

14:18.800 --> 14:20.934
LIKE, IT'S -- IT'S CRAZY, BUT I

14:21.000 --> 14:22.633
WAS EMBARRASSED TO SAY, YOU

14:22.700 --> 14:23.233
KNOW, I DIDN'T STAY SOBER.

14:23.300 --> 14:24.066
>> John: AND YOU CAN UNDERSTAND

14:24.133 --> 14:24.934
THAT FOR EVERY REASON.

14:25.000 --> 14:25.767
IT CAN BE HARD TO ADMIT YOU'VE

14:25.834 --> 14:26.800
RELAPSED.

14:26.867 --> 14:28.000
PLUS, IT'S A PHONE CALL, SO

14:28.066 --> 14:29.000
YOU'LL SAY WHATEVER IT TAKES TO

14:29.066 --> 14:31.433
MAKE IT END.

14:31.500 --> 14:33.000
'CAUSE GETTING SOBER MAY BE

14:33.066 --> 14:34.533
HARD, BUT NOTHING IS HARDER THAN

14:34.600 --> 14:35.834
AN 8-MINUTE PHONE CALL WITH

14:35.900 --> 14:36.967
ANOTHER HUMAN BEING.

14:37.033 --> 14:40.066
NOTHING.

14:40.133 --> 14:43.934
NOTHING AT ALL.

14:44.000 --> 14:45.734
AND, LOOK, FOR ALL THOSE CLAIMS

14:45.800 --> 14:47.066
OF SUCCESS, IT'S VERY HARD TO

14:47.133 --> 14:48.166
KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE GETTING

14:48.233 --> 14:48.800
AT ANY GIVEN REHAB.

14:48.867 --> 14:49.834
YOU MIGHT GET THE TRADITIONAL

14:49.900 --> 14:50.767
12-STEP-BASED APPROACH, WHICH

14:50.834 --> 14:51.600
UNDOUBTEDLY WORKS FOR SOME,

14:51.667 --> 14:53.367
ALTHOUGH MOST EXPERTS ARGUE THAT

14:53.433 --> 14:54.033
THERE SHOULD ALSO BE CONSISTENT

14:54.100 --> 14:55.200
ACCESS TO OTHER, NEWER

14:55.266 --> 14:56.200
TREATMENTS, LIKE CERTAIN

14:56.266 --> 14:57.400
BEHAVIORAL THERAPIES OR

14:57.467 --> 14:58.567
MEDICATIONS LIKE THESE.

14:58.633 --> 14:59.900
BUT REHABS ARE NOT REQUIRED TO

14:59.967 --> 15:02.400
OFFER THOSE.

15:02.467 --> 15:04.200
AND BECAUSE A REHAB CAN

15:04.266 --> 15:05.166
ESSENTIALLY BE WHATEVER ITS

15:05.233 --> 15:06.667
PROPRIETOR SAYS IT IS, THAT

15:06.734 --> 15:08.700
MEANS THEY CAN FRAME ALMOST

15:08.767 --> 15:09.934
ANYTHING AS TREATMENT.

15:10.000 --> 15:11.233
FOR INSTANCE, MANY HIGH-END

15:11.300 --> 15:12.567
REHABS OFFER SOMETHING CALLED

15:12.633 --> 15:13.300
"EQUINE THERAPY."

15:13.367 --> 15:16.266
AND, AGAIN, IF PEOPLE RESPOND TO

15:16.333 --> 15:18.834
THAT, THAT'S GREAT.

15:18.900 --> 15:19.734
BUT THERE IS NO EMPIRICAL

15:19.800 --> 15:20.700
EVIDENCE THAT, AS A TREATMENT

15:20.767 --> 15:21.767
FOR ADDICTION, IT WORKS, WHICH

15:21.834 --> 15:22.667
MEANS SOME PEOPLE WHO PAID A

15:22.734 --> 15:23.633
HIGH PRICE FOR IT CAN END UP

15:23.700 --> 15:25.266
HAVING THIS EXPERIENCE.

15:25.333 --> 15:27.300
>> THEY HAD, LIKE, THE WHOLE

15:27.367 --> 15:28.633
EQUINE THING.

15:28.700 --> 15:29.500
I MEAN, YOU CAN GO AND FUCKING

15:29.567 --> 15:31.200
PET HORSES.

15:31.266 --> 15:32.333
WHAT IS PETTING HORSES GONNA DO

15:32.400 --> 15:34.066
FOR ME?

15:34.133 --> 15:35.467
IT DIDN'T DO A GODDAMN THING.

15:35.533 --> 15:36.633
I DON'T EVEN FUCKING LIKE

15:36.700 --> 15:40.767
HORSES.

15:40.834 --> 15:45.633
>> John: OKAY, SO FIRST OF ALL,

15:45.700 --> 15:46.567
I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THAT GUY.

15:46.633 --> 15:47.233
SECOND OF ALL, HE'S TOTALLY

15:47.300 --> 15:47.934
RIGHT.

15:48.000 --> 15:49.033
HORSES CAN GO STRAIGHT TO HELL.

15:49.100 --> 15:49.867
WHY DO WE EVEN NEED THEM

15:49.934 --> 15:51.700
ANYMORE?

15:51.767 --> 15:52.533
OH, SURE, YOU COULD RIDE ONE

15:52.600 --> 15:54.033
SOMEWHERE, OR YOU COULD JUST

15:54.100 --> 15:55.200
DRIVE A CAR, WHICH IS LIKE A

15:55.266 --> 15:55.834
HORSE, EXCEPT IT CAN PLAY MUSIC

15:55.900 --> 15:56.700
AND DOESN'T CONSTANTLY SHIT

15:56.767 --> 16:02.300
EVERYWHERE.

16:02.367 --> 16:06.800
YOU'RE AN IDIOT, PATCHES!

16:06.867 --> 16:07.767
AN IDIOT.

16:07.834 --> 16:08.667
ONE OF THE PLACES THAT OFFERS

16:08.734 --> 16:09.333
EQUINE THERAPY IS CLIFFSIDE, THE

16:09.400 --> 16:10.166
PLACE FROM THE AD YOU SAW

16:10.233 --> 16:11.233
EARLIER.

16:11.300 --> 16:13.333
A MONTH OF TREATMENT THERE COSTS

16:13.400 --> 16:14.033
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS,

16:14.100 --> 16:14.700
AND ITS FOUNDER, RICHARD TAITE,

16:14.767 --> 16:15.266
GETS A LITTLE DEFENSIVE WHEN

16:15.333 --> 16:17.467
ASKED IF IT'S WORTH THE PRICE.

16:17.533 --> 16:18.533
>> LISTEN, $73,000 SOUNDS LIKE A

16:18.600 --> 16:20.433
LOT OF MONEY, BUT IF YOU GO TO

16:20.500 --> 16:22.400
THE FOUR SEASONS FOR 30 DAYS,

16:22.467 --> 16:22.600
OKAY?

16:22.667 --> 16:23.700
THAT'S GONNA BE FORTY GRAND.

16:23.767 --> 16:24.700
>> RIGHT.

16:24.767 --> 16:25.900
>> OKAY?

16:25.967 --> 16:27.300
WHAT DID YOU GET?

16:27.367 --> 16:28.900
WAS THERE ANY LIFE-CHANGING

16:28.967 --> 16:30.000
THING GOING ON THERE?

16:30.066 --> 16:30.934
EVERYTHING THAT WE'VE DONE HERE

16:31.000 --> 16:32.834
IS MINDFUL.

16:32.900 --> 16:33.967
IT ONLY SEEMS LIKE HORSESHIT TO

16:34.033 --> 16:36.033
PEOPLE THAT DON'T KNOW BETTER.

16:36.100 --> 16:37.133
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO KNOW

16:37.200 --> 16:38.367
BETTER, BRO, BECAUSE YOUR LIFE

16:38.433 --> 16:39.967
DIDN'T DEPEND ON IT.

16:40.033 --> 16:41.700
YOU DIDN'T GO THROUGH IT.

16:41.767 --> 16:44.033
>> John: OKAY, CALM DOWN, BRO.

16:44.100 --> 16:45.667
BESIDES, YOU'RE BEING A LITTLE

16:45.734 --> 16:47.767
UNFAIR TO THE FOUR SEASONS.

16:47.834 --> 16:49.333
PLENTY OF LIFE-CHANGING THINGS

16:49.400 --> 16:53.467
HAPPEN THERE.

16:53.533 --> 16:54.333
JUST LAST YEAR, JADEN SMITH

16:54.400 --> 16:55.367
CLAIMED THE ONE IN TORONTO

16:55.433 --> 16:57.500
SPIKED HIS PANCAKES WITH CHEESE

16:57.567 --> 17:01.000
AFTER KICKING HIM OUT OF HIS

17:01.066 --> 17:02.200
ROOM.

17:02.266 --> 17:03.266
IF A HANDFUL OF CANADIANS

17:03.333 --> 17:03.967
TRICKING AN EVICTED

17:04.033 --> 17:04.900
CHILD-MILLIONAIRE WITH

17:04.967 --> 17:09.000
UNDISCLOSED RICOTTA ISN'T A

17:09.066 --> 17:10.433
LIFE-CHANGING THING, I GUESS I

17:10.500 --> 17:11.400
DON'T KNOW WHAT IS.

17:11.467 --> 17:12.333
AND $73,000 FOR 30 DAYS DOES

17:12.400 --> 17:13.166
SOUND LIKE A LOT OF MONEY.

17:13.233 --> 17:14.233
BECAUSE IT IS A LOT OF MONEY.

17:14.300 --> 17:15.300
AND YOU WOULD HOPE THAT AT

17:15.367 --> 17:16.400
CLIFFSIDE, THEY COULD ACCOUNT

17:16.467 --> 17:17.333
FOR EVERY MOMENT OF TREATMENT AT

17:17.400 --> 17:20.600
THAT PRICE.

17:20.667 --> 17:21.367
BUT THAT DOES NOT SEEM TO BE THE

17:21.433 --> 17:22.400
CASE.

17:22.467 --> 17:23.700
>> WHERE ARE YOUR -- WHERE ARE

17:23.767 --> 17:24.400
YOUR PATIENTS AT TODAY?

17:24.467 --> 17:25.633
>> I DON'T KNOW.

17:25.700 --> 17:26.800
WHERE ARE THEY?

17:26.867 --> 17:28.000
WHERE'D THEY GO?

17:28.066 --> 17:28.867
NO, YOU'RE NOT --

17:28.934 --> 17:29.867
ROB'S NOT HERE.

17:29.934 --> 17:31.367
I HAVE NO IDEA.

17:31.433 --> 17:33.500
I HAVE NO IDEA.

17:33.567 --> 17:34.100
I HAVE NO IDEA.

17:34.166 --> 17:36.700
>> OKAY, DO THEY --

17:36.767 --> 17:41.500
>> THEY PROBABLY WENT TO --

17:41.567 --> 17:43.000
UM, UH...

17:43.066 --> 17:48.266
WHATEVER THEY DID, THERE'S A

17:48.333 --> 17:49.066
THERAPEUTIC, UH, MEANING BEHIND

17:49.133 --> 17:50.400
IT.

17:50.467 --> 17:52.900
>> John: GOOD SAVE, BRO.

17:52.967 --> 17:54.633
'CAUSE YOU WERE IN TROUBLE FOR A

17:54.700 --> 17:57.100
MINUTE THERE, BUT THE

17:57.166 --> 17:57.700
"THERAPEUTIC MEANING" LINE WAS

17:57.767 --> 17:58.567
INSPIRED.

17:58.633 --> 17:59.567
BECAUSE THE TRUTH IS, ANYTHING

17:59.633 --> 18:00.433
CAN HAVE A THERAPEUTIC MEANING.

18:00.500 --> 18:01.200
HIS PATIENTS ARE STROKING

18:01.266 --> 18:02.166
HORSES?

18:02.233 --> 18:04.333
THAT COULD BE THERAPEUTIC.

18:04.400 --> 18:05.400
THEY'RE BITING OWLS?

18:05.467 --> 18:07.133
THAT COULD BE THERAPEUTIC.

18:07.200 --> 18:08.300
EVEN THE ACT OF THEM BEING LOST

18:08.367 --> 18:10.033
COULD BE THERAPEUTIC.

18:10.100 --> 18:11.300
IT'S CALLED "INADVERTENT

18:11.367 --> 18:13.033
WILDERNESS THERAPY," AND IT'S

18:13.100 --> 18:16.834
140% SUCCESSFUL.

18:16.900 --> 18:18.367
AND LOOK, SO FAR, WE'VE JUST

18:18.433 --> 18:19.066
TALKED ABOUT THE FANCY, HIGH-END

18:19.133 --> 18:20.500
RESIDENTIAL FACILITIES.

18:20.567 --> 18:21.533
BUT THERE ARE OVERSIGHT PROBLEMS

18:21.600 --> 18:22.734
THROUGHOUT THE SYSTEM, BECAUSE

18:22.800 --> 18:23.800
IN MANY STATES, THE BARRIER TO

18:23.867 --> 18:25.467
OPENING A REHAB CAN BE

18:25.533 --> 18:26.867
DANGEROUSLY LOW.

18:26.934 --> 18:30.900
FOR EXAMPLE, IN IDAHO, AS LONG

18:30.967 --> 18:31.600
AS YOU ARE NOT OPERATING A

18:31.667 --> 18:32.367
RESIDENTIAL PROGRAMS FOR

18:32.433 --> 18:33.333
ADOLESCENTS, YOU DON'T NEED A

18:33.400 --> 18:34.633
LICENSE AT ALL.

18:34.700 --> 18:35.567
IN CALIFORNIA, AS LONG AS YOU

18:35.633 --> 18:36.900
TAKE PRIVATE-PAY CLIENTS, ANYONE

18:36.967 --> 18:38.166
CAN START AN OUTPATIENT REHAB

18:38.233 --> 18:39.900
CENTER.

18:39.967 --> 18:41.133
AND IN FLORIDA, IF YOU WANT TO

18:41.200 --> 18:42.500
OPEN A SOBER HOME -- A GROUP

18:42.567 --> 18:44.533
HOME WHERE PEOPLE STAY, OFTEN

18:44.600 --> 18:48.400
WHILE THEY RECEIVE OUTPATIENT

18:48.467 --> 18:49.367
TREATMENT -- THERE IS NOTHING IN

18:49.433 --> 18:50.867
STATE LAW TO STOP YOU.

18:50.934 --> 18:53.367
TECHNICALLY, OJ SIMPSON COULD

18:53.433 --> 18:55.166
OPEN ONE RIGHT NOW --

18:55.233 --> 18:56.934
WHICH WOULD OBVIOUSLY BE CALLED

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
"THE JUICE CLEANSE" -- AND THERE

18:59.066 --> 18:59.633
WOULD BE NOTHING STANDING IN HIS

18:59.700 --> 19:00.166
WAY.

19:00.233 --> 19:01.333
AND FLORIDA ACTUALLY PROVIDES A

19:01.400 --> 19:02.467
WINDOW INTO HOW THE FLOOD OF

19:02.533 --> 19:03.567
INSURANCE MONEY INTO TREATMENT

19:03.633 --> 19:04.633
CENTERS HAS CAUSED MASSIVE

19:04.700 --> 19:05.767
PROBLEMS, BECAUSE THE INDUSTRY

19:05.834 --> 19:07.200
BOOMED THERE, AND UNSCRUPULOUS

19:07.266 --> 19:08.433
OPERATORS HAVE FOUND IT WAY TOO

19:08.500 --> 19:10.200
EASY TO GAME THE SYSTEM.

19:10.266 --> 19:12.734
TAKE URINE TESTING.

19:12.800 --> 19:15.567
INSURANCE COVERS DRUG TESTS, AND

19:15.633 --> 19:17.200
SOME PLACES HAVE EXPLOITED THAT,

19:17.266 --> 19:18.934
ARRANGING FOR KICKBACKS FROM

19:19.000 --> 19:20.800
TESTING FACILITIES, BASICALLY

19:20.867 --> 19:22.400
MEANING THE MORE URINE THEY

19:22.467 --> 19:24.000
TAKE, THE MORE MONEY THEY MAKE,

19:24.066 --> 19:26.033
AND IT ADDS UP FAST.

19:26.100 --> 19:28.467
>> FOR A SINGLE $30 STORE-BOUGHT

19:28.533 --> 19:29.567
URINE TEST, YOU COULD GET UP TO

19:29.633 --> 19:30.567
$1500 IN PAYOUTS FROM INSURANCE

19:30.633 --> 19:33.266
COMPANIES.

19:33.333 --> 19:35.834
SO LET'S DO THE MATH.

19:35.900 --> 19:38.233
IF YOU RUN FIVE TESTS A WEEK ON

19:38.300 --> 19:40.133
A SINGLE ADDICT, THAT'S $7500.

19:40.200 --> 19:41.333
SIX ADDICTS AT FIVE TESTS A

19:41.400 --> 19:43.967
WEEK, $45,000.

19:44.033 --> 19:51.800
THAT'S OVER $2.3 MILLION A YEAR.

19:51.867 --> 19:52.633
>> John: EXACTLY.

19:52.700 --> 19:53.400
URINE IS SO VALUABLE THAT IN THE

19:53.467 --> 19:54.567
RECOVERY INDUSTRY, IT'S KNOWN AS

19:54.633 --> 19:55.266
"LIQUID GOLD."

19:55.333 --> 19:56.033
AND PEEING LIQUID GOLD SOUNDS

19:56.100 --> 19:57.000
LIKE THE SYMPTOM OF AN STD YOU

19:57.066 --> 19:57.967
CAN ONLY CONTRACT FROM FUCKING

19:58.033 --> 20:01.500
C3PO.

20:01.567 --> 20:04.333
"NO, C, I DON'T THINK 'ALL WOMEN

20:04.400 --> 20:06.700
BORN AFTER 1990 HAVE IT ANYWAY.'

20:06.767 --> 20:09.667
UNLESS YOU'RE SLEEPING WITH

20:09.734 --> 20:10.400
'ALL WOMEN BORN AFTER 1990.'

20:10.467 --> 20:11.700
C?

20:11.767 --> 20:16.433
ARE YOU?

20:16.500 --> 20:18.000
YOU ARE A DOG C.

20:18.066 --> 20:20.900
YOU ARE A DOG."

20:20.967 --> 20:21.734
AND WITH MONEY LIKE THAT TO BE

20:21.800 --> 20:22.900
MADE JUST FROM URINE, IT'S

20:22.967 --> 20:23.467
HARDLY SURPRISING THAT SOME

20:23.533 --> 20:24.367
OPERATORS HAVE GONE TO EXTREME

20:24.433 --> 20:25.233
LENGTHS TO ATTRACT PATIENTS WITH

20:25.300 --> 20:26.133
INSURANCE, EVEN ENGAGING IN

20:26.200 --> 20:26.967
SOMETHING CALLED "PATIENT

20:27.033 --> 20:30.633
BROKERING" OR "JUNKIE HUNTING."

20:30.700 --> 20:31.433
HERE IS HOW THAT WORKS.

20:31.500 --> 20:32.333
>> MERCEDES SMITH, A RECOVERING

20:32.400 --> 20:33.233
ADDICT HERSELF, TOLD US SOBER

20:33.300 --> 20:34.467
HOME OPERATORS COMPETE FOR

20:34.533 --> 20:35.700
ADDICTS WITH GOOD INSURANCE,

20:35.767 --> 20:37.400
ENTICING THEM WITH PROMISES OF

20:37.467 --> 20:39.100
FREE RENT, FREE FOOD, FREE

20:39.166 --> 20:40.900
CIGARETTES.

20:40.967 --> 20:42.767
>> WE WOULD HAVE TO DRIVE AROUND

20:42.834 --> 20:43.867
DEL REY.

20:43.934 --> 20:45.367
AND ANYBODY WITH, LIKE,

20:45.433 --> 20:47.066
SUITCASES, WE WOULD HAVE TO ASK

20:47.133 --> 20:48.367
THEM, "DO YOU HAVE INSURANCE?

20:48.433 --> 20:52.266
WE HAVE A PLACE YOU CAN GO."

20:52.333 --> 20:54.033
>> John: OKAY, SO IN TERMS OF

20:54.100 --> 20:55.500
QUESTIONS TO ASK PEOPLE FROM THE

20:55.567 --> 20:56.467
WINDOW OF A MOVING VEHICLE,

20:56.533 --> 20:57.333
"DO YOU HAVE INSURANCE?"

20:57.400 --> 20:58.333
IS BARELY LESS SINISTER THAN

20:58.400 --> 20:59.900
"WOULD YOU LIKE SOME CANDY?" OR

20:59.967 --> 21:03.200
"WHAT SIZE OF FLESH ARE YOU?"

21:03.266 --> 21:04.533
AND IT GETS EVEN GRIMMER.

21:04.600 --> 21:05.333
BECAUSE THE TRUTH IS, THERE CAN

21:05.400 --> 21:06.633
BE MORE MONEY IN A PATIENT

21:06.700 --> 21:07.567
RELAPSING THAN IN THEM

21:07.633 --> 21:09.300
RECOVERING.

21:09.367 --> 21:11.333
SO AT ITS WORST, THIS SYSTEM

21:11.400 --> 21:13.133
ENCOURAGES A CYCLE OF ADMISSION,

21:13.200 --> 21:14.700
RELAPSE, READMISSION, AND

21:14.767 --> 21:16.033
RELAPSE AGAIN.

21:16.100 --> 21:18.900
THE CYCLE EVEN HAS ITS OWN

21:18.967 --> 21:22.133
SPECIAL TERM.

21:22.200 --> 21:22.600
IT'S CALLED

21:22.667 --> 21:23.300
"THE FLORIDA SHUFFLE."

21:23.367 --> 21:24.300
AND IF YOU'RE NOT EXTREMELY

21:24.367 --> 21:25.133
LUCKY, THIS IS HOW IT ENDS.

21:25.200 --> 21:26.667
>> IN THE FLORIDA SHUFFLE, YOU

21:26.734 --> 21:27.600
GO IN AND OUT OF RECOVERY, IN

21:27.667 --> 21:29.166
AND OUT OF REHAB CENTERS, IN AND

21:29.233 --> 21:31.567
OUT OF SOBER HOMES, MILKING THE

21:31.633 --> 21:33.066
INDIVIDUAL FOR THEIR INSURANCE

21:33.133 --> 21:37.400
UNTIL THAT PERSON DIES.

21:37.467 --> 21:38.533
>> John: YEAH, THE FLORIDA

21:38.600 --> 21:39.033
SHUFFLE TURNS OUT TO BE

21:39.100 --> 21:39.767
HORRIFIC, AND NOT -- AS I'D

21:39.834 --> 21:40.600
ASSUMED -- A PARTY WHERE

21:40.667 --> 21:41.533
EVERYONE THROWS THEIR KEYS IN A

21:41.600 --> 21:42.734
BOWL AND GETS TO GO HOME AND

21:42.800 --> 21:48.433
FUCK THEIR NEIGHBOR'S ALLIGATOR.

21:48.500 --> 21:50.567
AND IF THAT THIS POINT YOU'RE

21:50.633 --> 21:52.000
THINKING,

21:52.066 --> 21:52.967
"WELL, I GUESS I JUST NEED TO BE

21:53.033 --> 21:53.633
EXTRA-CAREFUL WHEN LOOKING FOR

21:53.700 --> 21:55.667
TREATMENT," THAT'S THE FINAL BIG

21:55.734 --> 21:56.900
PROBLEM HERE.

21:56.967 --> 21:57.700
BECAUSE IT CAN BE NEARLY

21:57.767 --> 21:58.367
IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND GOOD,

21:58.433 --> 21:59.367
UNBIASED INFORMATION.

21:59.433 --> 22:00.033
LET'S SAY YOU'RE SITTING AT

22:00.100 --> 22:00.834
HOME, AND YOU SEE THIS AD, WHICH

22:00.900 --> 22:02.200
PLAYS A LOT.

22:02.266 --> 22:05.066
>> WE ARE THE ADDICTION NETWORK,

22:05.133 --> 22:06.567
AND IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH

22:06.633 --> 22:07.233
DRUGS OR ALCOHOL, YOU NEED TO

22:07.300 --> 22:08.033
CALL THE NUMBER ON YOUR SCREEN

22:08.100 --> 22:09.033
NOW.

22:09.100 --> 22:10.200
ADDICTION IS A DISEASE AND

22:10.266 --> 22:11.333
YOU CAN'T GO IT ALONE.

22:11.400 --> 22:12.900
THE CALL IS FREE, AND SO IS THE

22:12.967 --> 22:15.266
CONSULTATION.

22:15.333 --> 22:17.266
SO WHY HAVEN'T YOU CALLED?

22:17.333 --> 22:18.734
>> John: "WHY HAVEN'T YOU

22:18.800 --> 22:20.767
CALLED?"

22:20.834 --> 22:24.667
THAT IS A HOSTILE TONE YOU

22:24.734 --> 22:25.667
WOULD NOT TOLERATE ELSEWHERE.

22:25.734 --> 22:26.667
"TAMPAX TAMPONS -- WHY ISN'T ONE

22:26.734 --> 22:28.300
IN YOU RIGHT NOW?

22:28.367 --> 22:29.433
SERIOUSLY: EXPLAIN YOURSELF."

22:29.500 --> 22:30.967
BUT THE IMPORTANT THING TO

22:31.033 --> 22:32.934
UNDERSTAND IS THAT THE ADDICTION

22:33.000 --> 22:36.867
NETWORK IS NOT A REHAB.

22:36.934 --> 22:37.834
IT IS A REFERRALS BUSINESS,

22:37.900 --> 22:40.133
MEANING THEY MAKE MONEY BY

22:40.200 --> 22:41.967
ROUTING YOUR CALL TO CENTERS

22:42.033 --> 22:43.333
ALL OVER THE COUNTRY, WHICH

22:43.400 --> 22:44.266
REPORTEDLY PAY THEM $40 TO $50

22:44.333 --> 22:46.233
FOR YOUR CALL.

22:46.300 --> 22:47.600
SO IN A MOMENT OF CRISIS, YOUR

22:47.667 --> 22:49.667
INDIVIDUAL CIRCUMSTANCES ARE NOT

22:49.734 --> 22:50.533
BEING TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT.

22:50.600 --> 22:53.734
THEY'RE SIMPLY PLACING YOUR FATE

22:53.800 --> 22:54.700
IN THE HANDS OF WHOEVER HAS $50.

22:54.767 --> 22:55.767
WHICH IS A TERRIBLE SYSTEM.

22:55.834 --> 22:57.200
I HAVE $50, BUT I HAVE NO IDEA

22:57.266 --> 22:58.500
HOW TO TREAT SOMEONE WITH AN

22:58.567 --> 22:59.734
ADDICTION.

22:59.800 --> 23:01.400
I'D PROBABLY JUST GIVE THEM A

23:01.467 --> 23:02.567
COPY OF MY HANDMADE ANTI-DRUG

23:02.633 --> 23:04.000
PAMPHLET, TITLED:

23:04.066 --> 23:05.066
"NAPPING WITH THE DEVIL:

23:05.133 --> 23:06.800
PLEASE STOP DOING HEROIN."

23:06.867 --> 23:10.867
AND IF YOU'RE THINKING,

23:10.934 --> 23:11.667
"HOLD ON, I WOULDN'T FALL FOR A

23:11.734 --> 23:12.533
SKETCHY-LOOKING TV AD.

23:12.600 --> 23:14.300
I'D DO MY OWN RESEARCH."

23:14.367 --> 23:15.834
THAT IS GREAT.

23:15.900 --> 23:17.133
BUT LET'S SAY YOU SAW THAT

23:17.200 --> 23:19.767
CLIFFSIDE AD AND THOUGHT,

23:19.834 --> 23:20.600
"THAT LOOKS GOOD, BUT I WANT TO

23:20.667 --> 23:21.567
CHECK IT FIRST."

23:21.633 --> 23:22.567
WELL, A GOOGLE SEARCH WILL

23:22.633 --> 23:23.700
QUICKLY LAND YOU ON

23:23.767 --> 23:24.867
RehabReviews.com, WHICH SAYS

23:24.934 --> 23:26.133
THAT CLIFFSIDE IS THE CHOICE FOR

23:26.200 --> 23:27.700
"THOSE THAT HAVE TO HAVE THE

23:27.767 --> 23:28.834
FINEST OF EVERYTHING."

23:28.900 --> 23:30.467
OR YOU MIGHT LAND ON TheFix.com,

23:30.533 --> 23:35.834
WHOSE REVIEW OF CLIFFSIDE

23:35.900 --> 23:36.667
RAVES THAT IT IS "A GREAT CHOICE

23:36.734 --> 23:37.467
FOR ANYONE WHO HAS THE MEANS TO

23:37.533 --> 23:38.633
RECOVER THERE."

23:38.700 --> 23:39.734
WHAT YOU PROBABLY WON'T SEE ON

23:39.800 --> 23:40.967
EITHER OF THESE WEBSITES --

23:41.033 --> 23:41.867
AT LEAST, NOT UNLESS YOU KNOW

23:41.934 --> 23:42.900
WHERE TO LOOK -- IS THAT BOTH OF

23:42.967 --> 23:44.500
THEM ARE ACTUALLY OWNED BY

23:44.567 --> 23:45.633
RICHARD TAITE, THE FOUNDER OF

23:45.700 --> 23:46.667
CLIFFSIDE MALIBU.

23:46.734 --> 23:48.066
YOU REMEMBER, THE GUY WHO

23:48.133 --> 23:53.133
LOOKS LIKE MATT LAUER FUCKED A

23:53.200 --> 24:00.033
PAIR OF OAKLEY SUNGLASSES.

24:00.100 --> 24:00.567
AND THAT FACT OF OWNERSHIP

24:00.633 --> 24:01.367
CERTAINLY CASTS SOME DOUBT

24:01.433 --> 24:02.834
ON THE FACT THE FIX AWARDED

24:02.900 --> 24:04.734
CLIFFSIDE A RATING OF FIVE OUT

24:04.800 --> 24:05.333
OF FIVE STARS, PRESUMABLY ONE

24:05.400 --> 24:10.033
STAR FOR EVERY TEN PATIENTS

24:10.100 --> 24:10.734
WHOSE LOCATION HE'S COMPLETELY

24:10.800 --> 24:11.633
UNAWARE OF.

24:11.700 --> 24:14.000
AND LET'S SAY SOMEONE YOU LOVE

24:14.066 --> 24:14.600
WAS TRULY IN CRISIS

24:14.667 --> 24:15.433
AND YOU WANTED INFORMATION ON

24:15.500 --> 24:22.400
CLIFFSIDE FROM AN OUTSIDE

24:22.467 --> 24:23.033
SOURCE, LIKE WHAT COMPLAINTS HAD

24:23.100 --> 24:24.300
BEEN PLACED.

24:24.367 --> 24:25.266
TO GET THAT INFORMATION, YOU'D

24:25.333 --> 24:26.133
NEED TO FILE A PUBLIC RECORDS

24:26.200 --> 24:27.000
REQUEST WITH CALIFORNIA'S

24:27.066 --> 24:27.967
DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE

24:28.033 --> 24:29.000
SERVICES AND THEN WAIT FOR

24:29.066 --> 24:32.233
MONTHS FOR THEM TO SEND YOU

24:32.300 --> 24:33.467
WHAT COULD BE A HUGE PILE OF

24:33.533 --> 24:35.533
DOCUMENTS TO SORT THROUGH.

24:35.600 --> 24:41.367
AND THAT IS TOO LONG TO WAIT FOR

24:41.433 --> 24:44.233
IT'S AKIN TO PREGNANCY TEST

24:44.300 --> 24:44.800
THAT TAKES EIGHT AND A HALF

24:44.867 --> 24:46.967
MONTHS TO GIVE

24:47.033 --> 24:49.367
YOU RESULTS.

24:49.433 --> 24:50.333
EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS INDUSTRY

24:50.400 --> 24:51.633
IS INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT TO

24:51.700 --> 24:52.433
NAVIGATE.

24:52.500 --> 24:53.233
WHICH IS DANGEROUS, BECAUSE EVEN

24:53.300 --> 24:55.300
ONE OF ITS OWN TRADE GROUPS HAS

24:55.367 --> 24:56.600
WARNED THAT SOME SECTORS OF IT

24:56.667 --> 24:59.667
ARE OUT OF CONTROL.

24:59.734 --> 25:00.934
AND FOR A SENSE OF JUST HOW

25:01.000 --> 25:02.967
HELPLESS YOU CAN BE IN THE FACE

25:03.033 --> 25:04.033
OF ALL THIS, JUST LISTEN TO

25:04.100 --> 25:04.934
TOM McCLELLAN.

25:05.000 --> 25:06.200
HE WAS OBAMA'S DEPUTY DRUG CZAR.

25:06.266 --> 25:07.266
YOU WOULD THINK THAT, IF ANYONE

25:07.333 --> 25:08.667
KNOWS THIS WORLD, IT WOULD BE

25:08.734 --> 25:11.700
HIM.

25:11.767 --> 25:13.100
WELL, GUESS WHAT?

25:13.166 --> 25:14.734
>> I HAD BECOME AN EXPERT IN THE

25:14.800 --> 25:17.333
ADDICTION FIELD.

25:17.400 --> 25:21.600
AND THEN MY SON BECAME ADDICTED,

25:21.667 --> 25:25.066
AND I HAD NO IDEA WHAT TO DO.

25:25.133 --> 25:26.333
ALL THAT TRAINING, ALL THAT

25:26.400 --> 25:28.767
KNOWLEDGE ABOUT ADDICTION DID

25:28.834 --> 25:30.533
NOT PREPARE ME FOR THE MOST

25:30.600 --> 25:31.800
FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION OF ALL.

25:31.867 --> 25:33.133
WHERE DO YOU SEND YOUR KID FOR

25:33.200 --> 25:37.300
TREATMENT?

25:37.367 --> 25:39.133
>> John: IT'S TRUE.

25:39.200 --> 25:40.033
EVEN THE NATION'S

25:40.100 --> 25:41.266
DEPUTY DRUG CZAR COULDN'T

25:41.333 --> 25:42.033
CONFIDENTLY NAVIGATE THIS

25:42.100 --> 25:42.633
SYSTEM.

25:42.700 --> 25:43.467
AND THE TRAGEDY IS, HIS SON

25:43.533 --> 25:44.200
DIED.

25:44.266 --> 25:44.934
AND REMEMBER THE FUNNY GUY WHO

25:45.000 --> 25:45.834
HATED HORSES?

25:45.900 --> 25:46.834
HE DIED TOO.

25:46.900 --> 25:47.700
SO THIS IS A MATTER OF LIFE AND

25:47.767 --> 25:48.800
DEATH.

25:48.867 --> 25:49.900
AND IF YOU'RE WONDERING WHAT

25:49.967 --> 25:51.066
EXPERTS WOULD ADVISE YOU TO DO

25:51.133 --> 25:52.867
IN SEEKING TREATMENT, MANY WE

25:52.934 --> 25:54.567
SPOKE TO SUGGEST BEGINNING NOT

25:54.633 --> 25:55.867
WITH A REHAB --

25:55.934 --> 25:57.133
WHICH MAY TRY AND SELL YOU ON

25:57.200 --> 25:58.266
ITS OWN SERVICES -- BUT WITH A

25:58.333 --> 25:59.433
DOCTOR WHO IS BOARD-CERTIFIED IN

25:59.500 --> 26:02.433
ADDICTION MEDICINE.

26:02.500 --> 26:03.934
NOW, IT'S ONLY RECENTLY BECOME

26:04.000 --> 26:04.867
AN OFFICIAL SPECIALTY, SO THERE

26:04.934 --> 26:06.767
AREN'T MANY OF THEM, BUT YOU CAN

26:06.834 --> 26:09.867
FIND THOSE THAT EXIST AT THIS

26:09.934 --> 26:10.934
WEBSITE HERE.

26:11.000 --> 26:12.200
THEY MAY BE ABLE TO GUIDE YOU

26:12.266 --> 26:13.433
TOWARD A TREATMENT THAT BEST

26:13.500 --> 26:14.767
SUITS YOUR NEEDS, WHICH MIGHT

26:14.834 --> 26:18.367
WELL NOT BE A FANCY CENTER WHERE

26:18.433 --> 26:19.800
YOU HAVE TO PAY $73,000 TO HAVE

26:19.867 --> 26:23.233
THIS GUY LOSE YOU.

26:23.300 --> 26:24.900
LOOK, THIS SYSTEM CLEARLY BADLY

26:24.967 --> 26:26.433
NEEDS MORE EXPERTISE AND

26:26.500 --> 26:27.934
OVERSIGHT.

26:28.000 --> 26:29.700
AND UNTIL THEN, IT MAY BE

26:29.767 --> 26:31.133
REALLY IMPORTANT FOR ALL OF US

26:31.200 --> 26:32.433
TO UNDERSTAND THAT, AT PRESENT,

26:32.500 --> 26:33.734
THE WORD "REHAB" IS SO BROADLY

26:33.800 --> 26:34.867
DEFINED AS TO BE CLOSE TO

26:34.934 --> 26:37.834
MEANINGLESS.

26:37.900 --> 26:38.633
IT IS HONESTLY BARELY BETTER

26:38.700 --> 26:39.600
DEFINED THAN THE WORD

26:39.667 --> 26:41.200
"BUILDING."

26:41.266 --> 26:42.533
AND IF SOMEONE WERE TO TELL YOU,

26:42.600 --> 26:45.367
"I HAVE A DRUG PROBLEM, BUT

26:45.433 --> 26:46.767
DON'T WORRY, I'M GOING TO

26:46.834 --> 26:47.633
BUILDING IN FLORIDA," YOU WOULD

26:47.700 --> 26:49.100
NATURALLY SAY, "HOLD ON,

26:49.166 --> 26:50.166
WHAT BUILDING?

26:50.233 --> 26:51.533
WHERE DID YOU FIND THIS

26:51.600 --> 26:52.633
BUILDING?

26:52.700 --> 26:54.233
WHAT'S HAPPENING INSIDE IT?

26:54.300 --> 26:58.867
IS IT A HOSPITAL OR A HOOTERS?

26:58.934 --> 27:00.633
OR BOTH?

27:00.700 --> 27:07.433
IS IT A HOOTS

27:07.500 --> 27:08.500
WHAT'S THE PROOF IT WORKS?

27:08.567 --> 27:09.467
AND WHAT'S THE DOCTOR-TO-HORSE

27:09.533 --> 27:10.233
RATIO LIKE IN THERE?"

27:10.300 --> 27:11.266
AND SADLY, RIGHT NOW, IT CAN BE

27:11.333 --> 27:16.867
TOO DIFFICULT TO GET ANSWERS TO

27:16.934 --> 27:17.900
THOSE QUESTIONS, WHICH IS CRAZY,

27:17.967 --> 27:18.633
BECAUSE SO MUCH ABOUT BATTLING

27:18.700 --> 27:19.367
ADDICTION IS REALLY HARD.

27:19.433 --> 27:20.333
GETTING CLEAN IS HARD.

27:20.400 --> 27:21.200
STAYING CLEAN IS HARD.

27:21.266 --> 27:22.266
BUT GETTING GOOD,

27:22.333 --> 27:27.133
EVIDENCE-BASED, TRUSTWORTHY HELP

27:27.200 --> 27:30.800
SHOULD BE THE FUCKING EASY PART.

27:30.867 --> 27:33.200
AND RIGHT NOW, IT IS WAY TOO

27:33.266 --> 27:36.233
EASY TO LITERALLY WIND UP

27:36.300 --> 27:40.900
PISSING MONEY UP A FUCKING WALL?

27:40.967 --> 27:41.834
AND NOW THIS.

27:41.900 --> 27:42.533
>> Announcer: AND NOW, JUST LOOK

27:42.600 --> 27:43.467
AT THIS BUNCH OF ROYAL WEDDING

27:43.533 --> 27:43.834
SHIT.

27:43.900 --> 27:44.500
>> KFC MAKING SURE TO GET ON THE

27:44.567 --> 27:45.100
ROYAL WEDDING.

27:45.166 --> 27:45.934
THEY'RE CALLING IT THE

27:46.000 --> 27:46.767
ROYAL WEDDING BUCKET.

27:46.834 --> 27:47.433
>> BURGER KING HAS LAUNCHED A

27:47.500 --> 27:48.533
NEW SANDWICH.

27:48.600 --> 27:49.233
THE CHICKEN SANDWICH INCLUDES

27:49.300 --> 27:49.900
TWO ONION RINGS, SIGNIFYING THE

27:49.967 --> 27:51.667
ROYAL MATRIMONY.

27:51.734 --> 27:52.500
>> VELVEETA, THEY HAVE

27:52.567 --> 27:53.567
CROWN-SHAPED

27:53.633 --> 27:57.400
PASTA AND CHEESE.

27:57.467 --> 27:57.934
>> PRINCE HARRY AND MEGHAN

27:58.000 --> 27:58.433
