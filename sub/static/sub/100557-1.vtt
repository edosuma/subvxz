00:01.268 --> 00:02.267
(light music)

00:02.269 --> 00:04.336
(glass breaks)

00:42.543 --> 00:44.176
(radio stations changing)

00:44.178 --> 00:45.110
- Just pick, that one.

00:45.112 --> 00:45.944
What about now?

00:45.946 --> 00:47.079
Stop, go back two.

00:52.053 --> 00:53.018
No.

00:53.020 --> 00:53.719
- Okay, can you stop stressing?

00:53.721 --> 00:55.087
- Just pick one.

00:55.089 --> 00:56.422
I'm not the one stressing.

01:01.829 --> 01:03.095
- Pretty sure I
see some gray hairs

01:03.097 --> 01:05.264
up in that bird's nest of yours.

01:09.303 --> 01:10.402
- You wanna see a picture?

01:14.475 --> 01:16.875
That's me when I was five.

01:16.877 --> 01:18.243
That's my mom and my dad.

01:18.245 --> 01:20.646
That's where we're going.

01:20.648 --> 01:21.647
It's nice, right?

01:30.558 --> 01:32.791
(sighing)

01:38.199 --> 01:40.432
- How you feelin', baby?

01:40.434 --> 01:41.667
- I feel good.

01:44.405 --> 01:45.270
- How far are we?

01:46.974 --> 01:50.209
- About 20 miles.

01:52.246 --> 01:53.545
(lighter clicking)

01:53.547 --> 01:54.980
- Really?

01:54.982 --> 01:56.315
Come on, again
with those things?

01:56.317 --> 01:57.716
No, we're not doing that.

02:05.226 --> 02:06.391
- Who's that?

02:07.194 --> 02:09.094
Who's that guy?
- Stop.

02:10.164 --> 02:12.364
- Who's, what's his name?

02:12.366 --> 02:13.632
Sean?
- Stop.

02:13.634 --> 02:16.101
- Oh is that Carly's boyfriend?

02:19.006 --> 02:20.038
How are they doin'?

02:22.443 --> 02:25.611
Is she still mad at
him for what he did?

02:25.613 --> 02:26.745
- It's none of your business.

02:27.715 --> 02:29.581
- So who are these people?

02:29.583 --> 02:31.950
- God, just checking
my messages,

02:31.952 --> 02:32.784
calm down.
- How many messages

02:32.786 --> 02:33.685
do you have?

02:36.223 --> 02:37.222
Who's that guy?

02:37.224 --> 02:38.123
- Stop!

02:39.059 --> 02:40.058
- Who is that guy?

02:40.060 --> 02:41.660
- You're being an asshole, stop.

02:44.064 --> 02:45.330
- You know it was a good thing

02:45.332 --> 02:46.532
when I dropped my phone
in the urinal that time.

02:46.534 --> 02:48.567
It was the universe
telling me that

02:48.569 --> 02:49.868
no more phones.

02:49.870 --> 02:51.103
Should never got it fixed.

02:51.105 --> 02:53.272
- You know they do
come in handy, right?

02:53.274 --> 02:56.708
- Oh yeah, they come
in handy, so handy.

02:57.711 --> 02:58.577
- In case of
emergencies, you know,

02:58.579 --> 03:00.245
if your car breaks down.

03:00.247 --> 03:01.947
- For you, there seems
to be an emergency

03:01.949 --> 03:04.983
for like every 10 minutes,

03:04.985 --> 03:09.321
six minute blocks
of 10. (chuckling)

03:09.323 --> 03:11.123
Did you text your
mom I said hello?

03:12.193 --> 03:13.458
- Yes.

03:13.460 --> 03:14.459
- Text her right now,
tell her I said hello.

03:14.461 --> 03:15.460
- She said hello back already.

03:15.462 --> 03:16.295
- I wanna see you text her.

03:16.297 --> 03:17.329
I wanna see.

03:18.566 --> 03:20.265
- No, I'll do it later.
- Right, let me see.

03:20.267 --> 03:21.166
- Really.

03:22.303 --> 03:24.403
Let's just find a
rest stop, go pee

03:24.405 --> 03:25.904
and get to the place.

03:25.906 --> 03:27.239
How about that?

03:28.542 --> 03:30.776
(revving)

03:49.697 --> 03:51.563
- Bathroom's that way.

03:51.565 --> 03:54.199
- [Woman] Cool, I think I'm
gonna go call my mom, okay?

03:54.201 --> 03:55.100
- Okay.

04:05.379 --> 04:08.247
(zipping)

04:08.249 --> 04:12.751
(trickling)
(toilet flushing)

04:12.753 --> 04:15.153
(splashing)

04:33.540 --> 04:35.874
(slamming)

04:54.128 --> 04:55.794
- [Woman] What's wrong?

04:55.796 --> 04:58.196
- Which way did that car go?

04:58.198 --> 04:59.431
The guy that came out

04:59.433 --> 05:00.932
like two, three
seconds before me.

05:00.934 --> 05:01.867
This was his car.

05:03.704 --> 05:04.970
Where, they beam him up?

05:04.972 --> 05:06.338
What, this makes no sense.

05:06.340 --> 05:08.073
- Baby I didn't see a guy.

05:08.075 --> 05:09.641
I mean I was on my phone.

05:10.944 --> 05:12.678
So maybe I missed
him, I don't know.

05:17.518 --> 05:19.751
- That is so weird.

05:21.655 --> 05:23.021
- Don't worry
about it, let's go.

05:23.023 --> 05:23.855
Come back to the car.
- Wait a minute.

05:23.857 --> 05:24.756
No, stop, stop.

05:26.026 --> 05:26.858
Well you were standing there.

05:29.496 --> 05:30.312
Which way did he go?

05:30.313 --> 05:31.129
- I don't know, what
did he look like?

05:31.131 --> 05:32.230
- The black car,
when we pulled in,

05:32.232 --> 05:33.432
there was a black car

05:33.434 --> 05:34.366
in here.
- I didn't see a black car.

05:34.368 --> 05:35.667
I probably just missed it

05:35.669 --> 05:36.868
'cause I was on my phone.

05:36.870 --> 05:38.437
Don't worry about it,
let's go, come on.

05:39.540 --> 05:41.440
- Oh so you admit that
you were on your phone.

05:41.442 --> 05:42.407
That's the problem.

05:42.409 --> 05:43.675
- Yes, I admit that I was

05:43.677 --> 05:44.676
on my phone, Billy.
- Yeah, let's.

05:44.678 --> 05:46.345
Hi, my name's Lisa Text.

05:46.347 --> 05:47.579
- Wow, you're gonna do

05:47.581 --> 05:48.747
this again?
- Got your head in the phone.

05:48.749 --> 05:49.848
- Seriously, let's go.
- You're texting.

05:49.850 --> 05:51.083
You can't even see a car
- Okay Billy.

05:51.085 --> 05:51.883
- that's two feet
in front of you.

05:51.885 --> 05:53.118
'Cause you're texting.

05:53.120 --> 05:55.587
I'm texting my mom,
I'm texting my sister.

05:55.589 --> 05:57.356
I'm texting, texting, texting.

06:02.196 --> 06:03.512
Texting.

06:03.513 --> 06:04.829
That's why you don't
drive, that's why.

06:04.832 --> 06:06.898
(slamming)

06:06.900 --> 06:10.268
This is a big problem between
the both of us right now.

06:10.270 --> 06:12.904
(car starting)

06:15.075 --> 06:17.309
(revving)

06:27.054 --> 06:29.121
- It's supposed to
rain all weekend.

06:29.123 --> 06:30.655
- It's sunny out now.

06:30.657 --> 06:32.190
Why don't you keep it upbeat?

06:32.993 --> 06:34.326
How about that?

06:35.496 --> 06:37.162
(sighing)

06:37.164 --> 06:39.731
(tense music)

07:17.371 --> 07:19.004
It's been here since
I was six years old,

07:19.006 --> 07:20.338
exactly in the same spot.

07:21.642 --> 07:24.242
It's genuine cedar wood.

07:25.612 --> 07:26.711
See how smooth

07:26.713 --> 07:27.546
that second hand moves?
- Come on now

07:27.548 --> 07:28.647
let's go check in, babe.

07:28.649 --> 07:30.182
Let's go, keep going.

07:31.552 --> 07:33.618
- Mhmm, uh huh.

07:34.555 --> 07:37.589
Mhmmm.
(bell ringing)

07:37.591 --> 07:39.291
- So are you winning?

07:39.293 --> 07:40.625
- Certainly not.

07:40.627 --> 07:42.828
So are you checking in?

07:42.830 --> 07:44.262
- Yes we are indeed.

07:44.264 --> 07:45.197
- Well that's great.

07:45.199 --> 07:47.666
For the weekend or for a week?

07:47.668 --> 07:49.000
- Weekend.

07:49.002 --> 07:49.835
- Uh huh.

07:49.837 --> 07:50.802
- This is Lisa.

07:50.804 --> 07:52.037
- Hi Lisa.
- I'm Billy.

07:52.039 --> 07:52.938
Yeah I used to come
here when I was a kid.

07:52.940 --> 07:55.040
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

07:55.042 --> 07:57.809
- Do you have your
driver's license with you?

08:00.781 --> 08:01.680
Ah.

08:02.816 --> 08:06.151
Billy Curtis, hmm.

08:06.153 --> 08:10.121
- Yeah.
- Brooklyn, New York, yes.

08:10.123 --> 08:12.123
So that's quite a jog down here.

08:13.193 --> 08:14.326
What's the occasion?

08:16.063 --> 08:17.896
- Well, there's no occasion.

08:17.898 --> 08:19.698
You know, we're trying to
get away from the city.

08:19.700 --> 08:20.932
- Uh huh.

08:20.934 --> 08:24.970
- Come here, breathe
fresh air and,

08:24.972 --> 08:25.871
- And?
- And

08:25.873 --> 08:27.639
here we are.

08:27.641 --> 08:30.008
- Well, great.

08:30.010 --> 08:33.712
And I'm Frederick, not Fred.

08:33.714 --> 08:36.081
I am the innkeeper

08:36.083 --> 08:39.518
and it's very nice
to meet both of you.

08:39.520 --> 08:41.720
- Nice to meet you too.
- Good to meet you too.

08:41.722 --> 08:43.955
- So how long have you
been the innkeeper here,

08:43.957 --> 08:45.290
Frederick?
- Hmm, wow.

08:47.261 --> 08:50.061
It's 30 years, maybe
a little longer.

08:51.265 --> 08:52.764
Would you have a
credit card with you?

08:52.766 --> 08:54.366
- Yes.

08:54.368 --> 08:56.067
- Oh, thank you.

08:56.069 --> 08:58.003
It will be encrypted,
not to worry.

09:02.609 --> 09:03.909
Okay good.

09:03.911 --> 09:08.146
Now checkout will be
11 a.m. on Monday.

09:08.148 --> 09:09.481
And if you need
anything, by all means

09:09.483 --> 09:11.516
just buzz down here
to the front desk

09:11.518 --> 09:15.921
and usually be myself or
Victor the night manager.

09:15.923 --> 09:17.155
- Victor, okay.

09:17.157 --> 09:21.259
- Yes, and I have
you in room two.

09:21.261 --> 09:22.193
- Cool.

09:22.195 --> 09:24.029
- Two flights up, down the hall,

09:24.031 --> 09:26.631
you might remember
from your youth.

09:26.633 --> 09:28.633
- No, I mean I
wouldn't remember.

09:28.635 --> 09:30.969
I know that I came
here when I was a kid.

09:30.971 --> 09:32.470
I just know that my
parents took me here,

09:32.472 --> 09:33.672
here and the Elson Inn.

09:34.541 --> 09:37.175
- Ah, the Elson Inn.

09:37.177 --> 09:39.978
Yes, they tore it
down a few years ago.

09:39.980 --> 09:42.547
It was in terrible condition.

09:42.549 --> 09:45.050
And it was the oldest
inn on the island.

09:45.052 --> 09:46.484
(chuckling)

09:46.486 --> 09:48.119
- I hate it when they tear
down those old places.

09:48.121 --> 09:50.488
- Yeah well that's the
charm of this town, is it?

09:50.490 --> 09:53.291
They usually don't tear
down old landmarks.

09:53.293 --> 09:55.961
They do the very best they
can to restore them, but,

09:56.930 --> 10:00.332
time, it does take its toll.

10:00.334 --> 10:01.232
- Yeah.

10:02.970 --> 10:05.804
- So we don't have many
guests this weekend.

10:05.806 --> 10:08.306
Not yet, you know,
the weekend is young.

10:09.610 --> 10:12.344
But you never know,
things might just pick up.

10:12.346 --> 10:14.412
You never know what
tomorrow will bring.

10:15.649 --> 10:19.451
And I hope you
have a very, very,

10:19.453 --> 10:20.819
- Hup, thank you.
- Here it is.

10:20.821 --> 10:21.786
Ah, there you are,

10:21.788 --> 10:23.655
pleasant stay.
- Thank you.

10:23.657 --> 10:24.789
- Thank you.
- Two flights up,

10:24.791 --> 10:25.757
down the hall.
- Wonderful.

10:25.759 --> 10:27.392
- Welcome to use the phone.

10:27.394 --> 10:30.462
- So wonderful to meet you.
- Thanks.

10:35.268 --> 10:36.701
- That was weird.

10:36.703 --> 10:38.436
- Well it's weird,
everything's weird.

10:38.438 --> 10:39.671
Everything.

10:39.673 --> 10:41.272
The rest stop's weird,
car ride's weird.

10:41.274 --> 10:42.240
- No, the whole thing I guess,

10:42.242 --> 10:43.575
I just hope we have a nice stay.

10:43.577 --> 10:44.909
- What do you mean
the whole thing?

10:44.911 --> 10:46.711
The whole thing?

10:46.713 --> 10:48.113
What's wrong, what do you mean?

10:48.115 --> 10:49.347
What happened to
having a great time?

10:49.349 --> 10:50.615
- Are you sure we
have the right place?

10:50.617 --> 10:51.516
- No, we got the wrong
place, can't you see?

10:51.518 --> 10:52.417
It's shabby chic.

10:54.154 --> 10:56.388
You know, you're just
high maintenance, see.

10:56.390 --> 10:58.123
It's 145 years old.

11:01.294 --> 11:02.961
You're just very used
to what you're used to

11:02.963 --> 11:06.498
and anything that's out of
the ordinary is a problem.

11:07.868 --> 11:09.534
Towels on the floor.

11:09.536 --> 11:10.969
Maybe the maid has off.

11:10.971 --> 11:12.003
- [Lisa] You think?

11:15.509 --> 11:16.341
- Are you mad at me
because I told you

11:16.343 --> 11:17.509
that there'd be wifi?

11:17.511 --> 11:18.576
- [Lisa] No.

11:39.232 --> 11:40.732
- Is this all right?

11:42.235 --> 11:43.134
- Yeah.

11:44.671 --> 11:46.571
It's good to get out of town.

11:46.573 --> 11:48.106
It's a good change of scenery.

11:50.410 --> 11:53.211
And I really liked
seeing all the trees

11:53.213 --> 11:54.412
on the drive down here.

11:55.949 --> 11:57.482
- And you gotta come
with me in the fall

11:57.484 --> 11:59.684
so you can see all
the pretty colors.

11:59.686 --> 12:03.455
(bag zipping and clattering)

12:04.291 --> 12:06.925
- You know what I think?

12:06.927 --> 12:09.627
I think that you
miss being down here.

12:14.735 --> 12:16.501
- City burns me out, man.

12:16.503 --> 12:17.802
City burns me out.

12:19.172 --> 12:21.005
You handle city
better than I do.

12:23.243 --> 12:25.076
(groaning)

12:25.078 --> 12:25.944
- I don't know about that.

12:25.946 --> 12:27.178
- [Billy] Yeah?

12:27.180 --> 12:29.347
- Maybe just hide
it better than you.

12:29.349 --> 12:34.419
- Yeah I'm more like
plaid, stripes and wool.

12:35.455 --> 12:39.224
And you're more satin
and silk, black.

12:40.560 --> 12:44.629
- That's me, you
nailed it. (chuckling)

12:49.236 --> 12:50.769
- [Billy] Okay, that was odd.

12:50.771 --> 12:51.636
- What?

13:00.247 --> 13:02.881
- I was just about
to pack the drawer.

13:02.883 --> 13:04.849
It was open when
we came in here.

13:07.053 --> 13:08.119
And now it's closed.

13:09.422 --> 13:13.525
I was emptying my suitcase,
loading up the drawer

13:13.527 --> 13:14.692
and I turned around

13:14.694 --> 13:16.928
and it was closed.
- You know what I think?

13:16.930 --> 13:19.798
I think that you need
something to eat.

13:21.334 --> 13:22.767
- No, it has nothing
to do with me

13:22.769 --> 13:23.868
needing something to eat.

13:23.870 --> 13:25.503
The drawer was open.

13:28.041 --> 13:29.741
I turn around, now it's closed.

13:30.610 --> 13:32.811
- Okay so you're saying that

13:32.813 --> 13:35.713
that thing just
closed on its own?

13:36.850 --> 13:38.750
- Yeah, maybe.

13:44.991 --> 13:47.559
I'm going for a walk.

13:47.561 --> 13:49.928
- You want me to join you?

13:49.930 --> 13:54.132
- [Billy] No.

13:54.134 --> 13:57.468
- [Wispy Voice] Get
out of here, Billy.

14:10.984 --> 14:14.219
(lightly tense music)

14:27.767 --> 14:29.234
- That happens all the time.

14:31.238 --> 14:32.136
It falls.

14:33.006 --> 14:33.905
- Oh.

14:35.108 --> 14:36.975
I'm Billy from down the hall.

14:36.977 --> 14:38.710
- Hey, Billy from down the hall.

14:39.779 --> 14:40.612
Wait, wait, wait,

14:40.614 --> 14:41.546
Billy, Billy, Billy.

14:41.548 --> 14:42.547
Come and have a drink with me.

14:42.549 --> 14:43.448
Come here.

14:44.217 --> 14:45.450
I hate drinking alone.

14:50.757 --> 14:52.724
- I'm just good, thank you.

14:52.726 --> 14:53.625
- No.

14:57.998 --> 15:00.064
What should we drink to?

15:00.066 --> 15:01.599
- Strangers.

15:01.601 --> 15:03.268
- [Man] I'll drink to strangers.

15:06.706 --> 15:07.605
- You a writer?

15:08.842 --> 15:10.308
- Yeah.

15:10.310 --> 15:11.276
I was.

15:12.445 --> 15:13.378
I suppose.

15:14.481 --> 15:15.480
I wrote this.

15:17.317 --> 15:19.017
30 years ago in this room.

15:21.721 --> 15:22.787
It's an old book.

15:24.758 --> 15:26.024
Well I'm back here.

15:27.027 --> 15:28.660
Maybe I can write another one.

15:33.667 --> 15:35.300
Come here, give me.

15:35.302 --> 15:36.401
Give it back.

15:36.403 --> 15:37.735
You don't need.

15:40.240 --> 15:41.839
- [Billy] You wrote
that 30 years ago?

15:41.841 --> 15:42.740
- Yeah.

15:44.477 --> 15:45.843
Right in this room

15:47.247 --> 15:48.546
and with that typewriter.

15:49.983 --> 15:51.082
- That's 1986.

15:51.084 --> 15:53.351
- 1986, yeah.

15:54.654 --> 15:56.287
Probably when you were how old?

15:58.825 --> 15:59.958
- Six.

15:59.960 --> 16:01.893
- Long time ago, huh?

16:01.895 --> 16:03.394
- Yeah.

16:03.396 --> 16:05.163
- I think I'm back
here so I could

16:07.067 --> 16:11.102
maybe tap in whatever
that magic was.

16:12.839 --> 16:15.139
Hell, maybe you're
part of the magic.

16:15.141 --> 16:16.407
What are you doing here?

16:17.410 --> 16:18.643
- I'm here with my girlfriend.

16:18.645 --> 16:19.444
- Yeah?

16:19.446 --> 16:20.611
What's her name?

16:20.613 --> 16:22.580
- Lisa.
- Lisa?

16:22.582 --> 16:23.514
Are you in love?

16:26.486 --> 16:28.152
- I don't know.

16:28.154 --> 16:30.054
- You don't know?

16:30.056 --> 16:31.823
Love is a beautiful thing.

16:32.926 --> 16:34.892
Well you'll have to
bring Lisa back up

16:34.894 --> 16:35.860
and have a drink with me.

16:35.862 --> 16:37.161
Will you do that?

16:37.163 --> 16:38.496
- That's a possibility.

16:44.904 --> 16:47.038
(exhaling)

16:47.040 --> 16:48.573
Wow, that just really hit me.

16:50.610 --> 16:51.576
- Are you okay?

16:51.578 --> 16:53.044
- Yeah.

16:53.046 --> 16:56.981
I just gotta get back
to my girlfriend.

16:58.018 --> 16:59.784
I'm gonna head out.

17:00.987 --> 17:03.087
But thanks for inviting
me into your place,

17:03.089 --> 17:04.956
appreciate that, and the drink.

17:06.726 --> 17:07.625
- [Writer] Nice
meeting you, Billy.

17:07.627 --> 17:09.494
- Nice meeting you too.

17:09.496 --> 17:11.262
- Come back, all right?

17:11.264 --> 17:12.163
With Lisa though.

17:13.366 --> 17:15.366
Only with Lisa.

17:27.280 --> 17:29.514
(sighing)

17:41.294 --> 17:43.594
(creaking)

17:46.666 --> 17:48.433
- [Lisa] Everything all right?

17:48.435 --> 17:49.333
- Yeah.

17:50.970 --> 17:51.869
It's good.

17:56.176 --> 17:57.809
That guy was weird.

17:59.345 --> 18:00.244
- What's weird?

18:01.614 --> 18:03.981
- This writer, I met this
writer down the hallway.

18:03.983 --> 18:05.850
He's really strange.

18:09.789 --> 18:10.688
- Hmm.

18:11.825 --> 18:15.293
- He like invited
me to his room.

18:18.498 --> 18:20.665
And he like made me a
drink and he's talking.

18:21.434 --> 18:23.301
It's really strange.

18:24.637 --> 18:27.205
- Baby, is that what
you're wearing to dinner?

18:29.876 --> 18:31.242
- (sighing) Yes.

18:31.244 --> 18:32.910
- Well hey, I'm
really, really hungry

18:32.912 --> 18:34.512
so let's go eat soon, okay?

18:37.417 --> 18:40.785
What are you doing,
stop. (giggling)

18:49.095 --> 18:50.761
Get ready.

18:50.763 --> 18:51.896
- I am ready.

18:53.800 --> 18:56.134
Did you leave the drawer open?

18:56.136 --> 18:58.002
- [Lisa] Ugh, again
with the drawer?

19:06.012 --> 19:08.846
(steps thumping)

19:13.887 --> 19:16.120
(sighing)

19:21.094 --> 19:23.828
(clock ticking)

19:25.398 --> 19:26.931
(floor creaking)

19:26.933 --> 19:27.832
- Hey Frederick.

19:28.668 --> 19:29.734
- Evening, Billy.

19:30.870 --> 19:33.004
- Your grandfather
clock is wrong.

19:33.006 --> 19:33.838
- What do you mean?

19:33.840 --> 19:35.006
- It says 7:15.

19:35.008 --> 19:36.941
- So it must be 7:15.

19:36.943 --> 19:38.442
- Nah, it can't be 7:15.

19:39.479 --> 19:41.379
- But it's never been
wrong in 20 years.

19:41.381 --> 19:43.080
- My Rolex says 6:15.

19:43.082 --> 19:44.282
- Oh that may be a Rolex, Billy,

19:44.284 --> 19:45.950
but that's an Imperial and

19:47.787 --> 19:49.921
I have been watching it for,

19:49.923 --> 19:50.855
it's impossible.
- Frederick.

19:50.857 --> 19:51.789
- They don't break.

19:51.791 --> 19:53.391
- Frederick, it's a Rolex.

19:53.393 --> 19:54.625
Rolexes are never wrong.

19:54.627 --> 19:55.660
- Well maybe it
needs to be reset.

19:55.662 --> 19:56.861
- No, it doesn't.

19:56.863 --> 19:58.162
- Where are you going
with this, Billy?

19:58.164 --> 19:59.730
- I'm not going
anywhere with it.

19:59.732 --> 20:01.866
I'm just saying, this,
my Rolex says 6:15.

20:01.868 --> 20:02.733
- Okay.
- I was only there

20:02.735 --> 20:03.968
for two hours.

20:03.970 --> 20:04.969
- So what's the point?
- The grandfather clock

20:04.971 --> 20:05.903
is wrong.

20:05.905 --> 20:07.371
Maybe you should reset it.

20:07.373 --> 20:09.674
- Hi Lisa, Billy and I were
just talking about time.

20:09.676 --> 20:12.410
- Were we up there
for two hours?

20:12.412 --> 20:13.744
No, of course not.

20:14.847 --> 20:16.647
He's trying to tell
me that it's 7:15.

20:17.450 --> 20:21.018
But my Rolex says 6:15.

20:21.020 --> 20:23.287
Who's right?
- No that says 7:15.

20:23.289 --> 20:25.923
- And Mr. Curtis?
- No it's not.

20:25.925 --> 20:28.960
- My watch also says 7:15.

20:28.962 --> 20:30.461
- Yup, 7:15.

20:30.463 --> 20:31.796
Well thank you so
much, Frederick.

20:31.798 --> 20:32.830
We appreciate that.

20:33.800 --> 20:34.732
Baby, let's go.

20:34.734 --> 20:36.567
- May I make a suggestion?

20:36.569 --> 20:37.768
- Absolutely.

20:37.770 --> 20:39.537
- There's a lovely
restaurant just about

20:39.539 --> 20:41.405
two blocks from
here, the Lambs Head.

20:42.375 --> 20:43.474
- What a name.

20:43.476 --> 20:44.942
- Yes.

20:44.944 --> 20:46.711
Good name, good food.

20:46.713 --> 20:47.845
- Thank you, Frederick.

20:47.847 --> 20:48.813
- Enjoy, night.

20:48.815 --> 20:50.948
- We will, thank you so much.

20:54.988 --> 20:55.853
- Hmm.

21:01.194 --> 21:04.895
(light rock music)

21:04.897 --> 21:05.930
- This is a nice place.

21:22.415 --> 21:24.382
What's going on in
that head of yours?

21:26.953 --> 21:28.119
- I feel a little weird.

21:28.988 --> 21:29.887
- Okay.

21:30.990 --> 21:32.323
Why do you feel weird?

21:36.296 --> 21:38.929
- Ever since that
incident, I just, well.

21:42.402 --> 21:44.035
- Billy what?
- I feel weird.

21:44.037 --> 21:45.870
- Okay, okay.

21:45.872 --> 21:46.771
Which incident?

21:50.076 --> 21:51.208
- At the rest stop.

21:52.578 --> 21:54.979
With that guy and
then at the hotel room

21:54.981 --> 21:56.247
with the drawer.

21:56.249 --> 21:59.483
And now this thing
with the watch.

22:03.289 --> 22:04.221
Look.

22:05.024 --> 22:06.290
When you were getting ready,

22:06.292 --> 22:07.658
I came down the stairs

22:07.660 --> 22:09.627
and I was waiting for you

22:09.629 --> 22:12.196
so I admired the
grandfather clock.

22:12.198 --> 22:15.866
And I noticed, oh
look it says 7:15.

22:15.868 --> 22:19.236
And I noticed that
my watch says 6:15.

22:19.238 --> 22:21.105
This is a fucking Rolex.

22:23.743 --> 22:26.577
That's what we were talking
about, Frederick and I.

22:26.579 --> 22:29.547
And then you come down, and,

22:31.050 --> 22:34.652
I mean you know how much
pride I have in this watch.

22:34.654 --> 22:37.621
And you contradicted me
in front of the stranger.

22:37.623 --> 22:39.190
I couldn't believe it.

22:39.192 --> 22:42.460
You like totally threw
me under the bus.

22:44.630 --> 22:47.198
I mean I didn't feel
like you had my back.

22:47.200 --> 22:50.134
I just feel like that
I've been telling you

22:51.170 --> 22:53.504
all these things
that I feel like

22:53.506 --> 22:54.972
that are happening to me

22:54.974 --> 22:55.806
and you don't believe me

22:55.808 --> 22:57.007
and you think I'm crazy.

23:01.581 --> 23:02.780
I feel like I'm alone.

23:04.317 --> 23:05.816
I don't feel like we're a team,

23:05.818 --> 23:07.985
I don't feel like we're
partners in crime.

23:11.924 --> 23:12.890
I feel alone.

23:21.000 --> 23:23.234
(sighing)

23:23.236 --> 23:24.301
- You're not crazy.

23:26.172 --> 23:27.605
I don't think you're crazy.

23:30.276 --> 23:32.309
Listen, look at me.

23:35.381 --> 23:37.148
I know that's your
father's watch

23:37.150 --> 23:38.516
and it means a lot to you.

23:42.822 --> 23:46.157
And Billy, I have
your back, I promise.

23:48.361 --> 23:49.527
I'm sorry.

23:49.529 --> 23:51.695
I'm sorry for not having
your back earlier.

23:51.697 --> 23:52.763
- No I mean,

23:52.765 --> 23:53.564
I get a little nutty.
- No, no.

23:53.566 --> 23:54.498
- I get nutty too.

23:54.500 --> 23:56.033
I understand and I'm sorry.

23:58.938 --> 23:59.904
- Everybody gets nutty.

23:59.906 --> 24:00.871
I get nutty, you get nutty.

24:00.873 --> 24:02.473
Who cares, we all get nutty.

24:02.475 --> 24:05.042
We're human beings, we're crazy.

24:07.213 --> 24:11.382
Why don't we just have a really
romantic weekend together?

24:13.519 --> 24:15.352
What, why are you laughing?

25:44.443 --> 25:46.010
- Where you going?

25:59.825 --> 26:02.560
(door shutting)

26:10.436 --> 26:12.403
(clinking)

26:12.405 --> 26:14.038
I should just ask her.

26:14.040 --> 26:15.406
Ask her nicely.

26:16.842 --> 26:18.576
And if she gets defensive,

26:19.679 --> 26:22.279
then you know
there's something up.

26:36.562 --> 26:37.695
Just ask her.

26:38.931 --> 26:43.767
Say, is that your mom
you're talking to?

26:44.737 --> 26:45.903
Just ask her.

26:47.807 --> 26:48.872
(knocking)

26:48.874 --> 26:50.107
- [Lisa] Yes?

26:50.109 --> 26:52.710
- [Billy] What are
you doing in there?

26:52.712 --> 26:53.811
- I'm taking my bath.

26:54.614 --> 26:55.779
- Yeah I know, but why,

26:55.781 --> 26:57.247
why did you bring the phone?

26:58.317 --> 27:01.318
- Because I need to
check my text messages.

27:13.833 --> 27:16.634
(sighing)

27:16.636 --> 27:19.203
(tense music)

28:08.487 --> 28:11.889
- [Man] Sounds like
my mother. (laughing)

28:12.758 --> 28:13.824
Come on, man!

28:14.860 --> 28:16.794
What the fuck!

28:16.796 --> 28:18.562
- [Man] He's out for a
nice Saturday night stroll.

28:20.132 --> 28:23.033
(laughing)

28:23.035 --> 28:24.935
You throw like a girl.

28:26.038 --> 28:29.006
- [Man] What, he just
fucking wave at me?

28:29.008 --> 28:30.741
- [Man] Looks like
he gave you the bird.

28:31.944 --> 28:32.843
Take that shit?

28:38.117 --> 28:40.017
There's our little
friend, come here.

28:41.153 --> 28:42.953
Such a cute little car.

28:42.955 --> 28:43.854
Come on.

28:45.291 --> 28:46.924
Move, motherfucker!

28:49.028 --> 28:50.260
Hand me a beer, man.

28:50.262 --> 28:52.296
Hand me another
fucking beer, man.

28:52.298 --> 28:54.198
Ah yeah, there you go.

28:57.636 --> 28:58.802
- [Man] Yeah?

28:59.905 --> 29:00.571
Wait, wait, here
we go, here we go,

29:00.573 --> 29:01.672
what we got?

29:01.674 --> 29:03.540
(laughing)

29:03.542 --> 29:05.776
Is he gonna get out the car?

29:05.778 --> 29:07.277
See if he gets down
the fucking car.

29:07.279 --> 29:08.712
What you do, come
on, motherfucker.

29:08.714 --> 29:10.414
Is he gonna get out?

29:10.416 --> 29:12.483
- What's wrong, asshole?

29:14.420 --> 29:16.253
- [Man] He just
made a bad mistake.

29:17.490 --> 29:18.722
- Fucking piece of shit!

29:18.724 --> 29:19.957
Fucking on me!

29:19.959 --> 29:21.792
- [Man] Oh, he's
not gonna like that.

29:24.430 --> 29:25.696
- [Man] Come on, let's
get him right now.

29:25.698 --> 29:27.898
Ready, come on.

29:27.900 --> 29:29.466
Oh we're gonna follow him.

29:29.468 --> 29:31.535
See that fucking girl
he had in the car?

29:31.537 --> 29:32.903
See that fucking woman?

29:32.905 --> 29:34.905
Oh man!
- Let's go get some.

29:34.907 --> 29:36.340
- Yeah!

29:36.342 --> 29:38.308
That fucking woman.

29:38.310 --> 29:40.410
I'm gonna fuck her
and make him watch.

29:40.412 --> 29:42.746
(whirring)

30:00.432 --> 30:03.167
(door creaking)

30:29.428 --> 30:34.498
(man laughing)
(woman screaming)

30:38.604 --> 30:39.970
(screaming)

30:39.972 --> 30:41.171
- Come here!

30:41.173 --> 30:42.039
Come here!

30:44.343 --> 30:45.642
She likes it!

30:45.644 --> 30:46.910
She likes it. (laughing)

30:46.912 --> 30:48.312
(screaming)

30:48.314 --> 30:50.981
Yeah, yeah.

30:50.983 --> 30:52.749
Come here, come here.

30:54.320 --> 30:56.520
(woman sobbing)

30:56.522 --> 30:58.021
Like that?

30:58.023 --> 30:58.889
Get it!

31:01.927 --> 31:04.628
(woman sobbing)

31:11.871 --> 31:14.204
(groaning)

31:25.718 --> 31:28.285
(tense music)

31:33.559 --> 31:35.092
- (shivering) The fuck is that?!

31:35.094 --> 31:36.593
The fuck is that?

31:43.235 --> 31:45.302
(hyperventilating)

31:45.304 --> 31:46.703
What the fuck is this?

31:46.705 --> 31:47.905
What the fuck?

31:49.541 --> 31:52.075
(tense music)

32:18.671 --> 32:21.738
- Is everything all
right out there?

32:23.943 --> 32:25.809
Is everything all right?

32:25.811 --> 32:27.311
- Yeah.

32:27.313 --> 32:28.545
What the fuck?

32:31.116 --> 32:33.417
(exhaling)

33:27.706 --> 33:29.172
- [Lisa] Miss me?

33:43.922 --> 33:46.189
(sighing)

34:00.105 --> 34:02.806
(water gushing)

34:24.763 --> 34:26.229
What are you doing?

34:26.231 --> 34:28.698
- I have something in my eye.

34:42.081 --> 34:44.648
(tense music)

34:50.456 --> 34:52.856
(screaming)

35:04.770 --> 35:06.236
- You're acting weird again.

35:14.646 --> 35:16.880
(moaning)

35:55.988 --> 35:57.254
- [Billy] Okay,
I'm a little tired.

35:57.256 --> 35:59.189
I can't do this right now.

36:05.230 --> 36:07.164
- It's okay, it's okay.

36:08.500 --> 36:11.168
It's okay baby, we got
a whole weekend, okay?

36:11.170 --> 36:14.237
(thudding in distance)

36:14.239 --> 36:15.205
Did you hear that?

36:20.379 --> 36:23.713
Billy, can you go
check on the sound?

36:26.852 --> 36:27.751
- Yeah.

36:28.587 --> 36:30.220
(eerie music)

36:30.222 --> 36:32.956
(door creaking)

37:54.840 --> 37:57.907
(tense eerie music)

38:35.147 --> 38:37.947
(birds chirping)

39:07.846 --> 39:10.080
(sighing)

39:24.529 --> 39:27.263
(door creaking)

39:36.408 --> 39:38.708
(groaning)

39:51.022 --> 39:51.921
Lisa.

40:48.146 --> 40:49.446
Fucking phone!

40:52.751 --> 40:54.951
(banging)

41:06.498 --> 41:08.731
(sighing)

41:13.705 --> 41:16.439
- Yes, yes, I know
that, Mrs. Douglas.

41:16.441 --> 41:18.842
Yeah it's 135 for the
night during the week

41:18.844 --> 41:20.810
and then the price
changes on the weekend.

41:20.812 --> 41:22.011
And then you're coming--

41:22.013 --> 41:22.812
- I need to use the
phone for a bit.

41:22.814 --> 41:24.047
I need to use the phone.

41:24.049 --> 41:25.281
- Just a minute, please.

41:25.283 --> 41:26.316
- [Billy] I need to
make a phone call.

41:26.318 --> 41:27.784
- Okay, yeah okay.

41:27.786 --> 41:30.587
Thank you and please,
just let me know.

41:30.589 --> 41:31.588
Bye.

41:31.590 --> 41:33.490
It's not even 9:30 a.m.

41:33.492 --> 41:34.757
and the phone is ringing off
- I need to use the phone.

41:34.759 --> 41:36.025
- and I can't seem
to please anybody.

41:36.027 --> 41:36.960
Yeah you know what--

41:36.962 --> 41:37.961
- [Billy] Can I use the phone?

41:37.963 --> 41:39.195
- Yes, I said you could.
- Okay.

41:39.197 --> 41:40.363
Thank you.
- Now who do you wanna call?

41:40.365 --> 41:41.030
- [Billy] I'm
calling the police.

41:41.032 --> 41:42.232
- What, what?

41:42.234 --> 41:43.399
My goodness, why are
you calling the police?

41:43.401 --> 41:44.634
- 'Cause it's a personal
matter, Frederick.

41:44.636 --> 41:46.169
- [Frederick] No I
think I should know.

41:46.171 --> 41:47.103
Don't you think I should
know what's going on here?

41:47.105 --> 41:49.239
Are you having them come here?

41:49.241 --> 41:50.473
- And I'm staying
at the Doctor's Inn

41:50.475 --> 41:52.208
and I need a
detective to come by.

41:53.445 --> 41:55.545
No, it's not an emergency but

41:56.448 --> 41:58.481
it's extremely important.

41:58.483 --> 41:59.983
I need a detective to come over

41:59.985 --> 42:01.451
to Doctor's Inn right away

42:01.453 --> 42:04.721
'cause I have something
that I need to show him.

42:08.159 --> 42:10.293
It's confidential.

42:11.530 --> 42:13.830
(mumbling)

42:14.966 --> 42:15.865
Okay, thank you.

42:18.436 --> 42:21.104
- Now is there
something I do to help?

42:21.106 --> 42:23.072
- I'm gonna be out
on the front porch.

42:25.544 --> 42:28.344
(birds chirping)

42:32.684 --> 42:34.918
(revving)

42:50.669 --> 42:51.601
Detective?

42:51.603 --> 42:53.736
- Yeah, yeah, Detective Mueller.

42:53.738 --> 42:54.604
Billy Curtis?

42:54.606 --> 42:55.438
- Billy Curtis.

42:55.440 --> 42:56.506
I called you.

42:56.508 --> 42:57.807
- What can I help you with?

42:57.809 --> 43:00.577
- Well I found something
that's very disturbing.

43:01.546 --> 43:03.112
- What is it?

43:03.114 --> 43:05.281
- It's a videotape and I just
don't know what to make of it.

43:05.283 --> 43:08.518
I don't know if it's
real or if it's not.

43:08.520 --> 43:10.853
It's very disturbing.

43:10.855 --> 43:12.655
- Okay, all right.

43:12.657 --> 43:13.790
Let me take a little information

43:13.792 --> 43:14.857
before we step inside, huh?

43:17.929 --> 43:18.778
- [Billy] Sure.

43:18.779 --> 43:19.628
- [Mueller] You from
this area, Billy?

43:19.631 --> 43:21.497
- No, I'm from New York.

43:21.499 --> 43:23.333
I'm just here for the
weekend with my girlfriend.

43:23.335 --> 43:24.167
- She inside?

43:24.169 --> 43:25.435
- No, she's at a cafe.

43:26.538 --> 43:28.705
- And when did you
find this tape?

43:28.707 --> 43:31.074
- [Billy] Last night in
my room, after dinner.

43:31.977 --> 43:33.543
- Okay.

43:33.545 --> 43:34.677
- What's on the tape?

43:39.217 --> 43:40.617
- [Billy] I'd rather show you.

43:42.621 --> 43:43.987
- Sure.

43:43.989 --> 43:45.421
Let's take a look.
- Okay.

44:21.459 --> 44:22.358
It's gone.

44:24.663 --> 44:26.029
No I don't understand.

44:26.031 --> 44:29.332
I put it right here, I
put it in here before.

44:30.201 --> 44:31.134
I don't understand this.

44:31.136 --> 44:32.635
I put it right in there.

44:32.637 --> 44:35.138
- Billy, Billy, relax.

44:35.140 --> 44:36.272
Maybe you put it somewhere else.

44:36.274 --> 44:37.774
Another drawer maybe?

44:37.776 --> 44:39.075
- I put it here.

44:41.680 --> 44:42.745
- Okay, well listen.

44:44.215 --> 44:46.249
Tell me exactly what
was on this tape.

44:47.052 --> 44:48.551
- A guy and a girl

44:48.553 --> 44:52.255
and there was men, two men
that were chasing them.

44:52.257 --> 44:54.357
And they were videotaping them.

44:54.359 --> 44:57.093
And this altercation occurred

44:57.095 --> 45:00.530
and then it continued
into this room

45:00.532 --> 45:04.200
with the couple, and
they busted the door down

45:05.603 --> 45:06.669
and they killed them.

45:07.972 --> 45:09.338
They killed them.

45:09.340 --> 45:10.606
- They killed them, huh?

45:10.608 --> 45:12.141
- [Billy] Yeah.

45:12.143 --> 45:13.443
- And you're sure about that?

45:14.446 --> 45:18.147
- Oh, yeah, I'm sure about it.

45:18.149 --> 45:20.083
Well they didn't kill them.

45:20.085 --> 45:21.984
It was the guy with the
video camera just taped it.

45:21.986 --> 45:23.352
The other guy killed them.

45:24.556 --> 45:25.455
- Okay.

45:26.324 --> 45:27.523
How did he kill them?

45:27.525 --> 45:28.424
- With a knife.

45:29.894 --> 45:31.561
- And you're certain about that?

45:32.597 --> 45:33.930
- Detective, I wouldn't
call you over here

45:33.932 --> 45:35.364
if I didn't see
with my own eyes.

45:35.366 --> 45:37.100
I wouldn't waste your time.

45:37.102 --> 45:38.568
And believe me I'd
much rather be over

45:38.570 --> 45:40.903
with my girlfriend having
a coffee right now.

45:47.879 --> 45:49.078
Does this ring a bell?

45:50.582 --> 45:51.948
- No, not really.

45:53.752 --> 45:55.284
And you're sure it was here?

45:55.286 --> 45:57.320
- Oh yeah it was in this room.

45:57.322 --> 45:59.322
The door, the
number on the door,

45:59.324 --> 46:00.256
you could see it.

46:04.729 --> 46:07.163
- These two guys
in the videotape.

46:08.099 --> 46:09.265
What'd they look like?

46:11.002 --> 46:13.302
- The guy shooting it, I
didn't see much of him.

46:13.304 --> 46:17.006
But the other guy, the
guy who did the killing,

46:17.008 --> 46:20.610
he had this, he
was in the shadows.

46:24.249 --> 46:25.481
- Okay, okay, okay.

46:25.483 --> 46:27.216
Where exactly did
you find this tape?

46:28.052 --> 46:28.951
- Under the bed.

46:31.322 --> 46:32.722
- Under the bed?

46:32.724 --> 46:35.258
- Yeah, my girlfriend
was taking a bath

46:35.260 --> 46:36.759
then I was gonna
smoke a cigarette

46:36.761 --> 46:38.561
then I dropped the matches.

46:38.563 --> 46:41.097
And I went to pick them
up and then there it was.

46:42.066 --> 46:43.099
Just under the bed.

46:44.602 --> 46:45.735
- Did you show your girlfriend?

46:45.737 --> 46:46.636
- [Billy] No.

46:47.539 --> 46:49.038
- Why not?

46:49.040 --> 46:51.340
- Because it was horrific and
I didn't want to scare her.

46:55.680 --> 46:57.413
(sighing)

46:57.415 --> 46:59.916
- Look, Billy.

47:01.286 --> 47:02.752
There's not much more I can do

47:02.754 --> 47:04.921
until I see this tape.

47:04.923 --> 47:06.088
- (sighing) No,
I understand that

47:06.090 --> 47:08.057
but this doesn't ring a bell,

47:08.059 --> 47:09.859
or it's not familiar?

47:09.861 --> 47:12.962
A murdered couple, you've
never heard that before?

47:13.865 --> 47:15.131
- I can't say that it does.

47:15.133 --> 47:18.000
I mean, this is a
small resort town.

47:18.002 --> 47:20.770
We got three detectives,
uniformed police.

47:21.873 --> 47:24.373
There's not a lot
of crime, you know.

47:24.375 --> 47:26.142
I mean in the summers we got

47:27.245 --> 47:28.711
kids that are getting
rowdy in the clubs,

47:28.713 --> 47:31.280
you know, breaking up
fights, things like that.

47:31.282 --> 47:33.449
There's a car or a house
that gets broken into

47:33.451 --> 47:37.420
but other than that it's
a really quiet town.

47:37.422 --> 47:39.222
- So no murders?

47:39.224 --> 47:41.824
- (chuckling) No, no murders.

47:41.826 --> 47:44.193
I mean, not that I'm aware of.

47:44.195 --> 47:46.762
I've only been in this
precinct a very short time.

47:49.267 --> 47:53.102
(sighing) But anyhow.

47:54.873 --> 47:55.771
Here's my card.

47:58.877 --> 48:02.511
If you find the videotape,
just let me know.

48:03.615 --> 48:05.114
- Okay.

48:05.116 --> 48:07.250
I'm sorry I had you come here

48:07.252 --> 48:09.352
and waste your time, Detective.

48:09.354 --> 48:11.254
I appreciate it.

48:11.256 --> 48:13.055
- You didn't waste my time.

48:13.057 --> 48:15.258
Try to enjoy the
rest of your stay.

48:15.260 --> 48:16.158
- I'll try.

48:19.430 --> 48:22.164
(door creaking)

48:26.704 --> 48:31.507
- No, I'm happy to hold a
reservation for 48 hours.

48:31.509 --> 48:33.843
No, the pleasure's always mine.

48:35.680 --> 48:36.579
Goodbye.

48:40.618 --> 48:43.419
(floor creaking)

48:46.157 --> 48:48.024
Ah, Billy.

48:48.860 --> 48:50.726
I hope everything's all right.

48:50.728 --> 48:53.195
- No, it's not all right.

48:54.232 --> 48:55.331
- What's the problem?

48:56.668 --> 48:57.566
- Well.

49:00.238 --> 49:04.607
There's a tape that's
missing from my room.

49:04.609 --> 49:06.375
- A tape?
- A video tape.

49:07.612 --> 49:09.745
So what about it?
- I found a video tape

49:09.747 --> 49:11.347
in my room.

49:11.349 --> 49:13.049
And now it's gone missing.

49:13.051 --> 49:13.883
- Missing?

49:13.885 --> 49:14.784
- Yes.

49:16.587 --> 49:18.688
- Well I don't know
how to help you.

49:20.224 --> 49:22.224
It's barely 10 a.m.

49:22.226 --> 49:23.459
No one's been in your room.

49:23.461 --> 49:24.660
- No one has come in my room?

49:24.662 --> 49:26.262
- No.

49:26.264 --> 49:27.163
- No one?

49:27.165 --> 49:27.997
- No, of course it's--

49:27.999 --> 49:29.031
- Not even a maid?

49:29.834 --> 49:31.300
- We have a maid, it's Peggy,

49:31.302 --> 49:34.437
but she doesn't
come too much later

49:34.439 --> 49:36.572
till after checkout time.

49:36.574 --> 49:38.874
And even after that,

49:40.278 --> 49:44.680
she changes the linen and
brings fresh towels, yes,

49:44.682 --> 49:47.283
but she won't be
over quite some time.

49:48.753 --> 49:51.187
Billy, I'm sorry, I don't
think I can help you.

50:14.912 --> 50:17.146
(sighing)

50:34.832 --> 50:35.898
- Am I late?

50:37.902 --> 50:40.069
- It's 10:30, where were you?

50:45.276 --> 50:46.509
- Why don't you give me a break

50:46.511 --> 50:47.910
and let's have some fun?

50:49.680 --> 50:52.014
- Yay, I'm all for fun.

50:54.685 --> 50:56.185
- Let's have a good
time, you know?

51:00.158 --> 51:01.791
What do you wanna do?

51:01.793 --> 51:03.025
- I don't know, Billy.

51:03.027 --> 51:04.160
You're the tour
guide, you tell me.

51:05.463 --> 51:07.063
What are we gonna do?

51:09.801 --> 51:11.434
- I say we take a ride into town

51:11.436 --> 51:13.569
and then hot chocolate and then
we'll go to the lighthouse.

51:18.709 --> 51:19.942
- [Lisa] Okay.

51:39.530 --> 51:41.864
(coughing)

51:43.501 --> 51:45.734
(sighing)

51:49.740 --> 51:52.908
(somber music)

51:52.910 --> 51:55.211
(giggling)

52:04.989 --> 52:06.856
- Where are you going?

52:26.010 --> 52:30.646
- We have just taken 228
steps to get up here.

52:30.648 --> 52:33.449
The lighthouse is a
total of 171 feet.

52:34.519 --> 52:36.886
Now some of you may
know of the SS Atlantis

52:36.888 --> 52:39.321
but if you look far
enough to the south,

52:39.323 --> 52:41.090
you'll spot a piece of the hull

52:41.092 --> 52:43.726
from the obscure
Sir Edmond James

52:43.728 --> 52:47.496
which fell victim to a
shipwreck here in 1899.

52:47.498 --> 52:49.798
It was on its way to
China carrying freight

52:49.800 --> 52:51.767
when it ran into a dense fog

52:51.769 --> 52:54.904
which ultimately
led to its demise.

52:54.906 --> 52:56.305
- Wow.

52:56.307 --> 52:58.440
Were there any survivors?

52:58.442 --> 52:59.942
- As a matter of fact, yes.

52:59.944 --> 53:03.112
The Captain, Edward Louis
was the only survivor.

53:03.114 --> 53:05.381
The rest of his
crew, nine men total,

53:05.383 --> 53:06.849
met their fate that night.

53:06.851 --> 53:07.750
- Wow.

53:08.953 --> 53:10.986
What happened to the Captain?

53:10.988 --> 53:12.254
- Funny you mentioned.

53:12.256 --> 53:13.756
He swam ashore and was
nursed back to health

53:13.758 --> 53:14.990
at the Doctor's Inn

53:14.992 --> 53:16.559
which was the first
place he stumbled upon

53:16.561 --> 53:17.960
on that rainy night.

53:17.962 --> 53:21.764
A few years later, he
became the innkeeper there.

53:21.766 --> 53:23.199
- Great, we're staying
at the Doctor's Inn.

53:23.201 --> 53:25.601
- Well, it's a lovely place.

53:25.603 --> 53:27.836
But it certainly has a history.

53:27.838 --> 53:29.305
- What kind of history?

53:29.307 --> 53:31.840
- Some say there are some
haunted areas in town,

53:31.842 --> 53:33.809
the Doctor's Inn
being one of them.

53:33.811 --> 53:34.677
- Are there any others?

53:34.679 --> 53:36.612
- Oh there are several.

53:37.715 --> 53:40.282
There's a ghost tour
if you're interested.

53:40.284 --> 53:42.051
- Oh god, I love ghost tours.

53:42.053 --> 53:44.486
- No, I don't wanna, no.

53:44.488 --> 53:45.955
I'm not gonna go
on a ghost tour.

53:45.957 --> 53:47.156
- I'm gonna keep this.
- I don't think so.

53:47.158 --> 53:49.959
I don't wanna go
to a ghost tour.

53:56.367 --> 53:58.133
Thanks for showing
us the lighthouse.

53:58.135 --> 53:59.635
- My pleasure.

53:59.637 --> 54:01.637
- You must really love it
to walk up all those stairs.

54:01.639 --> 54:02.638
- Yeah.

54:02.640 --> 54:04.440
I'm a real people person.

54:04.442 --> 54:06.775
Plus the stairs give
me a good workout.

54:06.777 --> 54:09.078
- So how long you've
been doing this for?

54:09.080 --> 54:10.412
- Let's see.

54:10.414 --> 54:13.282
I've been here part
time after I got out

54:13.284 --> 54:15.684
of the service in 1981.

54:15.686 --> 54:17.152
- [Billy] What, the Navy?

54:19.156 --> 54:19.788
- That's right.

54:19.789 --> 54:20.421
I've had some odd
jobs over the years

54:20.424 --> 54:22.891
but I've been here
full time since 1995.

54:22.893 --> 54:24.026
- That's a long time.

54:28.332 --> 54:31.967
Let me ask you, did you
really believe in this

54:31.969 --> 54:33.302
ghost stuff, like?

54:33.304 --> 54:35.104
Is the Doctor's
Inn really haunted?

54:35.973 --> 54:37.172
- It's folklore.

54:38.309 --> 54:40.175
It's also part of the tour.

54:40.177 --> 54:41.410
Helps the economy.

54:41.412 --> 54:43.112
People like that sort of thing.

54:43.114 --> 54:44.146
- That makes sense.

54:45.249 --> 54:46.282
My parents used
to bring me there

54:46.284 --> 54:48.183
when I was little.

54:48.185 --> 54:49.718
- So beautiful.

54:49.720 --> 54:52.421
Charles, are there
any bathrooms up here?

54:52.423 --> 54:55.024
- [Charles] Oh, sure, let
me take you down there.

54:55.026 --> 54:56.592
- Okay.

54:56.594 --> 54:58.060
- [Charles] Watch your step.

55:01.866 --> 55:03.098
So how long will you be staying

55:03.100 --> 55:04.733
at the Doctor's Inn?

55:04.735 --> 55:06.602
- Like three days.

55:06.604 --> 55:11.473
We just got here yesterday.

55:11.475 --> 55:13.309
Ooh, we got new towels, baby.

55:14.745 --> 55:16.278
- Oh, I love fresh towels.

55:18.883 --> 55:22.051
- I am going to take a bath.

55:22.053 --> 55:23.585
- No, no, take a shower.

55:23.587 --> 55:24.853
Take a bath later.

55:24.855 --> 55:26.822
Just rinse off, no ordeal.

55:26.824 --> 55:28.724
- [Lisa] Fine.

55:28.726 --> 55:30.859
Hey baby, where are
we gonna go eat?

55:31.996 --> 55:33.896
- I feel like seafood.

55:33.898 --> 55:34.897
(tense music)

55:34.899 --> 55:36.131
- [Lisa] Okay.

55:52.583 --> 55:54.016
(knocking)

55:54.018 --> 55:55.250
- [Billy] I'll be back.

55:56.153 --> 55:57.052
- Billy.

55:57.955 --> 56:00.522
(tense music)

56:10.034 --> 56:11.400
(sighing)

56:11.402 --> 56:13.268
- Detective, I got the tape!

56:14.205 --> 56:15.504
I got the tape.

56:16.974 --> 56:18.040
- Hey listen, Billy.

56:19.176 --> 56:20.109
I'm done for the day.

56:20.111 --> 56:21.577
I'm just about to leave, okay?

56:21.579 --> 56:23.379
- It's the tape.

56:23.381 --> 56:24.980
- It's after five.

56:24.982 --> 56:26.415
- Please.

56:26.417 --> 56:28.217
This is the tape, please.

56:29.320 --> 56:30.919
- All right, all
right, come on in.

56:43.868 --> 56:46.835
So, where'd you find the tape?

56:46.837 --> 56:47.736
- It popped up.

56:50.474 --> 56:52.574
I'm telling you
Detective, it popped up.

56:53.444 --> 56:54.376
- Popped up, huh?

56:54.378 --> 56:55.844
- Right in the dresser drawer.

57:00.351 --> 57:01.683
I'm telling you, there's
a lot of weird stuff

57:01.685 --> 57:03.252
going on right now, Detective.

57:04.188 --> 57:06.221
- Okay, well let's have a look.

57:10.327 --> 57:12.561
(sighing)

57:16.634 --> 57:18.867
(sighing)

57:23.541 --> 57:25.474
What's going on,
where's the picture?

57:26.610 --> 57:27.810
- Press forward.

57:27.812 --> 57:28.944
- [Mueller] I'm
fast forwarding it.

57:30.114 --> 57:31.013
- Press play.

57:31.949 --> 57:33.215
- Look.

57:33.217 --> 57:34.683
I'm pressing rewind,

57:34.685 --> 57:35.617
fast forward.
- I don't know.

57:35.619 --> 57:36.952
I'm not making it up, Detective.

57:36.954 --> 57:38.020
- I'm pressing play.

57:38.022 --> 57:39.254
This is crazy, Billy.
- I know.

57:39.256 --> 57:40.622
I put it on there,
I saw the tape,

57:40.624 --> 57:41.557
I saw with my own eyes.

57:41.559 --> 57:42.791
Why would I make it up?

57:45.196 --> 57:46.361
(sighing)

57:46.363 --> 57:47.930
I don't know, I don't know.

57:47.932 --> 57:49.298
- Just take it easy, okay?

57:54.438 --> 57:56.004
Tell me again what happened.

57:56.006 --> 57:57.673
- I picked up my
girlfriend at the cafe,

57:57.675 --> 57:59.641
we went down to, we
walked around the town,

57:59.643 --> 58:00.576
we went to the lighthouse.

58:00.578 --> 58:01.844
We came back to the hotel.

58:01.846 --> 58:03.545
We talked about getting
dinner, go for a drive.

58:03.547 --> 58:05.147
She went and took a bath,
I opened up the drawer

58:05.149 --> 58:06.448
and there it was.

58:06.450 --> 58:07.816
The tape was just
sitting right there.

58:10.154 --> 58:11.053
- Hmm.

58:13.257 --> 58:15.324
Are you suggesting that
someone's playing tricks on you?

58:15.326 --> 58:17.526
- Personally,
maybe, I don't know.

58:17.528 --> 58:18.727
It's the same tape.

58:19.563 --> 58:20.929
- Really?

58:20.931 --> 58:22.297
How do you know
it's the same tape?

58:22.299 --> 58:23.198
Did you look at it
before coming here?

58:23.200 --> 58:24.233
- No I didn't.

58:26.270 --> 58:27.169
- Hmm.

58:29.540 --> 58:30.506
Tell me something.

58:31.842 --> 58:33.275
Does your girlfriend
know anything about this?

58:33.277 --> 58:35.277
- No, I'm the only one
who knows about this.

58:35.279 --> 58:36.545
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

58:39.750 --> 58:41.183
- Is your girlfriend
back at the inn?

58:41.185 --> 58:42.084
- [Billy] Yes.

58:50.060 --> 58:50.993
- Jack?
- Detective.

58:50.995 --> 58:52.427
- Hey, just hold on a second.

58:52.429 --> 58:54.263
Hey Jack, do me a favor.

58:54.265 --> 58:55.631
Could you go to the Doctor's Inn

58:55.633 --> 58:57.900
and pick up a Lisa,

58:57.902 --> 58:58.934
- Morris.

58:58.936 --> 59:00.135
- Lisa Morris.

59:00.137 --> 59:02.804
She's on the second
floor, room two.

59:02.806 --> 59:04.006
Yeah, that's right.

59:05.576 --> 59:07.843
Yes, right away, thanks.

59:15.586 --> 59:18.320
(sign creaking)

59:23.427 --> 59:25.060
Lisa?

59:25.062 --> 59:26.361
I'm Detective Mueller.

59:26.363 --> 59:28.263
- Nice to meet you.
- Thanks for coming.

59:28.265 --> 59:29.197
- Is Billy okay?

59:29.199 --> 59:30.132
- Yeah, he's all right.

59:30.134 --> 59:31.366
Can I get you some coffee?

59:31.368 --> 59:33.402
- No, I'm good, thank you.

59:33.404 --> 59:34.603
- Okay.

59:34.605 --> 59:37.039
Yeah, he's fine, he's
in the next room.

59:37.041 --> 59:38.173
- Okay.

59:38.175 --> 59:40.008
What's this about?

59:40.010 --> 59:41.810
- Well, your boyfriend
called me this morning

59:41.812 --> 59:45.013
and he told me he
found a videotape.

59:45.950 --> 59:48.016
You know anything about this?

59:48.018 --> 59:48.884
- No.

59:52.089 --> 59:53.055
- Okay, well,

59:54.158 --> 59:56.124
things he told me
on this videotape

59:56.126 --> 59:57.192
are pretty gruesome.

59:59.363 --> 1:00:02.197
Evidently, a couple gets killed.

1:00:02.199 --> 1:00:03.398
And it's like a home movie,

1:00:03.400 --> 1:00:04.566
two guys filming it.

1:00:05.970 --> 1:00:07.469
I mean he was very detailed
with what he told me

1:00:07.471 --> 1:00:09.204
and it sounded very believable.

1:00:11.976 --> 1:00:13.575
He's pretty shaken up.

1:00:14.912 --> 1:00:17.145
He brought the tape over
just as I was about to leave

1:00:17.147 --> 1:00:18.213
for the day, and,

1:00:19.483 --> 1:00:20.882
when we popped the tape in,

1:00:22.453 --> 1:00:23.885
there was nothing on there.

1:00:24.855 --> 1:00:27.489
It's completely blank.

1:00:27.491 --> 1:00:28.390
- That's crazy.

1:00:29.360 --> 1:00:30.258
- Yeah, I'll say.

1:00:32.262 --> 1:00:35.063
Anyhow, that's why I
asked you to come here.

1:00:37.935 --> 1:00:39.801
Lisa, how long have
you been dating?

1:00:42.740 --> 1:00:44.806
- Like a little
less than a year.

1:00:48.278 --> 1:00:49.444
- And how did you meet?

1:00:51.015 --> 1:00:52.280
- We had mutual
friends that worked

1:00:52.282 --> 1:00:54.950
at a bar together
in our neighborhood.

1:00:54.952 --> 1:00:56.485
- And then you started dating?

1:00:57.287 --> 1:00:59.021
- Yeah, pretty much.

1:00:59.023 --> 1:00:59.888
- Okay.

1:01:02.793 --> 1:01:05.160
Do you know anything
about his background?

1:01:05.162 --> 1:01:06.194
- Not much.

1:01:06.196 --> 1:01:07.229
I just know that
his parents died

1:01:07.231 --> 1:01:08.530
when he was really young.

1:01:09.333 --> 1:01:10.232
- Uh huh.

1:01:12.202 --> 1:01:14.803
- And he hadn't been back since.

1:01:15.706 --> 1:01:17.506
This meant a lot to him.

1:01:21.045 --> 1:01:22.511
It was rough.

1:01:23.681 --> 1:01:25.881
You know, we don't get
out of the city much.

1:01:27.451 --> 1:01:28.350
- I see.

1:01:29.987 --> 1:01:31.453
Do you know how
his parents died?

1:01:33.290 --> 1:01:34.890
- No, I don't.

1:01:34.892 --> 1:01:36.658
Again, he doesn't
really say much.

1:01:37.761 --> 1:01:39.561
I just know that it was,

1:01:39.563 --> 1:01:42.330
I just know that it was
really really painful for him.

1:01:43.667 --> 1:01:45.033
- Any idea who raised him?

1:01:45.969 --> 1:01:46.968
- I think his aunt.

1:01:48.372 --> 1:01:50.272
Again, he doesn't say much.

1:01:50.274 --> 1:01:51.840
Just bits and pieces, you know?

1:01:54.378 --> 1:01:55.243
- Hmm.

1:01:59.316 --> 1:02:00.348
Is he on medication?

1:02:03.153 --> 1:02:04.086
I have to ask.

1:02:05.622 --> 1:02:07.322
- Yes, he is.

1:02:09.126 --> 1:02:11.293
But I don't know the
name of it, though.

1:02:16.366 --> 1:02:18.700
- (sighing) Oh, man.

1:02:20.137 --> 1:02:21.503
This is a tough one, Lisa.

1:02:23.440 --> 1:02:25.974
I mean, (sighing)

1:02:25.976 --> 1:02:29.010
He's convinced he saw
people getting killed

1:02:29.012 --> 1:02:29.911
on this tape.

1:02:31.315 --> 1:02:33.181
And I mean, and I've
got the tape right here

1:02:33.183 --> 1:02:34.549
and it's completely blank.

1:02:35.753 --> 1:02:36.918
And I don't know what to do.

1:02:36.920 --> 1:02:39.621
I don't know if he
thinks he saw something

1:02:39.623 --> 1:02:43.291
or maybe somebody's
trying to play tricks

1:02:43.293 --> 1:02:44.092
on him or something.

1:02:47.364 --> 1:02:50.098
(sighing)

1:02:50.100 --> 1:02:52.701
Listen, I'm gonna
release him to you.

1:02:54.037 --> 1:02:57.005
But at this point, there's
nothing more I can do.

1:02:57.007 --> 1:02:58.140
- He's a good guy.

1:02:58.142 --> 1:02:59.574
- I know he's a good guy.

1:02:59.576 --> 1:03:01.843
But there's nothing
more I can do here.

1:03:05.616 --> 1:03:08.416
I would suggest just
maybe having him

1:03:08.418 --> 1:03:09.718
see a therapist.

1:03:13.690 --> 1:03:16.258
(light music)

1:03:19.863 --> 1:03:21.997
- Can I get you guys
any dessert tonight?

1:03:23.066 --> 1:03:25.500
- I think we're good, thank you.

1:03:25.502 --> 1:03:27.135
- [Waitress] Get
this out of your way.

1:03:27.137 --> 1:03:28.703
- Yeah.

1:03:28.705 --> 1:03:29.771
- Thank you.

1:03:49.226 --> 1:03:52.460
- I'm sorry you went
through all that.

1:03:53.897 --> 1:03:55.897
- I'm sorry I put
you through all that.

1:04:05.342 --> 1:04:08.276
- I just want you
to open up to me.

1:04:12.616 --> 1:04:14.516
You scared the shit out of me.

1:04:42.446 --> 1:04:45.680
- I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

1:04:45.682 --> 1:04:48.783
I'm gonna get us another
bottle of wine to go.

1:04:52.055 --> 1:04:54.122
- I'm gonna call my mom.

1:04:56.226 --> 1:04:57.559
- [Billy] Okay.

1:05:13.043 --> 1:05:14.743
- I just wanted to say hi
and see how you're doing.

1:05:14.745 --> 1:05:16.177
You're good?

1:05:16.179 --> 1:05:17.112
Okay, good.

1:05:20.317 --> 1:05:22.150
I'll call you tomorrow, okay?

1:05:22.152 --> 1:05:22.984
Okay cool.

1:05:22.986 --> 1:05:23.885
Love you.

1:05:30.861 --> 1:05:33.428
Oh you scared the
shit out of me.

1:05:33.430 --> 1:05:34.896
- [Billy] How's your mom?

1:05:34.898 --> 1:05:38.366
- She's good.

1:05:38.368 --> 1:05:39.467
She said she says hi.

1:05:40.904 --> 1:05:41.903
- Some wine.

1:05:41.905 --> 1:05:42.804
- Good.

1:05:45.375 --> 1:05:46.474
Hey baby, I gotta pee.

1:05:46.476 --> 1:05:47.909
- Okay, go, go ahead, pee.

1:05:47.911 --> 1:05:49.544
- Be right back, okay?

1:05:49.546 --> 1:05:51.212
- I'll be in the car.

1:05:51.214 --> 1:05:52.380
- Okay, cool.

1:06:29.786 --> 1:06:30.685
Shit.

1:06:32.389 --> 1:06:34.990
I think I left my phone
at the restaurant.

1:06:34.992 --> 1:06:36.191
- What?

1:06:36.193 --> 1:06:40.895
- I think I left my
phone at the restaurant.

1:06:47.604 --> 1:06:49.037
- Did you find a cellphone?

1:06:49.039 --> 1:06:50.638
- [Woman] I don't
know, just have a look.

1:06:50.640 --> 1:06:51.840
Is this yours?

1:06:51.842 --> 1:06:52.807
- Oh thank you.

1:06:52.809 --> 1:06:54.943
- [Woman] You're welcome.

1:06:58.615 --> 1:06:59.814
- Charles, right?

1:06:59.816 --> 1:07:00.982
- Hey there, yeah.

1:07:02.919 --> 1:07:04.119
- Billy, it was
at the lighthouse.

1:07:04.121 --> 1:07:05.286
- You and your
girlfriend, right?

1:07:05.288 --> 1:07:06.321
- Yeah.

1:07:06.323 --> 1:07:07.489
- Where's your gal?

1:07:07.491 --> 1:07:09.124
- She's back at the inn.

1:07:09.126 --> 1:07:10.959
- Well you enjoying
your stay here?

1:07:12.496 --> 1:07:16.965
- It's been a bad day today.

1:07:16.967 --> 1:07:19.067
- Oh we all have bad days.

1:07:19.069 --> 1:07:20.301
- Yeah?

1:07:20.303 --> 1:07:22.604
- Look, why don't you
join me for a drink?

1:07:22.606 --> 1:07:24.105
Come on.

1:07:24.107 --> 1:07:26.975
Sweetheart, a fresh one
and one for my friend.

1:07:26.977 --> 1:07:28.109
- [Bartender] You bet.

1:07:33.350 --> 1:07:36.951
- So, tell me all
about your bad day.

1:07:38.255 --> 1:07:40.488
Seemed like you two were
having fun at the lighthouse.

1:07:40.490 --> 1:07:42.891
- Yeah that was the
highlight of my whole stay.

1:07:44.394 --> 1:07:45.293
Great.

1:07:46.363 --> 1:07:47.262
Thank you.

1:07:48.598 --> 1:07:51.900
It's been, well,

1:07:53.203 --> 1:07:55.703
a lot of weird things going on.

1:07:57.274 --> 1:07:59.107
- [Charles] Huh,
what kind of weird?

1:08:00.477 --> 1:08:03.578
- Well, I just don't want
you to think I'm crazy,

1:08:03.580 --> 1:08:06.614
but when I was putting
clothes in my drawer,

1:08:06.616 --> 1:08:08.716
the drawer shut itself.

1:08:09.619 --> 1:08:10.585
I didn't touch it.

1:08:12.255 --> 1:08:14.355
And then this goofy thing
happened with my watch,

1:08:14.357 --> 1:08:16.057
and I lost an hour of time.

1:08:17.127 --> 1:08:19.627
Like, I don't know
where it went.

1:08:19.629 --> 1:08:24.699
And then a painting just
falling on the floor.

1:08:26.103 --> 1:08:27.402
- I guess I shouldn't
have told you

1:08:27.404 --> 1:08:29.003
that that place was haunted.

1:08:29.005 --> 1:08:30.738
- No, it's okay.

1:08:30.740 --> 1:08:32.807
I'm just learning
the hard way, thanks.

1:08:34.811 --> 1:08:36.878
- The painting
you're talking about,

1:08:36.880 --> 1:08:38.213
is it of the shipwreck?

1:08:40.317 --> 1:08:44.185
- It's a ship being tossed
around by the sea, yeah.

1:08:45.288 --> 1:08:47.122
- The ship in that painting,

1:08:47.124 --> 1:08:49.124
it's the Sir Edmund James.

1:08:49.126 --> 1:08:51.493
Remember the shipwreck I
told you about on the tour?

1:08:51.495 --> 1:08:52.961
- Ah yeah, of course, right.

1:08:54.297 --> 1:08:56.297
- Legend has it that
old Captain Louis

1:08:56.299 --> 1:08:58.266
still roams those
halls at night.

1:08:59.803 --> 1:09:02.370
It's all in that ghost
tour that I told you about.

1:09:04.407 --> 1:09:07.308
(laughing) I could
tell you scare easily.

1:09:07.310 --> 1:09:08.510
- God, well, yeah,

1:09:08.512 --> 1:09:11.146
well it's like you say,
it's just folklore.

1:09:11.148 --> 1:09:13.081
- And if you wish to
believe that sort of thing

1:09:13.083 --> 1:09:14.449
you compound the problem.

1:09:17.187 --> 1:09:18.219
- What do you mean?

1:09:20.157 --> 1:09:21.055
- Well.

1:09:22.125 --> 1:09:23.424
I'm not the sort of
person that really buys

1:09:23.426 --> 1:09:26.361
into all of the
hocus pocus stuff.

1:09:26.363 --> 1:09:27.695
But I got people who swear to me

1:09:27.697 --> 1:09:30.265
they see things in this town.

1:09:30.267 --> 1:09:31.666
- Like what?

1:09:31.668 --> 1:09:36.504
- You know, supernatural,
ghosts, sightings.

1:09:36.506 --> 1:09:38.273
Things not of this world.

1:09:40.510 --> 1:09:42.911
- Has anything ever happened

1:09:42.913 --> 1:09:44.679
in the hotel where
I'm staying at?

1:09:46.082 --> 1:09:48.349
- (chuckling) I'm sure a
lot of things have happened.

1:09:48.351 --> 1:09:51.486
It's over 150 years old,
there's a lot of history.

1:09:51.488 --> 1:09:52.387
- No, I mean,

1:09:54.457 --> 1:09:56.124
is there anything in particular?

1:09:57.694 --> 1:09:59.427
- Where are you going
with this, Billy?

1:10:04.801 --> 1:10:07.335
- I found this
videocassette under my bed

1:10:07.337 --> 1:10:08.703
and I put it in the player.

1:10:08.705 --> 1:10:10.371
And this home video comes up

1:10:11.474 --> 1:10:14.943
and it's this couple,
them driving around

1:10:14.945 --> 1:10:17.245
and then being followed
by these two guys

1:10:17.247 --> 1:10:19.147
with a video camera.

1:10:19.149 --> 1:10:22.584
And they get into some
sort of altercation.

1:10:22.586 --> 1:10:26.287
And then the video
kind of fuzzes out

1:10:26.289 --> 1:10:29.157
and a picture comes back up.

1:10:30.293 --> 1:10:33.728
And these two guys
were right in front of

1:10:33.730 --> 1:10:35.730
my hotel door.

1:10:35.732 --> 1:10:36.664
- Are you shitting me?

1:10:36.666 --> 1:10:38.733
- No, right where I'm staying.

1:10:39.803 --> 1:10:43.638
They break in and they
murder that couple.

1:10:43.640 --> 1:10:45.473
They butcher them.

1:10:50.313 --> 1:10:52.947
- That's one hell
of a story there.

1:10:56.720 --> 1:10:58.019
- Well does it sound familiar?

1:11:04.828 --> 1:11:06.094
Tell me.

1:11:06.096 --> 1:11:09.063
- Well, there have
been a few murders

1:11:09.065 --> 1:11:10.698
over the years here.

1:11:11.668 --> 1:11:13.134
- [Billy] How many is a few?

1:11:14.537 --> 1:11:15.436
- I don't know.

1:11:16.806 --> 1:11:20.942
I'd say, there's been about

1:11:20.944 --> 1:11:23.978
eight unsolved murders
in the last 40 years.

1:11:25.081 --> 1:11:27.815
The one you mentioned,
I remember it all right.

1:11:29.119 --> 1:11:32.520
It was damn grisly, those
kids they butchered.

1:11:33.490 --> 1:11:35.056
They were just a young couple.

1:11:38.461 --> 1:11:40.628
No one ever mentions it.

1:11:40.630 --> 1:11:41.796
None of it.

1:11:41.798 --> 1:11:43.197
- Well what about the cops?

1:11:44.901 --> 1:11:46.200
- Cops?

1:11:46.202 --> 1:11:47.902
They're useless.

1:11:47.904 --> 1:11:49.904
This is a one horse town.

1:11:49.906 --> 1:11:51.706
- So they didn't do
anything about it?

1:11:51.708 --> 1:11:53.007
They don't care?

1:11:53.009 --> 1:11:54.208
- Sure, they care
about keeping things

1:11:54.210 --> 1:11:56.411
like that out of the paper.

1:11:56.413 --> 1:11:58.212
Hurts the economy.

1:11:58.214 --> 1:12:00.415
Tourism is this town's
bread and butter.

1:12:05.088 --> 1:12:06.187
- When did it happen?

1:12:07.590 --> 1:12:08.489
The last one?

1:12:10.160 --> 1:12:12.827
How long ago?

1:12:12.829 --> 1:12:13.728
- Oh.

1:12:14.931 --> 1:12:17.465
I don't know, I'm
bad with dates.

1:12:17.467 --> 1:12:19.233
Plus I've been
drinking all night.

1:12:19.235 --> 1:12:20.868
- Are you sure?

1:12:20.870 --> 1:12:22.136
- Of course I'm sure.

1:12:25.842 --> 1:12:28.409
(tense music)

1:12:31.881 --> 1:12:33.414
- [Billy] What?

1:12:33.416 --> 1:12:34.315
Charles, what?

1:12:39.489 --> 1:12:41.489
- Be careful out there, Billy.

1:12:47.797 --> 1:12:50.365
(light music)

1:13:48.725 --> 1:13:51.292
(tense music)

1:13:52.328 --> 1:13:54.562
(revving)

1:13:56.666 --> 1:13:58.733
- This guy following me?

1:13:59.736 --> 1:14:01.969
(revving)

1:14:25.728 --> 1:14:30.798
(revving)
(tires screeching)

1:14:37.340 --> 1:14:38.840
What do you want?

1:14:40.109 --> 1:14:42.043
(banging)

1:14:42.045 --> 1:14:43.511
What do you want?

1:14:57.060 --> 1:14:59.293
(revving)

1:15:52.882 --> 1:15:55.216
(mumbling)

1:16:04.460 --> 1:16:06.794
(creaking)

1:16:11.734 --> 1:16:13.968
(dinging)

1:16:16.172 --> 1:16:18.372
- Hello, can I assist you?

1:16:19.208 --> 1:16:20.141
- Where's the phone?

1:16:20.143 --> 1:16:21.976
- It's behind the desk.

1:16:21.978 --> 1:16:23.044
- I need you to make a call.

1:16:23.046 --> 1:16:23.945
- Okay.

1:16:23.947 --> 1:16:24.979
Who shall I phone?

1:16:27.483 --> 1:16:29.750
- There was an
incident that happened.

1:16:29.752 --> 1:16:31.752
I need you to call the police.

1:16:31.754 --> 1:16:33.120
- What sort of an incident?

1:16:33.122 --> 1:16:35.456
- There was a car
that was following me.

1:16:35.458 --> 1:16:36.958
- That's it?

1:16:36.960 --> 1:16:38.459
Maybe they were lost.

1:16:38.461 --> 1:16:40.561
- Are all you people in on this?

1:16:40.563 --> 1:16:42.330
- What do you mean you people?

1:16:42.332 --> 1:16:45.366
Look, I'll be happy to
make the phone call,

1:16:45.368 --> 1:16:47.702
but you gotta realize one thing.

1:16:47.704 --> 1:16:51.973
It's past midnight and
there's only one car

1:16:51.975 --> 1:16:54.809
to patrol the whole island.

1:16:54.811 --> 1:16:56.510
- I don't care if
there's only one car

1:16:56.512 --> 1:16:58.813
that needs to go
patrol the goddamn zoo!

1:16:58.815 --> 1:17:01.215
I don't care, call
the fucking police!

1:17:01.217 --> 1:17:03.217
I need you to call the police!

1:17:03.219 --> 1:17:05.753
Get the phone, make
the phone call!

1:17:05.755 --> 1:17:06.821
Call!
- All right, all right!

1:17:06.823 --> 1:17:07.922
I'd be happy to do it.

1:17:07.924 --> 1:17:09.390
- Thank you!

1:17:09.392 --> 1:17:11.759
- You know, it may
take a while for them

1:17:11.761 --> 1:17:13.260
to arrive, that's all.

1:17:13.262 --> 1:17:15.963
If you want me to call
them, I'll call them.

1:17:15.965 --> 1:17:17.198
- No, no, no.

1:17:17.200 --> 1:17:18.833
No, I don't want
you to call them.

1:17:18.835 --> 1:17:20.768
I don't want you to call them.

1:17:20.770 --> 1:17:21.669
Forget it.

1:17:22.739 --> 1:17:24.672
Just forget it.

1:17:24.674 --> 1:17:26.874
- Sir, I'll be
happy to call them.

1:17:26.876 --> 1:17:28.643
It might take a while.

1:17:29.646 --> 1:17:30.544
Sir?

1:17:31.347 --> 1:17:32.246
Sir?

1:17:40.690 --> 1:17:41.756
(knocking)

1:17:41.758 --> 1:17:43.024
- [Billy] Baby, it's me.

1:17:46.262 --> 1:17:47.862
Let me in.

1:17:47.864 --> 1:17:48.763
- Coming.

1:17:51.167 --> 1:17:52.400
Hey.

1:17:52.402 --> 1:17:54.702
(creaking)

1:18:05.381 --> 1:18:06.547
- Your battery's dead.

1:18:10.286 --> 1:18:11.752
- [Lisa] Is everything okay?

1:18:14.590 --> 1:18:16.323
Billy, is everything okay?

1:18:25.501 --> 1:18:27.702
- Black car ran me off the road.

1:18:27.704 --> 1:18:31.172
It was the same car that
was at the rest stop.

1:18:31.174 --> 1:18:33.007
These are the same people

1:18:33.009 --> 1:18:34.275
that did this

1:18:34.277 --> 1:18:35.209
in the videotape.
- Okay just relax.

1:18:35.211 --> 1:18:36.711
- These are the same people

1:18:36.713 --> 1:18:39.080
and they wanna kill us,
that's what they wanna do.

1:18:55.798 --> 1:18:57.164
I went to go pick up your phone

1:18:57.166 --> 1:18:59.233
and you know that guy
at the lighthouse?

1:19:01.804 --> 1:19:02.636
- Charles.

1:19:02.638 --> 1:19:03.938
- Charles, Charles.

1:19:03.940 --> 1:19:06.207
Charles was at the restaurant.

1:19:06.209 --> 1:19:08.642
He told me that there
were murders in this town.

1:19:08.644 --> 1:19:09.744
- You're freaking me out.

1:19:09.746 --> 1:19:11.378
- Huh?

1:19:11.380 --> 1:19:12.279
They're gonna come
and murder us,

1:19:12.281 --> 1:19:13.080
'cause it's what they do.

1:19:14.117 --> 1:19:15.616
They pinpoint the
couple that comes around

1:19:15.618 --> 1:19:16.984
this time of the year
on the off season

1:19:16.986 --> 1:19:17.985
and they kill 'em.

1:19:21.924 --> 1:19:22.823
- Billy.

1:19:24.927 --> 1:19:27.261
The detective said there
was nothing on the tape.

1:19:27.263 --> 1:19:29.230
- Well, of course there's
nothing on the tape

1:19:29.232 --> 1:19:30.064
'cause that's what they do,

1:19:30.066 --> 1:19:31.298
they erase the tape.

1:19:31.300 --> 1:19:32.233
Go charge your phone.

1:19:32.235 --> 1:19:33.734
- I feel sick, I wanna go.

1:19:33.736 --> 1:19:35.369
We're going, that's
what we're doing.

1:19:35.371 --> 1:19:39.173
- We can't leave because
the tire's blown.

1:19:39.175 --> 1:19:40.274
- What?!
- The tire's blown.

1:19:40.276 --> 1:19:41.742
- What do you mean the tire?

1:19:43.045 --> 1:19:45.379
- I pulled into the
parking lot, tire's blown.

1:19:46.516 --> 1:19:47.715
- Then what about
the guy downstairs?

1:19:47.717 --> 1:19:49.483
- He's in on it too.

1:19:49.485 --> 1:19:50.584
- Well then we're
gonna call triple A,

1:19:50.586 --> 1:19:51.519
that's what we're gonna do.

1:19:51.521 --> 1:19:52.920
- Nah, we can't call triple A.

1:19:52.922 --> 1:19:54.722
Triple A can't come,
they're not gonna come now.

1:19:54.724 --> 1:19:56.290
We gotta wait till the morning.

1:19:56.292 --> 1:19:57.124
We gotta stay here.

1:19:57.126 --> 1:19:59.260
So make yourself comfy.

1:19:59.262 --> 1:20:01.162
Charge your phone,
just lie down.

1:20:02.565 --> 1:20:04.031
Just relax tonight.

1:20:22.051 --> 1:20:24.618
(tense music)

1:20:50.780 --> 1:20:53.547
(waves crashing)

1:20:58.588 --> 1:21:01.121
(tense music)

1:21:21.711 --> 1:21:24.044
(thunking)

1:21:31.053 --> 1:21:33.354
(creaking)

1:21:38.060 --> 1:21:38.959
(Lisa screaming)

1:21:38.961 --> 1:21:41.295
- [Lisa] Help, Billy, help me!

1:21:41.297 --> 1:21:43.764
- Isn't she hot, look at her!

1:21:46.202 --> 1:21:48.769
(tense music)

1:21:49.605 --> 1:21:52.239
(man laughing)

1:21:56.312 --> 1:21:59.079
Why do you fucking
bleed so much?

1:22:03.119 --> 1:22:03.984
Oh, hello.

1:22:04.921 --> 1:22:06.320
You're just in time.

1:22:06.322 --> 1:22:07.154
Come here.

1:22:07.156 --> 1:22:08.589
Wake up, asshole.

1:22:09.892 --> 1:22:12.960
(breathing heavily)

1:22:40.823 --> 1:22:41.889
- Ah, Billy.

1:22:43.059 --> 1:22:44.358
How was your stay?

1:22:44.360 --> 1:22:46.627
- I'd rather not talk about it.

1:22:46.629 --> 1:22:47.761
- Mr. Curtis.

1:22:48.798 --> 1:22:50.731
I need you to sign this please.

1:22:54.470 --> 1:22:57.471
Victor tells me that there
was a car chasing you

1:22:57.473 --> 1:23:00.074
and then you asked him
to call the police.

1:23:00.076 --> 1:23:01.976
- Yeah, it was real fun.

1:23:01.978 --> 1:23:04.244
- Well maybe it's just a
couple kids messing around,

1:23:04.246 --> 1:23:05.779
you know, with
nothing better to do.

1:23:05.781 --> 1:23:06.647
- Yeah, maybe.

1:23:07.850 --> 1:23:09.650
- Let me give you a
better pen, I'm sorry.

1:23:10.953 --> 1:23:12.186
Here, try this one.

1:23:16.092 --> 1:23:17.524
We hope to see you again

1:23:17.526 --> 1:23:20.361
and I'm sorry your stay
wasn't everything you planned.

1:23:20.363 --> 1:23:21.528
- Yeah, things happen.

1:23:42.218 --> 1:23:43.617
- (laughing) Of course, no.

1:23:43.619 --> 1:23:45.652
We look forward to
seeing you as well.

1:23:45.654 --> 1:23:46.854
See you then, bye.

1:23:48.090 --> 1:23:49.556
What's this?

1:23:49.558 --> 1:23:51.859
- The couple in room two,
they left this behind.

1:23:55.664 --> 1:23:57.197
Yeah, I guess they dropped it.

1:23:57.199 --> 1:23:58.165
Maybe you can give them a call.

1:23:58.167 --> 1:23:59.600
They'd surely want it back.

1:24:00.936 --> 1:24:02.903
- I don't think they'll need it.

1:24:02.905 --> 1:24:04.304
They won't be coming back.

1:24:09.011 --> 1:24:13.447
No.

1:24:13.449 --> 1:24:15.682
(revving)

1:24:18.354 --> 1:24:20.921
(tense music)

1:24:48.117 --> 1:24:49.283
- Baby, baby.

1:24:50.119 --> 1:24:51.819
Call the police.

1:24:51.821 --> 1:24:52.719
- Huh?

1:24:53.923 --> 1:24:54.721
You're okay.

1:24:54.723 --> 1:24:55.622
- No.

1:24:57.159 --> 1:24:59.460
(clacking)

1:25:03.265 --> 1:25:04.998
- Just pull over
babe, pull over.

1:25:05.000 --> 1:25:05.933
- Come on.

1:25:05.935 --> 1:25:07.401
- Just pull over, you're okay.

1:25:07.403 --> 1:25:09.103
You're just gonna pull
over right now, pull over.

1:25:11.440 --> 1:25:12.272
Just pull over.

1:25:12.274 --> 1:25:13.207
You got this.

1:25:13.209 --> 1:25:14.608
- There's the car, he's back.

1:25:14.610 --> 1:25:15.909
He's right behind us.

1:25:53.616 --> 1:25:56.049
(sighing)

1:25:56.051 --> 1:25:57.117
- Oh my god.

1:25:59.889 --> 1:26:01.021
- Billy, pull over.

1:26:01.023 --> 1:26:02.256
Billy, pull over.

1:26:02.258 --> 1:26:03.157
Billy?

1:26:04.660 --> 1:26:06.927
No, no, no,
seriously, pull over.

1:26:06.929 --> 1:26:07.861
Billy, you're okay.

1:26:07.863 --> 1:26:08.795
- No, no!

1:26:11.167 --> 1:26:12.099
- Pull over, babe.

1:26:12.101 --> 1:26:13.433
Please, please, slow down.

1:26:15.704 --> 1:26:16.537
Billy, slow down.

1:26:16.539 --> 1:26:17.504
Please pull over.

1:26:17.506 --> 1:26:18.405
Please pull over.

1:26:20.142 --> 1:26:21.208
Please over.

1:26:22.678 --> 1:26:24.144
Please pull over.

1:26:25.748 --> 1:26:26.647
- Oh shit.

1:26:28.184 --> 1:26:30.751
(tense music)

1:27:01.784 --> 1:27:04.117
(shutting)

1:27:08.290 --> 1:27:11.291
(breathing heavily)

1:27:17.299 --> 1:27:18.365
- Stay here.

1:27:33.249 --> 1:27:35.048
Come on, you're okay.

1:27:39.488 --> 1:27:41.054
You're okay, okay?

1:28:09.985 --> 1:28:12.219
(sobbing)

1:28:21.897 --> 1:28:23.463
- He's everywhere.

1:28:39.214 --> 1:28:41.448
(sobbing)

1:28:46.955 --> 1:28:52.025
I can't shake him. (sobbing)

1:28:56.098 --> 1:29:01.168
I can't shake him. (sighing)

1:29:18.954 --> 1:29:19.953
I love you.

1:29:22.024 --> 1:29:23.156
- I love you.

1:29:30.099 --> 1:29:31.231
- I love you.

1:29:45.681 --> 1:29:46.580
- Okay.

1:29:48.117 --> 1:29:51.585
We're gonna get the
fuck out of this place.

1:29:52.988 --> 1:29:56.123
(somber piano music)
