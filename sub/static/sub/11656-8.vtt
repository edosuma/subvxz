00:04.672 --> 00:09.385
I, Aku, the shape-shifting
master of darkness,

00:09.469 --> 00:13.056
unleashed an unspeakable evil.

The drones would swarm the ship
before I could get inside.

18:36.867 --> 18:38.535
Now, go! Go!

18:40.662 --> 18:41.830
VERBINA: <i>Jack!</i>

18:42.331 --> 18:43.332
Jack?

18:43.624 --> 18:45.250
Can we help him somehow?

18:45.375 --> 18:47.502
With the ship's
artificial gravity back on,

18:47.586 --> 18:50.547
I feel strong enough
to take those drones myself.

18:50.756 --> 18:52.007
Maybe we can.

18:52.215 --> 18:55.385
If we recalibrate the gravity generator
to full negative

18:55.469 --> 18:57.679
and reroute it
through the transmission dish...

18:57.763 --> 18:59.348
ASTOR: We could extend
the ship's force field

18:59.431 --> 19:01.975
out far enough to encapsulate
the drone horde...

19:02.059 --> 19:04.645
VERBINA: Negating the gravity
within the entire bubble!

19:37.260 --> 19:39.096
(INTENSE MUSIC PLAYING)

20:17.050 --> 20:18.969
Jack, we did it.

20:19.302 --> 20:21.680
Look. We really did it.

20:23.557 --> 20:25.726
Oh, thank you, Jack. Thank you.

20:26.059 --> 20:27.436
Yes. Thank you, Jack.

20:27.769 --> 20:29.521
You risked your life to help us,

20:29.771 --> 20:31.398
yet we are strangers.

20:31.732 --> 20:34.025
How can we possibly show our gratitude?

20:35.110 --> 20:36.278
Save your home.

20:36.403 --> 20:37.404
- What?
- What?

20:37.487 --> 20:39.156
We are not such strangers, I think.

20:39.489 --> 20:40.866
Our stories are much alike,

20:41.324 --> 20:43.452
for I, too, was a prince

20:43.785 --> 20:45.954
given charge to save my land,

20:46.580 --> 20:47.789
but, I...

20:49.040 --> 20:51.668
I could not let your story
end like mine...

20:52.252 --> 20:53.462
with Aku.

20:57.591 --> 20:59.676
Your story's not over yet.

21:00.969 --> 21:03.847
Go to your people.
There is no time to lose.

21:04.181 --> 21:05.724
BOTH: Yes, Your Majesty.

21:05.849 --> 21:07.267
Wing well, Jack.

21:07.350 --> 21:08.977
We won't forget you!
