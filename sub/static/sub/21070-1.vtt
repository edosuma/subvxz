03:48.228 --> 03:51.315
- Hi.

03:51.315 --> 03:52.941
- A colonial?

03:52.941 --> 03:54.568
- Yeah, I alwaysliked colonials.

03:54.568 --> 03:56.487
- I know. I just didn't thinkyou were serious.

03:56.487 --> 03:58.364
- It's the perfectcombination--

03:58.364 --> 04:00.324
old-world charm,modern convenience.

04:00.324 --> 04:02.452
- Where are we--18th-century New England?

04:02.452 --> 04:04.578
No, I don't want to livein some fairy-tale replica

04:04.578 --> 04:06.664
of a bygone era--it's ridiculous.

04:06.664 --> 04:08.458
- It doesn't matterwhat the style is, anyway.

04:08.458 --> 04:10.000
The important thingis a practical floor plan

04:10.000 --> 04:11.502
and a good location--

04:11.502 --> 04:13.420
how far is the commute,how good are the schools.

04:13.420 --> 04:14.797
- Schools are important.

04:14.797 --> 04:17.466
- Yeah, they increaseproperty values.

04:18.884 --> 04:21.428
- What a transformation.

04:21.428 --> 04:23.138
- I can't tell the oldfrom the new.

04:23.138 --> 04:24.431
- There isn't any old left.

04:24.431 --> 04:27.101
We just kept the facade.Everything else is new.

04:27.101 --> 04:29.269
- Wow. That'sa million-dollar view.

04:29.269 --> 04:30.896
- It's closer to 1.3 million.

04:30.896 --> 04:33.524
- Now there's a water viewin every room.

04:33.524 --> 04:35.734
Remember how awful the place waswhen we bought it,

04:35.734 --> 04:37.695
with that chartreuse shag rug

04:37.695 --> 04:39.780
and the sprayed-oncottage cheese ceiling?

04:39.780 --> 04:41.782
- We thought the ceilingswere only 8 feet.

04:41.782 --> 04:44.368
But believe it or not,they were 11 feet.

04:44.368 --> 04:45.744
- We only found outwhen we poked through

04:45.744 --> 04:47.497
to put in those skylights.

04:47.497 --> 04:48.997
- You remember how it waslaid out like a train,

04:48.997 --> 04:50.500
just all long and narrow?- Mm-hmm.

04:50.500 --> 04:52.167
- We completely openedall of this up.

04:52.167 --> 04:54.002
We ran a huge steel beam

04:54.002 --> 04:56.547
the entire lengthof the house for support.

04:56.547 --> 04:58.882
It cost us 20 grand.- It was so worth it.

04:58.882 --> 05:00.968
Our architect had a lotof creative ideas.

05:00.968 --> 05:03.178
- It's a brand-new house.- It's completely different.

05:03.178 --> 05:04.555
I-I don't evenrecognize the place.

05:04.555 --> 05:06.348
- That's becausewhen we opened it all up.

05:06.348 --> 05:08.393
We had to relocatethe staircase.

05:08.393 --> 05:10.477
- Which completely changedthe layout upstairs.

05:10.477 --> 05:12.187
- Wow.- Ouch!

05:12.187 --> 05:14.565
- Yeah, would have beencheaper to build new.

05:14.565 --> 05:16.150
- You're kidding.

05:16.150 --> 05:17.776
- Well, there are a lotof hidden conditions.

05:17.776 --> 05:19.404
I mean, you don't knowuntil you open up the walls.

05:19.404 --> 05:20.738
- It was not cheaperto build new.

05:20.738 --> 05:23.408
Ivan did a lotof the work himself.

05:23.408 --> 05:25.200
- You did?

05:25.200 --> 05:26.952
- No.- You programmed the audio

05:26.952 --> 05:28.871
and lighting systemsthroughout the whole house.

05:28.871 --> 05:30.415
- That can be tricky.- Yeah.

05:30.415 --> 05:31.790
No, I hope you worea hard hat for that.

05:33.542 --> 05:34.960
- Remember the kitchen?

05:34.960 --> 05:37.004
It was totallyoriginal condition,

05:37.004 --> 05:39.047
hadn't been updated at all--

05:39.047 --> 05:41.925
Formica counters,electric stove,

05:41.925 --> 05:45.262
avocado-green fridge, linoleum.- It was sweet.

05:45.262 --> 05:48.015
- Sweet, yeah, but not reallysuited to our lifestyle.

05:48.015 --> 05:49.600
- We gutted it completely.- Mm-hmm.

05:49.600 --> 05:51.351
- Oh, I've gottenso many compliments

05:51.351 --> 05:53.020
on your plates, Drew.

05:53.020 --> 05:56.440
- Oh, that's so nice.- Drew, you made those?

05:56.440 --> 05:57.858
Oh, my God,those are beautiful!

05:57.858 --> 05:59.651
I had no ideahow creative you were.

05:59.651 --> 06:01.361
- She has a great eye for color,doesn't she?

06:01.361 --> 06:03.363
- Right? I keep telling herwe can grow a business.

06:03.363 --> 06:04.656
With the right marketing,

06:04.656 --> 06:06.533
you could be movingthousands of units.

06:06.533 --> 06:08.410
- Moving units.That's so funny.

06:08.410 --> 06:11.539
- Would you make a set for us?Seriously, we'd commission you.

06:11.539 --> 06:13.583
- Ah, you signed it.I was gonna ask you to sign it.

06:13.583 --> 06:15.334
I have no doubtthese are gonna be worth

06:15.334 --> 06:17.587
some money down the line.

06:17.587 --> 06:19.171
Drew Davis?

06:19.171 --> 06:21.424
- I use my maiden namefor artistic pursuits.

06:21.424 --> 06:22.841
- Huh.

06:22.841 --> 06:24.551
- So I heardyou guys found a house.

06:24.551 --> 06:26.345
- Ah, we made an offer.

06:26.345 --> 06:28.013
There's beensome back-and-forth.

06:28.013 --> 06:29.557
It's practically a tear-down.

06:29.557 --> 06:31.433
- Aw, that we're goingto lovingly restore.

06:31.433 --> 06:33.143
It's our dream house.

06:33.143 --> 06:34.479
- Don't say "dream house."

06:34.479 --> 06:36.271
If we invest ourselvesemotionally,

06:36.271 --> 06:38.857
it will be harder to walk away.- I don't want to walk away.

06:38.857 --> 06:40.610
- Well, you don't want themto know that.

06:40.610 --> 06:42.236
It gives them the upper hand.

06:42.236 --> 06:44.071
- If you find something good,you have to move fast.

06:44.071 --> 06:46.114
- We have to balance the needfor a quick decision

06:46.114 --> 06:48.116
with the needfor the right decision.

06:48.116 --> 06:50.619
- Sometimes you haveto take a chance.

06:50.619 --> 06:52.704
Go on a gut instinct.

06:52.704 --> 06:57.251
- Drew, we need to settle down,overcome our emotions,

06:57.251 --> 07:00.128
and make a sensiblehome-purchase decision.

07:00.128 --> 07:02.005
You know, a houseis like a marriage, right?

07:02.005 --> 07:03.757
You can't just jump in.

07:03.757 --> 07:05.509
And you can't just jump outif you want to unload it.

07:05.509 --> 07:09.346
You're stuck with that decisionfor a very long time...

07:09.346 --> 07:10.639
hopefully.

07:13.643 --> 07:15.894
- It is like a marriage.

07:15.894 --> 07:17.813
You do go by intuition.

07:17.813 --> 07:19.773
It's not somethingyou can analyze.

07:19.773 --> 07:21.275
- Intuition is a feeling.

07:21.275 --> 07:23.986
You don't basebig decisions on feelings.

07:23.986 --> 07:25.613
- You said it waslike a marriage.

07:25.613 --> 07:27.990
- Yeah, marriage isthe biggest decision of all.

07:27.990 --> 07:30.660
You don't base thaton just mere feelings.

07:38.458 --> 07:40.335
- Have you seenour warming drawer?

07:40.335 --> 07:42.588
- Ooh.- Mm-mm.

07:44.882 --> 07:46.466
- I like the way

07:46.466 --> 07:47.593
they did that recessedrectangle in the ceiling

07:47.593 --> 07:48.886
and the way it was lit up.

07:48.886 --> 07:50.513
- Oh, that just killed me.

07:50.513 --> 07:52.472
Here they havea classic mid-century modern,

07:52.472 --> 07:54.474
and they removeall the original fixtures

07:54.474 --> 07:57.060
and replace themwith recessed cans.

07:57.060 --> 07:59.104
- I like recessed cans.They work.

07:59.104 --> 08:00.522
They're bright.You can see.

08:00.522 --> 08:04.192
- You can see too much.

08:18.666 --> 08:21.877
- I'm ovulating.

08:21.877 --> 08:25.172
- What?- I'm ovulating.

08:26.757 --> 08:28.676
- Right now?How can you possibly tell?

08:28.676 --> 08:31.929
- Well, you just can.I know my body.

08:31.929 --> 08:34.724
I don't want to go into details,but, you know...

08:36.140 --> 08:38.936
Discharge.

08:38.936 --> 08:40.938
- Oh.

09:02.918 --> 09:06.171
I paddled 11 miles today.

09:06.171 --> 09:08.173
I'm totally exhausted.

09:08.173 --> 09:10.634
- Why do you always haveto go so far?

09:10.634 --> 09:11.927
- That's not that far.

09:11.927 --> 09:15.180
I mean, I'll do16 or 17 next time.

09:23.563 --> 09:26.483
You c--you can't expect me

09:26.483 --> 09:29.736
to turn onlike a faucet, you know.

09:32.990 --> 09:35.534
At least try to seduce mea little.

09:42.165 --> 09:44.459
- Batten down the hatches, Seattleites.

09:44.459 --> 09:46.378
We've got a big storm system  blowing in from the west,

09:46.378 --> 09:48.130
a bit of lightning and thunder

09:48.130 --> 09:51.258
with wind gusts expected  to get 60 miles per hour.

10:08.608 --> 10:10.193
- Aren't you a littleunderdressed?

10:10.193 --> 10:11.903
- It's Saturday.

10:11.903 --> 10:14.781
- You look like a little boy.- Who do I have to impress?

10:14.781 --> 10:16.199
The broker works for us.

10:16.199 --> 10:18.618
- What about me?- Honey, we're married.

10:18.618 --> 10:21.706
- Hello, Drew. Hello, Colin.It's good to see you again.

10:21.706 --> 10:23.331
Your contractor'salready here.

10:23.331 --> 10:25.625
- It looks worse than last week.

10:25.625 --> 10:28.045
- Oh, it just needsa little TLC.

10:28.045 --> 10:29.838
It's got good bones.

10:29.838 --> 10:31.631
- It's great to find somethingthat hasn't been ruined

10:31.631 --> 10:33.676
by a spec developer.

10:33.676 --> 10:36.679
- It's gonna need a ton of work.- It's cosmetic.

10:36.679 --> 10:38.388
That's whyit's such a good deal.

10:38.388 --> 10:40.557
This locationand the water view...

10:40.557 --> 10:42.517
it's got endless possibilities.

10:42.517 --> 10:44.895
You just needa little imagination.

10:47.690 --> 10:48.982
Oh.

10:50.734 --> 10:53.195
- Gonna need to replaceall the windows.

10:53.195 --> 10:55.655
But you don't need to use wood.Vinyl is cheaper.

10:55.655 --> 10:58.784
- Vinyl is weird.- Well, I recommend composite.

10:58.784 --> 11:00.660
It's not vinyl,and it's not wood,

11:00.660 --> 11:02.913
but it looks like wood,and it lasts forever.

11:02.913 --> 11:05.624
- If it's not vinyland it's not wood,

11:05.624 --> 11:08.293
then what is it?

11:08.293 --> 11:10.170
- Composite.

11:11.880 --> 11:14.717
- Overall,what do you think?

11:14.717 --> 11:16.843
- Oh, seems pretty sturdy...

11:16.843 --> 11:18.845
I mean, there could behidden conditions.

11:18.845 --> 11:21.389
I'd have to pull offsome of the siding.

11:21.389 --> 11:24.518
But, uh, let's see.

11:30.816 --> 11:33.985
- It's so peaceful and quiet.

11:33.985 --> 11:35.737
- Country livingclose to the city.

11:35.737 --> 11:37.739
There's history here too.

11:37.739 --> 11:40.743
This house was rented one summerby Courtney Love.

11:40.743 --> 11:42.745
- Okay, so, roughly, ballpark,

11:42.745 --> 11:44.538
what's it gonna taketo clean this up?

11:44.538 --> 11:46.790
- Top of my head, um...

11:46.790 --> 11:50.210
$200 a square foot,depending on finishes.

11:50.210 --> 11:51.461
- Really?

11:51.461 --> 11:55.465
$200 a foot,2,500 square feet.

11:55.465 --> 11:59.010
That's $500,000.

11:59.010 --> 12:00.763
- You can financethe home improvements

12:00.763 --> 12:03.140
along with the purchase price.

13:06.453 --> 13:07.954
- Here we go. Here we go.- So cool.

13:07.954 --> 13:11.458
- Congratulationson your new home.

13:12.792 --> 13:15.462
Oh! Oh! Wow!

14:16.815 --> 14:18.067
- Oh, my God.

14:18.067 --> 14:20.026
- Jesus.

14:20.026 --> 14:22.071
- Ooh.

14:35.250 --> 14:37.877
Whoa!

14:39.879 --> 14:41.881
- It's all right.

14:41.881 --> 14:44.092
It's their tree,so it's okay.

15:02.068 --> 15:05.322
- So you just closedyesterday?

15:06.991 --> 15:10.285
Boy, are you screwed.

15:10.285 --> 15:15.124
I'm just kidding.You're totally covered.

15:15.124 --> 15:16.458
- Tear it down.

15:16.458 --> 15:18.084
It's a no-brainer.

15:18.084 --> 15:20.086
It'd be cheaper to build new.

15:20.086 --> 15:21.880
- Where do we begin?

15:21.880 --> 15:24.133
- Oh, there's an architectnamed Ray Jenkins,

15:24.133 --> 15:26.135
does a lot of work in the area.

15:26.135 --> 15:27.886
I built a house of his downon Fulton Road.

15:27.886 --> 15:29.137
- Ah.

15:53.162 --> 15:54.954
- Is this a house?

16:08.510 --> 16:10.762
- I'm Putnam Hatch,  and I find it ironic

16:10.762 --> 16:12.639
that I'm known less  for the Hatch Foundation

16:12.639 --> 16:14.557
than I am  for the Hatch House--

16:14.557 --> 16:16.393
my private residence  designed by the firm

16:16.393 --> 16:17.769
of Sullivan and Moss.

16:17.769 --> 16:19.437
Now, the Hatch Foundation

16:19.437 --> 16:22.148
is actually a global  philanthropic organization--

16:40.250 --> 16:42.211
- Hello?

16:42.211 --> 16:44.046
- Yes.

16:44.046 --> 16:48.675
- Hi, I'm--I'm lookingfor the architect Leo Sullivan.

16:48.675 --> 16:50.510
- Why?

16:50.510 --> 16:55.223
- I saw a house that he designedat 299 Fulton Road.

16:55.223 --> 16:57.267
- I designed that house.

16:57.267 --> 17:00.061
- Are you Leo Sullivan?

17:00.061 --> 17:02.147
- Sullivan is dead.

17:02.147 --> 17:04.191
- Oh, um...

17:04.191 --> 17:06.151
Who am I speaking to?

17:06.151 --> 17:07.193
- Miles Moss.

17:28.214 --> 17:31.843
- It's so exciting to meet you.- Really?

17:31.843 --> 17:33.887
- I just love the houseon Fulton Road.

17:33.887 --> 17:36.848
- Oh, thank you.

17:36.848 --> 17:39.017
Here it is.We call it the Hatch House.

17:39.017 --> 17:41.270
- Oh.- Please.

17:41.270 --> 17:42.729
- You're here all alone here?

17:42.729 --> 17:44.606
- The firm is transitioning.

17:44.606 --> 17:47.066
I apologize if I soundedcryptic on the phone.

17:47.066 --> 17:49.861
Mr. Sullivan diedunexpectedly three months ago

17:49.861 --> 17:52.447
and, uh, lefta lot of creditors.

17:52.447 --> 17:53.948
- He was your partner?

17:53.948 --> 17:56.743
- Leo's role was moreon the business side.

17:56.743 --> 18:00.371
As it turns out, my confidencein him was misplaced.

18:00.371 --> 18:03.833
I am so glad that you likethe Hatch House.

18:03.833 --> 18:05.710
I had a wonderful client,Putnam Hatch.

18:05.710 --> 18:07.296
- Mm.

18:07.296 --> 18:09.464
- Anytime I've ever doneanything good,

18:09.464 --> 18:11.883
it's because I've hada wonderful client.

18:11.883 --> 18:15.011
- What makesa wonderful client?

18:15.011 --> 18:17.013
- Someone who inspires me.

18:19.015 --> 18:21.684
Can I?

18:21.684 --> 18:26.273
As an architect, I have the jobof transforming hopes and dreams

18:26.273 --> 18:29.317
into wood, glass,steel, and concrete.

18:29.317 --> 18:32.070
But if the dreamsaren't there,

18:32.070 --> 18:34.572
there's very littleI can do.

18:34.572 --> 18:37.784
There will never bea great architect

18:37.784 --> 18:39.869
without a great client.

18:42.121 --> 18:45.124
- I can tell by your styleyou're a creative person.

18:45.124 --> 18:46.793
You appreciatethe process.

18:46.793 --> 18:48.294
- Yeah, I do.

18:48.294 --> 18:49.879
- It's very satisfying

18:49.879 --> 18:53.591
when a clientgets as excited as I do.

18:53.591 --> 18:55.593
- Do all architectsstart by drawing?

18:55.593 --> 18:57.136
- Many prefer the computer,

18:57.136 --> 18:59.138
I'm old school.

18:59.138 --> 19:01.015
With a pen and paper,I'm free.

19:01.015 --> 19:05.103
I could redesign the entire cityof Paris in half an hour.

19:05.103 --> 19:07.438
- You mentioned your fatherwas an architect.

19:07.438 --> 19:11.067
- Called himselfan old-fashioned modernist.

19:11.067 --> 19:12.902
The modernistshad this absurd idea

19:12.902 --> 19:16.864
that you could heal the worldthrough architecture.

19:16.864 --> 19:19.158
Of course,that's impossible.

19:19.158 --> 19:24.289
Nobody expects architectsto have grand visions anymore.

19:24.289 --> 19:26.958
What a shame.

19:26.958 --> 19:28.293
- Hmm.

20:41.991 --> 20:43.284
- Miles.

20:43.284 --> 20:45.161
- I just love the way

20:45.161 --> 20:47.664
you combine vintageand contemporary.

20:47.664 --> 20:49.248
- Oh, thanks.

20:49.248 --> 20:52.294
Miles, I'd like youto meet my husband, Colin Stone.

20:52.294 --> 20:53.461
- Miles Moss.

20:53.461 --> 20:55.338
- That's quite the houseat 299 Fulton.

20:55.338 --> 20:57.507
- Thank you.We call it the Hatch House.

20:57.507 --> 20:59.258
- It's namedafter the client.

20:59.258 --> 21:00.968
- That's traditionallyhow it works.

21:00.968 --> 21:03.347
Whatever you build herewill be called the Stone House.

21:03.347 --> 21:04.430
- Huh.

21:04.430 --> 21:07.309
Oh, Mr. Hatch must bea wealthy man.

21:07.309 --> 21:08.935
- People assume

21:08.935 --> 21:11.187
that interesting architectureis expensive,

21:11.187 --> 21:13.272
but it's not necessarily so.

21:13.272 --> 21:17.276
There are a lot of new andinnovative materials out there.

21:17.276 --> 21:18.945
- So how would youdescribe your style?

21:18.945 --> 21:20.738
Who are your influences?

21:20.738 --> 21:23.199
- Influenceis a difficult subject for me.

21:23.199 --> 21:25.118
I, uh, try to avoid it.

21:25.118 --> 21:27.537
It would be a nightmareif I started to think about it

21:27.537 --> 21:29.497
It would just tie my hands.

21:29.497 --> 21:31.749
None of us invented the house.

21:31.749 --> 21:34.711
That happenedthousands of years ago.

21:34.711 --> 21:37.880
Remarkable property.-

21:37.880 --> 21:40.509
Yeah, I must admit, as muchas I loved the old house,

21:40.509 --> 21:43.345
I feel we havea tremendous opportunity.

21:43.345 --> 21:45.472
- Oh, I agree--a tremendous opportunity!

21:45.472 --> 21:48.057
- Let's say we wanteda 3,000-square-foot house,

21:48.057 --> 21:50.017
four bedroom,three bath.

21:50.017 --> 21:52.729
Ballpark, what's thatgonna set us back?

21:52.729 --> 21:55.440
- That's a bit like saying youwant to marry a woman

21:55.440 --> 21:57.942
who's 5'6" and 125 pounds.

21:57.942 --> 21:59.736
Many women would fitthe criteria,

21:59.736 --> 22:01.279
but you wouldn't love them.

22:01.279 --> 22:05.367
What's more importantis designing a house

22:05.367 --> 22:08.286
to suit your needs.

22:08.286 --> 22:09.495
- And our budget.

22:09.495 --> 22:11.540
- Well, yes,that's one of your needs.

22:11.540 --> 22:13.375
But beyond budget,you have other needs--

22:13.375 --> 22:16.002
your hopes, your dreams.

22:16.002 --> 22:19.046
I need to learn those things.

22:19.046 --> 22:22.133
My process begins with a periodof intense communication.

22:22.133 --> 22:25.470
I need to find outwho you are, deep down.

22:25.470 --> 22:27.847
What are your eating habits,your bathing habits,

22:27.847 --> 22:30.349
your sleeping habits,and privacy needs?

22:30.349 --> 22:33.269
- - The more open you are,

22:33.269 --> 22:36.814
the more inputI have to work with.

22:36.814 --> 22:38.274
Important consideration--

22:38.274 --> 22:42.361
will the family growand change over time?

22:42.361 --> 22:44.739
- On a practical side,you know, we can't just think

22:44.739 --> 22:47.576
about what appealsto Colin and Drew.

22:47.576 --> 22:49.368
We've got to thinkabout the resale value.

22:49.368 --> 22:51.037
You know, most peopledon't stay in a house

22:51.037 --> 22:52.497
for more than 7 years.

22:52.497 --> 22:54.416
- What?That's crazy.

22:54.416 --> 22:55.875
- It's true. Look it up.- Really?

22:55.875 --> 22:58.503
- Again, the assumptionis that innovative architecture

22:58.503 --> 23:01.672
must not only be expensivebut impractical.

23:01.672 --> 23:03.716
I find the opposite is true.

23:10.474 --> 23:13.976
- He's odd.- I like him.

23:55.434 --> 23:56.936
I'm tired, honey.

23:56.936 --> 23:58.479
I rode 34 miles today.

23:58.479 --> 24:01.858
I just kind of wantto relax, you know?

24:01.858 --> 24:04.277
- We have to have sexto make a baby.

24:04.277 --> 24:07.113
- Well, can you--can you adda little more pressure

24:07.113 --> 24:10.659
to the situation?

24:10.659 --> 24:12.827
I got a full plate at work.

24:12.827 --> 24:14.787
We just made a hugeinvestment in this house.

24:14.787 --> 24:17.666
Now we have to builda whole new one.

24:19.709 --> 24:21.503
He makes me uncomfortable.

24:21.503 --> 24:23.045
He's too much of an "artist."

24:23.045 --> 24:24.589
What if we don't likewhat he comes up with?

24:24.589 --> 24:27.008
- He's an amazinglycreative person.

24:27.008 --> 24:30.261
He has fresh ideasthat we would never think of.

24:30.261 --> 24:32.471
Why can't you be more supportiveof his creativity?

24:32.471 --> 24:34.390
- Because it's all egoand vanity--that's why.

24:34.390 --> 24:35.516
And I'm telling you--

24:35.516 --> 24:37.310
that's going to show upin added cost.

24:37.310 --> 24:38.477
- He just...

24:38.477 --> 24:42.481
He thinks differently.

24:42.481 --> 24:46.485
I wish I could getinside his head for just a day.

24:46.485 --> 24:47.945
I like the chemistrybetween us.

24:47.945 --> 24:49.363
- Oh, chemistry.

24:49.363 --> 24:50.781
Drew, we have gotto think practically here.

24:50.781 --> 24:52.742
What if we want to sellin a few years?

24:52.742 --> 24:54.535
You do not want to beupside down on a mortgage.

24:54.535 --> 24:55.912
- Why are you talkingabout selling

24:55.912 --> 24:57.539
when we haven't evenbuilt it yet?

24:57.539 --> 24:59.206
Why?

24:59.206 --> 25:00.958
- You know, and I don't likethe idea of separate interviews.

25:00.958 --> 25:02.543
What if we contradicteach other?

25:02.543 --> 25:05.046
If I wanted to talk to somebodyabout my feelings,

25:05.046 --> 25:06.547
I'd hire a therapist,not an architect.

25:06.547 --> 25:08.257
- Maybe you should.

25:08.257 --> 25:09.926
- Hey, you know whosean architect?

25:09.926 --> 25:12.845
Elizabeth's brother-in-law.We should call him.

25:12.845 --> 25:15.765
- No.

25:15.765 --> 25:19.185
- This was a spec housein Renton.

25:19.185 --> 25:21.312
We were supposed to dothree others,

25:21.312 --> 25:25.191
but the developer went broke,and the bank foreclosed.

25:25.191 --> 25:27.944
Here's a car wash in Everett.

25:31.948 --> 25:33.783
That was a good project.

25:33.783 --> 25:36.202
- What makes a good project?

25:36.202 --> 25:40.749
- When you get paid on time.

25:40.749 --> 25:42.541
Uh, this client wanteda French chateau,

25:42.541 --> 25:47.046
so we didan authentic reproduction.

25:52.551 --> 25:54.804
Elizabeth sends her regards.

26:09.193 --> 26:13.155
- Well, I now haveboth proposals.

26:13.155 --> 26:14.741
Guess who's cheaper.

26:16.575 --> 26:18.786
Miles Moss.

26:23.249 --> 26:25.794
- Here's my studio.

26:25.794 --> 26:28.546
- Aha.

26:37.263 --> 26:38.723
- Oh, don't look too closely.

26:38.723 --> 26:42.435
It's just a hobbyI do for fun.

26:42.435 --> 26:45.771
- What we do for funis what really matters.

26:45.771 --> 26:47.314
Art only has meaning

26:47.314 --> 26:50.819
if the process comesfrom an inner compulsion.

26:50.819 --> 26:52.319
- I wouldn't call it art.

26:54.071 --> 26:57.867
- This is my process...

26:57.867 --> 27:01.078
getting to knowyou and Colin.

27:01.078 --> 27:02.663
You're a creative person.

27:02.663 --> 27:06.751
You understand the dialoguebetween client and architect

27:06.751 --> 27:09.920
is an intimate one.

27:09.920 --> 27:12.548
When you talk about building,you're talking about...

27:12.548 --> 27:15.342
dreams.

27:15.342 --> 27:17.428
You must never let yourselfbe overwhelmed

27:17.428 --> 27:19.680
by a rational analysis.

27:19.680 --> 27:23.642
When we're talkingabout a house, a room, a space,

27:23.642 --> 27:25.811
it's not somethingthat you think.

27:25.811 --> 27:29.440
It's something that you feel.

27:29.440 --> 27:32.861
- My--my main concernis separation.

27:34.738 --> 27:36.655
I need my own space.

27:36.655 --> 27:37.907
- Of course.

27:37.907 --> 27:39.784
There must be a placefor solitude.

27:39.784 --> 27:41.077
A couple can't be together

27:41.077 --> 27:42.787
if they have no placeto be alone.

27:42.787 --> 27:45.331
- Colin'suncomfortable alone.

27:45.331 --> 27:48.501
So the TV stays onto keep him company.

27:48.501 --> 27:49.878
- Many people avoid solitude.

27:49.878 --> 27:51.670
It's...

27:51.670 --> 27:55.382
Frightening to be alonewith your thoughts.

27:55.382 --> 27:57.093
You may findthere are none.

28:04.851 --> 28:06.519
Do you intendto have children?

28:06.519 --> 28:08.813
- We're trying, yeah.

28:08.813 --> 28:12.108
Our--our genes may not match.

28:12.108 --> 28:15.319
- Well, it's an importantconsideration.

28:15.319 --> 28:16.904
The couple needsto have privacy,

28:16.904 --> 28:18.907
so their children can havea place of their own

28:18.907 --> 28:20.533
so they don't driveeveryone crazy.

28:35.673 --> 28:37.675
- Oh, that's beautiful,isn't it?

28:39.760 --> 28:41.887
- The nautilus shell...

28:43.932 --> 28:47.811
A symbol that goes backto the ancient Hindus.

28:48.978 --> 28:53.399
- The golden ratio.- Exactly.

28:53.399 --> 28:57.486
Plato called itthe key to the cosmos.

28:57.486 --> 29:00.447
From the structureof the human skeleton

29:00.447 --> 29:03.033
to the patternon sunflowers seeds,

29:03.033 --> 29:04.660
the ratio is there--

29:04.660 --> 29:09.123
seemingly a geometrical patternfor life itself.

29:26.473 --> 29:30.144
- Look, the golden ratio.It's everywhere.

29:30.144 --> 29:31.938
- Ah.

29:40.362 --> 29:42.656
- Accumulated benefits.

29:42.656 --> 29:44.450
Right,during the absorption period,

29:44.450 --> 29:45.993
the debt is dividedinto a series

29:45.993 --> 29:47.996
of staggered maturities.

29:47.996 --> 29:49.747
Right.

29:49.747 --> 29:51.457
No problem.

29:51.457 --> 29:53.959
Look, if Drew answersquestions differently than me,

29:53.959 --> 29:55.836
it doesn't mean we disagree.- What does it mean?

29:55.836 --> 29:58.797
- It means we haven't hada chance to talk about it yet.

29:58.797 --> 30:01.467
Sometimes she doesn't thinka thing through logically.

30:01.467 --> 30:02.801
The point is,we know what we want.

30:02.801 --> 30:04.470
- Of course.You could design it yourself.

30:04.470 --> 30:06.055
You just need someoneto draw up the plans.

30:06.055 --> 30:08.016
- No, I--

30:08.016 --> 30:09.266
- It's like someonewho has no knowledge of fashion

30:09.266 --> 30:10.517
but wanted to design a suit

30:10.517 --> 30:12.603
It would bean amorphous sack.

30:12.603 --> 30:14.480
- All I'm saying is,

30:14.480 --> 30:15.981
we want to make surewe get what we want.

30:15.981 --> 30:17.524
- Well, that's whywe're here, Colon.

30:17.524 --> 30:19.861
I'm trying to determinewhat you want.

30:19.861 --> 30:21.904
- It's "Colin."

30:21.904 --> 30:24.823
Colon is the large intestine.

30:24.823 --> 30:27.451
- Forgive my accent.

30:27.451 --> 30:30.412
- One thing I want for sureis plenty of storage space.

30:30.412 --> 30:32.498
- Now, is that the first thingthat comes to mind?

30:32.498 --> 30:35.919
- It's an important featurethat's easily overlooked.

30:35.919 --> 30:39.255
Also, I want a whole-housemulti-zone audio system,

30:39.255 --> 30:42.841
you know, so I can listento my music in any room

30:42.841 --> 30:46.053
while she listens to her musicin another room.

30:46.053 --> 30:49.890
- When did music becomeso personalized?

30:49.890 --> 30:53.894
It's funny how technologybest serves mediocrity.

30:55.521 --> 30:57.523
- I want a flat-screen TVin the toilet

30:57.523 --> 30:59.901
so I can watchthe stock reports.

30:59.901 --> 31:00.901
- Check.

31:00.901 --> 31:02.904
- All the TVsshould be mounted flush.

31:02.904 --> 31:04.822
That has to beplanned for, right?

31:04.822 --> 31:06.824
'Cause you got to make sure thatthey're recessed into the walls.

31:06.824 --> 31:08.909
Shouldn't--shouldn'tyou write this down?

31:08.909 --> 31:11.328
- I just want to takea step back,

31:11.328 --> 31:13.957
go a little deeper.

31:13.957 --> 31:17.960
What is itthat you really want?

31:22.256 --> 31:25.342
- Some friends put ina voice-activated butler system

31:25.342 --> 31:27.594
that performsall these household tasks.

31:27.594 --> 31:28.887
You know, you can call...

31:28.887 --> 31:30.597
from the freeway,and it starts the sauna.

31:30.597 --> 31:31.890
Is that the kind of thing--

31:31.890 --> 31:33.350
Hey, Jim.

31:33.350 --> 31:37.104
Basic structureis where all the investors

31:37.104 --> 31:39.898
owning a sequential-pay mortgageinvestment conduit

31:39.898 --> 31:42.109
receivedinterest payments.

31:42.109 --> 31:44.945
Yeah, the principal receivedfrom the underlying mortgages

31:44.945 --> 31:47.990
repays each tranchein a predetermined order.

31:47.990 --> 31:51.535
Right. No problem.

31:51.535 --> 31:53.412
Sorry.

31:53.412 --> 31:55.957
- Our work has becomeso specialized, hasn't it?

31:55.957 --> 31:58.584
People know more and moreabout less and less.

31:58.584 --> 32:00.419
- Yeah.

32:00.419 --> 32:03.922
S-shouldn't we bemore systematic here,

32:03.922 --> 32:06.134
you know, make a listof things we like and don't like

32:06.134 --> 32:07.760
about our current house?

32:07.760 --> 32:10.679
- If you want, but we couldalso use our imaginations

32:10.679 --> 32:12.973
and dream of what our newhouse could be.

32:12.973 --> 32:15.601
You--you must have dreamsfor your new house.

32:15.601 --> 32:16.935
- Yes, I do. I dream.

32:16.935 --> 32:19.396
I dream that we don't goover-budget, you know.

32:19.396 --> 32:21.607
I dream that the placeis re-saleable

32:21.607 --> 32:23.400
and I don't lose my shirt.

32:23.400 --> 32:25.944
- And yet you're asking fora voice-activated butler system.

32:25.944 --> 32:27.946
- No, no, no, I researchedthe butler system.

32:27.946 --> 32:30.033
It's surprisingly affordable.

32:30.033 --> 32:33.160
Look, this isn'trocket science, you know.

32:33.160 --> 32:35.579
For one thing, we havethis great view of the water.

32:35.579 --> 32:38.374
Just put up a wall of glassand frame the view.

32:38.374 --> 32:41.418
- Nothing spoils a view so muchas huge windows

32:41.418 --> 32:43.420
that gape at it incessantly.

32:43.420 --> 32:46.840
It's better to glimpse itas you pass by.

32:46.840 --> 32:49.426
- I don't want to glimpse it.I want to see it.

32:49.426 --> 32:53.305
It's a big viewfrom a house on a hill.

32:53.305 --> 32:55.141
- A house shouldnever be on  a hill.

32:55.141 --> 32:57.434
A house shouldn't be on  anything.

32:57.434 --> 32:59.311
A house should be of  the hill.

32:59.311 --> 33:01.230
Hill and houseliving together,

33:01.230 --> 33:03.857
each the happierfor the other.

33:03.857 --> 33:06.402
- Yeah.

33:06.402 --> 33:09.446
Look, uh, Miles,here's my concern.

33:09.446 --> 33:11.990
You're, um--you're an artist,

33:11.990 --> 33:14.160
and I'm just--I don't know

33:14.160 --> 33:17.746
that your visionreflects our needs.

33:17.746 --> 33:19.456
- Rest assured--I find the client can be

33:19.456 --> 33:21.458
a significant design resource.

33:21.458 --> 33:23.335
They sometimesmake wonderful suggestions.

33:23.335 --> 33:25.045
- Thank you.Don't forget--

33:25.045 --> 33:26.880
we're the onesthat have to live there.

33:26.880 --> 33:29.133
We have to pay for it.We have to be rational.

33:29.133 --> 33:30.717
- I understand completely.

33:30.717 --> 33:32.928
Rationalismis the enemy of art,

33:32.928 --> 33:35.055
but is necessary as a basisfor architecture.

33:35.055 --> 33:36.223
- It certainly is.

33:36.223 --> 33:38.016
- A work of artis revolutionary.

33:38.016 --> 33:39.518
A house is conservative.

33:39.518 --> 33:40.936
- That's right.

33:40.936 --> 33:43.021
- A house must satisfya requirement.

33:43.021 --> 33:45.023
A work of art does not.

33:45.023 --> 33:46.316
- I'm gladwe're on the same page.

33:46.316 --> 33:49.403
- A house is designedto provide comfort.

33:49.403 --> 33:50.904
A work of artwants to draw people

33:50.904 --> 33:53.031
out of their comfort zone.- Exactly.

33:53.031 --> 33:55.951
- That is why people love housesand hate art.

33:55.951 --> 33:56.952
- Yes.

33:56.952 --> 33:58.537
No, I don't hate art.

33:58.537 --> 34:00.998
- Only a small partof architecture belongs

34:00.998 --> 34:02.166
to the realm of art--

34:02.166 --> 34:05.210
the monument and the tomb.

34:05.210 --> 34:08.005
Everything elsehas a function.

34:08.005 --> 34:10.716
I believeit is just as important

34:10.716 --> 34:13.010
to design a chicken coop

34:13.010 --> 34:16.722
as it isto design a cathedral.

34:31.320 --> 34:34.531
We're roughly at the heightof the second story.

34:37.118 --> 34:39.077
- A blank canvas.

34:39.077 --> 34:41.996
Where do you begin?

35:22.079 --> 35:24.540
- I got something for you.

35:24.540 --> 35:26.458
- Oh.

35:26.458 --> 35:28.460
- I want youto start noticing things,

35:28.460 --> 35:30.338
little details that contribute

35:30.338 --> 35:32.756
towards how a spacemakes you feel.

35:32.756 --> 35:34.299
Drawing is betterthan taking photos.

35:34.299 --> 35:38.720
It forces you to lookmore closely at things.

35:45.978 --> 35:47.980
- Nobody talksabout these things.

35:47.980 --> 35:50.274
It's like a big secretand they only let you in on it

35:50.274 --> 35:52.276
once you have children.

35:52.276 --> 35:55.153
- Where's your sweater, Max?Did you leave it in your cubby?

35:55.153 --> 35:56.863
- What's a cubby?

35:56.863 --> 35:59.283
- I can't believeyou don't know what a cubby is.

35:59.283 --> 36:01.660
When did youstart sketching?

36:01.660 --> 36:03.495
- I'm taking notesfor my architect.

36:03.495 --> 36:07.499
- "My architect."Drew has her very own architect.

36:07.499 --> 36:08.792
- He's...

36:08.792 --> 36:11.628
so inspiring.- Oh.

36:11.628 --> 36:14.006
- It's like I'm seeing things

36:14.006 --> 36:18.552
in a completely new way.

36:18.552 --> 36:22.223
I love my architect.

36:22.223 --> 36:25.976
- Does Colinlove your architect?

36:25.976 --> 36:29.354
- Colin is suspiciousof creativity.

36:31.773 --> 36:33.400
- Hey, are we gettingtogether Wednesday?

36:33.400 --> 36:35.652
I have a facial at 9:00and a laser appointment at 4:00,

36:35.652 --> 36:37.362
but other than that,I'm pretty open.

36:37.362 --> 36:39.865
Emma's doing my nails at 1:00.What about late afternoon?

36:39.865 --> 36:41.533
I have 6:30 yoga.Thursday?

36:41.533 --> 36:43.744
- No, I do weight trainingThursday mornings,

36:43.744 --> 36:45.621
but the afternoon is free.

36:45.621 --> 36:47.289
- I'm getting my hair coloredthen I have therapy. Friday?

37:12.939 --> 37:16.026
- Any recent changesin your health?

37:16.026 --> 37:19.363
- No.- Any big life changes--

37:19.363 --> 37:22.115
new job,death in the family?

37:22.115 --> 37:23.909
- No.

37:23.909 --> 37:26.286
- We're building a house.

37:26.286 --> 37:29.915
- Ooh, that's exciting.It can also be stressful.

37:29.915 --> 37:32.000
Drew, everythingis within range.

37:32.000 --> 37:34.419
Colin,your testosterone is low.

37:34.419 --> 37:36.630
Levels tend to drop offafter age 35.

37:36.630 --> 37:38.424
We want to try to raise it.

37:38.424 --> 37:40.468
As with any hormone treatment,there are side effects.

37:40.468 --> 37:43.470
The most prevalentis increased sex drive.

37:43.470 --> 37:45.931
Do you thinkyou can handle that?

37:50.353 --> 37:52.270
- Yeah...

37:52.270 --> 37:55.857
- Seriously, though,stress can be a factor.

37:55.857 --> 37:58.276
You're building a house--big financial commitment,

37:58.276 --> 38:00.278
countless decisions to be made.

38:00.278 --> 38:02.322
The pressurecan affect fertility.

38:02.322 --> 38:04.491
Think about the message thatyou're sending to your body.

38:04.491 --> 38:06.785
From an evolutionary standpoint,

38:06.785 --> 38:09.413
your body knows that a periodof extreme stress

38:09.413 --> 38:11.498
is not an ideal timeto get pregnant.

38:11.498 --> 38:13.291
- Well, what do yousuggest we do?

38:13.291 --> 38:15.377
- Try to ease upon your work schedule.

38:15.377 --> 38:17.671
- W-work is not stressful.

38:17.671 --> 38:19.798
This--this is stressful.- She's trying to help.

38:19.798 --> 38:24.219
Maybe if you cut back on your50-mile rides and paddles.

38:24.219 --> 38:25.762
- It could just bebad timing.

38:25.762 --> 38:27.515
Two busy people havingintercourse

38:27.515 --> 38:29.766
once or twice a week--it's hit or miss.

38:29.766 --> 38:32.853
You can predict ovulationby calculating your next period

38:32.853 --> 38:36.524
and then counting back 14 days.

38:36.524 --> 38:39.276
- Oh. Well, maybemy app is wrong.

38:39.276 --> 38:43.989
It says day 14, not 19.

38:43.989 --> 38:47.284
- What, we had all that sexfor nothing?

38:47.284 --> 38:48.452
- You can purchase a test kit

38:48.452 --> 38:50.328
that'll give youadvanced warning.

38:50.328 --> 38:52.914
When the test is positive,have intercourse that night,

38:52.914 --> 38:56.877
the next night, the night afterand the night after that.

38:56.877 --> 39:00.338
Or forget aboutovulatory charts, mucus charts,

39:00.338 --> 39:02.048
and scheduled sex

39:02.048 --> 39:03.759
and let passion take over.

39:08.680 --> 39:10.474
- We're not using those.- Why not?

39:10.474 --> 39:11.725
He may recommend themto other clients.

39:11.725 --> 39:13.561
- I don't want to use them.

39:13.561 --> 39:15.521
I'm sick of them.No, we're not using them.

39:15.521 --> 39:17.147
- Maybe he'll recommend them.

39:17.147 --> 39:19.525
- No. I don't want to use them.I'm sick of them.

39:19.525 --> 39:21.902
Oh!

39:27.741 --> 39:30.994
- I don't know what you expectto learn by watching us eat.

39:33.580 --> 39:37.042
- I'm observing how you live...

39:37.042 --> 39:39.169
so that I can betterdesign your house.

39:39.169 --> 39:42.923
- Well, we wouldn't be behavinglike this if you weren't here.

39:42.923 --> 39:46.594
- That's the HeisenbergUncertainty Principle.

39:46.594 --> 39:49.555
You can't observe a thingwithout changing it.

39:49.555 --> 39:51.348
- Mm.

39:51.348 --> 39:53.558
- What do you thinkof the plates?

39:53.558 --> 39:56.061
Drew made them.

39:56.061 --> 39:58.772
- He knows that.- They're great, aren't they?

40:00.524 --> 40:02.609
- Of course.

40:05.237 --> 40:08.824
I can't help wondering whatyou'd do with a bigger canvas,

40:08.824 --> 40:12.118
express emotionsthat can't be contained

40:12.118 --> 40:14.913
on plates.

40:14.913 --> 40:16.832
- People need plates.They have a use.

40:16.832 --> 40:19.626
It's not just art, you know.You're providing a service.

40:24.881 --> 40:27.717
- What matters is that youenjoy the process.

40:27.717 --> 40:32.097
- I used to enjoy it.Now it's just work.

40:32.097 --> 40:35.476
- Most artists would behappy there was work.

40:35.476 --> 40:37.143
- He promotes meto all his colleagues.

40:37.143 --> 40:40.146
They provide color samplesfor me to match.

40:40.146 --> 40:41.481
- They didn't ask you to match.

40:41.481 --> 40:42.941
They simply wanted youto coordinate

40:42.941 --> 40:44.568
with their tableclothand napkins.

40:44.568 --> 40:48.154
- I don't want to be toldwhat colors to use.

40:48.154 --> 40:51.575
- Drew, they're tryingto put together a tabletop.

40:53.493 --> 40:55.579
- Fuck their tabletop.

40:59.958 --> 41:02.502
- The salad is excellent.

42:01.770 --> 42:04.189
- You're wearing your hairwith more abandon.

42:04.189 --> 42:05.482
I like it.

42:05.482 --> 42:07.484
- Thanks.

42:07.484 --> 42:10.528
You pick up on everything,don't you?

42:10.528 --> 42:13.323
- Everything of interest.

42:17.118 --> 42:19.245
- You can get that.I don't mind.

42:19.245 --> 42:21.748
- Oh, it'll goto voice mail.

42:37.931 --> 42:41.559
You see, an architectmust be many things--

42:41.559 --> 42:43.395
sculptor, artist,

42:43.395 --> 42:46.272
but before you can build,

42:46.272 --> 42:49.275
you must have an idea.

42:50.694 --> 42:52.153
- The nautilus shell.

42:52.153 --> 42:55.490
- It's classic,and it's curving.

42:55.490 --> 42:57.575
I like all of that.

42:57.575 --> 43:01.413
I'm not attracted toright angles and straight lines.

43:01.413 --> 43:05.166
They're hard and inflexibleand man-made.

43:05.166 --> 43:07.627
There are no right anglesin nature.

43:12.716 --> 43:17.178
- Ah, it must be so freeingto make such big gestures.

43:17.178 --> 43:20.140
My world is so small.

43:20.140 --> 43:23.226
- Well, here,I don't need all of this.

43:23.226 --> 43:24.812
It's a nice big piece.

43:24.812 --> 43:26.312
You can reallystretch out on it.

43:26.312 --> 43:27.605
- I'm a little intimidated

43:27.605 --> 43:30.818
by a big blank pieceof white paper.

43:30.818 --> 43:33.319
- Well, then paint it black.

43:36.322 --> 43:38.616
Look...

43:38.616 --> 43:40.118
a staircaseisn't just a way

43:40.118 --> 43:42.620
of gettingfrom one floor to another.

43:42.620 --> 43:45.708
It's a room in itself.

43:45.708 --> 43:48.543
You saw what we didat the Hatch House.

43:48.543 --> 43:50.336
- I was never inside.

43:50.336 --> 43:52.338
- Oh.

43:59.680 --> 44:03.058
- Incredible.

44:03.058 --> 44:04.852
- The resultof excellent chemistry

44:04.852 --> 44:08.063
between architect and client.

44:19.616 --> 44:21.201
- Oh, what are you doing?

44:21.201 --> 44:23.411
- Well...

44:23.411 --> 44:27.875
Putnam usually hasa decent bottle of wine

44:27.875 --> 44:30.085
in his cooler.

45:13.586 --> 45:14.879
- The sleeping space...

45:17.465 --> 45:20.969
The centerof a couple's life together,

45:20.969 --> 45:24.139
the placewhere they talk, sleep,

45:24.139 --> 45:26.934
sleep late...

45:26.934 --> 45:29.269
make love.

45:30.854 --> 45:33.899
- The center of my husband'slife is the bathroom.

45:35.400 --> 45:37.360
He spendsa lot of time there.

45:37.360 --> 45:39.404
- Well...

45:39.404 --> 45:41.823
that's understandable.

45:41.823 --> 45:44.826
Bathing is pleasurableand therapeutic.

45:44.826 --> 45:46.661
It's one of the simplest waysto unwind--

45:46.661 --> 45:50.123
the sensual contactwith water.

45:50.123 --> 45:52.750
It's oneof the precious times

45:52.750 --> 45:55.461
when we are absolutely alone

45:55.461 --> 45:59.967
and completely naked.

45:59.967 --> 46:02.760
- He just sits on the toilet.

46:09.350 --> 46:12.478
I have trouble sleeping.

46:12.478 --> 46:17.400
He insists on keeping the TV onin the bedroom.

46:17.400 --> 46:20.945
I have to waituntil he falls asleep

46:20.945 --> 46:23.156
to turn it off.

46:23.156 --> 46:26.201
I need a room of my own.

46:29.954 --> 46:34.626
- Architecture can't forcepeople to connect.

46:34.626 --> 46:37.880
It can only planthe crossing path,

46:37.880 --> 46:38.963
remove barriers,

46:38.963 --> 46:42.800
make the meeting placesmore inviting.

46:42.800 --> 46:44.969
- You always thinkof modern as cold.

46:44.969 --> 46:47.055
This is cozy.

46:47.055 --> 46:51.643
- The concept of cozy has alwaysbeen a problem for modernism.

46:51.643 --> 46:54.896
But it'sa major concern of mine...

46:54.896 --> 46:56.814
along with comfy.

47:01.027 --> 47:03.613
Yeah.

47:03.613 --> 47:06.241
A group of chairs,a sofa,

47:06.241 --> 47:08.826
a pile of cushions...

47:08.826 --> 47:12.580
to make that work is--it's very subtle.

47:12.580 --> 47:14.540
Most meeting placesare sterile.

47:14.540 --> 47:19.462
People avoid them.Nothing happens there.

47:19.462 --> 47:21.798
Others are...

47:21.798 --> 47:22.840
full of life.

47:22.840 --> 47:24.801
They...

47:24.801 --> 47:27.011
seem to attract people.

47:28.888 --> 47:32.017
People feel more...

47:34.811 --> 47:35.895
Alive.

47:51.869 --> 47:55.790
This arrangementis particularly successful.

48:59.354 --> 49:00.605
Oh.

49:00.605 --> 49:02.357
This is nice.

49:02.357 --> 49:04.692
- Mm-hmm.

49:04.692 --> 49:07.028
- You must have come home fromwork early to prep all this.

49:07.028 --> 49:10.157
- I did.Where were you?

49:10.157 --> 49:13.868
- Oh, I, uh...

49:13.868 --> 49:17.705
Miles showed me the insideof the Hatch House.

49:17.705 --> 49:19.874
- Really? I would have likedto have seen that.

49:19.874 --> 49:22.460
- You should.It's amazing.

49:22.460 --> 49:24.087
- Yeah?The owners were there?

49:24.087 --> 49:26.881
- No, um...

49:26.881 --> 49:29.675
You should really see it.You'd realize he's a genius.

49:29.675 --> 49:31.052
- Yeah, well, the problemwith geniuses

49:31.052 --> 49:32.929
is they're a painin the ass.

50:03.334 --> 50:05.670
- Oh.

50:05.670 --> 50:08.005
Mm.

50:10.883 --> 50:13.136
- Mike Conway,Conway Construction.

50:13.136 --> 50:15.012
- Miles Moss, architect.- Miles.

50:15.012 --> 50:17.723
- Hi.

50:17.723 --> 50:19.267
Looks likeit's clearing up.

50:19.267 --> 50:22.103
- Yes, this afternoon,if the forecast is reliable.

50:22.103 --> 50:24.897
- So, uh, this is...

50:27.024 --> 50:30.069
- I want you to knowthat Drew's contribution

50:30.069 --> 50:33.240
to the designhas been crucial.

50:33.240 --> 50:34.657
She has been my muse.

50:39.036 --> 50:42.165
- Oh, my God.

50:44.542 --> 50:47.087
Wow.

50:47.087 --> 50:49.922
- Wow.

50:56.971 --> 50:59.474
- The parking garage is here.

50:59.474 --> 51:02.144
You enter throughthe main doorway here

51:02.144 --> 51:06.397
into a floatingstairway space.

51:06.397 --> 51:09.233
It's a design ideainspired by Drew.

51:09.233 --> 51:12.403
- Can you really build thison our budget?

51:12.403 --> 51:16.699
- Well, I thinkthat's a question for Mike.

51:16.699 --> 51:18.784
- I have no idea what this is.

51:18.784 --> 51:20.870
Um, what's the skin?

51:20.870 --> 51:22.079
- Titanium, of course.

51:22.079 --> 51:24.081
- Titanium.- Yes.

51:24.081 --> 51:26.459
A magnificent metal--

51:26.459 --> 51:30.588
noble, mysterious, vital,

51:30.588 --> 51:33.133
just as Cronus,the first of the Titans

51:33.133 --> 51:35.927
who ruled over the earth,the heavens, and the sea.

51:35.927 --> 51:37.929
- Do you know a supplier?- Of course.

51:37.929 --> 51:40.473
- And a sub?- Yes, yes.

51:40.473 --> 51:42.683
Let me walk youthrough the floor plan.

51:48.606 --> 51:50.358
- There areno straight lines.

51:50.358 --> 51:53.778
- Straight lines are a symptomof the new illiteracy.

51:53.778 --> 51:56.197
It will lead to the downfallof human civilization.

51:56.197 --> 51:57.990
- People like straight walls,you know.

51:57.990 --> 51:59.325
They're--they're practical.

51:59.325 --> 52:01.160
You can--you can put furnitureup against them.

52:01.160 --> 52:04.914
- Squares and rectanglesmake no sense in human terms.

52:04.914 --> 52:07.542
They have a negative effecton social interaction.

52:07.542 --> 52:09.752
They only expressthe rigid desires of people

52:09.752 --> 52:12.004
who are too preoccupiedwith systems

52:12.004 --> 52:13.881
and their meansof production.

52:13.881 --> 52:15.716
The entire universeis curved.

52:15.716 --> 52:17.552
Einstein proved that.

52:17.552 --> 52:19.303
- Why don't you let himpresent his idea

52:19.303 --> 52:21.639
before criticizing it?

52:21.639 --> 52:23.307
- That's all right, Drew.

52:23.307 --> 52:26.228
I like clients to provide activeand aggressive criticism,

52:26.228 --> 52:28.396
as long as they haveabsolute faith in me.

52:28.396 --> 52:30.231
I find thatthe best work happens

52:30.231 --> 52:32.441
when everyone hasan open mind.

52:32.441 --> 52:35.195
Remember, you're payingfor my talent and experience.

52:35.195 --> 52:38.239
You're wasting moneyif you don't listen to my ideas.

52:38.239 --> 52:41.158
- All right.So where are the rooms?

52:41.158 --> 52:43.160
- The living spacesare here and here.

52:43.160 --> 52:44.829
The kitchen space is here.

52:44.829 --> 52:47.790
And these arethe sleeping spaces.

52:47.790 --> 52:49.166
- You mean bedrooms?

52:49.166 --> 52:51.210
- You could call them that.

52:51.210 --> 52:53.212
- What's this thing--this line here?

52:53.212 --> 52:54.672
Is this a wall?

52:54.672 --> 52:56.841
- Yes, it's madeof Quietstone.

52:56.841 --> 52:58.884
It's a soundproofing material.

52:58.884 --> 53:01.929
It's as thin as Sheetrock,but twice as sound resistant.

53:01.929 --> 53:04.390
It createscomplete separation.

53:04.390 --> 53:06.268
- Complete separationfrom what?

53:06.268 --> 53:09.353
- Your side of the housefrom Drew's side of the house.

53:09.353 --> 53:11.356
- Oh, I knew it.I knew it.

53:11.356 --> 53:14.734
I told you that doing separateinterviews w-was a mistake.

53:14.734 --> 53:16.278
Why don't you--Just build a duplex.

53:16.278 --> 53:17.945
We'll live next doorto each other.

53:17.945 --> 53:19.655
- I was just respondingto Drew's sound concerns

53:19.655 --> 53:21.365
and your music concerns.

53:21.365 --> 53:23.367
I think you're making moreof this than was intended.

53:23.367 --> 53:27.246
- All right, Mike, ballpark,what--what are we looking at?

53:29.081 --> 53:30.458
- I've gota thousand questions

53:30.458 --> 53:32.252
before I could give youa solid number,

53:32.252 --> 53:34.420
but I'd have to sayat least, uh...

53:34.420 --> 53:36.256
$500 a square foot.

53:36.256 --> 53:37.923
- Five hun--

53:37.923 --> 53:40.051
That's--that's overa million bucks!

53:40.051 --> 53:41.385
Are you out of your mind?

53:41.385 --> 53:43.220
- Mike, if you havea thousand questions,

53:43.220 --> 53:45.222
wouldn't it be good to getsome answers first

53:45.222 --> 53:47.224
before making wild guesses?

53:47.224 --> 53:50.061
- Um, where arethe load-bearing walls?

53:50.061 --> 53:53.439
- The loads are beingtransferred here, here...

53:53.439 --> 53:55.441
and here.

53:55.441 --> 53:57.818
- Well, I'm not telling youanything you don't already know,

53:57.818 --> 54:00.571
but it would be more efficientto stack them.

54:00.571 --> 54:02.198
- It would be more efficient,

54:02.198 --> 54:04.200
but they wouldn't be happyliving there.

54:05.576 --> 54:07.244
Now's the timeto make changes, folks.

54:07.244 --> 54:09.705
It's cheaper to use an eraseron the drafting board

54:09.705 --> 54:11.666
than it is a wrecking ballat the site.

54:11.666 --> 54:15.252
- We can't allow the engineeringto dictate the building's form.

54:15.252 --> 54:17.464
Structure hasto accommodate design.

54:17.464 --> 54:20.633
- Oh, okay, thank youfor your time, Miles.

54:20.633 --> 54:22.344
Send me your final bill.I will take care of it.

54:22.344 --> 54:24.095
- What? No.- Yes. No, we're done.

54:24.095 --> 54:26.472
- It's just a first pass.Nothing's set in stone.

54:26.472 --> 54:27.932
- Stone would be cheaper.

54:27.932 --> 54:29.433
- Most people findthat what they want

54:29.433 --> 54:31.811
is 50% overthe original budget.

54:31.811 --> 54:35.064
- What we  want? - Yes, what we  want.

54:36.358 --> 54:37.983
- Mike and Ineed to get together,

54:37.983 --> 54:39.527
go throughall his questions.

54:39.527 --> 54:41.445
There are alwaysless expensive alternatives,

54:41.445 --> 54:43.406
if need be.

54:43.406 --> 54:47.284
I find its better to negotiatethan pound my fist on the table.

54:47.284 --> 54:51.956
- This would save youa whole bunch right there.

54:51.956 --> 54:53.874
- Those roomswould be prisons

54:53.874 --> 54:56.711
for the peoplewho had to live in them.

54:56.711 --> 54:58.504
- I'm sure that Milescan come up

54:58.504 --> 55:01.298
with creative solutionsthat lower the cost,

55:01.298 --> 55:04.051
yet still maintainthe integrity of the design.

55:04.051 --> 55:05.512
- You know what?

55:05.512 --> 55:07.472
Give me a chanceto get together with Mike.

55:07.472 --> 55:09.348
We'll go through his questionsand come up with some options.

55:09.348 --> 55:11.726
- We can do that.

55:11.726 --> 55:13.477
- Fine. All right.

55:13.477 --> 55:16.313
Mike, I'll--I'll call you tomorrow.

55:16.313 --> 55:19.275
- - Bye, bye.

55:19.275 --> 55:20.735
- Where's my storage space?

55:20.735 --> 55:23.529
- Give me the luxuries of life,

55:23.529 --> 55:25.865
and I'll happily dowithout the necessities.

55:25.865 --> 55:29.285
- That makes no sense.Where's the bathroom?

55:29.285 --> 55:30.578
- You thinkI forgot bathrooms?

55:30.578 --> 55:32.372
- No, your bathroom here.

55:32.372 --> 55:34.999
- Oh, oh, it's, uh...

55:38.961 --> 55:40.337
- Yesterday was a big mistake.

55:40.337 --> 55:42.173
It's justcompletely ridiculous.

55:42.173 --> 55:44.550
- What do you mean"completely ridiculous"?

55:44.550 --> 55:46.428
- It won't happen again.

55:46.428 --> 55:47.970
I had a weak moment.

55:47.970 --> 55:49.764
- It's been a long time

55:49.764 --> 55:52.559
since I've connected with anyonethe way I connect with you.

55:52.559 --> 55:55.060
- Oh, no, I'm sorry, Miles.I just can't.

55:55.060 --> 55:57.438
It's not that I don't thinkyou're an amazing person.

55:57.438 --> 55:59.356
And I'm completelyattracted to you.

55:59.356 --> 56:02.234
But I just can't. I'm married.I don't want to hurt Colin.

56:02.234 --> 56:03.819
I don't want to hurt you.

56:03.819 --> 56:05.530
- Hurt me?- Yes.

56:05.530 --> 56:07.532
- You've made methe happiest man alive.

56:07.532 --> 56:10.284
- No, don't say that.I feel awful--just guilty.

56:10.284 --> 56:11.994
It's deceitful.

56:11.994 --> 56:13.454
- It's not your fault.I set you up.

56:13.454 --> 56:15.790
I've been in love with yousince we first met.

56:15.790 --> 56:18.543
- No. Don't say that.

56:18.543 --> 56:22.338
No, it's over.

56:29.762 --> 56:34.266
- You're his muse?How "amusing."

56:34.266 --> 56:37.353
You think I don't knowwhat's going on?

56:37.353 --> 56:39.814
You two have been meetingbehind my back...

56:39.814 --> 56:41.732
conspiring to makethis house more expensive

56:41.732 --> 56:43.067
and less re-saleable.

56:43.067 --> 56:44.735
Unless you can bringthis guy in line,

56:44.735 --> 56:47.279
we are goingin whole nother direction.

56:47.279 --> 56:50.407
A million dollars--that's insane.

56:55.621 --> 56:58.415
- Oh!

57:26.861 --> 57:28.404
- Drew,what are you doing?

57:28.404 --> 57:29.655
You're getting paintall over the floor!

57:29.655 --> 57:33.033
- It's an art studio.That happens.

57:33.033 --> 57:34.785
- How can youhear yourself think?

57:34.785 --> 57:36.704
- I'm not thinking.

57:36.704 --> 57:39.081
Don't do that!This is my room!

57:39.081 --> 57:40.583
- What has gotten into you?

57:40.583 --> 57:43.252
Why are you making such a mess?- Because I want to.

57:43.252 --> 57:46.130
Miles gave mea big sheet of paper,

57:46.130 --> 57:48.132
and I'm having fun.

57:48.132 --> 57:49.633
Is that allowed?

57:49.633 --> 57:51.927
- Oh, so, what?Now he's your muse?

57:51.927 --> 57:53.555
Is that it?

58:20.414 --> 58:24.084
- I designed it in a sequenceof natural curves,

58:24.084 --> 58:26.671
to flow inand out of the landscape.

58:26.671 --> 58:29.048
The contractor saysit's impractical.

58:29.048 --> 58:31.342
As if I had intendedpracticality.

58:31.342 --> 58:33.636
- We don't have to go backto the drawing board.

58:33.636 --> 58:35.930
We just have to bringdown the cost.

58:35.930 --> 58:37.556
- Why?

58:37.556 --> 58:40.476
Years from now, when you'reenjoying your beautiful home,

58:40.476 --> 58:42.519
you won't even rememberhow much it cost.

58:42.519 --> 58:45.189
- There must be wayswe can save.

58:46.523 --> 58:48.692
- Sure, sure.

58:48.692 --> 58:52.488
Take out the structural glass,put in a wall.

58:52.488 --> 58:56.576
Lose out the stone,carpet throughout.

58:56.576 --> 59:00.913
Replace the titaniumwith, God forbid, stucco!

59:00.913 --> 59:02.539
With a painter or sculptor,

59:02.539 --> 59:04.249
you wouldn't daresuggest alternatives,

59:04.249 --> 59:07.336
but an architect hasto put up with anything!

59:07.336 --> 59:09.714
Imagine trying to finda replacement

59:09.714 --> 59:13.133
for the touchand feel of titanium...

59:13.133 --> 59:16.470
the fabric of our lives.

59:16.470 --> 59:18.764
It's too badthat clients today

59:18.764 --> 59:22.685
aren't the committed patronsof the past.

59:22.685 --> 59:27.064
Now it's allabout return on investment.

59:27.064 --> 59:30.567
- You really thinkthat's my motivation?

59:30.567 --> 59:32.903
- It's your work, too.

59:32.903 --> 59:36.407
You're advocatingcutting your own ideas.

59:36.407 --> 59:38.742
You're submittingto arbitrary power,

59:38.742 --> 59:42.037
which has always,throughout history,

59:42.037 --> 59:46.917
crushed human sensibilityand truth.

59:46.917 --> 59:49.003
You've been colonized.

59:54.049 --> 59:56.552
- Every projecthas its limits.

59:57.845 --> 01:00:01.015
- You'll just have to findcreative solutions.

01:00:26.457 --> 01:00:29.501
- Fewer windows,uh, less square footage overall,

01:00:29.501 --> 01:00:31.128
big reductionin the structural glass--

01:00:31.128 --> 01:00:32.838
that's significant--

01:00:32.838 --> 01:00:35.507
no Quietstone.- Wow.

01:00:35.507 --> 01:00:37.009
I'm glad you've been ableto cut corners.

01:00:37.009 --> 01:00:38.719
- There are no corners.

01:00:38.719 --> 01:00:40.679
- I mean, it looks likeyou've made a genuine effort.

01:00:40.679 --> 01:00:42.765
- I want my clientsto be happy.

01:00:42.765 --> 01:00:44.349
- Mike,any other suggestions?

01:00:44.349 --> 01:00:46.769
- You could replacethe titanium with stucco.

01:00:46.769 --> 01:00:48.730
- Never.

01:00:48.730 --> 01:00:51.065
The Stone Housewill not be stucco!

01:00:51.065 --> 01:00:54.568
- I do like that--the Stone House.

01:00:56.195 --> 01:00:59.698
- Well, I'll, uh, runthis latest revision by the subs

01:00:59.698 --> 01:01:01.492
and get the final numbers.

01:01:01.492 --> 01:01:03.160
The cost reductionswill be significant, I think,

01:01:03.160 --> 01:01:04.661
but I have to say,

01:01:04.661 --> 01:01:06.622
it will still be morethan your original budget.

01:01:06.622 --> 01:01:09.083
- Well, hopefullysubsequent generations

01:01:09.083 --> 01:01:13.337
will find that the Stone Housewas worth the extra expense.

01:01:17.382 --> 01:01:19.885
- That's a yes.

01:01:23.388 --> 01:01:24.932
- - Come on, honey.

01:01:32.815 --> 01:01:33.690
Oh!

01:01:33.690 --> 01:01:34.775
both: Oh!

01:01:34.775 --> 01:01:37.152
- Ooh!- Oh!

01:01:41.782 --> 01:01:43.325
- Thank you.

01:01:43.325 --> 01:01:45.536
- Whoo!- Yay!

01:01:46.912 --> 01:01:48.956
- Oh, it will bea very quiet house

01:01:48.956 --> 01:01:51.876
if it's just the two of you.

01:01:51.876 --> 01:01:54.837
How old are you now,honey--39, 40?

01:01:54.837 --> 01:01:56.713
- I thought you saidyou never ask a woman's age.

01:01:56.713 --> 01:01:59.133
- Colin'sgetting up there too.

01:01:59.133 --> 01:02:01.468
You should takesome precautions.

01:02:01.468 --> 01:02:04.012
I've been doinga little research.

01:02:04.012 --> 01:02:06.181
We know a very good doctorwho can help you.

01:02:06.181 --> 01:02:09.309
He has a wonderful facilitywith an emergency backup system

01:02:09.309 --> 01:02:11.478
in casethere's a power outage.

01:02:11.478 --> 01:02:13.105
And his practiceisn't so big

01:02:13.105 --> 01:02:15.315
that you'd get lostin the shuffle.

01:02:15.315 --> 01:02:18.152
You know, if you'd like,I could make an appointment,

01:02:18.152 --> 01:02:20.863
and then you could,you know, go over

01:02:20.863 --> 01:02:23.949
and freeze some spermor harvest one or two eggs,

01:02:23.949 --> 01:02:25.784
and, you know,you wouldn't have to worry.

01:02:25.784 --> 01:02:27.954
You'd have a backup plan, youknow, just in case you need it.

01:02:27.954 --> 01:02:30.539
- Mom, is that dinnerconversation--sperm and eggs?

01:02:30.539 --> 01:02:32.749
- I'm sorry, honey.You're right.

01:02:32.749 --> 01:02:34.376
- And can we losethis flower arrangement?

01:02:34.376 --> 01:02:35.961
I can't see around it,over it.

01:02:35.961 --> 01:02:37.754
- They're beautiful.They're from our garden.

01:02:37.754 --> 01:02:40.048
- I know that,but I can't have a conversation.

01:02:40.048 --> 01:02:43.218
- And, you know, sweetheart,when the time is right,

01:02:43.218 --> 01:02:44.970
I know a wonderfulRussian nanny

01:02:44.970 --> 01:02:47.181
who costs a lot lessthan you would think.

01:02:47.181 --> 01:02:48.765
- Aren't you gettinga little ahead of yourself?

01:02:48.765 --> 01:02:51.351
- I'm just trying to help, okay?- I appreciate that.

01:02:51.351 --> 01:02:53.812
- She's gonna need her own room.You might as well plan for that.

01:02:53.812 --> 01:02:55.480
- We're not buildinga separate bedroom

01:02:55.480 --> 01:02:56.858
for a potential nanny

01:02:56.858 --> 01:02:58.817
to take careof potential children.

01:02:58.817 --> 01:03:00.485
- Right.

01:03:00.485 --> 01:03:03.823
The nanny can stayin the study.

01:03:03.823 --> 01:03:05.741
- How many bedrooms total?

01:03:05.741 --> 01:03:08.744
- They're sleeping spaces.- Huh?

01:03:08.744 --> 01:03:11.747
- There--there's one true bedroom

01:03:11.747 --> 01:03:15.459
and a space for a daybed.

01:03:15.459 --> 01:03:17.336
- Daybed?What's a daybed?

01:03:17.336 --> 01:03:20.047
You're spending a lot of money

01:03:20.047 --> 01:03:21.965
for a housewith only one bedroom?

01:03:21.965 --> 01:03:23.843
You're nuts!- Okay, Joseph.

01:03:23.843 --> 01:03:26.888
It's not your house. Let themmake their own mistakes.

01:03:26.888 --> 01:03:29.056
- The architectureis really quite special.

01:03:29.056 --> 01:03:32.976
He's--he's a genius.

01:03:32.976 --> 01:03:34.645
- Genius.Genius does not design

01:03:34.645 --> 01:03:36.605
a million-dollar housewith one bedroom.

01:03:36.605 --> 01:03:38.273
- I just don't understand

01:03:38.273 --> 01:03:39.858
why you didn't useElizabeth's brother-in-law.

01:03:39.858 --> 01:03:42.527
- The space for the daybed

01:03:42.527 --> 01:03:44.404
could easily be turnedinto a bedroom.

01:03:44.404 --> 01:03:46.114
We just add a doorand a closet.

01:03:46.114 --> 01:03:47.991
- We can't make any changeswithout consulting Miles.

01:03:47.991 --> 01:03:51.286
- It's our house, Drew.

01:03:51.286 --> 01:03:53.038
- You close that big holein the ceiling,

01:03:53.038 --> 01:03:55.624
you'll probably have roomfor a couple more bedrooms.

01:03:55.624 --> 01:03:56.917
- Yeah, but tiny.

01:03:56.917 --> 01:03:59.253
- No, that area is partof the staircase.

01:03:59.253 --> 01:04:01.088
It's--it'sthe main design feature.

01:04:01.088 --> 01:04:04.049
- Hmm. Looks likewasted space to me.

01:04:04.049 --> 01:04:06.510
- Well, you know, you couldmaybe squeeze in

01:04:06.510 --> 01:04:08.054
another bathroom here.

01:04:08.054 --> 01:04:11.014
Oh, and if you push outthe kitchen wall there,

01:04:11.014 --> 01:04:12.934
you know,you could have a little mudroom

01:04:12.934 --> 01:04:15.394
for when the childrencome in from playing.

01:04:15.394 --> 01:04:17.813
- Can't they just wipetheir little feet on the mat?

01:04:17.813 --> 01:04:22.276
- If we're gonna make changes,now is the time to do it.

01:04:22.276 --> 01:04:25.071
- Boy, you don't look so good.-

01:04:25.071 --> 01:04:27.030
I'm gonna be sick.

01:04:30.284 --> 01:04:32.619
- It's probablythe shellfish.

01:04:32.619 --> 01:04:34.621
We'll all be sick.

01:04:49.261 --> 01:04:50.887
- Uh-huh.

01:04:50.887 --> 01:04:52.889
Yeah, tax equity investment

01:04:52.889 --> 01:04:56.101
equal to present valuedistributions...

01:04:56.101 --> 01:05:00.022
discounted at a minimumunlevered target IRR.

01:05:00.022 --> 01:05:03.817
Yeah, based on the project'scapacity factor.

01:05:03.817 --> 01:05:06.820
Whether or not the partnershipflip structure yields returns.

01:05:06.820 --> 01:05:09.656
Right.The two lease structures--

01:05:09.656 --> 01:05:12.576
sale leasebackand inverted lease.

01:05:12.576 --> 01:05:13.995
Right.

01:05:20.375 --> 01:05:23.879
Feeling any better?- Not really.

01:05:23.879 --> 01:05:25.922
Sorry I couldn't saygood-bye to your parents.

01:05:25.922 --> 01:05:28.508
- They understood.If you're sick, you're sick.

01:05:28.508 --> 01:05:30.886
Not muchyou can do about it.

01:05:38.352 --> 01:05:40.896
Hmm.

01:05:46.943 --> 01:05:48.945
- What are you reading?

01:05:48.945 --> 01:05:51.948
- A very interesting analysisof whether a partnership flip

01:05:51.948 --> 01:05:55.535
yields higher returnsthan a sale leaseback.

01:05:55.535 --> 01:05:59.956
The conclusionis pretty surprising.

01:06:06.588 --> 01:06:08.882
- I'm pregnant.

01:06:10.884 --> 01:06:14.096
- Are you joking?

01:06:14.096 --> 01:06:17.140
Drew, honey.

01:06:41.082 --> 01:06:42.666
- Did you get my message?

01:06:42.666 --> 01:06:45.168
- Oh, yes.

01:06:45.168 --> 01:06:47.754
- And?- You can't change the walls

01:06:47.754 --> 01:06:49.840
without changing the structureand supports.

01:06:49.840 --> 01:06:51.508
I'd have to revise the plans.

01:06:51.508 --> 01:06:53.260
The structural engineerwould have to revise his plans.

01:06:53.260 --> 01:06:56.930
And Conway would issue achange-order for the extra cost.

01:06:56.930 --> 01:06:59.307
- Yeah, I know, but we needmore bedrooms.

01:06:59.307 --> 01:07:01.476
- Why?

01:07:01.476 --> 01:07:04.020
- A house this sizeshould have more bedrooms.

01:07:04.020 --> 01:07:05.439
It's just common sense.

01:07:05.439 --> 01:07:07.983
- Is common our goal?

01:07:07.983 --> 01:07:09.526
I don't know why peoplehire architects

01:07:09.526 --> 01:07:11.027
and then tell themwhat to do.

01:07:11.027 --> 01:07:12.946
- Because it's our house.

01:07:12.946 --> 01:07:14.573
- Well, often, the opinion

01:07:14.573 --> 01:07:17.076
of the client must bedisregarded for their own good.

01:07:17.076 --> 01:07:20.245
- Do--- We're having a baby.

01:07:20.245 --> 01:07:22.456
- What?

01:07:22.456 --> 01:07:24.250
Really?

01:07:24.250 --> 01:07:26.710
Congratulations!

01:07:26.710 --> 01:07:29.588
That's great news.- Thank you.

01:07:29.588 --> 01:07:32.215
- The space for the daybed

01:07:32.215 --> 01:07:34.718
can easily be modified

01:07:34.718 --> 01:07:38.221
to make room for the baby.

01:07:38.221 --> 01:07:40.098
- Oh, I'm glad you agree,

01:07:40.098 --> 01:07:42.184
'cause if we don't start makingsome practical compromises,

01:07:42.184 --> 01:07:44.019
we're gonna end upwith a white elephant.

01:07:44.019 --> 01:07:45.395
- Oh, really?

01:07:45.395 --> 01:07:47.273
Would "Art and Architecture"magazine

01:07:47.273 --> 01:07:49.232
put a white elephanton its cover?

01:07:49.232 --> 01:07:51.818
- "Art and Architecture"magazine?

01:07:51.818 --> 01:07:53.320
- A feature writercalled me yesterday.

01:07:53.320 --> 01:07:57.073
The Stone House is a finalistfor their October issue.

01:07:57.073 --> 01:07:59.075
- Wow.

01:07:59.075 --> 01:08:02.288
- That's pretty good.

01:08:20.221 --> 01:08:22.224
- Michael. Mike Stone.

01:08:22.224 --> 01:08:25.269
- No.

01:08:25.269 --> 01:08:27.729
What about Braydon?

01:08:27.729 --> 01:08:29.773
- Braydon?That sounds like a horse.

01:08:31.274 --> 01:08:36.071
- I like Joseph.Joseph. Joseph Stone.

01:08:36.071 --> 01:08:37.531
- Regular Joe.

01:08:37.531 --> 01:08:39.325
- Well...- Wow.

01:08:39.325 --> 01:08:42.077
What about Grayson?

01:08:42.077 --> 01:08:43.787
- You're just making stuff up.

01:08:43.787 --> 01:08:47.332
- Well...

01:08:47.332 --> 01:08:50.794
What about Uptonor Hudson...

01:08:50.794 --> 01:08:52.546
or Grace?

01:08:52.546 --> 01:08:55.799
- That sounds like a law firm--Upton, Hudson, and Grace.

01:08:55.799 --> 01:08:59.803
What happened to somethingsimple, like--like Jane?

01:08:59.803 --> 01:09:01.555
- - That's pretty. Jane.

01:09:01.555 --> 01:09:04.140
- Plain Janeand Average Joe.

01:09:04.140 --> 01:09:05.725
- No.- Wow.

01:09:05.725 --> 01:09:10.356
Wow.It's fantastic, Miles.

01:09:10.356 --> 01:09:11.273
- Incredible.

01:09:11.273 --> 01:09:13.359
Let me ask you,can you paint it?

01:09:13.359 --> 01:09:15.277
- The titanium?

01:09:15.277 --> 01:09:17.487
Why would you wantto do that?

01:09:17.487 --> 01:09:20.156
- I'm saying down the road,you know, for a change of pace.

01:09:20.156 --> 01:09:24.328
- That's insane.It's--it's beautiful.

01:09:24.328 --> 01:09:27.162
It has a 100-year warrantyagainst corrosion.

01:09:27.162 --> 01:09:29.791
- Well, it's just...

01:09:29.791 --> 01:09:32.544
more silver than I thoughtit would be.

01:09:32.544 --> 01:09:35.005
- I love it.

01:09:35.005 --> 01:09:36.339
- Gary.

01:09:36.339 --> 01:09:38.591
- Ew.

01:09:38.591 --> 01:09:40.135
Abigail.

01:09:40.135 --> 01:09:43.345
- Yeah, that rollsright off the tongue.

01:09:43.345 --> 01:09:46.140
- Oscar.- Oscar?

01:09:46.140 --> 01:09:49.395
Wow. Middle schoolwasn't hard enough.

01:09:49.395 --> 01:09:50.604
Jeff.

01:09:52.147 --> 01:09:55.150
Jeff is not a namefor an adult.

01:09:55.150 --> 01:09:57.152
- Jeffrey.

01:10:00.155 --> 01:10:01.740
- Imogen.

01:10:01.740 --> 01:10:03.617
- Do you want her to hate us?Is that what you want?

01:10:03.617 --> 01:10:05.869
I mean, really,if you want to show the world

01:10:05.869 --> 01:10:07.370
that you're creative,sweetheart,

01:10:07.370 --> 01:10:09.664
do it in a way that doesn't harminnocent bystanders.

01:10:09.664 --> 01:10:11.374
- Is that what you thinkI'm doing?

01:10:11.374 --> 01:10:14.919
- Kids want to fit in.They don't want to be different.

01:10:14.919 --> 01:10:17.672
- What if the childisn't as conservative

01:10:17.672 --> 01:10:21.217
and unimaginativeas the father?

01:10:21.217 --> 01:10:23.262
- Oh, yeah?W-w-what if he is?

01:10:23.262 --> 01:10:25.430
What if he's--what if he'sactually quite capable

01:10:25.430 --> 01:10:27.682
o-o-of dealing sensiblyand prudently

01:10:27.682 --> 01:10:29.310
with practical matters?

01:10:29.310 --> 01:10:30.685
I mean, have you seenthese change orders--

01:10:30.685 --> 01:10:32.937
these extras addedby your genius?

01:10:32.937 --> 01:10:34.439
The costskeep spiraling upward,

01:10:34.439 --> 01:10:36.691
just likethis fucking staircase.

01:10:36.691 --> 01:10:39.903
- Why do we always do thingsyour way?

01:10:39.903 --> 01:10:41.696
- We don't do thingsmy way, sweetheart.

01:10:41.696 --> 01:10:45.492
We do them the right way--with research and planning.

01:10:45.492 --> 01:10:47.994
- You claimthere's all this logic,

01:10:47.994 --> 01:10:50.497
but it alwaysends up your way.

01:10:50.497 --> 01:10:54.668
You argue with me until youwear me down and I give in.

01:10:54.668 --> 01:10:56.503
- You know what?You see things wrong.

01:10:56.503 --> 01:10:58.297
Sometimes I wish I could just--

01:10:58.297 --> 01:11:00.298
I could just reach insideyour head and flip a switch,

01:11:00.298 --> 01:11:02.300
you know, just changeyour perspective.

01:11:02.300 --> 01:11:05.011
But I guess, you know,we bring different things

01:11:05.011 --> 01:11:06.930
to the tableas life partners, right?

01:11:06.930 --> 01:11:10.433
I'm good at making money.You're good at spending it.

01:11:10.433 --> 01:11:11.935
I'm good at making calculated,

01:11:11.935 --> 01:11:14.229
informed decisionsthat yield positive results,

01:11:14.229 --> 01:11:15.980
and you're good at making quick,impulsive decisions

01:11:15.980 --> 01:11:18.983
and neverthinking twice, right?

01:11:24.280 --> 01:11:26.741
What, is it lunch?

01:11:29.411 --> 01:11:31.496
- There you go. Good girl.

01:11:31.496 --> 01:11:33.998
That's his preschoolmusic teacher at Montessori.

01:11:33.998 --> 01:11:37.001
Are you gonna get him?Go get him. Go get him.

01:11:37.001 --> 01:11:39.003
- Max has a naturalsense of rhythm.

01:11:39.003 --> 01:11:41.089
You should see himin ballet.

01:11:41.089 --> 01:11:42.340
- It used to turn me on

01:11:42.340 --> 01:11:44.300
when I'd hear him talkabout business.

01:11:44.300 --> 01:11:47.303
He was so confident.

01:11:47.303 --> 01:11:50.181
It was not confidence.He's just stubborn.

01:11:50.181 --> 01:11:52.600
- You're out of your mindto think of leaving Colin.

01:11:52.600 --> 01:11:54.853
How much difference does it makewho the guy is, anyway?

01:11:54.853 --> 01:11:58.523
Once you have a baby, the guybecomes so much less important.

01:12:00.484 --> 01:12:01.818
Do you really think

01:12:01.818 --> 01:12:04.070
that you want to beon your own right now?

01:12:06.072 --> 01:12:08.992
- How did the relationship workbetween architect and client?

01:12:08.992 --> 01:12:13.496
- Ah, truly inspired,a wonderful collaboration,

01:12:13.496 --> 01:12:16.499
great chemistrybetween architect and client.

01:12:16.499 --> 01:12:18.293
- Oh, good.

01:12:18.293 --> 01:12:20.754
- Your details are off.

01:12:20.754 --> 01:12:22.797
You obviously haveno field experience.

01:12:22.797 --> 01:12:26.342
Your--your construction drawingsare just pretty pictures.

01:12:26.342 --> 01:12:27.802
- You're not even usingthe latest set!

01:12:27.802 --> 01:12:29.345
These were revised!

01:12:29.345 --> 01:12:30.972
- You've changed themso many times,

01:12:30.972 --> 01:12:32.557
I don't even knowwhat I'm building anymore!

01:12:32.557 --> 01:12:34.350
This is completelyunprofessional.

01:12:34.350 --> 01:12:37.353
Let me tell you--I am not losingmoney on this job

01:12:37.353 --> 01:12:39.355
based on your incompetence.

01:12:39.355 --> 01:12:41.816
My advice to you is learnhow to work with real life!

01:12:41.816 --> 01:12:42.817
both: Ooh.

01:12:42.817 --> 01:12:44.402
It looks like the chemistry

01:12:44.402 --> 01:12:46.362
between architect and contractorisn't quite as good.

01:12:46.362 --> 01:12:48.573
- Constructionis very stressful,

01:12:48.573 --> 01:12:51.826
and we're usingsome very unusual materials

01:12:51.826 --> 01:12:54.537
for a residence--titanium, for example.

01:12:54.537 --> 01:12:56.873
- The floating staircaseis impressive.

01:12:56.873 --> 01:12:59.876
- It wasa true collaboration.

01:12:59.876 --> 01:13:01.628
I was his muse.

01:13:01.628 --> 01:13:05.423
- You were his muse?- Don't write that.

01:13:05.423 --> 01:13:07.801
- Society needs  a good image of itself.

01:13:07.801 --> 01:13:09.761
That's the job  of the architect.

01:13:09.761 --> 01:13:12.347
If a clientwants a house designed,

01:13:12.347 --> 01:13:14.516
most architectswill design one,

01:13:14.516 --> 01:13:16.059
but a conscientious architect

01:13:16.059 --> 01:13:18.561
will ask firstwhy this house is needed.

01:13:18.561 --> 01:13:21.356
What is its raison d'être?

01:13:21.356 --> 01:13:23.024
- Hmm.- The architect may conclude

01:13:23.024 --> 01:13:26.612
we don't need this houseand walk away.

01:13:26.612 --> 01:13:29.489
That's why I don't havea lot of clients.

01:13:29.489 --> 01:13:31.407
- There seemsto be conflict

01:13:31.407 --> 01:13:34.869
between youand the contractor.

01:13:34.869 --> 01:13:38.414
- To a man with a hammer,everything looks like a nail.

01:13:44.629 --> 01:13:47.048
- Yet another stack  of change orders.

01:13:47.048 --> 01:13:49.425
I don't pay these by tomorrow,Conway walks off the job.

01:13:49.425 --> 01:13:51.135
The cost isout of control, Miles.

01:13:51.135 --> 01:13:52.804
It's like you're just--

01:13:52.804 --> 01:13:54.640
you defy me and then buildwhatever the hell you want.

01:13:54.640 --> 01:13:57.433
- Cost is very simple.It is materials plus labor.

01:13:57.433 --> 01:14:00.144
You want a $5 million housefor a million dollars.

01:14:00.144 --> 01:14:02.438
How's that my fault?Want me to pay for it myself?

01:14:02.438 --> 01:14:04.190
- What are all the extras?- Essential details.

01:14:04.190 --> 01:14:05.525
- You said less is more.

01:14:05.525 --> 01:14:07.861
- Less is only morewhen more is no good.

01:14:09.571 --> 01:14:11.406
And these stairs--I've been thinking about them.

01:14:11.406 --> 01:14:13.659
They're just too dangerouswithout a handrail.

01:14:13.659 --> 01:14:14.909
- A handrail?

01:14:14.909 --> 01:14:17.496
Can you imaginehow ridiculous that would look?

01:14:17.496 --> 01:14:18.872
- I'm saying it's dangerous.

01:14:18.872 --> 01:14:20.666
I can't believethe Building Department

01:14:20.666 --> 01:14:22.417
would even allow it.- They won't.

01:14:22.417 --> 01:14:26.129
Creativity is stifled by anoverzealous concern for safety.

01:14:26.129 --> 01:14:28.131
We will put intemporary handrail

01:14:28.131 --> 01:14:29.716
and remove itafter inspection.

01:14:29.716 --> 01:14:31.134
- Isn't that illegal?

01:14:31.134 --> 01:14:32.927
- It's your house,not the city's.

01:14:32.927 --> 01:14:36.431
- Do you see what I meanabout all this wasted space?

01:14:36.431 --> 01:14:40.935
- Wasted space?There is a purpose to beauty.

01:14:40.935 --> 01:14:42.478
- If we fill this in,we add two rooms.

01:14:42.478 --> 01:14:44.689
- Fill it in?You don't need two more rooms.

01:14:44.689 --> 01:14:46.190
- Don't tell me--

01:14:46.190 --> 01:14:48.484
How can you beso incredibly arrogant?

01:14:48.484 --> 01:14:51.487
- If I have to choosebetween honest arrogance

01:14:51.487 --> 01:14:54.949
and hypocritical humility,I choose honesty.

01:14:54.949 --> 01:14:56.701
There's no reasonto change it.

01:14:56.701 --> 01:14:58.494
- What are you--Oh.

01:14:58.494 --> 01:15:00.705
You think--you think you canprove anything by drawing it.

01:15:00.705 --> 01:15:02.206
- I prefer drawingto talking.

01:15:02.206 --> 01:15:03.499
It's faster,and there are no lies.

01:15:03.499 --> 01:15:05.126
Is this what you want--

01:15:05.126 --> 01:15:06.878
bisect this spaceand create two rectangles?

01:15:06.878 --> 01:15:08.672
- Yes.What's wrong with that?

01:15:08.672 --> 01:15:10.716
- For you,maybe nothing, Colon.

01:15:10.716 --> 01:15:12.342
You're a rectangular man.

01:15:12.342 --> 01:15:15.470
But for Drew, who is fluidand curvaceous,

01:15:15.470 --> 01:15:17.680
whose spiritis spontaneous and free,

01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:19.641
she can't livein those rooms.

01:15:19.641 --> 01:15:21.476
- Do not talkabout my wife like that.

01:15:21.476 --> 01:15:22.560
You are crossinga line there.

01:15:22.560 --> 01:15:23.895
- Again, there is a line--

01:15:23.895 --> 01:15:25.939
a straight line,a line in the sand,

01:15:25.939 --> 01:15:27.398
a line thatcan't be crossed!

01:15:27.398 --> 01:15:28.900
- All right, you know what?You know what?

01:15:28.900 --> 01:15:31.194
I'm not paying another dime.That includes your bill.

01:15:31.194 --> 01:15:32.946
- Then I'll file a lienon your property.

01:15:32.946 --> 01:15:34.405
- Really?So I should get a lawyer?

01:15:34.405 --> 01:15:35.949
Is that where this is headed?

01:15:35.949 --> 01:15:37.700
- Where there's a will,there's a lawsuit.

01:15:37.700 --> 01:15:39.202
Ignorance of the law

01:15:39.202 --> 01:15:40.954
never stopped anyonefrom practicing it.

01:15:40.954 --> 01:15:42.997
You wouldn't nickel-and-dimea surgeon, would you?

01:15:42.997 --> 01:15:44.540
You respect his knowledge.

01:15:44.540 --> 01:15:46.585
You understandthe need for his services.

01:15:46.585 --> 01:15:49.003
When I figure the amount of timeI spend on a project,

01:15:49.003 --> 01:15:51.005
it works outto about $15 an hour.

01:15:51.005 --> 01:15:52.966
I feel likea poor seamstress.

01:15:52.966 --> 01:15:54.593
Do you want to knowthe real reason

01:15:54.593 --> 01:15:56.594
I didn't puta handrail in, huh?

01:15:58.388 --> 01:16:02.558
- It makes it very difficultto catch yourself if you fall.

01:16:31.045 --> 01:16:32.630
- Don't you thinkyou're overreacting?

01:16:32.630 --> 01:16:34.716
I mean, God, your hormonesare all over the place.

01:16:34.716 --> 01:16:37.260
- My hormones?It can't possibly be you.

01:16:37.260 --> 01:16:40.263
- I had to fire him.He threatened me physically.

01:16:40.263 --> 01:16:42.056
- Miles Moss?

01:16:42.056 --> 01:16:43.809
- Where are you--where are you going?

01:16:43.809 --> 01:16:44.934
You're eight monthspregnant.

01:16:44.934 --> 01:16:47.562
You are the leastpractical woman I know.

01:16:47.562 --> 01:16:49.773
- I need to be alone.

01:16:49.773 --> 01:16:51.607
- Why do you never rememberthe good times?

01:16:51.607 --> 01:16:53.609
We never--

01:16:53.609 --> 01:16:56.612
We're having a stressful time,but we have good times, Drew.

01:16:56.612 --> 01:16:58.657
Last year, in Mexico--

01:16:58.657 --> 01:17:00.491
Remember, we walkedinto the hotel lobby,

01:17:00.491 --> 01:17:02.869
and the mariachi bandwas playing our song?

01:17:02.869 --> 01:17:05.621
- Our song?What song is that?

01:17:05.621 --> 01:17:08.624
- How can you not knowwe have a song?

01:17:08.624 --> 01:17:11.753
- I feel like we'rein two different marriages.

01:17:11.753 --> 01:17:14.798
What songare you talking about?

01:17:14.798 --> 01:17:18.718
- "My Heart Will Go On"...

01:17:18.718 --> 01:17:21.680
from the "Titanic" movie.

01:17:21.680 --> 01:17:24.683
- This is whywe can't be together.

01:17:24.683 --> 01:17:27.811
- Drew, don't do this.

01:17:27.811 --> 01:17:29.020
Don't do this.

01:17:29.020 --> 01:17:30.813
Look, a marriagecannot always be exciting

01:17:30.813 --> 01:17:32.315
and inspiring, you know.

01:17:32.315 --> 01:17:34.067
You settle in,and you get comfortable.

01:17:34.067 --> 01:17:35.736
That's normal.

01:17:35.736 --> 01:17:37.111
I'm a good guy.

01:17:37.111 --> 01:17:38.864
I'm doing everythingI'm supposed to do.

01:17:38.864 --> 01:17:40.323
I'm stable, emotionallyand financially,

01:17:40.323 --> 01:17:41.491
more than you know.

01:17:41.491 --> 01:17:43.869
There is nothingwrong with us.

01:17:43.869 --> 01:17:45.912
Why do you invent problemswhere none exist?

01:17:45.912 --> 01:17:47.497
- I'm suffocating.

01:17:47.497 --> 01:17:49.332
If you find yourselftrapped in a box with no air,

01:17:49.332 --> 01:17:50.876
you don't ask permission.

01:17:50.876 --> 01:17:53.461
You just cut a holeso you can breathe.

01:17:53.461 --> 01:17:57.673
- I don't understand that.- No, you don't. You don't.

01:17:57.673 --> 01:17:59.383
- Drew, don't--

01:17:59.383 --> 01:18:00.676
Come here, please.

01:18:00.676 --> 01:18:02.595
Come here.

01:18:02.595 --> 01:18:05.849
Don't do this.

01:18:05.849 --> 01:18:08.852
We'll finish the house, okay?

01:18:08.852 --> 01:18:10.854
We'll finishthe house your way,

01:18:10.854 --> 01:18:12.814
but then, please...

01:18:12.814 --> 01:18:15.983
let's get this nut caseout of our lives.

01:19:00.695 --> 01:19:03.698
- Drew?

01:19:03.698 --> 01:19:05.658
Drew?

01:20:48.887 --> 01:20:50.096
- So cute.

01:20:50.096 --> 01:20:51.889
Our philosophy is that children

01:20:51.889 --> 01:20:54.809
should love comingand love learning.

01:20:54.809 --> 01:20:56.895
If they don't jump outof the car and run right in,

01:20:56.895 --> 01:20:58.604
we want to know about it.

01:20:58.604 --> 01:21:00.731
Now let me show youthe children's cubbies.

01:21:06.487 --> 01:21:08.823
- Putnam Hatch.- Yes.

01:21:08.823 --> 01:21:10.992
- I was in your house.

01:21:10.992 --> 01:21:12.326
- You were in my house?

01:21:12.326 --> 01:21:14.955
- The Hatch Houseon Fulton Road.

01:21:14.955 --> 01:21:17.707
- What were you doingin my house?

01:21:17.707 --> 01:21:19.750
- Miles Moss showed me around.

01:21:19.750 --> 01:21:22.044
- Who is Miles Moss?

01:21:22.044 --> 01:21:24.923
- The architectwho designed your house?

01:21:24.923 --> 01:21:28.009
- The architect who designedmy house was Leo Sullivan.

01:21:28.009 --> 01:21:31.595
- Yeah, that's right--Sullivan and Moss.

01:21:31.595 --> 01:21:33.055
- No, that's not right.

01:21:33.055 --> 01:21:36.058
That was James Moss,Sullivan's business partner.

01:21:36.058 --> 01:21:37.893
Look, I don't knowwho your friend is,

01:21:37.893 --> 01:21:39.895
and I don't knowhow he got access to my house,

01:21:39.895 --> 01:21:41.897
but if either of youcomes back,

01:21:41.897 --> 01:21:43.566
I'm gonna haveyou arrested.

01:22:18.100 --> 01:22:21.354
- Hi.

01:22:21.354 --> 01:22:24.148
- Who designedthe Hatch House?

01:22:24.148 --> 01:22:25.816
- What?

01:22:25.816 --> 01:22:28.819
- Why doesn't Putnam Hatchknow you?

01:22:28.819 --> 01:22:30.404
- W-what are youtalking about?

01:22:30.404 --> 01:22:31.947
- I just met him.

01:22:31.947 --> 01:22:34.658
He doesn't know you.

01:22:34.658 --> 01:22:37.161
- That's not true.

01:22:37.161 --> 01:22:39.330
Why do you have the keysto his house?

01:22:40.956 --> 01:22:44.168
- Why are you asking meall of these questions?

01:22:44.168 --> 01:22:46.046
- I don't knowwho you are.

01:22:46.046 --> 01:22:48.589
I don't knowwhat's going on.

01:22:49.965 --> 01:22:53.386
Did you or did you notdesign that house?

01:22:55.971 --> 01:22:57.932
- We all workedon it together.

01:22:57.932 --> 01:23:00.060
- Who's "we"?

01:23:00.060 --> 01:23:03.521
- Sullivan,my father, and me.

01:23:09.402 --> 01:23:12.197
Come on, come sit down.Sit down, sit down.

01:23:20.579 --> 01:23:23.416
- I left Colin.

01:23:32.092 --> 01:23:33.717
- That's great news!

01:23:33.717 --> 01:23:35.845
We don't need himanymore!

01:23:35.845 --> 01:23:37.721
- What?

01:23:37.721 --> 01:23:39.098
- The houseis almost finished.

01:23:39.098 --> 01:23:41.016
The--the bank will make sureit's completed

01:23:41.016 --> 01:23:43.519
even if Colin stops paying.

01:23:43.519 --> 01:23:47.022
- I thought you'd bea little more sympathetic

01:23:47.022 --> 01:23:50.025
and a little less ambitious.

01:23:50.025 --> 01:23:51.735
- I'm sorry.You're right. I'm...

01:23:51.735 --> 01:23:56.240
Being totally selfish.

01:23:56.240 --> 01:24:01.036
You're contemplating makinga big life change, and...

01:24:01.036 --> 01:24:04.790
I'm worryingabout finishing the house.

01:24:07.252 --> 01:24:11.005
It's just thatthe magazine people

01:24:11.005 --> 01:24:15.384
are coming to take photosand finish the story.

01:24:15.384 --> 01:24:19.680
We made the coverof "Art and Architecture."

01:24:21.807 --> 01:24:24.226
You can build a careerout of that.

01:24:24.226 --> 01:24:28.189
- I thoughtyou had a career.

01:24:31.025 --> 01:24:33.402
- It could be better.

01:24:42.536 --> 01:24:46.332
- This is your first house,isn't it?

01:24:46.332 --> 01:24:50.669
- We make a great team, Drew.

01:24:50.669 --> 01:24:54.089
Maybe we could livehere together...

01:24:54.089 --> 01:24:57.218
you, me and the baby.

01:25:05.559 --> 01:25:07.520
- Oh, no. You don't--Don't--don't look at that.

01:25:07.520 --> 01:25:08.938
Don't look at that.Don't--

01:25:08.938 --> 01:25:10.606
It's not--

01:25:22.284 --> 01:25:26.789
"Best graduate design projectof 2002."

01:25:28.791 --> 01:25:30.292
Oh.- Drew, I'm sorry.

01:25:30.292 --> 01:25:32.295
I had to getthe house built.

01:25:32.295 --> 01:25:33.379
It's a good design, Drew.

01:25:33.379 --> 01:25:35.215
Please.

01:25:35.215 --> 01:25:38.175
I've had a long timeto think about it.

01:26:04.618 --> 01:26:06.287
- Drew?

01:26:10.583 --> 01:26:12.167
Drew?

01:26:12.167 --> 01:26:13.502
Oh, no.

01:26:19.217 --> 01:26:22.428
Drew!

01:26:22.428 --> 01:26:24.179
Please.

01:26:24.179 --> 01:26:26.557
Drew, forgive me.- Aah!

01:26:26.557 --> 01:26:29.184
- I could never get anyof my projects built.

01:26:29.184 --> 01:26:30.853
I spent countless years

01:26:30.853 --> 01:26:34.773
designing handicap-accessiblebathrooms...

01:26:37.735 --> 01:26:41.239
Drew, I never met the rightclient until I met you.

01:26:41.239 --> 01:26:44.074
You're the one.We had the same inspiration!

01:26:44.074 --> 01:26:46.577
It's possible!Drew, please!

01:26:46.577 --> 01:26:48.245
Drew!

01:26:58.881 --> 01:27:00.841
Aah!

01:28:57.750 --> 01:28:58.751
- Oh.

01:28:58.751 --> 01:29:00.586
Oh.

01:29:06.509 --> 01:29:08.552
Ugh.

01:29:08.552 --> 01:29:13.265
She painted the titanium.

01:29:13.265 --> 01:29:15.476
- That's gonnavoid the warranty.

01:29:41.043 --> 01:29:43.796
- The color's calledGrandma's refrigerator.

01:29:43.796 --> 01:29:46.340
It's on the chart I submitted.

01:29:46.340 --> 01:29:47.800
It's all planned out.

01:29:47.800 --> 01:29:50.344
I-I-I can't makean impulsive decision

01:29:50.344 --> 01:29:51.595
while climbing a ladder.

01:29:51.595 --> 01:29:55.600
Hold on.Where's the color chart?

01:29:55.600 --> 01:29:57.559
I have the chart right here--

01:29:57.559 --> 01:30:01.814
Dill pickle, dead salmon,dog's ear, baby's bottom,

01:30:01.814 --> 01:30:04.066
Grandma's refrigerator.

01:30:04.066 --> 01:30:05.443
He's not sure about the yellow.

01:30:05.443 --> 01:30:06.777
He's confused

01:30:06.777 --> 01:30:08.613
because his grandma'srefrigerator was white.

01:30:08.613 --> 01:30:09.571
Can you talk to him?

01:30:09.571 --> 01:30:10.823
- Frank?- Yeah.

01:30:10.823 --> 01:30:13.408
- Take Imogen.- Imogen.

01:30:13.408 --> 01:30:15.911
- Hey, Frank.Hi. It's Colin.

01:30:15.911 --> 01:30:17.621
Yeah, I know.

01:30:17.621 --> 01:30:19.414
I know. My grandmother'srefrigerator was green.

01:30:19.414 --> 01:30:21.124
It's just the name the companygave the paint color.

01:30:21.124 --> 01:30:23.126
It doesn't mean anything.

01:30:23.126 --> 01:30:24.837
No. Look, she startedanother job.

01:30:24.837 --> 01:30:27.923
She's bookedfor the rest of the year.

01:30:27.923 --> 01:30:30.133
Let me explain something.

01:30:30.133 --> 01:30:32.886
Drew's an artist.She's not a painting contractor.

01:30:32.886 --> 01:30:34.429
You don't get to choosethe color.

01:30:34.429 --> 01:30:36.640
It's not repairand maintenance.

01:30:36.640 --> 01:30:38.433
Well, she's not tryingto please everyone.

01:30:38.433 --> 01:30:40.143
She's trying to move them,you know,

01:30:40.143 --> 01:30:42.145
draw themout of their comfort zone,

01:30:42.145 --> 01:30:43.939
make them think and feel.

01:30:43.939 --> 01:30:46.692
Her work isvery mysterious Frank.

01:30:46.692 --> 01:30:49.194
It's compellingand surprising.

01:30:49.194 --> 01:30:50.946
Just sit with it for a while.

01:30:50.946 --> 01:30:52.865
Let Drew do her thing,

01:30:52.865 --> 01:30:55.951
and I'm sure that you'll bevery happy in the end, okay?

01:30:55.951 --> 01:30:57.495
Okay. Bye.

01:30:57.495 --> 01:30:59.204
- Thank you.

01:30:59.204 --> 01:31:01.957
- Here, take that.I got to take her for a nap.

01:31:01.957 --> 01:31:04.209
- Yes.- Hmm?

01:31:04.209 --> 01:31:06.128
Come here.Come here.

01:31:08.714 --> 01:31:12.677
A littleGrandma's refrigerator there.

01:31:14.887 --> 01:31:16.889
All right, you, here we go.

01:31:16.889 --> 01:31:19.725
Whee!Oh, boy.

01:31:19.725 --> 01:31:22.185
- Bye!- Oh, boy.
