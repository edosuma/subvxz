00:03.740 --> 00:06.270
So, since your mom used
to handle the holidays,

00:06.280 --> 00:08.170
I thought we should
talk about a game plan

00:08.180 --> 00:10.339
for Thanksgiving and Christmas.

00:10.340 --> 00:12.680
Oh, I say we follow the
Conner tradition...

00:12.700 --> 00:14.176
spend every dime we have on Halloween,

00:14.200 --> 00:15.780
and then we have nothing
to be thankful for

00:15.800 --> 00:16.850
or buy gifts with.

00:19.260 --> 00:20.500
Hi, Mom. Hi, Aunt Jackie.

00:20.520 --> 00:22.340
- Hi.
- Hey. How was school?

00:22.360 --> 00:24.520
Good. We're learning about democracy.

00:24.560 --> 00:27.060
Oh, it's a class in ancient history, eh?

00:28.480 --> 00:30.530
We're doing projects about the election.

00:30.540 --> 00:31.820
I'm gonna take a poll at the mall

00:31.840 --> 00:33.140
to see how people voted.

00:33.180 --> 00:34.680
Oh, good, my 11-year-old

00:34.710 --> 00:36.160
approaching strangers at the mall.

00:36.170 --> 00:37.170
Why don't we double down and just

00:37.180 --> 00:38.840
have you hitchhike there?

00:39.880 --> 00:41.740
No, you're taking me.

00:41.750 --> 00:43.100
Oh, I-I-I can't.

00:43.120 --> 00:44.130
I have to work that day.

00:44.140 --> 00:45.780
I didn't tell you what day it was.

00:46.690 --> 00:48.420
Oh, you didn't?

00:48.480 --> 00:49.719
Well, let's not get bogged down

00:49.720 --> 00:50.850
in he said, she said.

00:52.090 --> 00:53.450
All right, what day is it?

00:53.460 --> 00:54.890
- Saturday.
- How about that?

00:54.920 --> 00:56.150
I actually have to work that day.

00:56.160 --> 00:59.300
Well, I'm free on Saturday.
I'd love to help.

00:59.320 --> 01:01.170
I think it's great that
you're hungry to learn

01:01.220 --> 01:03.180
about how democracy is supposed to work,

01:03.200 --> 01:04.860
'cause it's up to you young people

01:04.870 --> 01:07.100
to snatch it back from special interests

01:07.110 --> 01:10.330
and breathe new life into
this noble experiment

01:10.360 --> 01:12.440
that we call America.

01:13.480 --> 01:16.400
Guys, you got to see this.

01:18.000 --> 01:24.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:29.040 --> 01:30.520
Why is he outside?

01:30.760 --> 01:32.100
He's watching TV.

01:34.200 --> 01:37.030
Well, yes, that's the
obvious explanation.

01:37.040 --> 01:39.400
Now let's dig a little deeper.

01:39.500 --> 01:41.700
I think the shock of losing your mom

01:41.710 --> 01:43.330
has worn off and now
he's just depressed,

01:43.360 --> 01:44.920
but he doesn't want us to see it.

01:44.940 --> 01:46.710
Well, watching TV from the porch

01:46.750 --> 01:48.200
is not a good way to hide it.

01:49.540 --> 01:51.299
He's been isolating himself

01:51.300 --> 01:52.949
from the family more and more.

01:52.950 --> 01:54.920
Before you know it, he'll
be across the street.

01:56.840 --> 01:59.200
Oh, he'll go as far as
that remote will let him.

02:04.460 --> 02:06.700
Hey, Dad.

02:07.070 --> 02:09.060
What's up?

02:13.340 --> 02:15.900
Watching TV from the porch.

02:15.910 --> 02:18.370
Cool.

02:18.380 --> 02:20.740
Quick question. Why?

02:20.750 --> 02:23.299
I wanted to watch TV,

02:23.300 --> 02:25.840
and I'm getting some fresh air.

02:25.980 --> 02:28.720
Also looking for a little alone time.

02:28.750 --> 02:29.760
Don't mind us.

02:29.770 --> 02:32.050
- Yeah, sure.
- Yeah, that's healthy.

02:32.060 --> 02:33.320
Yeah.

02:35.640 --> 02:38.160
I'm glad you feel that way.

02:39.360 --> 02:41.540
But we won't know until we test it.

02:55.260 --> 02:58.110
Okay, if you're gonna track
me like a wounded animal,

02:58.120 --> 03:00.680
do the decent thing and
shoot me, would you?

03:01.250 --> 03:03.850
Dan, you can't avoid our love.

03:03.860 --> 03:05.280
You've been through a huge loss.

03:05.290 --> 03:06.410
Tell us what you're feeling.

03:06.420 --> 03:07.590
Give it to us.

03:10.140 --> 03:11.490
All right.

03:11.500 --> 03:14.000
I am having a very strong feeling.

03:14.580 --> 03:16.579
My sister-in-law is badgering me,

03:16.580 --> 03:18.720
and I want her to leave my garage.

03:20.480 --> 03:22.320
Maybe you don't want to talk to us,

03:22.360 --> 03:24.400
but you got to talk to somebody.

03:24.440 --> 03:26.860
I went to a support
group when Mark died.

03:27.240 --> 03:28.800
It really helped me.

03:28.860 --> 03:30.350
I still go sometimes.

03:30.380 --> 03:32.270
There you go. Tell him
what you got out of it.

03:32.280 --> 03:34.199
Well, I talked to nice, old men

03:34.200 --> 03:35.789
who have tennis bracelets,

03:35.790 --> 03:37.120
but no one to wear them.

03:39.120 --> 03:40.560
See?

03:40.700 --> 03:42.800
It says "Tiffany,"

03:43.260 --> 03:45.300
but that's just the wife's name.

03:46.560 --> 03:49.090
I find that the guys
on my crew get jealous

03:49.100 --> 03:51.430
when I wear my diamonds, so that's out.

03:53.520 --> 03:55.330
I'll call you if I need you.

03:55.340 --> 03:57.240
Uh, you left your phone by the bike.

03:57.320 --> 03:58.580
Exactly.

04:36.280 --> 04:37.850
"The Conners" is recorded

04:37.860 --> 04:39.480
in front of a live studio audience.

04:39.520 --> 04:42.080
Okay, ladies, now that I'm back,

04:42.100 --> 04:44.950
I want to show you all how
Mary's hair should be done.

04:46.980 --> 04:49.110
It's a simple 10-step process

04:49.130 --> 04:51.690
that should take no
longer than three hours.

04:53.500 --> 04:55.980
Uh, looking at my hair,
did you ever think

04:56.000 --> 04:59.060
I had a realistic chance
of getting hers right?

04:59.580 --> 05:02.230
Okay, the car's all packed
up to head back to the base.

05:02.240 --> 05:03.890
Oh, remember we have to stop by the PX

05:03.910 --> 05:05.400
to get Mary some new church clothes.

05:05.460 --> 05:07.120
We don't go to church.

05:07.680 --> 05:09.540
Excuse me?

05:10.820 --> 05:12.270
What does she mean by that?

05:12.280 --> 05:14.440
Who knows? Kids have rich fantasy lives.

05:14.490 --> 05:16.640
They have dragons for friends.

05:18.100 --> 05:20.200
When was the last time
she was in church?

05:20.920 --> 05:23.740
It's funny, the tricks
time can play on you.

05:23.760 --> 05:25.380
How long?

05:25.400 --> 05:27.060
I'm gonna say about a year.

05:28.380 --> 05:30.360
How long?

05:30.380 --> 05:32.200
Two years.

05:32.300 --> 05:33.670
Two years?

05:33.680 --> 05:35.460
That's almost the whole time I was gone.

05:35.540 --> 05:37.050
Well, in D.J.'s defense,

05:37.080 --> 05:39.080
you know we've never really
been religious people.

05:39.200 --> 05:41.300
I mean, we pray, but it's usually just,

05:41.310 --> 05:43.510
"Rub-a-dub-dub, thanks
for the grub," or...

05:45.000 --> 05:48.020
... you know, asking for a
little help at the track.

05:49.840 --> 05:51.740
Well, some of us go regularly.

05:51.750 --> 05:53.850
I take my mother to
services every Sunday

05:53.890 --> 05:55.580
just to remind God she's still here

05:55.590 --> 05:57.660
in case he forgot to take her.

05:58.480 --> 06:00.830
Well, you can gamble with
your souls if you want,

06:00.850 --> 06:02.560
but my family's going to church.

06:02.620 --> 06:04.790
Aunt Darlene doesn't
make Mark and Harris go,

06:04.800 --> 06:06.280
so why do I have to?

06:06.300 --> 06:07.940
Because I said so.

06:09.480 --> 06:10.970
D.J., let's go.

06:14.340 --> 06:16.480
It's okay. I've had a good life.

06:19.920 --> 06:21.580
Yeah, I didn't want to correct him.

06:24.820 --> 06:27.450
Hey, so, my dad will be here any minute.

06:27.460 --> 06:30.050
And remember, he's
kind of raw right now,

06:30.060 --> 06:31.770
but I do think he really wants to talk.

06:31.780 --> 06:32.780
Just don't force it.

06:32.790 --> 06:35.520
We don't have to yell "Surprise," do we?

06:35.530 --> 06:37.239
No. No. Just hang out,

06:37.240 --> 06:38.540
have fun, don't make it weird.

06:39.380 --> 06:41.020
You know, if this doesn't work,

06:41.060 --> 06:44.200
I know some guys who
play drums in the woods.

06:44.210 --> 06:46.640
They seem pretty happy.

06:46.740 --> 06:49.000
Yeah, let's try beer and poker tonight,

06:49.010 --> 06:50.680
but we got that in our back pocket.

06:51.840 --> 06:53.320
- Right on.
- Right on.

06:55.100 --> 06:56.180
He's here.

06:56.220 --> 06:57.900
Everybody act casual.

07:01.760 --> 07:03.240
Jackie.

07:03.860 --> 07:05.999
Why is your car blocking the driveway?

07:06.000 --> 07:07.400
No reason.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.630
Maybe we just wanted you to come in

07:11.640 --> 07:13.970
- through the front door.
- For no reason!

07:14.140 --> 07:15.460
Oh, good.

07:15.470 --> 07:16.940
Crazy people.

07:18.620 --> 07:20.580
I know I'm in the right house.

07:21.780 --> 07:23.350
- Hey!
- Hey!

07:23.380 --> 07:24.750
- There he is!
- Come on in.

07:24.770 --> 07:26.160
What are you guys doing here?

07:26.200 --> 07:27.439
We're here to play some poker.

07:27.440 --> 07:29.520
Yeah. Dwight here, he
finally got his check

07:29.550 --> 07:31.450
from when that street
cleaner ran him over.

07:31.460 --> 07:32.700
We're gonna take his money.

07:34.780 --> 07:36.320
It was a rough night.

07:36.360 --> 07:37.990
Kind of fell asleep in the gutter.

07:40.460 --> 07:42.760
That is some real guy talk!

07:43.180 --> 07:45.760
Okay, Dan, you guys have a great game.

07:45.770 --> 07:47.880
There's no game. Everybody go home.

07:48.220 --> 07:49.480
Come on, we're all here.

07:49.500 --> 07:50.620
I said, "Go home."

07:53.320 --> 07:55.180
Oh. Hang on a minute.

07:55.220 --> 07:56.950
Let me just go talk to him.

07:57.720 --> 07:59.020
I thought I made it clear.

07:59.030 --> 08:00.580
I wanted to be left alone.

08:00.590 --> 08:02.240
But, Dad, these are your friends.

08:02.250 --> 08:03.919
We thought you could
just play some cards,

08:03.920 --> 08:05.510
maybe talk about some things.

08:05.520 --> 08:07.640
I already told you, I don't
have anything to talk about,

08:07.660 --> 08:09.380
and I don't need my friends
sitting around here

08:09.390 --> 08:10.660
feeling sorry for me.

08:10.760 --> 08:12.300
It's not like that.

08:12.520 --> 08:14.740
Your daughter, she's
just worried about you.

08:14.820 --> 08:16.090
We know what you're going through.

08:16.100 --> 08:17.160
Oh, I'm sorry, Chuck.

08:17.170 --> 08:19.360
I didn't realize Anne-Marie was dead.

08:20.310 --> 08:21.500
Oh, come on, Dan...

08:21.510 --> 08:24.370
Why doesn't everybody just
leave me the hell alone?!

08:27.110 --> 08:28.740
Dan gonna be okay?

08:29.310 --> 08:31.480
Think so.

08:31.580 --> 08:34.419
Um, sorry I dragged you
guys all the way over here.

08:34.419 --> 08:35.809
Ah, it's okay.

08:35.820 --> 08:38.860
We already lied to our wives
to get the night out.

08:40.620 --> 08:42.679
We're gonna hit the strip club.

08:45.100 --> 08:47.679
You're welcome to join
us if you want to.

08:47.680 --> 08:50.160
That's sweet. I'll pass.

08:50.220 --> 08:53.540
I'm getting my jacket!

08:57.100 --> 08:59.060
Now, you remember how,
back at the house,

08:59.110 --> 09:01.150
everybody was arguing about religion.

09:01.170 --> 09:03.170
Well, the same thing
happens with politics

09:03.180 --> 09:05.300
because it's very personal,
it's very private.

09:05.310 --> 09:06.679
So, as a pollster,

09:06.680 --> 09:09.420
your job is just remain neutral

09:09.460 --> 09:12.440
and just... you know,
just record the answers.

09:12.450 --> 09:14.080
Okay? Democracy in action.

09:14.090 --> 09:15.120
Go get 'em.

09:16.200 --> 09:18.780
Hello! I'm doing a
political poll for school.

09:18.820 --> 09:21.240
Are you voting Democrat or Republican?

09:21.280 --> 09:23.760
- Democrat.
- Blue wave! 2020!

09:25.200 --> 09:27.540
Sorry!

09:27.580 --> 09:29.390
Aunt Jackie, you scared her.

09:29.400 --> 09:31.110
Yeah, sorry. I just felt a rush of hope,

09:31.140 --> 09:32.520
and it just got away from me.

09:32.540 --> 09:33.570
Carry on.

09:34.700 --> 09:37.460
Hi, I'm doing a political
poll for school.

09:37.520 --> 09:39.820
Are you registered as a
Democrat or Republican?

09:39.840 --> 09:41.340
Republican.

09:41.350 --> 09:43.410
Did you vote for higher property taxes

09:43.420 --> 09:44.959
to pay for funding of the arts?

09:44.960 --> 09:46.200
No.

09:46.220 --> 09:47.450
Uh, hi.

09:47.550 --> 09:49.750
I'm Jackie, I'm the
aunt of the pollster.

09:49.760 --> 09:51.520
Quick follow-up question.

09:51.620 --> 09:53.580
So, there's proof that

09:53.590 --> 09:56.470
communities with more arts programs

09:56.500 --> 09:57.950
have less crime,

09:57.960 --> 09:59.860
and it enriches our kids' lives,

09:59.880 --> 10:01.790
and you like kids, right?

10:01.840 --> 10:03.830
Nice bait, but I'm not taking it.

10:03.850 --> 10:05.900
I work hard to pay my property taxes,

10:05.960 --> 10:07.360
and there are a lot
more important things

10:07.370 --> 10:08.389
to spend money on

10:08.390 --> 10:10.000
than the city wasting my taxes

10:10.010 --> 10:12.220
on a giant mural of a crying polar bear

10:12.240 --> 10:13.610
underneath a beach umbrella.

10:15.380 --> 10:17.780
He's not crying, he's sweating.

10:19.890 --> 10:22.000
So, you've never wasted money,

10:22.020 --> 10:25.100
you and that ridiculously huge pretzel.

10:25.160 --> 10:26.739
You want to talk about wasting money?

10:26.740 --> 10:27.799
How about Obamacare?

10:27.800 --> 10:28.810
How about the wall?

10:28.820 --> 10:30.379
- Benghazi.
- Collusion.

10:30.380 --> 10:32.240
- Fake news.
- Fake news!

10:34.380 --> 10:36.700
Thank you!

10:36.770 --> 10:39.230
Aunt Jackie, we're not
supposed to take sides.

10:39.240 --> 10:40.360
You're messing up the poll.

10:40.370 --> 10:42.510
I know. I get it.

10:45.820 --> 10:48.510
Ohh, here we go!

10:52.120 --> 10:53.820
Oh, I figured you'd show up.

10:53.950 --> 10:55.960
I'll make up the couch for you.

10:56.080 --> 10:57.340
I just need some help.

10:57.540 --> 10:59.020
Oh, sure.

10:59.030 --> 11:01.110
Right after I get Dad
out of his depression,

11:01.130 --> 11:02.130
do the laundry,

11:02.140 --> 11:04.199
make an ice-age diorama of Illinois

11:04.200 --> 11:05.220
for Mark's class.

11:05.230 --> 11:06.560
Maybe while I'm helping everybody,

11:06.570 --> 11:08.770
I can strap a broom to my
ass and sweep the kitchen.

11:09.900 --> 11:11.760
I can put these socks in a ball for you.

11:11.900 --> 11:13.019
Oh, thanks. That was the thing

11:13.020 --> 11:15.020
I was most concerned about.

11:15.820 --> 11:17.380
All right, what's up?

11:17.520 --> 11:19.240
I need you and Dad to go to church,

11:19.250 --> 11:20.850
and I need you to bring Mark and Harris.

11:20.880 --> 11:21.999
What? Why?

11:22.000 --> 11:23.380
So that Mary will want to go.

11:24.380 --> 11:25.810
I'm sorry, Deej. You know, it's like,

11:25.820 --> 11:27.550
the whole organized religion thing,

11:27.560 --> 11:29.330
it's up to you if you want
to believe there's a God,

11:29.340 --> 11:31.120
but I can't turn my back on my atheism.

11:31.140 --> 11:33.100
It's the only thing I believe in.

11:33.120 --> 11:35.790
Mary and Geena used to love
to go to church together.

11:35.820 --> 11:37.460
This was huge for them.

11:37.480 --> 11:38.780
And I wrecked it.

11:38.820 --> 11:40.400
Well, then, you should fix it.

11:41.420 --> 11:42.900
Come on. Please?

11:43.000 --> 11:44.460
Oh, God.

11:44.500 --> 11:46.380
Yes! Just like that,

11:46.440 --> 11:48.970
only louder and like you believe it!

11:51.210 --> 11:53.110
Just once to fake the kid out.

11:53.120 --> 11:54.970
Thank you! Thank you!

11:54.980 --> 11:57.070
- Yeah, get off me.
- Oh, sorry.

11:57.080 --> 11:59.179
And just so you know, it's
gonna be me and Mark.

11:59.180 --> 12:01.319
Harris is doing community
service for her school.

12:01.320 --> 12:02.380
There's a red tide,

12:02.390 --> 12:05.060
and she's shoveling dead
fish out of Lake Michigan.

12:05.800 --> 12:06.900
Lucky.

12:11.730 --> 12:13.490
Welcome to the group, friend.

12:13.500 --> 12:14.590
- What's your name?
- Dan.

12:14.600 --> 12:16.130
But everybody just keep going.

12:16.240 --> 12:17.330
I'm good.

12:17.400 --> 12:19.030
That's okay.

12:19.040 --> 12:20.470
No pressure to talk here.

12:22.060 --> 12:23.720
So, what brings you here, Dan?

12:25.800 --> 12:27.480
My wife died.

12:27.810 --> 12:28.860
And?

12:28.920 --> 12:31.640
I'm sorry. Were you looking
for something bigger?

12:31.680 --> 12:33.160
No.

12:33.200 --> 12:36.150
If you're like most of
us here, you're in pain,

12:36.180 --> 12:38.700
and I just figured you
needed someone to talk to.

12:38.990 --> 12:41.460
That's what my family thinks.

12:42.060 --> 12:43.739
And seeing as how I just blew up

12:43.740 --> 12:45.029
at a bunch of my best friends,

12:45.030 --> 12:46.460
maybe they're right.

12:46.470 --> 12:49.000
But I'd just like to listen for now.

12:49.050 --> 12:50.670
You know, we have a saying.

12:50.770 --> 12:52.940
If you won't open up, we can't come in.

12:54.340 --> 12:56.370
What if I don't want you to come in?

12:57.400 --> 12:59.580
I understand your fears,
but I want you to know

12:59.590 --> 13:01.340
I've been coming here for 20 years now,

13:01.350 --> 13:02.610
- and it really helps.
- Oh, my God,

13:02.620 --> 13:04.450
I can't come back here for 20 years.

13:04.470 --> 13:06.280
I'll talk.

13:07.620 --> 13:09.340
What am I supposed to say?

13:09.480 --> 13:11.460
Tell us what's bothering you.

13:11.700 --> 13:13.720
I don't know.

13:15.020 --> 13:16.850
You know when you're a little kid,

13:16.860 --> 13:18.300
and they tell you in Sunday school

13:18.320 --> 13:21.099
to live right, be a good
person, say your prayers,

13:21.100 --> 13:23.460
and God will reward you?

13:23.970 --> 13:25.300
I tried.

13:25.410 --> 13:27.140
I mean, I'm not just saying this.

13:27.150 --> 13:30.230
I busted my ass to play by the rules,

13:30.240 --> 13:31.550
and here's my reward.

13:31.560 --> 13:33.750
I'm 66 years old, and I get to live

13:33.780 --> 13:36.440
the rest of my life
without the woman I love.

13:37.260 --> 13:39.160
God and I made a deal.

13:39.260 --> 13:41.460
He did not come through on his end.

13:42.440 --> 13:44.620
Thanks for sharing, Dan.

13:44.720 --> 13:46.860
We hope you keep coming back.

13:47.460 --> 13:48.890
Anyone else want to share?

13:48.900 --> 13:50.320
Uh, excuse me.

13:50.440 --> 13:52.680
A-Aren't you gonna come in?

13:54.320 --> 13:56.700
We came in and listened.

13:56.860 --> 13:59.460
Don't you feel better
now that you've shared?

13:59.480 --> 14:01.160
No.

14:01.180 --> 14:02.440
No, I don't.

14:02.860 --> 14:04.860
Well, it takes time.

14:05.100 --> 14:06.280
Paulie.

14:06.300 --> 14:10.660
My wife is gone 20 years ago to the day,

14:10.760 --> 14:12.900
and it still feels
like it was yesterday.

14:13.120 --> 14:15.450
Now, I may have told this story before,

14:15.560 --> 14:16.740
but I picked up this book...

14:16.790 --> 14:18.110
I'm sorry to interrupt,
I'm sorry to interr...

14:18.120 --> 14:19.780
I was gonna leave, but then you stood up

14:19.790 --> 14:21.950
and started talking,
and it got personal,

14:21.990 --> 14:23.890
but I really didn't want to
stay for the whole thing.

14:23.900 --> 14:25.300
Uh...

14:25.400 --> 14:27.630
Here we are.

14:27.650 --> 14:28.680
Uh...

14:31.870 --> 14:34.220
Feel better, everybody.

14:39.420 --> 14:41.950
Darlene says we got to get going.

14:41.960 --> 14:43.850
Nothing like having a grumpy atheist

14:43.860 --> 14:45.790
wake you up at 7:00 in the morning

14:45.800 --> 14:48.420
telling you you're gonna
be late to church.

14:48.440 --> 14:50.080
I'm gonna have to meet you there.

14:50.100 --> 14:51.790
I need a couple of minutes
to finish this bike

14:51.800 --> 14:53.140
and load it on the trailer.

14:53.280 --> 14:54.740
You sold the bike?

14:54.840 --> 14:56.620
Yeah.

14:56.740 --> 14:58.200
I'm delivering it to the new owner

14:58.210 --> 14:59.830
right after church.

15:00.040 --> 15:02.620
Your mom didn't want
me riding it, anyway.

15:02.780 --> 15:04.070
She was afraid I'd get killed

15:04.080 --> 15:05.450
and she'd have to raise you alone.

15:07.090 --> 15:09.480
She said "You helped make this mess,

15:09.490 --> 15:11.249
you're not dumping it all on me."

15:17.020 --> 15:20.360
So, when you lost Mark...

15:22.170 --> 15:24.750
... did you ever find a cure
for waking up every morning

15:24.780 --> 15:26.480
and looking for him?

15:26.940 --> 15:31.920
Darlene and I got drunk one
night and talked about...

15:32.340 --> 15:34.250
how I never really sat still long enough

15:34.280 --> 15:36.470
to make sense of it all.

15:36.480 --> 15:38.120
So, I went home

15:38.150 --> 15:41.280
and parked myself in a chair for a week,

15:41.460 --> 15:45.190
and by blocking out all
the noise in my life,

15:45.290 --> 15:46.980
I got some clarity,

15:47.140 --> 15:50.080
and I figured out how to move forward.

15:50.400 --> 15:52.260
So, you did it all by yourself?

15:53.540 --> 15:56.160
Then why were you pushing
me to sit around,

15:56.170 --> 15:58.480
talk to a bunch of strangers in a group?

15:58.560 --> 16:00.800
Because it kind of helped.

16:00.810 --> 16:02.760
And everyone was really
concerned about you,

16:02.770 --> 16:06.270
and I didn't want it to
seem like I didn't care.

16:06.400 --> 16:09.060
Oh, so you don't care.

16:10.350 --> 16:12.660
No. I just know you.

16:13.260 --> 16:16.390
Nobody's gonna tell you
how to fix something.

16:17.820 --> 16:19.200
Time to go.

16:19.260 --> 16:22.120
How long do we have to stay?

16:22.240 --> 16:24.890
Just long enough for
God to see your face.

16:24.900 --> 16:26.650
And by God, I mean Geena.

16:27.550 --> 16:29.080
_

16:34.810 --> 16:36.600
So, when are we gonna get back out there

16:36.610 --> 16:38.200
and finish that polling project?

16:38.610 --> 16:41.160
I kind of changed it into an essay.

16:41.280 --> 16:43.350
It's about how people don't listen.

16:43.450 --> 16:45.260
They just yell at each other.

16:45.320 --> 16:47.610
And if we don't start
listening and being nicer,

16:47.620 --> 16:49.070
we'll never be able to get along.

16:49.080 --> 16:50.080
I know.

16:50.090 --> 16:52.420
Those people at the mall
were complete jerks.

16:54.060 --> 16:56.520
Welcome, everyone. God is good.

16:56.580 --> 16:57.820
All the time.

16:57.900 --> 17:00.430
- All the time?
- All the time!

17:00.580 --> 17:02.220
- God is good.
- Yeah, he's good.

17:03.580 --> 17:05.469
You have such a progressive church

17:05.470 --> 17:06.760
to have a woman preacher.

17:06.770 --> 17:07.960
Oh, the preacher comes out later.

17:07.970 --> 17:09.630
That's the deaconess.

17:09.640 --> 17:11.220
Oh, so you mean like an M.C.?

17:11.260 --> 17:13.739
Oh. Oh. I'm learning so much.

17:13.740 --> 17:16.200
That's the deaconess.
Preacher comes out later.

17:16.250 --> 17:18.240
That's the deaconess.
Preacher comes out later.

17:18.319 --> 17:19.700
That's the deaconess.

17:19.720 --> 17:21.140
The preacher comes out later.

17:22.849 --> 17:25.510
I would like to point out
that one of our congregation

17:25.520 --> 17:28.380
has just returned from serving
our country overseas.

17:28.390 --> 17:31.120
Geena Conner, would you
stand and be recognized?

17:34.380 --> 17:38.060
Baby, people stopped
raising the roof in 2005.

17:38.070 --> 17:40.660
I understand that the rest of
the Conners are here, too.

17:40.670 --> 17:42.170
Stand up so we know who you are.

17:43.440 --> 17:45.560
I'm just teasing. We know who you are.

17:47.580 --> 17:50.040
Okay, everyone, would you please rise,

17:50.060 --> 17:52.180
as we praise God with a song?

17:53.590 --> 17:56.820
♪ This little light of mine ♪

17:56.850 --> 17:59.070
♪ I'm gonna let it shine ♪

17:59.080 --> 18:00.080
♪ Yeah ♪

18:00.090 --> 18:03.320

18:03.330 --> 18:05.600

♪ Whoo ♪

18:06.830 --> 18:09.230
- Whoo!
- ♪ This little light of mine ♪

18:10.320 --> 18:12.560
Hey, I got your text.

18:12.570 --> 18:13.760
What happened?

18:13.780 --> 18:15.759
I wanted to help D.J.,

18:15.760 --> 18:17.540
but I got to the church.

18:17.660 --> 18:19.970
I just couldn't go in.

18:19.980 --> 18:22.820
I'm not in a great place
with God right now.

18:24.120 --> 18:26.740
Dad, you got to tell us
how we can help you.

18:26.760 --> 18:28.080
You can't.

18:28.090 --> 18:30.120
I have to do this myself.

18:30.200 --> 18:31.640
But you're not.

18:31.680 --> 18:33.320
You know, you're not talking to us.

18:33.360 --> 18:34.720
You're not talking to your friends.

18:34.740 --> 18:36.540
- You won't go to a meeting.
- I went.

18:37.760 --> 18:39.570
It was a bunch of people yammering on

18:39.580 --> 18:41.020
about how they'll never get over

18:41.060 --> 18:43.360
the loss of their husbands and wives.

18:43.370 --> 18:46.470
From what I saw, it was
the fun ones who died.

18:49.740 --> 18:51.640
All right, so...

18:51.760 --> 18:53.679
what do we do now?

18:53.680 --> 18:56.740
Well, I don't know about you,

18:56.980 --> 18:58.910
but I'm going for a ride.

18:58.940 --> 19:01.720
Boy, I sure hope you got a
bicycle in here someplace.

19:01.780 --> 19:03.520
Nope.

19:03.680 --> 19:06.340
You're... you're 65 years old.

19:06.460 --> 19:07.660
You haven't ridden in forever.

19:07.680 --> 19:08.919
Why are you doing this?

19:08.920 --> 19:11.330
Because I need to.

19:11.430 --> 19:12.890
I'm gonna get out on the road

19:12.900 --> 19:15.340
and ride till I feel better.

19:15.830 --> 19:17.380
Or feel something.

19:17.420 --> 19:19.840
Hitting the pavement
at 80 miles an hour,

19:19.860 --> 19:22.320
you're definitely gonna feel something.

19:23.240 --> 19:24.500
Who knows.

19:24.510 --> 19:27.110
Maybe God and I will meet up at a bar,

19:27.210 --> 19:28.910
and he'll pick up the tab.

19:29.010 --> 19:31.300
He really owes me.

19:31.340 --> 19:32.940
All right.

19:32.950 --> 19:35.220
How about this compromise?

19:35.300 --> 19:37.020
You talk to God

19:37.120 --> 19:39.200
while you're watching "Easy Rider"

19:39.220 --> 19:40.880
from your chair in the front yard.

19:40.960 --> 19:42.680
I love you.

19:46.660 --> 19:48.860
Oh, you're so young.

19:53.710 --> 19:55.760
- Uh, dad?
- Yeah?

19:55.840 --> 19:57.420
Say "hi" to Mom.

20:01.840 --> 20:03.199
By the end of the night,

20:03.200 --> 20:05.700
I'm gonna own that sweet
motorcycle of yours.

20:05.740 --> 20:06.850
It's not on table.

20:06.860 --> 20:09.540
I'm having too much fun riding it.

20:11.520 --> 20:13.120
That sounds pretty good.

20:13.140 --> 20:15.140
How come Anne-Marie wanted
it out of the house?

20:15.150 --> 20:17.499
Eh, she's convinced
the Bluetooth speaker
