"Forever Hold Your Peace"
Closed Captioned

00:02.001 --> 00:02.753
Previously on 90210:

00:02.878 --> 00:05.798
I know that you quit the
seminary because of me.

00:05.923 --> 00:08.132
ANNIE: I hope you don't feel
like you made a mistake.

00:08.258 --> 00:11.428
CALEB: I broke my vow.
We gave in to temptation.

00:11.553 --> 00:13.639
What we did,
we did out of love.

00:13.764 --> 00:16.140
And that doesn't make you
weak or unworthy.

00:16.265 --> 00:19.770
IVY: Why would you
give him a fake I.D?
Because I don't have a real one

00:19.895 --> 00:22.857
I'm in this country illegally.
IVY: We think we figured out
a way to buy Diego

00:22.982 --> 00:24.942
a little bit more time.
Police won't touch me

00:25.066 --> 00:27.235
if I take
sanctuary in a church.

00:27.361 --> 00:29.279
I'm really sorry for all the
things I said about

00:29.404 --> 00:31.323
not being able
to trust you.

00:31.448 --> 00:32.533
Will you be my manager again?

00:32.658 --> 00:34.535
Hey, what are you two
doing here?

00:34.660 --> 00:36.203
I'm here for you.
He just got here.

00:36.328 --> 00:38.831
I was here
for you ten minutes ago.

00:38.956 --> 00:41.082
Neither of us are going to give
up until you make a choice.

00:41.208 --> 00:44.545
Fine, I want to have a baby.
Which one of you is up for that?

00:44.670 --> 00:45.921
NAOMI: It's still a little
crazy that I am

00:46.045 --> 00:47.255
planning your wedding.

00:47.381 --> 00:48.799
MADISON: You mean because
of you and Max?

00:48.924 --> 00:49.466
It's ancient history.

00:49.591 --> 00:51.927
Okay, I'm still
in love with Max.

00:52.051 --> 00:54.137
Well, then that's what he needs
to know before he marries her.

00:54.262 --> 00:56.431
Am I making a mistake?

01:01.020 --> 01:05.607
♪ ♪

01:12.740 --> 01:14.909
Hi, Max, it's me again.
Um... (chuckles)

01:15.034 --> 01:18.495
You're strangely absent
from your wedding rehearsal.

01:18.620 --> 01:20.581
I hope nothing happened to make
you change your mind.

01:20.706 --> 01:21.623
(chuckles) Just kidding.

01:21.749 --> 01:24.877
Hey, listen, we, uh,
need to talk about

01:25.002 --> 01:25.920
happened between us
last night,

01:26.045 --> 01:28.505
so call me.

01:28.630 --> 01:30.340
Same old Naomi.
Oh.

01:30.465 --> 01:30.966
Sleeping with the clients.

01:31.090 --> 01:33.427
Rachel... um...

01:33.552 --> 01:35.012
Not that it's any
of your business,

01:35.136 --> 01:36.972
but nothing happened
between me and the client.

01:37.096 --> 01:39.683
I'm kidding. I didn't
come here to cause trouble.

01:39.808 --> 01:41.977
I heard you booked
the Madison Stewart wedding.

01:42.101 --> 01:44.063
And I wanted to see how
I possibly lost

01:44.187 --> 01:46.941
this job to one of
my former interns.

01:47.066 --> 01:48.943
Now I see why.

01:49.068 --> 01:51.403
I beat you out on this job?

01:51.528 --> 01:53.822
Yes, and that got me thinking...

01:53.948 --> 01:57.659
Holly's heading my new London
office, I'm handling L.A.,

01:57.785 --> 02:01.162
but I've yet to find the right
point person for New York.

02:01.288 --> 02:04.291
Rachel...
(chuckles)

02:04.416 --> 02:06.627
Are you offering me a job?
I am.

02:06.752 --> 02:09.003
I know you have
your own company.

02:09.128 --> 02:11.381
But coming to work with me,
would be making a jump

02:11.506 --> 02:12.549
on an international scale.

02:12.674 --> 02:15.385
NAOMI: Oh.
We have a little situation.

02:15.510 --> 02:17.096
Oh, nothing I can't handle.

02:17.220 --> 02:19.723
Uh, Madison is still hungover
from the bachelorette party.

02:19.848 --> 02:21.558
And she's, uh, throwing up
in the redwoods.

02:21.683 --> 02:23.811
We can't have
a rehearsal without a bride.

02:23.936 --> 02:26.354
Which is why she wants you
to stand in for her.

02:28.607 --> 02:31.693
Oh, (chuckles) well,
absolutely. Not a problem.

02:31.819 --> 02:34.780
Okay, you go to the altar,
and I'll meet you up there.

02:34.905 --> 02:36.490
All right?

02:36.615 --> 02:38.575
Looks like you've got
your hands full.

02:38.700 --> 02:39.910
Ah.
Think over my offer.

02:40.035 --> 02:44.414
I will.

02:44.539 --> 02:47.208
Now, I'm going to go marry
my ex-boyfriend.

02:47.334 --> 02:48.752
SARA: Okay, let me
get this straight,

02:48.877 --> 02:50.796
you have a history
of criminal activity...?

02:50.921 --> 02:54.049
IVY: ...for street art.
It's not like anybody got hurt.

02:54.173 --> 02:57.344
But most recently,
you stole a guards I.D,

02:57.469 --> 02:59.429
and you broke Ivy
out of a psych ward?

02:59.554 --> 03:00.973
Well, that sounds way worse
than it actually is.

03:01.098 --> 03:05.393
I agreed to let the church
provide sanctuary for Diego.

03:05.519 --> 03:07.729
Please, I'd like to
know our options.

03:07.855 --> 03:10.691
Well, if Diego's
marital status were different

03:10.816 --> 03:14.903
or if you were a model citizen,
I would be more optimistic.

03:15.029 --> 03:19.491
But if we were to petition for a
green card and he loses,

03:19.616 --> 03:22.410
he might never
be able to return.

03:22.536 --> 03:24.997
That's it?
Are you kidding me?

03:25.122 --> 03:28.416
He either runs
or he gets deported?

03:28.542 --> 03:31.712
I'm not running. I mean, I...
look, I was prepared to run

03:31.837 --> 03:34.506
but I feel like I've been
running my whole life.

03:34.631 --> 03:36.800
If I stay and fight, at least
Ivy and I have a chance.

03:36.925 --> 03:39.219
Come on, there's got to be
something we can do.

03:39.344 --> 03:42.347
Hold a rally.
Start a petition.

03:42.472 --> 03:43.974
If you can
get enough attention,

03:44.099 --> 03:45.726
your Senator can
file a special bill

03:45.851 --> 03:47.061
and you can get
a green card.

03:47.186 --> 03:49.312
Well, that's
what we need to do.

03:49.437 --> 03:51.857
Caleb, wait,
I'm not unsympathetic

03:51.982 --> 03:55.777
to Diego's situation.
But, uh, I'm not sure what

03:55.903 --> 03:57.821
the churches role
should be in this case.

03:57.946 --> 04:01.575
The churches role is to
do the right thing in any case.

04:01.700 --> 04:03.410
Proverbs 31 says
we should speak up

04:03.535 --> 04:05.746
for those who are not able to
speak up for themselves.

04:05.871 --> 04:07.748
Is that not why
we follow this path,

04:07.873 --> 04:09.791
so we could live by the
teachings of the Bible?

04:09.917 --> 04:11.710
You're right.

04:11.835 --> 04:14.880
All right, well,
I'm going to get in touch

04:15.005 --> 04:16.173
with the Senators office
and find out

04:16.297 --> 04:17.548
how many signatures we need.

04:17.673 --> 04:19.426
Yeah, and I'll start figuring
out how to throw together

04:19.551 --> 04:20.219
a rally in a couple days.

04:20.343 --> 04:22.470
Thank you.
ANNIE: Mm-hm.

04:22.596 --> 04:23.931
IVY:
This is going to work, okay?

04:25.515 --> 04:27.642
Hey, Caleb, uh, wait.

04:27.768 --> 04:29.644
I'm really glad that
we're going to be helping.

04:29.770 --> 04:33.440
And I don't want this
to sound selfish but

04:33.565 --> 04:35.817
if we're going to be working
with the church on this...

04:35.943 --> 04:38.403
Then does that mean I'm going to
get pulled back in?

04:38.528 --> 04:41.949
Yeah. You know, just like
The Godfather,

04:42.074 --> 04:44.325
(chuckles)
without the shooting part.

04:44.451 --> 04:47.996
Before Ivy and Diego came in,
you asked me if I regretted

04:48.122 --> 04:49.706
what happened between us.

04:49.831 --> 04:50.916
And?

04:51.041 --> 04:53.835
No, I want to
be with you, Annie.

04:53.961 --> 04:55.545
(chuckles)

05:02.385 --> 05:04.512
ADRIANNA:
♪ And I don't like your joke ♪

05:04.638 --> 05:07.307
♪ I laugh to be polite. ♪

05:07.432 --> 05:11.561
♪ But now it's just a chore... ♪

05:11.686 --> 05:13.647
(laughs) Nice phone,
princess.

05:13.772 --> 05:15.440
(chuckles) It's Ade's.

05:15.565 --> 05:17.776
She gave it to me so I could
watch this video

05:17.901 --> 05:19.778
Silver took of her, singing at
the bachelorette party.

05:19.903 --> 05:22.447
Check it out.
It's already gone viral.

05:22.572 --> 05:24.407
Nice.
Yeah.

05:24.532 --> 05:26.285
Man, my dad was
so ready to tell me

05:26.409 --> 05:27.327
"I told you so"
about managing Ade.

05:27.452 --> 05:29.830
But after he heard her sing,

05:29.955 --> 05:31.623
he agreed to give her
a second chance.

05:31.748 --> 05:33.625
And she is opening
for him on tour.

05:33.750 --> 05:34.918
Starting in....

05:35.043 --> 05:36.295
Vegas, baby!

05:36.419 --> 05:37.754
(both chuckles)
Nice.

05:37.879 --> 05:41.091
(cell phone rings)

05:41.925 --> 05:44.343
Um...

05:44.469 --> 05:46.096
You heard from Dix?
Not since he left

05:46.221 --> 05:48.182
to go on tour
with Haley Reinhart.

05:48.307 --> 05:50.017
I think they're done
in a couple weeks.

05:50.142 --> 05:52.811
Well, I can't say, uh,
I'm sorry we'll miss him.

05:52.936 --> 05:54.980
I can't have any unfinished
business with Dixon,

05:55.105 --> 05:57.691
getting in the way of this
opportunity, for either of us.

05:57.816 --> 06:00.319
Yeah, well, sometimes
it's hard to let things go

06:00.443 --> 06:02.237
even when you know
they're not meant to be.

06:02.361 --> 06:03.905
You too, huh?

06:04.031 --> 06:05.699
Still hung up on Silver?

06:05.824 --> 06:08.451
All right,
if by hung up, you mean

06:08.576 --> 06:09.494
I really like her,
then yes.

06:09.619 --> 06:11.913
There's just
something about her.

06:12.039 --> 06:14.791
Hey, don't you think it's time
you get on with your life, dude?

06:14.916 --> 06:17.085
Yeah, well, that's easy
for you to say.

06:17.211 --> 06:19.338
Fact of the matter is,
I don't have the girl.

06:19.462 --> 06:20.881
Vanessa took me
for everything I'm worth.

06:21.006 --> 06:24.009
And the nicest thing any reviews
said about my movie was

06:24.134 --> 06:24.968
"At least it's finally over."

06:25.093 --> 06:28.096
(chuckles) Hm.

06:28.222 --> 06:29.681
And you don't count 55 million

06:29.806 --> 06:31.933
at the box office opening
weekend, a success.

06:32.059 --> 06:33.643
What are you talking about?
What am I talking about?

06:37.689 --> 06:38.940
This guy.

06:39.066 --> 06:39.858
Studio sent it.

06:39.983 --> 06:41.360
See, look...

06:41.484 --> 06:42.485
"Congratulations,
55 million dollars

06:42.610 --> 06:44.445
proves that critics
were wrong."

06:44.571 --> 06:47.574
I thought it was so bad that the
movie would surely tank.

06:47.699 --> 06:50.118
Like, I purposely didn't keep
track of how much money it made.

06:50.244 --> 06:51.452
Ah, well, consensus is,
it was so bad

06:51.578 --> 06:53.330
that it circled around
to be good.

06:53.454 --> 06:56.541
Looks like one part of your
life's looking up.

06:56.666 --> 07:00.045
So, if you ask me, I say stop
focusing on what you don't have

07:00.170 --> 07:02.589
and enjoy what you do.

07:02.714 --> 07:04.258
AUSTIN:
Cheers, buddy.

07:14.351 --> 07:15.518
(knocking door)

07:15.643 --> 07:17.396
Hey...

07:18.188 --> 07:19.856
Uh, you busy?

07:19.981 --> 07:21.816
Just reading through
some IVF pamphlets.

07:21.942 --> 07:24.194
(sighs) So, no...
Come in.

07:27.906 --> 07:31.451
Uh, you were right about
what you said last night.

07:31.576 --> 07:33.536
You don't deserve
to have two idiots

07:33.661 --> 07:35.830
acting like your
some kind of prize.

07:35.956 --> 07:38.625
Well, I'm sorry too.
That was really harsh.

07:38.750 --> 07:41.586
No, I get it. You need to know
you'll be safe from cancer

07:41.711 --> 07:45.340
which means, if you want to have
a kid, you have to do it now.

07:47.634 --> 07:48.927
So, okay.

07:49.052 --> 07:51.679
I'll do it.

07:51.805 --> 07:54.766
What?
Yeah, I come from
a big family.

07:54.891 --> 07:57.102
I've been around a lot of
babies, I can do this.

07:57.227 --> 07:58.270
(chuckles)
Navid...

07:58.395 --> 08:00.647
Think about this,
this is a huge thing to offer.

08:00.772 --> 08:03.317
Yeah, I know. But I thought
about it all night

08:03.442 --> 08:05.819
and I've come back
to the same thing.

08:05.944 --> 08:09.114
And if this is, this is
something you need,

08:09.239 --> 08:10.365
I'll have a baby with you.

08:10.490 --> 08:13.201
(laughs)

08:13.327 --> 08:16.579
(both laughing)

08:22.794 --> 08:26.298
Okay, once everyone
is at the altar,

08:26.423 --> 08:28.549
the bride, not me,
I'm obviously not the bride,

08:28.675 --> 08:31.261
will follow...
Walk, walk, walk...

08:31.386 --> 08:33.347
Father of the bride
will sit here.

08:33.472 --> 08:34.764
(sobbing)
Oh...

08:34.889 --> 08:36.850
You know this is just the
rehearsal, right?

08:36.975 --> 08:38.809
Oh, I know.

08:38.934 --> 08:41.813
It's just you look so beautiful
and I can't believe

08:41.938 --> 08:43.648
my little girl's
getting married.

08:46.109 --> 08:48.487
And then the gospel choir will
sing "Baby I Need Your Love"

08:48.611 --> 08:51.531
and so appropriate.
Kiki will read a poem, um,

08:51.656 --> 08:53.741
about the sanctity of marriage.

08:53.867 --> 08:55.827
And then we'll
exchange our vows...

08:55.952 --> 08:58.038
And by we, I mean you guys.

08:58.163 --> 09:00.290
Yeah.
And Max will kiss the bride.

09:05.920 --> 09:09.341
And you know how the rest of it
goes, rehearsal over.

09:09.466 --> 09:10.550
Okay, good bye everyone.

09:18.099 --> 09:20.018
Are you okay?

09:22.437 --> 09:24.439
I'm sorry about that.

09:24.605 --> 09:27.984
I've been trying to be
professional.

09:28.109 --> 09:29.610
But this is happening, Max.

09:29.736 --> 09:32.531
It's a "no turning back, speak
now or forever

09:32.655 --> 09:36.493
hold you peace"
kind of thing. So...

09:36.617 --> 09:40.788
I need to know.
Last night,

09:40.914 --> 09:43.833
why did you ask me
if you were making a mistake?

09:50.382 --> 09:53.260
We talked last night?

09:53.385 --> 09:55.178
Wow.

09:55.303 --> 09:57.514
I must have been
drunker than I thought.

09:57.638 --> 10:01.184
Um, so you don't even
remember talking to me.

10:01.309 --> 10:05.188
I hope I didn't...
make a fool of myself.

10:05.313 --> 10:06.523
(chuckles)
No, you're not the fool.

10:06.647 --> 10:10.068
Um, you should...
Yeah. I've, uh...

10:10.193 --> 10:11.528
Don't worry.
I will get back to

10:11.652 --> 10:14.155
making your wedding
absolutely perfect.

10:14.281 --> 10:16.324
(chuckles)
Happily ever after and all that.

10:19.702 --> 10:20.995
Yeah.

10:28.128 --> 10:32.424
(theme music playing)

10:47.814 --> 10:50.066
Oh, my God, it's totally you.

10:50.191 --> 10:52.110
(chuckles)
It's totally me.

10:52.235 --> 10:53.861
I watched your video
like 25 times.

10:53.987 --> 10:55.655
Check it out,
I had this made.

10:55.780 --> 10:57.616
(chuckles)
You're an inspiration.

10:57.740 --> 11:00.619
Thank you. Yeah, it just
feels good to let go

11:00.743 --> 11:02.579
of the past
and move on, you know?

11:02.703 --> 11:03.204
I know, right?

11:03.330 --> 11:05.206
I hope your ex is dead.

11:05.332 --> 11:06.416
What?

11:06.541 --> 11:08.335
No, I... I don't want him dead.

11:08.460 --> 11:09.669
Well, I do.

11:09.794 --> 11:12.130
Can you call my boyfriend
and break up with him for me?

11:12.255 --> 11:14.633
How 'bout I just sign
your shirt instead?

11:25.477 --> 11:27.854
Oh, don't let the
weird fans bother you.

11:27.979 --> 11:29.063
Okay.

11:29.189 --> 11:30.440
I had a guy
come up to me today and say

11:30.565 --> 11:32.233
"I want to blow
your brains out."

11:32.359 --> 11:34.027
And he wanted a high-five.

11:34.152 --> 11:36.737
Kind of freaked me out until I
realized it was my catch phrase.

11:36.863 --> 11:38.072
I have a catch phrase.

11:38.198 --> 11:39.782
The paparazzi-- man!

11:39.907 --> 11:42.035
I was at the gas station
and some dude comes up to me

11:42.160 --> 11:43.119
takes a picture,
and he was, like,

11:43.244 --> 11:44.663
"The world wants to know

11:44.787 --> 11:46.747
if Liam Court pumps
regular or premium."

11:46.873 --> 11:49.209
It's premium.

11:49.334 --> 11:51.961
The point is I'm trying
to stay positive

11:52.086 --> 11:54.088
so I don't have to
think about Silver.

11:54.214 --> 11:56.049
Is it working?

11:56.174 --> 11:59.052
Sure.

11:59.177 --> 12:01.471
Unless I want to have
a baby with Silver,

12:01.596 --> 12:02.639
it's pretty much
all I've got.

12:08.353 --> 12:09.187
Well, hello.

12:11.314 --> 12:12.940
What are you doing?

12:13.066 --> 12:14.942
Yeah, I'm bein' sexy.

12:15.068 --> 12:16.027
What does it look like?

12:20.031 --> 12:21.074
Okay, uh, well,

12:21.199 --> 12:22.909
if the sexy thing
isn't working,

12:23.034 --> 12:25.453
how about... romantic?

12:25.579 --> 12:27.581
I...

12:27.706 --> 12:29.999
bought you flowers.

12:30.124 --> 12:32.126
Oh, wow!
Right?

12:32.252 --> 12:33.127
Thank you.
(laughs)

12:33.253 --> 12:35.963
I got something, too.

12:36.089 --> 12:37.965
What's this?

12:40.968 --> 12:44.180
An ovulation kit
and a calendar.
Ooh. Yeah.

12:44.305 --> 12:45.848
Bow-chicka-bow-wow.

12:45.973 --> 12:49.352
I have spent so much time
trying not to get pregnant,

12:49.477 --> 12:50.437
this is weird.
Yeah.

12:50.562 --> 12:52.063
It's like I'm gonna
get in trouble.

12:52.188 --> 12:54.733
Well, hey, I'll
give you trouble.

12:54.857 --> 12:56.859
That wasn't romantic
or sexy, was it?
I'm sorry.

12:56.984 --> 12:59.529
Navid, look, it's super sweet
that you've done all this

12:59.654 --> 13:01.864
but you don't have
to work so hard.

13:01.989 --> 13:03.408
The whole baby thing
sort of guarantees

13:03.533 --> 13:04.659
you're gonna get lucky.

13:04.783 --> 13:05.619
Yeah, I know.

13:05.744 --> 13:07.412
I doesn't have to be
all clinical baby-making.

13:07.537 --> 13:10.373
We do love each other.

13:10.498 --> 13:14.502
But... I mean, we're not...
Right?

13:14.628 --> 13:15.545
You don't think we're
gonna get back together.

13:15.670 --> 13:16.003
No, no, no, no,
I mean, uh...

13:16.129 --> 13:17.589
Aah! I don't know.

13:17.714 --> 13:19.048
Good.
I mean, were you?

13:19.173 --> 13:23.094
Well, I mean I've... been so
focused on having a baby

13:23.219 --> 13:26.222
that I haven't really given us,
as a couple, a thought.

13:26.347 --> 13:28.807
Ah... yeah...
But...

13:28.933 --> 13:29.684
I mean, a relationship,
you know,

13:29.808 --> 13:31.102
it's a whole other thing.

13:31.227 --> 13:33.730
Yeah.
And you and I have
had our problems.

13:33.854 --> 13:35.940
We're not even sure we
want to be together, right?

13:36.065 --> 13:37.525
I haven't even
thought that far ahead.

13:37.651 --> 13:38.985
Absolutely.

13:39.110 --> 13:43.030
Yeah, we're, uh...
right on the same page.

13:43.156 --> 13:45.950
Yeah, you can just think
of me as your stud bull.

13:46.075 --> 13:48.035
Okay. Good.

13:48.161 --> 13:49.621
Yeah.

13:55.543 --> 13:57.128
We should take a
trip somewhere.

13:57.253 --> 13:59.255
Just the two of us.

13:59.380 --> 14:00.799
Yeah.
We should go to Paris.

14:00.923 --> 14:02.216
Ooh! And Rome.

14:02.342 --> 14:04.927
Actually, Rome's probably not
the best idea.

14:05.052 --> 14:07.472
I know this was a really hard
choice for you to make

14:07.597 --> 14:09.848
and it could be super-awkward
to bump into the Pope.

14:09.974 --> 14:12.977
Wherever you are, that's
where I want to be.

14:13.102 --> 14:14.187
(chuckles)

14:14.312 --> 14:18.358
I spent six hours,
thousand of dollars,

14:18.483 --> 14:19.651
but do I feel better about

14:19.776 --> 14:21.402
this stupid Max getting
married thing?

14:21.528 --> 14:23.154
No, I do not.

14:23.279 --> 14:26.491
And you two smooching all over
each other doesn't help.

14:26.616 --> 14:28.993
Well, I should
get going, anyway.

14:29.118 --> 14:31.538
I have to talk to Ivy
and Diego about tomorrow.

14:33.456 --> 14:36.292
How many pairs of shoes
did you buy, girl?

14:36.417 --> 14:38.085
I stopped counting at 20.

14:38.211 --> 14:40.087
Oh.
There's more bags in the car.

14:40.213 --> 14:43.758
Okay, I have never seen shopping
leave you listless before.

14:43.883 --> 14:45.176
You want to talk about it?

14:45.301 --> 14:48.054
I kissed Max.
What?!

14:48.179 --> 14:49.972
Only as part of the rehearsal,

14:50.097 --> 14:52.141
but... (sighs heavily)

14:52.266 --> 14:55.520
My knees went weak...

14:55.645 --> 14:56.521
and he felt nothing.

14:56.646 --> 14:57.938
Oh...

14:58.064 --> 14:59.440
He said that?

14:59.566 --> 15:02.276
In not so many words, but, yes.

15:02.402 --> 15:04.821
So I guess he gets to marry
his perfect girl

15:04.945 --> 15:06.823
and she isn't me.

15:06.947 --> 15:09.033
Thank God it's going
to be over soon,

15:09.158 --> 15:11.160
and I'll have to watch Madison
live the life

15:11.285 --> 15:12.161
that could've been mine.

15:12.286 --> 15:15.456
Ding-dong! It's me!

15:15.582 --> 15:17.876
Ooh! Looks like someone did
a lot of shopping today.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.919
Fun.
Yes.

15:20.044 --> 15:21.962
Anyways, I came by to
drop off a gift,

15:22.088 --> 15:25.091
to say thank you for standing
in for me at the rehearsal.

15:26.467 --> 15:28.595
Wow. All right.

15:28.720 --> 15:29.721
Oh...

15:29.846 --> 15:30.930
Is that a Renoir?

15:31.055 --> 15:32.973
Just a sketch.

15:33.099 --> 15:34.267
Renoir could create masterpieces

15:34.392 --> 15:36.018
in such a short amount of time,

15:36.143 --> 15:38.062
and that's how
I feel about

15:38.187 --> 15:40.565
what you've done for
our wedding, Naomi.

15:40.690 --> 15:42.525
Just doing my job.

15:42.650 --> 15:45.278
I hope it's
a little more than that.

15:45.403 --> 15:47.739
I think of you
as a good friend.

15:47.864 --> 15:52.243
And... well...
when I first met you,

15:52.368 --> 15:54.662
I noticed the open house
across the street,

15:54.788 --> 15:57.373
and, long story short,
we put in an offer

15:57.498 --> 15:59.834
and it was accepted.
(giggles)

15:59.959 --> 16:01.461
Tell me you're as
happy as I am.

16:01.586 --> 16:02.086
We're gonna be neighbors?

16:02.211 --> 16:03.254
Can you believe it?

16:03.379 --> 16:05.298
Oh!

16:05.423 --> 16:06.549
Oh, my God!
You're crying!

16:06.674 --> 16:08.676
Stop it! You're gonna
make me cry!

16:10.553 --> 16:12.472
(forced laughter)

16:18.519 --> 16:19.687
So thank you all
for coming out.

16:19.813 --> 16:23.190
We have free tacos,
courtesy of Liam Court.

16:23.316 --> 16:25.109
(cheering)

16:25.234 --> 16:28.863
Adrianna Tate-Duncan
will be singing in a bit.

16:28.988 --> 16:31.157
Please don't forget to
sign our petition

16:31.282 --> 16:33.618
to help keep Diego Flores
in the country.

16:33.743 --> 16:36.078
(chanting):
Diego! Diego! Diego!

16:36.203 --> 16:38.998
♪ ♪

16:39.123 --> 16:40.541
You ready to make
this crowd feel like

16:40.667 --> 16:42.209
kicking their exes
to the curb? Huh?

16:42.335 --> 16:43.920
Uh, yeah, I...

16:44.044 --> 16:46.673
I'm thinking that maybe I should
sing something other than

16:46.798 --> 16:48.466
"I Don't Want You Anymore."

16:48.591 --> 16:50.134
Okay. Good idea.

16:50.259 --> 16:52.512
Yeah?
Yeah. Let's just skip
singing altogether

16:52.637 --> 16:56.056
get up there and just, uh,
make some balloon animals.

16:56.182 --> 16:57.851
Are you kidding me?

16:57.976 --> 17:00.186
Why would you want to
sing something else?
That's your hit.

17:00.311 --> 17:03.189
Well, it's not really in the
spirit of the event, right?

17:04.190 --> 17:06.818
Okay, it's Dixon.

17:06.943 --> 17:09.362
I wrote that song
feeling one way,

17:09.487 --> 17:10.905
and now I'm starting
to feel another.

17:11.030 --> 17:12.114
Do not second-guess
yourself.

17:12.239 --> 17:13.657
And as your manager,
I'm telling you

17:13.782 --> 17:15.159
do not let your feelings
for Dixon

17:15.284 --> 17:16.743
get in the way of your career.

17:16.869 --> 17:21.374
As your friend, he picked
his music over you, Ade.

17:21.499 --> 17:23.835
You deserve
better than that.

17:23.960 --> 17:25.002
Okay?

17:32.802 --> 17:34.053
Hey, man.
She okay?

17:34.178 --> 17:35.471
Yeah, she's fine.

17:35.596 --> 17:37.557
You know,
baggage with the ex.

17:37.682 --> 17:39.976
Ah. Yeah. Seems to be
going around lately.

17:40.100 --> 17:42.896
What about you?
You okay?

17:43.021 --> 17:45.606
Yeah. Okay, uh...

17:45.732 --> 17:46.399
Baby-making sex went
really weird with Silver,

17:46.524 --> 17:48.609
but other than that,
I'm fine.

17:51.404 --> 17:54.532
Oh, sorry. I opened my mouth;
it just kind of spilled out.

17:54.657 --> 17:56.993
NAVID: But I'm just
trying to help her out.

17:57.117 --> 17:58.745
She asked me if I
thought that meant we're
getting back together,

17:58.870 --> 18:00.997
I said no, but I realized,
yeah, it kinda did, you know?

18:01.121 --> 18:05.501
Look, man, uh...

18:05.626 --> 18:07.587
if you want to know if Silver's
in it for the long haul,

18:07.712 --> 18:09.964
I think you gotta
lay it out for her.

18:10.089 --> 18:12.759
Before she has this baby.
Yeah.

18:12.884 --> 18:16.721
And so we're clear, I never
want to hear the phrase

18:16.846 --> 18:19.181
"baby-making sex" ever again.

18:19.306 --> 18:20.934
Okay?

18:21.059 --> 18:22.226
Enjoy your tacos, guys,

18:22.351 --> 18:23.937
and please don't forget
to sign the petition.

18:25.521 --> 18:26.940
Hey.
Hi.

18:27.065 --> 18:29.525
How are you?

18:29.650 --> 18:31.235
I'm good. Yeah.
How are you?

18:31.360 --> 18:34.781
I'm-I'm good. Good. Uh...

18:34.906 --> 18:36.741
The movie, uh,
did really well,

18:36.866 --> 18:37.700
which was a nice surprise.

18:37.825 --> 18:38.868
That's great.

18:38.993 --> 18:39.911
I mean, you deserve it.

18:40.036 --> 18:40.870
I'm happy for you.

18:40.995 --> 18:42.705
I'm happy for you.

18:42.830 --> 18:46.000
You know, just...
just in general.

18:46.125 --> 18:47.835
Nothing in particular
that I'm happy for you for,

18:47.961 --> 18:49.503
just in general,
I'm happy for you.

18:50.922 --> 18:53.173
(sighs)

18:53.299 --> 18:54.008
You look really good.
Thanks.

18:54.133 --> 18:55.134
So do you.

18:55.259 --> 18:57.219
Really good.

18:58.930 --> 19:01.390
Liam, the press you
invited is here.

19:01.515 --> 19:04.477
Yeah. Right. Uh...

19:10.357 --> 19:11.567
There you go.
Okay.

19:11.692 --> 19:12.944
(laughs)

19:13.069 --> 19:14.946
Naomi! (squeals)

19:17.615 --> 19:19.117
Max says he'll be too busy,

19:19.241 --> 19:20.493
but I totally want to set you up
with someone at our wedding.

19:20.618 --> 19:21.995
He's super-rich and nice.

19:22.120 --> 19:23.370
And bald.

19:23.496 --> 19:25.581
Thank you for thinking
of me but...

19:25.706 --> 19:27.291
actually, something came up.

19:27.416 --> 19:29.877
I got a job offer in New York,

19:30.003 --> 19:32.964
opening Rachel Gray's office,
starting immediately.

19:33.089 --> 19:35.883
Oh, wait, are...

19:36.009 --> 19:37.844
you leaving?

19:37.969 --> 19:41.055
Yeah.
But that means you
won't be at our wedding.

19:41.180 --> 19:44.433
I know and I am super-sorry
to miss it,

19:44.558 --> 19:46.393
but I promise my fantastic
assistants

19:46.519 --> 19:49.438
will handle everything,
so, unless someone

19:49.563 --> 19:51.440
gives me another
reason to stay...

19:52.859 --> 19:55.444
I want to wish you guys
a very happy life together.

19:55.569 --> 19:57.071
Oh, my gosh!

19:57.196 --> 19:58.865
I'm so disappointed
for you to go!

19:58.990 --> 20:00.533
But I'm... I'm happy for you
at the same time.

20:00.658 --> 20:03.369
I'll miss you.

20:03.494 --> 20:05.079
What about you, Max?
Are you gonna miss me, too?

20:05.204 --> 20:08.541
Yeah, but it sounds like
a great opportunity.

20:09.792 --> 20:11.961
Yeah! Oh, yeah.
Yeah.

20:12.086 --> 20:14.380
I'm just,
I'm still sad to go.

20:14.505 --> 20:16.716
All the people that
I'm never gonna see again.

20:19.593 --> 20:20.678
Um, but I mean
there's not much,

20:20.803 --> 20:24.807
I guess, anyone can say
to change my mind.

20:24.932 --> 20:26.475
Well, then I guess
I'm happy for you.

20:28.936 --> 20:30.021
Cool. So...

20:30.146 --> 20:31.939
(anxious laugh)

20:32.065 --> 20:33.566
Bye.
Bye.

20:38.029 --> 20:38.863
Oh! Oh!

20:38.988 --> 20:41.615
(laughs)

20:41.741 --> 20:43.409
Car keys.

20:43.534 --> 20:44.535
Might need those.

20:47.621 --> 20:48.581
Hey, keep in touch.

21:00.134 --> 21:01.969
Is it time?

21:02.095 --> 21:05.305
No, I, uh...
I thought it would be better

21:05.431 --> 21:07.141
if you didn't know this,
but, uh...

21:07.266 --> 21:09.936
Dixon's been calling all day.

21:10.061 --> 21:11.812
Talking to Navid
made me realize

21:11.938 --> 21:14.607
you can't move on without
knowing the truth.

21:14.732 --> 21:16.442
So if you still feel
something for him,

21:16.567 --> 21:18.861
you should at least listen
to what he has to say.

21:18.986 --> 21:20.571
You owe that to yourself.

21:24.242 --> 21:26.326
ELECTRONIC VOICE:
You have three messages.

21:26.452 --> 21:28.662
To hear your messages,
Press 1.

21:28.788 --> 21:30.289
(beep)

21:30.414 --> 21:32.291
DIXON: Ade, hi.
It's me.

21:32.416 --> 21:34.585
I can't believe I left
without saying good-bye.

21:34.710 --> 21:36.545
I miss you.
Call me.

21:37.421 --> 21:39.132
(beep)

21:39.257 --> 21:40.133
Me again.

21:40.258 --> 21:41.717
I saw your song on YouTube.

21:41.842 --> 21:43.886
I deserve everything you said,
and I'm sorry.

21:44.011 --> 21:44.929
Look, I know it's probably
too late,

21:45.054 --> 21:45.888
but I want you back.

21:46.013 --> 21:48.557
(beep)

21:48.682 --> 21:50.893
Haley's people asked me
to stick with more of the tour,

21:51.018 --> 21:52.145
and they said I could
sing my own stuff,

21:52.270 --> 21:53.729
but listen, I don't care.

21:53.854 --> 21:55.940
None of this means anything
without you in my life.

21:56.065 --> 21:57.524
I'm coming home.

21:57.650 --> 22:00.069
Some guys are giving me
a ride tomorrow.

22:00.194 --> 22:02.905
They'll drop me off at the
Santa Monica Pier at 2:00.

22:03.030 --> 22:05.407
Meet me down there where we
rented those bikes.

22:05.532 --> 22:08.494
If you're there,
I'll know you still love me.

22:15.168 --> 22:17.170
Okay, so we got 400 signatures
from the rally

22:17.295 --> 22:18.879
and a couple hundred more
online. And I know it's not

22:19.005 --> 22:20.756
nearly enough still, but it's
better than nothing, right?

22:20.881 --> 22:22.758
Have you guys talked to
the senator yet?

22:22.883 --> 22:28.346
Yeah, um, Caleb spoke to the
Senator's Aid and he said

22:28.472 --> 22:33.019
my case isn't unique enough to
get the Senator's attention.

22:33.144 --> 22:34.812
Okay, well,
we're not giving up.

22:34.937 --> 22:37.190
Okay, I'll go to Sacramento
myself if I have to.
No.

22:37.315 --> 22:39.525
What do you mean, no?

22:39.650 --> 22:41.277
I called the lawyer
this morning.

22:41.401 --> 22:43.403
I'm going to turn myself in.

22:43.529 --> 22:44.947
You're going to...

22:45.072 --> 22:46.324
Diego, are you kidding me?!

22:46.448 --> 22:48.492
You can't do that.
Ivy, it's going to be okay.

22:48.617 --> 22:50.244
We knew this was
a long shot going in.

22:50.368 --> 22:51.537
Now, I don't want to be a
burden. All these people

22:51.662 --> 22:52.788
are trying to help me,
when in the end result,

22:52.913 --> 22:53.873
I'm just going to
get deported
anyway.

22:53.998 --> 22:56.167
You don't know that you're going
to get deported, Diego.

22:56.292 --> 22:58.544
You don't know that.
I do. I do. I've had friends
go down this road.

22:58.669 --> 23:00.338
And if I turn myself in now,

23:00.462 --> 23:03.049
it'll be a lot easier
for me to come back.
I can't lose you.

23:03.174 --> 23:04.591
I don't want to
lose you either.

23:04.717 --> 23:06.093
But what choice
do we have?

23:06.219 --> 23:08.386
Well...

23:08.512 --> 23:09.680
Look, I know it sounds
ridiculous,

23:09.805 --> 23:11.974
but you heard what the lawyer
said. We could get married.

23:12.099 --> 23:13.726
We're in a church, we could get
the priest to do it today.

23:13.851 --> 23:15.519
No, no, you got married
to Raj because

23:15.644 --> 23:17.395
he was in
a desperate situation.

23:17.521 --> 23:18.647
I'm not going to
let you do that again.

23:18.772 --> 23:20.358
Diego, that was completely
different. I'd marry you

23:20.482 --> 23:21.734
to keep you in the country.

23:21.859 --> 23:23.861
If we get married,
I want it to be because

23:23.986 --> 23:26.239
we know we want to spend the
rest of our lives together.

23:26.364 --> 23:27.865
SARA:
Whenever you're ready, Diego.

23:29.367 --> 23:31.618
Diego, please,
please don't do this.

23:31.744 --> 23:33.579
Ivy, it's going
to be okay.

23:37.457 --> 23:41.670
I hear Mexico City's got
a killer art scene, you know?

23:41.795 --> 23:43.964
And, um, I even know
a little Spanish.

23:44.090 --> 23:45.966
(sobbing)

23:46.092 --> 23:47.260
Te quiero.

23:47.385 --> 23:48.552
(sniffles)

24:18.874 --> 24:21.252
SILVER: Isn't it weird
to be at Max's wedding

24:21.377 --> 24:22.628
and he's not marrying Naomi?

24:22.753 --> 24:24.380
I'd always thought
they'd end up together.

24:24.504 --> 24:27.716
Yeah, me too.
Ah, no, thank you.

24:27.841 --> 24:30.010
Silver, we need to talk.

24:30.136 --> 24:32.596
Um, I know said you were only
thinking about the baby,

24:32.721 --> 24:35.433
but when I said
I was fine with that,

24:35.557 --> 24:36.642
I wasn't being
honest with you.

24:39.312 --> 24:42.606
I love you Silver.
And I want to be with you.

24:42.731 --> 24:45.109
And if we're going to do this,
I need to know

24:45.234 --> 24:46.693
you're in it
for the long haul,

24:46.819 --> 24:48.321
not just taking it
day by day.

24:48.446 --> 24:49.989
(big exhale)

24:50.114 --> 24:53.659
And I need to know
that you want to be with me.

24:53.784 --> 24:55.619
(sighs)

24:55.744 --> 24:57.413
Now I need a drink.

25:02.751 --> 25:04.837
I love weddings but I am

25:04.962 --> 25:08.215
wishing we could just
stay home and hang out together,

25:08.341 --> 25:10.968
just the two of us.

25:11.093 --> 25:12.678
Naked?
(chuckles)

25:12.803 --> 25:14.013
Hey, anyone in there?

25:14.138 --> 25:16.598
Sorry, I'm...

25:16.723 --> 25:20.686
I keep thinking about Diego.

25:20.811 --> 25:22.480
I feel like this
whole thing is my fault.

25:22.604 --> 25:25.024
Hey, we did everything
that we could.

25:25.149 --> 25:27.401
That's not true.

25:27.525 --> 25:30.528
I didn't pray for him.

25:30.654 --> 25:33.824
I know that it might
sound crazy, like,

25:33.949 --> 25:36.202
what difference would it make.

25:36.327 --> 25:38.620
But for the first time
in my life,

25:38.745 --> 25:41.457
I felt like
I couldn't pray.

25:41.581 --> 25:45.211
And what would I say?
"Hey, God, it's me again.

25:45.336 --> 25:48.839
I know I just turned my back on
you but do me a favor..."

25:48.964 --> 25:51.591
Well, I though that God wasn't
suppose to be vindictive.

25:51.717 --> 25:54.136
And I thought I was
suppose to be a priest.

25:54.261 --> 25:58.640
But now, I lost
my connection to Him.

26:00.017 --> 26:03.896
Anyway...

26:04.021 --> 26:06.190
(exhales)

26:06.315 --> 26:07.483
Hey...

26:09.609 --> 26:11.569
I'm really sorry. I don't think
I should go to this wedding.

26:11.695 --> 26:14.281
It's supposed to be
a day of celebration.

26:14.407 --> 26:16.075
I'm afraid I'll just
bring everybody down.

26:27.545 --> 26:28.795
Hey.
Hey.

26:28.921 --> 26:30.672
I, uh, heard about Diego.

26:30.797 --> 26:32.841
I didn't know if
you'd be here or not.

26:32.966 --> 26:34.676
Yeah, well, it was either
come to the wedding

26:34.801 --> 26:37.179
or sit home feeling sorry for
myself. So, I figured, why not?

26:37.304 --> 26:38.931
He called before
he flew out.

26:39.056 --> 26:41.141
They sure don't
waste any time, do they?

26:41.267 --> 26:43.810
Man, I'm sorry, Ivy.

26:43.936 --> 26:46.439
It sucks when you
can't be with the one you love.

26:46.564 --> 26:48.690
Tell me about it.

26:48.815 --> 26:51.151
Speaking of which, what's the
deal with you and Silver?

26:51.277 --> 26:52.736
Hm.

26:52.861 --> 26:53.862
There is no deal.

26:53.987 --> 26:56.949
I just...

26:59.910 --> 27:01.619
Man, I just want to
be with her so bad.

27:04.373 --> 27:05.832
But it doesn't really matter.

27:05.958 --> 27:07.709
I'm not what she needs.

27:07.834 --> 27:08.626
What are you talking about?

27:08.752 --> 27:10.546
I mean, you were the one who
was there for her

27:10.670 --> 27:12.423
when she was going through the
testing.

27:12.548 --> 27:14.049
And you were the one that she
opened up to about it.

27:14.174 --> 27:16.594
Yeah, but she wants
a baby. And I'm not

27:16.718 --> 27:19.054
ready for that. End of story.
You know what, I don't know
where you get the idea

27:19.179 --> 27:20.013
that you got to be
everything for everybody.

27:20.139 --> 27:21.723
But you don't.

27:21.848 --> 27:25.436
You do what you can do,
and sometimes it's...

27:25.561 --> 27:27.980
sometimes it's just about being
there for somebody, you know?

27:30.941 --> 27:33.193
I don't know how I didn't
think about this before.

27:33.319 --> 27:34.694
I got to go.

27:34.820 --> 27:35.946
Will you congratulate
Max for me?

27:36.071 --> 27:37.823
Yeah.

27:47.124 --> 27:50.294
(cell phone rings)
Dixon?

27:50.419 --> 27:51.462
Yo, it's me, your manager?

27:51.587 --> 27:53.713
You want to explain to me
where you are?

27:53.839 --> 27:55.757
Yeah, I'm at the pier
waiting for Dixon.

27:55.882 --> 27:58.760
You were right, I couldn't leave
without hearing him out.

27:58.885 --> 28:02.598
I kind of meant, you know,
listen to his messages, Ade.

28:02.722 --> 28:04.933
It's okay, just uh, you know,
do what you gotta do.

28:05.058 --> 28:07.353
And if you miss the flight,
I'll meet you in Vegas.

28:07.478 --> 28:08.562
(beep)

28:11.649 --> 28:13.233
Austin?

28:13.359 --> 28:14.985
Where's Ade?
Isn't she opening in Vegas

28:15.110 --> 28:16.736
for your hideous father?

28:16.862 --> 28:19.823
(sighs) She's at the pier,
waiting on Dixon.

28:19.948 --> 28:21.534
Oh.
Shouldn't you be
at Max's wedding?

28:21.659 --> 28:24.578
Actually, no, I got a great job
offer in New York.

28:24.702 --> 28:26.205
I'm going to be
working with Rachel.

28:26.330 --> 28:28.332
It's a wonderful opportunity.
I couldn't be happier.

28:28.457 --> 28:30.626
So, you're running away
from Max, huh?

28:30.750 --> 28:31.877
Um...

28:32.002 --> 28:34.380
Shouldn't you be shopping
for more cowboy hats?

28:34.505 --> 28:36.048
(chuckles)
I'm just saying,

28:36.173 --> 28:38.967
you know, I... I'm kinda
surprised he's marrying somebody
else.

28:39.092 --> 28:40.844
Sort of thought
you'd end up together.

28:40.969 --> 28:43.055
Yeah.

28:43.180 --> 28:46.141
Well, I sort of thought
we'd end up together too.

28:46.266 --> 28:49.061
For the first time in my life,
I can't have what I really want.

28:49.186 --> 28:52.356
I can't buy Max.
I can't seduce him

28:52.481 --> 28:55.275
and hoping he
was telling me that

28:55.401 --> 28:57.736
he wasn't sure if he was
making a mistake or not.

28:57.861 --> 28:59.821
I thought it was
because he loved me.

28:59.946 --> 29:01.907
And then it turned out
that he had just

29:02.032 --> 29:04.743
had a little too much to drink
at his bachelor party

29:04.868 --> 29:07.120
and doesn't even remember
talking to me at all.

29:07.246 --> 29:08.872
He loves Madison.

29:08.997 --> 29:10.332
Wait a minute,
(chuckles)

29:10.457 --> 29:12.167
go back to the part
about Max being drunk

29:12.292 --> 29:13.335
at the bachelor party.

29:13.460 --> 29:14.670
Oh, he's always been
a lightweight.

29:14.794 --> 29:16.505
He'd have half a beer
and he'd being doing

29:16.630 --> 29:19.717
tap dance moves from his
jazz class when he was a kid.

29:19.841 --> 29:23.303
Yeah, um, I was at that bachelor
party. Max wasn't drinking.

29:23.429 --> 29:25.514
What?

29:25.639 --> 29:27.433
Dude was stone cold sober.

29:27.558 --> 29:29.393
Why would he lie to me?

29:31.353 --> 29:33.606
Unless...

29:33.731 --> 29:35.608
Oh... oh, my,
oh, my God.

29:38.652 --> 29:40.696

Annie please remind me
why I thought a

29:54.918 --> 29:57.212
"no cell phone policy" at the
wedding was a good idea!

29:57.337 --> 29:59.632
Ah. (big exhale)

30:18.484 --> 30:21.779
Silver, wait,
we need to talk.

30:21.903 --> 30:23.071
I think we could be
great together.

30:23.196 --> 30:24.782
Liam.
No, no, let me finish.

30:24.906 --> 30:26.825
I let you walk away
because I thought

30:26.950 --> 30:28.368
I needed to be
everything for you.

30:28.494 --> 30:30.621
And the truth is,
