Gadzooks!

01:33.561 --> 01:36.261
The one hazard this balloon
cannot negotiate...

01:36.263 --> 01:38.163
a gentle breeze!

01:38.165 --> 01:38.764
(popping)

01:38.766 --> 01:41.567
Help! Curtail my ascent!
Curtail it, I say!

01:41.569 --> 01:43.302
Hey, Mr. Burns needs
our help!

01:43.304 --> 01:46.305
Let's just shoot at him
and see what happens.

01:46.307 --> 01:48.340
Good thing I went hunting
this morning.

01:48.342 --> 01:49.575
Bagged me an elk.

01:49.577 --> 01:50.876
Hey, where'd it go?

01:50.878 --> 01:51.677
(elk bellowing)

01:51.679 --> 01:55.314
Huh! I wonder
if that's the same elk.

01:57.184 --> 01:59.118
Oh, I can't do it.

01:59.120 --> 02:00.419
A balloon saved one
of my arteries.

02:00.421 --> 02:03.255
It doesn't seem right
to kill his cousin.

02:03.257 --> 02:04.923
Looks like it's up to me.

02:04.925 --> 02:07.593
Let's see, target
at two o'clock.

02:07.595 --> 02:09.194
Adjust for wind.

02:09.196 --> 02:09.862
Just shoot already.

02:09.864 --> 02:12.498
But I haven't finished
my rituals yet.

02:12.500 --> 02:13.732
Mwa!

02:13.734 --> 02:15.400
Mmm.

02:25.679 --> 02:28.180

02:33.254 --> 02:36.588
That's just sick.

02:36.590 --> 02:37.623
(all laughing)

02:37.625 --> 02:38.624
You stink!

02:38.626 --> 02:40.192
Nice shooting,
Annie Oakley!

02:40.194 --> 02:44.329
If you were a biathlete,
I'd say "stick to skiing."

02:56.610 --> 02:59.978
Simpson, your sharpened-shooting
has saved my life.

02:59.980 --> 03:01.480
Name your reward.

03:01.482 --> 03:03.515
Anything, just name it.

03:03.517 --> 03:05.817
All your money
and all your stuff.

03:05.819 --> 03:08.587
Lower and likelier.

03:08.589 --> 03:10.756
Uh, Super Bowl tickets?

03:10.758 --> 03:11.957
Playoff tickets?

03:11.959 --> 03:14.293
Regular season,
bobblehead day?

03:14.295 --> 03:16.161
Nothing-head day!

03:17.364 --> 03:19.965
Wow! I know I lay down
in front of bulldozers

03:19.967 --> 03:22.267
to stop this stadium
from being built,

03:22.269 --> 03:25.804
but I have to admit,
it's pretty sweet.

03:25.806 --> 03:27.272
It's so fancy:

03:27.274 --> 03:31.276
sushi bars, a 60-screen
movie theater,

03:31.278 --> 03:33.679
Museum of Tolerance.

03:34.882 --> 03:36.815
Oh, man.
Oh, geez.

03:36.817 --> 03:37.983
That made you think.

03:37.985 --> 03:39.651
They, even have
a day spa

03:39.653 --> 03:42.654
staffed by former
All-Pro linemen.

03:42.790 --> 03:44.356
You know, I wouldn't
have to do this

03:44.358 --> 03:48.827
if I hadn't bought
a Ferrari a day for 22 seasons.

03:48.829 --> 03:50.329
Flip over.

03:50.331 --> 03:51.697
I once hosted
<i>Saturday Night Live.</i>

03:51.699 --> 03:55.434
Once again, ladies and
gentlemen, Matchbox 20.

03:55.436 --> 03:56.335
Who dat?

03:56.337 --> 03:58.303
Ooh, they even have a zoo...

03:58.305 --> 04:01.807

the NFL mascots.

04:02.910 --> 04:05.577
(animals roaring, screeching)

04:06.413 --> 04:08.380
(dolphin chittering)

04:08.382 --> 04:11.750
This place even has
its own arts district

04:11.752 --> 04:14.753

intellectuals!

04:14.755 --> 04:19.625
We'll stay for one inning,
then we can go.

04:19.627 --> 04:21.493
Well, this has been great.

04:21.495 --> 04:24.429
We should get home soon--
the game's gonna be starting.

Oh, that's right!

04:29.670 --> 04:31.837
I hope you kids are enjoying
yourself today

04:31.839 --> 04:35.540
because you and your children
will be paying for this place

04:35.542 --> 04:38.377
long after the team moves
to another city.

04:38.379 --> 04:39.978
(audience cheering)

04:43.417 --> 04:45.417

05:16.750 --> 05:19.551
Eh. This song's
a little bossy for me.

05:19.553 --> 05:22.521
Aw, come on, sourpuss.

05:22.523 --> 05:23.922
Ticky, ticky,

05:29.763 --> 05:30.929
What does that mean?!

05:30.931 --> 05:32.597
Homie, maybe you
should stop.

05:32.599 --> 05:34.099
We've talked
about the gray zone.

05:34.101 --> 05:37.636
Marge, he's laughing.
That means he's happy.

05:37.638 --> 05:39.705
Has the Joker
taught you nothing?

05:39.707 --> 05:42.808
(playful grunting)
(giggling)
Quit it!

05:42.810 --> 05:43.742
(laughter)

05:43.744 --> 05:45.844
Knock it off!
Stop it!

05:45.846 --> 05:48.647
Dad, this isn't funny!

05:50.718 --> 05:54.686
The child has
wetted his trousers!

05:54.688 --> 05:58.090
(laughter)

05:59.426 --> 06:01.426
Dad, how could
you do that?

06:01.428 --> 06:04.162
The whole audience
saw me pee my pants!

06:04.164 --> 06:05.997
Son, I'm really,
really sorry.

06:05.999 --> 06:08.633
Oh, I don't know
if I can--

06:08.635 --> 06:09.701
whoo!--

06:09.703 --> 06:11.570
ever make it up to you.

06:11.572 --> 06:12.971
I-- whoo!--

06:12.973 --> 06:14.773
but I sincerely--

06:14.775 --> 06:15.540
whoo!

06:15.542 --> 06:18.744
Homer! Just because everyone
else is doing the wave

06:18.746 --> 06:20.746
doesn't mean
you have to.

06:20.748 --> 06:21.947
No one else
is doing it.

06:21.949 --> 06:23.515
I'm trying
to start it.

06:23.517 --> 06:24.983
Whoo!

06:24.985 --> 06:27.085
Whoo!

06:31.725 --> 06:35.460
Taking pity on the boy, the
operators of Springfield Stadium

06:35.462 --> 06:37.529
opened the stadium's
retractable roof

06:37.531 --> 06:39.398
in an attempt to dry his pants.

06:39.400 --> 06:40.732
Unfortunately,
the stain was picked up

06:40.734 --> 06:43.068
by Russian spy satellites,
and President Dmitry Medvedev

06:43.070 --> 06:46.104
has taken the pants-wetting
as a sign of American weakness.

06:46.106 --> 06:48.807
A Russian flotilla has just
entered New York harb...

06:48.809 --> 06:52.611
Oh. Bart's never
gonna forgive me
for humiliating him.

06:52.613 --> 06:54.012
And I wouldn't
blame him.

06:54.014 --> 06:56.581
You've destroyed our
son's self-esteem.

06:56.583 --> 06:57.883
Well, it was<i> your</i> idea

06:57.885 --> 07:00.018
to give him self-esteem
in the first place.

07:00.020 --> 07:01.653
MARGE:
I told you you should've
stopped the tickling.

07:01.655 --> 07:03.889
HOMER:
Now I have to work overtime
What?!

07:03.891 --> 07:05.891
just to counteract
the self-confidence...

07:05.893 --> 07:09.494
Hey Bart, I hear
the forecast is for showers...

07:09.496 --> 07:10.162
in your pants!

07:10.164 --> 07:12.030
I'm on a European
vacation,

07:12.032 --> 07:14.633
but "you're a-peein'"
everywhere!

07:14.635 --> 07:16.568
<i>Oui, oui!</i>

07:16.570 --> 07:18.737
(grunting)

07:18.739 --> 07:22.841
Oh. Why did I agree
to moderate this teleconference?

07:22.843 --> 07:24.910
You can't let this
go without using it

07:24.912 --> 07:28.246
as a chance
to improve your fathering.

07:28.248 --> 07:29.181
Well, of course,

07:29.183 --> 07:32.751
I would<i> love</i> to be
a more sensitive father.

07:32.753 --> 07:33.752
You know that.

07:33.754 --> 07:36.087
That's great!
Then you won't mind me

07:36.089 --> 07:38.557
enrolling you
in a fathering class.

07:38.559 --> 07:40.492
I'd like to see you
thumb through

07:40.494 --> 07:43.094
an extension school catalog
and find one.

07:43.096 --> 07:45.831
(shrieks)
Here's one right here.

07:45.833 --> 07:47.566
Please, Marge,<i> no.</i>

07:47.568 --> 07:50.168
The other negligent dads
will make fun of me.

07:50.170 --> 07:52.003
They're so cliquey.

07:52.005 --> 07:53.472
You'll be fine.

07:53.474 --> 07:54.206
You always are.

07:54.208 --> 07:58.710
Oh, I miss my friends
from drunk driving school.

07:58.712 --> 08:01.847
(sobbing)
They were so cool.

08:01.849 --> 08:04.049
(continues sobbing)

08:04.918 --> 08:07.519
(phone line ringing)

08:09.122 --> 08:11.022
Homer, welcome
to Fresh Start,

08:11.024 --> 08:13.225
a fathering
enrichment class.

08:13.227 --> 08:14.559
My name is Dr. Zander.

08:14.561 --> 08:17.229
Last week we assigned everyone
to keep a fathering journal.

08:17.231 --> 08:19.764
Gerald, would you like
to share your entries?

08:19.766 --> 08:21.032
Absolutely, Dr. Zander.

08:21.034 --> 08:24.669
"Monday: left work early
to see Derek's baseball game.

08:24.671 --> 08:26.905
"When Derek saw me
in the stands,

08:26.907 --> 08:29.274
"his smile was worth
a million dollars.

08:29.276 --> 08:31.543
"Tuesday:
Lost a million-dollar account

08:31.545 --> 08:33.778
because I left work
early Monday."

08:33.780 --> 08:36.481
That's great journaling.
Comments?

08:37.751 --> 08:38.884
Uh, Homer, it says here

08:38.886 --> 08:40.719
you've been a father
for ten years.

08:40.721 --> 08:43.188
What has that taught you?
Well, for one thing,

08:43.190 --> 08:45.957
you're never really
ready to be a father.

08:45.959 --> 08:46.958
But... oh, you know,

08:46.960 --> 08:49.227
the other day, Bart,
the little dickens,

08:49.229 --> 08:50.929
said I had an elephant butt.

08:50.931 --> 08:54.599
So anyway, I'm strangling him,
and I said to Bart...

08:54.601 --> 08:56.001
Wait. H-Hold on a moment.

08:56.003 --> 08:57.802
You were strangling your son?

08:57.804 --> 08:58.870
Yeah, strangling.

08:58.872 --> 09:00.338
I mean, it's not the<i> only</i> tool

09:00.340 --> 09:02.941
in my parenting toolbox,
but... (chuckles)

09:02.943 --> 09:04.175
it's the sharpest.

09:04.177 --> 09:05.544
(chuckling)

09:05.546 --> 09:06.811
Right?

09:06.813 --> 09:09.214
Anyway, I said "Bart..."

09:09.216 --> 09:10.582
You're actually serious?

09:10.584 --> 09:12.751
You physically lay your hands
on your boy's neck?

09:12.753 --> 09:17.055
Well, yeah, I... I guess
it's just how<i> I</i> was raised.

09:17.057 --> 09:18.590
Look at these grades!

09:18.592 --> 09:19.891
They're a disgrace!

09:19.893 --> 09:21.226
No TV for a week!

09:21.228 --> 09:22.827
Why, you little...

09:22.829 --> 09:25.730
(gagging,
grunting)

09:26.934 --> 09:32.737
So, are those butter cookies
for everybody, or...?

09:32.739 --> 09:35.807
Um... why don't we stop there
for today,

09:35.809 --> 09:37.709
and I'll see you next week.

09:37.711 --> 09:41.780
(whispering loudly):
Who do you have next period?

09:42.916 --> 09:45.016
(humming)

09:45.018 --> 09:45.784
Hey, Doc.

09:45.786 --> 09:47.719
(mouth full):
Where is everybody?

09:47.721 --> 09:48.820
I told them not to come.

09:48.822 --> 09:50.956
Why didn't you tell<i> me</i>
not to come?

09:50.958 --> 09:54.159
Homer, to emphasize the
seriousness of this situation,

09:54.161 --> 09:59.230
I'm going to turn my chair
around backwards.

09:59.232 --> 10:00.065
(screams)

10:00.067 --> 10:00.999
I feel...

10:01.001 --> 10:02.067
in this situation,

10:02.069 --> 10:05.770
the only option is a risky
and radical treatment.

10:05.772 --> 10:07.238
Homer, meet Kareem
Abdul-Jabbar.

10:07.240 --> 10:11.109
Dr. Zander and I play pick-up
basketball on the weekend.

10:11.111 --> 10:13.912
And when he told me
what you do to your son,

10:13.914 --> 10:18.149
I was so disturbed
I only scored 172 points.

10:18.151 --> 10:20.218
I had 86 assists.

10:20.220 --> 10:24.589
But today he's here
to<i> assist</i> me with you.

10:26.393 --> 10:28.693
Hey, what...
wh-what are you doing?

10:28.695 --> 10:31.096
Homer, it's time you understood
what it feels like

10:31.098 --> 10:34.232
to be young,
small and terrified.

10:35.135 --> 10:36.301
No, Doc, please.

10:36.303 --> 10:38.136
I'm just a little boy.

10:38.138 --> 10:39.170
Why, you little...

10:39.172 --> 10:41.439
(Homer grunting, choking)

10:41.441 --> 10:44.743
(grunting,
choking continue)
I don't want to hurt him, Doc.

10:44.745 --> 10:45.977
You have a good
heart, Kareem.

10:45.979 --> 10:50.749
Which is why you're
the only Laker I could
trust with this task.

10:50.751 --> 10:51.950
(grunting,
choking)

10:51.952 --> 10:55.086
Uh, not a good time
to water the plants?

10:55.088 --> 10:55.987
No, it's fine.

10:55.989 --> 10:58.123
(grunting,
choking)
Hey, Kareem,

10:58.125 --> 11:01.292
what do you think
about today's selfish players?

11:01.294 --> 11:02.894
(gagging)

11:02.896 --> 11:04.763
Ball-hogging,
tattooed...

11:04.765 --> 11:07.999
♪ No more Mr. Nice Guy ♪

11:08.001 --> 11:12.037
♪ No more Mr. Cle-e-e-ean ♪

11:12.039 --> 11:14.706
♪ No more Mr. Nice Guy ♪

11:14.708 --> 11:19.744
♪ They say, he sick,
he's obsce-e-e-ene. ♪

11:19.746 --> 11:22.013
♪ ♪

11:26.453 --> 11:28.053
(gagging)

11:28.055 --> 11:32.257
Dr. Zander, you made me see
my life through Bart's neck,

11:32.259 --> 11:36.961
and I swear, I will never,
ever strangle my boy again.

11:36.963 --> 11:39.397
I believe we've made
excellent progress here today,

11:39.399 --> 11:40.965
and after another few years

11:40.967 --> 11:42.333
of twice-weekly sessions,
we can really...

11:42.335 --> 11:46.771
Um, I, uh, lied about having
health insurance.

11:46.773 --> 11:49.207
And you're cured.

11:54.314 --> 11:56.181
Hello, boy.
Homer.

11:56.183 --> 11:58.083
I want you to know I'm cured.

11:58.085 --> 11:59.718
Good for you.
No more drinking?

11:59.720 --> 12:02.053
(chuckling): Oh, son.
I can't quit drinking

12:02.055 --> 12:05.323
any more than I could quit being
a man.

12:05.325 --> 12:06.224
Oh.

12:06.226 --> 12:07.392
Now it feels like morning.

12:07.394 --> 12:11.162
What I am cured of is the
blind rage that has soured

12:11.164 --> 12:13.898
our otherwise storybook
relationship.

12:13.900 --> 12:16.267
Go ahead, just
try to provoke me.

12:16.269 --> 12:18.837
(sighs)
I just got up, man.

12:18.839 --> 12:22.207
Oh, come on. Bust
your daddy's chops.

12:22.209 --> 12:24.709
(sighs)
Fine.

12:25.812 --> 12:26.811
(angry grunts)

12:26.813 --> 12:28.279
Why, you little...!

12:28.281 --> 12:29.514
I'll teach you to...

12:29.516 --> 12:30.982
I'm in your head, man.

12:30.984 --> 12:31.382
(screams)

12:31.384 --> 12:34.486
Why, you... (grunts)
I'm gonna... (grunts)

12:34.488 --> 12:36.387
Maybe this time...

12:36.389 --> 12:37.822
(grunts, groans)

12:37.824 --> 12:39.257
(pained grunts)

12:39.259 --> 12:43.762
Aw. My son's
first stroke.

12:43.764 --> 12:44.796
Say...

12:44.798 --> 12:48.233
(slurring):
"Cheese."

12:48.235 --> 12:50.502
Can't hurt the boy.
Can't hurt the boy.

12:50.504 --> 12:52.504
(yells)
What the ...?!

12:52.506 --> 12:54.205
Boy, get down
from there.

12:54.207 --> 12:57.075
Okay.
First, I'll send down my shoes.

12:57.077 --> 12:58.309
All right.
(screams)

12:58.311 --> 13:00.745
Why, you little...!

13:02.115 --> 13:04.549
Oh, come on.
Now you're a tree?

13:04.551 --> 13:06.284
(gagging)

13:07.287 --> 13:08.353
(sobbing)

13:08.355 --> 13:10.855
(laughing mischievously)

13:12.192 --> 13:14.392
(whistling)

13:16.563 --> 13:19.497
(panicked shouts)

13:19.499 --> 13:20.865
Bart Simpson.

13:20.867 --> 13:23.168
What would your father say
if he knew what you were doing?

13:23.170 --> 13:28.139
He'd say, "I'm a grown man
who's scared of my own son."

13:28.141 --> 13:30.208
I find that hard to believe.

13:30.210 --> 13:32.243
Oh, yeah? Look.

13:33.847 --> 13:35.213
How many more, sir?

13:35.215 --> 13:37.916
Fill the board,
then wash my car.

13:37.918 --> 13:40.051
These are my keys.

13:40.053 --> 13:41.152
What was that?

13:41.154 --> 13:42.053
I-I said,

13:42.055 --> 13:46.257
"My keister is ready
for a whooping, sir."

13:46.259 --> 13:48.026
(sighs)

13:53.466 --> 13:55.867
(Willie grunts)

13:57.504 --> 14:00.138
(Chief Wiggum groans)

14:03.076 --> 14:05.176
No. No. I'm just a kid.

14:05.178 --> 14:07.145
Leave me alone.

14:08.348 --> 14:11.216
BART:
It's "A-B-C,
one, two, three!"

14:11.218 --> 14:13.051
It's the easiest
song in the world!

14:13.053 --> 14:14.819
(Homer sobbing)

14:16.523 --> 14:19.991
You think you're better
than the Great Simpsini?

14:19.993 --> 14:21.459
(grunting)
Well, you're not.

14:21.461 --> 14:23.661
What are you gonna do,
write a book about me?

14:23.663 --> 14:26.531
(grunts)
You couldn't get
in the door of Random House

14:26.533 --> 14:29.234
if your name was
Bennett Cerf III.

14:29.236 --> 14:30.268
(grunts)

14:30.270 --> 14:32.203
One, two, three, cry.
(grunts)

14:32.205 --> 14:34.205
One, two, three, cry.
(grunts)

14:34.207 --> 14:36.908
How is that water?
Wet like your tears?

14:36.910 --> 14:39.010
(grunting)

14:40.480 --> 14:42.447
Precious, is that you?

14:42.449 --> 14:43.381
Yes, Mama.

14:43.383 --> 14:44.616
You think you're so pretty.

14:44.618 --> 14:46.484
Where's my lotto ticket?

14:46.486 --> 14:48.353
I forgot, Mama.

14:49.055 --> 14:49.954
(screams)

14:49.956 --> 14:52.590
And don't you come back
without it!

14:52.592 --> 14:54.659
You hear me?!

14:54.661 --> 14:56.327
Hurry up!

14:56.329 --> 14:58.863
(whimpers, panting)

15:00.400 --> 15:02.934
(Homer cries out)

15:04.304 --> 15:06.537
I don't see
many more movie roles

15:06.539 --> 15:07.672
for a girl like you.

15:07.674 --> 15:12.243
Not unless George Lucas
needs another Death Star.

15:12.245 --> 15:15.580
No! Stop!
No<i> Star Wars</i> parodies!

15:15.582 --> 15:17.048
Homer! Homer!

15:17.050 --> 15:18.549
Oh! What?!

15:18.551 --> 15:19.284
(panting)

15:19.286 --> 15:22.654
The school called and said
Bart is out of control.

15:22.656 --> 15:25.423
I think we may need some therapy
for him.

15:25.425 --> 15:26.224
Oh, that's ridiculous.

15:26.226 --> 15:30.595
How could two people from
the same family need therapy?

15:30.597 --> 15:32.330
Hmm.

15:32.332 --> 15:35.366
(wind whistling)

15:38.972 --> 15:40.238
Dr. Zander?

15:40.240 --> 15:42.006
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar?

15:42.008 --> 15:43.274
Anyone?

15:43.276 --> 15:44.976
Hmm.

15:46.413 --> 15:49.147
Hmm. Hmm.

15:50.383 --> 15:54.519
Dr. Zander,
what happened?

15:54.521 --> 15:55.586
Oh, it's the damn economy.

15:55.588 --> 15:57.255
When it went south,
the first thing

15:57.257 --> 16:00.191
people stopped spending money on
was expensive therapists.

16:00.193 --> 16:01.459
So, we all live here now,

16:01.461 --> 16:04.529
along with the other
unemployed luxury professionals:

16:04.531 --> 16:07.332
wedding planners,
personal shoppers,

16:07.334 --> 16:09.300
aromatherapists,

16:09.302 --> 16:11.035
high-end caterers.

16:11.037 --> 16:11.769
Mushroom cap?

16:11.771 --> 16:13.504
Those are pieces
of broken glass.

16:13.506 --> 16:15.206
Well, I'll pass that on
to the chef.

16:15.208 --> 16:18.443
I'll also pass on pieces
of your face to my monkeys.

16:18.445 --> 16:20.378
Look, now my son
needs your help.

16:20.380 --> 16:22.013
How much you got on you?

16:22.015 --> 16:23.448
Uh... $23.

16:23.450 --> 16:26.617
And there's a can
of beans in my car.

16:26.619 --> 16:27.318
Ugh!

16:27.320 --> 16:30.088
After a PhD,
lectures on cruises,

16:30.090 --> 16:34.425
monthly column
in<i> Springfield Magazine...</i>

16:34.427 --> 16:37.228
Are there franks in the beans?

16:37.764 --> 16:39.030
(grunting)

16:39.032 --> 16:42.700
So whatever you did to my
husband, it was too effective.

16:42.702 --> 16:46.504
Mm, mm, yes. One of the most
common complaints about therapy.

16:46.506 --> 16:49.207
And now my son is a bully.
Can you fix him?

16:49.209 --> 16:52.510
Probably, but we should
discuss it in your car.

16:52.512 --> 16:54.746
The sommeliers
are coming.

16:54.748 --> 16:56.547
Buttery finish.

16:56.549 --> 16:57.515
Great year
for Zin.

16:57.517 --> 17:01.352
This is what<i> I</i> drink
at home.
(Marge yelps)

17:04.791 --> 17:07.759
Homer, Bart, this
weekend in the wilderness

17:07.761 --> 17:12.063
should repair the shattered
bond between the two of you.

17:12.065 --> 17:15.500
I find
that in a natural setting...

17:15.502 --> 17:16.801
(rattling)

17:16.803 --> 17:18.636
(laughs)
(whimpering)

17:18.638 --> 17:20.505
Very funny, Bart.

17:20.507 --> 17:23.641
That's not the
snake, is it?

17:23.643 --> 17:25.276
Sorry, little friend.

17:25.278 --> 17:28.179
Slither back to
your natural element.

17:29.149 --> 17:31.082
(whimpering)

17:31.084 --> 17:32.350
Now, Bart, I want you

17:32.352 --> 17:35.119
to guide your father
safely through these cacti.

17:35.121 --> 17:36.220
Then what do we win?

17:36.222 --> 17:38.156
A better relationship.

17:38.158 --> 17:39.190
(groans)
Oh!

17:39.192 --> 17:41.225
Okay, go
straight.
(yells)

17:41.227 --> 17:43.327
Three steps right.
(whimpering)

17:43.329 --> 17:44.796
Two to the left.
(shrieks)

17:44.798 --> 17:46.230
Now Bart, you
do understand

17:46.232 --> 17:48.199
you're supposed
to<i> avoid</i> the cacti.

17:48.201 --> 17:49.834
Sure do. I'm just
bad at counting.

17:49.836 --> 17:52.370
Two to the right.
(shrieks)

17:52.372 --> 17:53.604
Backwards one.
Oh! (gasping)

17:53.606 --> 17:55.840
Diagonal two.
(yells)

17:55.842 --> 17:57.508
Now do-se-do.

17:57.510 --> 17:59.210
(Homer screams rhythmically)

17:59.212 --> 18:01.446
While your father
and brother

18:01.448 --> 18:04.148
are doing some manly
bonding in the woods,

18:04.150 --> 18:06.884
I thought we could do
a little bonding of our own.

18:06.886 --> 18:10.755
We'll do each other's nails,
make some brownie sundaes

18:10.757 --> 18:15.259
and watch the four saddest
horse movies I could find.

18:15.261 --> 18:16.527
<i>Broken-Leg Beauty,</i>

18:16.529 --> 18:19.430
<i>Sorry, Silver,</i>
<i>No More Mint Juleps.</i>

18:19.432 --> 18:24.435
And the fourth one has a title
so sad I can't even say it.

18:24.437 --> 18:26.637
Really? Can I see it?

18:26.639 --> 18:29.240
(sobbing)

18:32.412 --> 18:34.312
GIRL (on TV):
Oh, Beauty,

18:34.314 --> 18:36.514
I don't need money or parents

18:36.516 --> 18:38.816
<i>or</i> eyesight when I've got you.

18:38.818 --> 18:40.118
(whinnying)

18:40.120 --> 18:41.819
(music swells)

18:41.821 --> 18:42.487
(gasps)

18:42.489 --> 18:45.490
Oh, I always forget
about this part.

18:45.492 --> 18:48.292
(sniffles, cries)

18:50.563 --> 18:51.529
Oh. I don't know.

18:51.531 --> 18:54.832
There's something
about this noose I
just don't like.

18:54.834 --> 18:57.502
Homer, desperate times call
for desperate measures.

18:57.504 --> 18:59.403
If you hop down from that limb,

18:59.405 --> 19:02.673
I assure you,
Bart<i> will</i> cut you down.

19:02.675 --> 19:04.242
I don't know.

19:04.244 --> 19:07.311
Keep your neck inside
the rope at all times!

19:07.313 --> 19:09.247
(sighs)

19:09.249 --> 19:10.882
(choking)

19:10.884 --> 19:12.850
Well? Anything?!

19:12.852 --> 19:14.485
Can't look. Texting.

19:14.487 --> 19:16.654
(cell phone chiming)
Ooh, a text.

19:16.656 --> 19:19.724
Let's see. Text message
for I.M.A. Wiener.

19:19.726 --> 19:22.827
As you all can see,
I.M.A. Wiener.

19:22.829 --> 19:24.262
(laughter)

19:24.264 --> 19:26.230
I see it, Moe.

19:26.232 --> 19:27.832
Why you! When I...

19:27.834 --> 19:32.904
When...I... get ahold...
of you, I...

19:32.906 --> 19:35.940
Oh, damn it,
I typed an "F" and not a "D."

19:35.942 --> 19:38.209
Uh... Delete. Delete.
Delete. Delete.

19:38.211 --> 19:41.512
Oh, crap,
I just donated $20 to Haiti!

19:41.514 --> 19:43.414
(laughing)

19:45.351 --> 19:46.717
Bart, I'm trying
to get you

19:46.719 --> 19:47.985
to feel something
for your father!

19:47.987 --> 19:49.520
I feel something for him.

19:49.522 --> 19:51.789
Here it comes. (burps)

19:51.791 --> 19:52.924
Why you little...?!

19:52.926 --> 19:54.525
(grunting)
(choking)

19:54.527 --> 19:55.927
Oh, this is a
tough neck!

19:55.929 --> 19:57.795
Oh, it's so strong!

19:57.797 --> 19:58.930
Like an oak.

19:58.932 --> 20:01.532
You see? You see how that
boy pushes your buttons?

20:01.534 --> 20:03.000
We'll talk
when he's dead!

20:03.002 --> 20:04.735
(grunting)
(choking)

20:04.737 --> 20:06.837
Just break already!

20:06.839 --> 20:09.173
(choking)

20:13.413 --> 20:14.879
(sighs)

20:14.881 --> 20:15.980
Thanks, Dad.

20:15.982 --> 20:18.216
Son, you and I are gonna be
closer than ever

20:18.218 --> 20:22.853
as we spend the rest of
our lives suing that therapist.
