as soon as I get to L.A.

01:19.496 --> 01:22.248

photographing those baby pandas.

So how excited are you to sing
"The Boy Next Door" on Dad's morning show?

01:38.306 --> 01:40.517
To be honest, I'm totally freaking out.

01:40.600 --> 01:42.977
Perhaps I should have performed
in public at least once

01:43.061 --> 01:45.021
before I sing live on national TV.

01:45.647 --> 01:48.942
Well, the way I see it,
this could go one of two ways.

01:49.025 --> 01:52.821
This could either make your dream of
becoming a singer/songwriter come true,

01:52.904 --> 01:55.657
or... the opposite.

01:58.368 --> 02:01.204
You mean, it could end my music career
before it even starts?

02:01.287 --> 02:03.706
Well, I was trying to
leave it vague, but...

02:03.790 --> 02:04.666
yeah.

02:06.251 --> 02:09.587
Well, what about you? Are you psyched
for your first weekend away with Matt?

02:10.171 --> 02:11.548
I'm a little nervous.

02:11.631 --> 02:16.261
Matt and I have only been dating a month

Well, the way I see it,
this could go one of two ways.

02:20.807 --> 02:23.935

of a beautiful life together.

02:24.310 --> 02:25.562
Or the opposite.

02:27.814 --> 02:31.151
You mean, it could end our relationship

always have an entourage.

telling them how great they are.

-Ooh, someone tell me how great I am.
-You're great.

10:57.365 --> 10:59.492

'cause you're in my entourage.

and say "Busted!"

11:27.144 --> 11:29.230
All right, great. OK, let's go.

11:34.777 --> 11:35.653

11:35.736 --> 11:37.988
Oh, come on, let me see this.

11:38.072 --> 11:39.240
It's not locked.

11:44.245 --> 11:45.413
It appears to be locked.

11:47.289 --> 11:50.126
Why is a real lock on a fake jail?

11:50.209 --> 11:53.045
Oh, because Police Mom
is incredibly accurate.

11:53.129 --> 11:54.755
The stapler really staples.

11:56.340 --> 11:58.092
All right. Everybody, just stay calm.

11:58.175 --> 12:01.387

is to sort of take charge

It's really none of your business
so stop asking me questions.

12:34.628 --> 12:36.797
Becky is still not here.
You know what this means?

12:36.881 --> 12:39.925
Yes! I can finally host the show
by myself.

12:40.009 --> 12:40.968
No, you can't.

12:41.886 --> 12:42.928
You need a co-host.

12:43.012 --> 12:45.723
And you're going to choose one
from the audience with bingo balls.

12:47.641 --> 12:49.393
I... I... I don't think
that's a good idea.

12:49.477 --> 12:51.103
I... I... I really don't care.

12:52.730 --> 12:55.399
You're on in five, four, three...

12:55.483 --> 12:57.610
[Wake Up USA theme tune, clapping]

12:57.693 --> 13:00.112
Wake up, USA, I'm Danny Tanner.

13:01.280 --> 13:05.034
And as you can see, my co-host Rebecca
is not here right now,

13:05.117 --> 13:06.702
but you know who is?

13:06.785 --> 13:07.828
Me!

13:07.912 --> 13:08.746
Danny Tanner!

13:09.580 --> 13:11.373
And I'm the guy who's never missed a show,

13:11.457 --> 13:13.626
even when I had pink eye for a whole week.

13:14.543 --> 13:17.755
I want to thank of all you for your
concerned tweets, it meant a lot.

13:18.714 --> 13:21.300
Anyhoo, my producer thinks
that I need a co-host

13:21.383 --> 13:26.680
because he says
that I drone on and on and on and on...

13:26.764 --> 13:28.933
But I think this is going very well.

13:29.725 --> 13:31.060
Extremely well.

13:31.852 --> 13:32.686
Well.

13:33.938 --> 13:35.189
Well, well, well.

13:35.898 --> 13:36.941
OK, I need a co-host.

13:38.025 --> 13:39.276
Oh, look, my balls are here.

13:40.778 --> 13:46.075
OK, so what I'm gonna do now
is I'm gonna pick a co-host,

13:46.158 --> 13:48.869
a lucky person
from the audience at random,

13:48.953 --> 13:49.787
right now.

13:50.412 --> 13:51.830
-Here we go...
-23.

13:51.914 --> 13:53.207
25.

13:58.087 --> 14:00.548
It's me! It's me!

14:00.631 --> 14:02.132
I'm 25!

14:03.968 --> 14:05.886
Kimmy Gibbler, come on down!

14:12.768 --> 14:14.979
Oh, no, no, no. No, no... [stammers]

14:16.105 --> 14:18.148
This is not good, this is not good at all.

14:18.232 --> 14:20.860
I'd like to spin again,
would you please bring my balls back?

14:22.695 --> 14:23.863
Too late for that.

14:23.946 --> 14:27.116
Hello, I'm your co-host Kimmy Gibbler.

14:27.199 --> 14:28.826
Good morning, America!

14:30.160 --> 14:31.370
Wrong show.

14:32.580 --> 14:34.540
Folks, small world story.

14:34.623 --> 14:37.376
I grew up in the house next door
to this string bean.

14:39.336 --> 14:41.046
My bedroom looked right into his,

14:41.130 --> 14:44.383
so I can tell you anything you wanna know
and plenty you don't.

14:44.466 --> 14:45.968
[cell rings]

14:46.051 --> 14:47.469
Let's take our first caller.

14:48.095 --> 14:50.055
We don't take calls here.

14:50.139 --> 14:51.515
Then why is my phone ringing?

14:53.058 --> 14:55.686
Gibbler Style Party Planning.
Who wants to party?

14:56.687 --> 14:58.397
-Hi!
-This is live TV.

14:58.939 --> 15:01.400
And this is the Gottlieb Bar Mitzvah.

15:01.483 --> 15:03.569
-Yes, I know.
-All right, give me the phone.

15:04.111 --> 15:07.156
Hello, Mr. Gottlieb, shalom.
Danny Tanner here.

15:08.365 --> 15:11.827
Yeah, I'm sorry this is not a good time,
but honestly, mazel tov.

15:13.537 --> 15:15.539
You know what? Let's check the weather.

15:15.623 --> 15:19.960
Well, my phone says it's 73
in Los Angeles and, hang on...

15:21.545 --> 15:23.213
Hah! I caught a Pokemon!

15:27.927 --> 15:29.011
[sighs]

15:29.094 --> 15:30.804
Isn't this fun, Reej?

15:32.389 --> 15:34.224
Once again, wrong show.

15:37.978 --> 15:42.483
I'm sorry Matt. I know this isn't
the romantic weekend we had planned.

15:42.566 --> 15:45.945
What could be more romantic than wiping
sweat off a middle-aged man's forehead?

15:47.863 --> 15:51.992
I can't help thinking I'm partly
to blame for everybody being sick.

15:52.076 --> 15:54.036
You're not partly to blame.

15:54.119 --> 15:55.913
You're entirely to blame.

15:57.748 --> 16:00.960
Hey, we don't know for sure
if we got sick because of my donuts.

16:01.043 --> 16:03.545
DJ ate one and she feels fine.

16:04.296 --> 16:06.215
Yeah, it's true, I feel great.

16:06.882 --> 16:10.219
Hey, since we're all home,
let's watch Stephanie on Dad's show.

16:10.302 --> 16:13.514
Danny, did you know this is
National Hotdog Awareness month?

16:13.597 --> 16:16.517
So all month long, everyone's a weiner.

16:16.600 --> 16:17.768
[laughs]

16:17.851 --> 16:19.520
I must be hallucinating.

16:19.603 --> 16:21.939
That looks like Mom hosting Wake Up USA.

16:22.773 --> 16:25.526
Becky, if you can hear this,
please come back.

16:27.569 --> 16:30.072
Hey, guys, donut update.

16:30.823 --> 16:31.991
It was all Joey's fault.

16:34.159 --> 16:36.453
-Deej, are you OK?
-Do not follow me.

16:39.206 --> 16:40.791
No luck calling for help.

16:40.874 --> 16:43.794
You would think a cell
would have cell service.

16:45.629 --> 16:47.923
I'm behind bars with no bars!

16:50.134 --> 16:51.969
This is rich with irony.

16:53.512 --> 16:56.557
In 30 years, I have never missed a show.

16:56.640 --> 16:58.600
My career means everything to me.

16:58.684 --> 17:02.438
Yes, but nothing compared to being
the world's greatest mom, right honey?

17:04.481 --> 17:05.566
Oh, yeah, that too.

17:06.650 --> 17:10.154
You see, Mrs. Lopez, we love being parents

17:10.237 --> 17:13.657
and we love babies and we just
can't wait to start our new family.

17:13.741 --> 17:16.869
Hey, what's that behind your...
Oh, look at this, it's a 100 dollar bill.

17:18.370 --> 17:21.123
You guys, I'm missing my big break.

17:21.707 --> 17:24.793
You know, maybe this is the universe
telling me that this isn't meant to be.

17:24.877 --> 17:27.379
Or maybe this knucklehead
locked you in a fake jail.

17:30.382 --> 17:32.259
I probably would've blown it anyway.

17:32.968 --> 17:34.595
Steph, where is this coming from?

17:35.137 --> 17:37.890
If it doesn't happen today, it will.
You know why?

17:38.390 --> 17:39.433
You're talented.

17:40.059 --> 17:40.893
-Really?
-Yes.

17:40.976 --> 17:43.395
And I should know,
I've known you your whole life.

17:43.479 --> 17:45.355
In fact, I was there when you were born.

17:47.524 --> 17:49.068
Who taught you how to sing?

17:49.151 --> 17:51.111
-You.
-Who taught you how to play guitar?

17:51.862 --> 17:53.822
-You.
-Who taught you how to ride a bike?

17:54.865 --> 17:55.741
Dad.

17:57.117 --> 17:59.078
Who taught you how to pop a wheelie?

17:59.411 --> 18:02.039
And I know I taught you
to believe in yourself.

18:02.122 --> 18:03.040
You can do this.

18:04.083 --> 18:04.917
Yeah.

18:05.626 --> 18:06.460
You're right.

18:06.543 --> 18:07.628
I can do this.

18:08.337 --> 18:09.463
Thanks Uncle Jesse.

18:12.800 --> 18:16.845
Wow, my papa never said
anything like that to me.

18:16.929 --> 18:19.139
If only he had supported me.

18:19.223 --> 18:21.475
I could have been a synchronized swimmer.

18:23.644 --> 18:27.022
Mrs. Lopez, you can still be
a synchronized swimmer.

18:27.106 --> 18:28.482
I believe in you.

18:28.565 --> 18:30.692
In fact, I see you
in one of those bathing caps

18:30.776 --> 18:33.612
and a sexy Baywatch bathing suit.

18:33.695 --> 18:35.072
[giggles]

18:35.155 --> 18:36.990
You're so inspiring!

18:37.074 --> 18:38.617
I'm gonna learn how to swim.

18:40.619 --> 18:42.037
Bring it in, Little Mermaid.

18:42.121 --> 18:43.205
[giggles]

18:45.207 --> 18:46.834
Does that mean we get our baby now?

18:46.917 --> 18:51.046
Well, I can't make any promises,
but I'll put in a good word for you.

18:51.797 --> 18:52.631
Thank you.

18:52.714 --> 18:57.010
And if we do get a baby, boy or girl,
we'll name it Mrs. Lopez.

18:59.972 --> 19:02.599
All right. There has got to be
a way out of here.

19:02.683 --> 19:04.518
Oh! I got it!

19:04.893 --> 19:07.729
I was captain of my cheerleading squad,
back in 19... [mutters]

19:09.606 --> 19:11.483
We can build a human pyramid.

19:11.984 --> 19:14.194
[chants] Ready? OK.

19:14.278 --> 19:15.362
Push 'em back!

19:15.445 --> 19:16.280
Push 'em back!

19:16.363 --> 19:17.990
Way back!

19:18.073 --> 19:19.491
Go, Beavers!

19:24.538 --> 19:26.248
God, you are so hot.

19:27.749 --> 19:30.127
All right, people,
Fernando, you're right here...

19:30.210 --> 19:33.172
-OK.
-Mrs. Lopez, right next to Fernando.

19:33.255 --> 19:35.215
-Yeah, OK.
-Let me get these off.

19:35.299 --> 19:38.969
Steph, all we need you to do,
is get up there... Ready?

19:39.052 --> 19:40.012
Hold on...

19:40.095 --> 19:41.930
-Ready?
-Ow!

19:42.014 --> 19:43.599
-Here we go.
-Sorry.

19:43.682 --> 19:45.058
-Careful.
-One more.

19:45.142 --> 19:47.269
-All right, Steph.
-One more foot...

19:47.811 --> 19:48.896
There you go.

19:48.979 --> 19:51.440
OK, push, push... Go, go, go...

19:53.025 --> 19:55.194
[overlapping chatter]

20:09.041 --> 20:10.125
Swing your foot...

20:10.209 --> 20:13.921
All right everybody,
smile for the cell-fie.

20:16.089 --> 20:19.635
Excuse me, we're trying
to get out of here... Oh...

20:22.179 --> 20:23.972
We can make it to the show, come on!

20:24.056 --> 20:25.933
-Hustle, people, hustle, let's go!
-Hey!

20:26.016 --> 20:27.017
A little help here?

20:30.562 --> 20:32.356
How we doing here
in the girls' ward?

20:32.439 --> 20:35.234
[both whine and groan]

20:37.402 --> 20:39.696
Huh, looks like I made it
to wine country after all.

20:41.448 --> 20:42.991
[bell rings]

20:43.492 --> 20:46.078
[Joey] Nurse Matt? I need you.

20:47.246 --> 20:48.956
Why did I give Joey a bell?

20:49.873 --> 20:51.458
[bell rings again]

20:56.797 --> 20:58.674
How may I help you this time, Joey?

20:58.757 --> 21:01.176
[baby voice] My pillow needs fluffing.

21:03.804 --> 21:05.305
Pwease?

21:06.807 --> 21:07.891
Of course.

21:08.308 --> 21:09.142
OK.

21:10.143 --> 21:11.561
There you go, little fella.

21:12.437 --> 21:15.232
Oh! Who gave you a bell?

21:15.315 --> 21:18.819
Oh, I did.
A baby with a bell is really funny.

21:21.363 --> 21:22.990
What's the matter, little guy?

21:24.241 --> 21:25.909
-[Tommy gurgles]
-Oh.

21:25.993 --> 21:27.661
You wanna be with your big bros.

21:28.203 --> 21:30.163
All right, come on, scoot over, boys.

21:31.915 --> 21:33.417
Plenty of room for all of us.

21:35.085 --> 21:36.336
Oh, and Cosmo, huh?

21:41.508 --> 21:44.511
Don't you worry, I'm here for you.

21:45.095 --> 21:46.471
Thanks for taking care of us.

21:47.180 --> 21:49.850
Please don't leave until we feel better.

21:51.727 --> 21:55.063
Hey, I feel vewwy vewwy weft out.

21:56.773 --> 21:57.816
Wing.

21:58.567 --> 21:59.526
Wing, wing.

22:00.027 --> 22:01.236
Wing, wing, wing...

22:04.531 --> 22:08.368
So if you've got some potato chips,
a packet of taco spice

22:08.452 --> 22:11.079
and some meat,
or meat substitute,

22:12.456 --> 22:15.208
then you've got yourself
some Gibbler Goulash.

22:16.293 --> 22:17.377
Here, taste it, Mr. T.

22:17.461 --> 22:21.965
No, thanks. It looks terrible,
it smells terrible and... Ugh...

22:23.300 --> 22:24.718
Oh, wow.

22:25.177 --> 22:26.428
Surprisingly good.

22:26.928 --> 22:27.763
No.

22:27.846 --> 22:29.264
Exceptionally horrible.

22:31.975 --> 22:35.187
I'll have you know, Great Grandpa
Gibbler ate this every day of his life,

22:35.270 --> 22:38.732
breakfast, lunch and dinner
and he lived to be almost 40.

22:39.524 --> 22:42.027
You know what, Gibbler?
I have had enough.

22:42.110 --> 22:44.529
You hijacked my weather,
my cooking segment,

22:45.197 --> 22:48.200
and I know you convinced
that capuchin monkey to hump my leg.

22:49.576 --> 22:51.703
Oh, come on, the audience loved it.

22:51.787 --> 22:53.163
And so did the monkey.

22:55.707 --> 22:57.250
Hey, everybody, sorry I'm late.

22:57.334 --> 22:58.418
Becky's back!

23:00.295 --> 23:01.380
Oh, Becky!

23:02.214 --> 23:06.176
Becky, if I have ever taken you
for granted, I am so sorry.

23:07.761 --> 23:09.471
-Becky's back!
-Oh. [chuckles]

23:09.554 --> 23:11.056
I missed you so much.

23:11.139 --> 23:13.266
Oh, Danny, our musical guest has arrived.

23:13.350 --> 23:15.185
Oh. Ah.

23:15.685 --> 23:17.479
Oh, oh, no, my curlers...

23:17.562 --> 23:18.563
You're on. You're on.

23:19.314 --> 23:20.148
Here.

23:20.232 --> 23:23.151
I'm very proud to introduce
my daughter singing her hit song

23:23.235 --> 23:26.947
from the viral video,
starring my grandson and my grand-dog.

23:27.030 --> 23:28.532
No nepotism here.

23:29.574 --> 23:31.409
Let's give it up for Stephanie Tanner!

23:31.493 --> 23:34.788
Music video produced and directed
by Gibbler Style Party Planning!

23:38.333 --> 23:40.418
-♪ Used to think--♪
-Sadly we're out of time.

23:40.502 --> 23:42.629
Sorry, that's our show.
I'm Danny Tanner.

23:42.712 --> 23:44.506
I'm Rebecca Donaldson-Katsopolis.

23:44.589 --> 23:46.633
And of course, I'm Kimmy Gibbler.

23:47.634 --> 23:49.886
And take a little time to enjoy the view.

23:51.346 --> 23:53.515
For the last time, wrong show.

23:54.766 --> 23:55.684
[sighs]

23:58.103 --> 23:59.437
And we are out!

23:59.938 --> 24:01.022
Of show business.

24:02.274 --> 24:03.984
Well, there goes my music career.

24:04.067 --> 24:05.610
You'll get another shot. Watch this.

24:05.694 --> 24:07.904
Danny, can she have
another shot on the show next week?

24:07.988 --> 24:09.447
-Sure.
-See how easy that was?

24:10.365 --> 24:12.159
Aw, thanks, Dad!

24:12.242 --> 24:14.202
You're welcome, sweetie.

24:14.286 --> 24:17.330
Now, if you'll all excuse me,
I've got to get this monkey off my leg.

24:19.249 --> 24:20.417
Walter, in the future,

24:20.500 --> 24:23.879
let's try to keep our relationship
strictly professional, OK?

24:28.341 --> 24:30.468
I'm sorry we missed our trip.

24:30.969 --> 24:33.096
Don't be. I had a great time today.

24:33.180 --> 24:36.933
I know you guys didn't, but I kind of
felt like I was part of the family.

24:37.017 --> 24:39.769
You did a fantastic job
of taking care of us.

24:40.270 --> 24:41.897
Those boys of yours are great.

24:42.480 --> 24:43.607
Even that little Joey.

24:45.400 --> 24:47.194
He's still mad you took his bell away.

24:49.070 --> 24:50.322
Can I have a kiss goodbye?

24:51.281 --> 24:54.367
-You've brushed your teeth, right?
-Yes, I did.

24:54.451 --> 24:57.454
[live audience] Ooh!

24:57.954 --> 24:59.789
You know what, I heard it that time too.

25:01.917 --> 25:06.213
Out of our way,
Hollywood's newest star has returned.

25:07.422 --> 25:08.632
Thank you.

25:08.715 --> 25:10.467
Thank you.

25:10.550 --> 25:13.762
DJ, let's do lunch.
My people will call your people.

25:14.721 --> 25:16.139
Fernando, call DJ's people.

25:17.766 --> 25:19.142
Speaking of celebrities,

25:19.226 --> 25:24.564
my Instagram from the Police Mom jail
just passed 400,000 likes.

25:24.648 --> 25:27.025
How many followers do you have?

25:27.108 --> 25:28.235
Two and a half million.

25:28.944 --> 25:31.780
You people keep forgetting
I'm a famous race car driver.

25:34.658 --> 25:37.577
Oh, man, I feel so much better.

25:37.661 --> 25:39.663
I slept all day. [laughs]

25:39.746 --> 25:41.706
I lost four pounds.

25:42.916 --> 25:45.252
Anytime you need a babysitter,
just let me know.

25:45.335 --> 25:48.046
I'll bring you back
some day-old airport sushi.

25:48.129 --> 25:49.422
[evil laugh]

25:58.974 --> 26:00.267
Thanks for the help, Kimmy.

26:00.850 --> 26:02.727
Thank you. Those go to the Gibbler suite.

26:04.980 --> 26:06.982
Hey, Deej, why aren't you in Napa?

26:07.065 --> 26:09.859
Oh, we all got donut poisoning.

26:10.193 --> 26:12.529
But Matt took really good care
of me and the kids.

26:13.405 --> 26:14.698
The boys really love him.

26:16.116 --> 26:17.993
Why do you sound like that's a bad thing?

26:18.076 --> 26:19.869
Oh, no, it's not.

26:19.953 --> 26:23.748
It's just... the boys are getting
really attached to him.

26:24.582 --> 26:26.751
And what if things
don't work out between us?

26:27.377 --> 26:29.045
I don't want to see them get hurt.

26:29.129 --> 26:32.757
Deej, the kids will be fine
no matter what happens,

26:32.841 --> 26:35.176
just like we were
when dad started dating again.

26:36.636 --> 26:39.180
Yeah, I guess
we didn't care who dad dated,

26:39.264 --> 26:40.932
we just wanted him to be happy.

26:41.725 --> 26:43.560
And that's what your boys want for you.

26:44.227 --> 26:45.520
Yeah, and so do we.

26:45.895 --> 26:47.731
Whatever you need, we're here for you.

26:47.814 --> 26:48.982
Aww...

26:51.526 --> 26:52.360
Good.

26:52.444 --> 26:55.071
Because I'm gonna need help
cleaning the bathrooms.

26:56.698 --> 26:58.074
And the back yard.

26:59.909 --> 27:02.787
Oh. No, I meant we were
here for you emotionally.

27:04.664 --> 27:07.167
Lucky me, I got the last donut.

27:10.128 --> 27:12.088
Let's hold off on the cleaning.

27:15.633 --> 27:17.385
[Stephanie] No, I'm fine, thank you.
