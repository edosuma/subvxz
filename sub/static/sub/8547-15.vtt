they were beaten to a pulp.

05:41.654 --> 05:42.932
That feels personal.

05:42.935 --> 05:44.597
It's possible the unsub
knew both victims,

05:44.599 --> 05:47.989
or at the very least used them as
surrogates for the true object of his anger.

05:47.991 --> 05:49.909

and disposes of each victim

05:49.911 --> 05:51.477

a secure secondary location

In fact, the lacerations
were done postmortem.

09:43.352 --> 09:45.142

is a symbolic way

09:45.143 --> 09:46.421

have hesitated.

09:51.127 --> 09:53.365

10:11.256 --> 10:13.302

his method of torture.

10:15.479 --> 10:16.406
Or he's devolving.

10:16.408 --> 10:17.685
Maybe the torture
isn't enough.

10:17.687 --> 10:20.598
There could be something
else he wants from his victims.

what caused the rift

When our folks split,
she took it the hardest.

10:40.600 --> 10:43.286

had gotten married in Vegas.

11:01.559 --> 11:04.725

the two of them, she came back here.

she was promiscuous.

head over heels for any man

11:24.056 --> 11:25.782
who showed her the slightest
amount of attention.

11:25.784 --> 11:27.477
That may rule out
the lonely hearts theory.

11:27.479 --> 11:29.493
That type of unsub typically
thrives off of challenge.

11:29.495 --> 11:31.221

You know what? There might be another

13:38.903 --> 13:40.853
Well, it makes him
easier to control.

13:40.855 --> 13:42.741
He prolongs the torture
because the more he does,

13:42.743 --> 13:44.405
the more powerful
he feels.

13:44.407 --> 13:48.181
Which could mean he doesn't
feel very important in his everyday life.

of dominance

13:56.375 --> 13:57.909
is to target
other submissives.

If this is about
power and control,

13:59.415 --> 14:01.781

the unsub didn't have any?

16:39.016 --> 16:40.997

a projecting punisher,

in the home.

Rather than viewing
his mother as a victim,

towards her

another purpose.

Honey, ginger tea, and saltwater
are often used to treat sore throats.

Maybe something about
their voices is what's driving him.

19:37.512 --> 19:40.262
But a sadist wouldn't
go to such lengths to heal his victims.

Oh, uh, just gloves.

37:06.481 --> 37:09.840
In a pink bag?
Those are not gloves.

37:09.841 --> 37:12.686
So, uh, what's up
with these boys from your class?

37:12.689 --> 37:13.615
They're running late.

37:13.617 --> 37:14.959
Ahh.

37:14.961 --> 37:16.367
Ok, well,

37:16.369 --> 37:17.712
don't miss your curfew.

37:17.713 --> 37:20.175
I won't.
don't you trust me?

37:20.177 --> 37:21.968
Yeah, I trust you.
It's the boys I don't trust.

37:21.969 --> 37:24.463
Ok. Well, I'm gonna
leave you guys to it.

37:24.465 --> 37:26.543
Uh, just remember,
boys that run late

37:26.545 --> 37:28.047
are not worth waiting for.

37:28.049 --> 37:29.327
Bye.
Bye, Chris.

37:29.329 --> 37:30.575
Bye, Mr. Callahan.

37:30.577 --> 37:32.047
Bye, you guys.

37:32.049 --> 37:34.800
I can't believe it.
Your Uncle's a total stalker.

37:34.801 --> 37:36.495
Right? I don't know why
he can't just accept

37:36.497 --> 37:39.983
that I'm not a little
girl anymore. Jeez.

37:39.985 --> 37:41.167
Hey, sweetie, it's me.

37:41.169 --> 37:43.631
I, uh--look, I just want
to clear the air

37:43.633 --> 37:45.775
and let you know
that I'm really sorry.

37:45.777 --> 37:48.015
We definitely should have
discussed Meg dating

37:48.017 --> 37:50.768
before I gave the approval
for her to do that. And...

37:50.769 --> 37:53.167
But if it's any consolation,
I'm at the mall right now,

37:53.169 --> 37:56.559
and I'm planning on sticking around
to keep an eye on them.

37:56.561 --> 37:58.031
But, uh, they're doing great.

37:58.033 --> 38:01.167
Except for the fact they may have just
been stood up for the first time.

38:01.169 --> 38:02.479
But...[Laughs]

38:02.481 --> 38:04.879
I, uh, I love you,
and I do feel bad.

38:04.881 --> 38:08.656
So bad, as a matter of fact, that
I bought you something amazing.

38:08.657 --> 38:12.239
It's like, red, and it's got
black stripes,

38:12.241 --> 38:13.487
and a strap.

38:13.489 --> 38:16.239
It's gonna look
so hot on you.

38:16.241 --> 38:19.760
Uh, I'll show you
when you get home, ok?

38:26.737 --> 38:28.207
Where are they?

38:28.209 --> 38:29.871
I don't know.

38:33.777 --> 38:35.855
Sorry.

38:51.441 --> 38:53.359
Oh, they're not coming.

38:53.361 --> 38:55.087
What? Why not?

38:55.089 --> 38:58.511
I don't want
to talk about it.
