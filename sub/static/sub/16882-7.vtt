WEBVTT

00:02.236 --> 00:04.505
*

00:06.740 --> 00:07.841
>> EDGAR: Gretchen, will you

00:07.875 --> 00:09.043
please pass the syrup to your

00:09.077 --> 00:09.977
boyfriend?

00:10.010 --> 00:10.644
>> GRETCHEN: Ugh!

00:10.678 --> 00:11.545
>> JIMMY: We're eating!

00:11.579 --> 00:12.246
>> EDGAR: What?

00:12.280 --> 00:13.181
You're boyfriend-girlfriend now,

00:13.214 --> 00:13.814
right?

00:13.847 --> 00:14.848
>> GRETCHEN: Sounds so high

00:14.882 --> 00:15.549
school.

00:15.583 --> 00:16.384
>> EDGAR: Then what do you call

00:16.417 --> 00:17.851
each other? Your honey?

00:17.885 --> 00:18.852
Your boo?

00:18.886 --> 00:19.753
Your companion?

00:19.787 --> 00:20.988
>> JIMMY: What are we, gay

00:21.021 --> 00:21.755
lovers from the '80s?

00:21.789 --> 00:22.923
>> GRETCHEN: We're not calling

00:22.956 --> 00:23.824
each other anything.

00:23.857 --> 00:25.326
We just made a verbal agreement

00:25.359 --> 00:26.727
not to sleep with other people.

00:26.760 --> 00:27.661
For now.

00:27.695 --> 00:28.562
>> JIMMY: In a week, we could

00:28.596 --> 00:29.497
remember that monogamy is a

00:29.530 --> 00:30.998
social construct free of

00:31.031 --> 00:31.832
biological necessity.

00:31.865 --> 00:32.733
>> GRETCHEN: Or we could be

00:32.766 --> 00:33.934
invited to a really fun sex

00:33.967 --> 00:35.002
party.

00:35.035 --> 00:35.769
Oh...

00:35.803 --> 00:39.940
Remember group sex, Jimmy?

00:39.973 --> 00:42.009
Jimmy?

00:42.042 --> 00:43.077
Remember group sex?

00:43.111 --> 00:43.644
Jimmy?

00:43.677 --> 00:44.445
>> JIMMY: Actually, I've

00:44.478 --> 00:45.446
never...

00:45.479 --> 00:46.280
>> GRETCHEN: What?!

00:46.314 --> 00:47.215
Not even a standard threesome?

00:47.248 --> 00:47.915
>> EDGAR: Oh, Jimmy.

00:47.948 --> 00:48.949
>> JIMMY: You've had a

00:48.982 --> 00:49.617
threesome?

00:49.650 --> 00:50.684
>> EDGAR: I'm an adult male in

00:50.718 --> 00:52.420
my 30s, so, yeah.

00:52.453 --> 00:54.255
(Gretchen and Edgar giggle)

00:54.288 --> 00:56.290
Anyway, uh, Lindsay and I wanted

00:56.324 --> 00:58.259
to celebrate y'all making it

00:58.292 --> 01:00.594
official, so I made a dinner

01:00.628 --> 01:04.565
reservation for four at 8:00.

01:04.598 --> 01:07.368
Oh, hey, I almost forgot.

01:07.401 --> 01:09.103
This package came for you.

01:09.137 --> 01:11.605
>> JIMMY: Hmm.

01:31.091 --> 01:33.561
(door opens, closes)

01:33.594 --> 01:35.829
>> EDGAR: That was weird.

01:35.863 --> 01:37.565
I guess I should go give him one

01:37.598 --> 01:40.134
of my famous Edgar Quintero pep

01:40.168 --> 01:42.470
talks.

01:42.503 --> 01:44.472
Wait.

01:44.505 --> 01:46.140
Ha!

01:46.174 --> 01:47.575
That's your job now.

01:47.608 --> 01:48.476
>> GRETCHEN: What?

01:48.509 --> 01:49.410
Ew. Why?

01:49.443 --> 01:50.411
>> EDGAR: Because you're his

01:50.444 --> 01:51.445
lady.

01:51.479 --> 01:52.913
Behind every great man there's

01:52.946 --> 01:54.248
a great woman.

01:54.282 --> 01:56.250
Or, you know, someone like you.

01:56.284 --> 01:56.884
Go.

01:56.917 --> 01:58.152
I think it's time you got to

01:58.186 --> 02:00.154
know the real Jimmy.

02:00.188 --> 02:02.356
>> GRETCHEN: Do I have to?

02:02.390 --> 02:03.357
>> EDGAR: Mm-hmm.

02:03.391 --> 02:05.626
(Gretchen whimpers)

02:19.407 --> 02:22.476
>> * I'm gonna leave you anyway

02:22.510 --> 02:24.512
I'm gonna leave you anyway

02:24.545 --> 02:27.315
Gonna leave you anyway. *

02:40.528 --> 02:42.129
>> JIMMY: Yes!

02:42.162 --> 02:43.197
(clears throat)

02:43.231 --> 02:45.333
You've sold out of my book.

02:45.366 --> 02:46.534
Just goes to show that with

02:46.567 --> 02:48.302
patience and strong word of

02:48.336 --> 02:50.404
mouth, true literature...

02:50.438 --> 02:51.339
>> MANAGER: You've been

02:51.372 --> 02:52.306
remaindered, Jimmy.

02:52.340 --> 02:53.207
Your books are probably being

02:53.241 --> 02:54.141
turned into hamster bedding

02:54.174 --> 02:54.675
right now.

02:54.708 --> 02:55.676
>> JIMMY: What?!

02:55.709 --> 02:57.010
Well, that seems premature.

02:57.044 --> 02:58.011
>> MANAGER: Well, if we suddenly

02:58.045 --> 02:59.012
get a big rush for it, we can

02:59.046 --> 03:00.514
always send people to the dollar

03:00.548 --> 03:01.482
bin at Costco.

03:01.515 --> 03:02.550
>> JIMMY: Oh, you would buy your

03:02.583 --> 03:03.584
food in bulk.

03:03.617 --> 03:05.219
Is that the lesbian from

03:05.253 --> 03:06.320
Roseanne?

03:06.354 --> 03:07.521
>> MANAGER: Yeah.

03:07.555 --> 03:08.689
Unlike you, she wrote a book

03:08.722 --> 03:10.358
that's selling actual copies.

03:10.391 --> 03:11.659
>> JIMMY: Oh, of course she did.

03:11.692 --> 03:13.594
Did they give Darlene a book?

03:13.627 --> 03:16.997
Let's give Becky Two a book!

03:17.030 --> 03:18.432
I look forward to your Married

03:18.466 --> 03:21.702
with Children cast poetry slam.

03:24.472 --> 03:25.239
>> GRETCHEN: Dana from work

03:25.273 --> 03:26.106
liked my 'gram of the baby

03:26.139 --> 03:27.375
sneaker in the gutter.

03:27.408 --> 03:28.609
>> JIMMY: And her Internet

03:28.642 --> 03:30.444
approval is meaningful

03:30.478 --> 03:31.345
because...?

03:31.379 --> 03:32.380
>> GRETCHEN: I like her and I

03:32.413 --> 03:33.381
don't have a lot of female

03:33.414 --> 03:34.382
friends.

03:34.415 --> 03:35.283
I think women are intimidated by

03:35.316 --> 03:36.950
me because I have mean cartoon

03:36.984 --> 03:38.519
eyebrows.

03:38.552 --> 03:40.688
>> JIMMY: Ah.

03:40.721 --> 03:43.457
>> GRETCHEN: So, uh...

03:43.491 --> 03:45.359
What's new?

03:45.393 --> 03:47.060
Listen, if something is

03:47.094 --> 03:49.029
bothering you and you want to

03:49.062 --> 03:51.932
talk about it, I will listen.

03:51.965 --> 03:53.367
Or if you just want to pretend

03:53.401 --> 03:54.435
that nothing happened, that's

03:54.468 --> 03:55.736
totally fine, too.

03:55.769 --> 03:56.937
>> JIMMY: It was a package from

03:56.970 --> 03:58.406
my dad.

03:58.439 --> 03:59.707
Manchester jersey.

03:59.740 --> 04:01.074
I don't even like sports--

04:01.108 --> 04:03.544
especially Manchester, the team

04:03.577 --> 04:05.713
that ruined every Saturday of my

04:05.746 --> 04:07.615
entire childhood.

04:07.648 --> 04:09.483
Also, I sent him a copy of my

04:09.517 --> 04:12.620
book, like, months ago.

04:12.653 --> 04:16.390
He didn't say anything about it.

04:16.424 --> 04:18.392
Instead, he sends me Gareth

04:18.426 --> 04:21.495
Henderson gear.

04:21.529 --> 04:22.330
>> GRETCHEN: Well, great.

04:22.363 --> 04:23.897
I'm glad you got that off your

04:23.931 --> 04:25.232
chest.

04:25.265 --> 04:25.999
Look!

04:26.033 --> 04:28.502
Lena Dunham's dog got a haircut.

04:28.536 --> 04:29.337
>> JIMMY: I mean, does he think

04:29.370 --> 04:30.771
that after, what, 30-odd years

04:30.804 --> 04:32.573
on this planet, I'm magically

04:32.606 --> 04:34.241
going to start sharing his

04:34.274 --> 04:35.409
interests in...

04:35.443 --> 04:37.077
>> EDGAR: Uh, still waiting for

04:37.110 --> 04:39.447
our friends.

04:41.715 --> 04:43.517
How are you?

04:43.551 --> 04:44.518
>> LINDSAY: No one ever asks me

04:44.552 --> 04:45.753
that!

04:45.786 --> 04:48.756
But since you did, I cheated on

04:48.789 --> 04:50.524
my husband with a 19-year-old

04:50.558 --> 04:51.625
named Aiden.

04:51.659 --> 04:53.661
>> EDGAR: Wow.

04:53.694 --> 04:55.095
Do you feel guilty?

04:55.128 --> 04:57.097
>> LINDSAY: Ooh, good question.

04:57.130 --> 04:59.533
Honestly, I kind of feel like

04:59.567 --> 05:01.335
two different people right now.

05:01.369 --> 05:03.136
There's Wife Lindsay who helps

05:03.170 --> 05:04.872
Paul with gravestone rubbings on

05:04.905 --> 05:06.774
his genealogy trips.

05:06.807 --> 05:08.376
And then there's Adulteress

05:08.409 --> 05:09.610
Lindsay who just wants to sit on

05:09.643 --> 05:11.612
everyone's face.

05:11.645 --> 05:12.780
>> EDGAR: Sometimes I feel like

05:12.813 --> 05:14.682
there's Veteran Edgar and

05:14.715 --> 05:15.616
Regular Edgar.

05:15.649 --> 05:16.550
>> LINDSAY: So feeling like this

05:16.584 --> 05:17.385
is normal?

05:17.418 --> 05:18.452
>> EDGAR: Maybe.

05:18.486 --> 05:19.687
Although, I do have a traumatic

05:19.720 --> 05:20.621
brain injury.

05:20.654 --> 05:21.522
>> LINDSAY: Me, too!

05:21.555 --> 05:22.222
>> EDGAR: Huh?

05:22.255 --> 05:23.056
>> LINDSAY: One time I was at a

05:23.090 --> 05:24.157
rave, and I stared at a strobe

05:24.191 --> 05:25.359
light so long I forgot how to

05:25.393 --> 05:26.894
whistle.

05:26.927 --> 05:28.396
What'd you do today?

05:28.429 --> 05:29.697
>> EDGAR: Nothing.

05:29.730 --> 05:30.631
>> LINDSAY: Oh, my God!

05:30.664 --> 05:31.732
Me, too!

05:31.765 --> 05:32.700
>> EDGAR: With Gretchen around,

05:32.733 --> 05:33.834
I don't have much to do for

05:33.867 --> 05:34.968
Jimmy anymore.

05:35.002 --> 05:36.704
I feel this is, like, a new

05:36.737 --> 05:38.071
chapter in my friendship with

05:38.105 --> 05:38.906
him.

05:38.939 --> 05:41.709
Hey, this is nice.

05:41.742 --> 05:43.143
I can't remember the last time

05:43.176 --> 05:44.478
Jimmy asked me a question about

05:44.512 --> 05:45.178
myself.

05:45.212 --> 05:46.079
>> LINDSAY: I've been trying to

05:46.113 --> 05:47.381
talk to Gretchen about Aiden for

05:47.415 --> 05:48.181
days.

05:48.215 --> 05:49.583
>> EDGAR: We should just ignore

05:49.617 --> 05:51.351
them tonight until they ask

05:51.385 --> 05:52.185
about us.

05:52.219 --> 05:54.488
>> LINDSAY: Ooh, I love that.

05:54.522 --> 05:55.989
Like an experiment, but without

05:56.023 --> 05:57.491
the boring science part, like

05:57.525 --> 05:58.659
milligrams and elements and

05:58.692 --> 05:59.560
shit.

05:59.593 --> 06:02.730
>> EDGAR (chuckling): Great!

06:02.763 --> 06:04.197
>> LINDSAY: They're not showing

06:04.231 --> 06:04.998
up, are they?

06:05.032 --> 06:07.435
>> EDGAR: I don't think so, no.

06:07.468 --> 06:08.736
>> JIMMY: I wrote a novel, and

06:08.769 --> 06:10.103
still there's no response from

06:10.137 --> 06:10.938
him.

06:10.971 --> 06:12.740
He's barely literate, so who

06:12.773 --> 06:15.075
knows if he could even read it?

06:15.108 --> 06:16.844
But if he did manage to sound it

06:16.877 --> 06:18.946
out, it'd just be nice to hear

06:18.979 --> 06:20.748
that he was proud of me.

06:20.781 --> 06:22.916
You know?

06:27.721 --> 06:28.689
Are you listening to me?

06:28.722 --> 06:29.690
>> GRETCHEN: What?

06:29.723 --> 06:30.958
Of course.

06:30.991 --> 06:32.426
I just, I listen better when I

06:32.460 --> 06:33.694
have something to do with my

06:33.727 --> 06:34.762
hands.

06:34.795 --> 06:36.697
>> JIMMY: Okay.

06:36.730 --> 06:37.765
That bikini top doesn't have

06:37.798 --> 06:38.766
straps.

06:38.799 --> 06:40.233
>> GRETCHEN: Oh, good call.

06:40.267 --> 06:41.435
My eyes always go straight to

06:41.469 --> 06:43.571
the bush.

06:50.077 --> 06:51.044
>> GRETCHEN: I know it's, like,

06:51.078 --> 06:51.979
my "job" to be there for him,

06:52.012 --> 06:53.113
but at one point, I thought he

06:53.146 --> 06:54.314
was gonna cry, and I was like,

06:54.347 --> 06:55.215
"This is it.

06:55.248 --> 06:56.216
I'm never going to be able to

06:56.249 --> 06:57.250
have sex with him again."

06:57.284 --> 06:58.586
I just don't think I'm equipped

06:58.619 --> 06:59.653
to handle this part of a

06:59.687 --> 07:00.588
relationship.

07:00.621 --> 07:02.456
I will sample the Aztec Vanilla.

07:02.490 --> 07:03.657
>> WALLACE: It's do-it-

07:03.691 --> 07:04.725
yourself now.

07:04.758 --> 07:06.159
One sample cup per customer.

07:06.193 --> 07:08.161
So I bet you guys feel pretty...

07:08.195 --> 07:09.463
>> LINDSAY: I know what you mean

07:09.497 --> 07:10.263
about emotions.

07:10.297 --> 07:11.665
Ever since I cheated on Paul,

07:11.699 --> 07:12.933
I've been feeling hella guilty.

07:12.966 --> 07:13.834
>> WALLACE: You can't reuse the

07:13.867 --> 07:15.235
sample cups.

07:15.268 --> 07:16.336
>> LINDSAY: Part of me thinks

07:16.369 --> 07:17.605
I should just tell Paul.

07:17.638 --> 07:18.606
What do you think?

07:18.639 --> 07:19.673
>> WALLACE: It's like you guys

07:19.707 --> 07:21.274
willfully don't even hear me.

07:21.308 --> 07:22.409
>> LINDSAY: I could just take

07:22.442 --> 07:23.677
this one to the grave.

07:23.711 --> 07:25.813
Like Titanic said, a woman's

07:25.846 --> 07:28.348
heart is an ocean of secrets.

07:28.381 --> 07:30.350
Right?

07:30.383 --> 07:31.685
Hello?

07:31.719 --> 07:33.487
Are you even listening to me?

07:33.521 --> 07:34.522
>> GRETCHEN: Yes, totally.

07:34.555 --> 07:35.523
I just listen better when I have

07:35.556 --> 07:36.690
something to do with my mouth.

07:36.724 --> 07:37.625
>> LINDSAY: So, what do you

07:37.658 --> 07:38.692
think I should do?

07:38.726 --> 07:39.627
>> GRETCHEN: Honestly, Linds,

07:39.660 --> 07:40.694
I wasn't gonna say anything, but

07:40.728 --> 07:41.862
I can't take it anymore.

07:41.895 --> 07:43.631
First, you get these new

07:43.664 --> 07:44.832
Berkin-toting Westside friends

07:44.865 --> 07:45.999
with fake teeth and even

07:46.033 --> 07:46.967
faker tits.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.870
And then the minute I get a...

07:49.903 --> 07:51.038
>> LINDSAY: Boyfriend.

07:51.071 --> 07:51.972
>> GRETCHEN: Ugh!

07:52.005 --> 07:52.973
As soon as Jimmy and I

07:53.006 --> 07:54.041
become a thing, you go out

07:54.074 --> 07:55.609
and start taking dicks.

07:55.643 --> 07:57.210
Can you imagine how abandoned

07:57.244 --> 07:58.178
I feel?

07:58.211 --> 07:59.780
>> LINDSAY: I'm sorry, Gretchen.

07:59.813 --> 08:01.649
Wait, why am I apologizing to

08:01.682 --> 08:02.716
you?

08:02.750 --> 08:03.884
You stood me up last night.

08:03.917 --> 08:05.385
>> DANA: Hey, bitch!

08:05.418 --> 08:06.654
>> GRETCHEN: Hi.

08:06.687 --> 08:07.721
>> DANA: Ready to go back to

08:07.755 --> 08:08.656
work?

08:08.689 --> 08:10.190
>> LINDSAY: Um, who is this?

08:10.223 --> 08:11.491
>> GRETCHEN: This is my work

08:11.525 --> 08:12.526
wife, Dana.

08:12.560 --> 08:13.794
>> DANA: Hi.

08:13.827 --> 08:14.962
>> LINDSAY: You're work-married?

08:14.995 --> 08:15.963
>> DANA: Come on, wifey.

08:15.996 --> 08:17.631
There is ice cream cake in the

08:17.665 --> 08:18.532
office kitchen.

08:18.566 --> 08:19.633
>> GRETCHEN: Cake?

08:19.667 --> 08:20.634
Eat a dick, yogurt.

08:20.668 --> 08:21.802
Bye, Linds.

08:21.835 --> 08:24.004
>> DANA: Bye!

08:25.739 --> 08:26.874
>> WALLACE: Ma'am, could you not

08:26.907 --> 08:28.308
do that?

08:28.341 --> 08:29.810
Can you just buy something?

08:29.843 --> 08:30.878
>> LINDSAY: I can't believe they

08:30.911 --> 08:32.546
flaked again.

08:32.580 --> 08:33.547
Why are they treating us

08:33.581 --> 08:35.916
like this?

08:35.949 --> 08:38.318
>> EDGAR: Lindsay, I think we're

08:38.351 --> 08:39.687
sidekicks.

08:39.720 --> 08:41.822
>> LINDSAY: Ew, I am not

08:41.855 --> 08:43.691
a sidekick.

08:43.724 --> 08:45.693
I'm Beyoncé, not Kelly Rowland.

08:45.726 --> 08:47.027
If I'm on a motorcycle, I'm

08:47.060 --> 08:48.228
driving the motorcycle, not

08:48.261 --> 08:49.930
riding in that shitty little

08:49.963 --> 08:51.699
side motorcycle thingie for poor

08:51.732 --> 08:53.667
people and dogs.

08:53.701 --> 08:54.768
>> EDGAR: Think about it.

08:54.802 --> 08:55.936
In your relationship with

08:55.969 --> 08:58.005
Gretchen, are you the Mary Tyler

08:58.038 --> 09:00.040
Moore or the Rhoda?

09:00.073 --> 09:01.241
>> LINDSAY: Who are those

09:01.274 --> 09:02.576
people?

09:02.610 --> 09:03.877
They sound ugly.

09:03.911 --> 09:05.245
>> EDGAR: Okay, uh, in Flipping

09:05.278 --> 09:06.446
Out on-on Bravo...

09:06.479 --> 09:07.781
>> LINDSAY: Ooh!

09:07.815 --> 09:08.949
>> EDGAR: ...are you the Jeff

09:08.982 --> 09:11.518
Lewis or the-the Jenni We Don't

09:11.551 --> 09:13.086
Know Her Last Name?

09:13.120 --> 09:14.688
>> LINDSAY: Oh, my God!

09:14.722 --> 09:16.523
I am totally the Jenni We Don't

09:16.556 --> 09:18.291
Know Her Last Name.

09:18.325 --> 09:20.460
Actually, I do-- it's Pulos.

09:20.493 --> 09:22.562
I'm a big fan.

09:25.966 --> 09:27.935
>> GRETCHEN: Yes. Okay.

09:27.968 --> 09:29.803
Oh, I... I'm not gonna tell

09:29.837 --> 09:30.771
him that.

09:30.804 --> 09:31.872
Okay. Bye.

09:31.905 --> 09:33.073
That was Lindsay.

09:33.106 --> 09:34.074
She wants us to get dinner with

09:34.107 --> 09:35.275
them tonight.

09:35.308 --> 09:36.209
Since we flaked last night,

09:36.243 --> 09:37.477
we should probably go.

09:37.510 --> 09:38.378
>> JIMMY: Whatever.

09:38.411 --> 09:40.380
As long as they have booze.

09:40.413 --> 09:42.482
>> GRETCHEN: Aw.

09:42.515 --> 09:45.953
Cheer up, Jimster.

09:45.986 --> 09:47.655
Or you could just really wallow

09:47.688 --> 09:49.657
in it.

09:49.690 --> 09:53.460
We could listen to some...

09:53.493 --> 09:55.162
The Smiths.

09:55.195 --> 09:57.530
They're sad and English, too.

10:00.133 --> 10:03.303
Or I could read you a little,

10:03.336 --> 10:06.774
uh, Jude the Obscure.

10:06.807 --> 10:08.175
(British accent): I hope our

10:08.208 --> 10:10.978
kids don't hang themselves

10:11.011 --> 10:13.380
because we're poor.

10:16.149 --> 10:18.185
I know what will cheer you up!

10:18.218 --> 10:21.188
We can do it backwards while

10:21.221 --> 10:23.757
you watch foot fetish anime.

10:23.791 --> 10:26.459
>> JIMMY: Pass.

10:26.493 --> 10:28.528
(Gretchen sighs)

10:30.297 --> 10:31.198
>> GRETCHEN: Well, I got to go

10:31.231 --> 10:32.132
to happy hour with Dana.

10:32.165 --> 10:33.200
If you think you're gonna kill

10:33.233 --> 10:34.034
yourself, remember there is a

10:34.067 --> 10:35.102
hotline for that or, you know,

10:35.135 --> 10:37.705
just text me.

10:46.246 --> 10:48.481
(door opens, closes)

11:01.829 --> 11:02.730
>> SANDRA BERNHARD: "When I was

11:02.763 --> 11:04.031
little, I never fantasized about

11:04.064 --> 11:05.833
having a baby of my own, unless

11:05.866 --> 11:07.467
we were playing war.

11:07.500 --> 11:08.969
I might grab someone else's

11:09.002 --> 11:10.337
child and run with them through

11:10.370 --> 11:11.905
the forest and hide them in a

11:11.939 --> 11:14.241
bramble.

11:14.274 --> 11:16.243
I wasn't like other girls, the

11:16.276 --> 11:18.078
ones who know from the start

11:18.111 --> 11:20.848
that they will be mothers,

11:20.881 --> 11:23.516
daydreaming about wedding days

11:23.550 --> 11:25.352
and lacy veils.

11:25.385 --> 11:26.920
They knew Daddy would walk them

11:26.954 --> 11:29.489
down the aisle, give them away.

11:29.522 --> 11:32.726
For me, it was not so, an

11:32.760 --> 11:35.362
observer...

11:35.395 --> 11:37.564
not a participant."

11:39.632 --> 11:42.335
(applause)

11:42.369 --> 11:43.536
>> DANA: Oh, girl, he is super

11:43.570 --> 11:44.337
hot.

11:44.371 --> 11:45.505
>> GRETCHEN: Really?

11:45.538 --> 11:46.774
Sometimes I think he looks like

11:46.807 --> 11:48.108
he's straight out of a Swedish

11:48.141 --> 11:49.109
vampire movie.

11:49.142 --> 11:50.377
>> DANA: No, he's a piece of

11:50.410 --> 11:51.278
sex.

11:51.311 --> 11:52.913
No surprise, though-- 'cause

11:52.946 --> 11:54.214
you're gorgeous.

11:54.247 --> 11:55.215
>> GRETCHEN: Aw, thanks.

11:55.248 --> 11:56.349
>> DANA: So, tell me about the

11:56.383 --> 11:57.350
boyfriend-- what's his deal?

11:57.384 --> 11:58.351
>> GRETCHEN: We don't really use

11:58.385 --> 12:00.120
that term, but, uh, he's a

12:00.153 --> 12:01.789
writer, he's British...

12:01.822 --> 12:02.890
he's usually very funny, but

12:02.923 --> 12:03.891
he's been super depressed

12:03.924 --> 12:04.792
lately.

12:04.825 --> 12:06.093
>> DANA: Every dude I've dated

12:06.126 --> 12:07.227
cannot handle being sad for,

12:07.260 --> 12:08.128
like, a second.

12:08.161 --> 12:09.797
Can you imagine not being able

12:09.830 --> 12:11.464
to fully experience your

12:11.498 --> 12:12.800
emotions?

12:12.833 --> 12:14.301
>> GRETCHEN: No.

12:14.334 --> 12:15.435
Well, we have a dinner later; I

12:15.468 --> 12:16.804
have to see if I can get him to

12:16.837 --> 12:17.437
rally.

12:17.470 --> 12:18.371
>> DANA: I should head out,

12:18.405 --> 12:19.572
too. I'll give you a ride.

12:19.606 --> 12:21.641
>> GRETCHEN: Okay.

12:23.476 --> 12:26.313
>> SANDRA: Thank you.

12:26.346 --> 12:27.781
>> JIMMY: I came here tonight to

12:27.815 --> 12:28.816
heckle you.

12:28.849 --> 12:30.784
And it would have been scathing.

12:30.818 --> 12:32.319
But I decided against it based

12:32.352 --> 12:34.087
on the strength of your work.

12:34.121 --> 12:35.255
And I wanted to share that

12:35.288 --> 12:36.790
compliment.

12:36.824 --> 12:38.658
And also have you sign this,

12:38.691 --> 12:39.893
please?

12:39.927 --> 12:40.828
>> SANDRA: What were your

12:40.861 --> 12:42.229
heckles?

12:42.262 --> 12:43.797
>> JIMMY: Oh, uh...

12:43.831 --> 12:45.565
All right. (chuckles)

12:45.598 --> 12:47.167
"Look! There's the second worst

12:47.200 --> 12:48.936
thing about the '80s--

12:48.969 --> 12:50.804
after Reagan's trickle-down

12:50.838 --> 12:51.939
economics, which immediately

12:51.972 --> 12:53.606
caused a 10.8% rise in

12:53.640 --> 12:55.943
unemployment and an explosion in

12:55.976 --> 12:58.145
income inequality."

12:58.178 --> 12:59.146
Just stuff like that.

12:59.179 --> 13:00.680
>> SANDRA: Who do you want this

13:00.713 --> 13:01.815
made out to?

13:01.849 --> 13:03.150
>> JIMMY: Oh, um...

13:03.183 --> 13:06.353
"To Ronny Overly, a father whose

13:06.386 --> 13:07.620
sole connection to his son is

13:07.654 --> 13:08.822
that he never connected with his

13:08.856 --> 13:09.823
father..."

13:09.857 --> 13:11.158
>> SANDRA: "Yo, Ron.

13:11.191 --> 13:12.759
So glad I have a big fan in

13:12.792 --> 13:13.693
the UK.

13:13.726 --> 13:15.695
Love, Sandra."

13:15.728 --> 13:17.831
>> JIMMY: Thank you.

13:17.865 --> 13:20.300
I'm actually an author myself.

13:20.333 --> 13:21.501
Congratulations, You're Dying.

13:21.534 --> 13:22.635
Perhaps you've heard of it?

13:22.669 --> 13:23.971
>> SANDRA: They carry it here?

13:24.004 --> 13:26.940
>> JIMMY: Bookstore manager?

13:26.974 --> 13:28.842
Sandra Bernhard here is

13:28.876 --> 13:30.610
interested in purchasing my

13:30.643 --> 13:31.444
book.

13:31.478 --> 13:32.946
>> MANAGER: I'm sorry.

13:32.980 --> 13:34.547
As Jimmy knows, he's been

13:34.581 --> 13:35.849
remaindered.

13:35.883 --> 13:36.984
>> SANDRA: That's such a waste

13:37.017 --> 13:37.484
of money.

13:37.517 --> 13:38.651
>> JIMMY: Thank you!

13:38.685 --> 13:39.519
It's a travesty.

13:39.552 --> 13:40.720
>> SANDRA: You know what they

13:40.753 --> 13:41.721
should have done?

13:41.754 --> 13:42.422
>> JIMMY: Yeah?

13:42.455 --> 13:43.223
>> SANDRA: They should've taken

13:43.256 --> 13:44.391
all the books they printed and

13:44.424 --> 13:46.659
thrown them directly into a hobo

13:46.693 --> 13:47.460
trash can fire.

13:47.494 --> 13:48.862
It would have saved a lot on

13:48.896 --> 13:49.562
shipping costs.

13:49.596 --> 13:51.498
>> JIMMY: You're an asshole...

13:51.531 --> 13:52.866
Man-dra Butt... Buttfart.

13:52.900 --> 13:53.901
>> SANDRA: Wow. Is that one of

13:53.934 --> 13:56.203
your previously written heckles,

13:56.236 --> 13:58.405
or was that just off the cuff?

13:58.438 --> 13:59.639
>> JIMMY: Tooth gap!

13:59.672 --> 14:00.740
Some-Something about your tooth

14:00.773 --> 14:01.541
gap.

14:01.574 --> 14:02.809
>> MANAGER: Enough, Jimmy.

14:02.842 --> 14:03.977
Philippe!

14:04.011 --> 14:05.078
>> JIMMY: What the...?!

14:05.112 --> 14:06.146
Don't you touch me, Philippe!

14:06.179 --> 14:08.015
I'm going.

14:08.048 --> 14:10.017
>> MANAGER: I am so sorry.

14:10.050 --> 14:11.151
>> GRETCHEN: Yeah, it's really

14:11.184 --> 14:12.886
pretty, huh?

14:12.920 --> 14:14.421
>> DANA: Mm. I love that.

14:14.454 --> 14:15.588
>> GRETCHEN: I'm in it for the

14:15.622 --> 14:17.424
money, just...

14:17.457 --> 14:19.692
(indistinct conversation)

14:21.028 --> 14:22.095
>> DANA: Is that Nancy from

14:22.129 --> 14:23.096
Roseanne?

14:23.130 --> 14:24.031
(Dana and Gretchen laugh)

14:24.064 --> 14:25.098
>> JIMMY: Don't want to talk

14:25.132 --> 14:26.033
about it.

14:26.066 --> 14:27.935
>> GRETCHEN: Jimmy, this is Dana

14:27.968 --> 14:30.070
from work.

14:30.103 --> 14:31.604
>> DANA: Hi.

14:31.638 --> 14:34.441
I've heard... so much about you.

14:34.474 --> 14:36.043
You weren't lying.

14:36.076 --> 14:37.177
He is like a sexy Swedish

14:37.210 --> 14:38.178
vampire.

14:38.211 --> 14:39.279
>> JIMMY: Sorry, ladies.

14:39.312 --> 14:41.748
I'm-I'm... I'm going to bed.

14:46.954 --> 14:49.456
>> GRETCHEN: This sucks.

14:49.489 --> 14:50.790
I need to snap him out of it

14:50.823 --> 14:52.025
somehow.

14:52.059 --> 14:53.060
>> DANA: Just bang the shit out

14:53.093 --> 14:54.194
of him, dummy.

14:54.227 --> 14:55.395
>> GRETCHEN: I tried!

14:55.428 --> 14:56.696
I'm sorry, Dana.

14:56.729 --> 14:57.965
This is not how you should be

14:57.998 --> 14:59.199
spending your night.

14:59.232 --> 15:00.400
You are way too fun and

15:00.433 --> 15:03.036
beautiful and spontaneous.

15:03.070 --> 15:04.204
You should just go.

15:04.237 --> 15:06.073
>> DANA: Do you want me to stay?

15:06.106 --> 15:07.941
>> GRETCHEN: Well, maybe we

15:07.975 --> 15:09.609
could go down there and...

15:09.642 --> 15:10.944
Oh, my God, I just had the

15:10.978 --> 15:12.079
craziest idea.

15:12.112 --> 15:13.280
>> DANA: What?

15:13.313 --> 15:14.647
You can just ask me to have a

15:14.681 --> 15:15.882
threesome.

15:15.915 --> 15:16.883
>> GRETCHEN: What?!

15:16.916 --> 15:17.817
(laughing): What?

15:17.850 --> 15:19.219
That is bananas.

15:19.252 --> 15:20.988
What are you even talking about?

15:21.021 --> 15:22.956
Can you imagine?

15:22.990 --> 15:24.091
Are you serious?

15:24.124 --> 15:25.993
>> DANA: Sure.

15:26.026 --> 15:27.660
>> GRETCHEN: Okay.

15:27.694 --> 15:28.495
>> DANA: Okay.

15:28.528 --> 15:29.562
>> GRETCHEN: Okay!

15:29.596 --> 15:30.497
(Gretchen laughs)

15:30.530 --> 15:31.564
Oh, this is awesome.

15:31.598 --> 15:32.765
This is guaranteed to cheer him

15:32.799 --> 15:33.633
up.

15:33.666 --> 15:35.068
He has never had a threesome

15:35.102 --> 15:36.169
before.

15:36.203 --> 15:37.104
>> DANA: Did he never go to

15:37.137 --> 15:38.171
middle school?

15:38.205 --> 15:40.440
>> GRETCHEN: Right?

15:50.383 --> 15:52.952
>> GRETCHEN: Jimmy.

15:52.986 --> 15:54.254
How you doing, buddy?

15:54.287 --> 15:57.857
We just wanted to make sure that

15:57.890 --> 15:59.259
you are doing okay.

15:59.292 --> 16:00.327
>> JIMMY: I'm fine, yeah.

16:00.360 --> 16:02.495
>> DANA: Well, we just wanted to

16:02.529 --> 16:04.197
make sure that you were extra

16:04.231 --> 16:06.166
fine.

16:17.177 --> 16:20.180
(slow, sultry music playing)

16:49.676 --> 16:52.679
*

17:07.927 --> 17:08.695
>> JIMMY: Uh...

17:08.728 --> 17:09.496
>> GRETCHEN: Is that... ?

17:09.529 --> 17:10.563
You came already?!

17:10.597 --> 17:11.531
>> DANA: Ugh.

17:11.564 --> 17:12.232
>> JIMMY: Uh...

17:12.265 --> 17:13.233
>> DANA: I guess this show got

17:13.266 --> 17:14.334
a little bit too sexy for you.

17:14.367 --> 17:15.435
>> GRETCHEN: What?

17:15.468 --> 17:16.403
It's his first time.

17:16.436 --> 17:17.237
Maybe he got a little

17:17.270 --> 17:19.339
overexcited.

17:19.372 --> 17:20.740
>> JIMMY: No, I didn't.

17:20.773 --> 17:23.443
In fact, the joke's on you.

17:23.476 --> 17:25.178
This is from a couple of minutes

17:25.212 --> 17:26.179
ago before you guys even came

17:26.213 --> 17:28.081
down.

17:28.115 --> 17:29.282
>> DANA: Oh, my God.

17:29.316 --> 17:30.450
>> GRETCHEN: Hold on.

17:30.483 --> 17:31.684
So, you masturbated to

17:31.718 --> 17:33.620
completion in the literally one

17:33.653 --> 17:35.122
minute from the time you left

17:35.155 --> 17:36.423
upstairs to this moment?

17:36.456 --> 17:37.557
>> JIMMY: I started at the top

17:37.590 --> 17:38.758
of the stairs.

17:38.791 --> 17:39.892
What? I couldn't help it.

17:39.926 --> 17:42.129
You're both so beautiful, and I

17:42.162 --> 17:43.863
started thinking about how you

17:43.896 --> 17:45.465
guys must have hugged earlier

17:45.498 --> 17:47.800
tonight, and when you did, did

17:47.834 --> 17:49.236
your... did your boobies get

17:49.269 --> 17:50.470
all, like, "squozen" together?

17:50.503 --> 17:51.538
>> DANA: And then you just laid

17:51.571 --> 17:52.739
there in it?

17:52.772 --> 17:55.208
>> JIMMY: Shut up... Dana!

17:55.242 --> 17:57.477
I was enjoying the afterglow!

17:57.510 --> 17:58.645
I didn't think you'd actually

17:58.678 --> 17:59.979
come down here, you giant

18:00.012 --> 18:00.813
weirdo.

18:00.847 --> 18:02.149
>> DANA: You masturbated while

18:02.182 --> 18:03.416
walking down the stairs carrying

18:03.450 --> 18:04.551
a giant Sandra Bernhard standee,

18:04.584 --> 18:05.952
and I'm the weirdo?!

18:05.985 --> 18:06.886
>> JIMMY: What?

18:06.919 --> 18:08.221
>> DANA: Yeah, I got to go.

18:08.255 --> 18:09.122
>> JIMMY: Oh, no. Wait!

18:09.156 --> 18:11.158
>> GRETCHEN: No. Wait!

18:12.959 --> 18:14.427
Well, now I get why you've never

18:14.461 --> 18:15.828
had a threesome.

18:15.862 --> 18:16.963
Dumb-ass.

18:16.996 --> 18:18.965
Dana?

18:22.269 --> 18:23.270
>> LINDSAY: I'm sure they'll be

18:23.303 --> 18:25.305
here any minute.

18:34.781 --> 18:35.748
>> JIMMY: What's the matter?

18:35.782 --> 18:36.749
>> GRETCHEN: I can't believe I

18:36.783 --> 18:37.950
finally made a new friend, and I

18:37.984 --> 18:39.486
tried to bang her the first time

18:39.519 --> 18:40.687
we hung out.

18:40.720 --> 18:42.455
I suck at girls, Jimmy.

18:42.489 --> 18:43.790
All the way back to the fourth

18:43.823 --> 18:45.858
grade when everyone was mean to

18:45.892 --> 18:47.260
me because I was the first

18:47.294 --> 18:49.529
person to grow boobs.

18:49.562 --> 18:51.164
Whatever, Jessica Olsen.

18:51.198 --> 18:53.866
You're still flat as shit.

18:53.900 --> 18:56.436
I guess I'm still that sad

18:56.469 --> 18:57.604
little ten-year-old girl

18:57.637 --> 18:59.806
sometimes, wishing someone would

18:59.839 --> 19:00.873
sit next to me on the side...

19:00.907 --> 19:02.275
>> JIMMY: Oh, my God, will you

19:02.309 --> 19:03.476
stop?

19:03.510 --> 19:04.611
>> GRETCHEN: What?

19:04.644 --> 19:05.812
>> JIMMY: No offense, but you're

19:05.845 --> 19:08.114
kind of making my skin crawl.

19:08.147 --> 19:09.782
>> GRETCHEN: (scoffs) Wow.

19:09.816 --> 19:10.783
Sorry.

19:10.817 --> 19:11.784
>> JIMMY: I'm not comfortable

19:11.818 --> 19:13.186
with... feelings.

19:13.220 --> 19:14.454
>> GRETCHEN: I listened to you

19:14.487 --> 19:15.988
blathering on about "Ooh, me

19:16.022 --> 19:17.724
Da."

19:17.757 --> 19:19.192
>> JIMMY: (laughs) That's Irish,

19:19.226 --> 19:20.327
dumb-dumb.

19:20.360 --> 19:21.794
And you didn't listen.

19:21.828 --> 19:23.530
You played Photo Hunt.

19:23.563 --> 19:24.897
And quite poorly, for the

19:24.931 --> 19:25.898
record.

19:25.932 --> 19:27.667
I don't know why I started

19:27.700 --> 19:29.702
unloading on you like that.

19:29.736 --> 19:33.340
I don't do... feelings.

19:33.373 --> 19:34.674
>> GRETCHEN: What the hell is

19:34.707 --> 19:36.743
wrong with us?

19:36.776 --> 19:38.745
>> JIMMY: Nothing.

19:38.778 --> 19:41.581
We should celebrate.

19:41.614 --> 19:43.516
We found someone who is equally

19:43.550 --> 19:44.651
dead inside.

19:44.684 --> 19:45.885
>> GRETCHEN: Let's make a pact

19:45.918 --> 19:47.254
never to feel anything around

19:47.287 --> 19:48.588
each other ever again.

19:48.621 --> 19:49.722
Deal?

19:49.756 --> 19:51.224
>> JIMMY: Deal.

19:51.258 --> 19:52.325
>> GRETCHEN: I can't believe

19:52.359 --> 19:53.493
you've been my boyfriend for,

19:53.526 --> 19:54.761
like, three days, and we already

19:54.794 --> 19:57.063
had to bring in a third party.

19:57.096 --> 19:58.197
What?

19:58.231 --> 19:59.266
>> JIMMY: You just said

19:59.299 --> 20:00.533
"boyfriend."

20:00.567 --> 20:01.668
>> GRETCHEN: Oh, whatever.

20:01.701 --> 20:03.570
It's... it's economical, okay?

20:03.603 --> 20:04.704
>> JIMMY: Sure.

20:04.737 --> 20:05.705
God, you have issues.

20:05.738 --> 20:06.906
>> GRETCHEN: You are the one who

20:06.939 --> 20:10.710
cried over a soccer jersey.

20:18.585 --> 20:20.287
Ooh.

20:20.320 --> 20:23.790
Actually... that is kind of hot.

20:23.823 --> 20:25.758
You look like a soccer hooligan.

20:25.792 --> 20:26.759
>> JIMMY: Yeah?

20:26.793 --> 20:27.694
>> GRETCHEN: I always had a

20:27.727 --> 20:29.128
thing for jocks, you know?

20:29.161 --> 20:30.730
>> JIMMY: Mmm...

20:30.763 --> 20:33.032
Hey, uh, we can pop inside and

20:33.065 --> 20:34.767
do it quick before we head to

20:34.801 --> 20:36.269
the diner, right?

20:36.303 --> 20:37.270
>> GRETCHEN: Oh, yeah.

20:37.304 --> 20:39.071
Oh, 15 minutes, tops. (laughs)
