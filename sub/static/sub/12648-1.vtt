WEBVTT

00:47.548 --> 00:49.314
 We're brave
and we'll stay so 

01:48.843 --> 01:52.111
- Oh!

01:55.282 --> 01:58.283
From his friends
in latin america."

01:58.285 --> 02:00.385
Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy!

02:00.387 --> 02:04.857
What a pleasant surprise!

02:04.859 --> 02:06.391
Whoops.

02:06.393 --> 02:10.128
Ah, now, isn't that wonderful?

02:10.131 --> 02:12.431
Which one should I open first?

02:12.433 --> 02:16.535
My mama told me to take...

02:16.537 --> 02:18.437
This one!

02:18.439 --> 02:23.876
I wonder what's in it.

02:23.878 --> 02:26.211
Oh, boy!
Home movies!

02:26.213 --> 02:28.580
Just what I wanted.

02:30.151 --> 02:32.217
Well, well, well.

02:32.219 --> 02:36.522
Well, doggone.
A little penguin.

02:36.524 --> 02:39.358
Oh.
What a cute little fella.

02:47.835 --> 02:49.334
Well, what is this?

02:49.336 --> 02:51.803
How do you open this thing,
anyway, huh?

02:51.805 --> 02:52.805
Whoa!

02:52.806 --> 02:55.874
Doggone...

02:55.876 --> 02:57.910
On with the show.

03:06.320 --> 03:08.754
The show must go on.

03:16.297 --> 03:17.963
<i>Aves raras.</i>

03:17.965 --> 03:19.531
-<i> Aves raras?</i>

03:19.533 --> 03:23.435
<i>Si, señor.</i>
That means strange birds.

03:23.437 --> 03:26.438
- Oh, sure, sure.
- Birds.

03:27.975 --> 03:30.976
Yes, amigo,
your feathered cousins.

03:30.978 --> 03:33.612
You know, donald, you have
more relatives here

03:33.614 --> 03:37.983
Than there are coffee beans
in brazil.

03:37.985 --> 03:42.788
For instance, take the one
who lives way, way down...

03:42.790 --> 03:44.507
ah!

03:44.508 --> 03:46.225
But suppose we let my friend
professor holloway

03:46.227 --> 03:50.229
Tell us about it,
from the beginning to...

03:50.231 --> 03:51.830
-<i> El fin,</i> the end.

03:51.832 --> 03:54.900
Yes. Thank you.
Professor?

03:54.902 --> 03:59.805
- This story takes us
way down to the south pole.

04:01.875 --> 04:04.443
Rather than have you
stand on your heads...

04:04.445 --> 04:06.445
Let's turn the theater over.

04:07.781 --> 04:09.348
There. That's better.

04:09.350 --> 04:12.417
Two things you will find
most of down here

04:12.419 --> 04:14.453
Are ice...

04:14.455 --> 04:17.022
And penguins.

04:17.024 --> 04:20.392
It's amazing that anybody
would want to live here.

04:20.394 --> 04:25.597
But most penguins wouldn't
live anywhere else.

04:25.599 --> 04:30.335
You couldn't find better weather
for fishing...

04:30.337 --> 04:31.603
Skiing...

04:31.605 --> 04:33.338
Tobogganing...

04:33.340 --> 04:35.874
Or swimming.

04:35.876 --> 04:39.011
And there is nothing the average
penguin likes better

04:39.013 --> 04:42.347
Than a day at the beach.

04:42.349 --> 04:44.850
Uh, but come on.
Let's meet pablo.

04:44.852 --> 04:47.953
He lives down
at the end of main street.

04:47.955 --> 04:51.023
Let's go in and see
what's cookin'.

04:51.025 --> 04:54.526
Pablo could never remember
having been warm enough,

04:54.528 --> 04:58.030
And so his closest companion
was smokey joe,

04:58.032 --> 05:01.566
His little stove.

05:07.341 --> 05:11.476
Between chills,
pablo had one burning desire...

05:11.478 --> 05:15.947
To spend the rest of his life
on some tropical shore.

05:18.385 --> 05:22.387
So we see him bravely set forth
for the isle of his dreams.

05:22.389 --> 05:26.325
The other penguins turned out
to give him a big send-off.

05:26.327 --> 05:31.096
But when he gets just so far
away from his stove...

05:34.468 --> 05:36.535
See what happens?

05:40.441 --> 05:41.873
Too bad.

05:41.875 --> 05:44.910
Perhaps he'll give up
this wild idea.

05:44.912 --> 05:50.449
But no.
He's off to another start.

05:50.451 --> 05:54.820
This time,
he's bringing a friend.

05:54.822 --> 05:56.888
Uh-oh.
Uh-oh!

05:56.890 --> 05:58.957
Uh-oh! Uh-oh!

05:58.959 --> 06:02.594
Oh, oh, oh, oh... Oh!

06:07.368 --> 06:09.901
Anyway, it was a hot idea.

06:12.755 --> 06:15.606
Well, maybe he'll be content
to stay at home this time.

06:20.514 --> 06:23.081
But no!
There he goes...

06:23.083 --> 06:26.918
Hotfooting it
to the land of the sun.

06:26.920 --> 06:31.890
By now, the farewell committee
has been reduced to two.

06:46.974 --> 06:50.041
Discouraging, isn't it?

06:54.448 --> 06:56.848
Suddenly,
pablo got one of those ideas

06:56.850 --> 07:01.019
That change a person's A boat.

07:01.021 --> 07:03.188
But where would he get a boat?

07:03.190 --> 07:04.190
Just watch.

07:13.434 --> 07:17.135
Where there's a will,
there's a way, they say.

07:17.137 --> 07:20.505
And now, the official launching.

07:29.216 --> 07:31.183
Day after day,

07:31.185 --> 07:34.486
The south wind
carried him north.

07:36.223 --> 07:39.991
One day,
a blanket of fog rolled in...

07:39.993 --> 07:43.528
And it was so thick...

07:50.938 --> 07:54.039
Must be near cape horn.

07:54.041 --> 07:56.241
As the fog lifted...

07:56.243 --> 08:01.179
He found himself headed straight
through the straits of magellan

08:01.181 --> 08:04.883
And northward
along chile's rocky coast.

08:04.885 --> 08:08.487
One day,
a storm cloud came up...

08:08.489 --> 08:10.889
Just a little bitty
old storm cloud, though...

08:14.094 --> 08:18.563
And just tried awful hard
to have its first storm.

08:20.501 --> 08:22.934
Didn't amount to much, though.

08:22.936 --> 08:26.938
One day on lookout,
pablo had a bit of a shock.

08:26.940 --> 08:29.508
A waterspout off the port bow!

08:32.179 --> 08:35.145
But it proved to be
the juan fernandez islands

08:35.148 --> 08:37.182
Where robinson crusoe
once lived.

08:37.183 --> 08:40.118
Hmm.
And still does, apparently.

08:43.957 --> 08:47.826
Four bells and all's well.

08:47.828 --> 08:50.061
According to pablo's chart,

08:50.063 --> 08:52.063
He should be nearing
vina del mar.

08:52.065 --> 08:56.301
And strangely enough,
that's just where he is.

08:56.303 --> 08:59.304
He sailed past lima,
capital of peru,

08:59.306 --> 09:02.307
Hugging the coastline
with a tenacity of purpose

09:02.309 --> 09:04.876
Seldom found in a penguin.

09:04.878 --> 09:07.212
One day, his telescope
picked out a city

09:07.214 --> 09:09.581
High up on top of a mountain.

09:09.583 --> 09:12.217
The map said it was quito,

09:12.219 --> 09:15.220
And it was right smack
on the equator.

09:17.324 --> 09:19.190
It wasn't as easy to cross,

09:19.192 --> 09:22.961
But with a little help
from neptune, he made it.

09:22.963 --> 09:25.931
So, making a left turn,
he followed the equator,

09:25.933 --> 09:29.200
Headed for
the galapagos islands.

09:29.202 --> 09:32.070
Ah, that good old sun.

09:32.072 --> 09:35.907
Pablo felt that
he'd never get enough of it.

09:41.181 --> 09:44.049
Oh, he hadn't counted on this.

09:44.051 --> 09:47.218
Things looked pretty bad.

09:47.220 --> 09:50.322
Help! Man the pumps!
She's sprung a leak!

09:50.324 --> 09:53.224
Pipe all hands on deck!
Do things! Get going!

09:53.226 --> 09:55.961
Take to the lifeboats!
Abandon ship!

09:55.963 --> 09:58.263
Unruffle the mizzenmast
and man the poops!

09:58.265 --> 10:01.299
And, well, don't just stand
there... get going!

10:01.301 --> 10:04.235
Swab the decks and...
Heavens!

10:43.143 --> 10:45.143
Look! What's that?

10:45.145 --> 10:47.278
Just what he's been looking for.

10:47.280 --> 10:51.916
Pablo has finally reached
the isle of his dreams.

10:55.222 --> 10:58.189
And so, as the warm tropical sun

10:58.191 --> 11:00.892
Sinks slowly in the west,

11:00.894 --> 11:04.362
We leave little pablo,
a bird in paradise,

11:04.364 --> 11:08.166
A picture of health
in his new coat of tan.

11:08.168 --> 11:12.671
He should be the happiest
penguin in the world.

11:12.673 --> 11:15.240
Only sometimes...

11:15.242 --> 11:19.411
He gets to thinking...

11:19.413 --> 11:22.113
never satisfied.

11:22.115 --> 11:24.315
Well, that's human nature
for you...

11:24.317 --> 11:26.184
Even if you're a penguin.

11:26.186 --> 11:29.454
- You're absolutely right.

11:29.456 --> 11:32.991
And now, donald,
let's hop over the andes.

11:35.328 --> 11:36.928
From these snowcapped peaks

11:36.930 --> 11:39.030
To the depths
of the amazon jungle,

11:39.032 --> 11:42.033
One finds many more
strange and exotic birds...

11:42.035 --> 11:45.403
Like the anambepreto
of colombia and venezuela.

11:45.405 --> 11:48.473
He carries his own bagpipes
hidden under his beard.

11:50.911 --> 11:53.244
Then there's his cousin,
the arapapa,

11:53.246 --> 11:56.281
Pride of paraguay,
whose perfect appearance

11:56.283 --> 12:00.251
Permits his pompous pride
in his pompadour.

12:00.253 --> 12:03.321
And la tijereta,
the scissors bird.

12:05.992 --> 12:08.126
The colombian cutup.

12:08.128 --> 12:11.963
Then there's
the arapacu de pico curvo.

12:11.965 --> 12:14.299
He's always sticking
his nose into things.

12:14.301 --> 12:16.234
Did you ever see
such a freak beak, huh?

12:17.337 --> 12:19.654
Speaking of beaks,

12:19.655 --> 12:21.972
What a time
two toucans have making love.

12:21.975 --> 12:23.308
When they're beak-to-beak...

12:23.310 --> 12:25.977
They can't get cheek-to-cheek.

12:25.979 --> 12:28.012
Because when one toucan
turns his head...

12:29.249 --> 12:32.083
Only one toucan can.

12:34.254 --> 12:36.354
- Uh-oh. Who's that?

12:36.356 --> 12:38.890
Oh, a thousand pardons.

12:38.892 --> 12:41.259
Señor donald, I would like
to have you meet

12:41.261 --> 12:44.262
One of the most eccentric birds
you have ever seen.

12:44.264 --> 12:46.498
His name is the aracuan.

12:46.500 --> 12:49.968
You'll find him most everywhere.

12:51.304 --> 12:56.307
Eh, glad to know ya.
Pleased to meet ya.

12:56.309 --> 12:59.110
Now, he's called the aracuan

12:59.112 --> 13:01.246
Because of the peculiar
song he sings

13:01.248 --> 13:03.381
Which sounds something
like this.

13:18.064 --> 13:19.364
By the way, amigo,

13:19.366 --> 13:22.100
Did you know some birds
are skilled craftsmen?

13:22.102 --> 13:25.036
- Uh-uh. Is that so?

13:25.038 --> 13:26.371
Yes.

13:26.373 --> 13:29.274
Quite a builder
is the little marrequito.

13:31.244 --> 13:33.411
His nest may look
haphazard in design...

13:33.413 --> 13:36.381
Ah, but every single
stick and straw...

13:38.385 --> 13:40.451
Is scientifically
placed to withstand

13:40.453 --> 13:43.087
The stress and strain of...

13:45.392 --> 13:49.294
Well...
almost anything.

13:49.296 --> 13:52.397
Literally dotted are the shores
of many tropical marshes

13:52.399 --> 13:55.433
With the brilliant plumage
of the flamingo.

14:14.837 --> 14:16.453
And now, donald, how would you
like to hear a story

14:16.456 --> 14:19.524
About another bird so amazing
you won't believe it?

14:19.526 --> 14:21.526
- Oh, sure.
You bet.

14:21.528 --> 14:26.364
It's a tale told by
an old gaucho from uruguay.

14:26.366 --> 14:27.432
Listen.

14:29.436 --> 14:32.003
- It was early one morning
in springtime

14:32.005 --> 14:34.372
Just as day was beginning
to break.

14:34.374 --> 14:36.107
As the sun came up over the...

14:36.109 --> 14:38.443
Oh, but I am forgetting
my story.

14:38.445 --> 14:41.012
It was silent out there
on the pampas.

14:41.014 --> 14:43.114
Only one little bird was awake.

14:43.116 --> 14:46.517
From his nest came the little
hornero to see if the...

14:46.519 --> 14:48.987
Oh, say, do you know why
this bird's called the hornero?

14:48.989 --> 14:51.956
- No?
- Uh-uh. Why?

14:51.958 --> 14:55.059
- You see, his nest
is just like the horno.

14:55.061 --> 14:57.428
That's the oven where
we bake our bread and our...

14:57.430 --> 15:00.365
Oh, oh, oh,
you know who that is?

15:00.367 --> 15:04.035
That's me, when I was
a little <i> gauchito.</i>

15:04.037 --> 15:06.271
Many, many years ago, of course.

15:06.273 --> 15:07.906
And why was I up so early?

15:07.908 --> 15:10.508
Because I was going out
hunting all alone.

15:10.510 --> 15:15.079
First I put on my <i> bombachas</i>
and tied on my <i> chiripa.</i>

15:17.417 --> 15:19.951
Then I slipped into
my new <i> botas.</i>

15:22.355 --> 15:23.521
And I put my <i> boleadoras</i>

15:23.523 --> 15:25.290
Where I could reach them
in a hurry.

15:25.292 --> 15:26.524
Gauchito!

15:26.526 --> 15:29.294
Not forgetting my hunting knife.

15:29.296 --> 15:31.329
And now I was ready to go.

15:31.331 --> 15:33.348
Ah...

15:33.349 --> 15:35.366
Now, the best place
to hunt the wild ostrich

15:35.368 --> 15:37.435
Is out on the wide open plains

15:37.437 --> 15:40.305
On the broad,
flat land of the...

15:40.307 --> 15:43.508
Flat land?
Say, what am I doing here?

15:43.510 --> 15:46.377
Oh, now I remember.

15:46.379 --> 15:48.346
This day I was hunting
for condor birds

15:48.348 --> 15:50.014
High up in the mountains.

15:50.016 --> 15:51.516
While looking around
for the condors,

15:51.518 --> 15:53.518
I climbed to the top of a rock.

15:53.520 --> 15:56.321
No, come to think of it,
it was a tree.

15:56.323 --> 15:58.523
Let's see,
maybe it was a rock after all.

15:58.525 --> 16:01.092
Although I could swear
it was a tree.

16:01.094 --> 16:04.128
Oh, what's the difference?
Let it go. Let it go.

16:04.130 --> 16:06.731
My sharp eyes soon discovered
the nest of a...

16:06.733 --> 16:09.734
Psst! Gauchito!
The nest.

16:09.736 --> 16:11.736
<i>El nido, el nido.</i>

16:11.738 --> 16:14.305
I could tell from the wings
he was...

16:14.307 --> 16:17.709
He was a least 5 meters
from tip to tip...

16:17.711 --> 16:19.344
The biggest condor bird
in all of...

16:19.346 --> 16:21.212
<i>Caramba!</i>

16:21.214 --> 16:24.716
What's this?
I couldn't believe my eyes.

16:24.718 --> 16:27.719
No, it couldn't be.
But there it was.

16:27.721 --> 16:31.356
I was looking face-to-face
with a flying donkey.

16:34.527 --> 16:37.228
The donkey bird
didn't seem bashful.

16:37.230 --> 16:38.563
He flew right up close to...

16:38.565 --> 16:42.467
Quick, gauchito.
Now! Get him, quick!

16:44.304 --> 16:47.138
Aha. Got him.

16:50.577 --> 16:53.745
Now, now. Easy, easy.

16:56.349 --> 16:58.383
Uh-uh-uh-uh-oh!

17:12.799 --> 17:15.032
This donkey should be
worth a fortune.

17:15.035 --> 17:17.167
I couldn't let him get away.

17:17.170 --> 17:19.170
So I made up my mind
that I'd catch him

17:19.172 --> 17:20.805
If it took me the rest of...

17:20.807 --> 17:22.406
Now I had him!
Hold him, gauchito!

17:22.409 --> 17:25.309
Ride him, cowboy!

17:25.310 --> 17:27.345
He acted just like he was loco,

17:27.347 --> 17:29.280
But I was an expert, of course.

17:29.282 --> 17:31.382
He thought he could
throw this gauchito,

17:31.384 --> 17:34.218
But he soon found out
who was the boss.

17:34.220 --> 17:38.723
Psst, gauchito!
Who is the boss?

17:38.725 --> 17:40.792
I decided to train him
for racing

17:40.794 --> 17:43.161
Far out where nobody could see,

17:43.163 --> 17:46.297
'cause I planned to win
thousands of pesos

17:46.299 --> 17:49.834
For this little burrito and me.

17:49.836 --> 17:51.169
I made brilliant plans

17:51.171 --> 17:52.336
For the future.

17:52.338 --> 17:54.806
We'd live like
a couple of kings,

17:54.808 --> 17:57.308
And I'd be the world's
richest gaucho

17:57.310 --> 18:00.378
With my hands
full of big diamond rings.

18:10.523 --> 18:14.425
<i>Ah, macanudo!</i>
Okay.

18:14.427 --> 18:17.862
This burrito
was tame as a kitten.

18:17.864 --> 18:19.864
He was learning new tricks
every day.

18:19.866 --> 18:22.867
You should see how
he begged for my mate.

18:22.869 --> 18:25.369
He liked it much better
than hay.

18:35.849 --> 18:39.350
- Then we soon fell asleep
by the campfire.

18:39.352 --> 18:42.353
We both were
as tired as could be.

18:42.355 --> 18:45.356
And tomorrow was very important

18:45.358 --> 18:48.326
For little burrito and me.

18:52.866 --> 18:55.433
For this was the day of fiesta.

18:55.435 --> 18:57.902
The gauchos were happy and gay.

18:57.904 --> 19:00.471
They danced the zamba and gatos

19:00.473 --> 19:04.142
And gambled their pesos away.

19:04.144 --> 19:06.410
While the crowd sang
and danced in the plaza,

19:06.412 --> 19:08.412
I just stood in the shade
of a tree

19:08.414 --> 19:11.415
And watched them toss coins
at the <i> sapo,</i>

19:11.417 --> 19:13.451
But this game
meant nothing to me.

19:13.453 --> 19:15.820
Some others
were rolling the <i> bochas</i>

19:15.822 --> 19:18.322
And betting on games
of this kind.

19:18.324 --> 19:20.858
But I didn't join
in these pastimes.

19:20.860 --> 19:23.461
I had something bigger in mind.

19:23.463 --> 19:25.463
-<i> Ay, caballo!</i>

19:25.465 --> 19:27.165
- The race was about to begin

19:27.167 --> 19:30.168
And the grand prize
was 1,000 pesos.

19:32.605 --> 19:35.306
The gauchos
were howling with laughter

19:35.308 --> 19:38.409
When they saw us
come out on the track.

19:42.348 --> 19:45.316
I whispered,
"remember the wings, burrito."

19:45.318 --> 19:48.486
Oh-oh-oh-oh!
Not yet! Not yet!

19:49.956 --> 19:51.589
The gauchos and horses
were all on their toes.

19:51.591 --> 19:54.425
-<i> Listos...</i>

19:54.427 --> 19:56.394
- We were off
with the speed of a bullet.

19:56.396 --> 19:58.429
We flew down the track
like the wind.

19:58.431 --> 19:59.964
Every gaucho was, uh, uh...

19:59.966 --> 20:02.867
Meanwhile, burrito and I
were, uh...

20:02.869 --> 20:04.769
Jockeying for position.

20:04.771 --> 20:07.471
Psst, gauchito!
They went that way.

20:07.473 --> 20:10.474
That way.

20:13.479 --> 20:15.213
No wonder they laughed.

20:15.215 --> 20:17.248
I didn't even
look like a jockey.

20:17.250 --> 20:19.984
Hey, gauchito.
Come on.

20:19.986 --> 20:23.287
Look like a jockey.

20:25.458 --> 20:28.326
Pepito, the pride of mendoza,
was setting a furious pace,

20:28.328 --> 20:31.462
And fuego, gordito, and pingo,
you never have seen such a race.

20:31.464 --> 20:34.332
Now it's pepito and fuego.
It's fuego and pepito.

20:34.334 --> 20:36.334
And there comes gordito
on the rail.

20:36.336 --> 20:38.302
Do your stuff, kid.

20:38.304 --> 20:40.471
No?
Well, don't wait too long or...

20:40.473 --> 20:42.306
Look out!

20:42.308 --> 20:45.343
Uh-huh.
What did I tell you?

20:45.345 --> 20:48.479
Come on, gauchito.
The wings, the wings.

20:48.481 --> 20:50.314
Quickly, I untied the rope.

20:50.316 --> 20:54.318
Come on, come on.
<i>Quickly,</i> I untied the rope!

20:58.358 --> 21:00.358
The knife! The knife!

21:00.360 --> 21:02.426
<i>Cortalo, cortalo!</i>

21:02.428 --> 21:04.028
And now we go.

21:04.030 --> 21:06.497
You should see little burrito
tearing up the track,

21:06.499 --> 21:09.934
So fast you couldn't see us.

21:17.377 --> 21:19.610
And now down the home stretch
comes fuego.

21:19.612 --> 21:21.345
Now pepito's ahead on the rail.

21:21.347 --> 21:22.813
Here comes pingo,
gordito, and gato,

21:22.815 --> 21:24.482
And dorado is right on his tail.

21:24.484 --> 21:27.018
But where is burrito?

21:27.020 --> 21:29.954
Here comes burrito!

21:29.956 --> 21:32.023
We passed them
like they were standing still.

21:32.025 --> 21:33.424
And now coming down across
the line of finish,

21:33.426 --> 21:36.427
It's burrito, the winner!

21:38.914 --> 21:41.398
Well, amigos, it was all over
but the shouting...

21:41.401 --> 21:43.034
I thought.
Uh-oh.

21:43.036 --> 21:46.971
<i>Caramba!</i>
The jig was up.

21:57.850 --> 22:00.351
- And what became
of the flying donkey, you ask?

22:00.353 --> 22:04.322
Neither him nor me
was ever seen again

22:04.324 --> 22:06.023
As long as we lived.

22:06.025 --> 22:07.591
Adios, amigo.

22:07.593 --> 22:10.594
- Adios. So long!

22:10.596 --> 22:14.365
Good-bye!

22:14.367 --> 22:16.901
What's going on here?

22:18.638 --> 22:20.338
Whaah!
Presents!

22:20.340 --> 22:22.573
Oh, boy!
Let me at 'em!

22:28.581 --> 22:30.614
Say, what's this?

22:53.106 --> 22:55.473
- Ah, pato donald.

23:00.113 --> 23:03.914
Or, as you americans say,
what's cookin'?

23:03.916 --> 23:08.386
- Joe carioca!
Well, I'll be doggoned!

23:08.388 --> 23:10.654
- Imagine meeting me here.

23:10.656 --> 23:14.158
Donald, have you ever been
to baia? No?

23:14.160 --> 23:16.093
- No, I haven't.

23:16.095 --> 23:18.162
- Ah, baia.

23:18.164 --> 23:20.498
Land of romance,

23:20.500 --> 23:22.533
Moonlight, music,

23:22.535 --> 23:24.034
Beautiful girls.

23:37.850 --> 23:40.151
Oh, forgive the interruption,
donald.

23:40.153 --> 23:43.487
This crazy bird is the aracuan.

23:43.489 --> 23:47.658
He's <i> meio maluco...</i>
A very stupid fellow.

23:47.660 --> 23:51.462
But tell me, donald,
have you ever been to baia?

23:51.464 --> 23:54.165
- No, I haven't.
- No? Oh...

23:54.167 --> 23:56.467
I am so sorry for you.

23:56.469 --> 23:59.170
Ah, baia.

23:59.172 --> 24:03.107
It is like a song in my heart.

24:03.109 --> 24:05.142
A song with love

24:05.144 --> 24:07.511
And beautiful memories.

24:11.617 --> 24:14.885
Ah. Baia.

24:14.887 --> 24:19.023
I close my eyes,
and I can see it now.

24:19.025 --> 24:23.227
I can see the beautiful twilight
in the sky.

24:23.229 --> 24:27.531
I can feel the breeze
from the bay...

24:27.533 --> 24:33.471
And I can hear the music,
the music of baia.

24:47.186 --> 24:51.222
 When twilight
is deep in the sky 

25:01.234 --> 25:05.603
 and so the loneliness
deep in my heart 

25:05.605 --> 25:10.508
 calls to you,
calls to you 

25:51.217 --> 25:57.087
-  can't you hear
my lonely call 

26:02.061 --> 26:09.099
-  make my life
complete again 

26:33.225 --> 26:39.630
-  when twilight
is deep in the sky, baia-ia 

26:47.173 --> 26:51.208
 and so the loneliness
deep in my heart 

27:11.330 --> 27:15.666
- Ah, baia.

27:15.668 --> 27:18.168
Beautiful baia.

27:23.275 --> 27:27.311
Oh, forgive me, but have
you been to baia, donald?

27:27.313 --> 27:29.880
- No.
- No? Well, let's go.

27:29.882 --> 27:32.249
If you go to baia, my friend,

27:32.251 --> 27:34.385
You'll never return.

27:39.091 --> 27:40.224
Have you been to baia, donald?

27:40.226 --> 27:43.193
- Uh-uh.
- Well, let's go!

27:43.195 --> 27:45.696
They have vatapa.
- What's that?

27:45.698 --> 27:48.298
- They have caruru.
- Is that so?

27:48.300 --> 27:50.200
- They have munguza.
- Munguza?

27:50.202 --> 27:52.336
- Do you like to samba?
- Oh, sure.

28:10.690 --> 28:13.257
- Have you been to baia, donald?
- No.

28:13.259 --> 28:15.292
- Well, let's go!

28:15.294 --> 28:17.261
When you go to baia, my friend,

28:17.263 --> 28:19.463
You'll never return.

28:23.369 --> 28:26.336
- Have you been to baia?

28:29.208 --> 28:31.275
- Uh-uh.
- Uh-uh.

28:31.277 --> 28:33.110
- Uh-uh.

28:33.112 --> 28:36.346
- No.
- No? Well, let's go!

28:43.122 --> 28:45.355
- Hurry, donald! Hurry!

29:46.152 --> 29:48.018
Well, well.

29:48.020 --> 29:51.255
Here we are in baia,
land of romance.

29:51.257 --> 29:54.892
- Baia? Where is baia?

29:54.894 --> 29:56.460
- We are in baia.

29:56.462 --> 30:00.030
Look.

30:00.032 --> 30:03.100
- Well, I'll be doggoned.

30:05.404 --> 30:09.039
- Who's that?
- Donald, that's yaya.

30:09.041 --> 30:12.009
- Who's yaya?
- Ah, a baiana.

30:19.285 --> 30:22.386
Donald,<i> quindins de yaya.</i>

30:22.388 --> 30:26.356
She sells cookies.
Cookies, my friend.

30:30.396 --> 30:33.030
- Uh-oh.

30:40.506 --> 30:41.506
- Whoa, whoa!

30:46.512 --> 30:48.912
- Donald!

31:09.101 --> 31:11.134
- Hello.
- <i> Como vai!</i>

31:13.472 --> 31:15.472
- Hi, toots.

31:18.477 --> 31:21.378
- What?

32:08.160 --> 32:09.927
- Who is that guy?

32:09.929 --> 32:12.262
- Oh, he's a malandro, donald.

33:09.154 --> 33:11.088
- Oh, boy!

33:28.741 --> 33:30.340
This donald!
Ha ha ha!

33:30.342 --> 33:34.077
Did you ever see
such a fast worker?

33:38.150 --> 33:39.282
- Ah-ah-ah!

33:55.534 --> 34:02.105
- Doggone it!

34:02.107 --> 34:05.275
- No, no, donald.
Take it easy.

34:05.277 --> 34:07.444
Look!

34:19.391 --> 34:21.391
- Whah!

35:28.293 --> 35:31.394
- Ohhhhh!

36:43.468 --> 36:46.469
- Come on, boys.

38:02.014 --> 38:04.047
What do you feel about baia,
huh?

38:04.049 --> 38:05.582
Tell me the truth.

38:05.584 --> 38:08.351
- Oh, swell! Marvelous!

38:08.353 --> 38:11.054
Romance.

38:11.056 --> 38:13.056
Moonlight.

38:13.058 --> 38:15.558
Beautiful girls.

38:22.034 --> 38:24.467
Or as you say, you are a wolf.

38:24.469 --> 38:26.903
Take it easy.
You have more presents.

38:26.905 --> 38:28.905
- Presents?

38:28.907 --> 38:31.408
More presents!

38:37.015 --> 38:40.617
What? Oh! Oh!
Oh, I'm a midget!

38:40.619 --> 38:44.354
Oh!
You! You're a midget too!

38:44.356 --> 38:47.023
- Ho ho, donald!
Don't worry.

38:47.025 --> 38:49.025
It is simple, my friend.

38:49.027 --> 38:52.896
Just a little black magic
will fix you up.

39:14.419 --> 39:16.853
Ha ha!

39:16.855 --> 39:20.056
Believe it or not,
it is very simple!

40:00.899 --> 40:03.466
You are very funny fellow!

40:13.145 --> 40:15.044
- Oh, my, my, my, my, my, my!

40:15.046 --> 40:16.913
- You kill my head!

40:29.928 --> 40:32.028
Ah-ah-ah!

40:32.030 --> 40:35.799
No, no...

40:35.801 --> 40:38.168
- Huh?
- Oh, my friend.

40:38.170 --> 40:40.870
You are using the wrong finger.

40:40.872 --> 40:43.106
Now, blow!

40:48.914 --> 40:50.980
- Thanks, pal!

40:50.982 --> 40:53.116
- B-b-b-but, donald,
your presents!

40:53.118 --> 40:55.985
- My presents!

40:55.987 --> 40:58.054
Look out!

42:06.925 --> 42:09.225
Ah-ha ha!

42:20.939 --> 42:22.205
Aha, my friends!

42:22.207 --> 42:24.240
<i>Bienvenidos, cuates!</i>

42:24.242 --> 42:25.575
Welcome to mexico.

42:25.577 --> 42:27.911
Son of a gun,

42:27.912 --> 42:30.246
It's a pleasure to see
such fine gentlemen in mexico.

42:30.248 --> 42:33.316
Here, amigos.
Donald!

42:33.318 --> 42:36.219
José.
Ha ha ha ha!

42:36.221 --> 42:37.320
<i>Caramba!</i>

42:37.322 --> 42:40.223
Now we're three gay caballeros.

42:40.225 --> 42:42.959
Yaaaaah!

42:45.597 --> 42:48.865
 We're three caballeros
three gay caballeros 

42:48.867 --> 42:51.935
 they say we are
birds of a feather 

42:54.973 --> 42:58.141
 we're happy amigos
no matter where he goes 

42:58.143 --> 43:02.111
 the one, two and three 'cause
we're always together 

43:04.983 --> 43:08.618
 we're three happy chappies
with snappy serapes 

43:08.620 --> 43:11.854
 you'll find us
beneath our sombreros 

43:14.859 --> 43:17.961
 we're brave and we'll stay so
we're bright as a peso 

43:17.963 --> 43:19.662
- Who says so?
- We say so...

43:28.073 --> 43:32.075
-  we have the stars
to guide us 

43:38.650 --> 43:41.851
 we sing and we samba
we shout,<i> ay, caramba </i>

43:41.853 --> 43:45.688
- What means <i> ay, caramba?</i>
- Oh, yes. I don't know.

43:48.660 --> 43:52.629
 Through fair
or stormy weather 

44:00.972 --> 44:03.306
 when some latin baby
says yes, no, or maybe 

45:00.965 --> 45:02.899
Ah-ha!

45:02.901 --> 45:05.935
- What's this?
- What's this?

45:05.937 --> 45:08.087
Ha ha ha ha!

45:08.088 --> 45:10.238
This is your gift from mexico,
A piñata.

45:10.241 --> 45:14.243
- Oh, boy, oh, boy!
A piñata!

45:14.245 --> 45:16.012
What's a piñata?

45:16.014 --> 45:19.282
- A piñata is full
of surprises, presents.

45:19.284 --> 45:21.384
It is the very spirit
of christmas.

45:21.386 --> 45:23.019
- Christmas?

45:23.021 --> 45:25.121
 Jingle bells, jingle bells,
jingle all... 

45:25.123 --> 45:27.356
- Oh ho ho!
No, no, donald.

45:27.358 --> 45:31.494
For goodness sake.
Not "jingly bells."

45:31.496 --> 45:35.998
In mexico,
they sing <i> las posadas.</i>

45:36.000 --> 45:38.034
This custom takes place

45:38.036 --> 45:41.370
On each of the nine days
before christmas.

45:41.372 --> 45:44.474
Each evening, the children
gather at the village church

45:44.476 --> 45:46.442
And form a procession

45:46.444 --> 45:49.145
Symbolizing
the journey of mary and joseph

45:49.147 --> 45:52.148
From nazareth to bethlehem.

45:52.150 --> 45:55.251
The little ones carry
images of the saints

45:55.253 --> 45:57.220
From house to house

45:57.222 --> 46:00.389
Singing a plea for shelter,
or <i> posada.</i>

46:00.391 --> 46:03.192
A reply comes from within:

46:03.194 --> 46:06.429
<i>"no posada.</i>
No shelter."

46:06.431 --> 46:10.166
Looking sad and downhearted,
they try again,

46:10.168 --> 46:13.069
But the reply is still the same.

46:13.071 --> 46:16.239
"no shelter.
<i>No posada."</i>

46:16.241 --> 46:19.442
They repeat this song
time after time

46:19.444 --> 46:23.112
And always they are refused...

46:23.114 --> 46:26.182
Until at last they reach
a friendly house,

46:26.184 --> 46:28.151
And the door is opened.

46:28.153 --> 46:30.987
"come in, come in,
holy pilgrims.

46:30.989 --> 46:33.322
This humble home is yours."

46:33.324 --> 46:37.393
And now, mary and joseph
have found shelter at last.

46:37.395 --> 46:40.096
Then the rejoicing begins...

46:40.098 --> 46:42.932
The feasting, the celebrating,

46:42.934 --> 46:46.135
And finally the biggest
surprise of all:

46:46.137 --> 46:48.971
Breaking the piñata.

46:51.075 --> 46:53.109
And now for your piñata, donald.

46:53.111 --> 46:54.977
Here you are.
Go to it.

46:54.979 --> 46:57.146
- One side, boys.
One side.

46:57.148 --> 46:59.115
I'm gonna smack it!

46:59.117 --> 47:01.250
- Uh-uh, no, hold it.
Ho-hold it, donald.

47:01.252 --> 47:03.986
First, you must be blindfolded.

47:03.988 --> 47:05.521
We have to put this
over your eyes.

47:05.523 --> 47:07.390
That's part of the tradition.

47:09.127 --> 47:11.294
- Now, now, now, stand here.

47:11.296 --> 47:14.130
Come here, now.
Hit it hard.

47:14.132 --> 47:18.000
All right,
let's see you smack it.

47:29.147 --> 47:30.980
Wait just a minute.

47:30.982 --> 47:32.315
Ah...

47:40.358 --> 47:46.062
- Uh-oh.
Aha!

48:28.973 --> 48:31.674
- You see, donald?

48:31.675 --> 48:34.376
Didn't I told you
it was full of surprises?

48:34.379 --> 48:37.947
Ah!
<i>La bandera mexicana.</i>

48:40.285 --> 48:44.020
Did you know that the history
of mexico is in her flag?

48:44.022 --> 48:47.023
Oh, yes! You see,
many hundreds of years ago,

48:47.025 --> 48:48.925
The god of the aztecs

48:48.927 --> 48:50.960
Commanded them to build
a big city

48:50.962 --> 48:52.995
Where they would find
an eagle destroying a serpent.

48:52.997 --> 48:54.931
But when they find this eagle,

48:54.933 --> 48:58.000
He was sitting
on a cactus on top of a rock

48:58.002 --> 49:00.937
Way out in the middle of a lake.

49:00.939 --> 49:05.074
<i>Caramba!</i> To build a city here
would be almost <i> imposible.</i>

49:05.076 --> 49:08.945
But they built and built
and built some more...

49:08.947 --> 49:11.013
Until today, believe it or not,

49:11.015 --> 49:14.951
The lake is full of mexico city.

50:13.111 --> 50:19.015
 Through a sky
filled with laughter 

50:28.126 --> 50:34.764
 made the blossoms
bloom around you 

50:49.514 --> 50:51.147
-<i> Oba! Oba!</i>

50:51.149 --> 50:52.815
Nice! Oh, boy!
- Wow!

50:52.817 --> 50:56.252
- Ah, but this is only
the beginning, amigos.

50:56.254 --> 50:59.422
Take a look at this one.

50:59.424 --> 51:02.358
- Oh, boy!
What a pretty picture!

51:02.360 --> 51:05.161
- And now, for a nice little
trip through mexico

51:05.163 --> 51:06.829
On the magic serape.

51:10.068 --> 51:14.503
All <i> a bordo,</i> amigos.
- Oh, what's goin' on here?

51:32.323 --> 51:38.828
 Made the blossoms
bloom around you 

51:56.347 --> 51:59.148
- And this, donald,
is patzcuaro,

51:59.150 --> 52:01.851
A fisherman's paradise.

52:01.853 --> 52:04.487
- Yeah! Beautiful!

52:04.489 --> 52:06.222
Oh, boy!

52:06.224 --> 52:08.290
Would I like
to come back sometime

52:08.292 --> 52:10.526
And do a little fishing.

52:10.528 --> 52:13.596
Uh-oh!

52:26.310 --> 52:29.345
- Ah ha ha ai!

52:33.918 --> 52:38.254
- What's going on here?
- Shh!

52:38.256 --> 52:42.191
This is my favorite dance,
the jarabe pateño.

53:20.431 --> 53:24.233
- Doggone it!
I can't get it.

53:24.235 --> 53:28.871
- No-no-no-no-no-no-no, boys!
You are off the beat.

53:28.873 --> 53:31.874
This is the way.

53:31.876 --> 53:35.311
- Well, what do you know?

54:03.341 --> 54:07.009
- Bravo, bravo!
- Bravo!

54:12.917 --> 54:16.885
- Thanks.
I had a wonderful time.

54:16.887 --> 54:18.921
- Adios!
- Adios, amigos!

54:18.923 --> 54:20.889
So long!

54:46.350 --> 54:48.550
- This is the way
they dance in veracruz.

54:48.552 --> 54:52.454
It's called the lilongo.

55:14.078 --> 55:17.980
- Hi, girls!
May I cut in?

55:17.982 --> 55:21.984
- Watch your step, donald!

55:21.986 --> 55:24.486
- Some fun, hey, kid?

55:34.498 --> 55:37.032
- So you like dancing, huh?
Okay.

55:37.034 --> 55:38.034
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

55:38.035 --> 55:40.035
Go on, donald.
Don't be afraid.

55:40.037 --> 55:43.038
Not so fast, boys.

55:43.040 --> 55:47.009
- Go on in, donald.
Don't be bashful.

55:47.011 --> 55:51.013
- Hi, toots!
Am I intruding?

55:55.419 --> 55:58.620
- Hey, donald, you are
what they say "off the cob!"

55:58.622 --> 56:01.824
You know, corny.
- Oh, yeah?

56:31.922 --> 56:35.791
- Swing me
with that boogie beat, joe!

56:43.134 --> 56:47.035
How am I doin', toots?
Ha cha-cha-cha-cha-cha!

57:25.943 --> 57:28.977
<i>Adios, lindas!</i>

57:28.979 --> 57:31.113
- Ah!
Come on, let me down.

57:31.115 --> 57:33.115
I wanna stay!

57:33.117 --> 57:36.185
Take it easy, donald.

57:50.201 --> 57:53.202
- There she is...
Acapulco beach.

57:53.204 --> 57:55.838
The riviera of mexico.

57:55.840 --> 57:57.139
Take the telescope
and have a look

57:57.141 --> 57:59.842
At what you might call
the hot stuff.

57:59.844 --> 58:01.176
- Oh, boy!

58:01.178 --> 58:05.547
Am I going to like this place.

58:05.549 --> 58:07.649
Ha... Ha!

58:07.651 --> 58:11.186
Oh, boy!
Hot stuff!

58:15.659 --> 58:18.927
- What? Whoo!

58:35.646 --> 58:39.615
<i>- muchacha!</i>

58:39.617 --> 58:41.950
- Aah!

58:41.952 --> 58:44.853
- I'll be right down, toots.

58:52.196 --> 58:54.196
- Aah!

58:54.197 --> 58:56.197
- Hello, my sweet little
bathing beauties.

58:56.200 --> 58:58.033
- Donald!
<i>Que simpatico!</i>

58:58.035 --> 59:01.203
-  we're three caballeros
three gay caballeros 

59:01.205 --> 59:04.206
 they say we are
birds of a feather 

59:09.647 --> 59:12.648
- Where's donald?

59:12.650 --> 59:14.983
- Aha!
I'm a son of a gun.

59:14.985 --> 59:17.085
Look at the little wolf
in duck's clothings.

59:17.087 --> 59:20.188
- Come to papa.

59:20.190 --> 59:23.825
Wha-what's going on here?

59:23.827 --> 59:26.929
Come here, you little rascals.

59:26.931 --> 59:30.999
Now I've got ya.
Uh-oh.

59:38.242 --> 59:40.909
- Doggone this confusion!

59:44.949 --> 59:49.084
Oops! Where is she?

59:49.086 --> 59:52.921
Come here, my little enchilada.

59:54.258 --> 59:57.893
I've got you this time, tootsie.

01:00:02.967 --> 01:00:05.667
Peek-a-boo.
I see you.

01:00:08.939 --> 01:00:11.139
Hey, where am I?

01:00:13.210 --> 01:00:16.011
Whoa, whoa!

01:00:18.082 --> 01:00:22.217
My, my, my!

01:00:22.219 --> 01:00:24.920
Ain't this fun?

01:00:37.034 --> 01:00:38.034
-<i> ¿donde esta?</i>

01:00:38.035 --> 01:00:40.402
Aah!

01:00:40.404 --> 01:00:42.371
- Here I come!

01:00:42.373 --> 01:00:45.173
This time I'm gonna get you!

01:00:45.175 --> 01:00:47.342
Whaah!

01:00:50.047 --> 01:00:52.948
- Oh, no, no, no, donald!
Don't do that!

01:00:55.019 --> 01:00:56.952
Let me go.
Get me outta here!

01:00:56.954 --> 01:00:59.171
You can't do this to me.

01:00:59.172 --> 01:01:01.389
Get your hands off of me!
This is a free country.

01:01:04.028 --> 01:01:06.028
- Bye-bye!

01:01:06.030 --> 01:01:07.963
- Heh heh heh.

01:01:07.965 --> 01:01:11.066
So you like pretty girls, huh?

01:01:11.068 --> 01:01:12.068
Let's go!

01:01:12.069 --> 01:01:14.302
Let me go!

01:01:14.304 --> 01:01:16.304
- Don't ruffle your feathers,
donald!

01:01:16.306 --> 01:01:21.309
Look, I will show you
the nightlife of mexico city.

01:01:21.311 --> 01:01:23.979
Beautiful, no?
- Colossal!

01:01:23.981 --> 01:01:27.049
- Oh, boy!
Mexico city?

01:01:27.051 --> 01:01:29.151
- Very beautiful city.
- Baah!

01:01:29.153 --> 01:01:32.054
- Ooh! Careful, donald.

01:01:32.056 --> 01:01:35.290
- Even the sky
is full of romantic!

01:01:41.065 --> 01:01:45.367
She's beautiful!

01:01:48.972 --> 01:01:50.372
- Oh, boy!

01:01:58.115 --> 01:02:03.385
 While a million guitars
played our love song 

01:02:03.387 --> 01:02:07.489
 when I said I love you,
every beat of my heart 

01:02:07.491 --> 01:02:11.359
Oh, boy, oh, boy.

01:02:33.083 --> 01:02:38.320
 And a million guitars

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:24.099

- don't do that!

01:03:36.513 --> 01:03:42.384
 And a million guitars
are still playing 

01:03:45.055 --> 01:03:50.425
 and you'll always belong

01:04:28.999 --> 01:04:31.533
 three caballeros

pretty girls. Pretty girls.

Pretty girls.
Pretty girls.

01:06:05.295 --> 01:06:08.563
- What? Oh, boy!

01:06:21.278 --> 01:06:23.378
- Uh-oh.

01:06:27.150 --> 01:06:29.284
- Oh ho!

01:07:06.423 --> 01:07:10.091
Uh, what's happening, anyway?
Where am I?

01:07:14.031 --> 01:07:17.098
Uh-oh!

01:07:27.310 --> 01:07:30.345
My, my!

01:07:45.162 --> 01:07:47.195
Uh-oh.

01:09:55.325 --> 01:09:57.859
- Ha...

01:09:57.861 --> 01:10:00.895
Ha ha ha ha... Hey!

01:10:09.339 --> 01:10:12.340
- Come on, torito,
give it to me!

01:10:12.342 --> 01:10:14.976
What's the matter with you?
Are you color-blind?

01:10:17.981 --> 01:10:19.814
Ole!

01:10:21.785 --> 01:10:24.886

You bashful?

01:10:28.925 --> 01:10:32.460
Ha ha ha ha ha-aee!

01:10:37.500 --> 01:10:39.467
Ole!

01:10:53.016 --> 01:10:54.849
Ow!

01:10:54.851 --> 01:10:59.287
-  oh, through fair
or stormy weather 

01:11:06.029 --> 01:11:09.964
 like brother-to-brother
we're all for each other
