WEBVTT

00:00.386 --> 00:01.853
<i>Previously on "Heartland":</i>

00:01.921 --> 00:04.455
It's good to see
Pegasus looking so good.

00:04.523 --> 00:06.590
Yeah, he really seems
to remember you.

00:06.658 --> 00:08.258
Ty here convinced me
that you could help.

00:08.326 --> 00:08.959
Dizzy, right?

00:09.027 --> 00:10.093
At this point,

00:10.161 --> 00:11.328
I'm willing to give
anything a try.

00:11.396 --> 00:13.297
If you wanna do
this kind of work,

00:13.364 --> 00:15.966
you have to put
your personal feelings aside.

00:16.033 --> 00:17.968
You don't like me,
you made that pretty obvious.

00:18.036 --> 00:18.969
You're just one
of those girls -

00:19.037 --> 00:20.237
you can't stand the fact

00:20.305 --> 00:21.504
that I'm still friends
with your boyfriend.

00:21.572 --> 00:23.606
I shouldn't have brought
Daisy here without asking you first.

00:23.674 --> 00:25.374
It was this time of year.

00:25.443 --> 00:26.309
Your mom?

00:26.376 --> 00:27.644
Yeah.

00:27.711 --> 00:29.979
<i>I was thinking maybe we should do
some kind of ceremony.</i>

00:30.047 --> 00:32.415
<i>Maybe go on a ride
to one of her favourite places.</i>

00:34.785 --> 00:36.452
A bit further.

00:37.754 --> 00:39.254
Don't look yet.

00:39.322 --> 00:41.323
Watch out.
There you go.

00:41.390 --> 00:43.224
Don't look yet.

00:43.292 --> 00:45.494
Okay, stay right there.
Ready?

00:45.562 --> 00:46.528
Open.

00:47.831 --> 00:49.431
Ta-da!

00:49.499 --> 00:51.132
What is it?

00:51.200 --> 00:53.568
It's our new dining lodge.

00:53.635 --> 00:55.937
I pictured it bigger.

00:56.472 --> 00:58.372
We can build it right here.

00:58.440 --> 01:00.808
<i>This is where the guests
will check in.</i>

01:00.876 --> 01:02.209
This is for
our branded products,

01:02.277 --> 01:03.611
like my jam,

01:03.679 --> 01:07.014
and this is our authentic
Western dining room.

01:07.983 --> 01:10.550
I'm gonna have
my wedding reception here, Dad.

01:10.618 --> 01:12.051
Lou, it's great.

01:12.987 --> 01:14.354
But can we afford this?

01:14.421 --> 01:16.255
Yeah. Yeah!

01:16.323 --> 01:17.824
Business is good.

01:17.892 --> 01:19.960
Clients are lined up
to see Amy,

01:20.027 --> 01:21.361
the dude ranch is steady

01:21.428 --> 01:23.396
and isn't that race horse
of yours cleaning up?

01:23.464 --> 01:25.163
Well,
he's doin' pretty well.

01:28.368 --> 01:29.401
Okay.

01:29.469 --> 01:31.036
Thank you, Dad.

01:31.104 --> 01:33.606
Thank you.

01:33.673 --> 01:34.573
Now, listen,
I've got an idea

01:34.641 --> 01:36.174
for this land here.

01:36.242 --> 01:38.043
Okay, let's not talk
about details.

01:38.111 --> 01:40.845
I gotta go check up
on a guest.

01:40.913 --> 01:41.779
Okay.

01:41.847 --> 01:42.680
<i>Okay.</i>

01:42.748 --> 01:43.815
See ya, Dad.

01:46.952 --> 01:49.387
<i>Hold on a sec!</i>

01:51.156 --> 01:52.423
Hey! Victoria.

01:52.491 --> 01:53.925
Thought I'd see
if you want some coffee.

01:53.993 --> 01:56.260
I'm fine,
thank you.

01:56.328 --> 01:57.995
Please don't knock on my door
in the morning.

01:58.062 --> 01:59.162
Oh, sorry.

01:59.230 --> 02:00.831
It's when I do
my equestrian pilates.

02:00.899 --> 02:03.000
Ght. Equestrian pilates.
Okay.

02:03.067 --> 02:04.334
Well, I'll let you
get back to it.

02:04.402 --> 02:08.038
There's no point now,
the workout's ruined.

02:08.104 --> 02:10.205
So, how's your sister
doing with Tango?

02:10.274 --> 02:11.307
Any progress?

02:15.478 --> 02:17.146
Tango...

02:17.213 --> 02:19.982
<i>Come on, stop weaving,
you're making me dizzy.</i>

02:20.050 --> 02:21.417
What's all this?

02:21.484 --> 02:22.785
Creatine?

02:22.853 --> 02:24.020
Glucosomine?

02:24.087 --> 02:25.755
Is Tango a body builder
or something?

02:25.822 --> 02:27.690
He's a dressage horse.

02:27.758 --> 02:29.858
He's got supplements
for everything -

02:29.926 --> 02:31.360
his joints,
his muscles,

02:31.428 --> 02:33.529
this one's for his coat.

02:33.596 --> 02:35.531
His owner wants me to find
the magical combination

02:35.598 --> 02:37.299
to cure his stall weaving.

02:37.367 --> 02:39.000
I don't think pills
can do that.

02:39.069 --> 02:40.669
Yeah.

02:40.736 --> 02:43.105
<i>My mom always thought it was
<i> 'cause they were bored or lonely.</i></i>

02:43.173 --> 02:45.440
Some people hang mirrors
in the stall,

02:45.507 --> 02:47.408
so they think
it's another horse.

02:47.476 --> 02:51.446
Or you could just turn him out
with the real horses.

02:55.451 --> 02:56.951
Here you go, bud.

03:03.991 --> 03:05.459
<i>Look at that,</i>

03:05.526 --> 03:08.195
Daisy, I think you got some
competition for Pegasus.

03:08.262 --> 03:10.730
<i>What's Tango doing in the pen?</i>

03:10.798 --> 03:13.866
I told you, Tango only leaves his stall
for training sessions.

03:13.934 --> 03:16.136
A just thought a little time out
would help with his weaving.

03:16.204 --> 03:17.570
Autumn showcase is
only a few weeks away.

03:17.637 --> 03:20.739
Please, just stick
to tweaking his diet.

03:20.807 --> 03:23.875
That's what I hired you to do.

03:24.411 --> 03:27.613
Morning, Jack.
Can I warm up your coffee?

03:27.680 --> 03:29.781
Okay, what do you need?

03:29.849 --> 03:31.250
A day off this weekend?

03:31.318 --> 03:33.684
Well, I'm not really the guy
to ask am I?

03:33.752 --> 03:35.653
Well, no, but Lou's on
that "let's bring Heartland"

03:35.721 --> 03:37.021
"to the next level" kick

03:37.089 --> 03:38.423
and I'm kinda scared
of her.

03:38.491 --> 03:40.391
Well, I don't know.

03:40.459 --> 03:42.093
With Caleb off playing
rodeo cowboy,

03:42.161 --> 03:43.394
we're a bit short-handed.

03:43.462 --> 03:44.795
I know,

03:44.863 --> 03:47.632
and I wouldn't ask
unless it was really important.

03:47.699 --> 03:49.100
So, I have this friend
that's being featured

03:49.167 --> 03:51.368
in a young artists show
in Calgary.

03:51.436 --> 03:53.003
This "artist,"

03:53.070 --> 03:56.806
his name wouldn't happen
to be Badger?

04:00.111 --> 04:02.879
All right,
I'll talk to Lou

04:02.947 --> 04:05.948
and see if we can manage
for a day without you.

04:06.016 --> 04:07.416
Thank you, Jack!

04:10.587 --> 04:12.821
Hey, what about my coffee?

04:14.000 --> 04:20.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:21.664 --> 04:23.431
Huh. That's weird.

04:23.499 --> 04:24.599
What's that?

04:24.667 --> 04:25.767
Well, usually when I go
to saddle her

04:25.834 --> 04:26.801
she moves away,

04:26.869 --> 04:28.170
but she's just standing
there.

04:29.905 --> 04:31.673
You all right, Daisy?

04:33.458 --> 04:35.093
Ty,

04:35.160 --> 04:36.995
she's sweating really bad.
Something's wrong.

04:42.667 --> 04:43.800
Good thing you called.

04:43.868 --> 04:45.301
She's got a fever
of 39 degrees,

04:45.369 --> 04:47.671
and glands are real swollen.

04:47.739 --> 04:49.439
What's wrong with her?

04:49.507 --> 04:51.108
I'll have to
take this swab back to the lab,

04:51.175 --> 04:54.176
but I think
it's strangles...

04:54.244 --> 04:56.712
<i>And you know what
that means.</i>

04:56.780 --> 04:58.114

05:42.389 --> 05:44.824
Okay, Scott.
Thanks for letting us know.

05:44.892 --> 05:46.859
Yeah, we'll be in touch.

05:48.028 --> 05:48.961
Daisy has strangles?

05:49.029 --> 05:50.396
Yeah.

05:50.463 --> 05:52.364
Well, how long is this
quarantine thing gonna last?

05:52.432 --> 05:53.666
It depends.

05:53.734 --> 05:54.867
On?

05:54.935 --> 05:55.802
<i>How many horses get it.</i>

05:55.869 --> 05:56.903
It's a very contagious virus.

05:56.970 --> 05:58.103
Great.

05:58.171 --> 05:59.337
<i>What if Copper gets it?</i>

05:59.405 --> 06:00.505
I read on the Internet
they call it "strangles"

06:00.573 --> 06:02.307
'cause it can actually
suffocate the horse.

06:02.374 --> 06:04.542
These giant zits push up
against their windpipes.

06:04.610 --> 06:05.577
Ew.

06:05.644 --> 06:07.345
They're called "pustules."

06:07.413 --> 06:10.215
Now, I have seen a few cases
of strangles over the years,

06:10.282 --> 06:13.984
and what we need to do
is isolate Daisy.

06:14.052 --> 06:16.453
And as soon as any
of the other horses get it,

06:16.521 --> 06:17.688
we do the same.

06:17.756 --> 06:19.223
Well, I have Daisy isolated
in a pen,

06:19.290 --> 06:21.258
but it's getting too cold
at night to keep her there.

06:21.326 --> 06:23.493
Well, then we'll clean out
the Quonset

06:23.561 --> 06:24.461
and put her in there.

06:24.529 --> 06:25.462
What about my jam?

06:25.530 --> 06:26.764
Oh...

06:26.832 --> 06:28.733
Okay, I'll find another place
for it.

06:28.800 --> 06:30.033
We're gonna have to
disinfect everything

06:30.101 --> 06:32.035
Daisy has come in contact with
as well.

06:32.103 --> 06:33.502
That would be like
everything.

06:33.570 --> 06:35.671
Well then, I suggest
we all get to bed early,

06:35.740 --> 06:39.008
because tomorrow is going to be
a very long day.

07:23.418 --> 07:25.051
This really sucks.

07:25.119 --> 07:27.154
Don't worry.
Copper's gonna be fine.

07:27.221 --> 07:28.555
It's not just Copper.

07:28.623 --> 07:30.123
My dad was gonna take me
to Calgary this weekend.

07:30.191 --> 07:32.192
But now he's singing
at the stupid fair

07:32.260 --> 07:33.527
in Brandon Creek,

07:33.595 --> 07:36.329
and I was really looking
forward to seeing...

07:36.397 --> 07:37.963
The art show.

07:38.031 --> 07:40.900
Now I have no way
of getting there.

07:40.967 --> 07:41.801
Unless...

07:41.868 --> 07:43.035
No.

07:43.103 --> 07:45.137
Come on, Jack.
It's just an afternoon.

07:45.205 --> 07:47.173
There's even this great
old person's movie

07:47.240 --> 07:48.708
you can check out
while I'm at the show.

07:48.776 --> 07:51.310
Don't you think
you should stick around here,

07:51.377 --> 07:52.811
close to Copper?

07:52.878 --> 07:54.613
I thought you said
he was gonna be okay?

07:55.548 --> 07:56.581
Fine.

08:00.019 --> 08:01.553
And set up this boot dip.

08:06.991 --> 08:08.426
Grandpa.

08:08.493 --> 08:10.661
Um, the horses
at the dude ranch,

08:10.729 --> 08:11.895
they're off on their own

08:11.963 --> 08:13.331
and it's a completely
different property,

08:13.398 --> 08:15.165
so they should be fine,
right?

08:15.233 --> 08:16.500
Well, technically.

08:16.568 --> 08:17.735
Well, they better be.

08:17.803 --> 08:20.738
I'm working on a deal
with Precipice Tours.

08:20.806 --> 08:22.439
They organize
company retreats.

08:22.506 --> 08:23.707
What ride a horse,

08:23.774 --> 08:25.908
find your inner cowboy
type thing?

08:25.976 --> 08:27.377
Yeah, make fun, Grandpa,

08:27.445 --> 08:30.046
but they're sending us
an insurance company next week.

08:30.113 --> 08:31.348
And if it goes well,

08:31.415 --> 08:32.782
they're gonna send a lot more
business our way.

08:32.850 --> 08:34.250
How much more?

08:34.318 --> 08:37.153
Enough to get started
on the new dining lodge.

08:37.221 --> 08:39.822
Unless this virus
screws everything up.

08:39.889 --> 08:42.090
It's gonna be just fine.

08:42.158 --> 08:43.325
You might wanna tell
those folks

08:43.393 --> 08:45.260
what's going on though.

08:45.328 --> 08:47.428
"Quarantine" can be
a scary word.

08:47.496 --> 08:48.830
Probably best to be up front.

08:48.897 --> 08:49.964
Yeah.

08:53.969 --> 08:55.436
Man, I'm tired.

08:55.504 --> 08:56.904
I think I pulled a muscle
in my back.

08:58.139 --> 09:00.074
We still have the barn to do.

09:00.141 --> 09:01.409
- Hey!
- Hey.

09:01.477 --> 09:03.110
How's my girl?
She ready to go?

09:03.178 --> 09:04.944
Well, uh...

09:05.012 --> 09:06.380
I tried to call you,
um...

09:06.447 --> 09:07.781
Yeah, yeah.
Sorry,

09:07.849 --> 09:10.484
I was packing my trailer
for the Charlesdale rodeo.

09:10.551 --> 09:12.952
Hey, girl.
Ready to run some barrels?

09:13.020 --> 09:15.255
Kit, uh, she can't go.

09:15.322 --> 09:17.023
What, I thought you said
she'd be ready?

09:17.091 --> 09:18.992
She is. She was.

09:21.294 --> 09:23.128
Daisy has strangles.

09:24.063 --> 09:25.464
Strangles?

09:25.532 --> 09:26.399
Yeah, it's a virus.

09:26.466 --> 09:29.001
Yeah,
I know what it is.

09:29.803 --> 09:31.771
I'm really sorry,
but she's gotta stay here.

09:32.906 --> 09:34.874
Yeah, okay.
Well then I'm staying too.

09:52.957 --> 09:56.059
<i>Slow it down, Victoria!</i>

10:03.267 --> 10:04.401
Come on, Victoria,

10:04.469 --> 10:05.636
don't let him get away
with that.

10:05.703 --> 10:07.770
Good is not good enough here.

10:10.307 --> 10:12.475
<i>Okay, show me a half-pass.</i>

10:25.888 --> 10:27.188
Wow! That was-

10:27.256 --> 10:28.323
Awful?

10:30.760 --> 10:31.860
It's the footing,

10:31.928 --> 10:33.027
the ground is full
of gopher holes.

10:33.095 --> 10:34.496
It's not the ground

10:35.431 --> 10:37.432
and it's not the horse.

10:37.500 --> 10:38.633
The sky's the limit for Tango.

10:38.701 --> 10:41.001
Here, come on,
let's switch.

10:41.069 --> 10:42.302
I'll show you how it's done.

10:47.041 --> 10:49.109
Victoria,
we have some bad news.

10:50.177 --> 10:51.946
One of our horses
has strangles.

10:52.013 --> 10:53.580
Has Tango been near
the horse?

10:54.649 --> 10:56.115
All the horses have.

10:57.651 --> 10:58.885
See, this is why I didn't
want Tango turned out.

10:58.953 --> 11:00.353
Anything can happen.

11:00.420 --> 11:02.789
You just don't know how to deal
with a horse at his level.

11:02.857 --> 11:04.290
We're leaving. Now.

11:04.358 --> 11:06.893
Your horse isn't going
anywhere.

11:06.961 --> 11:08.361
He's under quarantine.

11:09.296 --> 11:10.396
<i>Look, I'm very sorry,</i>

11:10.464 --> 11:12.631
but there's nothing
we can do about it.

11:12.699 --> 11:16.134
Wow, this just keeps getting
better and better.

11:17.937 --> 11:19.972
<i>Good girl, Daisy.</i>

11:20.039 --> 11:21.239
It's okay.

11:21.307 --> 11:23.742
Jack says
the Quonset hut's ready.

11:23.810 --> 11:25.711
Okay, I'll take her.

11:30.632 --> 11:31.766
She okay?

11:32.700 --> 11:33.934
I guess.

11:36.337 --> 11:38.372
I disinfected a section
of the back pen.

11:38.439 --> 11:40.141
We can keep Pegasus
out there for now.

11:40.208 --> 11:42.176
Why would we do that?

11:42.244 --> 11:43.410
Well, him and Daisy
have been spending

11:43.478 --> 11:45.111
a lot of time together -
grazing,

11:45.179 --> 11:46.612
drinking from
the same trough.

11:48.115 --> 11:50.616
Okay, did you run it
by Scott?

11:50.684 --> 11:53.219
I tried calling him,
but he's away.

11:53.287 --> 11:54.520
I've been reading up
on strangles though

11:54.588 --> 11:55.889
and there's like
a 99.9 percent chance

11:55.956 --> 11:58.624
that he's gonna get it.

11:58.692 --> 12:01.326
You know, he's too old
to leave out all night.

12:01.394 --> 12:03.361
What other choice
do we have?

12:03.429 --> 12:05.798
Can't put him in the barn
with the healthy horses.

12:05.865 --> 12:06.932
And Lou would kill me

12:07.000 --> 12:08.133
if I even suggested
the dude ranch.

12:08.201 --> 12:11.804
Okay, but it gets really cold
at night.

12:11.871 --> 12:13.138
I'll put a blanket on him,

12:13.206 --> 12:15.373
and I'll check on him
through the night.

12:50.874 --> 12:51.907
Hey.

13:05.888 --> 13:07.322
Kit?

13:07.890 --> 13:10.191
Oh my God, you scared me.
What're you doing here?

13:10.259 --> 13:11.592
Pegasus isn't doing so well
in the cold,

13:11.660 --> 13:12.626
so I'm setting up a pen
for him.

13:12.694 --> 13:13.728
What're you doing in here?

13:13.795 --> 13:15.563
Um...

13:15.630 --> 13:17.298
I want to be close to her.

13:17.366 --> 13:19.467
Well, there's a spare room
in the house.

13:19.534 --> 13:21.501
Yeah, I don't think
that's such a good idea.

13:21.569 --> 13:23.737
Well, the barn would be better
than here.

13:23.804 --> 13:26.340
That's an even worse idea.

13:26.407 --> 13:27.307
I'm okay.

13:27.708 --> 13:28.876
- Okay.
- 'Kay?

13:28.943 --> 13:30.610
Bundle up,
I'm gonna open this door here.

13:39.286 --> 13:41.187
So what's this gonna do
for business, huh?

13:41.255 --> 13:43.122
We're all fine,
thanks for asking.

13:43.190 --> 13:44.723
This is a big deal,
Jack.

13:44.791 --> 13:46.125
I'm gonna call Precipice
Tours this morning

13:46.193 --> 13:47.293
and tell them
what's going on.

13:47.361 --> 13:48.727
No, whoa on that,
honey.

13:48.795 --> 13:50.229
No, the dude ranch horses
are okay,

13:50.297 --> 13:51.697
so there's nothing
to tell them.

13:51.765 --> 13:53.198
Bad idea.

13:53.266 --> 13:55.400
The infected horse
has been separated, right?

13:55.467 --> 13:56.534
<i>Yeah.</i>

13:56.602 --> 13:57.335
I put Daisy out
in the Quonset hut.

13:57.403 --> 13:58.703
And just to be safe

13:58.771 --> 14:00.438
I put Pegasus out in a pen
last night.

14:00.506 --> 14:02.540
Actually, I had to move him
into the Quonset hut, too.

14:02.608 --> 14:03.641
You did what?

14:03.709 --> 14:05.210
Oh my God,
Pegasus has it?

14:05.278 --> 14:07.178
Not yet, but he's got
a really bad cough, so...

14:07.246 --> 14:08.545
What the hell
were you thinking?

14:08.613 --> 14:10.781
Come on, Tim,
it makes the most sense.

14:10.848 --> 14:13.150
Jack, you know how dangerous
this disease is...

14:13.218 --> 14:14.451
For a horse of his age?

14:14.519 --> 14:15.752
If we don't isolate him,

14:15.820 --> 14:17.254
we're gonna risk
all the horses getting it.

14:17.322 --> 14:20.324
If Pegasus gets strangles,
it'll kill him.

14:28.492 --> 14:29.826
<i>Hope your dad's right
about this.</i>

14:29.894 --> 14:32.062
- He seemed pretty sure.
- He always does.

14:36.801 --> 14:38.868
Hey, heard you guys
could use some help.

14:38.936 --> 14:40.569
Thank you,
you're awesome!

14:42.105 --> 14:43.171
Hey.

14:44.340 --> 14:46.174
So, uh, what can I do?

14:46.242 --> 14:48.143
Well, you don't really
need to be here.

14:48.211 --> 14:50.012
And I can look after Daisy.

14:50.080 --> 14:52.014
Um, no, you're short-handed,

14:52.082 --> 14:53.649
so, I'm here to help.

14:53.717 --> 14:55.584
Yeah, but, uh, Soraya
just got here,

14:55.651 --> 14:57.485
<i>so, I think we're good.</i>

14:57.552 --> 14:59.787
I'm sure there's enough work
to go around.

14:59.855 --> 15:01.022
<i>Okay?</i>

15:01.090 --> 15:02.156
'Kay.

15:03.558 --> 15:05.025
Okay.

15:13.768 --> 15:15.068
Victoria?

15:17.471 --> 15:18.505
Victoria...

15:20.306 --> 15:21.406
Are you okay?

15:27.648 --> 15:29.615
You threw up...

15:29.683 --> 15:30.916
In the outhouse.

15:30.984 --> 15:32.885
All morning.

15:32.953 --> 15:35.021
And I have a fever,
and my glands are swollen.

15:35.088 --> 15:36.021
Oh, that sounds like-

15:36.088 --> 15:36.988
<i>The flu!</i>

15:37.056 --> 15:38.089
I wouldn't be surprised

15:38.157 --> 15:40.291
if I caught it
from your horses.

15:40.359 --> 15:43.461
That's technically
not possible.

15:43.529 --> 15:45.697
I've gotta get outta here.

15:45.765 --> 15:48.066
I'll be at North Sky Resort.

15:48.134 --> 15:50.434
I hear they actually
have plumbing.

15:50.502 --> 15:52.002
And tell your sister
to keep Tango away

15:52.070 --> 15:54.604
<i>from the other horses.</i>

16:00.543 --> 16:01.911
Oh Daisy...

16:05.116 --> 16:06.750
Poor girl.

16:06.818 --> 16:08.484
These look so painful.

16:08.552 --> 16:10.186
Her temperature's
come down a bit.

16:10.253 --> 16:11.954
She's actually holding up
pretty good.

16:12.022 --> 16:14.590
Better than you,
by the looks of it.

16:14.658 --> 16:15.892
I've slept in a barn
before.

16:15.959 --> 16:17.593
I will live.

16:17.661 --> 16:18.861
You need to get some rest, Kit.

16:18.929 --> 16:21.030
Why don't you take the loft tonight?
I'll sleep down here.

16:21.098 --> 16:23.032
- The loft?
- Yeah.

16:23.100 --> 16:24.299
So like,
sleep where you dumped me?

16:27.070 --> 16:28.136
He's right, Kit.

16:28.204 --> 16:29.470
You'll get a better sleep there.

16:36.746 --> 16:37.846
Come on.

16:42.050 --> 16:45.219
I don't think Ty got Daisy
away from my horse in time.

16:45.286 --> 16:48.889
He doesn't seem to have
too much get up and go.

16:48.957 --> 16:50.224
He hasn't done much gettin' up

16:50.291 --> 16:52.727
and goin' in a lot of years.

16:52.794 --> 16:54.261
If you visited him
once in while,

16:54.329 --> 16:56.229
you might even know that.

16:56.296 --> 16:57.697
What's that supposed
to mean?

16:57.765 --> 16:59.465
Pegasus.

16:59.533 --> 17:01.467
I just think
it's a bit odd

17:01.535 --> 17:03.603
that his health is such
a big concern to you

17:03.670 --> 17:04.403
all of a sudden.

17:04.471 --> 17:05.605
I mean really, Tim,

17:05.672 --> 17:06.873
when was the last time
you came by

17:06.941 --> 17:09.209
to see "your" horse?

17:27.425 --> 17:28.693
Can I help you?

17:28.761 --> 17:30.695
Yeah, I'm
looking for Lou Fleming.

17:30.763 --> 17:32.364
What's this about?

17:32.431 --> 17:33.732
I'm with the Hudson Times.

17:33.799 --> 17:35.967
A woman called the news desk
with a wild story

17:36.034 --> 17:37.569
that she caught
some kind of flu

17:37.637 --> 17:39.437
from the horses out here.

17:39.505 --> 17:41.473
Sounded just crazy enough
to follow up on.

17:41.540 --> 17:43.808
Hmm. No comment.

17:43.876 --> 17:47.210
You can get off
the property now.

17:48.513 --> 17:50.314
Thanks for your time.

17:53.685 --> 17:55.018
<i>Wow, working here</i>

17:55.086 --> 17:57.220
<i>makes waiting tables
seem so slack.</i>

17:58.556 --> 18:00.223
It's not normally
like this.

18:00.291 --> 18:02.425
But thank God
you're here to help.

18:02.493 --> 18:04.794
Nice of Kit to show up, too.

18:05.262 --> 18:07.664
Yeah.
Yeah, it's good.

18:08.299 --> 18:11.801
Except she's spending most
of the time with her horse

18:11.868 --> 18:13.569
and... Ty.

18:13.637 --> 18:15.971
You' just upset that Kit
and Ty are still friends.

18:16.039 --> 18:18.407
No, that's not it.

18:20.310 --> 18:22.444
Okay, it is, but...

18:24.180 --> 18:25.380
Did you know

18:25.448 --> 18:28.016
that Kit is sleeping
in Ty's loft tonight?

18:28.283 --> 18:29.484
What?

18:30.319 --> 18:32.553
He's sleeping
in the Quonset hut, but...

18:32.621 --> 18:34.755
Then what's the big deal?

18:38.426 --> 18:39.727
<i>Hey.</i>

18:39.794 --> 18:41.461
Hope you're good
with peanut butter and jam.

18:44.465 --> 18:45.899
What?

18:45.967 --> 18:47.701
Feel his neck.

18:47.769 --> 18:48.768
Oh no.

18:50.337 --> 18:52.105
It's swollen.

18:52.172 --> 18:53.840
He's sweating
really bad, too.

18:58.078 --> 18:59.278
I told you this would happen.

19:06.119 --> 19:07.953
How was he through the night?

19:08.020 --> 19:09.221
He slept a bit,

19:09.288 --> 19:12.190
but he seemed really
uncomfortable.

19:12.258 --> 19:15.260
And he hasn't eaten anything
since yesterday afternoon.

19:15.327 --> 19:17.996
Hmm. At his age a virus
is gonna hit him hard.

19:18.064 --> 19:19.697
So what do we do?

19:20.399 --> 19:21.698
<i>Well, the most important thing to do</i>

19:21.767 --> 19:23.433
is get him eating.

19:23.501 --> 19:25.636
We don't want him
to get any weaker.

19:25.703 --> 19:27.204
Or?

19:27.272 --> 19:29.006
We just don't.

19:38.816 --> 19:39.749
Hey, honey.

19:39.817 --> 19:41.251
How is he?

19:42.186 --> 19:43.486
Not well.

19:44.255 --> 19:45.922
You read the paper today?

19:45.990 --> 19:47.757
Interesting article
on page three.

19:47.825 --> 19:49.358
<i>It's a great read.</i>

19:49.426 --> 19:51.661
It's about this woman who says
she got the horse flu...

19:51.728 --> 19:52.895
At Heartland.

19:52.962 --> 19:54.129
Idiot reporter.

19:54.197 --> 19:55.898
Yeah, is he?
Or is the idiot the one who,

19:55.965 --> 19:57.499
and I quote,
"declined to comment

19:57.566 --> 19:59.101
and asked him to leave
the property."

19:59.169 --> 20:00.302
I was being discreet.

20:00.369 --> 20:01.636
Well, all your discretion

20:01.704 --> 20:04.173
is gonna make this blow up
in our faces, Dad.

20:04.240 --> 20:05.774
Look, we should've been
up front with Precipice

20:05.842 --> 20:07.876
and we should've given
this guy an interview.

20:07.944 --> 20:09.443
Yes, we're under quarantine,

20:09.511 --> 20:11.545
but this makes it look like
we're hiding something bigger.

20:11.613 --> 20:13.747
It's a local paper.
Everything will be fine.

20:17.286 --> 20:18.686
Can you believe the
article in the Times?

20:18.753 --> 20:21.856
Can people actually catch
strangles?

20:22.691 --> 20:24.425
Uh, swine flu, bird flu,

20:24.492 --> 20:25.826
mad cow disease.

20:25.860 --> 20:28.261
Not to mention ebola virus
from chimpanzees.

20:28.329 --> 20:29.762
Can we pick up the pace?

20:29.831 --> 20:32.598
Maybe you could try working
as fast as you talk.

20:34.836 --> 20:38.404
So we have to leave around
11:00 tomorrow morning.

20:38.472 --> 20:40.207
Right... tomorrow.

20:41.141 --> 20:42.908
Okay, here's the thing.

20:42.976 --> 20:45.211
Now that Pegasus
has strangles,

20:45.278 --> 20:47.579
it's likely that
it'll keep spreading.

20:47.647 --> 20:51.383
So I need to stay here
and help out,

20:51.451 --> 20:52.784
and you too.

20:52.853 --> 20:55.988
But you understand that, right?

21:17.708 --> 21:19.609
Come here, baby.

21:22.881 --> 21:24.447
Remember this?

21:30.921 --> 21:32.588
It was Mom's.

21:34.791 --> 21:36.759
Can you smell that?

21:38.996 --> 21:41.797
Pegasus,
you've gotta eat.

21:41.865 --> 21:42.765
Hey...

21:44.001 --> 21:45.133
Look at me.

21:46.068 --> 21:47.102
Hey.

21:59.081 --> 22:00.415
You okay?

22:01.482 --> 22:03.617
I just wish
I could get him to eat.

22:03.684 --> 22:07.054
Maybe there's something
in your mom's journal.

22:10.225 --> 22:11.191
I'm sorry.

22:11.259 --> 22:13.460
Please, no, don't.
Okay?

22:14.896 --> 22:16.930
I'm just holding it together
as it is.

22:16.997 --> 22:20.133
He's like
my last link to her

22:20.200 --> 22:21.367
and...

22:22.336 --> 22:23.469
I feel like
this is my fault.

22:23.537 --> 22:25.271
You know, I...

22:26.506 --> 22:28.441
I'm seeing all these
client horses

22:28.508 --> 22:30.376
and who knows where that virus
could've come from.

22:30.444 --> 22:32.412
Come on, Amy, that's...

22:32.479 --> 22:34.646
That's not true, okay?

22:34.713 --> 22:35.780
Trust me.

22:37.216 --> 22:38.317
What?

22:39.652 --> 22:41.553
It's just, um...

22:42.255 --> 22:45.523
Some girls came into the diner
last night.

22:45.591 --> 22:48.226
I've seen them before,
they're barrel racers.

22:49.761 --> 22:52.963
Do you know if Kit's horse
was at the Salma Valley rodeo?

22:58.210 --> 23:00.711
Was your horse at the
Salma Valley rodeo?

23:02.482 --> 23:03.983
Yeah. Why?

23:04.051 --> 23:06.518
I think you know why, Kit.

23:06.586 --> 23:08.287
This is all your fault.

23:11.058 --> 23:12.424
Amy...

23:17.663 --> 23:18.563
I'm outta here.

23:18.630 --> 23:19.664
Good.

23:21.867 --> 23:23.301
What the hell
was that about?

23:23.368 --> 23:26.204
A bunch of horses came down
with strangles at that rodeo.

23:26.271 --> 23:28.606
Kit and Daisy competed there.

23:28.674 --> 23:30.008
So?

23:30.076 --> 23:31.008
So she must have known
that her horse was at risk

23:31.076 --> 23:32.409
and she brought her here
anyway.

23:32.476 --> 23:33.844
Come on, Amy.

23:33.912 --> 23:37.347
You don't believe that.
She wouldn't do that.

23:37.415 --> 23:39.482
Yeah. I guess you would
think that now,

23:39.550 --> 23:40.584
wouldn't you?

23:56.900 --> 23:58.400
<i>Hey...</i>

23:58.468 --> 24:00.870
I was just out
at the dude ranch.

24:00.938 --> 24:02.738
The horses all look okay.

24:02.805 --> 24:05.807
Thank God for small miracles.

24:06.743 --> 24:09.644
Heartland Equestrian
Connection.

24:09.712 --> 24:12.914
Hi, Kim. Yeah.
I was gonna call you.

24:13.850 --> 24:16.551
Can I just...
But...

24:17.519 --> 24:19.586
Okay, if you just
let me explain.

24:24.092 --> 24:26.593
So, an executive
at the insurance company

24:26.661 --> 24:28.195
has a sister in Hudson

24:28.263 --> 24:30.231
and she read the Hudson Times.

24:30.298 --> 24:32.800
They don't want to risk getting
the "horse flu."

24:32.868 --> 24:33.901
What's your point?

24:33.969 --> 24:35.501
They've cancelled
the retreat, Dad,

24:35.569 --> 24:38.704
and Precipice Tours wants
nothing to do with us.

24:38.773 --> 24:41.374
Just a local paper, huh?

24:46.480 --> 24:48.147
Hey.

24:48.215 --> 24:50.216
So, any luck
with his weaving?

24:50.284 --> 24:52.617
No, I think he's really
stressed out.

24:53.586 --> 24:54.753
About what?

24:54.820 --> 24:56.654
About the training.

24:56.722 --> 24:58.924
Even a top level horse
can have limitations.

24:59.992 --> 25:01.626
A "top level" horse
wouldn't have trouble

25:01.694 --> 25:03.595
with this training.

25:03.662 --> 25:04.930
What are you saying?

25:04.998 --> 25:06.398
Don't get me wrong,
Tango's a good horse.

25:06.465 --> 25:09.367
He's a good...
Mid-level horse.

25:10.335 --> 25:12.669
But I thought you said
that the sky is the limit.

25:12.737 --> 25:14.238
Look, sometimes people
like Victoria

25:14.306 --> 25:15.773
they need to hear
that kind of thing,

25:15.840 --> 25:17.875
otherwise they may give up
on the horse altogether

25:17.943 --> 25:20.544
and that just wouldn't be
fair to Tango here.

25:20.612 --> 25:23.146
Yeah, right...
And you'd lose a client.

25:23.214 --> 25:26.182
Oh my God!
He's soaked in sweat.

25:27.118 --> 25:29.719
Amy! It's Pegasus.

25:29.787 --> 25:31.388
It's like he can't breathe.

25:38.095 --> 25:40.029
He's in pretty rough shape.

25:40.931 --> 25:43.832
He doesn't even have
any of those pustules though.

25:43.900 --> 25:46.601
He does -
they're in his gut.

25:46.636 --> 25:47.869
That's why he won't eat.

25:47.938 --> 25:49.338
He's in a lot of pain.

25:51.174 --> 25:53.275
I hate to say this, guys,

25:53.343 --> 25:57.378
but it might be just best
to put him down.

26:08.523 --> 26:09.690
No! No.

26:10.892 --> 26:14.227
We're just not
going there, Jack.

26:14.963 --> 26:16.063
That horse is a fighter,

26:16.130 --> 26:17.164
he can make it
through this.

26:17.231 --> 26:18.365
If he's suffering-

26:18.433 --> 26:20.367
No. Nobody is gonna
give up on Pegasus.

26:20.435 --> 26:22.169
He's my horse.

26:23.271 --> 26:24.838
I'll decide
what's best for him.

26:29.709 --> 26:31.277
I can't believe
this is happening.

26:31.345 --> 26:33.179
Yeah.
You're telling me.

26:33.246 --> 26:34.580
Instead of enjoying
my engagement,

26:34.647 --> 26:36.382
I'm obsessing about
the millions of ways

26:36.450 --> 26:38.784
this quarantine could kill
our business.

26:38.852 --> 26:40.752
Oh, and you wanna hear
how Victoria took the news

26:40.820 --> 26:41.854
about Tango?

26:41.921 --> 26:43.688
Lou, I'm talking
about Pegasus.

26:43.755 --> 26:45.090
He's out there
fighting for his life

26:45.157 --> 26:47.592
and you're in here
worrying about business?

26:47.659 --> 26:48.860
Do you think I like
being the one

26:48.927 --> 26:50.661
who always has to watch
the bottom line, Amy?

26:50.729 --> 26:52.397
Have you even been out
to see him?

26:52.465 --> 26:54.199
We could be in serious
trouble here, okay?

26:54.266 --> 26:55.400
You don't even care
about him!

26:55.468 --> 26:56.934
Of course I care about him.

26:57.003 --> 26:58.103
Well, you're not showing it.

26:58.170 --> 26:59.603
You know what?
You...

26:59.670 --> 27:02.373
You wouldn't understand, Amy,
you were so young.

27:02.440 --> 27:03.607
When? What?

27:03.674 --> 27:04.708
You have no idea
what it was like

27:04.775 --> 27:06.110
watching this family
fall apart

27:06.177 --> 27:08.445
when Mom and Dad split.

27:08.513 --> 27:10.047
So what does that have
to do with Pegasus?

27:10.115 --> 27:12.182
Because when things
were at there worst,

27:12.250 --> 27:14.184
Pegasus gave Mom hope.

27:14.252 --> 27:15.784
As long as she could
keep him alive,

27:15.852 --> 27:17.620
she was okay.

27:17.687 --> 27:20.990
So the thought
of losing him now...

27:21.058 --> 27:23.826
I'm just scared, Amy,
that's all.

27:26.263 --> 27:28.297
It's okay.

27:30.534 --> 27:31.599
Hey, boy.

27:38.441 --> 27:40.108
C'mon. Come here.

27:40.176 --> 27:42.044
You gotta eat somethin'.

27:42.878 --> 27:44.646
Come on, buddy,
just one bite.

27:48.150 --> 27:49.150
Oh, I know, I know.

27:49.217 --> 27:50.651
Come on. Give it a try.
Come on.

27:56.624 --> 27:57.858
Listen, I'm sorry.

27:57.926 --> 27:59.793
I never shoulda left you
the way I did.

28:02.264 --> 28:04.064
And I wanna thank you
for looking after my girls

28:04.098 --> 28:06.032
all those years, huh?

28:06.100 --> 28:09.169
When I was getting
myself together.

28:10.137 --> 28:11.271
Hey, boy.

28:12.440 --> 28:13.873
Hey, how does that
make you feel, huh?

28:13.941 --> 28:15.108
Come here.

28:17.545 --> 28:18.678
Come on, boy.

28:18.745 --> 28:20.979
<i>That's it...
That's it...</i>

28:24.750 --> 28:26.818
I have some
fenugreek in here.

28:26.886 --> 28:28.987
I read about it
in Mom's journals.

28:29.055 --> 28:31.790
It should help sooth
his throat.

28:46.638 --> 28:48.072
You okay, Dad?

28:54.178 --> 28:56.079
You see this saddle?

28:57.681 --> 29:02.319
I must have sat on it
a thousand times in the box.

29:03.254 --> 29:07.056
As soon as that chute
would open, I'd...

29:07.124 --> 29:09.525
I'd yell,
"Go get 'im, boy!"

29:09.593 --> 29:12.728
He'd be on that steer's tail
in seconds.

29:12.795 --> 29:17.799
He was the best damn
bulldoggin' horse I ever had.

29:17.867 --> 29:21.803
We won this saddle
in our first big rodeo.

29:21.871 --> 29:25.273
It got us through
my whole career.

29:26.942 --> 29:29.944
Then why did you
just leave it here?

29:30.012 --> 29:31.712
Well, your grandpa Jack

29:31.780 --> 29:33.314
didn't exactly give me
a lot of time

29:33.382 --> 29:36.384
to pick up my things.

29:36.452 --> 29:38.953
And what about Pegasus?

29:39.021 --> 29:40.154
After the accident,

29:40.188 --> 29:42.722
you just kind of
abandoned him.

29:42.790 --> 29:45.159
Well...

29:45.226 --> 29:47.327
I guess I sorta held
a grudge against him.

29:47.395 --> 29:49.163
Why?

29:49.230 --> 29:50.864
Your mom.

29:51.799 --> 29:53.500
She spent all her time
fixing Pegasus,

29:53.568 --> 29:54.601
not me.

29:56.002 --> 29:59.305
She told me
you wouldn't let her.

30:02.409 --> 30:04.644
Well, she was right.

30:07.363 --> 30:10.265
I sort of gave up
on myself.

30:12.402 --> 30:16.238
But we're not gonna give up
on Pegasus.

30:20.977 --> 30:23.312
Your mom never would.

30:34.489 --> 30:35.656
It's been a long day.

30:35.723 --> 30:38.292
You should try
and get some sleep.

30:38.360 --> 30:40.494
All these books
say the same thing.

30:40.562 --> 30:41.996
If a horse has come in
close contact

30:42.064 --> 30:44.998
with an infected one,
he's gonna get it.

30:45.066 --> 30:46.099
He's gonna get strangles.

30:46.167 --> 30:48.768
Ty, quit blaming yourself.

30:49.703 --> 30:51.338
I never should've put him
with Daisy.

30:51.405 --> 30:53.706
As a vet, you're gonna have
to make some tough decisions.

30:53.774 --> 30:56.809
Some will be right
and some won't.

30:56.877 --> 30:59.979
Ty...
You made a choice

31:00.046 --> 31:02.581
with the animal's
best interest at heart.

31:02.648 --> 31:05.284
That's way more right
than it is wrong.

31:25.700 --> 31:27.567
I've come to take
my horse home.

31:29.537 --> 31:30.904
What's going on?

31:30.972 --> 31:32.139
Why does he look like that?

31:32.206 --> 31:33.840
I know it doesn't
look pretty,

31:33.908 --> 31:35.542
but it's the infection
working its way out.

31:35.609 --> 31:37.543
It's totally normal.

31:37.610 --> 31:39.211
He's really fighting
for his breath.

31:40.113 --> 31:41.781
My God, is he gonna be
all right?

31:41.848 --> 31:44.583
He's got a pustule pushing
up against his windpipe.

31:44.651 --> 31:46.686
<i>Should we call Scott?</i>

31:49.222 --> 31:50.622
He can't breathe, Amy.

31:51.925 --> 31:53.091
<i>We gotta do this now.</i>

31:53.159 --> 31:54.693
What is he doing?

31:54.760 --> 31:55.827
It's okay.

31:58.831 --> 32:00.732
Do you know
what you're doing?

32:00.800 --> 32:02.466
I hope so.

32:02.534 --> 32:03.702
- Can you hold this?
- Yes.

32:03.769 --> 32:04.869
- Keep his head up?
- Yep.

32:04.937 --> 32:07.138
No, no, don't!
He's scared.

32:07.206 --> 32:08.872
It's okay.
Keep him still, okay?

32:08.940 --> 32:10.440
Okay.
Just keep him calm.

32:10.508 --> 32:11.508
<i>Good boy...</i>

32:11.576 --> 32:13.077
Here we go.

32:13.144 --> 32:15.412
It's okay.
It's okay, Tango.

32:15.479 --> 32:16.747
They're gonna help you, boy.

32:23.722 --> 32:26.589
Is he gonna be okay?
Please say he's all right.

32:26.656 --> 32:29.391
I got it.
His windpipe's clear.

32:29.459 --> 32:30.659
Easy, boy.

32:31.595 --> 32:32.695
He's good.

32:32.763 --> 32:34.230
<i>He's gonna be fine.</i>

32:37.735 --> 32:40.236
Good boy.
There you go.

32:47.576 --> 32:48.643
Hey.

32:50.079 --> 32:51.613
Hey.

32:51.680 --> 32:52.680
You okay?

32:52.749 --> 32:54.182
Yeah. Fine.

32:55.017 --> 32:58.252
That was pretty tough
to watch.

32:58.319 --> 33:00.187
That horse is my life.

33:00.255 --> 33:02.656
It's obvious how much
you care for Tango.

33:02.724 --> 33:05.525
But you have impossible
expectations

33:05.593 --> 33:08.829
and the pressure is
what's making him weave.

33:08.897 --> 33:10.564
What is this?

33:11.599 --> 33:13.166
Are you trying to get back at me
for the article?

33:13.234 --> 33:14.267
No.

33:14.334 --> 33:16.069
Did your sister
put you up to this?

33:16.137 --> 33:18.071
This is not about Lou, okay?

33:18.139 --> 33:21.641
This... this has to do
with your coach.

33:21.708 --> 33:23.342
She's not being straight
with you.

33:23.410 --> 33:27.080
She... she's filling your head
with dreams of Grand Prix

33:27.148 --> 33:29.481
and the truth is
she thinks that...

33:29.715 --> 33:34.086
She thinks that Tango's
more mid-level.

33:34.154 --> 33:36.021
She said that?

33:36.089 --> 33:38.657
I think you should cut yourself
and Tango some slack.

33:38.691 --> 33:40.625
Okay?
Just have fun.

33:43.696 --> 33:46.264
Dressage isn't about having fun.

33:46.331 --> 33:49.100
It can be...
if you let it.

33:56.775 --> 33:57.875
Ty?

33:58.877 --> 34:01.477
Hey, I need to talk to you.

34:01.545 --> 34:02.813
Look, Kit,

34:02.880 --> 34:04.514
Amy's a lilile stressed out
about Pegasus.

34:04.581 --> 34:05.515
She didn't mean-

34:05.582 --> 34:07.317
No. She's right.

34:08.252 --> 34:11.221
Daisy probably did get
strangles at that rodeo.

34:11.289 --> 34:12.522
Why'd you bring her
here then?

34:12.589 --> 34:13.989
Well, I swear I didn't know
about the outbreak

34:14.058 --> 34:15.692
until she was already here.

34:15.759 --> 34:17.659
Well, you shoulda taken her back
when you found out.

34:17.726 --> 34:20.295
There were no symptoms
so I thought she was fine.

34:20.362 --> 34:22.031
Well, she wasn't.

34:22.098 --> 34:23.232
I know.

34:25.768 --> 34:27.268
I'm so sorry, Ty.

34:30.473 --> 34:32.708
Please don't hate me.

34:35.777 --> 34:37.378
I gotta go check
on the rest of the horses.

34:40.514 --> 34:42.283
I'll see you around, okay?

34:42.351 --> 34:43.451
Yeah.

34:44.652 --> 34:45.386
Hi, Kit.

34:45.454 --> 34:46.620
Hi.

34:46.688 --> 34:48.223
All right, Copper,
let's go.

34:48.290 --> 34:49.688
What? Copper too?

34:49.757 --> 34:51.158
I think so.

34:51.659 --> 34:53.126
I'll put him in
the back pen for now.

34:53.194 --> 34:54.561
Oh... I better
let Mallory know.

34:54.628 --> 34:56.763
Lend me your phone.

35:05.405 --> 35:08.774
Good mornin', Jess.
Jack Bartlett here.

35:08.842 --> 35:09.942
Good thanks.

35:10.010 --> 35:12.111
I'm calling for
your daughter.

35:12.179 --> 35:13.779
Said she's over here?

35:14.714 --> 35:16.182
Oh, well...

35:16.250 --> 35:17.750
Well, I've had
a real busy mornin',

35:17.817 --> 35:19.018
I probably...

35:19.086 --> 35:21.452
She's probably out
in the barn.

35:21.520 --> 35:23.288
Okay.
I'll talk to you later.

35:38.970 --> 35:40.670
You gone nuts.

35:42.107 --> 35:43.374
You don't understand.

35:43.441 --> 35:45.776
Oh, I understand just fine.

35:46.677 --> 35:51.615
This guy feels like the most important thing
in the world right now.

35:51.682 --> 35:52.883
But a year from now

35:52.950 --> 35:54.817
you probably won't even
remember his name.

35:54.885 --> 35:56.352
I will too.

35:56.420 --> 36:00.223
Trust me, I've been surrounded
by women for a long time.

36:00.291 --> 36:01.590
Lou, Amy...

36:01.658 --> 36:04.327
Hell, even Marion's attention
got a big split

36:04.395 --> 36:07.964
between horses and boys,
right about your age.

36:08.032 --> 36:09.597
She learned.

36:14.070 --> 36:16.604
The boys,
they come and go;

36:16.672 --> 36:19.707
A good horse...
With you for the long haul.

36:19.775 --> 36:21.543
I'm not picking Badger
over Copper,

36:21.610 --> 36:23.312
if that's what
you're saying.

36:23.629 --> 36:24.762
Hey, look,

36:25.830 --> 36:31.001
the bond that Marion had
with Pegasus...

36:31.069 --> 36:33.870
Mallory,
I just know that...

36:33.938 --> 36:35.372
She would've regretted
putting anything

36:35.440 --> 36:38.008
in front of that horse.

36:38.810 --> 36:40.877
Did Copper get it?

36:43.647 --> 36:44.880
Let's go.

36:44.948 --> 36:45.981
Okay.

36:57.360 --> 36:59.194
You better call your dad.

37:14.309 --> 37:15.643
Hi, honey.

37:19.615 --> 37:20.715
Hey, boy.

37:22.884 --> 37:24.452
<i>Look at you.</i>

37:34.061 --> 37:35.595
Now I remember
when I bought this guy.

37:36.530 --> 37:38.765
He bucked me off
on the test drive.

37:40.734 --> 37:42.935
The owner said
he was too much horse

37:43.003 --> 37:45.738
<i>and he just wanted
to get rid of him.</i>

37:45.806 --> 37:47.706
But you know your old man.

37:47.775 --> 37:49.842
I couldn't pass up
a bargain.

37:54.513 --> 37:57.249
It was the best deal
I ever made.

37:58.184 --> 37:58.850
Hey, boy?

38:14.199 --> 38:15.266
Easy.

38:19.137 --> 38:20.104
I'm okay.

38:20.172 --> 38:21.872
<i>Easy... easy...</i>

38:23.909 --> 38:24.909
That's it.

38:58.747 --> 39:01.081
<i>I'm sorry...</i>

39:01.083 --> 39:03.316
About Pegasus...

39:03.384 --> 39:05.019
About everything.

39:06.888 --> 39:10.223
I can't believe you
let your horse stay here,

39:10.291 --> 39:12.526
even after you knew.

39:13.862 --> 39:16.129
'Cause she seemed okay.

39:16.197 --> 39:19.566
And... and you were doing
such a great job with her,

39:19.633 --> 39:23.169
and I wanted to get back
into competition.

39:24.738 --> 39:26.472
Okay, I was selfish.

39:31.211 --> 39:33.679
I don't know what else to say.
I don't know what I can do.

39:37.416 --> 39:41.152
We're heading out
to do this memorial.

39:42.855 --> 39:45.490
You could stay here
and watch the sick horses.

39:47.894 --> 39:48.961
Okay.

39:53.131 --> 39:55.332
This will be
home for now, Copper.

39:55.400 --> 39:56.567
When I get back
from the service,

39:56.635 --> 39:58.368
I'll give you
a nice brush down.

39:58.436 --> 39:59.971
Here you go.

40:00.038 --> 40:01.706
He'll be all right, Mallory.

40:04.042 --> 40:06.042
So how is Tango doing, boss?

40:06.110 --> 40:08.111
Well, you did a great job, Ty.

40:08.178 --> 40:09.278
Just make sure
to keep it clean.

40:09.346 --> 40:11.081
Will do.

40:11.148 --> 40:12.448
And just so you know,

40:12.516 --> 40:15.418
I would've put Pegasus in
with Daisy too.

40:17.187 --> 40:18.722
So how do the other
horses look?

40:18.789 --> 40:20.456
Well, they seem
healthy to me.

40:20.524 --> 40:22.658
You just have to let it
run its course with these guys

40:22.726 --> 40:25.393
and we can lift
that quarantine.

40:25.461 --> 40:26.495
Good.

40:41.844 --> 40:43.177
Strangles?

40:43.245 --> 40:45.279
Oh, that really screws us.

40:45.347 --> 40:47.915
We won't be able to school
'til he's over it.

40:47.983 --> 40:49.250
Longer.

40:49.317 --> 40:50.384
It's dangerous to work him
for weeks

40:50.452 --> 40:51.819
after his symptoms
are gone.

40:51.887 --> 40:53.087
What?

40:53.155 --> 40:54.521
No, that is bull.

40:54.588 --> 40:56.056
I've schooled horses
just a few days after.

40:56.124 --> 40:57.124
It's fine.

40:57.191 --> 40:59.026
How dare you.

40:59.093 --> 41:00.727
You want to put
my horse at risk

41:00.795 --> 41:02.929
so you can make
your damn training fees.

41:02.997 --> 41:04.164
Where's this coming from?

41:04.231 --> 41:06.867
My "mid-level" horse.

41:06.934 --> 41:08.334
Ah.

41:08.402 --> 41:09.536
We're done here.

41:09.603 --> 41:11.170
You know what?
That's fine.

41:11.237 --> 41:13.272
I'm sick of dealing
with mediocrity anyway.

41:13.339 --> 41:14.940
We're mediocre?

41:15.008 --> 41:17.009
Look in the mirror, Linda,
and ask yourself

41:17.077 --> 41:19.045
what kind of trainer
lies to her clients

41:19.112 --> 41:21.513
to stay in business?

41:33.292 --> 41:34.492
Hey.

41:34.560 --> 41:36.895
- You ready?
- Yup.

41:38.030 --> 41:39.364
You okay?

41:40.432 --> 41:41.932
I'm glad that Pegasus
was at that ride

41:42.000 --> 41:43.800
we did for Mom.

41:44.769 --> 41:46.169
It's almost like he waited.

41:48.639 --> 41:51.641
<i>Tim, can I have a word?</i>

41:52.710 --> 41:54.611
Wonder what I did wrong
this time?

41:58.348 --> 41:59.882
Yeah?

41:59.950 --> 42:01.517
You know this saddle...

42:01.584 --> 42:04.553
Has been taking up space here
for a lot of years

42:04.621 --> 42:08.424

a million times.
