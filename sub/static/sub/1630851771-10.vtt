Previously, on "Below Deck"...

00:02.459 --> 00:03.667
I'm engaged.

00:03.667 --> 00:05.083
You're engaged?

00:05.083 --> 00:06.292
You stuck your tongue
down my throat,

00:06.292 --> 00:08.083
and you don't wanna say nothing?

00:08.083 --> 00:11.459
How did this happen,
please tell us.

00:11.459 --> 00:12.584
Ah!

00:12.584 --> 00:15.083
Jake is very attractive.

00:15.083 --> 00:16.334
I might have a little crush.

00:16.334 --> 00:17.542
Kiss, because I wanna see it.

co-primary Chelsea
will be coming aboard

I love silent disco.

00:34.501 --> 00:36.209
I'm really sorry,
I need to leave.

00:36.209 --> 00:38.542
At the end of the day,
I come first.

00:38.542 --> 00:40.501
Jess just said,
"I'm gonna leave."

00:40.501 --> 00:42.125
Oh, my God.

00:42.125 --> 00:49.250
Crew search, interior,
third stew.

00:49.250 --> 00:52.709
Heather, can we get some
liquid food for Chelsea, ASAP?

00:52.709 --> 01:11.626
Of course.

01:11.626 --> 01:14.417
She's got a
chicken breast coming right up

01:14.417 --> 01:16.918
right now, liquid.
Yeah, of course.

01:16.918 --> 01:19.417
Heather, Heather,
Chelsea's curry is ready.

01:19.417 --> 01:21.584
Copy that.

01:21.584 --> 01:23.375
We had one job...
to serve the primary first.

01:23.375 --> 01:25.584
We're a man down,
and it's showing.

01:25.584 --> 01:28.042
Things are feeling stressful.

01:28.042 --> 01:30.959
Chelsea is weeping in
her cabin between courses.

01:30.959 --> 01:33.209

01:33.209 --> 01:34.584

01:34.584 --> 01:36.542

01:36.542 --> 01:38.584
Well, I don't know if we are.
I'm doing the best I can.

01:43.375 --> 01:44.375
Okay.

01:44.375 --> 01:46.375
She's having a meltdown.

01:46.375 --> 01:48.542
Can I take it to her room?
Did she go down?

01:48.542 --> 01:50.083
-She went to the restroom.
-Oh, okay.

01:50.083 --> 01:51.083
Hopefully, she'll
be right back.

01:51.083 --> 01:55.000
Beautiful.

01:55.000 --> 01:56.250
I do believe there's a
chicken breast in there,

01:56.250 --> 01:58.417
as well as some other
ingredients.

01:58.417 --> 02:01.042
So, give it a try.

02:01.042 --> 02:02.667
It's just not...

02:02.667 --> 02:04.083
not appropriate to bring us
all food without food for you.

02:04.083 --> 02:05.334
Yeah.

02:05.334 --> 02:06.709
Can I please clear
this for you?

02:06.709 --> 02:09.125
We really wanna emphasize

02:09.125 --> 02:11.417
we don't wanna eat
until she gets food.

02:11.417 --> 02:13.667
Of course, I'll be sure of it.
You have my word.

02:13.667 --> 02:23.584
-Thank you very much.
-Of course.

02:23.584 --> 02:25.584
Are we gonna test them out?

02:25.584 --> 02:27.250
Oh, it's working.

02:27.250 --> 02:29.000
Oh, hell, yeah.

02:39.167 --> 02:41.626
Okay, things that
make ya go "hmm."

02:41.626 --> 02:44.626
So, his issue is that,
like, he didn't want them

02:44.626 --> 02:46.626
being served shellfish and
not her having something.

02:46.626 --> 02:48.125
Like, if we're
gonna bring this up,

02:48.125 --> 02:49.292
we need to bring her
another cup...

02:49.292 --> 02:50.584
-Yeah, we will.
-That is blended.

02:50.584 --> 02:52.292
Yeah, I'll just do it...

now found something

-I'll follow.

03:09.501 --> 03:14.250
Let me set hers down first.

03:14.250 --> 03:18.083

with a locally grown breadfruit,

Chelsea, I'm sorry.

03:34.667 --> 03:39.459
Yeah, we'll completely respect
how you wanna handle it..

03:39.459 --> 03:42.209

10:33.209 --> 10:34.209
Would you mind pouring
that for me while I...

10:34.209 --> 10:35.250
-Sure.
-Thank you.

10:35.250 --> 10:37.042
Maybe a minute.

10:37.042 --> 10:38.709
Perfect, I'll be right back,
as soon as I drop this.

10:38.709 --> 10:40.626
Are we taking
the trampoline out too, yeah?

10:40.626 --> 10:41.709
Oh, trampoline.

10:41.709 --> 10:44.125
So, this is your
breakfast order.

10:44.125 --> 10:45.125
Ah.

10:45.125 --> 10:46.918
Your eggs, sir.

10:46.918 --> 10:48.042
-How y'all doing?
-Oh, we're... we're good.

10:48.042 --> 10:49.209
-Yeah?
-Is it thick, or...

10:49.209 --> 10:50.250
No, it's nice.

10:50.250 --> 10:52.000
You good with that?

10:52.000 --> 10:53.334
All right.

10:53.334 --> 10:54.584
Morning, everyone.

10:54.584 --> 10:56.292
-Good morning.
-How y'all doing?

10:56.292 --> 10:58.167
I think we're gonna
start doing water sports.

10:58.167 --> 10:59.542
Great, great, fantastic.

10:59.542 --> 11:03.918
[belches]

11:03.918 --> 11:05.584
Do you guys wanna go and,
like, chill out for a minute?

11:05.584 --> 11:06.501
You guys good?
-Yeah, yeah.

11:06.501 --> 11:08.417
-Sure?
-Absolutely.

11:08.417 --> 11:15.250
I got this, I got this. Go chill
out for a minute, you guys.

11:15.250 --> 11:21.083
One, two, three.

11:21.083 --> 11:22.417
Where's Jess' radio?

11:22.417 --> 11:27.042
Hang on...

11:27.042 --> 11:28.667
Woo!

11:28.667 --> 11:30.125
Here you go.

11:30.125 --> 11:31.542
That was fantastic.

11:31.542 --> 11:34.292
Thank you, Rayna.

11:34.292 --> 11:47.501
I don't know why you
never respond to me.

11:47.501 --> 11:50.292
I'm not here to make friends,
I'm here to make money.

11:50.292 --> 11:52.042
But I'm also here
to work and have respect.

11:52.042 --> 11:53.209
Yeah.

11:53.209 --> 11:54.709
Like, I never did
anything to you,

11:54.709 --> 11:56.167
I've never said anything to you.

11:56.167 --> 11:57.542
I've only been kind.

11:57.542 --> 12:00.250
I don't know what
I deserved for that.

12:00.250 --> 12:01.375
Ah.

12:01.375 --> 12:02.751
I gotta pick my battles wisely.

12:02.751 --> 12:04.375
We're close to the end
of the season,

12:04.375 --> 12:06.042
but I just had to tell
someone that that sh--

12:06.042 --> 12:08.292
is so irritating to me.

12:08.292 --> 12:11.042
Bet you it's because of Jess.

12:11.042 --> 12:12.709
Good, be mad over nothing.

12:12.709 --> 12:18.083
No, I don't think it has
anything to do with that.

12:18.083 --> 12:22.584
Well, clearly you know something
that you're not telling me.

12:22.584 --> 12:33.083
She just, when we were in
the galley yesterday...

12:33.083 --> 12:40.083
That's what I gather it might
have something to do with.

12:40.083 --> 12:41.667
Interior, interior, galley.

12:41.667 --> 12:44.584
Go ahead.

12:44.584 --> 12:50.042
-Perfect, of course.
-Woo!

12:50.042 --> 12:51.626
Rachel, I need
to take 10 minutes.

12:51.626 --> 12:53.167
I'll be back on the
floor in just a few.

12:53.167 --> 12:54.459
It's so fun.

12:54.459 --> 12:59.292
Woo!

13:11.751 --> 13:14.209
Ooh, nice air on that one.

13:14.209 --> 13:16.751
Wow, thank you.

13:16.751 --> 13:18.209
Pleasure.

13:18.209 --> 13:19.751
Ooh set.

13:31.626 --> 13:32.667
Thank you, guys.

13:32.667 --> 13:34.250
-Pleasure.
-Of course!

13:34.250 --> 13:36.125
Pull everything in
and get the slide in.

13:36.125 --> 13:41.209
Let's frigging rock and roll.

13:41.209 --> 13:43.626
Yeah.

13:43.626 --> 13:44.709
Yeah.

13:44.709 --> 13:45.751
Did you have fun?

13:45.751 --> 13:51.417
-Yeah, I did.
-Good.

13:51.417 --> 13:55.292
I foolishly assumed that when
we had the conversation

13:55.292 --> 13:57.334
the other night
it was an apology

13:57.334 --> 13:58.709
and a promise to do better.

13:58.709 --> 14:00.250
Careful when you
say the N-word.

14:00.250 --> 14:02.042
What do you mean?

14:02.042 --> 14:03.375
I like you...
it's okay, I still love you.

14:03.375 --> 14:05.042
I can respect that, thank you.

14:05.042 --> 14:07.125
I got you.

14:07.125 --> 14:09.167
I don't know the right way
to handle this.

14:09.167 --> 14:11.501
I have never in my life

14:11.501 --> 14:15.667
wished for a time machine
more than I have now.

14:20.292 --> 14:26.584
Well, Heather's been
off the floor...

14:26.584 --> 14:28.417
There's too much going on.

14:28.417 --> 14:30.042
You don't have
to roll it so tight.

14:30.042 --> 14:32.417
Like a sausage!

14:32.417 --> 14:34.209
-Here you are, sir.
-That's perfect.

14:34.209 --> 14:44.167
And can I take your pressing
from you?

14:44.167 --> 14:52.501
Oh, no!
Oh, no!

14:52.501 --> 14:55.459
Oh, that's priceless.

14:55.459 --> 14:58.083
-Sick.
-Sick!

14:58.083 --> 15:00.292
So, I just wanna be sure

15:00.292 --> 15:03.459
if we're shooting
for a 6:30 dinner.

15:03.459 --> 15:06.626
Yeah, of course.

15:06.626 --> 15:09.125
And would you like to dine
on the inside dining room

15:09.125 --> 15:10.292
or the outside dining room?

15:10.292 --> 15:13.167
I don't care.

15:13.167 --> 15:15.459
Okay, beautiful.

15:18.584 --> 15:21.501
Talk about a sh-- sandwich,

15:21.501 --> 15:25.417
I have to get a new stew

15:25.417 --> 15:27.542
this vessel and only
for a couple of charters.

15:27.542 --> 15:30.125
I don't think there's
enough lipstick

15:30.125 --> 15:32.626
you could put on that pig
to make it appetizing.

15:32.626 --> 15:35.542
All righty, thanks a lot.
Bye.

15:35.542 --> 15:37.459
[sighs]

15:37.459 --> 15:39.375
Yeah, I think I need
to get out of the sun

15:39.375 --> 15:40.417
and lay down for a minute.

15:40.417 --> 15:48.000
I took a lot in today.

15:48.000 --> 15:58.709

-They're all good.

16:08.417 --> 16:10.167
-Primaries are down.
-I'll chat with you later.

16:10.167 --> 16:11.626
Okay.

16:11.626 --> 16:18.667
Can I give you a quick
little hug, though, madam?

16:18.667 --> 16:25.292
Aw!

16:25.292 --> 16:29.459
Yeah.

-Yes, you can borrow that.

-Thank you, baby.
-Mwah.

the trash out?

21:21.000 --> 21:22.584
I know she's my fiancé,

21:22.584 --> 21:24.334
but I'd like to make her
my girlfriend at some point.

21:24.334 --> 21:25.584
All right, good night.

21:25.584 --> 21:27.709
-Bye.
-Bye.

21:27.709 --> 21:28.709
How any hands do
you need for this?

21:28.709 --> 21:29.792
All of them.

21:29.792 --> 21:31.209
I'll call Eddie real quick.

21:31.209 --> 21:32.501
Is that bloody?
Like, is it deep?

21:32.501 --> 21:35.250
-I don't really know.
-Okay.

21:35.250 --> 21:37.334
I'll be the first to admit
I may have

21:37.334 --> 21:39.250
too much of an ego
to ask for help.

21:39.250 --> 21:41.042
Can we get you, Wes,
and Rayna

21:41.042 --> 21:43.125
to help with the cloches
this next course?

21:43.125 --> 21:44.209
Yeah.

21:44.209 --> 21:45.751
But I'm already 10 steps behind

21:45.751 --> 21:47.792
because Jess is
no longer with us,

21:47.792 --> 21:50.542
and my foot is just
bleeding everywhere.

21:50.542 --> 21:55.459
I just wanna keep
another volcano dormant.

21:55.459 --> 21:56.709
Wes and Jake,
you're gonna be

21:56.709 --> 21:58.751
helping with service,
so stay close.

21:58.751 --> 22:00.167
Yeah, copy that.

22:00.167 --> 22:04.626
This is steak,
polenta, mushroom.

22:04.626 --> 22:06.167
We're, like, literally,
like, one minute out.

22:06.167 --> 22:07.250
Okay, we're ready to go.

22:07.250 --> 22:09.334
Okay, I can start smoking now.

22:09.334 --> 22:12.167
We'll all lift up the
cloche at the exact same time,

22:12.167 --> 22:13.709
and then you're gonna
turn the cloche like this.

22:13.709 --> 22:16.667
These cloches are
very cloche to my heart.

22:16.667 --> 22:18.167
Let me tell you what...

22:18.167 --> 22:19.584
it was a cloche call
getting them here,

22:19.584 --> 22:22.083
because I ordered 12,
and 11 only showed up.

22:22.083 --> 22:23.792
I'm gonna go set primary.

22:23.792 --> 22:25.375
Okay, you can take that.

22:25.375 --> 22:26.792
Oh, wow.

22:26.792 --> 22:28.501
Yes.

22:28.501 --> 22:29.792
Wow.

22:29.792 --> 22:31.209
That looks amazing.

22:31.209 --> 22:33.834
Thank you, Rayna.

22:33.834 --> 22:38.584
On the count of three...
one, two, three.

22:38.584 --> 22:41.459
Wow.

22:41.459 --> 22:45.626
For your main course, you have
an Australian Wagyu strip loin.

22:45.626 --> 22:47.751
-Bon appétit.
-Thank you.

22:47.751 --> 22:50.542
Whoa, it's so pretty.

22:50.542 --> 22:56.709
-Very good.
-This is delicious.

22:56.709 --> 22:58.876
I like my steak medium-rare;

22:58.876 --> 23:00.792
maybe a little crispy
on the outside,

23:00.792 --> 23:03.709
on a plate, knife and fork.

23:03.709 --> 23:06.375
Preferably not
blended to a pulp...

23:06.375 --> 23:08.209
that's definitely
a waste of Wagyu.

23:08.209 --> 23:11.167
So, Chelsea, how long
do you need to keep...

23:11.167 --> 23:12.334
-Wear this for?
-Yeah.

23:12.334 --> 23:15.501
I have another four weeks.

23:15.501 --> 23:17.584
So, what type of an
emergency

23:17.584 --> 23:22.042
would warrant getting
out the wire cutters?

23:22.042 --> 23:23.792
-Yeah.
-Okay.

23:23.792 --> 23:26.626
High-five, thank you.
Love you guys.

23:26.626 --> 23:30.584
You're killing it.

23:30.584 --> 23:35.167
May I clear this for you?

23:35.167 --> 23:36.501
Amazing.

23:36.501 --> 23:38.792
-Down at 12:00.
-Good night. Bye.

23:38.792 --> 23:40.542
-Good night!
-Good night.

23:40.542 --> 23:50.667
-See you tomorrow.
-Good night.

23:50.667 --> 23:53.501
Yeah, oh, I would love that.

23:53.501 --> 23:57.334
I'm so excited!
I get to sleep.

23:57.334 --> 24:01.167
Lord, help me.

24:01.167 --> 24:03.626
Oh, God.

24:03.626 --> 24:05.292
-Hello.
-Hi.

24:05.292 --> 24:06.834
Great dinner,
they thoroughly enjoyed it.

24:06.834 --> 24:09.542
Thank you.

24:09.542 --> 24:11.292
I know, I'm falling
apart right now.

24:11.292 --> 24:13.834
You can go down and
be up at 6:00.

24:13.834 --> 24:15.334
All right, mate.

24:15.334 --> 24:16.667
I love you so much.

24:16.667 --> 24:18.125
Mwah.

24:18.125 --> 24:21.209
I'm so tired.

24:21.209 --> 24:22.542
Sally's standing
for you, Heather.

24:22.542 --> 24:25.083
-I love that!
-She's so proud of you.

24:25.083 --> 24:29.250
Good night, Larue.

24:29.250 --> 24:33.792
Get some ----ing rest,
because you need it.

24:33.792 --> 24:37.167
-Jake?
-Yeah?

24:37.167 --> 24:41.250
Oh, thanks, mate.
You're legend.

24:41.250 --> 24:45.667
It's just been one, long
----ing one-day sh-- show.

24:45.667 --> 24:48.501
The fact that she reiterated
it to him...

24:48.501 --> 24:50.292
----ing hell.

24:50.292 --> 24:53.083
Look, I have nothing but,
like, apologies and, like, hurt.

24:53.083 --> 24:54.751
Well, have you talked
to her yet about it?

24:54.751 --> 24:57.125
I will tomorrow.
This is not the time, you know?

24:57.125 --> 24:59.125
I just, like,
really upset myself.

24:59.125 --> 25:01.292
-That's understandable.
-Like, so embarrassed.

25:01.292 --> 25:05.167
It's extremely important to me
to clear the air with Rayna.

25:05.167 --> 25:09.167
I realize that I care a lot
about what people think of me,

25:09.167 --> 25:10.876
and I just couldn't
put the notion aside

25:10.876 --> 25:12.542
that she didn't like me.

25:12.542 --> 25:16.209
So, I wanted to relate
to her and have a moment,

25:16.209 --> 25:17.751
but the lesson here is yeah,

25:17.751 --> 25:19.334
it should never ----ing be said,

25:19.334 --> 25:21.667
regardless of my way
to create friendship.

25:21.667 --> 25:28.834
It was so wrongly done.

25:28.834 --> 25:29.834
Yeah.

25:29.834 --> 26:02.542
I'm so tired.

26:02.542 --> 26:11.125
[alarm sounds]

26:11.125 --> 26:13.584
-Morning, Wes.
-How you doing?

26:13.584 --> 26:16.626
Yep?

26:16.626 --> 26:27.167
Yes.

26:27.167 --> 26:44.209
Hey.

26:44.209 --> 26:49.292
No.

26:49.292 --> 26:50.459
No.

26:50.459 --> 26:52.417
Okay.

26:52.417 --> 26:55.209
He did?

26:55.209 --> 26:58.751
♪ I'll be

26:58.751 --> 27:05.167
I'm Wes, I'll be your
interior stew today.

27:05.167 --> 27:06.334
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

27:06.334 --> 27:09.250
French press coffee pot,
milk and sugar.

27:09.250 --> 27:18.375
I didn't know anything
else existed.

27:18.375 --> 27:19.542
Good morning.

27:19.542 --> 27:25.709
-Here you go.
-Thank you, Wes.

27:25.709 --> 27:27.167
Oat... got it, coming right up.

27:27.167 --> 27:29.334
-Heather.
-Yeah?

27:29.334 --> 27:30.584
Everyone's up!

27:30.584 --> 27:35.083
Holy sh--.

27:35.083 --> 27:41.751
Coming up...

27:41.751 --> 27:44.083
Listen, I might
have a little crush.

27:44.083 --> 27:45.751
Who wouldn't want
to date their best buddy?

27:45.751 --> 27:45.751
It's adorable and sexy.

27:45.751 --> 27:58.667
We've gotta go.

27:58.667 --> 28:02.501
Yeah?

28:02.501 --> 28:18.626
Holy sh--.

28:18.626 --> 28:20.417
Oh, you gotta
be kidding me.

28:20.417 --> 28:21.501
Did you wake them both up?

28:21.501 --> 28:22.751
I did!

28:22.751 --> 28:25.501
-Hey, bud.
-Hey.

28:25.501 --> 28:28.209
Good morning.

28:28.209 --> 28:32.751
Oh, wow, yeah, I just
woke everyone back up.

28:32.751 --> 28:34.834
Oh, God, I never thought
I'd be someone

28:34.834 --> 28:37.167
who would sleep in, ever
in my yachting career.

28:37.167 --> 28:39.584
Like, I'm starting to question,
like, am I good enough for this?

28:39.584 --> 28:42.375
Like, I shouldn't be
making these rookie mistakes.

28:42.375 --> 28:46.292
Ugh.

28:46.292 --> 28:48.709
No problem.

28:48.709 --> 28:50.459
We're gonna get out
of you guys' way.

28:50.459 --> 28:52.459
You guys are amazing.

28:52.459 --> 28:54.834
I don't know what happened
to my other pants.

28:54.834 --> 28:57.459
Oh, wait, there they are.
Hey, what's up, girls?

28:57.459 --> 28:59.501
A moment on your lips,
forever on your hips.

28:59.501 --> 29:02.250
This whole experience,
right, of this charter...

29:02.250 --> 29:04.417
Mm-hmm.

29:04.417 --> 29:06.459
...Is like doing anal
for the first time.

29:06.459 --> 29:08.292
Oh! Ow!

29:08.292 --> 29:13.751
You're trying to smile,
but all you feel is pain.

29:13.751 --> 29:15.918
And you're with someone
you don't wanna be with.

29:15.918 --> 29:17.417
Not you, the guests.

29:17.417 --> 29:19.250
I can give it,
but I can't receive it.

29:19.250 --> 29:20.792
I always stand with my feet

29:20.792 --> 29:22.542
and then go like
this to crack my back,

29:22.542 --> 29:24.417
and the whole thing
just went [trills tongue].

29:24.417 --> 29:32.501
-Ooh-la-la.
-Yeah.

29:32.501 --> 29:33.751
Just tuck those in
a little more over here.

29:33.751 --> 29:35.375
Maybe we're the other way round.

29:35.375 --> 29:38.501
-Let's see how tall you are.
-Is that right?

29:38.501 --> 29:40.709
It's...

29:40.709 --> 29:51.334
Welcome to the dark side.

29:51.334 --> 29:53.209
Guys, it's 9:00 a.m.

29:53.209 --> 29:55.459
Should we get to the table so
we can get our French toast?

29:55.459 --> 29:57.918
-It's French toast time.
-French toast.

29:57.918 --> 30:00.209
Oh, yeah, son of a bitch.

30:00.209 --> 30:01.626
French toast for you.

30:01.626 --> 30:04.292
Oh, wow.

30:04.292 --> 30:06.876
And some French toast
for Chelsea's angels.

30:06.876 --> 30:11.334
You are speaking my love
language now, Heather.

30:11.334 --> 30:12.584
Are you guys gonna be
joining Captain Lee

30:12.584 --> 30:13.667
on the bridge
when we go underway?

30:13.667 --> 30:15.167
Yes, yeah, thank you so much.

30:15.167 --> 30:18.334
Of course.

30:18.334 --> 30:19.334
Knock-knock.

30:19.334 --> 30:21.125
Come on in.

30:21.125 --> 30:24.626
Have you had any luck with
getting some stew résumés in?

30:24.626 --> 30:25.751
I'm working on it.

30:25.751 --> 30:27.501
Someone kinda comes to mind.

30:27.501 --> 30:30.292
My second stew
I work with in Florida.

30:30.292 --> 30:32.334
She knows the ethic that
I expect,

30:32.334 --> 30:34.542
so I feel like she'd be
the perfect person

30:34.542 --> 30:35.751
to just jump right in the mix

30:35.751 --> 30:37.542
and help us
finish out the season.

30:37.542 --> 30:39.125
Do you have a resume?

30:39.125 --> 30:40.542
I would love
to print that up for you.

30:40.542 --> 30:42.334
I'm open to anything that helps.

30:42.334 --> 30:44.083
A warm body that
can just flip the laundry

30:44.083 --> 30:46.417
and do the dishes.

30:46.417 --> 30:48.626
I trust Lee to
find me a replacement,

30:48.626 --> 30:50.501
but I'm the one
in the lion's den here.

30:50.501 --> 30:53.834
Kaylee's a very
go-with-the-flow, kick-ass

30:53.834 --> 30:56.501
second stew for me
from a previous vessel,

30:56.501 --> 30:58.709
and the devil you know is better
than the devil you don't.

30:58.709 --> 31:00.542
Look, I've got my department,

31:00.542 --> 31:04.167
you just handle
driving the boat.

31:04.167 --> 31:05.375
Yeah, get me her resume.

31:05.375 --> 31:07.209
-Okay.
-I'll take a look at it.

31:07.209 --> 31:09.584
I'm gonna be in the wheelhouse
during docking today.

31:09.584 --> 31:11.209
You're gonna be calling
in the distances

31:11.209 --> 31:12.751
from the two day markers.

31:12.751 --> 31:14.125
Yeah.

31:14.125 --> 31:15.501
And also the distances
coming in.

31:15.501 --> 31:16.584
We're pulling the anchor
in 10 minutes.

31:16.584 --> 31:17.584
-Go up there...
-Yeah.

31:17.584 --> 31:19.792
and prepare for hoisting, okay?

31:19.792 --> 31:22.083
-Yeah.
-Hey-oh.

31:22.083 --> 31:23.209
-Morning!
-Come on in.

31:23.209 --> 31:25.209
Morning, Captain.

31:25.209 --> 31:26.667
There's always
pressure with clients

31:26.667 --> 31:30.792
being right there
in the wheelhouse.

31:30.792 --> 31:35.501
Can't go, "He did it."

31:35.501 --> 31:36.751
Let's get ready to depart.

31:36.751 --> 31:41.167
Copy.

31:41.167 --> 31:43.083
Short stay, 9:00.

31:43.083 --> 31:45.083
He's giving me
the direction that the chain

31:45.083 --> 31:46.501
is leading, and a "short stay"

31:46.501 --> 31:49.042
means it's directly
alongside the boat.

31:49.042 --> 31:51.250
Short stay, 10:00.

31:51.250 --> 31:53.542
Anchor at the waterline,
you are good to maneuver.

31:53.542 --> 31:54.709
Roger that.

31:54.709 --> 31:56.375
Yay!

31:56.375 --> 31:59.834
We're underway.

31:59.834 --> 32:08.876
Nice job, Jake.

32:08.876 --> 32:10.792
Attention all crew,
attention all crew,

32:10.792 --> 32:12.626
I need everybody
in their whites.

32:12.626 --> 32:14.626
Let's go and get
into our whites.

32:14.626 --> 32:16.542
Okay, I'm just gonna put
some product in my hair

32:16.542 --> 32:21.667
so it doesn't look like
a four-year-old girl.

32:21.667 --> 32:23.125
All right, guys, heads up.

32:23.125 --> 32:24.459
We're on our final approach,

32:24.459 --> 32:26.125
so let's get ready
to pull it in.

32:26.125 --> 32:28.334
-Captain Lee?
-Yes?

32:28.334 --> 32:30.209
Have you ever had any
whales breaching near you...

32:30.209 --> 32:31.209
-Mm-hmm.
-while you were sail...

32:31.209 --> 32:33.459
You were out?
Ah.

32:33.459 --> 32:35.375
Will you be able to
do these ones as well?

32:35.375 --> 32:36.626
Because I've gotta
call the distances,

32:36.626 --> 32:37.667
and I don't wanna [bleep]
that up.

32:37.667 --> 32:39.667
I got you.

32:39.667 --> 32:41.542
Every time...

32:41.542 --> 32:44.083
It was blowing 10, 11 knots.

32:44.083 --> 32:46.250
Oh, Jesus Christ.

32:46.250 --> 32:48.042
Twenty-nine, 30.

32:48.042 --> 32:49.542
You know, you just
don't have a lot of room

32:49.542 --> 32:51.375
to work with when you come in.

32:51.375 --> 32:55.501
If you get off-kilter,
it gets expensive.

32:55.501 --> 32:59.501
All right, guys,
we can chuck the fenders over.

32:59.501 --> 33:01.834
Jeez-Louise, you feel that?

33:01.834 --> 33:03.501
Feel the wind starting
to blow the bow around?

33:03.501 --> 33:05.792
We are rolling.

33:05.792 --> 33:10.542
It's trying to tell me
it's got a mind of its own.

33:10.542 --> 33:16.209
The ----ing wind
is about 30 knots right now.

33:16.209 --> 33:19.709
I'm so ----ing terrified of
----ing up docking this boat.

33:19.709 --> 33:21.292
Forty feet, port side.

33:21.292 --> 33:23.584
There's a lot of
pressure on me, yeah.

33:23.584 --> 33:24.667
It's a bit ----ed really.

33:24.667 --> 33:25.667
About to hit the channel marker.

33:25.667 --> 33:27.584
Wow, that's tight.

33:27.584 --> 33:30.250
Thirty-five feet,
stern 50 feet from the dock.

33:30.250 --> 33:31.542
Oh, sh--.

33:31.542 --> 33:33.834
I have to rotate the boat
180 degrees.

33:33.834 --> 33:37.167
Thirty feet,
25 feet from the dock.

33:37.167 --> 33:38.667
Wind's coming on our stern,

33:38.667 --> 33:42.542
which is pushing us
into the dock and forward.

33:42.542 --> 33:44.375
Fifteen feet.

33:44.375 --> 33:46.167
You really have to stay focused.

33:46.167 --> 33:47.626
Have you ever had, like,

33:47.626 --> 33:50.417
when the mass of dolphins
are swimming with you?

33:50.417 --> 33:54.125
Never let 'em see you sweat.

33:54.125 --> 33:55.459
Ten feet.

33:55.459 --> 33:57.584
Come on, man,
please don't [bleep] up.

33:57.584 --> 34:04.792
Come on, come on, come on.

34:04.792 --> 34:06.334
Goddamn it.

34:06.334 --> 34:09.792
Midship, 70 feet from the dock.

34:09.792 --> 34:11.375
Come on, man,
please don't [bleep] up.

34:11.375 --> 34:13.375
Eddie, we're clocking
30 right now.

34:13.375 --> 34:18.334
-We're 50 feet from the dock.
-I need a better look.

34:18.334 --> 34:24.334
Forty feet from the dock.

34:24.334 --> 34:26.209
Fifteen feet from the dock.

34:26.209 --> 34:30.292
This line across?

34:30.292 --> 34:31.417
That's good.

34:31.417 --> 34:32.417
Thank you, gentlemen.

34:32.417 --> 34:33.709
And that's it.

34:33.709 --> 34:35.626
-That was impressive.
-Amazing, yes.

34:35.626 --> 34:37.459
Yes!

34:37.459 --> 34:39.167
That was pretty incredible.

34:39.167 --> 34:41.834
----ing hallelujah.
I'm a ----ing top geezer.

34:41.834 --> 34:46.250
Top geezer, fridge freezer,
lemon squeezer, Julius Caesar.

34:46.250 --> 34:47.542
[chuckles]

34:47.542 --> 34:48.792
That was so cool.

34:48.792 --> 34:50.250
Smooth, wasn't it?

34:50.250 --> 34:51.751
Oh, that was amazing
to share that.

34:51.751 --> 34:52.751
Yeah.

34:52.751 --> 34:54.167
Fabulous.

34:54.167 --> 34:55.792
I'm a little sad
to be packing up.

34:55.792 --> 34:57.292
You good?

34:57.292 --> 34:58.667
It's at a weird muscle
placement

34:58.667 --> 35:00.250
where I'm actually super
strong right here.

35:00.250 --> 35:01.667
Don't let me forget...

35:01.667 --> 35:04.501
her smoothie with alkalized
chocolate, coconut milk,

35:04.501 --> 35:07.626
berries, hemp seed,
all of that for protein.

35:07.626 --> 35:09.542
Oh, an easy one.

35:09.542 --> 35:11.167
You sure you're not
leaving anything behind?

35:11.167 --> 35:12.626
I know.

35:12.626 --> 35:14.834
All crew, get your hot asses

35:14.834 --> 35:18.375
to the main deck aft
in five minutes.

35:18.375 --> 35:20.375
It's already down here,
hot stuff.

35:20.375 --> 35:23.334
Come and get it.

35:23.334 --> 35:24.417
Got it?

35:24.417 --> 35:27.792
As soon as I get
my hands there.

35:27.792 --> 35:30.292
I had an awful time.

35:30.292 --> 35:31.709
-Oh!
-Sh--ty.

35:31.709 --> 35:34.584
Oh, come on, I'm a hugger.

35:34.584 --> 35:35.584
Bye, Sally.
I'm gonna miss Sally.

35:35.584 --> 35:37.209
Thank you.

35:37.209 --> 35:38.250
Thank you for everything,
it was so wonderful.

35:38.250 --> 35:39.626
You're welcome.

35:39.626 --> 35:41.250
We have two for you
to take to the hotel.

35:41.250 --> 35:43.751
Take your smoothies.
Then get the [bleep] out.

35:43.751 --> 35:45.667
I wanna thank you all
personally

35:45.667 --> 35:47.626
for your patience
and understanding.

35:47.626 --> 35:49.250
That was really heartfelt.

35:49.250 --> 35:51.792
And Rachel, thank you
for allowing me

35:51.792 --> 35:54.626
to participate in the meals.

35:54.626 --> 35:55.667
We only have gratitude.

35:55.667 --> 35:57.292
Thank you so much.

35:57.292 --> 35:59.250
-Lots of love.
-Thank you.

35:59.250 --> 36:00.542
-Take care.
-Be well.

36:00.542 --> 36:08.167
Let's go to work.

36:08.167 --> 36:09.751
Okay.

36:09.751 --> 36:12.459
Bitch is lookin' Thicciana.

36:12.459 --> 36:14.792
I've got no clean uniforms,
that's good.

36:14.792 --> 36:16.667
No, me neither.

36:16.667 --> 36:21.626
I smell like sweat
and desperation.

36:21.626 --> 36:23.375
This smells like old ass.

36:23.375 --> 36:27.542
Do you need a hand?

36:27.542 --> 36:32.584
♪ I deserve a beer

36:32.584 --> 36:34.542
Son of a bitch!

36:34.542 --> 36:36.792
Attention all crew,
attention all crew.

36:36.792 --> 36:39.417
I need everybody
in the crew mess ASAP.

36:39.417 --> 36:49.125
Copy for galley.

36:49.125 --> 36:52.000
I thought that charter
went extremely well.

36:52.000 --> 36:53.417
Jake, you stepped up.

36:53.417 --> 36:55.375
Your docking procedure
improved vastly.

36:55.375 --> 36:56.709
Thank you.

36:56.709 --> 36:58.542
I have to say thank you
for all stepping in

36:58.542 --> 36:59.876
when we were down a person.

36:59.876 --> 37:02.375
It's unbelievably appreciated.

37:02.375 --> 37:06.626
So, our tip was 22,000 total...

37:06.626 --> 37:08.250
$2,000 apiece.

37:08.250 --> 37:11.250
A little more, now that
we're short-handed.

37:11.250 --> 37:13.459
-Thank you, Captain.
-Thank you, Cap.

37:13.459 --> 37:15.459
I think you guys
deserve a day off.

37:15.459 --> 37:16.834
Sweet.

37:16.834 --> 37:20.417
So, you guys are gonna go
to a beach by boat,

37:20.417 --> 37:21.751
eat, drink, be merry,

37:21.751 --> 37:24.250
have a good time,
and enjoy your day off.

37:24.250 --> 37:25.709
Come back well-rested,

37:25.709 --> 37:27.584
because I plan on working
your little asses off.

37:27.584 --> 37:30.209
-Thank you.
-Thank you very much.

37:30.209 --> 37:33.250
I'm so excited to finally spend
some time with Jake

37:33.250 --> 37:36.167
outside of work and just chill,

37:36.167 --> 37:39.542
and joke around
and drink champagne,

37:39.542 --> 37:42.459
and hopefully have
a kiss or two.

37:42.459 --> 37:46.709
Okay.

37:46.709 --> 37:47.709
Yeah!

37:47.709 --> 37:49.334
Idiots.

37:49.334 --> 37:50.501
Wes, don't put any of
this in your pocket.

37:50.501 --> 37:51.501
Oh, no, no.

37:51.501 --> 37:52.959
I'm missing two more.

37:52.959 --> 37:55.209
All right, let's start
the wash-down.

37:55.209 --> 37:58.292
Taking all this beach stuff
apart from the party.

37:58.292 --> 37:59.459
Knock this out,
and we'll be done.

37:59.459 --> 38:00.667
Where are we at?

38:00.667 --> 38:01.834
Just start rinsing
all this off.

38:01.834 --> 38:02.834
Got it. Copy.

38:02.834 --> 38:05.209
Sick!

38:05.209 --> 38:06.501
So, do you think we'll
be lucky enough

38:06.501 --> 38:08.375
to get a stew before
the next charter?

38:08.375 --> 38:09.876
Hopefully.

38:09.876 --> 38:12.417
I just think it'd be nice
to have an extra person.

38:12.417 --> 38:14.292
I don't want an extra person.

38:14.292 --> 38:16.501
Bachelor's degree.
That's a little different.

38:16.501 --> 38:18.334
I just really hope
we've got someone

38:18.334 --> 38:20.417
who wants to be here and
wants to work hard.

38:20.417 --> 38:22.250
The only problem with getting a
new stew is you gotta train her,

38:22.250 --> 38:23.667
you gotta get her
familiar with the boat,

38:23.667 --> 38:25.417
all while we're in
the middle of service.

38:25.417 --> 38:26.959
Yeah, good point.

38:26.959 --> 38:28.584
We just need a minion
who knows how to follow orders

38:28.584 --> 38:30.292
and knows how to
follow through... that's it.

38:30.292 --> 38:31.959
I wish I had deckhands
like that.

38:31.959 --> 38:35.959
Shut up!

38:35.959 --> 38:42.584
All in all, pretty good.

38:42.584 --> 38:44.334
-Thank you, Chef.
-You're welcome.

38:44.334 --> 38:45.918
Here's some extra stuff
with, like, some sauce and,

38:45.918 --> 38:49.083
like, extra bacon for your
sandwiches and scheisse.

38:49.083 --> 38:51.375
Ooh!

38:51.375 --> 38:52.667
What are you looking for?

38:52.667 --> 38:53.626
Why... what's happening
with your face?

38:53.626 --> 38:54.709
I don't know.

38:54.709 --> 38:56.000
Well, that was a little...

38:56.000 --> 38:57.501
that was a little
difficult to eat.

38:57.501 --> 38:58.584
I'm trying to think
should I start

38:58.584 --> 39:00.209
on the other end
at that point.

39:00.209 --> 39:01.375
Should I eat it like a hamburger
or like a hot dog?

39:01.375 --> 39:02.709
-And it's, you know...
-Really?

39:02.709 --> 39:03.709
Smash it, then it will
kinda moisten the palate

39:03.709 --> 39:05.250
and then work your way down.

39:05.250 --> 39:06.667
-Oh, I like it, all right.
-There ya go.

39:06.667 --> 39:08.209
Go for the saucy bit
to moisten the palate.

39:08.209 --> 39:09.334
And then work your way down.

39:09.334 --> 39:10.709
-Yeah, yeah.
-Work it down.

39:10.709 --> 39:12.792
I've got something
repressed, don't I?

39:12.792 --> 39:21.626
Yes.

39:21.626 --> 39:23.542
Sick!

39:23.542 --> 39:25.709
-I'm comin' in hot!
-You're comin' in hot!

39:25.709 --> 39:28.125
Ugh.

39:28.125 --> 39:30.250
Sit down.

39:30.250 --> 39:33.417
One step closer
to my sack of salty nuts.

39:33.417 --> 39:34.417
Open your mouth,
see if you can get it in.

39:34.417 --> 39:35.709
Here's a test.

39:35.709 --> 39:37.959
-Go, let's go.
-Okay.

39:37.959 --> 39:40.626
Go higher, go higher.

39:40.626 --> 39:43.334
-You ready?
-Yeah.

39:43.334 --> 39:45.417
Gimme some loft.

39:45.417 --> 39:46.584
That's not loft.

39:46.584 --> 39:47.876
That's a Goddamn fastball.

39:47.876 --> 39:49.751
-What is "loft?"
-Loft means like this.

39:49.751 --> 39:52.167
Ready?

39:52.167 --> 39:54.876
Oh! Woohoo! Ow!

39:54.876 --> 39:56.250
Wes did it again!

39:56.250 --> 39:57.250
Ready!

39:57.250 --> 39:58.751
Oh!

39:58.751 --> 40:00.459
Nom, nom, nom!

40:00.459 --> 40:01.542
Yes!

40:01.542 --> 40:03.584
Nom, nom, nom!

40:03.584 --> 40:04.584
Yay!

40:04.584 --> 40:06.584
I am so tired.

40:06.584 --> 40:09.918
Ready to go to bed now.

40:09.918 --> 40:20.584
[snoring]

40:20.584 --> 40:22.375
Oh, my God,
it's such a nice day.

40:22.375 --> 40:30.375
Oh, my God.

40:30.375 --> 40:32.417
-Yeah, baby!
-Yeah!

40:32.417 --> 40:36.209
Yeah, baby!

40:36.209 --> 40:37.459
All of it?

40:37.459 --> 40:40.834
All of it.

40:40.834 --> 40:42.417
I don't know why
they clean my room

40:42.417 --> 40:45.292
and always forget
the wastebaskets.

40:45.292 --> 40:46.626
Is that what
you're deciding on?

40:46.626 --> 40:49.375
God, what...

40:49.375 --> 40:50.417
Oh, yes.

40:50.417 --> 40:51.792
All right, go, young man.

40:51.792 --> 41:00.375
-Thank you.
-Pleasure.

41:00.375 --> 41:01.918
Attention all crew,
your catamaran

41:01.918 --> 41:09.209
will be leaving from the dinghy
dock in 30 minutes.

41:09.209 --> 41:11.209
Right now? No.
But we can do it later.

41:11.209 --> 41:13.501
I kinda wanna chat before any
drinks get poured, you feel me?

41:13.501 --> 41:26.292
Okay. Yeah.

41:26.292 --> 41:27.292
What's up?

41:27.292 --> 41:27.292
Um...

41:27.292 --> 41:33.751
Goddamn it.

41:33.751 --> 41:35.751
What's up?

41:35.751 --> 41:37.209
I just wanted to have
a quick chat with you

41:37.209 --> 41:39.375
before we have
an awesome day off.

41:39.375 --> 41:40.751
Most definitely.

41:40.751 --> 41:42.375
I can definitely feel
and sense

41:42.375 --> 41:43.375
that there's been
some tension between us.

41:43.375 --> 41:45.209
Okay.

41:45.209 --> 41:48.250
And I know that the other night,
when we were all hanging out,

41:48.250 --> 41:51.417
I said something
I really shouldn't have,

41:51.417 --> 41:53.459
and it wasn't right.

41:53.459 --> 41:54.667
And from the bottom of
my heart, I'm so sorry.

41:54.667 --> 41:56.542
I should have never said it.

41:56.542 --> 42:00.334
I just wanted you to know
that I'm not that person at all,

42:00.334 --> 42:01.834
and I really
just wanna apologize

42:01.834 --> 42:03.667
for that whole situation.

42:03.667 --> 42:05.542
That's why I've just kinda
been, like, distant.

42:05.542 --> 42:08.250
And I just feel like every time
I do try to get to know you,

42:08.250 --> 42:09.584
it just doesn't
feel like there's,

42:09.584 --> 42:11.792
-like, a genuine connection.
-Yeah.

42:11.792 --> 42:12.876
And, like, hopefully,
those walls can be broken...

42:12.876 --> 42:14.584
Yeah.

42:14.584 --> 42:15.918
And we can build something
that's actually genuine.

42:15.918 --> 42:17.209
-Of course.
-I appreciate the apology.

42:17.209 --> 42:19.250
I don't want you to feel upset.

42:19.250 --> 42:21.667
I just want us to, like,
move in a positive direction.

42:21.667 --> 42:22.751
-Do you know what I mean?
-Amen.

42:22.751 --> 42:23.834
I'm so sorry.

42:23.834 --> 42:24.918
Come here, come here, it's okay.

42:24.918 --> 42:26.584
Because you're beautiful...

42:26.584 --> 42:27.584
And I feel so awful
about it all.

42:27.584 --> 42:28.918
It's okay.

42:28.918 --> 42:30.209
Let's get the [bleep]
outta here.

42:30.209 --> 42:31.209
-Is it time to go yet?
-Yeah.

42:31.209 --> 42:32.792
----ing A.

42:32.792 --> 42:33.834
Let's ----ing kill it.
You get what I'm saying?

42:33.834 --> 42:36.167
That's all I care about.

42:36.167 --> 42:37.876
Goodbye, everybody.

42:37.876 --> 42:39.667
Oh, thank God.

42:39.667 --> 42:42.417
Do we have everything, you guys?

42:42.417 --> 42:43.834
Did anyone bring any sun cream?

42:43.834 --> 42:47.626
-Yes.
-I have some.

42:47.626 --> 42:51.083
I'm so excited!

42:51.083 --> 42:52.626
Hi, hi.

42:52.626 --> 42:53.918
Welcome aboard Falcon.

42:53.918 --> 42:55.417
You may have to
take your shoes off,

42:55.417 --> 42:57.584
or just change
to your boat shoes.

42:57.584 --> 42:59.292
Good morning.

42:59.292 --> 43:03.292
All right, who's drinking
rosé, my girls and boys?

43:03.292 --> 43:04.417
You wanna take the
front one off now?

43:04.417 --> 43:06.250
-Yeah.
-Nice.

43:06.250 --> 43:08.918
-Bye!
-Bye, Dad!

43:08.918 --> 43:10.250
Bye, Boat Daddy!

43:10.250 --> 43:14.375
Ah, that's much better.

43:14.375 --> 43:15.876
Yeah, sure, hell, yeah.

43:15.876 --> 43:18.209
Boat with sails,
oh [bleep] yeah.

43:18.209 --> 43:19.792
All right.

43:19.792 --> 43:21.542
I miss sailing.

43:21.542 --> 43:23.584
It recharges my battery and
creates that Zen moment.

43:23.584 --> 43:25.125
Any time we get off
the boat is great...

43:25.125 --> 43:26.918
away from Lee
and that ----ing slide.

43:26.918 --> 43:28.626
You're in your element
right now, aren't you?

43:28.626 --> 43:30.292
I really am.
This is all I wanted.

43:30.292 --> 43:32.125
This is all I ever wanna do.

43:32.125 --> 43:34.167
[blows whistle]

43:34.167 --> 43:55.459
-Yeah!
-Hey!

43:55.459 --> 44:02.501
Yeah.

44:02.501 --> 44:04.792
I know, it's great.

44:04.792 --> 44:06.459
Yeah.

44:06.459 --> 44:09.501
I definitely want a marriage
with a sh--ton of kids,

44:09.501 --> 44:11.417
so I've gotta start sooner
rather than later

44:11.417 --> 44:13.167
to form
my little army of Jakes.

44:13.167 --> 44:14.584
Can I get you girls a drink?

44:14.584 --> 44:15.584
I'll get you one.

44:15.584 --> 44:16.792
I ----ing really like Paris.

44:16.792 --> 44:19.584
If I was gonna marry
anyone, be her.

44:19.584 --> 44:21.667
Literally all this
distance from her

44:21.667 --> 44:29.751
is making the heart grow fonder.

44:29.751 --> 44:33.751
[snoring]

44:33.751 --> 44:35.209
Guys, this is unreal.

44:35.209 --> 44:36.751
This is awesome.

44:36.751 --> 44:41.918
Oh, my gosh, how cool.

44:41.918 --> 44:43.417
Stay outta the sun!

44:43.417 --> 44:46.876
That's what my mom
told me to do.

44:46.876 --> 44:49.125
All right, guys,
we're gonna head ashore now.

44:49.125 --> 44:51.417
And then you guys can make your
way down to Reggae Beach.

44:51.417 --> 44:53.959
It's over on that right corner.

44:53.959 --> 45:05.417
-Hope you guys have fun.
-Thank you.

45:05.417 --> 45:06.792
I'm gonna do conch
fritters for sure.

45:06.792 --> 45:07.792
Okay.

45:07.792 --> 45:11.417
Should we all just share?

45:11.417 --> 45:14.792
I've got coffee coming.

45:14.792 --> 45:16.834
Time off?
[bleep] yes.

45:16.834 --> 45:18.334
Let's do this sh--.

45:18.334 --> 45:20.542
Yes, oh, it's,
like, crushed, too.

45:20.542 --> 45:21.709
[bleep] yeah, winning.

45:21.709 --> 45:23.542
I'm not drinking today,

45:23.542 --> 45:25.751
so it's gonna be definitely
different than last season.

45:25.751 --> 45:27.501
Oh, my God, no, no, no.

45:27.501 --> 45:28.918
Sh--.

45:28.918 --> 45:30.751
I want some ----ing
dirty-ass sh--.

45:30.751 --> 45:32.459
Titties.

45:32.459 --> 45:35.792
With this crew being their
age, enjoy life, have fun,

45:35.792 --> 45:38.375
but this old lady
has gotta take a nap.

45:38.375 --> 45:39.584
I've got coffee, I'm excited.

45:39.584 --> 45:43.417
-Cheers, everybody.
-Cheers.

45:43.417 --> 45:44.584
Ai-yi-yi-yi-yi!

45:44.584 --> 45:46.918
Your chicken fingers.

45:46.918 --> 45:48.250
Thank you so much.

45:48.250 --> 45:49.459
Wow.

45:49.459 --> 45:51.584
Have you tried these?

45:51.584 --> 45:53.918
Where'd those assholes go?

45:53.918 --> 45:56.250
Cheers to our
amazing relationship

45:56.250 --> 45:57.876
that we have with
all three of each other.

45:57.876 --> 45:59.459
I love you guys so much.

45:59.459 --> 46:10.667
I'm so grateful that you
guys are in my life.

46:10.667 --> 46:12.292
Come on, answer the phone.

46:12.292 --> 46:14.292
The crew is amazing,
but honestly,

46:14.292 --> 46:16.459
sometimes I just feel
like I don't fit in.

46:16.459 --> 46:17.709
Dude.

46:17.709 --> 46:19.334
Rayna, don't seem too excited.

46:19.334 --> 46:20.334
Come on, answer.

46:20.334 --> 46:21.876
Goddamn it.

46:21.876 --> 46:25.209
So, I'm trying to still
drink and have a good time,

46:25.209 --> 46:27.209
but in a more
adult kind of way.

46:27.209 --> 46:28.375
Not the kids' way.

46:28.375 --> 46:31.501
[laughing]

46:31.501 --> 46:33.125
It's just not
my element, you know?

46:33.125 --> 46:35.250
Oh, this is so nice.

46:35.250 --> 46:38.250
I'ma watch from a distance.

46:38.250 --> 46:41.501
Ah.

46:41.501 --> 46:44.542
[snoring]

46:44.542 --> 46:45.584
Ah!

46:45.584 --> 46:47.751
[laughs]

46:47.751 --> 46:53.667
Ah!

46:53.667 --> 47:33.501
Yeah.

47:33.501 --> 47:34.751
Yeah.

47:34.751 --> 47:42.751
Yeah.

47:42.751 --> 47:44.501
If she wanted to apologize,

47:44.501 --> 47:45.501
she could have apologized
after this sh-- happened.

47:45.501 --> 47:47.125
Ah!

47:47.125 --> 47:53.167
I'm just over it.
Like, absolutely over it.

47:53.167 --> 47:53.167
Mmm...

47:53.167 --> 48:07.375
What's up?

48:07.375 --> 48:10.209
[snoring]

48:10.209 --> 48:23.292
Open!

48:23.292 --> 48:27.417
It's so nice to really
connect with someone.

48:27.417 --> 48:29.125
As I get to know Jake,

48:29.125 --> 48:30.751
I'm finding out there's
flirtatious banter there.

48:30.751 --> 48:32.209
It's not just buddy-buddy.

48:32.209 --> 48:37.918
It's adorable and sexy.

48:37.918 --> 48:39.751
Listen, I might have
a little crush.

48:39.751 --> 48:41.584
Who wouldn't want to
date their best buddy?

48:41.584 --> 48:43.751
But I understand
the facts here, so it's fine.

48:43.751 --> 48:46.417
[sighs]

48:46.417 --> 48:54.834
These ----ing assholes!

48:54.834 --> 48:58.209
That's some bullsh--.

48:58.209 --> 48:59.292
Are you watching this?

48:59.292 --> 49:00.334
What the [bleep] going on now?

49:00.334 --> 49:01.876
Is that Fraser and Jake?

49:01.876 --> 49:03.667
They're so cute.

49:03.667 --> 49:10.584
Oh, Rayna's going on
their date with them?

49:10.584 --> 49:12.667
Take your glass.

49:12.667 --> 49:13.834
Oh!

49:13.834 --> 49:15.918
Rayna!

49:15.918 --> 49:22.250
I'm going to get that.

49:22.250 --> 49:24.417
[bleep]

49:24.417 --> 49:27.209
Rayna's being a little bit of
a killjoy at this stage.

49:27.209 --> 49:30.834
Love you, mwah.

49:30.834 --> 49:37.667
She needs to back off,
get away from my man.

49:37.667 --> 49:46.751
Oh-ho-ho!

49:46.751 --> 49:52.876
Because they're nice.

49:52.876 --> 49:56.876
What the [bleep]
is that mother----ing thing?

49:56.876 --> 49:59.250
Oh, my God, oh, my God,
oh, my God.

49:59.250 --> 50:01.417
Ooh! Ooh!

50:01.417 --> 50:04.584
Ooh, ooh, ooh, oohhhh!

50:04.584 --> 50:06.584
Oh my days.

50:06.584 --> 50:08.501
Guys, do you wanna go
back to the boat?

50:08.501 --> 50:11.584
I'm ----ing tired.

50:11.584 --> 50:14.584
I'm ready to go to sleep.

50:14.584 --> 50:16.334
Why do you always
pull your dick out?

50:16.334 --> 50:18.667
It's Jake's dick o'clock.

50:18.667 --> 50:20.501
You have so much
sand in your bumhole.

50:20.501 --> 50:22.334
My head is about to explode.

50:22.334 --> 50:24.292
-Fraser.
-Fraser, be my daddy.

50:24.292 --> 50:25.459
Put it in!

50:25.459 --> 50:28.542
Jake, you're a pig.

50:28.542 --> 50:31.167
Going home.

50:31.167 --> 50:32.626
Jakie, who's it up to, you know?

50:32.626 --> 50:34.584
What the [bleep] do I
look like, chopped liver?

50:34.584 --> 50:37.250
Oh, Rayna's here.

50:37.250 --> 50:39.542
We'll be riding in
my van this evening.

50:39.542 --> 50:41.250
Please keep all heads and
arms inside the vehicle,

50:41.250 --> 50:42.584
unless your Jake and Fraser.

50:42.584 --> 50:47.292
Then, go ahead and
proceed to [bleep].

50:47.292 --> 50:53.751
Yep, yep.

50:53.751 --> 50:59.375
[whistling]

50:59.375 --> 51:00.584
If we don't get
outta this van soon,

51:00.584 --> 51:02.751
I'm gonna fart and
kill all of us.

51:02.751 --> 51:06.584
Let's rock and roll.

51:06.584 --> 51:08.209
Oh!

51:08.209 --> 51:12.125
Look at that fish,
look how big that thing is.

51:12.125 --> 51:13.626
I'm hiding from Rayna.

51:13.626 --> 51:16.584
Oh, man, look at this bed,
just ready to be laid in.

51:16.584 --> 51:28.792
Oh, it's me, hi.

51:28.792 --> 51:30.417
-Good night, man.
-All right, good night, buddy.

51:30.417 --> 51:34.417
See you in the morning.

51:34.417 --> 51:37.083
Eddie, every time I go out,
I make out with Rayna and Jake.

51:37.083 --> 51:39.209
-I think Rayna's jealous.
-She's so jealous.

51:39.209 --> 51:40.709
So jealous.

51:40.709 --> 51:43.125
I'm gonna try and get
a minute with Jake alone.

51:43.125 --> 51:44.501
Good luck.

51:44.501 --> 51:49.292
I'm not gonna work
too hard for this.

51:49.292 --> 51:51.083
Hey, babe...

51:51.083 --> 51:56.542
-Fraser.
-Fraser!

51:56.542 --> 52:06.417
They're in bed.

52:06.417 --> 52:13.250
Are they having a threesome
in Rayna's room?

52:13.250 --> 52:17.417
No, they're watching videos.

52:17.417 --> 52:19.334
Yeah, it is ----ing PG.

52:19.334 --> 52:22.334
They're laughing
and watching videos.

52:22.334 --> 52:34.876
Yeah.

52:34.876 --> 52:36.542
What are you doing?

52:36.542 --> 52:39.626
Oh, how's your threesome going?

52:39.626 --> 52:41.209
Excuse me?

52:41.209 --> 52:45.250
Jake, the ----ing pig,
is now ----ing Rayna.

52:45.250 --> 52:50.751
And I've got all this sh--.

52:50.751 --> 52:52.918
This thruple thing makes
me wanna throw-upple.

52:52.918 --> 52:54.959
What is going on?

52:54.959 --> 52:56.792
I'm confused.

52:56.792 --> 52:58.709
Maybe it's just because
I'm going through a dry spell,

52:58.709 --> 53:05.250
but I'm still confused.

53:05.250 --> 53:13.876
-Really?
-I'd put money on it.

53:13.876 --> 53:15.584
Next, on "Below Deck"...

53:15.584 --> 53:17.417
Tommy Thornton is our primary.

53:17.417 --> 53:18.834
Retired naval officer.

53:18.834 --> 53:20.459
Request permission
to come aboard.

53:20.459 --> 53:21.459
Permission granted.

53:21.459 --> 53:22.542
Thank you, sir.

53:22.542 --> 53:24.209
I really miss a pair of hands.

53:24.209 --> 53:25.751
Well, I just found
out we're getting my stew

53:25.751 --> 53:27.584
from my boat in Florida.

53:27.584 --> 53:30.542
I just worry that it's just
gonna disrupt the balance.

53:30.542 --> 53:32.459
-It's help or it's no help.
-I just don't know why...

53:32.459 --> 53:33.626
Yeah.

53:33.626 --> 53:34.751
That's ----ing bullsh--.

53:34.751 --> 53:36.667
-Need a hand?
-No, I got it.

53:36.667 --> 53:39.375
Eddie, why are you
washing down the skis?

53:39.375 --> 53:40.542
Because I'm here.

53:40.542 --> 53:42.209
I wanna see somebody
out there, Jake,

53:42.209 --> 53:43.209
helping you fuel those things.

53:43.209 --> 53:44.209
He wants you guys to do it.

53:44.209 --> 53:45.167
Don't screw up.

53:45.167 --> 53:53.417
It's... mm, okay.

53:53.417 --> 53:55.125
They'll get it right.

53:55.125 --> 53:56.667
They just told me she's allergic
to the shellfish.

53:56.667 --> 53:58.459
I'm about to
lose my sh--.

53:58.459 --> 54:00.626
In the future, we'd like
to eat dinner together.

54:00.626 --> 54:04.626
Just to you know,
I'm disappointed.
