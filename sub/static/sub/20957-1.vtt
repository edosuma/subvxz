WEBVTT

00:01.033 --> 00:02.456
Previously on Wynonna Earp...

00:02.459 --> 00:04.390
- What happened?
- You went wrong.

00:05.452 --> 00:07.719
Please! Shoot me!

00:07.721 --> 00:10.622
I can't end the curse unless I send
every single revenant back to hell.

00:10.625 --> 00:12.418
- Dolls?
- He defied a direct order

00:12.421 --> 00:14.559
from his superiors. That's treason.

00:14.561 --> 00:17.562
- He's a good man.
- He's a good liar.

00:17.564 --> 00:21.066
When we're out of range, tell control to
go in hot. Tomahawks, the whole shebang.

00:21.068 --> 00:24.035
Careful now. I'm outside
the Ghost River Triangle.

00:24.037 --> 00:27.253
- There are things out there too.
- Things that want to get in.

00:27.256 --> 00:30.775
- You ready?
- I'm ready for anything.

00:30.777 --> 00:34.446
Run!

00:34.448 --> 00:37.215
Doc, quick!

00:40.887 --> 00:43.455
Shit!

00:49.763 --> 00:51.623
You made it awful peevish!

00:51.626 --> 00:54.899
It was plenty peevish and headed
for your back when I shot it!

00:57.771 --> 00:59.938
Waverly!

01:05.692 --> 01:07.404
My hat! He's eating my hat!

01:07.407 --> 01:09.948
Yeah, 'cause that's
the takeaway here. Move!

01:11.000 --> 01:17.074

01:24.597 --> 01:27.398
We haven't formally met.

01:27.400 --> 01:29.934
I'm Wynonna.

01:35.234 --> 01:38.306
Wynonna Earp.

01:38.309 --> 01:40.038
You said you were ready for anything.

01:40.041 --> 01:42.439
Juan Carlo was right.

01:42.442 --> 01:45.016
More than just revenants flooding
the Ghost River Triangle now.

01:45.018 --> 01:47.418
- Wait, what's a Juan Carlo?
- And what,

01:47.420 --> 01:51.422
pray tell, is that?

01:51.424 --> 01:53.758
- Dead.
- What are we supposed to do with it?

01:53.760 --> 01:57.095
Simple.

01:59.098 --> 02:03.034
We use it to rescue Dolls.

02:36.300 --> 02:38.768
Yes, sir, but a full-scale
assault at this juncture

02:38.771 --> 02:40.274
will not be prudent
and will only draw more

02:40.276 --> 02:41.673
attention to the situation in Purgatory,

02:41.675 --> 02:45.343
not to mention the slaughter
of thousands. Yes, sir.

02:45.345 --> 02:49.347
Thank you, sir. Moody... sir.

02:49.349 --> 02:52.050
Your missile strike has been called off.

02:52.052 --> 02:56.285
And my demon?

02:56.288 --> 02:59.424
Dispatched.

02:59.426 --> 03:02.860
Wynonna goddamn Earp.

03:02.862 --> 03:05.259
Yeah, Earp has always
been hard to contain.

03:05.262 --> 03:08.632
Speaking of containment, your
transfer to Black Rock prison

03:08.635 --> 03:10.268
is set for 0600 hours.

03:15.808 --> 03:19.010
Get him out of here.

03:33.401 --> 03:37.285
You're saying Wynonna Earp was
Robert Bobo Swain's jilted lover

03:37.288 --> 03:40.270
- and he poisoned the entire town?
- To get her attention.

03:40.273 --> 03:44.728
See, Wynonna's not a flowers
and chocolate kind of a girl.

03:44.731 --> 03:47.361
D'you anticipate charging Earp
as an accessory after the fact?

03:47.364 --> 03:49.806
We're weighing the evidence,
considering our options.

03:49.809 --> 03:51.909
Thanks, Pam.

03:51.911 --> 03:55.513
So no parade down main
street in my honour then?

03:55.515 --> 03:59.617
I'd settle for a smoothie
and one sad stripper.

03:59.619 --> 04:02.687
Look, the town needed a plausible,

04:02.689 --> 04:05.421
non-supernatural explanation
for what happened.

04:05.424 --> 04:08.259
- And they already hate you, so.
- They really do.

04:08.261 --> 04:10.695
Earp, you may be the hero

04:10.697 --> 04:13.598
that Purgatory deserves...
You're just not the one it needs

04:13.600 --> 04:16.267
- right now.
- Big Batman fan, huh?

04:16.269 --> 04:18.269
Hell no. When that franchise

04:18.271 --> 04:21.372
lost Uma Thurman, they
lost Randy Nedley for good.

04:21.374 --> 04:24.942
- You truly are a monster.
- Well...

04:26.523 --> 04:29.559
I'm a monster who knows what
you sacrificed to save this town.

04:34.730 --> 04:38.523
- Don't get all emotional on me...
- No, Nedley, it's...

04:38.525 --> 04:40.158
It's that smell.

04:40.160 --> 04:43.528
Oh yeah, they found a
dead possum in the vents.

04:43.530 --> 04:45.883
They who?

04:48.356 --> 04:51.102
Hang on. Wait right there.

04:51.104 --> 04:54.405
Right.

04:54.407 --> 04:58.409
Black Badge showed up with the antidote,
then they stayed to clean everything out.

04:58.411 --> 05:01.512
They've got all of Dolls' shit?

05:01.514 --> 05:03.781
Well, I kept his mug.

05:05.851 --> 05:08.019
Deputy Marshall Dolls was
too smart and too stubborn

05:08.021 --> 05:10.688
to keep anything truly
important here anyway.

05:10.690 --> 05:12.790
Where did he sleep?

05:12.792 --> 05:14.792
Good question.

05:21.433 --> 05:25.336
I don't know, Waves. This is the
fourth motel room I've checked.

05:25.338 --> 05:28.806
Bingo. Found his shit.

05:28.808 --> 05:32.210
I'll grab what I can, meet
you back at the Homestead.

05:32.212 --> 05:34.912
Wow.

05:34.915 --> 05:38.684
Neat freak in the streets, chaos
in the sheets. Who would've guessed?

05:42.421 --> 05:46.154
What the portable travel lab...

05:46.157 --> 05:48.638
cross-dressing hell?

05:59.071 --> 06:02.273
Real slow. Or I call the cops.

06:02.275 --> 06:05.109
Also I am the cops.

06:05.111 --> 06:08.312
I mean, kind of. I
mean, technically I'm...

06:13.753 --> 06:16.154
Ah! Son of a Charlie horse!

06:31.537 --> 06:33.938
Joke's on you, bitch.

06:33.940 --> 06:36.507
Gun only works for me.

06:44.181 --> 06:47.321
- And I grew up with two sisters...
- Four brothers. Here comes the boom.

06:49.988 --> 06:51.465
What the hell are you doing in

06:51.468 --> 06:53.090
- my hotel room?
- Your hotel room?

06:53.092 --> 06:56.461
Like, you and Dolls'...?

06:56.463 --> 06:59.858
- You know X?
- X like in Xavier?

06:59.861 --> 07:02.633
Uh, yeah, he's my...

07:02.635 --> 07:04.869
I'm his... Wynonna.

07:04.871 --> 07:08.906
- What?
- Wynonna Earp, though?

07:08.908 --> 07:12.844
Weird.

07:12.846 --> 07:15.980
He never mentioned you. OK, well...

07:18.217 --> 07:21.385
You have amazing taste in underwear.

07:24.656 --> 07:28.059
My poor, brave baby.

07:28.061 --> 07:30.658
We sure do a lot of patching
each other up these days.

07:30.661 --> 07:34.959
Yeah, when there are so many other
things that we should be doing.

07:43.008 --> 07:45.877
Ah! Sorry. Still tender.

07:45.879 --> 07:49.213
- Hey, Waves...
- What?

07:49.215 --> 07:51.415
You taste...

07:51.417 --> 07:53.618
different.

07:55.404 --> 07:59.524
Ahem! I'm just here for the
sweet tea, in the kitchen.

07:59.526 --> 08:02.727
I am now in the kitchen...

08:02.729 --> 08:05.496
When did you become such a prude, huh?

08:05.498 --> 08:06.713
Didn't you own a brothel?

08:06.716 --> 08:09.433
It was a bordello, and it
is called being a gentleman.

08:09.435 --> 08:12.436
Well, I appreciate it, Henry.

08:12.438 --> 08:15.406
I'm gonna go. Feed the cat.

08:15.408 --> 08:17.917
- I'll see you later.
- Officer Haught.

08:19.978 --> 08:22.300
- She's a lovely girl.
- Yeah,

08:22.303 --> 08:24.448
which makes me the luckiest.

08:24.450 --> 08:26.490
What about the rest of
it? How are you holding up?

08:28.097 --> 08:31.255
You know, I don't think
Wynonna's even sat down since...

08:31.257 --> 08:33.558
I'm worried about her.

08:33.559 --> 08:36.092
As am I.

08:36.095 --> 08:40.131
But I was asking more particularly
about yourself, Waverly.

08:40.133 --> 08:42.299
Willa was your sister too.

08:42.302 --> 08:44.802
I feel fine.

08:44.804 --> 08:48.439
Yeah. Actually, I...

08:48.441 --> 08:52.476
- I feel strong.
- Well, good.

08:52.478 --> 08:55.246
That's good. And we both know

08:55.248 --> 08:56.904
Wynonna can handle herself.

08:56.907 --> 09:00.084
Hurts like a mother.

09:00.086 --> 09:02.887
Woman, it's just a bruise.

09:02.889 --> 09:04.755
I know.

09:04.757 --> 09:07.291
So how long have you
been, uh... staying here

09:07.293 --> 09:09.427
with Dolls? Was it with or...?

09:09.429 --> 09:11.629
- Few weeks.
- Weeks?

09:11.631 --> 09:15.433
You can't be Black Badge. You
couldn't sneak up on a corpse.

09:15.435 --> 09:17.297
And your holds are atrocious.

09:17.300 --> 09:20.171
I'll have you know I'm kind
of a big deal around here.

09:20.173 --> 09:22.039
I'm the Earp heir.

09:22.041 --> 09:25.309
Destined to fight
Wyatt's revenant demons.

09:25.311 --> 09:28.407
End a curse?

09:28.410 --> 09:30.448
I took you out with a lamp.

09:30.450 --> 09:34.051
Yes, and it was awesome.
But you know what,

09:34.053 --> 09:35.987
it doesn't matter,
because they took him.

09:35.989 --> 09:39.190
Black Badge.

09:39.192 --> 09:40.958
Said they're taking him to prison.

09:40.960 --> 09:43.634
Shit. Why?

09:43.637 --> 09:47.751
Because he defied their
orders. To help me.

09:50.701 --> 09:53.280
Xavier told me that if he was ever gone

09:53.283 --> 09:55.873
or didn't check in for 24
hours I should burn his files.

09:55.875 --> 09:59.143
- Did you?
- What am I, stupid?

09:59.145 --> 10:01.846
Besides, disgraced Black Badge agents

10:01.848 --> 10:06.050
don't go to prison.
They go to Black Rock.

10:06.052 --> 10:08.777
Dark ops, middle of the Baltic Sea,

10:08.780 --> 10:11.489
average life expectancy once
you get there is like two months.

10:11.491 --> 10:15.092
I'm not giving up on him.

10:15.094 --> 10:17.895
Then you're gonna need me.

10:17.897 --> 10:20.331
They won't transfer him right away.

10:20.333 --> 10:22.967
Any safe house they store him in...

10:22.969 --> 10:26.103
- I have clearance to get us inside.
- And I have a team.

10:26.105 --> 10:29.874
Look, Eliza,

10:29.876 --> 10:33.444
- if you care about Dolls...
- I do.

10:33.446 --> 10:36.681
Well, that makes two of us.

10:38.050 --> 10:41.786
- I'm in.
- Thank you.

10:41.788 --> 10:44.255
But you should prepare yourself.

10:44.257 --> 10:46.257
Not only is there a high chance

10:46.259 --> 10:48.793
of us getting dead, but
Dolls might already be.

10:48.795 --> 10:51.111
Or worse.

10:51.114 --> 10:54.131
What's worse than dead?

11:11.470 --> 11:13.106
All the files from Dolls' motel room and

11:13.109 --> 11:15.248
nothing on where they
might have taken him.

11:15.251 --> 11:17.078
The location of Black
Badge satellite offices

11:17.081 --> 11:18.666
are kept secret, even from one another.

11:18.668 --> 11:21.336
Makes it way harder to track
their movements, activities.

11:21.338 --> 11:24.605
- Paranoid much?
- And with good reason. Black Badge

11:24.607 --> 11:28.343
is so far off the government
grid they're sub-Atlantis.

11:28.345 --> 11:30.358
If you only knew the
stuff they were into...

11:30.361 --> 11:32.460
I do not believe we have met.

11:33.515 --> 11:36.751
Yeah, OK, this is Eliza,

11:36.753 --> 11:38.820
she is a friend of Dolls'.

11:38.822 --> 11:42.223
Dolls has a friend?

11:42.225 --> 11:44.959
- Oh, a "friend".
- Mercy me,

11:44.961 --> 11:46.784
how complicated.

11:46.787 --> 11:49.430
Yeah, OK, so this is my
sister Waverly and her...

11:49.432 --> 11:52.033
- Girlfriend.
- Nicole Haught.

11:52.035 --> 11:55.203
- And that's...
- John Henry. But you can just call me Doc.

11:55.205 --> 11:58.373
- As in Doc Holliday?
- Well now, that would be ridiculous.

11:58.375 --> 12:00.408
OK, so how do we spring Dolls?

12:00.410 --> 12:02.938
Well, Eliza, Doc and I need to find

12:02.941 --> 12:04.979
the latest coordinates from
the local BBD safe house.

12:04.981 --> 12:07.471
I can use my credentials,
but here's the thing:

12:07.474 --> 12:10.551
there are no guns allowed on site. Not
even their own security carries them.

12:10.553 --> 12:13.246
It's just plastic cattle
prods and baseball bats.

12:13.249 --> 12:14.145
Old school.

12:14.148 --> 12:15.464
Means we got a fighting chance.

12:15.467 --> 12:17.925
- They'll have metal detectors.
- We'll adjust. Waverly,

12:17.927 --> 12:21.538
there are still 62 revenants
out there trying to kill me.

12:21.541 --> 12:24.007
- Aw, you did math!
- I cannot believe

12:24.010 --> 12:25.569
I'm saying this, but
without Bobo keeping

12:25.571 --> 12:27.201
them in line, who knows
what they're up to.

12:27.203 --> 12:29.937
- Yeah, Bobo...
- Waverly can suss out

12:29.939 --> 12:31.102
the trailer park. She can go

12:31.105 --> 12:32.306
- with Officer Haught.
- Agent.

12:32.308 --> 12:34.409
- Yeah?
- No, it's Agent Haught.

12:34.411 --> 12:38.183
Dolls deputized me before
he... He did, right?

12:38.186 --> 12:41.315
- Indeed.
- Just... find out

12:41.317 --> 12:43.618
where the revenants have
gone. We need to make sure

12:43.620 --> 12:46.621
that they're... not regrouping

12:46.623 --> 12:50.491
or planning something. God, is
it hot in here or is it just me?

12:50.493 --> 12:52.693
Hey, can I...

12:52.695 --> 12:55.169
can I talk to you? Somewhere private?

13:01.736 --> 13:04.405
OK, when was the last time you slept

13:04.408 --> 13:07.186
slash ate slash applied deodorant?

13:07.189 --> 13:10.678
Did Bobo do something to you?

13:10.680 --> 13:14.982
Uh... don't deflect, I
hate it when you do that.

13:14.984 --> 13:18.356
Wynonna, listen, 24 hours
ago you shot our sister.

13:18.359 --> 13:19.854
Yeah, and it sucked.

13:19.856 --> 13:21.289
- She sucked.
- Hey.

13:21.291 --> 13:23.302
Not helping.

13:27.496 --> 13:29.497
I'm sorry.

13:29.499 --> 13:32.133
Listen, I need you to be OK.

13:32.135 --> 13:34.735
So why am I

13:34.737 --> 13:36.471
dragging you into this again?

13:36.473 --> 13:38.272
Because I love you?

13:38.274 --> 13:40.074
Because you couldn't stop me

13:40.076 --> 13:43.351
if you tried? Because
Dolls is my friend, too?

13:45.647 --> 13:48.716
Alright, we'll grieve when
we save him. I have a plan.

13:48.718 --> 13:51.953
OK? A real plan. I need you to listen.

13:51.955 --> 13:53.436
Hit me.

13:56.358 --> 13:59.350
This'd be a lot easier if I had a combo.

13:59.353 --> 14:02.897
80, 62, 88. Deputy Marshall
himself gave me the combination.

14:10.672 --> 14:14.542
Shit. This means Dolls isn't packing.

14:14.544 --> 14:18.346
But I am.

14:18.348 --> 14:20.882
- Guys?
- How long since his last dose?

14:20.884 --> 14:23.228
30 hours, give or take.
But it was a doozy.

14:23.231 --> 14:24.009
Guys.

14:24.012 --> 14:26.795
You figure Black Badge will
provide medication on their end?

14:26.798 --> 14:27.923
Not a chance.

14:27.926 --> 14:31.058
- What do they care if Dolls devolves now?
- Guys!

14:31.060 --> 14:34.295
What are you talking about?

14:34.297 --> 14:36.497
Deputy Marshall Dolls

14:36.500 --> 14:39.443
is many things. He's
stubborn, he's humorless,

14:39.445 --> 14:41.578
he's principled and he's strong.

14:41.580 --> 14:43.313
He's a good man.

14:43.315 --> 14:46.911
He's also not a man at all.

14:51.089 --> 14:53.657
- Hey now.
- Where is he?

14:53.659 --> 14:55.565
- Earp, c'mon.
- Tell me where they took him!

14:55.568 --> 14:58.534
Old Bread Factory on Cherry Brick Road!

14:58.537 --> 15:02.378
- Thanks.
- Wynonna.

15:02.381 --> 15:04.468
Hope you're up for some
dumpster diving. We'll need it.

15:04.470 --> 15:06.804
- Need what?
- One big dead possum.

15:14.520 --> 15:16.280
Credentials?

15:23.472 --> 15:25.968
What exactly are you transporting here?

15:25.971 --> 15:30.094
The last of the shit from Purgatory.

15:30.096 --> 15:32.162
Please exit the vehicle.

15:39.671 --> 15:42.172
We've had a rough day, ma'am.

15:42.174 --> 15:44.441
You know the drill.

15:44.443 --> 15:47.711
Christ, you smell like shit

15:47.713 --> 15:51.181
- rolled in shit.
- Language.

15:51.183 --> 15:54.618
If only, friend. It's a dead animal.

15:54.620 --> 15:56.787
- Long dead.
- Its junk was everywhere.

15:56.789 --> 15:59.701
We don't get to clean-up,
that smell's likely

15:59.704 --> 16:03.727
to linger round here for weeks.

16:03.729 --> 16:07.131
- We good to go?
- Fine, yes,

16:07.133 --> 16:09.097
get out of here.

16:26.743 --> 16:28.060
My.

16:28.063 --> 16:30.053
There's lots more where
that came from, Tex.

16:30.055 --> 16:32.222
I'm from Georgia, ma'am.

16:32.224 --> 16:33.991
Your head looks naked.

16:33.993 --> 16:37.045
Why are you sneaking around
if you have a security pass?

16:37.048 --> 16:39.763
I had to get up there to cut
the wire that disables the alarm.

16:39.765 --> 16:42.467
- No turning back now.
- Guess we're all in this together.

16:42.470 --> 16:46.370
Better nut up and
decide who you can trust.

16:53.978 --> 16:57.514
Dolls provided you guys with
guns I've never even heard of.

16:57.516 --> 17:01.418
- What is this, Russian?
- Yeah...

17:01.420 --> 17:04.655
We're not taking any guns.

17:04.656 --> 17:06.790
OK.

17:08.193 --> 17:10.928
Hey, you gonna be OK with this?

17:10.930 --> 17:13.564
You and I working side
by side for Black Badge?

17:13.566 --> 17:16.532
Hmm... having to stare
at your gorgeous smile

17:16.535 --> 17:19.336
and pretty French braid
around the conference table...

17:19.338 --> 17:21.905
Actually, I'm thinking of cutting it.

17:21.906 --> 17:23.674
Think I'll manage.

17:23.675 --> 17:25.675
I don't know what we're gonna find

17:25.678 --> 17:27.886
at that trailer park. All
I know is with Bobo gone,

17:27.888 --> 17:31.682
these revenants are gonna be desperate.

17:31.684 --> 17:33.417
And desperate things

17:33.419 --> 17:36.453
make desperate decisions.

17:36.455 --> 17:39.330
- We're not going to the trailer park.
- What is this?

17:39.333 --> 17:42.879
This, Nicole, is for the greater good.

17:51.258 --> 17:52.501
What?

17:52.503 --> 17:55.337
OK, if you want me to trust you,

17:55.339 --> 17:57.339
you've gotta tell me the plan.

17:57.341 --> 17:59.708
Preferably before I find you
holding an axe over my head.

17:59.710 --> 18:01.998
Wynonna made me promise not to.

18:02.001 --> 18:04.329
She's my sister, Nicole.

18:04.332 --> 18:07.416
I have to protect her
now more than ever.

18:07.418 --> 18:11.587
Hey... just like I need to protect you.

18:11.589 --> 18:15.224
Yeah. OK.

18:15.226 --> 18:17.388
I just...

18:17.391 --> 18:20.414
I just wanna make sure
you're OK, you know, that...

18:20.417 --> 18:23.299
that deep down, you're
still... my Waverly.

18:23.301 --> 18:26.235
Totally. But first,

18:26.237 --> 18:28.704
will you help me be somebody else?

18:32.909 --> 18:36.245
- This is the door to the cells.
- How whimsically nautical.

18:43.881 --> 18:45.988
You backstabbing charlatan.

18:45.991 --> 18:48.019
- Son of a...
- Bitch!

18:48.825 --> 18:50.368
Yeah. One who set us up!

18:50.371 --> 18:53.262
No, I didn't, I swear!
Yes, they're onto us

18:53.264 --> 18:54.764
they've clearly revoked my security

18:54.767 --> 18:56.765
clearance-but this means
I'm as screwed as you!

18:56.767 --> 18:59.631
- I'll call in Plan B.
- What's plan B?

18:59.634 --> 19:03.836
Walking through the front
door, right about... now.

19:11.214 --> 19:15.017
Liz Wallis Windsor, Scotland
Yard. Here with the delivery?

19:15.019 --> 19:16.952
One ore daemonium?

19:16.954 --> 19:19.622
Jolly big mouth demon?

19:19.625 --> 19:23.628
Ah, of course.

19:29.667 --> 19:31.700
The shoes,

19:31.702 --> 19:33.847
don't forget the shoes.

19:33.850 --> 19:37.139
Thing is, there's no visit from
Scotland Yard scheduled in the log.

19:37.141 --> 19:39.792
Listen... I know the location

19:39.795 --> 19:42.978
of Black Badge safe house, I
have a stonking great demon head

19:42.980 --> 19:46.515
stuffed into a wheelie bag, and I'm due
back on a plane to London in three hours.

19:46.517 --> 19:49.652
It'd be one remarkably elaborate con,

19:49.654 --> 19:52.688
right, chap?

19:52.690 --> 19:55.696
Silver bullets. You want
to dig them up and see?

19:57.894 --> 20:01.530
Brilliant. Uh, laboratory?

20:01.532 --> 20:03.666
Left, right, right again.

20:03.668 --> 20:06.368
Marvelous. Toodles.

20:08.371 --> 20:10.739
- Toodles, really?
- It just slipped out.

20:10.741 --> 20:13.876
Waverly, that is the worst
British accent I've ever heard.

20:13.878 --> 20:16.612
- I improvised, OK?
- Stay safe in there, OK?

20:16.614 --> 20:19.481
Keep that getaway car running,

20:19.483 --> 20:21.684
Agent Haught.

20:21.686 --> 20:24.486
You don't gotta stay there and watch me.

20:24.488 --> 20:28.357
- I'm not going anywhere.
- Hm! That's not true.

20:28.359 --> 20:30.548
In a couple hours you're
going to Black Rock.

20:30.551 --> 20:32.595
And I'd like to be
the last person you see

20:32.597 --> 20:35.164
before they blindfold you.

20:38.935 --> 20:41.537
Well, well, Agent Shapiro.

20:41.539 --> 20:43.505
Eliza?

20:43.507 --> 20:46.575
- I told her not to come here.
- Guess she couldn't stay away.

20:46.577 --> 20:49.311
You did try to pull her
out of that fire fight

20:49.313 --> 20:51.847
- near Kabul.
- It was called triage.

20:51.849 --> 20:53.484
I couldn't save them both.

20:53.487 --> 20:55.788
- You left my husband to die.
- No.

20:58.588 --> 21:00.856
Greg told me to leave him.

21:00.858 --> 21:04.560
He knew he was bleeding out.

21:04.562 --> 21:06.562
He liked you.

21:06.564 --> 21:10.378
You've always been a
popular guy. And now,

21:10.381 --> 21:14.770
your friends are gonna pay for it.

21:14.772 --> 21:16.639
Wynonna?

21:16.641 --> 21:18.641
Doc?

21:22.285 --> 21:25.481
You know, they're uh...
they're not going anywhere.

21:25.483 --> 21:28.651
You stay put, OK?

21:28.653 --> 21:30.653
Lucado!

21:30.655 --> 21:32.821
Lucado!!

21:35.492 --> 21:38.514
Hellooo?

21:38.517 --> 21:41.630
Hello? Here to drop off a...

21:41.632 --> 21:43.432
Whoa.

22:05.656 --> 22:06.993
Oh, you guys

22:06.996 --> 22:09.692
already have one.

22:09.694 --> 22:11.994
A big one.

22:16.115 --> 22:17.833
Plan B here,

22:17.835 --> 22:20.269
good for eliminating all
unwanted problems quickly.

22:20.271 --> 22:24.073
- Oh, OK, that was inappropriate...
- Waverly, listen...

22:24.075 --> 22:27.144
- Yes, I have delivered the package.
- Why the full Middleton?

22:27.147 --> 22:29.712
And yes, I'm on my
way to the getaway car,

22:29.714 --> 22:32.147
far, far away from the danger.

22:32.149 --> 22:34.416
No, no, not that, nyet.

22:34.418 --> 22:38.654
Plan B, AKA you, needs to become Plan C.

22:38.656 --> 22:41.857
Tell me what you need.

22:41.859 --> 22:45.282
They're not gonna keep us in
here forever. I know it seems bad,

22:45.285 --> 22:48.063
but Dolls and I have been through worse.

22:48.065 --> 22:52.868
- He saved my life, you know.
- OK, we get it.

22:52.870 --> 22:55.504
You shared a hotel room, you
were obviously very close.

22:55.506 --> 22:59.408
C'mon, Earp. I had my own room.

22:59.410 --> 23:01.243
What?

23:01.245 --> 23:03.178
I just like to see you squirm.

23:04.920 --> 23:09.636
Look, we came all this way for
him. Just tell me what Dolls is.

23:09.639 --> 23:11.086
He's what Black Badge made him.

23:11.088 --> 23:13.381
Though they lied to him about that, too.

23:13.384 --> 23:16.024
That's why I was in Purgatory.
I was trying to help him

23:16.026 --> 23:18.394
find out what he... we are.

23:18.396 --> 23:20.329
What they did to us.

23:26.215 --> 23:28.604
There is a possibility
I am now hallucinating.

23:28.606 --> 23:31.206
- Jesus.
- Look, of course I know

23:31.208 --> 23:33.342
who you are, and what you are to Dolls,

23:33.345 --> 23:36.491
but even if your sister's successful,
there's a really good chance

23:36.494 --> 23:39.448
that Dolls won't be able
to control himself anymore.

23:39.450 --> 23:41.583
I'm prepared for that.

23:41.585 --> 23:43.819
And I'll take care of it.

23:45.703 --> 23:47.538
Though I was kind of hoping

23:47.541 --> 23:50.827
I could go 24 hours
without killing someone I...

23:50.830 --> 23:55.063
Pray tell, what exactly
is Waverly doing?

23:55.065 --> 23:58.901
So, in London,

23:58.903 --> 24:01.303
we have a R-500...

24:01.305 --> 24:04.273
Uh, do you mean the S-550?

24:04.275 --> 24:08.110
Right, yes. But I mean...

24:08.112 --> 24:11.980
your system is just... it's so...

24:11.982 --> 24:14.516
- Bollocks.
- Pardon?

24:14.518 --> 24:18.153
Yeah, I agree. The schematics suck.
Cellular monitoring is so buggy

24:18.155 --> 24:21.290
it gives malaria a good name,
the CMOS is 'mo' pathetic

24:21.292 --> 24:24.960
and the firewall's less likely
to show up to play than Kanye.

24:24.962 --> 24:28.430
He's an American rapper.

24:28.432 --> 24:30.737
I'm British, not elderly.

24:30.740 --> 24:34.536
No, listen, our system gives us trouble

24:34.538 --> 24:37.539
when it comes to opening
security doors...?

24:37.541 --> 24:40.676
You mean like...

24:40.678 --> 24:43.078
this?

24:43.080 --> 24:46.181
Can you open all of them simultaneously?

24:46.183 --> 24:48.450
Within the entire facility? Yeah.

24:48.452 --> 24:51.653
Option-J-3. Pretty basic stuff, mate.

24:51.655 --> 24:53.789
Not that you'd ever want to...

24:53.791 --> 24:56.091
Ah! Ow!

24:56.093 --> 24:58.460
What the hell?

24:58.462 --> 25:01.163
- We can't bleed in here!
- Why not?

25:01.165 --> 25:03.499
Because it'll smell it.

25:06.982 --> 25:08.357
That is a Hala,

25:08.369 --> 25:12.462
- a Bulgarian devourer of souls. It's mean.
- And very mad.

25:12.464 --> 25:16.332
Real mad. OK, run!

25:16.334 --> 25:18.563
- Where?
- Here! No, forget it!

25:18.566 --> 25:19.869
No, no, no!

25:23.808 --> 25:26.943
Why did you hit me?

25:26.945 --> 25:29.232
OK, my name is Waverly, Waverly Earp...

25:29.235 --> 25:31.769
- What happened to your accent?
- I'm not with Scotland Yard.

25:31.772 --> 25:34.060
I'm here with my
sister and Doc Holliday.

25:34.063 --> 25:36.197
Doc Holliday? Are you high too?

25:36.200 --> 25:40.467
And some super fit secret agent,
all to rescue... all to rescue Dolls.

25:40.470 --> 25:41.592
- Dolls?
- Yes.

25:41.595 --> 25:42.625
Agent Xavier Dolls?

25:42.627 --> 25:46.296
Yes. Please. He's our
friend. Can you help us?

25:46.298 --> 25:48.431
Yes, OK.

25:50.000 --> 25:52.869
Here they come.

25:52.871 --> 25:55.438
No, this is something
else. You need to go.

25:55.440 --> 25:56.972
You must be yanking my va-Jane.

25:56.975 --> 25:59.042
These alarms are not
good news for Waverly.

25:59.044 --> 26:01.511
- I'm not leaving without Dolls.
- I'll get him out.

26:01.513 --> 26:03.636
They're already onto me. My
Black Badge days are over.

26:03.639 --> 26:06.449
Look, lady, cool it. I'm an Earp,
OK? I know when I'm being played.

26:08.887 --> 26:12.055
- You were saying?
- What are you doing?

26:12.057 --> 26:14.072
Pretty easy from this
side. I just hit the button.

26:14.075 --> 26:15.258
Well, hit it again!

26:15.260 --> 26:18.515
- I'm coming with you!
- I will get him out.

26:18.518 --> 26:22.165
And if he is no longer the raging
asshole we know and respect,

26:22.167 --> 26:25.135
I shall take care of it.

26:25.137 --> 26:27.737
It's my turn, Wynonna.

26:27.739 --> 26:29.806
You've had enough.

26:29.808 --> 26:32.809
Was this your plan all along?

26:36.231 --> 26:38.499
Now go,

26:38.517 --> 26:40.717
save the sister you've got left.

26:40.719 --> 26:45.155
C'mon. The alarm's coming from the
lab. They'll take it right up there.

26:49.315 --> 26:52.529
OK, if we don't get some real
help, we're gonna get super eaten.

26:52.531 --> 26:55.632
- Devourer of souls, eh?
- Yeah, it's not just a cute nickname.

26:57.168 --> 26:59.302
Bring it!

27:10.648 --> 27:12.949
I thought you were
good in your underwear.

27:12.951 --> 27:14.901
You should see what I can do naked.

27:21.058 --> 27:24.994
- Deputy Marshall?
- Yeah, he's been demoted.

27:24.996 --> 27:28.231
You came alone? Curious.

27:28.233 --> 27:30.600
Foolish. But then again,

27:30.602 --> 27:33.083
you are the man who thinks he
can pull off that moustache.

27:33.086 --> 27:34.871
Aw, hell.

27:34.873 --> 27:37.774
Well, do you mind if I smoke?

27:42.880 --> 27:45.615
No guns allowed. At least
that's what they told me.

27:45.617 --> 27:48.551
Feels good to break the
rules every now and then, huh?

27:48.553 --> 27:51.754
Indeed.

27:51.756 --> 27:54.057
Dynamite is totally undetectable

27:54.060 --> 27:57.227
by your fancy metal wands.
And I should warn you:

27:57.229 --> 27:59.596
I was there when they
built the railroad.

27:59.598 --> 28:03.600
One stick's enough to blow a
rock face. Any face, really.

28:03.602 --> 28:05.301
If that stuff's as old
as it looks, it's...

28:05.303 --> 28:08.504
Terribly unstable. Doesn't
even need a lit fuse.

28:08.506 --> 28:11.140
You're gonna blow us all up? For him?

28:13.632 --> 28:15.378
You're insane.

28:15.380 --> 28:18.014
How do you like my moustache now?

28:21.119 --> 28:22.919
Run. I got this.

28:26.724 --> 28:28.925
Don't mind if I do.

28:28.927 --> 28:31.995
- You wouldn't.
- Kaboom.

28:31.997 --> 28:35.531
- I will shoot you.
- Kaboom.

28:38.669 --> 28:41.404
Now, say you're sorry.

28:41.406 --> 28:44.307
I'm sorry.

28:44.309 --> 28:46.976
Not to me.

28:53.851 --> 28:56.085
Don't kill her, Dolls!

28:56.087 --> 28:59.522
If you do, this will all be over.

29:05.763 --> 29:09.399
Whoa. Doc Holliday
lecturing me on ethics, huh?

29:11.102 --> 29:14.404
Whoa... What a difference a year makes.

29:15.873 --> 29:19.175
I don't think I can make it, though.

29:19.177 --> 29:23.313
Well, you'd better, or I'll
have two angry Earp sisters

29:23.315 --> 29:25.748
breathing down my throat.

29:27.751 --> 29:29.919
Where d'you get all this dynamite from?

29:31.420 --> 29:34.556
What happened to your hat?

29:37.160 --> 29:40.330
- We are not gonna make it.
- Well, then neither will they.

29:40.332 --> 29:42.665
I'll take my chances. What?

29:42.667 --> 29:44.667
Oh, God.

29:45.754 --> 29:48.604
OK. Shh, shh, shh.

29:52.343 --> 29:55.945
Hey, hey, hey!

29:55.947 --> 29:58.715
Take me! Devour my
soul! Just let her go.

29:58.717 --> 30:00.743
No.

30:00.746 --> 30:04.921
No one's getting devoured.
At least not today.

30:12.491 --> 30:15.201
Whoa, OK, what... what did you do?

30:25.576 --> 30:27.355
Not today, Satan.

30:33.720 --> 30:36.119
Are you sure you're not Scotland Yard?

30:36.121 --> 30:38.621
Plan B. When you don't have a choice,

30:38.623 --> 30:41.090
and you gotta get rid
of... Yeah, I hear it now.

30:41.092 --> 30:44.060
- Right?
- Are you OK?

30:44.062 --> 30:46.596
Who are you? You know what,
I don't care. We gotta go.

30:46.598 --> 30:49.799
- Wait, Dolls, where's Dolls?
- Doc's on it!

31:04.848 --> 31:06.783
Hey.

31:06.785 --> 31:09.352
You kept one.

31:09.354 --> 31:11.354
Yeah. No needle, though.

31:11.356 --> 31:13.356
OK.

31:13.358 --> 31:15.358
Don't need it.

31:23.667 --> 31:25.668
No time to be stingy.
You need enough to run.

31:36.848 --> 31:38.681
Can you please tell her?

31:38.683 --> 31:40.983
I will.

31:42.770 --> 31:46.189
- Dolls, you need to go!
- OK.

31:46.191 --> 31:48.191
Dolls, go!

31:49.259 --> 31:52.662
- We got 'em!
- Gentlemen.

31:52.664 --> 31:54.502
Ma'am. Damn,

31:54.505 --> 31:56.605
I do feel naked without it.

31:56.608 --> 32:00.136
- Hold... still!
- How do we get out?

32:00.138 --> 32:02.872
- We go down!
- What about me, what do I do?!

32:02.874 --> 32:05.708
- Ride or die, dude!
- OK, sure, yeah, no problem!

32:13.750 --> 32:15.751
Hey, Lucado. You look pissed.

32:15.753 --> 32:18.220
- Someone mess with your shoulder pads?
- No more bullshit.

32:18.223 --> 32:20.661
You failed, Earp. Say goodbye.

32:20.664 --> 32:23.292
No, no! Listen, just...

32:23.294 --> 32:25.294
Let them go. I...

32:25.296 --> 32:27.230
blackmailed them into it.

32:27.232 --> 32:29.031
I told them if they didn't help me, I...

32:29.033 --> 32:31.200
I don't even know this guy!

32:31.202 --> 32:33.736
- Jeremy, 'sup.
- Shut up!

32:33.738 --> 32:37.306
Tell you what: you can watch
the rest of them die first.

32:37.308 --> 32:39.760
- No!
- Ahem!

32:39.763 --> 32:42.245
Stand down, Agent Lucado.

32:52.315 --> 32:54.867
- Good. The gang's all here.
- Doc...

32:54.870 --> 32:57.727
It's nothing, darlin'. You
know how easily I bruise.

32:57.729 --> 33:00.596
Sir, I can explain.
These traitors tried...

33:00.598 --> 33:03.859
Oh, they did more than try.
Agent Dolls has gone AWOL.

33:03.862 --> 33:04.965
Yes.

33:04.968 --> 33:06.936
Doesn't make a lick of
difference in the end.

33:06.938 --> 33:08.809
- We'll find him.
- He doesn't deserve this.

33:08.812 --> 33:13.643
Well, Xavier used his one freebie to save
your little town from a nuclear mishap.

33:13.645 --> 33:15.978
You were going to bomb Purgatory?

33:15.980 --> 33:19.682
Seems you need to be reminded about your
use of contraband weapons in general,

33:19.684 --> 33:21.124
Agent Lucado.

33:29.242 --> 33:30.793
Now yours.

33:32.795 --> 33:35.999
You can pry Peacemaker
from my cold dead hands.

33:36.002 --> 33:39.308
I think I'll have one of
the boys here do that for me.

33:39.311 --> 33:43.803
So you brought your magic gun just
in case there was a demon attack, hm?

33:43.806 --> 33:46.097
I brought my magic gun to remind you all

33:46.100 --> 33:49.044
that I'm the goddamn
Earp heir and the only one

33:49.047 --> 33:51.230
who can send Wyatt's
revenants back to hell.

33:51.233 --> 33:54.050
I think revenants are the
least of your problems.

33:54.052 --> 33:57.019
Or haven't you seen any of the new
beasts that have flooded Purgatory?

33:57.021 --> 33:59.454
But yes,

33:59.457 --> 34:01.191
you will continue to patrol the Ghost

34:01.194 --> 34:03.614
River Triangle, and
you will do it on behalf

34:03.617 --> 34:07.029
of Black Badge. All of you.

34:07.031 --> 34:10.333
You can respectfully

34:10.335 --> 34:13.502
- kiss my lily white ass.
- Doc.

34:13.504 --> 34:16.871
I tried being a lawman. It didn't take.

34:16.873 --> 34:18.846
This is treason.

34:18.849 --> 34:21.393
And you're a dumpster
fire. Don't sign anything.

34:21.397 --> 34:23.431
- They're liars.
- What? Sign?

34:23.434 --> 34:26.849
Somebody has to pay, Moody! Soon.

34:28.195 --> 34:30.196
Someone will.

34:41.763 --> 34:45.431
I can't kill the heir,
but the rest of you

34:45.435 --> 34:46.878
are expendable.

34:46.880 --> 34:49.447
Got it?

34:49.449 --> 34:52.851
Agent Lucado, the contracts, please.

35:02.361 --> 35:04.262
Hey.

35:12.272 --> 35:15.340
You want us to sign in blood?

35:15.342 --> 35:18.202
It's how it's done. How
it's always been done.

35:23.610 --> 35:25.302
Who are you people?

35:25.305 --> 35:28.172
Really?

35:28.174 --> 35:29.782
Does it matter?

35:32.644 --> 35:35.079
- Don't talk to him any more.
- Oh...

35:35.081 --> 35:37.225
Cheer up, Wynonna.

35:37.228 --> 35:39.223
I'll sweeten the pot for you.

35:39.226 --> 35:41.686
You play ball, I'll help
you break the Earp Curse.

35:41.688 --> 35:44.699
I already know how to break it.

35:44.702 --> 35:49.193
Bobo Del Rey has been dispatched
and his revenants are all scattered.

35:49.195 --> 35:52.797
You'll never find and kill
them all, not in your lifetime.

35:52.799 --> 35:56.601
I'm being generous, Wynonna.
You deal with the dozen or so

35:56.603 --> 36:00.038
demonic horrors that got into
the Triangle when your sister

36:00.040 --> 36:01.838
opened the border,

36:01.841 --> 36:04.208
and could be we help you find a way.

36:04.210 --> 36:06.577
Lift your family's burden for good.

36:08.781 --> 36:10.815
Now get them out of my house.

36:14.011 --> 36:17.593
Oh, one more thing. Is there anyone else

36:17.604 --> 36:21.343
who knows about this mission?
About Black Badge's assignment

36:21.346 --> 36:24.262
- in Purgatory?
- Of course not.

36:24.264 --> 36:27.565
I swear on our mother's grave.

36:27.567 --> 36:30.835
Seriously, how stupid
do you think we are?

36:39.044 --> 36:41.579
He just... shot her.

36:41.581 --> 36:45.249
God, I hope Nicole got out.

36:45.251 --> 36:47.819
- Car's gone.
- Good.

36:47.821 --> 36:50.488
Good? How the hell
are we gonna get home?

36:50.490 --> 36:53.191
Doc...

36:53.193 --> 36:55.927
Did Dolls...

36:55.929 --> 36:57.995
say any... did he tell you to...

36:57.997 --> 37:00.665
- tell me anything?
- Not a thing.

37:02.291 --> 37:03.783
I'm sorry you had to re-up.

37:03.786 --> 37:05.736
I know how much you hate
being one of the good guys.

37:05.738 --> 37:08.506
I highly doubt those were the good guys.

37:08.508 --> 37:11.676
I finally got some dynamite
and didn't even get to use it.

37:28.026 --> 37:29.894
So...

37:29.896 --> 37:31.580
I'm not great at thank yous.

37:31.583 --> 37:35.500
You're still pretty great, though.

37:35.502 --> 37:37.568
I'm not sure he deserved it.

37:37.570 --> 37:40.638
Well, we so rarely get what we deserve.

37:45.444 --> 37:47.478
You could come in.

37:47.480 --> 37:49.547
I'm gonna take a shower.

37:49.549 --> 37:53.651
Well, then I'll leave you to it.

38:03.796 --> 38:06.364
I'm sorry I left.

38:06.366 --> 38:08.733
No. No, you had to.

38:08.735 --> 38:12.603
I wanted you to. Of course.

38:12.605 --> 38:15.006
I didn't have a choice, right?

38:15.008 --> 38:17.008
He would've killed you.

38:17.010 --> 38:20.011
Or made it official. Signed me up too.

38:20.013 --> 38:21.479
In your own blood?

38:25.175 --> 38:27.151
I better get back to the station.

38:27.153 --> 38:30.555
I've still got so much paperwork to do.

38:30.557 --> 38:33.224
Yeah, I... I best check on Wynonna.

41:00.950 --> 41:03.252
So, what do we do now?

41:03.254 --> 41:06.308
Find everything that got into the
Ghost River Triangle and kill it.

41:06.311 --> 41:08.891
So, the usual.

41:08.893 --> 41:10.972
- Sounds messy.
- Braving the winter

41:10.975 --> 41:13.539
while hunting demons in an
endless cycle of violence?

41:13.542 --> 41:16.441
Sounds fun.

41:16.444 --> 41:19.326
What about Black Badge?
God, they're scary.

41:20.972 --> 41:23.071
They should be scared of me.

41:25.275 --> 41:26.962
Forget Black Badge.

41:26.965 --> 41:30.445
Remember who the real enemy
is. Who we're really fighting.

41:30.447 --> 41:32.948
Demons.

41:32.950 --> 41:35.317
It's always demons.

41:41.337 --> 41:43.499
You know you don't have
to do this all alone.

41:43.502 --> 41:45.127
That's just it.

41:45.129 --> 41:48.564
No matter what they say, I
only really have one job now.

41:49.379 --> 41:51.618
Keeping my baby sister safe.

41:57.799 --> 42:00.342
C'mon, Earp.

42:00.344 --> 42:02.206
Let's go break a curse.
