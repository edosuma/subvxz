WEBVTT

00:11.424 --> 00:13.294
(sighs)

00:14.397 --> 00:16.834
Found a flip-flop!

00:16.867 --> 00:19.640
Don't need a flip-flop. I need a boot.

00:19.674 --> 00:22.480
I don't see any boots, babe.

00:22.512 --> 00:24.917
How do you keep losing shoes out here?

00:24.950 --> 00:27.690
I heaved the boot to disrupt a pair of lovemaking kitty cats.

00:27.723 --> 00:29.059
Male cat ran away.

00:29.093 --> 00:31.431
Then I felt bad, so I put on my flip-flops

00:31.463 --> 00:33.534
and went outside to check on the female cat.

00:33.568 --> 00:36.540
I wound up sitting there petting her for, like, an hour.

00:36.574 --> 00:38.712
And your flip-flop is still out here because?

00:38.745 --> 00:40.416
Male cat came back.

00:40.448 --> 00:42.686
Saw me touching his lady, he was pissed.

00:42.720 --> 00:44.523
I got scared. I ran back inside.

00:44.556 --> 00:46.393
Must have lost it then.

00:46.428 --> 00:47.730
Why do you keep getting involved

00:47.763 --> 00:50.135
in these situations with stray animals?

00:50.169 --> 00:51.570
I don't know, honey. Just bring me

00:51.604 --> 00:53.241
the flip-flop. I'll wear one of each.

00:53.275 --> 00:56.448
(animal squeaking on TV)

00:56.480 --> 00:58.785
What is that? I don't like that.

00:58.819 --> 01:01.557
I know it's not the bald guy with the birthdays.

01:01.591 --> 01:04.697
I found this channel with educational-ish stuff for Hope.

01:04.731 --> 01:08.904
NARRATOR: While most mongoose breeds work in cooperative groups,

01:08.939 --> 01:13.648
the Kenyan pygmy mongoose is solitary, working alone.

01:13.682 --> 01:16.553
You get to see all the beauty and wonder of the world.

01:16.588 --> 01:20.329
Watch here the extreme territorial aggression

01:20.361 --> 01:23.802
as this mongoose actually decapitates a rival.

01:23.835 --> 01:25.539
(mongoose screeching)

01:25.571 --> 01:26.573
(gasping)

01:30.581 --> 01:34.257
Great, they're both lefties. Now what?

01:34.290 --> 01:35.926
Honey, every morning this happens.

01:35.959 --> 01:38.231
If it's not a left boot, it's a right work glove

01:38.265 --> 01:40.601
or one lens from your sunglasses.

01:40.635 --> 01:43.574
How do you not keep pairs of things together?

01:43.607 --> 01:45.078
I don't know.

01:45.112 --> 01:46.848
(mongoose squeaking on TV) It's like a curse.

01:46.881 --> 01:50.189
What is that screeching from the living room?

01:50.221 --> 01:52.625
It's this show that scared Hope.

01:52.659 --> 01:54.830
It's about these Kenyan pygmy things.

01:54.864 --> 01:56.201
Pygmies freak me out.

01:56.233 --> 01:57.635
The women run around topless.

01:57.669 --> 02:00.142
They look like little girls with knockers.

02:00.174 --> 02:02.346
(gunshot) (gasps)

02:02.379 --> 02:04.583
Maw Maw!

02:04.617 --> 02:10.194
This house was becoming infested with pygmy mongooses.

02:10.229 --> 02:11.263
Give me that!

02:11.296 --> 02:12.666
Whoa-oa!

02:15.339 --> 02:17.643
Hey, there's my boot!

02:28.062 --> 02:29.131
Unbelievable!

02:29.166 --> 02:30.168
Save it, Jimmy.

02:30.201 --> 02:32.172
The last thing anyone wants to hear is a lecture

02:32.205 --> 02:34.309
about the dangers of gunshots in the house.

02:34.343 --> 02:36.347
Really? 'Cause I think the last thing anyone wants

02:36.381 --> 02:38.117
to hear is gunshots in the house.

02:38.150 --> 02:39.654
I'll buy a gun safe.

02:39.686 --> 02:41.558
But we are not gonna be one of those unarmed families

02:41.591 --> 02:44.329
that's unprepared for 2012.

02:44.363 --> 02:45.899
(hushed): Ah-ah-ah, shh. The boy.

02:45.932 --> 02:47.802
Shh.

02:47.836 --> 02:49.907
What's up?

02:49.940 --> 02:51.578
What's 2012?

02:51.611 --> 02:54.082
It's nothing. It's this crazy thing your mother heard

02:54.115 --> 02:57.690
from some nutty talk radio dude who's been inside a UFO.

02:57.722 --> 03:00.361
No, the UFO was inside of him.

03:00.361 --> 03:03.367
Dr. Sam says that in the year 2012,

03:03.400 --> 03:04.536
the planets are going to align,

03:04.570 --> 03:05.538
which will knock out

03:05.572 --> 03:08.311
the power grid, and then you'll need a gun

03:08.345 --> 03:10.349
because the angry hordes will be rioting in the streets.

03:10.381 --> 03:11.851
Why are the whores angry?

03:11.884 --> 03:13.187
Yeah, if the power's out,

03:13.220 --> 03:14.589
whore business probably skyrockets.

03:14.624 --> 03:16.927
You can scoff all you want,

03:16.961 --> 03:19.532
but we're talking about ancient wisdom here.

03:19.567 --> 03:23.040
The Mayan calendar only goes up to the year 2012.

03:23.073 --> 03:25.345
Yeah, well, my Hot Girls on Snowmobiles calendar

03:25.379 --> 03:26.447
only goes up till December.

03:26.481 --> 03:28.250
Does that mean the world's gonna end?

03:28.284 --> 03:29.587
No, just means

03:29.619 --> 03:32.225
my Hot Girls on Tractors calendar's on its way.

03:35.399 --> 03:38.772
No, no, don't let anybody scare you over a 2012 apocalypse.

03:38.804 --> 03:40.875
See? That's exactly what I was thinking.

03:40.908 --> 03:42.546
I mean when there are so many everyday things

03:42.579 --> 03:44.617
that could kill you. Right, exactly.

03:44.650 --> 03:46.219
Wait. What?

03:46.254 --> 03:48.692
People text while they drive through intersections.

03:48.725 --> 03:50.429
Radio waves messing up your brain.

03:50.461 --> 03:52.966
Hell, suburban mountain lion attacks are up 400%.

03:52.999 --> 03:54.936
Do you know how to fight a mountain lion?

03:54.970 --> 03:56.473
I don't.

03:56.507 --> 03:57.875
You can't fight a mountain lion.

03:57.909 --> 04:00.481
All you can do is lay back and go meet Jesus.

04:00.481 --> 04:03.220
Amen, sister. I guess all you can do is make up a will

04:03.253 --> 04:04.489
and hope you don't need it.

04:04.523 --> 04:05.993
Why would I make a will?

04:06.025 --> 04:07.395
I don't have anything valuable to leave.

04:07.429 --> 04:08.965
Because that's where you say legally

04:08.998 --> 04:10.534
who's gonna take care of your daughter.

04:10.569 --> 04:13.107
You didn't make arrangements for your daughter?

04:13.140 --> 04:15.778
I ought to swat that fanny.

04:15.812 --> 04:17.583
Please don't.

04:17.616 --> 04:19.652
I can't believe I'm spending a Saturday

04:19.687 --> 04:21.656
at a lawyer's office talking about death.

04:21.691 --> 04:23.260
Oh, sassafras.

04:23.293 --> 04:24.897
Don't think of this as a lawyer's office.

04:24.929 --> 04:27.301
Think of it as a pal's pad

04:27.335 --> 04:29.939
where we can just sit down and chill

04:29.974 --> 04:33.348
and sign legal arrangements for when you croak.

04:33.381 --> 04:35.685
(laughs) Sit, sit.

04:35.719 --> 04:36.953
I'll put on some jazz.

04:36.987 --> 04:39.959
And I have a great cheddar log with nuts.

04:39.993 --> 04:42.699
He does make the medicine go down easy.

04:47.443 --> 04:49.346
The main thing is, if I'm gone,

04:49.380 --> 04:51.851
I want to make sure that Hope is raised by these guys.

04:51.883 --> 04:55.291
Her other grandparents may get out of prison by then,

04:55.325 --> 04:56.593
and they're a little off-putting.

04:56.627 --> 04:58.798
That's the prison.

04:58.832 --> 05:00.601
Well, I'm a softie for convicts,

05:00.601 --> 05:03.272
but I don't fault you folks for being hinky.

05:03.308 --> 05:05.345
Now here's a fun one.

05:05.378 --> 05:08.282
Who will little Hope go to if all three of you die?

05:08.317 --> 05:10.955
Huh. That is a fun one.

05:10.989 --> 05:12.959
We hadn't thought about that.

05:12.993 --> 05:14.697
A lot of people haven't.

05:14.729 --> 05:16.298
Well, take your time.

05:16.334 --> 05:17.803
I'm on the clock.

05:17.835 --> 05:19.673
Son-in-law made me this for Kwanzaa.

05:19.707 --> 05:22.278
I think it's a hoot.

05:22.311 --> 05:25.518
Oh, and that is your actual bill.

05:25.551 --> 05:27.488
Oh! What?!

05:27.522 --> 05:30.494
So, who's your backup guardian?

05:30.528 --> 05:32.465
All right, think, think, think, think, think.

05:32.498 --> 05:33.333
Give me a minute. Give me a minute.

05:33.368 --> 05:34.904
Uh... Wait, wait, give me a minute.

05:34.937 --> 05:36.340
I can't think. Hang on.

05:36.374 --> 05:37.140
Wait. I know this.

05:37.174 --> 05:38.711
Uh... Wait. Hang on.

05:38.745 --> 05:41.350
Looking for a backup guardian.

05:41.384 --> 05:43.987
Ideally, someone under 50.

05:44.022 --> 05:46.494
We got to think of somebody to take care of Maw Maw, too.

05:46.527 --> 05:48.030
Well, there's no one on my side of the family,

05:48.062 --> 05:50.669
except my bitch skank whore cousin Delilah,

05:50.701 --> 05:52.739
who I'm not very close to.

05:52.773 --> 05:54.007
And if it's a package deal with Maw Maw,

05:54.042 --> 05:55.679
you can count out everyone on my side of the family.

05:55.711 --> 05:57.247
No one wants her.

05:57.281 --> 05:59.052
We even tried to donate her body to science,

05:59.084 --> 06:00.721
and science said no.

06:00.721 --> 06:02.758
(chuckles) No, we didn't.

06:02.793 --> 06:04.430
I know, but I thought of that joke, like, three months ago

06:04.463 --> 06:06.534
and I was just waiting for a time to get it in.

06:06.566 --> 06:09.607
That was perfect. It's funny, right? (chuckles)

06:09.639 --> 06:11.075
It's a little less funny knowing you've been sitting on it

06:11.109 --> 06:14.515
for so long, but, yeah, it's a good one.

06:14.550 --> 06:15.217
(meter dings)

06:15.250 --> 06:16.686
Oh, don't mind that.

06:16.721 --> 06:19.426
It just dings after every ten dollars.

06:19.460 --> 06:20.961
Oh. Oh. Um...

06:20.996 --> 06:22.733
Guys, we can do this. Concentrate.

06:22.765 --> 06:24.368
Okay, who do we know?

06:24.403 --> 06:26.273
(hiccups) Ooh!

06:26.305 --> 06:29.378
Sorry. I get the hiccups when I drink and I'm nervous.

06:29.413 --> 06:30.347
Look, do this.

06:30.380 --> 06:32.285
Put down "Sabrina."

06:32.317 --> 06:34.890
Sabrina? (scoffs) She's tiny.

06:34.923 --> 06:36.726
How's she gonna handle the terrible twos

06:36.761 --> 06:39.132
when Hope's big enough to wrestle her to the ground?

06:39.164 --> 06:40.769
He's just hoping if he puts her down,

06:40.801 --> 06:41.771
she'll like him more.

06:41.803 --> 06:43.040
You need to start thinking

06:43.073 --> 06:45.077
with your brain instead of your... (hiccups)

06:45.109 --> 06:45.779
(dings)

06:45.811 --> 06:47.247
Forty dollars!

06:47.280 --> 06:48.651
(exclaiming)

06:48.685 --> 06:51.221
Okay, okay, who else do we know?

06:51.255 --> 06:53.292
Javier, Marcus, Shelley? Who?!

06:53.326 --> 06:56.467
Chew it up and spit it into her mouth, baby-bird style.

06:56.500 --> 06:58.403
That's gross. It's not gross.

06:58.437 --> 06:59.371
(buzzer sounds)

06:59.405 --> 07:03.346
...43, 44, 45 to stay alive.

07:05.351 --> 07:07.387
One, two...

07:07.421 --> 07:08.990
(buzzer sounds)

07:09.024 --> 07:11.096
I'm off to my Zogland role-player's

07:11.128 --> 07:12.499
intergalactic war reenactment.

07:12.531 --> 07:14.802
If you ever want me to babysit on a Saturday,

07:14.837 --> 07:18.142
your daughter would make a great Molmee, the Child of Darkness.

07:18.176 --> 07:19.613
(buzzer sounds)

07:19.645 --> 07:22.685
Damn, Jimmy, she's gonna be hot, just like her mama.

07:22.718 --> 07:24.122
Let's see, when she's 17,

07:24.154 --> 07:27.194
I will be...

07:27.227 --> 07:28.564
(buzzer sounds)

07:29.633 --> 07:31.136
(buzzer sounds)

07:31.168 --> 07:33.406
I'm going with Sabrina Collins, final answer.

07:33.439 --> 07:36.814
Sabrina Collins it is.

07:36.846 --> 07:40.020
But we have more paperwork.

07:40.053 --> 07:41.856
Oh, man. Really?

07:41.891 --> 07:45.097
So, if you all die, Hope goes to Sabrina.

07:45.130 --> 07:47.467
If just Jimmy and Burt die,

07:47.502 --> 07:49.840
Hope goes to Virginia, right?

07:51.543 --> 07:54.347
And if just Jimmy and Virginia die,

07:54.381 --> 07:55.752
Hope goes to Burt. Yes.

07:57.689 --> 07:59.793
That's right. Uh...

07:59.827 --> 08:04.202
Virginia! Where's my green sock?!

08:10.981 --> 08:12.150
Virginia!

08:12.183 --> 08:14.690
Jimmy!

08:14.723 --> 08:17.696
Virginia!

08:17.729 --> 08:19.700
Jimmy!

08:19.733 --> 08:23.306
Virginia...!

08:23.339 --> 08:25.544
You know, you guys are unbelievable.

08:25.578 --> 08:28.316
After all this time, you don't have faith in me?

08:28.349 --> 08:29.552
Well, I'm gonna tell you something.

08:29.586 --> 08:30.989
I am a grown man.

08:31.021 --> 08:32.925
I could take care of Hope,

08:32.959 --> 08:35.899
and I can take care of myself.

08:35.932 --> 08:37.368
(buzzer sounds)

08:39.907 --> 08:41.376
Dad, wait.

08:41.408 --> 08:43.213
I can't believe Sabrina's ahead of me.

08:43.246 --> 08:44.514
She has skinny little hips.

08:44.549 --> 08:46.386
That's God's way of saying, "Don't have babies."

08:46.418 --> 08:48.824
Burt, how are you gonna take care of Hope alone?

08:48.858 --> 08:51.897
You can barely get yourself out the door in the morning.

08:51.931 --> 08:53.499
Hey, I'm awake for an hour

08:53.532 --> 08:55.404
while you're still dreaming of making love to me.

08:55.436 --> 08:56.874
And you're still dreaming of making love to some

08:56.907 --> 08:58.610
half-Sabrina, half-dolphin creature.

08:58.644 --> 09:00.581
Could you stop reading my dream journal?

09:00.614 --> 09:04.855
My point is lest he who be perfect pass the first stone.

09:04.890 --> 09:09.833
Every morning it's a whole production just getting you up.

09:09.865 --> 09:12.739
You two sleep in like a couple of princess Cinderellas.

09:14.743 --> 09:15.944
* Cinderella...

09:15.979 --> 09:18.015
Then I iron your work clothes for the day

09:18.049 --> 09:19.919
because you guys are so scared of getting shocked

09:19.952 --> 09:21.289
when the iron shorts out.

09:21.321 --> 09:23.525
(electrical buzzing, grunting)

09:23.560 --> 09:25.364
* That makes me feel good, outta sight *

09:25.396 --> 09:28.103
Then when the iron shorts out, I climb up to the attic

09:28.135 --> 09:29.471
and change the fuse

09:29.505 --> 09:31.577
because I'm the only one who even knows how

09:31.609 --> 09:32.779
to open the fuse box.

09:32.812 --> 09:34.582
Then it's phase two of Cinderella

09:34.615 --> 09:36.619
and Cinderfella.

09:36.653 --> 09:40.360
* I know what that's all about

09:40.394 --> 09:41.897
Clean all the ants out of the bathroom

09:41.930 --> 09:44.135
so Virginia's not freaked out when she brushes her teeth.

09:46.104 --> 09:48.575
Jimmy's gonna need to use the bathroom.

09:48.610 --> 09:50.948
So you gotta be out of here in 15 minutes.

09:50.982 --> 09:54.255
It takes as long as it takes.

09:54.288 --> 09:57.829
Then it's phase three for Cinderella

09:57.862 --> 10:00.667
and her knucklehead son Rip van Dingleberry.

10:00.701 --> 10:01.201
(Jimmy gasps)

10:01.201 --> 10:03.306
So all that's what happens

10:03.339 --> 10:05.744
before you bozos even get out of bed.

10:05.778 --> 10:07.481
I didn't know you did all that.

10:07.513 --> 10:10.587
None of us can even take care of ourselves

10:10.621 --> 10:12.191
let alone Hope.

10:12.223 --> 10:13.761
We're all idiots.

10:13.794 --> 10:14.930
Don't overreact, Jimmy.

10:14.963 --> 10:16.899
I think "idiots" is a little extreme.

10:16.934 --> 10:20.942
Guys, you left a little something back in the office.

10:20.975 --> 10:23.279
We're idiots.

10:26.954 --> 10:29.291
We can't even get out of the house

10:29.325 --> 10:31.697
in the morning without help. It's embarrassing.

10:31.729 --> 10:33.500
And Dad was mad at me that I put you

10:33.533 --> 10:34.869
higher than him to be Hope's guardian.

10:34.903 --> 10:37.206
Maybe I should put you above us all.

10:37.241 --> 10:38.810
(high-pitched voice): Whoa, back up.

10:38.844 --> 10:40.614
You put me down as Hope's guardian?

10:40.647 --> 10:42.317
You didn't ask if I wanted that.

10:42.351 --> 10:44.722
No one cares what you want, Sabrina.

10:44.755 --> 10:46.826
Just let me know how many people need to die

10:46.860 --> 10:48.496
before I get the baby.

10:48.530 --> 10:50.599
You're not on the list, Frank.

10:50.634 --> 10:53.773
So... how many people have to die before I get on the list?

10:53.807 --> 10:57.815
You know, a baby's kind of a lot to put on somebody unannounced.

10:57.848 --> 10:59.652
Hey, it's not like I'm hoping for this.

10:59.685 --> 11:01.321
It would happen, literally, over my dead body.

11:01.321 --> 11:03.459
Well know what? I just realized

11:03.492 --> 11:05.130
I can't have a baby and a python.

11:05.163 --> 11:06.365
You can keep him.

11:06.399 --> 11:07.702
Hope's a girl.

11:07.735 --> 11:09.504
Says you. Says nature.

11:09.537 --> 11:11.977
Let's just agree to disagree.

11:12.009 --> 11:13.478
Why did you even pick me?

11:13.512 --> 11:16.384
Well, I mean, everybody else I know stinks,

11:16.419 --> 11:17.888
and I love...

11:17.922 --> 11:21.194
how you don't stink.

11:21.228 --> 11:23.466
I'm sorry. I'm honored.

11:23.498 --> 11:28.476
It's just... a baby is a really intimidating responsibility.

11:28.508 --> 11:29.510
Well, yeah, but you'd be great.

11:29.545 --> 11:32.650
Look, I know I seem really cool and collected,

11:32.684 --> 11:35.490
but I am a basket case under pressure.

11:35.523 --> 11:37.729
I cried the first time I had to bag eggs.

11:37.761 --> 11:40.867
I comforted her with a warm embrace.

11:40.901 --> 11:42.905
Shut up.

11:42.938 --> 11:44.375
It was a bad day.

11:44.407 --> 11:46.779
All you need to do is spend some time alone with her,

11:46.812 --> 11:48.015
and get your confidence up.

11:48.049 --> 11:51.021
Okay. I'll take her out.

11:51.055 --> 11:52.891
But meanwhile, how about you and your family

11:52.925 --> 11:55.497
teach each other how to handle life on your own

11:55.530 --> 11:58.169
so I'm at least, like, number four on the list.

11:58.202 --> 12:01.441
I just realized I can train the baby

12:01.441 --> 12:03.612
and the python to be friends.

12:03.646 --> 12:06.385
I'll take your boy.

12:07.321 --> 12:09.525
Sabrina was right.

12:09.557 --> 12:11.796
For Hope's sake, for all of our sakes,

12:11.830 --> 12:14.168
we're going to teach each other how to survive.

12:15.904 --> 12:21.215
* What I want, you got, it might be hard to handle *

12:21.247 --> 12:23.553
* But like the flame that burns the candle *

12:23.586 --> 12:26.091
* The candle feeds the flame

12:26.125 --> 12:27.594
* Yeah, yeah

12:27.626 --> 12:30.032
* What I got's full stock of thoughts and dreams *

12:30.066 --> 12:32.036
* That scatter

12:32.070 --> 12:35.042
* You pull them all together

12:35.076 --> 12:37.046
* And how, I can't explain

12:37.080 --> 12:39.050
* Oh yeah

12:39.084 --> 12:41.756
* Well, well, you

12:41.790 --> 12:45.096
Ow. Stupid jerk bacon.

12:45.129 --> 12:47.501
Rule one: Don't cook shirtless.

12:50.005 --> 12:51.575
* Well, well, well you

12:51.609 --> 12:54.982
Rule two: don't cook eggs in the microwave.

12:55.015 --> 12:56.685
* You make my dreams come true

12:56.719 --> 12:59.425
* Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

12:59.458 --> 13:01.429
* Oh, yeah * Ooh, ooh

13:01.462 --> 13:03.065
* On a night...

13:03.099 --> 13:05.904
Rule three: you don't toast French toast.

13:05.938 --> 13:08.275
(electrical buzzing, groaning)

13:08.309 --> 13:10.981
I find the shock to be a bit of an energy boost.

13:11.014 --> 13:12.317
But you might want to bite down on this wooden spoon

13:12.349 --> 13:15.089
to keep from taking a chunk off your tongue.

13:15.123 --> 13:16.091
Hmm?

13:16.125 --> 13:18.128
* Wrap yourself around me

13:18.162 --> 13:21.468
* 'Cause I ain't the way you found me *

13:21.501 --> 13:24.108
* And I'll never be the same, oh, yeah *

13:24.140 --> 13:27.012
* Well, 'cause you

13:27.047 --> 13:28.950
(alarm beeping)

13:28.984 --> 13:31.154
(Maw Maw laughing)

13:31.188 --> 13:33.259
(laughing)

13:36.164 --> 13:37.434
(thudding)

13:37.467 --> 13:39.338
(laughing)

13:42.176 --> 13:43.813
Good.

13:43.847 --> 13:46.184
Look at us.

13:46.218 --> 13:48.623
We each got dressed and fed

13:48.655 --> 13:51.695
and out of the house without one bit of help or coaching.

13:51.729 --> 13:53.131
Wasn't that hard.

13:53.165 --> 13:55.035
I don't know why everyone else in the world

13:55.068 --> 13:56.873
makes it out like it's such a big deal.

13:56.907 --> 13:59.143
I don't think they do, Burt. It's just us.

13:59.177 --> 14:01.649
Well, I still think we've done a great thing.

14:01.681 --> 14:07.393
And it'll make our lives better, and our family stronger.

14:11.001 --> 14:13.072
(whispers): We're all gonna die.

14:20.353 --> 14:21.922
I'm going to make a run for the hatch.

14:21.957 --> 14:24.161
Don't! You'll never make it.

14:24.193 --> 14:25.763
We have to knock you out with cold medicine

14:25.797 --> 14:27.767
when you get a splinter, how are you going to deal

14:27.801 --> 14:29.570
with a pound of buckshot in your tushie?

14:31.140 --> 14:32.844
(shotgun blast, screams)

14:32.877 --> 14:35.583
(muffled yell)

14:37.888 --> 14:40.093
I can't believe I'm going to die.

14:40.125 --> 14:42.363
I've only had sex with one person.

14:42.397 --> 14:44.200
Me, too. Me, too.

14:44.233 --> 14:46.505
Six. Really?

14:46.538 --> 14:48.342
Yeah. Way to go, son.

14:48.375 --> 14:50.413
I don't believe it.

14:50.446 --> 14:51.916
Thanks for getting us into this mess.

14:51.950 --> 14:54.454
Wha... How is this my fault?

15:00.968 --> 15:03.539
Hey.

15:03.571 --> 15:05.043
You know, I-I don't think

15:05.075 --> 15:06.711
I need to hang out with her alone.

15:06.745 --> 15:08.582
The odds of you guys

15:08.616 --> 15:10.553
dying and needing me as a guardian,

15:10.585 --> 15:13.725
those chances are like, 5% at most.

15:13.758 --> 15:15.363
You're not just doing this for Hope.

15:15.396 --> 15:16.764
You might be a mom someday.

15:16.799 --> 15:19.538
So. You're going to need to be good under pressure.

15:19.571 --> 15:21.943
So go off, have fun, and just drop her off

15:21.975 --> 15:23.645
at day care when you're done.

15:23.678 --> 15:25.817
Relax. You're going to be great with her.

15:25.849 --> 15:27.587
I mean, what's the worst that could happen?

15:27.619 --> 15:28.755
A pit bull could eat her.

15:28.789 --> 15:31.761
Uh... hawk attack?

15:31.795 --> 15:33.099
Bee or jellyfish sting?

15:33.131 --> 15:34.668
Errant puck from a street hockey game?

15:34.701 --> 15:36.672
Baby-eating zombies.

15:36.705 --> 15:39.511
That last one was my attempt to lighten the mood.

15:39.544 --> 15:40.847
The other ones I'm seriously worried about.

15:40.879 --> 15:42.617
See you later.

15:43.619 --> 15:45.889
(stifled whimper)

15:45.923 --> 15:47.627
Hey, where's Hope?

15:47.660 --> 15:48.763
I made a funny face in the mirror,

15:48.796 --> 15:50.166
I wanted to show it to her.

15:52.036 --> 15:53.505
Uh, Sabrina took her, like, half an hour ago.

15:53.539 --> 15:54.976
(laughing) Oh, that is a good face.

15:55.009 --> 15:57.113
Oh, I bet she'd like it.

15:59.986 --> 16:01.921
You really going to abandon me in my time of need?

16:01.921 --> 16:05.462
I don't have time to help you find your dumb boot.

16:05.496 --> 16:07.200
It's a giant pain in the butt.

16:07.232 --> 16:09.438
Plus, that's what we put up your shelves for.

16:09.470 --> 16:12.010
I thought the shelves and stuff were for if you and Jimmy died.

16:12.042 --> 16:13.711
You know?

16:13.746 --> 16:15.016
So I'd have matching shoes at the funeral?

16:15.048 --> 16:16.784
I mean, we're still helping each other, right?

16:16.819 --> 16:18.122
I woke you up this morning.

16:18.154 --> 16:20.693
I-I wiped away the ants.

16:20.725 --> 16:22.130
At this point it is just stupid

16:22.162 --> 16:25.136
that you keep losing pairs of things.

16:25.168 --> 16:28.508
You'd lose one of your walnuts if your sack had a hole in it.

16:28.542 --> 16:29.443
(snickers)

16:29.478 --> 16:30.812
Well, I think it's stupid

16:30.846 --> 16:33.052
that you're afraid to iron your own clothes.

16:34.353 --> 16:36.325
Iron's especially zappy this morning.

16:36.357 --> 16:37.861
You want to tame that dragon?

16:37.894 --> 16:39.231
(electrical buzz) Daw! Jabberwocky!

16:40.266 --> 16:42.001
I'm not afraid of the iron anymore,

16:42.036 --> 16:44.074
because you showed us the trick.

16:46.211 --> 16:47.247
(electrical buzzing)

16:47.280 --> 16:48.948
(strained) Dragon tamed.

16:51.355 --> 16:54.493
Find your own boot.

16:54.527 --> 16:57.966
Fine. Everybody's on their own now.

16:58.001 --> 16:59.970
Not about everything.

17:00.005 --> 17:02.042
No, let's do everything by ourselves.

17:02.042 --> 17:03.545
We taught each other the skills,

17:03.579 --> 17:05.315
so I guess we're going Han Solo on everything.

17:05.348 --> 17:09.223
Which means you get to change the fuse when it blows,

17:09.257 --> 17:13.831
after starting the toaster while the iron is on.

17:13.866 --> 17:15.603
Good luck with the ironing.

17:15.636 --> 17:18.875
Good luck with your eggs.

17:21.414 --> 17:23.452
Good luck with your shirt.

17:29.130 --> 17:31.901
How do you do the fuse box latch again?

17:31.934 --> 17:33.304
Figure it out!

17:39.084 --> 17:41.288
Hey. Where the heck is Hope?

17:41.321 --> 17:42.723
At Shelley's.

17:42.757 --> 17:44.894
I was walking along, and I had this irrational fear

17:44.928 --> 17:46.298
that a tsunami was going to hit.

17:46.331 --> 17:48.802
And I'm not a very good swimmer, especially if I've got her,

17:48.836 --> 17:51.308
and it wasn't just a water tsunami, there were palm trees

17:51.341 --> 17:53.312
and hotels and convertible Sebrings,

17:53.345 --> 17:54.914
and here's where you need to slap me

17:54.948 --> 17:56.284
or shake me around to calm me down.

17:56.318 --> 17:58.288
Uh, okay?

18:01.928 --> 18:05.067
Oh, forget it.

18:05.102 --> 18:09.577
See? You were going to make her number three.

18:09.611 --> 18:11.882
(electrical buzzing, Virginia grunts)

18:11.915 --> 18:13.585
(thud from upstairs)

18:13.618 --> 18:16.290
Figure it out!

18:20.833 --> 18:22.570
What's wrong?

18:22.602 --> 18:25.475
I think I got a little shocked.

18:25.509 --> 18:26.977
FYI...

18:27.011 --> 18:30.084
you don't see your skeleton like in the cartoons.

18:30.118 --> 18:32.756
It just hurts.

18:32.790 --> 18:33.926
Very badly.

18:33.959 --> 18:35.296
Here, let me help you up.

18:35.329 --> 18:36.932
(gasps)

18:36.965 --> 18:38.469
Whoa. Not cool.

18:38.502 --> 18:39.938
Here, here. You need a hand?

18:39.971 --> 18:40.940
Yeah, yeah.

18:40.973 --> 18:43.979
Oh, way to go, Jimmy.

18:44.012 --> 18:46.250
You got bits of ceiling in my breakfast.

18:46.284 --> 18:48.087
I had to throw away a perfectly good omelet

18:48.121 --> 18:49.424
I made for myself.

18:49.457 --> 18:51.361
Probably had shells in it.

18:51.394 --> 18:52.964
I like shells in it.

18:52.997 --> 18:55.302
(shotgun blast, screaming)

18:57.507 --> 18:59.477
I hear you up there, mongooses!

18:59.511 --> 19:02.282
BURT (muffled): We are not mongooses!

19:02.282 --> 19:05.155
That's just what a mongoose would say.

19:08.896 --> 19:11.300
(whispering): We're all gonna die.

19:11.333 --> 19:13.372
I'm going to make a run for the hatch.

19:13.404 --> 19:15.308
(shotgun blast, screams)

19:17.412 --> 19:21.388
It's everyone's fault we're up here.

19:21.421 --> 19:23.057
A little more mine,

19:23.089 --> 19:24.660
'cause the gun safe I bought

19:24.694 --> 19:26.730
is still sitting in the back of my car, but still...

19:26.765 --> 19:28.034
we all helped get here.

19:28.067 --> 19:29.971
JIMMY: We screwed up our system.

19:30.004 --> 19:31.374
When we needed each other,

19:31.408 --> 19:32.910
it made us work together and be nice.

19:32.943 --> 19:35.182
And when we figured out how to do stuff alone,

19:35.216 --> 19:37.018
it turned us mean and vicious,

19:37.052 --> 19:38.821
to where we rip each other apart.

19:38.855 --> 19:40.825
It turned us into mongooses.

19:40.859 --> 19:43.030
Who would've thought being semi-helpless

19:43.064 --> 19:44.967
is half of what keeps a family together?

19:45.001 --> 19:47.973
Man, I bet families with blind people in them are really tight.

19:48.007 --> 19:49.210
You guys are lucky.

19:49.244 --> 19:52.650
Well, I mean aside from being held hostage and all that.

19:52.682 --> 19:54.254
Also, you have an obscene amount of beer.

19:54.287 --> 19:56.591
Oh, yeah. That's for 2012.

19:56.625 --> 19:59.329
I figured we wouldn't want to die sober.

19:59.364 --> 20:02.402
Which I guess applies to now as well.

20:02.402 --> 20:03.772
We're not going to die.

20:03.804 --> 20:05.609
We just have to not make any noise

20:05.643 --> 20:07.579
until Maw Maw falls asleep.

20:07.613 --> 20:09.883
Which is what, like, ten hours?

20:09.918 --> 20:11.120
We could do that.

20:13.792 --> 20:15.528
How much time do we have left?

20:15.561 --> 20:19.436
I'm guessing about nine hours, 40 minutes.

20:22.810 --> 20:25.248
MAW MAW (downstairs): Come on, mongooses, make a move!

20:25.281 --> 20:27.118
Let me know where you at.

20:27.152 --> 20:28.454
(loud hiccup)

20:32.430 --> 20:33.966
(loud hiccup)

20:33.998 --> 20:36.237
I hear your panicked cry.

20:36.271 --> 20:38.908
Keep it up, mongoose.

20:38.941 --> 20:41.079
Marco!

20:41.113 --> 20:42.249
(hiccup)

20:43.784 --> 20:45.589
(quietly) I'm so sorry.

20:45.622 --> 20:47.259
Marco!

20:47.293 --> 20:50.064
If all of us die, who raises Hope?

20:50.097 --> 20:52.303
We didn't make a fifth backup.

20:52.336 --> 20:54.407
It seemed unnecessary at the time.

20:54.439 --> 20:56.277
Marco!

20:56.311 --> 20:57.078
(loud hiccup)

20:57.111 --> 20:58.648
MAW MAW: Now I got you.

20:58.682 --> 21:01.388
Say good-bye, mongoose!

21:01.421 --> 21:02.522
We are not leaving Hope an orphan.

21:06.130 --> 21:08.267
(shotgun blast, scream)

21:09.536 --> 21:10.939
(yells)

21:10.972 --> 21:13.945
(gunshot)

21:16.984 --> 21:18.588
(coughing)

21:18.622 --> 21:20.090
You did it.

21:20.124 --> 21:22.094
You were great under pressure.

21:22.128 --> 21:25.502
Hey! I guess I was.

21:25.536 --> 21:27.138
Her skinny hips fit right through the rafters

21:27.171 --> 21:28.574
and saved our lives.

21:28.608 --> 21:30.845
You can put her as the guardian ahead of me.

21:30.879 --> 21:33.484
You can put her ahead of all of us.
