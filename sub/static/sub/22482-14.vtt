WEBVTT

00:01.802 --> 00:05.773
Hi. My name is Christy.
I'm an alcoholic.

00:05.806 --> 00:07.275
ALL:
Hi, Christy.

00:07.308 --> 00:10.711
And, uh...

00:10.744 --> 00:12.746
that's all I got.

00:15.349 --> 00:18.252
I think there's more.

00:18.286 --> 00:21.155
The plan was to be a lawyer, and
you guys supported me and said,

00:21.189 --> 00:23.324
"Oh, go for it, Christy.
You can do it."

00:23.357 --> 00:26.327
Turns out every law school
I applied to disagrees.

00:26.360 --> 00:28.362
And I can't tell you
how mean it was

00:28.396 --> 00:30.698
of all you people to make me
believe in myself.

00:30.731 --> 00:33.701
I don't know
how you sleep at night.

00:33.734 --> 00:35.503
So, thanks a lot.

00:37.571 --> 00:39.373
Still no.

00:39.407 --> 00:41.542
Anyway, for all of you who say,

00:41.575 --> 00:43.744
"Oh, sobriety's
full of miracles..."

00:43.777 --> 00:45.379
(blows raspberries)

00:46.680 --> 00:49.450
Sorry. I should end
on a positive note, so...

00:49.483 --> 00:51.485
(blows raspberries)

00:56.857 --> 00:58.259
Hi. Jill, alcoholic.

00:58.292 --> 00:59.660
ALL:
Hi, Jill.

00:59.693 --> 01:02.630
Well, transitioning back
to the real world

01:02.663 --> 01:05.266
has been really tough.

01:05.299 --> 01:07.868
Eating healthy was so easy
at the wellness retreat.

01:07.901 --> 01:10.271
I mean, carbs weren't allowed
on the premises,

01:10.304 --> 01:13.407
and I had a inner strength coach
on call 24 hours a day.

01:13.441 --> 01:15.643
It's just not the same

01:15.676 --> 01:17.545
FaceTiming her from
the frozen dessert aisle

01:17.578 --> 01:20.148
with a Sara Lee strudel
in my trembling hand.

01:22.216 --> 01:24.518
I mean, temptation's
all around me.

01:24.552 --> 01:27.355
Every time I open Google Maps,
it reminds me that I live

01:27.388 --> 01:30.724
three-eighths of a mile
from a Perkins Pancake House.

01:30.758 --> 01:32.893
And they're open all night.

01:32.926 --> 01:34.728
You know,
during those dark hours

01:34.762 --> 01:38.399
when you can't stop
your thoughts.

01:38.432 --> 01:40.268
Like right now.

01:40.301 --> 01:43.304
(ice cream truck music
playing outside)

01:45.906 --> 01:49.109
Wait, you all hear that
ice cream truck, too, right?

01:50.911 --> 01:52.413
BONNIE:
Hey, look at that.

01:52.446 --> 01:53.914
A spot right in front.

01:53.947 --> 01:56.317
That's what you get for
praying to the parking gods.

01:56.350 --> 01:57.585
The only god
you believe in.

01:57.618 --> 02:01.155
Not true. I also believe
in the lotto god.

02:03.557 --> 02:05.393
Son of a bitch!

02:05.426 --> 02:06.660
(horn honks)

02:08.396 --> 02:10.764
Little guy,
big motorcycle.

02:10.798 --> 02:12.800
BOTH:
Tiny wiener.

02:17.471 --> 02:20.308
Hey, buddy, we were here first.

02:20.341 --> 02:22.376
You were here first.

02:22.410 --> 02:24.412
You had an opportunity,
but you didn't take it.

02:24.445 --> 02:25.479
Lesson learned.

02:25.513 --> 02:28.416
Check it out, this Muppet
thinks I'm teachable.

02:28.449 --> 02:30.318
Miranda, you're here!

02:30.351 --> 02:32.520
Oh, Jill!

02:32.553 --> 02:33.454
You know her?

02:33.487 --> 02:34.822
Of course.

02:34.855 --> 02:36.890
She's my inner strength
coach from the retreat.

02:36.924 --> 02:38.892
Well, she's a dick.

02:38.926 --> 02:41.629
Oh, you must be Bonnie.

02:41.662 --> 02:44.832
Many people have heard of me;
you're not special.

02:44.865 --> 02:47.335
Thank you so much for coming.

02:47.368 --> 02:50.538
When one of my little lost
bunnies calls me, I'm here.

02:50.571 --> 02:52.806
Energy hug.

02:52.840 --> 02:55.276
(both humming)

02:55.309 --> 02:57.745
I'd like to stay and
mock whatever this is,

02:57.778 --> 02:59.413
but we still
got to park.

02:59.447 --> 03:01.615
Ah. Try around the corner.
I'll save you a seat.

03:01.649 --> 03:04.918
Hey, Bonnie, remember,
see the space, take the space.

03:04.952 --> 03:08.322
Hey, see my foot,
watch your ass.

03:08.356 --> 03:10.358
*

03:27.007 --> 03:28.509
Oh, my God, just having
you here, I feel safer.

03:28.542 --> 03:31.545
I think the donut dreams
are finally gonna stop.

03:31.579 --> 03:35.383
Jill, the only person that can
make you feel safe is you.

03:35.416 --> 03:36.950
What about a fireman?

03:36.984 --> 03:38.919
They always make me feel safe.

03:38.952 --> 03:41.489
Except when you fool around with
one of them in the supply closet

03:41.522 --> 03:43.457
and the next time
they bring in a burn victim,

03:43.491 --> 03:45.359
it's all, "Do I know you?"

03:47.027 --> 03:48.962
And how does that
make you feel?

03:48.996 --> 03:49.997
I'm used to it.

03:50.030 --> 03:51.965
Wendy, it's okay
to be angry.

03:51.999 --> 03:54.468
You have a voice and
we need to hear it.

03:54.502 --> 03:55.736
(quietly):
Okay.

03:55.769 --> 03:57.505
Try this.
(clears throat)

03:57.538 --> 03:59.307
I will be heard!

03:59.340 --> 04:02.009
(quietly):
I will be heard.

04:03.577 --> 04:06.447
Wow, she actually
got quieter.

04:08.482 --> 04:11.419
Turns out the closest spot
was the Home Depot parking lot,

04:11.452 --> 04:12.920
three-quarters of a mile away.

04:12.953 --> 04:16.424
I had to buy this
so they don't tow me.

04:16.457 --> 04:17.825
So, what did I miss?

04:17.858 --> 04:20.461
Miranda is helping
Wendy find her voice.

04:20.494 --> 04:22.663
You sure that's a fuse
you want to light?

04:22.696 --> 04:23.964
(loudly):
Hey, back off!

04:25.499 --> 04:26.934
There's Wendy the Lion.

04:26.967 --> 04:28.736
All right, give
me the hammer.

04:28.769 --> 04:31.305
Yeah.
That's probably smart.

04:31.339 --> 04:32.940
So, Miranda, tell us,

04:32.973 --> 04:35.008
what exactly do you do
at the retreat?

04:35.042 --> 04:36.744
Oh, it's simple, really.

04:36.777 --> 04:39.580
Everyone has an untapped
reservoir of strength,

04:39.613 --> 04:42.350
and it's my calling to help them
frack their way into it.

04:42.383 --> 04:44.818
Frack.

04:44.852 --> 04:46.787
That's wonderful.

04:46.820 --> 04:48.789
This woman saved me.

04:48.822 --> 04:50.524
I'd been at the retreat
for three weeks

04:50.558 --> 04:52.760
and only lost half a pound
when Miranda looked me

04:52.793 --> 04:54.094
straight in the
eyes and said...

04:54.127 --> 04:55.463
I see you.

04:55.496 --> 04:57.064
You do, don't you?
Yeah.

04:58.666 --> 05:00.734
She stood by my side
for the next 12 weeks,

05:00.768 --> 05:02.370
and bam, look
what happened.

05:02.403 --> 05:05.072
I'm back to being
the hottest one here.

05:05.105 --> 05:07.074
Jill, we talked
about this.

05:07.107 --> 05:09.009
Sorry.

05:09.042 --> 05:12.312
Everyone's beautiful in
their own peculiar way.

05:13.814 --> 05:14.848
Better.

05:14.882 --> 05:16.550
How is that better?

05:16.584 --> 05:18.719
It's important
for you to remember

05:18.752 --> 05:21.355
that you had the power
to change all along.

05:21.389 --> 05:23.391
I've been obsessing over
German chocolate cake

05:23.424 --> 05:24.925
with cream
cheese frosting

05:24.958 --> 05:26.960
and how it would
solve all my problems.

05:26.994 --> 05:30.931
Get out of your problems,
get into your power.

05:30.964 --> 05:33.601
I think I could do that
better back at the retreat.

05:33.634 --> 05:35.569
Aw, would that mean
Miranda has to leave?

05:35.603 --> 05:37.104
Oh, well, off you go.

05:37.137 --> 05:39.072
Jill, no.

05:39.106 --> 05:41.475
The Mindful Cactus
is a wonderful place,

05:41.509 --> 05:44.077
but you need to learn
to live in the real world.

05:44.111 --> 05:48.015
And in the real world,
cake happens.

05:48.048 --> 05:50.584
So I can have some?

05:50.618 --> 05:52.720
In moderation, sure.

05:52.753 --> 05:55.556
You have the power to take
a bite and push that plate away.

05:55.589 --> 05:57.991
Uh, yeah, Miranda,
we're not really

05:58.025 --> 06:00.961
a moderation
bunch of gals.

06:00.994 --> 06:03.997
(loudly):
I once drank floor cleaner.

06:06.066 --> 06:08.702
Give me the hammer.

06:12.440 --> 06:13.641
(sighs)

06:13.674 --> 06:15.108
You got to be kidding.

06:15.142 --> 06:17.044
What?
It's 4:30.

06:17.077 --> 06:19.480
Don't you have class?
Why bother?

06:19.513 --> 06:22.516
The world doesn't need another
college-educated waitress.

06:22.550 --> 06:24.885
"Let me tell you
today's specials

06:24.918 --> 06:28.055
and the difference between
Emily and Charlotte Bronte."

06:28.088 --> 06:30.458
Are those your teachers?

06:32.092 --> 06:34.728
Yes.

06:34.762 --> 06:36.063
I don't know
what I'm gonna do.

06:36.096 --> 06:38.065
All of my eggs were

06:38.098 --> 06:40.668
in this law school basket,
and I just dropped the basket.

06:40.701 --> 06:43.737
And that's why you don't put
all your eggs in one basket.

06:43.771 --> 06:45.939
I just got that.

06:45.973 --> 06:47.908
Maybe I need a Miranda.

06:47.941 --> 06:50.210
Hey, I'm your Miranda.

06:50.243 --> 06:52.446
Now snap out of it!

06:54.114 --> 06:57.551
Oh, look, there's that meatball
I dropped last night.

06:59.987 --> 07:02.690
Jill, you want to put away
your Elf on the Shelf

07:02.723 --> 07:04.157
and help me
clean up here?

07:04.191 --> 07:05.358
Careful, Bonnie.

07:05.392 --> 07:08.496
I'll have Santa put you on the
naughty list. (clicks tongue)

07:08.529 --> 07:10.030
I'll be right there.

07:10.063 --> 07:11.499
Talk to me, honey.

07:11.532 --> 07:13.701
It's the damn
cookie table.

07:13.734 --> 07:15.836
It's my turn to clean it,
but I'm afraid I'm gonna

07:15.869 --> 07:18.005
unhinge my jaw and
clean it with my mouth.

07:18.038 --> 07:21.942
Jill, do you know why
I started riding a motorcycle?

07:21.975 --> 07:25.145
Because I used to be afraid
of them, but I'm not anymore.

07:25.178 --> 07:26.847
You're right.

07:26.880 --> 07:28.982
I need to face my fears.
Come on.

07:29.016 --> 07:32.185
Let's do it together.
Okay.

07:32.219 --> 07:35.155
Oh, good God, where'd
those brownies come from?

07:35.188 --> 07:37.491
Relax, Jill.
Marjorie made them.

07:37.525 --> 07:40.193
(brownie clanks)
Hockey pucks with nuts.

07:40.227 --> 07:43.030
Just because things aren't
working out the way you want

07:43.063 --> 07:44.698
doesn't mean
they aren't working out.

07:44.732 --> 07:46.567
You just
got to have faith.

07:46.600 --> 07:49.637
I do. I believe
with all my heart

07:49.670 --> 07:51.605
that my life is
gonna suck forever.

07:53.240 --> 07:55.509
Hey, are you
sober today?

07:55.543 --> 07:58.178
(blows raspberries)

07:58.211 --> 08:00.080
Then you're a winner.

08:00.113 --> 08:02.249
See, you need to look
for small victories.

08:02.282 --> 08:04.117
Did you make your bed
this morning?

08:05.586 --> 08:07.721
I threw the bedspread
over the mess.

08:07.755 --> 08:10.257
I'm gonna put that
in the win column.

08:10.290 --> 08:12.259
I'm sorry,
I couldn't help overhearing,

08:12.292 --> 08:14.562
but you making your bed
is not a win.

08:14.595 --> 08:15.929
You need to aim higher.

08:15.963 --> 08:17.164
(chuckles)
Thank you, Miranda,

08:17.197 --> 08:20.100
but I've been helping people
work this program for 37 years.

08:20.133 --> 08:21.969
I think I know
what I'm talking about.

08:22.002 --> 08:23.971
Oh, I know
I'm just a guest here,

08:24.004 --> 08:27.675
but I have a teeny-tiny issue
with the first step of A.A.

08:27.708 --> 08:29.309
Admit you're powerless?

08:29.342 --> 08:31.244
Why do you have to admit
you're powerless?

08:31.278 --> 08:33.581
Because when it comes
to alcohol, we are powerless,

08:33.614 --> 08:35.282
and we need to remember that.

08:35.315 --> 08:37.651
It's just that I've known y'all
for a few days,

08:37.685 --> 08:39.252
and I don't see
any powerless women.

08:39.286 --> 08:40.788
That's 'cause we're not drunk.

08:40.821 --> 08:42.289
(laughs)

08:42.322 --> 08:44.224
Don't hide behind your humor.

08:44.257 --> 08:46.860
Then I got nothing.

08:46.894 --> 08:48.929
All due respect,

08:48.962 --> 08:51.832
I'm less interested in, um--
what do you call it?--

08:51.865 --> 08:53.266
your higher power,

08:53.300 --> 08:55.703
and more interested
in your inner power.

08:55.736 --> 08:57.337
That's the answer
to your problems.

08:57.370 --> 09:00.708
All due respect,
you're talking out your ass.

09:00.741 --> 09:03.744
See, now that's
powerful.

09:03.777 --> 09:06.847
Christy, what's stopping you
from reaching your goals

09:06.880 --> 09:09.082
is all that bad energy
in your life.

09:09.116 --> 09:11.184
I can help you get rid of it.

09:11.218 --> 09:14.287
If you're gonna
take out my mom, use poison.

09:14.321 --> 09:16.857
She'll see
any other weapons coming.

09:16.890 --> 09:18.626
All I'm saying is you
need to get rid of

09:18.659 --> 09:20.594
all that negativity
out of your system.

09:20.628 --> 09:24.231
If you want, I could
give you an energy cleanse.

09:24.264 --> 09:27.367
You'll have
a whole new you.

09:27.400 --> 09:29.369
No offense, but I
don't really think

09:29.402 --> 09:31.805
any of that stuff works.

09:31.839 --> 09:33.874
Bonnie, I said put
the coffee urn away!

09:33.907 --> 09:36.376
Okay, sorry.

09:36.409 --> 09:38.612
When do we start?

09:40.080 --> 09:42.249
I am so glad you see what
Miranda has to offer.

09:42.282 --> 09:44.151
You are gonna love this.

09:44.184 --> 09:47.921
I hope so. I've never had
my energy cleansed before.

09:47.955 --> 09:50.758
It's probably pretty crusty.

09:50.791 --> 09:52.626
(singsongy):
Hello!

09:54.094 --> 09:56.396
(singsongy):
Hello.

09:56.429 --> 09:58.298
Only she does that.

09:58.331 --> 10:00.801
Oh. Sorry.

10:00.834 --> 10:04.337
Are you ready to go
on a little journey to you?

10:04.371 --> 10:06.807
I guess.

10:06.840 --> 10:09.943
Okay, I'm gonna see you
on the other side.

10:09.977 --> 10:11.278
The other side?

10:11.311 --> 10:13.146
The kitchen.

10:13.180 --> 10:16.650
All right, sweetie,
I want you to lie down.

10:16.684 --> 10:19.252
Close your eyes.

10:19.286 --> 10:21.254
Free your mind.

10:21.288 --> 10:27.127
Imagine yourself floating
in a deep, warm river.

10:29.897 --> 10:31.098
(shouts)

10:31.131 --> 10:33.667
Oh!

10:33.701 --> 10:36.670
Sorry, I was
clearing my pathway.

10:36.704 --> 10:40.073
Okay, but you really should
warn a person.

10:42.409 --> 10:44.778
I'm going to go into
a little bit of a trance.

10:44.812 --> 10:46.680
(gentle music begins)

10:46.714 --> 10:49.116
I don't know
what's going to happen

10:49.149 --> 10:51.151
because every experience
is unique.

10:51.184 --> 10:53.153
I'll be processing your energy,

10:53.186 --> 10:55.789
and I may or may not
have visions along the way.

10:55.823 --> 10:57.691
We'll see.

10:57.725 --> 11:00.193
Permission to enter
your energy space?

11:02.062 --> 11:03.864
I'm gonna need a verbal "yes."

11:03.897 --> 11:06.800
Yes.

11:13.240 --> 11:15.408
(sings high-pitched note)

11:17.144 --> 11:19.747
(sings high-pitched note)

11:21.081 --> 11:22.850
(sings high-pitched note)

11:24.451 --> 11:26.486
(sings high-pitched note,
then low-pitched note)

11:26.519 --> 11:28.922
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Uh, what was that?

11:28.956 --> 11:31.358
Uh, that's a huge clump
of bad energy.

11:31.391 --> 11:33.293
I'm going to throw it away.

11:35.462 --> 11:36.864
(knuckles crack)

11:39.399 --> 11:41.134
(groaning)

11:41.168 --> 11:44.704
(guttural grunting)

11:51.444 --> 11:54.848
Let me guess,
that was my childhood.

12:01.521 --> 12:04.858
I'm serious. 24 hours later,
I still feel like I'm high.

12:04.892 --> 12:05.993
Clean energy is incredible.

12:06.026 --> 12:08.161
Settle down, Al Gore.

12:08.195 --> 12:12.332
That's so nice that you're
working with Miranda, too.

12:12.365 --> 12:14.401
After she got rid of
Christy's negative energy,

12:14.434 --> 12:17.037
my living room
smelled like sulfur.

12:17.070 --> 12:19.940
I don't know what she did,
but I am a different person now.

12:19.973 --> 12:22.242
A better person.
If only.

12:22.275 --> 12:25.178
I don't think Miranda
made you a better person.

12:25.212 --> 12:28.081
I'm guessing the program had
a lot more to do with it.

12:28.115 --> 12:30.217
Oh, sure, sure, sure.

12:30.250 --> 12:33.386
But I hit a wall, and Miranda's
helping me break through.

12:33.420 --> 12:36.957
Okay. Just one last
thing I'm gonna say.

12:36.990 --> 12:38.558
Again, if only.

12:38.591 --> 12:42.429
Just want to remind you
there are no quick fixes.

12:42.462 --> 12:45.999
I don't know. This was pretty
quick and I feel pretty fixed.

12:47.334 --> 12:49.937
Miranda told me
I have limitless power.

12:49.970 --> 12:52.973
And so now I am recommitting to
my dream of going to law school.

12:53.006 --> 12:55.008
(loudly):
How?

12:57.344 --> 13:00.213
Sorry.

13:00.247 --> 13:02.082
I'm gonna go see
the admissions people,

13:02.115 --> 13:03.984
and I'm gonna
change their minds.

13:04.017 --> 13:08.155
Oh. I believe I also suggested
you do some follow-up,

13:08.188 --> 13:12.059
but maybe you needed to
hear it in a squeaky voice.

13:12.092 --> 13:14.161
All I can say is

13:14.194 --> 13:16.329
that cleanse was the best
500 bucks I've ever spent.

13:16.363 --> 13:19.366
(stutters) What?

13:19.399 --> 13:21.468
You don't have that kind
of money to throw around.

13:21.501 --> 13:23.536
And if you do,
where have you been hiding it?

13:23.570 --> 13:25.205
I put it on my credit card.

13:25.238 --> 13:26.506
You don't have a credit card.

13:26.539 --> 13:28.909
And if you do,
where have you been hiding it?

13:28.942 --> 13:32.012
Miranda said she'd love
to do it for free,

13:32.045 --> 13:34.414
but the universe needs to know
a sacrifice has been made.

13:34.447 --> 13:36.984
And you bought that?
When did you become a boob?

13:38.218 --> 13:39.920
Hey, what's that say
about me?

13:39.953 --> 13:41.221
Well, you can afford
to be a boob.

13:41.254 --> 13:43.490
Back me up here,
loudmouth.

13:43.523 --> 13:45.525
(loudly):
Bonnie's right.

13:48.461 --> 13:52.966
(chanting): Namo amitabha,
namo amitabha, namo amitabha.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.401
Hello, Bonnie.

13:54.434 --> 13:57.037
How did you know it was me?

13:57.070 --> 13:59.940
The temperature changed,
the energy shifted,

13:59.973 --> 14:03.143
and your car backfired
in the driveway.

14:03.176 --> 14:05.512
Were you looking for Jill?
Looking for you.

14:05.545 --> 14:08.515
Look, I don't care if you're
dipping into Jill's Botox fund,

14:08.548 --> 14:10.583
but when you start taking
money from my daughter,

14:10.617 --> 14:13.286
who's barely scraping by,
that's when you hear from me.

14:13.320 --> 14:15.889
Oh, Bonnie, who hurt you?

14:15.923 --> 14:17.290
Don't even try.

14:17.324 --> 14:19.159
No, seriously, I want to know.

14:19.192 --> 14:21.128
And I got to tell you,
I respect the fact

14:21.161 --> 14:22.529
that you're protecting
your daughter,

14:22.562 --> 14:25.432
because I sense you were not
protected by your mother.

14:25.465 --> 14:27.901
Well, who told
you that? Jill?

14:27.935 --> 14:30.170
You did, just now,
with your eyes.

14:30.203 --> 14:32.105
What kind of carny
hustle is this?

14:32.139 --> 14:34.141
What, are you gonna guess
my cholesterol next?

14:34.174 --> 14:36.176
It's too high to joke about.

14:36.209 --> 14:38.445
Look, you may not
believe in what I do,

14:38.478 --> 14:41.381
but that doesn't change the fact
that I care about you.

14:41.414 --> 14:44.517
You don't even know me.
Why would you care about me?

14:44.551 --> 14:47.254
Exactly. You have
a hard time believing

14:47.287 --> 14:51.258
someone can care about you
because you were abandoned.

14:51.291 --> 14:54.227
Uh, I'm here to talk
about Christy.

14:54.261 --> 14:56.096
And it's not your fault
your mother left you.

14:56.129 --> 14:57.297
You were just a baby.

14:57.330 --> 14:58.565
Babies are pure,
they're perfect.

14:58.598 --> 15:00.934
You... sh-shut up!

15:00.968 --> 15:04.404
Oh. There is a perfect baby
inside of you.

15:04.437 --> 15:05.572
I am not falling
for this.

15:05.605 --> 15:08.141
Baby Bonnie!

15:08.175 --> 15:11.611
Oh, God, you-you
smell like cookies.

15:14.614 --> 15:18.151
Come, lie down.
Let me take away your pain.

15:18.185 --> 15:19.619
I'm not sure I...
On the house.

15:19.652 --> 15:21.654
Face up or face down?

15:30.630 --> 15:33.566
Just checking in.
It's been a couple hours.

15:33.600 --> 15:36.503
Any chance the admissions
director is gonna see me?

15:36.536 --> 15:39.139
I told you before, you
should've made an appointment.

15:39.172 --> 15:43.276
Normally I would've, but it was
recently brought to my attention

15:43.310 --> 15:45.412
that I have limitless power.

15:45.445 --> 15:48.248
You don't.

15:53.286 --> 15:55.255
(intercom beeps)

15:55.288 --> 15:57.424
HARRINGTON: Alice,
I blanked on Frank's birthday.

15:57.457 --> 16:00.527
Get me a reservation
somewhere fantastic tonight.

16:00.560 --> 16:02.595
ALICE: Of course,
no problem.

16:02.629 --> 16:04.731
I'm screwed.

16:04.764 --> 16:08.168
Wow, 5:00.

16:08.201 --> 16:10.337
Every restaurant in town's
gonna be full.

16:10.370 --> 16:12.305
Thanks.

16:12.339 --> 16:14.207
Are you familiar with
the Rustic Fig?

16:14.241 --> 16:16.209
Yeah, but they're booked
a month in advance.

16:16.243 --> 16:19.279
Unless you know someone
who has the limitless power

16:19.312 --> 16:21.314
of a waitress.

16:26.819 --> 16:31.324
(crying):
What is happening to me?!

16:31.358 --> 16:33.226
I opened you up.

16:33.260 --> 16:36.463
Well, snap me shut!

16:36.496 --> 16:38.198
You'll be okay.

16:38.231 --> 16:40.267
I just wouldn't make any
important life decisions

16:40.300 --> 16:42.269
for, say, 36 hours,

16:42.302 --> 16:45.305
and I would avoid operating
any heavy equipment.

16:45.338 --> 16:49.142
But what if I have
to drive a backhoe?

16:49.176 --> 16:51.578
Good, you're already
thinking big.

16:51.611 --> 16:54.114
(crying)
Miranda, I did it!

16:54.147 --> 16:56.783
I baked a batch of cookies
and only ate half of one!

16:56.816 --> 16:57.817
Breakthrough!

16:57.850 --> 16:59.686
(both laugh, hum)

16:59.719 --> 17:02.389
Wait for me!

17:02.422 --> 17:04.424
(all humming)

17:05.592 --> 17:07.194
I have amazing news.

17:07.227 --> 17:08.628
(crying):
Me, too.

17:08.661 --> 17:10.663
What happened?

17:10.697 --> 17:14.334
Miranda fracked me pretty good.

17:14.367 --> 17:15.702
Isn't she incredible?

17:15.735 --> 17:18.671
She is.
What's your news?

17:18.705 --> 17:21.341
I went to see the head of
admissions, stated my case,

17:21.374 --> 17:23.210
and she told me I
was on the bubble.

17:23.243 --> 17:24.411
They almost accepted me.

17:24.444 --> 17:25.845
If I bump my LSAT
scores up a notch,

17:25.878 --> 17:27.414
she'll find a place
for me next year.

17:27.447 --> 17:30.350
Oh, baby! (laughs)

17:30.383 --> 17:32.252
Tell me again what the LSAT is.

17:32.285 --> 17:33.586
The big lawyer test, Mom.

17:33.620 --> 17:36.556
I thought that was the bar exam!
(crying)

17:36.589 --> 17:38.558
That's the other
big lawyer test.

17:38.591 --> 17:40.527
Can I please
finish my story?

17:40.560 --> 17:43.196
I'm sorry.
I've always interrupted you.

17:43.230 --> 17:44.764
It's okay, Mom.
Sometimes you just...

17:44.797 --> 17:47.500
It's not o...
When will I stop?!

17:47.534 --> 17:50.203
(crying)

17:50.237 --> 17:52.405
(ringtone playing)

17:52.439 --> 17:54.407
Hello?

17:54.441 --> 17:55.542
Christy, it's Miranda.

17:55.575 --> 17:57.377
Hey, you are not gonna believe

17:57.410 --> 17:59.412
what happened to me,
and it's all thanks to you.

17:59.446 --> 18:01.748
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you had the
power within you the whole time.

18:01.781 --> 18:04.284
Listen, we got a bit
of a situation over here.

18:04.317 --> 18:08.288
I went out for a hike, I came
back, and I found her like this.

18:08.321 --> 18:10.323
Oh, my God.
What happened?

18:10.357 --> 18:12.459
I was working with her
on moderation.

18:12.492 --> 18:15.228
I convinced her she could eat
half a cookie, then stop.

18:15.262 --> 18:16.596
So she tried it with booze.
Yeah.

18:16.629 --> 18:18.465
(slurring):
I messed up.

18:18.498 --> 18:20.533
Don't worry, honey, we're here.

18:30.910 --> 18:33.446
I can't believe
I threw away all that time.

18:33.480 --> 18:35.582
I'm so stupid.

18:35.615 --> 18:38.185
You're not stupid;
you're an alcoholic.

18:38.218 --> 18:39.586
I'm really sorry, Jill.

18:39.619 --> 18:41.654
Not your fault, Miranda.

18:41.688 --> 18:44.657
You can't make someone get sober
and you can't make them drink.

18:44.691 --> 18:47.394
Marjorie?

18:47.427 --> 18:48.495
Yes, honey?

18:48.528 --> 18:50.363
Half a cookie
doesn't work.

18:50.397 --> 18:51.531
Not for you, sweetie.

18:51.564 --> 18:55.535
None of us are
half a cookie people.

18:55.568 --> 18:57.604
(crying): Even though
I really want to be.

18:57.637 --> 19:00.540
(loudly): Oh, pipe down.
It's not about you!

19:00.573 --> 19:02.842
Marjorie,
Wendy's being mean to me.

19:04.444 --> 19:07.480
Okay, this may
be your fault.
