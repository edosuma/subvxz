00:00.676 --> 00:03.246
In New York City's war on crime,

00:03.246 --> 00:06.547
the worst criminal offenders
are pursued by the detectives

00:06.547 --> 00:08.208
of the Major Case Squad.

00:08.208 --> 00:10.217
These are their stories.

00:12.376 --> 00:15.160
Who the hell does he think he is, god?

00:15.160 --> 00:18.001
Look, I know how you feel,
but you need to calm down.

00:18.001 --> 00:20.228
Calm down? This is my son.

00:20.228 --> 00:21.415
Is everything all right...

00:21.415 --> 00:23.678
You're the guy I want to talk to.

00:28.468 --> 00:31.902
No, I'm not talking about it.
It's done.

00:31.902 --> 00:33.208
And it doesn't matter what I think?

00:33.208 --> 00:35.411
No. I run the business.

00:35.411 --> 00:36.757
You're my little brother, and I love you,

00:36.757 --> 00:40.476
but stick to what you do best...
delivering babies.

00:42.933 --> 00:45.387
It's happening. Call Dr. Rush.

00:45.387 --> 00:46.577
Is this your first?

00:46.577 --> 00:48.415
Un-huh. She's having contractions.

00:48.415 --> 00:50.303
Have a seat.
I need you to fill these out.

00:50.303 --> 00:52.994
And I need your insurance card.

00:57.511 --> 00:59.135
Jason, where the hell have you been?

00:59.135 --> 01:01.057
I called, mom.

01:02.694 --> 01:05.066
Where the hell have you been?

01:08.298 --> 01:11.506
- I'm sure he's on his way.
- And when he arrives,

01:11.506 --> 01:13.350
I have a very nice table
waiting for the two of you.

01:13.350 --> 01:14.879
Hi. / Eli.

01:14.879 --> 01:15.993
Sorry I'm so late.

01:15.993 --> 01:19.196
I got called in to the hospital,
Emergency c-section, triplets.

01:19.196 --> 01:20.647
Triplets?

01:20.647 --> 01:22.489
Thank god they all made it.

01:22.489 --> 01:23.941
You look fantastic.

01:23.941 --> 01:26.232
I'll show you to your table, Dr. Rush.

01:28.918 --> 01:30.452
All right already. I'm here.

01:30.452 --> 01:33.056
Where's Dr. Rush?
I think it's time.

01:33.945 --> 01:35.217
This baby is coming.

01:35.217 --> 01:37.854
Get that son of a bitch here now!

- No.

01:52.016 --> 01:53.843
My brother's on call.

01:54.403 --> 01:56.133

The wig's in the closet,
put my lipstick on and you're good.

03:01.229 --> 03:02.442
Gotta go.

03:02.814 --> 03:05.200
Hey, sorry I'm late.
What do we got?

03:05.200 --> 03:07.966
Relax, Falacci. I just got here myself.

03:07.966 --> 03:11.398
I know it's your day off,
but it is what it is.

03:11.398 --> 03:14.224
Trust me, I'll take a crime scene
over playing a clown

03:14.224 --> 03:17.604
at the neighbor's kid's birthday
party any day. / Yeah.

03:18.187 --> 03:20.981
Dr. Zach Rush, 42. OB-GYN.

03:20.981 --> 03:23.121
That blood trail leads
right into the exam room

03:23.121 --> 03:24.951
where he's trussed up on the table.

03:24.951 --> 03:27.162
That's the primary crime scene.

03:28.660 --> 03:29.808
Who found him?

03:29.808 --> 03:31.170
His brother Eli.

03:31.170 --> 03:34.437
They share the practice.
He called 911 around 3:00 A.M.

03:34.437 --> 03:37.057
He's around the corner at Zach's
apartment comforting the wife.

03:37.057 --> 03:38.825
Get him back here.

03:43.127 --> 03:44.630
It's bleach.

03:44.630 --> 03:46.977
Just on these blood droplets.

03:46.977 --> 03:49.348
Killer's trying to cover his own DNA.

03:49.348 --> 03:52.071
Might have cut himself on this.

03:52.607 --> 03:56.922
Photo cube.
Turned into a murder weapon.

04:01.811 --> 04:03.315
Blunt trauma.

04:03.315 --> 04:07.253
Bits of glass in the face and scalp.

04:07.253 --> 04:09.751
Lacerations around the mouth.

04:09.751 --> 04:13.172
What's that doing on the floor?
Let's bag this.

04:16.728 --> 04:19.838
Pretty advanced rigor.
Stiff but not rigid.

04:19.838 --> 04:25.320
Puts the time of death at somewhere
between 8:00 and 10:00 P.M.

04:26.094 --> 04:29.146
Homicide investigator's masters class.

04:29.146 --> 04:31.789
I'll have to check that out some day.

04:32.223 --> 04:36.124
Hey, there's something off here.
Look at his belt.

04:36.124 --> 04:38.117
It's out of half the loops.

04:38.117 --> 04:40.137
Victim's brother's here.

04:46.616 --> 04:50.342
I saw Zach around 7:00 last night
before I went on a date.

04:50.342 --> 04:51.359
He was on call.

04:51.359 --> 04:53.623
So what were you doing
back here at 3:00 A.M.?

04:53.623 --> 04:55.460
Zach wasn't answering his cell.

04:55.460 --> 04:58.004
The hospital called me for a delivery.

04:58.004 --> 05:00.058
After I finished,
I still couldn't get through to Zach.

05:00.058 --> 05:02.109
So I came to the office.

05:02.109 --> 05:04.498
And you found Zach on the exam table?

05:04.498 --> 05:07.202
It was horrible finding him like that.

05:07.202 --> 05:10.114
Is that why you pulled his pants up?

05:11.354 --> 05:14.079
I'm a medical professional.
I should have known better.

05:14.079 --> 05:17.739
But he was my brother,
and I panicked.

05:17.739 --> 05:19.248
I understand.

05:19.510 --> 05:20.845
What else did you do?

05:20.845 --> 05:25.070
There was an instrument lodged
in his mouth when I found him.

05:25.070 --> 05:26.065
The speculum.

05:26.065 --> 05:29.421
I took it out, and tried to
give him mouth to mouth.

05:29.421 --> 05:33.084
There must have been glass on his face.
I cut myself.

05:33.084 --> 05:35.245
Well, we're gonna need
a sample of your blood.

05:35.245 --> 05:38.227
- So we can see which DNA is which.
- Of course.

05:38.227 --> 05:41.775
Uh, doc, one more thing.
Does your office perform abortions?

05:41.775 --> 05:43.218
What?

05:43.903 --> 05:45.916
From the body's staging,

05:45.916 --> 05:49.900
looks like someone might have
been trying to send a message.

05:51.110 --> 05:53.490
My brother did terminations.
Not me.

05:53.490 --> 05:55.297
Well, we're gonna have
to look at that angle.

05:55.297 --> 05:57.244
Who handles your appointment records?

05:57.244 --> 06:00.067
Helen Combs, our office manager.

06:00.612 --> 06:02.254
Are you sure it wasn't a robbery?

06:02.254 --> 06:04.100
Miss Combs, the drug
cabinets were locked,

06:04.100 --> 06:05.755
and his script pads were still in his desk.

06:05.755 --> 06:07.041
It makes no sense.

06:07.041 --> 06:08.182
Who would do this to him?

06:08.182 --> 06:10.608
We understand that
he performed abortions.

06:10.608 --> 06:14.003
Just for his regular patients.
We were under the radar of fanatics.

06:14.003 --> 06:15.484
Still a very sensitive issue.

06:15.484 --> 06:17.999
Do you recall any boyfriends, husbands,
who were particularly upset?

06:17.999 --> 06:19.519
No.

06:19.519 --> 06:21.820
These beautiful babies.

06:21.820 --> 06:23.717
His patients loved Dr. Zach.

06:23.717 --> 06:25.811
Well, what about employees?

06:25.811 --> 06:29.181
I mean, sometimes
when you do your job right,

06:29.181 --> 06:30.797
people still don't like you.

06:30.797 --> 06:35.169
Well, there's me, the girls, and Tom.

06:35.169 --> 06:38.878
Oh, both the brothers were
upset with him.

06:38.878 --> 06:41.129
- Tom who?
- Tom Pittino, our genetics counselor.

06:41.129 --> 06:42.557
Comes in once a week.

06:42.557 --> 06:45.883
Something was going on with
one of his clients yesterday.

06:46.209 --> 06:49.458
I council patients about their options.
These are tough decisions.

06:49.458 --> 06:52.060
"their options"?
You mean "abortion," don't you?

06:52.060 --> 06:55.780
Sometimes there are no easy answers.
People get emotional.

06:55.780 --> 06:59.687
Do they get emotional?
Or do they get angry?

07:00.833 --> 07:03.024
And we heard you had a problem
with Dr. Rush's yesterday.

07:03.024 --> 07:04.908
You wanna tell us what that was about?

07:04.908 --> 07:07.288
Not me.
A client was upset with Zach.

07:07.288 --> 07:09.566
Keep going. Who was the patient?

07:09.566 --> 07:10.837
You know I can't tell you that.

07:10.837 --> 07:13.618
Fine. We'll get a court order.

07:18.434 --> 07:20.645
Jason, is that vodka?

07:20.645 --> 07:22.569
You would know.

07:24.927 --> 07:26.245
- Mrs. Rush.
- Hmm?

07:26.245 --> 07:29.489
- You might not remember me.
- Of course, um...

07:29.489 --> 07:32.732
Tom, you're the new counselor.

07:32.732 --> 07:35.563
Your husband was a good man.

07:35.784 --> 07:37.005
Thank you.

07:37.005 --> 07:39.562
Paula, your mother's leaving.

07:39.789 --> 07:41.604
Excuse me.

07:43.287 --> 07:46.135
He's a strange guy.
How are you holding up?

07:46.135 --> 07:47.586
Get me another.

07:47.586 --> 07:50.889
And keep an eye on Jason.
And stay out of my way.

08:05.620 --> 08:09.166
Could you get your dog to heel?
He's making my partner nervous.

08:09.166 --> 08:13.668
Flynn, heel. Shh. Heel.
Good girl.

08:13.668 --> 08:15.481
I'm the patient with a record.

08:15.481 --> 08:18.240
So I lose my right to confidentiality.

08:18.240 --> 08:21.999
Well, you, uh...
You did sic your dogs on a teenager.

08:21.999 --> 08:23.557
He was 19.

08:23.557 --> 08:27.322
He was making it with my 14-year-old.
What would you do?

08:29.395 --> 08:32.005
Your fight with Dr. Rush,
you wanna tell us about that?

08:32.005 --> 08:34.316
The man talked my wife
into having an abortion.

08:34.316 --> 08:35.812
And you think abortion is murder?

08:35.812 --> 08:37.681
No, that's not it.

08:38.594 --> 08:41.326
My wife was carrying a boy
with spina bifida.

08:41.326 --> 08:43.767
Severe.
But I wanted the baby anyway.

08:43.767 --> 08:45.040
They didn't consult you?

08:45.040 --> 08:47.762
No, the bastard just killed my boy.

08:48.045 --> 08:49.881
I've got three daughters.

08:49.881 --> 08:52.294
He was gonna be my son.

08:52.294 --> 08:53.834
Where were you Monday night?

08:53.834 --> 08:55.982
In the park training my dogs.

08:55.982 --> 08:57.286
Anybody see you?

08:57.286 --> 08:59.884
They're not always the most
social animals in the world.

08:59.884 --> 09:01.424
So that would be a "no"?

09:01.424 --> 09:02.426
We're not talking,

09:02.426 --> 09:04.137
but my wife,
she saw me leave the house.

09:04.137 --> 09:05.681
She saw me go home.

09:05.681 --> 09:09.838
- Okay. That's a beautiful dog.
- Yes, she is.

09:12.077 --> 09:14.697
I agonized over the decision.

09:14.697 --> 09:19.474
George wanted a son, but he had no idea
what it would do to our family.

09:19.474 --> 09:21.669
How did George take it?

09:21.890 --> 09:23.209
Emma?

09:23.760 --> 09:26.265
Uh, he...

09:26.265 --> 09:28.708
He's still furious.

09:28.708 --> 09:31.918
Every night, I come home.
George goes out.

09:31.918 --> 09:34.401
Just paces with the dogs.

09:34.401 --> 09:37.864
- Was he pacing Monday night?
- Till 1:00.

09:37.864 --> 09:42.443
I watched by the kitchen window,
hoping that...

09:43.647 --> 09:45.389
You don't think George...

09:45.389 --> 09:48.534
We know he had a problem with Rush.

09:48.534 --> 09:52.762
George yelled a lot,
but I'm who he was mad at.

09:52.762 --> 09:57.613
I called Dr. Rush to apologize.
He's very understanding.

09:57.613 --> 09:59.938
Said he's been through a lot.

09:59.938 --> 10:02.622
Especially with his son.

10:03.019 --> 10:04.814
What about his son?

10:04.814 --> 10:08.231
Kids. It's just not easy.

10:08.231 --> 10:12.027
Excuse me. Emma. Emma.

10:13.381 --> 10:16.096
I've called three times
for the DNA results.

10:16.096 --> 10:18.766
I mean, I thought Major Case had pull.

10:18.766 --> 10:21.675
Rogers tells me it was five calls,
not three.

10:21.675 --> 10:23.611
And she explained the lab needed time

10:23.611 --> 10:26.051
because the crime scene was
contaminated by a blood relative.

10:26.051 --> 10:29.598
So you always make excuses
for the people you work with?

10:29.598 --> 10:32.957
Detective, it's okay to have the thought.
You don't always have to say it.

10:32.957 --> 10:34.363
Moving on...

10:34.363 --> 10:37.551
about Rush's son Jason.

10:37.551 --> 10:39.460
Impulse control issues.

10:39.460 --> 10:44.819
He was expelled once for cheating,
once for bullying. / Appreciate that.

10:44.819 --> 10:47.795
That was an old drinking buddy of mine
down at the two-one.

10:47.795 --> 10:50.330
Says they got called
to the Rushes' apartment

10:50.330 --> 10:53.294
about six months ago
on a domestic dispute.

10:53.294 --> 10:57.447
Apparently, the father and son
were going at it during a passover seder.

10:57.447 --> 11:00.335
Guess we know
who didn't find the afikomen.

11:02.879 --> 11:05.890
It's like an easter egg hunt with a matzo.

11:05.890 --> 11:07.194
Anyway, pay a call.

11:07.194 --> 11:10.390
See if the boy and his father
ever buried the hatchet.

11:10.667 --> 11:13.591
Logan, you got a sec?

11:18.948 --> 11:21.668
How are things working out
with you two?

11:21.949 --> 11:23.721
Working.

11:24.163 --> 11:29.121
Falacci's not really a people person.

11:29.121 --> 11:30.701
Yeah.

11:30.701 --> 11:32.705
But she's a closer.

11:32.705 --> 11:37.504
Besides, I wanna take a shot
at being the diplomat for once.

11:39.431 --> 11:41.837
What was that all about?

11:42.120 --> 11:43.594
You.

11:43.594 --> 11:47.397
Did he say I'm not a people person?

11:47.911 --> 11:49.784
I'd let it go.

11:54.708 --> 11:57.606
Jason revered his father.
He's straightening up.

11:57.606 --> 12:00.751
In fact, he's going to Appleton this fall.

12:00.751 --> 12:04.116
Hate to tell you, but we just locked up
one of their finest for murder last year.

12:04.116 --> 12:06.154
Hear that, mom?

12:06.154 --> 12:09.567
That's where you're sending me
to straighten up.

12:10.254 --> 12:13.592
Jason. That's funny. Your mom said
you weren't home.

12:13.592 --> 12:17.920
So, um, where were you
the night your father was murdered?

12:17.920 --> 12:19.783
Chillin' with friends by the bandshell.

12:19.783 --> 12:21.294
Well, we're gonna want to talk to them.

12:21.294 --> 12:25.048
Good luck, they were getting tweaked
on Vicodin and coke.

12:25.048 --> 12:26.688
And what were you, a chaperone?

12:26.688 --> 12:28.993
I was wasted.

12:28.993 --> 12:31.999
At least I'm being honest about it.

12:31.999 --> 12:34.693
Hey, I'm all about peace.

12:34.693 --> 12:36.574
Well, if you're so peaceful,

12:36.574 --> 12:40.520
why did you threaten
your father on passover?

12:45.007 --> 12:46.558
Stand up.

12:46.880 --> 12:48.581
Stand up.

12:48.885 --> 12:51.110
Let me see your hands.

12:53.229 --> 12:55.057
Where'd you get these nicks?

12:55.057 --> 12:57.227
Cutting coke.

12:58.865 --> 13:01.592
Anything else you wanna see, fire crotch?

13:01.592 --> 13:03.069
That's it, I'm taking this little prick in.

13:03.069 --> 13:05.415
No need, Logan.
We got his DNA right here.

13:05.415 --> 13:06.319
You can't take that.

13:06.319 --> 13:10.981
Well, it's either him or the shirt.
Your choice.

13:20.385 --> 13:23.553
If the lab ever gets back to us,
we might have a match.

13:23.553 --> 13:26.505
I mean, this kid's three stages
from sociopath.

13:26.505 --> 13:28.095
If you say so.

13:28.095 --> 13:31.580
For now, he admits to being in the park
with his friends doing drugs.

13:31.580 --> 13:33.753
What, you think that's an alibi?

13:33.753 --> 13:35.813
How 'bout a habit?

13:35.813 --> 13:38.327
Right. So if he was in his dad's office,

13:38.327 --> 13:41.482
why leave the drugs
and prescription pads?

13:42.314 --> 13:47.288
I was more interested when he said,
"at least I was being honest."

13:47.288 --> 13:50.714
He was looking at his mother
right in the eye when he said that.

13:50.714 --> 13:53.749
So he could just be
acting like a teenager.

13:53.749 --> 13:56.506
Or she could be hiding something.

13:57.508 --> 14:01.532
Falacci, does that mean
that you just agreed with me?

14:01.532 --> 14:03.513
- Keys.
- It's my turn to drive.

14:03.513 --> 14:06.229
Oh, come on, Logan.
I wanna get there.

14:08.540 --> 14:10.185
Nice catch.

14:13.496 --> 14:15.348
Well, Jason was right about one thing.

14:15.348 --> 14:17.125
He was being more honest
than his mother.

14:17.125 --> 14:18.561
What have you got?

14:18.561 --> 14:22.905
Paula Rush signed up for a family plan
with one cell phone carrier last year.

14:22.905 --> 14:26.926
But then she set up an individual plan
just for herself with a different carrier.

14:26.926 --> 14:28.831
She only calls one number on that line.

14:28.831 --> 14:30.174
A no-name cell.

14:30.174 --> 14:32.453
One other possible tell
she's up to something.

14:32.453 --> 14:34.243
Here's her credit card statement.

14:34.243 --> 14:36.407
She joined a new gym last year.

14:36.407 --> 14:39.879
Two sessions a week
with a personal trainer.

14:40.630 --> 14:45.322
I already told you, my son had nothing
to do with Zach's murder.

14:45.322 --> 14:48.031
His friends confirmed
he was partying in the park.

14:48.031 --> 14:50.412
So what time did he get home?

14:50.412 --> 14:51.718
Early. 8:30.

14:51.718 --> 14:54.015
You seem very sure about that.

14:54.015 --> 14:56.363
We came home within minutes
of each other.

14:56.363 --> 14:59.887
I had just come back from the gym.
I was with my trainer, Ted.

14:59.887 --> 15:03.201
Oh, we can call the gym,
find out if you were there.

15:03.201 --> 15:05.527
What are you people saying?

15:05.833 --> 15:08.957
I was devoted to my husband.

15:09.169 --> 15:14.518
Well, uh, if you were so devoted,

15:14.518 --> 15:17.602
why do you have a private cell phone?

15:18.262 --> 15:19.855
Excuse me?

15:19.855 --> 15:23.203
So you just have the one number?

15:24.120 --> 15:27.149
The one I just dialed you on.

15:31.692 --> 15:36.165
- That's right.
- We must have made a mistake.

15:43.097 --> 15:45.496
Do you want to answer that?

15:50.587 --> 15:55.467
So Paula, you wanna
save your son, right?

15:55.789 --> 15:57.888
Well, you can start
by being honest with us.

15:57.888 --> 16:00.592
Who were you having the affair with?

16:05.065 --> 16:09.300
I was having a close
relationship with someone.

16:09.300 --> 16:12.627
But I don't think...
I'm sure he has nothing to do with this.

16:12.627 --> 16:15.993
We don't care what you think.

16:15.993 --> 16:18.347
Who is he?

16:18.347 --> 16:21.301
My brother-in-law, Eli.

16:22.197 --> 16:25.847
And your husband knew
about this affair?

16:25.847 --> 16:27.551
No.

16:27.551 --> 16:29.347
In fact, it was over.

16:29.347 --> 16:31.359
Over when?

16:31.359 --> 16:32.986
Monday night.

16:32.986 --> 16:36.180
I met Eli for drinks,
and I broke it off.

16:36.180 --> 16:40.112
For my son's sake.
He suspected something,

16:40.112 --> 16:42.766
and he was starting to act out.

16:53.852 --> 16:55.491
Looking for me?

16:55.859 --> 16:57.672
You okay?
They called. I thought...

16:57.672 --> 17:01.377
I'm fine.
Just needed an oil change.

17:10.193 --> 17:12.021
Yes, I was sleeping with Paula.

17:12.021 --> 17:14.757
And if I heard that about anyone else,
I'd be appalled.

17:14.757 --> 17:17.266
But like the man said,
the heart wants what it wants.

17:17.266 --> 17:20.636
You can just have the thought, doctor.

17:20.636 --> 17:22.298
Did your brother know about the affair?

17:22.298 --> 17:24.809
No, I'd never hurt him like that.

17:24.809 --> 17:26.395
Neither of us wanted this to happen.

17:26.395 --> 17:28.664
We drew close because Paula
was having a problem with Jason.

17:28.664 --> 17:30.425
- Zach couldn't handle him.
- And you could?

17:30.425 --> 17:31.736
Do you have children?

17:31.736 --> 17:34.789
No, I can't actually.
It's the sadness of my life.

17:34.789 --> 17:38.351
But at least I'm able
to bring that joy to other people.

17:38.351 --> 17:40.657
Let's get back to your time line.

17:40.657 --> 17:41.517
Time line?

17:41.517 --> 17:44.789
Yeah, the night your brother was getting
his head bashed in.

17:44.789 --> 17:48.157
You went for that drink with his wife
at 7:30 until...

17:48.157 --> 17:52.212
8:15. And no, I didn't go back
to the office until 3:00 A.M.

17:52.212 --> 17:55.178
So it's just a coincidence
that an hour after his wife dumps you,

17:55.178 --> 17:58.256
- your brother ends up dead?
- Dumped me?

17:58.256 --> 18:00.004
I broke it off with Paula.

18:00.004 --> 18:02.011
Really? Any reason?

18:02.011 --> 18:04.957
Yeah, Kiki. That's who I spent
the rest of the evening with.

18:04.957 --> 18:07.088
And the restaurant can confirm that.

18:07.088 --> 18:09.985
Kiki doesn't need to know about Paula.

18:13.289 --> 18:16.942
I thought he was standing me up.
He was so late.

18:16.942 --> 18:18.717
What time did he finally get there, Kiki?

18:18.717 --> 18:21.617
Close to 9:30.
I was like, phh.

18:21.617 --> 18:24.225
They almost gave our table away.

18:24.225 --> 18:25.950
Did he say where he had been?

18:25.950 --> 18:29.520
Yeah, at the hospital, delivering triplets.

18:29.520 --> 18:33.551
So did he seem a little...
upset or tense to you?

18:33.551 --> 18:36.029
No. We talked about work.

18:36.029 --> 18:38.330
You mean he talked about his work.

18:38.330 --> 18:43.076
Yes, he loves it.
The joy that he brings to families.

18:43.076 --> 18:49.017
Did he say anything to you about
the sadness of his life?

18:49.774 --> 18:53.101
How he can't have children?

18:53.101 --> 18:55.569
How did you know that?

18:56.004 --> 18:58.407
He's a dog.
It doesn't mean he's a killer.

18:58.407 --> 19:02.837
Eli left Paula at 8:15.
He kept Kiki waiting until 9:30.

19:02.837 --> 19:05.732
That hour would be
when he was delivering the triplets.

19:05.732 --> 19:06.983
Not according to the hospital.

19:06.983 --> 19:08.726
No triplets delivered the whole week.

19:08.726 --> 19:12.162
Well, maybe it was simple
as him trying to impress his date.

19:12.162 --> 19:14.912
The bar where he met Paula
was right by his office.

19:14.912 --> 19:18.170
So an hour to kill his brother,
truss him up,

19:18.170 --> 19:19.407
and then to get through his dinner.

19:19.407 --> 19:20.721
If he's moving fast, sure.

19:20.721 --> 19:23.341
What's your theory?
His brother confronted him about the affair,

19:23.341 --> 19:25.682
they argued, Eli killed him?

19:25.682 --> 19:29.028
Well, Zach Rush was killed
using a cube full of family photos.

19:29.028 --> 19:30.683
Interesting metaphor.

19:30.683 --> 19:34.421
Was it a metaphor
or a symbol, Falacci?

19:34.421 --> 19:38.852
Guess I'd have to take your homicide
investigation course to find out.

19:40.605 --> 19:42.587
The lab sorted it out.

19:42.587 --> 19:46.400
There was blood from three separate
individuals at the Rush crime scene.

19:46.400 --> 19:48.777
So what was the holdup?

19:49.023 --> 19:51.420
The holdup, Falacci,

19:51.420 --> 19:55.977
is that it's a complicated case,
and the lab wanted to get it right.

19:56.163 --> 20:00.739
All right, the first sample
is from your victim, Zach Rush.

20:00.739 --> 20:02.852
The second sample
from the exam room.

20:02.852 --> 20:06.157
It matches the DNA you were given
by the victim's brother, Eli Rush.

20:06.157 --> 20:08.951
Yeah, well, there's
no surprise there either.

20:08.951 --> 20:11.502
He made a point of telling us
that he contaminated the crime scene.

20:11.502 --> 20:13.861
So this is complicated because?

20:13.861 --> 20:15.544
Falacci.

20:15.544 --> 20:17.623
The third sample,

20:17.623 --> 20:21.779
which was taken from the underside
of the bleached carpet swatch,

20:21.779 --> 20:24.035
it's a third blood relative.

20:24.035 --> 20:25.938
Direct relative?

20:27.757 --> 20:29.170
Zach's son Jason.

20:29.170 --> 20:33.226
Our first guess, but we ruled him out
when we ran the DNA from his t-shirt.

20:33.226 --> 20:34.734
Did Zach Rush have another son?

20:34.734 --> 20:36.329
No, it's not Zach Rush's son.

20:36.329 --> 20:39.978
It's the son of this man,
the victim's brother.

20:39.978 --> 20:42.309
Eli Rush.

20:42.309 --> 20:45.317
Are you sure?
He told us he couldn't have children.

20:45.317 --> 20:46.894
Falacci, two things we know...

20:46.894 --> 20:50.556
DNA doesn't lie and Eli Rush does.

20:58.130 --> 21:00.761
You told us you were sterile, Dr. Rush.

21:00.761 --> 21:03.346
I am.
I have been my whole life.

21:04.259 --> 21:07.608
That's your son's DNA, doctor.

21:07.608 --> 21:09.532
You're looking right at it.

21:09.532 --> 21:12.871
Oh, I work with labs all the time.
They make mistakes.

21:12.871 --> 21:15.084
This is probably my nephew
Jason's DNA.

21:15.084 --> 21:17.766
Yeah, Jason gave me
a sample of his DNA.

21:17.766 --> 21:20.070
It doesn't match this.

21:20.269 --> 21:21.691
Doc.

21:22.421 --> 21:26.380
Does it mean anything to you
that your brother's dead?

21:26.722 --> 21:28.748
First you tell me I killed my brother.

21:28.748 --> 21:30.808
Now you're telling me I have a son.

21:30.808 --> 21:32.746
I don't know how you managed
to screw this up so badly,

21:32.746 --> 21:36.353
but from now on,
you can talk to my lawyer.

21:39.639 --> 21:42.355
Why would he tell us he's sterile?

21:42.355 --> 21:44.926
Hey, he's an OB-GYN.

21:44.926 --> 21:47.698
He's not mistaken. He's lying.

21:47.698 --> 21:50.480
To protect his son
because the kid's the murderer?

21:50.480 --> 21:52.815
Or to protect himself
because the kid's a witness?

21:52.815 --> 21:54.449
There's a third possibility.

21:54.449 --> 21:56.965
Maybe Eli doesn't know he has a son.

21:56.965 --> 21:58.404
You mean, like, a one night stand,

21:58.404 --> 22:00.641
or an ex who decided
to have the kid on her own?

22:00.641 --> 22:02.039
Those were my first guesses,

22:02.039 --> 22:04.127
but the doctor's never been
sued for child support.

22:04.127 --> 22:06.463
With a practice like his,
he'd be a prime target.

22:06.463 --> 22:07.893
Then it occurred to me,

22:07.893 --> 22:11.120
a lot of med students donate
to sperm banks.

22:11.120 --> 22:14.999
Right. Doctors and ivy leaguers,
they get paid a premium.

22:15.489 --> 22:18.571
Here's a guy who claims he's sterile.

22:18.571 --> 22:20.618
They got a premium for blanks?

22:20.618 --> 22:23.380
Doctor Rush has an inability
to tell the truth.

22:23.380 --> 22:26.258
You need to look up some of
his old med school buddies.

22:26.258 --> 22:28.760
See if he's always had that condition.

22:30.385 --> 22:32.417
We were roommates for two years.

22:32.417 --> 22:35.800
But, uh, Rush was
a little too alpha for me.

22:35.800 --> 22:37.183
Yeah, we get that.

22:37.183 --> 22:39.423
He made my wife uncomfortable too.

22:39.423 --> 22:41.649
Oh? See him around lately?

22:41.649 --> 22:43.046
Occasionally.

22:43.046 --> 22:45.200
The baby he delivered
becomes our patient.

22:45.200 --> 22:49.290
But, uh, Eli doesn't do
a lot of follow-through.

22:49.290 --> 22:51.398
You mentioned that he made
your wife uncomfortable.

22:51.398 --> 22:53.076
Does that mean he hit on her?

22:53.076 --> 22:55.136
He hit on all beautiful women.

22:55.136 --> 22:57.868
But once he got them,
he was on to the next.

22:57.868 --> 23:01.723
Or maybe they left him
once they found out he was sterile?

23:01.723 --> 23:05.250
Sterile?
Is he still using that line?

23:05.250 --> 23:06.632
Apparently.

23:06.632 --> 23:08.456
He came up with that in med school.

23:08.456 --> 23:12.088
When a girl got too serious,
he'd mention his condition,

23:12.088 --> 23:14.377
and they'd move on without a scene.

23:14.377 --> 23:15.892
Smart cookie.

23:15.892 --> 23:17.668
Did he ever get anyone pregnant?

23:17.668 --> 23:19.182
No, he wore protection.

23:19.182 --> 23:21.661
He was paranoid about STDs.

23:21.661 --> 23:25.092
I could go on all day about Eli.
But what's this about?

23:25.092 --> 23:27.512
We're looking for his biological son.

23:27.512 --> 23:28.948
Good luck.

23:28.948 --> 23:31.873
Eli hit the sperm bank twice
a week back then.

23:31.873 --> 23:34.116
He bragged about his popularity.

23:34.116 --> 23:37.882
How do you become popular
at a sperm bank? It's anonymous.

23:37.882 --> 23:40.205
He really thinks he's god's gift.

23:40.205 --> 23:42.196
And his profile made him sound like it.

23:42.196 --> 23:47.395
He claimed he was a green-eyed
tennis star with perfect pitch,

23:47.395 --> 23:51.024
who played the oboe and
spoke Russian and Greek.

23:51.024 --> 23:54.274
You closed your eyes.
You have eidetic memory?

23:54.274 --> 23:57.450
Yeah. Also he had me write it for him.

23:57.450 --> 24:01.524
Good, 'cause we're gonna need you
to remember where that sperm bank was.

24:03.661 --> 24:04.795
There he is.

24:04.795 --> 24:07.989
Right down to the oboe.
Donor 305.

24:07.989 --> 24:10.818
Gives the month and year he was born,
but not the day.

24:10.818 --> 24:12.943
Doesn't mention red hair either.

24:12.943 --> 24:15.800
Yeah, you'd think that
would be a selling point.

24:17.002 --> 24:19.388
Logan, where's your ring?

24:19.946 --> 24:22.059
Don't worry, my dear.

24:22.059 --> 24:26.637
Everything is going to be fine.

24:29.486 --> 24:31.418
- Hi.
- Hello.

24:31.418 --> 24:33.553
We're interested in this profile, please.

24:33.553 --> 24:36.131
Okay. Number 305.

24:36.893 --> 24:40.305
Oh, I'm so sorry.
This should have been deleted by now.

24:40.305 --> 24:43.665
Well, he's the one we want.
We're both musicians.

24:43.665 --> 24:45.805
Well, I had a nice trumpet player
come in today.

24:45.805 --> 24:48.476
No, I'm Russian, and he's Greek.

24:48.476 --> 24:49.934
So this one's perfect.

24:49.934 --> 24:52.976
A lot of couples thought so.
That's why he's sold out.

24:52.976 --> 24:55.990
We read that sometimes people
buy more than they need.

24:55.990 --> 24:58.503
Any chance you could put us in touch
with anyone that's used him?

24:58.503 --> 25:01.520
Confidentiality is the core of what we do.

25:01.896 --> 25:04.341
Look, Miss Lee.

25:04.341 --> 25:06.429
This is a murder investigation.

25:06.429 --> 25:12.270
We need to be in contact with anyone
who was conceived using donor 305.

25:12.270 --> 25:14.299
Those records are closed.

25:14.299 --> 25:17.395
- We'll come back with a subpoena.
- It won't make a difference.

25:17.395 --> 25:19.254
The law's the law.

25:20.360 --> 25:23.951
D.A.'s office says we can't get a subpoena
for sperm bank records.

25:23.951 --> 25:26.120
They've been through this a lot.

25:26.661 --> 25:29.301
Well, Rush could have
hundreds of kids out there.

25:29.301 --> 25:30.719
I mean, where do we even start?

25:30.719 --> 25:34.866
Same place donor kids would start
if they got shut down by the sperm bank.

25:34.866 --> 25:36.259
Go online.

25:36.259 --> 25:38.217
It's a natural instinct to want
to find your parents.

25:38.217 --> 25:41.760
There's gotta be websites, chat rooms.

25:43.243 --> 25:47.206
Logan, you ever want to have kids?

25:47.437 --> 25:50.878
You know when we'll be able
to tell that we're partners?

25:50.878 --> 25:54.773
When we don't have to ask
each other a lot of questions.

25:55.900 --> 25:58.414
Okay, here we go. Donorsibs.com

25:58.414 --> 26:01.559
A registry for children
conceived by sperm donors.

26:01.559 --> 26:07.710
They're comparing donor profiles,
searching for half-siblings.

26:07.710 --> 26:10.730
Ah, children of donor #305,

26:10.730 --> 26:13.263
and they'll have a standing date to play pool.

26:15.166 --> 26:17.486
We all made contact in different ways.

26:17.486 --> 26:19.963
Some of us knew which sperm bank
our mothers used.

26:19.963 --> 26:21.823
And what about the others?

26:21.823 --> 26:23.797
Well, it turns out we had a lot in common.

26:23.797 --> 26:27.567
We're all really good at languages.
Play an instrument.

26:27.918 --> 26:30.410
Do you have any idea
how many of you are out there?

26:30.410 --> 26:32.756
At least a dozen, from all over.

26:32.756 --> 26:35.878
We once heard from somebody
who moved to Nepal with his mother.

26:35.878 --> 26:37.303
Let me ask you something,

26:37.303 --> 26:39.098
How can you really be sure
that you're related?

26:39.098 --> 26:41.470
Do you send out your DNA
to be compared, or...

26:41.470 --> 26:43.577
Some people did. Not all.

26:43.577 --> 26:44.641
I did.

26:44.641 --> 26:46.950
There was this one guy
who was really into that.

26:46.950 --> 26:49.995
He wanted us to send a sample to a lab.

26:49.995 --> 26:52.104
- Who was that, Ben?
- Well, we never met him.

26:52.104 --> 26:54.607
But he got in touch with us
through donorsibs.

26:54.607 --> 26:57.230
Ben thinks he might have been our father.

26:57.911 --> 26:59.718
Who else would care that much?

26:59.718 --> 27:01.227
He asked us all these questions

27:01.227 --> 27:02.975
about who we were
and what our lives were like.

27:02.975 --> 27:05.836
- He asked a lot of medical questions.
- Medical questions?

27:05.836 --> 27:09.254
He wanted to know about our health.
Like he was a doctor.

27:09.254 --> 27:11.520
That's why I'm sure he was our father.

27:11.520 --> 27:13.366
His profile said he was a med student.

27:13.366 --> 27:16.924
So this guy wanted you
to send in a DNA swab?

27:16.924 --> 27:19.584
Actually, he wanted a blood sample.

27:19.584 --> 27:23.397
He had access to a lab,
and said he could process it right away.

27:24.037 --> 27:26.169
See, he has to be our dad.

27:26.169 --> 27:28.568
Some day he's gonna
get in touch with us.

27:32.400 --> 27:35.097
Do you have the address of that lab, Ben?

27:36.170 --> 27:39.577
So you... you can't make it?

27:40.886 --> 27:44.089
No, don't worry about it, man.

27:44.291 --> 27:46.720
I'll have another birthday next year.

27:48.914 --> 27:52.406
Yeah, I'm hanging in there.

27:52.807 --> 27:57.814
So just keep doing what you need to do,

27:57.814 --> 28:00.371
and I'll keep doing what I need to do.

28:00.940 --> 28:03.926
Okay. See ya.

28:14.065 --> 28:17.449
All six kids from the pool hall
volunteered DNA.

28:17.449 --> 28:18.747
They're all Eli's kids,

28:18.747 --> 28:21.686
but none matched the unknown blood
at the crime scene.

28:21.686 --> 28:23.370
So where does that leave us?

28:23.370 --> 28:26.207
The only leads we have at the moment
are these emails,

28:26.207 --> 28:29.257
which these kids want to believe
are from their father.

28:29.257 --> 28:31.197
- Any reason to think they are?
- None.

28:31.197 --> 28:34.238
This guy isn't interested in anything
beyond his own reflection.

28:34.238 --> 28:37.889
To some people, that's all children are...
mirror image.

28:37.889 --> 28:40.709
- But younger and without the baggage.
- Okay.

28:40.930 --> 28:44.459
Now, it turns out the emails aren't
from Eli's server anyway.

28:44.459 --> 28:46.146
They're from a bunch of
different IP addresses.

28:46.146 --> 28:48.889
- The sender kept moving around.
- Speaking of addresses,

28:48.889 --> 28:51.629
we get one yet for that lab
the kids were sending their DNA to?

28:51.629 --> 28:53.312
Mm-hmm. Deja vu.

28:53.312 --> 28:55.801
Turns out we've been there already.

28:56.009 --> 28:58.505
It's where Tom Pittino works.

28:59.502 --> 29:01.077
You ran blood tests on these kids?

29:01.077 --> 29:02.830
Yeah, I recognize a couple of the names.

29:02.830 --> 29:05.150
- Who asked you to do it?
- Tom Pittino.

29:05.150 --> 29:07.764
He was doing a research
project on DNA profiles.

29:07.764 --> 29:10.572
Tom Pittino.
Can you go get him?

29:10.572 --> 29:13.435
Sorry. He up and left about
an hour and a half ago.

29:13.435 --> 29:14.638
Didn't even wait for his paycheck.

29:14.638 --> 29:16.893
Do you have any idea
where he might have gone?

29:17.109 --> 29:18.974
No. But if you find him,

29:18.974 --> 29:23.188
tell him there's a lot of anxious people
waiting to talk to him about their DNA.

29:24.743 --> 29:28.530
Trouble is it's his DNA we're interested in.

29:29.194 --> 29:32.977
Tom Pittino spent how many years
in a quest for his sperm donor father?

29:32.977 --> 29:34.438
At least the last six.

29:34.438 --> 29:36.829
Here's Tom's freshman college I.D.

29:36.829 --> 29:39.974
Here's his I.D. for his first job
at an ancestry website.

29:39.974 --> 29:41.692
He had access to their database.

29:41.692 --> 29:43.760
He used that to start narrowing the field.

29:43.760 --> 29:47.031
And next stop, Hudson school of
medicine, alumni office.

29:47.031 --> 29:49.149
Dr. Rush's alma mater.

29:49.149 --> 29:51.194
How did he figure that one out?

29:51.194 --> 29:53.702
His siblings knew their mother's cryobank.

29:53.702 --> 29:56.559
Hudson was one of the two
medical schools in the neighborhood.

29:56.559 --> 30:00.123
Last year, Tom gets his current job
at Metropolitan Genetics.

30:00.123 --> 30:03.906
By now, he'd zeroed in
on a handful of potential donors.

30:03.906 --> 30:07.349
We figure he probably stalked them
to get their DNA off

30:07.349 --> 30:09.714
a piece of gum, maybe a coffee cup.

30:09.714 --> 30:12.703
Once he IDed Rush as his genetic father,

30:12.703 --> 30:15.417
he had himself assigned
to Rush as a counselor.

30:15.417 --> 30:18.825
Say Pittino did finally
track down his biological father.

30:18.825 --> 30:21.201
How does his biological
uncle end up dead?

30:21.201 --> 30:22.485
That's what we wanna know too.

30:22.485 --> 30:25.851
We have teams staking out
Metropolitan Genetics and his apartment.

30:25.851 --> 30:27.326
How 'bout his mother's apartment?

30:27.326 --> 30:31.073
His mother died in '99 of leukemia.

30:31.073 --> 30:35.808
His father last appears
on his freshman financial aid form.

30:35.808 --> 30:39.136
John Lucas.
He runs a construction outfit.

30:39.136 --> 30:42.461
This kid was able to track down
his anonymous donor father.

30:42.461 --> 30:45.109
You ought to be able
to track down Lucas.

30:47.023 --> 30:48.950
Tom grew up thinking
I was his real father.

30:48.950 --> 30:52.411
I didn't tell him the truth
till he hit me up for college money.

30:52.411 --> 30:53.881
Why wait so long?

30:53.881 --> 30:56.690
His mother didn't want him and his brother
to know they were baster babies.

30:56.690 --> 30:59.418
Baster babies?
You raised them as your own.

30:59.418 --> 31:02.504
Yeah, but Tom and I never bonded.

31:02.504 --> 31:05.341
I think he was relieved
to find out he wasn't mine.

31:05.341 --> 31:08.117
I take it you two have not been in touch.

31:08.117 --> 31:10.394
No, last time he called was
about three years ago.

31:10.394 --> 31:11.870
Another favor.

31:11.870 --> 31:13.517
This time he says his little brother's sick.

31:13.517 --> 31:16.746
He needs medical information
about their genetic father.

31:16.746 --> 31:18.806
I told him what little I remembered.

31:18.806 --> 31:21.287
And that's all the help you gave him?

31:21.287 --> 31:24.192
Hey, I got two of my own
to worry about now.

31:24.192 --> 31:26.405
They fixed the problem
with my delivery pipeline.

31:26.405 --> 31:28.699
All right, so you haven't
talked to Tom since?

31:28.699 --> 31:30.165
No.

31:30.517 --> 31:32.507
Hey, what about the younger brother?

31:32.507 --> 31:33.976
Ralph?

31:34.664 --> 31:38.752
Great kid.
I was sorry to hear he was sick.

31:38.752 --> 31:41.505
Last time I heard he was
in a hospital in Queens.

31:41.505 --> 31:43.558
I sent him a card.

31:46.109 --> 31:48.050
Sensitive guy.

31:51.078 --> 31:53.645
Wiskott Aldrich syndrome.

31:53.645 --> 31:59.628
It's okay if you don't mind low platelet counts
and a leaky immune system.

31:59.829 --> 32:01.220
I'm dealing.

32:01.220 --> 32:06.254
Has your brother Tom told you
what he's been up to in his lab?

32:06.254 --> 32:09.366
I know he's working with a lot of doctors.

32:09.366 --> 32:11.402
Trying to get me better.

32:11.402 --> 32:12.791
Where is Tom?

32:12.791 --> 32:16.996
One of those doctors has been trying
to get in touch with him.

32:19.883 --> 32:21.437
I never know where he is.

32:21.437 --> 32:24.674
He's listed here as your next of kin.

32:25.475 --> 32:27.559
Small family.

32:29.028 --> 32:30.464
Listen, I'm getting kinda tired.

32:30.464 --> 32:33.700
Could you guys close the door
on your way out?

32:34.483 --> 32:36.631
Detectives, please, he's wiped out.

32:36.631 --> 32:38.320
Yeah, sure.

32:43.629 --> 32:46.644
Nurse, how sick is he?

32:46.644 --> 32:50.581
Without a bone marrow transplant,
maybe three months to live.

32:50.581 --> 32:53.363
It's a shame his brother isn't a match.

32:59.911 --> 33:02.229
A courier brought this.

33:03.155 --> 33:05.719
And those detectives
are still in the waiting room.

33:05.719 --> 33:07.774
- They're not leaving.
- I'm not talking to them.

33:07.774 --> 33:10.507
- Give them my lawyer's number.
- They seem pretty persistent.

33:10.507 --> 33:12.254
Get rid of them, Helen.

33:12.254 --> 33:14.148
Yes, Dr. Rush.

33:14.148 --> 33:15.853
You want the sample brought
into the other room?

33:15.853 --> 33:18.389
Don't worry about it.
I'll take care of it.

33:43.138 --> 33:45.615
I'm sorry. The doctor must
have gone out the back.

33:45.615 --> 33:47.473
He was due in surgery.

33:47.473 --> 33:49.771
Here's his attorney's number.

33:55.015 --> 33:56.264
You want this?

33:56.264 --> 34:02.375
Logan, you notice anything unusual
about the way these babies look?

34:02.375 --> 34:05.185
Don't all babies look the same, Falacci?

34:05.185 --> 34:08.409
There were 300 people
in my high school graduating class,

34:08.409 --> 34:11.047
maybe nine other redheads.

34:11.047 --> 34:16.427
I count that many in just 65 pictures
here on this wall.

34:39.831 --> 34:43.992
Eli Rush impregnated dozens of
patients with his own sperm.

34:43.992 --> 34:44.913
Why?

34:44.913 --> 34:48.096
He's a raging egomaniac
with a god complex.

34:48.096 --> 34:50.378
Okay. And Tom Pittino?

34:50.378 --> 34:54.032
We think Tom took the job
so that he could bond with Eli.

34:54.032 --> 34:56.103
In order to get Eli to donate bone marrow.

34:56.103 --> 34:57.541
While Tom's working there,

34:57.541 --> 35:00.115
he starts to notice that a lot of the babies
born into the practice

35:00.115 --> 35:02.375
share Eli's DNA profile.

35:02.375 --> 35:04.354
And did he try to use this as leverage?

35:04.354 --> 35:06.478
Well, if he did it didn't work.

35:06.478 --> 35:10.490
Ralph's still sick.
And Eli, he couldn't care less.

35:10.490 --> 35:12.880
So Eli turned Tom down.

35:12.880 --> 35:15.318
And somehow Zach Rush turned up dead?

35:15.318 --> 35:17.025
Well, here's what we're thinking.

35:17.025 --> 35:19.333
Tom visits uncle Zach, right?

35:19.333 --> 35:21.953
So he outs Eli,
hoping that Zach's gonna help.

35:21.953 --> 35:25.389
Zach confronts Eli.
Eli's a total narcissist.

35:25.389 --> 35:28.634
He'd kill his own brother
to save his reputation.

35:29.902 --> 35:32.218
- Tom's still AWOL?
- Yeah.

35:32.218 --> 35:34.481
We're gonna need him to shake Eli.

35:34.481 --> 35:36.513
Call Ralph, tell him
his brother's in trouble,

35:36.513 --> 35:39.105
have him set up a family reunion.

35:39.105 --> 35:40.541
Got it.

35:43.468 --> 35:46.831
Dad, you've never even seen me.

35:48.039 --> 35:49.736
Don't you have anything
you want to say?

35:49.736 --> 35:52.510
You said your brother wanted to talk to me
or he was going to the police.

35:52.510 --> 35:54.624
Now where is he?

35:55.699 --> 35:58.230
Can I at least have a glass of water?

36:03.128 --> 36:04.474
Hey, Ralph.

36:04.474 --> 36:07.471
- Eli.
- It's about time you got here.

36:08.475 --> 36:10.631
What the hell is he doing here?

36:11.602 --> 36:12.743
Wasn't this your idea?

36:12.743 --> 36:14.877
Actually, it was ours, doc.

36:14.877 --> 36:18.383
So I take it you've met your two sons.

36:19.180 --> 36:20.897
All right.

36:20.897 --> 36:23.133
Yes, I was a donor.

36:23.133 --> 36:28.286
And Tom stalked me with the misguided notion
that I'd be a father to him.

36:29.522 --> 36:31.497
You have my lawyer's
phone number, detectives.

36:31.497 --> 36:33.375
Excuse me.
I have a baby to deliver.

36:33.375 --> 36:36.855
A baby. Congratulations.
Another son or this time a daughter?

36:36.855 --> 36:38.318
I don't know what you're talking about.

36:38.318 --> 36:40.957
Oh, well, see that's why we thought
this reunion might be helpful.

36:40.957 --> 36:42.031
But if you have to go,

36:42.031 --> 36:44.288
I'm sure Tom could probably
give us a lot of the answers we need.

36:44.288 --> 36:46.014
I don't follow either, detectives.

36:46.014 --> 36:47.180
Hey, Eli.

36:47.180 --> 36:50.663
We're on to your whole
Johnny appleseed routine, okay?

36:50.663 --> 36:53.141
Yeah, how many gingers
do you have out there anyway?

36:53.141 --> 36:54.661
Hundreds? Maybe a thousand?

36:54.661 --> 36:56.457
Whatever he told you, he's lying.

36:56.457 --> 36:58.753
Well, if he's lying it must be genetic.

36:58.753 --> 37:01.297
Not only were you gaving an affair
with your brother's wife.

37:01.297 --> 37:03.186
You also inseminated his patients.

37:03.186 --> 37:04.852
He confronted you.
You killed him.

37:04.852 --> 37:06.688
That's why your blood was
at the crime scene.

37:06.688 --> 37:09.648
No, you tell them the truth, Tom.

37:09.648 --> 37:10.870
He was angry.

37:10.870 --> 37:14.410
Because I wouldn't let them
dig out my bone marrow for a stranger.

37:14.410 --> 37:17.844
Then he tried to blackmail me
with a bunch of phony lab results.

37:17.844 --> 37:19.735
I had to throw him out of my office.

37:19.735 --> 37:22.484
And once everybody was gone,
he came back for Zach.

37:22.484 --> 37:24.037
After my brother's funeral,

37:24.037 --> 37:28.309
he said if I'd keep his secret,
he'd keep mine.

37:28.309 --> 37:30.283
Say something already.

37:30.500 --> 37:32.659
Okay, uh, Tom.

37:32.659 --> 37:34.913
Where were you when Zach was killed?

37:34.913 --> 37:36.422
He was here.

37:36.422 --> 37:38.749
With me, visiting.

37:39.269 --> 37:41.529
Go back inside, Ralph.

37:41.857 --> 37:43.743
Now see, here's the thing, Tom.

37:43.743 --> 37:46.910
We can arrest Eli for murder,
but is that what you really want?

37:46.910 --> 37:51.932
Is that why you spent the last three years
hunting him down?

37:52.387 --> 37:55.622
Yeah, when people need
something from each other,

37:55.622 --> 37:58.105
there's usually a way
of working things out.

37:58.105 --> 37:59.344
What is that supposed to mean?

37:59.344 --> 38:02.297
It means your son Ralph
needs a bone marrow transplant.

38:02.297 --> 38:05.062
He is not my son.

38:05.062 --> 38:06.140
No?

38:06.140 --> 38:09.445
You marrow is the only
perfect match I found.

38:09.445 --> 38:11.624
Forget him, Tom.

38:16.201 --> 38:18.858
If he donates, I'll talk.

38:18.858 --> 38:21.248
Are you all blackmailing me?

38:21.248 --> 38:23.684
What's it gonna be, Eli?

38:23.955 --> 38:25.761
You gonna do the right thing?

38:25.761 --> 38:27.374
Or are we gonna arrest you for murder?

38:27.374 --> 38:30.348
I don't owe them anything.
I gave them life.

38:30.348 --> 38:33.518
Doctor, this is your son.
Look at him.

38:33.518 --> 38:36.133
I am not doing this in front of him.

38:36.422 --> 38:38.915
Ralph, let me handle this.

38:56.851 --> 38:59.053
This disease, he got it from his mother.

38:59.053 --> 39:00.899
But you could save him.

39:00.899 --> 39:04.078
Do you know how much
a bone marrow surgery hurts?

39:04.078 --> 39:05.510
I've never been good with pain.

39:05.510 --> 39:08.096
One thing Ralph didn't get from you.

39:10.251 --> 39:12.568
Just give me the donation papers.
Let's get this over with.

39:12.568 --> 39:14.478
You tell them what they wanna know.

39:14.478 --> 39:16.293
I don't trust you.
So what if you sign?

39:16.293 --> 39:18.626
Tom, anything you tell us
is off the record.

39:18.626 --> 39:22.716
Eli is liable for murder
until Ralph gets the bone marrow.

39:27.213 --> 39:29.853
I used to just wonder
where I came from.

39:29.853 --> 39:33.210
I knew our father wasn't really our father.

39:33.210 --> 39:35.623
Then he abandoned us after mom died.

39:35.623 --> 39:37.436
So you started your hunt?

39:37.436 --> 39:40.674
It was just a fantasy
until Ralph got sick.

39:41.332 --> 39:43.434
I thought if I found my dad

39:43.434 --> 39:46.716
and he was a match,
he couldn't turn us down.

39:46.716 --> 39:49.248
His profile said he was
gonna be a doctor.

39:49.248 --> 39:51.226
What do you want?

39:51.226 --> 39:53.301
If I gave something to
every kid with my DNA,

39:53.301 --> 39:54.829
there'd be nothing left of me.

39:54.829 --> 39:56.096
All right, hold on.

39:56.096 --> 39:59.610
Tom, this is the part of
the equation I don't get.

39:59.610 --> 40:01.452
Why kill Zach?

40:01.452 --> 40:04.616
- Was he a match?
- No.

40:04.616 --> 40:06.889
I'd already checked.

40:09.688 --> 40:12.284
But after Eli turned me down,

40:12.284 --> 40:16.496
I went to Zach and I begged him
to talk to his brother.

40:17.913 --> 40:21.029
He said that he had been
cleaning up your messes his whole life

40:21.029 --> 40:22.676
and he couldn't get involved.

40:22.676 --> 40:24.616
We started to argue and he said

40:24.616 --> 40:28.917
that if I was looking for you to be a father,
that I should forget it.

40:28.917 --> 40:31.918
That I would never be a part of your family.

40:36.565 --> 40:38.849
I snapped.

40:41.262 --> 40:45.547
I didn't realize I'd grabbed the cube
until I saw it in my hand.

40:45.547 --> 40:47.688
Bloody.

40:50.764 --> 40:53.298
Crime of passion?

40:54.916 --> 40:57.988
Covered up the crime scene, huh?

40:58.278 --> 41:01.648
He was... he was bleeding pretty badly.
I panicked.

41:01.648 --> 41:04.065
So you dragged the body
to the exam room.

41:04.065 --> 41:05.997
You tied him up on the table,

41:05.997 --> 41:08.200
and tried to make it look like
a political statement?

41:08.200 --> 41:10.274
What? No.

41:10.554 --> 41:14.937
Zach was dead.
I ran out of there.

41:14.937 --> 41:18.037
I went home and I cried.

41:21.528 --> 41:24.719
I finally found what I'd been looking for.

41:25.081 --> 41:27.359
And it broke my heart.

41:30.997 --> 41:34.033
Oh, you can't believe him.
He's a killer.

41:35.544 --> 41:38.070
But you had too much to hide.

41:38.070 --> 41:40.452
The bleach on the blood stain.

41:40.452 --> 41:43.699
You didn't want us to find out
you had a son.

41:43.699 --> 41:45.651
Eli.

41:45.651 --> 41:48.449
You trussed up your own brother?

41:48.676 --> 41:52.555
He was dead.
I checked.

41:52.555 --> 41:55.158
So what if I restaged the scene?

41:55.158 --> 41:57.598
Tom's your murderer.
Arrest him.

41:57.598 --> 42:01.811
All right, just so you know,
everything is still off the record.

42:01.811 --> 42:03.420
Deal's a deal.

42:03.420 --> 42:05.662
Right, Tom?

42:06.756 --> 42:08.237
You have my word.

42:08.237 --> 42:10.648
You're not gonna make me do this.

42:10.648 --> 42:13.074
Well, we can't make you do it.

42:13.926 --> 42:17.828
But Eli, what can you do?

42:17.828 --> 42:19.867
It's family.
