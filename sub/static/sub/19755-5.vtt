03:00.780 --> 03:02.410
All right, let's go!

03:05.160 --> 03:08.000
Finish everything,
so we can start arranging everything.

03:10.620 --> 03:11.670
Chop-chop!

03:11.750 --> 03:14.420
Don't think.
Just do what you're told.

03:25.680 --> 03:27.640
Come on. Come on.
Take it and then chop chop.

03:29.350 --> 03:31.900
Come on!
Pull! Pull! Pull!

03:33.400 --> 03:36.730
Move your fucking ass
and bring me the palette knife.

03:46.120 --> 03:50.540
Look, guys!
Stand like this! Nothing else.

04:01.380 --> 04:04.010
Take the plate.

04:04.090 --> 04:07.560
You come here with the plate.
You put the plate right here. Okay?

07:25.130 --> 07:27.630
It tastes like nothing.

07:28.380 --> 07:31.880
It's not going to infuse the fish.
It has to be hotter. It's too sweet.

07:33.550 --> 07:35.720
You can't taste it.

07:37.520 --> 07:40.140
It's cooked well,
but it's missing the oomph.

08:28.940 --> 08:30.360
Nothing.

08:31.610 --> 08:33.030
Not hot at all.

08:34.610 --> 08:36.120
Not hot, guys.

08:49.630 --> 08:51.000
You have to pay attention. Really!

08:51.090 --> 08:52.840
It sucks when everything
tastes like nothing.

08:53.760 --> 08:55.590
Then our food will become irrelevant.

08:56.470 --> 08:58.180
It tastes like diet food.

09:08.060 --> 09:09.940
A little bit more.

09:10.020 --> 09:12.240
Twice as much
as you have already used.

09:12.320 --> 09:13.860
It has to burn.

14:30.720 --> 14:32.560
Three zanders. Hurry up.
Table eight!

14:34.970 --> 14:37.520
Just take it.
Table eight. Chop-chop!

14:53.030 --> 14:55.120
Caviar is ready.

14:55.200 --> 14:57.040
I don't give a fuck.
Just make the fish.

15:37.540 --> 15:40.410
What's missing is a lot of salt.

15:52.180 --> 15:54.430
It tastes a little weak.

16:02.900 --> 16:03.940
Very nice!

16:04.020 --> 16:05.610
Now bring it to a short boil.

16:50.860 --> 16:52.240
It's very good.

16:53.820 --> 17:00.120
Those two just need
a little guidance still.

17:00.200 --> 17:01.410
Thanks.

22:05.550 --> 22:09.300
Muci, remember when we used to eat kebabs?
They never looked like this.

22:09.390 --> 22:10.930
We've all improved, too.

22:14.020 --> 22:15.850
Are there any special ingredients in it?

22:15.930 --> 22:18.020
Including Turkish peppers?

22:18.940 --> 22:23.190
Only the best. That's the truth.

25:30.960 --> 25:33.420
So, now you can all take a minute,

25:33.510 --> 25:36.380
and I'll teach you
how to fillet a fish properly.

25:38.850 --> 25:43.430
What normally happens
is you cut away the stomach flap

25:43.520 --> 25:44.930
and then pull out bones.

25:45.850 --> 25:49.690
There's nothing to say
against this per se,

25:49.770 --> 25:51.190
only that it's not interesting to us,

25:51.270 --> 25:54.740
because what we want
is located here and here.

25:54.820 --> 25:56.400
That is the pure fillet.

25:57.530 --> 25:59.200
This is why, at one point,

25:59.280 --> 26:03.790
I developed a way to cut up the fish
in such a way that it works for us.

26:40.950 --> 26:44.990
And we have a perfect white fillet.

28:20.130 --> 28:21.420
Like this?

28:21.510 --> 28:24.470
I don't think we've ever
arranged food differently.

28:24.550 --> 28:27.140
Except for the dots.
Those sometimes get bigger or smaller.

28:27.220 --> 28:30.220
Depending on how salty
Christopher's dashi turns out.

28:30.310 --> 28:32.230
Did I put too much salt
in something again?

28:32.310 --> 28:33.900
As always.

29:42.840 --> 29:45.010
Hey, good morning.

30:26.590 --> 30:28.010
Not bad!

30:32.470 --> 30:34.470
So, a beautiful good morning, gentlemen!

31:07.550 --> 31:10.760
Let's think about

31:10.840 --> 31:14.140
what we could do with the salmon.

31:17.140 --> 31:21.270
It looks like we could make
sushi or sashimi out of it.

32:02.350 --> 32:06.980
-What was that?
-That was papaya with this.

34:03.600 --> 34:07.940
Today I'm serving
foie gras with matcha green tea.

34:08.810 --> 34:10.480
Please go ahead and try it.

34:10.570 --> 34:11.570
Many thanks.

34:46.480 --> 34:48.310
Have a good service.

36:46.800 --> 36:51.680
What is the special taste
in the dish I had earlier?

36:51.770 --> 36:53.810
That's a secret.

36:58.020 --> 37:00.740
You should try this.
It's shrimp.

37:00.820 --> 37:02.860
With or without shell?

37:02.950 --> 37:06.990
You can eat it in the shell
if your stomach can take it. It's crunchy.
