WEBVTT

01:23.701 --> 01:26.704
That takes
a load off my mind.

01:29.242 --> 01:31.209
Thank you.

01:43.721 --> 01:46.224
Hi.

01:46.259 --> 01:48.726
Thank you, mr. Bueller.

01:49.227 --> 01:51.229
Can I help you?

01:51.264 --> 01:53.731
-Can I have five twenty's, please?
-Sure.

01:55.233 --> 01:58.486
Ok, that's 20, 40...

01:58.521 --> 02:01.422
60, 80 ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ 100.

02:01.457 --> 02:03.708
-There you go.
-Thank you.

02:03.743 --> 02:05.710
-You're welcome.
-Bye-bye.

02:05.745 --> 02:07.712
Bye.

03:21.187 --> 03:23.654
Bad idea.

03:25.156 --> 03:26.657
Frank salazar!

03:27.158 --> 03:30.161
You're under arrest!

03:30.196 --> 03:32.663
Havin' one of
those days, frank?

03:43.209 --> 03:45.176
Son of a bitch.

04:42.066 --> 04:44.068
Ahh.

06:02.396 --> 06:04.398
All aboard!

06:20.498 --> 06:23.000
Need a ride, gentlemen?

06:30.508 --> 06:33.010
How much farther
we got?

06:33.045 --> 06:35.012
'Bout 60 miles.

06:41.018 --> 06:42.520
You're max greene,
aren't ya?

06:42.555 --> 06:46.023
Yeah.
Yeah, i thought so.

06:46.524 --> 06:49.527
Frank told me about you
last job i worked with him.

06:50.027 --> 06:53.531
Said you were the best explosives
man he'd ever worked with.

06:54.031 --> 06:55.533
I'm ray.
Ray forgy.

07:00.538 --> 07:02.039
You're carlos barrios,
right?

07:05.042 --> 07:07.545
Frank told you about me too? No.

07:07.580 --> 07:10.548
Soledad. I was there
same time you were.

07:13.050 --> 07:15.052
What about him?

07:15.087 --> 07:18.556
You seem to know everybody here. Who's he?

07:18.591 --> 07:20.558
Don't know him.

07:20.593 --> 07:22.560
You don't know him?
No.

07:22.595 --> 07:25.563
- I don't know him either.
- Me neither.

07:28.065 --> 07:32.069
Doesn't seem fair us not knowing who
he is now that he knows who we are.

07:35.573 --> 07:38.576
I guess i'm not as famous
as you guys.

07:38.611 --> 07:43.581
Nick bartkowski. Glad to meet ya.
Now we can all be best friends, huh?

07:44.081 --> 07:48.085
Wake me when we get there, then
i'll get your fuckin' autographs.

08:14.146 --> 08:17.031
So, who gets to
do the honors?

08:24.038 --> 08:26.040
Figures.

09:07.581 --> 09:10.584
Knock on
the fuckin' door.

09:41.031 --> 09:42.533
This is bullshit!

09:45.035 --> 09:48.539
Frank would've
been here to meet us.

09:50.541 --> 09:52.543
Hey, i did my part.

10:35.052 --> 10:36.554
Hmm.

10:37.054 --> 10:41.559
Don't look at me, pal. There's
too much lead in that house now.

11:03.080 --> 11:05.583
Wha- god- god!

11:48.876 --> 11:50.377
Hey. Whoa. Whoa.

11:50.412 --> 11:52.379
Whoa!

12:09.396 --> 12:12.900
This is it. Frank's stuff's in the bedroom.

12:12.935 --> 12:15.903
- Then where the hell is frank?
- Maybe he found a woman.

12:16.403 --> 12:18.405
Hmm.
Frank would've been here.

12:18.906 --> 12:20.908
That depends
on the woman.

12:21.408 --> 12:23.911
This is a bad sign.
A bad sign.

12:23.946 --> 12:27.281
I do not like starting jobs
with bad signs.

12:27.316 --> 12:31.285
- Maybe the woman's husband came home and shot him.
- No, this isn't like frank.

12:31.320 --> 12:34.288
Frank would've been here.
I say we get the hell out.

12:34.323 --> 12:38.292
I came a long way for this job. I
think we should give frank a few hours.

12:38.327 --> 12:41.295
If he doesn't show
by morning,

12:41.330 --> 12:43.297
then we'll decide.

12:43.332 --> 12:47.301
I don't feel like going back before
i find out what i came here for.

12:47.336 --> 12:49.203
You?

12:50.805 --> 12:52.873
Yeah, i can hang
for a night.

12:52.908 --> 12:56.727
So you guys take a vote,
that's it, huh? I'm stuck here.

12:56.762 --> 12:59.230
You should be proud
to live in a democracy.

12:59.265 --> 13:02.233
The only thing i'm proud of is that i'm
not in jail, and i wanna keep it that way.

13:02.733 --> 13:06.237
So do i. If i go back inside a
cell again, that'll be it for me.

13:06.272 --> 13:08.739
I don't have the time
to make mistakes.

13:08.774 --> 13:11.242
The only reason i'm here
is 'cause of frank.

13:11.277 --> 13:14.461
The only reason frank
would've come here is a setup.

13:14.496 --> 13:16.297
Frank is particular...

13:16.797 --> 13:19.300
about his setups
and about his people.

13:19.733 --> 13:22.369
Me and frank worked
together eight times.

13:22.770 --> 13:24.555
I don't know any of ya.

13:25.556 --> 13:28.976
Frank told me aboutyou,
and you.

13:29.011 --> 13:31.979
But you...

13:34.481 --> 13:36.483
i don't know.

13:36.518 --> 13:39.486
I have nothing against you,
but you're young.

13:39.521 --> 13:41.989
And i don't like
working with young.

13:42.024 --> 13:45.159
The risks don't
add up the same.

13:45.194 --> 13:49.663
You're here because frank wanted you
here, and that means you're not stupid.

13:49.698 --> 13:53.167
Stupid people make stupid mistakes
and wind up getting caught.

13:53.202 --> 13:56.670
No matter how smart you are, the
cops wind up on your doorstep.

13:56.705 --> 13:58.672
Smartest thing
i ever did...

14:00.674 --> 14:03.677
was to stop working
with stupid people.

14:03.712 --> 14:06.680
So, that's why
we wait.

14:06.715 --> 14:11.135
- Who died and made you boss?
- Nobody made me nothin'. It's the way it's gonna be.

14:11.635 --> 14:14.638
- When you take a job, you stick it out 'til the end.
- What job?

14:15.139 --> 14:18.142
- Does anybody know why the hell we're here?
- Doesn't make any difference.

14:18.642 --> 14:21.645
- As long as you're with us, you stick it out.
- For how long?

14:21.680 --> 14:25.149
Until we decide it's over.
All of us.

14:30.404 --> 14:33.407
It's 11:00.
I'm tired.

14:33.442 --> 14:36.410
We keep the lights out,
and someone stays up.

14:36.445 --> 14:39.914
Frank might show. If he does,
i don't want any surprises.

14:39.949 --> 14:43.918
Put the car in the garage. No
reason to advertise we're here.

14:45.419 --> 14:47.421
Any problems with that?

14:48.422 --> 14:51.926
We do two-hour shifts.
Change at 1:00, 3:00 and 5:00.

14:51.961 --> 14:55.429
I'll take the first one.
I can't sleep before 1:00.

14:55.464 --> 14:57.431
I'll take second.
Third.

14:57.466 --> 14:59.934
You get last.

14:59.969 --> 15:01.936
And what if frank
doesn't show?

15:01.971 --> 15:04.438
Stop thinkin', nick.
Doesn't do anybody any good.

15:07.441 --> 15:09.443
I'll sleep my first couple
of hours in the bed.

15:09.478 --> 15:12.947
- Don't waste time looking for another. There's only one.
- You're gonna need keys.

15:14.448 --> 15:18.953
No, i'm not. I left 'em in
the car. Uh, i don't think so.

15:18.988 --> 15:22.957
And nick here didn't want one of
us stealing the car. Did you, nick?

15:31.966 --> 15:34.468
See, you can't be
too careful nowadays.

15:34.969 --> 15:38.973
- You don't know who you can trust anymore.
- You got something to say?

15:39.974 --> 15:42.476
I got nothing to say.

15:42.511 --> 15:45.980
Don't wanna start things off
with a... bad sign.

15:50.985 --> 15:52.486
Ohh.

15:55.990 --> 15:58.492
One big, happy family.

15:59.994 --> 16:01.996
Maybe we'll get together
next christmas,

16:02.031 --> 16:05.499
remember the good times,
the warm, friendly faces.

16:10.504 --> 16:12.506
"Bad sign."

16:30.274 --> 16:34.278
I don't know what you're trying
to prove, but don't push it.

16:37.781 --> 16:39.783
Something bad
might happen, huh?

16:39.818 --> 16:44.288
Something bad might happen.
It might happen to y-

16:52.296 --> 16:55.299
i don't care who you
think you are, you're-

16:58.302 --> 17:02.806
i'm leaving the bags right here, 'cause
i'm not playing bellboy, you know?

17:06.810 --> 17:10.314
I know you're trying to
get me to lose my-

17:10.348 --> 17:12.816
one of you got some
toothpaste i can borrow?

17:12.851 --> 17:14.318
Yes, i've got
some fucking toothpaste!

17:21.325 --> 17:23.327
What's he freakin' out
about?

17:23.362 --> 17:27.330
I'm not sure. I think
he wanted to kill me.

17:27.366 --> 17:29.583
Oh.

17:35.256 --> 17:37.258
Shit.

18:22.803 --> 18:25.806
Ah, it's a beautiful day,
isn't it, frank?

18:25.841 --> 18:27.608
Heh-heh.
Smell that air.

18:27.643 --> 18:30.110
It's clean.

18:30.145 --> 18:32.112
Not like back home,
huh?

18:32.147 --> 18:35.616
Better take some deep
breaths while you can.

18:35.651 --> 18:38.118
Come on, frank, admit it.
Didn't you miss newark?

18:38.153 --> 18:41.121
Not newark, george. He didn't
miss newark. He missed us.

18:41.156 --> 18:44.625
Am i right?
I'm right.

18:44.660 --> 18:49.396
Come on. Our life just hasn't
been the same without you, frank.

19:11.053 --> 19:13.020
Oh, god. Oh, god.
Oh, god.

19:16.023 --> 19:19.026
- Cops?
- I don't know- oww!

19:20.027 --> 19:22.029
God! Ohhh!

19:26.033 --> 19:29.536
- Where's it coming from?
- I can't see anything!

19:29.571 --> 19:31.538
Watch there.

19:32.039 --> 19:34.041
What the hell's
goin' on?

19:37.579 --> 19:41.048
Nothing on this side.
Here either.

19:41.548 --> 19:44.551
- Maybe it's frank! Maybe he's on the run!
- I'm goin' out.

19:45.052 --> 19:47.054
I'm with you.
Kid!

19:47.089 --> 19:49.056
- Yeah!
- Watch the front.

19:49.556 --> 19:52.059
- Where are you goin'?
- I told you, watch there!

20:04.872 --> 20:06.874
Where are they going?

20:06.909 --> 20:08.876
I don't know.
Maybe they saw somethin'.

20:16.383 --> 20:18.886
I knew something like this was
gonna happen. I knew it! I knew it!

20:28.896 --> 20:31.398
Ohh!

20:42.576 --> 20:44.578
Okay, here.

20:55.207 --> 20:58.175
So?
What do you see?

20:58.210 --> 21:00.177
It's a couple of kids.

21:00.212 --> 21:03.180
Kids?
Doing what?

21:03.215 --> 21:04.998
Shooting at bottles.

21:05.399 --> 21:08.302
They're not even
hitting them.

21:08.337 --> 21:10.137
We went through
all this for...

21:11.638 --> 21:13.640
kids shooting
at bottles.

21:15.609 --> 21:18.112
Shit.

21:21.150 --> 21:23.117
Where you going?

21:23.152 --> 21:26.620
I'm gonna shoot 'em.

21:30.874 --> 21:32.376
Shoot- uh-
shoot 'em?

21:32.876 --> 21:35.379
Uh, w-
wait a minute!

21:35.414 --> 21:38.382
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute!

21:38.417 --> 21:41.168
Wait a minute.
Wait-

21:41.203 --> 21:43.003
you don't know
how to shoot.

21:44.304 --> 21:46.306
Hey, watch out!

21:48.308 --> 21:50.677
Ohhh!

21:56.552 --> 21:59.520
I told you this was
gonna happen. I heard you!

22:00.521 --> 22:02.523
Gimme the keys.
What?

22:02.558 --> 22:04.525
The car keys. Get outta here. You're drunk.

22:05.025 --> 22:06.527
Gimme the keys!
We're not leavin' 'em!

22:07.027 --> 22:09.530
You wanna stay, stay.
I'm not asking your permission.

22:09.565 --> 22:11.532
Gimme the goddamn keys!

22:19.039 --> 22:21.542
Give 'em to me.
Now, you comin'?

22:21.577 --> 22:24.545
I'm not leavin'.
Give me the gun.

22:25.546 --> 22:28.048
Don't be stupid!
Gimme the gun!

22:34.555 --> 22:36.056
Thank you.

22:45.866 --> 22:48.869
First time i've seen
the ground in 15 years.

22:48.904 --> 22:50.704
Almost forgot
what it looked like.

22:50.739 --> 22:52.656
You from new york,
right?

22:52.691 --> 22:55.659
Yeah.
I lived there once.

22:55.694 --> 22:58.662
For three years
and seven months.

22:58.697 --> 23:02.466
Got time off
for good behavior.

23:02.501 --> 23:04.751
Where?
Attica.

23:07.054 --> 23:08.805
Me too.

23:08.840 --> 23:10.807
Did four there.

23:12.309 --> 23:14.595
Got out in '68.

23:14.630 --> 23:16.697
Class of '79.

23:17.648 --> 23:19.933
That's where
i met frank.

23:19.968 --> 23:23.804
- Hey!
He's taking the car!

23:23.839 --> 23:25.739
Nick's taking the car! Shit!

23:25.774 --> 23:30.744
He's taking the car!

23:46.545 --> 23:48.512
Son of a bitch!
Great!

23:51.550 --> 23:54.017
Great. Now what
are we gonna do?

23:57.521 --> 23:59.523
Nothin'.

24:00.023 --> 24:02.025
Nothing. We're just-

24:02.060 --> 24:04.528
we're just gonna
let him go?

24:04.563 --> 24:08.031
You chase him if you want.
I'm too old to outrun a car.

24:11.034 --> 24:14.538
Montana. What the hell
am i doin' in montana?

24:15.038 --> 24:18.041
Fuckin' bullshit.
I need a drink.

24:31.555 --> 24:33.557
What is this?

24:43.850 --> 24:46.353
Oh, shit, shit, shit,
shit, shit.

24:47.354 --> 24:49.356
Shit.

25:06.740 --> 25:09.626
Oh, no.

25:12.129 --> 25:14.631
Ohh!

25:14.666 --> 25:16.133
Fuck!

25:26.893 --> 25:28.895
I mean it, man.
Really.

25:28.930 --> 25:32.899
I'm serious.
What are we gonna do now?

25:34.901 --> 25:37.404
How the hell are we
supposed to get out of here?

25:37.904 --> 25:42.409
We don't have a stupid car anymore, and
there's not even one close enough to steal!

25:42.444 --> 25:45.412
You know,
i think about these things.

25:46.413 --> 25:48.415
Maybe nick was right.

25:48.450 --> 25:50.917
Maybe frank
ain't coming back.

25:50.952 --> 25:53.420
What the hell
are you looking for?

25:53.455 --> 25:58.425
Frank got us out here for
something. I'm gonna find out what.

25:58.460 --> 26:02.930
What the hell was a big-time operator like
you doing in a pissant little town like that?

26:02.965 --> 26:06.433
All they got out here is blue
skies and cow shit. Cow shit.

26:06.468 --> 26:09.436
You weren't thinking of going
into cattle rustling, were ya?

26:11.438 --> 26:13.941
Come on, frank.
Satisfy my curiosity.

26:13.976 --> 26:18.445
We can't charge you for something
youthought you were gonna do.

26:18.946 --> 26:21.949
He's mad at us, george. I
think we ruined his plans.

26:21.984 --> 26:23.951
Bill, he's only got himself to
blame. You're right there, george.

26:24.451 --> 26:28.455
We warned him the last time he hit one of
our banks in newark we were gonna get him.

26:28.490 --> 26:30.457
Well, frank, we got ya. Yeah.

26:30.492 --> 26:33.961
You belong to new jersey now. Just
a quick little plane ride away.

26:33.996 --> 26:36.463
Pull over at the next station.
I gotta leak my lizard.

26:36.498 --> 26:38.465
Okay, sure.
How'd you find me?

26:38.500 --> 26:42.970
Well, let me see, frank. How did
we find ya? You remember, bill?

26:43.005 --> 26:45.973
His stepmother told us.

26:47.975 --> 26:50.477
That's right.
Your stepmother told us.

26:50.512 --> 26:53.480
But don't get her wrong. She
wouldn't tell us right off.

26:53.515 --> 26:56.483
We had to beat it
out of her.

26:59.486 --> 27:02.489
Frank, we're just kidding.
We didn't touch her.

27:02.524 --> 27:06.493
No, we didn't lay a hand on
her. It cost us a hundred bucks!

27:06.528 --> 27:08.996
Your stepmom
drives a hard bargain!

27:09.031 --> 27:10.998
If it'll make you
feel any better,

27:11.033 --> 27:13.500
she wouldn't take anything
less than a hundred.

27:56.143 --> 27:58.462
Shit!

28:12.976 --> 28:14.478
No games now, frank.

28:14.978 --> 28:18.482
You try and get smart, you'll be pissin'
in your pants all the way back to newark.

28:25.489 --> 28:27.991
? red eyes, white whiskey?

28:28.026 --> 28:31.495
? and a blue, blue heart?

28:31.995 --> 28:34.498
? i'm so patriotic?

28:34.998 --> 28:38.502
- Where's your can?
- Uh, in the back.

28:38.537 --> 28:41.004
? cupid does better
next time?

28:41.039 --> 28:44.007
? he hits me
with that dart?

28:44.042 --> 28:47.511
Hold it.
? red eyes, white whiskey?

28:47.546 --> 28:49.996
? and a blue, blue heart?

28:51.815 --> 28:54.818
All right, you got two
minutes. Don't waste it.

28:56.805 --> 28:59.523
Hmm?

28:59.558 --> 29:01.024
You got two minutes.

29:01.525 --> 29:04.528
Don't waste 'em makin'
plans for a new life-

29:11.034 --> 29:12.035
drop it.

29:42.866 --> 29:44.868
George!

29:44.903 --> 29:48.371
Back here! Help!
We're back here!

29:48.406 --> 29:50.373
Aw, shit!

29:50.408 --> 29:52.375
Oww! Shit!

29:52.410 --> 29:56.379
Damn it! Ohh! He went out
the window! Ohh! Shit! Oww!

29:56.414 --> 30:00.033
Oww!
Oh, no!

30:02.419 --> 30:04.421
Sh- oww! Shit.

30:05.922 --> 30:08.425
Get outta the way!

30:08.925 --> 30:10.927
Aaaah!

30:46.263 --> 30:48.265
Yeah! Yeah!

30:52.804 --> 30:55.622
Where is he? He took off
down the river in a canoe.

30:55.657 --> 30:59.059
He stole one of my canoes? He's
got my gun! How far can he go?

30:59.094 --> 31:02.062
The river runs 60 miles and then
it dumps into the clark fork.

31:02.097 --> 31:04.564
I mean, if he wanted to he could
float all the way to the pacific ocean.

31:04.599 --> 31:07.067
Oh, no, no, no. We are
bringing in a chopper. No!

31:07.102 --> 31:09.069
- No?
- No one's gonna know about this.

31:09.104 --> 31:11.071
We're gonna get that son of a bitch,
be back on the road in half an hour.

31:11.106 --> 31:13.073
Is there a road
along the river?

31:13.108 --> 31:15.575
No, it's all private land. Mostly ranches.
But there's a bridge about five miles down.

31:15.610 --> 31:17.577
You can probably beat
him there. Shoot it off!

31:17.612 --> 31:21.081
No, i got a hacksaw
- we don't have enough time! Shoot!

31:53.648 --> 31:55.615
Ohh, shit!

32:27.814 --> 32:30.817
Did you see him? I don't
see him. No, i don't.

32:30.852 --> 32:32.819
Come on.

32:37.824 --> 32:40.327
He couldn't have
got here before us!

32:40.362 --> 32:42.829
You take right side,
i'll take left.

32:42.864 --> 32:46.333
We'll work our way upriver 'til we find him.
He's gonna wish he'd never pulled this stunt.

32:46.368 --> 32:48.335
Just get
the flashlight.

32:52.639 --> 32:56.142
Ohhhh, shit!

33:03.933 --> 33:06.436
Ohh! Aah!

33:12.942 --> 33:15.945
Ohhh!
Aah! God!

33:15.980 --> 33:18.698
Whoa- aah!

33:42.889 --> 33:44.391
Did you
catch him?

33:45.892 --> 33:48.895
No.
But i found the car.

33:49.396 --> 33:51.898
He dumped the car?
Yeah.

33:52.399 --> 33:56.202
He ran it off the road, rolled
it a couple times and hit a tree.

33:56.237 --> 34:00.206
I don't think he could get it
started again. He totaled my car?

34:00.241 --> 34:02.208
And my feet.
Did he live?

34:02.243 --> 34:06.746
- God, i hope not.
- He walked away with just some cuts.

34:06.781 --> 34:11.551
Found him in the middle of the highway
on his hands and knees, throwing up.

34:11.585 --> 34:15.554
Isn't it great to make
new friends? Who found him?

34:15.590 --> 34:18.058
Cops. The cops? The cops.

34:18.092 --> 34:21.061
He was arrested
for drunken driving.

34:21.096 --> 34:24.063
He'll be arraigned tomorrow
morning at 9:00 a.m.

34:24.099 --> 34:28.016
And i never want to walk again
for the rest of my entire life.

34:28.518 --> 34:32.021
This is great. Nothin'
like workin' with the best.

34:32.056 --> 34:35.007
Let me ask
a really stupid question.

34:35.043 --> 34:36.693
Did frank show up?

34:37.193 --> 34:38.661
No.

34:40.163 --> 34:43.166
But we know
what the job is.

34:44.016 --> 34:47.704
A bank.

34:47.739 --> 34:50.706
What are we gonna do, rob
it and then run away on foot?

34:50.742 --> 34:53.059
There's half a million
in there.

34:53.094 --> 34:56.012
Half a million dollars?
How do you know that?

34:59.516 --> 35:02.435
We'll get a car.
Then we'll get nick.

35:02.936 --> 35:06.940
I hope that was
an attempt at humor.

35:06.975 --> 35:10.443
I can't bust in the vault, neither
can you. Nick is the only one who can!

35:10.478 --> 35:12.445
Are you going along
with this?

35:12.480 --> 35:16.449
A hundred-and-twenty-five k would
clear up an awful lot of debts.

35:20.737 --> 35:23.239
You're both crazy.

35:23.274 --> 35:26.042
- What have you got to lose?
- My temper!

35:28.044 --> 35:30.046
George!

35:30.081 --> 35:33.550
George! Here it is!

35:33.585 --> 35:37.053
The canoe!
Here it is!

35:37.088 --> 35:39.055
Look for
footprints!

35:39.556 --> 35:42.842
He must've taken off
cross-country! Right. Right!

35:49.098 --> 35:52.051
Hey, here's some footprints.

35:52.086 --> 35:56.406
Hey, george, over here!
I found some prints!

35:56.906 --> 36:00.910
They go into the woods!
What do you wanna do?

36:00.945 --> 36:03.913
- Follow 'em!
- He's got your gun!

36:03.948 --> 36:08.918
- I ain't going after him by myself!
- I'm comin!

36:08.953 --> 36:12.505
Look for
a place that's shallow!

36:14.007 --> 36:16.009
Careful!

36:17.010 --> 36:20.513
Put your shoes in your coat!
Tie it up real tight!

36:21.014 --> 36:22.715
Real tight, george!

36:32.258 --> 36:34.394
Come on!

36:35.361 --> 36:37.430
Aah. Ohh!

36:42.702 --> 36:44.704
Be careful!

36:46.706 --> 36:48.708
Shit!
It's freezing!

36:48.743 --> 36:52.212
Hey! Go slow!
Don't rush it!

36:52.712 --> 36:55.715
Shut up!
You're not helping me!

36:58.218 --> 37:00.220
Aaah!
Damn it!

37:00.720 --> 37:03.723
- What?
- A sharp rock, okay?

37:05.225 --> 37:06.726
Asshole.

37:15.235 --> 37:18.238
George, don't drop
the flashlight!

37:18.738 --> 37:22.242
Oh, j-

37:22.277 --> 37:27.247
hey, bill! My clothes! In
the river! Get my clothes!

37:27.282 --> 37:28.748
Oh, christ!

37:30.250 --> 37:32.252
Son of a bitch!

37:32.752 --> 37:35.755
What moron loses his
clothes? In the fuckin' river!

37:35.790 --> 37:38.258
Get my fuckin'
clothes!

37:38.293 --> 37:41.261
Aah!
Son of a bitch!

37:41.296 --> 37:45.048
That moron! I don't believe
- can't you move any faster?

37:45.548 --> 37:48.551
Small town, so we're gonna need
a car that doesn't stick out.

37:49.052 --> 37:51.054
Something nobody's gonna
recognize right away.

37:51.554 --> 37:54.057
Buick, chevy. Light
color so i can paint it.

37:54.557 --> 37:57.060
I'd like an eight. We're
gonna need the speed.

37:57.560 --> 38:00.063
Sounds just like the one nick
wrecked. I know. Don't remind me.

38:00.563 --> 38:02.065
That car
was perfect.

38:02.565 --> 38:07.070
The only reason i'm going through with
this is so i can kick nick's ass...

38:07.570 --> 38:09.072
after we get the money.

38:09.572 --> 38:12.075
Then i'm gonna run over him
with the new car.

38:14.577 --> 38:17.080
It's good to have
a goal in life.

38:28.591 --> 38:31.094
I
- that's it. You got it? I got it. Hold on.

38:31.594 --> 38:33.596
Please be careful!
Oh, jesus!

38:33.631 --> 38:35.598
Get 'em, get 'em! Shit! Come on!

38:35.633 --> 38:38.601
God, we don't fish in newark!
Son of a bitch. Don't drop it!

38:38.636 --> 38:40.603
Come on!
You got it?

38:40.638 --> 38:43.606
I got it! I got it!
Hold on. Hold on.

38:43.641 --> 38:46.109
Okay!

38:46.144 --> 38:49.112
Oh, thank god. Thank god is
right. I wasn't going back in.

38:49.147 --> 38:51.114
It's so wet though.

38:52.115 --> 38:54.117
Oh, no.

38:54.152 --> 38:56.119
- Oh, no.
- What? What?

38:57.120 --> 39:00.123
- My pants. They're not here!
- What?

39:00.158 --> 39:03.626
My wallet, my keys,
my badge, everything!

39:03.661 --> 39:05.628
They're not fucking here!

39:05.663 --> 39:07.630
Shit!
Goddamn it!

39:07.665 --> 39:10.133
Shit!
We'll find 'em... maybe.

40:09.325 --> 40:12.328
Please let it be
a cadillac.

40:20.336 --> 40:22.338
My car broke down.

40:22.373 --> 40:24.340
I need a lift
into town.

40:24.375 --> 40:27.126
I'm not going the highway, but this
road'll take you halfway. That do?

40:27.627 --> 40:31.631
- Sure will.
- Hop in back. Don don't let nobody ride in the cab.

40:31.666 --> 40:34.634
Oh, yeah.

40:36.636 --> 40:39.138
In back.
Come on.

40:40.139 --> 40:42.141
Back!

40:42.176 --> 40:47.146
Oh, boy. The dog sits in the
front and we all go in the back.

41:00.660 --> 41:04.163
I don't know what i just
stepped in, but it's real soft.

41:04.198 --> 41:07.667
- Shit.
- Why don't we wait for a garbage truck?

41:07.702 --> 41:10.670
That way each one of us
can have his own can.

41:10.705 --> 41:14.674
It's better than footin' it, man.
It ain't better than breathing.

41:17.677 --> 41:19.679
Look out for the-

41:23.217 --> 41:26.185
a hundred and fifty dollars
i paid for those shoes.

41:26.220 --> 41:28.688
Ay-yii!

41:41.368 --> 41:44.371
I'm gonna kill
that son of a bitch!

41:44.872 --> 41:48.876
With what, george? He stole your
gun. Maybe you'll lend me yours.

41:48.911 --> 41:52.880
Oh, no, no. I think we oughta
call in some help. No way!

41:52.915 --> 41:54.882
No way? No way?

41:54.917 --> 41:56.884
Hey, look at me
a second, okay?

41:56.919 --> 42:01.889
Am i wearing a raccoon hat
with a tail? I'm not, am i?

42:01.924 --> 42:04.892
I'll tell you why. Because
i ain't davy crockett...

42:04.927 --> 42:06.894
and you,
you're not daniel boone!

42:06.929 --> 42:09.897
And this,
this is not new jersey!

42:09.932 --> 42:12.900
How's that gonna
make us look, huh?

42:12.935 --> 42:16.904
Big-city detectives can't even get a
prisoner out of a stinkin' redneck county!

42:16.939 --> 42:18.906
How's it gonna look if we can't
find him? We're gonna find him.

42:18.941 --> 42:21.408
We're gonna find him.
We're going to the car.

42:21.443 --> 42:23.911
I'm gonna change my clothes and we're
gonna find him. You wanna know why?

42:23.946 --> 42:28.415
- Yeah.
- Because he's from newark too!

42:39.726 --> 42:41.728
Shit.

42:45.732 --> 42:47.734
Aah.

42:59.246 --> 43:00.747
Oh-ohh- yaah!

43:18.765 --> 43:21.268
Oww. Oww. Oww.

43:51.048 --> 43:53.050
Car!
Where?

43:53.085 --> 43:55.052
Over there.
Stop the truck!

43:56.053 --> 43:58.555
Aaah!

43:59.556 --> 44:02.059
Ohhh.

44:46.103 --> 44:49.106
Hey, shh! Listen!

44:49.141 --> 44:51.608
Listen, listen.
Did you hear that?

44:52.609 --> 44:54.611
I don't hear anything.

44:54.646 --> 44:57.614
You know what it sounded like? What?

44:57.649 --> 45:02.119
Nah, nothin', it's
- it's the river. I'm goin' a little crazy.

45:04.206 --> 45:06.156
It's a car.
Yeah. Hey.

45:06.191 --> 45:09.159
Isn't that
where we parked?

45:09.194 --> 45:12.162
No. No!
Shit!

45:18.452 --> 45:21.638
- Shit!
- Did you guys hear something?

45:21.673 --> 45:24.641
No. What? I don't know. It sounded like-

45:24.676 --> 45:27.644
hey, who cares. As long
as we're not walking, man.

45:27.679 --> 45:31.148
First thing we need to do is
get rid of these jersey plates.

45:31.183 --> 45:33.150
Sh-
goddamn it!

45:33.185 --> 45:35.152
Son of a bitch!

45:35.187 --> 45:38.655
I'm gonna kill him!
Who are you gonna kill?

45:38.690 --> 45:41.658
Are you blind? Salazar! He did this!

45:41.693 --> 45:44.661
He doubled back! The son
of a bitch doubled back!

45:44.696 --> 45:48.665
He was probably watching us
for the last goddamn hour!

45:48.700 --> 45:51.668
I'm gonna kill him!
Damn it!

45:51.703 --> 45:54.671
Yaah!
That's fine. That's-

46:14.975 --> 46:17.244
oh, god,
those are my footprints.

46:20.063 --> 46:22.065
I'm going in a circle!

46:36.880 --> 46:38.882
Yaaah!

46:41.885 --> 46:43.887
Oh, god.

47:34.472 --> 47:36.439
Ohh! Aah! Jesus!

47:42.946 --> 47:44.948
Ohh! Aah! Ohh!

48:04.133 --> 48:08.137
Take me to the courthouse. I'll see
what it'll take to bail nick out.

48:08.172 --> 48:11.641
You two drop the clothes at the
cleaners and check out the bank.

48:25.071 --> 48:27.073
Thanks.

48:31.877 --> 48:34.880
Good luck, fellas.
Hope you catch your man.

48:34.915 --> 48:36.882
Thank you.
You're welcome.

48:36.917 --> 48:38.884
For everything.

48:44.890 --> 48:46.892
I can't go in.

48:47.893 --> 48:50.396
Why not?
I look stupid.

48:51.897 --> 48:54.400
Look, george,
the more time we waste,

48:54.435 --> 48:56.902
the more distance salazar
puts between us and him.

48:56.937 --> 48:59.905
- Now, we go in here
and we put out an a.p.b.,

49:00.406 --> 49:02.408
and i bet we'll catch him
in three, four hours tops.

49:02.443 --> 49:05.344
- Huh.
- Come on.

49:05.379 --> 49:08.197
This is no time
to be self-conscious.

49:09.198 --> 49:12.201
Come on.
You don't look too bad.

49:12.236 --> 49:14.203
Well, here.

49:15.704 --> 49:17.706
Whew.

49:22.211 --> 49:24.213
I'm telling you, george,
we're gonna find our car...

49:24.713 --> 49:27.716
and we're gonna get your
clothes back; i promise.

49:34.223 --> 49:36.725
Then he doubled back
and stole our car.

49:36.760 --> 49:41.230
And we need the a.p.b. On
the white chrysler, jyt147.

49:41.265 --> 49:43.232
And he's armed.

49:45.234 --> 49:47.236
He- he got a.38.

49:47.271 --> 49:50.739
- Where did he get a.38?
- He got mine, all right? After he hit me!

49:50.774 --> 49:55.244
Come on, can't we move on this? The more
time we waste, the farther he gets away.

49:55.279 --> 49:59.248
Come on.
Do us a favor.

50:00.249 --> 50:03.752
All right. Send it out.
Frank salazar, description.

50:03.787 --> 50:07.256
Stolen vehicle,
jyt147.

50:07.756 --> 50:09.758
And don't forget to add...

50:09.793 --> 50:12.761
armed... and dangerous.

50:33.082 --> 50:35.084
How do.
Thanks.

50:35.119 --> 50:38.087
I'm gonna need
some change.

50:38.122 --> 50:40.089
Singles, please.

50:40.124 --> 50:42.091
Sure.

50:46.595 --> 50:49.381
Wanda.
That's a pretty name.

50:49.882 --> 50:51.383
Thank you.

50:51.418 --> 50:53.385
Could you, uh,
please change this for me?

50:53.420 --> 50:55.387
Sure.
Thanks a lot.

50:55.422 --> 50:57.389
Uh-

50:57.424 --> 51:00.392
ten and ten ones okay?
Yes.

51:00.427 --> 51:03.395
That's 10, 11, 12, 13,

51:03.430 --> 51:05.981
14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19...

51:06.016 --> 51:07.983
and 20.
There you go.

51:08.484 --> 51:10.486
Thank you.

51:10.521 --> 51:12.988
- That's a really pretty dress.
- Thank you.

51:13.023 --> 51:16.492
I got it here in town. Uh,
you're not from here, are you?

51:16.527 --> 51:18.494
Ahem.

51:18.994 --> 51:20.996
Um, no.

51:21.031 --> 51:23.499
Uh, come back again.

51:23.534 --> 51:25.000
Hmm.

51:30.506 --> 51:34.009
State of
montana vs. Nick bartkowski.

51:34.044 --> 51:36.011
Please stand.

51:36.046 --> 51:40.015
Mr. Bartkowski?

51:40.050 --> 51:44.019
We don't usually get people with
as much experience as you have.

51:44.054 --> 51:47.523
This is quite a repertoire. Are you
looking to broaden your horizons?

51:47.558 --> 51:52.027
Uh, no, your honor. I just
got a little drunk. That's all.

51:52.062 --> 51:55.331
And stole a car. Let's not
leave that out, shall we?

51:55.366 --> 51:58.217
L- i didn't steal
that car.

51:58.252 --> 52:00.619
That car is a stolen vehicle,
mr. Bartkowski.

52:00.654 --> 52:04.290
If you didn't steal it,
who did?

52:04.325 --> 52:06.592
- Frank salazar.
Frank salazar?

52:06.627 --> 52:09.094
Yeah, i just borrowed it
from him, uh, yesterday.

52:09.595 --> 52:11.096
Uh, deputy?

52:16.904 --> 52:18.637
Thank you.

52:21.140 --> 52:23.642
Are you sure
it was yesterday...

52:23.677 --> 52:26.545
that you borrowed the car
from frank salazar?

52:28.147 --> 52:30.649
Well, maybe it was
the day before yesterday.

52:30.684 --> 52:33.152
But you're sure
it was frank salazar?

52:33.187 --> 52:35.521
Pretty sure.

52:35.556 --> 52:38.958
Are you saying now that
you're not sure it was...

52:38.993 --> 52:41.527
frank salazar
that loaned you the car?

52:41.927 --> 52:45.798
It was dark, and, um, the man
said his name was frank salazar.

52:46.298 --> 52:48.584
But i don't really know
frank salazar, so-

52:48.619 --> 52:51.587
you expect me to believe that
a man you don't even know...

52:51.622 --> 52:53.589
loans you a car
in a dark place?

52:56.592 --> 53:00.596
Well, it was, uh, uh,
a friend of a friend.

53:00.631 --> 53:03.098
Mr. Bartkowski?

53:05.636 --> 53:10.105
I guess you didn't know that mr.
Salazar was a guest in our jail...

53:10.140 --> 53:12.107
until yesterday morning.

53:14.610 --> 53:17.112
No, i didn't know that.

53:17.147 --> 53:19.615
He was then released into the
custody of two detectives...

53:19.650 --> 53:21.617
who are escorting him
back to new jersey.

53:21.652 --> 53:24.119
Now, i'm almost sure...

53:24.154 --> 53:26.622
that they wouldn't have
let him lend you a stolen car.

53:26.657 --> 53:29.625
Hmm?

53:29.660 --> 53:33.178
So assuming there isn't more than
one frank salazar in our town,

53:33.213 --> 53:35.180
i set bail at $5,000.

53:37.182 --> 53:40.185
Five thousand? If you
can't afford an attorney,

53:40.686 --> 53:42.688
one will be supplied
to you.

53:42.723 --> 53:45.190
Five grand bail.

53:45.225 --> 53:47.693
For a d.u.i.?

53:47.728 --> 53:50.696
And for a grand theft
on the car.

53:51.196 --> 53:53.198
Frank must've stolen it. He
was in jail yesterday morning.

53:53.699 --> 53:56.201
Salazar was in jail? He was.

53:56.236 --> 54:00.205
A couple of cops picked him up and now
he's being taken back to new jersey.

54:00.706 --> 54:02.207
You don't think he'd talk,
do you?

54:02.708 --> 54:05.210
Frank? Never.

54:05.711 --> 54:08.714
Uh, well- just- you said they
were taking him back to jersey?

54:08.749 --> 54:10.716
That's what the judge said.

54:12.217 --> 54:14.219
This car had jersey plates.

54:27.733 --> 54:30.235
If it is their car,
where are they?

54:30.270 --> 54:32.237
And where's frank?

54:32.272 --> 54:36.742
And what the hell were they doing
on that dirt road down by the river?

54:38.243 --> 54:39.745
Maybe it's not
their car.

54:42.783 --> 54:45.250
So what are we
gonna do?

54:45.285 --> 54:48.754
We're gonna do just like take
the bank. Only we do it tonight.

54:48.789 --> 54:51.256
Tonight?
We're not ready.

54:51.291 --> 54:53.258
We'll get ready.
What about nick?

54:53.293 --> 54:55.761
- We bail him out.
- With what?

54:55.796 --> 54:59.264
With my good looks?
Where you gonna get $5,000?

55:00.766 --> 55:03.268
I got 400 bucks.
How much you got?

55:04.269 --> 55:07.773
Not enough.
How much?

55:07.808 --> 55:09.775
About 300.

55:09.810 --> 55:13.278
You? Why don't you just
kick me in the nuts?

55:13.779 --> 55:17.282
Aren't you proud
to live in a democracy?

55:17.317 --> 55:20.285
Seven or eight
hundred dollars.

55:20.320 --> 55:22.788
Then all we need
is another 3,500.

55:27.827 --> 55:29.712
My guess is he's headed north.

55:29.747 --> 55:33.215
He can catch the interstate in missoula, get
into washington, or keep going into canada.

55:33.250 --> 55:35.217
Anyway, at this point,
it's just a waitin' game.

55:35.718 --> 55:37.720
We'll get him. You boys look
like you could use some rest.

55:38.220 --> 55:40.723
You want me to drop you
at the motel?

55:40.758 --> 55:43.225
When can we catch a plane? Anytime.

55:43.260 --> 55:45.728
I can have the deputy
run you up to missoula.

55:45.763 --> 55:48.230
We have a robbery
at the shop 'n go on 93.

55:48.265 --> 55:51.734
Male,
about five-ten, 140 pounds,

55:51.769 --> 55:55.738
wearin' a nylon stocking over his
head; got into a white car. Salazar.

55:58.240 --> 56:01.744
Twenty-six hundred.
Not enough.

56:02.244 --> 56:04.246
We need another 900.

56:04.281 --> 56:06.248
Why don't we just
take out a loan?

56:07.249 --> 56:09.251
We can hit one more.

56:09.752 --> 56:12.254
Are you out of your mind?
We're gonna get nailed!

56:12.289 --> 56:15.758
This isn't miami, you know. Every cop
they have'll be swarming over that market.

56:15.793 --> 56:18.260
- If we hit another right now, they won't be ready.
- Theywon't be ready?

56:18.761 --> 56:21.263
I'm not ready! I haven't
done this since i was 17!

56:21.298 --> 56:23.265
Look at the bright side.

56:23.300 --> 56:26.769
If we get caught, they'll probably
put us in the same cell as nick.

56:29.271 --> 56:30.773
Go.

56:32.274 --> 56:34.276
I can't believe
i'm doing this.

56:34.311 --> 56:37.279
Give me a hand
over here.

56:37.314 --> 56:40.783
And then he made me lie face down
on the floor so i couldn't see him.

56:40.818 --> 56:43.786
Then he took the money from the
register. Did he have a scar?

56:43.821 --> 56:45.788
A scar?

56:45.823 --> 56:49.792
Did he have a scar right here?
You know what a scar is? Over here?

56:49.827 --> 56:52.795
- Listen, gina, just relax.
Take your time.

56:53.295 --> 56:56.298
Do you remember
if the man had a scar?

56:56.799 --> 56:58.801
Huh? Huh?

56:59.802 --> 57:03.305
I think so.

57:03.340 --> 57:05.307
- I knew it!
- See?

57:05.342 --> 57:08.310
Sheriff, we got another robbery in
progress. White chrysler, on main street.

57:08.811 --> 57:10.813
Let's go! Block off this end of town.

57:21.323 --> 57:23.826
Go, go, go, go, go!

57:31.834 --> 57:34.336
Oh, shit!

57:44.847 --> 57:48.350
White car!
Took off down third street!

57:57.860 --> 58:00.863
360, 361,

58:00.898 --> 58:04.366
62, 63, 64, 65.

58:04.867 --> 58:08.871
Do you have to count out loud?
I'd like this not to be so obvious.

58:08.906 --> 58:12.875
I'm sorry. I'll try to be more discrete.

58:17.379 --> 58:21.884
66, 67, 68, 69.

59:01.373 --> 59:03.375
Chris, this is henault.

59:03.410 --> 59:05.377
Anything happen up
your end of town?

59:05.412 --> 59:08.380
It's quiet as a foam rubber
wind chime down here.

59:08.415 --> 59:11.884
Stay awake. We're headed in that
direction. I think we got him boxed in.

59:11.919 --> 59:13.886
Ten-four.

59:34.957 --> 59:36.959
- There! - bingo.
- We got him!

59:36.994 --> 59:38.961
What are you gonna do?
Shut up!

59:53.510 --> 59:56.478
Go get set in back
of the others.

59:56.513 --> 59:58.480
Right.

59:58.981 --> 01:00:00.983
Frank salazar,
we know you're in there.

01:00:01.483 --> 01:00:06.488
Throw out your weapons and come out
with your hands on top of your head.

01:00:08.991 --> 01:00:11.493
You're completely
surrounded, frank.

01:00:24.006 --> 01:00:26.008
Frank, this is your last chance.

01:00:26.043 --> 01:00:29.027
We're tired of
playing games with you.

01:00:29.062 --> 01:00:32.231
You either come out now,
or we're coming in after you.

01:00:32.266 --> 01:00:34.049
You got one minute.

01:00:38.036 --> 01:00:42.441
I got explosives, but you gotta give me
a hole through both layers of this door.

01:00:42.476 --> 01:00:45.694
And i thought you guys bailed
me out because you missed me.

01:00:45.729 --> 01:00:50.199
Oh, we did. Without your wit and charm,
there would've been a real hole in our lives.

01:00:50.234 --> 01:00:54.203
Too bad you didn't
fall in it.

01:00:54.238 --> 01:00:58.207
Gentlemen!
We're here to do a job.

01:00:58.242 --> 01:01:00.709
If you have it in mind to bump one another
off, i wish you'd have the courtesy...

01:01:00.744 --> 01:01:02.711
to wait 'til after
the job is done.

01:01:02.746 --> 01:01:07.216
Otherwise we'd have gone through all this
for nothing; that would really piss me off!

01:01:07.251 --> 01:01:09.718
In fact, i'd probably be so upset i'd
kill whichever one of you was still alive.

01:01:09.753 --> 01:01:13.222
Cut the bullshit and get on with
it. We got a lot of work to do.

01:01:13.257 --> 01:01:15.724
You want me to do a job? I'll do a job.

01:01:16.225 --> 01:01:20.012
But i can do it without
the threats, okay?

01:01:23.515 --> 01:01:26.518
Don't forget who
you're talking to.

01:01:26.553 --> 01:01:30.522
If it hadn't been for us, you'd still be in
the can looking at ten years for grand theft!

01:01:30.557 --> 01:01:35.027
We went through a lot of trouble
because of you! You owe us!

01:01:36.461 --> 01:01:38.830
- What's wrong with him?
- Max?

01:01:41.333 --> 01:01:43.335
Max, are you all right?
What's going on?

01:01:43.370 --> 01:01:46.338
Carlos, give me a chair!
Sit down.

01:01:46.373 --> 01:01:48.840
We oughta give him
some water or something.

01:01:48.875 --> 01:01:51.843
Get the water!

01:01:51.878 --> 01:01:54.346
Maybe you oughta
lie down.

01:01:54.846 --> 01:01:56.848
I'm all right. All right? Are you kidding?

01:01:57.349 --> 01:01:58.850
You should see yourself.

01:02:03.138 --> 01:02:05.140
I said i'm all right.

01:02:12.948 --> 01:02:16.952
If you're worried
about me dying, don't.

01:02:16.987 --> 01:02:20.455
I'll have at least the courtesy
to wait 'til after the job.

01:02:22.958 --> 01:02:25.961
The alarm's
a standard model 1400.

01:02:25.996 --> 01:02:29.214
There are no floor
contact mats or eyes.

01:02:29.715 --> 01:02:33.719
I can, uh, put it to sleep
in about 30 minutes.

01:02:33.754 --> 01:02:35.621
How long for the safe?

01:02:42.894 --> 01:02:44.896
These pictures
aren't any good.

01:02:44.931 --> 01:02:50.152
But it looks like a wertheim, about ten
years old. That would give it a ul2 rating.

01:02:50.187 --> 01:02:53.155
If that's what it is, i can cut
into it in about two hours.

01:02:53.190 --> 01:02:55.657
If it's a newer safe,
we're gonna have to blow it.

01:02:55.692 --> 01:02:58.610
It's gonna take a lot longer, and then i
don't even know if i can get into the bitch.

01:02:59.011 --> 01:03:03.081
I'm not gonna know anything 'til i get
inside and take a look at the dials.

01:03:03.116 --> 01:03:07.586
- What about getting inside?
- The place next door is a real estate office.

01:03:07.621 --> 01:03:11.590
We pick the lock; we get in;
we go through the wall.

01:03:11.625 --> 01:03:13.875
It's made of brick,
like your brain.

01:03:14.376 --> 01:03:16.862
It's one-foot thick,
two layers.

01:03:16.897 --> 01:03:19.348
Time in and out, about four-and-a-half
hours. That puts us out about 6:30.

01:03:19.383 --> 01:03:21.350
Sunrise is 7:00.

01:03:21.385 --> 01:03:23.352
What about cops?
We don't have much time.

01:03:23.387 --> 01:03:26.855
There's only one road in and out of this
town. They can box us in pretty easy.

01:03:26.890 --> 01:03:29.358
They could if their cars
were running.

01:03:30.642 --> 01:03:33.645
They only got eight cars.
What if we took 'em out?

01:03:34.146 --> 01:03:36.148
Couldn't do it in chicago,
miami or new york,

01:03:36.648 --> 01:03:39.251
but with only eight cars, we could
take out the entire police force.

01:03:39.651 --> 01:03:41.520
Knock 'em out,
make it so they can't run.

01:03:41.555 --> 01:03:44.523
How? You can take out a
car with just a firecracker.

01:03:44.558 --> 01:03:47.075
You just pull
the distributor cap off.

01:03:47.110 --> 01:03:50.078
Doesn't take much when
it's put in the right place.

01:03:50.113 --> 01:03:52.080
You can do it?
Yeah.

01:03:52.115 --> 01:03:55.083
A little help from carlos
and the 'works, i'm happenin'.

01:03:57.085 --> 01:04:00.088
I can't guarantee the size
of the explosions, but...

01:04:00.123 --> 01:04:02.074
i can make what you need.

01:04:02.474 --> 01:04:05.894
Carlos, i'm gonna want
another car.

01:04:05.929 --> 01:04:08.897
I want to drive away
from this clean.

01:04:10.399 --> 01:04:13.902
When are we planning on
doing this?

01:04:13.937 --> 01:04:16.905
- Tonight.
- Tonight?

01:04:16.940 --> 01:04:19.257
You got to be kidding.

01:04:19.292 --> 01:04:23.095
We gotta wait 'til the bar across
the street closes. That's at 2:00.

01:04:23.130 --> 01:04:24.863
We got eight hours.

01:06:45.587 --> 01:06:48.590
Police broke down the front door
of mrs. Clare brown's house...

01:06:48.625 --> 01:06:50.592
and discovered that salazar
had already fled the scene.

01:06:50.627 --> 01:06:53.595
Channel 13 news has learned
that he had escaped earlier...

01:06:53.630 --> 01:06:55.597
from two new jersey
detectives:

01:06:55.632 --> 01:06:57.599
George denver
and bill lonigan.

01:06:57.634 --> 01:07:02.104
They refused to be interviewed for this
broadcast, but we did speak to a mr. Dana settler,

01:07:02.139 --> 01:07:05.607
local agricultural specialist who had
helped the detectives earlier in the day.

01:07:05.642 --> 01:07:09.111
Well, sir, when we first saw
these two fellas from new jersey,

01:07:09.146 --> 01:07:11.613
uh, one of 'em,
uh, uh- ge-

01:07:11.648 --> 01:07:13.615
george.
George, it was.

01:07:13.650 --> 01:07:17.119
He wasn't wearing any pants.
I'm shuttin' the damn thing off.

01:07:17.619 --> 01:07:21.123
- Come on, get rid of the bottle and get dressed.
- What's the point, george?

01:07:21.158 --> 01:07:23.125
We look like morons.

01:07:23.625 --> 01:07:25.627
Anybody who saw the news isn't
gonna help us. You know why?

01:07:26.128 --> 01:07:28.630
I'll tell ya. 'cause they don't
want to look like morons too.

01:07:28.665 --> 01:07:33.135
So you're just gonna give up, huh?
It gets a little hot in the kitchen.

01:07:33.170 --> 01:07:36.138
A little hot, george?
A little hot?

01:07:36.173 --> 01:07:38.640
The fucking kitchen
burned down, george!

01:07:38.675 --> 01:07:41.143
All right, it's shitty. Is
that what you want me to say?

01:07:41.178 --> 01:07:44.146
It's a big, stinkin',
shitty, snot-nosed situation.

01:07:44.181 --> 01:07:46.148
I'm not happy about it.

01:07:46.183 --> 01:07:48.150
But it's what it is,
and it's all there is.

01:07:48.650 --> 01:07:51.653
If you expect me to stick my gun up
my ass and pull the trigger, forget it.

01:07:51.688 --> 01:07:54.156
You go drink yourself to death
if you think that will help.

01:07:54.656 --> 01:07:57.159
I'm goin' after him. I'm
gonna find the son of a bitch.

01:07:57.194 --> 01:08:00.162
I'm gonna stick my gun
up his ass and pull the trigger.

01:08:09.671 --> 01:08:11.673
How do we start?

01:08:11.708 --> 01:08:13.675
Yeah, um,

01:08:14.176 --> 01:08:17.179
i got a 1976 oldsmobile station
wagon, blue vista cruiser,

01:08:17.214 --> 01:08:21.683
license 130495z, montana;
reported stolen at 3:30.

01:08:21.718 --> 01:08:23.685
Thanks.
Yeah.

01:09:22.243 --> 01:09:24.246
Okay.

01:10:03.785 --> 01:10:06.288
Okay, you got one car on the
left, two cars on the right.

01:11:12.354 --> 01:11:14.356
Car! Car!

01:11:47.689 --> 01:11:50.192
Shit.

01:12:00.202 --> 01:12:03.205
It's the wrong color, george.
We're looking for a blue one.

01:12:04.706 --> 01:12:06.708
Yeah, yeah.

01:12:18.503 --> 01:12:21.006
Right year, right make.

01:12:21.041 --> 01:12:24.009
Wrong color, wrong number.
Damn!

01:12:24.044 --> 01:12:26.011
Let's go, george.
Come on.

01:12:26.046 --> 01:12:28.513
I doubt he'd park it in front
of the police station.

01:12:32.017 --> 01:12:34.019
Come on!

01:12:41.026 --> 01:12:44.029
You know, he may be a bozo, but
he's not that much of a bozo.

01:13:20.365 --> 01:13:22.367
Okay. Ready.

01:13:26.872 --> 01:13:29.875
Oh! Look out!
Look out! Whoa!

01:13:39.917 --> 01:13:41.919
Do me one more favor.

01:13:41.954 --> 01:13:44.422
Check a license for me.
Montana.

01:13:44.457 --> 01:13:47.925
13-dash-zero-224z.

01:13:47.960 --> 01:13:50.928
Is this another stolen
vista cruiser?

01:13:50.963 --> 01:13:53.431
Maybe.

01:13:53.931 --> 01:13:56.434
Okay.

01:13:56.469 --> 01:14:00.938
Zero-224z.

01:14:05.643 --> 01:14:08.028
No. No stolen
vista cruiser this time.

01:14:08.063 --> 01:14:10.531
What's it belong to?
It's a '79 suburban.

01:14:10.566 --> 01:14:14.552
You sure? Yeah, unless i've gone blind.

01:14:14.587 --> 01:14:17.421
Holy jesus!

01:14:17.922 --> 01:14:22.426
- What?
- Your sleeve has white paint on it.

01:14:22.461 --> 01:14:24.929
You leaned
on the cruiser.

01:14:25.429 --> 01:14:27.431
He painted the car,
george!

01:14:27.466 --> 01:14:30.434
Come on!
Oof!

01:15:28.242 --> 01:15:30.744
Max. Max!

01:15:30.779 --> 01:15:33.747
The vault's newer
than i thought.

01:15:34.248 --> 01:15:37.751
Yeah. So? So it's gonna take
at least a half hour longer.

01:15:38.252 --> 01:15:40.754
Then it'll be light
before we finish.

01:15:40.789 --> 01:15:44.258
Right. And all your little bombs
are gonna go off at the wrong time.

01:15:44.293 --> 01:15:46.260
Shit!

01:15:46.295 --> 01:15:49.763
Look, if we're gonna quit,
we better quit right now.

01:15:49.798 --> 01:15:53.767
Maybe- maybe
i can cut my time.

01:15:53.802 --> 01:15:55.769
Maybe? I can't deal
with maybes.

01:15:55.804 --> 01:15:58.272
Either you can
or you can't.

01:16:03.277 --> 01:16:05.279
I can.

01:16:09.283 --> 01:16:12.286
Well, then,
let's rob a bank.

01:16:12.786 --> 01:16:14.288
It's almost 4:00.
I can see.

01:16:14.788 --> 01:16:16.790
We got a half an hour more,
and three more cars.

01:16:17.291 --> 01:16:21.295
What if we don't find 'em? Well, then
nothing else better botch, you know?

01:16:21.330 --> 01:16:24.798
Number six!
Ohh!

01:16:44.818 --> 01:16:46.820
Nick!

01:16:52.142 --> 01:16:55.162
We're gonna be late, man.
- Let's forget the last two.

01:16:55.197 --> 01:16:57.164
No. No, no, no.
We don't have time.

01:16:57.199 --> 01:17:01.168
They still have two cars. They can
box us in, man. I'd rather be late.

01:17:01.203 --> 01:17:04.672
What if they're done early? They're not
gonna want to sit on that money for too long.

01:17:04.707 --> 01:17:08.175
All right, pull a u-ie.
Holy shit!

01:17:08.210 --> 01:17:12.179
Number seven just pulled up next
to us. All right, uh, listen, man.

01:17:12.214 --> 01:17:15.683
Distract 'em, ask 'em directions,
anything. Just keep 'em talking.

01:17:15.718 --> 01:17:17.601
Are you crazy?
Shh!

01:17:17.636 --> 01:17:20.471
- Don't do this to me.
- Rock 'n' roll.

01:17:26.277 --> 01:17:27.778
Howdy.

01:17:29.280 --> 01:17:32.283
I'm- i'm kinda lost.

01:17:32.318 --> 01:17:34.785
What are you looking for?
Um-

01:17:34.820 --> 01:17:36.787
a friend of mine,
uh-

01:17:36.822 --> 01:17:40.291
she told me to, uh, to get
to main street, you know,

01:17:40.326 --> 01:17:43.794
and go all the way up,
up until the end of the street.

01:17:44.295 --> 01:17:47.298
And then make a right.

01:17:47.333 --> 01:17:50.084
And, uh, the street just
kept going on and on and on.

01:17:50.119 --> 01:17:52.086
What's your friend's name?

01:17:53.587 --> 01:17:55.589
Her name?

01:17:55.624 --> 01:17:58.592
Um-
um-

01:17:58.627 --> 01:18:01.095
um-
aah!

01:18:02.096 --> 01:18:05.099
Wanda. Wanda.
That's it.

01:18:05.134 --> 01:18:08.102
She works at the, uh,
at the bank.

01:18:08.602 --> 01:18:11.105
- Wanda brem?
- Wanda brem, yeah.

01:18:11.140 --> 01:18:13.107
Wanda brem.

01:18:15.109 --> 01:18:17.111
She invited you over
to her house?

01:18:17.146 --> 01:18:19.613
Yeah, yeah.

01:18:19.648 --> 01:18:22.116
What for?
What for?

01:18:22.151 --> 01:18:26.120
Uh-huh. Um, to have
something to eat, you know.

01:18:26.155 --> 01:18:29.123
We're gonna eat some food.

01:18:32.661 --> 01:18:36.630
Uh, you want to go up main st.,
take a right on third.

01:18:36.665 --> 01:18:40.134
Two blocks,
second house on your right.

01:18:40.169 --> 01:18:42.136
Okay.
Thank you much.

01:18:45.139 --> 01:18:47.641
Thanks a lot.

01:19:43.197 --> 01:19:45.699
- Did you get all the cars?
- We got seven out of eight.

01:19:45.734 --> 01:19:47.701
Shit.

01:20:02.216 --> 01:20:04.218
Cool it.

01:20:16.730 --> 01:20:19.233
Salazar painted that car
for a reason!

01:20:19.268 --> 01:20:22.236
You think he's gonna
pull a job in this town?

01:20:22.271 --> 01:20:25.239
I don't think he came here
for the fishing.

01:20:32.246 --> 01:20:33.747
There's only one bank,
george.

01:20:36.250 --> 01:20:38.252
Yes, there is.

01:21:26.300 --> 01:21:29.803
You may need this.

01:21:52.276 --> 01:21:54.578
We've got him!

01:22:33.651 --> 01:22:36.154
What the hell is goin' on?

01:22:58.176 --> 01:23:03.014
This is it! We got him! We got salazar!

01:23:03.049 --> 01:23:05.516
You stay, watch the car.
I'll go get the sheriff.

01:23:05.551 --> 01:23:07.518
- We'll catch this slimeball
red-handed. - Right.

01:23:08.019 --> 01:23:09.520
Right, right.

01:25:01.515 --> 01:25:03.517
Don't move, frank!

01:25:06.020 --> 01:25:08.522
Don't be stupid.

01:25:08.557 --> 01:25:11.525
Put down the gun...

01:25:11.560 --> 01:25:13.527
and turn around
real slow.

01:25:26.540 --> 01:25:29.043
Let's get him inside.
Let's get him off me.

01:25:37.551 --> 01:25:40.554
This guy never missed
a dinner in his life.

01:25:43.724 --> 01:25:45.726
Just fold him.

01:25:45.761 --> 01:25:48.229
Have you ever seen
this guy before?

01:25:48.264 --> 01:25:50.731
I seen a lot
of him tonight.

01:25:50.766 --> 01:25:52.733
Hey! Blow it!
We gotta go now.

01:26:04.795 --> 01:26:07.615
No, bill is watching the
car! No, meet me there!

01:26:07.650 --> 01:26:10.117
Sheriff, i promise you
this is it!

01:26:10.152 --> 01:26:12.119
How long would it take?
Two minutes?

01:26:12.154 --> 01:26:14.121
Yeah. Wait.

01:26:14.156 --> 01:26:16.123
Yes, sir.

01:26:16.158 --> 01:26:18.626
Right. Okay, okay.
All right. Right.

01:26:18.661 --> 01:26:21.128
Right, right. Yeah.
I'll get the dispatch.

01:26:46.654 --> 01:26:48.656
This happens.
It happens.

01:27:04.672 --> 01:27:06.674
Aha! Aha!

01:27:06.709 --> 01:27:10.177
That's why they pay me
the big bucks! Oh, yeah.

01:27:20.938 --> 01:27:23.941
I need all available units over at
citizens state bank. Burglary in progress.

01:27:23.976 --> 01:27:25.943
Let's go. Come on.
All cars, all cars:

01:27:25.978 --> 01:27:28.946
Proceed to citizens state bank.
Bank burglary in progress.

01:27:28.981 --> 01:27:31.949
Surround the building.
Proceed to citizens state bank.

01:27:32.449 --> 01:27:34.952
Burglary in progress.
Surround the building.

01:28:02.279 --> 01:28:04.782
You okay, max?
Now!

01:28:16.293 --> 01:28:18.796
Ow! Holy-
shoot!

01:28:44.321 --> 01:28:46.323
Son of a bitch!

01:29:06.377 --> 01:29:08.879
Let's go!

01:29:16.086 --> 01:29:18.355
No!

01:29:25.362 --> 01:29:26.864
Aah!

01:29:29.867 --> 01:29:31.869
Bill!

01:29:32.870 --> 01:29:34.872
Bill!

01:29:37.374 --> 01:29:39.376
Bill!
George!

01:29:40.878 --> 01:29:42.379
What happened?
I got hit.

01:29:42.880 --> 01:29:45.382
Salazar?
Aw, who the hell knows?

01:29:47.419 --> 01:29:50.387
Salazar just hit the bank. If
we don't hurry, we lose him.

01:29:54.391 --> 01:29:56.393
Damn it!
What?

01:29:56.428 --> 01:29:59.897
I should've been in that safe in
20 minutes. Not 30, not 40, not 50.

01:30:00.397 --> 01:30:02.900
Twenty minutes.
You did a good job.

01:30:02.935 --> 01:30:05.402
We did it. We pulled it
off. We're out of there.

01:30:05.437 --> 01:30:07.404
What do you want,
confetti?

01:30:07.439 --> 01:30:09.907
No. For once, i would
just like perfection.

01:30:09.942 --> 01:30:11.909
That's all. Just
perfection. Lighten up, man.

01:30:11.944 --> 01:30:13.911
You're no fun.
You are no fun.

01:30:13.946 --> 01:30:16.413
Nick, i hate to admit it,

01:30:16.914 --> 01:30:18.415
but you're okay.

01:30:18.916 --> 01:30:22.419
- Aw, you're just saying that.
- Woo-o-o-o-o.

01:30:22.454 --> 01:30:24.922
Ohh.

01:30:29.426 --> 01:30:31.428
Carlos, i think i just
found number eight.

01:30:40.938 --> 01:30:43.941
Lt. Horn, this is sheriff
henault. We got 'em in sight.

01:30:43.976 --> 01:30:47.444
We're comin' into the valley in the
southern end about five miles north of darby.

01:30:47.479 --> 01:30:49.947
We're about ten minutes
behind you, sheriff.

01:30:53.951 --> 01:30:56.453
They turned.
Goddamn it! How?

01:30:56.488 --> 01:30:58.956
Maybe the fat guy
you hit over the head.

01:30:58.991 --> 01:31:01.959
We gotta get off the road and kill the
dust. We're leaving a trail a mile long.

01:31:01.994 --> 01:31:05.462
Here, go through this pasture here.
We can get to the house from there.

01:31:05.963 --> 01:31:08.966
This road is bullshit. It
dead ends a couple of miles up.

01:31:09.466 --> 01:31:11.969
It'll give us some time.
Trust me!

01:31:13.470 --> 01:31:16.974
I can't see through this dust!
I can't see 'em!

01:31:17.474 --> 01:31:18.976
Move it! Move it!

01:31:29.987 --> 01:31:31.989
Carlos, watch the road.

01:31:32.990 --> 01:31:34.992
We'll get the gear,
split the money later.

01:31:38.495 --> 01:31:41.498
Get the car running.
Got it.

01:32:22.456 --> 01:32:24.458
Shit! We lost 'em!

01:32:24.493 --> 01:32:26.960
Back the goddamn thing up!
What are you doing?

01:32:26.995 --> 01:32:28.962
I am backin' up.
We didn't lose 'em.

01:32:29.463 --> 01:32:30.964
What, are you blind?
Shut up.

01:32:34.968 --> 01:32:37.971
- See anything?
- Nothing. Let's get the hell out of here.

01:33:13.957 --> 01:33:17.461
Carlos? Ray!

01:33:23.767 --> 01:33:25.852
Oh. Max?

01:33:25.887 --> 01:33:28.855
Carlos! Ray?

01:33:29.356 --> 01:33:31.858
Nick? I made it.

01:33:34.361 --> 01:33:36.363
I made it.

01:33:36.863 --> 01:33:39.866
Oh, i made it.
I made it. Ohh!

01:34:01.471 --> 01:34:03.473
Max?

01:34:14.935 --> 01:34:16.553
Oh, i made it.

01:34:20.157 --> 01:34:23.443
We got him!
We got him!

01:34:23.944 --> 01:34:25.445
You son of a bitch.

01:34:27.999 --> 01:34:31.251
Frank salazar, this is the law.

01:34:31.286 --> 01:34:32.752
The house is surrounded.

01:34:33.236 --> 01:34:37.674
Throw down your weapons and come out
with your hands on top of your head.

01:35:02.032 --> 01:35:04.401
Salazar.

01:35:09.990 --> 01:35:12.492
I've never been this fucked
up by a little piece of-

01:35:12.993 --> 01:35:14.494
thirty-two.

01:35:17.998 --> 01:35:21.501
I knew it! I knew it!
God, what's going on?

01:35:21.536 --> 01:35:26.006
It's not my fault.
When's it gonna be fixed?

01:35:26.041 --> 01:35:30.010
Never! It's a face
plant, man. It's history.

01:35:30.045 --> 01:35:31.895
We're stuck here?

01:35:31.930 --> 01:35:34.681
Citizens state bank.
We don't have an exact figure...

01:35:34.716 --> 01:35:37.601
on how much was taken, but an
arrest was made... hey, listen!

01:35:37.636 --> 01:35:39.903
Within an hour
of the crime.

01:35:39.938 --> 01:35:42.405
The suspect's name
is frank salazar.

01:35:42.440 --> 01:35:46.109
He's from new jersey. He's also
been charged with the robberies...

01:35:46.144 --> 01:35:49.696
of the shop 'n go market and ford's
department store, and for stealing two cars.

01:35:50.196 --> 01:35:52.699
He's being held
at the ravalle county jail.

01:35:52.734 --> 01:35:54.701
The money, as yet,
has not been recovered...

01:35:55.201 --> 01:35:58.455
and bail has been set
at one million dollars.

01:35:58.490 --> 01:36:01.958
And now for sports.
The montana grizzlies began-

01:36:05.462 --> 01:36:08.465
whew. Gee.

01:36:08.965 --> 01:36:10.967
That's too bad.

01:36:14.337 --> 01:36:16.773
Oh, shit.

01:36:16.808 --> 01:36:19.376
You don't think frank
would talk, do ya?

01:36:22.195 --> 01:36:23.697
No.

01:36:27.200 --> 01:36:29.202
Do we have
a million dollars?

01:36:30.203 --> 01:36:32.205
More.

01:36:42.332 --> 01:36:44.334
Oh, no.

01:36:44.834 --> 01:36:49.639
Oh, no, you're not thinking
of bailing him out, are you?

01:36:49.674 --> 01:36:51.641
That would be stupid,
don't you think?

01:36:51.676 --> 01:36:54.644
Oh, no, you- no!
You're not gon-

01:36:54.679 --> 01:36:57.647
are you out
of your fuckin' mind?

01:36:59.649 --> 01:37:02.152
No! No, forget it.

01:37:02.187 --> 01:37:04.154
I'm out of here. You
guys do what you wanna do.

01:37:04.654 --> 01:37:08.158
That's fine. I'll just get
a bus or a taxi or something.

01:37:08.193 --> 01:37:11.661
I'm just gonna take my share here
plus, of course, expenses and things.

01:37:12.162 --> 01:37:14.164
Don't worry about me.
I'll write you from maui.

01:37:14.199 --> 01:37:16.166
I'll write you
in your nice, cold cell.

01:37:16.201 --> 01:37:19.669
I'll be on my nice, hot island
with a couple of college babes.

01:37:19.704 --> 01:37:23.173
You guys are out of your minds!
You should be in an insane asylum!

01:37:23.208 --> 01:37:26.176
Why you're in this business,
i don't know.

01:37:26.676 --> 01:37:29.479
Maybe you should open
a dry cleaners or something.

01:37:29.963 --> 01:37:32.465
Bail him out. Why, that is the
silliest thing i ever heard.

01:37:32.500 --> 01:37:34.467
I'll just take
some of this here.

01:37:34.502 --> 01:37:37.470
Maybe i can find a bus stop
or something, okay?

01:37:37.971 --> 01:37:39.973
I'll just take this
for a taxi or something.

01:37:40.473 --> 01:37:42.976
What are you doing?
Hey! Whoa!

01:37:43.011 --> 01:37:44.978
That's my money there!

01:37:45.013 --> 01:37:46.980
We're going back to get
frank! I don't wanna get frank.

01:37:49.017 --> 01:37:50.984
Has that dog had its shots?
Have you had your shots?

01:37:51.484 --> 01:37:54.487
We're gonna go get frank. No!
Hey! Don't forget the money!

01:37:54.522 --> 01:37:57.991
- He's getting the money!
- What's wrong with you guys?

01:37:58.026 --> 01:38:00.493
Let go of me!
What are you doing?

01:38:00.528 --> 01:38:02.796
Ohhh, shit!
