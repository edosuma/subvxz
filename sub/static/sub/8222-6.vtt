WEBVTT

00:00.747 --> 00:02.009
Attention, viewers...

00:02.082 --> 00:04.846
Do not try anything
you are about to see at home.

00:04.918 --> 00:07.284
We're what you call experts.

00:10.157 --> 00:13.854
NARRATOR: On this high-velocity
episode of "Mythbusters"...

00:13.927 --> 00:15.758
KARI:
You killed the dwarf!

00:15.829 --> 00:18.195
NARRATOR: Adam and Jamie
investigate yet another way

00:18.265 --> 00:19.755
your car could kill you...

00:19.833 --> 00:20.925
ADAM:
This is fun.

00:21.535 --> 00:22.365
Whoa!

00:22.436 --> 00:25.599
NARRATOR: As they test
the myth of exploding bumpers.

00:25.672 --> 00:27.333
This is actually really scary.

00:27.407 --> 00:29.705
NARRATOR: It's hot, smelly,
dangerous work.

00:29.776 --> 00:31.368
- We're fully armed?
- We're hot.

00:31.445 --> 00:33.538
NARRATOR:
And that's the way we like it.

00:34.681 --> 00:36.546
We may have overdone that.

00:36.616 --> 00:38.277
NARRATOR:
Then Kari, Tory, and Grant

00:38.352 --> 00:40.343
are on the edge
of their saddles...

00:40.420 --> 00:41.751
TORY:
Yeah! Got 'em!

00:41.822 --> 00:43.414
NARRATOR: As they challenge
an awesome myth

00:43.490 --> 00:45.014
of medieval cavalry.

00:45.092 --> 00:46.753
TORY: Grant, you're going
the wrong way!

00:46.827 --> 00:48.795
NARRATOR:
Can an expertly fired arrow

00:48.862 --> 00:52.821
really penetrate double deep
with a galloping start?

00:52.899 --> 00:55.231
And how far will they go
to prove the point?

00:55.302 --> 00:56.599
[Roaring]

00:56.670 --> 00:57.796
NARRATOR:
We're all "a-quiver."

01:00.474 --> 01:02.408
Who are the Mythbusters?

01:02.976 --> 01:04.705
- Adam Savage...
- Whoo!

01:04.778 --> 01:06.905
I ate a radio for science!

01:06.980 --> 01:07.947
NARRATOR:
...and Jamie Hyneman.

01:08.014 --> 01:09.811
[Grunts]
I'll deflect a bullet.

01:09.883 --> 01:11.817
NARRATOR:
Between them, more than 30 years

01:11.885 --> 01:14.285
of special-effects experience.

01:14.354 --> 01:15.787
There's your problem.
[Chuckles]

01:16.423 --> 01:19.051
NARRATOR:
Joining them... Tory Belleci...

01:19.526 --> 01:20.754
Punch through!

01:20.827 --> 01:22.089
NARRATOR:
...Grant lmahara...

01:22.162 --> 01:24.528
That's right.
I'm gonna build a robot.

01:24.598 --> 01:25.826
NARRATOR:
...and Kari Byron.

01:25.899 --> 01:27.696
This is gonna be
a whole lot of fun, huh?

01:27.768 --> 01:29.235
NARRATOR:
They don't just tell the myths.

01:29.302 --> 01:32.430
They put them to the test.

01:34.000 --> 01:40.074

01:47.120 --> 01:48.485
What are you doing?

01:48.555 --> 01:52.252
Is it time for, like,
fire-safety tips or something?

01:52.325 --> 01:53.724
In fact, it is.

01:53.794 --> 01:54.988
Today's fire-safety tip

01:55.061 --> 01:58.553
is don't stand near a car
that's on fire.

01:58.632 --> 01:59.997
Okay.

02:00.066 --> 02:01.090
Why?

02:01.168 --> 02:02.635
All right.
I'm glad you asked.

02:02.702 --> 02:04.829
Because it turns out
that some cars have a bumper

02:04.905 --> 02:06.873
attached to them
by a shock absorber.

02:06.940 --> 02:08.100
And this is to allow the bumper

02:08.175 --> 02:10.234
to absorb some of the hit
when it bumps into something.

02:10.310 --> 02:11.902
And then in a car fire,
that shock absorber

02:11.978 --> 02:13.445
can overheat and explode

02:13.513 --> 02:15.140
and send the bumper
shooting out,

02:15.215 --> 02:18.150
potentially kneecapping
anybody who's unfortunate enough

02:18.218 --> 02:21.847
to be standing in front of
or behind the car on fire.

02:21.922 --> 02:24.390
I sense a car fire
in our near future.

02:24.458 --> 02:26.289
I think it's definitely
something we should test.

02:26.359 --> 02:27.587
Okay.

02:27.661 --> 02:30.027
NARRATOR: Bumpers are designed
to protect your car,

02:30.096 --> 02:33.532
by absorbing some of the impact
from a low-speed collision.

02:33.600 --> 02:35.465
But if your car's on fire,

02:35.535 --> 02:38.629
this myth contends
that the gas-filled pistons

02:38.705 --> 02:40.138
can heat up to a point

02:40.207 --> 02:43.108
where the bumper becomes
a deadly projectile

02:43.176 --> 02:46.202
and its range
is an incredible 50 feet.

02:46.279 --> 02:47.678
As far as the methodology goes,

02:47.747 --> 02:49.044
I think it's
pretty straightforward.

02:49.115 --> 02:50.241
We just go to a junkyard,

02:50.317 --> 02:52.342
we get some bumpers
of the appropriate type,

02:52.419 --> 02:54.944
we subject them to some really
high heat, and we test them.

02:55.021 --> 02:57.080
Right,
but since this whole thing

02:57.157 --> 03:00.320
is about what happens
to these bumpers in a car fire,

03:00.393 --> 03:03.692
I think our very first step
is to simply set a car on fire

03:03.763 --> 03:05.128
and take some measurements
and readings

03:05.198 --> 03:07.223
to figure out
what kind of temperatures

03:07.300 --> 03:08.597
we're actually talking about.

03:08.668 --> 03:10.033
Agreed.

03:10.103 --> 03:12.367
NARRATOR: So the boys bowl up
to the bomb range

03:12.439 --> 03:14.304
to set a car on fire.

03:14.374 --> 03:16.968
This is familiar
"Mythbusters" territory.

03:17.043 --> 03:18.874
So, how hard can it be?

03:18.945 --> 03:21.175
Well, as hard
as you want to make it.

03:21.248 --> 03:23.580
- JAMIE: Whoa.
- [Metal creaking]

03:25.218 --> 03:26.742
[Chuckles]

03:26.820 --> 03:28.412
We're all right.

03:28.488 --> 03:30.251
What the hell are you doing?!

03:30.323 --> 03:31.688
Having some fun.

03:31.758 --> 03:33.521
NARRATOR:
Jamie's idea of fun

03:33.593 --> 03:37.051
is likely different
to yours, mine, and Adam's.

03:37.130 --> 03:38.961
Remember, kids,
you really can get in trouble

03:39.032 --> 03:40.966
with one of these things.

03:41.034 --> 03:42.831
[Laughs]

03:42.903 --> 03:44.871
NARRATOR:
It's an apt start to a day

03:44.938 --> 03:47.065
that will not go quite to plan.

03:47.140 --> 03:48.903
We have found
some potential cases

03:48.975 --> 03:50.101
of this actually happening...

03:50.176 --> 03:52.736
that maybe bumpers shot off
during car fires.

03:52.812 --> 03:55.076
And the researchers
have found us a make and model

03:55.148 --> 03:57.582
similar to those
in the reports that we have.

03:57.651 --> 04:00.017
So we're gonna
set this thing on fire,

04:00.086 --> 04:02.452
find out how hot a car fire
actually gets,

04:02.522 --> 04:04.251
take temperature readings
all around it.

04:04.324 --> 04:06.121
And if we're very lucky,

04:06.192 --> 04:08.490
maybe we'll get
a bumper shooting off.

04:08.562 --> 04:10.052
NARRATOR:
That would be a bonus.

04:10.130 --> 04:12.360
But remember,
their primary purpose

04:12.432 --> 04:15.299
is to see just how hot
a car fire gets.

04:15.368 --> 04:18.565
Fortunately, there's some
adult supervision on hand.

04:18.637 --> 04:19.161
Good morning.

04:19.238 --> 04:21.707
We got just a small car fire
we're gonna set

04:21.774 --> 04:23.834
and hopefully ask you guys
to put out.

04:23.910 --> 04:24.968
No problem, sir.

04:25.045 --> 04:28.037
NARRATOR: Adam draws on
boyhood skills to raise the car

04:28.114 --> 04:31.015
and strip the wheels
in next to no time.

04:31.084 --> 04:34.611
Here in California,
it's a crime to burn tires.

04:34.688 --> 04:35.848
For some reason,

04:35.922 --> 04:39.323
it's not a crime to wear
a silver suit with suspenders.

04:39.392 --> 04:42.384
As Adam slips into something
less comfortable,

04:42.462 --> 04:44.862
Jamie considers
the finer details.

04:44.931 --> 04:46.159
We're gonna light the car
on fire.

04:46.232 --> 04:49.827
And being as the engine
has fuel...

04:49.903 --> 04:52.167
it has oil,
it has plastic parts,

04:52.238 --> 04:55.503
it's got batteries
with electricity...

04:55.575 --> 04:57.133
you've got all the elements
you need

04:57.210 --> 04:59.007
to create an energetic fire.

04:59.079 --> 05:02.139
And that also happens to be
the area around the bumper.

05:02.215 --> 05:05.048
So that's where we're gonna
focus our ignition,

05:05.118 --> 05:07.211
and we'll see what happens.

05:07.787 --> 05:10.187
NARRATOR:
And just for good measure...

05:10.256 --> 05:11.518
ADAM:
[Laughs]

05:11.591 --> 05:13.320
NARRATOR:
When the car's ablaze,

05:13.393 --> 05:15.384
they'll get accurate
temperature measurements

05:15.462 --> 05:18.454
by circling it
with a thermal-imaging camera.

05:18.531 --> 05:19.463
ADAM:
That ought to do.

05:19.532 --> 05:21.227
- What do you think?
- Go for it.

05:22.135 --> 05:23.568
ADAM:
This is fun.

05:23.637 --> 05:24.865
NARRATOR:
But try as he might,

05:24.938 --> 05:27.566
Adam can't manage to set fire
to the engine,

05:27.641 --> 05:30.405
even though
it's swimming in gasoline.

05:31.978 --> 05:35.436
Making fire is something
even cavemen mastered.

05:35.515 --> 05:37.574
But we've struggled
with this before.

05:37.651 --> 05:41.917
Who could forget the shaky start
to "Trailblazers"?

05:42.455 --> 05:44.480
That's hard stuff to light.

05:46.059 --> 05:48.721
JAMIE: It only lights
when it gets mistified.

05:48.795 --> 05:49.727
[Lighter clicks]

05:49.796 --> 05:52.230
NARRATOR: This delayed ignition
is risky business.

05:52.298 --> 05:53.424
And statistically,

05:53.500 --> 05:55.991
it's getting more perilous
by the second.

05:56.069 --> 05:59.937
I mean, nothing's gone wrong
for almost 40 minutes.

06:00.006 --> 06:00.870
Whoa!

06:02.742 --> 06:05.233
- JAMIE: You all right?
- I'm okay.

06:05.311 --> 06:07.575
JAMIE: You got a little bit
of a haircut there, didn't you?

06:07.647 --> 06:09.410
ADAM: I got a little bit of a...
not a haircut.

06:09.482 --> 06:12.815
I got a little bit of a hair
on the back of my hand.

06:14.421 --> 06:16.184
NARRATOR:
Considering the rough start,

06:16.256 --> 06:19.692
the car is quickly engulfed
in flames.

06:21.428 --> 06:24.124
ADAM: It's all happening a lot
faster than I thought it would.

06:24.197 --> 06:26.722
JAMIE: That's one
out-of-control car fire.

06:26.800 --> 06:29.200
You were afraid that
it was gonna burn itself out.

06:29.269 --> 06:31.100
NARRATOR:
As the wind shifts,

06:31.171 --> 06:32.900
Adam's forced to move
the thermal camera

06:32.972 --> 06:34.303
20 feet to the left.

06:34.374 --> 06:37.309
Any thoughts of circling
the blaze are abandoned

06:37.377 --> 06:41.939
as the flames follow the smoke
in an unpredictable arc.

06:42.482 --> 06:44.245
JAMIE: Are you getting
any kind of a reading yet?

06:44.317 --> 06:47.912
Yeah. I'm actually getting
easily 1,000 degrees.

06:47.987 --> 06:51.582
- JAMIE: Okay.
- ADAM: 1,050, 1, 100.

06:51.658 --> 06:52.818
This is hot.

06:52.892 --> 06:54.985
[Laughs]

06:55.061 --> 06:56.551
NARRATOR:
At this point,

06:56.629 --> 07:00.395
a bumper flying 50 feet
would confirm the myth.

07:00.467 --> 07:03.265
The Skipper and Gilligan
could high-five each other,

07:03.336 --> 07:05.770
share a man hug, and head home.

07:05.839 --> 07:08.433
But it's just not
that kind of a day.

07:10.844 --> 07:12.812
JAMIE: Well, our pistons
are still there.

07:12.879 --> 07:15.404
[Laughing]
But the bumper is melted.

07:15.482 --> 07:17.450
JAMIE: And that actually
tells us something

07:17.517 --> 07:19.644
about what temperatures
were achieved,

07:19.719 --> 07:21.744
'cause the bumpers are aluminum,

07:21.821 --> 07:25.484
and aluminum melts
at around 660 Celsius.

07:25.558 --> 07:27.719
Well, riddle me this, Batman...

07:27.794 --> 07:29.659
What's the melting point
of glass?

07:29.729 --> 07:30.991
Look at that!

07:31.064 --> 07:32.929
I've never seen anything
like that.

07:32.999 --> 07:34.660
That's even hotter
because that melts

07:34.734 --> 07:37.430
at around 1,400 Celsius.

07:38.004 --> 07:39.995
NARRATOR: There's no doubt
they had the heat...

07:40.073 --> 07:43.270
an impressive
1,400 degrees Celsius.

07:43.343 --> 07:45.641
And that's what they came here
to measure.

07:45.712 --> 07:49.079
Still, the bumpers
didn't go ballistic.

07:49.149 --> 07:51.140
Of course,
they're designed not to.

07:51.217 --> 07:52.809
But there are those who swear

07:52.886 --> 07:54.911
they've seen this myth
in action.

07:54.988 --> 07:56.353
JAMIE:
What this tells us

07:56.422 --> 07:59.858
is that this is a very, very
specific set of circumstances

07:59.926 --> 08:02.258
that is required
to make this happen.

08:02.328 --> 08:04.626
I think now we've got to go
back to the shop,

08:04.697 --> 08:06.995
work on some
individual shocks...

08:07.066 --> 08:09.864
heating them and seeing
what kind of results we can get.

08:10.436 --> 08:11.926
JAMIE:
So, how's your hand?

08:12.005 --> 08:14.701
ADAM: Eh, it hurts a little bit,
but it'll be better by tomorrow.

08:14.774 --> 08:16.036
JAMIE:
And you've got another one.

08:16.109 --> 08:18.100
ADAM: [Laughs]
I do.

08:23.883 --> 08:26.351
You know, you guys,
ever since we did "Hwacha,"

08:26.419 --> 08:28.887
I've really wanted to do some
more medieval-weaponry myths.

08:28.955 --> 08:30.980
That is perfect, 'cause
we have one that comes out

08:31.057 --> 08:33.355
of the Hungarian army
during the 1500s.

08:33.426 --> 08:35.519
Now, apparently they believed
that an archer

08:35.595 --> 08:37.756
riding on the back
of a galloping horse,

08:37.831 --> 08:39.264
if he were to shoot an arrow,

08:39.332 --> 08:41.527
that arrow would have twice
the penetrating power

08:41.601 --> 08:44.034
as an archer firing an arrow
standing still.

08:44.102 --> 08:45.502
Sounds like a myth to me.

08:45.572 --> 08:46.834
I know.
It's hard to believe, right?

08:46.906 --> 08:48.999
Physics, history.
Let's do it!

08:49.075 --> 08:51.373
[Chuckles]
Two of my worst subjects.

08:51.444 --> 08:54.277
NARRATOR: Back in the 1500s,
Hungarian archers

08:54.347 --> 08:57.077
were the most skilled
and feared warriors in Europe.

08:57.150 --> 09:01.143
In fact, archery was practiced
as a martial art.

09:01.221 --> 09:04.315
And the boldest claim made
by these master bowmen

09:04.390 --> 09:07.382
was that they could actually
get twice the penetration

09:07.460 --> 09:11.191
when the arrow was shot from
the back of a galloping horse.

09:11.264 --> 09:12.356
Okay, so it sounds like

09:12.432 --> 09:14.662
we need to get our hands
on a medieval-style bow,

09:14.734 --> 09:17.259
fire arrows at the target
from a stationary position

09:17.337 --> 09:19.931
and then gallop at the target
and fire arrows again.

09:20.006 --> 09:20.768
TORY: Right.

09:20.840 --> 09:22.967
Then we'll look at the two sets
of arrows and see which ones

09:23.042 --> 09:25.010
- go deeper into the target.
- Wait a minute.

09:25.078 --> 09:28.241
So if you're firing a bow
from atop of the horse,

09:28.314 --> 09:31.044
that means you have no hands
to hold on to the reins.

09:31.117 --> 09:33.210
And don't they gallop
at like 40 miles an hour?

09:33.286 --> 09:34.048
Exactly.

09:34.120 --> 09:36.554
That's why you have to be
an expert horse rider.

09:36.623 --> 09:37.954
What could possibly go wrong?

09:38.024 --> 09:39.286
[Horse neighs]

09:39.359 --> 09:42.328
NARRATOR: Custer's very words
to the 7 th Cavalry

09:42.395 --> 09:43.487
at Little Bighorn.

09:43.563 --> 09:45.724
The team has wisely chosen
a venue

09:45.798 --> 09:49.234
that specializes
in mounted archery.

09:49.302 --> 09:50.269
[Dog barks]

09:50.336 --> 09:52.566
Give him a little squeeze
and a click.

09:52.639 --> 09:54.698
[Clicks tongue]

09:54.774 --> 09:57.334
That way.
That way.

09:57.410 --> 09:58.502
Yeah. Okay.

09:58.578 --> 10:00.478
That wasn't the way
I wanted to go.

10:00.546 --> 10:02.878
He's got steering.
It's just not power steering.

10:02.949 --> 10:04.814
That way.
Hard left.

10:04.884 --> 10:07.284
NARRATOR:
Forget archery at the gallop.

10:07.353 --> 10:09.446
Let's see
if these amateur light horsemen

10:09.522 --> 10:10.989
can shoot from a saunter.

10:11.057 --> 10:12.490
TORY:
I think we're ready to attack.

10:12.558 --> 10:15.220
NARRATOR: Grant's the first
to try his luck.

10:15.795 --> 10:17.660
[Groans, laughs]

10:19.465 --> 10:21.433
Interesting strategy, Grant.

10:21.501 --> 10:23.696
NARRATOR: "Interesting"
isn't quite the word.

10:23.770 --> 10:25.738
Grant, you're going
the wrong way!

10:25.805 --> 10:26.999
Attack!

10:27.073 --> 10:30.133
NARRATOR: A man with a drawn bow
on a wayward horse

10:30.209 --> 10:33.007
is a deadly threat
to all and sundry.

10:33.079 --> 10:34.706
TORY:
Use the "horse," Grant.

10:34.781 --> 10:36.681
GRANT: [Laughing]
"Use the 'horse."'

10:36.749 --> 10:38.341
Oh, ho ho!

10:38.418 --> 10:40.978
NARRATOR: More by good luck
than good management,

10:41.054 --> 10:43.579
the horse eventually turns
toward the target.

10:43.656 --> 10:45.681
GRANT: Try not to shoot
the horse in the head, Grant.

10:46.626 --> 10:48.787
Oh! So close!

10:48.861 --> 10:51.523
NARRATOR: Kari's horse has
a much better sense of direction

10:51.597 --> 10:54.589
but, still,
no sense of occasion.

10:54.667 --> 10:56.794
Go faster.
[Clicks tongue]

10:58.938 --> 11:00.997
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

11:01.074 --> 11:03.372
Now, if we could just do that
a little faster.

11:03.443 --> 11:04.910
[Laughs]

11:05.445 --> 11:07.140
NARRATOR:
At least she hit the target.

11:07.213 --> 11:10.614
Let's see if Tory can do it
a little faster.

11:12.785 --> 11:14.480
Yeah! Got 'em!
[Laughs]

11:14.554 --> 11:16.454
NARRATOR: Not bad at all,
but we're testing a myth

11:16.522 --> 11:20.185
based on the best
mounted archers in history.

11:20.259 --> 11:23.660
There's no point in our guys
taking a static comparison shot.

11:23.730 --> 11:27.359
It's time to saddle up
the professionals.

11:27.867 --> 11:29.994
Now, the three pieces of data
that we need

11:30.069 --> 11:32.128
are the speed of the horse...

11:33.773 --> 11:36.435
...the terminal velocity
of the arrow...

11:38.044 --> 11:39.272
...and then finally,

11:39.345 --> 11:42.007
the thing about which
this myth is truly about,

11:42.081 --> 11:43.844
is the penetration of the arrow.

11:46.452 --> 11:48.215
NARRATOR:
So the team demotes itself

11:48.287 --> 11:51.279
to setting up the gizmos
that should accurately measure

11:51.357 --> 11:54.155
the speed of the arrow
and the penetration.

11:54.227 --> 11:56.855
We're also gonna be measuring
the speed of the horses.

11:56.929 --> 11:58.453
So I've got this radar gun.

11:58.531 --> 11:59.691
Gonna point it at the horses,

11:59.766 --> 12:02.326
and it'll give us their speed
in miles per hour.

12:03.369 --> 12:05.564
NARRATOR:
First up, Lukas, Katie, and Holm

12:05.638 --> 12:07.970
take a bunch of shots
from a standing start.

12:08.041 --> 12:11.101
This is the key control data
they'll need

12:11.177 --> 12:14.010
to compare with arrows
fired at the gallop.

12:14.080 --> 12:16.981
Average arrow speed is right
on the money for the myth...

12:17.050 --> 12:21.009
between 130 and 140
miles per hour.

12:21.087 --> 12:24.420
61/8 inches deep into the foam.

12:24.490 --> 12:26.685
83/8 inches.

12:26.759 --> 12:28.351
103/4 inches.

12:28.428 --> 12:30.726
NARRATOR:
And now for some real riding.

12:30.797 --> 12:32.662
Top speed for light cavalry

12:32.732 --> 12:35.223
is reckoned at close
to 40 miles per hour.

12:35.301 --> 12:37.235
So to properly test the myth,

12:37.303 --> 12:40.602
they all need to hit 40
and hit the target.

12:40.673 --> 12:41.970
TORY:
Wow. Nice shot.

12:42.041 --> 12:44.976
You notice she smiles
the entire time?

12:45.044 --> 12:46.511
Like, "Oh, yeah, whatever."

12:46.579 --> 12:49.605
She's galloping at 44 miles
an hour and hitting the target.

12:49.682 --> 12:50.774
I'd be smiling, too.

12:54.754 --> 12:57.018
NARRATOR:
Every arrow that hits home...

12:57.090 --> 12:59.752
TORY:
Dang, she is good!

12:59.826 --> 13:02.488
NARRATOR: Gets wrenched out
and measured.

13:02.562 --> 13:04.154
111/2 inches.

13:04.230 --> 13:05.822
121/2 inches.

13:05.898 --> 13:08.492
NARRATOR: On average,
the penetration is deeper,

13:08.568 --> 13:12.163
but not by much, suggesting
that this medieval myth

13:12.238 --> 13:13.762
might be horse manure.

13:13.840 --> 13:16.206
But the data
just isn't consistent enough

13:16.275 --> 13:17.537
to make a call.

13:17.610 --> 13:20.704
Three different archers,
three different horses,

13:20.780 --> 13:24.944
arrows fired at different speeds
from a variable distance.

13:25.017 --> 13:26.678
The data is diabolical.

13:26.752 --> 13:28.083
KARI:
Our riders did really great.

13:28.154 --> 13:30.782
I mean, they were accurate,
and they had a great speed.

13:30.857 --> 13:32.119
Unfortunately,

13:32.191 --> 13:35.251
all of these numbers
are just not consistent enough

13:35.328 --> 13:37.626
to give us
a really good conclusion.

13:38.197 --> 13:39.994
Nothing here
really supports the myth,

13:40.066 --> 13:42.626
but I'm afraid that our margin
of error is way too big.

13:42.702 --> 13:45.227
I mean, we've got moving horses,

13:45.304 --> 13:47.670
and of course
human error is involved here.

13:47.740 --> 13:49.799
So I think we really need
to take this back to the shop,

13:49.876 --> 13:51.104
see what variables
we can cut out,

13:51.177 --> 13:53.907
and see if we can just find
the core of this myth,

13:53.980 --> 13:56.471
which is,
will the momentum of movement

13:56.549 --> 13:58.540
add penetration to the shot?

14:00.887 --> 14:03.082
NARRATOR: Testing the myth
of exploding bumpers,

14:03.156 --> 14:07.388
Adam and Jamie torched a car
to see just how hot it burns...

14:07.460 --> 14:10.486
around 1,400 degrees Celsius.

14:10.563 --> 14:12.258
Whoa!

14:13.833 --> 14:16.097
NARRATOR: The car fared
much worse than Adam...

14:16.169 --> 14:18.194
I'm totally all right.
It just scared me.

14:18.271 --> 14:21.570
NARRATOR: But the bumpers
failed to blast off.

14:21.641 --> 14:23.541
Well, our pistons
are still there.

14:23.609 --> 14:26.544
ADAM: [Laughing]
But the bumper is melted.

14:27.113 --> 14:28.546
NARRATOR:
Time for a pit stop

14:28.614 --> 14:30.582
to pick up the parts
they'll need...

14:30.650 --> 14:31.981
Yeah, this one's it.

14:32.051 --> 14:34.212
NARRATOR: Specifically,
the kind of bumper shocks

14:34.287 --> 14:36.221
that supposedly launched
the legend.

14:36.289 --> 14:38.416
JAMIE: Like little rockets
right there, huh?

14:38.491 --> 14:41.426
You've got an internal sleeve
and an external sleeve.

14:41.494 --> 14:43.189
And when you hit something
at a slow speed,

14:43.262 --> 14:44.923
the internal sleeve
moves slightly.

14:44.997 --> 14:46.726
It's pushing against
some kind of gas,

14:46.799 --> 14:48.926
and that hopefully
reduces damage to the car.

14:49.001 --> 14:51.697
But when you heat that gas
that it's pushing against,

14:51.771 --> 14:55.707
it expands, causing this thing
to fail catastrophically,

14:55.775 --> 14:57.504
and maybe hurt some safety
personnel in the vicinity.

14:57.577 --> 14:59.977
At least that's the theory.
That's what we've got to test.

15:00.046 --> 15:01.809
NARRATOR:
They'll start the testing

15:01.881 --> 15:03.439
without the actual bumper,

15:03.516 --> 15:06.917
because these are
the alleged culprits.

15:07.453 --> 15:09.921
Adam sets up the blast screen...

15:10.690 --> 15:14.990
...as Jamie spot-welds
a steel tube to a heavy stand.

15:15.061 --> 15:17.529
At a certain point,
we suspect we're gonna reach

15:17.597 --> 15:20.065
a critical kind of heat level,

15:20.132 --> 15:23.727
where the gas pressure exceeds
what this chamber will hold

15:23.803 --> 15:27.000
and this shoots out this way
at high velocity.

15:27.073 --> 15:29.337
NARRATOR:
Adam attaches a thermocouple

15:29.408 --> 15:31.467
to monitor
the surface temperature.

15:31.544 --> 15:33.671
And now for the heat source.

15:33.746 --> 15:36.237
Jamie lights
an oxyacetylene torch,

15:36.315 --> 15:37.543
and they're good to go.

15:37.617 --> 15:38.743
Moving it in.

15:38.818 --> 15:40.046
ADAM:
All right.

15:40.586 --> 15:42.110
That looks good.

15:42.188 --> 15:44.019
JAMIE:
Try not to bump that.

15:44.090 --> 15:45.455
Temperature's rising fast.

15:45.524 --> 15:48.459
10 seconds in,
we're at 50 degrees Celsius.

15:48.527 --> 15:49.755
NARRATOR:
They don't expect this

15:49.829 --> 15:51.820
to get quite as hot
as the car fire.

15:51.897 --> 15:55.731
After all,
that was 1,400 degrees Celsius.

15:55.801 --> 15:58.827
The aim here is to see
if directional heat works

15:58.904 --> 16:01.668
where an unfocused inferno
failed.

16:01.741 --> 16:04.107
ADAM: Any predictions
as to when it's gonna blow?

16:04.677 --> 16:07.976
- I'm guessing 620 degrees.
- JAMIE: I don't know.

16:08.047 --> 16:11.505
All I do know is that
right there is a pipe bomb.

16:11.584 --> 16:13.552
ADAM:
It's at about 500 Fahrenheit,

16:13.619 --> 16:17.680
295 Celsius.

16:17.757 --> 16:20.123
You know,
this is actually really scary.

16:20.192 --> 16:21.250
ADAM: I agree.

16:21.327 --> 16:23.090
Ho! Ho! Ho!

16:23.162 --> 16:25.323
Looks like we've got
some kind of failure.

16:25.398 --> 16:26.592
NARRATOR:
Nine minutes in,

16:26.666 --> 16:29.635
with the temperature
just past 400 degrees,

16:29.702 --> 16:32.500
toxic smoke starts to billow
from the piston.

16:32.571 --> 16:34.562
No one knows for sure
what it is,

16:34.640 --> 16:39.043
but the noxious smell is enough
to put the fear into everyone.

16:39.111 --> 16:40.601
- Are you gonna turn it off?
- Yeah.

16:40.680 --> 16:43.171
It's just making a lot of smoke.
I think we've lost pressure.

16:43.249 --> 16:45.547
All right. Let's all
clear out of here and evacuate.

16:45.618 --> 16:46.778
- This place is getting toxic.
- Yeah.

16:46.852 --> 16:48.444
- Who knows what that is?
- Yeah.

16:48.521 --> 16:50.921
NARRATOR: When the smoke clears
and the piston cools,

16:50.990 --> 16:51.922
they decide to do

16:51.991 --> 16:54.687
what maybe they should have done
first off...

16:54.760 --> 16:58.355
cut the darn thing in half
to see how it works.

17:01.133 --> 17:03.033
Oh, interesting.

17:03.102 --> 17:05.366
JAMIE: There's an O-ring
in there, actually.

17:05.438 --> 17:07.098
Yeah, and some melted plastic.

17:07.173 --> 17:10.300
NARRATOR: They know that
somewhere inside the inner tube

17:10.376 --> 17:11.536
is a fluid chamber,

17:11.609 --> 17:14.909
and somewhere else, there's
a compressed-gas chamber.

17:14.980 --> 17:17.039
And that's
what they're looking for.

17:17.116 --> 17:18.377
JAMIE:
I don't get this at all.

17:18.451 --> 17:21.113
NARRATOR: Just as confusion
hits critical mass...

17:21.186 --> 17:23.484
So, it looks like
that is the gas chamber.

17:23.556 --> 17:26.616
So one way or another,
that's where the heat has to go.

17:26.692 --> 17:28.182
We were heating it up
at the other end.

17:28.260 --> 17:31.195
Yeah. So we got to put the flame
right on the end of this.

17:31.263 --> 17:33.163
And hopefully it won't melt
the seals.

17:33.232 --> 17:34.062
Hopefully.

17:34.133 --> 17:37.193
NARRATOR: Test two proceeds
with a more focussed flame,

17:37.269 --> 17:39.396
hopefully raising the heat
so fast

17:39.472 --> 17:42.600
that the gas explodes
before the sealing ring melts

17:42.675 --> 17:45.940
and lets it dissipate
disappointingly safely.

17:46.011 --> 17:47.842
ADAM: We're getting the back end
as hot as possible

17:47.913 --> 17:49.210
as fast as possible.

17:49.782 --> 17:51.409
NARRATOR:
But these smoke signals

17:51.484 --> 17:54.112
are not sending
a hopeful message.

17:54.186 --> 17:56.586
Does that mean
I'm burning a hole?

17:56.655 --> 17:58.589
[Snap, hiss]

17:58.657 --> 18:01.524
[Laughs]
That means you burned a hole.

18:01.594 --> 18:02.720
[Timer beeps]

18:02.795 --> 18:04.456
52 seconds.

18:05.464 --> 18:08.592
I'll bet that hole
is part of the design process.

18:08.667 --> 18:11.693
I'll bet that's made to fail
just in that exact way.

18:11.771 --> 18:15.298
This thing is made to not blow.
How are we gonna get it to blow?

18:15.941 --> 18:17.772
NARRATOR:
Don't you hate it when something

18:17.843 --> 18:19.003
you've paid good money for

18:19.078 --> 18:21.706
won't break the way
you want it to?

18:21.781 --> 18:25.239
As for blowing this thing
the mythical 50 feet,

18:25.317 --> 18:27.979
50 miles looks just as likely.

18:28.053 --> 18:30.283
This is failing,
but it's failing safely.

18:30.356 --> 18:31.846
We don't want a safe failure.

18:31.924 --> 18:33.516
We want a kaboom.

18:33.592 --> 18:35.856
We want this thing
to become a projectile.

18:35.928 --> 18:37.987
So next thing we're thinking of

18:38.063 --> 18:39.553
is putting heat
right here at the neck,

18:39.632 --> 18:42.726
away from this safety release,
away from this O-ring,

18:42.802 --> 18:43.894
away from this plastic,

18:43.969 --> 18:47.097
hopefully to get enough pressure
in this gas chamber

18:47.173 --> 18:49.539
to cause the catastrophic
failure we're looking for.

18:51.076 --> 18:52.907
- JAMIE: The metal.
- ADAM: That looks good.

18:52.978 --> 18:54.775
- JAMIE: Okay.
- ADAM: Great.

18:55.347 --> 18:57.338
JAMIE: Oh, it's getting it
red hot there.

18:58.751 --> 19:00.810
Yeah, that's really fast.

19:00.886 --> 19:02.513
NARRATOR:
And a rapid heat spike

19:02.588 --> 19:04.647
might just do the trick.

19:05.157 --> 19:06.886
[Air hisses]

19:06.959 --> 19:09.120
Then again, it might not.

19:09.195 --> 19:10.719
Too much heat too quickly.

19:10.796 --> 19:12.024
Too much heat too quickly.

19:12.097 --> 19:15.555
NARRATOR: This failure to launch
becomes all the more frustrating

19:15.634 --> 19:17.659
when Adam and Jamie
get new intelligence

19:17.736 --> 19:18.703
from the researchers.

19:18.771 --> 19:20.932
They've found a real live person

19:21.006 --> 19:25.409
who's experienced a genuine
exploding-bumper event.

19:25.478 --> 19:29.608
Oakland firefighter Jennifer
Schmid wasn't just a witness.

19:29.682 --> 19:31.309
She was a casualty.

19:31.383 --> 19:32.816
Can you tell us what happened?

19:32.885 --> 19:33.874
Sure.

19:33.953 --> 19:35.978
We got called one night

19:36.055 --> 19:38.683
for a vehicle fire
in someone's driveway

19:38.757 --> 19:39.781
up next to a house.

19:39.859 --> 19:42.191
When we got there,
the car was on fire.

19:42.261 --> 19:45.924
So I pulled the hose line
around to the side of the car...

19:45.998 --> 19:48.466
the right side...
and started to put the nozzle

19:48.534 --> 19:51.298
up under the wheel well
to put the flames out.

19:51.370 --> 19:52.667
And that's when we heard

19:52.738 --> 19:55.036
the first of two explosions
at that point.

19:55.107 --> 19:56.267
I thought, initially,

19:56.342 --> 19:58.640
that it was the right front tire
that exploded,

19:58.711 --> 20:00.736
'cause I've heard and seen that
several times

20:00.813 --> 20:01.745
during car fires.

20:01.814 --> 20:03.509
And I moved in front of the car.

20:03.582 --> 20:06.380
And just as I opened the nozzle,
we heard another explosion,

20:06.452 --> 20:09.012
and that's when something
hit my legs.

20:09.088 --> 20:12.888
And I was knocked to the ground
and started yelling for help.

20:12.958 --> 20:14.186
I had no idea what happened.

20:14.260 --> 20:16.251
ADAM: So it turned out to be
the bumper that hit you?

20:16.328 --> 20:18.091
SCHM ID: Yes,
and they brought the bumpers,

20:18.163 --> 20:19.892
actually, to the hospital
to show me.

20:19.965 --> 20:23.196
So it was kind of scary
to see that.

20:23.269 --> 20:25.032
What were the extent
of your injuries?

20:25.104 --> 20:26.833
Well, the bumper hit both legs,

20:26.906 --> 20:29.636
but it only broke
my left lower leg,

20:29.708 --> 20:32.905
and it broke both bones...
the tibia and the fibula.

20:32.978 --> 20:35.538
The tibia was broken
in about 20 pieces.

20:35.614 --> 20:36.376
Wow!

20:36.448 --> 20:38.916
So, pretty significant.

20:38.984 --> 20:43.216
NARRATOR: But our myth from the
fan site is a bit more extreme.

20:43.289 --> 20:45.883
There's no doubt
that Jennifer was badly injured,

20:45.958 --> 20:50.657
but bits of this bumper
flew 15 feet, not 50.

20:50.729 --> 20:54.130
Still, this firsthand account
of Jen's trauma

20:54.199 --> 20:57.032
inspires Adam
to rethink his methods.

20:57.102 --> 20:58.967
ADAM: The difference between
our setup and the real world

20:59.038 --> 21:01.529
is that that shock
is usually mounted to a bumper,

21:01.607 --> 21:04.405
and the bumper in question
is a massive piece of aluminum

21:04.476 --> 21:06.910
about a quarter-inch thick
that is acting as a heat sink...

21:06.979 --> 21:11.143
i.e., it is pulling heat away
from the end of that bumper,

21:11.216 --> 21:12.774
exactly where we're finding

21:12.851 --> 21:15.115
one of the most effective
safety valves.

21:15.187 --> 21:17.587
So we're going to bolt back
a piece of bumper

21:17.656 --> 21:19.419
onto that shock,
heat it in the same place,

21:19.491 --> 21:21.857
and see if we get
a different result.

21:23.228 --> 21:24.252
[Clangs]

21:24.330 --> 21:26.798
There you go.
One big heat sink coming up.

21:26.865 --> 21:29.425
NARRATOR: And a finishing touch
from Jamie.

21:29.501 --> 21:31.025
This is perforated metal.

21:31.103 --> 21:34.231
I'm gonna wire a couple
of these pieces on there,

21:34.306 --> 21:37.070
and so hopefully
this will spread the heat out

21:37.142 --> 21:40.009
to where we don't end up
with a red-hot molten area

21:40.079 --> 21:41.444
that will burst the chamber

21:41.513 --> 21:44.004
before it, like,
explodes the way we want it to.

21:44.083 --> 21:45.778
I hope this one works.

21:45.851 --> 21:46.875
Me too.

21:47.720 --> 21:51.053
These one-in-a-million myths
kick our ass every time.

21:51.123 --> 21:53.284
NARRATOR:
And these two must have targets

21:53.359 --> 21:55.759
tattooed on their own
rear bumpers.

21:55.828 --> 21:57.125
After five minutes...

21:57.196 --> 21:59.357
- [Air hisses]
- ADAM: Oh.

21:59.431 --> 22:01.296
- That was it.
- Where did that come from?

22:01.367 --> 22:04.268
Looks like it blew a hole
in that front part.

22:04.336 --> 22:05.769
JAMIE:
Where it did before?

22:05.838 --> 22:06.770
ADAM: Yeah.

22:06.839 --> 22:08.170
Damn it!

22:08.240 --> 22:10.470
I don't think we can do
anything more with this.

22:10.542 --> 22:12.840
NARRATOR: It could take
a lifetime of testing

22:12.911 --> 22:16.904
to replicate what must be
a one-in-a-million occurrence,

22:16.982 --> 22:19.314
and the boys
might have better things to do

22:19.385 --> 22:20.716
with their twilight years.

22:20.786 --> 22:23.050
I think we have to abandon it.

22:23.122 --> 22:24.714
NARRATOR: But if you think
they're giving up

22:24.790 --> 22:26.917
before we see a bumper
go ballistic,

22:26.992 --> 22:29.392
just remember,
you're watching "Mythbusters."

22:29.461 --> 22:30.120
1!

22:33.732 --> 22:37.259
NARRATOR: Despite the best
efforts of our amateurs...

22:37.336 --> 22:39.964
TORY: Yeah! Got 'em!
[Laughs]

22:40.039 --> 22:43.270
NARRATOR: And the pros,
inconsistent data means

22:43.342 --> 22:47.039
that our medieval-archery myth
remains unresolved.

22:47.112 --> 22:48.409
The legend we're testing

22:48.480 --> 22:50.880
is that expert
Eastern European archers

22:50.949 --> 22:54.350
got twice the penetration
shooting from horseback.

22:54.420 --> 22:56.149
To bust or confirm it,

22:56.221 --> 22:59.622
man and beast
need to take a backseat.

22:59.692 --> 23:02.160
Mounted archers were amazing.

23:02.227 --> 23:04.661
But the results... just not
consistent enough to call it.

23:04.730 --> 23:06.459
Yeah, to make this
an accurate experiment,

23:06.532 --> 23:08.363
we need to have
the speed of the horse,

23:08.434 --> 23:11.562
the speed of the arrow, and
the accuracy all be repeatable.

23:11.637 --> 23:13.002
And with humans and horses
in the equation,

23:13.072 --> 23:14.232
that's just not gonna happen.

23:14.306 --> 23:16.171
All right, well,
why don't we get rid of both?

23:16.241 --> 23:17.765
We'll replace the bow
with a crossbow

23:17.843 --> 23:19.606
that's calibrated
to a medieval bow,

23:19.678 --> 23:21.475
and then we'll replace the horse
with a vehicle.

23:21.547 --> 23:22.639
So that way, we make sure

23:22.715 --> 23:24.615
it's going at the same speed
every time.

23:24.683 --> 23:25.809
And to make sure
that we're firing

23:25.884 --> 23:28.352
from the same place every time,
we can mount the crossbow.

23:28.420 --> 23:29.478
This is gonna be great.

23:29.555 --> 23:31.989
I know the perfect vehicle.
I'll go get it.

23:33.225 --> 23:35.523
Okay, he'd better not
be going for my car.

23:35.594 --> 23:37.425
But then you'll have a crossbow
attached to your car.

23:37.496 --> 23:38.428
[Horse neighs]

23:38.497 --> 23:39.691
GRANT:
[Laughs]

23:39.765 --> 23:42.165
NARRATOR:
Kari's wheels are safe for now.

23:42.234 --> 23:45.135
Grant's already sourced
a replacement horse

23:45.204 --> 23:49.800
that will do 40 miles per hour
every time, guaranteed.

23:49.875 --> 23:51.934
TORY: Oh, my God!
It's perfect!

23:52.010 --> 23:54.308
NARRATOR: The Jeep comes fitted
with what looks like

23:54.379 --> 23:55.971
a .50-cal. machine gun.

23:56.048 --> 23:57.174
Does this work?

23:57.249 --> 23:59.217
No, no, it's a replica.
[Laughs]

23:59.284 --> 24:02.981
NARRATOR: Tory plans to replace
that with a compound crossbow.

24:03.055 --> 24:05.523
Naturally,
he'll have to test it first.

24:05.591 --> 24:08.025
So now for one of those
definitive

24:08.093 --> 24:10.425
"don't try this at home"
moments.

24:22.574 --> 24:23.973
Well, it looks like
it's accurate.

24:24.042 --> 24:27.569
Now whether or not
it's consistent... I'll find out.

24:27.646 --> 24:29.637
NARRATOR:
While Tory sets the platform

24:29.715 --> 24:33.116
for a more credible set
of crossbow tests...

24:34.253 --> 24:36.414
...Kari carves out
a hood ornament

24:36.488 --> 24:39.457
that honors the origins
of the myth.

24:39.958 --> 24:41.858
KARI: We have to take
the horse out of the equation,

24:41.927 --> 24:43.485
but I don't want to take it out
entirely

24:43.562 --> 24:44.893
'cause, really,
it's the essence of the myth.

24:44.963 --> 24:46.260
So I'm gonna dress up our car

24:46.331 --> 24:48.492
so it looks a little more
like a horse.

24:48.567 --> 24:50.626
NARRATOR:
Meantime, Tory's found a target

24:50.702 --> 24:53.535
to test the consistency
of the penetration.

24:53.605 --> 24:56.165
That would be
the back of Grant's head.

24:56.942 --> 24:58.534
[Laughs]

25:01.446 --> 25:04.506
NARRATOR: As you'd expect, the
damage done to the jelly brain

25:04.583 --> 25:06.983
is almost the same
from each shot.

25:07.052 --> 25:08.713
21/8 inches.

25:08.787 --> 25:11.688
NARRATOR: And Tory's fine-tuned
the bow speed

25:11.757 --> 25:14.692
back to a more leisurely
medieval pace.

25:14.760 --> 25:16.921
We're taking out
a few variables here

25:16.995 --> 25:19.429
so we can just get down
to that one little question.

25:19.498 --> 25:22.934
Our horse is now a car horse.

25:23.001 --> 25:24.730
That way, we don't have
all of the jostling

25:24.803 --> 25:26.168
and we have a constant speed.

25:26.238 --> 25:28.206
Because the horses,
they just weren't getting it

25:28.273 --> 25:30.503
when I was explaining to them
to go one speed.

25:30.576 --> 25:32.737
NARRATOR:
With a horse head to the fore

25:32.811 --> 25:34.438
and a horse tail aft,

25:34.513 --> 25:38.005
this custom Jeep
is undeniably one-of-a-kind,

25:38.083 --> 25:40.415
especially when the whole thing
is sprayed

25:40.485 --> 25:42.715
in "we mean business" black.

25:42.788 --> 25:44.449
KARI: "Black Shoot-y."
That's her name.

25:44.523 --> 25:46.718
Black Shoot-y.
Get it?

25:47.259 --> 25:49.853
NARRATOR: But Grant's head
is way too small

25:49.928 --> 25:52.226
to be a viable target.

25:52.297 --> 25:55.061
So the man himself
offers up an alternative

25:55.133 --> 25:56.532
with a similar density

25:56.602 --> 25:59.196
to the flesh
of a barbarian enemy.

25:59.271 --> 26:01.637
Now, this foam is gonna make
a great target

26:01.707 --> 26:04.403
for comparing the penetrating
power of our arrows.

26:04.476 --> 26:06.137
But I think it's missing
a little something.

26:06.211 --> 26:08.839
I think it's missing
that hint of realism.

26:08.914 --> 26:11.906
NARRATOR: Time to dress down
for the occasion.

26:11.984 --> 26:13.212
What exactly are we?

26:13.285 --> 26:15.310
We're ancient warriors.

26:15.387 --> 26:17.048
It's not really
very accurate, but...

26:17.122 --> 26:19.750
Yeah.
We're the invading horde.

26:19.825 --> 26:22.259
- [Laughs]
- Okay? All right.

26:22.327 --> 26:23.988
- This isn't the History Channel.
- GRANT: Yeah.

26:24.062 --> 26:26.223
NARRATOR: Grant sets the timer
on the camera,

26:26.298 --> 26:30.234
and the crew do their best
to say "cheese" in barbarian.

26:30.302 --> 26:31.394
[Roaring]

26:31.470 --> 26:33.404
NARRATOR:
We're left with a happy snap

26:33.472 --> 26:37.806
well and truly fit
for a big foam dart board.

26:37.876 --> 26:40.071
- KARI: [Coughs]
- Good. I thought that was good.

26:40.145 --> 26:41.476
Yeah, it felt convincing to me.

26:41.546 --> 26:43.480
I felt angry.
That was good.

26:45.884 --> 26:48.478
NARRATOR: It's one thing
to ride a horse at speed

26:48.553 --> 26:49.952
without falling off.

26:50.022 --> 26:51.649
It's at least twice as hard

26:51.723 --> 26:53.918
to drop the reins
and shoot an arrow.

26:54.493 --> 26:57.621
But will that arrow get
twice the penetration?

26:57.696 --> 26:59.391
TORY:
I think we're ready to attack.

26:59.464 --> 27:01.830
NARRATOR: Kari, Tory, and Grant
began testing

27:01.900 --> 27:03.663
their medieval-archery myth

27:03.735 --> 27:07.136
with real horses
and a handheld bow.

27:07.205 --> 27:09.435
Oh! So close!

27:09.508 --> 27:11.305
NARRATOR:
For the sake of consistency,

27:11.376 --> 27:14.140
they've changed up
to a Jeep and a crossbow.

27:14.212 --> 27:16.680
But the principle
is just the same.

27:16.748 --> 27:19.911
Could a modest 40-miles-per-hour
running start

27:19.985 --> 27:22.783
double the depth of the arrow?

27:22.854 --> 27:26.346
[Laughs]

27:26.425 --> 27:28.791
GRANT: Huh?
We got our own billboard.

27:30.529 --> 27:32.497
Xena, Conan...

27:32.564 --> 27:34.555
Papa Smurf?

27:34.633 --> 27:37.363
NARRATOR: Hopefully,
they've nailed the consistency.

27:37.436 --> 27:39.233
But let's remember
that this myth

27:39.304 --> 27:42.034
rests entirely
on added momentum.

27:42.107 --> 27:44.667
Tory needs to shoot at speed

27:44.743 --> 27:47.644
precisely 60 feet
short of the target.

27:47.713 --> 27:50.648
60 feet.
Right here.

27:50.716 --> 27:52.445
NARRATOR: It's a legend
that's been hotly debated

27:52.517 --> 27:54.382
for 500 years.

27:54.453 --> 27:57.445
So I guess we can hang on
for a few more minutes

27:57.522 --> 28:01.083
to call it confirmed,
plausible, or busted.

28:04.429 --> 28:06.363
[Horns honking]

28:06.431 --> 28:09.400
Back in the 1930s,
there was nothing funnier

28:09.468 --> 28:12.028
than watching
an automobile deconstruct

28:12.104 --> 28:14.197
after a minor collision.

28:17.342 --> 28:18.934
Okay, it's still funny.

28:19.011 --> 28:21.172
I told you not to make
that last payment.

28:21.246 --> 28:24.443
NARRATOR: But these days,
we're less inclined to laugh

28:24.516 --> 28:26.575
at catastrophic car failure.

28:29.654 --> 28:31.884
Adam and Jamie
have gone into meltdown

28:31.957 --> 28:35.859
trying to replicate the myth
of the exploding bumper.

28:35.927 --> 28:37.861
[Snap, hiss]

28:37.929 --> 28:40.523
Jennifer Schmid said the bumper
that broke her leg

28:40.599 --> 28:42.499
traveled just 15 feet.

28:42.567 --> 28:45.900
But the myth we're working with
says 50.

28:45.971 --> 28:47.563
So far, Adam and Jamie

28:47.639 --> 28:50.802
haven't managed to shoot
a bumper 5 inches.

28:50.876 --> 28:52.207
Damn it!

28:52.277 --> 28:54.438
Man, this one
is kicking my butt.

28:54.513 --> 28:56.640
I mean, we are just not seeing

28:56.715 --> 28:58.649
any of
the exploding-bumper action

28:58.717 --> 29:00.378
we're trying to get
out of these shocks.

29:00.452 --> 29:02.317
Well, yeah,
but it kind of makes sense.

29:02.387 --> 29:04.048
I mean,
these things are designed

29:04.122 --> 29:06.522
to not fail catastrophically.

29:06.591 --> 29:08.183
We still have to get that shot.

29:08.260 --> 29:09.693
We still have to see a bumper

29:09.761 --> 29:11.626
shooting 50 feet
through the air.

29:11.696 --> 29:13.027
So how do we get that?

29:13.098 --> 29:15.532
- When in doubt, C-4.
- [Chuckles]

29:15.600 --> 29:18.091
Well, maybe not C-4,
but you get the picture.

29:18.170 --> 29:20.035
[Laughing]
Yeah, I do.

29:20.839 --> 29:24.536
NARRATOR: So now, throwing
caution and custom to the wind,

29:24.609 --> 29:26.509
they're engineering
the spectacle

29:26.578 --> 29:28.307
we've all been begging for.

29:28.380 --> 29:31.907
Jamie cuts two
massively up-scaled pistons,

29:31.983 --> 29:33.848
and the plan here
is to stuff them

29:33.919 --> 29:37.446
with sand, water,
and explosives.

29:38.156 --> 29:40.590
The best venue
in these situations,

29:40.659 --> 29:42.889
as always, is the bomb range.

29:45.831 --> 29:47.662
Like a surgeon.

29:47.732 --> 29:49.393
Nicely done.

29:49.468 --> 29:52.096
We've got one main thing to do
before we run this experiment,

29:52.170 --> 29:56.004
which is attach the bumper
to the car.

29:56.074 --> 29:58.304
It's got a little more support
than your average bumper.

29:58.376 --> 30:01.368
These explosive pistons
are about 14 inches deep,

30:01.446 --> 30:04.176
and I need to hog out
enough of the car's structure

30:04.249 --> 30:07.548
to get this puppy in there
to attach the bumpers.

30:10.088 --> 30:13.717
NARRATOR: Adam enthusiastically
hogs out the front end,

30:13.792 --> 30:18.024
making room for Jamie's
up-scaled hand-built pistons.

30:18.797 --> 30:20.424
ADAM:
I think that's pretty much it.

30:21.466 --> 30:23.627
NARRATOR:
Now for the explosive bit.

30:23.702 --> 30:26.136
To make it happen,
we've re-enlisted the man

30:26.204 --> 30:29.298
who set a similar charge
for "Motorcycle Flip,"

30:29.374 --> 30:31.638
pyrotechnician Matt Heron.

30:31.710 --> 30:32.642
Boom?

30:32.711 --> 30:33.837
Ba-boom.

30:33.912 --> 30:37.245
We're ramping it up, which is
kind of what we do on this show.

30:37.315 --> 30:40.375
So in this case,
what we're doing here

30:40.452 --> 30:42.443
is putting the same amount
of gunpowder

30:42.521 --> 30:45.547
that we used just a little
while ago on "Motorcycle Flip"

30:45.624 --> 30:47.421
to shoot a motorcycle
that weighed,

30:47.492 --> 30:51.656
you know, 250 pounds or so
straight up in the air.

30:54.266 --> 30:56.860
[Laughs]
Well, the timing was perfect.

30:56.935 --> 30:58.197
If you say so, Junior.

30:58.270 --> 30:59.931
[Laughs]

31:00.005 --> 31:01.495
In this case,
all we've got to do

31:01.573 --> 31:05.566
is launch about 50 or 75 pounds
straight that way,

31:05.644 --> 31:07.669
so it's going.

31:07.746 --> 31:08.940
So, what do you think?

31:09.014 --> 31:11.448
Charge in the end,
sand the rest of the way?

31:11.516 --> 31:13.575
Sounds like a plan.
Yeah.

31:14.352 --> 31:16.650
NARRATOR: Adam's plan
is to place a mannequin

31:16.721 --> 31:19.087
exactly 50 feet
in front of the car,

31:19.157 --> 31:21.250
just like the myth says.

31:21.860 --> 31:24.454
[British accent]
Oh, be cooperative, love.

31:24.529 --> 31:25.655
NARRATOR:
For some reason,

31:25.730 --> 31:28.494
he's overcome by an urge
to paint it red.

31:28.567 --> 31:30.831
ADAM: [Normal voice] Well,
that increases its visibility.

31:30.902 --> 31:32.460
NARRATOR:
Meantime, Jamie's focused

31:32.537 --> 31:34.869
on the details
of the detonations.

31:34.940 --> 31:36.999
Now, instead of compressed gas,

31:37.075 --> 31:38.201
we're going to put
some gunpowder

31:38.276 --> 31:40.471
and a bunch of wet sand
in here.

31:40.545 --> 31:41.341
Okay.

31:42.514 --> 31:43.981
JAMIE:
Why the wet sand?

31:44.049 --> 31:46.347
Well, if we just packed
this with gunpowder,

31:46.418 --> 31:47.783
we'd have a pipe bomb.

31:47.852 --> 31:51.686
So the wet sand actually acts
as a shock absorber

31:51.756 --> 31:52.745
for the gunpowder,

31:52.824 --> 31:57.158
and it translates that bang
into forward movement.

31:57.729 --> 32:00.994
NARRATOR: Matt connects both
charges to the same circuit.

32:01.066 --> 32:02.795
HERON:
This is my favorite part.

32:02.867 --> 32:05.927
NARRATOR: So the two shocks
should blow simultaneously.

32:06.538 --> 32:10.406
Jamie lards up the cylinders
to minimize the friction.

32:10.976 --> 32:12.068
JAMIE:
That ought to do it.

32:12.143 --> 32:14.737
NARRATOR:
And the bumper gets refitted...

32:16.081 --> 32:18.072
...nice and tight.

32:18.650 --> 32:20.174
HERON:
That's good right there.

32:20.252 --> 32:21.241
Perfect.

32:21.820 --> 32:23.253
What do you think?

32:23.321 --> 32:24.686
I think we're gonna hit
this guy.

32:24.756 --> 32:26.383
I think this thing's
gonna fly 50 feet.

32:26.458 --> 32:27.948
I have a good feeling.

32:28.026 --> 32:29.960
I think the bumper's
gonna stay still

32:30.028 --> 32:31.461
and the car's gonna go
up the hill.

32:31.529 --> 32:32.894
- You don't really think that.
- No.

32:32.964 --> 32:34.090
Yeah, I didn't think so.

32:34.165 --> 32:36.531
NARRATOR:
So Matt sets the twin fuses.

32:36.601 --> 32:38.728
- We're fully armed?
- We're hot.

32:38.803 --> 32:41.101
NARRATOR: And hopefully,
we're about to get the finish

32:41.172 --> 32:42.662
we've come to expect.

32:42.741 --> 32:45.471
All right,
simulated bumper blast

32:45.543 --> 32:49.639
in 3, 2, 1.

32:50.815 --> 32:51.941
ADAM: Ooh.

32:53.718 --> 32:54.776
Damn.

32:54.853 --> 32:56.480
Wow.

32:56.554 --> 32:59.682
[Laughter]

32:59.758 --> 33:02.056
We may have overdone that.

33:02.494 --> 33:04.985
NARRATOR: "Overdone"
is a word we discourage

33:05.063 --> 33:06.087
here on "Mythbusters."

33:06.164 --> 33:08.029
The trajectory was perfect.

33:08.099 --> 33:10.226
The mannequin's
a shattered wreck,

33:10.302 --> 33:12.793
and, hey, we got
what we came for.

33:13.338 --> 33:15.067
Well, it definitely flew
50 feet.

33:15.140 --> 33:16.630
JAMIE:
[Chuckles]

33:16.708 --> 33:18.471
Oh, look.
It's up there on the hill.

33:18.543 --> 33:19.771
ADAM: Wow.

33:20.345 --> 33:22.472
Looks like we're gonna
have to get another dummy.

33:22.547 --> 33:24.538
ADAM:
[Laughs]

33:25.350 --> 33:27.375
We go through these mannequins
like candy.

33:27.452 --> 33:29.010
[Laughing]
I know.

33:29.087 --> 33:30.748
NARRATOR:
They had to fudge the method,

33:30.822 --> 33:32.585
but now we have an insight

33:32.657 --> 33:37.219
into how unlikely
a 50-foot blast must be.

33:38.096 --> 33:40.291
The bumper
that smashed Jennifer's leg

33:40.365 --> 33:41.332
broke in three

33:41.399 --> 33:45.165
because the two shocks
didn't explode in unison.

33:45.236 --> 33:48.967
We needed Matt's expertise
and two plugs of gunpowder

33:49.040 --> 33:50.337
to make that happen.

33:50.408 --> 33:51.739
Still...

33:53.645 --> 33:55.442
JAMIE: These red stripes
right here...

33:55.513 --> 33:57.413
those are your kneecaps.

33:57.482 --> 33:59.882
Now, granted,
we might have exaggerated

33:59.951 --> 34:00.940
a little bit with this.

34:01.019 --> 34:05.046
But we know that this did happen
with a very similar device

34:05.123 --> 34:06.249
with a car fire.

34:06.324 --> 34:09.760
So if you see a car fire,
you shouldn't stand around it.

34:11.896 --> 34:13.591
You might get hurt.

34:13.665 --> 34:14.632
I'm pretty happy.

34:14.699 --> 34:16.462
We came here
to make a bumper fly 50 feet,

34:16.534 --> 34:18.001
and we totally exceeded that.

34:18.069 --> 34:19.297
It's a good test.

34:22.373 --> 34:24.467
NARRATOR:
Hey, it's a great test.

34:24.542 --> 34:27.375
But simultaneous
catastrophic failure

34:27.445 --> 34:29.139
and a 50-foot launch?

34:29.214 --> 34:31.341
No way in the wide world.

34:31.416 --> 34:33.940
This one's busted.

34:37.389 --> 34:40.222
Grant, Kari, and Tory
are testing the myth

34:40.291 --> 34:42.725
that an arrow fired
from a galloping horse

34:42.793 --> 34:47.094
has twice the penetration
of an arrow fired from rest.

34:48.032 --> 34:51.001
They've had to make
a few adjustments along the way.

34:51.069 --> 34:53.333
GRANT:
Even with trained horses,

34:53.405 --> 34:56.203
they might gallop at
a different speed on each run.

34:56.274 --> 34:58.970
And even with expert archers,

34:59.043 --> 35:01.102
sometimes you might
draw back the bow

35:01.179 --> 35:02.646
just a little bit further.

35:02.714 --> 35:03.976
So what we're doing right now

35:04.048 --> 35:06.039
is getting rid
of all those variables.

35:06.117 --> 35:08.142
NARRATOR:
So the horse becomes a Jeep,

35:08.219 --> 35:11.985
and the medieval bow gets
replaced by a modern crossbow.

35:12.056 --> 35:16.493
The changes are essential for
reliable, repeatable testing.

35:16.561 --> 35:18.290
The first set of data points
we're gonna take

35:18.363 --> 35:19.523
are our static shots.

35:19.597 --> 35:21.861
We're going to shoot a bunch
of arrows into our target.

35:21.933 --> 35:23.798
I'm gonna mark and measure
each one,

35:23.868 --> 35:25.335
and that way we'll have
a great comparison

35:25.403 --> 35:27.428
for when we actually do
our moving shots.

35:27.505 --> 35:30.030
NARRATOR: Tory's ready
to rip through 10 arrows

35:30.108 --> 35:32.702
in quick succession
from a standing start.

35:32.777 --> 35:35.712
TORY:
In 3, 2, 1. Fire.

35:36.581 --> 35:37.878
Fire.

35:40.418 --> 35:41.908
Nice.

35:41.986 --> 35:43.920
TORY:
In 3, 2, 1.

35:44.522 --> 35:46.012
Oh!

35:46.090 --> 35:47.318
Ooh!

35:47.392 --> 35:49.417
NARRATOR:
He is consistent.

35:49.494 --> 35:52.520
But there's an unsettling
pattern developing here.

35:52.597 --> 35:54.963
That was a little too close
for comfort there.

35:55.033 --> 35:56.762
NARRATOR:
Still, nice grouping.

35:56.835 --> 35:59.201
3, 2, 1.

35:59.270 --> 36:02.171
Oh, ho ho!

36:02.240 --> 36:04.367
Right in the ding-dong!

36:04.442 --> 36:05.909
NARRATOR:
Now it's up to Kari

36:05.977 --> 36:08.002
to mark the depth
of each shaft...

36:09.814 --> 36:12.783
That one had to hurt, right
there in the genetic legacy.

36:12.851 --> 36:14.580
Ow.

36:14.652 --> 36:16.813
It's like I was aiming
or something.

36:16.888 --> 36:19.379
NARRATOR:
...then put her back into it.

36:23.361 --> 36:25.124
10 test arrows should give us

36:25.196 --> 36:28.222
a good average static depth
to work from.

36:28.299 --> 36:30.529
KARI: The average
from our static shots

36:30.602 --> 36:32.866
is 8.77 inches of penetration.

36:32.937 --> 36:34.871
So now we're going to take
our moving shots

36:34.939 --> 36:35.963
and compare the two.

36:36.040 --> 36:37.337
Here we go.

36:37.408 --> 36:40.536
NARRATOR: Grant revs the Jeep
like it's a rental...

36:40.612 --> 36:42.671
[Engine revving]

36:42.747 --> 36:44.578
...then gets it up to speed.

36:44.649 --> 36:47.311
Tory steadies, aims...

36:47.385 --> 36:50.354
and makes one tiny mistake.

36:52.824 --> 36:54.382
I got excited!

36:54.459 --> 36:57.690
I got so excited
I forgot to take the safety off.

36:57.762 --> 36:59.957
Okay.
Good practice run, everyone.

37:00.031 --> 37:01.555
This one's for real.
[Laughs]

37:01.633 --> 37:03.066
TORY:
Good time, everyone.

37:03.134 --> 37:06.661
All right.
Hi-ho, Shoot-y! Away!

37:07.205 --> 37:10.766
GRANT: All right.
13, 17...

37:10.842 --> 37:13.777
NARRATOR: Now, let's see if Tory
can keep his composure

37:13.845 --> 37:15.710
and hit the target.

37:15.780 --> 37:19.079
TORY:
Yeah! [Laughs]

37:19.150 --> 37:20.139
Go.

37:21.386 --> 37:22.318
Oh!

37:22.387 --> 37:25.754
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

37:26.991 --> 37:28.424
Yeah!

37:28.493 --> 37:31.428
NARRATOR: The first three shots
found a steady latitude.

37:31.496 --> 37:34.124
One hit the shield,
one hit Tory,

37:34.198 --> 37:36.894
and the last hit Kari
in her favorite kidney.

37:36.968 --> 37:39.596
[Laughs] I keep forgetting
we're trying to get,

37:39.671 --> 37:41.832
like, some actual data
from all this.

37:41.906 --> 37:43.203
GRANT:
Yeah. Oops.

37:43.274 --> 37:45.606
TORY: I thought
we were just having fun.

37:45.677 --> 37:47.338
Yeah, don't forget
to do the science.

37:47.412 --> 37:49.141
[Both laugh]

37:49.213 --> 37:51.511
NARRATOR: Yeah.
Let's not forget the science.

37:51.583 --> 37:54.848
These 10 running shots will bust
or confirm the myth

37:54.919 --> 37:57.888
that arrows shot forwards
at 40 miles per hour

37:57.956 --> 38:01.255
bury themselves twice as deep
in the target.

38:01.326 --> 38:02.793
You're ready to go.

38:08.633 --> 38:11.568
NARRATOR: Tory turns out
to be a natural-born archer.

38:11.636 --> 38:12.967
If shooting a crossbow

38:13.037 --> 38:15.938
from the back of a moving Jeep
was an Olympic sport...

38:17.709 --> 38:20.405
Actually, why isn't it?

38:21.613 --> 38:24.810
- Whoo-hoo!
- Whoo-hoo!

38:24.882 --> 38:27.476
- Oh, I could do this all day!
- GRANT: [Laughs]

38:27.552 --> 38:29.110
I got to remember to stop.

38:29.187 --> 38:30.950
I just want to keep going.

38:31.022 --> 38:32.546
TORY:
This just never gets old.

38:33.124 --> 38:35.456
NARRATOR: But Tory's down
to his last arrow.

38:35.526 --> 38:36.652
Ready when you are.

38:37.228 --> 38:38.217
NARRATOR:
And so far,

38:38.296 --> 38:42.596
barbarian dwarf Grant
is unscathed.

38:47.839 --> 38:49.966
KARI:
Whoo! Yeah!

38:51.309 --> 38:53.504
TORY:
Got the gnome!

38:53.578 --> 38:55.011
You got the dwarf!

38:55.079 --> 38:57.240
TORY:
I got the gnome!

38:57.315 --> 38:58.247
KARI: Yeah!

38:58.316 --> 39:00.307
You got
the little bearded Grant!

39:00.385 --> 39:02.046
Aw, man!

39:02.120 --> 39:04.213
You think you were gonna get out
of this battle unscathed?

39:04.288 --> 39:05.812
I don't think so, friend.

39:05.890 --> 39:07.619
All right.
Now for the fun part!

39:07.692 --> 39:09.421
- Yeah!
- Yeah! Data!

39:09.494 --> 39:12.327
I'm gonna go do math.
Don't be jealous.

39:12.930 --> 39:13.897
NARRATOR: Once more,

39:13.965 --> 39:17.093
Kari marks the shafts exactly
where they pierced the foam.

39:17.168 --> 39:20.729
And they're even harder
to extract than last time.

39:24.942 --> 39:28.503
Well, they feel like
they've gone in further.

39:29.380 --> 39:31.405
NARRATOR:
Now for the tale of the tape,

39:31.482 --> 39:34.679
as Kari measures the penetration
of all 10 arrows

39:34.752 --> 39:37.448
shot from a 40-mile-per-hour
running start.

39:37.522 --> 39:38.989
KARI: The figures
are actually pretty interesting.

39:39.057 --> 39:41.025
We are getting an average
of 11 inches

39:41.092 --> 39:44.459
with all the moving shots,
which is a little over 2 inches

39:44.529 --> 39:46.326
more penetration
than all the static shots.

39:46.397 --> 39:48.262
So we are getting
more penetration,

39:48.332 --> 39:52.792
but it's not the double
that the myth actually claims.

39:52.870 --> 39:54.064
Fire.

39:55.440 --> 39:56.771
NARRATOR:
If it was double,

39:56.841 --> 39:58.809
these arrows
would have buried themselves

39:58.876 --> 40:00.969
all the way
up to their feathers.

40:01.045 --> 40:02.672
Okay, Kari.
So, what do you got?

40:02.747 --> 40:05.682
Well, for the static shots,
I got an average of 8.77.

40:05.750 --> 40:07.081
Now, for the moving shots,

40:07.151 --> 40:09.415
I got an average
of 11.04 inches.

40:09.487 --> 40:11.387
All right, well,
before we call this one busted,

40:11.456 --> 40:13.083
I think we need to go back
to the shop,

40:13.157 --> 40:14.681
double-check the high speed

40:14.759 --> 40:16.249
and see what the speeds
of the arrows were.

40:16.327 --> 40:19.353
[All cheering]

40:19.430 --> 40:21.455
The key to this myth
is penetration.

40:21.532 --> 40:24.126
But after measuring our arrows,
this one's busted.

40:24.202 --> 40:25.464
Yeah, and we used bead foam,

40:25.536 --> 40:27.936
which has a similar density
to both our ballistic material

40:28.005 --> 40:31.338
and the human body, and we
only got 25% more penetration,

40:31.409 --> 40:33.809
which is far from
what their stories told.

40:33.878 --> 40:36.005
And that was backed up
by our high-speed footage,

40:36.080 --> 40:37.843
which showed that our iron horse

40:37.915 --> 40:40.748
increased the speed
of our arrows by 31%,

40:40.818 --> 40:44.549
resulting in only a 72% increase
in kinetic energy.

40:44.622 --> 40:45.611
Not quite double.

40:45.690 --> 40:46.782
Yeah, but you got to give it
to them...

40:46.858 --> 40:49.019
Riding horseback did give them
some advantage.

40:49.093 --> 40:51.857
It just wasn't exactly as much
as they bragged about.

40:51.929 --> 40:53.794
Yeah, but that being said,
the arrows still didn't go

40:53.865 --> 40:55.730
twice as deep,
so this one's busted.

40:55.800 --> 40:56.664
Busted.

40:56.734 --> 40:57.723
Busted.

40:58.305 --> 41:04.377
