00:15.721 --> 00:19.524
9-1-1. What's your emergency?

00:19.558 --> 00:22.127
Hello?

00:22.161 --> 00:23.895
Is anybody there?

00:23.929 --> 00:25.996
Do you need assistance?

00:26.031 --> 00:28.366
Are you in danger?

00:30.469 --> 00:32.503
Castle, what if it rains?

00:32.537 --> 00:33.837
- On our wedding day?
- Mm-hmm.

00:33.872 --> 00:35.373
That's supposed to be good luck.

00:35.407 --> 00:38.042
But we'll find a venue
that has an indoor area,

00:38.076 --> 00:39.076
just in case.

00:39.110 --> 00:40.744
Even if we find the perfect place,

00:40.779 --> 00:43.213
- it's not gonna be available until
at least October. - October!

00:43.247 --> 00:45.348
Harvest season. Perfect.

00:45.383 --> 00:48.085
Perfect, except if you want my dad

00:48.119 --> 00:49.286
to walk me down the aisle.

00:49.320 --> 00:50.688
He's gonna be in Europe
on the research project.

00:50.722 --> 00:52.522
Oh. Fine. We'll have a winter wedding.

00:52.557 --> 00:54.191
Didn't we say
we wanted to do it outside?

00:54.225 --> 00:57.194
- Right. Yeah, frostbite isn't very festive.
- Hmm.

00:57.228 --> 00:59.962
How about we get hitched,
uh, spring of next year?

00:59.997 --> 01:02.632
And what if I wanna
get married sooner? Hmm?

01:02.667 --> 01:04.200
Who could blame you? Mm.

01:04.235 --> 01:06.570
You two are so adorable.

01:06.604 --> 01:08.738
Oh, you know what?

01:08.772 --> 01:11.140
Maybe we could find
a venue for this summer.

01:11.175 --> 01:12.542
You want to have a wedding

01:12.577 --> 01:14.511
in the middle of a New York summer?

01:14.545 --> 01:16.245
No. You're right.

01:16.279 --> 01:17.313
Oh! I know! September!

01:17.347 --> 01:18.848
It's not too hot. It's not too cold.

01:18.882 --> 01:20.282
It's right in the goldilocks zone.

01:20.317 --> 01:22.318
- It's perfect.
- It is, except I'll be out of town

01:22.352 --> 01:23.886
every weekend on my book signing tour.

01:23.921 --> 01:25.121
So unless we get married on a Monday,

01:25.155 --> 01:26.555
September's gonna be tough.

01:26.590 --> 01:29.225
A little unsolicited advice.

01:29.259 --> 01:30.626
Do you give another kind?

01:30.660 --> 01:32.328
In life,

01:32.362 --> 01:37.399
there is no such thing
as a perfect time for anything.

01:37.434 --> 01:39.501
I'm sorry, that's advice how?

01:39.536 --> 01:41.670
Don't wait!

01:41.705 --> 01:43.439
Hell, just go down
to city hall right now.

01:43.473 --> 01:45.807
You love each other.
Stop talking about it.

01:45.842 --> 01:48.076
Just do it.

01:51.247 --> 01:52.814
- We'll find a date. It's gonna be fine.
- Let's keep... yeah, looking.

01:52.849 --> 01:54.082
Okay.

01:54.117 --> 01:55.450
Beckett.

01:55.484 --> 01:58.319
I don't know, Castle.
Maybe we're being too ambitious.

01:58.354 --> 02:00.956
Maybe we should consider
the spring of next year.

02:00.990 --> 02:01.990
I thought you didn't
wanna wait that long.

02:02.024 --> 02:03.925
Nah, I just... I wanna be flexible.

02:03.960 --> 02:05.393
You already are flexible.

02:05.427 --> 02:08.195
You see what I... did there.

02:08.229 --> 02:09.597
What's so funny?

02:09.632 --> 02:10.931
Well, actually, did you know
Beckett can lift her...

02:10.966 --> 02:13.067
- No, nothing. Hello. Nothing.
- I'll tell you later.

02:13.101 --> 02:14.168
- No.
- No.

02:14.202 --> 02:16.170
Well, our victim is a Ted Rollins.

02:16.204 --> 02:17.538
He was shot twice in the chest.

02:17.573 --> 02:18.906
He was 20 years old, lived alone,

02:18.940 --> 02:22.676
and worked part-time
at a secondhand record store.

02:22.710 --> 02:25.746
So how's a 20-year-old who sells
used records for a living

02:25.781 --> 02:27.281
own a place like this?

02:27.315 --> 02:29.349
This is one of the many things
that don't add up here.

02:29.384 --> 02:30.617
Like why he's soaking wet?

02:30.652 --> 02:32.352
The killer left Ted Rollins' body

02:32.387 --> 02:33.620
in the shower.

02:33.655 --> 02:35.389
When the officers arrived,
the water was still going.

02:35.423 --> 02:36.824
And who called them in?

02:36.858 --> 02:37.957
That's a good question.

02:37.992 --> 02:40.460
At 11:50, uniforms responded
to a 9-1-1 call

02:40.495 --> 02:42.496
made from the victim's cell phone.

02:42.530 --> 02:44.831
But the time of death
is between 8:00 and 11:00.

02:44.865 --> 02:47.000
So there's no way
Ted could've placed that call.

02:47.034 --> 02:50.404
So the killer shot him
and then called 9-1-1.

02:50.438 --> 02:53.373
Except our victim was not shot
in this apartment.

02:53.408 --> 02:54.507
How do we know that?

02:54.541 --> 02:56.176
Because he has exit wounds in his back,

02:56.210 --> 02:57.576
but there are no bullets in the bathroom

02:57.611 --> 02:59.779
or anywhere else in the apartment.

02:59.814 --> 03:01.815
Plus lividity indicates
the body was moved.

03:01.849 --> 03:03.817
Okay, so then the killer
put him in the shower

03:03.851 --> 03:05.819
to wash off the trace evidence
from the original crime scene.

03:05.853 --> 03:07.987
And it almost worked except for this.

03:08.022 --> 03:09.923
The grease here
with the tiny red specks?

03:09.957 --> 03:11.290
Water didn't get that out.

03:11.325 --> 03:13.826
It's on his knees and his elbows.

03:13.860 --> 03:15.227
I'm thinking he fell

03:15.261 --> 03:17.095
when he got shot
and landed in that stuff.

03:17.130 --> 03:19.332
Okay, let's get this material to C.S.U.

03:19.366 --> 03:21.834
- See if they can tell us where he was
killed. - I don't get it.

03:21.868 --> 03:23.536
Why would the killer
risk moving the body back here

03:23.570 --> 03:24.804
from the crime scene?

03:24.838 --> 03:25.904
Sounds like a case of

03:25.939 --> 03:28.106
"Weekend at Bernie's" gone wrong.

03:28.141 --> 03:29.241
No. No, wait.

03:29.275 --> 03:30.909
That would have to mean
there's such a thing

03:30.944 --> 03:32.424
as a "Weekend at Bernie's" gone right.

03:32.445 --> 03:33.778
Wait a minute.

03:33.813 --> 03:36.448
These two shoelaces
are tied differently.

03:36.482 --> 03:38.717
That is odd.

03:42.455 --> 03:43.688
This is even more odd.

03:45.924 --> 03:47.759
What are you doing?

03:49.261 --> 03:52.129
Looks like Ted's got
a secret compartment.

03:52.164 --> 03:54.031
And what's a secret compartment...

03:54.066 --> 03:55.600
without a secret?

03:58.738 --> 03:59.971
A laptop.

04:00.005 --> 04:02.740
The key to our mystery
and the identity of our killer

04:02.774 --> 04:04.742
may lie within that device.

04:04.776 --> 04:07.245
Well, if it does, I can't get to it.

04:07.279 --> 04:09.546
Honestly, I've never seen anything
like this before.

04:09.581 --> 04:10.982
So what are we looking at here?

04:11.016 --> 04:12.583
A very high-level encryption program.

04:12.617 --> 04:14.151
What, and you can't crack it?

04:14.186 --> 04:15.953
Come on, genius bar.
I thought you were the best.

04:15.988 --> 04:17.220
I am.

04:17.255 --> 04:20.423
It's just whoever designed this
is... better.

04:20.458 --> 04:22.659
- But give me some time. Let me
see what I can do. - All right.

04:22.694 --> 04:24.661
Anyone else wondering
what a record store clerk

04:24.696 --> 04:26.329
is doing with this kind of technology?

04:26.364 --> 04:28.231
Espo, did you contact next of kin?

04:28.266 --> 04:29.600
Yeah, Ted's father and little brother.

04:29.634 --> 04:30.967
They're on their way down.

04:31.002 --> 04:34.938
I just talked to Ted yesterday.
How could he be gone?

04:34.972 --> 04:37.473
Mr. Rollins, when you spoke
with your son,

04:37.508 --> 04:40.143
did he seem worried
or scared about anything?

04:40.177 --> 04:41.978
He said everything was fine.

04:42.013 --> 04:44.114
Maybe you could help us
with something else.

04:44.148 --> 04:46.849
We found a laptop in one of
the floorboards of Ted's place

04:46.884 --> 04:50.019
with a highly sophisticated
encryption system.

04:50.053 --> 04:51.921
Either one of you know
what it was doing there?

04:53.557 --> 04:55.024
What is it?

04:55.058 --> 04:58.828
Ted was a... computer whiz.

04:58.862 --> 04:59.995
More like a genius.

05:00.030 --> 05:02.865
But it got him into trouble.

05:02.900 --> 05:05.968
When Ted was in high school,
he got into identity theft...

05:06.002 --> 05:08.537
hijacking credit cards, bank accounts,

05:08.571 --> 05:10.205
stuff like that.

05:10.240 --> 05:11.373
Yeah, he'd call it
"pulling a Robin Hood."

05:11.408 --> 05:12.808
'Cause he would steal from the rich

05:12.809 --> 05:14.043
and give to the poor.

05:14.077 --> 05:15.377
The poor being Ted?

05:15.412 --> 05:16.778
He was just a kid.

05:16.813 --> 05:18.580
So how much did he end up stealing?

05:20.016 --> 05:22.351
- $1.4 million.
- Whoa.

05:22.385 --> 05:24.352
But the judge made him give it back.

05:24.386 --> 05:26.354
Part of Ted's plea deal
was that he was barred

05:26.388 --> 05:28.690
from using any devices
connecting him to the Internet.

05:28.724 --> 05:30.358
So he shouldn't have had that laptop.

05:30.392 --> 05:32.661
Is there anything to indicate
that he went back

05:32.695 --> 05:35.997
to committing identity theft?

05:36.031 --> 05:38.767
I was laid off, and...

05:38.801 --> 05:41.635
Ted helped me with Grant's tuition.

05:41.670 --> 05:43.537
I knew he was up to something.

05:43.572 --> 05:46.507
I just didn't wanna believe
he was hacking again.

05:49.011 --> 05:51.346
Okay, so,

05:51.380 --> 05:52.913
let's just say he went back
to stealing identities.

05:52.948 --> 05:55.249
Does that explain why he was killed?

05:55.284 --> 05:56.416
Yeah, people get pissed

05:56.451 --> 05:57.931
about getting their identities stolen,

05:57.953 --> 05:59.787
but normally, they report it
to the police.

05:59.821 --> 06:01.154
Well, maybe he stole
from the kind of people

06:01.189 --> 06:03.156
that <i>don't</i> report to the police.

06:03.191 --> 06:04.558
Hey!

06:04.593 --> 06:06.259
Look who's back from paternity leave.

06:06.294 --> 06:07.928
So how's Sarah Grace?

06:07.963 --> 06:10.263
Oh! Man. I tell you, she is just...

06:10.298 --> 06:13.066
my perfect little angel.

06:13.101 --> 06:16.336
- Oh, she's so cute. Wow.
- Yeah.

06:16.371 --> 06:20.340
Is it me or... or does she...
look a lot like Esposito?

06:20.375 --> 06:21.541
Yeah, she does.

06:21.575 --> 06:22.942
- Wow.
- Really, Beckett?

06:22.977 --> 06:25.278
I expected that from Jackass
but not from you.

06:25.313 --> 06:27.447
Anyway, so I got
that C.S.U. report back.

06:27.482 --> 06:31.017
Looks like Ted might've been
killed in an auto body shop.

06:31.051 --> 06:32.385
Did he even own a car?

06:32.419 --> 06:34.754
No, but they identified
that sludge on Ted's clothes.

06:34.788 --> 06:38.391
It's hydraulic fluid
mixed with red paint flecks.

06:38.425 --> 06:41.193
Now the paint is urethane-based
with high levels

06:41.228 --> 06:44.330
of a volatile organic compound,
so it's most likely

06:44.364 --> 06:46.732
from a car painted prior to the 1990s.

06:46.766 --> 06:48.567
Okay, canvass the auto shops
near Ted's place.

06:48.601 --> 06:50.036
Maybe he was seen at one of them.

06:50.070 --> 06:51.137
- Yeah.
- Hey!

06:51.171 --> 06:53.105
Beckett, we got something.

06:53.140 --> 06:57.510
Now, Ted's laptop is
like Fort Knox on steroids.

06:57.544 --> 07:00.079
But Tory found some unscrambled
artifacts in the registry

07:00.113 --> 07:02.614
to a service set identifier.

07:02.649 --> 07:04.182
I don't know what that means either,

07:04.216 --> 07:06.317
but she got really excited about it.

07:06.352 --> 07:07.653
And here's why.

07:07.687 --> 07:10.355
Yesterday at 7:19 P.M.
Ted connected

07:10.389 --> 07:13.825
to a dedicated server
of a private computer network.

07:13.860 --> 07:16.494
I traced the network. It belongs to...

07:16.529 --> 07:18.063
Universal Banking Solutions.

07:18.097 --> 07:20.398
They're based in Chicago
but have satellite offices

07:20.433 --> 07:23.234
all over the world, including Manhattan,

07:23.269 --> 07:24.735
which is where Ted connected.

07:24.770 --> 07:26.938
Now according to the web site,
"Universal Banking Solutions"

07:26.972 --> 07:28.440
"handles strategic
and tactical procurements"

07:28.474 --> 07:30.141
"for international clients."

07:30.176 --> 07:31.443
And what does that mean?

07:31.477 --> 07:33.844
I... I don't... I was just
reading the screen there.

07:33.879 --> 07:36.614
Okay, so what did Ted do
when he connected to the server?

07:36.648 --> 07:38.482
It's impossible to tell.
He could've sent an e-mail

07:38.516 --> 07:40.484
or accessed the web site.

07:40.518 --> 07:41.852
Or he hacked it.

07:41.887 --> 07:44.288
That, too. Whatever he did,
it was the last time

07:44.322 --> 07:46.356
this laptop was used before he died.

07:46.391 --> 07:48.659
Okay, so, who runs the Manhattan office?

07:51.063 --> 07:53.363
Anderson Cross.

07:53.398 --> 07:54.398
All right, let's see

07:54.432 --> 07:56.366
if Mr. Cross knows what Ted was up to.

07:56.401 --> 07:59.069
I don't know, Castle.
Maybe your mom's right.

07:59.104 --> 08:00.704
I think elopement's a great idea.

08:00.738 --> 08:02.639
There's no planning, no lists.

08:02.673 --> 08:04.274
All we do is we just get married.

08:04.309 --> 08:06.176
Beckett, I promise you,
there is a perfect date

08:06.211 --> 08:08.812
for our perfect wedding,
and we will find it.

08:08.846 --> 08:10.480
- Trust me.
- I do.

08:10.514 --> 08:14.217
- Oh, wedding humor. Nice.
- Mm-hmm.

08:14.251 --> 08:15.551
We need to speak with Anderson Cross.

08:15.586 --> 08:16.653
Let me see if he's available.

08:17.822 --> 08:19.089
- Excuse me.
 - Yeah.

08:19.123 --> 08:20.924
Castle.

08:20.958 --> 08:23.760
Richard, something
is about to happen.

08:23.794 --> 08:26.462
But you cannot react.

08:26.497 --> 08:28.097
I'm sorry. Who is this?

08:28.132 --> 08:32.001
Lives are at stake. Don't react.

08:33.903 --> 08:36.272
Sorry, Mr. Cross isn't picking up.

08:36.306 --> 08:37.873
Oh. Here he is.

08:37.907 --> 08:41.076
Mr. Cross, these people
are here to see you.

08:41.111 --> 08:43.345
Hello there.

08:43.379 --> 08:44.446
I'm Anderson Cross.

08:44.480 --> 08:45.580
Hi. I'm detective Kate Beckett.

08:45.615 --> 08:46.815
N.Y.P.D.

08:46.850 --> 08:49.018
Detective Beckett, so nice to meet you.

08:49.052 --> 08:52.121
And, uh, this is Richard Castle.

08:52.155 --> 08:53.522
Sorry. I didn't get the name.

08:53.556 --> 08:56.224
Richard. Richard Castle.

08:56.259 --> 08:58.393
So why don't we go on
into the conference room

08:58.427 --> 09:00.228
where we can talk?

09:00.263 --> 09:01.863
Yes.

09:03.199 --> 09:05.500
Dad?

09:05.535 --> 09:07.536
Not a word.

09:09.705 --> 09:14.705
Castle 6x12 - Deep Cover
Original air date January 13, 2014

09:14.730 --> 09:19.730
Sync and corrections by atrn97g
for www.addic7ed.com

09:21.087 --> 09:22.738
So, I don't mean to rush us,

09:22.766 --> 09:25.042
but I do have an appointment
in a few minutes.

09:25.082 --> 09:27.717
Actually, this won't take
very long, Mr. Cross.

09:27.751 --> 09:30.920
Um, do you know a man named Ted Rollins?

09:30.954 --> 09:34.324
No, I... I don't believe I do. Why?

09:34.358 --> 09:36.225
He was murdered last night.

09:36.259 --> 09:37.593
Oh.

09:37.628 --> 09:39.862
Okay.

09:39.896 --> 09:42.598
I'm not sure what
that has to do with me.

09:42.633 --> 09:44.333
Well, we believe that he tried
to access your network

09:44.367 --> 09:46.002
yesterday evening around 7:19.

09:46.036 --> 09:48.470
Do you have any idea
why he would do that?

09:48.505 --> 09:51.707
Well, as a matter of fact,
I just got a report

09:51.742 --> 09:53.108
from my I.T. people

09:53.143 --> 09:56.478
saying that someone
tried to hack into our system

09:56.513 --> 09:58.147
around about that time.

09:58.181 --> 10:01.150
And what exactly does your company do?

10:01.184 --> 10:04.753
Well, we basically handle,
uh, multi-million dollar

10:04.787 --> 10:07.156
currency transactions for banks,

10:07.190 --> 10:11.126
international businesses, uh,
foreign countries and the like.

10:11.160 --> 10:14.529
Maybe Ted was trying to, uh...
tap in and steal

10:14.563 --> 10:16.264
from one of those transactions.

10:16.298 --> 10:17.632
Well, if he did...

10:17.667 --> 10:19.834
he was quite unsuccessful.

10:19.869 --> 10:23.038
Has anyone tried to hack into
your company's network before?

10:23.072 --> 10:27.041
Oh, yes. But we have quite
a robust firewall system.

10:27.075 --> 10:28.509
It's never been breached.

10:28.544 --> 10:30.145
Um, well, would you mind
giving me copies

10:30.179 --> 10:31.412
of your incursion reports
along with the ones

10:31.446 --> 10:33.147
from last night?

10:33.182 --> 10:35.082
Of course. I'll send them right over
to you.

10:35.116 --> 10:36.636
Okay, thank you. Thanks for your time.

10:39.488 --> 10:41.522
I'm sorry, Mr. Cross, uh,

10:41.557 --> 10:44.124
have we ever met before?

10:44.159 --> 10:45.726
I don't believe we have.

10:45.760 --> 10:47.527
Really? Because you just
seem so familiar.

10:47.562 --> 10:49.196
Really?

10:49.230 --> 10:51.398
- Uh-huh.
- I have one of those faces.

10:51.432 --> 10:52.499
Huh?

10:55.503 --> 10:57.504
Um, Lanie's got something
for us. We should go.

10:57.538 --> 10:58.838
- Great.
- Thank you.

10:58.872 --> 11:00.674
Not at all. My pleasure.

11:05.179 --> 11:07.914
Okay, so I may know why
one of Ted's shoes

11:07.948 --> 11:09.316
was tied differently.

11:09.350 --> 11:12.185
The killer was looking for something.

11:12.220 --> 11:13.420
In his shoes?

11:13.454 --> 11:15.221
Yep. At the time of his death,

11:15.255 --> 11:18.191
Ted had a coin in his right sock.

11:18.225 --> 11:19.992
Due to rigor mortis,
an impression remained,

11:20.027 --> 11:22.829
including these faint markings.
You see that?

11:22.863 --> 11:24.897
Yeah. Wow.

11:26.734 --> 11:28.768
Hey, Castle.

11:28.802 --> 11:30.203
You with us?

11:30.237 --> 11:31.870
Yeah. Yeah, of course.

11:31.904 --> 11:33.706
Uh... let me get this straight.

11:33.740 --> 11:36.675
So, after Ted was shot,
the killer took off the shoe

11:36.710 --> 11:37.910
and the sock, grabbed the coin

11:37.944 --> 11:40.011
and then put the shoe and sock back on?

11:40.046 --> 11:41.213
Must've been a valuable coin.

11:41.248 --> 11:44.416
Actually, it wasn't.
I did some enhancement.

11:44.451 --> 11:46.619
And based on the coin's diameter

11:46.653 --> 11:47.886
and the markings,

11:47.920 --> 11:50.521
we've identified it as an Iranian rial,

11:50.556 --> 11:52.257
worth less than a penny.

11:52.291 --> 11:55.060
Wow, an Iranian rial, huh?

11:55.094 --> 11:56.694
Castle?

11:56.729 --> 11:59.030
No... theories on international intrigue

11:59.065 --> 12:01.233
or covert espionage?

12:01.267 --> 12:02.667
We really don't have the information

12:02.668 --> 12:05.970
to speculate at this point.

12:06.004 --> 12:07.305
Okay.

12:07.339 --> 12:09.641
Were you able to narrow down
where Ted was killed?

12:09.675 --> 12:11.976
No, but I did check
his stomach contents.

12:12.010 --> 12:14.679
And I can tell you this...
approximately 15 minutes

12:14.713 --> 12:18.816
before his death,
Ted ate clams and funnel cake.

12:18.850 --> 12:20.585
Can you believe that?

12:20.619 --> 12:21.852
Ugh.

12:21.887 --> 12:24.088
Lanie, you slice open
dead people for a living

12:24.122 --> 12:25.756
and you're grossed out by that?

12:25.791 --> 12:27.291
Even I have my limits.

12:27.325 --> 12:29.526
Okay, fine, uh, clams and funnel cake.

12:29.560 --> 12:32.029
That sounds like he had
amusement park food.

12:32.063 --> 12:36.000
Right, and the hydraulic fluid
and red paint on Ted's clothes?

12:36.034 --> 12:37.967
He was at an amusement park,
and I can tell you which one.

12:38.002 --> 12:39.035
How?

12:39.069 --> 12:41.471
Well, as a connoisseur of carny food,

12:41.506 --> 12:43.173
there's only one amusement park

12:43.207 --> 12:45.008
that has both fried clams
and funnel cake,

12:45.042 --> 12:46.176
and that park is...

12:46.210 --> 12:47.577
- Coney Island.
- Coney Island.

12:47.612 --> 12:49.613
Okay, you two creep me out

12:49.647 --> 12:52.582
When you do that shared brain thing.

12:52.617 --> 12:54.750
Uh, I...

12:54.785 --> 12:58.922
Hey, I... I forgot I had to...
drop by my publisher's.

12:58.956 --> 13:00.957
We gotta look at the... galleys.

13:00.991 --> 13:02.792
There's another... uh,
for the Derrick Storm... novels.

13:02.827 --> 13:06.462
There's the galley, and, uh...

13:06.496 --> 13:08.216
Great. Thanks. Hey, Beckett!

13:08.232 --> 13:09.799
The head of Coney Island's
maintenance staff

13:09.834 --> 13:12.768
said that the only place
there would be hydraulic fluid

13:12.803 --> 13:15.838
and paint is the repair facility
under the roller coaster.

13:15.872 --> 13:18.106
Okay, let's have park security
check it out for us.

13:18.141 --> 13:19.308
They have.

13:19.343 --> 13:21.210
And they found blood.

13:36.592 --> 13:40.028
Well, this is definitely
where Ted was killed.

13:40.063 --> 13:42.364
Why here? What was he up to?

13:42.398 --> 13:45.633
Yo, funnel cake
vendor remembered seeing Ted.

13:45.668 --> 13:48.069
Said he got his food
and walked in this direction.

13:48.103 --> 13:49.237
Was he with anyone?

13:49.271 --> 13:50.638
- Not that he saw.
- Killer must've followed him.

13:50.673 --> 13:51.806
Or maybe they came here to meet.

13:51.841 --> 13:53.408
Yeah, why wouldn't the killer
leave the body here?

13:53.442 --> 13:55.243
Why would he drag it
all the way back to Manhattan

13:55.277 --> 13:56.344
to the victim's own apartment?

13:56.379 --> 13:57.879
To throw us off his trail.

13:57.913 --> 14:02.649
Or maybe the killer didn't
want us to find the crime scene

14:02.684 --> 14:06.053
because there's something here
that ties him to the murder.

14:06.088 --> 14:07.821
Do they have security cameras here?

14:07.856 --> 14:09.723
Just that one covering
the south entrance.

14:09.758 --> 14:11.458
Okay, let's talk to park security.

14:11.493 --> 14:13.660
Get them to give us
the surveillance footage.

14:23.971 --> 14:25.506
Oh.

14:25.540 --> 14:26.840
There you go.

14:26.875 --> 14:28.542
- God bless you, man.
- Yeah.

14:33.847 --> 14:36.482
Sit behind me.

14:41.022 --> 14:42.302
Never thought I'd see you again.

14:42.323 --> 14:44.190
Ted Rollins.

14:44.225 --> 14:46.826
Your victim. What have you learned?

14:46.860 --> 14:48.861
What have I le...

14:48.896 --> 14:52.598
I'm sorry, until a year ago,
I had no idea who you were,

14:52.633 --> 14:54.934
and now you come out of the blue

14:54.968 --> 14:56.636
and the only thing you have to say is,

14:56.670 --> 14:58.604
"what have you learned?"

14:58.639 --> 15:01.441
How about a, "hello, son. How you been?"

15:01.475 --> 15:04.143
You're getting emotional.
Now is not the time.

15:04.177 --> 15:05.244
Really?

15:05.278 --> 15:06.745
'Cause it's been about 40 years.

15:06.779 --> 15:08.280
So when would be a good time?

15:08.315 --> 15:10.049
With what I do? Never.

15:10.083 --> 15:12.117
Or did you forget
what happened in Paris?

15:12.152 --> 15:14.186
No. How could I forget?

15:14.220 --> 15:17.056
Then stop acting like you did.

15:17.090 --> 15:18.790
You know what I do. You know who I am.

15:18.825 --> 15:21.393
I let my guard down, people die.

15:21.428 --> 15:22.961
People like Ted?

15:22.995 --> 15:26.397
So who was he really? Who killed him?

15:26.432 --> 15:30.335
You need to tell me what you know.

15:30.369 --> 15:32.604
You don't trust me.

15:32.638 --> 15:34.940
Trust kills faster than bullets.

15:34.974 --> 15:37.075
Look, there's a storm coming.

15:37.109 --> 15:40.744
And if I don't stop it,
a lot more people are gonna die.

15:40.779 --> 15:44.382
Just tell me what you know.

15:44.416 --> 15:46.884
Um...

15:46.918 --> 15:49.320
he was shot at Coney Island
under the roller coaster.

15:49.355 --> 15:51.789
There was a coin in his sock.

15:51.823 --> 15:53.124
An Iranian rial.

15:53.158 --> 15:54.492
Do you have the coin?

15:54.526 --> 15:55.993
No, the killer took it.

15:56.027 --> 15:57.595
Why would he do that?
What does that mean?

15:57.629 --> 15:58.929
It means I gotta go.

15:58.964 --> 16:00.831
If there's any update, text me.

16:00.866 --> 16:02.132
Say you need to meet,
and I'll be back here

16:02.166 --> 16:03.433
within 30 minutes.

16:03.468 --> 16:07.204
Don't tell anyone about this, about me.

16:07.238 --> 16:08.772
Not even your fiancée.

16:08.807 --> 16:11.208
How'd you know we were engaged?

16:11.242 --> 16:13.443
Well, I may not be good at it,

16:13.478 --> 16:15.278
but I am still your father.

16:15.313 --> 16:17.514
Now keep your mouth shut.

16:17.548 --> 16:20.117
And let's try not to get us both killed.

16:31.896 --> 16:33.229
What's wrong?

16:33.263 --> 16:35.532
You don't like the artwork
for your graphic novel?

16:35.566 --> 16:38.367
Oh, no, no, it's great.
It's good, it's, um...

16:38.402 --> 16:40.603
So we were right
about Coney Island, huh?

16:40.638 --> 16:41.905
Yes. One mystery solved.

16:41.939 --> 16:43.606
Only it's led us to a few new ones.

16:43.641 --> 16:45.908
Like what was Ted
doing there in the first place?

16:45.942 --> 16:49.311
- Yeah. It's weird.
- It's more than weird.

16:49.346 --> 16:51.680
Something bigger's going on
here, don't you think?

16:53.316 --> 16:54.483
Hey, guys.

16:54.518 --> 16:55.784
Come check this out.

16:55.818 --> 16:58.287
This is surveillance
from that security camera

16:58.321 --> 17:00.956
at the entrance of
the roller coaster repair yard.

17:00.990 --> 17:03.725
Ted enters alone at 8:47 P.M.

17:03.760 --> 17:05.326
Did anyone enter prior to that?

17:05.361 --> 17:09.431
No. But about 15 minutes later
at 9:04 P.M., someone does.

17:11.601 --> 17:12.768
Wait. Zoom in and freeze it.

17:15.738 --> 17:17.573
That's Anderson Cross.

17:17.607 --> 17:21.443
Oh, my God. He's our killer.

17:29.392 --> 17:31.985
This whole time it was Anderson Cross.

17:32.024 --> 17:33.625
So Ted must've hacked into his system,

17:33.659 --> 17:35.860
and he decided to take matters
into his own hands.

17:35.895 --> 17:39.196
But that doesn't seem likely.

17:39.231 --> 17:43.001
I mean, he really doesn't seem the type.

17:43.035 --> 17:44.835
Castle, what are you talking about?

17:44.869 --> 17:46.770
He lied to us.
He told us he didn't know Ted,

17:46.804 --> 17:47.905
and there he is at the crime scene.

17:47.939 --> 17:50.007
We don't actually see him commit murder.

17:50.042 --> 17:51.842
There's a number
of entrances to that area,

17:51.876 --> 17:53.010
but there's only one camera.

17:53.045 --> 17:54.611
It just... may not be what it seems.

17:54.646 --> 17:56.280
So, what? He just happened to be there

17:56.314 --> 17:57.981
two hours after Ted hacked his company?

17:58.016 --> 18:04.888
I'm... just saying that
Anderson Cross is the killer?

18:04.923 --> 18:07.290
It's just the obvious choice.

18:07.324 --> 18:08.604
Well, that's usually what happens

18:08.626 --> 18:10.027
when all the evidence
points to a suspect.

18:10.061 --> 18:11.221
We have to get him down here.

18:11.228 --> 18:12.596
Pull up everything you can
on his company.

18:16.767 --> 18:18.768
- This makes no sense.
- What?

18:18.802 --> 18:21.104
It's gone. The site disappeared.

18:21.138 --> 18:23.106
Actually, not just the site.
Every trace of the company.

18:23.140 --> 18:26.809
Find Anderson Cross now.

18:26.843 --> 18:28.344
Who the hell is this guy?

18:28.379 --> 18:29.979
He's obviously not a banker.

18:33.349 --> 18:34.884
I know why he looks familiar.

18:34.918 --> 18:36.953
- Where you going?
- To check something.

18:40.223 --> 18:41.356
Pick up, pick up.

18:41.391 --> 18:43.092
<i>Leave a message.</i>

18:47.497 --> 18:48.598
- Hey, Castle.
- Jeez!

18:48.632 --> 18:50.199
Damn, bro. Why you so jumpy?

18:50.233 --> 18:51.900
I'm... dude, I'm not. I'm just...

18:51.934 --> 18:52.934
Well, you will be
once you hear what we've found.

18:52.969 --> 18:54.903
Come on.

18:57.006 --> 18:58.607
So, this guy, Anderson Cross,

18:58.641 --> 19:00.976
is like a villain in one of your books.

19:01.010 --> 19:02.444
His office was cleared out
like he knew we were coming.

19:02.479 --> 19:04.379
- There wasn't a trace of him?
- Nothin'.

19:04.414 --> 19:05.514
Even his receptionist.

19:05.548 --> 19:06.881
She was hired from a temp agency.

19:06.916 --> 19:09.150
Just started working yesterday.
She doesn't know jack.

19:09.184 --> 19:10.652
Neither did the building manager.

19:10.686 --> 19:12.988
He said that Cross rented
the place from him last month,

19:13.022 --> 19:15.090
paid for a year's lease
with a cashier's check.

19:15.124 --> 19:16.457
So it's totally untraceable.

19:16.492 --> 19:18.392
Yeah, whoever this guy is,
he's in a different league.

19:18.427 --> 19:21.562
And we've crossed paths before.

19:21.597 --> 19:23.097
What do you mean?

19:23.132 --> 19:24.732
Check this out.

19:24.766 --> 19:26.834
Remember this guy?

19:26.868 --> 19:28.736
Alexis's kidnapping last year.

19:28.770 --> 19:29.903
Damn, that's right. Uh...

19:29.938 --> 19:31.372
witnesses kept seeing him pop up

19:31.406 --> 19:33.207
at locations
associated with her abduction.

19:33.242 --> 19:34.408
And at each one of those locations,

19:34.443 --> 19:35.709
there was a dead body.

19:35.744 --> 19:37.545
So I sent the video surveillance
to a friend of mine

19:37.579 --> 19:38.779
in the A.G.'s office, and he got a hit.

19:38.813 --> 19:40.213
Now he couldn't get into details,

19:40.248 --> 19:43.350
but he did say that this guy
is a former C.I.A. operative.

19:43.384 --> 19:45.019
Wait a minute. Former?

19:45.053 --> 19:46.553
Yeah, he, uh, he was disowned

19:46.587 --> 19:48.221
for an unauthorized assassination.

19:48.256 --> 19:50.390
He was sentenced to life, broke out,

19:50.424 --> 19:52.793
killed three guards in the process.

19:52.827 --> 19:54.962
This guy's wanted by our government.

19:54.996 --> 19:56.329
Now my friend said that the rumor is,

19:56.364 --> 19:58.965
he's working as a hit man.
And if we get eyes on him,

19:58.999 --> 20:00.367
the A.G.'s office wants us to call them

20:00.401 --> 20:01.722
so they can send in a strike team.

20:01.735 --> 20:04.538
Why would a guy like this
wanna kill Ted Rollins?

20:04.572 --> 20:06.439
More than that, how are we gonna
find a former spy?

20:06.474 --> 20:08.875
He's spent a lifetime
covering his tracks.

20:08.909 --> 20:11.645
Yeah, but Ted hasn't.

20:11.679 --> 20:13.146
And somehow they're connected.

20:13.180 --> 20:15.948
So, we should see
if Hansel left any breadcrumbs

20:15.983 --> 20:17.583
towards our suspect.

20:17.617 --> 20:20.419
We need to retrace every one
of Ted's footsteps.

20:20.453 --> 20:22.421
Our killer knew him well enough
to know where he lived.

20:22.455 --> 20:26.225
- I mean, they had to have had
previous contact. - Okay.

20:27.661 --> 20:30.162
Castle, did you ever
see this man in Paris?

20:30.197 --> 20:31.597
Not that I can remember.

20:31.631 --> 20:34.099
Why don't you, um,
text me those sketches?

20:34.133 --> 20:37.169
I'll have, uh, Alexis come over.
See if she recognizes him.

20:37.204 --> 20:38.237
Do you want me to come along?

20:38.271 --> 20:41.139
Uh, no. No, no. That's... I'll call you.

20:41.174 --> 20:42.308
You okay?

20:42.342 --> 20:45.276
Yeah.

21:02.361 --> 21:04.629
So I'm coming up with
a whole bunch of nothing. You?

21:04.663 --> 21:05.730
Check it out.

21:05.764 --> 21:07.298
It's a printout of Ted's metrocard.

21:07.333 --> 21:09.200
Look how he got
to Coney Island yesterday.

21:09.235 --> 21:10.801
He swiped his card

21:10.836 --> 21:13.070
at the 33rd and Park Avenue
South station.

21:13.105 --> 21:15.206
Probably took the 6 to the N train. So?

21:15.241 --> 21:17.609
So look at his swipes
for the past two weeks.

21:18.977 --> 21:22.012
He kept going back and forth
to that subway stop

21:22.047 --> 21:23.214
at 33rd and Park.

21:23.248 --> 21:25.216
Exactly. And he didn't work,
live, or know anyone

21:25.250 --> 21:26.817
in that area.

21:26.852 --> 21:30.187
- All right. Let's get up there and
see what he was doing. - All right.

21:38.596 --> 21:41.064
Oh! Richard, you're home early.

21:41.098 --> 21:43.032
Care for a glass of liquefied heaven?

21:43.067 --> 21:45.101
Good for your hair, good for your te...

21:47.872 --> 21:50.574
Richard, what is it?

21:50.608 --> 21:53.843
Of course, I believed him,
because he's my father.

21:53.878 --> 21:57.280
Well, especially after Paris.
I mean, why wouldn't you?

21:57.314 --> 22:00.483
But he used me... to stay
ahead of the investigation,

22:00.517 --> 22:02.285
to know when to make a run for it.

22:02.319 --> 22:03.452
If he's innocent,

22:03.487 --> 22:05.255
why didn't he show up at the park?

22:05.289 --> 22:07.356
Richard, look...

22:07.391 --> 22:09.992
the only thing we really know about him

22:10.026 --> 22:11.761
is that we don't know him.

22:11.795 --> 22:16.365
Me? I had one night with him.
You? A day in Paris.

22:16.400 --> 22:19.234
Lean on the people you trust.

22:19.269 --> 22:20.836
Call Katherine.

22:20.870 --> 22:23.506
Tell her what's going on.

22:25.175 --> 22:27.676
I'll get that.

22:27.710 --> 22:29.243
And what if he's telling the truth?

22:29.278 --> 22:30.578
What if he isn't?

22:35.451 --> 22:37.385
Hello, Martha.

22:37.420 --> 22:39.688
It's been a while, huh?

22:39.722 --> 22:42.890
What the hell are you doing here?

22:44.042 --> 22:45.708
Sorry to miss our meeting,

22:45.742 --> 22:48.978
but, uh, I was a little busy
getting shot.

22:50.132 --> 22:53.701
Oh, my God! Come in.

23:02.561 --> 23:04.780
You look good.

23:04.835 --> 23:06.969
Yeah, well, you've looked better.

23:08.650 --> 23:09.717
Oh!

23:09.751 --> 23:10.785
Sorry.

23:12.487 --> 23:14.788
Okay, I boiled everything
just like you said.

23:16.057 --> 23:18.425
But I have to warn you,
my only other experience

23:18.459 --> 23:20.294
with surgery involved a board game

23:20.328 --> 23:23.030
and a guy whose nose
lit up when I made a mistake.

23:23.064 --> 23:24.364
Did you bring the booze?

23:24.399 --> 23:25.765
Yeah. No, right here.

23:25.800 --> 23:26.967
You want something to dull the pain?

23:27.001 --> 23:28.481
No, I want you to steady your nerves.

23:28.502 --> 23:29.937
Take a swig.

23:29.971 --> 23:32.405
Good idea.

23:32.440 --> 23:35.575
Okay.

23:36.944 --> 23:40.547
Okay, now, make an incision
through the wound

23:40.581 --> 23:41.648
about an inch long.

23:41.682 --> 23:42.882
Here you go.

23:42.917 --> 23:44.684
Okay.

23:44.718 --> 23:45.819
About an inch.

23:50.157 --> 23:51.991
- Okay.
- Oh.

23:52.025 --> 23:53.993
All right, now here comes the fun part.

23:54.027 --> 23:58.030
Carefully, and I do mean
carefully, pull the slug out.

24:00.100 --> 24:02.401
But do me a favor.

24:02.436 --> 24:04.603
Try not to make my nose light up, huh?

24:04.637 --> 24:06.538
Right.

24:06.573 --> 24:09.374
Okay.

24:14.380 --> 24:16.515
I think I have it.

24:16.549 --> 24:17.850
I got it.

24:17.884 --> 24:20.518
- Oh!
- I don't got it. Sorry.

24:20.552 --> 24:21.686
Careful, Richard.

24:21.720 --> 24:23.421
Now that you know how not to do it,

24:23.456 --> 24:24.755
let's try the other way.

24:24.790 --> 24:26.191
Yeah, right.

24:26.225 --> 24:29.027
- Okay, let me just get you here.
- Thank you.

24:29.061 --> 24:31.963
Okay.

24:35.868 --> 24:39.637
I think I have it.

24:39.671 --> 24:42.139
All right...

24:42.173 --> 24:43.875
I think I...

24:43.909 --> 24:44.909
- I have it.
- Bravo!

24:44.943 --> 24:46.043
Real good.

24:46.077 --> 24:47.612
- There we go.
- Oh, we go.

24:47.646 --> 24:49.279
Martha, hand me the needle and thread.

24:49.314 --> 24:51.582
Uh... okay, here it is.

24:51.617 --> 24:53.217
And there we go.

24:53.251 --> 24:57.221
All right, you've stitched
yourself up before, I take it?

24:57.255 --> 24:59.323
At least this time I got a needle.

24:59.357 --> 25:02.393
Ah.

25:02.427 --> 25:05.329
So, you wanna tell us how you got shot?

25:05.363 --> 25:07.097
Not particularly.

25:07.132 --> 25:09.133
What about the three guards you murdered

25:09.167 --> 25:11.067
while escaping from prison...
you wanna tell us about them?

25:11.101 --> 25:13.336
Don't believe everything you read.

25:13.370 --> 25:14.671
So you didn't kill 'em?

25:14.705 --> 25:16.840
I work outside the system,

25:16.874 --> 25:19.910
which means I need an effective cover.

25:19.944 --> 25:24.581
Hired assassin, wanted by Uncle Sam...

25:24.615 --> 25:26.615
opens a lot of doors.

25:26.650 --> 25:28.817
Castle?

25:28.852 --> 25:30.053
Crap.

25:31.588 --> 25:33.989
Hey, so I thought I'd see
if Alexis remembers

25:34.024 --> 25:35.958
anything more about the man
from the sketches.

25:35.992 --> 25:39.262
Yeah, about the man
in the sketches, um...

25:39.296 --> 25:42.198
something you should know about him.

25:42.232 --> 25:44.466
What?

25:44.500 --> 25:47.937
He's your future father-in-law.

25:50.740 --> 25:53.776
Nice to see you again, Kate.

25:53.810 --> 25:56.011
Katherine,

25:56.046 --> 25:57.312
I wanna say this isn't
what it looks like,

25:57.346 --> 25:59.981
but it is.

26:01.350 --> 26:03.685
- I was gonna tell you. I swear.
- When?

26:03.719 --> 26:06.354
After you patched him up?
Sent him on his merry way?

26:06.389 --> 26:10.058
He's wanted by the government.
You are harboring a fugitive.

26:10.093 --> 26:11.493
That's just his cover.

26:11.527 --> 26:13.361
And you know that, how?
Because he told you?

26:13.396 --> 26:15.897
Because of Paris.
And because he's my father.

26:15.931 --> 26:17.465
He is not your father.

26:17.499 --> 26:20.068
He made that choice a long time ago.

26:20.102 --> 26:22.369
This man is my suspect.

26:22.404 --> 26:24.739
Now you know what I have to do, right?

26:24.773 --> 26:28.142
Boy, she is a spitfire, this one.

26:29.277 --> 26:31.579
I'm glad we're on the same side.

26:31.614 --> 26:33.147
Who says we're on the same side?

26:33.181 --> 26:35.382
I'm sorry. He wouldn't stay put.

26:35.417 --> 26:38.519
- Richard, I need your laptop. Now.
- Right.

26:38.553 --> 26:40.287
No. The only thing that you are getting

26:40.322 --> 26:41.989
is a ride to my precinct in handcuffs.

26:42.023 --> 26:43.857
You're not gonna arrest me.

26:43.891 --> 26:44.891
Really? Why?

26:44.926 --> 26:46.160
Because you want answers.

26:46.194 --> 26:48.229
And if you take me in,
you're not gonna get any.

26:48.263 --> 26:50.563
The feds will swoop in.
You won't have anything,

26:50.598 --> 26:52.332
and I'll have lost valuable time.

26:52.366 --> 26:55.502
You want Ted's killer? So do I.

26:55.536 --> 26:58.872
There's a hell of a lot
more at stake here than murder.

26:58.906 --> 27:00.707
Then you're gonna have to
tell me what it is.

27:02.309 --> 27:05.378
There was a massive breach at the C.I.A.

27:05.412 --> 27:09.149
Someone hacked the files
containing the identities

27:09.183 --> 27:11.551
of our deep cover operatives.

27:11.585 --> 27:12.752
Do you know who?

27:12.786 --> 27:16.122
No. But it was an inside job
at the highest level.

27:16.157 --> 27:19.292
That's why they called me.
Because I'm outside.

27:19.326 --> 27:22.327
My orders were to find the mole
and recover the files.

27:22.362 --> 27:24.797
What does any of this
have to do with Ted?

27:24.831 --> 27:26.365
Ted was one of my best guys.

27:26.399 --> 27:28.200
I recruited him to help me find Gemini.

27:28.234 --> 27:29.268
Gemini?

27:29.302 --> 27:30.736
Code name for the mole.

27:30.771 --> 27:33.472
He was planning on selling
the D.C.O. lists.

27:33.506 --> 27:35.440
But we couldn't find him.

27:35.475 --> 27:37.576
If these files get out,

27:37.610 --> 27:39.911
the consequences will be very real.

27:39.945 --> 27:42.381
Then yesterday we had a breakthrough.

27:42.415 --> 27:44.883
Ted identified the buyer
and he signaled me to meet

27:44.917 --> 27:46.885
so he could tell me who it was.

27:46.919 --> 27:48.119
But, uh...

27:48.154 --> 27:49.421
But Gemini got there first.

27:49.455 --> 27:50.855
He killed Ted.

27:50.890 --> 27:52.558
Leaving me S.O.L.,

27:52.592 --> 27:56.294
until you told me
about the Iranian rial.

27:56.328 --> 27:58.763
- You... you told him about the rial?
- I...

27:58.798 --> 28:01.432
Ted left that as a fail-safe message...

28:01.466 --> 28:02.667
about the buyer.

28:02.702 --> 28:04.468
Right, it's old school spycraft.

28:04.503 --> 28:07.471
But Gemini knows all the old tricks,

28:07.506 --> 28:10.809
so he took that coin
to throw you off his scent.

28:10.843 --> 28:14.278
Yeah, once I found out
the Iranians were involved,

28:14.313 --> 28:16.814
I traced Ted's trail
back to an apartment

28:16.848 --> 28:19.917
on East 38th street
across from the Iranian mission.

28:19.951 --> 28:22.086
Only Gemini got there ahead of me.

28:22.120 --> 28:23.120
And he ambushed you?

28:23.154 --> 28:25.055
From a rooftop across the way.

28:25.090 --> 28:27.858
Soon as I opened the door,
all hell broke loose.

28:27.892 --> 28:30.027
But...
 I'm good at hell.

28:30.061 --> 28:34.297
I made my way back to the car,
but he was right on my tail.

28:34.332 --> 28:35.866
I had to drive into the East River

28:35.900 --> 28:37.167
just to get away from him.

28:37.202 --> 28:40.437
Look, this is an incredible story,

28:40.471 --> 28:43.040
and I can see
where Castle gets his talent,

28:43.074 --> 28:45.709
but it doesn't mean that
any of what you said is true.

28:45.743 --> 28:46.809
You don't believe me?

28:46.844 --> 28:47.877
Mnh-mnh.

28:47.911 --> 28:49.679
Turn on the news.

28:49.714 --> 28:52.681
<i>A high-speed car chase rocked</i>
<i>the neighborhood of Murray Hill</i>

28:52.716 --> 28:54.250
<i>just hours ago.</i>

28:54.284 --> 28:58.454
<i>According to multiple reports,</i>
<i>the pursuit began with gunshots</i>

28:58.488 --> 29:00.989
<i>at an apartment on East 38th street</i>

29:01.023 --> 29:04.727
<i>where two unidentified men</i>
<i>were involved in a gun battle.</i>

29:04.761 --> 29:06.528
That doesn't prove anything.

29:07.663 --> 29:09.831
Beckett.

29:09.866 --> 29:12.234
So, whatever our boy Ted was into,

29:12.268 --> 29:14.535
it's all some crazy-ass spy stuff.

29:14.570 --> 29:16.171
What makes you say that?

29:16.205 --> 29:19.908
Well, you heard about
that car chase in Murray Hill?

29:19.942 --> 29:22.010
Well, we're at the epicenter.

29:22.044 --> 29:25.079
It's a shot-up apartment
at 38th and 3rd.

29:25.113 --> 29:26.981
It's where it all started.

29:27.015 --> 29:28.249
According to the super,

29:28.284 --> 29:30.184
Ted Rollins rented this place
two weeks ago.

29:30.218 --> 29:32.820
By the looks of the equipment,
he was hacking.

29:32.854 --> 29:34.422
- Hacking who?
- I don't know.

29:34.456 --> 29:37.191
He's got a pretty sophisticated
wi-fi sniffer here.

29:37.225 --> 29:39.294
So, must've been intercepting
Internet traffic from someone.

29:39.328 --> 29:40.895
The Iranian mission

29:40.929 --> 29:42.263
across the street.

29:42.297 --> 29:44.098
What exactly did Ted intercept?

29:44.132 --> 29:45.266
I don't know.

29:45.300 --> 29:47.802
Someone stole the hard drive.

29:50.939 --> 29:52.572
Can I borrow your laptop now?

29:56.377 --> 29:59.313
These are communications
to and from the Iranian mission.

29:59.347 --> 30:00.714
Yep.

30:00.748 --> 30:02.115
That's incredibly illegal.

30:02.149 --> 30:03.183
Yep.

30:03.217 --> 30:05.686
Okay, here. Ted flagged this one.

30:05.720 --> 30:08.522
It's an anonymous e-mail
from Izad Larjani.

30:08.556 --> 30:10.590
He's part of Vevak... Iran's C.I.A.

30:10.625 --> 30:14.961
"F.C. payment received.
Central Library reading room."

30:14.995 --> 30:16.996
- "Tomorrow 5:00 P.M.
- Kingfish."

30:17.031 --> 30:18.464
This was sent yesterday.

30:18.498 --> 30:20.033
Which means it's going down today.

30:20.067 --> 30:22.802
He's sending the D.C.O. list
over a secured wi-fi connection

30:22.837 --> 30:25.805
in... roughly 30 minutes.

30:25.840 --> 30:27.941
Central Library's a perfect location...

30:27.975 --> 30:30.476
It's public. Uh, there's lots
of people on laptops.

30:30.510 --> 30:34.647
Gemini never has to meet
with his buyer face to face.

30:34.681 --> 30:38.651
Wi-fi signals max out
at about 200 feet indoors.

30:38.685 --> 30:39.752
He and the buyer
will have to be in the building

30:39.786 --> 30:40.986
at the same time.

30:41.020 --> 30:42.221
Given everything that's happened,

30:42.255 --> 30:45.057
why would he still
go through with the exchange?

30:45.091 --> 30:46.925
"F.C." means "final communication."

30:46.960 --> 30:48.727
All links have been severed.

30:48.761 --> 30:51.763
If Gemini pulls out,
he has no way to tell his buyer.

30:51.797 --> 30:53.999
He will do anything in his power

30:54.033 --> 30:56.401
to make the transfer.

30:56.435 --> 30:58.203
I gotta go. I gotta stop this.

30:58.238 --> 30:59.404
Well, are you crazy?!

30:59.438 --> 31:00.973
We just pulled a bullet out of you.

31:01.007 --> 31:02.274
Can't you call someone?

31:02.308 --> 31:05.176
This mission does not exist.
I don't exist.

31:05.210 --> 31:06.578
There's no one to call.

31:06.612 --> 31:08.179
Don't you have back-up?

31:08.213 --> 31:11.315
I am the back-up.

31:11.350 --> 31:14.151
- You're in no condition...
- You don't understand!

31:14.186 --> 31:15.987
This list cannot get out into the open.

31:17.189 --> 31:18.790
Then we'll go.

31:18.824 --> 31:22.894
Castle's right. You are in no condition.

31:25.063 --> 31:27.564
And if we stop him,
then we all get what we want.

31:38.667 --> 31:41.508
Let's run this just so we know
we're all on the same page.

31:41.548 --> 31:43.014
Richard, what do you do?

31:43.049 --> 31:45.851
As soon as the Kingfish network
goes online, I log in,

31:45.885 --> 31:47.252
I download the list.

31:47.286 --> 31:49.821
- You don't just log in. You gotta be first.
- Right.

31:49.856 --> 31:50.889
Why does he have to be first?

31:50.923 --> 31:52.057
Because it locks out the Iranians

31:52.091 --> 31:53.191
from downloading the list.

31:53.226 --> 31:54.625
Right. And while Castle's downloading,

31:54.660 --> 31:56.361
I'll track the signal
using the wi-fi analyzer

31:56.395 --> 31:57.562
on my phone.

31:57.596 --> 31:59.364
You could find a spy on your phone?

31:59.398 --> 32:01.932
Mother, there's an app
for everything now.

32:01.967 --> 32:03.434
Now, Kate, remember,

32:03.469 --> 32:05.269
if you don't have a tactical advantage,

32:05.303 --> 32:07.938
just get eyes on him. He's C.I.A.

32:07.973 --> 32:10.140
If you can describe him, I can find him.

32:10.175 --> 32:12.677
Okay. It's almost 5:00. We should go.

32:12.711 --> 32:17.447
Richard, this means a lot, kid.

32:17.482 --> 32:19.616
Thanks.

32:19.650 --> 32:21.418
- Martha, I'm gonna need you...
- I know.

32:21.452 --> 32:24.221
- He's not going anywhere.
 - Okay.

32:27.893 --> 32:29.260
If anything happens to them...

32:29.294 --> 32:30.928
He's a smart kid.

32:30.962 --> 32:32.962
And she's good at what she does.

32:32.997 --> 32:34.230
No, they'll be fine.

32:34.265 --> 32:36.032
I promise.

32:36.066 --> 32:37.200
Forgive me,

32:37.234 --> 32:38.795
but your promises don't mean very much.

32:45.242 --> 32:48.177
Gemini could be any one of these people.

32:53.683 --> 32:54.784
Right.

32:54.818 --> 32:58.454
Scanning for wi-fi signals.

33:01.425 --> 33:02.758
I don't see Kingfish.

33:02.793 --> 33:04.928
Maybe we're too late.

33:09.365 --> 33:13.168
You still play?

33:13.202 --> 33:15.704
No, not so much anymore.

33:15.739 --> 33:17.506
A shame. You were good.

33:17.541 --> 33:19.241
Hmm.

33:21.678 --> 33:23.145
That was hell of a night.

33:23.179 --> 33:25.414
Hell of a night.

33:29.152 --> 33:30.718
You remember the song you played?

33:32.888 --> 33:34.823
"My funny Valentine."

33:34.857 --> 33:39.060
It was a long time ago.

33:40.362 --> 33:42.363
Oh. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Oh.

33:42.397 --> 33:47.301
You need to lie down.

33:47.336 --> 33:51.473
- All right, I am calling an ambulance
for you. - No, no, no.

33:51.507 --> 33:54.943
No, it's just... my blood sugar's low.

33:54.977 --> 33:56.877
You got any juice?

33:56.911 --> 33:59.246
Uh, yes.

34:02.851 --> 34:07.721
5:04. We blew it.

34:07.755 --> 34:11.558
Did we? Or did we just get played?

34:11.592 --> 34:15.195
Look, Castle, I know he's your father.

34:15.228 --> 34:18.831
What if there's an ulterior
motive to all of this?

34:21.603 --> 34:23.704
Kingfish is online. Go.

34:23.737 --> 34:25.338
All right.

34:25.373 --> 34:26.739
Okay.

34:26.774 --> 34:28.408
"T," hashtag, less than, "l."

34:28.442 --> 34:31.277
- Uppercase "L."
- Oh. Capital "L."

34:31.312 --> 34:32.911
We gotta get online
before the buyer. Come on.

34:36.417 --> 34:37.617
I'm in.

34:37.650 --> 34:38.985
Downloading the file
at slowest speed possible.

34:39.020 --> 34:41.554
That gives you less than three minutes.

34:41.588 --> 34:42.621
Okay, you stay here.

34:42.656 --> 34:44.257
You tell me how much time I have.

34:48.929 --> 34:50.129
Can you hear me?

34:50.163 --> 34:51.664
Yeah.

34:51.697 --> 34:54.900
- I can hear you.
- Signal's getting stronger.

34:54.935 --> 34:57.469
You've got 2 minutes, 40 seconds left.

35:00.774 --> 35:02.674
Oh, no.

35:04.411 --> 35:06.412
- You've got under two minutes.
- Okay, Castle,

35:06.446 --> 35:07.979
I'm at the stairs and
the signal's gotten weak again.

35:08.014 --> 35:09.014
Did I pass him?

35:09.049 --> 35:10.382
Wait a minute.

35:10.417 --> 35:14.319
Wait. We are demonstrating
two-dimensional thinking here.

35:14.354 --> 35:17.556
Like Khan in
"Star Trek II: Wrath of Khan."

35:17.590 --> 35:20.859
Khan didn't realize that
the Enterprise was below him.

35:20.893 --> 35:22.326
Right. So if we are the Enterprise,

35:22.361 --> 35:23.461
that means Gemini is...

35:23.495 --> 35:26.229
- Is above us.
- Exactly.

35:27.732 --> 35:30.434
Oh.

35:30.468 --> 35:32.335
Oh, this is so not the time, mother.

35:38.977 --> 35:40.777
A minute 15 left.

35:44.982 --> 35:47.884
Castle, I'm in the book stacks.

35:47.918 --> 35:51.088
I'm close.

35:51.122 --> 35:52.762
All right, less than a minute.
Be careful.

35:59.663 --> 36:01.598
Mom!

36:05.970 --> 36:10.206
Do you see him? Is he there?

36:14.010 --> 36:16.445
Beckett.

36:16.480 --> 36:18.280
Oh, no.

36:18.315 --> 36:19.815
What?

36:19.849 --> 36:21.049
Castle.

36:21.084 --> 36:23.952
He set up some kind of a relay system.

36:23.987 --> 36:26.255
Gemini could be anywhere.

36:26.289 --> 36:28.690
What?!

36:28.725 --> 36:30.859
- Hang on. Something is wrong.
- What?

36:30.893 --> 36:32.728
Well, the download is complete.

36:32.762 --> 36:34.930
But this is... this is not a C.I.A. list.

36:34.964 --> 36:37.298
This is... this is a phone book.

36:37.333 --> 36:40.936
- Richard Castle. Wow.
- Castle...

36:40.970 --> 36:42.104
I'm so sorry to bother you, sir,

36:42.138 --> 36:43.304
but I'm, like, your number one fan.

36:43.339 --> 36:44.806
Can I get an autograph?

36:44.841 --> 36:47.475
Actually, this is really not a good time.

36:47.510 --> 36:49.110
What are you talking about?

36:51.380 --> 36:53.114
Castle?

36:56.352 --> 36:58.686
Castle, are you there?

36:58.720 --> 37:01.122
That was you at the park, wasn't it?

37:01.157 --> 37:03.490
Dressed as a homeless guy?

37:03.525 --> 37:04.859
You're Gemini.

37:04.893 --> 37:06.827
Let's go. Nice and quiet.

37:30.192 --> 37:31.826
Man who sent you... who is he?

37:31.860 --> 37:34.262
Look, I don't know
what you're talking about.

37:34.296 --> 37:37.765
I saw you in the park with him.
Is he C.I.A.?

37:37.799 --> 37:39.600
The phone book.

37:39.634 --> 37:41.001
You knew not to send the real list

37:41.035 --> 37:43.003
because you were trying
to draw him into the open.

37:43.037 --> 37:44.472
That's right.

37:44.506 --> 37:47.140
Looks like he was smart enough
to send someone expendable.

37:47.175 --> 37:49.242
All right, mystery writer.
Tell me a story.

37:49.277 --> 37:50.377
Who's your handler?

37:50.411 --> 37:51.979
What's his name? Where is he?

37:52.013 --> 37:53.146
Why should I tell you?

37:53.181 --> 37:54.915
You're just gonna kill me anyway.

37:54.950 --> 37:57.351
Yeah. But I can slow,
or I can kill you fast.

37:57.385 --> 37:58.518
It's up to you.

38:05.994 --> 38:08.128
Aah!

38:08.162 --> 38:09.396
Aah! Uhh!

38:09.430 --> 38:12.099
Aah.

38:15.736 --> 38:17.136
You all right?

38:17.170 --> 38:19.138
Me? You... you're the one who was shot.

38:19.172 --> 38:20.807
Wasn't the first time.

38:20.841 --> 38:23.275
- I'll go call an ambulance.
- Don't bother.

38:23.310 --> 38:24.744
No! No, no, wait.

38:27.515 --> 38:30.316
Wha... why would you do that?

38:30.350 --> 38:34.086
That was the mission. That's what I do.

38:34.121 --> 38:36.255
H... how did you even find me?

38:36.289 --> 38:37.756
Your left coat pocket.

38:39.259 --> 38:43.162
Wha... what is this?
Some kind of G.P.S. locator?

38:43.196 --> 38:45.731
How did you...

38:45.765 --> 38:47.098
The hug.

38:47.133 --> 38:48.567
You slipped this on me.

38:48.601 --> 38:50.903
I needed to keep tabs on you.

38:50.937 --> 38:52.671
Yeah, to use me as bait.

38:52.705 --> 38:54.840
Well, after the shoot-out
at the apartment,

38:54.874 --> 38:56.008
I knew I was blown.

38:56.042 --> 38:58.043
But I still had to recover this list.

38:58.077 --> 39:00.913
So, to keep the upper hand,
you let Beckett and me

39:00.947 --> 39:03.014
walk into a trap.
We could've been killed.

39:03.049 --> 39:05.950
I would never let anything
happen to you two.

39:05.984 --> 39:08.186
The way you never let anything
happen to Ted?

39:08.220 --> 39:13.425
There are reasons I have
to do what I do, Richard.

39:13.459 --> 39:16.928
- One day you'll understand.
- Hmm?

39:16.962 --> 39:19.063
Now get Beckett. Let her know
we have her killer.

39:29.775 --> 39:32.043
Castle, what happened?

39:32.077 --> 39:34.545
- Come on. Gemini's down here.
 - Okay.

39:39.217 --> 39:41.818
No. No, no, no, no. He was here.

39:41.852 --> 39:43.887
He was here just a minute ago.

39:43.921 --> 39:47.157
Of course he took the body.

39:47.192 --> 39:51.228
Yeah.

39:51.262 --> 39:52.729
But left Gemini's weapon.

39:55.499 --> 39:57.968
That gun was a ballistics match
to the one that killed Ted.

39:58.002 --> 39:59.803
It's registered to...

39:59.837 --> 40:00.971
Tony Blaine.

40:01.005 --> 40:02.606
We searched his place.

40:02.640 --> 40:04.540
Found clothes that tested
positive for Ted's blood.

40:04.575 --> 40:06.810
- Blaine's definitely our killer.
- But who is he?

40:06.844 --> 40:09.112
He's a researcher
at a government think tank.

40:09.146 --> 40:11.814
Yeah, but what a researcher
at a government think tank

40:11.848 --> 40:12.815
is doing involved in all this,
we have no idea.

40:12.849 --> 40:14.484
Yeah, we may never know.

40:14.518 --> 40:16.051
Well, hold on.
We've got a B.O.L.O. out on him

40:16.086 --> 40:17.420
and we're monitoring his credit cards.

40:17.454 --> 40:19.555
- We'll find him.
- And when we do, maybe he can tell us

40:19.590 --> 40:20.756
who this Anderson Cross is.

40:20.790 --> 40:23.692
Yeah, maybe.

40:23.727 --> 40:24.994
All right, great job, guys.

40:25.028 --> 40:26.261
Thanks.

40:30.199 --> 40:32.067
Well, it looks like the C.I.A.
wrapped all this up

40:32.102 --> 40:33.335
in a neat package.

40:33.369 --> 40:36.338
Yeah, with a bow courtesy of my father.

40:36.372 --> 40:38.440
At least Ted's killer
was brought to justice,

40:38.474 --> 40:40.843
you know, in a... in a way.

40:40.877 --> 40:42.710
But Blaine killed Ted

40:42.745 --> 40:44.312
but left his body at Coney Island.

40:44.347 --> 40:46.047
It was my father that moved the body.

40:46.081 --> 40:47.582
Now he could've put it anywhere,

40:47.617 --> 40:48.883
but he took it to Ted's apartment.

40:48.917 --> 40:49.984
Do you know why?

40:52.788 --> 40:54.722
To bring him into our jurisdiction.

40:54.757 --> 40:56.057
He wanted us to catch the case

40:56.091 --> 40:58.626
so he could work me for information.

40:58.661 --> 41:00.161
Well, maybe he was just
looking for a reason

41:00.195 --> 41:04.132
to see you again, and this was his way.

41:04.166 --> 41:07.268
I keep making the mistake
of thinking he's family.

41:07.302 --> 41:09.137
But he's not.

41:11.173 --> 41:12.473
You are.

41:14.409 --> 41:16.210
September.

41:16.244 --> 41:17.844
What?

41:17.879 --> 41:19.746
We're getting married in September.

41:19.781 --> 41:21.848
It won't be too hot.
It won't be too cold.

41:21.883 --> 41:23.917
It's in the goldilocks zone.
It's perfect.

41:23.951 --> 41:25.919
Wait, wait, Castle.
What about your book tour?

41:25.953 --> 41:27.821
Screw it.

41:27.855 --> 41:29.122
September.

41:29.157 --> 41:31.892
Okay.

41:42.170 --> 41:44.437
Hello, mother.

41:44.471 --> 41:45.471
How are you?

41:45.506 --> 41:48.708
Well, that was fun. What a day.

41:48.742 --> 41:51.110
You know, for years
I wondered if your father

41:51.144 --> 41:53.213
was the one who got away.

41:53.247 --> 41:56.482
Well, now, I finally know.

41:56.517 --> 41:57.983
He was never worth your time.

41:58.018 --> 42:01.654
Oh, yes, he was.

42:01.689 --> 42:03.223
First time I met him,

42:03.257 --> 42:06.792
he gave me the greatest gift
of my life... you.

42:06.827 --> 42:10.596
And now after all these years,
he's given me another one.

42:10.630 --> 42:12.732
Closure.

42:12.766 --> 42:16.668
So... what about you, kiddo?

42:16.703 --> 42:18.570
How are you?

42:18.605 --> 42:21.840
I don't know.

42:21.874 --> 42:25.944
Think we'll ever see him again?

42:25.978 --> 42:28.547
I wish I knew.
