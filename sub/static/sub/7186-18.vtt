01:02.695 --> 01:04.430
Ahoy, mateys.

01:04.432 --> 01:07.166
Do you want to join
my pirate crew?

01:08.601 --> 01:09.601
Great.

01:09.603 --> 01:11.270
To start today's adventure,

01:11.272 --> 01:13.806
everybody say
the Pirate Password:

01:13.808 --> 01:15.841
Yo-ho ho.

01:15.843 --> 01:19.111
- [all] Yo-ho ho.
- One more time.

01:19.113 --> 01:21.146
Yo-ho ho.

01:24.284 --> 01:26.718
<i>[Jake]</i> "Hook's Hookity-Hook."

01:26.720 --> 01:30.556
[Smee] Are you sure this
is the right path, Cap'n?

01:30.558 --> 01:32.624
Captain Hook
is always sure.

01:32.626 --> 01:34.693
- And right now I'm sure
- [grunting]

01:34.695 --> 01:37.496
that I feel mud
in me boots.

01:37.498 --> 01:42.334
Mr. Smee, me Whirly-Hook,
if you please.

01:42.336 --> 01:45.637
Now, hold on, lads.

01:45.639 --> 01:48.607
Blasted contraption.

01:48.609 --> 01:51.610
Bones. Fetch me
Grappling-Hook hook.

01:51.612 --> 01:54.780
Uh, your Grappling-Hook hook?

01:54.782 --> 01:57.683
The hook you use
for grappling, and...

01:57.685 --> 01:59.685
You didn't pack it,
did you?

01:59.687 --> 02:03.388
[sighs] How about
the Extendo-Grip Hook?

02:03.390 --> 02:05.591
Way ahead of ya, Cap'n.
[chuckles]

02:05.593 --> 02:08.627
Now, watch carefully
as I grab that branch

02:08.629 --> 02:10.429
and pull us
out of the mud.

02:10.431 --> 02:12.498
[hooting]

02:12.500 --> 02:14.733
Blast.

02:16.669 --> 02:19.171
[Skully] Everyone ready
for a coconut snack?

02:19.173 --> 02:20.873
- Aye-aye.
- Yay-hey.

02:20.875 --> 02:24.643
Aw, coconuts.
There's a map inside.

02:24.645 --> 02:27.279
[gasps] How'd that
get in there?

02:27.281 --> 02:28.881
Hey, check it out.

02:28.883 --> 02:32.317
It's a map to the Golden
Treasure of the Palms.

02:32.319 --> 02:35.487
The treasure's hidden in
the leaves of a palm tree

02:35.489 --> 02:37.689
in the Thousand
Palm Forest.

02:37.691 --> 02:39.925
I sure would like
to see that treasure.

02:39.927 --> 02:41.426
Me, too.

02:41.428 --> 02:43.595
Say, mateys.
Wanna help us find

02:43.597 --> 02:46.231
the Golden Treasure
of the Palms?

02:47.433 --> 02:48.800
Great.

02:48.802 --> 02:50.936
Keep a lookout
for gold doubloons.

02:50.938 --> 02:52.905
Whenever we solve
a Pirate Problem together,

02:52.907 --> 02:55.407
they'll appear.
Then we'll collect 'em

02:55.409 --> 02:57.509
and put 'em in our
Team Treasure Chest.

02:57.511 --> 02:59.611
Is everybody ready?

02:59.613 --> 03:00.746
I got my sword.

03:00.748 --> 03:02.381
I got my map.

03:02.383 --> 03:04.683
And I've got
my Pixie Dust.

03:04.685 --> 03:08.187
The fairies gave it to me
so that we can use it to fly.

03:08.189 --> 03:10.389
But only in emergencies.

03:10.391 --> 03:12.357
Yo-ho, let's go find

03:12.359 --> 03:14.793
the Golden Treasure
of the Palms.

03:17.697 --> 03:20.566

<i>¶ And me </i>

03:34.614 --> 03:37.583

03:37.585 --> 03:39.651
What's the Cap'n
doin' below deck?

03:39.653 --> 03:40.919
[clanking, banging]

03:40.921 --> 03:42.387
Behold.

03:42.389 --> 03:45.424
Me new hook shall
always be the hook I need

03:45.426 --> 03:47.893
for the job at hand,
uh, so to speak.

03:47.895 --> 03:51.530
I give you
the Hookity-Hook.

03:51.532 --> 03:54.666
Me Hookity-Hook is
all of me hooks combined

03:54.668 --> 03:57.669
into one super-hook.

03:57.671 --> 04:00.439
[chuckles] Like one
of them pocket-thingies

04:00.441 --> 04:02.741
with a screwdriver
built right in.

04:02.743 --> 04:05.410
Exactly.

04:05.412 --> 04:07.246
[all gasping]

04:07.248 --> 04:09.448
And it's a Whirly-Hook.

04:09.450 --> 04:11.683
A Frying-Pan-Hook.

04:11.685 --> 04:14.953
Even a Mustache-Comb-Hook.

04:14.955 --> 04:16.722
[all gasping]

04:16.724 --> 04:18.890
With me Hookity-Hook,

04:18.892 --> 04:20.993
I'll always have
the perfect hook

04:20.995 --> 04:22.928
for every situation.

04:22.930 --> 04:27.599
<i>¶ You need the Hookity-Hook</i>
<i>The Hookity-Hook ¶</i>

[muttering]
Oh, shoo, fly.

05:01.802 --> 05:04.536
Allow me.
Or rather...

05:04.538 --> 05:06.805
...allow me Hookity-Hook.

05:07.674 --> 05:09.308
Wha...?
Uh, no. I...

05:09.310 --> 05:10.842
[shouting]

05:12.545 --> 05:16.348
Um, is the Hookity-Hook
supposed to do that, Cap'n?

05:16.350 --> 05:17.816
Of course not.

05:17.818 --> 05:19.584
Something's gone
terribly wrong.

05:24.657 --> 05:27.793
Bon voya-ge.
There it goes.

05:27.795 --> 05:30.329
The Hookity-Hook
with all your hooks.

05:30.331 --> 05:32.731
Well, after it,
you swabs.

05:32.733 --> 05:35.067
Stop that Hookity-Hook!

05:36.903 --> 05:39.504
The Golden Treasure
of the Palms

05:39.506 --> 05:42.808
is somewhere on the other side
of Grandest Canyon.

05:42.810 --> 05:44.543
So, yo-ho.

05:44.545 --> 05:47.879
The only way to go
is across this rope bridge.

05:51.417 --> 05:53.118
Shiver me timbers.

05:53.120 --> 05:54.920
What is that?

05:54.922 --> 05:57.689
It's mine.
Don't touch it!

05:57.691 --> 05:59.491
[all] Captain Hook?

05:59.493 --> 06:01.660
[gasps] Wait, no.
Go back!

06:01.662 --> 06:05.464
Bah! You're not the
puny pirate boss of me.

06:08.101 --> 06:09.835
Uh-oh.

06:09.837 --> 06:11.837
Hang on!

06:11.839 --> 06:14.406
[all shouting]

06:14.408 --> 06:18.610
- Whoo! Is everyone OK?
- [all] Aye.

06:18.612 --> 06:20.579
But we can forget
about crossing

06:20.581 --> 06:22.614
this blasted bridge.

06:22.616 --> 06:24.449
It's OK, Captain Hook.

06:24.451 --> 06:26.084
We don't have
to cross the bridge,

06:26.086 --> 06:29.087
We just have to climb
up it like a ladder.

06:29.089 --> 06:30.889
Carefully.

06:30.891 --> 06:32.724
There, there, Cap'n.

06:32.726 --> 06:35.894
Just one more
itty bitty step.

06:35.896 --> 06:38.029
Oh, stop your fussing, Smee.

06:38.031 --> 06:39.631
All right!

06:39.633 --> 06:42.000
We made it across
Grandest Canyon,

06:42.002 --> 06:44.736
and we got
two gold doubloons.

06:44.738 --> 06:45.971
Let's grab 'em and go.

06:45.973 --> 06:48.073
[Hook] Get me Hookity-Hook.

06:48.075 --> 06:50.609
What kind of hook is that?

06:50.611 --> 06:53.612
<i>¶ You got every hook</i>
<i>you could ever need ¶</i>

06:53.614 --> 06:57.482
<i>¶ With the Hookity-Hook</i>
<i>at the end of your sleeve ¶</i>

06:57.484 --> 07:00.051
Come here,
ye slippery eel.

07:07.527 --> 07:10.829
We'll corner that confounded
contraption in the jungle.

07:10.831 --> 07:12.931
Hookity-Hookity-Ho!

07:15.034 --> 07:18.770
I hope Captain Hook catches
his wacky Hookity-Hook.

07:18.772 --> 07:22.908
[laughs] Now let's find that
Golden Treasure of the Palms.

07:22.910 --> 07:24.676
Whoa. Check it out.

07:24.678 --> 07:27.045
- Up Falls.
- That's good,

07:27.047 --> 07:29.548
'cause the map says
we have to go up.

07:29.550 --> 07:32.050
All we've gotta do
is float into the falls

07:32.052 --> 07:33.952
and they'll lift us
up to the top.

07:33.954 --> 07:36.988
Let's use this log
like a boat.

07:36.990 --> 07:38.824
Hang on, mateys.

07:38.826 --> 07:41.660
[Izzy] Look.
It's the Hookity-Hook.

07:41.662 --> 07:45.664
Hookity-Hook.
Come to papa captain.

07:49.735 --> 07:51.236
Ah, fiddlesticks.

07:51.238 --> 07:52.471
[screaming]

07:52.473 --> 07:53.805
Incoming.

07:53.807 --> 07:55.640
[grunts] Gotcha.

07:55.642 --> 07:56.842
[Hook] Me Hookity-Hook!

07:56.844 --> 07:58.009
You know,
if you'd like some help

07:58.011 --> 07:59.578
catching that Hookity-Hook...

07:59.580 --> 08:01.947
Oh, no, you don't,
you popinjays.

08:01.949 --> 08:05.717
I've had quite enough
of your meddling for one day.

08:05.719 --> 08:08.753
Last stop.
Top of the falls.

08:08.755 --> 08:12.123
Yo-ho, we made it
to the top of Up Falls.

08:12.125 --> 08:15.560
And we got three more
gold doubloons.

08:15.562 --> 08:16.828
Let's grab 'em,

08:16.830 --> 08:19.731
and go find the Golden
Treasure of the Palms.

08:22.802 --> 08:24.035
Whoo-hoo!

08:24.037 --> 08:26.671
That's a lot of palm trees.

08:26.673 --> 08:28.707
That's the Thousand
Palm Forest.

08:28.709 --> 08:30.742
The Golden Treasure
of the Palms

08:30.744 --> 08:32.010
is supposed to be hidden

08:32.012 --> 08:34.613
on top of one
of these palm trees.

08:34.615 --> 08:36.114
Cracker-roo.

08:36.116 --> 08:39.284
Finding the treasure's
not gonna be easy.

08:39.286 --> 08:42.787
Yeah, we can't see
which treetop has
the golden treasure

08:42.789 --> 08:44.789
'cause all the palm leaves
are hanging down.

08:44.791 --> 08:48.927
Hmm. I bet if a really
big wind was blowing,

08:48.929 --> 08:51.296
the palm leaves
might lift up.

08:51.298 --> 08:53.598
And then we could
find the treasure.

08:53.600 --> 08:55.300
Too bad we don't have
a Whirly-Hook

08:55.302 --> 08:56.735
like Captain Hook.

08:56.737 --> 09:00.038
When it spins, it makes
a really big wind.

09:00.040 --> 09:01.573
[boinging]

09:01.575 --> 09:03.775
[all panting]

09:03.777 --> 09:06.311
After it, men.

09:06.313 --> 09:07.679
Captain Hook?

09:07.681 --> 09:10.015
You're still chasing
your Hookity-Hook?

09:10.017 --> 09:12.551
I hate to admit it, boy,

09:12.553 --> 09:16.187
but I've been outsmarted
by me own hook.

09:16.189 --> 09:18.990
We'd be happy to help you
catch your Hookity-Hook.

09:18.992 --> 09:21.326
And once we do,

09:21.328 --> 09:22.894
do you think
we could borrow it

09:22.896 --> 09:25.330
to find the Golden Treasure
of the Palms?

09:25.332 --> 09:27.332
Anything.

09:27.334 --> 09:29.868
Just get me hooks back!

09:29.870 --> 09:31.836
It went this-a-way.

09:31.838 --> 09:33.705
[chuckles]
It's almost like

09:33.707 --> 09:35.707
the Hookity-Hook
is playing with us.

09:37.944 --> 09:40.111
We've gotta keep it
from running away.

09:40.113 --> 09:43.782
I know how.
Pixie Dust away.

09:43.784 --> 09:45.984
[Jake] Way to go, Izzy.

09:45.986 --> 09:47.786
May we use it now,
Captain?

09:47.788 --> 09:51.823
[grumbling] All right,
very well then.

09:52.825 --> 09:55.760
Hookity-Hook,
do your thing.

09:57.997 --> 10:00.999
[Skully] Yo-ho,
thar she blows.

10:01.001 --> 10:02.200
[Cubby] Check it out.

10:02.202 --> 10:05.704
The treasure
is a golden coconut.

10:05.706 --> 10:09.274
That must be the Golden
Treasure of the Palms.

10:09.276 --> 10:13.044
Yay-hey. We found the Golden
Treasure of the Palms,

10:13.046 --> 10:15.880
and we got four more
gold doubloons.

10:15.882 --> 10:18.617
Let's grab 'em and go
take another look

10:18.619 --> 10:21.219
at the awesome
Golden Coconut.

10:22.688 --> 10:25.357
Now that I've got me
Hookity-Hook back,

10:25.359 --> 10:28.727
I wouldn't mind
having a Golden Coconut

10:28.729 --> 10:31.129
to go with it.

10:31.131 --> 10:32.864
No way, Captain Hook.

10:32.866 --> 10:34.866
[grunting]

10:36.035 --> 10:38.837
Blast!
Hookity-Hook.

10:38.839 --> 10:43.842
I am your captain and I
command you to stand down.

10:44.810 --> 10:46.044
Run!

10:46.046 --> 10:49.180
[all chattering]

10:49.182 --> 10:51.282
[Izzy chuckling]
Well, at least Captain Hook

10:51.284 --> 10:53.385
got his Hookity-Hook back.

10:54.920 --> 10:56.121
Thanks for helping us find

10:56.123 --> 10:58.356
the Golden Treasure
of the Palms, mateys.

10:58.358 --> 11:00.392
Now let's put all
our gold doubloons

11:00.394 --> 11:02.394
into our Team
Treasure Chest.

11:09.735 --> 11:11.870
<i>¶ Way, hey</i>
<i>Well done, crew ¶</i>

11:11.872 --> 11:13.938
<i>¶ Everyone knew</i>
<i>just what to do ¶</i>

11:13.940 --> 11:15.974
<i>¶ Way, hey</i>
<i>with help from you ¶</i>

11:15.976 --> 11:18.910
<i>¶ It's time to count</i>
<i>our gold doubloons ¶</i>

11:18.912 --> 11:21.346
Come on, count with us.

11:21.348 --> 11:23.882
[all] Yeah!

11:23.884 --> 11:28.353
[Jake] One, two,
three, four...

11:28.355 --> 11:30.922
[Cubby] Five, six, seven...

11:30.924 --> 11:32.924
[Izzy] Eight, nine.

11:32.926 --> 11:36.361
[Jake] Yo-ho. For solving
Pirate Problems today,

11:36.363 --> 11:39.864
we got nine
gold doubloons.

11:39.866 --> 11:42.233
And that's not all
we got. Look.

11:42.235 --> 11:45.870
Someone made us
fruit smoothies.

11:45.872 --> 11:47.272
[all] Hookity-Hook?

11:47.274 --> 11:49.874
[chuckling]
Thanks, Hookity-Matey.

11:53.713 --> 11:56.715
[Hook] What a miserable day.

11:56.717 --> 11:59.384
Perhaps a little dinner
will cheer me up.

11:59.386 --> 12:01.453
Smee, fetch me a fork-hook,

12:01.455 --> 12:04.155
a spoon-hook,
and a napkin-hook.

12:04.157 --> 12:05.890
Thank you. I...

12:05.892 --> 12:07.892
[gasping, shouting]

12:07.894 --> 12:09.294
Not you.

12:09.296 --> 12:12.430
Smee! Save me.

12:15.968 --> 12:17.769
<i>[Jake]</i> "Hooked Together."

12:17.771 --> 12:20.138
[Hook] Pull, Mr. Smee, pull.

12:20.140 --> 12:22.774
[grunting] Pulling, sir.

12:22.776 --> 12:25.744
At last.
I've done it.

12:25.746 --> 12:27.912
I found a treasure chest.

12:27.914 --> 12:31.449
Now, to open it.

12:31.451 --> 12:34.252
Fie and futility.

12:34.254 --> 12:35.854
Locked tight.

12:35.856 --> 12:37.856
Oh, too bad, Cap'n.

12:37.858 --> 12:39.758
Guess we'll just
have to bury it again,

12:39.760 --> 12:41.793
and let some other pirates
dig it up.

12:41.795 --> 12:44.863
Quiet, Smee.
I hear voices.

12:44.865 --> 12:47.999
[Jake] Heads up, crew.
Never Land ho!

12:48.001 --> 12:50.301
Cubby, where does
the map say

12:50.303 --> 12:52.937
to start our hunt
for the NeverKey?

12:52.939 --> 12:55.340
Hmm. Give me a sec.

12:55.342 --> 13:00.111
[gasps] The puny pirates are
looking for the NeverKey?

13:00.113 --> 13:01.980
I'm in luck.

13:01.982 --> 13:06.551
'Tis said the NeverKey can
open any lock on Never Land.

13:06.553 --> 13:08.787
Including this one.

13:08.789 --> 13:10.488
The way to the NeverKey

13:10.490 --> 13:13.091
starts not far
from here at...

13:13.093 --> 13:15.226
...Ancient Armor Row?

13:15.228 --> 13:18.062
Oh. That's where
the pirate knights of old

13:18.064 --> 13:19.831
left their suits of armor.

13:19.833 --> 13:21.566
Aw, coconuts.

13:21.568 --> 13:23.802
That place is creepy.

13:23.804 --> 13:26.204
Don't worry, Cubby,
we'll be right there with you.

13:26.206 --> 13:29.007
Yo-ho, let's go find
the NeverKey.

13:29.009 --> 13:32.544
I must get
that NeverKey, Smee.

13:32.546 --> 13:36.181
But sir, the sea pups
haven't even found it yet.

13:36.183 --> 13:38.449
If only you had a map.

13:38.451 --> 13:41.853
I know where
Ancient Armor Row is.

13:41.855 --> 13:45.023
We shall arrive
before the puny pirates,

13:45.025 --> 13:49.994
take their map and find
the NeverKey before they do.

13:51.931 --> 13:55.200
[Hook chuckling]
My idea to hide inside

13:55.202 --> 13:58.369
these old suits of armor
is genius.

13:58.371 --> 14:01.539
I'm not so sure, Cap'n.

14:01.541 --> 14:03.908
My armor suit is cramped.

14:03.910 --> 14:07.011
Here we are, mateys.
Ancient Armor Row.

14:07.013 --> 14:08.479
I can hardly move.

14:08.481 --> 14:12.283
Shh! The popinjays approach.

14:12.285 --> 14:16.120
[stammering]
See what I mean? Creepy.

14:16.122 --> 14:20.391
Oh, they're just rusty
old piles of empty metal.

14:20.393 --> 14:21.593
Nothing to worry about.

14:21.595 --> 14:24.429
You're right, Jake.
I'm bein' silly.

14:24.431 --> 14:29.334
[nervous chuckle]
The NeverKey is this way.

14:29.336 --> 14:32.871
Me plan is working.
Grab that map.

14:32.873 --> 14:35.273
- [Smee] Oh, dear.
- Crackers.

14:35.275 --> 14:37.475
That armor's movin'.

14:37.477 --> 14:39.177
Whoa!

14:39.179 --> 14:41.012
[all] Jake!

14:41.014 --> 14:43.581
Whew!
I'm shipshape, mateys.

14:43.583 --> 14:44.883
Not a scratch.

14:44.885 --> 14:46.184
[groaning]

14:46.186 --> 14:47.986
[all] Captain Hook?

14:47.988 --> 14:50.622
Me in the flesh,
popinjay...

14:50.624 --> 14:52.657
What in plunder?
Smee.

14:52.659 --> 14:56.227
Get me out of
these manacles.

14:56.229 --> 14:58.029
Hey. I'm stuck, too.

14:58.031 --> 14:59.898
This thing is locked tight.

14:59.900 --> 15:01.499
Shiver me timbers.

15:01.501 --> 15:05.937
I don't see a key to those
rusty old manacles anywhere.

15:05.939 --> 15:08.606
You mean, I
and this puny pirate

15:08.608 --> 15:11.442
are locked together?
Forever?

15:11.444 --> 15:13.678
[chuckling]
Relax, Captain Hook.

15:13.680 --> 15:16.281
I know a key that'll
open these old locks.

15:16.283 --> 15:17.682
[both] The NeverKey.

15:17.684 --> 15:18.683
Huh?

15:18.685 --> 15:20.985
You know about the key?

15:20.987 --> 15:24.022
So, that's what you were
doing in that armor.

15:24.024 --> 15:26.057
Spying on us.

15:26.059 --> 15:29.227
Pirates will do
what pirates will do.

15:29.229 --> 15:31.663
Pirates like you,
Captain Hook.

15:31.665 --> 15:35.934
Well, crew, looks like we need
the NeverKey now more than ever.

15:35.936 --> 15:38.269
Mateys, will you help us
find The NeverKey

15:38.271 --> 15:41.940
to unlock me
and Captain Hook?

15:41.942 --> 15:43.174
Great!

15:43.176 --> 15:45.410
Keep a lookout
for gold doubloons.

15:45.412 --> 15:47.545
Whenever we solve
a Pirate Problem together,

15:47.547 --> 15:49.580
they'll appear.
Then we'll collect 'em

15:49.582 --> 15:51.716
and put 'em in our Team
Treasure Chest.

15:51.718 --> 15:53.318
Yo-ho, let's...

15:53.320 --> 15:55.086
Oh, enough chatter!

15:55.088 --> 15:57.689
I want these manacles
off me wrist.

15:57.691 --> 16:00.224
Follow me.
[shouting]

16:00.226 --> 16:03.394
Captain Hook,
on this treasure hunt,

16:03.396 --> 16:05.997
you and I are gonna
have to work together.

16:05.999 --> 16:07.565
Blast.

16:10.235 --> 16:12.570
<i>¶ Yo-ho, mateys, away! </i>

16:12.572 --> 16:15.606
<i>¶ There'll be treasure</i>
<i>and adventure today ¶</i>

16:15.608 --> 16:17.175
<i>¶ Let's go </i>

16:17.177 --> 16:20.578
<i>¶ Heave ho, here we go</i>
<i>Together as a team ¶</i>

16:20.580 --> 16:23.314
<i>¶ Jake and the</i>
<i>Never Land Pirates ¶</i>

16:23.316 --> 16:25.416
<i>¶ And me </i>

16:28.020 --> 16:30.989
Flamin' feathers.
A lava flow.

16:30.991 --> 16:33.091
Hop-Scotch Lava Flow.

16:33.093 --> 16:36.160
We have to hop across
on those rocks.

16:36.162 --> 16:38.696
You hop. I'll fly.

16:38.698 --> 16:43.067
[Smee] Oh, my,
that looks hot-hot-hot.

16:43.069 --> 16:45.503
That means
we hop-hop-hop.

16:45.505 --> 16:47.205
I'll go first.

16:47.207 --> 16:50.575
Hop. Hop. Hop.

16:50.577 --> 16:54.178
Me next.
Hop. Hop. Hop.

16:54.180 --> 16:55.580
Here I go.

16:55.582 --> 16:59.617
Hop. Hop. Hop.

16:59.619 --> 17:02.587
[laughing]
I made it.

17:02.589 --> 17:04.422
Come along, Cap'n.

17:04.424 --> 17:07.625
I'm on me way, Smee.
Hop. Whoa!

17:07.627 --> 17:10.261
- [grunting]
- [shouting]

17:10.263 --> 17:11.696
That won't work, Captain.

17:11.698 --> 17:13.798
We're attached at
the wrist, remember?

17:13.800 --> 17:17.201
Then hopping together
it is.

17:17.203 --> 17:19.804
[both] Hop. Hop. Hop.

17:19.806 --> 17:24.075
Glory be. I did it.
I made it.

17:24.077 --> 17:25.376
We all did.

17:25.378 --> 17:27.712
We hopped across
Hopscotch Lava Flow,

17:27.714 --> 17:29.714
and we got three
gold doubloons.

17:29.716 --> 17:32.650
Let's grab 'em
and go to... [gasps]

17:32.652 --> 17:35.219
...Pile-o-Bones Mountain.

17:37.089 --> 17:38.189
Crackers.

17:38.191 --> 17:40.191
All these rocks
look like bones.

17:40.193 --> 17:42.326
That's Skull Eye Tunnel.

17:42.328 --> 17:44.429
We have to
crawl through it.

17:44.431 --> 17:47.365
Oh, be still
me poor heart.

17:47.367 --> 17:49.400
Don't be a ninny, Smee.

17:49.402 --> 17:53.371
It's just a hole in the rock.
Commence crawling.

17:53.373 --> 17:55.673
Uh, Captain Hook,
I don't think it's wide enough

17:55.675 --> 17:58.109
for us to crawl through
side-by-side.

17:58.111 --> 18:00.812
Then I shall lead.
Captains first.

18:00.814 --> 18:03.614
Whoa!
Sorry, Captain.

18:03.616 --> 18:06.384
The chain's too short for
either of us to lead.

18:06.386 --> 18:08.152
If you two work together,

18:08.154 --> 18:10.721
and crawl through
face to face,

18:10.723 --> 18:12.356
one of you
crawling backward,

18:12.358 --> 18:14.492
and the other
crawling forward,

18:14.494 --> 18:16.561
you'll have plenty
of chain.

18:16.563 --> 18:19.630
But crawling backwards
makes me seasick.

18:19.632 --> 18:22.166
The Cap'n has
a sensitive tummy.

18:22.168 --> 18:23.734
I'll crawl backward,

18:23.736 --> 18:26.137
and you follow,
crawling forward.

18:26.139 --> 18:28.606
Yo-ho, let's go.

18:28.608 --> 18:31.542
I'll fly over
and meet you there.

18:32.811 --> 18:35.780
Crackers.
You made it through.

18:35.782 --> 18:38.816
Aye.
Izzy's plan worked great.

18:38.818 --> 18:40.518
Thanks, Jake.

18:40.520 --> 18:43.621
Now, we're one step closer
to the NeverKey.

18:43.623 --> 18:46.591
And we got three more
gold doubloons.

18:46.593 --> 18:48.259
Let's grab 'em and...

18:48.261 --> 18:52.196
Oh, mercy.
I seem to be stuck.

18:52.198 --> 18:54.132
We'll get you out,
Mr. Smee.

18:54.134 --> 18:56.667
Everybody ready?
Pull!

18:56.669 --> 18:59.170
[all grunting]

18:59.172 --> 19:01.739
[rumbling]

19:01.741 --> 19:03.207
Oopsie.

19:05.811 --> 19:07.812
Run!

19:11.683 --> 19:14.218
[Jake] That ditch.
Jump into it, everybody.

19:14.220 --> 19:16.821
[all shouting]

19:16.823 --> 19:18.389
[all gasping]

19:20.259 --> 19:22.326
Is everybody all right?

19:22.328 --> 19:25.163
Aye. But that boulder
sure isn't.

19:25.165 --> 19:27.398
It smashed to pieces
against that...

19:27.400 --> 19:29.534
...key-shaped stone.

19:29.536 --> 19:30.801
According to the map,

19:30.803 --> 19:33.671
the NeverKey is hidden
on top of it.

19:33.673 --> 19:37.909
Look. There's a hole carved
into the top of this rock.

19:37.911 --> 19:41.179
Yup, there's a key
down there, all right.

19:41.181 --> 19:42.847
Way down there.

19:42.849 --> 19:45.750
- We'll never reach it.
- [Hook] Step aside.

19:45.752 --> 19:49.687
I shall fish the key out
with me fishing-rod-hook.

19:49.689 --> 19:52.857
- Smee.
- Here ya go, Cap'n, sir.

19:55.794 --> 19:58.629
Ah. I've snagged it.

20:00.899 --> 20:03.968
Ha-ha!
The NeverKey is mine.

20:03.970 --> 20:05.536
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

20:05.538 --> 20:08.573
- Got it.
- [shouting]

20:08.575 --> 20:09.674
[all] Gotcha.

20:09.676 --> 20:12.610
Fie and fear of heights.
Help me!

20:12.612 --> 20:15.880
Boy, you sure are lucky
we're hooked together.

20:15.882 --> 20:17.782
It's a long way down.

20:17.784 --> 20:20.685
Yes, yes,
thank the four winds.

20:20.687 --> 20:24.689
Now save me.
This is an emergency.

20:24.691 --> 20:29.227
I'm on it.
Pixie Dust away.

20:37.369 --> 20:39.770
Yo-ho, mateys.

20:39.772 --> 20:41.806
We did it.
We found the NeverKey

20:41.808 --> 20:44.642
and unlocked
the rusty old manacles.

20:44.644 --> 20:47.712
And we got four more
gold doubloons.

20:47.714 --> 20:51.716
Let's grab 'em and go back
to Pirate Island.

20:51.718 --> 20:54.318
[Hook clearing throat]

20:54.320 --> 20:56.621
Forgotten someone,
puny pirate?

20:56.623 --> 20:58.789
Oh. [chuckles]
Right.

20:58.791 --> 21:00.825
Here you go, Captain Hook.

21:00.827 --> 21:03.794
I... I'm free.

21:03.796 --> 21:05.796
Free as a bird.

21:05.798 --> 21:08.799
- Nice, ain't it?
- Aye.

21:08.801 --> 21:11.435
The only thing
t'would make it nicer

21:11.437 --> 21:13.771
would be opening
me treasure.

21:13.773 --> 21:16.274
You found treasure?

21:16.276 --> 21:19.543
Well, we'd be glad
to help you unlock it.

21:23.048 --> 21:25.049
There ya go,
Captain Hook.

21:25.051 --> 21:26.917
Thank you,
puny pirates.

21:26.919 --> 21:29.553
Well, aren't you
gonna open it?

21:29.555 --> 21:31.756
Later. I don't want
to keep you.

21:31.758 --> 21:34.292
Ta-ta, popinjays.
Ta-ta now.

21:34.294 --> 21:38.629
OK, Captain Hook.
Crew, to Pirate Island.

21:40.732 --> 21:43.634
Thanks for helping us find
the NeverKey, mateys.

21:43.636 --> 21:45.636
Now let's put all
our Gold Doubloons

21:45.638 --> 21:47.772
into our Team
Treasure Chest.

21:54.846 --> 21:57.014
<i>¶ Way, hey</i>
<i>Well done, crew ¶</i>

21:57.016 --> 21:58.983
<i>¶ Everyone knew</i>
<i>just what to do ¶</i>

21:58.985 --> 22:01.052
<i>¶ Way, hey</i>
<i>with help from you ¶</i>

22:01.054 --> 22:04.055
<i>¶ It's time to count</i>
<i>our gold doubloons ¶</i>

22:04.057 --> 22:06.590
Come on, count with us.

22:06.592 --> 22:08.959
[all] Yeah!

22:08.961 --> 22:12.697
[Cubby] One, two, three...

22:12.699 --> 22:15.099
[Izzy] Four, five, six...

22:15.101 --> 22:19.003
[Jake] Seven, eight,
nine, ten.

22:19.005 --> 22:22.106
Yo-ho. For solving
Pirate Problems today,

22:22.108 --> 22:25.710
we got ten
gold doubloons.

22:25.712 --> 22:28.112
[Cubby] And we got
even more treasure.

22:28.114 --> 22:30.881
We got this cool
suit of armor.

22:30.883 --> 22:35.052
Cubby, that suit
is twice as tall as you.

22:35.054 --> 22:36.754
How can you walk or...?

22:36.756 --> 22:38.956
It takes two
to wear this thing.

22:38.958 --> 22:40.891
Jake and Hook
aren't the only ones

22:40.893 --> 22:42.360
who can work together.

22:42.362 --> 22:43.994
[laughing]

22:46.131 --> 22:47.765
Finally.

22:47.767 --> 22:51.435
Time to dig into me
very own treasure chest.

22:51.437 --> 22:54.105
Oh, goodie gumdrops.

22:55.374 --> 22:56.707
It looks like...

22:56.709 --> 22:58.008
[clanking]

22:58.010 --> 22:59.677
Manacles.

22:59.679 --> 23:00.978
Oh, dear.

23:00.980 --> 23:05.950
[Hook] Smee!
Get me out of these things!

23:05.952 --> 23:09.754
<i>¶ What's more sneaky</i>
<i>than the Snook? ¶</i>

23:09.756 --> 23:13.391
<i>¶ It's a cabinet full</i>
<i>of all his hooks ¶</i>

23:13.393 --> 23:15.926
<i>¶ Every one in his supply </i>

23:15.928 --> 23:19.764

<i>hook surprise ¶</i>

23:19.766 --> 23:21.732

<i>¶ Got a pinwheel hook</i>
<i>if you think that's odd ¶</i>

23:23.736 --> 23:25.503
<i>¶ Got a butterfly net,</i>
<i>flyswatter too ¶</i>

23:25.505 --> 23:27.805
<i>¶ He can catch a bug</i>
<i>and squish it, eww! ¶</i>

23:27.807 --> 23:29.940
<i>¶ Got a shovel hook</i>
<i>to dig things up ¶</i>

23:29.942 --> 23:31.776
<i>¶ Got a hammer and spoon</i>
<i>Don't mix those up ¶</i>

23:31.778 --> 23:34.478
<i>¶ Got a whirly-hook</i>
<i>so he can fly ¶</i>

23:34.480 --> 23:36.680
<i>¶ And an eggbeater hook</i>
<i>I don't know why ¶</i>

23:36.682 --> 23:37.915
<i>¶ Captain Hook </i>

23:37.917 --> 23:40.418
<i>¶ Oh, what a frumpy,</i>
<i>grumpy goose ¶</i>

23:40.420 --> 23:43.754
<i>¶ He never learned to share </i>

23:43.756 --> 23:45.489
<i>¶ Captain Hook </i>

23:45.491 --> 23:47.792
<i>¶ A stinky, finky,</i>
<i>double-crosser ¶</i>

23:47.794 --> 23:49.126
<i>¶ Mateys, best be </i>

23:49.128 --> 23:50.928
<i>¶ Mateys, best beware </i>

23:50.930 --> 23:54.198
<i>¶ He's after you,</i>
<i>so take a look ¶</i>

23:54.200 --> 23:56.934
<i>¶ He's the dastardly</i>
<i>Captain Hook ¶</i>

23:56.936 --> 23:59.003
<i>¶ Captain Hook </i>

23:59.005 --> 24:01.605
<i>¶ A stinky, finky,</i>
<i>double-crosser ¶</i>

24:01.607 --> 24:03.441
<i>¶ Mateys, best be </i>

24:03.443 --> 24:05.142
<i>¶ Mateys, best beware </i>
