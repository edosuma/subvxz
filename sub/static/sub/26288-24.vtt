00:00.359 --> 00:02.273
Previously, on
"NCIS"...

00:02.326 --> 00:03.980
You take every case
personally, too.

00:04.098 --> 00:06.262
- Enough.
- No, Rule Ten... it's B.S.

00:06.366 --> 00:08.635
<i>"Never get personally involved
on a case."</i>

00:08.723 --> 00:12.708
Rule Ten served as a
firewall to your feelings.

00:12.796 --> 00:14.065
They're both dead.

00:14.153 --> 00:16.489
<i>Your wife and daughter died
in the crash.</i>

00:16.577 --> 00:17.958
<i>I'm terribly sorry, Jethro.</i>

00:19.667 --> 00:21.027
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

00:25.343 --> 00:28.541
You expose this
witness, it ends me.

00:28.636 --> 00:30.436
FBI Agent Tobias Fornell.

00:30.524 --> 00:31.939
You think there's anything
you could say

00:32.026 --> 00:33.297
that would surprise us?

00:33.385 --> 00:35.479
I killed the man
who killed my family.

00:35.567 --> 00:37.416
- You're barely hanging on.
<i>- Gibbs!</i>

00:37.573 --> 00:41.104
It's Fornell. You need to get
to Mercy Point Hospital fast.

00:49.845 --> 00:51.314
You're gonna miss the turn.

00:54.731 --> 00:56.066
Careful!

00:56.488 --> 00:58.387
Need a little more
warning next time!

00:58.870 --> 01:00.214
You're gonna be okay, Fornell.

01:00.302 --> 01:01.627
We're almost there.

01:02.688 --> 01:03.758
I've never seen

01:03.846 --> 01:05.251
anyone this blue before.

01:05.391 --> 01:06.531
Hurry.

Hey!

01:17.320 --> 01:19.664
- We need help! In the back!
- Come on.

01:19.900 --> 01:21.068
Hurry, hurry.

01:21.156 --> 01:23.652
Okay, we're at the hospital.
You're going to be fine.

01:23.740 --> 01:25.168
- What happened?
- I don't know.

01:25.256 --> 01:26.126
Uh, one second
she's laughing,

01:26.213 --> 01:27.591
and the next,
she's laying on the ground.

01:27.678 --> 01:30.482
What's her name?
Emily. Emily Fornell.

01:30.779 --> 01:32.132
- Emily?
- Come on...

01:32.219 --> 01:33.920
Can you hear me?
Emily.

01:34.021 --> 01:35.623
Nothing.
I can't find a pulse.

01:35.711 --> 01:36.726
Call the cardiac team.

01:36.814 --> 01:38.000
Counting for chest compressions.

01:38.087 --> 01:40.079

Hey.
Tobias.

02:18.008 --> 02:19.397
Gibbs.

02:20.734 --> 02:22.345
You're here.
Thank you. Thank God.

02:22.495 --> 02:24.394
Hey, we came as soon
as we heard.

02:24.482 --> 02:25.605
Where's Emily, huh?

02:25.693 --> 02:27.331
Hey, Jack.

02:27.745 --> 02:29.550
- With the doctors.
- What happened?

02:29.789 --> 02:31.285
She was at some
college party.

02:31.373 --> 02:32.384
I guess she collapsed.

02:32.472 --> 02:35.670
They said she was
blue, Gibbs. Blue.

02:36.199 --> 02:38.191
- And what are they saying now?
- They don't know.

02:38.279 --> 02:40.009
It could be anything
between a bee sting

02:40.097 --> 02:42.261
- and a pulmonary embolism.
- Her lungs are fine,

02:42.357 --> 02:43.926
but we finished running
her blood, and...

02:44.013 --> 02:45.384
She's gonna be okay?

02:45.651 --> 02:47.191
We've stabilized her,
yes,

02:47.279 --> 02:49.324
but she is still in
critical condition.

02:49.620 --> 02:50.816
I want to see her.

02:50.904 --> 02:52.152
Of course.

02:54.425 --> 02:56.316
- You family?
- Uncle.

02:56.729 --> 02:58.241
Then you should
probably come with.

02:59.281 --> 03:00.738
Okay.

03:12.845 --> 03:14.495
I'm here, baby.

03:16.691 --> 03:17.949
I'm here.

03:26.104 --> 03:27.556
Why is she on a ventilator?

03:27.644 --> 03:29.152
She wasn't getting
enough oxygen.

03:29.393 --> 03:30.606
I thought you said
it wasn't her lungs.

03:30.693 --> 03:31.579
Correct.

03:31.667 --> 03:34.316
We were able to rule out
a pulmonary event rather quickly.

03:34.854 --> 03:36.285
So what is it?

03:37.244 --> 03:39.972
Has your daughter undergone
any surgeries recently?

03:40.402 --> 03:41.636
No.

03:41.803 --> 03:44.378
Been prescribed any medication
for any pain syndromes?

03:44.550 --> 03:45.696
No.

03:45.784 --> 03:47.750
You got something to say,
say it.

03:49.432 --> 03:51.785
Your daughter overdosed
on opioids.

03:54.777 --> 03:56.173
Where did you get
your medical degree?

03:56.260 --> 03:58.675
I know it's a hard
thing to hear,

03:58.893 --> 04:00.837
but right now we've
got bigger problems.

04:00.924 --> 04:02.996
Bigger than telling me that
my daughter is a dope addict?

04:03.083 --> 04:03.767
Tobias...

04:03.855 --> 04:05.075
I never suggested
she's an addict,

04:05.162 --> 04:07.716
but... that's a tomorrow
problem. Right now

04:08.085 --> 04:10.162
we have a right-now problem.

04:10.576 --> 04:12.542
She's not responding
to naloxone.

04:12.646 --> 04:14.566
- It's a drug that we use...
- I know what it is!

04:15.232 --> 04:17.668
Something you give
to dope addicts.

04:17.809 --> 04:19.271
She appears to
be allergic.

04:19.502 --> 04:21.951
It's caused a cascade response
in her vascular system.

04:22.067 --> 04:23.979
That's interfering
with her sinus rhythm.

04:24.066 --> 04:25.427
What does that mean?

04:25.912 --> 04:28.810
We are walking
a very fine line.

04:29.387 --> 04:32.676
Too much antidote, and we could
stop your daughter's heart.

04:33.138 --> 04:36.124
Too little, and she
could asphyxiate.

04:36.482 --> 04:37.857
No.

04:38.357 --> 04:40.394
You have to prepare yourself
for the possibility

04:40.482 --> 04:42.019
- she won't survive the night.
- No.

04:42.107 --> 04:44.534
But rest assured, we are doing
everything in our power to...

04:44.622 --> 04:45.734
Everything in our power?!

04:45.821 --> 04:47.013
Hey, hey.

04:48.269 --> 04:49.879
Then why are you
the only one standing here?

04:49.966 --> 04:51.949
Why is my little girl
alone in this room

04:52.037 --> 04:52.974
when you've got a whole building

04:53.061 --> 04:54.288
full of brainiacs
with medical degrees?

04:54.375 --> 04:55.311
Mr. Fornell...

04:55.399 --> 04:56.761
And how many more
at home sleeping?

04:56.849 --> 04:59.381
So why don't you wake
their sorry asses up

04:59.537 --> 05:03.466
and tell them to get in here and
figure this out? Do you hear me?

05:03.801 --> 05:05.971
All hands on deck!

05:06.059 --> 05:08.546
So no more standing around.
Get to work.

05:08.634 --> 05:10.490
And save my daughter's life!

05:20.074 --> 05:22.557
Look, I'm not gonna
press charges.

05:22.847 --> 05:23.901
I appreciate it.

05:23.989 --> 05:26.292
I get it.
I really do.

05:27.882 --> 05:29.864
And he looks like
he's calmed down now.

05:30.091 --> 05:31.466
It won't happen again.

05:31.574 --> 05:33.215
No, it won't.

05:33.911 --> 05:35.466
If he wants
to be let back inside,

05:35.560 --> 05:37.771
he's gonna need
to leave his bazooka at home.

05:41.495 --> 05:43.209
Hey, how's she doing?

05:43.539 --> 05:47.301
- Same. Sloane's with her.
- And Fornell?

05:48.011 --> 05:51.237
Yeah. We should probably
hang on to this for a while.

05:51.394 --> 05:53.392
We stopped by that college
party like you asked.

05:53.480 --> 05:54.714
And talked to Emily's friends.

05:54.801 --> 05:56.173
They said there's no way

05:56.261 --> 05:57.590
she would have taken anything.

05:57.678 --> 05:59.840
They think
maybe her drink was spiked.

05:59.928 --> 06:01.830
Apparently
that's been happening a lot

06:01.918 --> 06:03.246
on her campus lately.

06:03.760 --> 06:05.300
So not an overdose.

06:06.691 --> 06:07.744
A crime.

06:07.832 --> 06:10.171
It's not our jurisdiction,
but we alerted Campus P.D.

06:10.259 --> 06:11.314
They're all over it.

06:11.402 --> 06:13.129
I said I want them all.

06:13.217 --> 06:14.566
Is something wrong
with your hearing?

06:14.653 --> 06:17.058
Yeah, I heard you,
but the answer's no.

06:17.168 --> 06:18.647
There a problem?

06:19.151 --> 06:22.259
Yeah. I would like
to buy my daughter some flowers,

06:22.347 --> 06:24.253
and this jackass
is giving me a hard time.

06:24.394 --> 06:26.978
He wants them all.
I told Grumpelstiltskin here

06:27.066 --> 06:29.298
he's more than welcome
to purchase up to two.

06:29.386 --> 06:30.807
And you are more
than welcome to take those two

06:30.894 --> 06:31.994
and shove them up your...
Tobias, hey, come on.

06:32.081 --> 06:33.074
- Two.
- Come on.

06:33.162 --> 06:34.252
- Sorry.
- Let's go.

06:34.340 --> 06:35.980
I'm not really!

06:36.949 --> 06:38.358
What kind
of hospital pharmacy

06:38.446 --> 06:40.127
has a limit
on flower arrangements?

06:40.215 --> 06:41.558
It wasn't an overdose.

06:43.699 --> 06:45.004
She was drugged.

06:46.957 --> 06:49.011
I suppose that should
make me feel better.

06:49.565 --> 06:51.127
Except now
I want my gun back.

06:51.215 --> 06:52.915
Campus P.D...
they're on it.

06:53.027 --> 06:55.783
Campus P.D. Wouldn't trust them
to write a jaywalking ticket.

06:55.871 --> 06:56.995
Gibbs, I know
you haven't been playing

06:57.082 --> 06:58.020
with a full deck lately,

06:58.107 --> 06:59.949
but you need
to get your ass down to...

07:00.045 --> 07:02.401
And you need
to get your head in the game.

07:02.926 --> 07:06.027
Emily needs you, Tobias.
Your daughter needs you.

07:06.115 --> 07:08.165
What you need to do is
go upstairs right now

07:08.253 --> 07:09.558
and sit by her bed.

07:09.654 --> 07:12.470
And I'm gonna go home and
pick up some clothes for you.

07:12.596 --> 07:14.816
And you're not gonna
yell at anybody,

07:15.301 --> 07:16.933
and you're not
gonna shoot anybody.

07:17.261 --> 07:18.330
Got it?

07:18.426 --> 07:19.715
Got it.

07:22.463 --> 07:23.910
Where you going now?

07:24.273 --> 07:25.739
To find some nail polish.

07:53.378 --> 07:55.386
Yeah, that's a great idea.

07:56.222 --> 07:59.441
I mean, it's not like Tobias has
a drinking problem or anything.

08:00.905 --> 08:02.286
Go ahead and shoot.

08:02.381 --> 08:04.363
See if I care.
I'm already dead.

08:04.490 --> 08:06.707
Oh, and thanks for
that, by the way.

08:06.979 --> 08:08.722
Ruined my favorite
wool coat.

08:09.112 --> 08:11.722
Got blood all over it. Dick.

08:11.948 --> 08:13.326
This is not happening.

08:14.247 --> 08:16.417
Yes. Yeah, it's happening.

08:16.558 --> 08:19.254
The question you really
have to ask yourself is,

08:19.629 --> 08:20.888
what's happening?

08:22.293 --> 08:23.831
Yeah, I'm asking.

08:23.957 --> 08:26.517
Here's a hint. You're talking
to your dead ex-wife.

08:26.605 --> 08:27.900
It's usually a red flag.

08:27.988 --> 08:30.347
But the real question is,
what are you doing

08:30.504 --> 08:31.881
being a cabana boy

08:31.968 --> 08:33.215
instead of going to find

08:33.302 --> 08:34.884
the punk who dosed
my little girl?

08:34.972 --> 08:37.553
What? Excuse me!

08:37.640 --> 08:39.744
Tobias doesn't need
your old boxers.

08:39.832 --> 08:41.769
He needs <i>you</i> on the job.

08:41.857 --> 08:44.808
This case is not even
NCIS jurisdiction.

08:44.947 --> 08:46.695
How did you ever father a child

08:46.782 --> 08:48.898
with such a little,
tiny, shriveled...?

08:48.985 --> 08:51.957
I am not doing this.
I'm not doing this.

08:57.185 --> 08:59.019
Looks like we might
be doing this.

09:05.134 --> 09:07.605
Why does this stairwell smell
like burnt cheese?

09:08.097 --> 09:09.691
What do you want from me?

09:10.362 --> 09:13.191
I want
what my other ex-husband wants.

09:13.360 --> 09:15.980
I want you to find the guy
who drugged our daughter.

09:17.065 --> 09:18.597
It's not that simple.

09:19.115 --> 09:24.621
Oh, you have got to let
this Rule Ten nonsense go.

09:24.972 --> 09:26.758
So you're personally
involved in the case.

09:26.846 --> 09:30.043
Big deal. You also have
no fashion sense. Life goes on.

09:30.139 --> 09:35.201
When you get personally involved,
you make mistakes.

09:35.289 --> 09:37.179
No, that is just
a big fat excuse

09:37.266 --> 09:38.957
for the real problem here,
and you know it.

09:39.175 --> 09:41.359
You are running, Jethro.

09:43.096 --> 09:44.719
You're running scared.

09:45.010 --> 09:47.555
So you need to ask yourself...
Are you a man or a mouse?

09:47.650 --> 09:50.769
'Cause if you're a man,
get your head in the game!

09:54.496 --> 09:56.926
I want Emily Fornell's case.

09:57.331 --> 09:58.613
Took you long enough.

09:58.821 --> 10:00.066
I already wasted
too much time.

10:00.154 --> 10:02.121
All right, well,
I'll skip my prepared speech

10:02.209 --> 10:04.082
and go right
to the highlight reel. No.

10:04.418 --> 10:06.761
Leon, whoever drugged her
is still out there.

10:06.871 --> 10:07.943
They did it before.

10:08.030 --> 10:09.411
They are gonna do it again.

10:09.519 --> 10:11.480
Almost a dozen
cases last month.

10:11.567 --> 10:13.340
Next time could be a lot worse.

10:14.152 --> 10:15.345
As much as I would love

10:15.433 --> 10:17.111
to unleash you on the bastard

10:17.199 --> 10:19.388
that did this to Emily,
I cannot sanction it.

10:19.475 --> 10:21.517
- Come on!
- Gibbs, your personal connection

10:21.605 --> 10:24.324
to this case is bad enough, and
with the lack of jurisdiction,

10:24.412 --> 10:27.808
that's a good way to get us
all fired and probably worse.

10:29.269 --> 10:30.284
Duck!

10:30.372 --> 10:32.353
Jurisdiction...
Or in Latin,

10:32.441 --> 10:34.660
<i>iuris dicende causa...</i>

10:34.760 --> 10:36.566
The administration of justice.

10:36.654 --> 10:39.036
It came into use
in the latter part

10:39.168 --> 10:40.947
- of the 14th century...
- Skip ahead, Duck.

10:41.035 --> 10:42.208
Ah, right.

10:42.296 --> 10:44.606
Last year
the owner of the property

10:44.694 --> 10:47.114
where the alleged criminal act
occurred

10:47.202 --> 10:48.417
hired a contractor

10:48.504 --> 10:50.653
to add a second story.
Unfortunately,

10:50.740 --> 10:54.402
the contractor sued the
property owner for fraud.

10:54.490 --> 10:57.125
That case is
now in court.

10:57.334 --> 10:58.440
Mm-hmm.

10:58.528 --> 11:00.747
Last month, however,

11:00.835 --> 11:04.257
this same contractor
was hired,

11:04.353 --> 11:05.366
but this time

11:05.454 --> 11:08.319
on a Navy off-base house.

11:08.655 --> 11:09.684
I see.

11:09.772 --> 11:11.380
So, now...

11:11.468 --> 11:14.343
this Navy contractor

11:14.431 --> 11:16.216
is in a legal dispute...

11:16.304 --> 11:19.700
Stop. You had me
at <i>iuris dicende causa.</i>

11:19.788 --> 11:22.055
Yes,
it's within our purview

11:22.143 --> 11:23.819
to investigate
when one of our contractors

11:23.907 --> 11:25.655
is involved
in a criminal probe.

11:25.868 --> 11:27.634
However tangential.

11:29.912 --> 11:30.960
We good to go?

11:31.047 --> 11:33.224
Torres, talk
to any other victims.

11:33.312 --> 11:34.569
Bishop, McGee,

11:34.657 --> 11:37.072
interview everyone
who was at the party.

11:42.749 --> 11:44.741
See if there's
any cell phone footage.

11:44.927 --> 11:46.842
Chapsnats. Whatever.

11:46.929 --> 11:48.038
On it.

11:48.615 --> 11:51.054
Tell Sloane to work up
a profile on our suspect.

11:51.179 --> 11:52.481
Is everything okay?

11:53.179 --> 11:54.368
What do you think
that was about?

11:54.455 --> 11:55.455
I...

11:55.827 --> 11:58.382
Maybe he got
a Chapsnat.

12:02.694 --> 12:04.772
I'm not kidding, Dad.

12:04.860 --> 12:07.046
I hate flowers.
You never got the memo?

12:07.134 --> 12:08.614
What kind of
self-respecting girl

12:08.702 --> 12:09.898
does not like flowers?

12:09.985 --> 12:11.356
That's sexist,

12:11.444 --> 12:12.743
twice over.

12:14.156 --> 12:15.216
Hi, Uncle Gibbs.

12:15.304 --> 12:16.672
Hi, Em.

12:17.437 --> 12:18.520
Feeling better?

12:18.608 --> 12:20.218
Fine, actually.

12:20.390 --> 12:22.343
One minute she looks
like death warmed over...

12:22.431 --> 12:24.278
- Hey!
- And the next she is critiquing

12:24.366 --> 12:26.733
my interior decorating skills.

12:26.897 --> 12:29.543
The doctor said they found the
sweet spot with the naloxone.

12:29.631 --> 12:31.999
I just... can't believe
this happened to me.

12:32.087 --> 12:34.710
- Forget about that.
- I'm so careful, too.

12:34.798 --> 12:36.692
- Do you know who did it?
- No.

12:36.890 --> 12:38.560
Not yet.
But we're going to.

12:38.929 --> 12:40.013
Torres is on it.

12:40.101 --> 12:41.730
We can forget
about that, too.

12:42.288 --> 12:43.858
You're gonna be okay.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.247
That's what's important.

12:45.435 --> 12:46.895
Uh, when you going home?

12:46.983 --> 12:48.737
One more test
and she's all yours.

12:48.824 --> 12:50.007
Nurse?

12:50.250 --> 12:52.030
I can walk.

12:53.645 --> 12:55.998
What happened to my toes?

12:56.163 --> 12:57.302
Looks like

12:57.390 --> 12:58.881
your father happened.

12:58.968 --> 13:00.749
I was just returning
the favor.

13:01.053 --> 13:03.192
You touch my feet again,
and I'm filing

13:03.280 --> 13:05.296
a restraining order.

13:13.765 --> 13:15.596
What was with the 911?

13:15.929 --> 13:17.286
So, Vance gave you
jurisdiction?

13:17.374 --> 13:20.108
Well, yeah, but it sounded
like you don't want our help.

13:20.196 --> 13:21.819
Oh, I want.

13:29.365 --> 13:33.224
This... This opioid thing.
Always made me crazy,

13:33.312 --> 13:34.416
but now it's personal.

13:34.503 --> 13:35.451
Right there with you.

13:35.538 --> 13:37.895
Some punk drugged
my little girl.

13:37.983 --> 13:40.397
Some dealer sold that punk
the drugs.

13:40.485 --> 13:42.356
Promise me
that we will get them.

13:42.444 --> 13:43.778
Every single
last one of them.

13:43.866 --> 13:44.794
Yeah, right there with you.

13:44.882 --> 13:46.428
The chemist who made
the drugs, his mom,

13:46.515 --> 13:49.372
her dog walker, and screw
probable cause and warrants.

13:49.460 --> 13:50.615
We're gonna find them
wherever they are,

13:50.702 --> 13:51.935
and we're gonna put a bullet
in their heads.

13:52.022 --> 13:54.856
I know this is just the fight
you've been itching for.

13:54.944 --> 13:57.788
Promise me. Promise me
we're gonna get them all.

14:05.483 --> 14:06.960
So you didn't actually
see the guy

14:07.048 --> 14:08.343
who spiked Emily's drink?

14:08.476 --> 14:10.218
I didn't see him
do it, no,

14:10.313 --> 14:11.991
but Olivia and Hannah
said they did.

14:12.140 --> 14:14.999
Uh, tall guy. Was lurking
around her all night.

14:15.118 --> 14:16.399
Had a nose ring.

14:16.549 --> 14:17.549
Do you have a name?

14:17.719 --> 14:19.734
No, but, Spencer,
you talked to him?

14:19.966 --> 14:21.138
Just for a second.

14:21.226 --> 14:22.991
Can't believe
this happened to Emily.

14:23.079 --> 14:25.328
She doesn't drink,
doesn't smoke.

14:25.654 --> 14:27.040
Is she gonna be okay?

14:27.128 --> 14:29.377
Yes. She's already home
from the hospital.

14:29.464 --> 14:31.397
But this could've been
a whole lot worse.

14:31.708 --> 14:33.772
Is there anything else
you guys can think of?

14:34.288 --> 14:36.584
No.
Um...

14:37.467 --> 14:38.585
nope.

14:39.786 --> 14:41.491
Care to try that answer again?

14:41.579 --> 14:42.637
I found

14:42.725 --> 14:43.758
this...

14:43.845 --> 14:46.257
by the bar when we were
cleaning up this morning.

14:49.046 --> 14:51.210
Is there a reason
you didn't mention this sooner?

14:51.343 --> 14:53.101
Because it could be anybody's.

14:53.188 --> 14:54.335
And we didn't want to get

14:54.422 --> 14:56.104
the wrong person in trouble.

14:56.191 --> 14:57.749
- But...
- But...

14:57.894 --> 14:59.186
it's possible the person

14:59.274 --> 15:01.556
who spiked Emily's drink
dropped this.

15:01.660 --> 15:03.795
And we definitely
want to get <i>him</i>

15:03.883 --> 15:04.720
in trouble.

15:04.899 --> 15:06.614
Well, if this is
what I think it is,

15:06.701 --> 15:08.750
someone's definitely
getting in trouble.

15:08.837 --> 15:10.585
Starting with you two,
if I find out

15:10.672 --> 15:12.343
you're withholding
any other evidence.

15:13.453 --> 15:15.023
Seven of the victims
on her campus

15:15.110 --> 15:16.843
were able to give us
descriptions of the guy

15:16.945 --> 15:17.825
they think
drugged them.

15:17.912 --> 15:19.265
- How many had nose rings?
- One.

15:19.353 --> 15:20.404
That's our guy.

15:20.492 --> 15:21.889
Yeah, now all we got to do
is just find him.

15:21.976 --> 15:23.648
And I can help
with that.

15:23.765 --> 15:25.029
I analyzed the pill.

15:25.117 --> 15:26.945
Emily's friend found
at the party.

15:27.033 --> 15:29.336
It has the exact same
chemical composition

15:29.424 --> 15:31.005
as the opioid
she was drugged with.

15:31.092 --> 15:32.195
Our guy must've dropped it.

15:32.283 --> 15:33.289
Any DNA?

15:33.377 --> 15:35.375
Uh, nothing usable.
But... through the magic

15:35.463 --> 15:37.148
of chemical science,
I still

15:37.236 --> 15:38.304
have a lead.

15:38.399 --> 15:40.508
The pill is <i>not</i>
pharmaceutical grade.

15:40.666 --> 15:42.500
Take a look at
the optical isomers...

15:42.588 --> 15:43.701
No.

15:43.789 --> 15:45.053
Yeah, we're not gonna do that.

15:45.140 --> 15:47.468
Oh, right, I forgot.
You're both Level Ils.

15:47.695 --> 15:49.578
Bottom line,
this is a bootleg drug.

15:49.666 --> 15:50.780
And if we can figure out

15:50.868 --> 15:53.086
where this drink-spiking jerk
got it...

15:53.174 --> 15:54.617
It might lead
back to him.

15:54.758 --> 15:55.826
Kase,

15:55.914 --> 15:56.935
good work.

15:57.023 --> 15:59.320
Torres, BOLO on the pill.

15:59.551 --> 16:01.800
See if it shows up
in any other drug busts.

16:01.888 --> 16:04.804
And don't mention
any of this to Fornell.

16:04.892 --> 16:06.073
Copy that.

16:06.375 --> 16:07.593
Fornell?

16:07.937 --> 16:09.195
Level II?

16:11.733 --> 16:13.070
"Fifth-grade

16:13.158 --> 16:14.591
science or lower"?

16:16.069 --> 16:17.517
Okay, I'll take that.

16:17.605 --> 16:19.617
Why can't we mention
this to Fornell?

16:19.782 --> 16:21.437
Well, what would your dad do
to some guy

16:21.525 --> 16:22.788
who tried to drug you?

16:23.147 --> 16:25.014
Probably the same thing
that <i>you'd</i> do

16:25.102 --> 16:27.102
if someone tried
to do that to Bishop.

16:33.257 --> 16:34.609
Here. You're late.

16:34.703 --> 16:36.518
Meatloaf is
getting cold.

16:36.644 --> 16:38.171
It wasn't much better warm.

16:38.259 --> 16:40.099
You're more than welcome
to cook our next meal.

16:40.658 --> 16:41.890
Here.

16:43.200 --> 16:44.615
Have a date rape straw.

16:44.703 --> 16:45.747
It can detect five

16:45.834 --> 16:49.499
common sedatives. A gift
from my helicopter parent.

16:50.069 --> 16:51.736
Sounds like
a <i>smart</i> parent.

16:51.828 --> 16:52.882
Well, can you please

16:52.970 --> 16:54.812
tell him that I'm fine?
It happened,

16:54.900 --> 16:56.782
it's over. I would like
to put this behind me.

16:56.870 --> 16:58.515
He is right here.

16:58.828 --> 17:01.046
And the best defense
is a good offense.

17:01.156 --> 17:03.921
Says the man who put
a five-pound dongle

17:04.009 --> 17:05.569
- on my key chain.
- Yeah.

17:05.781 --> 17:07.719
Pepper spray.
It'll stop a bear.

17:07.821 --> 17:09.345
Ooh. Almost forgot.

17:11.171 --> 17:12.601
Help.

17:12.819 --> 17:14.531
For once I'm with Tobias.

17:14.873 --> 17:16.171
Back him up.

17:16.296 --> 17:17.757
Back him up,
or I'm gonna

17:17.845 --> 17:19.772
set up shop
in your bathroom.

17:22.367 --> 17:23.951
Bears can be dangerous.

17:24.038 --> 17:25.147
Good boy.

17:25.375 --> 17:26.608
Like it?

17:26.741 --> 17:28.161
It's a blinding
flashlight.

17:28.249 --> 17:29.190
1,000 lumens.

17:29.277 --> 17:30.763
It'll stop a bear, too.

17:30.851 --> 17:32.499
That's it.
I'm leaving.

17:32.648 --> 17:34.139
I have a student newspaper
meeting in an hour.

17:34.226 --> 17:35.163
I'll walk you
to the car.

17:35.250 --> 17:36.265
I'll go with.

17:36.368 --> 17:38.804
Nobody's coming with.
I can walk myself to my car.

17:38.892 --> 17:41.671
And any bear that gets
in my way is a dead man.

17:46.382 --> 17:47.966
It was a hell of a lot easier

17:48.086 --> 17:50.398
when I could solve all
of her problems by just

17:50.486 --> 17:53.301
taking her in my arms and
singing "Hush, Little Baby."

17:53.786 --> 17:55.945
Ooh! She forgot
the stun gun.

18:03.804 --> 18:04.847
Well?

18:04.935 --> 18:06.171
Nope.

18:08.193 --> 18:09.296
No?

18:09.384 --> 18:11.374
So you're just gonna
ignore me now?

18:12.474 --> 18:14.195
Pedro Hernandez.

18:16.445 --> 18:18.624
You never answered
Tobias's question.

18:19.084 --> 18:20.664
Are you gonna
get them?

18:22.015 --> 18:23.677
- Get who?
- Don't play dumb.

18:23.765 --> 18:25.404
The punk who drugged
my little girl.

18:25.492 --> 18:27.013
The dealer who gave
the punk the drugs.

18:27.101 --> 18:29.591
- My team's working on it.
- Your team?

18:29.679 --> 18:30.572
Mm-hmm.

18:30.659 --> 18:33.075
Yeah, your team has
to follow the rules.

18:33.450 --> 18:34.927
Sometimes the bad guy
gets away

18:35.015 --> 18:36.707
- when you follow the rules.
- He hasn't gotten away yet.

18:36.794 --> 18:40.198
If it comes to it,
are you going to do for <i>my</i> baby

18:40.286 --> 18:41.576
what you did for yours?

18:41.664 --> 18:42.878
What do you want from me?

18:42.966 --> 18:44.372
I want to know
who you are!

18:44.460 --> 18:46.786
I don't know who I am!

18:50.124 --> 18:51.575
Who are you
talking to?

18:54.410 --> 18:55.684
Nobody.

18:56.043 --> 18:57.458
Yes, you were.

18:57.778 --> 18:59.763
And you had...

19:00.474 --> 19:01.784
I don't know.

19:01.872 --> 19:05.395
Your tone.
It was familiar.

19:08.053 --> 19:09.935
It was the Diane tone.

19:11.965 --> 19:14.903
Were you having a conversation
with our dead ex-wife?

19:14.997 --> 19:16.112
No.

19:16.200 --> 19:17.630
Look, it's
perfectly normal.

19:17.763 --> 19:20.253
People talk
to deceased family members

19:20.341 --> 19:21.755
all the time.

19:22.567 --> 19:24.493
You can be honest about it.

19:24.988 --> 19:26.849
Is that
what you were doing?

19:28.223 --> 19:29.630
Yeah, maybe.

19:30.896 --> 19:32.349
Oh, my God.

19:34.974 --> 19:36.300
You... you're really going crazy.

19:36.388 --> 19:37.958
Going totally crazy.

19:38.145 --> 19:39.206
And you've got.

19:39.294 --> 19:41.235
- Diane stuck in your head.
- Yeah, it's Gibbs.

19:41.802 --> 19:43.872
No. No, that's Fornell.

19:44.122 --> 19:46.949
He's fine.
Where?

19:47.036 --> 19:48.044
All right. Be there.

19:48.132 --> 19:50.180
- I'm fine.
- You're not fine.

19:51.114 --> 19:52.340
<i>Where is he?</i>

19:52.442 --> 19:55.136
Over here.
Police found him passed out.

19:55.224 --> 19:56.550
Looks like a drug overdose.

19:56.638 --> 19:58.487
Paramedics revived him
with naloxone.

19:58.575 --> 20:00.253
They found these
in his pocket.

20:00.341 --> 20:04.216
Same triangle mark as the pill
Emily was drugged with.

20:05.903 --> 20:07.666
Special Agent Gibbs, NCIS.

20:07.754 --> 20:09.286
Need to ask
a few questions.

20:09.536 --> 20:11.005
Can you take
the cuffs off him?

20:11.170 --> 20:12.802
No, this guy's
going to jail.

20:12.890 --> 20:14.071
What's the charge?

20:14.188 --> 20:16.404
Possession of a narcotic
without a prescription.

20:16.616 --> 20:17.841
Was he dealing?

20:17.929 --> 20:19.021
No.

20:19.109 --> 20:20.419
Cuffs stay on.

20:20.716 --> 20:22.520
You got two minutes.

20:25.510 --> 20:27.258
What'd you want to ask me?

20:28.130 --> 20:29.567
You got a family?

20:30.026 --> 20:31.614
I did.

20:32.161 --> 20:34.794
My wife didn't want the kids
to see me like this, so...

20:35.279 --> 20:37.192
So,

20:37.535 --> 20:39.270
I'm trying to get clean.

20:39.527 --> 20:42.255
I am. It's just...

20:42.583 --> 20:44.353
When you're ready...

20:45.496 --> 20:47.349
call me.

20:49.130 --> 20:50.786
So, what'd you really
want to ask me?

20:51.810 --> 20:53.349
Where'd you get these?

20:53.700 --> 20:55.864
The guy's name
is Professor Ralphie.

20:56.312 --> 20:58.481
That's what everyone
calls him, anyway.

20:58.789 --> 21:01.560
Lives by the campus.
Sells to all the kids.

21:01.854 --> 21:03.278
You got an address?

21:03.366 --> 21:05.106
I'll even draw you a map.

21:06.596 --> 21:08.911
NCIS. Open up.

21:08.999 --> 21:10.614
He was a
pharmaceutical rep.

21:10.702 --> 21:13.148
Lost his job for
skimming meds.

21:17.067 --> 21:19.450
Oh, for Pete's sake.

21:19.693 --> 21:21.609
Are you waiting
for an invitation?

21:21.709 --> 21:24.959
Kick it in.
Maybe this'll help.

21:25.164 --> 21:28.304
♪ When I stepped in the game,
all of you knew my name ♪

21:28.392 --> 21:29.859
<i>♪ When I leave, I'll be good
long as I got same... ♪</i>

21:29.946 --> 21:31.527
Gibbs...

21:31.934 --> 21:33.048
Nose ring.

21:33.136 --> 21:36.405
It's our guy.
I'll check the back.

21:43.199 --> 21:44.593
Gibbs?

21:53.214 --> 21:55.077
Hi, Uncle Gibbs.

22:03.801 --> 22:05.749
If I had known Ralphie
was in trouble,

22:05.837 --> 22:07.375
I would've called 911.

22:07.463 --> 22:09.811
The foam cone around
his nose suggests anoxia

22:09.899 --> 22:11.266
following
pulmonary edema.

22:11.445 --> 22:13.146
In layman's terms, that is...

22:13.257 --> 22:14.549
Heroin overdose.

22:15.039 --> 22:16.528
I don't get it.

22:16.891 --> 22:18.875
He told me
he doesn't touch the stuff.

22:18.963 --> 22:21.445
Needle in his arm
suggests otherwise.

22:22.094 --> 22:23.453
Dust for prints.

22:24.156 --> 22:26.117
What are you gonna tell
my dad?

22:27.016 --> 22:28.852
Question is,
what are <i>you</i> gonna tell him?

22:28.945 --> 22:30.469
It's not what you think.

22:30.906 --> 22:32.904
I just came by to pick up
a little something,

22:32.992 --> 22:34.818
and Ralphie invited me

22:34.906 --> 22:37.215
to party,
so, I stayed.

22:37.624 --> 22:41.297
So... he didn't spike your drink
the other night, did he?

22:43.564 --> 22:44.912
Is he your boyfriend?

22:45.000 --> 22:46.125
No.

22:46.515 --> 22:47.859
He's your dealer.

22:47.977 --> 22:49.427
Your what?

22:50.797 --> 22:51.912
Your dealer?

22:52.039 --> 22:54.232
- My daughter has a dealer?
- Dad, calm down.

22:54.320 --> 22:55.567
Oh, Dad is not calming down.

22:55.654 --> 22:57.443
Then back off.
He's just a friend.

22:57.531 --> 22:59.047
Everything is under control.

22:59.141 --> 23:02.188
Really? Almost dying
in the ER one day

23:02.367 --> 23:04.021
and getting high
with a corpse the next

23:04.109 --> 23:05.672
is your idea of "under control"?

23:05.789 --> 23:07.470
What does out of control
look like?

23:07.992 --> 23:09.078
You need help, Emily.

23:09.166 --> 23:11.081
My life is none
of your business.

23:11.408 --> 23:12.741
None of my what?

23:14.219 --> 23:18.047
I am the only parent
that you have left,

23:18.212 --> 23:20.531
in case you didn't notice.
How dare you?

23:23.845 --> 23:25.328
You get back here.

23:25.770 --> 23:27.109
Boss, we got a problem.

23:27.250 --> 23:28.640
You think?

23:28.728 --> 23:30.140
No, the syringe.

23:30.228 --> 23:32.277
There's no prints on it.
It's been wiped clean.

23:32.365 --> 23:33.312
Yeah, and check this out.

23:33.400 --> 23:35.359
I found a secondary
injection point.

23:35.468 --> 23:38.093
Looks like he was jabbed
from behind. Gibbs,

23:38.181 --> 23:40.172
I think this crime scene
was staged.

23:40.963 --> 23:42.703
This wasn't
an accidental overdose.

23:42.871 --> 23:45.297
- It was a murder.
- A what?

23:46.365 --> 23:47.914
What are you doing here?

23:48.192 --> 23:49.422
I live here.

23:49.674 --> 23:52.422
You live with an opioid dealer
who's got a nose ring?

23:52.510 --> 23:54.781
That slip your mind
when we talked this morning?

23:55.346 --> 23:57.032
Do these handcuffs
have to be so tight?

23:57.119 --> 23:58.333
Yes.

23:58.448 --> 24:00.563
This is all a big
misunderstanding.

24:00.909 --> 24:03.390
Great.
Can't wait to hear all about it.

24:03.623 --> 24:05.156
Me, too.

24:07.482 --> 24:09.002
You got to be kidding me.

24:09.532 --> 24:10.932
Sorry, what's that, boss?

24:12.437 --> 24:14.398
You got to be kidding me

24:14.486 --> 24:17.069
that this is all
a big misunderstanding.

24:17.169 --> 24:19.084
Yeah, that's real smooth,
Woodchuck.

24:19.492 --> 24:21.047
Excuse me, boss.

24:21.279 --> 24:23.359
Nice watch, McGee.

24:24.375 --> 24:26.108
Thanks. Let's go.

24:27.342 --> 24:28.976
- You coming?
- No.

24:29.175 --> 24:32.632
I am most definitely
not coming.

24:38.140 --> 24:39.515
All right.

24:41.343 --> 24:43.258
- What now?
- What now?

24:43.718 --> 24:46.320
You mean, besides
my daughter being a drug addict?

24:47.619 --> 24:48.867
And I blame you.

24:48.955 --> 24:50.547
Me?!

24:50.983 --> 24:52.656
You're a piece of work, Diane!

24:52.744 --> 24:55.390
When I was killed, Tobias
needed you more than anything,

24:55.478 --> 24:56.523
and where were you?

24:56.611 --> 24:58.094
I was right here.
Yeah, "right here,"

24:58.182 --> 25:00.097
getting him fired from the FBI.

25:00.497 --> 25:03.976
He was a single father
trying to raise a teenage girl

25:04.064 --> 25:06.992
all by himself,
struggling with alcoholism,

25:07.150 --> 25:09.734
and you take away the one thing
that was keeping him stable?

25:09.945 --> 25:11.829
- And now look what happened.
- I know what happened.

25:11.916 --> 25:13.523
Y-You don't think
that I know?

25:13.611 --> 25:15.227
- Oh, blah, blah, blah. Yada,
- Not a day goes by

25:15.314 --> 25:18.354
- yada, yada, tell it to the judge.
- That I don't think about what happened.

25:21.534 --> 25:24.242
What are we doing here?

25:24.480 --> 25:26.313
You still haven't answered
Tobias's question.

25:26.401 --> 25:27.906
And now you haven't
answered mine.

25:27.994 --> 25:29.906
- Which is what?
- Somebody got

25:29.994 --> 25:31.680
my baby hooked on drugs.

25:32.122 --> 25:34.008
And now she's wrapped up
in a murder?

25:34.121 --> 25:35.742
You got a question
in there somewhere?

25:35.830 --> 25:39.581
Yeah. If your badge
can't get this guy,

25:40.335 --> 25:42.360
are you gonna get him anyway?

25:47.117 --> 25:48.750
This is all your fault.

25:50.731 --> 25:52.227
You owe Tobias.

25:54.051 --> 25:55.555
You owe all of us.

26:00.336 --> 26:01.391
Hey.

26:01.479 --> 26:03.650
I heard about your
famous elevator talks, and,

26:03.737 --> 26:07.664
and I was walking by,
a-and I thought I heard...

26:09.286 --> 26:12.736
Yeah, but you're alone,
so, uh...

26:13.064 --> 26:15.423
You know what? I'm just gonna
stand here with my eyes closed

26:15.510 --> 26:16.742
until you walk away.

26:21.553 --> 26:22.664
Where you been?

26:22.752 --> 26:24.672
Impounding Ralphie's
car. Where's Emily?

26:24.935 --> 26:26.578
I don't know,
she won't talk to me.

26:26.735 --> 26:27.781
But I need to find out

26:27.869 --> 26:30.018
where this started,
who gave her that first pill.

26:30.476 --> 26:32.172
You don't go
straight to dealers.

26:32.293 --> 26:34.656
So I figured I'd come
where the action was.

26:35.141 --> 26:36.219
Yeah.

26:36.322 --> 26:37.643
Okay, what do we know
on the victim?/.

26:37.730 --> 26:38.877
Um...

26:39.404 --> 26:42.245
Before Professor Ralphie
was a pharmaceutical rep,

26:42.333 --> 26:45.125
he was a student
at Emily's college.

26:45.213 --> 26:47.492
Pharmacy school, which
he flunked out of.

26:47.649 --> 26:48.774
Winning.

26:48.862 --> 26:50.867
Other than a few
jaywalking tickets,

26:50.955 --> 26:53.406
he's managed to stay
under the radar.

26:53.652 --> 26:55.868
Not much in
his credit card statements.

26:56.056 --> 26:58.371
Then again, dealers
are mostly cash.

26:58.575 --> 27:00.156
Actually, I...

27:02.375 --> 27:03.719
What?

27:03.818 --> 27:05.430
Actually, I should go.

27:05.634 --> 27:08.086
Try to talk to Emily again.
Maybe she knows something.

27:11.210 --> 27:12.461
Okay, who killed him?

27:12.549 --> 27:13.563
Rival dealer?

27:13.721 --> 27:15.360
Maybe a drug buy
gone bad?

27:15.448 --> 27:18.469
Oh, my gut says, if we want
to find Ralphie's killer,

27:19.292 --> 27:21.313
we find out where he was
getting his supply.

27:21.992 --> 27:23.461
What do you want from me?

27:24.180 --> 27:26.672
We want to know where Ralphie
was getting his supply.

27:27.091 --> 27:28.399
I don't know.

27:29.344 --> 27:31.828
I put an ad on the school
website for a roommate.

27:31.916 --> 27:34.732
Ralphie answered.
I, I hardly know the guy.

27:34.884 --> 27:36.599
Please don't play dumb.

27:37.125 --> 27:38.672
It's so unattractive.

27:38.954 --> 27:42.344
I'm not playing, okay?
I'm an art major.

27:42.898 --> 27:44.527
My brother was the smart one.

27:44.615 --> 27:46.597
Well, then, maybe you should
call him up and have him explain

27:46.684 --> 27:48.789
to you obstruction of justice.

27:49.117 --> 27:50.774
Wh-What did I obstruct?

27:50.988 --> 27:54.125
Well, for starters, you told me
that Olivia and Hannah

27:54.213 --> 27:56.172
saw someone spike Emily's drink.

27:56.260 --> 27:57.689
Except we spoke
to both of them,

27:57.776 --> 27:59.086
and they never said that.

28:01.492 --> 28:02.828
Maybe I heard wrong.

28:02.916 --> 28:05.665
Or maybe you knew that
Emily had a drug problem.

28:05.810 --> 28:07.844
And you were covering up
for her because you knew

28:07.932 --> 28:09.647
that it would lead
back to you.

28:09.961 --> 28:12.477
O-Okay,
you guys are way off base.

28:12.565 --> 28:14.367
Sure, I knew Emily was using,

28:14.487 --> 28:16.102
but I didn't know
how bad it had gotten.

28:16.190 --> 28:18.602
I would have never introduced
her to Ralphie if I'd known.

28:18.690 --> 28:20.774
Okay, your
"get out of obstruction" card

28:20.862 --> 28:22.086
is about to expire.

28:22.174 --> 28:24.258
Where does your roommate
get his supply?

28:27.717 --> 28:29.319
Going once...

28:30.567 --> 28:33.016
- ...going twice.
- Whoa-hey, hey.

28:33.702 --> 28:36.656
He got his supply
from some pill-happy doctor

28:36.744 --> 28:38.235
that Emily
had introduced him to.

28:38.334 --> 28:39.715
Do you have a name?

28:40.217 --> 28:41.217
No.

28:41.327 --> 28:42.672
I-I swear.

28:43.774 --> 28:45.610
But... his office
was in Littleton.

28:45.698 --> 28:47.360
He was a podiatrist, I think?

28:50.815 --> 28:53.110
Hey, hello there.
I'm Dr. Berman.

28:54.112 --> 28:55.539
- Tobias Fornell.
- Yeah.

28:55.782 --> 28:57.883
So, uh, my nurse tells
me that you're suffering

28:57.971 --> 28:59.633
from a little, uh, hammertoe?

28:59.721 --> 29:01.269
Been a problem for years.

29:01.357 --> 29:03.317
Oh, okay, well, let's take
a look at it, shall we?

29:04.882 --> 29:06.296
By any chance,

29:06.384 --> 29:09.422
does my last name
sound familiar to you? Fornell?

29:10.080 --> 29:13.524
No, but, uh, my nurse tells me
that you're a new patient.

29:13.612 --> 29:16.305
I am, but my daughter
used to come here.

29:16.393 --> 29:19.461
I dropped her off a few times.
Her name's Emily.

29:19.796 --> 29:21.645
Doesn't ring a bell.

29:22.070 --> 29:24.055
Your foot is perfectly normal,
Mr. Fornell.

29:26.028 --> 29:29.188
Oh, there is absolutely nothing
normal about me, trust me.

29:29.276 --> 29:31.766
I'm here

29:31.854 --> 29:36.836
because I saw your name
on a credit card statement

29:36.938 --> 29:38.844
belonging to a drug dealer.

29:39.641 --> 29:42.982
I'm not sure
I'm following. Uh...

29:43.194 --> 29:46.102
A drug dealer...

29:47.787 --> 29:49.985
...who's been selling drugs
to my daughter.

29:51.090 --> 29:52.305
It's funny,
isn't it,

29:52.490 --> 29:57.633
that both she and he should go
to the same pill-happy doctor.

29:58.214 --> 30:01.031
It's what we call in the biz
a coincidence.

30:01.418 --> 30:03.750
Except maybe it's not.

30:04.835 --> 30:06.188
You following?

30:06.371 --> 30:07.656
No.

30:08.648 --> 30:10.078
You'll have to excuse me.

30:10.340 --> 30:11.836
Oh, I will not.

30:12.741 --> 30:15.149
I will not excuse you.

30:20.826 --> 30:22.778
I will never excuse you.

30:29.473 --> 30:32.308
Well, no, so I'm confused.
Did you find the doctor or not?

30:32.396 --> 30:33.960
Well, it wasn't that hard.

30:34.183 --> 30:35.832
There was one podiatrist
in Littleton,

30:35.895 --> 30:37.314
but there was a small problem.

30:37.402 --> 30:38.972
What?

30:39.688 --> 30:41.486
Uh, Fornell beat us to him.

30:41.971 --> 30:43.716
He must have seen
something in the squad room

30:43.803 --> 30:45.017
that tipped him off.

30:45.228 --> 30:46.431
How bad?

30:46.557 --> 30:49.056
We got there just in time,
but Fornell was getting ready

30:49.144 --> 30:50.314
to waterboard the guy.

30:50.402 --> 30:52.258
The doc said he's not gonna
press charges...

30:52.346 --> 30:54.193
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I know the drill.

30:54.281 --> 30:55.939
<i>I have done nothing wrong.</i>

30:56.027 --> 30:58.525
Your daughter came to me and she
was in pain, so I treated her.

30:58.613 --> 31:00.861
She had a bone spur,
you prescribed her opioids?

31:00.949 --> 31:03.525
- Oh, thank God.
- What do you do for a hangnail, morphine?

31:03.613 --> 31:05.495
Fornell asked me to review
his daughter's medical records.

31:05.582 --> 31:06.651
I think I made things worse.

31:06.738 --> 31:08.128
- Tobias.
- Have you ever heard of aspirin?

31:08.215 --> 31:10.497
Tobias, calm down.
Everybody else, sit down.

31:10.720 --> 31:13.213
Special Agent Gibbs.
I only have one question for you.

31:14.908 --> 31:16.475
You know that guy?

31:17.303 --> 31:18.303
Sit down.

31:19.134 --> 31:20.245
Do you know that guy?

31:20.300 --> 31:21.228
Look, your agents have already

31:21.316 --> 31:22.364
told me about your concerns,

31:22.451 --> 31:23.966
but I can assure you,
I have

31:24.054 --> 31:26.501
never prescribed anyone
enough opioids for them

31:26.604 --> 31:28.314
to start dealing,
much less this guy.

31:28.402 --> 31:30.860
You got my little girl
hooked on drugs.

31:30.948 --> 31:32.500
- I saw him once.
- Okay, all right.

31:32.587 --> 31:34.098
It says here
you were Luna Bay Labs'

31:34.185 --> 31:35.599
top prescriber in the district?

31:35.686 --> 31:37.587
Got a free trip to Cancun.

31:37.675 --> 31:39.627
Her friends said that
she'd never touched the stuff

31:39.714 --> 31:41.629
until you prescribed it.
And for what?

31:41.717 --> 31:43.197
To work on your tan?

31:44.548 --> 31:45.829
Everything I've done

31:46.063 --> 31:49.343
is perfectly legal,
so if your drug dealers

31:49.431 --> 31:51.526
are selling drugs, they're
getting it from someplace else.

31:51.613 --> 31:53.798
And... yeah, and you are free
to audit my records

31:53.886 --> 31:55.753
if you don't believe me.

32:12.924 --> 32:14.150
Hey.

32:14.667 --> 32:16.415
You done auditing
those records?

32:16.503 --> 32:17.784
What's taking you so long?

32:17.965 --> 32:19.267
Working on it.

32:19.803 --> 32:22.954
Thought you and Emily were
seeing Dr. Grace tonight.

32:23.157 --> 32:24.374
She won't go.

32:24.462 --> 32:25.509
Found out today

32:25.626 --> 32:27.181
she hasn't been
to class in weeks.

32:27.269 --> 32:30.290
Her school doesn't even have
a student newspaper.

32:30.461 --> 32:32.314
Gibbs, how did I miss this?

32:32.402 --> 32:34.783
How did I totally
and completely miss this?

32:34.871 --> 32:35.785
Everybody did.

32:35.873 --> 32:37.033
The harder
I try to help her,

32:37.121 --> 32:39.455
the more I'm driving her away.

32:41.804 --> 32:43.228
I am over my head.

32:43.323 --> 32:45.165
I don't know what to do.
I need...

32:48.447 --> 32:49.697
I need her mother.

32:55.454 --> 32:58.210
What are the chances
you're really talking to...?

32:58.298 --> 32:59.950
No. No way.

33:00.494 --> 33:02.369
- Just ask her what I should do.
- No.

33:02.457 --> 33:03.605
Tobias, it's not gonna happen.

33:03.692 --> 33:06.375
And tell me what she says.
Easy peasy.

33:06.463 --> 33:08.439
Tobias, look,

33:08.527 --> 33:11.643
I'm not really talking
to Diane. I just...

33:11.813 --> 33:14.501
- You're losing your mind?
- Fine, I'll take that.

33:14.589 --> 33:15.604
Because I'm losing my daughter,

33:15.691 --> 33:17.811
and you know what that
will do to me, so if there's...

33:17.901 --> 33:20.083
if there is even
a one-out-of-a-thousand chance

33:20.171 --> 33:23.552
that you are talking
to our ex-wife,

33:23.640 --> 33:27.046
then humor me. I beg you because
I'm at the end of my rope.

33:27.532 --> 33:31.788
Jethro, tell me what sh-she says
I should do, please.

33:36.914 --> 33:38.429
Okay.

33:39.010 --> 33:40.492
Okay.

33:40.988 --> 33:42.867
- She says...
- What?

33:46.788 --> 33:48.343
What?

33:51.406 --> 33:53.406
Nice to know
things don't change.

33:53.494 --> 33:55.042
Well, certainly
not that sweater.

33:55.296 --> 33:57.546
God, I told you to get
rid of that years ago.

34:00.087 --> 34:01.987
What do I do, Diane?

34:03.390 --> 34:05.843
Stop trying to do anything.

34:06.904 --> 34:09.023
Take off your Mr. Fix-It hat

34:09.525 --> 34:11.929
and just be there
for your daughter.

34:13.320 --> 34:15.159
That's not very actionable.

34:15.281 --> 34:17.116
Emily doesn't need
action right now,

34:17.204 --> 34:19.045
she just needs her father,

34:19.600 --> 34:21.210
not solutions.

34:22.523 --> 34:24.453
You just be...

34:25.315 --> 34:26.914
her father.

34:29.601 --> 34:31.679
I'm sorry
I couldn't protect you.

34:34.899 --> 34:37.281
I'm sorry I didn't answer
the phone that night.

34:41.375 --> 34:42.639
Yeah. Gibbs.

34:43.273 --> 34:44.304
Boss, hey.

34:44.391 --> 34:46.748
We finished auditing
that doctor's records.

34:46.835 --> 34:47.891
And?

34:47.978 --> 34:49.226
He was telling the truth.

34:49.313 --> 34:52.125
He wasn't prescribing enough
pills for Ralphie to deal.

34:52.213 --> 34:54.547
Ralphie was prescribing them
to himself.

34:54.641 --> 34:56.922
Yeah, looks like Ralphie
stole a prescription pad

34:57.033 --> 34:59.703
from the doctor's office,
has been forging scripts.

34:59.791 --> 35:02.179
And then was getting them filled
with a pharmacist

35:02.267 --> 35:03.906
who was willing to look
the other way.

35:04.072 --> 35:05.773
Got a name, bring 'em in.

35:06.217 --> 35:07.256
Who?

35:07.384 --> 35:09.336
Time to buy some more flowers.

35:09.669 --> 35:12.000
You're kidding me.
The flower Nazi?

35:12.088 --> 35:13.288
Yup.

35:15.304 --> 35:16.404
Thank you.

35:16.492 --> 35:18.775
Don't mention it,
and by that, I mean...

35:18.863 --> 35:20.617
Never mention it.

35:20.745 --> 35:22.023
I know.

35:23.523 --> 35:24.857
You had to know
the prescriptions.

35:24.945 --> 35:26.780
Ralphie was bringing you
were forged.

35:26.868 --> 35:30.085
I mean, tens of thousands
of pills from the same doctor?

35:30.173 --> 35:31.768
You can't prove
what I know.

35:32.062 --> 35:34.562
I can prove that the syringe

35:34.675 --> 35:36.924
that was used to killed Ralphie
was sold in your store.

35:37.042 --> 35:39.116
Yeah, I sell a lot of syringes.

35:39.204 --> 35:40.539
So, what's funny

35:40.627 --> 35:42.344
about this one is
that the murderer

35:42.432 --> 35:44.414
tried to, uh, wipe it
of its prints,

35:44.506 --> 35:45.687
but you know what he forgot?

35:45.970 --> 35:47.500
It's not my problem.

35:48.454 --> 35:50.282
He forgot to wipe the needle,

35:50.633 --> 35:52.719
so we were able
to pull touch DNA,

35:52.807 --> 35:55.875
and it was yours, in fact,

35:56.485 --> 35:59.125
which kind of makes it
your problem now.

35:59.854 --> 36:03.196
Just in time.
He is about to sing like a bird.

36:05.891 --> 36:08.813
Look, it-it was
an accident, okay?

36:09.086 --> 36:11.101
Who's Grumpelstiltskin now?

36:11.228 --> 36:13.644
I-I got worried
when NCIS started

36:13.731 --> 36:15.479
poking around.
I went to warn Ralphie,

36:15.566 --> 36:18.549
and things just got out of hand.

36:18.788 --> 36:21.102
And that's case closed,
gentlemen.

36:21.307 --> 36:23.961
This case, yeah,
but if you want

36:24.049 --> 36:26.265
to kill the snake,
you got to cut off the head.

36:26.680 --> 36:28.016
Gibbs...

36:30.142 --> 36:31.954
...we gonna go
all the way or not?

36:41.571 --> 36:43.079
Don't forget the date.

36:46.697 --> 36:48.032
What now?

36:52.391 --> 36:53.505
Look,

36:53.771 --> 36:55.319
it really was an accident.

36:55.874 --> 36:57.875
Where'd you get the pills
you sold to Ralphie?

36:58.045 --> 36:59.321
Same place I get
all my pills,

36:59.409 --> 37:01.672
- from the pharmaceutical companies.
- No.

37:02.500 --> 37:06.024
Emily Fornell had counterfeit
opioids in her blood.

37:08.609 --> 37:09.892
Which means that
you were filling.

37:09.979 --> 37:13.610
Ralphie's forged prescription
with gray market pills.

37:14.329 --> 37:15.539
Pills that were
coming across

37:15.627 --> 37:17.360
the border from Canada,

37:18.047 --> 37:19.461
so I hear.

37:20.058 --> 37:21.305
From who?

37:21.393 --> 37:24.565
Sounds like Gibbs been
working a side project.

37:28.627 --> 37:30.025
I want a name.

37:30.533 --> 37:31.775
No way.

37:31.952 --> 37:33.650
You're going to prison
for murder.

37:34.095 --> 37:35.492
You do not want to mess
with this guy.

37:35.579 --> 37:37.861
Oh, yeah, I do.
Yeah, I do. Trust me.

37:38.049 --> 37:39.166
Well, I don't.

37:39.321 --> 37:41.908
Maybe I go to prison,
maybe I-I get off.

37:41.996 --> 37:43.307
You're not gonna get off.

37:44.388 --> 37:46.291
I give you that name,
I'm a dead man.

37:46.963 --> 37:49.408
You are already dead.

37:58.822 --> 37:59.853
Emily...

37:59.941 --> 38:02.853
I'm going back to my dorm.
I just came by to pick up a few things.

38:03.532 --> 38:05.016
- We need...
- To see Dr. Grace?

38:05.104 --> 38:06.986
No, we don't, but maybe you do.

38:08.485 --> 38:09.659
If you think so.

38:09.868 --> 38:11.727
There's nothing wrong with me.

38:11.955 --> 38:13.752
And nothing that
needs to be fixed.

38:13.840 --> 38:15.303
And there's nothing
for you to do.

38:15.391 --> 38:16.635
All I need from you

38:16.723 --> 38:19.799
is for you to leave me alone!

38:36.774 --> 38:39.657
I need help, Daddy.

38:40.883 --> 38:42.204
I know.

38:46.729 --> 38:48.744
I'm so sorry.

38:49.097 --> 38:53.017
I'm so, so sorry.

38:53.691 --> 38:55.501
Me, too, baby. Me, too.

38:59.563 --> 39:02.931
I love you so much.

39:04.626 --> 39:07.447
- Your mother, too.
- I know.

39:09.304 --> 39:10.814
She told me.

39:12.789 --> 39:13.970
When I was in
the hospital,

39:14.058 --> 39:15.640
I had a dream
that I saw her.

39:15.728 --> 39:18.275
She said she loved me
to the moon and back

39:20.183 --> 39:23.775
and that Gibbs's house
smelled like burnt cheese.

39:34.669 --> 39:36.814
Yeah, we got him.

39:38.085 --> 39:40.788
And I didn't have to get
all Pedro Hernandez

39:40.876 --> 39:42.413
on anybody, either.

39:45.876 --> 39:48.876
Except you're not done
with this one yet, are you?

39:52.212 --> 39:53.540
Why are you here?

39:54.064 --> 39:56.454
Aside from me losing my mind.

39:56.638 --> 39:58.653
Oh, please,

39:58.889 --> 40:01.103
you were never that sane
to begin with.

40:03.079 --> 40:04.494
But why now?

40:04.654 --> 40:07.869
Because you needed a kick
in the pants to take this case.

40:08.354 --> 40:10.102
Remind me why again?

40:11.102 --> 40:13.423
When you get
personally involved,

40:13.726 --> 40:15.048
you make mistakes.

40:15.165 --> 40:16.306
Right.

40:17.267 --> 40:19.978
Except you and I both know
that that rule is crap.

40:20.720 --> 40:24.415
The reason that you don't want
to get personally involved

40:24.882 --> 40:27.939
is that you're afraid
to feel, Jethro.

40:29.009 --> 40:31.626
Ever since your family
was killed,

40:32.122 --> 40:34.056
you shut yourself off

40:34.496 --> 40:36.642
so you wouldn't have
to get hurt again.

40:37.193 --> 40:40.409
And work, the one place
where you were really alive,

40:40.590 --> 40:42.738
well, couldn't have that,

40:42.826 --> 40:45.283
so you had to build up walls
there, too.

40:46.668 --> 40:50.251
And that is the reason that
I am really here, Jethro,

40:51.523 --> 40:54.361
'cause now those walls
are starting to crumble.

40:55.913 --> 40:57.658
You're starting
to let people in again,

40:57.746 --> 40:59.134
and it is scary

40:59.798 --> 41:04.009
and, for someone
like you, dangerous.

41:05.973 --> 41:08.087
So you reached out for help.

41:09.056 --> 41:10.751
Voilà.

41:13.680 --> 41:15.251
I'm just talking to myself.

41:15.401 --> 41:17.204
Yeah, maybe,

41:17.957 --> 41:19.431
but at least
you're talking.

41:20.804 --> 41:23.408
And when you're ready
to talk some more,

41:24.117 --> 41:26.759
we're all here for you, inside.

41:27.525 --> 41:29.298
All you got to do is ask.

41:34.930 --> 41:37.469
You don't have to face
the danger alone.

41:48.743 --> 41:51.688
All right, what now?

41:58.061 --> 41:59.527
Hello, Gibbs.

42:01.141 --> 42:03.032
No time for pleasantries.

42:03.151 --> 42:04.684
You're in danger.

42:11.305 --> 42:13.430
Well, aren't you gonna
say something?

42:18.167 --> 42:19.302
Ziva.
