WEBVTT

00:00.051 --> 00:01.522
Come on!

00:05.384 --> 00:07.634
Really? So why French?

00:10.087 --> 00:12.259
You are still with us, Wilkinson?

00:12.330 --> 00:15.246
Well, I couldn't leave without
giving him a whipping first.

00:15.994 --> 00:17.356
- Ah!
- Yes!

00:17.357 --> 00:18.802
You were saying?

00:22.803 --> 00:24.968
- Oh dear.
- Yeah.

00:25.175 --> 00:27.843
Tension's still there.
I don't want to lose him.

00:28.519 --> 00:31.638
- And Costante, it's his sister?
- Yeah.

00:31.915 --> 00:33.473
No leads.

00:34.626 --> 00:36.850
This was a good idea
to have us for a drink.

00:36.851 --> 00:38.126
It's a good team.

00:38.127 --> 00:40.024
- Come on!
- I don't want it to break up.

00:40.065 --> 00:42.904
Teams like this stay together, despite, and

00:43.106 --> 00:45.684
sometimes because of adversity.

00:46.948 --> 00:50.579
_

00:51.183 --> 00:52.589
Can you turn this up, please?

00:52.590 --> 00:55.051
... players of both sides,
were filing down the tunnel,

00:55.067 --> 00:57.653
shortly after Legia's
victory this afternoon,

00:57.670 --> 00:59.426
when the explosion happened.

00:59.600 --> 01:02.778
The source of the blast
is, at this stage, unclear.

01:02.820 --> 01:06.533
But it's believed to have originated
from the home changing room.

01:06.550 --> 01:09.203
This is what we have from moments before.

01:09.704 --> 01:12.722
Fredi, how difficult has it been
to keep your mind on the football,

01:12.742 --> 01:14.441
with all the abuse you've received?

01:14.449 --> 01:15.768
It's been tough,

01:15.908 --> 01:17.266
I'm not gonna lie.

01:17.392 --> 01:19.315
We just keep playing our game, and

01:19.316 --> 01:22.232
hope people will see beyond
the color of our skin.

01:22.233 --> 01:24.954
Well, your all-action display
in mid-field would've hurt.

01:24.955 --> 01:27.349
Congratulations, you've
been named man of the match.

01:27.433 --> 01:30.706
Thank you, but I cannot accept
this. It's gotta go to my teammate.

01:30.733 --> 01:32.480
This is the real star here.

01:34.787 --> 01:36.917
Uh, one more question,
please. One more question.

01:37.037 --> 01:40.045
Er, do you feel Legia has turned
a corner with this recent victory?

01:40.089 --> 01:41.393
Yeah, yeah, I do.

01:41.513 --> 01:43.373
Uh, things are gonna be different now.

01:43.493 --> 01:45.913
- We're going up.
- Well, thank you and good luck.

01:45.932 --> 01:49.662
Well, Fredi and the team have played
like absolute champions today, and I...

01:53.067 --> 01:57.058
_

01:57.059 --> 02:03.381
_

02:03.382 --> 02:05.210
The bomb went off in their locker room.

02:05.240 --> 02:07.039
Manager and one player dead,

02:07.045 --> 02:10.541
six players injured, one... very seriously.

02:10.542 --> 02:13.423
Kalifa Konare, he lost
his leg above the knee.

02:13.770 --> 02:16.561
The local police are claiming are
claiming international terrorism,

02:16.562 --> 02:18.999
- which is where we fit in.
- Has anyone claimed it?

02:19.006 --> 02:20.878
- No.
- Police could be trying to deflect

02:20.879 --> 02:22.913
attention from the far-right element.

02:23.172 --> 02:25.638
Black players are abused
in grounds all over Europe.

02:25.639 --> 02:27.591
So, it might be racially motivated?

02:27.606 --> 02:29.096
Legia Lubin was recently bought

02:29.097 --> 02:31.730
by a Malaysian businessman,
named Victor Arshad.

02:31.735 --> 02:35.225
Foreign ownership of football
clubs in Poland is very unusual.

02:35.226 --> 02:38.079
And the fan base isn't
exactly crazy about the idea.

02:38.080 --> 02:39.397
Demonstrations,

02:39.398 --> 02:41.729
boycotts, the ultras have also been known

02:41.730 --> 02:45.105
to send death threats to both
Kalifa Konare and Fredi Diagho.

02:45.106 --> 02:47.039
They're recent signings from Mali.

02:47.040 --> 02:48.240
What are ultras?

02:48.361 --> 02:49.827
Hooligan fans,

02:49.836 --> 02:51.887
most of them are far-right activists.

02:51.888 --> 02:54.282
They look like a very nice group of people.

02:54.451 --> 02:57.868
These players from Mali are seen
as a symbol of Arshad's ownership.

02:57.894 --> 02:59.632
What do we know about the device?

02:59.663 --> 03:01.805
Luke and I are heading
down to talk to forensics,

03:01.817 --> 03:04.338
Marco and Arabela, head to the hospital.

03:04.339 --> 03:05.691
Let's figure this out.

_

03:40.735 --> 03:43.576
_

04:08.927 --> 04:11.362
People from here can't understand

04:11.380 --> 04:14.242
how such a tragedy has happened.

04:14.286 --> 04:18.265
My son is dead. They
have taken my little boy.

04:22.179 --> 04:25.079
The question on everybody's lips, is why?

04:35.816 --> 04:39.320
We're still waiting on frag and
chemical residue analysis, but right now,

04:39.321 --> 04:42.138
- they think it was a small pipe bomb.
- It makes sense.

04:42.139 --> 04:44.904
Probably made using
fertilizer as based explosive.

04:44.905 --> 04:46.875
It's crude, but effective at this range.

04:46.876 --> 04:49.459
- Any idea what the trigger was?
- They say it was a cellphone.

04:49.899 --> 04:52.332
Pipe bomb like this could
be triggered from anywhere.

04:52.558 --> 04:54.200
What's the security like here?

04:54.215 --> 04:56.758
Well, it was recently upgraded because of

04:56.786 --> 04:59.546
threats towards the Malian
players and the owner.

04:59.569 --> 05:02.112
Is there any entry logs,
any security footage?

05:02.113 --> 05:03.313
It's on its way.

05:03.515 --> 05:07.885
So, we have an explosive that anyone
with access to the internet can make,

05:07.908 --> 05:09.809
that could be triggered from anywhere.

05:10.004 --> 05:11.316
Loving those odds.

05:11.367 --> 05:14.219
A pipe bomb is usually
packed with ball bearings,

05:14.236 --> 05:16.055
nuts, and bolts.

05:16.665 --> 05:18.286
This one had glass in it.

05:18.287 --> 05:19.501
Is that weird?

05:20.089 --> 05:23.795
Well, glass doesn't show
up very well on x-rays, so,

05:23.811 --> 05:26.761
- that makes surgeries very hard.
- That's horrible.

05:27.379 --> 05:30.225
So, if this attack was racially motivated,

05:30.226 --> 05:31.469
isn't pipe bomb a little bit...

05:31.470 --> 05:32.916
- Indiscriminate?
- Right.

05:32.917 --> 05:34.704
Two white men dead as well.

05:34.721 --> 05:37.698
But the bomb was placed
in Kalifa Konare's locker.

05:38.747 --> 05:40.986
Maybe they misjudged the
size of the explosion.

05:41.003 --> 05:42.824
Or that he would survive.

05:47.520 --> 05:48.720
Mr. Diagho?

05:49.118 --> 05:50.842
I'm Inspector Marco Costante,

05:50.847 --> 05:52.903
with the International Criminal Court.

05:53.006 --> 05:54.799
Inspector Arabela Seeger.

05:55.068 --> 05:56.615
No more police.

05:57.343 --> 06:00.269
Mr. Diagho, we just want to
ask you a couple of questions

06:00.281 --> 06:01.959
regarding yesterday's events.

06:09.238 --> 06:12.164
The national police in Mali
are notoriously corrupt.

06:12.165 --> 06:14.071
He has no reason to trust us.

06:22.707 --> 06:24.689
You don't have to say anything.

06:25.656 --> 06:27.930
But if you want to, I'll be right here.

06:34.425 --> 06:36.017
It should have been me.

06:45.982 --> 06:48.090
What did they do, these animals?

06:50.284 --> 06:51.773
You will be looked after.

06:52.689 --> 06:54.733
Whatever he needs, and his family.

06:54.741 --> 06:56.574
You must be Mr. Arshad?

06:57.685 --> 07:00.708
Inspector Seeger and Costante from the ICC.

07:00.743 --> 07:02.678
We would just like to
ask a couple of questions.

07:03.051 --> 07:04.969
What is mine is at your disposal.

07:05.118 --> 07:06.318
Thanks.

07:08.279 --> 07:10.255
Go home. Get some rest.

07:11.263 --> 07:12.545
I'll stay with Kalifa.

07:13.949 --> 07:15.248
Yes, Arshad.

07:22.575 --> 07:24.505
Maybe we should step outside.

07:31.601 --> 07:32.896
It is my fault.

07:33.169 --> 07:35.064
For bringing them to this country.

07:35.466 --> 07:38.399
I sold them a dream of
a... civilized society.

07:38.402 --> 07:41.604
But these savages will never accept
us because we're a different color.

07:41.650 --> 07:44.113
You think this was a
racially motivated attack?

07:44.114 --> 07:45.314
What else?

07:46.106 --> 07:47.830
I brought my money to Poland

07:47.894 --> 07:50.581
to help Legia to get into
Europe, the Champion's League.

07:51.849 --> 07:53.414
Polish people I love,

07:53.683 --> 07:55.791
they welcome me, they welcome my family.

07:55.837 --> 07:57.555
But these... ultras,

07:57.675 --> 07:59.679
I do not even call them supporters,

07:59.748 --> 08:01.363
they're like a, disease.

08:06.477 --> 08:07.766
What a nerve.

08:09.086 --> 08:10.452
Do you know this man?

08:12.462 --> 08:14.134
Miroslaw Cena.

08:15.061 --> 08:18.211
The manager you fired shortly
after you bought the club?

08:18.686 --> 08:20.565
After 15 years of service.

08:20.667 --> 08:22.190
I had no choice.

08:22.478 --> 08:24.613
He is the ring leader of these ultras.

08:26.146 --> 08:27.431
Please,

08:27.753 --> 08:29.522
you find who did this.

08:29.661 --> 08:31.385
And bring them to justice.

08:31.617 --> 08:33.736
Oh, we intend to.

08:35.532 --> 08:37.147
It's always cold here.

08:37.658 --> 08:38.861
Where are you from?

08:38.861 --> 08:42.662
My father is from Nigeria,
but I grew up in Holland, so,

08:42.837 --> 08:44.057
I'm used to it.

08:44.280 --> 08:45.786
Could you go back to Mali?

08:47.212 --> 08:48.537
No, I could not.

08:49.417 --> 08:52.441
When my village heard I was
going to be a footballer in Europe

08:53.175 --> 08:55.690
it was the proudest
day in my father's life.

08:56.849 --> 08:59.898
To return as a failure would
bring disgrace to my family.

09:00.434 --> 09:02.026
You could change clubs.

09:02.303 --> 09:04.657
Maybe Spain or Italy.

09:05.137 --> 09:06.546
Maybe one day.

09:07.067 --> 09:09.404
I wait for Arshad to
tell me where to go next.

09:09.545 --> 09:11.200
Arshad doesn't own you.

09:11.201 --> 09:12.401
Yes.

09:13.241 --> 09:15.457
My registration belongs to him.

09:15.577 --> 09:18.275
It was not Legia who
bought me from AS Bamako,

09:18.276 --> 09:20.003
it was Arshad himself

09:20.123 --> 09:23.713
- who paid for the transfer fee.
- One man cannot own another.

09:25.051 --> 09:28.553
European clubs do not come
to Mali to look for players.

09:30.375 --> 09:32.312
Arshad gave me my dream.

09:33.077 --> 09:35.117
Without him I would have nothing.

09:37.202 --> 09:38.599
Turn in here.

10:13.239 --> 10:14.670
Miroslaw Cena?

10:15.039 --> 10:17.517
I'm Carine Strand, this
is Inspector Costante.

10:17.767 --> 10:19.878
Any budding Lewandowskis?

10:20.595 --> 10:23.012
Bonieks, that's who we
are really looking for.

10:30.584 --> 10:33.430
I've got coffee in my office. Please.

10:36.910 --> 10:38.648
Is this real?

10:39.058 --> 10:40.848
Boniek's shirt.

10:41.125 --> 10:43.049
I played with him, you know.

10:43.169 --> 10:45.089
You played with Zibì Boniek?

10:45.209 --> 10:48.078
Yeah, briefly at Widzew Lódz.

10:48.079 --> 10:51.216
You should have seen this guy.
He was... he was the fastest ever.

10:51.270 --> 10:53.890
At Juventus, they used to
call him Bello di notte.

10:53.911 --> 10:55.200
And today,

10:55.207 --> 10:58.286
one hundred million, just for his bad foot.

10:59.856 --> 11:02.211
How come you're no longer manager of Legia?

11:03.993 --> 11:05.607
How come...

11:06.139 --> 11:08.193
I left because of a...

11:10.440 --> 11:13.272
let's just say because of
a difference of opinion.

11:13.302 --> 11:16.947
And was this difference of
opinion with Victor Arshad?

11:16.961 --> 11:20.619
To do with your connection, to the
right-wing followers of the club?

11:20.820 --> 11:22.287
Is that what he told you?

11:22.323 --> 11:25.523
Well, he didn't have to. They're
still chanting your name at games.

11:25.552 --> 11:27.327
And what can I do about that?

11:28.894 --> 11:30.433
They're lunatics.

11:30.553 --> 11:33.411
But they love me because
they think I am like them.

11:33.812 --> 11:35.393
A Lubin boy... a

11:35.394 --> 11:37.606
small-town boy who became somebody.

11:37.621 --> 11:39.668
So you're denying that
your conflict with Arshad

11:39.682 --> 11:42.274
had anything to do with
the players from Mali?

11:42.281 --> 11:43.655
I don't deny shit.

11:43.677 --> 11:46.619
So you did have a problem
with Konare and Diagho.

11:46.640 --> 11:48.461
Damn right I had a problem.

11:48.774 --> 11:51.680
Because they were immigrants, because

11:51.702 --> 11:53.590
- they were black?
- Come on!

11:53.692 --> 11:55.859
Because fucking Arshad told me

11:55.860 --> 11:59.215
that I must select them
every game, no matter what!

11:59.216 --> 12:01.046
They both had to play?

12:01.401 --> 12:04.102
Even if their form was bad,
if other players were better?

12:04.109 --> 12:05.309
Right!

12:05.542 --> 12:08.012
So, I had to resign.

12:08.377 --> 12:10.453
I don't care if it's...

12:10.508 --> 12:13.500
Diagho, Boniek or Lionel Messi.

12:14.556 --> 12:16.968
The manager picks the team. Period.

12:17.464 --> 12:20.972
Otherwise, how do you look
your players in the eyes?

12:22.340 --> 12:23.575
Ah...

12:23.790 --> 12:26.782
This is more than football. Too much money.

12:26.783 --> 12:31.254
Too many suits thinking they know better
than people who live for this game.

12:33.177 --> 12:37.271
For Arshad, Legia is just a business deal.

12:37.802 --> 12:39.333
But for me,

12:39.700 --> 12:42.306
that club was my life.

12:43.100 --> 12:44.501
I would rather

12:45.041 --> 12:46.982
blow myself up.

12:49.650 --> 12:52.316
Why would Arshad play
the Malians in every game?

12:52.317 --> 12:55.284
If he puts them on display, would he
get more money when he sold them on?

12:55.285 --> 12:58.337
As a club owner, he'd profit from
the sale of any of his players.

12:59.628 --> 13:00.828
Ellie,

13:00.829 --> 13:03.614
I need you to look into Victor Arshad.

13:03.658 --> 13:05.981
Personal, business, whatever you can find.

13:09.288 --> 13:10.490
Sit.

13:14.554 --> 13:15.754
Djablani,

13:16.238 --> 13:17.652
from the Baobab tree.

13:18.082 --> 13:19.892
My mother sends it for strength.

13:20.977 --> 13:22.179
Thank you.

13:23.622 --> 13:25.079
I must check on Konare.

13:26.190 --> 13:27.392
Fredi,

13:28.541 --> 13:30.612
the bomb was found in Konare's locker,

13:30.613 --> 13:31.988
can you explain that?

13:33.729 --> 13:35.685
I understand that you're frightened,

13:36.230 --> 13:38.438
but if you know anything which could help,

13:38.722 --> 13:41.223
anything which is relevant,
you have to tell me.

13:41.978 --> 13:43.178
Fredi...

13:44.240 --> 13:45.442
Get down!

14:03.918 --> 14:07.542
Let's turn this monkey's trailer over!

14:12.273 --> 14:13.486
Hang on!

14:14.078 --> 14:16.140
Luke, I need your help!

14:19.012 --> 14:21.243
Luke, get here, now!

14:51.091 --> 14:52.827
Police, stop!

14:53.548 --> 14:54.751
Police!

14:55.746 --> 14:57.751
Hey! Stay down!

14:57.752 --> 14:58.952
Down!

15:00.503 --> 15:02.100
- You OK?
- Yeah.

15:02.101 --> 15:03.301
Oy!

15:03.649 --> 15:05.753
- What about the others?
- He'll do.

15:05.872 --> 15:07.570
He was calling the shots.

15:13.319 --> 15:15.452
- Are you hurt?
- No.

15:15.769 --> 15:17.165
They're gone. It's OK.

15:32.214 --> 15:33.416
Please.

15:34.396 --> 15:35.902
Can you take me to the hospital?

15:35.985 --> 15:38.079
- Konare is not so good.
- Of course.

15:41.555 --> 15:43.099
- Old school.
- What is?

15:43.100 --> 15:44.521
Powder residue.

15:44.994 --> 15:46.409
Gunpowder.

15:47.398 --> 15:48.905
What kind of glass is this?

15:49.436 --> 15:52.321
The same black glass surgeons
pulled out of the victims.

15:57.575 --> 15:59.004
- That's the bomb?
- Yeah.

15:59.005 --> 16:01.915
Someone must have swapped the real
bottle for this one during the game.

16:01.916 --> 16:04.028
Where's the man-of-the-match
champagne usually stored?

16:04.029 --> 16:05.559
In their broadcasting truck.

16:05.616 --> 16:07.186
In the executive car park.

16:07.997 --> 16:10.888
I've got CCTV... here.

16:11.760 --> 16:16.052
I've isolated and ID'd everyone who
passed through the executive entrance.

16:16.053 --> 16:20.160
They're mostly execs, business
men, no one of any interest, except

16:20.161 --> 16:21.859
Eddie Belka.

16:22.006 --> 16:24.648
He has a string of convictions
for stalking footballers

16:24.654 --> 16:27.425
including breaking and entrance
into a footballer's house.

16:27.545 --> 16:29.807
He has a Twitter ban,

16:29.819 --> 16:32.556
and is excluded from numerous
football clubs, including Legia.

16:32.557 --> 16:34.041
So, he shouldn't even
have been at the game.

16:34.042 --> 16:35.296
He probably got round the ban

16:35.297 --> 16:37.849
by paying ticket touts
through the nose for VIP seats.

16:37.850 --> 16:39.898
- Forward to Carine's address.
- Yeah.

16:41.325 --> 16:43.575
_

16:43.576 --> 16:46.536
_

16:48.120 --> 16:50.829
Do you think I should
wear black to the funeral?

16:50.949 --> 16:52.283
Or maybe, uh,

16:52.341 --> 16:53.944
a suit in Legia colours.

16:53.990 --> 16:56.538
- I think it's gonna be family only.
- Oh, they want me there.

16:56.658 --> 17:00.766
Mr. Belka, did you send a tweet
to the footballer, Fredi Diagho,

17:01.911 --> 17:03.320
"You make me sick.

17:03.321 --> 17:05.573
I hope you die in a fucking car crash."

17:05.574 --> 17:08.806
- I... I didn't mean it like that.
- But those are your words.

17:09.075 --> 17:11.412
Football. Football is pure emotion.

17:11.413 --> 17:13.486
- Right?
- But it can spill over into the unhealthy,

17:13.487 --> 17:16.250
like when you were banned from the English
grounds for attacking that linesman.

17:16.251 --> 17:18.846
Oh! Come on, lady, it was like

17:19.046 --> 17:21.433
ten yards off side, at least.

17:21.434 --> 17:23.719
And I was angry before... before the

17:23.720 --> 17:25.605
diagnosis, before the meds.

17:25.606 --> 17:27.536
- Oh.
- Uh, I... I'm good now.

17:27.563 --> 17:29.848
I'm... I'm good right now. I'm fine.

17:29.849 --> 17:31.229
Everything is like...

17:31.230 --> 17:33.155
uh... that day,

17:33.377 --> 17:34.643
Diagho,

17:34.700 --> 17:37.655
cost us derby against our local rival.

17:37.706 --> 17:40.168
He was sent off after seven minutes

17:40.204 --> 17:41.406
for a punch.

17:41.647 --> 17:43.061
That's why we lost.

17:43.181 --> 17:44.929
We lose, uh... 4:0.

17:44.930 --> 17:47.278
That's the problem with
these foreign players, huh?

17:47.279 --> 17:49.117
I mean, they just don't know what it means.

17:49.118 --> 17:51.631
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, you're fucking right.
- Huh?

17:51.895 --> 17:53.101
Last time I...

17:53.102 --> 17:55.209
I couldn't leave my house, like, for weeks.

17:55.210 --> 17:57.876
After that defeat. Do they hurt like this?

17:57.877 --> 18:01.635
You want... you want to show
them how it feels sometimes? Huh?

18:01.745 --> 18:06.184
You know, like how... how you feel,
what's the pain you're going through?

18:06.185 --> 18:07.733
You mean, like, uh,

18:07.994 --> 18:09.512
hurt a Legia player?

18:09.582 --> 18:14.229
Hey, if he's not giving everything for
the cause, why not? I mean, fuck him! Ha!

18:15.889 --> 18:18.054
- Are you high?
- Not right now, no.

18:18.077 --> 18:21.578
Once a man puts on the shirt,
he is my brother, for life!

18:21.588 --> 18:23.695
And you don't fuck with family!

18:23.736 --> 18:25.405
- Do you mind if I... please?
- No, no, no, no, no, no!

18:25.406 --> 18:26.621
- You can't!
- OK.

18:26.622 --> 18:28.169
You can't touch anything, please.

18:28.197 --> 18:29.738
- Take it easy. All right, look,
- Ah.

18:29.754 --> 18:31.212
putting it back. OK.

18:31.213 --> 18:32.644
- There you go.
- Ah.

18:32.794 --> 18:34.147
Can I take a photo?

18:35.252 --> 18:36.586
OK.

18:40.012 --> 18:43.145
This guy is no more a killer
than I am. We're wasting our time.

18:43.389 --> 18:44.611
Maybe.

18:45.039 --> 18:46.465
What are you thinking?

18:47.491 --> 18:49.489
Well, I'm not sure yet.

18:49.816 --> 18:52.651
But I know Sebastian is gonna love these.

18:52.652 --> 18:54.879
_

18:54.880 --> 18:57.298
_

19:00.991 --> 19:04.696
He tested negative for any
explosive residue. This is his file.

19:05.494 --> 19:08.470
It's a bit light for the leader
of a gang of football hooligans.

19:08.997 --> 19:10.727
Speeding violations.

19:10.728 --> 19:12.116
Does that strike you as odd?

19:16.631 --> 19:18.240
You're a real tough guy.

19:18.425 --> 19:21.489
A Nazi-sympathizing football hooligan

19:21.490 --> 19:25.024
who's comfortable with attacking a
player's home for the color of his skin.

19:25.025 --> 19:27.866
I just protect my country
from immigrant scum.

19:27.867 --> 19:29.939
And what a noble cause that is.

19:31.012 --> 19:34.176
Mercedes S Class. That's
a nice set of wheels.

19:34.271 --> 19:37.163
Now, I don't know very
much about cars, but,

19:37.283 --> 19:39.430
how much would a vehicle
like that set you back?

19:39.431 --> 19:42.397
Ninety, hundred thousand Euros?

19:42.454 --> 19:44.760
- Isn't that right, Artur ?
- It's not my car.

19:45.029 --> 19:48.671
It's strange that you've got no
records of working for Berlian Legia,

19:48.672 --> 19:50.232
and yet there you are.

19:50.233 --> 19:51.717
Driving their Merc.

19:51.763 --> 19:54.838
So, I do a little driving
work off the books.

19:55.046 --> 19:56.942
Arrest me for tax evasion.

19:58.275 --> 19:59.987
Or you can suck my dick.

19:59.988 --> 20:01.809
Such a beautiful language, isn't it?

20:01.810 --> 20:03.836
The passenger, who is he?

20:03.841 --> 20:05.285
- A client.
- Named?

20:05.663 --> 20:07.599
By the way, can I see your tattoos?

20:08.366 --> 20:11.191
Tattoos are mandatory for
the Legia ultras, right?

20:11.192 --> 20:13.578
Swastikas, Legia Lubin badges,

20:13.579 --> 20:16.310
- nationalist symbols.
- Yet, you're clean as a whistle.

20:16.842 --> 20:18.366
Fancy explaining that?

20:19.087 --> 20:20.287
It's a distraction.

20:20.288 --> 20:22.478
So, the attack on the caravan was a fake?

20:22.484 --> 20:24.592
No, the attack was real enough, but

20:24.593 --> 20:27.033
Slomski is no more a
right-wing activist than I am.

20:27.034 --> 20:30.687
He has no priors, no battle
scars, not even a stadium ban.

20:30.771 --> 20:32.483
Look at this photo of him here.

20:33.904 --> 20:35.748
So not only a distraction,

20:35.749 --> 20:38.578
a misdirection designed to
give us a credible alternative,

20:38.579 --> 20:41.128
- to the real bomber.
- Yeah, but who's doing the misdirecting?

20:41.129 --> 20:42.329
Who's that?

20:42.463 --> 20:43.832
He said a client.

20:43.833 --> 20:45.809
Did you get me anything on Victor Arshad?

20:45.810 --> 20:48.468
As much as I could. He
doesn't leave a trail.

20:51.801 --> 20:54.441
- Arabela, where are you?
- I'm at the hospital.

20:54.715 --> 20:56.485
Konare is in a very bad way.

20:56.491 --> 20:57.894
Did you get anything out of Diagho?

20:57.895 --> 21:00.932
I get the feeling he's hiding something.
He's just too scared to tell me.

21:01.049 --> 21:02.292
What does your instinct say?

21:02.293 --> 21:03.891
It's something about Arshad.

21:03.892 --> 21:07.459
He talks about him like he's this
great savior. I'm just not buying it.

21:07.678 --> 21:10.503
OK. We're on the same page.
We need something concrete.

21:10.504 --> 21:11.704
Understood.

21:12.054 --> 21:14.384
OK. Let's focus on Victor Arshad.

21:18.435 --> 21:19.713
I'm so sorry.

21:20.064 --> 21:21.264
We lost him.

21:21.543 --> 21:23.160
The other guy that was here,

21:23.274 --> 21:25.329
- where is he?
- He left.

21:25.467 --> 21:26.667
Thank you.

21:43.902 --> 21:48.133
Someone in your team has been
making inquiries about Victor Arshad.

21:48.134 --> 21:49.248
- Yes.
- Don't.

21:49.261 --> 21:51.920
Her Majesty's government
is using Arshad as a broker,

21:51.921 --> 21:53.529
for a multi-billion dollar

21:53.530 --> 21:55.404
Anglo-Malaysian trade deal.

21:55.405 --> 21:58.267
They can't have him sullied
by a criminal investigation.

21:58.268 --> 22:00.531
Well, I won't have my case
blocked by any government.

22:00.532 --> 22:03.740
- Oh, I'm not blocking anything.
- Doesn't sound like that to me.

22:03.741 --> 22:04.959
On the contrary.

22:05.206 --> 22:08.001
If you could find
something incontrovertible,

22:08.002 --> 22:09.221
there would be gratitude.

22:09.222 --> 22:11.579
Just don't make any noise
while you're doing it.

22:12.022 --> 22:14.377
Otherwise Arshad will hear it.

22:15.267 --> 22:17.954
- British government wants him too.
- I didn't say that.

22:17.955 --> 22:20.785
Well, he's obviously a big fish,

22:20.786 --> 22:24.442
and hard to catch, or this
trade deal wouldn't exist.

22:24.568 --> 22:26.429
You want us to do the dirty work

22:26.430 --> 22:28.389
but we still don't know if he's our guy.

22:29.025 --> 22:30.225
Give us something.

22:30.579 --> 22:32.050
Berlian Casino.

22:32.254 --> 22:35.743
We traced one of Arshad's holding
companies in the Cayman Islands

22:35.748 --> 22:39.043
to a controlling interest
in the Berlian Casino chain.

22:39.044 --> 22:42.229
- There's one in Lubin.
- Which is believed to be his European hub.

22:42.849 --> 22:45.371
But all his business is
done on encrypted lines

22:45.372 --> 22:47.449
- from a room in the casino.
- Encrypted how?

22:47.450 --> 22:49.351
You'd have to get inside to find out.

22:49.531 --> 22:50.855
But as I say,

22:50.856 --> 22:54.501
- go after Arshad...
- Go after Arshad carefully.

22:54.793 --> 22:57.162
And do no make any noise.

22:57.163 --> 22:59.259
Otherwise we will never see him again.

22:59.260 --> 23:01.835
And then it won't be
gratitude coming your way.

23:02.269 --> 23:04.527
This is Artur Slomski's signature.

23:04.648 --> 23:06.398
And... this

23:06.399 --> 23:08.808
is Artur Slomski's speeding violations.

23:09.488 --> 23:11.119
- Not Slomski.
- Nope.

23:11.239 --> 23:15.139
Most of the fines were paid by a
Dutch citizen by the name of Joep Mees.

23:15.259 --> 23:17.524
And guess where he was

23:17.900 --> 23:19.793
two hours before the bomb went off?

23:19.856 --> 23:23.172
- The executive area at Lubin stadium.
- Any motive for Mees?

23:23.173 --> 23:25.396
No causes, no activism,

23:25.397 --> 23:27.687
- he's low level.
- Anything to connect him with Arshad?

23:27.764 --> 23:30.454
- Arshad's a ghost. We got nothing on him.
- Yes, we do.

23:30.710 --> 23:33.668
Mees is security consultant
for a Berlian Casinos.

23:34.209 --> 23:35.409
Am I missing something?

23:35.410 --> 23:37.713
Arshad is the owner of
the Berlian Casinos Group.

23:37.714 --> 23:39.030
Amongst other things, according

23:39.031 --> 23:42.006
- to the British government.
- Could Arshad have employed them both?

23:42.007 --> 23:45.123
Mees to place the bomb, and
Slomski to create a diversion?

23:45.124 --> 23:46.324
Without motive?

23:46.325 --> 23:48.308
- It's purely circumstantial.
- But, w... w... w...

23:48.309 --> 23:50.253
why would Arshad kill his own players?

23:54.047 --> 23:55.275
Sebastian?

23:57.628 --> 23:59.386
Sebastian, are you there?

23:59.387 --> 24:01.592
I know exactly what Arshad's doing.

24:29.139 --> 24:30.479
Match fixing?

24:30.480 --> 24:32.773
Arshad's been using Diagho and Konare

24:32.774 --> 24:34.508
to influence events on the bench.

24:34.509 --> 24:38.554
And making millions through a gambling
syndicate stretching back to the Far East.

24:38.555 --> 24:40.583
And you're confident that these syndicates

24:40.584 --> 24:43.560
are placing bets on games
that Arshad has rigged?

24:43.660 --> 24:45.899
- Show him.
- I thought you'd never ask.

24:46.828 --> 24:49.170
Based on Belka's spreadsheets

24:49.175 --> 24:51.290
which are pretty much
works of art by the way...

24:51.296 --> 24:53.018
I had a feeling you were gonna say that.

24:53.894 --> 24:56.229
Legia Lubin aren't much going forward

24:56.235 --> 24:57.974
but their defense is solid.

24:57.975 --> 25:01.066
An average of 0.6 goals conceded per match.

25:01.067 --> 25:03.420
Their ratio would be even more impressive

25:03.825 --> 25:06.494
if it weren't for these three matches.

25:07.060 --> 25:10.724
- 4:0, 5:1...
- 6:0. Wow!

25:10.819 --> 25:12.397
Bad day at the office.

25:12.398 --> 25:14.275
But. what have these games got in common?

25:14.292 --> 25:16.616
- Diagho and Konare?
- Correct.

25:17.075 --> 25:20.304
Fredi Diagho was sent off
in all three heavy defeats.

25:20.305 --> 25:22.075
How come no one sees that as strange?

25:22.076 --> 25:23.528
Spread over a two-year period,

25:23.529 --> 25:26.032
it just looks like a player
with a red mist problem.

25:26.033 --> 25:27.341
Plenty of them around.

25:28.556 --> 25:30.624
But playing back in Mali,

25:31.875 --> 25:34.395
zero red cards in his entire career.

25:34.772 --> 25:38.518
Does one player being sent off the
pitch change the game that much?

25:38.519 --> 25:41.183
Considering each time it happened
within the first twenty minutes,

25:41.194 --> 25:43.768
it can. But the result
is not the only market.

25:43.773 --> 25:47.276
You can bet on anything. Goals,
scores, number of corners,

25:47.277 --> 25:48.689
time of the first throw-in.

25:48.690 --> 25:51.633
Or in this case, red cards
before half-time, and...

25:51.840 --> 25:53.849
- own goals.
- Konare.

25:53.850 --> 25:57.464
Two own goals in one of
these matches, one in another.

25:57.465 --> 25:59.522
Own goals are serious long odds,

25:59.523 --> 26:01.630
money in the bank, if
you know they're coming.

26:01.714 --> 26:04.405
Is there a way that we
can establish definitively

26:04.406 --> 26:06.646
that it is Arshad who's
putting the fix-in?

26:06.803 --> 26:10.145
I would have to cross-reference these
matches with the relevant betting patterns.

26:10.996 --> 26:12.197
Well...

26:16.871 --> 26:19.214
- Konare died.
- Shit.

26:19.385 --> 26:21.095
And Diagho's disappeared.

26:21.263 --> 26:24.144
I thought he might go to the
stadium, but I came up blank.

26:24.145 --> 26:26.454
- I'm worried he might do something stupid.
- Luke.

26:26.455 --> 26:27.803
You need to see this.

26:28.322 --> 26:30.467
- Hang on a minute.
- Yeah.

26:32.039 --> 26:34.002
This is the Berlian Casino.

26:37.658 --> 26:38.951
And what is that?

26:42.282 --> 26:44.298
You were right about his stupid.

26:44.861 --> 26:48.728
Over 1.5 million euros placed
via a betting exchanges on

26:48.732 --> 26:50.299
each of these matches.

26:50.300 --> 26:53.619
- And on the average Polish league game?
- 50,000...

26:53.837 --> 26:56.709
- max.
- So, Arshad buys these guys

26:56.710 --> 27:00.261
he controls their careers, and then
they have to do whatever he wants

27:00.262 --> 27:03.072
- during the game.
- Do we now have enough proof?

27:03.073 --> 27:08.446
No. We're talking thousands of small bets
placed all at the same time though proxies.

27:08.451 --> 27:11.240
And none of this ties into the bomb?

27:11.360 --> 27:12.610
We need more.

27:12.687 --> 27:13.986
Keep digging.

27:22.651 --> 27:24.908
- Let me go.
- What are you doing here, Fredi?

27:25.110 --> 27:26.792
What are you doing here?!

27:28.054 --> 27:29.477
Are you done?

27:33.501 --> 27:35.148
I thought you didn't know anything.

27:37.413 --> 27:39.496
I'm sorry about your friend,

27:39.959 --> 27:43.538
but you are about to ruin our
investigation and your life.

27:43.539 --> 27:45.488
- What life?
- Fredi!

27:53.202 --> 27:54.507
You know Mees?

27:56.908 --> 27:58.938
Is he the one fixing the matches?

28:00.373 --> 28:01.579
OK.

28:02.155 --> 28:04.282
You and me need to talk.

28:07.067 --> 28:09.386
_

28:09.387 --> 28:11.774
_

28:15.329 --> 28:17.581
Arshad told us the idea first.

28:18.470 --> 28:20.564
That we are to do what
he said on the pitch.

28:20.963 --> 28:22.728
Play against our teammates.

28:22.970 --> 28:25.214
- And you said...?
- No!

28:25.482 --> 28:26.912
Of course.

28:26.947 --> 28:28.784
Football is in my soul.

28:28.785 --> 28:31.928
I did not train my entire life
to betray the game like this.

28:31.929 --> 28:33.713
But eventually you did betray it.

28:36.352 --> 28:38.050
What did he do to persuade you?

28:38.916 --> 28:40.179
Arshad, nothing.

28:40.275 --> 28:41.475
Mees...

28:41.779 --> 28:43.379
he threatened us,

28:43.784 --> 28:45.154
our families,

28:45.488 --> 28:48.116
teammates. If we refuse,

28:48.250 --> 28:49.627
he will punish us.

28:51.416 --> 28:53.353
Me and Kalifa we say "OK".

28:53.919 --> 28:55.554
Legia is in the middle of the table,

28:55.555 --> 28:58.101
one game is not going to
change anything, up or down.

28:58.473 --> 28:59.960
But after the one game,

29:00.086 --> 29:02.839
Mees threatens to report us to UEFA.

29:04.036 --> 29:05.603
Life ban.

29:06.608 --> 29:08.600
Then we had to keep doing it.

29:08.802 --> 29:11.519
- Do you believe Mees is behind the bomb?
- Of course.

29:11.599 --> 29:13.145
What makes you so certain?

29:13.343 --> 29:15.387
This was one of the games.

29:16.128 --> 29:19.077
Kalifa was to get red card,
I was to give penalty away.

29:19.078 --> 29:20.305
Why didn't you?

29:20.858 --> 29:22.938
I looked at Kalifa in training,

29:23.394 --> 29:25.201
he could be something.

29:25.934 --> 29:27.453
Special, you know?

29:27.668 --> 29:30.522
Me, I'm OK, I get up and down, but him,

29:31.785 --> 29:33.876
this talent is a gift.

29:34.483 --> 29:37.212
And we were throwing it back in God's face.

29:38.141 --> 29:40.048
I say to him, "This is the end".

29:40.049 --> 29:41.794
"Today we play with honor."

29:43.319 --> 29:45.730
We told Arshad and Mees
we wouldn't do it anymore.

29:46.279 --> 29:47.489
When was this?

29:48.202 --> 29:49.406
Two days ago.

29:50.903 --> 29:53.954
- Arshad went crazy.
- Did he threaten you?

29:54.445 --> 29:57.505
- Mees did.
- But you played to win anyway?

29:57.676 --> 30:00.529
I didn't believe they
would go through with it.

30:02.017 --> 30:04.165
And now my teammates are dead.

30:04.842 --> 30:06.248
Because of me.

30:06.302 --> 30:09.054
Presumably, they meant
for you to die as well.

30:09.066 --> 30:12.295
I'm only alive because a
boy asked for my signature.

30:12.415 --> 30:14.520
After all Arshad's efforts,

30:14.521 --> 30:17.083
to bring you over from Mali,
and leveraging you into doing

30:17.095 --> 30:18.939
what he wants, why would he

30:19.492 --> 30:21.610
murder his prize assets?

30:22.448 --> 30:24.164
As a warning to the others.

30:24.272 --> 30:25.476
What others?

30:25.636 --> 30:28.496
Arshad owns many players at other clubs.

30:28.793 --> 30:30.348
All across Europe.

30:30.624 --> 30:32.336
Blackmails them too.

30:32.618 --> 30:36.150
If any were thinking of rebelling
against him, now they know what happens.

30:36.151 --> 30:38.153
What makes you so certain there are others?

30:38.154 --> 30:41.102
- Maybe he just wanted you to believe that.
- Arshad showed me.

30:42.897 --> 30:45.809
- In Mees' office.
- At the Berlian Casino?

30:45.815 --> 30:48.117
The little room with the big computers.

30:48.118 --> 30:51.713
They talk about the fixing
only in Mees' office.

30:52.428 --> 30:53.874
We watched another game.

30:54.120 --> 30:55.511
Serbian league.

30:56.502 --> 31:00.199
Arshad says "Watch, in five
minutes, there will be penalty."

31:01.198 --> 31:02.540
Five minutes,

31:02.912 --> 31:04.112
penalty.

31:04.750 --> 31:08.249
They are putting bets on, in
front of us, making so much money.

31:08.656 --> 31:11.799
Fredi, we wanna bring
a stop to all of this,

31:12.402 --> 31:16.026
and put Arshad and Mees
in prison for a long time.

31:16.985 --> 31:18.433
We need your help.

31:24.266 --> 31:26.566
Do you think there'll
ever be a German Bond?

31:28.446 --> 31:31.147
Berger. Sebastian Berger.

31:32.171 --> 31:34.001
That is the high roller room.

31:34.007 --> 31:35.960
Invitation only. And the only way

31:35.961 --> 31:38.665
into the secure room Arshad
uses for communications.

31:38.666 --> 31:40.210
We tapped into their system, but

31:40.211 --> 31:43.057
that room has its own
security which we can't crack.

31:43.122 --> 31:46.071
Mees is the only person
we've seen, in or out.

31:46.093 --> 31:49.454
So to get the access code, we need to
give him a reason to enter that room.

31:50.664 --> 31:53.371
Well, would you look
what the cat dragged in.

31:53.497 --> 31:56.520
The casino has 2,000 CCTV cameras

31:56.521 --> 31:58.046
and some motion sensors.

31:58.047 --> 32:00.090
Any nervousness will
be seen as card-counting

32:00.091 --> 32:03.179
- or collusion, and you will be ejected.
- And watch your back.

32:03.299 --> 32:06.004
Arshad didn't hesitate to blow
up a room full of athletes,

32:06.005 --> 32:08.238
he'll do anything to protect his empire.

32:09.070 --> 32:10.647
Excuse me for a minute.

32:12.900 --> 32:17.029
If Fredi's intelligence leads
us to a bust, can we do anything?

32:17.049 --> 32:18.639
He's facing a life ban.

32:18.716 --> 32:20.505
I'm sorry, I truly don't know.

32:21.730 --> 32:22.932
Yes.

32:25.754 --> 32:27.417
I shouldn't be the one doing this.

32:27.903 --> 32:29.229
I can't handle it.

32:29.230 --> 32:31.328
You are the only one
of us with the expertise

32:31.329 --> 32:33.406
to manage those encrypted lines.

32:33.617 --> 32:35.389
I can talk Luke through it.

32:35.390 --> 32:37.721
- Seriously, it's not that hard.
- No.

32:38.198 --> 32:40.591
It's not fair. You know me.

32:41.096 --> 32:43.698
I am a gambling man too, Berger.

32:44.571 --> 32:46.171
I am betting on you.

32:46.172 --> 32:48.839
- I believe you can.
- No, you don't.

32:50.014 --> 32:52.675
I can't go back to being
the gambling addict I was.

32:52.676 --> 32:54.701
You are not going to back, Berger.

32:54.739 --> 32:57.652
You're finally going beyond
your old self-centered life

32:57.653 --> 32:59.336
and your commitment to this new life

32:59.337 --> 33:01.908
gives you a strength
to do whatever you want.

33:03.822 --> 33:06.513
_

33:06.514 --> 33:09.323
_

33:23.814 --> 33:25.019
Thanks.

33:59.084 --> 34:00.284
Thank you, sir.

34:13.233 --> 34:15.206
And now the VIP room.

34:17.886 --> 34:19.192
Thank you, sir.

34:29.748 --> 34:30.947
That's it.

34:30.949 --> 34:32.503
The door to Mees' office.

34:38.168 --> 34:40.165
All we need now is the code.

34:51.016 --> 34:52.451
Shit.

34:55.464 --> 34:57.719
We need a clean view of that keypad.

34:58.183 --> 34:59.383
Move.

34:59.733 --> 35:02.032
Sebastian's got to get rid of this bloke.

35:14.232 --> 35:15.432
Come on.

35:15.841 --> 35:17.499
Take this guy out!

35:17.954 --> 35:19.154
Fold.

35:19.723 --> 35:20.923
What?

35:22.036 --> 35:23.551
What is he waiting for.

35:49.843 --> 35:51.070
Raise.

35:52.055 --> 35:54.294
Oh, that's a poker face.

36:05.323 --> 36:06.527
Boom.

36:07.216 --> 36:08.416
He knew.

36:08.494 --> 36:10.256
Carine, you're up.

36:16.749 --> 36:19.570
I need to speak with your
head of security, Joep Mees.

36:19.571 --> 36:21.630
This is Inspector Carine Strand.

36:22.243 --> 36:24.612
What it's about is a police matter.

36:24.613 --> 36:26.006
Put me through to him.

36:33.564 --> 36:34.764
Carry on.

36:39.825 --> 36:41.025
On his way.

36:49.800 --> 36:51.165
What is it?

36:52.908 --> 36:54.147
Did we get that?

36:55.702 --> 36:56.930
Look...

36:57.989 --> 37:00.573
Sebastian's camera is also heat sensitive.

37:00.574 --> 37:02.519
It's just a matter of
watching the faint pattern.

37:02.520 --> 37:03.825
Snazzy.

37:04.369 --> 37:05.747
One, four...

37:09.577 --> 37:11.327
Mr. Mees, I did you the courtesy

37:11.328 --> 37:14.858
of not embarrassing you by flashing
my badge in front of your customers.

37:14.859 --> 37:17.201
Meet me outside the casino. Now.

37:17.202 --> 37:18.594
I'm not asking.

37:38.344 --> 37:39.544
Ah...

37:40.358 --> 37:41.585
VIP card.

37:41.877 --> 37:43.077
- VIP card?
- Yes.

37:43.078 --> 37:45.883
- Yeah, sure.
- Marco plays a convincing drunk.

37:49.629 --> 37:52.860
VIP card. Frigging cards.

37:56.414 --> 37:58.963
You know what? I don't need
a VIP card. Know what I need?

37:58.964 --> 38:00.701
- The VIP card?
- Yeah, OK.

38:00.833 --> 38:03.074
And that's how you run interference.

38:04.811 --> 38:06.011
Yeah.

38:07.167 --> 38:10.009
OK, OK. No VIP card... c...

38:10.045 --> 38:12.493
- Just... come on, guys. I mean guys.
- Think about it.

38:12.494 --> 38:13.799
Come on. Hey!

38:14.629 --> 38:17.046
1-4-0-4-1-9-9-1.

38:32.304 --> 38:34.363
Joep Mees, what can I do for you?

38:34.616 --> 38:36.769
The European Gaming Commission
has reason to believe

38:36.770 --> 38:40.490
that your casino is employing staff
known to have a criminal record.

38:40.541 --> 38:43.249
We run scrupulous background
checks on all our employees.

38:43.250 --> 38:45.076
Oh, not scrupulous enough.

38:55.644 --> 38:56.957
Are you aware,

38:57.039 --> 38:59.517
that two of your croupiers are working

38:59.618 --> 39:01.564
under assumed names?

39:15.310 --> 39:20.738
_

39:20.739 --> 39:21.939
Scheiße!

39:22.508 --> 39:26.075
This could lead to a termination
of your casino license.

39:26.101 --> 39:27.922
I'm sure it has been just a mistake.

39:27.939 --> 39:30.325
I'm equally certain there has not been.

39:30.445 --> 39:34.340
If this is not rectified, your
casino will face substantial fines.

39:34.564 --> 39:36.090
Possibly closure.

39:37.421 --> 39:38.778
_

39:40.389 --> 39:43.560
_

39:43.561 --> 39:45.765
Well, let me look into it,
and I'll get back to you.

39:45.902 --> 39:47.668
He's still at it, keep Mees there.

39:47.669 --> 39:48.970
Mr. Mees,

39:48.971 --> 39:51.188
did I tell you this conversation was over?

39:54.359 --> 39:55.559
Do you have the card?

39:55.560 --> 39:56.919
- Do I have a card?
- Yeah.

39:57.029 --> 39:58.398
- To give him.
- Your... your card?

39:58.399 --> 40:00.236
- Yes.
- No, my card.

40:00.549 --> 40:02.883
- It... yeah?
- A number of cards...

40:03.042 --> 40:04.502
- Um...
- Oh God.

40:04.503 --> 40:06.470
- No, no, wait, wait.
- No, no, it's fine. I...

40:06.590 --> 40:09.088
Arabela, they can't hold him. Go.

40:28.405 --> 40:29.758
Fine.

40:31.827 --> 40:34.734
- Sebastian, get out of there.
- Time to go, mate.

40:35.424 --> 40:36.909
Just a little longer.

40:36.910 --> 40:38.194
No, we're out of time.

40:38.195 --> 40:39.312
_

40:39.313 --> 40:40.513
Got it!

40:41.691 --> 40:45.084
Oh my... oh, shit! Sorry, sorry.

40:45.085 --> 40:46.499
- Whoa. No, no, are you OK, man?

40:46.500 --> 40:48.467
- I'm so sorry. I'm a little drunk, yeah.
- Get this guy out of here.

40:48.468 --> 40:50.125
You know, it's OK. Hey!

40:55.636 --> 40:56.898
Hey, how are you?

40:56.899 --> 40:58.432
- Fine, I'm fine. Yeah.
- Do you wanna have a drink?

40:58.433 --> 41:00.374
- Maybe later. OK. Bye.
- OK.

41:10.813 --> 41:12.047
What are you doing?

41:12.809 --> 41:15.235
- Is this not the toilet?
- It's over there.

41:31.753 --> 41:32.953
Hey.

41:33.207 --> 41:35.478
I think we can run it
a bit closer next time.

41:36.285 --> 41:37.485
What?

41:39.000 --> 41:40.200
Oh.

41:40.629 --> 41:44.449
I... uh, scrambled the signals
in case anyone was listening.

41:44.450 --> 41:45.741
What'd we get?

41:46.104 --> 41:49.745
Cameras, audio, and every
keystroke they input comes

41:49.746 --> 41:51.223
directly to us.

41:51.224 --> 41:53.689
So, if they incriminate themselves,

41:53.770 --> 41:55.410
we will have them.

41:57.951 --> 42:00.642
_

42:07.693 --> 42:08.954
_

42:08.955 --> 42:10.197
What's so urgent?

42:10.198 --> 42:12.120
Diagho has gone to the police.

42:17.385 --> 42:19.823
That piece of shit should be dead.

42:21.275 --> 42:22.743
- Wow.
- Yeah.

42:22.843 --> 42:24.613
They've nothing but his word.

42:25.772 --> 42:28.066
The match proceeds tonight as planned.

42:44.116 --> 42:46.937
Is this a good time to talk
about me getting a raise?

42:47.388 --> 42:50.117
_

42:50.118 --> 42:52.465
_

42:55.544 --> 42:57.701
- Come on!
- Maybe you're just not very good

42:57.703 --> 42:58.903
- at this game.
- Yes!

42:58.905 --> 43:00.853
All right, Delfont-Bogard.

43:00.854 --> 43:02.886
You and me. It's on.

43:03.454 --> 43:04.654
Show him.

43:07.411 --> 43:10.408
They say that adversity
brings a team together.

43:10.672 --> 43:12.253
Something like that.

43:13.663 --> 43:14.907
I give up.

43:15.458 --> 43:18.228
- Straight to the bar.
- Oh, come on. Rematch.

43:20.607 --> 43:22.429
Thanks, for the belief.

43:22.430 --> 43:23.630
All right, my turn.

43:23.726 --> 43:25.728
It was all down to you, Berger.

43:26.706 --> 43:28.799
Have you told young Erik yet?

43:29.370 --> 43:32.192
- No.
- Well you must do. You must.

43:32.421 --> 43:35.868
Sons love to hear about
their fathers heroic exploits.

43:35.938 --> 43:37.203
I will.

43:38.605 --> 43:41.470
Jan, could you turn it up, please?

43:42.006 --> 43:44.955
Club owner, Victor
Arshad, was today arrested

43:44.956 --> 43:48.861
as the mastermind of a pan-European
match fixing syndicates.

43:49.309 --> 43:52.687
Arshad was thought to have fixed
the outcome of hundreds of matches,

43:52.688 --> 43:55.056
and to be behind the
bombing of Legia stadium,

43:55.057 --> 43:57.935
which injured sixteen, and
killed controversial player

43:57.936 --> 43:59.531
Kalifa Konare.

44:10.192 --> 44:11.392
Why are we here?

44:11.399 --> 44:14.737
It's still under review, but
we have enough evidence to prove

44:14.738 --> 44:17.931
to UEFA that you were severely coerced.

44:18.697 --> 44:20.693
And we're pushing for their leniency.

44:20.694 --> 44:23.442
And in the meantime, there's
somebody you should talk to.

44:23.443 --> 44:25.096
Legia's new manager.

44:26.724 --> 44:27.924
Thank you.

44:28.088 --> 44:29.706
I will honor Kalifa.

44:32.453 --> 44:33.653
Thank you.

44:39.146 --> 44:40.346
Thank you.
