01:26.687 --> 01:28.589
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.

01:29.523 --> 01:30.724
Now, now, listen..

01:30.757 --> 01:32.358
...I‐I‐I want to

01:32.392 --> 01:33.694
to make an announcement.

01:33.727 --> 01:36.530
This is a very important
birthday for me.

01:36.563 --> 01:39.600
And not even
Cousin Larry knows why?

01:39.633 --> 01:42.235
Because today
not only I turn 25

01:42.268 --> 01:45.506
but according to
Mypos tradition..

01:45.539 --> 01:47.741
...I also
become a man.

01:51.411 --> 01:53.146
Wow, what were you before?

01:56.216 --> 01:57.718
I was 24.

02:00.320 --> 02:01.588
[knocking on door]

02:01.622 --> 02:02.689
I'll get it.

02:07.260 --> 02:09.362
I'm looking
for Balki Bartokomous.

02:09.395 --> 02:10.896
I am Balki Bartokomous.

02:10.931 --> 02:11.865
Come in.

02:13.366 --> 02:15.536
I am Verbos Verazonns..

02:15.569 --> 02:16.937
...from the island of Pathos.

02:16.970 --> 02:19.372
Pathos. From Pathos.

02:19.405 --> 02:21.808
Everybody, he‐he is from Pathos.

02:21.842 --> 02:24.845
Pathos‐Pathos, is the‐is the
island that is the neighbor

02:24.878 --> 02:27.948
of Mypos to the east
and Skeptos is to the west

02:27.981 --> 02:30.350
and all together they form
the Tri‐Island Area.

02:37.891 --> 02:40.360
So you're from Pathos.

02:40.393 --> 02:42.395
It's funny,
you don't look pathetic.

02:44.698 --> 02:47.333
Well, only my father
is from Pathos.

02:47.367 --> 02:48.869
My mother was born
in Skeptos.

02:48.902 --> 02:50.436
Oh.

02:50.470 --> 02:53.239
Oh! Yeah, yeah, now I see..

02:53.273 --> 02:56.376
...yeah, the nose and the mouth
are definitely pathetic.

02:59.412 --> 03:00.914
And those eyes..

03:00.947 --> 03:02.949
...those are the eyes
of a skeptic.

03:04.885 --> 03:06.620
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

03:06.653 --> 03:07.988
‐ Oh, your welcome.
‐ Thank you.

03:08.021 --> 03:09.489
‐ Don't mention.
‐ Thank you.

03:09.523 --> 03:10.490
‐ Don't mention.
‐ Thank you.

03:10.524 --> 03:11.592
Don't mention.

03:14.961 --> 03:17.698
Yes, but the reason I've
traveled all this way..

03:17.731 --> 03:19.800
...I brought you birthday
present from your mother.

03:19.833 --> 03:21.602
Birthday present
from mama?

03:25.706 --> 03:26.707
Here's cookie for you.

03:26.740 --> 03:28.474
[gasping]

03:28.509 --> 03:29.442
A moo koo cookie!

03:30.977 --> 03:33.947
She sent a guy five thousand
miles to bring him a cookie?

03:35.916 --> 03:37.851
Balki Bartokomous..

03:37.884 --> 03:40.854
...in honor of
your 25th birthday..

03:40.887 --> 03:42.823
[speaking in foreign language]

03:42.856 --> 03:45.659
...allow me to present
Kiki Karadopolis..

03:49.395 --> 03:49.996
...your bride to be.

03:50.030 --> 03:51.965
[coughing]

04:02.976 --> 04:04.344
Cousin..

04:04.377 --> 04:06.446
...I got Kiki and Verbos

04:06.479 --> 04:07.848
settled into the hotel.

04:07.881 --> 04:10.383
Oh, good.
And you got Mary Anne flowers.

04:10.416 --> 04:11.952
She was really upset.
That'll make her feel better.

04:20.560 --> 04:23.363
‐ What're you doing?
‐ These are for tomorrow.

04:23.396 --> 04:25.331
The bride has to walk
down an aisle

04:25.365 --> 04:26.867
littered with flower petals.

04:28.101 --> 04:29.736
Whoa, hold it.

04:29.770 --> 04:31.304
What bride?
What littered aisle?

04:31.337 --> 04:32.606
What are you talking about?

04:32.639 --> 04:34.741
I'm talking about
the Karadopolis‐Bartokomous

04:34.775 --> 04:36.677
wedding with reception
immediately following.

04:38.745 --> 04:41.682
I thought we'd put like three
rows of chairs right here..

04:41.715 --> 04:43.850
...and, uh, the altar
over there and..

04:43.884 --> 04:45.418
W‐w‐wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

04:45.451 --> 04:46.920
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

04:46.953 --> 04:47.988
You mean you're going
through with this.

04:49.389 --> 04:50.924
Cousin, it's a done deal.

04:54.528 --> 04:56.062
The goat has already
been delivered.

04:59.800 --> 05:01.635
Goat?
What goat?

05:01.668 --> 05:04.104
It's the standard,
short‐form

05:04.137 --> 05:05.972
inter‐island
marriage agreement.

05:06.006 --> 05:08.942
I get a bride and Kiki's father
gets a goat.

05:08.975 --> 05:11.344
Now...I thought..

05:11.377 --> 05:12.746
...what I would do
let me just see

05:12.779 --> 05:13.914
'cause these things
are on sale..

05:13.947 --> 05:14.981
...I want to just..

05:15.015 --> 05:16.016
...strew a little bit..

05:16.049 --> 05:17.117
‐ Yeah, uh..
‐ And just get..

05:17.150 --> 05:19.052
Oh, this works good.

05:19.085 --> 05:21.354
And then, I thought
this would be a good place

05:21.387 --> 05:23.657
to put the traditional..

05:23.690 --> 05:25.559
...Myposian..

05:25.592 --> 05:27.528
...bull.

05:27.561 --> 05:28.995
Alright, alright, Balki..

05:29.029 --> 05:30.897
...I've had it
with traditional Myposian bull.

05:34.167 --> 05:36.369
Are you telling me
you're happy

05:36.402 --> 05:37.871
marrying a woman
you don't even know?

05:37.904 --> 05:39.740
Well, cousin,
she seemed very pleasant

05:39.773 --> 05:41.107
on the way to the hotel.

05:41.141 --> 05:44.578
Are you happy marrying a woman
you don't even know?

05:44.611 --> 05:47.914
Cousin, ah, uh, I‐I'm gonna
get to know her.

05:47.948 --> 05:50.383
We have years and years
and years ahead of us.

05:50.416 --> 05:52.018
But are you happy?

05:52.052 --> 05:53.654
‐ Yes, I'm happy.
‐ You're happy?

05:53.687 --> 05:54.688
‐ I'm happy.
‐ You're happy?

05:54.721 --> 05:55.689
‐ I'm happy.
‐ You're happy?

05:55.722 --> 05:57.791
I'm happy!
I'm happy! I'm happy!

06:01.628 --> 06:03.029
No, I'm not happy!

06:04.531 --> 06:06.767
This marriage is gonna change
everything!

06:06.800 --> 06:09.169
I'm gonna have to move out
and get another place to live

06:09.202 --> 06:10.971
and I'll have to get
a second job

06:11.004 --> 06:12.973
and Mary Anne and I
will have to stop dating.

06:15.208 --> 06:17.744
I‐I'd rather have my arms
cut off at the knees

06:17.778 --> 06:18.812
than go through with this.

06:18.845 --> 06:21.114
Okay. Alright.
Good. Good. Good.

06:21.147 --> 06:23.617
I'm glad we got that
out in the open.

06:23.650 --> 06:25.952
Now, tomorrow morning..

06:25.986 --> 06:27.721
...I'll go down to the hotel
and talk to Kiki.

06:27.754 --> 06:30.423
Tell her thanks,
but no thanks

06:30.456 --> 06:32.926
and get them on the next plane
to the Tri‐Island Area.

06:32.959 --> 06:35.529
Cousin, I‐I got to marry Kiki.

06:35.562 --> 06:37.798
What? Wait...why?

06:37.831 --> 06:38.632
We were doing so well
here for a moment.

06:38.665 --> 06:39.800
There was a connection.

06:39.833 --> 06:41.502
‐ It‐it was meaningful.
‐ Yeah, totally.

06:41.535 --> 06:43.103
‐ It was succinct.
‐ I got to..

06:43.136 --> 06:44.838
I‐I got to..

06:44.871 --> 06:47.473
...explain something to you.
You've got to understand this.

06:47.508 --> 06:48.809
First..

06:48.842 --> 06:51.745
...I could never go
against mama's wishes.

06:51.778 --> 06:55.549
And second, if‐if I don't
marry...Kiki..

06:55.582 --> 06:56.717
...she will be disgraced.

06:56.750 --> 06:59.052
No other man
will ever have her.

06:59.085 --> 07:01.487
And she will have to walk
through the streets of Pathos

07:01.522 --> 07:02.989
wearing the scarlet letter.

07:05.158 --> 07:06.760
The scarlet letter.

07:06.793 --> 07:08.762
"R."

07:08.795 --> 07:09.930
For returned.

07:13.900 --> 07:15.569
Balki, isn't there anything
you can do

07:15.602 --> 07:16.670
to get out
of this wedding?

07:17.671 --> 07:19.640
Well, I remember when

07:19.673 --> 07:22.108
Depozipol Epopaloo got out
of his pre‐arranged marriage

07:22.142 --> 07:23.577
to Mitchiboomba.

07:24.778 --> 07:27.080
Well, great!
What did he do?

07:27.113 --> 07:28.882
Well, the ground opened up
and swallowed him.

07:30.617 --> 07:32.052
But..

07:32.085 --> 07:34.588
...cousin, unless we have
an eight point five earthquake

07:34.621 --> 07:36.790
between now and tomorrow..

07:36.823 --> 07:38.759
...I'll be a married man.

07:40.627 --> 07:42.563
[instrumental music]

07:46.967 --> 07:49.536
[instrumental music]

07:54.641 --> 07:56.009
(Lydia)
Let me get this straight.

07:56.042 --> 07:57.711
Balki is marrying someone

07:57.744 --> 07:59.913
he's only known
for 16 hours?

07:59.946 --> 08:01.515
That's right.

08:01.548 --> 08:02.549
Wh‐what‐what is this?

08:02.583 --> 08:04.050
A whirlwind romance?

08:04.084 --> 08:05.886
No, a birthday present.

08:07.120 --> 08:08.722
Wow.

08:08.755 --> 08:10.490
I only got him cologne.

08:12.659 --> 08:15.929
Well, you see,
she came from Pathos, and..

08:15.962 --> 08:17.831
I'll explain it
to her, baby.

08:17.864 --> 08:18.932
Thanks.

08:24.037 --> 08:25.772
Balki, we're almost ready.

08:32.613 --> 08:34.179
What...what is it?
What's wrong?

08:36.015 --> 08:38.552
No, no, y‐y‐you look fine.

08:38.585 --> 08:40.654
Just you look like
you're about to lead

08:40.687 --> 08:42.222
the Charge of the Light Brigade.

08:45.058 --> 08:46.960
It's the sword,
isn't it?

08:46.993 --> 08:48.128
Well, no really

08:48.161 --> 08:50.230
it's everything.

08:50.263 --> 08:53.199
But the sword
is a big part of it.

08:53.233 --> 08:56.302
Well, it's‐it's a traditional
Myposian wedding saber.

08:58.004 --> 09:00.240
Is it a Myposian
cultural symbol

09:00.273 --> 09:02.342
of honor and courage?

09:02.375 --> 09:04.110
No, we use it
on the wedding night

09:04.144 --> 09:05.879
to keep the sheep
off the bed.

09:14.187 --> 09:15.622
Of course, uh..

09:17.257 --> 09:19.893
...listen, uh..

09:19.926 --> 09:21.227
...Balki..

09:21.261 --> 09:23.063
...there's something
I wanna..

09:23.096 --> 09:24.230
...tell you.

09:25.365 --> 09:26.800
Cousin..

09:26.833 --> 09:30.103
...if this is about
the birds and the bees..

09:30.136 --> 09:31.838
...I‐I already know it.

09:34.207 --> 09:35.876
You learn a lot
from watching sheep.

09:40.981 --> 09:43.316
Although if they catch you
watching they come after you.

09:45.185 --> 09:47.120
They‐they come after you.

09:48.822 --> 09:52.993
No, no, it's, uh,
it's nothing like that, I..

09:53.026 --> 09:55.762
...before you go off
to start your new life

09:55.796 --> 09:58.264
I just wanted to say goodbye.

10:02.435 --> 10:03.336
I don't want to
say goodbye.

10:03.369 --> 10:05.906
Oh, please, Balki,
don't make this any harder

10:05.939 --> 10:07.774
than it already is.

10:07.808 --> 10:10.176
You know I‐I have
trouble expressing..

10:13.379 --> 10:15.315
‐ Emotion.
‐ Right.

10:17.250 --> 10:19.853
It's just over
the last three years

10:19.886 --> 10:21.622
you've become my..

10:23.857 --> 10:25.826
‐ Closest...friend.
‐ Right.

10:28.729 --> 10:31.031
And when you showed up
on my doorstep

10:31.064 --> 10:32.733
you just made me..

10:32.766 --> 10:33.767
‐ Feel.
‐ So..

10:33.800 --> 10:34.868
Needed.

10:39.305 --> 10:41.141
You know,
I'm‐I'm really gonna

10:41.174 --> 10:42.242
m‐m‐m..

10:44.044 --> 10:45.712
Miss me.

10:45.746 --> 10:48.081
And I'm going to
miss you too, cousin.

10:57.791 --> 10:59.292
That wasn't so hard
to say.

10:59.325 --> 11:01.327
I guess I really opened up.

11:03.329 --> 11:05.131
[knocking on door]

11:07.133 --> 11:08.702
Larry, that surprise is ready.

11:08.735 --> 11:10.103
Oh.

11:10.136 --> 11:11.271
Balki, I have a..

11:11.304 --> 11:13.339
...wedding present for you.

11:13.373 --> 11:16.076
I called Mypos and had them
get your mama on the phone

11:16.109 --> 11:17.878
so that she could listen
to the wedding ceremony.

11:19.145 --> 11:21.214
Oh, cousin..

11:21.247 --> 11:23.183
...only you would have thought
of a present

11:23.216 --> 11:25.218
as wonderful as that.

11:25.251 --> 11:27.087
Thank you.

11:27.120 --> 11:29.990
Well, I'd better go say,
"Dazu o do yo yay" to mama.

11:35.361 --> 11:36.429
I will pack my things

11:36.462 --> 11:38.131
so that I may leave
after the wedding.

11:41.134 --> 11:43.269
Well, I guess you'll be happy
to get back to Pathos.

11:48.141 --> 11:50.243
I don't think
I'll ever be happy again.

11:53.514 --> 11:55.348
Is something wrong?

11:58.885 --> 12:00.386
I'm in love with Kiki.

12:02.355 --> 12:04.290
Verbos, that's great.

12:05.926 --> 12:08.394
No, it's terrible.

12:08.428 --> 12:10.130
I'm in love
with another man's wife!

12:10.163 --> 12:11.765
Not yet, she's not.

12:11.798 --> 12:14.400
Because, we‐we can still
call off this stupid wedding.

12:14.434 --> 12:18.071
No, we can't call off
this stupid wedding.

12:18.104 --> 12:19.973

You're in love with Kiki!

12:21.441 --> 12:22.843
Yes.

12:22.876 --> 12:25.812
But, she's not in love
with me.

12:25.846 --> 12:28.148
Just tell me if this
headpiece is too tight.

12:28.181 --> 12:30.050
I want to die.

12:30.083 --> 12:32.418
I'll loosen it.

12:32.452 --> 12:34.387
The headpiece is fine.

12:35.488 --> 12:37.223
My life is miserable.

12:39.159 --> 12:41.995
Well, if it makes
you feel any better.

12:42.028 --> 12:43.830
Balki is one
of the finest human beings

12:43.864 --> 12:45.465
on the face of the earth.

12:45.498 --> 12:48.201
I'm sure he is fine.

12:48.234 --> 12:51.371
But, I am in love with Verbos.

12:51.404 --> 12:52.939
Kiki, this is wonderful!

12:52.973 --> 12:56.242
Now, we can call off
this stupid wedding!

12:56.276 --> 12:58.378
No, we can't.

12:58.411 --> 13:00.180
It's too late for me
to tell Verbos

13:00.213 --> 13:02.983
how I feel about him.

13:03.016 --> 13:05.085
But, I don't understand.

13:05.118 --> 13:07.954
Why is it too late
to tell Verbos how you feel?

13:07.988 --> 13:10.423
He may feel
the same way about you.

13:10.456 --> 13:13.193
[sighing]
He doesn't even know
I'm alive.

13:13.226 --> 13:15.295
If I told him how I feel

13:15.328 --> 13:18.599
I would only be rejected
and humiliated

13:18.632 --> 13:20.300
and then I would have
to throw myself

13:20.333 --> 13:22.268

‐ Balki.

13:41.254 --> 13:44.858
Um...Mary Anne,
I want you to know

13:44.891 --> 13:47.093
that even though
I'm marrying Kiki

13:47.127 --> 13:49.229
it will take me..

13:49.262 --> 13:52.866
...years and years
before I can begin

13:52.899 --> 13:55.569
to feel about her the way
I already feel about you.

14:02.342 --> 14:06.112
Mary Anne, I'm so sorry
that you've been hurt.

14:06.146 --> 14:09.149
Maybe it would have been better
if I never come to America.

14:09.182 --> 14:11.251
Oh, Balki, don't say that.

14:11.284 --> 14:13.520
I'm glad you came to America.

14:13.554 --> 14:16.056
If you hadn't,
I never would have met you.

14:16.089 --> 14:19.292
I don't regret a thing...except
maybe this marriage business.

14:23.697 --> 14:26.299
Do you think that
we can still be friends?

14:29.035 --> 14:30.571
Of course,
we can still be friends.

14:39.680 --> 14:41.147
Come on, Mary Anne.

14:41.181 --> 14:43.383
I'll‐I'll get you

You can sit right up in front.

you must be the groom?

Thank you for coming
on such short notice.

would kill him

15:26.159 --> 15:27.694
we decided to go
with someone local.

Well, you're not to worry.
I think I can handle it.
