00:01.419 --> 00:05.173
Today is the test launch
day for the inaugural Sabre store.

00:06.591 --> 00:10.637
And I, Dwight Schrute, am in
charge of the entire operation.

00:10.929 --> 00:13.723
If I can prove myself today and the
store is a hit with the media,

00:13.807 --> 00:17.602
and Nellie sees this,
the vice presidency is mine.

00:17.686 --> 00:18.853
Hey, are you
holding this chair?

00:18.937 --> 00:20.313
Because I feel like
I'm going to fall off.

00:20.397 --> 00:22.023
Yeah. Yes. Yes. I'm not wearing
the right shoes for this.

00:22.107 --> 00:23.191
We went
over this, okay?

00:23.274 --> 00:24.734
Your tiny fingers
make the best knots.

00:25.110 --> 00:28.279
Hey, strangers. I'm so stoked
for the Sabre store opening.

00:32.325 --> 00:35.328
Hey, my name's Tabitha. I'm camped
out in front of the Sabre store

00:35.412 --> 00:37.789
so I can be first in line
for the new Pyramid.

00:38.540 --> 00:39.582
Psst!

00:39.666 --> 00:42.544
It's me, Erin. Dwight had
me pretend to be a hipster

00:42.627 --> 00:44.003
to create hype
and it's working.

00:44.087 --> 00:46.631
There's already people
camped out behind me.

01:00.812 --> 01:02.355
Test launch day, people.

01:02.480 --> 01:07.068
Now, I would like to fill you
in on a little secret about me.

01:07.402 --> 01:08.903
To inspire you today.

01:08.987 --> 01:12.323
Now I know you probably all think
I'm this patrician goddess.

01:12.407 --> 01:14.325
But here's the truth.

01:14.659 --> 01:17.454
I was born in the little
working-class town of Basildon,

01:18.163 --> 01:19.998
and until the age of 32,

01:20.081 --> 01:21.541
I talked like this.

01:21.624 --> 01:24.043
Which was
bloody horrendous, innit?

01:24.461 --> 01:28.006
I came from dirt.
No, lower than...

01:28.590 --> 01:29.799
What's lower than dirt?

01:29.883 --> 01:32.510
Loam. Magma. Mantle.
Outer core. Inner core.

01:32.594 --> 01:36.431
Yeah, thank you. Loam.
Bloody loam I came from.

01:36.681 --> 01:39.100
I hit rock bottom when I
auditioned for the Spice Girls.

01:39.184 --> 01:40.852
I didn't even
get a callback.

01:40.935 --> 01:41.978
Which Spice Girl?

01:42.103 --> 01:43.146
The black one.

01:43.563 --> 01:45.023
I never stood a chance.

01:46.065 --> 01:47.108
Okay.

01:47.192 --> 01:49.110
Now think about my
journey here today

01:49.194 --> 01:51.738
and let it inspire
your journey.

01:52.363 --> 01:54.157
Okay. Nellie, thank you.
Thank you so much.

01:54.240 --> 01:55.283
Yep. Yep-

01:55.366 --> 02:00.663
Today is press day, and press is
going to make or break this store.

02:00.747 --> 02:04.375
And for a tech company, press can
only mean one thing, bloggers.

02:04.793 --> 02:06.294
Dossier on bloggers.

02:06.377 --> 02:11.549
Bloggers are gross. Bloggers are obese.
Bloggers have halitosis.

02:12.217 --> 02:13.551
You're going to love them.

02:14.135 --> 02:16.679
Ryan is going to be
the main event today.

02:16.930 --> 02:19.057
He is the pitchman
who is going to give

02:19.140 --> 02:21.309
the feisty yet
profound speech

02:21.392 --> 02:23.853
worthy of a world's fair.
Ryan, you ready to do this?

02:23.937 --> 02:25.146
When people see
this presentation,

02:25.230 --> 02:26.564
they're going to
in their pants.

02:26.606 --> 02:27.732
- Come on, man.
- Come on.

02:27.816 --> 02:29.734
Okay.
Seriously disgusting.

02:29.859 --> 02:31.903
Cathy, you will be the hot
girl who talks to bloggers.

02:32.070 --> 02:34.489
Ugh! Kill me.
It was my idea.

02:34.572 --> 02:37.283
Packer, you will be the sexual
predator who has come to prey

02:37.367 --> 02:40.411
on the trendy teenage girls who
are obsessed with the Pyramid.

02:40.703 --> 02:42.080
- Uh...
- Ah...

02:42.205 --> 02:43.331
That is excellent.

02:43.414 --> 02:44.582
I don't see what
that gets us,

02:44.666 --> 02:45.750
but I'm a team player.

02:45.834 --> 02:47.001
Perfect casting, right?

02:47.085 --> 02:50.171
Schrute's out to get me,
but I'm playing the long game.

02:50.255 --> 02:54.008
As soon as he messes up, I swoop
in like a sexual predator.

02:55.051 --> 02:59.430
I want to create a sense
of wonder and enthusiasm,

02:59.597 --> 03:03.852
as if at the end of E.T., candy
poured out of the screen.

03:04.227 --> 03:05.562
Do you understand?

03:06.104 --> 03:07.647
I want to get
goose pimples.

03:08.606 --> 03:12.819
Speaking of pimples let's
release the bloggers!

03:14.904 --> 03:15.947
Morning, everyone.

03:16.030 --> 03:17.699
Oh, Andy, guess what
happened to me this morning.

03:17.824 --> 03:19.576
Don't care. Tell me later.
Listen, it's important.

03:19.659 --> 03:20.910
You've got to hear this.

03:22.912 --> 03:23.997
What do you got?

03:24.122 --> 03:25.957
Oh, my God.
Do you have a black eye?

03:26.040 --> 03:27.250
Yes, I do, Phyllis.

03:27.333 --> 03:29.210
I woke up at 4:00 a.m.
by accident,

03:29.294 --> 03:31.087
in time for
the paper to be delivered.

03:31.170 --> 03:32.171
Guess what?

03:32.547 --> 03:35.884
It's not a kid on a bike.
It's a man in a car.

03:36.092 --> 03:37.510
Andy, who punched you?

03:37.719 --> 03:40.680
Hey, I was on the can. What's this
about a black guy in the office?

03:40.972 --> 03:42.557
Black eye, Meredith.

03:42.640 --> 03:44.309
Will someone please explain
what's going on here?

03:44.392 --> 03:48.062
Since the interesting thing happened
until now, so much time has passed.

03:48.146 --> 03:49.522
It's like my
life is buffering.

03:50.315 --> 03:53.902
Here's what happened. Pam and
I were arriving for the day

03:53.985 --> 03:58.573
and there was a gang in the parking
lot, on bikes, on motorcycles.

03:58.656 --> 04:00.909
And they just
were hassling Pam.

04:00.992 --> 04:02.160
That's true.

04:02.243 --> 04:03.620
They had weapons.

04:03.703 --> 04:04.746
Weapons.

04:05.163 --> 04:07.457
I just stepped in to talk
some sense into them.

04:07.540 --> 04:10.710
But these were not the kind of
people who use their words.

04:10.835 --> 04:13.463
Punches were going,
and I ducked a few,

04:13.546 --> 04:15.882
landed a couple, and I
was fighting them off.

04:15.965 --> 04:19.177
It was a totally,
like, senseless crime.

04:19.302 --> 04:21.137
- Thank goodness he was there.
- Good job, Andy.

04:23.431 --> 04:26.225
I didn't do anything any
of you wouldn't have done.

04:27.018 --> 04:28.478
Open the gates!

04:29.646 --> 04:32.482
There's plenty for everyone.
No need to panic.

04:32.565 --> 04:34.984
There's plenty for everyone.
There's plenty...

04:35.068 --> 04:37.570
Don't stampede.
No need to stampede, sir.

04:38.196 --> 04:42.867
Okay, okay! Hey, hey! It's going to be fine!
It's going to be fine!

04:42.992 --> 04:44.494
There's plenty of Pyramids!

04:44.577 --> 04:46.245
Come on,
I was in line before you.

04:46.829 --> 04:48.623
So you're
a blogger, right?

04:48.706 --> 04:49.874
Yeah.

04:50.041 --> 04:51.125
Blogger.

04:51.209 --> 04:53.044
God, stay away.

04:55.004 --> 04:56.631
Oh, I always get in
trouble around bloggers.

04:56.714 --> 04:58.383
I'm trying to be
a good girl for once.

04:59.342 --> 05:02.387
Uh, yeah, I already bought my Pyramid,
but I don't want to leave yet.

05:02.470 --> 05:05.807
I haven't had so much fun
since seeing Zooey Deschanel

05:05.890 --> 05:09.060
at the Coachella music festival.
So fun.

05:09.394 --> 05:11.604
How can we feel safe knowing
that there are gangs here?

05:11.729 --> 05:13.356
- We should call the police right now!
- Yes!

05:13.439 --> 05:16.401
No,no,no,no,no,no! We don't
need to call the police.

05:16.651 --> 05:18.403
They'll just ask
everybody questions,

05:18.486 --> 05:20.238
get up in everyone's
business, right, Pam?

05:20.321 --> 05:22.907
Police are a hassle. We
settled this on the street.

05:23.032 --> 05:26.285
And my eye will heal.
But if the police come,

05:26.369 --> 05:29.747
then we will forever stain our
neighborhood as a troubled area.

05:29.998 --> 05:33.167
Why would you care what the
police think of our neighborhood?

05:33.251 --> 05:37.422
Because I have neighborhood pride.
18505!

05:37.505 --> 05:38.756
18505!

05:38.840 --> 05:41.092
Guys, guys,
that's so vague.

05:41.259 --> 05:43.177
You got to do
the zip plus four.

05:43.428 --> 05:47.265
18505-7427.

05:47.724 --> 05:51.102
Look, I don't feel safe. I think
we should call the police.

05:51.227 --> 05:53.021
Yes. Exactly,
we need to feel safe,

05:53.104 --> 05:57.608
which is why Toby is
teaching us self-defense.

05:59.527 --> 06:00.528
Me?

06:00.611 --> 06:02.113
Toby, will you
teach us self-defense?

06:02.447 --> 06:05.033
Yeah. I can't believe
you remembered.

06:05.116 --> 06:08.453
I do self-defense.
I'll go put on my cup.

06:09.203 --> 06:10.246
Great.

06:10.663 --> 06:11.873
- Yes!
- Okay.

06:11.956 --> 06:14.000
I wasn't sure which
one of you was Chuck.

06:14.083 --> 06:16.127
Yeah, no, it seems
to be going great.

06:17.670 --> 06:19.464
Andy got beat up by
a fifth grade girl?

06:19.881 --> 06:21.799
Look at that guy, he's got
a Sabre phone on him,

06:21.883 --> 06:23.176
he's not even using it.

06:23.259 --> 06:25.887
This is a perfect photo
for my daily fail blog.

06:26.971 --> 06:28.890
Uh, I got to go.
Okay.

06:29.098 --> 06:31.267
Dwight, what is a fail?
That sounds bad.

06:31.350 --> 06:33.644
No, no, no, it's good.
It's really...

06:33.728 --> 06:36.647
On the Internet, that's a
really good, good thing.

06:37.482 --> 06:39.442
Are you trying to
sabotage this entire event?

06:39.525 --> 06:40.610
I'm very sorry.

06:40.693 --> 06:45.406
We gave you an Arrowhead
for free for the day.

06:45.698 --> 06:48.242
How hard would it have
been to do this? Hmm?

06:49.243 --> 06:53.831
Hello. Hi, sweetie, it's Jim. I'm
calling you from my new Arrowhead,

06:53.915 --> 06:55.541
which is why my
voice is crystal clear

06:55.625 --> 06:57.168
and my hand
won't ever get tired

06:57.251 --> 06:59.420
because of
the ergonomic shape.

06:59.504 --> 07:03.216
I'm really sorry. ls there anything I can do?
Maybe pretend to be Chuck?

07:03.341 --> 07:04.717
You could have
pretended to be Chuck.

07:04.801 --> 07:06.594
I begged you to
pretend to be Chuck.

07:06.677 --> 07:09.555
But you chose to be yourself and
you can no longer be Chuck.

07:09.806 --> 07:11.349
Surrender the tri-pack.

07:16.979 --> 07:18.189
You know what
you have to do.

07:24.695 --> 07:27.031
Point it towards
the store, idiot.

07:36.999 --> 07:38.417
You know what I mean?

07:38.501 --> 07:39.794
Pick one of these
buttons and just...

07:41.212 --> 07:43.172
Damn it. Take over.

07:44.048 --> 07:46.259
Oh, hey, hey, hey, you guys.
You must be lost.

07:46.342 --> 07:48.302
Listen.
Excuse me, sir.

07:48.386 --> 07:51.139
The fountain where you can feed the
pigeons is out behind the bank.

07:51.222 --> 07:53.307
Tell your great-grandson
to bring his kid by.

07:53.391 --> 07:55.476
Okay, so long.
Here we go.

07:55.726 --> 07:57.562
Erin! Psst! Come on.

07:57.812 --> 08:00.356
The elderly suck the life out of the young.
Get them out of here.

08:00.523 --> 08:03.109
We are closed.
Come on.

08:03.693 --> 08:06.654
Self-defense is not some
fun boxing match, okay?

08:06.737 --> 08:08.322
This is about
escaping with your life.

08:08.406 --> 08:12.160
So strike,
scream and run.

08:13.286 --> 08:14.412
All right,
let's try it.

08:20.543 --> 08:21.544
That may have
been my fault.

08:21.627 --> 08:22.712
What the hell, Toby?

08:22.795 --> 08:25.006
Okay, look, in a real
crisis situation,

08:25.089 --> 08:26.674
you're not going to
have time to think.

08:27.133 --> 08:29.927
Okay?
So just remember IAATG.

08:30.469 --> 08:32.054
"It's All About The Groin."

08:32.138 --> 08:37.310
What if you're being
attacked by a smallish man

08:37.393 --> 08:39.270
who happens to
not have a groin?

08:39.937 --> 08:41.355
I don't think
that's very common.

08:41.439 --> 08:43.024
But what if
you're being attacked

08:43.107 --> 08:45.902
by a 4'11" man
who's penis-less.

08:46.235 --> 08:49.322
Why are you fixated on this
hypothetical transgendered attacker?

08:49.488 --> 08:50.907
Why don't we
start with the basics?

08:50.990 --> 08:52.950
Show us how to defend
ourself against a baby

08:53.034 --> 08:55.786
and then like
a fifth-grade girl

08:55.870 --> 08:58.998
and then, you know, if we have
time, on up to a scary man.

08:59.123 --> 09:03.336
The most common scenario is a larger
man attacking a smaller female.

09:03.461 --> 09:08.132
So in that scenario,
what if the victim

09:08.216 --> 09:10.426
sucker punches
the attacker in the face?

09:10.718 --> 09:13.888
What can the attacker then do
to better protect himself?

09:14.138 --> 09:15.765
It's interesting
that you're drawn

09:15.848 --> 09:17.683
to the point of
view of the attacker.

09:17.975 --> 09:20.686
You would like
The Turn of the Table.

09:20.811 --> 09:22.563
Okay? The latest
Chad Flenderman novel.

09:23.731 --> 09:26.400
From the point of view of his
nemesis, Dr. Lucifer Woo.

09:26.484 --> 09:28.569
Can I please leave?
I have a rape flute.

09:28.736 --> 09:30.988
All right, well, let's try one
simple technique together.

09:31.072 --> 09:32.782
Okay, why doesn't
everyone stand?

09:32.865 --> 09:34.575
Okay, so,
you're being attacked,

09:34.659 --> 09:37.662
you've got your hands up,
simple palm strike to the chin.

09:37.954 --> 09:40.164
Up to the chin.
One, two.

09:40.498 --> 09:41.874
One, two.

09:42.375 --> 09:44.335
One, two.

09:44.961 --> 09:48.589
Cathy, I would like to introduce
you to Fatty Gruesome.

09:48.673 --> 09:51.175
He is a freelancer
for Wired magazine.

09:51.676 --> 09:53.261
Patty Grossman.
I'm a woman.

09:53.469 --> 09:54.804
But you still work
for Wired, right?

09:54.887 --> 09:56.013
Yes.
Good.

09:56.097 --> 09:57.640
Okay. Flirt away.

09:59.183 --> 10:01.852
Sabre. It's time
to come home.

10:05.523 --> 10:06.732
Yeah.

10:07.566 --> 10:10.528
Yeah. I mean, I think... It seemed
like you were a little nervous.

10:10.611 --> 10:11.862
Yeah, no  Sherlock.

10:11.946 --> 10:13.531
Can somebody please tell
me something encouraging

10:13.614 --> 10:14.699
about this presentation

10:14.782 --> 10:16.784
before I go out there in front
of a million people and do it?

10:16.867 --> 10:17.910
Okay. I know!
I know, champ.

10:17.994 --> 10:19.912
Just calm down
because, listen,

10:19.996 --> 10:21.706
when you are out in front
of all those people...

10:21.789 --> 10:22.790
Yeah, what?

10:22.873 --> 10:23.916
....you just
need to realize

10:24.000 --> 10:27.128
so much rides on this.

10:27.211 --> 10:28.838
You have no idea.

10:28.921 --> 10:29.964
Dwight.

10:30.047 --> 10:31.382
I'm trying to make
him feel important.

10:32.049 --> 10:35.011
I wish Kelly were here.
She always knew what to say.

10:35.803 --> 10:36.887
Um...

10:38.055 --> 10:40.641
Oh, Ryan, you're so smart.

10:40.725 --> 10:42.435
You're smarter
than Mark Zuckerberg

10:42.518 --> 10:44.562
and those Google guys
all combined.

10:46.022 --> 10:48.399
You're so ignorant. You barely
know what you're talking about.

10:48.607 --> 10:50.234
It's so ridiculous.

10:50.693 --> 10:52.653
You really need to
read a couple of books.

10:52.903 --> 10:54.238
What's a book?

10:54.572 --> 10:56.741
Oh, my God.
You're so embarrassing.

10:57.533 --> 10:59.869
My mom would say
the best stuff though.

11:07.001 --> 11:08.210
You can...

11:09.337 --> 11:10.463
You can do it, Ryan.

11:10.629 --> 11:12.965
And you know that
I'm capable of this?

11:13.049 --> 11:15.343
You're the only one
who can do it, sweetie.

11:15.426 --> 11:17.595
What did you think
of the presentation?

11:17.678 --> 11:19.347
I thought
it was great, sweetie.

11:20.389 --> 11:21.849
I would just
fix that one...

11:21.932 --> 11:23.684
"Fix" means you hate it!
I knew it!

11:23.768 --> 11:24.977
I need something
to drink!

11:25.061 --> 11:26.228
Jim, get him a water.

11:26.312 --> 11:27.605
No, not a water,
a sports drink!

11:27.688 --> 11:28.939
I hate everything
in that fridge.

11:29.023 --> 11:31.359
Not red! Get me something
yellow or green

11:31.442 --> 11:33.235
from a nearby store.
Not red!

11:34.362 --> 11:35.529
Why are you just
standing there?

11:35.613 --> 11:38.115
Go to a nearby store and get him
a yellow or green sports drink.

11:40.826 --> 11:43.746
Now if your attacker is
willing to defile a corpse,

11:43.829 --> 11:46.123
you better stop
playing dead right away

11:46.248 --> 11:47.917
and just make it known that you're alive.

11:48.042 --> 11:49.668
Forgive me
for interrupting.

11:50.044 --> 11:53.047
I believe my daughter had an
altercation with somebody here,

11:53.130 --> 11:55.674
some fancy gentleman
with a squeaky voice?

11:55.758 --> 11:57.802
I think you guys
might have the wrong office.

11:57.885 --> 11:59.720
That's him.
The guy I hit.

11:59.804 --> 12:00.846
What?

12:00.930 --> 12:02.556
You've got
to be kidding me.

12:02.640 --> 12:03.974
Poor Andy.

12:04.934 --> 12:08.229
First you got beat up by a gang
and now she kicks your ass.

12:08.312 --> 12:09.271
No, Kevin.

12:09.355 --> 12:11.357
What about the lady
you hit with a pinecone?

12:11.440 --> 12:12.983
There.
That chubby one.

12:14.068 --> 12:15.277
I just had a baby.

12:15.361 --> 12:16.570
Yesterday?

12:16.821 --> 12:18.572
Wow.
Apologize.

12:19.156 --> 12:22.326
Sorry I kicked your ass in front
of your "thin" girlfriend.

12:22.451 --> 12:24.662
How about we wait until next
year after you have your kid?

12:24.954 --> 12:26.956
You know what? Tiffany's
going to college.

12:27.039 --> 12:29.458
Listen, I don't know what
you guys are talking about,

12:29.542 --> 12:33.170
but I guess I'll just accept your
apology so we can get on with our day.

12:33.421 --> 12:36.507
God bless. A friend of
mine uses your paper.

12:36.590 --> 12:37.758
You do good work.

12:38.968 --> 12:40.219
BYE-bye.
Bye.

12:40.803 --> 12:43.931
So, Toby, I think we should do a
different self-defense seminar,

12:44.014 --> 12:46.475
how to protect ourselves
against tiny little girls.

12:46.642 --> 12:49.728
There's no shame in getting
beaten up by a girl.

12:49.812 --> 12:51.856
My ex-wife used
to demolish me.

12:52.148 --> 12:53.482
No, there is
shame in it, okay?

12:53.566 --> 12:55.276
We have to draw the
line somewhere.

12:55.359 --> 12:57.695
Oh, my God, I think I see
the imprint of a Ring Pop.

12:57.945 --> 12:59.113
Oh...

13:01.115 --> 13:02.366
Have you seen Erin?

13:02.450 --> 13:03.659
I'm on break.

13:06.871 --> 13:07.872
Oh, my God.

13:08.164 --> 13:09.832
No, hey, bloggers, where
do you think you're going?

13:09.915 --> 13:11.292
No, you got to stay
for the big presentation.

13:11.375 --> 13:12.710
We got this
young whiz kid, Ryan.

13:12.793 --> 13:14.462
He's like an even
more handsome Bill Gates.

13:14.545 --> 13:15.671
When's the presentation?

13:15.796 --> 13:17.423
It's moments away!
Just stay here.

13:17.631 --> 13:19.967
Hey, Uncle Lucas,
it's your nephew, Ryan.

13:20.050 --> 13:23.137
Honestly, I could use a
prescription for Ritalin right now.

13:24.096 --> 13:26.348
Well, I know you did
one for Aunt Carol.

13:27.641 --> 13:29.768
So it's different
because it's your wife?

13:29.852 --> 13:31.979
Well, that doesn't
make any sense to me.

13:32.062 --> 13:33.772
How are you doing?
Don't talk to me right now.

13:33.856 --> 13:35.316
I'm sorry.
I know you're my boss,

13:35.399 --> 13:36.609
but seriously,
you need to get

13:36.692 --> 13:38.068
the hell out of my face.

13:40.905 --> 13:44.950
Your little man is unraveling.
Now go and fix it.

13:45.409 --> 13:46.994
Sorry about
kicking you out.

13:47.077 --> 13:50.331
It's just we don't want our
brand associated with death.

13:50.414 --> 13:54.585
It's okay. I'll go to the Costco
and search for handsome men.

13:55.085 --> 13:56.504
You're not married yet?

13:56.754 --> 14:00.508
Oh, I was. My husband
was my best friend.

14:01.050 --> 14:02.301
He passed away.

14:04.094 --> 14:06.430
My best friend
was my boss, Andy.

14:07.056 --> 14:08.933
We dated for a while,
but since then,

14:09.016 --> 14:11.018
he rejected me and
we're not really friends.

14:11.644 --> 14:16.315
Someone rejected you? With
that body and those bazongas?

14:16.690 --> 14:17.858
Forget him.

14:18.567 --> 14:22.571
Yeah. Forget him! And you
should forget your husband.

14:23.155 --> 14:24.156
Well...

14:25.991 --> 14:27.201
How long has he
been in the bathroom?

14:27.284 --> 14:28.410
Like 10 minutes.

14:28.494 --> 14:30.204
Geez, what's he
doing in there?

14:30.287 --> 14:31.539
Oh, that's my phone.

14:31.622 --> 14:32.873
Am I allowed to answer it or
are you going to freak out?

14:32.957 --> 14:33.958
Are there bloggers around?

14:34.625 --> 14:35.626
It's Ryan.

14:35.960 --> 14:38.254
"I'm sorry. I lied.
I'm not in the bathroom.

14:38.337 --> 14:40.589
"I can't do it.
I need to see my mom.

14:40.673 --> 14:41.799
"I'm going home."

14:41.882 --> 14:43.968
What is the delay here?

14:45.302 --> 14:46.387
Where is Ryan?

14:47.137 --> 14:48.556
Why is he not here?

14:48.681 --> 14:50.140
I had to send him home.

14:51.225 --> 14:54.144
As brilliant and
creative as he is,

14:54.270 --> 14:57.189
he is nothing
compared to this guy!

14:57.523 --> 14:58.524
Uh...

14:59.066 --> 15:00.067
What?

15:00.150 --> 15:01.402
That's right. Will you
just give us a second?

15:01.485 --> 15:03.445
You are going to bloody ruin it.
You're going to bloody ruin it

15:03.529 --> 15:05.990
because you're a no-good,
half-assed, cockeyed numpty!

15:06.073 --> 15:07.366
Okay. Okay.

15:08.492 --> 15:09.827
Jim. I'm not doing
the presentation.

15:10.202 --> 15:13.706
Look at me. Look at me.
Look at this face.

15:13.872 --> 15:15.541
This is not
the face of a performer.

15:15.624 --> 15:18.836
This is the face of a scary
apparition you see before you die.

15:19.670 --> 15:24.967
I'm telling you, if you don't do
this, I don't stand a chance.

15:26.510 --> 15:27.595
Please, Jim.

15:33.434 --> 15:34.685
Okay, I'll do it.

15:35.769 --> 15:39.857
Uh, my God. Okay!

15:39.982 --> 15:41.734
Go get into Ryan's costume
and check out his notes.

15:41.817 --> 15:42.860
A costume?

15:42.943 --> 15:44.528
Of course
there's a costume.

15:46.113 --> 15:47.489
Oh, this is going
to be great.

15:47.573 --> 15:48.866
There's nothing like
some last minute changes

15:48.949 --> 15:51.660
to really energize
a presentation. Huh?

16:03.964 --> 16:06.133
Did you pass out in there?
What is taking so long?

16:06.216 --> 16:07.926
I've been in here
for 20 seconds.

16:08.010 --> 16:10.888
Hurry up! Let me in! I want
to watch you get dressed.

16:11.138 --> 16:13.182
Did you find
the eyeliner?

16:14.058 --> 16:15.142
I'm not wearing eyeliner.

16:15.225 --> 16:17.353
You are wearing
eyeliner, Jim.

16:26.570 --> 16:30.783
Time, space, gender.

16:30.991 --> 16:32.409
There are
no rules anymore.

16:33.035 --> 16:34.912
All boundaries
are breaking down

16:35.412 --> 16:38.040
in the wake of
the infinite future.

16:39.500 --> 16:42.670
The only thing that... The
only thing that remains...

16:42.878 --> 16:44.171
The only thing
that remains

16:44.254 --> 16:46.674
are the things that have
stood the test of time.

16:46.757 --> 16:51.261
Love, values, and of
course, the Pyramids.

16:51.929 --> 16:54.765
The strongest shape
ever constructed.

16:55.015 --> 16:59.186
A shape that fits all other
shapes inside of it.

16:59.269 --> 17:00.354
No, that's...

17:00.437 --> 17:01.480
Mmm. It's true.

17:01.772 --> 17:07.403
This is the future
because this is the past.

17:08.445 --> 17:10.572
I've been through a lot
of issues in my life.

17:11.198 --> 17:15.202
I've seen drug addiction,
unemployment.

17:15.828 --> 17:18.664
I've been in a relationship
that tore my heart apart

17:18.747 --> 17:22.626
without ever being able to
accept that love drove the pain.

17:23.127 --> 17:24.628
Yep.

17:24.712 --> 17:28.632
When I was 10 years old, my
parents took me to Disneyworld.

17:28.799 --> 17:30.676
I cried the whole time.

17:32.052 --> 17:36.306
I was not able to comprehend
the beauty that was before me.

17:37.307 --> 17:39.727
I just wanted to go home.

17:40.310 --> 17:43.564
This is what the Pyramid
will do for you.

17:43.939 --> 17:46.984
It is the bridge
to the world.

17:47.151 --> 17:48.986
It has the USB port.

17:49.194 --> 17:53.282
Wireless will be
available in 2013.

17:54.408 --> 17:59.663
You can play anything
from Chuck to Cars 2.

18:01.707 --> 18:06.837
With the Pyramid, you have the
connection to everything.

18:07.755 --> 18:10.466
In time and space.

18:14.970 --> 18:15.971
Psst!

18:17.097 --> 18:18.182
Oh.

18:22.519 --> 18:26.231
Sabre. It's time
to come home.

18:38.702 --> 18:41.246
All right.
Thank you so much. Wow!

18:42.039 --> 18:43.123
Wow!

18:44.458 --> 18:45.584
And good night!

18:47.044 --> 18:48.045
Yeah!

18:53.550 --> 18:55.302
Okay, this isn't over.
Let's stay focused, okay?

18:55.385 --> 18:58.555
We made fun of Andy earlier for
getting beat up by a little girl,

18:59.181 --> 19:01.225
but little things
can be dangerous.

19:01.308 --> 19:04.394
Whether it's a gremlin
or Chucky the doll,

19:04.561 --> 19:07.648
the key is to
throw it in something,

19:07.731 --> 19:11.068
like a fireplace or
a tub of electricity.

19:11.485 --> 19:13.278
Okay, good point. Um...

19:13.570 --> 19:16.698
Good point? What is a
tub of electricity?

19:17.449 --> 19:18.909
I don't know.
With all due respect,

19:18.992 --> 19:20.661
we know what we're
defending against.

19:20.744 --> 19:22.412
It's a 12-year-old
female bully.

19:22.579 --> 19:23.831
I was a 12-year-old bully.

19:24.456 --> 19:27.334
Great! I think Kelly
should attack Toby.

19:27.417 --> 19:28.502
MEREDITH; Yeah.

19:28.585 --> 19:29.795
Yeah, that's not
a bad idea actually

19:29.878 --> 19:31.922
because I have had
a lot of pent-up aggression.

19:32.005 --> 19:33.549
- Thanks.
- Good! Go!

19:33.674 --> 19:34.883
I don't know whether
this is gonna help.

19:35.008 --> 19:36.260
All right, Kelly!

19:36.677 --> 19:39.012
We should stay to maybe some
more traditional models.

19:39.096 --> 19:40.430
You think
you're so pretty?

19:40.514 --> 19:42.599
You're not going to be so
pretty come prom-time!

19:42.724 --> 19:44.142
Okay, this is what's called...
Take that!

19:44.226 --> 19:45.602
...pre-violent posture.
Take that!

19:46.061 --> 19:47.896
Not so pre-violent
anymore!

19:47.980 --> 19:50.649
I'm in what's called
the decision point.

19:50.816 --> 19:51.984
Hey, hey, hey.
Kelly! Kelly!

19:52.609 --> 19:53.777
Ow!

19:53.944 --> 19:55.112
My good eye!

19:56.113 --> 19:57.114
Oh, boy.

19:58.198 --> 19:59.575
Oh, no, I'm not
laughing at you.

19:59.658 --> 20:02.953
I'm laughing at
something that Cece did

20:03.036 --> 20:06.665
on the playground earlier,
yesterday, this morning.

20:07.541 --> 20:09.543
You know why I
got hit by girls?

20:10.460 --> 20:12.921
Because I stood up
for others.

20:13.005 --> 20:14.798
Pam and Toby.

20:16.133 --> 20:20.220
I stepped in and I didn't care
that I was standing up to girls.

20:20.304 --> 20:25.767
You may want to ask yourselves,
where were you when the girls came?

20:27.603 --> 20:30.230
Tough day, yes.
But I feel good.

20:30.314 --> 20:32.900
I put the office
in their place,

20:32.983 --> 20:36.403
took a bunch of painkillers, drank half
a bottle of wine, took my pants off.

20:36.486 --> 20:38.572
I just feel good.

20:40.866 --> 20:43.243
Okay, okay, I will be
the first to admit it.

20:43.327 --> 20:45.579
We could have integrated more
Chuck into the presentation.

20:45.662 --> 20:48.498
Dwight, you're
the vice president.

20:50.083 --> 20:54.671
Yeah!
Okay! Come on!

20:55.172 --> 20:56.214
Right On!

20:56.548 --> 20:58.175
Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam!

20:58.258 --> 20:59.259
Boom!
