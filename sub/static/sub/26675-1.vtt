01:36.875 --> 01:39.324
The scariest memories
is being taken away.

01:39.375 --> 01:42.447
I was taken when I
was six years old.

01:42.500 --> 01:45.208
I didn't understand why...

01:45.250 --> 01:47.351
When we spoke our language,
we were punished.

01:47.375 --> 01:49.082
Would hit me with a broom.

01:49.125 --> 01:50.309
Always punished for...

01:50.333 --> 01:51.540
for speaking our language.

01:51.583 --> 01:52.851
Drove out of here crying.

01:52.875 --> 01:55.947
A lot of crying families.

01:56.000 --> 01:57.366
Because I was so scared.

01:57.417 --> 01:59.351
These people talk all the time,

01:59.375 --> 02:01.412
and expected me to do the same.

02:03.542 --> 02:08.037
Told me many hearts beating
together makes us stronger.

02:09.375 --> 02:13.745
They said I should tell my story,

02:13.792 --> 02:17.081
that you can't understand
where you're going

02:17.125 --> 02:19.412
if you don't understand
where you've been.

02:43.583 --> 02:44.583
The coughing sick.

02:45.583 --> 02:48.542
He got it from school.

02:57.583 --> 03:04.535
We're going where the white
man can't find the boys.

03:14.917 --> 03:17.500
My brother ran away
from the school.

03:17.542 --> 03:21.331
The white officers wouldn't
stop looking for him.

03:25.542 --> 03:28.330
My parents had been taken
to school as children,

03:28.375 --> 03:31.209
and they were never the same.

03:31.250 --> 03:33.583
My grandmother insisted

03:33.625 --> 03:38.040
we head north, to our
family's ancestral land.

03:42.583 --> 03:43.583
It's a beautiful place.

03:44.583 --> 03:49.533
I told you I would take
you to a safe place.

04:14.583 --> 04:17.576
We are all spirit. We
are part of this lake.

04:17.625 --> 04:19.582
The white missionaries
named this place

04:20.416 --> 04:22.374
God's Lake.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.000
That's what they call it.

04:25.292 --> 04:27.079
And we call it

04:30.000 --> 04:31.787
Manitou Gameeng.

04:32.583 --> 04:34.540
But now, no one is here.

04:36.417 --> 04:37.491
Why?

04:37.492 --> 04:38.492
She's telling stories.

04:38.583 --> 04:39.583
Non.

04:40.583 --> 04:41.949
It's true.

04:43.417 --> 04:45.784
What would happen to them?

04:46.583 --> 04:48.540
A powerful presence

04:49.583 --> 04:51.540
drove them away.

04:52.583 --> 04:56.532
But our people said
prayers in the Old Talk

04:57.583 --> 04:59.540
Carried Spirit Plates
into the trees

05:00.583 --> 05:03.041
and your great-grandfather laid

05:03.083 --> 05:05.575
a tobacco offering
high up on that cliff.

05:18.583 --> 05:20.666
The spirits of the lake
are pleased we are here.

05:20.708 --> 05:21.949
That's blasphemy.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.208
We've got to give thanks to Jesus.

05:27.583 --> 05:31.532
Your Jesus never
fished these waters.

05:40.458 --> 05:43.041
I'm never going to the school.

05:43.083 --> 05:44.665
Then make sure they
never catch you.

05:44.708 --> 05:46.916
They won't.

05:46.958 --> 05:48.449
I run too fast.

05:48.500 --> 05:52.073
And... I'll hit them with stones.

05:53.333 --> 05:54.333
Wait.

05:57.167 --> 05:59.500
That one's special.

06:01.042 --> 06:04.114
You should keep it.

06:13.000 --> 06:16.619
My people are the Anishinabeg,

06:16.667 --> 06:20.991
the Fish Clan of the
Northern Ojibway.

06:22.292 --> 06:24.158
We sprang forth intact

06:24.208 --> 06:26.541
from the womb of our
mother, the Earth...

06:28.417 --> 06:31.990
Our cheekbones cut from
the granite ridges

06:32.042 --> 06:34.455
that rise above our homeland.

06:36.458 --> 06:39.656
Her heartbeat thrums in our ears.

06:42.042 --> 06:47.037
We were her stewards
and protectors...

06:47.083 --> 06:49.120
but we were forced

06:49.167 --> 06:52.660
beyond the influence
of our legends.

07:55.583 --> 07:57.540
We will honour him.

07:57.583 --> 07:59.540
We will care for him.

07:59.583 --> 08:00.809
We will take him to the high place

08:00.833 --> 08:03.291
like the ancestors
did long time ago.

08:03.333 --> 08:07.657
He's our son. Not yours.

08:07.673 --> 08:09.744
We're taking him to the priests
so he can get to heaven.

08:10.583 --> 08:16.163
You'll be taken be the white
man's drink and never come back.

08:17.000 --> 08:18.787
You'll never come back.

08:21.083 --> 08:23.541
Come with us?

08:23.583 --> 08:25.540
I won't come.

08:28.458 --> 08:30.666
Look after Saul.

08:30.708 --> 08:33.325
We'll be back soon.

09:05.792 --> 09:07.328
Mama.

09:10.625 --> 09:12.366
Papa.

09:50.042 --> 09:53.661
I watched and waited...

09:53.708 --> 09:55.165
through fall,

09:55.208 --> 09:57.825
till the sky turned to the
pale, washed-out blue

09:57.875 --> 09:59.286
of early winter.

10:18.583 --> 10:20.540
Where did my parents go?

10:25.583 --> 10:27.540
They are not coming back.

10:29.583 --> 10:30.583
We must leave.

10:31.417 --> 10:35.161
Go down to Minaki, that's
where my relatives live.

10:35.583 --> 10:40.533
It's a three day journey,
we'll stay there for winter.

10:42.583 --> 10:45.371
If we stay here, we will die.

10:50.583 --> 10:51.583
We must leave.

11:14.542 --> 11:18.286
I never saw my parents again...

11:18.333 --> 11:21.167
and I still don't know
what happened to them.

11:48.667 --> 11:50.533
"Keewatin"...

11:50.583 --> 11:54.076
that's the name of the North Wind.

11:54.125 --> 11:57.163
The old ones gave it a name

11:57.208 --> 12:03.041
because they believed it was
alive, a being, like all things.

12:05.750 --> 12:09.118
It descended upon us
like a slap of a hand...

12:09.167 --> 12:11.454
sudden and vindictive.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.083
Nookmis.

14:01.208 --> 14:05.157
There is a road up ahead.

14:08.000 --> 14:09.000
What about you?

14:09.417 --> 14:12.910
With all my being,
I will stay warm.

14:12.958 --> 14:14.915
We've got to keep moving.

14:27.083 --> 14:29.871
Chew on this, it will help.

14:45.583 --> 14:47.540
Almost there.

14:50.583 --> 14:51.583
Almost there.

15:10.583 --> 15:15.533
We made it, there's the road.

15:17.417 --> 15:19.204
Don't stop.

15:36.958 --> 15:38.790
Nookmis.

15:38.833 --> 15:40.916
Nookmis.

15:40.958 --> 15:43.541
Nookmis.

15:57.708 --> 15:59.574
Nookmis...

16:04.250 --> 16:06.833
Nookmis.

16:19.708 --> 16:21.995
Nookmis.

16:22.042 --> 16:23.374
You have to leave her, son.

16:25.458 --> 16:26.619
Nookmis.

16:26.667 --> 16:28.632
She's gone.

16:28.633 --> 16:29.633
Calm down, son.

16:29.708 --> 16:30.994
Nookmis.

16:38.292 --> 16:41.991
Nookmis.

16:42.917 --> 16:45.034
Nookmis.

16:46.833 --> 16:47.994
Nookmis.

17:17.750 --> 17:19.161
I read once

17:19.208 --> 17:22.656
there are holes in the universe
that swallow all light,

17:22.708 --> 17:24.199
all bodies.

17:25.416 --> 17:28.285
In what seemed like an instant,

17:28.333 --> 17:33.000
the world I had known was replaced
by an ominous black cloud.

17:33.042 --> 17:34.053
That's mine.

17:34.054 --> 17:36.208
That's mine. That's mine.

17:44.667 --> 17:45.667
Sit still. Sit still.

17:45.708 --> 17:47.495
Sit still.

17:47.542 --> 17:48.542
Stop it.

17:53.708 --> 17:55.244
Stand up.

17:59.042 --> 18:00.283
Stand. Now.

19:20.708 --> 19:22.199
What's your name?

19:24.708 --> 19:26.165
Saul.

19:26.208 --> 19:29.167
You speak English. Very good.

19:29.208 --> 19:32.076
My father taught me.

19:32.125 --> 19:35.789
And he gave you a
fine Biblical name.

19:35.833 --> 19:37.040
What is your name?

19:39.167 --> 19:41.033
I want to go home.

19:41.082 --> 19:42.082
In English, please.

19:42.083 --> 19:44.666
Let's try again. What's your name?

19:47.542 --> 19:49.408
Do you know it?

19:49.458 --> 19:50.824
Lonnie.

19:53.208 --> 19:57.122
You'll need something
more suitable than that.

19:59.000 --> 20:01.834
All right, from now on,
your name is Aaron.

20:01.875 --> 20:03.411
Tell him.

20:03.458 --> 20:05.871
He says your new name is Aaron.

20:07.792 --> 20:12.366
I have a name. My
father's. Lonnie.

20:12.708 --> 20:14.449
He says his...

20:14.500 --> 20:16.992
He says "Lonnie"
is his dad's name.

20:17.042 --> 20:20.331
The Lord God is your father now.

20:20.375 --> 20:22.708
Your human father has
nothing more to offer you.

20:22.750 --> 20:24.707
He's a trapper.

20:26.208 --> 20:27.540
He says he's a trapper.

20:27.583 --> 20:28.915
He's a heathen.

20:28.958 --> 20:30.620
He's Ojibway.

20:31.542 --> 20:34.116
Aaron, our goal here is to help
you succeed in this world,

20:34.167 --> 20:35.533
so you have to learn English.

20:41.792 --> 20:43.533
Sorry, son.

21:02.458 --> 21:04.324
That's a good boy.

21:27.708 --> 21:29.244
Sorry, Father.

21:33.167 --> 21:35.375
You're disgusting.

21:35.417 --> 21:36.874
Look at this.

21:36.917 --> 21:38.182
Look at the filthy mess you made.

21:38.183 --> 21:39.665
Enough.

21:39.708 --> 21:41.825
That's no help to him.

21:41.875 --> 21:43.992
Who are you to say?

21:44.042 --> 21:46.159
Leave this to me.

21:51.000 --> 21:54.500
Gather your sheets and
take them to the laundry.

21:57.000 --> 21:59.083
Give us this day our daily bread,

21:59.125 --> 22:01.458
and forgive us our trespasses

22:01.500 --> 22:03.742
as we forgive those who
trespass against us,

22:03.792 --> 22:06.751
and lead us not into temptation,

22:06.792 --> 22:08.954
but deliver us from evil. Amen.

22:09.000 --> 22:11.743
In the name of the
Father, and of the Son,

22:11.792 --> 22:14.079
and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.

22:18.583 --> 22:20.916
Just like home.

22:26.042 --> 22:28.250
At least you don't
have to chew it.

22:34.208 --> 22:35.494
Good morning, Father.

22:39.083 --> 22:40.995
I don't like it.

22:41.042 --> 22:42.328
No.

22:42.375 --> 22:44.492
You have to go back.
You have to go back.

22:44.542 --> 22:46.204
No, Katherine.

22:46.250 --> 22:48.037
Here she comes. Let go.

22:49.833 --> 22:51.199
Hey. No. No.

22:51.250 --> 22:53.333
No, no. I don't want
to go back down there.

22:53.375 --> 22:54.911
That's enough. Sit down.

22:54.958 --> 22:57.540
Turn around. Eat your food,
or you'll be sent downstairs.

22:58.875 --> 23:00.366
You know where she goes.

23:00.417 --> 23:01.417
Yes, Sister.

23:01.458 --> 23:02.744
Louder.

23:02.792 --> 23:05.000
Yes, Sister.

23:19.042 --> 23:21.284
Behold the Lamb of God...

23:21.333 --> 23:23.825
behold He who takest away
the sins of the world.

23:23.875 --> 23:28.040
Blessed are they who are called
to the supper of the Lamb.

23:28.083 --> 23:31.036
They called it a school,
but it was never that.

23:31.083 --> 23:33.291
The Body of Christ.

23:33.333 --> 23:36.497
There were no grades
or examinations.

23:36.542 --> 23:42.205
The only test was our
ability to endure.

23:45.250 --> 23:47.907
I expect you to learn
this for tomorrow.

23:47.908 --> 23:48.908
Psst.

23:49.041 --> 23:50.041
All of it.

23:50.042 --> 23:51.328
Anish. Anish.

23:59.000 --> 24:00.491
Stand up.

24:02.208 --> 24:04.165
This is the third time this week

24:04.208 --> 24:07.280
I've heard you speaking Ojibway.

24:07.333 --> 24:09.165
Come here.

24:14.958 --> 24:16.995
The Good God gave you this mouth.

24:17.042 --> 24:19.659
He gave you language.

24:19.708 --> 24:21.165
It is a very grave sin

24:21.208 --> 24:24.451
to corrupt these sacred gifts
with falsehood and deceit.

24:25.833 --> 24:26.914
Open.

24:26.958 --> 24:29.416
Open.

24:34.500 --> 24:36.366
Go see Father Gaston
in the office.

24:41.250 --> 24:45.999
Forgive me, Sister, but the
boy is already suffering.

24:46.042 --> 24:48.991
Soon enough you'll realise the
importance of consistency

24:49.042 --> 24:50.829
in building discipline and trust.

24:50.875 --> 24:52.992
I was taught that if
you win their hearts,

24:53.042 --> 24:54.874
you win their minds.

24:54.917 --> 24:56.499
And what other theoretical drivel

24:56.542 --> 24:59.740
do they teach you at the
seminary, Father Gaston?

24:59.792 --> 25:03.709
The bough that doesn't
bend will break, Sister.

25:03.750 --> 25:07.164
We'll see what Father Quinney
has to say about that.

25:13.208 --> 25:15.916
I have a secret place
for us to go tomorrow.

25:15.958 --> 25:17.995
Meet us outside.

25:21.417 --> 25:22.417
Let's go.

25:25.292 --> 25:28.706
My grandmother had always
referred to the universe

25:28.750 --> 25:32.824
as "the Great Mystery."

25:32.875 --> 25:37.290
Mystery fills us
with awe and wonder.

25:37.333 --> 25:40.326
It is the foundation of humility,

25:40.375 --> 25:46.326
and humility is the
foundation of all learning.

25:46.375 --> 25:49.573
So we do not seek to unravel this.

25:49.625 --> 25:53.164
We honour it by letting
it be that way forever.

25:53.208 --> 25:54.494
Hey.

25:54.542 --> 25:56.204
Waabooz.

26:04.500 --> 26:06.742
His leniency is in
clear contravention

26:06.792 --> 26:08.454
of our ideals and practises.

26:08.500 --> 26:11.415
There's a difference between
leniency and human kindness.

26:11.458 --> 26:14.665
It isn't kind to deprive
children of guidance.

26:14.708 --> 26:15.915
You're quite right, Sister.

26:15.958 --> 26:17.574
That is our mission, after all,

26:17.625 --> 26:20.493
but there are a lot of
ways to achieve this goal.

26:20.542 --> 26:24.041
Sister, this winter
you'll see some changes.

26:24.083 --> 26:28.163
I'm going to provide the children
with a new outdoor activity.

26:28.208 --> 26:30.495
What's he talking about?

26:30.542 --> 26:32.625
A little higher, please.

26:44.333 --> 26:46.996
What're you making?

26:47.042 --> 26:48.499
An ice rink.

26:48.542 --> 26:50.750
For skating...

26:50.792 --> 26:52.784
and hockey.

26:52.833 --> 26:54.825
What's that?

26:56.707 --> 26:57.707
You'll see...

26:57.708 --> 26:59.324
soon enough.

27:05.917 --> 27:08.204
Look what they're making.

27:09.208 --> 27:11.291
Let me see.

27:19.625 --> 27:21.366
Rebecca...

27:21.417 --> 27:23.374
Rebecca.

27:26.542 --> 27:28.499
You got to let go.

27:28.542 --> 27:29.828
No.

27:29.875 --> 27:30.911
Come on, Katherine.

27:30.958 --> 27:32.324
Don't, they'll lock you up again.

27:32.375 --> 27:34.615
Hurry. They're coming. Please
don't. You got to let go.

27:36.125 --> 27:38.242
She's back with you again.

27:38.292 --> 27:42.161
Rebecca, you know
why we forbid this.

27:42.208 --> 27:44.495
Because it makes her weak?

27:44.542 --> 27:46.534
And?

27:46.583 --> 27:50.079
She clings to me instead of
the Good God, our Father.

27:52.042 --> 27:53.829
Put the little one in Contrition.

27:53.875 --> 27:55.161
No. No, please.

27:55.208 --> 27:58.076
You promised to
control her, Rebecca.

27:58.125 --> 27:59.885
Sister. Please let her
go. Please let her go.

28:01.292 --> 28:02.292
Rebecca.

28:23.875 --> 28:28.001
Our Lord, who was crucified,
died, and was buried.

28:28.042 --> 28:30.329
The third day, he rose again...

28:31.875 --> 28:35.494
Your mistake?

28:35.542 --> 28:37.625
Jesus only arose once.

28:38.792 --> 28:42.331
You suffer from the sin
of pride, Rebecca.

28:42.375 --> 28:44.458
Go to the corner and
quietly continue.

28:49.792 --> 28:54.490
Our Father, who art in heaven...

28:59.457 --> 29:00.457
Saul.

29:00.458 --> 29:03.326
Stand and say the Lord's Prayer.

29:10.042 --> 29:12.125
Our Father...

29:13.875 --> 29:16.367
Our Father...

29:17.833 --> 29:19.665
How...

29:19.708 --> 29:22.325
Who...

29:24.833 --> 29:26.950
Who art in Heaven,

29:27.000 --> 29:28.036
hallowed...

29:28.083 --> 29:31.372
be thy name...

32:15.208 --> 32:16.995
Okay, but let's keep
it simple, okay?

32:17.042 --> 32:18.874
Let's start half speed.

32:18.917 --> 32:19.917
Here we go.

32:24.083 --> 32:26.666
Quick, quick, quick.

32:29.542 --> 32:33.291
You look like you've never seen
people skate before, Saul.

32:34.625 --> 32:37.038
I don't like games much.

32:37.083 --> 32:39.325
Just watch.

32:39.375 --> 32:42.209
There's a genuine rhythm
underneath all this mayhem.

32:42.250 --> 32:45.163
Once you grasp the rules,
you'll start to see it.

32:57.000 --> 32:59.242
I see it already.

32:59.292 --> 33:00.292
You do?

33:03.125 --> 33:07.165
It's cleared back
into Canada's zone.

33:07.208 --> 33:09.200
Here they are, four of
them out over the line.

33:09.250 --> 33:11.116
Peyton, he cleared
it in the left side.

33:11.167 --> 33:13.079
MacGuiness has it, 27 seconds,

33:13.125 --> 33:14.292
there it is, a break,
and he scores.

33:14.293 --> 33:16.825
Yes.

33:16.875 --> 33:19.162
I want to learn to skate.

33:20.917 --> 33:22.203
Sorry, Saul, you can't.

33:22.250 --> 33:26.073
Father Quinney only allows
the older boys to play.

33:26.125 --> 33:27.991
19 minutes, 33 seconds.

33:28.042 --> 33:29.499
You don't have to tell him.

33:33.958 --> 33:35.324
Rules are rules.

33:35.375 --> 33:40.414
If I break them for you, it
could ruin it for everybody.

33:45.625 --> 33:46.957
Peyton comes away with it.

33:47.000 --> 33:48.036
Up to Burns...

33:48.083 --> 33:50.416
I can be the one to
look after the ice.

33:50.458 --> 33:52.825
I'll do it before
anybody wakes up.

33:52.875 --> 33:55.117
Nobody will know.

33:55.167 --> 33:57.159
He fakes the shot and
sends it to MacGuiness,

33:57.208 --> 33:58.643
but the shot goes
wide into the corner.

33:58.667 --> 34:01.749
Will you keep up your
studies and chores?

34:03.708 --> 34:05.995
All right, then.

34:07.083 --> 34:08.494
Canada wins it, three to nothing.

34:08.542 --> 34:09.873
All right, boys.

34:09.917 --> 34:12.079
That's it, back to the dorm.

34:54.208 --> 34:58.828
The rink became my escape...

34:58.875 --> 35:01.117
the ice, my obsession...

35:01.167 --> 35:03.500
the game...

35:03.542 --> 35:05.329
my survival.

36:27.875 --> 36:32.034
Blessed are those who are called
to the supper of the Lamb.

37:48.958 --> 37:51.166
Yes.

37:57.625 --> 38:00.658
Was that Saul I saw out on the
ice this morning, first thing?

38:00.708 --> 38:03.166
Yes, Father. He's helping me.

38:03.208 --> 38:06.082
He's doing the morning
maintenance on the ice rink.

38:06.125 --> 38:09.163
And he's in charge of
the equipment locker.

38:09.208 --> 38:11.040
As long as he isn't playing.

38:11.083 --> 38:14.531
He's too young.

38:14.583 --> 38:15.583
Thank you, Father.

38:23.875 --> 38:25.491
Okay, let's try it. Here we go.

38:29.208 --> 38:30.415
Ah.

38:30.458 --> 38:31.790
Tommy?

38:31.833 --> 38:33.995
I'm all right.

38:34.042 --> 38:36.079
Let me see.

38:38.208 --> 38:41.167
Doesn't look good, boys.

38:41.208 --> 38:44.576
But Father, we need him
for the game tomorrow.

38:44.625 --> 38:46.161
Try not to stand on it.

38:47.875 --> 38:49.958
Let me in.

38:50.000 --> 38:51.207
Can you skate?

38:53.583 --> 38:54.869
When did you learn?

38:54.917 --> 38:57.500
By myself, after
shovelling the ice.

39:01.292 --> 39:03.625
All right. Let's see
what you can do.

39:21.083 --> 39:22.199
Yeah.

39:22.250 --> 39:23.411
Oh.

39:25.208 --> 39:26.665
How did you learn to do that?

39:26.708 --> 39:28.950
From those games on TV.

39:29.000 --> 39:31.208
That was a pretty snazzy move.

39:31.250 --> 39:32.536
You taught yourself that?

39:33.708 --> 39:34.949
Yeah.

39:37.208 --> 39:40.119
He's too young and too small
to be playing hockey.

39:40.167 --> 39:42.375
Father, he's the best
player on the rink.

39:42.417 --> 39:44.454
The others look up to him.

39:44.499 --> 39:47.537
No child is so special that it
warrants breaching our rules.

39:47.583 --> 39:49.916
I understand...

39:49.958 --> 39:51.665
But still...

39:58.833 --> 40:00.995
Saul.

40:01.917 --> 40:04.079
Yes. Yeah.

40:04.125 --> 40:06.833
I found a way out.
We can run away.

40:06.875 --> 40:08.787
I got a hockey game.

40:09.083 --> 40:10.870
We'll go in the bust.

40:10.917 --> 40:13.534
Trap a beaver and make a fire.

40:13.875 --> 40:15.741
I got to play.

40:18.417 --> 40:19.828
We can find my dad.

40:19.875 --> 40:23.787
We'll make a camp
and sleep outside.

40:25.000 --> 40:27.333
That'd be good but Lonnie,

40:27.375 --> 40:30.539
At breakfast I'll
meet you in front.

40:55.667 --> 40:57.454
Come on.

40:58.833 --> 41:00.290
Come on.

41:00.333 --> 41:01.369
I can't.

41:06.542 --> 41:07.542
Sorry, Lonnie.

41:08.333 --> 41:09.995
I got to go.

41:12.667 --> 41:14.158
Now, listen.

41:14.208 --> 41:16.245
This is our team's
first organised game.

41:16.292 --> 41:17.499
The other team is skilled,

41:17.542 --> 41:20.449
and they've been playing games
like this since they were six.

41:20.500 --> 41:24.582
So you go out there, play
for fun, play as a team.

41:24.625 --> 41:26.412
You ready?

41:26.458 --> 41:27.458
Yeah.

41:27.500 --> 41:28.957
Now, let's go, boys.

41:48.833 --> 41:49.833
Come on.

41:57.833 --> 42:01.656
Saul... you ready?

42:01.708 --> 42:02.708
Go.

42:07.875 --> 42:09.082
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

42:10.875 --> 42:12.457
Don't let him get it.

42:22.542 --> 42:23.623
Yeah.

42:23.667 --> 42:25.829
Yeah.

42:38.958 --> 42:40.494
Yeah.

42:40.542 --> 42:42.750
Oh.

42:50.667 --> 42:51.999
The game loves you, Saul.

42:52.042 --> 42:53.783
Well done.

42:53.833 --> 42:55.290
Well done.

42:59.875 --> 43:01.662
Come on.

43:23.708 --> 43:25.165
Come.

43:29.458 --> 43:31.040
Lonnie?

43:38.625 --> 43:40.287
It's all I could get.

43:52.958 --> 43:55.075
Time to go, Saul.

43:55.125 --> 43:57.833
Let him out. Please.

43:57.875 --> 44:00.492
I can't.

44:00.542 --> 44:02.625
Please?

44:02.667 --> 44:05.330
He can't take it in there.

44:06.375 --> 44:09.664
God forgive them their
lack of charity.

44:09.708 --> 44:12.371
Come.

44:56.375 --> 44:58.537
No.

45:26.875 --> 45:28.241
What are you up to now, Saul?

45:30.792 --> 45:32.158
Metal pipes.

45:32.208 --> 45:34.541
They weigh twice as
much as regular pucks.

45:36.208 --> 45:38.666
How long have you been doing this?

45:38.708 --> 45:40.165
About a month or so.

45:40.208 --> 45:42.996
A workman gave them to me.

45:43.042 --> 45:44.249
Make me stronger.

45:45.708 --> 45:47.165
Marvellous.

45:57.000 --> 45:58.491
Saul.

46:02.542 --> 46:03.874
Nice skating.

46:03.917 --> 46:05.078
Fred Kelly.

46:06.583 --> 46:10.332
Fred has a team, Saul,
up in Manitouwadge.

46:10.375 --> 46:11.661
The Moose.

46:11.708 --> 46:13.995
We play tournaments on
rinks just like this one,

46:14.042 --> 46:17.495
every weekend in the winter,
right up until breakup,

46:17.542 --> 46:21.869
or till the forwards have to
wear flippers instead of skates.

46:23.458 --> 46:25.074
Anyway...

46:25.125 --> 46:26.741
we love hockey.

46:26.792 --> 46:30.045
Trouble is, mill town teams don't
want nothing to do with us.

46:30.833 --> 46:32.995
Because you can beat them?

46:33.042 --> 46:35.250
Ah, because the white guys
think it's their game.

46:36.417 --> 46:39.956
The reserves take a lot
of pride in their teams.

46:40.000 --> 46:45.498
Even when it's 50-below,
there's a crowd out, watching.

46:45.542 --> 46:47.909
Tell him what you're
thinking, Mr Kelly.

46:47.958 --> 46:50.999
Most of our players, they
play junior-level hockey.

46:51.042 --> 46:53.329
Right now, we're down a centre.

46:53.375 --> 46:55.867
I was wondering if maybe...

46:55.917 --> 46:58.989
you'd like to play with us?

46:59.042 --> 47:00.518
Fred and his wife
lived at St. Jerome's

47:00.542 --> 47:04.709
for eight years, Saul, and
I told Fred about you.

47:04.750 --> 47:08.494
The Kellys offered to become
your legal guardians.

47:09.542 --> 47:13.992
That means you can leave St.
Jerome's and go to Manitouwadge.

47:14.042 --> 47:16.500
Attend a regular school.

47:16.542 --> 47:18.249
You'll have a home.

47:19.833 --> 47:21.574
A real home.

47:24.125 --> 47:25.741
And I could play hockey?

47:25.792 --> 47:28.535
All you can handle.

47:28.583 --> 47:30.040
Yes.

47:30.083 --> 47:31.574
Hockey is God's game.

47:31.625 --> 47:34.743
It's the perfect combination
between human skill and passion.

47:34.792 --> 47:37.000
That sport is brutal,
devoid of Christian values.

47:37.042 --> 47:38.829
Saul's talent is miraculous.

47:38.875 --> 47:42.158
Your responsibility is to
teach the children humility.

47:42.208 --> 47:45.249
Father, he'll have the benefit
of a good home and schooling.

47:45.292 --> 47:47.329
He has that here with us.

47:49.375 --> 47:52.038
I don't know why Our Lord
chose to grace this boy,

47:52.083 --> 47:54.540
but he did, and I've seen
it with my own eyes.

47:54.583 --> 47:57.200
That shot he made at the
White River game...

47:57.250 --> 47:59.037
That was a minor miracle.

47:59.083 --> 48:01.824
How does this miracle help him
with the rest of his life?

48:01.875 --> 48:05.074
Does it support his inner
strength, his faith in God?

48:05.125 --> 48:08.582
When the hockey ends, he'll
have nothing, he'll be in Hell.

48:08.625 --> 48:12.164
Sister, he has no relatives
that we know of.

48:12.208 --> 48:15.201
If his parents are still
alive, they've abandoned him.

48:15.250 --> 48:18.618
And now, to deny him
a nurturing family,

48:18.667 --> 48:21.661
or suppress God-given gifts,
that's not what we stand for.

48:21.708 --> 48:24.166
Father...

48:27.875 --> 48:30.162
Do you want to go, Saul?

48:44.667 --> 48:47.034
I'm going away, Lonnie.

48:49.875 --> 48:52.538
You're gonna be all right, okay?

48:54.333 --> 48:56.575
I want to go away too.

48:58.583 --> 48:59.824
Look, it won't be long.

48:59.875 --> 49:02.162
Summer comes, you'll be
old enough to leave here,

49:02.208 --> 49:03.790
and we'll find each other.

49:03.833 --> 49:04.833
No, we won't.

49:04.875 --> 49:06.832
Sure we will.

49:06.875 --> 49:10.574
Look, we'll go out in the bush,
we'll be trapping and fishing,

49:10.625 --> 49:12.992
and we won't come back.

49:13.875 --> 49:16.413
I want to go home.

49:25.833 --> 49:27.449
Goodbye.

49:39.167 --> 49:42.456
Saul... now, I've been thinking.

49:44.000 --> 49:46.492
Hockey...

49:46.542 --> 49:48.204
is like the universe.

49:49.292 --> 49:52.665
If we were right in the heart
of it, we'd see chaos.

49:52.708 --> 49:54.825
But you...

49:54.875 --> 49:57.242
you see the order, the path,

49:57.292 --> 49:59.079
the great spirit of the game.

49:59.125 --> 50:02.948
That's what makes you
so extraordinary, Saul.

50:03.000 --> 50:05.208
You have that spirit within you.

50:09.833 --> 50:11.540
You are glory, Saul.

50:14.542 --> 50:16.033
- Thank you, Father.
- Thanks, Fred.

50:34.708 --> 50:36.449
"Manitouwadge..."

50:36.500 --> 50:39.993
means "Cave of the Great Spirit."

50:40.042 --> 50:43.661
Funny, since everyone
works in the mine.

50:43.708 --> 50:45.995
That's why we're here.

50:46.042 --> 50:49.080
Tough place, but it's work.

50:49.125 --> 50:51.708
Next year, maybe
you'll work there too.

51:03.625 --> 51:05.742
What do you think?

51:07.583 --> 51:09.324
I like it.

51:09.375 --> 51:10.411
That's good.

51:10.458 --> 51:13.494
Took me and the boys a couple
years just to get that...

51:13.542 --> 51:15.158
Fred. For Pete's sake,

51:15.208 --> 51:18.497
the boy needs food
before he needs hockey.

51:18.542 --> 51:20.625
Come on in.

51:20.667 --> 51:21.783
Martha, this is Saul.

51:21.833 --> 51:25.782
Hi. Welcome to our home.

51:25.833 --> 51:28.075
Me and Martha have three sons.

51:28.125 --> 51:31.289
Virgil is the only one
that's still living at home,

51:31.333 --> 51:33.495
and he's captain of the Moose.

51:33.542 --> 51:34.783
Kinda small.

51:34.833 --> 51:37.075
Ah, he plays bigger.

51:37.125 --> 51:38.707
He'll want to.

51:41.917 --> 51:45.575
I bet it's been a while
since you've seen bannock.

51:47.458 --> 51:49.666
Here, son. Here.

51:51.416 --> 51:52.416
Jam?

51:52.417 --> 51:54.374
Sorry.

51:58.042 --> 52:01.456
So this used to be
Garrett's room...

52:03.083 --> 52:06.656
It's your room now, though, Saul.

52:06.708 --> 52:09.325
Is this the first time
you've had your own room?

52:11.000 --> 52:13.333
Is it all right?

52:15.667 --> 52:18.831
This is your home now.

52:18.875 --> 52:21.663
You're not in that place any more.

52:21.708 --> 52:23.665
You're safe here.

53:02.708 --> 53:05.496
Thank you.

53:10.458 --> 53:13.371
Welcome to the Moose, Saul.

53:15.042 --> 53:16.704
Number 13, for good luck.

53:16.750 --> 53:18.992
Here, try it on.

53:19.042 --> 53:20.999
I wore that when I
was with the Moose.

53:21.042 --> 53:22.954
Stand up.

53:26.708 --> 53:30.031
Every reserve in the
north had a hockey team.

53:30.083 --> 53:32.325
We travelled to tournaments
every few weeks.

53:32.375 --> 53:35.038
Each team paid about $10 to play,

53:35.083 --> 53:39.157
and the winner took
home a small purse.

53:39.208 --> 53:42.408
They were the fastest and most
fluid players I had ever seen.

53:42.458 --> 53:46.828
I was in awe of their
skill and strength,

53:46.875 --> 53:48.537
and more than a little nervous.

54:02.875 --> 54:05.538
That's what I call a game.

54:05.583 --> 54:07.245
Good game, Saul.

54:07.292 --> 54:09.375
All you guys, good game.

54:35.042 --> 54:37.125
Now, that's what I call a game.

54:37.167 --> 54:38.283
You didn't even score, man.

54:38.333 --> 54:40.825
Who cares? Bambi did.

54:47.542 --> 54:49.534
No overtime.

54:50.833 --> 54:52.540
Hey, Moose.

54:52.583 --> 54:55.121
The Johnson Mill Chiefs
are a Senior "A" team...

54:55.167 --> 54:56.499
all mill and mine workers.

54:56.542 --> 54:58.875
That don't mean they're any good.

54:58.917 --> 55:00.328
They're more than good.

55:00.375 --> 55:02.458
They were league
champions last year.

55:02.500 --> 55:03.957
Playing tough teams

55:04.000 --> 55:06.868
is the only way us Moose
are gonna get better.

55:06.883 --> 55:08.017
You think it's an brand-new arena?

55:08.018 --> 55:09.620
Definitely. I seen it.

55:09.667 --> 55:11.784
Real dressing rooms with
showers and toilets.

55:12.917 --> 55:14.829
Ernie'd go anywhere for a toilet.

55:22.250 --> 55:23.616
Ladies and gentlemen,

55:23.667 --> 55:26.831
tonight's visiting team,
the Manitouwadge Moose.

55:26.875 --> 55:28.286
It's just another game.

55:28.333 --> 55:30.120
Don't make it bigger
in your heads.

55:30.167 --> 55:31.658
Play it like you always do.

55:31.708 --> 55:35.122
Be Moose. Be Indians.

55:39.208 --> 55:41.495
And now, your Johnson Mill team.

57:43.917 --> 57:45.309
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Stay put, stay put.

57:45.333 --> 57:46.494
You're the first star.

57:46.542 --> 57:47.874
What's that?

57:47.917 --> 57:50.034
There's three stars, like
on Hockey Night in Canada.

57:50.083 --> 57:51.619
You got to go back out there.

57:51.667 --> 57:52.828
No, I don't.

57:52.875 --> 57:54.616
Have to. It's tradition.

57:56.292 --> 57:57.783
Go.

58:02.542 --> 58:04.809
Ladies and gentlemen, the
first star of the game,

58:04.833 --> 58:09.999
Saul Indian Horse.

58:12.208 --> 58:14.792
We just got a challenge
from another white team.

58:15.667 --> 58:17.454
Everybody's gonna want to play us.

58:17.500 --> 58:19.662
Guess those boys like
getting their asses kicked.

58:23.708 --> 58:24.744
What?

58:27.250 --> 58:30.914
They got shocked
seeing Indians skate.

58:30.958 --> 58:35.032
Think it's their game. Not ours.

58:35.083 --> 58:38.999
They play for the same
reasons we do, the feeling.

58:39.042 --> 58:41.534
Nobody owns that.

58:50.542 --> 58:52.875
Manitouwadge Moose.

58:52.917 --> 58:55.660
Welcome to Honky Night
in Canada, boys.

58:55.708 --> 58:56.915
Come on, boys. Come on.

58:56.958 --> 58:58.309
Anybody spears you
is gonna pay for it.

58:58.333 --> 59:00.040
Don't matter. I'll
keep finding the net.

59:00.083 --> 59:03.281
Let them get the
penalties, not us.

59:03.333 --> 59:04.833
Number 13. You're gonna
need an Indian hearse.

59:06.542 --> 59:07.828
I'm sick of this.

59:07.875 --> 59:09.207
Gonna scalp you, Indians.

59:09.250 --> 59:11.663
That "Indian hearse" line
was pretty good, though.

59:11.708 --> 59:13.995
Blanket-ass. Waggon-burner.

59:14.042 --> 59:15.954
Nice friendly town they got here.

59:21.708 --> 59:22.708
Pitcher of beer?

59:35.708 --> 59:37.540
Did someone die?

59:38.708 --> 59:40.495
The old Moose knuckle sandwich.

59:40.542 --> 59:41.623
Yeah.

59:41.667 --> 59:43.184
I'm hungry enough to
eat an Indian Horse.

59:43.208 --> 59:45.746
Them other guys sure
wanted a bite of him.

59:45.792 --> 59:47.283
Yeah. It's a good thing your face

59:47.333 --> 59:49.370
got in the way of that guy's fist?

59:51.375 --> 59:54.664
If it ain't the squaw-hoppers.

01:00:00.167 --> 01:00:01.658
Win a little hockey tournament

01:00:01.708 --> 01:00:04.951
and think you can come in here
and eat like white people?

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.663
What the hell you want?

01:00:07.708 --> 01:00:11.120
You want to eat here, you're
gonna have to fight for it.

01:00:11.167 --> 01:00:12.658
Is that right?

01:00:22.542 --> 01:00:24.454
Sounds fun.

01:00:24.500 --> 01:00:26.742
Save my spot, Saul.

01:00:26.792 --> 01:00:28.249
I'll be right back.

01:00:28.292 --> 01:00:30.579
You play a hell of a
game, little star.

01:00:30.625 --> 01:00:32.662
That and the fact you're
a kid gives you a pass.

01:00:37.042 --> 01:00:39.659
Wait your turn.

01:00:39.708 --> 01:00:41.540
You can go next.

01:01:12.083 --> 01:01:14.040
Are you okay?

01:01:14.083 --> 01:01:16.370
What happened?

01:01:18.208 --> 01:01:20.416
Let's get out of here.

01:01:25.042 --> 01:01:27.159
Your turn.

01:01:35.583 --> 01:01:36.583
Let's go.

01:01:40.500 --> 01:01:41.500
Hey.

01:02:30.750 --> 01:02:32.992
One thing for sure...

01:02:33.042 --> 01:02:36.991
those were the tiniest bunch
of pricks I ever seen.

01:03:05.042 --> 01:03:06.408
Saul?

01:03:10.333 --> 01:03:11.665
Saul.

01:03:15.750 --> 01:03:18.367
Saul. We got to go.

01:03:18.417 --> 01:03:20.033
Move it, man. Everybody's waiting.

01:03:23.542 --> 01:03:25.249
Coming.

01:03:35.292 --> 01:03:36.703
Stop taking that cheap shit.

01:03:36.750 --> 01:03:37.790
You're not a runt any more.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.458
We're gonna scalp you, Injuns.

01:03:56.417 --> 01:04:00.081
Guy's the coach for
that Toronto Monarchs.

01:04:00.125 --> 01:04:01.991
It's a feeder team
for the Maple Leafs.

01:04:02.042 --> 01:04:04.830
Says he'd like to
talk to you, Saul.

01:04:04.875 --> 01:04:06.366
About what?

01:04:10.625 --> 01:04:12.662
Jack Lanahan?

01:04:12.708 --> 01:04:13.949
Saul Indian Horse.

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:15.000
Hi, Saul.

01:04:15.042 --> 01:04:17.455
I'll leave you two to it.

01:04:19.167 --> 01:04:21.250
So, Fred tell you why I'm here?

01:04:21.292 --> 01:04:23.158
Some.

01:04:24.792 --> 01:04:26.328
I'd like you to play for my team.

01:04:26.375 --> 01:04:27.991
What do you think about that?

01:04:28.042 --> 01:04:30.250
Not much.

01:04:36.417 --> 01:04:41.162
With the right coaching and
environment, you could play pro.

01:04:41.208 --> 01:04:42.574
You're incredibly fast.

01:04:42.625 --> 01:04:45.117
You have a puck sense like
I've never seen before.

01:04:45.167 --> 01:04:46.999
I'm happy playing with The Moose.

01:04:50.083 --> 01:04:53.372
The great players are
conjurers, Saul.

01:04:53.417 --> 01:04:59.240
They become one with the
game, and it lifts them up

01:04:59.292 --> 01:05:01.033
and out of their lives.

01:05:02.875 --> 01:05:05.663
That's what happens
to you, isn't it?

01:05:07.667 --> 01:05:09.033
Yeah.

01:05:09.083 --> 01:05:10.699
You make the ice
work for you, Saul.

01:05:10.750 --> 01:05:12.958
That's why you should be
playing at a higher level.

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.083
You're wasted here.

01:05:18.292 --> 01:05:20.409
So what the hell happened?

01:05:22.167 --> 01:05:24.580
He wants me in Toronto.

01:05:27.125 --> 01:05:29.091
When's it start? When you going?

01:05:29.092 --> 01:05:30.092
I'm not.

01:05:30.208 --> 01:05:31.949
What? You're kidding.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:33.241
Don't want to.

01:05:33.292 --> 01:05:34.954
Look, Bambi. That don't matter.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:36.207
You got called.

01:05:36.250 --> 01:05:38.019
We all play the game
wishing someday we'll

01:05:38.021 --> 01:05:39.665
get the call to play
with the big boys.

01:05:39.708 --> 01:05:40.739
Bambi.

01:05:40.740 --> 01:05:42.324
I'm 26.

01:05:42.375 --> 01:05:44.226
I've been working graveyards
in the freaking mines

01:05:44.250 --> 01:05:45.491
since I was 16 years old.

01:05:45.542 --> 01:05:49.161
You've got to give it
a shot for all of us.

01:05:49.208 --> 01:05:50.995
If you don't go, you're a coward.

01:05:51.042 --> 01:05:53.125
Let it beat you
without even trying.

01:05:53.167 --> 01:05:55.665
And if you stay, I'll be
the one doing the beating.

01:05:56.875 --> 01:05:58.457
What if I don't cut it?

01:06:00.041 --> 01:06:01.041
You will.

01:06:01.042 --> 01:06:02.908
You believe that?

01:06:02.958 --> 01:06:05.325
I ain't the one who's
got to believe it.

01:06:11.083 --> 01:06:13.325
It's time to go.

01:06:18.333 --> 01:06:20.825
Saul...

01:06:20.875 --> 01:06:24.118
I know you're torn about going.

01:06:30.875 --> 01:06:34.164
I am so proud of you.

01:06:36.125 --> 01:06:40.455
It takes great courage to
take something like this on.

01:06:41.708 --> 01:06:45.657
I know you'll do good.

01:06:45.708 --> 01:06:47.995
So let's go.

01:06:57.750 --> 01:07:01.204
Some bannock and some
food for your trip.

01:07:04.833 --> 01:07:07.371
Saul, don't forget us.

01:07:13.125 --> 01:07:15.663
I'm gonna miss this place.

01:07:15.708 --> 01:07:17.199
Manitouwadge?

01:07:17.250 --> 01:07:18.707
Nothing to miss, really.

01:07:18.750 --> 01:07:20.537
I feel like I grew up here.

01:07:20.583 --> 01:07:22.324
Guess you did.

01:07:22.375 --> 01:07:25.038
You were a pup when you got here.

01:07:27.667 --> 01:07:28.787
You're like a brother to me.

01:07:32.250 --> 01:07:34.116
I had a brother once.

01:07:34.167 --> 01:07:37.285
What happened to him?

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.993
My dad never talks
about the school.

01:07:44.042 --> 01:07:45.749
Mum neither.

01:07:45.792 --> 01:07:48.829
And they don't say nothing about
what happened before that.

01:07:48.875 --> 01:07:52.619
Same as you.

01:07:52.667 --> 01:07:55.574
Maybe this is your chance to
rub the shit off the board

01:07:55.625 --> 01:07:57.116
once and for all.

01:07:58.625 --> 01:08:02.448
Okay, let's get this
show on the road.

01:08:10.249 --> 01:08:11.249
Virgil...

01:08:11.250 --> 01:08:13.913
thanks for everything.

01:08:13.958 --> 01:08:15.290
Don't sound so damn final, Bambi.

01:08:15.333 --> 01:08:17.416
You can come back any time.

01:09:09.332 --> 01:09:10.332
Hey.

01:09:10.375 --> 01:09:11.991
Fred.

01:09:12.042 --> 01:09:14.500
You take good care of this kid.

01:09:14.542 --> 01:09:16.078
He's special.

01:09:17.167 --> 01:09:18.703
Welcome to Toronto, Saul.

01:09:18.750 --> 01:09:20.232
This is my wife, Elissa.

01:09:20.233 --> 01:09:21.233
Hi, Saul.

01:09:21.292 --> 01:09:22.533
First time in the big city?

01:09:22.582 --> 01:09:23.594
Yeah.

01:09:23.595 --> 01:09:25.033
Remember.

01:09:25.082 --> 01:09:27.991
You were a part of my
family for many years...

01:09:28.042 --> 01:09:30.658
and you always will be.

01:09:36.042 --> 01:09:38.705
You give it your best.

01:09:44.082 --> 01:09:45.415
All right.

01:09:45.457 --> 01:09:47.323
Just, make yourself at home.

01:09:47.375 --> 01:09:49.832
The kitchen's that
way, fridge is full.

01:09:49.875 --> 01:09:52.332
I'll go get you something.

01:09:53.792 --> 01:09:56.205
Come on. I'll show you your room.

01:10:01.333 --> 01:10:03.165
They all played for you?

01:10:03.208 --> 01:10:04.744
They all stayed here.

01:10:04.792 --> 01:10:09.375
They played for me on the
Monarchs, and ended up in the NHL.

01:10:22.083 --> 01:10:24.575
A lot of great players
have slept in that bed.

01:10:25.917 --> 01:10:28.309
They're saying Reggie Leach is
gonna tear up the record books.

01:10:28.333 --> 01:10:30.370
He's an Indian kid just like you.

01:10:30.417 --> 01:10:31.999
Oh yeah?

01:10:32.042 --> 01:10:33.999
So there's been a trail
blazed for you, Saul.

01:10:58.375 --> 01:11:00.207
So you had your choice of numbers

01:11:00.250 --> 01:11:02.663
and you picked the only
one nobody ever wants?

01:11:04.583 --> 01:11:05.824
I always had this number.

01:11:05.875 --> 01:11:07.958
You don't think it's bad luck?

01:11:11.208 --> 01:11:13.666
All right, men. See you out there.

01:11:13.708 --> 01:11:15.620
Let's go, boys.

01:11:15.667 --> 01:11:16.667
Hustle out there, guys.

01:11:16.708 --> 01:11:17.736
Stick to the game plan, guys.

01:11:17.737 --> 01:11:18.949
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:20.957
You make me look bad, I'll
knock your lights out.

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:24.289
Big game out there, big game.

01:11:37.417 --> 01:11:38.498
Come on.

01:12:03.625 --> 01:12:06.663
They wrote you up.

01:12:07.875 --> 01:12:09.787
"Bright-eyed like
a painted warrior

01:12:09.833 --> 01:12:11.870
bearing down on a waggon train.

01:12:11.917 --> 01:12:15.365
In a tussle, he took
a player's scalp."

01:12:17.208 --> 01:12:19.074
These guys have a way with words.

01:12:19.125 --> 01:12:20.787
And you told the reporter

01:12:20.833 --> 01:12:23.826
you learnt how to shoot
with a frozen horse turd.

01:12:23.875 --> 01:12:25.491
Is that true?

01:12:25.542 --> 01:12:26.542
Yeah.

01:12:29.458 --> 01:12:31.666
That's one way to
learn stickhandling.

01:12:40.875 --> 01:12:42.582
Don't worry about that, Saul.

01:12:42.625 --> 01:12:46.164
They've just never seen
anyone like you before.

01:13:47.333 --> 01:13:49.290
Saul.

01:13:59.417 --> 01:14:03.333
I've been following you
with the Monarchs.

01:14:03.375 --> 01:14:06.749
I can't believe I'm reading
about you in the newspapers.

01:14:07.917 --> 01:14:11.993
A month into the season,
and you're already a star.

01:14:12.042 --> 01:14:14.534
You're doing what you
always did, Saul...

01:14:14.583 --> 01:14:17.451
you're making the
other players better.

01:14:17.500 --> 01:14:22.620
It's a miracle how
far you've come.

01:14:24.042 --> 01:14:26.580
I'm so proud of you.

01:14:26.625 --> 01:14:30.164
I wish I could keep
following your career,

01:14:30.208 --> 01:14:34.873
but the Church is sending me away.

01:14:34.917 --> 01:14:36.249
Where are you going?

01:14:36.292 --> 01:14:38.705
Africa.

01:14:38.750 --> 01:14:41.413
To teach.

01:14:44.083 --> 01:14:46.450
I... just wanted you to know.

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.242
The school...

01:15:11.167 --> 01:15:13.124
What was happening there...

01:15:21.167 --> 01:15:23.454
It was wrong.

01:15:37.500 --> 01:15:39.708
You are glory, Saul.

01:17:50.042 --> 01:17:51.704
Keep your head up, Chief.

01:18:30.875 --> 01:18:32.662
Break it up.

01:18:42.333 --> 01:18:45.292
Any more penalties,
he's out of the game.

01:18:54.083 --> 01:18:58.248
You've got 22 points
in nine games.

01:18:59.375 --> 01:19:00.832
Thanks.

01:19:00.875 --> 01:19:02.366
We've lost seven of them.

01:19:02.417 --> 01:19:03.908
You blaming me?

01:19:03.958 --> 01:19:06.996
You've sat 120 minutes
in the penalty box.

01:19:07.042 --> 01:19:08.351
I didn't bring you
here to be a goon.

01:19:08.375 --> 01:19:10.867
I'm giving them what they
want, the crazy Redskin.

01:19:10.917 --> 01:19:12.658
You're letting the
other teams rattle you

01:19:12.708 --> 01:19:13.915
with stupid trash talk.

01:19:13.958 --> 01:19:15.665
You know how to roll off a hit?

01:19:15.708 --> 01:19:16.824
It's the same thing.

01:19:16.825 --> 01:19:18.674
And what about the shit that's
coming from my own team?

01:19:18.675 --> 01:19:20.285
You're not skating with
your buddies any more.

01:19:20.286 --> 01:19:22.744
These guys may be hard
towing now, but believe me,

01:19:22.792 --> 01:19:24.954
they'll take you
to the next level.

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:26.662
My buddies I could trust.

01:19:26.708 --> 01:19:28.665
They had my back.

01:19:28.708 --> 01:19:29.869
Saul...

01:19:29.917 --> 01:19:32.284
every kid dreams of this moment.

01:19:35.417 --> 01:19:38.956
I had dreams once.

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.492
I don't have them any more.

01:19:41.542 --> 01:19:43.249
Saul, listen.

01:19:43.292 --> 01:19:45.519
I know it's not
easy, but if Reggie

01:19:45.521 --> 01:19:47.375
Leach can do it, you can too.

01:19:47.417 --> 01:19:51.876
I promise you, get through
this, everything changes.

01:19:51.917 --> 01:19:54.703
You're gonna make it to the show,
then you'll be a role model

01:19:54.750 --> 01:19:55.750
for your kind.

01:19:55.792 --> 01:19:56.953
My "kind"?

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:58.161
Yes. An inspiration.

01:19:58.208 --> 01:20:00.120
You don't know a
damn thing about me.

01:20:00.167 --> 01:20:02.875
All I need to know is you
got a gift like no other.

01:20:02.917 --> 01:20:04.124
I've seen you on the ice.

01:20:04.167 --> 01:20:07.791
I know what you can do, I
know how it makes you feel,

01:20:07.833 --> 01:20:09.950
and I'm not blind to the
fact that it's killing you

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:11.366
not to play the way you can.

01:20:11.417 --> 01:20:14.708
You got no idea what kills
me or my "kind," do you?

01:20:14.750 --> 01:20:16.457
Listen to me, Saul.

01:20:16.500 --> 01:20:19.823
It's all sitting
right there for you.

01:20:19.875 --> 01:20:21.832
This is your way out.

01:20:21.875 --> 01:20:26.666
Your way to a better life.

01:20:26.708 --> 01:20:30.702
There is no better life for me.

01:20:30.750 --> 01:20:32.161
There never will be.

01:21:26.042 --> 01:21:31.367
I became a wandering nomad
with my eyes on distant hills.

01:21:31.417 --> 01:21:34.785
I covered long charcoal
stretches of highway...

01:21:34.833 --> 01:21:36.620
like a river

01:21:36.667 --> 01:21:39.501
bearing me somewhere
beyond all recollection.

01:21:46.333 --> 01:21:47.995
Lonnie?

01:22:07.167 --> 01:22:10.617
It was a dim world, and
I felt dead inside.

01:22:12.208 --> 01:22:14.120
Beyond thinking...

01:22:14.167 --> 01:22:17.001
beyond emotion...

01:22:17.042 --> 01:22:18.749
beyond hope.

01:22:32.625 --> 01:22:36.617
You drink down, because after
all the roads you've travelled,

01:22:36.667 --> 01:22:39.501
that's the only direction
you know by heart.

01:23:12.042 --> 01:23:13.158
You can't sleep here.

01:23:13.208 --> 01:23:14.790
Hey. You've got to get up.

01:23:28.917 --> 01:23:33.074
You've made a mess of
your body and your liver.

01:23:33.125 --> 01:23:35.617
Another bout of drinking
will likely kill you.

01:23:38.042 --> 01:23:40.125
The Rising Dawn Centre's
just north of the city.

01:23:40.167 --> 01:23:41.533
It's the best place

01:23:41.583 --> 01:23:43.791
for Native people to get
help for their addictions.

01:23:43.833 --> 01:23:47.166
Now, they've said they'll
take you, if you want it.

01:23:51.417 --> 01:23:53.204
Good luck.

01:24:05.042 --> 01:24:06.499
Then the cops...

01:24:06.542 --> 01:24:09.034
they put me in that...

01:24:10.417 --> 01:24:12.625
foster home.

01:24:12.667 --> 01:24:19.074
I haven't seen my family since.

01:24:21.083 --> 01:24:23.325
My grandma...

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.583
She could be dead.

01:24:31.042 --> 01:24:34.331
I been too drunk to be looking.

01:24:37.542 --> 01:24:39.329
Miigwech.

01:24:39.375 --> 01:24:42.539
Thank you. Thank you, Karen.

01:24:44.999 --> 01:24:45.999
Saul?

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.162
Would you like to share?

01:24:55.042 --> 01:24:56.042
Have you ever wept, Saul?

01:25:00.375 --> 01:25:02.708
No.

01:25:04.208 --> 01:25:06.165
You need to find a
place where you can.

01:25:07.875 --> 01:25:10.208
Here with us, or on your own...

01:25:10.250 --> 01:25:12.458
but you need to find it.

01:25:15.667 --> 01:25:18.034
Your silence is killing you.

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:31.832
He's a heathen.

01:26:31.875 --> 01:26:33.992
Anishnaabe aawi.

01:26:34.042 --> 01:26:36.534
That's a good boy.

01:26:46.333 --> 01:26:48.165
That's mine. That's mine.

01:27:39.792 --> 01:27:42.832
It's so good to see you so
excited about something.

01:27:51.708 --> 01:27:54.746
Rules are rules.

01:27:54.792 --> 01:27:57.954
If I break them for you, it
could ruin it for everybody.

01:27:59.042 --> 01:28:02.581
Sometimes, ghosts linger.

01:28:04.458 --> 01:28:07.530
They hover in the
furthest corners...

01:28:08.667 --> 01:28:13.415
And when you least expect
it, they lurch out,

01:28:13.458 --> 01:28:17.158
bearing everything they brought
to you when they were alive.

01:28:21.750 --> 01:28:23.662
What have you got, Saul?

01:28:24.792 --> 01:28:26.499
What is it?

01:28:26.542 --> 01:28:28.374
Horse turd.

01:28:29.667 --> 01:28:31.454
Oh.

01:28:32.917 --> 01:28:34.658
Marvellous.

01:28:48.542 --> 01:28:49.828
Come.

01:29:11.583 --> 01:29:13.666
You are glory, Saul.

01:30:46.708 --> 01:30:52.167
I came far to make this journey.

01:30:56.542 --> 01:31:00.582
I could feel my family
and my ancestors.

01:31:06.958 --> 01:31:08.665
It was here,

01:31:08.708 --> 01:31:10.995
in this place...

01:31:11.042 --> 01:31:14.661
where everything started

01:31:14.708 --> 01:31:15.708
and everything ended.

01:31:28.875 --> 01:31:32.198
I was with them again.

01:31:40.167 --> 01:31:42.329
Mama.

01:31:45.375 --> 01:31:47.162
Papa.

01:32:22.875 --> 01:32:27.114
One day, my great-grandfather,
Shabogeesick,

01:32:27.167 --> 01:32:31.366
walked out of the bush leading
a strange black animal.

01:32:33.250 --> 01:32:39.250
Our people had never seen such
a creature, and were afraid.

01:32:40.958 --> 01:32:43.291
"It is a horse," he told them,

01:32:43.333 --> 01:32:46.747
"and it comes bearing
great teachings."

01:32:48.708 --> 01:32:52.076
"A thunder will crash through
our hearts and minds,

01:32:52.125 --> 01:32:56.199
and we must learn to ride
the horses of change."

01:32:57.875 --> 01:33:01.414
"It is what the
future asks of us."

01:33:02.458 --> 01:33:05.041
"Our survival depends on it."

01:33:07.042 --> 01:33:09.876
Guys, let's do this.
Let's do this.

01:33:10.958 --> 01:33:12.824
Come on, look alive, look alive.

01:33:12.875 --> 01:33:15.788
Welcome to the Moose, Saul.

01:33:17.333 --> 01:33:18.744
You always have a home here.

01:33:22.125 --> 01:33:24.162
What do you think?

01:33:35.792 --> 01:33:37.283
Hey.

01:33:38.417 --> 01:33:40.579
Look who's here.

01:33:40.625 --> 01:33:42.457
Saul.

01:33:42.500 --> 01:33:44.082
Welcome back.

01:33:47.542 --> 01:33:49.704
Welcome home, Bambi.

01:33:49.750 --> 01:33:51.082
Hey, boys.

01:33:51.125 --> 01:33:52.616
Look who's here.

01:33:56.583 --> 01:33:58.495
About time.

01:34:02.292 --> 01:34:03.999
Hey-hey.

01:34:04.042 --> 01:34:05.999
Look who's here.

01:34:06.042 --> 01:34:07.070
Good to see you, buddy.

01:34:07.071 --> 01:34:08.408
Still a bag of antlers.

01:34:10.208 --> 01:34:11.915
Good to see you too.

01:34:23.208 --> 01:34:24.851
They were lost. They
didn't understand.

01:34:24.875 --> 01:34:26.286
They didn't recognise
their parents.

01:34:26.333 --> 01:34:28.143
They didn't recognise
anybody in their community.

01:34:28.167 --> 01:34:29.253
Why was I like that?

01:34:29.254 --> 01:34:30.332
Why didn't I speak up?

01:34:30.375 --> 01:34:32.162
To this day, there's a lot of us

01:34:32.208 --> 01:34:34.575
that don't know how to
speak our native tongue.

01:34:34.625 --> 01:34:38.991
If you succeed in going
to school, that's great.

01:34:39.042 --> 01:34:42.291
But I want my grandchildren
to know where I've been,

01:34:42.333 --> 01:34:45.201
and, why I do the
things that I do.

01:34:45.250 --> 01:34:47.116
It's up to we as a community

01:34:47.167 --> 01:34:50.239
to bring back or have
that pride in our souls.

01:34:50.292 --> 01:34:52.033
We have a beautiful,
