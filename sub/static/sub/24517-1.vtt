00:28.500 --> 00:30.133
Easy.

00:30.266 --> 00:32.100
Wake up.

00:32.200 --> 00:33.366
Nina!

00:39.466 --> 00:40.933
We'll get dressed.

00:42.866 --> 00:44.400
Did you stain it?

00:49.233 --> 00:50.633
Will we glue?

00:51.366 --> 00:52.333
Glue?

01:09.933 --> 01:12.033
<i>My name is Nadezhda Kutepova</i>

01:12.100 --> 01:14.100
<i>and I'm a native of Ozersk.</i>

01:14.166 --> 01:15.900
<i>I was born here.</i>

01:17.933 --> 01:22.500
<i>My mother used to warn me, "Darling,</i>
<i>never say where you are from...</i>

01:23.666 --> 01:27.033
<i>or a Black Maria will take us away</i>
<i>and you'll never see your parents again."</i>

01:30.500 --> 01:32.933
<i>We were told we lived in a secret place.</i>

01:35.466 --> 01:39.000
<i>There were spies all over,</i>
<i>sneaking around, gathering information.</i>

01:44.400 --> 01:46.200
<i>My mother told me,</i>

01:46.266 --> 01:48.700
<i>"Let state secrets stay secret."</i>

03:44.500 --> 03:48.033
As I was growing up as a kid
in the city of Chelyabinsk,

03:48.366 --> 03:51.433
I was aware of the existence

03:51.500 --> 03:53.266
of another world,

03:54.066 --> 03:58.233
a strange place, a closed place,

03:58.466 --> 04:00.700
a top-secret place.

04:01.433 --> 04:05.433
<i>The city was called Ozersk at that time</i>

04:05.966 --> 04:07.966
<i>but I never</i>

04:08.533 --> 04:10.666
<i>heard that name as a kid,</i>

04:11.100 --> 04:14.466
<i>because everybody referred to it</i>
<i>as Chelyabinsk-40...</i>

04:14.933 --> 04:16.600
<i>or City 40.</i>

04:17.000 --> 04:19.132
<i>City no. 40 was the name everybody used.</i>

04:20.100 --> 04:22.700
It was not until 1994...

04:23.433 --> 04:26.366
that I understood
that this was actually the place

04:26.566 --> 04:29.166
where they made the plutonium bomb.

04:50.466 --> 04:52.300
<i>A town in South Ural, Russia.</i>

04:52.800 --> 04:56.566
<i>It has a population of almost 100,000.</i>

04:58.066 --> 05:01.600
<i>The town has streets, avenues,</i>
<i>parks and squares...</i>

05:01.833 --> 05:04.133
<i>stadiums, gyms,</i>

05:04.533 --> 05:06.233
<i>theaters and museums.</i>

05:07.233 --> 05:10.366
<i>It reminds you of some peaceful</i>

05:10.433 --> 05:13.066
<i>resort town, doesn't it?</i>

05:20.700 --> 05:22.933
<i>My parents had good friends</i>

05:23.000 --> 05:25.900
<i>who lived in Ozersk, or in City no. 40.</i>

05:26.833 --> 05:28.133
<i>They came to visit us</i>

05:28.200 --> 05:31.666
<i>and they told us that they lived</i>
<i>in a very beautiful city.</i>

05:32.266 --> 05:35.600
But we never visited them back,

05:36.933 --> 05:40.266
and my parents explained to me
that this was not possible

05:40.866 --> 05:42.966
because this was a very special place

05:43.333 --> 05:44.800
that couldn't be reached

05:45.033 --> 05:48.000
by train or by bus from Chelyabinsk.

05:48.333 --> 05:50.533
They said it was, like,

05:50.866 --> 05:52.366
a one-way thing,

05:52.833 --> 05:54.066
so these people could visit us,

05:54.133 --> 05:56.166
but we could never see the place
where they lived.

06:26.666 --> 06:28.933
<i>What are these closed cities?</i>

06:31.700 --> 06:34.300
<i>Each is a state within a state.</i>

06:39.833 --> 06:44.333
Even inside such fenced-off cities

06:44.533 --> 06:48.300
there are separate facilities,

06:48.600 --> 06:51.533
which are also fenced off.

06:55.500 --> 06:57.300
<i>People in these cities</i>

06:57.933 --> 07:00.766
<i>can exit the city,</i>

07:01.000 --> 07:03.433
<i>but it takes a special pass.</i>

07:14.766 --> 07:16.200
<i>This City 40 is</i>

07:16.266 --> 07:19.366
<i>where almost all reserve</i>
<i>of Russia's nuclear materials</i>

07:19.433 --> 07:21.400
<i>is stockpiled.</i>

07:22.800 --> 07:25.366
<i>The system cuts off attempts</i>

07:25.466 --> 07:27.766
<i>at unauthorized access</i>

07:27.833 --> 07:29.866
<i>at an early stage.</i>

07:31.466 --> 07:34.200
<i>Unauthorized access there</i>

07:34.266 --> 07:36.533
<i>cannot even be imagined.</i>

07:42.233 --> 07:45.233
I read about a tell-tale sign
how you know someone is a terrorist.

07:45.866 --> 07:49.066
They are usually dressed warmer
than necessary.

07:53.600 --> 07:56.566
<i>To get in there,</i>

07:56.766 --> 07:58.800
<i>you would need...</i>

07:59.633 --> 08:01.566
<i>a full-scale army operation,</i>

08:01.666 --> 08:05.500
<i>with major assault force,</i>
<i>tanks and everything.</i>

08:57.333 --> 08:59.600
<i>It's a cozy town.</i>

09:01.566 --> 09:03.566
<i>It's a cozy and beautiful town.</i>

09:06.400 --> 09:07.500
But a closed one.

09:11.466 --> 09:14.200
For instance, it was problematic
for you to enter.

10:05.633 --> 10:08.133
<i>Our town is a town of intellectuals.</i>

10:11.300 --> 10:14.133
You can't buy them for anything.

10:14.200 --> 10:16.433
They are...

10:16.766 --> 10:19.233
getting a good education.

10:19.300 --> 10:22.466
The schools have good funding.

10:22.666 --> 10:25.066
They also get good health care,

10:25.133 --> 10:28.000
even if it is getting worse now.

10:28.100 --> 10:32.000
Our citizens are used to the very best.

10:34.533 --> 10:38.233
<i>A closed city implies not only</i>
<i>the comforts of life...</i>

10:40.833 --> 10:44.066
<i>but also implies safety.</i>

10:49.200 --> 10:50.933
<i>Here, in this city,</i>

10:51.000 --> 10:53.766
<i>we can let our children go out</i>
<i>at 11:00 p.m. without worries...</i>

10:53.833 --> 10:57.733
<i>something that people in other towns</i>
<i>cannot do.</i>

11:00.500 --> 11:04.500
<i>Their children have to be accompanied.</i>

11:08.566 --> 11:14.966
<i>The people who were born here stay here.</i>

11:22.066 --> 11:23.266
Do you want it?

11:23.766 --> 11:24.933
Some more.

11:26.433 --> 11:27.600
Share with your brother.

11:30.800 --> 11:32.733
Be careful.

11:32.800 --> 11:34.466
You will be dirty.

11:38.066 --> 11:39.366
I want sour cream.

11:39.833 --> 11:42.633
What sour cream? Only yogurt.

11:42.733 --> 11:45.600
We're out of sour cream.
We'll have it this evening.

11:45.666 --> 11:46.933
I want sour cream.

11:47.033 --> 11:48.833
It's with raspberries, look.

11:49.800 --> 11:51.900
See how tasty it is with raspberries?

12:11.166 --> 12:14.866
<i>We have a woman here, Nadezhda Kutepova.</i>

12:17.500 --> 12:20.566
<i>She is a human rights activist...</i>

12:22.033 --> 12:23.866
<i>who fights for the opening of the city.</i>

12:25.966 --> 12:30.600
She once asked me, "Aren't you concerned
with the barbed wire?

12:32.433 --> 12:34.066
<i>It violates your rights."</i>

12:37.533 --> 12:39.266
<i>I told her...</i>

12:40.066 --> 12:41.500
<i>"My rights are not violated.</i>

12:42.300 --> 12:43.933
Read my lips,"

12:44.033 --> 12:45.300
as President Reagan would say

12:45.366 --> 12:47.700
when they asked him too many questions.

12:48.033 --> 12:50.266
"My rights are not violated."

12:58.333 --> 13:01.366
<i>I like people who are stubborn</i>
<i>and firm in their positions.</i>

13:03.033 --> 13:04.633
But I don't like crazy people.

13:15.200 --> 13:18.966
<i>I work in two fields,</i>
<i>human rights in closed cities...</i>

13:20.133 --> 13:23.066
<i>and the rights of people</i>
<i>affected by radiation.</i>

13:30.833 --> 13:31.900
Nadezhda,

13:32.000 --> 13:34.033
when Romashov comes, let's comfort him.

13:34.100 --> 13:37.300
With Romashov, we'll have a therapeutic
talk. Did he get the court decision?

13:37.366 --> 13:39.666
No. Today he will come
and tell us everything.

13:39.766 --> 13:41.533
I asked him to please come.

13:41.666 --> 13:45.800
They have done something. Poor thing.

13:46.466 --> 13:48.900
He asked me to call. I called the judge.

13:49.300 --> 13:51.666
It seemed like she was writing
the decision that moment.

13:52.433 --> 13:53.700
And she asked me,

13:54.333 --> 13:56.700
"Nadezhda, please, explain to me..."

13:56.766 --> 13:59.566
-Who was it?
-Let's not say who it was. A judge.

13:59.633 --> 14:01.433
I thought to myself,

14:01.533 --> 14:04.033
well, read the name of the law!

14:05.900 --> 14:08.366
<i>I run an organization,</i>

14:08.433 --> 14:10.500
<i>"Planet of Hopes," in Ozersk.</i>

14:11.133 --> 14:13.200
<i>Officially, the authorities</i>
<i>don't recognize us,</i>

14:13.266 --> 14:15.533
<i>because we're "enemies of the city."</i>

14:16.533 --> 14:18.066
<i>But whenever a city officer,</i>

14:18.133 --> 14:21.066
<i>or their friends or relatives run into</i>
<i>serious legal problems,</i>

14:21.900 --> 14:26.166
<i>they come to us,</i>
<i>because no one else would help.</i>

14:27.533 --> 14:31.900
<i>For many people,</i>
<i>there is no one else to confide in.</i>

14:35.700 --> 14:39.433
<i>I work in the reception room,</i>
<i>greeting people.</i>

14:39.966 --> 14:41.433
It's fun working with her.

14:42.100 --> 14:44.900
She has the same character as myself.

14:47.066 --> 14:50.500
<i>She doesn't have a husband, or parents.</i>

14:51.100 --> 14:54.433
<i>She manages everything...</i>
<i>her work, her home, her kids.</i>

14:55.266 --> 14:57.600
<i>I simply cannot leave this person.</i>

14:59.433 --> 15:02.900
My health is no good, I buried my son,
he had caused me anguish for two years.

15:03.300 --> 15:05.733
And, how should I put it...

15:07.033 --> 15:12.833
I have had a Mayak
related illness since birth.

15:13.533 --> 15:14.766
I have no health left.

15:15.500 --> 15:17.166
<i>She has helped me</i>

15:17.700 --> 15:21.566
<i>and now I can't refuse her,</i>
<i>I am helping her.</i>

15:30.100 --> 15:32.633
<i>Ozersk has been</i>
<i>a closed city since day one.</i>

15:33.866 --> 15:35.900
<i>Originally the Soviet Union</i>

15:36.033 --> 15:41.266
<i>was looking for a site</i>
<i>to produce plutonium for weapons.</i>

15:42.500 --> 15:45.900
<i>Such a site was found,</i>
<i>a spot in the woods.</i>

15:50.566 --> 15:57.066
<i>I remember, we were in school.</i>
<i>It was 1990 or 1989.</i>

15:57.600 --> 16:00.566
<i>We were getting ready for a trip.</i>

16:00.933 --> 16:02.266
<i>A man came to us,</i>

16:03.366 --> 16:04.933
dressed in a solemn suit,

16:05.433 --> 16:08.100
and warned us,

16:08.200 --> 16:09.666
"You guys are not from Ozersk.

16:10.100 --> 16:11.900
You are from Chelyabinsk.

16:12.033 --> 16:14.300
You live on Lenin Street.

16:15.566 --> 16:18.666
Because there are enemies everywhere,
and they aren't sleeping.

16:19.100 --> 16:21.033
Blabbermouths help the enemy."

16:27.866 --> 16:30.300
<i>The forbidden quality of our town</i>

16:30.366 --> 16:35.033
<i>has made people beware of strangers.</i>

16:35.533 --> 16:37.266
I remember an episode

16:37.500 --> 16:41.833
when my father went to a resort.

16:41.933 --> 16:43.600
A fellow train passenger asked him...

16:46.100 --> 16:48.233
<i>for a long time...</i>

16:48.500 --> 16:50.200
<i>about his city, the life, etc...</i>

16:50.733 --> 16:54.033
<i>Father tried to get rid of him</i>
<i>by saying he was born in Chelyabinsk.</i>

16:54.400 --> 16:57.566
That he lived on Lenin Street, and so on.

16:58.900 --> 17:01.366
<i>At the next stop, before leaving,</i>
<i>the passenger said to him,</i>

17:01.433 --> 17:05.700
<i>"Good for you. You haven't</i>
<i>disclosed anything about our city.</i>

17:09.233 --> 17:12.400
Because our town
does not accept traitors."

18:24.433 --> 18:27.566
<i>Even though Mayak</i>

18:27.633 --> 18:31.866
<i>is just a factory in Ozersk,</i>

18:32.933 --> 18:36.133
<i>historically, Mayak has always been</i>
<i>more important than the city.</i>

18:48.233 --> 18:51.200
<i>It was on July 5, 1947.</i>

18:52.233 --> 18:54.566
<i>I was met at the Kyshtym station.</i>

18:54.800 --> 18:57.733
<i>It was 11 o'clock in the evening.</i>

18:58.733 --> 19:00.300
They drove me...

19:01.533 --> 19:03.700
in an unknown direction.

19:03.800 --> 19:05.800
They didn't tell me
where I was being taken.

19:05.900 --> 19:07.600
I thought it would be a factory.

19:07.666 --> 19:11.833
in Kyshtym. I realized...

19:13.100 --> 19:15.600
there were no enterprises there

19:15.666 --> 19:18.966
that would fit my specialization.

19:21.633 --> 19:24.600
<i>I began to worry.</i>

19:24.666 --> 19:27.133
<i>Especially when we passed</i>
<i>through the center of the town.</i>

19:27.266 --> 19:30.233
<i>Then we went up the hill to the church...</i>

19:31.366 --> 19:33.800
<i>and then the woods began.</i>

19:33.900 --> 19:37.633
<i>There was nothing to see.</i>
<i>This is when I really began to worry.</i>

19:38.633 --> 19:41.733
<i>I had a sinking feeling.</i>

19:43.066 --> 19:45.400
Had I been arrested for something?

19:55.400 --> 19:57.900
<i>My mother came here at the age of eight,</i>

19:58.466 --> 20:03.066
<i>with my grandmother</i>
<i>who was a chemical engineer.</i>

20:03.900 --> 20:05.600
You were named after your grandmother?

20:05.700 --> 20:08.033
Yes, my mother named me
in honor of my grandmother.

20:08.100 --> 20:09.566
Whose mother was she?

20:13.566 --> 20:16.866
<i>Mother told me it was</i>
<i>a very long train journey.</i>

20:16.933 --> 20:19.133
<i>People were telling</i>
<i>all kinds of tall stories.</i>

20:19.533 --> 20:22.000
<i>That it was a subterranean city,</i>
<i>they would live underground.</i>

20:22.066 --> 20:23.500
<i>Nobody knew anything.</i>

20:30.500 --> 20:32.366
<i>To build the factory,</i>

20:32.433 --> 20:35.800
<i>they used forced labor</i>
<i>from the prison camps</i>

20:36.300 --> 20:38.433
<i>as construction workers.</i>

20:44.100 --> 20:48.933
<i>They also brought in elite physicists</i>
<i>from all over the country.</i>

20:49.733 --> 20:52.733
<i>Nuclear physics was only just being born.</i>

20:52.800 --> 20:55.333
<i>It was for the best and most intelligent.</i>

21:02.633 --> 21:04.900
Mother told me Grandmother was working

21:04.966 --> 21:08.233
<i>with Kurchatov to produce plutonium.</i>

21:08.566 --> 21:10.766
<i>At that time,</i>

21:10.833 --> 21:13.866
<i>they were scooping it up with spoons.</i>

21:14.366 --> 21:15.866
<i>As she recollected.</i>

21:22.433 --> 21:25.166
<i>People worked with plutonium</i>
<i>with bare hands.</i>

21:25.266 --> 21:27.666
<i>Many died, so they had to bring in</i>
<i>more and more people.</i>

21:28.133 --> 21:30.966
<i>Families were created...</i>

21:33.866 --> 21:35.566
<i>children born.</i>

21:35.766 --> 21:38.733
<i>This is how the town became a real town.</i>

21:55.033 --> 21:59.000
<i>Everything was heavily controlled</i>
<i>by Stalin's secret police.</i>

22:09.733 --> 22:13.400
<i>If someone refused to work, they'd be</i>
<i>taken to a prison camp and executed,</i>

22:14.033 --> 22:16.100
<i>because they were introduced</i>
<i>to state secrets.</i>

22:19.000 --> 22:20.700
<i>They had no choice.</i>

22:24.800 --> 22:26.966
We got used to the fact that, like pawns,

22:27.400 --> 22:30.266
we were moved from one place to another.

22:30.500 --> 22:35.066
We accepted it as a natural process...

22:35.600 --> 22:38.000
of socialist construction.

22:38.800 --> 22:40.066
<i>Though, of course,</i>

22:40.200 --> 22:42.133
<i>the situation here was,</i>

22:43.033 --> 22:44.933
<i>I would say, like a prison camp.</i>

22:46.100 --> 22:48.100
When did they allow people

22:48.200 --> 22:50.266
to go outside the city?

22:50.700 --> 22:52.200
I don't remember exactly,

22:52.266 --> 22:54.033
but, I think, after eight years.

22:58.600 --> 23:00.333
<i>My mom told me</i>

23:00.433 --> 23:03.366
<i>people who were relocated to Ozersk</i>

23:03.466 --> 23:05.700
<i>were considered missing by relatives.</i>

23:09.600 --> 23:10.566
EMPLOYMENT RECORD BOOK

23:10.633 --> 23:12.400
Of course, there was a terrible secrecy.

23:12.700 --> 23:14.700
They weren't allowed to leave town,

23:14.800 --> 23:16.533
weren't allowed to write letters.

23:16.600 --> 23:19.300
It was as if they disappeared
into oblivion.

23:41.733 --> 23:44.866
<i>People tortured by the war, famine,</i>
<i>prison camps</i>

23:45.000 --> 23:47.066
<i>were brought to a place</i>

23:47.133 --> 23:48.666
<i>that felt like paradise.</i>

23:53.533 --> 23:55.333
<i>Suddenly there's food,</i>

23:55.433 --> 23:58.100
<i>social life and entertainment.</i>

24:04.900 --> 24:09.533
<i>Their silence was payment to the state</i>

24:09.600 --> 24:10.866
<i>for a better life.</i>

24:17.433 --> 24:18.900
<i>They created their own ideology,</i>

24:18.966 --> 24:22.033
<i>"We're the saviors of the world,</i>
<i>creators of the nuclear shield."</i>

24:23.300 --> 24:26.266
<i>This ideology is what keeps them</i>
<i>running to this day.</i>

24:33.933 --> 24:37.066
<i>We lived like well-fed animals in a zoo.</i>

24:37.533 --> 24:39.766
<i>We were provided everything.</i>

24:39.833 --> 24:42.533
<i>I never wondered...</i>

24:42.866 --> 24:44.766
<i>why it was like that</i>

24:44.933 --> 24:47.433
<i>and nobody explained to me</i>

24:47.800 --> 24:49.666
<i>why we were so lucky to live</i>
<i>such happy lives.</i>

24:51.600 --> 24:54.400
We had plenty of kielbasa, food,

24:54.566 --> 24:57.000
sports clubs for kids, everything.

24:57.766 --> 24:58.866
Beautiful!

25:13.800 --> 25:15.366
<i>My father made</i>

25:15.800 --> 25:18.700
<i>enough money to give</i>
<i>the family everything.</i>

25:18.833 --> 25:20.600
<i>He could afford to give me</i>

25:21.033 --> 25:24.300
a ruble each day for food.

25:24.433 --> 25:26.733
We had stacks of chocolate stored at home.

25:27.200 --> 25:28.766
You bet.

25:28.833 --> 25:30.666
That is why they called us

25:30.733 --> 25:32.633
"Chocolate Kids."

25:40.800 --> 25:42.833
<i>I didn't tell my family...</i>

25:43.366 --> 25:46.433
where I was working, or what I was doing.

25:47.266 --> 25:49.033
I always told my daughter that

25:49.466 --> 25:51.633
I was working at a chocolate factory.

25:52.100 --> 25:55.933
So I always had to buy good chocolates...

25:56.766 --> 25:58.400
to bring her.

26:04.166 --> 26:07.200
<i>Let me tell you about</i>

26:07.500 --> 26:11.033
<i>the resentment outsiders have,</i>
<i>calling us the "Chocolate People."</i>

26:11.600 --> 26:16.400
<i>How privileged we are and so on.</i>

26:17.033 --> 26:19.366
I can say that in our ranks,

26:19.633 --> 26:24.166
they were getting good money and still do.

26:25.466 --> 26:27.466
<i>We are used to it and this is how</i>
<i>we want to live.</i>

26:28.666 --> 26:30.733
<i>The majority of people want it this way,</i>

26:30.800 --> 26:32.600
<i>and I want it too.</i>

26:50.133 --> 26:52.700
<i>Ozersk is a big city.</i>

26:55.466 --> 26:58.333
<i>The friends of my parents</i>
<i>who lived in the city of Ozersk</i>

26:58.666 --> 27:01.866
<i>told us that their life was different.</i>

27:03.666 --> 27:05.866
<i>And I can think of one episode</i>

27:06.066 --> 27:08.833
<i>when I was seven,</i>
<i>I was a first-grader at school.</i>

27:09.700 --> 27:12.000
They came to visit us,
our friends from Ozersk,

27:12.366 --> 27:15.366
and they brought me a present.

27:15.600 --> 27:17.300
It was a bunch of bananas.

27:18.533 --> 27:21.366
For someone who grew up as a kid,
in the Soviet times,

27:21.433 --> 27:22.533
in the city of Chelyabinsk,

27:23.000 --> 27:25.033
a bunch of bananas was like...

27:26.300 --> 27:28.666
a part of a fairy tale.

27:28.766 --> 27:30.666
It was absolutely out of this world.

27:35.833 --> 27:38.266
<i>When I traveled outside our town,</i>

27:38.800 --> 27:40.866
<i>I was shocked they had nothing</i>
<i>in their shops.</i>

27:41.500 --> 27:44.666
They had no bread,

27:45.033 --> 27:47.633
no sausage, no milk.

27:48.300 --> 27:51.833
They had empty shelves.

27:54.866 --> 27:57.233
<i>These people who lived</i>
<i>in the city of Ozersk,</i>

27:57.700 --> 28:00.966
<i>they had things like caviar</i>

28:01.266 --> 28:02.700
<i>and condensed milk,</i>

28:02.800 --> 28:05.033
<i>which was really something rare</i>

28:05.100 --> 28:10.566
and something that every kid
in the Soviet Union dreamed about.

28:19.266 --> 28:22.033
<i>You need to understand what</i>
<i>the Soviet Union was like back then.</i>

28:24.033 --> 28:28.266
<i>It was prestigious for those people</i>
<i>to be here.</i>

28:29.666 --> 28:32.600
<i>They didn't feel restricted.</i>

28:32.666 --> 28:35.033
<i>They had the best they'd need.</i>

28:36.866 --> 28:39.600
<i>It was prestigious. They had the best.</i>

28:39.733 --> 28:42.533
<i>Besides, scientists are obsessed</i>
<i>with what they do...</i>

28:43.633 --> 28:45.766
<i>splitting atoms. If they're happy</i>

28:45.833 --> 28:48.966
<i>with how the atoms split, they won't</i>
<i>notice anything else around them.</i>

29:02.033 --> 29:03.866
<i>I can tell you an interesting story.</i>

29:04.866 --> 29:06.466
<i>Not a story, a fact.</i>

29:08.266 --> 29:10.400
Once there was a spill of powder...

29:11.766 --> 29:16.733
the radioactive kind of powder.

29:19.433 --> 29:23.000
<i>And my father, following party rules,</i>

29:23.900 --> 29:27.666
<i>bent over and with no tools, nothing,</i>
<i>collected the powder with his hands.</i>

29:29.200 --> 29:31.200
My father died...

29:31.800 --> 29:33.633
of lung cancer at the age of 55.

29:34.600 --> 29:37.666
I think one of the factors
that contributed to it

29:37.800 --> 29:42.800
was that he inhaled that powder.

30:04.866 --> 30:06.166
<i>My family moved</i>

30:06.300 --> 30:10.866
<i>to City 40, now Ozersk.</i>

30:12.400 --> 30:15.200
<i>There were many deaths.</i>

30:16.233 --> 30:17.900
<i>We didn't know</i>

30:17.966 --> 30:20.566
<i>the cause then and had not established</i>
<i>the connection.</i>

30:20.800 --> 30:24.633
<i>But mostly people were dying</i>
<i>of carcinogenic diseases.</i>

30:26.866 --> 30:29.766
Of course, we did not suspect

30:30.266 --> 30:32.733
that the town at that time...

30:35.666 --> 30:37.466
was already...

30:38.500 --> 30:40.366
unfit for humans.

30:41.300 --> 30:44.200
<i>Several of my young cousins</i>

30:44.633 --> 30:46.933
<i>died...</i>

30:47.533 --> 30:51.200
<i>between the ages of 18-38.</i>

31:12.800 --> 31:14.200
<i>Such were the stories.</i>

31:14.266 --> 31:17.800
<i>In a way, it was a form of heroism.</i>

31:19.333 --> 31:22.900
This is one of those tragic cases

31:23.500 --> 31:27.533
when people "burned" with enthusiasm.

31:29.300 --> 31:31.233
<i>But, the work had to be done.</i>

31:31.566 --> 31:32.566
SHERSHNEV ANTON

31:36.533 --> 31:37.566
VELIKANOV VLADIMIR

31:46.466 --> 31:53.200
Absorbed in the Cold War...

31:54.466 --> 31:58.133
<i>those working on their main task</i>

31:58.233 --> 32:00.466
<i>of creating a nuclear shield...</i>

32:01.033 --> 32:02.900
<i>They worked honestly,</i>

32:03.100 --> 32:05.300
<i>in good faith, selflessly,</i>

32:05.366 --> 32:09.166
<i>and were always proud</i>
<i>of belonging to this industry...</i>

32:10.300 --> 32:14.266
<i>and proud of working</i>
<i>at the first nuclear power enterprise.</i>

32:14.933 --> 32:20.200
<i>It was the demand of the time.</i>

32:21.200 --> 32:24.533
<i>It was the period of the Cold War.</i>

32:25.900 --> 32:29.100
It wasn't us who instigated it.

33:28.266 --> 33:29.533
<i>I grew up in Ozersk.</i>

33:29.600 --> 33:32.700
<i>I finished school in Ozersk.</i>

33:34.700 --> 33:37.266
When I was a little kid,

33:37.366 --> 33:40.233
we had bomb shelters
in case of an emergency.

33:40.866 --> 33:43.200
One bomb shelter
for every few residential buildings.

33:55.666 --> 33:59.333
<i>At school, starting from first grade,</i>

33:59.466 --> 34:04.300
<i>they taught us how to use the shelters.</i>

34:27.666 --> 34:30.933
<i>As they developed nuclear weapons...</i>

34:32.766 --> 34:37.233
<i>the danger of a small-scale nuclear war</i>

34:37.333 --> 34:41.400
or accidental explosion became real,

34:41.466 --> 34:45.333
and as nuclear plants developed,

34:45.433 --> 34:47.833
a power plant accident was also possible.

34:51.500 --> 34:56.733
<i>I got a job with an experimental</i>
<i>scientific research station here.</i>

35:01.633 --> 35:04.100
<i>It was a secret institute</i>

35:04.166 --> 35:07.233
<i>to study the impact of radiation</i>

35:07.400 --> 35:10.166
<i>on health and the environment.</i>

35:11.433 --> 35:15.666
For that year I was head
of the "Chernobyl Union" in Ozersk.

35:26.033 --> 35:27.466
To the right...

35:27.766 --> 35:32.033
is central block number four.

35:34.200 --> 35:36.066
Higher!

35:36.133 --> 35:38.233
Wow, hold on that spot.

35:40.100 --> 35:42.900
Hold where the smoke is!

35:46.966 --> 35:50.900
<i>An accident has occurred</i>
<i>at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant.</i>

35:52.200 --> 35:55.166
Steps are being taken
to deal with the situation,

35:55.466 --> 35:57.600
and aid is being given to those affected.

36:10.966 --> 36:13.300
<i>My research, suddenly...</i>

36:13.766 --> 36:19.000
<i>became relevant, in the wake</i>
<i>of the Chernobyl disaster,</i>

36:19.200 --> 36:21.200
when a large population

36:21.266 --> 36:24.400
were living and farming

36:24.633 --> 36:26.300
in a contaminated territory.

36:26.800 --> 36:30.500
<i>This expertise would be necessary</i>

36:30.700 --> 36:33.200
<i>in case of a local nuclear war.</i>

36:33.333 --> 36:36.733
<i>People need to eat,</i>
<i>they live in a radioactive zone.</i>

36:36.866 --> 36:40.500
<i>So methods of survival have</i>
<i>to be worked out.</i>

36:45.766 --> 36:48.366
<i>After that, I began working</i>

36:48.533 --> 36:50.766
<i>in the organization "Planet of Hopes,"</i>

36:50.833 --> 36:52.933
<i>with Nadezhda Kutepova in Ozersk.</i>

37:00.600 --> 37:02.633
<i>We have a lesson today.</i>

37:03.733 --> 37:05.800
Will you take him? It's Wednesday.

37:11.700 --> 37:13.233
Okay, bye.

37:16.633 --> 37:18.466
Daddy is ill.

37:19.166 --> 37:20.633
Finish your breakfast, get dressed.

37:21.800 --> 37:23.466
Daddy says he's ill.

37:31.300 --> 37:34.133
<i>Both grandfathers of Nadezhda's son,</i>

37:34.200 --> 37:36.933
<i>as well as his father,</i>

37:37.600 --> 37:41.433
<i>spent more than a decade</i>

37:41.900 --> 37:44.800
working at Mayak.

37:44.933 --> 37:48.333
As a result, the baby was born
with a weak immune system.

37:50.200 --> 37:53.300
<i>This is clearly a result</i>
<i>of long-term radiation impact.</i>

37:54.500 --> 38:00.066
His body was working in a way that
any food caused an allergy in this kid.

38:04.700 --> 38:07.666
<i>My third son had</i>

38:07.900 --> 38:09.966
<i>a very serious skin disease from birth.</i>

38:13.433 --> 38:15.233
<i>For the first two years of his life,</i>

38:15.300 --> 38:17.200
<i>he was covered with scabs</i>

38:17.300 --> 38:19.866
<i>and dermatologists</i>

38:19.933 --> 38:23.200
<i>couldn't find the cause.</i>

38:24.500 --> 38:27.100
<i>Now he's better</i>

38:27.400 --> 38:28.933
<i>and again I don't know why.</i>

38:30.700 --> 38:33.033
<i>What if my son marries a local girl</i>

38:33.133 --> 38:35.600
<i>with three generations</i>
<i>of the same genetic problems?</i>

38:36.800 --> 38:38.566
<i>What kind of grandchildren will I have?</i>

38:40.733 --> 38:42.600
<i>I will do everything possible</i>

38:42.700 --> 38:45.733
<i>to keep my kids from getting married</i>
<i>in Ozersk,</i>

38:45.833 --> 38:47.966
<i>and from having children here.</i>

39:09.733 --> 39:13.600
When I worked at the research station,

39:13.666 --> 39:15.833
a classmate was writing
her dissertation...

39:16.233 --> 39:19.266
<i>on the impact of radiation</i>

39:19.433 --> 39:25.300
<i>on future generations.</i>

39:25.666 --> 39:27.700
<i>I read her drafts</i>

39:27.800 --> 39:29.666
<i>and there was a lot of data</i>

39:29.733 --> 39:31.666
<i>on different types of diseases.</i>

39:32.700 --> 39:35.133
But when her dissertation was ready
and published as a book,

39:35.200 --> 39:38.966
all the diseases were left out
and only allergies were left in.

39:39.033 --> 39:41.866
<i>There was definitely pressure</i>
<i>against publications</i>

39:41.933 --> 39:45.266
<i>of long-term health effects</i>
<i>of radiation...</i>

39:45.866 --> 39:50.666
<i>and how radiation affects children.</i>

39:50.733 --> 39:52.966
<i>This was just not allowed.</i>

40:05.000 --> 40:06.800
<i>My mother gave me detailed instructions,</i>

40:06.866 --> 40:08.500
<i>when my baby was born...</i>

40:09.866 --> 40:11.800
<i>about the streets,</i>

40:11.900 --> 40:15.300
<i>I shouldn't go on when I took</i>
<i>the baby out for a walk.</i>

40:17.166 --> 40:20.533
<i>For example, the bus stops</i>
<i>where workers from Mayak...</i>

40:21.166 --> 40:22.566
<i>would disembark from work...</i>

40:23.200 --> 40:26.300
<i>were to be avoided at all costs to keep</i>
<i>the radioactive dust from my home.</i>

40:30.966 --> 40:32.833
<i>In the past, the town</i>

40:32.933 --> 40:35.300
<i>had strict radiological</i>
<i>and sanitary controls.</i>

40:37.166 --> 40:40.600
<i>And every street was thoroughly</i>
<i>washed on a certain day of the week.</i>

40:42.666 --> 40:44.266
Dry leaves were collected,

40:44.466 --> 40:45.466
grass was mowed,

40:45.566 --> 40:49.533
which helped cope
with small-scale aerial emissions.

40:49.800 --> 40:55.600
The town was
under constant sanitary control.

40:59.466 --> 41:02.833
<i>You know, we had strict standards.</i>

41:03.833 --> 41:06.433
<i>After getting a dose of radioactivity,</i>

41:07.100 --> 41:08.900
<i>you had to leave the place,</i>

41:09.000 --> 41:10.366
take a break,

41:10.466 --> 41:12.100
go to the smoking-room.

41:13.200 --> 41:14.533
<i>You weren't sent home because</i>

41:14.600 --> 41:16.533
<i>transportation worked only</i>
<i>at a particular time.</i>

41:16.600 --> 41:18.833
<i>So you went to do something else...</i>

41:19.933 --> 41:22.766
<i>after working in the so-called</i>

41:22.933 --> 41:24.833
<i>"dirty" place.</i>

41:27.233 --> 41:29.200
The only "safety valve" they had

41:29.600 --> 41:32.966
was to go to a beer hall and sit
with a mug of beer.

41:33.066 --> 41:36.833
Beer was considered to have
a therapeutic cleansing effect.

41:39.100 --> 41:42.200
<i>Now nobody cares anymore.</i>

41:42.300 --> 41:45.700
<i>Radiation self-control skills are lost.</i>

41:45.900 --> 41:51.433
The new authorities do not do anything.

41:51.566 --> 41:56.133
For the last five years,
I haven't seen them wash the streets,

41:56.200 --> 41:57.633
or remove grass once.

42:33.200 --> 42:35.266
<i>You go in a car and you pass</i>

42:35.333 --> 42:38.200
<i>a very spectacular chain</i>
<i>of beautiful lakes.</i>

42:39.466 --> 42:42.600
<i>Like, one lake is beautiful, the next</i>
<i>one is even more beautiful,</i>

42:42.666 --> 42:46.300
but then the local people tell you
that this lake is nicknamed...

42:46.733 --> 42:48.366
"The Lake of Death"

42:48.700 --> 42:51.533
or a "Plutonium Lake",

42:51.833 --> 42:55.733
because it is so heavily contaminated
with plutonium.

42:59.666 --> 43:01.866
NO TRESPASSING EITHER BY CAR OR ON FOOT

43:21.133 --> 43:24.300
<i>During its early years of operation,</i>

43:24.700 --> 43:27.100
<i>when the technology was new</i>

43:27.400 --> 43:29.733
<i>and experimental,</i>

43:29.866 --> 43:33.500
<i>nobody cared about what might happen</i>
<i>to the environment.</i>

43:34.600 --> 43:36.000
<i>The workers weren't concerned,</i>

43:36.066 --> 43:39.133
<i>because they were ordered</i>
<i>to build the nuclear bomb.</i>

43:39.966 --> 43:41.933
<i>They did what they were ordered to do.</i>

43:51.100 --> 43:52.966
<i>Nobody thought the waste</i>

43:53.033 --> 43:55.300
<i>would be radioactive</i>
<i>for millions of years.</i>

43:56.133 --> 43:58.333
<i>And so they just dumped...</i>

43:59.200 --> 44:05.666
<i>the by-products of chemical reactions</i>
<i>into the river.</i>

44:11.700 --> 44:17.300
<i>In the early 90s, when the information</i>
<i>about pollution and accidents appeared,</i>

44:19.700 --> 44:22.200
<i>I thought, like a typical resident</i>
<i>of closed city,</i>

44:23.033 --> 44:26.533
<i>everybody wants to close our good factory,</i>

44:26.633 --> 44:29.566
<i>and we're the good people</i>
<i>who made the atomic bomb.</i>

44:31.200 --> 44:36.600
<i>Later, when I met</i>
<i>ecologists from the green movement,</i>

44:36.666 --> 44:39.433
<i>when I saw the documents with my own eyes,</i>

44:39.500 --> 44:43.033
<i>when I saw government officials</i>
<i>who said totally different things</i>

44:43.100 --> 44:45.533
<i>in public than what they told us...</i>

44:45.600 --> 44:47.566
<i>I realized that it was all a lie.</i>

44:52.100 --> 44:55.366
<i>The first major documented disaster</i>

44:55.466 --> 44:58.933
<i>is officially called an accident.</i>

44:59.000 --> 45:02.433
<i>But in fact it was a planned dumping</i>
<i>of highly radioactive waste</i>

45:02.566 --> 45:04.766
<i>into the River Techa.</i>

45:07.366 --> 45:10.900
<i>The second major accident happened</i>
<i>in 1957...</i>

45:12.166 --> 45:13.933
<i>when an underground container</i>

45:14.000 --> 45:16.766
<i>of liquid radioactive waste exploded.</i>

45:19.600 --> 45:22.233
<i>This is where on the site of Mayak</i>

45:22.400 --> 45:27.433
<i>on the quiet evening</i>
<i>of September 29, 1957,</i>

45:27.900 --> 45:32.033
<i>a tank of liquid nuclear waste exploded.</i>

45:33.333 --> 45:36.066
<i>The deadly radioactive cloud</i>

45:36.166 --> 45:38.566
<i>began to move in a north-east direction.</i>

45:38.633 --> 45:43.700
<i>As a result, a huge territory, 105 km long</i>
<i>and 9 km wide,</i>

45:43.766 --> 45:46.133
<i>was contaminated with radionuclides,</i>

45:46.300 --> 45:49.066
<i>Both people and animals became victims.</i>

45:49.933 --> 45:50.833
DANGER ZONE

45:50.900 --> 45:56.666
<i>23 villages had to be destroyed.</i>
<i>More than 10,000 people</i>

45:56.733 --> 45:58.666
<i>were evacuated to safe areas.</i>

46:01.433 --> 46:04.300
For how long can we stay in this place?

46:04.366 --> 46:07.066
If we calculate...

46:07.133 --> 46:13.700
using official daily norms...

46:17.900 --> 46:19.500
20 seconds.

46:34.300 --> 46:36.433
There is a radioactive river.

46:37.266 --> 46:39.666
<i>The village cattle</i>

46:39.766 --> 46:41.366
<i>comes up to the river</i>

46:41.433 --> 46:43.100
<i>and drinks its water.</i>

46:43.200 --> 46:45.033
<i>If the cattle just drank,</i>

46:45.100 --> 46:47.933
it would get much less radionuclides.

46:48.266 --> 46:50.766
But the cattle steps in the river,
mixing the sediment...

46:51.433 --> 46:52.966
with the upper level of clear water.

46:53.300 --> 46:55.533
The cattle drinks that water
and it gets into its milk.

46:56.566 --> 47:00.200
<i>People use that milk to make</i>

47:00.366 --> 47:02.566
<i>dairy products...</i>

47:03.466 --> 47:05.566
<i>and also drink it raw.</i>

47:08.000 --> 47:10.166
<i>Of course, we didn't know anything</i>
<i>about this.</i>

47:10.733 --> 47:14.166
We used to swim and fish in that river.

47:15.066 --> 47:17.066
<i>I learned later that at some point</i>

47:17.300 --> 47:20.333
<i>the International Atomic Energy Agency</i>

47:20.766 --> 47:23.800
<i>discovered strontium in the Arctic Ocean.</i>

47:24.766 --> 47:28.400
And then the investigation found out...

47:30.100 --> 47:34.400
where that strontium had come from.

47:35.066 --> 47:36.933
<i>They traced it</i>

47:37.033 --> 47:39.766
<i>all the way back to the River Techa.</i>

48:01.166 --> 48:03.633
<i>Officially, my father got 600 roentgen</i>

48:03.900 --> 48:05.933
<i>of radiation from his work.</i>

48:06.000 --> 48:06.833
DANGEROUS SITE

48:06.900 --> 48:08.100
<i>It's a very high dose.</i>

48:08.166 --> 48:12.166
<i>My mother got 400 roentgen, officially.</i>

48:13.733 --> 48:15.933
My mother died at 62.

48:16.733 --> 48:19.800
She got stomach cancer.
She underwent surgery, but died.

48:32.033 --> 48:36.500
<i>The third major accident took place</i>
<i>in 1967,</i> <i>when Lake Karachay...</i>

48:39.266 --> 48:42.333
<i>where they were dumping</i>
<i>and are still dumping radioactive waste,</i>

48:42.400 --> 48:43.733
<i>dried out</i>

48:43.966 --> 48:48.133
<i>and created a dust storm</i>
<i>that contaminated a vast territory,</i>

48:48.233 --> 48:50.666
<i>in particular, several villages</i>
<i>upon the River Techa.</i>

48:55.566 --> 48:58.233
<i>The aftermath of Mayak's activities</i>

48:58.300 --> 49:00.066
<i>is really disastrous.</i>

49:01.233 --> 49:03.700
<i>One can say that Mayak was built on dead</i>

49:03.966 --> 49:05.466
<i>and ruined human bodies.</i>

49:16.266 --> 49:17.700
You're coming back, right?

49:17.766 --> 49:19.666
Certainly. I'll just see him out.

49:20.966 --> 49:25.133
<i>Nadezhda Kutepova</i>
<i>is not afraid of going against</i>

49:25.200 --> 49:28.600
the opinion of the majority
of people around her.

49:29.600 --> 49:31.400
<i>She was the first to see</i>

49:31.500 --> 49:34.533
<i>violations of the law,</i>
<i>and human rights violations</i>

49:34.800 --> 49:36.433
<i>in the treatment of people.</i>

49:37.766 --> 49:39.833
<i>When I walk down the corridor</i>
<i>past her office,</i>

49:40.000 --> 49:41.866
<i>I see people waiting to see her.</i>

49:42.500 --> 49:44.466
<i>When I walk,</i>

49:44.533 --> 49:47.566
<i>I see people.</i>

49:47.800 --> 49:50.866
<i>People really trust her.</i>

49:53.333 --> 49:55.600
Ozersk is not included

49:55.800 --> 50:00.433
in the list of towns polluted
by the 1957 disaster.

50:01.533 --> 50:04.066
Officially, Ozersk was not affected.
Of course, that's not true

50:04.166 --> 50:06.966
and everybody knows it.

50:07.833 --> 50:11.233
The number of people the state
is ready to compensate

50:11.300 --> 50:13.600
-is increasingly narrowing down.
-And we are dying.

50:13.700 --> 50:15.866
This is their policy.

50:16.100 --> 50:19.466
Recently, we got a visit from
a State Duma member.

50:19.733 --> 50:21.600
And he said, "You are so many!"

50:21.800 --> 50:24.300
I thought the problem
had already been resolved.

50:24.400 --> 50:26.833
What does it mean,
"The problem has been resolved?

50:26.900 --> 50:28.933
That everybody has died?"

50:29.266 --> 50:33.100
Anyway, I have nothing good to tell you.

50:33.166 --> 50:34.633
Thank you.

50:42.433 --> 50:43.866
Good morning.

50:44.566 --> 50:46.966
I'll tell you the situation now,
but, unfortunately,

50:47.033 --> 50:49.333
I have nothing good to tell you.

50:49.433 --> 50:53.700
The situation with the court cases
is at a dead end.

50:54.500 --> 50:56.366
The committee is closed.

50:56.466 --> 50:58.600
From tomorrow, they will not grant
anything to anyone.

51:02.966 --> 51:05.500
<i>People from closed cities</i>

51:05.833 --> 51:09.666
<i>defend their rights in court</i>
<i>very unwillingly.</i>

51:12.900 --> 51:16.200
<i>People are still afraid,</i>

51:16.933 --> 51:19.333
<i>and they'll go...</i>

51:19.833 --> 51:22.666
<i>to court only when they're</i>
<i>in deep despair.</i>

51:27.266 --> 51:31.200
<i>Closed cities still resemble</i>
<i>the Soviet Union.</i>

51:33.766 --> 51:36.033
<i>In the Soviet Union,</i>

51:36.100 --> 51:38.566
<i>legal status of closed cities</i>
<i>was never defined.</i>

51:43.533 --> 51:47.666
<i>The Soviet Union had come a long way</i>
<i>under the leadership of Mikhail Gorbachev.</i>

51:49.800 --> 51:52.266
<i>He talked of perestroika or reform,</i>

51:52.700 --> 51:55.833
<i>and glasnost, meaning</i>
<i>greater freedom of speech.</i>

52:04.500 --> 52:06.633
<i>Mingling with the rush hour traffic,</i>

52:06.800 --> 52:10.633
<i>Red Army armored personnel carriers</i>
<i>on the streets of Moscow this morning,</i>

52:11.033 --> 52:12.766
<i>the first sign of the coup d'etat</i>

52:12.866 --> 52:15.166
<i>that removed Mikhail Gorbachev from power.</i>

52:15.666 --> 52:17.900
Long live Yeltsin!

52:21.233 --> 52:23.666
<i>In the Yeltsin times,</i>

52:23.733 --> 52:25.733
<i>around 1996,</i>

52:27.033 --> 52:29.666
<i>things started to improve...</i>

52:30.566 --> 52:32.166
and go back to normal.

52:33.333 --> 52:35.433
Order was reintroduced

52:35.500 --> 52:38.866
and it was in those Yeltsin times

52:39.733 --> 52:44.266
<i>that Russia and its closed cities</i>

52:44.533 --> 52:48.766
<i>began to restructure to get rid of</i>

52:48.966 --> 52:50.900
<i>that old Soviet dust.</i>

52:55.166 --> 52:58.766
Let us stand firmly together.

52:58.866 --> 53:02.733
The reactionary forces will not pass!

53:21.500 --> 53:23.466
<i>The closed cities got</i>

53:23.566 --> 53:25.000
<i>their legal status in 1994</i>

53:25.066 --> 53:28.300
<i>when, by governmental decree,</i>

53:28.366 --> 53:29.700
<i>they were given public names.</i>

53:29.766 --> 53:31.800
<i>Ozersk was officially named Ozersk</i>

53:32.033 --> 53:34.200
<i>and these cities were put on the map.</i>

53:40.000 --> 53:43.733
<i>But the state invented a clever way</i>

53:43.833 --> 53:45.766
<i>to keep us in legal limbo.</i>

53:47.666 --> 53:51.766
<i>We didn't think much about it,</i>

53:51.833 --> 53:53.900
<i>but in 1994...</i>

53:54.733 --> 53:56.700
<i>when our town received its legal status,</i>

53:56.866 --> 53:59.433
<i>newborns received birth certificates</i>

53:59.533 --> 54:01.266
<i>that stated Ozersk as their birthplace.</i>

54:03.033 --> 54:07.500
<i>But everybody born in Ozersk before 1994</i>

54:07.566 --> 54:12.366
<i>was officially listed</i>
<i>as born in Chelyabinsk.</i>

54:14.500 --> 54:17.500
<i>They couldn't exclude the possibility</i>

54:17.633 --> 54:19.633
<i>that a disaster</i>

54:19.700 --> 54:22.400
<i>would wipe the town off the earth.</i>

54:23.866 --> 54:27.233
<i>So they registered us in a way</i>

54:27.333 --> 54:29.966
<i>that we could be erased legally</i>
<i>if necessary.</i>

54:30.800 --> 54:33.200
<i>We asked the registry office</i>

54:33.400 --> 54:35.833
<i>in Chelyabinsk to correct our birthplace,</i>

54:36.000 --> 54:37.900
<i>but we weren't even listed</i>
<i>in their archives.</i>

54:39.833 --> 54:42.000
<i>They said, "Sorry, you were not born</i>
<i>in our region."</i>

54:47.033 --> 54:48.166
-Can I come in?
-Yes.

54:53.766 --> 54:57.766
People who registered place of birth
after 2005, they exist,

54:57.833 --> 55:04.733
but hesitate to go to court
because there are no precedents.

55:05.533 --> 55:07.733
You will make history

55:07.866 --> 55:10.833
as the first person to file a lawsuit
in this situation,

55:10.900 --> 55:12.166
and the court decision

55:12.233 --> 55:15.800
in your case will be precedent
in other decisions.

55:16.133 --> 55:18.500
So, I will be in history forever?

55:19.066 --> 55:22.166
Forever, of course.
How else is history made, if not forever?

55:23.200 --> 55:25.133
They may appeal,

55:25.233 --> 55:28.266
but the probability is 70% against it.

55:28.333 --> 55:30.300
I can't guarantee you 100%.

55:33.466 --> 55:34.833
So, we just have to wait.

55:37.600 --> 55:40.300
But, we've come a long way with you.

55:40.533 --> 55:42.300
I've been coming here for a year already.

55:42.400 --> 55:44.266
Let's hope they don't appeal.

55:45.000 --> 55:48.366
Everything seems to be happening the way
I told you.

55:49.366 --> 55:52.033
It's working.

55:52.733 --> 55:54.533
Well, well.

55:56.366 --> 55:58.433
<i>She takes cases</i>
<i>that are difficult to resolve.</i>

55:58.766 --> 56:00.933
<i>She takes to heart</i>

56:01.233 --> 56:03.100
<i>the problems of other people</i>

56:03.166 --> 56:06.866
<i>and volunteers to resolve them.</i>

56:09.633 --> 56:11.433
She's an amazing person

56:11.866 --> 56:13.366
who makes everything her business.

56:13.533 --> 56:15.633
There are only two such people,
myself and her.

56:17.033 --> 56:18.533
Take care of your health.

56:22.666 --> 56:23.966
Okay, lets go.

56:24.800 --> 56:27.333
I have to make him kiss your hand, too.

56:30.066 --> 56:33.100
I remember the wave of accusations,

56:33.166 --> 56:35.433
after a case was opened against her.

56:37.700 --> 56:41.566
<i>That she did things wrongly,</i>

56:42.966 --> 56:45.100
<i>that she went against the opinion</i>

56:45.200 --> 56:47.166
<i>of the Ministry of Health,</i>

56:47.366 --> 56:51.133
<i>against existing norms.</i>

56:51.666 --> 56:53.333
That she was taking cases

56:53.833 --> 56:57.066
above and beyond her abilities.

56:57.333 --> 56:58.933
But she did start to resolve them.

57:01.233 --> 57:03.133
<i>Ever since I began</i>

57:03.200 --> 57:07.066
<i>my human rights activities</i>

57:07.266 --> 57:10.366
<i>and began helping people</i>
<i>who live in the contaminated areas,</i>

57:10.633 --> 57:13.466
<i>the authorities have been</i>

57:13.866 --> 57:17.500
<i>persecuting me and my organization.</i>

57:18.500 --> 57:22.200
<i>It was two years ago that the authorities</i>

57:22.266 --> 57:25.133
<i>started putting pressure</i>
<i>on us at every step.</i>

57:27.733 --> 57:30.366
<i>-Glue.</i>
<i>-We'll glue now. Sit.</i>

57:32.400 --> 57:33.700
Now we'll do cut outs.

57:42.800 --> 57:46.233
<i>There were constant checks</i>
<i>on our organization.</i>

57:46.333 --> 57:51.133
<i>Year after year, they do tax inspections</i>
<i>on us,</i>

57:51.500 --> 57:54.766
<i>just now they did a tax inspection.</i>

57:56.166 --> 58:00.666
<i>The authorities constantly visit my home</i>

58:00.833 --> 58:04.466
<i>and even visit my child in kindergarten.</i>

58:17.400 --> 58:21.733
<i>Even our landlord asked</i>

58:21.800 --> 58:23.800
<i>to terminate our lease.</i>

58:24.366 --> 58:27.433
<i>He said, "I'm not against what you're</i>
<i>doing, and I would like you to stay."</i>

58:27.633 --> 58:30.433
<i>"But I got a phone call asking me</i>
<i>to kick you out."</i>

58:40.066 --> 58:41.666
<i>When someone goes public,</i>

58:41.766 --> 58:44.233
<i>it's much easier to declare him</i>
<i>an enemy and fight him,</i>

58:44.933 --> 58:47.333
<i>instead of trying to change something</i>
<i>in the system.</i>

58:49.166 --> 58:52.200
-I made it first.
-Yes, I heard that.

59:17.700 --> 59:21.833
<i>Today, Mayak produces isotopes</i>

59:21.933 --> 59:24.600
<i>for the medical and space industries.</i>

59:25.100 --> 59:26.533
<i>But they're still doing something</i>

59:26.600 --> 59:29.200
<i>for the country's defense</i>
<i>and that's state secret.</i>

59:37.533 --> 59:41.400
<i>There are 14,000 people working at Mayak.</i>

59:41.833 --> 59:45.766
<i>If we multiply that by three,</i>

59:46.000 --> 59:49.833
counting a wife and a grown-up child,

59:50.000 --> 59:54.033
that's 42,000 people
related to the facilities.

59:54.600 --> 59:56.533
<i>Plus 28,000 pensioners.</i>

59:56.866 --> 59:59.866
<i>So, there are 60,000 people</i>

01:00:00.100 --> 01:00:03.166
<i>who are connected with Mayak</i>
<i>and informed about its activities.</i>

01:00:05.066 --> 01:00:10.400
<i>Most of those who work at Mayak,</i>

01:00:10.633 --> 01:00:14.533
<i>at weapons production,</i>
<i>they work with state secrets.</i>

01:00:15.033 --> 01:00:18.133
<i>Each of them has</i>

01:00:18.366 --> 01:00:20.866
<i>an FSB officer</i>

01:00:21.033 --> 01:00:22.866
<i>who records their private lives.</i>

01:00:22.933 --> 01:00:25.100
<i>Where they go, who they meet,</i>

01:00:25.166 --> 01:00:28.833
<i>how much money they spend, what they buy.</i>
<i>They check everything.</i>

01:00:33.500 --> 01:00:36.300
<i>That means that in fact</i>
<i>it's only about thought control.</i>

01:00:36.366 --> 01:00:39.566
<i>The core of their job is</i>
<i>to silence dissidents.</i>

01:00:40.666 --> 01:00:44.566
<i>To silence dissidents,</i>

01:00:44.766 --> 01:00:47.200
<i>not to care about efficient security.</i>

01:01:06.633 --> 01:01:13.133
<i>We have the FSM unit at Mayak.</i>

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:15.533
Our troops...

01:01:16.766 --> 01:01:18.600
special troops...

01:01:18.700 --> 01:01:23.333
guard the sealed perimeter.

01:01:24.033 --> 01:01:26.833
<i>And this setup</i>

01:01:26.900 --> 01:01:31.566
<i>is checked annually</i>
<i>by designated inspections</i>

01:01:31.966 --> 01:01:35.266
<i>that make sure everything is secure</i>
<i>and kept in proper shape.</i>

01:02:17.933 --> 01:02:21.066
If, for example,

01:02:21.500 --> 01:02:24.300
you find out...

01:02:24.366 --> 01:02:26.066
that the polonium used

01:02:26.633 --> 01:02:29.600
in the Litvinenko assassination
in the U.K.

01:02:30.533 --> 01:02:33.533
came from Mayak,

01:02:34.233 --> 01:02:37.866
you can be almost 100% sure

01:02:38.066 --> 01:02:42.200
the material was...

01:02:42.900 --> 01:02:46.933
released via the security gates,

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:48.500
and it was sanctioned

01:02:48.800 --> 01:02:52.933
by the top management of Mayak. 100% sure.

01:02:56.400 --> 01:02:59.500
<i>Former Russian spy, Alexander Litvinenko</i>
<i>was killed</i>

01:02:59.566 --> 01:03:01.200
<i>by radioactive poisoning leading to</i>

01:03:01.266 --> 01:03:04.866
<i>a clouding of relations</i>
<i>between London and Moscow.</i>

01:03:05.266 --> 01:03:06.866
<i>The polonium trail across London</i>

01:03:06.933 --> 01:03:09.600
<i>implies that he was poisoned</i>
<i>by polonium 210</i>

01:03:09.666 --> 01:03:11.333
<i>that was slipped into his tea.</i>

01:03:11.700 --> 01:03:13.166
<i>Whoever killed Litvinenko</i>

01:03:13.233 --> 01:03:15.633
<i>would have expected him to die</i>
<i>in a few days.</i>

01:03:16.033 --> 01:03:18.333
<i>It was only because he died</i>
<i>three weeks later</i>

01:03:18.400 --> 01:03:21.300
<i>that the doctors had the chance</i>
<i>to discover the truth.</i>

01:03:22.400 --> 01:03:25.200
If someone comes here with a suitcase
full of cash,

01:03:25.633 --> 01:03:29.700
they will pick up the phone and ask,

01:03:29.900 --> 01:03:31.300
"Mr. Putin, can we do this?"

01:03:31.466 --> 01:03:34.233
Money would not matter in it.

01:03:34.900 --> 01:03:37.566
This is not measured in money anymore.

01:04:07.100 --> 01:04:08.966
<i>People need to know what's being done,</i>

01:04:09.066 --> 01:04:13.033
<i>what risks are involved.</i>

01:04:13.800 --> 01:04:17.933
After the Mayak disaster of 1957

01:04:18.100 --> 01:04:20.866
and the Chernobyl disaster of 1986,

01:04:21.500 --> 01:04:23.533
<i>Russians have learned</i>
<i>not to trust the state.</i>

01:04:26.033 --> 01:04:28.533
In some cases society is right,

01:04:28.633 --> 01:04:32.800
because once you lie
nobody will believe you.

01:04:46.166 --> 01:04:48.866
<i>Historical memories are</i>
<i>a very important component</i>

01:04:48.933 --> 01:04:51.966
of our culture, our history,

01:04:52.066 --> 01:04:57.033
our lives. And of course, we should
also consider the future.

01:05:00.900 --> 01:05:02.166
<i>I'd like to remind you,</i>

01:05:02.233 --> 01:05:06.400
<i>Russia is one of the biggest</i>
<i>nuclear powers.</i>

01:05:06.466 --> 01:05:08.500
<i>This is not just words, this is real,</i>

01:05:08.600 --> 01:05:11.766
<i>and we are strengthening our forces</i>
<i>of nuclear containment.</i>

01:05:11.833 --> 01:05:15.300
<i>They are more compact now,</i>

01:05:15.366 --> 01:05:17.566
<i>but they're also more efficient.</i>

01:05:21.366 --> 01:05:25.700
<i>They're more modern.</i>

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.533
<i>They have modern weaponry.</i>

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:32.033
<i>This is not to threaten anybody.</i>

01:05:32.133 --> 01:05:35.466
<i>This is just for us to feel protected.</i>

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.566
We do not want it,
and we aren't going to do it.

01:05:38.833 --> 01:05:41.900
Of course, we should always be ready
to repel any aggression,

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:46.000
any attack on Russia,
regardless of the situation

01:05:46.500 --> 01:05:49.200
our partner nations are in.

01:05:49.266 --> 01:05:51.666
They should always realize

01:05:51.766 --> 01:05:53.966
they would be better off
not messing with us.

01:06:12.133 --> 01:06:14.133
I love my motherland,

01:06:14.200 --> 01:06:15.900
this small piece of land which is my home.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:20.966
I hate this government that exists
on my land.

01:06:22.033 --> 01:06:25.466
<i>I love these trees, these mushrooms,</i>

01:06:25.900 --> 01:06:28.700
<i>this water, the fish in it.</i>

01:06:29.133 --> 01:06:31.233
But I can't be at peace with this regime.

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:35.233
I can't live with this.

01:06:37.666 --> 01:06:39.866
<i>It is difficult for me to imagine</i>

01:06:39.966 --> 01:06:43.033
<i>that the state, the authorities,</i>

01:06:43.766 --> 01:06:46.766
still allow people to live in that area.

01:06:46.833 --> 01:06:49.200
Because, I mean, this...

01:06:50.400 --> 01:06:52.133
This is really a nightmare.

01:06:52.733 --> 01:06:56.166
And I really feel about...

01:07:07.533 --> 01:07:10.633
<i>I think there is a certain "blindness"</i>
<i>in our people.</i>

01:07:11.966 --> 01:07:14.400
<i>A certain pride...</i>

01:07:15.500 --> 01:07:16.833
<i>not unexplainable.</i>

01:07:19.333 --> 01:07:23.266
"We are special,
we are from a closed city..."

01:07:23.633 --> 01:07:25.633
In fact, they are ordinary people,

01:07:26.266 --> 01:07:27.933
nothing special.

01:07:29.833 --> 01:07:32.266
<i>In reality, it's difficult to leave</i>

01:07:32.433 --> 01:07:34.100
<i>and I faced that myself.</i>

01:07:37.733 --> 01:07:40.766
<i>If you account for the opinions</i>
<i>of many people</i>

01:07:40.833 --> 01:07:43.333
<i>and, as a journalist, I speak with many,</i>

01:07:43.933 --> 01:07:47.233
people always want to have stability.

01:07:47.333 --> 01:07:50.933
"It may be for the better,
it may be for the worse,

01:07:51.033 --> 01:07:53.700
but for now just leave us alone, please.

01:07:54.366 --> 01:07:55.733
Let me live quietly."

01:07:59.500 --> 01:08:03.033
<i>I always had an inner desire</i>

01:08:03.100 --> 01:08:04.600
<i>to break free</i>

01:08:04.700 --> 01:08:05.800
<i>from this confinement.</i>

01:08:06.333 --> 01:08:08.333
Unfortunately, as fate would have it,

01:08:08.400 --> 01:08:10.533
this town won't let me go.

01:08:10.633 --> 01:08:13.766
No matter how many times I try to leave,
seemingly forever,

01:08:14.033 --> 01:08:16.366
fate keeps bringing me back.

01:08:22.265 --> 01:08:25.933
<i>Of course, I worry about my safety,</i>

01:08:26.100 --> 01:08:29.600
<i>but I don't know what to do about that.</i>

01:08:31.166 --> 01:08:34.566
<i>I want to go on helping the people</i>

01:08:34.765 --> 01:08:38.366
<i>who everybody else has turned away.</i>

01:08:40.433 --> 01:08:45.133
<i>We will work behind enemy lines,</i>
<i>like our partisans did in World War II.</i>
