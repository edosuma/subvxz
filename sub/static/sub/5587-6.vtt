ADULT ADAM: <i> Back in the day,</i>
<i> trick-or-treating was my jam.</i>

00:02.937 --> 00:06.038
<i> I'd spend months making</i>
<i> the most epic</i>
<i> Halloween costumes</i>

00:06.040 --> 00:07.272
<i> the '80s had ever seen.</i>

00:07.274 --> 00:10.075
<i> I was a master</i>

00:10.077 --> 00:12.444
<i> My costumes</i>
<i> were not only awesome,</i>

00:12.446 --> 00:14.013

I'm the coolest E.T.

00:21.722 --> 00:22.921
Look out, Jenkintown.

00:22.923 --> 00:24.790
Here comes a Ghostbuster!

00:24.792 --> 00:25.624
<i> It was embarrassing.</i>

00:25.626 --> 00:28.827
And I'm his
Stay Puft Marshmallow

00:28.829 --> 00:30.396
<i> And every year, it got worse.</i>

00:30.398 --> 00:33.198
Freeze, creep.
I'm Robocop.

00:33.200 --> 00:39.571
And I'm ED-209,
Omnicorp's first foray
into robotic policing.

00:39.573 --> 00:40.439
I'm Indy!

00:40.441 --> 00:42.074

00:42.076 --> 00:42.641
And I'm Mork.

00:42.643 --> 00:45.511
I thought you said
you were going as Mindy.

00:45.513 --> 00:46.812
Why would I be going
as Mindy?

00:46.814 --> 00:50.616
Well, I guess
we're Mork and Indy.

I want you
to have this.

01:00.394 --> 01:02.261
Oh, my God.

01:02.263 --> 01:03.328
Our promise ring.

01:03.330 --> 01:04.329
I know you gave it back
when you moved,

01:04.331 --> 01:07.833

we've proved nothing
can stand between us.

01:20.081 --> 01:23.615
Well, this Predator
kisses instead of kills.

You're ruining
the property.

Or is Preda-mom
making it better?

01:27.221 --> 01:29.755
I told you, this year,
I'm doing a couples costume

01:29.757 --> 01:32.991
with the person
I'm actually in a couple with.

01:32.993 --> 01:34.593
Hi, Mrs. Goldberg.

01:34.595 --> 01:35.394
Dana. Look.

01:35.396 --> 01:39.264
Your <i> Alien</i> movie has
nothing to do with my costume,

01:39.266 --> 01:41.333
at least not that I know of.

01:41.335 --> 01:42.034
(CHUCKLING) God.

<i> Alien versus Predator?</i>

01:48.542 --> 01:50.576
Now, when did these two
get to know each other?

01:50.578 --> 01:53.078
You said our costume
was Mom-proof.

01:53.080 --> 01:54.346
I forgot about
the crossover.

01:54.348 --> 01:56.882
This is a very happy
coincidence.

01:56.884 --> 01:57.749
We're gonna make
quite the trio.

01:57.751 --> 02:01.520
No. You are not
following us around
tonight in that costume.

02:01.522 --> 02:03.789
You want me to follow you
around without a costume?

02:03.791 --> 02:06.291
Come on.
I'm gonna look crazy.

02:06.293 --> 02:09.428
I don't need my mom's help
to go trick-or-treating.

02:09.430 --> 02:11.029
I'm going with Dana.

02:11.031 --> 02:12.064
Not you.

02:12.066 --> 02:13.899
Oh. Okay.

02:13.901 --> 02:17.136
I guess I'll just go.

02:59.480 --> 03:02.347
Okay, here's our path
through Jenkintown.

03:02.349 --> 03:03.916
First, we hit
Tom McFadden's kegger,

03:03.918 --> 03:06.818
then we head north
and hit these three parties.

03:06.820 --> 03:08.954
Ooh, are you planning
a candy route?

03:08.956 --> 03:10.322
We should combine our data.

May I?
You may.

Ow!

03:13.260 --> 03:13.825
What was that for?

03:13.827 --> 03:17.129
Dude! Your girlfriend
came across the ocean
to be with you.

03:17.131 --> 03:18.263
Dana lives in Seattle.

03:18.265 --> 03:19.865
Exactly.
Do you really think

03:19.867 --> 03:21.833
she wants to spend
her one night in America

03:21.835 --> 03:23.735
collecting candy
like a little toddler?

03:23.737 --> 03:25.404
But that's what
we always do.

03:25.406 --> 03:27.439
It's what you did.
You're adults now.

03:27.441 --> 03:31.109
Just listen to your deep,
yet still high weird voice.

03:31.111 --> 03:32.010
Hurtful, but continue.

03:32.012 --> 03:35.013
It's Halloween, dude,
a night for romance.

03:35.015 --> 03:37.216
This holiday's all about
girls getting scared

03:37.218 --> 03:40.152
and running to a big,
strong man for protection.

03:40.154 --> 03:41.253
It's evolution.

03:41.255 --> 03:42.955
Idiot punch.
Ow.

03:42.957 --> 03:43.655
But he's got a point.

03:43.657 --> 03:46.091
We do pretend to be scared
to make it easy for boys

03:46.093 --> 03:47.726
because we feel bad
for them.

03:47.728 --> 03:48.293
Wow. Okay.

03:48.295 --> 03:50.495
So I should take her
someplace scary.

03:50.497 --> 03:51.897
Like JCPenney?

03:51.899 --> 03:52.631
What?
What?

03:52.633 --> 03:54.866
They put a bunch
of spider webs up in
their mattress display.

03:54.868 --> 03:57.502
You know they're fake,
but they make you think,

03:57.504 --> 04:00.005
"What if my bed
had spiders?"

04:00.007 --> 04:00.539
Oh, my God, no.

There's a frat at Villanova

haunted house.

04:03.677 --> 04:04.276
Take her there.

to pay money
to get tortured

04:07.348 --> 04:08.647

It's just a stupid
haunted house.

04:11.485 --> 04:12.317
You'll be fine.

04:12.319 --> 04:14.686
Hey.
Ready to head out?

04:14.688 --> 04:16.221
Uh, yeah. Question.

04:16.223 --> 04:18.090
What would you rather
do tonight...

04:18.092 --> 04:19.925

04:23.797 --> 04:26.331
What?
Free candy?
(CHUCKLES)

04:26.333 --> 04:29.201
Or go to a lame haunted
house, super-boring?

04:29.203 --> 04:31.136
A haunted house
does sound cool,

04:31.138 --> 04:33.538
although, I might need
you to protect me.

04:33.540 --> 04:35.641
Told you.
Haunted house it is.

04:35.643 --> 04:38.310
Hopefully they have
friendly ghosts like Casper.

04:38.312 --> 04:40.846

04:53.360 --> 04:55.227
Okay.
Don't you judge me.

04:55.229 --> 04:56.328
I'm just creating
a visual aid

04:56.330 --> 05:01.099
to show Adam the dangers of
getting candy from strangers
without his mother.

05:01.101 --> 05:04.436
See?
This used to be fun-size.

05:04.438 --> 05:06.204
Now it's terror-size.

05:06.206 --> 05:06.938
You know what's terrifying?

05:06.940 --> 05:09.308
The fact that you still
want to go trick-or-treating

05:09.310 --> 05:13.011
in matching costumes
with your almost-adult son.

05:13.013 --> 05:14.846

05:14.848 --> 05:17.049
I have to for his safety.

05:17.051 --> 05:19.985
Halloween is a night
where gangs of street toughs

05:19.987 --> 05:23.355
roam the sidewalks
looking to rough up children

05:23.357 --> 05:24.856
and take their candy.

05:28.028 --> 05:30.162
And don't even get me
started on the kidnappers.

05:30.164 --> 05:32.364
They hitch a ride
with the street toughs.

05:32.366 --> 05:33.298
So they're all carpooling.

05:33.300 --> 05:34.599
Maybe they're taking
the bus.

05:34.601 --> 05:35.701
What kind of bus is this?

05:35.703 --> 05:37.703
The point is,
I don't do this for me.

05:37.705 --> 05:39.338
Trick-or-treating
is a nightmare,

05:39.340 --> 05:41.740
and I can't wait
for Adam to give it up.

05:41.742 --> 05:42.941
Hey, ma,
me and Dana decided

05:42.943 --> 05:45.577
to go to a haunted house
this year.

We'll be back by 9:00.

05:46.413 --> 05:48.246

trick-or-treating?

05:48.248 --> 05:50.549

to prove a point

05:50.551 --> 05:51.650

05:51.652 --> 05:52.918
Yeah, we're over it.

07:59.179 --> 08:00.345
No.

08:00.347 --> 08:02.080
I'm just tired.

08:02.082 --> 08:04.115
I actually think
I'm gonna go.

08:04.117 --> 08:05.984
Happy Halloween.

08:08.689 --> 08:10.622
She's not tired, bro.

08:10.624 --> 08:12.290
(GASPS) It can talk!

08:12.292 --> 08:14.526
<i> While my Halloween</i>
<i> had turned sour,</i>

08:14.528 --> 08:17.128
<i> Pops was busy</i>
<i> handing out sweets.</i>

08:17.130 --> 08:18.363
Ooh! Look at you!

08:18.365 --> 08:22.767
It's Spider-guy,
Strawberry Flapjacks,
and hey!

08:22.769 --> 08:24.636
It's Herman the Frog.

08:24.638 --> 08:25.670
Wokkity! Wokkity!

08:25.672 --> 08:29.074
Everything you're saying
is wrong.

08:29.076 --> 08:30.642
Enjoy!

08:31.912 --> 08:35.347
Oh, there she is.
Happy Halloween, pumpkin!

08:35.349 --> 08:37.349
There will be no more
happy Halloweens,

08:37.351 --> 08:40.252
not if I can't be out there
with my little nub-nub.

08:40.254 --> 08:41.520
I assume that's Adam.

08:41.522 --> 08:43.188
Adam is my nub-nub, yes.

08:43.190 --> 08:44.422
I don't care for nub-nub.

08:44.424 --> 08:46.525
It... It sounds
wrong to the ear.

08:46.527 --> 08:47.993
It's just...
Adam was the last one.

08:47.995 --> 08:50.295
Now what's the point
to Halloween?

08:50.297 --> 08:52.364
Hey.
You still got me.

08:52.366 --> 08:53.832
Come on,
hand out some candy.

08:53.834 --> 08:57.035
Dad, have you been
handing out this candy
the whole time?

08:57.037 --> 08:58.303
Yeah, why?

08:58.305 --> 09:01.506
Uh, where is
my deadly candy bar?

09:01.508 --> 09:02.274
What's happening?

09:02.276 --> 09:04.342
Where's my deadly
razor candy bar?

09:04.344 --> 09:05.110
What's happening?

09:05.112 --> 09:07.812
I jammed a lady razor
into a delicious treat

09:07.814 --> 09:10.815
to show Adam any crazy
person could do it.

09:10.817 --> 09:12.217
Why would you do that?

09:12.219 --> 09:13.718
You know
what a safety nut I am!

09:13.720 --> 09:15.053
I did it for safety!

09:15.055 --> 09:17.923
That is the opposite
of safety!

09:17.925 --> 09:18.323
I know!

09:18.325 --> 09:20.926
Oh, God.
I got to go find it!

09:20.928 --> 09:22.827
I must save the children!

09:22.829 --> 09:25.030
ADULT ADAM:
<i> And save them she would.</i>

09:25.032 --> 09:26.298
Safety check!

09:26.300 --> 09:28.099
Give me your candy.
No.

09:28.101 --> 09:29.768
I'm not asking,
I'm taking.

09:29.770 --> 09:30.936
Give it.
No!

09:30.938 --> 09:32.370
Give it!

09:32.372 --> 09:34.673
Young man!
Young man.

09:34.675 --> 09:37.976
I'm not a street tough,
I'm a concerned mama.

09:37.978 --> 09:39.544
I'm here for safety.

09:39.546 --> 09:40.679
Run towards safety.

09:40.681 --> 09:43.081
Run towards safety
and away from the razors.

09:43.083 --> 09:45.550
Spider-Man, give me
your (BLEEP) candy!

09:45.552 --> 09:47.018
I'm saving lives.

09:47.020 --> 09:48.853
I'm saving lives!

09:50.958 --> 09:52.357
ADULT ADAM:
<i> Halloween was in full swing,</i>

09:52.359 --> 09:55.460
<i> and the night would be</i>
<i> more trick than treat.</i>

09:55.462 --> 09:59.564
Yo! Guess who I am.

09:59.633 --> 10:00.265
Bruce Lee?

10:00.267 --> 10:03.268
What? No!
I'm Chuck Norris!

10:03.270 --> 10:03.868
Oh, yeah.

10:03.870 --> 10:07.439
It's kind of hard to read.
Can I fix it?
Please do.

10:09.309 --> 10:10.742
Perfect.

10:10.744 --> 10:12.077
You're a good person.

10:12.079 --> 10:13.945
Thanks for nothing,
jerks!

10:13.947 --> 10:17.315
You ruined my Halloween,
you ruined my relationship,

10:17.317 --> 10:18.883
and you ruined
my underpants.

10:18.885 --> 10:21.820
I haven't actually
checked yet,
but I know what I'm in for!

10:21.822 --> 10:25.423
Can we do this later?
Suck Norris and I have
several parties to hit.

10:25.425 --> 10:26.257
What?

10:26.259 --> 10:27.292
No, you can't go.

10:27.294 --> 10:29.327
I took your stupid advice,
and I freaked out

10:29.329 --> 10:30.795
in that haunted house
like a scared little baby.

10:30.797 --> 10:34.232
Dude, it's not our fault
you're a nervous,
jumpy, wuss-bag.

10:34.234 --> 10:36.468
Dana dropped her promise ring
in that haunted house.

10:36.470 --> 10:38.336
Barry, you got to go
in there and get it.

10:38.338 --> 10:40.305
No way.
We have six parties to hit.

10:40.307 --> 10:42.807
Come on, just help me.
You're always bragging

10:42.809 --> 10:45.477
that you're literally
not scared of anything
on earth.

10:45.479 --> 10:47.078
Or stuff in the sky,
like birds or meteors.

10:47.080 --> 10:50.281
And you've said many times
that you have
the strength of 10 men.

10:50.283 --> 10:51.516
And 44 medium-sized
children.

10:51.518 --> 10:53.652
And you have claimed
you're an unstoppable
killing force.

10:53.654 --> 10:58.156
I did karate kick
a jellyfish at the beach
that one time.

10:58.158 --> 11:01.393
It stung pretty bad,
but he floated away lifeless.

11:01.395 --> 11:03.795
My god!
Just go and do it already.

11:03.797 --> 11:04.629
Oh, fine.

11:04.631 --> 11:05.797
I guess
this is my burden to bear

11:05.799 --> 11:09.467
since I'm the one
born with extra testosterone
and no fear.

11:09.469 --> 11:10.168
You'll really help me?

11:10.170 --> 11:14.439
Dude, if anyone can find
that ring, it's this guy.

11:14.441 --> 11:16.574
ADULT ADAM: <i> As I was</i>
<i> in search of my ring,</i>

11:16.576 --> 11:18.643
<i> my mom was hunting down</i>
<i> her razor candy.</i>

11:18.645 --> 11:22.313
I'm home!
Come quick, I need your help.

11:27.487 --> 11:28.353
Holy crap!

11:28.355 --> 11:33.458
Did you take all that
from the tiny hands
of little children?

11:33.460 --> 11:34.893
And this.

11:35.829 --> 11:38.229
Bevy, the razor's
not in there.

11:38.231 --> 11:40.732
But it might be in here.

11:41.902 --> 11:42.567
I threw it away!

11:42.569 --> 11:45.804
You power-walked out of here
like a panther!

11:45.806 --> 11:47.172
We couldn't find you!

11:47.174 --> 11:50.141
Well, this is concerning.

11:50.143 --> 11:53.311
You... You have another bag,
don't you?

11:53.313 --> 11:55.180
ADULT ADAM: <i> She did.</i>

11:56.817 --> 11:57.882
(GRUNTS)

11:57.884 --> 12:01.086
<i> She also had three more</i>
<i> in the car.</i>

12:01.455 --> 12:03.088
Heavy. I got it.

12:04.057 --> 12:04.823
How far did you walk?

12:04.825 --> 12:08.126
Well, I didn't know
if that razor made it
to the next town.

12:08.128 --> 12:09.728
I had to be sure.

12:09.730 --> 12:10.361
(THUDDING)

12:10.363 --> 12:12.731
ADULT ADAM: <i> And all those kids</i>
<i> she stole candy from</i>

12:12.733 --> 12:15.433
<i> were for sure</i>
<i> gonna get their revenge</i>

12:15.435 --> 12:16.167
<i> with a few dozen eggs.</i>

12:16.169 --> 12:19.437
What are they doing?
Egging our house!

12:19.439 --> 12:20.605
Which we deserve.

12:20.607 --> 12:23.007
This is gonna stain
our aluminum siding!

12:23.009 --> 12:24.542
Again, well-deserved!

12:24.544 --> 12:27.312
Just give them
the candy back.

12:27.314 --> 12:28.313
(THUDDING CONTINUES)

12:28.315 --> 12:31.249
The only thing they're getting
is a lecture.

12:31.251 --> 12:32.717
ADULT ADAM: <i> My mom</i>
<i> stormed into the dark night</i>

12:32.719 --> 12:37.222
<i> to defend our home</i>
<i> against Kermit the Frog</i>
<i> and Strawberry Shortcake.</i>

12:37.224 --> 12:41.659
This is a waste
of groceries!

12:41.661 --> 12:42.060
(GRUNTS)

12:42.062 --> 12:45.130
ADULT ADAM: <i> But it became</i>
<i> an alien standoff.</i>

12:45.132 --> 12:48.032
<i> Predator versus Alf.</i>

12:48.368 --> 12:51.736
BEVERLY: Look both ways
when you cross the street!

12:52.706 --> 12:55.974
ADULT ADAM: <i> Turns out,</i>
<i> years of power-walking</i>
<i> made her a power-runner,</i>

12:55.976 --> 13:00.612
<i> and Alf's little legs</i>
<i> were no match</i>
<i> for my angry smother.</i>

13:01.381 --> 13:04.182
Hey, Bar, we don't
say this stuff much,

13:04.184 --> 13:07.018
but you're a good brother
for going in there for me.

13:07.020 --> 13:11.022
Yeah, yeah.
Thanks, I'm just gonna...
Yeah, yeah.

13:11.024 --> 13:12.724
Are you okay, man?
Of course I'm okay.

13:12.726 --> 13:14.492
Why wouldn't I be okay?
I'm an adult.

13:14.494 --> 13:16.895
(CHAINSAW MOTOR REVS)
Aah! What was that?

13:16.897 --> 13:17.462
Are you okay, man?

13:17.464 --> 13:19.864
Yeah! I just had
the bravery shakes, God.

13:19.866 --> 13:21.966
What's happening with you
right now?

13:21.968 --> 13:23.201
Look, I know
for some reason

13:23.203 --> 13:25.170
you think I have
extra testosterone
and no fear.

13:25.172 --> 13:30.175
Yeah, 'cause you've said
those exact words
for the last 10 years.

13:30.177 --> 13:31.976
Right, but the truth is,

13:31.978 --> 13:35.180
I actually have
a normal amount
of testosterone

13:35.182 --> 13:37.715
and a tremendous amount
of fear.

13:37.717 --> 13:38.716
Then why would you say it?

13:38.718 --> 13:41.619
I say it 'cause
people finding out
about my fear

13:41.621 --> 13:44.389
is my greatest fear.
(GROANS)

13:44.391 --> 13:45.857
Fine! Erica, you go in.

13:45.859 --> 13:50.061
Pass.
Seriously? You're scared
of haunted houses, too?

13:50.063 --> 13:50.695
Hell, no.

13:50.697 --> 13:52.430
But there's a frat guy
I made out with in there,

13:52.432 --> 13:56.167
and if I see him,
I know I'll fall
right back into it.

13:56.169 --> 13:58.369
And that's
my greatest fear.

13:58.371 --> 14:00.338
Or at least something
I would like to avoid.

14:00.340 --> 14:01.673
Come on!
Safety in numbers!

14:01.675 --> 14:03.808
We just have to
stick together.

14:03.944 --> 14:05.210
Okay, let's do this.

14:05.212 --> 14:07.946
But, wait!
How's my hair?

14:10.116 --> 14:11.382
Good.

14:11.384 --> 14:12.050
Yeah.

14:12.052 --> 14:14.586
ADULT ADAM: <i> And with that,</i>
<i> the three of faced our fears.</i>

14:14.588 --> 14:20.258
<i> The plan was simple,</i>

14:35.775 --> 14:37.508
But what about
sticking together?

So, Anton,
did you like, um,

14:39.946 --> 14:42.347
lose my number
or something?

14:45.518 --> 14:48.119

That's not how fog works!

Goodbye, Barry!
You were a terrible brother,
but I love you!

ADULT ADAM: <i> That night,</i>
<i> I wasn't the only one</i>

15:03.403 --> 15:05.136
<i> facing an angry monster.</i>

15:05.138 --> 15:06.704
Shame on you kids.

15:06.706 --> 15:11.576
Running around like hooligans
in the night, egging my house.

15:11.578 --> 15:14.312
(CHUCKLES) Your mothers
have failed as mothers,

15:14.314 --> 15:17.548

when I call them.

15:18.051 --> 15:18.683
Hello.

15:18.685 --> 15:21.252
May I give you another take
on this situation?

15:21.254 --> 15:22.020
Not now.
I'm on a roll.

15:22.022 --> 15:24.889
Has it occurred to you
that these children's parents

15:24.891 --> 15:27.258
might think differently,
given all the facts?

15:27.260 --> 15:30.061
It has not occurred to me
and will continue
to not occur to me.

15:30.063 --> 15:34.365
Well, it occurs to me
you've become everything
you fear on Halloween.

15:34.367 --> 15:35.800
Please. I have not.

15:35.802 --> 15:37.635
You hid a razor
in a chocolate bar.

15:37.637 --> 15:38.403
To prove a point.

15:38.405 --> 15:42.040
You stole candy from children
like a street tough.

15:42.042 --> 15:43.041
To protect them.

15:43.043 --> 15:46.210
And then there's
the kidnappings.

15:46.212 --> 15:47.912
All I did
was round them up

15:47.914 --> 15:49.547
and force them
into my house and...

15:49.549 --> 15:52.517
Oh, my God, that is bad.
(GASPS)

15:52.719 --> 15:53.184
Hiya, guys.

15:53.186 --> 15:56.921
On your way out,
you'll each find
a bag of candy

15:56.923 --> 15:58.222
that I put a $5 bill in,

15:58.224 --> 16:01.626
so maybe you shouldn't
mention this to your parents.

16:01.628 --> 16:04.262
And by the way,
have a happy Halloween.

16:04.264 --> 16:06.164
Your wife's nuts, dude.

16:06.166 --> 16:08.299
(LAUGHING) Oh, yeah.

16:10.937 --> 16:11.602
Kermit's right.

16:11.604 --> 16:13.504
I really did
lose it tonight.

16:13.506 --> 16:15.373
It's just Halloween.
Who cares?

16:15.375 --> 16:19.544
Don't you understand
what this night means to me?

16:19.546 --> 16:20.979
(SIGHS)

16:20.981 --> 16:21.746
No matter how old Adam got,

16:21.748 --> 16:25.950
he was always so happy
when we would go out
and get candy.

16:25.952 --> 16:28.252
His smile,
the excitement,

16:28.254 --> 16:31.255
his sweaty little hand
reaching up to grab mine,

16:31.257 --> 16:37.128
and now his sweaty little hand
is grabbing someone else's.

16:37.130 --> 16:39.464
He'll never need me again.

16:41.501 --> 16:44.002
You got anything savory?

Please leave.

I thought, "Well, if you're
in a couples costume,

17:07.293 --> 17:09.060
"you might as well
be with someone

17:09.062 --> 17:11.429
"you're in
an actual couple with."

17:11.431 --> 17:13.965
You put together
this stupid thing for me?

17:13.967 --> 17:18.136
Yeah, you know, I'm not one
for sentimental crap.

17:18.138 --> 17:19.103
God! Son of a bitch!

17:19.105 --> 17:20.438
Just take it off.
I can't!

17:20.440 --> 17:24.142
This is a child's helmet.
It's like
sucking on my head.

17:24.144 --> 17:25.276
My head's in a vacuum.

17:25.278 --> 17:26.377
Why would you just
jam it on?

17:26.379 --> 17:29.514
The more you pull it off,
the more it clamps!

17:29.516 --> 17:30.748
Why would you do this?

17:30.750 --> 17:31.983
I just thought, you know,

17:31.985 --> 17:33.818
you can't have Halloween
with the kids anymore,

17:33.820 --> 17:36.621
and maybe you could
have Halloween with me.

17:37.957 --> 17:39.891
That is so sweet.

17:39.893 --> 17:41.159
And I would love that.

17:41.161 --> 17:42.293
Mama, I need you!

17:42.295 --> 17:44.195
Move!
Boopie, what's wrong?

17:44.197 --> 17:47.498
It's Barry!
He twisted his ankle
in the haunted house.

17:47.500 --> 17:48.199
Oh, no. Where's Erica?

17:48.201 --> 17:50.968
She's in there, too,
with a frat boy named Anton.

17:50.970 --> 17:52.570
Oh, hell, no!

17:52.572 --> 17:54.439
<i> ¶ We're running with</i>
<i> the shadows of the night</i>

17:54.441 --> 17:57.341
All right, so we'll put a pin
in the couples costume.

17:57.343 --> 18:00.511
Maybe after Adam
goes to college.

18:00.513 --> 18:02.847
<i> ¶ They'll come true</i>
(GROANS)

18:02.849 --> 18:05.950
<i> ¶ In the end</i>

18:10.023 --> 18:11.956
(GROWLS)

18:13.359 --> 18:14.459
ADULT ADAM:
<i> Turns out, that night,</i>

18:14.461 --> 18:18.596
<i> the scariest thing in that</i>
<i> haunted house was my mom.</i>

18:18.598 --> 18:19.964
What the...

18:19.966 --> 18:21.165
BEVERLY: Move it!

18:21.167 --> 18:21.999
Out of my way!

18:22.001 --> 18:23.334
<i> ¶ You said, oh, girl</i>
Back off, punk!

18:23.336 --> 18:25.103
<i> ¶ It's a cold world</i>
Oh!

18:25.105 --> 18:28.106
<i> ¶ When you keep it all</i>
<i> to yourself</i>
Mom kick!

18:29.175 --> 18:29.841
Mom slap!

18:29.843 --> 18:31.509
<i> ¶ I said, you can't hide</i>
You! Out!

18:31.511 --> 18:33.478
Damn it! Call me?
<i> ¶ On the inside</i>

18:33.480 --> 18:37.415
<i> ¶ All the pain</i>
<i> you've ever felt</i>
Do not call her!

18:37.684 --> 18:39.951
ADULT ADAM: <i> Dana's ring</i>
<i> wasn't the only thing</i>
<i> I found that night.</i>

18:39.953 --> 18:44.689
<i> I also discovered</i>
<i> that my mom and I</i>
<i> made quite the team.</i>

18:44.691 --> 18:45.623
I found the ring.

18:45.625 --> 18:47.892
Then go. I'll stay
and find your brother.

18:47.894 --> 18:50.061
<i> ¶ We're running with</i>
<i> the shadows of the night</i>
Thanks, mama.

18:50.063 --> 18:52.463
You got it,
my little alien.

18:52.765 --> 18:53.531
<i> ¶ So, baby, take my hand</i>

18:53.533 --> 18:56.300
ADULT ADAM: <i> And even though</i>
<i> that was our last</i>
<i> couples costume,</i>

18:56.302 --> 18:58.603
<i> it turned out to be</i>
<i> the best one ever.</i>

18:58.605 --> 19:00.071
<i> ¶ Surrender all your dreams</i>
<i> to me tonight</i>

19:00.073 --> 19:04.575
<i> As much as my mom savored</i>
<i> every single Halloween</i>
<i> when I was little,</i>

19:04.577 --> 19:07.545
<i> this was the one</i>
<i> she'd remember forever.</i>

19:08.014 --> 19:09.647
Aah! My ankle.

19:09.649 --> 19:13.084
It's all right, love bug.
You're safe now.

19:13.086 --> 19:15.319
You hear that, Bar?
Mom saved us.

19:15.321 --> 19:17.688
We are the luckiest kids
in the world.

19:17.690 --> 19:19.056
You're grounded
for a month.

19:19.058 --> 19:20.191
For sure.
(CHUCKLES)

19:20.193 --> 19:23.861
<i> ¶ Use every alibi</i>
<i> and words you deny</i>

19:23.863 --> 19:27.331
<i> ¶ That love ain't meant</i>

19:27.800 --> 19:29.934
<i> ¶ You can cry tough, baby</i>

19:29.936 --> 19:31.602
<i> ¶ It's all right</i>
ADULT ADAM:
<i> That's the thing about love.</i>

19:31.604 --> 19:33.404
<i> ¶ You can let me down easy</i>
<i> When you face your fears...</i>

19:33.406 --> 19:35.072
<i> ¶ But not tonight</i>
<i> ...you can finally</i>
<i> take off your mask</i>

19:35.074 --> 19:37.408
<i> and show people</i>
<i> who you really are.</i>

19:37.410 --> 19:41.479
<i> ¶ We're running with</i>
<i> the shadows of the night</i>

19:41.481 --> 19:44.115
<i> ¶ So, baby, take my hand,</i>
<i> it'll be all right</i>

19:44.117 --> 19:45.516
Sorry for using you
as a human shield and all.

19:45.518 --> 19:49.854
<i> ¶ Surrender all your dreams</i>
<i> to me tonight</i>
Well, you went back in.

19:49.856 --> 19:51.189
<i> ¶ They'll come true</i>
It was so scary in there.

19:51.191 --> 19:54.492
<i> ¶ In the end</i>
It was, but losing you
was even scarier.

19:54.494 --> 19:55.793
<i> ¶ We're running with</i>
<i> the shadows of the night</i>

19:55.795 --> 19:57.395
You know,
Halloween isn't over.

19:57.397 --> 19:58.796
It... It's not too late
to get some candy.

19:58.798 --> 20:00.665
<i> ¶ So, baby, take my hand</i>
<i> it'll be all right</i>
Candy sounds great.

20:00.667 --> 20:03.234
<i> ¶ Surrender all your dreams</i>
<i> to me tonight</i>
ADULT ADAM: <i> So my first</i>

20:03.236 --> 20:05.570
<i> adult Halloween ended</i>
<i> the way it always did,</i>

20:05.572 --> 20:06.470
<i> with me and Dana</i>
<i> getting candy.</i>

20:06.472 --> 20:09.640
<i> ¶ They'll come true in the end</i>
<i> And it couldn't have been</i>
<i> more perfect.</i>

20:09.642 --> 20:11.309
You gonna go keep him safe?

20:11.311 --> 20:12.543
<i> ¶ We're running with</i>
<i> the shadows of the night</i>

20:12.545 --> 20:16.614
Actually, I think
he'll be all right
without me.

20:16.616 --> 20:18.416
<i> ¶ So, baby, take my hand,</i>
<i> it'll be all right</i>

20:18.418 --> 20:20.751
But watching from a distance
can't hurt.

20:20.753 --> 20:23.921
<i> ¶ Surrender all your dreams</i>
<i> to me tonight ¶</i>

20:23.923 --> 20:25.623
ADULT ADAM: <i> Growing up,</i>
<i> there's a lot to be afraid of,</i>

20:25.625 --> 20:29.860
<i> but when you know</i>
<i> in your heart</i>
<i> your family has your back,</i>

20:29.862 --> 20:32.530
<i> nothing in life is scary.</i>

20:41.241 --> 20:43.241
BOY 1: Yo, man,
this place is really crazy.

20:43.243 --> 20:47.311
BOY2: I KNOW.
God, it looks
scary in the dark.

20:47.313 --> 20:49.113
Oh, this is so creepy.

20:49.115 --> 20:50.581
Look at the cobwebs.

20:50.583 --> 20:52.984
Whoa. What's that?

20:53.119 --> 20:53.884
What was that?

20:53.886 --> 20:55.753
MAN: Aah!
(BOYS SCREAMS)

21:00.293 --> 21:02.994
BEVERLY:
Who wants waffles?

21:03.596 --> 21:05.763
Kids, come on down!

21:05.765 --> 21:07.298
Here you go, Murray.
(PLATE SHATTERS)

21:07.300 --> 21:11.302
Oops. I almost forgot...
I need to get
the kids' lunch money.

21:11.304 --> 21:14.805
Mom's got to stop wearing
her old Halloween costume.
She won't.

21:14.807 --> 21:18.276
BEVERLY:
Whoever's standing there,
let go of my purse.

21:18.278 --> 21:19.143
Her new perm
didn't settle right.

21:19.145 --> 21:21.779
She doesn't want anyone to see
what's going on under there.
(THUMPING)

21:21.781 --> 21:24.915
BEVERLY: (LAUGHS)
Still getting the hang
of this thing.

21:24.917 --> 21:26.984
Yeah, we should go.

21:26.986 --> 21:28.219
BEVERLY: Help your mother.

21:28.221 --> 21:30.888
You have 30 seconds
to comply.
