00:04.000 --> 00:05.718
Previously, on Enterprise:

00:06.080 --> 00:08.355
This species has technology which
allows them...

00:08.480 --> 00:10.471
to examine alternate timelines.

00:10.880 --> 00:13.678
They've seen this future,
and they want to change the outcome.

00:13.880 --> 00:16.758
We've got less than 10 hours
before this weapon reaches Earth.

00:17.000 --> 00:19.275
The Captain wants to take
a team aboard to destroy it.

00:22.560 --> 00:24.710
- Give me the charges.
- I'll take care of it, sir.

00:24.840 --> 00:26.353
Don't worry, I'll be right behind you.

00:32.159 --> 00:33.912
Captain Archer destroyed the weapon.

00:34.040 --> 00:36.998
- Where is he? Is he okay?
- Captain didn't make it, Trip.

00:37.400 --> 00:38.355
Prepare a shuttlepod.

00:38.480 --> 00:40.948
I want you and Ensign Mayweather
to get down to San Francisco.

00:41.080 --> 00:42.308
Find out what's wrong.

00:42.640 --> 00:43.595
Sir.

00:45.000 --> 00:51.074

01:08.240 --> 01:11.676
This is Commander Charles Tucker
of the Starship Enterprise.

01:12.880 --> 01:14.598
What the hell are you people doing?

01:14.920 --> 01:17.753
Those are P-51s.
I've seen them at air shows.

01:17.960 --> 01:20.633
- I don't think this is an air show.
- Are they breaking off?

01:25.520 --> 01:26.999
Maybe we should follow them.

01:27.840 --> 01:29.910
Try to find a landing port, set us down.

01:36.920 --> 01:39.673
- Starboard injector.
- Get us out of here.

01:48.040 --> 01:50.395
It's been a long road

01:53.440 --> 01:54.793
Gettin' from there to here

01:55.320 --> 01:57.515
It's been a long time

01:59.000 --> 02:02.276
But my time is finally near

02:02.720 --> 02:05.917
And I will see my dream
Come alive at last

02:06.800 --> 02:10.110
I will touch the sky

02:10.240 --> 02:13.710
And they're not gonna
Hold me down no more

02:13.840 --> 02:16.559
No, they're not gonna change my mind

02:17.040 --> 02:20.953
'Cause I've got aith of the heart

02:21.640 --> 02:24.438
I'm going where my heart will take me

02:24.560 --> 02:28.599
I've got faith to believe

02:29.200 --> 02:31.760
I can do anything

02:31.960 --> 02:35.748
I've got strength of the soul

02:36.400 --> 02:39.073
And no one's gonna bend or break me

02:39.280 --> 02:43.034
I can reach any star

02:44.840 --> 02:46.956
I've got faith

02:48.520 --> 02:51.239
I've got faith

02:52.240 --> 02:55.277
Faith of the heart

03:24.600 --> 03:26.158
Rita Hayworth...

03:26.720 --> 03:28.073
Veronica Lake...

03:29.160 --> 03:30.388
Betty Grable.

03:31.960 --> 03:35.589
Americans are good at making movies.
They are not so good at fighting.

03:36.760 --> 03:39.479
Someday, I will go to Hollywood...

03:39.880 --> 03:41.836
and I will meet Betty Grable.

03:42.800 --> 03:45.360
Maybe you will introduce me, huh?
What do you think?

03:47.040 --> 03:48.189
She's not your type.

03:50.600 --> 03:54.388
You know, in Hollywood movies,
Americans always win.

03:55.560 --> 03:57.755
Too bad for you, you are not in a movie.

03:59.120 --> 04:00.189
Insurgents!

04:06.440 --> 04:08.317
Keep driving! Move!

05:00.640 --> 05:04.838
As to the youth of all the Britons, I say:

05:04.960 --> 05:09.556
You cannot stop.
There is no halting place at this point.

05:10.040 --> 05:12.395
We have now reached a point
in the journey...

05:12.520 --> 05:14.556
where there can be no pause.

05:14.880 --> 05:15.995
We must go on.

05:16.640 --> 05:20.315
It must be world anarchy or world order.

05:21.680 --> 05:23.113
That was Winston Churchill.

05:24.160 --> 05:25.957
I picked that up half an hour ago.

05:26.080 --> 05:27.559
Well, it's true then.

05:28.600 --> 05:31.068
We are over 200 years in the past.

05:31.960 --> 05:34.428
I've also intercepted
several military dispatches.

05:34.680 --> 05:38.036
And their radio programme,
something called The Shadow.

05:38.720 --> 05:42.156
We should run a complete diagnostic.
Start with the sensor array.

05:42.280 --> 05:44.510
This isn't a damn sensor glitch.

05:44.640 --> 05:47.837
We just pulled three.50-calibre bullets
from the shuttlepod hull.

05:48.280 --> 05:51.238
And spare us the official Vulcan position
about time travel.

05:51.480 --> 05:54.233
We are 200 years in the past. Face it.

05:55.000 --> 05:58.993
The first step to getting back
is ascertaining how we got here.

05:59.720 --> 06:01.676
As soon as the diagnostic is complete...

06:01.800 --> 06:03.870
run a scan for any anomalies
in the area.

06:04.000 --> 06:05.035
Right away.

06:06.560 --> 06:08.437
Maybe we're here for a reason.

06:11.480 --> 06:13.198
Maybe this wasn't an accident.

06:13.600 --> 06:16.160
For the moment,
we can't rule out any possibilities.

06:32.760 --> 06:35.399
The Germans believe
there are 5,000 resistance fighters...

06:35.520 --> 06:37.158
operating throughout the region.

06:37.760 --> 06:41.958
They're becoming better organized,
increasing their attacks.

06:44.120 --> 06:46.111
We lost four men in the assault.

06:46.520 --> 06:48.829
You should have chosen a safer route.

06:49.840 --> 06:53.116
And you should have
personally overseen the transfer.

06:53.240 --> 06:56.038
We were in the midst
of a crucial weapons test.

06:56.240 --> 06:59.915
- He was just an American prisoner.
- He was more than that.

07:00.760 --> 07:02.830
This communication device
he was carrying....

07:04.560 --> 07:05.959
It's from the future.

07:07.400 --> 07:08.992
A temporal agent?

07:09.600 --> 07:12.717
Double the security details
at all the entrances to the compound.

07:13.640 --> 07:15.039
If they have located us...

07:16.160 --> 07:17.912
it won't be long before they strike.

07:18.040 --> 07:20.395
How could they have possibly found us?

07:21.640 --> 07:23.278
If the prisoner hadn't escaped...

07:23.400 --> 07:25.152
we might know the answer
to that question.

07:27.640 --> 07:29.517
You know what I expect of you.

07:29.640 --> 07:32.029
The prisoner will be recovered.

07:39.560 --> 07:40.675
Come in.

07:43.080 --> 07:44.354
You got a second?

07:45.480 --> 07:48.358
I wanted to say,
I was way out of line earlier.

07:48.840 --> 07:51.798
You have enough to worry about
without me flying off the handle.

07:52.240 --> 07:53.878
Your reaction was understandable.

07:54.120 --> 07:56.634
I was just all set to get home.

07:57.440 --> 08:00.193
I wasn't expecting to be
in the middle of another situation.

08:00.960 --> 08:02.279
None of us were.

08:02.800 --> 08:04.836
I was also looking forward
to going home.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.434
I thought perhaps
I would return to Vulcan.

08:09.120 --> 08:12.237
- It's been some time since I was there.
- Sounds nice.

08:12.880 --> 08:15.917
I was gonna lay on a different beach
every week for two months.

08:16.200 --> 08:18.350
The only thing to figure out...

08:18.480 --> 08:20.630
was whether to start in Tahiti
or in CancÃºn.

08:21.960 --> 08:25.748
The Captain would always try to put
the best light on the worst situation.

08:28.000 --> 08:29.718
I wonder what he'd say to this one.

08:30.640 --> 08:33.837
I think he'd be hard- pressed
to find any positive aspects.

08:36.240 --> 08:38.071
But he would try, nevertheless.

08:40.840 --> 08:41.955
Come in.

08:44.159 --> 08:47.277
I've been going over those military
dispatches that Hoshi picked up.

08:47.400 --> 08:48.799
Some of them don't make sense.

08:48.920 --> 08:51.992
They mention recent battles
in Virginia and Ohio.

08:52.600 --> 08:54.591
There weren't any battles fought there
in World War II.

08:54.720 --> 08:56.438
The Nazis never got to North America.

08:57.080 --> 08:58.798
Something's very wrong down there.

09:00.000 --> 09:04.073
It's chicken liver, your favourite,
with grated cheddar.

09:08.160 --> 09:11.357
No, I can't say I blame you.
I don't have much of an appetite myself.

09:13.800 --> 09:17.190
Perhaps a Denobulan lullaby
will improve your mood?

09:18.720 --> 09:22.269
On the other hand, my singing
would often drive my children to tears.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.673
Maybe what you need
is a nice thick steak.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.389
I'll see what Chef has on the menu.
Be right back.

09:55.200 --> 09:57.270
Hey, it's okay, it's all right.

09:57.720 --> 09:58.789
I'm a friend.

10:00.320 --> 10:03.835
Just cleaning you up a little.
War's a dirty business.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.753
But you're lucky.
Bullet just missed the bone.

10:10.760 --> 10:11.749
Where am I?

10:11.880 --> 10:14.758
In my apartment. What's left of it.

10:15.800 --> 10:17.472
I'm Alicia Travers.

10:18.720 --> 10:20.995
- Jonathan Archer.
- Pleased to meet you.

10:22.600 --> 10:24.238
What's the last thing you remember?

10:26.600 --> 10:30.798
I was in a truck
with a couple of German soldiers.

10:32.120 --> 10:34.714
There was an explosion,
someone started shooting at us.

10:35.240 --> 10:37.196
- I got away.
- You sure did.

10:37.640 --> 10:39.073
And your SS friends...

10:39.720 --> 10:41.995
they're dead, which is how I like them.

10:42.760 --> 10:46.036
You're my first bona fide POW.

10:46.320 --> 10:48.754
I usually fix up guys in the resistance.

10:49.400 --> 10:51.436
Easy, sailor.

10:52.080 --> 10:54.594
- You don't want to start bleeding again.
- Sailor?

10:54.840 --> 10:57.115
Yeah, that patch on your shirt
says "Enterprise. "

10:57.240 --> 10:59.390
You must have made it off
before it sank.

10:59.520 --> 11:01.431
How'd you wind up
all the way over here?

11:02.880 --> 11:04.916
I've been asking myself
the same question.

11:14.560 --> 11:15.913
What year is this?

11:17.400 --> 11:20.517
- It's 1944.
- World War II.

11:20.800 --> 11:25.316
I haven't heard it called that before,
but that's as good a description as any.

11:28.480 --> 11:31.631
Used to be a pretty nice neighbourhood,
even for coloureds.

11:32.640 --> 11:34.915
As you can see, it's gone downhill.

11:37.800 --> 11:39.153
Where are we?

11:40.480 --> 11:41.674
We in Brooklyn.

11:43.200 --> 11:44.428
New York City?

11:57.840 --> 12:00.673
The weapon fires
a modulating plasma pulse...

12:01.120 --> 12:05.159
equivalent to the energy produced
by three 88 mm shells.

12:05.880 --> 12:08.553
Each pulse can destroy a tank.

12:10.880 --> 12:14.316
Very impressive.
When can we expect deployment?

12:14.520 --> 12:16.476
I can't give you a specific timetable.

12:16.920 --> 12:19.354
There are still some problems
to be addressed.

12:19.480 --> 12:21.391
- Such as?
- Portability.

12:22.120 --> 12:24.429
The weapons require
considerable power.

12:24.680 --> 12:27.752
In my century, there are energy cells
the size of a coin.

12:28.600 --> 12:29.828
In this century...

12:31.720 --> 12:33.790
it's somewhat more difficult.

12:34.480 --> 12:35.833
What are these?

12:36.120 --> 12:40.318
Requisition forms.
I require additional supplies.

12:40.720 --> 12:43.439
"86 metric tons of aluminium plating.

12:43.840 --> 12:46.434
"170 tons of carbon steel."

12:46.560 --> 12:49.916
We can't keep diverting vital materials
from war production.

12:50.680 --> 12:53.752
We are inside the home
of the former American president.

12:54.480 --> 12:57.278
It seems to me your war effort
is going well enough.

12:57.520 --> 12:59.954
That could change very quickly.

13:02.400 --> 13:06.279
Intelligence suggests the Americans
are preparing a counterattack.

13:07.920 --> 13:10.036
Our front lines are dangerously thin.

13:10.520 --> 13:14.229
Supply routes are under constant attack
from resistance fighters.

13:14.360 --> 13:17.636
A forceful enemy thrust could stand
a good chance of breaking through.

13:17.760 --> 13:19.193
On top of this...

13:19.560 --> 13:21.312
there've been setbacks in Africa...

13:21.640 --> 13:24.154
and the Russians are attempting
to retake Moscow.

13:27.680 --> 13:30.035
While no one has expressed
this to the FÃ¼hrer...

13:30.160 --> 13:34.199
there is widespread belief that Germany
has advanced too far too quickly.

13:34.440 --> 13:37.159
All the more reason
to accede to my request.

13:37.640 --> 13:38.868
The weapons I'm preparing...

13:39.000 --> 13:41.309
will make you immune
from any counterattack...

13:41.440 --> 13:42.919
anywhere in the world...

13:43.200 --> 13:46.397
and I'm not just referring
to plasma rifles.

13:46.920 --> 13:48.956
Imagine a plague...

13:50.120 --> 13:52.759
targeting non-Aryans.

13:54.160 --> 13:56.833
No need for extermination camps.

13:57.520 --> 14:01.559
Just a few grams of a pathogen
introduced into the water supply.

14:01.680 --> 14:03.671
You make promises.
All we ever see are films.

14:03.800 --> 14:06.519
There is far too much at stake
for us to argue.

14:06.640 --> 14:08.312
We have far too much in common.

14:08.480 --> 14:11.790
We both embrace the ideals
of purity and perfection...

14:12.040 --> 14:14.759
and we both face enemies
that would destroy us.

14:15.160 --> 14:17.993
Now is not the time to end
an association...

14:18.120 --> 14:20.634
that is vital to our mutual survival.

14:21.760 --> 14:24.513
No one has proposed ending anything.

14:28.000 --> 14:30.753
Then I'll expect delivery
by the end of the week.

14:38.400 --> 14:41.198
Portions of Daniels' body have aged
at a dramatic rate.

14:41.320 --> 14:43.629
In some areas,
the tissue is over 100 years old.

14:43.760 --> 14:47.309
Yet, other sections have been reduced
to an almost foetal stage.

14:47.640 --> 14:49.551
Do you have any theories
as to what caused this?

14:49.680 --> 14:51.318
It's not any kind of infectious organism...

14:51.440 --> 14:53.954
at least, nothing that shows up
on my medical scanner.

14:57.880 --> 14:59.154
Will he survive?

14:59.400 --> 15:01.311
Frankly,
with his amount of cellular chaos...

15:01.440 --> 15:02.668
I'm surprised he's still alive.

15:02.800 --> 15:04.677
I doubt he'll live more than 24 hours.

15:06.560 --> 15:09.438
He very well could be responsible
for our being here.

15:10.840 --> 15:14.150
He could also be the only hope
of getting back to our own time.

15:14.280 --> 15:16.316
It is imperative that I speak with him.

15:57.360 --> 15:59.191
- Vic's been arrested.
- When?

15:59.600 --> 16:00.635
A few hours ago.

16:00.760 --> 16:02.398
The Gestapo's clearing out
entire buildings...

16:02.520 --> 16:03.873
shooting people in the street.

16:04.000 --> 16:05.479
They're looking for you.

16:06.280 --> 16:09.431
The Germans are offering $10,000
for information leading to your capture.

16:09.560 --> 16:10.549
Why?

16:11.280 --> 16:13.714
- Can't tell you.
- Look, you son of a bitch...

16:14.120 --> 16:17.669
my friend is probably being tortured
right now. I want to know why.

16:18.720 --> 16:19.948
It's classified.

16:21.160 --> 16:22.149
I won't tell anyone.

16:22.280 --> 16:23.713
- Sal.
- Shut up!

16:23.840 --> 16:25.114
You got three seconds.

16:25.320 --> 16:26.275
One...

16:27.200 --> 16:29.270
two...three.

16:29.400 --> 16:33.518
Come on, Sal. Take it easy.
Come on, now. Easy.

16:37.920 --> 16:40.309
All I can tell you is
we're on the same side.

16:41.640 --> 16:43.198
Damn military.

16:43.560 --> 16:46.870
You cut and run, you leave us
at the mercy of these Nazi bastards.

16:47.000 --> 16:48.433
I didn't cut and run.

16:48.560 --> 16:51.028
Oh, yeah, I forgot.
It was an orderly retreat.

17:01.920 --> 17:05.595
Vic might break.
If he talks, it won't be safe here.

17:06.119 --> 17:07.633
- We've been through this.
- Alicia.

17:07.760 --> 17:10.637
This is my home. I'm not leaving.

17:19.400 --> 17:22.631
We're going to see if we can find out
any more information about Vic.

17:34.320 --> 17:36.834
He's conscious,
but I don't know for how long.

17:42.560 --> 17:46.872
- Where's Captain Archer?
- Captain Archer is dead.

17:48.080 --> 17:50.275
He was on the Xindi weapon
when it exploded.

17:50.800 --> 17:53.189
Are you responsible
for sending us back in time?

17:55.560 --> 17:56.629
Why?

17:57.440 --> 18:01.035
The Temporal Cold War
has become an all-out conflict.

18:02.280 --> 18:03.679
Temporal agents...

18:04.400 --> 18:07.358
dozens of them stationed
throughout the timeline.

18:07.920 --> 18:10.275
They've been given orders
to change history.

18:10.960 --> 18:12.234
For what purpose?

18:12.360 --> 18:15.079
Each faction is trying
to wipe the others out.

18:16.960 --> 18:19.190
It's a fight for dominance.

18:21.080 --> 18:22.399
Daniels.

18:23.080 --> 18:26.311
The events of this period
don't correspond with recorded history.

18:26.600 --> 18:29.717
Germany has launched
a successful invasion...

18:29.840 --> 18:31.193
of the United States.

18:31.480 --> 18:33.994
Different incursions
are causing paradoxes.

18:34.760 --> 18:36.432
Turbulence in the time stream.

18:37.000 --> 18:38.752
I almost didn't make it back.

18:45.560 --> 18:50.031
- How do we return to our century?
- You can't. It doesn't exist.

18:51.520 --> 18:54.990
Not the way you know it.
Neither does mine.

18:56.080 --> 18:57.559
It's all gone.

18:59.440 --> 19:01.112
You have to stop him.

19:02.680 --> 19:03.715
Stop who?

19:05.960 --> 19:06.915
Daniels.

19:07.880 --> 19:09.108
Stop who?

19:09.560 --> 19:12.916
We're conducting extensive sweeps
within a 15-mile radius of the ambush.

19:13.040 --> 19:14.075
We haven't found the prisoner...

19:14.200 --> 19:16.873
but we have taken in several members
of the resistance.

19:17.000 --> 19:18.433
They're being interrogated.

19:18.560 --> 19:21.632
There's one that I suspect took part
in the ambush.

19:22.240 --> 19:24.754
We're picking up scans
from a ship in orbit.

19:25.560 --> 19:27.869
It's from the same time period
as the device we found...

19:28.000 --> 19:29.353
on the escaped prisoner.

19:29.600 --> 19:32.034
This resistance member
you're interrogating....

19:32.240 --> 19:33.195
Yes?

19:37.240 --> 19:38.593
Bring him to me.

19:42.280 --> 19:43.315
Not bad.

19:49.760 --> 19:51.398
Where's your husband now?

19:51.680 --> 19:54.513
He's in the Pacific, on a destroyer.

19:55.440 --> 19:57.749
I hear the war isn't going any better
over there.

19:58.880 --> 20:00.916
Don't be expecting a second course.

20:09.120 --> 20:11.873
- It's not bad.
- You're a rotten liar.

20:13.520 --> 20:15.511
All the good stuff goes to the Germans.

20:20.200 --> 20:21.713
I still can't believe it.

20:24.800 --> 20:27.155
You know, that they're actually here.

20:30.040 --> 20:31.473
I'll never forget...

20:31.760 --> 20:34.752
the day I saw that first German tank
rolling up Flatbush.

20:36.160 --> 20:38.355
All the people streaming across
the Brooklyn Bridge...

20:38.480 --> 20:40.710
trying to get out of Manhattan.

20:41.600 --> 20:43.670
The President on the radio,
vowing to persevere...

20:43.800 --> 20:46.155
right before the government
evacuated Washington.

20:52.920 --> 20:54.148
Right on time.

20:58.880 --> 21:00.199
Billie Holiday.

21:00.960 --> 21:03.713
Good to know there's something
that you remember.

21:17.520 --> 21:19.431
Germans outlawed coloured music.

21:22.400 --> 21:24.709
Some of the neighbours
pass a phonograph...

21:24.840 --> 21:26.558
from house to house every night...

21:28.120 --> 21:31.874
so the Germans can't find it.
Just another way of telling them off.

21:37.560 --> 21:38.754
Alicia.

21:41.240 --> 21:44.073
I'm gonna ask you something.
It's gonna sound a little strange.

21:44.200 --> 21:45.428
What else is new?

21:48.120 --> 21:49.951
When I was in a German medical tent...

21:50.080 --> 21:51.911
one of the soldiers
who came in to see me...

21:53.760 --> 21:55.398
wasn't like the other ones.

21:55.920 --> 21:59.037
He had grey skin, red eyes.

22:02.160 --> 22:03.434
He wasn't human.

22:08.280 --> 22:10.999
This isn't the first time
you've heard something like this.

22:11.120 --> 22:15.113
Sal mentioned some stories once,
but I didn't believe him.

22:15.240 --> 22:16.832
They may be more than stories.

22:16.960 --> 22:20.270
I need to track down this soldier I saw.

22:21.240 --> 22:22.514
It's very important.

22:24.080 --> 22:25.513
Would you contact Sal?

22:33.440 --> 22:35.032
EPS conduit's fried.

22:35.160 --> 22:38.118
Get to Engineering and pull a fresh one
out of the injector assembly.

22:38.240 --> 22:39.798
Yes, Commander.

22:45.600 --> 22:46.635
Walsh?

23:11.880 --> 23:13.074
Commander.

23:14.120 --> 23:15.155
Silik.

23:15.600 --> 23:17.716
- Son of a bitch.
- Climb in.

23:17.840 --> 23:18.989
You brought us here.

23:19.200 --> 23:21.077
- No.
- Then who did?

23:21.200 --> 23:23.714
What's happening
is beyond your comprehension.

23:24.280 --> 23:26.111
Get in the shuttlepod.

23:28.800 --> 23:32.190
I would rather not have to discharge
this weapon.

24:02.840 --> 24:04.558
Bay 1 is depressurising.

24:05.280 --> 24:07.999
- Someone's launching a shuttlepod.
- Hail them.

24:08.280 --> 24:10.430
I'm picking up one life-sign aboard.

24:10.560 --> 24:12.073
It's Suliban.

24:14.760 --> 24:15.988
Phase-cannons.

24:28.480 --> 24:30.436
If this Nazi wasn't a human,
what was he?

24:31.280 --> 24:32.315
I don't know.

24:32.440 --> 24:34.192
Just tell Sal I want to talk to him.

24:34.880 --> 24:36.074
All right.

24:36.600 --> 24:38.192
Here, it's hamburger.

24:39.280 --> 24:41.510
Germans are cutting
the meat ration again.

24:41.640 --> 24:44.871
- It's going to be worth its weight in gold.
- Thanks, Carmine.

24:45.600 --> 24:46.999
Watch yourselves.

24:52.640 --> 24:55.757
Used to be we'd get meat
on Wednesdays and Fridays.

24:56.920 --> 24:58.797
Then it was just Wednesdays.

24:59.040 --> 25:03.318
Nazis blame the resistance,
say we're disrupting the food shipment.

25:03.880 --> 25:06.235
- Makes the Germans look like heroes.
- Yeah.

25:06.360 --> 25:07.793
Fighting to feed the people.

25:12.040 --> 25:13.075
Look.

25:15.720 --> 25:17.073
No eye contact.

25:22.440 --> 25:23.839
Why do you walk with her?

25:25.360 --> 25:27.669
- Why not?
- Do you like Negroes?

25:27.920 --> 25:30.593
- We don't want any trouble.
- Shut up, bitch.

25:32.880 --> 25:34.518
Do we make you angry?

25:35.440 --> 25:36.714
You could say that.

25:38.680 --> 25:41.717
When we send her back to Africa,
you can go along.

25:41.840 --> 25:43.876
You can run
through the jungles together.

25:44.120 --> 25:46.793
Like I said,
neighbourhood's gone downhill.

25:48.600 --> 25:49.999
Before he lost consciousness...

25:50.120 --> 25:52.759
Daniels told me
there was someone we had to stop.

25:52.880 --> 25:55.110
At least now we know
who he was talking about.

25:55.320 --> 25:58.676
- Can you get a fix on the shuttlepod?
- He disabled the transponder.

25:59.160 --> 26:01.310
However,
we are picking up trace plasma...

26:01.440 --> 26:03.590
signatures, probably from the damage.

26:04.320 --> 26:06.231
I think I can get us
within three kilometres...

26:06.360 --> 26:07.759
of where it went down.

26:07.880 --> 26:09.313
That will have to suffice.

26:10.120 --> 26:11.678
Thing I can't understand...

26:12.480 --> 26:14.755
why'd he go to the trouble
of saving my life?

26:14.880 --> 26:17.678
He pulled me out of the Launch Bay
before he depressurised it.

26:17.880 --> 26:20.758
Another item on our list of
"Things to ponder."

26:29.600 --> 26:32.114
Curfew starts in an hour.
We got to move fast.

26:32.240 --> 26:34.549
Yeah, sometimes the Germans
don't wait for curfew.

26:35.520 --> 26:37.795
Can't get used
to all this skulking around.

26:37.920 --> 26:39.239
I know what you mean.

26:39.560 --> 26:40.959
We used to own this neighbourhood.

26:41.080 --> 26:43.548
Yeah, tell him what you guys did
before the war.

26:44.400 --> 26:45.674
Nothing to tell.

26:46.240 --> 26:48.595
We were delegates
for the Construction Workers' Union.

26:48.720 --> 26:50.915
Right. The loan sharking
was just a part-time job.

26:51.040 --> 26:53.235
We helped people get out
of financial difficulty.

26:53.360 --> 26:56.352
- Since when is that a crime?
- When they didn't pay you back on time.

26:56.480 --> 26:58.994
- That's where the crime part came in.
- Come on, let's go.

27:03.520 --> 27:04.953
This guy's a welsher and a drunk.

27:05.080 --> 27:07.594
I wouldn't put too much stock
into what comes out of his mouth.

27:07.720 --> 27:08.755
I'll keep that in mind.

27:08.880 --> 27:10.472
I'm only doing this
because Alicia asked.

27:10.600 --> 27:11.669
Don't forget that.

27:13.280 --> 27:14.793
What's this all about?

27:16.280 --> 27:19.317
I want you to tell him what you told me,
about your customer.

27:20.160 --> 27:22.720
- Who are you?
- Just shut up and tell him.

27:22.840 --> 27:25.559
I can't talk and shut up
at the same time.

27:27.960 --> 27:28.949
Talk.

27:30.880 --> 27:32.836
The man comes to me for information.

27:32.960 --> 27:34.871
Sometimes he asks
about the resistance.

27:35.000 --> 27:36.956
Sometimes he asks about the Gestapo.

27:37.400 --> 27:39.595
He's keeping tabs on both sides.

27:40.000 --> 27:43.754
Me? I don't know squat,
so I make stuff up.

27:44.800 --> 27:46.950
- He pays good.
- What's he look like?

27:47.520 --> 27:48.794
He always wears a hat.

27:49.720 --> 27:50.994
Stays in the shadows.

27:52.640 --> 27:54.596
I caught a glimpse of him once.

27:55.040 --> 27:57.793
He ain't like nobody I ever seen,
that's for sure.

27:58.480 --> 28:00.311
It's the red eyes I can't forget.

28:02.560 --> 28:04.232
- I want to talk to him.
- Forget it.

28:04.520 --> 28:06.795
- That ain't part of the deal.
- Sal.

28:11.400 --> 28:14.073
What you owe me, take 20% off.

28:14.280 --> 28:15.838
- Damn, Sal.
- What?

28:16.280 --> 28:18.874
- I'm a generous guy.
- I don't know.

28:19.360 --> 28:22.079
You think the Germans are tough?
Get me in a bad mood.

28:34.040 --> 28:35.075
Artillery.

28:35.240 --> 28:38.357
Hard to believe we're only
a few kilometres from New York City.

28:38.560 --> 28:40.312
It's hard to believe this is Earth.

28:42.440 --> 28:43.839
Plasma signature.

28:44.360 --> 28:45.315
That way.

28:47.080 --> 28:50.550
We're keeping the Germans busy,
more and more of us every day.

28:51.000 --> 28:54.709
Irish gangs, dockworkers,
coloureds, even broads.

28:55.280 --> 28:58.272
Some of these women,
they could shoot the fleas off a tick.

28:58.640 --> 29:01.677
When the war's over, I got half a mind
to put them on the payroll.

29:08.160 --> 29:10.720
Here. It's loaded.

29:16.240 --> 29:17.309
Prazki?

29:29.920 --> 29:32.354
- You.
- Throw the gun down.

29:32.960 --> 29:35.793
You're not following directions.
That's how people get hurt.

29:36.240 --> 29:37.912
You better take her advice.

29:41.640 --> 29:42.834
What do you want?

29:46.000 --> 29:47.558
Holy mother of....

30:19.000 --> 30:20.433
Tucker to Enterprise.

30:20.800 --> 30:22.199
- T'Pol.
- We found it.

30:22.400 --> 30:25.119
- No sign of Silik.
- What's the shuttlepod's condition?

30:25.360 --> 30:27.510
I'll need some more time
before I know if it will fly.

30:28.000 --> 30:29.956
You ever see anything like that before?

30:30.800 --> 30:31.994
Maybe he's wearing some kind of mask.

30:32.120 --> 30:33.314
That's no mask.

30:35.200 --> 30:36.713
Who are you?

30:37.800 --> 30:40.633
- Answer me.
- I have nothing to say to you.

30:40.880 --> 30:42.598
How about if we pulled out your tongue?

30:42.720 --> 30:44.073
You're not what I expected.

30:44.240 --> 30:47.152
Temporal agents
are usually more informed.

30:48.120 --> 30:49.838
What the hell is a "temporal agent"?

30:49.960 --> 30:52.349
- You wouldn't understand.
- Listen, you freak--

30:52.480 --> 30:53.879
Why are you changing history?

30:54.000 --> 30:56.195
You're helping the Germans
win the war. Why?

30:56.320 --> 31:00.233
- Because it suits us.
- How does this suit you?

31:01.440 --> 31:04.193
- Sal, no! Damn it.
- It's better than he deserves.

31:04.320 --> 31:06.629
- Get your hands off him!
- You want answers, don't you?

31:06.760 --> 31:08.557
- Not like that.
- Just say the word, Sal.

31:08.680 --> 31:10.159
I'll take him out right here.

31:11.000 --> 31:12.513
The hell with it.

31:17.400 --> 31:19.118
I don't know how long
I can hold them off.

31:19.240 --> 31:20.355
You better talk to me.

31:21.280 --> 31:23.589
Now who are you?
What are you doing here?

31:23.720 --> 31:24.914
We're trapped.

31:25.080 --> 31:28.516
The Germans are helping us construct
a conduit, so we can find our way home.

31:28.720 --> 31:31.917
- You said I was a temporal agent.
- We know you're from the future.

31:32.160 --> 31:34.116
We detected your ship in orbit.

31:37.320 --> 31:38.275
My ship.

31:38.400 --> 31:41.358
It has the same markings
that were on your uniform.

31:45.160 --> 31:47.993
I need to contact them.
Can I do it with this?

31:52.960 --> 31:54.632
We better get out of here.

31:57.320 --> 31:59.390
The conduit. Where is it being built?

31:59.840 --> 32:01.034
You find it.

32:01.560 --> 32:04.757
Come on.

32:05.120 --> 32:06.473
You won't stop us.

32:06.600 --> 32:09.433
When we get back,
you'll never have existed.

32:26.080 --> 32:28.913
EPS system's completely fused.
It could take a week.

32:29.040 --> 32:31.998
I'm picking up movement in the area.
Looks like several vehicles.

32:32.400 --> 32:34.356
- Commander.
- I heard.

32:34.560 --> 32:36.118
Moving to Plan B.

32:36.560 --> 32:38.835
What about Silik? We got to find him.

32:39.040 --> 32:41.600
We will. One problem at a time.

32:45.000 --> 32:47.275
Jesus,
he looked like some kind of demon.

32:47.400 --> 32:49.356
His blood wasn't even red.

32:49.480 --> 32:52.870
Was that my imagination, or did he say
something about being from the future?

32:53.120 --> 32:54.189
He meant him.

32:54.320 --> 32:55.799
Archer to Enterprise.

32:55.960 --> 32:58.872
You want any more of our help,
you're gonna tell us what's going on.

32:59.000 --> 33:00.319
What was that back there?

33:00.600 --> 33:02.352
That was an extraterrestrial.

33:03.280 --> 33:06.397
- A Martian?
- I don't know what planet he was from.

33:07.160 --> 33:09.628
- Well, where are you from?
- Upstate New York.

33:09.800 --> 33:11.119
Fellas.

33:11.600 --> 33:13.636
A lot of people out past curfew.

33:20.000 --> 33:21.877
I don't like the looks of this.

33:22.880 --> 33:24.757
We got to get out of here.

33:26.000 --> 33:27.194
Move.

33:31.680 --> 33:32.749
Sal!

33:33.520 --> 33:34.669
Get out of here!

34:03.960 --> 34:05.678
Enterprise, come in.

34:09.320 --> 34:11.914
- Enterprise.
- What are you doing?

34:19.480 --> 34:20.754
Enterprise!

34:27.000 --> 34:29.911
Whoever you're calling,
they're not gonna get here in time.

34:31.440 --> 34:32.589
Charges are set.

35:26.720 --> 35:28.597
- It's done.
- I've lost them.

35:28.720 --> 35:31.075
The explosion may have disrupted
their comm signal.

35:31.720 --> 35:33.392
I'm picking up another signal.

35:36.080 --> 35:38.310
- It's faint.
- Let's hear it.

35:38.960 --> 35:41.155
Captain Archer to Enterprise. Come in.

35:42.640 --> 35:44.039
Enterprise, come in.

35:49.280 --> 35:50.315
Captain.

35:52.560 --> 35:55.199
Your transmission is very weak.
Do you read me?

35:57.240 --> 35:59.800
T'Pol. Two to transport.

36:00.240 --> 36:04.153
Leave your weapons on the ground
and stand up slowly.

36:12.720 --> 36:15.109
We have a great deal to talk about.

36:16.240 --> 36:17.832
It will have to wait.

36:27.400 --> 36:29.231
You're all right. You're on my ship.

36:29.560 --> 36:32.120
- How'd we get here?
- It's kind of complicated.

36:33.040 --> 36:35.508
- Promise you won't do that again.
- I promise.

36:41.200 --> 36:42.679
Captain.

36:46.120 --> 36:47.348
Welcome home.

36:47.480 --> 36:50.756
We're not quite home yet,
but it's good to be back.

36:52.040 --> 36:53.871
I guess I have some catching up to do.

36:54.880 --> 36:55.915
Status?

37:00.800 --> 37:03.155
Several vehicles converged
on the area...

37:03.280 --> 37:05.635
moments before
the shuttlepod exploded.

37:06.440 --> 37:07.759
Keep searching.

37:08.560 --> 37:10.835
This is one
of the aliens' communicators.

37:11.120 --> 37:14.556
Take it apart. Figure out how to monitor
their transmissions.

37:20.480 --> 37:22.357
It's nice to see you again, Captain.

37:23.280 --> 37:25.874
I hope it's the last time
you'll have to look after Porthos.

37:26.000 --> 37:27.433
It was a pleasure, as always.

37:29.000 --> 37:31.230
- Is he awake?
- He doesn't have much time.

37:35.960 --> 37:37.188
Jonathan.

37:38.440 --> 37:39.634
Who are they?

37:39.840 --> 37:42.798
The most dangerous faction
of the Cold War.

37:43.680 --> 37:47.116
They're led by Vosk, a fanatic...

37:47.840 --> 37:50.877
violently opposed
to the Temporal Accords.

37:53.440 --> 37:56.000
Stay with me.

37:56.720 --> 37:58.278
We almost captured him.

37:58.720 --> 38:01.439
But he developed a form
of stealth time travel.

38:01.800 --> 38:03.677
He escaped into the past.

38:04.080 --> 38:06.719
We eventually located him,
but it was too late.

38:07.160 --> 38:08.718
He returned to my century.

38:09.600 --> 38:12.194
He and his people defeated us...

38:13.160 --> 38:17.631
and launched this war
that's destroying all of time.

38:18.520 --> 38:22.638
I've sent you to this point because
it's here that Vosk can be stopped.

38:23.320 --> 38:26.790
If you succeed,
the war will never happen.

38:27.520 --> 38:29.829
The timeline will be restored.

38:34.920 --> 38:37.434
One of his people told me
they were building a conduit.

38:37.560 --> 38:40.358
Vosk's time travel device
had a drawback.

38:41.680 --> 38:45.753
It was a one-way trip. He needed
to construct the conduit to get home.

38:46.560 --> 38:49.996
But he was forced to use technology
from this time period.

38:51.120 --> 38:54.669
The machine
would have to be enormous.

38:57.400 --> 38:59.197
Find it. Destroy it.

38:59.800 --> 39:02.553
He must not succeed. Stop him.

39:24.960 --> 39:27.520
Your colleague has managed
to evade us.

39:33.000 --> 39:36.993
I assure you, whatever I want to know,
you will tell me...

39:37.920 --> 39:39.148
gratefully.

39:39.960 --> 39:41.791
I'll be supervising another test.

39:41.920 --> 39:43.797
Notify me
when they're ready for questioning.
