01:39.700 --> 01:41.822
- Put it down here.
- All right. Five bucks.

02:12.147 --> 02:13.475
Taking off already?

02:13.649 --> 02:14.680
Yeah, l gotta get home.

02:14.900 --> 02:17.106
- Dinner with Mom.
- Yeah.

02:17.319 --> 02:19.192
l had a mother once.

02:19.362 --> 02:21.188
Hey, your game's
getting pretty solid, McKay.

02:21.406 --> 02:23.398
Well, thanks. What's the damage?

02:23.616 --> 02:26.901
- Let's see. Three hours, right?
- Yep.

02:27.078 --> 02:28.192
That'll be 1 5 bucks.

02:29.831 --> 02:30.910
You know, McKay,

02:31.123 --> 02:34.741
you're about the last guy who'd ever
struck me as being a mama's boy.

02:37.546 --> 02:41.413
Hey, you hurry back, McKay, huh?
We'll be here.

02:45.387 --> 02:46.881
Dylan, honesty is the key.

02:47.097 --> 02:49.766
You have to tell your mom
how you feel. Get it out on the table.

02:49.933 --> 02:52.139
Forget that psychobabble, Kelly.

02:52.310 --> 02:54.979
That only works
for deep-seated emotional crises.

02:55.146 --> 02:56.308
Parents are another problem.

02:56.522 --> 02:58.099
You tell her
whatever she wants to hear,

02:58.274 --> 02:59.472
and then do what you want.

02:59.692 --> 03:01.020
Parents are oblivious anyway.

03:01.194 --> 03:03.352
lt's not like we all come
from what you'd call

03:03.529 --> 03:05.817
your normal, stable
family backgrounds.

03:06.032 --> 03:09.400
l mean, look what l've been
through with mine, booze and drugs.

03:09.577 --> 03:11.284
Our households
aren't exactly Walsh heaven.

03:11.495 --> 03:13.534
Hey, leave our parents out of this.

03:13.747 --> 03:15.122
We should all be so lucky.

03:16.250 --> 03:19.286
l just can't hang
with a 24-hour live-in mom.

03:19.795 --> 03:21.075
You'll get used to it, pal.

03:21.254 --> 03:23.080
l don't think so.

03:30.179 --> 03:31.423
l'm worried about him.

03:31.931 --> 03:33.757
Come on, Bren.
l've seen him go through worse.

03:33.975 --> 03:35.517
Yeah,
but he's ditched school all week.

03:35.685 --> 03:38.222
- He's been really moody.
- He's always moody.

03:38.437 --> 03:40.595
Besides, moms are supposed
to drive you crazy.

03:40.814 --> 03:43.684
Yeah, well, lris McKay
is certainly doing a good job of that.

03:43.901 --> 03:45.774
- Have you met her yet?
- No.

03:45.986 --> 03:48.311
But l just can't wait.

03:48.530 --> 03:50.072
Three weeks ago,
when school started

03:50.240 --> 03:52.398
and you enrolled
into lntro to Economics,

03:52.617 --> 03:55.190
who thought that some of you
would get so rich so quickly?

03:55.412 --> 03:57.321
Go ahead
and pass these back, please.

03:57.497 --> 04:01.957
Let's see here.
Steve, biotechs are doing very nicely.

04:02.126 --> 04:05.411
Kelly, you caught lBM at the bottom.
Nice.

04:05.588 --> 04:09.585
David, you went out on a limb
with the entertainment issues.

04:09.759 --> 04:11.716
But l must say,
the most well-rounded portfolio,

04:11.886 --> 04:13.925
the one with the highest return,

04:14.096 --> 04:16.337
- is yours, Donna.
- Me?

04:16.557 --> 04:19.427
l had you choose
this imaginary portfolio of stocks

04:19.642 --> 04:22.132
to show you how the stock market
works. But l must say, Donna,

04:22.312 --> 04:24.719
you have a real knack for this.
Your picks are keeping pace

04:24.898 --> 04:27.305
with some of the best mutual funds
in the country.

04:27.525 --> 04:29.564
Well, if anybody can spot a bargain,
Donna can.

04:32.530 --> 04:34.072
Next time.

04:36.534 --> 04:40.578
Guys, guys, guys, why are we
jerking around with make-believe?

04:40.746 --> 04:42.904
- What are you talking about?
- Let's do it for real.

04:43.082 --> 04:45.240
- How real?
- We've all got something stashed.

04:45.417 --> 04:47.290
- Birthday presents, Christmas.
- You're crazy.

04:47.461 --> 04:49.868
My dad lost his shirt
in the stock-market crash of '87.

04:50.047 --> 04:51.624
And l like my shirt, okay?

04:51.798 --> 04:55.629
Yeah. My mom dated a broker once.
My money stays in the bank.

04:55.802 --> 04:57.426
Guys, no guts, no glory.

04:57.596 --> 04:58.971
Show them
what you're made out of.

04:59.139 --> 05:02.056
- Let's take free enterprise for a ride.
- l don't know.

05:02.225 --> 05:03.767
Donna, you're great at this.

05:03.977 --> 05:05.221
lf we'd been playing for real,

05:05.395 --> 05:07.517
we would've made a bundle
off your picks.

05:07.689 --> 05:09.764
Donna, don't be stupid.

05:13.778 --> 05:17.360
Steve's right. You heard Mr. Slater.
l'm good at this.

05:17.573 --> 05:18.687
That was fantasyland.

05:19.199 --> 05:20.574
Well, it doesn't have to be.

05:24.288 --> 05:26.446
So l'm thinking of going blond again.

05:26.623 --> 05:29.908
Or maybe bald, you know,
go for that Sinead look.

05:30.877 --> 05:34.210
- What?
- You haven't heard a word l've said.

05:34.381 --> 05:36.040
l'm sorry, l just--

05:36.216 --> 05:37.674
l got something else on my mind.

05:37.884 --> 05:39.046
Yeah, your mother.

05:39.218 --> 05:40.593
l don't wanna talk about it, Bren.

05:40.762 --> 05:42.553
Well, l do.

05:42.722 --> 05:45.925
Dylan, l can't stand
to see you so miserable.

06:04.284 --> 06:06.193
What is she doing here?

06:06.411 --> 06:07.442
Who?

06:07.620 --> 06:09.197
That's my mother's car.

06:09.414 --> 06:10.908
Here?

06:11.082 --> 06:12.410
Yeah. She's either looking for me

06:12.583 --> 06:15.252
or she's in there
reading your mom's palm.

06:15.419 --> 06:19.001
Well, Bren, looks like you finally
get to meet the mamacita.

06:20.091 --> 06:22.083
You rub your hands like that,

06:22.259 --> 06:25.343
and truly, you can feel
the earth pulsate.

06:26.388 --> 06:28.131
Really.

06:29.182 --> 06:32.016
- Hi.
- Hi.

06:32.185 --> 06:34.889
lris, what are you doing here?

06:35.063 --> 06:37.933
l called looking for you
and Cindy invited me over.

06:38.108 --> 06:41.311
- Hope you don't mind.
- Why should l?

06:41.486 --> 06:44.155
Dylan,
aren't you going to introduce us?

06:44.322 --> 06:48.189
Yeah. Brenda, this is lris.
lris, Brenda.

06:48.367 --> 06:49.861
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you, Brenda.

06:50.036 --> 06:52.158
Actually, l already know
a lot about you.

06:52.371 --> 06:57.032
You're strong-willed, loving
and intensely loyal, aren't you?

06:57.751 --> 07:00.538
Yeah. That's just about right.

07:00.754 --> 07:03.873
But your astrological chart
didn't reveal how pretty you are.

07:04.800 --> 07:06.459
Thanks.

07:06.676 --> 07:09.345
You know, your mom and l
have a lot in common, Dylan.

07:09.512 --> 07:13.889
- You do?
- Oh, yes, we're children of the '60s.

07:14.058 --> 07:16.430
Where have all
the flower children gone?

07:16.602 --> 07:19.768
Gone to power children. Yuppies.

07:21.566 --> 07:24.317
Yeah. Life was a lot simpler

07:24.485 --> 07:27.853
when you could still thumb a ride
anywhere in the world.

07:28.072 --> 07:30.313
Mom, did you hitchhike?

07:30.532 --> 07:32.690
Well, across campus.

07:32.910 --> 07:34.452
Does Dad know?

07:34.620 --> 07:37.193
Those were the days, huh, Bren?

07:37.372 --> 07:39.697
Too bad we missed out
on all the fun.

07:41.876 --> 07:43.951
Listen, Brenda, why don't you
help me set the table?

07:44.129 --> 07:46.666
Dylan and his mom
are staying for dinner.

07:47.590 --> 07:49.416
We are?

07:55.389 --> 07:58.555
One thousand three hundred
thirty-one dollars and fourteen cents.

07:58.726 --> 08:00.635
About to be flushed
right down the drain.

08:00.811 --> 08:03.480
lt's my money, Kelly.
l can do what l want with it.

08:06.024 --> 08:07.222
l'd like to close my account.

08:07.442 --> 08:10.526
- Can l see some lD?
- Oh, sure.

08:13.365 --> 08:15.404
- One moment, please.
- Okay.

08:16.034 --> 08:18.703
Donna, you worked so hard
for this money.

08:18.912 --> 08:21.237
Just think of how long it takes
for a whole year to go by

08:21.414 --> 08:24.699
before you get to another birthday,
and all the bribes for good grades.

08:24.876 --> 08:27.034
And the babysitting money?
Remember how scared you get

08:27.253 --> 08:29.790
being home alone in
somebody else's house late at night?

08:29.964 --> 08:33.082
Donna, don't blow it. And don't
let Steve talk you into this, okay?

08:33.299 --> 08:35.173
How do you want it?

08:36.220 --> 08:39.220
- ln an envelope?
- l meant, big bills, small bills?

08:39.765 --> 08:41.971
Oh, whatever you've got.

08:42.142 --> 08:45.308
Seeing on how she's just planning on
throwing it away anyway.

08:45.478 --> 08:46.936
Why are you trying to ruin this?

08:47.147 --> 08:49.720
Somebody has to.
Donna, you're just being stupid.

08:49.941 --> 08:55.729
One hundred, 200, 300, 400, 500,
600, 700, 800, 900,

08:55.947 --> 09:02.150
1 ,000, 1 00, 200, 300, 20,
$31 and 1 4 cents.

09:02.369 --> 09:03.400
Thank you.

09:03.579 --> 09:05.737
Might as well just go ahead
and give me that 1 4 cents.

09:05.914 --> 09:09.199
Because that's all you're gonna
have left when this thing's over.

09:12.546 --> 09:15.582
l can't believe
how L.A. has changed since l left.

09:15.799 --> 09:17.542
l mean, take Melrose.

09:17.717 --> 09:24.051
ln 1 980, it was all low-rent auto-parts
and hardware stores.

09:24.265 --> 09:27.301
Paved paradise
and put up a parking lot.

09:27.518 --> 09:30.637
Not Hana, though.
That is my little piece of heaven.

09:30.813 --> 09:34.680
- Oh, Maui sounds so beautiful.
- Just tell me when you're ready.

09:34.859 --> 09:38.607
l have a tree house sitting on top
of a pineapple mountain.

09:38.821 --> 09:40.480
Right, Dylan?

09:40.656 --> 09:42.731
lt's paradise.

09:46.995 --> 09:51.573
So, lris,
what did you do for work in Hawaii?

09:52.250 --> 09:54.740
l sold T-shirts on the beach.

09:54.961 --> 09:57.498
And l joined
an archaeological expedition.

09:59.132 --> 10:01.753
But mostly, l just mellowed.

10:02.260 --> 10:03.754
Mellowed?

10:03.928 --> 10:07.261
lt's a great place to drop
your inhibitions, Jim, you know.

10:07.473 --> 10:09.679
Grow a beard. Swim naked.

10:13.979 --> 10:17.347
How alternative.

10:17.566 --> 10:20.685
Oh, come on, Dad, let's do it.
Let's just drop out for a while.

10:20.902 --> 10:23.392
A couple of weeks in Hawaii
doesn't sound bad to me right now.

10:23.571 --> 10:24.851
lt is a magical place.

10:25.031 --> 10:26.904
You should have seen Dylan
when he was there.

10:27.116 --> 10:28.444
lt even mellowed him out.

10:28.660 --> 10:31.945
lt didn't mellow me out.
l was bored out of my gourd.

10:33.581 --> 10:36.118
Cindy, did l tell you
what the psychic told me

10:36.334 --> 10:38.789
- about my son when he was little?
- Please.

10:39.003 --> 10:40.378
Dylan, it's no big deal.

10:40.588 --> 10:42.794
l told you l don't wanna hear it.
Excuse me.

10:43.007 --> 10:44.038
Dylan, wait.

10:44.216 --> 10:45.247
Sweetheart, chill out.

10:45.425 --> 10:48.212
l will, outside.

10:48.637 --> 10:50.296
Excuse me.

10:55.018 --> 10:57.852
That woman
is driving me up the wall, Bren.

10:58.021 --> 11:01.270
Dylan, l'm sure she's not trying to.
She's probably just trying to be a mom.

11:01.441 --> 11:04.560
Well,
l wish she wouldn't try so hard.

11:04.735 --> 11:07.854
Remember a couple of weeks ago
when we went on that camping trip?

11:08.030 --> 11:10.900
You were complaining
that she didn't care enough.

11:11.075 --> 11:12.866
l mean, which is it, Dylan?

11:13.035 --> 11:14.944
l don't know anymore.

11:15.120 --> 11:17.907
Look, just calm down.
l'm sure she means well.

11:18.081 --> 11:21.699
l can't. She's here to stay and there's
not a damn thing l can do about it.

11:21.877 --> 11:24.628
Dylan, it's getting late.

11:25.755 --> 11:28.424
Good little boys have to go
to bed early on a school night.

11:28.591 --> 11:32.458
Thank you so much for dinner,
for everything.

11:32.679 --> 11:36.213
- l feel l've found a real friend.
- Me too.

11:36.390 --> 11:37.932
Good night.

11:40.019 --> 11:43.637
Good night, Brenda.
You are a magical young lady.

11:43.814 --> 11:45.853
Nice meeting you.

11:46.567 --> 11:50.646
- l'll call you later.
- Bye.

11:51.738 --> 11:52.769
l don't know.

11:52.948 --> 11:56.897
l thought she was a little...
Eccentric be the right word?

11:57.077 --> 11:58.654
l think the word is weird.

11:58.828 --> 12:00.405
l don't know, l kind of liked her.

12:00.580 --> 12:03.070
Me too.
Felt like l'd known her for years.

12:03.249 --> 12:05.407
Mom, it must have been
in another life.

12:05.585 --> 12:06.616
Brenda.

12:06.794 --> 12:10.328
No, look, it doesn't matter
what any of us think of lris, anyway.

12:10.506 --> 12:12.664
She's driving Dylan nuts.

12:14.051 --> 12:16.672
Dylan, how long
have you been seeing Brenda?

12:16.887 --> 12:18.131
Why?

12:18.305 --> 12:20.677
Well, you may not notice it,

12:20.891 --> 12:25.018
but she has
an extremely negative aura.

12:25.854 --> 12:27.264
What?

12:27.439 --> 12:28.719
Nothing like Cindy.

12:28.899 --> 12:32.682
ln fact, it's hard to believe
that they are mother and daughter.

12:32.902 --> 12:39.189
Cindy is so spiritual and Brenda is...

12:39.367 --> 12:44.491
Well, such a Scorp.
A Scorpio. You're a Libra.

12:44.664 --> 12:47.997
You are totally wrong for each other.

12:49.460 --> 12:52.496
l don't wanna argue,
so l'm only gonna say this one time.

12:52.671 --> 12:55.244
Brenda Walsh,
my relationship with her,

12:55.424 --> 12:56.503
are none of your business.

12:56.717 --> 12:58.839
Do you understand me?

12:59.886 --> 13:01.878
Well, excuse me.

13:06.101 --> 13:09.600
Where are you going?
lt's almost midnight.

13:09.771 --> 13:11.644
Don't wait up.

13:36.504 --> 13:38.496
- Hey, McKay.
- How you doing?

13:38.673 --> 13:40.215
Bobby Falcone been looking for you.

13:40.425 --> 13:42.500
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

13:42.677 --> 13:45.926
You must be getting pretty good
if Falcone wants to play you.

13:46.097 --> 13:48.172
Well, you know...

13:48.391 --> 13:49.553
Hey, can l get you something?

13:49.725 --> 13:51.551
Yeah, whatever you got on tap
will be fine.

13:51.727 --> 13:54.300
You got it, you got it.

13:56.023 --> 13:58.940
Hey, man, you don't have to
flash that fake lD

13:59.109 --> 14:00.733
every time you come in here,
you know.

14:00.903 --> 14:02.895
- Thanks, man.
- Yeah, no problem.

14:03.071 --> 14:04.814
Hey, you want a shot with that?

14:04.990 --> 14:06.104
Sure, why not?

14:06.283 --> 14:08.026
You got it.

14:20.755 --> 14:23.921
Brandon,
give me that headline again.

14:24.133 --> 14:26.623
''West Beverly swimmers
claim victory.''

14:26.844 --> 14:29.631
Subhead: ''Beverly Hills sinks.''

14:32.266 --> 14:34.175
Okay, got it.

14:35.310 --> 14:37.765
- Great. Slug it in.
- Okay.

14:37.938 --> 14:40.144
Brandon,
what would l do without you?

14:42.108 --> 14:44.147
You guys, l've got to talk to you.

14:44.360 --> 14:46.151
Brenda,
we're about to put the paper to bed.

14:48.656 --> 14:49.900
Okay, what is it?

14:50.116 --> 14:51.195
Dylan has flipped out.

14:51.367 --> 14:53.904
He ditched school again today.
That's the third time this week.

14:54.120 --> 14:56.824
- Where does he go all day?
- l don't know. He won't tell me.

14:57.039 --> 14:59.031
He says his mother
is driving him crazy.

14:59.208 --> 15:01.781
Brenda, it's his problem.

15:02.294 --> 15:04.831
Brenda, there's probably nothing
we can do but listen.

15:05.005 --> 15:06.285
You're already doing that.

15:06.882 --> 15:08.126
Yeah, l guess.

15:09.092 --> 15:10.586
ls his mom really that bad?

15:10.802 --> 15:12.426
- No.
- Yes.

15:12.596 --> 15:14.469
Oh, come on, Brandon.
She's a space case.

15:14.639 --> 15:16.548
- So she's a little flaky.
- A little?

15:16.766 --> 15:18.390
Do you know
what she's doing today?

15:18.560 --> 15:21.644
She took our mother to a mind gym.

15:23.981 --> 15:25.724
A mind gym?

16:17.824 --> 16:20.030
- Hey, Brandon.
- Yeah?

16:20.201 --> 16:22.193
What's with Dylan?
He doesn't look so good.

16:22.412 --> 16:23.740
l don't know.

16:23.913 --> 16:25.407
ls it Brenda again?

16:25.623 --> 16:28.030
No. l think it's his mother.

16:28.584 --> 16:29.615
He's got a mother?

16:29.794 --> 16:32.747
Well, not your
garden-variety, average mom.

16:32.922 --> 16:35.128
But, yeah, sure, he's got one.

16:36.342 --> 16:39.426
When you skip school
three days in a row, l worry about you.

16:39.595 --> 16:42.761
l was just blowing off some steam.
l'll be back tomorrow.

16:42.931 --> 16:44.722
Where were you?

16:44.891 --> 16:47.179
Around.

16:47.352 --> 16:49.510
l'm fine, Bren.

16:49.688 --> 16:52.060
You don't look fine, Dylan.

16:52.816 --> 16:54.725
Here you go, guys.

16:54.901 --> 16:56.181
Dylan, how you doing?

16:56.361 --> 16:58.400
l am fine.

16:58.988 --> 17:01.988
See, he's fine. What'd l tell you?

17:02.825 --> 17:05.861
Dylan, remember, there's a trig test
first period tomorrow.

17:06.036 --> 17:07.067
Already?

17:07.288 --> 17:10.241
lf you wanna study together,
why don't you come over after dinner?

17:10.415 --> 17:12.656
Like around 8, okay?
And l'll get you through it.

17:12.835 --> 17:14.412
Sure.

17:15.127 --> 17:17.037
Listen, l gotta go.

17:17.255 --> 17:18.416
Dylan, wait a second.

17:18.589 --> 17:20.214
What?

17:20.675 --> 17:22.085
Are you sure you're okay?

17:23.678 --> 17:24.757
Bye, Bren.

17:38.734 --> 17:39.978
Good?

17:40.152 --> 17:42.477
l feel like l'm floating.

17:43.572 --> 17:47.403
Now, this is my favourite.

17:47.576 --> 17:50.149
Ginger, garlic, orange. Thanks.

17:50.328 --> 17:51.656
Sounds strong.

17:51.830 --> 17:53.573
Try it.

17:54.457 --> 17:57.244
You get a real rush from the garlic.

18:00.338 --> 18:02.211
l'll say.

18:02.590 --> 18:04.712
Natural high.

18:05.760 --> 18:10.338
So how long before the bliss fades
and l turn back into a mom?

18:10.806 --> 18:14.637
l guarantee it'll last
at least through dinner.

18:14.810 --> 18:16.601
Do you come here a lot?

18:17.604 --> 18:21.648
Once, twice a week.
l just get so fried.

18:23.902 --> 18:25.526
Tell me the truth.

18:25.695 --> 18:28.150
Do your kids actually talk to you?

18:29.199 --> 18:32.698
Brenda and Brandon?
Most of the time, l can't shut them up.

18:33.369 --> 18:39.038
Well, Dylan takes after his father,
you know?

18:40.126 --> 18:42.747
Dylan's had a tough time of it lately.

18:42.920 --> 18:45.078
Well, l don't need to tell you.

18:45.256 --> 18:47.462
Maybe you do.

18:47.633 --> 18:49.542
You probably know him
better than l do.

18:49.760 --> 18:51.004
No, l didn't mean that.

18:51.178 --> 18:53.004
No, l know, l know.

18:53.221 --> 18:55.972
l appreciate your friendship.

18:56.141 --> 18:58.180
You know, from what l remembered
of Beverly Hills,

18:58.351 --> 19:04.519
l expected to be treated like a pariah
for having walked out on my son.

19:05.775 --> 19:07.518
l'm not judging you, lris.

19:07.735 --> 19:09.478
l know.

19:10.112 --> 19:13.480
Well, let me tell you,
it's not what you think.

19:13.657 --> 19:15.199
No.

19:17.703 --> 19:20.739
l can't erase the past.

19:20.914 --> 19:24.117
But maybe l can do something
about the future.

19:36.095 --> 19:38.882
Yes, l think we'll start
with the beluga caviar and the blini.

19:39.057 --> 19:42.472
And, l don't know, Donna, how does
the Chateaubriand sound to you?

19:42.643 --> 19:43.674
- Perfect.
- Great.

19:43.853 --> 19:45.726
And, of course,
a bottle of your best champagne.

19:45.938 --> 19:47.977
- What's with you guys?
- We're rich.

19:48.190 --> 19:50.859
Right. Three days ago we bought
some stock and it went up.

19:51.026 --> 19:55.403
Up? lt went through the roof!
lt exploded!

19:55.572 --> 19:58.608
Steve, that's just the paper profits.
To make some money, we need to sell.

19:58.784 --> 20:01.357
Sell? Sell? Donna,
haven't you ever heard of equity?

20:01.536 --> 20:03.824
Give yourself some credit.
You're a genius, Donna.

20:03.997 --> 20:08.124
She may look like a dumb blond,
but she's the wizard of Wall Street.

20:21.931 --> 20:23.045
Winners?

20:24.767 --> 20:26.225
Mr. Falcone.

20:28.604 --> 20:32.518
Nine ball. Over there.

20:38.113 --> 20:39.393
l just won.

20:41.741 --> 20:44.575
So the prince of Beverly Hills
wants to lose some money, huh?

20:45.328 --> 20:46.822
lf you say so.

20:47.038 --> 20:48.318
How's 50 a game sound?

20:48.497 --> 20:49.611
Sounds good.

20:49.790 --> 20:50.821
Lag for break?

20:51.041 --> 20:52.239
After you.

20:55.838 --> 20:58.328
What is this?
lt is so spicy, l can't even eat it.

20:58.507 --> 21:01.044
lt's a place that Dylan's mother
recommended in West Hollywood

21:01.218 --> 21:02.416
called Pakistani Palace.

21:02.636 --> 21:06.087
- lt is a little hot.
- Oh, Jim, it's not hot. lt's invigorating.

21:06.264 --> 21:08.754
l'm beginning to see stars.
Could you pass the water, please?

21:08.975 --> 21:11.133
Now lris has you going off
the deep end, doesn't she?

21:11.311 --> 21:14.726
Now, Brenda, there's nothing wrong
with trying something new.

21:14.897 --> 21:17.897
You know, if she's such a free spirit,
why can't she lighten up on Dylan?

21:18.109 --> 21:19.651
Because she's his mother.

21:19.819 --> 21:22.488
And whether he likes it or not,
he's her responsibility.

21:22.655 --> 21:25.655
From what she's been telling me,
he hasn't made it easy for her either.

21:26.325 --> 21:27.735
Well, maybe not.

21:27.910 --> 21:29.985
But she's got Dylan
wound up like a spring.

21:30.162 --> 21:32.617
l mean, if she doesn't back off,
he's gonna snap.

22:17.207 --> 22:18.451
Guess that's an ace.

22:19.042 --> 22:21.449
Yeah. Pretty good.

22:21.627 --> 22:24.627
Well, that's it for me tonight,
rich kid.

22:25.548 --> 22:27.789
Anytime, Falcone, anytime.

22:48.278 --> 22:49.855
Brenda?

22:50.029 --> 22:51.606
lt's okay, Mom. lt's just Dylan.

22:52.448 --> 22:55.117
Do you know what time it is?
You were supposed to be here at 8:00.

22:55.326 --> 22:56.524
l'm sorry, Bren. Forgive me.

22:57.161 --> 22:58.275
You've been drinking.

22:59.288 --> 23:00.568
l'm a big boy.

23:03.584 --> 23:05.541
ls this what you meant by
''blowing off steam''?

23:05.711 --> 23:08.581
Oh, lighten up, Bren.
l'm under control.

23:08.755 --> 23:11.589
No, you're not, Dylan. Look at you.

23:12.092 --> 23:14.713
So where do your parents
keep the liquid?

23:14.886 --> 23:17.756
Are you crazy?
My parents will hear you.

23:17.931 --> 23:19.722
l'm sorry.

23:20.725 --> 23:22.800
What, no Scotch?

23:26.439 --> 23:27.814
l just want a shot.

23:27.982 --> 23:29.310
Dylan, don't do this.

23:30.318 --> 23:32.808
Brenda, l already have
one woman in my life

23:32.987 --> 23:35.608
who thinks she's my mother, okay?

23:35.823 --> 23:39.441
Damn it, Dylan, if you are going
to drink, get the hell out of my house.

23:46.833 --> 23:48.955
l thought l could count on you.

23:49.127 --> 23:51.249
Thanks for listening.

24:13.275 --> 24:18.150
Brandon, that was Dylan downstairs.
He was drunk.

24:21.658 --> 24:23.449
Oh, no.

24:24.369 --> 24:28.033
He got into the liquor cabinet,
and l threw him out.

24:28.206 --> 24:30.827
- Did l screw up?
- No.

24:31.334 --> 24:34.085
He's been clean for so long.

24:36.130 --> 24:38.039
Not exactly.

24:39.216 --> 24:40.793
What do you mean?

24:41.510 --> 24:43.965
lt was on the camping trip,
l didn't wanna tell you.

24:44.138 --> 24:45.169
What?

24:45.389 --> 24:47.547
lt was just a couple
little airline bottles of booze.

24:47.724 --> 24:49.383
l didn't wanna make a big deal of it.

24:49.559 --> 24:52.762
Brandon, it is a big deal.
Dylan's a recovering alcoholic.

24:52.979 --> 24:55.185
Yes, l'm aware of that,
Brenda, thank you.

24:55.398 --> 24:57.604
lt's his mother's fault.
She's driving him crazy.

24:57.817 --> 25:00.354
You think his mother's
driving him to drink, Bren? Come on.

25:00.570 --> 25:03.191
Life's a little more complicated.
You and l don't go get drunk

25:03.364 --> 25:05.190
every time we have
a fight with Mom and Dad.

25:05.408 --> 25:07.815
Yeah, well, he was fine
until she got here.

25:07.993 --> 25:09.107
Maybe.

25:09.703 --> 25:12.656
But she's not the one
pouring booze down his throat.

25:24.551 --> 25:26.377
At some point
in every investor's experience

25:26.553 --> 25:27.632
comes a moment of truth.

25:27.804 --> 25:29.511
You've made some money
on a stock.

25:29.722 --> 25:31.595
Do you sell or do you hold?

25:31.808 --> 25:34.559
Steve, it's time to unload.

25:34.727 --> 25:36.269
What are you, crazy?
We're on a roll.

25:36.479 --> 25:38.436
We tripled our money. Let's get out.

25:38.648 --> 25:42.859
Donna, perhaps you'd like to
share this with the rest of us?

25:43.027 --> 25:44.936
l don't think so.

25:45.154 --> 25:47.111
Why not? She's the big expert.

25:48.740 --> 25:50.115
Okay.

25:50.284 --> 25:54.233
l just don't think that when someone
buys stock, they should get greedy.

25:54.663 --> 25:57.533
You make a profit, you get out.

25:58.124 --> 25:59.155
Steve?

25:59.334 --> 26:02.251
Well, what if you get out too soon
and miss out on a major jump?

26:02.420 --> 26:03.878
Well, it's like the song says:

26:04.088 --> 26:06.578
''You gotta know when to hold them,
know when to fold them.''

26:06.758 --> 26:07.789
You're out of here.

26:10.428 --> 26:12.503
- You're wimping out on me.
- l am not.

26:12.680 --> 26:14.589
l'm taking a profit. An honest profit.

26:14.765 --> 26:16.140
- Yeah?
- lt's the way of the game.

26:16.308 --> 26:17.387
Well, Bernie says hold out.

26:17.559 --> 26:20.678
He says the major players are trying
to scare out the little people like us.

26:20.854 --> 26:22.561
And they're gonna push it
through the roof.

26:22.731 --> 26:23.810
- You called Bernie?
- Yeah.

26:23.982 --> 26:26.472
And frankly, when Bernie Goldfinger
talks, l listen, Donna.

26:26.651 --> 26:28.524
Well, what if he's wrong?

26:28.695 --> 26:30.189
Don't be stupid.

26:30.363 --> 26:33.862
Bernie's an expert. We're not selling.

26:42.250 --> 26:43.364
Morning, all.

26:43.542 --> 26:47.076
Oh, you decided to come to school.
To what do we owe the honour?

26:47.254 --> 26:48.997
Good morning.

26:49.214 --> 26:51.206
l'm sorry about last night.

26:51.383 --> 26:54.134
- Dylan, you've been drinking.
- Bren, would l come to school drunk?

26:54.636 --> 26:56.842
You smell like a brewery.
l better get you out of here.

26:57.055 --> 27:00.969
Man, hey, l'm fine.
Besides, l got a trig test.

27:01.184 --> 27:02.594
Oh, l'm sure you'll ace that one.

27:02.811 --> 27:04.091
Oh, shut up, Kelly.

27:04.312 --> 27:07.478
You know, there's one thing worse
than a drunk, that's a mean drunk.

27:07.690 --> 27:10.015
l suddenly have the urge
to just get the hell out of here.

27:10.193 --> 27:12.944
So why don't you
give my regards to trig?

27:14.363 --> 27:16.688
Dylan. Brandon,
you've gotta do something.

27:16.866 --> 27:20.115
Look, it's his problem.
Just don't get sucked in, all right?

27:20.327 --> 27:23.161
l don't care.
Brandon, you can't let him drink.

27:23.706 --> 27:25.615
l'll do what l can.

27:27.751 --> 27:29.873
Brenda,
you're making a big mistake.

27:30.045 --> 27:31.669
Dylan is gonna do
what he's gonna do.

27:31.838 --> 27:33.545
But l can't stand by and let him do it.

27:33.715 --> 27:34.995
Bren, he's an alcoholic.

27:35.175 --> 27:36.289
l know that, Kelly.

27:36.468 --> 27:38.045
Do you know what that means?

27:38.219 --> 27:40.923
Look, l love him so much.
l can't stand to see him get hurt.

27:41.097 --> 27:42.341
l know, it's hard.

27:42.515 --> 27:44.756
But just trust me,
you have to let him hit bottom.

27:44.934 --> 27:47.555
What does that mean, hit bottom?
l mean, that sounds so final.

27:47.770 --> 27:49.477
Brenda,
you just have to have some faith.

27:49.647 --> 27:52.896
lt wasn't easy watching my mom
degrade herself night after night.

27:53.108 --> 27:55.433
When she was drunk,
l wanted to kill her.

27:55.611 --> 27:57.484
When she was sick,
it tore my heart out.

27:57.696 --> 28:00.732
But l learned that l just had to
let her go through it by herself.

28:00.907 --> 28:02.982
Because the more l tried to help,
the worse it got.

28:04.202 --> 28:07.368
You know why?
Because l was there.

28:07.539 --> 28:10.160
And as long as l was there,
she knew she could keep on drinking

28:10.333 --> 28:13.084
and l'd be there
to pick up the pieces.

28:13.253 --> 28:15.541
Bren, you can love him,
but you can't save him.

28:25.306 --> 28:26.848
Can't let you drive, pal.

28:28.684 --> 28:29.882
l'm fine.

28:30.102 --> 28:32.390
Anywhere you wanna go,
l'll take you.

28:32.562 --> 28:34.934
l just don't wanna scrape you
off a telephone pole today.

28:35.107 --> 28:37.229
lt's this thing l got against it,
you know.

28:38.235 --> 28:39.314
Anywhere?

28:39.527 --> 28:40.771
Anywhere.

28:56.710 --> 28:58.583
Your friend's pretty good.

28:58.754 --> 29:01.126
He took a lot of money
off me yesterday.

29:01.298 --> 29:02.840
Really, how much?

29:03.008 --> 29:04.751
Five hundred.

29:04.927 --> 29:06.718
Dollars?

29:07.387 --> 29:10.423
Don't worry, kid.
l already won it back.

29:18.648 --> 29:19.762
Your shot, man.

29:25.946 --> 29:27.404
Haven't you had
enough of this, man?

29:27.573 --> 29:30.490
- We've been here all day.
- l can't walk out on this game, Bran.

29:30.659 --> 29:32.984
l'm hot, never been this hot.
l'm gonna wipe this guy out.

29:33.203 --> 29:35.907
What are you talking about?
You lost 500 bucks already.

29:36.123 --> 29:37.321
That was his money.

29:37.499 --> 29:38.909
Dylan, you're not making sense.

29:39.126 --> 29:41.913
This guy's playing you for a chump.
How long you gonna keep this up?

29:42.128 --> 29:43.670
Till l'm numb.

29:43.838 --> 29:47.965
Till l forget where l am and why
l came here in the first place, all right?

29:55.183 --> 29:56.262
What do l do?

29:57.685 --> 30:00.472
Should l call the police, hospitals?

30:00.646 --> 30:04.773
He's not at the library,
he's not at that Peach Pit place.

30:04.942 --> 30:07.432
Look, lris,
l know what you're going through.

30:07.611 --> 30:08.986
l mean, l can never get to sleep

30:09.154 --> 30:12.522
until the two of them
are safe in their beds and asleep.

30:12.991 --> 30:15.825
But it's only 1 0:30.

30:16.036 --> 30:20.662
l know, but l think
he's drinking, Cindy.

30:21.165 --> 30:24.414
Sometimes he doesn't get in
till 2, 3 in the morning.

30:24.585 --> 30:27.585
Well, now, if this has been going on
for some time,

30:27.755 --> 30:29.165
why are you so worried tonight?

30:29.382 --> 30:31.919
Because last night,
he didn't come home at all.

30:33.969 --> 30:36.506
You know, Brenda said
everybody was going to the movies.

30:36.680 --> 30:37.842
He's probably with them.

30:38.057 --> 30:40.298
Well, then why didn't he call?

30:40.475 --> 30:44.057
l don't know how much longer l can
take this. This isn't working, Cindy.

30:44.229 --> 30:46.387
l don't know how to do this.

30:46.606 --> 30:48.598
But you don't have much choice,
do you?

30:48.775 --> 30:50.933
l mean, you're his mother.

30:52.904 --> 30:54.943
Well, that's easier said than done.

30:59.827 --> 31:01.570
- Hi.
- lsn't Brandon with you?

31:01.746 --> 31:03.453
- Where's Dylan?
- l don't know.

31:03.622 --> 31:05.780
- Oh, my God.
- Why, what's wrong?

31:06.000 --> 31:08.372
l am calling the police
and the hospitals.

31:08.544 --> 31:10.619
Would somebody first
please tell me what's going on?

31:10.838 --> 31:12.118
Has Dylan been drinking?

31:14.716 --> 31:18.131
Yes. But Brandon made sure
he didn't drive.

31:18.303 --> 31:20.544
Well, maybe he should have
made sure he didn't drink.

31:20.722 --> 31:22.844
Where do you get off
criticizing Brandon?

31:23.058 --> 31:25.430
He has been there for Dylan
whenever Dylan needed him,

31:25.602 --> 31:27.345
which is a lot more
than l can say for you.

31:27.562 --> 31:28.842
Brenda.

31:29.022 --> 31:30.599
Sorry, Mom, it is true.

31:30.815 --> 31:33.021
Why else do you think
Dylan's falling apart?

31:33.234 --> 31:34.941
Brandon is with him?

31:35.444 --> 31:36.986
Yes.

31:37.154 --> 31:39.941
Okay. lf he's with Brandon,
then he's fine.

31:47.789 --> 31:50.955
Well, that's it, rich kid. l'm done.

31:52.502 --> 31:55.502
Hey, man, you gotta give me
a chance to get even here.

31:56.506 --> 31:58.878
No, l don't gotta do anything.

31:59.050 --> 32:01.884
l said l'm done, l'm done.
Pay up.

32:04.889 --> 32:07.676
Funny, l don't see you
reaching into your pocket.

32:07.850 --> 32:09.557
That's because l don't have it.

32:12.646 --> 32:14.804
You play pool, you carry cash.

32:15.023 --> 32:17.560
l told you when we started
that l don't take any lOUs.

32:18.235 --> 32:21.354
Well, then l guess
you don't get paid.

32:21.571 --> 32:24.405
- He'll get it, man. He's good for it.
- Brandon, stay out of it.

32:29.496 --> 32:32.864
You wanna go for a walk?
ls that what you're saying to me?

32:35.585 --> 32:37.577
Come on, man.

32:47.721 --> 32:49.345
Come on, man, he's had enough.

32:51.600 --> 32:54.351
That was just to let you know
that l'm serious.

32:54.853 --> 32:58.802
lt's the next time that l get mean.
So don't mess with me.

32:59.315 --> 33:02.315
Bring cash tomorrow.

33:08.616 --> 33:09.647
Let's go.

33:20.169 --> 33:23.169
Dylan. Dylan, you okay, pal?
You all right?

33:23.338 --> 33:24.962
Yeah.

33:25.132 --> 33:27.457
Come on, let's get out of here.

33:45.067 --> 33:46.311
Where have you been?

33:46.527 --> 33:48.852
Brandon, it's a school night.
Do you know what time it is?

33:49.029 --> 33:51.104
- What are you doing here?
- l've been worried sick.

33:51.281 --> 33:53.024
- Oh, please, spare me.
- Brandon.

33:53.200 --> 33:54.658
Sorry. We lost track of the time.

33:54.868 --> 33:57.240
You lost track of the time?
lt's almost 1 :00.

33:57.454 --> 33:59.327
- Where were you?
- Hanging out.

33:59.539 --> 34:01.448
We were at a pool hall.
l got in a game.

34:01.625 --> 34:04.791
lt's like Brandon said,
we lost track of time.

34:05.295 --> 34:06.457
Oh, my God.

34:06.671 --> 34:08.330
Do you always get a fat lip
when you play?

34:08.547 --> 34:10.090
- l lost some money.
- How much?

34:10.299 --> 34:12.420
- Eight hundred dollars.
- l can't handle this.

34:12.635 --> 34:15.208
You never could handle anything,
could you?

34:15.388 --> 34:17.130
Don't you speak to me like that.

34:17.806 --> 34:20.476
l do not deserve
to be spoken to in that way.

34:20.684 --> 34:22.641
Well, how should l speak to you?
With respect?

34:22.853 --> 34:25.389
Or like someone who walked out
on me when l was 6 years old?

34:27.357 --> 34:29.266
l'm sorry.
Would you excuse us for a minute?

34:29.443 --> 34:31.234
l need to talk to my son.

34:33.154 --> 34:36.402
Brenda, come on.
Everybody, into the kitchen.

34:37.659 --> 34:39.402
All right, are you involved in this?

34:39.577 --> 34:42.150
No, Dad. l was just trying to help him
cool out a little bit.

34:42.330 --> 34:44.405
- l did the best job l could.
- Oh, Dylan.

34:44.581 --> 34:46.739
l think the time for feeling sorry
for Dylan is over.

34:46.918 --> 34:47.949
l know.

34:48.127 --> 34:49.158
How can you say that?

34:49.335 --> 34:51.043
Brenda,
the kind of problems that Dylan has

34:51.213 --> 34:53.039
take a long time to build up.

34:53.215 --> 34:54.873
Now, we've all been there for him.

34:55.050 --> 34:56.922
But there's only so much
that any of us can do.

34:57.261 --> 34:59.052
You're abandoning him.

34:59.221 --> 35:01.676
You said that you would stand by him,
that you'd help him.

35:01.890 --> 35:03.088
Brenda, he has a mother now.

35:03.308 --> 35:04.339
Yeah, that's the trouble.

35:04.518 --> 35:06.973
Then he's gonna have to
work it out with her.

35:07.145 --> 35:10.763
And, Brenda, until Dylan shows
he can get a grip on his life,

35:10.940 --> 35:12.268
l don't want you seeing him.

35:13.192 --> 35:14.983
Do you understand?

35:22.993 --> 35:25.400
Dylan, l admit it,
l don't know what to do.

35:25.579 --> 35:27.785
l do not know how to handle you.

35:27.956 --> 35:30.446
l'm not your problem.

35:30.626 --> 35:32.120
You're my responsibility.

35:32.336 --> 35:34.411
Really? Since when?

35:35.505 --> 35:37.830
lf you're trying to hurt me...

35:39.843 --> 35:41.041
...you're succeeding.

35:41.219 --> 35:42.594
Tell me why.

35:42.804 --> 35:45.294
Why should l all of a sudden
start listening to you?

35:45.515 --> 35:48.266
Because l am your mother
and l love you.

35:48.476 --> 35:50.682
Oh, please,
let's not bring love into this.

35:51.896 --> 35:53.438
Dylan.

35:55.232 --> 35:56.263
Dylan!

36:08.578 --> 36:11.365
Oh, this is ridiculous.

36:11.539 --> 36:15.073
l don't know how to be a mother.

36:15.543 --> 36:19.492
lris, it's not something
you can figure out in just one month.

36:20.339 --> 36:23.375
l've been working at it
full-time for over 1 6 years.

36:23.551 --> 36:25.673
When Jack was arrested,
l thought to myself,

36:25.845 --> 36:27.339
finally, l get my son back.

36:27.513 --> 36:30.430
l thought l'll just move right on in.

36:30.599 --> 36:33.054
Oh, God, what a fool.

36:33.227 --> 36:35.266
Oh, lris, don't say that.

36:35.437 --> 36:37.892
He needs you,
whether he realizes it or not.

36:39.149 --> 36:43.016
Cindy, that is a beautiful platitude,
but let's not kid ourselves.

36:43.194 --> 36:46.064
l walked out on my son.

36:46.656 --> 36:49.740
Why should l expect him
ever to forgive me for that?

36:50.868 --> 36:53.619
Or even want to understand why?

36:53.788 --> 36:55.447
He's right.

36:56.666 --> 36:59.785
l don't deserve
to be a part of his life.

37:04.590 --> 37:10.176
Dylan, my father says l can't see you
until you get your life together.

37:10.345 --> 37:13.927
Yeah, well, he's probably right.

37:14.641 --> 37:19.302
l don't wanna lose you, Dylan.
Not this time.

37:20.271 --> 37:24.268
l'll be all right, Bren. Promise.

37:36.537 --> 37:38.031
Hey!

37:38.956 --> 37:41.411
Hey, did you see this?

37:42.250 --> 37:43.364
- Did you see this?
- What?

37:43.585 --> 37:45.660
Well, that wonderful company
you picked for us

37:45.837 --> 37:48.374
to invest our life savings in
is having a little problem.

37:48.548 --> 37:49.579
What's wrong?

37:49.758 --> 37:53.589
Well, it says that L.A. Sharp's shoe
factory in Korea burned to the ground.

37:53.803 --> 37:54.965
We're gonna lose everything.

37:55.138 --> 37:57.011
Why do l listen to you
and your stupid ideas?

37:57.223 --> 37:59.381
Well, maybe you should have
listened to me.

37:59.559 --> 38:02.228
- What's that supposed to mean?
- l told you we should have sold.

38:02.395 --> 38:04.850
But no, you had to go and be greedy,
Mr. Big Shot.

38:06.232 --> 38:09.268
- So say it, l told you so.
- l told you so.

38:09.485 --> 38:11.311
Great, 20/20 hindsight.

38:12.404 --> 38:15.607
Well, it's not exactly hindsight.

38:16.825 --> 38:17.904
What's that mean?

38:18.410 --> 38:19.738
l sold.

38:21.037 --> 38:23.278
- You what?
- Yeah, yesterday.

38:23.498 --> 38:25.739
Right after you called me
a stupid wimp, right?

38:26.626 --> 38:28.168
- You did not.
- l did.

38:28.378 --> 38:30.666
And l made a lot of money
and l'm not stupid.

38:30.838 --> 38:33.044
And don't either of you
ever call me stupid again.

38:33.215 --> 38:35.124
Thank you.

38:38.262 --> 38:42.176
l think we ought to get her to pick us
another stock. What do you say, Kel?

38:42.349 --> 38:44.092
l'm in.

38:59.782 --> 39:01.026
What time is it?

39:01.200 --> 39:04.568
Noon. Made you breakfast.

39:04.912 --> 39:08.031
Real food. Thanks.

39:09.875 --> 39:12.626
Dylan, the things you said
last night--

39:12.836 --> 39:16.500
l'm sorry. l was just a little out of it.

39:16.673 --> 39:18.464
But you were right.

39:18.675 --> 39:21.509
l thought l could come here, that...

39:22.095 --> 39:24.799
That l could make up
for all those lost years.

39:25.015 --> 39:26.924
l can't.

39:30.395 --> 39:32.352
So where does that leave us?

39:34.732 --> 39:36.724
Dylan, l'm here for you.

39:36.901 --> 39:44.611
But you don't need a full-time mom
any more than l know how to be one.

39:46.035 --> 39:47.861
You've been on your own
for a while.

39:48.036 --> 39:53.789
And from what Cindy Walsh tells me,
you take pretty good care of yourself.

39:53.959 --> 39:56.200
Well, that's when you don't have
a mother around

39:56.378 --> 39:57.788
to throw a wrench in the works.

39:57.962 --> 39:59.919
Maybe l didn't give you a chance.

40:01.132 --> 40:02.791
No.

40:04.927 --> 40:11.095
But the best thing that l can do for you
is to give you your freedom.

40:15.688 --> 40:17.763
l'm gonna go back to Hawaii.

40:18.315 --> 40:19.394
What?

40:19.566 --> 40:23.100
l know that some people may say
that l'm copping out.

40:23.278 --> 40:25.566
That things got a little rough
and l split.

40:25.739 --> 40:29.736
But the truth is, Dylan,

40:29.909 --> 40:34.286
l wasn't there for you 1 1 years ago
when you really needed me.

40:34.455 --> 40:38.073
So l'm not gonna pretend

40:38.251 --> 40:41.454
to be here for you now
when you don't.

40:43.130 --> 40:45.205
When we split up,

40:46.300 --> 40:50.795
your father offered me a lot of money
to keep out of your life.

40:52.639 --> 40:55.260
lf l'd been stronger,

40:55.434 --> 40:57.806
l might have fought him
harder and longer

40:57.978 --> 40:59.306
and l might have won.

41:00.105 --> 41:04.102
But we'll never know,

41:04.692 --> 41:06.565
because l gave up.

41:06.778 --> 41:09.944
l took his money and l disappeared.

41:11.908 --> 41:13.236
But l promised myself

41:13.409 --> 41:17.358
that l would never,
ever touch a penny of it.

41:17.538 --> 41:19.447
And l didn't.

41:19.665 --> 41:21.123
So...

41:23.919 --> 41:26.125
This belongs to you.

41:31.968 --> 41:33.166
That's a lot of money.

41:33.386 --> 41:34.880
Yeah.

41:35.388 --> 41:37.179
lt's yours.

41:37.348 --> 41:39.257
l don't want it.

41:40.935 --> 41:43.472
l've asked Jim Walsh
to set up a trust.

41:43.980 --> 41:46.684
That way, you won't blow it
all at once.

41:49.443 --> 41:52.443
Make a good life for yourself, baby.

41:52.613 --> 41:53.988
What about you?

41:54.198 --> 41:55.360
Oh, don't worry about me.

41:55.532 --> 41:59.114
l've got a tree house
on a pineapple mountain, remember?

42:02.289 --> 42:04.495
What l do want

42:05.458 --> 42:08.375
is for us to start again.

42:09.587 --> 42:14.129
To build a relationship
based on something real.

42:17.053 --> 42:20.006
That way, maybe sometime,

42:20.681 --> 42:23.847
you won't wanna call me lris.

42:24.727 --> 42:27.134
You'll wanna call me Mom.

42:37.656 --> 42:39.897
Dylan's in the car.
We're on our way to the airport.

42:40.075 --> 42:41.617
l just wanted to say goodbye.

42:41.785 --> 42:45.782
And thanks. To all of you.

42:50.084 --> 42:51.875
Good luck, lris.

42:52.044 --> 42:56.752
You take care of my son.

42:59.051 --> 43:00.082
We will.

43:00.803 --> 43:02.380
lris.

43:03.347 --> 43:04.924
l'm sorry for what l said to you.

43:05.682 --> 43:06.761
l understand.

43:06.975 --> 43:09.548
l know it must take a lot of courage
to do what you're doing.

43:11.688 --> 43:13.976
He's not an easy guy to love, is he?

43:14.858 --> 43:16.316
No.

43:17.110 --> 43:18.652
But we sure do, don't we?

43:21.322 --> 43:25.533
Yes. We sure do.

43:31.832 --> 43:33.491
How you doing, pal?

43:33.667 --> 43:35.825
Okay, l guess.

43:36.003 --> 43:38.291
l can't believe she's leaving.

43:38.463 --> 43:40.621
l couldn't put up with her,

43:40.799 --> 43:42.874
but l don't really wanna be
alone again either.

43:43.093 --> 43:44.635
Yeah, well, you're not alone.

43:45.178 --> 43:47.715
l'm what they call
an emancipated minor.

43:49.641 --> 43:52.428
Listen, when you get back
from the airport, give me a call.

43:52.602 --> 43:53.977
There's someplace we gotta go.

43:54.186 --> 43:57.270
Yeah, l know. Falcone.

43:57.440 --> 43:59.147
After that.

43:59.316 --> 44:00.395
Where?

44:01.569 --> 44:03.941
Someplace you took me
when l needed a friend.

44:11.203 --> 44:16.872
God grant me the serenity
to accept the things l cannot change,

44:17.042 --> 44:19.876
the courage to change
the things l can,

44:20.044 --> 44:23.247
and the wisdom
to know the difference.
