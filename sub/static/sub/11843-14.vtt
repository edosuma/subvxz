<i>Previously on Roswe“.</i>

00:02.769 --> 00:04.999
Sometimes you have to take a step back
to see what's going on.

00:05.071 --> 00:08.666
<i>And I can't keep pretending
that I'm normal.</i>

00:08.742 --> 00:11.712
Max, I know you think that-
that we shouldn't be together...

00:11.778 --> 00:15.078
and maybe you're right,
but you made me a part of this.

00:15.148 --> 00:19.847
- [ Max] What does this mean?
- That he's back. Nasedds here.

00:19.919 --> 00:25.414
This guy's been leaving carnage
all over the Southwest for the past 4O years.

00:25.492 --> 00:28.462
I think the one we've been
looking for has killed people.

00:28.528 --> 00:30.862
A lot of people.

00:30.863 --> 00:31.056
A lot of people.

00:36.568 --> 00:39.560
Oh, man, am I gonna kick some ass
at these auditions.

00:39.638 --> 00:41.572
Do you guys sound
as good plugged in?

00:41.640 --> 00:46.202
Just you wait, little ladies,
until you see my band open up at the...

00:46.278 --> 00:48.440
you know, the blind date
concert this Friday.

00:48.513 --> 00:50.311
You know, you need
a better name.

00:50.382 --> 00:52.407
Oh, come on.
What's wrong with the Whits?

00:52.484 --> 00:54.885
Just an “S“ away
from what you really are.

00:54.953 --> 00:58.218
- [Chuckles] That's funny. That's funny.
- [Dee/lay on Radio Chatterrhg]

00:58.290 --> 00:59.724
Ooh! Shush.

00:59.791 --> 01:03.421
To the winner of the KROZ
blind valentine dream date.

01:06.865 --> 01:08.833
in the most exciting concert
of the year.

01:08.901 --> 01:12.462
An intimate club date with a mystery band
that'll put this town on the map-

01:12.537 --> 01:15.438
This is so stupid.
Like anyone would want to go out...

01:15.507 --> 01:17.669
with someone a radio station
picks out for you.

01:17.743 --> 01:20.337
- No, I thought it was romantic.
- You would.

01:20.412 --> 01:23.473
<i>We're ready to crown our winner here

<i>Looking for our new Queen of Hearts-

Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! You won!

01:33.592 --> 01:35.890
- No, I didn't even enter, Maria.
- I entered for us.

01:35.961 --> 01:38.794
- This is so exciting.
- Congratulations, Liz Parker.

01:38.864 --> 01:41.128
Your life is about
to change because...

01:41.199 --> 01:43.725
we're gonna find you that dream man
you've been searching for.

01:43.802 --> 01:46.271
Hey, what's running
through your mind right now, Liz?

01:46.338 --> 01:50.798

even heard about it.

02:41.693 --> 02:43.627
I don't know what the problem is.
This could be big.

02:43.695 --> 02:46.289
Your dream guy. Tailor-made.
The human version.

02:46.365 --> 02:48.697
Okay, embarrassing,
humiliating, mortifying.

02:48.767 --> 02:50.792
I don't know.
Choose your S.A.T. word.

02:50.869 --> 02:53.702
I am not forgiving you
for a very, very long time.

02:53.772 --> 02:57.504
What is wrong with a normal date
with a normal guy for once?

02:57.576 --> 03:00.477
Look, it's not like
Max has changed his mind or anything.

03:00.545 --> 03:02.741
He dumped you.

03:02.814 --> 03:04.873
Think about it.
That's all I'm saying.

03:06.051 --> 03:08.748
- Oh, hey, Alex!
- Oh, hey, what's up?

03:08.820 --> 03:11.653
You lost the singer to your band?
What happened to Wendy Lavely?

03:11.723 --> 03:15.182
Uh, she got mono
from Peter Gulla.

03:15.260 --> 03:18.093
- Ew.
- She's lucky that's all she got.

03:18.163 --> 03:23.101
Oh, we have to find somebody before these
auditions tomorrow, otherwise we're screwed.

03:23.168 --> 03:26.035
Alex, Alex begging is so unbecoming.

03:26.104 --> 03:29.233
- What?
- I'll do it. I'll do it.

03:29.307 --> 03:31.298
Anyway, I'm so much better
than that prima donna.

03:31.376 --> 03:33.708
So, when should we rehearse?

03:33.779 --> 03:36.544
No, no. We're really
looking for somebody...

03:36.615 --> 03:39.448
with professional experience, so-

03:39.518 --> 03:42.317
Excuse me, Wednesday nights
at the Pizza Pan.

03:42.387 --> 03:46.381
- Will you tell him?
- Oh, yeah. She is so good at karaoke.

03:46.458 --> 03:48.825
Maybe, but we play real music.

03:48.894 --> 03:52.797
Oh. So, I'm not good enough
for you, is what-

03:52.864 --> 03:56.630
Oh, no. No, I'm sure you're very good
at the karaoke, but-

03:56.701 --> 03:59.295
just not for you?

04:00.872 --> 04:04.172
All right. Stop by the garage
this afternoon, okay?

04:04.242 --> 04:07.906
Great. <i>I'll</i> see you at 4:00,
and <i>I'll</i> bring my charts.

04:07.979 --> 04:11.005
Yeah, your charts.

04:11.083 --> 04:16.749
<i>There she is! This is so incredible! I can't
believe you got picked for the blind date.</i>

04:16.822 --> 04:19.291
Evans.

04:19.357 --> 04:22.554
- I know your pain, man.
- I'm just fine, Kyle.

04:25.063 --> 04:27.725
I was in denial
in the beginning, too.

04:27.799 --> 04:31.360
I mean, one minute
she's telling me I'm the only one.

04:31.436 --> 04:34.497
Next, she's making
goo-goo eyes at you.

04:34.573 --> 04:39.010
<i>I can't deny it hurt.
All breakups do, huh?</i>

04:39.077 --> 04:41.478
We didn't break up, Kyle.

04:41.546 --> 04:45.881
Max, Max, Max, don't lie
to yourself like this.

04:45.951 --> 04:48.784
We didn't break up
because we were never together.

04:50.589 --> 04:53.217
She really did a number
on you, didn't she?

04:53.291 --> 04:57.023
But I've come to realize that's her pattern,
her M.O. She's a man-eater.

04:57.095 --> 05:00.622
And I pity the fool that radio station
fixes her up with, 'cause...

05:00.699 --> 05:05.000
she's gonna fall in love, and then
the hunger begins all over again.

05:06.071 --> 05:08.039
See ya.

05:20.852 --> 05:25.949
<i>Hmm. Wow. That wasn't bad! Wow.
The tempo kinda lagged there in the end.</i>

05:26.024 --> 05:29.961
And I would definitely turn the reverb
down on the bass, but not bad!

05:30.028 --> 05:32.759
- Who the hell is she?
- Guys, Maria. Maria, the guys.

05:32.831 --> 05:34.993
- Nicky on lead guitar. Chris on drums.
- Hi.

05:35.066 --> 05:38.434
- <i>Mar/ms on rhythm.</i>
- <i>Here you go.</i>

05:38.503 --> 05:42.497
- Yeah. These are, uh, my songs.
- We do our own stuff.

05:42.574 --> 05:44.508
I mean,you guys
wanna win this thing, right?

05:44.576 --> 05:46.510
And who isjudging it?
A radio station.

05:46.578 --> 05:49.775
And what songs do radio stations like?
They like the famous songs.

05:49.848 --> 05:52.249
You know, the songs
they play over and over and over again.

05:54.853 --> 05:56.912
These are-
These are pop songs.

05:56.988 --> 06:00.754
We're sort of
an alternative to that.

06:00.825 --> 06:04.125
Well, you're not the alternative
they're gonna choose.

06:04.196 --> 06:08.793
- We don't even know if you can sing.
- [ Scoffs]

06:08.867 --> 06:11.700

<i>All right, look.

06:15.407 --> 06:18.570
Michael, we don't know anything.

06:18.643 --> 06:21.510
I feel it, okay?
I mean, it was clear in my hallucination.

06:21.580 --> 06:24.208
Hallucination would be
the key word there.

06:25.917 --> 06:29.285
Let him talk, Max.
What's wrong with you today?

06:31.223 --> 06:34.318
Why would you invest yourself in something
you know isn't going to work out?

06:37.629 --> 06:40.496
Don't bring your personal problems
into this, Maxwell. It's too important.

06:40.565 --> 06:42.499
I'm talking about
the search you're on.

06:42.567 --> 06:45.195
Trying to find someone who could
possibly hurt us if we find them.

06:45.270 --> 06:48.296
The fourth alien is not a killer.
He's one of us.

06:48.373 --> 06:52.469
You heard Hubble tell us about the
other victims. About the handprints-

06:52.544 --> 06:57.038
No, I heard a crazy man. Tell him.
Tell him we gotta find this guy.

07:03.088 --> 07:07.355
Fine. Both of you sit here with your cherry colas
and your high school fantasies.

07:07.425 --> 07:09.757
I'm going to find him.

07:10.996 --> 07:13.021
You can't treat him
that way, Max.

07:13.098 --> 07:15.897
What am I supposed to do?
Encourage him to track down a murderer?

07:15.967 --> 07:18.664
We don't know what is
and isn't true yet.

07:20.472 --> 07:23.407
Michael needs his hope.
It's the only thing that keeps him going.

07:24.843 --> 07:27.005
What about you?

07:30.248 --> 07:34.776
You know, I don't know who I'd be
if I had spent the last 5O years on my own.

07:34.853 --> 07:37.788
If you were Nasedo, wouldn't you
want us to at least hear you out?

07:37.856 --> 07:40.018
It's a mistake, Isabel.

07:41.393 --> 07:43.327
Maybe.

07:43.395 --> 07:45.796
But you're never gonna convince him
of that without some proof.

07:50.735 --> 07:54.729
<i>And now it's time to check in

07:54.806 --> 07:59.039

- No, no, Maria.

08:05.617 --> 08:08.086
<i>- Hmm?</i>
- It's radio.

08:08.153 --> 08:10.645
Oh, I can't believe I'm doing this.

08:10.722 --> 08:13.020

08:18.229 --> 08:21.665

- Thank you.

08:21.733 --> 08:24.794
You mean to tell me
you don't already have a boyfriend?

08:24.869 --> 08:27.099
Um, no, not right now.

08:27.172 --> 08:29.607
Well, whoever let you get away

<i>when you're out

08:32.544 --> 08:34.672
Now answer some questions
for me now, Liz.

08:34.746 --> 08:38.239
- Do you like blonds or brunettes?
- Uh, brunettes.

08:38.316 --> 08:40.614
Okay. Hometown boys
or out-of-towners?

08:40.684 --> 08:45.282
Well, um, hometown boys
are okay, but-

08:45.357 --> 08:47.689
I hear the sound
of broken hearts all over Roswell.

08:47.759 --> 08:51.457
- Brainiac or class clown?
- Yeah, I'm not into clowns.

08:51.529 --> 08:53.520
Open books or challenges?

08:53.598 --> 08:56.499
Yeah, I guess I'm always
up for a challenge.

08:56.568 --> 09:00.630
It sounds like we've gotta find you
a serious, dark-haired, mystery man...

09:24.129 --> 09:26.723
What was that one called again?

09:26.798 --> 09:30.792
- “Love Kills.“
- Wasn't that the first one you played?

09:30.869 --> 09:33.770
No, that was “Hurt By Love.“

09:33.838 --> 09:36.364
No vocalist, huh?
just you guys?

09:36.441 --> 09:39.775
Well, we're waiting for her.
I mean, she should be here any second now.

09:39.844 --> 09:41.938
<i>Why don't we go through
another one until she gets here?</i>

09:42.013 --> 09:44.846
You know what?
We have two other bands to see by 5:00.

09:44.916 --> 09:48.375
I'm here! I'm here! I'm so sorry.
Liz was getting interviewed.

09:48.453 --> 09:50.387
Oh, my God, you guys waited.
Thank you so much.

09:50.455 --> 09:52.617

10:01.399 --> 10:03.163
I think she's cute.

10:03.234 --> 10:06.169
Well, look, this is my band, okay?

10:06.237 --> 10:09.798
Look, Alex, all right?
It's all about personality, okay?

10:52.550 --> 10:54.882
You're gonna get some phone numbers
is what you're gonna do.

10:54.953 --> 10:56.887
Maria, look,
this is serious, okay?

10:56.955 --> 10:59.652
This contest has
completely taken over my life.

10:59.724 --> 11:01.385
Okay, have you thought
about Max today?

11:01.459 --> 11:04.690
No, I-l haven't
really had any time.

11:04.762 --> 11:09.324
Mission accomplished. Besides, it's gonna
be over after the concert tonight, okay?

11:09.400 --> 11:12.335
Let's talk about clothes. I just spent
two hours and 5O bucks at the thrift shop.

11:12.403 --> 11:15.634
- What do you think?
- I thought you already had an outfit.

11:15.707 --> 11:19.473
- No, this is for the guys.
- I think they like to dress themselves, Maria.

11:19.544 --> 11:21.478
That's the whole problem.
They have, like, no style.

11:21.546 --> 11:27.007
We have very specific style.
It's called normal, not thrift shop freak.

11:27.085 --> 11:30.385
Your answering machine's fixed. ltjust
needed to be reset after the hundredth call.

11:30.455 --> 11:32.822
There are a lot
of desperate guys out there.

11:32.891 --> 11:35.986
Alex, I really don't want to go on stage
with you guys looking like high school geeks.

11:36.060 --> 11:38.495
We are high school geeks,
and we like it like that.

11:38.563 --> 11:42.056
So, please stop trying to
take control over it, okay?

11:42.133 --> 11:46.195
Well, you know, ifit hadn't been for me,
you guys wouldn't have gotten the gig, so-

11:46.271 --> 11:49.935
Okay. Then you wanna know what?
We'll just cancel the whole thing.

11:50.008 --> 11:52.409
Okay, you guys,
just time-out, all right?

11:52.477 --> 11:55.344
This is, like, your big break, you know?
Opening for Smashmouth.

11:55.413 --> 11:58.348
Wait, the mystery band is Smashmouth?
Did the radio station tell you that?

11:58.416 --> 12:01.249
No, no. I am sorry.
I was just guessing.

12:01.319 --> 12:04.311
- 'Cause I thought itwas gonna be Oasis.
- Barenaked Ladies. Five bucks.

12:04.389 --> 12:06.357
Oh, you guys,
the point is here...

12:06.424 --> 12:09.086
why don't you guys just,
I don't know, like, be yourselves?

12:09.160 --> 12:11.595
Alex, do one of Maria's songs...

12:11.663 --> 12:14.689
and then, Maria,
then you do one of the band's songs.

12:14.766 --> 12:17.133
