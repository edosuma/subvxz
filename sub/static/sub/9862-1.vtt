00:59.473 --> 01:01.270
One, two, three....

01:01.341 --> 01:02.740
Hold up.

01:04.544 --> 01:06.535
Here's the story about a man

01:07.647 --> 01:09.046
A simple man

01:09.916 --> 01:13.682
A man with a dream
To do the world some good

01:14.020 --> 01:16.352
Here's a story for rich and poor

01:17.023 --> 01:18.547
For young and for old

01:19.025 --> 01:23.052
About a man from the 'hood
Trying to do the world some good

01:23.463 --> 01:25.590
Here's the story about a man

01:26.500 --> 01:27.933
An everyday man

01:28.902 --> 01:31.370
A man with a dream

01:31.438 --> 01:33.599
To be the head ofstate

01:39.312 --> 01:41.974
Alderman Gilliam's office.
What are you upset about?

01:42.048 --> 01:44.312
It's not a black-owned business?

01:44.384 --> 01:47.876
-But it's a Chinese food restaurant.
-So, what's with the fried rice?

01:47.954 --> 01:51.082
I know it's fried rice, but it's not "fried" rice.

01:51.625 --> 01:53.149
Alderman Gilliam's office.

01:53.226 --> 01:55.524
Kim. How is it going, honey?

01:55.595 --> 01:57.222
-Got tickets to the symphony.
-Really?

01:57.297 --> 02:01.028
-Hold on a second, l got another call.
-You better not put me on hold.

02:01.101 --> 02:03.661
Vote for Gaines and James.

02:03.737 --> 02:07.571
-The Million Babies Mamas March?
-It's a very good cause.

02:07.641 --> 02:10.109
Call Reverend Barton for that one. No...

02:10.176 --> 02:13.704
you can't use food stamps to buy tires.

02:14.915 --> 02:17.349
I'm sorry, Mr. Hawkins.
What can l do for you?

02:17.417 --> 02:18.884
Your girlfriend is on hold.

02:18.952 --> 02:21.216
-Hold on a second.
-How could you put me on hold?

02:21.288 --> 02:24.086
-What was it, Mr. Hawkins?
-The bus.

02:24.157 --> 02:26.853
I read that they're going to shut down
our bus line.

02:26.927 --> 02:29.259
If they do that, l can't get to work!

02:29.329 --> 02:32.127
Unless they give me a job
in that new mall they're building.

02:32.199 --> 02:34.929
Don't worry. I've been talking
to the people downtown...

02:35.001 --> 02:36.525
and l promise you this:

02:36.603 --> 02:40.266
If they shut down this bus line,
l will drive you to work myself.

02:40.640 --> 02:42.232
You got my word.

02:43.677 --> 02:45.941
Alderman Gilliam, quick! Miss Pearl is back!

02:46.012 --> 02:47.411
Okay. I got to go.

02:53.620 --> 02:58.580
Hi, that's me, Mays Gilliam, aIderman
of the 9th Ward of Washington, D.C.

02:58.892 --> 03:01.224
Not the part of D.C. you're familiar with.

03:01.294 --> 03:05.492
I work in a neighborhood so bad,
you can get shot while you're getting shot.

03:05.765 --> 03:10.099
Around here when people have a problem,
they don't caIl the mayor, they caIl me.

03:16.109 --> 03:17.269
Miss Pearl!

03:18.945 --> 03:20.537
What's going on?

03:23.083 --> 03:26.075
Dionne is in the house. I know she is.

03:26.152 --> 03:30.088
I don't know what she's talking about.
We checked the house, nobody is in there.

03:30.156 --> 03:32.249
Hey, man, Dionne is her cat.

03:32.325 --> 03:34.987
Whatever. Cats got nine lives. She'll be fine.

03:35.061 --> 03:37.894
Can we let one guy go in
and help this lady get her cat?

03:37.964 --> 03:41.297
Can't do it. Once they laid the explosives,
there's nothing l can do.

03:41.368 --> 03:42.426
She just showed up.

03:42.502 --> 03:45.630
You took the lady's house.
Can you at least let her get her cat?

03:45.705 --> 03:47.764
We didn't take it, we gave her $40,000.

03:47.841 --> 03:51.641
What kind of house is she supposed to get
with $40,000? A crack house?

03:51.711 --> 03:53.941
I think she'd be happy to get out
of this rattrap.

03:54.014 --> 03:56.539
Who are you to call this place a rattrap?

03:56.616 --> 04:00.882
This is my neighborhood, where l'm from.
I got my first bike stolen right there.

04:00.954 --> 04:03.115
My daddy got his bike stolen right there.

04:03.189 --> 04:07.285
When l have a son, l hope he's fortunate
enough to get stuck up right there.

04:07.360 --> 04:10.056
-Can't you let somebody go check?
-We already looked.

04:10.130 --> 04:12.360
There's nothing in there. We got work to do.

04:12.432 --> 04:14.161
Leave the people alone, damn it!

04:14.234 --> 04:15.997
-Let's get this thing going.
-Come on.

04:16.069 --> 04:18.867
-Stop being in such a hurry.
-We've been here all morning.

04:18.939 --> 04:20.839
Let the lady go inside.

04:21.408 --> 04:23.808
Come on, baby! Sugar baby.

04:24.611 --> 04:27.409
Could you at least turn it off?
Let the lady get her cat.

04:27.480 --> 04:30.881
Dionne, baby? l got something for you!

04:32.986 --> 04:34.283
Miss Pearl, no!

04:36.890 --> 04:40.087
All right, turn it off.
Wait till this woman gets her cat.

04:40.193 --> 04:41.683
Shit, it's not working!

04:41.761 --> 04:42.921
Turn it off!

04:43.430 --> 04:45.796
She better get out, it's going to blow!

04:46.099 --> 04:48.533
Miss Pearl! Come out!

04:49.736 --> 04:50.725
No, Mays!

04:52.405 --> 04:54.134
You've only got a minute!

04:57.010 --> 04:59.103
-Fix it! Get to work.
-I'm trying.

04:59.512 --> 05:01.002
Get a union man on this.

05:01.548 --> 05:03.140
Get your ass out!

05:06.119 --> 05:10.180
Miss Pearl, we got to get out of here.
They're going to blow this place up.

05:10.824 --> 05:14.260
They wouldn't do that, baby!
They know we're in here.

05:14.794 --> 05:18.525
I love you, l've known you a long time.
You've seen a lot in your life.

05:18.598 --> 05:21.590
You've seen churches burnt to the ground,
dogs sicced on kids...

05:21.668 --> 05:23.898
you've seen Malcolm X and JFK killed.

05:23.970 --> 05:26.029
They shut up Muhammad Ali
and Richard Pryor.

05:26.106 --> 05:28.802
They gave Magic Johnson AIDS,
turned Michael Jackson white.

05:28.875 --> 05:32.174
Do you really think these people
give a damn about you?

05:54.009 --> 05:57.035
We interrupt the Jay-Z song
to bring you this speciaI bulletin.

05:57.112 --> 05:59.205
PresidentiaI candidate Senator Gaines...

05:59.281 --> 06:01.215
and his running mate,
GeneraI Olson James...

06:01.283 --> 06:04.275
were both killed when their planes
crashed into each other.

06:04.353 --> 06:07.481
We now return you to the Jay-Z song
aIready in progress.

06:26.375 --> 06:27.364
What's up?

06:27.442 --> 06:30.775
Trying to be like you, hero!
What's up, man? Saving kittens?

06:30.846 --> 06:32.279
Don't steal my car now.

06:32.347 --> 06:36.408
I don't want that garbage.
What will l do, feed your car to my car?

06:37.419 --> 06:41.082
Let me get ten Nine Lives,
four Lucky Ducks, two Straight Pokers...

06:41.190 --> 06:43.317
three Crabpots and five Powerballs.

06:44.092 --> 06:45.992
Thank you, here you go.

06:51.066 --> 06:53.193
You all need to stop.

06:58.740 --> 07:00.571
Why are all these people clapping?

07:00.642 --> 07:03.236
-You didn't see me on the news?
-No, l didn't.

07:03.412 --> 07:05.380
I got meat!

07:05.514 --> 07:09.143
More beef than East Coast, West Coast rap.
Check it out!

07:10.152 --> 07:12.416
Superman! Saving lives and stuff.

07:12.487 --> 07:14.717
Why don't you cop
one of these pork chops?

07:14.790 --> 07:18.021
Know what you need to do?
You need to leave. I won't tell you again.

07:18.093 --> 07:21.426
Nobody wants your meat.
Who the hell wants to buy stolen meat?

07:21.496 --> 07:23.896
-I'll take a T-bone.
-You like gizzards, too?

07:26.802 --> 07:29.532
Did you hear about that guy
running for President?

07:29.605 --> 07:31.232
Who will replace him?

07:31.306 --> 07:34.207
Maybe they should get Shaq.
Nobody can beat him.

07:34.276 --> 07:36.676
Are you getting gas?
You're holding my line up.

07:36.745 --> 07:38.110
Yeah, l'm sorry.

07:38.847 --> 07:40.041
$10 on three.

07:50.692 --> 07:53.160
You've got a lot of nerve hanging up on me.

07:53.228 --> 07:54.354
Hanging up?

07:54.496 --> 07:57.761
-What's going on?
-I'm leaving you! That's what's going on.

07:57.833 --> 08:01.667
The only reason l accepted this engagement
ring from you in the first place...

08:01.737 --> 08:04.604
is because l thought you had potential!

08:04.673 --> 08:06.937
I thought you wanted more!

08:07.242 --> 08:10.643
Why can't you just play the game?
Wear a suit!

08:10.946 --> 08:12.811
Be a real politician!

08:12.881 --> 08:16.180
What's my clothes have to do with....
Are you seeing somebody else?

08:16.251 --> 08:18.276
I'm seeing everybody else!

08:19.154 --> 08:21.987
I've met mosquitoes
with more force than you.

08:22.057 --> 08:26.016
I'm tired of your little games,
tired of being your little secretary.

08:26.094 --> 08:28.187
Here's the light bill. I didn't pay it.

08:28.263 --> 08:30.697
Here's the cable bill. I didn't pay that, either.

08:30.766 --> 08:33.394
And here's the bill for your car note.

08:33.702 --> 08:35.465
I hope they take it!

08:36.238 --> 08:38.467
Wait a minute, that's my car!

08:38.774 --> 08:40.241
Wait, come back!

08:41.543 --> 08:44.171
I hate that piece of shit!

08:45.213 --> 08:49.172
I'm tired of spending my time
waiting for you to quit acting like a child...

08:49.251 --> 08:52.550
and act like a grown man
for a change, Mays!

08:52.821 --> 08:54.789
I need to get on with my life!

08:54.856 --> 08:57.188
I want a house, l want children!

08:57.259 --> 09:00.387
I want to go on vacation!
You're horrible in bed!

09:00.996 --> 09:03.897
I am tired of being engaged.
I am tired of being--

09:08.136 --> 09:10.661
I wish you would.

09:15.110 --> 09:17.578
For the last time,
l'm not running for President.

09:17.646 --> 09:21.707
I'm not crazy! Gaines was 20 points behind.
It's ten weeks to Election Day.

09:21.783 --> 09:22.943
Damn it!

09:23.151 --> 09:26.780
They should have known better
than to talk on a cell phone in a plane.

09:26.855 --> 09:29.119
-What about Sanderson?
-That's a joke.

09:29.191 --> 09:31.455
Lewis has been Vice-President
for eight years.

09:31.526 --> 09:34.154
He's a war hero and Sharon Stone's cousin.
He can't lose.

09:34.229 --> 09:35.924
-What about Mosley?
-Girls.

09:36.031 --> 09:37.157
-Connelly?
-Boys.

09:37.232 --> 09:39.063
-McMasters?
-Big boys.

09:39.134 --> 09:41.500
So we concede the election to Lewis?

09:41.570 --> 09:45.631
Nobody is talking about conceding,
Debra, but let's get real here.

09:45.807 --> 09:47.399
We'll lose this one.

09:48.076 --> 09:51.637
The thing to do is to set the party up
for the next election.

09:51.813 --> 09:54.907
We need a candidate
that will put on a good show.

09:54.983 --> 09:58.384
This isn't a circus,
it's a presidential election.

09:58.954 --> 10:00.945
You can't just pick some guy...

10:01.623 --> 10:03.853
to run for President.

10:03.925 --> 10:07.190
It's unprecedented,
but if l put in a call to the party chairman...

10:07.262 --> 10:09.457
we find a candidate, he'll back him.

10:09.998 --> 10:12.330
Who will run a race
they know they can't win?

10:12.400 --> 10:13.867
Who says he has to know?

10:22.644 --> 10:23.804
What the....

10:35.257 --> 10:36.519
What now?

10:40.328 --> 10:41.920
No, not my bike!

10:47.836 --> 10:50.805
When l went in there
l wasn't thinking about being a hero.

10:50.872 --> 10:53.136
I wasjust trying to help Miss Pearl.

10:53.208 --> 10:54.539
Miss Pearl.

10:55.177 --> 10:56.906
I think we found our man.

10:57.445 --> 10:59.276
Look at this! This is great!

10:59.548 --> 11:01.539
This is America, see?

11:01.983 --> 11:05.146
Little guy against the big guy,
corporations against the people.

11:05.220 --> 11:07.120
Young versus old. What's better than this?

11:07.189 --> 11:08.986
Give me a break!

11:09.191 --> 11:11.716
I am going to run an alderman
for President?

11:12.894 --> 11:14.691
He's not an alderman.

11:14.963 --> 11:16.362
He's a hero.

11:17.365 --> 11:20.425
-Who doesn't like a hero?
-Big business loves a hero!

11:20.502 --> 11:21.662
See?

11:21.736 --> 11:24.136
You said we needed somebody
who can help the party.

11:24.206 --> 11:27.039
Now, how in the hell
does this guy help the party?

11:27.209 --> 11:28.676
I'm glad you asked.

11:29.311 --> 11:31.802
The United States is changing.
America is changing.

11:31.880 --> 11:33.973
Inside of 20 years, you know the numbers...

11:34.049 --> 11:37.951
20 percent black,
21 percent Asian, 39 percent Hispanic.

11:38.019 --> 11:42.183
The minorities will be the majority.
The smartest thing we can do...

11:42.357 --> 11:46.794
is be the first party
to nominate a minority for President.

11:46.995 --> 11:49.793
-How about a cripple?
-I don't think so, Charlie.

11:50.332 --> 11:54.462
Now, we'll lose, of course,
but the minorities will be happy.

11:54.936 --> 11:59.600
The minorities will be happy
and they will vote for us in 2008...

11:59.774 --> 12:01.605
because we've shown we support them.

12:01.676 --> 12:04.270
And the white people will vote for us...

12:04.646 --> 12:07.171
-because our guy isn't black.
-You got my vote!

12:07.249 --> 12:10.741
Geller, see if you can track down
this Mays Gilliam.

12:13.054 --> 12:14.919
Go check our accounts.

12:24.633 --> 12:27.966
Give me one good reason
why l should go along with this.

12:28.036 --> 12:31.870
Don't you get it, Debra?
l intend to run for President in 2008.

12:33.875 --> 12:37.003
Now give me one reason why you shouldn't.

12:41.149 --> 12:42.980
He would take a lot of work.

12:43.385 --> 12:45.353
We can run a background check...

12:45.420 --> 12:47.615
but it's obvious
he's not a party line candidate.

12:47.689 --> 12:50.385
He's just some kid
who thinks he can make a difference.

12:50.458 --> 12:53.325
Don't worry. Go out there,
put the machine behind him.

12:53.395 --> 12:56.330
You get 25 points in the polls,
consider it a win.

12:56.831 --> 12:58.924
Make sure he doesn't embarrass us.

12:59.000 --> 13:01.594
After this is over, we get to work.

13:02.971 --> 13:06.270
When l'm President, l'll take care of you.

13:08.643 --> 13:10.804
Help me. They locked me out of my office.

13:10.879 --> 13:13.609
I know. The mayor is fed up with you.

13:14.816 --> 13:18.047
How many times have l told you?
You got to quit trying to fix shit.

13:18.119 --> 13:21.247
I could've got you into the council
next term. Now you're red-lined.

13:21.323 --> 13:23.086
Shannon is taking over your district.

13:23.158 --> 13:26.616
They need to smooth over the mall
situation, that bus thing is heating up.

13:26.695 --> 13:29.721
-They don't trust you.
-I'm not the one stealing people's houses.

13:29.798 --> 13:32.892
That's what your problem is.
You got to work with us.

13:33.902 --> 13:36.530
That shit you pulled over there
cost the city money.

13:36.604 --> 13:38.595
Makes the mayor look bad.

13:38.940 --> 13:43.536
Now, contrary to popular belief,
politics is no place to express yourself.

13:43.745 --> 13:45.906
You want to get in, you got to fit in.

13:46.047 --> 13:48.982
And look at you.
Grow up, you got to dress better.

13:49.050 --> 13:51.678
Even Puff Daddy wears a suit to court.

13:54.389 --> 13:57.051
I'm sorry, brother, but ain't nothing l can do.

14:00.662 --> 14:02.823
-Nice car.
-Ain't it, though?

14:02.931 --> 14:05.456
Got it for a song at a repo auction.

14:28.223 --> 14:30.657
He feels bad, mighty low

14:30.725 --> 14:32.556
Got nowhere to go

14:32.961 --> 14:35.327
What can you do when you're feeling low

14:35.397 --> 14:37.388
Man, l want to know

14:37.699 --> 14:41.499
He feels bad, mighty low
Got nowhere to go

14:41.836 --> 14:44.964
What can you do when you're feeling low

14:45.340 --> 14:47.774
And your carjust got repo'd

15:16.769 --> 15:18.202
Here we are.

15:18.371 --> 15:20.566
Mays Gilliam, Debra Lassiter.

15:22.208 --> 15:24.438
Nice to meet you. Take a seat.

15:30.182 --> 15:33.276
We know what happened today.
We know you lost your job.

15:34.654 --> 15:36.645
How do you know that? lt just happened.

15:36.722 --> 15:39.122
We're the government. We know everything.

15:39.926 --> 15:42.156
We'd like you to do something for us.

15:42.228 --> 15:45.755
Sure, l'd love to work
on a presidential campaign.

15:46.198 --> 15:48.894
I'll make phone calls, send out fliers.

15:49.602 --> 15:52.093
Who have you guys chosen
to run against Lewis?

15:52.171 --> 15:55.038
That's exactly what we wanted
to talk to you about.

15:55.241 --> 15:58.506
We'd like you to run for President.

16:05.251 --> 16:08.118
-Of what?
-The United States.

16:09.088 --> 16:11.113
-Of what?
-Of America

16:11.524 --> 16:12.513
Which America?

16:12.592 --> 16:13.820
North...

16:14.260 --> 16:15.921
America, Mays.

16:16.128 --> 16:17.720
Get out of here!

16:18.097 --> 16:19.655
We're not joking.

16:20.499 --> 16:23.491
We want you to be the nominee
for the office of President...

16:23.569 --> 16:25.901
of the United States of America

16:31.277 --> 16:33.108
Let me get this straight.

16:33.179 --> 16:37.081
You guys couldn't find anybody else to run?
You couldn't find nobody?

16:37.283 --> 16:38.773
Something is wrong here.

16:38.851 --> 16:40.944
You couldn't find a congressman...

16:41.020 --> 16:43.648
a senator? l'm just an alderman.

16:43.756 --> 16:47.556
Congressmen, senators,
they work with other politicians.

16:47.994 --> 16:50.622
You're an alderman.
You work with the people.

16:50.696 --> 16:54.097
And that's what we want,
a man of the people.

16:54.200 --> 16:55.861
This is a big joke, right?

16:55.935 --> 16:58.028
They've got a hidden camera somewhere.

16:58.104 --> 17:01.437
You all will get a big laugh out of this.
You know what? l don't care.

17:01.507 --> 17:04.964
One of you all will drive me home
because my bike is messed up.

17:05.578 --> 17:07.102
You an American?

17:09.548 --> 17:12.073
-Are you an American?
-Yes.

17:13.653 --> 17:16.348
This isn't just an election. It's a moment.

17:16.555 --> 17:20.012
This is the moment when you have
the opportunity to show boys and girls...

17:20.092 --> 17:22.424
men and women, what America is about.

17:23.429 --> 17:24.896
Look at that.

17:26.232 --> 17:31.101
When l see that, l think of our forefathers
fighting to make this country what it is.

17:31.771 --> 17:36.435
When l see it l think about the guy who has
to scrub Lincoln's balls for minimum wage.

17:37.076 --> 17:40.637
That's why we want you.
You care about the little people.

17:41.514 --> 17:42.879
What will it be?

17:59.065 --> 18:00.794
It gives me great honor...

18:01.033 --> 18:03.331
to accept the party's nomination...

18:03.436 --> 18:04.869
for President...

18:04.937 --> 18:07.804
of the United States ofAmerica.

18:08.641 --> 18:09.630
No!

18:16.457 --> 18:19.085
Welcome to your campaign headquarters.

18:19.593 --> 18:23.120
These folks will do everything they can
to help you get elected.

18:23.297 --> 18:24.958
These are your people.

18:26.066 --> 18:28.034
Here. Let's take a look at this.

18:28.102 --> 18:30.798
Mark, is that cued up? Roll it, please.

18:38.512 --> 18:40.605
This is a great spot.

18:41.715 --> 18:46.015
Ifyou love America,
vote Mays Gilliam for President.

18:51.058 --> 18:52.423
But l'm not in it.

18:53.394 --> 18:54.759
You don't even see my face.

18:54.828 --> 18:57.058
It's a template.
We'll get you in there eventually.

18:57.131 --> 18:59.622
There's a couple of people
l want you to meet.

18:59.700 --> 19:02.669
This is your security director, Mr. Earl.

19:02.770 --> 19:05.432
-You'll be in good hands.
-Pleased to meet you, sir.

19:05.506 --> 19:09.772
If you're in trouble, yell "Security!"
and my people will handle the situation.

19:09.944 --> 19:13.345
This is your decoy, Mays Junior.
He enters events before you.

19:13.414 --> 19:16.247
If anything'll happen to you,
it'll happen to him first.

19:16.317 --> 19:18.478
Tupac could have used a guy like you.

19:18.552 --> 19:22.989
This is Nicollette White, she's
your executive director of lnternal Liaisons.

19:23.057 --> 19:25.423
Call me Nikki.
It will be a pleasure to serve you.

19:25.492 --> 19:28.620
I'm available to you around the clock,
just let me know.

19:29.897 --> 19:33.128
-What does she do?
-She sleeps with you.

19:33.634 --> 19:36.034
We got tired of getting caught up
in sex scandals...

19:36.103 --> 19:38.765
so we commissioned
our own team of super whores.

19:38.839 --> 19:40.500
You call yourself whores!

19:40.574 --> 19:42.508
Move that fat ass! One, two, three!

19:43.010 --> 19:45.774
-These girls are good.
-Good morning, Mays.

19:45.980 --> 19:49.973
I took the liberty of choosing some options
for this evening's fundraiser.

19:50.250 --> 19:51.376
You don't mind, do you?

19:51.452 --> 19:54.853
I'll wear whatever you need me to wear.
What fundraiser is this?

19:54.922 --> 19:57.891
Your coming out party.
Campaigns cost money.

19:57.958 --> 20:00.324
The people you meet tonight
have plenty of it.

20:00.394 --> 20:02.419
Geller and l will advance the party...

20:02.496 --> 20:05.226
and Mr. Earl will bring you at 8:00 sharp.

20:05.499 --> 20:08.900
Here are your off-the-cuff remarks.
Learn them. See you later.

20:17.587 --> 20:20.283
Remember, sir, just nod and move.
Nod and move.

20:22.458 --> 20:24.289
What do you plan to do about taxes?

20:24.360 --> 20:26.851
Do you plan to support
paternal leave incentives?

20:26.929 --> 20:28.988
Get my demo to somebody. Anybody.

20:29.699 --> 20:32.497
Don't take unscreened packages.
Security reasons.

20:33.436 --> 20:35.802
You have some people to talk to.
Tomorrow, work.

20:35.872 --> 20:38.363
Tonight, smile, shake hands,
and be nice to the wives.

20:38.441 --> 20:41.877
I'll double-check the PA system.
You'll make a brief statement at 1 1 :00.

20:41.944 --> 20:43.172
Let's go.

20:51.821 --> 20:54.881
Hi, how are you doing? All right.
You all right.

20:57.927 --> 21:00.725
-I wish you luck, sir.
-Arigatou.

21:04.066 --> 21:07.160
It's like Timberland,
and l got a bit of Missy moving up there...

21:07.236 --> 21:09.830
but l'm trying to go through
that Neptune feel--

21:09.906 --> 21:12.238
Excuse me, the Teamsters are here.

21:12.575 --> 21:14.600
What are you doing talking to the help?

21:14.677 --> 21:16.770
Gentlemen, Mr. Mays Gilliam.

21:16.846 --> 21:20.543
Guys, l'm all for labor, l'm all for unions.

21:20.616 --> 21:23.244
But you know and l know
that you will endorse Lewis.

21:23.319 --> 21:25.879
It's business.
We'll do what's best for the union.

21:25.955 --> 21:28.822
-Have you decided on a running mate?
-We're thinking about it.

21:28.891 --> 21:32.520
-You should consider Sanders.
-We're considering several options.

21:34.430 --> 21:35.522
Excuse me.

21:35.765 --> 21:36.959
Well, that depends.

21:37.033 --> 21:38.625
What's up with this guy?

21:38.701 --> 21:41.101
Track four. Check out track four.

21:47.310 --> 21:48.709
What do you have there?

21:48.778 --> 21:51.872
We got shrimp puffs and cheese snacks...

21:51.948 --> 21:55.076
-just some finger foods.
-Thought that was you.

21:55.418 --> 21:57.784
So what's up with the two jobs? Bad credit?

21:57.853 --> 22:02.290
Why do l have to have bad credit?
Can't l be saving up for a car or for school?

22:02.358 --> 22:04.918
Maybe l like to work? Excuse me.

22:05.761 --> 22:08.457
I'm sorry. You know what?
l never got your name.

22:09.966 --> 22:13.333
Hey, Lisa Clark. Mays.
Why you being so rude, Lisa Clark?

22:13.402 --> 22:15.427
I am not being rude, l am working.

22:15.504 --> 22:18.268
We can't mingle with the guests.
Plus, l don't know you.

22:18.341 --> 22:20.969
-You know me.
-No, l don't know you.

22:21.043 --> 22:22.169
But you know me.

22:22.244 --> 22:25.077
You've come to the gas station
a couple of times...

22:25.147 --> 22:27.843
and l see you, but l don't know you.

22:27.917 --> 22:29.544
Let's get to know each other.

22:29.618 --> 22:31.245
-Let's dance.
-I have to work.

22:31.320 --> 22:35.416
I know you're working. I'm working, too.
So let's keep working. Want to dance?

22:35.491 --> 22:37.482
Okay, you'll get me in trouble.

22:44.667 --> 22:47.602
I cannot believe
you got me out here like this.

22:47.803 --> 22:50.465
-Yeah, but you like it, right?
-A little.

22:58.581 --> 23:00.105
I'm feeling it.

23:11.894 --> 23:13.589
Go ahead, girl, work it!

23:25.775 --> 23:29.006
Oh, my God. I'm having too much fun.
I got to get back to work.

23:29.078 --> 23:30.739
No, come on, stay!

23:31.480 --> 23:32.606
Come on!

23:35.584 --> 23:38.314
Come on, brother,
l know you know how to do this dance.

23:38.387 --> 23:39.752
No, sorry, l don't.

23:39.822 --> 23:42.985
I know you know
how to do the Electric Slide.

23:43.159 --> 23:45.787
No, l can't say that l do.

23:46.629 --> 23:48.494
Get your ass in there!

23:53.402 --> 23:56.098
-What the hell is this?
-Where's Mays?

23:58.808 --> 23:59.934
Over there.

24:01.377 --> 24:03.140
-Oh, my God!
-We've got to stop him.

24:03.212 --> 24:04.611
Excuse us, please.

24:05.648 --> 24:09.675
I am getting so hot
l am gonna take my clothes off

24:09.752 --> 24:12.380
-What do you think you're doing?
-Stop it.

24:12.888 --> 24:15.413
I'm just trying to get the party started.

24:16.725 --> 24:18.750
Throw your hands in the air

24:18.828 --> 24:20.955
And wave them like youjust don't care

24:21.030 --> 24:23.225
And if l got your vote for President

24:23.299 --> 24:25.494
Let me hear you say, "Oh, yeah"

24:28.170 --> 24:30.195
Shake that ass, Grandma!

24:30.639 --> 24:32.903
Let me see you bounce!

24:33.476 --> 24:34.773
Bounce!

24:35.544 --> 24:38.104
We got a couple of freaks over there.

24:40.549 --> 24:42.483
Let me see you shake!

24:45.121 --> 24:46.486
Crip walk!

24:57.266 --> 24:59.291
The roof is on fire!

25:00.569 --> 25:01.968
No, it's a saying!

25:04.974 --> 25:06.874
It's just a saying. Come back!

25:09.645 --> 25:13.775
You turned the party out.
I have never seen anything like that.

25:13.883 --> 25:16.078
Great party. Too bad about the fire.

25:17.820 --> 25:20.948
-So, where are you off to now?
-I'm not even sure.

25:21.023 --> 25:24.390
We start campaigning tomorrow.
We'll be all over the country.

25:25.427 --> 25:26.621
Need a ride home?

25:26.695 --> 25:29.994
I still have to clean up.
I don't know how long that will take me.

25:30.065 --> 25:31.532
I could wait.

25:32.134 --> 25:35.160
Are you sure?
l could send a car to pick you up.

25:35.237 --> 25:37.364
No, thanks, but l got to go.

25:37.439 --> 25:39.134
It was good seeing you again.

25:39.208 --> 25:41.870
You too, buddy, old pal.

25:43.412 --> 25:45.937
-Can l get a good-night kiss?
-No.

25:47.383 --> 25:49.476
-I'm coming!
-She's coming!

25:50.152 --> 25:54.418
I got to go. Good luck,
and call me if you get a chance.

25:57.026 --> 25:58.755
Didn't you see me talking?

25:59.261 --> 26:01.195
What kind of display was that?

26:01.263 --> 26:02.992
I was getting the party started.

26:03.065 --> 26:06.193
If the party needs to get started,
l'll handle it.

26:06.602 --> 26:08.570
Just do what we say.

26:08.637 --> 26:11.868
I don't think everybody appreciated
what you did in there.

26:11.941 --> 26:13.636
We really had a great time.

26:13.709 --> 26:15.836
It was off the hizzle for shizzle.

26:16.712 --> 26:19.306
-They liked it.
-I don't care what they liked.

26:19.515 --> 26:21.142
Mays, darling!

26:26.155 --> 26:29.647
Darling, are you done yet?
No? lf not, it's okay. I can wait.

26:29.725 --> 26:32.990
But if we hurry,
we'll be able to get a table at Jezebel's.

26:34.363 --> 26:36.524
Good evening. We're getting married.

26:37.433 --> 26:38.695
I'm exhausted.

26:39.501 --> 26:40.832
Know what l can't decide?

26:40.903 --> 26:43.997
I can't decide whether we should have
a DJ or a band.

26:46.108 --> 26:47.370
Security!

27:02.739 --> 27:05.970
Thank you for inviting me
to the land of milk and honey.

27:06.043 --> 27:08.170
It's you people, the dairy people...

27:08.245 --> 27:11.078
people that make eggs, milk, cheese...

27:11.148 --> 27:14.242
butter, bacon, that make the country great.

27:14.418 --> 27:17.854
Milk makes the body good,
and you make the country good.

27:22.125 --> 27:25.185
Thank you for inviting me
to Memphis, Tennessee.

27:25.996 --> 27:28.988
It's people like you, the church people...

27:29.132 --> 27:33.228
who are the backbone
and the spirit of this great land of ours.

27:34.771 --> 27:38.798
I love the Lord,
and l love the King, Elvis Presley.

27:42.646 --> 27:46.946
I want to thank you for inviting me
to the Lone Star State.

27:49.152 --> 27:50.619
Home of the cowboys!

27:51.855 --> 27:53.482
How about them Cowboys?

27:54.424 --> 27:57.018
It's people like you, the ranchers...

27:57.294 --> 27:59.558
who are the backbone of this country.

28:00.998 --> 28:04.661
Now, before l go,
l got one more thing to say:

28:05.902 --> 28:09.269
The stars at night are big and bright

28:09.873 --> 28:12.364
Deep in the heart of Texas

28:16.313 --> 28:17.302
It's not bad.

28:17.381 --> 28:19.679
Will l get another speech anytime soon?

28:19.750 --> 28:21.513
What's the matter with this speech?

28:21.585 --> 28:24.986
I should be talking about something
a little more relevant.

28:25.389 --> 28:26.413
Relevant?

28:26.490 --> 28:29.857
People would be cheering
if l read the recipe for corn bread.

28:29.926 --> 28:32.394
It's not working.
I'm only one point up in the polls.

28:32.462 --> 28:36.125
Don't worry about the polls.
They're just a sampling. Polls change.

28:36.199 --> 28:37.723
Don't get ahead of yourself.

28:37.801 --> 28:40.668
We're here to help.
The people really like you.

28:40.737 --> 28:44.138
Cheer up, we'll be in Chicago in a few days.
You got a brother there.

28:44.207 --> 28:46.607
Then the people will find out
what you're all about.

28:46.676 --> 28:49.372
Yeah, but l don't even know
what l'm all about.

28:56.293 --> 29:00.286
In the latest polls, Mays Gilliam is up
just one point, to 10 percent.

29:00.497 --> 29:03.989
Vice President Brian Lewis
still holds a commanding 84 percent.

29:04.067 --> 29:06.035
Six percent are undecided, saying...

29:06.103 --> 29:09.869
they don't know who they're voting for,
theyjust know it's not Gilliam.

29:10.107 --> 29:12.667
When you get out there, listen to the crowd.

29:12.743 --> 29:16.338
Talk to them, make it look like
you believe in what you're saying.

29:17.047 --> 29:19.709
I know we haven't exactly
always seen eye to eye...

29:19.783 --> 29:21.944
but this is very important.

29:22.019 --> 29:24.715
-I can't stress that enough.
-Alderman Gilliam?

29:25.389 --> 29:28.654
There's a Mitch Gilliam outside.
He says he's your brother.

29:29.326 --> 29:30.486
Send him in.

29:31.929 --> 29:35.797
Tonight, America will get
its first impressions of Mays Gilliam.

29:35.866 --> 29:38.562
You know what they say
about first impressions.

29:41.204 --> 29:44.571
Look at my little brother!
You said you'd call when you got here.

29:44.675 --> 29:47.576
I was trying to call you,
but l've been doing press all day.

29:47.644 --> 29:49.908
My little brother, running for President.

29:49.980 --> 29:53.074
Let me introduce you to Martin Geller,
Debra Lassiter.

29:53.216 --> 29:57.653
What's happening, baby? Thanks for what
you're doing for my brother. Appreciate it.

29:57.721 --> 29:59.586
How about you, thriller? What's going--

29:59.656 --> 30:02.284
Nice to meet you.
What do you do for a living?

30:03.560 --> 30:06.757
I'm a bail bondsman.
I got an office on the Southside.

30:06.830 --> 30:09.060
-Bail bondsman.
-Yes, sir.

30:15.639 --> 30:16.901
How's business?

30:16.974 --> 30:19.374
I tell you how business is.
Business is great.

30:19.443 --> 30:21.206
Thank God for crime.

30:23.380 --> 30:26.474
Thank God for crime.
Could you give us a minute?

30:28.018 --> 30:29.110
Five.

30:31.555 --> 30:33.216
Nice. Real nice.

30:33.724 --> 30:37.057
Look at you, man!
l see you all on the shows, politicking.

30:37.127 --> 30:39.561
You like the way your campaign is going?

30:39.629 --> 30:41.096
Look at this.

30:41.732 --> 30:45.429
Let me ask you something, brother.
When they gonna let you speak?

30:45.502 --> 30:48.096
I've been talking all day.
I was talking to the press.

30:48.171 --> 30:51.572
You been talking, but when they gonna
let you speak your mind?

30:51.641 --> 30:54.508
This ain't you. You gonna say this shit?
This shit is booty.

30:54.578 --> 30:58.378
Say this if you want to, watch that man
come sweep your butt off stage.

30:58.582 --> 31:02.109
Look at this poster: "Mays."
Who are they talking about? Willie?

31:02.486 --> 31:03.612
Let me tell you something.

31:03.687 --> 31:07.179
They're the everyday common folk,
working people. Laborers.

31:07.424 --> 31:09.449
Construction workers, nurses.

31:09.526 --> 31:11.994
Play the game
when you're working for them.

31:12.062 --> 31:14.860
This is your campaign.
You're supposed to be in charge.

31:17.834 --> 31:19.165
It's time.

31:20.103 --> 31:21.263
I got to go.

31:25.008 --> 31:28.171
I love you, man,
and l'm with you no matter what.

31:29.846 --> 31:32.440
-Go get them.
-I'll see you out there.

31:34.785 --> 31:35.979
Speak.

31:39.990 --> 31:43.517
Chicago, please welcome
your next president.:

31:43.727 --> 31:46.127
Alderman Mays Gilliam.

32:05.916 --> 32:07.941
What the hell is he doing?

32:12.155 --> 32:14.419
They had a speech written for me...

32:15.926 --> 32:17.894
about what the people need.

32:18.161 --> 32:20.356
But you guys are the people.

32:20.764 --> 32:22.095
You know what you need.

32:23.133 --> 32:24.464
Better schools...

32:25.435 --> 32:26.925
better jobs...

32:27.404 --> 32:28.928
Iess crime.

32:31.274 --> 32:34.004
How many of you, right now...

32:34.377 --> 32:39.076
work two jobs
just to have enough money to be broke?

32:39.783 --> 32:41.216
That ain't right.

32:42.052 --> 32:45.351
If you work two jobs,
and at the end of the week...

32:45.522 --> 32:48.923
you got just enough money
to get your broke ass home...

32:49.092 --> 32:51.390
Iet me hear you say, "That ain't right!"

32:51.561 --> 32:52.858
That ain't right!

32:54.798 --> 32:59.235
How many of you have children
that they call stupid?

32:59.736 --> 33:02.204
Don't be ashamed! lt ain't your fault.

33:02.272 --> 33:05.969
I asked my niece the other day,
"What's four plus four?" She said, "44."

33:06.676 --> 33:09.839
But that ain't her fault!
That's the school's fault.

33:10.413 --> 33:14.008
If your child's school has old-ass books...

33:14.084 --> 33:17.645
and brand-new metal detectors,
let me hear you say, "That ain't right!"

33:17.721 --> 33:19.279
That ain't right!

33:19.456 --> 33:20.650
It ain't right.

33:20.724 --> 33:25.491
And now we got these corporations
stealing all the money.

33:25.896 --> 33:28.592
They ain't stealing their money,
they stealing our money!

33:28.665 --> 33:29.893
The pension.

33:29.966 --> 33:31.991
You work for 35 years.

33:32.169 --> 33:36.162
You thought you'd leave your kids
a will, now you'll leave them a won't!

33:36.473 --> 33:39.909
You show up to get your pension,
they give you a pen!

33:40.343 --> 33:44.746
A damn pen! What in the hell
am l supposed to do with a pen?

33:44.915 --> 33:48.681
I should stab you in the neck
with this pen, Mr. Pension Taker.

33:48.852 --> 33:50.752
Get your hand out of my pocket!

33:50.987 --> 33:54.354
Taking everybody's pension,
and nobody going to jail.

33:54.424 --> 33:56.790
That's some bullshit. Ain't it?

33:56.927 --> 34:00.693
Meanwhile, we steal a Big Mac with cheese...

34:00.764 --> 34:02.857
next thing you know, we on Death Row!

34:02.933 --> 34:04.025
That ain't right!

34:08.271 --> 34:12.002
How many of you work in a city
you can't afford to live in?

34:13.176 --> 34:14.302
That ain't right!

34:15.145 --> 34:18.945
How many of you work in a mall
you can't afford to shop in?

34:19.014 --> 34:20.312
That ain't right!

34:20.483 --> 34:23.213
How many of you clean up a hotel...

34:23.286 --> 34:25.880
you ain't never gonna be able to stay in?

34:26.121 --> 34:27.453
That ain't right!

34:31.094 --> 34:36.031
We got nurses that work in hospitals
they can't even afford to get sick in.

34:37.667 --> 34:38.860
It ain't right!

34:42.371 --> 34:44.033
It isn't right!

34:45.408 --> 34:48.377
That shit is wrong!

34:50.513 --> 34:51.980
It's dead wrong!

34:56.319 --> 34:57.479
I'm Mays Gilliam...

34:57.554 --> 35:01.149
and l'm running for President
of the United States of America

35:10.667 --> 35:13.158
No questions. Sorry.

35:13.637 --> 35:15.127
Where's Mitch?

35:16.906 --> 35:20.865
Go to work. Handle your business.
If you need me, call me.

35:21.611 --> 35:22.771
I'll call you.

35:23.079 --> 35:27.140
Are you insane? You can't just go out
in front of 5,000 people and talk!

35:27.317 --> 35:30.844
And you said "shit."
Presidential candidates do not say "shit."

35:30.920 --> 35:34.549
Show me a man that's never said shit,
l'll show you someone full of shit!

35:34.624 --> 35:35.716
Debra, hold on.

35:36.293 --> 35:39.160
What you just did, that was great.

35:39.329 --> 35:42.264
Maybe you're right.
We could tailor the speeches more to you.

35:42.332 --> 35:43.629
My speeches?

35:43.700 --> 35:45.292
Come on, did you hear them?

35:45.368 --> 35:48.997
If this is gonna work, it's got to fit me.
It's got to be my campaign.

35:49.072 --> 35:50.505
This is not your campaign.

35:50.573 --> 35:53.906
You do what l tell you to,
or you'll be back in D.C. on your bicycle.

35:53.977 --> 35:56.172
I'm the one running for President.

35:56.246 --> 35:59.477
If we're gonna run this campaign,
it's got to go my way.

35:59.549 --> 36:01.574
We're gonna do it the way l want it done.

36:01.651 --> 36:04.313
Hold on.
I don't know if that's such a good idea

36:04.387 --> 36:07.083
If you don't know, you better ask somebody.

36:21.455 --> 36:24.788
After a slow start, Mays Gilliam
has made some dramatic changes...

36:24.858 --> 36:26.655
in his presidentiaI campaign.

36:36.270 --> 36:41.003
Hi. I'm Mays Gilliam,
candidate for President of the United States.

36:41.308 --> 36:43.208
This is my new headquarters.

36:43.277 --> 36:47.441
The individuaIs you see before you
will help me guide my campaign.

36:48.182 --> 36:50.343
These are my people.

36:52.987 --> 36:56.081
Mays Gilliam is turning the establishment
on its ear...

36:56.156 --> 36:58.556
with his new controversiaI campaign ads.

37:02.730 --> 37:07.064
Ifyou love America,
vote Mays Gilliam for President.

37:07.868 --> 37:10.564
Paid for by Citizens for Mays Gilliam.

37:24.852 --> 37:27.412
The part of Mays Gilliam's
security director...

37:27.488 --> 37:30.389
will now be played
by Muhammad Muhammad Muhammad.

37:31.992 --> 37:36.224
Childcare is one of the most important
issues facing this country today.

37:36.430 --> 37:39.331
The working mother
has to take her child to a nanny.

37:39.566 --> 37:42.399
The nanny has to take her child
to a babysitter.

37:42.469 --> 37:45.233
The babysitter
has to take her child to daycare.

37:45.305 --> 37:49.605
On the count of three, l want everybody
to take care of their own damn kids!

37:50.277 --> 37:53.838
Whose baby is this? lt ain't mine!

37:54.448 --> 37:59.044
Gay people want what every American
wants. A good house, a good job!

37:59.353 --> 38:02.345
I believe in gay rights
because when l see gay people...

38:02.423 --> 38:06.325
all l'm seeing are people,
normal people like every other American.

38:13.267 --> 38:17.033
Thank you for inviting me
to the Player's Ball!

38:20.340 --> 38:22.535
America needs to change its ways.

38:22.976 --> 38:26.935
I promise if l'm your President,
l will take care of everybody:

38:27.214 --> 38:31.617
Big business and small business,
show business and ho business.

38:44.398 --> 38:45.387
Hello, Debra

38:45.466 --> 38:46.455
Bill?

38:46.767 --> 38:49.998
I am in Detroit at a Player's Ball
with pimps and whores.

38:50.137 --> 38:52.002
Excuse me, hoes!

38:53.040 --> 38:56.237
I can't do this. You got to get me
out of here. I can't control him.

38:56.310 --> 38:57.800
He won't listen to me!

38:57.878 --> 39:01.405
No, Debra
I need you out there, and this is going great.

39:03.250 --> 39:04.911
This is what we wanted.

39:05.085 --> 39:07.246
I love this guy. "That ain't right."

39:07.387 --> 39:09.252
He really thinks he can make a difference.

39:09.323 --> 39:12.451
Stop worrying. This will work out fine. Bye.

39:14.862 --> 39:16.193
Don't l know you?

39:16.363 --> 39:17.455
No!

39:27.708 --> 39:31.576
He feels good
Things are going his way

39:32.446 --> 39:36.143
Hejust might be
The President someday

40:09.583 --> 40:13.280
Mays, darling, l've been thinking.
I want a small wedding.

40:13.353 --> 40:15.981
I think l want 150, maybe 200 people.

40:16.156 --> 40:18.522
I've always said
l wanted a wedding in a church...

40:18.592 --> 40:21.425
but lately l've been thinking about
the Botanical Gardens.

40:21.495 --> 40:24.020
We could do it by the tulips.
It'll be beautiful--

40:24.164 --> 40:25.495
Security!

40:40.167 --> 40:41.998
Who the hell is Mays Gilliam?

40:42.536 --> 40:44.128
He's running against you, sir.

40:44.305 --> 40:46.865
What happened to Gaines?

40:46.941 --> 40:48.408
He died in a plane crash.

40:49.176 --> 40:51.041
Get out of here! Gaines is dead?

40:51.212 --> 40:54.181
-Don't you remember? lt was on the news!
-Not my news.

40:55.516 --> 40:58.917
This fellow, Gilliam,
is an alderman from D.C.

40:59.487 --> 41:01.216
He took Gaines' place, sir.

41:01.288 --> 41:02.846
I'm running against this guy.

41:02.923 --> 41:03.855
Yes, sir.

41:05.025 --> 41:06.720
That is some bullshit.

41:07.027 --> 41:08.517
This is my time.

41:08.596 --> 41:10.928
I've been Vice President for eight years.

41:11.065 --> 41:14.762
I am a war hero,
and l am Sharon Stone's cousin!

41:15.302 --> 41:19.568
And l'll be damned if l'm going to let
my election be ruined by this asshole!

41:20.674 --> 41:24.337
I want this guy done. You hear me?
Finish him!

41:25.613 --> 41:27.911
He will be destroyed, sir, as you wish.

41:28.682 --> 41:32.140
This is the White House
without Mays Gilliam. Peaceful, isn't it?

41:32.286 --> 41:35.449
Now, this is the White House
if Gilliam is elected.

41:43.564 --> 41:46.032
Let's keep Mays Gilliam
out of the White House.

41:46.100 --> 41:49.035
Vote Brian Lewis for President.
It's your last chance.

41:50.671 --> 41:52.798
How do you want to handle this?

41:53.674 --> 41:55.608
I don't want to go negative.

41:56.844 --> 41:58.277
Nobody wants to hear that.

41:58.345 --> 42:01.246
I want people to vote for me,
not against Lewis.

42:01.348 --> 42:04.579
-People don't know what they want to hear.
-We have to respond.

42:04.652 --> 42:08.315
We should go with something measured,
accurate. Let's call him on his record!

42:08.389 --> 42:11.358
You can't challenge his record
when Mays doesn't have one.

42:11.425 --> 42:12.790
How about a massage?

42:14.662 --> 42:16.061
Ladies and gentlemen...

42:16.130 --> 42:20.123
please welcome
presidentiaI candidate Mays Gilliam.

42:31.512 --> 42:32.877
Thank you!

42:33.214 --> 42:36.513
This is Conservative Talk 520.
You're listening to Big Dave.

42:36.584 --> 42:40.281
Negative ads. Lewis is up, Gilliam is down.
I think it's great!

42:40.354 --> 42:41.343
Bottom line.:

42:41.422 --> 42:44.858
I don't think l want Gilliam
and his homies to be in the White House.

42:46.861 --> 42:50.797
People are saying these ads
are dirty politics. Give me a smaIl break!

42:50.865 --> 42:55.427
We're not taIking about running
a rib shack but a country!

42:55.569 --> 42:58.402
He's running for President
and every vote counts!

42:58.606 --> 43:01.404
Ladies and gentlemen, Mays Gilliam!

43:02.943 --> 43:06.572
And if these ads are so bad,
why hasn't Gilliam said anything?

43:07.047 --> 43:08.446
Howard Stern rocks!

43:08.616 --> 43:10.243
You're on with Big Dave.

43:10.317 --> 43:14.014
The reason Gilliam hasn't responded
is because he has too much integrity.

43:23.330 --> 43:26.925
We just got endorsements
from Raekwon the Chef...

43:27.134 --> 43:28.863
and Ghostface Killah.

43:29.303 --> 43:31.237
-Is this good?
-It's great.

43:33.207 --> 43:35.266
Where are we on this running mate thing?

43:35.643 --> 43:38.635
I've been making calls.
Nobody wants to run with you.

43:38.846 --> 43:40.245
Who did you call?

43:40.848 --> 43:42.372
Everybody.

43:42.783 --> 43:44.444
Did you call Hammer?

43:45.286 --> 43:47.777
No, l did not call Hammer.

43:49.456 --> 43:51.424
Then you didn't call everybody.

43:51.792 --> 43:53.987
Mr. Gilliam, can l have your autograph?

43:54.061 --> 43:55.358
I'll be right back.

43:58.098 --> 44:00.259
-Should we call Hammer?
-No.

44:01.969 --> 44:03.561
Say cheese!

44:03.804 --> 44:07.900
Mays Gilliam did not attend
this year's annuaI raIly against cancer.

44:09.076 --> 44:12.239
Is Mays Gilliam for cancer
or against cancer?

44:13.147 --> 44:15.877
Mays Gilliam, he's for cancer.

44:16.417 --> 44:20.251
Vote Brian Lewis for President.
It's your last chance.

44:22.089 --> 44:23.784
Cancer lover!

44:25.145 --> 44:28.046
No, he does not get away with this crap!

44:28.114 --> 44:30.639
This is what we'll do.
You ever watch Bugs Bunny?

44:30.717 --> 44:35.552
Bugs would always shoot Elmer Fudd
in the face and drop an anvil on his head.

44:35.722 --> 44:39.055
But what made Elmer really mad
is when Bugs Bunny kissed him.

44:39.159 --> 44:40.922
We got to kiss this bitch.

44:41.294 --> 44:43.762
-How do you propose we do that?
-Watch this.

44:43.930 --> 44:48.162
I'm a Klansman. I hate niggers, Jews,
and fags, but l love Brian Lewis.

44:49.269 --> 44:51.703
Yo, what's up? l'm Osama Bin Laden.

44:51.938 --> 44:54.668
I hate America, but l love Brian Lewis.

44:54.941 --> 44:57.034
Paid for by Osama Bin Laden.

44:57.744 --> 44:59.974
Sharon Stone is a defector.

45:00.046 --> 45:03.504
That's what Lewis campaign insiders
are saying about the Hollywood star...

45:03.583 --> 45:08.282
and cousin of Vice President Lewis,
after Stone's endorsement of Mays Gilliam.

45:08.354 --> 45:09.616
I don't believe it!

45:11.491 --> 45:12.480
Yeah!

45:14.327 --> 45:15.726
I know!

45:16.396 --> 45:18.057
Did you hear....

45:19.999 --> 45:21.296
What are you doing here?

45:21.367 --> 45:24.131
Gilliam is over 30 points.

45:25.238 --> 45:28.674
That means even if he loses
he's the frontrunner in 2008.

45:28.742 --> 45:31.802
In case you've forgotten,
l intend to run for President in 2008...

45:31.878 --> 45:33.709
and l am not running against him.

45:34.080 --> 45:37.140
So this is over.
Either you put a stop to it or l will.

45:37.250 --> 45:40.947
I came on board to run a campaign
for a man we didn't expect to win...

45:41.087 --> 45:43.146
not to sabotage him so he'd lose.

45:43.223 --> 45:46.750
You're in this as thick as l am.
Of course he's supposed to lose!

45:46.826 --> 45:48.259
That's why we picked him.

45:48.328 --> 45:50.762
Are you with me or are you with him?

45:50.830 --> 45:52.991
I thought you wanted
what was best for the party.

45:53.066 --> 45:54.693
I'm what's best for the party!

45:55.702 --> 45:57.067
What's the matter?

45:57.137 --> 46:00.368
Democracy doesn't work for you
when you're not winning?

46:02.008 --> 46:03.407
I'm with him.

46:10.850 --> 46:12.181
I'm with him?

46:21.294 --> 46:24.161
-Who are these people again?
-The Urban Business Board.

46:24.230 --> 46:27.290
-What are your plans for Social Security?
-Give it to old people.

46:27.367 --> 46:29.801
-Your plans on global warming?
-Global ice tea

46:29.869 --> 46:31.530
-You the man!
-You the woman!

46:34.107 --> 46:36.974
I want to introduce you
to Chester Norris Allen.

46:37.277 --> 46:41.509
He owns a bottling plant in D.C.
and l spoke to him about our problem.

46:41.581 --> 46:43.071
We've got a nice check for you.

46:43.149 --> 46:45.845
We can't take it. You sell malt liquor to kids.

46:45.919 --> 46:47.216
I do no such thing.

46:47.320 --> 46:51.518
Come on, man. It's orange beer
with a nipple top. Now, who's that for?

46:51.758 --> 46:53.419
It's Crib Malt Liquor, man!

46:53.593 --> 46:55.060
He's unbelievable!

46:55.728 --> 46:59.129
Damn it, we need that money!
Why do you make everything so difficult?

46:59.199 --> 47:01.190
It's Crib Malt Liquor!

47:01.701 --> 47:04.636
"Crib Malt Liquor,
just like Mama used to make"?

47:04.704 --> 47:06.262
Whose mama? Not my mama!

47:07.106 --> 47:10.974
The situation is getting tense with the threat
of the bus line being shut down.

47:11.044 --> 47:13.979
Protestors took their concerns
to transit officiaIs...

47:14.047 --> 47:18.040
but taIks broke down when the newly
appointed aIderman, ReginaId Shannon...

47:18.117 --> 47:20.847
was punched in the face
by an angry protestor.

47:23.456 --> 47:25.788
-Good evening, sir.
-What's up, Nikki?

47:25.859 --> 47:29.625
I noticed you weren't at the party,
so l thought...

47:30.263 --> 47:34.700
if there is anything you would like
for me to do, l would be happy to.

47:35.935 --> 47:37.425
Could l ask you something?

47:38.805 --> 47:39.999
Yes.

47:41.307 --> 47:43.673
You seem like a nice girl.

47:45.345 --> 47:47.506
How did you get into this line of work?

47:53.353 --> 47:55.878
I went to the University of Nebraska..

47:56.055 --> 47:59.024
where l majored
in Theater and Communications.

47:59.225 --> 48:02.626
I did some extra work,
and a few things that went straight to video.

48:06.933 --> 48:07.922
Okay.

48:08.434 --> 48:10.095
Can l ask you a question?

48:10.169 --> 48:11.397
Yeah, sure.

48:11.571 --> 48:15.974
Since l've been here, you haven't really
given me any assignments.

48:17.043 --> 48:19.477
I was wondering if you find me attractive.

48:23.683 --> 48:25.480
I think you're....

48:25.585 --> 48:28.452
I think you're very attractive. It's just that...

48:29.522 --> 48:34.152
I like to get to know people
before l get involved.

48:35.862 --> 48:38.524
I don't mean to be out of line, sir...

48:40.300 --> 48:41.289
but are you?

48:44.637 --> 48:46.002
Am l what?

48:46.072 --> 48:48.233
Trying to get to know somebody.

48:53.611 --> 48:57.012
-It is late, l'm out of here.
-You need to take a cab.

48:57.615 --> 48:59.674
I'll be fine. I'm just gonna walk.

49:06.090 --> 49:07.751
Take a cab!

49:08.726 --> 49:10.921
I'll be fine. I'll walk.

49:18.870 --> 49:19.996
Need a ride?

49:26.444 --> 49:27.968
Where are we going?

49:28.112 --> 49:30.444
I just thought l'd give you a little tour.

49:42.994 --> 49:46.430
If you look over there,
it's the Lincoln Memorial.

49:47.732 --> 49:49.359
Lincoln freed the slaves...

49:49.434 --> 49:53.268
but before he did it, he said,
"First you niggers got to build me a statue."

49:54.839 --> 49:57.774
Right there is the Jefferson Memorial.

49:57.842 --> 49:59.810
Jefferson had a black mistress.

49:59.877 --> 50:04.075
He said, "All men are created equal,
but black women got the nicest ass!"

50:06.417 --> 50:08.146
That's the Treasury.

50:08.319 --> 50:12.050
If you look real hard in the window,
you can see Oprah counting her money.

50:14.025 --> 50:17.119
$20 trillion one, $20 trillion two....

50:17.261 --> 50:18.319
Hi, Oprah!

50:24.535 --> 50:25.832
What's it like...

50:25.903 --> 50:29.964
traveling all over the country
and meeting all those people?

50:31.042 --> 50:34.273
I like it. I like traveling,
l like meeting the people.

50:34.345 --> 50:38.714
But sometimes, you don't know
if people like you for you.

50:38.816 --> 50:41.307
-Know what l mean?
-I like you for you.

50:43.454 --> 50:45.354
And l think you're okay.

50:45.690 --> 50:47.624
-Just okay?
-I'm just playing.

50:50.695 --> 50:52.754
I forgot how nice D.C. was.

50:54.265 --> 50:57.132
I'm always working.
I never get a chance to check it out.

50:57.201 --> 51:00.466
Maybe you need to take advantage
of what's in front of you.

51:00.538 --> 51:04.838
You never know, you may look up someday,
and it might not be there.

51:09.580 --> 51:10.672
Freeze!

51:11.015 --> 51:14.610
Put your hands up in the air
and step away from Mr. Gilliam!

51:14.685 --> 51:15.879
It's okay!

51:16.087 --> 51:18.851
-What the hell are you doing?
-What the hell are you doing?

51:18.923 --> 51:22.882
You can't go dashing off
in the middle of the night with some girl.

51:22.960 --> 51:25.622
Something's happened.
We got to pack and get out of here!

51:25.730 --> 51:28.221
Somebody make sure she gets home safely.

51:28.666 --> 51:30.759
We have a plane waiting for us.

51:36.707 --> 51:40.734
In Florida today, guns and explosives
were found at ajunior high school.

51:40.811 --> 51:44.747
No one was injured in the incident,
but with just six weeks till Election Day...

51:44.982 --> 51:47.473
this could be a hot-button issue
for both parties.

51:47.551 --> 51:50.645
Now, back to the Jay-Z song
aIready in progress.

51:52.189 --> 51:55.488
Muhammad, get me a gun
in case another kid tries to get crazy.

51:55.559 --> 51:59.222
This could work in our favor.
Florida is a big Second Amendment state.

51:59.296 --> 52:02.060
This is serious. This is not the Player's Ball.

52:02.132 --> 52:05.966
You can cut into Lewis' numbers.
Talk about the kids, not about the guns.

52:06.270 --> 52:08.500
If l get shot, everybody is fired.

52:09.039 --> 52:10.233
One question here.

52:10.307 --> 52:14.038
There's been an outcry that something
needs to be done about school violence.

52:14.111 --> 52:16.011
What do you plan to do about this?

52:16.079 --> 52:18.172
I feel we need to talk to our kids....

52:30.360 --> 52:31.349
Excuse me.

52:34.364 --> 52:35.729
Hello, children.

52:36.266 --> 52:37.528
Good morning.

52:39.403 --> 52:43.032
Pay attention.
This is going to be a class: Bullshit 101 .

52:43.106 --> 52:47.042
Ladies and gentlemen,
our American children are hurting today...

52:47.444 --> 52:49.742
and we need to reach out to them...

52:49.813 --> 52:52.577
and give them all
a good old-fashioned American hug.

52:54.651 --> 52:58.178
America is the greatest country
on the face of the earth...

52:58.722 --> 53:00.155
and l want to say:

53:00.657 --> 53:02.147
God bless America!

53:02.826 --> 53:04.384
And no place else.

53:04.561 --> 53:06.688
Thank you. Thank you, children.

53:06.763 --> 53:09.493
No more bombs now. And don't use guns.

53:10.300 --> 53:12.325
-That went well.
-Very touching.

53:12.402 --> 53:14.267
-The kids liked me.
-You were very genuine.

53:14.338 --> 53:15.930
They responded.

53:16.006 --> 53:19.169
I tried to hug a girl and a boy
so l wouldn't seem sexist.

53:19.943 --> 53:21.638
Mr. Vice President!

53:22.279 --> 53:24.213
Welcome to the show, Alderman Gilliam.

53:24.281 --> 53:26.613
Surprised you're not somewhere
with your girlfriend.

53:26.683 --> 53:27.843
How do you know about her?

53:27.918 --> 53:30.478
I'm the government. I know everything.

53:30.621 --> 53:32.088
We really should debate.

53:33.957 --> 53:35.857
Let's get something straight.

53:35.959 --> 53:38.689
I don't know you, and l don't like you.

53:39.563 --> 53:42.896
Party's over. I'm fixing to whip your ass.

53:43.667 --> 53:45.066
You got it?

53:49.273 --> 53:50.900
Sir, we really should debate.

53:52.576 --> 53:56.034
God bless America, and no place else.

54:00.493 --> 54:03.155
Sir, we just got this off the uplink.

54:03.396 --> 54:04.328
What is it?

54:04.397 --> 54:07.230
An off-the-record comment by Mays Gilliam.

54:07.400 --> 54:09.129
-Bad?
-Yes, sir.

54:09.736 --> 54:10.794
Good work.

54:17.443 --> 54:19.570
It's on! Guys, come here!

54:19.646 --> 54:23.013
...Lewis was on the scene
comforting parents and students.

54:23.850 --> 54:26.284
The press is in Lewis' back pocket.

54:27.020 --> 54:30.786
In this CNB News exclusive,
our cameras caught Gilliam...

54:31.024 --> 54:35.051
making what was arguably
the most controversiaI statement of the day.

54:35.295 --> 54:38.321
They act like us.
We're bombing countries aIl the time.

54:38.398 --> 54:40.525
If l was 12, l'd have a gun, too.

54:40.600 --> 54:41.828
Tell me you didn't say that.

54:41.935 --> 54:45.769
I didn't know the camera was on me.
I was playing around with some sound guy.

54:45.838 --> 54:48.170
You didn't know the camera was on you?

54:49.475 --> 54:53.571
Of course it's on you. It's always on you!
You're running for President!

54:53.646 --> 54:54.806
I told you....

54:54.881 --> 54:57.111
This is all your fault!

54:58.718 --> 55:01.949
Gilliam is under investigation by the FBl...

55:02.021 --> 55:03.921
for his involvement with this man...

55:04.123 --> 55:07.718
friend and associate
and accused drug lord, Warren Pryor.

55:07.794 --> 55:10.490
-Lord, we're going to jail.
-We're not going to jail.

55:10.596 --> 55:11.654
Is it true?

55:13.199 --> 55:14.359
What's up, Warren?

55:14.434 --> 55:17.528
I know him, but l don't drug-lord know him.

55:17.603 --> 55:21.699
It's just a guy l say "What's up?" to.
But l don't know him know him.

55:21.841 --> 55:25.106
Do you have drugs on you?
Get them off, l'm not going to jail for you.

55:25.178 --> 55:26.475
Are you on the pipe?

55:27.046 --> 55:29.105
This is messed up
This reaIly sucks

55:29.182 --> 55:31.548
Every time you're doing good
troublejust pops up

55:31.617 --> 55:33.881
He doesn't know what he's gonna do

55:36.489 --> 55:38.923
This is messed up
This reaIly sucks

55:38.992 --> 55:41.017
Keep your head up, it's your best bet

55:41.094 --> 55:43.221
Let's hope the election's not through

55:43.296 --> 55:47.596
If you see Mays Gilliam,
please do not call the authorities.

55:47.900 --> 55:51.631
Just do whatever you can
to make his life a living hell.

55:52.372 --> 55:53.464
No more questions!

55:53.539 --> 55:56.975
If l see Mays Gilliam,
l'll bust a cap in his ass.

55:57.043 --> 56:01.639
Gilliam is done
and Big Dave says, "Waa-waa!"

56:02.515 --> 56:03.709
Oh, God.

56:04.617 --> 56:06.278
What am l going to do?

56:07.186 --> 56:10.781
What are you worried about?
Your face isn't on the side of a bus.

56:10.857 --> 56:13.052
I'll be the one taking a hit for this.

56:13.126 --> 56:17.688
Get me on the news so l can apologize.
That's what the people want to hear.

56:17.930 --> 56:19.261
You're probably right.

56:19.332 --> 56:21.926
Make a statement of some kind,
try and sound sincere--

56:22.001 --> 56:23.696
Just give me a break!

56:24.570 --> 56:27.801
You think you can say you're sorry
and all of this will go away?

56:28.875 --> 56:33.141
Mays, you're running for President
of the United States of America

56:34.881 --> 56:38.476
Do you have any idea why they chose you?

56:41.888 --> 56:44.254
-We picked you because--
-Shut up!

56:49.162 --> 56:51.528
You're here to lose.

56:52.965 --> 56:55.490
Arnot picked you so you could lose.

56:56.269 --> 56:58.169
Think about it.

56:58.404 --> 57:01.601
If they had any idea
they could win this thing...

57:01.674 --> 57:05.405
do you think they would have chosen
an ignorant-ass nigger like you?

57:10.616 --> 57:11.913
Wait up.

57:12.351 --> 57:15.411
You're not calling me an ignorant nigger...

57:15.521 --> 57:18.081
and thinking you're staying on my bus.

57:19.358 --> 57:22.691
I am not getting off this bus.
We're in the middle of nowhere--

57:22.762 --> 57:25.390
Now you need a ride
from an ignorant nigger.

57:25.465 --> 57:27.296
I am not getting off this bus!

57:27.633 --> 57:28.657
Apologize.

57:29.202 --> 57:30.601
Security!

57:31.971 --> 57:33.529
Damn you, Mays Gilliam!

57:35.341 --> 57:37.502
You knew about this all along?

58:00.766 --> 58:03.394
Is there trouble
inside the Gilliam campaign?

58:03.469 --> 58:07.166
That's what Washington insiders
want to know after Gilliam's chief advisor...

58:07.240 --> 58:10.107
Debra Lassiter, left the campaign trail.

58:10.209 --> 58:12.643
Down in the polls,
Gilliam still has no running mate.

58:12.712 --> 58:15.306
Sources say
the Teamsters may endorse Lewis.

58:15.381 --> 58:18.009
Did Gilliam kill JonBenet Ramsay?
Police want to know.

58:18.084 --> 58:20.917
The big question.: Where is Mays Gilliam?

58:22.088 --> 58:25.080
I'll tell you where he's at.
He's with his peeps!

58:30.530 --> 58:32.293
-Hello?
-You up?

58:32.765 --> 58:35.598
I was hoping you'd call. Are you okay?

58:35.701 --> 58:38.226
I don't know. I guess l'm all right.

58:38.838 --> 58:41.033
Come on, talk to Mama

58:41.474 --> 58:44.102
I don't know.
It seems like they're trying to get me.

58:44.177 --> 58:47.169
Everywhere l turn,
they're trying to put a foot in my ass.

58:47.246 --> 58:50.613
After what you said,
you need a foot put up in your ass.

58:50.716 --> 58:53.879
What did you expect?
They would just make you President?

58:54.520 --> 58:56.852
They take a poll for everything l do.

58:57.390 --> 59:02.123
You ever been to a horserace?
My dad used to take me when l was little.

59:02.962 --> 59:05.362
The horses wear blinders.

59:06.065 --> 59:09.660
They don't even see each other.
They just run their race.

59:10.203 --> 59:13.604
So don't worry about Lewis,
don't worry about the press...

59:13.706 --> 59:15.731
just run your race.

59:15.975 --> 59:17.567
Let me ask you something.

59:17.677 --> 59:18.701
Okay.

59:19.312 --> 59:20.802
What are you wearing?

59:21.247 --> 59:23.215
Now, you know you need to stop.

59:31.011 --> 59:33.275
Man, news travels fast.

59:33.647 --> 59:37.549
Not 10 minutes after you fired me,
l had two offers for jobs.

59:37.618 --> 59:38.710
Good offers.

59:38.786 --> 59:40.185
What are you doing here?

59:40.487 --> 59:43.945
I know you got no reason to trust me,
but l'm asking you to.

59:44.291 --> 59:46.350
You've got five weeks left.

59:46.427 --> 59:49.396
I know Lassiter is out, but l think...

59:50.197 --> 59:52.665
I can help you do this.

59:52.733 --> 59:54.394
I want to help you.

59:56.603 --> 59:58.594
And l'm sorry, Mays.

59:59.173 --> 01:00:01.232
I don't know what else to say...

01:00:01.475 --> 01:00:04.672
but as bad as things look,
l don't think you should quit.

01:00:05.612 --> 01:00:07.409
Who said l was quitting?

01:00:07.881 --> 01:00:09.473
I wish l could quit.

01:00:09.650 --> 01:00:11.311
I wish it was that easy.

01:00:12.486 --> 01:00:14.010
You're lucky.

01:00:14.521 --> 01:00:17.684
You are so lucky.
You don't know how good you got it.

01:00:17.958 --> 01:00:19.858
You just represent yourself.

01:00:19.927 --> 01:00:21.053
Me?

01:00:22.029 --> 01:00:24.088
I represent my whole race.

01:00:24.832 --> 01:00:26.265
If l quit...

01:00:26.333 --> 01:00:29.564
there won't be another black candidate
for 50 years.

01:00:31.672 --> 01:00:32.798
All right.

01:00:34.541 --> 01:00:38.375
We can get rid of the school thing
with a statement that will blow things over.

01:00:38.545 --> 01:00:39.944
But we need a running mate.

01:00:40.013 --> 01:00:42.743
Who am l supposed to pick?
Nobody wants to run with me.

01:00:42.816 --> 01:00:44.875
We need somebody we can trust.

01:00:47.421 --> 01:00:48.820
Who do you trust?

01:00:50.891 --> 01:00:52.984
In the midst of his own Cinderella story...

01:00:53.060 --> 01:00:55.995
presidentiaI candidate
Gilliam is shaking it up.

01:00:56.063 --> 01:00:58.759
He's chosen his brother, Mitch Gilliam...

01:00:58.832 --> 01:01:01.960
a bail bondsman from Chicago,
as his running mate.

01:01:02.402 --> 01:01:05.667
PoliticaI anaIysts say this may be
too little, too late.

01:01:05.739 --> 01:01:07.866
Hi, l'm with the Pork Commission--

01:01:08.041 --> 01:01:10.566
I'm from the Athlete's Foot--

01:01:11.845 --> 01:01:12.971
Brother!

01:01:13.147 --> 01:01:15.707
Can you get my demo tape to somebody--

01:01:25.159 --> 01:01:26.387
Are these your bags?

01:01:26.460 --> 01:01:29.088
Look at my shoes and at the bags.
Shut up and follow me.

01:01:31.098 --> 01:01:32.565
Back up.

01:01:39.406 --> 01:01:42.773
What do you have to say about
your brother's controversial comments?

01:01:42.943 --> 01:01:46.606
My gosh, lady,
my brother said he was sorry. Let it go.

01:01:46.780 --> 01:01:48.941
See, that's why nobody like your ass.

01:01:50.951 --> 01:01:53.749
We got work to do.
We way behind in the polls.

01:01:53.821 --> 01:01:55.755
-Am l getting paid for this?
-Yeah.

01:01:56.924 --> 01:02:00.382
You're running for the vice presidency.
You're a bail bondsman.

01:02:00.460 --> 01:02:04.726
You have no Washington experience,
no political experience or connections.

01:02:04.798 --> 01:02:08.734
How does being a bail bondsman
qualify you to be Vice President?

01:02:09.503 --> 01:02:11.027
I am a bail bondsman.

01:02:11.171 --> 01:02:13.867
People come to me when they in trouble,
like the USa

01:02:13.941 --> 01:02:16.535
We bail people out. We bail out Mexico...

01:02:16.610 --> 01:02:19.477
the savings and loan, the airline industry.

01:02:19.646 --> 01:02:22.979
Now you ask me, sir,
what qualify me to run for Vice President.

01:02:23.050 --> 01:02:25.541
When the country is in trouble,
l'll bail them out.

01:02:25.619 --> 01:02:28.213
Hold that thought.
We have a caller from Detroit.

01:02:28.288 --> 01:02:32.691
Mitch! Why you looking around?
lt's Reggie.... Where my money at?

01:02:32.759 --> 01:02:35.557
Don't call me with that bullshit!
You see l'm on TV.

01:02:35.629 --> 01:02:37.221
What about NATO?

01:02:37.297 --> 01:02:40.858
I never met Nato.
I don't talk about people behind their back.

01:02:40.934 --> 01:02:43.459
NATO is the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization.

01:02:43.904 --> 01:02:46.873
I thought you were talking about
this guy named Nato.

01:02:46.940 --> 01:02:48.931
But you have to know these things.

01:02:49.042 --> 01:02:51.135
Do you know Nato Jacobs?

01:02:51.311 --> 01:02:54.371
Do you know Nato Jacobs?

01:02:54.581 --> 01:02:56.310
I'm sorry, l haven't met the gentleman.

01:02:56.383 --> 01:02:57.850
That's what l said.

01:02:57.918 --> 01:03:01.115
You know nothing about Nato?
l know nothing about NATO.

01:03:01.355 --> 01:03:04.722
Why are you out here
since inmates don't have the right to vote?

01:03:04.791 --> 01:03:07.658
It's not about the vote.
We're looking out for the convicts.

01:03:07.728 --> 01:03:10.754
We want to make sure
when they get out that they stay out.

01:03:10.831 --> 01:03:14.528
The better the education,
they become more productive citizens.

01:03:14.701 --> 01:03:16.225
Mitch! What's up?

01:03:16.303 --> 01:03:17.429
Shorty G!

01:03:17.504 --> 01:03:19.233
It's good to see you, boy!

01:03:19.306 --> 01:03:23.140
This is Shorty G. I arrested his ass.
I thought you got the chair, boy.

01:03:23.243 --> 01:03:26.644
Mr. Gilliam, how would you deaI
with white-collar crime?

01:03:26.947 --> 01:03:29.472
There's no such thing as white-collar crime.

01:03:29.650 --> 01:03:31.880
And there's no such thing
as black-on-black crime.

01:03:31.985 --> 01:03:33.179
Crime is crime.

01:03:33.253 --> 01:03:36.882
I don't care if you have a white collar
or a tank top.

01:03:37.124 --> 01:03:39.786
If you rob me, l'll whup your ass.

01:03:41.379 --> 01:03:45.509
I'm Janet Silvers reporting live in D.C.,
where transit operators....

01:03:45.583 --> 01:03:48.575
-I wish we'd get into the White House.
-To have a cookout?

01:03:48.653 --> 01:03:50.780
They were just talking about your ward.

01:03:50.855 --> 01:03:52.152
What's going on down there?

01:03:52.223 --> 01:03:56.125
They want to cut bus service
until they finish construction. I should go.

01:03:56.194 --> 01:03:59.163
-So you can blow up the bus line?
-One thing at a time.

01:03:59.230 --> 01:04:03.064
The Teamsters haven't endorsed Lewis yet.
Our numbers are going up.

01:04:03.134 --> 01:04:06.467
If we want a real shot at this thing,
we got to get Lewis to debate.

01:04:06.537 --> 01:04:08.437
He knows that. That's why he won't.

01:04:08.506 --> 01:04:10.633
He's avoiding me
like he owes me child support.

01:04:10.708 --> 01:04:13.836
He is scared. He's holding the ball,
hoping the clock will run out.

01:04:13.911 --> 01:04:16.846
That's a punk move.
Ducking and hiding like a little bitch!

01:04:16.948 --> 01:04:20.440
That may be, but he won't debate you
because you call him a little bitch.

01:04:23.254 --> 01:04:25.586
What this community needs--

01:04:25.656 --> 01:04:28.625
Is for you to debate me right now!

01:04:28.693 --> 01:04:30.126
Tell the people that!

01:04:30.194 --> 01:04:32.628
I thought l told you that we won't stop.

01:04:32.797 --> 01:04:34.196
Now, my agenda--

01:04:34.265 --> 01:04:35.789
I'll tell you about our agenda

01:04:35.867 --> 01:04:37.562
It's to have a debate right now!

01:04:37.635 --> 01:04:40.297
Get rid of this zero and talk to the hero.

01:04:42.573 --> 01:04:44.803
You got time to jog, but not to debate?

01:04:44.876 --> 01:04:46.366
You can run, but you can't hide.

01:04:46.444 --> 01:04:48.105
I thought l told you we won't stop.

01:04:48.813 --> 01:04:51.748
What you looking for, the news?
The news is we want to debate!

01:04:52.216 --> 01:04:54.776
-Why did you change the channel?
-He's scared!

01:04:55.787 --> 01:04:58.051
-A word from our sponsor.
-We want to debate!

01:04:58.122 --> 01:05:01.285
I thought l told you that we won't stop.

01:05:04.328 --> 01:05:05.454
Yo, Lewis!

01:05:05.630 --> 01:05:09.396
Your mother's ass is so big,
when she sits down she's three feet taIler.

01:05:09.934 --> 01:05:13.062
Yo, Lewis!
Your mother's got a reaIly big ass!

01:05:13.137 --> 01:05:15.731
Sir, it's time we prepare for a debate.

01:05:15.807 --> 01:05:18.605
Give me one good reason
l should debate that jerk.

01:05:18.676 --> 01:05:21.304
-He talked about your mother!
-So what?

01:05:22.580 --> 01:05:25.981
Are you going to just let him
talk about me like that?

01:05:30.955 --> 01:05:34.891
After some inventive chiding
on the part of Alderman Mays Gilliam...

01:05:34.959 --> 01:05:38.656
Vice President Lewis
has finally agreed to one debate...

01:05:38.996 --> 01:05:41.328
the night before the election.

01:05:42.733 --> 01:05:45.293
So, baby brother, this is it. You ready?

01:05:46.304 --> 01:05:47.862
All right, l guess.

01:05:47.939 --> 01:05:50.737
You guess? You don't know?
You either ready or you ain't.

01:05:51.542 --> 01:05:54.033
What's your problem? l'm ready, okay?

01:05:54.345 --> 01:05:58.406
No, you ain't. Look at you.
If you call this ready, this won't get it.

01:05:58.483 --> 01:06:01.316
Dress for the job you want,
not for the job you got.

01:06:01.385 --> 01:06:03.114
You ain't talking about my clothes.

01:06:03.187 --> 01:06:05.246
Come on now. This ain't about me.

01:06:05.389 --> 01:06:09.155
If l got a good idea, it shouldn't matter
what the hell l'm wearing!

01:06:09.994 --> 01:06:11.825
You know you messed up, man.

01:06:12.563 --> 01:06:14.190
I'm telling you right now.

01:06:14.465 --> 01:06:16.456
You know, this ain't about me!

01:06:19.370 --> 01:06:21.463
Lewis ain't no punk. He ain't no joke.

01:06:21.639 --> 01:06:24.437
That man has been Vice President
for eight years.

01:06:24.842 --> 01:06:27.333
He's a war hero.
He's Sharon Stone's cousin.

01:06:27.411 --> 01:06:28.878
You better come correct.

01:06:30.081 --> 01:06:32.379
Yeah? Well, l got us this far!

01:06:33.918 --> 01:06:36.045
This is as far as you're going to get!

01:06:36.554 --> 01:06:39.045
-It's like that?
-That's the way it is.

01:06:39.157 --> 01:06:41.421
Geller and them up there
pumping your head up.

01:06:41.492 --> 01:06:43.653
But Lewis will smack it back down!

01:07:03.948 --> 01:07:05.415
Oh, my God.

01:07:05.917 --> 01:07:07.612
Little brother, you all right?

01:07:11.556 --> 01:07:13.251
That's what your ass get.

01:07:13.324 --> 01:07:16.225
You need anything?
Because it look like you need some help.

01:07:16.294 --> 01:07:18.592
You gonna get yours! l'll tell Ma!

01:07:18.663 --> 01:07:19.925
You better not tell!

01:07:26.170 --> 01:07:27.137
Hello?

01:07:29.006 --> 01:07:33.773
Don't intrude in my life anymore. I don't
want to have anything to do with you...

01:07:33.844 --> 01:07:35.471
not after the way you treated me.

01:07:35.546 --> 01:07:38.947
I'm sorry l threw you off the bus.
It was wrong.

01:07:39.016 --> 01:07:41.348
I couldn't take what you were saying.

01:07:41.419 --> 01:07:42.716
What do you want?

01:07:43.521 --> 01:07:44.818
I want to win.

01:07:52.729 --> 01:07:56.722
Welcome to New York City
for the 2004 Presidential Debates.

01:07:57.434 --> 01:07:58.492
Where is he?

01:07:58.568 --> 01:08:00.729
He was right behind me.
Should l look for him?

01:08:00.804 --> 01:08:03.204
-They're getting nervous.
-We've got to do something.

01:08:03.273 --> 01:08:04.934
-I can do something.
-No!

01:08:05.475 --> 01:08:09.775
Ladies and gentlemen,
Vice President Brian Lewis.

01:08:21.158 --> 01:08:23.319
Wait. Here they come.

01:08:25.729 --> 01:08:26.889
Sweet.

01:08:27.898 --> 01:08:29.421
Hello, Martin.

01:08:29.666 --> 01:08:32.260
Sorry l'm late. I had to change.

01:08:32.335 --> 01:08:35.429
-Mr. Earl, nice to see you.
-Nice to see you too, sir.

01:08:35.538 --> 01:08:36.801
Let's move.

01:08:38.875 --> 01:08:42.537
There are 250 million people out there
deciding who to vote for.

01:08:42.612 --> 01:08:45.706
They all know Lewis
didn't want to debate you. Show them why.

01:08:45.782 --> 01:08:48.683
-Stay focused.
-Take your time.

01:08:48.785 --> 01:08:51.720
If he get out of pocket,
put your foot in his ass.

01:08:51.888 --> 01:08:53.651
By the way, nice suit.

01:08:55.258 --> 01:08:57.419
-"Fuh-buh"?
-Fubu.

01:08:57.493 --> 01:08:59.121
Even l knew that.

01:09:00.630 --> 01:09:04.532
Ladies and gentlemen,
Alderman Mays Gilliam.

01:09:17.147 --> 01:09:19.444
Yo, when's Martin coming on, man?

01:09:22.051 --> 01:09:24.145
My momma told me to whup your ass.

01:09:29.392 --> 01:09:34.091
The first question is directed
by coin flip to the Vice President.

01:09:34.698 --> 01:09:36.461
Vice President Lewis...

01:09:36.566 --> 01:09:39.261
what steps should be taken
to limit our youth's access...

01:09:39.336 --> 01:09:41.064
to violent materials?

01:09:41.136 --> 01:09:44.368
Our American children's futures
are at stake here.

01:09:45.008 --> 01:09:49.171
We need to study this issue,
and appropriate legislation...

01:09:49.246 --> 01:09:52.443
that will return us to an America
we can be proud of.

01:09:53.283 --> 01:09:55.911
God bless America, and no place else.

01:10:00.857 --> 01:10:04.054
Alderman Gilliam, same question, please.

01:10:04.127 --> 01:10:06.925
How do we limit violent material? Turn it off.

01:10:07.197 --> 01:10:10.030
And if the kids cut it back on,
knock them out.

01:10:10.133 --> 01:10:11.566
That's why l don't smoke.

01:10:11.635 --> 01:10:14.035
When l was a kid,
my daddy caught me smoking...

01:10:14.104 --> 01:10:15.662
and he knocked me out!

01:10:15.839 --> 01:10:19.240
And to this day, l don't smoke.
Not because l'm scared of cancer.

01:10:19.309 --> 01:10:22.801
I don't smoke because l think my dad
is going to walk through that door...

01:10:22.879 --> 01:10:24.904
and knock me the hell out!

01:10:25.282 --> 01:10:27.409
Knock out your kids. It helps.

01:10:36.493 --> 01:10:38.120
Vice President Lewis...

01:10:38.228 --> 01:10:42.096
with over 10,000 gun deaths per year
in the United States...

01:10:42.632 --> 01:10:45.328
do you believe we need
stricter gun control laws?

01:10:45.435 --> 01:10:47.596
I don't think we need more gun control.

01:10:47.671 --> 01:10:50.765
I say we enforce the laws
that are already on the books.

01:10:50.840 --> 01:10:53.673
The problem is, nobody reads the books.

01:10:53.743 --> 01:10:56.769
We need to start putting laws on videos...

01:10:56.846 --> 01:10:59.974
because everybody watches videos,
MTV, BET.

01:11:00.050 --> 01:11:02.610
We need to put some laws
on the Nelly video.

01:11:02.886 --> 01:11:07.755
If you had laws on a Destiny's Child video
right now, you could stop crime.

01:11:07.824 --> 01:11:11.385
-We already have gun licensing.
-But that's only to carry the gun.

01:11:11.461 --> 01:11:12.985
Let the people decide.

01:11:13.096 --> 01:11:16.657
The people can't decide. The people
are too busy getting shot in the ass.

01:11:36.386 --> 01:11:37.614
That's my brother.

01:11:37.687 --> 01:11:40.417
That's another reason he's not qualified.

01:11:40.557 --> 01:11:44.152
Because l had the good sense to pick
my big brother to be my running mate?

01:11:44.327 --> 01:11:46.386
I didn't come here to argue with you.

01:11:46.463 --> 01:11:50.092
Yes, you did. We're having a debate.
A debate ain't nothing but an argument.

01:11:50.166 --> 01:11:51.827
A debate isn't an argument.

01:11:52.002 --> 01:11:54.163
-Yes, it is.
-No, it isn't.

01:11:54.904 --> 01:11:57.099
-Yes, it is.
-No, it isn't.

01:11:57.774 --> 01:11:59.867
I know you are, but what am l?

01:12:07.017 --> 01:12:09.577
Can we just move on? This is ridiculous.

01:12:09.652 --> 01:12:10.983
Our next question comes from--

01:12:11.054 --> 01:12:12.180
I have a question.

01:12:12.789 --> 01:12:16.384
Would you like our reception
to be buffet style or formal seating?

01:12:16.493 --> 01:12:18.518
If you put Robert next to Nelson...

01:12:18.595 --> 01:12:21.689
he'll be very angry
because he wanted to be your best man.

01:12:21.765 --> 01:12:23.596
Security.

01:12:23.666 --> 01:12:25.190
I love you so much--

01:12:26.569 --> 01:12:29.367
The candidates have agreed upon
a short closing speech.

01:12:29.439 --> 01:12:32.533
Vice President Lewis won the coin toss.

01:12:32.609 --> 01:12:34.270
He has elected to go first.

01:12:34.444 --> 01:12:35.706
Thank you.

01:12:36.679 --> 01:12:38.738
-No, it isn't.
-Yes, it is!

01:12:39.215 --> 01:12:42.742
Tonight you have seen two different men...

01:12:42.919 --> 01:12:46.719
with two very different points of view,
battle to win your vote.

01:12:47.524 --> 01:12:49.958
And this is what America is all about.

01:12:51.027 --> 01:12:52.824
As we've seen tonight...

01:12:52.962 --> 01:12:57.456
Alderman Gilliam
can be captivating and entertaining.

01:12:58.301 --> 01:13:01.828
But America needs more than that
from its Commander in Chief.

01:13:02.205 --> 01:13:05.231
To lead America, it takes experience.

01:13:05.542 --> 01:13:08.943
Now, l've been Vice President
for the last eight years.

01:13:09.579 --> 01:13:13.481
I'm a war hero,
and l'm Sharon Stone's cousin.

01:13:14.884 --> 01:13:18.820
And to me,
America is like a fine performance car.

01:13:19.556 --> 01:13:22.150
And now is not the time...

01:13:22.659 --> 01:13:25.560
to turn this fine vehicle we call America..

01:13:26.029 --> 01:13:28.463
over to the hands of an amateur.

01:13:31.401 --> 01:13:35.098
I'm Brian Lewis, and l am your last chance.

01:13:36.106 --> 01:13:39.200
God bless America, and no place else.

01:13:44.247 --> 01:13:46.738
Yeah, it's over now.

01:13:47.784 --> 01:13:49.649
Why do you have to be so negative?

01:13:50.620 --> 01:13:51.882
Give me five.

01:13:51.955 --> 01:13:53.183
Thank you.

01:13:55.525 --> 01:13:56.856
Hold it!

01:14:08.438 --> 01:14:11.737
You're right, Vice President Lewis.
I am an amateur.

01:14:12.275 --> 01:14:14.436
When it comes to creating
so many enemies...

01:14:14.511 --> 01:14:18.709
that we need billions of dollars
to protect ourselves, l'm an amateur.

01:14:18.815 --> 01:14:21.682
When it comes to paying farmers
not to grow food...

01:14:21.751 --> 01:14:25.209
while people in this country
starve every day, l'm an amateur.

01:14:25.288 --> 01:14:29.452
When it comes to creating a drug policy
that makes crack and heroin...

01:14:29.526 --> 01:14:33.018
cheaper than asthma and AIDS medicine,
l'm an amateur.

01:14:33.096 --> 01:14:35.496
But there's nothing wrong
with being an amateur.

01:14:35.565 --> 01:14:38.898
The people that started
the Underground Railroad were amateurs.

01:14:38.968 --> 01:14:41.402
Martin Luther King was an amateur.

01:14:41.804 --> 01:14:44.398
Have you ever been to Amateur Night
at the Apollo?

01:14:44.474 --> 01:14:46.669
Some of the world's best talent was there:

01:14:46.743 --> 01:14:51.237
James Brown, Luther Vandross, Rockwell,
the Crown Heights Affair.

01:14:51.314 --> 01:14:54.147
-Hall and Oates!
-The Fat Boys, Rob Base.

01:14:54.217 --> 01:14:56.685
But you wouldn't know
nothing about that. Why?

01:14:56.753 --> 01:14:59.551
Because when it comes to judging
talent and potential...

01:14:59.622 --> 01:15:01.886
you, my friend, are an amateur!

01:15:07.497 --> 01:15:11.934
-I believe the Alderman is over his time.
-You had eight years to talk.

01:15:12.001 --> 01:15:15.266
Now it's my turn. I'm getting mine!

01:15:17.473 --> 01:15:19.964
Ladies and gentlemen,
hold your applause, please.

01:15:20.043 --> 01:15:22.773
How can you help the poor
if you never been poor?

01:15:22.845 --> 01:15:26.303
How can you stop crime
if you don't know no criminals?

01:15:26.382 --> 01:15:30.876
How can you make drug policy
if you never smoked a chronic?

01:15:31.854 --> 01:15:34.550
How can you do that? Just a nickel bag!

01:15:35.158 --> 01:15:36.921
I'm a real American.

01:15:36.993 --> 01:15:41.089
I've been high, l've been robbed,
l've been broke.

01:15:41.197 --> 01:15:45.657
My credit is horrible!
They won't even take my cash!

01:15:46.202 --> 01:15:50.332
You're always talking about,
"God bless America, and no place else."

01:15:50.406 --> 01:15:53.170
But isn't it obvious
that God has blessed America?

01:15:53.243 --> 01:15:56.838
America is the richest,
most powerful nation on earth.

01:15:57.247 --> 01:16:01.581
If America was a woman,
it would be a big-titty woman.

01:16:01.651 --> 01:16:04.279
And everybody loves a big-titty woman!

01:16:04.687 --> 01:16:06.314
So, in closing...

01:16:06.389 --> 01:16:09.085
I'd like to say you are full of shit.

01:16:10.593 --> 01:16:13.391
"God bless America, and no place else."

01:16:13.463 --> 01:16:16.955
How about "God bless Haiti"
or "God bless Africa"?

01:16:17.033 --> 01:16:18.864
How about "God bless Jamaica"?

01:16:18.935 --> 01:16:22.530
I'm not talking about Jamaica,
the beach tribes you all love.

01:16:22.605 --> 01:16:26.473
I'm talking about stabbing Jamaica
That's what l'm talking about.

01:16:26.542 --> 01:16:31.445
So, tonight l want to say:
"God bless America, and everybody else!"

01:16:31.948 --> 01:16:34.143
The whole world! God bless you!

01:16:34.217 --> 01:16:38.711
I'm Mays Gilliam, and l'm running for
President of the United States of America

01:16:38.888 --> 01:16:40.116
Ya heard?

01:17:02.745 --> 01:17:04.713
Now we can watch Martin!

01:17:17.948 --> 01:17:20.974
-Hello?
-Good morning, Mr. President.

01:17:22.619 --> 01:17:25.918
-What time is it?
-I think it's a little after 7:00.

01:17:26.256 --> 01:17:29.748
-Lisa, l need some help in here!
-Will you wait a damn minute?

01:17:30.093 --> 01:17:33.290
I was so proud ofyou.
You were so good last night.

01:17:35.565 --> 01:17:39.899
Tonight, no matter what, win or lose,
l want to see you.

01:17:39.970 --> 01:17:42.200
I don't know. I might have to work.

01:17:42.272 --> 01:17:44.797
But if l don't see you tonight,
l will see you soon.

01:17:44.874 --> 01:17:49.004
Just run your race, get out there,
and do what you got to do, okay?

01:17:49.179 --> 01:17:51.943
-I'll talk to you later. Bye.
-All right.

01:17:52.482 --> 01:17:55.918
It's Election Day, Tuesday,
November 8, 2004.

01:17:55.986 --> 01:17:57.851
The stage is set for what will be...

01:17:57.921 --> 01:18:00.788
one of the most dramatic campaign finaIes
of aIl time.

01:18:00.857 --> 01:18:04.452
The question everyone's asking is.:
"Who will America vote for?"

01:18:05.128 --> 01:18:06.755
I voted for Mays Gilliam.

01:18:06.830 --> 01:18:09.526
-I voted for big business.
-I voted for Lewis.

01:18:09.633 --> 01:18:12.261
Who the fuck you think l'm voting for?

01:18:12.702 --> 01:18:14.499
There seems to be an agreement...

01:18:14.571 --> 01:18:17.972
between Washington, D.C., officiaIs
and transit authority operators...

01:18:18.041 --> 01:18:20.737
regarding the shutdown
of the 9th Ward bus line.

01:18:20.810 --> 01:18:23.472
I don't see how they could do this to us.

01:18:23.546 --> 01:18:26.879
People got to make money and get to work.

01:18:27.417 --> 01:18:32.354
-Show them how you do it.
-The roof, the roof, the roof is on fire

01:18:32.422 --> 01:18:35.653
You're not gonna believe this.
We got the Teamsters!

01:18:35.725 --> 01:18:39.456
-That's great, little brother!
-They'll announce it at a press conference.

01:18:39.529 --> 01:18:42.157
You just have to go,
shake hands, take photographs...

01:18:42.232 --> 01:18:43.995
but it is yours.

01:18:46.403 --> 01:18:47.529
What's the matter?

01:18:47.604 --> 01:18:51.404
If they shut down this bus service,
l will drive you to work myself.

01:18:52.475 --> 01:18:55.103
-I can't do it.
-But it's Election Day!

01:18:55.178 --> 01:18:58.011
You have to get the endorsement.
You said you want to win.

01:18:58.081 --> 01:19:01.175
You can't snub the Teamsters.
You want them to endorse Lewis?

01:19:01.251 --> 01:19:04.015
I'm not worried about Lewis.
I'm running my race.

01:19:04.087 --> 01:19:06.555
Go ahead, baby brother. I got this.

01:19:08.558 --> 01:19:11.356
-You're just gonna let him go?
-He's a grown man.

01:19:11.428 --> 01:19:15.262
They shut down the whole bus line.
What can he do about that?

01:19:24.107 --> 01:19:28.407
In the latest exit poll, Vice President Lewis
has 51 percent of the vote.

01:19:28.478 --> 01:19:30.173
Bring him back. He got to vote.

01:19:30.246 --> 01:19:33.738
...while Mays Gilliam
is posting an impressive 47 percent.

01:19:34.984 --> 01:19:37.111
You gotta get to the back of the bus.

01:19:37.187 --> 01:19:38.950
I'm just playing. Come on.

01:19:39.322 --> 01:19:43.224
Now, he and Vice President Lewis
are in a statisticaI dead heat.

01:19:43.293 --> 01:19:44.783
Come on, hoes!

01:19:44.894 --> 01:19:49.092
While Lewis and Mitch Gilliam
have been working the campaign trail...

01:19:49.365 --> 01:19:52.493
Mays Gilliam has been out
driving people to work.

01:19:54.904 --> 01:19:57.873
Damn it! Why didn't somebody around here
think of this?

01:19:57.941 --> 01:20:00.466
Why am l not out there driving a damn bus?

01:20:00.543 --> 01:20:03.842
Get me an SUV, a minivan, a bus,
a scooter...

01:20:03.913 --> 01:20:06.006
a motorcycle, or a rickshaw.

01:20:06.082 --> 01:20:07.549
Get me some wheels, bitch!

01:20:08.918 --> 01:20:10.715
Are you going uptown?

01:20:11.988 --> 01:20:13.853
Come on. Wait a minute!

01:20:15.158 --> 01:20:17.285
We could write our own vows!

01:20:18.161 --> 01:20:21.062
I love you, Mays!

01:20:22.499 --> 01:20:26.060
With the polls about 30 minutes
from closing on the East Coast...

01:20:26.136 --> 01:20:29.799
Mays Gilliam is actually ahead
by several points.

01:20:32.408 --> 01:20:34.968
There is no question that Lewis has Texas.

01:20:36.780 --> 01:20:40.079
It seems clear
Gilliam is going to take New York.

01:20:44.454 --> 01:20:45.443
New York!

01:20:45.522 --> 01:20:47.581
It's likely Lewis will take Michigan.

01:20:49.425 --> 01:20:53.361
It looks like Gilliam
might just pull an upset in Illinois.

01:20:55.165 --> 01:20:56.632
Illinois!

01:20:57.634 --> 01:20:58.601
Go, Mays!

01:20:58.668 --> 01:21:01.364
This looks like
it may come down to California

01:21:01.437 --> 01:21:04.031
This looks like
it may come down to California

01:21:04.107 --> 01:21:06.598
This looks like
it may come down to California

01:21:08.545 --> 01:21:12.003
I need to know. How real is this?
Can we win without California?

01:21:12.081 --> 01:21:15.642
We stand a chance if you call
your connections to the energy companies--

01:21:15.718 --> 01:21:18.312
No, you can't win without California

01:21:18.454 --> 01:21:19.887
What are you doing here?

01:21:19.956 --> 01:21:23.289
Shut up. You want to win,
you'll do what l tell you.

01:21:23.693 --> 01:21:26.594
Gilliam has
over 90 percent minority turnout.

01:21:26.663 --> 01:21:30.861
Whites are the majority,
but they're not voting. They don't like you.

01:21:31.167 --> 01:21:33.192
-I like you, sir.
-Shut up.

01:21:33.736 --> 01:21:35.431
How can we turn this around?

01:21:35.505 --> 01:21:38.906
There's about one and a half hours left
at the West Coast polls.

01:21:38.975 --> 01:21:42.741
If there's a leak saying Gilliam
is going to win, you'll get a late rush.

01:21:42.812 --> 01:21:45.610
You get California, you get the election.

01:21:46.649 --> 01:21:51.313
It will make the 6:30 news if we do it now.
We just have to put it out there.

01:21:51.387 --> 01:21:54.652
-Can we do this?
-We're the government. We can do anything.

01:21:55.592 --> 01:21:58.356
The race for President
now turns to the West Coast.

01:21:58.428 --> 01:22:01.420
People, Armageddon is upon us
and Big Dave is scared.

01:22:01.497 --> 01:22:05.934
If these voting trends sustain,
it's likely that for the first time in history...

01:22:06.002 --> 01:22:10.063
a black man will become
President of the United States ofAmerica.

01:22:46.276 --> 01:22:49.973
"l have a dream that one day...

01:22:51.748 --> 01:22:54.114
"this nation will rise up...

01:22:55.418 --> 01:22:58.353
"and live out the true meaning of its creed.:

01:22:59.255 --> 01:23:02.418
"'We hold these truths to be self-evident.:

01:23:02.659 --> 01:23:04.991
"'that aIl men are created equaI. "'

01:23:05.962 --> 01:23:06.951
Checkmate.

01:23:07.030 --> 01:23:09.430
I, Richard Nixon, do solemnly swear....

01:23:09.499 --> 01:23:11.694
I, RonaId Reagan, do solemnly swear....

01:23:18.706 --> 01:23:20.537
The race for President is over.

01:23:22.076 --> 01:23:23.600
The election is now over.

01:23:23.678 --> 01:23:26.044
-The race for President....
-...is over.

01:23:28.649 --> 01:23:30.674
The race for President is over.

01:23:31.052 --> 01:23:35.113
For the first time in history,
a black man, Mays Gilliam...

01:23:35.856 --> 01:23:39.690
will be the next President
of the United States ofAmerica.

01:23:58.846 --> 01:24:00.507
Come here, brother.

01:24:03.150 --> 01:24:05.243
-I love you, man!
-I love you, too.

01:24:14.295 --> 01:24:16.525
I appreciate it. Thanks a lot.

01:24:19.233 --> 01:24:20.564
Thank you.

01:24:23.170 --> 01:24:26.071
We won! Aren't you happy?

01:24:26.507 --> 01:24:28.566
-Can l have a massage?
-Yes!

01:24:28.976 --> 01:24:30.841
I won!

01:24:32.680 --> 01:24:36.081
There is no way in the world
l could have ever done this without you.

01:24:36.150 --> 01:24:37.344
You're damn right.

01:24:37.418 --> 01:24:40.444
We won! We did it! Yes!

01:24:42.356 --> 01:24:44.290
Look at my little brother!

01:24:44.358 --> 01:24:48.055
-Boy, l'm proud of you! Mr. President!
-Mr. Vice President.

01:24:48.162 --> 01:24:52.622
You're the man! You ain't got to worry about
no assassinations or nothing.

01:24:52.700 --> 01:24:55.134
They sure don't want me
to be the next President.

01:24:55.202 --> 01:24:57.397
You can raise taxes, start a war....

01:24:57.471 --> 01:24:59.200
Mays Gilliam began this race....

01:24:59.273 --> 01:25:02.208
That's my man!

01:25:04.145 --> 01:25:05.806
Excuse me, please.

01:25:07.515 --> 01:25:09.983
-I've been looking for you.
-I was looking for you.

01:25:10.050 --> 01:25:12.541
-This is amazing!
-It's amazing.

01:25:12.620 --> 01:25:14.417
It's incredible.

01:25:14.488 --> 01:25:16.581
-What you were up against.
-The odds!

01:25:16.657 --> 01:25:20.024
I can't wait to start working,
and do l have a job for you!

01:25:20.828 --> 01:25:24.696
I don't know what to say. What department
do you want me to work in? Finance?

01:25:24.765 --> 01:25:27.825
No, that's not good enough for you.

01:25:27.902 --> 01:25:30.302
-Foreign Affairs?
-No, not Foreign Affairs.

01:25:30.371 --> 01:25:33.568
I thought you could do
something real good in Security!

01:25:34.475 --> 01:25:35.737
You suck!

01:25:40.781 --> 01:25:43.978
We'd like you to run for President.

01:25:44.385 --> 01:25:47.684
Sometimes, you don't know
ifpeople like you for you.

01:25:48.122 --> 01:25:49.885
I like you for you.

01:25:50.157 --> 01:25:51.647
Thanks a lot.

01:25:54.094 --> 01:25:56.426
Get your hand off my ass, boy!

01:25:57.965 --> 01:25:59.091
Wait!

01:26:02.736 --> 01:26:05.933
Oh, my God, you are everywhere.
Look at you!

01:26:08.509 --> 01:26:11.376
What's the first thing
you're going to do, Mr. President?

01:26:11.445 --> 01:26:14.642
The first thing l'll do
is make you my First Lady.

01:26:15.449 --> 01:26:18.145
-Don't you play with me like that.
-I'm not playing.

01:26:18.219 --> 01:26:19.413
You can't do that!

01:26:19.487 --> 01:26:22.081
I'm the government. I can do anything.

01:26:38.839 --> 01:26:39.965
Get ready for...

01:26:40.040 --> 01:26:44.067
the 2005 PresidentiaI lnauguraI BaIl.

01:26:44.211 --> 01:26:48.910
Ladies and gentlemen, the President
of the United States of America..

01:26:48.983 --> 01:26:52.851
Mays Gilliam, and his future First Wifey...

01:26:52.920 --> 01:26:54.478
Lisa Clark!

01:27:06.667 --> 01:27:08.965
Look at him now, man
Ain't this great

01:27:09.036 --> 01:27:11.197
Biggest man in town
He's the head ofstate

01:27:11.272 --> 01:27:13.763
They come from aIl around
just for one handshake

01:27:13.841 --> 01:27:17.038
Look at him now
He's the head ofstate

01:27:23.217 --> 01:27:26.015
That's me, Mays Gilliam...

01:27:26.120 --> 01:27:28.987
President of the United States ofAmerica.

01:27:29.390 --> 01:27:30.810
North America.

01:27:37.950 --> 01:27:39.679
-Who did you vote for?
-For what?

01:27:39.752 --> 01:27:41.276
-For President.
-Of what?

01:27:41.354 --> 01:27:43.720
-Of the United States.
-Of what?

01:27:43.789 --> 01:27:45.518
-Of America
-What America?

01:27:45.591 --> 01:27:46.717
North America

01:27:46.792 --> 01:27:49.818
Slick, l don't vote.
You gonna buy some of this meat, or what?

01:27:50.029 --> 01:27:54.523
You can't trust nobody.
Everybody's trying to rob you. Nobody!

01:27:54.634 --> 01:27:57.068
That guy right there! Don't trust him!

01:27:57.136 --> 01:27:58.967
Can't trust no-damn-body!

01:27:59.038 --> 01:28:01.632
America is taking advantage of you!

01:28:01.774 --> 01:28:06.404
You can go to war when you're 18,
but you can't have a drink till you're 21 !

01:28:06.612 --> 01:28:09.843
-That ain't right!
-Right! So, let me get this straight.

01:28:09.915 --> 01:28:12.213
You're 18 years old. You go to war.

01:28:12.284 --> 01:28:14.718
You come back. Your leg is chopped off!

01:28:14.787 --> 01:28:16.482
You got a damn nub!

01:28:16.555 --> 01:28:19.046
Everywhere you go they say,
"What's up, nubby?"

01:28:19.125 --> 01:28:22.583
You get to the bar and say,
"Bartender, can l have a drink?"

01:28:22.662 --> 01:28:26.359
He looks you up and down and says,
"l got to see some ID."

01:28:26.432 --> 01:28:31.131
ID? You mean to tell me
a one-legged teenager can't have a drink?

01:28:31.303 --> 01:28:34.864
-That ain't right!
-Where is the nub?

01:28:34.974 --> 01:28:39.274
Prescription drugs, l'll lower the prices.
Let me explain something else to you.

01:28:39.345 --> 01:28:40.937
You can survive a stroke...

01:28:41.013 --> 01:28:44.449
but the high prices of medicine
will give you a heart attack.

01:28:44.517 --> 01:28:48.248
America is the richest,
most powerful nation on earth.

01:28:48.354 --> 01:28:52.381
If America was a car, it would be a Bentley...

01:28:52.458 --> 01:28:56.918
sitting on chrome doves,
with TVs in the headrests...

01:28:56.996 --> 01:29:00.454
and a fine, naked Puerto Rican girl
feeding you grapes!

01:29:00.733 --> 01:29:04.294
Ain't nothing better than that!
Ain't nothing ever been better than that!

01:29:04.370 --> 01:29:08.534
Most opponents are saying your brother
destroyed any chance of winning...
