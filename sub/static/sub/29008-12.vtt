00:16.960 --> 00:19.440
"Hello, it’s Raquel.
I can’t answer your call right now.

00:19.520 --> 00:21.800
If it’s urgent,
leave your message after the beep."

00:22.760 --> 00:23.640
Raquel,

00:24.240 --> 00:26.840
Why the heck you don’t pick up?

00:27.320 --> 00:31.800
Huh? After 15 years with you,
besides you, like a fucking fool.

00:33.800 --> 00:35.600
And not to get closer to you, no, no.

00:36.240 --> 00:37.360
Because of our friendship.

00:38.120 --> 00:40.600
Because of love, do you hear me?
Because of love.

00:52.800 --> 00:55.440
-Go in, please.
-No, you go first.

00:56.960 --> 00:57.840
Come on.

01:05.120 --> 01:07.760
SUNDAY
9:45 PM

01:09.360 --> 01:10.320
What’s this?

01:11.400 --> 01:12.640
A warehouse.

01:15.000 --> 01:16.200
And these plastics?

01:16.360 --> 01:18.640
They’re just plastics
to protect from the coldness.

01:18.840 --> 01:21.080
60 HOURS OF ROBBERY

01:21.880 --> 01:22.960
I’m not frightened.

01:27.440 --> 01:28.320
Keep walking.

01:42.720 --> 01:43.720
Switch the light on.

01:47.480 --> 01:49.240
And don’t do any foolishness.

03:21.200 --> 03:24.880
And you, what did you do before this?
You haven’t always been a robber.

03:24.960 --> 03:27.360
-I’ve done a lot of things before this.
-What things?

03:30.360 --> 03:31.920
Mainly sales rep.

03:32.880 --> 03:34.960
Also in the chemical industry,

03:35.720 --> 03:38.680
security guard in a car park
and I dance in a disco, too.

03:38.840 --> 03:40.600
-What?
-Yes, there, no shirt,

03:40.680 --> 03:43.000
with a lot of birds inside a cage
dancing away.

03:43.080 --> 03:46.240
-But, like untz untz untz?
-Untz, untz and whatever they play.

03:46.320 --> 03:48.800
Samba, twist, rock and roll,
you’d be amazed.

03:48.880 --> 03:50.280
What, really, I’ll be amazed?

03:50.360 --> 03:53.320
Let me be amazed then.
Let me see how you dance.

03:54.520 --> 03:56.560
-Here?
-Come on, dance for me a little.

04:00.000 --> 04:00.880
Give me a minute.

04:01.400 --> 04:02.280
Okay.

04:44.720 --> 04:47.920
Listen, I’d been very close
to breaking up with everything,

04:48.080 --> 04:51.880
to ditching Mari Carmen for a bitch
that not even Prieto would fuck.

04:51.960 --> 04:56.080
Do you hear me? Yes, you’re a bitch,
a selfish and obsessive bitch.

04:56.240 --> 04:58.400
A fucking bitch! Fucking bitch!

04:58.480 --> 05:01.200
A cunt licker, a frigid, for fucking sake.

05:01.280 --> 05:03.040
A fucking frigid.

05:49.120 --> 05:51.720
Raquel, it’s me, Ángel, again.

05:52.840 --> 05:54.040
I’m sorry, I didn’t...

05:55.200 --> 05:58.120
I didn’t want to call you "bitch",
really, I’m sorry.

06:02.080 --> 06:03.560
You’ll ruin my life.

06:05.360 --> 06:08.000
I don’t know what I’ll do if I’m dismissed
from the police department.

06:08.160 --> 06:09.560
I don’t know how I’ll cope.

06:11.120 --> 06:12.440
You’ll destroy me.

06:19.920 --> 06:21.920
I know I told you I was unemployed, but...

06:23.040 --> 06:27.200
This cider thing isn’t a job as such.
It’s basically a project.

06:27.840 --> 06:29.880
I don’t know whether it’ll work or not.

06:29.960 --> 06:32.720
And, honestly, I don’t know
what is on your mind.

06:33.280 --> 06:36.800
I don’t know
if your partner saw something illegal.

06:37.480 --> 06:40.840
It’s true that some nights I sleep here,

06:40.920 --> 06:43.760
on the bunk beds,
and I have no certificate of habitability.

06:43.840 --> 06:47.400
I don’t know if that’s what he saw or that
it has to pass some kind of inspection.

06:47.480 --> 06:48.560
I don’t really know.

06:51.200 --> 06:52.080
The cider.

06:53.040 --> 06:54.520
Can I taste the cider?

06:58.360 --> 06:59.640
Sure, of course.

07:01.200 --> 07:03.560
"It was quite obvious
that the Inspector would want to get in

07:03.640 --> 07:05.680
in the Professor’s little corner.

07:07.760 --> 07:10.880
And for a bunch of euros
is easy to rent a filthy warehouse

07:10.960 --> 07:13.880
and turn into the perfect set
for the performance.

07:15.880 --> 07:19.960
Being willing to believe or not
was up to the Inspector."

07:24.000 --> 07:25.760
I’m sorry, Salva.

07:28.840 --> 07:30.240
This place is lovely.

07:32.160 --> 07:34.720
I feel very... very embarrassed

07:35.520 --> 07:38.360
for pointing my gun at you

07:38.440 --> 07:41.520
to force you to bring me over.

07:42.240 --> 07:43.120
The truth.

07:43.520 --> 07:45.920
I would have rather showed
you something else.

07:47.200 --> 07:51.240
I mean, some other thing as you call it,
as in "Basic Instinct", I don’t know.

07:52.320 --> 07:53.360
I’d feel...

07:54.680 --> 07:57.360
much less stupid and embarrassed

07:58.400 --> 07:59.840
than I feel now.

08:02.040 --> 08:02.920
And...

08:04.400 --> 08:07.160
To think that I almost sent
my ex-husband over...

08:08.240 --> 08:09.400
Your ex-husband?

08:10.520 --> 08:13.400
Yes, I know he’s a fucking jerk,

08:13.480 --> 08:17.720
but he’s the best
in the whole Scientific branch

08:17.800 --> 08:22.320
because, obviously, they had described
this place as if it was a drugs lab.

08:23.960 --> 08:25.120
-I’m sorry.
-Drugs.

08:25.200 --> 08:26.080
Yes.

08:27.560 --> 08:29.200
I almost...

08:30.560 --> 08:32.000
I almost make an even bigger mistake.

08:59.600 --> 09:02.960
I want you to know that I’ll
never pull out my gun again.

09:04.480 --> 09:05.720
-Yes.
-Well.

09:10.680 --> 09:13.280
Or frisk you,
or have any doubts about you.

09:13.360 --> 09:14.240
Good, good.

09:15.480 --> 09:17.480
About you, Salva.

09:17.960 --> 09:18.840
About you.

09:19.800 --> 09:23.680
I think it's time
to treat us less formally, isn't it?

09:25.360 --> 09:28.720
-I couldn't agree less.
-Sure.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.480
-I agree.
-Me too.

09:46.040 --> 09:48.080
-"Ángel, is it a good moment?"
-Yes, tell me, Pilar.

09:48.440 --> 09:50.520
I have the results of what you asked me.

09:51.240 --> 09:54.280
I analysed the fingerprint from the car
and the one from the coffee spoon

09:54.360 --> 09:56.000
and bingo, they’re a match.

09:56.200 --> 10:00.040
The person who touched that spoon is the
same one who forced his way in the car.

10:00.280 --> 10:01.560
That’s awesome, Pilar.

10:01.720 --> 10:03.840
"It’s awesome. I’ll call you later."

10:13.080 --> 10:15.800
"The voice mailbox of the number
you have dialled is full."

10:15.880 --> 10:16.760
Fuck.

10:21.280 --> 10:22.160
It’s time.

10:22.400 --> 10:24.000
The guards must be untying themselves
by now.

10:24.080 --> 10:25.880
At 10:30 PM
they’ll come out of the warehouse.

10:25.960 --> 10:27.480
-Do you know where it is?
-Yes, right here.

10:27.560 --> 10:30.280
Listen, can I tell someone?
Five or six mates.

10:30.440 --> 10:32.800
-No way. Are you mad?
-But why?

10:32.880 --> 10:35.760
Do you want to screw all up before
we start? Three people already mean

10:35.840 --> 10:38.000
a great risk for the plan,
four would be extremely foolish.

10:38.080 --> 10:40.120
-We’ll help them from outside.
-Three people?

10:40.200 --> 10:41.800
And who is that third person?

10:42.360 --> 10:43.560
Mónica Gaztambide.

10:44.320 --> 10:46.320
She’s pregnant,
we need to get her out of here.

10:46.400 --> 10:47.280
I see.

10:47.840 --> 10:49.760
-Where the heck are you going?
-To find her.

10:49.840 --> 10:52.600
And what about me? I stay here?
How do I get to the warehouse?

10:52.680 --> 10:55.080
-I can’t go in as I please.
-Sort out your own problems.

10:55.160 --> 10:57.360
Don’t fuck me. What I have to do is worse.

10:57.440 --> 11:01.120
Quite worse. I have to convince
that guy to take me over to Mónica

11:02.040 --> 11:03.240
and then get rid of him.

11:04.400 --> 11:05.800
Are you going to kill him?

11:06.280 --> 11:09.320
What I’m not doing is staying here
waiting like a lamb to be shot.

11:10.160 --> 11:12.360
A man has to do what a man has to do.

11:17.040 --> 11:17.920
Helsinki.

11:19.000 --> 11:19.880
What’s the matter?

11:21.680 --> 11:23.360
I’m still not feeling well.

11:24.760 --> 11:27.240
What’s wrong, Arturo?
You want some more tablets?

11:27.400 --> 11:28.280
No.

11:28.960 --> 11:31.560
I wish my problem was solved
by taking an aspirin. No, no.

11:32.360 --> 11:33.240
It’s not that.

11:35.480 --> 11:38.480
You see, earlier on,
when I saw Mónica Gaztambide,

11:38.560 --> 11:40.440
and realized she was alive, she was fine,

11:41.920 --> 11:43.480
I went to pieces...

11:44.360 --> 11:46.440
I think I didn’t react as she expected.

11:47.600 --> 11:51.040
The thing is that, later on
that colleague of yours,

11:51.680 --> 11:52.560
Denver,

11:52.920 --> 11:55.960
escorted her downstairs, wherever
you are keeping her, to have a rest,

11:57.920 --> 12:01.000
and I felt the urge to speak with her.

12:01.840 --> 12:03.280
I felt a very strong urge.

12:05.200 --> 12:06.080
Please.

12:07.760 --> 12:09.520
Man helps man in love.

12:10.440 --> 12:12.160
Yes? No problem.

12:16.320 --> 12:18.160
It’s fine, Arturito, fine.

12:18.800 --> 12:20.080
-Let’s go.
-Thank you.

12:33.520 --> 12:35.960
"And while our first defeat
was approaching,

12:37.520 --> 12:39.760
the master mind of the operation
wasn’t there,

12:41.720 --> 12:45.320
because as brilliant as he was
he only had two eyes,

12:46.320 --> 12:48.920
and at that particular moment
they were set on the Inspector."

12:49.640 --> 12:50.520
What?

12:51.920 --> 12:52.800
Nothing.

12:54.960 --> 12:55.840
What?

12:57.360 --> 12:58.560
You were looking at me.

13:00.720 --> 13:02.960
I don’t know, like this,

13:03.760 --> 13:04.800
with no glasses on,

13:06.160 --> 13:07.600
you look like a different person.

13:09.080 --> 13:12.600
Like Superman and Clark Kent.

13:19.320 --> 13:21.040
So, you like me with glasses.

13:22.520 --> 13:23.760
No, I didn’t say that.

13:25.280 --> 13:26.560
I’ll put them on right now.

13:30.960 --> 13:33.920
It’s kind of weird to sleep
with your glasses on, but it’s fine.

13:34.000 --> 13:36.120
It’s fine.
I usually take them off, but today...

13:37.440 --> 13:38.880
Today is a special day.

13:40.760 --> 13:41.640
Better?

13:52.440 --> 13:53.680
The thing is...

13:54.640 --> 13:57.120
I can’t stay the night, I’m sorry.

14:06.640 --> 14:07.840
I don’t know, I want...

14:08.720 --> 14:10.400
to wake up at home with my daughter,

14:11.160 --> 14:12.680
drop her at school.

14:13.240 --> 14:15.640
-So she can see she still has a mum.
-Sure.

14:23.760 --> 14:26.400
"Hello, it’s Raquel.
I can’t answer you right know.

14:26.480 --> 14:29.040
If it’s urgent,
leave the message after the beep."

14:31.280 --> 14:32.720
"Raquel, it’s me again."

14:32.880 --> 14:34.720
Call me, your voice mailbox is full.

14:34.880 --> 14:36.880
We have him, listen, we have him.

14:37.040 --> 14:39.360
"We have the guy
who is helping them from outside."

14:39.520 --> 14:42.840
But you still got
at least seven or eight hours

14:43.280 --> 14:44.880
to drop your daughter at school.

14:47.720 --> 14:51.360
I mean... If you are there
at 12 AM or at 1 AM

14:52.160 --> 14:53.720
or at 7 AM...

14:54.480 --> 14:55.800
That should be early enough, shouldn’t it?

15:01.800 --> 15:04.440
It’s Salva, Salva,
Salva, the one that makes cider.

15:04.520 --> 15:07.840
He was in the wreck yard, he threatened
the Russian guy, for heaven’s sake.

15:08.240 --> 15:09.120
I’m sorry.

15:09.960 --> 15:10.960
I’m not staying.

15:15.560 --> 15:17.480
Hey, and that piano over there?

15:18.520 --> 15:19.520
Do you play the piano?

15:20.560 --> 15:23.520
He’s using you, damn.
His fingerprints were in the patrol car.

15:23.600 --> 15:25.760
He’s got closer to you
to learn about the investigation.

15:25.840 --> 15:27.240
He’s using you, Raquel.

15:28.760 --> 15:29.640
Shit.

15:30.680 --> 15:31.560
Shit.

17:05.320 --> 17:06.440
Is it your wife?

17:08.560 --> 17:09.440
No.

17:09.800 --> 17:12.800
Mónica isn’t the loud type.
It must be one of your colleagues.

17:28.680 --> 17:29.560
Don’t stop.

17:31.440 --> 17:34.080
For heaven’s sake, Arturo,
what the heck are you doing here?

18:49.320 --> 18:51.720
"Arturo at last had had a heroic gesture.

18:52.120 --> 18:56.200
Instead of escaping alone,
he’d decided to rescue his princess.

18:57.400 --> 18:59.200
But it backfired on him.

19:00.080 --> 19:02.200
Because princesses
have their own lives too."

19:02.480 --> 19:03.400
What’s the matter, Mónica?

19:03.800 --> 19:04.920
"And their own secrets."

19:05.240 --> 19:07.480
-Was that savage raping you?
-He wasn’t raping me.

19:07.640 --> 19:09.000
Don’t speak nonsense.

19:11.800 --> 19:15.840
"We’ve always heard stories about husbands
catching their wives with their lover.

19:17.480 --> 19:19.320
But when Arturo caught his lover’s lover

19:20.320 --> 19:21.720
he forgot all about his escape plan."

19:22.800 --> 19:23.680
Arturo, man.

19:26.080 --> 19:27.920
"He only heard one word."

19:28.240 --> 19:29.600
-I’m fine.
-Breathe, breathe.

19:29.680 --> 19:30.640
Breathe deeply.

19:30.720 --> 19:31.600
"Vengeance".

19:32.600 --> 19:34.440
Put your clothes on, darling,
and leave, please.

19:34.720 --> 19:35.800
-What?
-Put your clothes on.

19:35.880 --> 19:37.560
-And leave, please.
-I’m not leaving.

19:39.240 --> 19:40.840
Take her out,
leave me alone with this guy.

19:40.920 --> 19:41.800
What do you want to do?

19:42.240 --> 19:45.360
Let’s not get things out of hand,
Arturito, these things can be discussed.

19:45.840 --> 19:46.720
I won’t leave.

19:46.800 --> 19:48.640
I told you to take her away,
for fuck’s sake.

19:49.120 --> 19:51.480
Get her out now
and leave me here alone with this scum.

19:51.560 --> 19:53.800
Yes! You and I, yes, here.

19:53.960 --> 19:55.360
Now, you and I.

19:56.080 --> 19:57.200
Motherfucker.

20:08.960 --> 20:10.640
-Please, please.
-Leave.

20:10.720 --> 20:11.600
-No.
-Leave.

20:11.760 --> 20:13.200
-Everything’s okay.
-What will you do?

20:13.280 --> 20:14.920
-It’s fine.
-I said no.

20:15.000 --> 20:16.880
-It’s fine.
-What are you going to do?

20:16.960 --> 20:18.760
-It’s okay, leave.
-I want to stay.

20:18.920 --> 20:21.120
Leave, everything is fine.

20:28.400 --> 20:29.280
Let’s go.

20:40.720 --> 20:44.280
You have a lot of nerve taking advantage
of a defenceless and wounded woman.

20:46.840 --> 20:50.000
Let’s see if you have what it takes
to fight me, son of a bitch.

20:57.440 --> 20:59.760
You’ll get hurt, Arturito, be careful.

21:13.960 --> 21:15.480
-Stop!
-No, I’m a hostage.

21:15.640 --> 21:18.600
-I’m meeting Arturo Román here.
-Where is Mr Román?

21:18.760 --> 21:21.240
I don’t know, he told me
to be here at 10:30 PM.

21:23.160 --> 21:24.440
Let’s go now, please.

21:25.320 --> 21:26.760
Let’s wait for Mr Román.

21:27.360 --> 21:28.600
We still got two minutes.

21:29.800 --> 21:31.640
She’s pregnant, did you know?

21:32.800 --> 21:34.120
She’s carrying my baby.

21:34.240 --> 21:35.320
Mine!

21:35.920 --> 21:39.320
I don’t think my son would like
you go knocking on his door.

21:42.040 --> 21:44.520
Arturito, you’re asking for a smack
and something else. Stop it now.

21:44.800 --> 21:46.960
I’m going to kill you, son of a bitch.

21:56.600 --> 21:57.920
Who is laughing now, hey?

22:00.600 --> 22:03.360
I can’t hear that stupid laugh.

22:16.240 --> 22:17.720
You tried to kill me,

22:18.280 --> 22:20.720
with a pair of blunt-tip scissors,
Arturito?

22:23.520 --> 22:24.400
Sorry.

22:26.680 --> 22:29.520
I didn’t mean it, I swear.
It’s this damn stress

22:29.600 --> 22:32.960
that makes me get it wrong all the time.
Forgive me, I’m sorry.

22:33.280 --> 22:34.320
You’re stupid.

22:35.440 --> 22:37.400
-Don’t hit me!
-Give me a fucking reason...

22:37.480 --> 22:38.400
Look at me.

22:38.560 --> 22:41.480
Give me a fucking reason,
to not smash your head this very instant.

22:41.560 --> 22:43.040
Give me a fucking reason.

22:43.200 --> 22:44.960
-They’re escaping.
-What?

22:45.040 --> 22:48.720
They’re escaping, 16 hostages, now.

22:48.960 --> 22:50.280
And I know where through.

22:57.680 --> 23:00.320
No more time, gentlemen. Let’s go.

23:13.800 --> 23:14.640
Stop!

23:20.920 --> 23:22.520
Plastic explosives.

23:30.040 --> 23:33.400
16 hostages are escaping
through the loading area.

23:34.120 --> 23:36.000
Tokyo, go and get Nairobi.

23:36.680 --> 23:38.800
Rio, Denver, get Oslo and Helsinki.

24:01.040 --> 24:01.920
What’s wrong?

24:02.760 --> 24:05.280
-16 hostages are trying to escape.
-For fuck’s sake.

24:08.840 --> 24:10.320
And we’re going to stop them.

24:12.920 --> 24:13.920
-Ready?
-Ready.

24:14.000 --> 24:14.880
Let’s go!

24:15.680 --> 24:16.920
For fuck's sake.

24:17.080 --> 24:18.440
Let’s go, let’s go!

24:19.080 --> 24:21.080
Take cover, take cover!

24:21.760 --> 24:23.880
-Has everyone taken cover?
-Yes.

24:24.680 --> 24:25.560
Off I go.

25:18.600 --> 25:19.800
Attention!

25:19.880 --> 25:21.480
Explosion inside the building.

25:21.560 --> 25:23.480
I want communication
with the SWAT team, now.

25:24.600 --> 25:27.400
Teams 1 and 2,
go to the area of the incident.

25:27.560 --> 25:28.760
Go, go!

25:28.920 --> 25:30.800
Priority: rescuing the hostages.

25:33.480 --> 25:34.880
Assessment of possible entry.

25:39.800 --> 25:42.640
Click on the camera in the loading area.

25:42.840 --> 25:43.880
That’s the one.

25:45.080 --> 25:46.960
"Attention, there’s some movement.
There are people walking out.

25:48.240 --> 25:50.440
We have got a clear shot,
I repeat, clear shot."

25:50.760 --> 25:51.720
They’re hostages.

25:52.360 --> 25:53.240
They’re hostages.

25:53.320 --> 25:56.080
"We have visual. We await confirmation."

26:08.680 --> 26:10.520
"You know when there’s gridlock
after a road accident

26:10.680 --> 26:12.520
is not due to the accident itself.

26:13.680 --> 26:15.680
It’s because the other car drivers
stop to watch.

26:16.840 --> 26:18.000
They can’t help it.

26:18.680 --> 26:22.400
Because deep down we’re as basic
as a mosquito attracted to light,

26:22.920 --> 26:26.520
as any insect
that tries to escape when you cage it.

26:30.120 --> 26:31.440
And Inspector Murillo

26:32.080 --> 26:34.640
isn’t much more complex, anyway."

26:34.920 --> 26:36.720
Can I have a white coffee
with extra coffee?

27:00.280 --> 27:01.480
"That’s why she was there,

27:02.080 --> 27:05.400
washing her armpits
and smiling stupidly at the mirror,

27:05.480 --> 27:08.440
as his partner was fighting for his life."

27:11.760 --> 27:14.120
Confirmed, they’re hostages, confirmed.

27:14.280 --> 27:15.880
Rescue protocol.

27:16.040 --> 27:17.600
"I want a clean retrieval."

27:17.760 --> 27:18.640
Move forward!

27:21.240 --> 27:22.120
-Let’s go.
-Let’s go!

27:22.280 --> 27:23.480
We need to get them out of here.

27:35.640 --> 27:37.160
Come on, we need to get out.

27:40.560 --> 27:41.200
Come on!

27:44.400 --> 27:46.080
-Move fast, quick.
-Come on, come on.

27:49.160 --> 27:50.640
Move, come on, get out!

27:56.320 --> 27:59.600
Medical team, ready.
I want all the hostages here. Come on!

28:08.480 --> 28:10.000
-Come on, come on.
-Come on.

28:10.560 --> 28:12.000
You’ll be fine here, move.

28:17.560 --> 28:19.560
Please, back off for one second.

28:19.800 --> 28:21.040
Ready.

28:27.800 --> 28:28.840
We continue the massage.

28:32.680 --> 28:33.600
Clear, again.

28:50.360 --> 28:51.840
"We have inside visual."

28:52.920 --> 28:54.960
-He’s wearing a face mask of Dalí.
-It’s a robber.

28:58.040 --> 28:59.840
Right conditions to go in.

28:59.920 --> 29:02.240
-"We are waiting for orders."
-SWAT team, ready.

29:02.640 --> 29:03.800
We’re going in.

29:06.520 --> 29:09.560
"The world could collapse around her
and she was only thinking of...

29:10.160 --> 29:11.040
nothing,

29:11.480 --> 29:14.320
the way you feel when you’ve just
had the best shag of the century.

29:14.720 --> 29:17.160
But there’s always something
that takes you back to reality

29:17.240 --> 29:18.960
and it’s no usually in a placid way."

29:19.080 --> 29:20.920
"Witnesses there
are talking about a big deflagration

29:21.080 --> 29:23.480
inside the Fábrica Nacional
de Moneda y Timbre,

29:23.560 --> 29:26.800
and that between 15 and 16 hostages
managed to escape.

29:26.880 --> 29:29.600
Their identity is yet unknown.

29:29.760 --> 29:31.640
Apparently, they have not been
seriously injured.

29:32.000 --> 29:34.640
And, the latest news.
Detective Ángel Rubio,

29:34.720 --> 29:37.320
one of the officers
in charge of the crisis with hostages,

29:37.400 --> 29:40.120
has been involved in a severe car accident
on the M-506,

29:40.280 --> 29:42.480
from Getafe to Pinto, in Madrid.

29:42.560 --> 29:45.720
His vehicle skidded off the road
and has rolled over several times.

29:46.240 --> 29:49.400
The detective is receiving
medical attention

29:49.480 --> 29:52.520
and it’s yet unknown
how his physical condition is.

29:52.600 --> 29:55.400
There were no other vehicles
involved in this car accident.

29:55.480 --> 29:56.640
It is also unknown

29:56.800 --> 29:59.840
whether the accident was due
to mechanical failure or distraction."

30:37.360 --> 30:39.880
Mari Carmen, I’m sorry.

30:48.320 --> 30:49.560
Ángel’s things.

31:02.240 --> 31:03.160
What happened?

31:04.920 --> 31:06.920
He had been drinking before the crash.

31:07.880 --> 31:09.320
I spoke to the police.

31:10.600 --> 31:12.360
He phoned you 16 times.

31:19.000 --> 31:19.880
What happened?

31:21.560 --> 31:22.760
What did you say to him?

31:26.240 --> 31:27.480
Nothing, I didn’t...

31:28.880 --> 31:30.400
I didn’t answer his calls.

31:31.560 --> 31:33.520
I was in an operation.

31:34.440 --> 31:36.720
Tell me what happened
between you two, please.

31:38.400 --> 31:39.480
Ángel flipped his car.

31:40.960 --> 31:42.400
He invaded the opposite lane.

31:43.040 --> 31:45.640
And he swerved as if he wanted
to put an end to everything.

31:53.120 --> 31:55.920
A friend of his, in the traffic branch,
passed on to me this video.

31:58.960 --> 31:59.840
Tell me.

32:01.560 --> 32:03.680
Why did my husband try to kill himself?

32:07.320 --> 32:08.200
I don’t know.

32:10.880 --> 32:13.840
-Things were not going well at work.
-At work?

32:16.120 --> 32:17.520
I’ve been waiting for seven years,

32:19.920 --> 32:23.720
seven years waiting for that one day
he would stop being in love with you.

32:32.040 --> 32:34.400
And now the only thing I hope
is that he wakes up.

32:58.040 --> 32:58.920
Yes?

33:00.320 --> 33:02.840
-Nairobi, are you all right?
-I think I have a temperature.

33:10.640 --> 33:11.520
Let me see.

33:17.360 --> 33:19.120
No, you don’t seem to have a temperature.

33:22.240 --> 33:24.800
Perhaps it was the barbecue.
I’m not feeling well, either.

33:26.600 --> 33:28.760
Then lie down here.

33:29.360 --> 33:30.400
There’s plenty of room.

33:33.360 --> 33:35.800
Mr Professor, I won’t bite you.

33:47.920 --> 33:49.320
Is it me or...

33:50.880 --> 33:53.280
there’s some tension in the atmosphere?

33:57.200 --> 33:58.720
-Tension, you think.
-Yes.

33:59.600 --> 34:00.480
Here.

34:02.320 --> 34:06.080
It might be the four months

34:07.440 --> 34:09.080
we have been confined here or...

34:10.480 --> 34:11.840
or the temperature or...

34:13.240 --> 34:14.880
or that you’re attractive.

34:18.280 --> 34:19.960
Don’t you find me attractive?

34:22.880 --> 34:23.760
Well...

34:25.200 --> 34:27.120
Nairobi, there’s no doubt...

34:28.200 --> 34:31.840
you’re a woman with a lot of temperament,
you’re a racial woman,

34:33.160 --> 34:34.400
a striking woman, no doubt.

34:36.560 --> 34:39.800
And I, of course, I’m sensitive
to those stimulus, surely I am .

34:39.960 --> 34:40.880
It goes without saying.

34:41.960 --> 34:44.800
But those kind of relationships
are not allowed,

34:46.600 --> 34:47.840
interpersonal ones.

34:48.600 --> 34:52.880
I see, but I’m not actually asking you
to marry me, Mr Professor.

34:53.280 --> 34:55.960
-I know, but really, I can’t...
-A quicky one.

34:56.280 --> 34:57.160
Please.

34:58.960 --> 34:59.840
Gosh.

35:03.440 --> 35:04.480
Okay, fine.

35:08.360 --> 35:10.600
I wouldn’t want to hurt your feelings,
but, really, we can’t.

35:14.840 --> 35:16.200
No, you can’t hurt my feelings.

35:18.480 --> 35:19.920
As a matter of fact, I think

35:20.600 --> 35:23.000
you’re the man who’s treated me
the best in my entire life.

35:26.120 --> 35:27.200
You and your plan.

35:32.840 --> 35:36.200
Tokyo told me
that the plan wasn’t your idea.

35:38.200 --> 35:41.040
But you didn’t tell her whose idea it was.

35:45.760 --> 35:49.640
The most important person of my life.

35:54.200 --> 35:55.680
I was a sick child, you know?

35:58.400 --> 36:00.120
And a sick adolescent.

36:03.120 --> 36:07.400
So I was bedridden in hospital
for many years

36:08.880 --> 36:10.800
reading, reading extensively.

36:12.520 --> 36:13.480
My father

36:15.160 --> 36:17.120
used to tell me stories,
used to tell me...

36:17.800 --> 36:20.800
about the plots of films of robberies
he had seen.

36:22.480 --> 36:23.400
What a character.

36:24.080 --> 36:27.400
Wasn’t him? Your father,
instead of telling you "Ugly duckling."

36:31.000 --> 36:31.880
One day

36:33.720 --> 36:36.680
he told me about the plot of the most
extraordinary film ever made.

36:38.400 --> 36:41.840
"Did you know that money is made
by a machine, right?", he said.

36:42.320 --> 36:43.480
And I told him

36:45.200 --> 36:46.080
I didn’t.

36:49.440 --> 36:51.200
"And that machine is in a place

36:52.680 --> 36:54.640
called ‘Money House'.

36:55.720 --> 36:57.320
And with a plan, a master plan,

36:57.400 --> 36:59.800
it has to be a master plan,
don’t you ever forget it,

37:01.880 --> 37:03.280
someone could gain their way in

37:05.800 --> 37:07.720
and make as much money as they wanted

37:11.440 --> 37:12.880
without stealing from anyone.

37:13.600 --> 37:14.680
Do you understand?"

37:16.520 --> 37:20.400
That day he was shot multiple times
at the doors of the Hispanoamericano bank.

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
He didn’t tell me
about the plot of any film.

37:28.720 --> 37:30.800
He was narrating his own robberies.

37:34.680 --> 37:36.760
You could make your dreams come true

37:39.120 --> 37:40.640
without hurting anyone.

37:49.240 --> 37:50.280
Move!

37:51.160 --> 37:52.040
Move!

37:56.840 --> 37:58.280
"Sir, there’s some movement inside.

38:00.800 --> 38:03.040
-They’re closing the entrance."
-Covering fire.

38:03.200 --> 38:04.480
Covering fire!

38:09.640 --> 38:10.720
A pole!

38:16.040 --> 38:18.840
We need to get some poles
to make a buttress. Hurry!

38:19.280 --> 38:21.520
And Oslo! Find Oslo!

38:23.920 --> 38:25.000
Remove that.

38:28.000 --> 38:29.640
Dad, I can’t, I can’t.

38:33.480 --> 38:35.440
Damn it! Helsinki!

38:35.840 --> 38:37.000
Helsinki!

38:37.760 --> 38:38.840
Helsinki!

38:41.120 --> 38:42.880
Dad, dad, get that!

38:48.280 --> 38:50.040
I’m going to check on Helsinki! Cover me!

38:50.120 --> 38:53.560
Covering fire, be ready.
Three, two, one! Fire!

39:04.280 --> 39:05.160
Fuck!

39:11.040 --> 39:12.040
Helsinki.

39:13.560 --> 39:14.440
Help!

39:14.600 --> 39:15.600
Where, where?

39:16.160 --> 39:17.040
Where?

39:17.560 --> 39:19.760
-No, no, no.
-The vest stopped the bullet.

39:19.840 --> 39:20.840
You’re not wounded.

39:27.960 --> 39:30.000
SWAT teams, we throw smoke and we go in.

39:30.160 --> 39:31.360
Through the flanks, we’re going in.

39:32.680 --> 39:33.840
Covering fire, now.

39:41.320 --> 39:42.520
Throw the smoke at my command.

39:45.280 --> 39:46.160
Now!

39:48.640 --> 39:50.680
The SWAT have thermal imaging equipment.

39:50.840 --> 39:54.440
That smoke will block only our sight.
Take it away. Come on, Moscow!

39:55.760 --> 39:58.400
