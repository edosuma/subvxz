All right, he's right
in front of you.

01:17.033 --> 01:18.470
Straight ahead.
Straight ahead.

01:18.471 --> 01:20.042
Straight ahead.

01:20.043 --> 01:21.579
Straight ahead.

01:27.933 --> 01:29.404

<i>Unh unh unh unh</i>

01:39.335 --> 01:41.508
<i>Co-co-come on</i>

01:43.548 --> 01:45.182
<i>Have a good time</i>

01:54.458 --> 01:55.860
Morning, sweetie.

01:55.861 --> 01:57.361
How did you sleep?

01:57.362 --> 01:58.662
Not good.

01:58.663 --> 02:00.962
Tossed and turned a lot.

02:02.332 --> 02:05.134
Okay, I've gotta say this.

02:05.135 --> 02:07.503
You've been acting really
weird the last several days.

02:07.504 --> 02:09.305
Like, really nervous and on edge,

02:09.306 --> 02:11.673
so I'm thinking
either you're having

02:11.674 --> 02:13.075
second thoughts about
getting married,

02:13.076 --> 02:14.309
or there's a problem at work

02:14.310 --> 02:15.744
you're not telling me about,

02:15.745 --> 02:18.580
or, I don't know, maybe
there's someone else?

02:18.581 --> 02:20.282
Babe, come on, don't be ridiculous.

02:20.283 --> 02:22.017
Okay, well, but there's something.

02:22.018 --> 02:23.284
Because you've been like
this big sack of nerves

02:23.285 --> 02:25.286
that's all twitchy and jumpy.

02:25.287 --> 02:26.687
Honey,

02:26.688 --> 02:28.923
I'm fine.

02:28.924 --> 02:30.256
Okay?

02:47.206 --> 02:49.475
Fuck!

02:49.476 --> 02:51.810
Fuck you, cereal!

02:51.811 --> 02:53.746
Fuck you, cereal!
Fuck you, milk!

02:53.747 --> 02:55.747
Fuck you guys toge...
Fuck!

02:55.748 --> 02:57.448
Fuck! You
fucking piece of...

02:57.449 --> 02:59.751
Fuck! Shit!

02:59.752 --> 03:00.551
Fuck!

03:00.552 --> 03:03.120
In the face!
Fuck!

03:12.362 --> 03:14.831
Good afternoon, sir, hi.
My name is Luke Gordon,

03:14.832 --> 03:17.768
and I'm calling from Janitors
Bucket Cleaning Service,

03:17.769 --> 03:19.769
and I'm very excited
to be talking to you

03:19.770 --> 03:22.038
about our exceptional
cleaning system.

03:22.039 --> 03:24.473
Believe it or not, we
do have some people

03:24.474 --> 03:26.575
in your building today
dealing with other clients,

03:26.576 --> 03:27.976
and I was wondering...

03:29.778 --> 03:30.978
No.

03:32.113 --> 03:33.814
No, there's no Janet here.

03:34.416 --> 03:36.017
Janitor.

03:36.018 --> 03:38.752
Yeah, it's Janitors Bucket
Cleaning Service, and...

03:40.754 --> 03:42.756
Well, I can't take a
message for someone

03:42.757 --> 03:45.258
who doesn't exist...
I'm calling you.

03:47.227 --> 03:49.029
Sir, no, I can't...

03:49.030 --> 03:52.231
No, there's no Janet.
I can't...

03:52.232 --> 03:55.568
Go ahead. Mm-hmm.

03:55.569 --> 03:59.105
Yeah. Yeah, I'll have her
call you, Fred. Bye!

03:59.106 --> 04:01.173
Oh, shoot me in the face.

04:05.243 --> 04:07.212
It's this stupid stag.

04:07.213 --> 04:08.580
Wait, your stag?

04:08.581 --> 04:10.582
How can that be bothering you?

04:10.583 --> 04:12.985
I thought that was, like,
every guy's dream.

04:12.986 --> 04:15.753
Okay, babe, you've got a
great group of friends

04:15.754 --> 04:17.555
that you've known since
you were, what, 16?

04:17.555 --> 04:19.190
And I'm sure they're
anxious to see you tonight

04:19.190 --> 04:23.060
and, you know, be part of this
special, memorable event.

04:23.061 --> 04:24.428
Yeah, I bet they are.

04:24.429 --> 04:26.628
So then why wouldn't
you be excited about it?

04:28.765 --> 04:31.201
Two years ago, I organized a group

04:31.202 --> 04:35.772
that got Jason Albright
so drunk he passed out.

04:35.773 --> 04:38.273
We stripped him buck naked

04:38.274 --> 04:40.476
and then covered his ass in ice.

04:40.477 --> 04:42.544
Ohh!

04:42.545 --> 04:45.280
I then cut off the
top of a pineapple,

04:45.281 --> 04:47.582
wedged that bad boy
into the crack of his ass

04:47.583 --> 04:49.450
so it looked
like the whole pineapple

04:49.451 --> 04:50.752
was shoved into his butt

04:50.753 --> 04:52.487
and just the leaves
were sticking out.

04:52.488 --> 04:53.821
I took a picture of it,

04:53.822 --> 04:57.325
and then I circulated it
around the office.

04:57.326 --> 04:59.026
Okay, now you're
just making that up.

04:59.027 --> 05:00.627
You think I'm making this up?

05:00.628 --> 05:02.796
Mm-hmm.
You think this is...

05:02.797 --> 05:06.066
Okay, I'm gonna show you
what I'm making up.

05:06.067 --> 05:07.766
Here.

05:09.036 --> 05:09.935
Bam!

05:09.936 --> 05:11.470
Oh!
It's my screen saver!

05:11.471 --> 05:14.040
Oh! Oh, my God!

05:14.041 --> 05:17.709
Yeah! I'm screwed!

05:24.282 --> 05:25.717
Payback's a bitch, huh?

05:25.718 --> 05:26.951
Rory, what are you doing?

05:26.952 --> 05:28.286
You know what
I have planned for Ken?

05:28.287 --> 05:29.487
It's friggin' brilliant.

05:29.488 --> 05:31.256
No, I don't know, and, uh,

05:31.257 --> 05:33.123
I'm not really
that concerned, so...

05:33.124 --> 05:35.459
Wa-wait, you're going
to the stag, right?

05:35.460 --> 05:37.461
No, I don't think so.

05:37.462 --> 05:39.029
I mean, I've got
a lot of work to do.

05:39.030 --> 05:40.664
I've got to get through
these cold calls, so...

05:40.665 --> 05:43.733
Okay, so you don't want
to go to the stag, or...?

05:43.734 --> 05:45.334
Are you kidding me?

05:45.335 --> 05:46.869
The last time I saw a vagina,

05:46.870 --> 05:49.038
it was when my daughter
was coming out of it.

05:49.039 --> 05:50.940
Your daughter's 6.

05:50.941 --> 05:52.542
I know.

05:52.543 --> 05:53.742
You need to come to this!

05:53.743 --> 05:55.177
I don't know.
I just...

05:55.178 --> 05:57.112
Come on, man, hang with the
boys like the old days.

05:57.113 --> 06:00.015
You know, just forget about your
responsibilities for a few hours.

06:00.016 --> 06:02.150
This is our chance
to prank the prankster.

06:02.151 --> 06:03.151
It's gonna be the best!

06:03.152 --> 06:04.686
I don't know.

06:04.687 --> 06:05.986
I mean, I really do
have some work to do,

06:05.987 --> 06:08.456
and Liz is not gonna
want me to go, okay?

06:08.457 --> 06:10.724
She doesn't mind me going out
with the guys and having beers,

06:10.725 --> 06:12.126
but she's not gonna like

06:12.127 --> 06:13.661
the fact that there's
a stripper there...

06:13.662 --> 06:14.962
What are you doing?

06:14.963 --> 06:16.062
I'm looking for where
you put your balls.

06:16.063 --> 06:17.897
Funny.
Are they in your files?

06:17.898 --> 06:20.200
No, check your mouth.
Probably in your mouth again.

06:20.201 --> 06:22.836
No, not in my mouth. They're not on
your body, I'll tell you that much.

06:22.837 --> 06:24.471
Dude, you're burned out, all right?

06:24.472 --> 06:26.172
You need to take a break.

06:26.173 --> 06:27.706
Give yourself a few hours.

06:27.707 --> 06:30.209
Just drink some beers,
you know, see some 'tang!

06:30.210 --> 06:31.810
Then you'll come back in
tomorrow morning a new man.

06:31.811 --> 06:34.045
You'll knock the fucking lid
off these things!

06:34.913 --> 06:36.849
Maybe, yeah.

06:36.850 --> 06:40.751
So, um, who actually did
the pineapple placing

06:40.752 --> 06:42.019
in Jason's buttocks?

06:42.020 --> 06:44.489
Honey, it wasn't
the whole pineapple.

06:44.490 --> 06:46.457
It was just the top with
the leaves sticking out.

06:46.458 --> 06:48.226
Okay, but who actually did it?

06:48.227 --> 06:50.026
I don't know. I think we
drew straws or something

06:50.027 --> 06:53.130
So did the winner get
to do it or the loser?

06:53.131 --> 06:54.798
What are you doing?

06:54.799 --> 06:56.867
Why are you asking me this?
Don't you get it?

06:56.868 --> 06:58.935
By the end of the night,
I could be tied up

06:58.936 --> 07:01.070
and gagged on a train
to Pittsburgh!

07:01.071 --> 07:03.472
Either that or I could
wake up in an ice bath

07:03.473 --> 07:04.740
without my kidney!

07:04.741 --> 07:06.942
So then why don't
you just not drink?

07:06.943 --> 07:09.545
Stay on guard all night so
nobody can do anything to you.

07:09.546 --> 07:11.147
Not drink at my own stag?

07:11.148 --> 07:12.514
What are you, nuts?

07:12.515 --> 07:13.948
You don't get it, do you?

07:13.949 --> 07:16.017
No!
No, I don't get it.

07:16.018 --> 07:18.520
I mean, I don't understand
why you can't just go

07:18.521 --> 07:20.021
to a movie with your friends
for your stag.

07:20.022 --> 07:22.423
Something really actiony
with someone like Brad Pitt.

07:22.424 --> 07:24.591
What, are you crazy?

07:24.592 --> 07:26.960
Oh, sorry! I'm crazy?

07:26.961 --> 07:29.463
You're shoving a pineapple up
some guy's ass, and I'm crazy?

07:29.464 --> 07:32.633
It wasn't the whole pineapple!
Don't you yell at me!

07:32.634 --> 07:34.634
I would never shove a pineapple...

07:34.635 --> 07:35.935
It's impossible!

07:35.936 --> 07:38.371
It's impossible to shove

07:38.372 --> 07:41.174
a pineapple up a man's ass!

07:41.175 --> 07:42.441
I said don't yell!

07:42.442 --> 07:43.943
It was the...
'Cause it...

07:43.944 --> 07:45.610
Forget it! Let's just
forget it, okay?

07:45.611 --> 07:46.845
You know what,
if you're so worried,

07:46.846 --> 07:48.513
why don't you ask
your dad or a friend

07:48.514 --> 07:50.549
to keep their eye out for danger?

07:50.550 --> 07:51.616
I did.
I asked Carl.

07:51.617 --> 07:54.452
Carl? What?
You asked Carl?

07:54.453 --> 07:56.587
What's wrong with Carl?

07:56.588 --> 07:58.389
That is the same question
all my friends ask

07:58.390 --> 07:59.590
whenever they meet him.

07:59.591 --> 08:01.258
"What the hell
is wrong with Carl?"

08:10.733 --> 08:13.135
Take me to the basement.

08:14.404 --> 08:16.272
<i>You were awesome in Tiger Bait.</i>

08:16.273 --> 08:18.707
- What did you say?
- Cut!

08:18.708 --> 08:20.941
What'd you say?

08:27.716 --> 08:29.151
Listen, Clark...

08:29.152 --> 08:30.218
It's actually Carl.

08:30.219 --> 08:32.019
Yeah, um, you gonna be okay here?

08:32.020 --> 08:33.486
You sure you can
handle this all right?

08:33.488 --> 08:36.190
Hey, Gus, dude, I'm an actor.

08:36.191 --> 08:38.226
I can do this shit
standing on my head.

08:38.227 --> 08:40.027
Okay, great.
But we did tell you

08:40.028 --> 08:41.461
that Veronica likes to
keep to herself, right?

08:41.462 --> 08:43.630
Oh, yeah, I know.
Right.

08:43.631 --> 08:45.498
Right.
Okay.

08:45.499 --> 08:46.800
<i>It's just Tiger Bait's</i>

08:46.801 --> 08:50.070
one of my all-time
favorite movies, so...

08:50.071 --> 08:51.404
Okay.

08:51.405 --> 08:53.038
Have you seen Tiger Bait?

08:53.039 --> 08:55.007
Uh, yeah.

08:55.008 --> 08:57.676
Yeah, I've seen it, but,
um, I'm more concerned

08:57.677 --> 08:59.478
about making this movie right now,

08:59.479 --> 09:01.747
so if you can't handle it
just let me know.

09:01.748 --> 09:03.147
I can get someone else here.

09:03.148 --> 09:05.216
No, wouldn't want you
to go to all that trouble.

09:05.217 --> 09:06.851
It's actually no trouble.
We just need to find someone

09:06.852 --> 09:08.553
that can fit into that suit,
and then you're gone.

09:08.554 --> 09:10.388
I'm good.

09:10.389 --> 09:11.389
You're sure now?

09:11.390 --> 09:12.824
Totally sure.

09:12.825 --> 09:14.891
Okay, great, 'cause
if you fuck up again,

09:14.892 --> 09:16.460
I will personally
drag you off this set

09:16.461 --> 09:19.029
by your hair, okay?

09:19.030 --> 09:21.030
All good! Yeah.
Okay.

09:21.865 --> 09:23.500
Oh, and, Clark?
Carl.

09:23.501 --> 09:24.935
Easy on the door, okay?

09:24.936 --> 09:27.068
All right, let's pick that up.

09:31.040 --> 09:32.441
Shutting the gate too hard.

09:32.442 --> 09:35.076
- I work out, so...
- Clark!

09:40.815 --> 09:42.183
Well, that's everything.

09:42.184 --> 09:43.184
Yep.

09:43.185 --> 09:44.519
But, Sarah, I just...

09:44.520 --> 09:47.222
Oh, gosh, Henry, don't.

09:47.223 --> 09:48.989
Don't do this, okay?

09:48.990 --> 09:51.325
These things,
they happen all the time,

09:51.326 --> 09:54.194
and the best thing to do
is just to...

09:54.195 --> 09:55.696
just to move on.

09:55.697 --> 09:57.498
But I live here.

09:57.499 --> 10:00.833
Yeah, okay, you know what?

10:00.834 --> 10:02.435
Don't worry.

10:02.436 --> 10:03.903
It's gonna be okay.

10:03.904 --> 10:06.806
I'm sure you're gonna meet someone,

10:06.807 --> 10:09.242
you know, 'cause you're just...

10:09.243 --> 10:13.944
You're just a really...
nice guy.

10:20.218 --> 10:21.752
You need to come to this!

10:21.753 --> 10:24.422
Okay, I'll go.

10:24.423 --> 10:25.656
Yes! Yes!
Yes, you will!

10:25.657 --> 10:26.957
Okay, fantastic.

10:26.958 --> 10:28.726
I'm gonna need you
to pick up the stripper.

10:28.727 --> 10:29.994
Whoa, what?

10:29.995 --> 10:31.062
Yeah, the stripper I hired,

10:31.063 --> 10:32.162
she has no way of getting there.

10:32.163 --> 10:33.496
And?
I need you to pick her up.

10:33.497 --> 10:34.597
Why don't you pick her up?

10:34.598 --> 10:35.799
On my bike?
Oh, my God.

10:35.800 --> 10:37.067
I don't have a license, Luke.

10:37.068 --> 10:38.868
Do you know why
I don't have a license?

10:38.869 --> 10:40.704
Yes, I know, Rory.
I'll tell you why I don't have a license.

10:40.705 --> 10:42.339
Because after my stag,
thanks to Ken,

10:42.340 --> 10:44.039
I no longer have
a sense of depth perception,

10:44.040 --> 10:46.375
and therefore am not allowed
behind the wheel of a car.

10:46.376 --> 10:48.110
I get it, all right, but
that was four years ago,

10:48.111 --> 10:49.445
and you gotta get over it.

10:49.446 --> 10:51.180
Oh! Oh!
Make no mistake,

10:51.181 --> 10:52.948
I know exactly how long ago it was,

10:52.949 --> 10:55.783
and now the universe has
aligned itself to afford me

10:55.784 --> 10:57.018
the opportunity to show Ken

10:57.019 --> 10:58.619
the same respect that he showed me.

10:58.620 --> 11:01.723
And I intend to. So if you
would please be so kind,

11:01.724 --> 11:03.024
please, pretty fucking please,

11:03.025 --> 11:04.459
pick up the fucking stripper!

11:04.460 --> 11:06.893
Okay, I will. But first,
I have to call my wife,

11:06.894 --> 11:08.595
and I have to lie to her,

11:08.596 --> 11:10.030
and that's something I'm not
comfortable doing, okay?

11:10.031 --> 11:11.231
So if you'll excuse me...

11:11.232 --> 11:13.567
That is fantastic.
Say hi for me.

11:13.568 --> 11:14.935
Her name's Candy.

11:14.936 --> 11:16.436
Seriously, I'm picking up a Candy?

11:16.437 --> 11:17.436
Yeah.
Here's the address.

11:17.437 --> 11:18.704
Fucking depth perception.

11:18.705 --> 11:20.139
Okay, this is the address

11:20.140 --> 11:21.507
of the club she works at
during the day, okay?

11:21.508 --> 11:23.709
Now I have to go.
I'm masterminding the prank

11:23.710 --> 11:25.111
and assigning tasks to the guys.

11:25.112 --> 11:26.645
Speaking of which,
do you have any Viagra?

11:26.646 --> 11:28.179
No, not on me.

11:28.180 --> 11:29.547
Okay, well, search continues.

11:29.548 --> 11:30.849
Hey, sweetie, how are you?

11:30.850 --> 11:32.450
Now, Candy's expecting
you to pick her up

11:32.451 --> 11:33.918
at the strip club at 5:00
sharp, so don't be late, okay?

11:33.919 --> 11:35.286
Okay.
See you tonight?

11:35.287 --> 11:36.421
Yes.

11:36.422 --> 11:37.956
Sweetie... Sorry. Hold on
for one more sec.

11:37.957 --> 11:42.192
Excuse me, 5:00?
The stag is not until 7:00!

11:42.193 --> 11:44.528
What am I gonna do with a stripper

11:44.529 --> 11:46.696
for two fuckin' hours?!

11:56.539 --> 11:58.241
You okay?

11:58.242 --> 11:59.509
Two years.

11:59.510 --> 12:01.009
Ah, fuck her.

12:01.010 --> 12:03.645
All women are a pain in the ass.

12:03.646 --> 12:05.013
Two years, Paul.

12:05.014 --> 12:06.948
I know, I know, it's shitty.

12:06.949 --> 12:09.017
It's shitty.
Plus, I don't like it

12:09.018 --> 12:10.819
when people fuck with my friends.

12:10.820 --> 12:11.820
Thanks.

12:11.821 --> 12:13.821
Yeah.
Now let's just...

12:13.822 --> 12:15.823
We'll go get drunk
before the stag, okay?

12:15.824 --> 12:16.824
You'll feel better.

12:16.825 --> 12:18.291
Okay.

12:20.561 --> 12:22.229
She's watching.

12:22.230 --> 12:24.631
You think she's having second
thoughts?

12:24.632 --> 12:25.932
I don't know.
I don't know.

12:25.933 --> 12:27.967
I don't know, but you know what?

12:27.968 --> 12:29.235
You know what?

12:29.236 --> 12:31.171
Now's your chance
to leave with pride.

12:31.172 --> 12:33.840
Let her watch you leave.

12:33.841 --> 12:36.942
Let her wonder
if she made the mistake.

12:36.943 --> 12:37.943
Right.
Right?

12:37.944 --> 12:38.944
Yeah. Pride.

12:38.945 --> 12:40.145
Yeah.
Right.

12:40.146 --> 12:41.880
Yeah.

12:44.050 --> 12:45.917
What the fuck are you doing?

12:45.918 --> 12:48.219
I don't know.

12:48.220 --> 12:49.887
Aw, this is fuckin' embarrassing.

12:49.888 --> 12:51.389
I know.

12:51.390 --> 12:53.558
"Park, Brights..."

12:53.559 --> 12:54.792
Who's that?

12:55.961 --> 12:57.794
Aw, cripes.
That's him.

13:03.533 --> 13:05.235
Son of a...

13:05.236 --> 13:07.637
Wow.
He's pretty cool.

13:07.638 --> 13:09.538
Oh.

13:11.074 --> 13:13.843
I don't think she's
having second thoughts.

13:13.844 --> 13:15.411
Not only are you fired,

13:15.412 --> 13:17.079
the second he un-jams
this door,

13:17.080 --> 13:18.347
I'm gonna wring your fuckin' neck.

13:18.348 --> 13:20.348
Hey, man, I said
I was sorry, okay?

13:20.349 --> 13:22.851
I was just in character,
and I slammed it.

13:22.852 --> 13:24.519
Character?
You're an extra!

13:24.520 --> 13:27.689
You're a sack of meat that
happened to fit the damn jumpsuit!

13:27.690 --> 13:29.224
Hey, man, I'm an actor.

13:29.225 --> 13:30.524
I was just
in the moment, you know?

13:30.525 --> 13:31.859
So sue me.

13:31.860 --> 13:33.727
Oh, we're already
drawing up the paperwork.

13:33.728 --> 13:36.262
Okay, so you can sue me.

13:37.564 --> 13:40.734
Well, the spring is busted.

13:40.735 --> 13:44.036
The frame is jammed
into the concrete base.

13:44.037 --> 13:45.638
So how long?

13:45.639 --> 13:47.940
You know, they don't really
make them like this anymore.

13:47.941 --> 13:49.275
I gotta get a guy

13:49.276 --> 13:51.844
to come in from another
district, so if we...

13:51.845 --> 13:53.712
How long?

13:53.713 --> 13:55.046
At least three hours.

13:55.047 --> 13:57.382
Oh, well that is just great!

13:57.383 --> 13:58.617
Great!

13:58.618 --> 14:01.887
All right, guys, uh,
we'll be taking

14:01.888 --> 14:04.488
a three-hour break.
Looks like, uh...

14:04.489 --> 14:05.689
we're gonna be
working into the night

14:05.690 --> 14:06.991
to make up for lost time.

14:14.499 --> 14:18.868
Hey, can someone just grab my
cell phone from my jacket?

14:20.371 --> 14:23.406
It's over there in my jacket.

14:23.407 --> 14:25.074
Carl!
What the fuck man?

14:25.075 --> 14:27.042
This is like the fifth message
I left for you.

14:27.043 --> 14:28.810
I'm starting
to freak out over here.

14:28.811 --> 14:30.579
I just need to make sure
that you're gonna be there

14:30.580 --> 14:33.781
for me tonight, all right?
I'm counting on you.

14:35.584 --> 14:36.585
Good night, Ken.

14:36.586 --> 14:38.052
Oh, God! Aah!

14:38.053 --> 14:40.855
Jesus, Mary,
what's the matter with you?

14:40.856 --> 14:42.256
Are you okay?

14:42.257 --> 14:44.525
You've been acting
really weird all day.

14:44.526 --> 14:45.560
I need to talk to you.

14:45.561 --> 14:46.627
No, no, no, no.

14:46.628 --> 14:48.295
Yes, yes, yes.
I really do have to go.

14:48.296 --> 14:50.896
Listen to me.
It is your job.

14:57.304 --> 14:59.338
We've been working
together for a while now.

14:59.339 --> 15:00.739
What's it been, two years?

15:00.740 --> 15:02.241
Four years.

15:02.242 --> 15:04.543
And you are definitely qualified

15:04.544 --> 15:06.712
to answer this question
because you know me.

15:06.713 --> 15:09.481
Oh, I don't think I like
where this is going.

15:09.482 --> 15:10.949
You have a tendency
to speak you mind a lot.

15:10.950 --> 15:12.317
We both know this.

15:12.318 --> 15:14.118
It's gotten you in trouble
quite a few times.

15:14.119 --> 15:16.321
I really don't like
where this is going.

15:16.322 --> 15:17.622
So I'm gonna ask you this,

15:17.623 --> 15:19.290
and I want you to be
completely honest with me.

15:19.291 --> 15:23.259
I need you to be
point blank, all right?

15:24.061 --> 15:25.596
Am I a dick?

15:25.597 --> 15:26.897
Yes.

15:26.898 --> 15:29.600
No, I'm...
That was the question.

15:29.601 --> 15:30.601
I'm asking you.

15:30.602 --> 15:32.468
Ken, you're a dick.

15:32.469 --> 15:34.337
You're the kind of dick who
thinks he's a funny dick,

15:34.338 --> 15:36.439
so he pulls jackass dick pranks

15:36.440 --> 15:37.740
on his friends and coworkers

15:37.741 --> 15:39.008
that really only get laughs

15:39.009 --> 15:41.544
out of the other dicks
in the office.

15:41.545 --> 15:43.346
Well, that is until
those dicks are sitting

15:43.347 --> 15:44.746
having their dick lunch
at the dick table

15:44.747 --> 15:47.082
with their dick friends
shaking their dick heads

15:47.083 --> 15:51.753
in amazement at what a bigger
dick you are than all of them.

15:51.754 --> 15:54.855
So, yes, Ken, you are a dick.

15:54.856 --> 15:56.256
Cool?

15:56.257 --> 15:57.725
Yeah, thank you very much.

16:00.829 --> 16:02.528
<i>Just come on</i>

16:04.331 --> 16:06.531
<i>Here we go now</i>

16:09.102 --> 16:11.403
Come on, it's 5:00.

16:14.073 --> 16:18.008
Oh, shit, shit, shit,
shit, shit, shit.

16:18.877 --> 16:20.479
Oh, shit, shit!
Luke?

16:20.480 --> 16:21.346
Shit, shit!

16:21.347 --> 16:22.547
Luke!
Shit, shit.

16:22.548 --> 16:24.515
It's me, Marsha!

16:26.618 --> 16:28.786
Hi!
Hey, Marsha.

16:28.787 --> 16:29.920
How are you?

16:29.921 --> 16:31.288
Good!

16:31.289 --> 16:33.257
We're just coming back
from Busy Bee.

16:33.258 --> 16:35.159
You know, you guys have
to take Isabelle there.

16:35.160 --> 16:36.460
It is so cathartic.

16:36.461 --> 16:38.896
Yeah, well, you know what?
We will make a date.

16:38.897 --> 16:40.163
I'll tell Liz, and we'll all go.

16:40.164 --> 16:41.164
So, good to see you.

16:41.165 --> 16:42.599
Yes!
Yeah, yeah.

16:42.600 --> 16:45.201
Uh, what brings you
to this neck of the woods?

16:57.112 --> 16:59.915
Shopping. Shopping.

16:59.916 --> 17:01.350
For, uh, Liz.

17:01.351 --> 17:04.252
Shopping for Liz,
because I love her so much.

17:04.252 --> 17:06.487
That is the sweetest thing ever.

17:06.488 --> 17:07.320
Isn't it?

17:07.321 --> 17:09.589
Hi. Are you Luke?

17:09.590 --> 17:12.060
No. No!

17:12.060 --> 17:13.694
No. Yes!
I'm Luke.

17:13.694 --> 17:17.029
I'm not the Luke that she...
Oh.

17:38.950 --> 17:42.719
So celebrities read
those magazines, too, huh?

17:44.789 --> 17:46.123
Cool.

17:46.124 --> 17:48.124
Totally cool.

17:49.259 --> 17:51.428
You ever...

17:51.429 --> 17:53.596
read any articles
about yourself in there?

17:56.366 --> 17:59.100
Yeah, course, you probably do.

18:00.002 --> 18:01.870
That must be cool.

18:03.039 --> 18:05.174
I'd love to be
in a magazine like that.

18:05.175 --> 18:07.844
Love it.

18:07.845 --> 18:09.510
Be awesome.

18:10.245 --> 18:13.115
Oh, except, of course,

18:13.116 --> 18:14.950
that whole thing when you

18:14.951 --> 18:19.119
went out and you didn't
have any underwear on.

18:20.421 --> 18:22.889
They got those pictures.

18:24.158 --> 18:27.261
That sucked, but...

18:27.262 --> 18:29.096
Ever since then,
I always make sure

18:29.097 --> 18:30.563
I have underpants on when I go out.

18:30.564 --> 18:31.965
Okay, you know what?

18:31.966 --> 18:33.633
Why don't you just stay over there

18:33.634 --> 18:35.034
on your side of the elevator,

18:35.035 --> 18:36.336
and I'll stay right here
on my side,

18:36.337 --> 18:38.638
and we'll just be
as quiet as we can be

18:38.639 --> 18:40.406
until the guy comes
to let us out, okay?

18:40.407 --> 18:43.275
Yeah.
Yeah, totally.

18:43.276 --> 18:44.610
Totally cool.

18:44.611 --> 18:46.678
Should, um...

18:46.679 --> 18:49.114
Should work on
my screenplay anyway.

18:49.115 --> 18:50.983
Kinda my passion right now.

18:50.984 --> 18:53.217
Oh, my God.

18:58.023 --> 18:59.957
That is when my dad walked in

18:59.958 --> 19:02.126
and literally caught us

19:02.127 --> 19:04.094
rolling the joints
in the moment, so...

19:04.095 --> 19:05.829
Yeah, awkward.

19:05.830 --> 19:09.132
That's hilarious.
How long ago was that?

19:09.133 --> 19:11.900
Oh, jeez, um...

19:12.702 --> 19:15.037
Wow. 17 years ago.

19:15.038 --> 19:17.673
Oh, wow.
17 years ago.

19:17.674 --> 19:19.875
I was 6 when that happened,

19:19.876 --> 19:23.045
which is the same age as your...

19:23.046 --> 19:24.780
Same age as my daughter.

19:24.781 --> 19:26.081
Wow.

19:26.082 --> 19:27.814
Hmm.

19:28.583 --> 19:30.919
I mean, my dad's, you know...

19:30.920 --> 19:33.388
He's usually pretty...
What are you doing?

19:33.389 --> 19:36.691
Oh, I'm a bit of a Web nerd.

19:36.692 --> 19:38.125
Yeah.

19:38.126 --> 19:40.828
So, you're married?

19:40.829 --> 19:41.895
Yes.

19:41.896 --> 19:43.630
Happily married?

19:43.631 --> 19:45.299
Yeah.

19:45.300 --> 19:47.100
Yeah. Yes.

19:47.101 --> 19:49.335
I mean, yeah.
I mean, every...

19:49.336 --> 19:52.371
Every marriage goes
through a difficult period,

19:52.372 --> 19:55.575
and you just work through the...

19:55.576 --> 19:58.177
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I'm-I'm-I'm happily married.

19:58.178 --> 19:59.278
Yeah.

19:59.279 --> 20:02.046
Do you... ever play?

20:09.087 --> 20:10.155
Sports?

20:14.792 --> 20:16.927
Oh, I should probably
get you downstairs,

20:16.928 --> 20:20.064
you know, 'cause you gotta get, um...
Right.

20:20.065 --> 20:21.265
stripping... Um...

20:21.266 --> 20:22.432
Are you gonna be warm enough?

20:22.433 --> 20:23.733
when you're down there, you think?

20:23.734 --> 20:26.102
Aw, for fuck's sake, Henry!

20:26.103 --> 20:27.837
People grow apart!

20:27.838 --> 20:29.739
Besides, that guy's
nothing like you, right?

20:29.740 --> 20:32.908
He's a total badass, and
you're a fuckin' sweetheart.

20:32.909 --> 20:35.911
Yeah. God, I wish
I was more like you.

20:35.912 --> 20:37.279
Sure.

20:37.280 --> 20:39.748
This tough-skinned guy that
never lets anything get to him.

20:39.749 --> 20:42.618
Ah, I know.

20:42.619 --> 20:45.419
What kind of woman wants a tough
guy, bad boy like that anyway?

20:45.420 --> 20:47.221
Exactly. Pfft!

20:47.222 --> 20:49.457
See the truck?
Piece of shit.

20:49.458 --> 20:50.725
Tough on gas, I bet.

20:50.726 --> 20:52.727
Fuck it!
Let him have her, right?

20:52.728 --> 20:54.328
You just need to find somebody

20:54.329 --> 20:56.129
who suits you, that's all.

20:56.130 --> 20:57.330
For who I am.

20:57.331 --> 20:59.299
Yeah.

20:59.300 --> 21:00.567
Or I could become tough.

21:00.568 --> 21:02.569
Oh, for fuck's sake.

21:02.570 --> 21:04.269
Like Jason Statham.

21:07.506 --> 21:09.174
Why not?

21:09.175 --> 21:10.509
Why not?

21:10.510 --> 21:12.278
Because you can't
just become tough, Henry.

21:12.279 --> 21:13.879
You know, you're just kinda...

21:13.880 --> 21:15.648
You're born with it.
You have it, or you don't.

21:15.649 --> 21:18.316
What you gotta do is just focus
all your fuckin' energy

21:18.317 --> 21:21.452
on finding a woman
who loves you for you.

21:21.453 --> 21:25.123
But who I am never gets
the woman he wants.

21:25.124 --> 21:26.858
I should rethink who I am.

21:26.859 --> 21:28.859
Jesus, can we just
get fucking drunk, okay?

21:28.860 --> 21:31.295
And drop all
this psycho mumbo jumbo.

21:31.296 --> 21:32.863
What's with your chest?

21:32.864 --> 21:34.498
I think I pulled
a muscle trying to lift

21:34.499 --> 21:37.100
your fucking spirits all day.
Now let's get drunk!

21:37.101 --> 21:38.568
Hang on. Hang on.
What?

21:38.569 --> 21:40.736
Just another question.

21:40.737 --> 21:42.371
I should probably warn you
that these guys

21:42.372 --> 21:44.240
can get a little wild.

21:44.241 --> 21:46.175
I've been drinking with most
of them since high school,

21:46.176 --> 21:47.877
and you know what?

21:47.878 --> 21:51.313
A few of them can get a
little crazy. Just a heads up.

21:51.314 --> 21:53.415
Am I safe?

21:53.416 --> 21:54.683
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, sure.

21:54.684 --> 21:57.719
I mean, I think
you should be fine.

21:57.720 --> 21:59.120
Great.

21:59.121 --> 22:01.623
Don't worry about it.
I'll keep my eyes on you.

22:01.624 --> 22:03.290
Ahem. I mean, not
when you're stripping.

22:03.291 --> 22:04.725
I don't mean that
to be creepy at all.

22:04.726 --> 22:06.527
Like, I'll wash your back.
Watch your back.

22:06.528 --> 22:08.662
You're clean. I don't
need to wash your back.

22:08.663 --> 22:10.731
I don't want the guys
to see me like this.

22:10.732 --> 22:13.533
Say something nice.
Boost my spirits.

22:13.534 --> 22:15.268
Your hair looks great.

22:15.269 --> 22:16.369
Thank you.

22:16.370 --> 22:18.538
Like a...
Like a sports guy.

22:18.539 --> 22:22.007
Yes. See? Was that so hard?
Let's go.

22:23.743 --> 22:25.978
I'll see you downstairs.

22:25.979 --> 22:27.279
Aah!

22:27.280 --> 22:28.780
Oh, my God!

22:29.582 --> 22:30.816
Oh, my God!

22:30.817 --> 22:32.317
Let's tickle this Wild Turkey!

22:32.318 --> 22:33.652
Ah ha ha!

22:33.653 --> 22:34.953
Oh... what's up?

22:34.954 --> 22:36.921
Surprised the wife
let you out tonight.

22:36.922 --> 22:39.490
Please, like I need to ask
permission to leave my home.

22:39.491 --> 22:41.791
Did you tell her
you're working late?

22:43.327 --> 22:45.062
Surprised you're out, eh?

22:45.063 --> 22:47.430
Thought this guy'd be home
begging for a pity fuck.

22:52.402 --> 22:54.069
What?

22:55.238 --> 22:56.573
See you guys downstairs.

22:56.574 --> 22:59.541
Yeah. Yep, we'll
see you down there, Henry.

22:59.542 --> 23:01.410
What's going on?

23:01.411 --> 23:02.778
Nice.

23:02.779 --> 23:03.645
What'd I do?

23:03.646 --> 23:05.147
Fucking guy got dumped today.

23:05.148 --> 23:06.915
Oh, my God, again?

23:06.916 --> 23:08.183
Yeah. Poor fucker.

23:08.184 --> 23:10.451
I've been listening to him
piss and moan all day.

23:10.452 --> 23:13.354
Aw, jeez. Well...

23:13.355 --> 23:17.492
who knows, I mean, maybe now he'll
finally realize the truth, huh?

23:17.493 --> 23:20.293
The truth.
The truth about what?

23:20.294 --> 23:22.062
Hello? He's gay.

23:22.063 --> 23:22.996
What?

23:22.997 --> 23:24.531
What the fuck
are you talking about?

23:24.532 --> 23:25.899
Henry's not gay.

23:25.900 --> 23:27.634
Are you serious?
You've never thought...

23:27.635 --> 23:29.836
No! No! I think
you're fucking gay

23:29.837 --> 23:31.404
for thinking
that he's fucking gay!

23:31.405 --> 23:33.706
That dude has been my best
friend since grade four, Luke!

23:33.707 --> 23:35.374
Grade fucking four!

23:35.375 --> 23:38.744
And as you know, I'm not a big
fuckin' fan of the homos!

23:38.745 --> 23:40.713
Easy, okay. Homophobic.

23:40.714 --> 23:43.114
Easy. I'm sorry, all right?
I just thought...

23:43.115 --> 23:44.416
No, you didn't think.

23:44.417 --> 23:46.384
That's the problem.
You didn't think.

23:46.385 --> 23:49.254
Just 'cause the guy's got a
little bit of a pussy handicap,

23:49.255 --> 23:51.689
that doesn't automatically
make him a faggot, you know.

23:51.690 --> 23:53.724
Okay, all right,
I'm sorry, all right?

23:53.725 --> 23:55.926
Fine.
Let's go.

23:55.927 --> 23:57.961
By the way, faggot?
Not so PC anymore.

23:57.962 --> 23:59.797
<i>One of the money, two for the show</i>

23:59.798 --> 24:02.633
<i>Three to get ready,
four for the dough</i>

24:05.803 --> 24:07.369
Luke!

24:08.337 --> 24:11.607
So, no sign of Ken or Carl.

24:11.608 --> 24:12.942
Hey, look, Henry, I'm really sorry

24:12.943 --> 24:14.510
about what I said upstairs,
all right?

24:14.511 --> 24:17.112
So, can we just let that go,
bust loose tonight?

24:17.113 --> 24:18.647
Hey, did you guys bring
the stencil?

24:18.648 --> 24:19.981
No, we didn't.

24:19.982 --> 24:22.216
God damn it!
Okay, what about the Viagra?

24:23.318 --> 24:25.720
Oh, come on.

24:25.721 --> 24:27.320
Okay, let me think.

24:29.457 --> 24:31.092
Just like old times, huh, boys?

24:31.093 --> 24:33.627
Huh? Have some drinks,
get a little crazy,

24:33.628 --> 24:35.029
maybe prank Ken,

24:35.030 --> 24:37.565
and then we'll
definitely see some pussy!

24:37.566 --> 24:39.799
Uncle Luke?

24:39.800 --> 24:41.601
Pam.

24:41.602 --> 24:43.136
What are you...

24:43.137 --> 24:46.372
I had a... I was just here
for a dinner up...

24:46.373 --> 24:48.108
A business dinner upstairs.

24:48.109 --> 24:50.876
Yeah. Then I just came down
to use the bathroom.

24:50.877 --> 24:53.846
So... yeah, these are
friends I ran into.

24:53.847 --> 24:54.947
Hey.

24:54.948 --> 24:57.616
Yeah, it's good.
You're working here?

24:57.617 --> 25:01.085
Well, that's good.
How's Mom? How's your mom?

25:03.622 --> 25:05.422
<i>Okay</i>

25:10.328 --> 25:11.595
Rory! Psst!

25:11.596 --> 25:13.263
You seen Carl?

25:13.264 --> 25:14.965
Hey, look! Ken's here!

25:17.935 --> 25:18.768
Oh, hey!

25:18.769 --> 25:20.170
There he is!

25:20.171 --> 25:22.338
The man taking
the death march, huh?

25:23.874 --> 25:24.940
Holy shit.

25:24.941 --> 25:26.775
Where's Carl?
Have you seen... Carl!

25:26.776 --> 25:28.611
Look, People are gonna
be looking for me!

25:28.612 --> 25:30.246
No, no, no, like you're
walking down the aisle,

25:30.247 --> 25:31.580
getting married.

25:31.581 --> 25:33.149
You're taking
the death march, okay?

25:33.150 --> 25:34.349
The death march?

25:34.350 --> 25:35.917
Oh!

25:35.918 --> 25:37.519
Scared! Scared!

25:37.520 --> 25:39.154
Shut up, okay?

25:39.155 --> 25:41.422
'Cause I know why you guys
are here, all right?

25:41.423 --> 25:42.724
I'm gonna tell
you something right now,

25:42.725 --> 25:44.958
whatever you've concocted
to fuck me up,

25:44.959 --> 25:47.628
it's not gonna work.
It's not gonna work!

25:47.629 --> 25:50.764
'Cause I'm gonna be
on point like a sniper.

25:50.765 --> 25:51.965
I am going to be...

25:51.966 --> 25:53.567
You scared him.
sharp as a tack!

25:53.568 --> 25:54.735
I want to talk to you a second.

25:54.736 --> 25:56.202
Whatever you got planned, sorry!

25:56.203 --> 25:57.870
I'm gonna bust
your bubble right now,

25:57.871 --> 25:59.839
'cause you're not
gonna get me tonight.

25:59.840 --> 26:01.908
It's not... It's not gonna
work out for you.

26:01.909 --> 26:04.510
Look, Henry, you gotta
do me a favor, okay?

26:04.511 --> 26:05.845
You gotta... You gotta
try to man up a bit.

26:05.846 --> 26:07.145
What do you mean?

26:07.146 --> 26:08.880
You know, just kind of
grow some fucking balls,

26:08.881 --> 26:10.582
act a little tougher.

26:10.583 --> 26:14.019
Yes! I need to toughen up so
that I can get more ladies,

26:14.020 --> 26:17.088
and, you know,
the-the-the pussy

26:17.089 --> 26:18.155
and stuff like that.

26:18.156 --> 26:19.557
Why do you keep
rubbing your chest?

26:19.558 --> 26:20.691
Is your shirt soft?
It is soft.

26:20.692 --> 26:23.427
Just stick close
by me tonight, okay?

26:23.428 --> 26:26.063
Watch what I do and try
to pretend to be tougher.

26:26.064 --> 26:27.698
Yes! I should get
a shirt like yours.

26:27.699 --> 26:29.899
Stop being so obsessed
with my fucking shirt!

26:29.900 --> 26:31.601
Why are you so angry?
I'm not angry!

26:31.602 --> 26:33.036
Angry. I know
when you're angry.

26:33.037 --> 26:34.270
I'm not!

26:34.271 --> 26:36.272
I know when something's
bothering you,

26:36.273 --> 26:37.606
so just out with it.

26:39.576 --> 26:42.211
Okay, okay.

26:42.212 --> 26:45.981
But I swear to God, if you
say anything to anybody,

26:45.982 --> 26:47.749
I will bite out
your fucking tongue

26:47.750 --> 26:49.284
and I will spit it
right up your asshole.

26:49.285 --> 26:52.119
Yeah, still sounds
angry though, but okay.

26:52.120 --> 26:55.022
That's just how I talk.
Okay.

26:55.023 --> 26:58.958
Okay, last week I was running to
catch this bus, right? And...

27:01.229 --> 27:02.996
I felt shit jiggle.

27:02.997 --> 27:04.997
Okay.

27:07.767 --> 27:09.035
Oh, that's it.

27:09.036 --> 27:10.604
Yeah.

27:10.605 --> 27:13.672
Oh, Paul, um, that's what
happens when you get older.

27:13.673 --> 27:14.840
I mean, stuff starts to jiggle.

27:14.841 --> 27:16.308
Henry, this is me.

27:16.309 --> 27:17.910
I never used to give a shit
about any of that stuff.

27:17.911 --> 27:19.411
I never cared how I looked.

27:19.412 --> 27:21.146
Now I'm walking around
like half a faggot all the time,

27:21.147 --> 27:23.048
worried about being out of
shape and out of breath,

27:23.049 --> 27:24.816
and I get these fucking
pains in my chest!

27:24.817 --> 27:26.317
Wait, what? What?

27:26.318 --> 27:27.252
Oh.

27:27.253 --> 27:29.053
You have pains in your chest?

27:29.054 --> 27:30.989
Yeah, it's nothing.
I just...

27:30.990 --> 27:32.957
I get this pain in the ass
pain in my chest.

27:32.958 --> 27:37.761
I swear to God,
if you fucking tell anybody.

27:41.331 --> 27:42.532
It's gas.

27:42.533 --> 27:44.334
You're fucking dead.

27:44.335 --> 27:46.936
You're gonna want to release that.
Mm-hmm.

27:46.937 --> 27:50.172
My advice, go home,
drink some ginger ale,

27:50.173 --> 27:51.374
drop a couple
of Alka-Seltzer,

27:51.375 --> 27:53.776
let nature do the rest.

27:53.777 --> 27:54.877
You boys play safe.

27:54.878 --> 27:56.779
Thank you. Sweet.

27:56.780 --> 27:58.613
You're not the stripper?

27:58.614 --> 28:01.049
Can I get my $20 back?

28:01.050 --> 28:04.152
Man! Friggin'
writer's block!

28:04.153 --> 28:06.855
Uhh!

28:06.856 --> 28:07.922
Been working on this screenplay

28:07.923 --> 28:09.857
for, like, 11 years.

28:09.858 --> 28:12.593
Stuck in this writer's
block for, like...

28:12.594 --> 28:14.495
eight years.

28:14.496 --> 28:16.163
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

28:16.164 --> 28:18.198
I'll tell you the part
I'm stuck at.

28:18.199 --> 28:22.001
The, uh, hero dog, he's a Bouvier,

28:22.002 --> 28:24.437
takes off from his
owner's house, right?

28:24.438 --> 28:26.406
And joins up with all
these neighborhood dogs

28:26.407 --> 28:27.807
to go on an adventure.

28:27.808 --> 28:29.942
So they're in this alleyway,

28:29.943 --> 28:31.476
and they find this red wine,

28:31.477 --> 28:35.013
then they go to this crazy
humping party, right?

28:35.014 --> 28:37.549
So they're all,
like, doggy-wasted

28:37.550 --> 28:39.985
and having an amazing time,

28:39.986 --> 28:41.620
and everyone thinks that Barney...

28:41.621 --> 28:43.654
Oh, that's the Bouvier.

28:43.655 --> 28:45.656
Barney the Bouvier.

28:45.657 --> 28:46.957
Everyone thinks he's, uh,

28:46.958 --> 28:48.993
just, like, the coolest
doggy dude, right?

28:48.994 --> 28:50.728
'Cause, well, he scored the booze,

28:50.729 --> 28:56.299
and, uh, he's just this,
like, good-looking beast.

28:56.300 --> 29:01.171
So Barney's checking out this
hot poodle's ass, right?

29:01.172 --> 29:03.173
When all of a sudden, bam!

29:03.174 --> 29:04.840
Someone kicks the door in!

29:04.841 --> 29:05.941
The dog catcher?

29:05.942 --> 29:08.177
What do you mean?

29:08.178 --> 29:10.045
Who came in to get the dogs?

29:10.046 --> 29:13.716
Oh, no, no.
It was Barney's owners

29:13.717 --> 29:15.484
and their little daughter.

29:15.485 --> 29:19.354
So the owners come in, and
they slap the collar on him,

29:19.355 --> 29:21.222
and they start
hauling him off, right?

29:21.223 --> 29:24.158
And then it's, like,
cue dramatic music,

29:24.159 --> 29:27.361
like "the emperor has
fallen" type stuff, right?

29:28.563 --> 29:31.598
But the kid is happier
than shit now, right?

29:31.599 --> 29:33.633
She's just draped all over Barney

29:33.634 --> 29:35.435
just hugging and kissing him.

29:35.436 --> 29:37.704
Barney's not cluing
into the kid, though.

29:37.705 --> 29:40.139
He turns to the hot poodle,

29:40.140 --> 29:42.775
and just as he's leaving, he says,

29:42.776 --> 29:44.477
"Being owned sucks."

29:46.780 --> 29:48.914
That's all I got.

29:53.552 --> 29:55.787
Gas. Wow.

29:55.788 --> 29:57.188
That's a relief, huh?

29:57.189 --> 29:58.790
Whatever.

29:58.791 --> 30:00.225
Whatever.
You're telling me

30:00.226 --> 30:02.793
you're not relieved
it's not a heart attack?

30:02.794 --> 30:05.362
It's gas, Henry.

30:05.363 --> 30:07.164
It's fucking gas.

30:07.165 --> 30:10.300
What do I look like,
a grandpa? Jesus.

30:10.301 --> 30:12.902
And I keep gettin' this heartburn.

30:12.903 --> 30:15.171
Lately, I've been tryin'
to hide this bald spot,

30:15.172 --> 30:17.507
and I got fuckin' man tits
that jiggle when I run.

30:17.508 --> 30:19.175
I mean,
I'm 30-fucking-7.

30:19.176 --> 30:21.878
I gotta say, pal, it is refreshing

30:21.879 --> 30:23.512
to see this side of you.

30:23.513 --> 30:25.313
This... sensitive side.

30:25.314 --> 30:27.749
Let's us all know
there's a big old heart

30:27.750 --> 30:29.918
beating in that
burly chest of yours.

30:29.919 --> 30:31.920
Henry, keep it down, okay?

30:31.921 --> 30:34.221
And cut that flowery shit out.

30:34.222 --> 30:35.456
It is funny.

30:35.457 --> 30:38.426
You know, here I am trying
to mend a broken heart.

30:38.427 --> 30:41.462
And you're worried
about yours breaking.

30:41.463 --> 30:43.531
Okay, we gotta toughen
you up right fucking now!

30:43.532 --> 30:45.397
Okay, yes! I'm game.

30:46.566 --> 30:47.934
Here's the plan.

30:47.935 --> 30:49.769
Okay, you see that babe with Luke?
Mm-hmm.

30:49.770 --> 30:50.870
She's the stripper.

30:50.871 --> 30:52.172
She's pretty.

30:52.173 --> 30:53.573
She's been hired
to flirt with these losers

30:53.574 --> 30:56.408
and give them boners,
so they'll buy more booze.

30:56.409 --> 30:57.676
Okay.

30:57.677 --> 30:58.944
Go hit on her.

30:58.945 --> 31:00.879
But... Wait, what?

31:00.880 --> 31:02.581
No, she's...
She's a stripper.

31:02.582 --> 31:03.949
Exactly.

31:03.950 --> 31:05.350
It'll be like learning
how to pick up chicks

31:05.351 --> 31:07.518
with training wheels.

31:07.519 --> 31:08.853
Right.

31:08.854 --> 31:10.421
Yes.

31:10.422 --> 31:13.491
So, just, uh,
hypothetically speaking,

31:13.492 --> 31:17.195
if you were to have a
wild night of adultery...

31:17.196 --> 31:19.095
Oh!
what kind of a...

31:19.096 --> 31:21.196
What kind of girl
would you be into?

31:22.165 --> 31:24.434
No, no, I...

31:24.435 --> 31:26.002
Hey!

31:26.003 --> 31:28.337
Hey! Good. Hi.

31:30.806 --> 31:33.008
Oh! Uh, sorry.
Paul, this is Candy,

31:33.009 --> 31:34.543
and this is Henry, so...

31:34.544 --> 31:35.778
Yeah.

31:35.779 --> 31:37.613
Hey, Lukey, can I talk to you?

31:37.614 --> 31:38.881
Are you okay?

31:38.882 --> 31:39.915
Yeah.
Okay.

31:39.916 --> 31:43.051
Whoops.

31:43.052 --> 31:45.954
Well, it's a pleasure
to make your acquaintance.

31:45.955 --> 31:47.956
Thanks, it's nice
to meet you, too.

31:47.957 --> 31:49.489
Ah! Well...

31:57.097 --> 32:00.633
So, do you, uh...

32:02.336 --> 32:03.802
come here often?

32:04.670 --> 32:05.738
No.
No.

32:05.739 --> 32:07.306
You?

32:07.307 --> 32:08.808
No.

32:08.809 --> 32:11.811
No, me, either.

32:11.812 --> 32:13.646
So we got that in common.

32:13.647 --> 32:15.280
You're the oldest guy
in the group, right?

32:15.281 --> 32:17.482
By, like, a month.
Well, still.

32:17.483 --> 32:21.253
You ever, uh...

32:21.254 --> 32:22.754
You ever think about dying?

32:22.755 --> 32:24.489
Oh, yeah, sure.

32:24.490 --> 32:26.590
Really?
Yeah.

32:26.591 --> 32:28.392
Totally. Yeah.

32:28.393 --> 32:30.127
Especially, like,
ever since Isabelle was born.

32:30.128 --> 32:32.329
Yeah, now we got
another one on the way.

32:32.330 --> 32:33.797
Think about if anything
happened to me,

32:33.798 --> 32:35.065
you know, who would
take care of them?

32:35.066 --> 32:36.900
So you think it's...
it's normal.

32:36.901 --> 32:38.601
It's a normal thing
to think about?

32:38.602 --> 32:40.970
So, uh, how long
have you been in the arts?

32:40.971 --> 32:44.639
Just so you know, private
dances are 60 bucks.

32:45.842 --> 32:47.843
Yeah.
Wow!

32:47.844 --> 32:49.311
Okay.

32:49.312 --> 32:52.281
That's cool.
I mean... cool to me.

32:52.282 --> 32:54.116
Does that include a drink?

32:56.753 --> 32:58.320
You're joking, right?

32:58.321 --> 32:59.453
No, it's part of a prank
we're playing on the groom.

32:59.454 --> 33:00.655
Yeah, I don't think so.

33:00.656 --> 33:02.123
I can pay you for it!

33:02.124 --> 33:04.058
Isn't that something the
stripper should be doing?

33:04.059 --> 33:05.993
Uh, I already asked her
and she passed.

33:05.994 --> 33:08.195
Yeah. Sorry, it's
not my kinda thing.

33:08.196 --> 33:09.763
What's not your thing?

33:09.764 --> 33:11.298
Oh, hey, Ken!
It's not her... She's just...

33:11.299 --> 33:13.732
It was just a very
complicated drink order.

33:20.173 --> 33:22.840
Thank you, Pam.
That will be all for now.

33:24.209 --> 33:25.945
Sometimes I have
trouble grabbing things.

33:25.946 --> 33:27.279
Right.

33:27.280 --> 33:28.948
Still having some
depth perception issues.

33:28.949 --> 33:30.716
Okay, guys, let's play some cards.

33:30.717 --> 33:32.116
Yeah, let's do this!

33:32.117 --> 33:33.885
I think you know most
of the people here.

33:33.886 --> 33:36.120
Not sure if you remember Randy.

33:36.121 --> 33:37.956
No, I don't.
Hey, how you, uh...

33:37.957 --> 33:39.657
Yeah, you actually came to my stag

33:39.658 --> 33:41.092
with a buddy of mine
a couple of years ago.

33:41.093 --> 33:43.260
Oh, cool.

33:43.261 --> 33:45.195
No, not really.
You guys got me drunk

33:45.196 --> 33:47.197
till I passed out,
and then you superglued

33:47.198 --> 33:48.265
some of my fingers together

33:48.266 --> 33:49.466
so all I could do was this.

33:49.467 --> 33:52.169
Live long and prosper.

33:52.170 --> 33:53.870
Yeah.

33:53.871 --> 33:55.171
That must have hurt.

33:55.172 --> 33:56.372
More than you know.

33:56.373 --> 33:58.941
My fiancÃ©e realized
I couldn't slip

33:58.942 --> 34:00.076
a wedding ring on my finger,

34:00.077 --> 34:01.344
so she postponed the wedding.

34:01.345 --> 34:02.945
Oh.

34:02.946 --> 34:04.580
I... I, uh...
I had no idea.

34:04.581 --> 34:06.681
Then before we even
got to the altar,

34:06.682 --> 34:08.315
she decided to sleep
with my best friend,

34:08.317 --> 34:10.918
so the wedding was called off.

34:13.154 --> 34:14.822
You know, I remember at my stag...

34:14.824 --> 34:17.757
I was so enraged that I
confronted my ex-best friend,

34:17.759 --> 34:20.728
and in a fury, beat
the crap out of him.

34:20.728 --> 34:22.161
Wow.

34:22.163 --> 34:23.764
I was arrested for assault

34:23.764 --> 34:25.466
and spent 6 months in prison.

34:25.467 --> 34:27.034
It was during that time in jail

34:27.034 --> 34:28.534
that my fingers
finally came unstuck.

34:28.534 --> 34:29.569
Oh.

34:29.570 --> 34:31.938
At least your fingers
are normal again.

34:31.938 --> 34:34.741
Unfortunately, too late
for me to defend myself

34:34.742 --> 34:35.942
against the nightly beatings

34:35.943 --> 34:38.043
I took from gang members.

34:38.909 --> 34:40.744
Bummer.

34:41.947 --> 34:44.683
Randy, I did
a terrible thing to you,

34:44.684 --> 34:46.118
and for that, I'm sorry.

34:46.119 --> 34:48.853
But you have to understand, I
had no idea

34:48.855 --> 34:50.621
what the ramifications would be.

34:50.621 --> 34:53.224
I can only assume you're
here to fuck me up, right?

34:53.225 --> 34:57.393
Hmm. The thought actually
never crossed my mind.

34:57.995 --> 34:59.964
Seriously?
Really?

34:59.965 --> 35:01.297
Why are you here then?

35:01.298 --> 35:05.235
Dude, it's a stag.

35:05.236 --> 35:07.303
Just here to play some cards,

35:07.304 --> 35:09.738
have some beer, and relax.

35:12.808 --> 35:15.309
Great.

35:19.148 --> 35:20.516
I think.

35:20.517 --> 35:22.017
All right, lads, anti in!

35:22.018 --> 35:23.384
<i>Here we go</i>

35:23.385 --> 35:24.852
How the fuck do you fail

35:24.853 --> 35:26.254
at hitting on a stripper?

35:26.255 --> 35:27.522
Are you out of breath?

35:27.523 --> 35:29.991
Shut the fuck up
and answer the question.

35:29.992 --> 35:32.126
I didn't fail.
She's quite nice.

35:32.127 --> 35:34.361
Very good listener.
I think I made a friend.

35:34.362 --> 35:36.096
A friend? She's
a fucking stripper, Henry.

35:36.097 --> 35:37.497
You don't need a friend.

35:37.498 --> 35:39.366
You got a whole basement
full of friends over there.

35:39.367 --> 35:41.368
What you need is someone to bang!

35:41.369 --> 35:43.236
What you need is to reach down

35:43.237 --> 35:45.272
and locate your testosterone

35:45.273 --> 35:46.605
and yank it the fuck up

35:46.606 --> 35:49.241
so that people might
actually see that it exists!

35:49.242 --> 35:51.510
You're right.

35:51.511 --> 35:53.813
Something's gotta change,
and it's gotta change now.

35:53.814 --> 35:54.814
Yeah.

35:54.815 --> 35:56.648
You know, I'm sick

35:56.649 --> 35:58.650
of the ladies loving me
like a brother!

35:58.651 --> 36:00.919
Yeah!
And if I can't score the snatch,

36:00.920 --> 36:04.022
then I'm gonna enter the world
of manly men another way!

36:04.023 --> 36:05.890
That's it!
That's my boy!

36:05.891 --> 36:07.092
Ugh!

36:07.093 --> 36:08.559
It's time to kick some ass!

36:08.560 --> 36:11.228
No. No, it's not.
No, it's not.

36:11.229 --> 36:12.763
Paul? Outta my way,

36:12.764 --> 36:15.865
or your head's gonna be
the first ass I kick.

36:18.168 --> 36:20.303
Okay.
Here.

36:20.304 --> 36:21.571
Okay, go ahead.

36:21.572 --> 36:22.572
Hold these,

36:22.573 --> 36:26.142
'cause this might get ugly.

36:26.143 --> 36:27.709
Definitely.

36:49.096 --> 36:50.663
What'd you say to me?

36:51.999 --> 36:53.532
Huh?

36:55.702 --> 36:56.503
Me?

36:56.504 --> 36:59.572
Yeah, you, troublemaker.

36:59.573 --> 37:02.776
You lookin' for some trouble?

37:02.777 --> 37:04.943
I don't think so.

37:07.347 --> 37:08.714
On your feet, old man.

37:08.715 --> 37:11.150
It's time someone
taught you a lesson,

37:11.151 --> 37:12.718
you pathetic hobo.

37:12.719 --> 37:15.953
Who you callin' old?

37:15.954 --> 37:18.556
Ha ha! That's... ugh.

37:18.557 --> 37:19.957
God.

37:19.958 --> 37:23.194
I must warn you, I am twice
your size and half your age,

37:23.195 --> 37:26.662
and though these fists have never
touched the flesh of another man...

37:27.998 --> 37:29.666
Mmm!

37:29.667 --> 37:30.567
Rude!

37:30.568 --> 37:32.536
I was in the middle of talking!

37:32.537 --> 37:33.869
Aw!

37:35.605 --> 37:36.906
Aah!

37:36.907 --> 37:37.973
Hah!

37:37.974 --> 37:39.275
Aah!
Burn!

37:39.276 --> 37:41.243
Aah! Ha ha ha!

37:41.244 --> 37:44.213
Come on!
Let's go, bitch!

37:44.214 --> 37:46.315
Jesus. It's like giving
spinach to Popeye.

37:46.316 --> 37:47.817
So how long were you dating?

37:49.952 --> 37:52.287
About eight months.

37:52.288 --> 37:53.822
That's not that long.

37:53.823 --> 37:55.290
Well, it was for me.

37:55.291 --> 37:59.059
Although, I wouldn't
exactly call it dating.

38:00.428 --> 38:02.229
How do you mean?

38:02.230 --> 38:04.631
Well, I mean, we never really
went out and did anything.

38:04.632 --> 38:06.366
It was pretty much,
you know, just the things

38:06.367 --> 38:10.003
that the publicist would arrange.

38:10.004 --> 38:11.971
I don't understand.

38:11.972 --> 38:15.575
Oh. It happens all the time.
It's like a thing.

38:15.576 --> 38:17.443
You know, the studio
pays the publicist

38:17.444 --> 38:20.179
to get two celebrities
to go out together,

38:20.180 --> 38:21.513
and then they tell

38:21.514 --> 38:22.781
the paparazzi where you're going.

38:22.782 --> 38:25.383
By the end of the night,
I have flashbulbs

38:25.384 --> 38:26.785
popping off in my face,

38:26.786 --> 38:30.021
and the studio has people
talking about their movie.

38:30.022 --> 38:32.023
Hang on a sec.

38:32.024 --> 38:35.559
Let me put this in terms
that I'll understand.

38:35.560 --> 38:40.331
So a really rich guy...
let's call him John...

38:40.332 --> 38:45.435
pays another guy...
let's call him pimp...

38:45.436 --> 38:48.571
to take out a hot girl
for a night.

38:48.572 --> 38:51.007
Let's call her...
Careful!

38:51.008 --> 38:53.443
Let's call her you.

38:53.444 --> 38:56.178
And in the end, guys are
popping off in her face?

38:56.179 --> 38:58.513
Ew! That's sick!

38:58.514 --> 38:59.715
I've just about got it.

38:59.716 --> 39:01.350
Just hang on, sweetheart.

39:01.351 --> 39:02.618
We'll have you out
of there in a minute.

39:02.619 --> 39:04.019
Just about there.

39:04.020 --> 39:05.619
Oh, crap.

39:07.088 --> 39:09.323
Now or never, Carl, now or never.

39:09.324 --> 39:11.259
Hey, can I talk to you for a second?
Hmm?

39:11.260 --> 39:14.829
Listen, I know you're, like,
this huge Hollywood megastar,

39:14.830 --> 39:18.999
<i>who was so good
in Tiger Baiby the way.</i>

39:19.000 --> 39:22.969
And I'm at a point where I'm
questioning my career choices,

39:22.970 --> 39:25.939
if not my life choices.

39:25.940 --> 39:27.474
Okay, I'm rambling.

39:27.475 --> 39:29.708
I was wondering if you...
Look, uh, Clark...

39:29.709 --> 39:30.843
It's Carl.

39:30.844 --> 39:32.845
You seem like
a really sweet guy. I...

39:32.846 --> 39:34.513
Just let me finish.

39:34.514 --> 39:36.649
It's just that I'm single,

39:36.650 --> 39:39.884
and I know that you are, too,

39:39.885 --> 39:44.489
and, uh, in a weird way,
we've already been

39:44.490 --> 39:47.525
shacked up together
for a few hours, right?

39:47.526 --> 39:50.394
Well, that's true.
I guess we survived.

39:50.395 --> 39:53.196
Yes. We totally survived.

39:53.197 --> 39:57.801
So maybe this is all meant to be.

39:57.802 --> 40:01.305
Maybe we could be...
meant to be.

40:02.472 --> 40:03.739
Maybe when I
get out of the hospital...

40:03.740 --> 40:06.208
- Hospital?
- Got it!

40:06.209 --> 40:08.010
Okay, I'm out of time.

40:08.011 --> 40:09.711
Will you go out with me?

40:17.619 --> 40:19.920
I'm sorry. I can't.

40:22.490 --> 40:23.958
All right, here's a story
for you guys.

40:23.959 --> 40:26.527
These pictures you're taking
will be the last ones

40:26.528 --> 40:28.429
taken of Clark alive.

40:28.430 --> 40:30.163
It's Carl.

40:46.745 --> 40:49.481
Take me to the basement.

40:49.482 --> 40:51.450
I know this might
seem sort of strange,

40:51.451 --> 40:54.820
but I actually
don't have long to live,

40:54.821 --> 40:57.655
and I've never been kissed...

40:57.656 --> 40:58.856
ever.

40:58.857 --> 41:02.058
Would it be too much
to ask you to kiss me?

41:13.870 --> 41:17.007
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

41:21.277 --> 41:22.878
You owe me a fucking shirt!

41:22.879 --> 41:25.914
Whoo! Oh, my God!

41:25.915 --> 41:28.183
That was awesome!

41:29.486 --> 41:31.185
Weirdest fucking thing I ever saw.

41:31.186 --> 41:34.222
I... I feel so alive,
like I could do anything!

41:34.223 --> 41:36.157
Know what? Me, too.

41:36.158 --> 41:37.692
Look at this.
Look at this.

41:37.693 --> 41:38.926
Pure adrenaline, right?

41:38.927 --> 41:40.161
Fucking right.

41:40.162 --> 41:42.262
Uhh! Ha ha!

41:42.263 --> 41:45.331
I now know I love fighting!

41:46.767 --> 41:48.902
Technically, Henry, I don't
think that was fighting.

41:51.305 --> 41:53.539
Look here. Look at that.

41:53.540 --> 41:55.341
Blood, huh?

41:55.342 --> 41:56.909
It's barbeque sauce, Henry.

41:56.910 --> 42:00.012
The fucking old man threw a
fucking chicken wing at you.

42:00.013 --> 42:01.313
But I took it!

42:01.314 --> 42:02.515
I fucking took it!

42:02.516 --> 42:04.115
And listen to my language!

42:04.116 --> 42:06.918
I'm swearing like a fucking
sailor, for fuck's sake!

42:06.919 --> 42:07.919
Oh!

42:07.920 --> 42:10.688
Ahh!

42:10.689 --> 42:13.158
Not sure I'm buying it, Henry.

42:13.159 --> 42:14.559
What are you talking about?

42:14.560 --> 42:17.460
It's just not you.

42:20.597 --> 42:23.534
You know what, Paul?

42:23.535 --> 42:25.035
Fuck you.

42:25.036 --> 42:26.469
Excuse me?

42:26.470 --> 42:28.204
No, you heard me.

42:28.205 --> 42:30.438
Fuck you, Paul.

42:32.008 --> 42:33.976
Who died and made you
king of the cool guys?

42:33.977 --> 42:36.079
I'm not the king
of anything, Henry.

42:36.080 --> 42:37.312
I'm sick of it.

42:37.313 --> 42:40.582
Seriously, you just walk around,

42:40.583 --> 42:42.517
because you're so cool,

42:42.518 --> 42:43.785
and nothing ever bothers you.

42:43.786 --> 42:45.554
How do I walk around?

42:45.555 --> 42:47.055
"Oh, what if I have
a heart attack? Mm, uh.

42:47.056 --> 42:48.322
Oh, what if I die?"

42:48.323 --> 42:51.559
Well, what about you,
eh, Mr... Mr. Sweet Guy?

42:51.560 --> 42:53.727
Mr. Understanding,
Mr. Compassionate,

42:53.728 --> 42:55.463
giving his fucking heart
away all the time

42:55.464 --> 42:57.331
and getting it broken and
then come crying to me?

42:57.332 --> 43:00.166
You're always there for your
best friend in your tight jeans,

43:00.167 --> 43:02.602
thinking everyone's
checking out your ass.

43:02.603 --> 43:03.770
Well, what do you want me to do?

43:03.771 --> 43:05.071
You want me to be all tucked in

43:05.072 --> 43:06.473
and presentable
and perfect like you?

43:06.474 --> 43:08.174
Maybe Luke was right about you.

43:08.175 --> 43:10.310
What?

43:10.311 --> 43:12.878
What does Luke say about me?

43:12.879 --> 43:14.580
Nothing.

43:14.581 --> 43:16.748
No, what...
What did Luke say, Paul?

43:16.749 --> 43:18.784
Didn't say nothin'.

43:18.785 --> 43:20.051
Paul.

43:22.753 --> 43:25.756
Luke was just sayin',

43:25.757 --> 43:30.394
you know, sometimes
him and some of the guys

43:30.395 --> 43:33.530
think that maybe.
you might be...

43:33.531 --> 43:35.799
What the fuck is
the matter with you?

43:35.800 --> 43:37.467
What the fuck is
the matter with you?!

43:37.468 --> 43:40.035
Huh? You... You can't...

43:41.905 --> 43:43.173
Oh.

43:53.950 --> 43:57.318
You know, it's a good thing
nobody was thinking about

43:57.319 --> 44:00.622
shaving my eyebrows off
or something like that,

44:00.623 --> 44:02.891
'cause that'd be fucked up.

44:02.892 --> 44:06.094
You like the jeans?
Mmm!

44:06.095 --> 44:10.197
Really easy to get off.
Really easy.

44:11.900 --> 44:13.567
I'd look weird.

44:13.568 --> 44:15.335
All of this, none of this.

44:15.336 --> 44:16.570
So if I'm drunk and passed out

44:16.571 --> 44:19.639
at the end of the night,
you know...

44:19.640 --> 44:21.741
You put me in a gorilla suit

44:21.742 --> 44:26.846
and drop me off at my office
drunk and passed out.

44:26.847 --> 44:30.482
Me with no eyebrows?
Come on.

44:30.483 --> 44:32.483
I have a gorilla suit.

44:34.186 --> 44:35.453
Okay, continue.

44:35.454 --> 44:37.821
Look, it's all
I could find, all right?

44:39.024 --> 44:41.325
It's called maca or something.

44:41.326 --> 44:43.661
The guy at the market said
it nourishes hormonal glands

44:43.662 --> 44:45.462
and helps men
with natural production

44:45.463 --> 44:47.364
of testosterone hormones
for energy,

44:47.365 --> 44:48.465
libido, and sexual enhancement.

44:48.466 --> 44:49.733
That's so complicated.

44:49.734 --> 44:51.868
I just want to give Ken a boner.

44:51.869 --> 44:53.736
Boys.
Good night, huh?

44:53.737 --> 44:55.371
It's the way it should be.

44:55.372 --> 44:57.140
No wife, no kids, just
hanging out with the guys.

44:57.141 --> 44:58.508
We need to get Ken to eat this.

44:58.509 --> 45:00.043
What is that?

45:00.044 --> 45:01.544
No time for questions!
Just get the waitress chick

45:01.545 --> 45:02.911
to chop it into his nachos

45:02.912 --> 45:04.313
or boil it into his drink
or something.

45:04.314 --> 45:06.181
Oh, okay, so you planned
it out real well. Good.

45:06.182 --> 45:07.282
Look, there she is.

45:07.283 --> 45:08.850
She's talking
to your stripper friend.

45:08.851 --> 45:10.052
No, hey, she's not my friend.

45:10.053 --> 45:11.553
Okay? I just
picked her up.

45:11.554 --> 45:12.788
I don't know about that.

45:12.789 --> 45:13.955
You guys have been
kind of chummy lately.

45:13.956 --> 45:15.256
I think she's diggin' you.

45:15.257 --> 45:16.290
No. Yeah?

45:16.291 --> 45:17.258
No! No!

45:17.259 --> 45:19.426
Oh, my God, no one cares.
Just go.

45:20.995 --> 45:21.796
Luke.

45:21.797 --> 45:22.897
Hey, Mark.

45:29.369 --> 45:30.870
Hey, ladies.
Hey.

45:30.871 --> 45:31.838
Hey.

45:31.839 --> 45:33.840
Hey, Uncle Luke,
we were just talking

45:33.841 --> 45:34.941
about how you know each other.

45:34.942 --> 45:36.675
We don't know each other.

45:36.676 --> 45:38.143
I mean, you know.

45:38.144 --> 45:40.980
Uh... like how does
anyone know anyone?

45:40.981 --> 45:43.249
That kind of thing,
you know what I mean?

45:43.250 --> 45:44.850
I know I need a drink.

45:44.851 --> 45:47.185
Yeah. Cranberry juice
would be good.

45:47.186 --> 45:50.388
'Cause I'm driving, so time to
switch.

45:50.389 --> 45:52.390
I'm very responsible, okay?

45:52.391 --> 45:53.391
Responsible and moral.

45:53.392 --> 45:54.792
Yeah.

45:54.793 --> 45:57.128
Can you also chop that up,
put it in a drink,

45:57.129 --> 45:59.196
and, uh, serve it to that guy?

45:59.197 --> 46:00.697
I don't know
I could get in trouble.

46:00.698 --> 46:02.633
Don't do it then.
I don't care.

46:02.634 --> 46:04.001
Cranberry.

46:04.002 --> 46:07.170
Uh, what...
Was that maca?

46:07.171 --> 46:08.704
I don't know.

46:08.705 --> 46:11.140
No idea.

46:12.643 --> 46:14.944
Well, I should, uh, probably go

46:14.945 --> 46:17.847
and slip into this outfit.

46:17.848 --> 46:21.182
Unless, um, of course, you
wanted to help me with it.

46:22.518 --> 46:24.219
Uh...

46:24.220 --> 46:25.253
I can't. Come on.

46:25.254 --> 46:26.888
I mean, you can do it on your own.

46:26.889 --> 46:29.557
I don't think I...
Hey, uh, you got a second?

46:29.558 --> 46:30.659
Yes, I do.

46:30.660 --> 46:31.925
Yeah, for sure.
What's up?

46:31.926 --> 46:33.160
I need to talk
to you in the bathroom.

46:33.161 --> 46:36.096
Perfect, even better.
Okay. See ya.

46:36.097 --> 46:37.398
Wow.

46:38.667 --> 46:39.767
Love that guy.

46:39.768 --> 46:41.234
Please.

46:43.903 --> 46:45.605
What's goin' on, guys?

46:45.606 --> 46:46.873
Did you do it?

46:46.874 --> 46:48.241
She gonna put
the thing in his thing?

46:48.242 --> 46:50.543
I begged her, but I
don't know if she will.

46:50.544 --> 46:52.412
What the fuck, Luke? There's
no margin for error here!

46:52.413 --> 46:53.779
Ta-ta-ta-ta-ta...

46:53.780 --> 46:55.647
I want to thank you all
for coming out tonight.

46:55.648 --> 46:57.382
I really appreciate it,

46:57.383 --> 46:59.518
uh, but the purpose
of a stag is...

46:59.519 --> 47:00.786
Ooh! Ooh!

47:00.787 --> 47:02.521
Shut the fuck up, Henry!

47:02.522 --> 47:03.922
I'm going!

47:03.923 --> 47:05.523
You're the dickhead
who got us kicked out

47:05.524 --> 47:06.590
in the first place!

47:08.527 --> 47:10.361
This is exciting!

47:10.362 --> 47:12.063
I feel like Spider-man!

47:12.064 --> 47:13.731
Yes!
Or Tom Cruise!

47:13.732 --> 47:14.899
Okay, careful, careful.

47:14.900 --> 47:16.666
I gotcha. I gotcha.
I gotcha.

47:16.667 --> 47:18.627
Watch your back, watch
your back, watch your back!

47:19.537 --> 47:20.704
Step, step!

47:20.705 --> 47:22.305
Okay, okay, okay.

47:24.175 --> 47:25.408
Oh, fuck!

47:25.409 --> 47:26.809
That close.

47:26.810 --> 47:28.711
Hey! What's with
the fucking sausage party

47:28.712 --> 47:29.945
in the bathroom?

47:29.946 --> 47:31.347
Yeah, where's
that stripper action?

47:31.348 --> 47:32.815
Let's get this
fucking party started, eh?

47:32.816 --> 47:34.817
Yeah, and play
some poker and football.

47:34.818 --> 47:36.385
Who wants to arm wrestle me!

47:36.386 --> 47:37.486
Yeah, yeah!
Huh?

47:37.487 --> 47:38.920
Really, where's that stripper?

47:38.921 --> 47:40.822
Huh? Let's see some
fucking pussy, fellas!

47:40.823 --> 47:42.056
Indeed! Let's see

47:42.057 --> 47:43.925
some fucking fellas, pussy!
What?

47:43.926 --> 47:46.027
- What?
- You said, "Let's see some fellas."

47:46.028 --> 47:47.695
No.
Yes, you did.

47:47.696 --> 47:49.663
Really? That's...

47:49.664 --> 47:51.264
That's the last thing we need.

47:51.265 --> 47:52.499
Yeah!

47:52.500 --> 47:55.168
'Cause nobody here
is into dudes, right?

47:55.169 --> 47:57.671
Not us!
That'd be funny!

47:59.741 --> 48:01.841
All right, shut
the fuck up and listen!

48:01.842 --> 48:04.477
For 10 years,

48:04.478 --> 48:07.813
we've seen a bunch
of our friends get married

48:07.814 --> 48:10.116
and say good-bye
to their freedom.

48:10.117 --> 48:11.082
Right?

48:11.083 --> 48:13.017
And all of them have had a stag.

48:13.018 --> 48:14.552
A great stag.

48:14.553 --> 48:17.622
And part of the reason
why the stag was so awesome

48:17.623 --> 48:20.925
was because I came up
with some clever-slash-fun prank

48:20.926 --> 48:23.060
to pull on
the groom-to-be. True?

48:23.061 --> 48:24.628
Yeah, it's true.
Correct.

48:24.629 --> 48:25.629
You're the King, Kenny!

48:25.630 --> 48:26.864
Gotta concede that.

48:26.865 --> 48:30.234
Now it's my turn, okay?

48:30.235 --> 48:33.770
It's my turn to say
good-bye to my freedom

48:33.771 --> 48:35.805
and life as I know it.

48:35.806 --> 48:38.141
And I've been freaking out

48:38.142 --> 48:39.942
pretty much all day long

48:39.943 --> 48:43.079
wondering what you guys were
gonna do to kick my ass.

48:43.080 --> 48:44.646
And the guy that I had counted on

48:44.647 --> 48:47.949
to show up and watch my back?

48:47.950 --> 48:49.650
He didn't show.

48:50.886 --> 48:53.355
And now I have
the distinct impression

48:53.356 --> 48:57.123
that you guys have
nothing planned for me.

48:59.160 --> 49:00.027
Nothing.

49:00.028 --> 49:03.030
Not so fast, asshole!

49:03.031 --> 49:05.665
I actually do have
some payback planned.

49:06.600 --> 49:07.767
I think.

49:07.768 --> 49:11.004
Or I did have some...
I did have some.

49:11.005 --> 49:13.807
Yeah, yeah, we did,
but you know what?

49:13.808 --> 49:15.575
Ran into a snag or two.
Wasn't me.

49:15.576 --> 49:16.876
Why?

49:16.877 --> 49:18.811
Well, I mean, you know,
not the easiest thing.

49:18.812 --> 49:20.212
I mean, you know,
there's, you know,

49:20.213 --> 49:22.347
a couple problems,
different stages to the...

49:22.348 --> 49:25.951
Some things just kinda
got in the way.

49:25.952 --> 49:27.719
It actually seemed kind of mean.

49:27.720 --> 49:29.520
It's supposed to be mean!

49:29.521 --> 49:31.322
What was the plan?

49:31.323 --> 49:32.690
Oh, it was gonna be amazing.

49:32.691 --> 49:34.058
Okay, so first we were
gonna get you drunk,

49:34.059 --> 49:35.693
and then when you passed out...

49:35.694 --> 49:37.929
Okay, I know how it starts.
Let's get to how it ends.

49:37.930 --> 49:41.431
Well, then we were gonna
take your pants off.

49:41.432 --> 49:43.834
And give you a boner!

49:43.835 --> 49:45.769
I wasn't gonna give you the boner.

49:45.770 --> 49:47.771
No, no, no, no, no!
I didn't think...

49:47.772 --> 49:49.439
Stripper would give you the boner.

49:49.440 --> 49:50.540
I hate boners.

49:50.541 --> 49:51.807
Well, wait a minute.

49:51.808 --> 49:53.042
I thought we were gonna
give him Viagra.

49:53.043 --> 49:54.176
I couldn't get Viagra.

49:54.177 --> 49:55.511
My mom keeps it locked up.

49:55.512 --> 49:56.779
Your mom has Viagra?

49:56.780 --> 49:57.813
Your mom has a penis?

49:57.814 --> 49:59.081
No! Pfft!

49:59.082 --> 50:00.683
My mom's boyfriend has a penis.

50:00.684 --> 50:01.917
Your mom has a boyfriend?

50:01.918 --> 50:03.952
Guys can we please fucking focus?

50:03.953 --> 50:05.820
Okay, so once you had a boner,

50:05.821 --> 50:08.022
we were gonna get the stripper
to write on it in indelible ink,

50:08.023 --> 50:10.492
"Candy was here."

50:10.493 --> 50:12.494
And then when, you know,
it was all small and soft,

50:12.495 --> 50:14.528
it would just look
like a little smudge.

50:14.529 --> 50:15.596
Or a freckle.

50:15.597 --> 50:17.030
And then when you and Caroline

50:17.031 --> 50:19.766
started to, you know, fool around.

50:19.767 --> 50:21.268
Right?

50:21.269 --> 50:24.371
Yeah, so then when it was
all big and engorged,

50:24.372 --> 50:26.572
then she'd be able
to just clearly read it.

50:26.573 --> 50:28.574
Yeah, I get it.

50:28.575 --> 50:29.942
Guys, that's not half bad.

50:29.943 --> 50:31.177
Why aren't we doing this?

50:31.178 --> 50:33.713
Uh, who says we're not?

50:33.714 --> 50:35.348
Well, no boner pills.

50:35.349 --> 50:37.916
And also Candy said
she wouldn't do it.

50:37.917 --> 50:39.084
I talked to her.

50:39.085 --> 50:42.554
Guys, wait!
Stop!

50:42.555 --> 50:44.089
We can't do it.

50:44.090 --> 50:46.024
Can't. 'Cause...

50:46.025 --> 50:49.827
I Googled the effects of
indelible ink on the penis,

50:49.828 --> 50:51.328
and it is not pretty.

50:51.329 --> 50:53.731
Carl, you can relax.
We're not doing it.

50:53.732 --> 50:57.101
Okay. I just ran
12 blocks.

50:57.102 --> 50:59.235
Eh, it's probably for the best.

50:59.236 --> 51:01.638
I mean, that Caroline,
she is a sweet lady,

51:01.639 --> 51:03.373
and she'd get pretty upset.

51:03.374 --> 51:06.442
Yeah, and, you know, we'd
have to get you drunk,

51:06.443 --> 51:08.811
and that usually costs
a lot of money,

51:08.812 --> 51:10.412
and I'm kinda tight
these days, Ken.

51:10.413 --> 51:12.180
You know what?
I mean, it wouldn't happen

51:12.181 --> 51:14.616
till later on tonight,
and I've had a long day.

51:14.617 --> 51:16.218
I've gotta get going soon.

51:16.219 --> 51:19.254
No, I get it guys.
Don't even worry about it.

51:19.255 --> 51:22.189
I mean, if you're too busy
to disrespect me the way

51:22.190 --> 51:24.992
I've disrespected you
in the past, that's fine.

51:24.993 --> 51:27.895
I'll just, uh...

51:27.896 --> 51:29.196
say good-bye
to my independence

51:29.197 --> 51:32.832
over a couple of uneventful beers

51:32.833 --> 51:35.168
and a boring cab ride home.

51:35.169 --> 51:38.572
Okay.
So we're cool then?

51:38.573 --> 51:39.872
Thanks, man.

51:41.408 --> 51:44.944
It's ain't over until
it's over, Ken!

51:44.945 --> 51:48.080
It ain't over until...
Okay, guys wait up.

51:50.917 --> 51:52.817
Paul, wait up.

51:54.919 --> 51:56.688
Hey, can I see you in the
bathroom for a second?

51:56.689 --> 51:58.388
I... Oh, come on.

52:05.463 --> 52:06.597
Okay.

52:06.598 --> 52:08.265
I'm gonna be honest.
I am not comfortable

52:08.266 --> 52:10.367
helping you or watching
you get changed, so...

52:10.368 --> 52:11.935
You know, I've been
watching you all night, Luke.

52:11.936 --> 52:14.137
Uh, I-I-I am a...

52:14.138 --> 52:15.572
I'm a married happily man, so...

52:15.573 --> 52:16.672
I mean, I'm a...

52:16.673 --> 52:17.907
I'm a married happily man.

52:17.908 --> 52:20.409
And yet you're in the ladies room

52:20.410 --> 52:25.047
with a stripper
who's about to get undressed.

52:25.048 --> 52:27.148
That's why I'm leaving.

52:27.149 --> 52:30.251
Oh, so you don't
find me attractive?

52:30.252 --> 52:33.321
No. What?
Yeah, yeah, I just...

52:33.322 --> 52:35.190
Why are you here?
In the bathroom?

52:35.191 --> 52:37.258
No, the stag.

52:37.259 --> 52:39.193
Why am I at the stag?
Yeah.

52:39.194 --> 52:40.394
'Cause it's a stag!

52:40.395 --> 52:41.962
Hang out with the boys, right?

52:41.963 --> 52:43.097
Get rid of stress from the job,

52:43.098 --> 52:44.698
the stupid fucking job.

52:44.699 --> 52:46.166
The toilet job?

52:46.167 --> 52:47.868
Yes, the toilet job, yeah,

52:47.869 --> 52:49.969
where every day, I deal with
rejection after rejection,

52:49.970 --> 52:53.272
and then I go home to a stack
of bills and a messy house

52:53.273 --> 52:55.141
and a kid who...
who I love.

52:55.142 --> 52:56.943
I love her. Love
my daughter so much.

52:56.944 --> 52:58.811
She's my princess, but she
doesn't shut the fuck up!

52:58.812 --> 53:01.213
And now we got
another one on the way?

53:01.214 --> 53:03.015
You know, all I want
once in a while

53:03.016 --> 53:05.984
is a little intimacy
with my wife. That's it.

53:05.985 --> 53:07.119
But she's not in the mood.

53:07.120 --> 53:08.320
She's never in the mood!

53:08.321 --> 53:09.421
So I go down to the TV room,

53:09.422 --> 53:11.123
and I zone out till I fall asleep,

53:11.124 --> 53:12.757
and then I wake up,

53:12.758 --> 53:15.059
and I do the whole fucking
thing all over again.

53:15.060 --> 53:17.061
That's why I'm at the stag.

53:17.062 --> 53:20.765
And you thought
committing adultery would...

53:20.766 --> 53:22.133
What?
make that better?

53:22.134 --> 53:24.234
No. I would never
cheat on my wife, okay?

53:24.235 --> 53:25.602
I never have, I never will.

53:25.603 --> 53:28.204
Well, then why the offer
to help me get changed?

53:28.205 --> 53:29.973
You asked me to come in.

53:29.974 --> 53:31.508
Ugh! Jesus, Luke,
you know what?

53:31.509 --> 53:33.576
You are really
screwing things up here!

53:33.577 --> 53:34.576
What?

53:34.577 --> 53:35.477
Yeah. Okay, look,

53:35.478 --> 53:36.912
I have a confession to make.

53:36.913 --> 53:38.147
Please.

53:38.148 --> 53:40.416
I'm not just a stripper.

53:40.417 --> 53:42.418
Oh, my God, you're a hooker!

53:42.419 --> 53:44.553
A hooker?

53:44.554 --> 53:47.188
Do I look like
a hooker to you, Luke?

53:47.189 --> 53:48.523
You...

53:48.524 --> 53:50.258
I don't know how to answer that.

53:50.259 --> 53:51.626
I'm a blogger, Luke, okay?

53:51.627 --> 53:52.960
I write a blog.

53:52.961 --> 53:56.897
You've been writing
about us on the internet?

53:56.898 --> 53:58.131
My "Manopause" followers

53:58.132 --> 53:59.466
are gonna have
a tough time with you.

53:59.467 --> 54:01.301
Okay,
what is "Manopause?"

54:01.302 --> 54:04.705
Manopause... it's a term I
use for male menopause.

54:04.706 --> 54:07.140
Guys like you that are
going through a midlife crisis.

54:07.141 --> 54:09.675
Guys like me?
You don't even know me.

54:09.676 --> 54:11.410
I'm not going through
a midlife crisis.

54:11.411 --> 54:14.413
Well, you're
a middle-aged man

54:14.414 --> 54:17.216
who may very well be one of the
oldest guys at this party...

54:17.217 --> 54:18.783
What?

54:18.784 --> 54:20.685
and you've got a wife
at home that you love so much

54:20.686 --> 54:22.387
you're willing
to give up any career dreams

54:22.388 --> 54:24.456
that you may have
in order to provide her

54:24.457 --> 54:26.558
with some sense of security.

54:26.559 --> 54:29.526
And despite the fact that
you are riddled with guilt,

54:29.527 --> 54:31.762
you lied to her so
you could abandon the weight

54:31.763 --> 54:34.031
of your responsibilities
and spend a few hours

54:34.032 --> 54:35.399
with your male friends

54:35.400 --> 54:37.468
reliving what you see
as happier days gone by

54:37.469 --> 54:40.170
and a chance to see a
young woman partially naked.

54:40.171 --> 54:42.171
Odds are you're questioning
your life choices,

54:42.172 --> 54:46.776
and there's a 42% chance
that you are or will

54:46.777 --> 54:48.843
consider a divorce.

54:49.679 --> 54:51.713
Wow.
Yeah.

54:51.714 --> 54:53.914
So you're only getting
partially naked.

54:54.883 --> 54:57.152
Hey, gentlemen, grab a chair!

54:57.153 --> 54:58.420
Hey, I'm Randy.

54:58.421 --> 54:59.921
- Carl.
- Hey, Ken,

54:59.922 --> 55:01.156
your beer's
looking a little empty there.

55:01.157 --> 55:02.157
You need a re-up?

55:02.158 --> 55:03.357
No, I'm good, man.

55:03.358 --> 55:04.759
Look, Randy, Ken's beer's empty.

55:04.760 --> 55:07.461
I'm gonna grab him
a nice, fresh mug o' beer.

55:07.462 --> 55:09.230
So, Carl, what do you do?

55:09.231 --> 55:11.599
I do background work.

55:11.600 --> 55:14.200
You ever rubbed elbows
with any celebrities?

55:14.201 --> 55:17.003
I did technically rub elbows
with Sean Penn once

55:17.004 --> 55:18.204
in a rugby scrum.

55:18.205 --> 55:19.405
Hey, I think I saw that movie.

55:19.406 --> 55:21.007
Um, what was it called again?

55:21.008 --> 55:22.509
Scrum of the Earth?

55:22.510 --> 55:24.010
Yeah, right.
Yeah, yeah.

55:24.011 --> 55:25.310
This is fun.

55:25.311 --> 55:26.678
Yeah!

55:26.679 --> 55:29.880
Let's play some fucking man poker!

55:32.417 --> 55:35.387
Okay, here we go, boys.

55:35.388 --> 55:37.288
Uh-uh-uh-uh!

55:37.289 --> 55:39.657
Beer! Yeah!

55:39.658 --> 55:41.492
<i>I loved Scrum of the Earth.</i>

55:41.493 --> 55:43.060
It's cool you were in that.

55:43.061 --> 55:44.562
In it?
He had, like,

55:44.563 --> 55:47.131
Sean's Penn's nut sack
just inches from his face.

55:47.132 --> 55:48.265
Could somebody please deal?

55:48.266 --> 55:49.966
Wasn't his nut sack.

55:49.967 --> 55:52.002
It was his character's nut sack.

55:52.003 --> 55:53.970
Oh, that's still awesome.

55:53.971 --> 55:55.272
I guess.

55:55.273 --> 55:56.540
Hey, Ken, how was your stag?

55:56.541 --> 55:58.441
My stag?

55:58.442 --> 56:00.242
It was fucking amazing.

56:00.243 --> 56:02.211
We sat around
a poker table all night

56:02.212 --> 56:04.146
and talked
about Sean Penn's penis.

56:04.147 --> 56:05.813
So what was it like?

56:08.584 --> 56:10.552
Soft and warm, I guess.

56:10.553 --> 56:12.620
No, no, not his...
not his nut sack.

56:12.621 --> 56:14.622
What was it like
working with Sean Penn?

56:14.623 --> 56:17.025
Oh.
I don't know, we...

56:17.026 --> 56:18.393
kept our distance, I guess.

56:18.394 --> 56:19.828
Oh, yeah, professional courtesy.

56:19.829 --> 56:22.029
You guys can't be
gawking over each other

56:22.030 --> 56:24.198
like regular folk, huh?

56:24.199 --> 56:26.266
No, that wouldn't be cool.

56:26.267 --> 56:28.034
I can't believe
what I'm looking at.

56:30.470 --> 56:31.471
Wow.

56:31.472 --> 56:32.338
Huh.

56:32.339 --> 56:35.041
But you know what, Candy,

56:35.042 --> 56:36.509
this doesn't all sound like me.

56:36.510 --> 56:38.477
Read farther down.

56:38.478 --> 56:40.780
"Characteristics
of a mid-life crisis include

56:40.781 --> 56:43.582
the deep sense of remorse
for missed opportunities."

56:43.583 --> 56:44.783
Check.

56:44.784 --> 56:48.053
"The desire to achieve
a feeling of youthfulness."

56:48.054 --> 56:50.355
Check.

56:50.356 --> 56:53.258
"The search of an undefined
dream or goal."

56:53.259 --> 56:56.193
Well, how am I supposed
to know what that is?

56:56.194 --> 56:58.495
That's what undefined means.

56:58.496 --> 57:00.631
Look, don't drive yourself
nuts over this, okay?

57:00.632 --> 57:02.965
I was just making an observation.

57:05.668 --> 57:08.371
All right, you know
what guys? I fold.

57:08.372 --> 57:10.106
The stag party
has officially began!

57:10.107 --> 57:11.241
The stripper's here!

57:11.242 --> 57:13.708
Time to get titties
on the forehead!

57:15.678 --> 57:19.715
<i>I did background work
on Titties On My Forehead</i>

57:19.716 --> 57:21.717
with Ice-T.

57:21.718 --> 57:23.819
So, Carl, what was
Veronica Simpson like?

57:23.820 --> 57:25.654
- Mmm, yeah!
- She was, uh...

57:25.655 --> 57:28.489
She was nice, actually.

57:28.490 --> 57:31.792
Okay, great,
but what was she like?

57:31.793 --> 57:33.461
I mean,
was she smoking hot, or...?

57:33.462 --> 57:35.396
Yeah, she's, um...

57:35.397 --> 57:36.397
She's really pretty.

57:37.699 --> 57:39.032
And, uh...

57:39.033 --> 57:40.734
nice.
Least, she seems nice.

57:40.735 --> 57:42.802
That's nice.
That's good to hear.

57:42.803 --> 57:44.871
Nice? Like she'd
give you the time of day.

57:47.775 --> 57:49.175
<i>She was great in Tiger Bait.</i>

57:49.176 --> 57:50.442
She's got a great ass, though.

57:50.443 --> 57:51.543
Oh, she really does!

57:51.544 --> 57:52.845
I would tap that in a heartbeat.

57:52.846 --> 57:54.513
Okay, guys, that's not really...

57:54.514 --> 57:56.649
I bet she'd be a pretty
good fucking lay.

57:56.650 --> 57:58.450
Yeah, for sure, she would be.

57:58.451 --> 58:00.119
Yeah, yeah.
No, I mean, I'd...

58:00.120 --> 58:01.719
I, for one, would love to,

58:01.720 --> 58:04.589
you know, really lay...
lay her.

58:04.590 --> 58:06.791
She's an actor. How do you
know she's not faking it?

58:06.792 --> 58:08.226
She wouldn't be faking it with me.

58:10.229 --> 58:12.195
Yeah, me, too.

58:12.196 --> 58:13.397
Okay, guys, come on.

58:13.398 --> 58:14.531
But she's an actor, right?

58:14.532 --> 58:15.866
Yeah.
Yeah, sometimes

58:15.867 --> 58:17.200
they're just show
and no substance.

58:17.201 --> 58:18.402
Hey, that's not necessarily...

58:18.403 --> 58:19.836
Still, she's got a great ass.

58:19.837 --> 58:20.837
Great rack, too.

58:20.838 --> 58:22.673
Oh, that's it!
We get Ken implants!

58:22.674 --> 58:23.606
Enough!

58:23.607 --> 58:25.274
Let's just play poker, okay?

58:25.275 --> 58:27.743
You're all talking smack about
a person you never even met.

58:27.744 --> 58:30.746
So let's forget
about Veronica Simpson

58:30.747 --> 58:32.381
and just play mindless poker

58:32.382 --> 58:35.083
with mindless friends, all right?

58:35.084 --> 58:36.651
Okay, Carl.

58:36.652 --> 58:37.452
Sorry.

58:37.453 --> 58:38.553
Sorry, Carl.

58:38.554 --> 58:39.554
Mr. Cranky over here.

58:39.555 --> 58:41.156
You having a rough day?

58:41.157 --> 58:43.858
You have no idea.

58:43.859 --> 58:44.893
Whoa, whoa, hey.

58:44.894 --> 58:46.593
You're not playing again, are you?

58:46.594 --> 58:49.029
Yeah, why the fuck not?

58:49.030 --> 58:51.065
Trying to help you look after
your money, that's all.

58:51.066 --> 58:52.499
That's all right.

58:52.500 --> 58:53.934
I mean, it's okay for you to play,

58:53.935 --> 58:55.536
it's just you need
to know your limit.

58:55.537 --> 58:57.003
You're right, I know.
You're right.

58:57.004 --> 58:58.204
Okay. I'm proud of you.

58:58.205 --> 59:00.807
How much do you think
I should spend?

59:00.808 --> 59:02.675
Well, I don't know I mean,

59:02.676 --> 59:04.944
are you comfortable
with, say, $10?

59:04.945 --> 59:06.679
$10 is good, yeah.

59:06.680 --> 59:08.680
Let's just have a look
and see how much you got left.

59:08.681 --> 59:10.048
What the fuck
is wrong with you two?

59:10.049 --> 59:11.917
What the fuck is wrong with you?

59:11.918 --> 59:12.985
Play the fucking game!

59:12.986 --> 59:14.619
Shut up!
No, you're the fucking homo!

59:14.620 --> 59:15.721
Oh, you're so gay!

59:15.722 --> 59:17.289
You're totally gay!

59:17.290 --> 59:20.358
Can we play more than one
round of fucking poker here?

59:46.149 --> 59:47.182
Hello?

59:47.183 --> 59:48.417
Hi, Daddy!

59:48.418 --> 59:50.552
Isabelle. Hi, sweetie,
how are you?

59:50.553 --> 59:52.453
Good.
Hey, Daddy, guess what?

59:52.454 --> 59:53.788
What?

59:53.789 --> 59:55.990
I did a perfect cartwheel
at gymnastics tonight!

59:55.991 --> 59:59.260
You did? That's great.
You must be so happy.

59:59.261 --> 01:00:00.695
I'm super happy.

01:00:00.696 --> 01:00:02.797
I wish you could have seen it.

01:00:02.798 --> 01:00:04.865
I wish I could have
seen it, too, sweetie.

01:00:04.866 --> 01:00:06.967
I should have been there.
I'm sorry.

01:00:06.968 --> 01:00:08.001
That's okay, Daddy.

01:00:08.002 --> 01:00:09.803
I know you have to stay
and do your work.

01:00:09.804 --> 01:00:12.572
And Mommy videotaped it for you
so you can watch it later.

01:00:12.573 --> 01:00:15.508
She did?
That's great.

01:00:15.509 --> 01:00:17.009
Is work going okay, Daddy?

01:00:17.010 --> 01:00:19.979
Yeah.

01:00:19.980 --> 01:00:21.746
Yeah.

01:00:23.282 --> 01:00:26.117
Hey, Isabelle, I should
probably get going, okay?

01:00:26.118 --> 01:00:28.353
Okay. Will you come tuck
me in when you get home

01:00:28.354 --> 01:00:30.288
and give me a kiss?

01:00:30.289 --> 01:00:32.123
Of course.

01:00:32.124 --> 01:00:33.191
You want to talk to Mommy?

01:00:33.192 --> 01:00:35.493
No, no, no!
No. No, no, no, no, no!

01:00:35.494 --> 01:00:37.528
Just tell Mommy that I am,

01:00:37.529 --> 01:00:39.997
you know, gonna
be home soon, okay?

01:00:39.998 --> 01:00:41.432
Okay. Love you, Daddy.

01:00:41.433 --> 01:00:43.200
I love you, too, pal.
Bye.

01:00:43.201 --> 01:00:44.401
Bye.

01:00:44.402 --> 01:00:47.270
He didn't want to talk to me?

01:00:59.381 --> 01:01:01.149
Hey, Candy.

01:01:01.150 --> 01:01:02.384
Hey, buddy, fuck off.

01:01:02.385 --> 01:01:03.919
Just relax, buddy.

01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:04.719
What's up, Luke?

01:01:04.720 --> 01:01:07.389
Not me.
Get lost, buddy.

01:01:07.390 --> 01:01:08.990
Look, you were totally right

01:01:08.991 --> 01:01:12.059
about the whole
mid-life crisis thing.

01:01:12.060 --> 01:01:13.094
Weird, huh?

01:01:13.095 --> 01:01:15.129
Not really, no.

01:01:15.130 --> 01:01:18.833
Well, anyway, I found out
what my undefined dream is.

01:01:18.834 --> 01:01:20.267
You did?

01:01:20.268 --> 01:01:23.436
Yeah, so thank you.

01:01:23.437 --> 01:01:24.637
I'm gonna take off.

01:01:24.638 --> 01:01:26.806
Peeler! Peeler! Peeler!

01:01:26.807 --> 01:01:31.144
Peeler! Peeler!
Peeler! Peeler!

01:01:31.145 --> 01:01:33.112
Peeler! Peeler!

01:01:33.113 --> 01:01:35.214
Guess that's my cue
for the group show.

01:01:35.215 --> 01:01:40.052
Damn! That's the worst
$60 I ever spent!

01:01:40.053 --> 01:01:41.186
Candy, you know what?

01:01:41.187 --> 01:01:42.621
I mean, you can skip this.

01:01:42.622 --> 01:01:44.021
You know, you don't have to do it.

01:01:44.022 --> 01:01:46.190
I mean, you have so many
followers on your blog,

01:01:46.191 --> 01:01:48.693
like, why don't you just
be a regular writer?

01:01:48.694 --> 01:01:50.962
But I am a regular writer.

01:01:50.963 --> 01:01:53.097
I'm not a victim here, Luke.

01:01:53.098 --> 01:01:57.100
I can assure you that there is a
great sense of power and control

01:01:57.101 --> 01:01:59.603
that comes when you're
totally exposed to someone,

01:01:59.604 --> 01:02:02.305
and yet in absolute
control over them.

01:02:02.306 --> 01:02:04.741
Also makes it dead simple
to get into their psyche.

01:02:04.742 --> 01:02:07.977
Really?
Sure.

01:02:07.978 --> 01:02:09.812
You ever see the look
on a little kid's face

01:02:09.813 --> 01:02:12.180
when they've been
watching TV for too long?

01:02:13.916 --> 01:02:16.385
Like taking candy from a baby.

01:02:17.586 --> 01:02:19.487
Holy shit.

01:02:19.488 --> 01:02:21.756
It was nice meeting you, Luke.

01:02:25.027 --> 01:02:27.461
Here we go.
All right, yeah!

01:02:28.328 --> 01:02:30.963
Yeah!

01:02:33.200 --> 01:02:34.434
Oh, my God!

01:02:34.435 --> 01:02:35.869
That is what I'm talking about!

01:02:37.205 --> 01:02:39.605
What are you, uh...
What are you doing?

01:02:39.606 --> 01:02:41.274
I thought you were leaving.

01:02:41.275 --> 01:02:42.842
Yeah, I just...
I got... Yeah.

01:02:42.843 --> 01:02:45.878
But I have a couple
of minutes, so...

01:02:45.879 --> 01:02:47.246
Hi.

01:02:52.851 --> 01:02:56.087
Take the titties out!

01:02:56.088 --> 01:02:57.255
Please!

01:02:58.624 --> 01:03:01.792
Hey! That's Candy!
That was great!

01:03:01.793 --> 01:03:03.460
Oh, thank you
so much. Okay.

01:03:03.461 --> 01:03:04.762
Round of applause for Candy,

01:03:04.763 --> 01:03:06.030
and we'll see her next time.

01:03:06.031 --> 01:03:07.698
Hey, uh, what the fuck
are you doing?

01:03:07.699 --> 01:03:08.966
She didn't even start yet!

01:03:08.967 --> 01:03:10.234
Well, use your imagination.

01:03:10.235 --> 01:03:11.035
It was starting to...

01:03:11.036 --> 01:03:12.269
What are you really doing?

01:03:12.270 --> 01:03:13.503
Hmm? Oh.

01:03:13.504 --> 01:03:15.305
Well, you told me
to watch your back,

01:03:15.306 --> 01:03:17.674
and I just feel like things are
getting out of control, okay?

01:03:17.675 --> 01:03:18.841
Guys, look it, I don't think

01:03:18.842 --> 01:03:20.510
we need a dancer here tonight.

01:03:20.511 --> 01:03:23.012
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yes, we fucking do!

01:03:23.013 --> 01:03:24.546
Have you lost your fucking mind?

01:03:24.547 --> 01:03:27.516
Yeah, we really do need some
guys stuff right now, Luke!

01:03:27.517 --> 01:03:28.584
You don't have to do this.

01:03:28.585 --> 01:03:30.152
Yes, I do, okay?

01:03:30.153 --> 01:03:33.021
Guys, let me explain.
Give me a second.

01:03:33.022 --> 01:03:36.691
We are grown, mature men.

01:03:36.692 --> 01:03:38.092
Get him!

01:03:39.361 --> 01:03:41.094
No, no, no!

01:03:43.764 --> 01:03:46.433
Wait! Wait! Wait!

01:03:46.434 --> 01:03:48.902
Just a minute, okay?

01:03:48.903 --> 01:03:51.771
I, uh... I came here to dance
for you guys,

01:03:51.772 --> 01:03:53.039
so that's what I'm gonna do.

01:03:53.040 --> 01:03:54.808
Yeah!

01:03:54.809 --> 01:03:56.810
But first, I need to come clean.

01:03:56.811 --> 01:04:00.079
My name isn't Candy.
It's Margaret.

01:04:00.080 --> 01:04:01.747
Yeah, okay, Candy,
Margaret, whatever!

01:04:01.748 --> 01:04:02.982
Take the titties out!

01:04:02.983 --> 01:04:05.217
And I'm actually
not just a stripper.

01:04:05.218 --> 01:04:06.885
I'm a writer.

01:04:06.886 --> 01:04:09.354
And I've been secretly using all
of you in a giant case study.

01:04:09.355 --> 01:04:12.323
So even though the mood
has been killed,

01:04:12.324 --> 01:04:15.560
and it's not something
I want to do right now,

01:04:15.561 --> 01:04:16.828
I'm gonna strip for you.

01:04:16.829 --> 01:04:19.730
But you need to be
aware that you are,

01:04:19.731 --> 01:04:21.031
in a sense, all guinea pigs

01:04:21.032 --> 01:04:22.966
being used in a massive case study

01:04:22.967 --> 01:04:24.201
that will essentially reflect

01:04:24.202 --> 01:04:27.303
how the male species is perceived.

01:04:29.606 --> 01:04:31.841
Yeah, she's gonna strip!

01:04:46.421 --> 01:04:47.789
Yeah!

01:04:47.790 --> 01:04:48.823
Wait!

01:04:50.226 --> 01:04:51.293
Wait!

01:04:51.294 --> 01:04:52.893
What are you doing?

01:04:52.894 --> 01:04:55.296
What are you doing?!

01:04:55.297 --> 01:04:56.430
She's right.

01:04:56.431 --> 01:04:57.665
What the fuck are you doing?

01:04:57.666 --> 01:04:59.033
She's a person.

01:04:59.034 --> 01:05:01.535
Her name is Margaret.

01:05:01.536 --> 01:05:05.238
She has a mom and a dad
and brothers and sisters.

01:05:05.239 --> 01:05:07.974
Look, she's more
than just nice boobs

01:05:07.975 --> 01:05:10.476
and gyrating hips.

01:05:10.477 --> 01:05:12.111
Jesus.

01:05:12.112 --> 01:05:14.080
My whole life, I've been
looked at like an object,

01:05:14.081 --> 01:05:16.315
and not in a good way.

01:05:16.316 --> 01:05:18.550
Been looked at like something

01:05:18.551 --> 01:05:22.854
that's worthless and replaceable.

01:05:22.855 --> 01:05:25.457
Nobody gives a crap
about who I am.

01:05:25.458 --> 01:05:28.359
Oh, my God.
So?

01:05:28.360 --> 01:05:29.994
That feels like shit.

01:05:29.995 --> 01:05:32.396
Then I met this great girl, and...

01:05:32.397 --> 01:05:35.266
This is officially the
worst stag party ever.

01:05:35.267 --> 01:05:37.567
And I treated her the same way,

01:05:37.568 --> 01:05:40.170
so I learned my lesson.

01:05:40.171 --> 01:05:41.971
Margaret, you're free to go.

01:05:41.972 --> 01:05:44.407
Not so fast, Margaret!

01:05:44.408 --> 01:05:47.143
See, I personally don't give
a shit about your name

01:05:47.144 --> 01:05:48.178
or your blog.

01:05:48.179 --> 01:05:49.645
And, Carl, I don't give a shit

01:05:49.646 --> 01:05:51.680
about your sad-sack
fucking story.

01:05:51.681 --> 01:05:54.149
What I do give a shit
about is seeing

01:05:54.150 --> 01:05:57.886
those beautiful tits
on my friend Kenny's head.

01:05:57.887 --> 01:05:59.787
Right, Henry?
Yeah!

01:05:59.788 --> 01:06:01.122
Henry?

01:06:01.123 --> 01:06:03.224
It's just a heartbreaking story.

01:06:03.225 --> 01:06:05.827
Oh, fuck this, Carl!
Get off the stage!

01:06:05.828 --> 01:06:08.463
There is a stripper here
who need to get to work!

01:06:08.464 --> 01:06:11.465
Over my dead body.

01:06:11.466 --> 01:06:12.799
Mine, too.

01:06:12.800 --> 01:06:14.968
That is not gonna
be a fucking problem.

01:06:16.270 --> 01:06:18.105
Yeow!

01:06:18.106 --> 01:06:19.106
Yeow!

01:06:19.907 --> 01:06:21.907
Ohh!

01:06:21.908 --> 01:06:23.008
What was that?

01:06:23.009 --> 01:06:24.009
Christ, Henry, what are you doing?

01:06:24.010 --> 01:06:25.244
Are you all right?

01:06:25.245 --> 01:06:26.979
Oh, I landed on my wallet!

01:06:26.980 --> 01:06:28.981
All right, that's it. Party's over.

01:06:28.982 --> 01:06:30.316
Party's over?
What do you mean, party...

01:06:30.317 --> 01:06:32.151
It's 9:00.

01:06:32.152 --> 01:06:34.018
Finish your drinks and get
the fuck out of my bar!

01:06:34.019 --> 01:06:36.154
Why are you
cursing at me? I'm...

01:06:36.155 --> 01:06:39.222
I'm the dude paying you!

01:06:41.760 --> 01:06:44.762
This is awesome.

01:06:44.763 --> 01:06:47.763
Man, I so wanted to burn your ass.

01:06:49.032 --> 01:06:51.334
I wanted you to burn my ass.

01:06:54.671 --> 01:06:56.672
Rory, let me ask
you something, man.

01:06:56.673 --> 01:06:59.175
For years, you've been carrying
this chip on your shoulder

01:06:59.176 --> 01:07:02.979
from me ruining
your perception thing, right?

01:07:02.980 --> 01:07:04.914
Very much so.

01:07:04.915 --> 01:07:06.181
Weren't you the guy
that we painted

01:07:06.182 --> 01:07:08.383
a gigantic face on his body

01:07:08.384 --> 01:07:11.420
to make his pecker
look like his tongue?

01:07:11.421 --> 01:07:14.756
How does that cause
a mental problem?

01:07:14.757 --> 01:07:16.258
My fiancÃ©e had been suffering

01:07:16.259 --> 01:07:19.026
from low self-esteem
issues in the bedroom.

01:07:19.027 --> 01:07:22.997
When she walked in and saw
me laying there with "it"

01:07:22.998 --> 01:07:24.965
sticking its tongue out at her,

01:07:24.966 --> 01:07:26.500
she was so hurt emotionally,

01:07:26.501 --> 01:07:31.304
she couldn't bring herself
to touch it anymore.

01:07:31.305 --> 01:07:35.475
So I was exiled to
an island of self-pleasure.

01:07:35.476 --> 01:07:37.477
One day, she came into the
bathroom unannounced,

01:07:37.478 --> 01:07:42.247
and I fell backward into the
tub and smacked my head.

01:07:42.248 --> 01:07:45.284
Ever since then,
I've had this condition.

01:07:45.285 --> 01:07:46.618
That's weird.

01:07:46.619 --> 01:07:47.820
Mm-hmm.

01:07:47.821 --> 01:07:50.522
Is it permanent?

01:07:50.523 --> 01:07:52.123
The doctors say
it'll take a few years,

01:07:52.124 --> 01:07:54.826
but it'll eventually go away.

01:07:54.827 --> 01:07:56.527
What about your wife?

01:07:56.528 --> 01:07:57.862
Oh.

01:07:57.863 --> 01:07:59.297
We, uh...

01:07:59.298 --> 01:08:00.832
We've been going
to this sex therapist.

01:08:00.833 --> 01:08:03.200
Oh, nice.
Yeah, and, um...

01:08:03.201 --> 01:08:05.168
You know, ever since then,

01:08:05.169 --> 01:08:06.570
she's been like an animal.

01:08:06.571 --> 01:08:09.339
Okay.
Like a wildebeest or like a jackalope.

01:08:09.340 --> 01:08:10.440
Oh!

01:08:10.441 --> 01:08:12.042
Yeah. She just wants it
all the time.

01:08:12.043 --> 01:08:13.275
Whoa. That's great!

01:08:13.276 --> 01:08:14.977
Yeah.
Well, only problem is,

01:08:14.978 --> 01:08:16.912
you know, with the whole
depth, perception thing,

01:08:16.912 --> 01:08:18.413
I keep trying to dock the boat

01:08:18.415 --> 01:08:19.814
in the wrong slip.

01:08:19.816 --> 01:08:22.017
Keep trying to put
my penis in her bum.

01:08:22.018 --> 01:08:23.085
Yeah, I got it.

01:08:23.086 --> 01:08:24.719
That's not a metaphor.

01:08:24.720 --> 01:08:26.688
I'm gonna head out, pal.

01:08:26.689 --> 01:08:28.089
Of course, you are.

01:08:28.090 --> 01:08:30.325
I mean, why would you stay?

01:08:30.326 --> 01:08:31.359
You okay?

01:08:31.359 --> 01:08:32.160
Oh, I'm fine.

01:08:32.161 --> 01:08:33.928
I'm fucking awesome.

01:08:33.929 --> 01:08:35.095
When people look
back at this event,

01:08:35.096 --> 01:08:36.296
you know what they'll say?

01:08:36.296 --> 01:08:37.096
What?

01:08:37.098 --> 01:08:38.365
Nothing, okay?

01:08:38.366 --> 01:08:40.434
They won't say a damn thing!

01:08:40.435 --> 01:08:43.337
There'll be no memories, no tales,

01:08:43.337 --> 01:08:44.837
no legacy,

01:08:44.839 --> 01:08:46.273
just a guy whose best friends

01:08:46.274 --> 01:08:48.241
don't care about him
enough to abuse him

01:08:48.242 --> 01:08:50.709
at his own stag!

01:08:52.511 --> 01:08:54.412
You okay?

01:08:54.413 --> 01:08:56.381
Yeah, yeah.

01:08:56.383 --> 01:08:58.283
Feel like a bit
of an idiot, though.

01:08:58.283 --> 01:08:59.984
No, no, no.

01:08:59.986 --> 01:09:02.254
That was brave, Henry.

01:09:02.255 --> 01:09:04.956
Poorly executed, but brave.

01:09:04.957 --> 01:09:06.858
Like Jason Statham?

01:09:06.859 --> 01:09:08.392
No.
No.

01:09:11.028 --> 01:09:13.831
Look, about what happened earlier

01:09:13.832 --> 01:09:17.434
in the, uh, alley.

01:09:17.435 --> 01:09:19.270
Yeah. Uh, that.

01:09:19.270 --> 01:09:24.740
Um, well, you know, uh...

01:09:27.210 --> 01:09:29.511
Look,
the fucked-up thing is...

01:09:31.647 --> 01:09:33.180
I didn't hate it.

01:09:33.182 --> 01:09:34.550
It was weird.

01:09:34.551 --> 01:09:35.484
Yeah, it was weird.

01:09:35.484 --> 01:09:37.185
Weird.
Fuckin' weird, but...

01:09:37.185 --> 01:09:39.720
You know, we'll work that out.

01:09:40.689 --> 01:09:41.924
Yeah, yeah.

01:09:41.925 --> 01:09:43.758
Yeah, we'll work that out.

01:09:43.759 --> 01:09:45.593
We'll work it out, but...

01:09:45.594 --> 01:09:48.162
look, keep this
on the fucking downlow, right?

01:09:48.162 --> 01:09:51.698
Yeah, like,
way... fucking low.

01:09:51.700 --> 01:09:52.767
Down there.

01:09:52.768 --> 01:09:54.234
Good.

01:09:54.234 --> 01:09:56.670
All right, let's go
hang with these monkeys

01:09:56.671 --> 01:09:57.804
and get the fuck out of here.

01:09:57.805 --> 01:09:59.271
All right.

01:10:00.140 --> 01:10:01.341
Uh, you got stuff...

01:10:01.342 --> 01:10:02.943
Don't fucking touch me!

01:10:02.944 --> 01:10:05.209
There's just schmutz on your...

01:10:08.447 --> 01:10:10.816
I am so sorry about the mess.

01:10:10.817 --> 01:10:12.318
God.

01:10:12.319 --> 01:10:15.287
It's no problem.
I've seen a lot worse.

01:10:15.288 --> 01:10:17.988
Those guys can be pigs, you know?

01:10:19.090 --> 01:10:21.358
Some of them.

01:10:22.760 --> 01:10:24.596
Hey, Pam,

01:10:24.597 --> 01:10:27.998
let's say, uh, we're
at a family gathering.

01:10:27.999 --> 01:10:31.435
You know, you're there,
and my wife is there.

01:10:31.436 --> 01:10:32.736
Uh-huh.

01:10:32.737 --> 01:10:36.039
I mean, you're not the kind
of person that would talk

01:10:36.040 --> 01:10:38.640
about work when you're
with family anyway, right?

01:10:40.509 --> 01:10:43.145
I'll make you a deal, Uncle Luke.

01:10:43.146 --> 01:10:44.380
I will never talk about this night

01:10:44.381 --> 01:10:46.549
in the presence of our family,

01:10:46.550 --> 01:10:49.818
if you promise never
to say the word "pussy"

01:10:49.819 --> 01:10:51.886
in front of me again.

01:10:51.887 --> 01:10:53.021
I didn't.
Did I say pu...

01:10:53.022 --> 01:10:55.890
Did I say that?
Yeah.

01:10:55.891 --> 01:10:57.158
Deal.
I will... I will...

01:10:57.159 --> 01:10:58.293
I will not do that again.

01:10:58.294 --> 01:10:59.994
I'm surprised I even said it.

01:10:59.995 --> 01:11:01.862
Probably wasn't me.

01:11:01.863 --> 01:11:03.430
But I'll tell the guys
not to do it.

01:11:03.431 --> 01:11:06.166
All right, guys,
I'm gonna get going.

01:11:06.167 --> 01:11:08.367
See you, Randy.

01:11:12.472 --> 01:11:14.873
Ah, well...

01:11:18.344 --> 01:11:21.613
Did I say "pussy"
earlier out loud?

01:11:23.081 --> 01:11:24.682
Unbelievable.

01:11:26.051 --> 01:11:28.954
Hey, Ken, look, I'm sorry
that you didn't have a...

01:11:28.955 --> 01:11:30.756
No, no, no, I get it.

01:11:30.757 --> 01:11:32.656
I'm a dick.

01:11:33.991 --> 01:11:36.027
I'm a dick.

01:11:36.028 --> 01:11:38.396
It's time to stop with all of this

01:11:38.397 --> 01:11:40.931
idiotic behavior
and childish pranks

01:11:40.932 --> 01:11:42.333
and settle down.

01:11:42.334 --> 01:11:45.001
I even know how awesome
Caroline is for me

01:11:45.002 --> 01:11:47.637
and how perfect we are together.

01:11:47.638 --> 01:11:50.507
I just wanted one last night,
though, you know?

01:11:50.508 --> 01:11:53.610
One last night.
I wanted to celebrate.

01:11:53.611 --> 01:11:55.678
I wanted to wear
a stripper's boobs

01:11:55.679 --> 01:11:57.880
on my head like a sailor hat.

01:11:57.881 --> 01:11:59.614
Crazy.

01:12:00.649 --> 01:12:04.720
I'll settle for beers
with my best friends

01:12:04.721 --> 01:12:07.320
and the two gay guys.

01:12:09.023 --> 01:12:11.159
What... We...

01:12:11.160 --> 01:12:12.692
No.

01:12:17.131 --> 01:12:21.834
Oh... my... God.

01:12:31.143 --> 01:12:34.078
I'll mention the great ass thing.

01:12:39.752 --> 01:12:41.052
Hey.

01:12:41.053 --> 01:12:43.121
Hey.

01:12:43.122 --> 01:12:44.589
Uh, how did you...

01:12:44.590 --> 01:12:46.324
You told the wardrobe girl

01:12:46.325 --> 01:12:49.094
that you had a special
gala to attend here?

01:12:49.095 --> 01:12:50.328
Oh, I did?

01:12:50.329 --> 01:12:52.596
Mm-hmm.
And the make-up girl

01:12:52.597 --> 01:12:54.231
and the guy at craft services.

01:12:54.232 --> 01:12:56.734
Okay.
And I said gala?

01:12:56.735 --> 01:12:57.835
Apparently.

01:12:57.836 --> 01:12:59.035
Cool.

01:13:00.871 --> 01:13:04.406
So why are you here?

01:13:06.008 --> 01:13:08.010
I don't know. Um...

01:13:08.011 --> 01:13:09.512
I guess I wanted to tell you

01:13:09.513 --> 01:13:12.080
that you really bug
the shit out of me.

01:13:13.515 --> 01:13:15.517
Okay, message delivered.

01:13:15.518 --> 01:13:17.252
Thank you for coming by.

01:13:17.253 --> 01:13:19.654
But after that horrible experience,

01:13:19.655 --> 01:13:24.526
I guess you maybe bugged
me a little bit less.

01:13:24.527 --> 01:13:26.527
I did?

01:13:26.528 --> 01:13:29.697
Yeah, and then that other guy
came in to finish the scene,

01:13:29.698 --> 01:13:31.332
and we had the whole kiss thing.

01:13:31.333 --> 01:13:33.067
I didn't notice.

01:13:33.068 --> 01:13:35.902
And I realized that you
were the guy in the cage

01:13:35.903 --> 01:13:38.304
the whole time putting up
with my psychotic-ness.

01:13:38.305 --> 01:13:41.574
And, well, it just
didn't really seem fair,

01:13:41.575 --> 01:13:44.910
so I came to bring you this.

01:13:53.619 --> 01:13:55.854
And I wasn't in
character just then.

01:13:55.855 --> 01:13:57.688
That was really me.

01:14:01.926 --> 01:14:03.526
Wow!

01:14:05.463 --> 01:14:08.531
The beer here is awesome.

01:14:09.866 --> 01:14:12.102
So if don't mind hiding your
face from the paparazzi,

01:14:12.103 --> 01:14:13.870
I have a car waiting outside,

01:14:13.871 --> 01:14:16.039
I was thinking maybe we
could grab a late dinner.

01:14:16.040 --> 01:14:17.073
Paparazzi.

01:14:17.074 --> 01:14:18.375
Cool.

01:14:18.376 --> 01:14:23.077
I mean, blood-sucking pricks.

01:14:24.446 --> 01:14:27.082
I have a way out.

01:14:27.083 --> 01:14:29.150
I think they won't see you.

01:14:34.455 --> 01:14:37.392
Hey, would you mind
staying here for a drink?

01:14:37.393 --> 01:14:40.662
I have a favor I want to ask you.

01:14:49.703 --> 01:14:53.873
<i>Sittin' where the stage
is stayin' blue</i>

01:14:53.874 --> 01:14:57.575
<i>Chase around
the soul right out of you</i>

01:14:58.611 --> 01:15:00.646
<i>And everything else</i>

01:15:00.647 --> 01:15:03.216
<i>Just got in my way</i>

01:15:03.217 --> 01:15:05.150
<i>And time was talk</i>

01:15:05.151 --> 01:15:07.818
<i>Would make it all true</i>

01:15:16.527 --> 01:15:20.865
<i>Out jumps a bee
right through my skin</i>

01:15:20.866 --> 01:15:23.701
<i>Each and every time
that you breathe in</i>

01:15:23.702 --> 01:15:25.236
Hey, sweetie.

01:15:25.237 --> 01:15:26.770
Good morning, Daddy.

01:15:26.771 --> 01:15:28.037
Come here.

01:15:28.038 --> 01:15:29.205
<i>Wake myself up</i>

01:15:29.206 --> 01:15:31.808
<i>Man comes around</i>

01:15:31.809 --> 01:15:34.043
<i>Clawed up all the sin</i>

01:15:34.044 --> 01:15:38.080
Daddy?
What's all this?

01:15:38.081 --> 01:15:40.082
<i>Clawed up all the sin</i>

01:15:40.083 --> 01:15:44.686
Hey, what do you say we go
upstairs and wake up Mom,

01:15:44.687 --> 01:15:48.257
and then we go out for a
nice, big pancake breakfast?

01:15:48.258 --> 01:15:51.425
But first, can you tell me
what it was like

01:15:51.426 --> 01:15:53.927
to do a perfect cartwheel?

01:15:57.565 --> 01:16:01.968
Okay.
Well, first over here

01:16:01.969 --> 01:16:03.503
is where my teacher called my name,

01:16:03.504 --> 01:16:06.572
and I was kinda nervous.

01:16:07.908 --> 01:16:08.942
Morning.

01:16:08.943 --> 01:16:12.044
Mmm, morning, sweetie.

01:16:12.045 --> 01:16:13.379
How ya feeling?

01:16:13.380 --> 01:16:15.314
I'm feeling pretty rough.

01:16:15.315 --> 01:16:16.782
Yeah?
Yeah.

01:16:16.783 --> 01:16:18.517
Well, it's no wonder.
You were really drunk

01:16:18.518 --> 01:16:20.085
when they dropped you off on
our front lawn last night.

01:16:20.086 --> 01:16:23.254
And what time was that?
3 A.M.?

01:16:23.255 --> 01:16:24.888
11:15.

01:16:25.957 --> 01:16:27.025
Damn.

01:16:27.026 --> 01:16:28.526
So you had fun?

01:16:28.527 --> 01:16:31.462
It was all right.

01:16:31.463 --> 01:16:34.064
Why, nobody stuck
a pineapple up your ass?

01:16:34.065 --> 01:16:35.332
No, nobody did nothin'.

01:16:35.333 --> 01:16:36.566
Mm-hmm.

01:16:36.567 --> 01:16:38.535
Yeah, you should come over here

01:16:38.536 --> 01:16:41.303
and look at this, uh, scumbag.

01:16:43.106 --> 01:16:45.840
Scumbag?

01:16:47.343 --> 01:16:49.844
Why I gotta be a scumbag?

01:16:54.550 --> 01:16:57.953
That is awesome, baby!

01:16:57.954 --> 01:16:59.688
Look at that!

01:16:59.689 --> 01:17:02.924
I'm the scumbag grabbing
Veronica Simpson's titty!

01:17:02.925 --> 01:17:04.359
Go on, scumbag!

01:17:04.360 --> 01:17:06.461
Scumbag number one.

01:17:06.462 --> 01:17:08.595
<i>It's time for your eTalk update.</i>

01:17:08.596 --> 01:17:10.130
Well, it looks
like Veronica Simpson

01:17:10.131 --> 01:17:12.666
isn't the only one
with her hands full these days.

01:17:12.667 --> 01:17:14.435
Last night, the star took a break

01:17:14.436 --> 01:17:16.370
from her hectic filming schedule

01:17:16.371 --> 01:17:17.771
to drop into a local stag party,

01:17:17.772 --> 01:17:20.073
and was greeted by a few onlookers

01:17:20.074 --> 01:17:21.708
and one groper!

01:17:21.709 --> 01:17:23.643
The man with the hands
was rushed out of the bar

01:17:23.644 --> 01:17:24.944
before police arrived,

01:17:24.945 --> 01:17:27.880
but has been identified
as Ken Andrews.

01:17:27.881 --> 01:17:30.148
A warrant has been
issued for his arrest,

01:17:30.149 --> 01:17:32.951
and Miss Simpson is planning
on pressing charges.

01:17:32.952 --> 01:17:34.886
Rumor has it Veronica was there

01:17:34.887 --> 01:17:37.389
visiting a new love interest.

01:18:58.929 --> 01:19:00.831
<i>When I walk in a room and I</i>

01:19:00.832 --> 01:19:02.833
<i>Hear a beat that I'm feelin',
it makes me high</i>

01:19:02.834 --> 01:19:04.835
<i>Wanna stay in the groove
till the morning time</i>

01:19:04.836 --> 01:19:06.837
<i>Wanna put my hands up in the sky</i>

01:19:06.838 --> 01:19:08.806
<i>Any day of the week, I love to jam</i>

01:19:08.807 --> 01:19:10.540
<i>Doesn't matter what part
of the world I'm in</i>

01:19:10.541 --> 01:19:12.942
<i>Want to have a good time
when I'm with my friends</i>

01:19:12.943 --> 01:19:15.044
<i>When the music is bumpin',
it never ends</i>

01:19:15.045 --> 01:19:16.913
<i>Ever since I was just a kid</i>

01:19:16.914 --> 01:19:18.815
<i>Had rhythm in my feet
everything I did</i>

01:19:18.816 --> 01:19:20.682
<i>Everybody all around me
hit the floor</i>

01:19:20.683 --> 01:19:22.818
<i>Just lovin' them beats
more and more</i>

01:19:22.819 --> 01:19:24.686
<i>I love seein'
when they shake it around</i>

01:19:24.687 --> 01:19:26.822
<i>How they move them hips
all up and down</i>

01:19:26.823 --> 01:19:28.824
<i>From side to side
all ready to rock</i>

01:19:28.825 --> 01:19:30.792
<i>With a lowdown bass line
deep inside</i>

01:19:30.793 --> 01:19:33.194
<i>Roll your belly
to the left and the right</i>

01:19:33.195 --> 01:19:35.062
