_

00:02.148 --> 00:04.081
This girl is everything, yes?

00:04.591 --> 00:05.591
Yes.

00:06.394 --> 00:09.043
Looks like you're at about
12 weeks, give or take.

00:09.465 --> 00:11.426
If that's a traffic ticket,
I can get you out of it.

00:11.466 --> 00:13.286
- Divorce.
- Me too.

00:13.622 --> 00:15.022
Maybe we should um...

00:15.903 --> 00:18.436
- Do dinner?
- I would love that.

00:21.300 --> 00:23.854
Last night, a woman
was attacked in the GOR.

00:24.377 --> 00:25.384
Your mum's OK.

00:25.424 --> 00:27.547
I want you to hear from me
first so you wouldn't worry.

00:27.635 --> 00:30.231
I shouldn't have cried. She
wouldn't have cried for me.

00:30.876 --> 00:32.604
I understand it's your family.

00:32.641 --> 00:35.108
Going back to them feels comfortable.

00:35.133 --> 00:38.420
Because what we do is very, very hard!

00:38.452 --> 00:40.919
But there can't be any doubt, Laurie.

00:41.424 --> 00:42.691
Chief Kevin Garvey.

00:42.721 --> 00:43.818
Thought you went crazy.

00:43.928 --> 00:45.460
That was my dad.

00:45.482 --> 00:47.201
Will you please shut up?

00:47.349 --> 00:49.416
Oh, no. I'm not gonna tell him.

00:49.507 --> 00:50.507
Tell me what?

00:50.615 --> 00:53.348
They said they sent somebody to help you.

00:53.373 --> 00:54.573
Help me with what?

00:54.603 --> 00:57.930
Whatever it is, you might
wanna keep it to yourself.

_

01:48.007 --> 01:49.674
Fuck her. Come on.

02:10.663 --> 02:13.065
Ok. Let me out.

02:13.099 --> 02:16.163
Really, Scotty? It's been 27 minutes.

02:16.188 --> 02:17.335
That's nothing.

02:17.370 --> 02:18.697
Come on! I'm done.

02:18.832 --> 02:21.380
You have, like, a half an hour of air left.

02:21.427 --> 02:23.842
- You little bitch, you're fine.
- Let him out, dick.

02:26.879 --> 02:29.481
Oh! He returns unto us,

02:29.515 --> 02:32.022
unmolested by the great darkness.

02:32.652 --> 02:33.785
Give me a break.

02:33.820 --> 02:36.888
Hey, when he suffocates, do you suffocate?

02:36.923 --> 02:37.956
Har har.

02:37.990 --> 02:39.187
No, really.

02:39.218 --> 02:43.895
Scott frost with a pathetic 28 minutes.

02:43.930 --> 02:46.198
That's not even near the record, buddy.

02:47.600 --> 02:49.429
I can break the record.

02:49.569 --> 02:51.303
Uh, excuse me, Garvey.

02:51.337 --> 02:52.751
You need to do the invocation

02:52.776 --> 02:54.806
before you even attempt the crossing.

02:54.841 --> 02:55.774
That's stupid.

02:55.808 --> 02:57.676
Invo-fucking-cation, Garvey.

03:02.407 --> 03:05.175
"On October 14th, 2011,

03:05.200 --> 03:09.421
"Paul Glouski was forced inside
this conveyance against his will

03:09.455 --> 03:12.657
in a childish prank and was
never seen or heard from again."

03:12.682 --> 03:14.226
"Nor heard from again."

03:14.260 --> 03:16.661
"Nor heard from again.

03:16.931 --> 03:19.098
"Now I honor the mystery of his loss

03:19.123 --> 03:20.524
"by repeating his suffering

03:20.549 --> 03:22.930
and embracing the great darkness."

03:23.570 --> 03:25.405
Amen.

03:25.430 --> 03:27.531
I'll miss you. Be safe.

03:29.385 --> 03:31.252
See you on the other side, Garvey.

03:43.810 --> 03:45.144
Thanks.

04:00.966 --> 04:02.634
You want to come over?

04:06.576 --> 04:07.810
Right now?

04:07.844 --> 04:09.278
Uh-huh.

04:10.980 --> 04:12.162
You sure?

04:12.515 --> 04:15.068
The first 4 dates, I
was on the fence, but...

04:15.652 --> 04:17.185
I'm over it now.

04:19.322 --> 04:22.825
All right. Let me just check in with Jill.

04:27.931 --> 04:30.007
So have you told her about us?

04:30.633 --> 04:32.027
Sure.

04:32.836 --> 04:37.149
"Hey, honey. About to go have sex with Nora

04:37.174 --> 04:39.973
"for the first time.

04:40.810 --> 04:45.488
A little nervous. Wish me luck."

04:46.274 --> 04:47.407
And a winky face.

04:47.432 --> 04:48.666
No, stop.

04:48.691 --> 04:49.791
Ha ha ha!

04:51.621 --> 04:53.095
Send.

05:01.167 --> 05:03.351
_

05:06.770 --> 05:08.637
Yup.

05:10.507 --> 05:12.040
Shit.

05:14.411 --> 05:16.412
Fuck.

05:16.446 --> 05:18.914
21 seconds and you've
got the record, Garvey.

05:32.328 --> 05:34.763
5, 4, 3, 2, 1!

05:34.798 --> 05:36.365
Whoo! You got it!

05:36.399 --> 05:40.536
Aah! Get me out of here!

05:42.238 --> 05:43.439
Shit.

05:43.473 --> 05:44.440
Shit. Fuck.

05:44.474 --> 05:46.041
Oh, my God.

05:46.376 --> 05:47.543
What happened?

05:47.577 --> 05:50.179
- The thing isn't working.
- It's not working.

05:50.213 --> 05:51.947
Get me out of here!

05:51.981 --> 05:52.915
Aah!

05:52.949 --> 05:53.949
Oh, my God!

05:53.983 --> 05:54.950
Aah!

05:56.219 --> 05:57.186
Let me out!

05:57.220 --> 05:58.220
We're gonna get you out! Just wait up.

05:58.254 --> 06:00.155
Find something to open it with!

06:00.190 --> 06:01.123
Fucking shit!

06:01.157 --> 06:02.424
How long? How long?

06:02.459 --> 06:04.624
I can't breathe!

06:05.829 --> 06:06.895
Garvey, it's ok.

06:06.930 --> 06:07.963
Is she breathing?

06:07.997 --> 06:09.765
Somebody fucking call 9-1-1!

06:17.307 --> 06:19.216
Get the fuck back!

06:45.969 --> 06:47.870
Don't tell your dad you saw me.

06:53.376 --> 06:55.048
Who was that?

06:55.478 --> 06:57.141
My grandpa.

08:35.645 --> 08:36.845
Fucker!

08:36.879 --> 08:39.381
Goddamn it.

Ah. Fuck.

08:46.497 --> 08:49.498
_

08:53.663 --> 08:57.132
Hey. Wake up.

08:57.166 --> 08:59.134
I made you some soup.

08:59.168 --> 09:02.871
There's spiders under water.

09:02.905 --> 09:04.906
Christine, come on. You
need to eat something.

09:04.941 --> 09:06.942
I'm not hungry.

09:11.147 --> 09:14.261
You're burning up. The baby--it's--

09:14.286 --> 09:17.133
Nothing can hurt the baby.

09:17.420 --> 09:19.786
He's the one--

09:20.180 --> 09:21.456
the only one.

09:21.491 --> 09:23.571
He's the bridge.

09:23.993 --> 09:27.562
Ok. You need some rest.

09:28.665 --> 09:30.298
Did Wayne call?

09:30.333 --> 09:31.266
No, Christine.

09:31.300 --> 09:33.602
Wayne hasn't called in two months.

09:33.636 --> 09:35.203
He'll call.

09:39.175 --> 09:40.342
Here.

09:44.747 --> 09:46.148
I'll be right back.

09:54.290 --> 09:55.691
Help you?

09:55.725 --> 09:58.360
Uh, yeah. Um, are these
safe for pregnant women?

09:58.394 --> 10:00.362
How far along is she?

10:00.396 --> 10:02.264
Almost 8 months.

10:02.298 --> 10:04.633
She should call her O.B.

10:04.667 --> 10:07.002
Ok. Thanks. I'll do that.

10:20.316 --> 10:22.084
Hello?

10:28.357 --> 10:29.491
Wayne?

10:30.526 --> 10:31.493
Who's this?

10:31.527 --> 10:33.261
It's Tom.

10:33.296 --> 10:37.565
Tom. Tom. Tom!

10:38.201 --> 10:39.401
Of course it is. I know that.

10:39.435 --> 10:41.636
Ha! I called you.

10:41.671 --> 10:43.356
Are you ok?

10:43.906 --> 10:46.356
Oh, I'm great. I'm just great, Tom.

10:46.843 --> 10:49.277
Is Christine with you right now?

10:49.312 --> 10:50.612
No. I'm at a pharmacy, so...

10:50.646 --> 10:53.014
Fine. How much is left?

10:53.049 --> 10:54.149
What?

10:54.183 --> 10:56.985
The money that I gave
you. How much is left?

10:57.019 --> 10:59.788
Uh, about 6,000.

10:59.822 --> 11:01.656
Fuck. All right, Tom.

11:01.691 --> 11:04.439
What you need to do is you
need to take that money,

11:04.464 --> 11:05.773
and you need to take half of it.

11:05.804 --> 11:08.230
That's 3. You need to put it in an envelope

11:08.264 --> 11:10.772
and take that envelope and you seal it

11:11.033 --> 11:14.603
very securely under the mailbox

11:14.637 --> 11:17.139
on Harper and 15th.

11:17.173 --> 11:19.419
It's across from the chicken place.

11:21.110 --> 11:24.112
- When do you need me to go?
- Now, Tom. Fucking now.

11:27.617 --> 11:28.750
And then what?

11:28.785 --> 11:31.974
Tom, don't ask me "then what?"

11:33.556 --> 11:34.790
I'm--I'm sorry.

11:34.824 --> 11:37.259
Uh, it's just Christine is...

11:37.293 --> 11:38.293
You know, she's pretty sick,

11:38.327 --> 11:40.295
and the baby's coming soon, and...

11:40.329 --> 11:43.031
"Naked I came from my mother's womb,

11:43.065 --> 11:47.335
and naked I will depart."

11:49.372 --> 11:51.540
Have you fucked her, Tom?

11:51.607 --> 11:53.615
Have you put it in, just a little?

11:54.811 --> 11:56.011
No.

11:58.681 --> 11:59.648
Just do what I told you to do.

11:59.682 --> 12:01.570
Get the fucking money, yeah?

12:02.185 --> 12:03.385
Yeah.

12:07.023 --> 12:08.590
It won't be long now.

12:33.015 --> 12:35.016
Are you fucking kidding me?

12:44.093 --> 12:45.594
Is this because of me?

12:45.628 --> 12:47.762
Is this Patti's fucking idea?

12:50.833 --> 12:52.493
Ok, I'm asking you to leave.

12:53.069 --> 12:54.636
Right now!

12:54.670 --> 12:57.405
This house is off fucking limits, see?

13:07.817 --> 13:09.384
Want to come inside?

13:14.690 --> 13:16.954
That was fucking fantastic.

13:17.660 --> 13:19.638
Why, thank you.

13:20.263 --> 13:22.192
I usually ignore them.

13:22.565 --> 13:24.699
It's the first time they've been
out there in a couple of months.

13:24.734 --> 13:26.001
Though I'm pretty sure they broke in

13:26.035 --> 13:28.303
and stole some of my family photos.

13:28.337 --> 13:31.039
Ah, on the night of the dance.

13:31.073 --> 13:32.173
On the night I met you.

13:32.208 --> 13:33.575
Right.

13:35.945 --> 13:37.646
Yeah. No, they broke into
a whole bunch of houses...

13:37.680 --> 13:39.247
Basically anyone who...

13:41.984 --> 13:43.752
Lost someone?

13:46.122 --> 13:47.467
Right.

13:48.858 --> 13:50.258
Well, I have to question their strategy.

13:50.293 --> 13:51.559
I mean, that's how they recruit people?

13:51.594 --> 13:53.295
"Oh, no! My family photos are gone.

13:53.329 --> 13:57.032
I better stop talking
and start chain-smoking."

13:58.501 --> 13:59.948
Oh, shit.

14:00.670 --> 14:03.038
- Your wife. I'm...
- Oh, no.

14:03.072 --> 14:04.439
I'm sorry.

14:04.473 --> 14:07.475
Ah, it's ok.

14:17.253 --> 14:18.820
I don't...

14:21.257 --> 14:23.981
I don't know how to talk to you yet.

14:25.928 --> 14:28.053
I don't know how to talk to you, either.

14:30.833 --> 14:32.968
Those fuckers ruined it, huh?

14:37.707 --> 14:39.441
Want to try again tomorrow night?

14:41.911 --> 14:43.144
Absolutely.

14:49.151 --> 14:50.852
Hey.

14:53.422 --> 14:55.557
I thought you weren't coming home tonight.

14:59.925 --> 15:02.063
What's up?

15:02.999 --> 15:04.399
Just ask him.

15:07.470 --> 15:09.804
What? What happened?

15:13.109 --> 15:14.976
What did grandpa do?

15:17.613 --> 15:18.882
Why?

15:19.281 --> 15:20.815
Did he hurt anyone?

15:22.485 --> 15:24.675
- Why are you asking?
- Did he?

15:25.988 --> 15:27.122
Yeah.

15:28.991 --> 15:31.248
And that's why he's in that hospital?

15:32.561 --> 15:33.649
Yes.

15:34.930 --> 15:38.249
Well, he's not anymore.

15:39.902 --> 15:41.102
What?

15:42.571 --> 15:44.721
Chief, this is the only photo I could find

15:44.746 --> 15:46.174
on such short notice.

15:46.208 --> 15:47.706
Everybody's waiting in the pen.

15:47.731 --> 15:48.731
All right. Thanks.

15:48.765 --> 15:49.765
Your daughter saw him, huh?

15:49.799 --> 15:51.367
I mean, what are the odds of that?

15:51.401 --> 15:53.168
Pass out the photos, Dennis.

15:53.203 --> 15:55.016
All right, everybody. Listen up.

15:55.320 --> 15:56.938
As most of you are aware,

15:57.173 --> 16:00.130
a couple of years ago, our former chief

16:00.982 --> 16:04.251
started exhibiting some erratic behavior...

16:04.276 --> 16:07.697
"Erratic"? He burned
down the fucking library.

16:08.786 --> 16:11.186
Following which he
voluntarily remanded himself

16:11.221 --> 16:13.694
to a secure psychiatric facility

16:14.217 --> 16:16.551
which he has just walked out of.

16:16.586 --> 16:19.649
I want patrols working all
residential neighborhoods all night.

16:19.674 --> 16:20.696
Work a grid.

16:20.730 --> 16:22.965
How do you want us to handle
it if we get eyes on him, chief?

16:22.999 --> 16:24.633
Do not engage. Just call me immediately.

16:24.668 --> 16:26.243
Is that understood?

16:26.749 --> 16:28.516
Do you have any idea what he wants?

16:30.041 --> 16:31.541
It doesn't matter what he wants.

16:31.566 --> 16:34.168
What if we find him in a violent situation?

16:36.699 --> 16:38.300
Then you have to stop him.

16:39.617 --> 16:41.051
Dismissed.

16:44.288 --> 16:45.555
4 on this side.

16:45.620 --> 16:47.988
Squawk me if anyone runs out the back.

16:57.200 --> 16:58.634
Chief.

16:58.669 --> 16:59.735
Is he in there?

16:59.770 --> 17:00.870
What?

17:00.904 --> 17:02.900
My father. Is he in there with you?

17:03.874 --> 17:05.241
They let him out?

17:05.275 --> 17:07.500
No. He escaped.

17:08.944 --> 17:10.701
Did anybody get hurt?

17:10.881 --> 17:12.101
Not yet.

17:12.126 --> 17:14.016
I'm gonna have to come in
there and take a look around.

17:14.050 --> 17:15.251
Fuck you, Kevin.

17:15.285 --> 17:17.300
I haven't talked to your father in a month.

17:18.155 --> 17:19.454
What?

17:21.191 --> 17:24.026
I could, uh, ignore the crazy.

17:24.060 --> 17:25.594
Even he could ignore it for a while,

17:25.628 --> 17:28.831
but he just wouldn't shut the fuck up.

17:30.434 --> 17:32.801
Will you call me if he comes here?

17:34.037 --> 17:36.400
He's not coming to me, Kevin.

17:36.973 --> 17:38.541
He's coming to you.

18:15.112 --> 18:16.846
42, domestic disturbance

18:16.880 --> 18:21.951
between two female occupants
at 44...Boulevard...

18:21.985 --> 18:23.853
Copy that.

19:07.464 --> 19:09.398
Cairo.

19:25.048 --> 19:26.916
Come on, chief. I got one trapped.

19:40.263 --> 19:41.363
Dad.

19:45.001 --> 19:46.668
Tommy.

20:06.732 --> 20:08.742
Don't want to shoot.

20:49.099 --> 20:50.466
Aah!

21:53.330 --> 21:54.697
Did you find him?

21:56.533 --> 21:58.400
What?

21:58.435 --> 22:00.769
Grandpa. Did you find him?

22:00.804 --> 22:03.772
Uh, no. No. Not yet.

22:05.675 --> 22:07.943
Why is there a dog tied up in our yard?

22:09.035 --> 22:10.503
Your dad brought him home last night.

22:10.528 --> 22:12.123
I can't believe you didn't wake up.

22:13.717 --> 22:15.918
So, what, it's ours now?

22:15.952 --> 22:19.170
Uh, he's gonna rehabilitate it.

22:19.522 --> 22:20.623
How's your hand?

22:20.657 --> 22:23.329
Did you put neosporin
on it like I told you?

22:25.195 --> 22:26.670
Yeah.

22:27.464 --> 22:29.170
It's...

22:29.699 --> 22:31.170
It's good.

22:31.735 --> 22:32.735
Thanks.

22:39.376 --> 22:40.809
Hello?

22:42.979 --> 22:44.606
Is he ok?

22:44.814 --> 22:46.181
I'll be right there.

22:47.617 --> 22:48.884
I got to go.

23:04.367 --> 23:05.968
No, I don't know yet, sir.

23:08.271 --> 23:09.655
What happened?

23:11.574 --> 23:13.655
It's ok. Just tell me.

23:14.477 --> 23:15.778
Saw him trying to get in,

23:15.812 --> 23:18.644
so I went over to, you know, talk to him.

23:19.082 --> 23:20.749
Why the fuck did you do that, Dennis?

23:20.784 --> 23:22.143
Uh! Aah!

23:24.086 --> 23:25.921
He always liked me.

23:54.818 --> 23:58.153
Excuse me. Did you see
the, uh, man who did this?

23:58.188 --> 23:59.588
No inglés.

24:00.557 --> 24:05.461
Oh. ÿha visto quién hizo éste?

24:05.495 --> 24:06.562
Sí.

24:07.074 --> 24:09.074
_

24:09.795 --> 24:10.996
_

24:11.930 --> 24:14.569
_

24:15.196 --> 24:16.496
_

24:17.474 --> 24:18.674
No.

24:20.515 --> 24:22.005
_

24:22.054 --> 24:25.503
_

24:26.703 --> 24:28.877
_

24:32.100 --> 24:34.218
_

25:24.958 --> 25:26.272
_

26:36.012 --> 26:38.413
Come on. Jesus!

26:38.448 --> 26:41.250
Uh! Will you please?

26:41.284 --> 26:42.417
Uh! Uh!

26:43.453 --> 26:44.987
Get back, motherfucker!

26:45.021 --> 26:45.988
Get back!

26:47.023 --> 26:48.991
This is my house.

26:49.025 --> 26:50.525
Get back!

26:50.560 --> 26:51.793
Give me...

26:51.828 --> 26:55.397
Ah. Hey, honey.

26:56.833 --> 26:58.100
What are you doing?

26:58.134 --> 27:00.226
I know, goddamn it.

27:00.670 --> 27:02.938
I'm not at liberty to say.

27:04.707 --> 27:05.726
You hungry?

27:06.409 --> 27:08.097
Uh, uh-huh.

27:13.648 --> 27:16.116
What the hell happened to my cabinetry?

27:16.619 --> 27:17.920
Deer broke in.

27:17.954 --> 27:19.988
Huh! No shit.

27:24.460 --> 27:26.561
Try not to get trapped in there.

27:28.398 --> 27:29.731
How did you know?

27:31.301 --> 27:33.235
Uh...

27:33.269 --> 27:35.337
I didn't.

27:35.371 --> 27:38.573
I walked out the back door of my residence.

27:38.608 --> 27:40.428
I just started running.

27:41.010 --> 27:42.711
About 10 minutes later,

27:42.745 --> 27:44.379
I come across a bunch of idiots

27:44.414 --> 27:46.281
yelling at a refrigerator.

27:48.351 --> 27:49.918
You expect me to believe that?

27:52.255 --> 27:53.622
Not really.

27:55.458 --> 27:59.131
Your voices... can you hear them right now?

27:59.996 --> 28:01.563
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

28:01.597 --> 28:03.131
What are they saying?

28:06.269 --> 28:07.836
They're saying...

28:10.406 --> 28:13.175
That you look like Snow White.

28:20.470 --> 28:22.838
Could I borrow 200 bucks?

28:23.886 --> 28:25.420
I don't have any cash.

28:25.455 --> 28:26.822
Mmm.

28:28.391 --> 28:30.592
You have any tranquilizers?

28:35.791 --> 28:37.258
Will those help you?

28:37.433 --> 28:39.201
They're not for me.

28:39.235 --> 28:42.390
They're for that dog out
there trying to eat my balls.

28:44.407 --> 28:48.677
Jesus. Why is your dad
taking all this shit?

28:50.313 --> 28:52.614
He's under a lot of pressure, I guess.

28:54.467 --> 28:56.748
Yeah, I reckon he is.

28:56.953 --> 28:58.220
How's your brother?

28:58.254 --> 29:00.719
I haven't talked to him in a while.

29:01.024 --> 29:02.647
You know where he is?

29:03.059 --> 29:04.993
Anywhere that's not here.

29:05.028 --> 29:08.555
Here ain't so bad, sweetheart.

29:10.233 --> 29:11.847
Bingo.

29:14.258 --> 29:15.491
We need some meat.

29:15.972 --> 29:17.339
You got meat?

29:17.373 --> 29:19.296
Why are you drugging the dog?

29:19.542 --> 29:21.176
Because he won't...

29:22.245 --> 29:24.854
She's just trying to help.

29:25.114 --> 29:27.215
- What the fuck do you think I'm...
- Jill!

29:27.250 --> 29:28.550
Disarm system now.

29:28.584 --> 29:31.756
Jill! Jill, where are you?

29:32.355 --> 29:33.955
We're up here!

29:38.161 --> 29:40.295
When did you call him?

29:42.398 --> 29:43.932
Before I let you in.

29:47.003 --> 29:48.203
Good girl.

29:58.214 --> 30:00.148
I borrowed your sweatshirt.

30:23.331 --> 30:24.931
I'll take him back.

30:26.075 --> 30:27.209
Ok.

30:45.528 --> 30:46.993
Dennis ok?

30:48.297 --> 30:50.493
He's gonna need stitches.

30:50.633 --> 30:53.493
He's a nice guy. Tell him I'm sorry.

30:53.603 --> 30:55.493
He just got in my way.

30:57.140 --> 30:58.993
How you sleeping?

30:59.542 --> 31:00.809
What?

31:00.843 --> 31:03.993
You have a fucking
pharmacy on your nightstand.

31:05.014 --> 31:06.314
That shit fucks with your head.

31:06.349 --> 31:07.993
Thanks for the advice.

31:09.085 --> 31:11.186
You used to take my advice.

31:13.222 --> 31:14.990
You're not gonna ask me, are you?

31:15.024 --> 31:16.492
Ask you what?

31:16.859 --> 31:18.635
Why I busted out.

31:18.794 --> 31:21.103
Dad, I don't need this shit right now.

31:21.731 --> 31:24.099
Maybe it's exactly what you need.

31:24.133 --> 31:25.467
What the fuck does that even mean?

31:25.535 --> 31:27.802
Stop!

31:29.105 --> 31:31.394
Damn it! What the fuck!

31:31.556 --> 31:33.758
Jesus fucking Christ.

31:36.712 --> 31:37.746
Get the fuck out of my way.

31:37.780 --> 31:39.181
Get out of my way!

31:42.585 --> 31:43.919
Fuck!

31:43.953 --> 31:45.720
Fuck! Fuck!

31:45.755 --> 31:47.722
Get out of my fucking way.

31:57.689 --> 31:58.992
_

32:06.542 --> 32:07.809
Fuck.

32:09.512 --> 32:10.779
Goddamn it.

32:40.109 --> 32:41.443
Bitch...

32:41.477 --> 32:43.278
Never!

32:43.312 --> 32:45.380
Dude, seriously?

32:48.217 --> 32:49.688
What are you using my credit card for?

32:49.713 --> 32:51.119
Don't worry about it. I'll pay you back.

32:51.153 --> 32:52.988
It's just that if you go over the limit,

32:53.022 --> 32:54.343
I'm gonna have to tell...

32:54.368 --> 32:55.435
Aah!

32:55.589 --> 32:56.656
Come on!

32:56.681 --> 32:58.482
That's right.

32:59.362 --> 33:01.997
Are you watching these two fuck, Garvey?

33:02.031 --> 33:04.523
She's ordering something
secret from the Internet.

33:05.468 --> 33:08.003
How long is it gonna take you
to get ready for Dixon's party?

33:08.037 --> 33:11.346
It won't take me long at
all, dipshit. I'm not going.

33:11.540 --> 33:14.502
So, what, are you just gonna hang
around here with my dad all night?

33:14.810 --> 33:16.652
He's not gonna be here.

33:16.946 --> 33:18.280
How do you know?

33:18.314 --> 33:21.890
'Cause whenever you go out, he goes out.

33:22.385 --> 33:26.288
I suspect with a lady friend.

33:27.356 --> 33:28.690
Oh.

33:31.227 --> 33:32.394
Ok.

33:32.428 --> 33:34.329
Ow! Goddamn...

33:34.363 --> 33:35.697
Damn it!

33:36.599 --> 33:37.766
Uh!

34:37.893 --> 34:39.027
Yeah?

34:39.995 --> 34:41.574
I'm here to see Wayne.

34:43.264 --> 34:44.766
Who the fuck are you?

34:46.835 --> 34:48.074
Wayne!

34:48.704 --> 34:50.553
I know you're in here, Wayne!

34:50.940 --> 34:52.107
Wayne!

35:00.783 --> 35:02.283
Don't fucking move!

35:02.318 --> 35:03.752
Whoa. Take it easy.

35:03.786 --> 35:05.734
You ok, Liane?

35:06.622 --> 35:08.667
How does he know about Wayne?

35:09.191 --> 35:11.470
I'm the one who dropped off the money.

35:11.861 --> 35:13.194
I just wanted to talk to him.

35:13.229 --> 35:14.729
Why?!

35:14.764 --> 35:17.966
Because I have one, too.

35:18.000 --> 35:19.801
One of what?!

35:24.106 --> 35:25.407
One of her.

35:47.062 --> 35:48.553
Hey, Mr. Garvey.

35:49.799 --> 35:50.799
Where's Jill?

35:50.833 --> 35:52.400
She went out.

35:57.039 --> 35:59.385
So you brought your dad back, huh?

36:00.075 --> 36:01.075
Still working on it.

36:07.450 --> 36:09.684
You might want to feed that thing.

36:11.787 --> 36:13.221
Your new dog.

36:14.757 --> 36:16.856
Oh. Yeah.

36:18.727 --> 36:20.662
You don't remember, do you?

36:22.731 --> 36:24.199
What?

36:24.233 --> 36:26.000
Last night.

36:27.770 --> 36:29.371
Getting the dog.

36:29.939 --> 36:31.639
Of course I remember.

36:31.674 --> 36:33.508
Then what did you say to me

36:33.542 --> 36:35.912
when I bandaged up your hand?

36:38.686 --> 36:41.071
We really like having
you here with us, Aimee.

36:41.584 --> 36:43.119
Do you like it here?

36:43.586 --> 36:44.883
Yeah.

36:46.355 --> 36:47.689
Good.

37:24.924 --> 37:26.391
It's ok.

37:26.762 --> 37:28.129
It's ok.

37:29.532 --> 37:31.432
All right.

37:31.467 --> 37:33.034
Go get it.

38:15.697 --> 38:19.098
_

38:22.420 --> 38:24.570
_

38:33.929 --> 38:36.331
- Hello?
- Is Reverend Jamison here?

38:36.365 --> 38:38.199
No. May I help you?

38:38.233 --> 38:39.534
Matt!

38:40.336 --> 38:41.803
Mr. Matt is not here.

38:41.837 --> 38:43.037
Matt!

38:52.047 --> 38:53.081
Where's your phone?

38:53.115 --> 38:54.415
Why?

38:54.450 --> 38:56.718
Because if I call from
mine, he's not gonna pick up.

38:58.354 --> 39:00.088
Call him right now!

39:01.622 --> 39:03.917
_

39:05.027 --> 39:08.429
Hello. Mr. Matt, there's--

39:08.464 --> 39:10.965
Matt, it's Kevin Garvey.
Is my father with you?

39:11.000 --> 39:12.934
Uh, Kevin, I--no.

39:12.968 --> 39:14.335
What makes you think so?

39:14.370 --> 39:18.006
I think so because he was
just in my fucking backyard

39:18.073 --> 39:19.474
digging up a jar full of cash

39:19.508 --> 39:22.243
with one of your goddamn fliers in it!

39:23.379 --> 39:24.379
Kevin, I--

39:24.413 --> 39:26.714
is he with you or not?

39:29.618 --> 39:32.553
He's almost ready to see you, but...

39:32.588 --> 39:34.629
We need to get something first.

39:35.190 --> 39:36.991
No. You're not getting shit,

39:37.026 --> 39:40.581
not until you tell me where
you are, right fucking now.

39:41.130 --> 39:43.898
Meet us at Sonny's off
route 17, 90 minutes.

39:43.932 --> 39:45.900
Matt...

39:45.934 --> 39:47.301
Matt!

39:47.336 --> 39:49.137
Motherfucker!

40:13.962 --> 40:17.293
Jesus. You were there
the night of the raid.

40:17.566 --> 40:19.500
Yeah, I was there.

40:19.535 --> 40:23.504
Fuck. So many people. I'm sorry
I didn't recognize you, man.

40:23.539 --> 40:25.801
- How did you get out?
- One of the tunnels.

40:26.141 --> 40:28.437
Wayne met up with us at
this fucking rest stop,

40:28.462 --> 40:31.212
gave us some cash, a phone,

40:31.246 --> 40:32.447
looked at me, and then said,

40:32.481 --> 40:34.215
"This girl...

40:34.249 --> 40:38.052
She's everything, yes?"

40:38.087 --> 40:39.887
Motherfucker.

40:39.922 --> 40:41.589
Word for word, man.

40:41.623 --> 40:43.254
Which one?

40:43.459 --> 40:44.559
What?

40:44.593 --> 40:47.729
Which girl? Who are you with?

40:47.763 --> 40:49.137
Christine.

40:49.932 --> 40:51.599
Is she pregnant?

40:52.935 --> 40:55.509
And the baby is Wayne's?

40:56.038 --> 40:57.339
It's not mine.

41:01.443 --> 41:03.377
How many others do you think he's got?

41:03.412 --> 41:04.746
Does it matter?

41:18.761 --> 41:20.428
Did he ever hug you, man?

41:20.959 --> 41:22.468
No.

41:22.598 --> 41:24.226
'Cause he did it to me,

41:24.800 --> 41:28.369
and it was... It was so fucking real, man.

41:31.974 --> 41:33.946
He took away all my pain.

41:40.048 --> 41:41.082
There's got to be a reason

41:41.116 --> 41:43.459
he didn't tell us about each other.

41:44.386 --> 41:45.453
He's got to have a plan.

41:45.487 --> 41:46.854
There's no fucking plan, dude.

41:49.161 --> 41:50.170
Jesus! Jesus Christ!

41:50.246 --> 41:52.460
- Wayne, Wayne, where is that whore?!
- Jesus Christ!

41:54.696 --> 41:55.963
Aah! Fuck!

41:55.998 --> 41:57.565
My baby!

41:57.599 --> 41:58.900
Goddamn it!

41:58.934 --> 42:01.435
He said it would be my baby!

42:01.470 --> 42:03.237
He promised me.

42:03.272 --> 42:06.040
He's the one. He's the only one!

42:06.074 --> 42:07.809
He's the bridge!

42:11.213 --> 42:12.580
Shh. Shh.

42:12.614 --> 42:14.282
He's the one.

42:37.172 --> 42:40.408
They just got here. Want us to grab them?

42:40.442 --> 42:41.475
No. Let them come in.

42:41.510 --> 42:42.844
Copy that.

42:54.523 --> 42:56.041
Kevin.

42:56.959 --> 43:00.228
Reverend, could you give
us a few minutes, please?

43:00.262 --> 43:01.662
I'll be at the counter.

43:01.697 --> 43:03.297
Thank you.

43:04.900 --> 43:06.893
Picked your favorite place.

43:07.736 --> 43:09.919
The only way I could
get you to go to church

43:09.944 --> 43:12.039
was promise you fries and a shake.

43:16.111 --> 43:18.326
Will you please take these off?

43:18.413 --> 43:19.714
No.

43:19.748 --> 43:21.030
Come on.

43:21.055 --> 43:23.684
I saw two units in the parking lot.

43:23.719 --> 43:27.622
I hired that fat-ass 3
booths back. I won't run.

43:28.891 --> 43:30.558
You have my word.

43:34.396 --> 43:35.696
Come on.

43:59.554 --> 44:01.188
What's this?

44:03.825 --> 44:05.159
Son, you need to know,

44:05.193 --> 44:07.795
I wanted to keep you out of this.

44:07.829 --> 44:10.809
I tried to change their minds,

44:11.033 --> 44:13.034
but they wouldn't stop.

44:14.436 --> 44:16.404
They would never stop.

44:21.877 --> 44:23.645
I couldn't find it in the library,

44:23.670 --> 44:27.407
so I had to go to some asshole
in Gabota that sells them.

44:27.482 --> 44:32.720
May 1972. They were very specific.

44:33.689 --> 44:35.122
It had to be this one.

44:42.931 --> 44:45.232
What am I supposed to do with this?

44:45.267 --> 44:47.253
I need you to take it.

44:47.836 --> 44:49.290
Why?

44:49.805 --> 44:51.865
Please, Kevin. Just take--

44:52.007 --> 44:54.775
What fucking difference does it make, huh?

44:57.479 --> 44:59.513
Oh, God.

45:02.451 --> 45:05.553
You need to accept it.

45:05.587 --> 45:07.755
Dad, what does that even mean?

45:10.892 --> 45:13.739
I know you think I'm fucking crazy,

45:14.596 --> 45:16.197
but I'm not.

45:16.231 --> 45:17.898
I'm not, Kevin.

45:17.933 --> 45:23.270
What I hear-- what they say--

45:23.305 --> 45:26.098
it is the goddamn truth.

45:26.308 --> 45:28.171
It's the truth, son.

45:30.645 --> 45:32.213
They don't tell me what they don't--

45:32.247 --> 45:35.514
Oh, Jesus Christ.

45:36.585 --> 45:39.977
I'm trying. This isn't easy.

45:40.822 --> 45:43.457
Ok. I'll--I'll tell him.

45:47.162 --> 45:50.001
Listen to me. Just listen to me.

45:51.600 --> 45:53.426
The lucky ones...

45:54.936 --> 45:56.548
They're not needed.

45:56.805 --> 46:00.088
They get to stay sane.

46:01.109 --> 46:02.643
But we...

46:05.714 --> 46:08.549
We're in the fucking
game now, you understand?

46:08.583 --> 46:11.018
That whistle blew 3 years ago,

46:11.053 --> 46:14.439
and you cannot ignore it anymore.

46:14.990 --> 46:17.324
Your services are being requested.

46:17.359 --> 46:19.835
Eyes open, wide awake.

46:21.196 --> 46:23.230
This is your invitation.

46:24.433 --> 46:25.933
This is your purpose.

46:25.967 --> 46:28.803
This is what you fucking accept.

46:31.239 --> 46:33.779
So now I have a purpose?

46:34.209 --> 46:36.977
Context is everything, son.

46:42.517 --> 46:44.785
Where did you go, dad?

46:48.757 --> 46:50.559
I'm right here.

46:50.992 --> 46:53.101
You left me.

46:53.962 --> 46:56.602
You left me when I needed you.

46:57.232 --> 46:59.700
Now you want to infect me

46:59.734 --> 47:02.136
with whatever it is you got.

47:04.539 --> 47:08.583
I don't accept your bullshit.

47:09.377 --> 47:12.213
I have responsibilities. I have...

47:12.247 --> 47:14.070
Commitments.

47:15.150 --> 47:17.451
I'm not gonna leave my family.

47:20.722 --> 47:22.123
Uh!

47:24.126 --> 47:25.226
You know.

47:25.260 --> 47:28.295
Inside you, you know this is real,

47:28.330 --> 47:30.364
and that makes you a coward.

47:30.398 --> 47:32.733
- A coward?
- You don't want it,

47:32.767 --> 47:34.969
you don't want what I have,

47:35.534 --> 47:36.801
then I relieve you of it.

47:36.888 --> 47:37.922
Sit down.

47:37.947 --> 47:39.707
- I relieve you.
- Dad, calm down.

47:39.741 --> 47:43.043
Just don't wake up. Just stay asleep.

47:43.078 --> 47:45.179
Just go back to sleep.

47:45.213 --> 47:47.982
Don't wake up. Don't anybody wake up!

47:48.016 --> 47:51.285
Go to sleep! Go back to fucking sleep!

49:09.197 --> 49:11.031
You'll come see me on Sunday?

49:11.066 --> 49:12.499
Of course.

49:22.677 --> 49:25.512
They're not gonna let
you off that easy, son.

50:01.049 --> 50:02.483
What?

50:02.517 --> 50:05.519
"Said the father, my dear son,

50:05.553 --> 50:07.755
"relate not thy vision to thy brothers,

50:07.789 --> 50:09.785
lest they concoct a plot against..."

50:09.810 --> 50:11.544
Fuck you, Matt.

50:51.266 --> 50:52.733
Hi.

50:52.767 --> 50:54.368
Hey.

52:36.194 --> 52:38.450
_

52:52.941 --> 52:54.088
_

53:19.414 --> 53:20.981
Hey.

53:23.017 --> 53:24.518
Hey.

53:26.521 --> 53:28.038
Are you ok?

53:29.290 --> 53:31.181
Oh, yeah.

53:32.160 --> 53:34.117
You want to talk about it?

53:53.982 --> 53:56.529
I think I might be going crazy.

54:00.021 --> 54:03.290
Well, my friend, you've
come to the right place.

54:26.180 --> 54:27.614
Morning.

54:27.649 --> 54:28.849
Morning.

54:28.883 --> 54:31.051
Morning.

54:31.085 --> 54:33.053
So, were you working all night?

54:35.223 --> 54:37.439
I was actually with a friend.

54:38.459 --> 54:39.560
Oh.

54:39.594 --> 54:41.461
I think you'd like her.

54:41.496 --> 54:44.031
We've got to find time
to get together soon.

54:47.802 --> 54:49.469
What is this?

54:49.504 --> 54:51.071
What?

54:51.105 --> 54:54.018
This. What the fuck is it doing here?

54:54.509 --> 54:56.209
I ordered it for grandpa.

54:56.244 --> 54:57.778
He told you to order this?

54:57.812 --> 55:00.213
No. He dropped a piece of paper.

55:00.248 --> 55:01.515
What's your problem?

55:01.549 --> 55:03.116
I don't have a fucking problem.

55:03.151 --> 55:04.451
What the fuck, dad?

56:03.211 --> 56:04.811
Tom?

56:28.202 --> 56:30.170
Christine?

56:30.914 --> 56:32.331
Hello!

56:55.997 --> 56:57.731
It's a girl.
