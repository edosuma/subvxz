00:20.600 --> 00:21.919
Hey.

00:24.600 --> 00:26.033
You....

00:26.600 --> 00:28.272
You selling?

00:29.280 --> 00:30.952
I don't know
what you're talking about.

00:31.160 --> 00:33.276
Okay. That's cool.

00:35.680 --> 00:39.514
I'm just saying, you know,
if you were selling...

00:39.840 --> 00:42.115
...I could maybe do with a teenth.

00:44.920 --> 00:46.512
You're kidding, right?

00:47.480 --> 00:49.710
Dude, I so smell bacon.

00:49.920 --> 00:52.115
What? What are you talking about?

00:52.320 --> 00:53.912
Oh, gee, I don't know.

00:54.120 --> 00:56.839
How about over there.
That brown van.

00:58.000 --> 00:59.115
That's yours, right?

00:59.320 --> 01:01.151
What brown van?

01:01.400 --> 01:03.436
Parked all inconspicuous.

01:03.640 --> 01:05.631
It's a cop van.

01:06.200 --> 01:08.760
Yeah, another one right over there.

01:09.560 --> 01:12.074
"Duke City Flowers"? Come on.

01:12.280 --> 01:14.236
Can't you at least be original?

01:14.440 --> 01:16.749
Dude, I just wanna get high.

01:16.960 --> 01:19.076
A flower van.

01:19.680 --> 01:22.274
You know what you should do
is a garbage truck.

01:22.480 --> 01:24.357
Seriously, and I don't mean
to disrespect...

01:24.560 --> 01:27.028
...but if you put cops
in the back of a garbage truck...

01:27.240 --> 01:29.231
...there's no way
I'm seriously thinking...

01:29.440 --> 01:32.591
...that there's cops
in the back of a garbage truck.

01:33.080 --> 01:35.310
It's a freebie, yo. Just think about it.

01:35.520 --> 01:37.590
Think about it, boys.

01:38.640 --> 01:41.473
All right. I'm hitting it.

01:42.480 --> 01:44.038
You dudes give up that easy?

01:44.240 --> 01:46.151
I'm not a cop.

01:46.720 --> 01:50.156
Then lift your shirt.
Show me you're not wearing a wire.

01:51.880 --> 01:53.279
All right, you know what?

01:53.480 --> 01:56.153
Just to show you
you're being an asshole.

01:56.360 --> 01:58.351
I'm blinded by white.

01:58.560 --> 01:59.515
Douchebag.

01:59.720 --> 02:02.109
Come on. I was joking. Come on.

02:02.320 --> 02:05.551
Don't walk away angry.
Sit down. Come on.

02:07.280 --> 02:08.918
I mean, what are you
complaining about?

02:09.120 --> 02:11.270
You got abs, man. Kind of.

02:11.480 --> 02:13.277
Whatever, dude.

02:13.480 --> 02:15.118
I'm not even sure
I wanna buy anymore.

02:15.320 --> 02:17.880
I think you turned me off
to the whole thing.

02:18.080 --> 02:20.036
Come on. Don't be like that.

02:20.240 --> 02:23.312
I just need you to prove it,
you know?

02:23.520 --> 02:24.953
Prove you're not a cop.

02:25.160 --> 02:27.754
How the hell
am I supposed to do that?

02:28.600 --> 02:30.192
I don't know.

02:31.360 --> 02:34.591
Hey, I got it. Go over there
and punch that dude right in the face.

02:34.800 --> 02:36.472
Which dude?

02:36.680 --> 02:37.874
-That dude?
-Yeah.

02:38.080 --> 02:40.435
No way. He'd kick my ass.

02:41.360 --> 02:42.839
True that.

02:44.080 --> 02:47.277
-This is so hard, you know?
-Yeah.

02:49.960 --> 02:51.439
I know.

02:51.680 --> 02:53.398
It's simple.

02:53.720 --> 02:57.872
If you ask a cop if he's a cop,
he's, like, obligated to tell you.

02:58.080 --> 02:59.877
It's in the Constitution.

03:00.080 --> 03:02.116
Constitution of America?

03:04.280 --> 03:06.874
So go ahead and ask.

03:07.080 --> 03:09.275
-You a cop?
-No, no. Not like that.

03:09.480 --> 03:11.516
Ask it, like, official.

03:11.720 --> 03:14.188
Are you a police officer?

03:14.720 --> 03:18.110
No, I am not a police officer.

03:18.320 --> 03:21.232
Okay, then. Hundred
and seventy-five for a teenth.

03:22.240 --> 03:24.117
The price is the price, yo.

03:28.400 --> 03:29.992
All right.

03:54.520 --> 03:57.193
There you go. Enjoy.

03:58.080 --> 03:59.718
Thanks, man.

04:05.600 --> 04:08.433
Albuquerque Police!
You're under arrest! Get on the ground!

04:08.640 --> 04:12.918
Get on your stomach now!
On your stomach! Get on the ground!

04:13.960 --> 04:16.872
Hold it right there. Don't move.
Stay down.

04:37.240 --> 04:41.916
I had a good job
until my boss accused me of stealing.

04:43.080 --> 04:44.957
I'd better call Saul!

04:48.000 --> 04:51.231
I was out partying,
minding my own business....

04:52.600 --> 04:55.956
-You are under arrest.
-I'd better call Saul!

04:56.840 --> 04:57.875
Hi, I'm Saul Goodman.

04:58.080 --> 04:59.718
Did you know that you have rights?

04:59.920 --> 05:02.275
The Constitution says you do.
And so do I.

05:02.480 --> 05:04.357
I believe that until proven guilty...

05:04.560 --> 05:07.597
...every man, woman,
and child in this country is innocent.

05:07.800 --> 05:09.677
And that's why I fight for you,
Albuquerque.

05:09.880 --> 05:10.835
Better call Saul.

05:11.040 --> 05:13.031
Saul Goodman, attorney at law,
505-164-CALL.

05:13.240 --> 05:16.118
That's 505-164-CALL.

05:17.760 --> 05:21.275
I really need to get some furniture.

05:22.560 --> 05:23.959
I suggest you start with a bed.

05:27.240 --> 05:29.674
God, I wish we could smoke in here.

05:29.880 --> 05:33.077
-Well, you can't.
-Yeah, no. I know.

05:33.280 --> 05:35.191
I'm just saying.

05:37.520 --> 05:39.272
Don't think I can't smell that weed.

05:39.480 --> 05:41.277
You better seriously hope
that airs out.

05:41.480 --> 05:44.119
My dad will keep
your security deposit.

05:45.280 --> 05:48.431
He has a nose
like a damn bloodhound.

05:48.640 --> 05:50.198
Yeah?

05:50.400 --> 05:54.439
Has he ever caught you?

05:55.360 --> 05:59.069
Yeah. Many times.

06:00.240 --> 06:01.832
Well, listen.

06:02.560 --> 06:05.711
Since I already lost my deposit
and all...

06:05.920 --> 06:08.388
...maybe we should light up.

06:12.160 --> 06:13.752
No, thanks.

06:13.960 --> 06:14.915
You sure?

06:16.400 --> 06:18.709
Well, is it cool if I burn one?

06:18.920 --> 06:21.070
Maybe you'll change your mind.

06:25.240 --> 06:27.117
Do what you wanna do, I guess.

06:32.920 --> 06:35.115
Hey. What'd I say?

06:35.640 --> 06:37.073
Nothing.

06:38.240 --> 06:40.117
I just have to go is all.

06:58.800 --> 06:59.755
What's this?

07:01.280 --> 07:02.793
My 18-month chip.

07:05.400 --> 07:06.355
I'm in recovery.

07:06.560 --> 07:11.953
And, you know,
pot is like stepping stones.

07:14.240 --> 07:18.233
Recovery? That's cool.

07:18.440 --> 07:19.714
Right on.

07:20.480 --> 07:21.993
I respect that.

07:22.200 --> 07:24.919
You know,
I don't really burn much anymore.

07:25.120 --> 07:27.918
It's just a sometime thing.

07:29.040 --> 07:31.952
But no more, like, in the house.

07:35.360 --> 07:38.477
So you wanna go grab
some dinner?

07:38.680 --> 07:41.069
I could really go for some Chinese.

07:41.280 --> 07:42.679
No, I better hit it.

07:44.360 --> 07:45.952
We....

07:46.280 --> 07:47.793
We cool?

07:51.200 --> 07:52.713
Your satellite is on, by the way.

07:56.120 --> 07:58.156
That screen is badass.

08:11.880 --> 08:13.871
I just think it's asking a lot.

08:14.080 --> 08:15.991
He knows it.

08:16.200 --> 08:17.792
He's done nothing but apologise.

08:19.320 --> 08:20.799
Is this gonna be
every weekend now?

08:21.000 --> 08:24.151
No. It's just the end of the quarter.
You remember how that was.

08:24.360 --> 08:28.751
But I am earning double time,
so there's a bright side.

08:28.960 --> 08:31.235
So when the laziest boy
in the world wakes up...

08:31.440 --> 08:33.317
...tell him he better wash
those sneakers.

08:33.520 --> 08:34.475
And I said bye.

08:34.679 --> 08:36.909
And tell him
to let them air-dry this time.

08:37.120 --> 08:39.759
I don't want him
banging the hell out of my dryer.

08:40.559 --> 08:41.515
What?

08:43.080 --> 08:45.196
What, you don't even get
casual Saturday?

08:45.400 --> 08:46.435
I mean....

08:46.640 --> 08:48.232
No, it's just you....

08:48.440 --> 08:50.271
You look nice is all.

08:50.480 --> 08:52.596
It's work, Walt.
And everybody is gonna be there.

08:53.720 --> 08:54.675
-Okay.
-Okay.

08:54.880 --> 08:57.235
Maybe we'll order a pizza tonight?

08:57.440 --> 08:58.793
Okay.

08:59.480 --> 09:00.435
-Bye.
-Bye.

09:12.360 --> 09:15.272
Hi. You've reached Walt,
Skyler and Walter, Jr.

09:15.480 --> 09:17.710
Please leave a message,
and we'll get back to you.

09:17.920 --> 09:22.232
Skyler? Are you there?
I don't know what to do.

09:22.440 --> 09:25.876
I.... I need to talk to you. I....

09:26.080 --> 09:29.470
Hey, Marie. It's me. What's up?

09:35.880 --> 09:38.440
Yesterday I got home
and found him.

09:39.080 --> 09:41.469
He didn't even tell me
he was coming.

09:41.960 --> 09:45.236
-A man was killed?
-A Federale, right in front of him.

09:46.120 --> 09:49.351
Three agents wounded,
one lost his leg.

09:49.560 --> 09:53.030
It's like what you hear about
from lraq or something.

09:53.240 --> 09:55.913
-The lEDs.
-Oh, Jesus.

09:56.120 --> 09:58.839
I had to hear about it
from Steve Gomez.

09:59.040 --> 10:01.349
Hank talked to his ASAC
for about an hour.

10:01.560 --> 10:04.677
Hank could win an Oscar.
He's so damn breezy with the man.

10:04.880 --> 10:07.792
He hangs up the phone,
goes right back to bed.

10:08.000 --> 10:13.597
And all he keeps saying is,
"I'm fine. I'm fine. Leave me alone."

10:36.760 --> 10:38.352
Baby, not now.

10:39.600 --> 10:42.398
It's-- It's me, Hank. Sorry.

10:46.080 --> 10:47.957
Hey, buddy. What's...?

10:48.160 --> 10:49.639
What's up?

10:51.920 --> 10:53.399
I just....

10:53.840 --> 10:55.876
Do you mind if l...?

10:56.160 --> 10:57.991
No. No.

11:00.080 --> 11:01.718
So....

11:04.920 --> 11:05.989
How you doing?

11:06.560 --> 11:09.120
Oh, you know, lousy.

11:09.680 --> 11:11.113
Montezuma's revenge, bigtime.

11:11.320 --> 11:16.440
I mean, everything's going through me
like crap through a tinhorn.

11:16.680 --> 11:18.318
Better not get too close.

11:18.520 --> 11:21.353
Well, I'll take my chances.

11:29.360 --> 11:32.875
I guess you heard about
what happened down in JuÃ¡rez?

11:34.520 --> 11:36.112
Terrible.

11:37.000 --> 11:39.309
What do you expect?
Bunch of freaking animals.

11:39.520 --> 11:41.078
It's like Apocalypse Now
down there.

11:41.280 --> 11:44.955
It's like Colonel Kurtz
holed up in his jungle.

11:46.600 --> 11:49.876
And my SAC in El Paso
sends me home.

11:50.720 --> 11:54.269
Now, that's a sound leadership
decision right there, huh?

11:54.480 --> 11:57.438
You know, you don't put
your second most senior man...

11:57.640 --> 11:59.631
...on the trail
of those motherless bastards...

11:59.840 --> 12:02.229
...you send him home. You know?

12:02.720 --> 12:05.234
I was, you know--
"He's out getting an evidence bag...

12:05.440 --> 12:07.271
...and so ends up
without a scratch on him.

12:07.480 --> 12:10.836
So must be something wrong
with that picture, you know."

12:13.280 --> 12:16.113
So are you home for good then?

12:17.480 --> 12:19.471
No, no. It's....

12:19.680 --> 12:23.389
Playing it by ear. To be determined.

12:25.840 --> 12:29.469
Think you might wanna talk it through
with somebody?

12:29.680 --> 12:32.592
What, a shrink?
No, no, no. Can't go down that road.

12:32.800 --> 12:35.394
Start going down that road,
kiss your career goodbye.

12:36.280 --> 12:41.991
Or Marie. Or me, if you like.

12:48.000 --> 12:51.959
You know, I don't know
how to say this. I....

12:53.880 --> 12:55.871
You know, the things I deal with...

12:57.040 --> 13:00.157
...you and me don't have much of a--

13:00.360 --> 13:04.239
What you might call
"an experiential overlap."

13:12.160 --> 13:14.469
What if I told you we do?

13:21.680 --> 13:25.958
I have spent my whole life scared.

13:27.920 --> 13:30.912
Frightened of things
that could happen...

13:31.120 --> 13:33.350
...might happen, might not happen.

13:33.560 --> 13:36.916
Fifty years I spent like that.

13:38.640 --> 13:42.030
Finding myself awake
at 3 in the morning.

13:45.520 --> 13:47.238
But you know what?

13:48.200 --> 13:50.668
Ever since my diagnosis...

13:52.160 --> 13:54.151
...I sleep just fine.

13:59.680 --> 14:01.113
Okay.

14:01.800 --> 14:06.874
And I came to realise
it's that fear that's the worst of it.

14:07.080 --> 14:09.150
That's the real enemy.

14:11.840 --> 14:13.319
So....

14:15.480 --> 14:16.833
Get up.

14:17.280 --> 14:19.475
Get out in the real world.

14:20.080 --> 14:24.631
And you kick that bastard
as hard as you can right in the teeth.

14:39.000 --> 14:41.639
Do it again. Go on.

14:48.680 --> 14:51.478
Ten thousand even, same as last time.
It's totally accurate.

14:52.040 --> 14:53.996
You and l,
we are gonna feed this machine.

14:54.200 --> 14:57.670
-I want it running 24 hours a day.
-Right on.

15:04.800 --> 15:06.313
Not yours, I take it.

15:08.200 --> 15:13.149
We got 10, 20, 30...

15:13.360 --> 15:18.150
...44, five each.

15:20.040 --> 15:23.271
Three pounds should be 48 each.

15:23.480 --> 15:24.469
Who's short?

15:24.680 --> 15:27.319
All right. Don't freak, all right?
We didn't get ripped off.

15:27.520 --> 15:29.397
But Badger hasn't kicked in
his full amount.

15:29.600 --> 15:31.795
I know he was planning on pulling
an all-nighter...

15:32.000 --> 15:33.638
...so he's probably still in the sack.

15:33.840 --> 15:37.549
Then wake him up.
He can sleep after we're paid.

15:37.760 --> 15:40.115
Why you gotta be such a hard-on?

15:40.320 --> 15:42.709
You're not his pal. You're his boss.

15:42.920 --> 15:45.229
This only works when
they're scared of you, remember?

15:46.320 --> 15:48.390
Jack-off.

15:51.680 --> 15:53.557
It's going straight to voicemail.

15:54.480 --> 15:55.959
Voicemail?

15:56.840 --> 16:00.037
Just chill, okay? Count your money.

16:05.080 --> 16:06.274
-Combo.
-Yo, what's up?

16:06.480 --> 16:08.596
You seen Badger?

16:09.600 --> 16:11.397
Don't you cover for him, bitch.

16:11.600 --> 16:14.353
I ask you a straight-up question,
I expect a straight-up answer.

16:29.640 --> 16:30.914
Well?

16:34.880 --> 16:36.996
They were too scared to tell me.

16:38.560 --> 16:40.118
Badger got busted.

16:40.320 --> 16:42.038
He's in jail.

17:17.960 --> 17:20.190
Honey, I'm home!

17:20.400 --> 17:22.516
Too slow! What's up?

17:22.720 --> 17:24.438
Got more lives than a damn cat.

17:24.640 --> 17:26.517
Now if I could only learn
to lick myself.

17:27.520 --> 17:30.671
What's up, guys? Good to see you.
Good to see you. Good to see you.

17:30.880 --> 17:34.509
All right. Let's all get back to work,
for chrissake, okay?

17:34.720 --> 17:37.837
In my office, man. Let's see
what you bozos been up to lately.

18:00.360 --> 18:01.395
You okay?

18:01.600 --> 18:03.033
Hanging in?

18:03.240 --> 18:04.878
What's it look like?

18:05.640 --> 18:08.279
-What's this from A.P.D.?
-Been checking with them to see...

18:08.480 --> 18:10.835
...if they come across
that famous blue meth of yours.

18:11.040 --> 18:13.395
Sure enough, last night.

18:13.600 --> 18:15.909
Got themselves
an honest-to-God dealer.

18:16.120 --> 18:19.271
I was thinking of cruising over
and saying hello.

18:20.000 --> 18:21.399
Maybe you'd like to go with me?

18:22.480 --> 18:24.755
Yeah. Well, all right.

18:25.520 --> 18:27.636
You told me to my face
you weren't a cop, man.

18:28.480 --> 18:30.152
I feel manipulated.

18:30.360 --> 18:31.873
I thought we were gonna hang out.

18:32.080 --> 18:33.513
We are hanging out, Badger.

18:33.720 --> 18:35.950
You like Badger or Brandon?

18:36.760 --> 18:41.038
I like people who don't, like,
abuse the Constitution.

18:41.240 --> 18:42.355
Badger, listen.

18:42.960 --> 18:44.234
Hey.

18:44.640 --> 18:46.870
I'm trying to help you here, man.

18:47.400 --> 18:51.552
Now, if you just tell me
who your supplier is...

18:51.760 --> 18:54.558
...I think this can end
very well for you.

18:55.520 --> 18:58.592
What are you doing, detective, talking
to my client without me present?

18:58.800 --> 18:59.789
You sneaky Pete.

19:01.080 --> 19:02.354
Which is which?

19:02.560 --> 19:04.869
What, did the academy hire you
right out of the womb?

19:05.080 --> 19:06.798
You guys get younger every--

19:07.000 --> 19:08.592
What'd you say to baby face?

19:08.800 --> 19:10.153
Did you say anything stupid?

19:10.360 --> 19:12.271
By "anything stupid,"
I mean anything at all.

19:12.480 --> 19:14.835
Look at you.
Mouth open, vocal chords a-twitter.

19:15.040 --> 19:17.270
We'll talk about it later.
Right now, you out.

19:17.480 --> 19:20.597
Ten minutes ago. Go on.
There are laws, detective.

19:20.800 --> 19:22.870
Have your kindergarten teacher
read them to you.

19:23.080 --> 19:26.629
Go grab a juice box.
Have a nap. Go on.

19:30.040 --> 19:30.995
All right.

19:32.120 --> 19:33.792
Who do we have?

19:34.480 --> 19:35.629
Brandon Mayhew.

19:35.840 --> 19:38.991
Brandon Mayhew. All right.

19:39.440 --> 19:41.476
Brandon Mayhew.

19:44.320 --> 19:47.073
-Here we go. Public masturbation.
-What?

19:47.280 --> 19:50.033
I don't get it. What's the kick?
Why don't you do it at home...

19:50.240 --> 19:53.710
...with a big flat-screen TV,
50 channels of pay-per-view?

19:53.920 --> 19:56.309
In a Starbucks. That's nice.

19:56.520 --> 19:58.351
That ain't me, man. I....

19:58.560 --> 20:03.111
I was the guy who was selling meth.
Allegedly.

20:04.120 --> 20:06.031
Okay. All right. I got you.
Meth. Right.

20:06.240 --> 20:08.276
Sorry, that was a little
transpositional error.

20:08.480 --> 20:10.994
Nothing a little Wite-Out
can't take care of.

20:11.200 --> 20:13.998
Yeah, and felony quantity.

20:14.200 --> 20:16.395
-Just barely.
-Yeah, just barely.

20:16.600 --> 20:19.512
The cops are like butchers.
Always got their thumbs on the scales.

20:19.720 --> 20:21.517
But good luck arguing that in court.

20:22.920 --> 20:24.319
Let me get down to brass tacks.

20:24.520 --> 20:26.158
I'm gonna get you
a second phone call.

20:26.360 --> 20:28.271
You're gonna call
your mommy or your daddy...

20:28.480 --> 20:30.755
...or your parish priest
or your Boy Scout leader...

20:30.960 --> 20:33.952
...and they're gonna
deliver me a cheque for $4650.

20:34.160 --> 20:36.674
I'm gonna write that down
on the back of my business card.

20:36.880 --> 20:39.314
Four-six-five-zero. Okay?

20:39.520 --> 20:43.479
And I need that in a cashier's cheque
or a money order, doesn't matter.

20:43.680 --> 20:46.035
Actually, I want it in a money order.

20:46.240 --> 20:48.879
And make it out to
"lce Station Zebra Associates."

20:49.080 --> 20:51.435
That's my loan-out. It's totally legit.

20:51.640 --> 20:53.596
It's done just for tax purposes.

20:53.800 --> 20:56.234
And after that,
we can discuss Visa or MasterCard...

20:56.440 --> 21:00.149
...but definitely not American Express,
so don't even ask. All right?

21:00.360 --> 21:01.349
Any questions?

21:04.280 --> 21:06.077
You're gonna get me off, right?

21:07.120 --> 21:10.749
What do I look like, your high-school
girlfriend? Five fingers, no waiting?

21:11.360 --> 21:14.477
That's a joke, Brandon. Lighten up.

21:15.000 --> 21:18.310
Son, I promise you this.

21:18.520 --> 21:21.512
I will give you
the best criminal defence...

21:21.720 --> 21:23.039
...that money can buy.

21:24.920 --> 21:26.956
Yeah, but, Francesca,
I took these already.

21:27.160 --> 21:28.798
Didn't I take these already?

21:29.000 --> 21:31.833
It's on your head. You're not
supposed to double up on vitamin A.

21:32.040 --> 21:33.837
It's bad for the liver.

21:35.360 --> 21:37.396
Okay, who's next?

21:37.600 --> 21:39.750
Did him. I did him.

21:39.960 --> 21:42.110
That one went public defender.
Thanks for nothing.

21:42.320 --> 21:45.278
What happened to my masturbator?
You got me all turned around.

21:45.800 --> 21:47.279
Hang on. I'll get back to you.

21:48.520 --> 21:52.035
I sense you're discussing my client.
Anything you care to share with me?

21:52.240 --> 21:54.754
Sure. Your commercials?
They suck ass.

21:55.440 --> 21:57.954
I've seen better acting
in an epileptic whorehouse.

21:58.160 --> 21:59.832
Is that like the one
your mom works at?

22:00.040 --> 22:02.713
Is she still offering
the two-for-one discount?

22:02.920 --> 22:05.673
DEA, huh? For a street bust.

22:05.880 --> 22:08.872
Now, what would two feds
want with that little twerp?

22:22.400 --> 22:24.277
Sooner or later,
this was gonna happen.

22:24.480 --> 22:26.710
You want your exponential growth...

22:26.920 --> 22:28.876
...guys are gonna get busted.
Simple as that.

22:29.080 --> 22:31.878
How about we get him a real attorney?
What the hell is this?

22:32.080 --> 22:33.672
This is who he hires?

22:33.880 --> 22:36.758
What? Are you kidding me?
This is the guy you want.

22:38.120 --> 22:39.678
This is the guy I'd hire.

22:40.440 --> 22:41.759
It's the guy you'd hire.

22:41.960 --> 22:43.234
Look, you remember Emilio?

22:43.680 --> 22:46.433
Okay, this dude got Emilio off,
like, twice. Okay?

22:46.640 --> 22:50.997
Both times, they had him
dead to rights, yo. And then, poof.

22:51.200 --> 22:52.315
Dude is like Houdini.

22:52.520 --> 22:54.238
Seriously,
when the going gets tough...

22:54.440 --> 22:56.192
...you don't want a criminal lawyer.

22:56.400 --> 22:59.597
You want a "criminal" lawyer.

22:59.800 --> 23:01.518
Know what I'm saying?

23:03.040 --> 23:05.076
Look, we're in good shape,
Mr. White.

23:05.280 --> 23:07.430
Badger is way too loyal to roll.

23:07.640 --> 23:09.517
Plus, he's scared shitless of me,
all right.

23:09.720 --> 23:13.838
We pay four large. Cost of business.
Take it out of his payroll.

23:14.040 --> 23:15.712
And it's only his first dealing rap...

23:15.920 --> 23:18.388
...so, worst-case scenario,
you know, they plead him out.

23:18.600 --> 23:21.990
He does five months picking up litter
in an orange jump suit.

23:23.160 --> 23:26.948
So who goes inside?
I don't need them seeing my face.

23:27.160 --> 23:29.594
Well, I don't need them
seeing my face.

23:29.800 --> 23:32.758
Why not?
You look like his typical clientele.

23:32.960 --> 23:34.359
Dick.

23:34.560 --> 23:35.993
Fine.

23:36.560 --> 23:39.074
We'll flip for it, all right? Call it.

23:40.600 --> 23:42.158
Heads.

23:54.480 --> 23:57.677
Mayhew? Mr. Mayhew?

24:10.600 --> 24:12.875
Mr. Mayhew.

24:13.080 --> 24:15.913
Nice of you to come down. Please.

24:16.240 --> 24:17.309
Look at you.

24:17.720 --> 24:21.349
Should I call the FBl
and tell them I found D.B. Cooper?

24:21.720 --> 24:22.675
Joking.

24:22.880 --> 24:24.871
I-- Please, come on.

24:25.080 --> 24:26.798
Come on. Please.

24:27.000 --> 24:28.718
Hello.

24:29.120 --> 24:31.953
Saul Goodman. Please sit.

24:34.480 --> 24:39.110
So it's a shame that we have to meet
under these circumstances.

24:43.320 --> 24:46.153
I believe you have
something for me?

24:46.480 --> 24:48.391
Oh, yes.

24:50.920 --> 24:55.072
-Mayhew. Is that lrish or English?
-lrish.

24:55.280 --> 24:57.999
Faith and begorra.
A fellow potato-eater.

24:59.160 --> 25:00.479
My real name is McGill.

25:01.080 --> 25:02.798
The Jew thing
I just do for the homeboys.

25:03.000 --> 25:06.879
They all want a pipe-hitting member
of the tribe, so to speak.

25:07.440 --> 25:10.193
I digress.
Good things are happening.

25:10.400 --> 25:14.075
Fact is, your nephew is gonna
get out in no time.

25:14.280 --> 25:15.838
That's wonderful, yeah.

25:16.040 --> 25:18.315
There's still a few details
to be ironed out...

25:18.520 --> 25:20.397
...but now that the DEA
is involved...

25:20.840 --> 25:24.150
...I think he's looking
at time served, then probation.

25:24.360 --> 25:27.591
So leave your number with Francesca,
and we'll be in touch.

25:27.800 --> 25:29.358
-Excuse me, the DEA?
-Yeah.

25:29.560 --> 25:32.996
That's the Drug Enforcement
Administration. The feds.

25:35.640 --> 25:37.995
I hope that I'm not
the breaker of bad news...

25:38.200 --> 25:41.590
...but your nephew got mixed up
with some pretty nasty customers.

25:41.800 --> 25:42.755
I understand that.

25:42.960 --> 25:44.598
What does that have
to do with the DEA?

25:44.800 --> 25:46.233
They're after some mystery man...

25:46.440 --> 25:48.795
...some heavy-hitter
that goes by the name Heisenberg.

25:49.000 --> 25:51.309
They want this guy
like the axe wants the turkey.

25:51.520 --> 25:53.351
Seems young Brandon
may have information...

25:53.560 --> 25:55.312
...that could lead to his arrest.

25:55.840 --> 25:57.751
Jesus, cheer up.
This is good news.

25:57.960 --> 26:00.394
I mean, Brandon fell head-first
into the doo-doo pile...

26:00.600 --> 26:02.477
...and came up
smelling like Paco Rabanne.

26:03.560 --> 26:06.632
Wait, wait. Look, I just.... I think....

26:06.840 --> 26:11.755
I just think that we should
review our options.

26:11.960 --> 26:13.313
Options?

26:13.520 --> 26:15.431
I'm gonna tell you
what your options are.

26:15.640 --> 26:19.076
You got a grand total of two.
Option A: Brandon takes the deal.

26:19.280 --> 26:21.350
Option B:
Brandon goes up to the penitentiary...

26:21.560 --> 26:24.074
...and gets his rectum
resized about yay big.

26:24.280 --> 26:27.750
Look, look. What about reprisals?

26:27.960 --> 26:29.678
I mean, if Badger--

26:29.880 --> 26:35.113
If Brandon informs
on this Heisenberg....

26:35.600 --> 26:37.192
I mean, what if, God forbid...

26:37.400 --> 26:41.996
...that they decide to take revenge?

26:42.200 --> 26:43.918
What have you been telling him?

26:44.120 --> 26:47.396
The kid keeps spouting off about,
"lf I talk, they'll kill me."

26:47.600 --> 26:50.398
Right now, he's the only thing
holding up this deal.

26:51.320 --> 26:54.118
-Good.
-No, that's not good. That's terrible.

26:54.320 --> 26:57.278
Trust me, sir, your nephew
won't last in prison two weeks.

26:57.480 --> 27:00.040
You let him take his chances
on the outside.

27:00.240 --> 27:02.117
Maybe I can work
in some witness protection.

27:02.320 --> 27:05.835
No, look, look.
These are vicious, desperate people.

27:06.040 --> 27:10.795
I've been told that
one of them killed another man...

27:11.000 --> 27:14.310
...by crushing his head
with an ATM machine.

27:15.480 --> 27:17.835
People love to take credit
for the fun ones.

27:18.040 --> 27:21.350
The guy who got his head smooshed
used to be a client of mine.

27:21.560 --> 27:24.028
His wife killed him, all right?
It was open and shut.

27:24.240 --> 27:26.629
Trust me, you folks have
nothing to worry about, okay?

27:26.840 --> 27:30.037
I'm gonna set your nephew straight,
get him singing like a canary...

27:30.240 --> 27:32.549
...all's right with the world.

27:34.560 --> 27:36.596
Ten thousand dollars.

27:49.720 --> 27:52.393
Ten thousand, cash to you.

27:53.560 --> 27:57.075
I'm not saying to throw the case.

27:57.280 --> 28:02.149
Just no talking to the DEA.

28:03.160 --> 28:05.355
Are you saying
what I think you're saying?

28:06.120 --> 28:07.439
Yes.

28:08.280 --> 28:09.998
What's it going to be?

28:12.400 --> 28:14.630
What, dude wouldn't take a bribe?

28:15.040 --> 28:17.679
That dude in there?
Saul Goodman we're talking about?

28:17.880 --> 28:19.472
Yeah. "Morally outraged," he said.

28:19.680 --> 28:21.033
Threatened to call the police.

28:21.240 --> 28:25.995
-Wait, and Badger is gonna spill?
-Like the Exxon Valdez.

28:27.000 --> 28:28.991
So, what do we do about it?

28:39.240 --> 28:41.196
Hey, Francesca,
how about I follow you home?

28:41.400 --> 28:42.389
No.

28:42.600 --> 28:44.192
For safety.

28:44.400 --> 28:45.879
What?

28:47.600 --> 28:50.433
God, you are killing me
with that booty.

29:02.600 --> 29:05.034
Talk to me.
Come on, talk to me, guys, huh?

29:05.240 --> 29:08.710
Come on, just tell me what you want.
Jesus!

29:09.920 --> 29:11.911
Oh, no, no, no!

29:12.120 --> 29:14.918
No, it wasn't me.
It was lgnacio. He's the one.

29:15.120 --> 29:17.759
Oh, no. Oh, no, no, no.

29:20.520 --> 29:22.317
Shut up, dude.

29:22.760 --> 29:25.752
Shut up, all right?
Just speak English.

29:25.960 --> 29:28.713
Lalo didn't send you? No Lalo?

29:29.240 --> 29:32.312
-Who?
-Oh, thank God! Oh, Christ!

29:32.520 --> 29:34.954
Oh, I thought....

29:35.920 --> 29:37.990
What can I do for you gentlemen?

29:38.200 --> 29:40.509
Anything.
Just tell me what you need.

29:40.720 --> 29:44.633
This afternoon, an associate of ours
offered you $10,000.

29:44.840 --> 29:46.319
You should have taken it.

29:46.520 --> 29:49.478
Wait a minute.
This is in regards to what's-his-name?

29:49.680 --> 29:51.989
Badger! Brandon Mayhew.

29:52.360 --> 29:54.590
The uncle. That was your guy?

29:55.760 --> 29:58.399
No offence, but I don't take bribes
from strangers, you know?

29:58.600 --> 30:00.830
Better safe than sorry.
That's my motto.

30:01.040 --> 30:05.272
-But I'll take your money! Sure!
-No, that offer has expired, yo.

30:05.480 --> 30:09.234
It was kind of low anyways.
But okay, okay, I'll take it.

30:09.440 --> 30:11.078
Just tell me what you need,
all right?

30:11.280 --> 30:13.271
I'm easy. I'm gonna keep
a happy thought...

30:13.480 --> 30:15.675
...and assume
this is just a negotiating tactic.

30:15.880 --> 30:18.792
All right, listen to me very carefully.

30:19.000 --> 30:20.797
You are going to give
Badger Mayhew...

30:21.000 --> 30:23.992
...the best legal representation ever.

30:24.200 --> 30:26.350
But no deals with the DEA.

30:26.560 --> 30:30.075
All right? Badger will not identify
anyone to anybody.

30:30.280 --> 30:32.714
If he does, you're dead.

30:34.680 --> 30:36.955
Why don't you just kill Badger?

30:39.840 --> 30:42.513
I mean, follow me, but if a mosquito
is buzzing around you...

30:42.720 --> 30:45.792
...and it bites you on the ass,
you don't go gunning for the attorney.

30:46.000 --> 30:49.276
You go grab a fly swatter.
I mean, so to speak.

30:49.680 --> 30:52.717
I mean, all due respect,
but do I have to spell this out for you?

30:53.280 --> 30:56.192
-We're not killing Badger, yo!
-Then you got real problems, okay.

30:56.400 --> 30:58.311
Because the DEA
will come down on your boy...

30:58.520 --> 31:00.351
...Iike a proverbial ton of bricks.

31:00.560 --> 31:02.551
I don't think
I'm going out on a limb here...

31:02.760 --> 31:04.478
...but, hey,
he's not gonna like prison.

31:04.680 --> 31:08.992
He's gonna sing like Celine Dion
regardless of what you do to me.

31:14.360 --> 31:15.588
Mr. Mayhew?

31:18.200 --> 31:21.670
I recognise your cough. Take that
mask off, you know. Get some air.

31:22.040 --> 31:23.473
Go on.

31:30.360 --> 31:31.918
-God.
-Take it easy.

31:32.120 --> 31:34.634
Breathe in, breathe out.

31:34.840 --> 31:38.549
All right. I'm gonna stand up, all right?
Because I got bad knees.

31:39.280 --> 31:41.032
That's better.

31:41.760 --> 31:45.196
Okay, now listen. The three of us
are gonna work this out.

31:45.400 --> 31:46.833
Yeah? How?

31:47.080 --> 31:49.674
First thing, you'll put a dollar
in my pocket, both of you.

31:52.400 --> 31:54.470
You want attorney-client privilege,
don't you?

31:54.680 --> 31:57.592
So that everything you say
is strictly between us.

31:58.800 --> 32:00.552
I mean it. Put a dollar in my pocket.

32:00.760 --> 32:02.318
Come on, make it official.

32:03.280 --> 32:04.952
Come on, do it.

32:06.160 --> 32:08.833
That's it, come on. Just a dollar.

32:12.880 --> 32:16.395
All right, now you, ski bum.
Come on. Give with the dollar.

32:17.040 --> 32:18.029
-Go on.
-Be smart.

32:18.240 --> 32:19.639
What?

32:23.160 --> 32:24.878
-All I got is a five.
-I'll take a five.

32:25.080 --> 32:28.516
Come on, already.
Come on. Be cool.

32:30.760 --> 32:32.751
Okay, you're now both
officially represented...

32:32.960 --> 32:34.473
...by Saul Goodman and Associates.

32:34.680 --> 32:38.878
Your secrets are safe with me
under threat of disbarment. All right?

32:39.280 --> 32:42.431
Take the ski mask off. I feel like I'm
talking to the Weather Underground.

32:44.280 --> 32:46.157
Just do it.

32:50.600 --> 32:53.831
Okay, so if a prison shanking
is completely off the table....

32:54.040 --> 32:55.234
And we're sure of that?

32:57.760 --> 32:59.193
No shanking!

33:01.120 --> 33:02.553
All right, all right.

33:03.160 --> 33:07.392
The way I see it is
somebody is going to prison.

33:11.160 --> 33:12.957
It's just a matter of who.

33:14.360 --> 33:17.477
All right. Lame-ass TV ads aside...

33:17.680 --> 33:21.036
...your lawyer here,
he cooked you up a pretty killer deal.

33:21.240 --> 33:22.434
Time served, no probation.

33:22.640 --> 33:25.837
It's pretty slick.
Couldn't believe the judge went for it.

33:26.720 --> 33:28.995
Don't get cocky.
You ain't home free yet.

33:29.200 --> 33:31.156
You don't give us
the name of your supplier...

33:31.360 --> 33:34.432
-...you're going nowhere.
-The tough guy act is unnecessary.

33:34.640 --> 33:36.835
This young man
is cooperating fully.

33:37.040 --> 33:39.838
Is that right?
Yeah, you cooperating?

33:43.640 --> 33:46.393
Okay, let's start with a name.

33:48.760 --> 33:50.751
He just goes by Heisenberg.

33:51.280 --> 33:52.235
Heisenberg, huh?

33:53.560 --> 33:54.959
How old is this Heisenberg?

33:55.640 --> 33:59.269
Old. Like 50 or 70 or something.

33:59.480 --> 34:01.516
-Height?
-Average, I guess.

34:01.720 --> 34:03.517
Medium height, medium weight.

34:03.720 --> 34:06.598
-What colour hair?
-No hair.

34:06.800 --> 34:08.358
Dude is balder than you.

34:10.480 --> 34:12.835
1963, James Edward Kilkelly...

34:13.040 --> 34:15.429
...is convicted of stealing
a vending machine.

34:15.639 --> 34:18.313
1975, breaking and entering.

34:18.520 --> 34:21.034
1982, grand theft auto.

34:21.239 --> 34:23.469
1984, armed robbery.

34:23.679 --> 34:27.831
1987, 1992. You get the idea.
And here he is today.

34:28.040 --> 34:29.837
Better known as Jimmy ln-'N-Out.

34:30.040 --> 34:35.319
City, state and federal, he's spent
44 of the last 58 years inside.

34:36.280 --> 34:38.635
Entire life behind bars.

34:39.120 --> 34:41.270
Jimmy provides
a very special service.

34:41.480 --> 34:44.199
For a price,
Jimmy will go to prison for you.

34:45.159 --> 34:48.708
On purpose?
The guy goes to prison on purpose?

34:49.600 --> 34:51.431
He's actually
more comfortable inside.

34:51.639 --> 34:53.949
The outside world
hasn't been too kind to him.

34:55.920 --> 34:57.831
Sometime during
the Clinton administration...

34:58.040 --> 35:01.999
...Jimmy figured out how he could
use his talents to turn a profit.

35:06.320 --> 35:10.916
-So when does all this happen?
-It's already happening.

35:11.120 --> 35:12.348
The buy is set for tomorrow.

35:12.560 --> 35:15.120
Cops bust Jimmy, Badger gets out,
everybody's happy...

35:15.320 --> 35:18.198
...and all it's gonna cost you
is 80 thousand and one pound...

35:18.400 --> 35:19.833
...of your finest meth.

35:24.280 --> 35:27.955
Eighty thousand dollars
for eight years of his life, huh?

35:28.160 --> 35:30.276
First of all,
he's not gonna do eight years.

35:30.480 --> 35:32.198
I'll represent him, and I guarantee...

35:32.400 --> 35:35.756
...there's gonna be some unexpected
problems with the prosecution's case.

35:35.960 --> 35:38.474
Secondly, he gets 30.
Fifty goes to me.

35:38.680 --> 35:41.592
-You get 50? For what?
-For facilitating.

35:41.800 --> 35:44.360
Who's taking a bigger risk here?
He likes prison.

35:44.560 --> 35:46.471
You did bring the cash, didn't you?

35:46.680 --> 35:49.638
Look, if this option
is too expensive...

35:49.840 --> 35:53.116
...you can still always...Badger
in the chow line.

36:10.680 --> 36:12.671
Conscience gets expensive,
doesn't it?

36:29.400 --> 36:31.789
All right. There's our boy.

36:32.920 --> 36:35.115
Right on time.

36:51.120 --> 36:53.998
-Go back.
-What? All right, all right, all right.

37:06.360 --> 37:09.830
So, what do you think?
They see us?

37:10.240 --> 37:12.037
No, man, I think we're good.

37:17.240 --> 37:19.231
Badger looks like
he's gonna throw up.

37:19.640 --> 37:21.039
Give me those back.

37:21.240 --> 37:23.117
Just give them to me.

37:23.760 --> 37:25.478
Oh, no.

37:26.040 --> 37:27.189
Where the hell is Jimmy?

37:27.400 --> 37:29.311
Should've been here
10 minutes ago.

37:29.520 --> 37:34.036
You think Jimmy is actually for real?
A guy who wants to be in prison?

37:34.600 --> 37:36.511
There's more
than one kind of prison.

37:36.720 --> 37:38.472
What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

37:38.680 --> 37:41.035
There he is-- Wait a minute.

37:41.240 --> 37:44.630
-Oh, no, no, no.
-What? What? Let me see.

37:46.120 --> 37:48.236
-Who the hell is that?
-I don't know.

37:51.800 --> 37:54.633
Mr. Heisenberg, I presume.

37:55.640 --> 37:57.232
Time to move?

37:57.520 --> 37:59.476
Not till we see the exchange.

38:02.200 --> 38:05.078
No, no. Oh, shit!

38:05.280 --> 38:08.238
-What?
-Now he shows.

38:11.600 --> 38:13.431
Okay, let's do this.

38:17.440 --> 38:18.714
No, no.

38:18.920 --> 38:21.354
Oh, my God.
Jimmy is on the wrong bench. Crap!

38:21.560 --> 38:23.551
We're screwed!

38:23.760 --> 38:25.079
What are you doing?

38:25.280 --> 38:27.316
Hey, what are you doing?

38:31.240 --> 38:33.037
I don't get it. What's the holdup?

38:43.320 --> 38:44.548
Where's the stuff, man?

38:44.760 --> 38:46.796
-Where are we going?
-Just shut up.

38:52.440 --> 38:53.589
Get out. Go stop him.

38:53.800 --> 38:56.109
The DEA is right there.
If they see me, we're screwed.

38:56.320 --> 38:57.753
Get out. I'll do something.

38:57.960 --> 38:59.871
-What?
-Just go!

39:12.280 --> 39:14.316
Hank, I thought that was you.

39:14.520 --> 39:16.033
Schrader, I'm blocked.

39:16.240 --> 39:18.879
-Walt, not a good time.
-How you doing? You feeling okay?

39:19.080 --> 39:20.035
Schrader, I'm blocked.

39:20.720 --> 39:22.631
We're working.
You gotta get out of here.

39:22.840 --> 39:26.037
-Working? Oh, like DEA working?
-Schrader, we're missing it. Schrader.

39:26.240 --> 39:28.196
Is something going down?

39:30.360 --> 39:32.794
Wrong guy, wrong guy.
Other bench.

39:39.320 --> 39:40.389
Walt, Walt.

39:40.600 --> 39:42.636
-Walter, move your ass now.
-Okay.

39:42.840 --> 39:44.558
Listen, I'll just go, leave you alone.

39:44.760 --> 39:47.433
-We'll talk about it later. Just floor it.
-Should I back up?

39:47.640 --> 39:48.993
-Go that way.
-Forward is better?

39:49.200 --> 39:50.952
I'll be out of the way there.
Okay, okay.

39:51.160 --> 39:53.515
I'm sorry, all right? I'm sorry.

39:53.720 --> 39:56.188
-I'll leave you alone.
-We'll talk later. Just go.

39:56.920 --> 39:59.673
Where'd he go?
Where the hell did he go?

40:01.560 --> 40:04.677
Oh, wait. Wait, wait, wait. Got him.

40:11.640 --> 40:13.915
-Looks like it's going down.
-Take him.

40:21.600 --> 40:24.478
Freeze! Hey, right there.
Don't move.

40:26.800 --> 40:28.153
Come on, let's get him up.

40:37.560 --> 40:39.152
Jesus!

40:40.120 --> 40:41.872
I think they bought it.

40:45.480 --> 40:46.469
Absolutely.

40:46.680 --> 40:49.911
Textbook bust, sir. Yes, sir.

40:50.120 --> 40:52.554
Looks like we got a full pound
of the blue stuff.

40:52.760 --> 40:57.311
Oh, and Heisenberg's real name?
James Kilkelly.

40:58.560 --> 41:02.473
Thank you. Thank you very much.
It was my pleasure.

41:28.120 --> 41:29.394
Hey.

41:30.360 --> 41:32.749
You weren't home,
so I let the delivery guys in.

41:32.960 --> 41:36.236
-I hope that's okay.
-Absolutely.

41:45.240 --> 41:47.310
So you bought a bed.

41:48.720 --> 41:49.789
Yeah.

41:50.360 --> 41:51.998
What is that, a king?

41:54.400 --> 41:55.913
Pillow top?

42:30.640 --> 42:34.394
Oh, my God.
You really are a chemistry teacher.

42:39.160 --> 42:40.593
You mind?

42:44.520 --> 42:46.636
I was terrible at chemistry.

42:46.840 --> 42:49.354
I'm more of a humanities guy.

42:49.560 --> 42:52.028
-How did you find me?
-We should talk about that.

42:52.240 --> 42:56.392
It should be much, much harder
for people to track you down.

42:56.600 --> 42:58.158
My Pl charged me for three hours...

42:58.360 --> 43:01.193
...so I seriously doubt
it took him more than one.

43:04.000 --> 43:06.992
So this is, what, blackmail?

43:07.200 --> 43:08.838
Walter, I'm your lawyer.

43:09.040 --> 43:13.272
Anything you say to me
is totally privileged.

43:13.480 --> 43:15.914
I'm not in the shakedown racket.

43:16.120 --> 43:18.429
I'm a lawyer. Even drug dealers
need lawyers, right?

43:18.640 --> 43:21.632
Especially drug dealers.

43:22.040 --> 43:25.919
So, what, you're just doing this
out of the kindness of your heart?

43:26.440 --> 43:29.591
Come on.
Have you seen my hourly rate?

43:30.840 --> 43:32.717
By the way,
where do you keep the money?

43:32.920 --> 43:37.038
Is it in your mattress? Is it in a jelly jar
buried in the side yard?

43:37.240 --> 43:40.073
This kid Mayhew may be the first
of your guys to get picked up...

43:40.280 --> 43:41.508
...but he won't be the last.

43:41.720 --> 43:45.110
And if I can find you,
how far behind can the cops be?

43:45.320 --> 43:46.673
I don't understand.

43:46.880 --> 43:49.633
What exactly are you
offering to do for me?

43:51.080 --> 43:53.992
What did Tom Hagen
do for Vito Corleone?

43:54.400 --> 43:57.358
I'm no Vito Corleone.

43:57.560 --> 44:00.199
No shit. Right now, you're Fredo.

44:00.400 --> 44:01.833
But with some sound advice...

44:02.040 --> 44:04.315
...and the proper introductions,
who knows?

44:04.520 --> 44:06.397
I'll tell you,
you've got the right product.

44:06.600 --> 44:09.239
Anything that gets the DEA's panties
in this big a bunch...

44:09.440 --> 44:11.032
...you're on to something special.

44:11.240 --> 44:15.438
And I would like to be
a small and silent part of it.
