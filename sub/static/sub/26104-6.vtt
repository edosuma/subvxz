00:01.635 --> 00:04.338
ANNOUNCER: FX presents Mayans.

00:09.009 --> 00:10.478
- Previously on
"Mayans M.C."...

00:10.511 --> 00:11.645
- I talked to Devante Cano
this morning.

00:11.679 --> 00:12.913
He gave me this.

00:12.946 --> 00:14.482
- We'll keep our eyes open.

00:14.515 --> 00:16.184
- But for now only
the eyes in this room

00:16.217 --> 00:18.486
until you're convinced
your charter is Judas-free.

00:19.720 --> 00:21.289
- He got a call,
seemed upset.

00:21.322 --> 00:23.124
I saw him yesterday--
Olympic Diner.

00:23.157 --> 00:25.859
He was arguing with a woman
and he chased after her.

00:25.893 --> 00:27.361
- Just drive.

00:27.395 --> 00:28.496
- Leticia!

00:28.529 --> 00:30.864
- We did some very bad things

00:30.898 --> 00:33.101
for some very bad people.

00:33.134 --> 00:35.069
Don't fuck with my family,

00:35.103 --> 00:38.772
or I'll ruin you
and everything you love.

00:47.381 --> 00:49.650
- He came through.

00:49.683 --> 00:51.185
- Why does Adelita
need all this cash?

00:51.219 --> 00:53.053
- Next phase of the plan.

00:53.087 --> 00:55.489
- I just get a little
piece at a time.

00:56.457 --> 00:59.093
- Don't do this again.

01:49.977 --> 01:51.279
- Hey.

01:51.312 --> 01:53.447
Quit drooling on the
fucking money.

01:57.551 --> 01:59.052
- My bad.

01:59.086 --> 02:01.955
- Adelita's picture's
gotta be everywhere.

02:03.591 --> 02:05.893
She stays on the border.

02:07.361 --> 02:08.896
It's just a matter of time.

02:08.929 --> 02:10.764
- She won't get caught.
She's smart.

02:10.798 --> 02:12.099
- If she doesn't tell
you anything,

02:12.132 --> 02:14.402
how do you know she's smart?

03:07.221 --> 03:08.188
The money?

03:08.222 --> 03:09.823
- Yeah.

03:09.857 --> 03:11.792
The mercs gave us half now.

03:11.825 --> 03:13.861
Half when they unload
the 6 keys.

03:15.696 --> 03:17.865
We need to talk.

03:17.898 --> 03:20.334
Alone.

03:20.368 --> 03:22.836
- Inside.

03:47.428 --> 03:48.662
What is it?

03:48.696 --> 03:49.930
- Look...

03:49.963 --> 03:51.399
I get it.

03:51.432 --> 03:55.503
You got a hundred suppliers
depending on you.

03:55.536 --> 03:57.638
But I'm in this up to
my fucking eyeballs,

03:57.671 --> 04:01.375
and my own guys are
starting to doubt me.

04:01.409 --> 04:03.311
And what we're doing here...

04:03.344 --> 04:05.245
if you don't trust me
by now, Adelita,

04:05.279 --> 04:07.014
you never will.

04:07.047 --> 04:09.317
And then we're fucked.

04:10.651 --> 04:12.886
I need to know everything.

04:12.920 --> 04:15.222
Soup and nuts.

04:21.161 --> 04:23.764
It's a saying.

04:23.797 --> 04:25.699
I need to know the plan.

04:25.733 --> 04:28.936
For Galindo, the heroin.

04:28.969 --> 04:32.640
I got in this to protect my MC.
I can't do that in the dark.

04:37.077 --> 04:41.349
- My real name...

04:41.382 --> 04:44.518
is Luisa Espina.

04:44.552 --> 04:46.587
And there are not
hundreds of people

04:46.620 --> 04:49.690
depending on me.

04:49.723 --> 04:51.725
There are thousands.

04:54.161 --> 04:55.563
Sit.

04:58.532 --> 05:01.301
I'll tell you everything.

05:05.773 --> 05:12.780
*

05:14.348 --> 05:17.585
- * Mother of exiles

05:17.618 --> 05:19.587
* The torch of hope

05:19.620 --> 05:22.356
* In the toss of the tempest

05:22.390 --> 05:25.158
* Threw us medicine's rope

05:25.192 --> 05:28.596
* But the brazen giant

05:28.629 --> 05:30.498
* Within the stride

05:30.531 --> 05:33.467
* Blocks the golden door

05:33.501 --> 05:36.169
* To the US of lies

05:36.203 --> 05:37.471
* Screaming

05:37.505 --> 05:41.642
* Damn your huddled masses

05:41.675 --> 05:44.412
* Scrub our floors

05:44.445 --> 05:46.847
* Cut our grasses

05:46.880 --> 05:49.550
* I am a wolf

05:49.583 --> 05:52.420
* A wild cur

05:52.453 --> 05:55.656
* Cut from the pack

05:55.689 --> 05:58.291
* With blood on my fur

05:58.325 --> 06:00.994
* Every howl

06:01.028 --> 06:03.764
* Marks the dead

06:03.797 --> 06:07.134
* 'Cause a beaten dog

06:07.167 --> 06:08.802
*

06:08.836 --> 06:11.204
* Never forgets

06:11.238 --> 06:14.174
*

06:14.207 --> 06:16.209
* Never forgets

06:16.243 --> 06:22.249
*

06:33.427 --> 06:38.866
*

06:38.899 --> 06:40.801
- Just heard from Taza and Riz.

06:40.834 --> 06:42.202
Made it to Vegas.

06:42.235 --> 06:44.404
Chinese have their product.

06:44.438 --> 06:46.206
- About time.

06:46.239 --> 06:48.408
How many guys did
Galindo throw on it?

06:48.442 --> 06:50.844
- He matched us, four to four.

06:50.878 --> 06:53.947
Taza said there were no bumps.

06:53.981 --> 06:55.082
- Hey.

06:55.115 --> 06:57.618
A moment, sweetheart?

07:04.424 --> 07:06.093
What's your hit on that?

07:06.126 --> 07:08.896
Splitting protection
with Galindo?

07:08.929 --> 07:11.231
- Well, if we can make
it work, it's smart.

07:11.264 --> 07:13.066
Keeps the protection
money coming in.

07:13.100 --> 07:15.402
Galindo shares half the risk.

07:15.435 --> 07:17.738
We don't take the hit
if shit goes sideways.

07:21.241 --> 07:22.943
- He knows.

07:22.976 --> 07:24.444
- Good.

07:27.214 --> 07:30.450
We'll keep Angel and Coco
close a couple more weeks,

07:30.484 --> 07:33.587
prove to Alvarez there's no
fucking mole at our table.

07:33.621 --> 07:35.756
Put all that noise to bed.

07:35.789 --> 07:37.591
- I'll take Coco with me.

07:37.625 --> 07:40.528
Gotta bid on that
copper pool in Brawley.

07:40.561 --> 07:42.029
- Benny's getting
a lot of heat

07:42.062 --> 07:44.965
from the families of our
missing militia.

07:44.998 --> 07:47.935
Gonna go reassure her
that the, uh,

07:47.968 --> 07:50.070
redneck closets
are skeleton-free.

07:50.103 --> 07:51.639
- Yeah.

07:51.672 --> 07:54.508
Just tell them they joined
a mariachi band

07:54.542 --> 07:56.309
and moved to Mexico.

07:56.343 --> 07:58.378
- Forever.

08:04.351 --> 08:06.787
- Stay close, mi amor.

08:17.998 --> 08:19.867
- Don't worry.

08:19.900 --> 08:21.501
I'm off the clock.

08:26.607 --> 08:29.309
- Breakfast of champions.

08:29.342 --> 08:31.378
- We are the champions...

08:31.411 --> 08:33.380
are we not?

08:46.426 --> 08:49.096
- I had some vacation days.

08:49.129 --> 08:53.066
Took my wife and kids
to her sister's house up north.

08:54.067 --> 08:57.070
Tried to trim the shrubs
on the back porch...

08:57.104 --> 08:58.672
Trimmers...

08:58.706 --> 09:02.009
How the fuck do you
sharpen those blades?

09:02.042 --> 09:04.011
Maybe you don't.

09:06.113 --> 09:08.215
- I'm gonna go put on
some coffee.

09:11.551 --> 09:13.921
- Would you really hurt
my wife and kids?

09:18.091 --> 09:21.528
- I don't underestimate
any man's capacity

09:21.561 --> 09:23.897
for despicable acts.

09:23.931 --> 09:28.001
- Kinda hoping for,
like, a yes or no.

09:28.035 --> 09:29.603
Something a little simpler.

09:29.637 --> 09:32.572
- Then you're fucked.

09:33.841 --> 09:35.776
- Wow.

09:46.553 --> 09:48.121
- Yeah.

09:50.791 --> 09:53.160
I don't think there
would be any legal issue

09:53.193 --> 09:56.196
if we pulled out
of the Santo Padre deal.

09:56.229 --> 09:59.733
County might ask us
to cover some admin expenses.

10:01.101 --> 10:03.637
But looking through
all of these...

10:03.671 --> 10:05.906
PeÃ±a had to bend
a lot of rules

10:05.939 --> 10:07.775
to push this deal through.

10:07.808 --> 10:09.409
If we burn her on this,

10:09.442 --> 10:10.944
can't she make life
difficult...

10:10.978 --> 10:12.579
for other interests?

10:12.612 --> 10:14.214
- She won't.

10:14.247 --> 10:17.250
She can't risk losing
more of our business.

10:17.284 --> 10:19.086
I employ nearly 20%
of Santo Padre.

10:19.119 --> 10:20.721
Good morning, my love.

10:20.754 --> 10:21.755
- Morning.

10:28.428 --> 10:30.898
Permiso.

10:30.931 --> 10:32.700
Bueno?

10:47.314 --> 10:50.450
She hates that
I'm doing this.

10:50.483 --> 10:52.152
- She doesn't understand.

10:52.185 --> 10:55.388
In her day,
wives weren't lawyers.

10:55.422 --> 10:56.890
They just...

10:56.924 --> 11:00.393
- They just...
took care of the children.

11:20.347 --> 11:22.215
- Dos.

12:33.987 --> 12:36.356
- There's someone here
to see you.

12:36.389 --> 12:38.125
Says she's family.

12:39.226 --> 12:40.293
- 'Kay.

12:44.631 --> 12:45.899
- Hey.

12:45.933 --> 12:47.700
You okay?

12:47.734 --> 12:49.769
- Not really.

12:52.906 --> 12:54.707
Who are you?

12:55.708 --> 12:57.610
- This is Leti.

12:57.644 --> 12:59.913
She's my kid.

13:05.052 --> 13:08.255
- Bishop and Hank.
Looking for you.

13:09.256 --> 13:11.158
- Give me a minute.

13:15.829 --> 13:17.764
It's a long,
fucked up story.

13:17.797 --> 13:19.632
- Can't wait to hear it.

13:22.369 --> 13:23.803
- Jefe.

13:23.837 --> 13:25.572
- We got business, hermano.

13:25.605 --> 13:27.707
I'll fill you in on the way.

13:28.909 --> 13:29.910
Okay.

13:29.943 --> 13:31.411
- You're with me, Slick.

13:31.444 --> 13:33.613
I need you on that
copper bid in Brawley.

13:33.646 --> 13:35.949
- I mean, Taza knows copper
way better than I do.

13:35.983 --> 13:37.450
- Yeah, well,
he's in Vegas, so, uh,

13:37.484 --> 13:38.651
you'll do.

13:40.287 --> 13:42.355
- He's got a yard shift.

13:43.423 --> 13:45.758
- All right.

13:45.792 --> 13:47.227
Watch her, boy scout.

13:47.260 --> 13:48.996
You make sure she doesn't
go anywhere, huh?

13:49.029 --> 13:51.031
- Yeah, of course.

14:08.815 --> 14:11.318
- Coco had some club business.

14:11.351 --> 14:13.186
He'll be back
in a couple hours.

14:13.220 --> 14:15.122
You can wait here--
- I can't wait.

14:15.155 --> 14:16.990
He just left?
- Had no choice.

14:17.024 --> 14:19.126
Bullshit.
- Hey, hey.

14:19.159 --> 14:20.560
Where you going?

14:21.828 --> 14:23.130
- She seems troubled.

14:23.163 --> 14:26.333
- I'll keep that
in mind, Chucky.

14:26.366 --> 14:27.434
Hey!

14:28.701 --> 14:31.138
Hold on. Your dad wants you
to stick around.

14:31.171 --> 14:33.140
- Shit, that sounds weird.

14:33.173 --> 14:34.707
He's only been my dad
for, like, a week.

14:36.243 --> 14:39.179
- I've only known him
for a week.

14:39.212 --> 14:41.048
- Oh.

14:47.854 --> 14:49.422
What's your name?

14:49.456 --> 14:51.358
- EZ.
Ezekiel.

14:51.391 --> 14:52.993
- Mm. Like from the Bible.

14:53.026 --> 14:54.727
- And other places.

14:54.761 --> 14:56.363
What's going on, Leti?

14:59.766 --> 15:02.169
Shit.

15:03.770 --> 15:06.773
Who did this?

15:11.778 --> 15:13.580
Fuck!

15:17.817 --> 15:19.719
Who the fuck is that?

15:19.752 --> 15:21.154
- Albert.

15:22.122 --> 15:25.258
- Doesn't really paint
the whole picture for me.

15:25.292 --> 15:26.593
- He gave me a ride.

15:26.626 --> 15:28.595
He seemed nice.
We hung out a few days.

15:28.628 --> 15:30.930
Last night we partied,
and he fell asleep.

15:30.964 --> 15:33.266
I was just taking 10 bucks
to get something to eat.

15:33.300 --> 15:35.435
- He thought you
were rolling him.

15:39.973 --> 15:41.241
- Okay.

15:44.477 --> 15:45.945
- In his truck.

15:45.979 --> 15:47.880
Rest stop off of 98.

15:47.914 --> 15:49.582
Nobody saw anything.

15:51.351 --> 15:52.419
- Celia's.

15:52.452 --> 15:54.087
My grandmother.

15:57.690 --> 15:59.592
- Get in.

16:00.627 --> 16:02.729
And put your shirt on.

16:08.401 --> 16:10.703
We gotta clean shit up.

16:12.172 --> 16:13.906
Start with the truck.

16:13.940 --> 16:16.576
Get rid of any trace of you.

16:16.609 --> 16:18.245
Then put Albert back

16:18.278 --> 16:20.113
and make it look like
someone tried to jack him.

16:20.147 --> 16:22.249
- That makes sense.

16:22.282 --> 16:24.617
You're really smart.

16:24.651 --> 16:26.186
- Yet, I'm here.

16:27.920 --> 16:29.856
- You can fuck me
if you want.

16:37.630 --> 16:40.233
- I'm just trying to help you.

16:41.968 --> 16:44.637
I don't want anything
from you.

17:00.053 --> 17:01.488
- Thanks.

17:03.556 --> 17:06.226
You should probably
be at your shop.

17:08.561 --> 17:10.997
- I called my weekend guy.

17:11.030 --> 17:13.233
He's got it covered.

17:15.702 --> 17:17.837
- That stuff you
showed me, the...

17:17.870 --> 17:21.341
birth certificates
and the pictures.

17:21.374 --> 17:23.643
- It's real.

17:25.845 --> 17:28.781
- '76 through '84.

17:28.815 --> 17:31.017
- Jesus.

17:31.050 --> 17:32.819
How'd you get out?

17:32.852 --> 17:35.522
- Same way I survived.

17:35.555 --> 17:37.957
Blood and money.

17:40.927 --> 17:45.064
The woman I loved was pregnant
with our first son.

17:45.098 --> 17:47.234
- Angel.

17:57.910 --> 17:59.879
Sorry for showing up like this.

17:59.912 --> 18:03.416
I've, uh...

18:03.450 --> 18:05.885
been on a bit of a run.

18:05.918 --> 18:07.954
- I can see that.

18:10.657 --> 18:15.061
- Threatening your family
was a fucked up thing to do.

18:15.094 --> 18:16.629
- Yeah.

18:16.663 --> 18:18.731
For both of us.

18:20.433 --> 18:22.669
- EZ was just a kid.

18:22.702 --> 18:25.838
Made a stupid mistake.

18:25.872 --> 18:28.641
Making this deal was
the right thing to do.

18:28.675 --> 18:31.077
I knew there'd be risks.

18:31.110 --> 18:33.613
Always are.

18:33.646 --> 18:36.783
But the pieces fit.

18:36.816 --> 18:39.386
Get him close to the action,

18:39.419 --> 18:41.454
his memory for detail--

18:41.488 --> 18:44.090
in a year or two, we'd have
a fucking book on Galindo.

18:44.123 --> 18:46.593
- Then why are you
unraveling it?

18:46.626 --> 18:48.261
- Not me.

18:48.295 --> 18:50.263
My sack is getting pressed
by the U.S. Attorneys.

18:50.297 --> 18:52.064
They need something
to leverage against Galindo

18:52.098 --> 18:54.734
and they need it now.

18:54.767 --> 18:56.969
Why...

18:57.003 --> 18:59.071
is above my pay grade.

18:59.105 --> 19:02.108
I don't know
how high up it goes.

19:02.141 --> 19:04.644
- EZ isn't gonna press Emily.

19:04.677 --> 19:07.480
He wasn't bluffing.

19:07.514 --> 19:11.284
He'll face a yard of shivs

19:11.318 --> 19:14.754
before he'd risk
hurting her again.

19:14.787 --> 19:16.723
- And if that happens,
neither one of us

19:16.756 --> 19:18.925
is
gonna be able to protect him.

19:24.163 --> 19:26.233
- Got a call from our kid

19:26.266 --> 19:29.135
inside the rebel camp.
Gave us their new location.

19:29.168 --> 19:30.970
So we need to move now,
before they ghost again.

19:32.372 --> 19:34.707
- Yeah. They're getting bold.

19:38.478 --> 19:40.179
They're in the
industrial quarter

19:40.213 --> 19:42.449
on the edge of downtown.
- That's so close.

19:42.482 --> 19:45.117
- We just got a call
on the service line.

19:45.151 --> 19:46.986
She wants to talk to you.

19:47.019 --> 19:50.557
She says her name is Adelita.

21:20.112 --> 21:21.748
- Prep the money.

21:23.450 --> 21:25.652
- I want to have my
son in my arms.

21:25.685 --> 21:28.555
You hit that location.

21:28.588 --> 21:30.690
Slaughter every fucking
one of them.

21:39.899 --> 21:41.734
- Come, Dita.

22:04.023 --> 22:05.492
- Truck's around the corner.

22:05.525 --> 22:07.560
Past those rigs.

22:10.196 --> 22:12.965
- How'd you get him
in the trunk?

22:12.999 --> 22:15.602
- It was dark. I...

22:15.635 --> 22:18.505
backed up the car,
pushed him out of the cab.

22:20.139 --> 22:22.842
I'm stronger than I look.

22:38.224 --> 22:40.026
- Shit!

22:46.098 --> 22:48.167
Hey, Mom?
Pop?

22:49.436 --> 22:50.470
Mom!

22:52.839 --> 22:54.841
Mom? Help!

22:54.874 --> 22:56.375
- Help!

22:59.178 --> 23:01.180
- I'm here.

23:06.953 --> 23:08.521
- It's the big silver one.

23:08.555 --> 23:10.590
Keys are inside.

23:14.026 --> 23:15.462
- Okay.

23:17.096 --> 23:18.731
Get back to the car.

23:18.765 --> 23:20.199
I'll check it out,
then bring it around.

23:20.232 --> 23:22.902
We'll do the rest after dark.
- Okay.

23:47.393 --> 23:49.061
- Hey.

23:49.095 --> 23:51.931
That ain't your truck, Jose.

23:51.964 --> 23:54.734
- I'm just taking it to Albert.
I'm a friend.

23:54.767 --> 23:57.537
- Why don't you get out
of the truck, friend?

24:02.141 --> 24:03.876
Tell me who the fuck you are.

24:03.910 --> 24:05.945
- Well, apparently I'm Jose.

24:07.046 --> 24:08.681
- Fuck off.

24:18.457 --> 24:19.659
- Aah!

24:26.465 --> 24:29.569
- What the fuck is it
with you and screwdrivers?

24:44.751 --> 24:47.654
- I didn't kill him.

24:47.687 --> 24:50.557
- Sorry if I don't
see that as a win.

24:51.758 --> 24:54.694
- Shouldn't let them
kick the shit out of you.

24:58.197 --> 25:01.534
- I know you did it
to help me.

25:01.568 --> 25:02.835
- Whatever.

25:09.375 --> 25:11.277
- I'm with Coco's kid.

25:11.310 --> 25:13.079
It's not good.

25:13.112 --> 25:15.447
Where's Coco?
- Still with Hank.

25:15.481 --> 25:17.483
- Meet me at the pit.
- All right.

25:17.516 --> 25:19.451
I'll meet you there.

25:28.460 --> 25:29.962
- Her prints
are in that truck?

25:29.996 --> 25:32.732
- Yeah.
Mine too, now.

25:32.765 --> 25:34.801
Doubt the two half-brains
who jumped me

25:34.834 --> 25:36.468
are gonna be a problem.

25:36.502 --> 25:39.205
Not the kind of guys
who want cops asking questions.

25:40.539 --> 25:43.209
- We gotta get rid of him
and that truck.

25:45.077 --> 25:46.746
- Yeah.

25:46.779 --> 25:48.981
Park the car at the
warehouse for now.

25:49.015 --> 25:51.183
Wait till dark to make
this shit go away.

25:53.586 --> 25:55.521
She okay?

25:55.554 --> 25:58.557
- I think so.

25:58.591 --> 26:00.026
You mind taking her?

26:00.059 --> 26:01.694
I need a break.

26:01.728 --> 26:05.531
- Yeah. I'll drop her off
at the yard...

26:05.564 --> 26:07.767
Come back and get you.

26:27.553 --> 26:29.656
- Oh, shit.

26:33.960 --> 26:35.662
- Oh, shit.

26:35.695 --> 26:37.396
- Tags current
on Grandma's car?

26:37.429 --> 26:41.734
- I don't think that's why
he's getting pulled over.

26:47.874 --> 26:49.642
- She stole the fucking car
from Grandma.

26:49.676 --> 26:51.410
P.D.'s looking for a felon.

26:51.443 --> 26:52.679
- Of course she did.

26:52.712 --> 26:54.013
Fuck.

27:01.520 --> 27:03.022
- Dispatch,
this is

27:03.055 --> 27:04.356
requesting backup
on a stolen--

27:04.390 --> 27:06.058
Hey, hey!

27:08.695 --> 27:10.096
- My bad.

28:01.047 --> 28:08.054
*

28:24.403 --> 28:31.410
*

29:57.296 --> 29:59.198
- I love you.

29:59.231 --> 30:01.000
- I love you too.

30:03.635 --> 30:05.938
- Be back soon.
- Okay.

30:17.449 --> 30:18.584
Bueno.

30:39.571 --> 30:46.612
*

31:13.439 --> 31:20.479
*

31:25.684 --> 31:27.719
- How you feeling,
Boy Scout?

31:27.753 --> 31:30.889
- Little wet.
Little tired.

31:30.923 --> 31:33.325
Sorry about how this
all went down.

31:33.359 --> 31:34.961
- It's okay, man.

31:34.994 --> 31:37.329
I see that you did it
for me.

31:37.363 --> 31:39.698
My family.

31:39.731 --> 31:42.001
I wouldn't expect that
from anyone,

31:42.034 --> 31:44.570
the table or otherwise.

31:44.603 --> 31:46.939
Thank you, EZ.

31:49.976 --> 31:52.378
- Yeah, no worries.

31:53.912 --> 31:56.648
Can I ask you something?

31:58.784 --> 32:02.721
Why'd she just find out
that you're her dad?

32:02.754 --> 32:05.391
- I never knew you
had another kid.

32:05.424 --> 32:07.926
- I don't know.

32:07.960 --> 32:10.362
Shame, I guess.

32:10.396 --> 32:12.564
Pride.

32:12.598 --> 32:15.234
See, my family tree,
it's like...

32:15.267 --> 32:18.404
it's like this invasive,
blood-sucking weed

32:18.437 --> 32:22.074
that drains the life out of
every fucking thing it touches.

32:22.108 --> 32:25.144
Gotta keep it away
from the things I love.

32:29.948 --> 32:33.085
- She's inside.

32:44.430 --> 32:46.198
- Come on, let's get a drink.

32:46.232 --> 32:49.401
- I'll be there in a minute.

32:51.437 --> 32:53.339
- Proud of you.

33:00.079 --> 33:01.747
- A kitten can be overwhelmed

33:01.780 --> 33:03.915
by all the new stimuli
of spring,

33:03.949 --> 33:05.951
but gradually,
it follows the lead of--

33:09.021 --> 33:10.989
- She's in the bathroom.

33:11.023 --> 33:12.391
- Yeah.

33:12.424 --> 33:14.893
Hey, Chucky, I-I'm...

33:14.926 --> 33:16.595
I'm not sure what
you heard or...

33:16.628 --> 33:17.929
what you know about her...

33:17.963 --> 33:19.998
- She's family.

33:20.032 --> 33:22.068
- Yeah, she is.

33:22.101 --> 33:23.135
You know, the club doesn't
need to know

33:23.169 --> 33:25.304
about any of this right now.

33:25.337 --> 33:27.005
We gotta sort some shit out.

33:27.039 --> 33:28.307
- 'Course.

33:28.340 --> 33:31.277
Family's important.

33:31.310 --> 33:32.978
And I would like that someday.

33:33.011 --> 33:34.580
Family shit.

33:34.613 --> 33:36.248
To sort out.

33:36.282 --> 33:39.151
I enjoy you, Coco.

33:41.387 --> 33:43.322
- Give us a minute.

33:43.355 --> 33:45.057
- The minute

33:45.091 --> 33:47.993
and all the precious
minutes that follow

33:48.026 --> 33:50.196
belong to you...

33:50.229 --> 33:52.030
and yours.

34:00.172 --> 34:01.173
- I don't know.

34:01.207 --> 34:03.309
Won him in a card game.

34:03.342 --> 34:06.878
I'm not kidding.

34:06.912 --> 34:08.580
Sit.

34:21.026 --> 34:22.628
- I'm sorry I fucked things up.

34:22.661 --> 34:24.263
- Ah...

34:24.296 --> 34:26.898
Shit got a little
out of control.

34:28.500 --> 34:30.469
But I guess that's on me.

34:32.070 --> 34:34.340
You know, I got two other kids.

34:34.373 --> 34:36.742
Two different moms, and...

34:36.775 --> 34:39.478
there's a reason why
I'm not in their lives.

34:39.511 --> 34:41.847
It's better for everyone.

34:43.349 --> 34:44.516
You see everything I did,

34:44.550 --> 34:47.353
no matter how fucked up
it was...

34:47.386 --> 34:49.788
I did it 'cause I thought
it was the best thing for you.

34:53.292 --> 34:56.428
Man, maybe it's some bullshit,
I don't know.

35:00.166 --> 35:02.801
I'm sorry, Leticia.

35:08.474 --> 35:10.609
- I don't need you
to be my dad.

35:13.612 --> 35:17.082
When--when I knew we were
moving back here, I...

35:17.115 --> 35:21.119
I was just excited to know
I had a brother.

35:21.153 --> 35:23.789
I'm tired of having no one.
Ha.

35:28.327 --> 35:31.330
- I'll make you a deal,
all right?

35:31.363 --> 35:33.765
Whatever this is, you know...

35:33.799 --> 35:35.667
father, brother...

35:35.701 --> 35:38.304
friend...

35:38.337 --> 35:41.106
we'll do it different.

35:41.139 --> 35:43.275
No more lying.

35:43.309 --> 35:46.077
No secrets.

35:46.111 --> 35:48.547
And no more fucking porn.

35:50.316 --> 35:51.983
- Okay.

35:53.819 --> 35:55.587
- Come on.

35:55.621 --> 35:58.290
Help me clean shit up.

36:17.343 --> 36:19.177
- Yeah.

36:19.211 --> 36:20.679
- Thanks.

36:25.183 --> 36:28.454
- Gonna wash up.

36:32.324 --> 36:34.326
- Not gonna happen.

36:34.360 --> 36:35.994
Go.

36:55.514 --> 36:57.883
- Don't know.

37:17.769 --> 37:19.705
- Chucky.

37:19.738 --> 37:21.340
You know who Coco
had in the car?

37:21.373 --> 37:22.941
- Yeah.

37:22.974 --> 37:25.210
They just pulled out.
He had a girl with him.

37:31.082 --> 37:33.084
- I'm all right, man.

37:33.118 --> 37:34.453
Just, uh...

37:34.486 --> 37:36.922
Family is so important, Bispo.

37:36.955 --> 37:39.425
Just trying to make
a connection here.

37:39.458 --> 37:41.427
And be part of...

37:41.460 --> 37:43.061
- Okay.

37:43.094 --> 37:44.530
- But I can only do that

37:44.563 --> 37:47.466
if I honor the trust
that others put in me.

37:47.499 --> 37:52.070
- Coco trusting you
with something?

37:52.103 --> 37:53.872
- The girl.

37:53.905 --> 37:55.674
Was it the same girl

37:55.707 --> 37:59.845
you saw him with at the diner?

37:59.878 --> 38:01.613
You get her name?

38:01.647 --> 38:03.281
Was it Adelita?

38:03.315 --> 38:04.950
- I don't know.

38:04.983 --> 38:07.052
- Lying to us would be
very bad, Chucky.

38:07.085 --> 38:09.588
- I can't hold lies.

38:09.621 --> 38:11.890
There's not enough room.

38:14.225 --> 38:17.763
All I know is, this girl...

38:17.796 --> 38:21.967
she's very important to Coco.

38:26.772 --> 38:28.807
- Hmm.

38:33.812 --> 38:35.447
- Shit.

38:43.622 --> 38:46.625
- Espina.

38:46.658 --> 38:49.761
Pedro the Thorn.

38:51.963 --> 38:54.265
- I don't know.

38:54.299 --> 38:57.002
Don't know if he wanted
to get out.

39:01.840 --> 39:04.476
- My father.
Schoolteacher.

39:04.510 --> 39:06.612
Same as your old man.

39:06.645 --> 39:09.948
Yeah.

39:09.981 --> 39:12.150
Before he blew everything up.

39:12.183 --> 39:13.685
- Yeah.

39:13.719 --> 39:15.654
The drink.

39:15.687 --> 39:17.656
- I guess.

39:19.324 --> 39:22.461
Angry Ben.

39:22.494 --> 39:25.497
Pushed all good shit away
that got near him.

39:27.666 --> 39:29.100
Family...

39:29.134 --> 39:31.603
career.

39:31.637 --> 39:35.240
I thought I could
change all that.

39:35.273 --> 39:39.445
Star athlete, scholarships.

39:39.478 --> 39:41.513
Law school.

39:44.750 --> 39:47.252
Federal agent.

39:48.487 --> 39:51.790
- That's not how it works,
son.

39:51.823 --> 39:55.393
Your wins shine a light
on his losses.

39:55.427 --> 39:58.830
- Yeah.

39:58.864 --> 40:02.868
That happen with you?
And EZ?

40:02.901 --> 40:06.237
He was the golden boy.

40:18.416 --> 40:21.286
- Gonna make us
something to eat.

41:22.881 --> 41:25.383
- Cristo...

41:31.857 --> 41:34.325
- Left, please.
- Thanks.

41:34.359 --> 41:36.294
- To the left, sir.
- Thank you.

41:37.295 --> 41:39.064
- Go ahead.

41:44.603 --> 41:46.271
- He has him.

41:46.304 --> 41:48.840
He has him!

41:54.312 --> 41:56.615
- All right.

42:01.086 --> 42:02.654
- Nestor.

42:08.159 --> 42:09.995
- Follow me, please, sir.

42:14.165 --> 42:16.134
- Follow me.

42:30.415 --> 42:32.517
- This way.

42:38.857 --> 42:40.926
- Maybe it's because
he has the baby?

42:40.959 --> 42:42.861
- Perhaps.

42:47.999 --> 42:49.701
- Have a seat, Mr. Galindo.

42:51.502 --> 42:53.004
I'm a dual citizen.

42:53.038 --> 42:54.806
My son is a U.S. citizen.

42:54.840 --> 42:56.141
- Yeah, we know.

42:56.174 --> 42:58.043
Please, sit.

42:58.076 --> 42:59.377
- I need you to hand me
the baby, sir.

43:00.746 --> 43:03.081
- I understand this
is inconvenient,

43:03.114 --> 43:04.650
but we need to check
that baby.

43:07.452 --> 43:10.255
Weapons, or...

43:10.288 --> 43:14.059
- Give us the blanket.

43:14.092 --> 43:15.827
- Sorry.

43:24.903 --> 43:27.272
- Yeah, yeah, pronto, pronto.

43:37.983 --> 43:39.284
- Wait, that's not my...

43:41.086 --> 43:43.554
- Yeah, I need you
to test something.

43:43.588 --> 43:45.523
Mm-hmm.

43:46.557 --> 43:48.894
- I want to call my lawyer.
- I'm sure you do.

43:48.927 --> 43:51.062
Take Mr. Galindo's son.
Find him something to wear.

43:51.096 --> 43:52.397
A warm blanket.

43:52.430 --> 43:54.499
- No, wait.
- Mr. Galindo.

43:54.532 --> 43:56.234
Don't make this worse
than it is.

44:40.712 --> 44:41.880
- Adelita.

44:45.316 --> 44:46.451
- Andres.

45:46.744 --> 45:47.779
- Aah--

46:24.315 --> 46:25.716
- He's in the Templo
with Hank.

46:25.750 --> 46:27.318
Why?

46:27.352 --> 46:28.854
- I was in the bathroom.

46:28.887 --> 46:31.056
Front office.

46:31.089 --> 46:34.259
Heard Bishop and Hank
grilling Chucky about Coco.

46:34.292 --> 46:36.594
Asking him about Leti.

46:36.627 --> 46:39.397
And if her name's Adelita.

46:43.768 --> 46:45.803
- Bishop thinks Coco's
the fucking mole.

46:45.837 --> 46:47.572
- Shit.

46:50.475 --> 46:54.045
That's why he's been
separating us.

47:01.352 --> 47:08.326
*

47:08.359 --> 47:10.028
- Beautiful fucking night.

47:14.032 --> 47:16.501
- Yeah, it is.

47:16.534 --> 47:23.008
- * I hear something
hanging on the wind *

47:23.041 --> 47:29.747
* I see black smoke
up around the bend *

47:29.780 --> 47:35.320
* I got my ticket and
I'm going to go *

47:35.353 --> 47:37.655
*

47:37.688 --> 47:44.695
* Home

47:45.330 --> 47:50.435
*

47:50.468 --> 47:57.142
* The leaves have changed
a time or two *

47:57.175 --> 48:03.348
* Since the last time
the train came through *

48:03.381 --> 48:08.954
* I've got my ticket
and I'm going to go *

48:08.987 --> 48:11.156
*

48:11.189 --> 48:18.063
* Home

48:20.065 --> 48:24.402
*

48:24.435 --> 48:29.407
* Home

48:29.440 --> 48:34.712
* I want to go home

48:34.745 --> 48:41.752
*

48:46.291 --> 48:52.463
* My father's father's blood
is on the tracks *

48:52.497 --> 48:59.204
* A sweet refrain drifts in
from the past *

48:59.237 --> 49:06.244
* I've got my ticket
and I'm going to go *

49:07.078 --> 49:14.085
* Home

49:16.254 --> 49:20.158
*

49:20.191 --> 49:26.964
* The winding roads
that led me here *

49:26.998 --> 49:33.071
* Burn like coal
and dry like tears *

49:33.104 --> 49:39.477
* So here's my hope,
my tired soul *

49:39.510 --> 49:46.517
* And here's my ticket,
I want to go *

49:47.452 --> 49:53.391
* Home

49:53.424 --> 49:56.594
- I'll lock it up.

49:56.627 --> 50:00.198
*

50:00.231 --> 50:01.499
Night, Chucky.

50:01.532 --> 50:04.469
- Buenos noches.
Sleep well, amigo.

50:11.142 --> 50:13.644
- Lovely night for a walk.

50:15.313 --> 50:16.647
- Yeah.

50:24.021 --> 50:25.790
- Hola, el catito.

50:25.823 --> 50:27.125
Hola.

50:27.158 --> 50:29.227
Ven aqui, ven aqui.

50:30.295 --> 50:32.697
Aw...

50:35.700 --> 50:38.803
Tell me, my wise,
felinous friend.

50:38.836 --> 50:42.307
You roam behind those
rusty gates.

50:42.340 --> 50:47.011
What unspeakable truths lie
twisted amongst the scrap?

50:47.044 --> 50:51.216
Hmm?

50:51.249 --> 50:53.451
Hmm. Hmm.
