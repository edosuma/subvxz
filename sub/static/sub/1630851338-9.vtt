11:29.222 --> 11:32.524
He wasn't picking at his
suitcase because he was nervous.

11:32.526 --> 11:34.391
He was leaving us
a bread crumb.

11:34.428 --> 11:36.293
[muffled shouting]

11:49.943 --> 11:52.176
We should have stopped
at the armory.

11:53.513 --> 11:55.346
[muffled shouting]

11:55.348 --> 11:56.548
Show yourself!

11:56.550 --> 11:57.749
Police!

11:57.884 --> 11:59.350
[muffled shouting]

12:01.988 --> 12:03.387
Oh my god!

12:05.258 --> 12:07.291
Oh, henry, are you all right?
What happened?

12:07.327 --> 12:08.560
Higgins:
There was a kidnapping.

12:08.562 --> 12:10.361
They've taken
the ransom money.

12:10.496 --> 12:12.263
-What about lucinda?
-I never saw her.

12:12.299 --> 12:13.965
-Where did they go?
-I don't know.

12:14.100 --> 12:15.266
They-they snuck up behind me

12:15.335 --> 12:16.901
And they put that
over my head and...

12:16.970 --> 12:18.570
After that they left.

12:18.705 --> 12:19.904
I think someone
came back...

12:19.940 --> 12:21.772
Then you came.

12:21.808 --> 12:23.574
How long has it been
since they were here?

12:23.643 --> 12:24.976
Half an hour, maybe.

12:25.045 --> 12:26.945
Sir, look.

12:28.114 --> 12:29.814
"we said no coppers."

12:29.850 --> 12:30.915
They knew who I was.

12:31.050 --> 12:33.251
-Not necessarily.
-Oh, good lord.

12:33.386 --> 12:34.919
It's a finger.

12:36.089 --> 12:37.888
They cut off her finger.

12:46.065 --> 12:47.732
I was standing there,
but no one came.

12:47.734 --> 12:49.667
And then
the telephone rang.

12:49.802 --> 12:50.835
[phone rings]

12:50.904 --> 12:52.270
Hello?

12:52.339 --> 12:54.138
<i>Kidnapper: There is a streetcar</i>
<i> approaching in two minutes.</i>

12:54.141 --> 12:55.540
<i> Get on.</i>

12:55.542 --> 12:58.543
<i> Disembark when you see</i>
<i> the man with the newspaper.</i>

12:58.545 --> 13:00.678
Where are you?
Why can't we do it here?

13:00.680 --> 13:02.480
<i> Kidnapper: Follow the man</i>
<i> with the newspaper.</i>

13:02.549 --> 13:05.416
<i> If you're not on</i>
<i> the streetcar, she dies.</i>

13:05.452 --> 13:07.151
What?

13:13.093 --> 13:15.159
Operator? Operator?

13:15.228 --> 13:17.228
<i> Operator: Good morning.</i>
<i> How can I direct your call?</i>

13:17.230 --> 13:20.231
Get me george crabtree
at station house number four.

13:20.233 --> 13:21.499
Quickly.

13:21.634 --> 13:23.634
I told george what I could
and then I got on the streetcar.

13:23.703 --> 13:25.036
I didn't know
where I was going,

13:25.038 --> 13:26.570
So I wanted to
leave a trail.

13:26.606 --> 13:28.706
So, you left the nameplate
from the briefcase.

13:28.775 --> 13:30.842
Yes. At carlaw there was
a man with a newspaper.

13:30.977 --> 13:32.844
He was holding it up
over his face

13:32.979 --> 13:34.379
So I couldn't see
who he was.

13:34.514 --> 13:35.747
As soon as I stepped off,

13:35.882 --> 13:37.515
He started walking
toward the warehouse.

13:52.699 --> 13:55.033
No one was around.
I followed him inside.

13:55.035 --> 13:56.534
As soon as I stepped
inside the warehouse,

13:56.536 --> 13:57.534
Someone grabbed me
from behind.

13:57.571 --> 13:59.203
And after that...

13:59.239 --> 14:02.073
Well, you know everything
what happened after that.

14:02.208 --> 14:04.141
That was very clever henry,

14:04.177 --> 14:06.744
Calling george from within
the same telephone call.

14:06.746 --> 14:08.713
I don't think
it was, sir.

14:08.782 --> 14:10.281
Someone must have
been watching.

14:10.416 --> 14:11.348
They knew
I called the police.

14:11.384 --> 14:13.484
"we said no coppers."

14:13.553 --> 14:15.619
They cut off her
finger because of me.

14:15.655 --> 14:18.089
[laughs]

14:18.158 --> 14:20.624
Well, I just
don't believe it.

14:20.660 --> 14:21.959
Believe what?

14:22.028 --> 14:23.862
Kidnappers are only
ever after money.

14:23.997 --> 14:26.430
Lucinda is perfectly fine.

14:26.499 --> 14:28.099
She's missing a finger.

14:28.101 --> 14:29.434
You want a finger?
I can get you a finger.

14:29.436 --> 14:31.702
There are ways, dear.

14:31.838 --> 14:33.337
What exactly do you mean?

14:33.339 --> 14:36.974
There is absolutely no chance
that finger belongs to lucinda.

14:53.359 --> 14:54.992
Well?

14:55.128 --> 14:56.727
It's a match.

14:56.796 --> 14:59.397
This is lucinda
helmsworthy's finger.

14:59.532 --> 15:02.734
I've never done a postmortem
on a digit before,

15:02.736 --> 15:04.535
But I can tell you it was
severed very recently,

15:04.537 --> 15:06.070
Within the last
couple of hours,

15:06.205 --> 15:08.139
With a very sharp blade.

15:08.141 --> 15:12.209
It appears I am
off to mimico.

15:14.180 --> 15:15.680
You seem displeased.

15:15.749 --> 15:17.148
I am.

15:20.887 --> 15:22.619
It's been lovely
catching up, julia,

15:22.656 --> 15:26.090
But let's get down
to brass tacks.

15:26.092 --> 15:28.760
I asked you here
to offer you a job.

15:28.895 --> 15:30.161
At the women's clinic?

15:30.163 --> 15:33.564
I heard you were seeking
employment and we need the help.

15:33.633 --> 15:35.800
You know I admire
the work you do, kate.

15:35.869 --> 15:39.637
But it's a medical clinic,
not a hospital.

15:39.772 --> 15:41.105
I'm a surgeon.

15:41.107 --> 15:43.508
That's precisely why
we want you to join us.

15:43.643 --> 15:46.144
We don't have much space

15:46.146 --> 15:47.979
And we don't have
many resources,

15:48.114 --> 15:50.848
But we think it would be
beneficial for our patients

15:50.984 --> 15:53.918
If we had someone who
could do small

15:53.987 --> 15:56.788
In-house surgeries,
as required.

15:56.923 --> 16:00.124
I don't mean to dismiss
the work you do.

16:00.259 --> 16:03.594
The dispensary
is a remarkable place.

16:03.596 --> 16:05.897
Allowing women to be
treated by other women

16:06.032 --> 16:08.332
Is a success
in and of itself.

16:08.334 --> 16:11.702
But I'm not sure
it's the right fit for me.

16:11.705 --> 16:13.270
I understand.

16:13.306 --> 16:16.207
You're one of the most highly
respected surgeons in the field.

16:16.276 --> 16:20.078
And I feel I need to remain at
the vanguard of modern medicine.

16:20.213 --> 16:21.545
Women treating women

16:21.581 --> 16:24.148
Is the vanguard
of modern medicine, julia.

16:24.184 --> 16:25.750
I'm sorry, kate.

16:25.752 --> 16:28.552
I'm sure there are
many doctors and nurses

16:28.588 --> 16:30.955
Capable of the work
you're describing.

16:31.090 --> 16:34.458
I appreciate you taking
the time to consider it.

16:38.965 --> 16:40.498
There's something
you should know.

16:40.500 --> 16:41.933
Oh?

16:42.068 --> 16:43.634
I'm not supposed
to say anything,

16:43.636 --> 16:46.837
But my brother is a doctor
at st. Tristan's.

16:46.873 --> 16:49.040
There's a rumour.

16:49.042 --> 16:50.507
Rumour?

16:50.543 --> 16:53.244
Toronto mercy has put
out the word on you.

16:53.379 --> 16:54.845
Put the word out?

16:54.881 --> 16:56.380
I fear you've been
blacklisted.

17:00.487 --> 17:02.720
This is where
they broke in.

17:02.789 --> 17:04.655
They dragged her
round front

17:04.657 --> 17:05.890
Where their carriage
was waiting.

17:06.025 --> 17:08.860
As I said, we didn't
dare to follow.

17:08.862 --> 17:10.360
Watts:
Detective!

17:12.766 --> 17:14.598
Boot prints.

17:14.667 --> 17:17.468
Do you recognize
the tread, mr. Newsome?

17:17.537 --> 17:19.369
I imagine they're
from the kidnappers.

17:23.443 --> 17:25.076
Gasoline.

17:25.078 --> 17:27.211
-Gasoline?
-Gasoline?

17:27.247 --> 17:29.747
Oh. Gasoline.

17:29.749 --> 17:31.682
Are you sure they were
in a carriage, mr. Newsome,

17:31.684 --> 17:33.551
And not an automobile?

17:33.686 --> 17:34.918
I'm quite sure, yes.

17:37.356 --> 17:39.824
Blacklisted?
They can't do that to you.

17:39.893 --> 17:41.825
Apparently,
they already have.

17:41.861 --> 17:44.161
Even your dismissal
was entirely unjust.

17:44.197 --> 17:45.629
You can't stand for this!

17:45.665 --> 17:47.899
I'm not sure I have
a say in the matter.

17:47.901 --> 17:49.100
Of course you do.

17:49.102 --> 17:50.568
You were fired because
you're a woman

17:50.703 --> 17:53.037
Who did her job better
than her male counterparts.

17:53.172 --> 17:54.972
Yes, but how would
we prove that?

17:54.974 --> 17:58.309
Well, if they've been telling
other hospitals not to hire you,

17:58.311 --> 17:59.577
There may be some
evidence of it.

17:59.712 --> 18:02.713
If we can find it,
we'll sue them into the ground.

18:02.749 --> 18:03.781
What do you say?

18:05.985 --> 18:06.917
Let's.

18:10.290 --> 18:11.655
It's only a pinkie.

18:11.724 --> 18:13.724
It is not only
a pinkie, ruth.

18:13.726 --> 18:15.792
It is an indication of
that which they are capable.

18:15.829 --> 18:17.395
-[distant plane engine]
-[baby cries]

18:17.397 --> 18:20.197
Oh! Come, come, come, come!

18:20.233 --> 18:21.399
That's quite enough!

18:21.534 --> 18:22.800
I am calling bucky fanshaw

18:22.935 --> 18:24.335
And I'm giving him
a piece of my mind.

18:24.404 --> 18:26.737
I don't think he has
a telephone in the aero, ruthie.

18:26.773 --> 18:28.272
Anything, watts?

18:28.407 --> 18:31.008
Yes, but nothing
related to the case.

18:31.010 --> 18:35.946
[phone rings]

18:39.052 --> 18:40.551
Helmsworthy residence.

18:40.587 --> 18:41.819
<i> Lucinda:</i>
<i> Dadah.</i>

18:41.888 --> 18:43.487
It's her!

18:43.490 --> 18:46.390
Lucy, where are you?
Are you all right?

18:46.392 --> 18:48.292
<i> Lucinda:</i>
<i> They cut off my finger, dadah.</i>

18:48.427 --> 18:50.227
<i> Just give them</i>

18:50.263 --> 18:51.929
<i> Please! I'm scared.</i>

18:52.064 --> 18:54.031
What do you mean?
What do they want?

18:54.167 --> 18:55.632
More money?

18:55.668 --> 18:57.435
We'll give them anything.

18:57.437 --> 18:58.636
<i> Kidnapper:</i>
<i> Who's "we"?</i>

18:58.638 --> 18:59.971
What?

18:59.973 --> 19:03.040
<i> Kidnapper:</i>
<i>I said no police. Now she dies.</i>

19:03.076 --> 19:04.775
No! Don't!

19:04.844 --> 19:06.110
I'll do anything.

19:06.179 --> 19:08.946
[plane flying overhead]

19:10.116 --> 19:11.982
I could hear the airplane
through the telephone.

19:12.117 --> 19:13.718
Meaning they're nearby.

19:13.853 --> 19:16.853
Is there an automobile
garage close by?

19:16.990 --> 19:18.823
Someplace where they
would store gasoline?

19:18.958 --> 19:22.259
The neighbours
have a garage,

19:22.395 --> 19:24.228
But they've been
in rhodesia for ages.

19:25.598 --> 19:27.431
Lead the way, man!
Her life is in danger.

19:36.009 --> 19:37.175
Lucinda!

19:38.578 --> 19:39.577
-No!
-Rupert!

19:39.646 --> 19:41.545
Mr. Newsome! No!

19:41.581 --> 19:43.981
Lucinda! Lucinda!

19:44.050 --> 19:45.449
Rupert!

19:45.451 --> 19:46.617
Lucinda!

19:46.752 --> 19:48.352
Murdoch: It's too dangerous.
You can't go in there.

19:48.388 --> 19:49.687
Lucinda!

19:49.756 --> 19:51.088
Stop, mr. Newsome!
It's not safe.

19:51.224 --> 19:53.291
No!

19:55.227 --> 19:56.427
They're fleeing!

20:08.708 --> 20:10.908
Hart: I can see why
you don't like mimico.

20:11.043 --> 20:14.312
I've encountered nothing but
foolishness and tragedy there.

20:15.815 --> 20:17.981
I suppose the cause
of death is self-evident?

20:18.017 --> 20:20.384
I'll proceed with
the postmortem nevertheless.

20:20.519 --> 20:24.388
I'm not quite sure how
to ask this, but, uh,

20:24.424 --> 20:26.924
How many fingers
have you found?

20:26.993 --> 20:30.127
She's missing the fifth digit
on her left hand.

20:31.164 --> 20:33.531
Very good.
Thank you, mrs. Hart.

20:35.001 --> 20:36.400
So, the garage next door,

20:36.402 --> 20:38.335
Do you think that's where they
were holding her from the start?

20:38.371 --> 20:40.604
There wasn't enough evidence
to tell one way or the other

20:40.607 --> 20:41.806
After the fire.

20:41.808 --> 20:44.675
But whoever did do this
knew the place was empty.

20:44.810 --> 20:45.943
So, they know the area.

20:46.078 --> 20:49.280
Perhaps a friend,
or neighbour, maybe?

20:49.282 --> 20:50.514
Right.

20:50.550 --> 20:52.382
I'll head back to mimico,
ask rupert newsome

20:52.418 --> 20:54.518
If any of the locals
have grievances with him.

20:54.587 --> 20:56.554
One can only
imagine they do.

20:56.556 --> 20:58.055
Ah - news.

20:58.057 --> 21:00.224
An automobile matching the one
driving away from the garage

21:00.226 --> 21:02.993
Was found parked downtown
on frederick street.

21:03.029 --> 21:04.528
Did you examine
it for evidence?

21:04.530 --> 21:05.763
I did.

21:07.533 --> 21:09.366
Murdoch:
Badge is missing.

21:10.569 --> 21:11.835
The money is gone,
too, I assume?

21:11.904 --> 21:13.471
In a sense.

21:13.473 --> 21:14.805
What on earth?

21:17.710 --> 21:19.176
Newspaper.

21:21.747 --> 21:24.782
This is the briefcase, but
I swear there was money in it.

21:24.784 --> 21:25.783
I checked.

21:25.918 --> 21:27.718
So, the kidnappers
took the real money out

21:27.720 --> 21:29.853
And replaced it
with newspaper?

21:29.922 --> 21:31.488
Why would they do that?

21:32.892 --> 21:35.326
Are you certain
the money was inside the case?

21:35.395 --> 21:37.328
I watched rupert
newsome put the money in

21:37.330 --> 21:39.396
After the payment
was delivered.

21:39.398 --> 21:40.864
Murdoch:
Someone could have removed it

21:40.900 --> 21:43.200
Between then
and the time you left the house.

21:43.236 --> 21:45.136
Right before I left...

21:45.271 --> 21:47.071
I checked it again.

21:56.549 --> 21:59.283
Murdoch: How thoroughly?
Did you see every bill?

22:01.620 --> 22:03.754
Or is it possible
what you saw

22:03.756 --> 22:07.091
Was only the top
layer of bills?

22:07.160 --> 22:08.559
Oh, no.

22:08.561 --> 22:10.428
That's why lucinda
helmsworthy said,

22:10.430 --> 22:13.297
"give them what they want,"
when she called the house.

22:13.432 --> 22:15.899
They never got
the money.

22:15.935 --> 22:18.702
What henry delivered
was not payment,

22:18.705 --> 22:22.306
But a cleverly disguised
dead ringer for the money.

22:22.441 --> 22:24.975
They said it was too late.
That's why they killed her.

22:25.044 --> 22:26.711
It's all my fault.

22:26.846 --> 22:29.179
It's not your fault, henry.

22:29.215 --> 22:32.249
It's the fault of
whoever stole the money.

22:32.318 --> 22:34.518
If it was swapped out
before you left,

22:34.520 --> 22:36.987
Then whoever took it must
have been in the house.

22:37.056 --> 22:39.757
It was in the sitting
room the entire time.

22:39.759 --> 22:41.057
The money was
delivered at nine am,

22:41.094 --> 22:43.060
And we left to make
the drop at 10.

22:43.195 --> 22:45.529
Think, henry,
after rupert newsome

22:45.664 --> 22:47.998
Filled the case
with the money

22:48.034 --> 22:51.602
Was anyone at any point
left alone with it?

22:51.671 --> 22:53.270
I don't know.

22:53.272 --> 22:55.606
Yes.

22:55.608 --> 22:58.342
Yes, someone was
alone with the money.

22:58.411 --> 23:02.279
Why were you so eager to deliver
the money yourself, helmsworthy?

23:02.281 --> 23:04.615
My daughter's
life was in danger.

23:04.684 --> 23:08.352
She died because
that fool muddled everything.

23:08.487 --> 23:11.088
There was never any money in
the case in the first place.

23:11.223 --> 23:12.990
Brackenreid:
Someone took it.

23:13.125 --> 23:14.959
And you're the one
who could have done it.

23:14.961 --> 23:17.093
I stole
the ransom money?

23:17.130 --> 23:19.096
You were on your own
with it in the sitting room.

23:19.098 --> 23:20.297
Why were you there?

23:20.366 --> 23:23.633
How dare you?
My daughter is dead!

23:23.669 --> 23:25.569
An outcome you may
not have predicted.

23:25.605 --> 23:27.204
But you were desperate
for the money,

23:27.240 --> 23:28.639
So you were willing
to take risks.

23:28.708 --> 23:31.608
We checked your bank accounts,
nearly empty.

23:31.610 --> 23:32.710
What bank accounts?

23:32.712 --> 23:35.446
-Dominion. Imperial.
-Toronto banks.

23:35.515 --> 23:38.248
Of course they're empty.
I haven't lived here in years.

23:38.284 --> 23:40.050
Murdoch:
And now you've reappeared.

23:40.052 --> 23:41.986
You've re-entered
into your daughter's life,

23:41.988 --> 23:44.455
And someone has
stolen her money.

23:44.457 --> 23:45.956
And whoever took it

23:46.091 --> 23:48.325
Had already prepared
the fake money.

23:48.361 --> 23:50.060
It was premeditated.

23:50.129 --> 23:52.262
You kidnapped
your own daughter.

23:52.298 --> 23:55.198
You are fools.
I have no need for money.

23:55.234 --> 23:58.268
My clients pay in gold.

23:58.304 --> 24:01.071
Death, gentlemen,
is good business.

24:01.140 --> 24:02.873
Here's a tip,

24:02.942 --> 24:06.477
Invest in both guns
and mortuaries.

24:06.612 --> 24:09.680
One success
feeds the other.

24:12.751 --> 24:15.152
Win or lose, we must
succeed in one objective.

24:15.154 --> 24:17.488
-What's that?
-To embarrass them.

24:17.623 --> 24:19.556
We can certainly do that.

24:21.360 --> 24:23.393
Whether it will change
their behaviour in the future

24:23.463 --> 24:24.595
Is another matter.

24:24.730 --> 24:26.497
So, the accusations of
a hysterical female

24:26.632 --> 24:28.065
Are not enough to
intimidate them?

24:28.067 --> 24:29.633
A judgment will
intimidate.

24:29.635 --> 24:31.802
True power lies
in the courts.

24:31.804 --> 24:33.437
But, of course,
that will take years.

24:33.572 --> 24:35.972
I just want to
humiliate them.

24:36.008 --> 24:38.375
The court case won't be the most
efficient way to do that.

24:38.444 --> 24:40.711
But there may
be another way.

24:40.713 --> 24:43.280
I believe I might be
one step ahead of you, effie.

24:44.584 --> 24:46.717
Do you suppose they
have a telephone?

24:46.786 --> 24:48.185
I don't trust the bugger.

24:48.187 --> 24:49.786
But if he took the money,
where is it?

24:49.822 --> 24:52.323
I asked henry to do
his best to account

24:52.325 --> 24:54.791
For mr. Helmsworthy's
movements between the time

24:54.827 --> 24:57.995
The money arrived and the time
he exited with the briefcase.

25:01.834 --> 25:02.999
What did he say?

25:03.035 --> 25:05.202
Ah, he says helmsworthy
never left the house.

25:05.337 --> 25:07.204
Nor did anyone
else present.

25:07.339 --> 25:09.272
Then it's still there.

25:09.308 --> 25:11.808
Right. Watts, find george
at the newsome estate

25:11.878 --> 25:13.610
And search it
top to bottom.

25:13.746 --> 25:15.612
If it's there,
we shall discover it.

25:15.681 --> 25:18.749
Unless he is cleverer
than us, of course.

25:18.818 --> 25:21.051
In which case
we will likely fail.

25:23.155 --> 25:27.190
But the risk of failure
should not dampen the endeavour.

25:30.295 --> 25:32.296
She's really gone.

25:32.298 --> 25:34.431
I honestly never thought
I'd outlive her.

25:34.433 --> 25:35.932
Nor I.

25:35.968 --> 25:39.169
I mean, we had our differences,
but I never wished for this.

25:39.305 --> 25:41.305
Well, I may have.

25:41.374 --> 25:43.907
But I wouldn't have if I
thought it would really happen.

25:43.910 --> 25:46.043
What am I meant to do?

25:46.112 --> 25:47.911
What do you mean?

25:47.913 --> 25:49.613
My whole life these last
years has been doing that

25:49.749 --> 25:51.848
Which lucinda told me.

25:51.884 --> 25:53.717
What am I to do now?

25:53.786 --> 25:55.152
Some people,
when they lose a spouse,

25:55.221 --> 25:57.721
They just up and die.

25:57.856 --> 25:59.422
They do.

26:01.761 --> 26:04.061
I spoke to rupert about whether
or not he and his wife

26:04.063 --> 26:05.662
Had any enemies
here in mimico.

26:05.698 --> 26:06.930
And?

26:06.933 --> 26:08.732
Well, he says they don't.

26:08.801 --> 26:10.867
But that's not to say all
kinds don't detest him

26:10.903 --> 26:12.069
Without him knowing.

26:12.204 --> 26:13.337
Clearly.

26:13.339 --> 26:15.806
But neighbourly hatred
hardly seems reason enough

26:15.808 --> 26:18.742
To kidnap
and murder his wife.

26:18.877 --> 26:20.277
What about money?

26:20.412 --> 26:22.879
Well, he says he doesn't know
anybody in need of money.

26:22.881 --> 26:24.815
Apparently, all the neighbours
are just as wealthy as they are.

26:24.817 --> 26:27.618
-Although...
-What?

26:27.753 --> 26:31.755
Well, except for ruth
and henry, of course.

26:33.559 --> 26:34.891
Well, there's no
sign of it here.

26:34.893 --> 26:36.560
Shall we try
the second floor?

26:36.562 --> 26:37.461
Right.

26:42.201 --> 26:43.700
Watts!

26:45.404 --> 26:46.770
Hold on a minute.

26:48.040 --> 26:49.840
What are you doing?
Excuse me!

26:49.909 --> 26:51.909
Crabtree:
It's here. The money.

26:55.280 --> 26:56.346
You?

26:58.250 --> 27:00.918
I don't know anything
about that money.

27:01.053 --> 27:02.853
It was found in
your baby's pram.

27:02.855 --> 27:04.921
Are you saying you
didn't put it there?

27:04.923 --> 27:06.523
I'm saying what I said.

27:06.559 --> 27:08.659
I don't know
a thing about it.

27:08.661 --> 27:11.395
You disliked
lucinda helmsworthy.

27:11.397 --> 27:13.263
Yes. That's no secret.

27:13.265 --> 27:16.400
And yet you asked her
for money that very evening.

27:16.469 --> 27:17.867
I did. What of it?

27:17.903 --> 27:20.470
She refused.
You became desperate.

27:20.506 --> 27:21.738
I was annoyed.

27:21.807 --> 27:23.073
You seemed entirely
unconcerned

27:23.208 --> 27:25.943
At mrs. Helmsworthy-newsome's
kidnapping.

27:26.078 --> 27:27.310
No, I wouldn't
say that.

27:27.346 --> 27:29.680
You said,
"everyone gets kidnapped."

27:29.749 --> 27:31.148
Many people do.

27:31.150 --> 27:33.817
You also volunteered henry
to make the delivery.

27:33.853 --> 27:37.287
Would you really send your own
husband to meet with criminals

27:37.356 --> 27:39.556
Knowing he had
not the ransom,

27:39.592 --> 27:41.759
But a dead ringer
briefcase?

27:41.894 --> 27:43.427
Of course I wouldn't.

27:43.429 --> 27:46.163
Unless you knew he was
in no immediate danger.

27:46.232 --> 27:47.831
And how would
I know that?

27:47.900 --> 27:49.700
Because you
arranged all of it.

27:49.835 --> 27:51.501
You hired someone
to kidnap her.

27:51.570 --> 27:52.970
You prepared
the fake money.

27:53.105 --> 27:54.905
You sent henry with
the dead ringer

27:54.974 --> 27:58.374
Knowing the men who received it
were expecting that all along.

27:58.411 --> 28:01.178
Except something
went wrong,

28:01.180 --> 28:03.847
Didn't it,
mrs. Higgins-newsome?

28:05.651 --> 28:08.852
Well, if you
believe that, prove it.

28:12.224 --> 28:13.857
She's definitely
hiding something.

28:13.992 --> 28:15.859
What, I don't know.

28:15.895 --> 28:17.594
She took the money.
It was in her pram.

28:17.596 --> 28:19.129
She claims she didn't.

28:19.131 --> 28:23.133
Perhaps someone else felt
it was a safe place to hide it.

28:23.169 --> 28:25.235
Because she knew
that if we found it,

28:25.271 --> 28:26.603
We'd assume it was her.

28:26.672 --> 28:30.407
I can believe that ruth might
be capable of stealing money.

28:30.409 --> 28:32.342
But to set all of this up?

28:32.477 --> 28:34.144
Brackenreid:
I do tend to agree, murdoch.

28:34.279 --> 28:35.479
The woman's away
with the fairies.

28:35.481 --> 28:37.147
-Sir!
-Higgins, wind your neck in!

28:37.282 --> 28:38.948
I'm on your side, son.

28:38.984 --> 28:40.951
If she didn't do it,
then who did?

28:40.953 --> 28:43.052
Well, she's protecting
someone, but who?

28:43.089 --> 28:44.854
Oh, not...

28:48.294 --> 28:51.227
He was alone with the money,
too, but it's his money.

28:51.263 --> 28:52.896
It can't be him.

28:52.898 --> 28:54.764
It has to be, higgins.

28:54.800 --> 28:56.633
Who's the one
person ruth newsome

28:56.702 --> 28:58.736
Would go to prison
to save?

29:00.839 --> 29:02.438
Ruthie had nothing
to do with it.

29:02.475 --> 29:04.307
It was all me.

29:06.445 --> 29:08.479
I'm the one
who kidnapped my wife.

29:12.985 --> 29:13.917
I did it for love.

29:14.052 --> 29:15.785
You kidnapped
your wife for love?

29:15.821 --> 29:17.921
For the love of
another, detective.

29:17.990 --> 29:21.024
Another woman,
not another detective.

29:22.261 --> 29:26.129
My saviour, my beauty,
my soulmate, helena.

29:26.264 --> 29:29.399
She cared for me,
nurtured me back to health.

29:29.401 --> 29:31.702
Her kindness and
tenderness were things

29:31.704 --> 29:33.537
I had never felt
from lucinda.

29:33.672 --> 29:36.206
We wanted to run
away together.

29:36.275 --> 29:37.741
Couldn't you have
got a divorce?

29:37.743 --> 29:41.078
From lucinda?
Oh, no, no, no.

29:41.213 --> 29:42.546
She would not
have allowed that.

29:42.681 --> 29:44.614
The choice of divorce
lies with the husband.

29:44.650 --> 29:47.684
Legally, but not in
my marriage, inspector.

29:47.686 --> 29:50.620
So you hired someone
to kidnap her instead?

29:50.656 --> 29:53.757
It sounds ignoble
when you put it that way.

29:53.892 --> 29:55.759
Well, it's worse than ignoble.

29:55.828 --> 29:58.094
I just needed the money.

29:58.130 --> 29:59.496
The accounts
are in your name.

29:59.631 --> 30:01.497
Again, legally, yes.

30:01.534 --> 30:04.568
But our finances, like
everything in our beloved union,

30:04.570 --> 30:06.569
Was under the strict
control of lucinda.

30:06.605 --> 30:09.305
I couldn't embezzle a thin
dime without her noticing.

30:09.341 --> 30:11.909
And, so, I endeavoured
to secure enough money

30:12.044 --> 30:14.711
For helena and I
to escape mimico

30:14.780 --> 30:16.380
Through illicit means.

30:16.515 --> 30:18.748
-Kidnapping.
-A fake kidnapping.

30:18.784 --> 30:21.184
But she was
bloody kidnapped!

30:21.220 --> 30:23.453
I didn't even
want it to happen!

30:23.455 --> 30:25.122
I told helena
to call it off.

30:25.257 --> 30:26.657
So it was her
idea, then?

30:26.792 --> 30:28.826
All she did was
provide me with a name.

30:28.961 --> 30:31.261
Someone who could
arrange for such a thing.

30:31.297 --> 30:33.263
I was the one who set
the plan in motion.

30:33.332 --> 30:36.800
But, when the day neared,
I reconsidered.

30:36.869 --> 30:39.269
I told helena
to call it off.

30:39.338 --> 30:41.738
Apparently,
it didn't take.

30:41.740 --> 30:43.740
I was as surprised as anyone
when those men broke in

30:43.809 --> 30:45.175
And took poor lulu.

30:45.177 --> 30:46.776
Freeze!

30:48.981 --> 30:51.314
Rupert: From that point on,
I could only watch in horror

30:51.350 --> 30:52.516
As the events played out.

30:54.486 --> 30:55.885
Lucinda:
Let go of me!

30:55.921 --> 30:57.821
If you didn't want it to happen,
why did you take the money?

30:57.890 --> 31:00.757
What else was I meant to do?
What choice did I have?

31:00.759 --> 31:02.492
The plan was
she would be kidnapped,

31:02.561 --> 31:04.494
And I would secure the ransom.

31:04.496 --> 31:07.631
And I would send a fake
payment in its place

31:07.700 --> 31:10.667
With the kidnappers'
fee layered on top.

31:10.736 --> 31:13.736
The plan was
no one would get hurt

31:13.772 --> 31:16.706
And so I abided.

31:16.742 --> 31:18.374
But something
went wrong.

31:18.410 --> 31:20.644
When did you know
the plan had changed?

31:20.713 --> 31:23.246
When henry stepped on that
streetcar and didn't come back.

31:23.315 --> 31:24.714
That's why I came to you.

31:24.849 --> 31:26.249
You came to us
and lied.

31:26.252 --> 31:29.452
Of course I lied.
I am culpable.

31:29.521 --> 31:32.189
I thought if you could
find her safely,

31:32.324 --> 31:35.926
All would be all right,
but all was not all right.

31:35.995 --> 31:38.261
They must have decided
they wanted more money,

31:38.264 --> 31:40.530
And I would have given it
to them if I'd had the chance.

31:40.599 --> 31:42.866
I'd have given
them everything.

31:42.868 --> 31:44.868
I never wanted
her to be hurt.

31:47.273 --> 31:49.072
You and newsome
fell in love?

31:49.074 --> 31:51.341
Of course.

31:51.343 --> 31:52.843
When did this happen?

31:52.978 --> 31:54.811
As soon as I
laid eyes on him.

31:54.847 --> 31:56.947
He's such a wise
and kind man.

31:56.949 --> 32:00.284
[laughs]

32:00.419 --> 32:02.419
And you helped him
plan a kidnapping.

32:02.421 --> 32:04.320
What? Of course not.

32:04.356 --> 32:05.956
He told us it
was your idea.

32:05.958 --> 32:07.791
Well, that's mad.
I love him but...

32:07.793 --> 32:10.026
Drop the act, love.
He let it slip.

32:10.095 --> 32:13.129
Implicating you
serves him no benefit.

32:16.234 --> 32:17.900
I never loved
that twit.

32:17.937 --> 32:19.636
I was using him
for his money.

32:19.638 --> 32:23.506
Then I found out he was too
scared of his wife to take it.

32:23.542 --> 32:25.776
So you introduced
him to the kidnapper.

32:25.911 --> 32:27.777
He wanted to
run away with me.

32:27.846 --> 32:29.846
He thought up
various idiotic ways

32:29.848 --> 32:31.581
To try to find the money.

32:31.650 --> 32:33.250
When he landed
upon a kidnapping,

32:33.252 --> 32:34.985
I told him I knew a man.

32:35.120 --> 32:37.854
That was the beginning
and end of my role.

32:37.923 --> 32:39.589
Did you call it off
when he asked you?

32:39.725 --> 32:42.726
Yes. Apparently, the message
didn't get through.

32:42.861 --> 32:44.728
Murdoch:
All protestations aside,

32:44.797 --> 32:46.863
You were involved in
the planning of a serious crime

32:46.865 --> 32:48.598
Which resulted in a murder.

32:48.734 --> 32:50.533
You are guilty.

32:50.569 --> 32:51.801
Me?

32:51.870 --> 32:54.071
Do you really think
a jury will believe

32:54.206 --> 32:56.539
I had anything
to do with this?

32:56.575 --> 32:59.142
Newsome's
the one you want.

32:59.144 --> 33:01.010
He's the one you can hang.

33:01.046 --> 33:03.679
Let me go and I'll tell
you everything I know.

33:10.155 --> 33:11.955
It's bad, ruthie.

33:12.090 --> 33:13.223
He may hang for this.

33:13.225 --> 33:14.624
But he didn't
kill anybody!

33:14.693 --> 33:16.893
He hired the kidnapper,
so he's responsible.

33:16.895 --> 33:18.495
It's called
constructive murder.

33:18.630 --> 33:20.696
Henry,
you have to help him.

33:20.833 --> 33:22.265
My hands are tied, dear.

33:22.401 --> 33:24.034
You know, you're lucky
you're not behind bars.

33:24.103 --> 33:25.569
I didn't do
anything.

33:25.704 --> 33:26.969
You ended up
with the money.

33:27.006 --> 33:29.239
I saw rupert hiding it.

33:29.241 --> 33:31.107
I knew it would
be found instantly.

33:31.176 --> 33:33.510
I aided him without
his knowledge.

33:33.645 --> 33:35.845
Also, we need
that money, henry.

33:35.881 --> 33:37.180
Can't we just keep it?

33:37.315 --> 33:38.981
It's ransom money!

33:39.018 --> 33:40.850
Yes, but whose is it now?

33:40.886 --> 33:42.386
Rupert and lucinda
won't need it.

33:42.521 --> 33:44.321
And possession
is nine-tenths of the law.

33:44.456 --> 33:46.189
It's not, actually.

33:46.225 --> 33:48.324
You do realize you would
have gone to prison for him

33:48.394 --> 33:49.592
If we hadn't
figured out the truth.

33:49.628 --> 33:51.261
Well, what choice
did I have?

33:51.396 --> 33:53.196
He would never
make it in prison.

33:53.198 --> 33:54.531
Oh! And you would?

33:54.666 --> 33:56.867
I'd be fine.

34:09.214 --> 34:10.413
Thank you.

34:10.482 --> 34:12.716
Landlady says she hasn't
seen him in a few days.

34:12.851 --> 34:15.218
So, before
the kidnapping happened.

34:15.353 --> 34:17.753
Perhaps he set up
the safe house in the garage

34:17.790 --> 34:20.290
And, when it burned,
he fled altogether?

34:20.359 --> 34:22.859
Along with his
unknown associates.

34:22.928 --> 34:24.360
Anything left behind?

34:24.430 --> 34:26.963
Yes. This...

34:26.965 --> 34:28.298
Nope.

34:28.367 --> 34:31.634
This was
in the wastebasket.

34:33.839 --> 34:37.640
"helmsworthy estate.
Mimico. September 4th."

34:37.642 --> 34:39.242
The date she was taken.

34:39.311 --> 34:41.011
Why leave this behind?

34:41.013 --> 34:43.847
And where has he gone?

34:43.849 --> 34:47.183
I don't know, detective,
but I fear we'll never find him.

34:53.459 --> 34:55.291
A lawsuit
could take years.

34:55.327 --> 34:57.994
The idea of a lawsuit
could capture the attention

34:58.030 --> 34:59.863
Of your readers
in an instant.

34:59.865 --> 35:01.797
Plus we could make all
the off-the-record claims

35:01.934 --> 35:03.733
We'd never be able
to make in a court.

35:03.769 --> 35:06.303
But are nonetheless true.

35:06.305 --> 35:07.970
They fired you because
you are a woman,

35:08.006 --> 35:09.539
More precisely
because you're a woman

35:09.608 --> 35:11.474
Who is smarter than they are.

35:11.477 --> 35:13.276
Let's burn them
to the ground.

35:18.683 --> 35:20.350
[laughs]

35:20.419 --> 35:21.685
I love it.

35:21.820 --> 35:23.820
Of course, mercy will fight
back, but who cares?

35:23.955 --> 35:25.221
It'll be fun.

35:25.257 --> 35:26.956
What do you
mean fight back?

35:27.025 --> 35:30.227
If I write, "a woman is
suing the hospital,"

35:30.362 --> 35:32.428
They will find another paper
and have them write,

35:32.430 --> 35:35.165
"ah! A woman is suing
the hospital."

35:35.167 --> 35:36.966
Of course, they're
going to attack you, julia.

35:37.035 --> 35:38.434
But so what?

35:38.470 --> 35:40.169
Think of all we
can accomplish.

35:40.205 --> 35:41.704
Nothing will be
accomplished.

35:41.740 --> 35:44.641
If anything, my claims will
discredit me even further.

35:44.643 --> 35:47.343
-Only in the eyes of some.
-In the eyes of those in power.

35:47.345 --> 35:49.179
But the publicity
will help the case.

35:49.314 --> 35:51.314
Yes, but nothing
will change.

35:51.316 --> 35:53.316
We could get
your job back.

35:53.451 --> 35:54.651
In time.

35:54.786 --> 35:57.053
The last thing I want
is to go back to that place

35:57.055 --> 35:58.254
And work with
those people.

36:02.360 --> 36:05.728
In fact, I'm going to do
something else entirely.

36:12.671 --> 36:14.938
Thank you for
catching mr. Newsome.

36:14.940 --> 36:16.873
I understand he has
considerable resources,

36:17.008 --> 36:19.008
But so do I.

36:19.143 --> 36:21.277
I happen to know
more than one old boy

36:21.313 --> 36:22.746
Who works for the crown.

36:22.881 --> 36:25.615
I'm confident rupert newsome
will face the consequences

36:25.684 --> 36:27.183
He deserves.

36:27.186 --> 36:29.218
Our only regret is
that it's unlikely now

36:29.254 --> 36:30.987
We'll find the men
who kidnapped your daughter.

36:31.122 --> 36:33.423
But we will continue
to pursue them

36:33.425 --> 36:35.458
As long as they
remain at large.

36:35.460 --> 36:37.360
Thank you both.

36:40.932 --> 36:42.532
Detective, constable.

36:42.534 --> 36:43.533
Mrs. Hart.

36:43.668 --> 36:45.368
I have rather
peculiar news.

36:45.370 --> 36:46.569
I don't know what it means,

36:46.572 --> 36:48.104
But perhaps you can
make sense of it.

36:48.173 --> 36:49.205
What is it?

36:49.241 --> 36:50.907
The finger.
It doesn't match the body.

36:53.312 --> 36:54.577
It must.

36:54.613 --> 36:56.913
I checked print on
the finger myself.

36:57.048 --> 36:58.715
It belongs to
lucinda helmsworthy.

36:58.784 --> 37:00.283
I'm quite certain,
detective.

37:00.285 --> 37:02.385
The severed digit was
sliced at approximately

37:02.520 --> 37:05.455
Two millimetres further down
the proximal phalange.

37:05.524 --> 37:06.956
Then it's not
her finger?

37:09.194 --> 37:10.793
No, it is her finger, george.

37:10.829 --> 37:12.996
It's not her body.

37:13.131 --> 37:14.731
Well, how can that be?

37:14.800 --> 37:16.666
You said you saw her
in the building.

37:16.668 --> 37:18.068
It went up in flames.

37:18.203 --> 37:20.403
The kidnappers
escaped the fire

37:20.405 --> 37:22.605
In a motorized carriage.

37:22.608 --> 37:25.475
She must have somehow
escaped the flames with them.

37:25.477 --> 37:27.744
Then whose body
did we find?

37:29.615 --> 37:32.549
Death gentlemen,
is good business.

37:32.684 --> 37:34.417
Here's a tip,

37:34.453 --> 37:37.687
Invest in both
guns and mortuaries.

37:37.723 --> 37:41.023
One success
feeds the other.

37:41.025 --> 37:43.093
Mr. Helmsworthy.

37:43.095 --> 37:44.561
He owns a mortuary.

37:44.696 --> 37:46.362
He must have somehow
obtained a body.

37:46.398 --> 37:50.399
Why? What's he after?
Is he behind all of this?

37:50.435 --> 37:51.767
Yes.

37:51.803 --> 37:53.436
But I'm afraid the truth
is far more sinister.

37:53.438 --> 37:54.537
Come.

38:24.803 --> 38:27.036
Lucinda helmsworthy.

38:28.340 --> 38:29.973
You!

38:30.108 --> 38:33.008
No!

38:34.346 --> 38:36.279
I did everything right!

38:36.414 --> 38:39.982
You weren't supposed to find out
until that fool was hanged!

38:46.158 --> 38:47.890
I found out about rupert's
silly kidnapping plot

38:47.926 --> 38:50.426
When his hired man came
straight over and told me.

38:50.562 --> 38:51.894
He was a petty thief.

38:51.963 --> 38:53.763
If I was willing to pay
him not to do it,

38:53.799 --> 38:56.099
Then he could make his money
and do nothing.

38:56.168 --> 38:58.167
Who was rupert going
to tell, the police?

38:58.236 --> 39:01.304
You then hired this man
to stage your own kidnapping?

39:01.373 --> 39:02.772
God, no.

39:02.808 --> 39:06.976
I paid him triple rupert's fee
to leave town, not come back.

39:07.012 --> 39:10.913
And then I brought in
my own men, capable men.

39:10.949 --> 39:12.448
Who were they?

39:12.484 --> 39:14.316
What does it matter?
They've done nothing wrong.

39:14.353 --> 39:17.653
They desecrated a dead body
under your direction.

39:17.689 --> 39:20.390
You'll never prove
where that body came from.

39:20.392 --> 39:22.725
It was in the garage.

39:22.794 --> 39:24.794
We found it there.

39:24.796 --> 39:26.729
The fire started
accidentally.

39:26.798 --> 39:28.464
You cut off its finger.

39:28.533 --> 39:31.301
Did we?

39:31.303 --> 39:33.536
Prove it.

39:33.538 --> 39:37.173
Mrs. Helmsworthy-newsome,
tricking the police

39:37.175 --> 39:39.809
Into believing a serious crime
has been committed

39:39.811 --> 39:43.679
Is in and of itself
a serious crime.

39:43.715 --> 39:45.614
No, no. No.
We said no police.

39:45.650 --> 39:47.217
Everything else
was an accident.

39:50.355 --> 39:52.555
Even if you get away
with all of this,

39:52.591 --> 39:57.093
Was it really worth
cutting off your own finger?

39:57.228 --> 39:59.328
What, this?

39:59.364 --> 40:01.230
I barely felt a thing.

40:01.299 --> 40:04.300
I'd cut off my own hand
to watch that man hang.

40:05.570 --> 40:07.436
Crown attorney says
it's a complete cock-up.

40:07.472 --> 40:09.372
A jury will never
be able to understand

40:09.507 --> 40:10.773
What the bloody hell happened,

40:10.842 --> 40:13.442
Or even why these idiots
are being charged.

40:13.478 --> 40:16.579
It's criminal
conspiracy, sir.

40:16.615 --> 40:18.914
To what, exactly?
To kill someone?

40:18.950 --> 40:20.282
She's not dead.

40:20.318 --> 40:22.652
To kidnap someone?
Her idea.

40:22.721 --> 40:25.855
Steal money?
It was theirs, anyway.

40:25.990 --> 40:28.257
They desecrated
a dead body.

40:28.392 --> 40:30.726
And even if we can prove it,
what's that? Six months.

40:30.796 --> 40:32.228
What about him, sir?

40:32.230 --> 40:35.198
He intended to kidnap
his own wife for ransom.

40:35.267 --> 40:36.632
He called it off.

40:36.701 --> 40:39.002
The part that he planned
never happened.

40:39.137 --> 40:41.404
They can't just get
away with this.

40:41.406 --> 40:43.640
The rich get
away with murder.

40:43.775 --> 40:46.276
Or at least fake murder.

40:46.278 --> 40:48.711
You couldn't
make it up, murdoch.

40:52.784 --> 40:54.049
Mimico.

40:57.822 --> 40:59.188
Well, I told you.

40:59.191 --> 41:00.689
Told me what?

41:00.725 --> 41:02.024
That she was fine!

41:02.060 --> 41:04.193
Oh, you also
grieved her death.

41:04.262 --> 41:06.962
Yes. Well, I won't be
making that mistake twice.

41:06.998 --> 41:10.633
Now, about that money...

41:10.768 --> 41:12.401
Oh, ruthie!

41:12.471 --> 41:14.603
I just tried to have
the woman kidnapped.

41:14.639 --> 41:16.172
I can't ask her
for money now.

41:16.241 --> 41:18.040
But you called it off!

41:18.042 --> 41:19.509
And, besides,
I didn't do anything.

41:19.578 --> 41:23.112
Lucinda:
Oh, perty! Where are you?

41:31.723 --> 41:33.122
You're not dressed.

41:33.124 --> 41:35.524
We are to dine with
the fanshaws at eight.

41:35.560 --> 41:39.795
Lucy. Lulu. Come... Sit.

41:39.865 --> 41:41.264
I'm going riding.

41:41.266 --> 41:43.933
Shan't we have
a little... Chit chat?

41:43.969 --> 41:46.302
You know, to put
all that behind us?

41:49.941 --> 41:51.574
It was all
that nurse's fault.

41:51.709 --> 41:53.509
She was a temptress.

41:53.644 --> 41:55.612
I was powerless, honestly.

41:55.614 --> 41:59.949
You're aware
of my powerlessness.

42:01.253 --> 42:03.085
Indeed.

42:03.121 --> 42:06.422
How about
a tussle then? Hm?

42:07.726 --> 42:10.026
You disgust me,
rupert newsome.

42:10.028 --> 42:11.461
Ooh.

42:11.463 --> 42:14.964
Lucinda: No matter what you do,
I will never divorce you.

42:15.000 --> 42:19.635
No, I will spend every day
for the rest of my life

42:19.704 --> 42:23.506
Making you as miserable
as I possibly can.

42:33.785 --> 42:35.785
Never been here before.
What is this place?

42:35.787 --> 42:37.386
The dispensary.

42:37.455 --> 42:38.755
Never heard of it.

42:38.757 --> 42:41.590
Effie: It's a women's clinic.
Where do you go?

42:41.592 --> 42:44.460
Dr. Frick, same doctor
I've been to all my life.

42:44.462 --> 42:47.296
What about for more
intimate issues?

42:47.332 --> 42:49.698
-Like what?
-Contraceptives?

42:49.734 --> 42:52.501
Oh. Well, I-I don't...

42:52.637 --> 42:53.869
Why are we here?

42:53.905 --> 42:55.805
Because this
is how we win.

42:55.874 --> 42:56.939
What do you mean?

42:56.942 --> 42:58.741
I'm not going to waste
my life on a battle

42:58.777 --> 43:00.142
I can never win.

43:00.178 --> 43:02.078
Instead of fighting them
on their battlefield,

43:02.213 --> 43:03.546
We can build our own.

43:06.017 --> 43:07.149
Julia.

43:07.218 --> 43:08.550
What are you doing here?

43:08.587 --> 43:11.287
I wonder if it's not too late
to accept your offer?

43:11.422 --> 43:13.423
You want to work here?

43:13.425 --> 43:14.957
I do.

43:14.960 --> 43:17.760
Oh, I'm afraid we have
a line of highly qualified

43:17.895 --> 43:19.495
Female surgeons
ahead of you.

43:19.531 --> 43:22.165
[laughs]

43:22.167 --> 43:24.033
Of course
we still want you.

43:24.069 --> 43:25.635
We're desperate.

43:25.770 --> 43:28.137
But I thought you
wanted to change the world.

43:30.508 --> 43:32.174
I believe we can
do just that.
