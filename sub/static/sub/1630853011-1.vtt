WEBVTT

00:29.363 --> 00:30.698
We can do better.

00:33.400 --> 00:34.267
Again.

00:45.579 --> 00:46.446
Bye.

02:36.865 --> 02:40.494
All right, folks. Last stop.
End of the line.

08:42.957 --> 08:43.824
Hm.

10:56.457 --> 10:58.926
Yes!

11:21.115 --> 11:22.483
Hey!

11:22.516 --> 11:23.652
What're you doing?

11:23.685 --> 11:24.551
Hey!

11:28.690 --> 11:29.556
Stop!

11:33.628 --> 11:34.461
Hey!

11:37.031 --> 11:37.898
Hey!

11:49.810 --> 11:50.844
You can't just go around

11:50.878 --> 11:53.147
taking people's
things, you little...

11:57.551 --> 11:58.585
You little girl.

12:07.528 --> 12:08.829
I'm not gonna hurt you.

12:12.333 --> 12:15.936
But you need to learn how
to leave strangers alone.

12:15.969 --> 12:17.037
You understand?

12:18.872 --> 12:20.174
I'm not some charity.

12:22.409 --> 12:25.814
You need to go back to wherever
it is that you came from.

12:25.846 --> 12:26.914
Leave me alone.

12:32.920 --> 12:33.954
Good talk.

12:50.638 --> 12:51.572
Now, go on!

12:53.374 --> 12:54.241
Get!

13:44.859 --> 13:46.026
What?

13:46.059 --> 13:47.629
What? What is it?
What do you want?

13:51.064 --> 13:53.967
I told you. I'm
not gonna hurt you.

13:55.135 --> 13:57.938
But saying somethin'.
Tell me your name.

13:57.971 --> 14:00.207
Tell me why you're out
here all by yourself.

14:02.142 --> 14:04.813
Somebody's gotta
be looking for you.

14:04.846 --> 14:06.980
Where's your mommy?
Where's your daddy?

14:08.616 --> 14:09.483
Nobody?

14:11.051 --> 14:12.119
You're just here.

14:16.724 --> 14:18.325
What're you up to?

14:29.771 --> 14:31.338
Well, I can't just
leave you here.

14:36.376 --> 14:37.244
Come with me.

14:40.915 --> 14:41.982
Come on.

14:48.723 --> 14:51.291
This is what I always wanted!

15:19.253 --> 15:20.220
So what in the holy hell

15:20.254 --> 15:22.389
are you doing out
here all alone, huh?

15:24.826 --> 15:25.693
Huh?

15:26.661 --> 15:27.762
Come on, kid. Cut the silence.

15:27.795 --> 15:29.731
Say something, will
you? What's your name?

15:32.734 --> 15:33.668
Hi, I'm Jack.

15:42.042 --> 15:44.478
I bet you're pretty,
pretty thirsty, huh?

15:46.513 --> 15:47.381
Yeah.

15:48.750 --> 15:54.187
Well, I will let you have some
of the water from my canteen

15:54.221 --> 15:56.056
if you ask for it nicely.

15:58.559 --> 15:59.794
Please.

16:02.697 --> 16:04.331
That's "please", right?

16:04.364 --> 16:05.232
Yeah?

16:06.500 --> 16:07.969
Okay.

16:08.002 --> 16:09.604
I took a little sign language.

16:11.104 --> 16:13.641
Back in school, but that
was a little while ago.

16:22.750 --> 16:25.285
Let's see if we can
figure this out, huh?

16:27.187 --> 16:31.391
I was always better
at understanding

16:35.897 --> 16:37.765
So, tell me, why
don't you talk, huh?

16:39.968 --> 16:41.603
What's your name?

16:41.636 --> 16:42.704
No name.

16:42.737 --> 16:43.771
You don't have a name?

16:44.739 --> 16:45.873
Everybody's got a name.

16:56.718 --> 16:57.584
Hey.

16:58.886 --> 16:59.754
I got an idea.

17:02.489 --> 17:04.659
Why don't you come with me?

17:04.692 --> 17:05.893
Yeah.

17:05.927 --> 17:07.327
You can bring the water.

17:07.361 --> 17:10.064
I think I know something
that'll cheer you up.

17:10.098 --> 17:11.164
Hey, come on.

17:46.668 --> 17:47.567
Here, look.

17:51.072 --> 17:52.205
Watch that.

19:06.114 --> 19:07.715
Can't have you dying on me.

19:24.464 --> 19:26.701
All right, enough
of this. Come on.

19:26.734 --> 19:28.202
Let's go.

19:28.236 --> 19:29.871
You can wear that back to camp.

19:30.838 --> 19:33.440
And then I expect it
back. You understand me?

19:37.912 --> 19:38.746
Let's go.

20:02.036 --> 20:03.037
So, here's the deal.

20:04.538 --> 20:07.074
You can spend the night here
but first thing in the morning,

20:07.108 --> 20:09.309
you're gonna go back to
wherever it is you came from.

20:09.342 --> 20:10.410
You hear me?

20:11.344 --> 20:14.615
Thank you for the food.

20:16.784 --> 20:18.886
There's some
blankets over there.

20:18.920 --> 20:21.989
That tent over there is
mine. Do not come in there.

20:26.027 --> 20:26.894
Goodnight.

21:41.969 --> 21:43.503
She needed you!

21:44.571 --> 21:48.976
She needed you and
you weren't there!

21:49.010 --> 21:50.711
You were never there!

23:48.095 --> 23:48.963
Here.

23:50.464 --> 23:51.832
I'll take that back now.

23:59.306 --> 24:00.875
Let's go. We got work to do.

24:31.205 --> 24:32.572
Why would you do that?

24:32.606 --> 24:34.742
You were going to kill it!

24:34.775 --> 24:37.178
Yeah, I was gonna kill
it. That was our dinner.

24:38.946 --> 24:40.114
I'm sorry.

24:40.147 --> 24:40.614
You're sorry?

24:41.715 --> 24:45.653
Yeah, well, we'll both be
sorry with empty stomachs.

24:45.686 --> 24:47.587
Don't ever touch my gun again.

25:13.848 --> 25:15.316
She's beautiful, isn't she?

25:19.954 --> 25:20.788
Yeah.

25:22.890 --> 25:24.658
You should see
her in the winter.

25:25.893 --> 25:27.194
When she freezes over.

25:28.262 --> 25:31.532
And that ice, it's as
thick as your head.

25:31.565 --> 25:32.900
Even thicker.

25:37.771 --> 25:39.006
Good fishin', too.

26:01.028 --> 26:01.896
You like that?

26:03.831 --> 26:05.299
Yeah, why don't you try?

26:08.102 --> 26:08.969
Here.

26:16.277 --> 26:18.746
Okay. We'll figure this out.

26:19.780 --> 26:21.382
Here, another cool one.

26:23.951 --> 26:27.288
And what you wanna do,
you wanna lean way over,

26:27.321 --> 26:28.722
almost like you're fallin' over.

26:29.890 --> 26:32.459
And then you gotta, you
gotta, snap, snap your wrist.

26:37.565 --> 26:38.832
Yeah.

26:40.568 --> 26:41.435
Yeah.

26:49.476 --> 26:50.344
Aria.

26:54.683 --> 26:56.183
You know what that is?

27:01.522 --> 27:03.224
It's a song that stands alone.

27:07.428 --> 27:08.462
But it holds its own.

27:11.899 --> 27:13.167
It's untouchable.

27:20.040 --> 27:21.442
You remind me of an Aria.

27:24.445 --> 27:25.946
Do you mind if I call you that?

27:27.848 --> 27:29.583
I mean, I've gotta
call you somethin'.

27:29.618 --> 27:32.186
It's beautiful.

27:33.622 --> 27:35.456
It suits you.

27:40.729 --> 27:42.062
Wait.

27:42.096 --> 27:43.030
Aria, wait!

27:48.836 --> 27:51.673
You can't run from me, maggot!

27:51.706 --> 27:53.708
I'll find you!

27:56.877 --> 27:59.046
I gave you both everything.

27:59.079 --> 28:01.115
I even bought the
little maggot braces

28:01.148 --> 28:03.017
to fix her disgusting teeth.

28:03.050 --> 28:04.318
Do you know how
much that cost me?

28:04.351 --> 28:06.755
Do you have any idea
how much that cost me?

28:06.787 --> 28:07.988
I don't understand.

28:08.022 --> 28:11.525
Oh, stop your deaf
wavin'. Get out of my way.

28:11.558 --> 28:15.262
I'm gonna teach you what
it's like to disrespect me.

28:20.735 --> 28:23.237
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

28:25.239 --> 28:26.106
It's me.

28:26.807 --> 28:27.875
Jack.

28:34.114 --> 28:34.982
It's okay.

28:35.949 --> 28:37.619
It's okay.

28:37.652 --> 28:39.186
It was just a tree.

28:40.254 --> 28:42.156
What did you think
it was anyway?

28:44.391 --> 28:45.926
He's coming.

28:45.959 --> 28:47.127
Who's coming?

28:47.161 --> 28:49.631
Big Al.

28:49.664 --> 28:50.564
Who's Big Al?

29:22.697 --> 29:25.532
You really are a vindictive
bastard, you know that?

29:29.169 --> 29:30.404
Yeah.

29:30.437 --> 29:31.305
You.

29:32.774 --> 29:33.641
Wherever you are.

29:38.045 --> 29:39.980
This doesn't change anything.

29:42.049 --> 29:43.317
I hope you know that.

29:59.032 --> 30:01.235
Why do I even waste
my time with you?

30:07.474 --> 30:08.475
You're a joke.

30:27.428 --> 30:28.295
Hey.

30:29.496 --> 30:31.965
Come on.

30:37.739 --> 30:38.606
It's okay.

30:47.615 --> 30:48.449
In there.

30:50.117 --> 30:51.552
Get some sleep.

31:14.742 --> 31:15.610
Hm.

32:05.359 --> 32:07.094
You were shaking like a leaf.

32:08.595 --> 32:09.764
Don't get used to it.

32:11.431 --> 32:13.033
Fish?

32:13.735 --> 32:14.268
Yeah.

32:15.269 --> 32:18.773
I couldn't sleep, so I
went and caught these.

32:18.806 --> 32:19.807
Hope you like fish.

32:21.609 --> 32:25.013
Mama and I used to fish.

32:26.714 --> 32:27.581
Yeah.

32:32.052 --> 32:33.821
I bet she misses
you so much, huh?

32:36.356 --> 32:37.759
Mama...

32:37.792 --> 32:39.761
she died.

32:43.698 --> 32:45.065
I'm sorry.

32:45.098 --> 32:47.902
I miss her.

32:47.936 --> 32:48.803
Yeah.

32:52.674 --> 32:53.942
What about your daddy?

32:53.975 --> 32:55.442
I bet he can't wait
to see you. He's...

32:55.475 --> 32:57.612
He killed her!

32:57.645 --> 32:59.513
He killed Mama!

33:14.127 --> 33:15.195
Aria?

33:19.000 --> 33:20.935
Is your daddy looking for you?

33:20.969 --> 33:22.336
Is that why you're up here?

33:24.471 --> 33:25.339
What happened?

33:26.774 --> 33:29.109
You don't have to tell
me if you don't wanna.

33:30.812 --> 33:34.247
I had to save Mama.

33:37.652 --> 33:40.187
You are both gonna
learn to respect me!

33:43.958 --> 33:45.258
Are you listening?

33:45.292 --> 33:47.294
Oh, that's right. You can't.

33:47.327 --> 33:51.465
Because you're a stupid,
deaf waste of space.

33:51.498 --> 33:53.166
Stay quiet.

33:53.200 --> 33:54.434
What're you telling her?

33:54.468 --> 33:56.904
Hey, what're you telling her?

33:56.938 --> 33:58.271
What're you telling her?

33:58.305 --> 33:59.306
What are you telling her?

34:06.848 --> 34:07.982
I'm gonna kill you.

34:39.379 --> 34:41.816
You need to run!

34:41.849 --> 34:43.885
Never stop! Never come back!

34:43.918 --> 34:44.952
Never.

34:47.587 --> 34:49.489
Come with me.

34:50.758 --> 34:52.827
He'll catch us both.

34:57.131 --> 34:58.565
I love you.

34:58.598 --> 34:59.967
I love you too.

35:11.612 --> 35:13.413
I should've done
that years ago.

35:18.086 --> 35:20.888
You can't run from me, maggot!

35:20.922 --> 35:22.222
I'll find you!

35:34.736 --> 35:35.603
Shh.

35:37.739 --> 35:39.506
You're safe now.

35:39.539 --> 35:40.407
Okay?

35:41.274 --> 35:42.944
I'm scared!

35:42.977 --> 35:44.578
I know. It's okay.

35:46.013 --> 35:47.815
You can stay with me.

35:48.515 --> 35:50.584
I won't send you away.

35:51.251 --> 35:53.553
Okay?

35:53.587 --> 35:55.923
I won't send you anywhere.

36:12.506 --> 36:14.842
She's been out
there about a week.

36:14.876 --> 36:16.611
Think if we go back
where I killed her mama,

36:16.644 --> 36:18.613
we'll pick up a
trail from there.

36:19.446 --> 36:21.115
She's probably
dead, all right?

36:21.149 --> 36:22.315
And you don't look
like you're in

36:22.349 --> 36:24.218
the best shape of your
life right now, either.

36:24.252 --> 36:25.485
Are you questioning
me, baby brother?

36:25.519 --> 36:27.121
- You wanna run things now?
- No, Al.

36:27.155 --> 36:28.756
Roy, she saw what I did,

36:28.790 --> 36:30.825
and that could come
back on all of us.

36:30.858 --> 36:32.526
She can't even speak.

36:32.559 --> 36:35.029
You know, you are an
idiot, Roy. You know that?

36:35.062 --> 36:36.329
She can talk, believe me.

36:36.363 --> 36:37.799
Oh, really? You
ever heard her?

36:37.832 --> 36:39.366
No, but I know she can.

36:40.534 --> 36:42.536
Stop your crying and gear up.

36:42.569 --> 36:45.740
She's out there by
herself. We'll find her.

36:45.773 --> 36:49.442
It's gonna take more than a
little maggot to kill Big Al.

36:49.476 --> 36:51.012
- Go!
- All right.

36:51.045 --> 36:51.879
- Go!
- All right!

36:51.913 --> 36:53.881
You two, get in the back!

36:55.750 --> 36:56.617
Come on!

37:28.616 --> 37:30.785
Yeah! That was
an awesome cast.

37:30.818 --> 37:33.020
Okay, now what you wanna do
is you wanna let that worm

37:33.054 --> 37:34.722
sink all the way to the bottom,

37:34.755 --> 37:36.157
'cause that's
where the fish are,

37:36.190 --> 37:39.260
and that's what we wanna
catch, 'cause we're hungry.

37:39.293 --> 37:42.263
So once the line stops moving,
that means it's on the bottom

37:42.296 --> 37:43.530
and at that point,

37:43.563 --> 37:46.566
that's when you wanna
start to slowly reel it in.

37:46.600 --> 37:47.400
Not yet.

37:48.202 --> 37:50.171
So after you start
reeling it in,

37:50.204 --> 37:54.507
you're gonna wait for a
tug, 'cause that's the fish,

37:54.541 --> 37:58.246
and then you wanna yank it
back and catch the fish!

37:58.279 --> 38:00.181
And I want you to reel
that fish in, okay?

38:00.214 --> 38:01.616
Yeah!

38:01.649 --> 38:04.384
So go ahead and start to reel
it and when you feel that tug,

38:04.417 --> 38:06.821
that's the fish and...

38:18.933 --> 38:19.800
It's okay.

38:21.335 --> 38:22.670
There's a learning curve.

38:23.436 --> 38:24.504
All right?

38:30.778 --> 38:32.013
What?

38:32.046 --> 38:32.914
I...

38:34.581 --> 38:35.917
Why are you splashing yourself?

38:35.950 --> 38:38.653
What're you doing? No, you're
gonna scare the fish away!

38:38.686 --> 38:39.921
Look, you scared the fish away!

38:39.954 --> 38:42.023
That, that's on you.

38:42.056 --> 38:42.690
No!

38:42.723 --> 38:44.524
No, look. Here, hold this.

38:44.557 --> 38:45.793
I'm gonna get a fish.

38:47.895 --> 38:50.197
You're so silly!

38:51.332 --> 38:53.634
Why did you fall for
that? You're out.

38:53.668 --> 38:56.737
Oh, my god.

39:05.445 --> 39:07.514
Tonight, we feast.

39:08.983 --> 39:11.118
I want the fat one.

39:12.053 --> 39:12.920
As you should.

39:13.754 --> 39:17.024
For he who geets it, eats it.

39:18.893 --> 39:20.094
Hm.

39:20.127 --> 39:21.295
Okay.

39:21.329 --> 39:22.797
You did not like that one.

39:24.464 --> 39:25.498
Okay.

39:25.532 --> 39:26.801
No dad jokes.

40:02.903 --> 40:03.771
It's for you.

40:04.638 --> 40:05.740
It's a little big.

40:06.774 --> 40:08.909
You know, but I think
you'll grow into it.

40:11.045 --> 40:12.113
I mean, you can't stay

40:12.146 --> 40:13.848
in those dirty things
forever, you know?

40:17.485 --> 40:18.551
Besides...

40:20.254 --> 40:23.024
You smell really bad.

40:23.824 --> 40:26.827
Thank you, it's beautiful.

40:31.598 --> 40:35.002
I don't know about
all that, but, uh...

40:36.370 --> 40:38.305
Here you go. Try it on.

40:46.013 --> 40:46.881
Go ahead.

41:39.567 --> 41:40.167
Wow.

41:41.535 --> 41:45.106
How did I miss a little princess
dance right into my camp?

41:47.274 --> 41:48.142
Do you like it?

41:51.479 --> 41:52.313
Good. I'm glad.

42:08.729 --> 42:12.233
What's that?

42:12.266 --> 42:15.169
Oh, it's nothin', it's just...

42:15.202 --> 42:17.171
It's just something
I wear, that's all.

42:18.472 --> 42:20.307
Did someone give it to you?

42:20.341 --> 42:22.576
I don't really wanna
talk about it, all right?

42:22.611 --> 42:24.245
Can I try it on?

42:24.278 --> 42:25.146
No!

42:38.459 --> 42:39.927
Aria, I'm sorry.

42:41.028 --> 42:43.297
I shouldn't yell
at you, I just...

42:44.398 --> 42:46.867
It's just not something
I talk about, all right?

42:50.004 --> 42:53.307
Did it belong to
someone special?

42:53.340 --> 42:54.208
Yeah.

42:56.110 --> 42:56.977
Very special.

43:01.215 --> 43:05.452
Too special for the likes
of me. That's for sure.

43:12.627 --> 43:15.262
But enough about
this old grump, huh?

43:17.831 --> 43:19.366
Let's grill some fish, yeah?

44:01.542 --> 44:02.843
Al, Al, Al, Al!

44:02.876 --> 44:04.578
Al, Al, stop!

44:04.613 --> 44:05.746
I see it.

44:14.755 --> 44:16.790
- Is it hers?
- Yeah, it is.

44:16.824 --> 44:18.058
Give me that.

44:20.261 --> 44:22.930
Looks like she went
up the mountain.

44:22.963 --> 44:27.167
So, we're gonna have to
hoof it from here. Let's go.

45:27.428 --> 45:28.730
Dad.

45:28.763 --> 45:31.832
I'm sorry, honey.
I didn't mean to spy.

45:35.169 --> 45:36.904
Sorry I took your notebook.

45:38.038 --> 45:39.840
I was going to put it back.

45:43.243 --> 45:46.614
You know, some of my
best work is in that book.

45:46.648 --> 45:49.583
I would appreciate it if you
asked me next time, okay?

45:52.486 --> 45:53.354
Well...

45:54.823 --> 45:56.791
What did you think?

45:56.825 --> 46:01.462
I think that with some more
practice, you can do better.

46:28.757 --> 46:31.492
Sorry, I woke you.

46:34.995 --> 46:36.163
It's okay.

46:37.832 --> 46:39.433
I was just having a bad dream.

46:47.274 --> 46:50.210
What do you say we go on
a little adventure today?

46:50.244 --> 46:51.111
Yeah?

46:54.148 --> 46:55.015
Yeah.

47:33.922 --> 47:34.988
Hey.

47:36.089 --> 47:37.692
You ever fly in a plane before?

47:40.160 --> 47:41.261
Would you like to?

47:43.297 --> 47:44.164
Yeah?

47:45.499 --> 47:46.433
Hold that thought.

47:56.577 --> 47:59.279
Well, I don't exactly
have a plane, but uh,

48:00.581 --> 48:01.582
we could still fly.

48:12.559 --> 48:13.928
'Ay.

48:13.962 --> 48:15.195
No peakin'.

48:47.127 --> 48:49.697
Captain, prepare for takeoff.

48:52.667 --> 48:57.672
Oh!

48:59.741 --> 49:01.575
What're you laughing at?

49:01.609 --> 49:03.912
Can I try

49:03.945 --> 49:05.279
You wanna try?

49:10.484 --> 49:11.552
Absolutely. Here.

49:45.118 --> 49:46.654
A lot further than mine did.

49:59.099 --> 50:00.233
Wanna do some more?

50:01.002 --> 50:02.436
Yeah.

50:02.469 --> 50:03.337
Me too.

52:00.154 --> 52:04.192
Thank you for
teaching me how to fly.

52:07.695 --> 52:08.896
You're welcome.

52:28.315 --> 52:29.817
It belonged to my daughter.

52:32.987 --> 52:34.454
The necklace.

52:44.364 --> 52:46.566
It's the only thing
I have left of hers.

52:58.212 --> 52:59.914
I wasn't there for her.

53:07.021 --> 53:07.989
In the end...

53:10.858 --> 53:11.926
I let her die...

53:14.796 --> 53:15.696
All alone.

53:18.365 --> 53:19.533
I wasn't there.

53:22.737 --> 53:26.140
My little
girl died alone.

53:28.943 --> 53:32.445
Without her daddy.

53:47.929 --> 53:48.930
Let's finish strong.

54:00.107 --> 54:01.776
Hey, Dad.

54:01.809 --> 54:02.677
I'm still here.

54:03.376 --> 54:05.079
Where are you?

54:05.112 --> 54:06.379
Call me back.

54:17.658 --> 54:19.492
- Hey, sweetie.
- Hi.

54:19.526 --> 54:20.695
Is he coming?

54:20.728 --> 54:22.296
I'm sure he'll be here soon.

54:22.330 --> 54:23.396
Okay.

54:24.298 --> 54:27.068
Okay.

55:09.010 --> 55:10.278
Hey, Mom.

55:10.311 --> 55:13.915
I can't get through to Dad
and you're not picking up.

55:13.948 --> 55:17.151
I'm walking home.
I'll see you soon.

55:29.864 --> 55:30.731
Hey, Mom.

55:34.902 --> 55:38.538
Yeah, surprise-surprise. His
dress rehearsal went late.

55:40.174 --> 55:41.441
I don't know.

55:43.210 --> 55:44.679
I'm almost home.

57:22.542 --> 57:23.677
Jack.

57:23.711 --> 57:25.913
Well done. I am very pleased.

57:25.946 --> 57:28.382
Congratulations. It's
gonna be a huge success.

57:28.416 --> 57:31.285
Looking forward to it.

57:31.318 --> 57:32.686
Hi, baby. I'm on my way.

57:34.288 --> 57:35.256
Hello, who is this?

57:37.058 --> 57:37.892
Yeah?

57:40.995 --> 57:41.862
What?

58:19.667 --> 58:22.236
It was my fault Mama died.

58:23.170 --> 58:26.173
Don't say that. That's
not what happened.

58:26.207 --> 58:28.576
Mama tried to save me.

58:28.609 --> 58:30.344
I was too heavy.

58:30.377 --> 58:31.512
She had to set me down.

58:31.545 --> 58:33.614
That's not what happened.

58:35.349 --> 58:38.018
Bad things happen
to good people.

58:42.857 --> 58:45.726
That doesn't mean
that it's their fault.

58:50.631 --> 58:51.699
Okay?

58:53.300 --> 58:54.335
It wasn't your fault.

58:55.970 --> 58:59.907
What was your daughter's name?

59:04.545 --> 59:05.880
Melody.

59:13.387 --> 59:14.722
Her name was Melody.

59:21.630 --> 59:24.298
That is a beautiful name.

59:32.607 --> 59:34.275
That's a beautiful
thing to say.

1:00:08.475 --> 1:00:09.343
Look out.

1:00:10.211 --> 1:00:11.579
No!

1:00:11.613 --> 1:00:12.980
You wanna let her
know we're comin'?

1:00:13.013 --> 1:00:14.248
I thought I saw something!

1:00:14.281 --> 1:00:17.218
Listen to me. Let
me do the thinking.

1:00:17.251 --> 1:00:18.719
You do somethin'
stupid like that again,

1:00:18.752 --> 1:00:21.088
I'm gonna put a
bullet in your head.

1:00:21.121 --> 1:00:23.424
Al, knock it off, all right?
He was just trying to help.

1:00:23.457 --> 1:00:25.459
Shut up, Roy. I don't
care if you're my brother.

1:00:25.492 --> 1:00:28.162
Let me get somethin' straight
here with all you. Look at me.

1:00:28.195 --> 1:00:30.632
I got enough bullets for
each and every one of you.

1:00:30.665 --> 1:00:32.299
Let's go!

1:00:32.333 --> 1:00:34.268
Go. Don't give me that look.

1:00:34.301 --> 1:00:37.371
- I saw somethin'!
- Put the gun down and go!

1:00:37.404 --> 1:00:38.272
Gun down!

1:00:56.824 --> 1:00:58.792
What was that?

1:00:58.826 --> 1:01:00.629
It's probably nothin'.

1:01:04.733 --> 1:01:07.534
That storm's gonna
be on us soon.

1:01:07.568 --> 1:01:09.036
We better pick up the pace.

1:01:10.504 --> 1:01:11.372
Come on.

1:01:25.252 --> 1:01:26.487
Oh!

1:01:27.821 --> 1:01:29.890
We were almost stuck
in that one, huh?

1:01:32.026 --> 1:01:32.893
Ah!

1:01:33.894 --> 1:01:35.362
It's really coming down.

1:01:37.331 --> 1:01:38.667
Wow.

1:01:43.837 --> 1:01:47.074
Are you scared of
a little rainstorm?

1:01:49.543 --> 1:01:50.144
It's okay.

1:01:51.278 --> 1:01:55.916
It's not that bad, 'cause
it's still quite a ways off.

1:01:58.753 --> 1:02:00.454
Wanna know how I know that?

1:02:02.791 --> 1:02:05.794
You see, it's in the time
between the lightning

1:02:05.826 --> 1:02:07.027
and the thunder.

1:02:08.062 --> 1:02:09.963
I'll show you, okay?

1:02:17.371 --> 1:02:19.306
It's three kilometers.

1:02:19.340 --> 1:02:20.608
It's pretty far.

1:02:22.309 --> 1:02:23.177
You try.

1:02:31.885 --> 1:02:34.888
Three kilometers.

1:02:34.922 --> 1:02:36.490
Three kilometers.

1:02:36.523 --> 1:02:38.392
That's like two miles.

1:02:38.425 --> 1:02:39.526
That's far, right?

1:02:42.764 --> 1:02:46.133
It's not so scary when you
look at it that way, you know?

1:03:03.550 --> 1:03:04.418
Aria?

1:03:05.687 --> 1:03:07.388
Can I ask you a question?

1:03:09.390 --> 1:03:10.324
It's about Big Al.

1:03:13.060 --> 1:03:16.463
Do you think that he has
any big scary friends

1:03:16.497 --> 1:03:20.534
that would help him if he
asked them if he needed them?

1:03:23.570 --> 1:03:26.306
My uncle, Roy.

1:03:26.340 --> 1:03:28.942
He never hurt us,

1:03:28.976 --> 1:03:32.513
but he never stopped Big Al.

1:03:32.546 --> 1:03:33.414
Uh-huh?

1:03:34.248 --> 1:03:36.083
Is there anybody
else, you think?

1:03:36.818 --> 1:03:38.820
There are two.

1:03:38.853 --> 1:03:39.821
Two of 'em.

1:03:39.854 --> 1:03:42.423
The first one is really tall.

1:03:42.456 --> 1:03:44.992
His name is Bo.

1:03:45.827 --> 1:03:49.329
The second one is shorter.

1:03:50.030 --> 1:03:52.499
I don't remember his name.

1:03:52.533 --> 1:03:56.003
But he has black hair.

1:03:58.138 --> 1:04:02.911
Mama called them the silent two.

1:04:02.943 --> 1:04:05.647
They don't say much,

1:04:05.680 --> 1:04:08.015
but if people don't pay,

1:04:08.048 --> 1:04:10.484
they hurt them.

1:04:12.486 --> 1:04:16.891
Do you think they
are coming to get me?

1:04:16.925 --> 1:04:18.192
Yeah.

1:04:18.225 --> 1:04:21.528
Well, I'm a big believer
in looking at things

1:04:21.562 --> 1:04:25.599
the way that they really are
and I'm not gonna lie to you.

1:04:29.570 --> 1:04:31.505
I think they're coming.

1:04:32.573 --> 1:04:36.510
But if they are, they
haven't found us yet.

1:04:36.543 --> 1:04:38.979
And they're probably
real far away still.

1:04:41.148 --> 1:04:44.652
But if they do find us,
and they may never find us,

1:04:44.686 --> 1:04:47.956
but if they do, I need
to be ready, you know?

1:04:47.988 --> 1:04:50.457
What do you mean, ready?

1:04:53.360 --> 1:04:55.195
I will never
let them take you.

1:04:56.163 --> 1:04:59.566
But they have guns.

1:05:00.802 --> 1:05:02.069
You're probably right.

1:05:03.403 --> 1:05:06.406
But I have something
that they don't have.

1:05:06.440 --> 1:05:08.108
What?

1:05:09.644 --> 1:05:10.477
You.

1:05:12.780 --> 1:05:14.348
And you're worth fighting for.

1:05:16.718 --> 1:05:18.252
I'm scared.

1:05:18.285 --> 1:05:20.387
I know. I know you're scared.

1:05:23.156 --> 1:05:25.627
But courage isn't
about not being afraid.

1:05:27.094 --> 1:05:30.197
It's about being afraid and
still doing something about it.

1:05:33.635 --> 1:05:36.336
I don't feel brave.

1:05:38.305 --> 1:05:41.108
That's the funny
thing about bravery.

1:05:41.141 --> 1:05:45.512
Oftentimes, the brave ones
don't know that they are,

1:05:45.546 --> 1:05:47.080
until they have to be.

1:05:48.081 --> 1:05:49.784
But just know this.

1:05:50.785 --> 1:05:52.419
If they're looking for us,

1:05:52.452 --> 1:05:55.188
and they find us and
they try and take you,

1:05:56.891 --> 1:05:58.626
I will kill them all.

1:06:00.561 --> 1:06:02.362
You promise?

1:06:04.431 --> 1:06:05.299
I promise.

1:06:12.139 --> 1:06:13.641
I mean it with all my heart.

1:06:20.915 --> 1:06:22.750
Yeah. Brave.

1:06:22.784 --> 1:06:24.384
Brave.

1:06:33.795 --> 1:06:35.029
Hm.

1:06:50.143 --> 1:06:51.211
Hey, you.

1:06:54.716 --> 1:06:55.850
It's me again.

1:06:59.519 --> 1:07:02.122
Sorry about calling you
a vindictive bastard.

1:07:04.959 --> 1:07:06.126
But I need a favor.

1:07:11.131 --> 1:07:12.634
I know I don't deserve one.

1:07:16.037 --> 1:07:17.772
But I'm
gonna ask anyway.

1:07:30.785 --> 1:07:31.886
I'll wait to use this,

1:07:36.156 --> 1:07:38.258
if you help me keep her safe.

1:07:51.571 --> 1:07:54.408
But if anything happens to her,

1:07:54.441 --> 1:07:57.511
if she dies, I swear...

1:07:59.279 --> 1:08:00.480
I swear I'll use it.

1:08:01.849 --> 1:08:02.784
You understand me?

1:08:08.455 --> 1:08:09.724
I may already be dead,

1:08:13.560 --> 1:08:16.764
but if I'm not, no
more hesitation.

1:08:19.067 --> 1:08:20.500
This little game is over.

1:08:31.411 --> 1:08:33.280
I know you don't care about me,

1:08:35.717 --> 1:08:36.818
or what happens to me.

1:08:39.453 --> 1:08:40.955
Maybe you're not even there.

1:08:45.827 --> 1:08:47.561
But if you're there, God,

1:08:50.131 --> 1:08:51.766
show me what to do.

1:08:55.602 --> 1:08:56.938
Show me, please.

1:09:24.665 --> 1:09:26.033
There I go again.

1:09:27.501 --> 1:09:28.669
Talking to the sky.

1:09:33.040 --> 1:09:35.943
You'd think I'd have learned
my lesson by now, right?

1:11:28.823 --> 1:11:30.725
Al, I found her trail!

1:11:37.098 --> 1:11:38.498
What's wrong?

1:12:01.588 --> 1:12:03.523
Over here! I found her!

1:12:03.556 --> 1:12:05.226
Where?

1:12:05.259 --> 1:12:06.994
Over here!

1:12:09.529 --> 1:12:11.632
Step where I step, okay?

1:12:11.666 --> 1:12:14.402
Over here, over here!

1:12:14.434 --> 1:12:16.469
You find a friend, maggot?

1:12:16.503 --> 1:12:17.772
He's not gonna save you.

1:12:17.805 --> 1:12:19.273
Go get her.

1:12:19.307 --> 1:12:20.808
Come on.

1:12:47.134 --> 1:12:48.369
No, no!

1:12:48.402 --> 1:12:49.469
No!

1:12:57.945 --> 1:13:01.048
Well, she went and
found herself a protector.

1:13:01.082 --> 1:13:04.385
I don't know, Al.
This is dangerous.

1:13:04.418 --> 1:13:06.354
This guy knows this
place better than we do,

1:13:06.387 --> 1:13:08.055
and he's expecting us.

1:13:08.089 --> 1:13:11.558
Four of us, one of
him. Do the math, Roy.

1:13:12.592 --> 1:13:13.995
You, get up.

1:13:15.329 --> 1:13:17.164
It went
through my leg, Al!

1:13:17.198 --> 1:13:19.734
I need to get to a hospital!

1:13:19.767 --> 1:13:23.137
Hey, the only way we're
leaving this mountain

1:13:23.170 --> 1:13:24.271
is with the maggot.

1:13:26.173 --> 1:13:27.174
She's mine.

1:13:36.117 --> 1:13:37.550
Come here, come here.

1:13:37.584 --> 1:13:40.721
Hurry up there.
Go, go, go, go, go.

1:13:45.226 --> 1:13:46.093
Let's go.

1:14:08.716 --> 1:14:10.785
It's all clear.

1:14:29.470 --> 1:14:31.105
Al. Listen, I'm telling you.

1:14:31.138 --> 1:14:34.942
We need to go back, man. This
guy's prepared for this, okay?

1:14:34.975 --> 1:14:35.843
No!

1:14:37.344 --> 1:14:39.713
He dies tonight.

1:14:39.747 --> 1:14:42.383
You're speaking
my language now.

1:14:42.416 --> 1:14:43.984
We better get off this trail.

1:14:51.759 --> 1:14:53.627
Come here, baby. Come here.

1:14:55.096 --> 1:14:57.998
Get down, get down. I need
you to stay here, okay?

1:14:58.032 --> 1:15:00.901
If we're gonna stand a chance,
I'm gonna need to use this,

1:15:00.935 --> 1:15:03.804
and I cannot risk hitting
you in the crossfire, okay?

1:15:03.838 --> 1:15:06.507
I don't want you to die!

1:15:06.540 --> 1:15:07.341
I know you're scared,

1:15:08.609 --> 1:15:11.078
but I made a promise that
I intend to keep, okay?

1:15:13.013 --> 1:15:13.881
Remember.

1:15:16.016 --> 1:15:16.884
We are brave.

1:15:18.185 --> 1:15:19.053
Brave.

1:15:19.954 --> 1:15:20.821
Yeah.

1:15:42.243 --> 1:15:43.110
Please.

1:15:44.011 --> 1:15:44.879
Let me save her.

1:15:46.080 --> 1:15:46.947
Please.

1:16:06.133 --> 1:16:07.001
Aria!

1:16:18.546 --> 1:16:19.780
Come on out!

1:16:21.749 --> 1:16:24.151
Come on out and
put the rifle down!

1:16:25.953 --> 1:16:27.855
I know you're out there, mister!

1:16:28.689 --> 1:16:29.757
Just put it down!

1:16:32.293 --> 1:16:34.962
You better stop playing
with me, mister!

1:16:36.597 --> 1:16:37.298
I'll kill her!

1:16:38.399 --> 1:16:40.734
Put down your
weapons and walk away!

1:16:41.936 --> 1:16:43.337
Why would we do that?

1:16:43.370 --> 1:16:46.473
'Cause if you don't, I'll
kill every single one of you!

1:16:46.507 --> 1:16:48.576
Don't move! Don't move!

1:16:48.610 --> 1:16:49.611
Go. Go ahead!

1:16:49.644 --> 1:16:51.478
I'll put you down
for good this time.

1:16:54.481 --> 1:16:57.451
Don't play with me, mister.
You shoot me, she falls.

1:16:59.353 --> 1:17:01.088
Is that what you want?

1:17:01.121 --> 1:17:03.123
Is that what you
want? You want this?

1:17:03.157 --> 1:17:04.425
No, no!

1:17:04.458 --> 1:17:06.260
Okay, okay, okay!

1:17:06.293 --> 1:17:07.795
- Now.
- Okay.

1:17:07.828 --> 1:17:09.430
Don't hurt her.

1:17:09.463 --> 1:17:10.331
Please.

1:17:12.399 --> 1:17:13.434
Please.

1:17:13.467 --> 1:17:14.868
I'm putting the gun down.

1:17:16.136 --> 1:17:17.271
It's okay.

1:17:17.304 --> 1:17:18.472
I'm putting the gun down.

1:17:20.374 --> 1:17:21.242
Okay.

1:17:23.577 --> 1:17:25.980
Boy, that was
stupid. Take her, Roy.

1:17:30.818 --> 1:17:32.086
Get her, get her.

1:17:33.020 --> 1:17:33.887
Aria.

1:17:34.555 --> 1:17:36.056
Why?

1:17:36.090 --> 1:17:37.558
All this?

1:17:37.591 --> 1:17:39.860
She's less than nothing.

1:17:39.893 --> 1:17:41.996
Why would you choose
death for her?

1:17:44.598 --> 1:17:45.833
What've you got here?

1:17:45.866 --> 1:17:47.901
Oh. Well...

1:17:48.802 --> 1:17:50.437
Oh! I like this.

1:17:51.538 --> 1:17:53.507
You know, I always
wanted one of these.

1:17:54.676 --> 1:17:55.476
You know she stabbed me?

1:17:56.944 --> 1:18:00.514
I didn't think she had it in
her but that maggot stabbed me.

1:18:00.547 --> 1:18:02.950
She stabbed me right about...

1:18:02.983 --> 1:18:05.486
Here!

1:18:10.524 --> 1:18:11.292
Now you're gonna know

1:18:12.526 --> 1:18:16.563
that maggot will only
bring you pain and death.

1:18:16.597 --> 1:18:17.464
Look at me!

1:18:18.399 --> 1:18:19.967
You're gonna die.

1:18:20.000 --> 1:18:22.536
You're gonna die knowing
it was all for nothing.

1:18:23.971 --> 1:18:25.873
Her name is Aria.

1:18:25.906 --> 1:18:28.042
What did you say to me?

1:18:31.011 --> 1:18:32.913
Her name is Aria.

1:18:35.015 --> 1:18:37.851
Kill him!

1:18:43.157 --> 1:18:44.191
That's it.

1:18:44.224 --> 1:18:45.092
Jack!

1:18:47.261 --> 1:18:48.395
Don't hurt him!

1:18:49.496 --> 1:18:51.532
Surprise-surprise.

1:18:51.565 --> 1:18:53.233
It finally speaks.

1:18:54.736 --> 1:18:55.602
Get her.

1:18:57.004 --> 1:18:58.272
Come here, come here.

1:18:58.305 --> 1:18:59.306
No!

1:19:01.375 --> 1:19:03.110
You stay right there.

1:19:03.143 --> 1:19:06.046
They say when you're
on your way out,

1:19:06.080 --> 1:19:08.382
you go into a big
tunnel of light.

1:19:08.415 --> 1:19:10.851
I always wanted to
know if that's true.

1:19:10.884 --> 1:19:13.020
So, do me a favor
and tell me. Yeah?

1:19:14.555 --> 1:19:16.123
Nice necklace.

1:19:22.630 --> 1:19:23.765
That's it.

1:19:23.798 --> 1:19:24.998
There ya go.

1:19:26.533 --> 1:19:28.268
I got you. I got you.

1:19:29.804 --> 1:19:32.373
There you go. There you go.

1:19:39.748 --> 1:19:42.015
Jack!

1:19:42.049 --> 1:19:45.486
Look at him! You're
the one that did this.

1:19:45.519 --> 1:19:48.055
You're the one that did this!

1:19:48.823 --> 1:19:50.124
Let's go. Come on.

1:19:52.459 --> 1:19:53.327
Go.

1:19:57.464 --> 1:19:58.399
Cut it out.

1:22:43.530 --> 1:22:44.464
Who are you?

1:22:45.599 --> 1:22:46.634
Drop the rifle!

1:22:47.534 --> 1:22:48.903
Do it!

1:22:48.937 --> 1:22:50.070
I'll kill her!

1:22:51.271 --> 1:22:53.473
Do what I tell ya, mister!

1:22:53.507 --> 1:22:54.374
Do it!

1:22:56.410 --> 1:22:57.277
Come on!

1:23:05.218 --> 1:23:06.821
You kill my men, huh?

1:23:06.854 --> 1:23:08.522
You kill my brother?

1:23:08.555 --> 1:23:09.958
For what? This?

1:23:09.991 --> 1:23:11.626
This little maggot?

1:23:11.659 --> 1:23:13.061
Why?

1:23:13.093 --> 1:23:15.663
She doesn't even have a name!

1:23:17.397 --> 1:23:18.298
You

1:23:18.332 --> 1:23:19.433
What're you telling her?

1:23:19.466 --> 1:23:22.003
are brave.

1:24:01.174 --> 1:24:03.011
This isn't over.

1:24:03.044 --> 1:24:05.479
She doesn't get to walk away!

1:24:07.147 --> 1:24:08.248
What're you doing?

1:24:08.281 --> 1:24:09.917
No, no! Wait, wait!

1:24:11.251 --> 1:24:14.656
I've got money. I'll let her go!

1:24:14.689 --> 1:24:15.823
No, wait, wait, wait!

1:26:08.002 --> 1:26:10.403
It's beautiful, isn't it?

1:26:11.672 --> 1:26:13.674
The view?

1:26:16.177 --> 1:26:17.011
No.

1:26:17.044 --> 1:26:17.912
Life.

1:26:20.480 --> 1:26:21.883
I'd almost forgotten.

1:26:26.187 --> 1:26:27.789
Me too.

1:26:33.027 --> 1:26:35.229
I'll go start packing up camp.

1:26:35.263 --> 1:26:36.463
Okay.

1:27:08.896 --> 1:27:09.897
Thank you.
