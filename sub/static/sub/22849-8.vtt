"HELL IS EMPTY AND ALL THE DEVILS
ARE HERE!" WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE

01:21.166 --> 01:23.291
Thanks for coming over so quickly, Egon.

01:24.916 --> 01:27.583
The workers found
these two corpses this morning.

01:34.208 --> 01:35.583
They're still children.

01:35.666 --> 01:38.541
Strange. It's as if someone
dressed them in costumes.

01:40.708 --> 01:41.541
Oh, God...

01:56.083 --> 02:01.375
AN IMPORTANT INVESTMENT
NUCLEAR POWER FOR EVERY HOUSEHOLD!

03:29.916 --> 03:34.583
AS YOU SOW, SO YOU SHALL REAP

03:44.208 --> 03:46.416
On time, like a clockwork.

03:53.250 --> 03:55.208
Where were we?

03:56.125 --> 03:57.833
The Einstein-Rosen bridge.

03:59.250 --> 04:01.000
A passage...

04:01.083 --> 04:03.625
between a black hole, the entry,

04:03.708 --> 04:06.416
and a white hole, the exit, which...

04:07.541 --> 04:11.583
connects time and space.

04:12.750 --> 04:15.416
To pass through it
is to travel through time.

04:16.791 --> 04:17.708
Tick-tock.

05:10.000 --> 05:13.500
Our thinking is shaped by dualism.

05:14.541 --> 05:17.875
Entrance, exit. Black, white. Good, evil.

05:17.958 --> 05:21.250
Everything appears as opposite pairs.

05:22.750 --> 05:24.208
But that's wrong.

05:27.125 --> 05:30.208
Have you ever heard of the triquetra?

05:31.083 --> 05:32.916
The trinity knot.

05:33.000 --> 05:36.375
Nothing is complete
without a third dimension.

05:36.458 --> 05:39.583
There isn't only up and down.

05:40.125 --> 05:41.708
There's a center, too.

05:42.958 --> 05:46.958
I think Einstein and Rosen
overlooked something.

05:51.208 --> 05:52.833
"Sic mundus

05:54.375 --> 05:56.208
creatus est."

05:56.708 --> 06:02.250
A wormhole connects not just two,
but three different dimensions.

06:02.916 --> 06:05.750
Future, present...

06:07.333 --> 06:08.583
and past.

07:11.250 --> 07:12.416
Helge...

07:20.708 --> 07:21.750
Good Lord.

07:22.458 --> 07:24.125
Just look at you.

07:27.166 --> 07:28.000
I...

07:30.000 --> 07:31.875
I was at the construction site.

07:31.958 --> 07:34.166
-There was something...
-Take off your clothes.

07:41.791 --> 07:44.583
I told you to take off your clothes.

08:24.375 --> 08:25.333
Go on.

08:38.958 --> 08:40.208
Wait here.

09:01.500 --> 09:05.125
Hello, my boy.
What have you been getting into again?

09:05.500 --> 09:08.083
-I was at the construction site.
-That's nice.

09:08.166 --> 09:09.708
They found something there.

09:09.791 --> 09:12.625
-What did they find?
-He's been creeping around again.

09:15.458 --> 09:17.208
Tell me, what did they find?

09:17.291 --> 09:19.666
There were police everywhere
at the construction site.

09:20.083 --> 09:21.625
-Police?
-Two dead bodies.

09:21.708 --> 09:24.916
-In the middle of the construction site.
-What are you talking about?

09:25.000 --> 09:26.458
They looked like kids.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.666
-What? Are you sure?
-Yes.

09:39.375 --> 09:40.666
You're not lying?

09:57.541 --> 09:58.500
You're late.

09:58.833 --> 10:01.250
The coins for Claudia are on the table.

10:08.583 --> 10:11.041
I've never seen this kind of burn before.

10:12.541 --> 10:14.375
Possibly from a phosphorous grenade.

10:15.125 --> 10:18.291
It's also interesting that both their ears
are completely destroyed.

10:20.833 --> 10:23.125
And that's not the only strange thing.

10:24.750 --> 10:26.541
They both had one around their neck.

10:31.916 --> 10:34.958
The coin is from 1986.

10:35.500 --> 10:36.666
Is this a joke?

10:36.750 --> 10:38.541
It gets even better. Take a look.

10:39.125 --> 10:40.416
The little tag on the collar.

10:49.750 --> 10:50.958
"Made in China"?

10:51.791 --> 10:53.375
All their clothes are from China.

10:55.333 --> 10:56.291
Chinese?

10:57.833 --> 11:00.500
They're definitely not from around here.
The boy here...

11:01.291 --> 11:04.458
He looks Mediterranean, or maybe Arabian.

11:04.541 --> 11:06.583
I don't know about the redhead.

11:07.541 --> 11:09.458
This tattoo is strange.

11:10.916 --> 11:14.583
I've seen all sorts of odd things,
but this...

11:15.416 --> 11:17.166
definitely takes the cake.

11:52.791 --> 11:54.833
One, two...

11:55.416 --> 11:56.458
three.

12:00.458 --> 12:05.375
One, two, three, four, five...

12:57.375 --> 13:00.166
You write
about Nietzsche's eternal recurrence...

13:00.833 --> 13:03.750
A universe that expands
and then collapses again.

13:06.583 --> 13:08.833
A universe that repeats itself endlessly.

13:11.458 --> 13:12.750
A JOURNEY THROUGH TIME
H.G. TANNHAUS

13:13.208 --> 13:15.541
It's been a long time
since I've seen that.

13:17.708 --> 13:21.208
There were only 500 copies in total.

13:22.041 --> 13:23.958
You write about the lunar-solar cycle,

13:24.041 --> 13:26.375
in which everything repeats itself
every 33 years.

13:26.458 --> 13:28.541
From a cosmic point of view, yes.

13:29.416 --> 13:35.250
Every 33 years, the cycle of the moon
is synchronized with that of the sun.

13:36.333 --> 13:37.833
But the 33...

13:38.458 --> 13:39.958
is more than that.

13:40.041 --> 13:41.541
We encounter it everywhere.

13:42.458 --> 13:45.333
Jesus performed 33 miracles.

13:45.416 --> 13:48.000
There are 33 litanies of the angels.

13:48.458 --> 13:51.875
Dante's 33 cantos in purgatory,

13:52.708 --> 13:54.666
and 33 in paradise.

13:55.291 --> 13:58.791
And it is the age
at which the Antichrist begins his rule.

14:15.333 --> 14:17.250
Why would someone do that?

14:18.333 --> 14:19.166
What?

14:20.666 --> 14:21.500
Kill.

14:23.708 --> 14:24.541
Why?

14:26.458 --> 14:28.541
What's inside them?
Where does it come from?

14:29.500 --> 14:31.708
-Why someone becomes a murderer?
-Yes.

14:31.791 --> 14:34.041
Are you born one or do you become one?

14:34.125 --> 14:37.708
It would certainly make our work easier
if we knew ahead of time.

14:37.791 --> 14:39.791
Lock them up while they're still little.

14:41.666 --> 14:43.666
Before they get on the wrong track.

14:45.750 --> 14:47.791
Why does someone become a murderer?

14:57.125 --> 14:58.458
Hey, weirdo!

15:00.333 --> 15:03.041
-Why the big hurry?
-Buying silk stockings for mommy?

15:04.125 --> 15:05.791
See if there's anything in his pockets.

15:09.000 --> 15:11.416
-Leave me alone!
-Scream. No one will hear you.

15:22.875 --> 15:26.250
Don't piss your pants. Your old man's
got dough coming out of his ears.

15:36.875 --> 15:39.125
-There's someone there.
-Let's get out of here!

15:55.958 --> 15:57.541
Hey, wait a minute.

16:03.875 --> 16:05.333
Did someone just come by here?

16:05.958 --> 16:07.791
An old man in pajamas?

16:09.833 --> 16:10.958
Are you okay?

16:13.000 --> 16:15.875
You have to defend yourself.
Or they'll never stop.

16:16.458 --> 16:18.208
But they're stronger than me.

16:20.791 --> 16:22.666
Then just bite them next time.

16:27.291 --> 16:32.000
Imagine you're standing
in an infinitely large, dark room,

16:32.625 --> 16:34.291
shining a light to the left.

16:37.666 --> 16:40.916
The beam should continue

16:41.500 --> 16:43.416
in the same direction forever.

16:43.833 --> 16:45.875
There's no reason to assume

16:45.958 --> 16:48.958
that it could come back at you
from the right.

16:49.041 --> 16:51.666
But a wormhole

16:51.750 --> 16:55.208
changes the topology

16:55.291 --> 16:57.458
of space-time.

16:58.458 --> 16:59.958
Bends it...

17:03.166 --> 17:05.625
Nothing is where it belongs anymore.

17:39.458 --> 17:42.041
Hello. Could you help me?

17:47.625 --> 17:49.375
Excuse me. We're not from around here.

17:49.833 --> 17:53.291
-I'm looking for Killinger Strasse 61.
-That's where I live.

17:53.875 --> 17:57.083
It's down the road and then to the right.

17:58.083 --> 18:00.708
-Are you Mr. Egon Tiedemann?
-No.

18:02.875 --> 18:04.291
How rude of me.

18:05.375 --> 18:06.833
My name is Agnes Nielsen.

18:08.708 --> 18:10.208
And this is my son Tronte.

18:10.583 --> 18:11.583
We're new in Winden.

18:17.375 --> 18:20.291
Tronte?
Come and say hello to the nice man.

18:29.875 --> 18:30.708
Hello.

18:35.208 --> 18:37.291
You're Tronte Nielsen?

18:39.541 --> 18:41.041
And you're Agnes Nielsen?

18:41.625 --> 18:42.458
Yes.

18:43.875 --> 18:48.625
Imagine traveling back in time
and meeting your father.

18:49.458 --> 18:51.416
Before he had you.

18:52.333 --> 18:55.541
Excuse the question.

18:55.625 --> 18:57.083
But what year is it?

18:59.416 --> 19:01.291
1953.

19:02.583 --> 19:05.708
Would you have already
changed things with this encounter?

19:07.791 --> 19:10.208
And is it even possible to change things?

19:10.291 --> 19:12.250
Are you all right?

19:12.333 --> 19:17.083
Or is time an eternal beast
that can't be defeated?

19:24.875 --> 19:26.125
What do you think?

19:26.708 --> 19:28.541
Can we change the course of events?

19:28.625 --> 19:31.000
Any scientist would tell you no.

19:31.541 --> 19:33.875
Causal determinism forbids it.

19:34.500 --> 19:39.333
But it is human nature to believe
that we play a role in our own lives.

19:39.416 --> 19:42.083
That our actions can change things.

19:43.708 --> 19:48.625
All my life, I've dreamed of traveling
through time, to see what was

19:49.291 --> 19:51.416
and what will be.

19:53.208 --> 19:54.708
You don't dream that anymore?

19:56.083 --> 19:57.916
Dreams change.

19:58.500 --> 20:00.083
Other things become important.

20:00.541 --> 20:04.083
My place is not
in the yesterday or tomorrow.

20:05.125 --> 20:06.875
Rather, it's right here.

20:07.791 --> 20:09.041
And now.

20:15.333 --> 20:16.500
Can I help you?

20:21.541 --> 20:23.083
Are you looking for a watch?

20:27.041 --> 20:28.333
Are you H.G. Tannhaus?

20:33.375 --> 20:35.208
This H.G. Tannhaus?

20:42.666 --> 20:45.250
No, not the same guy then, right?

20:50.958 --> 20:51.916
What year is it?

20:53.375 --> 20:54.333
What year?

20:55.333 --> 20:56.791
1953.

21:01.416 --> 21:02.833
1953.

21:07.458 --> 21:10.291
Stalin is dead. England has a Queen.

21:10.875 --> 21:12.750
And Nanga Parbat has been conquered.

21:13.458 --> 21:16.458
1953 as it lives and breathes, yes.

21:16.541 --> 21:20.416
It's not possible. Impossible.

21:21.291 --> 21:22.791
The number 33.

21:23.541 --> 21:26.500
You write that it could be
the time difference...

21:26.583 --> 21:29.541
between the planes
of a three dimensional wormhole.

21:29.958 --> 21:32.291
That's just a theory.

21:37.000 --> 21:39.166
But perhaps it could be
the crux of the matter.

21:42.291 --> 21:43.291
Here, girl.

21:45.125 --> 21:46.000
Here.

21:57.625 --> 22:01.125
You're late.
I've told you before to be on time.

22:01.208 --> 22:04.208
Claudia, I forgot the money at home.

22:04.291 --> 22:06.541
I'll bring it over later.

22:08.250 --> 22:09.291
Come in.

22:17.958 --> 22:20.125
FROM 1 TO 100

22:37.708 --> 22:38.583
Wrong.

22:40.041 --> 22:41.041
Wrong.

22:43.000 --> 22:44.083
Wrong.

22:46.666 --> 22:50.875
There are two rooms
and a small kitchen upstairs.

22:50.958 --> 22:53.500
Unfortunately,
the plumber hasn't been here yet.

22:53.583 --> 22:56.125
The water upstairs isn't working properly.

22:57.500 --> 22:59.541
This is my daughter Claudia.

22:59.625 --> 23:01.250
Claudia, please say hello.

23:01.333 --> 23:02.166
Hello.

23:03.125 --> 23:04.625
Agnes Nielsen.

23:06.333 --> 23:07.583
Tronte?

23:07.666 --> 23:09.583
-I'm Tronte.
-Claudia.

23:09.666 --> 23:12.666
This is our dog Gretchen.
I hope you're okay with dogs.

23:13.833 --> 23:15.708
My husband isn't here much.

23:15.791 --> 23:17.333
He's with the police.

23:17.416 --> 23:22.125
Sometimes it seems like he thinks
he alone is responsible for this town.

23:23.291 --> 23:24.708
And your husband is... ?

23:25.916 --> 23:28.791
-He's dead.
-Oh. I didn't mean to...

23:29.500 --> 23:31.291
I talk without thinking. It...

23:32.625 --> 23:34.458
I'm truly sorry.

23:39.250 --> 23:41.250
Do you want to see the rooms upstairs?

23:44.750 --> 23:47.250
Claudia, why don't you show
the boy the neighborhood later?

23:57.208 --> 23:58.041
Here you go.

24:02.041 --> 24:03.208
Should I call a doctor?

24:10.875 --> 24:13.791
-Hello.
-Hello, Ines. Hello, Jana.

24:13.875 --> 24:16.625
I'm here to pick up Dad's watch.
Is it ready?

24:19.333 --> 24:20.166
Right...

24:21.916 --> 24:24.416
Kahnwald, Kahnwald...

24:24.916 --> 24:25.958
Kahnwald.

24:26.458 --> 24:29.291
Here you go, Ines.
Purrs like a kitten again.

24:30.958 --> 24:33.791
Did you hear
what the police found this morning?

24:33.875 --> 24:37.000
No. But I'm sure you're about to tell me.

24:37.083 --> 24:39.166
Jana heard it in the teachers' room.

24:39.708 --> 24:41.416
The suspense is killing me.

24:41.500 --> 24:42.541
Mom?

24:43.750 --> 24:46.416
They found two dead bodies
on Doppler's construction site.

24:46.500 --> 24:49.250
Two little boys.
They were abducted by aliens.

24:49.333 --> 24:51.958
-For experiments.
-What did you just say?

24:54.041 --> 24:55.916
About the aliens?

24:56.000 --> 24:57.416
No, about the boys.

24:57.500 --> 25:00.500
The police found
two dead boys this morning.

25:25.083 --> 25:27.125
The discovery of uranium fission

25:27.208 --> 25:30.166
has heralded in a new era
in the history of humankind.

25:31.125 --> 25:34.333
An era of reason,

25:34.416 --> 25:35.791
objectivity,

25:35.875 --> 25:38.083
and the dominance of man over nature.

25:38.166 --> 25:40.125
ENERGY OF THE FUTURE

25:43.166 --> 25:46.958
We can harness this phenomenon

25:47.041 --> 25:49.791
by economically utilizing
neutron-induced fission

25:49.875 --> 25:53.083
in nuclear reactors.

25:53.750 --> 25:55.375
A minuscule atom...

25:56.458 --> 25:58.000
can change the world.

25:59.208 --> 26:03.708
And it is here that we will build
the first German nuclear power plant,

26:03.791 --> 26:06.625
ensuring the local community's

26:07.083 --> 26:09.708
long-term stability and prosperity.

26:13.125 --> 26:14.916
STOP! POLICE
KEEP OUT! CRIME SCENE

26:15.000 --> 26:18.208
I need a list of all the workers
that have been on the premises.

26:18.750 --> 26:20.583
What's the point?

26:20.666 --> 26:24.458
You should be asking who might have a
problem with the power plant being built.

26:24.791 --> 26:25.791
The power plant?

26:25.875 --> 26:29.000
I just spoke to the city council
about the building permit.

26:29.083 --> 26:30.500
And just like that,

26:30.750 --> 26:35.041
two dead children's corpses appear
on the construction site one day earlier?

26:37.416 --> 26:39.708
And who put them there, in your opinion?

26:44.000 --> 26:45.250
The coal plant operators.

26:47.750 --> 26:49.208
You don't believe me.

26:50.000 --> 26:54.416
If this power plant gets built,
it will be nothing short of a revolution.

26:55.708 --> 26:57.875
Not only will it change Winden.

26:57.958 --> 26:59.833
Nuclear energy

26:59.916 --> 27:03.916
will bring growth and wealth
to the entire nation.

27:04.000 --> 27:05.583
But it means change.

27:05.666 --> 27:07.666
The old must give way to the new.

27:07.750 --> 27:09.625
Not everyone likes that.

27:11.750 --> 27:15.083
I'll send you a list with the names
of the coal plant operators.

27:16.333 --> 27:17.416
You'll see.

27:17.500 --> 27:19.625
The whole thing is a conspiracy.

27:54.125 --> 27:57.000
These are our caves.
We're not allowed to go in very far.

27:57.083 --> 27:59.750
But sometimes we do it anyway.
As a dare, you know?

28:01.041 --> 28:01.958
A dare?

28:05.041 --> 28:05.875
Sure.

28:07.416 --> 28:09.916
Shouldn't you be heading home by now?

28:10.416 --> 28:11.791
And you still owe me a mark.

28:13.791 --> 28:15.583
Come on. Let's keep going.

28:16.458 --> 28:18.166
We're rid of him.

28:29.875 --> 28:31.500
Come on. Come.

28:46.875 --> 28:50.583
Gretchen! Come, Gretchen, come!

28:55.625 --> 28:58.666
-Is one of the two my son?
-I can't help you.

28:58.750 --> 29:00.375
I just want to know
if one of them is mine.

29:00.458 --> 29:02.208
-Calm down!
-Let go. Right now!

29:02.291 --> 29:03.666
What's going on here?

29:05.125 --> 29:07.833
The two boys you found this morning,
what did they look like?

29:07.916 --> 29:11.041
What did they look like?
Did one have brown hair? 11 years old?

29:11.125 --> 29:13.291
-Why do you want to know?
-My son...

29:13.375 --> 29:17.583
My son disappeared. All I want to know
is if one of the dead kids is mine.

29:18.791 --> 29:22.083
His name is Mikkel.
He's 11 years old. Brown hair. Blue eyes.

29:22.166 --> 29:24.541
About this tall. I have a picture.

29:24.625 --> 29:26.416
-Shit, my jacket!
-He's drunk.

29:28.916 --> 29:29.750
No.

29:30.208 --> 29:34.708
One's pretty dark, brown eyes. Foreign.
The other a bit taller, bright red hair.

29:35.125 --> 29:36.500
You're sure there wasn't a third?

29:37.625 --> 29:39.791
Have you reported your son missing?

29:40.125 --> 29:42.250
Do you know someone
by the name of Helge Doppler?

29:42.333 --> 29:45.000
-Bernd Doppler's son?
-No. Old, about 70.

29:46.041 --> 29:48.041
The only old one is Bernd Doppler.

29:50.666 --> 29:52.375
Bernd Doppler
from the nuclear power plant?

29:54.416 --> 29:56.875
-Bernd is Helge's dad.
-Correct.

29:59.666 --> 30:01.208
Stop. Wait!

30:07.041 --> 30:08.250
But you...

30:09.833 --> 30:12.333
Why are you so fascinated with time?

30:12.416 --> 30:14.500
I want to understand if I can change it.

30:14.583 --> 30:16.625
If everything has a purpose, and if so...

30:17.416 --> 30:19.375
who decides about this purpose?

30:21.291 --> 30:22.625
Coincidence?

30:24.291 --> 30:25.250
God?

30:26.000 --> 30:27.208
Or is it us?

30:27.291 --> 30:29.250
Are we actually free in our actions?

30:30.583 --> 30:34.083
Or is it all created anew,
in an eternally recurring cycle?

30:35.791 --> 30:37.500
And we can only obey the laws of nature

30:37.583 --> 30:39.625
and are nothing but slaves
of space and time.

30:53.416 --> 30:55.583
-Egon.
-What?

30:55.666 --> 30:57.375
-They're here.
-Who?

30:57.458 --> 30:59.625
The woman who called about the rooms.

30:59.708 --> 31:01.458
She's odd, but I think she's nice.

31:02.000 --> 31:03.833
I think she'll take the rooms.

31:18.625 --> 31:20.375
Did something bad happen?

31:22.541 --> 31:24.541
No. It's just...

31:28.291 --> 31:30.125
Everything's fine.

31:31.875 --> 31:33.208
Mrs. Nielsen?

31:36.250 --> 31:39.083
Mrs. Nielsen,
this is Egon Tiedemann, my husband.

31:40.333 --> 31:41.166
Hello.

31:42.000 --> 31:42.833
Hello.

31:48.125 --> 31:50.458
Your wife has told me a lot about you.

31:50.916 --> 31:53.125
-You have a very nice home.
-Thank you.

31:53.750 --> 31:56.083
Did you arrive today?

31:58.291 --> 32:01.875
May I ask
why you came to Winden, of all places?

32:01.958 --> 32:04.333
Stop questioning her.

32:04.416 --> 32:06.958
My husband is a policeman.
He can't help being curious.

32:10.000 --> 32:11.583
My grandmother is from Winden.

32:12.000 --> 32:13.958
She always gushed about this town.

32:15.000 --> 32:16.833
May I ask
what your grandmother's name was?

32:18.583 --> 32:19.708
Dad! Dad! Dad!

32:20.500 --> 32:22.416
Gretchen is gone! In the woods.

32:22.958 --> 32:26.208
-She was there and then she was gone.
-Calm down and tell me what happened.

32:26.666 --> 32:29.375
I was showing Tronte the woods.
The path down into town.

32:29.458 --> 32:32.041
Gretchen was with us the whole time,
then she disappeared.

32:32.125 --> 32:33.000
And where's Helge?

32:34.833 --> 32:36.500
-Maybe Gretchen is with Helge.
-Yes.

32:37.125 --> 32:40.458
-That must be it.
-Can you go and find out?

32:43.750 --> 32:46.708
-I was going to see the Dopplers anyway.
-Egon...

32:47.541 --> 32:50.916
I invited Agnes and Tronte to dinner.
Don't be late again, okay?

32:54.833 --> 32:59.916
Time loops have a significant impact
on the principle of causality.

33:02.416 --> 33:05.166
On the relationship of cause and effect.

33:06.916 --> 33:11.208
As long as a wormhole exists,
there is a closed time loop.

33:11.291 --> 33:13.833
Inside it,
everything is mutually dependent.

33:14.250 --> 33:18.000
The past
doesn't just influence the future.

33:21.583 --> 33:24.625
The future also influences the past.

33:25.125 --> 33:28.458
It's like the question
of the chicken and the egg.

33:32.291 --> 33:35.833
We can no longer say
which of the two came first.

33:38.833 --> 33:41.958
Everything is interconnected.

33:58.416 --> 33:59.250
Hey.

34:09.375 --> 34:11.291
You're Helge Doppler, aren't you?

34:12.000 --> 34:13.416
Yes. Why?

34:18.333 --> 34:19.750
Look at this.

34:23.041 --> 34:24.875
Have you ever seen that before?

34:29.291 --> 34:30.125
No.

34:36.750 --> 34:38.666
Did you find the man you're looking for?

34:40.500 --> 34:41.333
Yes.

34:45.583 --> 34:47.208
You look sad.

34:49.541 --> 34:51.208
What's in your box?

35:02.750 --> 35:04.000
Did you kill them?

35:08.208 --> 35:11.000
Hey. I asked if you killed them.

35:13.583 --> 35:16.625
They just fall from the sky.
They just plop down.

35:17.458 --> 35:18.666
I just collect them.

35:20.833 --> 35:22.833
They're so beautiful when they're dead.

35:33.500 --> 35:35.625
But you will kill something.

35:38.166 --> 35:39.416
The two boys at the construction site.

35:43.875 --> 35:44.875
My brother.

35:50.666 --> 35:51.500
My son.

35:52.958 --> 35:54.541
Not now, but in the future.

35:58.666 --> 36:01.208
But I can change it, you know.

36:01.875 --> 36:03.458
I can change the past.

36:03.958 --> 36:05.291
And the future.

36:06.458 --> 36:07.916
Help!

36:08.375 --> 36:10.208
If you don't exist,
all of this won't happen.

36:13.208 --> 36:14.541
No!

37:46.250 --> 37:49.333
-Mrs. Doppler will be right down.
-Thank you.

38:06.000 --> 38:07.291
Hello, Mrs. Doppler.

38:07.375 --> 38:08.833
My husband isn't home.

38:09.291 --> 38:10.125
I...

38:10.666 --> 38:13.250
I'm looking for Gretchen.

38:14.708 --> 38:15.916
Our dog.

38:16.458 --> 38:18.958
-Perhaps Helge took her home?
-Certainly not.

38:19.041 --> 38:21.333
Helge knows
we don't allow animals in the house.

38:24.250 --> 38:25.791
Then I have no idea where she is.

38:27.208 --> 38:28.083
There is no dog here.

38:30.125 --> 38:31.375
Anything else?

38:32.083 --> 38:33.875
No. Thank you.

38:34.875 --> 38:36.791
Sorry about the disturbance.

38:39.000 --> 38:40.875
In case the dog turns up...

38:43.541 --> 38:44.416
Good day.

38:52.166 --> 38:53.333
Helge?

38:56.000 --> 38:56.875
Helge!

41:36.958 --> 41:40.583
All our lives are connected.

41:41.666 --> 41:45.000
One fate bound to another.

41:46.666 --> 41:49.041
Every one of our deeds is merely

41:49.125 --> 41:52.250
a response to a previous deed.

41:52.708 --> 41:54.625
Cause and effect.

41:55.375 --> 41:57.875
Nothing but an endless dance.

42:00.125 --> 42:02.750
MISSING
MIKKEL NIELSEN

42:10.083 --> 42:13.833
Everything is connected
to everything else.

42:26.708 --> 42:29.041
But that's just a theory.

42:33.291 --> 42:38.416
I can't shake the feeling that you're
actually here about something else.

42:39.083 --> 42:42.458
What if I told you
that everything in your book was true?

42:42.958 --> 42:44.666
That time travel is possible.

42:44.750 --> 42:46.625
Your theory on the formation of wormholes

42:46.708 --> 42:49.083
through gravitational impulses
is not just theory.

42:50.333 --> 42:52.208
There is such a hole. Here in Winden.

42:56.625 --> 42:58.250
I come from the future.

43:08.583 --> 43:11.583
I traveled through the wormhole to 1986.

43:28.541 --> 43:31.083
Where... where did you get that?

43:31.166 --> 43:32.208
It's broken.

43:32.833 --> 43:34.083
You have to fix it.

43:34.666 --> 43:36.083
I can't do that.

43:37.458 --> 43:39.875
Aren't those your initials? You built it.

43:40.541 --> 43:44.083
This device enables one to travel
through time and space?

43:45.083 --> 43:46.750
It can create a wormhole?

43:46.833 --> 43:49.583
It opens a portal through which
one can travel

43:49.666 --> 43:52.250
33 years into the past
and 33 years into the future.

43:53.750 --> 43:56.375
And the wormhole you traveled through?

43:57.916 --> 43:59.500
Did that device create it?

44:00.416 --> 44:01.250
No.

44:02.708 --> 44:05.291
A few months ago,
an incident at the nuclear power plant

44:05.375 --> 44:07.166
released a blast of energy.

44:08.666 --> 44:12.291
But the device is able
to repeat that same process.

44:12.375 --> 44:15.375
And you want to create another wormhole?

44:16.750 --> 44:18.916
No, I want to destroy the one that exists.

44:22.875 --> 44:24.708
I want you to leave now.

44:27.458 --> 44:29.291
This town is like a festering wound.

44:29.958 --> 44:32.250
And we're all a part of it.
But I can change it.

44:32.333 --> 44:34.375
-Your device can change it.
-Leave.

44:35.125 --> 44:36.541
Leave now.

44:52.041 --> 44:53.416
I've seen the future.

44:54.083 --> 44:55.458
I know what will happen.

44:58.041 --> 45:01.375
I have to set things right again.
And you have to help me.

49:56.666 --> 50:00.666
