How's the garage sale
going, Quagmire?
Pretty good.

00:37.204 --> 00:39.070
Just clearing some of my stuff
out of the basement.

00:39.072 --> 00:42.040
It's amazing what you find
when you clean your basement.

00:42.042 --> 00:44.809
Peter, you almost done
down there?

00:44.811 --> 00:46.244
(laughing)

00:46.246 --> 00:47.479
Look what I found.

00:47.481 --> 00:48.546
That's wonderful, Peter.

00:48.548 --> 00:52.717
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna go do some skywriting.

00:58.357 --> 01:01.226
(cackling)

01:01.327 --> 01:03.995
Hey, look at all these videos
Mr. Quagmire's selling.

01:03.997 --> 01:07.165
Wow, <i>The Best of the World's</i>
<i>W</i> <i>ildest Police Chases.</i>

01:07.167 --> 01:11.770
(gasps)
And it even has the one
with the Flintstones!

01:11.772 --> 01:12.871
(horns honking)

01:12.873 --> 01:15.006
ANNOUNCER:
<i>Amazingly, this drunk driver</i>

01:15.008 --> 01:17.042
<i>turns left</i>
<i>into oncoming traffic!</i>

01:17.044 --> 01:19.310
<i>He narrowly misses</i>
<i>hitting a pedestrian</i>

01:19.312 --> 01:22.113
<i>who jumps out of the way</i>
<i>just in time.</i>

01:22.115 --> 01:23.081
<i>Now the driver can add</i>

01:23.083 --> 01:25.150
<i>attempted battery</i>
<i>to the charges.</i>

01:25.152 --> 01:27.452
<i>The driver turns right</i>
<i>into the parking lot</i>

01:27.454 --> 01:29.320
<i>of a drive-in movie theater.</i>

01:29.322 --> 01:33.291
<i>At this point,</i>
<i>the dinosaur in the backseat</i>

01:33.293 --> 01:34.492
<i>pokes his head up</i>
<i>through the roof</i>

01:34.494 --> 01:37.562
<i>and the driver places two</i>
<i>small children on top of it.</i>

01:37.564 --> 01:41.332
<i>Now he's not only</i>
<i>endangering his own life,</i>

01:41.334 --> 01:43.935
<i>but their lives as well.</i>

01:43.937 --> 01:47.038
<i>The driver totals the car</i>
<i>and makes a run for it,</i>

01:47.040 --> 01:50.542
<i>but the pursuing officers</i>
<i>are prepared.</i>

01:50.544 --> 01:52.243
<i>Running from the cops?</i>

01:52.245 --> 01:54.612
<i>Yabba-dabba-don't!</i>

01:54.780 --> 01:58.116
Hey, Quagmire, I think I might
wanna buy this ham radio off ya.

01:58.118 --> 01:59.984
Sure, Peter,
that'll be $50.

01:59.986 --> 02:01.119
50 bucks?

02:01.121 --> 02:02.220
All right, fine,
I'll buy it.

02:02.222 --> 02:05.757
Man, this is a bigger rip-off
than Shrunky Dinks.

02:06.592 --> 02:07.992
They already been shrunk.

02:07.994 --> 02:10.161
Happy "birthmas."

02:13.132 --> 02:15.300
(static crackling)

02:15.302 --> 02:18.870
Peter, you been fiddling with
that ham radio for seven weeks.

02:18.872 --> 02:19.370
Take a shower!

02:19.372 --> 02:22.107
I can barely get any reception
on this stupid thing.

02:22.109 --> 02:24.943
So far the only station that
comes in is some British guys

02:24.945 --> 02:27.178
reading news from places
I'm not sure exist.

02:27.180 --> 02:30.181
Today, in Kuzikistan,
a peaceful demonstration

02:30.183 --> 02:33.118
turned to bloodshed as members
of the Turzirly tribe

02:33.120 --> 02:35.086
flooded Kenpao Square
in remembrance

02:35.088 --> 02:37.922
of the third anniversary
of the Hormsburg Massacre.

02:37.924 --> 02:41.126
But finally, some good news
out of neighboring Kanduzi,

02:41.128 --> 02:43.461
as locals there have reached
an uneasy alliance

02:43.463 --> 02:45.730
with the bordering
Trolika Bubsie Wubsie Dal.

02:45.732 --> 02:49.000
And now with sports,
here's Framptal Tromwibbler.

02:49.002 --> 02:51.836
From the world of sport,
the Cointen Spinky Whompers

02:51.838 --> 02:54.405
flumped the Floing Boing
Welfencloppers,

02:54.407 --> 02:56.241
70-fluff to 40-flabe.

02:56.243 --> 02:59.010
At the tone, the time
will be 26 railroad.

02:59.012 --> 03:00.145
(tone beeps)

03:00.147 --> 03:01.379
I'm not sure about any of that.

03:01.381 --> 03:04.048
You know, Dad, I saw
that movie <i>White Noise,</i>

03:04.050 --> 03:06.584
and they said you can
use empty radio static

03:06.586 --> 03:08.219
to talk to dead people.

03:08.221 --> 03:09.954
You idiot,
ghosts don't exist.

03:09.956 --> 03:12.323
Wait a second. They might.

03:12.325 --> 03:14.626
(static crackling)

03:14.628 --> 03:16.628
Hello, ghosts.

03:16.630 --> 03:18.029
Come in, ghosts.

03:18.031 --> 03:19.230
MAN:
Hello?

03:19.232 --> 03:20.532
Hello? Who's this?

03:20.534 --> 03:22.367
This is Ronald Reagan.

03:22.369 --> 03:23.201
Ronald Reagan?

03:23.203 --> 03:24.969
The guy that used to bang
that 70-pound witch?

03:24.971 --> 03:28.907
Ronald Reagan, former
President of the United States.

03:28.909 --> 03:30.508
Oh, my God!

03:30.510 --> 03:31.676
(dialing)

03:31.678 --> 03:36.014
Hey, Quagmire, guess who
I'm talking to right now?

03:36.016 --> 03:37.382
Yep!

03:40.052 --> 03:41.619
Brian, will you take me
down to Baby Gap?

03:41.621 --> 03:44.322
I want to dress
like a small douche.

03:44.324 --> 03:45.590
No, maybe tomorrow or Tuesday.

03:45.592 --> 03:47.292
But you said you'd do it today.

03:47.294 --> 03:48.393
Eh, I'm kinda tired.

03:48.395 --> 03:49.527
Oh, for God's sake.

03:49.529 --> 03:51.129
Cancel my Tuesday appointments!

03:51.131 --> 03:52.197
Sure thing, Stewie.

03:52.199 --> 03:54.332
You want me to move it
to another day?

03:54.334 --> 03:55.533
No, no, just cancel it.

03:55.535 --> 03:57.502
Okay, will do.

03:57.504 --> 03:58.636
Who the hell was that?
Hmm?

03:58.638 --> 04:00.138
There was another
Stewie right there.

04:00.140 --> 04:02.674
Oh, yeah, well, you know,
I've been so damn busy lately,

04:02.676 --> 04:04.075
my schedule's been so packed,

04:04.077 --> 04:06.110
I felt like I needed
some kind of an errand boy

04:06.112 --> 04:08.546
to do all my nitpicky,
pain-in-the-ass stuff.

04:08.548 --> 04:09.581
So I cloned myself.

04:09.583 --> 04:11.482
You... you cloned yourself?

04:11.484 --> 04:12.283
What are you? Deaf?

04:12.285 --> 04:15.687
So he's an exact
copy of you?
Well, not exact.

04:15.689 --> 04:16.988
I have to remain superior

04:16.990 --> 04:18.456
so I bred out some
of the intelligence.

04:18.458 --> 04:20.525
Made him sort of
a simpleton, you know.

04:20.527 --> 04:22.794
I call him Bitch Stewie.

04:23.295 --> 04:24.996
Would you like to meet him?

04:25.331 --> 04:27.532
Would you like
to meet Bitch Stewie?

04:27.534 --> 04:29.000
Uh, yeah, I guess.

04:29.002 --> 04:30.134
Bitch Stewie!

04:30.136 --> 04:32.003
Come here and meet
my friend, Brian.

04:32.005 --> 04:32.637
Hey, there, Stewie.

04:32.639 --> 04:34.205
Oh, what's that?
You got a friend?

04:34.207 --> 04:37.141
Oh, I'm always happy to meet
one of your friends.

04:37.143 --> 04:37.709
Dear God.

04:37.711 --> 04:40.478
How do you do?
Pleased to meet you.
I'm Bitch Stewie.

04:40.480 --> 04:41.312
He's got quite a grip.

04:41.314 --> 04:44.315
Hey, Bitch Stewie, why are
there no midget accountants?

04:44.317 --> 04:47.218
Because they always
come up short.

04:47.220 --> 04:48.519
(laughing)

04:48.521 --> 04:50.121
Oh, another good one, Stewie!

04:50.123 --> 04:51.990
I don't know where
you come up with them.

04:51.992 --> 04:53.157
Isn't he wonderful?

04:53.159 --> 04:56.194
And all I have to feed him
is a crude peanut paste.

04:56.196 --> 04:57.595
Watch this.

04:58.197 --> 04:59.564
Uh-huh!

04:59.566 --> 05:01.332
It's not much,
but it's healthier

05:01.334 --> 05:03.001
than what people
ate in the '50s.

05:03.003 --> 05:04.402
Steak and doughnut
sandwich, please.

05:04.404 --> 05:05.904
You want cigarettes
on that sandwich?

05:05.906 --> 05:07.438
What do I look like?
A Mary?

05:07.440 --> 05:09.107
Yes, I want cigarettes!

05:12.011 --> 05:13.211
Okay, next up on the stage,

05:13.213 --> 05:17.148
let's have a big karaoke welcome
for Peter and Ron!

05:17.150 --> 05:18.349
(light applause)

05:18.351 --> 05:20.551
Okay, this is one
of our favorites.

05:20.553 --> 05:23.087
Hope it's one of yours.

Oh, hello, Brian.

06:08.668 --> 06:10.668
Oh, there's your
friend, Brian!

06:10.670 --> 06:11.436
Hey, Brian!

06:11.438 --> 06:14.038
I sure did enjoy talking
to you the other day!

06:14.040 --> 06:16.407
I'm just making sure
Stewie is nice and clean

06:16.409 --> 06:18.543
for his trip to the playground
this afternoon.

06:18.545 --> 06:20.178
We had a little bit
of a problem earlier

06:20.180 --> 06:23.548
because Bitch Stewie was
stooling in the tub, wasn't he?

06:23.550 --> 06:24.315
I did some poos.

06:24.317 --> 06:25.483
I did some poos
I didn't mean to.

06:25.485 --> 06:28.453
But we've rectified that now,
and everything's fine.

06:28.455 --> 06:29.320
This is really weird.

06:29.322 --> 06:31.189
I mean, it's one thing
to have him help you out

06:31.191 --> 06:32.190
with a busy schedule.

06:32.192 --> 06:33.725
It's another thing
to let him wash your back.

06:33.727 --> 06:35.593
Well, he does more
than that, Brian.

06:35.595 --> 06:38.329
Bitch Stewie, give
me a bubble beard.

06:39.098 --> 06:41.599
Look at me, I'm
George Bernard Shaw.

06:41.601 --> 06:44.102
(laughing):
That's awful funny, Stewie!

06:44.104 --> 06:46.504
I don't know who
George Bernard Shaw is,

06:46.506 --> 06:49.140
but you look like
an old Stewie, Stewie.

06:49.142 --> 06:51.476
Enjoy your weird bath.

06:51.478 --> 06:52.844
I told him I did the poos

06:52.846 --> 06:55.113
even though you did
the poos, Stewie.

06:55.115 --> 06:56.347
Did I do good, Stewie?

06:56.349 --> 06:58.516
That was very correct
of you, Bitch Stewie.

06:58.518 --> 07:00.685
You're a good helper.

07:04.156 --> 07:05.790
REAGAN:
And what a lot
of people don't know

07:05.792 --> 07:08.426
is that I was
Jane Wyman's first.

07:08.428 --> 07:11.229
You might say
I broke her Jane Wyman.

07:11.231 --> 07:13.131
(all laughing)

07:13.133 --> 07:14.065
Oh, Reagan is a delight!

07:14.067 --> 07:15.266
He sure is, and you
know what else?

07:15.268 --> 07:19.337
The ghost of Reagan
is gonna be the new
fourth guy in our group.

07:19.339 --> 07:20.405
I'm all for that.

07:20.407 --> 07:21.906
What other stories
you got, Reagan?

07:21.908 --> 07:22.840
Well, I remember the time

07:22.842 --> 07:25.743
I invited Ed Sullivan
to the White House.

07:25.745 --> 07:27.412
He sounded a little
something like this:

07:27.414 --> 07:30.782
(imitating Ed Sullivan):
Hey, Ron, tonight we got
a really big show.

07:30.784 --> 07:33.251
Ah, Reagan
does impressions!

07:33.253 --> 07:33.951
That's right.

07:33.953 --> 07:36.220
And you know who else
does impressions?

07:36.222 --> 07:36.654
Rich Little.

07:36.656 --> 07:39.891
In fact, you ought to go see his
show at the Mohegan Sun Casino

07:39.893 --> 07:42.827
next Saturday
at 3:00 PM and 5:00 PM.

07:42.829 --> 07:44.295
Wait a second.

07:44.297 --> 07:45.830
Yeah, no (bleep).
What?

07:45.832 --> 07:47.398
Peter, that's not Ronald Reagan.

07:47.400 --> 07:48.633
That's Rich Little!

07:48.635 --> 07:49.734
You're Rich Little!

07:49.736 --> 07:51.369
He must be on his
own ham radio!

07:51.371 --> 07:53.171
(imitating Johnny Carson):
Ah, well, uh, you know, Ed,

07:53.173 --> 07:56.774
the kids say you gotta go viral
to promote yourself these days.

07:56.776 --> 07:58.276
So, this is not Reagan?

07:58.278 --> 07:59.343
No, it's Rich Little.

07:59.345 --> 08:00.411
He's an impressionist.

08:00.413 --> 08:01.679
He's been screwing
with your head.

08:01.681 --> 08:03.114
Well, this thing
is worthless!

08:03.116 --> 08:05.783
Like my Palestinian
alarm clock.

08:07.486 --> 08:09.120
Allahu Akbar!

08:16.195 --> 08:17.261
Hey, Peter, what's up?

08:17.263 --> 08:17.995
Hey, Quagmire, uh, listen,

08:17.997 --> 08:20.431
I'm here to get my money
back for that ham radio.

08:20.433 --> 08:22.400
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
slow down there, partner.

08:22.402 --> 08:23.367
All sales are final.

08:23.369 --> 08:26.337
Yeah, but you were Agamemnon
with me during the sale.

08:26.339 --> 08:26.604
What?

08:26.606 --> 08:28.573
I just saw that word somewhere.
I wanted to use it.

08:28.575 --> 08:31.542
Look, Peter, why don't you just
go home before you get hurt?

08:31.544 --> 08:32.710
Well, I'm clearly
not the only one

08:32.712 --> 08:34.245
who was dissatisfied
with his purchase.

08:34.247 --> 08:36.981
Whoever bought that baby from
you obviously didn't want it.

08:36.983 --> 08:40.184
A baby? I didn't sell a baby.

08:42.154 --> 08:44.255
Look, there's a note.

08:44.456 --> 08:46.324
"Glenn, this is your child.

08:46.326 --> 08:48.826
Next time wear
a condom, jerk."

08:48.828 --> 08:49.894
Oh, my God!

08:49.896 --> 08:51.529
Well, now,
hang on, Quagmire.

08:51.531 --> 08:53.798
There's no guarantee
it's your baby.

08:53.800 --> 08:54.866
Giggity?

08:54.868 --> 08:58.202
Oh...
I say that.

09:05.177 --> 09:06.911
Well, the DNA test
results are back.

09:06.913 --> 09:09.780
This little girl is definitely
your baby, Quagmire.

09:09.782 --> 09:11.382
Wh-What am I
supposed to do?

09:11.384 --> 09:12.450
I-I don't want a baby.

09:12.452 --> 09:14.719
Look, somebody's gotta take
this kid off my hands.

09:14.721 --> 09:15.753
I-I can't be a father.

09:15.755 --> 09:17.822
Well, Glenn, you don't
have a choice.

09:17.824 --> 09:19.624
This baby is
your responsibility.

09:19.626 --> 09:22.393
Now, I brought you a basket
of things to get you started.

09:22.395 --> 09:24.729
There's baby clothes,
some toys, and some books.

09:24.731 --> 09:28.599
Now, if you have any questions,
we're right across the street.

09:33.472 --> 09:36.741
Hey, what's going on?

09:36.743 --> 09:37.408
(coos)

09:37.410 --> 09:40.645
Not really sure what I'm
supposed to do with you.

09:40.647 --> 09:43.814
There's some frozen steaks
in the freezer.

09:43.816 --> 09:46.083
Bathroom's down the hall
to the right.

09:46.085 --> 09:49.053
Uh, if you ever come home
and there's a tie on the door,

09:49.055 --> 09:50.688
it means I'm froggin' someone,

09:50.690 --> 09:53.991
so give me at least,
uh, a couple hours.

09:53.993 --> 09:56.627
You smoke?

10:00.532 --> 10:01.599
Stewie, what are
you doing here?

10:01.601 --> 10:04.535
I thought you were going to
Bobby Stalling's birthday party.

10:04.537 --> 10:05.503
Ugh, I hate that kid.

10:05.505 --> 10:07.738
And I hate children's
birthday parties.

10:07.740 --> 10:09.974
I sent Bitch Stewie
in my place.

10:12.344 --> 10:14.478
Oh, what a great
little party, Janet.

10:14.480 --> 10:18.282
You know, I've never seen Stewie
come out of his shell so much.

10:19.051 --> 10:21.519
Oh, no, it's not on his tail.

10:21.521 --> 10:23.788
It's on his face.
I've ruined it!

10:23.790 --> 10:25.756
Oh, no, well,
that's okay, though.

10:25.758 --> 10:27.625
Somebody else will come along
and get it right!

10:27.627 --> 10:29.994
Thanks for coming to my
birthday party, Stewie.

10:29.996 --> 10:32.129
Oh, I wouldn't have
missed it for anything!

10:32.131 --> 10:34.232
I've never been
to a party before!

10:34.234 --> 10:36.033
Wanna watch me
blow out the candles?

10:36.035 --> 10:37.602
I would love to see that!

10:37.604 --> 10:39.904
And gosh, Bobby,
I'd love to play

10:39.906 --> 10:41.072
with some of your
birthday toys,

10:41.074 --> 10:42.740
but only after you've
played with them

10:42.742 --> 10:44.875
and only if you
say it's okay!

10:44.877 --> 10:45.776
You know, Stewie,
I gotta say,

10:45.778 --> 10:47.745
that clone of yours
has come in pretty handy.

10:47.747 --> 10:49.880
I, uh, don't suppose
you'd consider

10:49.882 --> 10:51.983
making one of those
for me, would you?

10:51.985 --> 10:53.584
(chuckles)
Maybe.

10:53.586 --> 10:55.820
What would you be
willing to do for me?

10:55.822 --> 10:56.854
What do you want?

10:56.856 --> 10:59.490
Take your index finger
and your thumb

10:59.492 --> 11:02.059
and lightly grip
the base of your tail.

11:02.061 --> 11:03.494
What?

11:03.496 --> 11:05.496
Lightly grip
the base of your tail

11:05.498 --> 11:07.298
with your index finger
and your thumb

11:07.300 --> 11:11.269
and then slide your fingers
up the length of your tail

11:11.271 --> 11:12.536
to the tip.

11:12.538 --> 11:12.837
Why?

11:12.839 --> 11:15.006
Because that's
what I asked you to do.

11:15.008 --> 11:15.973
That's kind of weird.

11:15.975 --> 11:17.475
Is this some kind
of sexual thing?

11:17.477 --> 11:18.976
Nobody said anything
about "sexual."

11:18.978 --> 11:20.444
There's nothing
sexual about it.

11:20.446 --> 11:22.847
I'm just asking you
to perform a simple task.

11:22.849 --> 11:25.650
Take your index finger
and your thumb

11:25.652 --> 11:28.085
and lightly grip
the base of your tail

11:28.087 --> 11:31.956
and run your fingers
along the length of your tail.

11:31.958 --> 11:32.657
You mean, stroke it?

11:32.659 --> 11:34.992
Nobody used that word.
This is not a stroking motion.

11:34.994 --> 11:38.696
This is a completely nonsexual
thing I am asking you to do

11:38.698 --> 11:40.898
in a completely
nonsexual way.

11:40.900 --> 11:43.634
Squeeze the base
of the tail lightly

11:43.636 --> 11:45.636
with your thumb
and index finger

11:45.638 --> 11:48.439
and then,
while continuing to squeeze,

11:48.441 --> 11:51.909
run them up the length
of your tail to the tip.

11:51.911 --> 11:54.045
And I'll make you a clone.

11:54.047 --> 11:55.713
I only have to do it once?

11:55.715 --> 11:58.482
I'll tell you when to stop.

12:00.686 --> 12:02.887
(laughing):
I don't know
why you're stopping.

12:02.889 --> 12:05.523
Nobody told you to stop.

12:07.125 --> 12:09.660
Give me a little smile.

12:09.662 --> 12:10.695
Your lips look
a little dry.

12:10.697 --> 12:13.664
Why don't you wet 'em
a little bit?

12:14.933 --> 12:15.700
(laughing)

12:15.702 --> 12:18.202
Oh, my God,
you're so weird!

12:18.204 --> 12:21.305
All right, I'll make you
a clone, buddy.

12:23.575 --> 12:26.410
Oh, she's a beautiful
little girl, Glenn.

12:26.412 --> 12:28.012
Have you given her
a name yet?

12:28.014 --> 12:29.013
Yeah, I named her
Anna Lee,

12:29.015 --> 12:31.115
but I'm probably just going
to call her "Annal" for short.

12:31.117 --> 12:32.116
That's funny.
Thank you.

12:32.118 --> 12:33.884
Anyway,
thanks for all the baby stuff.

12:33.886 --> 12:35.453
Hey, what's
that big tarp over there?

12:35.455 --> 12:38.422
Oh, that was Chris's blankie
from when he was a baby.

12:38.424 --> 12:39.090
Yeah, he was a big kid.

12:39.092 --> 12:41.759
Almost split Lois in half,
coming out of her.

12:41.761 --> 12:42.493
It's true.

12:42.495 --> 12:44.562
I never mentioned this because
I don't want him to feel bad,

12:44.564 --> 12:47.898
but after he was born, they had
to rearrange most of my organs.

12:47.900 --> 12:50.568
Oh, yeah. He dragged half
of Lois right out with him.

12:50.570 --> 12:52.903
Yeah, the doctors said I'll
be lucky if I live past 50,

12:52.905 --> 12:57.508
but Chris is healthy,
and I thank God for that.

13:00.879 --> 13:01.679
Oh, there you are, Brian.

13:01.681 --> 13:04.115
All right, you ready
to meet your clone?

13:04.117 --> 13:04.749
Am I ever?

13:04.751 --> 13:06.751
I've got a to-do list
three pages long for him.

13:06.753 --> 13:09.520
Okay, now I want to qualify
this by reminding you

13:09.522 --> 13:10.721
that, as with my clone,

13:10.723 --> 13:12.256
the intelligence level
is reduced a bit.

13:12.258 --> 13:14.024
That's good. We don't
want him thinking too much.

13:14.026 --> 13:16.160
Yeah, well, I might
have dialed yours back

13:16.162 --> 13:17.995
a little more
than I ought to have.

13:17.997 --> 13:18.996
What do you mean?

13:18.998 --> 13:19.997
Brian,
meet Bitch Brian.

13:19.999 --> 13:24.568
Hi, Brian. You got some stuff
you want me to do for you?

13:24.570 --> 13:25.703
Oh, my God.

13:25.705 --> 13:27.071
Yeah. That's kind of
what I said, too.

13:27.073 --> 13:28.973
You know, I'll-I'll be honest
with you, Brian.

13:28.975 --> 13:29.707
Here's what happened.

13:29.709 --> 13:31.008
I didn't really want
to do the work,

13:31.010 --> 13:32.910
so Bitch Stewie
sort of did it.

13:32.912 --> 13:35.112
Hey, Stewie,
how'd the clone turn out?

13:35.114 --> 13:38.182
Brian, I can't go
to the bathroom by myself.

13:38.184 --> 13:39.083
Will you please help me?

13:39.085 --> 13:41.685
But I'm good
at other stuff!

13:44.055 --> 13:46.524
(doorbell rings)

13:47.526 --> 13:48.692
Hello, Candy.

13:48.694 --> 13:49.994
Hi, Glenn.

13:49.996 --> 13:52.196
Come on in.

13:54.900 --> 13:57.168
(retro jazz tune plays)

14:00.572 --> 14:02.740
♪

14:23.094 --> 14:25.095
So, how long you been
in beauty school?

14:25.097 --> 14:25.796
Two months.

14:25.798 --> 14:28.065
Well, tonight
we're doing facials.

14:29.601 --> 14:30.634
(baby crying)

14:30.636 --> 14:34.038
Oh, God. Hang on a second.

14:34.873 --> 14:37.308
Okay, okay. Stop.
Just stop crying.

14:37.310 --> 14:38.275
Stop crying, Anna Lee.

14:38.277 --> 14:41.445
Oh, no wonder. You
dropped your pacifier.

14:42.514 --> 14:45.483
(buzzes)

14:47.819 --> 14:49.920
You have a baby?
Yeah. It's a long story.

14:49.922 --> 14:52.656
Damn kid's kept me up
every night for two weeks.

14:52.658 --> 14:54.158
Now, where were we?

14:54.160 --> 14:55.726
Giggity-giggity...

14:55.728 --> 14:58.596
(snoring)

15:05.470 --> 15:08.372
CANDY:
<i>Glenn, you fell asleep,</i>
<i>so I took off.</i>

15:08.374 --> 15:10.207
<i>It's probably for the best.</i>

15:10.209 --> 15:11.275
<i>I've never had sex before,</i>

15:11.277 --> 15:14.178
<i>and I probably wouldn't</i>
<i>have been much good at it.</i>

15:14.180 --> 15:15.746
(screaming)

15:15.748 --> 15:16.747
(Anna Lee crying)

15:16.749 --> 15:19.049
That's it.
That kid is out of here.

15:19.051 --> 15:20.718
Hey, there's another note.

15:20.720 --> 15:24.255
"Glenn, this is your child.
Next time wear a condom, jer..."

15:24.257 --> 15:27.758
Oh, that's the note
from earlier.

15:27.760 --> 15:28.726
I...

15:28.728 --> 15:30.594
need a file cabinet.

15:35.333 --> 15:38.335
So, it's just not working out,
me being a father.

15:38.337 --> 15:39.570
And that's why I'm wondering

15:39.572 --> 15:42.106
if you and Lois would be
willing to adopt the baby.

15:42.108 --> 15:43.374
Uh... Oh, boy, Quagmire.

15:43.376 --> 15:44.675
I-I don't know
that we can do that.

15:44.677 --> 15:47.011
We-we-we can barely take
care of the two we have.

15:47.013 --> 15:48.445
Now-Now, this is
just a suggestion.

15:48.447 --> 15:51.782
Just throwing it out there.
Have you considered abortion?

15:51.784 --> 15:53.717
Uh, Peter, I think
it's too late for that.

15:53.719 --> 15:55.886
Oh, don't let the press
put the scare into you.

15:55.888 --> 15:57.821
Wade v. Boggs has
not been overturned.

15:57.823 --> 16:00.724
Yeah, but you can't really
abort a live baby.

16:00.726 --> 16:03.127
Ho, boy, they have got you.

16:03.129 --> 16:04.295
Glenn, Glenn.

16:04.297 --> 16:05.829
(whispering):
Give her back to God.

16:05.831 --> 16:08.399
Peter, I'm going to go ahead and
move the conversation forward.

16:08.401 --> 16:11.035
Is there any way
you guys could take Anna Lee?

16:11.037 --> 16:11.969
No, Quagmire.

16:11.971 --> 16:13.137
We got enough kids
of our own,

16:13.139 --> 16:14.705
plus ol' Brian over there.

16:14.707 --> 16:15.472
Right, buddy?

16:15.474 --> 16:17.241
I sharpened a
pencil in my bum

16:17.243 --> 16:19.877
and now I need
a Band-Aid.

16:24.316 --> 16:26.050
You're doing
the right thing, Quagmire.

16:26.052 --> 16:28.118
All right, Quagmire, just so
you're clear on the law,

16:28.120 --> 16:31.188
once you give this child up
to the adoption agency,

16:31.190 --> 16:34.058
you can no longer abort it.

16:34.060 --> 16:34.959
Hello, sir.

16:34.961 --> 16:37.127
Do you wish to put this
child up for adoption?

16:37.129 --> 16:38.228
Yeah.
It's not working out.

16:38.230 --> 16:39.396
I need to get her
out of my hair.

16:39.398 --> 16:40.864
Well, we can
help you there.

16:40.866 --> 16:42.066
Is it a boy or a girl?

16:42.068 --> 16:44.435
It's a girl.
Her name's Anna Lee.

16:44.437 --> 16:45.736
Oh, beautiful name.

16:45.738 --> 16:47.638
Let me take her from you.

16:50.842 --> 16:53.844
Well, go on, Quagmire.
Give her the baby.

16:53.846 --> 16:55.112
I-I will.

16:55.114 --> 16:56.947
I-I just...

16:58.917 --> 17:00.851
Oh...

17:00.853 --> 17:01.318
Here.

17:01.320 --> 17:05.456
She, uh... She'll go
to a good home, right?

17:05.458 --> 17:06.256
Oh, yes.

17:06.258 --> 17:07.257
She'll be
somewhere safe, right?

17:07.259 --> 17:10.294
Like, you're not going to put
her with sand people, right?

17:10.296 --> 17:12.329
You mean like
from <i>Star Wars?</i>

17:12.331 --> 17:15.099
(laughs)
No, no, no, no, no.

17:17.302 --> 17:20.504
Brian, I didn't know if
you wanted a God's eye,

17:20.506 --> 17:21.972
but I made you one.

17:21.974 --> 17:23.007
Uh...

17:23.009 --> 17:24.141
Okay, thank you.

17:24.143 --> 17:26.076
Did you wash my car,
like I asked?

17:26.078 --> 17:28.012
No, but I hit it
with a rock.

17:28.014 --> 17:29.179
Okay, thanks.

17:29.181 --> 17:32.383
Brian, I think my jaw
is falling off.

17:32.385 --> 17:33.417
Oh! Oh, G...

17:33.419 --> 17:34.852
Stewie, what is happening
to this thing?!

17:34.854 --> 17:37.821
Oh, yeah. Turns out the clones
aren't too stable, Brian.

17:37.823 --> 17:39.456
I've been having
some trouble with mine, too.

17:39.458 --> 17:42.960
Hey, Stewie, everything sounds
like rushing water.

17:42.962 --> 17:45.162
And I can't stand up
so very good.

17:45.164 --> 17:47.164
Yeah, I figure they've got
less than a minute

17:47.166 --> 17:48.799
before they
dissolve completely.

17:48.801 --> 17:51.001
Hey, Brian?
Knock-knock.

17:51.003 --> 17:52.336
Who's there?

17:52.338 --> 17:53.771
(passes gas)

17:53.773 --> 17:56.073
(laughing)

17:57.075 --> 18:00.711
Whoa. I hope
that doesn't happen to me.

18:01.880 --> 18:02.880
He took my dry cleaning

18:02.882 --> 18:05.049
and I have no idea
what he did with the ticket.

18:05.051 --> 18:07.051
Yeah, this was not
a fruitful endeavor.

18:07.053 --> 18:11.255
I'm not proud of this,
but I need to lick that up.

18:13.958 --> 18:16.193
(hard rock playing)

18:16.594 --> 18:17.995
This will be great,
Quagmire.

18:17.997 --> 18:20.364
A nudie bar is
the perfect way to celebrate

18:20.366 --> 18:21.865
your first night
without a baby.

18:21.867 --> 18:23.233
Yeah, Peter,
this is great.

18:23.235 --> 18:24.034
I feel like myself again.

18:24.036 --> 18:26.970
I'll tell ya, my life was
so dominated by that baby.

18:26.972 --> 18:28.138
I'm glad she's gone.

18:28.140 --> 18:29.273
Eh, you know sometimes,
you just got

18:29.275 --> 18:30.541
to make a decision
and go with it.

18:30.543 --> 18:34.044
Like when I decided to try
that radical penis enlargement.

18:35.246 --> 18:36.180
Peter, I don't think...

18:36.182 --> 18:38.082
Brian, your objections
are duly noted.

18:38.084 --> 18:39.383
Now hit the gas!

18:39.385 --> 18:41.351
(tires squealing)

18:41.353 --> 18:42.586
(loud snapping)

18:43.254 --> 18:45.823
You know that would never work
again in a million years.

18:45.825 --> 18:47.925
Don't need it to, Brian.

18:49.928 --> 18:52.329
Heh. That stripper
has a rash on her ass,

18:52.331 --> 18:54.364
just like Anna Lee
used to get.

18:54.366 --> 18:55.032
Uh, yeah.

18:55.034 --> 18:57.501
And that other stripper's
sitting on that guy's lap,

18:57.503 --> 18:59.837
just like Anna Lee used to do.

18:59.839 --> 19:00.204
I guess.

19:00.206 --> 19:03.540
And that stripper only has
one tooth, just like Anna Lee.

19:03.542 --> 19:05.442
Quagmire,
you feeling okay?

19:05.444 --> 19:06.176
I don't know.

19:06.178 --> 19:08.445
I think I might have
made a terrible mistake.

19:08.447 --> 19:10.180
I abandoned my daughter!

19:10.182 --> 19:13.150
Why did I give away
my only daughter?!

19:13.152 --> 19:15.119
(sobbing):
Oh...

19:15.121 --> 19:17.321
Oh, God.

19:17.323 --> 19:18.956
(sobbing)

19:18.958 --> 19:20.023
He'll be fine.

19:20.025 --> 19:21.391
We shouldn't let this
ruin our night.

19:21.393 --> 19:23.894
Let's just enjoy
the strippers.

19:23.896 --> 19:24.228
I guess.

19:24.230 --> 19:26.563
I just hate the way that one
gets so into her work.

19:26.565 --> 19:28.599
You boys have
been very naughty.

19:28.601 --> 19:32.236
I'm going to have to
assign you extra homework.

19:32.238 --> 19:35.172
Darn it.
Fractions are so hard.

19:35.174 --> 19:36.507
What did you get
for number four?

19:36.509 --> 19:39.076
She said, "Don't
share answers"!

19:41.846 --> 19:44.081
All right, here
it is: 625 Maple.

19:44.083 --> 19:46.483
That's the family
that adopted Anna Lee.

19:48.086 --> 19:49.319
Hey, wait, wait.
Guys?!

19:49.321 --> 19:54.625
Well, it's just me
and my old nemesis, First Step.

19:54.627 --> 19:55.592
(laughing)

19:55.594 --> 19:56.960
Hey, Joe, what you doing?

19:56.962 --> 19:58.128
You out for a walk?

19:58.130 --> 20:00.264
I hate this block.

20:02.066 --> 20:03.400
(gasps)
There she is!

20:03.402 --> 20:04.968
There's Anna Lee!

20:07.005 --> 20:08.972
Hang on, Anna Lee.
I'm coming.

20:08.974 --> 20:10.340
(grunting)

20:11.376 --> 20:13.377
(gasps)
It's them.

20:21.386 --> 20:22.452
Look at her.

20:22.454 --> 20:24.488
She looks so happy.

20:24.490 --> 20:27.524
Almost like she belongs there.

20:27.526 --> 20:30.227
They look like a real family.

20:30.229 --> 20:33.230
I can't take her
away from this.

20:33.232 --> 20:34.431
JOE:
What's happening?!

20:34.433 --> 20:35.966
He's not going
to go through with it!

20:35.968 --> 20:39.303
It's a nice family and the kid
will be better off here!

20:39.305 --> 20:40.370
Aw, that's sweet!

20:40.372 --> 20:42.606
What's the inside
of the house look like?!

20:42.608 --> 20:44.441
Colonial!
Furniture's pretty good!

20:44.443 --> 20:46.443
Possibly imported area rug!

20:46.445 --> 20:47.144
Oh, that's nice!

20:47.146 --> 20:49.446
A bit pricey, but for
the money you're spending,

20:49.448 --> 20:51.582
you know, it's not
a bad way to go!

20:51.584 --> 20:52.616
Yeah, for the money!

20:52.618 --> 20:54.218
You ready to go, Quagmire?

20:54.220 --> 20:54.885
Yeah.

20:54.887 --> 20:57.254
You know, I got to tell you,
I think you did a good thing.

20:57.256 --> 21:00.257
Well, I guess I just realized
it's not about me.

21:00.259 --> 21:03.327
This family is what's
best for Anna Lee.

21:03.329 --> 21:05.329
This is her home now.

21:05.331 --> 21:06.597
I got to let her go.

21:06.599 --> 21:08.131
I'm proud of you, Quagmire.

21:08.133 --> 21:09.433
Thanks, man.
Hey, who knows?

21:09.435 --> 21:11.635
Maybe I'll bump
into her in 18 years.

21:11.637 --> 21:12.269
What?!

21:12.271 --> 21:14.938
Did you really think I was
going to change that much?

21:14.940 --> 21:17.274
Good night, everybody!
