00:03.026 --> 00:07.696
It is hard raising
a mixed-race child.

00:07.698 --> 00:09.197
Who's Fauna Hodel, Mama?

00:09.199 --> 00:11.299
You.
You're Fauna Hodel.

00:11.301 --> 00:13.568
I'm leaving.
I'm gonna find my real family.

00:13.570 --> 00:15.370
What brings you to Los Angeles?

00:15.372 --> 00:17.172
I'm visiting my grandfather.

00:17.174 --> 00:18.273
I've never met him.

00:18.275 --> 00:19.541
Well, that will interesting.

00:19.543 --> 00:21.309
You... You're the one
that wrote that article

00:21.311 --> 00:23.712
- about Dr. George Hodel?
- George Hodel? Yes.

00:23.714 --> 00:25.547
<i>You were right about him.
Got to keep looking.</i>

00:25.549 --> 00:29.885
Your grandfather
is a very dangerous man.

00:29.887 --> 00:31.586
Stay away from him.

00:47.304 --> 00:48.870
Pat!

00:48.872 --> 00:50.505
There you are!

00:50.507 --> 00:52.440
Come on!

00:52.442 --> 00:54.910
Girls, your cousin is here!

00:54.912 --> 00:56.578
Patta's here!

00:56.580 --> 00:58.580
What are you doing here?

00:58.582 --> 01:00.982
He asked me to come, Tina.

01:00.984 --> 01:02.384
It's probably just
a mix-up is all.

01:02.386 --> 01:04.553
Tina can take you on the bus.

01:04.555 --> 01:07.289
The number 71
will take you up there.

01:07.291 --> 01:08.890
I don't want to go
all the way across town.

01:08.892 --> 01:10.292
I got plans tonight.

01:10.294 --> 01:12.761
How you gonna be so mean
to your cousin?

01:12.763 --> 01:14.963
It's gonna take two hours
to get there, Big Momma.

01:14.965 --> 01:16.898
Oh come on, Tina.
Don't be a flake!

01:16.900 --> 01:18.200
I'll get lost.

01:18.202 --> 01:20.235
Why you gonna leave her stranded
like that?

01:20.237 --> 01:21.836
Of course you're gonna take her.

01:21.838 --> 01:23.738
Yes, Big Momma.

01:23.740 --> 01:25.674
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

02:20.163 --> 02:21.496
Oh, no, no, no.
Not today, ma'am.

02:21.498 --> 02:23.164
I paid, I paid.
Open this goddamn door.

02:23.166 --> 02:24.733
No, no. She does... You never pay.
I have money.

02:24.735 --> 02:26.334
How do you know
she don't have any money?

02:26.336 --> 02:27.669
- Get off my bus!
- I have money!

02:27.671 --> 02:29.371
- I'll pay for her.
- Get off my bus!

02:29.373 --> 02:31.973
- I said I'll pay for her.
- Unless you gonna pay.

02:40.017 --> 02:41.583
Oh, Jesus Christ.

02:41.585 --> 02:43.685
You should see the other girl.
I kicked her ass.

02:43.687 --> 02:45.920
Not a scratch on her.

02:45.922 --> 02:47.188
So, uh, what are doing here?

02:47.190 --> 02:48.657
Eating grapes off the wallpaper?

02:48.659 --> 02:50.725
Janice Brewster on the slab.
Plus 400 words.

02:50.727 --> 02:52.127
Better late than never.

02:52.129 --> 02:54.562
But I got something so much
better than this garbage, Peter.

02:54.564 --> 02:55.897
It's gonna blow your hair back.

02:55.899 --> 02:57.499
I got an anonymous phone call
last night.

02:57.501 --> 02:59.801
You'll never guess
who it's about.

02:59.803 --> 03:01.002
Who?

03:01.004 --> 03:02.837
Dr. George Hodel.

03:02.839 --> 03:05.440
Nuts.

03:05.442 --> 03:07.742
- No, it's Dr. George Hodel.
- Ah shit, Jay, that...

03:07.744 --> 03:09.644
I am telling you,
I got a feeling...

03:09.646 --> 03:11.279
- You know...
- ...something is up.

03:11.281 --> 03:13.048
This call means something.

03:13.050 --> 03:14.516
There's a crack.

03:14.518 --> 03:18.053
Okay Jay, first of all,
that trial was 10 lifetimes ago.

03:18.055 --> 03:19.454
And second,
you already tried this.

03:19.456 --> 03:21.756
- He walked. End of story.
- Okay, but what if the...

03:21.758 --> 03:23.391
What if the phone call
has new information?

03:23.393 --> 03:25.126
What if she has
n-new information?

03:25.128 --> 03:26.561
You want me to mess around
with a libel case

03:26.563 --> 03:28.296
that nearly took down
an entire paper?

03:28.298 --> 03:29.998
I'd like you to mess around
with the truth, Peter.

03:30.000 --> 03:32.734
Because this... this...
It <i> is</i> the truth.

03:32.736 --> 03:35.136
- I know it's the truth.
- Oh, y... oh, you know it?

03:35.138 --> 03:36.738
Okay, but Hodel's daughter,
Tamar...

03:36.740 --> 03:37.839
Is that her name?

03:37.841 --> 03:40.408
She took it back, Jay,
in the end. Am I right?

03:40.410 --> 03:41.776
That's what <i> they</i> said.
Then I couldn't find her.

03:41.778 --> 03:43.712
They shipped her off to a convent.
Yeah.

03:43.714 --> 03:45.880
Mm. What if this phone
call was Tamar Hodel?

03:45.882 --> 03:48.416
And what would she say?
We got to find out.

03:48.418 --> 03:51.219
I am not jumping in
a bag of snakes with you, Jay.

03:51.221 --> 03:53.922
I am not doing it.
You ain't a kid anymore, Jay.

03:53.924 --> 03:56.858
You know that stunt you pulled?
You didn't just screw yourself.

03:56.860 --> 03:59.060
You know that? Decent guys
got shit-canned because of that.

03:59.062 --> 04:00.295
Of course...
Of course I know that!

04:00.297 --> 04:01.796
Joe Kline
drank himself to death.

04:01.798 --> 04:03.298
- God, of course I...
- Are you friggin' kidding me?

04:03.300 --> 04:04.766
You don't think I know that
every day?

04:04.768 --> 04:06.501
It is so easy for you.

04:06.503 --> 04:09.104
It is so easy.

04:09.106 --> 04:12.307
I lost my entire life...

04:12.309 --> 04:14.542
And th... and those guys,

04:14.544 --> 04:17.612
yeah, they got... they...
They got screwed, fine, sure.

04:17.613 --> 04:19.414
But I...

04:19.416 --> 04:24.018
But I was telling the...
What was right, Peter.

04:25.922 --> 04:29.157
And then they string me up
as a liar and a faker forever?

04:29.159 --> 04:31.479
What f... what game are we in?

04:35.065 --> 04:38.600
If I could just...

04:38.602 --> 04:40.201
If I could just prove it...

04:40.203 --> 04:42.337
No. No.

04:42.339 --> 04:43.772
- ...even... even a... even a...
- No.

04:43.774 --> 04:45.206
But...
But even just a part of it.

04:45.208 --> 04:46.374
- No. No.
- Even just a part of it.

04:46.376 --> 04:48.343
No.
A thousand times no.

04:48.345 --> 04:49.844
You can't prove it.

04:49.846 --> 04:51.146
You already tried.

04:51.148 --> 04:52.647
You can't.

04:52.649 --> 04:55.750
Come on, Jay.
Power never changes.

04:55.752 --> 04:59.454
You run with those dogs again,
they'll bury you 10 feet deep.

04:59.456 --> 05:03.491
It's got nothing to do with
right or wrong or the truth.

05:03.493 --> 05:06.661
You got to remember
who runs this city.

05:06.663 --> 05:09.464
Justice in this town
is a protection racket.

05:09.466 --> 05:12.534
You can't fix it because
it's already fixed, man.

05:12.536 --> 05:14.803
The fix is in,
and it's not gonna change.

05:14.805 --> 05:17.372
George Hodel?
Are you kidding me?

05:17.374 --> 05:20.875
It was all some far-out stuff,
Jay.

05:20.877 --> 05:22.377
I mean, his daughter...

05:22.379 --> 05:25.513
She came across twitchy,
hysterical,

05:25.515 --> 05:28.149
like the Salem witch trials.

05:28.151 --> 05:29.584
Right?

05:29.586 --> 05:33.455
She accused him of that murder,
that crazy murder.

05:33.457 --> 05:35.990
I mean, Hodel might be
a lot of things,

05:35.992 --> 05:38.593
but he sure as hell
isn't the bogeyman.

05:53.610 --> 05:55.043
Go on.

06:32.649 --> 06:34.382
Come on, let's go home.

06:34.384 --> 06:37.118
Ain't nobody here.

06:43.894 --> 06:46.060
Hello?

06:49.666 --> 06:52.200
Hello?

06:52.202 --> 06:56.037
Dr. Hodel?

06:58.041 --> 07:00.308
Dr. Hodel?

07:03.380 --> 07:06.681
But he told me to come.

07:10.120 --> 07:12.053
Come on, let's go home.

07:12.055 --> 07:14.422
This is bullshit.
Ain't nobody here.

07:14.424 --> 07:16.257
Come on.
We got someplace else to be.

07:16.259 --> 07:18.860
I don't understand.

07:18.862 --> 07:21.262
Tina, he asked me to come here.

07:21.264 --> 07:24.832
Patta, come on.

07:47.090 --> 07:49.123
Terrence Shye!

07:51.761 --> 07:52.927
Hello!

07:52.929 --> 07:53.761
Hey, hey.

07:53.763 --> 07:55.129
- I am good.
- Good, good.

07:55.131 --> 07:58.633
This is my cousin, Pat.
I mean Fauna.

07:58.635 --> 08:00.468
She in from Nevada
for a few days.

08:00.470 --> 08:01.603
She's staying with us.

08:01.605 --> 08:02.904
Hey. Hey, Fauna.

08:02.906 --> 08:04.505
Hi.

08:04.507 --> 08:06.374
This is Nero.

08:06.376 --> 08:08.109
All right, Fauna.

08:08.111 --> 08:10.545
- Jodie!
- You know, I love me a cousin.

08:10.547 --> 08:12.680
Hold up, hold up, hold up,
hold up, hold up.

08:12.682 --> 08:14.515
What you mean by cousin?

08:14.517 --> 08:16.384
She my cousin.

08:16.386 --> 08:17.885
How she gon' be your cousin?

08:17.887 --> 08:21.389
Her mama is my auntie.
So we cousins.

08:22.692 --> 08:23.958
Yeah, but she ain't...

08:23.960 --> 08:27.295
She black.
She mixed though.

08:27.297 --> 08:30.031
No she ain't.
There ain't no way.

08:30.033 --> 08:32.166
- With them eyes?
- Hey, man, leave her alone.

08:32.168 --> 08:34.568
Ain't no colored girl.
Let me see your hands.

08:34.571 --> 08:36.638
I've got my birth certificate.

08:36.640 --> 08:38.206
$10 to see it.

08:38.207 --> 08:39.807
Shit.

08:39.808 --> 08:41.775
I'll give you more than $10 if
you want to give me a kiss.

08:41.778 --> 08:42.977
- Leave her alone.
- Come on, now...

08:42.979 --> 08:44.212
- No.
- ...don't play hard to get.

08:44.214 --> 08:45.480
No.

08:47.484 --> 08:49.083
I need it for one room.

08:49.085 --> 08:50.718
Look, he got three jobs
and still can't get a room.

08:50.720 --> 08:52.453
- He can't get a job.
- He can't get a job.

08:52.455 --> 08:53.621
Do you have the education?

08:53.623 --> 08:55.690
I got the education, miss.

08:55.692 --> 08:57.158
Well, then I don't know
what your problem is.

08:57.160 --> 08:59.394
- And you have a job?
- Yes. I'm working.

08:59.396 --> 09:01.496
Oh, we're working too. Congratulations.
And I'm paying my rent.

09:01.498 --> 09:03.297
- Are you?
- -I'm trying.

09:03.299 --> 09:04.432
I love your hair.

09:04.434 --> 09:05.833
Thanks.

09:05.835 --> 09:08.136
All that relaxer and hot comb?
You don't need it.

09:08.138 --> 09:11.406
"I-I-If any white man
in the world says"

09:11.408 --> 09:12.640
give me liberty
or give me death,

09:12.642 --> 09:14.075
the entire white world applauds,

09:14.077 --> 09:16.577
but a black man says
exactly the same thing,

09:16.579 --> 09:19.280
"th-then he's judged a criminal
and treated like one."

09:19.282 --> 09:22.750
Now you just stealing that from...
How you doin'?

09:22.752 --> 09:24.552
You gonna act like
you don't hear me now?

09:24.554 --> 09:26.554
Hey, come sit by me, sister.

09:26.556 --> 09:28.656
Come on.

09:28.658 --> 09:31.726
Ignore that fool.

09:33.863 --> 09:36.431
Need a drink?

09:36.433 --> 09:37.765
No, thank you.

09:37.767 --> 09:39.867
I've seen it change
too many people.

09:39.869 --> 09:42.336
Starts in laughter,
ends in tears.

09:42.338 --> 09:45.506
Well, what are you doin' here?

09:45.508 --> 09:46.741
Flashing your birth certificate
around,

09:46.743 --> 09:49.410
it seems like hard work.

09:49.412 --> 09:51.779
Well, it's...
it's a long story.

09:51.781 --> 09:54.282
I'll give you three sentences.

09:54.284 --> 09:56.451
Well, uh...

09:56.453 --> 09:58.086
I found out I'm adopted.

09:58.088 --> 10:02.156
My white family, or at least
my white grandfather,

10:02.158 --> 10:03.958
he's here in Los Angeles.

10:03.960 --> 10:07.562
I've come to find my real mother
who gave me up.

10:07.564 --> 10:09.864
Or my father.

10:09.866 --> 10:11.632
Well, that's more than
three sentences.

10:11.634 --> 10:14.402
Yes, it was.

10:15.772 --> 10:17.805
Told you it was a long story.

10:17.807 --> 10:20.241
So your father is black?

10:20.243 --> 10:22.477
Mm-hmm.

10:23.947 --> 10:25.780
That's all it takes, huh?

10:25.782 --> 10:28.302
Just that one drop
will hold you down forever.

10:36.893 --> 10:39.293
Yeah, maybe I'll find him.

10:40.463 --> 10:42.196
I think you will.

10:48.538 --> 10:49.837
I think y'all are both having

10:49.839 --> 10:51.372
a little bit too much
of a good time.

10:51.374 --> 10:53.207
She knows I'm a soldier
though. She knows I'm...

10:53.209 --> 10:55.009
- 'Cause you weren't there.
- You know.

10:55.011 --> 10:56.644
These... these are... Look.
I walk straight. I'm not...

10:56.646 --> 10:58.479
You're not... You're not
walking straight, man.

10:58.481 --> 10:59.647
You're not walking straight.

10:59.649 --> 11:01.482
This is straight.
This is straight.

11:01.484 --> 11:03.918
What you were doing before
was not straight.

11:03.920 --> 11:05.753
Xander, come on, now.

11:05.755 --> 11:07.588
You know you can't
walk straight.

11:07.590 --> 11:08.923
...He ain't lyin'.

11:08.925 --> 11:10.925
- I love y'all.
- You can't.

11:10.927 --> 11:14.862
...You got that right.

11:33.783 --> 11:36.250
Fauna! Come on!

12:00.992 --> 12:02.458
Hey, Lilly.

12:02.460 --> 12:03.959
Come on. Wake up.

12:05.830 --> 12:07.930
Hey, doll.

12:07.932 --> 12:08.964
HI.

12:08.966 --> 12:10.599
I was just hoping
that we could...

12:10.601 --> 12:11.867
- Come on.
- ...you know...

12:11.869 --> 12:13.569
- Come on. Come on.
- I was thinkin'...

12:13.571 --> 12:16.305
- Hi. Hi.
- There you go.

12:26.784 --> 12:28.083
I just wanted to see you.

12:28.085 --> 12:30.352
I know.
Of course you did.

12:36.060 --> 12:38.060
Come on.

12:38.062 --> 12:40.196
No, no, no.
No, no, no.

12:40.198 --> 12:41.530
No, no, no. No.

12:41.532 --> 12:43.999
No, Lilly.

12:44.001 --> 12:46.669
Lilly, no.

13:14.866 --> 13:19.201
Where are you, Tamar?

13:28.279 --> 13:32.181
No, no, no, no.

13:36.988 --> 13:38.537
God.

13:41.876 --> 13:46.078
Why, you are all twisted up.

13:46.080 --> 13:49.281
I'm great.
Never better.

13:49.283 --> 13:52.184
Never better.

13:52.186 --> 13:53.452
What happened, Jay?

13:53.454 --> 13:55.554
Convent.
Why a convent?

13:55.556 --> 13:58.991
We had the world by the balls,
didn't we?

13:58.993 --> 14:00.926
I thought we did.

14:03.598 --> 14:05.864
I thought we did.

14:05.866 --> 14:07.499
Here's the crazy thing, Lilly.

14:07.501 --> 14:09.935
I feel like I could, uh,
I feel like I could fix it,

14:09.937 --> 14:12.271
- like I could get it back.
- Oh, God.

14:12.273 --> 14:17.543
I was gonna be this big hotshot
hot-shit reporter,

14:17.545 --> 14:22.314
and then I got tangled up
in this George Hodel story,

14:22.316 --> 14:25.985
and it... man...

14:25.987 --> 14:27.620
It just...

14:27.622 --> 14:29.855
It destroyed everything
in its path,

14:29.857 --> 14:34.760
like, uh...
like a biblical plague,

14:34.762 --> 14:39.098
like a, uh...

14:39.100 --> 14:41.567
like a devil's shadow,

14:41.569 --> 14:46.939
blackening the grass
it falls upon.

14:46.941 --> 14:49.508
I was supposed to be an actress.

14:49.510 --> 14:52.444
I can prove everything
if I find that daughter.

14:52.446 --> 14:56.248
So go find the daughter.

14:56.250 --> 15:00.352
But she was hiding secrets.

15:00.354 --> 15:02.321
I'll find her.

15:02.323 --> 15:05.624
And I'll nail the story to
the goddamn doors of the <i> Times.</i>

15:05.626 --> 15:08.927
Like Martin Luther, right?

15:08.929 --> 15:11.630
"The Redemption and Resurrection
of Jay Singletary,"

15:11.632 --> 15:14.299
by Jay Singletary.

15:14.301 --> 15:16.435
Are you holding, baby?

15:16.437 --> 15:17.770
Hey, Lilly, you get around.

15:17.772 --> 15:19.705
You must have some nun friends,
don't you?

15:19.707 --> 15:21.874
That's your kind of gang, huh?

15:21.876 --> 15:23.942
What are you talking about?

15:23.944 --> 15:28.447
This daughter got sent
to a convent... Tamar.

15:28.449 --> 15:31.417
Does that name ring a bell?
Tamar Hodel?

15:31.419 --> 15:33.752
Jesus, she must be 30 by now.

15:33.754 --> 15:35.487
I don't even know
if she's still there.

15:35.489 --> 15:37.923
Do nuns move?

15:37.925 --> 15:40.492
You're a loser.

15:40.494 --> 15:43.062
Give me five bucks for a cab.

15:43.064 --> 15:46.999
You want cab fare?

15:47.001 --> 15:48.167
Huh?

15:48.169 --> 15:49.334
Yeah.

15:49.336 --> 15:50.969
I'm gonna call you a cab.

15:50.971 --> 15:54.106
No. You know what?
Just give me the money. I'll...

15:54.108 --> 15:55.841
- Here.
- I'll get it.

15:55.843 --> 15:58.410
Yeah.

15:58.412 --> 16:00.012
You want me to stay?

16:00.014 --> 16:01.313
Let me call... let me j...
Let me call you a cab.

16:01.315 --> 16:02.681
Screw you, asshole.

16:02.683 --> 16:03.982
Lilly, come on.
I don't want to do this shit.

16:03.984 --> 16:06.024
- I know you're holding.
- I'm not. I...

16:09.590 --> 16:11.824
- Screw you, Jay!
- What?! What?!

16:13.594 --> 16:14.827
- You turned me on.
- I didn't turn you...

16:14.829 --> 16:16.195
I didn't stick a needle
into my arm.

16:16.197 --> 16:18.597
That is your creature-feature,
sweetheart.

16:22.903 --> 16:25.170
Yeah, frailty,
thy name is woman!

16:25.172 --> 16:26.905
You know that one?!

16:38.853 --> 16:41.153
Well, now.
Good morning.

16:41.155 --> 16:42.621
Good morning.

16:42.623 --> 16:45.023
Some night, huh?

16:45.025 --> 16:48.193
Yeah.

16:48.195 --> 16:49.762
Y'all have fun?

16:49.764 --> 16:51.997
Yeah, it was nice.

16:54.301 --> 16:56.335
Tina still sleeping?

16:56.337 --> 16:58.470
Uh, yes, ma'am.

17:01.842 --> 17:04.041
So what you gonna do now, girl?

17:04.044 --> 17:06.411
Did Jimmy Lee...

17:06.413 --> 17:10.715
Did she ever say anything about
my... my real mama?

17:10.718 --> 17:12.951
Jimmy Lee is your real mama.

17:12.953 --> 17:16.054
If all you want to
talk about is blood,

17:16.056 --> 17:19.758
then, no, I don't know nothin'
about your adoption.

17:19.760 --> 17:22.528
But I know that
Jimmy Lee loves you.

17:22.530 --> 17:24.829
Yeah, I know.
And I love her.

17:24.832 --> 17:28.433
We just fight so awful.

17:28.435 --> 17:30.869
Well, everybody fights
with Jimmy Lee.

17:30.871 --> 17:34.206
She fights the entire world,
sugar.

17:34.208 --> 17:36.809
But that's just family.

17:36.811 --> 17:38.277
That's just life.

17:38.279 --> 17:40.679
Yeah, I know.
It's just...

17:40.681 --> 17:43.348
It's hard not to wonder.

17:43.350 --> 17:44.850
We're just so different.

17:44.852 --> 17:46.151
<i>I'm</i> different.

17:46.153 --> 17:47.386
I'm tired of it,

17:47.388 --> 17:49.721
and even when she's telling me
that, you know,

17:49.723 --> 17:52.457
"you're different
than everybody else."

17:52.459 --> 17:54.293
If I could just find
my real mom and dad,

17:54.295 --> 17:56.361
then maybe I wouldn't be.

17:56.363 --> 17:59.331
You know, if could just see 'em.

17:59.333 --> 18:03.068
Baby, you are welcome
to stay here

18:03.070 --> 18:06.505
till Jimmy Lee
comes knocking heads.

18:08.042 --> 18:09.842
Ooh.
What about that... that...

18:09.844 --> 18:11.877
That... that...
That Terrence Shye?

18:14.782 --> 18:18.317
Ain't he something?

18:20.754 --> 18:22.821
He's a good boy.

18:22.823 --> 18:28.060
You know, Nina and Tina
have known him for 10 years.

18:28.062 --> 18:31.830
I keep saying one of them
should marry that boy.

18:34.668 --> 18:37.169
Hello?

18:38.539 --> 18:40.505
Hold on.

18:40.507 --> 18:42.708
It's for you.

18:42.710 --> 18:44.943
Hello? Dr. Hodel?

18:44.945 --> 18:47.045
<i>Hey, girl. How you doin'?</i>

18:47.047 --> 18:48.947
<i>I bet you ain't know
I had this number, huh?</i>

18:48.949 --> 18:50.382
<i>Hey, listen.
Why don't you, uh...</i>

18:50.384 --> 18:52.251
<i>Why don't you come out
with me tonight?</i>

18:52.253 --> 18:54.386
<i>- I'll take you to a movie or...</i>
- No thank you, Nero. Uh...

18:54.388 --> 18:56.688
<i>Listen, I'm telling you now,
don't play hard to get with me.</i>

18:56.690 --> 18:58.290
Is this that Nero?

18:58.292 --> 19:01.727
Don't be messing with my girls,
Nero.

19:03.030 --> 19:05.330
I'm sorry.
I-I didn't give him your number.

19:05.332 --> 19:07.933
I-I gave it to my grandfather
because I didn't have a number.

19:07.935 --> 19:10.202
It's all right.
It's all right.

19:10.204 --> 19:15.274
Honey, I have known Nero
for years.

19:15.276 --> 19:18.210
Bad apple, rotten tree.

19:49.525 --> 19:51.158
No. You said "office."
I went to King Eddy's.

19:51.160 --> 19:52.993
I didn't know you had
an actual, uh...

19:52.995 --> 19:54.728
- ...No.
- ...uh, closet.

19:54.730 --> 19:57.431
Sit. Sit. It's kind of
embarrassing, Peter, honestly.

19:57.433 --> 19:59.733
No.
No. No.

19:59.735 --> 20:01.902
I really like what you've done
with the place. It's...

20:01.904 --> 20:04.071
Yeah.
Okay, fantastic.

20:04.073 --> 20:06.039
Bye. Goodbye.

20:06.041 --> 20:09.143
Okay, I was having a good day,

20:09.145 --> 20:12.513
doing good deeds,
but you screwed me.

20:12.515 --> 20:14.248
What the hell
are you talking about?

20:14.250 --> 20:16.984
You messed up, jackass. No, I didn't.
I gave you a great story.

20:16.986 --> 20:19.186
Mnh-mnh. Janice Brewster...
the girl in the morgue? Yeah.

20:19.188 --> 20:21.755
Yeah, she was turning tricks
on Hollywood and Vine.

20:21.757 --> 20:23.223
Confirmed by LAPD.

20:23.225 --> 20:24.391
Ah, sh...

20:24.393 --> 20:26.026
I... Shit, Peter.

20:26.028 --> 20:28.629
I mean, I don't know.
Her mother didn't know.

20:28.631 --> 20:30.564
And I don't know what to tell you.
Yeah, I'm shocked.

20:30.566 --> 20:34.835
Guess what? You're scooped by
the <i> Sun Examiner.</i>

20:37.139 --> 20:38.939
"Bloody Romeo
Slays Ingenue."

20:38.941 --> 20:41.175
So the "Bloody Romeo" I'm guessing
is the... Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

20:41.177 --> 20:42.576
He's the gentleman who killed
Janice. Yeah?

20:42.578 --> 20:44.211
That's actually good.
Bevo Means coined that.

20:44.213 --> 20:46.413
She's clever. It's not... It's not...
It's not great.

20:46.415 --> 20:48.148
It's got a real
old Hollywood feel to it.

20:48.150 --> 20:49.349
It's just bad.

20:49.351 --> 20:51.552
Now, late last night,
this came in.

20:51.554 --> 20:53.620
The fuzz picked up
"Brody Stiles" in Watts.

20:53.622 --> 20:55.622
He copped to killed Janice,
I guess,

20:55.624 --> 20:57.424
after
"intensive questioning."

20:57.426 --> 20:59.793
Right, because
no one would admit

20:59.795 --> 21:01.962
to something they didn't do.
Well, you know, got to be a reason

21:01.964 --> 21:03.964
- they liked him for it, right?
- He's an easy collar.

21:03.966 --> 21:05.332
You fix it.

21:05.334 --> 21:07.668
Start with Brody Stiles
and do the goddamn work.

21:07.670 --> 21:09.536
- Report something, Jay, okay?
- I will.

21:09.538 --> 21:11.605
Show me you ain't like every
other goof I got working for me

21:11.607 --> 21:14.475
who makes one flippin' phone
call and calls it a day, okay?

21:14.477 --> 21:15.876
- Find a new angle.
- Did a goof do this?

21:15.878 --> 21:17.344
This is talent.
This is... th... y...

21:17.346 --> 21:19.046
- This is my lens.
- Find a new angle...

21:19.048 --> 21:22.182
Angry Negro fed up with society,
oversexed white girl,

21:22.184 --> 21:24.184
I don't care,
but it better sing.

21:24.186 --> 21:26.286
You know what? You're competing
with the <i> Sun Examiner.</i>

21:26.288 --> 21:27.554
You know what
I'm gonna give you?

21:27.556 --> 21:28.922
I'm gonna give you
a tight, clean 300

21:28.924 --> 21:31.892
about how she was abducted
by space aliens.

21:31.894 --> 21:34.461
Do you want to follow drunk
starlets like a peeping Tom?

21:34.463 --> 21:36.630
Or do you want to report? Huh?
That's probably better than this.

21:36.632 --> 21:38.465
Hey, I still got the "Sleaze
Team" for the rest of the year,

21:38.467 --> 21:39.800
I can do what I want
on the side.

21:39.802 --> 21:42.936
So take your assignment,
say, "Thanks, boss..."

21:42.938 --> 21:45.405
- Thanks, boss.
- ...and today, Jay. Today.

21:45.407 --> 21:46.840
Stupid me. There's probably
something in here

21:46.842 --> 21:48.375
about a two-headed baby.

21:48.377 --> 21:49.676
- Do you know what?
- No, no, no. There is.

21:49.678 --> 21:51.078
- I'm sure there is.
- Find meaning in it.

21:51.080 --> 21:52.579
- Find meaning in it. Okay?
- I just have a gut...

21:52.581 --> 21:53.647
- I feel good about this.
- That's your job.

21:53.649 --> 21:54.781
Yeah?
What?

21:54.783 --> 21:56.149
And you're right, you're right.

21:56.151 --> 21:57.417
You're right.
I'll make it right.

21:57.419 --> 21:58.652
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait wait, wait.

21:58.654 --> 22:00.087
- I'll make it right.
- By 6:00 p.m.

22:00.089 --> 22:01.722
Something fascinating, amazing,
Pulitzers all around!

22:01.724 --> 22:03.524
Pulitzers all around.
I'm gonna take this.

22:03.526 --> 22:05.292
Pulitzers all around!

22:05.294 --> 22:06.426
What?

22:12.401 --> 22:13.467
<i>Hello?</i>

22:13.469 --> 22:15.936
Hello.
Uh, Corinna Hodel?

22:15.938 --> 22:20.274
<i>Who's calling, please?</i>

22:20.276 --> 22:24.177
Mrs. Hodel, this is Fauna.
Fauna Hodel?

22:24.179 --> 22:25.412
Tamar's daughter.

22:25.414 --> 22:26.847
I-I-I called earlier.

22:26.849 --> 22:29.917
That's... Well, not quite right.

22:29.919 --> 22:31.285
Mrs. Hodel?

22:31.287 --> 22:33.320
<i>It's Huntington now.</i>

22:33.322 --> 22:34.922
<i>You called me before?</i>

22:34.924 --> 22:37.524
Yeah.
Two nights ago.

22:37.526 --> 22:40.327
<i>I'm afraid you're mistaken,
child.</i>

22:40.329 --> 22:43.730
<i>Or at least,</i>
<i>you never called</i> me.

22:43.732 --> 22:47.000
Well, I-I...
I need to talk to you.

22:47.002 --> 22:49.870
<i>What do you want?</i>

22:49.872 --> 22:53.240
Well, I was hoping that you
could help me to find Tamar.

22:53.242 --> 22:55.976
I need your help.
Please.

22:55.978 --> 23:01.081
<i>I'm very sorry to be
the one to tell you that...</i>

23:01.083 --> 23:03.617
<i>Tamar is deceased.</i>

23:03.619 --> 23:06.620
Dead?

23:06.622 --> 23:11.158
Um...

23:11.160 --> 23:14.595
Uh, Doc... Dr. Hodel, he...

23:14.597 --> 23:16.964
He didn't mention that.

23:16.966 --> 23:19.566
<i>I'm afraid I'm not feeling well.</i>

23:19.568 --> 23:22.102
Ma'am, I...
No, I need to talk to you.

23:22.104 --> 23:25.205
I came here from Nevada and...

23:25.207 --> 23:28.775
If... If she's dead, then, um...

23:33.782 --> 23:36.316
612 Alameda?
I'll be there today.

23:36.318 --> 23:38.785
<i>I...</i>

23:38.787 --> 23:42.723
<i>If... If you must come,
come alone.</i>

23:42.725 --> 23:44.625
<i>And don't ring the bell.</i>

23:44.627 --> 23:46.727
<i>Knock three times,
then three times more.</i>

23:46.729 --> 23:49.396
<i>I never answer the doorbell.</i>

24:08.217 --> 24:09.916
- Horace.
- Shit.

24:09.918 --> 24:11.518
Long time.
Let me buy a round.

24:11.520 --> 24:12.753
All right.

24:12.755 --> 24:13.987
What's it gonna be?

24:13.989 --> 24:16.523
Triple gin
with a splash of tonic.

24:16.525 --> 24:17.691
Comin' up.

24:17.693 --> 24:19.593
Man, I just wanted to see you.

24:19.595 --> 24:21.962
Now,
I thought you'd be suspicious,

24:21.964 --> 24:25.265
but you just ordered three gins.
That's fine.

24:25.267 --> 24:28.835
How much is three gins?
Like 5 bucks?

24:28.837 --> 24:31.772
You got it.

24:31.774 --> 24:34.675
Thank you.

24:34.677 --> 24:36.610
All right, so, uh,
I know you are

24:36.612 --> 24:37.944
the most reliable
jailhouse snitch

24:37.946 --> 24:39.813
in Los Angeles County,
which is saying something.

24:39.815 --> 24:41.481
Congratulations.
That's a big deal.

24:41.483 --> 24:43.550
Will you tell me
who Brody Stiles is?

24:43.552 --> 24:45.352
Brody Stiles?

24:45.354 --> 24:46.687
- Shit, man.
- Mm-hmm.

24:46.689 --> 24:49.089
Brody Stiles is a birdie.

24:49.091 --> 24:50.657
What do you mean?

24:50.659 --> 24:54.494
I mean he work with
LAPD all the time.

24:54.496 --> 24:57.597
He's a pigeon, man.

24:57.599 --> 25:01.501
He dummy up confessions
in court,

25:01.503 --> 25:03.937
"Yes, Your Honor,"

25:03.939 --> 25:06.840
he... he confessed to me
in his cell last night.

25:06.842 --> 25:08.208
"He did it."

25:08.210 --> 25:10.610
Ain't that some shit, man?

25:10.612 --> 25:15.749
Now they done got poor Brody
for killin' a white girl,

25:15.751 --> 25:19.086
and they fixin' to
send him up hard.

25:19.088 --> 25:20.520
You know him?

25:20.522 --> 25:24.257
Like a white woman gonna get in
the car with Brody Stiles.

25:24.259 --> 25:26.426
That Negro arthritis so bad,

25:26.428 --> 25:29.262
he can barely hold
his damn bottle.

25:29.264 --> 25:32.566
Yeah, I know Brody.

26:24.353 --> 26:27.954
Hello.
A-Are you...

26:27.956 --> 26:30.957
I'm Fauna.

26:30.959 --> 26:32.859
Come in.

26:42.051 --> 26:43.250
Do you like art?

26:43.252 --> 26:45.819
Yeah, it's wonderful.

26:45.821 --> 26:47.421
I'm a collector.

26:47.423 --> 26:51.292
I've collected here and abroad
all my life.

26:51.294 --> 26:53.594
Some of the works
are by my father.

26:53.596 --> 26:56.797
Tom Huntington?
The artist.

26:56.799 --> 26:59.533
He was quite the thing
before the war.

26:59.535 --> 27:02.436
Went mad in the end.

27:02.438 --> 27:04.772
Poor darling.

27:04.774 --> 27:06.140
Uh, I'm sorry.

27:06.142 --> 27:08.576
Th... They're real nice.

27:10.413 --> 27:14.281
I suppose I do see
the resemblance.

27:14.283 --> 27:17.151
I just hope you don't
have her nature.

27:17.153 --> 27:18.586
Yes, ma'am.

27:18.588 --> 27:23.057
What she did to this family,
it's a tragedy.

27:23.059 --> 27:25.192
Ma'am, what...

27:25.194 --> 27:27.995
When did she pass?

27:29.465 --> 27:32.266
I was about to have a lemonade.

27:32.268 --> 27:34.234
Would you like some?

27:34.236 --> 27:35.936
No, thank you, ma'am.

27:35.938 --> 27:37.171
I'll be just a moment.

27:37.173 --> 27:39.540
Please, have a seat.

27:43.913 --> 27:48.549
Did you know that one can
trace my family's history

27:48.551 --> 27:51.385
to the beginning of the
17th century in this country?

27:51.387 --> 27:53.587
Um, on my mother's side.

27:53.589 --> 27:56.824
They came over on the <i> Mayflower.</i>

27:56.826 --> 28:00.127
Mercy Makepeace.
How's that for a name?

28:01.464 --> 28:04.665
Your grandfather's family,
on the other hand,

28:04.667 --> 28:08.869
they came from
the Russian nobility.

28:08.871 --> 28:12.806
They hunted wild boar
with the Tsar.

28:12.808 --> 28:15.309
White Russians,
lucky to get out.

28:22.284 --> 28:24.885
Don't snoop.
It's rude.

28:24.887 --> 28:26.320
I-I'm sorry.

28:26.322 --> 28:29.056
Never mind.
Let's sit.

28:45.708 --> 28:51.412
M-Ma'am, can you please show me
any pictures of Tamar?

28:51.414 --> 28:54.214
Or can you at least
tell me about her?

28:54.216 --> 28:58.886
You must understand,
Tamar was not my daughter.

29:01.457 --> 29:04.591
She was nearly 6
when I met her father.

29:04.593 --> 29:08.495
I used to call her "Apate"...

29:08.497 --> 29:12.599
The goddess of deceit.

29:12.601 --> 29:17.971
She was so caught up in
her fantasy worlds and lies.

29:17.973 --> 29:21.542
A doctor called her
a "pathological liar."

29:21.544 --> 29:27.514
It was as if she couldn't tell
if she were awake or dreaming.

29:27.516 --> 29:31.785
She'd ask,
"Mummy, am I dreaming?"

29:31.787 --> 29:35.789
Her father... well,
she ruined his reputation.

29:35.791 --> 29:38.525
And she destroyed our family.

29:38.527 --> 29:42.496
Her lies ran out of control

29:42.498 --> 29:46.100
and out into the wide world.

29:46.102 --> 29:52.439
Ma'am, can... can you tell me
what she lied about?

29:52.441 --> 29:55.142
Enough sad stories.

29:55.144 --> 29:59.980
I am going to show you something
wonderful about your family.

30:02.885 --> 30:05.018
"Bloody Romeo."

30:05.020 --> 30:07.254
You newspaper guys
are clever, eh?

30:07.256 --> 30:08.589
- It's a stupid name.
- Yeah.

30:08.591 --> 30:11.125
They lose a couple hookers
up there every month.

30:11.127 --> 30:13.627
They interviewed one
working girl that knew her.

30:13.629 --> 30:15.362
Uh, Wendy Sadowski?

30:15.364 --> 30:16.764
Something like that.
I can find it.

30:16.766 --> 30:18.699
Why are you looking
at this shit?

30:18.701 --> 30:20.701
Who cares? They got a guy.
He confessed.

30:20.703 --> 30:22.269
So Bro... So Brody Stiles,

30:22.271 --> 30:24.838
you make him for
the Bloody Romeo himself?

30:24.840 --> 30:27.608
Look, blame whoever came up with
"Bloody Romeo."

30:27.610 --> 30:30.043
A name like that,
they got to find somebody.

30:30.045 --> 30:30.978
Yeah.

30:30.980 --> 30:32.546
- More coffee?
- Yes, please.

30:32.548 --> 30:34.214
So what's gonna happen
to poor old Brody?

30:34.216 --> 30:37.050
What's gonna happen?
He signed a confession.

30:37.052 --> 30:39.887
They drop cyanide in sulfuric
acid and make him breathe it.

30:39.889 --> 30:41.755
- That's what happens.
- Fantastic.

30:41.757 --> 30:43.590
And if he ain't the right guy,
then...

30:43.592 --> 30:46.160
Jay, he's always the guy.

30:52.735 --> 30:55.068
Sometimes, in the car,
I think I'm back at Yudam-ni

30:55.070 --> 30:58.338
when the 155's started popping.

30:58.340 --> 31:00.240
Mm.

31:00.242 --> 31:02.509
I thought I was gonna
save the world from Nazis.

31:02.511 --> 31:06.046
Then I got shot to shit
by Chinks.

31:07.817 --> 31:13.387
I thought the truth would win,

31:13.389 --> 31:16.590
like a sucker.

31:16.592 --> 31:20.594
Joined God's own Marine Corps
like a genius.

31:22.698 --> 31:24.464
Okay, I got a question for you.

31:24.466 --> 31:25.833
Shoot.

31:25.835 --> 31:28.235
Say you've got a case
that's 10, 15 years old.

31:28.237 --> 31:30.103
Say it's about
an illegal abortion clinic,

31:30.105 --> 31:32.539
the daughter of the suspect
knew everything about it,

31:32.541 --> 31:34.641
but now she's vanished
into thin air.

31:34.643 --> 31:36.376
Is the wife still with him?

31:36.378 --> 31:37.878
No. Divorced.

31:37.880 --> 31:41.381
Bingo. If I was working it,
that's where I'd go.

31:41.383 --> 31:42.482
Mm.

31:42.484 --> 31:44.551
<i>Cherchez la femme.</i>

32:05.674 --> 32:07.674
This is crazy.

32:28.864 --> 32:31.064
No, she's too young to be Tamar.

32:33.502 --> 32:35.969
Who the hell is she?

32:35.971 --> 32:37.037
Shit.

33:14.176 --> 33:16.944
Uh, can you tell me something
about my family?

33:16.946 --> 33:19.313
What about Dr. Hodel?

33:19.315 --> 33:22.683
Why would he invite me here
if he wasn't gonna be here?

33:22.685 --> 33:25.986
Your grandfather...

33:25.988 --> 33:28.855
I want you to
understand something.

33:28.857 --> 33:31.925
He's a very,
very important person.

33:31.927 --> 33:35.128
One of the greatest minds
of the century.

33:35.130 --> 33:39.933
He was measured to have an IQ of
187 when he was your age.

33:39.935 --> 33:42.936
A child prodigy on the piano,

33:42.938 --> 33:46.273
instructed by Rachmaninoff
himself, no less.

34:30.819 --> 34:32.185
Detective Ohls, please.

34:32.187 --> 34:33.754
<i>- Yeah, this is Ohls.</i>
- Oh, hey man.

34:33.755 --> 34:35.422
You ever get that address
for those working girls

34:35.424 --> 34:37.491
that knew Janice Brewster?
A Wendy, uh...

34:37.493 --> 34:38.658
<i>Yeah, yeah. I got it.</i>

34:38.659 --> 34:40.761
<i>- Uh, Wendy Sadowski.</i>
- Yep.

34:40.763 --> 34:43.964
<i>Last known address is a squat
up near Sunset and Vine.</i>

34:43.966 --> 34:47.400
- Uh-huh.
<i>- 1125 Beechwood.</i>

34:47.402 --> 34:48.835
<i>Wear rubber boots.</i>

34:48.837 --> 34:50.404
Thank you.

34:50.406 --> 34:53.373
<i>Hey, hey, did you have any luck
with that other thing?</i>

34:53.375 --> 34:55.342
<i>That old case?</i>

34:55.344 --> 34:58.211
Uh, no.

34:58.213 --> 35:00.981
No.
Just chasing ghosts.

35:00.983 --> 35:03.183
Uh, all right, man.
I got to go.

35:03.185 --> 35:05.530
I got to file by 6:00.
Take care of yourself.

35:05.554 --> 35:06.920
Yep.

35:06.922 --> 35:08.288
See you later.

35:14.001 --> 35:17.436
George was, um, in charge of...

35:17.438 --> 35:21.340
Napkin in your lap, dear.

35:21.342 --> 35:24.076
George was in charge of

35:24.078 --> 35:26.211
the L.A. County
Health Department.

35:26.213 --> 35:30.549
He specialized in
sexually transmitted diseases.

35:30.551 --> 35:33.151
And he worked extensively
for the UN

35:33.153 --> 35:35.354
in China and the Philippines.

35:35.356 --> 35:40.926
No, use the smaller fork.

35:40.928 --> 35:42.461
Outside in.

35:42.463 --> 35:47.599
Start on the outside
and work in.

35:47.601 --> 35:48.767
And sit up straight.

35:48.769 --> 35:51.249
What if you were dining
with the Queen?

35:55.442 --> 35:57.976
Ma'am, I-I...
I would like to meet him.

35:57.978 --> 36:01.380
He told me
to come to L.A.

36:01.382 --> 36:04.850
Yes, well, he's very, very busy,
remember?

36:08.322 --> 36:12.791
But we are going to do
the next best thing...

36:12.793 --> 36:16.128
I will show you part of his
collection that is housed here.

36:16.130 --> 36:21.667
This is art he loves,
he influenced.

36:21.669 --> 36:29.141
"Art... before all else, art is
mankind's noblest endeavor."

36:29.143 --> 36:34.112
When we've shuffled off
this mortal coil,

36:34.114 --> 36:38.083
art is all that remains.

36:43.524 --> 36:47.326
Surrealism... what do you know
about surrealism?

36:47.328 --> 36:54.666
George wants to free us
from false rationality.

36:54.668 --> 36:58.870
What is dreamt
is often more real

36:58.872 --> 37:01.573
than what we think of as real.

37:01.575 --> 37:06.278
In fact, the waking state
can be considered

37:06.280 --> 37:10.082
a phenomenon of interference.

37:11.352 --> 37:14.152
Um, I'm going to show you
George's collection.

37:14.154 --> 37:17.456
Please, do wait here.

37:17.458 --> 37:20.092
I'll be back momentarily.

37:32.306 --> 37:34.873
Fauna.

37:37.945 --> 37:41.313
...convulsive beauty,
the strongest of all,

37:41.315 --> 37:45.350
is veiled eroticism,
explosive magic,

37:45.352 --> 37:48.120
or it simply won't be beauty.

37:48.122 --> 37:50.389
Under the pretense of
civilization,

37:50.391 --> 37:52.257
we have managed to banish
with the mind

37:52.259 --> 37:56.294
everything that might rightly or
wrongly be termed superstition,

37:56.296 --> 37:59.231
forbidding any kind of research
into truth.

37:59.233 --> 38:00.799
What about de Sade?

38:00.801 --> 38:04.636
Certainly the argument can be
made that de Sade was satire.

38:04.638 --> 38:06.905
"Literature is one of
the saddest roads

38:06.907 --> 38:08.974
that leads to everything."

38:08.976 --> 38:13.345
Your celebration of error
is in my opinion dangerous.

38:13.347 --> 38:17.149
My old friend, remove
the bourgeois reckonings.

38:17.151 --> 38:20.852
Your limited definitions
of hallucination and perversion

38:20.854 --> 38:24.623
over these boring,
contradictory ideas.

38:28.295 --> 38:30.529
10 bucks to talk to Wendy,
right?

38:30.531 --> 38:32.297
$10 for me, $10 for her.

38:32.299 --> 38:34.800
Well, that's exorbitant.

38:34.802 --> 38:37.069
Sadowski.
Wendy Sadowski, right?

38:37.071 --> 38:39.304
Yeah, some Polack name.
That's it.

38:39.306 --> 38:41.973
What happened to your face?

38:41.975 --> 38:43.842
Everything.

38:56.724 --> 38:58.190
Sit tight.

38:59.259 --> 39:01.193
Wendy?

39:01.195 --> 39:02.561
What do you want, bitch?

39:02.563 --> 39:04.329
You got a customer, jackass.

39:04.331 --> 39:07.299
Oh, man, far out.

39:09.036 --> 39:11.570
Hey, man.
You want to party?

39:11.572 --> 39:13.638
No, I don't want to party.
And I'm not a cop.

39:13.640 --> 39:16.608
I just want to talk about
your friend Janice Brewster.

39:16.610 --> 39:17.609
You vice?

39:17.611 --> 39:19.211
What am I, an idiot?

39:19.213 --> 39:21.346
Besides, he just wants to talk.

39:21.348 --> 39:22.380
I'm not vice.

39:22.382 --> 39:24.516
I barely brush my teeth.

39:24.518 --> 39:26.451
You paid, right?
Yeah.

39:26.453 --> 39:29.354
Of course he did.
What do I look like?

39:29.356 --> 39:31.723
Shit, shit.

39:34.061 --> 39:36.228
- Janny?
- Mm.

39:36.230 --> 39:38.530
What about Janny, man?
Janny's dead.

39:38.532 --> 39:39.765
Yeah, no, I know that,
sweetheart.

39:39.767 --> 39:41.433
You ever see her
hang out with a guy,

39:41.435 --> 39:42.934
black guy, named Brody Stiles?

39:42.936 --> 39:44.436
I've got a picture.

39:44.438 --> 39:46.872
Janice wouldn't touch
nothin' colored.

39:46.874 --> 39:48.173
She was prejudiced.

39:48.175 --> 39:49.574
Just take a look at the picture.

39:49.576 --> 39:53.645
I'm telling you, man,
Janice ain't about that thing.

39:53.647 --> 39:56.047
No Brody Stiles?
No this guy?

39:56.049 --> 39:58.784
- You haven't seen this guy?
- I have no idea who that is.

39:58.786 --> 40:00.952
This guy?

40:00.954 --> 40:02.721
It's just so sad

40:02.723 --> 40:05.924
'cause Janny was in
such a good mood lately.

40:07.928 --> 40:09.294
Oh, shit.

40:09.296 --> 40:10.962
Shit! Lock the door!

40:14.401 --> 40:15.801
What's that?

40:15.803 --> 40:17.068
Is that the fuzz?

40:17.070 --> 40:18.870
Shit no it ain't!
Quiet!

40:18.872 --> 40:21.439
I told Jimmy he didn't have the
muscle to hold this place down.

40:22.943 --> 40:25.710
Open up bitches!
Or I'll cut your stupid throats!

40:25.712 --> 40:27.813
Open up the goddamn door!

40:27.815 --> 40:30.182
Maybe I should just see
who that is.

40:30.184 --> 40:31.683
Don't you open that door, man.

40:31.685 --> 40:34.052
- Don't you do it.
- You better come see us!

40:34.054 --> 40:35.353
Or he's gonna get it!

40:35.355 --> 40:37.122
Open the goddamn door!

40:37.124 --> 40:38.824
Sh...

40:38.826 --> 40:41.493
This is Jo-Jo's turf,
you stupid bitches!

40:43.497 --> 40:46.164
Screw you!

40:48.769 --> 40:51.736
Wendy, you said Janice was
in a good mood lately. Why?

40:51.738 --> 40:54.072
I don't know.

40:54.074 --> 40:57.242
I don't know nothin'.

40:57.244 --> 40:59.711
She met somebody is all.

40:59.713 --> 41:02.414
She didn't tell me
or Jimmy nothin' about it.

41:02.416 --> 41:08.386
She said he was nice.
And smart.

41:08.388 --> 41:10.822
That's all.
I swear to God.

41:10.824 --> 41:13.224
She didn't tell me
anything else.

41:15.529 --> 41:18.496
Thank you, sweetheart.

41:18.498 --> 41:21.299
Oh, you're leaving?
Don't you want to party?

41:21.301 --> 41:23.134
No, I want a doughnut.

41:23.136 --> 41:28.974
I think I...
I got something you want.

41:28.976 --> 41:31.142
Yeah.

41:31.144 --> 41:33.044
I'm good.

41:33.046 --> 41:36.748
Aw!

41:38.886 --> 41:42.454
Nothing ever works out for me.

41:42.456 --> 41:46.858
I never made a good decision
and...

41:46.860 --> 41:49.828
today I knew
from the minute I woke up,

41:49.830 --> 41:54.266
today was gonna be a bad day...

41:57.304 --> 42:01.907
...a bad-luck,
shit day.

42:05.245 --> 42:07.412
What do you mean?

42:07.414 --> 42:10.949
It's my baby's birthday.

42:12.419 --> 42:13.485
What?

42:13.487 --> 42:16.655
It's my baby's birthday.

42:16.657 --> 42:21.660
I never even saw him,
since the day he was born.

42:21.662 --> 42:26.464
They... took him
out of my arms.

42:29.670 --> 42:32.370
What did you mean they...
They took him from you?

42:32.372 --> 42:36.074
Why? Who?
Who?

42:36.076 --> 42:38.209
The sisters in the convent.

42:38.211 --> 42:41.713
That's where you go
when you've been a bad girl.

42:41.715 --> 42:47.118
They hide you till the baby's
born, and then <i> whoosh.</i>

42:47.120 --> 42:51.089
You never see 'em again.

43:05.172 --> 43:07.272
A convent...

43:10.510 --> 43:14.512
If Tamar...

43:14.514 --> 43:16.548
49, 50...

43:22.622 --> 43:25.523
Oh, shit. Shit.

43:25.525 --> 43:26.891
Oh, shit, shit, shit.

44:08.883 --> 44:11.049
Why do I revere de Sade?

44:11.051 --> 44:13.519
He was free.

44:13.521 --> 44:18.657
He maintained control
over his own destiny,

44:18.659 --> 44:21.460
his own sovereignty
no matter the cost.

44:21.462 --> 44:24.897
When you live as I do...
True to oneself,

44:24.899 --> 44:27.566
unencumbered by
the burden of convention...

44:27.568 --> 44:29.268
That's real freedom,

44:29.270 --> 44:32.304
and that is the heartbeat
of all art.

44:32.306 --> 44:36.275
But first you must open
your eyes and see the chains.

44:36.277 --> 44:42.080
Your dreams are more real,
more true, than your reality,

44:42.082 --> 44:43.448
but you must remove the veil

44:43.450 --> 44:46.418
society puts over all of us
after childhood.

44:46.420 --> 44:48.821
Truth is in your veins...

44:48.823 --> 44:53.058
What you feel
and what you desire.

45:07.174 --> 45:09.408
Do you have a favorite?

45:51.218 --> 45:53.919
Oh, there you are.

45:59.293 --> 46:01.827
It's getting late.
We should go.

46:50.177 --> 46:51.710
Excuse me, sir?

46:51.712 --> 46:54.246
You can't drive like that
in this area.

47:05.626 --> 47:07.993
I'm going to drop you here,

47:07.995 --> 47:11.463
and you can catch a bus
downtown, or to wherever.

47:11.465 --> 47:12.731
Yes, ma'am.

47:12.733 --> 47:14.733
I hope you understand,

47:14.735 --> 47:17.703
it won't be safe
for me to drive you home.

47:17.705 --> 47:20.572
Of course, it isn't the place
for you either.

47:20.574 --> 47:22.941
That's the way it is.

47:22.943 --> 47:26.178
With all due respect,
Mrs. Hodel,

47:26.180 --> 47:29.081
it is the place for me.
I'm mixed-race after all,

47:29.083 --> 47:31.216
even though
you may not like that.

47:34.088 --> 47:38.924
You're not black,
you boring girl.

47:41.195 --> 47:42.327
What?

47:42.329 --> 47:44.062
You're not mixed-race, ninny.

47:44.064 --> 47:47.099
Tamar was always a liar,
I told you.

47:47.101 --> 47:50.202
She did prefer the Negroes
to her own kind,

47:50.204 --> 47:53.739
and of course she hated us,
her real family.

47:53.741 --> 47:56.775
Well, who's my father?

47:56.777 --> 47:59.945
He was a French ballet dancer.

47:59.947 --> 48:02.414
Very famous on the Continent.

48:02.416 --> 48:04.016
Beautiful.

48:04.018 --> 48:04.950
A genius, really.

48:04.952 --> 48:07.352
He was visiting that summer.

48:07.354 --> 48:11.056
You're a liar.

48:13.994 --> 48:16.328
You're a liar.

48:16.330 --> 48:18.130
Racist old cow.

48:18.132 --> 48:20.699
You can't lie
on a birth certificate.

48:20.701 --> 48:22.934
That's a legal document!

48:22.936 --> 48:24.736
Stupid...
