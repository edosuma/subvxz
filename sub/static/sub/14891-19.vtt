01:23.183 --> 01:25.485
Cousin, cousin, cousin.

01:25.519 --> 01:28.188
I’ve got some amazing news.
You’d better sit down.

01:31.558 --> 01:32.659
I am sitting.

01:32.693 --> 01:34.094
Well, then stand up.

01:36.697 --> 01:37.831
Alright, now sit down.

01:39.766 --> 01:42.268
I have been waiting
and waiting to find

01:42.302 --> 01:43.704
just the right time to tell you.

01:43.737 --> 01:46.406
Do you know how Ms. Lydia
is always wanting

01:46.439 --> 01:48.875
exciting new scripts
for her theater group?

01:48.909 --> 01:53.213
Mm‐hmm. Oh, don’t tell me
you gave Lydia my play!

01:53.246 --> 01:55.582
Okay, I won’t tell you, but
then I won’t have any news.

01:58.685 --> 02:01.487
You wanna make popcorn or...

02:01.522 --> 02:04.490
Balki, I can’t believe
you gave her my script

02:04.525 --> 02:05.892
without my permission.

02:05.926 --> 02:08.929
My play, "Wheat," is still
a work in progress.

02:08.961 --> 02:11.765
Oh, I’ll be humiliated!

02:11.798 --> 02:14.367
The theater group will hate it!

02:14.400 --> 02:16.537
I‐I’ll be a laughing stock!

02:17.838 --> 02:20.707
Cousin, um, it opens on Friday.

02:20.741 --> 02:21.875
They’ve been rehearsing
for weeks.

02:22.809 --> 02:24.277
Everyone loves it!

02:24.310 --> 02:25.512
Well, of course they love it.

02:25.546 --> 02:26.547
It’s a brilliant
piece of writing.

02:28.414 --> 02:29.883
Well, cousin,
I’ve never actually read it

02:29.916 --> 02:32.686
but as the author you’ll be
particularly pleased to know

02:32.719 --> 02:35.756
that the stage is brilliantly
managed by me.

02:35.789 --> 02:36.857
I’m the stage manager!

02:38.625 --> 02:40.160
They forgot my name!

02:41.795 --> 02:45.766
My‐my duties include opening
and closing the curtain.

02:45.799 --> 02:47.333
I’ve been practicing
in the shower all week.

02:49.536 --> 02:52.405
[upbeat music]

02:56.577 --> 02:57.844
Cousin, cousin, come on.

02:57.878 --> 02:58.979
I’m gonna give you...

02:59.012 --> 03:01.782
I’m gonna give you a complete
tour of the theater.

03:01.815 --> 03:05.285
Now this...is the stage.

03:07.688 --> 03:12.893
And, and these,
these are the chairs.

03:14.795 --> 03:17.964
And that’s...just about it.

03:20.801 --> 03:24.571
Oh, hi, Larry!
I love your play!

03:24.605 --> 03:25.972
I bet you were really excited

03:26.006 --> 03:27.473
when Balki told
you we’re doing it?

03:27.508 --> 03:28.609
I sure was.

03:28.642 --> 03:31.578
You know, the play is, uh,
somewhat autobiographical.

03:31.612 --> 03:34.447
I based the character
of Lawrence on, well...me.

03:36.550 --> 03:39.485
Well, despite that opening
night’s already sold out!

03:45.391 --> 03:47.794
Cousin! Cousin, cousin, look!
Look! See them two guys?

03:47.828 --> 03:51.732
The guy on the left, he’s
the director, Trevor McNeil.

03:51.765 --> 03:53.767
’And the guy on the right
is the star of the show’

03:53.800 --> 03:55.936
Brad Oliver.
You’ve seen him before!

03:55.969 --> 03:57.538
‐I have?
‐Yes!

03:57.571 --> 03:59.640
Last week
at Little Tony’s Pasta Palace.

04:00.774 --> 04:02.442
He was our waiter.

04:04.410 --> 04:06.279
Okay, in this scene
your brother, Billy

04:06.312 --> 04:08.281
erupts in a fit of anger.

04:08.314 --> 04:09.683
Now, Brad,
your character of Lawrence

04:09.716 --> 04:12.653
is‐is basically a buffoon.

04:12.686 --> 04:14.354
So your underlying
motivation is...

04:15.488 --> 04:17.690
Bu...buffoonery?

04:20.060 --> 04:22.395
Bravo, Brad! Yeah!

04:22.428 --> 04:24.731
Thanks, Trevor, I’m depending
on your guidance to help make

04:24.765 --> 04:26.867
this Lawrence character
a complete bonehead.

04:29.002 --> 04:31.371
Good, good. And look, don’t let
the words get in your way.

04:31.404 --> 04:33.540
We can always change
them later, huh?

04:33.574 --> 04:35.909
Ho...ho...whoa,
whoa, no!

04:35.942 --> 04:38.044
No, no, no, no, you‐you
can’t change the words.

04:38.078 --> 04:39.913
The words are sacred.

04:39.946 --> 04:41.447
‐Who are you?
‐I’m Larry Appleton.

04:41.481 --> 04:43.550
The author of "Wheat."

04:43.584 --> 04:45.586
And "Wheat" is perfect
as it is.

04:45.619 --> 04:47.821
Every word is in its
proper place.

04:47.854 --> 04:51.457
Oh, I see what’s going on here.

04:51.491 --> 04:52.859
This is your first play

04:52.893 --> 04:55.095
and you think you’ve
written a masterpiece.

04:55.128 --> 04:57.898
Well, I’ll tell you what, if you
work real hard, maybe someday

04:57.931 --> 04:59.566
you’ll have a career writing
game show questions, huh?

05:00.801 --> 05:03.103
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Just a minute.

05:03.136 --> 05:06.807
Cousin Larry happens
to be a published writer.

05:06.840 --> 05:08.942
He fills in the bubbles
for the cartoon

05:08.975 --> 05:09.976
"Dimitri’s World."

05:12.078 --> 05:14.848
Ooh, that’s very impressive.

05:14.881 --> 05:16.983
Now be a good little playwright
and get off my stage.

05:18.685 --> 05:21.021
You, sir, are theatrically
illiterate!

05:21.054 --> 05:22.656
I‐I‐I bet you thought
that "The King And I"

05:22.689 --> 05:24.625
was the story
of Elvis and Priscilla!

05:27.060 --> 05:28.629
You mean it’s not?

05:30.697 --> 05:32.699
I don’t need this aggravation,
huh?

05:32.733 --> 05:34.901
I don’t need this play! I quit!

05:40.941 --> 05:43.476
Well, good! Who needs him?

05:43.510 --> 05:45.045
I do! He’s my ride!

05:45.779 --> 05:46.847
I quit!

05:51.885 --> 05:54.354
Well, well, you still want to
put on this play, don’t you?

06:03.029 --> 06:05.932
Boy, I’m guessing
Trevor has a van.

06:09.035 --> 06:11.705
Larry, I just ran into
Trevor in the hall!

06:11.738 --> 06:13.907
I cannot believe that
you made him quit!

06:13.940 --> 06:15.441
Well, then, so, you’ll get
another director.

06:15.475 --> 06:16.677
And then some more actors.

06:16.710 --> 06:18.912
You can open in a couple months.

06:18.945 --> 06:20.847
You know, that‐that would
really help me out a lot.

06:20.881 --> 06:23.750
It‐it would give me time
to perfect my curtain‐closing.

06:25.719 --> 06:27.954
Every time I practice
in the shower, someone’s in it

06:27.988 --> 06:29.656
and they scream
and ruin my timing.

06:31.992 --> 06:35.461
Well, I suppose we could
postpone, but I‐I don’t know

06:35.495 --> 06:38.464
if Clive Rich will be available
in two months.

06:38.498 --> 06:39.833
Clive Ric... Cli...
Clive Rich?

06:39.866 --> 06:41.802
The Clive Rich was going
to review my play?

06:41.835 --> 06:43.770
He was going to be here
on opening night

06:43.804 --> 06:46.740
but now I’ll just have to call
him and tell him it’s off.

06:46.773 --> 06:48.809
No, wait, Lydia!
Don’t‐don’t call anyone.

06:48.842 --> 06:50.811
You‐you know the old show
business saying?

06:50.844 --> 06:52.913
Feed a cold, starve an actor?

06:54.581 --> 06:56.983
No, it’s, "The show must go on."

06:57.017 --> 06:57.984
And it will.

06:58.018 --> 07:00.220
I will be the director
and I, Larry Appleton

07:00.253 --> 07:02.556
will star in "Wheat."

07:06.760 --> 07:08.929
[upbeat music]

07:11.565 --> 07:13.534
Alright! Alright, everybody!

07:13.567 --> 07:17.037
People! People! Gather around!
Here we go. Okay.

07:17.070 --> 07:19.840
I know it’s only a few
days until we open

07:19.873 --> 07:22.576
but I’ve been up all
night rewriting "Wheat."

07:22.609 --> 07:24.210
So that the five of us
can handle it, alright?

07:24.244 --> 07:28.014
Now, I will play Lawrence,
the lead role and narrator.

07:28.048 --> 07:31.552
Balki, you will be
my brother, Billy.

07:31.585 --> 07:33.654
Jennifer...Lois.

07:33.687 --> 07:36.022
Mary Anne...Bobbi Sue.

07:36.056 --> 07:38.458
And Lydia...the Apple Lady.

07:41.928 --> 07:43.830
Larry, we have never acted.

07:43.864 --> 07:46.132
We’re gonna make
fools of ourselves.

07:46.166 --> 07:47.934
The only thing I ever acted
in was the sixth grade

07:47.968 --> 07:49.202
hygiene pageant.

07:51.638 --> 07:52.773
I played Little Miss Gingivitis.

07:56.042 --> 07:58.745
There is nothing to worry about.
I will guide you through.

07:58.779 --> 08:01.748
I know everything there
is to know about the theater.

08:01.782 --> 08:03.984
In college,
I was the head ticket taker.

08:06.019 --> 08:07.888
So that’s why
they called you Stubby.

08:12.292 --> 08:15.161
Larry, I just read the
description of Lois.

08:17.598 --> 08:20.300
And when we get through this,
we’re going to have a nice

08:20.333 --> 08:23.637
long discussion about
why you think your wife

08:23.670 --> 08:25.005
should play your mother.

08:28.008 --> 08:29.275
What about...
W‐w‐we’ll talk about it later.

08:29.309 --> 08:31.678
Why don’t you go
with Lydia and Mary Anne

08:31.712 --> 08:33.580
learn the lines
for the wheatfield scene

08:33.614 --> 08:36.549
and Balki and I will start
rehearsal on stage.

08:36.582 --> 08:37.984
At least in this play
I won’t be washed off

08:38.018 --> 08:39.785
the stage by a giant Waterpik.

08:43.724 --> 08:46.860
Cousin, um,
I have two small problems.

08:46.893 --> 08:49.062
I’ll give you the big one first.

08:49.095 --> 08:52.132
If I play your brother, Billy

08:52.165 --> 08:54.300
how am I gonna still
be able to pull the curtain?

08:54.334 --> 08:56.202
I’ve got a lot of time
invested in that.

08:58.038 --> 08:59.239
You can still pull the curtain.

08:59.272 --> 09:00.641
‐Really? Okay.
‐Yes.

09:00.674 --> 09:01.875
Now, what’s your
second problem?

09:01.908 --> 09:03.744
I don’t think I can play
your brother, Billy.

09:04.277 --> 09:05.646
Why not?

09:05.679 --> 09:07.047
Well, because Billy
in the script

09:07.080 --> 09:08.982
is a mean, angry person

09:09.015 --> 09:11.818
and I don’t think I can
be someone mean and angry.

09:11.852 --> 09:13.854
It’s too different
from what I am.

09:13.887 --> 09:15.321
So, um, I was thinking

09:15.355 --> 09:20.260
maybe if Billy
was an immigrant mail boy

09:20.293 --> 09:22.162
who now draws a cartoon...

09:24.197 --> 09:27.067
‐I think I could get that.
‐Okay.

09:27.100 --> 09:30.971
Balki, you don’t have
to be a mean person

09:31.004 --> 09:34.274
to act a mean character
in a play.

09:34.307 --> 09:36.042
See, you just, you just
have to think of a mean person

09:36.076 --> 09:37.243
and then you become that person.

09:37.277 --> 09:40.246
You think of a mean person,
and you become that person.

09:40.280 --> 09:43.684
So just, just think of somebody
who is really mean.

09:47.387 --> 09:50.023
I don’t know anyone really mean.

09:50.056 --> 09:51.692
Sure you do.
Uh, uh, wait, oh, wait.

09:51.725 --> 09:52.759
You were always telling
me back on Mypos

09:52.793 --> 09:53.927
there‐there was a bully.

09:53.960 --> 09:55.195
He used to always
steal your lunch

09:55.228 --> 09:57.698
when you were going over Goat
Water Bridge to get to school?

09:57.731 --> 09:59.099
Uh, Brunos.

09:59.132 --> 10:00.366
I can’t talk about that, cousin.

10:00.400 --> 10:03.369
‐I‐I‐I‐I still get nightmares.
‐No, it’s alright, alright.

10:03.403 --> 10:05.005
You, you, you don’t
have to think about

10:05.038 --> 10:06.840
what he did to you.

10:06.873 --> 10:10.343
Just‐just think about
who he was.

10:10.376 --> 10:13.146
Just‐just describe him. Hmm?

10:13.179 --> 10:14.881
Well...

10:16.683 --> 10:19.953
‐He was as big as an ox.
‐Mm‐hmm.

10:22.122 --> 10:24.257
‐He was as strong as an ox.
‐Mm‐hmm.

10:26.893 --> 10:29.796
‐He smelled like an ox.
‐Mm‐hmm.

10:32.966 --> 10:34.400
W‐wait a minute.

10:34.434 --> 10:37.237
He was an Ox. I’m thinking
of the family Ox, Mikey.

10:42.142 --> 10:44.911
Brunos. Think of Brunos.
Think of Brunos.

10:47.881 --> 10:50.817
Oh! Yeah.

10:50.851 --> 10:52.418
‐I got him. I got him.
‐Okay, alright, alright.

10:52.452 --> 10:53.820
Alright. Just‐just describe him.

10:53.854 --> 10:55.989
What‐what‐what
did he sound like?

10:56.022 --> 10:59.726
When he talked,
it was like thunder.

10:59.760 --> 11:01.227
Mm‐hmm, okay, okay.
How did he move?

11:04.030 --> 11:07.067
When he walked,
the whole island shook.

11:09.269 --> 11:11.204
He wasn’t invited out
very often.

11:11.237 --> 11:13.206
He wasn’t invited out
very often?

11:13.239 --> 11:14.775
‐No.
‐Why not?

11:14.808 --> 11:17.377
Because he was big
and smelly and scary.

11:19.479 --> 11:21.414
And have you ever thought
how that made him feel?

11:24.818 --> 11:27.353
‐Angry!
‐Mm‐hmm.

11:27.387 --> 11:29.122
‐Angry!
‐Alright. Good! Good!

11:29.155 --> 11:31.925
‐Become Brunos!
‐Ah!

11:34.895 --> 11:36.963
It’s Friday night
and I’m all alone.

11:37.898 --> 11:40.934
And I smell bad!

11:40.967 --> 11:43.003
Great! Great!
You’re doing great!

11:43.036 --> 11:45.171
You’re doing great! Oh!

11:45.205 --> 11:46.907
Alright, alright. Now, come on,
let’s just, let’s just

11:46.940 --> 11:49.042
try it with the lines, okay?

11:49.075 --> 11:50.143
‐Okay.
‐Alright, alright. Here we go.

11:50.176 --> 11:51.277
‐Yeah. Okay.
‐Here we go. Alright.

11:51.311 --> 11:53.479
‐Angry, angry.
‐Angry!

11:53.514 --> 11:54.681
‐Good! Okay, okay. Alright.
‐Yeah.

11:54.715 --> 12:00.453
"Billy, who parked the thresher
down by Old Creek Road?"

12:00.486 --> 12:04.024
"I did. What are you
going to do about it?"

12:09.495 --> 12:12.498
No, no, no.
You lost the anger.

12:12.533 --> 12:14.434
You lost the anger. It all
went right out the window.

12:14.467 --> 12:17.370
Alright, what you have to do...

12:17.403 --> 12:20.941
You have to retain the anger
when you say the lines.

12:20.974 --> 12:23.343
Alright, alright,
what we need is a word...

12:23.376 --> 12:25.812
...that will help you
to become Brunos.

12:25.846 --> 12:28.949
A key word that will set off
your memory of Brunos

12:28.982 --> 12:30.250
when he was at his meanest.

12:30.283 --> 12:32.819
Alright, alright.
Where would you see Brunos?

12:32.853 --> 12:35.789
Uh...well, uh, when I
was on my way to school.

12:35.822 --> 12:37.190
And you’d be on your
way to school.

12:37.223 --> 12:38.525
‐Yeah, I‐I‐I‐I would have‐‐
‐You’d have your lunch.

12:38.559 --> 12:41.394
I’d have my lunch, and‐and I’d
be crossing over the‐the bridge.

12:41.427 --> 12:43.163
Path to school. Okay, alright.

12:43.196 --> 12:47.000
[snaps fingers]
I’ve got it. Lunch.

12:47.033 --> 12:48.468
Bridge.

12:48.502 --> 12:51.938
Alright... Uh, uh, school.

12:51.972 --> 12:53.173
Bridge.

12:55.008 --> 12:56.943
Alright, alright. Path.

12:56.977 --> 12:58.244
Bridge!

12:58.278 --> 13:01.147
Bridge! Bridge!

13:01.181 --> 13:03.183
I’ve got it. Bridge!

13:03.216 --> 13:05.886
[screaming]

13:05.919 --> 13:07.487
Great! Great!
You’re doing great!

13:07.521 --> 13:09.556
Yes! Yes! Yes!
Alright! Alright!

13:09.590 --> 13:13.126
Every time you hear that word
you will become Brunos!

13:13.159 --> 13:15.061
Now, we can put that word
anywhere in the script!

13:15.095 --> 13:16.530
Alright, come on.
Let’s try it with the lines.

13:16.563 --> 13:17.731
‐Okay.
‐Here we go. Here we go.

13:17.764 --> 13:19.533
Come on, come on. One more time.
Here we go. Alright, ready?

13:19.566 --> 13:20.801
‐Yeah. Okay.
‐Alright, here we go.

13:20.834 --> 13:27.941
"Billy, who parked the thresher
down by Old Creek...Bridge?"

13:27.974 --> 13:31.311
"I did! What are you
gonna do about it?"

13:33.413 --> 13:35.148
[instrumental music]

13:41.487 --> 13:43.056
[instrumental music]

13:55.936 --> 13:57.437
"Wheat."

14:00.073 --> 14:02.509
Miles and miles of wheat.

14:04.978 --> 14:09.883
In an era of depression
and hardship

14:09.916 --> 14:14.988
there emerged a young man
struggling to save his family

14:15.021 --> 14:18.124
from a failed wheat crop
and economic decline.

14:19.526 --> 14:23.897
All while trying to realize
his dream of becoming an author.

14:31.004 --> 14:33.940
I’m Lawrence,
and this is my story...

14:36.109 --> 14:37.277
"...Wheat."

14:44.084 --> 14:45.619
This is my mother. Ma.

14:51.124 --> 14:53.326
Ma was a hard‐working woman

14:53.359 --> 14:57.263
who paid the price
of pioneer life.

14:57.297 --> 15:01.668
Her face was as dry and cracked
as the drought‐ridden earth.

15:06.540 --> 15:09.075
She was 40, but looked 60.

15:13.113 --> 15:16.349
Every afternoon,
Ma summoned me to supper

15:16.382 --> 15:19.119
with her pleasant,
almost melodic voice.

15:19.986 --> 15:21.387
Come and get it, Lawrence.

15:29.095 --> 15:30.597
But she wasn’t
feeling well today.

15:33.233 --> 15:36.469
Bu‐but no matter how she felt

15:36.503 --> 15:39.272
Ma was always waiting
there to greet me with a hug.

15:43.376 --> 15:44.578
Except Tuesday.

15:47.681 --> 15:50.316
There was no hugging
on Tuesdays.

15:52.252 --> 15:53.687
‐We always used to enjoy‐‐
‐Hello, Lawrence.

15:53.720 --> 15:55.622
‐It is I, your brother, Billy!
‐Not now! Not now!

15:55.656 --> 15:59.526
Get off the stage! Not now! Go,
go, go, go! Go away! Go away!

16:03.530 --> 16:05.465
We always used
to enjoy a visit‐‐

16:05.498 --> 16:07.200
[blabbering]

16:09.803 --> 16:12.706
We always used
to enjoy...a visit from...

16:14.440 --> 16:15.642
...from the Apple Lady.

16:24.217 --> 16:27.654
One of the Apple Lady’s favorite
activities was to gossip.

16:29.489 --> 16:32.659
Once she started talking
there was no stopping her.

16:32.693 --> 16:35.361
So, Apple Lady, what’s new?

16:37.831 --> 16:39.165
Well...

16:45.171 --> 16:47.674
So, Apple Lady...what’s new?

16:51.545 --> 16:53.146
Lydia. Lydia.

16:56.783 --> 17:00.120
One of the Apple Lady’s second
favorite activities

17:00.153 --> 17:03.423
was to come into a room
and stand there like a stone.

17:07.292 --> 17:09.530
Mary Anne?

17:09.563 --> 17:11.131
Hello, Lawrence!
It is I, your brother, Billy!

17:11.164 --> 17:13.567
Not now, not yet!
No! Get Mary Anne!

17:17.704 --> 17:22.675
Some of my fondest memories
were of my sweetheart love

17:22.709 --> 17:25.045
Bobbi Sue. Hi, Bobbi Sue!

17:28.682 --> 17:30.050
Hi, Lawrence!

17:31.718 --> 17:34.320
Bobbi Sue was very considerate.

17:34.354 --> 17:37.524
She always brought over a bottle
of fresh milk from her cow

17:37.558 --> 17:38.659
Bessie.

17:41.562 --> 17:44.264
I couldn’t find the milk.

17:44.297 --> 17:47.601
Lawrence, may I pour you a tall,
cold glass of...

17:50.236 --> 17:51.838
Oh, now that doesn’t
work at all, does it?

17:53.473 --> 17:57.544
And so Bobbi Sue and Ma

17:57.578 --> 17:59.646
moved to the big city.

17:59.680 --> 18:02.616
And they took the Apple Lady
with them

18:02.649 --> 18:04.785
to use as a doorstop.

18:07.654 --> 18:12.659
And‐and with Ma and the,
and the rest of them gone

18:12.693 --> 18:16.462
I was able to spend time alone
with my brother, Billy.

18:23.604 --> 18:25.138
My brother, Billy!

18:29.810 --> 18:32.746
Hello, Lawrence, it is I,
your brother, Billy!

18:36.382 --> 18:38.652
On the surface,
Billy was a... Oh, God!

18:40.654 --> 18:42.455
On the surface, Billy was a...

18:48.194 --> 18:50.931
On the surface,
Billy was a good kid

18:50.964 --> 18:53.499
but underneath there
lurked a time bomb

18:53.534 --> 18:54.801
waiting to explode.

18:54.835 --> 18:57.337
So, Billy

18:57.370 --> 19:01.775
who parked the thresher
down by Old Creek Bridge?

19:01.808 --> 19:05.211
I did! What are you gonna
do about it, huh?

19:05.245 --> 19:07.948
Nothing! Nothing!
I’m sorry I asked!

19:07.981 --> 19:09.516
‐You’re doing great!
‐Oh, thank you.

19:09.550 --> 19:10.884
I‐I’ve been practicing.

19:13.754 --> 19:16.690
Sure, Billy had his problems.

19:16.723 --> 19:19.793
Heck, we all had our problems

19:19.826 --> 19:21.895
but he was able
to bridge that gap.

19:23.697 --> 19:28.268
’Sometimes...Billy could
be an understanding’

19:28.301 --> 19:33.373
kind, thoughtful
and filled with compassion.

19:33.406 --> 19:35.241
A caring brother.

19:35.275 --> 19:38.879
Whose only thought was
the happiness of his family.

19:40.380 --> 19:44.518
Wherever Billy went
there was only love.

19:44.551 --> 19:46.620
Shut up and give me your lunch!

19:46.653 --> 19:48.188
[screaming]

19:59.933 --> 20:02.969
I guess today’s the day
that Billy goes off to college!

20:04.437 --> 20:07.373
Bye, Billy! Write!
He never will.

20:08.775 --> 20:11.845
Oh...so, where, where was I?
Oh, um...

20:14.014 --> 20:15.415
Wheat.

20:16.950 --> 20:19.686
Aha!

20:19.720 --> 20:20.821
Spring break already?

20:23.590 --> 20:24.958
Calm down, Balki.

20:26.993 --> 20:29.763
Billy had trouble
adjusting to college.

20:35.301 --> 20:37.871
And like many
struggling freshman

20:37.904 --> 20:41.441
he developed a bizarre
furniture throwing disorder.

20:42.075 --> 20:44.277
Ah!

20:44.310 --> 20:46.412
Sure, sure, there
were barriers between us.

20:47.948 --> 20:51.051
But Billy was always
able to tear ’em down. Oh, God.

20:51.084 --> 20:52.986
Now you’re going
off the bridge!

20:53.019 --> 20:54.420
[screaming]

20:57.558 --> 20:58.892
(female #1)
’Curtain!’

20:58.925 --> 20:59.993
Curtain? That’s my job!

21:01.762 --> 21:02.929
[upbeat music]

21:12.973 --> 21:15.509
Now let’s get you comfortable.

21:15.542 --> 21:18.912
Cousin, I’m... Cousin, I‐I’m
sorry I threw you off the stage.

21:18.945 --> 21:21.381
I’ll never forgive myself
for causing you to black out

21:21.414 --> 21:22.983
and miss my curtain closing.

21:25.118 --> 21:26.486
Oh, no, no, no,
Mary Anne, Mary Anne

21:26.520 --> 21:27.521
that‐that’s gonna be too high.

21:28.655 --> 21:31.658
Oh!

21:31.692 --> 21:33.694
No, Mary Anne, Mary Anne, that’s
the good cushion, don’t do that.

21:34.861 --> 21:35.896
Here, let’s try this one, okay?

21:35.929 --> 21:37.497
Okay. Oh!

21:42.969 --> 21:46.973
Oh...I know, I know.
I did it again.

21:47.007 --> 21:49.610
I couldn’t leave
well enough alone.

21:49.643 --> 21:51.377
If I hadn’t taken
over the play

21:51.411 --> 21:54.480
and insisted on doing it my way,
everything would have been fine.

21:54.515 --> 21:58.451
Oh, now, come on, cousin.
Don’t be so hard on yourself.

21:59.119 --> 22:00.053
‐Larry?
‐’Uh‐huh.’

22:00.086 --> 22:02.589
Are, are you ready
to read the review yet?

22:02.623 --> 22:03.890
Oh, no, no, please.

22:03.924 --> 22:08.795
I‐I don’t want to hear anything
that‐that reminds me of "Wheat."

22:08.829 --> 22:14.500
I‐I mean, I’m‐I’m just glad the
whole thing is‐is over and done.

22:14.535 --> 22:18.038
As far as I’m concerned it’s
just all water under the bridge.

22:20.741 --> 22:22.008
[screaming]

22:23.476 --> 22:25.011
[theme music]

22:32.018 --> 22:34.855
[theme music]
