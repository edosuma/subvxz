WEBVTT

00:00.790 --> 00:01.882
We should get married.

00:02.030 --> 00:04.590
Oh.

00:04.720 --> 00:06.062
I love you.

00:06.210 --> 00:08.269
I am fighting for you, and
I'm fighting for our marriage.

00:08.420 --> 00:09.273
We need to sign the papers,
Joel.

00:09.420 --> 00:11.934
This is what you want?

00:12.080 --> 00:13.900
[Adam]
Just got off the phone
with the insurance company.

00:14.040 --> 00:15.667
The numbers really worked out
in our favor.

00:15.800 --> 00:17.552
How would you feel ifI walked
away from The Luncheonette?

00:17.700 --> 00:19.452
I've thought it over,
and I don't want to cash out.

00:19.600 --> 00:22.592
Your heart, Zeek,
is just not as strong.

00:22.740 --> 00:24.776
We'll make the decision--
you and me.

00:26.920 --> 00:30.367
Jeez.

00:30.510 --> 00:32.535
[grunts]

00:32.680 --> 00:35.057
God. Oh, boy.

00:35.200 --> 00:36.929
Okay.

00:37.070 --> 00:38.139
That's right.

00:38.270 --> 00:41.068
Yeah.

00:41.210 --> 00:43.678
Okay.

00:43.830 --> 00:45.559
Millie.

00:45.700 --> 00:49.409
Millie! Millie!

00:49.560 --> 00:51.209
You bellowed, my darling?

00:51.360 --> 00:52.930
Yeah, do me a favor,
would you?

00:53.080 --> 00:55.287
Would you climb up here
and get my shoe box for me?

00:55.430 --> 00:57.113
What on earth for?

00:57.260 --> 00:59.319
Because it's got my
Reggie Jackson baseball in it,

00:59.470 --> 01:01.813
and I want to give it to my
great-grandson when he's born.

01:01.950 --> 01:03.190
Zeek.

01:03.330 --> 01:06.219
Or great-granddaughter.
Come on.

01:06.370 --> 01:08.543
No, it's just,
you love that ball.

01:08.680 --> 01:12.161
God, I've only heard the story
100,000 times.

01:12.310 --> 01:16.167
- April 4, 1972...
- Careful. That's right.

01:18.310 --> 01:20.449
- When all of a--
- Section J. Careful.

01:20.590 --> 01:21.727
Well, you talked about the day

01:21.870 --> 01:23.383
more than you talked
about our wedding day.

01:23.530 --> 01:25.384
Why you want to give the ball
to a baby?

01:25.530 --> 01:27.248
Not a baby.
It's our great-grandchild.

01:27.390 --> 01:29.836
Come on,
not just an ordinary baby.

01:33.300 --> 01:35.109
[Zeek sighs]

01:35.260 --> 01:38.957
Zeek, you know we're gonna
have to have a discussion

01:39.090 --> 01:41.160
about what the doctor said.

01:41.300 --> 01:42.289
We got to have it.

01:42.440 --> 01:43.475
You know,
about the next step.

01:43.620 --> 01:45.713
Yeah.
Right, I know that.

01:49.350 --> 01:51.375
Okay, baseball's not here.

01:51.520 --> 01:52.930
It's the wrong box.

01:53.070 --> 01:54.173
Yeah, but what are these?

01:54.320 --> 01:56.276
I have no idea.

01:56.420 --> 01:57.967
What the hell did I do
with my baseball?

01:58.110 --> 02:01.045
What could these be?
Oh, my God.

02:01.190 --> 02:02.384
I could've sworn
I put It up there.

02:02.530 --> 02:03.940
Can you believe
those jackasses

02:04.080 --> 02:05.081
took the Janis Joplin picture?

02:05.220 --> 02:06.949
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah.

02:07.090 --> 02:08.489
She was our spirit animal.

02:08.640 --> 02:10.460
I got so sick of looking
at this empty wall, though,

02:10.610 --> 02:12.498
that I went out
and procured us somebody.

02:12.640 --> 02:13.675
Cros, just slow down.

02:13.820 --> 02:15.435
Let's talk about this,
all right?

02:15.580 --> 02:17.263
Are you sure
you want to go ahead and try

02:17.410 --> 02:18.479
to make The Luncheonette work?

02:18.620 --> 02:20.508
I am 100% positive.

02:20.650 --> 02:22.208
You know who else is?

02:22.340 --> 02:23.921
These guys.

02:27.970 --> 02:29.380
- First day?
- Uh-huh.

02:29.520 --> 02:31.101
One guy doesn't even know
what reverb is.

02:31.250 --> 02:32.478
- That's you.
- Mm-hmm. Right here.

02:32.630 --> 02:34.552
The other guy doesn't know
how to run a business.

02:34.700 --> 02:36.076
That's me.

02:36.220 --> 02:38.324
Three years later, I still don't
know how to run a business,

02:38.460 --> 02:39.734
but despite that,
I get to come to a place

02:39.880 --> 02:41.222
I love every single day

02:41.360 --> 02:43.396
because I have the greatest
partner in the world.

02:43.540 --> 02:45.531
[mellow alternative music]

02:45.680 --> 02:48.467
Well, it's been a hell
of a ride, that's for sure.

02:48.610 --> 02:50.020
That's right.
Sure has.

02:50.170 --> 02:51.296
Rocky and turbulent,

02:51.440 --> 02:53.123
and it's just getting started
because,

02:53.270 --> 02:55.090
like our spirit animal says,

02:55.240 --> 02:58.368
"Freedom is just another word
for nothing left to lose."

02:58.520 --> 03:01.409
And we officially
have nothing left to lose, 50--

03:01.560 --> 03:02.868
You got that right.

03:03.010 --> 03:04.864
I can feel the mojo
coming back right now

03:05.010 --> 03:05.897
just looking at this.

03:06.040 --> 03:07.280
Right?
Yeah.

03:07.420 --> 03:08.489
[door slides open]

03:13.190 --> 03:15.977
[sirens in the distance]

03:52.090 --> 03:54.911
[grunts]

03:55.060 --> 03:56.368
[exhales]

03:59.370 --> 04:02.407
I don't think
you need to do that anymore.

04:05.380 --> 04:06.586
- I think that looks good.
- Hey.

04:06.720 --> 04:07.823
Yeah.

04:09.380 --> 04:11.200
Can we talk
about the thing?

04:11.350 --> 04:12.965
What?
What thing?

04:13.110 --> 04:15.487
The giant tomato
in the room?

04:15.630 --> 04:17.245
Well, it's an elephant.
We both know that.

04:17.390 --> 04:19.005
- Well...
- We've learned that.

04:19.150 --> 04:21.118
To me,
now it's a tomato.

04:21.260 --> 04:22.568
What?
What about--what?

04:22.710 --> 04:24.018
- "What?"
- Yeah. I said it. I mean--

04:24.160 --> 04:25.707
Was that for real?
I mean--

04:25.850 --> 04:27.329
What do I--
I said everything.

04:27.470 --> 04:28.607
You said--you know--

04:28.750 --> 04:31.264
blurted out a proposal
outside of the ER,

04:31.400 --> 04:33.049
and then we never
talked about it again.

04:33.200 --> 04:35.407
And I just feel like

04:35.550 --> 04:37.120
is it one of those things
where, you know,

04:37.270 --> 04:39.647
everything was high pressure,
and nobody had slept,

04:39.790 --> 04:41.303
and my dad,
and, you know, like,

04:41.450 --> 04:43.657
when you have--
feel like a plane's going down,

04:43.800 --> 04:45.859
you just blurt out things
you don't really mean.

04:46.000 --> 04:47.820
No, I mean, why--
why would you think that?

04:47.970 --> 04:49.585
Because it seemed
very unplanned and--

04:49.730 --> 04:51.459
So what?
Why does it have to be planned?

04:51.600 --> 04:53.659
Because, oh, I don't know,
it's the rest of your life?

04:53.810 --> 04:55.209
I don't--
what do you want me to say?

04:55.360 --> 04:57.112
You want me to--I'm--

04:57.260 --> 04:58.181
I can't say it again.

04:58.330 --> 04:59.706
I said it.

04:59.850 --> 05:01.363
I said everything
I wanted to say.

05:01.500 --> 05:03.502
I said I love you,
and I want to spend the rest

05:03.640 --> 05:05.369
of my life with you,

05:05.510 --> 05:06.534
and I want you.

05:06.680 --> 05:09.604
I want you richer or poorer,

05:09.750 --> 05:12.196
better or worse,
the whole wedding enchilada.

05:12.340 --> 05:14.513
It was high pressure,
and it was emotional.

05:14.650 --> 05:17.539
May not have been
the right place, but I meant it.

05:17.690 --> 05:21.239
I meant every word of it.

05:21.390 --> 05:23.483
There's the tomato.

05:23.630 --> 05:26.076
It's in your hands now,
the tomato.

05:40.090 --> 05:44.618
[woman]
Let the day
settle in my lungs

05:44.750 --> 05:49.540
As I die out in the sun

05:49.690 --> 05:53.103
Just let me think alone

05:53.240 --> 05:54.343
[typing]

05:54.490 --> 05:57.129
Why do I throw the stones?

05:57.280 --> 06:00.625
[phone ringing]

06:00.770 --> 06:01.839
- Hey.
- Hey.

06:01.980 --> 06:03.424
- Everything okay?
- Yeah.

06:03.570 --> 06:07.779
Um, Joel...

06:09.290 --> 06:10.496
What are we doing?

06:10.640 --> 06:15.054
Yeah, I know.
It's been on my mind a lot.

06:15.200 --> 06:16.155
I didn't want to press with,

06:16.300 --> 06:17.369
you know--with your dad,

06:17.510 --> 06:20.195
but we should get together
and talk.

06:20.340 --> 06:22.160
How about--how about now?

06:22.310 --> 06:23.857
Like now, now?

06:24.000 --> 06:25.069
Yeah, right now.

06:25.210 --> 06:26.757
Unless you're busy.

06:26.900 --> 06:28.481
No.
No, I'm not busy.

06:28.620 --> 06:29.484
Okay.

06:29.630 --> 06:31.313
Um...

06:31.460 --> 06:33.382
[Joel]
Yeah.

06:33.530 --> 06:35.998
[sighs]
So. ..

06:36.150 --> 06:38.903
[sighs]
Yeah.

06:41.470 --> 06:43.779
Well...

06:43.920 --> 06:47.219
Jules, we can't--
We got to do this in person.

06:47.370 --> 06:48.291
Oh.
Well, come over.

06:48.440 --> 06:49.293
On my way.

06:49.440 --> 06:50.839
Okay.

06:54.030 --> 06:55.406
Oh, God.

06:58.340 --> 06:59.443
[knocking]

07:03.180 --> 07:04.033
Hi.

07:04.180 --> 07:05.101
Hi.

07:15.400 --> 07:17.777
[Bob Dylan]
May God bless
and keep you always

07:17.920 --> 07:20.081
And may your wishes
all come true

07:20.230 --> 07:22.437
May you always do
for others

07:22.580 --> 07:24.775
And let others do for you

07:24.920 --> 07:27.718
May you build a ladder
to the stars

07:27.860 --> 07:29.407
And climb on every rung

07:29.550 --> 07:31.575
And may you stay

07:31.720 --> 07:34.609
Forever young

07:34.760 --> 07:37.137
May you grow up
to be righteous

07:37.280 --> 07:39.487
May you grow up
to be true

07:39.630 --> 07:41.791
May you always know
the truth

07:41.940 --> 07:44.101
And see the lights
surrounding you

07:44.250 --> 07:46.696
May you always be
courageous

07:46.840 --> 07:48.762
Stand upright
and be strong

07:48.910 --> 07:50.662
And may you stay

07:50.810 --> 07:53.677
Forever young

07:53.810 --> 07:56.017
May you stay

07:56.160 --> 07:57.843
Forever young

08:06.760 --> 08:07.749
Mm.

08:07.900 --> 08:09.299
- Mm.
- Mm.

08:09.450 --> 08:10.439
Morning.

08:10.590 --> 08:12.342
Mm.

08:12.490 --> 08:13.798
So that happened.

08:13.940 --> 08:15.510
Mm.

08:15.660 --> 08:17.173
It did, didn't it?

08:17.320 --> 08:20.073
I'm pretty sure--
pretty sure it did.

08:20.220 --> 08:23.872
I'm pretty sure
it's needs to happen again.

08:24.020 --> 08:25.942
We need to--
We do still need to talk.

08:26.090 --> 08:26.943
Absolutely.

08:27.090 --> 08:28.159
Okay, just--

08:28.300 --> 08:29.426
- We will.
- We're clear about this.

08:29.570 --> 08:31.879
- Yeah, just--
- Uh-huh.

08:37.680 --> 08:38.851
[Sydney]
Mom.

08:39.000 --> 08:40.854
Mom, why is the door locked?

08:41.000 --> 08:43.275
This is confusing.
Get--hide.

08:43.410 --> 08:44.616
Um, the door's locked

08:44.760 --> 08:48.719
because I am looking
for my robe, sweetheart.

08:48.870 --> 08:50.758
And let me find it.

08:50.900 --> 08:54.210
So as soon as I find my robe,
um,

08:54.360 --> 08:57.978
then you can come in,
which is right now.

08:58.120 --> 08:59.257
Hi.

08:59.400 --> 09:00.469
So what's up?

09:00.600 --> 09:02.079
Mom, I left my flute
at Dad's.

09:02.230 --> 09:03.982
- Okay. Well, what--
- And I need it for band today.

09:04.120 --> 09:07.294
Good, well, we will go by
his house on the way to school.

09:07.440 --> 09:08.771
No, we won't.

09:08.920 --> 09:10.330
We will have Dad
drop it off at school for you.

09:10.480 --> 09:11.333
- Okay.
- Okay.

09:11.480 --> 09:12.401
- I'll text him.
- No, no.

09:12.550 --> 09:15.474
I can, uh--

09:15.620 --> 09:16.780
Oh, I can text him for you.

09:16.930 --> 09:18.306
I can call him for you
if you want.

09:18.450 --> 09:19.417
- I'm faster.
- Okay.

09:19.550 --> 09:21.199
[typing]

09:25.280 --> 09:26.178
Great.

09:26.320 --> 09:27.218
[cell phone pings]

09:30.500 --> 09:33.492
Uh, that was my phone, huh?

09:33.640 --> 09:36.359
You don't have any texts.

09:36.500 --> 09:37.353
[cell phone pings]

09:37.500 --> 09:38.706
Look, it was my phone.

09:38.850 --> 09:40.249
That was Dad telling you
that he'll be there.

09:40.400 --> 09:42.504
He'll bring it,
and it's perfect.

09:42.650 --> 09:44.857
His message
has a lot of typos.

09:44.990 --> 09:46.298
Yeah, he must be in a rush,
which we are too.

09:46.440 --> 09:48.169
- Let's get you off to school.
- No, we're not.

09:48.310 --> 09:49.993
- Yeah, we are. Let's--
- Look, I'm completely ready.

09:50.140 --> 09:50.925
- I even got my coat on...
- Did you eat breakfast?

09:51.070 --> 09:52.298
- Yes?
- And shoes. Yes.

09:52.450 --> 09:53.792
Hey.

09:53.930 --> 09:54.749
Mom, Dad,
what are you doing here?

09:54.900 --> 09:56.174
- Hey.
- Hi.

09:56.310 --> 09:58.278
- Well, look what we got.
- What do you got?

09:58.420 --> 09:59.318
A project
for my grandson.

09:59.460 --> 10:00.768
Where is he?

10:00.910 --> 10:02.002
- Oh. Hey, Max.
- What kind of project?

10:02.150 --> 10:04.664
Well, I think one that
you're gonna be interested in.

10:08.840 --> 10:10.353
- How old are these?
- Well, nobody knows.

10:10.500 --> 10:11.319
Why don't you tell me?

10:11.470 --> 10:12.949
Yeah.

10:13.090 --> 10:14.398
Your grandpa likes
to throw things in shoe boxes

10:14.540 --> 10:15.882
and then forget about 'em.

10:16.020 --> 10:17.464
A shoe box is a terrible place
to keep film.

10:17.610 --> 10:19.498
They should be kept
somewhere cool and dry.

10:19.650 --> 10:20.639
That was stupid, Grandpa.

10:20.790 --> 10:21.927
Can I have extra screen time

10:22.060 --> 10:23.925
in order to find out
what year these are from?

10:24.070 --> 10:25.162
Oh, I vote yes on that.

10:25.310 --> 10:26.402
All right,
saved by the grandmother.

10:26.550 --> 10:27.619
- Awesome.
- 15 minutes.

10:27.760 --> 10:30.968
- You got to go to school.
- Grandpa.

10:31.110 --> 10:32.589
- I'll g--I'll go.
- Yeah.

10:32.730 --> 10:34.243
- Max?
- The mysterious film.

10:34.390 --> 10:35.766
Hey, listen.

10:35.910 --> 10:38.140
- Can I talk to you for a sec?
- Yeah.

10:38.290 --> 10:41.145
Your mother told me
about the break-in.

10:41.290 --> 10:42.325
She wasn't
supposed to do that.

10:42.460 --> 10:43.597
We didn't want
to stress you out.

10:43.740 --> 10:44.729
Oh, really?

10:44.880 --> 10:46.108
Well, you kids
not telling me stuff

10:46.260 --> 10:47.568
stresses me out
more than that.

10:47.710 --> 10:49.052
- So what's going on?
- I'm sorry.

10:49.200 --> 10:50.269
But everything's fine.
Okay?

10:50.400 --> 10:51.844
Everything's fine?

10:51.990 --> 10:53.298
- It's all good.
- It's all good.

10:53.440 --> 10:54.668
- Yeah. It's all good.
- Yeah.

10:54.820 --> 10:56.469
Why am I not convinced here?

10:56.620 --> 10:58.406
- It's all good?
- Dad, it's fine.

10:58.550 --> 11:01.997
It's just that...

11:02.140 --> 11:03.653
- [laughs]
- [sighs]

11:03.800 --> 11:05.301
[chuckles]

11:05.450 --> 11:06.929
- All right. All right.
- Oh, man.

11:07.080 --> 11:08.001
You don't want me
to hold anything back from you?

11:08.150 --> 11:08.832
You never_--
you never could lie to me.

11:08.970 --> 11:10.380
Yeah, well--
[sighs]

11:10.530 --> 11:12.179
Come on, Adam.

11:12.320 --> 11:14.288
All right,
I want out of The Luncheonette.

11:14.430 --> 11:15.658
Out of the business?

11:15.810 --> 11:17.425
You know,
it's been so hard recently

11:17.570 --> 11:18.878
for us to turn any profit.

11:19.020 --> 11:21.329
We're just getting
deeper and deeper into debt,

11:21.470 --> 11:23.529
and I felt like this insurance
money could lIberate us.

11:23.680 --> 11:25.739
It's enough for us
to just have a clean break,

11:25.890 --> 11:27.198
and I just want to move on

11:27.340 --> 11:29.331
and figure out
what I want to do next--

11:29.480 --> 11:30.640
what I want to do
with my life.

11:30.790 --> 11:33.167
But I can't,
because this is--

11:33.310 --> 11:35.028
it's Crosby's dream.

11:35.170 --> 11:36.307
That's what's going on.

11:36.450 --> 11:37.678
Well, Crosby's old enough

11:37.830 --> 11:40.207
to know that dreams
get put on hold, you know?

11:40.350 --> 11:41.419
But this wouldn't be
putting it on hold, Dad.

11:41.560 --> 11:43.278
This would be killing it--
destroying it.

11:43.420 --> 11:46.969
The Luncheonette would be over,
and Crosby would be crushed.

11:47.120 --> 11:50.112
Anyway, that's been
on my mind, but--

11:50.260 --> 11:52.399
Well, you got to do what's
best for your family, Son.

11:52.530 --> 11:54.111
Right?

11:54.260 --> 11:58.538
He is my family.
He's my little brother.

11:58.680 --> 12:00.227
Crosby's turned
into quite a man.

12:00.370 --> 12:02.509
You know,
he surprised a lot of us.

12:02.650 --> 12:07.098
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, he can handle this.

12:07.240 --> 12:09.094
I think it's time
that you let it go--

12:09.240 --> 12:12.277
that you got to do
what's right for you, Son.

12:15.210 --> 12:17.178
Give me that thing.

12:17.320 --> 12:18.526
This is H2.

12:18.660 --> 12:19.900
- Why do you want H2 now?
- What do you mean?

12:20.040 --> 12:22.042
- This is not--
- A piece--H2 doesn't go--

12:22.180 --> 12:24.045
- You just jam it in.
- We don't even get to H2 till--

12:24.190 --> 12:26.181
Here.

12:26.330 --> 12:28.082
Ah, Mom.

12:28.230 --> 12:29.117
Wait.

12:29.260 --> 12:30.113
Oh, my God.

12:30.260 --> 12:31.363
Even if we put this together
right,

12:31.500 --> 12:33.320
I am too scared
to put my Child In It.

12:33.470 --> 12:35.358
- No, this is gonna work.
- You jammed it in too far.

12:35.510 --> 12:36.670
No, no, no, no.

12:36.820 --> 12:38.572
[sighs]
This is, like, ridiculous.

12:38.720 --> 12:40.119
- This is so ridiculous.
- Hey.

12:40.270 --> 12:41.714
- This thing is so stupid.
- Hey.

12:41.860 --> 12:43.088
Screw this.
It's typical.

12:43.240 --> 12:45.037
It's a typical Dad thing
to do,

12:45.170 --> 12:48.037
to, like, send something
and try to get the credit

12:48.180 --> 12:51.411
and then actually stick us
with all of the hard work,

12:51.560 --> 12:54.028
like, not be helpful at all,

12:54.180 --> 12:58.184
just like with everything
of his entire life.

12:58.320 --> 13:01.801
Sorry you didn't have
a better dad.

13:01.950 --> 13:04.350
It's times like this
when it's really--

13:04.500 --> 13:06.013
No, Mom, it's not--

13:06.160 --> 13:07.229
it's not your fault either.

13:07.370 --> 13:08.507
I'm--

13:08.640 --> 13:10.153
I'm just stressed

13:10.300 --> 13:14.191
because it's hard
to do all this stuff alone,

13:14.340 --> 13:19.277
and I'm basically
bringing a child into the world

13:19.410 --> 13:22.789
to do everything alone
as well.

13:22.940 --> 13:24.248
You made a decision,

13:24.380 --> 13:27.247
and you don't know
that Ryan won't be there.

13:27.390 --> 13:29.620
You're trying to stand up
for yourself and make sure

13:29.770 --> 13:31.146
he's healthy
if he comes around,

13:31.290 --> 13:33.804
and you'll figure it out.

13:33.950 --> 13:36.259
And then we'll hire somebody
to put this crib together.

13:36.400 --> 13:37.731
[laughs]

13:37.880 --> 13:39.359
- Hey, Cros.
- Hey.

13:39.500 --> 13:41.149
- Can we talk for a second?
- Yeah, man.

13:41.300 --> 13:42.699
There's _some nice stuff
In here.

13:42.850 --> 13:45.057
This 1176...

13:45.200 --> 13:46.713
- Oh, yeah?
- Analog display.

13:46.860 --> 13:48.509
- Look _how sweet that is.
- Well, It looks pretty cool.

13:48.650 --> 13:51.403
Yeah, I'm almost excited
we got robbed.

13:51.550 --> 13:55.236
Hey, can you
set that aside for a second?

13:55.380 --> 13:57.109
'Cause I've been doing
some pretty serious thinking--

13:57.250 --> 13:58.239
a lot of thinking...

13:58.380 --> 13:59.278
Uh-huh?

13:59.420 --> 14:00.512
About our future,

14:00.660 --> 14:04.289
and, you know,
I really think the best thing

14:04.420 --> 14:06.149
for us to do here
is to fold.

14:09.740 --> 14:12.425
Okay, so you want to close
the business up again?

14:12.570 --> 14:13.491
I do.

14:13.640 --> 14:14.948
Look, it's been great here,

14:15.090 --> 14:16.500
but I think
it's what's best for both of us.

14:16.640 --> 14:18.153
It's not what's best for me.

14:18.300 --> 14:22.054
Well, it feels like
that's what's best for me.

14:24.270 --> 14:26.238
I have loved working with you.
You know that.

14:26.380 --> 14:27.995
I wouldn't trade
these last years for anything.

14:28.140 --> 14:29.414
It was great.

14:29.550 --> 14:31.962
Ijust feel like
I want to get out from under,

14:32.110 --> 14:36.274
and I think
it's the responsible and--

14:36.420 --> 14:37.523
- Yeah.
- It's the right thing to do.

14:37.660 --> 14:39.901
- Yep.
- I'm sorry.

14:40.050 --> 14:41.870
I totally understand.

14:42.010 --> 14:45.286
Um, you have a family,
and I have a family,

14:45.430 --> 14:49.298
so, yeah, don't--
don't feel bad about it.

14:51.850 --> 14:53.021
You know what?
We had a good run.

14:53.160 --> 14:55.720
Yeah, a good run.

14:55.860 --> 14:58.476
Yeah.

14:58.620 --> 15:01.236
And maybe this is just

15:01.380 --> 15:03.439
what we needed to move on.

15:08.390 --> 15:09.345
[door closes]
- Hey.

15:09.490 --> 15:10.479
Oh. Hi.

15:10.630 --> 15:11.380
What are you doing?

15:11.530 --> 15:14.317
Um, I thought
you had a job.

15:14.460 --> 15:15.939
- It said on the schedule--
- Yeah, it got cancelled.

15:16.080 --> 15:17.149
I mean, not that
I didn't want to see you,

15:17.290 --> 15:18.325
but I was not planning.

15:18.460 --> 15:19.779
Yeah, I know.
What are you doing?

15:19.910 --> 15:21.730
Amber and I are
putting together her crib,

15:21.880 --> 15:23.086
and we don't have a hammer.

15:23.230 --> 15:24.743
Both of you guys
are gonna put a crib together

15:24.880 --> 15:25.949
that a live baby goes in?

15:26.090 --> 15:27.671
Uh, yes.
Do you have a--

15:27.820 --> 15:29.264
Are you qualified?
I mean--

15:29.410 --> 15:31.196
I don't know.
It's--we're working on it.

15:31.340 --> 15:34.161
You have a hard time
with Velcro sometimes.

15:34.310 --> 15:35.447
All right. Be careful.
I mean--

15:35.580 --> 15:37.821
- Thank you.
- That's all you need?

15:37.970 --> 15:39.926
- Uh, so far, yeah.
- All right.

15:40.070 --> 15:42.061
So I know, um--

15:42.210 --> 15:44.201
Yeah, I know.
But that's all right.

15:44.350 --> 15:46.910
- I'm just taking my time to--
- I know.

15:47.040 --> 15:48.007
You go to weigh it all.

15:48.150 --> 15:49.424
Lot of reasons to say no.

15:49.560 --> 15:51.255
- I get that.
- It's not even like that.

15:51.390 --> 15:52.709
It's not, like,
a list or anything.

15:52.840 --> 15:54.523
What if it was?
What's the, like, some of the--

15:54.670 --> 15:56.251
What would be on the list?
What's some of the--

15:56.400 --> 15:58.083
If there was a list
of pros and cons?

15:58.230 --> 16:00.198
Yeah, what's the reasons
for "no"? What would be a--

16:00.330 --> 16:02.503
- Oh, I don't--it's not like--
- Top three.

16:02.650 --> 16:05.164
I just, you know, it's
all the stuff we talked about.

16:05.300 --> 16:07.336
- It's like, do we communicate?
- Yeah, I know.

16:07.480 --> 16:10.096
And can we grow together?

16:10.240 --> 16:11.059
- I'm working on 'em.
- I know.

16:11.210 --> 16:12.438
I mean, you know that.

16:12.590 --> 16:14.205
I'm just older now,
and I need more time.

16:14.350 --> 16:15.965
[Max]
Hey!

16:16.110 --> 16:17.657
I understand that I don't
have studio time scheduled now,

16:20.010 --> 16:22.456
I hold in my hand seven
canisters of undeveloped film...

16:22.600 --> 16:23.976
Hi, Max.

16:24.120 --> 16:26.873
Spanning decades, and they
need to be developed right now!

16:27.020 --> 16:29.159
[chuckles]
Aanay. ..

16:29.290 --> 16:31.110
- All right.
- Go.

16:31.260 --> 16:32.329
Yeah, I mean,
this is not a--

16:32.470 --> 16:33.949
- This is not one of those--
- Mm-mm.

16:34.090 --> 16:36.433
No--this isn't on the "no" list,
right, that I did this?

16:36.580 --> 16:37.956
No, with him,
it's one of the good things.

16:38.100 --> 16:40.125
- So it's a good thing, right?
- I'll talk to you later.

16:40.270 --> 16:41.020
- All right.
- As soon as possible.

16:41.170 --> 16:43.786
All right.

16:43.930 --> 16:44.999
What do you got?
Give me that.

16:45.140 --> 16:47.779
Why are you going
like that?

16:47.930 --> 16:50.239
Looks crazy.
What is that for?

16:50.380 --> 16:52.769
_ It focuses the--
It focuses It on your abs.

16:52.900 --> 16:54.583
- It doesn't help anything.
- Yeah, it does.

16:54.730 --> 16:57.005
It's, like,
baby pregnancy stuff.

16:57.150 --> 16:58.048
It helps you focus.

16:58.180 --> 16:59.499
So finish the story, though.

16:59.630 --> 17:01.450
The kids saw him,
or they didn't see him?

17:01.600 --> 17:03.704
Didn't see him.
I'm so glad they didn't see him.

17:03.850 --> 17:06.227
I'm hiding the father
of my children from my children.

17:06.370 --> 17:07.769
- Wow. How's that feel?
- I don't know.

17:07.920 --> 17:10.081
It feels crazy, but it feels
like it's the right thing to do.

17:10.230 --> 17:11.913
- What are you guys gonna do?
- We're gonna weigh it out.

17:12.060 --> 17:13.368
We're gonna
make sure that--

17:13.510 --> 17:15.478
How long do you wait
before you know something?

17:15.620 --> 17:17.269
Just until you've weighed
everything out,

17:17.410 --> 17:19.583
and you--and then we'll know,
and we'll do it.

17:19.720 --> 17:22.541
Hey,
Hank asked me to marry him.

17:25.280 --> 17:26.690
I didn't know what to say,

17:26.830 --> 17:29.003
and now I still kind of
don't know what to say, and--

17:29.150 --> 17:30.242
That's fantastic, though.

17:30.390 --> 17:31.414
- That's amazing.
- Thank you.

17:31.560 --> 17:33.039
- Well, yeah.
- [sighs]

17:33.190 --> 17:35.112
He has--We haven't talked
about it since, so, you know,

17:35.260 --> 17:36.454
is that the rest of my life?

17:36.600 --> 17:39.080
I mean, I love him, but it's--

17:39.230 --> 17:40.151
he's complicated, and--

17:40.300 --> 17:41.801
- Mm-hmm.
- I don't know.

17:41.950 --> 17:44.191
My gut has steered me so wrong
so many times.

17:44.330 --> 17:45.467
I just don't want
to make a mistake.

17:45.610 --> 17:46.224
You want to weigh it out.
You want to make--

17:46.370 --> 17:47.268
- Yes.
- Yeah, I know.

17:47.410 --> 17:49.059
Okay.
We're not 20 years old.

17:49.200 --> 17:50.269
We have children
to think of with--

17:50.410 --> 17:51.434
Yeah.
What do you recommend?

17:51.580 --> 17:53.229
We make a list
of pros and cons.

17:53.380 --> 17:55.371
We're going to list reasons
to marry Hank...

17:55.520 --> 17:57.033
No.
That feels so not romantic.

17:57.170 --> 17:58.376
Reasons not to marry Hank.

17:58.520 --> 17:59.726
Well, but you just said

17:59.870 --> 18:01.246
you want to make
a practical decision.

18:01.390 --> 18:03.767
- This is the way to do that.
- Okay.

18:03.910 --> 18:05.104
Do you have paper and a pen?

18:05.250 --> 18:06.524
I have--

18:06.670 --> 18:08.046
Oh, man, I always forget.
Okay.

18:08.190 --> 18:09.999
Pros.

18:10.150 --> 18:12.596
Pros: um,

18:12.740 --> 18:15.425
um, stable,

18:15.570 --> 18:17.128
- kind...
- Mm-hmm.

18:17.260 --> 18:18.056
- Funny...
- Mm-hmm.

18:18.200 --> 18:21.294
Good with the family,

18:21.440 --> 18:22.987
taller than me.

18:23.130 --> 18:24.438
Important.

18:24.580 --> 18:25.547
Not a deal breaker,
but it was a plus.

18:25.690 --> 18:27.260
- No. Yes.
- Um...

18:27.410 --> 18:29.787
- Oh, I know, I know.
[door opens]

18:29.930 --> 18:30.965
Hey, look who's back.

18:31.110 --> 18:32.998
It's Daddy. Yay.

18:33.140 --> 18:34.209
- Hey.
- Hi, guys.

18:34.350 --> 18:36.489
What are you doing,
playing hoolq?

18:36.630 --> 18:38.382
[sighs]

18:41.670 --> 18:43.456
[Jasmine]
Hey, let's go see Daddy.

18:43.600 --> 18:44.498
Come on.

18:44.640 --> 18:45.493
[sighs]

18:45.640 --> 18:47.323
See Daddy.

18:50.190 --> 18:51.634
Hey.

18:51.780 --> 18:53.463
You okay?

18:53.610 --> 18:55.123
Yeah.

18:57.060 --> 19:00.029
What's up?

19:00.170 --> 19:03.401
Um...[clears throat]
it's over.

19:03.550 --> 19:07.099
It's--He's--
Adam's walking away, so--

19:07.240 --> 19:10.061
Oh.

19:10.210 --> 19:13.794
Oh, baby, I'm sorry.

19:25.370 --> 19:27.258
It was nice.

19:27.400 --> 19:28.321
Nice?

19:28.470 --> 19:30.779
It was nearly a disaster.

19:30.920 --> 19:33.263
The kids--I mean, Joel,
we put them through so much.

19:33.410 --> 19:34.889
We just can't confuse them.

19:35.030 --> 19:37.134
We can't give them
false hope.

19:37.270 --> 19:38.305
I'm sorry,
would it be false hope?

19:38.450 --> 19:39.781
I don't know that.

19:39.930 --> 19:44.060
Okay, I guess, in that case,
after last night,

19:44.210 --> 19:45.484
I guess I was having a little
bit of false hope myself.

19:45.630 --> 19:50.420
Okay, Joel, no.
There's--there's hope.

19:50.560 --> 19:52.209
We just have to do
a lot of work.

19:52.360 --> 19:53.213
- Yes.
- Yes.

19:53.360 --> 19:54.349
- And I'm in.
- Okay.

19:54.500 --> 19:55.592
I'm ready.
Whatever it takes.

19:55.740 --> 19:57.116
Well, good.

19:57.260 --> 20:01.219
We just--we have to do that
before we can tell the kids...

20:01.370 --> 20:02.849
Okay.

20:02.990 --> 20:05.026
Because we have to come
to the other side of this thing

20:05.160 --> 20:06.366
and know that we can make it.

20:06.510 --> 20:08.887
If we don't make it,
it's just too much for them.

20:09.030 --> 20:10.611
- We can't--
- Honey.

20:10.760 --> 20:12.443
Yeah.

20:12.590 --> 20:15.411
I love you, and I'm in.

20:15.550 --> 20:17.279
Whatever it is,
we will work it out.

20:17.420 --> 20:19.172
Good. Okay.

20:19.320 --> 20:23.245
So for instance,
what about Chris?

20:23.390 --> 20:25.176
So what about--
I thought that was over.

20:25.320 --> 20:26.730
That is over,
but I work with him.

20:26.880 --> 20:28.279
Uh-huh.

20:28.430 --> 20:31.228
And I'm not really
in a position to quit my job.

20:31.360 --> 20:33.089
I mean,
I don't want to quit my job.

20:33.230 --> 20:34.367
I like my job.

20:34.500 --> 20:36.229
I like my clients
and my cases,

20:36.370 --> 20:39.123
and I feel good
about myself there.

20:39.270 --> 20:41.329
I guess, um...

20:41.480 --> 20:43.505
Yeah, I guess I'll just--

20:43.650 --> 20:46.585
I guess I'll just have
to deal with it.

20:46.720 --> 20:49.439
Okay, and what about me?

20:49.590 --> 20:51.820
Well, you're a hot mess.

20:51.970 --> 20:53.722
- We know that.
- That's--Listen, I'm serious.

20:53.870 --> 20:57.522
I've been very emotional lately
with my dad and previously,

20:57.670 --> 20:59.479
and I've always thought
logically...

20:59.630 --> 21:00.904
- Okay, I know.
- And clearly.

21:01.050 --> 21:02.426
Listen, we're both emotional
right now,

21:02.570 --> 21:03.832
but when have you
not thought clearly?

21:03.980 --> 21:05.493
Two years ago,

21:05.640 --> 21:08.700
I was not thinking clearly.

21:08.850 --> 21:11.193
I was pretty much unraveling,

21:11.330 --> 21:14.151
and you left.

21:14.300 --> 21:15.574
Yeah, that's not
gonna happen again.

21:15.720 --> 21:19.611
Good, but I can't tell you
that it won't happen again,

21:19.760 --> 21:22.399
that I'll be--
I don't know.

21:22.550 --> 21:24.927
I know that I was hard
to live with.

21:25.070 --> 21:28.176
I realize that it was rough.

21:28.320 --> 21:33.735
Honey, I will tell you this
as many times as you need me to:

21:33.870 --> 21:36.521
I will never leave you again.

21:36.670 --> 21:39.355
I will never leave you.

21:44.300 --> 21:45.847
[sighs]

21:51.100 --> 21:51.998
[grunts]

21:54.140 --> 21:57.166
[grunts]

21:57.310 --> 21:59.232
Bingo!

21:59.380 --> 22:00.893
What is all this stuff?

22:01.040 --> 22:04.931
This, Grandson, is what 72 years
of memories looks like.

22:06.110 --> 22:07.907
Right,
so what are we looking for?

22:08.050 --> 22:12.760
We are looking for a baseball
in a shoe box.

22:12.910 --> 22:16.118
Baseball--Well, there's
shoe boxes everywhere,

22:16.260 --> 22:17.158
- but I can--
- Yeah.

22:17.300 --> 22:19.461
Oh, boy, we got our--

22:19.610 --> 22:23.364
We got our work
cut out for us, don't we?

22:30.310 --> 22:31.208
Oh, God.

22:31.350 --> 22:34.342
Well, shoes and whatnot.

22:36.040 --> 22:37.792
Are you okay?

22:37.940 --> 22:39.077
Oh, man, yeah.

22:39.210 --> 22:40.905
Well, I've felt better,
if you know what I mean.

22:41.040 --> 22:42.041
Yeah.

22:45.980 --> 22:49.393
Um, hey, Grandpa,

22:49.540 --> 22:51.917
I just want to say that

22:52.060 --> 22:55.086
I'm so sorry about ruining
the trip to France.

22:55.230 --> 22:56.219
Oh, gosh.

22:56.370 --> 22:57.462
I really am.

22:57.610 --> 23:00.477
I did not mean to do that,
you know?

23:00.620 --> 23:03.088
That's just
all I can think about.

23:03.240 --> 23:07.893
When you had the heart attack,
it's just, like, you know,

23:08.040 --> 23:10.247
what if--
like, what if I lost you,

23:10.380 --> 23:12.007
and I didn't--

23:12.140 --> 23:12.959
and you were mad at me?

23:13.110 --> 23:14.486
Oh, man.

23:14.630 --> 23:16.109
I don't even know
how I would've been able

23:16.250 --> 23:17.069
to live with that,

23:17.220 --> 23:18.767
and I'm just--

23:18.910 --> 23:20.423
I really am so sorry.
1--

23:20.570 --> 23:21.764
Oh, Grandson, come on.

23:21.910 --> 23:23.252
Tying yourself in knots
over this--

23:23.400 --> 23:24.287
Come here a minute.

23:24.430 --> 23:25.874
I'm sorry, Grandpa.

23:26.020 --> 23:27.055
- Hey.
- I really am.

23:27.190 --> 23:28.839
Come on.
Gosh, Drew.

23:28.990 --> 23:31.675
It's okay.

23:31.820 --> 23:35.540
I mean, I was scared,
you know?

23:35.690 --> 23:37.260
When that happens,
the last thing you're gonna

23:37.410 --> 23:41.369
hold on to is anger
for anybody or anything, right?

23:41.520 --> 23:43.488
Yeah.

23:43.620 --> 23:45.133
I don't like thinking about it.

23:45.280 --> 23:47.419
Well, I don't either,
but, I mean, it's gonna happen.

23:47.560 --> 23:49.175
And when it does happen,
I can guarantee you,

23:49.320 --> 23:51.311
I'm probably gonna be
pissed off at somebody.

23:51.460 --> 23:52.495
I don't know.

23:52.630 --> 23:53.972
Yeah, probably.

23:54.120 --> 23:55.906
[chuckles]

23:56.050 --> 23:59.986
Heck, it might even be you.

24:00.120 --> 24:02.509
But you know the crazy thing is,
is that the anger

24:02.640 --> 24:05.746
that you feel is usually for
the people you love the most.

24:05.890 --> 24:06.959
- Right?
- Yeah.

24:07.100 --> 24:08.954
When Adam and Crosby
were kids,

24:09.100 --> 24:12.024
they used to make me
so angry.

24:12.170 --> 24:14.058
They'd just--running around,
screaming and yelling.

24:14.210 --> 24:15.723
I couldn't get 'em
to shut up.

24:15.860 --> 24:18.420
I mean, it was like
I wanted to kill them.

24:18.560 --> 24:20.278
No, I mean--
and it's not a metaphor.

24:20.420 --> 24:24.459
I really wanted to kill them,
all right?

24:24.600 --> 24:25.692
Mm-hmm.

24:25.840 --> 24:26.909
I mean,
they'd be running around,

24:27.050 --> 24:29.939
they'd be screaming and--

24:30.080 --> 24:33.288
- You all right?
- Oh, my gosh.

24:33.430 --> 24:35.113
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

24:35.260 --> 24:39.776
I just--I just remembered, they
wanted to play with my baseball,

24:39.920 --> 24:41.956
so I hid it from 'em,
and I know where I put it.

24:42.100 --> 24:44.056
- I remember where I put it.
- That scared me, Grandpa.

24:44.200 --> 24:45.644
I had, like, a--

24:45.790 --> 24:46.859
What do you mean,
like, an epiphany?

24:47.000 --> 24:48.308
- An epiphany.
- Yeah.

24:48.450 --> 24:50.441
Grandson, you got
to take me home, okay?

24:50.590 --> 24:52.729
- Okay, let's go.
- That a boy. Thank you.

24:52.870 --> 24:54.963
- You need help?
- Yep, just a little bit.

24:55.110 --> 24:56.793
There we go.
Good, good.

24:58.560 --> 24:59.595
According to my research,

24:59.730 --> 25:03.803
this roll is
from the mid- to late-19805,

25:03.950 --> 25:05.941
which means I will not be in it,
as I was not yet born.

25:06.090 --> 25:07.352
I was.

25:07.500 --> 25:09.730
I was in my 205 then,
traveling all over the world--

25:09.880 --> 25:11.939
just getting started
as a photojournalist.

25:12.090 --> 25:14.081
It's also not likely
that I will see my mom either,

25:14.230 --> 25:16.118
but I will probably see my dad
in his youth.

25:16.270 --> 25:17.601
He thinks this roll is

25:17.750 --> 25:19.547
from the 1987 Berkeley Parents
College Weekend.

25:19.690 --> 25:21.851
'87, huh?
Yeah?

25:22.000 --> 25:25.128
That's the year I got
my first big photo published.

25:25.280 --> 25:26.201
I was in Sri Lanka.

25:26.350 --> 25:28.659
I was covering this--
an unrelated story,

25:28.800 --> 25:31.143
and then a terrorist
bombs a bus depot.

25:31.280 --> 25:32.451
Luclq.

25:32.600 --> 25:33.908
Oh, I remember that clearly.

25:34.040 --> 25:35.519
I was so excited
to get that shot.

25:35.670 --> 25:37.319
It was like, uh--

25:37.460 --> 25:39.041
It was like my whole world
depended on it.

25:39.190 --> 25:40.771
Oh, boy, man.
I was just a kid.

25:40.910 --> 25:42.150
You_ were not a kid
In your 205.

25:42.290 --> 25:43.188
You were an adult.

25:43.330 --> 25:45.912
Well, I thought I was,
that's for sure.

25:46.060 --> 25:48.779
But no.
No, I was a kid.

25:53.820 --> 25:55.196
This is not

25:55.340 --> 25:57.399
from the 1987 Berkeley College
Parents Weekend.

25:57.550 --> 25:59.927
My aunt Sarah
did not go to Berkeley College,

26:00.070 --> 26:01.583
nor did she go to any college
at all.

26:01.730 --> 26:03.311
According to my dad, she made
a series of poor decisions

26:03.450 --> 26:05.202
in her 205.

26:05.350 --> 26:06.965
Yeah, well,
that's what you do, Max.

26:07.110 --> 26:09.931
You just--you make
one dumb choice after another.

26:10.080 --> 26:11.388
You think you know it all.

26:11.530 --> 26:12.906
And, God,
I thought I knew exactly

26:13.050 --> 26:14.449
what I wanted out of life.

26:14.600 --> 26:15.908
Didn't have a clue.

26:16.050 --> 26:18.041
But now--it's weird now.

26:18.190 --> 26:22.126
I just--it's like my life got
a whole bunch more complicated,

26:22.270 --> 26:26.127
but what I want out of it
got a hell of a lot SImpler.

26:26.270 --> 26:27.851
I don't understand
what you're sayIng.

26:28.000 --> 26:30.264
I don't know.
I don't know what she wants.

26:30.410 --> 26:32.549
Don't get me wrong,
I got a list for her too.

26:32.690 --> 26:34.749
Who are we talking about?

26:34.900 --> 26:35.992
Your aunt Sarah.

26:36.140 --> 26:37.619
I could think
of a whole lot of things

26:37.760 --> 26:39.204
that she does that annoy me.

26:39.350 --> 26:40.726
So can I.

26:40.870 --> 26:42.030
Example:
She talks too much.

26:42.180 --> 26:43.408
Yeah, she does.

26:43.560 --> 26:44.902
- She does, right?
- Yeah.

26:45.050 --> 26:46.187
That's a very good point.

26:46.320 --> 26:47.662
[ding]
- Talks a lot.

26:47.810 --> 26:48.902
Far too loud
and far too often.

26:49.050 --> 26:52.110
Yeah.
Yeah, she does.

26:52.260 --> 26:57.015
She does,
but I don't know, somet--

26:57.160 --> 26:58.604
It's just the way
she does it sometimes.

26:58.750 --> 27:01.878
It's--Her voice--
It's part of the silence.

27:02.030 --> 27:04.407
I prefer actual silence
to Aunt Sarah's voice.

27:08.860 --> 27:10.270
[Camille]
This is so amazing.

27:10.420 --> 27:13.059
I can't even believe this.

27:13.210 --> 27:16.839
I wasn't sure that Max was gonna
be able to get anything

27:16.980 --> 27:19.972
at all usable.

27:20.120 --> 27:21.257
Oh, my God.

27:21.390 --> 27:22.493
This is Adam.

27:22.640 --> 27:23.902
[Sarah]
No!

27:24.050 --> 27:25.426
- Yes. God, that...
- Oh, he's so little.

27:25.570 --> 27:27.299
Photograph's
over 40 years old.

27:27.430 --> 27:29.364
- Where did these come from?
- Your dad.

27:29.500 --> 27:32.219
You know, he was so great
at taking pictures.

27:32.370 --> 27:35.123
He was not so great
about getting them developed.

27:35.270 --> 27:35.986
It's amazing.

27:36.130 --> 27:38.018
- Aw.
- Yeah.

27:38.170 --> 27:40.638
Oh, you guys
look so beautiful.

27:40.790 --> 27:42.018
Yeah, you know,
I remember this.

27:42.170 --> 27:44.730
This was
just after I told your dad

27:44.870 --> 27:46.724
that I was pregnant
with Julia.

27:46.870 --> 27:48.656
Oh. He looks a little--

27:48.800 --> 27:50.552
Well, shocked?
Yeah.

27:50.700 --> 27:51.928
Terrified, really.

27:52.080 --> 27:53.968
- No, it was just such a shock.
- Was it?

27:54.120 --> 27:57.044
Yeah, he kept saying, "Four?"

27:57.190 --> 27:58.043
He kept saying it
over and over.

27:58.190 --> 27:59.350
- Like, upset?
- "Four?"

27:59.500 --> 28:01.013
No, he just--
he couldn't believe it.

28:01.160 --> 28:02.297
"We're gonna have four?"

28:02.430 --> 28:06.127
God, he was so excited.

28:06.270 --> 28:08.124
- Hello.
- Is that me?

28:08.270 --> 28:09.362
Yeah, it's you.

28:09.510 --> 28:11.717
I'm surprised
you let me hold you long enough

28:11.860 --> 28:13.339
to have this picture taken.

28:13.480 --> 28:15.823
You were always wriggling
out of my arms and racing away.

28:15.970 --> 28:20.441
Boy, it was so hard
to keep you tied down.

28:20.590 --> 28:23.696
Oh, now I remember this.

28:23.840 --> 28:25.899
- Do you remember this day?
- Mm-mm.

28:26.040 --> 28:27.109
- No?
- Mm-mm.

28:27.250 --> 28:30.560
This was the day
before you left home.

28:30.700 --> 28:32.179
Oh.

28:32.330 --> 28:34.423
Yeah, I remember it, because
I saw you out in the garden,

28:34.570 --> 28:37.778
and you looked so pretty, and I
wanted to paint your portrait,

28:37.920 --> 28:39.012
but you didn't want
to sit for me.

28:39.160 --> 28:41.367
So I had Dad take pictures,

28:41.510 --> 28:45.059
and I was gonna work
from the photographs.

28:45.200 --> 28:47.998
- And then, of course...
- Yeah.

28:48.140 --> 28:50.859
A couple hours later,
we had that huge fight.

28:51.000 --> 28:53.207
- Yeah.
- Next day, you were gone.

28:53.350 --> 28:54.339
I remember that too.

28:54.490 --> 28:57.789
But you came back.

28:59.040 --> 29:00.075
Too many years later.

29:00.220 --> 29:01.482
Yeah, well,

29:01.630 --> 29:04.736
you finally figured out
where you were supposed to be.

29:04.880 --> 29:06.188
That's right.

29:06.330 --> 29:09.493
Thanks, Mom.

29:09.640 --> 29:11.744
What's going on, sweetie?

29:11.880 --> 29:13.984
I feel--

29:14.130 --> 29:16.189
- Hank wants to get married.
- [gaSPSI

29:16.340 --> 29:17.989
I know, but I didn't--
I haven't given him an answer

29:18.130 --> 29:20.166
because I don't know
what I want to do,

29:20.310 --> 29:25.088
and I have this long list
of reasons why not.

29:25.240 --> 29:27.754
Well, there's always a list.

29:27.900 --> 29:29.060
- Is there?
- I had a list.

29:29.210 --> 29:30.620
Thank goodness, I kind of,

29:30.760 --> 29:34.218
you know, ultimately
didn't pay much attention to it.

29:34.350 --> 29:38.286
But there are some things that
maybe I should pay attention to.

29:38.430 --> 29:40.807
- Do you love him?
- Yeah.

29:40.950 --> 29:42.212
Does he make you happy?

29:42.360 --> 29:44.499
[chuckles]

29:44.640 --> 29:45.948
Yeah.

29:46.090 --> 29:49.082
Well, what else is there?

29:52.340 --> 29:53.546
Yeah.

29:58.580 --> 30:01.208
[Adam]
Okay, I think our tea party
is all set.

30:01.350 --> 30:02.863
- Is there anything else?
- Dad, wear this, please.

30:03.000 --> 30:03.796
I have to wear that?

30:03.940 --> 30:05.134
All right.

30:08.870 --> 30:10.667
- How do I look?
- Beautiful.

30:10.800 --> 30:12.802
[slurps]

30:12.940 --> 30:14.009
- Ah, that's delicious tea.
[doorbell chimes]

30:14.150 --> 30:15.287
Do we need to make
some more tea?

30:15.430 --> 30:17.591
Oh, there's somebody
at the door.

30:17.740 --> 30:19.662
Hold on one second.

30:19.810 --> 30:20.845
Jasmine.

30:20.990 --> 30:22.218
- Hey.
- Come on in.

30:22.370 --> 30:24.088
Hope I'm not interrupting.
Is it a bad time?

30:24.230 --> 30:25.879
No, we're just
having a tea party in there,

30:26.030 --> 30:28.339
[British accent] if you want
to have some tea with the queen.

30:28.480 --> 30:29.617
[British accent]
Maybe a little bit later.

30:29.750 --> 30:31.308
Yeah?
You all right?

30:31.450 --> 30:34.442
Um,
can we talkjust a few minutes?

30:34.590 --> 30:35.989
Yeah, sure.

30:36.140 --> 30:37.721
Just let me flip the TV on,
and I'll come back.

30:37.870 --> 30:39.724
- Have a seat.
- Okay.

30:39.870 --> 30:41.838
All right, just gonna flip on
a little TV for you here,

30:41.970 --> 30:44.768
Nora, okay?

30:44.910 --> 30:47.970
[cartoon on TV]

30:49.880 --> 30:51.188
Okay.

30:51.330 --> 30:52.843
Your brother
doesn't know I'm here,

30:52.980 --> 30:54.868
and I would prefer
to keep it that way, okay?

30:55.020 --> 30:56.362
Okay.

30:56.500 --> 30:59.014
He told me
about The Luncheonette,

30:59.160 --> 31:02.027
and I understand.

31:02.170 --> 31:03.125
- Okay, I know that you had...
- Okay, good.

31:03.270 --> 31:05.682
to do what's right
for you and your family.

31:05.820 --> 31:07.139
But I'm here right now

31:07.270 --> 31:08.965
because I have to do
what's right for my family.

31:09.100 --> 31:10.579
Jasmine, I thought
about this, and--

31:10.730 --> 31:11.958
Listen, I know.

31:12.110 --> 31:13.998
I know there's so many reasons
to close,

31:14.140 --> 31:15.767
and they're all
really good reasons.

31:15.900 --> 31:17.140
- I know.
- Okay.

31:17.280 --> 31:19.487
But there's also _a lot
of reasons to keep It open--

31:19.630 --> 31:20.858
more important reasons.

31:21.010 --> 31:22.420
I know it's family,
and it's a dream.

31:22.570 --> 31:24.356
Yeah.

31:24.500 --> 31:25.899
But it just hasn't worked out
the way that we wanted it to,

31:26.050 --> 31:27.153
and I'm not sure
that we can turn it around.

31:27.290 --> 31:28.848
That doesn't mean
you give up though, Adam.

31:28.990 --> 31:30.491
I mean, you guys
started this together,

31:30.640 --> 31:34.360
and The Luncheonette means a lot
to you--to our famIIIes.

31:34.510 --> 31:36.228
Your niece
is about to have a baby.

31:36.370 --> 31:37.268
I know, but I talked to Crosby
about it--I know. I know.

31:37.410 --> 31:38.160
She's gonna have a baby.
She depending on this.

31:38.310 --> 31:39.811
I talked to Crosby,

31:39.960 --> 31:40.858
and it seems like he was
understandIng of my p05ItIon.

31:41.000 --> 31:42.786
He's not understanding
at all.

31:42.930 --> 31:46.866
He's devastated, and I've never
seen him like this before.

31:47.000 --> 31:49.173
I'm worried about him.

31:49.320 --> 31:52.835
I know he needs this,
so I'm just asking you, please,

31:52.980 --> 31:55.005
promise me
you'll reconsider.

31:55.150 --> 31:57.004
That's all.

31:57.150 --> 31:58.594
Just give me some time
to think about it.

31:58.740 --> 32:00.526
Okay.

32:04.060 --> 32:06.528
[sirens in the distance]

32:15.720 --> 32:17.096
- Hey, uh, yeah.
- Hey.

32:17.240 --> 32:20.516
I was told that you and your mom
are assembling a crib,

32:20.660 --> 32:22.207
and I, uh--

32:22.350 --> 32:25.069
I know you're independent,
and you're capable of anything,

32:25.210 --> 32:27.144
but I just thought
it might feel a little safer

32:27.290 --> 32:28.075
if you let me
just take a look at it--

32:28.220 --> 32:29.596
Yes! Oh, God.

32:29.740 --> 32:30.968
Oh, God,
thank you so much for coming.

32:31.120 --> 32:33.111
Yeah.
All right.

32:33.260 --> 32:34.522
Really, this is--

32:34.670 --> 32:36.114
- It'll be all right.
- It's been terrible.

32:36.260 --> 32:38.012
You started already?

32:38.160 --> 32:39.878
- Good.
- It's in here.

32:40.020 --> 32:41.669
You got the receipt, right?

32:46.820 --> 32:48.924
I can't decide
if these are clean or dirty.

32:49.070 --> 32:50.685
And you need more,
by the way.

32:50.830 --> 32:51.990
All right.

32:52.140 --> 32:54.859
Is that the lunch budget?

32:55.000 --> 32:59.243
Luncheonette numbers--I'm just
going over these numbers again.

32:59.390 --> 33:00.618
The Luncheonette?

33:00.770 --> 33:02.658
Yeah, we, you know,
get this insurance money,

33:02.800 --> 33:04.939
and then we've had
this ad jingle company come in,

33:05.080 --> 33:06.968
and if I can get them
to come in more,

33:07.120 --> 33:09.008
I think we could start
to turn a proﬁt, maybe.

33:09.150 --> 33:10.731
Um, why are you--

33:10.880 --> 33:13.019
I thought we were just--I
thought we were done with that.

33:13.160 --> 33:14.559
So why are you looking
at the numbers?

33:14.710 --> 33:17.770
We were done, and then Jasmine
came to talk to me about it.

33:17.920 --> 33:19.194
Jasmine came to talk to you
about it?

33:19.340 --> 33:20.739
Why? For what? What did--

33:20.890 --> 33:24.610
Crosby--about how important
the business is to the family

33:24.760 --> 33:28.230
and just told me that Crosby's
really devastated, and he's--

33:28.380 --> 33:30.063
Well, I know
he's probably really sad.

33:30.210 --> 33:31.279
You're sad. I'm sad.

33:31.420 --> 33:32.648
This is a loss, you know?
But...

33:32.800 --> 33:34.244
It is sad.
I don't know what he's gonna do.

33:34.390 --> 33:36.176
He is a big boy.
He'll get over it.

33:36.320 --> 33:38.834
He'll move on, just like
you're doing--we're doing.

33:38.980 --> 33:40.902
Yeah, I just don't know
if he will get over it.

33:41.050 --> 33:42.768
It just means so much
to him,

33:42.910 --> 33:45.322
and when I look back, Kristina,
if you remember where I was at

33:45.470 --> 33:46.778
when we started The
Luncheonette, I was terrified.

33:46.920 --> 33:48.490
I know. I get it.
But, honey, you ran the numbers.

33:48.640 --> 33:49.811
I don't think
you know how terrified

33:49.950 --> 33:51.326
I was when I lost my job
at TNS.

33:51.470 --> 33:52.778
- Yes, I do. I remember.
- The Luncheonette saved me.

33:52.920 --> 33:54.330
Crosby saved me
at that time,

33:54.480 --> 33:58.712
and now I feel like I should
be there for my brother.

34:00.760 --> 34:03.274
I just--I don't want
his feelings to force you

34:03.420 --> 34:05.445
into a bad decision
financially.

34:05.590 --> 34:06.659
- I just don't.
- Right.

34:06.800 --> 34:07.721
No, you're right.

34:07.870 --> 34:09.588
You know,
you've done for this family.

34:09.730 --> 34:10.412
- You've always been there.
- You're right, it's just--

34:10.560 --> 34:11.720
- It's a tough decision.
- I get it.

34:11.870 --> 34:12.529
I'm trying to do
the right thing, and I just--

34:12.670 --> 34:14.240
I got to get some air
right now.

34:14.390 --> 34:15.311
- Like you always do.
- I got to go take a walk.

34:15.460 --> 34:16.210
Okay, I love you.
You're absolutely right.

34:16.360 --> 34:17.327
You're absolutely right.

34:17.460 --> 34:20.532
I just got to take--
take a minute.

34:23.640 --> 34:25.983
[Sarah]
Amber,
you have to close this door.

34:26.130 --> 34:27.154
- Shh. Shh.
- Oh, hi.

34:27.300 --> 34:28.289
- Yeah, she's out.
- Oh.

34:28.440 --> 34:29.646
She went out
about an hour ago.

34:29.790 --> 34:31.781
Oh, good.

34:31.930 --> 34:33.067
Did you do this?

34:33.200 --> 34:34.781
Yeah, I did it.
I did it. I did it.

34:34.930 --> 34:36.022
You did it?

34:36.170 --> 34:38.923
Yeah, yeah.
Shh, shh, shh.

34:39.070 --> 34:40.241
That's amazing.
How'd you do that?

34:40.380 --> 34:42.177
It took a while.

34:42.320 --> 34:44.902
You need, like, an engineering
degree for one of these things.

34:45.040 --> 34:46.905
Wow.

34:47.050 --> 34:47.903
Yeah.

34:48.050 --> 34:49.699
That's it.

34:49.840 --> 34:51.637
It's not perfect.

34:51.770 --> 34:53.977
If I'm being honest,
I've got one screw left.

34:54.120 --> 34:55.530
- Oh, no.
- Yeah.

34:55.670 --> 34:57.012
Hmm.

34:57.160 --> 34:58.536
I don't think
it's that important,

34:58.680 --> 35:01.012
because it's pretty solid.

35:01.160 --> 35:03.913
He got a good one--Seth.

35:04.060 --> 35:05.994
I didn't think--you know,
I thought he'd go skimpy,

35:06.130 --> 35:09.406
but it's pretty good.

35:09.550 --> 35:10.756
Whew, yeah, she didn't know
what she was doing.

35:10.900 --> 35:13.926
She had it
all over the place.

35:14.070 --> 35:15.173
Hey.

35:19.910 --> 35:22.458
Yes.

35:22.600 --> 35:26.047
What?
Yes, what?

35:26.190 --> 35:29.182
To the question
you asked me.

35:32.160 --> 35:34.196
What are you saying?

35:35.370 --> 35:37.019
- What are you saying?
- [chuckles]

35:37.160 --> 35:37.819
No. Are we getting married?

35:37.960 --> 35:39.052
Mm-hmm.

35:39.200 --> 35:40.610
Are we-- _
We're gonna get marrIed?

35:40.750 --> 35:42.615
Yeah, I'd like to.

35:47.690 --> 35:49.749
Wow. Wow.

35:49.900 --> 35:51.174
[laughs]

35:56.010 --> 35:58.524
[Sydney]
Come on, I'll race you.

35:58.670 --> 35:59.352
[Victor]
Okay, you're gonna--
Okay, we're gonna race.

35:59.500 --> 36:00.250
- We're racing? Oh, wow.
- Okay.

36:00.390 --> 36:01.493
- Go for_ it.
- I got It.

36:01.640 --> 36:02.356
- Show her how it's done.
- Okay.

36:02.500 --> 36:04.946
You got this.

36:07.190 --> 36:09.954
- Great job.
- Oh!

36:10.090 --> 36:13.196
[indistinct chatter]

36:17.690 --> 36:20.682
[mellow alternative music]

36:28.730 --> 36:32.450
[cell phone rings]
- Excuse me.

36:32.600 --> 36:34.454
- Hi.
- HI.

36:34.600 --> 36:38.081
Uh, Ijust wanted to say hi.

36:38.230 --> 36:40.016
[chuckles]
Hi.

36:40.160 --> 36:42.811
And what is that awesome music
you're lIstenIng to?

36:42.950 --> 36:44.190
[laughs]

36:44.340 --> 36:47.673
I am at the skating rink
with the kids.

36:47.820 --> 36:49.128
Oh.

36:49.270 --> 36:50.339
How they doing?

36:50.480 --> 36:53.688
Well,
better than the last lap.

36:53.830 --> 36:55.229
[laughs]

36:55.380 --> 36:57.689
Sydney is trying
to tell Victor, I think,

36:57.830 --> 37:00.207
probably everything that
her coach has ever told her.

37:00.350 --> 37:02.341
That's good.
[chuckles]

37:03.980 --> 37:06.494
Um, I should probably go.

37:06.630 --> 37:08.040
[Joel]
Hey, can you--

37:08.190 --> 37:09.703
Can you just hang on?

37:09.840 --> 37:11.489
- Talk to me for a few minutes.
- Yeah.

37:11.640 --> 37:13.608
What do you want to talk about?

37:13.740 --> 37:15.560
Nothing,
I just want to hear your voice.

37:17.090 --> 37:18.318
So give me the play-by-play.

37:18.470 --> 37:21.121
What are they doing?
What are they doing now?

37:21.270 --> 37:24.854
Well, they're coming
around the corner neck and neck.

37:25.000 --> 37:26.991
Look of determination
on Victor's face.

37:27.140 --> 37:28.448
So awesome.

37:28.590 --> 37:30.308
He's hot on the chase.

37:30.450 --> 37:33.795
Sydney, like a swan,
gliding gracefully--

37:33.940 --> 37:34.861
[laughs]

37:39.870 --> 37:41.599
Oh, that--

37:41.740 --> 37:43.799
You know, sometimes it's good
to take that off the wall

37:43.950 --> 37:45.565
and look at it up close.

37:45.710 --> 37:47.632
That is a handsome portrait
of the two of us, isn't it?

37:47.780 --> 37:49.156
No, don't, don't, don't--

37:49.300 --> 37:50.460
Hey, I don't want
to leave it behind.

37:50.610 --> 37:51.679
I want to keep that.

37:51.820 --> 37:53.151
Oh, we're not gonna
leave it behind.

37:53.300 --> 37:55.097
We got to leave it up there,
because I, my friend,

37:55.230 --> 37:56.333
have changed my mind.

37:56.480 --> 37:58.334
Let's do this.

37:58.480 --> 38:01.199
Let's make The Luncheonette sail
once agaIn.

38:01.340 --> 38:03.615
I'm in.

38:04.520 --> 38:05.589
I'm in.

38:05.730 --> 38:07.300
- Are you serious?
- I'm serious.

38:07.450 --> 38:09.133
You're--'cause I--
it's too much for me to--

38:09.280 --> 38:11.453
Unwavering.
I'm in.

38:11.590 --> 38:12.727
We're gonna make
The Luncheonette work.

38:12.870 --> 38:14.007
- You promise?
- I promise you. Okay?

38:14.150 --> 38:14.969
- Okay.
- You okay?

38:15.120 --> 38:16.451
- Yes.
- You sure?

38:16.600 --> 38:18.909
- Yes. Yes, yes, yes. Thank you.
- All right.

38:19.050 --> 38:20.460
Thank you.

38:20.600 --> 38:22.841
It's gonna work.

38:30.720 --> 38:32.574
Hi.

38:32.720 --> 38:34.164
- Hey, Dad, what--
- Oh, my God.

38:34.310 --> 38:35.447
Hey.

38:35.580 --> 38:37.229
What are you--
What are you doing here?

38:37.380 --> 38:39.166
Look who it is.

38:39.310 --> 38:40.754
I heard there were some major
world-class speed skaters here.

38:40.900 --> 38:41.650
- I wanted to--
- He's getting better.

38:41.800 --> 38:42.960
- Yeah.
- Is he?

38:43.110 --> 38:44.316
- A little bit better.
- Because of me.

38:44.460 --> 38:45.176
- Because of you?
- Dad, Dad, look.

38:45.320 --> 38:46.173
A little better,
she's right.

38:46.320 --> 38:47.139
All right.
Let's see it.

38:47.290 --> 38:49.929
Okay. I'll see you soon.

38:50.080 --> 38:52.219
[The War on Drugs'
Eyes to the Wind]

38:52.360 --> 38:55.215
[upbeat music]

39:03.030 --> 39:06.124
[The War on Drugs]
I was sailing down here
on the wind

39:09.170 --> 39:12.094
When I met you

39:12.240 --> 39:14.583
And I fell away again

39:15.560 --> 39:18.939
Whoa. Look.

39:19.080 --> 39:22.789
Like a train in reverse
down a dark road

39:24.910 --> 39:26.389
Carrying the whole load

39:26.530 --> 39:27.974
Oh, my gosh.

39:28.120 --> 39:31.009
Just rattling
the whole way home

39:31.160 --> 39:32.297
[Zeek]
Millie.

39:32.430 --> 39:33.988
Yeah, I'm in here.

39:34.130 --> 39:35.392
Come and look at these pictures
that Max developed.

39:35.540 --> 39:37.576
No, later, later.
I'm just way too excited.

39:37.720 --> 39:40.951
I remembered what happened
to my Reggie Jackson baseball.

39:41.100 --> 39:42.260
Will you let it
pull you in?

39:42.410 --> 39:43.263
- Oh.
- Yeah.

39:43.410 --> 39:44.923
You remember
Adam and Crosby

39:45.070 --> 39:46.378
used to play with it
all the time,

39:46.520 --> 39:47.964
so I took it,
and I put it in a shoe box,

39:48.100 --> 39:50.443
and I hid it up in the rafters
in the old barn.

39:50.590 --> 39:52.103
So we got to go back
to the old house.

39:52.250 --> 39:53.694
Come on.

39:53.830 --> 39:54.558
Okay.

39:54.700 --> 39:55.485
- Come on.
- [laughs]

39:55.630 --> 39:59.214
Babe

39:59.360 --> 40:01.180
Let me hold you

40:09.440 --> 40:11.294
They painted.

40:11.440 --> 40:12.771
Yeah.

40:12.920 --> 40:14.091
I never would have thought
of that color,

40:14.230 --> 40:15.504
but it looks good.

40:15.650 --> 40:18.198
[children chattering]

40:19.720 --> 40:22.587
[upbeat music]

40:58.170 --> 41:00.343
[both laughing]

41:00.490 --> 41:03.175
Boy, she's got
her hands full.

41:03.320 --> 41:06.073
Yeah, I hope
she's loving every second of it.

41:11.640 --> 41:15.394
So...go knock on the door.

41:15.540 --> 41:16.677
Oh, my God.

41:20.020 --> 41:22.909
- [exhales]
- What?

41:23.060 --> 41:26.120
I changed my mind.

41:26.270 --> 41:27.498
'Cause someday,

41:27.650 --> 41:28.787
those kids are gonna be playing
hide-and-seek

41:28.930 --> 41:30.989
or messing around
in the barn,

41:31.140 --> 41:34.132
and they're gonna find an old
shoe box full of baseball stuff,

41:34.280 --> 41:36.066
and they're gonna--

41:36.210 --> 41:38.929
they're gonna think
they found a hidden treasure.

41:39.080 --> 41:41.594
It's gonna be the best day
of their lives.

41:45.530 --> 41:47.805
Sure.

41:47.950 --> 41:50.009
Yeah.

41:50.160 --> 41:51.673
Yeah, let's go home.
