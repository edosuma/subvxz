17:23.250 --> 17:26.083
And he's had the same driver
for twenty years.

17:27.417 --> 17:30.000
Sounds like a great job,
good pay.

17:31.125 --> 17:32.792
Full benefits package.

17:34.208 --> 17:35.959
So, you interested
in the job, son?

17:36.041 --> 17:37.041
I don't know.

17:37.125 --> 17:38.291
I mean, I--

17:38.375 --> 17:40.500
It's not mine yet.
I still gotta...

17:40.583 --> 17:43.458
go in and do the interview
and all of that.

17:43.542 --> 17:46.041
So, is the interview
at the Dalton Building?

17:46.125 --> 17:48.583
No, it's at his home office.

17:50.625 --> 17:52.625
I'll think about it.

17:57.333 --> 18:01.583
BIG: New game.
Same old rules.

18:01.667 --> 18:05.709
Brand-new game.
Same old shit.

18:06.750 --> 18:07.959
What was that--

18:08.041 --> 18:11.250
the only thing
I remember from school--

18:11.333 --> 18:13.250
"panem et circenses."

18:13.333 --> 18:16.667
Bread and circus.

18:16.750 --> 18:20.291
Keep them fed
and entertained and stupid,

18:20.375 --> 18:24.959
and, that way, you can
keep them where you want them.

18:26.542 --> 18:28.750
You and Big serious?

18:28.834 --> 18:30.542
We together.

18:30.625 --> 18:33.667
You should be with someone
who's got more going on.

18:33.750 --> 18:35.333
What, like you and Gus?

18:35.417 --> 18:38.250
Yeah. Gus has got a future.

18:38.333 --> 18:40.000
Big's cool and all,

18:40.083 --> 18:42.375
but... he's more like
a fixer-upper.

18:42.458 --> 18:46.125
He's a wild card,
and he don't need fixin'.

18:47.208 --> 18:48.917
When they made Big,

18:49.000 --> 18:50.959
they broke the mold.

18:57.959 --> 18:59.917
Hey, y'all know that
up there is me, right?

19:06.417 --> 19:07.917
How you doin'?

19:11.291 --> 19:13.041
Who is that?

19:21.458 --> 19:23.625
Mnh-mnh. White girls
like poodles.

19:23.709 --> 19:25.500
They go to bed with anybody.

19:30.083 --> 19:32.083
Is you gon' look at her
all night?

19:32.166 --> 19:33.083
Mm-mmm.

19:34.500 --> 19:36.542
Shit, I'd rather be
lookin' at you, baby.

19:36.625 --> 19:39.083
Well, you weren't.

19:42.208 --> 19:43.250
Hey...

19:46.625 --> 19:49.125
It's me and you, all right?

19:56.625 --> 19:57.875
BIG: Oh, fuck.

20:06.208 --> 20:08.458
Hey, look,
I'm telling you,

20:08.542 --> 20:11.875
Blum's store is
a cash-only business.

20:11.959 --> 20:15.834
And they got
money in the till
ripe for the taking.

20:18.250 --> 20:20.417
I mean, and it'd give us
a way to prove ourselves.

20:24.041 --> 20:26.041
TONY: We ain't
in high school no more, man.

20:26.125 --> 20:27.709
I mean, shit, I got a son
I gotta take care of

20:27.792 --> 20:29.959
and a job I gotta do,
every day.

20:31.959 --> 20:33.458
JACK: Suit yourself.

20:36.959 --> 20:37.834
Big?

20:40.875 --> 20:42.166
What's Gus say?

20:42.250 --> 20:44.500
Got "A," got "B,"
got "E."

20:44.583 --> 20:46.250
Shit, I got the whole
damn alphabet.

20:47.750 --> 20:50.750
Yeah, I don't know.
I don't think Gus is in.

20:50.834 --> 20:53.625
Yeah, that's 'cause Gus
don't need the opportunity.

20:57.709 --> 21:00.125
Just me, you, Big.

21:03.750 --> 21:05.166
You got it all planned out?

21:05.250 --> 21:08.166
Man, it's like we practically
already done it.

21:09.500 --> 21:13.000
Yeah, home...
I don't know, bro.

21:14.500 --> 21:16.208
Know, it-- it ain't for me.

21:16.291 --> 21:17.417
Yeah.

21:17.500 --> 21:20.291
You don't want
to nothin' authentic.

21:22.000 --> 21:24.625
Instead of looking
and acting like a real brother,

21:24.709 --> 21:27.333
you have to run around
fronting like a fucking clown.

21:29.834 --> 21:33.166
I'll meet you whenever...

21:33.250 --> 21:36.166
and rob whatever.

21:39.208 --> 21:41.000
Name the time and place.

21:42.417 --> 21:46.208
Next Tuesday,
a week from today,

21:46.291 --> 21:48.083
ten in the morning.

21:49.583 --> 21:50.542
Done.

21:57.041 --> 21:59.417
BESSIE: You really gon'
rob that store with Jack?

21:59.500 --> 22:01.250
BIG: I told him I would.

22:05.375 --> 22:06.333
Hey.

22:07.542 --> 22:10.166
You want me
to stay the night?

22:10.250 --> 22:12.208
Maybe tomorrow night.

22:14.333 --> 22:16.792
What about that job offer
from your mom?

22:18.542 --> 22:19.458
What about it?

22:58.959 --> 23:01.583

24:11.166 --> 24:12.625
I'm Peggy, come in.

24:12.709 --> 24:13.667
Thanks.

24:33.417 --> 24:34.917
You'll get used to it.

24:39.542 --> 24:41.291
Wait here.

24:41.375 --> 24:42.333
All right.

24:42.417 --> 24:44.291
You can sit down.

24:44.375 --> 24:45.333
OK.

25:07.583 --> 25:09.625
Great of you
to come by this morning.

25:12.333 --> 25:15.208
- Will Dalton.
- Um, thank you for
having me, sir.

25:15.291 --> 25:18.375
No "sir," just Dalton.

25:18.458 --> 25:20.542
Thank you for having me,
Mr. Dalton.

25:21.709 --> 25:23.041
You can come on this way.

25:23.125 --> 25:24.875
All right.

25:28.917 --> 25:31.875
So, you all been
living here a long time?

25:31.959 --> 25:34.458
WILL: The house has been
in the family for generations.

25:36.333 --> 25:37.375
Is everything OK?

25:37.458 --> 25:39.500
I wanted to meet
our new driver.

25:39.583 --> 25:43.041
Mr. Thomas, meet my beautiful
young wife, Mrs. Dalton.

25:43.125 --> 25:44.834
It's a pleasure.

25:44.917 --> 25:46.917
Did you find
the house all right?

25:50.750 --> 25:53.333
Yeah.
Yes. Yes, ma'am.

25:53.417 --> 25:55.041
You didn't get lost.

25:55.125 --> 25:56.959
Not at all, ma'am.

25:57.041 --> 26:00.000
Marty says you are
a wonderful young man.

26:02.583 --> 26:04.375
Do you enjoy driving?

26:04.458 --> 26:06.959
Very much, ma'am.

26:07.041 --> 26:09.667
Well, it's settled, then.

26:14.542 --> 26:16.208
Let's head into my office.

26:16.291 --> 26:19.208
It's a pleasure
having you in our home.

26:19.291 --> 26:20.667
Nice to meet you.

26:32.583 --> 26:34.667
She hasn't always been blind.

26:39.917 --> 26:40.875
Hmm.

26:40.959 --> 26:42.375
Have a seat.

26:56.166 --> 26:57.333
No computer?

26:57.417 --> 26:58.792
I'm a total Luddite.

26:58.875 --> 27:00.083
I feel that.

27:00.166 --> 27:02.792
I prefer, uh,
cassettes to CDs.

27:02.875 --> 27:04.291
We're on the same page.

27:04.375 --> 27:05.583
Yeah.

27:05.667 --> 27:09.125
- Your resume?
- Yes. Uh...

27:09.208 --> 27:11.792
It's not really...
up to date.

27:11.875 --> 27:13.417
Ah, that's fine.

27:15.583 --> 27:17.166
Marty says you're a good guy.

27:18.834 --> 27:21.083
So, my security guy,

27:21.166 --> 27:25.792
he insists that I do
a thorough background check.

27:25.875 --> 27:27.709
OK.

27:39.709 --> 27:40.667
Clean record.

27:44.208 --> 27:45.417
Well, yeah.

27:47.083 --> 27:48.375
You're a good driver?

27:48.458 --> 27:49.959
The best.

27:50.041 --> 27:51.917
I-I've never even
run a red light.

27:53.041 --> 27:54.583
That's what they say.

28:02.458 --> 28:03.875
Your first name is Bigger.

28:03.959 --> 28:07.000
Yeah. Uh,
my friends call me Big.

28:07.083 --> 28:10.333
- Not Biggie?
- After Biggie Smalls? Nah.

28:10.417 --> 28:14.333
Good, seeing how
Christopher Wallace
came to a difficult end.

28:17.917 --> 28:20.041
Are you nearsighted
or farsighted?

28:20.125 --> 28:24.667
I wear them for driving,
but, uh, they're not strong.

28:24.750 --> 28:27.458
They're just to...
make things...

28:27.542 --> 28:29.250
Clearer. Right.

28:30.917 --> 28:32.125
Right.

28:39.375 --> 28:40.625
No, sit down.

28:46.500 --> 28:51.125
So, you'll have a room
here, on the top floor
of the house.

28:51.208 --> 28:53.542
You'll have your meals
here too, of course.

28:53.625 --> 28:54.709
Right.

28:54.792 --> 28:56.917
You'll make a thousand
dollars a week.

28:57.959 --> 28:59.291
You got any questions
so far?

28:59.375 --> 29:00.959
None at all.

29:02.625 --> 29:04.625
I'm usually at the office
by eight a.m.

29:04.709 --> 29:07.667
Then you'll be on duty
to take Miss Dalton,
our daughter,

29:07.750 --> 29:08.917
to the university.

29:09.000 --> 29:10.667
Her class schedule,
it varies.

29:10.750 --> 29:13.750
But during the day,
should Mrs. Dalton
want to go out,

29:13.834 --> 29:15.250
you'll take her.

29:15.333 --> 29:16.625
Think you can handle
all that?

29:16.709 --> 29:17.667
Yeah.

29:20.125 --> 29:21.792
One question:

29:21.875 --> 29:24.208
You guys want me
to cut my hair?

29:24.291 --> 29:26.875
It's fine just as it is.

29:28.208 --> 29:29.417
Is that good?

29:29.500 --> 29:31.125
Yeah.

29:32.166 --> 29:34.166
Job is yours, Bigger.

29:35.834 --> 29:36.750
Great.

29:36.834 --> 29:39.125
Mr. Greene,
our last driver,

29:39.208 --> 29:41.041
he did very well here.

29:41.125 --> 29:43.000
We hope you will too.

29:43.083 --> 29:44.917
I plan to.

29:45.000 --> 29:46.417
MARY: Dad?

29:46.500 --> 29:48.083
Mom said you were
interviewing.

29:48.166 --> 29:49.333
I already hired him.

29:49.417 --> 29:51.250
Bigger Thomas,

29:51.333 --> 29:52.750
this is my daughter Mary.

29:52.834 --> 29:53.834
Hi.

29:53.917 --> 29:55.000
Hey.

29:56.041 --> 29:58.959
I think
I saw you on the news.

29:59.041 --> 30:00.291
What?

30:00.375 --> 30:03.000
( giggles ) It's for
the kids charity event, Dad.

30:03.083 --> 30:04.166
- Alex.
- OK.

30:06.917 --> 30:10.333
Last year, I, um,
made page six

30:10.417 --> 30:13.542
when I took my boyfriend
Jan to Havana.

30:13.625 --> 30:15.458
WILL: We were worried.

30:15.542 --> 30:17.542
But it was all good
in the end, right?

30:17.625 --> 30:20.542
Yeah, you could
say that.

30:22.083 --> 30:23.333
WILL: Let's go
find Peggy.

30:23.417 --> 30:24.375
Cool.

30:25.959 --> 30:28.625
So, uh, your name
is Bigger?

30:28.709 --> 30:30.583
Uh, yeah, yeah.

30:30.667 --> 30:32.333
My friends call me Big.

30:32.417 --> 30:34.000
Your hair is rad.

30:34.083 --> 30:36.125
Thanks.

30:36.208 --> 30:39.583
Do you ever go to,
um, Animal?

30:39.667 --> 30:42.375
Um, yeah, yeah,
sometimes.

30:42.458 --> 30:46.083
So crazy, all the political
stuff that's going on
these days, right?

30:46.166 --> 30:48.291
WILL: Mary,
I don't think Bigger

30:48.375 --> 30:49.667
wants to talk about--

30:49.750 --> 30:51.291
Sure he does.

30:51.375 --> 30:54.125
Dad hates it when I talk
about Occupy

30:54.208 --> 30:55.750
or the Peoples Movement,

30:55.834 --> 30:58.917
but, I mean, you probably
march, right?

30:59.000 --> 31:00.542
Well...

31:00.625 --> 31:01.875
MARY: I hear you,
I hear you.

31:01.959 --> 31:03.333
Folks work
a nine-to-five job

31:03.417 --> 31:06.166
don't really have time
to be at all the rallies.

31:06.250 --> 31:07.875
But you're outraged,
aren't you?

31:09.000 --> 31:10.208
Yeah.

31:10.291 --> 31:11.709
Sure.

31:12.875 --> 31:14.083
See, Dad?

31:14.166 --> 31:15.542
He's outraged.

31:15.625 --> 31:18.542
Unlike you because you're
a damn capitalist.

31:18.625 --> 31:22.542
- You're outraged,
as you should be.

31:22.625 --> 31:25.709
I'm just happy
to have this job.

31:25.792 --> 31:29.041
I, uh,
I have class tonight.

31:29.125 --> 31:30.458
You gonna take me?

31:30.542 --> 31:33.041
We haven't worked out
his start date yet.

31:33.125 --> 31:35.500
Let him start tonight.

31:35.583 --> 31:38.792
Yeah, I can-- I can--
I can start tonight.

31:38.875 --> 31:40.333
Is that cool?

31:40.417 --> 31:42.125
Yeah, that's--
that's fine.

31:42.208 --> 31:43.542
Cool. OK.

31:43.625 --> 31:45.000
- Bye.
- Love you.

31:45.083 --> 31:46.166
- You too.
- See you.

31:46.250 --> 31:47.458
It's nice--

31:49.166 --> 31:53.333
For years,
we have been staunch
supporters of the NAACP.

31:53.417 --> 31:56.375
Mary, instead
of pointing out
the good I'm doing,

31:56.458 --> 31:59.500
delights in pointing out
my faults.

32:02.041 --> 32:04.625
Well, I think you're doing
a pretty good job, sir.

32:04.709 --> 32:06.792
I appreciate you saying that.

32:08.333 --> 32:10.208
PEGGY: This is your room.

32:13.000 --> 32:14.000
BIG: OK.

32:14.083 --> 32:16.375
PEGGY: Look, you get
southern exposure,

32:16.458 --> 32:19.750
so it will always be
nice and bright.

32:19.834 --> 32:21.417
We're changing the sheets
once a week.

32:21.500 --> 32:23.667
- OK.
- And you've got Wi-Fi.

32:23.750 --> 32:24.917
Great.

32:25.000 --> 32:27.667
You and I will always use
these back stairs here

32:27.750 --> 32:31.208
so that they can
have their privacy, and,
quite frankly, so can we.

32:31.291 --> 32:32.625
Cool.

32:32.709 --> 32:34.750
You know, after you've
been working here for a while,

32:34.834 --> 32:36.667
you might have a lady friend

32:36.750 --> 32:38.917
whom you'd like to invite
over sometime.

32:40.417 --> 32:42.792
I think a place like this
needs security cameras,

32:42.875 --> 32:44.709
but Mr. Dalton thinks

32:44.792 --> 32:49.333
heightened security
means heightened crime.

32:49.417 --> 32:50.667
So, this is the furnace.

32:50.750 --> 32:53.375
You'll be in charge
of loading this monster.

32:53.458 --> 32:56.667
It heats the house
adequately, but it's
a clunky old thing.

32:56.750 --> 32:58.333
Still takes coal.

32:58.417 --> 33:01.625
I tell Mr. Dalton,
let's get something
more green, but...

33:01.709 --> 33:04.208
maybe you'll be able
to convince him.

33:04.291 --> 33:08.166
Until then, you'll be
loading this dinosaur

33:08.250 --> 33:09.667
twice a day,

33:09.750 --> 33:11.959
and each night
before you go to bed,

33:12.041 --> 33:14.750
you have
to clean out the ashes.

33:16.542 --> 33:17.542
All clear?

33:17.625 --> 33:18.709
All right.

33:20.166 --> 33:21.709
Good.

33:33.041 --> 33:34.625
Can I touch your hair?

33:36.709 --> 33:38.041
I'm kidding.

33:43.875 --> 33:45.166
Wanna turn the radio on?

33:45.250 --> 33:46.417
Sure.

33:48.291 --> 33:49.750
Shit.

34:06.500 --> 34:08.250
You like this music?

34:09.834 --> 34:12.417
Yeah, it's--
it's cool.

34:13.625 --> 34:15.709
What do you listen to?

34:15.792 --> 34:19.834
Well, if you
really want to know,

34:19.917 --> 34:23.041
sometimes, uh...

34:23.125 --> 34:24.041
this.

34:28.083 --> 34:31.250
It's pretty cool.

34:31.333 --> 34:32.875
Then, uh...

34:32.959 --> 34:35.917
sometimes
I look for this.

34:39.125 --> 34:40.208
OK.

34:40.291 --> 34:42.458
It's all perspective.

34:43.458 --> 34:46.291
Well, rest assured,

34:46.375 --> 34:49.792
you and my dad are gonna
get along just great.

35:09.834 --> 35:12.417
I thought you were
going to class?

35:12.500 --> 35:14.208
Just meeting some friends.

35:14.291 --> 35:15.834
You wanna come in?

35:15.917 --> 35:18.625
Nah, I'm good. I think
I should probably stay
with the car.

35:18.709 --> 35:20.458
No, you should come in,

35:20.542 --> 35:23.333
but, um... I get it.

35:23.417 --> 35:25.375
OK. Stay warm.

35:25.458 --> 35:26.375
All right.

36:10.417 --> 36:11.333
WOMAN: Bye.

36:11.417 --> 36:13.250
MARY: See ya.

36:13.333 --> 36:14.959
JAN: Big?

36:16.083 --> 36:17.250
Hey.

36:19.417 --> 36:20.417
You're Jan.

36:21.500 --> 36:22.875
How'd you know?

36:22.959 --> 36:24.750
Stuff I read online.

36:26.041 --> 36:28.417
Don't believe everything
you read about Jan.

36:28.500 --> 36:31.208
There's a lot of
fake news out there.

36:31.291 --> 36:33.125
Hey, can I drive?

36:33.208 --> 36:35.208
Aw, don't
worry about it,
Big, it's cool.

36:41.667 --> 36:43.417
JAN: Cool.
Everybody in?

36:43.500 --> 36:46.458
Where should we go?

36:46.542 --> 36:48.750
I'm starving.
Are you hungry, Big?

36:50.083 --> 36:52.083
Uh, I'm all right.

36:52.166 --> 36:54.959
Yo, how 'bout a place
in your neighborhood, Big?

36:56.208 --> 36:57.792
You know...

36:57.875 --> 37:00.125
where you can get
some real food.

37:01.166 --> 37:03.166
MARY: What about B and G's?

37:03.250 --> 37:04.417
Let's go to B and G's, yeah?

37:04.500 --> 37:06.333
JAN: Sounds good.

37:06.417 --> 37:09.417
I don't... I don't think y'all
want to go to B and G's.

37:09.500 --> 37:12.291
It's on Juneway Terrace
and Howard.

37:13.834 --> 37:15.583
Hey, maybe Big
doesn't want to go.

37:15.667 --> 37:17.667
It'll be fun.

37:17.750 --> 37:20.458
Come on, guys,
it'll be my treat.

37:25.625 --> 37:27.375
All right, let's...

37:27.458 --> 37:29.417
let's go to B and G's.

37:29.500 --> 37:31.291
JAN: All right.

37:32.709 --> 37:34.000
Let's go.

37:55.333 --> 37:56.500
MARY: Thank you.

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
JAN: Uh, can we get
a bottle of vodka?

38:05.625 --> 38:07.125
JAN: Thank you.

38:09.166 --> 38:11.417
Yo, why is Big with them?

38:11.500 --> 38:12.417
I don't know.

38:12.500 --> 38:14.291
He's supposed to be at work.

38:14.375 --> 38:15.333
Hmm.

38:15.417 --> 38:17.375
It don't look like
he at work.

38:19.333 --> 38:20.834
This place is nice.

38:20.917 --> 38:21.875
Mm-hmm.

38:24.875 --> 38:26.917
Hey, Big.

38:27.000 --> 38:28.500
Hey, Lily.

38:31.291 --> 38:34.959
Look, I'm sure
he ain't with her,
a'ight? He's with them.

38:35.041 --> 38:38.667
If he's working,
then why is he
sitting with them?

38:38.750 --> 38:40.166
I don't know.

38:43.375 --> 38:44.375
JASMINE: Bess.

38:44.458 --> 38:46.166
BESSIE: I'm-a be cool.

38:46.250 --> 38:47.375
JASMINE: A'ight.

38:55.208 --> 38:56.500
Hey.

38:56.583 --> 38:58.750
I thought you was at work.

39:00.625 --> 39:01.792
I am.

39:05.750 --> 39:07.375
Um, I'm Jan.

39:07.458 --> 39:09.542
I'm Mary. Hi.

39:10.667 --> 39:12.250
Nice job.

39:12.333 --> 39:14.750
Yeah, it's all right.

39:14.834 --> 39:17.959
I didn't catch your name.
Sorry, what's your name?

39:18.041 --> 39:19.583
Uh, this is Bessie.

39:19.667 --> 39:23.000
Bessie, if you want
to sit down, there's
plenty of room.

39:23.083 --> 39:26.250
No. I'm already
sitting over there.

39:26.333 --> 39:28.250
I'll go back to my place.

39:32.083 --> 39:34.875
Hey, you wanna--
you wanna meet up later?

39:48.041 --> 39:49.166
You want one?

39:52.291 --> 39:53.750
Yeah, all right.

39:57.333 --> 39:59.583
JAN:
That your girlfriend?

39:59.667 --> 40:01.125
Yep.

40:03.041 --> 40:05.959
Jan and I are, um,
engaged.

40:07.917 --> 40:09.166
But please don't
tell my dad

40:09.250 --> 40:11.125
because he'll
lose his mind.

40:12.709 --> 40:14.458
Your dad seems all right.

40:14.542 --> 40:16.375
Yeah...

40:16.458 --> 40:18.208
if you like One-Percenters.

40:18.291 --> 40:20.959
It's all the same shit
to me.

40:23.417 --> 40:25.166
I grew up in Los Angeles--

40:25.250 --> 40:28.375
well, outside of Los Angeles.

40:28.458 --> 40:30.750
My, uh, folks split up.

40:30.834 --> 40:33.834
Me and my mom, we, uh...

40:35.000 --> 40:36.000
scraped by.

40:52.583 --> 40:55.709
My dad, he was
an accountant, you know?

40:57.125 --> 40:58.667
One day he just...

41:00.083 --> 41:02.875
dropped dead.

41:02.959 --> 41:03.875
Uh...

41:06.875 --> 41:08.667
So sorry.

41:12.709 --> 41:14.333
No, it's all good.

41:17.750 --> 41:19.083
How long?

41:21.417 --> 41:24.875
'Bout six or seven
years ago.

41:31.375 --> 41:35.083
I live in such
an "affluenza" bubble,

41:35.166 --> 41:36.166
and...

41:38.834 --> 41:40.542
I've no idea...

41:41.959 --> 41:45.291
about what, like,
black people actually think

41:45.375 --> 41:47.583
about what's going on
in the world right now.

41:48.875 --> 41:50.375
Well, I'll be sure
to mention that

41:50.458 --> 41:53.667
at our next black meeting.

42:24.834 --> 42:26.792
- JAN: Good night.
- MARY: Good night.

42:30.125 --> 42:32.083
BIG: Let me
ask you a question.

42:32.166 --> 42:33.125
MARY: Mmm?

42:34.625 --> 42:38.667
The driver before me,
Greene,

42:38.750 --> 42:42.083
he used to take you
wherever you wanted to go, huh?

42:42.166 --> 42:45.417
Mnh-mnh.

42:45.500 --> 42:47.542
No, he was, uh,

42:47.625 --> 42:50.125
straight as an arrow,
super square,

42:50.208 --> 42:51.333
no fun ever.

42:54.667 --> 42:56.792
No, he was all right,
though. He, um...

42:58.041 --> 42:59.041
He went to night school,

42:59.125 --> 43:02.458
he got his degree
in business.

43:04.375 --> 43:06.917
Moving on up.

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
My parents are
very proud of him.

43:42.083 --> 43:44.875
MARY: That's a lot of stairs.

43:50.208 --> 43:51.375
Help me.

43:55.041 --> 43:56.709
You can make it up.

44:40.291 --> 44:42.750
MARY: Here's the thing, Mom--
I'm fine to go to church,

44:42.834 --> 44:45.166
so long as you can
recognize that

44:45.250 --> 44:47.000
religion is the opiate
of the masses.

44:47.083 --> 44:48.125
OK.

44:48.208 --> 44:50.583
I think it is lovely

44:50.667 --> 44:52.542
that we are attending church

44:52.625 --> 44:53.917
and giving thanks.

44:54.000 --> 44:57.166
MARY: It is, it is,
it's lovely.

44:57.250 --> 44:59.792
Thank you.
Thank you, Jesus.

45:56.333 --> 45:58.250
WILL: I could use
a week of rain,

45:58.333 --> 46:00.750
just listening to you read.

46:00.834 --> 46:03.917
You're gonna read me
another chapter, aren't you?

46:04.000 --> 46:05.000
MRS. DALTON: Mmm...

46:07.834 --> 46:11.583
"I looked at him eagerly
when he looked at me,

46:11.667 --> 46:17.000
and slightly moved my hands
and shook my head.

46:17.083 --> 46:20.000
I had been waiting for him
to see me,

46:20.083 --> 46:24.709
that I might try to assure him
of my innocence.

46:26.041 --> 46:28.417
It was not at all
expressed to me

46:28.500 --> 46:32.959
that he even comprehended
my intention,

46:33.041 --> 46:39.125
for he gave me a look
that I did not understand,

46:39.208 --> 46:41.542
and it all passed

46:41.625 --> 46:44.750
in a moment."

46:47.166 --> 46:48.959
So fantastic.

47:34.792 --> 47:38.041
( symphonic music plays
on radio )

47:38.125 --> 47:39.875
I love Beethoven.

47:39.959 --> 47:41.959
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I love him too.

47:42.041 --> 47:43.750
All right.

47:46.500 --> 47:50.333
WILL: So, you can
borrow the car
anytime you like.

47:50.417 --> 47:51.583
BIG: Yeah?

47:51.667 --> 47:53.333
WILL: Take your
girl out for a spin,

47:53.417 --> 47:54.291
or something.

47:54.375 --> 47:56.250
BIG: Yeah, uh, maybe.

48:02.667 --> 48:04.291

and chatter )

48:41.333 --> 48:43.792
JACK: Hey, babe,
bring me water.

48:53.875 --> 48:55.875
I didn't do the job
because you didn't show.

48:58.000 --> 49:01.000
Nigga, don't be casting
your fucking anxieties on me.

49:01.083 --> 49:03.333
Got yourself a new job

49:03.417 --> 49:05.542
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Don't go there, big dawg.

49:05.625 --> 49:07.041
I'll go wherever
the fuck I want.

49:07.125 --> 49:08.417
Better watch yourself.

49:08.500 --> 49:09.875
Big'll put you
out on the street,

49:09.959 --> 49:11.625

49:12.834 --> 49:15.000
Ha ha ha ha.

49:15.083 --> 49:16.583
Nigga ain't interested
in a real job.

49:16.667 --> 49:18.375
He's too busy working
for the white folk.

49:20.250 --> 49:21.208
Yeah.

49:21.291 --> 49:23.583
You a house nigger now.

49:24.875 --> 49:26.291
Hey, fuck you, nigga.

No, fuck you.

He never even
really was one.

49:38.208 --> 49:41.583
Yeah, you a lame-ass
pussy Oreo for damn sure.

50:12.083 --> 50:13.041
Fuck!

Yo, Big, come on!

50:14.083 --> 50:15.667
Come on, Big,

50:15.750 --> 50:16.834
What the fuck, man?

50:16.917 --> 50:18.417

- No, no, no, no, no.

50:25.166 --> 50:27.750
You hit me?
Get the fuck off me!

50:27.834 --> 50:30.625
Look at me, baby,
look at me, look at me.

50:30.709 --> 50:31.583
Hey.

51:12.667 --> 51:15.041
My name is Greene.

51:15.125 --> 51:17.000
You must be Bigger.

51:17.083 --> 51:18.000
Yeah.

51:23.125 --> 51:27.250
So, what, you here to
take your old job back?

51:28.625 --> 51:31.750
No, young man,
I'm happy where I'm at.

51:31.834 --> 51:35.000
Mr. Dalton says
you workin' out all right.

51:36.166 --> 51:37.166
I am.

51:37.250 --> 51:39.583
Still got both your
feet on the ground?

51:39.667 --> 51:42.375
Shit, you see me
standing here?

51:42.458 --> 51:44.834
Good man.
Keep standing.

51:46.000 --> 51:47.458
You know,

51:47.542 --> 51:50.750
you and me came up
in the same hood.

51:50.834 --> 51:54.166
I'm guessing that
you had your share of
troubles like I had.

51:54.250 --> 51:55.834
You don't know...

51:55.917 --> 51:57.667
nothing about me, man.

52:04.750 --> 52:07.125
Just, you know...

52:07.208 --> 52:09.542
try to keep both feet
on the good foot.

52:12.542 --> 52:14.542
What is that
supposed to mean?

52:16.458 --> 52:18.500
I know you don't
know me from Adam,

52:18.583 --> 52:21.792
but I'm just here to give you
some friendly advice.

52:23.250 --> 52:26.959
Mr. Dalton's
giving you a chance.

52:27.041 --> 52:29.208
Make something of it,
OK?

52:47.166 --> 52:49.000
Aren't you cold?

52:50.083 --> 52:51.250
A little.

52:58.125 --> 53:00.750
I don't know
about Mary, man.

53:00.834 --> 53:02.458
She seem a little crazy.

53:05.208 --> 53:06.583
Probably.

53:13.417 --> 53:15.166
Mm-mmm.

53:15.250 --> 53:16.125
Mm.

53:17.417 --> 53:19.125
What? What? Really?

53:19.208 --> 53:20.542
Yeah.

53:20.625 --> 53:22.041
Come on, get up.

53:23.250 --> 53:24.667
Get up, baby.

53:27.000 --> 53:28.333
- What?
- Come on.

53:28.417 --> 53:30.542
- Unh-unh, what you
trying to do?
- Huh?

53:31.834 --> 53:32.834
BIG: Why you playing?

53:32.917 --> 53:35.375
Girl...

53:35.458 --> 53:38.959
JAN: Your friend
have anything more
interesting than weed?

53:39.041 --> 53:40.458
You know, like...

53:42.000 --> 53:43.959
I don't know,
something stronger?

53:46.041 --> 53:48.291
MARY: So you're studying
business management?

53:50.125 --> 53:52.250
That's not boring.
It's smart.

53:52.333 --> 53:54.291
Yeah, it feels boring.

53:55.917 --> 53:57.417
Well...

53:57.500 --> 54:00.417
it's totally marketable,
which is great.

54:05.125 --> 54:06.709
MARY: Beethoven?

54:06.792 --> 54:08.208
Ninth Symphony?

54:08.291 --> 54:10.500
Yeah, that's a good one.

54:10.583 --> 54:12.625
Well, you should come.

54:17.166 --> 54:18.125
Mmm...

54:18.208 --> 54:19.709
What, you gon' go?

54:19.792 --> 54:21.709
My parents are
season subscribers,

54:21.792 --> 54:23.583
so they always get
two pairs of tickets,

54:23.667 --> 54:25.083
but they never use 'em.

54:25.166 --> 54:26.709
They'd love it, really.
I mean, we-we should go.

54:26.792 --> 54:27.917
JAN: See you, Jules.

54:28.000 --> 54:30.041
I got exams this week.

54:30.125 --> 54:31.792
All right.

54:31.875 --> 54:33.750
Well, you think about it.

54:33.834 --> 54:35.625
- BIG: I will.

54:40.375 --> 54:42.667
So, where do you spend
your summer, Big?

54:43.667 --> 54:47.333
I, uh, summer where I winter.

54:50.542 --> 54:52.709
Not everybody goes away
for the summer, babe.

54:54.875 --> 54:56.041
I didn't want to assume.

54:57.583 --> 54:59.250
I mean, that's worse, right?

55:02.125 --> 55:04.041
Sorry.

55:04.125 --> 55:06.166
You'll get used to us.

55:12.750 --> 55:14.208
JAN: I should probably...

55:24.709 --> 55:26.166
GEORGE: Good evening,
Miss Dalton.

55:26.250 --> 55:28.375
Hi, George.
Sorry we're late.

55:37.959 --> 55:41.417
( "Ode to Joy" from Beethoven's
Ninth Symphony plays )

55:46.083 --> 55:48.333
BIG: Beethoven's
Ninth Symphony.

55:48.417 --> 55:50.458
A blockbuster.

55:50.542 --> 55:53.625
A true fucking masterpiece.

55:55.375 --> 55:58.917
"I don't want to know anything
about your system of ethics.

56:00.709 --> 56:02.166
Strength is the morality

56:02.250 --> 56:04.959
of the man who
stands out from the rest...

56:07.792 --> 56:09.417
and it is mine."

56:29.000 --> 56:31.959
( Beethoven's Ninth Symphony
concludes )

57:04.083 --> 57:05.542
"...with love."

57:09.166 --> 57:11.834
MARY: Why do they
call it Molly?

57:15.291 --> 57:17.458
BIG: Enjoy yourselves.

57:26.333 --> 57:28.583
JAN: ...it's going
to come from you.

57:28.667 --> 57:32.417
That's how it has to happen,
if it happens at all.

57:32.500 --> 57:35.834
But if it does happen, it's
going to come from you, right?

57:35.917 --> 57:37.583
Like, you have the power.

57:37.667 --> 57:39.750
You guys have the crux.

57:39.834 --> 57:43.959
Our generation has
the power to change things.

58:09.375 --> 58:11.166
I should go.

58:13.291 --> 58:15.333
I got work in the morning.

58:17.959 --> 58:19.709
Damn, though.

58:21.875 --> 58:24.125
Damn, you know
I can't wait.

58:27.792 --> 58:28.750
I know.

58:30.917 --> 58:32.750
I'll text you
when I get home.

58:39.917 --> 58:42.125
I love you.

58:42.208 --> 58:43.583
I love you.

58:47.959 --> 58:49.583
I love you too.

59:23.959 --> 59:26.000
- What the fuck!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

59:26.083 --> 59:28.041
It's OK, it's OK,
it's OK, it's OK, it's OK.

59:28.125 --> 59:29.041
What do you mean it's OK?

59:29.125 --> 59:31.041
No, get the fuck off!

59:31.125 --> 59:32.458
MARY: Jesus!

59:34.000 --> 59:35.875
BIG: Are you OK?

59:35.959 --> 59:37.250
Look, I'm sorry.

59:37.333 --> 59:39.458
Are you fucking kidding me?

59:41.834 --> 59:45.750
You know what?
Fuck this!

59:45.834 --> 59:48.000
Big, can you get her home?

1:00:05.417 --> 1:00:07.542
Um...

1:00:09.291 --> 1:00:11.000
Thank you for the "E."

1:00:12.041 --> 1:00:13.083
It was an ounce.

1:00:13.166 --> 1:00:15.500
Please just take it.

1:00:16.583 --> 1:00:17.500
Please?

1:00:18.834 --> 1:00:20.291
Thank you.

1:00:23.709 --> 1:00:27.667
Yeah, well, thank you
for the record.

1:00:29.667 --> 1:00:31.375
That shit was rad.

1:00:34.417 --> 1:00:37.291
Thank you for coming
to my rescue at the party.

1:00:37.375 --> 1:00:38.542
No sweat.

1:00:38.625 --> 1:00:40.333
Meant a lot to me.

1:00:52.375 --> 1:00:54.000
Oh, God.

1:01:03.291 --> 1:01:04.500
I feel weird.

1:01:04.583 --> 1:01:08.291
You want me to pull over?

1:01:08.375 --> 1:01:09.250
Mnh-mnh.

1:01:13.625 --> 1:01:15.083
I sorry.

1:01:15.166 --> 1:01:18.083
- All right.
- For something weird.

1:01:50.500 --> 1:01:52.041
Fuck.

1:01:55.250 --> 1:01:58.875
♪ Merrily, merrily,
merrily, merrily ♪

1:01:58.959 --> 1:02:02.041
♪ Life is but a dream ♪

1:02:02.125 --> 1:02:05.375
Hey, hey, hey!
Hey! Come here.

1:02:05.458 --> 1:02:09.458
- Hey, hey-- Come on!

1:02:09.542 --> 1:02:12.625
- Hey, come on!

1:02:18.458 --> 1:02:19.625
BIG: Shh.

1:02:19.709 --> 1:02:22.083
- Thank you so much.
- Yeah, of course.

1:02:22.166 --> 1:02:24.375
But you gotta be
really quiet, OK?

1:02:24.458 --> 1:02:25.583
MARY: Yeah.

1:02:35.667 --> 1:02:37.333
MARY: OK.

1:02:39.875 --> 1:02:43.083
- All right, girl.
- "All right, girl."

1:02:43.166 --> 1:02:45.083
All right. You good?

1:02:45.166 --> 1:02:46.291
Yep.

1:02:46.375 --> 1:02:48.959
All right,
but you gotta be quiet.

1:02:49.041 --> 1:02:51.333
- Shh. OK?
- You shh!

1:02:55.583 --> 1:02:58.917
( mumbling ) Yeah--

1:02:59.000 --> 1:03:01.375
- OK. All right.
- Hey!

1:03:01.458 --> 1:03:07.291
- Hey.
- I love... everything.

1:03:07.375 --> 1:03:11.041
- That's the point, OK?
- Hey.

1:03:11.125 --> 1:03:14.959
- OK. I need you to have a seat.
- No.

1:03:15.041 --> 1:03:16.458
I love you.

1:03:16.542 --> 1:03:20.166
- Right.
- No! Hey.

1:03:20.250 --> 1:03:21.917
I mean it. I really love you.

1:03:22.000 --> 1:03:24.959
OK. All right.
I think you're
really, really high.

1:03:25.041 --> 1:03:27.500
- Hey.
- You gotta lay down for me.

1:03:27.583 --> 1:03:30.542
- All right?
- Thank you for the great drugs.

1:03:32.667 --> 1:03:37.291
OK.

1:03:37.375 --> 1:03:39.583
- Hey. You gotta stop.
- Mm-hmm?

1:03:39.667 --> 1:03:41.834
You're gonna
get me fired, all right?

1:03:46.875 --> 1:03:49.250
- OK, now you gotta lay--
- Do you wanna have a thing?

1:03:51.291 --> 1:03:53.917
- We could have a little thing.
- No.

1:03:54.000 --> 1:03:55.291
We could have a big thing.

1:03:55.375 --> 1:03:57.375
No, no, no. Don't. Shh.

1:03:59.041 --> 1:04:02.125
Lay down for me, all right?

1:04:02.208 --> 1:04:05.291
- OK? I don't wanna get fired.
- OK, OK, OK, OK.

1:04:05.375 --> 1:04:06.583
You're gonna get me fired.

1:04:06.667 --> 1:04:09.125
If I lay down for you,

1:04:09.208 --> 1:04:11.000
will you lay down with me?

1:04:11.083 --> 1:04:12.709
You gonna make me lose my job.

1:04:12.792 --> 1:04:15.834
- You're very handsome.
- Stop it.

1:04:15.917 --> 1:04:18.000
You're so handsome.

1:04:18.083 --> 1:04:21.583
I mean it.
You're really handsome.

1:04:21.667 --> 1:04:23.500
- MRS. DALTON: Mary?

1:04:23.583 --> 1:04:28.417
- I don't want you to--
- Shh!

1:04:28.500 --> 1:04:32.125
- I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
- All right, all right.

1:04:32.208 --> 1:04:33.834
Mary, are you here?

1:04:33.917 --> 1:04:36.083
- Shh!
- That's my mom.

1:04:36.166 --> 1:04:37.917
- MRS. DALTON: Are you home?
- Shh!

1:04:39.625 --> 1:04:42.333
Mom?

1:04:46.125 --> 1:04:47.583
MRS. DALTON:
Mary, are you there?

1:04:47.667 --> 1:04:49.000
Mm-hmm.

1:05:02.291 --> 1:05:03.667
- Shh!

1:05:03.750 --> 1:05:04.834
MRS. DALTON:
What's that, dear?

1:05:35.917 --> 1:05:37.709
Mary?

1:06:04.125 --> 1:06:09.375
Hey. Hey, hey!

1:06:09.458 --> 1:06:13.333
Hey! Mary stop playing!
Come on!

1:06:16.917 --> 1:06:18.417
Let's go!

1:07:44.625 --> 1:07:47.333
BIG: They'll open
their bedroom doors,
and they'll catch me.

1:07:51.125 --> 1:07:53.333
I hope they do.

1:07:54.625 --> 1:07:57.291
Then it'll be over.

1:07:57.375 --> 1:08:02.083
Then it'll be done,
and I'll be able to rest.

1:08:04.417 --> 1:08:09.291
But no, they're not going
to open their doors, are they?

1:08:10.667 --> 1:08:11.917
They're not going to see me

1:08:12.000 --> 1:08:13.959
carrying her
through their house.

1:08:15.750 --> 1:08:18.583
'Cause they're blind.

1:08:18.667 --> 1:08:22.667
Her. Both of them.

1:08:22.750 --> 1:08:25.000
All of them.

1:08:25.083 --> 1:08:26.500
They're blind.

1:09:42.417 --> 1:09:44.208
You're gonna help me out, OK?

1:09:46.917 --> 1:09:48.083
Help me out.

1:10:43.917 --> 1:10:45.792
Come on. Help me out.

1:10:51.750 --> 1:10:56.208
Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.

1:11:20.875 --> 1:11:21.834
OK.

1:13:15.834 --> 1:13:16.959
BUDDY: Big.

1:13:20.667 --> 1:13:21.917
BUDDY: Big.

1:13:25.875 --> 1:13:26.792
Big.

1:13:28.166 --> 1:13:29.333
What's up?

1:13:29.417 --> 1:13:31.166
You ain't like it
at their house?

1:13:34.208 --> 1:13:36.166
learn how to speak

1:13:37.792 --> 1:13:41.041
Must've fell out your pocket
when you was sleepin'.

1:13:41.125 --> 1:13:42.917
Anybody else see you with this?

1:13:43.000 --> 1:13:43.959
No.

1:13:47.709 --> 1:13:50.041
Don't tell nobody, all right?

1:13:50.125 --> 1:13:52.417
You need my help?

1:13:52.500 --> 1:13:54.583
No, just don't tell nobody.

1:13:54.667 --> 1:13:56.208
OK.

1:14:02.667 --> 1:14:05.625
- Hey, baby.
- Hey, Mom.

1:14:05.709 --> 1:14:07.375
TRUDY: I thought
I heard you come in.

1:14:11.125 --> 1:14:13.750
How are things goin'?

1:14:13.834 --> 1:14:17.208
- Uh, good.
- Good?

1:14:17.291 --> 1:14:18.333
Yeah.

1:14:18.417 --> 1:14:21.750
You know, your father and I...

1:14:21.834 --> 1:14:24.792
we used to always talk
about how you shine.

1:14:27.875 --> 1:14:33.000
You're a very special boy,
Bigger, and you've always

1:14:33.083 --> 1:14:35.291
done things your own way.

1:14:35.375 --> 1:14:37.792
And I know, because of that,

1:14:37.875 --> 1:14:40.542
things haven't always
been easy for you.

1:14:43.041 --> 1:14:45.625
And this job may
not be your dream job,

1:14:45.709 --> 1:14:51.792
but I am so proud
of you for taking on
the responsibility.

1:14:51.875 --> 1:14:53.875
And I know your dad
would be, too.

1:15:07.041 --> 1:15:11.375
Good, bread, good meat...
Good Lord, let's eat.

1:15:11.458 --> 1:15:12.375
BUDDY: Amen.

1:15:14.125 --> 1:15:15.417
- Amen.
- Amen.

1:15:16.834 --> 1:15:18.458
BIG:
I'm sitting with them,

1:15:18.542 --> 1:15:21.500
and they don't even
know what I've done.

1:15:21.583 --> 1:15:24.208
- Don't use your fingers.

1:15:24.291 --> 1:15:28.750
BIG: Even if it wasn't me,
folks would assume it was.

1:15:28.834 --> 1:15:30.458
- Hey, Mom.
- Yeah?

1:15:30.542 --> 1:15:34.166
BIG:
So I won't make it me.

1:15:34.250 --> 1:15:36.959
I won't make it anybody.

1:15:39.667 --> 1:15:44.291
I gotta find a way
to be OK somehow.

1:15:44.375 --> 1:15:47.792
Find a way to be
something other than...

1:15:47.875 --> 1:15:53.875
something other than what I am.

1:16:10.458 --> 1:16:12.875
Is Mary coming down?

1:16:12.959 --> 1:16:15.583
( sighs ) I don't think
she came home last night.

1:16:15.667 --> 1:16:17.250
Her bed wasn't slept in.

1:16:17.333 --> 1:16:18.417
No?

1:16:18.500 --> 1:16:20.583
I'll go give her a call.

1:16:50.000 --> 1:16:51.333
Is Mary ready to go?

1:16:53.083 --> 1:16:57.250
( sighs ) Peggy said she
didn't come home last night,

1:16:57.333 --> 1:16:59.625
though I thought I heard her.

1:16:59.709 --> 1:17:03.792
She came home. I brought her.

1:17:11.208 --> 1:17:13.667
TV REPORTER:
Chicago's mayor's office
today announced a plan

1:17:13.750 --> 1:17:18.458
to add affordable housing
to the city's most expensive
and gentrifying neighborhoods.

1:17:18.542 --> 1:17:20.625
Our own George Sherman
explains.

1:17:20.709 --> 1:17:23.542
GEORGE:
The mayor wants to create
a multimillion-dollar fund

1:17:23.625 --> 1:17:25.792
to give low-cost loans
to developers.

1:17:25.875 --> 1:17:27.625
The loans then
would be used for...

1:17:27.709 --> 1:17:30.959
If I prove myself, they'll
put me on the management track,

1:17:31.041 --> 1:17:32.792
which means
I'll be in charge
of the ushers

1:17:32.875 --> 1:17:34.500
and the concession services.

1:17:34.583 --> 1:17:38.291
And I get a say in what kind
of products we stock.

1:17:38.375 --> 1:17:40.500
You know, some candies
just sell better than others.

1:17:40.583 --> 1:17:42.083
BIG:
Is Tony blind, too?

1:17:42.166 --> 1:17:44.041
The more candy you sell,

1:17:44.125 --> 1:17:45.625
the bigger your profit margin.

1:17:45.709 --> 1:17:49.291
Shit, man, I'll be managing
that movie theater one day.

1:17:49.375 --> 1:17:51.792
- You know, God willing.
- ( sighs ) Shit.

1:17:51.875 --> 1:17:54.917
- Yo.
- BIG: Is Gus blind?

1:17:55.000 --> 1:17:56.750
What's good, baby?

1:17:56.834 --> 1:17:59.834
- What's good?
- BIG: Probably.

1:18:02.375 --> 1:18:08.500
BIG: The only thing
worse than being blind
is having sight...

1:18:08.583 --> 1:18:10.041
but no vision.

1:18:12.583 --> 1:18:14.417
BIG:
Maybe everybody's blind.

1:18:16.041 --> 1:18:18.959
Even me.

1:18:19.041 --> 1:18:23.917
( music playing
over headphones )

1:18:46.834 --> 1:18:48.959
MAN: We checked all
the public transportation.

1:18:49.041 --> 1:18:51.792
The rental cars,
the car service...

1:18:51.875 --> 1:18:53.709
HENRY: So she hasn't
gone to Cuba this time.

1:18:53.792 --> 1:18:55.166
Doesn't seem like it, sir.

1:18:55.250 --> 1:18:58.542
How long you been
workin' here, son?

1:18:58.625 --> 1:19:00.000
A little over a month.

1:19:00.083 --> 1:19:02.041
You and Mary like to hang out?

1:19:02.125 --> 1:19:05.667
- Uh, no--
- WOMAN: You're pals
on social media.

1:19:05.750 --> 1:19:07.291
Yeah, well, that's just--

1:19:07.375 --> 1:19:10.125
How about you come downtown
and answer a few questions?

1:19:10.208 --> 1:19:12.166
You're charging
Bigger with a crime?

1:19:12.250 --> 1:19:13.250
Not at all.

1:19:13.333 --> 1:19:14.458
Then I don't see any reason

1:19:14.542 --> 1:19:15.709
why you need to drag him

1:19:15.792 --> 1:19:17.333
downtown for questioning.

1:19:20.667 --> 1:19:25.500
No CCTV, so for now
we're believing your story.

1:19:25.583 --> 1:19:26.917
So you brought 'em here?

1:19:27.000 --> 1:19:28.417
Mary and Jan. Then what?

1:19:28.500 --> 1:19:34.417
Yeah. You know, uh,
Jan's her boyfriend, I guess.

1:19:34.500 --> 1:19:36.083
Why do you guess?

1:19:36.166 --> 1:19:39.500
It's her boyfriend for sure.

1:19:39.583 --> 1:19:42.291
- MAN: And they were drinking.
- Uh-huh.

1:19:42.375 --> 1:19:43.667
You know, Jan's got a flask

1:19:43.750 --> 1:19:46.333
that he's on, uh,
familiar terms with

1:19:46.417 --> 1:19:48.917
if y'all get what I'm saying?

1:19:54.750 --> 1:19:58.542
Um, they went to this party
on the Gold Coast.

1:19:58.625 --> 1:20:01.500
One of Mary's,
uh, college friends.

1:20:01.583 --> 1:20:03.625
What kind of party was it?

1:20:03.709 --> 1:20:06.458
Well, I went inside.

1:20:06.542 --> 1:20:08.208
You know,
it was so cold outside,

1:20:08.291 --> 1:20:10.917
and I could only
keep the car running
for so long, so...

1:20:11.000 --> 1:20:14.792
I went inside.
It was pretty lively in there.

1:20:14.875 --> 1:20:18.709
- You must've had you a time.
- MAN: Mm-hmm.

1:20:18.792 --> 1:20:21.000
Nah, I just stayed by the door.

1:20:21.083 --> 1:20:22.917
But Mary and Jan went in.

1:20:23.000 --> 1:20:28.417
Yeah, uh-huh.
They was having fun.

1:20:28.500 --> 1:20:32.291
You know, uh, smoking
and drinking and...

1:20:32.375 --> 1:20:35.041
you know,
probably doin' other stuff.

1:20:36.709 --> 1:20:37.667
Jan?

1:20:40.458 --> 1:20:41.959
Yeah.

1:20:42.041 --> 1:20:44.834
We've been watchin' him
ever since you asked us to.

1:20:44.917 --> 1:20:47.625
He's associated
with political groups
in Berkeley,

1:20:47.709 --> 1:20:50.667
but hasn't done much here
except run his mouth.

1:20:50.750 --> 1:20:53.333
He's a big-time talker.

1:20:53.417 --> 1:20:54.709
Politics.

1:20:54.792 --> 1:20:56.834
He tried to get you
to join his club

1:20:56.917 --> 1:20:59.709
or whatever he calls it?

1:20:59.792 --> 1:21:00.834
BIG:
I don't got nothing to do

1:21:00.917 --> 1:21:03.041
with that fucking shit.

1:21:03.125 --> 1:21:04.667
I mean-- excuse my language,

1:21:04.750 --> 1:21:07.709
but politics
just ain't my thing.

1:21:09.625 --> 1:21:13.959
Besides, I got
a job anyway, so...

1:21:18.250 --> 1:21:22.375
Hmm. Well,
thanks for allowing us
to talk with you.

1:21:22.458 --> 1:21:26.959
BIG:
There. Asking me questions.

1:21:27.041 --> 1:21:29.667
But they're taking
their cues from Mr. Dalton.

1:21:29.750 --> 1:21:31.834
( chatter continues
indistinctly )

1:21:31.917 --> 1:21:35.583
BIG: Me acting a good negro
is foolin' 'em.

1:21:35.667 --> 1:21:41.500
Even though it's the same act
that they practice every day.

1:21:41.583 --> 1:21:44.333
Sporting their badges,

1:21:44.417 --> 1:21:46.959
but still got
the slave mentality.

1:21:55.750 --> 1:21:57.625
- Just tell us
where the hell she is.
- Look--

1:21:57.709 --> 1:21:59.041
I went home that night!

1:21:59.125 --> 1:22:00.875
After you took her out
for a good time.

1:22:00.959 --> 1:22:04.959
No, I went home by myself.

1:22:05.041 --> 1:22:07.750
Look, I didn't go anywhere
near her fucking house, OK?

1:22:07.834 --> 1:22:10.208
You wanna stick it
to her dad, don't you?

1:22:10.291 --> 1:22:14.417
No, I-- I want a lawyer.

1:22:14.500 --> 1:22:17.375
What did you do to her, Jan!

1:22:17.458 --> 1:22:20.083
( sighs ) You know,

1:22:20.166 --> 1:22:23.041
which part of protect
and serve is this?

1:22:44.542 --> 1:22:46.333
Oh, my God!

1:22:48.667 --> 1:22:51.834
BIG:
It is a peculiar sensation,

1:22:51.917 --> 1:22:56.458
this double consciousness.

1:22:56.542 --> 1:23:01.625
This sense of always
looking at oneself

1:23:01.709 --> 1:23:04.417
through the eyes of others...

1:23:04.500 --> 1:23:07.542
of measure one's soul
by the tape of a world

1:23:07.625 --> 1:23:12.083
that looks on
in amused contempt and pity.

1:23:38.417 --> 1:23:39.333
Hey.

1:23:39.417 --> 1:23:41.583
Hey, yourself.

1:23:43.208 --> 1:23:45.041
How'd you get in?

1:23:45.125 --> 1:23:47.458
The same way I always do.

1:23:52.083 --> 1:23:53.750
What, is that a problem?

1:23:53.834 --> 1:23:56.166
No, it's just that, uh,

1:23:56.250 --> 1:23:58.750
the movie doesn't start
for another hour or so.

1:24:01.208 --> 1:24:02.583
Yeah.

1:24:04.709 --> 1:24:08.792
Yeah, uh... ( clears throat )...
I'ma just wait it out.

1:24:12.250 --> 1:24:15.041
You want some popcorn
or somethin'?

1:24:15.125 --> 1:24:19.458
- No, I'm good.
- No, Big, I'll get you
some popcorn. No sweat.

1:25:10.166 --> 1:25:13.083
I didn't think
you'd come.

1:25:13.166 --> 1:25:15.792
You got the cops
around the corner
or somethin'?

1:25:18.125 --> 1:25:20.208
You know
I'm not like that,

1:25:23.041 --> 1:25:24.875
What happened
to your face?

1:25:27.208 --> 1:25:28.792
What do you think?

1:25:37.792 --> 1:25:39.709
I know you're innocent.

1:25:41.041 --> 1:25:44.583
Whatever happened out there,
it was, uh...

1:25:44.667 --> 1:25:46.208
I mean,
it was some kind of accident.

1:25:46.291 --> 1:25:50.250
Sure, they're tryin' to say
that, uh...

1:25:50.333 --> 1:25:52.917
I raped her
'cause her body's burned.

1:25:56.417 --> 1:25:58.667
Mary was, uh...

1:26:04.291 --> 1:26:06.500
I didn't, uh...

1:26:08.375 --> 1:26:11.583
you know, rape her or...

1:26:13.792 --> 1:26:15.458
get with her....

1:26:15.542 --> 1:26:18.083
or any of that.

1:26:23.083 --> 1:26:25.250
I know a good lawyer.

1:26:27.917 --> 1:26:29.917
- He'll help you.
- It's--

1:26:30.000 --> 1:26:31.792
It's too late for that.

1:26:31.875 --> 1:26:34.625
And the Daltons, man,
they'll be on your side

1:26:34.709 --> 1:26:37.750
- if you just turn yourself in.
- It's too late for that!

1:26:54.500 --> 1:26:56.917
I thought
we were friends.

1:27:24.000 --> 1:27:25.375
MAN ON TV:
Let us pray

1:27:25.458 --> 1:27:27.291
for the woman lost,
Mary Dalton.

1:27:27.375 --> 1:27:29.000
- Unh-unh. Unh-unh.
- And let us pray

1:27:29.083 --> 1:27:31.375
for our brother Bigger Thomas.

1:27:31.458 --> 1:27:34.208
And why do they say
he's guilty?

1:27:34.291 --> 1:27:35.875
Because in their minds,

1:27:36.000 --> 1:27:38.750
he was guilty
before he was born.

1:27:38.834 --> 1:27:42.375
- He's got black guilt.

1:27:42.458 --> 1:27:46.083
There ain't nobody in this city
free of this scourge.

1:27:46.166 --> 1:27:48.750
Some of us got black guilt.

1:27:48.834 --> 1:27:52.250
- ( crying ) Unh-unh!
- Some of us got white guilt.

1:27:52.333 --> 1:27:55.959
Two sides of the same
godforsaken...

1:27:56.041 --> 1:27:59.875
two sides of
the same shameful story.

1:28:12.583 --> 1:28:15.542
- I'm not hungry.

1:28:27.291 --> 1:28:28.959
You're gonna
turn yourself in, right?

1:28:29.041 --> 1:28:30.792
For what?

1:28:30.875 --> 1:28:33.709
- I didn't do nothin'.
- Then tell 'em that.

1:28:33.792 --> 1:28:37.000
You can't stay back here
forever.

1:28:45.250 --> 1:28:48.959
Yesterday when they came around
askin' about you,

1:28:49.041 --> 1:28:50.625
I didn't tell 'em nothin'.

1:28:50.709 --> 1:28:52.667
That's good.

1:28:53.709 --> 1:28:55.208
That's good.

1:29:00.709 --> 1:29:02.333
You shoulda let me cut it.

1:29:02.417 --> 1:29:03.875
I'm all right.

1:29:07.250 --> 1:29:11.291
You know, you're always
talkin' about wantin'
to get married.

1:29:12.583 --> 1:29:14.250
Well, let's do that.

1:29:14.333 --> 1:29:16.250
Let's just run away
and get married.

1:29:19.208 --> 1:29:21.208
Did you kill her?

1:29:28.083 --> 1:29:30.000
You killed her.

1:29:30.083 --> 1:29:32.083
No.

1:29:32.166 --> 1:29:33.667
I didn't.

1:29:33.750 --> 1:29:36.041
But if they catch me,

1:29:36.125 --> 1:29:37.625
they'll pin it on me

1:29:37.709 --> 1:29:40.166
and they'll twist it up
and make it seem like I did it.

1:29:40.250 --> 1:29:42.917
- You want that for me?
- So you gotta tell 'em
that you didn't.

1:29:43.000 --> 1:29:45.375
- Tell Mr. Dalton.
- Mr. Dalton...

1:29:45.458 --> 1:29:46.792
doesn't want to hear from me.

1:29:49.041 --> 1:29:50.792
I don't know what
happened to her.

1:29:53.125 --> 1:29:54.834
But what I...

1:29:54.917 --> 1:29:56.625
what I do know...

1:29:58.375 --> 1:30:00.125
is that I need you.

1:30:00.208 --> 1:30:02.041
You're not makin' any sense.

1:30:02.125 --> 1:30:03.417
Run away with me.

1:30:11.917 --> 1:30:13.625
They'll catch us.

1:30:14.959 --> 1:30:16.959
Not if we're smart.

1:30:19.542 --> 1:30:22.208
Not if we lay low.

1:30:22.291 --> 1:30:24.125
Yeah?

1:30:24.208 --> 1:30:25.959
We lay low and...

1:30:28.000 --> 1:30:29.667
we hide out...

1:30:31.166 --> 1:30:34.625
you know, we just wait
until things blow over.

1:30:37.834 --> 1:30:39.458
Then we just go.

1:30:45.166 --> 1:30:46.667
All right?

1:30:48.333 --> 1:30:49.917
Yeah, OK.

1:30:50.000 --> 1:30:51.208
OK.

1:30:53.834 --> 1:30:55.792
Now get your coat.

1:30:57.792 --> 1:30:59.208
Go on.

1:31:02.291 --> 1:31:04.333
Baby, get your coat.

1:31:33.208 --> 1:31:35.291
Hey. Hey.

1:31:35.375 --> 1:31:37.250
Put your coat on.

1:31:37.333 --> 1:31:38.875
You'll catch cold.

1:31:51.083 --> 1:31:52.583
You got it.

1:31:54.208 --> 1:31:55.917
I found a spot.

1:31:57.250 --> 1:31:59.542
Where?

1:31:59.625 --> 1:32:01.667
It's a good spot.

1:32:01.750 --> 1:32:05.375
OK?

1:32:05.458 --> 1:32:07.875
Please don't do this
to me, Big.

1:32:09.625 --> 1:32:11.917
I done everything for you
I know how,

1:32:12.000 --> 1:32:14.208
but please don't
do this to me.

1:32:14.291 --> 1:32:18.000
I don't bother nobody.
I just go to work
and I go to school....

1:32:18.083 --> 1:32:22.041
- Hey. Hey.
- Please don't do this
to me.

1:32:22.125 --> 1:32:24.250
Hey. Hey. Hey.

1:32:24.333 --> 1:32:26.125
Baby, I love you.

1:32:26.208 --> 1:32:29.208
I love you.
You gotta trust me.

1:32:29.291 --> 1:32:31.583
- OK? Hey.

1:32:31.667 --> 1:32:32.625
Hey.

1:32:32.709 --> 1:32:34.792
You gotta trust me, OK?

1:32:40.625 --> 1:32:42.125
OK?

1:32:42.208 --> 1:32:43.500
You trust me?

1:32:48.250 --> 1:32:49.458
OK.

1:33:12.291 --> 1:33:14.041
This is a good spot.

1:33:34.583 --> 1:33:35.959
Big.

1:33:38.166 --> 1:33:40.625
If you ain't

1:33:40.709 --> 1:33:42.583
Hey. Hey.

1:33:46.000 --> 1:33:47.709
I got this.

1:34:17.542 --> 1:34:18.875
Hey.

1:34:23.542 --> 1:34:25.375
You sleep all right?

1:34:32.792 --> 1:34:34.792
( grunt ) I'm not--

1:34:52.333 --> 1:34:54.542
I don't want to.

1:34:55.875 --> 1:34:58.917
I can't be with you
right now. I--

1:34:59.000 --> 1:35:01.458
I came this far,
and that's all I can do.

1:35:01.542 --> 1:35:03.333
Baby, you ain't even
gotta do--

1:35:03.417 --> 1:35:05.250
No.

1:35:05.333 --> 1:35:08.375
- Stop.

1:35:08.458 --> 1:35:10.834
Stop. Stop it!

1:35:10.917 --> 1:35:12.458
Stop!!!

1:35:12.542 --> 1:35:14.917
- Bessie!

1:35:15.041 --> 1:35:17.542
Bessie. Bessie!

1:35:17.625 --> 1:35:19.625
Did you kill her?

1:35:23.792 --> 1:35:25.291
I--

1:35:39.875 --> 1:35:40.959
Gimme that.

1:35:42.583 --> 1:35:44.458
Come on, give me the gun.

1:35:45.625 --> 1:35:47.458
No.

1:36:13.792 --> 1:36:15.500
Why you gotta do that?

1:36:15.583 --> 1:36:19.750
You gotta turn yourself in, Big.

1:36:25.125 --> 1:36:27.834
- What you do that for?
- Big.

1:36:29.834 --> 1:36:32.709
- Baby. Baby.
- Why would you do that, Bessie?

1:36:34.417 --> 1:36:35.875
Baby.

1:36:44.834 --> 1:36:46.750
Why you do that? Hmm?

1:36:48.917 --> 1:36:51.166
Why you do that?

1:36:51.250 --> 1:36:54.041
- Why you do that?

1:36:55.834 --> 1:36:58.709
You're gonna kill me too.

1:37:01.792 --> 1:37:04.750
Aaah!

1:37:07.208 --> 1:37:08.125
No.

1:37:15.041 --> 1:37:16.667
I'm so sorry.

1:37:21.625 --> 1:37:23.458
I'm so sorry, baby.

1:37:27.500 --> 1:37:29.959
Baby, I'm so sorry.

1:37:34.959 --> 1:37:36.542
I'm so--

1:37:41.583 --> 1:37:43.125
Bessie, I'm s--

1:37:45.375 --> 1:37:47.750
