Marcella, what do you want?

01:35.480 --> 01:37.759
Jason, you've gotta help me.
I can't.

01:37.760 --> 01:40.820
No, there has to be a reason.
Just tell me why.

<i>"Look... I'll call you once you've
had time to think about things."</i>

01:45.080 --> 01:47.119
What am I supposed to think about?

01:47.120 --> 01:49.159
You didn't say anything.

01:49.160 --> 01:51.199
And I don't know anything.

01:53.778 --> 01:56.007

06:47.160 --> 06:50.540
Busy morning?
I had to take the car to the garage.

06:51.240 --> 06:53.279
I thought it was brand-new.
It is.

06:53.280 --> 06:56.300

concrete jobs for Brenthams.

07:35.760 --> 07:38.500

07:39.083 --> 07:41.140
They're a... new relationship.

07:41.358 --> 07:43.806

foothold in new markets.

07:43.807 --> 07:46.311

your old relationships?

07:46.312 --> 07:48.420
Course not.

07:49.056 --> 07:50.364
Jason?

07:52.066 --> 07:56.246
With this new information, I took the
liberty of rewriting our contracts.

07:56.696 --> 07:58.900
You can't do that, Sylvie.

07:59.561 --> 08:02.199
I represent more than
half your turnover.

08:02.200 --> 08:05.940
Sylvie.
It's a long way down, Phil.

08:06.096 --> 08:09.420
Metaphorically speaking.
That... wasn't meant as a threat.

08:15.160 --> 08:19.380
You'll drop by a third... but
you won't fall all the way.

nothing in particular.

08:42.280 --> 08:44.700

08:59.720 --> 09:03.220
DI Rav Sangha.
I work with DCI Laura Porter.

09:03.820 --> 09:06.840
Right.
It's about the... Grove Park murders.

09:09.740 --> 09:12.040
Come in.

09:16.500 --> 09:18.819
You might not remember it.
It was a long time ago.

09:18.820 --> 09:22.499
2005. Two women, one man,
killed in their homes.

09:22.500 --> 09:24.688
Plastic bags over their heads.

09:24.689 --> 09:27.617
Tied around the throats
with insulating tape.

09:27.618 --> 09:31.400
Hands and feet tied...
with cable ties.

09:31.874 --> 09:33.880
Trophies taken from the scenes.

09:34.940 --> 09:37.520
I'm impressed.
Well, don't be.

09:38.118 --> 09:42.200
We never got him.
Yep. Well, it looks like he's back.

09:42.350 --> 09:44.680
We found our second victim
last night.

09:45.560 --> 09:48.060
An eleven year gap?
It looks like it.

09:48.285 --> 09:50.439
The woman we found last
night, Carol Fincher,

09:50.440 --> 09:53.609
she lost her job at Bonn
Electronics six months ago.

09:53.610 --> 09:58.239
Laura thinks she interviewed someone
called Bonn in the previous investigation.

09:58.240 --> 10:00.279
But we cannot find the transcript.

10:00.280 --> 10:03.737
The second victim was dating...
a Clive Bonn?

10:03.738 --> 10:06.667
Er... yeah. But a few weeks
before she was murdered.

10:06.668 --> 10:09.519
We interviewed him, but he had an alibi.
Clive Bonn?

10:09.520 --> 10:12.620
Yeah. Lives in Harrow.
Or did at the time.

10:14.370 --> 10:16.580
Can I take a look?

10:20.640 --> 10:24.140
That's Liz Harper. Husband came
home and found her two weeks ago.

10:25.081 --> 10:26.320
Hm. And...?

10:26.321 --> 10:29.439
Carol Fincher.
Divorced, no children, lived alone.

10:29.440 --> 10:32.841
Found her last night but, as you
can see, killed before Harper. <i>Mm.</i>

10:32.842 --> 10:37.288
Peter Cullen. Have you talked to him? He was
our prime suspect. <i>Mm-hm. It's not him.</i>

10:37.289 --> 10:38.879
He's behind bars.

10:38.880 --> 10:40.919
For what?
Manslaughter.

10:40.920 --> 10:43.359
Killed his wife eight years ago.

10:43.590 --> 10:46.504
So he has killed.
Yes. But not these two.

10:46.505 --> 10:49.643
Yeah. Can I keep these?
No. Why?

10:52.353 --> 10:54.971
Well, just to... look over
with a fresh pair of eyes.

10:54.972 --> 10:58.515
But you're not actually on the
force, are you? So... you can't.

10:59.207 --> 11:01.380
Do you wanna call Laura and ask?

11:53.137 --> 11:56.100
DCI Laura Porter.

11:56.920 --> 11:59.628
Hey. It's Marcella Backland.

12:00.117 --> 12:02.936
Hi, Marcella. My God.
It's been ages. How are you?

12:02.937 --> 12:05.362
Er, I'm good, thank you. Erm...

12:06.167 --> 12:08.714
One of your detectives
visited me today.

12:08.715 --> 12:11.860
Yes. Rav. Did you find
something in the reports?

12:14.720 --> 12:16.900
I wanna come back to work.

12:31.840 --> 12:34.239
This is DS Marcella Backland.

12:34.240 --> 12:37.559
She's been on a career break for
several years, raising a family.

12:37.560 --> 12:39.599
She's gonna be working with us.

12:39.600 --> 12:43.105
Now, Marcella worked on the
Grove Park case back in 2005.

12:43.106 --> 12:45.820
So we're pleased she's
joining our team.

12:46.106 --> 12:48.719
Right. Forensics have finished
at Carol Fincher's place.

12:48.720 --> 12:50.759
Same kind of plastic bag and tape.

12:50.760 --> 12:53.347
Sorry. The same as in 2005
or on the other victim?

12:53.348 --> 12:56.531
Both. No signs of forced entry.
All points to the same offender.

12:56.532 --> 12:58.199
Did you get hold of Clive Bonn.
<i>Yep.</i>

12:58.200 --> 13:02.220
He claims to have never met or even
heard of Carol Fincher or Liz Harper.

13:02.297 --> 13:05.660
And what about the other suspects
from the 2005 investigation?

13:05.912 --> 13:09.719
Well, we've got hold of pretty much all of them.
They've been questioned and written off. Alex.

13:09.720 --> 13:13.719
All the pictures we've got of Carol Fincher,
she's wearing this Thomas Sabo bracelet.

13:13.720 --> 13:17.879
Six charms on it. It's missing
Carol's telephone and computer records.

13:17.880 --> 13:22.439
She was registered with a dating site.
Meet. That's ME-E-T, not M-E-A-T.

13:22.440 --> 13:27.224
Anyway, we're working out whether she's
had any contact with people on that site.

13:27.225 --> 13:29.765
Right. And was Liz Harper
registered with them as well?

13:29.766 --> 13:31.820
We're working on it. But the...

13:31.839 --> 13:34.679
The four last unanswered calls
to Carol's phone

13:34.680 --> 13:37.254
were from a former colleague,
Joanna Duggan.

13:37.255 --> 13:41.079
Right. Alex, Marcella - find her. See if
she can tell us who Carol might have met.

13:41.080 --> 13:43.759
You want me to go?
<i>Is that a problem?</i>

13:43.760 --> 13:48.260
No, it's just - <i>You weren't expecting to
work today?</i> Of course I was. <i>Well, then.</i>

13:56.660 --> 13:59.699
I feel so guilty. I should've gone over.
Why didn't you?

13:59.700 --> 14:01.112
Erm...

14:01.427 --> 14:04.176
There were times where she
wanted to be left alone.

14:04.177 --> 14:06.840
You rang her.
<i>Quite a bit.</i>

14:06.967 --> 14:09.364
You didn't think it was strange
when she didn't call you back?

14:09.365 --> 14:11.659
To be honest, I was a
tiny bit relieved.

14:11.660 --> 14:14.052
She kept going on about
her husband leaving her.

14:14.053 --> 14:17.680
Well, maybe it was the worst
thing that ever happened to her.

14:18.468 --> 14:22.938
Right. It's just there is a limit to
what you can bear to hear over and over.

14:22.939 --> 14:26.480
Were you aware that she was a
recovering alcoholic? <i>Yes.</i>

14:26.820 --> 14:31.547
And it didn't occur to you that maybe she'd started
drinking again and that's why she didn't call.

14:31.548 --> 14:33.640
I said I felt guilty, didn't I?

14:34.660 --> 14:36.699
Do you, um...

14:36.700 --> 14:39.400
Do you mind if I take this?

14:39.796 --> 14:42.096
Erm... no.

14:43.976 --> 14:46.276
Thank you.

14:49.160 --> 14:52.740
Did erm... did Carol ever
mention a Peter Cullen?

14:54.122 --> 14:56.902
No.
<i>You've never seen this man?</i>

14:58.984 --> 15:01.271
Ah... no.

15:02.680 --> 15:04.980
Sure?
<i>Yeah.</i>

15:05.070 --> 15:07.020
Thanks.

15:08.960 --> 15:11.879
Marcella? Why are you asking
questions about Peter Cullen?

15:11.880 --> 15:16.639
Well, he's not locked up, is he? He's in an open prison,
doing a work scheme three days a week in a bakery.

15:16.640 --> 15:19.199
You said he was behind bars
so he couldn't have done it.

15:19.200 --> 15:21.479
Prison officers drive him
to the bakery and back

15:21.480 --> 15:23.959
and a supervisor's watching
him during the day.

15:23.960 --> 15:27.479
2005, his car was spotted one
block away from the first murder.

15:27.480 --> 15:29.799
And he had a very good
explanation for being there.

15:29.800 --> 15:32.359
He had the same insulating tape.
<i>It's a common brand.</i>

15:32.360 --> 15:35.460
And he didn't have any alibis.
<i>It's all circumstantial!</i>

15:35.586 --> 15:37.719
We've looked into it,
we've ruled him out,

15:37.720 --> 15:41.270
and, just so you know, we don't
fly solo on this team. <i>Clive Bonn.</i>

15:42.890 --> 15:45.890
He said he didn't know Carol
Fincher, right? <i>Yeah. Why?</i>

15:52.801 --> 15:55.101
Alex, get Laura on the phone.

15:55.386 --> 15:58.166
OK, Mr Bonn. You said...

15:58.360 --> 16:00.660
you'd never met Carol Fincher.

16:01.360 --> 16:04.740
The one on the right is Carol Fincher
and the man in the middle is you.

16:04.854 --> 16:07.194
Apparently, I was wrong.

16:08.120 --> 16:12.060
When and where was that photo taken?
<i>Why don't you ask the photographer?</i>

16:12.214 --> 16:14.394
I'm asking you.

16:15.440 --> 16:18.319
The company was having its
20th anniversary in July,

16:18.320 --> 16:20.359
so I came back from Rome for that.

16:20.360 --> 16:23.239
And met Carol Fincher. If
met means accidentally

16:23.240 --> 16:26.900
ending up in the same
photo as her, then... yes.

16:27.753 --> 16:32.119
You fired her a month later.
<i>We let 50 people go at that time.</i>

16:32.120 --> 16:34.142
HR handled everything.

16:34.202 --> 16:37.620
Liz Harper.
You said you never met her either.

16:37.950 --> 16:40.860
You got a photo of us two?
<i>Is there one?</i>

16:41.552 --> 16:42.883
No.

16:44.773 --> 16:48.919
So... er, are there any other women I
don't know you wanna talk to me about?

16:48.920 --> 16:51.220
Or are we done?

16:51.435 --> 16:53.690
Nope. We're done. Thank you.

16:53.691 --> 16:58.599
Clive Bonn. Connected to one of the
2005 victims and to Carol Fincher.

16:58.600 --> 17:02.079
Now if there's any connection to the
other victims, I want us to find it now.

17:02.080 --> 17:06.959
Mark. Contact police in Rome. See if they've had
any murders similar to ours between 2006 and now.

17:06.960 --> 17:09.519
Er, Clive Bonn had an alibi in 2005.

17:09.520 --> 17:12.039
And he moved to Italy in 2006
and the murders stopped.

17:12.040 --> 17:14.443
He returned three months ago
and we've got new bodies.

17:14.444 --> 17:17.638
Could be a coincidence. <i>Could be but It's
enough reason for us to investigate.</i>

17:17.640 --> 17:22.212
But we don't care that the murders started again
when P.Cullen got in touch with the outside world.

17:22.213 --> 17:24.099
Right.

17:26.280 --> 17:28.639
What did I say about Cullen?
<i>That you've ruled him out.</i>

17:28.640 --> 17:31.209
I think that's a mistake.
<i>I don't care what you think.</i>

17:31.210 --> 17:34.100
He's in prison being
monitored around the clock.

20:32.640 --> 20:34.679
Enough business talk.
Let's celebrate.

20:34.680 --> 20:38.060
Why have a department for environmental
issues if we just ignore them?

20:38.061 --> 20:43.060
Because you needed a job. And, unlike my
daughter, you can't actually do anything.

20:50.400 --> 20:52.700
Stephen, Grace.
<i>Henry.</i>

20:54.000 --> 20:56.039
Henry, come on.

21:45.048 --> 21:47.348
So you were home.

21:47.884 --> 21:50.184
You still consider this your home?

22:05.569 --> 22:09.110
Where are you living at the moment?
<i>At Greg's.</i>

22:09.645 --> 22:11.559
We'll have to see after that.

22:11.560 --> 22:13.860
Hey, about the car.

22:14.154 --> 22:15.738
What?

22:22.170 --> 22:25.142
Forget it. I probably deserved it.

22:32.761 --> 22:34.807
We're gonna have to tell the kids.

22:37.470 --> 22:40.141
We'll tell them when they come
home from school at the weekend.

22:40.142 --> 22:44.520
It'll turn into a big thing if we both
drive up there. <i>IT IS a BIG THING!</i>

23:22.640 --> 23:23.940
♪

23:32.720 --> 23:35.020
No!

23:41.929 --> 23:44.229
I'm grateful to you for everything.

23:45.078 --> 23:48.258
But these last few years,
I've... felt alone.

23:49.036 --> 23:51.163
Like... we've nothing in common.

23:51.164 --> 23:52.425
Except the kids.

23:52.426 --> 23:56.060

That's something you work at.

kicked me down the stairs.

Hey.

Hi.

28:42.195 --> 28:44.840
These are for you.
<i>Why am I getting flowers?</i>

28:45.142 --> 28:47.962
Well... it's a thank you.

28:48.100 --> 28:50.400
For all your help.

28:52.579 --> 28:53.895
Oh.

28:56.412 --> 28:59.112
I didn't realise this was
gonna be the last time.

28:59.429 --> 29:01.779
Well, I've got everything
I need, I think.

29:03.272 --> 29:06.492
Unless... you've thought
of something.

29:07.333 --> 29:09.419
I can help you a lot more.

29:09.420 --> 29:11.019
A lot, lot more.

29:13.620 --> 29:15.920
I'd really like to go on seeing you.

29:17.020 --> 29:20.480
You're going to think it's worth it.

29:21.102 --> 29:22.717
I promise.

29:26.430 --> 29:28.730
Yeah. It'll be nice.

29:51.099 --> 29:54.199
Sorry I'm late.
<i>Not interested. We've got a third victim.</i>

29:55.100 --> 29:57.139
Benjamin Williams.

29:57.140 --> 30:01.000
We checked Bonn. According to his wife,
he was at home at the time of the murder.

30:01.001 --> 30:04.663
There's a shop outside Williams's flat
with CCTV. Go and get the footage.

30:04.664 --> 30:07.200
Can't one of the DCs do that?

30:07.298 --> 30:09.598
Yeah. They could.

30:15.219 --> 30:18.639
Mark? Do me a favour. Will you
do an identity check on...

30:20.260 --> 30:22.560
...this girl here?

30:23.238 --> 30:25.858
First name Maddy.
<i>Who's the guy?</i>

30:26.543 --> 30:28.843
Peter Cullen.

30:29.347 --> 30:30.739
OK, send it to me.

30:30.740 --> 30:33.760
But if Rav asks, I'm gonna tell.
I'm a terrible liar.

30:33.887 --> 30:35.398
Good.

30:35.411 --> 30:37.887
I wish more men were.

In brief, profitability is up.

30:43.029 --> 30:45.459
Thank you, Grace.
Let's move on to the next issue.

30:45.460 --> 30:47.920
Forgive me. Just one more thing.

30:48.181 --> 30:50.720
Our project in Lambeth.

30:51.333 --> 30:52.886
This isn't on the agenda.

30:52.887 --> 30:56.732
I have an item on the agenda
and I haven't finished yet.

31:03.068 --> 31:07.088
As you can see, my brother's report
clearly raises issues. So, Jason?

31:07.180 --> 31:10.520
Couldn't the council sue us,
given the current setup?

31:11.166 --> 31:13.739
I...don't have the entire agreement
in my head.

31:13.740 --> 31:17.440
Well, we promised them a park.
Is that what we're supplying?

31:18.180 --> 31:22.680
Well, that, like so much else,
is... open to interpretation.

31:22.687 --> 31:26.619
And if the council's interpretation is
that we're not keeping our promises,

31:26.620 --> 31:30.220
could that affect future construction
work on publicly owned sites?

31:30.329 --> 31:32.699
Well, obviously it could, in theory.

31:32.700 --> 31:34.739
Can they shut down Lambeth?

31:34.740 --> 31:38.080
Oh, for God's sake!
He's not a bloody fortune teller.

31:39.246 --> 31:40.939
Jason?

31:41.627 --> 31:43.280
Once again...

31:43.533 --> 31:45.879
In theory... yes.

31:45.880 --> 31:49.040
They could.
<i>Thank you.</i>

31:49.153 --> 31:52.419
I'd like to call a vote on whether we
should have my brother and his department

31:52.420 --> 31:55.000
take another look
at the Lambeth Project.

32:01.638 --> 32:03.938
OK.

32:18.660 --> 32:21.880
Hi, there. What can I do for you?

32:54.568 --> 32:56.948
OK. Thanks. Bye.

<i>Thanks</i>.

So, why go against her?

34:47.380 --> 34:52.360
Henry doesn't care or understand. But you're
too smart to put your neck on the line, Grace.

Especially for him.
<i>Lambeth might hurt us.</i>

to make happy in this family.
