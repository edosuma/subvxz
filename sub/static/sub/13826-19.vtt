stupid chin and your dumb cape!

12:30.959 --> 12:33.003
It's not dumb! It's hand stitched!

12:33.462 --> 12:34.796
And my chin is perfect!

LORD HATER: You'll never defeat me,
Starlight!

12:47.643 --> 12:49.353
You might as well give up now!

12:50.479 --> 12:53.524
Not as long as there's an ounce
of strength left in my lithe,

12:53.607 --> 12:54.775
well-sculpted body.

12:54.983 --> 12:55.984
Hey!

12:56.318 --> 12:57.319
Hello!

13:19.341 --> 13:20.968
What are you sillies doing here?

13:21.051 --> 13:24.263
Hey, I'm playing Hide and Seek
with Sylvia. Y'all wanna play too?

13:24.346 --> 13:25.556
Okay. Come and get me!

13:25.639 --> 13:27.266
(WANDER LAUGHING)

13:27.516 --> 13:30.352
BOTH: Wander? I can't believe
he came here to stop me!

13:30.811 --> 13:32.729
Whoah! Came here to stop you?

13:32.813 --> 13:35.190
Uh, yeah, he's my greatest enemy.

13:35.274 --> 13:38.402
WANDER: Hey guys! Hide and Seek!
Let's go!

13:42.072 --> 13:43.740
Wander ruined my wedding!

13:43.866 --> 13:47.077
If it wasn't for him, I'd be married
to a super-pretty princess!

13:48.120 --> 13:50.747
So? Wander's ruined dozens of my plans.

13:50.831 --> 13:52.791
One of which also involved my wedding!

13:52.875 --> 13:53.876
Really? How?

13:53.959 --> 13:55.961
His dumb friend Sylvia was in disguise.

13:56.044 --> 13:57.963
You mean his steed? (LAUGHS)

13:58.046 --> 13:59.548
You almost married his horse!

13:59.798 --> 14:01.925
It was a very convincing disguise.

14:02.009 --> 14:04.011

14:06.555 --> 14:10.058
Wanna put this whole sword thing
on hold for a sec, and go destroy him?

14:10.267 --> 14:14.563
So, you're offering me your services
to help me in my quest to destroy Wander?

14:14.855 --> 14:15.939
Yeah, sure, whatever.

to the side of evil!
