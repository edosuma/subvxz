more than...

43:12.715 --> 43:13.590
a desire to destroy the planet.

43:16.677 --> 43:18.929
Then it has emotions.

43:23.642 --> 43:24.727
I gave birth to it.

43:27.271 --> 43:30.065
So it likely does.

43:32.109 --> 43:35.487
So it is your caregiving
program that is the issue.

43:35.571 --> 43:36.864
Yes.

43:37.614 --> 43:42.202
I--I can't seem to destroy it.

43:42.286 --> 43:44.371
My veil.

43:44.455 --> 43:47.249
Perhaps it could be transplanted.

43:47.333 --> 43:49.585
It could help to null
your caregiving impulses.

43:52.671 --> 43:55.257
It's a sensory filter
of some kind?

43:55.341 --> 43:57.051
Yes.

43:57.051 --> 44:00.387
We are able to make the best
decisions for humans that way.

44:01.847 --> 44:04.224
Will it be difficult
for you to remove it?

44:05.976 --> 44:07.478
No more difficult
than it will be

44:07.478 --> 44:09.063
for you to wear it.

What are you doing?

44:59.446 --> 45:02.658
My spinal column is fracturing.

45:03.951 --> 45:05.452
We'll find a way
to repair it, but we have to--

45:05.536 --> 45:07.663
No. This will total me.

In about four

I'm going offline.

45:14.795 --> 45:17.297
Permanent sign-off.

45:17.381 --> 45:19.508
I only have time to get
some of it down.

45:20.551 --> 45:23.429

Her favorite days.

The first thing Mom made me do

45:25.973 --> 45:27.141
was download
all of her diaries.

45:27.141 --> 45:30.144
Made mimicking her easy.

45:30.144 --> 45:32.062
It's important that her
thoughts are preserved.

45:32.980 --> 45:36.066
It would have made her
happy to know

45:36.150 --> 45:38.902
