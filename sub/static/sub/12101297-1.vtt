It's a small private college upstate.

He hates the struggle here.

he was even taking money from them.

since Franny was born.

-[George] Huh?

07:22.275 --> 07:26.529
As I told George last week,
it's from the late 1800s.

07:26.612 --> 07:27.447
Mm.

07:27.530 --> 07:30.450
[woman] There's definitely
updating that needs to be done.

07:30.533 --> 07:33.077
Yes, certainly could use a paint job.

07:33.161 --> 07:35.830
Yeah, but look at these bones, huh?
Amazing!

07:35.913 --> 07:38.791
You have to have a real vision

so we're in good hands.

Hey, uh, George,

09:14.428 --> 09:17.640
I was gonna put your little seascapes,
you know, above the piano,

09:17.723 --> 09:19.475
-but I-- I can't find them.
-Oh.

09:19.559 --> 09:21.727
-Sorry. I packed them for my office.
-Aw.

09:21.811 --> 09:23.187
I love those things.

09:23.271 --> 09:26.566
Yeah, I thought it would show off
a relic of my former life. Oh!

09:27.817 --> 09:31.571
You know, maybe this house is going
to inspire you to start painting again.

09:31.654 --> 09:36.576
Mm, nah, I think, since my dissertation,
I… I really see myself as a writer.

09:38.995 --> 09:41.330
Okay, the cat or the doll?

09:41.414 --> 09:42.456
Which one?

I think she's finally out.

Are you stressed about tomorrow?

09:56.804 --> 09:59.557
Yeah-- No. Should I be?

Well, first day jitters
are a normal human reaction.

Are you looking for a reason to de-stress?

10:09.525 --> 10:11.736

-No.

Oh, it is a dream setting for a campus.

12:01.429 --> 12:03.097
Full disclosure, Claire.

12:03.180 --> 12:07.351
Your chapter on how Swedenborg
influenced the art of George Inness

12:07.435 --> 12:08.644
is what landed you here.

12:08.728 --> 12:11.814
[chuckles] Swedenborg, really?
That's… that's interesting.

12:11.897 --> 12:14.817
It's the part of my dissertation
I struggled with the most.

12:14.900 --> 12:15.860
How so?

12:15.943 --> 12:21.282
[inhales sharply] Uh, I-I guess
I'm a bit of a cliché, the New York cynic.

12:21.365 --> 12:25.327
That… How a-a painter
as brilliant as Inness

12:25.411 --> 12:29.623
could fall for some 18th-century mystic
still baffles me.

12:29.707 --> 12:32.001
[chuckles] Well, Swedenborg…

12:32.668 --> 12:35.629
He wasn't just some mystic.

12:35.713 --> 12:39.550
He keenly understood
that everything in the natural world

12:39.633 --> 12:42.094
has a counterpart in the spiritual realm.

12:42.845 --> 12:45.765
And Inness painted landscapes
with this in mind.

12:45.848 --> 12:46.891
I-I get that.

12:46.974 --> 12:49.226
Oh, this is my office in case you need me.

12:49.310 --> 12:51.020
-Wow, beautiful.
-Mh-hm.

12:52.897 --> 12:57.651
My-- my trouble with Swedenborg is
his communicating with angels and ghosts.

12:57.735 --> 13:01.614
Glorifying death as this…
as this grand passage.

13:01.697 --> 13:04.909
You should know that Swedenborg
still has a devoted following

13:04.992 --> 13:07.661
in this neck of the woods,
myself included.

13:08.412 --> 13:11.707
We even have séances on occasion.
I'll invite you.

13:12.666 --> 13:15.169
[chuckles] I'll-- I will bring my wife.

13:15.252 --> 13:18.130
She is the…
the true believer of the family.

13:18.214 --> 13:19.256
Ah, ah.

13:19.340 --> 13:21.759
Well, this is your office right here.

13:25.805 --> 13:26.847
[George chuckles]

13:27.473 --> 13:30.142
[man] I guess I picked
the wrong welcome gift.

13:30.226 --> 13:34.897
[George chuckles]
Well, I… I can't argue with the cover art.

13:34.980 --> 13:36.732
The Valley of the Shadow of Death.

13:36.816 --> 13:39.860
Ahh, that is George Inness at his best.

13:39.944 --> 13:42.780
Well, you are now
officially in Inness territory.

13:43.614 --> 13:46.116
Don't be surprised
if you start seeing things his way.

13:46.200 --> 13:47.117

13:48.786 --> 13:50.037
Thank you, Floyd.

14:25.698 --> 14:27.241
-[Catherine] Hi.
-Hello.

14:27.324 --> 14:28.284
Mrs. Claire, right?

14:28.868 --> 14:30.411
Yeah, can I help you?

14:30.494 --> 14:31.954
Uh, yes, ma'am.

14:32.037 --> 14:32.872
Um…

14:33.372 --> 14:36.917
My name's Eddie Lucks,
and this here's my younger brother Cole.

14:37.001 --> 14:40.838
We just wanted to introduce ourselves
in case you're in need of a hired hand.

14:40.921 --> 14:42.965
We do gardening, carpentry, plumbing.

14:43.632 --> 14:46.135
When it comes to painting,
we're regular Leonardos.

14:46.218 --> 14:47.136
[chuckles]

14:47.761 --> 14:51.223
-Best part of all is, we come real cheap.
-Hey, like my marble?

14:51.307 --> 14:54.018
Yeah, nice.
You want me to show you how to shoot?

14:54.101 --> 14:55.019
[Franny] Mm-hmm.

14:55.102 --> 14:58.314
Oh, I forgot to mention
that Cole is the best babysitter in town.

14:58.397 --> 15:01.400
Yeah, I can see that.
Where do you boys live?

15:01.483 --> 15:02.902
In town with our uncle.

15:02.985 --> 15:05.779
We got plenty of references
if that's what you need.

15:05.863 --> 15:07.907
Okay. Do you have a business card?

15:07.990 --> 15:10.618
-A card? Um…
-[Franny and Cole chatting indistinctly]

15:11.118 --> 15:12.369
Let me see.

15:12.453 --> 15:16.040
Oh, I left my business cards at home.
[chuckles]

15:17.207 --> 15:18.751
-I got a pen.
-[Franny] Yeah!

15:19.501 --> 15:21.170
I think we should just hire them.

15:22.004 --> 15:24.173
Shouldn't we get one more quote?

15:24.256 --> 15:26.008
There's a lot of other
groundskeepers in town.

15:26.091 --> 15:27.635
I already did, and they…

15:28.135 --> 15:29.470
run like half the price.

15:32.181 --> 15:35.643
Cath, please don't tell me you're back
on the whole salads-only thing.

15:35.726 --> 15:37.519
I ate a big lunch today.

15:37.603 --> 15:40.230
What about the protein shakes
the doctor recommended?

15:40.773 --> 15:42.483
I saw you skipped it this morning.

15:42.983 --> 15:46.195
I am doing them at night now
because it's easier on my stomach.

15:49.448 --> 15:52.743
-Franny, you want some more rice?
-No, I want a pony ride.

15:52.826 --> 15:53.744
[Catherine laughs]

15:53.827 --> 15:55.788
-[Franny] Go, pony, go!
-[George] I am.

15:55.871 --> 15:57.206
[Franny] Go, pony, go!

15:57.289 --> 15:59.959
[George] You are terrorizing.

16:02.002 --> 16:03.963
Oh, look, there's another pony.

16:04.046 --> 16:05.631
Okay. Ready?

16:05.714 --> 16:07.675

-[Franny] Pony!
-[George] Gosh.

16:15.474 --> 16:18.143
-You coming?
-Yeah, in a second. I have to do dishes.

16:18.227 --> 16:20.479
Oh, can you get that pot for me, please?

16:21.313 --> 16:23.315
-Thank you. I'll be up soon.
-Okay.

16:23.399 --> 16:25.317
Don't be long. I'm pretty tired.

"Damned."

17:33.177 --> 17:34.094
George.

17:34.970 --> 17:35.971
Hey, George.

17:36.055 --> 17:36.889
George.

17:37.639 --> 17:38.766
[George moans]

17:38.849 --> 17:40.726
I'm a-- I'm asleep.

[breathing shakily]

19:25.455 --> 19:27.166
-[woman 1] Where?
-[woman 2] Eight.

19:27.249 --> 19:29.626
-[woman 1] Three pounds is a lot.
-You've got to be telling--

19:29.710 --> 19:30.752
Company.

19:30.836 --> 19:33.172
Hi. Are you the Historical Society?

19:33.714 --> 19:35.132
Indeed we are.

19:35.215 --> 19:38.010
Um, I don't know if you need volunteers,

19:38.093 --> 19:40.721
but I'm new in town,
and I would love to meet people

19:40.804 --> 19:43.390
and possibly learn more about the area.

19:43.473 --> 19:45.350
Write your information down.

19:46.560 --> 19:47.603
Okay.

19:47.686 --> 19:49.771
[blind woman] We'll send you a schedule.

19:49.855 --> 19:52.482
And also, I was curious

19:52.566 --> 19:56.737
if you had any information
on some of the older homes in the area,

19:56.820 --> 19:59.740
being that I just bought one.

20:01.074 --> 20:01.950
Oh.

20:02.951 --> 20:06.997
Actually, there's a picture
of your house hanging up.

20:07.080 --> 20:08.582
-Really? Where?
-Yeah.

20:08.665 --> 20:12.169
In the other room.
The couple who built it is in it, too.

20:12.252 --> 20:14.087
The original ones,

20:14.171 --> 20:16.298
long before the Vayle family.

20:16.381 --> 20:18.884
I… I'm going to go take a look. Thanks.

20:23.096 --> 20:25.724
[women whisper indistinctly]

20:31.271 --> 20:33.273
[suspenseful music playing]

20:53.710 --> 20:56.129
-[Franny] He doesn't look like a cat.
-[George] He does.

20:56.213 --> 20:59.716
-[Franny] His ears are so little.
-[George] It's called Cat in the Hat.

20:59.800 --> 21:03.053
-And his nose and stuff like that.
-He's got a normal nose.

21:03.136 --> 21:05.305
[Franny giggles] But it's so little!

21:15.899 --> 21:17.067
You know he killed someone?

21:19.194 --> 21:20.779
Over a game of tennis.

21:21.780 --> 21:22.614
Who?

21:23.198 --> 21:24.032
Caravaggio.

21:25.450 --> 21:27.411
Oh, well, I'm not surprised.

21:27.494 --> 21:30.247
People get away
with all kinds of horrible things.

21:32.207 --> 21:34.668
Are you speaking from personal experience?

21:34.751 --> 21:35.794
[chuckles]

21:36.670 --> 21:39.965
So are you studying art?
I-I teach over at Saginaw.

21:40.048 --> 21:41.341
Oh God. No.

21:41.425 --> 21:42.718
No, I was just…

21:43.635 --> 21:45.387
looking for T-shirt ideas.

21:45.470 --> 21:47.347
I'm all about literature in school.

21:47.431 --> 21:48.390
Which school?

21:49.099 --> 21:50.100
Cornell.

21:50.684 --> 21:52.769
Oh, that's quite a commute.

21:53.353 --> 21:54.813
Just taking a little hiatus.

21:55.314 --> 21:57.441
Riding for rich folk at Crow Hill Stables.

21:58.108 --> 21:59.318
Yeah, I know that place.

21:59.401 --> 22:02.487
It's right next to the tennis club.
I play there sometimes.

22:02.571 --> 22:04.448
Oh. Well, uh…

22:04.531 --> 22:06.783
I hope you're a better loser
than Caravaggio.

22:09.286 --> 22:10.704
George Claire.

22:11.788 --> 22:12.998
Right.

22:13.081 --> 22:15.083
Right. Claire.

22:15.167 --> 22:17.961
Yeah, my friend Eddie does your yard work.

22:18.754 --> 22:20.672
I think your wife hired him.

22:26.428 --> 22:27.721
Is that your little girl?

22:28.722 --> 22:29.931
Yeah, that's Franny.

22:30.432 --> 22:31.266
Oh…

22:34.561 --> 22:35.771
Hi there, Franny.

22:36.438 --> 22:37.314
How's that book?

22:38.315 --> 22:39.524
What does this say?

22:40.567 --> 22:41.568
Let's see.

22:42.402 --> 22:44.488
Okay, it says…

22:45.864 --> 22:49.284
"He should not be here.
He should not be about."

22:49.368 --> 22:52.788
"He should not be here
when your mother is out."

22:57.584 --> 22:59.086
It's nice to meet you, Franny.

22:59.169 --> 23:00.128
[Franny] Mm-hmm.

23:05.342 --> 23:06.885
[George] Okay, ready to go?

23:08.678 --> 23:09.596
George?

23:12.766 --> 23:13.767
George?

23:13.850 --> 23:15.477
[music playing on TV]

23:18.438 --> 23:20.982
George, you're not going to believe
the picture I just saw.

23:21.066 --> 23:23.068
[water running]

23:27.447 --> 23:28.824
[faint grunting]

[reflective orchestral music playing]

23:40.585 --> 23:42.587
[Cole and Franny chatting indistinctly]

23:52.806 --> 23:55.100
-[Eddie] Wanna go to the pond?
-[Franny] Yeah!

23:55.767 --> 23:57.310
[Eddie] You wanna go swim?

23:58.103 --> 24:00.856
-[Cole] Come on, Franny. Gonna catch you!
-[Franny] No!

24:00.939 --> 24:03.191
-[Cole] I'm gonna throw you in!
-[Franny] No!

24:04.401 --> 24:08.238
[Eddie] Hey Franny, watch out
for the snapping turtles, okay?

24:08.321 --> 24:10.740
All right? It's down my butt!
It's got my butt!

24:10.824 --> 24:14.536
-[Franny laughs]
-Didn't they say summer's officially over?

24:14.619 --> 24:16.872
Our seasons play
by their own rules up here.

24:17.789 --> 24:19.791
Who knows? It could snow tomorrow.

24:21.334 --> 24:24.129
Well, I brought some lemonade
to help you guys cool off,

24:24.212 --> 24:26.465
but it looks like you're way ahead of me.

24:26.548 --> 24:29.342
You should come on in. The water's great.

24:29.926 --> 24:30.886
Believe me,

24:32.137 --> 24:33.680
it looks very tempting.

24:34.181 --> 24:35.891
You know what they say about temptation.

24:37.058 --> 24:39.227
Easiest way to kill it's just to give in.

24:42.105 --> 24:44.107
[Catherine] So what does your uncle do?

24:44.691 --> 24:46.568
He's a hearse driver.

24:47.319 --> 24:49.237
I guess every town needs one of those.

24:51.114 --> 24:52.574
Can I ask about your parents?

24:54.618 --> 24:57.370
Um… both dead. Car accident.

24:58.788 --> 25:00.457
Oh God, I'm so sorry.

25:02.626 --> 25:05.712
Yeah, I mean, it was something.

25:06.630 --> 25:08.089
It makes a kid grow up fast.

25:11.259 --> 25:12.969
Cole's on good track for college, though.

25:13.762 --> 25:14.930
And what about you?

25:15.555 --> 25:17.682
Nah, that stuff's not really in my cards.

25:18.642 --> 25:20.894
I mean, I did want to study music…

25:20.977 --> 25:23.188
-Really? What instruments do you play?
-…but…

25:23.271 --> 25:26.233
All kinds.
I-- I have a beat-up guitar right now.

25:26.316 --> 25:28.777
We have a piano at the house.
I just got it tuned.

25:28.860 --> 25:32.239
It'd be nice to have someone
who can actually play it. I'm pathetic.

25:32.322 --> 25:36.034
[chuckles] All right.
Well, thanks, Mrs. Claire.

25:36.117 --> 25:38.495
-Catherine. Sorry.
-It's okay.

25:39.746 --> 25:41.164
You'll get used to it.

25:41.248 --> 25:44.668
-[students laughing]
-Yeah. Please do not tell him I said that.

25:46.002 --> 25:47.254
All right.

25:48.797 --> 25:50.924
Okay, so,
the Hudson River School painters.

25:51.508 --> 25:54.177
Landscapes as the realm of the soul.

25:54.261 --> 25:58.473
If you keep reading around the subject,
you'll find it really rewarding. Really.

25:58.557 --> 26:00.475
-Keep going, okay?
-Thank you so much.

26:00.559 --> 26:01.768
-We will.
-Bye!

26:01.851 --> 26:03.103
George Claire?

26:03.186 --> 26:05.272
Yes. Hello. Can I help you?

26:05.355 --> 26:08.567
Justine Sokolov.
Adjunct weaving instructor.

26:09.317 --> 26:11.778
You play tennis with my husband Bram.

26:11.861 --> 26:12.988
Bram?

26:13.071 --> 26:16.783
Oh, Bram, of course. Yes.
He mentioned that his wife teaches here.

26:17.534 --> 26:22.247
I hear you've developed a cult-like
following already in our department.

26:22.330 --> 26:23.790
So I… Oh, this you?

26:24.416 --> 26:26.585
I thought I'd invite you
and your wife over

26:26.668 --> 26:28.628
and see what all the fuss is about.

26:29.337 --> 26:30.422
Oh, uh…

26:32.632 --> 26:34.634
That sounds really nice. [chuckles]

26:34.718 --> 26:39.014
You know, it'd be nice for my wife to meet
a few more Saginaw folk, too, so yeah.

26:39.723 --> 26:42.601
Excellent.
I have your number in the registry,

26:42.684 --> 26:44.436
so I'll give the missus a call.

26:44.519 --> 26:46.605
-Fantastic.
-George Claire.

26:47.731 --> 26:49.065
Wow. You painted these?

26:50.066 --> 26:51.860
Yeah, a long time ago.

26:51.943 --> 26:54.654
I gave up the whole fine arts thing
to focus on theory.

26:54.738 --> 26:56.615
Realized I wasn't really up to snuff.

26:56.698 --> 26:57.991
[chuckles]

26:59.200 --> 27:00.118
I disagree.

27:00.660 --> 27:03.580
These are confidently executed,
and they are…

27:04.080 --> 27:04.998
quite unique.

27:06.249 --> 27:07.208
Thank you.

27:07.292 --> 27:10.587
Uh, you should see my wife's stuff.
She's the real artist of the family.

27:10.670 --> 27:12.047
Okay, I look forward to it.

27:12.964 --> 27:14.591
I'll be in touch, George Claire.

27:15.800 --> 27:18.219
[bugs chirping]

27:20.263 --> 27:21.264
[sighs]

27:24.017 --> 27:25.602
[groans] What's wrong?

27:25.685 --> 27:28.188
That smell. It's-- it's getting stronger.

27:28.772 --> 27:31.691
Yeah, I figured it out.
It's 'cause we're above the garage.

27:32.192 --> 27:34.944
I'll get some fans
and air it out in the morning.

27:35.654 --> 27:36.613
[exhales]

27:37.280 --> 27:39.032
But why does it come and go?

27:39.115 --> 27:41.284
Cath, please stop with the ghost stuff.

27:42.577 --> 27:45.914
I'm not gonna let you
put a negative spin on this house.

Mommy, I'm scared, I'm scared!

-Mommy!
-Hey, hey! Shh.

29:07.954 --> 29:10.415
-What happened?
-What is going on? Where were you?

29:10.498 --> 29:13.668
-What happened? Tell me.
-I saw the lady, Mommy. I'm scared.

29:13.752 --> 29:15.920
It's okay, it's okay. Don't worry.

29:16.004 --> 29:19.632
-Mommy's here. You can sleep with us.
-Oh God. Cath, again?

29:20.884 --> 29:24.137
If we filled out her sedative prescription
like the pediatrician said,

29:24.220 --> 29:25.680
this wouldn't keep happening.

29:25.764 --> 29:29.768
I said to you ten times I don't feel good
giving her unnecessary medications.

29:30.560 --> 29:31.561
It's this house.

29:32.520 --> 29:35.315
Oh God. You two sleep in there.
I'll take Franny's room.

29:37.275 --> 29:39.027
Hey. Hey.

29:39.110 --> 29:40.820
Daddy's mad at me.

I guess, yeah.

[laughs]

29:58.129 --> 30:00.632
Uh, guess who I ran into the other day?

30:00.715 --> 30:01.966
Who?

30:02.050 --> 30:04.928
Your boss, George Claire.

30:05.011 --> 30:06.679
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

30:08.014 --> 30:09.891
I haven't met the guy officially yet.

30:11.267 --> 30:12.185
What's he like?

30:13.269 --> 30:15.188
Dishonest.

30:15.271 --> 30:16.606
Deceitful.

30:17.190 --> 30:18.983

30:20.902 --> 30:22.904
Because I found him attractive.

31:36.060 --> 31:38.229
-[chopping wood continues]
-[Catherine] What do you want?

32:10.678 --> 32:13.431
[pensive music playing]

32:15.475 --> 32:16.851
[horse neighs]

32:29.697 --> 32:31.699
[horses neighing and grunting]

32:34.869 --> 32:35.787
[George scoffs]

32:38.665 --> 32:40.416
What are you looking for here?

32:41.167 --> 32:42.585
[pants]

32:42.669 --> 32:45.254
[chuckling] I… I don't really know.

32:53.554 --> 32:55.682
You're a presumptuous fucker, aren't you?

33:02.355 --> 33:04.023
-[door squeaks]
-[horse neighs]

33:12.490 --> 33:15.118
[pensive music continues]

33:28.506 --> 33:31.217
If you're coming in,
shut the door behind you.

33:34.971 --> 33:39.559
He's got a social life at that school,
and I'm isolated.

33:39.642 --> 33:42.520
[woman] Something's wrong.
I can hear it in your voice.

33:42.603 --> 33:43.730
I…

33:45.982 --> 33:49.068
I'm starting… to see things.

33:50.236 --> 33:52.613
And I'm scared to tell George about it.

33:53.531 --> 33:56.159
-Catherine, have you been eating?
-[sighs]

33:56.242 --> 33:59.412
What's the church like up there?
Have you prayed on any of this?

34:00.038 --> 34:02.123
Try to remember
how he did right by marrying--

34:02.206 --> 34:06.002
Oh, I gotta go. Thanks a lot
for the pep talk, Mom. I love you.

34:07.295 --> 34:08.963
[Catherine] That was some run.

34:10.298 --> 34:14.010
Yeah, I guess I went pretty far.
I don't know what came over me.

34:15.011 --> 34:17.764
And then I-I got distracted
by these wildflowers.

34:20.308 --> 34:23.227
Thanks, but now
you're going to be late for class.

34:23.311 --> 34:25.688
Yeah, yeah, I know. I-I'd better hustle.

34:26.773 --> 34:27.774
Whoo!

34:27.899 --> 34:29.067
[running upstairs]

34:37.825 --> 34:39.660
[pensive music playing]

35:08.731 --> 35:09.899
[Cole] Look who's home.

35:11.943 --> 35:12.944
Hey.

35:18.407 --> 35:20.243
-[Cole] What are you doing?
-One sec.

35:21.202 --> 35:22.703
Mr. Claire, right?

35:23.538 --> 35:25.748
It's nice to finally meet you. I'm Eddie.

35:25.832 --> 35:29.168
-My brother and I are about to get--
-The Vayle boys, aren't you?

35:30.795 --> 35:32.171
Not anymore, sir.

35:32.255 --> 35:35.049
We go by Lucks now.
Took our uncle's last name.

35:35.550 --> 35:38.553
Do me a favor. My… my wife
doesn't know that you lived here.

35:38.636 --> 35:40.555
Uh, or what happened.

35:40.638 --> 35:42.932
I think it would be better
if we kept it that way.

35:43.724 --> 35:45.852
Uh, she's a nervous woman and, uh…

35:46.519 --> 35:49.230
well, she wouldn't want you around
if she found out.

35:50.106 --> 35:51.816
[chuckles softly]

35:51.899 --> 35:53.151
Sure, Mr. Claire.

35:55.194 --> 35:57.363
My brother and I are only here
for honest work.

35:57.446 --> 35:58.823
Thank you. I appreciate it.

36:02.118 --> 36:03.119
It seems a…

36:03.870 --> 36:04.745
little odd, no?

36:05.830 --> 36:07.665
That you'd want to be here at all.

36:08.249 --> 36:10.960
Taking care of this house
comes second nature to us.

36:12.420 --> 36:13.588
Right.

36:15.631 --> 36:17.466
Did you meet your husband in art school?

36:18.384 --> 36:20.219
Yeah, we were undergrads together.

36:21.554 --> 36:22.722
That's cool.

36:26.517 --> 36:29.020
[Catherine] Were your parents
supportive of you studying music?

36:29.854 --> 36:31.814
Yeah, my mom was the one who taught me.

36:32.565 --> 36:36.652
But when my father found my application,
he, uh… he beat me with a two-by-four.

36:38.779 --> 36:40.072
Are you serious?

36:40.156 --> 36:41.032
Yeah.

36:42.241 --> 36:44.452
Yeah, he actually
bloodied me up pretty good.

36:48.497 --> 36:51.125
Well, if you decide
to reapply to music school,

36:51.209 --> 36:54.086
I will personally write you
a check for your application.

36:57.548 --> 36:58.382
Wow.

37:00.676 --> 37:01.761
You really got me.

37:02.678 --> 37:05.973
["Someday You'll Be Sorry" 
by Louis Armstrong playing on piano]

37:22.698 --> 37:24.158
-Hey, George.
-[music stops]

37:24.242 --> 37:28.496
Eddie-- Eddie was just playing
his favorite Louis Armstrong song for me.

37:28.579 --> 37:31.290
-Called-- What's it called?
-"Someday You'll Be Sorry."

37:31.374 --> 37:34.293
[chuckling] That's right.
That's the story of my life.

37:35.086 --> 37:36.170
[chuckles]

37:36.837 --> 37:38.256
What a surprise.

37:39.131 --> 37:41.676
Eddie was telling me earlier
how he was here for honest work.

37:41.759 --> 37:44.262
I-- I didn't realize that it included

37:44.845 --> 37:45.805
entertainment.

37:46.931 --> 37:48.474
We finished painting, sir,

37:48.557 --> 37:52.061
and, uh, Mrs. Claire asked me
to play something before I left.

37:52.770 --> 37:54.730
-So--
-Wait, Eddie, Eddie.

37:54.814 --> 37:58.317
Come on, please. Don't stop on my account.

37:58.401 --> 38:01.487
I've been called many things before,
but never a party pooper.

38:04.782 --> 38:06.701
Well, the man of the house has spoken,

38:07.410 --> 38:09.912
so finish the goddamn song, Eddie.

38:11.372 --> 38:12.748
Yeah, please.

38:17.503 --> 38:19.046
[exhales]

[piano playing resumes]

38:40.151 --> 38:42.153
[piano music fades to silence]

38:49.035 --> 38:50.494
Shit.

38:52.955 --> 38:53.914
[sighs]

38:56.751 --> 38:58.878
[uneasy music playing]

39:24.570 --> 39:25.780
Oh God.

40:37.143 --> 40:39.812
[George and girl panting]

40:40.396 --> 40:42.523
[George]
What you do to me, you do not know.

40:43.941 --> 40:45.401
My God.

40:46.902 --> 40:49.488
I've never done
anything like this before, you know.

40:50.364 --> 40:51.449
[exhales loudly]

40:57.830 --> 40:58.664
What's wrong?

41:01.917 --> 41:03.461
What? I'm just talking.

41:04.211 --> 41:07.256
-Sharing.
-What the fuck is wrong with me?

41:07.339 --> 41:10.509
-Why do I keep doing this?
-Hey, Willis, I'm being serious.

41:10.593 --> 41:12.678
It'd be nice to know you a bit better.

41:12.761 --> 41:15.598
Some ordinary, regular things.

41:15.681 --> 41:17.475
That's not what this is about.

41:18.184 --> 41:19.685
Ow! What the hell?

41:19.768 --> 41:22.563
You think because I fuck you,
I'm fooled by you?

41:22.646 --> 41:24.857
I've been around guys like you
my whole life.

41:25.566 --> 41:29.111
-What the hell are you talking about?
-My dad made a fortune defending them.

41:29.195 --> 41:31.989
Thieves, con men, psychopaths.

41:32.072 --> 41:36.368
And they all got off because
that's the way the world works for men.

41:36.452 --> 41:39.705
Okay, look, I see that you have
some pretty awful ideas about men.

41:39.788 --> 41:42.041
I have awful ideas about everything.

41:42.124 --> 41:43.667
Now get the fuck up.

41:43.751 --> 41:45.878
-Come on, Willis.
-No.

41:47.421 --> 41:49.089
I'm done with this.

41:49.173 --> 41:50.216
Willis!

41:50.299 --> 41:51.425
Willis!

41:55.095 --> 41:56.680
[horse neighs]

42:00.100 --> 42:00.976
Willis!

42:03.562 --> 42:06.649
[ethereal music playing]

42:19.078 --> 42:20.746
-[Justine] Hi!
-Trick or treat?

42:20.829 --> 42:21.705
[all chuckle]

42:21.789 --> 42:23.791
-Come in, come in.
-Hello, I'm Catherine.

42:23.874 --> 42:26.335
-Oh, of course you are. Mmm.
-Oh.

42:26.919 --> 42:28.087
[chuckles] George, hi.

42:28.170 --> 42:29.922
-Hi. For you.
-Oh, thank you.

42:30.005 --> 42:32.341
Bram, where are you?
The Claires have arrived.

42:32.424 --> 42:33.676
-Wow.
-[Bram] I'm here.

42:33.759 --> 42:34.760
[George] Amazing.

42:34.843 --> 42:36.095
-[Justine] Thanks.
-Hello.

42:36.178 --> 42:37.555
-I'm Catherine.
-Hey, Bram.

42:37.638 --> 42:39.848
-Thanks for having us.
-Look what they brought us.

42:39.932 --> 42:41.684
-Thank you. How are you?
-Very well.

42:41.767 --> 42:43.018
-Come on in.
-Beautiful.

42:43.102 --> 42:44.728
-Thank you.
-I love your artwork.

42:44.812 --> 42:48.315
Ah. Well, yes. We're just enjoying
our tenure here while it lasts.

42:48.399 --> 42:50.067
-Oh, do you rent?
-No, no, no.

42:50.150 --> 42:53.279
[laughing] He just means
how these old Hudson Valley homes are.

42:53.362 --> 42:55.573
We think we own them,
we're just caretakers.

42:55.656 --> 42:57.324
[laughing] They outlive us all.

42:57.908 --> 43:00.160
My wife thinks ours is haunted.

43:00.244 --> 43:02.121
-Well, she's probably right.
-[laughs]

43:02.204 --> 43:03.581
They're all haunted a bit.

43:03.664 --> 43:06.125
After all,
we're in Headless Horseman country.

43:06.208 --> 43:07.835
[laughs] Let me take your coats.

43:07.918 --> 43:11.755
Oh, actually, we should go outside
and look at the alpacas before they nap.

43:11.839 --> 43:13.841
-Oh, yes.
-This way.

43:13.924 --> 43:15.884
-You'll love it.
-Alpacas nap?

43:17.052 --> 43:19.346
[George] Tell me, Bram. [blows]

43:19.430 --> 43:21.724
Where does one buy
such quality weed up here?

43:21.807 --> 43:24.101
-[Bram] Buy? I grow it.
-[George] Nice.

43:24.768 --> 43:28.480
You know, I came up here
to write the Great American Novel, but…

43:29.273 --> 43:32.693
I spend most of my time
tending to my garden, if you get my drift.

43:32.776 --> 43:33.611
Mm-hmm.

43:33.694 --> 43:35.613
I love your setup. It's amazing.

43:35.696 --> 43:38.157
-Aww, thank you.
-And your work is so unique.

43:38.240 --> 43:40.993
Thanks. It's gonna sound a little strange,

43:41.076 --> 43:44.580
but it's a spiritual thing for me,
weaving.

43:44.663 --> 43:48.542
I tap into something cosmic
when I'm working.

43:48.626 --> 43:50.336
-Its patterns, you know? 
-Yeah.

43:51.086 --> 43:52.880
Sometimes I feel guilty
taking credit for it.

43:52.963 --> 43:54.757
Why? You shouldn't.

43:54.840 --> 43:57.468
I would love for you
to make something for my Franny.

43:57.551 --> 44:00.638
-I'd pay you, naturally.
-Don't be silly. I'll do it for cost.

44:01.263 --> 44:04.516
Oh, actually, George already asked
for a scarf for his mother,

44:04.600 --> 44:06.477
so I'll just add it to that order.

44:06.560 --> 44:07.686
Okay.

44:07.770 --> 44:08.604
Wow.

44:10.189 --> 44:12.941
-You guys just have the one child?
-Yeah. Yes.

44:13.025 --> 44:16.445
She's four. And you and Bram?
Do you guys have kids?

44:17.446 --> 44:18.280
No.

44:19.281 --> 44:20.282
No.

44:21.784 --> 44:25.204
Bram and I were conflicted
about that for a while,

44:26.080 --> 44:28.874
and then Mother Nature
made the final decision.

44:28.957 --> 44:30.626
And she made the right one.

44:31.335 --> 44:33.128
It all worked out perfectly.

44:35.005 --> 44:38.008
I was conflicted, too,
but just like that, it…

44:38.759 --> 44:40.177
It happened.

44:40.260 --> 44:43.681
And then we got married,
which I was also conflicted about.

44:44.932 --> 44:48.143
I guess you could say
I'm a conflicted Catholic girl at heart,

44:48.227 --> 44:50.771
dutifully going through the motions.

44:51.605 --> 44:52.940
You know,

44:53.023 --> 44:55.150
the first few years of our marriage

44:55.984 --> 44:59.988
were a complete blur
because of the baby and school.

45:00.072 --> 45:03.951
We're really still trying
to catch our breath up here.

45:07.996 --> 45:10.916
You know, I attend this women's group.

45:10.999 --> 45:13.085
It's an Arts Club… thing.

45:13.168 --> 45:15.129
We meet once a month up in Albany,

45:15.212 --> 45:19.425
and there are so many
creative ladies to meet, Catherine.

45:20.008 --> 45:21.885
I think you should come with me.

45:22.511 --> 45:24.763
I would love something like that.

45:24.847 --> 45:26.306
I don't know anybody up here.

45:26.390 --> 45:28.016
Well, you do now.

45:32.271 --> 45:35.023
It must be so nice

45:35.107 --> 45:37.317
to inherit a fortune

45:37.401 --> 45:40.529
and then spend all day not writing a book.

45:42.072 --> 45:45.409
I really like them, especially her.
She's so interesting.

45:47.119 --> 45:50.581
She's so free with herself and her body.

45:51.540 --> 45:54.001
She can certainly put away some lasagna.

45:55.085 --> 45:57.963
-That's a nasty thing to say.
-Come on, I'm kidding.

45:58.046 --> 45:59.381
I like them, too.

46:00.382 --> 46:03.343
I especially like…

46:04.511 --> 46:06.555
[sniffs] …Bram's weed.

46:06.638 --> 46:08.098
[sniffs] Mmm.

46:08.182 --> 46:10.934
Are you sure you're okay to drive
after smoking so much?

46:11.018 --> 46:11.935
Yeah.

46:12.686 --> 46:14.980
-I'm fine. I'm more than okay.
-Really?

46:17.232 --> 46:19.401
-Watch this.
-[engine accelerating]

46:19.485 --> 46:21.236
George, slow down.

46:21.320 --> 46:22.821
-Slow down, George.
-Really?

46:22.905 --> 46:24.448
-Really?
-George, slow down!

46:24.531 --> 46:25.824
[yelling] Slow down!

46:26.408 --> 46:28.494
-[Catherine] Stop, George!
-[George] Whoo!

46:28.577 --> 46:30.120
[tires screeching]

46:30.829 --> 46:32.581
God, what the hell are you doing?

46:32.664 --> 46:35.375
What? What, I'm just having a little fun.

46:35.459 --> 46:37.920
You remember what that was like,
Cath, huh?

46:38.003 --> 46:40.506
-That's not funny!
-[laughing] Come on.

46:41.840 --> 46:43.759
Oh, come on, Cath. Cath!

46:47.221 --> 46:48.180
Catherine!

46:48.263 --> 46:51.225
Cath, where are you going?
Come on, get back in the car.

46:51.308 --> 46:53.101
-Cath!
-Get your hands off me!

46:53.644 --> 46:55.270
God, we are two smart people.

46:55.354 --> 46:57.439
-We should've known better.
-Known what?

46:57.523 --> 47:01.026
That I'm only here
for the imaginary book jacket bio

47:01.109 --> 47:03.070
that you have in your fucking head.

47:03.153 --> 47:06.990
The-- the-- the professor
with the wife and the country home.

47:07.074 --> 47:08.742
I gave up everything for you!

47:08.826 --> 47:10.369
Oh God, I'm so sorry.

47:10.452 --> 47:12.746
I'm so sorry
I fucked up both of our lives!

47:12.830 --> 47:15.916
And the worst part is this is all I have.

47:15.999 --> 47:18.836
Cath, you know what you do have?
Is the crying drunks.

47:18.919 --> 47:21.797
You are a person
who should not drink alcohol,

47:21.880 --> 47:24.383
especially when you do not
fucking eat anything!

47:24.466 --> 47:28.011
Oh my God. I am so sick
of everybody blaming everything

47:28.095 --> 47:30.806
in my fucking life on me not eating!

47:30.889 --> 47:33.225
Please, get back in the goddamn car!

47:33.308 --> 47:35.102
-Get off of me!
-[cries out] Ow!

47:35.185 --> 47:36.395
Fuck!

47:36.478 --> 47:38.438
-[groans]
-Oh my God. Cath?

47:38.522 --> 47:40.107
[Catherine whimpering]

47:40.190 --> 47:41.483
Oh my God. Cath…

47:41.567 --> 47:43.735
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
Was that…

47:43.819 --> 47:44.903
Did I… Did I…

47:53.078 --> 47:53.996
Cath?

47:56.582 --> 47:57.833
Cath, are you okay?

47:57.916 --> 47:59.126
[car door opens]

48:00.294 --> 48:01.128
[car door slams]

48:01.712 --> 48:03.463
[door opens]

48:09.595 --> 48:10.429
[door closes]

48:13.599 --> 48:15.726
Come on, Cole. Get up.
I'll drive you home.

48:21.231 --> 48:22.190
[door closes]

48:24.067 --> 48:25.527
[footsteps]

48:40.417 --> 48:41.627
[George] Hey, Cath?

48:44.338 --> 48:45.672
I didn't mean to hurt you.

48:46.673 --> 48:47.591
[sighs]

48:50.719 --> 48:52.554
I would never hurt you.

48:55.265 --> 48:57.559
But I also…

48:58.810 --> 49:02.230
I have not been sensitive
to your needs for some time.

49:03.982 --> 49:06.109
And for that, I owe you an apology.

49:07.486 --> 49:08.862
More than an apology.

49:08.946 --> 49:10.530
[electricity buzzing]

49:11.114 --> 49:12.574
One thing I do know…

49:14.618 --> 49:16.119
[voice breaks] …is I love you.

49:16.203 --> 49:17.704
-[buzzing]
-[Franny screams]

49:17.788 --> 49:19.873
-[glass shatters]
-[Franny] What was that?

49:19.957 --> 49:21.333
Oh God. Jesus. What?

49:22.125 --> 49:23.961
[Catherine] It's okay, baby.

49:24.044 --> 49:27.047
[whispering]
Nothing happened. It's okay. It's okay.

49:31.343 --> 49:33.804
[ethereal music playing]

49:41.728 --> 49:45.816
[woman] "We look at each other,
and we are not ashamed."

49:45.899 --> 49:50.320
"I wearing the face
of the proper marriage,

49:50.404 --> 49:54.032
you the face of the independent woman."

49:55.075 --> 49:58.412
"We cleaved to each other
across that space."

50:05.085 --> 50:07.754
[door opens and closes]

50:12.926 --> 50:14.636
[George] You're back later than I thought.

50:14.720 --> 50:15.595
Am I?

50:16.805 --> 50:18.015
The fridge is empty.

50:18.932 --> 50:21.727
I can go out, pick up some food for us.

50:22.894 --> 50:26.440
-What do you feel like?
-I, uh… I ate with Justine.

50:37.492 --> 50:38.910
-[keys jangle]
-[door closes]

50:38.994 --> 50:41.496
[car engine idling]

50:57.262 --> 51:00.015
[George] Brilliant setting
for a faculty meeting, Floyd.

51:00.098 --> 51:04.186
[Floyd] Yes. I take her out alone a lot,
which would seem selfish.

51:04.269 --> 51:05.520
[George chuckles]

51:05.604 --> 51:08.982
I used to sail a bit myself.
Grew up on the Connecticut coast.

51:09.066 --> 51:11.777
Oh, that's right.
Do your family own a boat?

51:12.360 --> 51:15.238
I inherited my cousin's. The Lost Horizon.

51:15.322 --> 51:16.156
[Floyd] Ah.

51:17.449 --> 51:19.701
He actually drowned while sailing it.

51:19.785 --> 51:21.286
Oh, how sad.

51:22.370 --> 51:23.205
Yeah.

51:23.789 --> 51:24.664
Only 19.

51:24.748 --> 51:27.084
-Mm.
-Already so sophisticated.

51:27.167 --> 51:28.126
[Floyd sighs]

51:28.210 --> 51:29.795
I remember when he died.

51:31.254 --> 51:35.175
I stole his diary after the funeral.
Read it repeatedly.

51:37.052 --> 51:39.221
I know it's-- it's an awful thing to do,

51:39.304 --> 51:42.474
but I… I think I needed some sort of…

51:42.557 --> 51:43.642
connection.

51:45.185 --> 51:46.853
Did you learn anything from it?

51:48.146 --> 51:49.439
Yeah, a little.

51:50.190 --> 51:52.484
He was gay, unhappy.

51:53.193 --> 51:54.903
Typical tortured artist.

51:55.946 --> 51:57.405
And then all that angst

51:58.073 --> 52:00.826
one unfortunate moment vanishes forever.

52:04.079 --> 52:05.914
We're all so inconsequential, Floyd.

52:07.833 --> 52:10.502
Swedenborg would suggest otherwise.

52:11.336 --> 52:13.922
He'd say death is only the beginning.

52:15.841 --> 52:17.259
Have you read the book yet?

52:17.342 --> 52:18.718
[chuckles]

52:19.302 --> 52:21.012
[George] It's on the top of my list.

52:26.685 --> 52:27.519
[door opens]

52:27.644 --> 52:29.229
-[George] Come, come in.
-Ahh.

52:29.312 --> 52:30.564
Cath?

52:30.647 --> 52:31.982
Let me get that.

52:33.733 --> 52:34.776
Hello.

52:34.860 --> 52:37.988
Oh, Catherine, this is Floyd DeBeers,
head of our department.

52:38.071 --> 52:40.323
He also took me
on this magnificent boat ride.

52:40.407 --> 52:41.741
So good to meet you.

52:41.825 --> 52:45.412
So, in return, I invited him to our house,
a very unfair trade.

52:45.495 --> 52:48.331
-I've heard wonderful things about you.
-As I have you.

52:48.415 --> 52:49.499
[Catherine chuckles]

52:49.583 --> 52:52.294
George, is this some kind of setup?

52:52.377 --> 52:54.504
[Catherine chuckles] What?

52:55.547 --> 52:59.176
[chuckling] I-- I swear to God,
I didn't even tell her you were coming.

52:59.259 --> 53:02.179
You see, George? You see?
There are no coincidences.

53:02.262 --> 53:05.849
I'm sorry. I-- I was taken by the artwork
and just started reading it.

53:05.932 --> 53:07.601
[George] Nothing to be sorry for.

53:07.684 --> 53:10.645
You do know what this is, don't you?
The cover art?

53:11.897 --> 53:15.233
It's a soul
transitioning into the afterlife.

53:15.317 --> 53:16.484
[Catherine] Really?

53:16.568 --> 53:18.570
[Floyd] The painter followed Swedenborg,

53:18.653 --> 53:22.449
so he believed that death
is parallel to birth, but divine.

53:22.532 --> 53:24.659
[George] Floyd, believe me.

53:24.743 --> 53:29.247
You do not want to get
my wife started on all that, uh, stuff.

53:29.331 --> 53:33.168
[chuckles awkwardly]
Uh, Cath, please show Floyd around.

53:33.251 --> 53:35.253
Um, I'm gonna fix us some cocktails.

53:36.254 --> 53:38.006
May I show you around?

53:38.089 --> 53:39.257
-I can't wait.
-Great.

53:39.341 --> 53:40.175
[both chuckle]

53:41.509 --> 53:43.470
My daughter's asleep already,

53:43.553 --> 53:45.764
but you can-- we can peek in her room.

53:45.847 --> 53:48.808
We actually have four bedrooms,
but we only use two of them.

53:48.892 --> 53:51.269
A young couple can't have too many bed--

53:53.730 --> 53:55.190
You okay?

53:55.273 --> 53:56.858
Shh.

53:59.027 --> 54:00.654
[whispering] We're not alone, are we?

54:02.572 --> 54:04.115
What do you mean?

54:05.951 --> 54:07.827
She doesn't mean any harm.

54:08.703 --> 54:10.664
She has reasons for lingering.

54:14.376 --> 54:17.379
[whispering]
I've seen her, and so has my daughter.

54:18.588 --> 54:20.465
Because she's here for you.

54:21.174 --> 54:23.009
-She wants you to know that.
-[cries]

54:23.718 --> 54:26.513
At first, I was terrified,

54:26.596 --> 54:28.223
of course, but now…

54:30.225 --> 54:33.561
every time I sense her, I-- I feel…

54:35.563 --> 54:36.648
comfort.

54:36.731 --> 54:40.610
-I know that doesn't make any sense.
-It makes perfect sense.

54:40.694 --> 54:41.987
[crying]

54:43.321 --> 54:44.489
[Floyd shushes gently]

54:45.365 --> 54:47.492
Her name is Smit, wife of Jacob Smit.

54:47.575 --> 54:50.578
He was a… um, a local minister.

54:50.662 --> 54:54.291
They built this house,
and that's all I can find at the library.

54:54.374 --> 54:56.584
Let me do some digging on campus.

54:56.668 --> 54:58.837
You can't tell George
because he can't know.

54:58.920 --> 55:00.171
He thinks that I'm crazy.

55:00.255 --> 55:02.007
No, of course not.

55:02.090 --> 55:03.967
He's just afraid, you know.

55:04.050 --> 55:06.428
Men at his stage of life often are.

55:06.511 --> 55:09.347
But try and be patient, Catherine.

55:09.431 --> 55:12.392
With love,
he can catch up to you spiritually.

55:13.435 --> 55:15.186
And let us…

55:15.270 --> 55:17.897
Let us hold a séance here.

55:18.690 --> 55:21.067
-With or without George.
-Really?

55:21.151 --> 55:24.112
We can find out
a little more about your housemate.

55:24.863 --> 55:26.323
[George] Bye, Floyd.

55:26.406 --> 55:29.743
Good night, good night,
and thanks for a wonderful evening.

55:30.243 --> 55:31.453
[George] Drive safe.

55:34.497 --> 55:38.209
My God, Cath, he absolutely adored you.

55:38.293 --> 55:41.963
I-- I have never seen Floyd
light up like that around anyone.

55:43.882 --> 55:47.010
And you were up there awhile.
Did he say anything?

55:48.762 --> 55:49.596
About what?

55:49.679 --> 55:51.389
About me?

55:52.098 --> 55:53.183
Oh.

55:55.101 --> 55:57.937
He said that you were
an exceptional professor.

55:59.022 --> 56:00.023
[sighs]

56:00.106 --> 56:03.401
And you are an exceptional wife,

56:03.485 --> 56:05.528
which means the world to me.

56:05.612 --> 56:06.446
[kisses]

56:09.115 --> 56:12.327
Ah! I feel like having company
was good for us.

56:12.410 --> 56:13.995
Yeah? We need this.

56:15.997 --> 56:19.000
I, uh…
I want to invite my whole department over.

56:19.084 --> 56:20.960
A-- a real party. What do you think?

56:21.920 --> 56:23.505
[sighs]

56:23.588 --> 56:27.801
I think we owe it to Franny
to make this place a happy home.

56:29.469 --> 56:33.598
I'm not against it. I just think
that we need to then also invite

56:33.681 --> 56:35.683
the locals and our neighbors.

56:39.896 --> 56:41.856
Neighbors? [chuckles] Really?

56:41.940 --> 56:45.985
I need to feel like I'm in this community,
George, not just your community.

56:49.072 --> 56:50.490
Okay, let's do it.

56:51.282 --> 56:53.410
[jazzy piano music playing]

56:53.993 --> 56:56.496
Please tell me again
why I'm carrying a Bundt cake.

56:56.579 --> 56:57.664
[laughs]

56:57.747 --> 56:59.416
We're no good at parties.

56:59.499 --> 57:00.875
Speak for yourself.

57:00.959 --> 57:04.254
I am. Nobody wants the sheriff around
when they're drunk.

57:05.130 --> 57:07.799
-[piano music continues]
-[indistinct chattering]

57:09.926 --> 57:11.344
Uh, more wine?

57:15.390 --> 57:16.933
Hi. Wine?

57:17.016 --> 57:18.977
A little. Just… just…

57:19.602 --> 57:21.229
Oh! Okay, good.

57:22.147 --> 57:24.107
She's a friend of Bram's.

57:24.190 --> 57:26.401
She's also writing.

57:27.735 --> 57:31.614
They both have been writing novels… Sorry.
They both have been writing novels.

57:31.698 --> 57:33.908
I first wore glasses when I was 13.

57:33.992 --> 57:36.369
Oh, thank you. Thank you, young man.

57:36.453 --> 57:39.372
Yes. You've done a lot with this place.

57:45.753 --> 57:48.840
I want you to meet my wife Millicent,
the love of my life.

57:48.923 --> 57:50.592
It's incredibly nice to meet you.

57:50.675 --> 57:53.595
I hear we might have
a session in your home.

57:53.678 --> 57:55.180
Yeah, soon, I hope. Thank you.

57:55.263 --> 57:58.057
George? Travis, Mare's husband.

57:58.141 --> 58:00.727
-A pleasure to meet you.
-This is her best cake.

58:00.810 --> 58:02.187
[laughing] Oh, wow.

58:02.270 --> 58:04.397
Thank you. We'll put it right here.

58:04.481 --> 58:06.941
[Mare] Travis? Come here.
You've got to hear this.

58:07.025 --> 58:07.984
Yes, dear.

58:09.277 --> 58:11.863
Hm. I almost baked a cake.

58:13.031 --> 58:16.868
Bram insisted there was something
you might appreciate… even more.

58:17.660 --> 58:19.412
Oh… [chuckles]

58:19.496 --> 58:21.664
[sniffs] Oh, fantastic.

58:21.748 --> 58:23.791
-[chuckles]
-Um, shall we?

58:23.875 --> 58:25.585
-Yeah. Why not?
-Why not?

58:25.668 --> 58:29.047
-This place looks marvelous, Catherine.
-Thank you.

58:29.130 --> 58:31.090
Absolutely transformed.

58:31.174 --> 58:34.719
Well, a little paint
goes a really long way.

58:36.346 --> 58:39.349
[sighs] And it does my heart good
to see Eddie and Cole here.

58:39.432 --> 58:42.685
-You're a saint for having them back.
-What do you mean?

58:43.853 --> 58:45.104
Well, they grew up here.

58:47.899 --> 58:50.068
You-- you knew that, didn't you?

58:51.611 --> 58:53.738
I-I-It's just that

58:53.821 --> 58:57.951
I told George the whole story
when I first showed him the house and--

58:58.034 --> 58:59.536
What story?

59:00.745 --> 59:03.873
I suppose he-- he didn't wanna upset you.

59:04.499 --> 59:08.169
-I-- I'm going to go find Travis.
-No, no, no. What story, Mare?

59:11.256 --> 59:13.424
He didn't tell you anything
about their parents?

59:13.508 --> 59:14.342
Hm-mm.

59:14.425 --> 59:18.054
[sighs] Well… it's just that…

59:19.973 --> 59:23.142
Dear Ella, she was a friend of mine,
you know, and… and…

59:24.185 --> 59:27.355
Sometimes, I can't help
but believe that she…

59:28.565 --> 59:29.399
She's free now.

59:29.482 --> 59:32.151
And-- and I know he struggled financially,

59:32.235 --> 59:36.864
but that horrible man was cruel in--
in ways that you could never know.

59:36.948 --> 59:38.074
What happened to them?

59:39.117 --> 59:42.203
Catherine, it's not the time.
I don't want to ruin your party.

59:42.287 --> 59:43.204
No, no.

59:44.414 --> 59:46.708
Mare, I'm begging you.
I need to know this.

59:48.334 --> 59:49.669
[sighs]

59:49.752 --> 59:50.587
All right.

59:51.421 --> 59:53.298
The way I… I heard it

59:54.549 --> 59:55.425
was that…

59:56.134 --> 59:57.802
Calvin Vayle

59:57.885 --> 59:59.887
slipped Ella and the boys

1:00:00.555 --> 1:00:01.639
a sedative one night.

1:00:01.723 --> 1:00:02.557
And…

1:00:03.141 --> 1:00:04.851
when they were out cold, he…

1:00:05.602 --> 1:00:09.480
He went outside and shot
every one of the cows they owned.

1:00:09.564 --> 1:00:10.732
Oh my God.

1:00:12.191 --> 1:00:16.529
And then, when he was finished,
he went into the garage below their…

1:00:17.113 --> 1:00:18.656
bedroom,

1:00:18.740 --> 1:00:22.410
started the ignition of two trucks
and closed the windows.

1:00:22.493 --> 1:00:24.037
The fumes.

1:00:24.120 --> 1:00:25.788
Then he went up and…

1:00:26.789 --> 1:00:29.375
laid down in bed with Ella until--

1:00:29.459 --> 1:00:32.045
-Oh my God, I was wrong.
-They never woke up.

1:00:32.128 --> 1:00:33.588
I had the wrong wife.

1:00:33.671 --> 1:00:34.505
I--

1:00:34.589 --> 1:00:37.800
-Wrong about what?
-Your friend Ella. She's here, Mare.

1:00:37.884 --> 1:00:39.886
Oh my God. Where did you get this?

1:00:39.969 --> 1:00:41.804
Wh-what are you doing with this?

1:00:41.888 --> 1:00:43.348
She never took this ring off.

1:00:43.431 --> 1:00:44.265
You know what?

1:00:44.349 --> 1:00:48.269
I've been in this house for three months,
and nobody has said anything to me.

1:00:48.353 --> 1:00:51.648
Not the mailman,
not a neighbor, not-- not the bank teller.

1:00:51.731 --> 1:00:53.650
God, I'm such a fool!

1:00:53.733 --> 1:00:55.485
No, no, it's not like that.

1:00:55.568 --> 1:00:58.446
-Oh my God!
-Catherine, we're from farm stock up here.

1:00:58.529 --> 1:01:02.533
It's-- it's not our way to get involved
with people's personal business.

1:01:02.617 --> 1:01:05.411
You've made this home
so warm and inviting,

1:01:05.495 --> 1:01:08.915
and everyone's moved on so well.
I'm sure that George didn't mean--

1:01:08.998 --> 1:01:11.376
Do not waste any of your time
on George, Mare.

1:01:13.836 --> 1:01:16.798
George Claire always gets
exactly what he wants.

1:01:19.634 --> 1:01:22.970
[George] Justine, tell me something
about you I don't know. [blows]

1:01:23.846 --> 1:01:27.266
You don't know anything about me.

1:01:28.476 --> 1:01:29.727
I do.

1:01:31.229 --> 1:01:33.439
I know you're a weaver

1:01:34.148 --> 1:01:35.400
of fabrics.

1:01:36.526 --> 1:01:37.360
Huh?

1:01:38.277 --> 1:01:40.571
And ideas.

1:01:41.781 --> 1:01:44.450
Like the ideas you've been putting
in my wife's head lately.

1:01:45.159 --> 1:01:46.619
-Mm.
-[George] Mm-hmm.

1:01:46.703 --> 1:01:47.912
-Mm.
-[George chuckles]

1:01:48.746 --> 1:01:49.831
Okay.

1:01:51.499 --> 1:01:53.626
Here's something about me you don't know.

1:01:55.378 --> 1:01:57.463
I get suspicious

1:01:57.547 --> 1:02:00.550
when students worship their professors.

1:02:01.426 --> 1:02:02.927
Always leads to trouble.

1:02:03.010 --> 1:02:04.595
[chuckles]

1:02:04.679 --> 1:02:06.472
Is that a dig or advice?

1:02:06.556 --> 1:02:10.226
Oh, it's just honesty.
You know, like the Good Book says.

1:02:10.309 --> 1:02:12.520
"The truth will set you free."

1:02:13.771 --> 1:02:15.398
I don't know about that.

1:02:15.481 --> 1:02:17.358
People really don't want the truth,

1:02:17.442 --> 1:02:19.819
and they certainly
don't want to be set free.

1:02:20.945 --> 1:02:22.113
What? Says who?

1:02:22.196 --> 1:02:24.073
The Eagles, remember?

1:02:24.157 --> 1:02:25.825
-"Hotel California."
-[Justine laughs]

1:02:25.908 --> 1:02:29.454
Yeah. We, uh--
we all choose our own prison.

1:02:30.455 --> 1:02:32.790
Here, give me your hands.

1:02:34.000 --> 1:02:36.169
I'll show you why they're right.
Here.

1:02:36.252 --> 1:02:38.504
-You're going to read my palms now?
-Come on.

1:02:40.131 --> 1:02:41.257
[Justine sighs]

1:02:41.841 --> 1:02:42.967
[George clears throat]

1:02:44.010 --> 1:02:45.011
[George exhales]

1:02:47.263 --> 1:02:48.264
Okay.

1:02:49.682 --> 1:02:50.725
Now,

1:02:52.059 --> 1:02:53.644
try to get yourself free.

1:03:05.823 --> 1:03:09.118
[grunts] Okay, that's enough.
You can let go now, George.

1:03:09.619 --> 1:03:12.997
Yeah, I know I can,
but are you sure you really want me to?

1:03:14.290 --> 1:03:15.875
-I'm very sure.
-Oh.

1:03:17.043 --> 1:03:17.877
[laughs]

1:03:20.463 --> 1:03:23.132
George, you-- you are hurting me now.

1:03:23.216 --> 1:03:24.050
Let go!

1:03:24.967 --> 1:03:26.260
[laughing]

1:03:27.261 --> 1:03:28.554
W-what?

1:03:29.931 --> 1:03:32.433
-[laughing]
-Jesus Christ, George.

1:03:35.228 --> 1:03:37.146
Hotel California, Justine.

1:03:38.189 --> 1:03:40.024
Hotel California!

1:03:40.525 --> 1:03:42.026
[laughs]

1:03:43.027 --> 1:03:44.612
[George] Good night.

1:03:44.695 --> 1:03:46.030
-Drive safe.
-[door closes]

1:03:50.243 --> 1:03:51.244
Whoo!

1:03:52.912 --> 1:03:53.913
Well,

1:03:54.914 --> 1:03:57.124
that was a success, huh?

1:04:01.921 --> 1:04:03.005
[dishes clattering]

1:04:04.465 --> 1:04:07.051
Your friend Justine
is a bit of a head case.

1:04:07.134 --> 1:04:09.554
Is she trying to start
some trouble or something?

1:04:10.137 --> 1:04:11.931
No, I didn't see Justine all night,

1:04:12.598 --> 1:04:14.642
but it's interesting that you ask.

1:04:19.564 --> 1:04:21.774
Know what's interesting to me?

1:04:22.859 --> 1:04:27.071
Is that this party was supposed
to bring you and me together,

1:04:27.154 --> 1:04:29.448
and as soon as everyone leaves,

1:04:29.532 --> 1:04:31.409
you retreat and ice up.

1:04:33.077 --> 1:04:35.830
How could you not tell me
about this house, George?

1:04:38.124 --> 1:04:39.834
[George sighs] Jesus.

1:04:43.504 --> 1:04:45.965
[sighs] I was afraid this might happen.

1:04:46.048 --> 1:04:48.301
That one of your lies would be exposed?

1:04:49.051 --> 1:04:53.431
I wasn't lying to you, Cath. I was trying
to spare you some unpleasantness.

1:04:53.514 --> 1:04:58.144
I can handle unpleasantness, George, okay?
I lived through childbirth, remember?

1:04:58.227 --> 1:05:00.229
I was trying to protect you.

1:05:00.313 --> 1:05:04.150
Believe-- believe it or not,
I-I actually wanted you to be happy here.

1:05:04.233 --> 1:05:06.694
[loud radio static]

1:05:06.777 --> 1:05:08.279
[cacophony of voices on radio]

1:05:12.658 --> 1:05:14.118
What the fuck is that?

1:05:16.287 --> 1:05:17.914
[radio static continues]

1:05:17.997 --> 1:05:19.790
Fucking electricity in this house!

1:05:23.044 --> 1:05:24.837
[radio static continues loudly]

1:05:25.421 --> 1:05:26.422
[George] What the…

1:05:28.758 --> 1:05:30.968
[static and voices continue]

1:05:32.053 --> 1:05:33.638
The fuck is going on?

1:05:35.973 --> 1:05:37.475
[radio silences]

1:05:42.939 --> 1:05:45.274
Franny's overdue
for a visit with your parents.

1:05:45.358 --> 1:05:47.401
You can finish off the weekend there.

1:05:50.863 --> 1:05:54.075
[somber music playing]

1:05:54.158 --> 1:05:56.160
[printer whirring]

1:06:04.835 --> 1:06:07.421
-[answering machine beeps]
-Floyd, it's Catherine.

1:06:08.673 --> 1:06:09.966
I'm ready.

1:06:11.592 --> 1:06:14.553
This is her. This is Ella Vayle,

1:06:15.972 --> 1:06:20.226
and this is the article
I found about her death.

1:06:20.309 --> 1:06:23.312
But she's trying to…

1:06:23.396 --> 1:06:26.065
She's reaching out to me,
and I-I need to know why.

1:06:26.148 --> 1:06:30.069
You're saying the spirit
is the most recent resident of your house?

1:06:30.152 --> 1:06:32.071
Yes. I was confused before.

1:06:32.154 --> 1:06:36.659
Well, my research turned up something
interesting about the original owners,

1:06:37.243 --> 1:06:39.245
especially for our group here.

1:06:40.204 --> 1:06:41.539
What? The Smits?

1:06:42.248 --> 1:06:44.125
Reverend Smit's wife

1:06:44.208 --> 1:06:47.169
was an early devotee of Swedenborg.

1:06:47.253 --> 1:06:48.587
[group murmurs]

1:06:48.671 --> 1:06:51.507
[Floyd] Unfortunately,
it was not a happy marriage.

1:06:51.590 --> 1:06:54.301
Smit was a strict Calvinist

1:06:54.385 --> 1:06:58.139
who strongly disapproved
of his wife's philosophic exploration.

1:06:58.222 --> 1:06:59.056
"Damned."

1:06:59.140 --> 1:07:01.100
[Floyd] She died in their home

1:07:01.183 --> 1:07:04.603
rather mysteriously at age 26.

1:07:04.687 --> 1:07:06.981
So much death in my house.

1:07:07.064 --> 1:07:09.859
Oh, no, no. Don't think of it that way.

1:07:09.942 --> 1:07:13.696
We embrace inhabited houses as a blessing.

1:07:13.779 --> 1:07:16.657
-[Floyd] Mm.
-[Millicent] Portals between two realms

1:07:16.741 --> 1:07:20.369
with guides to shepherd us
once our own time comes.

1:07:20.453 --> 1:07:22.705
Some religions call them guardian angels.

1:07:22.788 --> 1:07:26.000
Perhaps it's our Swedenborgian friend
who first opened the portal door.

1:07:26.083 --> 1:07:27.293
We are good at that.

1:07:27.376 --> 1:07:28.502
[all laughing]

1:07:29.086 --> 1:07:33.007
[Millicent] Because it's the afterlife
where we reach our greatest purpose.

1:07:33.090 --> 1:07:36.886
[laughs] You never see these spirits
as potentially evil?

1:07:36.969 --> 1:07:41.140
An evil spirit
will only commune with an evil-doer.

1:07:41.223 --> 1:07:43.976
[Floyd] Which we will take,
on a leap of faith, that you're not.

1:07:44.060 --> 1:07:46.312
-[group laughs]
-[local man] And remember.

1:07:46.395 --> 1:07:49.315
Evil only thrives
in the house where it is welcome.

1:07:49.398 --> 1:07:51.817
-[Floyd] Mm.
-[local woman] Goodness always triumphs.

1:07:51.901 --> 1:07:54.779
Always.
If not in this world, then in the next.

1:07:55.613 --> 1:07:56.989
[Floyd] We should start,

1:07:57.073 --> 1:07:57.907
yes?

1:07:59.241 --> 1:08:01.327
Let whomever the spirit is

1:08:02.369 --> 1:08:04.371
speak for herself.

1:08:23.265 --> 1:08:26.519
[tense music plays]

1:08:39.031 --> 1:08:41.450
[electricity buzzing]

1:08:46.831 --> 1:08:47.832
[woman gasps]

1:08:47.915 --> 1:08:49.458
[table vibrating]

1:08:50.876 --> 1:08:52.336
[group screams]

1:08:52.419 --> 1:08:54.421
[ghostly wind shrieking]

1:08:59.593 --> 1:09:01.637
[ghostly voice] As evil comes to light,

1:09:02.304 --> 1:09:03.597
beware!

1:09:04.431 --> 1:09:08.435
[Floyd] She's making her presence known.
We welcome her, don't we, Catherine?

1:09:08.519 --> 1:09:10.312
We do. We… I-- I do.

1:09:10.896 --> 1:09:12.773
[ghostly voice 2] Get back here!

1:09:12.857 --> 1:09:14.567
-[ghostly voice] No!
-[ghostly voice 2] Ella.

1:09:14.650 --> 1:09:15.776
[ghostly voices grunting]

1:09:15.860 --> 1:09:18.320
-[Catherine] What happened?
-[Floyd] She wants to break through.

1:09:18.404 --> 1:09:19.321
She's trying.

1:09:19.405 --> 1:09:21.949
But something, someone is stopping her.

1:09:22.992 --> 1:09:24.910
[ghostly voice] You're suffocating me!

1:09:24.994 --> 1:09:26.120
[group yells]

1:09:29.039 --> 1:09:31.375
[Catherine] What was that? Oh my God.

1:09:45.389 --> 1:09:48.142
I'm afraid this home has another spirit.

1:09:49.935 --> 1:09:52.730
And until that spirit reveals its nature,

1:09:54.398 --> 1:09:57.193
be careful of those around you, Catherine.

1:10:01.071 --> 1:10:02.656
-[Franny] Mama, Mama!
-Hi, baby.

1:10:02.740 --> 1:10:05.451
Come here. Did you have fun
at Grandma and Grandpa's house?

1:10:05.534 --> 1:10:08.454
-Yeah.
-Did you look for seashells on the beach?

1:10:08.537 --> 1:10:10.748
-Mm-hmm.
-Really? Are they pretty?

1:10:10.831 --> 1:10:11.707
Yeah!

1:10:11.790 --> 1:10:13.500
Keep moving, everyone. Hustle.

1:10:13.584 --> 1:10:16.670
We don't wanna get caught in traffic
on the way into the city.

1:10:16.754 --> 1:10:18.422
Nearly there, nearly full.

1:10:19.590 --> 1:10:21.508
Tommy, good. Thank you for com--

1:10:22.927 --> 1:10:24.345
-Justine.
-George.

1:10:25.179 --> 1:10:27.514
I, uh, I didn't know you were joining us.

1:10:28.057 --> 1:10:30.017
Floyd wanted an additional chaperone.

1:10:30.100 --> 1:10:31.393
[engine turns over]

1:10:32.353 --> 1:10:33.479
[student] I'm here!

1:10:34.563 --> 1:10:36.565
Right, Katie. You're the last.

1:10:40.277 --> 1:10:41.737
[Franny] Where are we going?

1:10:42.321 --> 1:10:44.573
Get in the car, baby.
I'll be there in a sec.

1:10:48.202 --> 1:10:49.203
Eddie!

1:10:50.204 --> 1:10:52.164
There's something
I have to give you that I, uh…

1:10:53.374 --> 1:10:56.669
found in the house a while back
before I learned the truth.

1:11:01.006 --> 1:11:03.092
It's a little bit tight on me.

1:11:03.759 --> 1:11:06.637
-Just leave it.
-No, no, it belongs to you and Cole.

1:11:06.720 --> 1:11:08.639
She would want you to have this.

1:11:09.306 --> 1:11:10.432
I don't want it.

1:11:12.351 --> 1:11:14.812
I noticed it on you a couple weeks ago.

1:11:17.189 --> 1:11:18.065
Um…

1:11:19.108 --> 1:11:20.192
It just seemed right.

1:11:23.237 --> 1:11:25.239
You and Mom would have liked each other.

1:11:33.580 --> 1:11:34.957
[horn honks]

1:11:44.967 --> 1:11:46.593
Three on the bottom are on time.

1:11:46.677 --> 1:11:50.431
I found that overdue one
in my husband's car, I can pay the fine.

1:11:50.514 --> 1:11:52.558
It's just on his card.

1:11:52.641 --> 1:11:55.728
Actually, this one's checked out
under the name Willis Howell.

1:11:57.187 --> 1:11:58.939
Oh, that's odd.

1:12:00.816 --> 1:12:02.443
It's unisex, you know?

1:12:03.819 --> 1:12:04.653
Excuse me?

1:12:04.737 --> 1:12:06.780
The name, Willis.

1:12:07.573 --> 1:12:08.741
She's a pretty thing.

1:12:09.325 --> 1:12:10.951
In here a lot on weekends.

1:12:11.035 --> 1:12:12.161
Daddy's friend.

1:12:15.289 --> 1:12:17.499
Don't worry. I'll ask her to pay the fine.

1:12:20.252 --> 1:12:22.379
I'd like to open a new account.

1:12:23.714 --> 1:12:25.049
Of course, Mrs. Claire.

1:12:25.132 --> 1:12:28.260
Uh, just… just fill out, um,

1:12:28.344 --> 1:12:29.553
this form.

1:12:32.431 --> 1:12:35.976
Uh, we will require George's signature
if it's a joint account.

1:12:36.060 --> 1:12:37.019
It's not.

1:12:38.854 --> 1:12:40.856
[traffic sounds]

1:12:46.779 --> 1:12:48.781
[George] Okay, everyone. Here we are.

1:13:04.004 --> 1:13:05.798
[man] George Claire?

1:13:05.881 --> 1:13:08.050
[chuckles] Good God.

1:13:09.635 --> 1:13:11.762
Dr. Warren. Wow. [chuckles]

1:13:11.845 --> 1:13:13.180
What an odd coincidence.

1:13:13.263 --> 1:13:14.431
Odd indeed.

1:13:14.515 --> 1:13:17.393
I was told
that you had moved away for good.

1:13:18.477 --> 1:13:21.688
Well, I, you know, couldn't resist
coming back for this exhibit.

1:13:21.772 --> 1:13:24.024
You might remember my passion
for Thomas Cole.

1:13:24.108 --> 1:13:28.320
Yes, I do. I just wish you had shown
the same passion for your dissertation.

1:13:30.155 --> 1:13:32.699
Excuse me. Professor Claire, um,

1:13:32.783 --> 1:13:36.412
in the third Voyage of Life painting,
why is the sailor so distraught?

1:13:37.162 --> 1:13:40.457
Oh, the third one is called, uh, Manhood.

1:13:40.541 --> 1:13:45.129
Uh, it's when Cole believes
we, uh, we lose the confidence of youth.

1:13:45.212 --> 1:13:49.091
Uh, go-- go check out the sailor's hands.
They're no longer on the tiller.

1:13:50.676 --> 1:13:51.844
[George chuckles]

1:13:51.927 --> 1:13:54.680
-[student] Thanks, Professor Claire.
-[Dr. Warren clears throat]

1:13:56.598 --> 1:13:58.725
Yeah… You know, I'm curious. Um…

1:13:59.726 --> 1:14:02.980
How did you get a teaching position
without a recommendation?

1:14:03.564 --> 1:14:06.275
Oh, I'm, um, I'm just a temp instructor.

1:14:06.358 --> 1:14:09.361
Um, one of the professors
took an emergency leave, and I, uh…

1:14:10.154 --> 1:14:11.864
I just stepped in to help.

1:14:11.947 --> 1:14:15.784
Interesting, then, how the students,
uh, they call you professor.

1:14:16.785 --> 1:14:18.579
[chuckling awkwardly] Yeah, yeah.

1:14:18.662 --> 1:14:21.206
Uh, yeah, right. I keep correcting them.

1:14:22.499 --> 1:14:24.877
Yeah. I get so tired of correcting them.

1:14:27.796 --> 1:14:29.006
Good day, Claire.

1:14:33.427 --> 1:14:34.386
What…

1:14:35.345 --> 1:14:36.722
What was all that about?

1:14:38.056 --> 1:14:40.267
Uh, yeah, I have no idea.

1:14:43.770 --> 1:14:45.189
I kind of think you do.

1:14:57.117 --> 1:14:59.495
I don't think
you should see Justine anymore.

1:15:01.455 --> 1:15:02.789
[George sighs]

1:15:04.374 --> 1:15:07.586
There's a lot of talk about her
at Saginaw.

1:15:10.047 --> 1:15:11.590
What kind of talk, George?

1:15:12.841 --> 1:15:15.302
Well, they say she's a closet lesbian.

1:15:16.428 --> 1:15:18.347
And she's clearly obsessed with you.

1:15:20.349 --> 1:15:23.352
[sighs] I think she is…

1:15:25.354 --> 1:15:28.065
instigating problems between us
intentionally.

1:15:34.780 --> 1:15:36.198
[indistinct chattering]

1:15:37.324 --> 1:15:39.535
[George]
Floyd, heading home for the holiday?

1:15:39.618 --> 1:15:40.953
[Floyd] What?

1:15:41.036 --> 1:15:44.498
Oh, no, no. Not for a while yet.
I-I still have, uh…

1:15:44.581 --> 1:15:46.833
-I have work to finish.
-Is something wrong?

1:15:49.586 --> 1:15:50.629
Actually,

1:15:52.005 --> 1:15:54.716
I got a call this morning
from Shelby Warren,

1:15:55.551 --> 1:15:57.010
your advisor from Columbia.

1:15:57.094 --> 1:15:57.928
Oh?

1:15:58.929 --> 1:16:03.100
His recommendation letter,
the one submitted with your application,

1:16:03.809 --> 1:16:05.686
he claims he never wrote it.

1:16:07.813 --> 1:16:10.649
Shelby's recollection is
that you asked him,

1:16:11.400 --> 1:16:12.985
but he told you he couldn't do it.

1:16:13.068 --> 1:16:15.821
In good conscience.
I remember the conversation well.

1:16:15.904 --> 1:16:19.157
-You forged it, didn't you?
-No. I… I…

1:16:19.241 --> 1:16:20.075
Oh…

1:16:20.158 --> 1:16:23.120
Floyd, I wrote the letter that I deserved.

1:16:23.870 --> 1:16:26.915
I-- I-- You need to understand why.

1:16:29.835 --> 1:16:31.962
As you know,
I'm quite fond of you, George,

1:16:32.045 --> 1:16:36.550
and you're popular with your students,
but this is a serious accusation.

1:16:36.633 --> 1:16:39.261
Can't we put a pin in this
until after the holiday?

1:16:39.344 --> 1:16:40.971
-Oh…
-Please, please, Floyd.

1:16:42.180 --> 1:16:44.766
I-- I understand your dilemma. I do.

1:16:46.393 --> 1:16:50.063
Floyd, I--
I have my entire family up here.

1:16:50.981 --> 1:16:52.899
I'm supposed to be home in an hour.

1:16:52.983 --> 1:16:57.154
I-- I really deserve the chance
to sit down and be heard.

1:16:57.738 --> 1:16:59.448
Man to man, huh?

1:17:00.616 --> 1:17:01.825
Friend to friend.

1:17:04.077 --> 1:17:05.662
I'll schedule an appointment.

1:17:07.956 --> 1:17:10.375
[banging knife]

1:17:13.837 --> 1:17:17.549
[man] I know you all think that Audrey
is a quite calm, conservative soul,

1:17:17.633 --> 1:17:20.594
but back in the day,
she was absolutely wild.

1:17:20.677 --> 1:17:23.513
-Don't believe a word!
-And then George came along.

1:17:23.597 --> 1:17:25.682
And he was always getting into trouble,

1:17:25.766 --> 1:17:27.934
which is why I went gray by 30.

1:17:28.018 --> 1:17:28.977
[Audrey] Oh, stop!

1:17:29.061 --> 1:17:33.231
But the real troublemaker
was this cousin that George idolized.

1:17:33.315 --> 1:17:35.192
Turned out to be a first-class homo.

1:17:36.109 --> 1:17:39.696
I don't know what was worse for
his parents: that he drowned or was gay.

1:17:42.491 --> 1:17:45.410
That is a truly repugnant thing to say.

1:17:48.121 --> 1:17:49.247
She's right, Tom.

1:17:50.791 --> 1:17:52.876
Henry's death was a family tragedy.

1:17:54.002 --> 1:17:55.796
He was such a talented young man.

1:17:55.879 --> 1:18:00.550
Henry used to do these exquisite
watercolors. Teeny-tiny paintings.

1:18:01.802 --> 1:18:03.595
What were the… the paintings of?

1:18:04.179 --> 1:18:07.391
Oh, the shoreline, ospreys, lighthouses.

1:18:07.474 --> 1:18:09.267
Just common seaside things.

1:18:09.351 --> 1:18:11.687
Turkey time, everybody.

1:18:11.770 --> 1:18:15.232
It's the way he presented them
that was unique.

1:18:15.899 --> 1:18:19.653
They even wanted to do a showing
of his work after he passed, but…

1:18:21.321 --> 1:18:23.865
they all just disappeared, apparently.

1:18:23.949 --> 1:18:26.326
-[Catherine's mom] What a shame.
-It really was.

1:18:26.410 --> 1:18:28.870
-[man] Nice job on the turkey, George.
-Thank you.

1:18:28.954 --> 1:18:30.622
Please, eat. It's gonna get cold.

1:18:30.706 --> 1:18:33.417
-[guests chatter indistinctly]
-[ominous music plays]

1:18:35.001 --> 1:18:36.169
[footsteps receding]

1:18:39.423 --> 1:18:40.340
Uh…

1:18:40.924 --> 1:18:42.551
Could you excuse me one minute?

1:18:48.515 --> 1:18:51.101
[retching, spitting]

1:18:56.314 --> 1:18:58.316
So you're starting with all this again?

1:18:59.234 --> 1:19:01.153
I happen to be sick, George.

1:19:02.154 --> 1:19:03.864
Throwing up my marriage.

1:19:05.073 --> 1:19:07.075
Now leave me the fuck alone!

1:19:09.369 --> 1:19:11.663
-Catherine…
-[door slams, lock clicks]

1:19:12.497 --> 1:19:13.749
[George] What the fuck?

1:19:15.125 --> 1:19:17.127
[turning door handle]

1:19:18.170 --> 1:19:20.589
Cath? Catherine?

1:19:25.385 --> 1:19:26.386
[Audrey] George?

1:19:26.887 --> 1:19:28.889
[ghostly echo]

1:19:36.229 --> 1:19:38.231
[creaking]

1:19:41.860 --> 1:19:42.944
[Ella] Please.

1:19:44.696 --> 1:19:46.573
[deep sighing]

1:19:48.325 --> 1:19:49.409
Please.

1:19:53.455 --> 1:19:55.582
[male ghostly voice]
No one understands us.

1:19:56.416 --> 1:19:58.126
[car engine idling]

1:19:58.210 --> 1:20:00.212
I am here for you.

1:20:03.465 --> 1:20:05.467
We are your friend.

1:20:06.802 --> 1:20:07.886
George.

1:20:09.596 --> 1:20:11.306
Free yourself.

1:20:17.938 --> 1:20:20.273
[breathing deeply]

1:20:23.151 --> 1:20:24.945
[sighing]

1:20:36.373 --> 1:20:38.458
[Floyd, in distance]
How was your holiday?

1:20:44.840 --> 1:20:47.425
[uneasy music playing]

1:21:10.699 --> 1:21:11.908
Hello, Floyd.

1:21:12.868 --> 1:21:13.910
George.

1:21:14.661 --> 1:21:16.872
I didn't expect to see you till tomorrow.

1:21:16.955 --> 1:21:20.208
Taking advantage
of the warm spell we're having, huh?

1:21:20.292 --> 1:21:24.462
Yeah, I thought I'd go out one last time
before storing her for winter.

1:21:25.255 --> 1:21:27.048
You're so lucky to have her.

1:21:28.550 --> 1:21:30.719
That last spin you took me on,
it… [grunts]

1:21:30.802 --> 1:21:33.889
…it really reminded me
how much I-- I miss sailing.

1:21:35.015 --> 1:21:35.891
Especially when…

1:21:36.474 --> 1:21:38.977
when I'm feeling a little… a little low.

1:21:40.854 --> 1:21:41.980
You want to join me?

1:21:42.063 --> 1:21:43.857
Oh, no. I-- I…

1:21:43.940 --> 1:21:46.735
-I don't want to in-- intrude.
-It's fine.

1:21:48.612 --> 1:21:51.239
The river's as good a place as any
to have our talk.

1:22:04.127 --> 1:22:04.961
Hey.

1:22:09.841 --> 1:22:11.468
What's the matter? Are you okay?

1:22:19.351 --> 1:22:20.185
[groans]

1:22:20.727 --> 1:22:21.561
Things…

1:22:23.563 --> 1:22:26.274
just aren't great.

1:22:32.155 --> 1:22:33.156
It's him,

1:22:33.740 --> 1:22:34.616
isn't it?

1:22:36.201 --> 1:22:38.119
[inhales deeply]

1:22:38.203 --> 1:22:39.746
I know his kind all too well.

1:22:42.499 --> 1:22:43.625
I grew up with it.

1:22:46.044 --> 1:22:49.464
If I had someone as good as you,
I'd kiss the fucking ground she walked on.

1:22:49.965 --> 1:22:50.924
I swear to God.

1:23:01.726 --> 1:23:05.105
[haunting music playing]

1:23:19.911 --> 1:23:21.162
[exhaling]

1:23:23.707 --> 1:23:24.958
[Catherine grunts softly]

1:23:27.669 --> 1:23:30.797
[George] I'm eager to tell you the truth

1:23:31.965 --> 1:23:33.258
about the…

1:23:34.050 --> 1:23:37.178
problems I had at Columbia with…
with Shelby.

1:23:38.304 --> 1:23:40.849
Look, it's a complicated story, but, um…

1:23:41.808 --> 1:23:42.851
essentially,

1:23:44.019 --> 1:23:45.687
I got ostracized…

1:23:47.313 --> 1:23:48.815
for reporting misconduct.

1:23:49.691 --> 1:23:52.318
It was… it was sexual misconduct.

1:23:53.778 --> 1:23:57.741
Look, I'm willing to listen,
because I-- I care about your well-being,

1:23:57.824 --> 1:23:58.700
but forgery,

1:23:58.783 --> 1:24:00.452
regardless of the reason,

1:24:01.077 --> 1:24:02.370
is a crime.

1:24:02.954 --> 1:24:06.041
I don't want us meeting
on false pretenses here.

1:24:07.876 --> 1:24:10.045
I can't keep this to myself forever.

1:24:10.128 --> 1:24:13.965
Yeah, I-I understand that,
and-and, look, I appreciate your dilemma--

1:24:14.049 --> 1:24:14.966
So…

1:24:15.759 --> 1:24:19.596
So tomorrow, I plan
to bring the situation to HR.

1:24:21.848 --> 1:24:23.433
And we both know the outcome.

1:24:25.727 --> 1:24:27.896
They won't permit you to remain on staff.

1:24:29.105 --> 1:24:31.107
[melancholy music playing]

1:24:34.486 --> 1:24:35.612
You okay, George?

1:24:40.533 --> 1:24:41.576
There, there.

1:24:42.660 --> 1:24:44.537
All things must pass.

1:24:46.372 --> 1:24:47.373
Yeah.

1:24:48.333 --> 1:24:50.543
I promise you'll get through this.

1:24:54.297 --> 1:24:55.256
[bell jingles]

1:24:55.757 --> 1:24:57.425
-Hey, Cal.
-Hey.

1:24:58.093 --> 1:24:59.886
I called in a take-out order.

1:24:59.969 --> 1:25:01.054
Be right back.

1:25:01.137 --> 1:25:03.139
[music playing softly over speakers]

1:25:13.525 --> 1:25:16.903
[chuckles] Excuse me.
Sorry, I just wonder…

1:25:16.986 --> 1:25:18.738
Where did you buy that scarf?

1:25:20.281 --> 1:25:21.241
Oh, um…

1:25:23.660 --> 1:25:24.911
It was a gift.

1:25:25.787 --> 1:25:26.704
Oh.

1:25:27.539 --> 1:25:29.207
[Cal] There you go, $6.57.

1:25:29.290 --> 1:25:31.084
Thanks. Just two back, please.

1:25:34.420 --> 1:25:35.338
[bell jingles]

1:25:43.263 --> 1:25:45.765
[breathing heavily]

1:25:53.606 --> 1:25:56.401
You're putting in late nights too,
huh, George?

1:26:02.782 --> 1:26:03.908
Jesus.

1:26:04.659 --> 1:26:05.660
Look--

1:26:06.244 --> 1:26:07.412
You're soaking wet.

1:26:07.495 --> 1:26:09.789
[laughs] What-- what the fuck, Justine?

1:26:10.707 --> 1:26:12.834
Are you officially stalking me now?

1:26:12.917 --> 1:26:14.460
Officially? No.

1:26:14.544 --> 1:26:17.547
Then why are you suddenly
everywhere I turn?

1:26:18.298 --> 1:26:20.717
Because I really care about Catherine.

1:26:21.384 --> 1:26:23.720
Yeah, you've made that perfectly clear.

1:26:25.430 --> 1:26:27.932
Uh, I'm not sure how to take that.

1:26:28.016 --> 1:26:30.143
I-- I kind of think that you do.

1:26:30.810 --> 1:26:35.190
Tell me, George,
how'd your mom like that scarf I made her?

1:26:37.567 --> 1:26:38.943
Uh, yeah, she…

1:26:39.444 --> 1:26:41.446
She didn't really care for it, actually.

1:26:41.529 --> 1:26:44.324
She… she said that it felt cheap.

1:26:44.949 --> 1:26:47.952
Well, that explains
the neck it ended up on, then, huh?

1:26:48.786 --> 1:26:49.871
[scoffs]

1:26:49.954 --> 1:26:51.122
Go fuck yourself.

1:26:51.206 --> 1:26:54.000
Do you want to explain
what happened at the Met?

1:26:58.213 --> 1:27:02.300
If you got something to say to me,
Justine, you should just spit it out.

1:27:04.093 --> 1:27:05.094
[engine turns over]

1:27:06.638 --> 1:27:07.722
[Justine] I will.

1:27:13.978 --> 1:27:16.189
[reporter on radio]
Government said there was no way

1:27:16.272 --> 1:27:19.150
they would meet the new demands
for the hostages' release.

1:27:19.234 --> 1:27:22.862
Then it accused the Iranians
of not taking good care of the hostages.

1:27:23.988 --> 1:27:26.699
[reporter 2] The Carter Administration
stepped up its pressure

1:27:26.783 --> 1:27:29.953
on the Iranian government
by charging the hostages…

1:27:45.176 --> 1:27:46.344
Oh my God.

1:27:47.220 --> 1:27:48.429
What are you doing?

1:27:50.890 --> 1:27:52.016
[screams]

1:27:55.270 --> 1:27:56.938
Fucking psycho!

1:28:06.990 --> 1:28:08.825
[horn honking]

1:28:21.838 --> 1:28:23.339
What happened to your clothes?

1:28:25.466 --> 1:28:26.843
I got sick on them.

1:28:31.681 --> 1:28:33.182
You and I need to talk.

1:28:33.933 --> 1:28:35.476
Not tonight, we don't.

1:28:36.019 --> 1:28:37.270
And why is that?

1:28:37.353 --> 1:28:39.689
Did you not hear me? I said I got sick.

1:28:42.150 --> 1:28:45.194
Sleep down here, then.
I don't wanna catch anything you have.

1:28:51.492 --> 1:28:52.618
[slams shut]

1:28:56.664 --> 1:28:58.374
[George] If you're really here,

1:28:59.959 --> 1:29:01.544
show me a sign.

[groans]

1:29:18.269 --> 1:29:19.729
What the fuck is going…

1:29:34.786 --> 1:29:37.330
Have your boyfriend
fix the window in the morning.

1:29:38.748 --> 1:29:42.460
[eerie music playing]

1:29:49.926 --> 1:29:51.928

1:30:25.837 --> 1:30:26.671
[George] Cole.

1:30:26.754 --> 1:30:28.214
Hey, it's George Claire.

1:30:29.424 --> 1:30:31.509
Uh, I have an emergency this morning.

1:30:31.592 --> 1:30:34.679
I was wondering if we could get you here
a little bit early.

1:30:35.221 --> 1:30:36.264
Can I help you?

1:30:37.348 --> 1:30:39.183
Oh, uh, I need this filled quickly.

1:30:40.893 --> 1:30:42.854
It's for my daughter's night terrors.

1:30:42.937 --> 1:30:45.106
[machine beeping rhythmically]

1:30:54.824 --> 1:30:57.118
They say she might never come out of this.

1:30:57.827 --> 1:30:59.954
The doctor never met Justine.

1:31:00.037 --> 1:31:02.623
He doesn't know
the force of her personality, Bram.

1:31:07.044 --> 1:31:11.299
[reporter] …Department of Agriculture.
The announcement comes tomorrow.

1:31:11.382 --> 1:31:15.344
In other news, police have identified
the body pulled from the Hudson last night

1:31:15.428 --> 1:31:19.056
as 68-year-old Saginaw professor
Floyd DeBeers,

1:31:19.140 --> 1:31:21.642
a frequent fixture
of the Hudson sailing community.

1:31:22.977 --> 1:31:23.895
What?

1:31:25.104 --> 1:31:28.483
Yeah, I guess he went out
for a sail yesterday and…

1:31:29.650 --> 1:31:32.820
They assumed he had a heart attack
and fell overboard.

1:31:34.197 --> 1:31:35.573
Oh… oh my God.

1:31:38.576 --> 1:31:39.785
[exhales sharply] Jesus.

1:31:39.869 --> 1:31:40.703
Yeah.

1:31:42.371 --> 1:31:44.999
I know you two became very close
very quickly,

1:31:46.125 --> 1:31:48.961
so I-I'll keep you posted
on the memorial service.

1:31:49.045 --> 1:31:50.087
Yeah.

1:31:56.135 --> 1:31:57.345
And…

1:31:57.428 --> 1:32:00.431
we're going to be needing
an interim chair.

1:32:00.515 --> 1:32:01.849
Your name came up,

1:32:01.933 --> 1:32:03.309
if you'd be willing.

1:32:04.310 --> 1:32:05.436
Um…

1:32:06.812 --> 1:32:08.105
Oh God, um…

1:32:11.067 --> 1:32:12.193
Yeah, yeah.

1:32:13.861 --> 1:32:15.655
Whatever the department needs.

1:32:22.745 --> 1:32:23.621
[clears throat]

1:32:24.288 --> 1:32:27.250
I have some very sad news to report.

1:32:29.252 --> 1:32:31.128
Some of you may have already heard.

1:32:32.880 --> 1:32:35.675
[ominous music playing]

1:32:40.429 --> 1:32:42.348
Wait. Why-- why is this up?

1:32:43.599 --> 1:32:45.226
I-I didn't choose this slide.

1:33:07.748 --> 1:33:09.250
[projector continues clicking]

1:33:11.877 --> 1:33:13.004
What is this?

1:33:15.923 --> 1:33:17.258
Huh? Who did this?

1:33:20.678 --> 1:33:22.013
Is this some kind of joke?

1:33:22.555 --> 1:33:25.474
[clicking]

1:33:26.267 --> 1:33:28.019
Who did this? Huh?

1:33:30.855 --> 1:33:32.189
Who did this?

1:33:33.858 --> 1:33:36.193
[yelling]
Who the fuck is responsible for this?

1:33:39.989 --> 1:33:42.783
Well, fuck it. [breathing shakily]

1:33:44.535 --> 1:33:48.205

1:34:39.674 --> 1:34:40.841
You're home early.

1:34:41.342 --> 1:34:43.052
Did you cancel your class?

1:34:43.678 --> 1:34:45.262
Is something wrong, Cath?

1:34:48.432 --> 1:34:49.684
Why?

1:34:49.767 --> 1:34:50.851
Well, you… [scoffs]

1:34:51.644 --> 1:34:53.938
You skipped your protein shake again.

1:34:55.606 --> 1:34:56.524
Thanks.

1:34:58.359 --> 1:34:59.610
Where's Cole?

1:35:01.862 --> 1:35:03.531
He had to leave

1:35:03.614 --> 1:35:06.826
because you had him
come in so early today.

1:35:06.909 --> 1:35:08.202
Right.

1:35:08.285 --> 1:35:09.787
Well, that's good. We can…

1:35:10.663 --> 1:35:12.957
We can sit down,
have that chat you've been pushing for.

1:35:13.666 --> 1:35:15.167
I don't think so. Not tonight.

1:35:15.251 --> 1:35:17.837
Why not tonight?
You said it was extremely important.

1:35:17.920 --> 1:35:19.588
I don't think that it is anymore.

1:35:27.012 --> 1:35:30.349
-What were you doing upstairs?
-I was putting Franny to bed.

1:35:30.975 --> 1:35:33.686
Oh, what?
I… I can't give her a goodnight kiss?

1:35:33.769 --> 1:35:35.771
Yeah, she was very tired, George.

1:35:45.197 --> 1:35:47.700
You know? I think I'm gonna
give her a kiss anyway.

1:35:47.783 --> 1:35:50.327
No, she's out cold, George. No, she's…

1:35:53.914 --> 1:35:55.332
-George.
-[Franny moans]

1:35:57.835 --> 1:35:58.794
Why is she dressed?

1:35:59.754 --> 1:36:01.130
I told you. She was tired.

1:36:03.591 --> 1:36:06.260
You know that they're expecting
a deep freeze tonight?

1:36:07.553 --> 1:36:09.305
It's a terrible time to travel.

1:36:12.266 --> 1:36:13.517
Hey, where are you going?

Get off!

With my goddamn daughter!

1:36:52.556 --> 1:36:54.391
-Home!
-This is your fucking home!

1:36:54.475 --> 1:36:56.727
Nowhere's home with you, George!

1:36:56.811 --> 1:36:57.895
Fuck!

1:36:59.063 --> 1:37:00.189
I know about Floyd!

1:37:01.232 --> 1:37:04.610
Your clothes were soaked that night!
And Justine? You hated her.

1:37:04.693 --> 1:37:06.946
I know you were involved.
I know it in my bones.

1:37:07.029 --> 1:37:10.241
And what about that cousin?
That cousin whose identity you stole?

1:37:10.324 --> 1:37:13.869
Oh, you've… you've really
lost your mind, you know that?

1:37:13.953 --> 1:37:17.414
You've-- you've gone way,
way over the edge!

1:37:17.498 --> 1:37:18.791
No, I've woken up.

1:37:18.874 --> 1:37:22.378
And so will Franny
when she learns exactly who her father is.

1:37:23.045 --> 1:37:25.631
You want to leave? Go! Go, if you want to.

1:37:26.465 --> 1:37:30.594
Go. Get up. Leave your daughter
with this, this monster you've conjured up

1:37:30.678 --> 1:37:34.014
in your paranoid, food-deprived brain!

Oh my God. Franny!
