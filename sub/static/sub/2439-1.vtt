00:05.672 --> 00:08.584
Finding the tone and energy of a movie
in the first scene

00:08.675 --> 00:11.508
is very important.

00:11.595 --> 00:15.258
There are two storylines
in the secret in their eyes,

00:15.349 --> 00:19.308
a love story and a detective story.

00:20.687 --> 00:24.350
They don't function on the same level.

00:24.441 --> 00:29.151
You could say the love story
is the main storyline,

00:29.238 --> 00:33.607
the one that drives the entire movie.

00:33.700 --> 00:39.115
And in musical terms, it's the tone,
the main theme.

00:39.206 --> 00:42.073
The detective story is the trigger.

00:42.167 --> 00:46.911
It doesn't drive the plot,
but rather triggers what happens.

00:47.005 --> 00:51.795
It's the secondary theme in terms
of importance, but the dominant one.

00:51.885 --> 00:55.127
It's the macguffin, as Hitchcock would say.

00:55.222 --> 00:57.463
Here we are in the first scene.

00:57.558 --> 01:02.678
We decided that this scene
had to be about the love story.

01:02.771 --> 01:05.979
It may be the most important moment,
the one he remembers best,

01:06.066 --> 01:09.650
the one that broke him.

01:09.736 --> 01:13.024
It's repeated at the end of the second act,

01:13.115 --> 01:16.949
bringing us into the present.

01:18.287 --> 01:20.869
This scene also had to have characteristics

01:20.956 --> 01:25.165
related to memory,
as both storyline and theme.

01:25.252 --> 01:28.039
Memories start to take shape here.

01:32.551 --> 01:35.167
We can remember a person's eyes,

01:35.262 --> 01:38.220
a person's tone
when they told us something important.

01:38.307 --> 01:42.892
Everything else around us
was like a brush stroke of color

01:42.978 --> 01:44.843
or a blurred movement.

01:44.938 --> 01:48.897
That's kind of the esthetic of this scene.

01:48.984 --> 01:54.195
It's an important scene
because memories start to take shape in it.

01:59.453 --> 02:04.493
We didn't want it to end
at a natural ending point,

02:04.583 --> 02:08.121
but rather to be suddenly interrupted
so we could move on to the story.

02:08.211 --> 02:12.295
This tells us that the author was imagining
or remembering what we just saw.

02:13.675 --> 02:17.133
This sequence of esposito writing

02:17.220 --> 02:19.927
and starting the novel in various ways

02:20.015 --> 02:23.803
is a sort of overture of the movie.

02:23.894 --> 02:29.184
In it, we can touch on all the themes,
storylines, and especially the tones

02:29.274 --> 02:31.390
found within the movie.

02:31.485 --> 02:34.477
The main tone

02:36.198 --> 02:39.281
isn't nostalgic, but rather melancholy.

02:39.368 --> 02:43.361
A romantic tone hovers
over the entire movie.

02:43.455 --> 02:47.994
But there's also... coming in right here

02:48.669 --> 02:53.538
is a tone and storyline
from a memory that is exceedingly

02:56.968 --> 02:59.550
generous in its recollection.

03:00.347 --> 03:04.090
His memories almost seem like commercials.

03:04.184 --> 03:07.347
The highlights, everything is very soft,

03:07.437 --> 03:09.928
lyrical, smiling.

03:10.023 --> 03:15.609
But the character chokes on this memory
and finds it completely ridiculous.

03:15.696 --> 03:20.781
However, the image of this girl,
Liliana coloto, alive,

03:20.867 --> 03:24.610
which is something he can only imagine,
is very present in it.

03:27.666 --> 03:32.786
The other storyline and tone of the movie
come in here.

03:40.303 --> 03:42.715
Please, don't...

03:43.056 --> 03:46.264
Please, please...

03:48.395 --> 03:51.808
We know that this is
a painful memory for him,

03:51.898 --> 03:55.937
that plea he was unable to answer.

03:56.820 --> 04:01.484
In those four minutes,
we introduced all the storylines.

04:01.575 --> 04:04.658
I'm going to talk a lot about
the energy in a film,

04:04.745 --> 04:07.532
the energy curve of the tones.

04:07.622 --> 04:10.159
It's more important to talk about
than the plot,

04:10.250 --> 04:13.583
which you either get or you don't
when you see the movie.

04:13.670 --> 04:16.036
There's no need for us to talk about that.

04:29.060 --> 04:32.268
This is the end of that introduction.

04:35.609 --> 04:37.270
A man and his memory.

04:44.075 --> 04:45.736
A sort of prologue.

04:45.827 --> 04:46.827
I fear

04:46.953 --> 04:49.285
the first act starts here.

04:54.711 --> 04:57.168
The movie could have easily started here.

04:57.255 --> 04:59.792
In terms of the plot,

04:59.883 --> 05:03.751
nothing we saw before this matters

05:03.845 --> 05:08.464
because it will all be explained
and narrated in a linear fashion.

05:08.558 --> 05:11.891
But as viewers,
we are already somewhere else,

05:11.978 --> 05:16.062
especially in terms of tone and energy.

05:16.149 --> 05:22.736
If the movie had started here,
it would've been a more conventional story,

05:22.823 --> 05:27.487
and we would've been required
to participate in the movie

05:27.577 --> 05:30.068
in a much more conventional manner,

05:30.163 --> 05:34.497
without emotional or energetic involvement.

05:34.626 --> 05:36.833
The gates have opened.

05:38.046 --> 05:42.790
One of the major decisions in the movie
was how to treat the past and the present

05:42.884 --> 05:45.045
in terms of color.

05:46.346 --> 05:51.340
Every scene contains a hidden
or possible cliché,

05:51.434 --> 05:53.846
and we have to determine
what that cliché is

05:53.937 --> 05:57.771
so we can avoid it as much as possible.

05:57.858 --> 06:00.645
The cliché in a movie
set in both the present and the past

06:00.735 --> 06:03.977
is that everything in the present
is colorful and alive,

06:04.072 --> 06:06.279
while the past is black and white or sepia.

06:06.366 --> 06:08.982
We wanted to do exactly the opposite,

06:09.786 --> 06:13.904
not only to avoid doing what everyone does,

06:13.999 --> 06:16.240
what we've seen so many times,

06:16.334 --> 06:19.167
but also because,
since this is a movie about memory,

06:20.380 --> 06:22.917
the past has color, too.

06:23.008 --> 06:26.876
We don't remember the past
in black and white, but rather in color.

06:26.970 --> 06:32.090
But the dominant colors
in the scenes we remember are simpler.

06:32.183 --> 06:35.175
In the present everything is similar,

06:35.270 --> 06:39.764
everything is somewhat faded, even.

06:39.858 --> 06:44.022
We're all watching the same scene,
yet if we had to close our eyes

06:44.112 --> 06:49.232
and describe the colors we see,
we wouldn't remember it.

06:49.326 --> 06:54.821
In memories, though,
we always assign a color to every object.

06:54.915 --> 06:59.500
Here in the present, we work with colors

06:59.586 --> 07:03.625
that are quite muted and diluted,

07:03.715 --> 07:06.377
with a softer palette.

07:06.468 --> 07:09.301
The only exception is the reds

07:09.387 --> 07:13.130
that abound in Irene's world.

07:13.224 --> 07:18.469
It's in her clothing,
in the flower and in the curtains.

07:18.563 --> 07:19.928
The color red is a link,

07:20.023 --> 07:25.438
the only link between the Irene
of the present and the Irene of the past.

07:25.528 --> 07:30.568
This is true from both a thematic
perspective and a color perspective.

07:30.659 --> 07:36.746
We'll see Irene's penchant for reds
in the past as well.

07:39.793 --> 07:41.124
I don't know why.

07:41.878 --> 07:43.163
It's been on my mind.

07:43.463 --> 07:47.706
Our first little visual effect
of the movie is here.

07:47.801 --> 07:54.013
The logo of the café
that brought us coffee that day

07:54.099 --> 07:56.886
was on those cups.

07:56.977 --> 07:58.968
We had to erase them on the computer.

08:01.398 --> 08:05.391
That's just a taste of
all the visual effects

08:05.485 --> 08:08.397
in the movie that are coming up soon.

08:08.488 --> 08:12.982
There are 109 takes with effects in the
movie, not including the stadium scene.

08:13.827 --> 08:14.987
Here, let me.

08:15.453 --> 08:17.660
I can't...

08:20.250 --> 08:21.535
It weighs a ton.

08:22.085 --> 08:26.795
There is a strong chemistry
between soledad villamil and Ricardo Darin.

08:26.881 --> 08:29.418
We discovered this
in same love, same rain,

08:29.509 --> 08:32.626
and it's apparent to anyone
who has seen that movie.

08:33.429 --> 08:37.298
Though these actors get along
just fine professionally,

08:37.392 --> 08:40.304
we've all worked together for many years,

08:40.395 --> 08:46.140
they're not lifelong friends
who hang out all the time or anything.

08:46.234 --> 08:50.898
As soon as we started working,
the friendship, the chemistry between them

08:50.989 --> 08:54.732
was obvious, like in this scene.

08:54.826 --> 08:58.114
It makes any dialogue
you could possibly write

08:58.204 --> 09:02.948
to demonstrate the love between them
banal and superfluous.

09:03.043 --> 09:07.878
It's glaringly obvious
in the way they look at each other.

09:07.964 --> 09:10.171
Miss Irene menendez Hastings.

09:10.425 --> 09:11.540
"Hastings."

09:11.634 --> 09:14.216
We can see here
that the skin tones are more prominent.

09:14.304 --> 09:18.217
The red she's wearing
is a link to the past.

09:18.308 --> 09:22.768
But we can also see
that the green tones are intensified,

09:22.854 --> 09:24.594
the red tones are intensified.

09:24.689 --> 09:29.979
The color of the wood in the courts
is almost fiery.

09:30.070 --> 09:32.402
This is where Guillermo francella comes in.

09:32.489 --> 09:37.358
For those of you watching
who aren't from Argentina,

09:37.452 --> 09:42.116
he's a huge star in our country.

09:42.207 --> 09:45.199
He's a very popular person
and a very famous actor

09:45.293 --> 09:49.707
best known for his comedic work.

09:49.798 --> 09:54.508
We decided to introduce him
to the audience gradually,

09:54.594 --> 09:59.588
so that his mere appearance
wouldn't provoke laughter or exclamations

09:59.682 --> 10:02.594
or shift the weight of the plot.

10:02.685 --> 10:06.098
We saw him out of focus in the last scene.

10:06.189 --> 10:11.354
Here, we see his hands, his profile,
his back, slightly out of focus.

10:11.444 --> 10:14.982
And soon we'll see him in his entirety.

10:15.073 --> 10:19.066
This allowed us to moderate all the,
"look, it's francella!"

10:19.160 --> 10:21.822
That might've been heard in the theater.

10:22.080 --> 10:23.365
Hi, fellas.

10:23.456 --> 10:24.456
Good morning.

10:24.582 --> 10:26.914
Ma'am, did a Saint die this morning?

10:27.001 --> 10:32.541
Shooting in 235:1, or wide-screen format,

10:33.216 --> 10:36.708
eliminates the need for establishing shots.

10:36.803 --> 10:41.547
In each shot,
the characters, the architecture,

10:41.641 --> 10:44.223
everything around us is important.

10:44.310 --> 10:48.053
That's a huge advantage of this format

10:48.148 --> 10:53.563
over a square television format

10:53.653 --> 10:55.985
or even the wide-screen format of hdtv,

10:56.072 --> 10:59.155
which, with an aspect ratio of 16:9,
is much wider than this one.

10:59.325 --> 11:02.362
Well, I may dress like a toad...

11:02.453 --> 11:07.664
It was easy to work with
Guillermo francella

11:07.750 --> 11:12.164
in the sense that he's a great actor
and things come easily to him.

11:12.255 --> 11:16.624
But the approach we took with him...
The word "energy" comes up again.

11:16.718 --> 11:21.929
This character's energy
tends to take him to his desk

11:22.015 --> 11:25.178
to hide behind all those stacks of files,

11:26.311 --> 11:31.851
to use the act of binding case records

11:32.192 --> 11:37.903
or going downstairs as a crutch,
and to use subtle, low-key irony,

11:37.989 --> 11:43.325
energetically low-key, that is,
instead of open farce.

11:43.995 --> 11:46.327
Ask judge fortuna.

11:47.540 --> 11:49.531
I want a solution,
not two problems.

11:49.626 --> 11:52.163
Why is asking me a problem?

11:53.504 --> 11:56.541
It's not that.
It just seemed silly...

11:56.633 --> 11:58.498
To bother you with...

11:58.593 --> 12:02.131
A small detail, the person typing
in the back was a mistake.

12:02.222 --> 12:06.465
The typewriter in front of him
that's blocking his hands

12:06.559 --> 12:08.675
was actually another computer effect.

12:08.770 --> 12:12.638
The man was typing at the desk,
but he didn't have a typewriter.

12:12.732 --> 12:14.222
No one noticed during filming.

12:16.402 --> 12:21.317
Here, the tone between these two characters
is deliberately humorous.

12:21.407 --> 12:22.988
The humor is very dry.

12:23.076 --> 12:27.160
They even tell jokes
as we go down the corridor.

12:27.247 --> 12:33.243
There's a point where inspector baez
makes a witty remark.

12:34.921 --> 12:37.879
Here. That made people
laugh in the theater.

12:37.966 --> 12:41.333
We're entering a world
you could almost call comedic.

12:41.427 --> 12:42.963
It's the comedy of work.

12:43.054 --> 12:47.172
Everything is emphasized
so that what comes next,

12:47.267 --> 12:51.476
the character's shock,
is experienced by the audience as well.

12:51.562 --> 12:54.645
We're not just showing it to them,
they feel it, too.

12:54.732 --> 12:56.643
So we arrive laughing...

13:08.454 --> 13:13.244
The tone changes radically,
not only for him, but also for us.

13:15.712 --> 13:19.830
Because we're experiencing it firsthand,
we can understand

13:21.467 --> 13:25.756
the shock the character experiences
when he sees

13:25.847 --> 13:29.806
that exposed, fragile, mutilated body.

13:33.855 --> 13:38.645
This moment triggers everything
that happens next and changes his life.

13:41.988 --> 13:43.728
This part was filmed with dialogue.

13:43.823 --> 13:48.613
You could hear the inspector's voice
and that of the coroner,

13:48.703 --> 13:52.116
brilliantly played by Ricardo cerone.

13:53.166 --> 13:55.248
There was almost black-humor dialogue here

14:00.840 --> 14:06.210
I decided to cut this dialogue in editing.

14:06.304 --> 14:10.764
I wanted everything to be out of focus

14:10.850 --> 14:16.686
and to concentrate solely on esposito
and the dead woman,

14:16.773 --> 14:19.389
on the connection between them.

14:25.531 --> 14:27.146
The old lady mentioned...

14:27.241 --> 14:29.778
Two builders working
on the terrace in number 3...

14:29.869 --> 14:34.784
We also had takes where you could see
gioia, baez, speaking in focus,

14:35.208 --> 14:37.790
but I decided to go this route.

14:39.087 --> 14:41.874
- See you later, esposito.
- I'll go with you.

14:55.728 --> 14:59.346
Morales' character, the widower,
comes in here.

14:59.440 --> 15:01.601
Of all the characters,

15:01.692 --> 15:07.107
we had the hardest time deciding
how his reactions should be.

15:07.198 --> 15:11.282
There are obviously two sides
to his personality,

15:11.369 --> 15:15.738
two conflicting
and apparently very antagonistic sides.

15:15.832 --> 15:19.745
On the one hand, there's
the passionate love

15:21.754 --> 15:24.336
that will make him imprison himself
his whole life.

15:24.424 --> 15:28.337
His life ends right here
because of that passionate love.

15:28.428 --> 15:31.511
On the other hand,
there's the cold, methodical personality

15:31.597 --> 15:36.387
that leads him to formulate
a very difficult plan

15:36.477 --> 15:41.767
and maintain a silence and lifestyle
for 25 years without giving himself away.

15:42.859 --> 15:47.398
We opted for this approach,
which Pablo rago is doing here,

15:47.488 --> 15:49.194
and which he does extremely well.

15:49.282 --> 15:53.776
Instead of a person
who breaks down crying and screaming,

15:53.870 --> 15:57.658
which might be more normal, more real,

15:57.748 --> 16:00.785
we see a person
who is breaking apart inside,

16:00.877 --> 16:05.371
a person whose pain
is accompanied by a sort of coldness,

16:05.465 --> 16:07.797
a person whose eyes are making a decision.

16:11.053 --> 16:16.844
Right now, his eyes are saying,
"I'm going to catch that man."

16:23.941 --> 16:25.556
We transition with memories here.

16:25.651 --> 16:29.735
We thought that it was
the details people remember,

16:29.822 --> 16:32.734
like a kettle whistling.

16:32.825 --> 16:35.111
And from esposito's perspective, perhaps,

16:35.203 --> 16:39.446
all he saw in that scene was morales' back
and the steam from the kettle.

16:40.291 --> 16:43.328
- Who will want it?
- Just get it out of my sight.

16:44.337 --> 16:51.175
Here we start setting up the running gag,
the typewriter.

16:51.260 --> 16:53.501
I, criminal judge
raimundo fortuna lacalle...

16:53.596 --> 16:54.927
Hereby declare myself...

16:55.014 --> 16:59.428
This composition, which 235:1 allows,
is wonderful.

16:59.519 --> 17:01.475
Playing with different shots.

17:03.689 --> 17:08.979
The connection between them starts here.

17:10.029 --> 17:15.615
We start to see other facets
of Irene's highly efficient character.

17:15.701 --> 17:18.943
She can pick up on an office joke.

17:19.038 --> 17:21.119
Legally-speaking, insane...

17:21.207 --> 17:25.290
You'll see this type of framing
from below a lot in the movie,

17:25.377 --> 17:29.371
with many elements in the foreground
blocking our view.

17:33.844 --> 17:39.555
The purpose of all this was to make us,
as viewers, feel like we were hiding

17:39.642 --> 17:44.477
in a corner of this office,
trying to see what was going on.

17:44.564 --> 17:49.058
This adds the element
of spying on the story,

17:49.151 --> 17:52.314
of looking over the characters' shoulders.

17:52.405 --> 17:56.990
As a result, we get even more involved

17:57.076 --> 17:59.658
because we're trying to find out
what's going on.

17:59.745 --> 18:03.784
Benjamin, just to show you court 18
is acting in good faith...

18:03.958 --> 18:07.200
Remember you were upset the other day
over getting a case?

18:08.546 --> 18:10.377
Well, the case has been solved.

18:11.507 --> 18:14.249
Two builders working in number 3.

18:14.594 --> 18:16.334
They're under arrest in the 25th.

18:16.804 --> 18:18.590
Whenever you have a chance...

18:18.681 --> 18:22.674
In this scene, we start to see
two of the great discoveries in the movie.

18:22.768 --> 18:26.852
Mariano argento, playing Romano,

18:26.939 --> 18:32.775
and Mario alarcon,
playing judge fortuna lacalle.

18:33.779 --> 18:37.522
He won all the courts' unofficial awards

18:37.617 --> 18:41.656
as the most real and believable character
in the movie

18:41.746 --> 18:44.078
according to people who work in the courts.

18:46.000 --> 18:47.490
Esposito, how are you?

18:48.002 --> 18:51.119
Here we have a different color palette,
the color of memory.

18:51.213 --> 18:54.626
Everything is forced,
everything takes on a greenish hue

18:54.717 --> 18:57.800
when we look outside,
that fluorescent light.

18:57.887 --> 19:02.927
And here, as we walk in,
everything takes on a reddish hue.

19:04.143 --> 19:06.680
A strong red. We transition from daylight,

19:06.771 --> 19:10.764
which is colder and clearer,
to the light of a catacomb.

19:10.858 --> 19:12.519
A dangling light bulb.

19:12.610 --> 19:15.522
Here we see that transition occur faster.

19:15.613 --> 19:20.073
Outside the cell,
the cold fluorescent light we see there,

19:20.159 --> 19:23.572
and inside, a deep red

19:23.663 --> 19:27.155
illuminated by an incandescent bulb.

19:28.042 --> 19:29.452
He's caceres.

19:38.302 --> 19:39.462
Caceres.

19:43.182 --> 19:44.388
It's okay.

19:54.151 --> 19:57.439
You see that mixture
of cold light and warm light a lot

19:57.530 --> 20:00.943
in the corridors of the courts,
like in this scene.

20:01.033 --> 20:05.276
The courts are designed
with this huge skylight in the middle,

20:05.371 --> 20:09.535
in the hollow you see outside the
corridors, which we'll see now.

20:09.625 --> 20:12.458
It provides a lot of white daylight,

20:12.545 --> 20:15.457
but that light falls
right in the middle of the corridor,

20:15.548 --> 20:22.044
to such an extent that the offices require
artificial lighting.

20:22.138 --> 20:26.472
As a result, there's that constant mixture
of hot and cold in the courts,

20:26.559 --> 20:30.973
of cold light in the middle of the
corridor, which we enhance and make green,

20:31.063 --> 20:35.557
and the artificial light in the offices,
which we make red.

20:35.651 --> 20:37.437
There's a constant mix.

20:37.528 --> 20:39.860
We can even see it in
the characters' faces,

20:39.947 --> 20:43.986
almost green here and almost red there.

20:44.076 --> 20:47.068
It's a very distinct mix
that's quite noticeable in the courts

20:47.163 --> 20:51.122
and it gives us this atmosphere
of simultaneous interiors and exteriors.

20:51.208 --> 20:54.871
It allows us to create an atmosphere
of simultaneous day and night.

20:54.962 --> 20:56.873
It's a very interesting mix.

20:59.341 --> 21:00.831
Now we go to the dive bar.

21:00.926 --> 21:05.340
The dive bar was filmed
right on paseo colén,

21:05.431 --> 21:07.763
which is where it would actually be.

21:07.850 --> 21:11.058
We had to install double-pane glass
in all the windows

21:11.145 --> 21:15.935
so we could film the scene
and so the street noise

21:17.276 --> 21:19.642
wouldn't interfere with
the sound recording.

21:19.737 --> 21:24.276
And everything you see out the windows
was done by computer, too.

21:24.366 --> 21:27.199
We didn't have control over the street,

21:27.286 --> 21:30.619
so the cars that would be driving by
would be modern cars, of course.

21:30.706 --> 21:34.699
We had to put green screens
in all the windows

21:34.794 --> 21:38.628
and make the set later by computer

21:38.714 --> 21:41.205
with the cars we wanted to insert.

21:41.300 --> 21:44.633
The cars that drive by are just photos
of cars driving by,

21:44.720 --> 21:48.429
they're not 3D cars or anything.

21:51.060 --> 21:52.800
Sandoval's drunkenness...

21:54.104 --> 21:57.847
We really didn't want to fall into the
cliché of a drunk with Guillermo.

21:57.942 --> 22:00.433
He's an alcoholic,

22:00.528 --> 22:03.611
a serious alcoholic who is used to
covering up his drunkenness.

22:03.697 --> 22:06.063
He's a guy who makes deliberate moves.

22:06.158 --> 22:10.401
Look at the way he gauges the ground,
he knows where he's going to put his foot.

22:10.496 --> 22:13.408
Once he knows, he slowly gets up.

22:13.499 --> 22:18.960
He's not feeling his way with his foot,
stepping in 20 different places.

22:20.798 --> 22:23.835
You're his wife and this 1s his home.

22:24.552 --> 22:28.261
Back to 2:35, which allows

22:29.849 --> 22:31.009
for a more interesting frame,

22:31.058 --> 22:33.674
the ability to have two planes of action
at the same time.

22:33.811 --> 22:36.302
- You brought him like this.
- You mean it's my fault?

22:40.442 --> 22:45.152
Here we'll see another extreme case
of the mixture of light,

22:45.239 --> 22:49.949
of fluorescent light
with a very warm atmosphere.

22:50.035 --> 22:55.621
Everything surrounding the case,
that is, surrounding the photos of Liliana,

22:55.708 --> 22:59.621
is a cold light during filming

22:59.712 --> 23:02.795
and made green in color correction.

23:02.882 --> 23:06.795
Outside of that area,
everything is very warm and red.

23:14.393 --> 23:17.226
- Who is it?
- Benjamin esposito.

23:17.396 --> 23:20.684
- Who?
- From the courts, remember?

23:25.404 --> 23:29.363
We're back to Pablo rago's acting approach.

23:29.450 --> 23:34.444
We have to constantly plant
the seed of the ending

23:34.538 --> 23:39.498
so it seems inevitable and believable,
yet unpredictable at the same time.

23:39.585 --> 23:43.328
We really had to Gauge to what degree

23:43.422 --> 23:45.834
we should show

23:45.925 --> 23:50.089
this character's rejection
of the death penalty, for example.

23:54.099 --> 23:59.639
Some people were critical of the fact
that esposito, and I quote,

23:59.730 --> 24:04.349
"esposito knew who the killer was
because he saw him in the photos."

24:04.443 --> 24:06.775
I'd like to comment on this.

24:06.862 --> 24:11.026
Anyone who has worked with police officers
and people from the courts,

24:11.116 --> 24:15.325
who is used to dealing
with those types of people,

24:15.412 --> 24:17.152
begins to develop an instinct.

24:17.247 --> 24:22.833
This instinct is very difficult to describe
and to explain.

24:22.920 --> 24:26.083
In a later scene, esposito says,
"I don't know how I know."

24:26.799 --> 24:29.632
Also, what esposito sees here
isn't the murderer,

24:29.718 --> 24:32.050
but rather a suspect, something strange.

24:32.137 --> 24:35.425
As a guy with 25 years of experience,

24:35.516 --> 24:39.885
he sees something
that seems abnormal in his world,

24:39.979 --> 24:42.345
a world in which he has seen
many cases like this

24:42.439 --> 24:44.270
and many photos like this.

24:44.984 --> 24:49.603
This is by no means
beyond the realm of the credible.

24:50.531 --> 24:54.399
No one with experience
in this kind of work,

24:54.493 --> 24:58.236
in courts or the police,
had any problem with it.

24:58.330 --> 25:03.074
It's just a comment made by those
who perhaps aren't familiar with

25:03.168 --> 25:06.660
that world and how it operates.

25:10.050 --> 25:12.507
Those are from when
shewas 17 or 18.

25:14.054 --> 25:15.510
That's the spring picnic...

25:15.597 --> 25:17.508
In chivilcoy. Ever been there?

25:17.599 --> 25:21.763
It's also completely related
to the theme of the movie,

25:21.854 --> 25:24.561
which is that the eyes speak.

25:24.648 --> 25:30.063
The intention behind the camera operation

25:30.154 --> 25:33.612
and the choice of shot sizes in the movie

25:33.699 --> 25:37.442
is that if we listened to the dialogue
with our eyes closed,

25:37.536 --> 25:40.903
we'd be listening to one movie.

25:40.998 --> 25:45.458
Now, if we muted it
and saw only the characters' eyes,

25:45.544 --> 25:48.206
we'd be watching a different movie.

25:48.297 --> 25:53.667
There is always a huge difference
between what the characters say

25:53.761 --> 25:57.470
and what their eyes reveal
that they're thinking.

25:57.556 --> 26:01.219
It's a fundamental and recurring theme
in the movie

26:02.561 --> 26:08.648
that you'll see in full in the next scene,
where this theory is presented.

26:08.734 --> 26:11.771
It guided the camera design in the movie.

26:11.862 --> 26:16.276
Later on, we'll see shots of only eyes

26:16.366 --> 26:21.235
where we were able to isolate the eyes
by framing them with different things.

26:26.043 --> 26:28.250
- Do you know who this is?
- Let me see.

26:28.420 --> 26:31.082
He's in several. Looking at her.

26:31.548 --> 26:34.255
I showed Liliana this system.
Otherwise years pass and you forget...

26:34.343 --> 26:39.337
This is the end of the first act, in which we
introduced all the characters and conflicts,

26:39.431 --> 26:41.513
and perhaps even the antagonist.

26:41.600 --> 26:45.969
We end the act with the movie's leitmotif,

26:46.063 --> 26:48.395
an extreme close-up shot of the eyes,

26:48.482 --> 26:52.270
the first one in the movie.

26:53.821 --> 26:57.905
We could say
that the curtain falls on the first act.

27:07.793 --> 27:09.909
We come back to desaturated colors.

27:10.003 --> 27:11.003
Well?

27:12.047 --> 27:14.083
I always thought
the photo thing was crazy.

27:14.383 --> 27:17.466
Yeah, but I think...

27:17.636 --> 27:19.342
It's the look in their eyes.

27:19.429 --> 27:20.794
That's the key.

27:21.723 --> 27:26.717
Irene's character reveals
nothing of her life,

27:26.812 --> 27:28.803
but her eyes tell us everything.

27:30.691 --> 27:32.056
It's worth watching.

27:38.282 --> 27:39.943
They bullshit too.

27:40.325 --> 27:41.325
They should keep quiet.

27:43.495 --> 27:44.855
Sometimes it's better not to look.

27:49.168 --> 27:51.830
What?
We never talked about this case.

27:52.880 --> 27:54.211
When did you come from jujuy?

27:54.298 --> 27:55.834
In '85.

27:55.924 --> 27:57.289
Why now?

27:58.510 --> 27:59.966
It's better than planting begonias.

28:01.346 --> 28:02.506
Why?

28:06.727 --> 28:08.718
Because I've been sidetracked
for over 20 years.

28:09.521 --> 28:12.684
Esposito will say,
"I know it doesn't happen to you."

28:13.942 --> 28:18.527
And Irene, without doing anything,
responds with her eyes.

28:18.614 --> 28:21.777
It's a truly great bit of acting.

28:21.867 --> 28:26.406
It's as though she were shouting,
"no, you're wrong. It does happen to me!"

28:26.997 --> 28:28.282
And I saw myself...

28:28.498 --> 28:30.034
Having dinner alone...

28:32.044 --> 28:33.454
And I didn't like myself.

28:35.088 --> 28:36.368
I know it doesn't happen to you.

28:36.423 --> 28:38.914
I'm not asking you to understand,
but believe me.

28:40.802 --> 28:42.383
And in trying to...

28:43.055 --> 28:45.387
Find the reasons...

28:46.225 --> 28:47.715
The moments...

28:48.185 --> 28:51.677
Everything, absolutely everything
leads me to morales.

28:52.147 --> 28:54.263
It's as if my life had...

28:57.694 --> 28:59.855
- Answer it.
- It's Alfonso, I'll call him back.

28:59.947 --> 29:02.029
- Answer it, I'll Walt.
- I'll call him back.

29:02.115 --> 29:03.855
It's no problem, answer it.

29:07.371 --> 29:08.371
Hi.

29:08.455 --> 29:11.913
I'm finishing up here,
I'll be right there.

29:13.085 --> 29:14.541
Start without me...

29:14.753 --> 29:16.539
And we return to the past.

29:22.594 --> 29:24.209
Hello?

29:24.304 --> 29:26.260
Good evening.
Does isidoro Gomez live there?

29:26.932 --> 29:28.092
Yes.

29:28.183 --> 29:31.175
Some might think this scene
violates the code of the movie

29:31.270 --> 29:35.730
since everything is from esposito"s memory

29:35.816 --> 29:38.023
and he isn't in this scene.

29:38.110 --> 29:44.026
But not everything he remembers
is something he experienced firsthand.

29:44.116 --> 29:47.153
Others told him things, too, of course.

29:47.244 --> 29:51.533
We assume
that morales called him the next day

29:51.623 --> 29:56.458
and said, "look, I called Gomez's mother,
and she said this and that."

29:56.545 --> 30:02.165
So there's no reason he couldn't have
imagined or described this scene.

30:02.384 --> 30:04.612
Do you know where I can find him?
Have you got an address?

30:04.636 --> 30:06.843
This job is pretty urgent.

30:08.140 --> 30:10.631
The progression of Pablo rago's character,

30:10.726 --> 30:14.935
the way his methodical side

30:15.022 --> 30:18.935
initially tries to control the scene

30:19.026 --> 30:22.109
while his passionate side
gradually overtakes him,

30:22.195 --> 30:24.857
is great acting.

30:24.948 --> 30:29.112
Filming this scene with cuts
would've ruined it.

30:29.619 --> 30:31.280
What type of job is it?

30:31.371 --> 30:33.202
It's...

30:34.166 --> 30:37.078
A job that will interest him.

30:37.169 --> 30:38.830
It's for councilman Mendez and...

30:38.920 --> 30:42.083
His performance builds up

30:42.174 --> 30:45.382
such that you need to watch
the whole process develop

30:47.137 --> 30:51.972
to appreciate the greatness of the moment,
to appreciate his skill as an actor.

30:52.059 --> 30:54.675
They used to see each other.
She's from here.

30:54.770 --> 30:55.850
Why?

30:56.104 --> 30:59.813
To help us concentrate better on the scene,

30:59.900 --> 31:04.109
Gomez's wife,
I mean Gomez's mother, was on the phone

31:04.196 --> 31:07.108
in the apartment
next to where we were filming,

31:07.199 --> 31:10.282
and they were actually having
this conversation we're hearing.

31:10.369 --> 31:12.485
He'll be glad to hear that.

31:12.579 --> 31:14.991
Really? Do you think
he'll remember her?

31:15.999 --> 31:17.455
Oh, yes.

31:18.418 --> 31:21.910
He really liked that girl.

31:22.005 --> 31:24.587
But then she moved away...

31:24.674 --> 31:28.713
To Buenos Aires, and they never saw
each other again.

31:31.181 --> 31:32.341
Hello?

31:33.058 --> 31:34.173
Hello?

31:35.394 --> 31:36.394
Hello?

31:43.777 --> 31:44.812
If he's here...

31:44.903 --> 31:47.144
It's a miracle. Schmuck.

31:47.239 --> 31:51.152
- Imagine losing the love of your life.
- Not him, you.

31:51.243 --> 31:54.326
If you'd kept your mouth shut
and called me first...

31:54.413 --> 31:55.903
Morning. We're looking for...

31:55.997 --> 31:57.203
Isidoro Gomez.

31:58.166 --> 31:59.781
What is it? Who are you guys?

31:59.876 --> 32:00.991
Mike hammer, asshole.

32:01.086 --> 32:03.498
- Did he come to work?
- No, he didn't.

32:03.588 --> 32:04.828
We know nothing about him.

32:04.923 --> 32:06.538
Get me his address.

32:06.633 --> 32:07.839
Right away.

32:07.926 --> 32:09.962
Fernandez! Fernandez!

32:14.891 --> 32:16.251
There's a character moment here...

32:16.309 --> 32:19.472
What would've been
a simple transition scene...

32:20.105 --> 32:24.189
I liked closing baez's character
with a disappointment,

32:24.276 --> 32:26.187
not so much because Gomez got away,

32:26.278 --> 32:29.486
but because he wasn't the one
who figured it out, who did his job.

32:29.573 --> 32:32.610
It's like he's realizing
he's not good enough.

32:32.701 --> 32:37.035
Here, thanks to 2:35,
we can do a frame composition

32:37.122 --> 32:39.955
totally different
from what the golden section would be.

32:40.041 --> 32:43.374
The characters are on the left side
of the frame, not the right,

32:43.462 --> 32:47.876
and this gives us the sense
that everything here is wrong.

32:47.966 --> 32:50.878
They have no control over the situation.
They're powerless.

32:51.970 --> 32:54.507
If you think I'll do all that paperwork
to issue a request...

32:54.598 --> 32:56.714
The exact same thing happens here.

32:56.808 --> 32:59.641
The character should be
on the right side of the frame.

32:59.728 --> 33:02.891
Both characters should be
on the right side of the frame.

33:02.981 --> 33:05.563
Instead, the image is composed

33:05.650 --> 33:11.236
contrary to what the standards of comfort,
beauty and balance would dictate.

33:11.323 --> 33:14.190
These characters are
clearly out of balance.

33:16.953 --> 33:20.741
The chair the judge is sitting in,

33:20.832 --> 33:26.543
with the scales of justice behind him,
is actually from the courts.

33:27.506 --> 33:31.749
I don't think any art director
would've thought to put it in there.

33:31.843 --> 33:33.834
It would've seemed excessive.

33:33.970 --> 33:36.507
Anyway... the general said
what he had to.

33:36.932 --> 33:38.217
Oh, well.

33:40.352 --> 33:43.810
The premeditated movement again,
the hand looking for the glass.

33:43.897 --> 33:46.013
The hand that considers
where the glass is first,

33:46.107 --> 33:49.190
calculates its movement and then takes it,

33:49.277 --> 33:52.769
instead of grasping at the air
like your typical drunk in a movie.

33:52.864 --> 33:54.729
Morales is getting worse every day...

33:55.867 --> 33:57.653
The murderer knows we're after him...

33:59.079 --> 34:00.660
My judge is a moron...

34:01.373 --> 34:03.034
I want to kill Irene...

34:04.209 --> 34:08.202
This is another frame composition
that deviates from the norm.

34:08.295 --> 34:11.333
Usually, the largest element in the shot,

34:11.424 --> 34:15.132
in this case francella's face,

34:15.219 --> 34:18.053
would be in focus,
and the other element would be smaller.

34:18.931 --> 34:22.594
If you wanted to see Ricardo speaking
in focus,

34:22.686 --> 34:27.679
you'd try to frame him
so that francella's character would be

34:28.775 --> 34:32.438
way to the right,
we'd see from his glasses forward

34:32.529 --> 34:34.565
and we'd see Ricardo's face clearly.

34:35.574 --> 34:40.989
This way, we not only stuck to
our intention of conveying,

34:41.079 --> 34:47.621
subliminally, that the characters
have no control over what's going on,

34:47.918 --> 34:52.504
but the passive attitude
of francella's character,

34:52.591 --> 34:55.458
who is listening, listening,

34:56.261 --> 34:59.503
also starts to take on a dramatic weight

34:59.598 --> 35:02.010
that is far more powerful
than if he were a mere reference.

35:02.100 --> 35:05.638
Also, the characters are together 100%,
there's no distance between them.

35:07.105 --> 35:09.562
They're in this adventure together.

35:14.446 --> 35:15.652
I gotta pee.

35:16.281 --> 35:17.521
Hold on.

35:18.408 --> 35:20.740
The old lady has to come out
at some point.

35:21.995 --> 35:26.113
Too much Napoleon solo and Perry Mason.
That's your problem.

35:30.462 --> 35:35.422
Again, we have a mixture of red,
like the upholstery in the car,

35:35.508 --> 35:39.000
and the daylight, which is green.

35:39.095 --> 35:42.053
All the elements...
You can see the shopping bag.

35:42.140 --> 35:44.802
All the red elements

35:44.893 --> 35:49.557
contrast with the green of the daylight.

35:56.279 --> 35:59.066
In this scene we're about to watch,

35:59.157 --> 36:02.695
you'll be able to see the reds

36:02.786 --> 36:08.156
and that palette of reds and Greens,
but taken to its fullest expression.

36:08.249 --> 36:12.162
This was all set to suspenseful music.

36:12.253 --> 36:14.665
Your typical suspenseful music.

36:16.049 --> 36:19.041
The sound engineer, José Luis Diaz,
composed a soundtrack

36:19.135 --> 36:23.003
with all the sounds one might hear
in a small town like this.

36:23.098 --> 36:25.089
The girl practicing piano in the distance.

36:25.183 --> 36:29.267
There was actually a kindergarten
next to this house.

36:30.063 --> 36:33.647
When we did the sound mixing,

36:33.733 --> 36:38.318
we decided to take out the music

36:40.323 --> 36:41.779
and just play around with sounds.

36:41.866 --> 36:46.986
I think that decision really did a lot
for the scene.

36:50.041 --> 36:53.374
Here, we take red and green to the extreme.

37:09.102 --> 37:12.469
Almost all the elements in this scene

37:12.564 --> 37:16.273
fall within the range
of one of those two colors.

37:22.282 --> 37:25.649
There are two ways
of reaching a suspenseful climax,

37:25.744 --> 37:30.534
like when sandoval's character is walking
in and we think it's someone else.

37:30.623 --> 37:33.410
You can accelerate the rhythm
with music, like this...

37:37.505 --> 37:40.793
That would be the conventional way.
Or you can do what we did here,

37:40.884 --> 37:44.672
which is to slowly remove
all the background noise

37:44.763 --> 37:47.220
until you can't hear anything.

37:47.307 --> 37:50.049
You don't notice it. It's very subliminal.

37:50.143 --> 37:51.553
You'll notice it now.

38:02.572 --> 38:07.362
But it produces the same feeling
of crescendo and expectation

38:07.452 --> 38:10.740
as an actual musical crescendo.

38:11.873 --> 38:17.084
Here we can see two great actors

38:17.170 --> 38:20.287
capable of combining anguish,

38:21.549 --> 38:23.665
realism and comedy in one scene.

38:25.011 --> 38:26.342
We'll let them act.

38:27.680 --> 38:28.680
The letters.

38:28.807 --> 38:31.594
The letters, but no...
Come here.

38:31.684 --> 38:32.969
There's no address.

38:33.061 --> 38:35.643
The envelopes are gone.
There's no address.

38:38.066 --> 38:40.398
- This one's from the other day.
- So?

38:41.653 --> 38:43.484
It's recent.

38:44.155 --> 38:45.361
The trash.

38:45.448 --> 38:47.814
Having them in the same frame
is unbelievable.

38:54.833 --> 38:55.993
No, nothing here.

38:58.044 --> 39:01.878
The layout of this house
was truly heaven-sent.

39:01.965 --> 39:04.126
Being able to stand in a doorway

39:04.217 --> 39:07.960
and see the depth
of the entire house was incredible.

39:08.972 --> 39:13.386
It was a real find by federico noejovich,
our location production manager.

39:19.816 --> 39:21.352
What is it?

39:22.277 --> 39:23.517
Go on, go on.

39:24.696 --> 39:26.027
What is it? What?

39:26.114 --> 39:31.529
Come here.
Calm down, I'll let you out.

39:31.619 --> 39:35.862
I swear that no animal was harmed
in the making of this movie.

39:40.712 --> 39:42.748
That was done by computer.

39:46.843 --> 39:48.128
Want me to drive?

39:50.305 --> 39:53.138
The dog probably had rabies,
you're gonna die.

39:53.224 --> 39:56.933
Why didn't you keep watch?
If she finds out we broke in...

39:57.020 --> 39:58.510
Benjamin, as soon as...

39:58.605 --> 40:03.315
More great timing by Guillermo and Ricardo.

40:03.401 --> 40:05.858
Let's enjoy this because it's rare.

40:08.448 --> 40:11.235
You weren't stupid enough
to bring them, were you?

40:15.371 --> 40:18.363
And what if I did?

40:18.458 --> 40:20.574
What if? What if?

40:20.668 --> 40:26.004
If she finds out, she'll tell Gomez
and the guy will disappear for good.

40:26.090 --> 40:27.796
- Don't you see?
- No.

40:27.884 --> 40:29.340
You don't? You're fucking blind!

40:29.427 --> 40:30.667
Because you...

40:30.762 --> 40:35.426
You'll see, when I finally figure out
the whole thing out about the date...

40:35.600 --> 40:38.342
I'd much rather work alone!

40:40.939 --> 40:45.399
Here we'll see that perspective again

40:45.485 --> 40:48.568
of hiding in a corner

40:48.655 --> 40:52.239
and observing everything from there,
through the objects.

40:52.325 --> 40:56.659
The shot starts up above
so we see all the letters spread out,

40:56.746 --> 41:02.332
but we gradually start to take
the perspective of one person

41:02.418 --> 41:04.955
and we don't change it with cuts
or anything.

41:05.672 --> 41:08.539
This makes us feel like we're there.

41:08.633 --> 41:13.718
When we have to move our head
to see around a lamp

41:13.805 --> 41:18.344
or past a stack of files,
we're becoming involved in the movie.

41:18.434 --> 41:19.970
People from chivilcoy.

41:21.312 --> 41:24.600
Here, let me see. Oh, shit...

41:26.484 --> 41:28.691
Sperm bank, loan department.
Good morning.

41:29.779 --> 41:31.465
No, it's a sperm bank.
Deposit or withdrawal?

41:31.489 --> 41:34.231
- Esposito. Sandoval.
- Wrong number.

41:34.325 --> 41:35.815
Sandoval.

41:36.244 --> 41:39.361
I love using the full width
of the frame in 2:35,

41:39.455 --> 41:43.494
having characters in both points
of the frame.

41:46.170 --> 41:50.254
This is a sequence shot where we also see
the red and green in full.

41:50.341 --> 41:54.380
In fact, it is in this office,
the office of judge Maria Gabriela lanz,

41:54.470 --> 41:58.588
who was kind enough to loan us her court
for filming,

41:58.683 --> 42:01.265
that the mixture of Greens and reds
begins to develop

42:01.352 --> 42:04.139
because everything you see here
is part of the set.

42:04.230 --> 42:07.643
You can see the green upholstery
with the red wood, for example,

42:07.734 --> 42:11.727
which is what inspired the movie's palette.

42:12.030 --> 42:15.488
That means what I say isn't worth
a bucket of shit.

42:16.284 --> 42:18.650
A great job by Mario alarcon.

42:20.371 --> 42:24.910
This is another scene
which gradually develops its humor

42:25.001 --> 42:30.541
in a showball effect in real time,
because there are no cuts.

42:32.508 --> 42:35.250
This wouldn't have been the case

42:35.344 --> 42:38.632
if, for example,
we had cut to Ricardo's reaction

42:38.723 --> 42:40.554
to see what was going on.

42:40.641 --> 42:44.759
This works well
because we didn't stop in any one shot.

42:45.396 --> 42:47.682
A black peugeot was parked...

42:47.774 --> 42:53.110
With a Buenos Aires license plate
number 133-809...

42:53.196 --> 42:54.982
And my colleague asks
the federal police...

42:55.073 --> 42:58.236
The presence of Guillermo's character,
out of focus,

42:58.326 --> 43:01.068
but in a strategic part
of the screen aims to...

43:01.537 --> 43:06.702
He's the edge of a triangle.
The judge and esposito are the base

43:06.793 --> 43:12.129
and sandoval is at the other apex,
drawing our gaze.

43:12.215 --> 43:16.128
We're listening to the judge, but watching
sandoval, even though he's out of focus.

43:24.894 --> 43:25.974
Fo?

43:28.439 --> 43:31.272
Sandoval is the audience right now.

43:31.359 --> 43:36.570
He's holding back laughter.
We can laugh, but he's holding it back.

43:36.656 --> 43:38.772
This was planned, of course.

43:39.117 --> 43:43.360
To see if I can clear things up.
And the truth is, esposito, I can't.

43:43.454 --> 43:45.820
Because I don't look like
a judge anymore...

43:45.915 --> 43:48.452
I look like a first class
fucking idiot.

43:48.543 --> 43:53.333
Because I say I want a
and people give me z.

43:53.422 --> 43:56.539
I can't even watch this scene
without laughing.

43:59.971 --> 44:01.552
Excuse me, sir, but...

44:03.432 --> 44:05.138
I think something weird
is going on here.

44:05.226 --> 44:06.557
Again, we see...

44:07.812 --> 44:12.226
In a world where all the characters

44:12.316 --> 44:16.355
wear gray, black and brown,

44:16.445 --> 44:20.609
all colors from a very muted,
monochromatic palette,

44:20.700 --> 44:26.070
Irene, by contrast,
is always a source of color.

44:26.164 --> 44:27.404
Or that one of them was seen...

44:27.498 --> 44:31.992
Tying his shoelaces
when he was wearing loafers.

44:32.670 --> 44:37.289
What stood out most was that one of them
walked into the grocery store...

44:37.383 --> 44:39.499
Greeted them pleasantly...

44:39.594 --> 44:44.714
Asked for a bottle of whiskey and left
drinking straight from the bottle.

44:45.600 --> 44:47.841
Shall I describe him for you?

44:48.519 --> 44:50.350
We have to deny it, Benjamin.

44:50.438 --> 44:53.225
"It wasn't me, I don't know..."

44:53.316 --> 44:56.274
Don't ever talk to me again.
Never again.

44:56.360 --> 45:01.195
It may not look like it, but a lot
of special effects went into this scene.

45:01.282 --> 45:03.819
These days,
all the paint in the courts is peeling.

45:03.910 --> 45:06.868
The paint on those columns
in the background is peeling.

45:06.954 --> 45:08.785
It wasn't like that in the '70s.

45:08.873 --> 45:14.163
Trying to fix all that on the computer
created a domino effect of special effects.

45:14.253 --> 45:17.165
For example, we had to reproduce
the breath vapor

45:17.256 --> 45:19.747
that comes out of esposito"s mouth,

45:19.842 --> 45:24.586
because when we erased the original color
of the columns, the vapor got erased, too.

45:27.058 --> 45:28.923
That sort of thing.

45:29.018 --> 45:34.183
We had to erase a fire extinguisher
on a wall,

45:34.273 --> 45:38.642
but then we had to reproduce shadows.

45:38.736 --> 45:43.776
It's not that easy.
You say, "okay, let's erase it,"

45:43.866 --> 45:47.984
but sometimes you forget
that everything in front of that object

45:48.079 --> 45:51.663
also gets erased
and then has to be reproduced.

45:51.749 --> 45:55.708
Only one reference to a woman,
Rosa, apparently an aunt.

45:57.380 --> 46:00.087
That's it. That's all I've got.
The rest is nothing.

46:00.174 --> 46:02.381
- Benjamin.
- This is nothing too?

46:02.468 --> 46:04.254
Please.

46:15.481 --> 46:16.891
Leave it open, it isn't private.

46:18.609 --> 46:20.349
I talked to fortuna.

46:20.444 --> 46:22.685
I explained that you're an imbecile.

46:22.780 --> 46:23.799
I used my irresistible smile...

46:23.823 --> 46:26.781
The use of frame composition again.

46:26.867 --> 46:32.578
The person in control is well-placed,
on the left side of the frame...

46:32.665 --> 46:37.034
It's Irene, with all the space
to the right, where it should be.

46:38.170 --> 46:41.207
And the person who is not in control
is on the right side of the frame,

46:41.299 --> 46:43.039
in the larger plane, of course.

46:45.553 --> 46:48.090
Of course not.
I save it for my boyfriend, as I should.

46:48.180 --> 46:51.297
There's the red element
in Irene's clothing.

46:52.059 --> 46:53.139
Right.

46:54.312 --> 46:56.394
I won't take any more of your time.

46:56.480 --> 47:00.268
And bring me the Liliana coloto file,
to seal it and archive it.

47:05.865 --> 47:07.480
The case is closed.

47:16.834 --> 47:20.167
Getting engaged.
Kids today laugh at it.

47:20.254 --> 47:22.085
Who gets engaged anymore?

47:22.840 --> 47:24.501
We return to the present

47:26.427 --> 47:28.213
and to pale colors,

47:29.555 --> 47:32.718
except for Irene's red element.

47:34.852 --> 47:38.640
This is a good time to point out
Alex mathews' make-up.

47:38.731 --> 47:42.098
We can all see it

47:42.193 --> 47:45.310
in Ricardo's face,

47:45.404 --> 47:50.068
those perfect wrinkles that stand up
to the most extreme close-up,

47:50.159 --> 47:55.699
but also the subtlety of the makeup
on Irene's neck.

47:55.790 --> 48:00.329
Those tiny little wrinkles on her neck.

48:01.045 --> 48:04.537
The subtlest thing

48:04.632 --> 48:07.499
around her eyes is really remarkable.

48:07.593 --> 48:13.304
This is complemented
by soledad villamil's acting, of course.

48:13.391 --> 48:17.350
Her whole attitude changes
from the past to the present.

48:17.436 --> 48:21.770
In the past, she's a girl,
a scared rookie in a man's world

48:21.857 --> 48:23.973
who doesn't know how to assert herself,

48:24.068 --> 48:28.562
and who may not have a strong sense
of self-awareness.

48:28.656 --> 48:32.990
In the present, she's a
judge in her element

48:33.077 --> 48:36.285
who is used to controlling her territory.

48:37.123 --> 48:38.659
I was another person.

48:53.347 --> 48:55.258
Your novel might be really good.

48:56.517 --> 48:57.927
But it's not for me.

49:00.604 --> 49:04.973
You've reached the end of your life
and you want to look back.

49:05.985 --> 49:07.316
But I can't.

49:08.279 --> 49:10.986
I have to go to work every day.

49:12.450 --> 49:15.658
And live with this.
It may not be true justice...

49:15.744 --> 49:17.655
But it's a kind of justice.

49:19.790 --> 49:22.281
And at the end of the day
I have to go home...

49:23.085 --> 49:24.621
And live with my husband...

49:25.754 --> 49:27.710
And with my children,
who I adore.

49:30.676 --> 49:33.042
My whole life I've looked forward.

49:35.639 --> 49:38.176
The past is out of my jurisdiction.

49:38.309 --> 49:40.140
I declare myself incompetent.

49:48.944 --> 49:50.684
What a case, Jesus Christ.

49:52.156 --> 49:53.862
It never dies.

50:09.340 --> 50:12.298
We filmed this scene in retiro station
in half an hour

50:12.384 --> 50:14.420
because they were
practically kicking us out.

50:14.512 --> 50:17.720
It was a Saturday afternoon,
almost nighttime,

50:17.806 --> 50:20.218
and the station was starting to fill up.

50:22.061 --> 50:24.302
This is one of my favorite scenes.

50:27.024 --> 50:29.515
Pablo rago does an exceptional job here.

50:29.610 --> 50:33.398
I think we get the feeling that he's a man
on the verge of madness,

50:33.489 --> 50:35.775
but isn't quite there yet.

50:37.493 --> 50:43.705
For me, this is the most disturbing scene
for this character.

50:44.542 --> 50:45.907
Yes.

50:51.048 --> 50:52.333
How are things?

50:52.883 --> 50:54.194
This month I'm here Tuesdays and...

50:54.218 --> 50:56.755
Once again, we see those frames
where the layout

50:56.845 --> 51:00.884
and architecture of the place dominate.

51:02.893 --> 51:07.557
It's a story about two small men
in a huge place, teeming with people.

51:08.566 --> 51:13.981
This was one of the images
I began the treatment of the movie with.

51:14.071 --> 51:15.481
Looking at retiro station,

51:15.573 --> 51:20.067
noticing that all these scenes are set
in huge places.

51:20.160 --> 51:23.823
We see retiro station, a huge place

51:23.914 --> 51:28.123
with 1,000 or 500 people walking around.

51:28.210 --> 51:29.370
A swarm of people.

51:29.461 --> 51:34.501
What would happen if we could suddenly
cut to a close-up of the eyes

51:34.592 --> 51:36.332
of one of those people?

51:36.427 --> 51:39.169
What story would their eyes tell us?

51:39.263 --> 51:43.757
That was the premise
for the treatment of the movie.

51:44.893 --> 51:48.932
That combination of huge places
and close-ups of eyes.

51:51.984 --> 51:55.568
I think Pablo's expression here adds depth.

51:55.654 --> 51:57.940
We don't know if he's crazy,

51:59.617 --> 52:03.280
if he's serious, if he's human,
if he's a man in love...

52:06.707 --> 52:08.243
Then I start having doubts...

52:09.084 --> 52:12.201
And I don't remember if it was lemon
or honey in the tea.

52:14.131 --> 52:16.484
And I don't know if it's a memory
or a memory of a memory...

52:16.508 --> 52:20.000
Until this point,
when we're moved by his pain.

52:32.483 --> 52:33.483
Excuse me.

52:34.109 --> 52:36.475
This is one of my favorite scenes
in the movie.

52:36.570 --> 52:40.154
I'm going to say something quickly
and let you watch it.

52:40.240 --> 52:43.232
In this scene, the idea that
a person's eyes tell one story

52:43.327 --> 52:46.410
while his words tell another is crucial.

52:46.497 --> 52:52.242
Also, all the storylines are addressed
at the same time.

52:52.336 --> 52:56.079
The story of the crime progresses,

52:56.173 --> 52:58.414
the love story progresses,

52:58.509 --> 53:01.000
the story of Pablo rago progresses.

53:03.180 --> 53:05.592
It functions
on all those levels simultaneously.

53:05.683 --> 53:10.143
Thematically, it's a scene
in which all the storylines converge.

53:10.396 --> 53:13.012
Go on. Yes.

53:14.525 --> 53:15.856
And I thought...

53:16.610 --> 53:18.225
"I have to talk to Irene."

53:19.113 --> 53:22.651
In terms of tone, there's romance,

53:23.534 --> 53:26.025
suspense and comedy.

53:27.079 --> 53:29.724
It's another thing that really
fascinated me while making this movie.

53:29.748 --> 53:32.660
To what point can we combine those flavors,

53:33.752 --> 53:38.712
those types of music, those rhythms
and those energies

53:38.799 --> 53:42.883
and still have
a cohesive and effective product?

53:43.387 --> 53:44.877
Excuse me, ma'am.

53:55.441 --> 53:57.477
I ran into morales yesterday
at the train station.

53:59.236 --> 54:00.567
Know what he was doing?

54:01.405 --> 54:02.986
My crystal ball is broken.

54:05.743 --> 54:09.577
He goes to the terminals every day
looking for the killer.

54:09.663 --> 54:12.780
Every single day after working
at the bank.

54:13.417 --> 54:16.659
There's also a small
detail here of the Rose,

54:16.754 --> 54:20.588
which looks like it's on esposito's lapel.

54:21.008 --> 54:24.751
It's as if his wife's death
just left him there...

54:24.928 --> 54:26.964
Stuck in time forever.

54:28.891 --> 54:30.927
You should see his eyes.

54:32.936 --> 54:35.177
They're in a state of pure love.

54:36.690 --> 54:38.726
Can you imagine a love like that?

54:38.817 --> 54:42.435
Unaffected by the wear and tear
of the routine?

54:45.949 --> 54:47.689
Speak for yourself,
I don't know about that.

54:52.831 --> 54:54.867
We think the guy...

54:54.958 --> 54:57.415
Deserves another chance, ma'am.

55:00.255 --> 55:01.335
Where do I come in?

55:01.757 --> 55:02.872
The case is closed.

55:02.966 --> 55:04.331
We'd have to reopen it.

55:06.637 --> 55:09.094
You're asking me to destroy
an official document...

55:09.181 --> 55:11.797
With mine and the judge's
signature on it...

55:12.309 --> 55:14.721
And to falsify statements and dates...

55:14.812 --> 55:17.724
So it will look like the case
is still open?

55:17.815 --> 55:21.182
- That's a brilliant idea. We hadn't...
- Don't fuck with me.

55:42.589 --> 55:45.422
I think that the scene we just saw

55:45.509 --> 55:51.004
makes a very strong case
for working with actors.

55:53.809 --> 55:55.049
Tell me.

55:55.269 --> 55:58.102
Did you see a stack of letters
on my desk?

55:58.188 --> 55:59.268
No.

56:01.108 --> 56:02.188
Sandoval?

56:02.442 --> 56:03.648
He left down talcahuano.

56:03.735 --> 56:05.396
The case is reopened.

56:13.203 --> 56:16.161
Not only do you sneak off to get drunk,
you also steal evidence.

56:16.248 --> 56:18.079
Everything's under control.

56:18.166 --> 56:20.077
Here comes the scene about passion.

56:20.168 --> 56:21.283
Hands off. Are you nuts?

56:21.378 --> 56:22.458
We're going back.

56:22.546 --> 56:28.963
This is actually another system
commonly used by police and detectives

56:29.052 --> 56:32.636
for finding missing people.

56:32.723 --> 56:38.263
Learning what that person loves most,
what his vices and passions are,

56:38.353 --> 56:40.969
because those things are
very hard to change.

56:41.064 --> 56:44.147
For example,
if a person is addicted to gambling,

56:44.234 --> 56:48.853
he can drop off the radar,
but he'll take that addiction with him.

56:48.947 --> 56:53.907
The same thing happens here,
and we draw a sort of metaphor

56:53.994 --> 56:58.078
for the main theme of the movie, passions.

56:58.916 --> 57:00.281
The passions that control us.

57:00.375 --> 57:03.082
And I started thinking about guys.

57:03.837 --> 57:09.002
Guys in general.
Not just this guy, but...

57:09.092 --> 57:11.253
Guys in general.

57:11.845 --> 57:13.631
A guy.

57:15.432 --> 57:18.094
A guy can do anything
to be different.

57:18.852 --> 57:23.095
But there's one thing he can't change.
Not him, not you, not anybody.

57:24.608 --> 57:25.768
Take me, for example.

57:25.859 --> 57:28.441
Great acting by Guillermo francella...

57:29.112 --> 57:31.398
I have a good job,
a wife who loves me...

57:32.282 --> 57:35.900
With Ricardo's reactions,

57:35.994 --> 57:39.828
which are a perfect and subtle emphasis.

57:39.915 --> 57:41.496
"Why are you here, Pablo?"

57:42.751 --> 57:43.751
You know why, Benjamin?

57:43.877 --> 57:46.289
The rhythm of the scene is slow.

57:46.380 --> 57:51.670
The cadenza of this scene is piano,

57:51.760 --> 57:53.967
to put it in musical terms. Pianissimo.

57:55.472 --> 57:56.837
Two scenes later...

57:56.932 --> 58:02.802
I'm saying this because I'll explain why
we filmed the stadium scene the way we did.

58:03.355 --> 58:07.314
Two scenes later,
we're in an interrogation scene

58:07.401 --> 58:10.814
that lasts about 10 minutes.

58:11.780 --> 58:14.988
It's an intimate scene
with just three people,

58:15.075 --> 58:19.409
very little happens,
and it's set in an enclosed space.

58:19.496 --> 58:21.236
This scene is the same way.

58:21.331 --> 58:27.577
The energy curve of the movie
is going down, down,

58:27.671 --> 58:34.167
and we had to fulfill several functions
with the stadium scene.

58:35.137 --> 58:38.379
They had to find the man, of course.

58:38.473 --> 58:42.933
That's the narrative function,
its function in the script.

58:43.020 --> 58:48.811
But as viewers, we should also feel
a surge of energy at that moment.

58:48.900 --> 58:52.563
I needed to make viewers feel
what the characters feel,

58:52.654 --> 58:55.441
anguish and adrenaline.

58:55.532 --> 58:57.864
In a short span of time...

58:59.911 --> 59:01.697
Like a sandwich,

59:01.788 --> 59:05.280
between two low-energy scenes.

59:07.711 --> 59:09.576
So how do we do that?

59:09.671 --> 59:15.211
We'll see how this scene ends...
We'll resume when the stadium scene starts.

59:15.927 --> 59:18.213
"As anido with mesias."

59:18.305 --> 59:21.547
Anido and mesias, backs on the club
that won it all in '61.

59:21.641 --> 59:23.381
Negri at goalie, anido and mesias.

59:23.518 --> 59:26.555
Blanco, peano and sacchi.
Corbatta, pizzuti...

59:27.022 --> 59:29.013
Mansilla, sosa and Belen.

59:29.274 --> 59:32.812
"Don't worry about me.
I'm like manfredini...

59:32.903 --> 59:35.315
Not bavastro." Notary?

59:35.405 --> 59:37.191
Pedro waldemar manfredini.

59:37.282 --> 59:41.275
Racing paid peanuts for him
and he ended up being...

59:41.369 --> 59:45.533
An extraordinary player.
Incredible.

59:45.624 --> 59:47.990
Julio bavastro, right forward.

59:48.085 --> 59:52.169
Played only two matches
between '62 and '63 without scoring.

59:52.255 --> 59:54.371
Quote: "Il don't want
to end up like Sanchez."

59:54.466 --> 59:56.457
Who's he talking about?

59:56.551 --> 01:00:00.965
He can only mean the goalie,
ataulfo Sanchez.

01:00:01.056 --> 01:00:02.967
Eternal benchwarmer.

01:00:03.058 --> 01:00:07.848
He played only 17 matches
between '57 and '61.

01:00:07.938 --> 01:00:10.429
Notary, what is racing to you?

01:00:10.524 --> 01:00:11.889
A passion.

01:00:11.983 --> 01:00:13.848
Even after nine years
without a championship?

01:00:13.944 --> 01:00:16.185
A passion is a passion.

01:00:16.279 --> 01:00:17.644
You see, Benjamin?

01:00:17.739 --> 01:00:23.325
A guy can change anything.
His face, his home, his family...

01:00:23.411 --> 01:00:27.575
His girlfriend, his religion, his god.

01:00:27.666 --> 01:00:30.783
But there's one thing he can't change.

01:00:30.877 --> 01:00:31.912
He can't change...

01:00:32.003 --> 01:00:33.288
His passion.

01:00:34.506 --> 01:00:36.087
And here we are.

01:00:36.174 --> 01:00:38.665
A movie's energy curve is made up of

01:00:38.760 --> 01:00:41.593
moments of Harmony
and moments of change.

01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:43.045
Moments of Harmony,

01:00:43.140 --> 01:00:46.724
when we maintain
the same energy and style,

01:00:46.810 --> 01:00:49.802
make us feel at ease.

01:00:49.896 --> 01:00:53.639
They make us feel comfortable,
like we can follow the story.

01:00:53.733 --> 01:00:56.566
But moments of change
are the ones that excite us.

01:00:56.653 --> 01:01:00.362
They give us a surge of adrenaline
and pique our interest.

01:01:00.448 --> 01:01:05.363
Too much Harmony in a movie is boring.
Too much change is incoherent.

01:01:05.453 --> 01:01:11.039
We were coming off two intimate scenes
and we needed a surge of energy.

01:01:11.126 --> 01:01:16.211
We start with the cliché establishing shot
of the stadium, which was deliberate.

01:01:16.298 --> 01:01:20.382
Usually, viewers are
used to going to a cut.

01:01:20.468 --> 01:01:23.676
And here, we keep going and going
and going

01:01:23.763 --> 01:01:26.425
and going and going

01:01:26.516 --> 01:01:29.724
and going and we don't stop.

01:01:29.811 --> 01:01:32.598
The camera pauses at Ricardo
and keeps going.

01:01:32.689 --> 01:01:36.307
Those 30 seconds

01:01:36.401 --> 01:01:40.440
make us, the viewers,
feel like we we're sitting right there.

01:01:40.530 --> 01:01:44.443
We're in another world,
seeing something else, immersed,

01:01:44.534 --> 01:01:47.116
just another fan in the crowd.

01:01:47.204 --> 01:01:49.911
We never would've been
able to achieve this with a cut.

01:01:49.998 --> 01:01:51.989
It isn't a whim.

01:01:52.083 --> 01:01:57.498
It's the way to achieve, to its fullest,

01:01:57.589 --> 01:02:03.129
a sense of involvement in the scene,
the surge of energy we feel.

01:02:03.220 --> 01:02:07.930
If we had cut to this, if we had...

01:02:08.016 --> 01:02:09.381
Here, for example,

01:02:09.476 --> 01:02:12.809
we're a guy standing next to them
as francella says, "there he is!"

01:02:12.896 --> 01:02:17.640
We turn our head
and start walking behind them.

01:02:17.734 --> 01:02:20.316
And the whole time we're just
another person in the stadium.

01:02:20.403 --> 01:02:22.735
People even bump into us.

01:02:23.740 --> 01:02:24.900
Here.

01:02:25.909 --> 01:02:27.445
We're just another person.

01:02:28.411 --> 01:02:32.996
We were able to do all that
because we went from the aerial shot

01:02:33.083 --> 01:02:35.290
to the stands without a cut.

01:02:35.377 --> 01:02:37.584
And here again,

01:02:39.256 --> 01:02:43.295
every time we expect a cut,
it keeps going and going.

01:02:45.387 --> 01:02:50.097
We're the spectator who went walking
the other way and stops next to Gomez,

01:02:50.183 --> 01:02:53.892
shouting to the others,
"hey, man, he's over here."

01:03:01.569 --> 01:03:04.902
We knew that a lot of people
would expect a cut here,

01:03:04.990 --> 01:03:07.823
when the camera moves, so we made sure

01:03:08.785 --> 01:03:13.905
that either Guillermo or Ricardo
were onscreen at all times.

01:03:18.086 --> 01:03:22.625
And we start running. We're just
another person chasing after this guy.

01:03:22.757 --> 01:03:24.839
Gomez! Come back here!

01:03:24.926 --> 01:03:28.009
Come back here!
Don't run! Come back!

01:03:29.472 --> 01:03:30.632
Come back!

01:03:36.313 --> 01:03:40.181
Even the camera assumes
the attitude we would have

01:03:40.275 --> 01:03:42.231
if we were involved in this chase.

01:03:42.319 --> 01:03:45.982
Right here, we stay back a little.
We lose him, but...

01:03:47.240 --> 01:03:50.107
We stay back. We witness this dialogue.

01:03:51.536 --> 01:03:54.323
We're the third person
running after this guy.

01:03:57.083 --> 01:03:59.039
We climb the steps with them,

01:04:00.503 --> 01:04:02.915
we stop to hear this argument.

01:04:03.340 --> 01:04:04.650
Why didn't you give him the photo?

01:04:04.674 --> 01:04:08.212
- I did give it to him!
- Go to hell, you motherfucker!

01:04:13.099 --> 01:04:16.967
Sandoval says, "there he is,"
or gestures, and we go with him.

01:04:18.146 --> 01:04:19.556
We go to help him.

01:04:21.733 --> 01:04:23.519
Can't I take a crap in peace?

01:04:23.610 --> 01:04:27.478
We pull back a little
because we've invaded someone's privacy.

01:04:28.448 --> 01:04:30.029
Here we stop next to him.

01:04:30.116 --> 01:04:31.116
Come out!

01:04:31.201 --> 01:04:33.112
Fuck off! It's occupied!

01:04:34.204 --> 01:04:36.741
Come on out, the cops are here.
Nothing will happen to you.

01:04:36.998 --> 01:04:39.114
What police?
Quit fucking around.

01:04:39.209 --> 01:04:40.561
And when Gomez comes
from the other side,

01:04:40.585 --> 01:04:43.076
we step back so he doesn't get us.

01:04:43.171 --> 01:04:44.786
We escape from Gomez.

01:04:57.560 --> 01:04:58.891
We try to see where he went

01:04:58.978 --> 01:05:02.095
and not lose sight of the others
so we can warn them.

01:05:02.190 --> 01:05:05.398
But he comes back and we pull away again.

01:05:06.528 --> 01:05:09.144
We don't want to fight this man.

01:05:25.088 --> 01:05:30.583
As viewers, that build-up
of expecting a cut at any moment,

01:05:30.677 --> 01:05:33.714
a cut that doesn't come and doesn't come,

01:05:33.805 --> 01:05:39.391
creates a tension, an anguish,
a change in the style of the movie

01:05:42.063 --> 01:05:47.023
that an intimate scene
or arresting him at home

01:05:47.110 --> 01:05:50.102
or conventional filming techniques
could never have achieved.

01:05:53.741 --> 01:05:55.606
Sorry. How's it going?

01:05:55.702 --> 01:05:57.738
I'm waiting for sandoval.
What for?

01:05:58.246 --> 01:06:00.032
I play the nice guy,
then he comes in...

01:06:00.123 --> 01:06:02.205
I'll explain later,
it's a routine we have.

01:06:02.292 --> 01:06:05.876
Oldest trick in the book. You can't
question him without the judge.

01:06:05.962 --> 01:06:08.044
Actually, we have to pull it off
before he gets here.

01:06:08.131 --> 01:06:12.841
As a transition, we continue
as though this were the stadium,

01:06:12.927 --> 01:06:17.216
with the camera following the spectators.
We're just one of them.

01:06:19.309 --> 01:06:22.096
Naturally, we can't end this scene

01:06:22.187 --> 01:06:24.974
like the stadium scene,

01:06:25.064 --> 01:06:28.181
in a sudden, stylistic cut.

01:06:28.276 --> 01:06:30.062
It has created a lot of energy.

01:06:30.153 --> 01:06:32.860
So we continue here in single-camera style,

01:06:32.947 --> 01:06:35.654
as though we were
the companion looking on.

01:06:36.993 --> 01:06:39.735
We ease off a little, gradually,

01:06:42.332 --> 01:06:45.665
we start lowering the energy of the rhythm.

01:06:45.752 --> 01:06:50.121
Here, in this intimate moment between them,
we're ready to cut again, and it cuts.

01:06:50.215 --> 01:06:51.295
I don't know.

01:06:51.382 --> 01:06:54.499
- See?
- I don't know how I know, but I know.

01:06:54.594 --> 01:06:55.629
How?

01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:05.681
Gomez, isidoro nestor.

01:07:08.900 --> 01:07:13.564
The interrogation scene
was filmed in just one day.

01:07:13.655 --> 01:07:16.647
It's almost 15 pages long.

01:07:20.703 --> 01:07:24.992
We rehearsed this scene with the actors,

01:07:25.083 --> 01:07:27.825
but never on location.

01:07:27.919 --> 01:07:33.130
We spent an hour or two that day
rehearsing on location.

01:07:33.216 --> 01:07:38.085
Félix monti set up the lighting
so that we could film from any angle,

01:07:38.179 --> 01:07:42.138
and thanks to digital technology,
we were able...

01:07:42.225 --> 01:07:44.511
The scene lasted 12 minutes before editing.

01:07:44.602 --> 01:07:47.435
It was 12 or 13 minutes long uncut.

01:07:47.522 --> 01:07:51.686
We were able to film it
in an almost documentary style.

01:07:51.776 --> 01:07:57.612
The actors did the whole scene
from here to the end without stopping.

01:07:57.699 --> 01:08:01.738
We had two cameras, and we placed them

01:08:03.705 --> 01:08:07.539
in different parts of the room every time,

01:08:09.377 --> 01:08:13.120
the premise being to follow the action
however we could.

01:08:13.214 --> 01:08:18.834
That's why the composition is poor at
times, why we're searching for focus,

01:08:18.928 --> 01:08:23.011
why there are objects

01:08:23.099 --> 01:08:28.435
that come between us and the characters.

01:08:28.520 --> 01:08:32.981
It was filmed like a documentary,
which gives it a strong visceral quality.

01:08:35.069 --> 01:08:40.314
Here Gomez's character is well-composed,
the camera is on a tripod,

01:08:40.408 --> 01:08:45.743
and esposito"s character
is poorly composed,

01:08:45.830 --> 01:08:49.448
with a slight trembling of the camera.

01:08:51.669 --> 01:08:55.377
This creates a subliminal power dynamic.

01:08:55.715 --> 01:08:57.330
Look, Gomez, don't...

01:08:58.343 --> 01:09:01.676
You know as well as I do
you raped and killed her.

01:09:01.970 --> 01:09:03.131
Liliana?

01:09:03.221 --> 01:09:04.428
Are you serious?

01:09:04.515 --> 01:09:07.381
There's a constant shifting of the axis.

01:09:07.477 --> 01:09:12.140
It's a way of conducting the scene

01:09:14.817 --> 01:09:16.432
that makes us feel uncomfortable.

01:09:16.527 --> 01:09:19.894
It makes us feel uncertain.

01:09:19.988 --> 01:09:21.479
It causes stress.

01:09:21.698 --> 01:09:24.782
I left because I couldn't afford it.

01:09:24.952 --> 01:09:28.490
- And your job?
- I found one that paid better.

01:09:29.040 --> 01:09:30.951
What's that got to do with Liliana?

01:09:31.376 --> 01:09:32.616
I've known her my whole life...

01:09:32.710 --> 01:09:34.746
She's a friend from my childhood.

01:09:47.517 --> 01:09:49.678
The poorly composed character.

01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:52.305
They can't find sandoval.

01:09:53.814 --> 01:09:55.680
- What?
- They can't find sandoval.

01:09:55.942 --> 01:09:59.776
All the space we saw in the right side
of the frame earlier with esposito,

01:09:59.862 --> 01:10:03.855
which made for a poorly composed frame
that was missing something,

01:10:03.950 --> 01:10:06.316
is now filled in by Irene's presence.

01:10:09.997 --> 01:10:12.613
And suddenly,
we can see that there's a team.

01:10:12.709 --> 01:10:16.418
The frame was poorly composed,
now it's well-composed.

01:10:16.504 --> 01:10:19.712
The frame was missing something,
now it's complete.

01:10:28.808 --> 01:10:32.392
Once again, we hide the rest of the face
to focus on the eyes.

01:10:33.479 --> 01:10:34.719
Look, Gomez.

01:10:36.357 --> 01:10:38.393
The judge handling your case...

01:10:38.484 --> 01:10:39.974
It's her attitude more than anything.

01:10:40.069 --> 01:10:42.856
The way she averts her eyes

01:10:43.906 --> 01:10:45.146
and looks at esposito.

01:10:46.743 --> 01:10:51.737
This is really the turning point
for Irene's character.

01:10:51.831 --> 01:10:54.948
Here, Irene starts to get a sense
of the real world.

01:10:55.042 --> 01:10:57.829
Not the world of books

01:10:57.920 --> 01:11:00.627
or guidelines or laws,

01:11:00.715 --> 01:11:04.128
but rather the world of the true
professional, the true artist,

01:11:04.218 --> 01:11:08.211
the world of sensations,
feelings, intuition.

01:11:08.931 --> 01:11:11.263
She doesn't know how she knows either.

01:11:11.934 --> 01:11:13.424
Let me see the autopsy.

01:11:14.937 --> 01:11:16.268
Hiding.

01:11:16.481 --> 01:11:18.187
The coloto girl...

01:11:18.775 --> 01:11:21.141
Here she is. 5 feet 6...

01:11:21.986 --> 01:11:23.442
128 pounds.

01:11:23.529 --> 01:11:25.269
Look what he did to her.

01:11:28.242 --> 01:11:32.451
We can say that Irene the judge
is born in this scene.

01:11:37.210 --> 01:11:39.246
Besides, she was a beautiful woman.

01:11:41.756 --> 01:11:46.090
In mythology, the moment in the story

01:11:46.636 --> 01:11:50.049
where the character becomes aware
of his destiny is very important.

01:11:52.642 --> 01:11:54.428
This is Irene's moment.

01:11:56.187 --> 01:11:57.973
You think so?

01:11:58.940 --> 01:12:00.396
I mean...

01:12:02.151 --> 01:12:04.358
The door wasn't forced.

01:12:05.863 --> 01:12:08.821
That means she knew her assailant.

01:12:09.659 --> 01:12:10.899
Yes.

01:12:11.744 --> 01:12:14.986
But there's no way such a woman
would ever remember this twinkie.

01:12:16.165 --> 01:12:17.655
Unless she was a hooker.

01:12:18.501 --> 01:12:20.583
Some guys you only do for money.

01:12:21.754 --> 01:12:22.869
Who is she?

01:12:22.964 --> 01:12:24.500
Keep your fucking mouth shut.

01:12:28.177 --> 01:12:30.884
No, she was a decent girl,
I assure you.

01:12:32.932 --> 01:12:35.048
I agree with the kid about that.

01:12:35.268 --> 01:12:37.509
She was two-timing that bank clerk
for sure.

01:12:37.603 --> 01:12:42.723
I'll bet his horns were so big
he needed a convertible.

01:12:43.693 --> 01:12:45.229
What are you laughing at,
retard?

01:12:46.445 --> 01:12:49.357
That guy who gave testimony
last time.

01:12:49.448 --> 01:12:51.985
- Sandoval?
- Right. I bet it was him.

01:12:52.076 --> 01:12:55.284
He was her lover.
Tall, good-looking, broad shoulders.

01:12:55.371 --> 01:12:59.410
When you do a scene repeatedly all day,
non-stop,

01:12:59.500 --> 01:13:02.367
with actors of this caliber,

01:13:02.461 --> 01:13:07.831
new things keep cropping up,

01:13:07.925 --> 01:13:12.089
small variations that give the scene

01:13:12.179 --> 01:13:15.012
an unpredictable quality.

01:13:16.058 --> 01:13:19.095
Sometimes you get unexpected reactions,

01:13:19.186 --> 01:13:22.929
unexpected ways of saying certain lines.

01:13:23.024 --> 01:13:27.233
In an effort to keep it fresh, which is
actually intuitive, it's not an effort,

01:13:31.032 --> 01:13:34.490
lots of little gems come up

01:13:34.577 --> 01:13:37.910
that the watchful eye,
or the watchful editor, has to catch

01:13:37.997 --> 01:13:40.283
so they don't end up
on the cutting room floor.

01:13:55.640 --> 01:13:57.756
Regaining composure a little.

01:14:00.102 --> 01:14:01.638
You people are crazy.

01:14:01.729 --> 01:14:06.723
Bringing things back together
when Gomez was about to lose his calm,

01:14:07.985 --> 01:14:11.148
you regain strength, rally the troops.

01:14:12.031 --> 01:14:15.273
"The damage to the right parietal bone...

01:14:15.368 --> 01:14:19.611
Demonstrates the assailant had
extraordinary upper body strength."

01:14:21.791 --> 01:14:22.826
Look.

01:14:22.917 --> 01:14:25.124
Two noodles.

01:14:28.464 --> 01:14:31.501
"Likewise, due to the depth
of her vaginal injuries...

01:14:31.592 --> 01:14:36.382
We may deduce that the assailant
was very well-endowed."

01:14:36.973 --> 01:14:40.557
Obviously they're not talking about
this microbe. He must have a peanut.

01:14:57.910 --> 01:14:59.992
There it is, bitch.

01:15:00.079 --> 01:15:04.618
A lot of people asked
why we showed Gomez's penis,

01:15:04.709 --> 01:15:06.916
saying it wasn't necessary.

01:15:07.003 --> 01:15:10.666
That's true. From a narrative perspective,
it wasn't necessary.

01:15:10.756 --> 01:15:14.044
To me, it seemed totally prudish,

01:15:14.218 --> 01:15:16.755
from a moral perspective, not to show it.

01:15:16.846 --> 01:15:21.886
If he had taken out a pen or a revolver,
we obviously would've shown it.

01:15:21.976 --> 01:15:26.845
But also, from the viewer's perspective,
feeling what she felt...

01:15:26.939 --> 01:15:30.932
For me,
the people who were shocked by that shot,

01:15:31.027 --> 01:15:34.770
proved, simply by being shocked,

01:15:34.864 --> 01:15:37.071
the need to put it in there.

01:15:37.575 --> 01:15:40.066
They felt what Irene felt at that moment.

01:15:40.202 --> 01:15:41.817
Let go of me!

01:15:41.996 --> 01:15:44.362
Touch her and I'll kill you.
I'll kill you!

01:15:51.797 --> 01:15:52.912
Let go of me!

01:16:08.481 --> 01:16:14.568
Again, this is a shot with two small men
in a huge swarm of people.

01:16:15.738 --> 01:16:19.572
These days, of course, retiro station
is full of kiosks with neon lights,

01:16:19.658 --> 01:16:21.774
and a lot of effects went into this shot.

01:16:33.089 --> 01:16:37.583
The case appears to be closed.
The plot reaches a comfortable point

01:16:39.845 --> 01:16:41.585
and it has to move forward.

01:16:42.765 --> 01:16:47.350
We have to create new doubts,
new questions, new expectations.

01:16:48.479 --> 01:16:50.390
At this point,

01:16:50.481 --> 01:16:53.518
we're not really sure
what this scene is about.

01:16:53.609 --> 01:16:58.069
We do know that there are ghosts
in his head looking for answers.

01:16:58.823 --> 01:17:01.860
- Hello?
- Hi, it's me. Did I wake you?

01:17:02.409 --> 01:17:04.115
No, I was...

01:17:04.453 --> 01:17:07.286
Working a bit.
Why are you up so late?

01:17:08.124 --> 01:17:09.739
I was thinking...

01:17:09.834 --> 01:17:12.951
- You don't say.
- Yeah, silly.

01:17:13.295 --> 01:17:14.831
No, about the novel.

01:17:14.922 --> 01:17:17.288
I want to read it when it's finished.

01:17:17.925 --> 01:17:22.464
We see that, despite
trying to cut herself off

01:17:22.555 --> 01:17:26.548
from esposito in the present,

01:17:26.642 --> 01:17:29.634
Irene can't stop thinking about him,

01:17:29.728 --> 01:17:33.471
and she tells him she'd like to
read his book when he's finished.

01:17:33.566 --> 01:17:36.182
Also, she says she's drinking tea
because she can't sleep.

01:17:36.277 --> 01:17:39.360
We know that she can't sleep
because she's thinking about him.

01:17:39.446 --> 01:17:42.734
We transition to this scene

01:17:42.825 --> 01:17:45.066
and right away,
we know what Irene is thinking about

01:17:45.161 --> 01:17:48.324
as she drinks her tea 25 years earlier.

01:17:51.125 --> 01:17:53.537
Municipalities and public facilities...

01:17:53.627 --> 01:17:56.118
Located across the country.

01:17:56.755 --> 01:18:01.089
She personally delivered clothing,
school supplies and candy...

01:18:01.177 --> 01:18:02.417
Lo be distributed...

01:18:02.511 --> 01:18:05.628
In lobos, a village
in the province of Buenos Aires.

01:18:06.265 --> 01:18:09.382
Also present at the ceremony were...

01:18:22.531 --> 01:18:23.531
Hello?

01:18:23.824 --> 01:18:26.156
We thought the story was over,

01:18:28.287 --> 01:18:29.287
butitisn't.

01:18:29.371 --> 01:18:32.329
Not only did it continue, it got worse.

01:18:34.335 --> 01:18:35.541
What?

01:18:37.463 --> 01:18:39.044
What?

01:18:46.138 --> 01:18:48.675
And also, thanks to them,
we can achieve..

01:18:48.766 --> 01:18:52.054
Many things, because people
can't do it all on their own.

01:18:54.230 --> 01:18:58.269
I won't go into
why we chose that time in history

01:18:58.359 --> 01:19:00.099
and why we put Gomez behind isabelita.

01:19:00.194 --> 01:19:05.655
It would just be nice if the doubts,
the questions

01:19:05.741 --> 01:19:09.279
and the debate that this choice provoked

01:19:10.079 --> 01:19:13.617
inspired people who weren't alive then

01:19:13.707 --> 01:19:16.540
to open a history book and learn about it.

01:19:17.378 --> 01:19:20.415
These two, raising their hands.
I want you to get them.

01:19:21.131 --> 01:19:23.122
What are you doing here?
Are you crazy?

01:19:23.217 --> 01:19:24.753
No, you are.

01:19:25.469 --> 01:19:27.755
- Ma'am.
- We need to talk to you.

01:19:28.264 --> 01:19:30.380
Fellas, would you mind?

01:19:35.354 --> 01:19:38.096
If you'd called first,
I'd have had coffee ready.

01:19:39.692 --> 01:19:41.398
Isidoro Gomez. Rape and murder...

01:19:41.485 --> 01:19:44.943
Again, the mixture of daylight outside
and the red inside the office

01:19:45.030 --> 01:19:46.861
is very evident here.

01:19:47.491 --> 01:19:48.526
We checked...

01:19:48.617 --> 01:19:50.448
And here we are.
Anything to say?

01:19:50.619 --> 01:19:52.419
Yeah, sure. That you two
need to get out more.

01:19:52.454 --> 01:19:55.537
Red elements in Irene's shirt.

01:19:55.624 --> 01:19:57.239
This is the real world.

01:19:57.668 --> 01:20:00.705
While you two are shooting birds,
we're in here...

01:20:00.796 --> 01:20:03.128
Fighting in the middle of the jungle.

01:20:04.508 --> 01:20:05.793
Gomez, Gomez, Gomez...

01:20:05.884 --> 01:20:10.218
A shiny blue in Romano's suit.

01:20:11.515 --> 01:20:15.554
Positive, brighter.
The new Argentina he sees.

01:20:15.894 --> 01:20:17.259
What's the problem?

01:20:18.814 --> 01:20:22.227
Do you realize what you're saying?
He confessed. He's a convicted...

01:20:22.318 --> 01:20:23.318
Murderer.

01:20:23.402 --> 01:20:26.018
Perhaps, but he's also
intelligent...

01:20:26.113 --> 01:20:29.230
There was an earlier scene in the script,
which we actually filmed,

01:20:29.325 --> 01:20:33.409
where Romano and esposito
see each other at the courts

01:20:33.495 --> 01:20:37.329
and Romano says, "look,
I'm at the ministry of social welfare now.

01:20:37.416 --> 01:20:39.702
"Stop by for a coffee sometime."

01:20:39.793 --> 01:20:44.162
We took it out because it gave us
an idea of what was to come

01:20:44.256 --> 01:20:50.343
and because we felt it was
too explanatory for Argentineans.

01:20:52.639 --> 01:20:56.473
When dealing with history,
you're constantly debating

01:20:56.560 --> 01:21:01.520
to what degree something is
didactic or dramatic.

01:21:02.066 --> 01:21:04.603
We decided that the scene was unnecessary

01:21:04.693 --> 01:21:07.605
from a dramatic standpoint.
It was purely didactic.

01:21:07.696 --> 01:21:11.405
So we ran the risk
that it wouldn't be understood

01:21:11.492 --> 01:21:13.699
and we took that scene out.

01:21:13.786 --> 01:21:17.278
Viewers who don't know what happened
at the ministry of social welfare

01:21:17.373 --> 01:21:21.082
or what these characters are talking about
do understand the important part,

01:21:21.168 --> 01:21:26.788
that a paragovernmental group
crushed the armed guerrilla movement,

01:21:26.882 --> 01:21:29.589
which is where state repression began,

01:21:29.676 --> 01:21:32.509
and that it was a group
who fed on people like that.

01:21:33.931 --> 01:21:36.547
Those who believe otherwise

01:21:36.642 --> 01:21:40.009
can take the debate
to the historical and political arenas,

01:21:40.104 --> 01:21:42.060
not the cinematographic one.

01:21:42.231 --> 01:21:44.062
Let her go back to her world.

01:21:45.067 --> 01:21:47.149
But if you have a problem with me...

01:21:47.736 --> 01:21:50.068
Come alone and we'll settle it.

01:21:55.577 --> 01:21:56.817
Come on, Irene.

01:21:56.912 --> 01:21:58.072
There are

01:22:00.249 --> 01:22:04.583
ample sources to support this version.

01:22:06.422 --> 01:22:08.083
Neither of you
can do a thing about it.

01:22:22.187 --> 01:22:25.099
And the descent into hell continues.

01:22:25.190 --> 01:22:29.103
The humiliation appears complete,
but we still have a long way to go.

01:22:46.962 --> 01:22:49.749
This is another scene that,

01:22:51.091 --> 01:22:56.211
had we done it with cuts,
would've lost all its power.

01:22:57.806 --> 01:22:59.637
Or at least some of its power.

01:23:01.310 --> 01:23:05.053
The elevator sound
that José Luis Diaz found

01:23:06.648 --> 01:23:11.392
adds a sort of ghostly
element to the scene,

01:23:11.487 --> 01:23:15.400
making any other type
of musical effect unnecessary.

01:23:15.491 --> 01:23:19.655
In this case,
it doesn't get gloomier than reality.

01:23:33.675 --> 01:23:34.881
You said life.

01:23:36.637 --> 01:23:37.843
Yes...

01:23:38.013 --> 01:23:39.423
Morales tried.

01:23:39.515 --> 01:23:43.758
And he collaborated with the authorities
in everything he did,

01:23:43.852 --> 01:23:45.888
giving them all the information he had.

01:23:47.814 --> 01:23:49.350
In this scene,

01:23:52.027 --> 01:23:54.860
he decides that he's on his own.

01:23:57.533 --> 01:23:59.273
If I could, what for?

01:23:59.868 --> 01:24:02.610
What would I do?
What would four bullets get me?

01:24:03.455 --> 01:24:04.820
A lifetime in jail.

01:24:05.541 --> 01:24:09.329
Gomez goes free without ever serving
and I spend 50 years...

01:24:09.419 --> 01:24:12.707
Stuck in a cell, envying him.

01:24:14.341 --> 01:24:15.341
No.

01:24:16.885 --> 01:24:20.548
No, life in prison
would have been fair.

01:24:24.393 --> 01:24:27.385
I wish I could help,
but I honestly don't know how.

01:24:31.733 --> 01:24:33.018
Who knows?

01:24:34.194 --> 01:24:35.559
Some other time...

01:24:41.326 --> 01:24:42.441
Anyway.

01:24:43.287 --> 01:24:44.902
- I'll get it.
- No, please.

01:24:44.997 --> 01:24:46.453
It's just a coffee.

01:24:51.086 --> 01:24:53.623
I'm very grateful for everything
you've done for me.

01:24:54.464 --> 01:24:56.671
I wouldn't have made it this far
without you.

01:24:59.261 --> 01:25:00.592
I owe you one.

01:25:03.098 --> 01:25:05.384
Morales already knows his future here.

01:25:12.274 --> 01:25:17.610
I think the major dilemmas,
the major dramatic conflicts,

01:25:17.696 --> 01:25:23.111
can be boiled down to two things,
threats to dignity and threats to life.

01:25:23.201 --> 01:25:27.820
Esposito's dignity
has been destroyed, tarnished.

01:25:27.914 --> 01:25:31.372
He has been humiliated
in the eyes of the law,

01:25:31.460 --> 01:25:33.451
in the eyes of the woman he loves,

01:25:35.339 --> 01:25:36.795
and in his own eyes.

01:25:39.468 --> 01:25:41.925
But his life isn't in danger yet.

01:25:43.263 --> 01:25:44.298
No, you aren't.

01:25:44.389 --> 01:25:47.131
You'd have to be there, but you're here.

01:25:51.063 --> 01:25:52.303
Benjamin.

01:25:55.776 --> 01:25:56.856
Yes?

01:25:59.529 --> 01:26:01.815
How long before you talk to me again?

01:26:02.366 --> 01:26:03.981
I talk to you every day.

01:26:06.870 --> 01:26:08.485
I'm not untouchable.

01:26:09.665 --> 01:26:10.745
Or from another world.

01:26:10.832 --> 01:26:14.495
But the case,
although it ended badly, is over.

01:26:17.214 --> 01:26:18.875
And their lives go on.

01:26:18.965 --> 01:26:24.050
So we decided, dramatically,

01:26:25.222 --> 01:26:29.181
to pull a sort of sleight of hand

01:26:29.851 --> 01:26:33.890
and make viewers believe we were moving
in the direction of the love story,

01:26:35.982 --> 01:26:39.520
and even in the direction
of romantic comedy.

01:26:41.321 --> 01:26:44.063
Irene wants to meet up with him,

01:26:45.826 --> 01:26:47.407
and clearly

01:26:49.329 --> 01:26:52.366
makes a date.

01:26:52.457 --> 01:26:53.559
About my life, my fiance...

01:26:53.583 --> 01:26:55.949
My marriage and anything else
related to the case.

01:27:00.048 --> 01:27:01.959
We can meet for coffee after work.

01:27:02.843 --> 01:27:03.958
Time?

01:27:07.723 --> 01:27:09.213
8:30. Place?

01:27:09.349 --> 01:27:11.340
- The immortals.
- The Richmond.

01:27:11.601 --> 01:27:15.219
We're back to the energy curve,
the tonal curve.

01:27:15.313 --> 01:27:21.559
We're coming off a very dramatic moment
that caused a lot of anguish

01:27:21.695 --> 01:27:23.651
and we're stepping into the light.

01:27:23.739 --> 01:27:26.196
We'll play in a major scale again,

01:27:26.283 --> 01:27:28.695
to put it in musical terms.

01:27:30.579 --> 01:27:32.499
It seems like this is the
direction it'll go in.

01:27:32.539 --> 01:27:35.997
Even this minor conflict here which,

01:27:36.501 --> 01:27:39.163
in a slightly somber way,

01:27:39.254 --> 01:27:43.588
shows us the conflict at that time
between a fascist...

01:27:43.675 --> 01:27:46.087
We can deduce
what the notary's position is.

01:27:46.178 --> 01:27:48.760
We can deduce what sandoval's position is.

01:27:49.890 --> 01:27:54.179
But it brings us to a witty remark,
something almost funny.

01:27:54.311 --> 01:27:57.269
I repeat, we're going to
play in a major scale.

01:28:00.066 --> 01:28:02.899
Even more so in the next scene.

01:28:02.986 --> 01:28:06.854
Arrest the motherfuckers!
Show them some fucking justice!

01:28:07.449 --> 01:28:09.440
- Fuck you!
- My jacket! My jacket!

01:28:09.534 --> 01:28:10.694
You're wearing it.

01:28:16.082 --> 01:28:18.198
It was important to see the bar
from the front,

01:28:18.293 --> 01:28:23.083
because later we'll see morales
watching the building from there.

01:28:24.800 --> 01:28:27.257
And this scene borders on the ridiculous.

01:28:27.344 --> 01:28:32.338
I must admit, I've never laughed as hard
as I did when we rehearsed this scene.

01:28:32.432 --> 01:28:36.516
At times like that, you feel privileged

01:28:36.603 --> 01:28:39.936
to work with two such actors.

01:28:40.774 --> 01:28:42.480
She's never going to answer.

01:28:42.859 --> 01:28:43.894
Why?

01:28:43.985 --> 01:28:45.441
Because the phone doesn't work.

01:28:45.529 --> 01:28:47.190
What do you mean? Put that down.

01:28:48.031 --> 01:28:49.217
I told you a thousand times...

01:28:49.241 --> 01:28:51.573
The timing of sandoval's responses...

01:28:53.328 --> 01:28:54.864
And you didn't help me.

01:28:55.580 --> 01:28:57.161
That was six months ago.

01:28:58.124 --> 01:29:00.365
The phone hasn't worked for a year.

01:29:00.460 --> 01:29:04.373
The way he moves, deliberately, slowly...

01:29:04.589 --> 01:29:06.625
Put that down.
Stop touching stuff.

01:29:07.717 --> 01:29:09.048
If you ever...

01:29:09.135 --> 01:29:14.971
The timing in this scene
is practically anti-comedic.

01:29:15.058 --> 01:29:16.298
I wanted to sue them.

01:29:18.228 --> 01:29:19.343
Look at me.

01:29:19.980 --> 01:29:22.221
- You have a date?
- No, no.

01:29:22.649 --> 01:29:25.061
You have a date.
And I'm leaving.

01:29:25.151 --> 01:29:28.314
The last thing I need
is you calling me a party pooper.

01:29:29.406 --> 01:29:31.818
Too much furniture in here.

01:29:31.908 --> 01:29:34.775
- Sit here.
- I always run into shit.

01:29:34.870 --> 01:29:37.737
Have a seat until you feel better.

01:29:37.831 --> 01:29:39.662
Have a seat.

01:29:39.749 --> 01:29:45.494
In short, all this leads viewers to believe
that the story will go like this,

01:29:45.589 --> 01:29:51.004
"now he'll hook up with Irene, sandoval will
be around, they'll have an affair, etc."

01:29:51.177 --> 01:29:54.044
I'll try to convince your wife
not to kill you.

01:29:55.140 --> 01:29:56.550
Call her on the phone.

01:29:56.641 --> 01:30:01.135
This steers us toward Harmony,
as I said, between Harmony and change.

01:30:03.064 --> 01:30:05.430
Mine doesn't work, Benjamin.

01:30:05.525 --> 01:30:06.856
Use yours.

01:30:11.406 --> 01:30:15.069
Just stay here. Don't touch anything,
don't do anything.

01:30:15.535 --> 01:30:17.196
I'll be right back.

01:30:18.580 --> 01:30:20.411
Turn off the light. Yes.

01:30:22.542 --> 01:30:25.158
We'll catch that son of a bitch.

01:30:25.253 --> 01:30:27.335
We'll catch him.

01:30:31.092 --> 01:30:35.426
- We were working all day.
- Save it, some other time.

01:30:35.722 --> 01:30:39.761
Again, if we were describing
a musical composition,

01:30:39.851 --> 01:30:43.218
we'd be talking about
a modulatory bridge here

01:30:44.981 --> 01:30:49.145
because there will be
a sudden change in tone.

01:30:49.235 --> 01:30:52.193
Actually, not a sudden change in tone,

01:30:52.280 --> 01:30:55.192
but rather a powerful change in tone,

01:30:55.283 --> 01:30:58.525
an important change in scale.

01:30:58.620 --> 01:31:01.953
We're gradually moving
from one scale to the other.

01:31:08.296 --> 01:31:09.296
Pablo?

01:31:09.714 --> 01:31:11.875
- What is it?
- I don't know. Pablo?

01:31:11.967 --> 01:31:14.379
- Don't scare me.
- Wait there.

01:31:15.553 --> 01:31:16.633
Pablo...

01:31:20.392 --> 01:31:23.429
- No!
- What is it? What happened?

01:31:26.481 --> 01:31:29.314
I'd like to start talking about the music.

01:31:31.695 --> 01:31:35.153
The music we're hearing now
isn't bombastic,

01:31:35.240 --> 01:31:39.734
it isn't dramatic, but it is tragic.

01:31:39.828 --> 01:31:42.285
The music has a hint of requiem,

01:31:42.372 --> 01:31:45.284
but it's almost angelic.

01:31:45.375 --> 01:31:50.119
This music diminishes,
acting as a counterpoint

01:31:51.464 --> 01:31:53.625
to this scene's dramatic surge.

01:31:53.967 --> 01:31:57.175
- He's gonna go after you.
- No, my father knows who to talk to.

01:31:57.429 --> 01:32:02.514
That was a brief introduction
to the subject of music.

01:32:02.600 --> 01:32:05.888
We've reached the last scene
of the second act.

01:32:05.979 --> 01:32:10.598
His dignity is clearly destroyed,
his life threatened.

01:32:10.692 --> 01:32:14.526
Everything is a lot worse
than when it started,

01:32:14.612 --> 01:32:16.523
with no solution in sight.

01:32:19.534 --> 01:32:22.116
This was the hardest scene to do
in the entire movie.

01:32:22.203 --> 01:32:23.318
Finding the right tone.

01:32:23.413 --> 01:32:26.120
Although esposito is remembering this,

01:32:26.207 --> 01:32:30.200
and we could therefore
have been overly melodramatic,

01:32:30.295 --> 01:32:33.913
we needed this scene to work

01:32:34.007 --> 01:32:36.669
with our 21st century sensibility.

01:32:37.552 --> 01:32:42.216
We begin with lots of subliminal themes,

01:32:42.307 --> 01:32:48.018
for example, we can see that all the actors
are wearing colors,

01:32:48.104 --> 01:32:50.561
while these two
are wearing black and white.

01:32:50.648 --> 01:32:54.140
It has a subliminal hint of the '40s,

01:32:55.528 --> 01:33:00.739
two people wrapped up
in one of those old romantic movies

01:33:00.825 --> 01:33:03.737
in a more modern world.

01:33:09.501 --> 01:33:12.993
Both federico jusid and Emilio kauderer
can attest to the fact

01:33:13.088 --> 01:33:17.798
that we never worked so hard
to find the right tone for the music.

01:33:17.884 --> 01:33:22.093
In the first version,
we went with melodrama, of course.

01:33:22.180 --> 01:33:26.890
It was very similar
to Lara's theme from Dr. Zhivago

01:33:27.685 --> 01:33:32.099
and transformed the scene
into something very sappy.

01:33:32.190 --> 01:33:33.851
It didn't work.

01:33:35.276 --> 01:33:41.693
The editing also went along with the music,
and that didn't work either.

01:33:41.783 --> 01:33:45.367
We had a very hard time
finding the right balance in the editing

01:33:45.453 --> 01:33:48.035
and in the music as well.

01:33:48.123 --> 01:33:52.457
In subsequent versions of the music,
I think there were more than 15,

01:33:52.544 --> 01:33:55.661
we always brought it down,
always less and less.

01:33:55.755 --> 01:33:57.666
First we took out instruments.

01:33:57.757 --> 01:34:00.043
Then we took out crescendos.

01:34:01.219 --> 01:34:05.553
The shot we're seeing now was almost
removed from the movie altogether

01:34:05.640 --> 01:34:11.431
because it always seemed too dramatic,
too melodramatic.

01:34:11.521 --> 01:34:15.105
I loved it, and we finally
found a place for it.

01:34:15.191 --> 01:34:20.356
It took several revisions, several edits,

01:34:20.446 --> 01:34:23.563
before we found the right balance

01:34:23.658 --> 01:34:27.492
between realism, melodrama and romance.

01:34:31.332 --> 01:34:34.074
This isn't a formula, of course,

01:34:34.169 --> 01:34:38.583
and the way we found this balance

01:34:38.673 --> 01:34:43.713
was by simply trying different things.
Trial and error the entire time.

01:34:43.803 --> 01:34:47.421
That's how we did it.

01:34:47.515 --> 01:34:49.722
End of the second act. The curtain falls.

01:34:54.731 --> 01:34:56.562
"With you, the actors,"

01:34:57.275 --> 01:34:59.982
as they used to say in an old TV show.

01:35:07.243 --> 01:35:08.723
We're playing with memory here again.

01:35:08.786 --> 01:35:14.907
We'll never know if that train scene
happened the way we saw it

01:35:15.501 --> 01:35:19.961
or if esposito is
remembering it differently.

01:35:21.799 --> 01:35:23.414
Your house is exactly
as I imagined it.

01:35:23.509 --> 01:35:25.875
How did you imagine it?

01:35:26.512 --> 01:35:29.379
Exactly like this.
Exactly like I imagined it.

01:35:29.515 --> 01:35:30.675
Sure...

01:35:31.059 --> 01:35:34.722
We start with a major key again.

01:35:36.648 --> 01:35:40.232
When I say major key and minor key,
I'm referring to

01:35:42.528 --> 01:35:46.396
a musical explanation
of the energy in the movie.

01:35:46.491 --> 01:35:51.281
In a major key, all the notes seem to fall
where they're supposed to.

01:35:51.371 --> 01:35:52.907
In a minor key,

01:35:54.165 --> 01:35:59.330
there are always one or two notes
that fall in an odd place.

01:35:59.420 --> 01:36:04.335
They give us a strange feeling.
There's stress in the music.

01:36:06.886 --> 01:36:10.754
So here we start in a major key
and quickly move to a minor key.

01:36:11.432 --> 01:36:13.548
Or even believable.

01:36:13.643 --> 01:36:15.884
Yes. No. What?
It isn't believable?

01:36:16.896 --> 01:36:21.435
Irene's character uses a system of attack

01:36:22.443 --> 01:36:24.775
common to courtroom dramas...

01:36:24.862 --> 01:36:28.104
From a direction standpoint even...

01:36:29.117 --> 01:36:34.703
The lawyer who, using the socratic method,
with yes or no questions,

01:36:34.789 --> 01:36:38.202
leads the witness into a trap.

01:36:38.293 --> 01:36:42.878
She even moves toward him gradually
until he has no way out.

01:36:42.964 --> 01:36:45.125
Love she'd never had
the courage to confess...

01:36:45.258 --> 01:36:47.715
That's what happened. Isn't it?

01:36:52.098 --> 01:36:53.338
If that's what happened...

01:36:56.686 --> 01:36:58.051
Why didn't you take me with you?

01:36:58.396 --> 01:37:01.934
Again, we see Irene the judge,
Irene from the interrogation,

01:37:03.651 --> 01:37:05.357
in a romantic scene.

01:37:12.452 --> 01:37:13.567
Dimwit.

01:37:32.472 --> 01:37:34.884
How does the case proceed?

01:37:36.684 --> 01:37:41.053
There are no longer any secrets between
them, only the impossibility of closeness.

01:37:42.523 --> 01:37:45.606
The only thing left to tear down

01:37:45.693 --> 01:37:47.729
is that wall.

01:37:49.906 --> 01:37:55.117
Or that he came back married
to a rich little jujuyan Princess.

01:37:55.203 --> 01:37:56.864
She was wonderful.

01:37:57.538 --> 01:37:59.779
It wasn't her fault
I could never love her.

01:38:04.712 --> 01:38:06.828
It's a lousy ending.

01:38:06.923 --> 01:38:08.333
It's crap.

01:38:09.967 --> 01:38:11.252
You see?

01:38:11.386 --> 01:38:15.846
I don't want to miss another chance.
How is it possible?

01:38:15.932 --> 01:38:17.388
How can I do nothing about it?

01:38:17.475 --> 01:38:18.840
I've been asking myself...

01:38:18.935 --> 01:38:22.644
For 25 years and I've only been able
to come up with one answer.

01:38:22.730 --> 01:38:26.314
"Forget it, it was another lifetime.
It's over, don't ask."

01:38:26.401 --> 01:38:29.234
It wasn't another lifetime.
It was this one.

01:38:30.613 --> 01:38:32.069
It is this one.

01:38:32.615 --> 01:38:34.230
Now I want to understand.

01:38:34.325 --> 01:38:36.486
How can someone live an empty life?

01:38:36.577 --> 01:38:40.069
How do you live a life
full of nothing?

01:38:40.873 --> 01:38:42.283
How do you do it?

01:38:42.959 --> 01:38:45.826
A new part of the search starts here,

01:38:45.920 --> 01:38:49.287
a search they embark on together.

01:38:51.259 --> 01:38:55.252
Just like sandoval showed the way earlier,

01:38:56.931 --> 01:39:00.298
and this time Irene does.

01:39:01.269 --> 01:39:03.385
You see? That's his mother.

01:39:03.938 --> 01:39:07.977
Sir, we are required by law
to notify a change of address.

01:39:08.067 --> 01:39:11.525
It's not something we do because
we feel like it. Understand?

01:39:11.612 --> 01:39:13.398
- I do now.
- Morales, Ricardo.

01:39:13.489 --> 01:39:16.526
There's one, two... four, ma'am.

01:39:16.617 --> 01:39:18.448
Let's search by l.D. Number.

01:39:18.536 --> 01:39:21.118
- What's your first number?
- Three, what's yours?

01:39:22.081 --> 01:39:24.948
What do you care?
“What? Can'tl...?

01:39:25.042 --> 01:39:29.752
Here's a five and a six.
Morales, Ricardo Augustin.

01:39:30.465 --> 01:39:32.751
He changed addresses in 1975.

01:39:33.718 --> 01:39:35.504
Write this down, pata-pata.

01:39:57.074 --> 01:40:00.487
There was a new search for color
in this scene as well,

01:40:00.578 --> 01:40:06.744
a color that doesn't quite fit
in the present or the past.

01:40:07.210 --> 01:40:11.249
Although we still have color desaturation,

01:40:11.339 --> 01:40:15.924
there's a brown, earthy element
and an element of scorching sun

01:40:16.010 --> 01:40:17.500
that is much more prevalent.

01:40:17.595 --> 01:40:21.929
This will be even more apparent
when we see

01:40:22.016 --> 01:40:24.098
esposito leaving the morales situation.

01:40:28.022 --> 01:40:31.685
This is where we start
to insert little clues

01:40:33.236 --> 01:40:37.570
that don't attract attention in themselves,

01:40:37.657 --> 01:40:41.946
but make you feel
like something isn't quite right,

01:40:42.036 --> 01:40:44.618
including the film narrative.

01:40:44.705 --> 01:40:46.946
I'll explain when we get to them.

01:40:48.709 --> 01:40:50.916
A totally solitary place.

01:40:53.089 --> 01:40:56.877
There are no dogs,
which is strange for a farm.

01:40:57.802 --> 01:41:02.045
There are no dogs, although they could alert
someone to the presence of other people.

01:41:05.142 --> 01:41:08.509
The man we see in the distance
is carrying a tray of things,

01:41:08.604 --> 01:41:10.720
which could be strange, or not.

01:41:14.068 --> 01:41:15.808
- Quite a surprise.
- I know...

01:41:15.903 --> 01:41:19.066
We don't draw any attention
to the tray, of course.

01:41:20.741 --> 01:41:25.701
Morales is uncomfortable.
There's a constant tension

01:41:26.455 --> 01:41:31.540
between what he feels,
which is extreme danger,

01:41:31.627 --> 01:41:37.088
and the way he thinks he should appear,
which is like a man with no worries.

01:41:38.092 --> 01:41:42.586
What problem could cause this man
from that time to pay him a visit?

01:41:45.266 --> 01:41:48.133
What I was saying
about film narrative is coming up.

01:41:48.227 --> 01:41:50.343
There is no reason

01:41:51.647 --> 01:41:54.810
for the cut that's coming up here.

01:41:56.444 --> 01:41:58.605
Him drawing that curtain.

01:41:58.696 --> 01:42:00.937
No reason whatsoever.

01:42:03.784 --> 01:42:06.776
As viewers, we sense
that something strange just happened,

01:42:06.871 --> 01:42:10.864
but we can't understand what.

01:42:10.958 --> 01:42:14.041
It's just a hunch that
there was something odd

01:42:14.128 --> 01:42:16.289
about that cut, and then it passes.

01:42:17.173 --> 01:42:19.289
This will all come back, of course.

01:42:20.301 --> 01:42:23.213
There's always a branch nobody wants,
so here I am...

01:42:23.387 --> 01:42:25.127
With a promotion and everything.

01:42:25.473 --> 01:42:27.134
It seems incredible,

01:42:27.224 --> 01:42:31.092
but esposito hasn't even seen a picture
of Liliana coloto in 25 years.

01:42:32.271 --> 01:42:35.354
He's seeing her for the first time
after 25 years.

01:42:35.816 --> 01:42:37.147
Remember Liliana?

01:42:39.695 --> 01:42:41.651
He comes face to face with his memory.

01:42:44.742 --> 01:42:49.827
In the shot of the photo, we saw
some medical books that we'll come back to.

01:42:50.873 --> 01:42:52.613
Still here.

01:42:53.584 --> 01:42:55.415
No, I mean single...

01:42:55.503 --> 01:42:57.664
- Married...
- No.

01:42:57.838 --> 01:42:59.078
No, really.

01:42:59.173 --> 01:43:01.880
I think I just... at that point...

01:43:01.967 --> 01:43:05.676
Morales is obviously trying to be
as good-natured as possible.

01:43:05.763 --> 01:43:08.755
He has no reason to be anything but.

01:43:08.849 --> 01:43:14.890
Or at least esposito shouldn't know
that he has a reason.

01:43:15.022 --> 01:43:16.512
Yeah, for a while.

01:43:18.025 --> 01:43:19.561
But it didn't work.

01:43:20.069 --> 01:43:22.651
I don't know if it was me...

01:43:24.115 --> 01:43:26.651
It's complicated.

01:43:33.207 --> 01:43:37.371
This scene is set up like a cockfight.

01:43:39.880 --> 01:43:41.290
We see two competitors...

01:43:41.382 --> 01:43:44.590
We see... we are esposito,

01:43:44.677 --> 01:43:49.137
studying the person we want
to get certain information from.

01:43:51.684 --> 01:43:53.470
And we'll stay with him

01:43:55.563 --> 01:43:57.679
in a sequence with almost no cuts.

01:43:57.773 --> 01:44:00.560
Incredible work by Miguel caram here,

01:44:01.736 --> 01:44:04.398
operating the camera. He's the cameraman.

01:44:05.114 --> 01:44:08.982
Everything you're about to see
was filmed with a hand-held camera.

01:44:09.076 --> 01:44:11.533
You'll see cuts
to a couple of reverse angle shots,

01:44:11.620 --> 01:44:14.657
but the entire sequence was filmed
in one take,

01:44:14.749 --> 01:44:18.583
from when morales is reading
to when they finish by the door.

01:44:25.426 --> 01:44:28.759
We go with him. We're on the attack.

01:44:30.306 --> 01:44:32.422
- How do you know?
- I just read it.

01:44:32.600 --> 01:44:35.012
- They found your friend.
- Oh, right.

01:44:36.729 --> 01:44:38.765
He's closing him in gradually.

01:44:39.607 --> 01:44:40.607
No.

01:44:41.150 --> 01:44:43.266
My coworker at the courts.

01:44:45.404 --> 01:44:47.520
They came looking for me,
didn't find me...

01:44:47.948 --> 01:44:49.484
And let him have it.

01:44:49.950 --> 01:44:51.360
Bastards.

01:44:54.622 --> 01:44:55.782
Gomez was never found, right?

01:44:55.831 --> 01:44:58.664
While editing, I studied the possibilities

01:44:58.751 --> 01:45:02.289
of not making that cut we just saw,
and simply stopping on him.

01:45:05.674 --> 01:45:08.040
I decided to leave it.

01:45:08.135 --> 01:45:10.376
I decided to let viewers see

01:45:10.471 --> 01:45:15.010
that moment of weighing how to proceed...

01:45:19.063 --> 01:45:20.599
It was 25 years ago, esposito.

01:45:20.689 --> 01:45:21.958
I was sure you wouldn't be able to.

01:45:21.982 --> 01:45:26.191
But the entire scene, what we're seeing
now, was a continuation of the last one,

01:45:26.278 --> 01:45:28.269
the camera was approaching with esposito.

01:45:30.241 --> 01:45:31.526
Forget it.

01:45:39.458 --> 01:45:41.995
That was the camera moving backward,

01:45:44.755 --> 01:45:47.371
but we get that sense

01:45:47.466 --> 01:45:52.301
of two opponents in a cockfight
coming together and pulling apart.

01:45:53.264 --> 01:45:55.505
I don't know what you want me to say.

01:45:55.599 --> 01:45:58.432
You didn't care
the guy got a free ride.

01:45:58.519 --> 01:45:59.759
There was nothing I could do.

01:46:01.981 --> 01:46:05.769
You spent a year looking for the guy,
they let him go and you do nothing?

01:46:05.860 --> 01:46:08.727
I wasted a year looking for him
and they let him go!

01:46:08.821 --> 01:46:10.311
- What can I do?
- That's it?

01:46:10.447 --> 01:46:12.207
- Yes!
- The rest of your life behind a desk?

01:46:12.491 --> 01:46:14.135
Look who's talking.
You're better than I am.

01:46:14.159 --> 01:46:18.869
He closes in on him again. And every time
esposito ups the pressure and approaches,

01:46:18.956 --> 01:46:20.196
he escapes.

01:46:21.500 --> 01:46:22.831
And he approaches him again.

01:46:23.460 --> 01:46:26.372
Your love for that woman...
I never saw it again.

01:46:26.839 --> 01:46:27.919
In anybody.

01:46:28.549 --> 01:46:29.549
Coming closer every time.

01:46:29.592 --> 01:46:30.877
Nobody.

01:46:31.510 --> 01:46:32.716
Ever.

01:46:36.974 --> 01:46:38.714
Get out of my house.

01:46:40.436 --> 01:46:41.892
He pulls back again.

01:46:42.146 --> 01:46:43.636
Right now, please.

01:46:45.232 --> 01:46:47.518
It's my life, not yours.

01:46:48.193 --> 01:46:51.276
He failed. He needs to
rethink his strategy.

01:46:54.742 --> 01:46:58.280
Change his angle of attack and with it...

01:47:00.915 --> 01:47:02.325
Getting old, that's it.

01:47:03.417 --> 01:47:05.373
We change the camera angle.

01:47:05.753 --> 01:47:07.038
That might be it.

01:47:12.927 --> 01:47:14.918
I couldn't stop thinking about it.

01:47:15.012 --> 01:47:16.673
Go dwell on it at home.

01:47:29.777 --> 01:47:33.895
It seems like he's pulling back slowly,
but instead of going out the door...

01:47:34.615 --> 01:47:36.230
Gomez didn't kill sandoval.

01:47:36.325 --> 01:47:37.531
He attacks again.

01:47:38.285 --> 01:47:39.400
So?

01:47:40.120 --> 01:47:41.906
He knew us both.

01:47:42.206 --> 01:47:45.198
If he'd been there,
he'd have waited for me.

01:47:49.505 --> 01:47:51.211
There's something...

01:47:52.007 --> 01:47:54.089
I had a couple of photos at home,
of myself.

01:47:54.843 --> 01:47:56.299
When sandoval got killed...

01:47:56.553 --> 01:48:00.796
We gradually close the gap between them.

01:48:01.809 --> 01:48:03.640
Nothing else had been touched.

01:48:04.853 --> 01:48:06.138
I thought...

01:48:08.399 --> 01:48:09.559
I think...

01:48:28.127 --> 01:48:29.788
Are you esposito?

01:48:34.216 --> 01:48:35.376
Did you hear what I said...

01:48:35.467 --> 01:48:38.709
We'll never know if this really happened
this way either,

01:48:40.305 --> 01:48:43.513
whether esposito is imagining it

01:48:43.600 --> 01:48:45.932
or it's what he needs to believe.

01:48:46.603 --> 01:48:47.843
Answer me.

01:48:50.858 --> 01:48:52.439
Where are you going?

01:48:53.861 --> 01:48:55.351
- Where are you going?
- Here.

01:48:55.446 --> 01:48:57.186
It doesn't really matter anyway.

01:48:59.033 --> 01:49:01.695
I'm going to put on a record.
It's okay.

01:49:03.746 --> 01:49:05.077
A record?

01:49:05.372 --> 01:49:06.703
Listen to me.

01:49:07.791 --> 01:49:10.407
Are you esposito or not?

01:49:17.676 --> 01:49:19.212
Yes, I am.

01:49:53.754 --> 01:49:55.585
Morales obviously didn't know about this.

01:49:55.672 --> 01:49:58.755
Now they've both lost a loved one.

01:50:00.552 --> 01:50:05.342
Without evaluating the degree of affection

01:50:05.432 --> 01:50:09.016
one can feel for a beloved woman
or a friend,

01:50:09.103 --> 01:50:10.934
this is reflected

01:50:12.147 --> 01:50:14.433
in the two of them sharing the frame.

01:50:14.525 --> 01:50:17.517
One is a continuation of the other,
there's no distance between them.

01:50:19.279 --> 01:50:23.522
We used a happy accident here,

01:50:24.159 --> 01:50:29.279
seeing esposito's eyes
through morales' glasses.

01:50:30.874 --> 01:50:33.616
Memories are all we end up with.

01:50:33.710 --> 01:50:35.496
At least pick the nice ones.

01:50:38.549 --> 01:50:40.210
But there's one thing...

01:50:40.300 --> 01:50:42.336
I know I'll never forget.

01:50:43.679 --> 01:50:46.796
The last thing Pablo said to me
the night they killed him.

01:50:46.890 --> 01:50:49.472
"Don't worry, Benjamin.

01:50:49.560 --> 01:50:51.266
We'll catch that son of a bitch."

01:50:53.605 --> 01:50:55.141
And I will.

01:50:57.317 --> 01:50:59.103
If he's alive, I will.

01:51:05.826 --> 01:51:09.239
Morales' eye tells us much more

01:51:09.955 --> 01:51:14.039
than any words we could shout, or what
seeing his whole face or body could reveal.

01:51:25.637 --> 01:51:29.550
And morales does esposito a favor,
the favor he owed him.

01:51:31.685 --> 01:51:34.142
He gives him an "answer,"

01:51:35.272 --> 01:51:37.308
and frees him from the whole dilemma.

01:51:40.903 --> 01:51:46.648
And in a way, he says, or thinks to himself,
"there's only room for two in this prison."

01:52:16.521 --> 01:52:21.390
The next shot is one of the most complex
in the movie in terms of visual effects.

01:52:23.862 --> 01:52:26.899
We had no control over the trains,
of course.

01:52:26.990 --> 01:52:29.857
We had to shoot
when the train was going by.

01:52:29.952 --> 01:52:32.364
The conditions weren't precise.

01:52:32.454 --> 01:52:35.287
The sky you're about to see is fake.

01:52:39.253 --> 01:52:43.917
At the factory you see in the background,

01:52:44.007 --> 01:52:49.593
there were a number of modern
electrical poles that we had to erase.

01:52:50.138 --> 01:52:53.346
By erasing them, we also had to erase
the reeds behind morales.

01:52:53.433 --> 01:52:56.846
So the reeds you see now are animated.

01:52:56.937 --> 01:52:59.053
They're computer-generated.

01:52:59.147 --> 01:53:03.561
The train was modern,
so we had to create one from that era.

01:53:04.236 --> 01:53:05.851
Those three brief shots you saw

01:53:05.946 --> 01:53:09.530
were some of the most important
and laborious in terms of visual effects.

01:53:14.288 --> 01:53:16.495
Here, when morales leans forward,

01:53:16.581 --> 01:53:20.995
we start to give full meaning

01:53:22.170 --> 01:53:24.832
to the expression, "the eyes speak."

01:53:24.923 --> 01:53:26.333
Was it worth it?

01:53:28.051 --> 01:53:29.541
Forget about it.

01:53:29.928 --> 01:53:31.668
Forget it.

01:53:32.597 --> 01:53:33.928
Who cares?

01:53:34.808 --> 01:53:36.139
My wife is dead.

01:53:36.226 --> 01:53:38.558
We start with...

01:53:40.480 --> 01:53:46.396
Esposito's hazy shoulder
obscures morales' mouth,

01:53:46.486 --> 01:53:48.602
leaving only the eyes.

01:53:50.532 --> 01:53:52.193
Forget about it, trust me.

01:53:54.244 --> 01:53:56.610
You'll end up with only memories.

01:54:01.126 --> 01:54:02.662
I owed you one, right?

01:54:05.130 --> 01:54:06.711
Now we're even.

01:54:24.483 --> 01:54:29.102
The train sequence we saw earlier
was the second hardest to edit.

01:54:29.196 --> 01:54:31.278
This was the hardest.

01:54:31.365 --> 01:54:37.031
Not only for visual,
rhythmic and editing reasons,

01:54:37.120 --> 01:54:41.113
but also in terms of how we rationed
the information.

01:54:41.208 --> 01:54:46.669
I have to thank Camilo antolini,
who edited all my past movies,

01:54:46.755 --> 01:54:49.622
for solving this
with the motif of the four shots.

01:54:49.716 --> 01:54:52.458
The repetition of those four shots.

01:54:52.552 --> 01:54:56.841
Morales said repeatedly,
"they won't get me anywhere."

01:54:59.559 --> 01:55:00.559
Ciao.

01:55:03.313 --> 01:55:05.850
It wasn't another lifetime.
It was this one.

01:55:06.024 --> 01:55:08.891
A guy can do anything to be different.

01:55:09.694 --> 01:55:11.275
What would four bullets get me?

01:55:11.446 --> 01:55:13.562
But there's one thing he can't change.
Not him...

01:55:13.740 --> 01:55:15.401
And the four shots again.

01:55:26.837 --> 01:55:30.705
At this point,
we didn't have to know what happened,

01:55:31.842 --> 01:55:33.173
but we could start setting it up.

01:55:33.260 --> 01:55:38.596
Rationing that information was the hardest
part of this scene and the movie.

01:55:39.266 --> 01:55:44.135
And creating that mood of...
Great sound work here.

01:55:45.147 --> 01:55:47.934
The scorching sun here again.

01:56:01.413 --> 01:56:05.577
Basically, the challenge is to give
a lot of information

01:56:05.667 --> 01:56:07.783
while maintaining a strong mood.

01:56:07.878 --> 01:56:13.544
In general, information and mood don't mix.

01:56:21.766 --> 01:56:22.926
How do you do it?

01:56:33.320 --> 01:56:37.780
The music in the last part of the movie
is excellent.

01:56:37.866 --> 01:56:41.358
It began when esposito was in the car

01:56:41.453 --> 01:56:46.573
and will go on until he writes the note,

01:56:46.666 --> 01:56:48.202
until he corrects the "I fear."

01:56:48.293 --> 01:56:51.251
It's nine and a half minutes
of uninterrupted music

01:56:51.338 --> 01:56:53.795
that spans all moods, from...

01:56:53.882 --> 01:56:58.216
I wouldn't say suspenseful music,
but rather gothic,

01:57:03.183 --> 01:57:06.926
captivating,
because right now it's hypnotic.

01:57:07.020 --> 01:57:10.262
It's propelling us forward, it has drive.

01:57:11.525 --> 01:57:15.268
And it has dramatic changes in key,
I'll tell you when,

01:57:16.947 --> 01:57:18.608
and tone.

01:57:21.535 --> 01:57:22.695
I fucked the shit out of her!

01:57:22.786 --> 01:57:23.821
What retribution?

01:57:23.912 --> 01:57:29.407
It's a subtle, excellent arrangement
by federico jusid.

01:57:29.501 --> 01:57:30.686
It's as if his wife's death...

01:57:30.710 --> 01:57:32.575
Just left him there,
stuck in time forever.

01:57:36.341 --> 01:57:37.797
My wife is dead.

01:57:38.009 --> 01:57:41.467
Your friend is dead.
Gomez is dead too. They're all dead.

01:57:43.682 --> 01:57:45.513
They'd give him an injection...

01:57:45.600 --> 01:57:46.840
And he'd take a nap.

01:57:47.143 --> 01:57:48.724
Nobody, Benjamin.

01:57:49.771 --> 01:57:51.557
Let him grow old.

01:57:52.232 --> 01:57:54.723
Live a life full of nothing.

01:57:55.110 --> 01:57:56.691
How did you start over?

01:57:56.903 --> 01:57:58.985
That was 25 years ago.

01:58:00.073 --> 01:58:02.780
25 years, esposito.

01:58:03.743 --> 01:58:04.983
Forget about it.

01:58:06.955 --> 01:58:10.322
When it seems like the music will rise,
it fades.

01:58:12.002 --> 01:58:15.915
As the music fades,
we move forward, almost physically.

01:58:16.548 --> 01:58:19.255
We stand up in our seat,
we want to see more,

01:58:19.342 --> 01:58:21.549
we want to see better,
we want to hear more.

01:58:22.262 --> 01:58:23.752
We're alert.

01:58:48.705 --> 01:58:50.491
And the music fades even more.

01:59:30.163 --> 01:59:34.406
In one of the first drafts of the script,

01:59:36.461 --> 01:59:41.672
when Gomez saw esposito,
he started screaming wildly,

01:59:41.758 --> 01:59:46.092
"someone came, they found me.
Get me out of here."

01:59:46.179 --> 01:59:49.342
And he kept screaming as esposito left.

01:59:49.432 --> 01:59:52.970
It was aida bortnik
who pointed out the error in that.

01:59:53.061 --> 01:59:56.269
She told us that after 25 years,

01:59:56.356 --> 01:59:59.894
this character would have lost
that attitude long ago,

02:00:01.361 --> 02:00:03.101
he was a broken character.

02:00:03.196 --> 02:00:07.280
She said he should ask for a favor,
the most banal favor possible.

02:00:07.367 --> 02:00:10.700
Tell him at least to talk to me.

02:00:18.420 --> 02:00:20.832
She said this would be much more powerful,
and it was.

02:00:28.722 --> 02:00:30.053
Please.

02:01:13.141 --> 02:01:14.347
You said life.

02:01:29.657 --> 02:01:35.277
How do we go
from a tragic scene like this one

02:01:35.371 --> 02:01:39.865
to the final scene in the movie,
which is practically a love scene?

02:01:39.959 --> 02:01:43.918
Modulatory Bridges were needed here again.

02:01:44.005 --> 02:01:46.041
You'll notice them in the music,

02:01:46.132 --> 02:01:50.546
the direction
and even the dramatic composition.

02:01:50.637 --> 02:01:54.880
The cemetery scene, which is coming up,

02:01:54.974 --> 02:02:00.264
is a scene
where both storylines come together.

02:02:00.897 --> 02:02:04.105
There's the death of sandoval,

02:02:05.401 --> 02:02:07.983
which occurred in the detective story,

02:02:09.864 --> 02:02:14.278
but esposito's visit to sandoval
is part of the movie's human storyline.

02:02:14.369 --> 02:02:16.860
It's a scene of transition.

02:02:18.581 --> 02:02:22.073
This strong change in the visual code

02:02:22.168 --> 02:02:24.409
to a white place colored by flowers.

02:02:24.504 --> 02:02:28.747
When we opened the scene with the flowers, it
looked like we were in a field of flowers,

02:02:28.842 --> 02:02:30.503
but it was just a florist's.

02:02:30.593 --> 02:02:32.754
Pay attention to the music here,

02:02:32.846 --> 02:02:38.261
the way it changes subtly
when he sees the note "I fear."

02:02:47.193 --> 02:02:48.808
I fear

02:02:58.371 --> 02:03:01.158
I love you

02:03:01.374 --> 02:03:03.865
it's brilliant.

02:03:03.960 --> 02:03:06.417
That change is incredible

02:03:06.504 --> 02:03:09.667
and it enables us
to perform an impossible balancing act.

02:03:19.559 --> 02:03:21.925
- Is she in?
- Yeah, in her office.

02:03:25.648 --> 02:03:31.314
The movie doesn't say what esposito does
with what he learns at morales' house.

02:03:33.156 --> 02:03:37.741
It's not necessary at this moment,
for this story,

02:03:37.827 --> 02:03:40.534
but we can guess what he does later.

02:03:40.622 --> 02:03:44.240
We know his character well enough.

02:03:45.460 --> 02:03:50.671
We intentionally didn't
show it in the movie

02:03:50.757 --> 02:03:52.588
so we could spark that debate.

02:03:52.675 --> 02:03:57.169
We thought that if the question people
asked at the café after the theater was,

02:03:57.263 --> 02:04:01.006
"what would esposito do,
knowing that Gomez is in that cell?"

02:04:02.101 --> 02:04:05.935
This question would quickly become,
"what would I do?"

02:04:09.233 --> 02:04:13.101
And that's what we wanted to ask
in the movie.

02:04:14.030 --> 02:04:15.315
Shut the door.

02:04:21.329 --> 02:04:23.035
I hope you enjoyed it.

02:04:28.294 --> 02:04:31.411
The secret in their eyes
