01:09.070 --> 01:10.071
Again.

01:11.655 --> 01:13.991
What happened in that motel room?

01:15.534 --> 01:18.913
It was coupon night
and I was trampolining your wife.

01:20.581 --> 01:23.375
You're a real comedian, aren't you, Snow?

01:24.919 --> 01:28.005
Well, I guess that's why they call it
the punch line.

01:28.672 --> 01:30.716
You don't like me, do you?

01:30.800 --> 01:32.760
Don't flatter yourself. I don't like anybody.

01:32.843 --> 01:35.471
With that attitude
I can see why nobody likes you.

01:35.554 --> 01:37.098
Come on.

01:37.181 --> 01:39.350
People love me.

01:39.433 --> 01:41.185
Just ask your wife.

01:44.522 --> 01:47.191
What happened in that room in New York?

01:49.360 --> 01:50.986
What? What was the question?

01:58.119 --> 02:00.538
What happened in that room?

02:50.963 --> 02:53.424
<i>- Mace?</i>
<i>- Why do you never answer your phone?</i>

02:53.507 --> 02:54.550
What the hell's going on?

02:54.633 --> 02:56.302
<i>Listen. You have to get out, okay?</i>

02:56.385 --> 02:59.513
<i>It's a double cross. They're coming for you.</i>
<i>You have to get out now!</i>

02:59.597 --> 03:01.265
Yeah. Yeah, okay.

03:02.808 --> 03:05.186
Who was the mystery man on the phone?

03:05.269 --> 03:06.270
His name was Fuck You.

03:06.520 --> 03:08.022
- Really?
- Yeah, he was Asian.

03:12.776 --> 03:14.403
I don't like hurting you, Snow.

03:16.113 --> 03:17.364
Is that why you're having him do it?

03:17.448 --> 03:20.701
I can have Rupert bludgeon you all night.

03:21.118 --> 03:23.370
I'm being beaten up by a guy called Rupert?

03:23.454 --> 03:25.456
What happened with the Colonel?

03:28.459 --> 03:29.460
Shit.

03:31.587 --> 03:32.963
Hey, buddy.

03:33.714 --> 03:34.715
No, no, no, Frank.

03:35.633 --> 03:36.634
You're gonna be fine.

03:36.717 --> 03:39.428
Don't let them take this.

03:41.680 --> 03:43.307
Yeah, okay.

03:44.058 --> 03:45.601
Stay with me.

03:46.018 --> 03:48.270
Come on, you're gonna be okay.

03:49.146 --> 03:50.314
Frank.

04:18.841 --> 04:20.094
Returning fire.

04:35.901 --> 04:37.111
God, I hate heights.

05:03.512 --> 05:04.513
Watch out!

05:43.761 --> 05:45.721
<i>- Mace!</i>
<i>- Where are you?</i>

05:51.810 --> 05:53.896
<i>Get to the subway, Wilson platform 10.</i>

05:53.979 --> 05:57.232
<i>And dump the phone!</i>
<i>They're using it to track you!</i>

06:35.729 --> 06:36.730
We have him now!

06:39.024 --> 06:40.025
Don't move!

06:46.657 --> 06:48.700
And that's when you showed up.

06:48.784 --> 06:51.203
We had the Colonel under surveillance.

06:51.328 --> 06:53.789
He was selling secrets
about our space programs.

06:53.872 --> 06:54.998
Well, that's interesting

06:55.416 --> 06:57.292
because Frank told me
he was protecting them.

06:57.376 --> 07:00.170
Did he tell you this
before or after you killed him?

07:00.337 --> 07:01.922
Why would I kill him?
He was a friend of mine.

07:02.005 --> 07:03.507
You're right.

07:09.638 --> 07:12.099
- That's not what happened.
- I saw it with my own eyes.

07:12.516 --> 07:14.143
Running out of jokes, are we?

07:15.853 --> 07:17.813
You setting me up? Is that what this is?

07:17.896 --> 07:22.025
All we know is that the Colonel arranged
for a meeting in that motel

07:22.109 --> 07:23.902
and somehow,

07:25.154 --> 07:26.989
you showed up and killed him. Pop.

07:27.156 --> 07:29.867
You know,
this may come as a surprise to you,

07:29.950 --> 07:32.411
but Frank didn't trust you guys anymore,

07:32.494 --> 07:34.288
so he asked me to back him up.

07:34.580 --> 07:38.041
He wanted someone from outside the agency.
You know, to protect the package.

07:38.125 --> 07:39.334
Who was your backup guy?

07:39.418 --> 07:41.628
Why do I get the feeling not telling you

07:41.712 --> 07:43.380
is the only thing keeping him alive?

07:43.672 --> 07:46.175
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Come on.
Come on, guys.

07:46.258 --> 07:47.843
Play nice.

07:47.926 --> 07:50.846
- You mind?
- No. He's all yours.

07:50.929 --> 07:52.264
Get those off of him, please.

07:55.058 --> 07:58.312
I can't tell if he's stupid or a really good liar.

07:58.395 --> 08:01.106
Either way, M.S. One
would have been good for him.

08:03.775 --> 08:05.819
Guy's a tool. Nut?

08:06.487 --> 08:07.821
Nah, I'm trying to give them up.

08:07.905 --> 08:11.241
I was sorry to hear about Frank.
He was one of the good guys.

08:11.533 --> 08:14.203
Snow, you gotta give me something.

08:14.286 --> 08:16.246
Otherwise, I can't help you.

08:16.330 --> 08:18.248
Tell me what I can do to help, Snow.

08:19.041 --> 08:20.042
Shoot Langral?

08:20.542 --> 08:23.754
- Anything else?
- Can you pick me up something?

08:23.837 --> 08:25.672
I can. What and where?

08:25.797 --> 08:28.008
I don't know.

08:28.091 --> 08:30.260
Last time I saw it, it was on a train.

08:48.737 --> 08:50.197
Hey, buddy. Hey!

08:56.537 --> 08:58.038
Tell me who the backup guy was.

08:58.121 --> 08:59.373
You think I'm gonna tell you that?

08:59.581 --> 09:01.500
You'll go straight to your boss.

09:08.799 --> 09:12.177
Well, I guess this conversation's over.

09:15.931 --> 09:17.391
It's good to see you.

09:22.646 --> 09:26.817
I need a PoICom Tag
and a trace on a name. Mace.

09:39.329 --> 09:41.623
- Mr. President.
- Scott, come in.

09:42.207 --> 09:44.876
This is just routine. Won't take two seconds.

09:44.960 --> 09:46.378
Thank you.

09:48.130 --> 09:49.881
They check this damn thing five times a year.

09:51.383 --> 09:53.260
So, what have we got?

09:53.343 --> 09:55.262
He claims he was set up.

09:55.345 --> 09:56.346
Was he?

09:56.847 --> 09:59.933
I saw him shoot Armstrong
with my own eyes, sir.

10:01.518 --> 10:02.603
What a mess!

10:02.853 --> 10:04.813
So what do you want us to do about him?

10:05.022 --> 10:06.898
I don't even want to know. Just fix it.

10:07.274 --> 10:10.485
We're pretty much done here.
I just need to see the First Daughter.

10:10.694 --> 10:14.156
Emilie has had a change in schedule.
She's on a humanitarian errand.

10:14.531 --> 10:15.532
Is she even in Washington?

10:15.907 --> 10:17.242
<i>Well, not exactly.</i>

10:17.326 --> 10:19.870
<i>Ground control to LM22, do you copy?</i>

10:19.953 --> 10:21.663
<i>- Loud and clear.</i>
<i>- It's amazing.</i>

10:22.748 --> 10:24.916
- Is this your first time in orbit?
- No.

10:25.208 --> 10:28.253
My father took me up in the Hilton Orbital
after my mother passed.

10:28.503 --> 10:30.672
Would you like a quick briefing
before we arrive?

10:30.756 --> 10:31.757
Please.

10:31.840 --> 10:34.301
M.S. One
has been a very successful experiment

10:34.426 --> 10:37.846
with the first 500 test cases
serving time without incident.

10:37.929 --> 10:39.598
Once we open for business properly,

10:39.765 --> 10:40.849
we'll be able to rent space

10:40.932 --> 10:44.770
to 500,000 prisoners and counting,
with all countries signed up.

10:45.062 --> 10:47.147
All overseen
by the United States of America.

10:47.230 --> 10:48.273
Which is why I'm here.

10:48.357 --> 10:52.527
M.S. One is the only Supermax facility
in existence

10:52.611 --> 10:55.489
where there is no physical or sexual abuse,

10:55.572 --> 10:57.449
breakouts or riots.

10:57.532 --> 10:58.992
Because you put the prisoners to sleep?

10:59.076 --> 11:00.535
It's called stasis.

11:00.619 --> 11:03.372
Of course, but there are a few issues
with stasis, are there not?

11:03.455 --> 11:06.166
Aggression due to damage of the cortex,

11:06.249 --> 11:08.168
dementia, psychosis.

11:08.251 --> 11:09.252
Well, you know the press.

11:11.088 --> 11:12.798
Good news doesn't sell.

11:13.382 --> 11:15.258
Those were early teething problems.

11:15.384 --> 11:17.886
The U.S.
has absolutely nothing to worry about.

11:18.011 --> 11:19.680
<i>You are entering United States airspace.</i>

11:19.763 --> 11:21.640
- We're approaching. Would you like to see it?
- I'd love to.

11:21.723 --> 11:23.600
<i>This is penal area M. S. One.</i>

11:23.934 --> 11:27.145
<i>446 requesting identification code.</i>

11:35.278 --> 11:36.446
<i>LM22, we need your coordinates...</i>

11:36.530 --> 11:39.658
The defense system is automatic
and solar assisted,

11:40.200 --> 11:44.121
oxygen-fed, auto lock,
100-millimeter pacifiers

11:44.246 --> 11:45.706
made by Milland aerospace.

11:45.789 --> 11:48.166
<i>LM22, please transmit clearance.</i>

11:48.458 --> 11:49.459
What are they doing?

11:49.960 --> 11:53.296
Parts of M.S. One are still under construction
and need constant maintenance.

11:53.547 --> 11:55.340
<i>LM22, you are on final approach.</i>

11:55.882 --> 11:58.093
<i>Maintain your current speed and heading.</i>

12:03.849 --> 12:05.559
- Can everyone please sign in?
- How are you, sir?

12:05.642 --> 12:09.146
There are just a few basic precautions here.
Won't take long.

12:09.521 --> 12:11.690
- Thanks, Sam. Can I get my holster?
- There you go, sir.

12:12.274 --> 12:15.736
Please, keep your radiation tags on you
at all times.

12:15.819 --> 12:18.488
In the event of a problem,
they will beep and flash yellow.

12:18.572 --> 12:20.198
Would you please take the elevator
to the third floor?

12:21.992 --> 12:24.661
Mr. Barnes, isn't M.S. One's true purpose

12:24.745 --> 12:27.956
to test the effects of deep space exploration
on humans?

12:28.206 --> 12:29.666
Who better than guinea pigs with no rights?

12:29.958 --> 12:31.334
I've heard that urban legend.

12:31.752 --> 12:35.589
Look, Ms. Warnock,
these men aren't traffic offenders.

12:35.756 --> 12:38.341
They've done some pretty awful things
to get in here.

12:38.425 --> 12:39.676
Of course.

12:39.760 --> 12:43.013
But is it purely coincidental
that one of the main sources of funding

12:43.096 --> 12:45.390
is a deep space exploration company?

12:45.557 --> 12:49.102
Surely you don't think they're paying out
millions of dollars to be civically minded?

12:49.186 --> 12:52.272
Ms. Warnock, I'm just an old prison warden.

12:52.355 --> 12:56.193
I couldn't speculate
on the motives of global corporations.

12:56.276 --> 12:58.069
Anyway, isn't Milland aerospace

12:58.153 --> 13:01.031
the largest contributor
to your charity group?

13:02.199 --> 13:04.451
But one thing doesn't have to do
with the other.

13:04.534 --> 13:05.702
Right?

13:06.703 --> 13:08.330
Sure it doesn't.

13:10.290 --> 13:12.250
We're going to put on a little show.

13:12.334 --> 13:16.421
You'll get to meet a couple of convicts
and have a scary story to tell your friends.

13:16.588 --> 13:17.631
And let's just hope

13:17.714 --> 13:19.508
that when you sign off on this place,

13:19.716 --> 13:22.844
we can all get back
to making the world a better place.

13:23.970 --> 13:25.639
After you, ma'am.

13:26.681 --> 13:29.059
This is General Population.

13:37.567 --> 13:40.946
<i>All employees in Sector 4, please stand clear.</i>

13:43.073 --> 13:44.115
Jesus.

13:46.326 --> 13:47.327
Pretty impressive?

13:47.577 --> 13:48.703
- Yes, it is.
- Now,

13:48.787 --> 13:50.455
we've prepared an interview room for you.

13:50.622 --> 13:52.249
We're going to need to have a look
at that room.

13:52.415 --> 13:53.416
Well, that's fine.

13:53.500 --> 13:55.585
One thing,
on the prisoners' side of the room,

13:55.794 --> 13:57.045
we don't allow weapons.

14:00.257 --> 14:01.633
Thank you.

14:02.092 --> 14:03.093
Thanks.

14:07.931 --> 14:10.100
- Okay?
- Yeah, all set.

14:21.278 --> 14:22.279
There you are.

14:22.445 --> 14:24.489
Yeah. I thought I could smell you coming.

14:24.573 --> 14:26.491
I'm here to tell you the good news, Snow.

14:26.575 --> 14:29.286
You're finally getting spayed?
Congratulations.

14:29.411 --> 14:31.538
You've been convicted. First degree murder

14:31.621 --> 14:35.625
and conspiracy to commit espionage
against the United States.

14:36.251 --> 14:38.962
That's the setup.
Do you want to hear the punch line?

14:39.629 --> 14:40.797
Yeah, I'm dying to.

14:40.881 --> 14:43.133
M.S. One. 30-year stasis.

14:43.383 --> 14:45.427
No parole. Effective immediately.

14:45.510 --> 14:48.430
And nothing about a constitutional right
to a fair hearing?

14:48.513 --> 14:50.974
I think you waived that right
when you shot Armstrong.

14:51.057 --> 14:53.727
Yeah, of course. I forgot that part. I'm sorry.

14:53.810 --> 14:56.104
You know what they say
about being put under?

14:56.313 --> 14:58.773
That some minds just can't take it.

14:59.190 --> 15:00.859
I'm looking forward to it.

15:00.942 --> 15:02.402
Sweet dreams.

15:16.499 --> 15:18.835
I don't know about you,
but I can't drive home.

15:26.343 --> 15:27.928
Mr. Hydell.

15:28.011 --> 15:29.387
How are you feeling?

15:32.599 --> 15:34.351
Are you experiencing any disorientation?

15:34.684 --> 15:36.186
I can't see out of that eye anymore.

15:36.353 --> 15:38.355
And what happened to your face,
did you burn it?

15:38.438 --> 15:40.690
Yeah, it's a love bite.

15:41.566 --> 15:42.901
- I see.
- Yeah.

15:43.360 --> 15:46.738
I'm going to ask you a few questions
about your experience and treatment here.

15:46.863 --> 15:48.448
Do you dream while you're under?

15:48.531 --> 15:51.618
Well, I'm gonna dream about you. Aren't I?

15:51.868 --> 15:53.745
I'd appreciate it
if you'd take it seriously, though.

15:53.828 --> 15:56.164
It's very serious. Very serious.

15:56.373 --> 15:59.334
So, it says here you were convicted
of aggravated physical assault.

16:00.001 --> 16:00.961
No,

16:01.044 --> 16:05.090
I'm innocent. That wasn't me.
That's a case of mistaken identity.

16:06.216 --> 16:07.217
Fifty-three counts?

16:07.342 --> 16:09.386
I've a very familiar face.

16:10.220 --> 16:11.429
It's not like your face.

16:12.222 --> 16:14.391
You've a very kind face.

16:14.474 --> 16:17.644
It's lovely. You're perfect, you are.
I bet you got a nice smile.

16:17.727 --> 16:20.522
Do a little smile for me. Oh, smile.

16:20.605 --> 16:21.606
You've got a lovely smile!

16:21.982 --> 16:23.358
Easy.

16:24.401 --> 16:25.986
- Hock.
- Answer the question.

16:26.444 --> 16:27.445
Stay out of this, please.

16:28.863 --> 16:30.073
What's that smell in here?

16:30.407 --> 16:31.491
Calm down.

16:34.869 --> 16:37.038
You're wearing perfume, aren't you?

16:37.539 --> 16:39.374
- Mr. Hydell.
- Answer the question.

16:39.457 --> 16:40.458
- Hock!
- You're a filthy article, man.

16:40.542 --> 16:41.501
You are a bad man!

16:41.584 --> 16:42.585
What's wrong with you? You wanna test me?

16:43.503 --> 16:44.504
- Sit down!
- Hock!

16:44.587 --> 16:46.631
- Okay. You wanna test me?
- Hock!

16:47.007 --> 16:49.592
Do you know what I was
before I was convicted of rape, cock?

16:49.676 --> 16:51.261
- Surprise me, shithead.
- Hock! Stop!

16:51.344 --> 16:52.345
I was a pickpocket.

16:56.057 --> 16:57.225
He's got a gun!

17:26.546 --> 17:28.757
<i>M. S. One Control, we are...</i>

17:43.563 --> 17:47.317
Sir? There seems to be a fire alarm
on M.S. One.

17:49.402 --> 17:50.528
- Hide.
- What?

17:50.820 --> 17:51.988
- Hide.
- What?

17:52.155 --> 17:53.239
Hide?

17:55.575 --> 17:56.993
Hello.

17:57.160 --> 17:59.204
- Where is she?
- Who? Who? What? What?

17:59.287 --> 18:02.040
"Who? Who? What? What?"
Don't lie to me, man. I'll eat your brain.

18:02.123 --> 18:05.376
- I'm not lying to you, man.
- Control room active.

18:09.214 --> 18:10.215
Stay there.

18:25.396 --> 18:26.606
Hairdo!

18:27.816 --> 18:30.568
Are you all right, man?
Have I hurt your nose?

18:30.652 --> 18:32.946
Come here. Get up, man.

18:33.029 --> 18:35.031
Come here.

18:35.115 --> 18:36.741
Sit down.

18:36.825 --> 18:39.702
Open them all up right now.
Every single one.

18:39.786 --> 18:41.412
No, I don't think that's a good...

18:41.496 --> 18:42.956
Think? You should think?

18:43.039 --> 18:44.874
Okay. Okay. Okay.

18:45.125 --> 18:48.211
<i>- Okay, okay, okay, okay. Get it done.</i>
<i>- Canisters open.</i>

19:04.144 --> 19:05.895
Good. That's a good job, man.

19:07.689 --> 19:10.900
<i>Remember, safety is our first priority.</i>

19:11.401 --> 19:14.779
<i>It has been 364 days since our last incident.</i>

19:15.905 --> 19:17.490
<i>Good work, team.</i>

19:27.500 --> 19:29.586
- Go! Go! Go!
- Come on.

20:06.539 --> 20:07.749
No.

20:14.547 --> 20:15.548
Damn.

20:25.934 --> 20:28.519
Hit the sleeping gas. Hit it!

20:28.895 --> 20:30.730
2, 3, 5...

20:35.193 --> 20:36.194
Easy!

20:39.489 --> 20:41.032
- Get up. Get up!
- No! No!

20:46.871 --> 20:48.039
In less than an hour,

20:48.498 --> 20:51.000
all these people, including young

20:52.585 --> 20:54.045
Emilie Warnock here,

20:54.337 --> 20:56.506
will be the only thing keeping us alive.

20:57.382 --> 20:59.342
You don't mess with your poker chips.

21:03.221 --> 21:06.516
<i>M. S. One, this is L.O.P.D.</i>
<i>Do you copy? Over.</i>

21:07.475 --> 21:08.476
What's going on?

21:10.186 --> 21:11.187
Company-

21:13.564 --> 21:17.151
<i>Smoke leakage on the starboard hull,</i>
<i>possibly halon.</i>

21:18.152 --> 21:19.696
Look who I found, man!

21:20.321 --> 21:21.364
Get off the door, man.

21:21.531 --> 21:23.449
Found you a proper egghead.

21:23.533 --> 21:25.910
Turn on the guns. Here. Calm down.

21:26.536 --> 21:27.996
There you go.

21:28.746 --> 21:30.415
That's clever, isn't it? Okey-dokey.

21:31.374 --> 21:32.500
Leave it.

21:32.583 --> 21:34.627
Why leave it, man? Come on.

21:34.711 --> 21:36.004
I said, leave it.

21:43.011 --> 21:44.053
<i>Copy that.</i>

21:44.178 --> 21:46.431
<i>Keep all eyes open. Full recon mission.</i>

21:46.597 --> 21:48.474
<i>- Establish M. S. One status...</i>
<i>- Moving out.</i>

21:51.060 --> 21:52.478
Serious.

21:56.983 --> 21:58.109
Sorry!

22:00.653 --> 22:03.448
<i>- We're taking fire.</i>
<i>- They have opened fire.</i>

22:11.289 --> 22:12.540
You think you're running the show?

22:12.874 --> 22:15.126
Get this into your thick skull.

22:15.418 --> 22:17.795
- You're not running the show.
- Sorry.

22:29.724 --> 22:31.893
- Mr. President.
- Everybody out.

22:32.769 --> 22:34.395
Now! Get out!

22:35.188 --> 22:36.981
Sir, within the last hour,

22:37.106 --> 22:39.484
there has been a massive infraction

22:39.567 --> 22:41.944
on Supermax M.S. One.

22:42.028 --> 22:43.446
- It's a takeover.
- Oh, God.

22:43.780 --> 22:45.281
Emilie. Is she...

22:45.365 --> 22:47.408
She's fine, according to her telemetry,

22:47.700 --> 22:49.577
but the situation is critical.

22:49.660 --> 22:52.955
We can have special forces up there
on site within six hours.

22:53.456 --> 22:54.957
To do what exactly?

22:57.001 --> 23:00.338
I just mean, what order do we give,
Mr. President?

23:00.505 --> 23:02.340
- What are you saying?
- I'm asking,

23:02.673 --> 23:05.134
are we talking about saving all the hostages?

23:05.426 --> 23:07.678
Or are we talking about saving
just one in particular?

23:07.804 --> 23:09.722
Now we can send in the Marines,

23:09.806 --> 23:11.933
but we have no real idea of the whereabouts

23:12.433 --> 23:13.893
of your daughter on board.

23:14.143 --> 23:16.437
As soon as we launch
this large-scale offensive,

23:16.521 --> 23:17.980
my guess is...

23:18.981 --> 23:20.483
Well, she's as good as dead, sir.

23:21.692 --> 23:22.693
Or...

23:23.945 --> 23:25.655
What?

23:25.738 --> 23:27.490
We can send in one man.

23:28.282 --> 23:31.411
One man with one very specific order.

23:31.494 --> 23:33.663
To get Emilie Warnock out.

23:34.789 --> 23:35.790
Who?

23:37.708 --> 23:40.962
I'd rather castrate myself with blunt rocks.

23:41.045 --> 23:42.839
Why don't you get Rupert to do it?

23:42.922 --> 23:44.048
Hey. How's it going?

23:44.257 --> 23:46.050
This is the best offer you'll get.

23:46.134 --> 23:47.927
Don't get me wrong. It's a dream vacation.

23:48.010 --> 23:51.139
I mean, I load up, I go into space,

23:51.222 --> 23:53.808
I get inside the maximum-security nuthouse,

23:54.016 --> 23:56.561
save the President's daughter
if she's not dead already,

23:56.644 --> 23:58.479
get past all the psychos
who've just woken up.

23:58.855 --> 24:00.565
I'm thrilled that you would think of me.

24:02.483 --> 24:04.193
See you in 30 years.

24:06.237 --> 24:07.613
Wait.

24:07.697 --> 24:10.825
Snow, you should really think about this.

24:10.908 --> 24:13.411
Because it could benefit all of us.

24:22.837 --> 24:24.046
Okay, I'm joking. I'll do it.

24:31.554 --> 24:33.181
Frank's lighter.

25:02.585 --> 25:03.586
Here, put this on.

25:14.722 --> 25:17.517
<i>Please proceed to the shuttle immediately.</i>

25:19.310 --> 25:21.354
<i>LM23, you are clear for takeoff.</i>

25:29.362 --> 25:32.073
So, how many prisoners exactly?

25:32.156 --> 25:33.950
497.

25:34.283 --> 25:37.036
Mainly rapists and murderers.
You'll fit right in.

25:37.286 --> 25:38.955
How do we know she's not dead already?

25:39.038 --> 25:41.165
She's wearing
a telemetry medical transmitter.

25:41.249 --> 25:42.792
All the First Family have them.

25:42.959 --> 25:45.336
- Nice to live in the big white house?
- So we know she's alive.

25:45.711 --> 25:50.216
And she has had some blood loss,
but it's nothing life-threatening. So far.

25:50.466 --> 25:55.096
So, if I actually find her and she is alive,

25:55.179 --> 25:56.806
how do we get off the ship?

25:56.973 --> 25:58.516
Easy. Hitch a ride, man.

25:59.141 --> 26:00.977
There's an escape pod on level five.

26:01.185 --> 26:03.229
It's not on any of the schematics,

26:03.312 --> 26:05.731
but you can find it on this map.

26:05.815 --> 26:06.983
It'll guide you to the pod

26:08.818 --> 26:09.986
and give you the access code.

26:10.444 --> 26:13.698
The pod will take the two of you
off M.S. One.

26:13.906 --> 26:14.907
Is that clear?

26:15.032 --> 26:16.075
Yeah, clear as mud.

26:16.826 --> 26:18.077
- Here.
- What's that for?

26:19.370 --> 26:20.580
Climbing down off sidewalks?

26:20.663 --> 26:21.664
No, no,no.

26:22.373 --> 26:25.835
It's explosives. You join those two ends,
you got a nine-second charge.

26:25.918 --> 26:30.006
It's grade two, for opening
heavy secure panels or bulkheads.

26:30.089 --> 26:31.382
Bulkheads?

26:47.565 --> 26:49.233
- I gotta get out of here.
- That's enough!

26:49.525 --> 26:50.651
I gotta get out of here.

26:56.949 --> 26:59.076
That's okay.

26:59.160 --> 27:00.536
You go to sleep now.

27:05.666 --> 27:07.043
Anyone else?

27:10.963 --> 27:13.758
I'm gonna need a doctor
to get this stitched up.

27:19.055 --> 27:20.056
Thank you.

27:20.765 --> 27:22.308
Hey, lab coat.

27:22.391 --> 27:24.477
You, move! Doc, let's go.

27:24.560 --> 27:26.937
- Hey, wait, she's not a doctor.
- Easy there, tough guy. Easy.

27:27.021 --> 27:30.608
- Okay.
- Let's go. Get your ass up. Get your ass up.

27:39.617 --> 27:40.618
Stitch it up.

27:55.174 --> 27:57.510
Hey, wait a second.
What the hell is going on here?

27:57.593 --> 27:59.345
We're taking over.

27:59.428 --> 28:00.971
And who are you?

28:01.055 --> 28:03.265
Secret Service.

28:03.349 --> 28:05.309
I didn't hear anything about this.

28:05.393 --> 28:08.729
That will be why they call it secret, right?

28:08.813 --> 28:10.398
What's happening?

28:10.481 --> 28:12.066
They demanded a negotiator.

28:12.149 --> 28:15.069
He's prepping now.
They've been leaving a live feed open.

28:17.196 --> 28:19.365
This is Special Agent Scott Langral

28:19.448 --> 28:21.659
and I'm in charge of this situation.

28:23.160 --> 28:24.161
<i>In charge?</i>

28:24.870 --> 28:27.623
<i>That's where you're very much mistaken.</i>

28:30.209 --> 28:32.586
So there she is. Right in the hornet's nest.

28:32.670 --> 28:34.255
Let me know when you've picked up on it,
won't you?

28:34.338 --> 28:36.465
When I want your opinion,
I'm gonna give it to you.

28:38.801 --> 28:39.969
Okay.

28:40.428 --> 28:41.804
Hey.

28:41.887 --> 28:43.556
Picked up on what?

28:44.140 --> 28:45.182
Oh, nothing. You know,

28:45.266 --> 28:47.852
just that they don't know they've got
the President's daughter, that's all.

28:50.688 --> 28:51.939
So,

28:52.815 --> 28:54.692
- do you like working in space?
- Yeah, I like it.

28:54.775 --> 28:57.069
- You do? Do you get dizzy?
- Yeah, sometimes.

28:57.153 --> 28:58.404
Sometimes? Yeah, I would.

28:58.487 --> 29:00.948
Hey, Snow. How do you figure that out?

29:01.490 --> 29:03.743
Far be it from me to teach you
how to suck eggs,

29:03.826 --> 29:05.828
but you'd think
they might have said something.

29:06.912 --> 29:10.040
And they've got her playing doctor.
I'm just saying.

29:10.666 --> 29:13.753
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>can I have your attention?</i>

29:13.961 --> 29:16.672
<i>We've prepared a little demonstration.</i>

29:20.301 --> 29:22.762
Barnes? Hello, Barnes?

29:23.053 --> 29:25.014
Gotta make sure, man. Let me find...

29:26.182 --> 29:29.477
Listen, if you're gonna shit yourself,
now would be the perfect time, wouldn't it?

29:29.560 --> 29:30.853
Go on, boys.

29:30.978 --> 29:32.938
No. No!

29:35.316 --> 29:36.317
Here we go.

29:36.525 --> 29:37.860
Reality TV.

29:38.694 --> 29:40.821
- No! No!
- Oh, no!

29:40.905 --> 29:41.906
No, no,no, no.

29:42.031 --> 29:43.699
- I can help you!
- Can you help me?

29:43.991 --> 29:46.994
- I can help you!
- You're gonna need the help, boyo.

29:47.077 --> 29:48.537
It's a bit chilly out there tonight.

29:48.871 --> 29:50.122
Don't do this.

29:50.206 --> 29:53.626
Don't do this. Wait! Wait! I can help you!

29:54.668 --> 29:55.836
Wait!

29:56.545 --> 29:59.381
Bye-bye, Barnes.

29:59.882 --> 30:01.884
Bye-bye, Barnes.

30:02.009 --> 30:04.136
No, I can help. Wait! The girl!

30:04.220 --> 30:05.262
What about her?

30:05.805 --> 30:07.515
The girl! The girl!

30:07.723 --> 30:09.517
- She's the President's...
- Yep.

30:12.061 --> 30:14.063
Man! Did you see the look on his face?

30:14.438 --> 30:15.606
He was about to say something.

30:15.689 --> 30:17.900
He was about to say something like...

30:22.738 --> 30:23.948
Okay.

30:26.408 --> 30:27.493
<i>The clock is reset.</i>

30:27.952 --> 30:29.787
<i>One hour and counting until the next show,</i>

30:30.037 --> 30:32.206
<i>so I'd get my skates on if I were you.</i>

30:33.707 --> 30:37.795
Hey, tell me you are not still thinking
of negotiating with these psychos.

30:37.920 --> 30:40.464
This is all over the news in six hours.

30:40.589 --> 30:41.674
Then they're going to know who she is.

30:41.757 --> 30:43.342
We should just stick to the plan.

30:43.425 --> 30:45.469
The plan?
You can send your boy in if you want.

30:45.553 --> 30:48.222
I'm just doing what's best for the situation
right now.

30:48.556 --> 30:49.682
Right?

30:49.765 --> 30:51.100
Thank you.

30:52.226 --> 30:53.978
- I'm happy not to go.
- You're going.

30:54.061 --> 30:55.604
- Okay.
- Go now.

30:56.564 --> 30:57.773
All right.

31:14.957 --> 31:16.959
Hey, easy, easy, big guy-

31:17.251 --> 31:19.587
It's all right. It's okay. It's okay, easy.

31:19.920 --> 31:22.298
Things you asked for are on the way.

31:22.631 --> 31:24.383
Is everybody okay?

31:26.302 --> 31:28.262
For the time being, sure.

31:28.971 --> 31:31.390
We're doing our bit. I was wondering,
what are you going to do for us?

31:31.682 --> 31:34.602
Don't tell me, you're looking for a hostage.

31:35.394 --> 31:36.687
That certainly would be a good start.

31:36.770 --> 31:38.022
Hey, four eyes.

31:38.397 --> 31:40.316
Ain't no one leaving, man.

31:40.482 --> 31:42.151
No. You hear me? No.

31:43.569 --> 31:45.154
Can I talk to you privately for a minute?

31:48.949 --> 31:52.411
If this works
I'll wear a tutu and pink pantyhose.

31:52.494 --> 31:54.622
<i>Snow, let's be ready, okay?</i>

31:57.041 --> 31:58.208
<i>Okay.</i>

32:03.464 --> 32:05.466
This thing is contained right now.

32:05.549 --> 32:07.593
But you keep blasting people out the airlock,

32:07.676 --> 32:10.930
the press gets involved and all bets are off
and nobody goes anywhere.

32:11.096 --> 32:13.849
Now, you look like a smart guy,
so I'm gonna let you in on a little secret.

32:13.933 --> 32:15.059
They're going to let you go.

32:15.142 --> 32:18.312
But you really think
they're gonna let 500 convicts go?

32:18.395 --> 32:20.814
You, maybe five or six others,
can get out of here.

32:21.065 --> 32:22.107
It's what we call breakage.

32:22.191 --> 32:23.525
Why should I give up a hostage?

32:23.609 --> 32:26.195
You know why they really ask for a hostage,
don%you?

32:26.320 --> 32:29.823
<i>Because it tells them one important thing.</i>
<i>This guy is in charge here.</i>

32:30.032 --> 32:31.825
Maybe you're not the guy
who makes decisions around here.

32:33.410 --> 32:34.453
Don't go there.

32:34.703 --> 32:36.914
<i>I'm definitely the man</i>
<i>you should be talking to.</i>

32:37.122 --> 32:39.333
Okay, all right.
Show me you're in charge then.

32:39.416 --> 32:40.751
Give me a hostage.

32:41.001 --> 32:43.337
- Can I trust you?
- You can trust me.

32:48.717 --> 32:50.302
Let's hold on.

32:50.761 --> 32:53.847
This stuffed shirt may well pull this off.

32:54.807 --> 32:57.726
<i>Jesus! Coming, going. Make up your minds.</i>

32:57.935 --> 33:00.104
- One hostage?
- One.

33:00.354 --> 33:02.940
- Who do you want?
- Whoever. Usually one of the wounded,

33:03.023 --> 33:05.609
or, I don't know, maybe a woman.

33:05.693 --> 33:08.195
A wounded woman's always popular.

33:08.278 --> 33:09.655
Okay, we got eight principals,

33:09.947 --> 33:13.117
four low-vel riot shotguns, three Berettas,
low-vel semis.

33:15.244 --> 33:16.578
You choose.

33:25.254 --> 33:26.755
Up. Get up.

33:26.839 --> 33:28.590
- Why me?
- Get up.

33:29.008 --> 33:30.926
Honey, you'll be fine.

33:31.719 --> 33:33.929
Looks like my plan is working.

33:34.638 --> 33:35.931
Sorry.

33:40.394 --> 33:41.603
What's going on here?

33:41.895 --> 33:43.981
Not her. Not her. No, no, no, no. Not her.

33:44.273 --> 33:45.524
A decision's been made.

33:45.607 --> 33:48.360
Please, man. Not her. Not that one, no.
Pick another one.

33:48.569 --> 33:50.237
Crawl back under your stone.

33:51.780 --> 33:52.990
Don't say that.

33:53.323 --> 33:55.409
This woman needs medical assistance.
Come on.

33:55.492 --> 33:59.121
I didn't realize. I forget. I just let myself
run away with myself, you know.

33:59.496 --> 34:00.914
You want a wounded hostage?

34:02.124 --> 34:03.167
- No!
- Back off.

34:03.417 --> 34:04.918
Go see to your friends, Cock.

34:06.295 --> 34:07.254
No.

34:07.337 --> 34:10.841
You wanted a wounded hostage
and now you have one, don't you?

34:11.091 --> 34:13.677
Everybody's happy. Everybody wins.

34:14.344 --> 34:16.138
- You're happy. Yeah?
- Kathryn, it's gonna be okay.

34:16.304 --> 34:17.347
Snow, it's gone bad.

34:17.639 --> 34:19.725
<i>You gotta get in there, man. Get in there.</i>

34:32.529 --> 34:33.989
Kathryn, we're gonna get you home, okay?

34:34.697 --> 34:35.699
Kathryn.

34:35.783 --> 34:38.577
<i>It's a setup.</i>
<i>There's some guy outside climbing on board.</i>

34:38.659 --> 34:41.705
Kathryn, I just need you to breathe with me.

34:42.081 --> 34:43.916
Listen, I was just doing
what I was supposed...

34:45.958 --> 34:47.293
Kathryn.

34:47.710 --> 34:48.795
Kathryn, look at me.

34:48.920 --> 34:51.090
I really... I... Please...

34:51.172 --> 34:53.007
You said I could trust you.

34:53.092 --> 34:55.260
Listen, I was just gonna... Please.

34:58.472 --> 34:59.973
<i>Bring them back inside.</i>

35:02.518 --> 35:04.520
Come on, Emilie, let's go.

35:13.237 --> 35:14.655
Come on now.

35:16.824 --> 35:18.617
Do something useful.

35:19.409 --> 35:21.578
Go find that man and kill him.

35:21.662 --> 35:24.248
I don't wanna see you till it's done.

35:25.999 --> 35:28.544
Why don't we just kill that lunatic?

35:30.295 --> 35:32.297
Because he's my brother.

35:33.382 --> 35:36.885
Okay. Hold on, nearly there. Okay, got it.

35:37.594 --> 35:41.431
You need to look around
and you should see a sealed port.

35:41.723 --> 35:43.308
<i>- You got it?</i>
<i>- Yeah, I see it.</i>

35:43.392 --> 35:46.854
<i>Okay. I need you to pull back</i>
<i>on the small quick release.</i>

35:46.937 --> 35:47.980
<i>Right.</i>

35:53.944 --> 35:55.112
<i>Are you in?</i>

35:55.571 --> 35:56.572
<i>Snow.</i>

35:56.905 --> 35:58.115
Snow?

36:01.451 --> 36:02.703
Snow, can you hear me?

36:10.210 --> 36:11.336
Warnock?

36:17.426 --> 36:18.927
There you are.

37:10.395 --> 37:11.647
Come on.

37:14.524 --> 37:16.485
Wait, wait, wait. This way.

37:31.458 --> 37:34.253
We'll be safe here.
Nothing getting through that.

37:34.670 --> 37:36.421
- So what now?
- We wait.

37:36.922 --> 37:39.841
They're sending the Marines.
It won't be long.

37:40.259 --> 37:41.677
Snow, what's going on?

37:42.761 --> 37:45.722
You know, global warming,

37:46.515 --> 37:48.016
<i>some celebrity is getting a boob-job,</i>

37:48.100 --> 37:50.727
Congress is screwing the pooch again.

37:50.811 --> 37:53.105
- You know, same old.
- Snow.

37:53.272 --> 37:55.983
Come on, man.
I mean, what's going on there?

37:56.191 --> 37:58.110
Oh, yeah. Well,

37:58.193 --> 38:00.487
<i>your wildcat smacked me in the head</i>
<i>with a fire extinguisher</i>

38:00.570 --> 38:01.697
<i>and locked herself in some room.</i>

38:01.863 --> 38:04.283
So she's safe. Send the cavalry.

38:07.744 --> 38:11.456
Listen, Snow. You stick to the plan.
You better do your job

38:11.707 --> 38:14.334
<i>or I'll hit you with a Sherman tank. Got that?</i>

38:14.418 --> 38:16.253
A Sherman tank? Yeah, right.

38:16.336 --> 38:18.505
Toss my caber, Langral.

38:18.588 --> 38:20.882
- I've got other things to do.
- Hey, Snow...

38:44.573 --> 38:48.243
The answer to all our problems
lies behind this door.

38:48.327 --> 38:50.579
Get me a security engineer.

38:52.331 --> 38:53.707
Actually,

38:55.167 --> 38:56.626
bring me two.

39:12.017 --> 39:13.352
Snow, can you hear me?

39:13.643 --> 39:14.644
<i>Snow.</i>

39:15.187 --> 39:16.688
<i>Come on, Snow.</i>

39:17.439 --> 39:18.690
Snow, can you hear me? It's Langral.

39:18.774 --> 39:20.859
<i>I want you to go in and get her. Now.</i>

39:20.942 --> 39:23.445
Actually, that's a little inconvenient
right now.

39:24.529 --> 39:25.781
<i>I don't care.</i>

39:25.947 --> 39:27.783
She's losing oxygen. She's suffocating.

39:28.075 --> 39:29.242
<i>You understand?</i>

39:29.326 --> 39:31.286
- You're making this up, right?
<i>- Snow, it's Harry here.</i>

39:31.370 --> 39:34.831
This is for real.
At the current rate of nitrogen buildup,

39:34.915 --> 39:36.792
she will be dead in... How long?

39:37.459 --> 39:38.460
Five minutes, man.

39:38.627 --> 39:40.462
Yeah. Well, contrary to popular belief,

39:40.545 --> 39:43.715
I'm not actually Houdini and those things
are designed to be impregnable.

39:43.799 --> 39:46.343
So, I'm not sure what you're asking me to do.

39:49.721 --> 39:50.931
You all right?

39:55.018 --> 39:56.019
Yeah.

39:59.064 --> 40:00.065
No.

40:06.988 --> 40:11.660
Hopefully, this will short-circuit me
the inevitable "it can't be done" discussion.

40:12.285 --> 40:14.162
I need this door open.

40:20.085 --> 40:23.004
<i>You should see a ladder in front of you.</i>
<i>Do you see it?</i>

40:23.171 --> 40:24.172
Yeah.

40:24.339 --> 40:25.340
Okay, I need you to take it.

40:29.386 --> 40:32.806
<i>And then, when you're over,</i>
<i>you gotta go straight ahead.</i>

40:40.522 --> 40:43.859
<i>And here's where it gets a little bit tricky.</i>

40:54.369 --> 40:56.872
<i>I need you to get to the other side. Correct?</i>

40:58.081 --> 41:00.375
What do you want me to do, fly?

41:00.709 --> 41:02.294
'Cause I think I left my cape at home.

41:02.544 --> 41:04.504
I need you to listen to this, buddy. Go.

41:04.588 --> 41:07.382
The gravity generated by the torsion system
will hold you up.

41:10.427 --> 41:13.388
<i>You gotta trust me on this.</i>
<i>You should just glide right over.</i>

41:13.472 --> 41:14.473
Really?

41:18.185 --> 41:19.269
<i>Snow?</i>

41:21.771 --> 41:22.898
<i>Snow!</i>

41:27.903 --> 41:29.905
<i>Snow, there is no time for hanging around.</i>

42:02.103 --> 42:03.396
What is that?

42:21.498 --> 42:22.624
All channels.

42:23.166 --> 42:24.167
Snow, can you hear me?

42:28.338 --> 42:29.589
Reactivate the torsion.

42:45.063 --> 42:46.523
What is that?

42:52.362 --> 42:54.531
- They're trying to get it open.
- Can they do that?

42:58.577 --> 43:00.579
This may take a bit longer.

43:01.871 --> 43:03.999
That really is unfortunate.

43:08.128 --> 43:09.671
We're gonna need a new engineer.

43:10.005 --> 43:12.007
This one's sprung a leak.

43:17.178 --> 43:19.431
<i>Okay, so that was easy, right?</i>

43:20.307 --> 43:22.517
<i>Are you at the hatch? Snow?</i>

43:26.646 --> 43:28.732
Your two minutes start now.

43:29.858 --> 43:33.111
Shoot me if you want, but I can guarantee
this open if you give me five minutes.

43:33.194 --> 43:34.863
Good sales pitch.

43:36.656 --> 43:38.366
<i>Oxygen levels depleted.</i>

43:38.450 --> 43:39.659
Oh, God, no.

43:39.743 --> 43:42.037
<i>Please seek medical assistance.</i>

43:43.705 --> 43:45.290
<i>Please seek medical assistance.</i>

43:45.373 --> 43:48.418
Okay, Emilie, listen to me very carefully.

43:48.501 --> 43:51.713
Nitrogen is lighter than oxygen,
so there will be more at floor level.

43:51.796 --> 43:53.923
Breathe shallow but steady.

43:54.049 --> 43:56.051
Keep your heart rate low.

43:59.095 --> 44:00.430
I'm sorry.

44:09.481 --> 44:11.816
Something happened.
Somehow she found more oxygen,

44:12.108 --> 44:13.360
but that will only give us a minute or so.

44:14.569 --> 44:16.321
<i>Snow, you gotta get in there.</i>

44:16.404 --> 44:19.908
<i>EEG activity declining.</i>
<i>Brain death in 20 seconds.</i>

44:20.158 --> 44:21.451
- Twenty seconds.
- Lost him.

44:21.534 --> 44:22.744
Twenty seconds and then this is all over.

44:24.871 --> 44:26.081
Yeah. I should've stayed in college.

44:30.960 --> 44:32.253
Okay.

44:32.921 --> 44:35.256
Hot girl on the floor, big hole in her leg.

44:35.715 --> 44:37.592
Okay, first let's get the motor going.

44:37.676 --> 44:40.470
<i>Open the medi-pack.</i>
<i>You need to get the defib kit.</i>

44:40.553 --> 44:41.554
Fifteen seconds.

44:41.638 --> 44:43.640
You know the counting thing?
It's not very relaxing.

44:43.807 --> 44:46.810
Gel them, place them on the chest,
center under the right arm.

44:47.102 --> 44:48.937
- Make sure they stay on her.
- Ten seconds.

44:49.062 --> 44:50.063
And...

44:52.273 --> 44:53.608
Bingo! Got an induced-pulse.

44:53.858 --> 44:54.984
<i>Seven, six...</i>

44:55.068 --> 44:56.861
- So why is there still counting?
- Not done yet.

44:57.112 --> 44:59.155
<i>Find the Vidadermic labeled "20 ccs."</i>

44:59.280 --> 45:01.324
- Serotonin nor epinephrine.
- What the hell do I do with this?

45:01.783 --> 45:03.201
<i>It's a neurotransmitter stimulant.</i>

45:03.284 --> 45:06.204
You've got to push the needle through
the center of her right eye into the brain.

45:06.371 --> 45:08.289
Come on, you're kidding me, right?

45:08.373 --> 45:10.125
Move it around until it locates the thalamus.

45:10.208 --> 45:12.419
<i>It's self-guiding. Then fire it.</i>

45:12.794 --> 45:13.795
Okay.

45:22.554 --> 45:23.638
I'm gonna be sick.

45:26.558 --> 45:28.309
<i>Okay. We've got some activity.</i>

45:28.852 --> 45:31.521
Yeah, we've got activity all right.
She's doing the lambada in here.

45:31.855 --> 45:33.815
<i>- Get some air in there.</i>
<i>- What, mouth to mouth?</i>

45:33.898 --> 45:35.150
<i>Mouth to mouth.</i>

45:35.567 --> 45:36.943
Here we go.

45:43.491 --> 45:44.492
Hey!

45:44.826 --> 45:46.161
It's okay, it's okay.

45:46.619 --> 45:49.330
- What the hell are you doing?
- I'm bringing you back from the dead.

45:49.664 --> 45:52.959
- I was dead?
- Yeah, and so far I think I prefer you that way.

45:53.501 --> 45:55.837
Come on, that's enough foreplay.
We gotta get out of here.

46:00.675 --> 46:02.677
You! Let's go. Come on.

46:03.261 --> 46:05.013
Back to the kennel!

46:13.313 --> 46:14.314
Shit.

46:23.031 --> 46:24.199
Watch your head.

46:25.033 --> 46:26.034
Take the next left.

46:26.785 --> 46:27.786
Okay, this way.

46:27.869 --> 46:30.121
<i>Then go about 50 feet.</i>

46:30.371 --> 46:32.665
<i>But watch your back, man. Remember Kiev.</i>

46:32.874 --> 46:34.542
Hold it, her BP is dropping.

46:35.001 --> 46:36.169
<i>She's losing too much blood.</i>

46:36.711 --> 46:39.297
<i>Hey, Snow, docs say check Emilie's leg.</i>

46:39.380 --> 46:41.925
Yeah. I'll put it on the to-do list.

46:49.849 --> 46:51.059
You're almost there, buddy.

47:00.360 --> 47:03.279
I understand you're the prison's
communications expert.

47:03.905 --> 47:05.406
I've a job for you.

47:08.409 --> 47:09.410
Bollocks.

47:15.333 --> 47:17.502
<i>Now it is vitally important</i>
<i>that you go the right way.</i>

47:17.585 --> 47:20.672
<i>Whatever you do, for Christ's sake,</i>
<i>don't go down the...</i>

47:20.755 --> 47:22.590
Harry? Harry.

47:22.841 --> 47:24.342
Hey, Snow. Can you hear me?

47:25.051 --> 47:26.135
Shit!

47:27.387 --> 47:28.680
They've cut transmission.

47:28.763 --> 47:30.098
Who did?

47:31.057 --> 47:33.893
The little transmission fairies.
Who do you think?

47:34.102 --> 47:35.937
Greg, what the hell is happening here?

47:36.104 --> 47:38.231
- This way.
- Are you sure?

47:38.439 --> 47:40.191
- Yeah.
- You don't sound sure.

47:40.275 --> 47:41.860
Well, lam.

47:44.571 --> 47:46.489
It's electromagnetic lockout.

47:46.573 --> 47:47.574
Christ.

47:47.824 --> 47:51.786
Find a way to get me back in
because we're flying blind here.

47:55.123 --> 47:57.542
I thought you said you were sure.

47:58.376 --> 48:00.712
You're really a lot of fun, you know that?

48:00.795 --> 48:02.964
Come on, don't worry. It's perfectly safe.

48:12.682 --> 48:14.893
You don't have to do that!

48:14.976 --> 48:16.436
A simple "thank you" is enough.

48:18.396 --> 48:19.772
Asshole.

48:20.857 --> 48:21.983
So,

48:23.610 --> 48:25.278
well, we lost them, huh?

48:27.822 --> 48:28.990
Right.

48:30.241 --> 48:31.409
Sorry.

48:31.659 --> 48:32.660
Up you get.

48:33.453 --> 48:34.829
Thank you.

48:40.877 --> 48:41.878
Yuck.

48:52.931 --> 48:54.349
Who are you?

48:55.975 --> 48:57.435
Who sent you?

48:57.685 --> 48:58.853
Your old man did.

48:59.854 --> 49:01.147
My dad.

49:02.357 --> 49:03.358
What did he say?

49:03.441 --> 49:06.069
Well, I didn't get to meet him personally.
He kind of delegated your rescue.

49:06.319 --> 49:08.237
He had a big conference on the corn surplus.

49:08.321 --> 49:09.322
You're kidding me?

49:09.405 --> 49:11.783
No. No, apparently,
we should all be eating more corn.

49:11.866 --> 49:12.867
About my father.

49:12.951 --> 49:14.577
Oh, yeah, I made that other bit up.

49:14.661 --> 49:17.372
- Did he have a message for me?
- Yes, you are adopted.

49:18.748 --> 49:22.460
Are you the only type of jerk
they found for this kind of mission?

49:22.543 --> 49:23.962
The only one stupid enough to say yes.

49:27.048 --> 49:28.925
So, what's the plan?

49:29.884 --> 49:32.971
Surely you have a plan
to rescue the hostages?

49:33.137 --> 49:36.057
- What hostages?
- The hostages. The staff, the guards.

49:36.349 --> 49:37.684
Should I write it out in crayon?

49:37.850 --> 49:41.145
I came here to rescue you
and mission accomplished.

49:41.229 --> 49:42.814
And quite well, I might add.

49:44.649 --> 49:48.486
Are you just thrilled being yourself all day
or is it a part-time job?

49:48.987 --> 49:51.698
I'm not kidding. We can't just leave them.

49:51.781 --> 49:53.783
- Leave who?
- The hostages!

49:56.077 --> 49:57.996
- What is that?
- That's to stop the bleeding.

49:58.079 --> 49:59.247
And hopefully, the talking.

50:04.877 --> 50:06.754
They will die if we leave them.

50:06.879 --> 50:08.965
Listen, we're not going back to rescue
any hostages, okay?

50:09.048 --> 50:11.342
We're getting out of here,
after I do one thing.

50:11.426 --> 50:12.844
There. That's the plan.

50:13.094 --> 50:14.345
Are you always this obnoxious?

50:18.349 --> 50:19.559
Did you hear something?

50:21.561 --> 50:23.604
No, I'm just enjoying the silence.

50:23.938 --> 50:25.356
You asshole.

50:26.941 --> 50:28.276
We are not leaving them.

50:28.443 --> 50:31.154
Listen, it's really very sweet of you,

50:31.237 --> 50:32.905
but there's not a lot of room
for anybody else, okay?

50:32.989 --> 50:35.491
It's kind of a VIP deal, get it?

50:35.908 --> 50:38.411
What I get is, you're a selfish dick...

50:40.621 --> 50:44.000
That'll freeze the nerves in this spot
for 24 hours.

50:44.083 --> 50:45.084
You want some on your mouth?

50:46.753 --> 50:47.879
No?

50:58.598 --> 51:01.059
- Okay, see here on the map?
- Yeah.

51:01.142 --> 51:02.393
That's where the pod is. You get in it,

51:02.477 --> 51:04.812
you fly away and the good guys will come
and get you. Okay?

51:04.937 --> 51:06.147
On my own?

51:06.230 --> 51:07.648
You're a big girl, right?

51:07.732 --> 51:09.150
Here's an apple. And a gun.

51:09.233 --> 51:11.861
Don't talk to strangers. Shoot them.

51:14.113 --> 51:15.990
This is the plan you agreed on
with my father?

51:16.074 --> 51:18.117
Yeah, he said it'll toughen you up.
Apparently, you need that.

51:18.534 --> 51:20.328
Well, I'm sure I'll be

51:21.996 --> 51:23.289
fine. Where are you going?

51:23.456 --> 51:25.333
I've got a hot date.

51:25.416 --> 51:28.753
It's been a real slice, so good luck.
And good luck with the leg thing.

51:29.837 --> 51:31.005
Okay.

51:38.346 --> 51:39.347
Okay, the map.

51:39.514 --> 51:42.308
You gotta flip it. It's upside down.

51:42.433 --> 51:44.435
No, no. So you can see the screen.

51:45.978 --> 51:47.063
Which way's north?

51:47.188 --> 51:51.609
Okay, we're in space now.
So it's not north, it's port and starboard.

51:53.361 --> 51:54.529
Thanks.

52:02.036 --> 52:03.496
You're doing great.

52:04.038 --> 52:05.498
<i>Can I have your attention?</i>

52:05.873 --> 52:08.918
<i>You want to get out of here?</i>
<i>Our meal ticket is a woman.</i>

52:09.043 --> 52:11.504
<i>And she's been on the run</i>
<i>for some time now.</i>

52:11.712 --> 52:12.713
<i>We need her alive</i>

52:13.840 --> 52:15.716
<i>and we need her as soon as possible.</i>

52:15.883 --> 52:18.803
<i>Now, they're going to try</i>
<i>and leave the station.</i>

52:20.638 --> 52:22.265
<i>Watch everywhere.</i>

52:23.391 --> 52:26.602
Yeah, okay, you can tag along,
but maybe don't talk.

52:26.686 --> 52:28.437
Just keep it zipped.

52:28.980 --> 52:30.606
Here, give me the map.

52:32.108 --> 52:33.901
Okay, we go this way.

52:36.195 --> 52:37.363
North.

52:40.700 --> 52:41.909
<i>Smiler!</i>

52:42.827 --> 52:43.911
<i>Are you there?</i>

52:43.995 --> 52:46.747
<i>Sweetheart, I miss you. Smiler!</i>

52:46.831 --> 52:48.249
Hey, why do they do that?

52:48.332 --> 52:49.333
Do what?

52:49.417 --> 52:50.418
The marking on the face.

52:50.501 --> 52:52.795
Other prisoners do it to them.
Lets everyone know you're a rat.

52:52.879 --> 52:54.630
Here, put these on.

52:55.840 --> 52:57.675
- No.
- They don't come in pink.

52:58.551 --> 53:01.137
You can't walk past 500 whack jobs
dressed like a chick.

53:01.387 --> 53:03.723
Oh, so this is part of your plan.

53:04.223 --> 53:06.517
So kind of you to clue me in.

53:06.684 --> 53:08.352
You can't smoke in here.

53:09.145 --> 53:10.396
All evidence to the contrary.

53:14.942 --> 53:16.360
So...

53:16.444 --> 53:17.695
So, what do I call you?

53:18.321 --> 53:20.740
You know what? Don't call me.

53:23.409 --> 53:25.453
- What's your name?
- Snow.

53:25.953 --> 53:27.121
- Snow?
- Yeah.

53:27.288 --> 53:29.040
Or Sir. You can decide.

53:29.123 --> 53:30.166
What's your first name?

53:31.459 --> 53:32.418
Snow.

53:32.501 --> 53:34.837
Your name is Snow Snow?

53:34.921 --> 53:37.381
Well, that's just ridiculous.

53:37.465 --> 53:39.717
- Why won't you tell me your name?
- I just did.

53:39.800 --> 53:41.302
No, you didn't.

53:42.386 --> 53:43.387
What is that?

53:47.808 --> 53:50.519
Engine oil, coffee,
some water I just got out of the toilet.

53:50.770 --> 53:52.647
And just what do you plan on doing with it?

53:52.813 --> 53:55.316
I plan on putting it in your hair.

53:56.817 --> 54:00.863
If you would like to play witness protection
and shampoo in toilet water,

54:00.947 --> 54:02.865
be my guest. Not me.

54:04.325 --> 54:05.868
Come on. It'll be fun.

54:06.827 --> 54:07.870
Not on your life.

54:08.788 --> 54:10.581
God, stop!

54:12.333 --> 54:13.668
it stinks!

54:15.711 --> 54:17.004
- Enough!
- There you go.

54:18.923 --> 54:20.675
Wasn't that fun?

54:21.384 --> 54:23.344
- You're a pig.
- Thank you.

54:27.056 --> 54:28.683
You always treat women this way?

54:28.766 --> 54:31.269
Always. Well, only if I like them.

54:31.352 --> 54:33.604
You have any idea
what my father would do to you?

54:33.938 --> 54:36.774
Jeez! Not raise taxes again?

54:36.857 --> 54:37.858
Here.

54:39.944 --> 54:41.779
Yeah, you look good.

54:42.363 --> 54:43.823
Though, something's missing.

54:44.782 --> 54:45.783
What?

54:47.326 --> 54:50.538
It's okay, it's okay. It's only cosmetic.
It's only cosmetic. It's nothing personal.

54:50.621 --> 54:53.833
Here, look, look. It'll probably save your life.

54:53.916 --> 54:56.168
You look tough now, see?

55:02.883 --> 55:05.469
You really are a naughty boy, Special Agent.

55:06.053 --> 55:07.346
<i>What, you thought we wouldn't find out?</i>

55:07.638 --> 55:09.307
Don't know what you're talking about.

55:09.390 --> 55:12.310
You tell Warnock that we have his daughter.

55:12.643 --> 55:14.437
<i>And unless we get what we want,</i>

55:14.937 --> 55:19.775
you tell your boss
that I've got 500 pent-up convicts

55:20.234 --> 55:24.113
<i>all too eager to educate his little girl.</i>

55:24.530 --> 55:25.656
Okay.

55:26.282 --> 55:27.908
What do you want?

55:47.011 --> 55:48.429
What's happened?

55:48.512 --> 55:50.014
Is Emilie okay?

55:56.812 --> 55:58.773
What's going on here, man?

55:58.939 --> 56:01.817
What's it look like?
We're going on a hunting trip.

56:03.152 --> 56:06.113
You're going to get her?
I mean, let me come.

56:06.447 --> 56:08.324
- No.
- Don't leave me behind, man.

56:08.407 --> 56:09.617
What am I gonna do here?

56:09.867 --> 56:10.910
Nothing.

56:11.494 --> 56:15.039
And don't do anything stupid when I'm gone.
All right?

56:22.380 --> 56:25.758
Okay. This is Main Containment,
so don't draw attention to yourself.

56:27.134 --> 56:28.594
And what if this doesn't work?

56:28.677 --> 56:30.137
Well, then we're probably gonna die.

56:30.262 --> 56:31.555
Is that your idea of encouragement?

56:31.639 --> 56:34.975
What can I say? I'm sorry it's not one
of your fancy presidential society functions.

56:35.101 --> 56:36.811
Where do you get these ideas about me?

56:36.894 --> 56:40.189
I don't know. You know, you just don't
seem like the kind of girl who'd go bowling.

56:40.314 --> 56:43.484
Excuse me? Bowling?
I happen to be great at bowling.

56:43.651 --> 56:45.569
Really? You go bowling?

56:45.736 --> 56:48.239
Yeah. Every Tuesday.
There's a lane at the White House.

56:49.949 --> 56:51.992
Yeah. That's what I'm talking about.

56:52.243 --> 56:53.369
That is hardly my fault.

56:53.494 --> 56:55.454
Careful,
you're starting to sound like your old man.

56:55.830 --> 56:58.040
Here. Not even loaded.

57:08.467 --> 57:10.845
Dude, you're a dude, okay?

57:15.933 --> 57:19.103
Hey, you! Yeah, you.

57:19.520 --> 57:21.313
You know who we're talking to.

57:30.281 --> 57:31.282
What are you looking for?

57:31.532 --> 57:32.575
Mace.

57:32.908 --> 57:34.034
Like the spray?

57:35.077 --> 57:37.079
No, not like the spray.

57:57.183 --> 57:58.309
Mace!

57:59.727 --> 58:01.061
Shit!

58:02.271 --> 58:03.898
Can I help you?

58:07.318 --> 58:09.570
No. Well, you could get out of the way.

58:10.070 --> 58:11.238
No problem.

58:13.324 --> 58:15.618
Just give me the password.

58:15.743 --> 58:16.827
Yeah.

58:16.911 --> 58:18.412
I like your pretty boy buddy.

58:21.415 --> 58:22.541
Does he like to party?

58:23.000 --> 58:25.503
Yeah. Like it's 1999.

58:25.753 --> 58:26.879
Don't you?

58:28.923 --> 58:30.424
You don't know the password.

58:31.300 --> 58:33.385
Then there's a penalty.

58:36.263 --> 58:37.264
Get them!

58:46.941 --> 58:48.692
The door's jammed!

58:48.776 --> 58:49.985
Here, shoot them, will you?

58:55.407 --> 58:56.742
Jesus, I thought you were a Democrat.

59:05.084 --> 59:07.002
Mace! Come on.

59:12.758 --> 59:14.843
Mace! You son of a bitch.

59:14.927 --> 59:16.303
You Okay?

59:17.346 --> 59:18.556
Okay. Okay.

59:18.847 --> 59:20.808
Bitch, son of a bitch.

59:21.642 --> 59:22.643
What the hell's wrong with you, buddy?

59:22.726 --> 59:24.812
Buddy? Buddy, YOU-

59:24.895 --> 59:26.981
Buddy, you be. No.

59:27.064 --> 59:29.066
No. Not to be. No. Wrong!

59:29.149 --> 59:30.150
What's going on, man?

59:32.236 --> 59:34.238
I know what this is. It's dementia.

59:34.405 --> 59:36.365
Come on, he's like 35.

59:36.448 --> 59:37.658
It's from the stasis.

59:37.866 --> 59:39.368
Some people just unravel.

59:39.451 --> 59:40.619
Gravel.

59:43.205 --> 59:46.166
- So, it is true.
- True, true, true, true.

59:46.834 --> 59:48.711
True blue. Union stew.

59:48.877 --> 59:50.337
To do or not to do. Right?

59:50.421 --> 59:51.422
No, wrong.

59:51.505 --> 59:55.175
Wrong. Lullaby, lullaby, lullaby, lullaby...

59:57.261 --> 59:58.512
Shit.

01:00:06.854 --> 01:00:08.564
I need you to get me something.

01:00:08.689 --> 01:00:10.941
Now you're asking a crazy man
where he hid a briefcase

01:00:11.025 --> 01:00:12.568
that you threw away
in a crowded subway station?

01:00:12.651 --> 01:00:15.696
Mace? Remember the case? The package?

01:00:15.779 --> 01:00:17.573
In the train station.
I threw it to you on the train.

01:00:17.656 --> 01:00:19.199
Where'd you put it?

01:00:19.283 --> 01:00:20.367
Right.

01:00:20.868 --> 01:00:22.870
Yeah, no, I put it...

01:00:25.039 --> 01:00:26.165
Yeah?

01:00:27.791 --> 01:00:28.959
In my pants.

01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:34.006
- In your pants?
- Yeah. Sister Mary said it was bad

01:00:34.089 --> 01:00:36.967
to take it out in church
in front of the other kids.

01:00:37.051 --> 01:00:41.138
When you do bad things, the angels,
they cry. That's what Sister Mary says.

01:00:41.221 --> 01:00:45.100
It's a disruption in his cortical circuitry.
It's why I'm here.

01:00:45.225 --> 01:00:47.561
It's just bad news. That's what it is.

01:00:50.105 --> 01:00:51.857
Come on, buddy. Let's go.

01:00:52.107 --> 01:00:53.692
Wait a minute. Why are you bringing him?

01:00:54.068 --> 01:00:56.153
- He's one of them. He's safer without us.
- I need him.

01:00:56.236 --> 01:00:57.529
For what? This phantom briefcase?

01:00:57.613 --> 01:00:59.865
You'd be lucky to get a recipe
for mud pies out of this guy.

01:00:59.948 --> 01:01:02.743
He's coming with us, okay? End of story.

01:01:04.703 --> 01:01:06.246
I know exactly what I'm doing.

01:01:12.586 --> 01:01:14.505
Don't let them get away!

01:01:16.090 --> 01:01:17.633
Come on. God damn it!

01:01:17.925 --> 01:01:19.885
Get them! Over here!

01:01:19.968 --> 01:01:21.345
Okay, this way! This way!

01:01:21.428 --> 01:01:22.429
Come on.

01:01:23.389 --> 01:01:25.182
- Put a light down there.
- Gotta go.

01:01:25.265 --> 01:01:26.392
GO, go:

01:01:26.558 --> 01:01:27.810
Gotta go!

01:01:30.437 --> 01:01:32.398
- Go, go.
- Go, go. Okay. Go.

01:01:50.124 --> 01:01:51.125
Porn horn.

01:02:13.147 --> 01:02:14.732
Okay, come on.

01:02:25.492 --> 01:02:26.493
Man.

01:02:28.996 --> 01:02:31.498
- Oh, God!
- Come on, Mace! Mace!

01:02:32.166 --> 01:02:33.125
Hit the panic button!

01:02:33.208 --> 01:02:34.960
- Come on, buddy. Hit the panic button.
- Button, button. Mutton.

01:02:35.335 --> 01:02:36.670
The button. Hit the panic button.

01:02:37.004 --> 01:02:38.839
- Hit the panic button, Mace. Come on!
- Button.

01:02:39.214 --> 01:02:40.591
Son of a bitch.

01:02:40.674 --> 01:02:41.759
Button.

01:02:42.301 --> 01:02:43.969
Son of a bitch.

01:02:47.681 --> 01:02:49.600
Shit! Hold on, buddy. Wait there!

01:02:49.683 --> 01:02:51.518
Oh, dear. Locked.

01:02:51.602 --> 01:02:53.896
Lock. Locker. Locker.

01:02:54.354 --> 01:02:56.148
Green. Beans. Locker.

01:02:56.231 --> 01:02:57.691
Mace. Mace.

01:02:57.900 --> 01:02:59.151
Mace.

01:02:59.526 --> 01:03:00.611
Mace. Case.

01:03:00.778 --> 01:03:02.780
Chase. Lullaby.

01:03:03.864 --> 01:03:05.282
Mace, case.

01:03:06.033 --> 01:03:07.743
I foresee you.

01:03:07.910 --> 01:03:09.286
- I see you.
- What?

01:03:10.788 --> 01:03:12.664
I see you.

01:03:13.540 --> 01:03:16.335
I foresee you. Lullaby.

01:03:16.418 --> 01:03:19.963
- I foresee you.
- Hold on, buddy. Come on.

01:03:22.174 --> 01:03:23.425
Come on.

01:03:34.311 --> 01:03:35.896
God damn it!

01:03:53.330 --> 01:03:55.749
If you want something done...

01:03:58.585 --> 01:04:01.088
We need a change of plan 'round here.

01:04:05.384 --> 01:04:07.427
Well, that's that then.

01:04:13.517 --> 01:04:14.601
I'm sorry.

01:04:14.685 --> 01:04:16.478
Yeah, right. I'm sure you are.

01:04:18.272 --> 01:04:19.314
I know he was your friend.

01:04:19.565 --> 01:04:21.149
I don't need your sympathy, okay?
Neither does he.

01:04:21.692 --> 01:04:22.776
No.

01:04:23.819 --> 01:04:25.737
No, he needed a friend
who wouldn't hang him out to dry.

01:04:25.821 --> 01:04:28.699
Yeah, I'm taking the rap for something
I didn't do, okay? I didn't put him here.

01:04:30.117 --> 01:04:34.121
Who cares? People die all the time.
It's no big deal.

01:04:34.204 --> 01:04:36.456
How many people have died for you
since you got here?

01:04:36.540 --> 01:04:39.793
But you're the President's daughter,
so you're worth it, right?

01:04:40.294 --> 01:04:42.337
Looks like your little PR trip
got all screwed up.

01:04:42.421 --> 01:04:46.550
I came here to ensure that people were being
treated fairly and decently, unlike yourself.

01:04:46.633 --> 01:04:50.012
You know, it's easy to be a saint
with nothing on the line.

01:04:50.095 --> 01:04:51.680
You wait till you've got a serious sacrifice
to make

01:04:51.763 --> 01:04:54.766
and then you'll find out who you really are.

01:04:55.976 --> 01:04:57.185
Most people run for cover.

01:04:57.352 --> 01:04:59.229
But not you, right?

01:04:59.313 --> 01:05:00.731
- No.
- No.

01:05:00.814 --> 01:05:03.108
You just sacrifice your friends.

01:05:14.703 --> 01:05:15.787
<i>Sorry, hold on.</i>

01:05:16.079 --> 01:05:20.500
You're saying that the International
Space Station ran into M.S. One?

01:05:20.667 --> 01:05:22.377
No, I'm saying the opposite.

01:05:22.461 --> 01:05:25.130
M.S. One
ran into the International Space Station.

01:05:25.255 --> 01:05:26.673
I thought it was locked in orbit.

01:05:26.840 --> 01:05:29.885
It was controlled by a geo-orbital technician.

01:05:29.968 --> 01:05:31.553
And where is this technician?

01:05:31.803 --> 01:05:32.930
They blew him out an airlock.

01:05:33.013 --> 01:05:36.600
Look, M.S. One is essentially
a big fly-by-wire system.

01:05:36.934 --> 01:05:40.228
Without constant monitoring,
it's basically falling out of the sky.

01:05:40.896 --> 01:05:41.897
What's the bottom line?

01:05:42.648 --> 01:05:44.232
- Best guess?
- Please.

01:05:44.316 --> 01:05:46.777
Impact with the Eastern Seaboard
in eight hours.

01:05:49.655 --> 01:05:53.158
Can you get me a secure line
to Jack Tallis at Justice?

01:05:59.456 --> 01:06:00.832
Bingo.

01:06:00.916 --> 01:06:02.793
It's a rescue mission!

01:06:05.504 --> 01:06:07.673
That's not a rescue mission.

01:06:08.674 --> 01:06:09.925
Come on.

01:06:17.557 --> 01:06:19.685
I thought you said there were two seats.

01:06:19.768 --> 01:06:22.312
No, two pods! You take this one
and I'll jump in the other one.

01:06:22.396 --> 01:06:24.106
- Where's the other one?
- We don't have time for this, okay?

01:06:24.189 --> 01:06:25.565
Just get in.

01:06:30.028 --> 01:06:33.031
- You are going in the other pod, right?
- I'll be right behind you, don't worry.

01:06:33.115 --> 01:06:34.491
Promise me.

01:06:35.909 --> 01:06:37.536
Yeah, okay, I promise.

01:06:47.337 --> 01:06:48.588
What is your first name?

01:06:49.881 --> 01:06:52.259
I'll tell you when we get there.
I'll race you down.

01:06:52.551 --> 01:06:54.594
I'll buy you an ice cream.

01:07:17.451 --> 01:07:19.911
Sir? We have pod launch on M.S. One.

01:07:20.954 --> 01:07:24.124
What do you know!
Your deadbeat friend did it.

01:07:31.131 --> 01:07:33.133
This your idea of keeping a promise?

01:07:33.216 --> 01:07:35.052
What the hell is wrong with you?
Why'd you get out of the pod?

01:07:35.135 --> 01:07:37.429
I realized I might be the only thing
keeping the hostages alive.

01:07:37.721 --> 01:07:39.347
Really? How do you figure that?

01:07:39.598 --> 01:07:42.267
My father won't authorize an attack
with me still here.

01:07:42.350 --> 01:07:43.852
Have you actually met your father?

01:07:43.935 --> 01:07:47.064
- Don't start that. We have to help them.
- Look, i can't, okay?

01:07:47.147 --> 01:07:49.649
I would love to, but I can't.

01:07:51.318 --> 01:07:53.653
Mace told me where the case is.

01:07:56.740 --> 01:07:58.992
- Bullshit.
- It was the last thing he said.

01:08:03.413 --> 01:08:04.581
Really?

01:08:05.916 --> 01:08:06.917
So where is it?

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:08.710
You help me, I help you.

01:08:08.794 --> 01:08:10.087
Come on!

01:08:10.170 --> 01:08:12.631
Or are you all mouth, no trousers?

01:08:16.510 --> 01:08:19.011
Fine. You'll believe what you want.

01:08:19.261 --> 01:08:23.517
I wasn't going to tell you, but your
standards of sainthood crap won me over.

01:08:28.313 --> 01:08:29.939
Okay, wait. Wait.

01:08:32.274 --> 01:08:33.819
I'm a lot of trousers, okay?

01:08:34.861 --> 01:08:35.987
<i>Smiler!</i>

01:08:36.154 --> 01:08:37.363
There's been a change of plan.

01:08:37.948 --> 01:08:40.617
<i>We're going to have</i>
<i>a sing-song instead. Okay?</i>

01:08:40.700 --> 01:08:41.993
<i>All right, then.</i>

01:08:42.077 --> 01:08:43.286
<i>Come back to me</i>

01:08:43.370 --> 01:08:46.206
<i>My sweet, my little Emilie</i>

01:08:46.372 --> 01:08:47.374
God.

01:08:47.499 --> 01:08:49.709
I've not told you the plan, man.
I didn't tell you the plan.

01:08:50.544 --> 01:08:53.171
<i>For every three seconds you're not here,</i>
<i>I'm gonna kill a man.</i>

01:08:53.255 --> 01:08:54.464
<i>Do you understand me now?</i>

01:08:54.548 --> 01:08:55.549
<i>So...</i>

01:08:55.631 --> 01:08:59.426
<i>Come back to me, my sweet, my little Emilie</i>

01:08:59.719 --> 01:09:00.929
<i>Where have you gone?</i>

01:09:01.680 --> 01:09:02.889
<i>- Stop!</i>
<i>- Tell me where you are</i>

01:09:02.973 --> 01:09:03.974
<i>or I kill another one.</i>

01:09:04.057 --> 01:09:05.058
- Please stop!
- Emilie.

01:09:05.142 --> 01:09:07.435
<i>Hello, sweetheart.</i>
<i>I can hear you're upset there.</i>

01:09:07.519 --> 01:09:10.104
<i>I'm bloody upset as well.</i>
<i>I'm sweating like a pig here.</i>

01:09:10.313 --> 01:09:12.107
Just stop. I'll do anything you want.

01:09:12.189 --> 01:09:14.109
<i>Well, now, you're being silly.</i>

01:09:14.192 --> 01:09:16.611
<i>I think you're being silly now.</i>
<i>Let me come and get you.</i>

01:09:16.778 --> 01:09:18.822
<i>Tell me where you are and don't lie. Ever.</i>

01:09:20.031 --> 01:09:21.908
Emilie, don't.

01:09:25.620 --> 01:09:26.955
Stop killing people.

01:09:27.037 --> 01:09:30.876
<i>You tell me the truth now</i>
<i>and I'll stop shooting your friends. Okay?</i>

01:09:32.711 --> 01:09:33.920
Level three.

01:09:34.212 --> 01:09:35.589
<i>Thank you.</i>

01:09:37.756 --> 01:09:39.551
No! God!

01:09:40.135 --> 01:09:41.219
No!

01:09:42.970 --> 01:09:44.723
Is anybody hiding?

01:09:44.805 --> 01:09:46.725
'Cause I'll find you!

01:09:49.769 --> 01:09:50.770
<i>It's left.</i>

01:10:08.788 --> 01:10:10.457
He was gonna kill them all anyway.

01:10:10.749 --> 01:10:12.667
I don't really know where the case is.

01:10:16.379 --> 01:10:18.256
I just needed you to help me.

01:10:46.159 --> 01:10:47.494
Okay.

01:11:19.818 --> 01:11:20.986
Yeah.

01:11:23.196 --> 01:11:25.115
This is what I was afraid of.

01:11:25.198 --> 01:11:27.200
They've been using the prisoners
as guinea pigs.

01:11:27.284 --> 01:11:29.995
Yeah, looks like your hostage buddies
are not exactly the innocent victims

01:11:30.078 --> 01:11:31.371
you thought they were, huh?

01:11:31.538 --> 01:11:34.124
Liars everywhere these days it seems.

01:11:35.542 --> 01:11:36.918
Don't move.

01:11:37.627 --> 01:11:39.129
God, I hate that.

01:11:42.549 --> 01:11:43.800
Hello, you two.

01:12:29.012 --> 01:12:30.221
Do you know what you've done?

01:12:36.186 --> 01:12:37.437
Turn on the comms.

01:12:42.275 --> 01:12:44.277
Sir, comms are live.

01:12:45.111 --> 01:12:46.112
All channels.

01:12:46.446 --> 01:12:49.366
Snowfall? This is Home fire.

01:12:49.449 --> 01:12:50.784
<i>Come in.</i>

01:12:53.411 --> 01:12:55.997
<i>Snowfall, this is Home fire.</i>

01:12:56.081 --> 01:12:57.290
<i>Come in.</i>

01:12:57.874 --> 01:12:59.459
Can we make this a secure channel, please?

01:13:00.377 --> 01:13:03.254
- Snow? Snow, are you there?
- Harry, is that you?

01:13:03.588 --> 01:13:07.467
Yeah, man. Live and direct.
For one night only. You?

01:13:07.759 --> 01:13:10.053
Yeah. Put me on the guest list.

01:13:11.429 --> 01:13:14.057
<i>Did we manage to make contact</i>
<i>with our friend?</i>

01:13:14.140 --> 01:13:15.308
Affirmative.

01:13:15.850 --> 01:13:17.268
And what about the thing that you lost?

01:13:17.936 --> 01:13:20.480
- Did our friend come through for us?
- Negative, Harry.

01:13:21.398 --> 01:13:25.235
Okay, don't sweat it. Look,
things have kind of gone sideways here.

01:13:25.318 --> 01:13:27.570
<i>- You gotta get out.</i>
<i>- I didn't get the girl.</i>

01:13:27.654 --> 01:13:29.489
<i>- Ain't that the story of your life?</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

01:13:29.614 --> 01:13:32.283
<i>From what I'm reading on her vitals here,</i>
<i>it don't look good.</i>

01:13:32.492 --> 01:13:35.328
There's no way for you to get back to her
even if she's not already dead.

01:13:35.620 --> 01:13:38.415
<i>M. S. One is falling out of the sky, Snow.</i>
<i>You gotta get out.</i>

01:13:38.498 --> 01:13:40.208
<i>- Okay.</i>
<i>- Get to dock 9.</i>

01:13:40.291 --> 01:13:42.293
<i>There's an ORAM engineering suit there.</i>

01:13:42.377 --> 01:13:44.003
<i>Put it on and get outside.</i>

01:13:44.212 --> 01:13:45.296
You'll need to float around a bit,

01:13:45.380 --> 01:13:47.924
but I'm sending someone by to pick you up.
Okay?

01:13:48.007 --> 01:13:49.551
I think I'm just gonna lie here for a while,

01:13:49.884 --> 01:13:51.970
<i>- and see if it all goes away.</i>
<i>- No.</i>

01:13:53.930 --> 01:13:54.931
All right.

01:13:59.978 --> 01:14:02.021
The M.S. One is destabilized.

01:14:02.522 --> 01:14:05.525
<i>Let us on board, or we'll be forced to attack.</i>

01:14:12.323 --> 01:14:14.367
Now. You want to save your skin?

01:14:16.244 --> 01:14:19.038
Tell your daddy to call off the assault.

01:14:20.999 --> 01:14:23.668
Or I will set my brother onto you.

01:14:41.519 --> 01:14:42.812
<i>Dad?</i>

01:14:45.231 --> 01:14:46.733
<i>Emilie, I'm here.</i>

01:14:47.734 --> 01:14:48.735
<i>Emilie?</i>

01:14:49.235 --> 01:14:50.236
Are you okay?

01:14:50.987 --> 01:14:52.572
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

01:14:54.782 --> 01:14:56.201
<i>Sweetheart?</i>

01:14:56.493 --> 01:14:58.161
Everyone's dead.

01:15:02.540 --> 01:15:04.751
Blow this dump out of the sky.

01:15:07.545 --> 01:15:08.796
Well, shit.

01:15:18.848 --> 01:15:19.933
You get them back.

01:15:20.600 --> 01:15:22.310
You hear me? You call them off!

01:15:22.393 --> 01:15:24.854
Promises are promises, Smiler!

01:15:27.273 --> 01:15:28.274
So be it.

01:15:37.617 --> 01:15:38.952
Promises, sweetheart.

01:15:39.994 --> 01:15:41.496
Leave her be.

01:15:43.623 --> 01:15:45.250
That's it, then.

01:15:46.292 --> 01:15:47.293
Sir,

01:15:48.503 --> 01:15:50.255
you need to authorize an assault.

01:15:50.463 --> 01:15:51.881
Emilie's still on the station.

01:15:52.131 --> 01:15:56.302
I know this might be difficult, sir,
but she's just one hostage.

01:15:56.469 --> 01:15:58.096
She is my daughter.

01:15:58.304 --> 01:15:59.389
I know that, sir.

01:15:59.472 --> 01:16:01.224
Then you know that I cannot authorize that.

01:16:01.474 --> 01:16:02.642
Then I'm sorry, Jeff.

01:16:03.309 --> 01:16:04.727
Sorry?

01:16:04.811 --> 01:16:07.564
Under Section 4 of the 25th Amendment,

01:16:07.647 --> 01:16:10.900
I am temporarily relieving you
of all your duties as the President

01:16:10.984 --> 01:16:14.195
of the United States
due to the fact that you are incapable

01:16:14.362 --> 01:16:17.824
of placing national security
above personal concerns.

01:16:17.907 --> 01:16:21.828
You can't do that. You need vice-presidential
and congressional approval.

01:16:21.911 --> 01:16:23.454
Already signed.

01:16:25.748 --> 01:16:26.833
You son of a bitch!

01:16:27.041 --> 01:16:28.543
Thank you, sir.

01:16:29.127 --> 01:16:31.170
Scott! Please.

01:16:33.673 --> 01:16:35.842
Don't do this.

01:16:35.925 --> 01:16:37.510
You'll kill her.

01:16:39.095 --> 01:16:41.055
Go. Full breach.

01:16:41.139 --> 01:16:43.057
Quarterback? This is Home fire.

01:16:43.141 --> 01:16:45.685
Dropkick authorized. Full breach.

01:16:55.486 --> 01:16:58.323
<i>Moving into assault formation. Weapons live.</i>

01:17:03.036 --> 01:17:04.829
Oh, shit!

01:17:05.413 --> 01:17:07.206
You said that was your promise to me!

01:17:07.332 --> 01:17:08.708
Quiet, we can salvage this.

01:17:08.875 --> 01:17:09.959
Shut up for a second!

01:17:10.043 --> 01:17:12.211
- You said that was a promise to me, man.
- Not now.

01:17:12.295 --> 01:17:14.505
You choose him over me.
You leave me behind.

01:17:14.589 --> 01:17:17.175
We've a serious problem
and you're shouting about this?

01:17:17.467 --> 01:17:18.926
You made me look stupid.

01:17:19.010 --> 01:17:21.137
Every time I dig us out...

01:17:30.480 --> 01:17:32.690
Mommy said you speak too much.

01:17:33.066 --> 01:17:35.360
Who's gonna look after you now?

01:17:39.405 --> 01:17:40.698
Families!

01:17:42.325 --> 01:17:43.868
Hey, now then, where were we, Smiler?

01:17:49.540 --> 01:17:51.876
<i>Target will be throwing live rounds.</i>

01:17:52.669 --> 01:17:55.880
<i>Watch out, the defense system is still active.</i>

01:18:01.511 --> 01:18:02.762
<i>Okay, here we go.</i>

01:18:04.013 --> 01:18:05.848
<i>Number 5, do you read me?</i>

01:18:11.562 --> 01:18:12.563
<i>We're taking fire. We're taking fire.</i>

01:18:18.194 --> 01:18:19.612
Come here. Come here!

01:18:26.994 --> 01:18:27.995
Bitch!

01:18:41.801 --> 01:18:42.802
You're back.

01:18:43.469 --> 01:18:45.471
Yeah, well, I wasn't busy.

01:18:46.973 --> 01:18:48.057
We should go.

01:18:52.895 --> 01:18:55.398
<i>All right,</i>
<i>you need to move down 4.5 degrees.</i>

01:18:57.024 --> 01:18:58.818
<i>6 o'clock, all units, 6 o'clock.</i>

01:18:59.819 --> 01:19:00.862
<i>Coming in low.</i>

01:19:14.500 --> 01:19:16.252
<i>Units two and three, I'm at your left.</i>

01:19:16.502 --> 01:19:19.005
<i>Units two and three, 9 o'clock, 9 o'clock.</i>

01:19:21.340 --> 01:19:24.218
<i>Taking fire, taking fire, unit 11, taking fire.</i>

01:19:24.302 --> 01:19:25.303
Second bomber down.

01:19:25.636 --> 01:19:27.096
<i>We got one more to go.</i>

01:19:27.764 --> 01:19:30.016
<i>Unit nine. We're on our way.</i>

01:19:30.767 --> 01:19:32.226
<i>Unit nine, unit nine.</i>

01:19:35.980 --> 01:19:37.440
<i>We're going in, unit 11.</i>

01:19:38.524 --> 01:19:39.859
<i>Go for the tunnel.</i>

01:19:40.568 --> 01:19:41.944
<i>Unit 17, he's on your tail.</i>

01:19:42.278 --> 01:19:43.362
<i>Turn, turn!</i>

01:19:43.529 --> 01:19:44.906
<i>We have you going for the hole, gentlemen.</i>

01:19:47.241 --> 01:19:48.284
Take a right!

01:19:57.877 --> 01:19:59.378
Okay. Now put that thing on.

01:20:00.046 --> 01:20:01.881
<i>Fifty feet ahead, then right. Almost there.</i>

01:20:01.964 --> 01:20:04.050
<i>- Unit eight, 50 feet!</i>
<i>- Under the gun!</i>

01:20:04.133 --> 01:20:05.802
<i>Twenty-yard line! Drop the baby.</i>

01:20:06.219 --> 01:20:08.513
<i>Baby dropped. Confirming, confirming.</i>

01:20:08.763 --> 01:20:10.431
<i>Touchdown! Let's go!</i>

01:20:10.598 --> 01:20:13.267
<i>All units evac. All units evac.</i>

01:20:26.405 --> 01:20:27.907
Snow, every second counts here, man.

01:20:28.241 --> 01:20:29.575
<i>Get outside.</i>

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.127
I gotta tell you something.

01:20:40.920 --> 01:20:42.880
I really hate heights.

01:21:07.113 --> 01:21:08.197
Emilie!

01:21:13.995 --> 01:21:15.246
Emilie!

01:21:56.412 --> 01:21:59.248
Emilie. Come on. Emilie.

01:22:06.172 --> 01:22:07.632
Come on, buddy. Get up!

01:22:07.715 --> 01:22:08.883
- Okay.
- Let's go.

01:23:11.570 --> 01:23:13.322
The briefcase. The train station.

01:23:13.406 --> 01:23:14.407
I threw you the case.

01:23:16.534 --> 01:23:17.576
Where'd you put it?

01:23:18.619 --> 01:23:21.706
<i>Where'd you put it? Mace?</i>
<i>You remember the package?</i>

01:23:25.292 --> 01:23:26.293
<i>...In the train station.</i>

01:23:26.711 --> 01:23:28.796
<i>True blue, Union... Union...</i>

01:23:29.463 --> 01:23:31.424
<i>True blue, Union... No.</i>

01:23:33.509 --> 01:23:35.219
<i>True blue. Union stew.</i>

01:23:36.721 --> 01:23:38.097
Some people just unravel.

01:23:39.098 --> 01:23:41.726
<i>Now you're asking a crazy man</i>
<i>where he hid a briefcase.</i>

01:23:41.809 --> 01:23:43.269
<i>Green. Beans.</i>

01:23:43.769 --> 01:23:45.646
<i>- Mace?</i>
- Lock, lockers, locker.

01:23:46.105 --> 01:23:48.065
<i>Green. Green gloppy, stocker, stocker.</i>

01:23:48.149 --> 01:23:49.900
- Mace. Mace.
- Yeah.

01:23:49.984 --> 01:23:50.985
<i>Remember the case?</i>

01:23:51.193 --> 01:23:53.154
<i>Where'd you put it?</i>
<i>I threw it to you on the train.</i>

01:23:53.237 --> 01:23:54.280
Case.

01:23:54.363 --> 01:23:56.115
<i>- Where'd you put it?</i>
<i>- Green.</i>

01:23:56.198 --> 01:23:58.325
<i>Well, locked, clock.</i>

01:23:58.451 --> 01:24:00.870
Lullaby, lullaby, lullaby.

01:24:01.245 --> 01:24:03.330
<i>Green, gloppy, lullaby)'</i>

01:24:03.748 --> 01:24:05.416
<i>What briefcase?</i>

01:24:09.628 --> 01:24:11.047
I see you.

01:24:11.297 --> 01:24:12.965
I see you.

01:24:14.091 --> 01:24:15.217
I foresee you.

01:24:15.968 --> 01:24:17.386
<i>I foresee you.</i>

01:24:17.511 --> 01:24:19.055
<i>I see you</i>

01:24:19.138 --> 01:24:20.598
<i>I foresee you.</i>

01:24:31.650 --> 01:24:33.319
<i>What happened in that room?</i>

01:24:40.076 --> 01:24:42.411
What happened in that room?

01:24:44.205 --> 01:24:46.749
- That's not what happened.
- I saw it with my own eyes.

01:24:47.041 --> 01:24:49.210
<i>Running out of jokes, are we?</i>

01:24:51.670 --> 01:24:52.963
<i>That's not what happened.</i>

01:25:04.642 --> 01:25:06.685
<i>I saw it with my own eyes.</i>

01:25:13.567 --> 01:25:15.194
There's something that we need to do.

01:25:25.996 --> 01:25:27.373
- Thanks, Charlie.
- Hey, buddy.

01:25:28.457 --> 01:25:29.500
How you doing?

01:25:30.376 --> 01:25:31.710
I'm good.

01:25:34.004 --> 01:25:35.005
How's the girl?

01:25:35.714 --> 01:25:38.801
As far as they'll tell me she's fine.
You did a good job.

01:25:40.261 --> 01:25:41.804
Sorry about Mace.

01:25:42.388 --> 01:25:45.057
And that you didn't get the thing you needed.

01:25:45.224 --> 01:25:46.308
No, no, I got it.

01:25:46.392 --> 01:25:48.686
No, I mean the briefcase.

01:25:48.769 --> 01:25:51.313
Yeah. Yeah, I got the briefcase.

01:25:51.397 --> 01:25:52.898
- You got the briefcase?
- Yeah.

01:25:52.982 --> 01:25:54.608
- I thought that you...
- No, it's here.

01:25:54.775 --> 01:25:57.194
- The case is here?
- Yeah. You want to see it?

01:25:59.071 --> 01:26:00.906
- Yeah.
- Charlie? Can you grab it?

01:26:00.990 --> 01:26:04.326
You know Frank was undercover
when he was killed, right?

01:26:04.410 --> 01:26:06.954
He wasn't selling secrets.
He was returning them.

01:26:07.037 --> 01:26:08.164
Yeah.

01:26:15.671 --> 01:26:17.173
I don't understand.

01:26:19.133 --> 01:26:21.635
What I don't understand is
how you knew the combination.

01:26:21.719 --> 01:26:24.054
That's what I don't understand.

01:26:33.272 --> 01:26:34.273
Right.

01:26:38.319 --> 01:26:39.612
Well...

01:26:41.322 --> 01:26:43.657
Well, this is awkward.

01:26:48.454 --> 01:26:50.289
- They pay you well?
- Matter of fact, they did.

01:26:50.456 --> 01:26:52.750
No, they really did.

01:26:52.833 --> 01:26:55.377
How much was that exactly?
How much was Frank's life worth?

01:26:55.502 --> 01:26:56.962
Does the number even matter, Snow?

01:26:57.046 --> 01:26:59.381
I hope they put you away for a long time.

01:27:01.133 --> 01:27:02.760
You know, I don't think they will.

01:27:04.303 --> 01:27:08.766
You of all people know that they like to keep
all these kind of things on the down-low.

01:27:08.974 --> 01:27:12.061
My guess,
I'll do three years tops at minimum security,

01:27:12.144 --> 01:27:13.145
and you want to know why?

01:27:13.479 --> 01:27:16.899
Because they need people like me.

01:27:16.982 --> 01:27:20.486
I know all of their dirty little secrets.
Ain't that right?

01:27:24.949 --> 01:27:26.325
I am sorry about Frank,

01:27:27.076 --> 01:27:28.702
but in the big scheme of things,

01:27:28.786 --> 01:27:32.414
he'll go down as an innocent bystander.
He won't even make the balance sheet.

01:27:32.498 --> 01:27:34.500
Just like you. Because he's a relic.

01:27:34.833 --> 01:27:37.878
I mean, God, look at you.
Nobody smokes anymore, Snow!

01:27:37.962 --> 01:27:40.547
You know,
for all your bluster and your bullshit,

01:27:40.631 --> 01:27:42.091
you're nothing but cannon-fodder.

01:27:42.216 --> 01:27:44.093
You're cannon-fodder
and they don't need you

01:27:44.176 --> 01:27:46.095
like they need me, okay?

01:27:49.223 --> 01:27:50.224
<i>Ignem feram</i>

01:27:56.146 --> 01:27:57.773
That was from Frank.

01:28:04.863 --> 01:28:05.864
So,

01:28:06.573 --> 01:28:09.618
all this trouble for an empty briefcase.

01:28:09.743 --> 01:28:12.788
Don't let it keep you up at night.
Thanks, Charlie.

01:28:13.038 --> 01:28:14.331
Hey, Snow!

01:28:15.165 --> 01:28:16.458
Good job.

01:28:40.733 --> 01:28:41.734
Take this,

01:28:42.234 --> 01:28:44.111
don't let them take this.

01:28:48.490 --> 01:28:49.491
Frank.

01:28:58.834 --> 01:29:00.252
What's it gonna be, buddy?

01:29:09.178 --> 01:29:11.305
I know something about you.

01:29:11.764 --> 01:29:15.809
Amazing what you can find out
as First Daughter in old Army documents.

01:29:15.893 --> 01:29:17.061
Last name, Snow.

01:29:17.144 --> 01:29:18.729
First name,

01:29:18.812 --> 01:29:20.230
Marion.

01:29:21.106 --> 01:29:23.609
My old man was a big John Wayne fan.

01:29:23.817 --> 01:29:26.236
Must have been tough on the playground.

01:29:28.572 --> 01:29:29.698
That's why I'm so lovable.

01:29:31.492 --> 01:29:33.869
Looks like you're a free man.

01:29:33.952 --> 01:29:35.412
Thanks to you.

01:29:35.829 --> 01:29:37.289
What kind of Robin Hood would I be

01:29:37.373 --> 01:29:39.875
if I didn't stop to rescue Maid Marion
once in a while?

01:29:40.125 --> 01:29:42.503
Okay, you can stop that. Snow's just fine.

01:29:42.586 --> 01:29:45.047
No, I'm getting used to Marion. I really like it.

01:29:45.130 --> 01:29:47.091
Makes me see your feminine side.

01:29:47.174 --> 01:29:48.634
- Great.
- I've got something for you.

01:29:52.679 --> 01:29:54.223
What the hell was that for?

01:29:54.306 --> 01:29:55.891
I owed you that.

01:29:56.809 --> 01:29:59.520
I really feel we need to continue this
on an equitable basis.

01:29:59.603 --> 01:30:02.815
You know, for a minute there,
I thought you were going to kiss me.

01:30:12.741 --> 01:30:13.826
Where's the entourage?

01:30:13.992 --> 01:30:15.411
Gave them the slip.

01:30:15.494 --> 01:30:18.247
- Have you to thank for teaching me that.
- Nice work.

01:30:18.330 --> 01:30:20.249
You're still bleeding, Marion.

01:30:20.332 --> 01:30:21.917
And you wonder
why I didn't tell you my first name?

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:24.711
All right, how about "Sally"?
It has a nice ring to it.

01:30:24.837 --> 01:30:26.755
Yes, it does, but I prefer Snow.

01:30:26.839 --> 01:30:29.425
I can't call you that.
It sounds like an ice cream.

01:30:29.508 --> 01:30:31.927
Speaking of which, I believe you owe me one.

01:30:32.010 --> 01:30:36.473
You know, I've got this feeling
your old man's not going to approve of this.

01:30:36.557 --> 01:30:38.434
I mean, I can't really see this
going anywhere, can you?

01:30:38.517 --> 01:30:40.519
Depends on how good you are in bed.

01:30:40.602 --> 01:30:42.563
Well, in that case,
I give it at least 10 minutes.

01:30:43.305 --> 01:30:49.333
