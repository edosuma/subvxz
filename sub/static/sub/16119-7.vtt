00:18.952 --> 00:20.821
MAN: The Dodge Charger...

00:20.854 --> 00:22.690
the official car
of making a statement

00:22.723 --> 00:24.925
without saying
anything at all.

00:24.958 --> 00:27.928

00:46.647 --> 00:49.617
Good evening,
and welcome to "Montague."

00:49.650 --> 00:51.885
I'm your host,
Franklin Montague.

00:51.919 --> 00:53.387
And today we're gonna
take a look

00:53.421 --> 00:55.889
at the growing outlook
of accepted sexuality

00:55.923 --> 00:58.292
and its effects
on black youth and culture.

00:58.326 --> 00:59.927
With us today, we have

00:59.960 --> 01:02.696
the Head of the Center
of Trans-American Issues,

01:02.730 --> 01:04.198
Dr. Debra Holt,

01:04.232 --> 01:06.734
and recording artist
Paper Boi.

01:06.767 --> 01:08.369
Good evening to you both.

01:08.402 --> 01:09.770
-Good evening, Montague.
-'Sup?

01:09.803 --> 01:11.372
Uh, let's start
at the beginning.

01:11.405 --> 01:14.442
Paper Boi, last Tuesday
you engaged in a Twitter rant

01:14.475 --> 01:17.278
that had some pretty
inflammatory statements.

01:17.311 --> 01:19.079
But the one statement
that seems to have made

01:19.113 --> 01:20.714
-the biggest impact...
-(sighs)

01:20.748 --> 01:22.750
Was this one and I quote,
"Y'all the..."

01:22.783 --> 01:26.654
N-words "who said I was weird
for not wanting to"

01:26.687 --> 01:29.056
F-word "Caitlyn Jenner."

01:29.089 --> 01:31.892
Would you want to, uh,
explain that statement?

01:31.925 --> 01:33.961
No.

01:35.796 --> 01:39.900
Well, could you
explain that statement?

01:39.933 --> 01:42.236
(blows)
I...

01:42.270 --> 01:43.904
meant what I said.

01:43.937 --> 01:47.275
You don't think
your tweets are transphobic?

01:47.308 --> 01:48.809
I just don't have to
have sex

01:48.842 --> 01:50.311
with Caitlyn Jenner
'cause y'all say so.

01:50.344 --> 01:52.112
Mm.
So you don't think

01:52.146 --> 01:53.847
-Caitlyn Jenner's important?
-(tsks)

01:53.881 --> 01:55.349
Look, I get what
y'all saying, right?

01:55.383 --> 01:58.085
But she's not
super important to me,

01:58.118 --> 01:59.653
like, not my life.

01:59.687 --> 02:03.090
So how long
have you disliked transpeople?

02:03.123 --> 02:05.326
Man, look,
I just found out they exist,

02:05.359 --> 02:06.927
-to be honest.
-I--No, no--

02:06.960 --> 02:09.029
"I make her switch sides,
Caitlyn Jenner in reverse"?

02:09.062 --> 02:10.964
Is that not a--
a lyric of yours?

02:10.998 --> 02:12.500
Man, I was just rapping, man.

02:12.533 --> 02:14.435
Look, I've said worse things.

02:14.468 --> 02:16.770
You ever heard my song,
"Illuminati Sex"?

02:16.804 --> 02:18.372
-Haven't heard it yet.
-Well, there we go then.

02:18.406 --> 02:20.174
Debra, you've written

02:20.208 --> 02:22.376
about this current phenomenon
in your book,

02:22.410 --> 02:25.179
Transition:
Gender in a New Generation.

02:25.213 --> 02:27.448
What do you think
about all this?

02:27.481 --> 02:29.350
I look at these statements as

02:29.383 --> 02:31.319
natural consequences
of a culture

02:31.352 --> 02:33.120
-of exclusion and power.
-Mm.

02:33.153 --> 02:34.622
You know, there's--
there's a large swath of...

02:34.655 --> 02:36.824
-(scoffs)
-Gender and sexuality roles

02:36.857 --> 02:39.793
that are just being exposed to
a large portion of the public.

02:39.827 --> 02:41.362
(chuckling)

02:41.395 --> 02:43.464
DEBRA: Uh, it's harder
for certain sections

02:43.497 --> 02:44.998
to deal with this transition

02:45.032 --> 02:47.235
uh, because of conflict
of interest,

02:47.268 --> 02:49.837
and, frankly, identity issues.

02:49.870 --> 02:51.539
In this case,
the rap community.

02:51.572 --> 02:53.541
Now, I truly believe
it's, uh,

02:53.574 --> 02:55.909
has more to do with issues
of masculinity

02:55.943 --> 02:58.312
in the black community
than actual

02:58.346 --> 03:00.414
homophobia or--or transphobia.

03:00.448 --> 03:02.350
-Please explain.
-Yes, please, please.

03:02.383 --> 03:04.051
Tell me--
tell me about myself.

03:04.084 --> 03:05.653
Go on.

03:05.686 --> 03:08.256
Well, Mis--Mister, uh, Pa--
Mr. Paper Boi--

03:08.289 --> 03:09.557
Mister, yeah.

03:09.590 --> 03:12.159
What would you
consider yourself?

03:12.192 --> 03:13.327
A rapper?

03:13.361 --> 03:14.395
A straight rapper?

03:14.428 --> 03:15.863
Hell yeah.

03:15.896 --> 03:17.531
Well, I did some research
on your lyrics,

03:17.565 --> 03:20.100
and they're actually
very pro sexual-spectrum.

03:20.133 --> 03:21.435
-Oh?
-Pro-what?

03:21.469 --> 03:23.737
"If I eff with you,
you my N-word,

03:23.771 --> 03:25.205
you my N-word for life."

03:25.239 --> 03:26.607
Yo, you know
that ain't what I meant.

03:26.640 --> 03:27.875
Yeah, oh, I understand,
but, you know,

03:27.908 --> 03:29.343
there's a layer of fluidity...

03:29.377 --> 03:30.878
No, no, no.
There's no extra layer.

03:30.911 --> 03:32.746
DEBRA: That you yourself
don't even realize.

03:32.780 --> 03:34.348
I don't think about
what I'm rapping half the time.

03:34.382 --> 03:35.416
Look, I'm just trying
to get paid,

03:35.449 --> 03:36.750
you feel me?
Look, (bleep),

03:36.784 --> 03:38.519
why you think
I'm on this show?

03:38.552 --> 03:41.589
You're not
getting paid for this.

03:41.622 --> 03:43.924
Hey--
Hey, Earn--man?

03:43.957 --> 03:46.560
Black men aren't ready
to accept the implications

03:46.594 --> 03:48.296
of a trans-accepting culture.

03:48.329 --> 03:50.097
No--look, I'm allowed
to say that it's weird.

03:50.130 --> 03:51.599
"It"?

03:51.632 --> 03:52.966
No, look, I'm not
calling him a "it."

03:53.000 --> 03:54.368
-Naw, I'm just saying that--
-"Him"?

03:54.402 --> 03:55.903
Look--look, can I say something?
Damn!

03:55.936 --> 03:57.438
FRANKLIN: All right.
-Well, it depends.

03:57.471 --> 03:59.139
-I was trying to say--
-We got to take a break.

03:59.172 --> 04:00.774
When we're back,
we're gonna take a look

04:00.808 --> 04:03.644
into a young boy's struggle
for equality.

04:03.677 --> 04:04.645
(theme music playing)

04:04.678 --> 04:05.913

(beep)

04:26.199 --> 04:27.501
$1.49?

04:27.535 --> 04:29.570
But the price
on the can, though.

04:29.603 --> 04:31.104
The price
is on the can, though.

04:31.138 --> 04:33.841
(crowd cheers on phone)

04:33.874 --> 04:36.977

MAN: The Dodge Charger.

05:45.012 --> 05:47.881
Make a statement without
saying anything at all.

05:49.016 --> 05:52.486
(theme music playing)

05:52.520 --> 05:54.187
Earlier in our show,
we talked about

05:54.221 --> 05:55.923
transitions in sexuality.

05:55.956 --> 05:57.725
Uh, but what about race?

05:57.758 --> 06:00.193
Our correspondent,
Nathan Wielder,

06:00.227 --> 06:01.395
has the story.

06:10.370 --> 06:11.939
Harrison looks from the outside

06:11.972 --> 06:13.707
to be your average teenager.

06:13.741 --> 06:16.410
He goes to school,
plays video games,

06:16.444 --> 06:19.112
even listens to music
in his room.

06:19.146 --> 06:20.848
But there's one difference.

06:20.881 --> 06:23.451
I'm a 35-year-old white man.

06:23.484 --> 06:25.886
NATHAN: Harrison,
born Antwoine Smalls,

06:25.919 --> 06:27.855
has trans-racial identity,

06:27.888 --> 06:29.590
identifying as Harrison Booth,

06:29.623 --> 06:32.893
a 35-year-old white man
from Colorado.

06:32.926 --> 06:34.394
And when did you know
that you were a

06:34.428 --> 06:36.029
35-year-old white man?

06:36.063 --> 06:37.565
Well, I've always
felt different.

06:37.598 --> 06:39.967
I go to the store,
the movies,

06:40.000 --> 06:41.535
and just be thinking
to myself, like,

06:41.569 --> 06:44.738
"Why am I not getting
the respect I deserve?"

06:44.772 --> 06:47.908
And then,
it just hit me.

06:47.941 --> 06:50.043
I'm white...

06:50.077 --> 06:51.779
and 35.

06:51.812 --> 06:53.881
I just miss Colorado sometimes,
you know.

06:53.914 --> 06:55.749
Here, I pretend the buildings
are the old

06:55.783 --> 06:58.385
San Juan Mountain ranges but,
you know, the jobs is here.

06:58.418 --> 06:59.820
And where do you work?

06:59.853 --> 07:01.589
I'm a Systems Engineer
for Coca-Cola.

07:01.622 --> 07:02.556
Oh. Okay.

07:02.590 --> 07:03.791
That boy don't work.

07:03.824 --> 07:05.392
He go to school,
and that's it.

07:05.425 --> 07:06.594
-Mm-hmm.
-One day, he said,

07:06.627 --> 07:08.261
"Call me Harrison."

07:08.295 --> 07:10.230
I said, "Who's that?"

07:10.263 --> 07:11.632
He said, "Me."

07:11.665 --> 07:14.134
Do you believe
that he is a white man?

07:14.167 --> 07:15.769
I mean, he isn't.

07:15.803 --> 07:17.638
(bleep), I'd love
to wake up one day and say,

07:17.671 --> 07:19.840
"Hey, everybody,
I'm Rihanna."

07:19.873 --> 07:20.841
But I ain't.

07:20.874 --> 07:21.842
It's been pretty hard.

07:21.875 --> 07:23.677
My family just doesn't get it.

07:23.711 --> 07:25.913
You know, I try to get them
to go out with me,

07:25.946 --> 07:28.081
go on walks,
go to the farmers market,

07:28.115 --> 07:30.951
chat with people,
but...yeah.

07:30.984 --> 07:33.787
So why don't you think
that they get it?

07:33.821 --> 07:35.523
I don't think
they get it because

07:35.556 --> 07:37.858
they don't realize that race
is just a made-up thing.

07:37.891 --> 07:39.092
Mm-hmm.

07:39.126 --> 07:40.427
They grew up
having labels, and me,

07:40.460 --> 07:41.829
I'm just--I'm just
not like that.

07:41.862 --> 07:43.163
I see.

07:43.196 --> 07:45.499
So how do you embrace
your identity?

07:45.533 --> 07:47.000
-I dress a certain way.
-Ah.

07:47.034 --> 07:48.201
Patagonia.

07:48.235 --> 07:50.137
I wear a thick,
brown leather belt.

07:50.170 --> 07:52.439
I like to envision myself
after the surgery.

07:52.472 --> 07:53.941
(clears throat)

07:53.974 --> 07:57.344
"Hey, excuse me,
what IPA do you have on tap?"

07:57.377 --> 08:01.615
"Hey, did you see
Game of Thrones last night?"

08:01.649 --> 08:03.116
Yeah.

08:03.150 --> 08:04.818
So your--
your surgery,

08:04.852 --> 08:05.986
that's later this year?

08:06.019 --> 08:07.320
Right.
I started working

08:07.354 --> 08:09.056
at Stonecrest Mall,
so hopefully

08:09.089 --> 08:11.158
by then I have enough money
to take the next step.

08:11.191 --> 08:12.526
Mm-hmm.

08:12.560 --> 08:15.896
So you work at Coca-Cola
and the mall?

08:15.929 --> 08:19.199
Right.
Correct, I work at both.

08:19.232 --> 08:21.001
NATHAN: Harrison
has been planning

08:21.034 --> 08:23.804
a full racial transition
with a Dr. Samuel Vergara

08:23.837 --> 08:25.639
who guarantees Harrison
can visually transition

08:25.673 --> 08:27.474
through an experimental
procedure

08:27.507 --> 08:29.810
that will allow Harrison
not only to be a white man

08:29.843 --> 08:31.378
but whatever race he chooses.

08:31.411 --> 08:35.382
The procedure's
absolutely 100% possible.

08:35.415 --> 08:37.685
He's gonna look weird though.

08:37.718 --> 08:39.486
NATHAN: But before Harrison
can fully realize

08:39.519 --> 08:42.189
his physical identity,
he still has the day-to-day

08:42.222 --> 08:44.892
that's filled with
discrimination and ridicule.

08:44.925 --> 08:46.359
It--it's pretty awful,
you know.

08:46.393 --> 08:48.061
You--you walk
in the streets,

08:48.095 --> 08:50.263
and black people, they see you,
they nod to you like,

08:50.297 --> 08:52.032
"Hey, good to see us."

08:52.065 --> 08:54.267
And it's to the point
where I've just given up.

08:54.301 --> 08:56.003
I've stopped trying
to convince them

08:56.036 --> 08:58.739
-that I'm not "us."
-Gotcha.

08:58.772 --> 09:01.074
Hey, excuse me,
this is definitely the guy.

09:01.108 --> 09:03.110
He doesn't even live
in the area.

09:03.143 --> 09:04.745
I've never seen him before.

09:09.149 --> 09:12.119
(police radio chatter)

09:12.152 --> 09:14.054
*

09:14.087 --> 09:16.189
HARRISON: I think
we're taking slow strides,

09:16.223 --> 09:18.291
but you have to believe
things are getting better,

09:18.325 --> 09:20.427
otherwise,
you'll just die inside.

09:20.460 --> 09:22.129
Is there anything
you'd like to say to

09:22.162 --> 09:24.231
other black kids out there
who may be going through

09:24.264 --> 09:25.933
the same thing?

09:25.966 --> 09:27.234
Just be you.

09:27.267 --> 09:29.069
At all costs.

09:29.102 --> 09:30.738
But also,

09:30.771 --> 09:33.306
stop dressing so crazy.

09:33.340 --> 09:34.775
Hmm.

09:34.808 --> 09:37.778
(gentle instrumental music)

09:37.811 --> 09:44.685
*

09:48.789 --> 09:51.725
(guitar music flourishes)

09:51.759 --> 09:53.326
Absolutely.

09:54.494 --> 09:56.096
Hi.

09:56.129 --> 09:58.431
I'm Devyonne Johnson,
famous movie star.

09:58.465 --> 10:01.101
When the director calls cut
and I get a quick five,

10:01.134 --> 10:03.570
you know I'm reaching
for the smooth taste

10:03.603 --> 10:05.505
of Swisher Sweets.

10:05.538 --> 10:08.275
Swisher Sweets are the only
cigarillos made with

10:08.308 --> 10:11.812
the highest quality tobacco
from family-owned farms.

10:11.845 --> 10:13.814
It's their high standards
and experience

10:13.847 --> 10:17.317
that make for a quality smoke
you can enjoy every time.

10:18.618 --> 10:19.953
(sniffs)

10:22.289 --> 10:23.256
(click)

10:23.290 --> 10:29.997
*

10:31.498 --> 10:34.702
(blows)

10:34.735 --> 10:36.369
Yeah...
(chuckles)

10:38.171 --> 10:39.873
I only smoke Swisher Sweets.

10:41.574 --> 10:43.176
It's the smooth taste.

10:45.312 --> 10:48.481
These Swisher Sweets
is good as hell.

10:48.515 --> 10:52.019
Here, make sure
this one's empty.

10:52.052 --> 10:53.486
Swisher Sweets.

10:53.520 --> 10:55.055
There's just
something about 'em.

10:55.088 --> 10:57.991
And try our new pre-dumps
Swisher Sweets as well.

11:04.832 --> 11:07.801
(mellow jazz music)

11:07.835 --> 11:11.739
*

11:12.873 --> 11:16.176
(theme music playing)

11:16.209 --> 11:18.211
And we're back.
And today we're talking about

11:18.245 --> 11:20.080
transitions with my guests,

11:20.113 --> 11:23.550
Atlanta rapper Paper Boi
and Dr. Debra Holt.

11:23.583 --> 11:26.653
Ah, Paper Boi, are you afraid
to speak your mind

11:26.686 --> 11:28.255
on this subject?

11:28.288 --> 11:30.724
Actually, yup, I am.

11:30.758 --> 11:32.760
You can't say real (bleep)
anymore without somebody

11:32.793 --> 11:34.995
trying to make sure
you never make money forever.

11:35.028 --> 11:36.396
FRANKLIN: So you think
you're being persecuted?

11:36.429 --> 11:38.065
Yes, I am.

11:38.098 --> 11:39.767
Man, you can't even say
"ho" in a song no more.

11:39.800 --> 11:41.434
(scoffs)
A travesty, I'm sure.

11:41.468 --> 11:42.702
-(chuckles)
ALFRED: Yo, why you--

11:42.736 --> 11:44.237
Yo, why you talk
like that?

11:44.271 --> 11:45.739
Like, "a travesty, I'm sur--"
like, what?

11:45.773 --> 11:47.707
You're--you're whining
about chickens

11:47.741 --> 11:49.109
-coming home to roost.
-No-no-no-no-no.

11:49.142 --> 11:51.011
Rap is chickens
coming home to roost.

11:51.044 --> 11:53.713
Look, my life is messed up
from (bleep) y'all did, okay?

11:53.747 --> 11:55.282
That's black news.
You can look that up.

11:55.315 --> 11:57.017
Well, your news
is problematic.

11:57.050 --> 11:58.852
-Bitch, that ain't my fault!
-Whoa, whoa, whoa!

11:58.886 --> 12:00.453
I won't have you on my show
calling anyone "bitches."

12:00.487 --> 12:01.855
How you gonna blame me
for news being bad, huh?

12:01.889 --> 12:03.356
FRANKLIN: All right,
simmer down, simmer down.

12:03.390 --> 12:04.758
You can't even have
an intelligent dialogue

12:04.792 --> 12:06.559
-without spewing profanities.
-(groans)

12:06.593 --> 12:07.961
-It's--it's ludicrous.
FRANKLIN: Okay, okay, okay.

12:07.995 --> 12:11.064
Paper Boi,
isn't a lack of a father

12:11.098 --> 12:13.233
the reason you hate transpeople?

12:13.266 --> 12:14.634
What?
Lack of a father?

12:14.667 --> 12:16.436
Man, you hear yourself?
(bleep), shut up.

12:16.469 --> 12:17.737
Man, here's the thing.

12:17.771 --> 12:19.472
Man, I--
it's hard for me to care

12:19.506 --> 12:21.241
about this when nobody
cares about me

12:21.274 --> 12:23.043
as a black human man,
you feel me?

12:23.076 --> 12:24.812
Like, Caitlyn Jenner
is just doing

12:24.845 --> 12:26.446
what rich white men been doing
since the dawn of time,

12:26.479 --> 12:28.081
which is whatever
the hell he want.

12:28.115 --> 12:30.750
So why should I care?
What make him so special?

12:30.784 --> 12:32.452
But--but as a black man
in this country,

12:32.485 --> 12:34.621
shouldn't you care about
the civil liberties of others,

12:34.654 --> 12:36.089
since they're
so closely related to--to

12:36.123 --> 12:37.490
your struggle for equality?

12:37.524 --> 12:39.292
What you talking 'bout?
I do care.

12:39.326 --> 12:41.228
Look, I don't have a problem
with gay people, transpeople,

12:41.261 --> 12:42.896
because that's tolerance,
but where's tolerance

12:42.930 --> 12:45.298
for people like me?
You know what I'm saying?

12:45.332 --> 12:48.735
Like...
(sighs) Look.

12:48.768 --> 12:50.637
I should be able
to say something is weird

12:50.670 --> 12:52.505
without people hating on me.
All right?

12:52.539 --> 12:55.308
Look, I never--
I never said anything

12:55.342 --> 12:56.743
about taking away
nobody's rights.

12:56.776 --> 12:58.011
A'ight? Never.

12:58.045 --> 12:59.479
I--I understand
what you're saying,

12:59.512 --> 13:01.849
but--but some people
found your remarks offensive.

13:01.882 --> 13:04.818
Yeah, well,
freedom of speech, (bleep).

13:06.053 --> 13:08.455
No, you're right.

13:08.488 --> 13:09.990
I agree.

13:15.028 --> 13:19.132
But your music is detrimental
to black teens.

13:19.166 --> 13:22.335
(scoffs) Yeah, but so is
all rap music, right?

13:22.369 --> 13:23.636
-I mean, and rock music...
-Rock.

13:23.670 --> 13:24.972
Before it was
taken over by rap.

13:25.005 --> 13:27.007
Yeah, I agree.

13:27.040 --> 13:29.809
You hate... women!

13:29.843 --> 13:30.978
(bleep), what?

13:31.011 --> 13:35.182
(theme music playing)

13:35.215 --> 13:37.217
Questions.

13:37.250 --> 13:39.186
The universe.

13:39.219 --> 13:41.488
Paternity tests?

13:41.521 --> 13:42.990
Salutations.

13:43.023 --> 13:44.624
(gentle music)

13:44.657 --> 13:47.027
Hi.
My name is Ahmad White.

13:47.060 --> 13:49.162
You may know me
from your dreams.

13:49.196 --> 13:50.530
Call this number below

13:50.563 --> 13:52.866
and get the answers
you deserve.

13:52.900 --> 13:54.001
(upbeat music)

13:54.034 --> 13:55.502
When I called Ahmad White,

13:55.535 --> 13:57.637
I was three months behind
on my car note.

13:57.670 --> 13:59.873
(scoffs) My stepson,
he was in jail.

13:59.907 --> 14:02.910
My life was in shambles!

14:02.943 --> 14:04.544
But now, I got a truck,

14:04.577 --> 14:07.314
I got a girlfriend,

14:07.347 --> 14:09.682
I got the answers I deserve.

14:09.716 --> 14:11.985
Thank you, Ahmad White.

14:12.019 --> 14:13.486
Most people don't realize

14:13.520 --> 14:16.256
their chakra's
in another universe.

14:16.289 --> 14:17.991
Don't be dumb.

14:18.025 --> 14:19.592
Call now.

14:19.626 --> 14:22.662
Me and Ahmad found out
I was a moon sign,

14:22.695 --> 14:25.165
and I wasn't getting enough
crystal in my diet.

14:25.198 --> 14:28.168
Now, I live
in a beautiful home.

14:28.201 --> 14:30.437
Ahmad gave me the answers
I was looking for.

14:30.470 --> 14:31.905
Come to our Liberty Center

14:31.939 --> 14:34.607
and get a free juice
and Nutella sandwich.

14:34.641 --> 14:37.911
When I called Ahmad,
my life was going nowhere fast.

14:37.945 --> 14:40.113
After a Nutella sandwich
and juice,

14:40.147 --> 14:42.115
my life's a lot better.

14:42.149 --> 14:45.285
(upbeat tone sustained)

14:45.318 --> 14:46.619
Open your third eye.

14:46.653 --> 14:48.255
He works.

14:48.288 --> 14:49.789
He just works.

14:49.822 --> 14:52.960
He works.
He really works.

14:52.993 --> 14:55.362
He works.
He really, really works.

14:55.395 --> 14:57.764
Knowledge is the path
to greatness.

14:57.797 --> 15:00.600
If you'd like to be
smart as a baby dolphin,

15:00.633 --> 15:02.235
call now.

15:02.269 --> 15:05.138
(ethereal music)

15:08.341 --> 15:11.311

music)

15:11.344 --> 15:13.313
*

15:13.346 --> 15:15.015
(engine revs)

15:20.687 --> 15:22.222
That's a nice car.

15:22.255 --> 15:23.823
You know him?

15:23.856 --> 15:25.925
That's Victor Wallace.

15:25.959 --> 15:28.461
His wife left him
for his brother.

15:28.495 --> 15:30.463
Long court battle.

15:30.497 --> 15:32.732
Kids, house--

15:32.765 --> 15:35.135
It got messy.

15:35.168 --> 15:38.138
He ain't say one word
the whole trial.

15:38.171 --> 15:40.673
But then at the end,
he just stood up and said,

15:40.707 --> 15:43.676
"Leave me my Dodge Charger."

15:47.147 --> 15:49.482
He been driving around
this neighborhood

15:49.516 --> 15:51.351
in circles for a week.

15:51.384 --> 15:54.821
-Just waving.
-Mm.

15:54.854 --> 15:56.956
Nice car though.

15:56.990 --> 15:58.358
(nozzle fumbling)

15:58.391 --> 16:01.361
(upbeat hip-hop instrumental
music)

16:01.394 --> 16:06.699

16:06.733 --> 16:08.035

16:08.068 --> 16:09.636

16:09.669 --> 16:12.839
MAN: The Dodge Charger.
Keep it in the divorce.

16:14.974 --> 16:17.344
(gasps)
King Coco's Crunch-O's.

16:17.377 --> 16:19.679
The legend is true!

16:19.712 --> 16:20.713
(creaking)

16:20.747 --> 16:22.549
Gimme that crunch!

16:22.582 --> 16:24.017
No!

16:24.051 --> 16:25.018
(grunts)

16:25.052 --> 16:26.286
Nice try.

16:26.319 --> 16:27.354
But only kids can have...

16:27.387 --> 16:29.556
all: Coconut Crunch-O's.

16:29.589 --> 16:31.691
WOLF: That chocolatey
coconut crunch

16:31.724 --> 16:33.526
in every bite.
(crunches)

16:33.560 --> 16:35.728
Oh, I can almost taste it!

16:35.762 --> 16:37.230
Bbbbbb!

16:37.264 --> 16:38.498
(train horn whistles)

16:38.531 --> 16:40.900
Oh, I got to have
them Crunch-O's!

16:40.933 --> 16:42.235
-(grunts)
-Ow! Ow!

16:42.269 --> 16:44.003
Man!
Ow!

16:44.037 --> 16:46.206
-Stop resisting.
-(pained groans)

16:46.239 --> 16:48.141
-Stop resisting, sir.
-(pained struggle) Damn!

16:48.175 --> 16:50.177
-Stop...resisting.
-Shit, man!

16:50.210 --> 16:52.312
Oh! Mother--
(grunts)

16:52.345 --> 16:53.513
Stay down.
(handcuffs click)

16:53.546 --> 16:54.714
What happened?

16:54.747 --> 16:55.915
He's going to jail.

16:55.948 --> 16:57.016
That's what happened.

16:57.050 --> 16:58.851
This is some bullshit!

16:58.885 --> 16:59.886
You all right?

16:59.919 --> 17:01.188
He's fine.

17:01.221 --> 17:03.156
He just doesn't wanna
go to jail.

17:03.190 --> 17:04.424
You sitting on my back, man!

17:04.457 --> 17:05.425
(bones crack)
Ah!

17:05.458 --> 17:06.693
Sir, be quiet.

17:06.726 --> 17:08.328
Yo!
You sitting on his back!

17:08.361 --> 17:10.197
He was trying
to steal your cereal, right?

17:10.230 --> 17:12.065
I mean,
it's just cereal.

17:12.099 --> 17:13.200
He can have it!

17:13.233 --> 17:15.168
Man, I'm just hungry, man!

17:15.202 --> 17:17.170
They don't let wolves
in stores, man!

17:17.204 --> 17:18.571
Step back, guys.

17:18.605 --> 17:20.039
I'm going to
lift the offender up.

17:20.073 --> 17:22.409
We are now going
to our feet, sir.

17:22.442 --> 17:24.177
Let's go, sir, let's go.

17:24.211 --> 17:26.246
Nigga, I could be
eating these kids!

17:26.279 --> 17:28.181
But I'm out here
eating cereal!

17:28.215 --> 17:29.549
Hey, it's cool!

17:29.582 --> 17:31.284
We'll just give him
the cereal.

17:31.318 --> 17:32.685
No, only kids

17:32.719 --> 17:35.021
can have Coconut Crunch-O's.
You know that.

17:35.054 --> 17:36.589
(tsks)
That's a wack law.

17:36.623 --> 17:39.292
This fool know he eat
Coconut Crunch-O's,

17:39.326 --> 17:41.228

Let me do my job.

17:43.396 --> 17:46.199

this balanced breakfast.

17:59.078 --> 18:02.782
(theme music playing)

18:02.815 --> 18:05.452
Earlier we showed a clip
about a young man

18:05.485 --> 18:08.388
dealing with trans-racial
identity.

18:08.421 --> 18:11.924
Well, we've got him joining us
via Facebook video chat.

18:11.958 --> 18:14.627
Please welcome
Antwoine Smalls to the show.

18:14.661 --> 18:17.497
Hello, Montague, thank you
for having me on your show.

18:17.530 --> 18:19.232
-So now, Antwoine...
ALFRED: (laughs)

18:19.266 --> 18:21.834
-It's Harrison.
-I'm sorry.

18:21.868 --> 18:24.137
-Harrison.
-(chuckling)

18:24.171 --> 18:26.473
FRANKLIN: How's your life been
since we last saw you?

18:26.506 --> 18:27.574
ALFRED: Ohh...

18:27.607 --> 18:29.008
It's pretty good.

18:29.041 --> 18:31.178
I just came back
from Charleston, South Carolina.

18:31.211 --> 18:32.779
FRANKLIN: Ah.
-Beautiful.

18:32.812 --> 18:34.347
I was checking out
some cheap art spaces

18:34.381 --> 18:36.115
for me and a friend
that I made, uh--

18:36.149 --> 18:37.750
What--wait--
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

18:37.784 --> 18:39.952
Yo. This is dumb.

18:39.986 --> 18:41.821
-Like, that--this is dumb.
DEBRA: What--

18:41.854 --> 18:43.623
ALFRED: Like, dude, wait, wait.
Did you power up?

18:43.656 --> 18:45.292
'Cause you look like
Super Saiyan right now.

18:45.325 --> 18:47.093
Like, is that, like,
is that the Goku...

18:47.126 --> 18:48.328
FRANKLIN: (sighs)
-Like Dragon Ball collection,

18:48.361 --> 18:49.929
my (bleep), like?
You look like

18:49.962 --> 18:51.431
-a fake Ellen DeGeneres.
-This is just...

18:51.464 --> 18:53.266
-Like a Felon DeGeneres.
-Okay.

18:53.300 --> 18:56.035
Look, no-no-no, you look
like Drake Malfoy, dude, like.

18:56.068 --> 18:58.538
Bangs, my (bleep)?
Like, nobody told you

18:58.571 --> 19:00.207
-not to do bangs--Like--
FRANKLIN: Okay, okay.

19:00.240 --> 19:02.342
-Nice tolerance.
FRANKLIN: Mr. Boi.

19:02.375 --> 19:04.010
ALFRED: What is up--Wait, wait--
-Okay, okay, thank you.

19:04.043 --> 19:05.812
-None of y'all? Okay.
FRANKLIN: Thank you.

19:05.845 --> 19:07.146
-That is very inappropriate.
-Sorry, man, go ahead.

19:07.180 --> 19:08.981
-Shh.
-It's--it's okay.

19:09.015 --> 19:11.518
Sadly, the black community,
they just aren't accepting

19:11.551 --> 19:13.152
of racial diversity or

19:13.186 --> 19:14.687
anyone different,
for that matter.

19:14.721 --> 19:17.023
-Mm. Now, Harrison...
ALFRED: (groans)

19:17.056 --> 19:19.058
Would you say that, uh,
the--the rap game

19:19.091 --> 19:21.694
or the hip-hop community
is especially intolerant

19:21.728 --> 19:23.630
of the lifestyle you chose?

19:23.663 --> 19:26.065
We really can't blame rap
or the hip-hop culture.

19:26.098 --> 19:28.801
He's just expressing himself
to the best of his ability.

19:28.835 --> 19:31.137
And I will defend
his right to do that.

19:31.170 --> 19:33.673
He's telling a story, or, like,
views from the streets.

19:33.706 --> 19:35.308
-You know, like a ghetto news.
-Mm.

19:35.342 --> 19:37.176
-Okay. (snickers)
-But--but Harrison,

19:37.210 --> 19:39.412
don't you think
that the rap community

19:39.446 --> 19:42.148
and its treatment of transpeople
and homosexuals

19:42.181 --> 19:45.218
is indicative of a larger
problem in the black community,

19:45.252 --> 19:47.854
one that makes
your lifestyle unacceptable?

19:47.887 --> 19:49.522
No, no way.
Not at all.

19:49.556 --> 19:52.525
I mean, a man wanting
to turn himself into a woman--

19:52.559 --> 19:54.494
that's just unnatural,
and I don't think

19:54.527 --> 19:57.330
we should have our kids
thinking that that's okay.

19:57.364 --> 19:58.898
So I will support that message.

19:58.931 --> 20:00.400
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

20:00.433 --> 20:01.668
-What are you saying?
-(stifled laugh)

20:01.701 --> 20:03.169
I'm not into gay marriage.

20:03.202 --> 20:04.704
That--that is gross.

20:04.737 --> 20:06.239
Why would I ever tolerate
something like that?

20:06.273 --> 20:07.674
Marriage is meant for

20:07.707 --> 20:09.276
a man and a woman,
not that--

20:09.309 --> 20:11.378
that's an abomination.
We're--We--No.

20:11.411 --> 20:13.045
How can you say that

20:13.079 --> 20:14.781
with the discrimination
you were just talking about?

20:14.814 --> 20:16.349
-I mean, how--
-It's the truth.

20:16.383 --> 20:19.018
-What are you, crazy?
-This (bleep) crazy!

20:19.051 --> 20:20.687
That is all the time
we have tonight.

20:20.720 --> 20:22.455
-I'd like to thank my guests...
ALFRED: Oh, my God.

20:22.489 --> 20:24.591
-Dr. Holt, Paper Boi.
ALFRED: (chuckling)

20:24.624 --> 20:27.394
Please check for her book
Transition,

20:27.427 --> 20:30.096
as well as
Paper Boi's mixtape Postal.

20:30.129 --> 20:31.898
ALFRED: Yup!
-Available...

20:31.931 --> 20:34.901
wherever mixtapes
are available.

20:34.934 --> 20:37.470
-Good night.
ALFRED: (laughing)

20:37.504 --> 20:40.740
Like, you look
like a dying palm tree.

20:40.773 --> 20:43.443
Right? Like you look like
the lost fifth Beatle,

20:43.476 --> 20:45.211
my (bleep), that they just
don't talk about.

20:45.244 --> 20:47.314
That, like, power up,
like--

20:47.347 --> 20:49.916
they gave him (bleep) bangs,
like--(laughing).

20:49.949 --> 20:51.584
DEBRA: I don't care for it.

20:51.618 --> 20:54.587
(theme music playing)

20:54.621 --> 21:01.461
*

21:49.976 --> 21:51.844
(dramatic music)

21:53.179 --> 21:55.047
(low sustained tone)
