02:15.509 --> 02:16.719
Fire!

02:42.995 --> 02:44.580
Interesting.

02:57.134 --> 02:58.844
Guard? Guard?

03:00.638 --> 03:01.722
Guard!

03:06.519 --> 03:09.230
Help me!

03:15.820 --> 03:17.488
You gotta give Mr. Freeze credit.

03:17.571 --> 03:20.157
That's the most original breakout
this year.

03:20.241 --> 03:22.034
Yes, but I don't think he was behind it.

03:22.118 --> 03:24.120
Look at the expression of fear
on his face.

03:24.245 --> 03:25.454
That's not easy to fake,

03:25.538 --> 03:28.332
especially for a man
claiming to be dead to emotions.

03:28.416 --> 03:30.209
Freeze was taken against his will,

03:30.292 --> 03:32.795
and obviously by someone
with expertise in robotics.

03:32.962 --> 03:36.424
Then maybe we'd better consult
our own robot expert.

03:43.597 --> 03:45.266
Greetings, dynamic duo.

03:45.349 --> 03:46.684
I'm your biggest fan.

03:48.227 --> 03:49.937
What is it?

03:53.107 --> 03:54.483
I just wanna help.

03:57.027 --> 03:59.280
Just wanna help. Just wanna help.

04:00.656 --> 04:01.866
Poor little critter.

04:01.949 --> 04:03.993
I never could get his programming right.

04:04.076 --> 04:05.286
Cute toy, Karl.

04:05.369 --> 04:08.414
You know I'm out
of the robot business, Batman.

04:10.082 --> 04:13.169
All I make anymore are little friends
to keep me company.

04:13.252 --> 04:14.462
Like Tiny, here?

04:15.713 --> 04:18.215
Well, if it isn't old M-9.

04:18.299 --> 04:20.342
- It's one of yours?
- Not really.

04:20.468 --> 04:23.554
I once created a smaller prototype
for Grant Walker.

04:23.929 --> 04:25.931
- The guy who builds those theme parks?
- Yeah.

04:26.015 --> 04:28.642
I was one of Walker's
original visioneers.

04:28.726 --> 04:31.437
Constructing and programming
the animatronic figures

04:31.520 --> 04:33.439
he used in his park attractions.

04:33.731 --> 04:37.109
Though it looks like old Grant's boys
pumped up the design a bit.

04:37.193 --> 04:39.653
I'm wondering
how improved these robots are.

04:39.820 --> 04:42.656
And why one of them was sent
to kidnap Mr. Freeze.

05:16.440 --> 05:18.025
Impressive.

05:18.108 --> 05:19.401
"Impressive?"

05:19.485 --> 05:22.029
You gaze upon all this
and can only say "impressive"?

05:22.238 --> 05:24.615
Though perhaps I shouldn't be surprised.

05:25.074 --> 05:29.036
I've made a hobby of studying
your chilly history, Victor Fries.

05:29.245 --> 05:30.788
And you are?

05:30.996 --> 05:32.915
Grant Walker, at your service, sir.

05:33.082 --> 05:36.585
This is Oceana,
my prototype vision of the future.

05:36.877 --> 05:39.672
A vision that
you shall help make a reality.

05:39.839 --> 05:41.048
Doubtful.

05:41.131 --> 05:42.258
We'll see.

05:42.341 --> 05:44.343
Make sure that our guest is comfortable.

05:48.013 --> 05:50.599
<i>Sir, we've picked up
an unauthorized craft entering our area.</i>

05:51.684 --> 05:55.104
Can't afford nosy trespassers
at this stage of the game.

05:55.187 --> 05:57.857
Dispatch our usual deterrents,
Mr. Johnson.

06:03.320 --> 06:06.782
I still don't see why a theme-park mogul
would kidnap Mr. Freeze.

06:06.866 --> 06:09.743
Men like Walker are obsessed
with getting their own way.

06:09.827 --> 06:12.621
And they don't let little things
like the law stop them.

06:13.873 --> 06:15.499
I'm picking something up on the scanner.

06:15.583 --> 06:17.501
Three small objects coming in fast.

06:38.314 --> 06:39.356
Hang on!

07:02.171 --> 07:03.422
The power shorted out.

07:03.505 --> 07:05.549
And those things are coming back.

07:13.557 --> 07:15.309
Intruder threat
has been neutralized, sir.

07:15.392 --> 07:16.727
<i>Excellent.</i>

07:28.113 --> 07:30.074
Looks like we're swimming home.

07:30.157 --> 07:32.910
Not before we have a talk
with Mr. Walker.

07:57.184 --> 08:00.646
I think you'll find that suit
is a perfect duplicate of your original.

08:00.729 --> 08:03.983
Automatic temperature control,
increased cybernetic strength.

08:04.191 --> 08:06.151
Even the cold gun works.

08:19.373 --> 08:22.668
Yes. Logically,
I should do the same to you.

08:22.751 --> 08:24.461
Just hear me out, please.

08:24.545 --> 08:27.089
As I said,
I've studied you and your work.

08:27.172 --> 08:29.299
Do you realize that in your frozen state

08:29.383 --> 08:32.928
you'll age much slower
than an ordinary human?

08:33.012 --> 08:35.431
You're practically immortal, my friend.

08:35.514 --> 08:39.977
Yes, eternal life
trapped in this wretched shell.

08:40.144 --> 08:42.062
What a miserable joke.

08:42.187 --> 08:46.150
Oh, miserable to you,
but a godsend to me.

08:46.233 --> 08:48.694
Look at me, Mr. Freeze. I'm an old man.

08:48.777 --> 08:51.363
I've created wonders in my lifetime,

08:51.447 --> 08:53.824
but there is still so much to do.

08:53.991 --> 08:56.035
I want to change as you have.

08:56.118 --> 09:01.415
To become like you,
a being of blessed, eternal cold.

09:01.790 --> 09:03.459
You're insane.

09:03.542 --> 09:07.546
Only you have the know-how to duplicate
the accident that made you what you are.

09:07.629 --> 09:10.049
What I long to become.

09:11.467 --> 09:13.427
You want to live like this?

09:13.510 --> 09:15.804
Abandoned and alone?

09:15.888 --> 09:19.016
A prisoner in a world you can see,
but never touch?

09:23.103 --> 09:25.564
Old and infirm as you are,

09:25.647 --> 09:30.194
I'd trade 1,000 of my frozen years
for your worst day.

09:30.569 --> 09:32.029
Actually,

09:32.112 --> 09:35.074
I had another kind of swap in mind.

09:42.581 --> 09:43.957
Nora.

09:44.041 --> 09:47.127
I was a major investor in GothCorp
a few years back

09:47.211 --> 09:50.130
and put up some money
for their cryogenics program.

09:51.423 --> 09:55.094
I trust you know the young lady
behind the glass.

09:57.179 --> 09:58.305
My wife.

09:58.388 --> 10:01.558
The GothCorp execs
think she perished in the fire,

10:01.642 --> 10:02.976
but my men got her out.

10:03.060 --> 10:06.313
I have the technology
to restore her, my friend.

10:06.396 --> 10:09.441
All you have to do is grant my wish.

10:10.818 --> 10:12.361
Very well.

11:00.159 --> 11:02.035
<i>Welcome, friends.</i>

11:02.119 --> 11:06.540
<i>Thanks to all our hard work,
Oceana's nearly up and running.</i>

11:06.665 --> 11:10.711
<i>Now, while most folks believe
Oceana's just another theme park,</i>

11:10.961 --> 11:12.713
<i>we know better.</i>

11:12.921 --> 11:16.425
<i>Fact of the matter is,
it's not too nice out there anymore.</i>

11:16.508 --> 11:19.052
<i>Crime, hatred, violence.</i>

11:19.178 --> 11:21.054
<i>Things keep going on like that,</i>

11:21.388 --> 11:23.765
<i>it could mean the end of civilization.</i>

11:23.932 --> 11:29.188
<i>That's why I decided to build a city
where good folks can live in peace.</i>

11:29.605 --> 11:32.357
<i>A new Garden of Eden, you might say,</i>

11:32.441 --> 11:35.194
<i>from which a new race
of people can spring.</i>

11:35.485 --> 11:38.697
<i>Now, of course you can't have spring
without a little winter.</i>

11:38.989 --> 11:41.241
<i>About five years of it, I'd say.</i>

11:44.578 --> 11:46.288
<i>Now, don't anybody worry.</i>

11:46.371 --> 11:49.917
<i>We'll all be warm as toast in here.</i>

11:50.000 --> 11:53.295
<i>As for those folks outside,
well, it's sad,</i>

11:53.378 --> 11:56.673
<i>but I'm only speeding up
what they were doing to themselves.</i>

11:56.798 --> 11:58.675
Brother. He's all heart, isn't he?

11:58.759 --> 12:00.219
Walker's a madman.

12:00.636 --> 12:01.887
Whoa!

12:33.627 --> 12:36.129
- Look.
<i>- Every time I open a park,</i>

12:36.213 --> 12:38.215
<i>I get gate-crashers.</i>

12:38.298 --> 12:41.343
We've seen your insane vision
of the future, Walker.

12:41.551 --> 12:46.390
<i>My world will have no crime,
violence, or pain.</i>

12:46.556 --> 12:48.976
You can add free will to that list too.

12:49.059 --> 12:51.103
<i>A small price to pay for order.</i>

12:51.353 --> 12:52.604
Your order.

12:52.688 --> 12:54.189
For your select few.

12:54.314 --> 12:57.317
<i>Excuse me, but I fail to see
the problem with that.</i>

13:20.757 --> 13:24.344
Freeze, I don't know
what Walker said or promised you,

13:24.553 --> 13:26.513
but you can't help him
go through with this plan.

13:26.680 --> 13:29.099
I have no choice.

13:47.784 --> 13:49.536
I know it's a bit chilly
in there,

13:49.619 --> 13:52.331
but I figured you'd like to stick around
and see the show.

13:52.414 --> 13:53.790
How are we doing?

13:56.209 --> 13:57.336
Ready.

13:57.419 --> 13:58.712
Let's do it.

14:28.450 --> 14:30.118
Incredible.

14:30.202 --> 14:33.163
This suit has more power
than I ever dreamed.

14:35.957 --> 14:37.125
Oh!

14:38.502 --> 14:39.753
Are you all right, sir?

14:39.836 --> 14:42.297
This takes
a little getting used to.

14:42.381 --> 14:45.717
Once Project Deep Freeze is completed,
you won't need the suit.

14:45.801 --> 14:47.469
Well, let's get that started.

14:47.552 --> 14:48.804
Coming, Mr. Freeze?

14:49.054 --> 14:50.847
I've done what you wanted.

14:50.931 --> 14:53.016
Now leave me alone with my wife.

14:53.642 --> 14:55.143
Suit yourself.

14:56.061 --> 14:57.813
You can't let Walker do this.

14:57.979 --> 14:59.940
Billions of people will perish.

15:00.023 --> 15:01.775
That's not my concern.

15:01.858 --> 15:04.820
All that matters is
I once again have my wife

15:04.903 --> 15:06.571
and the means to restore her.

15:07.280 --> 15:11.827
She'll wake up in a dead, frozen world
that you helped destroy.

15:11.910 --> 15:13.161
She'll hate you for that.

15:13.245 --> 15:14.496
SHence.

15:14.579 --> 15:16.248
You think you're alone now?

15:16.331 --> 15:17.999
Wait until she learns the truth.

15:18.083 --> 15:20.669
I said silence!

15:31.471 --> 15:33.140
Forgive me.

15:41.690 --> 15:43.984
Come. There is much to do.

15:50.699 --> 15:52.492
The cannon is operational, sir.

16:06.631 --> 16:08.008
Excellent.

16:10.802 --> 16:14.055
Ah! You've come to join us after all,
my friend.

16:17.976 --> 16:19.352
Wait. What are you doing?

16:29.321 --> 16:30.489
Stop him!

17:12.989 --> 17:14.824
This is my dream.

17:14.908 --> 17:16.284
My vision!

17:16.368 --> 17:21.122
I cheated death to make it real,
and you won't stop me.

17:21.206 --> 17:26.044
You may live forever, Grant Walker,
but your mad dream dies now.

17:35.387 --> 17:38.265
What are you doing?
That's the main power core.

17:38.348 --> 17:40.976
An overload will blow this city
out of the water.

17:41.059 --> 17:42.185
Exactly.

17:51.278 --> 17:53.989
<i>Attention, all residents of Oceana.</i>

17:54.072 --> 17:56.032
<i>Your city is doomed.</i>

17:56.241 --> 17:59.411
<i>If you value your lives,
you will evacuate now.</i>

17:59.619 --> 18:01.037
<i>That is all.</i>

18:08.295 --> 18:10.797
- Mr. Walker!
- Get out of here. Now!

18:28.189 --> 18:29.899
There's our ride.

18:30.525 --> 18:33.320
- Let's go.
- I'm staying with Nora.

18:33.403 --> 18:36.323
Don't be a fool.
This whole place is going under.

18:36.406 --> 18:38.408
I won't lose her again.

18:39.743 --> 18:41.328
There's nothing you can do for her.

18:41.411 --> 18:42.621
Come with us.

18:44.414 --> 18:46.750
I am the least of your worries.

18:53.923 --> 18:55.925
Take the boy and go.

18:59.721 --> 19:02.140
Relax. You're going to be okay.

19:16.571 --> 19:19.282
We're together again, my love.

19:59.864 --> 20:01.074
Man...

20:01.157 --> 20:03.243
If I spent any more time
in that immersion tank,

20:03.326 --> 20:04.369
I'd be growing gills.

20:04.452 --> 20:06.955
I'm just glad I was able to
get you back here in time.

20:07.038 --> 20:08.289
Thanks.

20:08.456 --> 20:10.208
For a while
I thought I'd wind up like Walker,

20:10.291 --> 20:11.793
trapped in an ice cube forever.

20:12.919 --> 20:14.337
What about Mr. Freeze?

20:14.421 --> 20:15.880
You think he's gone for good?

20:15.964 --> 20:17.048
I'm not sure.

20:17.132 --> 20:20.760
But if Freeze's condition
has made him truly immortal,

20:21.302 --> 20:23.763
<i>we may not have seen the last of him.</i>

21:08.725 --> 21:09.726
English - SDH
