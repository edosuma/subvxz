WEBVTT

00:11.112 --> 00:13.214
Morning, Leslie.

00:14.815 --> 00:16.350
Lakeman.

00:18.000 --> 00:24.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:25.059 --> 00:27.927
So what should I do?

00:27.928 --> 00:29.329
About your weird co-worker?

00:29.330 --> 00:32.631
Yeah. He's lying
about me now, too.

00:32.633 --> 00:34.033
Narc on him.

00:34.034 --> 00:38.037
But listen, I'm not fucking
around about you being sure.

00:38.038 --> 00:39.772
I know.

00:39.773 --> 00:41.274
You've suffered brain damage

00:41.275 --> 00:43.810
and now we're asking people
to trust your perceptions.

00:43.811 --> 00:45.345
Yeah.

00:45.346 --> 00:48.515
Monday morning, go do a
full sensory reevaluation.

00:48.516 --> 00:50.217
Go to the spot.

00:50.218 --> 00:52.018
Do a full sensory recall.

00:52.019 --> 00:53.753
And if that's the way
you remember it,

00:53.754 --> 00:57.624
if you remember that he
pushed you, then that's that.

00:57.625 --> 01:00.793
Okay? We'll make sure
that they take your word.

01:00.794 --> 01:03.163
But you have to be certain.

01:03.164 --> 01:05.965
Because we want you to get
your word back, right?

01:05.966 --> 01:09.169
And after that, who knows,

01:09.170 --> 01:10.871
maybe you'll even laugh again.

01:12.673 --> 01:14.507
Hey...

01:14.508 --> 01:16.209
Yeah.

01:16.210 --> 01:18.645
You just did it.

01:18.646 --> 01:20.780
What time does this thing end?

01:20.781 --> 01:23.116
This duck hunt?

01:23.117 --> 01:24.151
In a few hours.

01:24.152 --> 01:25.818
What then?

01:25.819 --> 01:29.389
Then they go to
Luxembourg without me.

01:29.390 --> 01:31.090
Do you know what to do?

01:31.091 --> 01:33.793
What do you have to
take care of, still?

01:33.794 --> 01:36.529
I think Birdbath's okay.

01:36.530 --> 01:39.832
Um... Stephen.
Leslie. Paperwork.

01:39.833 --> 01:41.868
Okay.

01:41.869 --> 01:43.436
Icabod.

01:43.437 --> 01:45.705
What does he want?

01:45.706 --> 01:50.177
Um... I think I can probably
take care of that.

01:50.178 --> 01:52.812
Hey, John.

01:52.813 --> 01:55.849
It's time to kill some
birds for me, my man.

01:57.751 --> 01:59.319
How many?

01:59.320 --> 02:03.323
Well, how many bird is
the right amount to kill

02:03.324 --> 02:05.226
to turn a girl on?

02:07.127 --> 02:09.496
It depends on the girl probably.

02:09.497 --> 02:13.099
Yeah.

02:13.100 --> 02:14.967
Probably none.

02:14.968 --> 02:16.803
For most girls, I guess.

02:16.804 --> 02:18.839
Yeah.

02:20.174 --> 02:24.178
Eleven, I think, with her.

03:26.874 --> 03:29.008
Hey, John.

03:29.009 --> 03:32.144
Hi, Icabod.

03:32.145 --> 03:34.714
What'cha working at?

03:34.715 --> 03:35.883
Card tricks.

03:42.256 --> 03:44.392
Pick a card.

03:51.164 --> 03:53.367
Two of spades.

03:56.003 --> 03:58.539
Sorry, guy.

04:05.746 --> 04:08.014
John?

04:08.015 --> 04:10.082
Yeah?

04:10.083 --> 04:16.289
Sorry I came on so strong
with the liar business.

04:16.290 --> 04:19.257
Sometimes to get
people's attention,

04:19.259 --> 04:21.594
I have to play to my strengths

04:21.595 --> 04:26.334
which is to go a
little dark, I guess.

04:28.336 --> 04:31.505
I'm not an All-American Boy.

04:36.710 --> 04:42.815
I get the Headless
Horseman thing a lot.

04:42.816 --> 04:45.785
Dark grim thing.

04:45.786 --> 04:48.888
But actually I'm quite
light-hearted,

04:48.889 --> 04:53.427
tender and I enjoy
lots of contact.

05:01.669 --> 05:03.803
Cool.

05:03.804 --> 05:07.641
I'm not what meets the eye.

05:10.478 --> 05:13.112
Your resume?

05:13.113 --> 05:17.283
Penn? Army? Pentagon?

05:17.284 --> 05:19.251
Yeah.

05:19.252 --> 05:21.688
All-American Boy.

05:21.689 --> 05:24.757
Okay.

05:24.758 --> 05:27.894
You look like an
All-American Boy.

05:27.895 --> 05:29.463
Okay.

05:31.264 --> 05:33.866
But are you?

05:33.867 --> 05:40.940
You seem to be under an
unusual amount of stress.

05:40.941 --> 05:44.845
Maybe we're both struggling
with expectations.

05:48.749 --> 05:53.252
You lied on your resume, John.

05:53.253 --> 05:56.689
Didn't attend Penn.

05:56.690 --> 06:01.795
Maybe you're not quite
the All-American Boy,

06:03.997 --> 06:08.668
Not what meets the eye.

06:08.669 --> 06:12.505
Big whoop. Join the club.

06:12.506 --> 06:15.508
John, I'd like to embrace you

06:15.509 --> 06:17.143
and send you a
non-verbal message

06:17.144 --> 06:20.780
to you saying "I get you,
I know how you feel."

06:20.781 --> 06:26.520
You're just human.
Hello, Club Member."

06:28.889 --> 06:33.761
That's what cuddling's about.
I think you could use it.

06:40.100 --> 06:42.636
How does it work?

06:44.304 --> 06:46.973
You just come together.

06:46.974 --> 06:49.877
It's the easiest thing
in the world.

07:27.681 --> 07:30.518
How did you know
I didn't go to Penn?

07:31.785 --> 07:36.923
Class of '83. Alumni director.

07:36.924 --> 07:40.326
Shh.

07:40.327 --> 07:43.295
Allow human contact

07:43.296 --> 07:46.933
to release dopamine, seratonin,

07:46.934 --> 07:53.139
two hormones that
will fight your depression

07:53.140 --> 07:57.010
and really boost your mood.

08:14.928 --> 08:16.896
Wow.

08:16.897 --> 08:18.598
Okay.

08:18.599 --> 08:21.268
Hey, John?

08:26.106 --> 08:27.707
What's up?

08:27.708 --> 08:30.110
We have one more bird to kill.

08:34.715 --> 08:37.583
Yeah, so I don't know
what's going on.

08:37.585 --> 08:38.784
How many did you get?

08:38.785 --> 08:40.587
I got nothing.

08:40.587 --> 08:42.990
Eleven.

08:44.256 --> 08:47.393
Yeah, so, my cat's been
tired as shit lately.

08:47.394 --> 08:50.262
Your weapons cold and open?

08:50.263 --> 08:52.398
All right, let's head home.
Back to base.

08:52.399 --> 08:53.400
Hold them up.

08:54.401 --> 08:57.037
Now they come.

09:23.797 --> 09:28.335
Jesus fuck.

09:36.109 --> 09:37.645
Lakeman.

09:38.912 --> 09:42.282
You shot me in the fucking face!

09:44.584 --> 09:46.219
Sorry, Leslie.

09:50.023 --> 09:51.958
Boy, we're in the 11th hour here

09:51.959 --> 09:54.493
in regards to closing
this Denon deal.

09:54.494 --> 09:57.196
I was counting on
Leslie's expertise.

09:57.197 --> 09:59.531
And that's not going to happen.

09:59.532 --> 10:01.333
John?

10:01.334 --> 10:04.070
John, I guess you're
coming along to Luxembourg

10:04.071 --> 10:10.042
as you're the only one who's up
to speed on Leslie's Denon pitch.

10:10.043 --> 10:11.812
Welcome back.

10:14.381 --> 10:17.850
You deal with those last two
things, we're back on track.

10:17.851 --> 10:20.687
In Luxembourg a day before
you need to be.

10:20.688 --> 10:22.488
Before what?

10:22.489 --> 10:24.223
Before the little glass blower

10:24.224 --> 10:25.892
gets out of jail
and gets the bag back?

10:25.893 --> 10:27.994
Glass blower?

10:27.995 --> 10:29.729
Didn't you say the glass
blower's in jail

10:29.730 --> 10:31.430
and she's going to be given...

10:31.431 --> 10:33.165
Puppeteer, John.

10:33.166 --> 10:35.134
Okay.

10:35.135 --> 10:39.105
What's going on here?
You seem a little unfocused.

10:39.106 --> 10:40.807
I don't want you preparing
to go up against

10:40.808 --> 10:42.574
a glass blower when
you're going up against...

10:42.575 --> 10:45.444
It's probably...

10:45.445 --> 10:48.447
Is it that different?

10:48.448 --> 10:50.116
Well, I don't know.

10:50.117 --> 10:52.584
A puppeteer's probably easier.

10:52.585 --> 10:56.789
They live in small fragile
worlds of the imagination.

10:56.790 --> 10:59.792
Your glass blower has to go up
against the hard facts of life.

10:59.793 --> 11:02.128
Like things could
break at any moment.

11:02.129 --> 11:04.463
And... And they get very hot.

11:04.464 --> 11:06.432
Yeah.

11:06.433 --> 11:12.038
And John, so we should be
able to pull this off.

11:12.039 --> 11:14.440
We're at the end of
the troubled part of this.

11:14.441 --> 11:16.208
Let's get it back.

11:16.209 --> 11:18.244
It's only been a couple weeks.
We can get it back.

11:18.245 --> 11:23.382
All the important work is
right out there ahead of us.

11:23.383 --> 11:26.418
We need to make
a difference here.

11:26.419 --> 11:27.988
So let's go.

11:30.690 --> 11:33.359
- Yeah.
- Okay.

11:33.360 --> 11:35.494
So I was saying,
you get there the day

11:35.495 --> 11:36.963
before we take the bag back.

11:36.964 --> 11:39.066
Good, I can get some rest.

11:42.836 --> 11:45.405
You'll be killing
the physicist's wife.

11:54.848 --> 11:57.716
The other side is trying
to get this bag, too.

11:57.717 --> 12:00.187
I have to caution against that.

12:03.423 --> 12:05.524
She has a date at
the Bettborn train station

12:05.525 --> 12:07.193
with the bag,

12:07.194 --> 12:10.397
so we're going to caution
against them coming together.

12:14.734 --> 12:18.137
There's a reason
they sent her, John.

12:18.138 --> 12:20.039
Her husband's on a no fly.

12:20.040 --> 12:23.175
Worse comes to worst, she's
gone from the scenario,

12:23.176 --> 12:25.611
they have to find another way
to get the money to him.

12:25.612 --> 12:26.813
Buys us a couple weeks.

12:26.814 --> 12:30.049
So we're just buying time now?

12:30.050 --> 12:31.851
No, they're trying
to get the bag

12:31.852 --> 12:34.653
from A-to-B, too, John.

12:34.654 --> 12:36.555
And B is a bad place.

12:36.556 --> 12:38.959
B is an armed Iran.

12:42.395 --> 12:47.233
You shouldn't
be uncertain about that

12:47.234 --> 12:50.070
if you're uncertain about that.

12:53.807 --> 12:56.043
I have to go.

12:59.612 --> 13:01.448
Are you okay?

15:14.647 --> 15:17.116
You can stand on a piano
all you want I guess,

15:17.117 --> 15:19.585
But if you don't
look both ways...

15:19.586 --> 15:21.420
Yeah.

15:21.421 --> 15:23.022
We're a couple men down here,

15:23.023 --> 15:26.192
So John, on this
last push here with Denon,

15:26.193 --> 15:27.994
you're taking lead.

15:27.995 --> 15:29.161
Shit.

15:29.162 --> 15:32.831
What's that? Did you say "shit"?

15:32.832 --> 15:35.434
No, I said you can count on me.

15:35.435 --> 15:38.470
Okay. Cool.

15:38.471 --> 15:40.506
Yeah, John can't go.

15:40.507 --> 15:41.740
What?

15:41.741 --> 15:42.908
- John.
- Yeah.

15:42.909 --> 15:44.143
- Can't go.
- Why?

15:44.144 --> 15:46.112
His paperwork situation.

15:46.113 --> 15:47.513
What situation?

15:47.514 --> 15:49.948
Well, he doesn't
technically work here.

15:49.949 --> 15:52.084
I put Sure Shot back
on the travel squad.

15:52.085 --> 15:53.952
I'm calling you Sure Shot now.

15:53.953 --> 15:55.354
Okay.

15:55.355 --> 15:56.788
Well, Sure Shot
doesn't work here.

15:56.789 --> 15:58.557
I can't process his paperwork.

15:58.558 --> 16:01.693
Today was the deadline on
the supplemental material.

16:01.694 --> 16:03.662
Not yet received.

16:03.663 --> 16:06.798
Sure Shot can't travel
or actually even be

16:06.799 --> 16:11.970
on this premises in any regard
other than "visitor" now.

16:11.971 --> 16:13.972
Due to liabilities.

16:13.973 --> 16:16.376
One too many digits.

16:19.146 --> 16:23.716
I can't mess with H.R.,
Sure Shot. Sorry.

17:16.069 --> 17:21.373
John Lakeman, supplemental
tax paperwork.

17:21.374 --> 17:22.840
Did you like that driving?

17:22.842 --> 17:24.643
Cool driving.

17:24.644 --> 17:25.644
Yeah, it was cool.

17:25.645 --> 17:27.113
I'm not even trained
at that either.

17:27.114 --> 17:28.314
Fucking pulled it out.

17:28.315 --> 17:29.981
Jesus, my legs are like Jell-O.

17:29.982 --> 17:31.350
- Chair?
- Not yet, not yet.

17:31.351 --> 17:34.019
Lakeman locks down
the paperwork.

17:34.020 --> 17:36.855
Who's that guy?

17:36.856 --> 17:37.856
My husband.

17:37.857 --> 17:39.358
Hey, John.

17:39.359 --> 17:40.526
Yeah.

17:40.527 --> 17:41.727
- Hang on.
- You're my husband.

17:41.728 --> 17:44.463
Okay. What?

17:44.464 --> 17:48.867
I just, whenever I think
about that, I feel so lucky.

17:48.868 --> 17:50.336
And I just say it.

17:50.337 --> 17:54.173
Okay, well, I have to
tell you something, honey.

17:54.174 --> 17:57.443
Regarding... The task that

17:57.444 --> 17:58.910
we've been working on.

17:58.911 --> 18:00.045
Could I have a word with you?

18:00.046 --> 18:01.313
I have your information.

18:01.314 --> 18:03.515
We're running late, guy.
Maybe text it.

18:03.516 --> 18:05.384
I'm not permitted to do that.

18:05.385 --> 18:10.389
I'm not allowed
to write anything down.

18:10.390 --> 18:11.523
John doesn't allow you to?

18:11.524 --> 18:14.560
No. He likes my voice.

18:14.561 --> 18:17.696
Cool. You have a nice voice.

18:17.697 --> 18:18.897
You do.

18:18.898 --> 18:20.199
Thanks.

18:20.200 --> 18:21.200
Ron. Fuck. I have to go.

18:21.201 --> 18:22.201
Just tell me.

18:22.202 --> 18:23.869
Okay... Asi-

18:23.870 --> 18:25.137
Yeah.

18:25.138 --> 18:26.538
- Puppe-Got it.
- Two PM. Tomorrow.

18:26.539 --> 18:28.807
Asi puppe fly fly
away from her cage.

18:28.808 --> 18:31.277
Will have, most likely,
the red thing you need.

18:31.278 --> 18:33.979
Big dark beard man
also there 2 p.m.

18:33.980 --> 18:35.281
for red thing.

18:35.282 --> 18:38.684
- Got it.
- Also jujitsu airport bro

18:38.685 --> 18:43.455
started checking Milwaukee
flight passenger lists again.

18:43.456 --> 18:45.924
So eyes out for jujitsu.

18:45.925 --> 18:47.659
Got it, honey?

18:47.660 --> 18:50.296
Yeah, thanks, honey.

18:50.297 --> 18:52.265
Safe trip.

19:06.012 --> 19:07.279
Eddie.

19:07.280 --> 19:09.816
Yeah?

19:12.219 --> 19:13.920
Does John kill people?

19:20.260 --> 19:21.527
Eddie...

19:21.528 --> 19:23.496
No way.

19:26.499 --> 19:29.302
I know what she's investigating.

19:32.672 --> 19:33.739
It's murder.

19:33.740 --> 19:36.174
- She's wrong.
- She's smart.

19:36.175 --> 19:38.444
She's wrong.

19:38.445 --> 19:41.381
My dad'll be able to explain it.

19:45.918 --> 19:48.220
Yeah?

19:48.221 --> 19:49.722
Yeah, what?

19:51.658 --> 19:54.793
Your dad will be able
to explain it?

19:54.794 --> 19:56.595
Yeah... Come on. Yeah.

19:56.596 --> 20:01.267
Dad wouldn't ask him to do that.

20:01.268 --> 20:03.168
Why wouldn't he?

20:03.169 --> 20:05.904
Because that's too much.

20:05.905 --> 20:07.940
To ask.

24:24.063 --> 24:28.100
I'd like to ask you a few
questions about Mikham Candahar.

24:34.941 --> 24:39.945
He floated up from the river,
dead from the river,

24:39.946 --> 24:43.650
with your address, handwritten,
in his coat pocket.

28:57.870 --> 29:00.438
What is this?

29:00.439 --> 29:03.074
Saline.

29:03.075 --> 29:04.142
And?

29:04.143 --> 29:06.744
And morphine For the pain.

29:06.745 --> 29:10.048
Morphine.

29:10.049 --> 29:12.583
Let me ask you a question.

29:12.584 --> 29:15.988
Not in an angry fashion.

29:18.024 --> 29:22.127
While a man is unconscious,

29:22.128 --> 29:28.099
is it S.O.P to fill him
with powerful drugs

29:28.100 --> 29:31.702
without checking his
chemical history?

29:31.703 --> 29:34.472
Is that S.O.P?

29:34.473 --> 29:36.674
It is when they've
been shot in the face.

29:36.675 --> 29:38.609
Would you like it removed?

29:38.610 --> 29:39.978
It feels...

29:39.979 --> 29:41.447
I'm sorry?

29:43.515 --> 29:45.251
It feels like...

29:46.452 --> 29:51.056
It feels like one
might expect it to feel

29:51.057 --> 29:56.527
if they, say, were

29:56.528 --> 29:59.298
flying on a magic carpet.

30:00.566 --> 30:01.834
Would you like it removed?

30:04.403 --> 30:07.373
Your phone's been ringing
for the last ten hours.

30:18.250 --> 30:19.484
Hello?

30:19.485 --> 30:22.520
Mr. Claret?

30:22.521 --> 30:23.821
Yes.

30:23.822 --> 30:25.323
This is Detective Albans

30:25.324 --> 30:26.824
from the Luxembourg City Police.

30:26.825 --> 30:28.526
I have a question.

30:28.527 --> 30:31.729
A subsequent question
about John Lakeman.

30:31.730 --> 30:33.698
The asshole.

30:33.699 --> 30:37.869
Yes.

30:37.870 --> 30:40.071
The young asshole.

30:40.072 --> 30:42.875
Do you have a moment?

30:44.343 --> 30:46.144
Yes.

30:46.145 --> 30:48.246
Mr. Claret, you
mentioned John Lakeman

30:48.247 --> 30:51.182
missed a dinner on May 11th,
to retrieve a bag.

30:51.183 --> 30:54.019
I never asked you...

30:54.020 --> 30:58.424
Did he return with the bag?

31:02.094 --> 31:04.996
Got your little suit back?

31:04.997 --> 31:07.198
You're 40 minutes late.

31:07.199 --> 31:09.267
They sent my bag
to the wrong hotel.

31:09.268 --> 31:12.938
- Yes.
- Yes, he did?

31:12.939 --> 31:15.440
Yes, he did.

31:15.441 --> 31:18.143
The asshole.

31:18.144 --> 31:19.744
If you recall, Mr. Claret,

31:19.745 --> 31:22.647
what color was this bag?

31:22.648 --> 31:24.749
Red-ish.

31:24.750 --> 31:26.352
Garment bag.

31:28.754 --> 31:31.689
Red-ish.

31:31.690 --> 31:34.060
Thank you.

31:42.401 --> 31:43.901
What are you...
What are you doing?

31:43.902 --> 31:45.703
Removing your morphine drip.

31:45.704 --> 31:47.838
Well, let's not be hasty.

31:47.839 --> 31:50.542
How about it?

31:53.779 --> 31:56.015
I'm flying here.

32:17.036 --> 32:20.406
I... I'm... I'm just asking...

32:22.874 --> 32:24.310
Yeah?

32:29.715 --> 32:30.716
What?

32:32.251 --> 32:35.321
Does Dad ask you
to kill people, John?

32:48.300 --> 32:51.370
I'm killing a
woman at 3 A.M. tonight.

32:56.308 --> 32:57.709
Do you want to help me?

33:03.015 --> 33:05.084
Of course not.

33:08.487 --> 33:11.090
Then what help are you, man?

33:39.818 --> 33:43.789
This is a song about
somebody I killed.

37:36.655 --> 37:38.556
If I want your opinion,
I'll ask for it.

37:38.557 --> 37:39.557
Fuck your rules,
this concerns John.

37:39.558 --> 37:40.958
I'm putting my foot down.

37:40.959 --> 37:42.593
Fuck your foot. I should
be at home with Efram,

37:42.594 --> 37:44.194
instead of helping you do
this fucking shit.

37:44.195 --> 37:45.364
Well, stop!

37:55.974 --> 37:58.075
Hey.

37:58.076 --> 37:59.310
Hey.

37:59.311 --> 38:00.979
How are you?

38:02.748 --> 38:05.015
The doctors couldn't
find anything wrong.

38:05.016 --> 38:08.786
I mean you took a hell of
a wallop but they said

38:08.787 --> 38:09.887
there were no...

38:09.888 --> 38:12.256
Nothing's broken, nothing's...

38:12.257 --> 38:14.291
Yeah, I'm okay.

38:14.292 --> 38:17.362
No. No, you're not all right..

38:17.363 --> 38:18.829
What time is it?

38:18.830 --> 38:20.998
It's lay down.
That's what fucking time it is.

38:20.999 --> 38:22.933
It's 1:35.

38:22.934 --> 38:24.201
I'm okay.

38:24.202 --> 38:26.170
Just stay there, John.

38:26.171 --> 38:28.573
Are you really unhurt?

38:28.574 --> 38:31.075
Because the girl gets
out in 25 minutes.

38:31.076 --> 38:32.142
With the bag...

38:32.143 --> 38:33.811
Lay down. Just lay there, John.

38:33.812 --> 38:36.280
So you're saying
you're okay. Are you okay?

38:36.281 --> 38:41.352
Because you didn't do the thing that
you were instructed to do last night

38:41.353 --> 38:46.056
and she'll be waiting at the
Bettborn train station for that bag.

38:46.057 --> 38:47.792
You can take it before then.

38:47.793 --> 38:51.161
I can't do it.
And he can't do it.

38:51.162 --> 38:54.665
You know what, fuck you.

38:54.666 --> 38:55.901
John...

38:59.805 --> 39:01.639
I'm often told not
to do something

39:01.640 --> 39:03.908
which I'm then expected
to do anyway.

39:03.909 --> 39:06.377
I was told not to do this.

39:06.378 --> 39:09.313
This task. Of ours.

39:09.314 --> 39:11.849
I was prohibited.

39:11.850 --> 39:13.951
And I'm expected to anyway.

39:13.952 --> 39:16.153
So if this gets exposed,

39:16.154 --> 39:19.356
then, well, son, I'm exposed.

39:19.357 --> 39:21.426
What I'm saying, John,

39:21.427 --> 39:23.327
this came unraveled.

39:23.328 --> 39:24.862
Quickly.

39:24.863 --> 39:27.598
And we dug in a little too deep.

39:27.599 --> 39:30.701
If it doesn't get
right back on track

39:30.702 --> 39:34.806
then I could go to jail.

39:49.555 --> 39:51.456
I'm all right.

39:51.457 --> 39:53.491
You were hit by a car. Lay down.

39:53.492 --> 39:55.292
John can speak
for himself, Edward.

39:55.293 --> 39:57.462
Yeah? Can he?

39:57.463 --> 39:59.564
Eddie, I'm fine.
She's a glass blower.

39:59.565 --> 40:01.532
A puppeteer.

40:01.533 --> 40:03.801
Either way.

40:03.802 --> 40:06.303
Wait, you're really all right?

40:06.304 --> 40:09.107
I'm fucking fine. Stop.

40:10.609 --> 40:12.677
You going to get her?

40:12.678 --> 40:14.945
Yeah, I'm going.

40:14.946 --> 40:17.015
Then hurry.

43:55.566 --> 43:57.567
Hey.

43:57.568 --> 44:01.205
Excuse me.

44:01.206 --> 44:03.307
Hello.

44:03.308 --> 44:04.709
Hello.

44:04.710 --> 44:05.710
That's my bag.

44:05.711 --> 44:07.044
Which?

44:07.045 --> 44:10.415
The red one. It belongs to me.

44:37.976 --> 44:41.779
Where's the, um...

44:41.780 --> 44:45.884
I left it back there.
In the police building.

44:48.186 --> 44:49.419
The money?

44:49.420 --> 44:51.055
Yes.

44:51.056 --> 44:53.758
Why?

44:53.759 --> 44:56.160
It's heavy.

44:56.161 --> 44:58.829
Why did you take the bag?

44:58.830 --> 45:01.398
I need to make a sunrise.

45:01.399 --> 45:03.033
For my new show.

45:03.034 --> 45:05.035
My show of marionettes.

45:05.036 --> 45:07.772
It's specifically
the right color.

45:07.773 --> 45:10.841
For that.

45:10.842 --> 45:13.211
You didn't want the money?

45:15.280 --> 45:17.314
No.

45:17.315 --> 45:19.717
You just wanted the bag?

45:21.419 --> 45:22.821
Yes.

45:25.223 --> 45:27.691
Okay.

45:27.692 --> 45:30.660
So, where's the money now?

45:30.661 --> 45:33.831
I left it in a simple
carefree style

45:33.832 --> 45:36.802
on the dresser in
the ladies' police room.

45:39.905 --> 45:42.740
I like your music.

45:48.746 --> 45:50.580
My friend gave it to me.

45:50.581 --> 45:53.750
She cared little for it.

45:53.751 --> 45:57.421
I'm so sorry.

45:57.422 --> 46:00.825
No, it's cool, you can't...

46:00.826 --> 46:03.127
you know, please all people.

46:03.128 --> 46:06.163
May I use one of
your songs for my show?

46:06.164 --> 46:10.067
Yeah. Which one? Can I...?

46:10.068 --> 46:12.202
"Circles of Resonance".

46:12.203 --> 46:14.371
Why?

46:14.372 --> 46:19.476
I just like it.
You can't even move yourself,

46:19.477 --> 46:22.479
just from here-to-there

46:22.480 --> 46:28.186
because nothing and
no one is straight.

46:30.055 --> 46:34.258
Why do you like that?

46:34.259 --> 46:38.996
Because I steal shit all
the time for my puppet show.

46:38.997 --> 46:42.099
And it makes me feel less bad

46:42.100 --> 46:46.003
for not being a
perfect citizen, I guess.

46:46.004 --> 46:50.841
Well, no-one's a perfect, um...

46:50.842 --> 46:52.477
citizen, probably.

46:54.412 --> 46:56.413
Are you okay?

46:56.414 --> 46:59.083
You don't look well.

46:59.084 --> 47:01.852
I got hit by a car recently.

47:01.853 --> 47:04.121
Wow. Why don't you rest?

47:04.122 --> 47:06.623
I'm doing something

47:06.624 --> 47:08.792
for work just now.

47:08.793 --> 47:11.661
As a musician, you'd
think that would have

47:11.662 --> 47:14.564
a more laid-back lifestyle.

47:14.565 --> 47:16.367
I'm not a musician.

47:17.668 --> 47:20.270
Why not?

47:20.271 --> 47:22.940
I guess when I was
a kid my dad told me

47:22.941 --> 47:25.943
it was a kind of hard life.

47:25.944 --> 47:30.147
You have to sleep
in vans and stuff.

47:30.148 --> 47:34.886
So... anyway, he
suggested something else.

47:36.955 --> 47:42.060
So you do puppets?
That's kind of cool.

47:43.528 --> 47:47.432
Yeah, it is cool.

47:49.200 --> 47:51.768
So the money is just
sitting on the dresser.

47:51.769 --> 47:54.872
Yeah. Next to the lion.

48:09.454 --> 48:10.955
See you.

48:10.956 --> 48:12.890
See you.

48:34.779 --> 48:35.980
Yeah. What?

48:35.981 --> 48:38.648
The police station.
Now, Dennis. Go now.

48:38.649 --> 48:39.649
Cause a distraction.

48:39.650 --> 48:40.985
How?

48:40.986 --> 48:42.920
I don't know, man.
You got to go now.

49:31.536 --> 49:33.803
Excuse me.

49:33.804 --> 49:37.641
Um, I'd like to file a report.

49:37.642 --> 49:39.576
Um, I was mugged.

49:39.577 --> 49:42.946
Um, they took everything,
except my glasses.

49:42.947 --> 49:45.582
I don't think they wanted
me to give chase, as it were.

49:45.583 --> 49:46.950
Um...

49:46.951 --> 49:49.719
But I think that
I should file a report.

49:49.720 --> 49:51.755
Or something.

49:51.756 --> 49:56.260
To whomever.

49:56.261 --> 49:59.064
And while I'm here I wouldn't
mind paying some parking tickets.

50:00.331 --> 50:02.766
Hi. It's a beautiful building.

50:02.767 --> 50:05.070
Must be, like, 100 years old?

52:12.263 --> 52:15.064
This is the train you take

52:15.065 --> 52:17.268
when you're trying
to get out of town.

52:19.370 --> 52:22.906
Bettborn station.

52:22.907 --> 52:23.908
Yes.

52:30.415 --> 52:32.317
Wherever you're going...

52:36.020 --> 52:37.954
you're not going to be able
to get from here-to-there

52:37.955 --> 52:40.458
as easily as you think.

52:44.229 --> 52:46.897
Why don't you just take
the bag from me now?

52:55.373 --> 52:58.208
You read my note.

52:58.209 --> 53:00.511
And the terms appeal to you.
That's why.

53:03.714 --> 53:06.850
I don't know
exactly who you are,

53:06.851 --> 53:10.487
but I know what you do.

53:10.488 --> 53:12.757
And I know you are sad.

53:23.133 --> 53:25.670
My train's coming.

53:27.238 --> 53:31.441
If you let me board,
you can leave here,

53:31.442 --> 53:35.078
these things you've been
doing that make you sad, John.

53:35.079 --> 53:37.547
Whatever is burdening you.

53:37.548 --> 53:40.785
And go wherever else you'd like.

53:42.186 --> 53:45.222
And nothing that you did
here will follow.
