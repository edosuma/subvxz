00:09.421 --> 00:10.501
Fez…

00:11.375 --> 00:13.364
I didn’t say anything when you
started spying on Donna...

00:14.092 --> 00:17.282
I kept my mouth shut when you hid
in the dirty towel bin to peep on
the cheerleaders...

00:19.281 --> 00:21.655
But if you get your jollies listening
to people go potty…

00:23.036 --> 00:24.811
I’m calling a doctor.

00:25.397 --> 00:29.750
Shhh, I’m trying to see if Jackie’s okay.
She’s been in the bathroom for hours, crying.

00:31.389 --> 00:32.564
Oh my God !

00:32.969 --> 00:34.738
You had sex with her !

00:35.337 --> 00:36.531
No !

00:36.912 --> 00:39.234
She told me she wanted to be
my girlfriend and I turned her down.

00:39.627 --> 00:40.786
What ? Why ?

00:40.786 --> 00:42.378
Because she didn’t mean it.

00:42.378 --> 00:44.187
She never wanted me before.

00:44.911 --> 00:47.314
And now that she’s desperate,
suddenly I’m the guy for her.

00:49.087 --> 00:51.271
But as soon as she’s happy,
she’ll dump me.

00:51.753 --> 00:53.922
So I told her to get lost and now
she’s in tears.

00:56.396 --> 00:58.480
Well, what kind of crying is it ?
Is it like...

00:59.251 --> 01:00.942
"my life is over" kinda crying or...

01:01.375 --> 01:04.113
...hysterical sobbing like the time
Kelso sat on his nads ?

01:06.798 --> 01:10.000
No it’s bad. I tried everything
to get her out. I yelled "Fire !"...

01:10.237 --> 01:16.690
I made monkey-noises and said
"Wow that’s a gigantic monkey".

01:18.753 --> 01:21.817
But no luck. She must be
a complete wreck.

01:23.362 --> 01:24.943
Oh hey guys !

01:25.361 --> 01:29.305
Oh. She’s perfectly fine. So you definitely
didn’t have sex with her.

01:31.691 --> 01:32.900
Jackie, you’re okay ?

01:32.900 --> 01:34.535
Oh no.
No I’m not okay.

01:34.929 --> 01:37.127
I just decided being sad is
a waste of time.

01:37.523 --> 01:40.536
You see, a more productive use
of my time is revenge.

01:41.517 --> 01:42.581
So get ready.

01:43.034 --> 01:49.127
Because I am going to rain doom
down on your stupid foreign head !

01:55.337 --> 01:57.426
That didn’t seem so bad Fez.
I wouldn’t worry about it.

01:59.944 --> 02:01.494
- You wouldn’t ?
- No.

02:01.816 --> 02:03.035
That’s because I’m safe.

02:05.036 --> 02:07.066
You should be freakin’ terrified.

02:11.056 --> 02:14.414

02:47.929 --> 02:51.151
Hey hey ! Just got back from Florida.

02:51.851 --> 02:53.242
Wanna see my tan lines ?

02:56.471 --> 02:58.182
Oh, for gosh sakes, Bob !

02:58.689 --> 03:01.715
Joke's on you ! I don't got no tan lines !
Whoohoo !

03:07.518 --> 03:08.753
You were in Florida ?

03:09.754 --> 03:11.806
Yeah, I was gone for three weeks.
You didn’t notice ?

03:14.465 --> 03:16.649
I just figured my migraine medicine
was working.

03:18.347 --> 03:21.268
Uhuh. Boy it was beautiful
down there.

03:22.065 --> 03:27.378
The ocean, the sunshine and Disneyworld
is a great place to pick up single moms.

03:29.682 --> 03:33.754
In fact, I like Florida so much I’m
selling the house and I’m moving there.

03:34.963 --> 03:36.662
You’re selling your house ?!

03:37.399 --> 03:39.163
What if someone annoying moves in ?!

03:41.854 --> 03:44.598
I bought a condo.
And get ready for this...

03:45.379 --> 03:47.286
I’m gonna open a bait shop.

03:48.786 --> 03:50.603
What a great idea...

03:52.256 --> 03:56.567
That way, when the hundreds of other
bait shops down there run out of stock,
there you’ll be !

03:57.903 --> 04:00.558
So, you think I'm stupid because
I want to open a bait shop ?

04:00.658 --> 04:02.257
No, of course not !

04:02.599 --> 04:05.036
I think you want to open a bait shop
because you're stupid.

04:07.152 --> 04:09.633
Well, I didn't come in here
to be ridiculed.

04:10.401 --> 04:12.540
Then you shouldn't have worn
that shirt !

04:15.682 --> 04:18.192
Red, you need to go over there
and apologize to Bob.

04:18.192 --> 04:22.544
He came here all excitd about his idea
and you just made him feel bad about himself.

04:23.351 --> 04:25.778
Yeah, he never saw it coming.

04:28.970 --> 04:32.440
So did you get Jackie back for flushing
your tootbrush down the toilet ?

04:34.161 --> 04:38.783
No. Only four out of five dentists
recommend brushing, so I just go
to the other guy.

04:40.518 --> 04:42.567
How about for micro-waving
your hand-lotion ?

04:43.912 --> 04:45.495
No, the heat feels nice on my...

04:51.586 --> 04:52.806
...hands.

04:54.002 --> 04:56.492
Well, what are you gonna do to her
for ripping all of the buttons of your shirt?

04:57.037 --> 04:58.839
Thank her.
I look fabulous !

05:00.503 --> 05:01.911
Man, what is wrong with you ?

05:02.370 --> 05:05.787
She tore your shirt for easy access,
when Jackie gets angry, she goes
straight for the nipple.

05:07.253 --> 05:10.929
Hyde, I turned her down, she has
every right to be angry.

05:11.682 --> 05:14.666
But the worst of it is over, so I’m
gonna let bygones be bygones.

05:15.426 --> 05:17.957
Fez, let me tell you a little story.

05:18.944 --> 05:21.382
Once upon a time there was a
young girl named Jackie.

05:22.225 --> 05:25.181
She destroyed everything in her path
cause she was Satan’s child.

05:28.414 --> 05:29.495
The end !

05:30.625 --> 05:33.101
Ahhh, I see your point.

05:34.851 --> 05:36.444
Wait, what’s your point ?

05:37.614 --> 05:41.384
My point is she’s evil man ! You gotta
get back at her, you gotta fight fire with fire.

05:41.678 --> 05:44.994
Are you suggesting I set her on fire ?!
What has happened to you ?

05:48.991 --> 05:52.194
I’m just saying that every time Jackie
hurts you, you gotta hurt her worse.

05:52.194 --> 05:54.682
I don’t know, that sounds like a
senseless cycle of violence.

05:55.287 --> 05:57.427
Yeah. That’s the best and funniest kind.

05:59.214 --> 06:02.510
Look this whole thing will blow over
once I talk to her about everything.

06:04.277 --> 06:06.217
Holy crap !

06:09.652 --> 06:12.248
My car !
Jackie ruined my car !

06:14.134 --> 06:15.710
And you don’t have insurance.

06:16.311 --> 06:17.912
Haha ! Good one, Jackie.

06:19.726 --> 06:22.897
And look what she wrote on
the side. Fez has a tiny...

06:23.466 --> 06:25.257
I do not !

06:29.132 --> 06:31.717
It's perfectly normal based on all
the other ones I've seen.

06:34.385 --> 06:36.186
I only look for comparison !

06:40.196 --> 06:42.382
Well, if Jackie wants war,
I'll give her war.

06:43.710 --> 06:45.289
Whatever you say, Tiny.

06:48.119 --> 06:51.352
If it's so small, why would I name it
Big John ?

06:57.489 --> 06:59.788
Dad I don’t wanna move to Florida.

07:00.224 --> 07:02.200
- Sure you do !
- No I don’t !

07:02.834 --> 07:06.460
- C'mon, who doesn't want to move
to Florida ? - Me !

07:07.275 --> 07:10.803
Oh. Well, geez, you should have said
that before I put the house on the market.

07:11.103 --> 07:12.884
You put the house on the market ?

07:13.146 --> 07:14.615
Relax, honey, I can always take it off.

07:14.818 --> 07:16.802
- You can ?
- No, it sold this morning.

07:22.427 --> 07:23.489
Well look who it is.

07:24.769 --> 07:26.711
Come over to insult me again ?
I don’t know, maybe...

07:27.201 --> 07:29.293
...take another cheap shot
at my outfit ?

07:29.583 --> 07:31.929
Okay. There is nothing wrong
with your outfits.

07:32.761 --> 07:36.210
Red thinks they’re tacky but I’ve
explained to him that you’re just Italian.

07:38.584 --> 07:41.789
Anyway, Red has something he’d like
to say to you. Go ahead.

07:43.698 --> 07:47.449
Bob. I’m sorry that I said that
your idea is stupid.

07:48.350 --> 07:49.615
- And…
- And…

07:51.960 --> 07:55.540
...the next time you have a stupid idea
I’ll just keep my mouth shut.

07:57.699 --> 07:58.731
You know what Red ?

07:59.733 --> 08:01.490
I really don’t give a damn
what you think.

08:02.366 --> 08:05.154
All these years I’d have to put up
with you cutting me down...

08:05.460 --> 08:08.744
...calling me dumb-ass, well guess
what, you're the dumb-ass !

08:09.727 --> 08:13.306
You’re nothing but a cranky *bleep*
who thinks he’s *bleep* his dogsday...

08:13.554 --> 08:15.931
...so you can blow it out your *bleep*
ass !

08:16.930 --> 08:20.806
What, what, what you wanna hit me ?
Go ahead you bald *bleep*...

08:25.370 --> 08:31.212
Yeah go ahead, do it, I’m not afraid of
you, in fact, I’ll kick your boney *bleep*
ass right now !

08:39.765 --> 08:41.993
Bob, you’ve got some nerve !

08:44.401 --> 08:45.800
Good for you !

08:46.608 --> 08:50.200
It’s about time you stuck up for
yourself and acted like a man.

08:51.993 --> 08:54.400
I’m sorry Red it just slipped out !

08:56.276 --> 08:57.265
I’m so sorry Fez.

08:57.791 --> 09:00.296
- I was just outside and I read that you
have a tiny…- Shut it !

09:03.029 --> 09:06.560
Fez, you gotta do something man.
Because Jackie is just getting started.

09:07.525 --> 09:10.156
When she gets mad, she is like
a revenge machine.

09:10.594 --> 09:12.745
She will destroy you because
she can !

09:14.264 --> 09:17.701
Get out man ! I gotta get out !
I gotta get out !...

09:19.763 --> 09:21.457
Huh… flashback…

09:24.864 --> 09:27.356
Vandalizing your car man ?
That’s disturbed.

09:27.356 --> 09:30.155
I mean that car is the only thing that
defines you as a man.

09:30.449 --> 09:32.827
- You know, because you have such
a tiny…- Enough !

09:36.342 --> 09:39.558
I gotta get back at her. Oh I know,
I’ll break her TV.

09:40.986 --> 09:43.112
Ahhh but then I’ll just miss Gilligan.

09:46.716 --> 09:49.653
If you’re gonna retaliate, you need
to hit Jackie where it hurts.

09:50.357 --> 09:52.160
Ahhh, like in the face ?

09:54.406 --> 09:57.422
No ! What does Jackie love
the most ?

09:57.999 --> 10:00.498
Herself. All she cares about
is her looks.

10:01.048 --> 10:02.468
You’re exactly right.

10:02.722 --> 10:04.781
I’m gonna buy some bleach and
some razor blades...

10:04.781 --> 10:07.824
and after I do my laundry and shave,
I’ll think of what to do to Jackie.

10:11.873 --> 10:13.251
You guys are never going
to believe this.

10:13.969 --> 10:15.999
My Dad is moving to Florida.

10:16.592 --> 10:18.489
Florida is nice. My Mom spend
three years down there.

10:19.466 --> 10:21.554
Supposed to be five but she got
time off for good behaviour.

10:24.115 --> 10:26.084
I’ve got no place to live !
What am I gonna do ?

10:26.937 --> 10:28.367
Why don’t you move in with me ?

10:34.459 --> 10:36.530
Donna ? Randy asked you
a question.

10:38.093 --> 10:40.904
And I for one am giddy with anticipation
to hear the answer.

10:42.124 --> 10:45.046
I just meant, we’re dating and
I’ve got the room...

10:45.438 --> 10:49.187
and if you got homesick I could walk
around naked with my robe open
like your Dad.

10:51.438 --> 10:53.627
I don’t know, I mean I never really
thought about moving in.

10:54.868 --> 10:57.929
I mean we hardly…
well I do need a place to live…

10:58.306 --> 11:01.564
but you don’t want me invading…
well we do watch the same shows…

11:03.646 --> 11:05.335
What the hell, sure !

11:06.501 --> 11:08.720
Then what the hell sure it is !

11:14.125 --> 11:15.691
Jackie is about to get out
of the bathroom.

11:16.035 --> 11:17.282
Wait until you see what I did to her.

11:17.876 --> 11:21.616
Fez, if this is the ex-lax prank,
I’d rather hear about it then see it.

11:25.581 --> 11:26.909
No it’s better.

11:29.063 --> 11:31.096
And she’s turning the shower off…

11:32.244 --> 11:34.338
she’s getting out…

11:35.815 --> 11:37.474
look at herself in the mirror and…

11:37.836 --> 11:39.650
AAAARRRGGHHHH !

11:41.396 --> 11:42.712
FEZ !

11:45.192 --> 11:47.282
Ho ho ho, Green Jackie !

11:48.349 --> 11:50.838
Fez, you completely ruined my hair !

11:51.252 --> 11:52.535
You destroyed my car !

11:52.535 --> 11:55.380
I had every right to destroy your car,
you turned me down !

11:55.756 --> 11:58.604
You turned me down like a million times
and I never did anything !

12:01.192 --> 12:02.819
Actually I remember a lot of crying.

12:04.019 --> 12:07.347
Yes I cried. Because I have feelings.
Unlike you Jackie.

12:08.100 --> 12:10.378
Oh, huhuh.
I have feelings.

12:10.630 --> 12:13.211
And they told me to buy a bottle of
spray paint and tell the whole world...

12:13.211 --> 12:16.027
- ...that you have a tiny…
- IT’S NORMAL SIZED !

12:19.071 --> 12:21.082
Well you know what, I’m glad
I turned you down.

12:21.413 --> 12:22.869
Because you are a mean, bitter girl.

12:23.256 --> 12:26.840
And now, you’re ugly on the outside
like you are ugly in the inside.

12:28.348 --> 12:30.508
Holy crap man, cover your nipples !

12:33.099 --> 12:34.944
I can’t believe that’s what
you really think of me.

12:35.289 --> 12:36.445
Well it is.

12:37.372 --> 12:41.432
Fine. I’ll just go pack up my things
and get out of your life.

12:48.632 --> 12:50.031
Damn man, that was harsh.

12:51.663 --> 12:53.662
Yeah. Must have been my
Jamaican fire.

12:56.366 --> 12:58.571
So… you’re from Jamaica ?

12:59.571 --> 13:02.006
No, "Jamaican Fire".
It’s my new cologne.

13:09.596 --> 13:15.118
See, these blue buildings are condo’s
and the green ones those are cabana’s.

13:15.705 --> 13:16.847
What is that yellow building ?

13:17.338 --> 13:19.722
Oh that’s CheeseWhiz,
I was reading in bed.

13:23.036 --> 13:27.463
Wow. This design is great. You know,
the way these condo’s are layed out...

13:27.800 --> 13:32.691
you could spend your entire life and
never have to interact with your idiot neighbours.

13:34.003 --> 13:35.973
Oh, and look at the streetnames...

13:36.430 --> 13:39.149
Orange Grove Avenue, Grapefruit Lane,
Pineapple Road,

13:39.403 --> 13:41.536
it’s like living in a fruit salad !

13:42.715 --> 13:46.810
Anyway, I couldn’t help but notice they
got 200 brand new beachfront homes...

13:47.128 --> 13:49.974
each with a dock, but no bait shop
within five miles.

13:50.619 --> 13:52.364
You can fish of your own pier ?

13:53.403 --> 13:55.445
That means you don’t have to get
your lines tangled up...

13:55.726 --> 13:58.223
with some dumb-ass who doesn’t
know what they’re doing ?

13:59.695 --> 14:01.621
You’re the one who invited me !

14:03.437 --> 14:05.745
Ah, you guys should move
down there too.

14:07.008 --> 14:10.100
Red, Red, you could run the bait shop
with me.

14:10.442 --> 14:12.411
Nah, I don’t think so Bob.

14:12.998 --> 14:14.977
Kitty and I aren’t ready to leave
Point Place.

14:15.599 --> 14:18.748
Okay then. When I’m sitting pretty
there on Orange Grove Avenue...

14:19.353 --> 14:22.621
you guys can enjoy the drive past
Slaughterhouse Way.

14:23.866 --> 14:25.225
Well that’s not fair Bob.

14:25.695 --> 14:28.849
It’s only named that because that way
leads to the slaughterhouse.

14:32.228 --> 14:34.041
I think you really gonna like
living here.

14:34.559 --> 14:35.749
So let’s take the tour, shall we ?

14:36.194 --> 14:39.651
This area over here with the underpants
is the laundry annex.

14:40.852 --> 14:43.389
Uh, oh, over here is the gym...

14:43.945 --> 14:46.725
Membership included...

14:47.845 --> 14:51.693
And through that door is the
bathroom / library...

14:51.948 --> 14:56.069
Although currently all we have to read
is a Sports Illustrated and a bottle of Prell.

14:58.976 --> 14:59.792
You okay ?

14:59.802 --> 15:01.447
Yeah. I’m fine.

15:02.446 --> 15:04.664
It’s just weird you know.
Moving in with someone...

15:05.468 --> 15:08.564
But great...
Weird, but great...

15:09.352 --> 15:11.993
You know, like midgets...

15:13.900 --> 15:15.031
There’s nothing to worry about.

15:15.383 --> 15:19.008
Oh and the closet’s really full, but you
can just hang anything you want on
the drum kit.

15:19.605 --> 15:21.156
I was gonna use it but you know...

15:21.824 --> 15:23.322
impulse-buy.

15:25.001 --> 15:28.385
- Seriously, you’re okay with this ?
- Yeah. Yeah, I’ll be fine.

15:29.494 --> 15:32.154
Then here you go, I made you a key.

15:32.668 --> 15:34.076
Put your name on the mailbox.

15:35.125 --> 15:37.479
So I guess we are officially
living together.

15:37.839 --> 15:40.978
Uhuh. Nice.

15:42.011 --> 15:43.386
Heyyy, there he is.

15:43.604 --> 15:44.940
Donna, this is Pickles.

15:44.940 --> 15:46.512
Pickles, meet Donna.

15:46.901 --> 15:49.202
- She’s your new Mommy !
- Hi Mommy !

15:51.809 --> 15:54.125
Yeah uhm… I gotta go !

15:57.766 --> 16:00.155
Chick magnet my ass !

16:06.220 --> 16:08.886
Wow man.
The stuff you said to Jackie.

16:09.443 --> 16:10.856
So mean and hurtful.

16:11.658 --> 16:13.418
I only wish I’d said it myself.

16:14.916 --> 16:16.448
Well, I’m glad she’s gone.

16:17.564 --> 16:19.546
I’ve never felt so happy about
anything in my life.

16:26.406 --> 16:27.967
What did I do ?!

16:32.920 --> 16:34.956
Jackie was in love with me and
I let her go.

16:37.357 --> 16:39.543
And all that I have is
an empty apartment.

16:40.439 --> 16:43.707
And the scent of her perfume on
my boxers, where I sprayed it.

16:45.504 --> 16:46.846
Don’t worry man.

16:47.449 --> 16:48.543
You’re doing the right thing.

16:49.200 --> 16:51.911
I know you wanna run after her
but as your friend...

16:52.575 --> 16:54.394
...I am not gonna let you.

16:56.732 --> 16:59.045
JACKIE I’M COMING !!!

17:01.326 --> 17:03.195
Hah, you can call my bluf.

17:04.404 --> 17:08.441
That Bob and his crazy ideas.
We can never move to Florida.

17:09.138 --> 17:11.722
Well it’s easy for him to do.
But we have real ties here.

17:12.575 --> 17:16.483
I’m three piggie stamps away from
a free ham at the supermarket !

17:18.160 --> 17:19.638
And I’ve got responsibilities.

17:20.108 --> 17:23.906
Spring is coming up, who is gonna
poison the new batch of squirrels ?

17:30.921 --> 17:32.578
Let’s move to Florida...

17:33.702 --> 17:34.474
You really want to ?

17:35.068 --> 17:36.424
- Do you ?
- If you do !

17:36.799 --> 17:38.174
- I do !
- Me too !

17:38.547 --> 17:41.290
- Then let’s do it !
- Ohohohoohhh ! Red !

17:42.390 --> 17:46.539
I am so excited there is so much
to do in Florida, it’ll be such an adventure.

17:47.020 --> 17:50.788
Nooo, I just wanna go down there
and kinda sit around till we die.

18:07.845 --> 18:09.961
Donna, come on.
Just…

18:10.708 --> 18:11.927
...tell me why you left.

18:12.832 --> 18:14.708
I don’t know, it all hit me at once,
I just…

18:14.971 --> 18:16.485
I just like needed some air.

18:17.250 --> 18:20.030
Well if Pickles saying "Hi Mommy"
freaked you out...

18:20.828 --> 18:22.177
I’ll let you in on a little secret.

18:22.724 --> 18:24.241
That was actually me.

18:25.863 --> 18:28.739
You know what, it’s just this whole
Florida thing is really freakin’ me out.

18:29.906 --> 18:32.501
When you asked me to move in
it seemed like the right thing to do but…

18:34.086 --> 18:38.585
when I got there I sort of realized that
I’m just doing it cause I’m too afraid
to start my life.

18:40.267 --> 18:42.941
I used to have like plans.

18:44.040 --> 18:45.151
What did you wanna do ?

18:46.751 --> 18:47.940
Go to college.

18:50.897 --> 18:52.876
I got accepted in Madison
last year so…

18:54.705 --> 18:56.835
I don’t know, I think it’s time
I finally go.

18:57.470 --> 19:00.627
That’s cool. It’s only a few hours
away, we can totally make that work.

19:02.426 --> 19:03.774
No, you don’t understand.

19:06.977 --> 19:10.536
This... it just isn’t what I want.

19:12.916 --> 19:17.212
Oh. So, that’s it for us ?

19:19.306 --> 19:20.851
I’m really sorry.

19:22.541 --> 19:23.524
Me too.

19:24.630 --> 19:26.278
Kinda sucks.

19:31.378 --> 19:32.399
Hey Donna !

19:33.114 --> 19:35.582
Check out my new Speedo
for Florida !

19:36.534 --> 19:39.146
Dad, why can’t you just buy
a regular bathing suit ?

19:40.299 --> 19:42.154
Those make me look silly...

19:47.441 --> 19:48.316
Jackie...

19:49.088 --> 19:50.340
There you are.

19:50.883 --> 19:52.036
What do you want Fez ?

19:52.840 --> 19:54.410
I ran all the way here to find you.

19:55.191 --> 19:56.541
My car is in the shop.

19:58.779 --> 20:02.621
And you’ll be glad to hear that they
are changing the word "tiny" to "large"…

20:04.308 --> 20:06.791
- Look I don’t care about any of this.
- Jackie wait.

20:09.133 --> 20:11.271
Look I didn’t mean all those horrible
things I said.

20:12.183 --> 20:14.224
You’re not ugly, you’re beautiful.

20:15.570 --> 20:19.092
Even if you dumped me after a week
it’d be the best week of my life.

20:21.090 --> 20:22.757
I just wanna be with you.

20:23.633 --> 20:25.571
Fez, you really, really hurt me.

20:26.600 --> 20:29.990
And I thought you were the one person
who would never speak to me like that.

20:31.757 --> 20:34.695
You're not the guy I thought you were,
and I don't think I could ever be with with you.

20:35.101 --> 20:37.445
- But Jackie...
- No. Goodbye, Fez.

20:51.255 --> 20:53.660
Oh, Mr. Forman, thank God
you're here.

20:53.925 --> 20:57.908
I just had my heart broken and
I really need someone to talk to.
