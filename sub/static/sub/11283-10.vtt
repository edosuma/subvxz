WEBVTT

00:07.608 --> 00:10.175
Thank you.
There you go.

00:10.177 --> 00:11.443
I can't believe
you remember that.

00:11.445 --> 00:12.778
What, are you kidding me?

00:12.780 --> 00:14.313
You singing
"Everybody Hurts"?

00:14.315 --> 00:18.450
Oh, sorry.
Yeah, my R.E.M. phase.

00:18.452 --> 00:21.286
Well, I couldn't take
my eyes off you, so...

00:21.288 --> 00:23.255
Are you sure it didn't
have anything to do

00:23.257 --> 00:25.057
with what I was
wearing, maybe?

00:25.059 --> 00:26.658
Uh, black leather miniskirt,
white tank top...

00:26.660 --> 00:28.727
Seriously, though,
you guys were good.

00:28.729 --> 00:30.262
Coulda went
on the road.

00:30.264 --> 00:31.430
I don't think so.

00:31.432 --> 00:34.633
Okay, you know, I--
I got a confession.

00:34.635 --> 00:38.370
Your best show, 5:00 a.m.,
morning after graduation,

00:38.372 --> 00:40.339
on the roof of the gym.

00:40.341 --> 00:42.207
What?

00:42.209 --> 00:45.444
You'd just got dumped
by Curtis at that party.

00:45.446 --> 00:48.147
God, I don't
believe this.

00:48.149 --> 00:50.215
Took your guitar,
you went up to the roof,

00:50.217 --> 00:51.717
and you came up with this

00:51.719 --> 00:53.519
really gentle song.

00:53.521 --> 00:54.753
You were up there?
You were singing...

00:54.755 --> 00:56.488
I'm sorry.

00:56.490 --> 01:00.125
It's just, after I heard that,
I thought... I felt like I...

01:00.127 --> 01:02.728
knew you.

01:02.730 --> 01:04.430
You know, there's this
wine-tasting thing

01:04.432 --> 01:06.398
at Niagara-on-the-Lake
next weekend.

01:06.400 --> 01:08.367
I was thinking, you know,
maybe we could go?

01:08.369 --> 01:10.369
Um...
I mean, we don't
have to stay over,

01:10.371 --> 01:12.404
it could just
be a day trip.

01:12.406 --> 01:15.107
I was just thinking,
'cause we haven't seen
each other for a while.

01:15.109 --> 01:17.509
Yeah, yeah. And it's
been really great.

01:17.511 --> 01:19.545
I-- I just...
(gunshot, faint scream)

01:19.547 --> 01:20.546
What was that?

01:20.548 --> 01:21.713
That was gunfire.

01:21.715 --> 01:23.382
(people screaming)

01:23.384 --> 01:24.283
Wait, hold on.

01:24.285 --> 01:26.285
Steve! Wait!

01:26.287 --> 01:29.088
(tires screech, horns blare)
MAN: Hey, watch it!
Hey, what are you doing?

01:29.090 --> 01:30.155
JULES:
Stop!

01:32.626 --> 01:35.294
MAN:
Somebody's been shot!
Winnie, it's Jules.

01:35.296 --> 01:36.528
Oh, hey! How are you
enjoying your day off?

01:36.530 --> 01:37.729
JULES:
I've got shots fired

01:37.731 --> 01:41.633
inside the Sultan Grill,
on the Danforth.

01:41.635 --> 01:42.701
Guys, guys!

01:42.703 --> 01:44.703
What's happening?
Are you okay?

01:44.705 --> 01:46.138
We're outside
the restaurant right now.

01:46.140 --> 01:47.739
Is the shooter still inside?

01:47.741 --> 01:49.575
JULES:
I can't see.

01:49.577 --> 01:52.177
Someone's shot, Jules.
I gotta, I gotta get in there.
No, Steve.

01:52.179 --> 01:54.279
We need to wait for backup.
The shooter might still...
Jules!

01:54.281 --> 01:55.514
Let's go!
Jules, hang tight!
We're coming!

01:55.516 --> 01:57.549
Team One, hot call! Suit up!

01:57.551 --> 01:59.151
He could be dead
before they get here.

01:59.153 --> 02:01.253
Don't go in there! Steve!

02:01.255 --> 02:04.189
WINNIE: Shots fired at the
Sultan Grill on the Danforth.

02:04.191 --> 02:05.557
One confirmed victim down.

02:05.559 --> 02:07.459
GUNMAN: I warned you!
I asked you a simple question,

02:07.461 --> 02:09.595
all you had to do was answer.
Eric?

02:09.597 --> 02:11.563
Now one more time!
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

02:11.565 --> 02:14.133
Tell me where he is!
I don't know!

02:15.736 --> 02:16.869
Where's Riyaz?

02:16.871 --> 02:18.637
I'm sorry, I
don't know who that is.

02:18.639 --> 02:20.706
Where are your hands?
Where are your hands?!

02:20.708 --> 02:23.475
No. No cell phones.

02:23.477 --> 02:25.344
Okay, all cell phones
on the floor, now. Now!

02:25.346 --> 02:26.578
Go get 'em.
Collect them!

02:27.481 --> 02:29.481
GUNMAN:
Now! Anyone caught attempting

02:29.483 --> 02:31.783
to communicate
with him will be shot,

02:31.785 --> 02:33.519
do you understand me?
It's gonna be okay.

02:33.521 --> 02:35.821
Total communication blackout.
All right?
I'm a medic.

02:35.823 --> 02:38.590
I'm gonna help you.
You're gonna be okay.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

02:38.592 --> 02:39.658
Easy, easy.
What are
you doing?

02:39.660 --> 02:41.226
He just wants to make sure

02:41.228 --> 02:42.528
that he's okay.
Okay, well, get away.

02:42.530 --> 02:43.495
Come on, get away!

02:43.497 --> 02:45.531
Get away from him!

02:45.533 --> 02:48.367
You. Lock it! Lock the door!

02:48.369 --> 02:51.703
You. Barricade it.
Tables and chairs, come on.

02:51.705 --> 02:53.405
Nobody's leaving
until I get some answers.

02:53.407 --> 02:56.608
All right. You...

02:56.610 --> 02:58.610
Knives, forks, uh, corkscrews,
any sharp implements.

02:58.612 --> 03:01.647
If I find anything that
can be used as a weapon...

03:01.649 --> 03:05.184
Go! Come on, come on, come on!

03:05.186 --> 03:07.920
That's good.
Get against the wall.

03:07.922 --> 03:09.221
Hands where I can see 'em.

03:09.223 --> 03:10.822
Go! Move!

03:20.301 --> 03:22.467
Set up a perimeter.
Get the uniforms and keep all

03:22.469 --> 03:24.203
these people back.
Let's do it now!

03:24.205 --> 03:25.637
We're dealing with
at least one shooter.

03:25.639 --> 03:27.239
How many hostages?

03:27.241 --> 03:29.508
ED:
Ten, maybe more.
SAM: Jules?

03:29.510 --> 03:31.110
Limited vantage.

03:31.111 --> 03:32.711
Looks like the front
doors are barricaded.

03:32.713 --> 03:35.214
Maybe Jules can feed us
information from inside.

03:35.216 --> 03:37.416
Nah, if that gunman
finds out Jules is a cop...

03:40.988 --> 03:42.688
All right.
(whispering)

03:42.690 --> 03:45.524
Hey. Quiet! Get-- hey-- you guys
clear out of here.

03:45.526 --> 03:47.626
Go! I want everyone
to keep quiet.

03:47.628 --> 03:49.261
I gotta... think.

03:49.263 --> 03:50.662
You. On the floor.

03:50.664 --> 03:52.364
Knees! Here.

03:52.366 --> 03:54.533
Hands behind the head.

03:54.535 --> 03:56.535
You know what this
place is, right?

03:56.537 --> 03:58.604
It's-- it's a restaurant.

03:58.606 --> 04:01.807
Yes, yes, yes, yes, it looks
very much like a restaurant,

04:01.809 --> 04:03.542
but do you--
(frustrated sigh)

04:03.544 --> 04:04.776
do you know what it<i> is?</i>

04:04.778 --> 04:07.246
(exhales)

04:07.248 --> 04:10.282
What are you looking at?!

04:10.284 --> 04:12.551
(PDA buzzes)
GUNMAN:
You know what it's really for?

04:12.553 --> 04:18.457
You know who meets here,
and what they want? Huh?

04:18.459 --> 04:20.359
Where's Riyaz?

04:20.361 --> 04:21.660
(PDA chirps)

04:21.662 --> 04:23.595
PARKER
Jules is okay.

04:23.596 --> 04:25.529
She says there's one gunman
and 18 hostages.

04:25.532 --> 04:27.916
What's the gunman want?

04:27.917 --> 04:30.301
GUNMAN: Riyaz should
be here now. Where is he?

04:30.304 --> 04:31.570
(PDA chirps)

04:31.572 --> 04:32.771
PARKER:
Looking for Riyaz.

04:32.773 --> 04:33.772
Who's Riyaz?

04:33.774 --> 04:35.274
Hey, Spike.

04:35.276 --> 04:37.042
PARKER: See if there's a
connection between

04:37.044 --> 04:38.910
the Sultan Grill and someone

04:38.912 --> 04:40.946
named Riyaz.
On it.

04:40.948 --> 04:42.914
You told him not to come,
because I'm here.

04:42.916 --> 04:44.916
Didn't you?
I don't even know
what you mean.

04:44.918 --> 04:46.952
I gotta try to talk to him.

04:46.954 --> 04:48.654
(gasping)

04:49.690 --> 04:50.989
JULES:
Sir?
Hey!

04:50.991 --> 04:52.624
You stay where you are.
I'm gonna stay right here.

04:52.626 --> 04:53.759
All right. Good.

04:53.761 --> 04:55.927
My name's Jules. What's yours?

04:55.929 --> 04:58.697
Oh.
(laughs)

04:58.699 --> 05:00.365
You're looking
for somebody named Riyaz?

05:00.367 --> 05:02.301
Yeah. What? You know him?

05:02.303 --> 05:04.469
No, I don't. But maybe
I could help you find him.

05:04.471 --> 05:06.838
Oh. Well, he knows him!

05:06.840 --> 05:09.374
And if he had just
told me where he was,

05:09.376 --> 05:10.942
when I asked, then this
wouldn't have happened.

05:10.944 --> 05:11.910
(siren wails)

05:11.912 --> 05:13.779
No...

05:13.781 --> 05:15.681
Oh, no. No, no. Okay.

05:15.683 --> 05:17.582
Uh, everybody...

05:17.584 --> 05:19.785
Go! Go! Everybody,
against the door!

05:19.787 --> 05:21.420
Go to the front.
Everybody!

05:21.422 --> 05:22.754
Go, go, go!

05:22.756 --> 05:23.689
Against the front.

05:23.691 --> 05:25.624
Go. Against the door.

05:25.626 --> 05:27.025
Go, now!

05:27.027 --> 05:29.861
He's lining up hostages
against the window.

05:29.863 --> 05:31.563
He's making a human shield.

05:31.565 --> 05:32.764
Sam?

05:33.767 --> 05:35.067
No vantage. I'm coming down.

05:35.069 --> 05:36.902
Hey. Hey! What are you doing?

05:36.904 --> 05:38.937
Sir, this man is losing
a lot of blood. He needs

05:38.939 --> 05:40.072
to go to the
hospital.

05:40.074 --> 05:41.606
I said no one's leaving!
Okay.

05:41.608 --> 05:43.008
Well, this is my friend Steve.
He's a paramedic.

05:43.009 --> 05:44.409
If you let him look at him,
maybe he can help him,

05:44.411 --> 05:45.544
and then you can find Riyaz.

05:45.546 --> 05:46.912
That's what you
want, right?

05:46.914 --> 05:48.513
(panting)

05:48.515 --> 05:49.715
Yeah.

05:52.486 --> 05:54.920
Just hang in there, buddy.
Hang in.

05:56.657 --> 05:58.724
Okay, he's barely conscious.
Look, I'm going to need

05:58.726 --> 06:00.792
some napkins, clean
water and plastic wrap.

06:00.794 --> 06:02.027
I can get them.

06:03.430 --> 06:06.431
Okay. Go.

06:06.433 --> 06:07.566
Stay where
I can see you.

06:07.568 --> 06:10.669
Come on. Come on.
Move fast!

06:12.573 --> 06:14.473
Okay. We know
who we're looking for.

06:14.475 --> 06:17.008
The owner of the restaurant
is Riyaz Fayad.

06:17.010 --> 06:19.911
Good. Now let's find out
who's got a beef with him.

06:19.913 --> 06:22.147
Neighbors,
disgruntled employees?

06:22.149 --> 06:23.448
What's going on, Eddie?
All right.

06:23.450 --> 06:25.050
We got an air vent on the roof.

06:25.052 --> 06:26.918
Might be able to feed
a snake cam through that.

06:26.920 --> 06:28.954
All right, go for it.
Let's do it.

06:32.426 --> 06:34.760
Is Eric going to be okay?

06:34.762 --> 06:36.795
He's got decreased breath sounds
on the left side.

06:36.797 --> 06:38.497
What does that mean?
His lung collapsed.

06:38.499 --> 06:39.865
Oh, my God.

06:39.867 --> 06:41.066
Look, he needs
chest decompression.

06:41.068 --> 06:43.135
You don't happen to have
a kit in your purse,

06:43.137 --> 06:44.436
do you?

06:44.438 --> 06:45.604
Can you improvise?
Yeah.

06:45.606 --> 06:46.838
I need a pen. I need some vodka.

06:46.840 --> 06:48.039
A knife.

06:48.041 --> 06:49.941
Sir?

06:49.943 --> 06:52.744
A knife?

06:52.746 --> 06:54.146
What do you think I am,
an idiot?

06:54.148 --> 06:55.480
I promise we're going
to hand it back

06:55.482 --> 06:56.681
as soon as we're done.
Please.

06:58.452 --> 06:59.618
All right.

06:59.620 --> 07:00.619
JULES:
Whoa, whoa.

07:00.621 --> 07:02.187
What are you doing?

07:02.189 --> 07:06.558
If you try anything,
I'm going to shoot her.

07:09.797 --> 07:11.563
(woman hyperventilating)

07:11.565 --> 07:13.198
I'm going to get the vodka.

07:13.200 --> 07:14.599
Okay, go.

07:15.869 --> 07:17.202
Just go!
I'm going.

07:31.652 --> 07:34.219
Here you go.
Thanks.

07:35.189 --> 07:37.122
Okay. Knife.
Mm-hmm.

07:40.494 --> 07:41.159
You got it?

07:41.161 --> 07:42.794
Yep.

07:42.796 --> 07:44.896
Look, I'm sorry
for getting us into this.

07:44.898 --> 07:47.499
You were just
trying to help.

07:47.501 --> 07:50.001
Okay.

07:51.071 --> 07:54.239
(slicing, Steve groans)

07:54.241 --> 07:55.540
Oh, my God.

07:55.542 --> 07:57.075
(murmurs)

08:00.047 --> 08:01.480
Okay. Hand me the pen.

08:01.482 --> 08:03.548
Okay.

08:14.628 --> 08:15.927
Hand me the
plastic wrap.

08:15.929 --> 08:17.662
Yep.

08:17.664 --> 08:19.631
This is going
to hold the pen in place.

08:19.633 --> 08:21.566
It's going to protect the wound.
Pass me the knife.

08:21.568 --> 08:22.901
Slide it across the
ground. Come on.

08:22.903 --> 08:24.269
(woman gasping)

08:26.507 --> 08:27.806
Okay.

08:27.808 --> 08:29.875
There. All right.

08:38.819 --> 08:39.951
All right.

08:42.222 --> 08:43.955
Angle it a little to the left.

08:46.260 --> 08:47.225
I'm in.

08:47.227 --> 08:48.226
ED:
Spike?

08:48.228 --> 08:49.594
Eyes are good.

08:49.596 --> 08:51.663
PARKER: All right.
Steve's taking care

08:51.665 --> 08:52.831
of the gunshot victim.

08:52.833 --> 08:54.599
I don't see
any other wounded.

08:54.601 --> 08:57.068
There's a lot of buzz
on Riyaz Fayad.

08:57.070 --> 08:58.937
Terror watch blogs,
mainstream press...

08:58.939 --> 09:00.906
They're all suggesting
he's a leader

09:00.908 --> 09:02.574
of an extremist terror cell.

09:02.576 --> 09:04.910
Anti-Terror Unit
investigating?

09:04.912 --> 09:08.280
Uh, the details are classified.
Take time to get more intel.

09:08.282 --> 09:11.082
Eddie, Fayad's being
investigated for terrorism.

09:11.084 --> 09:13.285
You think he's connected
to the gunman?

09:13.287 --> 09:15.320
I don't know.
Why don't you go talk to him?
Spike.

09:15.322 --> 09:17.255
Yeah. Sending the address
to your PDAs right now.

09:17.257 --> 09:19.624
Let's move it.
PARKER:
Maybe he's got the information

09:19.626 --> 09:20.692
we need to play things out.

09:23.297 --> 09:24.930
GUNMAN: You. You!
Gray shirt.

09:24.932 --> 09:26.831
Come here!
On your knees.

09:26.833 --> 09:28.099
Get on your
knees. Kneel.

09:28.101 --> 09:29.334
PARKER:
All right.

09:29.336 --> 09:31.303
That's it. I'm calling in.

09:31.305 --> 09:33.572
Where's Riyaz?
(phone ringing)

09:33.574 --> 09:35.273
Where's Riyaz?!
I don't know!

09:35.275 --> 09:37.342
I don't know.
Come on! We're
running out of time here!

09:37.344 --> 09:38.643
(phone rings)

09:38.645 --> 09:39.678
I bet that's the police.

09:39.680 --> 09:41.179
Maybe they want to help.

09:41.181 --> 09:43.615
Yeah. You'd think so,
but, you know, no.

09:43.617 --> 09:44.583
In the big picture,
they're just puppets.

09:44.585 --> 09:45.350
There's nothing they can do.

09:45.352 --> 09:46.818
Okay, but maybe you can help

09:46.820 --> 09:48.570
show them the big picture,

09:48.571 --> 09:50.321
and explain to them why
you want to find this guy.

09:50.324 --> 09:52.591
(ringing continues)

09:52.593 --> 09:53.725
Uh...

09:53.727 --> 09:54.926
Okay, fine. Answer it.

09:55.829 --> 09:57.762
(ringing continues)

10:00.133 --> 10:01.299
(phone beeps on)

10:01.301 --> 10:02.300
JULES:
Hello?

10:02.302 --> 10:04.970
So much for your day off, huh?

10:04.972 --> 10:06.237
JULES:
Yes.

10:06.239 --> 10:07.672
There's a gentleman here.

10:07.674 --> 10:09.741
He's looking
for a man named Riyaz Fayad.

10:09.743 --> 10:11.810
It's very important.

10:11.812 --> 10:13.044
JULES:
Can you help him find him?

10:13.046 --> 10:15.063
Get me his name, Jules.

10:15.064 --> 10:17.081
They'll help you find Riyaz
if you give them your name.

10:19.386 --> 10:20.852
It's Davis Lagosto.

10:20.854 --> 10:22.187
JULES:
Okay. It's Davis Lagosto.

10:22.189 --> 10:23.388
I'll check him out.

10:23.390 --> 10:25.857
Why do you need to find Riyaz?

10:25.859 --> 10:28.159
Riyaz Fayad's using
this restaurant as a front

10:28.161 --> 10:29.361
for his terrorist operations.

10:29.363 --> 10:31.763
Okay, I have
reliable sources.

10:31.765 --> 10:34.299
I'm just here to stop him
before he strikes.

10:34.301 --> 10:36.735
Tell him Fayad's being
investigated by the ATU.

10:36.737 --> 10:39.738
Riyaz is already under
investigation by the ATU,

10:39.740 --> 10:41.373
the Anti-Terror Unit.

10:41.375 --> 10:42.907
And if he's a terrorist,
they're going to do

10:42.909 --> 10:44.309
everything they can
to bring him to justice.

10:44.311 --> 10:47.112
No! By then, it'll be too late!

10:47.114 --> 10:48.313
What?

10:48.315 --> 10:50.281
It's-It's going
to happen any day now.

10:50.283 --> 10:52.133
What's happening?
He and his people.

10:52.134 --> 10:53.984
They're-They're going to be
planting bombs on the subway.

10:53.987 --> 10:55.353
How does he know this?

10:55.355 --> 10:57.305
JULES:
Okay. If you know

10:57.306 --> 10:59.256
of a terrorist act, you
have to tell the police.

10:59.259 --> 11:01.159
Get back!
Okay. I'm back.

11:01.161 --> 11:02.694
What are you doing?
I thought you were helping me.

11:02.696 --> 11:03.962
I am. I'm-I'm talking
to the police.

11:03.964 --> 11:05.130
LAGOSTO:
Put the gun down!

11:05.132 --> 11:06.364
What's going on, Jules?

11:06.366 --> 11:08.266
Okay, put it down.

11:11.672 --> 11:13.304
Put down the gun!

11:13.306 --> 11:16.374
I-I don't have a gun.

11:16.376 --> 11:19.444
Put down the gun, or I'm gonna
have to shoot you.

11:54.014 --> 11:55.413
Put it down now!

11:55.415 --> 11:57.182
I'm putting it down.

11:57.184 --> 11:58.149
Slowly.

11:58.151 --> 12:00.285
Slowly, slowly.

12:03.857 --> 12:05.223
Okay, good.
Get out.

12:05.225 --> 12:06.458
Get over there, come on.

12:06.460 --> 12:09.127
Come on!

12:09.129 --> 12:11.196
Get back.

12:14.835 --> 12:16.401
All right,
hands above your head.

12:17.270 --> 12:19.237
Wait. He didn't
hang up the phone.

12:19.239 --> 12:21.005
Thank you, Davis.
We still have ears.

12:21.007 --> 12:22.173
SPIKE:
Transferring the
line to headset.

12:22.175 --> 12:23.508
What do you have on Davis?

12:23.510 --> 12:25.076
Substance abuse?

12:25.078 --> 12:26.244
SPIKE:
No, but we do have

12:26.246 --> 12:27.412
breaking and entering,
assault...

12:27.414 --> 12:28.780
A history of violence.

12:28.782 --> 12:30.181
Also served time
in a psych ward.

12:30.183 --> 12:31.800
What's he been diagnosed with?

12:31.801 --> 12:33.418
Uh, can't get details.
I'd have to get clearance.

12:33.420 --> 12:34.953
Oh, some kind of
delusional disorder.

12:34.955 --> 12:36.755
Let's see if we can
track down his family.

12:36.757 --> 12:39.057
So this terrorist
attack...
Could be delusion,
could be

12:39.059 --> 12:40.225
there's a grain of truth.

12:40.227 --> 12:41.777
Riyaz Fayad
is being investigated.

12:41.778 --> 12:43.328
SPIKE:
Still waiting on
that call from ATU,

12:43.330 --> 12:45.063
see if there's
been any chatter.

12:50.871 --> 12:52.203
Police.

12:52.205 --> 12:53.371
Riyaz Fayad, open the door!

12:53.373 --> 12:54.906
Do it now!

12:55.876 --> 12:57.942
Police.

12:58.879 --> 13:01.179
Can I help you?
Yeah.

13:01.181 --> 13:03.248
We're here to talk
to Riyaz Fayad.
What do you want with him?

13:03.250 --> 13:04.849
We need to ask him
a few questions.

13:04.851 --> 13:06.417
Sorry. He's not here
right now. Hey!

13:06.419 --> 13:08.520
Police! Wordy.
Wait!
Leave him alone!

13:08.522 --> 13:09.821
Police!

13:09.823 --> 13:11.122
(panting)

13:11.124 --> 13:12.957
Police! Stop
right there!

13:12.959 --> 13:14.359
Police!
Right there!
Right there!

13:14.361 --> 13:15.460
Let's see some hands now!

13:15.462 --> 13:16.861
WORDY:
Do it now!

13:17.798 --> 13:20.131
Sir.
Don't come any closer!

13:20.133 --> 13:21.466
Mr. Fayad, I'm Officer Lane,

13:21.468 --> 13:23.168
this is Officer Wordsworth.

13:23.170 --> 13:25.170
Now, we just need to
talk, but you need to put

13:25.172 --> 13:27.238
that weapon down now.
Sir, we just want
to talk to you.

13:27.240 --> 13:28.840
I haven't done anything wrong!

13:28.842 --> 13:32.076
Mr. Fayad, we have to
consider that a threat, sir.

13:32.078 --> 13:33.578
I know how this works!

13:33.580 --> 13:36.147
You capture me like an animal.

13:36.149 --> 13:37.515
No lawyer, no rights.

13:37.517 --> 13:40.084
Fly me off to some other country
to be tortured.

13:40.086 --> 13:42.287
Please, Riyaz, don't.
Mrs. Fayad,
back in the house.

13:42.289 --> 13:43.388
Back in the house!

13:43.390 --> 13:45.156
Cashmira, stay back.

13:45.158 --> 13:47.325
Mr. Fayad,
listen to your wife.

13:47.327 --> 13:48.927
We just want
to talk here.

13:48.929 --> 13:50.295
You knock on my door

13:50.297 --> 13:52.197
with assault weapons
for a conversation?

13:52.199 --> 13:54.966
We will put the guns away.
Please put the pipe down.

13:56.469 --> 13:58.503
Please, Riyaz.
Just help us out here.

13:59.472 --> 14:01.105
Don't make this
any worse.

14:08.248 --> 14:09.480
That's it.
Thank you, sir. Wordy?

14:09.482 --> 14:11.249
Drop it! Drop it!

14:11.251 --> 14:12.417
Right now!
That's it.

14:12.419 --> 14:13.351
Turn around.

14:13.353 --> 14:15.620
Up against the fence.

14:17.390 --> 14:19.290
Just tell me
if he's okay, will you?

14:19.292 --> 14:20.959
PARKER:
Right now,

14:20.960 --> 14:22.627
he's got a gun, and he's holding
several people hostage

14:22.629 --> 14:23.995
inside a restaurant.

14:23.997 --> 14:25.163
Oh, my God.

14:25.165 --> 14:27.298
Davis, my boy.

14:27.300 --> 14:29.467
Oh!

14:29.469 --> 14:31.102
Mr. Lagosto, we understand

14:31.104 --> 14:33.538
that your son has a history
of mental illness.

14:33.540 --> 14:35.974
Yeah.

14:35.976 --> 14:38.443
He was diagnosed
paranoid schizophrenic

14:38.445 --> 14:39.944
when he was 15.

14:39.946 --> 14:41.412
So, he suffers from delusions?

14:41.414 --> 14:42.513
Yeah.

14:42.515 --> 14:43.982
Yeah.

14:43.984 --> 14:45.316
<i> Davis thinks</i>

14:45.318 --> 14:46.651
<i> everyone's out to get him.</i>

14:46.653 --> 14:48.186
Hey, Davis,
how you doing?

14:48.188 --> 14:49.354
Are you okay?

14:49.356 --> 14:50.889
Riyaz should have been here
by now.

14:50.891 --> 14:52.056
Where is he?

14:52.058 --> 14:53.892
Well, the police
are looking for him.

14:53.894 --> 14:55.526
Yeah, well, we're running
out of time.

14:55.528 --> 14:57.328
ED:
<i> We have an armed man</i>

14:57.330 --> 14:58.630
who has barricaded himself

14:58.632 --> 15:00.465
inside your restaurant,
looking for you.

15:00.467 --> 15:02.000
Now, we need
to know why.

15:02.002 --> 15:04.335
His name is Davis Lagosto.
You ever seen him?

15:04.337 --> 15:06.204
No, I've never
seen him before.

15:06.206 --> 15:08.473
Soldiers are all out in
the Middle East, you know?

15:08.475 --> 15:10.975
But where are they
when we need them here?

15:10.977 --> 15:13.611
Why do we need soldiers here?

15:13.613 --> 15:14.979
There are terror operatives

15:14.981 --> 15:17.081
in every major city
in North America.

15:17.083 --> 15:19.450
Of course we need them here.

15:19.452 --> 15:21.419
Sounds really scary.

15:21.421 --> 15:25.256
He thought his mother
was under orders to kill him.

15:25.258 --> 15:28.393
So he came
into our bedroom one night

15:28.395 --> 15:30.528
while we were sleeping
with a rope,

15:30.530 --> 15:33.398
tied it around her neck,
tried to strangle her.

15:33.400 --> 15:36.401
I'm sorry. That sounds
terrifying, sir.

15:36.403 --> 15:37.568
(sighs)

15:37.570 --> 15:41.039
But we loved him, you know?

15:41.041 --> 15:43.508
(sighs)

15:43.510 --> 15:47.512
There are dozens of sleeper
cells all across this country.

15:47.514 --> 15:49.514
It's not just Al Qaeda.

15:49.516 --> 15:52.317
It's Hezbollah and Hamas.

15:52.319 --> 15:53.651
WORDY:
<i> Gunman's convinced</i>

15:53.653 --> 15:56.354
that you're planning an attack
on the subway system.

15:56.356 --> 15:58.656
Of course,
'cause I'm a terrorist.

15:58.658 --> 16:00.992
Ever since those news reports
came out,

16:00.994 --> 16:03.027
they've threatened my wife
and my child.

16:03.029 --> 16:05.430
They painted hate messages
on my home and my restaurant,

16:05.432 --> 16:07.532
all based on nothing.

16:07.534 --> 16:08.666
They could be living
next door to you,

16:08.668 --> 16:10.034
and you wouldn't even know it.

16:10.036 --> 16:11.669
And you feel like
it's your responsibility

16:11.671 --> 16:13.171
to do something about it.

16:13.173 --> 16:16.641
I don't have a choice!

16:16.643 --> 16:18.409
There was an anti-psychotic.

16:18.411 --> 16:20.712
Really helped for a while.

16:20.714 --> 16:23.414
Uh, Davis managed
to get through college.

16:23.416 --> 16:25.116
Got a degree
in chemical engineering.

16:25.118 --> 16:27.251
What, the drug stopped working?

16:27.253 --> 16:28.653
Yeah. He had a breakdown
after college.

16:28.655 --> 16:30.939
Had to be hospitalized.

16:30.940 --> 16:33.224
All right, Mr. Fayad, can we
take a look at those threats?

16:33.226 --> 16:34.459
Gladly.

16:34.461 --> 16:37.395
Wordy, uncuff him. Ma'am?

16:37.397 --> 16:38.629
(handcuffs clicking)

16:40.266 --> 16:42.767
Is he on any medication
right now?

16:42.769 --> 16:45.069
I really don't know. I...

16:45.071 --> 16:47.572
I haven't seen my son
in over a year.

16:47.574 --> 16:49.124
Why not, sir?

16:49.125 --> 16:50.675
Last time I checked him
into the hospital,

16:50.677 --> 16:52.477
he got very angry.

16:52.479 --> 16:54.779
He thought I was trying
to have him committed.

16:54.781 --> 16:57.215
When he got out,

16:57.217 --> 16:59.584
I tried to get him
to come home, but...

16:59.586 --> 17:01.786
he didn't want any part of me.

17:01.788 --> 17:04.455
Okay, where is he living
now, do you know?

17:04.457 --> 17:07.392
He's, uh... at Harmony House.
It's a group home.

17:07.394 --> 17:09.060
St. George Street.

17:09.062 --> 17:10.661
Okay, just hang on one second,
Mr. Lagosto.

17:10.663 --> 17:12.797
Get ahold of Harmony House.
I'm sure he's got

17:12.799 --> 17:15.500
a social worker there.
Let's get in touch with him.

17:17.303 --> 17:19.537
Mr. Irwin?
Yeah.

17:19.539 --> 17:21.272
How you doing?
I'm Sergeant Parker.

17:21.274 --> 17:22.407
Thank you for coming.

17:22.409 --> 17:24.042
Will you follow
me please, sir?

17:24.044 --> 17:26.611
So you're Davis' primary
social worker?

17:26.613 --> 17:29.080
Yeah. I've known him
for over two years.

17:29.082 --> 17:31.082
Look, this is
all my fault.

17:31.084 --> 17:32.650
Davis is my responsibility.

17:32.652 --> 17:34.052
Look, we understand that Davis

17:34.054 --> 17:35.820
has been charged with
assault in the past.

17:35.822 --> 17:38.423
Now, these violent outbursts--
do they happen often?

17:38.425 --> 17:40.358
He's not some kind
of monster. He's sick.

17:40.360 --> 17:41.592
Yeah, I understand
that, sir...

17:41.594 --> 17:43.061
Look, paranoid schizophrenics

17:43.063 --> 17:45.130
are prone to suspicion.

17:45.131 --> 17:47.198
If they feel threatened,
they sometimes lash out
to protect themselves.

17:47.200 --> 17:48.332
But Davis believes
that terrorists

17:48.334 --> 17:49.801
are planning an attack
on the city.

17:49.803 --> 17:51.369
What did he say?

17:51.371 --> 17:54.505
He said that restaurant
is a front for a terror cell.

17:54.507 --> 17:56.541
Has he mentioned

17:56.543 --> 17:58.443
Riyaz Fayad before?
I don't think so.

17:58.445 --> 18:01.412
But he's been talking a lot
about terrorists lately.

18:01.414 --> 18:03.748
Do you know what
might have triggered that?

18:03.750 --> 18:06.150
Terrorism's all over
the news these days.

18:06.152 --> 18:08.719
Bombings in Madrid, Chechnya.

18:08.721 --> 18:09.787
Yeah.

18:11.658 --> 18:13.624
Eric?

18:16.296 --> 18:17.595
Oh, my God.

18:17.597 --> 18:18.629
What's happening?

18:18.631 --> 18:20.164
His pulse is thready.

18:20.166 --> 18:21.732
There's no breath sounds.

18:21.734 --> 18:23.201
My God...

18:23.203 --> 18:26.270
Come on, Eric.
Hang in there.
Oh, my God.

18:26.272 --> 18:28.306
Come on, buddy.

18:28.308 --> 18:30.141
Hang in there, buddy.

18:30.143 --> 18:31.342
Steve...

18:31.344 --> 18:33.311
Why are you stopping?

18:33.313 --> 18:35.746
Help, please.

18:35.748 --> 18:37.115
Tell him
to keep going.

18:37.117 --> 18:38.616
Why are you
stopping?!

18:38.618 --> 18:40.852
I'm sorry. It's...

18:40.854 --> 18:42.854
No.
MAN:
Oh, my God.

18:42.856 --> 18:44.589
LAGOSTO:
Hey!

18:44.591 --> 18:46.224
Is he dead?

18:46.226 --> 18:47.525
Yes.

18:47.527 --> 18:49.627
Oh.

18:49.629 --> 18:51.129
Oh?

18:51.131 --> 18:52.597
Okay, Angela...

18:52.599 --> 18:54.398
That's all you have to say?

18:54.400 --> 18:57.702
Eric never did anything to you.

18:57.704 --> 18:59.537
Okay. He harbored
a known terrorist.

18:59.539 --> 19:01.205
Riyaz is not a terrorist!

19:01.207 --> 19:02.306
What's wrong
with you?!

19:02.308 --> 19:04.542
Okay, she's escalating him now.

19:04.544 --> 19:07.278
Angela, you know what, we need
to stay really calm right now.
Hey!

19:07.280 --> 19:09.714
All right, just shut up!
Quiet! Shut up!

19:09.716 --> 19:11.199
Both of you!

19:11.200 --> 19:12.683
You come in here
on a Muslim witch hunt...

19:12.685 --> 19:14.619
You're not listening to me,
all right?

19:14.621 --> 19:16.921
This is a front
for a terrorist operation.
A front?

19:16.923 --> 19:19.323
So then what does that make me?

19:19.325 --> 19:21.292
All right. Oh, my God,
you're one of them.

19:21.294 --> 19:22.460
You're a black widow.

19:22.462 --> 19:25.229
So now I'm a terrorist, too.

19:25.231 --> 19:26.564
Aw, crap.

19:26.566 --> 19:27.832
Everybody, get back.
Stay back, everybody.

19:27.834 --> 19:29.400
Get back! Get back!

19:29.402 --> 19:31.769
Davis, what do you see?
All right, she's got a bomb.

19:31.771 --> 19:33.638
She's about to
detonate a bomb!
We're all terrorists.

19:33.640 --> 19:35.273
Get down! She's got a bomb!

19:35.942 --> 19:37.308
All right...
Hey...

19:38.311 --> 19:39.644
(gunshot)

19:39.646 --> 19:40.995
Shots fired.

19:40.996 --> 19:42.345
LAGOSTO:
Why'd you do that?
Are you okay?

19:42.348 --> 19:45.249
I think so.
LAGOSTO:
She'll take us all with her.

19:45.251 --> 19:46.350
Oh, my God, Steve.
Stay back.

19:46.352 --> 19:47.718
LAGOSTO:
Nobody try anything.

19:47.720 --> 19:49.687
SAM:
Is Jules okay?

19:49.689 --> 19:51.622
It's Steve. He's been shot.

19:58.831 --> 20:01.432
Steve.
I'm okay.

20:01.434 --> 20:02.833
Just lie
still, Angela.

20:02.835 --> 20:04.735
SAM:
Jules needs backup.
I want to go in.

20:04.737 --> 20:06.337
From where?

20:06.339 --> 20:08.472
This back door leads
right into the basement.

20:08.474 --> 20:10.441
Okay. Sam, you're just

20:10.443 --> 20:11.375
covering on this, all right?

20:11.377 --> 20:12.476
She knows what she's doing.

20:12.478 --> 20:14.412
I know she does.

20:14.414 --> 20:15.646
Just saying.

20:15.648 --> 20:17.915
Yes, sir.

20:20.453 --> 20:22.687
We've got to stop the bleeding.

20:22.689 --> 20:24.755
(groans)

20:24.757 --> 20:26.891
It's okay. I got it, I got it.

20:28.494 --> 20:30.461
Get back. Get back, all of you.
Get back.

20:31.698 --> 20:33.798
All right,
let's slow down...
Shut up! Shut up!

20:33.800 --> 20:37.235
Hands above your head.
Hands above your head.

20:37.237 --> 20:38.636
All right, I know that you're
afraid right now, Davis.

20:38.638 --> 20:40.488
All right, we're leaving.

20:40.489 --> 20:42.339
We have to find something
to bind her hands and feet.

20:42.342 --> 20:44.242
We have to dismantle the bomb.
She's not going to hurt you.

20:44.244 --> 20:45.743
She's got a bomb!
Are you blind?!

20:45.745 --> 20:46.877
Oh, my God.

20:46.879 --> 20:48.446
SPIKE:
He's turning on Jules.

20:48.448 --> 20:50.615
We got to find a way
to get past his delusions.

20:50.617 --> 20:53.284
He said we needed soldiers here.
Maybe I can talk to him as one.

20:53.286 --> 20:55.103
PARKER:
Go for it, Sam.

20:55.104 --> 20:56.921
But boss, this place has serious
security for a restaurant.

20:56.923 --> 20:58.522
I'm looking at reinforced steel.

20:58.524 --> 21:00.391
After 9-11, a lot of
Middle-Eastern businesses

21:00.393 --> 21:01.592
have been targets for vandals.

21:01.594 --> 21:03.427
I'm going to have
to torch my way through.

21:03.429 --> 21:05.396
Copy that.

21:07.333 --> 21:08.833
This brick was thrown
through our window.

21:08.835 --> 21:11.002
"Die, Arab pig."

21:11.004 --> 21:13.938
Sayid was in the room when it
happened. He was terrified.

21:14.907 --> 21:17.441
"Go back to the Middle-East."

21:17.443 --> 21:18.509
He was born in Vancouver.

21:19.846 --> 21:21.912
Why didn't you report this?
Do you think
anyone cares

21:21.914 --> 21:25.449
about death threats against
a suspected terrorist?

21:25.451 --> 21:28.019
Why were you accused
in the first place?

21:28.021 --> 21:32.023
Back in, uh... 2004,

21:32.025 --> 21:34.525
I started donating money
to an Islamic charity.

21:34.527 --> 21:37.762
I was told it was
a scholarship fund

21:37.764 --> 21:38.763
for underprivileged kids.

21:38.765 --> 21:40.031
I found out later

21:40.033 --> 21:42.533
that the charity
was a front used

21:42.535 --> 21:45.036
to fund terrorist activities
including the London bombings.

21:45.038 --> 21:46.604
And from that they assumed

21:46.606 --> 21:48.439
you were the leader
of a terrorist cell.

21:48.441 --> 21:50.608
I convinced a lot of other
members of my mosque

21:50.610 --> 21:52.310
to donate to the same charity.

21:52.312 --> 21:55.513
We thought we were
doing something good.

21:55.515 --> 21:58.683
ATU dragged us from our homes
in the middle of the night.

21:58.685 --> 22:00.885
They interrogated us
for hours.

22:00.887 --> 22:03.554
They froze our bank accounts,
confiscated our passports.

22:03.556 --> 22:05.056
Once it got leaked to the press,

22:05.058 --> 22:06.991
that's when all the threats
started to happen.

22:06.993 --> 22:08.492
SPIKE:
Hey, Ed,

22:08.494 --> 22:10.361
just got off the phone
with the Anti-Terror Unit.

22:10.363 --> 22:12.463
Excuse me one second.

22:13.866 --> 22:15.866
Any intel on a possible attack?

22:15.867 --> 22:17.867
No, and they checked with other
agencies. No chatter, nothing.

22:17.870 --> 22:21.605
And Mr. Fayad?
Well, he's gonna be
on a no-fly list for a while,

22:21.607 --> 22:23.441
but they're wrapping up
their investigation.

22:23.443 --> 22:24.875
He's been cleared of any
wrongdoing.
Okay, good to know.

22:24.877 --> 22:25.976
Thanks, Spike.

22:28.081 --> 22:29.914
The ATU is clearing you.

22:29.916 --> 22:31.449
What?

22:31.451 --> 22:33.884
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God!

22:33.886 --> 22:35.653
CASHMIRA (laughs):
It's over!

22:35.655 --> 22:37.621
Hey, Spike, a lot of these

22:37.623 --> 22:39.123
e-mail threats are being sent

22:39.125 --> 22:41.492
from the same I.P. address.

22:41.494 --> 22:42.626
I'll run a trace,

22:42.628 --> 22:44.662
see if we can
connect them to Davis.

22:55.375 --> 22:56.574
(exhales)

22:58.478 --> 23:00.644
All right, I'm just
gonna change this, okay?

23:00.646 --> 23:02.913
Don't try to be the tough guy--
I know what it feels like.

23:02.915 --> 23:03.981
I've been shot before.

23:03.983 --> 23:05.149
I know how much
pain you're in.

23:05.151 --> 23:06.650
So how do you like
the date so far?

23:06.652 --> 23:08.652
You really know
how to keep a girl

23:08.654 --> 23:11.155
on her toes, huh?
Wait till you see what...

23:11.157 --> 23:12.990
I have planned for the next one.

23:12.992 --> 23:15.493
(whispers): We can't-- he's just
gonna start shooting again.

23:15.495 --> 23:17.695
That's why we got
to do it fast, disarm him.

23:17.697 --> 23:20.064
There are a lot of us
and only one of him.

23:20.066 --> 23:21.999
Steve, you're shivering.
Yeah, the...

23:22.001 --> 23:25.403
the room... is spinning.

23:25.405 --> 23:27.071
Your heart's racing really fast.

23:27.073 --> 23:28.973
Yeah, I'm cold.
I'm just going into shock.

23:31.544 --> 23:33.477
I'm gonna go try and I'm
gonna go get your jacket.

23:33.479 --> 23:34.612
No, no...

23:34.614 --> 23:36.113
Look, look at me,
will you look at me?

23:36.115 --> 23:37.615
You're gonna keep
talking to me, okay?

23:39.185 --> 23:40.851
I'm an idiot.

23:40.853 --> 23:42.686
You're not;
it's not your fault.

23:42.688 --> 23:45.790
No, I mean I shouldn't have
waited so long to ask you out.

23:45.792 --> 23:47.425
Let's save
the deathbed confession

23:47.427 --> 23:48.692
for 50 years from now,

23:48.694 --> 23:50.928
okay?
You gonna be there?

23:55.601 --> 23:57.201
PARKER: Sam, let us
know when you're close.

23:57.203 --> 23:58.869
Hey, guys, those
threats against Riyaz?

23:58.871 --> 24:00.471
You were right.

24:00.473 --> 24:03.040
The I.P. address traces back
to Davis's group home.

24:03.042 --> 24:05.009
So he did make those threats.

24:05.011 --> 24:07.711
Hey, Ed, take a
look at this one.

24:07.713 --> 24:09.647
Okay, boss,
listen to this.

24:09.649 --> 24:11.582
"With one bomb,
you killed 26 people.

24:11.584 --> 24:12.683
"Time for you

24:12.685 --> 24:14.051
"and your followers

24:14.053 --> 24:15.719
to get a taste
of your own medicine."

24:15.721 --> 24:16.987
"Taste of his
own medicine"?

24:16.989 --> 24:18.923
Think Davis built a bomb?
His father mentioned

24:18.925 --> 24:20.825
that he had a degree
in chemical engineering.

24:20.827 --> 24:22.693
So why show up
at the restaurant with a gun?

24:22.695 --> 24:24.161
Maybe he'd already
planted it somewhere

24:24.163 --> 24:25.963
and wanted to take
the leader out personally.

24:25.965 --> 24:27.865
Sounds like Riyaz
wasn't his only target.

24:27.867 --> 24:29.633
Okay, boss, we're gonna head
to the group home.

24:29.635 --> 24:32.069
Okay, Eddie, check Davis's room,
check everywhere--

24:32.071 --> 24:33.971
find out what he's building
and who he's targeting.

24:33.973 --> 24:34.972
Copy that.

24:34.974 --> 24:36.540
Mr. Fayad?

24:36.542 --> 24:38.709
Yes, Officer?

24:38.711 --> 24:41.512
An officer's gonna take you
downtown for processing.

24:41.514 --> 24:43.080
It's just
procedure.

24:43.082 --> 24:44.648
I'll go with you.

24:44.650 --> 24:47.751
No. You and Sayid
go to the mosque.

24:47.753 --> 24:48.886
Pray for Eric

24:48.888 --> 24:50.554
and the others
at the restaurant.

24:50.556 --> 24:51.622
Okay.

24:54.527 --> 24:56.760
(whispers):
Come on, let's go. Come on.

24:56.762 --> 24:58.596
(distorted, echoed voices)

24:58.598 --> 24:59.763
Get back!

24:59.765 --> 25:01.065
Sam, hostages
are turning on him.

25:01.067 --> 25:02.066
Get in there now.

25:02.068 --> 25:03.634
Get back against the wall now!

25:03.636 --> 25:04.635
I'll shoot you
all one by one!

25:04.636 --> 25:05.635
Drop your weapon.
Drop your weapons.

25:05.638 --> 25:06.637
Drop...

25:07.607 --> 25:09.607
Everybody, do what the man says!

25:09.609 --> 25:11.759
(panicked screams)

25:11.760 --> 25:13.910
Drop your weapons
and go back to where you were!

25:13.913 --> 25:15.913
It's all right, buddy,
you can stand down--

25:15.915 --> 25:17.615
I got this area of
operations contained.

25:17.617 --> 25:18.682
Go back to where you were now,

25:18.684 --> 25:19.950
all of you!

25:19.952 --> 25:20.985
Do it now!

25:20.987 --> 25:22.019
Who are you?

25:22.021 --> 25:24.054
I'm Master Corporal
Sam Braddock,

25:24.056 --> 25:25.155
Special Forces.

25:25.157 --> 25:26.590
I'm here to help.

25:26.592 --> 25:30.027
You knew this place
was a front for terrorists?

25:30.029 --> 25:31.161
Sam, don't lie to him.

25:31.163 --> 25:32.630
He's sensitive to deception.

25:32.632 --> 25:34.765
I know what it's like
to feel afraid.

25:34.767 --> 25:36.133
I served two tours
in Afghanistan.

25:36.135 --> 25:38.836
I know what it's like
to walk down the street

25:38.838 --> 25:40.804
and wonder where they're
gonna strike again.

25:40.806 --> 25:43.674
You feel helpless, like
you're never gonna be safe.

25:43.676 --> 25:45.543
That's what they want.

25:45.545 --> 25:47.811
All of us to live
in a state of fear.
Yeah.

25:47.813 --> 25:49.547
That's why we got to fight back.

25:49.549 --> 25:50.648
You know about
the operation...

25:50.650 --> 25:53.751
(gunshot, people yelling)

25:56.022 --> 25:57.288
(grunting, shouting)

25:57.290 --> 25:58.722
Settle down.

25:58.724 --> 25:59.757
What are you doing?!

25:59.759 --> 26:00.925
You... you lied to me!

26:00.927 --> 26:03.928
You lied to me!

26:03.930 --> 26:05.563
SAM:
I didn't lie.
(handcuffs click)

26:05.565 --> 26:06.897
Subject in custody.

26:06.899 --> 26:08.332
PARKER:
Good work, guys, good work.

26:09.802 --> 26:11.802
(panting)

26:11.804 --> 26:13.671
Thank you.

26:15.708 --> 26:17.841
E.M.S, we need E.M.S.
in here now.

26:24.951 --> 26:26.684
Eddie, you find anything
at the group home?

26:26.686 --> 26:29.920
ED:
Boss, we're in the basement.

26:29.922 --> 26:32.756
Davis is building
something here.

26:35.061 --> 26:38.362
And it doesn't look like
any kind of bomb I've ever seen.

26:38.364 --> 26:40.364
(shutter clicks)
Have a look.

26:40.366 --> 26:43.968
(beeping)

26:43.970 --> 26:45.869
Are those fire extinguishers?

26:47.873 --> 26:49.290
Uh-huh.

26:49.291 --> 26:50.708
They're all empty.
Watches, pesticides?

26:50.710 --> 26:51.875
What's that

26:51.877 --> 26:53.277
on the floor?

26:53.279 --> 26:54.912
(shutter clicks)

26:54.914 --> 26:56.013
Castor beans.

26:56.015 --> 26:57.214
Talk to me, Spike.

26:57.216 --> 26:59.883
Castor beans and pesticides:
major components

26:59.885 --> 27:00.985
in both ricin and sarin.

27:00.987 --> 27:02.470
Nerve gas.

27:02.471 --> 27:03.954
Fire extinguishers
hold compressed gas.

27:03.956 --> 27:04.855
Watch is a timer.

27:04.857 --> 27:06.757
He's made a chemical bomb,

27:06.759 --> 27:08.392
and it's already out there.

27:16.302 --> 27:17.901
PARKER:
Sam.

27:17.903 --> 27:19.903
How is he?

27:19.905 --> 27:22.139
Davis? Davis, I'm
Sergeant Parker.

27:22.141 --> 27:24.241
How you doing?
You doing okay?

27:24.243 --> 27:27.277
Look, I want you to know that
you're safe-- we're not gonna

27:27.279 --> 27:28.912
let anything happen
to you, okay?

27:28.914 --> 27:31.682
But we could really use
your help right now.

27:31.684 --> 27:33.984
We know that you made some
kind of chemical bomb,

27:33.986 --> 27:35.953
and we need to know
where it is.

27:37.256 --> 27:39.256
Davis, a bomb
like that

27:39.258 --> 27:41.291
could kill a lot of
innocent people.

27:41.293 --> 27:43.427
I don't think we're
gonna get anything

27:43.429 --> 27:44.962
out of him.

27:44.964 --> 27:47.131
Get him to the hospital,
regulate his meds.

27:47.133 --> 27:49.967
Keep an eye on Mr. Lagosto--
when he becomes coherent,

27:49.969 --> 27:52.436
you question him
again, okay?

27:52.438 --> 27:55.706
Eddie, couldn't get anything.

27:55.708 --> 27:57.708
You need to tear
that place apart

27:57.710 --> 27:59.977
and figure out where
his next target may have been.

27:59.979 --> 28:02.413
Let the social worker Clive
know that he's there, he's safe,

28:02.415 --> 28:04.381
but he's gonna need his help
at the hospital.

28:04.383 --> 28:06.050
Boss, the social worker's
not here.

28:06.052 --> 28:07.418
Boss, I got something.

28:07.420 --> 28:08.952
All right, I'm on my way.

28:12.358 --> 28:14.024
JULES:
I'm right here,
Steve, okay?

28:14.026 --> 28:16.026
I'm coming with you.

28:16.028 --> 28:17.428
Nah, nah-hah, you don't have
to come with me.

28:17.430 --> 28:18.863
You're going
into surgery.

28:18.864 --> 28:20.297
You need somebody there
when you wake up.

28:20.298 --> 28:21.731
Yeah, there's a bomb out there.
That team needs you.

28:21.734 --> 28:22.433
Are you sure?

28:22.435 --> 28:23.767
Yeah. I'll be all right.

28:23.769 --> 28:25.402
Okay, I'm gonna come by later.

28:25.404 --> 28:28.439
(siren approaching)

28:30.876 --> 28:33.911
(Steve grunts)

28:33.913 --> 28:35.779
You better suit up.

28:35.781 --> 28:37.047
Yeah.

28:37.983 --> 28:39.883
I got into Davis' computer.

28:39.885 --> 28:41.952
Those threats against Riyaz?
They're in Davis' outbox, but

28:41.954 --> 28:44.221
they're not in his
"sent" mail folder.
What does that mean, Spike?

28:44.223 --> 28:46.156
It means someone was using his
computer as a proxy server.

28:46.158 --> 28:47.758
Davis didn't send those threats.

28:47.760 --> 28:49.760
Someone was setting him up.
Can you trace it?

28:49.762 --> 28:52.896
I'm running
a tunneling program right now.

28:52.898 --> 28:54.231
Clive Irwin.

28:54.233 --> 28:55.466
His social worker.

28:55.468 --> 28:58.836
So why would Clive want
to frame Davis?

28:58.838 --> 29:00.137
Eddie?

29:00.139 --> 29:01.806
Boss?

29:01.807 --> 29:03.474
Clive is now a person
of interest.

29:09.515 --> 29:10.981
Wordy, let's get this open.

29:10.983 --> 29:12.049
Copy.

29:22.762 --> 29:24.228
Boss, looks like Clive's been
conducting

29:24.230 --> 29:26.530
his own investigation
of Mr. Fayad.

29:26.532 --> 29:28.532
Who'd you find?

29:28.533 --> 29:30.533
We got articles
on domestic terrorism,

29:30.536 --> 29:31.835
surveillance photos

29:31.837 --> 29:33.771
on Mr. Fayad
and other Muslims.

29:33.773 --> 29:35.506
Suspected cell members.

29:35.508 --> 29:37.808
Clive's the one who's paranoid
about terrorism.

29:37.810 --> 29:39.042
I think I know why.

29:39.044 --> 29:40.778
Clive's wife was killed
in the London terror

29:40.780 --> 29:42.012
attacks a few years ago.

29:42.014 --> 29:44.548
WOMAN:
Clive never got over
losing his wife.

29:44.550 --> 29:47.084
Did he ever discuss it
with Davis?

29:47.086 --> 29:48.318
Oh, it's funny.

29:48.320 --> 29:50.220
He never talked
about it to anyone,

29:50.222 --> 29:52.122
and then a few
months ago

29:52.124 --> 29:53.524
they were playing chess...

29:53.526 --> 29:56.493
When the bomb went off,
the train split in half.

29:56.495 --> 30:00.030
She was thrown onto the tracks.

30:00.032 --> 30:03.200
I tried to go to her,
but I couldn't stand up.

30:03.202 --> 30:06.003
Both my legs were broken.

30:08.541 --> 30:11.241
I didn't know
if she was alive or dead.

30:14.246 --> 30:16.814
Her face was
turned away.

30:16.816 --> 30:20.918
(voice breaking):
I just kept calling her name.

30:23.122 --> 30:26.023
I'm almost convinced
it's been a bad dream.

30:28.594 --> 30:30.828
(sobs softly)

30:38.170 --> 30:41.605
They say that Riyaz Fayad was
connected

30:41.607 --> 30:42.973
to those suicide bombers.

30:42.975 --> 30:47.177
There must be a way
to stop him.

30:52.251 --> 30:54.284
I mean, you can't
blame Clive

30:54.286 --> 30:57.120
for how he feels.

30:57.122 --> 30:59.223
Okay, thank you.

31:02.394 --> 31:03.861
Did you get all that?

31:03.863 --> 31:05.929
Yeah. Sounds like Clive's been
whispering

31:05.931 --> 31:07.497
in Davis' ear for months.

31:07.499 --> 31:09.399
Feeding his paranoia
about an attack

31:09.401 --> 31:10.968
and convincing him
to build a bomb.

31:10.970 --> 31:12.569
Well, Davis probably had no idea

31:12.571 --> 31:14.404
his friend was using him
as a weapon.

31:14.406 --> 31:15.873
Setting him up to take the fall.

31:15.875 --> 31:17.207
One of the residents said

31:17.209 --> 31:19.042
they saw Clive driving
away 20 minutes ago.

31:19.044 --> 31:21.178
Where'd he go?
No idea, just said
he's moving fast.

31:21.180 --> 31:24.348
Well, if he was using Davis
to keep his own hands clean,

31:24.350 --> 31:25.649
why would he take
the bomb himself?

31:25.651 --> 31:27.651
'Cause Davis can't now,
and the job isn't done.

31:27.653 --> 31:29.553
It's gotta be the mosque,
remember?

31:29.555 --> 31:31.038
Clive didn't just
threaten Riyaz.

31:31.039 --> 31:32.522
He said "You and
your followers
are gonna get

31:32.524 --> 31:33.957
a taste
of your own medicine."

31:33.959 --> 31:36.026
He thinks it's their base
of operations.

31:36.028 --> 31:37.094
Lawrence and
Avenue Road.

31:37.096 --> 31:40.014
PARKER:
Let's go, let's move!

31:40.015 --> 31:42.933
WINNIE:
Clive's car's been spotted in
the parking lot of the mosque.

31:48.173 --> 31:50.908
(man intoning prayer in Arabic)

31:59.251 --> 32:01.351
(prayer continues)

32:07.493 --> 32:09.559
(prayer continues)

32:21.307 --> 32:23.340
Sergeant Parker?
Yeah?

32:23.342 --> 32:24.675
Dr. Zelovitsky,
I'm with HAZMAT.
How are you?

32:24.677 --> 32:26.209
I'm heading up
the medical team.

32:26.211 --> 32:28.378
Any idea what kind of toxin
we're dealing with?

32:28.380 --> 32:29.802
Could be a nerve agent,

32:29.803 --> 32:31.225
maybe a derivative of ricin
or sarin.

32:31.226 --> 32:32.648
It's hard to be specific,
'cause it's a home brew.

32:32.651 --> 32:34.518
We need to prepare
for hemorrhaging,

32:34.520 --> 32:35.652
convulsions,
even fatalities.

32:35.654 --> 32:38.088
Let's hope
it doesn't come to that.

32:38.090 --> 32:39.623
We'll be ready.
Thank you.

32:39.625 --> 32:41.658
Okay, Spike, what do we got?

32:41.660 --> 32:43.393
Looks like Davis outfitted
the extinguishers

32:43.395 --> 32:44.561
with artificial heads.

32:44.563 --> 32:46.029
He presses a
manual detonator,

32:46.030 --> 32:47.496
and the cylinder will
blow, releasing the gas.

32:47.499 --> 32:50.500
Okay. Can you disarm it?
Yeah, if we find
it in time.

32:50.502 --> 32:52.669
If we evacuate, it'll tip him
off; he could release the toxin.

32:52.671 --> 32:54.104
Okay.
Absolute stealth, guys

32:54.106 --> 32:56.039
Spike, Wordy,
you take the back.

32:56.041 --> 32:57.240
Sam and Jules, west.

32:57.242 --> 32:59.309
Boss, let's take east.
Let's move it.

33:08.187 --> 33:10.620
Okay, baby.

33:10.622 --> 33:12.389
You go ahead.
Mommy will be right over, okay?

33:16.595 --> 33:19.096
(prayer continues)

33:19.098 --> 33:21.465
(people praying quietly)

33:21.467 --> 33:23.100
(prayer continues)

33:23.102 --> 33:25.769
Um, can I help you?

33:25.771 --> 33:28.005
(prayer continues)

33:28.774 --> 33:31.341
Can I help you?

33:31.343 --> 33:33.643
(prayer continues)

33:36.715 --> 33:38.215
Masks on.

33:38.217 --> 33:39.783
Yeah.

34:00.539 --> 34:02.205
SAM:
I have a visual.

34:02.207 --> 34:03.473
PARKER:
Where?

34:04.476 --> 34:05.776
Looks like the prayer room.

34:05.778 --> 34:06.994
Does he have the bomb?

34:06.995 --> 34:08.211
Affirmative.
I have the solution.

34:08.213 --> 34:09.746
SPIKE:
Sam?

34:09.748 --> 34:11.715
Hold fire. If the bomb
hits the floor, it'll blow.

34:11.717 --> 34:13.216
ED:
Spike, shut down

34:13.218 --> 34:14.785
the ventilation system.
If the toxin's released,

34:14.787 --> 34:16.353
we can keep it contained.

34:16.355 --> 34:18.221
Copy that.

34:18.223 --> 34:20.090
I'm going on in.

34:24.096 --> 34:25.095
Police!

34:25.097 --> 34:26.463
(gasping)

34:26.465 --> 34:28.065
Police!
SRU!

34:28.067 --> 34:29.499
Police!

34:29.501 --> 34:31.268
Right there.
Everybody, exit the building.

34:31.270 --> 34:33.336
Everyone exit the building now.

34:33.338 --> 34:35.172
Exit the room now!
Do it now!

34:36.842 --> 34:38.992
Nobody move!

34:38.993 --> 34:41.143
Or I'll set off
this bomb right now!
PARKER: Clive!

34:42.681 --> 34:44.681
Clive. Just put it down.

34:44.683 --> 34:46.183
Put it down,

34:46.185 --> 34:48.251
and move away slowly.

34:48.253 --> 34:50.720
I don't expect you
to believe me.

34:50.722 --> 34:53.423
Someone has to stop them.

34:53.424 --> 34:56.125
PARKER: But will you just listen
closely to what I have to say

34:56.128 --> 34:58.562
before you do anything
that you might regret here?

34:58.564 --> 35:03.333
ATU, Anti-Terrorist Unit,
fully investigated Riyaz Fayad

35:03.335 --> 35:06.136
and the others of this mosque,
and they've been cleared.

35:06.138 --> 35:07.671
No, they haven't!

35:07.673 --> 35:09.172
Don't play games with me.

35:09.174 --> 35:10.340
They have.

35:10.342 --> 35:12.609
None of them have links
to the terrorists

35:12.611 --> 35:14.344
that were responsible
for your wife's death.

35:14.346 --> 35:17.247
Clive, you push that button,
and you're going to die here.

35:17.249 --> 35:18.615
Is that what you really want?

35:20.686 --> 35:22.419
Is that what Laura would want?

35:27.159 --> 35:28.625
(sighs)

35:28.627 --> 35:29.893
If that's what it takes.

35:29.895 --> 35:32.295
Put it down.

35:33.699 --> 35:35.198
Clive!

35:35.200 --> 35:37.868
(hissing)

35:37.870 --> 35:39.903
(panicked clamoring)
ED:
Everybody clear the building!

35:39.905 --> 35:43.340
Clear the building!
Everybody clear the building!

35:49.481 --> 35:52.249
Everybody out now!
Hustle through the doors
as quickly as you can!

35:52.251 --> 35:54.518
CASHMIRA:
Sayid! Sayid!

35:54.520 --> 35:56.286
Sayid!

35:56.288 --> 35:57.821
Please, I have to find Sayid.

35:57.823 --> 35:59.322
(screaming and murmuring)

35:59.324 --> 36:00.824
Come on, out this way.
That's it.

36:00.826 --> 36:03.193
That's it. Let's go.
Everybody out! Out!

36:03.195 --> 36:05.495
Go! Go! Go! Go!
(sobbing)

36:05.497 --> 36:07.264
Move it! Move it!

36:07.266 --> 36:09.366
Wordy, we got to get to Sayid.
Let's go!

36:12.838 --> 36:14.437
We need these people contained.

36:14.439 --> 36:15.672
Everyone needs
to be sprayed down.

36:15.674 --> 36:16.873
That includes you.

36:16.875 --> 36:19.176
I hear you, Doc.
As soon as everyone's safe.

36:19.178 --> 36:20.510
Head straight over
to the blue tents.

36:20.512 --> 36:21.661
Watch your step.

36:21.662 --> 36:22.811
People will be there
to help you.

36:22.814 --> 36:24.381
Keep going! Keep going!

36:24.383 --> 36:26.183
Go! Go! Let's go!

36:26.185 --> 36:27.484
Get out of here!

36:29.354 --> 36:32.355
(gasping, coughing)

36:32.357 --> 36:36.493
PARKER:
All right, Team One, full sweep
for anyone left inside.

36:36.495 --> 36:38.295
Sayid!

36:38.297 --> 36:41.298
Sayid! Sayid!

36:41.300 --> 36:42.899
Come on.

36:42.901 --> 36:44.334
I got you. I got you.

36:44.336 --> 36:45.669
Come on.
Let's go.

36:50.976 --> 36:52.309
We need some help.

36:52.311 --> 36:53.443
Let's go!

36:53.445 --> 36:54.778
Let's go, right here!

36:54.780 --> 36:56.313
Come on! Doc!
Oh, my God, Sayid!

36:56.315 --> 36:58.381
Oh, my God.
It's okay. Doc.

36:58.383 --> 37:00.350
CASHMIRA:
Is he going
to be okay?

37:00.352 --> 37:02.352
Baby!

37:02.354 --> 37:03.987
Resps are shallow. I need
five milligrams of Atropine.

37:03.989 --> 37:06.323
Please, please, please...
They're doing
everything they can.

37:06.325 --> 37:07.508
They're doing
everything they can.

37:07.509 --> 37:08.692
Sayid, baby, Mommy's right here.
Come on!

37:08.694 --> 37:09.926
Mommy's right here, baby.
Come on! Let's go!

37:09.928 --> 37:11.595
Please. He's just a baby.

37:40.892 --> 37:42.959
Finished my report.
Thanks, buddy.

37:45.397 --> 37:47.764
I hear you made a call
on Riyaz's behalf.

37:47.766 --> 37:49.299
Yeah.

37:49.301 --> 37:51.434
Boss, he only threatened us
because he was scared.

37:51.436 --> 37:53.303
He thought we
were the rendition squad.

37:53.305 --> 37:54.871
He saw what he feared the most.

37:54.873 --> 37:56.906
And he wasn't
the only one today

37:56.908 --> 37:59.576
who saw something
that wasn't there.

37:59.578 --> 38:02.545
Hey. Update from the hospital.

38:02.547 --> 38:04.414
Five people still
in serious condition,

38:04.416 --> 38:05.515
but they're expected
to pull through.

38:05.517 --> 38:06.850
What about the boy, Sayid?

38:06.852 --> 38:08.385
Doing okay.

38:09.554 --> 38:10.687
Thanks, Spike.

38:10.689 --> 38:12.489
Yeah.

38:38.717 --> 38:40.950
¶ ¶

39:03.842 --> 39:06.009
¶ ¶

39:16.521 --> 39:19.022
¶ ¶

39:37.642 --> 39:39.743
Hey.

39:42.047 --> 39:43.446
How you feeling?

39:43.448 --> 39:46.149
Better... now.

39:50.689 --> 39:52.389
Can I just say something?

39:52.391 --> 39:54.457
Sure.

39:54.459 --> 39:55.959
Last few months,

39:55.961 --> 39:58.661
uh, doing a lot of thinking.

40:00.599 --> 40:03.600
Just about, uh, the big picture.

40:03.602 --> 40:05.101
Yeah, I have, too.

40:05.103 --> 40:06.503
Just family.

40:07.906 --> 40:09.739
Future and stuff.

40:12.411 --> 40:13.643
(clears throat)

40:13.645 --> 40:17.747
And what I'm guessing is, uh,

40:17.749 --> 40:20.083
our big pictures
aren't the same.

40:22.954 --> 40:26.489
'Cause you're in mine,
but, uh...

40:28.693 --> 40:30.760
I don't think I'm in yours.

40:34.065 --> 40:37.033
Hey.

40:37.035 --> 40:39.202
It's okay.

40:39.204 --> 40:40.937
It's all good.

40:40.939 --> 40:44.607
There's no regrets.

40:44.609 --> 40:48.011
Well, almost no regrets.

40:48.013 --> 40:49.979
What do you mean?

40:49.981 --> 40:52.182
Never got to finish
our ice cream.

40:52.184 --> 40:53.650
(both chuckle)

40:53.652 --> 40:56.019
(groans)

40:56.021 --> 40:58.087
Shh.

41:00.158 --> 41:03.460
¶ Do you hear me
when I speak of you? ¶

41:03.462 --> 41:04.594
Just one favor.

41:04.596 --> 41:07.464
Anything.

41:07.466 --> 41:08.865
Promise me...

41:08.867 --> 41:10.467
¶ Do you feel me ¶

41:10.469 --> 41:12.502
...keep singing.

41:12.504 --> 41:14.537
¶ Loving you? ¶

41:14.539 --> 41:16.005
Yeah.

41:16.007 --> 41:19.542
¶ Did you see me?
'Cause I see you ¶

41:21.613 --> 41:23.480
¶ But it's good-bye ¶

41:23.482 --> 41:25.782
¶ Good-bye ¶

41:25.784 --> 41:30.153
¶ Good-bye, good-bye ¶

41:30.155 --> 41:34.224
¶ Good-bye, good-bye again. ¶
