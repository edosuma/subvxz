WEBVTT

00:01.836 --> 00:03.235
-We've got...
-We've got a show?

00:03.337 --> 00:04.937
It's going to be fun
to see you lift those.

00:06.607 --> 00:07.806
You want a job?

00:08.709 --> 00:09.942
You know your volkswagens.

00:10.044 --> 00:12.611
I'll be here all weekend,
guys. Still raining.

00:12.713 --> 00:14.613
It's got strawberries
and whipped cream.

00:14.715 --> 00:17.049
You guys have any
<i> days of thunder</i> memorabilia?

00:17.151 --> 00:18.650
Car [bleep] m&ms
out the back.

00:18.753 --> 00:21.587
Once upon a time there was
an edsel ranger two-door.

00:21.689 --> 00:23.355
-[man]<i> a big round</i>
<i> of applause for them.</i>
-[crowd cheering]

00:23.457 --> 00:25.557
they did our
builder's choice top ten.

00:26.160 --> 00:28.494
[tires squeal]

00:28.596 --> 00:30.295
oh. Oh. Oh.
Oh. Oh. Oh.

00:30.398 --> 00:31.697
I thought we were friends.

00:34.435 --> 00:35.901
[dave]<i> when I look</i>
<i> at a blank canvas,</i>

00:36.003 --> 00:37.870
<i> I see endless possibilities.</i>

00:39.006 --> 00:40.539
<i> As the ideas come to mind,</i>

00:40.641 --> 00:43.008
<i> the lines</i>
<i> start to fall into place.</i>

00:43.110 --> 00:46.211
<i> And before you know it,</i>
<i> we have a bitchin' ride.</i>

00:47.815 --> 00:50.082
<i> A bitchin' ride</i>
<i> has intense color.</i>

00:50.184 --> 00:51.350
[man 1] this is gorgeous.

00:51.452 --> 00:52.785
[dave]<i> performance.</i>

00:52.887 --> 00:54.319
[man 2]<i> it's fantastic.</i>

00:54.422 --> 00:57.756
[dave]<i> stance.</i>
<i> Wheels. Sound.</i>

00:57.858 --> 01:00.392
<i> There's one thing that</i>
<i> makes our cars stand out.</i>

01:00.494 --> 01:02.995
<i> Ours are</i> bitchin' rides.

01:03.097 --> 01:05.431
-[man 1] well,
it never gets old.
-[man 2 laughing]

01:07.468 --> 01:09.001
-what up?
-What up dave?

01:09.103 --> 01:10.936
Not much. Just putting
a couple of last measurements

01:11.038 --> 01:12.838
and stuff
together for the bar and--

01:12.940 --> 01:15.407
-oh, cool.
-Yeah. Finally.

01:15.509 --> 01:17.576
[kevin]<i> so dave is building</i>
<i> this bar in his basement.</i>

01:17.678 --> 01:19.011
And you know, I was thinking,

01:19.113 --> 01:22.648
I never got him
a housewarming gift,
I never got him anything.

01:22.750 --> 01:23.982
I'm gonna make it right.

01:24.085 --> 01:25.984
-[exhales]
-so what's up?

01:26.087 --> 01:30.055
Hey, so uh, we've got a lot
of stuff obviously this
week, and, uh, we've got uh--

01:30.157 --> 01:31.056
because we've got a show.

01:31.158 --> 01:32.024
Car shows are back.

01:32.126 --> 01:33.325
And I can't wait for them.

01:33.427 --> 01:36.795
There supposedly might be
a little bit of uh, extra

01:36.897 --> 01:37.863
-work on our part.
-Okay.

01:37.965 --> 01:39.298
We might have to get uh,

01:39.400 --> 01:40.799
I know that we are gonna
need to get some barrels

01:40.901 --> 01:42.401
-or something to weigh
down the canopy.
-Okay.

01:42.503 --> 01:44.036
Because I think we might
get a little bit of weather.

01:44.138 --> 01:45.771
Always on the concrete, there.

01:45.873 --> 01:47.539
Yeah. So we'll figure
that one out.

01:47.641 --> 01:49.274
And then, uh,
so you and I will have to,

01:49.376 --> 01:51.143
we're the pro builder's
choice picks, obviously.

01:51.245 --> 01:52.511
-So we are going to have
to try and find...
-Ten awards.

01:52.613 --> 01:53.645
Yep, ten awards.

01:53.747 --> 01:55.914
Our friends at
goodguys have asked us

01:56.016 --> 01:59.451
to pick top-10 builder's
choice and we're pumped.

01:59.553 --> 02:01.353
We gonna have to try
and find a little bit of time,

02:01.455 --> 02:03.222
uh, to get out and take
a look at the car show

02:03.324 --> 02:04.656
and that's always,
I know,

02:04.758 --> 02:06.925
a little difficult,
but let's just see if we
can maybe get there

02:07.027 --> 02:09.294
a little early or whatever
so we can get a chance
to walk around.

02:09.396 --> 02:10.696
I'm not sweating.
I'm pumped.

02:10.798 --> 02:12.364
-I'm pumped too.
-You know how long it's been

02:12.466 --> 02:13.866
since we've been
to a car show. Too long.

02:13.968 --> 02:16.368
-Last goodguys in salt lake.
-Right.

02:16.470 --> 02:17.536
And the weather looks iffy,

02:17.638 --> 02:19.404
-but I think we are
going to be good.
-Yeah.

02:19.507 --> 02:20.772
We got ten awards to pick.

02:20.875 --> 02:22.774
I can't wait to see
all my car friends

02:22.877 --> 02:24.243
because it's been a while.

02:24.345 --> 02:26.145
I can't wait to just
be at a car show.

02:26.247 --> 02:27.479
-I know. Right.
-With a beer.

02:27.581 --> 02:29.414
Did you ever think
you would say that?

02:29.517 --> 02:30.616
No.

02:30.718 --> 02:32.718
After the last seven
or eight years.

02:32.820 --> 02:34.720
How busy we've been.
And now you are like...

02:34.822 --> 02:36.155
-I love car shows.
-So do I.

02:36.257 --> 02:38.056
I love being able to hang
out with my friends.

02:38.159 --> 02:39.858
And what about churros?

02:39.960 --> 02:42.394
Picking builder's choice
is always a great time.

02:42.496 --> 02:43.629
But it's a lot of work.

02:43.731 --> 02:45.330
We got to scour
the entire showgrounds.

02:45.432 --> 02:47.599
We've got to look at every
nook and cranny at the show.

02:47.701 --> 02:49.868
We've got to be in almost
three places at once.

02:49.970 --> 02:52.171
-It's gonna be awesome
to get back to the shows.
-Mm-hmm.

02:52.273 --> 02:53.772
But, um, one thing
I wanted to show you,

02:53.874 --> 02:55.841
I don't think you've seen it
because you just got back

02:55.943 --> 02:57.543
from vacation.
Hold it right there.

02:57.645 --> 03:00.445
We have something very special
in store for the winners.

03:00.548 --> 03:01.446
Don't move.
Don't look.

03:01.549 --> 03:02.714
-Can I sit in your chair?
-Nope. No.

03:02.816 --> 03:04.950
No, let me grab
one of these real quick.

03:05.052 --> 03:06.118
Don't look. Don't move.

03:06.220 --> 03:07.886
Am I supposed to...

03:07.988 --> 03:09.755
-Put your eyes on that.
-Oh, nice.

03:09.857 --> 03:12.791
-Is that rad or what?
-Oh, these are awesome.

03:12.893 --> 03:14.526
So, we have ten
of these, right?

03:14.628 --> 03:15.827
-For our picks.
-Yep.

03:15.930 --> 03:17.129
Nice.

03:17.231 --> 03:18.897
-Ah, those look great.
-Don't they?

03:18.999 --> 03:21.133
-That black nickel.
-You know what? You know
what's even more exciting?

03:21.235 --> 03:22.534
-What?
-Look, read the bottom.

03:23.771 --> 03:25.103
It has the year on it.

03:25.206 --> 03:28.106
Which means it's
actually gonna happen.

03:28.209 --> 03:30.342
Yeah, the only person that is
worried about that is you.

03:30.444 --> 03:31.610
-What? No I'm not.
-It's going to happen.

03:31.712 --> 03:32.744
Of course it's
going to happen.

03:32.846 --> 03:34.012
That's awesome.
I'm excited.

03:34.114 --> 03:35.480
-It's gonna be a great show.
-I'm excited.

03:35.583 --> 03:36.982
Those awards are amazing.

03:37.084 --> 03:39.751
-So we need to pick,
uh, top-10.
-Mm-hmm.

03:39.853 --> 03:41.920
And we'll get a chance to walk
around a little bit,

03:42.022 --> 03:43.422
you know, check out
some of this car show.

03:43.524 --> 03:45.524
It's going to be awesome
to get back to the car shows.

03:45.626 --> 03:46.758
I'm just gonna
be loading cars,

03:46.860 --> 03:48.860
I'm gonna be fasting all week,

03:48.963 --> 03:51.663
because I'm gonna be eating
all of the car show food.

03:51.765 --> 03:53.332
-All of it.
-You're going full carnie?

03:53.434 --> 03:54.466
Uh-huh. Full carnie.

04:01.508 --> 04:03.675
Well... Hope's up.

04:12.453 --> 04:13.685
Sweet.

04:13.787 --> 04:15.087
Looks like I've done
that before.

04:15.189 --> 04:16.722
It may have been awhile
since we've done

04:16.824 --> 04:19.558
one of these car shows,
but I put this rig together

04:19.660 --> 04:21.293
so many times
I could do it in my sleep.

04:21.395 --> 04:22.427
We can get the tent up.

04:22.529 --> 04:23.996
We are gonna get
the floor laid.

04:24.098 --> 04:25.264
We are gonna get everything
locked down,

04:25.366 --> 04:27.232
maybe start helping them
with the apparel stuff

04:27.334 --> 04:28.700
and then we'll bring
some cars down.

04:28.802 --> 04:31.403
[upbeat music playing]

04:39.480 --> 04:41.246
these go on the cross beams,
to the left.

04:46.820 --> 04:49.187
Today is a little bit windy,
and normally we would just

04:49.290 --> 04:51.356
screw into asphalt,
but since we are concrete

04:51.458 --> 04:53.058
we are going to have
to fill these containers up

04:53.160 --> 04:55.360
with water
to keep the canopy down.

04:55.462 --> 04:56.528
David.

04:56.630 --> 04:57.996
Listen.

04:58.098 --> 04:59.965
I, I want to start filling
these while we're putting
the canopy up

05:00.067 --> 05:01.466
because the wind is
blowing so we're gonna

05:01.568 --> 05:03.001
have to... Get this
thing ready.

05:03.103 --> 05:04.970
I think we have enough
hose to actually just put

05:05.072 --> 05:08.106
put the empty drums
into position and fill them
up in place.

05:08.208 --> 05:09.975
If I fill these
three right here,

05:10.077 --> 05:12.311
do you think you can
move them to the front
once they are full?

05:12.413 --> 05:13.412
Yeah.

05:13.514 --> 05:15.647
You're going to blow
your back out?

05:15.749 --> 05:16.782
-No. Easy.
-Okay.

05:16.884 --> 05:18.417
I'm gonna start filling them.

05:18.519 --> 05:20.786
It's gonna be fun to see
you lift those.

05:20.888 --> 05:23.488
If david can lift these
water barrels, I can too.

05:24.224 --> 05:25.390
I think.

05:25.492 --> 05:27.693
[zany music playing]

05:32.266 --> 05:33.632
it's like being
in a waterpark.

05:33.734 --> 05:35.767
I'm not exactly sure
what's going on here.

06:13.574 --> 06:15.607
I think kevin might just be
a little overexcited

06:15.709 --> 06:16.975
that the
show is about to start.

06:17.077 --> 06:19.344
I mean, it's been awhile since
we've been back to the show.

06:19.446 --> 06:20.479
Uh, who knows?

06:26.687 --> 06:28.220
The tent is up,
the cars are out.

06:28.322 --> 06:29.988
They look wonderful.
And you know what?

06:30.090 --> 06:31.323
People are starting
to show up.

06:31.425 --> 06:32.924
And that's exciting,
because it's been awhile

06:33.026 --> 06:34.459
since we've all
been to a great car show.

06:37.798 --> 06:39.064
Oh, so excited to be
at a car show.

06:39.166 --> 06:40.399
I'm, I'm telling you.

06:40.501 --> 06:41.867
All these cars
are starting to look
like we're

06:41.969 --> 06:43.135
gonna have
a beautiful weekend.

06:43.237 --> 06:44.936
It's a little cold, but I'm
hoping the weather holds out,

06:45.038 --> 06:46.505
though, because
I'm telling you right now

06:46.607 --> 06:48.006
the weather
is saying rain.

06:48.108 --> 06:49.775
-I'm not excited about that.
-I get it. I get it.

06:49.877 --> 06:50.942
But I'm still here.
I'm pumped.

06:51.044 --> 06:53.378
Well, we got the canopy
set up, the cars are set up.

06:53.480 --> 06:54.446
We're gonna be busy.

06:54.548 --> 06:55.847
We also need to start
looking at cars to pick.

06:55.949 --> 06:57.916
Because we are doing
builder's choice.

06:58.018 --> 07:00.285
Kevin and I have been chosen
to be the builder's choice

07:00.387 --> 07:02.888
judges, so we got to pick
the top ten cars.

07:02.990 --> 07:04.322
Yeah, beautiful car.

07:04.425 --> 07:05.690
Yeah, that's really nice.

07:08.495 --> 07:09.928
Have you ever seen
a shinier set

07:10.030 --> 07:11.863
of built especially
wheels?

07:12.466 --> 07:13.398
Only in the box.

07:14.568 --> 07:16.768
You just barely take those
out-of-the-box this morning?

07:18.405 --> 07:20.539
-Good color combo, too.
-I like it.

07:20.641 --> 07:22.574
[dave] this car looks
beautiful on the outside,

07:22.676 --> 07:25.210
and I'll tell you what,
the interior, it's not
so bad either.

07:25.312 --> 07:26.244
Is it a 406?

07:26.346 --> 07:27.846
-What do you stroke up to?
-Right here.

07:27.948 --> 07:30.849
Oh, 430.
Dart racing block.

07:30.951 --> 07:32.617
-Far out. [bleep].
-It'll be a rocket, too.

07:32.719 --> 07:33.652
Oh, yeah.

07:33.754 --> 07:35.353
Did I mention that
it's very bright?

07:35.456 --> 07:36.555
I might have to
get these checked.

07:36.657 --> 07:38.990
Are you retired? You just
polish this all of the time?

07:39.092 --> 07:41.026
-Or you still work?
-[man] still work.

07:41.128 --> 07:42.327
Nice detail.
Very nice detail.

07:42.429 --> 07:44.362
-Thank you.
-After looking at this car

07:44.465 --> 07:45.564
and seeing
how shiny it is,

07:45.666 --> 07:47.232
I only got one
question for the owner.

07:47.334 --> 07:48.300
You want a job?

07:49.136 --> 07:50.135
Okay.

07:50.804 --> 07:52.070
It was worth a shot.

07:52.172 --> 07:54.072
That was a beautiful car but
we are just getting started.

07:54.174 --> 07:56.374
And if that car is any kind
of indication of

07:56.477 --> 07:57.909
what we're gonna see
out here this weekend,

07:58.011 --> 07:59.911
well, we got our
work cut out for us.

08:00.013 --> 08:02.614
All right, now.
Now we're talking.

08:02.716 --> 08:04.049
-Dave, move it on.
-Wait for me.

08:05.319 --> 08:06.551
That's cool.

08:06.653 --> 08:09.387
Dave kindig always says
he's a vw expert.

08:09.490 --> 08:10.889
Let's test his knowledge.

08:10.991 --> 08:12.958
What year is it?
Eh! Eh!

08:13.060 --> 08:15.794
I'll tell you right now.
That's '63 and earlier.

08:15.896 --> 08:17.262
-Yep.
-'64 and earlier, rather.

08:17.364 --> 08:19.331
'65 would have had a
smaller window frame.

08:19.433 --> 08:20.398
Okay.
You're on the right track.

08:20.501 --> 08:23.401
Judging from the taillights,
'63 and earlier,

08:23.504 --> 08:24.970
because it's got
the pulp nose.

08:25.072 --> 08:27.205
But it can't be, because it's
got the smaller taillights.

08:27.307 --> 08:30.308
Now we are down to
'61 and earlier.

08:30.410 --> 08:32.611
-Oh you're getting...
You're right there.
-Hold on. Hold on.

08:32.713 --> 08:34.312
I'm gonna tell
you in a second.

08:35.349 --> 08:36.715
It's a 1960.

08:37.184 --> 08:38.350
Hold on a minute.

08:39.920 --> 08:40.919
No h.

08:41.021 --> 08:44.756
This is kind of like
the schoolteacher teaching

08:44.858 --> 08:47.125
the student.
Not the opposite.

08:47.227 --> 08:48.760
-You are right. Good job.
-Hey, thanks.

08:48.862 --> 08:49.794
You know
your volkswagens.

08:49.897 --> 08:52.063
I'll be here all
weekend, guys. [laughs]

08:56.570 --> 08:57.936
[dave] okay,
this is pretty cool.

08:58.038 --> 08:59.671
I've not seen anybody ever
do a two-tone

08:59.773 --> 09:01.873
where you've done this
car. Super unique.

09:01.975 --> 09:03.909
Look at this.
Look how trick that is.

09:04.011 --> 09:05.243
That is cool.

09:05.345 --> 09:07.245
[dave] one of my favorite
color combinations,
as you know,

09:07.347 --> 09:08.947
is red interior with the
dark exterior.

09:09.049 --> 09:11.716
This dark charcoal looks
beautiful with red interior.

09:11.818 --> 09:13.118
I like the colors, too.

09:13.220 --> 09:15.520
-Yeah.
-And I like, I like a lot
of the gray detail.

09:15.622 --> 09:17.289
-Satin? Yeah, this is rad.
-The satin gray detail.

09:17.391 --> 09:18.790
What, uh,
what motor you running?

09:18.892 --> 09:19.958
A 1940.

09:20.060 --> 09:21.393
[kevin] a volkswagen engine.

09:21.495 --> 09:22.627
[dave] stock.

09:22.729 --> 09:24.529
Love this car.
Killer stance.

09:25.065 --> 09:25.997
Bad-ass motor.

09:26.099 --> 09:27.365
You know, as a judge,

09:27.467 --> 09:28.500
we haven't seen
all of the cars yet,

09:28.602 --> 09:30.235
so it's a little
too early to pick,

09:30.337 --> 09:32.270
but this one,
it's going on my list.

09:32.372 --> 09:33.772
Yeah, this is...

09:33.874 --> 09:36.007
This is my speed. It's cool.

09:40.213 --> 09:42.380
<i> Being back in the car</i>
<i> show scene is awesome.</i>

09:42.482 --> 09:44.649
<i> Especially when</i>
<i> it's in your own town.</i>

09:44.751 --> 09:46.718
-Ken, man. Good to see you.
-How you been?

09:51.124 --> 09:53.124
And then, like that,

09:53.226 --> 09:54.259
car wash for everyone.

10:01.435 --> 10:03.868
What's our, uh,
what's our eta on the rain?

10:03.971 --> 10:05.870
I don't know.
Look at your phone.

10:05.973 --> 10:09.441
It went from sunny to rainy
faster than you can
say bitchin'.

10:10.711 --> 10:11.776
Still raining.

10:17.551 --> 10:19.217
It's been a long time
since we've been to a car show

10:19.319 --> 10:20.518
here in salt lake city.

10:20.621 --> 10:23.421
And certainly we had a very
dry winter and spring,

10:23.523 --> 10:26.691
so wouldn't it make perfect
sense, we go to a big car show

10:26.793 --> 10:28.293
and we are gonna finally
get some rain.

10:29.496 --> 10:30.729
Free car wash.

10:30.831 --> 10:33.898
Look at the positivity pouring
out of my skull.

10:34.001 --> 10:36.101
We are gonna have rain on
and off all day long.

10:36.203 --> 10:39.437
Typically when it rains like
this, I look for a cover.

10:39.539 --> 10:42.040
Fortunately for this show
out here at the fairgrounds,

10:42.142 --> 10:43.642
there is an indoor
car show as well.

10:43.744 --> 10:44.943
Maybe we'll stay dry in there.

10:48.048 --> 10:49.481
-Oh!
-Looks like there's some
nice cars in here.

10:49.583 --> 10:51.583
And they are dry.
Rain, sleet, snow,

10:51.685 --> 10:53.051
fires.
Doesn't matter.

10:53.153 --> 10:55.020
There's a car show
and the show must go on.

10:55.122 --> 10:56.921
And there's some indoor cars.

10:57.024 --> 10:58.490
-I mean, we are dry.
-Wow, look at this.

11:01.662 --> 11:03.795
It's a little dark and gray
and gloomy outside,

11:03.897 --> 11:05.930
but it is sunny inside here.

11:06.033 --> 11:07.666
That really brighten
someone's day.

11:08.301 --> 11:09.734
Well, I guess so.

11:09.836 --> 11:12.170
-I love the big headlights.
-[kevin] oh, nice.

11:12.272 --> 11:14.539
That looks like a 351
or something like that.

11:14.641 --> 11:16.374
-[dave] far out.
-[kevin] it's a way nice car.

11:18.345 --> 11:19.978
I really like the
big boy whites.

11:20.080 --> 11:22.681
When you, when you first went
into business, 20 years ago,

11:22.783 --> 11:24.382
did you think you would
be building mostly

11:24.484 --> 11:25.583
cars like this?

11:26.520 --> 11:28.586
No, I would only hope.
Honestly.

11:28.689 --> 11:31.423
But it, it's just weird
the way the industry's
kind of changed.

11:31.525 --> 11:33.091
Because we really
don't build any cars
like this anymore.

11:33.193 --> 11:35.326
Not street rods.
Not as much anymore. No.

11:35.429 --> 11:36.494
And to be honest with you,

11:36.596 --> 11:38.430
I really actually like
driving a street rod.

11:38.532 --> 11:41.166
I think they are fun to look
at and drive and everything,

11:41.268 --> 11:43.468
but you know, muscle cars,
the big body cars,

11:43.570 --> 11:47.038
I mean, things have opened up
so much and different people's
takes on

11:47.140 --> 11:49.007
different genres
and everything else.

11:49.109 --> 11:51.042
I think, I think that's what
makes it interesting.

11:51.144 --> 11:53.211
Now let's take a,
let's take a look around here.

11:57.584 --> 11:59.751
It's a beautiful car, though.
Look at the wheels.

11:59.853 --> 12:00.685
Oh, yeah.

12:02.189 --> 12:03.722
So this is a
riddler great 8.

12:03.824 --> 12:06.458
<i> There is a few really</i>
<i> super high-end cars</i>
<i> inside the building.</i>

12:06.560 --> 12:08.727
<i> One of which is actually</i>
<i> a detroit autorama</i>

12:08.829 --> 12:09.694
<i> great 8 winner.</i>

12:09.796 --> 12:10.962
Called the old sled.

12:11.064 --> 12:12.731
This thing is bitchin'.

12:12.833 --> 12:14.699
Not copying.
Call research.

12:14.801 --> 12:17.035
Look how he floated that
seat right down.

12:17.137 --> 12:18.937
No gap underneath it.

12:19.039 --> 12:20.839
[dave]<i> to get into the detroit</i>
<i> autorama great 8,</i>

12:20.941 --> 12:22.407
<i> the car has to be</i>
<i> over-the-top.</i>

12:22.509 --> 12:25.443
<i>First time seen and first time</i>
<i> debuted at any car show.</i>

12:25.545 --> 12:26.978
<i> This car actually met</i>
<i> that criteria.</i>

12:27.080 --> 12:29.380
<i> And of course, to get there,</i>
<i> you got to have</i>

12:29.483 --> 12:32.217
some really cool one-off
stuff. The wheels are one-off.

12:32.319 --> 12:34.185
The chop.
The body work.

12:34.287 --> 12:36.654
-No, this is a neat,
neat piece.
-Cool car, though.

12:36.757 --> 12:37.922
So far we are just getting
started

12:38.024 --> 12:39.457
<i> looking at the car show.</i>

12:39.559 --> 12:41.926
It's starting to really
shape up to be a nice weekend.

12:42.028 --> 12:45.363
So, I seen this car pull
in today and he waved to me

12:45.465 --> 12:48.700
and I said hi and now I get
an opportunity to look

12:48.802 --> 12:50.869
at this car, it is sick.

12:53.840 --> 12:56.341
Sometimes everything comes
together on a big build

12:56.443 --> 12:58.376
and this is definitely
one of those.

12:59.112 --> 13:00.245
-Wow.
-I love these

13:00.347 --> 13:02.647
big body,
these big body fords.

13:02.749 --> 13:05.416
[kevin]<i> this is a big car</i>
<i> and everything looks</i>
<i> right on it.</i>

13:05.519 --> 13:07.485
<i> It doesn't look</i>
<i> wimpy or sissy.</i>

13:07.587 --> 13:09.154
It looks tough and manly.

13:09.256 --> 13:11.322
This has the same
dash as the truck.

13:11.424 --> 13:12.490
-Yeah. Mm-hmm.
-Kind of.

13:12.592 --> 13:14.926
[dave] yep. '59
and '60 impala.

13:15.028 --> 13:16.060
Yep.

13:16.163 --> 13:17.695
So you can see, when you--
if you look at it,

13:17.798 --> 13:19.898
you can see that,
that we did different gauges.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.332
I think we had to actually
shrink ours

13:21.434 --> 13:22.400
a little bit to get it in.

13:22.502 --> 13:23.868
[dave] because
of the length, yeah.

13:23.970 --> 13:25.970
Or they might have
stretched theirs.

13:26.072 --> 13:28.873
-[dave] uh, it looks pretty...
-That's the really cool
thing about these,

13:28.975 --> 13:32.277
is you can cut them
pretty easily and you
really can't tell.

13:32.379 --> 13:33.645
[dave] right.

13:33.747 --> 13:35.613
It's, it's cool.
What's in it for power?

13:37.083 --> 13:40.618
Everything about this galaxie
is looking awesome so far.

13:40.720 --> 13:42.954
But we haven't even seen
the jewelry box yet.

13:43.056 --> 13:44.556
-Looks like a coyote.
-Yep.

13:44.658 --> 13:46.991
[dave] you know,
with the coyote engine,
it's a perfect,

13:47.093 --> 13:47.926
clever name for this car.

13:48.028 --> 13:49.327
I like it.

13:49.429 --> 13:50.995
Wow.
Look at the satin pin.

13:51.097 --> 13:52.497
-I know.
-That's cool.

13:52.599 --> 13:54.265
[kevin] and looking at all
this bright work,

13:54.367 --> 13:56.167
I don't believe this is
really chromed over.

13:56.269 --> 13:57.268
[dave] no, I don't think so.

13:57.370 --> 13:58.770
[kevin] I'm like, I'm a huge
fan of doing that,

13:58.872 --> 14:02.040
I just think it makes it
look like a beautiful car.

14:02.943 --> 14:04.542
Like a show car.

14:04.644 --> 14:08.179
Beautiful car. I seen you
pulling with this thing
and it's just... [blows kiss]

14:08.281 --> 14:11.149
killer colors, stance.
I love the interior color.

14:11.251 --> 14:12.917
It's very beautiful.

14:13.019 --> 14:14.919
-You like the door handles?
-I do like the door handles.

14:15.021 --> 14:17.388
-They work all right for you?
-Yeah, they work great.

14:17.490 --> 14:19.991
And it has one feature
I can't quite see enough of.

14:20.093 --> 14:21.226
So cool.

14:24.898 --> 14:27.332
This '59 brookwood
is low, it's bitchin'.

14:27.434 --> 14:29.234
I love the stance
on this thing.

14:29.336 --> 14:31.536
You know what I always say.
The lower, the better.

14:32.272 --> 14:33.671
Down low.

14:33.773 --> 14:35.773
-Bad ass, dude.
-Yeah, brookwood.

14:35.876 --> 14:37.208
[dave] that, that is
the most subtle two-tone

14:37.310 --> 14:38.509
I think I've ever
seen in my life.

14:38.612 --> 14:40.712
I know, but it, it works.

14:40.814 --> 14:42.080
-I like it.
-Yeah.

14:42.182 --> 14:44.048
-And the dash is two-tone.
-Mm-hmm.

14:44.150 --> 14:45.683
[dave] look, and he made
the seats, too, from scratch.

14:45.785 --> 14:47.886
Because he's
channeled it so far.

14:47.988 --> 14:49.721
To sit this car
right down the ground.

14:49.823 --> 14:52.123
[stutters] and it sits right.

14:52.225 --> 14:55.293
[dave]<i> these massive</i>
<i> two-door station wagons</i>
<i> look awesome.</i>

14:55.395 --> 14:57.228
<i> This one is beautiful</i>
<i> with the blue paint, though.</i>

14:57.330 --> 14:59.597
<i> The engine bay is</i>
<i> beautifully detailed.</i>

14:59.699 --> 15:02.600
The interior is smoking hot,
and the stance, well,

15:02.702 --> 15:04.769
you don't get much
better than that.
Right on the ground.

15:04.871 --> 15:06.671
This is what I call
no-sell blue.

15:06.773 --> 15:08.239
Which means, I'm sold on it.

15:08.341 --> 15:09.440
I like it.

15:09.542 --> 15:11.709
I'm actually doing
one of the corvettes,

15:11.811 --> 15:13.578
a rendering, with this color.

15:13.680 --> 15:15.713
Or something close
to this, anyway.

15:15.815 --> 15:18.583
And, uh, but I love the little
bit of flop violet to it.

15:18.685 --> 15:20.852
And it goes almost
silver on, on the backside.

15:20.954 --> 15:22.220
It's not too light.

15:22.322 --> 15:24.522
My dad, my dad had
a volkswagen that
was painted

15:24.624 --> 15:26.324
-really close to this color.
Mm-hmm.
-Really?

15:26.426 --> 15:27.525
You know,
I'm kind of wondering if

15:27.627 --> 15:29.394
kevin will be able to
guess what engine this is.

15:29.729 --> 15:30.662
So...

15:31.298 --> 15:32.830
Name the engine.

15:32.933 --> 15:35.099
<i> I think dave is trying to get</i>
<i> a little revenge on me.</i>

15:35.201 --> 15:36.601
Putting me
on the spot on this engine.

15:36.703 --> 15:38.269
I don't know everything.

15:39.239 --> 15:40.605
-Well, it's a gm.
-Mm-hmm.

15:40.707 --> 15:41.839
-It's ls.
-Mm-hmm.

15:41.942 --> 15:43.474
You know how I can tell?

15:43.576 --> 15:44.609
Uh, the spread
on the exhaust?

15:44.711 --> 15:46.377
No, the crossover two bray
here in the front.

15:46.479 --> 15:48.012
-Oh.
-This is cool, though.

15:48.114 --> 15:50.114
[dave] I like this car. A lot.

15:50.216 --> 15:52.383
I have two
complaints about this car.

15:52.485 --> 15:54.552
The only thing I don't really
care about

15:54.654 --> 15:56.587
um, is that it's not
parked in my garage.

15:56.690 --> 15:58.222
That's all. Okay.

15:58.325 --> 16:00.124
I promised I wasn't
gonna cry today.

16:00.226 --> 16:01.659
One, it won't fit
in my garage.

16:01.761 --> 16:02.961
And two, it's not in there.

16:03.830 --> 16:05.897
[chuckling] wow.

16:08.802 --> 16:11.102
You know that they put
an ls in a ford truck.

16:11.204 --> 16:12.437
Look at these lines, dave.

16:12.539 --> 16:16.040
Putting an ls in a ford,
some people may frown upon it.

16:16.509 --> 16:17.942
I think it's fine.

16:18.044 --> 16:19.944
[dave] that is super clean.

16:20.046 --> 16:22.847
Like, it's got that
little bulge over
the fuel rails there.

16:22.949 --> 16:25.083
-That's just enough just to
hide that stuff. That's cool.
-Mm-hmm.

16:25.185 --> 16:26.384
Unibody.

16:26.486 --> 16:27.952
-Oh, yeah.
-Mm-hmm.

16:28.054 --> 16:30.154
[dave]<i> you know,</i>
<i> the very early '60s,</i>
<i>ford tried out what they would</i>

16:30.256 --> 16:31.689
<i> call a unibody</i>
<i> where the bed</i>

16:31.791 --> 16:33.391
<i> was not separated</i>
<i> from the cab.</i>

16:33.493 --> 16:35.760
This is a very unique
and cool looking truck.

16:35.862 --> 16:37.962
And not only that, it makes
the perfect hot rod.

16:38.064 --> 16:39.030
Well, look at the interior.

16:39.132 --> 16:40.465
I love those ribs.

16:40.567 --> 16:41.632
[dave] yeah.

16:41.735 --> 16:44.002
Remember when we did
that on harold's truck.

16:44.104 --> 16:45.636
-Mm-hmm.
-[dave] yep.

16:45.739 --> 16:46.671
[kevin] such a clean interior.

16:46.773 --> 16:48.706
[dave] nice, clean dash.
I really like this.

16:48.808 --> 16:50.508
[kevin] I really like
the orange stitching

16:50.610 --> 16:52.810
-across the front, too.
Gives it just a little bit...
-Mm-hmm.

16:52.912 --> 16:54.679
[dave] this shop
we are very familiar with.

16:54.781 --> 16:56.447
They built an awesome vehicle
and they took lots of time

16:56.549 --> 16:58.983
to make sure the details were
perfect on this truck.

16:59.085 --> 17:01.219
It's really cool because
it carries this theme.

17:01.321 --> 17:03.154
You know, you have these,
you have this strips
in the bed.

17:03.256 --> 17:05.123
-[dave] mm-hmm.
-And you have the
strips in the interior.

17:05.225 --> 17:06.491
-Right.
-So it kind of carries
that through.

17:06.593 --> 17:08.493
Flush mount glass.
That's another nice trick.

17:08.595 --> 17:11.029
Oh, yeah. Good eye.
Good catch.

17:11.131 --> 17:14.599
<i> I love these early</i>
<i> '60s ford trucks.</i>

17:14.701 --> 17:15.767
<i> They are amazing.</i>

17:15.869 --> 17:18.136
Well, they just get better
and better every year.

17:18.705 --> 17:19.670
Yep.

17:20.507 --> 17:21.672
Yeah, that is sweet.

17:29.115 --> 17:30.515
[kevin]<i> we've seen</i>
<i> some cool stuff.</i>

17:30.617 --> 17:31.849
The show is just
getting started.

17:31.951 --> 17:34.218
[exhales]<i> I think my insides</i>
<i> are eating my insides.</i>

17:34.320 --> 17:35.887
I'm hungry.

17:35.989 --> 17:38.890
Cookies and cream.
Maple bacon.

17:42.862 --> 17:46.064
Cookies and cream.
Maple bacon.

17:46.166 --> 17:48.399
Oh, I think I'm gonna get
that banana one, though.

17:48.501 --> 17:50.768
Mm, or strawberry pie. Mm.

17:51.271 --> 17:52.437
<i> First car show.</i>

17:52.539 --> 17:53.971
It's in our own backyard.

17:54.074 --> 17:56.240
And of course,
it decides to rain.

17:56.342 --> 17:58.976
I'm gonna get all of them.
Can I have one of everything?

17:59.079 --> 18:01.779
What better way to get
past some bad weather

18:01.881 --> 18:03.081
than doughnuts on a stick?

18:06.419 --> 18:07.585
Thank you.

18:07.687 --> 18:09.153
Dude, look at that.

18:09.255 --> 18:12.824
It's got strawberries and
whipped cream and then this,

18:12.926 --> 18:14.325
like, frosting source.

18:14.427 --> 18:18.296
Tastes like a toaster strudel.

18:18.398 --> 18:19.530
But better.

18:21.067 --> 18:23.334
<i>Yeah, so dave was putting this</i>
<i> bar together in his house.</i>

18:23.436 --> 18:24.802
<i> I really need</i>
<i> to get him a gift.</i>

18:24.904 --> 18:27.004
<i> I want to make sure that</i>
<i> every time he looks at it</i>

18:27.540 --> 18:28.773
it reminds him of me.

18:28.875 --> 18:31.609
So I'm thinking, since I'm
probably gonna want to spend

18:31.711 --> 18:34.011
most of my money
on doughnuts this year,

18:34.114 --> 18:35.246
I'm gonna go
to the swap meet

18:35.348 --> 18:37.181
because I'll probably
find something cheaper.

18:37.283 --> 18:40.418
<i>There's no better place to get</i>
<i> a gift for a guy like</i>

18:40.520 --> 18:42.687
dave kindig than at
a swap meet.

18:52.999 --> 18:55.166
It's kind of slim
pickings at this swap meet,

18:55.268 --> 18:57.435
<i> but I did see one thing</i>
<i> that caught my eye.</i>

18:57.537 --> 18:59.537
It would be
great for dave's bar.

18:59.639 --> 19:01.105
I know dave
collects beanie babies.

19:01.207 --> 19:03.074
I wonder
if he collects furbys?

19:03.176 --> 19:04.442
How much is the furby?

19:04.878 --> 19:05.910
[man speaking]

19:06.012 --> 19:07.145
is that true?

19:08.414 --> 19:10.715
Na-uh.
Get out of here!

19:10.817 --> 19:12.383
It's for dave.
I'm on a budget.

19:12.485 --> 19:14.318
I want to do
something really nice,

19:14.420 --> 19:15.686
but I definitely
have my limits.

19:18.625 --> 19:20.291
That's freaky.
I don't like that.

19:20.393 --> 19:22.126
You guys have any
volkswagen stuff?

19:22.228 --> 19:24.662
Do you guys have any
<i> days of thunder</i> memorabilia?

19:24.764 --> 19:26.230
[man 1] yeah.
All kinds of stuff.

19:26.332 --> 19:27.899
-Do you?
-[man 2] yeah.

19:28.001 --> 19:30.234
Where is it at?
That's my favorite movie.

19:30.336 --> 19:32.770
Actually, do you have
any volkswagen stuff?

19:32.872 --> 19:34.338
I'm looking for a gift
for my friend.

19:34.440 --> 19:36.307
<i> I haven't really found</i>
<i> anything that's</i>

19:36.409 --> 19:37.875
<i> just perfect for dave.</i>

19:37.977 --> 19:39.043
There is more to see.

19:39.145 --> 19:41.746
"this powerful free-spirited
clydesdale symbolizes

19:41.848 --> 19:47.018
the rich tradition
and quality that
goes into brewing bud light."

19:47.120 --> 19:48.519
how much for this?

19:48.621 --> 19:49.754
[man] 20 bucks.

19:49.856 --> 19:51.389
-20 bucks.
-It lights up.

19:51.491 --> 19:53.524
It's a night light
for your bedroom.

19:53.626 --> 19:56.027
I just, I'm trying to find
a gift for my friend.

19:56.129 --> 19:57.995
[man 1] oh, it's got a little
light in the front.

19:58.097 --> 19:59.764
At night, it lights up.

19:59.866 --> 20:01.632
He, he drinks bud light.
He thinks it's the greatest.

20:01.734 --> 20:04.135
-I mean, I don't agree.
-I've sold three or four.

20:04.237 --> 20:07.672
I have, yeah, I had three
of them I've sold.

20:07.774 --> 20:09.607
That's definitely it.
He's gonna love this light.

20:09.709 --> 20:11.676
It's time to start
wheeling and dealing.

20:11.778 --> 20:13.211
-Can I get it for 12?
-No.

20:13.313 --> 20:14.412
Can I get it for ten?

20:15.014 --> 20:16.113
How about 25?

20:16.216 --> 20:18.082
[bleep].
This bickering is tough.

20:18.751 --> 20:19.817
18?

20:20.787 --> 20:21.886
You're firm at 20.

20:21.988 --> 20:23.254
This guy drives a
hard bargain.

20:23.356 --> 20:25.356
He really knows what he has.
Don't low-ball this guy.

20:25.458 --> 20:26.591
Yeah, I'll take it.

20:26.693 --> 20:27.959
This is definitely on the
high end

20:28.061 --> 20:30.228
of what I wanted to spend
on dave.

20:30.330 --> 20:31.896
How much are those
m&m cars?

20:31.998 --> 20:33.231
I mean, it's dave's happiness.

20:34.801 --> 20:36.200
All right, kev.
What is all of that?

20:36.302 --> 20:37.735
Dave, dave, listen.

20:37.837 --> 20:39.003
I'm super excited.

20:39.105 --> 20:41.038
I've been walking
around all day

20:41.140 --> 20:43.207
to find you
a couple of presents. Okay.

20:43.309 --> 20:44.375
-Oh, cool.
-Yeah.

20:44.477 --> 20:47.278
[dave]<i> so, I'm here trying</i>
<i> to hold this tent down</i>

20:47.380 --> 20:49.013
to make sure that everything
doesn't get soaking wet

20:49.115 --> 20:51.382
and kevin apparently
is out buying junk.

20:51.484 --> 20:53.551
I saw this,
and I like
m&ms,

20:53.653 --> 20:55.786
-and this reminds me...
-It makes me hungry.

20:55.888 --> 20:58.489
This reminds me of us
because you have glasses on

20:58.591 --> 21:01.492
and I don't and I'm the one
that always hands out
the m&ms.

21:01.594 --> 21:02.827
So you hit this and then

21:02.929 --> 21:05.663
like the car [bleep]
m&ms out the back.

21:05.765 --> 21:07.765
-That's actually pretty cool.
-It's kind of dirty because

21:07.867 --> 21:09.467
it rained today,
but that's for you.

21:09.569 --> 21:11.335
This is a silver
bud light horse

21:11.437 --> 21:12.937
and then it
says some stuff on the top

21:13.039 --> 21:14.438
that I don't know
what it means.

21:14.540 --> 21:17.375
You know, I guess it's
the thought that counts.

21:17.477 --> 21:18.976
I'm exhausted.
I'm gonna have to probably

21:19.078 --> 21:21.112
take tomorrow off because

21:21.214 --> 21:23.581
because buying gifts for you
is really tough, so...

21:23.683 --> 21:25.983
Well, you bought me everything
that I really ever wanted.

21:26.085 --> 21:27.618
Yeah, and just remember,
this one's you.

21:27.720 --> 21:29.120
-[dave] and you are driving.
-No, I pass out

21:29.222 --> 21:30.755
-m&ms to people.
-Thank you, kevin.

21:30.857 --> 21:31.956
This means a lot to me.

21:32.058 --> 21:33.724
I worked really hard
on that today.

21:33.826 --> 21:35.359
<i> I know that dave</i>
<i> is gonna love</i>

21:35.461 --> 21:36.727
displaying these in
his new bar.

21:36.829 --> 21:37.995
-This is super cool.
-If I come over

21:38.097 --> 21:39.230
and they are not,
like, displayed...

21:39.332 --> 21:40.698
I'm gonna put them
on the mantle.

21:40.800 --> 21:42.466
Right on, right where
charity can appreciate them

21:42.568 --> 21:43.701
just as much as I can.

21:43.803 --> 21:44.869
I'll take that.
Please do.

21:44.971 --> 21:46.771
[laughter]

21:47.440 --> 21:48.639
okay.

21:48.741 --> 21:50.474
[dave] this really
[bleep] out m&ms,
though, huh?

21:54.881 --> 21:58.316
Well, looks like we've got
our work cut out for us today.

21:58.418 --> 21:59.984
Stack filled, blue skies.

22:00.086 --> 22:01.952
[dave]<i> day two is here</i>
<i> and it's turning out</i>

22:02.055 --> 22:03.621
to be a beautiful day.

22:03.723 --> 22:05.323
<i> Not a cloud in the sky.</i>

22:05.425 --> 22:07.058
<i> It is</i>
<i> completely perfect weather</i>

22:07.160 --> 22:09.527
<i> and a great day</i>
<i> for a car show.</i>

22:09.629 --> 22:11.329
<i> Kevin and I are now gonna</i>
<i> get a chance to walk around</i>

22:11.431 --> 22:13.764
and check out everything
we didn't see yesterday

22:13.866 --> 22:15.166
because it's beautiful.

22:15.835 --> 22:17.034
Ah, look at the colors.

22:17.136 --> 22:18.636
Really nice, dude.

22:18.738 --> 22:19.970
That's pretty.

22:20.973 --> 22:23.074
Explain to me what I'm seeing.

22:23.176 --> 22:25.476
I've seen this car before
and every time I see it

22:25.578 --> 22:27.845
I see something that's
just a little bit better

22:27.947 --> 22:29.413
and a little bit more awesome.

22:29.515 --> 22:32.650
So what you are seeing here is
a harlequin type
where the pearl...

22:32.752 --> 22:35.553
-A what?
-...Where it flops from
silver through a cast

22:35.655 --> 22:38.456
and it also goes
into a bronze.

22:38.558 --> 22:39.857
[kevin] is that
sort of bronze?

22:39.959 --> 22:41.792
It's also known
as "stardust,"
I think is what they call it.

22:41.894 --> 22:44.061
So bronze is what I'm seeing?
Yeah, like on the highlights?

22:44.163 --> 22:46.397
-No, it's actually
platinum. Yeah.
-Platinum.

22:46.499 --> 22:48.165
[dave] I think that's
the best way to show off

22:48.267 --> 22:50.835
the body lines on a round body
car like this. A fat fender.

22:50.937 --> 22:53.337
Where you get all of that roll
and you get the dark spots,

22:53.439 --> 22:55.239
the reflection, the highlight
and the low light.

22:55.341 --> 22:57.007
Just makes this car pop.
You don't need to put

22:57.110 --> 22:58.576
a bunch of bull
[bleep] flames

22:58.678 --> 23:01.078
and stuff all over it.
Just clean and classy.

23:01.180 --> 23:03.180
Let's slow down the flame
trash talking,

23:03.282 --> 23:04.648
all right, dave? Hoo!

23:04.751 --> 23:06.550
-Just like that.
-Dave, but tell everybody
that has flames it's okay.

23:06.652 --> 23:08.052
Well, the right car
can get flames.

23:08.154 --> 23:10.454
-This one right here is just
beautiful because...
-Classy.

23:10.556 --> 23:12.189
...It shows off gleam
across the headlights,

23:12.291 --> 23:13.758
the hood,
the side panels.

23:13.860 --> 23:15.059
It's like putting
a graphic on

23:15.161 --> 23:17.294
but it changes every time
the sunlight changes.

23:17.397 --> 23:18.963
[kevin] I really like
the artillery wheels, too.

23:19.065 --> 23:20.731
-[dave] mm-hmm.
-Just a classic looking car.

23:20.833 --> 23:21.932
Dakota digital gauges.

23:23.069 --> 23:25.202
[dave] yeah.
I like that.

23:25.304 --> 23:26.937
-[kevin] it's
a clean interior.
-Nice two-tone.

23:27.039 --> 23:29.673
[dave]<i> you know, getting away</i>
<i> from just a regular</i>
<i> '32 ford sedan,</i>

23:29.776 --> 23:31.008
<i> or roadster, whatever,</i>

23:31.110 --> 23:33.210
<i> it's really nice to see</i>
<i> something different.</i>

23:33.312 --> 23:35.279
<i> And these late '30s fords</i>
<i> really look nice.</i>

23:35.381 --> 23:37.615
<i> Especially when you use</i>
<i> this style of colors,</i>

23:37.717 --> 23:39.016
the stance is awesome,

23:39.118 --> 23:40.985
the wheels look right.
I like this car.

23:42.755 --> 23:43.788
It's good-looking.

23:43.890 --> 23:46.490
Let's go see what else
is over here.

23:46.592 --> 23:48.058
[kevin] we are supposed
to be judging this thing.

23:48.161 --> 23:50.127
I feel like I'm the only one
taking notes.

23:50.229 --> 23:52.029
Does anyone take their
job serious?

23:52.131 --> 23:53.497
-All right, buddy?
-Good, man.
Good to see you.

23:55.201 --> 23:56.434
This is super cool.

23:56.536 --> 23:59.370
You don't see these
401s very often.

23:59.472 --> 24:01.539
You can see the spread
on the exhaust

24:01.641 --> 24:04.008
versus like an ls
or a 350 or anything.

24:04.110 --> 24:05.576
There's this huge
gap in the middle.

24:05.678 --> 24:07.978
It's so cool to see these
vintage engines.

24:08.080 --> 24:09.213
I really like this car.

24:10.082 --> 24:11.582
It's really clean.

24:11.684 --> 24:14.118
This street rod
is really amazing.

24:14.220 --> 24:15.986
[kevin]<i> I'm looking at how</i>
<i> they tucked all these things</i>

24:16.088 --> 24:17.822
and just the vintage look.

24:17.924 --> 24:19.223
They nailed it on this one.

24:19.325 --> 24:20.691
Oh, I'm missing all my
canadian friends.

24:20.793 --> 24:21.826
They know how to drink beer.

24:21.928 --> 24:23.427
-Boy, do they?
<i> -</i> [kevin]<i> don't mind me.</i>

24:23.529 --> 24:25.329
<i> I'm just taking notes,</i>
<i> judging cars,</i>

24:25.431 --> 24:26.897
like we are supposed
to be doing.

24:26.999 --> 24:29.099
-Always great to see you.
Yeah, take care.
-All right. See you, dave.

24:29.202 --> 24:31.035
I got split up from my
judging partner.

24:31.137 --> 24:32.503
Now I got to go find him.

24:32.605 --> 24:34.939
This one's cool. Look at this.
It's got a 401 in it, dude.

24:35.041 --> 24:37.308
-401 tri-power.
-[dave] yeah [bleep].

24:37.410 --> 24:39.477
[kevin] look at the spread
on the exhaust.

24:39.579 --> 24:40.811
-Like... That's so cool.
-[dave] oh, yeah,
it's so cool.

24:40.913 --> 24:42.746
That's what they call
a wide block, right?

24:42.849 --> 24:44.548
-It's called a v8, dave.
-A wide block v8.

24:44.650 --> 24:46.817
-I don't know if they...
-We mock what we don't
understand, kev dog.

24:46.919 --> 24:48.152
I just thought it
was a 401 buick.

24:48.254 --> 24:51.388
Actually, they fooled you.
It's an ls hidden underneath

24:51.491 --> 24:52.857
what looks to be a wide block.

24:52.959 --> 24:54.625
-[kevin] no, I checked.
I checked.
-[laughing]

24:54.727 --> 24:56.193
you checked?

24:56.295 --> 24:58.362
-This is cool.
-[kevin] this is cool.

24:58.464 --> 24:59.663
[dave] look how far
they moved the seat back.

24:59.765 --> 25:01.198
There's still plenty of room
for the rear passenger

25:01.300 --> 25:02.466
if you care to put them
in there.

25:02.568 --> 25:05.669
[kevin] there's tons of room.
This car is cool.

25:05.771 --> 25:08.005
-Look at like the hood
structure and stuff, too.
-Look at that.

25:11.377 --> 25:12.376
This is definitely one.

25:12.478 --> 25:13.577
I had to write it down.

25:17.083 --> 25:18.616
[kevin] look
at the taillights.

25:18.718 --> 25:20.384
[dave]<i> you know, we've come</i>
<i> across a lot of great cars,</i>

25:20.486 --> 25:22.853
but right now I'm not sure
exactly what I'm looking at.

25:22.955 --> 25:24.088
I don't even know what
I'm looking at.

25:24.190 --> 25:25.289
I think it's an
imperial, isn't it?

25:25.391 --> 25:26.457
What do you mean?
Say that again.

25:26.559 --> 25:28.025
-I don't know
what I'm looking at.
-[gasps]

25:28.127 --> 25:30.427
dave is stumped and he's not
even trying to fake it.

25:30.530 --> 25:32.062
This may be a first.

25:32.164 --> 25:33.230
I'm stumped.

25:35.635 --> 25:37.468
It looks like a...
Is it...

25:40.473 --> 25:41.705
It's an edsel.

25:42.642 --> 25:44.408
How do you make an edsel
look this cool?

25:44.510 --> 25:45.676
Just like this.

25:50.149 --> 25:51.549
Oh, boy.

25:51.651 --> 25:53.017
Wow. That's cool.

25:54.153 --> 25:56.420
I'm not familiar
with this at all.

25:56.522 --> 25:57.621
[dave] yeah, this is rad.

25:57.723 --> 25:59.056
[kev] I like the way
that they did...

25:59.158 --> 26:00.624
-That's like,
what do you call that?
-Oh, yeah.

26:00.726 --> 26:02.359
-[dave] speedboat.
-Yeah.

26:02.461 --> 26:03.761
Speedboat the glass.

26:03.863 --> 26:05.596
Got rid of the vent glass.
Got rid of the top.

26:05.698 --> 26:07.531
Really nice work on that
stainless around there.

26:07.633 --> 26:09.033
Clean, simple across the dash.

26:09.135 --> 26:11.035
Not a bunch
of baloney all over.

26:11.137 --> 26:12.469
[kevin] yeah,
that's cool, dude.

26:12.572 --> 26:14.104
Is this yours? I just
wanna see a bit
more information

26:14.206 --> 26:15.639
like on the chassis and stuff.

26:16.642 --> 26:18.309
[dave]<i> this car has had</i>
<i> so many modifications,</i>

26:18.411 --> 26:19.743
this might be
a fiction.

26:19.845 --> 26:21.011
Okay, are you ready?

26:21.113 --> 26:23.914
Once upon a time there was
an edsel ranger two-door.

26:24.016 --> 26:25.149
-Sedan.
-So... That is...

26:25.251 --> 26:27.618
And a really nice
young man bought it

26:27.720 --> 26:31.088
and decided, well, "what would
make this so much better?

26:31.190 --> 26:32.523
Let's cut the top off."

26:32.625 --> 26:33.791
so he did.

26:33.893 --> 26:36.460
And 15 degrees lay back
on the windshield

26:36.562 --> 26:38.762
and the dash
before and after...

26:38.864 --> 26:42.032
Now dave's reading me
some fairytale about an edsel.

26:42.134 --> 26:43.701
I'm not even
a big fan of edsels.

26:43.803 --> 26:45.035
I mean,
this car is kind of cool,

26:45.137 --> 26:47.204
-but we've got stuff to do.
-[dave] look at that.

26:47.306 --> 26:48.606
Come here.
It's a night-time story.

26:48.708 --> 26:49.974
Not gonna come back
if you continue to tell

26:50.076 --> 26:51.141
-stories like that.
-Come here.

26:51.243 --> 26:52.242
-Okay.
-Yeah.

26:52.345 --> 26:54.812
Then the package train
moved forward 12 inches.

26:54.914 --> 26:56.313
Nope. I'm done.

26:56.849 --> 26:58.148
Big baby.

26:58.250 --> 27:00.284
I'm gonna go read it
in my room, then.

27:03.022 --> 27:04.555
-[dave laughing]
-I don't know what's
got into dave,

27:04.657 --> 27:05.923
but I don't want
any part of this.

27:06.025 --> 27:07.358
That is the stock
configuration

27:07.460 --> 27:08.459
-of the taillights.
-[man] correct.

27:08.561 --> 27:09.927
-[dave] holy [bleep]
-[man] that is cool.

27:10.029 --> 27:12.329
[kevin] that is super cool.
Yeah.

27:12.431 --> 27:14.698
[dave] all the metal and paint
and assembly was done by

27:14.800 --> 27:17.534
mike walter at rainier
rod and custom

27:17.637 --> 27:19.937
in graham, washington.
The end.

27:20.373 --> 27:21.538
[dave laughs]

27:21.641 --> 27:24.441
-send help.
-Does the hood open?

27:24.543 --> 27:26.877
-I was waiting for reindeer
and little rabbits...
-Nice.

27:26.979 --> 27:27.911
...And squirrels to run.

27:28.014 --> 27:29.513
"hi, dave and kevin."

27:31.617 --> 27:33.717
-what? I'm having
a disney moment here.
-What, what's into you today?

27:33.819 --> 27:35.786
[dave] you can either
jump in or jump out.

27:35.888 --> 27:38.055
[kevin] obviously.
It's like rainbows
and unicorns today.

27:39.492 --> 27:41.291
[dave]<i> edsel never made</i>
<i> anything quite as cool</i>

27:41.394 --> 27:43.427
<i> as what this car</i>
<i> really turned out to be.</i>

27:43.529 --> 27:46.030
<i> And by taking the top</i>
<i> off of it and doing</i>
<i> the modifications</i>

27:46.132 --> 27:48.499
they've done, they've really
captured a great looking

27:48.601 --> 27:51.702
silhouette to this car.
I really do like this vehicle.

27:51.804 --> 27:53.604
This is wonderful.
A really neat car.

27:53.706 --> 27:55.973
I like this. It's cool
because it's different.

27:56.075 --> 27:57.841
[kevin] no, what I'm saying,
I didn't even know
what it was.

27:57.943 --> 27:59.576
[dave] it is super cool.

27:59.679 --> 28:00.778
[kevin] I agree.

28:00.880 --> 28:02.146
[dave] all right,
let's go check out more.

28:02.248 --> 28:03.514
-Great job.
-Thank you.

28:03.616 --> 28:04.715
Well, thank you.

28:04.817 --> 28:05.916
Dude, this is nice.

28:06.018 --> 28:06.917
This is a really nice car.

28:11.390 --> 28:13.424
[dave] it's got a coyote
in it. That's sweet.

28:16.629 --> 28:18.362
[kevin] I don't think
that's a coyote, though.

28:21.267 --> 28:23.133
I think that's a chevy
engine.

28:23.235 --> 28:24.234
You are right.

28:24.336 --> 28:25.602
It's an ls, isn't it?

28:26.505 --> 28:27.604
Yeah.

28:27.707 --> 28:30.007
<i> The guy with this</i>
<i> ford woody has it right.</i>

28:30.109 --> 28:31.642
It is a ford.

28:31.744 --> 28:33.210
Try to stay true.

28:33.312 --> 28:37.114
But he put a chevy engine
with ford covers. Awesome!

28:37.216 --> 28:38.482
-Ls.
-It says five-oh on the top.

28:38.584 --> 28:40.484
Ls with the coyote
covers on it.

28:40.586 --> 28:42.453
-That's funny.
-Yeah, that's trick.

28:43.389 --> 28:45.456
[dave] yeah, look
how nice the inside is.

28:45.558 --> 28:47.391
-These are cool cars.
-Mm-hmm.

28:47.493 --> 28:49.026
[dave]<i> what I look for when</i>
<i> I look at these cars</i>

28:49.128 --> 28:50.227
<i> for builder's choices,</i>

28:50.329 --> 28:53.297
I just look for fit
and finish, cleanliness.

28:53.399 --> 28:54.465
I look for detail.

28:54.567 --> 28:56.500
And I also look
for maybe a theme

28:56.602 --> 28:57.868
carried through
the whole thing.

28:57.970 --> 28:59.369
Gotta be careful
when you wash them, though.

28:59.472 --> 29:01.105
-You get splinters.
-Is that true?

29:01.207 --> 29:02.673
-No, no.
-Have you ever washed a woody?

29:02.775 --> 29:03.707
I've never washed the car.

29:05.377 --> 29:06.310
Let's keep going.

29:07.913 --> 29:09.613
-These patina trucks
all bagged out, badass.
-So cool.

29:09.715 --> 29:10.781
-What's up, man?
-[kevin] what's up?

29:10.883 --> 29:12.082
-How's it going, guys?
-What's all that?

29:12.184 --> 29:13.851
Whoa, what in the hell
is that?

29:13.953 --> 29:15.419
Is that a hydraulic?

29:15.521 --> 29:17.387
No, it's a... Tesla?

29:17.490 --> 29:18.956
Yeah, tesla model s, actually.

29:19.058 --> 29:20.023
Oh, wow.

29:24.330 --> 29:25.829
-[kevin] wow.
-[dave] that is so cool.

29:25.931 --> 29:27.531
So where's the,
where are the batteries?

29:27.633 --> 29:31.301
Well, so I got, I got nine
batteries through the chassis.

29:31.403 --> 29:33.370
-[kevin] oh, okay.
-Yep, it's just underneath
the cab.

29:33.472 --> 29:34.705
-Okay.
-We ran up some firewall.

29:34.807 --> 29:36.406
[kevin] because there is
no drive light.

29:36.509 --> 29:38.275
-Exactly.
-[kevin] this truck
is awesome.

29:38.377 --> 29:39.676
I can't imagine how fast

29:39.779 --> 29:41.545
this thing is, though.
And how quiet.

29:41.647 --> 29:43.313
So I'm running about
400 volts in this.

29:43.415 --> 29:45.048
-Okay. And horsepower?
-Yeah, so...

29:45.151 --> 29:47.918
Uh, horsepower, this thing
will put out about 400,

29:48.020 --> 29:49.753
-450 horsepower.
-But the torque.

29:49.855 --> 29:52.222
No, the torque's,
it's through the roof.

29:52.324 --> 29:53.323
It is off the charts.

29:53.425 --> 29:54.525
-Yeah,
it's not like...
-As I understand,

29:54.627 --> 29:56.627
it's like, probably 800
at 450, isn't it?

29:56.729 --> 29:58.896
-It's pretty close.
-[kevin] yeah. Instant.

29:58.998 --> 30:00.364
-[man] instant, that's right.
-[kevin] instant.

30:00.466 --> 30:01.865
Are you running
this on the autocross?

30:01.967 --> 30:03.467
You know, I thought about it.

30:03.569 --> 30:05.068
I haven't really had it
out there yet.

30:05.171 --> 30:07.004
I mean, I don't know.

30:07.106 --> 30:08.205
You guys want to try it out?

30:08.307 --> 30:09.273
Are you...
Are you serious?

30:09.375 --> 30:10.340
You'd let me ride?

30:10.442 --> 30:11.909
-Sure.
-[kevin] are you sure?

30:12.011 --> 30:13.710
-Hold on.
-Oh, wait. Hold on a minute.

30:13.813 --> 30:15.112
My bad. I'm supposed
to be on your team.

30:15.214 --> 30:17.748
-He's a really good driver.
-[man] tell you what.

30:17.850 --> 30:19.850
I tell you what.
I think you've got

30:19.952 --> 30:21.552
-a reputation
for driving cars.
-[dave] yeah!

30:21.654 --> 30:23.120
I can probably trust him.

30:23.222 --> 30:24.588
It's... Not a good reputation.

30:24.690 --> 30:26.757
-It's not a good reputation?
-But it's a reputation,
so he's right.

30:26.859 --> 30:28.826
-No fair. No fair.
-[man] reputation's
reputation.

30:28.928 --> 30:31.028
Yeah, no, seriously, if you
guys want to try this out.

30:31.130 --> 30:32.830
-Yeah, yeah, go ahead.
-[dave] dude, I would...

30:32.932 --> 30:34.431
-[dave] that would be
so, so cool.
-That's cool.

30:34.533 --> 30:35.833
Kevin is trying to mess
me up a little bit.

30:35.935 --> 30:37.467
But you know what,
let's do this.

30:37.570 --> 30:39.002
-I'm ready.
-Sounds good to me.

30:39.104 --> 30:40.370
-[kevin] awesome.
-I'll be here, man.

30:40.472 --> 30:42.239
-Grab me when you're ready.
-And I'm so glad
this is patina.

30:42.341 --> 30:43.674
Remember the last time
you ran the course?

30:43.776 --> 30:45.542
-You took out all the cones.
Let's go.
-[man laughs]

31:00.226 --> 31:01.992
[dave]<i> we've been checking out</i>
<i> all the great cars</i>

31:02.094 --> 31:03.827
here at the goodguys
show in salt lake city.

31:03.929 --> 31:05.362
And now it's time to have
some fun

31:05.464 --> 31:06.730
with a very unique
vehicle.

31:06.832 --> 31:09.299
So, manual breaks,
manual steering.

31:09.401 --> 31:11.001
800 foot-pounds
of torque.

31:11.103 --> 31:12.636
Be careful out there, dave.

31:12.738 --> 31:14.404
I'm super worried about you.

31:14.506 --> 31:15.839
Yeah, listen, dave.

31:15.941 --> 31:18.242
-Yep.
-I think you're gonna
have your hands full.

31:18.344 --> 31:20.043
-[man laughing]
-I, I think you are right.

31:20.145 --> 31:21.845
Okay, so buckle up.

31:21.947 --> 31:23.947
Oh, there is a, oh,
there is a seatbelt.

31:24.049 --> 31:25.382
-[man] yeah, yeah, there are.
We're good.
-There is a seatbelt!

31:25.484 --> 31:27.551
[dave]<i> what a great time</i>
<i> to find out this car</i>
<i> has no breaks</i>

31:27.653 --> 31:30.220
and no steering
just before I hit the gas.

31:30.322 --> 31:31.722
All right, here we go.

31:32.524 --> 31:34.925
[whooping]

31:38.464 --> 31:39.763
[dave] blah, blah, blah.
That's enough talk.

31:39.865 --> 31:41.365
Let's get to driving.

31:42.301 --> 31:43.400
[tires screeching]

31:55.614 --> 31:59.149
[kevin]<i> considering that</i>
<i> the truck had manual breaks,</i>

31:59.251 --> 32:01.551
no power steering,
I think he's doing okay.

32:03.889 --> 32:05.422
Okay, scratch that.

32:05.524 --> 32:06.890
He's not doing
so good anymore.

32:09.461 --> 32:10.627
[kevin laughs]

32:12.431 --> 32:14.364

oh, oh!

32:31.583 --> 32:32.649
Oh... [bleep]

32:33.452 --> 32:34.184
nice.

32:34.286 --> 32:35.385
[bleep] dave.

32:35.988 --> 32:37.387
Holy cow.

32:37.489 --> 32:39.222
[laughter]

32:39.325 --> 32:41.692
[dave]<i> I really don't want</i>
<i> to wreck somebody else's car</i>

32:41.794 --> 32:43.093
<i> and have to buy it.</i>

32:43.996 --> 32:45.696
And I missed the wall.
Thank god.

32:46.332 --> 32:47.531
Whoo!

32:47.633 --> 32:49.566
Now, in my eyes,
you're a racecar driver.

32:49.668 --> 32:53.437
When you get that loose
and you get it back
under control,

32:53.539 --> 32:56.006
I hate to say this, dave, but
you are now a racecar driver.

32:56.108 --> 32:58.375
This thing is stupid fast.

32:58.477 --> 32:59.776
-I saw it.
-Like, look at that.

32:59.878 --> 33:01.511
That doesn't happen
very often.

33:01.613 --> 33:03.880
Yeah. And you
almost wrecked, too.

33:03.983 --> 33:06.316
Yeah, that's probably the part
where I'm shaking right now.

33:06.785 --> 33:08.118
[kevin] so...

33:08.220 --> 33:10.821
[dave]<i> there's nothing</i>
<i> like meeting a perfectly</i>
<i> good stranger</i>

33:10.923 --> 33:13.123
with a really cool vehicle,
borrowing it,

33:13.225 --> 33:16.026
going on the racetrack
and almost totaling it.

33:16.128 --> 33:17.294
How many cones did I get?

33:17.396 --> 33:18.695
Three.

33:19.898 --> 33:20.731
[dave] yeah.

33:20.833 --> 33:22.866
[man] I've been there,
done that.

33:22.968 --> 33:24.801
Well, I didn't burn
a cone to the exhaust,

33:24.903 --> 33:26.503
because there is no exhaust.

33:27.806 --> 33:29.106
I'm excited.

33:29.208 --> 33:30.741
Okay, it feels a
little loose, dude.

33:30.843 --> 33:31.975
I'm, we've got to see.

33:32.945 --> 33:35.278
I'm gonna take it
a little bit easier.

33:35.381 --> 33:37.347
I'm a little
intimidated by this thing.

33:46.892 --> 33:49.226
[tires screeching]

33:52.031 --> 33:54.331
[kevin]<i> on one hand, it was</i>
<i> super smooth and super-fast.</i>

33:54.433 --> 33:56.299
<i>Just like a modern sports car.</i>

33:56.402 --> 33:57.534
<i> And on the other hand,</i>

33:57.636 --> 33:59.870
the brakes were horrible
and it barely steered.

33:59.972 --> 34:01.605
[bleep] going backward.

34:03.442 --> 34:04.808
I went the wrong way.

34:07.179 --> 34:09.046
His making his own trail.

34:10.983 --> 34:12.082
[kevin]<i> gosh,</i>
<i> I just never thought</i>

34:12.184 --> 34:14.117
about building
an electric car.

34:14.219 --> 34:17.754
But after this experience,
I would definitely
consider it.

34:19.792 --> 34:20.857
I'll tell you what.

34:20.959 --> 34:22.626
Look, he's going to drift
around that corner.

34:37.209 --> 34:39.009
[cheering]

34:39.111 --> 34:40.077
all right.

34:40.179 --> 34:41.878
I went
completely off the course.

34:42.815 --> 34:44.247
Dude, are you sold on this?

34:44.349 --> 34:46.850
-Hey, let's build these.
-Forget waiting to build one.

34:46.952 --> 34:48.952
I got a much better idea.

34:49.054 --> 34:50.654
Let's just get this one
and get the hell out of here.

34:50.756 --> 34:52.222
I could just...
Let me get in for a sec.

35:01.800 --> 35:03.366
-Let's go.
-Don't hit that, though.

35:03.469 --> 35:04.901
Don't hit,
don't hit the p.

35:07.873 --> 35:09.406
The owner of the
truck actually said

35:09.508 --> 35:10.507
drive it like you stole it.

35:10.609 --> 35:12.109
-And actually...
-Hey, hey, guys. Guys!

35:12.211 --> 35:13.743
-Hey, wait!
-Go, go, go, go, go, go!

35:15.447 --> 35:17.047
Dude. Hey!

35:17.549 --> 35:19.049
Kev!

35:19.151 --> 35:20.417
I thought we were friends.

35:26.592 --> 35:27.691
[dave]<i> we're here</i>
<i> in salt lake city, utah</i>

35:27.793 --> 35:29.459
at the goodguys
show at the fairgrounds.

35:29.561 --> 35:31.328
Sometimes you need
to take a break from all

35:31.430 --> 35:33.230
the responsibilities
you have in your life.

35:33.332 --> 35:35.732
And that time, well,
it's right now.

35:35.834 --> 35:37.501
[both laughing]

35:39.872 --> 35:40.837
it's done.

35:43.375 --> 35:45.976
-Hey. We weren't really
gonna steal it.
-Dude.

35:46.078 --> 35:47.844
No, we were,
but you've seeing us
and I just felt bad.

35:47.946 --> 35:49.412
That thing is awesome, dude.

35:49.515 --> 35:51.081
-Hey, thanks.
-Very, very cool.

35:51.183 --> 35:52.282
That is super awesome.

35:52.384 --> 35:53.650
You got it figured out,
for sure.

35:53.752 --> 35:55.051
Yeah, that thing rocked, dude.

35:55.154 --> 35:57.554
Some, some wide tires
and some power steering

35:57.656 --> 35:59.256
and you'd
probably beat them all, dude.

35:59.358 --> 36:01.324
-Yeah. I love how
you let me ride your truck...
-Maybe next time.

36:01.426 --> 36:02.626
And then you go,

36:02.728 --> 36:04.895
"oh, by the way, it has no
power steering, no brakes.

36:04.997 --> 36:06.897
-And goodbye."
-[kevin laughing]

36:06.999 --> 36:08.431
-hey, thanks again, man.
-Thanks, buddy.

36:08.534 --> 36:10.567
-Thank you.
-[man] great to see you.
Have fun today, you guys.

36:10.669 --> 36:12.202
-[dave] thanks, see you.
-[man] see you guys.

36:12.304 --> 36:16.273
Officially the results are,
dave kindig, 71.542.

36:16.375 --> 36:19.242
Kev dog, 87.201.

36:19.344 --> 36:21.912
Kev dog however did kill
a lot more cones than dave,

36:22.014 --> 36:23.780
so I guess we're
gonna call it a tie.

36:23.882 --> 36:24.581
Good job, you guys.

36:28.487 --> 36:30.453
[dave]<i> from the autocross,</i>
<i> to the swap meet,</i>

36:30.556 --> 36:31.588
<i> to the burnout contest,</i>

36:31.690 --> 36:33.456
this show has something
for everybody.

36:33.559 --> 36:35.659
Not to mention, a lot
of great looking rides.

36:38.363 --> 36:40.730
See the tuck and roll
in that interior?

36:40.832 --> 36:42.265
It's on the center
of the console.

36:42.367 --> 36:43.533
[kevin] oh, that's cool.

36:43.635 --> 36:44.834
The hump pattern.

36:44.937 --> 36:46.436
That's really cool.

36:46.538 --> 36:48.438
[dave] oh, look,
the fabric on the...

36:48.540 --> 36:50.073
I like that. It's clean.

36:50.175 --> 36:51.174
Name the wood.

36:55.514 --> 36:57.214
[kevin]<i> I am definitely</i>
<i> a tree expert.</i>

36:57.316 --> 36:59.015
Some people call me
a tree hugger.

36:59.117 --> 37:00.183
Birdseye maple.

37:02.287 --> 37:04.154
Hold on. Birchwood.

37:05.657 --> 37:06.656
No.

37:06.758 --> 37:08.425
You were right the
first time, though.

37:08.527 --> 37:09.993
Thanks for making him
feel stupid, though.

37:10.095 --> 37:11.428
-That was awesome.
-Was that really--

37:11.530 --> 37:14.431
I said it was-- I said it was
wormy, and I got corrected.

37:14.533 --> 37:16.666
-It's birdseye.
It's curly.
-Curly.

37:16.768 --> 37:17.801
It's not birdseye.

37:17.903 --> 37:19.302
Where is that guy who
made me look stupid?

37:19.404 --> 37:21.638
-Where did he go?
-I'm right here.

37:21.740 --> 37:22.806
[dave]<i> don't even</i>
<i> come close</i>

37:22.908 --> 37:25.175
to trying to test
my tree knowledge.

37:25.277 --> 37:27.244
I am one with
arbor, sprout.

37:28.313 --> 37:30.780
No. Wormy has the black
winds and the grooves

37:30.882 --> 37:33.817
and the wood missing.
Almost like scarred.

37:33.919 --> 37:35.085
[kevin] right.

37:35.187 --> 37:36.820
[dave] because the worms eat
their way through the tree.

37:36.922 --> 37:39.789
[kevin]<i> who doesn't know about</i>
<i> wormy maples and pine trees</i>

37:39.891 --> 37:41.825
and walnut aspens?

37:41.927 --> 37:43.793
I can tell you this,
though, that this wood

37:43.895 --> 37:46.263
came from a tree
in colorado.

37:46.365 --> 37:47.497
You want to know
how I know that?

37:47.599 --> 37:48.898
-How's that?
-Because of the smell.

37:49.001 --> 37:49.966
Yep.

37:52.237 --> 37:53.670
-I was kidding, dave.
I was...
-[laughter]

37:53.772 --> 37:55.105
come on.

37:55.207 --> 37:57.540
[kevin]<i> so,</i>
<i> at kindig-it design,</i>
<i> we really pride ourselves</i>

37:57.643 --> 37:58.842
<i> on how we finish</i>
<i> out our beds.</i>

37:59.444 --> 38:00.944
This one is amazing.

38:01.046 --> 38:02.612
Everything fits perfect.

38:02.714 --> 38:03.913
<i> The case in the front.</i>

38:04.016 --> 38:05.215
<i> The color of the wood.</i>

38:05.317 --> 38:06.283
The slats.

38:07.352 --> 38:08.585
A-plus.

38:08.687 --> 38:10.620
-It's beautiful, dude.
Looks so rich, dude.
-Looks sweet!

38:13.492 --> 38:15.191
Great colors. Oh, my god.
Out in the sun,

38:15.294 --> 38:17.761
-this wood looks like
it's already on fire.
-Yeah!

38:17.863 --> 38:20.897
[kevin]<i> every time I look at</i>
<i>a woody they always look rich.</i>

38:20.999 --> 38:22.565
And if you get
the wrong colors,

38:22.668 --> 38:24.267
I think it can
take away from that.

38:26.071 --> 38:27.103
And what year? This is a '36?

38:27.205 --> 38:28.305
-36.
-Okay.

38:28.407 --> 38:29.973
I think think you're supposed
to say fire

38:30.075 --> 38:31.474
around woodys,
dude.

38:31.576 --> 38:33.243
Hey, I was just kidding, man.

38:33.345 --> 38:35.011
I don't even have
a lighter or nothing, man.

38:35.113 --> 38:36.713
No. No. It's just...

38:36.815 --> 38:39.482
-But it looks like so warm
with that color of wood.
-[man] yeah, it's super rich.

38:39.584 --> 38:40.917
It's just beautiful.

38:41.019 --> 38:42.986
And that's-- I don't think
there's a better combination,

38:43.088 --> 38:46.756
black top with that red
and the real rich wood
like that.

38:46.858 --> 38:49.259
The interior color
is just fantastic.

38:49.361 --> 38:51.795
Yeah, I love the...
The colors on this car

38:51.897 --> 38:53.596
are just perfect.

38:53.699 --> 38:55.665
[kevin]<i> the, the color</i>
<i> of the wood and the color</i>
<i> of the paint</i>

38:55.767 --> 38:59.336
<i> on this woody is on fire.</i>
<i> This thing looks amazing.</i>

39:01.840 --> 39:04.007
Very, very nice.

39:04.109 --> 39:07.210
Now that kevin and I have
looked at almost every single
car here,

39:07.312 --> 39:08.511
we got to go back
to the truck

39:08.613 --> 39:10.980
and figure out what our
top ten is gonna look like.

39:11.083 --> 39:12.182
This is how
we're gonna do this.

39:12.284 --> 39:14.617
One star for it's
an awesome car,

39:14.720 --> 39:16.453
-but we only have ten spots.
-[dave] right.

39:16.555 --> 39:19.789
The star system is basically
you judge cars,

39:19.891 --> 39:22.459
and you give them stars
and that shows how much
you like them.

39:22.561 --> 39:23.526
<i> It's very innovative.</i>

39:23.628 --> 39:25.528
And then three stars means

39:25.630 --> 39:26.796
they are probably
going to get an award.

39:26.898 --> 39:28.331
Two stars is good.

39:28.433 --> 39:29.699
Three stars is better.

39:29.801 --> 39:32.202
And you know it can just
go as many stars as you want.

39:32.304 --> 39:33.937
<i> It's unlimited, okay?</i>

39:34.039 --> 39:36.473
Nobody has a judging
system that is unlimited.

39:36.575 --> 39:37.774
This is amazing.

39:37.876 --> 39:39.476
This is groundbreaking.

39:39.578 --> 39:41.878
So, no, three stars
should be definitely.

39:41.980 --> 39:44.714
Two stars should be a maybe,
put it in, put it out.

39:44.816 --> 39:48.284
[kevin]<i> I put a lot of work</i>
<i> into this judging star system</i>

39:48.387 --> 39:50.120
and now dave is just
throwing it out the window.

39:50.222 --> 39:52.255
This is very frustrating.

39:52.357 --> 39:53.790
Okay, I wasn't
ready for the two star deal,

39:53.892 --> 39:55.091
but that's fine.

39:57.295 --> 39:59.195
-[dave] uh...
-I would say that's a one.

39:59.297 --> 40:00.430
-It's clean.
-Okay?

40:00.532 --> 40:02.265
Four door, definitely.
Three stars.

40:02.367 --> 40:03.833
Oh, yeah, that was a good one.

40:03.935 --> 40:04.934
Yeah. Your stars
are really nice.

40:05.036 --> 40:06.069
Oh, thanks.

40:06.171 --> 40:07.971
'39 ford.

40:08.073 --> 40:10.140
-Oh, no, the sedan.
-Yeah.

40:10.242 --> 40:13.109
No, that was the two-door.
This is the sedan.

40:13.211 --> 40:14.511
Oh, you're right. Okay.

40:14.613 --> 40:15.979
Let's do...

40:17.082 --> 40:19.682
Uh... Truck.

40:19.785 --> 40:21.050
Really nice car.

40:21.153 --> 40:22.919
There's the vw.
The '60.

40:23.021 --> 40:24.154
The one that you guessed.

40:24.256 --> 40:26.089
Mm-hmm. It's a nice car.

40:26.191 --> 40:28.691
Uh, '32 dodge was
the one with the spoons.

40:28.794 --> 40:30.827
Pretty cool. Pretty cool.

40:30.929 --> 40:32.495
-Um...
-Okay.

40:32.597 --> 40:33.396
El camino.

40:34.232 --> 40:35.932
That's pretty awesome.

40:36.034 --> 40:37.567
The black one that
you really liked.

40:37.669 --> 40:40.170
Oh, yeah, that.
Three. All day.

40:40.272 --> 40:41.504
-[kevin] you want
to put that one in?
-Yeah.

40:41.606 --> 40:43.039
We've made our decisions.

40:54.719 --> 40:59.456
<i> We want to give a big</i>
<i>shout-out to kindig-it design.</i>

40:59.558 --> 41:00.957
<i> Big round of applause</i>
<i> for them.</i>

41:01.059 --> 41:03.293
<i> -They did our</i>
<i> builder's choice top 10.</i>
-[crowd cheering]

41:03.395 --> 41:05.295
<i> they'll be handing</i>
<i> them out shortly.</i>

41:05.397 --> 41:07.831
<i> And so we are very grateful</i>
<i> to have them support</i>
<i> the event.</i>

41:07.933 --> 41:09.165
<i> Helping us out.</i>

41:09.267 --> 41:13.036
<i> Making the salt lake</i>
<i> nationals a huge success.</i>

41:13.138 --> 41:15.205
[dave]<i> we had so much fun</i>
<i> getting the chance to walk</i>

41:15.307 --> 41:17.507
around the entire show,
both inside and out.

41:17.609 --> 41:20.844
Experiencing the autocross.
And of course,
picking our top ten.

41:20.946 --> 41:23.446
<i> All right. Are you guys ready</i>
<i> to see some award winners?</i>

41:23.548 --> 41:26.115
I had a wonderful time.
I know kevin did, too.

41:26.218 --> 41:28.451
And now it's time to give
the awards away.

41:28.553 --> 41:29.919
Out of monument, colorado,

41:30.021 --> 41:34.491
