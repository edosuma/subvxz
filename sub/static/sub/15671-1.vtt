02:13.393 --> 02:15.348
Isn't he pretty?

02:34.059 --> 02:37.342
Can you... can you
speak English?

02:37.476 --> 02:39.799
- Yes.
- What...?

02:41.184 --> 02:43.933
- What day is it?
- "Yes, I like to move it, move it."

02:44.059 --> 02:49.428
This is best day of my life!

02:49.559 --> 02:52.723
- No, I'm asking...
- Ah, what the day?

02:52.851 --> 02:55.174
- Yeah.
- Er, it's, er...

02:56.268 --> 02:57.725
Wait a minute.

03:01.184 --> 03:04.052
Stupid question. What day is it?

03:04.184 --> 03:07.632
- Oh, sorry.
- OK.

03:09.393 --> 03:11.467
It's 24 July.

03:13.351 --> 03:16.053
And what a day it is.

03:16.184 --> 03:19.266
It's the best day ever.

03:24.309 --> 03:28.848
You might be wondering
why I'm up at this ungodly hour.

03:28.976 --> 03:34.676
Like others, I believe that the time
between 3:00am and 4:00am

03:34.809 --> 03:41.340
is one where the veil between
this world and the next is the thinnest.

03:41.476 --> 03:43.881
Often during this time of the day,

03:44.018 --> 03:49.054
I hear the sound of my name
uttered by an unseen presence.

04:23.893 --> 04:25.469
Good morning.

05:08.601 --> 05:11.172
Wow!

05:15.559 --> 05:18.972
And here we go
into the garage.

05:19.101 --> 05:23.675
That's right.
We're going to ride the elevator.

05:23.809 --> 05:26.132
All right. Let's ride it.

05:27.809 --> 05:29.516
Here it is.

05:33.851 --> 05:37.299
This is the elevator at the market
parking garage in Round Oak, Virginia.

05:37.434 --> 05:41.298
This elevator has been made
famous right here. Here we go.

06:10.309 --> 06:12.845
Here we are at 6
which is burned out.

06:14.143 --> 06:16.512
Just your basic Dover elevator.

06:16.643 --> 06:20.423
For all of those of you at Dover Elevators,
it's a good brand of elevator.

06:20.559 --> 06:22.218
Now we're gonna go back down to 1.

06:22.351 --> 06:25.432
All right. Now it's time
to go off to work.

06:27.976 --> 06:29.883
Wasn't that fun?

07:03.684 --> 07:08.591
You know how much strength
it takes to rebel? Huh?

07:08.726 --> 07:13.467
So, this is a night in the life
of S Grey, man.

07:13.601 --> 07:16.765
You know what I'm saying?
Sleeping on the couch.

07:17.934 --> 07:21.347
With no bag.
Grinding my ass off every day.

07:22.851 --> 07:26.347
'Shorties' not enjoying their mother.

07:26.476 --> 07:30.422
Man not enjoying his wife
or his woman, his lady.

07:32.226 --> 07:34.430
Just bullshit, man.

07:35.184 --> 07:36.760
Alpha male...

07:37.893 --> 07:42.799
...trapped in and locked in
through religion and politics.

07:44.184 --> 07:51.259
Soon enough, man, my plans
will all come into perfection.

09:29.309 --> 09:32.011
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

13:13.434 --> 13:19.218
Today we're gonna videotape
Sasha doing his first ever shave.

13:19.351 --> 13:22.349
- Oh, boy.
- All right, Sasha's how old now?

13:23.643 --> 13:25.799
Er... 15.

13:25.934 --> 13:27.475
Oh, good, good.

13:27.601 --> 13:31.298
First thing Sasha's gonna do
is get the water hot

13:31.434 --> 13:34.930
for the, er, hot cloth that
you're gonna put on your face.

13:36.309 --> 13:41.511
Yes. So it'll warm up your face
and moisturize your skin.

13:41.643 --> 13:44.890
Does he have like
a nice warm face now?

13:45.018 --> 13:49.177
- It's always been hot!
- Whatever you say there, dude.

13:50.851 --> 13:55.259
I think we should probably do
a close-up of those whiskers.

13:55.393 --> 13:57.798
They're really long now.

14:00.018 --> 14:01.475
Thank you.

14:03.434 --> 14:06.717
You need to, like, really lather it up.

14:08.143 --> 14:11.306
OK, I don't think you need
to put it on your nose!

14:11.434 --> 14:12.761
Yeah...

14:12.893 --> 14:17.135
A five-blade razor
which we got as a sample.

14:17.268 --> 14:19.970
- Is it time?
- Go ahead.

14:25.976 --> 14:29.804
OK, you're shaving for me.
This is embarrassing.

14:34.143 --> 14:37.473
- I'm bleeding.
- Yes. Don't worry.

14:38.268 --> 14:40.472
- You will survive it.
- Wow!

14:40.601 --> 14:42.757
Don't worry, you'll be all right.

14:47.018 --> 14:48.807
This is torture.

14:50.351 --> 14:52.674
Does it hurt?

14:52.809 --> 14:55.179
- Yes.
- It'll sting for a little while.

14:55.309 --> 15:00.511
All right, dry yourself off and let's
take a look at the nice, clean shave.

15:00.643 --> 15:03.806
Good job, buddy.
Here's what we do.

15:03.934 --> 15:06.719
Hey, don't...
Face the camera here.

15:06.851 --> 15:08.758
Put a little piece on there.

15:08.893 --> 15:11.464
See, and it sticks to the bloody part.

15:12.726 --> 15:15.049
And voile? He's done.

15:16.393 --> 15:19.723
Hey, wait.
High five, buddy. You survived it.

17:17.809 --> 17:19.883
We're documenting everything.

17:24.726 --> 17:26.681
Bobby, let mommy sleep.

17:30.518 --> 17:32.343
Are you feeling OK?

17:32.476 --> 17:34.762
Oh, I just feel terrible, you know.

17:34.893 --> 17:38.056
You feel weird?
OK, this is how you'll be weirder.

17:40.101 --> 17:43.099
- OK, let's let mommy sleep.
- OK!

17:44.059 --> 17:46.512
Bobby, get down.

17:46.643 --> 17:49.843
- We're gonna let mommy sleep.
- Son of a cuz...

17:49.976 --> 17:52.299
Oh, thank you, thank you.

17:52.434 --> 17:55.183
Erm, I do have a question though,
cos I...

17:55.309 --> 17:59.433
My biggest worry is, of course,
my bandages and stuff,

17:59.559 --> 18:03.139
but I know I can take a shower,
but I haven't.

18:03.268 --> 18:06.349
I thought maybe I could at least try
take a shower before you got here.

18:06.476 --> 18:10.007
Is that OK if I just go ahead
and do that? Oh, good.

18:10.143 --> 18:13.508
- Dad, can I come down?
- Bobby, can we have a talk though?

18:13.643 --> 18:15.349
Please, please.

18:15.476 --> 18:18.178
I just need to have a talk, OK?

18:18.309 --> 18:20.845
Because grandma is telling me,

18:20.976 --> 18:25.100
with all the pressures,
what a great boy you are,

18:25.226 --> 18:27.679
and of course I know that.

18:27.809 --> 18:30.558
And I know that it's hard.
I've never been in a hospital.

18:30.684 --> 18:32.722
I've never been like this before.

18:32.851 --> 18:35.884
But I just think we ought
to help each other, OK?

18:36.018 --> 18:39.051
I know that sometimes when we
ask you to do something to help,

18:39.184 --> 18:41.471
sometimes you don't wanna go upstairs
cos you get scared.

18:41.601 --> 18:44.967
- And that's fine, I understand that.
- Dad's fault.

18:45.101 --> 18:50.303
If it's because you're scared to go
upstairs by yourself, just tell me that.

18:50.434 --> 18:53.930
I will!
Sometimes you're going down.

18:54.059 --> 18:58.717
- And stop videotaping!
- I'll give you the camera, too.

18:58.851 --> 19:02.430
We're gonna do a project,
a family project, OK?

19:02.559 --> 19:05.557
Can we all agree
to do the family project?

19:05.684 --> 19:08.386
- Do you want the camera?
- What?

19:08.518 --> 19:10.555
Do you want the camera
to videotape me?

19:10.684 --> 19:13.255
- Hm-mm.
- It's gonna be a family project.

19:13.393 --> 19:15.348
I need to have a happy boy today, OK?

19:15.476 --> 19:18.178
You have to be happy
if you have the video camera, though.

19:18.309 --> 19:21.556
- Why?
- Because it's a happy film.

19:22.809 --> 19:25.215
- Right?
- And it has a happy ending.

21:01.809 --> 21:05.092
OK, we're coming in!

21:05.226 --> 21:08.058
First of all,
and I'm sure he hears me by now,

21:08.184 --> 21:10.056
let me explain something to you.

21:10.184 --> 21:12.803
Everyone, can you hear me
loud and clear?

21:12.934 --> 21:16.382
My son was supposed to be
cleaning his room yesterday.

21:16.518 --> 21:17.761
Come on!

21:17.893 --> 21:19.599
Boy!

21:19.726 --> 21:22.012
- Woman!
- Woman.

21:22.143 --> 21:27.262
Oh, it's gonna be
a long day, as most are.

21:29.143 --> 21:33.432
He's always a bundle of joy
when he wakes up.

21:33.559 --> 21:36.427
Come on, come get in the shower.
Get the day going.

21:36.559 --> 21:41.430
We got things to do. Places to go.
People to see. Futures to make.

22:17.934 --> 22:21.715
No job is too big or too small.

22:21.851 --> 22:25.797
And even down to a few
minutes ago just wiping my bum,

22:25.934 --> 22:29.134
because I... I had
my first, first poop.

22:33.143 --> 22:35.264
In a bloody a week or so.

22:35.393 --> 22:38.260
So one of them
came to the rescue and said,

22:38.393 --> 22:41.556
"Listen, would you like me
to trim that up for you, sir?"

22:41.684 --> 22:43.260
So I said yes.

22:43.393 --> 22:50.302
And, and, er, a very, very, very,
erm, erm, courageous young lady,

22:50.434 --> 22:54.179
in my case I think, er, did the job.

22:54.309 --> 22:58.137
And, and, er, just, er, just,
er, all in a day's work.

23:01.018 --> 23:03.932
I'm, I'm very, very grateful

23:04.059 --> 23:07.093
for these people
that have treated me like...

23:19.268 --> 23:21.803
...just treated me so well.

23:24.893 --> 23:27.464
And... in a short, short while...

23:32.643 --> 23:35.392
...Iâ€™ll, I'll, I will be
on a road to recovery.

23:35.518 --> 23:38.966
And I'll be out there again
doing crazy things.

23:40.184 --> 23:42.886
And enjoying life.

23:43.018 --> 23:46.430
Here's the mask.
Would you lean forward for me?

24:20.893 --> 24:25.965
I'm Amanda. What makes me joyful
this Saturday is this.

24:26.101 --> 24:28.850
A little terrified. And really excited.

26:29.476 --> 26:32.593
"A Day At A Time"

26:32.726 --> 26:36.720
I wanna drink
from the clearest water

26:36.851 --> 26:41.176
I wanna eat the things I ought to

26:41.309 --> 26:44.260
I'm just one, I know

26:44.393 --> 26:48.718
But I feel strong, you know

26:48.851 --> 26:53.010
I wanna reach the greatest mountain

26:53.143 --> 26:56.804
Climb if I want
without all the shouting

26:56.934 --> 27:00.265
I'm just one, I know

27:00.393 --> 27:04.931
But I feel strong, you know

27:05.059 --> 27:09.053
Clouds really should be white at least

27:09.184 --> 27:12.799
And oceans should meet us
at the beach

27:12.934 --> 27:16.347
And I don't want to over-reach

27:16.476 --> 27:20.849
When I know what's in store
Roar!

27:20.976 --> 27:24.804
Love life a day at a time, boy

27:24.934 --> 27:28.679
Love life a day at a time, girl

27:28.809 --> 27:30.599
Love

27:32.768 --> 27:34.972
Love

27:44.726 --> 27:48.767
I wanna drink from the clearest water

27:48.893 --> 27:52.803
I wanna eat the things I ought to

27:52.934 --> 27:56.347
I'm just one, I know

27:56.476 --> 28:00.719
But I feel strong, you know

28:00.851 --> 28:04.761
I wanna reach the greatest mountain

28:04.893 --> 28:08.839
Climb if I want
without all the shouting

28:08.976 --> 28:12.389
I'm just one, I know

28:12.518 --> 28:17.009
But I feel strong, you know

28:17.143 --> 28:20.757
Clouds really should be white at least

28:20.893 --> 28:24.341
And oceans should meet us
at the beach

28:24.476 --> 28:28.256
And I don't want to over-reach

28:28.393 --> 28:32.849
When I know what's in store
Roar!

28:56.601 --> 28:59.172
Good morning, everyone.

28:59.309 --> 29:01.217
Bonjour.

29:01.351 --> 29:02.927
Buenos dias.

29:03.768 --> 29:05.344
Namaste.

29:05.476 --> 29:07.052
Salaam alaikum.

31:12.726 --> 31:14.633
Travel toothbrush and toothpaste.

31:14.768 --> 31:17.517
Essential if you're spending a night
with the goats.

31:35.601 --> 31:38.682
Fifty pesos. Sweet!

31:46.018 --> 31:49.134
Erm, first is a Canadian flag,

31:49.268 --> 31:54.055
because some of my ancestors
were from Nova Scotia, Canada.

31:54.184 --> 31:57.099
Next is a German flag,

31:57.226 --> 32:00.473
because some of my ancestors
were from Germany.

32:00.601 --> 32:03.967
Some of my ancestors
lived in Wisconsin.

32:04.101 --> 32:06.850
Some of my ancestors
were from Poland.

32:06.976 --> 32:11.301
Aoteman that came
in a chocolate egg.

32:11.434 --> 32:13.342
Erm, electric die.

32:13.476 --> 32:16.474
It's an anti-evil eye protector.

32:17.143 --> 32:19.714
Metal saw. Metal eagle.

32:19.851 --> 32:21.308
Metal wheels.

32:22.018 --> 32:24.636
Anybody want some granite?

32:24.768 --> 32:27.339
My name is Randy Ray Sides.

32:27.476 --> 32:30.640
And this is Kenneth V Fletcher's house.

32:30.768 --> 32:33.137
Giant 'I' beam.

32:33.268 --> 32:35.305
Basket with grapes.

32:35.434 --> 32:37.591
Pipe bender.

32:37.726 --> 32:39.135
A billion boxes.

32:39.268 --> 32:40.974
He's kind of a hoarder.

32:42.268 --> 32:44.934
I moved here four years ago.

32:45.059 --> 32:47.180
Er, a terrible drug addict.

32:47.309 --> 32:51.350
And in four years, er,
Ken has done two things.

32:51.476 --> 32:56.512
He has sobered me up
and he has lost everything.

32:56.643 --> 32:58.550
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

32:58.684 --> 33:00.509
Kenneth V Fletcher...

33:12.643 --> 33:15.594
Tomorrow,
Ken leaves for the Canary Islands,

33:15.726 --> 33:19.257
where he has gotten a job
as a massage therapist.

33:19.393 --> 33:22.260
And I go back to Nebraska,

33:22.393 --> 33:25.758
er, where I'm going to be
living with my folks.

33:27.309 --> 33:29.549
He's one of those guys
that has a billion ideas

33:29.684 --> 33:32.054
and never completes any of 'em.

33:32.184 --> 33:36.095
Ken wanted a piano as a kid.
Ken couldn't get a piano as a kid.

33:36.226 --> 33:39.887
So, three years ago, we looked
on Craigslist all summer

33:40.018 --> 33:45.386
and went over the Twin Cities
and got... pianos!

33:54.851 --> 33:57.340
Man's a genius.
He just never quite had the time.

33:59.268 --> 34:02.219
And it looks like the auctioneer's here.

34:07.268 --> 34:09.554
What's in my pocket?

34:09.684 --> 34:11.675
Well, it's a key.

34:12.726 --> 34:17.880
And, er, it's got a really
neat little logo there.

34:21.934 --> 34:24.719
This... is a Lamborghini.

34:26.226 --> 34:28.761
And this is my life in a day.

34:30.768 --> 34:33.091
This is my wallet from Marc Jacobs.

34:33.226 --> 34:37.469
There's a Marc Jacobs key-chain
that I love.

34:37.601 --> 34:38.844
Mirror.

34:40.684 --> 34:43.054
My iPod which is my soul.

34:43.184 --> 34:44.641
Rosary.

34:44.768 --> 34:49.389
Very good way of spending your time
profitably in the eternal dimension.

34:49.518 --> 34:51.342
Telephone headset.

34:51.476 --> 34:56.809
Extremely good way of wasting
your time in the earthly dimension.

36:29.268 --> 36:31.140
What do you have in your pockets?

36:31.268 --> 36:33.591
It's my knife. Erm...

36:33.726 --> 36:35.764
OK, you can go ahead
and judge me all you want,

36:35.893 --> 36:37.883
but there are some crazy people
in the world.

36:39.393 --> 36:44.465
My Ruger P94.40 calibre handgun.

36:45.309 --> 36:49.303
'I take this with me wherever I go.'

43:23.018 --> 43:25.341
This is balut.

43:26.893 --> 43:29.298
Only in the Philippines.

43:30.601 --> 43:32.675
You see that?

43:32.809 --> 43:36.424
Look, let's put some salt right there.

43:37.643 --> 43:39.100
That's salt.

43:39.226 --> 43:41.466
And then... watch this.

45:18.934 --> 45:20.427
Ahhh!

45:39.226 --> 45:43.006
Today is Saturday 24th July.

45:44.101 --> 45:47.467
For the last three years
I've been away from home.

45:47.601 --> 45:51.097
I was doing my degree,
and as soon as that finished,

45:51.226 --> 45:55.267
I ended up getting a job
at a very demanding company.

45:56.393 --> 46:01.050
So, I don't really get to see
my old man that much.

46:01.184 --> 46:03.056
But whenever I do see him,

46:03.184 --> 46:07.178
we always go to the same place,
do the same thing and have a catch up.

46:08.934 --> 46:11.008
I just phoned you.

46:11.143 --> 46:13.596
Yeah, I just got it, actually.
I was about to phone you back.

46:13.726 --> 46:15.384
- How you doing? All right?
- Not bad.

46:15.518 --> 46:17.259
- Mouthful?
- I'll have a mouthful.

46:17.393 --> 46:19.716
You sorted the tyre out?

46:19.851 --> 46:21.842
- That tyre's fucked.
- I haven't had time.

46:21.976 --> 46:23.634
That tyre's fucked.
You'll get done for that.

46:23.768 --> 46:26.303
Seen it? You got a rip in it.

46:27.434 --> 46:29.508
- Is there a rip?
- Yeah.

46:29.643 --> 46:33.340
Why don't you film down there, Jack,
let's see if we see a cop?

46:33.476 --> 46:34.933
Jesus!

46:35.059 --> 46:37.726
You're not a student now, you know,
you're a working man.

46:37.851 --> 46:39.392
There's no excuse.

46:48.309 --> 46:50.265
Two small beefburgers,
believe it or not.

46:50.393 --> 46:53.805
Imagine what their large ones are like
or medium ones. Ridiculous, isn't it?

46:53.934 --> 46:56.767
Unbelievable.
Anyway, there you go, Jack.

46:56.893 --> 47:00.056
This way. I'm gonna sit in the car.

47:24.809 --> 47:27.973
- What you got?
- This.

47:28.101 --> 47:30.720
Oh. Is this a photograph of you at uni?

47:30.851 --> 47:32.308
- Yeah.
- Fantastic.

47:34.893 --> 47:37.642
That's fantastic. I'm gonna get that
in a lovely frame and that,

47:37.768 --> 47:39.972
cos Nina's got a frame like that.

47:41.684 --> 47:44.173
That's really cool, Jack.
Thank you.

47:44.309 --> 47:47.058
Now you should be very proud
of yourself, Jack,

47:47.184 --> 47:50.597
considering you almost got
chucked out of school.

47:51.726 --> 47:54.594
You was lucky there, weren't you?

47:54.726 --> 47:58.636
You've matured actually in the last year
or so into a real proper lad.

47:58.768 --> 48:01.256
A real gentleman and a nice boy.

48:08.851 --> 48:11.091
Thanks for that, Jack.

49:30.601 --> 49:32.675
I love being me.

49:32.809 --> 49:36.056
I love life. It's all such fun.

49:43.893 --> 49:45.551
Grass, dirt.

49:46.518 --> 49:48.307
Dirty river smell.

49:48.434 --> 49:51.349
Hmm, smell of a campfire
that gets stuck in your hair.

49:51.476 --> 49:54.924
Coated chicken baked in the oven
with seasonings.

49:55.059 --> 49:57.264
What do I love the most?

50:00.934 --> 50:02.392
Well...

50:04.268 --> 50:06.342
...you're looking at her.

50:09.309 --> 50:11.430
I really love my family.

50:11.559 --> 50:13.384
My brothers and sisters.

50:26.226 --> 50:30.551
- What do you love the most?
- Er, women. So much.

50:36.018 --> 50:38.423
I love you, Julia.

50:39.476 --> 50:41.716
You are my only love.

50:41.851 --> 50:44.091
You are my first love.

50:44.226 --> 50:46.893
For me, love is all about you.

50:54.059 --> 50:56.382
I love my wife. I love my son.

50:56.518 --> 50:59.184
I love my land. I love my animals.

50:59.309 --> 51:03.255
My dogs. My ferret. My chickens.
My horses in the background.

51:03.393 --> 51:05.051
I love my life.

51:05.184 --> 51:06.974
But what do I love the most?

51:07.101 --> 51:10.549
I love my Lord.
My heavenly Father. My creator.

51:10.684 --> 51:13.220
From whom all blessings flow.

51:13.351 --> 51:19.762
I love doing about 150 miles an hour
down a motorway, in a good car.

51:19.893 --> 51:21.551
I love football.

51:21.684 --> 51:24.884
I think football is only sport
that bring people together.

51:45.851 --> 51:47.806
- What do you love?
- Women.

51:47.934 --> 51:50.257
- What do you love?
- Freedom.

51:50.393 --> 51:52.846
- What do you love?
- Power.

51:55.434 --> 51:58.468
I love the word Mamihlapinatapai.

51:58.601 --> 52:03.934
It's from the Yaghan language
which is now a dead language.

52:04.059 --> 52:07.390
But it was spoken in Tierra del Fuego,

52:07.518 --> 52:11.428
the very southernmost point
of South America.

52:11.559 --> 52:16.347
I've never heard the word said properly
so I could be pronouncing it wrong.

52:16.476 --> 52:19.640
But the meaning is quite beautiful.
It means...

52:21.018 --> 52:23.008
...that moment or feeling

52:23.143 --> 52:26.259
when two people both want
to initiate something

52:26.393 --> 52:28.881
but neither wants to be
the one to start it.

52:29.018 --> 52:33.841
It can be, perhaps, two tribal leaders
both wanting to make peace

52:33.976 --> 52:36.844
but neither wanting to be
the one to begin it.

52:36.976 --> 52:40.057
Or it could be two people at a party
wanting to approach each other

52:40.184 --> 52:43.135
and neither quite brave enough
to make the first move.

52:45.143 --> 52:47.264
You can hear the kookaburras now.

53:18.934 --> 53:23.343
Currently I'm calling my mom to ask her
what I should say to Emily today.

53:25.809 --> 53:27.966
- 'Hello? '
- Do you have a second to talk to me?

53:28.101 --> 53:31.052
- 'Sure.'
- Tonight I am hanging out with Emily.

53:31.184 --> 53:35.130
But I was planning on telling her
exactly how I feel about her,

53:35.268 --> 53:36.891
and then I don't know.

53:37.018 --> 53:39.720
So I was calling my mother to see
what should I say to this woman.

53:43.101 --> 53:44.677
'OK... '

53:57.893 --> 54:01.803
'I don't know. I just think that...
concentrate on the fact that,

54:01.934 --> 54:06.805
'you have very, very high feelings
obviously for her.

54:06.934 --> 54:08.759
'That she's somebody
you always admired... '

54:08.893 --> 54:12.140
Esteem? Is that the word
I should use? Esteem?

54:12.268 --> 54:15.219
- Do you think she'll like that?
- 'Well, why not? Yeah, whatever.

54:15.351 --> 54:18.847
- I just don't know if that's...
- 'You hold her in very high regard.'

54:18.976 --> 54:21.381
- I don't know if those are...
- 'She's the special person in your life.'

54:21.518 --> 54:23.592
OK. I'll try all that.

54:24.768 --> 54:31.345
'And you would like to find out if there's
a possibility of being her boyfriend... '

54:33.476 --> 54:35.799
Hey, I'm on the train now.

54:35.934 --> 54:38.091
This is my friend Emily.

54:54.934 --> 54:59.473
Hello, life in a day. I'm still with Emily
and we're still hanging out in Chicago.

54:59.601 --> 55:01.556
Erm, this is...

55:01.684 --> 55:05.299
We just came out of this place
which was cool.

55:05.434 --> 55:08.681
But I'm gonna leave this thing on
in case anything gets climatic.

55:13.018 --> 55:15.553
Theresa, look at me.

55:15.684 --> 55:17.142
Off!

55:17.893 --> 55:19.848
Oh, my God!

55:32.434 --> 55:35.717
Well, so here's the deal.

55:35.851 --> 55:39.596
I asked her if she wanted to go on
a romantic date with me some time,

55:39.726 --> 55:43.506
and she says, er, no.
Just, just no.

55:43.643 --> 55:46.427
That's really all she said, no.

55:46.559 --> 55:50.256
She didn't want any of that.
Ever. Possibly never, ever.

55:50.393 --> 55:54.849
And so actually I said, "What about
the possibility of a possibility?"

55:54.976 --> 55:58.306
And she said no to that.
No possibility. None.

56:09.726 --> 56:14.846
OK. Let me say that it is meant
for women to kneel down.

56:14.976 --> 56:20.392
For example, a woman is supposed
to kneel down for a man.

56:20.518 --> 56:23.516
Do you want to show us
how you do it?

56:23.643 --> 56:26.427
So you greet Moses
like traditionally.

56:36.018 --> 56:38.589
Wow! Wow!

56:38.726 --> 56:40.930
Moses, how do you feel about it?

56:41.059 --> 56:43.761
She comes in
and she kneels down every day.

56:43.893 --> 56:49.641
Yes. Because I'm a man
she has to respect.

56:49.768 --> 56:51.758
It's the culture.

58:23.101 --> 58:24.891
Hi, grandma.

58:25.018 --> 58:27.423
It's David. How are you?

58:27.559 --> 58:31.256
I'm good. I'm still in New York.

58:31.393 --> 58:35.303
It's, yeah, it's been really hot here.
Erm, but I'm having fun.

58:35.434 --> 58:39.677
Er, anyway, I wanted to call you
because, erm...

58:40.934 --> 58:45.259
...you know my friend, er, Nick
that you've met a lot?

58:45.393 --> 58:49.339
Yeah. Yeah, I know,
he's a very, he's a very nice boy.

58:50.643 --> 58:55.928
Well, I wanted to tell you that
he's, erm, not... not just my friend,

58:56.059 --> 58:58.180
he's, he's my boyfriend.

58:58.309 --> 59:05.017
Er, and it's something that I've wanted
to tell you for a while but, erm...

59:05.143 --> 59:07.761
I wasn't really sure
how you would react.

59:07.893 --> 59:11.258
So I was a little nervous
to tell you. Erm...

59:13.559 --> 59:16.759
I, I love, I love you, too. Yeah.

59:16.893 --> 59:18.350
I love you, too.

59:18.476 --> 59:23.050
And I'm hoping that,
that maybe you can love Nick too.

59:23.184 --> 59:26.266
Erm... because he's really
important to me

59:26.393 --> 59:30.801
and so I'm hoping he can be
really important to you too.

59:33.768 --> 59:35.509
Yeah.

59:35.643 --> 59:38.676
Well, that, that means a lot to me.
Yeah.

59:40.059 --> 59:41.517
Thank you.

59:42.893 --> 59:46.341
I... Yeah, I love, I love you, too.

59:48.018 --> 59:49.890
And you, yeah.

59:50.018 --> 59:52.304
No, my parents know, yes.

59:55.101 --> 59:57.720
Well, grandma,
they call it being gay now.

59:57.851 --> 01:00:00.174
You don't have to say homosexual.

01:00:00.309 --> 01:00:02.715
It's not... Yeah, it's...

01:00:02.851 --> 01:00:06.679
Yes, it's not, it's not a disease.
Thank you!

01:00:09.643 --> 01:00:12.427
Here, throw some cheese
to those ducks.

01:00:12.559 --> 01:00:15.048
Get closer to 'em,
I'm taking a video, Sarah.

01:00:15.184 --> 01:00:18.632
- They might bite me.
- No, they won't bite. Ducks don't bite.

01:00:18.768 --> 01:00:20.557
Come on, I'm making a video.

01:00:20.684 --> 01:00:22.924
Walk on out into 'em,
it'll be a good video.

01:00:23.059 --> 01:00:25.808
Would you like me
to take a picture of you?

01:00:25.934 --> 01:00:29.016
- Thank you.
- Just tell me what do you want me to do.

01:00:29.143 --> 01:00:31.714
Just go like this.

01:00:31.851 --> 01:00:37.053
Love is a battlefield.'

01:00:39.184 --> 01:00:43.308
Listen, you two are going to fight
like hooded roosters.

01:00:43.434 --> 01:00:46.219
But just get it out there.
It's science.

01:00:46.351 --> 01:00:51.008
You know, place any two animals
in a contained area together,

01:00:51.143 --> 01:00:53.892
you know,
there will be awesome tenderness

01:00:54.018 --> 01:00:56.553
but also there will be blood.

01:00:59.268 --> 01:01:02.550
That is my pocket, Walt Whitman.
Please.

01:01:02.684 --> 01:01:04.841
He was surely one
of the greatest poets that ever lived.

01:01:04.976 --> 01:01:07.262
If my babies can read
Walt Whitman day and night

01:01:07.393 --> 01:01:10.841
and learn from him,
I'll be very happy.

01:01:10.976 --> 01:01:13.465
After all, babies, he did say...

01:01:14.851 --> 01:01:18.098
"I am august

01:01:18.226 --> 01:01:23.298
"I do not trouble my soul
to vindicate itself"

01:01:23.434 --> 01:01:26.302
No, he didn't say soul,
he said "I do not...

01:01:26.434 --> 01:01:28.674
That's enough,
you'll use up all the memory!

01:01:28.809 --> 01:01:31.179
This is self-indulgent
and please stop.

01:01:31.309 --> 01:01:33.632
They need winding.
Please stop, Tristram.

01:01:33.768 --> 01:01:38.555
- "...trouble my spirit to vindicate..."
- Stop being so selfish!

01:01:38.684 --> 01:01:41.137
I've been looking after them all day.
Just stop it.

01:01:41.268 --> 01:01:43.554
"I do not trouble my soul to...
I do not trouble my spirit...

01:01:43.684 --> 01:01:48.141
- For Christ's sake, Tristram, stop it.
- "...to vindicate itself or be understood."

01:01:48.268 --> 01:01:50.637
OK, fine.

01:01:51.893 --> 01:01:53.967
Ann and John are today
renewing their vows

01:01:54.101 --> 01:01:57.846
in the light of their 50 years'
experience of marriage.

01:01:57.976 --> 01:02:00.760
Rather unusually,
each of this special couple

01:02:00.893 --> 01:02:03.381
has agreed to write the vows
of the other.

01:02:03.518 --> 01:02:07.511
That is, Ann has written John's vows
and John has written Ann's.

01:02:30.434 --> 01:02:34.262
John, it is necessary to address
one or two shortcomings

01:02:34.393 --> 01:02:38.469
in... ahem!
...the physical side of marriage.

01:02:38.601 --> 01:02:42.132
Surely no one would argue that
there are certain physical demands

01:02:42.268 --> 01:02:44.389
a wife can request of her husband.

01:02:44.518 --> 01:02:48.511
And, Ann, I ask you that
you address these issues right now.

01:02:51.476 --> 01:02:54.344
Do you agree to wash the windows
inside and out?

01:03:15.643 --> 01:03:18.557
John asks if you will agree
to let him do that thing

01:03:18.684 --> 01:03:22.015
you once told him you would let him
do on his 40th birthday

01:03:22.143 --> 01:03:24.299
but still not have yet done.

01:03:32.518 --> 01:03:36.298
So, Ann, in anticipation
of your previous answer,

01:03:36.434 --> 01:03:39.681
John says, "I suppose
an occasional blow-job

01:03:39.809 --> 01:03:41.847
"is completely out of the question?"

01:03:57.143 --> 01:04:02.926
Finally, in spite of men obviously being
from Mars and women from Venus,

01:04:03.059 --> 01:04:05.892
do you both promise to love
and treasure each other

01:04:06.018 --> 01:04:09.679
and enjoy your lovely family life
together here at Appletree Cottage,

01:04:09.809 --> 01:04:12.179
for as long as you both shall live?

01:04:12.309 --> 01:04:14.051
We do.

01:10:09.559 --> 01:10:11.882
Do the jerk.
Please do the jerk.

01:10:15.309 --> 01:10:17.928
By the end, I'm gonna get
the Commander to do the jerk.

01:10:19.643 --> 01:10:21.550
Why you gotta stick your tongue out?

01:10:21.684 --> 01:10:23.391
Punch Easton in the face.

01:10:23.518 --> 01:10:25.176
Oh, my God!

01:10:26.351 --> 01:10:31.008
That's the Rebel Alliance.
And there is the Empire.

01:10:32.726 --> 01:10:35.179
Hi. This is my room.

01:10:37.434 --> 01:10:39.674
And this is our garden.

01:10:41.434 --> 01:10:44.053
So my name is Masoud Hossaini.

01:10:44.184 --> 01:10:48.758
I live in Afghanistan, Kabul,
and I'm a news photographer.

01:10:48.893 --> 01:10:50.599
Here is my house.

01:10:50.726 --> 01:10:52.930
And he's my father, drinking tea.

01:10:53.893 --> 01:10:56.298
My mother is praying.

01:10:56.434 --> 01:11:02.798
Farid, my brother, is just again
staring in the refrigerator as always.

01:11:23.268 --> 01:11:27.261
Right now, I'm in my car
going to Kabul's old city

01:11:27.393 --> 01:11:29.549
to take some pictures.

01:11:29.684 --> 01:11:32.552
Sometimes I like to just
walk around there

01:11:32.684 --> 01:11:34.509
looking for a good shot.

01:11:34.643 --> 01:11:36.929
These are like my two babies.

01:11:37.059 --> 01:11:39.050
I carry them everywhere.

01:11:40.101 --> 01:11:42.139
- Salaam.
- Salaam alaikum.

01:11:47.476 --> 01:11:50.427
'Here I am. By myself.'

01:11:50.559 --> 01:11:54.635
'Because my husband is
a half a world away,

01:11:54.768 --> 01:11:57.600
'going to work, fighting for us.'

01:11:59.268 --> 01:12:03.641
What shirt should I wear? Which one
do you think will Phil like better?

01:12:03.768 --> 01:12:06.386
Hmm? Which one do you think?

01:12:06.518 --> 01:12:09.220
That one? Is that one the best?

01:12:11.018 --> 01:12:13.720
Here is the market
in the old city.

01:12:13.851 --> 01:12:18.887
Most foreigners think it is dangerous
to walk around the streets of Kabul,

01:12:19.018 --> 01:12:23.225
but, as you can see,
there is no danger for us anyway.

01:12:27.518 --> 01:12:29.555
Waiting game

01:12:30.559 --> 01:12:31.969
Waiting game

01:12:51.768 --> 01:12:55.892
So this is a street that's normally
selling birds like this.

01:12:56.018 --> 01:12:57.641
They call them love birds

01:12:57.768 --> 01:13:00.470
because they are always
kissing each other.

01:13:03.351 --> 01:13:05.472
Where are you?

01:13:07.268 --> 01:13:09.140
'Hi, Sharon.'

01:13:11.101 --> 01:13:12.891
Hi.

01:13:13.809 --> 01:13:16.132
- 'Hi.'
- How's it going?

01:13:17.684 --> 01:13:19.805
Can you see me?

01:13:23.476 --> 01:13:26.047
Of course, it's our date night.

01:13:35.976 --> 01:13:38.891
Afghanistan,
the name of my country,

01:13:39.018 --> 01:13:42.632
comes with the conflict,
war, suicide attack,

01:13:42.768 --> 01:13:47.591
and all the negative points that
we hear and listen in the news.

01:13:47.726 --> 01:13:53.675
But there is another side of Afghanistan
that you don't normally see.

01:13:53.809 --> 01:13:59.011
These girls make me feel optimistic
about the future of my country.

01:14:01.809 --> 01:14:03.385
'I love you.'

01:14:03.518 --> 01:14:06.267
I love you, too. Stay safe.

01:14:07.268 --> 01:14:09.223
'I will, honey. You too, OK?

01:14:09.351 --> 01:14:10.808
OK.

01:14:12.101 --> 01:14:14.139
- 'Bye.'
- Bye.

01:16:05.976 --> 01:16:08.132
Daddy, you seen my war?

01:16:08.268 --> 01:16:13.601
Oh, and the red is bad,
the white is good of the helmets.

01:16:35.268 --> 01:16:37.673
Oh, it's not so bad.
No?

01:16:38.601 --> 01:16:41.054
Is there something that's
bleeding under my arm?

01:16:41.184 --> 01:16:43.258
Let's see if I can just get this.

01:16:43.393 --> 01:16:47.090
Oh, oh what, what is it?

01:16:47.226 --> 01:16:49.928
What is it?
Did that come out of your hair?

01:16:50.059 --> 01:16:53.010
No, it was on my back.
It's a ladybug.

01:16:59.768 --> 01:17:01.842
Any kind of monster.

01:17:01.976 --> 01:17:03.718
Or ghosts.

01:17:03.851 --> 01:17:05.641
Or a witch.

01:17:07.018 --> 01:17:08.973
What do zombies do?

01:17:09.101 --> 01:17:11.341
OK, you do a great zombie.

01:17:26.726 --> 01:17:28.135
I have a fear of dogs.

01:17:31.184 --> 01:17:32.049
Wasps.

01:17:32.184 --> 01:17:33.049
Spiders.

01:17:33.184 --> 01:17:36.680
I fear... robbers.

01:17:37.768 --> 01:17:39.225
Rapers.

01:17:39.351 --> 01:17:41.804
I fear growing up.

01:17:41.934 --> 01:17:44.470
I'm afraid of losing this place.

01:18:03.768 --> 01:18:05.640
I am afraid of homosexuality.

01:18:05.768 --> 01:18:09.808
Homosexuality is like... is like disease,

01:18:09.934 --> 01:18:12.423
and I am afraid of disease.

01:18:12.559 --> 01:18:15.890
I stay in my room and
all I can think about is whether,

01:18:16.018 --> 01:18:18.423
in a couple of years,
someone else is gonna live here,

01:18:18.559 --> 01:18:22.304
someone who is not Israeli,
maybe someone Palestinian.

01:18:22.434 --> 01:18:26.380
I guess politics scares me
more than anything.

01:18:26.518 --> 01:18:29.718
I wonder if we're gonna get
in another war.

01:18:51.434 --> 01:18:54.136
One of the things I fear more
than anything right now

01:18:54.268 --> 01:18:57.349
is that my hair has started
to fall out.

01:18:57.476 --> 01:18:59.099
This is me.

01:19:00.309 --> 01:19:02.679
This is what I'm afraid of.

01:19:02.809 --> 01:19:05.807
That my husband will leave me
for another wife,

01:19:05.934 --> 01:19:09.016
because of our lack
of "you know what".

01:19:14.351 --> 01:19:17.135
I fear loneliness.

01:19:18.434 --> 01:19:22.131
Not waking up one morning,
and nobody finding you for a week.

01:19:22.268 --> 01:19:23.677
That'd be interesting.

01:19:27.393 --> 01:19:30.556
That's why I find it
very hard to really...

01:19:32.268 --> 01:19:34.305
...really connect with someone.

01:19:34.434 --> 01:19:36.970
Because what do you do
when they're gone?

01:19:48.643 --> 01:19:52.506
And that's what I'm afraid of.
Being in this grave.

01:19:52.643 --> 01:19:56.304
Life is so frickin' short, you know.

01:19:58.726 --> 01:20:00.633
Dying, I guess.

01:20:51.684 --> 01:20:54.054
Three, two, one...

01:21:08.518 --> 01:21:10.841
Welcome to Love Parade!

01:21:34.601 --> 01:21:37.469
Oh, come and have a look!

01:22:59.059 --> 01:23:01.299
Many of the thousands
of revellers were unaware

01:23:01.434 --> 01:23:04.101
of the tragedy unfolding
at the tunnel entrance.

01:23:53.643 --> 01:23:56.890
I wanna drink from the greatest water

01:23:57.018 --> 01:24:01.142
I wanna have all the things I ought to

01:24:01.268 --> 01:24:04.384
I'm just one, I know

01:24:04.518 --> 01:24:08.594
But I feel strong, you know

01:24:08.726 --> 01:24:13.300
I wanna reach the golden fountain

01:24:13.434 --> 01:24:17.131
Beat everyone without all the doubting

01:24:17.268 --> 01:24:20.349
I'm just one, I know

01:24:20.476 --> 01:24:24.719
But I feel strong, you know

01:24:24.851 --> 01:24:29.094
Crowds really should be right,
at least

01:24:29.226 --> 01:24:32.805
Oceans should be there
at the beach

01:24:32.934 --> 01:24:36.928
Who needs books
when we've got speech?

01:24:37.059 --> 01:24:40.887
Cos who knows
what's in store? Roar!

01:24:41.018 --> 01:24:44.881
Love life a penny at a time,
boy

01:24:45.018 --> 01:24:49.058
Love life a penny at a time, girl

01:24:49.184 --> 01:24:52.052
Love life a penny at a time...

01:26:26.726 --> 01:26:29.179
Who do you love?

01:26:29.309 --> 01:26:31.265
My silly boys.

01:26:31.393 --> 01:26:33.182
The Bobby-ells.

01:26:36.184 --> 01:26:38.720
OK, what do you fear?

01:26:40.643 --> 01:26:44.968
Well, I guess...
I'm fearless now.

01:26:46.518 --> 01:26:50.926
I guess my fear was that
you'd get cancer and you did.

01:26:51.059 --> 01:26:53.974
That you'd get it again, I mean,
and you did.

01:26:54.101 --> 01:26:55.891
But it's over with.

01:26:56.018 --> 01:26:58.055
So I'm fearless.

01:29:57.726 --> 01:30:00.131
July 24th, 2010.

01:30:03.851 --> 01:30:07.679
It's nearly midnight now and
I'm running out of time to make this.

01:30:07.809 --> 01:30:11.506
I worked all day long.
On a Saturday! Yeah, I know.

01:30:13.518 --> 01:30:16.136
The sad part is,

01:30:16.268 --> 01:30:20.214
I spent all day long hoping
for something amazing to happen,

01:30:20.351 --> 01:30:24.676
something great,
something to appreciate this day,

01:30:24.809 --> 01:30:27.642
and to be a part of it,
and to...

01:30:28.934 --> 01:30:33.259
...show the world that
there's something great

01:30:33.393 --> 01:30:36.675
that can happen every day
of your life, in everyone's life.

01:30:36.809 --> 01:30:39.345
But the truth is,
it doesn't always happen.

01:30:39.476 --> 01:30:41.514
And for me, today...

01:30:43.851 --> 01:30:47.264
...all day long,
nothing really happened.

01:30:51.518 --> 01:30:54.599
I want people to know that I'm here.

01:30:55.476 --> 01:30:58.095
I don't wanna cease to exist.

01:31:07.726 --> 01:31:11.506
I'm not gonna sit here and tell you
that I'm this great person because...

01:31:12.726 --> 01:31:15.724
...I don't think I am, at all.

01:31:15.851 --> 01:31:17.925
I think I'm a normal girl.

01:31:19.184 --> 01:31:21.056
Normal life.

01:31:23.059 --> 01:31:25.133
Not interesting enough...

01:31:26.726 --> 01:31:29.475
...to know anything about.

01:31:30.643 --> 01:31:32.847
But I want to be.

01:31:36.768 --> 01:31:38.426
And today...

01:31:41.809 --> 01:31:43.516
...even though...

01:31:45.393 --> 01:31:48.889
...even though nothing great
really happened,

01:31:49.018 --> 01:31:53.805
tonight I feel as if something
great happened.

01:32:06.726 --> 01:32:10.590
I wanna drink from the clearest water

01:32:10.726 --> 01:32:14.590
I wanna eat the things I know to

01:32:14.726 --> 01:32:18.056
I'm just one, I know

01:32:18.184 --> 01:32:22.557
But I feel strong, you know

01:32:22.684 --> 01:32:26.595
I wanna reach the greatest mountain

01:32:26.726 --> 01:32:30.506
Climb if I want,
without all the shouting

01:32:30.643 --> 01:32:33.973
I'm just one, I know

01:32:34.101 --> 01:32:38.842
But I feel strong, you know...
