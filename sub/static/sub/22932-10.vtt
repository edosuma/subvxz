00:00.420 --> 00:02.830
♪♪

00:06.000 --> 00:07.080
It's spring break,

00:07.080 --> 00:09.120
which means I have a whole week
off from school.

00:09.120 --> 00:11.670
So why am I not smiling?

00:11.670 --> 00:15.120
Because for the Diazes,
spring break means...

00:15.120 --> 00:17.460
spring cleaning.

00:29.460 --> 00:31.380
Why do I have
to dust the kayaks?

00:31.380 --> 00:32.620
Once they're in the water,

00:32.620 --> 00:34.500
the ocean does all the work
for them.

00:34.500 --> 00:36.460
I know this isn't
everyone's favorite week...

00:36.460 --> 00:38.500
Yeah, that's next week,
when this is over.

00:38.500 --> 00:40.830
...but the Bait & Bite
is our family business.

00:40.830 --> 00:43.000
That means family
needs to maintain it.

00:43.000 --> 00:44.420
And this is the only
time of year

00:44.420 --> 00:46.500
where all of you
have nothing else to do.

00:46.500 --> 00:48.380
Where's Daphne?

00:48.380 --> 00:51.790
Unless she plans on selling her
favorite boots, I think I know.

00:57.460 --> 00:59.750
You can't make me clean.

00:59.750 --> 01:02.420
I have boot hands.

01:02.420 --> 01:05.120
I think I'm coming down
with boot hands too.

01:05.120 --> 01:07.920
He's my twin.
I should take care of him.

01:07.920 --> 01:11.460
I just love him
so much.

01:12.920 --> 01:14.880
Good, I need your help.

01:14.880 --> 01:17.170
The cleaning crew just started
their annual mutiny.

01:17.170 --> 01:19.460
Ooh, smart, you came
with your upset face.

01:19.460 --> 01:20.750
You're way ahead of me.

01:20.750 --> 01:22.420
Because I just lost out
on a big payday.

01:23.830 --> 01:25.790
I arranged to have a customer's
boat sail from here,

01:25.790 --> 01:27.460
down the coast to Sandy Bluffs
by the weekend,

01:27.460 --> 01:29.920
-but the captain quit.

01:29.920 --> 01:31.750
Quitting's an option

01:31.750 --> 01:34.540
We've been trying to do it
for hours.

01:34.540 --> 01:37.830
Six kids in desperate need
of a spring break,

01:37.830 --> 01:40.500
and a boat that needs
to get down the coast.

01:40.500 --> 01:43.540
This isn't a problem,
it's an opportunity.

01:43.540 --> 01:45.500
I just have to present it to Dad

01:45.500 --> 01:47.460
in a way that will make him
say "yes."

01:51.170 --> 01:52.750
What is this,
another mutiny?

01:52.750 --> 01:54.500
Where's your mother?
I need backup.

01:54.500 --> 01:56.120
You have your captain's
license.

01:56.120 --> 01:58.080
Why don't you deliver
the boat yourself?

01:58.080 --> 02:00.120
-Guys, we can't just--
-If we leave tomorrow,

02:00.120 --> 02:02.540
we could get there a couple days
early and hang out on the boat

02:02.540 --> 02:04.040
before you have
to deliver it.

02:04.040 --> 02:05.920
It'd be like
a family vacation.

02:05.920 --> 02:07.790
We know planes and buses
don't work for us.

02:07.790 --> 02:09.040
Let's try a boat.

02:09.040 --> 02:10.420
And what about
cleaning the store?

02:10.420 --> 02:13.080
Dad, let's be honest.

02:13.080 --> 02:16.120
We could all use a break
from the Bait & Bite.

02:16.120 --> 02:19.120
This place has got us caught
like a fish on a hook.

02:19.120 --> 02:21.500
But at least the fish
gets away sometimes.

02:21.500 --> 02:25.000
And with the money you make,
we can hire a cleaning crew.

02:25.000 --> 02:27.460
And did you know
Sandy Bluffs offers snorkeling,

02:27.460 --> 02:30.880
whale watching, and for
the water

02:30.880 --> 02:33.460
The town yacht club features
a well-reviewed crab bisque.

02:33.460 --> 02:34.790
And it's displaying
the trophy

02:34.790 --> 02:36.670
from the North Atlantic Regatta.

02:36.670 --> 02:39.460
The N.A.R.? That's the biggest
boat race there is.

02:39.460 --> 02:42.420
It was just won by legendary
three-time champion--

02:42.420 --> 02:43.460
Austin Briggs?

02:44.500 --> 02:45.500
That's right.

02:45.500 --> 02:48.790
You heard what I read
off this card correctly.

02:48.790 --> 02:50.710
He's going to be
at the club too.

02:50.710 --> 02:52.120
You could meet him.

02:52.120 --> 02:54.000
His favorite fish:
haddock.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.080
There's your conversation
starter.

02:56.080 --> 02:58.460
Except yacht clubs are private.
You have to be a member.

02:58.460 --> 03:00.750
Or know a member.
And I have a connection.

03:00.750 --> 03:02.420
Already got you a pass.

03:02.420 --> 03:04.460
But it's not like I have a crew.

03:07.830 --> 03:09.540
Excuse me, sir,

03:09.540 --> 03:10.750
I hear you're looking
for some help

03:10.750 --> 03:13.080
delivering a boat
to paradise.

03:15.920 --> 03:17.420
All right, crew...

03:18.620 --> 03:20.880
you got yourself
a captain.

03:23.460 --> 03:24.540
What's going on here?

03:24.540 --> 03:26.620
You kids are supposed
to be cleaning.

03:26.620 --> 03:28.580
It's okay, Mom.
He's already in.

03:28.580 --> 03:29.670
He is? All right!

03:32.080 --> 03:34.790
Yeah, I don't have
a yacht club connection.

03:34.790 --> 03:36.420
Yet.

03:36.420 --> 03:38.000
I know I made a big promise,

03:38.000 --> 03:39.620
but I'm good
at figuring things out.

03:39.620 --> 03:41.460
Come on, I'm Harley.

03:43.500 --> 03:45.790

This here book says Sandy Bluffs
was a pirate haven.

04:42.750 --> 04:45.040
It's shores be littered
with treasure,

04:45.040 --> 04:48.040
-and it'll soon be ours!
-Yeah!

04:48.040 --> 04:49.790
We're not even
on the boat yet.

04:49.790 --> 04:51.080
And you're not pirates.

04:51.080 --> 04:52.670
She's right.

04:52.670 --> 04:55.460
We need a parrot!

04:55.460 --> 04:56.710
There's one!

04:56.710 --> 04:58.080
-Quick!
-Go, go, go!

04:58.080 --> 05:00.420
That's a pigeon.
Amateurs.

05:01.500 --> 05:04.500
I brought the MagnaWow.

05:04.500 --> 05:05.830
After I do some searching,

05:05.830 --> 05:09.380
I'll be rolling in lost watches
and engagement rings.

05:09.380 --> 05:11.000
That thing took down
our swing set.

05:11.000 --> 05:13.830
Is it safe to have it
in the middle of the ocean?

05:13.830 --> 05:15.710
What if a shark ate a hand
with a ring on it?

05:15.710 --> 05:18.000
Don't worry,
I put a regulator on it

05:18.000 --> 05:19.710
so Daphne won't destroy
playgrounds

05:19.710 --> 05:20.880
up and down the coast.

05:20.880 --> 05:22.670
Cool, because I'm looking
forward

05:22.670 --> 05:24.710
to some relaxing me time.

05:24.710 --> 05:27.580
Or as I like
to call it, E-time.

05:27.580 --> 05:30.670
So Chloe said she wanted
a break from you.

05:30.670 --> 05:32.620
She did indeed.

05:32.620 --> 05:35.040
I found us an extra
crew member.

05:35.040 --> 05:37.380
Say hello to Flat Rachel.

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
And goodbye
to sane Georgie.

05:41.000 --> 05:43.040
When Rachel heard
we were going on spring break,

05:43.040 --> 05:45.380
she was bummed we were taking
another trip without her.

05:45.380 --> 05:48.040
Now I can send her an entire
photo album with her in it.

05:48.040 --> 05:50.500
Good idea. And she'll probably
be more helpful on the boat

05:50.500 --> 05:51.880
than real Rachel.

05:54.830 --> 05:56.710
Oh, good,
you're all finally here.

05:56.710 --> 05:59.500
We're going to sleep on that
for two nights?

05:59.500 --> 06:00.830
Now I know why
the captain quit.

06:00.830 --> 06:02.420
No, this isn't our boat.

06:02.420 --> 06:04.420
I was just helping Jim
hook up his bilge pump.

08:03.620 --> 08:05.000
I'm good company.
Just ask me.

08:05.000 --> 08:07.330
I speak very highly
of myself.

08:07.330 --> 08:09.670
I'm not having such a good time
with myself.

08:09.670 --> 08:12.420
I made a bunch of promises
that I now have to make good on

08:12.420 --> 08:13.620
before I get caught.

08:13.620 --> 08:16.420
Starting with a yacht club pass
for Dad.

08:16.420 --> 08:18.040
Luckily, he's busy with--

08:18.040 --> 08:19.420
Harley!

08:19.420 --> 08:21.830
Me wants to stay
and see what happens next;

08:21.830 --> 08:24.380
myself and I feel like
it won't be very relaxing.

08:24.380 --> 08:26.380
-See you.
-No...

08:26.380 --> 08:28.500
Can I get that pass
to the yacht club?

08:28.500 --> 08:31.750
Pass

08:31.750 --> 08:34.420
I mean, sure, but you're going
to be the first one there.

08:34.420 --> 08:36.420
You're going to look like
a goofy fanboy.

08:36.420 --> 08:39.920
Good point. I don't want to look
too eager for Austin Briggs.

08:39.920 --> 08:43.000
Ooh, I can't believe I'm going
to meet Austin Briggs!

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
You see that? Goofy fanboy.

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
You know what?

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
Why don't you do
some relaxing on the boat?

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
I'll even put on
some yacht rock.

08:51.000 --> 08:54.040
And head into town
so I don't have to listen to it.

08:54.040 --> 08:55.000
Be back before
you leave.

08:55.000 --> 08:57.880
You know what?
Before you go,

08:57.880 --> 08:59.380
I just want to say thanks.

08:59.380 --> 09:02.420
You might want to hold
that thanks until I get back.

09:02.420 --> 09:04.960
No, no, you deserve it.

09:04.960 --> 09:06.460
When you have
a big family,

09:06.460 --> 09:09.880
it is hard to make
vacations happen.

09:09.880 --> 09:10.880
But you did that,

09:10.880 --> 09:14.920
and did something special
just for me.

09:18.830 --> 09:20.960
Ooh, I got to change
into my swim trunks.

09:20.960 --> 09:24.040
I do not want to have a weird
tan line for Austin Briggs.

09:25.920 --> 09:27.580
Smart idea, Dad.

09:27.580 --> 09:29.500
I'll take care of the music
up here.

09:29.500 --> 09:31.380
Some yacht rock
is coming your way,

09:31.380 --> 09:33.330
because you're going
to a yacht club.

09:33.330 --> 09:35.960
That is where you're going.

09:41.040 --> 09:44.330
Hey, turn that music down!

09:47.920 --> 09:52.000
Ah, it's the little know-it-all
from the water park.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.880
Mr. Pillman?

09:53.880 --> 09:54.960
What are you doing here?

09:54.960 --> 09:56.790
What am I doing here?

09:56.790 --> 09:59.000
I live in this charming
marine town,

09:59.000 --> 09:59.960
which was very enjoyable

09:59.960 --> 10:03.460
until we got a sudden influx
of cabana thieves.

10:03.460 --> 10:04.960
The name is Diaz.

10:04.960 --> 10:07.750
And we paid for those cabana
by beating your family

10:07.750 --> 10:09.790
in the Aqualympics.

10:09.790 --> 10:10.960
So, thanks.

10:10.960 --> 10:13.960
Hmm, still as delightful
as I remember.

10:13.960 --> 10:15.960
Look, we're just on vacation.

10:15.960 --> 10:18.000
Let's agree,
we'll stay away from you,

10:18.000 --> 10:19.710
and you stay away from us.

10:19.710 --> 10:20.960
Fine with me.

10:20.960 --> 10:23.120
I'm late for brunch
at the yacht club.

10:23.120 --> 10:25.790
You belong
to the yacht club?

10:25.790 --> 10:27.040
Belong?

10:27.040 --> 10:29.580
I own it.

10:36.620 --> 10:37.960
Oh, boy.

10:37.960 --> 10:39.960
If I had known that jerk
owns the club

10:39.960 --> 10:41.790
I was trying to get Dad into,

10:41.790 --> 10:45.080
I might have put a regulator
on the smack talk.

10:45.080 --> 10:48.080
I think my spring break
just sprung a leak.

10:53.330 --> 10:54.790
I don't know
what's crazier,

10:54.790 --> 10:55.960
that Mr. Pillman's here,

10:55.960 --> 10:58.040
or that you're going
to apologize to him.

10:58.040 --> 10:59.170
What choice do I have?

10:59.170 --> 11:01.170
I have to get Dad
into that club.

11:01.170 --> 11:03.620
Okay, I need to look
really sorry.

11:03.620 --> 11:05.000
Help me work up some tears.

11:05.000 --> 11:06.540
Just think about how crushed
Dad'll be

11:06.540 --> 11:07.790
when he finds out
you lied.

11:07.790 --> 11:09.540
-You're the best.

11:09.540 --> 11:11.290
Ethan?

11:11.290 --> 11:13.000
Hannah?

11:13.000 --> 11:15.380
I haven't seen you
since the water park.

11:15.380 --> 11:16.790
I know. This is crazy.

11:16.790 --> 11:18.670
So, what's new?

11:18.670 --> 11:20.080
That's dumb.

11:20.080 --> 11:22.000
I'm sure there's a lot new.

11:22.000 --> 11:24.080
Sorry, I'm trying to flirt.
How am I doing?

11:24.080 --> 11:26.750
Not great, but still cute.
Want to hang?

11:26.750 --> 11:30.710
Sure, my E-time
just turned into we-time.

11:30.710 --> 11:32.620
Not sure what that means,

11:32.620 --> 11:34.380
but we'd better go.

11:34.380 --> 11:35.500
My dad s in a bad mood.

11:35.500 --> 11:38.120
Some girl on the dock
totally insulted him.

11:38.120 --> 11:39.420
Come on, let's go.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
Hmm.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.500
-Ugh.
-Oh!

11:51.500 --> 11:55.120
Hey, Mr. Pillman.
Weird seeing you here.

11:55.120 --> 11:57.250
At the yacht club
I told you I own?

11:57.250 --> 11:59.210
What part of
"you stay on your turf,

11:59.210 --> 12:01.040
and we stay on ours"
is this?

12:01.040 --> 12:03.250
Two people keeping
to their own yachts?

12:03.250 --> 12:05.920
That's not what
this world is about.

12:05.920 --> 12:07.250
It's about all yacht people

12:07.250 --> 12:09.670
living together
in peace and harmony.

12:09.670 --> 12:11.830
I think George Washington
said that.

12:11.830 --> 12:13.460
Hmm.

12:13.460 --> 12:15.500
Okay.

12:15.500 --> 12:17.500
Sorry for wasting your time.

12:17.500 --> 12:19.500
It's just...

12:19.500 --> 12:22.330
I made a promise
to my dad.

12:22.330 --> 12:24.920
We came all the way down here
from Marshport, and--

12:24.920 --> 12:26.620
-Yeah.

12:26.620 --> 12:29.250
My dad owns a bait shop there,
right on the pier.

12:29.250 --> 12:30.880
I promised him he could meet
Austin Briggs

12:30.880 --> 12:32.830
and see the Regatta trophy.

12:32.830 --> 12:37.250
Well, I do appreciate
your respect for your dad.

12:37.250 --> 12:39.880
And I suppose you're not
completely to blame.

12:39.880 --> 12:42.170
Truth is,
I was rude to you too.

12:42.170 --> 12:43.920
-No.
-Yes, I was.

12:43.920 --> 12:45.750
Come on, you can admit it.

12:45.750 --> 12:49.080
Okay, but only because
it's rude to disagree.

12:49.080 --> 12:50.210
You know what?

12:50.210 --> 12:52.170
Because that trophy
means so much to your dad,

12:52.170 --> 12:53.920
why don't you have him
come down here.

12:53.920 --> 12:55.380
Really?

12:55.380 --> 12:57.710
You can join me as my guests.

12:57.710 --> 12:59.880
That'd be amazing!
Thank you.

12:59.880 --> 13:01.880
I'll go get him.

13:01.880 --> 13:03.710
Wait, this isn't a setup

13:03.710 --> 13:06.120
so you can not
let us in later, right?

13:06.120 --> 13:08.290
Forget I said that.

13:11.040 --> 13:13.830
Miles of sandy beach
right around the corner,

13:13.830 --> 13:16.750
and this is where the boys' map
said the treasure is buried.

13:16.750 --> 13:18.710
Add my vacation
to the list of things

13:18.710 --> 13:20.880
that the pirates have stolen.

13:20.880 --> 13:22.420
Well, Flat Rachel's
still smiling.

13:22.420 --> 13:24.210
Look happy, I might catch you
in the background.

13:26.790 --> 13:29.500
This doesn't say
where the treasure's buried.

13:29.500 --> 13:31.040
We're gonna have
to dig up everything.

13:31.040 --> 13:32.500
Maybe the parking lot too.

13:32.500 --> 13:35.000
We should've spent
less time on costumes

13:35.000 --> 13:37.040
and more time
on equipment.

13:39.120 --> 13:40.830
Another penny?

13:40.830 --> 13:43.580
Ground, I told you,
nothing less than a quarter.

13:46.000 --> 13:47.710
Can we borrow that machine?

13:47.710 --> 13:49.290
We'd like to conduct
some experiments

13:49.290 --> 13:50.500
with magnetic fields.

13:50.500 --> 13:51.790
Drop the act.

13:51.790 --> 13:53.750
You need this to find
your treasure...

13:53.750 --> 13:55.710
and I'm in.

13:55.710 --> 13:58.170
All I've got so far
is four cents and a retainer.

13:58.170 --> 13:59.460
Let me see that.

14:01.040 --> 14:04.750
This says all pirate ships
crashed on the rocks.

14:04.750 --> 14:08.210
If there's any treasure,
it's fallen in the water.

14:08.210 --> 14:09.750
We'd need a boat
for that.

14:09.750 --> 14:11.960
And we're not old enough
to rent one.

14:11.960 --> 14:14.500
So we just have to stay here
six more years.

14:15.540 --> 14:17.500
That's one idea.

14:17.500 --> 14:19.040
Let's keep thinking.

14:24.250 --> 14:26.540
Help yourself
to anything you like.

14:26.540 --> 14:29.330
Food, drink, the marble statue
in the corner.

14:30.750 --> 14:33.000
I kid. Don't touch
the marble statue.

14:33.000 --> 14:35.290
The guard will get
very angry.

14:35.290 --> 14:38.170
This is unexpected.
I thought you hated us.

14:38.170 --> 14:39.540
Oh, "hate's" a strong word.

14:39.540 --> 14:41.290
Although I did hold
a bit of a grudge

14:41.290 --> 14:44.080
after your family beat mine
in the Aqualympics.

14:44.080 --> 14:45.710
That's okay.
We held a grudge too,

14:45.710 --> 14:46.960
and we didn't even lose.

14:49.960 --> 14:53.170
Au... Au...

14:53.170 --> 14:56.210
That's Dad freakout language
for "Austin Briggs."

14:56.210 --> 14:57.880
Take a breath.
Quick back check.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.290
Uh-oh.

15:02.290 --> 15:04.580
Don't worry, I'm part owner of
the boat that won that trophy.

15:04.580 --> 15:06.710
Oh, wow.

15:06.710 --> 15:08.170
That is significant.

15:09.380 --> 15:11.250
Maybe just don't go in
for a hug.

15:11.250 --> 15:12.250
Go.

15:15.710 --> 15:18.290
I hear you're a haddock man.

15:18.290 --> 15:19.960
He could have really used
my Dry Thru.

15:19.960 --> 15:22.040
Ah, yes, the doohickey
from the water park

15:22.040 --> 15:24.080
that dries your feet
or something?

15:24.080 --> 15:26.210
It was like a giant hand-dryer,
but for your whole body.

15:28.170 --> 15:30.210
Oh, I've got to get a picture
with the seafood tower.

15:30.210 --> 15:32.750
My family is never
going to believe this.

15:32.750 --> 15:35.670
Well, seeing is believing.
Invite them down.

15:35.670 --> 15:39.710
You do remember how many of us
there are, right?

15:40.830 --> 15:42.960
For favorite holiday,

15:42.960 --> 15:45.960
spring break just kicked
Christmas' butt.

15:45.960 --> 15:48.250
Prime rib station,
waffle station,

15:48.250 --> 15:50.290
pasta station.

15:50.290 --> 15:52.460
What I really need
is an elastic pants station.

15:53.790 --> 15:55.460
There was a turkey leg
station?

15:55.460 --> 15:57.040
How did I miss that?

15:57.040 --> 15:59.040
Want a bite, Flat Rachel?

15:59.040 --> 16:00.580
What's that?

16:00.580 --> 16:03.290
You want to take
a boat ride?

16:03.290 --> 16:06.170
Flat Rachel says she wants
to row a boat around the harbor.

16:06.170 --> 16:08.500
Oh, great idea.

16:08.500 --> 16:10.040
She would look cute
on a rowboat.

16:10.040 --> 16:11.540
Plus, I owe her one.

16:11.540 --> 16:13.040
I dropped her
in the fondue.

16:19.290 --> 16:21.500
Tomorrow, that treasure is ours.

16:21.500 --> 16:23.040
And that's how it's done.

16:25.170 --> 16:27.670
For the record,
she had four cents

16:27.670 --> 16:30.080
and a retainer
before she teamed with us.

16:31.420 --> 16:33.500
Another win for the Diaz family.

16:33.500 --> 16:36.080
Who knew a spring break
like this was possible?

16:36.080 --> 16:38.170
We went from polishing
the bait tanks

16:38.170 --> 16:41.080
to polishing off
an entire cupcake tower.

16:41.080 --> 16:44.120
Gather the other kids.
Family meeting.

16:44.120 --> 16:46.920
Wait, this isn't like
the water park.

16:46.920 --> 16:49.420
We don't have to pay
for all this, do we?

16:49.420 --> 16:50.670
No.

16:52.120 --> 16:54.040
we're selling
the Bait & Bite.

16:54.040 --> 16:56.500
What?

16:56.500 --> 16:59.460
But it's been in our family
longer than most of us.

16:59.460 --> 17:02.120
Selling our family business?

17:02.120 --> 17:04.790
When I said I wanted a break
from the Bait & Bite,

17:04.790 --> 17:06.290
I didn't mean forever.

17:11.000 --> 17:13.460
Mr. Pillman made us
a very generous offer.

17:13.460 --> 17:15.040
I thought you guys
would be happy.

17:15.040 --> 17:16.460
The only reason
we're on this trip

17:16.460 --> 17:18.330
is because you guys wanted
to get away from that place.

17:18.330 --> 17:20.620
Yeah, you're always complaining
about stocking the shelves,

17:20.620 --> 17:22.380
or counting
the inventory.

17:22.380 --> 17:24.120
Chasing runaway
sea slugs.

17:24.120 --> 17:26.120
Dragging out anchors
for the annual sale.

17:26.120 --> 17:27.960
Dragging them back
when no one buys one.

17:27.960 --> 17:29.620
So now you'll never
have to do any of that,

17:29.620 --> 17:32.420
or spend another
spring break cleaning.

17:32.420 --> 17:34.540
It is our least favorite week
of the year.

17:34.540 --> 17:36.580
And this has been
our most favorite.

17:36.580 --> 17:39.040
And I didn't think
anything could top

17:39.040 --> 17:41.580
that week we went
pants-free.

17:41.580 --> 17:44.500
I know the Bait & Bite pays
for everything in our lives,

17:44.500 --> 17:47.420
but it also keeps us
from having a lot of fun.

17:47.420 --> 17:49.710
Well, maybe now I'll have
an opportunity

17:49.710 --> 17:52.000
to start a business
that you'll all like better.

17:52.000 --> 17:53.580
But I already have a business
I really like.

17:53.580 --> 17:55.540
My Slushy Shack.

17:55.540 --> 17:58.500
Mr. Pillman said you can
continue to run it rent-free

17:58.500 --> 18:00.460
as long as there's
a Bait & Bite.

18:00.460 --> 18:02.620
So you're saying I can keep
the one thing I like

18:02.620 --> 18:05.580
and get rid of everything
I don't?

18:05.580 --> 18:06.880
I'm in.

18:06.880 --> 18:09.960
Raise your hand if you want more
fun and less work.

18:14.540 --> 18:16.000
Yeah, I'm sorry
this is so rushed.

18:16.000 --> 18:17.420
We delivered the boat
this morning.

18:17.420 --> 18:18.880
-Have to go home.
-No worries.

18:18.880 --> 18:20.670
I have to take the trophy
to the next club.

18:20.670 --> 18:22.620
I'm only a quarter owner
of the boat that won.

18:22.620 --> 18:24.460
This puppy's got to make
the rounds.

18:27.750 --> 18:29.540
I'll call you from Marshport.

18:29.540 --> 18:31.710
Or Maui. Depends on how quick
we get the money.

18:31.710 --> 18:34.080
Money from the boat,
money from the sale.

18:34.080 --> 18:36.460
Could the Diazes
make more money today?

18:36.460 --> 18:38.080
I never would have thought
I'd get a picture

18:38.080 --> 18:40.040
of Flat Rachel
in a rowboat.

18:40.040 --> 18:41.670
Thanks for the suggestion,
you guys.

18:41.670 --> 18:44.120
We consider every memory
a treasure.

18:44.120 --> 18:46.670
We also consider treasure
a treasure.

18:46.670 --> 18:49.460
So when this thing goes on,
watch your earrings.

18:54.460 --> 18:56.420
Flat Rachel!

18:56.420 --> 18:57.420
No!

18:59.040 --> 19:01.620
-The regulator!

19:05.460 --> 19:07.830
My trophy!

19:07.830 --> 19:10.540
My trophy!

19:15.620 --> 19:17.000
Aah!

19:23.670 --> 19:26.120
Oh, this whole family
is a nightmare!

19:26.120 --> 19:28.040
We are so, so sorry.

19:28.040 --> 19:29.500
Sorry?

19:29.500 --> 19:32.540
Sorry is what you'll be
when I tear down your store.

19:32.540 --> 19:36.580
Wait, you're going to tear down
the Bait & Bite?

19:36.580 --> 19:39.420
Well, not personally.
I'll hire people.

19:39.420 --> 19:41.670
You know, the only reason
I bought it

19:41.670 --> 19:43.580
was so that I could build
a yacht club.

19:43.580 --> 19:46.420
I've been looking to build
in New England for years.

19:46.420 --> 19:48.540
You have no idea what a waste
of real estate

19:48.540 --> 19:50.750
that little worm shack is.

19:50.750 --> 19:52.750
But you said I could
run my Slushy--

19:52.750 --> 19:54.750
As long as it still stands.

19:54.750 --> 19:56.830
Which will be about a week.

19:56.830 --> 19:58.960
Better get home
and get packing.

20:12.120 --> 20:13.670
This is my fault.

20:13.670 --> 20:15.540
If I hadn't convinced you guys
to take that trip,

20:15.540 --> 20:16.880
none of this
would have happened.

20:16.880 --> 20:20.460
I can't believe it.
There's so many memories here.

20:57.750 --> 21:00.080
I guess some things are more
important than money.

21:01.380 --> 21:03.960
This must be
a difficult time.

21:03.960 --> 21:05.960
Lucky for me,
I don't care.

21:05.960 --> 21:08.960
We have a few hours before
this becomes your property.

21:08.960 --> 21:10.460
Enjoy your final moments.

21:10.460 --> 21:12.040
I'm just showing
my lawyer the place

21:12.040 --> 21:15.000
so that we can order
the appropriate size bulldozer.

21:16.500 --> 21:18.460
I'd like to bulldoze him.

21:18.460 --> 21:20.040
Normally, I'd tell you
not to talk like that,

21:20.040 --> 21:23.580
but it's way nicer
than what I was going to say.

21:23.580 --> 21:26.460
Turns out Hannah's
not so nice either.

21:26.460 --> 21:28.620
Who's this dude?
She's already moved on from me.

21:28.620 --> 21:31.670
"Moved on" implies
she stopped in the first place.

21:33.670 --> 21:35.460
Go back.

21:35.460 --> 21:37.420
Oh, yeah,
that's a good one.

21:37.420 --> 21:39.580
She looks so adorable
with that reindeer filter.

21:39.580 --> 21:41.540
Forget the antlers.
Look in the background.

21:42.920 --> 21:46.500
"Invisi-Towel,
by Pillman Industries"?

21:46.500 --> 21:48.790
That's my Dry-Thru.

21:48.790 --> 21:51.000
Mr. Pillman
stole my invention.

21:52.040 --> 21:53.040
Excuse me?

21:53.040 --> 21:54.750
You stole my invention

21:54.750 --> 21:56.790
and called it something else
that isn't even clever.

21:56.790 --> 21:58.710
What if I did

21:58.710 --> 22:00.000
What are you going to do,
take me to court?

22:00.000 --> 22:02.040
I will, and it will be
an open-and-shut case.

22:02.040 --> 22:05.790
Really? A teenager versus
an established businessman?

22:05.790 --> 22:07.830
No, it's an established
businessman

22:07.830 --> 22:10.000
versus a teenager
with a patent.

22:11.080 --> 22:12.500
A patent?

22:12.500 --> 22:14.500
A legal document
that proves I invented something

22:14.500 --> 22:16.420
and prevents other people
from stealing it.

22:16.420 --> 22:17.620
I know what a patent is!

22:17.620 --> 22:19.710
It's expensive
and complicated to get.

22:19.710 --> 22:21.000
How do you have one?

22:21.000 --> 22:23.080
When I won the invention contest
at the water park,

22:23.080 --> 22:24.960
it was part of the prize.

22:24.960 --> 22:26.000
Thank you, fine print.

22:26.000 --> 22:31.330
Looks like you'll be seeing us
in court.

22:33.830 --> 22:36.960
Unless you want
to settle this here.

22:36.960 --> 22:40.460
You tear up the sale contract
for the Bait & Bite right now,

22:40.460 --> 22:41.750
and I don't sue.

22:56.670 --> 22:58.040
Welcome to the Bait & Bite.

22:58.040 --> 23:01.420
Can I show you anything,
like the door?

23:14.500 --> 23:17.540
Look like we did some
spring cleaning after all.

23:17.540 --> 23:19.750
You know who would have
really appreciated this?

23:19.750 --> 23:22.750
Flat Rachel...
wherever she is.

23:29.580 --> 23:32.540
There's nothing more important
in life than family.

23:32.540 --> 23:35.960
And it turns out,
family isn't always people.

23:35.960 --> 23:38.580
It's also the place
you spend your time,

23:38.580 --> 23:43.580
make your memories,
chase your dreams.

23:43.580 --> 23:44.880
It may bug you sometimes,

23:44.880 --> 23:47.000
you may have your ups
and downs,

23:47.000 --> 23:49.960
but your life wouldn't
be the same without it.
