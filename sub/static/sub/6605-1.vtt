03:41.500 --> 03:42.499
7:15!

03:43.940 --> 03:45.459
During the class action suit

03:45.660 --> 03:49.419
against the mother company of Serenity,
the ship that sank off the Belgium coast.

03:50.381 --> 03:53.500
The families seeking damages for
the loss of loved ones met a roadblock.

03:53.701 --> 03:56.660
One of those families,
The Pieters, were not...

04:02.941 --> 04:04.220
Why are you going through my stuff?

04:05.061 --> 04:08.461
When I was a kid, and that was a 100
years ago and you'll never be my age,

04:09.442 --> 04:11.261
but, we actually...

04:12.182 --> 04:14.981
got the report card and took it home
to our parents so they could see it.

04:15.782 --> 04:17.901
Mom never went through my stuff.

04:18.661 --> 04:21.021
- Well, I mean, I'm not mom.
- Yeah, no shit!

04:21.702 --> 04:22.352
Hey!

04:23.182 --> 04:24.781
I can't find my filters.

04:25.182 --> 04:27.102
Well, if you were a filter,
where would you be?

04:27.543 --> 04:28.942
I don't even know what that means.

04:29.783 --> 04:31.382
If I were a filter...

04:33.423 --> 04:36.222
I would be in the cabinet,
on the second shelf.

04:39.823 --> 04:42.542
I'm not having you flunk
this semester, young lady!

04:43.864 --> 04:45.303
Is that milk in it?

04:46.944 --> 04:49.343
Dad, milk enzymes cause food allergies.

04:49.984 --> 04:51.343
Mom always used soy.

04:51.544 --> 04:53.983
You'd rather drink a
genetically modified bean?

04:55.824 --> 04:56.943
Right.

04:57.744 --> 05:01.424
- Did you get these kind of grades in the States?
- No.

05:04.625 --> 05:07.224
Amy, if we're gonna make this work,
we both have to try.

05:08.625 --> 05:09.824
That's Sadie, I gotta go.

05:10.505 --> 05:13.184
It's my awards time already tonight.
Can't forget.

05:18.866 --> 05:20.505
Alright. Don't be late, okay?

05:20.706 --> 05:22.465
Alright, and then we'll gonna
talk about this report card.

05:24.506 --> 05:25.305
What?

05:25.666 --> 05:27.345
You're not gonna kiss me goodbye?

05:29.306 --> 05:30.705
Sure, of course I was,
I was going to.

05:54.548 --> 05:55.587
Bonjour, Walter.

06:01.148 --> 06:03.667
- I got you two sugars this time.
- Thanks, Mr. Logan!

06:13.709 --> 06:16.908
I thought Halgate owned the
security devices we're testing.

06:17.509 --> 06:18.988
I need you to look at this.

06:20.189 --> 06:22.188
You read the number? Now, look.

06:24.669 --> 06:28.048
I checked the patent for the iris scanner to see
if the original schematic reveal any weaknesses.

06:28.149 --> 06:29.949
You know what I found?

06:31.070 --> 06:34.749
- Somebody made a mistake, we don't own the patent.
- No, how can that be?

06:35.270 --> 06:38.309
We must own these devices.
Check the other patents, okay?

06:47.071 --> 06:48.270
Let's go.

06:49.271 --> 06:52.510
You asked us to review our
security devices for flaws, so...

06:53.031 --> 06:56.550
if you don't have the pass code
and wanna smash your way in...

06:58.431 --> 07:01.430
our smart locks burn into
a hard polymer sealant here,

07:01.591 --> 07:03.790
that permanently secures the lock.
Okay?

07:04.151 --> 07:08.391
We couldn't hack the pass codes, these algorithms
were some of the most secure we've encountered.

07:08.552 --> 07:09.991
But, we found

07:10.192 --> 07:11.791
that if you first inject...

07:11.992 --> 07:13.991
it's just a mix of
ordinary household bleach

07:14.192 --> 07:16.671
and sulfur compound
in the mechanism...

07:19.112 --> 07:19.991
Oh, see, I'm sorry, Derek.

07:20.872 --> 07:22.392
Please, go ahead.

07:23.073 --> 07:24.472
The lock becomes useless,

07:24.673 --> 07:26.432
so we have to find
a solution that isn't

07:26.593 --> 07:29.392
compromised by ordinary household bleach.

07:30.953 --> 07:31.752
Next.

07:31.953 --> 07:33.032
Mr. Kohler? If you please...

07:33.553 --> 07:35.192
The last system.

07:35.393 --> 07:37.272
Halgate biometric scanner, model H1P,

07:37.713 --> 07:41.313
providing level 3 security to U.S.
military facilities in mainland Europe.

07:41.994 --> 07:45.393
Now, we tried a variety of
attacks to break in, and...

07:46.034 --> 07:49.553
this one was tough, but one proved successful.
We have a montage...

07:50.794 --> 07:53.673
of 50 specific irises
in a specific group pattern.

07:58.875 --> 08:01.234
And you're in!
Just brute force.

08:02.675 --> 08:05.034
Excellent, Ben. As always.

08:05.275 --> 08:06.914
Let's fix these flaws quickly, and...

08:07.075 --> 08:09.274
please send me the video
along with your report.

08:09.435 --> 08:11.514
I'll make sure our people get on this also.

08:11.915 --> 08:13.114
Thank you.

08:13.875 --> 08:14.916
Derek, you got a second?

08:15.016 --> 08:15.866
Yeah, sure, Ben.

08:16.436 --> 08:20.555
I think there's something you should know.
Somebody forgot to file patents on these products.

08:20.996 --> 08:22.395
Patents? How do you know?

08:22.836 --> 08:26.155
Well, we pulled the original schematics to
see if we could spot any weaknesses, and...

08:27.076 --> 08:30.915
Personnel all over the world rely on
the fact that our equipment is secure,

08:31.076 --> 08:34.236
- and that security is compromised with somebody...
- I know what it means, Ben.

08:34.636 --> 08:37.556
- How bad is it?
- Well, we got people looking into it.

08:37.817 --> 08:38.717
Okay, well...

08:38.996 --> 08:42.996
Keep on it, keep me informed.
Keep it between us.

08:43.157 --> 08:45.996
I look forward to your full
presentation report tonight.

08:46.437 --> 08:48.236
Tonight? Derek, my daughter...

08:48.397 --> 08:51.077
Please, Ben, please.

08:53.598 --> 08:55.157
What time the next batch get in here?

08:56.878 --> 08:59.717
8 a.m.
No, that's fine, I'll be here.

09:07.999 --> 09:10.318
- Hey, Floyd!
- Are you okay to lock up?

09:11.479 --> 09:12.878
- Walter's gonna do it.
- Okay.

09:13.439 --> 09:15.798
It's eight!
Mr. Logan, you should go home.

09:16.599 --> 09:17.478
Oh, shit.

09:18.479 --> 09:19.838
Hey, Mr. Logan!

09:20.919 --> 09:22.558
- Anderlecht win?
- No.

09:22.759 --> 09:23.998
They're losing again!

09:24.359 --> 09:26.999
- Courier's picking that up for head office in an hour.
- Okay.

09:52.481 --> 09:53.640
Well done, Rosie!

09:55.401 --> 09:58.000
Okay now, the first prize!

09:58.281 --> 10:03.161
A check for 250 euros
for best photo essay.

10:03.922 --> 10:06.681
Amy Logan, "Homeland".

10:21.763 --> 10:24.042
- Oh, hi, Mr. Logan.
- Hi, Sadie.

10:24.323 --> 10:25.882
- Amy won!
- She won?

10:26.043 --> 10:27.442
Yeah, she won first prize!

10:28.603 --> 10:30.042
Where is she? Is she up there?

10:30.203 --> 10:31.802
She's with some friends.

10:34.243 --> 10:35.282
Wait!

10:53.004 --> 10:53.804
Amy!

10:55.425 --> 10:55.925
Hey!

10:57.965 --> 10:59.204
Hey, I gotta go.

10:59.365 --> 11:00.924
- What?
- I gotta go.

11:02.285 --> 11:03.684
- See you.
- See you later.

11:12.286 --> 11:13.965
Put your seat belt on.

11:17.086 --> 11:18.365
Who was that?

11:18.846 --> 11:19.965
Nabil.

11:20.366 --> 11:21.645
He's helping me.

11:21.806 --> 11:24.605
- Yeah, helping you with what?
- "Without Voices."

11:24.806 --> 11:26.485
It's my next photo essay.

11:26.686 --> 11:29.926
You know, people making life here because we
screwed up whatever country they're from.

11:31.007 --> 11:33.326
Don't get caught up on
other people's problems.

11:33.807 --> 11:36.166
Boy, what a world this would be
if everyone thought like you!

11:36.367 --> 11:39.686
- And you shouldn't be hanging out there.
- And you should show up when you say you will.

11:44.327 --> 11:46.046
Do you have anything to eat?

11:46.888 --> 11:48.247
You know what?

11:48.408 --> 11:50.967
Mei Ling brought you cookies.

11:51.728 --> 11:55.487
- I thought I don't eat sweets.
- It's all I've got.

11:57.168 --> 11:58.967
I got the phone bill today.

11:59.848 --> 12:01.767
300 euros of calls to your Grandfather?

12:02.248 --> 12:04.088
Has this got peanuts in it?

12:05.409 --> 12:06.808
I don't feel so good, dad.

12:07.449 --> 12:09.088
- You okay?
- No.

12:09.329 --> 12:09.979
No!

12:11.049 --> 12:11.888
Okay, hold on.

12:25.890 --> 12:27.329
You can see her.

12:31.570 --> 12:33.769
Doc says you're gonna live.

12:36.570 --> 12:39.490
- Told you I had a peanut allergy.
- I'm sorry.

12:40.091 --> 12:41.810
I should have asked.

12:45.011 --> 12:47.570
We have to go to the office
and pick up a delivery.

12:48.571 --> 12:49.930
Won't be long.

12:52.451 --> 12:55.050
Did I tell you I found a place
we can watch baseball?

12:55.451 --> 12:57.371
In Ghent. Expat community.

12:58.812 --> 13:00.731
Thought we could go there, hang out.
Fun.

13:01.812 --> 13:03.051
I hate baseball.

13:07.052 --> 13:09.731
When your mom and I first met,
we used to go to games all the time.

13:10.492 --> 13:12.691
Yeah, if it was so great,
then why'd you leave?

13:22.333 --> 13:23.133
Bonjour, Walter.

13:27.333 --> 13:27.933
Bonjour!

13:35.534 --> 13:36.234
Walter?

13:49.694 --> 13:50.854
Dad?

13:51.655 --> 13:54.174
Are we on the right floor?
Come here!

14:39.377 --> 14:40.736
Who are you calling?

14:41.737 --> 14:42.737
Our office number here.

14:51.258 --> 14:52.057
Shit.

15:37.341 --> 15:38.660
What's going on?

15:41.181 --> 15:43.820
Some kind of misunderstanding.
Come on.

15:45.901 --> 15:48.380
Dad, your company can't
just pick up and leave.

15:50.301 --> 15:52.980
Okay, if you were a company,
where would you hide?

15:53.141 --> 15:54.301
Don't start.

15:55.702 --> 15:57.221
We're going to Brussels.

15:58.182 --> 15:59.301
What?

16:00.102 --> 16:02.461
An hour to get there,
an hour to clear this up,

16:02.622 --> 16:04.461
we'll be back by lunch.

16:04.622 --> 16:05.981
Dad, I have school.

16:06.822 --> 16:08.461
You just got the day off.

16:21.663 --> 16:25.222
The Halgate group:
A world-wide enterprise bringing the latest

16:25.423 --> 16:29.503
technological advances to shipping,
construction and engineering.

16:30.444 --> 16:31.244
- Bonjour.
- Bonjour.

16:31.664 --> 16:33.463
- I'm here to see Derek Kohler, please.
- One moment, please.

16:33.624 --> 16:34.983
Thank you.

16:36.184 --> 16:37.463
No pictures, young lady.

16:39.264 --> 16:40.543
Sorry.

16:42.984 --> 16:45.463
The database is not showing
a Derek Kohler, sir.

16:45.704 --> 16:48.064
- That's impossible.
- Is there another name you want me to try?

16:48.265 --> 16:52.004
Yes, please try again.
It's K-O-L-H-E-R.

16:52.065 --> 16:53.944
- Excuse me!
- It's very important, please, just...

16:54.145 --> 16:56.004
- I know he's in the database.
- Excuse me!

16:56.025 --> 16:56.645
Try it again, will you?

16:56.705 --> 16:57.984
Security!

16:59.265 --> 17:01.144
I don't know how to say this, Mr. Logan.

17:01.425 --> 17:06.425
But you do not, nor have you ever worked
for a subsidiary of this company.

17:06.945 --> 17:08.065
We don't even make this kind

17:08.266 --> 17:10.905
of security systems.
And we never employed a...

17:11.826 --> 17:12.944
a Derek Kohler.

17:13.306 --> 17:14.185
Listen to me.

17:15.266 --> 17:18.785
A New York based company called "Placement
Solutions" came to me three months ago,

17:18.945 --> 17:22.106
said they wanted to open a new
division of The Halgate Group in Europe,

17:22.267 --> 17:24.826
as part of their - your -
private security business.

17:24.987 --> 17:29.106
Mr. Logan, you are in the European
headquarters of The Halgate Group.

17:30.067 --> 17:32.746
We handle all our
recruitment direct.

17:34.467 --> 17:35.866
I need your battery.

17:36.387 --> 17:37.826
Mine's dead.

17:38.027 --> 17:39.547
I wanna show you my e-mail.

17:41.188 --> 17:42.027
Thank you.

17:56.588 --> 17:59.828
It's my business correspondence.
It's eight weeks in work.

18:03.789 --> 18:06.868
- Your business correspondence?
- That's right.

18:08.949 --> 18:11.988
Your BlackBerry is empty.

18:16.710 --> 18:19.149
We've run a background
check on you, Mr. Logan.

18:19.630 --> 18:22.669
Seems you've been living in
Antwerp now, eight weeks,

18:22.870 --> 18:24.389
as you say.

18:24.830 --> 18:28.789
But your last registered
address was New York,

18:28.950 --> 18:30.309
14 years ago.

18:31.070 --> 18:34.470
Before that, Washington D.C. 1989.

18:34.631 --> 18:35.630
Since then,

18:35.951 --> 18:38.390
no records of any kind exist for you.

18:39.111 --> 18:42.030
You've been working for a Halgate
subsidiary which doesn't exist.

18:42.191 --> 18:43.251
Testing products we don't make.

18:43.451 --> 18:45.810
Reporting to an officer
we have never employed.

18:45.871 --> 18:47.710
I've received paychecks from you.

18:49.031 --> 18:52.711
I have received pension,
medical insurance, car insurance.

18:52.952 --> 18:53.752
Mr. Logan...

18:54.272 --> 18:55.631
If you were in my shoes,

18:55.912 --> 18:57.911
listening to your story,

18:59.312 --> 19:00.711
what would you do?

19:10.833 --> 19:14.072
There must be some sort of mistake. My
salary payments, they should be listed here.

19:14.513 --> 19:17.592
I'm afraid that this is all we have,
this is all there is.

19:18.233 --> 19:21.112
There is no activity in your account

19:21.313 --> 19:22.832
since you opened it.

19:37.874 --> 19:39.633
- Mr. Logan.
- Floyd!

19:40.074 --> 19:42.393
- Am I glad to see you!
- What are you doing here?

19:42.915 --> 19:44.954
The company. Everything is gone!
What's going on?

19:45.115 --> 19:49.474
I don't know. My e-mails, bank statements,
my records, everything's gone.

19:50.235 --> 19:52.074
Don't make a sound.
No sudden moves.

19:52.275 --> 19:53.394
Hey, can you cash my...

19:55.795 --> 19:56.994
check?

20:00.876 --> 20:03.835
- Why are you doing this, Floyd?
- Get on the autoroute.

20:13.076 --> 20:13.955
Where are we going?

20:14.516 --> 20:15.915
Hands on the wheel.

20:17.837 --> 20:19.876
I'll do exactly as you say.

20:23.077 --> 20:24.796
Floyd, what happened to the company?

20:26.317 --> 20:27.756
Talk to me, Floyd.

20:30.917 --> 20:32.676
Talk to me, damned.
Why are you doing this?

20:33.877 --> 20:35.076
Eyes on the road!

20:35.277 --> 20:36.717
- Don't hit him.
- Shut up!

20:37.438 --> 20:38.877
It's okay, baby.

20:39.718 --> 20:40.557
Just sit back.

20:45.458 --> 20:46.538
Amy?

20:47.438 --> 20:48.837
I thought I told you to always
put your your seatbelt on.

20:51.438 --> 20:53.118
Take the third exit.

20:54.279 --> 20:55.518
What are you gonna do?

20:56.079 --> 20:57.398
Who are you working for?

20:59.559 --> 21:01.798
You should have taken my advice, Ben.

21:02.519 --> 21:04.638
I told you to go home.

21:05.359 --> 21:08.198
Now they made me come looking for you.
For both of you.

21:08.879 --> 21:10.278
Take this exit.

21:10.920 --> 21:12.599
Take this exit out! Take it!

21:13.600 --> 21:14.639
It's okay, Amy.

21:19.560 --> 21:20.719
- Slow down!
- Dad, slow down!

21:22.200 --> 21:22.860
Slow down!

21:25.460 --> 21:27.199
Slow down!

21:44.161 --> 21:44.960
Dad, watch out!

21:46.202 --> 21:47.001
Dad!

21:58.082 --> 22:00.241
Dad, the wheel!

22:35.724 --> 22:36.563
Dad!

22:55.245 --> 22:56.605
Who you're working for, Floyd?

22:58.686 --> 23:00.365
I want answers, Floyd.

23:01.286 --> 23:03.365
What was waiting for me at home?

23:04.966 --> 23:07.845
Who you're working for?
Who you're working for?

23:21.927 --> 23:23.046
Oh, my God!

23:35.688 --> 23:37.167
Dad, the cops, they can help us.

23:37.528 --> 23:38.727
- They can't help us.
- Yes, they can!

23:39.168 --> 23:40.247
No, they can't.

23:55.049 --> 23:56.088
Come on.

24:04.249 --> 24:05.048
Get back!

24:29.691 --> 24:30.490
Stay back.

24:49.132 --> 24:50.371
Hey, come here, you hurt?
We can't...

24:50.572 --> 24:53.211
We can't be here, dad,
this is someone's house!

24:53.412 --> 24:54.731
We won't be here long.

24:54.932 --> 24:56.011
Draw the curtains.

25:12.133 --> 25:13.172
You killed him.

25:14.293 --> 25:15.612
In self-defense, Amy.

25:16.093 --> 25:17.813
No, Dad, this is messed up.

25:18.534 --> 25:19.653
This is so messed up!

25:19.814 --> 25:21.373
I need you to help me right now, okay?

25:23.054 --> 25:25.533
Over the top, around the thumb.

25:26.214 --> 25:28.493
We could still go to the police, dad.
They can help us.

25:29.894 --> 25:32.253
We should've been at home last night.

25:32.414 --> 25:34.213
He wanted us to go home.

25:34.374 --> 25:35.534
What's that?

25:36.135 --> 25:37.494
Looks like a locker key.

25:37.935 --> 25:38.894
"A.C."

25:39.695 --> 25:40.774
"Antwerp Central."

25:41.055 --> 25:43.534
You used to work for The State Department.
Why don't you call someone?

25:43.735 --> 25:46.334
And tell 'em what?
Someone erased my e-mails,

25:47.495 --> 25:49.814
bank records, my life?

25:57.676 --> 25:58.376
Amy!

25:58.936 --> 26:01.255
Why would someone you
work with try to kill us?

26:03.296 --> 26:05.855
Amy, listen to me.
I don't know what's going on here.

26:06.936 --> 26:08.455
Come here.

26:09.336 --> 26:11.816
The safest place for you
to be, right now,

26:11.977 --> 26:15.656
is at my side listening
to what I tell you.

26:15.817 --> 26:17.216
Will you do that for me?

26:19.337 --> 26:21.216
Will you trust me?

27:14.980 --> 27:16.179
Get back.

27:17.500 --> 27:19.059
You see those cameras up there?

27:20.901 --> 27:22.620
You keep your head down.

27:23.101 --> 27:26.180
They can't identify you if
they can't get a full profile.

27:28.301 --> 27:31.140
I'm going to the lockers.
Wait for me here.

27:31.581 --> 27:33.780
- Corners are safe.
- Dad?

27:33.941 --> 27:36.260
I'm not gonna let anything happen to you.

29:55.109 --> 29:58.148
- Where did you get that?
- From Floyd's locker.

29:59.109 --> 29:59.949
Mei Ling.

30:05.630 --> 30:06.989
Who are they?

30:08.470 --> 30:09.949
People I work with.

30:15.950 --> 30:17.230
That's my picture.

30:19.391 --> 30:21.870
That's a picture of Grandpa
and me in New Haven.

30:24.231 --> 30:25.990
How did this guy get this stuff?

30:26.511 --> 30:29.390
How can this guy have a picture
of me from four months ago?

30:32.391 --> 30:34.150
How can you be so calm?

30:34.311 --> 30:36.431
'Cause that's the only way we're
gonna figure out what's going on.

30:37.792 --> 30:39.391
Just let me work this out, okay?

30:43.792 --> 30:45.311
Hassan's.

30:46.672 --> 30:47.551
John's.

30:50.432 --> 30:52.311
This is Mei Ling's address.

30:52.873 --> 30:55.632
They all lived within
a five mile radius.

30:57.793 --> 30:59.872
What's the nearest hospital to here?

31:00.433 --> 31:02.672
- Where are we?
- Right here.

31:04.273 --> 31:06.032
St. Cornelius, right there.

31:06.193 --> 31:08.512
St. Cornelius, good job!

31:18.994 --> 31:22.073
Mei Ling Hom. Number 452.

31:22.674 --> 31:24.073
Who'd you say she was?

31:26.154 --> 31:27.513
I didn't.

31:35.995 --> 31:36.994
- You wait out here.
- No.

31:39.675 --> 31:41.674
This is a morgue, Amy.

31:42.315 --> 31:44.154
Now, my picture was in that file too.

31:44.355 --> 31:47.355
Are you coming or what?
You can't be seen out here!

31:53.716 --> 31:55.915
It was like a fire sale yesterday.

31:56.236 --> 31:59.035
Bunch of bodies, coming
in every other hour.

31:59.836 --> 32:01.995
She was found floating in the Scheldt.

32:05.277 --> 32:08.316
Blood alcohol level:
Five times the limit.

32:08.477 --> 32:11.636
No next of kin.
Still living in France.

32:12.117 --> 32:12.916
France?

32:13.717 --> 32:17.516
She was undocumented resident.
An illegal immigrant.

32:20.397 --> 32:22.157
You have 10 minutes.

32:30.398 --> 32:31.837
Jesus!

32:33.158 --> 32:34.917
Latent injuries.

32:40.119 --> 32:43.118
Electrocution, drowning,
heart attack on the metro.

32:47.119 --> 32:49.998
- Who are these people?
- My coworkers.

32:51.159 --> 32:52.918
Illegal immigrants.

33:07.560 --> 33:09.759
If we'd have gone home would
this have happened to us?

33:15.561 --> 33:17.200
Walter's not here.

33:23.321 --> 33:24.520
Hello, can I help you?

33:24.721 --> 33:26.600
Have you seen these people?

33:30.361 --> 33:31.601
You okay?

33:34.482 --> 33:35.721
I'm fine.

33:35.882 --> 33:37.481
Let's go, Amy.

33:40.762 --> 33:42.281
You okay?

33:42.442 --> 33:44.161
Let me take your bag.

33:46.402 --> 33:48.121
Amy, come here, talk to me.

33:49.123 --> 33:50.682
Get off me!

33:51.563 --> 33:53.282
You can kill a man with your bare hands.

33:53.443 --> 33:56.202
You can move through a crowded station
without the cops even knowing you're there.

33:56.363 --> 33:58.802
- You can speak like, Russian!
- Croatian.

33:58.963 --> 34:02.482
No, you can look at a bunch of photos, and
instinctively know where you'll find the bodies.

34:02.683 --> 34:04.453
- What father can do those things?
- Let me explain.

34:04.503 --> 34:05.682
No, explain this:

34:06.363 --> 34:08.963
You've been working for a company
that's only been employing immigrants,

34:09.123 --> 34:10.922
who are now dead!

34:11.994 --> 34:12.504
Amy...

34:12.884 --> 34:14.643
- Why did I even come here?
- Amy!

34:17.083 --> 34:18.882
Why did I even have to leave grandpa.

34:19.043 --> 34:22.203
You told me to trust you!
I don't even know who you are!

34:25.165 --> 34:25.964
Walter!

34:37.085 --> 34:37.884
Down!

34:56.606 --> 34:57.445
Come on!

36:41.132 --> 36:42.451
Dad!

36:46.613 --> 36:48.012
I'll get you out of here.

36:52.493 --> 36:53.452
Come on!

37:03.214 --> 37:05.533
- Let me see.
- Be careful!

37:06.614 --> 37:07.773
Dad, you've got a...

37:10.174 --> 37:11.493
It's just a flesh wound,
you'll be okay.

37:19.974 --> 37:20.774
Here.

37:24.095 --> 37:25.654
Go to the window.
Go to the window!

37:31.615 --> 37:33.254
Open! Police!

37:33.455 --> 37:35.134
Open the door!

37:54.336 --> 37:55.455
Get in.

38:13.378 --> 38:15.537
Here, take this.
Keep it pressed on your arm.

38:41.779 --> 38:42.778
You'll be all right.

38:55.020 --> 38:56.659
This is gonna sting a bit, okay.

38:58.700 --> 39:00.219
Hold my hand.

39:01.580 --> 39:03.459
Put your arm up here.

39:05.420 --> 39:08.620
You wanna know how I found the bodies?
Is that it?

39:16.141 --> 39:19.260
Floyd's locker was a safe drop.

39:19.541 --> 39:21.860
That file was a target hit list.

39:22.581 --> 39:25.341
And Floyd was a professional assassin.

39:25.942 --> 39:28.221
Following some sort of
government training protocol.

39:39.382 --> 39:41.141
Is that alright? Not too tight?

39:46.543 --> 39:47.862
What did mom tell you about me?

39:49.263 --> 39:52.702
That you were in Overseas Political Affairs
for The State Department.

39:56.143 --> 39:57.822
Your mother...

40:18.225 --> 40:20.224
I was working for the CIA.

40:28.305 --> 40:30.664
The communiques on the
Pan-African Council, Anna.

40:31.665 --> 40:34.104
Great, exactly what I needed.

40:34.626 --> 40:36.505
It's for the daily brief.

40:43.346 --> 40:46.145
Floyd Remi, former local operative,
killed on a roadside.

40:46.466 --> 40:47.905
Outside Brussels.

40:49.466 --> 40:51.985
Walter Smet, another former asset.

40:52.267 --> 40:56.266
Killed in a hospital in Antwerp
only a couple of hours ago.

40:57.387 --> 40:59.866
Ben Logan, one of
your operatives, Anna.

41:01.147 --> 41:03.546
We think he may have killed them both.

41:04.187 --> 41:07.026
- Ben was decommissioned six months ago.
- Decommissioned?

41:07.347 --> 41:10.067
- Why?
- He grown a conscience.

41:10.268 --> 41:12.187
Stopped following orders.

41:12.628 --> 41:15.827
The Oversight Committee decided
to make an example of him.

41:16.308 --> 41:20.067
- I put his report on your desk when it happened.
- Why wasn't he brought home?

41:20.428 --> 41:22.387
He wanted to go home.

41:22.588 --> 41:25.667
But the Committee punished him,
by making sure he'd never be able to.

41:26.348 --> 41:27.828
He can't ever return to the U.S.

41:28.029 --> 41:30.028
Has he tried to contact you?

41:32.629 --> 41:34.548
I haven't spoken to Ben
since we cut him loose.

41:35.389 --> 41:37.028
What's going on?

41:37.629 --> 41:39.948
This is our black vault in Brussels.

41:40.149 --> 41:43.188
We were using it as a repository
for sensitive documentation.

41:43.909 --> 41:46.149
It was burgled two nights ago,
by somebody who could break

41:46.310 --> 41:48.469
our most advanced security systems.

41:48.670 --> 41:51.149
That canister contained
top-secret documents

41:51.350 --> 41:53.989
we were collecting on behalf
of The Department Of Justice

41:54.190 --> 41:55.509
in conjunction with the
Belgian secret service.

41:55.710 --> 41:57.029
Collecting evidence for what?

41:57.790 --> 42:00.469
It relates to a class action
for negligence in Belgium

42:00.670 --> 42:02.830
against The Halgate Group.

42:03.351 --> 42:05.950
One of their merchant ships
sank six months ago.

42:06.431 --> 42:09.110
The families of the crewmen
want compensation.

42:09.431 --> 42:13.350
Halgate is willing to settle, but one family's
holding out and putting together their case.

42:13.551 --> 42:15.830
The investigators for the family's lawyers

42:16.151 --> 42:18.870
discovered something bigger
than a class action,

42:19.071 --> 42:20.351
something in the ship's manifest.

42:20.592 --> 42:22.551
Incriminating Halgate?

42:23.272 --> 42:27.031
On direct orders from the White House, this
is a top level classified investigation.

42:30.072 --> 42:32.071
What did you find?

42:32.592 --> 42:34.071
A smoking gun.

42:35.072 --> 42:36.991
That The Halgate Group was
shipping illegal arms

42:37.833 --> 42:40.952
to destabilize countries for
their own economic gain.

42:41.153 --> 42:44.352
Naturally, the White House thinks it
is our job to destabilize countries.

42:45.033 --> 42:46.672
Someone stole your smoking gun.

42:46.873 --> 42:49.392
Someone breached into the CIA.

42:50.913 --> 42:52.752
Halgate is a criminal.

42:53.033 --> 42:57.793
Without that evidence, the investigation
against The Halgate Group will collapse.

42:57.954 --> 42:59.353
Stakes are too high.

42:59.754 --> 43:02.873
The only thing we have to go on is
that Logan, a top security expert,

43:03.034 --> 43:05.433
was in Belgium at the time of the break-in.

43:05.674 --> 43:06.873
Can you find him?

43:08.634 --> 43:11.473
It's no secret you knew him intimately.

43:12.434 --> 43:13.794
I'll get on it.

43:25.515 --> 43:26.314
Derek?

43:26.515 --> 43:28.594
You said this wouldn't happen.

43:29.955 --> 43:31.875
What wouldn't happen?

43:32.116 --> 43:34.195
You said no one was gonna die.

43:34.956 --> 43:36.155
This was all wrong!

43:36.356 --> 43:39.435
- And that means what?
- It means they're all dead.

43:41.596 --> 43:44.395
The company, all the employees.

43:44.596 --> 43:47.635
And they're gonna kill me too.
You said this would end in pink slips.

43:47.956 --> 43:49.676
This wasn't pink slips!

43:49.877 --> 43:53.076
Nothing was supposed to go
down without my approval!

43:53.277 --> 43:54.716
They cut you out of the equation.

43:54.997 --> 43:56.636
Who gave the order?

43:56.877 --> 43:58.116
Braymer.

44:03.237 --> 44:04.356
Where is Logan?

44:08.598 --> 44:10.237
Derek, speak to me!

44:12.538 --> 44:13.138
Derek!

44:14.358 --> 44:15.677
Did you secure the cargo?

44:17.998 --> 44:22.197
Yeah, I have it. But now, this
is gonna play out on my terms.

44:29.119 --> 44:31.838
Tell the consulate in Brussels I'm
coming in and raise a local team.

44:32.039 --> 44:32.838
Now!

44:36.119 --> 44:38.118
Your mom and I were
trying to protect you.

44:38.319 --> 44:39.558
Yeah, from the truth.

44:43.320 --> 44:44.839
Did grandpa know?

44:45.280 --> 44:47.439
Yeah, he always knew.

44:48.400 --> 44:49.879
What exactly did you do for the CIA?

44:53.160 --> 44:57.279
I got people in and out of...

44:58.440 --> 45:00.280
difficult situations.

45:01.601 --> 45:03.920
I'm sorry we lied to you.

45:14.761 --> 45:16.641
Your mother took that photo.

45:16.802 --> 45:18.401
Yeah, she told me.

45:19.922 --> 45:22.001
She could see things I never could.

45:28.002 --> 45:29.881
I miss her too.

45:33.162 --> 45:36.442
- Why'd you quit your job?
- To be a father.

45:38.643 --> 45:40.842
I'm not doing too good
of a job of it, am I?

45:41.723 --> 45:45.282
- I wouldn't know.
- Oh, really?

45:46.443 --> 45:49.322
- We can't go back home, can we?
- No.

45:50.723 --> 45:52.483
We go back home...

45:53.324 --> 45:55.763
These people found us twice,
they'll find us again.

45:56.124 --> 45:57.323
Who are these people?

45:57.484 --> 46:00.563
I'm not sure.
I think I was being used.

46:01.164 --> 46:03.203
All I know, those products were real.

46:03.364 --> 46:06.243
And if Halgate wasn't making them,
then somebody else was.

46:07.044 --> 46:08.603
Somebody wanted them compromised.

46:10.525 --> 46:11.724
Look at this.

46:12.485 --> 46:14.644
That's a patent number.

46:14.745 --> 46:17.524
It's etched into some of the products.
We have to find out what's that all about.

46:17.685 --> 46:19.484
Then there's my place of work.

46:19.685 --> 46:21.484
Addresses have owners, clues.

46:22.005 --> 46:25.204
All we gotta do is figure out
where we're to stay tonight.

46:27.846 --> 46:29.605
Can I have some change?

46:44.606 --> 46:46.406
Nabil said he'd help.

46:46.447 --> 46:47.047
Yes?

46:48.727 --> 46:50.286
Come on.

47:02.928 --> 47:04.767
Karim, this is my dad.

47:05.008 --> 47:07.247
Dad, this is Nabil's brother, Karim.

47:07.848 --> 47:08.887
Hello, Karim.

47:09.088 --> 47:10.327
It's a pleasure.

47:10.808 --> 47:13.087
Nabil said you'd help.

47:14.848 --> 47:16.687
I said I'd think about it.

47:16.968 --> 47:18.967
You found us a place in Brussels?

47:19.688 --> 47:23.408
- I don't help criminals.
- That's good, 'cause we're not criminals.

47:24.449 --> 47:26.968
- Yet you're fugitives.
- Victims of circumstance.

47:27.569 --> 47:29.568
2000 euros.

47:29.929 --> 47:32.488
Cash. Half now, for two nights.

47:34.009 --> 47:35.208
Gimme the money.

47:40.570 --> 47:43.929
Nabil said your sister keeps all the
money and you're up your ass in debt.

47:44.810 --> 47:46.449
Nabil's got a big mouth.

47:47.930 --> 47:50.489
I suggest you change too.

48:01.811 --> 48:03.090
Come on, let's go.

48:08.411 --> 48:12.570
My daughter is just a friend
or you want to tell me something?

48:13.852 --> 48:15.051
No, it's...

48:16.812 --> 48:19.571
- Hey, no fair, what'd you say?
- Go ask him.

48:25.132 --> 48:27.171
Abdul will make sure you get a place.

48:27.572 --> 48:30.452
And it seems to me, you
probably need this more than I.

48:30.653 --> 48:32.372
We are not all mercenaries.

48:34.693 --> 48:35.532
Who are they?

48:35.933 --> 48:37.252
You're not the only one on the run.

48:39.933 --> 48:41.092
Good luck.

49:44.017 --> 49:45.216
It's okay, you can stay

49:45.417 --> 49:48.576
for two days in kids' rooms.
Alright?

49:48.777 --> 49:49.896
Thank you.

50:23.179 --> 50:24.978
When she was sick,

50:26.259 --> 50:28.458
you're all she talked about.

50:46.620 --> 50:47.859
I think...

50:50.900 --> 50:53.140
I think she still loved you.

51:18.622 --> 51:21.141
Sorry to get you guys up at this hour.

51:41.943 --> 51:43.982
Everything we found in his apartment.

51:50.914 --> 51:51.564
Hello?

51:52.224 --> 51:53.863
What have you found?

51:54.944 --> 51:58.583
He was an expatriate living
in Antwerp with his daughter.

51:59.624 --> 52:03.424
Records show, he moved here two
months ago on a business visa.

52:04.185 --> 52:07.024
Don't worry. I'll find him.

52:16.225 --> 52:17.664
My feeling is there's
really no need to press

52:17.825 --> 52:19.905
for an excavation of the boat.

52:20.066 --> 52:22.065
Self-combustion is a
common risk when you ship

52:22.226 --> 52:23.625
construction materials.

52:23.986 --> 52:27.425
I'm sure we can find a way to
compensate you for this tragic event.

52:27.786 --> 52:30.185
This is not about money,
Mr. Braymer.

52:31.106 --> 52:32.665
I want Mr. Halgate

52:33.186 --> 52:36.105
to appear here personally
and look me in the eye.

52:37.667 --> 52:40.546
And I want him to apologize
for my son's death.

52:47.027 --> 52:47.826
Where are you?

52:49.187 --> 52:50.666
Where do you think?

52:51.427 --> 52:53.946
You told me the CIA had
something you wanted.

52:54.107 --> 52:55.827
I arranged to get it.

52:55.988 --> 52:59.387
- Why did you murder these people?
- Let's meet.

52:59.588 --> 53:00.867
One hour.

53:09.708 --> 53:11.267
You dismantled the covert operation

53:11.468 --> 53:12.988
I was running for you.

53:13.149 --> 53:15.468
You used my agents to kill.

53:15.869 --> 53:18.668
You've made Logan the subject of a manhunt!
What the hell got into you?

53:18.829 --> 53:20.708
He was about to find out
the company was a fake.

53:21.269 --> 53:23.708
It was an executive decision.

53:24.149 --> 53:26.548
Logan was looking into the patents.

53:26.749 --> 53:29.748
Asking questions about who
owned the security systems.

53:29.949 --> 53:33.549
- What possessed you to get him involved?
- Because you wanted something done quick!

53:33.710 --> 53:34.989
And he's the best there is.

53:35.910 --> 53:38.189
Tell me you at least have the evidence.

53:38.990 --> 53:40.349
You know what was in the container?

53:41.230 --> 53:43.429
- Do you have it?
- We're working on it.

53:43.630 --> 53:48.190
Kohler has the container but we can't find
him, he's not answering his phone, he's...

53:49.311 --> 53:50.390
He's gone.

53:51.471 --> 53:52.950
You don't have Kohler.

53:53.271 --> 53:54.990
You don't have the evidence.

53:55.351 --> 53:58.350
- If Logan finds out what we got him involved in...
- He's just an engineer.

53:58.671 --> 54:02.790
CIA Black Ops, you idiot.
We don't make engineers.

54:03.711 --> 54:06.631
Our employer wasn't sure your
personal feelings for Logan

54:06.912 --> 54:09.751
wouldn't cloud your judgment
in making the tough calls.

54:11.512 --> 54:13.951
If Halgate goes down, I go down.

54:14.152 --> 54:17.111
No matter how much security you surround
yourself with if Logan finds out,

54:17.272 --> 54:19.551
he'll get to you.
I can fix this!

54:20.192 --> 54:22.991
Find Kohler, bring in the evidence.

54:23.513 --> 54:25.272
We'll get you his last known location.

54:25.473 --> 54:26.352
What about Ben?

54:26.553 --> 54:28.872
We've got that covered.
We brought in an expert.

55:31.756 --> 55:33.135
- Give me the number.
- Okay.

55:33.596 --> 55:34.396
Hold on, hold on.

55:38.997 --> 55:40.876
- Alright. Give me the patent number now.
- Okay.

55:41.037 --> 55:42.796
X-D-N

55:43.277 --> 55:44.596
3-6-7.

55:47.957 --> 55:49.516
Mei Ling was right.

55:51.758 --> 55:56.277
Halgate doesn't own the patent.
Belongs to Total Security in New York.

55:57.478 --> 56:00.717
Write that down: 785506.

56:02.528 --> 56:04.278
Central Intelligence Agency,
may I help you?

56:17.579 --> 56:20.038
Central Intelligence Agency,
may I help you?

56:25.639 --> 56:26.999
Alright, are you ready for this?

56:27.920 --> 56:32.319
Your office address, the address for
Halgate Security System was short-leased,

56:32.520 --> 56:35.719
six months ago to a company
called Markus Wolf Investments.

56:35.880 --> 56:38.039
That company also has another
local registered address

56:38.240 --> 56:41.359
by the same realtor,
right here in Brussels.

56:42.840 --> 56:45.720
- The realtor just told you this?
- Yeah, I know, they're dying to lease it.

56:45.881 --> 56:49.200
We gotta hurry, because it's Saturday
and the realtor gets busy.

56:49.561 --> 56:51.760
I put this at viewing in 30 minutes.

56:52.001 --> 56:54.240
Who you think you are, Sherlock Holmes?

56:55.001 --> 56:56.880
I'm gonna go get my bag.

57:26.043 --> 57:28.362
What about the previous occupant,
you ever meet him?

57:28.523 --> 57:31.442
Mr. Wolf, he's running
an investment company.

57:41.364 --> 57:43.443
Would you mind giving us a minute?

57:43.604 --> 57:44.603
Sure.

57:45.164 --> 57:47.123
- I'll be in the car.
- Thank you.

58:08.205 --> 58:10.164
- Got an eye on her?
- Yeah.

58:12.326 --> 58:15.965
- Who is Markus Wolf?
- He's an East German cold-war spy master.

58:16.286 --> 58:17.925
Somebody's idea of a joke.

58:18.126 --> 58:22.445
- Wait, so he's not even alive?
- No, he's been dead 5 years or so.

58:22.806 --> 58:24.885
Looks like I was working for
some kind of proprietary.

58:25.166 --> 58:26.565
What's a proprietary?

58:26.586 --> 58:28.886
It's a shell company,
created to do one thing,

58:28.986 --> 58:32.086
when in reality, it's doing
something completely different.

58:32.287 --> 58:34.766
So wait, why would the CIA file
patents for a shell company?

58:34.927 --> 58:38.526
Amy, quit with the questions
for a minute, okay?

58:44.567 --> 58:46.526
Disconnection hasn't gone through yet.

59:28.690 --> 59:29.889
Bingo!

59:31.250 --> 59:33.609
I pulled up caller records on
Markus Wolf Investments.

59:33.770 --> 59:35.449
Now, that office was closed yesterday,

59:35.650 --> 59:38.729
but there was a call made from
there about an hour ago.

59:53.691 --> 59:54.770
Ben.

59:56.211 --> 59:57.490
We have to move.

01:00:12.532 --> 01:00:14.811
Markus Wolf, suite 619.

01:00:15.733 --> 01:00:18.932
Keep your eyes open.
Through the mirrors.

01:00:19.133 --> 01:00:21.972
- Remember...
- Corners are safe.

01:00:22.573 --> 01:00:23.932
Don't be a smart ass.

01:00:24.293 --> 01:00:25.412
You're my eyes and ears, okay?

01:01:18.776 --> 01:01:19.975
Markus Wolf is your alias?

01:01:20.416 --> 01:01:22.655
That's cute.
What's next, Mata Hari?

01:01:44.198 --> 01:01:45.777
You're making a big mistake!

01:01:47.698 --> 01:01:50.537
There was no product
development team, was there, Derek?

01:01:55.138 --> 01:01:57.937
There was no Halgate
security systems!

01:01:58.498 --> 01:02:00.337
You got us hack into CIA!

01:02:00.498 --> 01:02:01.698
Come on.

01:02:09.379 --> 01:02:10.298
Why?

01:02:10.939 --> 01:02:12.608
For what?

01:02:31.660 --> 01:02:33.339
Who are you working for?

01:02:35.500 --> 01:02:37.220
Get outta here while you still can, Ben.

01:02:37.901 --> 01:02:39.260
Go where, you son of a bitch!

01:03:06.142 --> 01:03:07.781
You gotta start talking, pal.

01:03:09.422 --> 01:03:12.582
You put my daughter's life in danger.
I want answers!

01:03:26.863 --> 01:03:28.742
She said it was a simple operation.

01:03:29.103 --> 01:03:31.703
- Who's she?
- She told them to hire you.

01:03:37.184 --> 01:03:39.623
She said we never recover
the documents without you.

01:03:41.144 --> 01:03:42.104
Recover what documents?

01:03:54.005 --> 01:03:55.424
- Recover what documents?
- Dad!

01:03:55.625 --> 01:03:57.424
In the canister on the couch.

01:03:57.625 --> 01:03:59.344
Wait outside. Go on!

01:04:00.825 --> 01:04:02.544
Wait outside, go on!

01:04:04.905 --> 01:04:06.305
I got a family, too.

01:04:07.386 --> 01:04:08.945
This was gonna be my pension.

01:04:12.506 --> 01:04:15.505
- If I die, they'll look after my family.
- Who will look after your family?

01:04:15.666 --> 01:04:16.865
The Agency.

01:04:17.066 --> 01:04:19.025
- You were CIA?
- Shoot me!

01:04:19.466 --> 01:04:20.865
- Dad!
- Shoot me!

01:04:33.267 --> 01:04:34.946
Come here.

01:04:47.868 --> 01:04:49.467
Get the room searched.

01:04:52.148 --> 01:04:53.147
Ben!

01:05:02.669 --> 01:05:03.748
Go back!

01:05:11.629 --> 01:05:12.828
Go! Over here!

01:05:17.790 --> 01:05:18.789
Get up! Come on, get over!

01:05:38.271 --> 01:05:39.710
Stand down!

01:05:40.911 --> 01:05:43.910
I said, stand down!
He's one of us, for Christ sakes!

01:05:50.511 --> 01:05:51.721
Ben?

01:05:54.712 --> 01:05:57.831
Whatever is going on,
we can figure it out.

01:06:06.032 --> 01:06:07.711
We can protect you.

01:06:08.913 --> 01:06:10.232
Both of you.

01:06:21.313 --> 01:06:22.013
Ben?

01:06:25.013 --> 01:06:25.613
Ben?

01:06:28.474 --> 01:06:29.273
Back off!

01:06:30.674 --> 01:06:31.593
Put 'em down!

01:06:31.914 --> 01:06:33.353
Stand back.

01:06:34.554 --> 01:06:36.193
Kick 'em away!

01:06:38.514 --> 01:06:41.233
What have you got me involved with, Anna?

01:06:43.194 --> 01:06:44.474
You've got this all wrong.

01:06:47.515 --> 01:06:49.394
- You gotta trust me.
- Dad, get in!

01:06:50.635 --> 01:06:52.034
Get back!

01:06:52.715 --> 01:06:54.114
They'll find you.

01:06:54.275 --> 01:06:55.514
They'll kill you.
They'll kill her!

01:06:56.835 --> 01:06:58.954
- I can help you go home.
- Dad, get in the car!

01:06:59.155 --> 01:07:01.194
- No, listen to me, please!
- Why?

01:07:01.356 --> 01:07:03.995
You stood by six months ago and
watched the Committee burn me.

01:07:04.156 --> 01:07:07.955
Stood by? You were part if a kill squad!
You questioned your orders!

01:07:08.436 --> 01:07:10.475
I was the one who stopped
them from killing you.

01:07:10.676 --> 01:07:11.635
Dad, get in the car!

01:07:11.796 --> 01:07:13.635
Give me the bag, Ben.

01:07:14.236 --> 01:07:15.315
You're good, Anna.

01:07:15.636 --> 01:07:17.435
You're very good.

01:07:19.117 --> 01:07:19.717
Ben!

01:07:20.277 --> 01:07:21.226
Go!

01:07:34.637 --> 01:07:36.516
- Who is she?
- Who taught you to drive?

01:07:36.718 --> 01:07:37.837
No, who is she?

01:07:37.998 --> 01:07:39.957
Just someone I used to work with.

01:07:45.718 --> 01:07:46.717
CIA.

01:07:54.799 --> 01:07:58.038
- What are you doing?
- Don't lie to me, I'm not an idiot, I saw you.

01:08:01.999 --> 01:08:03.358
Slow down, Amy.

01:08:04.239 --> 01:08:08.438
What's a kill squad?
What's a kill squad?

01:08:11.639 --> 01:08:13.079
Slow down, Amy!

01:08:16.479 --> 01:08:18.038
Amy, brakes!

01:08:35.041 --> 01:08:36.680
I kill people.

01:08:38.441 --> 01:08:40.680
That's what a kill squad is all about,
killing people.

01:08:40.841 --> 01:08:42.279
The dirty work.

01:08:43.361 --> 01:08:45.279
The things that have to be done.

01:08:46.401 --> 01:08:48.520
The things nobody wants to do.

01:08:50.442 --> 01:08:52.081
I did these things.

01:08:56.122 --> 01:08:58.441
I never wanted my daughter to find out.

01:09:01.362 --> 01:09:03.081
You didn't come back for me.

01:09:05.883 --> 01:09:06.881
I did!

01:09:07.523 --> 01:09:11.442
You've came to me, because
you had nowhere else to go.

01:09:13.763 --> 01:09:15.562
I had friends.

01:09:16.363 --> 01:09:18.042
I had a life, dad!

01:09:23.444 --> 01:09:24.803
You brought me

01:09:25.124 --> 01:09:26.923
to a foreign country,

01:09:29.124 --> 01:09:31.723
lied, to get me here.

01:09:32.844 --> 01:09:34.643
You lied to me about everything.

01:09:37.484 --> 01:09:40.004
Why couldn't you just leave me alone?

01:09:43.125 --> 01:09:43.725
Amy!

01:09:44.725 --> 01:09:45.325
Amy!

01:09:49.925 --> 01:09:50.524
Amy!

01:09:53.825 --> 01:09:54.425
Amy!

01:09:58.226 --> 01:09:58.826
Amy!

01:10:32.407 --> 01:10:34.007
I need a telephone.

01:10:35.028 --> 01:10:35.828
A telephone.

01:10:46.628 --> 01:10:47.328
Hello?

01:10:48.208 --> 01:10:49.207
Grandpa?

01:10:49.488 --> 01:10:52.528
Amy, oh my God, are you okay?

01:10:54.729 --> 01:10:57.208
I've been trying to call you.
Where are you?

01:11:01.369 --> 01:11:03.448
Grandpa, I wanna come home.

01:11:05.049 --> 01:11:07.888
You sound terrible.
Is everything alright?

01:11:10.890 --> 01:11:13.049
Amy? Hello?

01:12:17.853 --> 01:12:19.273
Hey, you! I'm talking to you!

01:12:19.374 --> 01:12:21.613
They killed my brother in front
of my five year old niece!

01:12:21.814 --> 01:12:24.384
They were looking for you!
I want their names!

01:12:24.434 --> 01:12:26.053
I want to know who they are!
I want them dead!

01:12:28.454 --> 01:12:29.893
So do I.

01:12:31.374 --> 01:12:32.933
They took Amy.

01:12:35.134 --> 01:12:36.454
Get in the car!

01:13:22.977 --> 01:13:25.536
Altheon X-135 solid state.

01:13:28.617 --> 01:13:31.017
"Xyston TA-20" Polemarch.

01:13:31.178 --> 01:13:32.497
What's a "Polemarch"?

01:13:33.738 --> 01:13:35.057
Polemarch.

01:13:36.218 --> 01:13:37.457
It's a radar tracking system.

01:13:44.978 --> 01:13:47.898
It's parts inside IAT drone defense system.

01:13:49.259 --> 01:13:51.978
That cargo ship was carrying U.S.
made weapons.

01:13:52.859 --> 01:13:54.658
For Mozambique.

01:14:02.579 --> 01:14:04.619
Necessary conditions
to secure business...

01:14:05.580 --> 01:14:06.739
Lithium.

01:14:07.940 --> 01:14:10.739
- What's a Lithium?
- Next generation technology.

01:14:11.460 --> 01:14:12.739
Nuclear power.

01:14:14.620 --> 01:14:18.259
Mobile telecommunications,
electric cars, that kind of thing.

01:14:18.660 --> 01:14:19.819
Halgate Group.

01:14:22.741 --> 01:14:23.860
Anna.

01:14:37.021 --> 01:14:38.100
What about Amy?

01:14:39.581 --> 01:14:41.661
I thought we were trying to find her.

01:14:42.462 --> 01:14:44.901
"James Halgate III."

01:14:47.862 --> 01:14:49.541
We just did.

01:14:53.442 --> 01:14:54.192
Hello?

01:14:54.262 --> 01:14:55.461
You know what I have?

01:14:58.863 --> 01:14:59.702
I'm listening.

01:14:59.983 --> 01:15:03.382
Gare du Nord, Platform 4, one hour.

01:15:45.145 --> 01:15:45.745
Hello?

01:15:46.225 --> 01:15:48.504
There's a train, Platform 5.

01:15:50.105 --> 01:15:51.345
Get on it.

01:15:51.786 --> 01:15:53.425
Front carriage.

01:15:58.346 --> 01:15:59.985
Go! Over there!

01:16:05.746 --> 01:16:07.625
Get off the train, now.

01:16:21.827 --> 01:16:23.906
There's a train pulling into Platform 8.

01:16:24.667 --> 01:16:26.187
Hurry.

01:16:28.028 --> 01:16:29.627
Rear compartment.

01:17:08.030 --> 01:17:10.109
That's the Anna I know.

01:17:18.390 --> 01:17:21.470
I see you've been selling your
services to The Halgate Group.

01:17:24.791 --> 01:17:27.310
How long has Halgate been
reaching into the CIA?

01:17:28.071 --> 01:17:30.430
How long have you been
in bed with him, Anna?

01:17:30.791 --> 01:17:32.390
All the way back to Somalia?

01:17:32.451 --> 01:17:33.051
No.

01:17:36.252 --> 01:17:36.852
No.

01:17:43.632 --> 01:17:47.071
I'll never forget the first
day you showed up in Somalia.

01:17:48.152 --> 01:17:50.271
Ready to set the world on fire.

01:17:52.432 --> 01:17:54.232
We stood for something.

01:17:56.033 --> 01:17:58.232
We believed we could change the world.

01:17:59.993 --> 01:18:01.952
What do you believe in now, Anna?

01:18:02.153 --> 01:18:04.272
I believe you should have listened to me.

01:18:04.673 --> 01:18:06.032
I told you,

01:18:06.273 --> 01:18:09.952
these people will sop at nothing
to get what they want.

01:18:10.273 --> 01:18:12.993
How did you become everything
we fought against?

01:18:15.954 --> 01:18:17.233
It's just business, Ben.

01:18:17.994 --> 01:18:20.073
It's my daughter's life!

01:18:21.394 --> 01:18:23.153
Just give them what they want.

01:18:24.074 --> 01:18:26.673
Oh, yeah, yeah.
And then we'll be safe?

01:18:28.054 --> 01:18:28.654
Yeah.

01:18:29.275 --> 01:18:30.634
I can't.

01:18:35.275 --> 01:18:39.394
I want you to go your boss, your
real boss, with a message.

01:18:40.835 --> 01:18:42.434
I know who he is.

01:18:43.635 --> 01:18:45.554
I know where he's gonna be.

01:18:45.955 --> 01:18:48.155
If he has her, I want her.

01:18:49.116 --> 01:18:50.795
If he's harmed her,

01:18:51.876 --> 01:18:53.435
he's dead.

01:19:25.878 --> 01:19:27.277
It was the only one I could find.

01:19:27.478 --> 01:19:28.537
Would it do?

01:19:30.458 --> 01:19:31.208
Oh, yeah.

01:19:31.718 --> 01:19:33.557
Thank you, Nabil.
That's perfect.

01:20:12.440 --> 01:20:14.319
James Halgate III has
arrived in the Belgium

01:20:14.520 --> 01:20:17.120
courthouse today in an effort
to settle the longstanding

01:20:17.321 --> 01:20:20.280
class action suit against his company.
The suit was put forth

01:20:20.481 --> 01:20:22.960
by the bereaved families of
those who lost loved ones,

01:20:23.161 --> 01:20:26.080
when the ship owned by
The Halgate Group, The Serenity,

01:20:26.281 --> 01:20:27.920
sank off the coast of Belgium.

01:20:28.081 --> 01:20:31.440
150 lives were lost in this tragedy.

01:20:35.922 --> 01:20:37.041
Ms Pieters,

01:20:37.322 --> 01:20:40.081
I am deeply sorry for your loss.

01:20:40.442 --> 01:20:43.201
I hope you will accept
our offer of support

01:20:43.402 --> 01:20:45.561
in your hour of need.

01:20:49.322 --> 01:20:51.442
Is there a settlement
I don't know about?

01:21:11.644 --> 01:21:12.963
No, I'm sorry, I don't comment.

01:21:21.084 --> 01:21:24.043
I'm sorry, no comment.
Thank you very much.

01:21:35.605 --> 01:21:36.844
I'll catch you later.

01:21:38.485 --> 01:21:39.444
For you!

01:21:40.685 --> 01:21:42.324
I'll talk to you later.
Thank you very much.

01:21:42.966 --> 01:21:44.605
Your boss comes alone.

01:21:45.566 --> 01:21:48.005
When I know she's safe,
you'll get your evidence.

01:21:49.526 --> 01:21:50.325
I'm listening.

01:21:50.726 --> 01:21:54.045
Keep this phone on you.
I'll text you a time and a place.

01:22:12.687 --> 01:22:13.766
Hold it!

01:22:36.689 --> 01:22:38.328
- I told you to wait!
- I need to speak to him.

01:22:38.489 --> 01:22:40.488
- He's dealing with the regional president.
- I don't give a shit.

01:22:40.769 --> 01:22:43.208
He doesn't meet the help.

01:22:49.689 --> 01:22:50.488
Anna!

01:22:53.810 --> 01:22:54.889
Mr. Halgate?

01:22:55.450 --> 01:22:58.769
- I didn't realize we had a one o'clock.
- She was just leaving.

01:22:59.210 --> 01:23:00.929
He's going to kill you.

01:23:01.570 --> 01:23:04.489
You must be the
mercurial Anna Brandt.

01:23:04.650 --> 01:23:06.009
- I'm honored!
- You took the girl.

01:23:06.210 --> 01:23:07.489
Where is she?

01:23:08.470 --> 01:23:11.650
So much trouble because
of one little accident!

01:23:11.851 --> 01:23:14.490
Because one little ship sinks.

01:23:16.411 --> 01:23:20.090
I'm flying back to Chicago
in exactly four hours.

01:23:21.171 --> 01:23:22.810
I need this fixed before I leave.

01:23:23.051 --> 01:23:24.930
Let me make the exchange.
I know Ben.

01:23:25.291 --> 01:23:28.490
You seem very concerned
about his welfare, Anna.

01:23:28.772 --> 01:23:31.811
I've compromised my
entire career for you.

01:23:32.012 --> 01:23:33.891
For money that's in an
account I can't touch

01:23:34.092 --> 01:23:35.451
if this blows up.

01:23:35.612 --> 01:23:39.611
I'll do whatever needs to be done
to neutralize the situation.

01:23:40.492 --> 01:23:42.731
You and I are cut from
the same cloth, Anna.

01:23:43.372 --> 01:23:45.811
We know what we want
and how to get it.

01:23:46.453 --> 01:23:49.772
We're capable of making the
tough calls when required.

01:23:50.133 --> 01:23:51.612
Jim, you said we could
do this ourselves.

01:23:55.373 --> 01:23:56.652
It's Logan.

01:23:56.933 --> 01:23:59.612
The monument by the Palace of Justice.

01:23:59.813 --> 01:24:00.652
At three.

01:24:01.573 --> 01:24:03.572
- I'll get the car.
- There's no need.

01:24:04.134 --> 01:24:06.973
The only reason I came
to this backwater,

01:24:07.134 --> 01:24:11.093
was to make sure I'm on the
plane home with my evidence.

01:24:11.814 --> 01:24:13.853
Anna will get it for me.

01:26:20.421 --> 01:26:21.540
Run, Amy!

01:26:21.941 --> 01:26:23.220
Run!

01:26:45.543 --> 01:26:47.502
Shall I get the car now?

01:27:40.706 --> 01:27:42.345
I thought I told you to come alone.

01:27:42.506 --> 01:27:45.745
Mr. Braymer is here to serve
our mutual interests.

01:27:45.946 --> 01:27:48.065
Maybe he can tell me how much
it cost to buy the CIA?

01:27:48.346 --> 01:27:50.425
Are we talking gross or net?

01:27:51.706 --> 01:27:52.705
Where is she?

01:27:52.866 --> 01:27:56.266
You give us what we want,
you'll get what you want.

01:27:57.627 --> 01:27:59.946
You fan the flames of a civil war.

01:28:00.347 --> 01:28:03.106
Selling weapons
to tribal factions.

01:28:03.267 --> 01:28:07.186
- For what? Access to lithium mines?
- Protecting our interests.

01:28:07.347 --> 01:28:10.506
What these people did in their spare time,
was their own business.

01:28:10.707 --> 01:28:13.627
Yeah, except The Justice Department
was gonna figure you out.

01:28:13.788 --> 01:28:15.388
So you hired a bunch of
immigrants to do the work.

01:28:15.488 --> 01:28:17.238
Then when they step out of line...

01:28:17.308 --> 01:28:19.467
- Mr. Logan!
- People have died!

01:28:19.828 --> 01:28:21.707
So you could cover your tracks.

01:28:23.308 --> 01:28:24.507
Trust,

01:28:24.708 --> 01:28:25.867
Mr. Logan,

01:28:26.628 --> 01:28:28.788
is a precious resource.

01:28:53.550 --> 01:28:55.069
Give me the documents, Ben.

01:28:57.030 --> 01:28:59.709
Don't lose sight of reality,
like Anna did.

01:29:00.950 --> 01:29:03.990
- Where is Anna?
- Let's just say she wasn't a team player.

01:29:04.351 --> 01:29:09.350
Don't let your noble moral compass get in the way, Ben.
Where has it gotten you?

01:29:10.671 --> 01:29:11.910
You have nothing.

01:29:12.631 --> 01:29:13.670
No job.

01:29:14.191 --> 01:29:15.470
No money.

01:29:16.951 --> 01:29:18.350
No country.

01:29:19.111 --> 01:29:20.870
- Give me my daughter.
- No.

01:29:22.672 --> 01:29:24.471
It has to be you,

01:29:24.672 --> 01:29:26.231
for her.

01:29:27.392 --> 01:29:30.271
- We had a deal.
- And now we're negotiating terms.

01:29:30.432 --> 01:29:32.751
Oh, I'm sure you can
understand our position.

01:30:14.955 --> 01:30:17.394
You okay? Did they hurt you?

01:30:20.355 --> 01:30:21.674
Look at you.

01:30:30.515 --> 01:30:32.955
- Take this.
- What's going on?

01:30:33.476 --> 01:30:34.595
You're gonna be just fine.

01:30:34.956 --> 01:30:37.835
I want you to leave and
get as far away as you can.

01:30:38.696 --> 01:30:39.296
No.

01:30:40.836 --> 01:30:41.875
I have to stay here.

01:30:44.716 --> 01:30:46.995
- No, you can't do that, you...
- I have no choice.

01:30:47.996 --> 01:30:49.756
- This is who I am.
- No, it's not!

01:30:49.917 --> 01:30:51.956
This is how I make a difference.

01:31:00.957 --> 01:31:01.876
Go.

01:31:27.359 --> 01:31:29.078
Don't have any second thoughts.

01:31:29.719 --> 01:31:31.998
She'll never be free if you do.

01:31:33.039 --> 01:31:35.798
I believe you've forgotten something.

01:31:47.360 --> 01:31:49.359
You don't look like CIA.
