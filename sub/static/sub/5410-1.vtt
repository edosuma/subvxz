Thank you.

15:45.925 --> 15:47.427
HEATHER: Oh, whatever,
Melissa, okay?

15:47.593 --> 15:49.095
I'm just offended
by a pagan sacrifice

15:49.262 --> 15:51.305
to ward off evil spirits
on Christmas.

15:51.472 --> 15:53.558
Heather, we're just having
a little bit of fun.

15:53.933 --> 15:55.935
Christmas is more about warding
off evil spirits than Halloween.

15:56.102 --> 15:58.062
What Christmas shit

15:58.229 --> 16:00.481
in this room resembles
anything Christian, huh?

16:00.857 --> 16:03.359
It's all
neo-pagan magic.

16:03.526 --> 16:04.527
Christmas tree...

16:04.902 --> 16:07.238
a magical rite ensuring
the return of the crops.

16:07.405 --> 16:09.949
The mistletoe is nothing
but a conception charm.

12 days in December
where the nights were long

16:16.497 --> 16:18.958
and the Earth was roamed
by the demons of chaos.

16:19.125 --> 16:21.377
And fucking Santa Claus?

16:21.544 --> 16:25.298
This fat voyeur
that watches you all year long

16:25.465 --> 16:27.050
to make sure you live up to

16:27.216 --> 16:30.136
his standards of decency before
breaking into your house?

16:30.303 --> 16:33.222
And that is different
from what Billy did... how?

16:35.099 --> 16:38.561
Billy didn't break in.

16:39.562 --> 16:41.564

boyfriend,

28:03.246 --> 28:04.205
no family.

where does she have to go?

30:07.078 --> 30:08.788
I don't know.
I was just packing. What...

30:08.955 --> 30:12.041

30:25.972 --> 30:27.765
What are you doing in there?

30:27.932 --> 30:30.435
I wanted to spend
the night with you.

30:32.103 --> 30:33.813
It's okay.

30:33.980 --> 30:34.981
KYLE :
And I knew that mama-san

30:35.148 --> 30:37.775
and your sisters here would kick
me out, so I-I tried to sneak

30:37.942 --> 30:40.445
into your room, but the window
wasn't open, so I, uh,

30:40.820 --> 30:42.780
I saw that,
I saw that Megan's was,

30:42.947 --> 30:44.866
so I climbed up here
to see you.

01:01:05.770 --> 01:01:06.688
(grunting)

01:01:06.854 --> 01:01:09.649
(pounding on door)

01:01:15.196 --> 01:01:16.906
It's blocked.

01:01:17.073 --> 01:01:19.742
(car engine rattles to a stop)

01:01:19.909 --> 01:01:22.578
Come on. Come on.

01:01:56.070 --> 01:01:57.822
(sighing gently)

01:02:18.634 --> 01:02:20.219
(sighs)

01:02:23.890 --> 01:02:25.892
(gasping)

01:02:44.744 --> 01:02:47.664
(panting)

01:02:57.757 --> 01:03:00.760
(gasps, panting)

01:03:04.681 --> 01:03:07.183
(muffled choking)

01:03:14.774 --> 01:03:15.692
Oh, God.

01:03:16.985 --> 01:03:18.736
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

01:03:25.868 --> 01:03:28.454
(heavy footsteps)

01:03:30.248 --> 01:03:31.791
Go!

01:03:32.792 --> 01:03:34.961
- Lauren, where's Mel?
- KELLI : Shut up.

01:03:35.128 --> 01:03:36.838
- Where is Melissa?
- He'll hear you.

01:03:37.005 --> 01:03:39.382
(footsteps)

01:03:39.757 --> 01:03:41.843
(Kelli panting)

01:03:45.888 --> 01:03:48.349
(beeping)

01:03:48.474 --> 01:03:51.436
(slow footsteps)

01:03:51.811 --> 01:03:53.980
("Jingle Bells"
ring tone playing)

01:03:58.151 --> 01:04:00.361
("Jingle Bells" continues)

01:04:02.822 --> 01:04:04.991
("Jingle Bells" stops)

01:04:10.455 --> 01:04:12.457
(yelling, grunting)

01:04:12.832 --> 01:04:14.208
Oh, my God... Kyle!

01:04:14.375 --> 01:04:15.460
LEIGH :
Stop! It's me!

01:04:15.793 --> 01:04:18.046
(grunting)

01:04:22.425 --> 01:04:23.760
- No!
- (screams)

01:04:23.926 --> 01:04:26.012
(screaming)

01:04:27.305 --> 01:04:29.766
(yelling)

01:04:29.932 --> 01:04:30.892
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa!

01:04:31.017 --> 01:04:32.393
There are two bodies
in the driveway.

01:04:32.769 --> 01:04:33.770
- Maybe you did it!
- No!

01:04:33.936 --> 01:04:34.437
Maybe you did that!

01:04:34.812 --> 01:04:35.813
It wasn't... him.

01:04:35.980 --> 01:04:36.939
How do you know?

01:04:37.106 --> 01:04:38.983
(dialing)

01:04:40.234 --> 01:04:42.278
(wind howling)

01:04:47.283 --> 01:04:49.952
("Jingle Bells" ring tone
playing)

01:04:56.417 --> 01:04:57.835
("Jingle Bells" continues)

01:04:58.002 --> 01:04:59.921
- (light clattering)
- ("Jingle Bells" stops)

01:05:03.800 --> 01:05:06.386
(wind howling)

01:05:11.224 --> 01:05:12.850
(creaking footfalls)

01:05:13.017 --> 01:05:15.937
(phone playing "Dance
of the Sugarplum Fairy")

01:05:19.065 --> 01:05:21.943
(whispering over phone) :
Where's Agnes?

01:05:22.110 --> 01:05:25.279
- (girl whimpering in background)
- What have you done... Billy?

01:05:25.446 --> 01:05:27.490
She's my family now.

01:05:27.865 --> 01:05:29.867
(creaking footfalls)

01:05:30.910 --> 01:05:32.412
(snaps phone shut)

01:05:32.578 --> 01:05:35.289
(whispers, panting) :
He's in the attic...

01:05:35.456 --> 01:05:38.126
and I hear
someone else.

01:05:44.090 --> 01:05:46.551
(floorboards creaking)

01:05:51.097 --> 01:05:53.141
(whispering) :
Hey, hey, no fucking way.

01:05:53.307 --> 01:05:54.308
Let's go.

01:05:54.475 --> 01:05:56.102
Clair might be alive...
she might be up there.

01:05:56.269 --> 01:05:57.520
No, Eve's not,
Heather's not, Ms. Mac...

01:05:57.895 --> 01:05:59.480
I heard more than one voice
on those phone calls.

01:05:59.856 --> 01:06:00.940
And I have searched
the whole house.

01:06:01.107 --> 01:06:02.942
And I've seen under it.
Where else could he be?

01:06:03.109 --> 01:06:06.571
Until I see that she's dead,
she is alive.

01:06:06.946 --> 01:06:09.198
This is Billy fucking Lenz
we're talking about here, okay?

01:06:09.365 --> 01:06:10.950
He's probably listening to us
right now.

01:06:11.117 --> 01:06:13.286
Yeah, and if I had a sister, I
would expect her to go up there.

01:06:13.453 --> 01:06:14.912
How would you know?
You don't have a sister.

01:06:15.079 --> 01:06:16.372
She does.

01:06:20.626 --> 01:06:22.879
Now, let's go.

01:06:23.046 --> 01:06:23.546
Wait.

01:06:23.921 --> 01:06:25.381
If we go up there,

01:06:25.548 --> 01:06:27.300
the second we see
they're dead,

01:06:27.425 --> 01:06:29.093
we run the fuck
out of this house.

01:06:32.889 --> 01:06:34.640

(panting)

01:07:21.145 --> 01:07:24.440
I open the door,
and you hit the light.

01:07:24.607 --> 01:07:25.942
Okay?

01:07:26.109 --> 01:07:27.402
Okay.

01:07:49.173 --> 01:07:51.676
(whispering) :
One, two...

01:07:55.013 --> 01:07:57.390
(wind blowing)

01:08:07.650 --> 01:08:10.611
(screaming)

01:08:10.737 --> 01:08:12.488
(screaming continues)

01:08:12.655 --> 01:08:14.282

No... no... no!

01:08:51.486 --> 01:08:53.529
No...!

01:08:53.696 --> 01:08:54.529
God, no!

01:08:54.697 --> 01:08:56.157
Clair!

01:08:56.282 --> 01:08:57.033
No!

01:08:57.200 --> 01:08:58.033

No! No!

01:09:13.633 --> 01:09:14.801
Oh, no! No!

01:09:15.134 --> 01:09:18.304
He's my family now.

01:09:18.470 --> 01:09:20.264
No! No...!

01:09:20.430 --> 01:09:22.517
No! Leigh!

home for Christmas.

Dr. Forest, please dial 118...

01:14:32.869 --> 01:14:34.954
All right,
good to go.

01:14:35.079 --> 01:14:36.497
Still more questions
than answers tonight

at Clement University Hospital,

01:14:38.750 --> 01:14:41.627
on what should have been a
typically quiet Christmas Eve.

01:14:41.753 --> 01:14:44.464
Earlier, escaped notorious
murderer Billy Lenz,

01:14:44.630 --> 01:14:45.965
along with his sister Agnes...

01:14:46.132 --> 01:14:48.760
unaccounted for since her recent
release from Woodville...

01:14:48.926 --> 01:14:50.803
together went on
a murderous rampage...

01:14:53.097 --> 01:14:54.807
(indistinct voice over
ear piece)

01:14:54.932 --> 01:14:56.059
No, I'm the only one here.

01:14:56.434 --> 01:14:57.643
What about the M.E.?

01:14:57.769 --> 01:14:59.562
(chuckles)
M.E. barely made it in.

01:14:59.729 --> 01:15:00.980
Are you gonna be home soon?

01:15:01.105 --> 01:15:02.607
No, I won't be home
till after noon.

01:15:02.774 --> 01:15:05.902
Well, 'cause he wants us to
identify all the bodies,

01:15:06.069 --> 01:15:07.862
and we've only done two.

01:15:08.029 --> 01:15:09.822
Remember when we talked
about this last night?

01:15:09.947 --> 01:15:11.741
Uh-huh.

01:15:11.908 --> 01:15:12.742
- Don't you?
- Yes.

01:15:12.909 --> 01:15:14.661
You know what day it is?

01:15:14.786 --> 01:15:16.829
Of course I know what day it is;
the kids'll have to wait.

01:15:22.919 --> 01:15:26.172
Think I want to be doing
this on Christmas?

01:15:26.506 --> 01:15:28.800
I'm doing my frickin' job.

01:15:30.968 --> 01:15:32.679
Mmm.

01:15:37.517 --> 01:15:39.894
Ooh, yes, sir.

How long could they have
been in the house for?

01:16:41.247 --> 01:16:43.708
Months? Years?

01:16:43.875 --> 01:16:47.128
We're not gonna
know that now.

01:16:47.503 --> 01:16:49.213
We're never gonna know.

01:17:02.852 --> 01:17:05.063
I'm not gonna be able to open
this in front of...

won't be in tomorrow.

Kelli?

01:18:49.834 --> 01:18:52.962
I thought they took you
to get your X-rays.

01:18:54.339 --> 01:18:56.966
You okay?
