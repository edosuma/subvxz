WEBVTT

00:02.294 --> 00:03.961
[Knocking] [Mac] Dee.
Dee. Dee. Dee.

00:04.046 --> 00:05.963
Sweet Dee. Sweet Dee. Sweet Dee.
Sweet Dee. [Dennis] Hey!

00:06.048 --> 00:07.757
Sweet Dee. Sweet Dee. Sweet Dee.
Sweet Dee. Sweet Dee.

00:07.883 --> 00:09.300
What?
Hey.

00:09.426 --> 00:11.135
Hey- Oh-
What the hell is this?

00:11.220 --> 00:12.804
- Oh, yeah.
- [Purring]

00:12.888 --> 00:15.139
- [Dennis] Uh-oh.
- And so it begins.

00:15.224 --> 00:17.433
- Mmm. - What are you talking about?
I got a cat. So what?

00:17.559 --> 00:21.979
Congratulations, Dee. You've begun your
transformation into crazy cat lady.

00:22.064 --> 00:24.482
I didn't begin a transformation.
I just- I just got a cat...

00:24.566 --> 00:26.484
'cause I wanted
something to hang out with.

00:26.568 --> 00:28.820
I don't have, you know,
a roommate or anything,

00:28.904 --> 00:31.197
and I don't really have
anyone to talk to, so I...

00:31.281 --> 00:33.700
If you listen to yourself, you would realize
you're only strengthening our argument.

00:33.826 --> 00:35.868
What do you want?
We need a big bowl for popcorn.

00:35.953 --> 00:37.787
- Yeah!
- Mac and Dennis movie night!

00:37.871 --> 00:39.747
Whoosh!
Tuesday night's movie night!

00:39.832 --> 00:41.332
We're doing Predator again.

00:41.417 --> 00:43.167
You guys don't have a bowl?
Um...

00:43.293 --> 00:47.130
We don't have a big one, no.
Not a big enough one for what we need, Dee.

00:47.256 --> 00:49.006
[Clattering] All right!
Be careful! Come on!

00:49.133 --> 00:50.550
These cups suck.
You serious?

00:50.634 --> 00:52.135
Yeah. Oh!
Bingo.

00:52.219 --> 00:53.678
Yeah, you found it.
Nice.

00:53.762 --> 00:56.723
Why did you guys have to both
come over here to get one bowl?

00:56.849 --> 00:59.350
It's more fun if we both come.
I was gonna hold the bowl.

00:59.476 --> 01:02.145
Dennis was gonna stand next to me and
make snide comments. Yeah. That's right.

01:02.271 --> 01:04.063
Oh, you look like a bird.
That's one. Uh- Old.

01:04.188 --> 01:06.649
Pick a new one. You got a new one?
It's an oldie but goodie.

01:06.734 --> 01:08.943
- He comes up with good ones.
- Yeah, no. That was a good one.

01:09.027 --> 01:12.071
I don't understand why you can't make snide
remarks and hold a bowl at the same time though.

01:12.197 --> 01:14.657
It doesn't make sense. You're fixating
too much on the bowl aspect of it.

01:14.742 --> 01:16.784
Put it this way. If the two
of us didn't come together,

01:16.910 --> 01:18.995
what if one of us were
to get into a jam? Mmm.

01:19.079 --> 01:20.580
Be silly not to have
the other one there.

01:20.706 --> 01:22.999
Silly? Dennis, that sounds
downright dangerous. Yeah.

01:23.125 --> 01:26.836
See, you'll never get out of a jam because
you got no friends. Well, you're a spinster.

01:26.962 --> 01:28.045
Mm-hmm.
A lonely spinster.

01:28.130 --> 01:29.756
With a cat.

01:29.882 --> 01:31.716
[Both Giggling]
Those are all funny.

01:31.800 --> 01:34.469
It's funny 'cause I feel like you
guys are two codependent losers...

01:34.553 --> 01:36.053
who are so wrapped up
in each other...

01:36.138 --> 01:38.264
that it's hard for you to see
how pathetic your lives are.

01:38.348 --> 01:39.807
It's like you're
an old married couple.

01:39.892 --> 01:42.310
No, Dee.
We're more like a dynamic duo.

01:42.394 --> 01:44.395
So you don't think that
two 30-year-old men...

01:44.480 --> 01:47.982
who spend every waking moment
together is a little bit pathetic?

01:48.066 --> 01:49.901
Well, we don't spend every
waking moment together.

01:49.985 --> 01:51.778
- What are you, crazy?
- You're right. I'm sorry.

01:51.862 --> 01:54.947
When was the last time you went more
than an hour without seeing each other?

01:55.073 --> 01:56.908
All the time.
Every day.

01:56.992 --> 01:59.744
- Okay. Without checking in?
- Ch- Checking. That's...

01:59.870 --> 02:01.329
Uh-huh.
He always checks in with me.

02:01.455 --> 02:03.873
Yeah, yeah, yeah. He likes to have
me check in, but it's not like...

02:03.957 --> 02:06.250
Okay.
Enjoy that movie, boners.

02:06.335 --> 02:08.419
[Exhales]

02:08.503 --> 02:10.670
She doesn't know anything
about friendship, dude.

02:10.756 --> 02:12.757
No. How could she?
She doesn't have any friends.

02:12.841 --> 02:15.259
"Old married couple."
That's what she called...

02:15.344 --> 02:17.094
[Both Chuckling]

02:58.178 --> 02:59.428
[Door Opens]

02:59.513 --> 03:02.265
- Hey-oh.
- Yo, where you been?

03:02.349 --> 03:04.892
What do you mean?
I was getting the movie.

03:04.977 --> 03:06.769
Yeah, but you weren't answering
any of my calls.

03:06.854 --> 03:09.230
I've been calling you...
sort of over and over again.

03:09.314 --> 03:11.440
I was having a conversation
with the video store clerk.

03:11.525 --> 03:14.902
Yeah, but I texted you 911, dude.
That means it's an emergency.

03:15.028 --> 03:16.946
Yeah, I saw that.
Yeah.

03:17.072 --> 03:19.657
Uh, what was the emergency, Mac?
Well, I couldn't get in touch with you, dude.

03:19.783 --> 03:21.993
I almost called the police.
The police?

03:22.077 --> 03:23.703
I mean, that's
a bit of an overreaction.

03:23.829 --> 03:27.540
I was gone for what, an hour?
Yeah, but I thought we had a deal.

03:27.624 --> 03:29.667
You know, you would check in
every once in a while,

03:29.751 --> 03:32.128
and then that way I would know
that you were okay.

03:32.212 --> 03:33.838
Okay. I- I'm okay.

03:33.922 --> 03:35.548
Uh, I'm sorry.
Can we watch the movie?

03:35.674 --> 03:37.592
Yeah. Great. Sure.
Yeah.

03:37.676 --> 03:40.177
The Transporter 2?

03:40.262 --> 03:42.305
Yeah, I-
Look, man. I-I-I...

03:42.389 --> 03:44.015
I know you wanted
to see Predator again,

03:44.099 --> 03:46.893
but I feel like we've seen that 30
times in the last two months...

03:46.977 --> 03:48.686
and thought maybe
we could mix things up.

03:48.770 --> 03:51.147
Video store clerk guy said
this movie's awesome, so...

03:51.231 --> 03:54.567
The video store... clerk guy.
I feel like you won't...

03:54.651 --> 03:56.319
[Chuckles]
stop talking about him.

03:56.445 --> 03:59.155
Huh. I asked him for a movie
recommendation, okay?

03:59.281 --> 04:01.866
Yeah. And you got one.
It's really not that big of a deal.

04:01.950 --> 04:05.703
Well, the big deal, Dennis, is that I wasn't
even consulted on the decision. Okay?

04:05.787 --> 04:08.247
And this is a big deal to me as well.
It's also my night.

04:08.332 --> 04:10.708
Plus, Transporter 2?
We haven't seen Transporter 1,

04:10.792 --> 04:12.460
which means
we'll be completely lost.

04:12.586 --> 04:14.503
I doubt it.
Plus Jason Statham's physique...

04:14.588 --> 04:16.255
is nothing like the lineup
in Predator.

04:16.339 --> 04:18.841
Okay, stop. I don't want
to have conversations anymore...

04:18.926 --> 04:20.551
about dudes' physiques,
and whether they can...

04:20.636 --> 04:22.470
Dennis, in body mass alone...

04:22.554 --> 04:24.972
That's what I was trying to avoid-
a conversation about body mass, okay?

04:25.057 --> 04:27.391
We've had that conversation
five times a day for the last month...

04:27.476 --> 04:30.019
because we keep watching Predator,
and all you talk about is Weathers...

04:30.103 --> 04:33.064
and-and-and Jesse "the Body" Ventura
and how many pounds they can pack on.

04:33.148 --> 04:36.275
It's important to pack on mass.
You're talking about carbo-loading.

04:36.360 --> 04:38.110
I don't want to have this
conversation with you anymore.

04:38.195 --> 04:41.197
No. You'd rather have conversations
with video store clerks.

04:41.281 --> 04:44.116
You know what, man? If you don't want to
watch the movie with me, that's fine.

04:44.201 --> 04:46.327
I will watch it by myself.
Goddamn it!

04:46.411 --> 04:48.996
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Where is this coming from?

04:51.041 --> 04:55.044
I have been thinking a lot about
what Dee said, and I do think...

04:55.128 --> 04:59.215
[Exhales] maybe we are spending a
little bit too much time together.

04:59.299 --> 05:01.384
Wh-What are you saying?

05:01.468 --> 05:05.471
I'm saying that I feel like we're
in a little bit of a rut, and...

05:06.515 --> 05:09.141
I feel like I'm not...

05:10.143 --> 05:12.228
flourishing.

05:12.312 --> 05:18.275
[Clicks Tongue] Well, far
be it from me to, uh,

05:18.360 --> 05:21.404
keep the flower of you
from flourishing, but, uh,

05:21.530 --> 05:24.365
I guess I'll grab my shit and
stay at Charlie's. Wait.

05:26.034 --> 05:27.702
Don't do that.

05:27.786 --> 05:31.664
[Exhales] I... feel like I'm the
one that got us into this mess.

05:31.790 --> 05:35.001
Okay. So you'll stay
at Charlie's then. No.

05:36.128 --> 05:38.254
You should stay there...

05:38.338 --> 05:39.964
because you already said
that you would.

05:40.048 --> 05:41.716
Also, I have more stuff.

05:41.800 --> 05:44.885
It'll take me longer to
pack, and it'll be easier.

05:44.970 --> 05:47.722
[Doorbell Rings]

05:52.019 --> 05:54.937
Hi. I'm responding to a
missing persons report.

05:59.776 --> 06:01.944
I'll pack my things.

06:03.655 --> 06:07.241
- [Knocking]
- Hey!

06:07.325 --> 06:10.661
[Laughing]
Hey-oh!

06:10.746 --> 06:12.621
What's the matter with you?
What are you doing here?

06:12.706 --> 06:15.124
- I came to hang out with you.
- I thought it was movie night.

06:15.208 --> 06:18.419
Yeah, it is movie night. But, uh, Mac and
I are taking a little bit of a break.

06:18.503 --> 06:20.004
I was thinking about
what you were saying.

06:20.088 --> 06:21.881
You were right.
I wasn't spending enough time by myself.

06:21.965 --> 06:24.341
I wasn't being an independent individual.
I wasn't flourishing.

06:24.426 --> 06:26.010
So let's watch the movie
together, you and me.

06:26.136 --> 06:28.846
[Meowing] I'm kind of in the middle
of something with my cat right now.

06:28.930 --> 06:32.808
Oh. Okay. Well, yeah. I like cats.
Let's bring him into the mix.

06:32.893 --> 06:36.937
Uh, can't do that.
He is... in the wall somewhere.

06:37.022 --> 06:39.607
- He's in the wall? - Yeah.
I think he got into the wall.

06:39.733 --> 06:41.317
Wow. Well, that's a bummer.
[Meowing Continues]

06:41.401 --> 06:43.027
But I'm sure he'll come out
at some point.

06:43.111 --> 06:44.987
Got himself in there.
I'm sure he'll get himself out.

06:45.072 --> 06:48.324
Or he won't, and he'll die in there, and
you'll have a dead cat smell for a while.

06:48.408 --> 06:50.534
But listen, I'm gonna help you
out of that jam.

06:50.619 --> 06:53.454
Open the windows and get some
scented candles going,

06:53.538 --> 06:55.206
maybe get a big fan in here...

06:55.290 --> 06:58.459
and then he'll decompose
and everything will be fine.

06:58.543 --> 07:02.296
Boom! That's what it's like to have a sidekick.
Helped you out of a jam.

07:02.380 --> 07:04.381
[Meowing Continues]

07:04.466 --> 07:06.884
In the meantime, let's watch the movie.
I want to- I want to...

07:06.968 --> 07:09.887
[Exhales] Just want to watch a movie...
with you.

07:09.971 --> 07:11.972
Could we do that?

07:15.477 --> 07:18.395
Why don't you just put your
trash into a trash can?

07:18.480 --> 07:22.191
I put it in the trash can when I'm
ready to take it outside, dude.

07:22.275 --> 07:24.902
Yeah, but you could skip a step
by first putting it into the can.

07:24.986 --> 07:26.695
And you can
shut the hell up, man.

07:26.780 --> 07:29.949
Okay. And Jesus Christ, Frank.
Are you cutting your toenails with a steak knife?

07:30.033 --> 07:31.575
I suppose you have a problem
with that too?

07:31.660 --> 07:36.080
Ah! Oh! Oh! Botched toe!
I botched that one.

07:36.164 --> 07:38.541
Oh, that's a botch job.
That's bleeding.

07:38.625 --> 07:40.543
I need some trash
to plug up the cut.

07:40.627 --> 07:42.461
Do not plug an open wound
with trash.

07:42.546 --> 07:45.297
- Well, it's bleeding like a sieve.
- Then use your sock, bro.

07:45.423 --> 07:47.258
Don't waste a good sock on
a tiny little cut. Sock.

07:47.384 --> 07:49.593
I'll find you a candy wrapper
if you give me a second. Oh.

07:49.678 --> 07:52.513
Oh. Oh, wait a minute.

07:52.597 --> 07:55.224
That's- That's working.
Oh, it's acting like a cut glove.

07:55.308 --> 07:57.768
Ah! Unbelievable, dude.
Waste of a sock.

07:57.853 --> 08:01.313
There are so many things that are gonna
need to change now that I'm living here.

08:01.398 --> 08:03.023
Are you hearing this shit, bro?

08:03.150 --> 08:04.984
Well, you know, he's got
some good ideas. What?

08:05.068 --> 08:08.320
- Maybe it wouldn't be bad if he moved in.
- Are you serious, dude?

08:08.446 --> 08:10.447
I could use a little structure
in my life here. No, man.

08:10.574 --> 08:12.908
Look at all the trash all over the place.
Oh, I love the trash.

08:13.034 --> 08:14.535
He's cleaning up the trash.
Mmm...

08:14.619 --> 08:16.162
[Phone Ringing] I don't
want struc- [Groans]

08:16.246 --> 08:17.913
Uh- Eh-
Is that Dennis?

08:17.998 --> 08:20.374
I don't know who it is.
I haven't answered the phone.

08:20.500 --> 08:22.293
Are you gonna answer it though, because- Okay.
Unbelievable, dude.

08:22.377 --> 08:26.130
- I'm just gonna get it. Hello?
- Hey, buddy. How you doing?

08:26.256 --> 08:29.175
Oh, Mac is being annoying as shit.
That him?

08:29.259 --> 08:31.719
Oh, Mac's being annoying?
That's a big surprise.

08:31.845 --> 08:34.221
He bossing you around a whole bunch?
Totally bossing me around.

08:34.306 --> 08:38.392
Yeah. Typical. It's what he does.
It's what he does.

08:38.476 --> 08:40.936
- Did he mention me?
- No.

08:41.020 --> 08:44.398
No? Really? He didn't say
anything at all about me or...

08:44.482 --> 08:46.692
What is this, dude?
Did you call me just to talk about Mac?

08:46.818 --> 08:49.570
Okay, 'cause I don't want to talk about Mac with you.
Is he talking about me?

08:49.654 --> 08:53.032
-No, no, no, no. Tell him I'm not talking about him at all.
-I'm not telling him shit, dude.

08:53.158 --> 08:55.117
I'm gonna hang up the phone on you.
No, no, Charlie.

08:55.202 --> 08:58.162
Don't hang up the phone. I didn't call
to talk about Mac. I swear to God, dude.

08:58.246 --> 09:00.623
Please. Come on. I could care less about that guy.
Are you kidding me?

09:00.749 --> 09:03.918
Called to talk to you. Wanted to see if you
wanted to come over to Dee's apartment.

09:04.002 --> 09:05.794
- We're doing a movie night.
- Charlie, hang up the phone.

09:05.921 --> 09:07.963
Oh, my God, dude. I'll be right over.
Hang up the phone.

09:08.048 --> 09:10.007
Yes! Yeah! Yes!

09:10.091 --> 09:13.510
Yes. Yeah.

09:13.595 --> 09:15.596
Hey, Dee.
Charlie's coming over.

09:15.680 --> 09:17.473
I don't care.

09:17.557 --> 09:20.267
Ah, shit.
I don't care either.

09:23.730 --> 09:26.232
I am so excited to watch
this movie without Mac.

09:26.316 --> 09:29.818
He is so annoying. He's always constantly
critiquing the fight scenes...

09:29.903 --> 09:31.862
and talking about how he could
choreograph the fight scenes...

09:31.947 --> 09:33.697
so much better than they could,
which is ridiculous.

09:33.782 --> 09:36.700
- He doesn't know shit.
- Ooh! Dennis, I pinpointed him.

09:36.785 --> 09:38.953
Dee, will you forget the
goddamn cat for a second...

09:39.037 --> 09:41.080
and listen to all the interesting
things I have to say?

09:41.164 --> 09:42.873
You're being the worst
sidekick right now.

09:42.999 --> 09:44.708
No, you're being the worst sidekick.
[Meowing]

09:44.793 --> 09:47.169
I thought sidekicks were supposed
to help each other out of jams.

09:47.254 --> 09:49.046
What? I did
help you out of the jam.

09:49.130 --> 09:51.215
I told you what to do with
your dead, stinking cat.

09:51.299 --> 09:53.050
No, no, no, no, no.
Come on.

09:53.134 --> 09:56.136
Oh! I lost him. I lost him, Dennis.
Thanks a lot.

09:56.221 --> 09:59.306
Oh, do me a favor.
Peel this apple for me, please?

09:59.391 --> 10:02.726
No! No, I'm not
gonna peel an apple for you.

10:02.811 --> 10:04.520
But Mac always does it for me.

10:04.604 --> 10:06.188
Why does Mac
peel your apples for you?

10:06.273 --> 10:09.066
He doesn't like for me to eat
the apples with the skin on it.

10:09.150 --> 10:10.609
He says the skin's
loaded with toxins.

10:10.694 --> 10:12.152
Okay. Well, good news.
Mac's not here.

10:12.237 --> 10:15.072
I know he's not here, and that's
why I need you to do it for me.

10:15.156 --> 10:17.866
- Please? Please? - Oh, Jesus.
Just eat it with the skin on it.

10:17.951 --> 10:21.078
I do not like it with the skin, Dee!
I'm not allowed to eat it with the skin!

10:21.162 --> 10:22.788
- I'm not allowed!
- Oh, my God!

10:22.872 --> 10:24.540
All right.
If you just shut up,

10:24.624 --> 10:27.418
I will peel the apple for you the
way that Mac likes you to eat it.

10:27.502 --> 10:29.295
Give it to me.
Give it to me!

10:29.379 --> 10:31.714
I'll do it the way
that Mac insists. Okay?

10:31.798 --> 10:33.799
Yeah.

10:35.135 --> 10:38.220
Hey-oh! Is that Charlie?
Charlie's in the house!

10:38.305 --> 10:43.350
Charlie's in the house!
Hey! Hey!

10:43.476 --> 10:45.227
Hey, you want a skinless
apple, bud? Yup.

10:45.312 --> 10:49.398
Two skinless apples, Dee.
Let's fire the movie up. It's movie night.

10:49.482 --> 10:51.900
- Here's your apple, dick.
- All right. Yeah.

10:52.027 --> 10:54.194
Where's mine?
Are you kidding me?

10:54.321 --> 10:56.822
Mmm. You can peel your
own apple, Charlie.

10:56.906 --> 11:01.035
Mmm. She's in a little bit of a mood
because her cat got stuck in the wall.

11:01.119 --> 11:05.789
Cat in the wall, eh? Okay.
Now you're talking my language.

11:05.874 --> 11:08.417
I know this game. All right.
Catch me up to speed here.

11:08.543 --> 11:10.961
What do we got? You're putting
Cheeto fingers all over the wall.

11:11.046 --> 11:13.422
All right. Let's focus, Dee.
What's the point of entry here?

11:13.506 --> 11:16.550
That's the thing, Charlie. I've been looking all
around this goddamn place. I can't find one.

11:16.634 --> 11:18.635
All right. I've seen this before.
You know what happened?

11:18.720 --> 11:22.097
I bet it flattened itself out, went
right through a seam in your wall.

11:22.182 --> 11:25.225
I don't think there's anything in the
laws of nature that would support that.

11:25.352 --> 11:27.436
Cats do not abide by the laws
of nature, all right? Hey.

11:27.562 --> 11:29.980
You don't know shit about ca- We're
still gonna watch the movie, right?

11:30.065 --> 11:32.066
Uh- Uh, yeah.
Yeah?

11:32.192 --> 11:34.777
I think it's stuck in there.
No! It is not stuck.

11:34.861 --> 11:37.654
All right. Let's focus on what's
happening with the cat, all right?

11:37.739 --> 11:39.698
It made a conscious decision
to go in your wall. Correct?

11:39.824 --> 11:41.909
Really?
Absolutely. Absolutely.

11:41.993 --> 11:44.578
It chose to be in there.
It wants to be in your wall, Dee.

11:44.704 --> 11:47.331
Thinking about getting some catnip, and
I was gonna put it- No, no, no, no.

11:47.415 --> 11:49.875
Don't do that. Don't do that.
It's gonna know that's a trap, Dee. Okay?

11:49.959 --> 11:52.544
That's gonna irritate the cat, then
it's gonna dig itself down further.

11:52.670 --> 11:54.338
We may never get to it.
Okay? You serious?

11:54.422 --> 11:56.006
Let's start thinking
like a cat here. All right?

11:56.091 --> 11:57.925
You know, we-
we need another cat.

11:58.051 --> 11:59.843
Yes? That's what we need.
Here's what we're gonna do.

11:59.928 --> 12:02.471
I'm gonna crack a little hole in
your wall- Tiny one. It'll be cool.

12:02.555 --> 12:05.599
And then I'm gonna slip a second cat
in with a string tied around it.

12:05.683 --> 12:07.976
Those two will become codependent,
then I'll rip the second cat out,

12:08.103 --> 12:10.896
and the first one hopefully- hopefully
will follow. Hey, hey. Hey, man.

12:10.980 --> 12:14.024
Hey. I'm sorry. I don't mean to keep bugging
you, but you didn't tell me what to do.

12:14.150 --> 12:16.777
I don't care. Do you want me to
start it now or wait? I'll wait.

12:16.903 --> 12:19.446
Yeah. Start it. But I want to
watch it with you. I will wait.

12:19.531 --> 12:21.657
Just start the movie, man, 'cause
I'm having a conversation here!

12:21.741 --> 12:23.325
- All day.
- [Mouths Word]

12:23.451 --> 12:26.412
All right. Where are we gonna get this other cat?
I can get you another cat.

12:26.496 --> 12:28.122
I got followed here
by, like, 10 cats.

12:28.248 --> 12:30.707
Yeah, they're starting to
follow me these days. Uh-I...

12:30.792 --> 12:32.793
You know, I don't want you
to miss the setup.

12:32.877 --> 12:35.087
[Mouths Words]

12:35.171 --> 12:39.758
I got everything- all the groceries,
no cat food. [Chuckles]

12:39.843 --> 12:42.469
And I bumped into
that guy at the video store.

12:42.554 --> 12:45.806
- Beefcake?
- Total jerk-off.

12:45.890 --> 12:47.850
[Exhales] Nice.

12:47.934 --> 12:51.478
- Hey! This place is tits!
- Yeah, right? Looks good.

12:51.604 --> 12:53.021
Huh? You did a great job.
Thank you.

12:53.148 --> 12:55.691
Whoa! Frank! No, no!
Oh, God, dude! What?

12:55.775 --> 12:58.152
The skin of those things
is riddled with toxins!

12:58.236 --> 13:00.612
[Groans]
Yeah, get it out though.

13:00.738 --> 13:02.990
Get it all out.
Yuck! [Spitting]

13:03.116 --> 13:05.576
Whoo! That was a close call.
Good save.

13:05.660 --> 13:07.327
Hey, all right.
Well, don't touch me with it.

13:07.412 --> 13:08.996
Hey, also-
I cleaned out this closet.

13:09.080 --> 13:11.457
I'm telling you, bro, we could
fit a mattress in there.

13:11.541 --> 13:13.917
You and Charlie don't have to
sleep next to each other anymore.

13:14.002 --> 13:18.005
Well, I- I kind of liked the other
arrangement though. That was pretty good.

13:18.131 --> 13:22.301
[Chuckles] Yeah. The other arrangement
was- was not pretty good.

13:22.385 --> 13:24.761
It was, um...

13:24.846 --> 13:27.014
It was, uh- What- What's
the word I'm looking for?

13:27.098 --> 13:29.892
- Crazy. - No, it's not- not crazy.
It's like...

13:29.976 --> 13:33.061
- Wackadoo.
- No. Just... stop.

13:33.146 --> 13:34.688
Whoa! Wh-What-
What are you doing now, dude?

13:34.772 --> 13:36.940
What? I'm taking
the toxic skin off.

13:37.025 --> 13:39.067
Yeah, but you're cutting it
with your toe knife.

13:39.152 --> 13:41.069
- Who gives a shit?
- Frank, that is disgusting.

13:41.196 --> 13:43.572
What- What are you talking about?
I'm throwing it out.

13:43.656 --> 13:45.866
- Wait. You're throwing my toe knife out?
- The toe knife is gone.

13:45.950 --> 13:49.119
- Why would you do that?
- Because you were cutting your fruit with it!

13:49.204 --> 13:51.914
What the hell's going on here?
Look, Mac. I mean, look. I...

13:51.998 --> 13:55.292
I think the cleaning up and the throwing
the trash away is good, but the...

13:55.376 --> 13:57.794
you know, the sleeping
arrangements and the plastic...

13:57.879 --> 14:00.130
and throwing the toe knife
out the window, that's...

14:00.215 --> 14:02.716
I'm not gonna put on airs
just because I got company.

14:02.800 --> 14:07.304
- So you think not eating cat food
is putting on airs? - You betcha!

14:07.388 --> 14:10.599
Look, I gotta take a walk.
My head is swimming.

14:10.725 --> 14:12.935
That's fine. Just make sure you,
you know, check in. Oh, my.

14:13.019 --> 14:15.521
'Cause I haven't heard from
Charlie, and it is getting late.

14:15.605 --> 14:17.314
- Yeah, right.
- Okay. Be safe.

14:17.398 --> 14:18.398
[Door Closes]

14:20.527 --> 14:24.988
[Movie On TV, Indistinct]

14:25.073 --> 14:28.659
Okay, Dee! This little lady
is a calico cat.

14:28.785 --> 14:30.369
All calico cats are female.
[Meowing]

14:30.495 --> 14:32.996
I'm gonna pop this little girl in your wall here.
[Growling, Hissing]

14:33.081 --> 14:36.416
She's gonna meet your little
fella, they're gonna bond...

14:36.501 --> 14:39.419
and then I'm gonna rip her out and
he's gonna come right afterwards.

14:39.546 --> 14:40.712
Are you sure?
Mm-hmm.

14:40.838 --> 14:41.797
[Growling] You hear that?

14:41.881 --> 14:43.674
Uh, I hear a squabble.

14:43.800 --> 14:45.717
Mm-hmm. It's all part of the dance, okay?
[Screeching, Hissing]

14:45.802 --> 14:48.595
They do a little sq- Come on. Wait.
Hold on. They do a little...

14:48.680 --> 14:50.556
Uh-oh.
[Clicks Tongue] Crap.

14:50.682 --> 14:52.224
Thanks a lot, Charlie.
Mmm.

14:52.308 --> 14:54.226
Goddamn it. I knew
I should've gotten a bird.

14:54.352 --> 14:56.186
A bird? What are you gonna
do with a bird? Yeah!

14:56.271 --> 14:58.730
Hey, guys!
I swallowed apple seeds!

14:58.815 --> 15:00.399
So what?
Are they poisonous?

15:00.483 --> 15:02.109
Are you kidding me, dude?
They're extremely poisonous!

15:02.235 --> 15:04.820
They're absolutely not poisonous!
Should I make myself throw up?

15:04.946 --> 15:07.781
I would throw up now!
Oh, goddamn it!

15:07.907 --> 15:10.158
Apple seeds, man? That's no good.
Are you kidding me?

15:10.285 --> 15:11.910
Apple seeds- Yo!
Hey.

15:12.036 --> 15:14.496
Oh, hi. Come on in.
[Exhales]

15:14.581 --> 15:17.124
So, uh, how's life with Mac?

15:17.208 --> 15:18.792
I'm off him.
He's too pushy.

15:18.876 --> 15:20.836
Yeah, no shit.
You back on my team?

15:20.920 --> 15:23.088
If there's room for me.

15:23.172 --> 15:25.340
There is always room
for you, bud. Give it to me.

15:25.425 --> 15:29.720
[Both Grunting, Laughing]

15:29.804 --> 15:31.305
[Dennis] Hey, guys!
I can't throw up.

15:31.389 --> 15:33.807
Should I stick a finger down my throat?
Yes! Oh, my God.

15:33.933 --> 15:35.434
You guys, we gotta-
[Retching]

15:35.518 --> 15:37.644
Oh, man. We gotta get Mac and
Dennis back together, okay?

15:37.729 --> 15:39.146
Because they are ruining
all of our lives.

15:39.272 --> 15:40.981
What's the situation?
[Retching Continues]

15:41.065 --> 15:43.734
I got two cats stuck inside this wall.
Can't get 'em out.

15:43.860 --> 15:45.777
You want to bring in a third?
I'm thinking maybe four.

15:45.862 --> 15:48.488
- What? No! No! No!
No more cats! - A deep hole...

15:48.615 --> 15:51.033
Frank, get out of here! You're making it worse!
Whoa. Back off Frank.

15:51.159 --> 15:52.951
We work very well together, okay?
We're the gruesome twosome!

15:53.036 --> 15:54.536
Gruesome twosome!

15:54.621 --> 15:58.123
[Braying, Grunting]

16:00.627 --> 16:03.420
All right! Okay! I am gonna go and
get Mac and Dennis back together.

16:03.504 --> 16:05.964
I'm gonna get a bird, I'm gonna
get two cats out of my wall...

16:06.049 --> 16:07.674
and then I'm gonna
go back to being alone.

16:07.759 --> 16:09.468
Excuse me.
Can you part for one second?

16:09.594 --> 16:11.136
Sure.
Thank you. Thank you.

16:11.220 --> 16:12.929
[Retching Continues]

16:13.056 --> 16:14.556
What?
He swallowed some apple seeds.

16:28.112 --> 16:29.738
Sit down.
What...

16:29.822 --> 16:32.324
- What-
- Sit.

16:32.408 --> 16:34.326
What is he doing here?

16:34.410 --> 16:37.287
I was told I would be meeting
a woman with giant breasts.

16:37.372 --> 16:41.041
I was also told that I was to
meet a woman with giant breasts.

16:41.125 --> 16:42.626
Yes, geniuses. I set you up.

16:42.710 --> 16:44.836
Now, can you please make up, because
you're driving everyone crazy.

16:44.921 --> 16:47.756
Look, I'm sorry that
I called you codependent, okay?

16:47.840 --> 16:49.424
I think you have
a great friendship,

16:49.509 --> 16:52.552
and it's perfectly natural for two grown
men to need each other this badly.

16:52.637 --> 16:54.221
So make up, please.

16:54.305 --> 16:57.140
[Sighs] I guess I should...

16:57.266 --> 17:00.310
[Grunts] [Grunts]

17:00.436 --> 17:03.605
You son of a bitch!
Okay. All right. Okay.

17:03.690 --> 17:06.400
Oh, my God.
You know what? Fine.

17:06.483 --> 17:08.193
I don't care anymore.
Guess what?

17:08.277 --> 17:10.987
Neither one of you are ever going
into my apartment ever again, okay?

17:11.071 --> 17:13.448
So make up, don't make up,
kill each other- I don't care.

17:13.532 --> 17:15.367
I need to go get a bird.

17:17.829 --> 17:19.954
She looks like a bird.

17:20.039 --> 17:21.957
[Chuckles]

17:26.713 --> 17:28.588
I swallowed
some apple seeds today.

17:28.673 --> 17:30.841
Did you make yourself throw up?

17:30.925 --> 17:33.468
I tried, but I couldn't.

17:33.553 --> 17:39.266
Smoke some cigarettes. The smoke will
suffocate the bacteria in your stomach.

17:41.018 --> 17:43.520
Okay. Thanks.

17:43.604 --> 17:45.522
How was Charlie's?

17:45.606 --> 17:47.190
[Groans]

17:47.275 --> 17:49.609
The way they live, bro, it's...

17:49.736 --> 17:53.029
It's like, um- It's
like- Preposterous.

17:53.156 --> 17:54.781
Yeah, dude!
Preposterous! Yeah.

17:54.907 --> 17:57.617
I've been trying to come up
with that all day! Yeah.

17:57.702 --> 18:00.912
God, dude! This is why you and I
are such a good team. You know?

18:00.997 --> 18:04.291
Like, I'm a man of action, and you're
a man that comes up with good...

18:04.417 --> 18:06.334
Words?
Words, dude!

18:06.419 --> 18:08.253
Okay. Yeah.
Great.

18:08.337 --> 18:09.880
You really gotta work
on your vocabulary though, man.

18:10.006 --> 18:12.299
Well, you could help me.
You couldn't think of the word "words."

18:12.383 --> 18:13.717
Is everything okay
here, gentlemen?

18:13.801 --> 18:16.970
Uh, yeah. Everything's fine.
Uh, not that it concerns you.

18:17.054 --> 18:20.348
Now might be a good time for you
to pay your bill and leave.

18:20.433 --> 18:22.642
Well, you're not making sense
'cause we didn't buy anything.

18:22.769 --> 18:24.352
Actually, I-
Oh.

18:24.437 --> 18:27.564
- I had a couple of rum and Cokes.
- You had six, actually.

18:27.690 --> 18:29.357
Six?
I had six of 'em.

18:29.484 --> 18:31.985
Did you? Yeah. I was nervous
about the big-breasted lady.

18:32.111 --> 18:34.154
I- I was nervous about her too.
You got nervous too?

18:34.280 --> 18:36.281
A beautiful woman.
Dee said she had giant boobs, you know?

18:36.365 --> 18:37.407
I'm really excited about it.

18:37.492 --> 18:39.159
[Clears Throat]
Will that be cash or charge?

18:39.243 --> 18:43.747
I also was assuming that the big-breasted
lady was gonna pay for the drinks,

18:43.831 --> 18:45.540
so I don't have any money.

18:45.625 --> 18:50.045
I've got some cash.
I can- I can get you out of this jam.

19:05.520 --> 19:06.978
[Bird Chirping]

19:07.063 --> 19:09.564
[All Meowing]

19:10.983 --> 19:12.484
Watch your eyes.
What?

19:12.568 --> 19:14.903
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
What the hell is going on?

19:14.987 --> 19:16.488
The gruesome twosome in effect!

19:16.572 --> 19:19.449
[Grunting, Braying]

19:19.534 --> 19:21.201
Yeah. We're bashing
a bigger hole in your wall.

19:21.285 --> 19:23.912
- We're gonna stuff all the cats in at one time.
- Yeah, I see that.

19:23.996 --> 19:27.040
No more big holes in my wall, no more cats.
We're doing the bird thing.

19:27.124 --> 19:30.710
I got one. I tied a string around his teeny,
tiny little legs. I'm sending it in.

19:30.837 --> 19:33.129
You're gonna toss a bird in?
I'm gonna toss the bird in, Charlie.

19:33.214 --> 19:35.257
- Go ahead, Dee. Toss the bird in.
- Check this out. Watch this.

19:35.383 --> 19:36.800
[Frank] Dinner time.
Go on, guy.

19:36.926 --> 19:38.385
Do your thing.
[Charlie] All right.

19:38.511 --> 19:39.928
[Meowing]
Go on. You got it.

19:40.054 --> 19:41.763
[Screeching] Whoa! Hold on.
Hold on. Hold on, guy.

19:41.848 --> 19:44.307
I got you. Wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait!

19:44.433 --> 19:46.434
Come on.
[Meowing]

19:46.519 --> 19:49.020
[Charlie Laughs]
Well, congratulations, Dee.

19:49.105 --> 19:51.356
You have some very satisfied
cats in there, okay?

19:51.440 --> 19:53.817
Now will you step aside
and let the men do the work?

19:53.901 --> 19:57.320
Shut up! Shut up, okay? I got it from here, all right?
I'm bashing a hole in my wall.

19:57.405 --> 19:59.614
I'm going in myself. Give me this.
Get out of the way.

19:59.740 --> 20:01.783
All right. I'm not kidding.
Get the hell out of the way.

20:01.909 --> 20:03.785
Oh. I'm dead serious.
I'm going in. I've had enough.

20:03.870 --> 20:05.787
Go for it.
Bash away. Bash away.

20:05.913 --> 20:09.666
[Shouting] [Frank] Whoa!
Oh!

20:09.750 --> 20:12.419
- I'm gonna get you, you jerk!
- Yeah! Yeah, Deandra!

20:12.503 --> 20:15.839
[Panting] Come on, kitty.

20:15.965 --> 20:18.341
[Meowing]
Oh. Come on.

20:18.426 --> 20:21.636
Okay. I'll get you.
I'll get you.

20:21.721 --> 20:23.346
Wait- Oh.

20:23.431 --> 20:25.223
Wow! There are
a lot of cats back here!

20:25.349 --> 20:27.475
Yeah. We put a lot of cats in there.
[Cell Phone Rings]

20:27.602 --> 20:29.936
Oh, I'm getting a text.
Ooh. Who is it?

20:30.062 --> 20:32.647
Ah, the dynamic duo in effect.
Oh, they're back together!

20:32.773 --> 20:34.274
[Chuckles] Yeah.
All right.

20:34.358 --> 20:35.859
They're watching Predator.
You want to join?

20:35.943 --> 20:37.360
Absolutely, dude.
Great.

20:37.486 --> 20:38.945
Deandra, we're out of here.
Yeah.

20:39.071 --> 20:40.614
Hey, you guys?
We're going.

20:40.740 --> 20:42.824
Yeah? You guys, I think
I'm stuck in the wall.

20:42.950 --> 20:45.410
That's why she needs a friend.
You gotta have a sidekick.

20:45.494 --> 20:47.329
That's all I'm saying.
That's all I'm saying.

20:47.413 --> 20:50.165
All right- Oops. Okay, I'm trying to back
out, but my shirt's caught on something.

20:50.291 --> 20:52.500
[Cats Screeching, Hissing]
Guys?

20:52.585 --> 20:55.086
Guys?
Guys, come on!
