00:01.700 --> 00:03.566
Some plot, some scheme, some lie.

00:03.567 --> 00:05.533
Your family is sick!

00:05.534 --> 00:07.699
Now you can't even give me
a son, what's the point?

00:07.700 --> 00:09.833
- You don't mean that.
- I do.

00:09.834 --> 00:12.699
I wanted my own son. We can't have one.

00:12.700 --> 00:14.500

a parcel at reception

00:19.867 --> 00:21.499

I'm afraid I can't do that.

take a very dim view

00:25.500 --> 00:27.966
of your sodomite activities.

00:27.967 --> 00:30.032
Thank you so very much.

00:30.033 --> 00:32.633
This has to be the last time.

00:32.634 --> 00:36.000
The last time is my call, not yours.

birthday party in Sydney.

00:50.200 --> 00:51.000
Mostly our kind.

00:51.001 --> 00:55.633
Your kind of "our kind" aren't my kind.

00:55.634 --> 00:57.099
Suppose you wrote a novel.

00:57.100 --> 00:59.366
Death by poison of a young schoolteacher

00:59.367 --> 01:00.966
and the story surrounding it.

01:00.967 --> 01:04.065
Names and places changed, but
sufficient to the purpose.

01:04.066 --> 01:07.767
We will hang Regina's good name
even if we can't hang Regina.

01:09.667 --> 01:12.499
This is a vicious exercise
in character assassin!

01:12.500 --> 01:14.499
What if I told you it's all true?

01:14.500 --> 01:17.032
You're telling me that Regina
killed the young Davis woman

01:17.033 --> 01:18.132
in trying to poison Sarah?

01:18.133 --> 01:18.966
Yes.

01:18.967 --> 01:21.065
Has George seen this?

01:21.066 --> 01:22.699
If he reads this...

01:22.700 --> 01:25.766
if anyone does beyond your
malicious inner cabal...

01:25.767 --> 01:28.966
I will reveal every sordid truth I know!

would hurt a child.

With pleasure.

01:35.500 --> 01:36.666
She's played me.

01:36.667 --> 01:39.165
I need to stare that truth in the face

01:39.166 --> 01:41.599
and see her where she belongs.

01:41.600 --> 01:43.199
So it's done.

01:43.200 --> 01:44.599
It is.

back by this evening.

02:01.333 --> 02:02.833
DOUGLAS: What would you
like us to do here?

02:02.834 --> 02:04.900
GEORGE: Just go about your
day as if nothing's wrong.

02:04.901 --> 02:07.366
Regina's to suspect nothing untoward.

02:07.367 --> 02:09.532
But surely we need to know
what you're planning, George.

02:09.533 --> 02:11.132
The less you know about
my plans, Mother,

02:11.133 --> 02:12.699
the easier it will be for you to behave

02:12.700 --> 02:14.099
as if Regina has won the day.

02:14.100 --> 02:17.966
But you do intend to deal
with her once and for all?

02:17.967 --> 02:19.066
Yes.

02:20.700 --> 02:21.767
I've been blind.

02:23.100 --> 02:24.866
I'm the fool who married her after all.

02:24.867 --> 02:27.065
Well, I'm the fool who brought
her back into the house,

02:27.066 --> 02:28.966
so don't you feel guilty, George.

02:28.967 --> 02:32.599
But having caught the tiger,
it must first be defanged.

02:32.600 --> 02:34.433
Precisely.

02:37.567 --> 02:38.633
And as we're being observed,

02:38.634 --> 02:41.600

interest in my roses, shall we?

planning to attend...

03:14.267 --> 03:17.833
What sort of affair is it exactly?

03:17.834 --> 03:19.132
I'm not sure.

03:19.133 --> 03:22.133
The sort of party that the
police would want to raid?

03:24.700 --> 03:26.566
Regina could have a
private detective on him

03:26.567 --> 03:27.666
for all we know.

03:27.667 --> 03:30.666
I will try Henry again
once we get to town.

03:30.667 --> 03:33.165
The main thing is to get
there, locate them,

03:33.166 --> 03:35.100
and make sure they behave impeccably.

03:36.834 --> 03:38.500
I will do my best.

I'll be back this evening.

04:10.033 --> 04:11.867
I wonder if I shouldn't come.

04:12.867 --> 04:14.667

up to before she left?

04:33.901 --> 04:35.833
She was looking for Mr.
Bligh's address book.

The little pink one, no doubt.

04:37.967 --> 04:39.432

Still on her constitutional, ma'am.

once in the <i>National Geographic</i>

older male elephants,

get pushed out of the herd.

13:17.867 --> 13:20.366
The host's very upset.
Everyone's on edge.

13:20.367 --> 13:21.866
He's a friend.

13:21.867 --> 13:23.366
I didn't think anyone would mind.

13:23.367 --> 13:26.266
You know this setup.

13:26.267 --> 13:29.232
Everyone knows each other.
They trust each other.

13:29.233 --> 13:31.666
Perhaps if you returned my phone
calls, I could have asked.

13:31.667 --> 13:34.866
Stop being such a boor.

13:34.867 --> 13:37.299
I've got enough pressure
going on without this,

13:37.300 --> 13:39.033
so just sort it out.

13:45.500 --> 13:48.099
I know how much you're needed
at the hospital, Doris.

13:48.100 --> 13:50.900
I don't want to take up your whole day.

13:50.901 --> 13:54.766
Mr. Briggs ordered me not
to leave until he returned.

13:54.767 --> 13:55.699
He ordered me.

13:55.700 --> 13:58.232
Why didn't you say? I'm fine.

13:58.233 --> 14:01.499
I've got Lucky, and I've got...
I've got this.

14:01.500 --> 14:03.099
Oh, goodness me.

14:03.100 --> 14:07.065
Oh, Roy thought he saw a brown
snake yesterday, that's all.

14:07.066 --> 14:11.099
Have you ever used a
firearm, Sister Nordmann?

14:11.100 --> 14:15.633
Oh, I mean, I think I could if I had to.

14:15.634 --> 14:17.333
(VEHICLE APPROACHING)

14:19.100 --> 14:21.667
Oh, that's probably him now.

14:38.267 --> 14:42.900
Oh, I do wish that Mr. Briggs
would install a telephone.

14:42.901 --> 14:44.799
I've been wanting to
talk to you all morning.

14:44.800 --> 14:46.666
I... I won't stay long.

14:46.667 --> 14:50.065
No, no. You're very welcome.

14:50.066 --> 14:51.666
Thank you.

14:51.667 --> 14:54.432
Well, our plan worked.

14:54.433 --> 14:56.165
Magnificently.

14:56.166 --> 14:57.599
Your proof absolute.

14:57.600 --> 14:59.266
George told me of the threats.

14:59.267 --> 15:01.332
I'm so sorry you had to endure them.

15:01.333 --> 15:02.299
(CHUCKLES)

15:02.300 --> 15:04.232
Well, they were imaginative,
to say the least.

15:04.233 --> 15:06.099
Even Douglas was on the receiving end.

15:06.100 --> 15:09.332
- Yes.
- We're all rather on edge.

15:09.333 --> 15:12.499
Was George any clearer on how
he was going to proceed?

15:12.500 --> 15:13.966
Thank you.

15:13.967 --> 15:16.499
He would prefer none of
us know the details,

15:16.500 --> 15:18.499
so that when we cross paths with her,

15:18.500 --> 15:20.499
it's just an ordinary day.

15:20.500 --> 15:22.499
It's easy for me. I'm
not leaving the house.

15:22.500 --> 15:24.366
But you are making sure
the door is locked.

15:24.367 --> 15:26.266
Roy won't be long.

15:26.267 --> 15:28.432
Well, in any case,
she's up to her elbows

15:28.433 --> 15:29.599
organizing a luncheon.

15:29.600 --> 15:32.900
I must make sure the invitations
don't go out in the post.

15:32.901 --> 15:35.766
Well, this time tomorrow,

15:35.767 --> 15:39.065
George will have shut the
lid on Pandora's box.

15:39.066 --> 15:40.667
I wonder how...

15:41.834 --> 15:43.700
different we'll all feel.

15:46.166 --> 15:50.199
Jack described it as a
megalomania of sorts,

15:50.200 --> 15:52.966
a condition seeded years ago.

15:52.967 --> 15:55.833
A fierce sibling jealousy of Elaine

15:55.834 --> 15:57.466
for winning George's heart.

15:57.467 --> 16:00.266
Or it started in early childhood.

16:00.267 --> 16:02.165
None of which makes it any easier

16:02.166 --> 16:03.900
to be on the receiving end.

16:03.901 --> 16:06.499
Oh!

16:06.500 --> 16:08.233
I almost forgot.

16:12.333 --> 16:14.366
(LAUGHS)

16:14.367 --> 16:15.333
George?

16:16.500 --> 16:19.499
Is there a slight
resemblance there to David?

16:19.500 --> 16:21.165
(BABY CRIES)

16:21.166 --> 16:23.099

16:23.100 --> 16:25.499
It always feels like feeding time.

16:25.500 --> 16:28.633
Well, I should stay until Mr.
Briggs comes back.

16:28.634 --> 16:30.867
He'll be back soon, I promise.

16:33.033 --> 16:35.432
How would you feel about
having a little hold?

16:35.433 --> 16:37.500
Back in a moment.

17:07.634 --> 17:10.499
What news, Sergeant?

17:10.500 --> 17:11.767
I wonder.

17:43.200 --> 17:46.065
So these protection blokes with
the prime minister's office

17:46.066 --> 17:48.000
have come in handy.

17:48.001 --> 17:51.266
This Communist cell, the
Soviet teaching place,

17:51.267 --> 17:53.032
it's only about 15 miles from here.

17:53.033 --> 17:55.065
So close.

17:55.066 --> 17:56.966
And?

17:56.967 --> 18:00.065
I've got a woman in the post
office monitoring her mail.

18:00.066 --> 18:02.733
Quite a bit from someone
going by Aunt Peg.

18:02.734 --> 18:05.065
- Possibly code.
- It would be.

18:05.066 --> 18:07.633
All of her relatives are dead and gone.

18:07.634 --> 18:09.499
Well, these Canberra
blokes support our theory,

18:09.500 --> 18:10.499
but without solid proof...

18:10.500 --> 18:12.132
Oh, for the love of God!

18:12.133 --> 18:14.533
Someone should just run her
and the brat off the road

18:14.534 --> 18:15.901
and be done with it!

18:19.267 --> 18:22.266
I'm still scared for my life.

18:22.267 --> 18:23.667
How fortunate...

18:25.166 --> 18:27.567
to have you to protect me.

18:30.333 --> 18:33.499
Are you exhausted from
all your investigations?

18:33.500 --> 18:36.132
You must be.

18:36.133 --> 18:38.367
All in the line of duty.

19:33.667 --> 19:34.666
GORDON: Excuse me.

19:34.667 --> 19:37.500
I seem to have taken a wrong turn.

19:41.333 --> 19:43.699
When you get back to our gate,

19:43.700 --> 19:46.065
you turn left and just follow that road,

19:46.066 --> 19:49.166
um, for about, I don't
know, three or four miles.

19:50.767 --> 19:51.933
You lived here long?

19:51.934 --> 19:53.833
A while.

19:53.834 --> 19:57.499
I'm here doing some writing
for the <i>Socialist Worker.</i>

19:57.500 --> 19:58.933

19:58.934 --> 20:00.499
There's been some trouble
with the Blighs.

20:00.500 --> 20:03.499
Poor conditions, below the awards.

20:03.500 --> 20:05.232
That the sort of thing you hear?

20:05.233 --> 20:07.232
I work at the hospital.

20:07.233 --> 20:10.232
They seem very well looked
after during the season.

20:10.233 --> 20:12.366
Big wool profits this year.

20:12.367 --> 20:14.499
There's no excuse to shaft
the workers, is there?

20:14.500 --> 20:16.766
Anything you say would
be off the record.

20:16.767 --> 20:18.666
You really should speak to them.

20:18.667 --> 20:19.866
They're a good family.

20:19.867 --> 20:23.499
Still landed gentry,
though, aren't they?

20:23.500 --> 20:25.500
How do I put this? Um...

20:26.433 --> 20:29.065
Not everyone here votes Country Party.

20:29.066 --> 20:32.266
Even the rusted-on Labor voters
were behind George Bligh.

20:32.267 --> 20:33.766
Did you support him?

20:33.767 --> 20:34.901
Yes, I did, actually.

20:37.467 --> 20:38.967
But what's this really about?

20:40.800 --> 20:42.901
- Just doing my job.
- Which is what?

20:45.834 --> 20:46.800
It's okay.

21:00.367 --> 21:03.132
So Papa and I thought here might go

21:03.133 --> 21:04.733
what they call the <i>camera di provare...</i>

21:04.734 --> 21:06.633
you know, a tasting room.

21:06.634 --> 21:08.332
Like a little hut where
they can taste the wine

21:08.333 --> 21:10.032
before they buy it.

21:10.033 --> 21:14.499
And the straw wrapping on the
wine bottles... I saw all that.

21:14.500 --> 21:19.566
Gino, this health situation with Anna.

21:19.567 --> 21:22.733
Obviously she and I
have talked about it.

21:22.734 --> 21:25.499
At least you're honest
enough to tell me.

21:25.500 --> 21:26.867
We'll sort it out.

21:29.433 --> 21:32.800
Not even Anna knows what
I'm about to tell you.

21:40.166 --> 21:42.666

21:42.667 --> 21:44.000
What about Anna?

21:44.001 --> 21:45.232
I won't go into details,

21:45.233 --> 21:46.900
but it's something that
happened in the war.

21:46.901 --> 21:49.032
I thought the best thing would be

21:49.033 --> 21:51.066
if I just never loved a woman again.

21:53.267 --> 21:55.566
I nearly lost Caro for
good because of that.

21:55.567 --> 21:57.432
So Carolyn knew this
when she married you?

21:57.433 --> 21:58.767
Of course.

22:01.300 --> 22:03.633
Marriage is about family.

22:03.634 --> 22:05.666
There's no point doing it
if you can't have children.

22:05.667 --> 22:08.499
Plenty of happy couples
can't have children.

22:08.500 --> 22:10.300
- Or they adopt.
- I don't believe in that.

22:11.500 --> 22:14.633
Anyway, you've got Anna.
It's not the same.

22:14.634 --> 22:19.300
Just make sure you and Anna
don't close down like I did.

22:23.967 --> 22:25.833
I'm not gonna leave Anna or anything,

22:25.834 --> 22:26.700
if that's what you think.

think I'm rough trade.

No one was geeing you up.

28:33.934 --> 28:35.733
Problem with all of that

28:35.734 --> 28:37.099
is the last couple of days

28:37.100 --> 28:40.533
I've been watching
Nordmann very closely.

28:43.300 --> 28:44.733
The wealthiest family in the district

28:44.734 --> 28:45.766
are in and out of her place,

28:45.767 --> 28:47.099

28:47.100 --> 28:48.534
They're all Commies, are they?

28:52.066 --> 28:54.766
You should just head off now, mate.

28:54.767 --> 28:59.232

announcement or something,

for Nordmann to be dead.

- To give you some answers.

here, then you are too.

One day she may stand trial,
but first things first,

29:51.667 --> 29:53.666
I want to deal with the
fact that she's...

29:53.667 --> 29:56.866
well, she's mentally unhinged.

29:56.867 --> 30:00.533
Apart from all that, the woman
needs protecting from herself.

30:00.534 --> 30:02.499

been my attitude once.

reporters out of the courtroom

30:14.367 --> 30:15.699
if she goes to trial.

30:15.700 --> 30:17.966
By that stage she would have
been committed for some time.

30:17.967 --> 30:21.032
Her views on the family will
be seen through that prism.

are the basis of my political career.

I don't know.

33:24.233 --> 33:26.432
