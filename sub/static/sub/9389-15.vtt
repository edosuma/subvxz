It seems today that all you see

00:04.880 --> 00:07.966
Is violence in movies and sex on TV

00:08.217 --> 00:11.678
But where are those
Good old-fashioned values

00:11.803 --> 00:14.348
ALL: On which we used to rely?

00:14.932 --> 00:17.851
Lucky there's a family guy

00:18.352 --> 00:21.605
Lucky there's a man who positively can do

00:21.730 --> 00:23.148

00:35.452 --> 00:38.539
Hi, it's me, Peter, your TV cartoon pal.

00:38.622 --> 00:41.208
You know, Lois has been bitching lately
that I watch too much TV

00:41.291 --> 00:42.501
and don't read enough books.

00:42.584 --> 00:44.670
So, I went to the library
and picked up three books

00:44.753 --> 00:47.589
by the greatest author
of the last thousand years:

00:47.673 --> 00:49.174
Stephen King.

00:49.258 --> 00:51.301
And tonight, I'd like
to share them with you.

00:51.468 --> 00:54.054
We begin with a little tale
called "Stand By Me,"

00:54.263 --> 00:57.015
about four young boys
who went looking for a dead body

00:57.099 --> 00:59.226
and instead found themselves.

01:00.310 --> 01:01.854
And also a dead body.

01:05.315 --> 01:07.651
The year was 1955.

01:07.776 --> 01:10.320
And the voice in my head
was that of Richard Dreyfuss.

01:10.404 --> 01:13.740
RICHARD DREYFUSS: I never had friends
like the ones I had when I was 12.

01:13.824 --> 01:15.659
There was me, Petey LeChance...

01:15.742 --> 01:18.495
Anyone else fed up with this
oversaturation of media?

01:18.579 --> 01:20.581
Three channels and still nothing on.

01:20.664 --> 01:22.124
DREYFUSS: Then there was Joey Duchamps.

01:22.332 --> 01:24.293
The voice in his head was Roy Scheider.

01:24.376 --> 01:25.586
ROY SCHEIDER: How are you, Richard?

01:25.669 --> 01:26.879
DREYFUSS: Fine, Roy, how are you?

01:26.962 --> 01:28.255
SCHEIDER: Good, good.

01:28.338 --> 01:30.632
We should grab a drink sometime
and catch up,

01:30.716 --> 01:32.301
maybe reminisce about Jaws.

01:32.384 --> 01:34.428
DREYFUSS: Great, you should
give mea call sometime.

01:34.511 --> 01:35.971
My number's 555...

01:36.180 --> 01:39.641
SCHEIDER: Wait, wait. What? 555?
DREYFUSS: Uh, yeah.

01:39.725 --> 01:40.934
SCHEIDER: You know what, Richard,

01:41.018 --> 01:42.728
if you don't want to have drinks,
just say so.

01:42.811 --> 01:44.271
You don't have to be a dick about it.

01:44.354 --> 01:46.690
Oh, please, make the voices stop!

01:47.107 --> 01:49.026
DREYFUSS: And then
there wasQuag Chambers.

01:49.109 --> 01:50.903
He was the leader of our gang.

01:51.069 --> 01:52.654
He had sex when he was five

01:52.738 --> 01:54.615
and committed his first rape
when he was ten.

01:54.698 --> 01:56.825

DREYFUSS: Finally, there was Cleve Brown,
my pudgy, Black friend.

02:06.502 --> 02:09.546
I can still see him now,
all pudgy and Black.

02:09.838 --> 02:11.965

we're busy looking at Playboy.

02:12.049 --> 02:14.092

starve themselves.
