Um... yeah.

-Well, yes, but see...

Actually, I can't talk about it.
I'm too upset.

01:16.479 --> 01:17.520
Hmm.

01:18.160 --> 01:19.360
I'm really sorry, Ollie, but--

01:19.520 --> 01:21.720
We'll talk after my nubby-wubby superball

01:29.520 --> 01:31.679
How do we get it down? Ideas?

01:31.839 --> 01:34.280
I could get it! I could climb outside

01:34.440 --> 01:37.119

on that fun ship cruise?

a lot, Ollie.

03:02.880 --> 03:05.040
Something in his eye, maybe?

03:05.280 --> 03:07.920
Because you lost
my superball on the roof!

Oh! So you were rubbing it in.
