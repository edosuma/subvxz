00:01.990 --> 00:04.990
>> Announcer: Previously on "big
brother" ... the 6th sense

00:04.990 --> 00:07.990
power alliance has been running
the house, orchestrating the

00:07.990 --> 00:12.000
demise of some of their biggest
threats in the game.

00:12.000 --> 00:16.990
>> We have been able to work
today to take out da' and Jeff.

00:16.990 --> 00:19.700
>> Announcer: But awe stipulate
was more concerned with his

00:19.700 --> 00:19.990
feelings for Liz.

00:19.990 --> 00:24.990
>> If it comes down to it I
might sacrifice my life in this

00:24.990 --> 00:31.000
game to fulfill the emptiness
that has been in my heart.

00:31.000 --> 00:34.700
>> Announcer: Before nominations
Austin told Jackie she may be a

00:34.700 --> 00:34.990
pawn.

00:34.990 --> 00:39.990
>> I could see maybe using you
as a pawn.

00:39.990 --> 00:42.290
>> Announcer: But when Jackie
spilled the beans.

00:42.290 --> 00:44.290
>> I think he is setting me up.

00:44.290 --> 00:48.990
>> It caused his alliance to
lose some trust in the tattoo

00:48.990 --> 00:48.990
giant.

00:48.990 --> 00:50.990
>> You have to be very, very
careful about Austin.

00:50.990 --> 00:56.950
>> I vuls known Austin can be an
emotion player but he should

00:56.950 --> 00:59.990
have come to the group and made
sure it was ok before going

00:59.990 --> 00:59.990
rogue.

00:59.990 --> 01:01.990
>> It didn't sway them from
targeting Audrey.

01:01.990 --> 01:06.830
And she became the 6th census
latest casualty.

01:06.830 --> 01:10.990
>> With know nine votes to evict
plus one penalty vote, Audrey,

01:10.990 --> 01:14.990
you are evicted from the "big
brother" house.

01:14.990 --> 01:19.990
>> With the power up for grabs,
Jackie and Vanessa toss to the

01:19.990 --> 01:21.700
top of the charts.

01:21.700 --> 01:23.990
Congratulations to Vanessa and
Jackie.

01:23.990 --> 01:26.990
You two are the new heads of
head of household.

01:26.990 --> 01:29.830
>> Announcer: Tonight four new
houseguests will be nominated

01:29.830 --> 01:32.990
and they go to war in the patel
of the block.

01:32.990 --> 01:37.990
All this right now on "big
brother"!

01:37.990 --> 02:17.990
>> That will probably come out
maybe.

02:17.990 --> 02:20.990
>> What's so funny?

02:20.990 --> 02:22.990
>> Uhm ...

02:22.990 --> 02:24.990
>> Good job girl.

02:24.990 --> 02:25.990
>> I don't know.

02:25.990 --> 02:26.990
>> You did great.

02:26.990 --> 02:33.990
>> It was the lucky --
>> I'm hoh this week.

02:33.990 --> 02:33.990
Yes!

02:33.990 --> 02:34.990
I'm so excited.

02:34.990 --> 02:37.990
I have been a pawn in the game
and I want to prove I'm not a

02:37.990 --> 02:38.410
pawn.

02:38.410 --> 02:38.990
I'm a queen.

02:38.990 --> 02:41.990
>> I wish I didn't have to go
against you.

02:41.990 --> 02:42.120
>> Why.

02:42.120 --> 02:43.990
>> You're good.

02:43.990 --> 02:47.700
>> You're hoh and you get a
lot of blood on your hands and I

02:47.700 --> 02:48.990
want to avoid that.

02:48.990 --> 02:51.990
As soon as Jackie won the first
spot I knew I had to win the

02:51.990 --> 02:53.700
second one.

02:53.700 --> 02:57.830
I sent Jeff home and that was a
close Ally in the game and I

02:57.830 --> 03:07.830
know I'm one of her top two
targets.

03:07.830 --> 03:12.000
>> We have been letting the
girls just run over us.

03:12.000 --> 03:19.990
>> We're just little minions
underneath their heel.

03:19.990 --> 03:25.540
>> Maybe we should do -- if we
don't do all guys and girls they

03:25.540 --> 03:26.540
would be crushing us.

03:26.540 --> 03:30.990
>> I can bet you, just my gut
feeling, that a guy is going to

03:30.990 --> 03:31.990
go home this week.

03:31.990 --> 03:32.990
>> Do you think so?

03:32.990 --> 03:35.990
>> Yep.

03:35.990 --> 03:35.990
>> Deal.

03:35.990 --> 03:39.990
>> Going into this week the
twins need to survive one more

03:39.990 --> 03:41.990
eviction to both come into the
house.

03:41.990 --> 03:45.990
So my goal is to make sure
they're not only safe in my

03:45.990 --> 03:51.990
alliance but with everybody in
the house.

03:51.990 --> 03:54.990
>> I have a plan of action
though.

03:54.990 --> 03:56.990
>> Really?

03:56.990 --> 03:56.990
Tell.

03:56.990 --> 04:04.990
>> Well, wait until he leaves
and I will implement operation

04:04.990 --> 04:04.990
Jason.

04:04.990 --> 04:07.990
>> Jason has been on to the
twins since the beginning.

04:07.990 --> 04:11.700
If I give him a little bit of
information I'm hoping that he

04:11.700 --> 04:14.120
he trusts me and doesn't look at
them as such a big target.

04:14.120 --> 04:17.990
>> Hopefully he doesn't betray
my confidence.

04:17.990 --> 04:19.990
I'm not going to say too much
but I will say enough.

04:19.990 --> 04:22.990
>> That's terrific.

04:22.990 --> 04:25.120
Seriously terrific.

04:25.120 --> 04:36.990
>> We were kissing.

04:36.990 --> 04:38.990
>> He likes you.

04:38.990 --> 04:40.000
>> I know.

04:40.000 --> 04:43.990
>> You need to stop playing
games with people's hearts.

04:43.990 --> 04:44.990
You are a heart breaker.

04:44.990 --> 04:48.990
>> Me and Austin have a plan
that he is going to be like,

04:48.990 --> 04:51.990
when they come not house
together they're going to have

04:51.990 --> 04:56.950
each ear's back over mine so I'm
looking for someone else to be

04:56.950 --> 05:02.540
with and he can just feel Jason
out.

05:02.540 --> 05:09.990
>> I have an idea.

05:09.990 --> 05:11.990
>> I want to talk to you.

05:11.990 --> 05:13.990
>> About what?

05:13.990 --> 05:16.990
>> Just a couple of things.

05:16.990 --> 05:19.990
>> That's what my mother says
when I'm in trouble.

05:19.990 --> 05:23.990
>> No, I just want to tell you
like I'm running around here

05:23.990 --> 05:25.990
with Liz and stuff.

05:25.990 --> 05:29.990
Unfortunately that person is not
able to be here all the time.

05:29.990 --> 05:31.830
>> Right.

05:31.830 --> 05:33.950
>> Well, we all know what is
going on.

05:33.950 --> 05:36.990
>> All of us had speculated
about the possible twins but I

05:36.990 --> 05:38.990
had been right all along.

05:38.990 --> 05:40.990
Austin why are you telling me
this.

05:40.990 --> 05:44.990
How does you telling me this
help you?

05:44.990 --> 05:47.000
>> And I know and it's so
obvious.

05:47.000 --> 05:50.990
>> And I'm caught in the middle
of it but I wanted to open up to

05:50.990 --> 05:52.990
you a little bit about it
because I'm exploding inside

05:52.990 --> 05:53.410
about it.

05:53.410 --> 05:57.700
>> You and the other one have a
lot of chemistry.

05:57.700 --> 05:58.990
Do you know their real names?

05:58.990 --> 06:01.540
>> Julia.

06:01.540 --> 06:02.990
>> Julia?

06:02.990 --> 06:04.000
It has a name.

06:04.000 --> 06:07.120
It's not just Liz number two.

06:07.120 --> 06:08.990
Its name is Julia.

06:08.990 --> 06:14.990
>> I don't really see --
>> she is very different.

06:14.990 --> 06:17.290
>> So you see it too.

06:17.290 --> 06:18.990
>> Yes.

06:18.990 --> 06:19.990
The personality is different.

06:19.990 --> 06:22.000
>> I like the other girl and I
want to develop something with

06:22.000 --> 06:24.990
her going forward but it sucks
because like three days at a

06:24.990 --> 06:30.410
time like this --
>> they come in and it won't

06:30.410 --> 06:30.990
guarantee them both jury.

06:30.990 --> 06:32.990
>> Which I'm not mad about.

06:32.990 --> 06:34.990
I want to split them eventually.

06:34.990 --> 06:36.950
I mean I don't want to say that
but like --

06:36.950 --> 06:38.990
>> you could take Liz to the
jury.

06:38.990 --> 06:40.990
>> That would be -- I would be
fine with that.

06:40.990 --> 06:44.990
>> My goal is to work with both
of the twins for as long as

06:44.990 --> 06:48.990
possible but at the end day my
heart belongs to one of them and

06:48.990 --> 06:48.990
that's Liz.

06:48.990 --> 06:53.120
>> As long as they're together,
they're always taking them over

06:53.120 --> 06:54.990
me, which I --
>> which is obvious.

06:54.990 --> 06:55.990
>> Which doesn't help me.

06:55.990 --> 06:58.990
>> No.

06:58.990 --> 07:02.990
>> I'm a little awake right now.

07:02.990 --> 07:03.990
That's not good.

07:03.990 --> 07:06.990
>> That's why I'm not going to
my own bed yet.

07:06.990 --> 07:08.990
>> You're on top of me!

07:08.990 --> 07:11.990
>>
>> Austin and the Liz's were

07:57.990 --> 07:59.990
going to be a target of mine
regardless.

07:59.990 --> 08:03.990
It is just more ammo I can use
to have everybody else turn

08:03.990 --> 08:04.990
against them as well.

08:04.990 --> 08:05.990
>> Shelli?

08:05.990 --> 08:08.990
Shelli?

08:08.990 --> 08:14.830
>> What?

08:14.830 --> 08:27.990
>> One is Julia and the other
someone Liz.

08:27.990 --> 08:32.990
Austin is trying to build a
bridge.

08:32.990 --> 08:35.990
>> He was in the bathroom with
me --

08:35.990 --> 08:36.990
>> it's Julia.

08:36.990 --> 08:37.990
>> Shut up!

08:37.990 --> 08:39.410
Stop it right now.

08:39.410 --> 08:41.990
>> And I know Jason is telling
the truth because he speculated

08:41.990 --> 08:45.990
there were twins the entire time
and now suddenly he knows that

08:45.990 --> 08:47.990
one of them is named Julia.

08:47.990 --> 08:49.950
What the heck, Austin?

08:49.950 --> 08:53.990
We had only one more week before
the twins were going to come in

08:53.990 --> 08:54.990
and you're exposing them?

08:54.990 --> 08:58.990
That was our little secret, man.

08:58.990 --> 09:00.990
>> Why do we have to get one
out.

09:00.990 --> 09:06.950
>> He wants to save the one he
likes.

09:06.950 --> 09:09.990
>> Oh, my God!

09:09.990 --> 09:12.000
>> This is so juicy.

09:12.000 --> 09:16.990
>> That's why he was like why do
I --

09:16.990 --> 09:18.990
>> this is food, good.

09:18.990 --> 09:20.540
>> Ok.

09:20.540 --> 09:29.990
Listen, soaustin told Jason
there are two twins, and their

09:29.990 --> 09:30.990
names are Liz and Julia.

09:30.990 --> 09:33.990
>> And it gets better.

09:33.990 --> 09:38.990
He told Jason if people target
them he wants Liz to be saved so

09:38.990 --> 09:40.990
he and Liz can go to jury
together.

09:40.990 --> 09:42.990
>> That will be too much.

09:42.990 --> 09:43.990
I'm digesting.

09:43.990 --> 09:45.990
>> Austin what are you doing?

09:45.990 --> 09:48.990
The whole reason we're willing
to work with the twins is when

09:48.990 --> 09:50.990
we get the second twin in the
house that's a number on our

09:50.990 --> 09:51.990
side.

09:51.990 --> 09:54.990
When you tell someone if it's ok
if they target them that's

09:54.990 --> 09:55.990
selling out your alliance.

09:55.990 --> 09:57.990
I'm not ok with that.

09:57.990 --> 10:00.990
>> Exactly.

10:00.990 --> 10:03.990
And if he found this out how far
will it get him.

10:03.990 --> 10:16.290
>> Maybe as far as one.

10:16.290 --> 10:20.990
>> I went downstairs to get some
shorts and I heard, Shelli, get

10:20.990 --> 10:23.990
in here, it's Meg and Jason.

10:23.990 --> 10:28.410
Jason said we know the twin's
names, Austin told them.

10:28.410 --> 10:31.700
Ok?

10:31.700 --> 10:33.990
So Austin told Jason I really,
really like Liz.

10:33.990 --> 10:36.410
And the other one's name is
Julia.

10:36.410 --> 10:39.990
If everyone can keep Liz because
I want to be in jury with Liz

10:39.990 --> 10:41.990
and target only Julia.

10:41.990 --> 10:43.990
How dumb is he being?

10:43.990 --> 10:45.990
Why would he --
>> they're twins.

10:45.990 --> 10:47.410
They're connected for life.

10:47.410 --> 10:48.990
>> I know.

10:48.990 --> 10:49.990
They're roomies.

10:49.990 --> 10:52.990
They have the same DNA.

10:52.990 --> 10:56.990
While they're telling me this,
Vanessa walks in the back and we

10:56.990 --> 11:02.830
all three, me, Meg and Jason
fill Vanessa in on the same

11:02.830 --> 11:02.990
thing.

11:02.990 --> 11:05.120
>> Get your ass in here.

11:05.120 --> 11:06.990
>> We want to talk.

11:06.990 --> 11:12.990
>> This is why Austin needs to
not talk without talking to us.

11:12.990 --> 11:13.990
>> Dumb!

11:13.990 --> 11:13.990
Dumb!

11:13.990 --> 11:17.990
>> He is basically throwing
Julia under the bus for his own

11:17.990 --> 11:19.990
good so he could hook one Liz.

11:19.990 --> 11:24.120
>> If Jason ever told Liz that,
Liz and Julia would turn against

11:24.120 --> 11:24.830
us.

11:24.830 --> 11:27.540
>> That's what I feel like is
what should happen.

11:27.540 --> 11:31.120
We will have to drop that bock
and be like we're looking out

11:31.120 --> 11:34.990
for the two of you and we want
to let you know what Austin has

11:34.990 --> 11:34.990
done.

11:34.990 --> 11:35.990
>> Why did Austin do this.

11:35.990 --> 11:36.990
>> I don't know.

11:36.990 --> 11:41.990
>> There's a big fork in the
road for 6th sense, do we

11:41.990 --> 11:46.000
commit to Austin despite the
information we're getting or cut

11:46.000 --> 11:50.000
him loose and reconsider our
allegiances.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.990
Is it possible we're going to
blow up our alliance.

11:51.990 --> 11:54.990
>> I have to sleep open this
because there's so many

11:54.990 --> 11:56.990
important parts of this.

11:56.990 --> 11:59.990
>> For sure, for sure.

11:59.990 --> 12:03.120
>> So hofnsly, I'm telling you,
it's way different than the

12:03.120 --> 12:04.830
first time.

12:04.830 --> 12:07.700
The first time I was so
overwhelmed and it's super

12:07.700 --> 12:11.990
exciting to hear from Mel for
sure but the game is, you will

12:11.990 --> 12:14.990
see dwrik quickly and you will
understand -- it's awkward.

12:14.990 --> 12:17.990
>> This week I'm co-hoh with
Jackie.

12:17.990 --> 12:20.990
And I know she has her own
agenda I'm sure we can find

12:20.990 --> 12:22.990
common ground and move forward
working together.

12:22.990 --> 12:26.990
>> Between the two of us we
should give our words that we

12:26.990 --> 12:29.990
don't back door each other and I
will give my word on that.

12:29.990 --> 12:30.990
For sure.

12:30.990 --> 12:34.990
>> We have to think about who
we're both ok with going home.

12:34.990 --> 12:39.990
Let me hear where your head is
at what I will tell you what I'm

12:39.990 --> 12:40.290
think.

12:40.290 --> 12:44.990
>> Since she put me up, I was
thinking Liz.

12:44.990 --> 12:46.990
>> Jackie brings up putting Liz
on the block.

12:46.990 --> 12:48.990
I decide not to pro test it.

12:48.990 --> 12:52.990
It's too obvious I'm working
with Liz if I put up any kind of

12:52.990 --> 12:53.000
fight.

12:53.000 --> 13:02.990
The second one I'm questioning
is I might put -- Meg.

13:02.990 --> 13:06.990
She's a threat with Austin 250
because it's going to be a

13:06.990 --> 13:06.990
threesome.

13:06.990 --> 13:08.990
Are you close with them too?

13:08.990 --> 13:10.990
>> My trust is not 100% with
them.

13:10.990 --> 13:13.990
>> Are you ok with Liz or Austin
going home.

13:13.990 --> 13:15.290
>> It's a toss up.

13:15.290 --> 13:18.990
But if we get rid of Austin now
we have the twins come in and

13:18.990 --> 13:21.990
two easy weeks and the house can
go after them!

13:21.990 --> 13:22.000
Ok.

13:22.000 --> 13:24.990
So that's where we're at and on
the same page.

13:24.990 --> 13:29.990
>> To be honest I would like to
stay hoh.

13:29.990 --> 13:31.990
But I want someone to go home
I'm fine with.

13:31.990 --> 13:37.990
If we can work something out --
let me tell you, get ready.

13:37.990 --> 13:41.990
Ok.

13:52.990 --> 13:55.990
Who wants to see my hoh
room?

13:55.990 --> 14:00.990
[Cheering]
Your guys ready?

14:00.990 --> 14:01.990
Let's go!

14:01.990 --> 14:04.990
>> Oh, my God!

14:04.990 --> 14:08.990
In just thought this would
happen!

14:08.990 --> 14:17.990
I never thought this would
happen.

14:17.990 --> 14:18.990
Oh, my goodness.

14:18.990 --> 14:22.990
>> You look like very similar.

14:22.990 --> 14:26.990
>> Seeing Jackie's hoh room
makes me want to be extra nice

14:26.990 --> 14:35.410
so maybe she can forget that Liz
put her up last week.

14:35.410 --> 14:36.990
>> Oh, my God.

14:36.990 --> 14:39.990
>> It's me and my two sisters.

14:39.990 --> 14:41.950
>> Is that you and your sister.

14:41.950 --> 14:43.000
>> Me and my mom.

14:43.000 --> 14:44.990
>> You're gorgeous.

14:44.990 --> 14:47.540
>> Put that down.

14:47.540 --> 14:47.990
>> Wow.

14:47.990 --> 14:51.990
>> Looking at the picture of
Vanessa and her mom, I'm not

14:51.990 --> 14:56.990
going to lie, it's kind of like
love at first site.

14:56.990 --> 14:58.410
She's definitely a smoke bomb.

14:58.410 --> 15:01.990
What more could a country boy
ask for.

15:01.990 --> 15:01.990
Gorgeous.

15:01.990 --> 15:10.990
And as for mom, you're smokin'
hot!

15:10.990 --> 15:13.990
>> I didn't want to be hoh
again.

15:13.990 --> 15:14.990
>> I know.

15:14.990 --> 15:16.700
I wanted it.

15:16.700 --> 15:17.990
The reason I'm so angry.

15:17.990 --> 15:21.990
>> Awe stipulate has been my
closest friend and strategic

15:21.990 --> 15:23.990
Ally since the beginning of this
thing.

15:23.990 --> 15:27.990
The possibility of back dooring
him is a game changer.

15:27.990 --> 15:32.990
To be considering it I have to
be 100% sure he is the Judas I

15:32.990 --> 15:32.990
suspect he is.

15:32.990 --> 15:38.290
>> So a lot of people have a
feeling about the twins.

15:38.290 --> 15:43.990
>> I talked to gliefnltd he was
telling me look, if there are

15:43.990 --> 15:46.990
twins he doesn't want to target
them yet, according to him.

15:46.990 --> 15:48.990
I don't know if he's telling the
truth.

15:48.990 --> 15:52.120
He wants to basically keep one
because he likes Liz.

15:52.120 --> 15:54.990
He said he liked one and didn't
like the other.

15:54.990 --> 15:55.990
We had a good conversation.

15:55.990 --> 15:58.000
>> I know she lying to me about
two things.

15:58.000 --> 16:00.990
First of all he's not giving me
all of of the details he has

16:00.990 --> 16:03.990
given to Jason and making it
sound like he was vague when he

16:03.990 --> 16:04.990
wasn't.

16:04.990 --> 16:08.700
Secondly, he specifically sold
Julia out to Jason and making it

16:08.700 --> 16:13.410
sound like Jason was the one to
sell Julia out to him and he

16:13.410 --> 16:13.990
just went along with it.

16:13.990 --> 16:17.990
>> You're going to do damage to
yourself if you open your mouth

16:17.990 --> 16:19.410
and talk to anyone.

16:19.410 --> 16:25.990
Trust me, you just have to --
don't lie to me.

16:25.990 --> 16:26.950
That's all I'm saying.

16:26.950 --> 16:29.540
If I ask you a question, make
sure you don't lie to me.

16:29.540 --> 16:32.410
>> I'm not trying to lie to
Vanessa about what I talked to

16:32.410 --> 16:32.990
Jason about.

16:32.990 --> 16:36.990
I just don't want to reveal
everything yet until this week

16:36.990 --> 16:37.290
plays out.

16:37.290 --> 16:40.990
Because I don't want her to yell
at me and think I was stupid for

16:40.990 --> 16:44.830
doing it.

16:44.830 --> 16:46.950
>> Vanessa -- yeah.

16:46.950 --> 16:48.990
>> Do you want to talk?

16:48.990 --> 16:55.990
>> No, I was just wanting to
tell you -- tell you that I had

16:55.990 --> 16:57.990
to get this off my chest.

16:57.990 --> 16:58.990
Your mom is gorgeous.

16:58.990 --> 17:01.950
>> Oh, here we go.

17:01.950 --> 17:02.990
I love my mama.

17:02.990 --> 17:08.990
>> She fishes and she likes --
>> too bad she's married.

17:08.990 --> 17:08.990
Man!

17:08.990 --> 17:12.990
>> I just had to tell her that.

17:12.990 --> 17:17.990
>> He's hiding the fact that we
work together.

17:17.990 --> 17:19.990
We need to let her know that.

17:19.990 --> 17:25.950
10 you had better not be in here
too much longer or she had know

17:25.950 --> 17:25.990
we're working together.

17:25.990 --> 17:27.990
>> All right.

17:27.990 --> 17:33.990
>>
>> there it is.

17:33.990 --> 17:36.990
Austin just hide to me have any
started questioning Austin in

17:36.990 --> 17:41.990
week three when he throws the
pov to John.

17:41.990 --> 17:44.990
From that point it's pretty much
downhill as he is falling in a

17:44.990 --> 17:48.990
lot of with Liz and his judgment
is clouded and he's no wronger

17:48.990 --> 17:52.990
making good decisions and he's
thinking emotionally and now he

17:52.990 --> 17:53.990
is lying blatantly to my face.

17:53.990 --> 17:57.000
>> Why did Austin have to lie to
me?

17:57.000 --> 17:57.700
Why?

17:57.700 --> 18:02.990
Why?

18:02.990 --> 18:06.990
>> So I'm obviously freaking out
because she's going to put us

18:06.990 --> 18:06.990
up.

18:06.990 --> 18:08.950
>> There's nothing I can say.

18:08.950 --> 18:10.990
>> I know.

18:10.990 --> 18:14.990
She knows yiegz are twins but I
tell you you are not going out.

18:14.990 --> 18:18.990
Ok? I want to tell you
something.

18:18.990 --> 18:21.990
Shelli and Clay obviously know
about it.

18:21.990 --> 18:26.000
They want to tell you at the end
of the week.

18:26.000 --> 18:29.990
I'm telling you, he is not
thinking very clearly.

18:29.990 --> 18:34.290
Him, he wants to make sure he
gets to jury with Liz at all

18:34.290 --> 18:34.990
cost.

18:34.990 --> 18:35.120
Let me ask you this.

18:35.120 --> 18:37.990
Does your sister like him
actual?

18:37.990 --> 18:38.990
She actual does?

18:38.990 --> 18:39.540
>> I don't think so.

18:39.540 --> 18:40.990
>> You don't think.

18:40.990 --> 18:43.990
So are you the type of person if
I tell you something are you

18:43.990 --> 18:47.700
going to freak out and go get
mad at Austin or keep it

18:47.700 --> 18:47.990
together.

18:47.990 --> 18:48.830
>> No.

18:48.830 --> 18:49.990
I will keep it together.

18:49.990 --> 18:49.990
>> Do you swear.

18:49.990 --> 18:52.290
>> 100% swear.

18:52.290 --> 18:53.990
>> Ok.

18:53.990 --> 18:57.990
>> I get pulled in the bathroom
by Jason of all people.

18:57.990 --> 19:01.990
And Jason said Austin came to
him, at what time the twins are

19:01.990 --> 19:08.830
real and he told them your name,
jaila, and told him everything

19:08.830 --> 19:12.990
and how he has catching you guys
up and this is the kicker.

19:12.990 --> 19:13.990
He said I really like Liz.

19:13.990 --> 19:17.120
I don't care if you target
Julia.

19:17.120 --> 19:19.830
How do you do that?

19:19.830 --> 19:22.990
Like first of all are you stupid
if you actually like Liz, how do

19:22.990 --> 19:24.290
you think she's going to feel?

19:24.290 --> 19:27.000
>> My blood is boiling!

19:27.000 --> 19:27.990
Guess what?

19:27.990 --> 19:31.990
You mess with one sister, you
mess with both of us and she

19:31.990 --> 19:36.000
doesn't even like you so --
joke's on you.

19:36.000 --> 19:39.990
>> That makes me sick to my
stomach and he didn't think

19:39.990 --> 19:43.990
Jason would tell anyone.

19:43.990 --> 19:45.990
>> That's it.

19:45.990 --> 19:49.990
Oh, my God.

19:49.990 --> 19:52.990
>> Oh, I loathe him.

19:52.990 --> 19:55.120
>> So you're not going to tell
your sister.

19:55.120 --> 19:57.990
>> No.

19:57.990 --> 19:58.990
She will come in mad.

19:58.990 --> 20:01.990
>> I swear to God I will not
tell her that.

20:01.990 --> 20:02.990
Ok.

20:10.990 --> 20:10.990
>> Knock-knock.

20:10.990 --> 20:11.990
>> Hey there, who is this?

20:11.990 --> 20:12.990
>> Your favorite.

20:12.990 --> 20:13.990
>> Is anyone else in here?

20:13.990 --> 20:14.990
>> No.

20:14.990 --> 20:17.990
>> Just your favorites.

20:17.990 --> 20:17.990
Ok.

20:17.990 --> 20:22.990
>> I asked Austin pointblank.

20:22.990 --> 20:24.990
I go you know everyone knows
about the twins.

20:24.990 --> 20:28.990
And he goes yeah, like Jason
asked me but what did you tell

20:28.990 --> 20:31.830
him he completely lied to my
face 100%.

20:31.830 --> 20:34.410
If you lie to me and get caught,
it's over.

20:34.410 --> 20:35.290
I don't trust him.

20:35.290 --> 20:36.990
He is not working with me.

20:36.990 --> 20:37.290
That's it.

20:37.290 --> 20:45.990
>> There's always tbeengs 6th
sense Liz and then there's

20:45.990 --> 20:45.990
Chloe.

20:45.990 --> 20:48.990
I knew there was a time I was
going to have to pick one side

20:48.990 --> 20:51.990
off the other.

20:51.990 --> 20:56.950
>> Liz has shown a crack in the
foundation with Austin lack of

20:56.950 --> 20:58.990
highlight and I'm switching over
to the loyalty side of things at

20:58.990 --> 20:59.000
Austin's expense.

20:59.000 --> 21:04.290
>> He has so much information
about us, especially me because

21:04.290 --> 21:05.990
I was hoh with him.

21:05.990 --> 21:08.120
>> You have more on him than he
does on you.

21:08.120 --> 21:10.120
>> Hey, Jackie.

21:10.120 --> 21:12.990
>> She wants to stay in power,
I'm fine to not.

21:12.990 --> 21:17.990
>> If you want somebody to go
home who would you pick?

21:17.990 --> 21:23.990
>> Either Austin --
>> host likely think of the Liz.

21:23.990 --> 21:24.990
>> That will be it.

21:24.990 --> 21:26.990
Put me up and done.

21:26.990 --> 21:29.290
>> Who with you put up.

21:29.290 --> 21:32.990
>> Do we want to find someone,
chew through it?

21:32.990 --> 21:36.990
It needs to be someone we -- we
already did Meg though.

21:36.990 --> 21:37.990
We couldn't do it to her.

21:37.990 --> 21:37.990
I can't.

21:37.990 --> 21:41.990
>> You either win hoh or
sometimes you have to go up as a

21:41.990 --> 21:41.990
pawn.

21:41.990 --> 21:46.990
The other side of things -- I
know it's tricky.

21:46.990 --> 21:51.990
We need people who are good
competitors working for a for

21:51.990 --> 21:52.990
sure win.

21:52.990 --> 21:55.990
It would be like the risk that
could get you super far because

21:55.990 --> 22:00.830
no one is ever going to expect
that we're working together.

22:00.830 --> 22:03.990
And you have to act pissed
I-it's good for you because you

22:03.990 --> 22:09.990
will never get a spot --
>> this is a risky move however

22:09.990 --> 22:12.990
I know Becky is a strong
competitor.

22:12.990 --> 22:14.990
Hopefully we can pull out a win
and send Austin packing.

22:14.990 --> 22:18.290
>> I would go for Becky.

22:18.290 --> 22:21.990
>> This is great.

22:21.990 --> 22:25.990
We just need Becky to agree to
go up beside him and both of

22:25.990 --> 22:35.990
them to win battle of the block.

22:35.990 --> 22:38.990
>> We're going to all work
together.

22:38.990 --> 22:39.990
Everyone is on board.

22:39.990 --> 22:40.990
No one is going home.

22:40.990 --> 22:42.990
>> Ok.

22:42.990 --> 22:44.990
>> Would you want to go up?

22:44.990 --> 22:45.990
>> No.

22:45.990 --> 22:50.540
>> Well if you went up with
Clay, would you?

22:50.540 --> 22:53.990
Because Clay is going to go up
on the winning side.

22:53.990 --> 22:55.540
>> Well yeah.

22:55.540 --> 22:57.700
>> Because he said he would like
to go with you.

22:57.700 --> 23:01.990
>> If the other side is down to
know that they're going to be --

23:01.990 --> 23:06.700
>> nobody is going to may that
doesn't have to.

23:06.700 --> 23:09.990
>> Yeah.

23:09.990 --> 23:11.990
>> Putting up Liz so that person
has to.

23:11.990 --> 23:12.990
>> Then I'm in.

23:12.990 --> 23:13.990
>> She's do!

23:13.990 --> 23:14.990
Are we on?

23:14.990 --> 23:15.410
>> Yes.

23:15.410 --> 23:15.990
>> For real?

23:15.990 --> 23:19.990
>> Ok.

23:19.990 --> 23:19.990
Whew.

23:19.990 --> 23:23.990
>> With Clay and Becky ready to
go up on my side to win battle

23:23.990 --> 23:26.410
of the block, it's time to put
her up next to Liz and throw the

23:26.410 --> 23:28.290
competition.

23:33.990 --> 23:34.990
>> Ok.

23:34.990 --> 23:36.990
So here is the deal.

23:36.990 --> 23:43.000
I know what people think that
I'm working with Austin and Liz.

23:43.000 --> 23:46.000
Quite frankly I was loyal to
them until Austin betrayed me.

23:46.000 --> 23:48.990
And everyone knows I do not like
liars.

23:48.990 --> 23:52.990
Jackie sits me down and we talk
about who the targets are a and

23:52.990 --> 23:58.990
we realize it's very likely that
there are twins.

23:58.990 --> 24:01.990
Obviously they're number one
Ally is Austin.

24:01.990 --> 24:04.990
So it would be best to have
Austin go home first and then

24:04.990 --> 24:08.700
the twins twins and it leaves a
big target in the house.

24:08.700 --> 24:10.990
How do we maximize this
occurring.

24:10.990 --> 24:13.990
Austin a much better back door
target.

24:13.990 --> 24:17.950
>> Austin has no idea who is
going down and he can't know

24:17.950 --> 24:18.990
until the last second obviously.

24:18.990 --> 24:24.990
She has reason to put the twins
up.

24:24.990 --> 24:26.990
She has never been on the block.

24:26.990 --> 24:33.990
We got Clay to volunteer to go
on my side alongside Becky.

24:33.990 --> 24:36.990
They will be strong competitors.

24:36.990 --> 24:39.700
So we need someone on your side
to spoil it with Liz.

24:39.700 --> 24:40.990
>> That stresses me.

24:40.990 --> 24:43.990
I said I would never throw
anything there this game.

24:43.990 --> 24:47.990
But I get the concept.

24:47.990 --> 24:48.990
It's foolproof.

24:48.990 --> 24:52.990
>> James did you put up Jackie?

24:52.990 --> 24:55.540
That would be a reason that it
would look like a real reason.

24:55.540 --> 24:57.990
>> Sorry, James but a pawn for a
pawn.

24:57.990 --> 25:02.990
>> But it's coming from me and I
can now show my loyalty back to

25:02.990 --> 25:09.990
you?

25:09.990 --> 25:12.990
If you want to put me up, you
can.

25:12.990 --> 25:15.990
>> They said they would be
willing to make a deal.

25:15.990 --> 25:18.990
With eight of us, we will get
those those three out and that's

25:18.990 --> 25:19.990
the plan.

25:19.990 --> 25:22.830
>> I'm absolutely in for all of
that.

25:22.830 --> 25:26.990
>> Austin can't know about the
throwing.

25:26.990 --> 25:27.990
Ok?

25:27.990 --> 25:32.000
>> I just want to say -- I'm
going to say to him, like you

25:32.000 --> 25:35.990
have my word, 100% of the plan
and you have to be on board,

25:35.990 --> 25:38.990
like we're finally --
>> the best part of the plan is

25:38.990 --> 25:42.990
that Jackie has agreed to remain
in power and allow me to be

25:42.990 --> 25:45.990
dethrone sod she's going to get
all of the blood on her hands

25:45.990 --> 25:46.990
for back dooring Austin, not me.

25:46.990 --> 25:52.700
>> We have have to think of a
name.

25:52.700 --> 25:53.000
>> Dark moon?

25:53.000 --> 25:54.990
That's so good.

26:01.990 --> 26:02.990
Can't get enough of Big Brother?

26:18.990 --> 26:18.990
>> Zip-up?

26:18.990 --> 26:20.990
>> How are you?

26:20.990 --> 26:20.990
>> Good.

26:20.990 --> 26:22.990
>> She's not putting you up.

26:22.990 --> 26:25.990
>> 100%.

26:25.990 --> 26:31.120
She is putting Liz up.

26:31.120 --> 26:32.990
>> I figured.

26:32.990 --> 26:33.990
>> There's no way around it.

26:33.990 --> 26:35.830
There's not anything to do.

26:35.830 --> 26:35.990
>> Ok.

26:35.990 --> 26:37.990
And her --
>> that's not bad.

26:37.990 --> 26:41.990
>> By plan to back door Austin
is in motion.

26:41.990 --> 26:45.700
There's one more piece to put in
motion, feeding Austin a story

26:45.700 --> 26:48.990
about why some of our alliance
members are going on the block.

26:48.990 --> 26:52.990
I have to get Shelli or Clay to
go up.

26:52.990 --> 26:55.990
I have to put one of them up
because they haven't been on the

26:55.990 --> 26:56.990
block yet.

26:56.990 --> 26:59.990
More than likely Clay because he
has to go up once and it's

26:59.990 --> 27:04.990
better he does it under my reign
where I can control who is next

27:04.990 --> 27:04.990
in.

27:04.990 --> 27:06.950
So I'm thinking Becky.

27:06.950 --> 27:08.990
I could put Becky up.

27:08.990 --> 27:11.830
Becky is my target and I would
put up Clay or whatever.

27:11.830 --> 27:12.990
>> They're going to win.

27:12.990 --> 27:13.990
>> Who.

27:13.990 --> 27:15.990
>> Becky and Clay.

27:15.990 --> 27:16.990
I would think they would win.

27:16.990 --> 27:19.990
>> I can't break it with her.

27:19.990 --> 27:24.000
If I break it --
>> we're not able to break

27:24.000 --> 27:24.990
anything.

27:24.990 --> 27:27.990
>> Right.

27:27.990 --> 27:31.990
Why won't she put Steve up.

27:31.990 --> 27:35.830
>> Who is she going to put up if
Liz wins?

27:35.830 --> 27:37.120
>> Right.

27:37.120 --> 27:42.410
>> The hero in me wants to be
like I will go up and throw it

27:42.410 --> 27:43.410
on the other side for her.

27:43.410 --> 27:44.990
>> But that's stupid.

27:44.990 --> 27:45.990
>> I know.

27:45.990 --> 27:47.990
I can't do that.

28:15.290 --> 28:18.120
This is the nomination
ceremony.

28:18.120 --> 28:22.410
It's our responsibility as the
heads of household to each

28:22.410 --> 28:25.290
nominate two houseguests for
eviction.

28:25.290 --> 28:36.990
The first houseguest I have
nominated is ...

28:36.990 --> 28:51.990
The next houseguest I have
nominated is ... I have

28:51.990 --> 28:54.990
nominated you, James, and you
Liz because you both have each

28:54.990 --> 28:56.990
put me on the block.

28:56.990 --> 29:01.990
So just returning the favor.

29:01.990 --> 29:16.540
>> The first houseguest I have
nominated is ... the second

29:16.540 --> 29:29.990
houseguest I have nominated is
...

29:29.990 --> 29:32.990
>> I have nominated you Clay and
you Becky.

29:32.990 --> 29:34.990
I tried to be as fair as
possible.

29:34.990 --> 29:38.700
Clay you have yet to win hoh
or be put on the block so it's

29:38.700 --> 29:39.990
strictly a game decision.

29:39.990 --> 29:42.990
Becky I know you have the
maturity to respect this for the

29:42.990 --> 29:44.990
game move that it is.

29:44.990 --> 29:47.990
I wish you both the best luck in
the Bob.

29:47.990 --> 29:55.000
This nomination ceremony is
adjourned.

29:55.000 --> 29:59.410
>> The nomination ceremony is
over and I'm really nervous

29:59.410 --> 30:00.990
about Liz being on the block.

30:00.990 --> 30:02.990
I feel totally powerless right
now.

30:02.990 --> 30:06.990
All I can do is trust in
Vanessa's plan --

30:06.990 --> 30:11.990
>> it really sucks being on the
block, especially since Liz and

30:11.990 --> 30:15.990
I have one more eviction to make
it through before we can both

30:15.990 --> 30:24.990
play in the house together so --
>> hey buddy, you're on the

30:24.990 --> 30:24.990
block.

30:24.990 --> 30:28.990
>> Congratulations.

30:28.990 --> 30:29.990
>> I'm happy for you.

30:29.990 --> 30:30.990
It's about time.

30:30.990 --> 30:31.990
>> Whoa!

30:31.990 --> 30:32.990
I am not on the block.

30:32.990 --> 30:34.000
This is crazy!

30:34.000 --> 30:38.120
Like I have been doing all right
being nominated every week but a

30:38.120 --> 30:41.410
week where I'm not going to be
nominated?

30:41.410 --> 30:42.990
What do I do with myself?

30:42.990 --> 30:46.990
Do I just sit here like -- this
is awesome!

30:46.990 --> 30:53.990
>> I get to watch the
competition?

30:53.990 --> 30:58.990
>> I'm just telling you, you
aren't the target.

30:58.990 --> 31:02.990
So you know the situation --
>> I don't know if I can trust

31:02.990 --> 31:06.990
Jackie but I really trust
Vanessa and if she's telling me

31:06.990 --> 31:11.990
I'm not the target, I believe
her.

31:11.990 --> 31:12.990
>> All right.

31:12.990 --> 31:14.990
>> I like Julia.

31:14.990 --> 31:19.990
I actually really like her and I
want her to feel ok about being

31:19.990 --> 31:22.990
on the block and not the target
but it's game play.

31:22.990 --> 31:26.410
Once Austin is out of here I
want to make sure I'm the person

31:26.410 --> 31:31.700
she and her sister trust the
most.

31:31.700 --> 31:38.990
>>
>> Liz, please go to the diary

31:38.990 --> 31:39.120
room.

31:39.120 --> 31:43.290
>> My plan is to not tell Liz
about the Austin situation.

31:43.290 --> 31:47.990
If she knows the truth ask wants
to get me out of the house her

31:47.990 --> 31:52.120
head is not going to be clear
when she plays battle of the

31:52.120 --> 31:57.990
block and I need her to win this
for us.

31:57.990 --> 31:59.990
>> Are you yawning?

31:59.990 --> 32:03.120
>> No, I swear to God, she put
up me and James.

32:03.120 --> 32:04.990
>> Who all is on the block.

32:04.990 --> 32:06.700
>> Clay and Becky.

32:06.700 --> 32:09.700
>> We're playing against team
America, ok?

32:09.700 --> 32:09.990
Like seriously.

32:09.990 --> 32:11.990
>> I know, sob.

32:11.990 --> 32:16.990
>> So whatever, so Jackie wins
first and then Vanessa.

32:16.990 --> 32:20.410
We always -- let me tell you
Vanessa is the only one that has

32:20.410 --> 32:20.990
our back.

32:20.990 --> 32:22.990
>> I think Austin does too.

32:22.990 --> 32:23.990
>> Why?

32:23.990 --> 32:24.990
>> I don't know.

32:24.990 --> 32:27.990
I just do not get a good vibe
from Austin.

32:27.990 --> 32:28.990
Whatever, Liz.

32:28.990 --> 32:31.990
This is the best thing that
you're playing in this weekend.

32:31.990 --> 32:33.990
Because Austin is going to do
anything for you.

32:33.990 --> 32:34.990
I'm not kidding.

32:34.990 --> 32:37.830
He really likes you.

32:37.830 --> 32:40.990
Like scary creep.

32:40.990 --> 32:44.990
>> Seriously, shut up.

32:44.990 --> 32:48.700
>> Ok.

32:48.700 --> 32:49.830
>> Why?

32:49.830 --> 32:50.990
You're such a babe.

32:54.990 --> 32:56.540
>> (Knocking).

32:56.540 --> 32:56.990
>> Come in.

32:56.990 --> 32:59.990
>> Were y'all talking?

32:59.990 --> 33:02.000
>> About nothing that you
wouldn't know about.

33:02.000 --> 33:03.290
>> Everything ok.

33:03.290 --> 33:08.990
>> I just wanted to check n
seeing his face on that wall

33:08.990 --> 33:09.990
made me want to vomit.

33:09.990 --> 33:15.990
>> The best gift is for him to
be up there though.

33:15.990 --> 33:21.990
This is the safest way for him
to be on the block.

33:21.990 --> 33:23.990
>> That's the best case
scenario.

33:23.990 --> 33:28.410
>> I did everything I can to
make sure that Clay and Becky

33:28.410 --> 33:29.990
get off the block.

33:29.990 --> 33:33.990
But if by some miracle Liz is
able to pull off a win all by

33:33.990 --> 33:37.990
herself I'm going to be taking
off a swan dive off the top of a

33:37.990 --> 33:41.990
building into a pool of blood.

33:47.990 --> 33:51.990
>> Hey everyone it's time for
the brat El of the block

33:51.990 --> 33:52.990
competition.

33:52.990 --> 33:59.990
Meet me out back!

33:59.990 --> 34:00.830
Oh, my God.

34:00.830 --> 34:07.540
>> What the hell?

34:07.540 --> 34:13.990
>> All right.

34:13.990 --> 34:18.120
>> Look over here.

34:18.120 --> 34:22.410
>> So I walk into the back yard
and it's the bb newsroom.

34:22.410 --> 34:25.990
>> I he see a giant blank wall
and I think that's probably what

34:25.990 --> 34:27.540
it looks like in Clay's head.

34:27.540 --> 34:30.410
>> Welcome to the "Big Brother"
newsroom.

34:30.410 --> 34:35.990
Your job is to stay on top of
the latest news and gossip about

34:35.990 --> 34:37.950
former bb houseguests.

34:37.950 --> 34:42.990
Jacky's nominees will battle the
nexus nominees to save

34:42.990 --> 34:43.990
themselves from the chopping
block.

34:43.990 --> 34:47.990
The winning pair not only earns
safety but will dethrone the

34:47.990 --> 34:48.990
hoh that nominated them.

34:48.990 --> 34:50.990
Here is how it workers.

34:50.990 --> 34:55.990
Today's headline is about three
bb houseguests from last summer

34:55.990 --> 34:59.990
who were seen eating at an
outback steakhouse.

34:59.990 --> 35:03.990
It's up to you to figure out
which ones.

35:03.990 --> 35:06.990
On go you will start throwing
paint at anything and everything

35:06.990 --> 35:08.990
in the newsroom.

35:08.990 --> 35:14.990
As you toss point, invisible
letters will reveal themselves.

35:14.990 --> 35:16.990
Letters could be on your own
clothing.

35:16.990 --> 35:21.990
At any point during your letter
serve you may go to your station

35:21.990 --> 35:26.990
and use the tiles to unscramble
the name of three bb houseguests

35:26.990 --> 35:27.990
from last season.

35:27.990 --> 35:31.990
When you think you have the
headline correct, hit your

35:31.990 --> 35:32.290
button.

35:32.290 --> 35:36.990
The first time to correctly
compete their headline will win

35:36.990 --> 35:37.990
the battle of the block.

35:37.990 --> 35:41.990
In this competition there's even
more at stake because the

35:41.990 --> 35:45.540
winning team and the remaining
hoh will also receive a very

35:45.540 --> 35:47.990
special reward.

35:47.990 --> 35:55.830
Who is ready to play?

35:55.830 --> 35:57.950
Yeah!

35:57.950 --> 36:01.990
>> If Julie and I survive this
week we both get to come into

36:01.990 --> 36:06.990
the house so the battle of the
block is absolutely crucial to

36:06.990 --> 36:07.120
guarantee our safety.

36:07.120 --> 36:11.990
>> My mission is to throw the
competition so we can set up a

36:11.990 --> 36:13.990
back door plan to get Austin out
of here.

36:13.990 --> 36:17.990
I can't make it too obvious so I
have to make it look like I'm

36:17.990 --> 36:20.990
trying but I'm not trying.

36:20.990 --> 36:22.990
>> This has too work out.

36:22.990 --> 36:27.990
My goal is to get dethroned and
let Jackie do the dirty work

36:27.990 --> 36:28.990
from here on out.

36:28.990 --> 36:34.950
>> Ready, set, go!

36:35.990 --> 36:42.990
>> The object of the game is
solve three games of "big

36:42.990 --> 36:46.990
brother" season 16 houseguests
that are hidden all over the

36:46.990 --> 36:46.990
newsroom.

36:46.990 --> 36:50.990
We have to throw paint
everywhere, the wall, the disk,

36:50.990 --> 36:54.990
the first time to spell all
three correctly and hit their

36:54.990 --> 36:58.990
buzzer will win battle of the
block for a week.

36:58.990 --> 36:59.990
>> Oh, my God!

36:59.990 --> 37:05.990
>> So my strategy is too cover
this entire newsroom with paint.

37:05.990 --> 37:08.990
We have to use all of the
letters that we uncover to

37:08.990 --> 37:14.990
figure out the three names and
there's only one answer to this

37:14.990 --> 37:15.700
puzzle.

37:15.700 --> 37:18.990
>> Oh, my God, I feel so sick.

37:18.990 --> 37:19.990
>> Do you see anything.

37:19.990 --> 37:22.990
>> The plan is to throw the
competition.

37:22.990 --> 37:27.990
So it's time to sit back, relax,
throw paint on the walls and do

37:27.990 --> 37:31.990
things mom and dodd wouldn't let
me do when I was a kid.

37:31.990 --> 37:37.990
I must look nerdier than a
squirrel turd right now.

37:37.990 --> 37:43.540
>> So my biggest stream is for
me to throw paint all over the

37:43.540 --> 37:45.990
newsroom and shout the letters
that appear while she's there

37:45.990 --> 37:50.000
separating the letters and
trying to solve this puzzle.

37:50.000 --> 37:55.990
>> I notice a, y and g and I
thought Hayden has to be one of

37:55.990 --> 37:58.830
the names and I begin to spell
it.

37:58.830 --> 37:59.990
>> We have r.

37:59.990 --> 38:04.990
>> We're moving fast trying to
get the names on the wall and

38:04.990 --> 38:08.830
start making the guesses for the
names.

38:08.830 --> 38:10.990
>> Go, go, go!

38:10.990 --> 38:11.990
Come on.

38:11.990 --> 38:15.990
>>
[Buzzer]

38:15.990 --> 38:19.000
>> Come on, Clay.

38:19.000 --> 38:24.990
>> Ok.

38:24.990 --> 38:29.830
>> We start get -- get some
numbers, some letters.

38:29.830 --> 38:30.990
>> I know.

38:30.990 --> 38:30.990
I know.

38:30.990 --> 38:35.990
>> As much as I love James I
quickly realize that he is not

38:35.990 --> 38:40.990
the sharpest crayon in n. That
crayola box.

38:40.990 --> 38:44.990
I have to be the brains in this
operation.

38:44.990 --> 38:46.990
>> Just look at numbers or
letters whatever it is.

38:46.990 --> 38:50.990
>> There isn't any numbers in
any of the names.

38:50.990 --> 38:52.990
Like I'm not getting any help
here.

38:52.990 --> 38:54.990
>> Sorry.

38:54.990 --> 39:05.990
>> Darn it, yes, yes.

39:05.990 --> 39:07.990
>>
[Buzzer]

39:07.990 --> 39:09.290
>> Obviously this is not
working.

39:09.290 --> 39:14.990
We need more paint on there to
up cover more letters.

39:14.990 --> 39:15.990
>> Oh, my God.

39:15.990 --> 39:21.990
Now we're talking!

39:21.990 --> 39:23.830
>> Hayden and Cody both have
d's.

39:23.830 --> 39:28.990
So --
[Buzzer]

39:28.990 --> 39:32.700
>> More paint, y'all.

39:32.700 --> 39:35.990
>> C, o, l.

39:35.990 --> 39:41.990
>> I don't know it's -- is
interest a y?

39:41.990 --> 39:46.000
>> I'm supposed to betreauxing
this competition but Liz is one

39:46.000 --> 39:47.990
smart cookie.

39:47.990 --> 39:48.990
Going a hundred Miles per hour.

39:48.990 --> 39:51.700
She won't stop.

39:51.700 --> 39:55.990
If she doesn't slow down there's
pretty much no way I can throw

39:55.990 --> 39:56.120
this comp.

39:56.120 --> 39:59.290
>> Thank you thank you, James.

39:59.290 --> 40:04.990
>> Victoria.

40:04.990 --> 40:15.990
>> R, I --
>> Hayden, maybe -- define was

40:15.990 --> 40:15.990
Hayden?

40:15.990 --> 40:19.540
>> We have Hayden and Victoria
on the board and I can't figure

40:19.540 --> 40:21.000
out who the last person is.

40:21.000 --> 40:23.990
We go through the letters and I
realize it has to be Christine.

40:23.990 --> 40:36.990
>> Christine.

40:36.990 --> 40:42.990
>> Come on, come on.

40:42.990 --> 40:44.830
>> Ahh.

40:44.830 --> 40:46.990
>> Congratulations James Liz.

40:46.990 --> 40:51.410
>> You have won the battle of
the block and are now safe this

40:51.410 --> 41:02.990
week!

41:02.990 --> 41:08.990
>> Yes, yes!

41:08.990 --> 41:11.990
>> I cannot believe I just won
battle of the block.

41:11.990 --> 41:13.990
It is the best feeling ever!

41:13.990 --> 41:14.290
I'm safe.

41:14.290 --> 41:17.990
That means that we have made it
through the fifth eviction and

41:17.990 --> 41:20.990
juju is about to come in the
building.

41:20.990 --> 41:23.120
See you soon, Julia!

41:23.120 --> 41:23.990
I can't wait.

41:23.990 --> 41:25.990
>> You did it on your own.

41:25.990 --> 41:25.990
>> Oh, my God.

41:25.990 --> 41:28.990
>> We had this almost perfect
plan.

41:28.990 --> 41:32.540
All of the pieces were in place
go everything was set up and

41:32.540 --> 41:35.990
then what happened -- James and
Liz!

41:35.990 --> 41:41.950
You two along with Vanessa will
enjoy a private outback

41:41.950 --> 41:41.990
steakhouse dinner!

41:41.990 --> 41:48.990
I hope you're hungry because you
will enjoy delicious ribeyes,

41:48.990 --> 41:53.120
steakhouse Mac and cheese and
margaritas and much more!

41:53.120 --> 41:54.990
And a bloomin' onion.

41:54.990 --> 41:57.990
>> Even though I didn't want to
win battle of the block I think

41:57.990 --> 42:01.990
it's awesome we get a meal from
outback steakhouse.

42:01.990 --> 42:02.990
This country boy has to eat.

42:02.990 --> 42:07.990
>> Unfortunately Jackie you are
no longer a head of household.

42:07.990 --> 42:11.990
But you get to enjoy this paint!

42:11.990 --> 42:12.000
Ahh!

42:12.000 --> 42:18.990
>> So I got dethroned as hoh
and that wasn't the plan.

42:18.990 --> 42:24.950
Becky dropped the ball and Liz
ended up doing the comp by

42:24.950 --> 42:24.990
herself.

42:24.990 --> 42:25.950
Worst-case scenario here.

42:25.950 --> 42:28.000
>> They had it right.

42:28.000 --> 42:34.990
>> Clay remains up on the block
on Thursday night, panic city!

42:34.990 --> 42:35.700
Panic city!

42:35.700 --> 42:40.990
>> This was supposed to be a
full proof plan and it ended up

42:40.990 --> 42:42.990
blowing up in our faces.

42:42.990 --> 42:45.990
Hopefully we can still back door
Austin.

42:45.990 --> 42:46.990
Unfortunately now I'm on the
block.

42:46.990 --> 42:50.410
Why did I volunteer to go on the
block again?

42:50.410 --> 42:53.700
>> Who will win the power of
veto?

42:53.700 --> 42:58.540
And will it be used to save
Becky or Clay from eviction?

42:58.540 --> 43:08.990
