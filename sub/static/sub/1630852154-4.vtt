for Priestly Demolition.

00:16.633 --> 00:18.266
Before the machines move in
to wreck,

00:18.400 --> 00:20.667
my team's job is to get in
the building

00:20.800 --> 00:22.533

Oh yeah.

wouldn't dream of getting into

- And Ted never disappoints.

01:58.400 --> 02:00.767

to steer massive log booms.

09:00.600 --> 09:02.467
Russel Brothers
also built boats

09:02.600 --> 09:04.467
for the allied landing
in Europe on D-Day

09:04.600 --> 09:06.333
and they built two
Maids of the Mist

09:06.467 --> 09:08.934
that are still operating
in Niagara Falls.

09:09.066 --> 09:10.734
- How're we goinna get this
thing outta here?

09:10.867 --> 09:13.033
- It's a lot lighter in the
water and easy to maneuver,

09:13.166 --> 09:15.266
so maybe we can just get it
over to that ramp.

09:15.400 --> 09:17.367
- I didn't think we would end
up taking this boat back,

09:17.500 --> 09:18.867
but Ted's in love.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.333
- Hey, Lukas. Yeah, can you
back down? We're almost ready

09:21.467 --> 09:23.233
to pull this sucker over?
All right. Okay, bud.

09:23.367 --> 09:25.000
Brandon: We come up with
this plan.

09:25.133 --> 09:26.900
Ted's gonna pull the front
of the boat,

09:27.033 --> 09:29.367
I'm gonna put the oar in the
water and push off the rocks.

09:29.500 --> 09:31.533
- Yeah, that works,
that's perfect.

09:31.667 --> 09:33.567
My feet are soaked!

09:35.066 --> 09:36.467
All right, man, that's not bad.

to build the access road,

09:42.700 --> 09:44.867
he wonders what's keeping
Ted and Brandon.

09:45.000 --> 09:46.600
- So Ted and Brandon have been
gone for two hours.

09:46.734 --> 09:48.333
We don't have a lot of time.

09:48.467 --> 09:50.867
They need to come back here,
so we can finish this job.

09:51.000 --> 09:52.700
- All right, let's do it.

09:52.834 --> 09:55.100
(Truck beeps)

09:58.133 --> 10:00.667
- Should be a flat bottom.

10:07.166 --> 10:09.867
I've pulled a lot of boats
out of the water before,

10:10.000 --> 10:13.567
no problem,
but never a six-ton tugboat.

10:14.867 --> 10:16.533
- Of course, it'd be easier
if it went on straight.

10:16.667 --> 10:19.333
It's the angle it doesn't like
to pull on.

10:19.467 --> 10:20.867

- Oh yeah, it's way off
over here.

10:30.467 --> 10:32.233
- There's no way we could
straighten that out.

10:32.367 --> 10:35.700
- Not now, six tons,
that it's outta the water,

10:35.834 --> 10:37.467
we're not moving it now.
- No.

10:37.600 --> 10:39.333

Holy (bleep).

10:44.500 --> 10:46.033
- Boy, that tore that
like nothing.

onto this trailer,

18:10.667 --> 18:12.533

18:12.667 --> 18:15.233

there. HB.

18:15.367 --> 18:17.100
- I never seen one.

18:17.233 --> 18:20.667
I've heard about exchange of
jewelry for pelts. That's cool.

18:20.800 --> 18:22.667
- Few minutes later,
that tin would've been

18:22.800 --> 18:24.166
smashed on the ground,

18:24.300 --> 18:26.100
'cause that thing was
coming down.

18:26.233 --> 18:27.767
Keep looking here.

18:27.900 --> 18:29.333
I wanna make sure there's
nothing else.

18:29.467 --> 18:32.667
- Agh! We gotta get this
building down.

18:32.800 --> 18:34.300
- Whoops! I broke the glass.

18:34.433 --> 18:36.633

- What?

18:36.767 --> 18:38.533

18:43.467 --> 18:45.834

trailer with the day's haul.

very cool?

19:08.166 --> 19:09.533

- What'd you find?

19:12.200 --> 19:14.266
Oh, look at that!

19:14.400 --> 19:17.066

- Hudson's Bay, HB.

19:19.934 --> 19:21.433
- Oh, it's got the date
on the back, too?

19:21.567 --> 19:23.066
- 1773.

19:23.200 --> 19:24.934
- I was immediately drawn
to it.

19:25.066 --> 19:26.800
I'm literally holding a piece
of history

19:26.934 --> 19:29.700
in my hands right now,
and it's unbelievable.

19:29.834 --> 19:31.734

thing we've found so far.

19:31.867 --> 19:33.400

- He was quite intrigued.

19:33.533 --> 19:35.300
And the thing is over
200 years old -

19:35.433 --> 19:37.467
it's just very neat to hold.

19:38.767 --> 19:40.166
Narrator: In 1670,

19:40.300 --> 19:42.467
King Charles II granted
the Hudson's Bay Company

19:42.600 --> 19:46.166
a charter that claimed some
1.5 million square kilometers

19:46.300 --> 19:49.800
of land inhabited by Inuit
and First Nations communities.

19:49.934 --> 19:53.266
This ultimately opened up
the continent for colonization

19:53.400 --> 19:55.934
and that lead directly
to the devastation

19:56.066 --> 19:58.500
of indigenous people
across North America.

19:58.633 --> 20:01.834
By the mid 19th century,
HBC's land holdings

20:01.967 --> 20:04.767
grew to some 8 million
square kilometers.

20:04.900 --> 20:08.633
In 1848, a busy trading post
was opened in Sturgeon Falls.

20:08.767 --> 20:11.567
This outpost was
the commercial hub

20:11.700 --> 20:13.433

20:13.567 --> 20:15.333
when the Canadian Pacific
Railway arrived.

20:16.533 --> 20:18.367

value is here,

20:18.500 --> 20:20.033

20:20.166 --> 20:21.166
- Is that including
the tugboat?

20:21.300 --> 20:23.300
- The whole salvage,
everything, yeah.

20:23.433 --> 20:25.166
- Twelve grand worth?

20:25.300 --> 20:27.033
- You're a little light,
you're a little light.

20:27.166 --> 20:28.934
- Well, I was gonna say
15 grand.

20:29.066 --> 20:30.934
- Yeah, I think you're pretty
close on 15 grand here.

20:31.066 --> 20:32.834

of it.

20:32.967 --> 20:35.934
- You're getting it.
A couple of days, 15 grand.

it's a great salvage.

worth it. I love it.

- Yeah, that's what I said.

27:05.300 --> 27:07.834
I don't think so. Six tons will
get $1200 bucks.

27:07.967 --> 27:10.734
- Come on!
- $1200 bucks, no way.

27:10.867 --> 27:12.633
- Ugh...
- No way.

27:12.767 --> 27:15.266
We're not scrapping
an historical piece like that.

27:25.600 --> 27:27.000
Justin: Who was that?

27:27.133 --> 27:28.967
Ted: A guy calling about
the tugboat.

27:29.100 --> 27:30.800
I'm not scrapping that thing.
- No, no way.

27:30.934 --> 27:32.767
- It's history too, you know?

27:32.900 --> 27:34.700
How'd you make out?
You wrapped up?

27:34.834 --> 27:36.600
- Yeah, everything's clean,
everything's good.

27:36.734 --> 27:38.500
Township's happy,
owners are happy.

27:38.633 --> 27:40.266
What's next?
- I dunno. I just left Ron,

27:40.400 --> 27:42.500
he's working on the truck.
- The truck?

27:42.633 --> 27:44.467
- Yeah.
- I gotta go see this.

27:44.600 --> 27:46.367
- All right. Go check him.
I'll sell that tugboat.

27:46.500 --> 27:47.700
- Cheers, man.

27:47.834 --> 27:49.800
- I'm gonna try and sell
that tugboat anyhow.

27:49.934 --> 27:55.600
♪♪

27:55.734 --> 27:57.033
- Hey, so what do you think?

27:57.166 --> 27:59.367
- That I'm not sure we have
a spark.

27:59.500 --> 28:01.300
And it won't start
unless we have a spark.

28:01.433 --> 28:03.767
The most difficult step
in getting this truck going

28:03.900 --> 28:06.500
will be to ensure that
there's ignition,

28:06.633 --> 28:08.033
which means there's a spark.

28:08.166 --> 28:10.100
I know we have fuel,
and I know we're turning over,

28:10.233 --> 28:13.066
but it won't start
unless we have a spark.

28:16.800 --> 28:18.667
- Hey.
- Hey.

28:18.800 --> 28:20.333
- Looks brand new compared
to this one.

28:20.467 --> 28:22.333
Narrator: Ted and Brandon clean
up the Sturgeon Falls salvage

28:22.467 --> 28:23.767
in the workshop...

28:23.900 --> 28:25.533
- Oh, there you go.
- Watch your hands.

28:25.667 --> 28:26.967
Narrator: While Maya looks
for an expert

28:27.100 --> 28:29.767
to authenticate the Hudson's
Bay Company amulet.

28:29.900 --> 28:31.900
- I'll work on this, just get
the grease off of this thing.

28:32.033 --> 28:33.633
- Yeah, I can do that.

28:33.767 --> 28:35.500
- Maya, how are you making out
with that amulet?

28:35.633 --> 28:36.967
- Uh, nothing yet.
- Nothing?

28:37.100 --> 28:38.767
- No. But I'm working on it.

28:38.900 --> 28:40.767
- Check museums and stuff
like that, right?

28:40.900 --> 28:43.166
'Cause they're the ones
that would know.

28:44.500 --> 28:46.400
(Door opens)

28:49.567 --> 28:51.200
How're you doing?
- Hey, Ted?

28:51.333 --> 28:52.900
- Yes, sir.
- Hey, my name's Aaron.

28:53.033 --> 28:54.767
How are you?
- Good to meet you, man.

28:54.900 --> 28:56.667
- I was talking to you about
some duck decoys.

28:56.800 --> 28:58.834
- Oh yeah, we got some here.
- Perfect.

28:58.967 --> 29:00.834
- Came here today to speak
to Ted.

29:00.967 --> 29:03.133
He said he had some vintage
hunting decoys.

29:03.266 --> 29:05.166
I got some friends
who are big into collecting

29:05.300 --> 29:07.834
hunting antiques,
that vintage style.

29:07.967 --> 29:09.934
- Boat motors, ducks, traps.

29:10.066 --> 29:12.467
- These decoys,
they're plastic.

29:12.600 --> 29:14.266
You don't have anything older,
eh?

29:14.400 --> 29:16.567
Hand carved, made of wood,
nothing like that?

29:16.700 --> 29:18.166
- Yeah, we got some wood ones.
- Yeah?

29:18.300 --> 29:19.834
- I think I got a couple,
actually.

29:19.967 --> 29:21.967
- Some nice pieces right there.
- Perfect.

29:22.100 --> 29:23.700
- They're beautiful,
look at them.

29:23.834 --> 29:25.734
- Yeah, the workmanship
on them is great.

29:25.867 --> 29:29.633
- These decoys are hand-carved,
little folk-art pieces.

29:29.767 --> 29:32.166
They got glass eyes.
Just beautiful.

29:32.300 --> 29:33.900
We had 10 of these,
these are our last two.

29:34.033 --> 29:35.500
- Really, eh?

29:35.633 --> 29:37.400
- Yeah, the other ones sold
quick.

29:37.533 --> 29:38.834
- Yeah, what're you selling
these for?

29:38.967 --> 29:42.433
- $125 each.
- Yeah, that's... all right.

29:42.567 --> 29:44.233
What about $100?
- $100?

29:44.367 --> 29:47.967
- $100 each?
- I gotta do a buck 25 each.

29:48.100 --> 29:50.834
- Ted is a pro. Watching him
with customers,

29:50.967 --> 29:53.300
it's like watching a sales
master class.

29:53.433 --> 29:55.600
- $125 each, eh?
- Yeah, that's a good deal.

29:55.734 --> 29:58.834
They're nicely carved,
nice display piece.

29:58.967 --> 30:01.600
- $125 each is pretty good.
- I think so, right?

30:01.734 --> 30:03.100
- I think I'll take them.
- Good?

30:03.233 --> 30:04.633
- Yeah.
- Let's go write it up.

30:04.767 --> 30:06.467
- Sounds good to me.
- You see my caboose out there?

30:06.600 --> 30:08.934
- Yeah, that's great looking.
- Yeah, pretty cool office, eh?

30:10.867 --> 30:12.600
(Rumbling)

30:16.500 --> 30:18.500
Narrator: Ron and Justin
continue to work on the truck,

30:18.633 --> 30:20.633
but progress is slow.

30:20.767 --> 30:22.033
- Okay, Justin.

30:22.166 --> 30:25.600
- I think we should just hold
the plug like that.

30:25.734 --> 30:26.967
- I think you should do
that part.

30:27.100 --> 30:28.734
- (Laughing) I bet.
- Go to your right.

30:28.867 --> 30:30.166
Justin volunteers to hold
the spark plug

30:30.300 --> 30:31.834
which is fine with me.

30:31.967 --> 30:33.834
There's like 36,000 volts
coming there.

30:33.967 --> 30:36.400
- Make sure you're
well insulated, buddy,

30:36.533 --> 30:37.967
'cause this gonna light you up.

30:38.100 --> 30:39.900
- I know. Okay!

30:40.033 --> 30:42.133
- This should be fun.
- (Laughs) For you!

30:42.266 --> 30:44.066
- Let me know if it goes,
all right?

30:44.200 --> 30:46.834
- Okay, if you hear me yell,
please stop cranking it.

30:46.967 --> 30:50.433
- You ready, Justin?
- Yeah, man.
- All right.

30:50.567 --> 30:52.834
(Blows out his breath,
engine stutters)

30:52.967 --> 30:55.166
- Holding the spark plug
is not recommended.

30:55.300 --> 30:57.600
Getting a spark indicates
the electrical system's

30:57.734 --> 30:59.266
actually working in the truck.

30:59.400 --> 31:01.133
You just hold the plug
near the engine

31:01.266 --> 31:03.867
with the coil wire on,
you'll see a beautiful spark.

31:05.233 --> 31:07.333
(Spark buzzes)
Hey! There's a spark!

31:07.467 --> 31:09.533
- That's amazing, bro.
- Found the spark!

31:09.667 --> 31:12.333
We know there's a spark.
- All right.

31:12.467 --> 31:14.133
So what we're gonna have
to try to do is...

31:14.266 --> 31:16.300
we can remove that air filter

31:16.433 --> 31:18.700
and go directly in the carb.
- Yeah.

31:18.834 --> 31:20.000
- Give it some juice.
All right?

31:20.133 --> 31:22.000
So, that's what we're gonna do.

31:22.133 --> 31:23.900
- Ron is an old school mechanic

31:24.033 --> 31:27.367
and he's actually fixing things
and I'm learning.

31:27.500 --> 31:29.100
(Rumbling)

31:31.767 --> 31:33.500
- Hey.
- So good news.
- Yeah.

31:33.633 --> 31:35.000
- I found an expert.
- Yes.

31:35.133 --> 31:36.800
- I sent them a bunch of
pictures,

31:36.934 --> 31:38.200
so they already know what
they're dealing with here.

31:38.333 --> 31:39.900
- Perfect, set it up.
- Okay.

31:40.033 --> 31:41.900
Amelia was really into
the amulet.

31:42.033 --> 31:43.900
She wanted to talk to us
right away.

31:44.033 --> 31:45.800
- Hi Amelia!
- Hi, it's nice to,

31:45.934 --> 31:47.967
nice to meet both of you.
Both: Nice to meet you too!

31:48.100 --> 31:49.467
- Somewhat, technically.

31:49.600 --> 31:51.133
- You sent along some really
nice photos

31:51.266 --> 31:53.433
and I was able to take
a close look.

31:53.567 --> 31:55.667
Really interesting piece
that you've found.

31:55.800 --> 31:59.567
But unfortunately, it's not
an authentic HBC amulet.

31:59.700 --> 32:01.633
- I was worried about that.

32:03.100 --> 32:05.433
- So, there's a few things
that I saw in the photos

32:05.567 --> 32:07.433
that I thought, okay,
maybe that's not authentic,

32:07.567 --> 32:10.433
and that's largely
the conjoined HB.

32:10.567 --> 32:12.533
- Yeah.
- Hudson's Bay Company

32:12.667 --> 32:14.400
sometimes used that
conjoined HB,

32:14.533 --> 32:17.834
but not often do I see
something like an amulet.

32:19.333 --> 32:22.200
This isn't really looking
too authentic to me.

32:22.333 --> 32:23.834
- Right.

32:23.967 --> 32:25.834
- There is a real HBC amulet

32:25.967 --> 32:28.300
that's in the Canadian Museum
of History's collection.

32:28.433 --> 32:30.500
It has kind of a similar vein,
right?

32:30.633 --> 32:33.400
So, I think they're copying
that sort of design

32:33.533 --> 32:35.834
to make this particular piece.

32:35.967 --> 32:38.033
- What, what would be the
purpose of copying this?

32:38.166 --> 32:40.033
- There's a lot of people
that are really fascinated

32:40.166 --> 32:41.834
in fur trade history.

32:41.967 --> 32:43.834
There's quite a few items that
people will spend money on.

32:43.967 --> 32:45.266
Therefore, I'm gonna make
a forgery

32:45.400 --> 32:46.967
to try and get some money.
- Oh, yeah,

32:47.100 --> 32:48.967
it's been going on for years,
right?

32:49.100 --> 32:51.700
- Yeah. Forgeries, to me,
are also pretty fascinating.

32:51.834 --> 32:53.967
To me, it's, it's got
historical significance.

32:54.100 --> 32:55.967
Both: Yeah.

32:56.100 --> 32:58.033
- It's still part of how
people connect with that.

32:58.166 --> 33:00.600
I do actually see on the market
quite a few forgeries

33:00.734 --> 33:03.033
and, and pieces,
not just amulets.

33:03.166 --> 33:05.133
- It's still cool to me.
- Yeah.

33:05.266 --> 33:07.633
- I could wear it around.
- You could wear it on your
neck.

33:07.767 --> 33:09.433
- (Chuckles) Yeah!
- Well, thank you so much

33:09.567 --> 33:11.667
for all that info.
We really appreciate your time.

33:11.800 --> 33:13.800
- Yeah.
- Yeah, it's always nice

33:13.934 --> 33:15.500
to talk to other people
that are interested

33:15.633 --> 33:17.900
in artifacts and treasures.
- Thanks so much, Amelia.

33:18.033 --> 33:20.000
- Yeah, thank you. Bye-bye.
Both: Bye.

33:20.133 --> 33:22.033
- Well, what can we do?

33:22.166 --> 33:23.934
- I was obviously hoping
it'd be real

33:24.066 --> 33:25.800
'cause what a cool museum
piece, but my God...

33:25.934 --> 33:27.600
- Yeah.
- It's a cool story, I like it.

33:27.734 --> 33:29.800
All right, see you later, Ted.
- See you, Maya.

33:29.934 --> 33:34.700
♪♪

33:34.834 --> 33:36.834
Narrator: It's a new day
and the team is still

33:36.967 --> 33:38.900
sorting through the Sturgeon
Falls salvage,

33:39.033 --> 33:41.467
when one of Ted's regular
customers drops by.

33:41.600 --> 33:43.467
- What's new and exciting?
- There's Max!

33:43.600 --> 33:45.567
What's up, buddy?
- Hey.

33:45.700 --> 33:47.033
- What do you think of
the new yard?

33:47.166 --> 33:48.700
- Nice, nice.
- How're you doing?

33:48.834 --> 33:50.333
- Good seeing you.
I do special effects

33:50.467 --> 33:52.033
in film and television.

33:52.166 --> 33:54.166
I do a lot of movies that are
period pieces.

33:54.300 --> 33:56.600
I come to the table with,
you know, one stop shopping -

33:56.734 --> 33:58.800
the effects, the explosion,
the truck.

33:58.934 --> 34:01.533
What's with the traps?
Keeping your trap shut?

34:01.667 --> 34:03.633
- Yeah.
All: (Laughing)

34:03.767 --> 34:05.700
- We just, we salvaged
a trapper's place.

34:05.834 --> 34:08.100
- This is all very interesting,
but where's the truck?

34:08.233 --> 34:09.867
- Let's go. Let's go.

34:10.000 --> 34:12.400
Max is a special effects guru.

34:12.533 --> 34:16.100
He does a lot of war movies,
documentaries, TV series.

34:16.233 --> 34:18.233
He's gonna love this truck.

34:18.367 --> 34:19.700
Here we go.

34:19.834 --> 34:21.266
- Do you have it in any other
colour?

34:21.400 --> 34:23.834
I look for trucks that are
versatile, that I can work on,

34:23.967 --> 34:25.967
and I can make them into,
you know, whatever I want.

34:26.100 --> 34:27.567
Interesting truck.

34:27.700 --> 34:29.433
Justin: Beautiful truck.
Ted: It's beautiful.

34:29.567 --> 34:31.166
Max: It's a military-looking
truck,

34:31.300 --> 34:35.767
World War II ambulance,
Korean War command truck.

34:35.900 --> 34:37.734
So, it's four-wheel drive?
- Yup.

34:37.867 --> 34:39.633
- What's the frame like?
- Frame is gorgeous.

34:39.767 --> 34:41.400
Take a look, it's like new.

34:41.533 --> 34:43.100
- Considering the age of this
truck,

34:43.233 --> 34:44.934
it's in really good shape.
- Yeah.

34:45.066 --> 34:46.734
How little do you want
for this? I mean...

34:46.867 --> 34:48.767
- (Laughing)
- I have been looking them up

34:48.900 --> 34:51.467
and they're all over the map,
but... if we got it running

34:51.600 --> 34:53.333
and we went through
all the gears,

34:53.467 --> 34:55.300
it's gotta be worth 10.
- Ten?!

34:55.433 --> 34:57.433
- Ten, running. Yeah, if it's
running around the yard, 10.

34:57.567 --> 34:59.200
Look at it, it's very rare.

34:59.333 --> 35:01.300
There's less than a thousand
of these made.

35:01.433 --> 35:03.734
- I've dreamt all kinds
of things, but uh...

35:03.867 --> 35:06.033
Let's start the thing up
and see if it does start

35:06.166 --> 35:07.767
and then we can start talking.

35:07.900 --> 35:10.033
- All right, I'll fire it up.
- Yeah.

35:12.033 --> 35:13.233
(Door bangs shut)
- You ready, Ron?

35:13.367 --> 35:15.467
- Are you ready to go, Justin?
- Yup. Hands are clear.

35:15.600 --> 35:17.166
- All right, fire in the hole.

35:17.300 --> 35:19.266
(Engine stutters)

35:25.333 --> 35:27.033
- Ron!
- Hey!

35:27.166 --> 35:29.033
- It's not turning over
fast enough.

35:29.166 --> 35:30.934
