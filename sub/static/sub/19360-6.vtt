Shane Smith:
<i>This week on "Vice,"</i>

00:08.390 --> 00:13.260
<i>the ongoing battle over the billions
of dollars earned in college sports.</i>

00:14.763 --> 00:16.463
Kirby Hocutt: They're
going to school for free.

00:16.498 --> 00:18.799
We're meeting
all of their needs.

00:18.834 --> 00:21.134
You might make a lot of money
if you get into the pros,

00:21.169 --> 00:24.070
<i>and yet, less than one percent
of the people make it.</i>

00:25.707 --> 00:27.740
Each round,
each pick that goes by

00:27.775 --> 00:30.743
means less money for him
if he eventually gets picked.

00:30.778 --> 00:33.213
Do you think you would
have left college early

00:33.248 --> 00:36.548
if you had been, in some way,
compensated throughout college?

00:36.583 --> 00:38.350
No, honestly.

00:45.392 --> 00:46.458
Go, go, go!

00:49.563 --> 00:50.863
Refugee:
We are not animals!

01:02.308 --> 01:03.941
The cost for broadcast rights

01:03.977 --> 01:06.510
to air the games of
professional sports has soared

01:06.545 --> 01:08.579
<i>over the last 10 years,</i>

01:08.614 --> 01:10.780
<i>generating billions
upon billions of dollars</i>

01:10.815 --> 01:12.315
<i>for their respective leagues.</i>

01:12.351 --> 01:16.186
Pro-athletes have had
a share in these rising profits.

01:16.221 --> 01:18.821
However, college
athletes haven't.

01:18.857 --> 01:21.892
<i>Now next week, college
basketball's biggest draw,</i>

01:21.927 --> 01:23.193
<i>the NCAA Final Four,</i>

01:23.228 --> 01:24.761
comes to a close.

01:24.796 --> 01:27.229
A single 30-second ad
during this event

01:27.265 --> 01:29.098
<i>costs more than
a million dollars.</i>

01:29.133 --> 01:34.069
In fact, the NCAA will make around
a billion dollars this year,

01:34.105 --> 01:36.071
but the NCAA forbids

01:36.107 --> 01:38.807
<i>any kind of compensation
for college players</i>

01:38.842 --> 01:41.210
beyond the cost
of their college education.

01:41.245 --> 01:44.279
Now many see this
as exploitation and unfair,

01:44.314 --> 01:47.548
given that most college athletes
won't make it to the pros.

01:47.583 --> 01:51.752
Gianna Toboni spent a year following
both sides of this growing debate.

02:14.443 --> 02:17.177
Toboni: <i>College sports
have become so popular</i>

02:17.212 --> 02:18.811
<i>that the five
biggest conferences</i>

02:18.846 --> 02:22.648
<i>made more than
$6 billion last year alone.</i>

02:22.683 --> 02:25.851
<i>With so much money being made off
of games played by college kids,</i>

02:25.886 --> 02:28.887
<i>we wanted to understand the demands
of being a student athlete.</i>

02:28.923 --> 02:31.590
<i>So, we caught up with Michigan
State's basketball team</i>

02:31.625 --> 02:34.060
<i>as they flew on
a privately chartered jet.</i>

02:58.784 --> 03:00.717
Do most people see it
as a full-time job?

03:24.309 --> 03:28.710
Toboni: <i> And what they want it to add
up to is the next step, the pros.</i>

03:36.020 --> 03:37.319
Toboni:
<i>While that dream is common,</i>

03:37.354 --> 03:39.587
<i>Hall of Fame coach,
Tom Izzo explained to us</i>

03:39.623 --> 03:41.789
<i>how rare achieving it
actually is.</i>

03:54.470 --> 03:55.569
Toboni: Yeah.

04:07.849 --> 04:09.615
Toboni: <i>While the vast
majority of these players</i>

04:09.651 --> 04:10.950
<i>never make it to the pros,</i>

04:10.985 --> 04:13.153
<i>the NCAA identifies
them as amateurs,</i>

04:13.188 --> 04:16.622
<i>strictly forbidding them from profiting
off of not just their ability,</i>

04:16.658 --> 04:18.822
<i>but their name,
image and likeness.</i>

04:18.858 --> 04:20.791
<i>This led to a now infamous case,</i>

04:20.827 --> 04:22.694
<i>brought by former
player, Ed O'Bannon,</i>

04:22.729 --> 04:25.997
<i>who sued the NCAA for
profiting off of his likeness</i>

04:26.033 --> 04:28.500
<i>over a decade
after he left school.</i>

04:28.536 --> 04:30.669
Close to 15 years later...

04:30.704 --> 04:34.405
uh, and they're still
making money off of...

04:34.441 --> 04:35.441
off of my image.

04:35.475 --> 04:37.007
Toboni: <i>The federal
court system decided</i>

04:37.043 --> 04:40.978
<i>that the NCAA's amateurism rules
were an unlawful restraint of trade,</i>

04:41.013 --> 04:44.582
<i>but the ruling did not call for
schools to pay the players directly.</i>

04:44.617 --> 04:47.051
<i>Some players think
they're being ripped off,</i>

04:47.087 --> 04:49.287
<i>and a new lawsuit
is directly challenging</i>

04:49.322 --> 04:51.021
<i>the NCAA's model.</i>

04:51.057 --> 04:52.822
O'Bannon and other cases
have targeted

04:52.857 --> 04:55.925
certain elements
of the NCAA's business model.

04:55.961 --> 04:59.496
Your case would fundamentally
change college sports.

04:59.531 --> 05:02.532
We hope it will fundamentally
change college sports.

05:02.568 --> 05:05.535
Toboni: <i>Jeffrey Kessler
changed the NBA and NFL</i>

05:05.571 --> 05:07.504
<i>after pursuing
groundbreaking litigation</i>

05:07.539 --> 05:11.574
<i>that freed up players to bargain for
much higher salaries as free agents.</i>

05:11.609 --> 05:14.977
What these players want
is fair treatment.

05:15.012 --> 05:17.446
That's all that they've
ever been seeking.

05:17.482 --> 05:19.248
The players will get
their day in court.

05:19.283 --> 05:23.285
Toboni: <i>And now Kessler has
trained his sights on the NCAA.</i>

05:23.321 --> 05:24.620
These athletes,

05:24.655 --> 05:26.020
they don't get paid,

05:26.055 --> 05:27.455
but everybody else does.

05:27.491 --> 05:29.257
It's not fair,
and it's not legal.

05:29.292 --> 05:34.829
What we're trying to do is empower
the schools and the conferences

05:34.864 --> 05:39.567
to make their own choices about
what's fair for the players.

05:39.603 --> 05:40.835
That's all. Very simple.

05:40.870 --> 05:43.170
This is a freedom
of choice case.

05:43.205 --> 05:45.272
Toboni:
<i>Former Clemson cornerback,</i>

05:45.307 --> 05:48.175
<i>Martin Jenkins is leading
the charge in this new case.</i>

05:48.210 --> 05:49.409
<i>While playing
for a sports program</i>

05:49.445 --> 05:52.746
<i>that brought in more than $70
million in revenue a year,</i>

05:52.781 --> 05:54.281
<i>he was not allowed to profit.</i>

05:54.316 --> 05:56.816
Announcer: Jenkins to
the 10, and he scores!

05:56.852 --> 05:58.485
Why did you join this lawsuit?

05:58.521 --> 06:01.387
I don't want to see
college athletes struggle

06:01.422 --> 06:04.223
when the school that they're
working for, technically,

06:04.259 --> 06:06.292
is making hundreds of millions
of dollars off of them.

06:06.327 --> 06:08.227
Did you expect
to make it to the NFL?

06:08.263 --> 06:09.895
Absolutely, absolutely.

06:09.930 --> 06:12.131
What happened when you
graduated college?

06:12.167 --> 06:13.866
Jenkins: I had four
surgeries in college.

06:13.901 --> 06:15.701
Tore my labrum,
had surgery on that.

06:15.736 --> 06:18.102
Tore my groin,
had surgery on that.

06:18.138 --> 06:20.405
I tore a ligament in my foot,
had surgery on that,

06:20.440 --> 06:23.208
and I tore a ligament in my
thumb, had surgery on that.

06:23.243 --> 06:25.644
When I graduated, I initially
went to a training camp,

06:25.679 --> 06:27.879
went to rookie camp
with the... the New York Jets.

06:27.914 --> 06:30.915
Same kinda thing persisted,
had some injuries.

06:30.950 --> 06:32.750
So after giving it
a couple tries, I said,

06:32.786 --> 06:35.286
"You know, it's...
it's kinda time to hang it up."

06:35.321 --> 06:39.056
You spent years,
uh, playing football

06:39.091 --> 06:41.825
and suffering injuries,
and you couldn't profit

06:41.860 --> 06:44.094
off of your athletic ability during
those years. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

06:44.129 --> 06:47.631
You graduated, and it was injuries that,
in part, took you out of the game.

06:47.667 --> 06:52.669
Do you think that your prime earning
years were when you were in college?

06:52.704 --> 06:55.071
Yeah, I can actually
agree with that. Yes.

06:55.106 --> 07:00.376
The case that... that you guys are bringing could
really change the future of college sports.

07:00.412 --> 07:04.013
In a very strong, positive way.

07:04.048 --> 07:06.482
If the schools are allowed

07:06.518 --> 07:09.251
to decide how to
compensate these players,

07:09.286 --> 07:11.553
we believe they'll do the right
thing and the fair thing.

07:11.589 --> 07:14.923
So schools wouldn't be required to
pay athletes, they'd be allowed to?

07:14.958 --> 07:17.058
That's right. That's something
that the market would decide.

07:17.094 --> 07:21.363
Just like the market for
anybody else in entertainment,

07:21.398 --> 07:24.932
or anybody else in sports,
or anybody else who has a job.

07:24.967 --> 07:29.403
You let the employers decide
what's the fair competition,

07:29.439 --> 07:32.840
and then the marketplace
reaches a decision on that.

07:32.875 --> 07:34.408
The money is there.

07:34.444 --> 07:35.909
Toboni: <i>That same
approach was applied</i>

07:35.945 --> 07:37.778
<i>to free agency in pro sports.</i>

07:37.813 --> 07:39.614
<i>Just as that market
was ballooning</i>

07:39.649 --> 07:41.681
<i>as new broadcasting,
and licensing deals</i>

07:41.717 --> 07:44.784
<i>added billions to bottom lines.</i>

07:44.819 --> 07:47.487
<i>But introducing a free
market in college sports,</i>

07:47.522 --> 07:50.923
<i>could spark even
more dramatic effects.</i>

07:50.959 --> 07:53.526
<i>We wanted to understand
both sides of this debate,</i>

07:53.562 --> 07:55.629
<i>but the NCAA and 30 universities</i>

07:55.664 --> 07:57.997
<i>declined our request
to speak on the topic.</i>

07:58.032 --> 08:01.600
<i>One of the few schools willing
to talk to us was Texas Tech.</i>

08:03.337 --> 08:04.603
Let's go!

08:19.018 --> 08:20.918
It's college football
season in Texas.

08:20.953 --> 08:24.121
We're at Texas Tech,
they're playing KU,

08:24.157 --> 08:27.091
and fans are going nuts.

08:29.462 --> 08:31.195
Toboni: <i>Texas Tech is
expected to generate</i>

08:31.230 --> 08:33.929
<i>$80 million in revenue
this year alone,</i>

08:33.965 --> 08:36.099
<i>but as Athletic Director
Kirby Hocutt showed us,</i>

08:36.134 --> 08:38.635
<i>the debate over player pay
becomes more complicated</i>

08:38.671 --> 08:41.837
<i>when the cost of running a Division
One athletics program is considered.</i>

08:41.873 --> 08:44.073
This is our football
training facility.

08:44.109 --> 08:46.476
This is the hub
of Texas Tech football.

08:48.880 --> 08:51.681
Take a peek into our team
meeting room facility.

08:51.716 --> 08:53.182
It's our team meeting room.

08:53.217 --> 08:57.687
It gives Coach Kingsbury an opportunity
to address the entire team at one time.

08:57.722 --> 08:59.655
Toboni: I don't think
I've been in a nicer

08:59.691 --> 09:02.291
corporate meeting room
than... than this one.

09:02.327 --> 09:03.392
It serves its purpose.

09:03.428 --> 09:08.730
Texas Tech University
has invested over $200 million

09:08.765 --> 09:13.134
in the last decade
into its athletic facilities.

09:13.169 --> 09:15.236
Toboni: <i>Hundreds of millions
of dollars are invested</i>

09:15.271 --> 09:18.139
<i>directly into expenses
like world-class facilities,</i>

09:18.174 --> 09:20.775
<i>and personal salaries.</i>

09:20.811 --> 09:23.877
<i>But while the coaches and
administrators are compensated well,</i>

09:23.912 --> 09:28.081
<i>what they're able to provide
athletes is closely regulated.</i>

09:28.116 --> 09:33.019
There's always sandwiches,
lunch meats, bagels.

09:33.055 --> 09:36.623
Toboni: So, before a couple years
ago, you couldn't have sandwiches,

09:36.659 --> 09:39.159
and Gatorade's and things
for the student athletes.

09:39.194 --> 09:42.762
You were limited in what type
of snacks you could provide,

09:42.797 --> 09:44.364
and when you
could provide those.

09:44.399 --> 09:46.699
The NCAA's taken
great steps forward.

09:48.403 --> 09:50.870
Toboni: <i>Does the Athletic
Department turn a profit?</i>

09:50.905 --> 09:53.973
We do. We, uh...
we've been in a...

09:54.008 --> 09:55.641
a positive financial position

09:55.677 --> 09:59.811
for the five years that I've
been at Texas Tech University.

09:59.847 --> 10:03.582
The Athletics Department
in the past 15 years

10:03.617 --> 10:08.253
has invested over $300 million
into our athletic facilities.

10:08.288 --> 10:12.891
We have 415 student athletes
competing in 17 sports.

10:12.926 --> 10:14.558
They are receiving
a free education,

10:14.594 --> 10:17.428
that's covering their tuition,
their fees, room, books,

10:17.463 --> 10:21.432
and then board... their living expenses.
And then on top of that,

10:21.467 --> 10:26.437
this is our second year to provide cost of
attendance on top of the full scholarship.

10:26.472 --> 10:32.542
At Texas Tech University, the full cost
of attendance is an additional $4,820.

10:32.577 --> 10:34.544
If the day comes,

10:34.579 --> 10:36.880
and there are
additional payments

10:36.915 --> 10:41.684
to... to select student
athletes that are required,

10:41.720 --> 10:44.854
you have to consider
elimination of opportunities.

10:44.890 --> 10:48.724
I've been in a position before where
I've had to eliminate sport programs,

10:48.759 --> 10:52.761
and I hope that I'm not
in that position ever again

10:52.797 --> 10:56.732
to have to take opportunities
away from young people.

10:56.767 --> 10:59.000
Toboni: <i>While colleges say
they need this revenue</i>

10:59.036 --> 11:01.637
<i>to provide scholarships,
programs and facilities</i>

11:01.672 --> 11:03.572
<i>economists like Rodney Fort
see nothing</i>

11:03.607 --> 11:06.774
<i>but record growth
and record spending.</i>

11:06.810 --> 11:10.311
All schools can afford
to pay players. All of them.

11:11.414 --> 11:12.713
Fort: <i>If my revenues
and expenditures</i>

11:12.749 --> 11:13.981
<i>are going up at the same rate,</i>

11:14.016 --> 11:17.384
<i>because money that's being
generated by players</i>

11:17.420 --> 11:22.289
is being spent on coaches, and
administrators and facilities,

11:22.325 --> 11:25.258
then the money to pay
the players is already there.

11:25.293 --> 11:30.129
The fact that you're not allocating
the money to the players

11:30.165 --> 11:32.231
doesn't mean that you couldn't,

11:32.267 --> 11:34.634
and that's the... you know,
that's the... the fallacy.

11:34.670 --> 11:37.671
How has the NCAA changed
over the last 30 years?

11:37.706 --> 11:42.341
The rise and impact
of, um... of television,

11:42.376 --> 11:44.610
and now video streaming,

11:44.645 --> 11:46.846
it's changed it into an activity

11:46.881 --> 11:49.882
where the conferences that
can generate the most money

11:49.917 --> 11:51.757
are also in control
of how it gets distributed.

11:51.786 --> 11:54.453
The reason that
amateurism exists

11:54.489 --> 11:58.389
is because it allows
the university discretion

11:58.424 --> 12:00.692
over a larger portion
of the amount of revenues

12:00.727 --> 12:04.061
that get generated by the Athletic
Department than they would otherwise have,

12:04.097 --> 12:06.664
and that discretion comes
at the expense of the athletes.

12:06.700 --> 12:10.502
Is there something contradictory
about schools making money

12:10.537 --> 12:12.770
any way they can
off of college sports

12:12.806 --> 12:15.038
and then not
allowing the athletes,

12:15.073 --> 12:18.709
who arguably are the ones generating
the money, make a profit.

12:18.744 --> 12:23.780
Many people wonder if this
is an outright exploitation.

12:23.816 --> 12:25.415
As an economist,
I look at that and say,

12:25.450 --> 12:27.150
"Well, yes, that's exactly
what they're doing."

12:27.185 --> 12:30.353
Toboni: <i>But the NCAA goes farther
than preventing athletes</i>

12:30.389 --> 12:32.454
<i>from sharing in
the school's revenues.</i>

12:32.490 --> 12:35.090
<i>Their 400-page rule book
prohibits the athletes</i>

12:35.126 --> 12:37.894
<i>from making any money off
of their athletic ability.</i>

12:37.929 --> 12:39.729
<i>So each year, new controversies</i>

12:39.764 --> 12:41.463
<i>make headlines
across the country.</i>

12:41.499 --> 12:43.900
<i>but what many don't know
is that these same rules</i>

12:43.935 --> 12:47.602
<i>apply to athletes before they
even graduate high school.</i>

13:09.091 --> 13:11.391
So, we're at Under Armour's
AAU Tournament,

13:11.427 --> 13:13.827
and all of these high school kids
are showing off their skills

13:13.863 --> 13:16.630
for all the top college coaches
that are sitting right here.

13:21.003 --> 13:23.803
And everyone here
is wearing Under Armour.

13:30.879 --> 13:33.046
Toboni: <i> We asked Coach
Antoinette Bennett to explain</i>

13:33.081 --> 13:34.513
<i>how Under Armour
benefits from hosting</i>

13:34.549 --> 13:36.983
<i>these tournaments
for high school athletes.</i>

13:51.098 --> 13:53.264
Toboni: <i>One of Coach Bennett's
players, David Beatty,</i>

13:53.300 --> 13:55.633
<i>was among the top
prospects of this tournament.</i>

13:55.668 --> 13:58.502
<i>He explained how this branding
works for the athletes.</i>

14:37.074 --> 14:39.474
Toboni: <i>The reason these brands
give these kids free gear</i>

14:39.510 --> 14:41.877
<i>is because it amounts
to free advertising.</i>

14:41.912 --> 14:46.115
<i>Something that became clear
when we visited David's home.</i>

14:48.584 --> 14:50.484
Toboni: Holy shit.

14:50.520 --> 14:52.620
David: Cause I've got
sneakers in my mom's car,

14:52.656 --> 14:54.455
I have sneakers
at my friend's house.

14:54.490 --> 14:59.727
You can pick out any basketball shoe,
and I got a story for each one.

14:59.763 --> 15:02.163
Toboni: What about the
Terminator ones on the end?

15:03.332 --> 15:05.666
I got those
for Dick's Nationals.

15:05.701 --> 15:08.535
Played on ESPN in them
for like five minutes.

15:08.570 --> 15:10.971
Started hurting my feet, took 'em off.

15:11.006 --> 15:13.840
David: First time I wore
'em, last time I wore 'em.

15:13.876 --> 15:15.676
Toboni: How much do you
think it's all worth?

15:17.079 --> 15:19.046
Probably like $10,000?

15:20.315 --> 15:22.148
Toboni: Because you're not
getting paid right now,

15:22.183 --> 15:24.216
why not just sell your shoes?

15:24.251 --> 15:25.918
Help out your family?

15:25.953 --> 15:28.353
Because with the NCAA rules,

15:28.389 --> 15:32.491
it's like a violation, and they'll
try to, like, investigate

15:32.526 --> 15:36.461
and do all this other
crazy stuff just to, like,

15:36.497 --> 15:38.963
stop me from going to college
and playing basketball.

15:38.999 --> 15:40.932
Toboni:
<i>Even during high school,</i>

15:40.967 --> 15:42.667
<i>a violation of NCAA rules</i>

15:42.703 --> 15:44.135
<i>could cost David
a chance at going</i>

15:44.171 --> 15:47.839
<i>to one of the many colleges
which are recruiting him.</i>

15:47.874 --> 15:50.141
"We love you, and we care
about you, and we want you."

15:50.177 --> 15:54.045
Toboni: <i> And dozens of universities are
offering him that exact opportunity</i>

15:54.081 --> 15:56.613
<i>as long as he follows
the NCAA rules.</i>

15:56.648 --> 15:58.315
How you feel about that?

15:58.350 --> 16:01.085
I mean, it's like
I got a lot of sneakers.

16:01.120 --> 16:04.154
Like, why can't I give
sneakers to other people,

16:04.190 --> 16:07.424
or why can't I help out my family?
Cause, like, we need the money.

16:07.459 --> 16:10.194
Toboni: <i>That has David and
his mother holding out hope</i>

16:10.229 --> 16:13.495
<i>that one day he'll be able
to profit off of basketball.</i>

16:13.531 --> 16:15.497
I had to just start
answering calls,

16:15.533 --> 16:19.168
because I'm not sure if
it's a bill collector,

16:19.204 --> 16:21.838
or a college recruiter.

16:21.873 --> 16:23.339
So I answered everybody's calls,

16:23.374 --> 16:26.242
and most of the time, it was somebody
calling, saying they wanted my son.

16:26.277 --> 16:28.844
With all this money
these colleges make...

16:28.879 --> 16:30.879
off these kids...

16:32.082 --> 16:33.882
they should get
a little something.

16:33.917 --> 16:35.884
Toboni: <i>But the man who
designed the system</i>

16:35.919 --> 16:38.486
<i>behind David's sneakers,
Sonny Vaccaro,</i>

16:38.521 --> 16:42.290
<i>never intended for the players
themselves to be left out.</i>

16:42.325 --> 16:45.293
You paved the way for
big brands like Nike

16:45.328 --> 16:47.795
to make money
off of amateur athletes.

16:47.830 --> 16:48.929
How did you do that?

16:48.965 --> 16:52.233
I was sort of an
out-of-the-box guy,

16:52.268 --> 16:54.268
and when I finally got to Nike,

16:54.303 --> 16:56.971
all I did was go
there with an idea.

16:57.006 --> 17:00.307
I said, "You guys want to get
involved in college basketball?"

17:00.342 --> 17:01.608
They said, "Yeah, well,
how do you do that?"

17:01.644 --> 17:07.012
And I said, "Pay the coaches money
for being consultants for Nike,

17:07.048 --> 17:10.316
"and we will give the shoes to
the schools that they represent.

17:10.351 --> 17:12.752
"They will put them on
the feet of the athletes...

17:13.888 --> 17:15.155
and you'll get exposure."

17:16.825 --> 17:19.125
<i>I didn't talk to AD's.</i>

17:19.161 --> 17:21.593
I didn't talk
to school presidents.

17:21.627 --> 17:23.595
I talked to Jerry Tarkanian,

17:23.630 --> 17:24.863
Jimmy Valvano,

17:24.898 --> 17:27.365
Eddie Sutton, John Thompson.

17:27.401 --> 17:29.734
I mean, I talked to the coaches,

17:29.770 --> 17:33.672
who at that time weren't making the
multi-million dollar contracts.

17:33.707 --> 17:35.674
They were working
for 30,000 or 40,000.

17:35.709 --> 17:40.644
By 1982, every college coach worth their
salt was getting paid by a shoe company.

17:40.680 --> 17:43.014
How did Nike profit
off of that model?

17:43.049 --> 17:46.117
First year, we had seven
or eight schools.

17:46.152 --> 17:48.219
Year two, we had close to 80.

17:48.254 --> 17:50.321
They profited off of it,

17:50.356 --> 17:53.590
because they... and what the
world would then see...

17:53.626 --> 17:57.160
are the athletes, or the
endorsers, sell the product.

17:57.196 --> 18:00.797
My thought was then,
is now, and has proven to be

18:00.833 --> 18:04.100
one of the greatest marketing
moves in the history of anything,

18:04.136 --> 18:07.270
By the time the world woke up,
we had everybody.

18:07.306 --> 18:10.940
The system I created...
was beautiful.

18:10.975 --> 18:14.243
The only thing that morphed
into the reality of it all is

18:14.278 --> 18:19.181
the athletes should have walked lockstep
with the universities and the coaches.

18:19.217 --> 18:21.650
Toboni: <i>It's not just that
they haven't walked lockstep.</i>

18:21.685 --> 18:25.187
<i>While players are still prohibited
from profiting in any way,</i>

18:25.223 --> 18:26.421
<i>their coache" salaries</i>

18:26.457 --> 18:28.189
<i>have skyrocketed.</i>

18:28.225 --> 18:32.626
<i>82 coaches across the country
make more than $2 million a year.</i>

18:32.662 --> 18:34.762
<i>The University of Michigan's
football coach</i>

18:34.797 --> 18:36.464
<i>makes $9 million a year,</i>

18:36.499 --> 18:38.699
<i>and at in-state rival
Michigan State,</i>

18:38.735 --> 18:40.801
<i>the head football
and basketball coaches</i>

18:40.837 --> 18:43.338
<i>each make more
than $4 million a year.</i>

18:43.373 --> 18:44.772
<i>Helping to fuel these salaries,</i>

18:44.807 --> 18:47.474
<i>the biggest conferences
have their own TV networks</i>

18:47.509 --> 18:49.709
<i>that reach tens
of millions of viewers</i>

18:49.745 --> 18:53.747
<i>on top of lucrative deals
with major TV networks.</i>

18:53.782 --> 18:57.550
<i>While filming Michigan State's
49-0 victory over Rutgers,</i>

18:57.586 --> 19:01.288
<i>we experienced firsthand the
business of college sports.</i>

19:01.323 --> 19:02.688
The Big Ten Network
told us yesterday

19:02.723 --> 19:05.892
that in order to use the footage
that we film in the stadium today,

19:05.927 --> 19:10.729
we have to license it for $129
a second, minimum 30 seconds,

19:10.765 --> 19:15.501
which means that me talking to you right
now is costing us at least $1,000.

19:15.536 --> 19:19.004
Toboni: <i>In total, we were
charged more than $3,000</i>

19:19.039 --> 19:21.539
<i>to show game footage
we shot ourselves</i>

19:21.574 --> 19:23.208
<i>of one of the most
lopsided games</i>

19:23.243 --> 19:25.810
<i>of the college football season.</i>

19:25.845 --> 19:27.578
<i>But even this blowout
could be indicative</i>

19:27.614 --> 19:30.481
<i>of the huge role money plays
in college sports today.</i>

19:30.517 --> 19:33.551
<i>Rutgers went 0 and 9 in
a new conference this season.</i>

19:33.586 --> 19:37.221
<i>Many believe they were only
placed there to generate revenue.</i>

19:37.256 --> 19:42.126
Competitive levels have been thrown out
completely, because it's all about

19:42.161 --> 19:47.097
what schools can make you the
most TV dollars as a conference.

19:47.133 --> 19:49.766
Toboni: <i>When Rutgers and
Maryland joined the conference.</i>

19:49.802 --> 19:52.069
<i>The Big Ten Network
expanded its regional reach,</i>

19:52.104 --> 19:55.704
<i>and its audience jumped
from 52 million to 60 million,</i>

19:55.740 --> 20:01.644
<i>and then The Big Ten made three major
TV deals valued at $2.64 billion.</i>

20:01.679 --> 20:04.080
<i>Michigan State's athletic
director, Mark Hollis,</i>

20:04.115 --> 20:06.715
<i>who made more
than $900,000 last year,</i>

20:06.751 --> 20:09.452
<i>talked to us about how these
deals influence conferences.</i>

20:09.487 --> 20:12.054
Rutgers, Maryland, joined
the Big Ten in 2014,

20:12.089 --> 20:18.560
and before that, there was no presence in
that TV market in New York, New Jersey.

20:18.595 --> 20:23.398
Of course that brought in eight million more
households which means more ad revenues,

20:23.434 --> 20:26.001
right, which makes those TV
deals much more lucrative.

20:26.036 --> 20:28.769
So, are those TV deals
in some ways dictating

20:28.804 --> 20:31.005
which teams are in
which conferences?

20:31.040 --> 20:34.908
I think the commissioners
that help guide those decisions,

20:34.944 --> 20:37.078
um, were doing so in a way

20:37.113 --> 20:40.147
to create the type
of resources that we can

20:40.183 --> 20:43.217
to keep the services for our
student athletes in a way

20:43.252 --> 20:46.987
that, um, are either at the
level we have or even greater.

20:47.022 --> 20:48.888
I think also what
people wonder, though,

20:48.923 --> 20:52.058
is then why can't players
then take advantage of that,

20:52.094 --> 20:56.196
why they can't be benefiting
or why they're limited

20:56.231 --> 20:58.731
in how they benefit
from these deals.

20:58.766 --> 21:00.700
I think players
are benefiting from it.

21:02.136 --> 21:04.669
<i>Student athletes
today are, you know,</i>

21:04.705 --> 21:07.439
<i>provided with the opportunity
to receive a lot of benefits</i>

21:07.475 --> 21:11.776
from apparel to travel
to medical, food.

21:11.812 --> 21:15.114
You give them every... every
opportunity that you can...

21:15.149 --> 21:17.916
academically, athletically and
socially... to be successful.

21:17.951 --> 21:21.419
But are they really getting the
opportunity to get an education?

21:21.454 --> 21:23.087
Can you guarantee a degree? No.

21:23.123 --> 21:25.789
Can you guarantee that they're
getting the right education? No.

21:25.825 --> 21:27.225
You can give them
the ingredients,

21:27.260 --> 21:29.394
and the opportunity for success.

21:29.429 --> 21:32.763
Toboni: <i> But many college athletes grow
frustrated with the NCAA's system,</i>

21:32.798 --> 21:36.166
<i>and see pursuing some kind of money
during their prime earning years</i>

21:36.201 --> 21:40.103
<i>as more beneficial
than finishing their education.</i>

21:42.207 --> 21:44.408
<i>Peyton Barber was a
running back for Auburn,</i>

21:44.443 --> 21:46.776
<i>one of the top football
schools in the country.</i>

21:46.811 --> 21:48.711
Announcer:
You see Barber, he elevates.

21:48.747 --> 21:50.713
I think that ball
makes it this time.

21:50.749 --> 21:52.381
You ever wonder,
you're like out on the field,

21:52.417 --> 21:55.317
and you see all the fans and the
jerseys and all the stuff being sold

21:55.353 --> 21:58.254
and do you ever wonder where
that money goes? All the time.

22:00.224 --> 22:01.857
We bring in the majority
of the money

22:01.892 --> 22:03.825
for our school,

22:03.861 --> 22:05.861
$80 million
to $100 million a year.

22:05.896 --> 22:07.463
Do you see it as a job?

22:07.498 --> 22:11.066
Oh, definitely, I mean, getting
up at 5:45 in the morning,

22:11.101 --> 22:12.333
<i>going to work out.</i>

22:12.369 --> 22:14.536
<i>You have practice,
you have meetings all day.</i>

22:14.571 --> 22:18.273
I mean, your day's not
really over until 8:00 or 9:00.

22:18.308 --> 22:21.909
Toboni: <i> After making the SEC honor
roll in his sophomore season,</i>

22:21.945 --> 22:25.012
<i>money issues led Peyton
to leave college football</i>

22:25.048 --> 22:27.481
<i>and take his chances
in the NFL draft.</i>

22:27.516 --> 22:30.717
I don't know if anybody really knows
my mom, she's homeless right now.

22:30.752 --> 22:33.120
So, it's kinda...
I'm doing it for her.

22:33.155 --> 22:37.424
At what point did you decide that you
were gonna declare for the draft?

22:37.460 --> 22:39.426
We've been having, like,
some family, you know,

22:39.462 --> 22:41.295
problems for a while.

22:41.330 --> 22:43.096
When you come home, and
it's like... including me,

22:43.131 --> 22:46.232
it's like five people sleeping
in one room sometimes.

22:46.267 --> 22:47.800
That's a hard thing to see.

22:47.835 --> 22:50.103
I just wanted to help my family
out and provide for 'em.

22:50.138 --> 22:55.007
Lori: I kinda like wanted to
cry when I heard him say that.

22:55.042 --> 22:57.276
I want Peyton to get
his education.

22:57.312 --> 22:59.512
Toboni: Do you think you would
have left college early

22:59.547 --> 23:03.148
if you had been, in some way,
compensated throughout college?

23:03.183 --> 23:05.683
No, honestly.

23:05.719 --> 23:07.051
What's today?

23:07.087 --> 23:11.356
Today will be the day that I'm
predicted to go in the draft,

23:11.391 --> 23:16.461
so...
we'll just have to see.

23:16.497 --> 23:19.263
Announcer 1: <i>The NFL draft
has finally arrived.</i>

23:19.298 --> 23:20.531
Announcer 2:
<i>With the first pick,</i>

23:20.566 --> 23:24.235
the Los Angeles Rams
select Jared Goff.

23:24.270 --> 23:26.437
Toboni: <i>Experts predicted
Peyton would be picked</i>

23:26.472 --> 23:28.705
<i>in the last
four rounds of the draft.</i>

23:28.741 --> 23:31.175
<i>So, on the third
and final day of the draft,</i>

23:31.210 --> 23:33.210
<i>Peyton and his friends
gathered at a driving range</i>

23:33.246 --> 23:36.579
<i>to celebrate his new
career in the NFL.</i>

23:36.615 --> 23:39.449
I love you, brother.
I love you too, man.

23:39.484 --> 23:42.885
How you been? I'm good, man.
I've been good.

23:42.920 --> 23:44.254
Just waiting?
Yeah.

23:44.289 --> 23:46.489
Peyton: Hopefully I get
a call sometime soon.

23:59.703 --> 24:02.037
Peyton: You know Travis Feeney?

24:02.072 --> 24:03.072
I know who he is.

24:03.106 --> 24:04.273
Peyton:
He got drafted.

24:05.242 --> 24:08.209
Got a Gainesville
number calling me.

24:08.244 --> 24:10.110
Who's that?
I don't know.

24:10.146 --> 24:12.880
Lisa: <i>Peyton? Peyton?</i>
Hello? Hey.

24:12.915 --> 24:15.550
Lisa: <i>Anything yet?</i> No, not yet.

24:17.153 --> 24:19.019
<i>How much longer are we
gonna have to wait?</i>

24:19.055 --> 24:22.456
I don't know.
Trying to... trying to see.

24:22.492 --> 24:23.791
<i>Oh.</i>

24:25.061 --> 24:27.160
Football is football.

24:29.097 --> 24:31.164
I'm fine.

24:36.605 --> 24:38.305
Each round,
each pick that goes by

24:38.340 --> 24:41.374
means less money for him
if he eventually gets picked.

24:41.410 --> 24:45.177
It's just kind of like the not knowing, the
uncertainty, that's the toughest part today.

24:45.213 --> 24:47.513
Alex Collins got picked up
by the Seahawks.

24:50.518 --> 24:52.218
Hello?

24:52.253 --> 24:53.686
Okay, hey, how are you doing?

24:54.922 --> 24:57.256
Doing pretty good.

24:57.291 --> 24:58.990
All right, well...
all right, bye.

25:00.460 --> 25:02.560
Lori:
What did they say?

25:02.596 --> 25:06.997
He just keeps on talking about, like, free...
free agency if I don't get picked up.

25:07.033 --> 25:08.633
Stuff like that.

25:08.668 --> 25:12.303
Toboni: <i> Undrafted players still have
an opportunity to sign pro contracts,</i>

25:12.339 --> 25:14.239
<i>but they have a slimmer
chance of making teams</i>

25:14.274 --> 25:16.406
<i>and receive far less money.</i>

25:32.524 --> 25:36.058
Peyton: This is kinda... this
is kind of embarrassing.

25:36.093 --> 25:38.594
This is why, one, I didn't want
to invite this many people.

25:38.630 --> 25:42.265
For Peyton, what's going on right now?
If this is an okay time?

25:42.300 --> 25:44.433
Ken Barber: We've had about 12
teams that have been calling,

25:44.469 --> 25:47.069
and they want him
automatically for a free agency.

25:47.104 --> 25:50.005
So what they're doing right
now is making some offers,

25:50.040 --> 25:51.373
of what they would
offer, basically,

25:51.408 --> 25:53.475
as far as for him signing
on as a free agent.

25:53.510 --> 25:56.144
And we have to make a decision
within the next couple of minutes.

25:56.179 --> 25:59.381
Do you wanna...
it's... it's Tampa.

25:59.416 --> 26:01.149
What do you... what do you say?
Sure.

26:01.184 --> 26:02.717
Huh?
Yeah.

26:04.187 --> 26:05.487
Done deal?

26:06.757 --> 26:08.722
Tampa.

26:18.901 --> 26:20.901
Toboni: <i>Peyton received
a small signing bonus,</i>

26:20.936 --> 26:22.670
<i>but wasn't offered a salary
to attend the NFL's</i>

26:22.705 --> 26:24.870
<i>Tampa Bay Buccaneers
training camp.</i>

26:24.906 --> 26:26.439
<i>He was initially cut
from the team,</i>

26:26.474 --> 26:28.240
<i>but then made it
to the active roster</i>

26:28.276 --> 26:30.576
<i>after a series
of running backs were injured.</i>

26:30.612 --> 26:31.877
Boy, the Bucs clicked.

26:31.913 --> 26:34.347
<i>Sports Announcer: And this
is your ballgame right here.</i>

26:34.382 --> 26:37.717
Peyton Barber.
His first NFL touchdown.

26:37.752 --> 26:39.118
A 44-yarder.

26:39.153 --> 26:41.820
Toboni: <i> Peyton has been able to stay
on the active roster all season,</i>

26:41.855 --> 26:44.989
<i>but there's little
security in the NFL.</i>

26:46.259 --> 26:48.493
The money... the money's
definitely been helping...

26:48.529 --> 26:50.429
been helping us out a lot...

26:50.464 --> 26:52.897
<i>but new guys coming in,
every day, you know,</i>

26:52.933 --> 26:55.534
<i>competing for the same
spot that you have.</i>

26:55.569 --> 26:58.203
<i>So, this could be here today,
it could be gone the next.</i>

26:58.238 --> 27:00.404
Average lifespan
of a running back is...

27:00.440 --> 27:02.239
two and a half years,
or something like that.

27:04.644 --> 27:06.477
Toboni:
<i>As revenues continue to grow,</i>

27:06.512 --> 27:10.381
<i>the pressure on the NCAA to resolve
this issue is only mounting.</i>

27:10.416 --> 27:13.584
<i>The Jenkins case is expected
to be in court within a year,</i>

27:13.619 --> 27:16.519
<i>and the result could
be the end of amateurism.</i>

27:18.423 --> 27:21.858
Hollis: We have some challenges that
we have to fix in college sports.

27:21.893 --> 27:25.528
I'd like to see student
athletes get something.

27:25.564 --> 27:29.198
It's getting the apartment, it's getting
the car, it's being able to live.

27:29.234 --> 27:32.101
Can we do better? Absolutely.

27:34.805 --> 27:38.006
Hocutt: Intercollegiate athletics
is the second-highest provider

27:38.041 --> 27:40.509
of college scholarship
behind the GI Bill.

27:40.544 --> 27:43.211
So, when you look at
the educational opportunities

27:43.247 --> 27:45.947
that are afforded
to young people today

27:45.983 --> 27:48.650
through participation in college
sports, it's significant.

27:51.588 --> 27:54.722
So, let's understand
the hypocrisy.

27:54.758 --> 27:59.093
There are no games
without the players.

27:59.128 --> 28:00.928
<i>They're selling them!</i>

28:00.963 --> 28:05.266
They're not giving you a $50,000
education or cost of living.

28:05.301 --> 28:07.200
They're giving you
a seat in the classroom.

28:07.235 --> 28:08.968
It's a goddamn chair.

28:09.004 --> 28:13.607
Toboni: <i>Thousands of student athletes
will enter the NCAA next year.</i>

28:13.642 --> 28:15.409
<i>David is one of them.</i>

28:17.145 --> 28:19.813
Basketball's not guaranteed.

28:19.848 --> 28:22.015
And I always tell him...

28:22.050 --> 28:24.444
take advantage
of these colleges,

28:24.564 --> 28:26.364
cause they're gonna take...
take advantage of you.
