02:43.885 --> 02:45.187
Hey, Coach!

02:45.220 --> 02:46.954
- Hey, Brent!
- Hey.

02:46.988 --> 02:50.025
Glad I was able to catch you
before the game.

02:50.058 --> 02:51.293
Do you have a sec?

02:51.326 --> 02:53.028
Actually, I was just about
to head inside.

02:53.061 --> 02:56.064
Oh.

02:56.098 --> 02:57.166
What's up, Brent?

02:57.199 --> 03:00.102
Oh, I just had a few ideas
I wanted to run past you

03:00.135 --> 03:02.271
- about the offense?
- Oh.

03:02.304 --> 03:04.173
- The offense.
- Yeah.

03:18.819 --> 03:22.090
Oh, fuck, come on.

03:22.124 --> 03:25.294
- Sorry.
- Oh, hey, no problem.

03:25.327 --> 03:27.329
- Bill, right?
- Yeah!

03:27.362 --> 03:29.964
- Ken.
- Yeah, we did...

03:29.997 --> 03:32.367
- Temple.
- Temple, that's right, yeah.

03:32.401 --> 03:34.936
- Good to see you again.
- Yeah, you too.

03:40.108 --> 03:43.145
Oh, fuck's sakes.

03:43.178 --> 03:45.247
- Sorry.
- It's all good.

03:45.280 --> 03:47.082
It's my wife.

03:52.987 --> 03:55.023
Oh, for fuck's sakes.

03:58.460 --> 04:00.095
Ringer's broken.

04:03.432 --> 04:04.899
Everything okay?

04:04.932 --> 04:07.236
Yeah.

04:07.269 --> 04:09.071
Just going through
a bit of a rough patch.

04:09.104 --> 04:10.339
Oh, shit.

04:10.372 --> 04:11.872
Sorry to hear that.

04:11.906 --> 04:14.276
Thanks.

04:14.309 --> 04:16.978
She's freaking out.

04:17.012 --> 04:20.915
She thinks our dog
has osteoporosis.

04:20.947 --> 04:22.284
Didn't even know
dogs could get that.

04:22.317 --> 04:24.319
Apparently.

04:24.353 --> 04:25.820
She read something
on the internet

04:25.853 --> 04:27.989
and now she thinks
our dog has it.

04:28.023 --> 04:30.292
Geez.

04:30.325 --> 04:32.227
Shih Tzus are very prone to it.

04:32.261 --> 04:33.961
Oh, that's what you have,
a Shih Tzu?

04:33.995 --> 04:35.896
Yeah.

04:35.930 --> 04:37.466
I wanted a Lab.

04:38.899 --> 04:40.269
I don't know if I told you,

04:40.302 --> 04:41.470
but I'm reading Sacred Hoops.

04:41.503 --> 04:42.537
Have you read Sacred Hoops?

04:42.571 --> 04:44.139
- No.
- Really?

04:44.172 --> 04:45.440
- You've never read Sacred Hoops?
- No, I haven't.

04:45.474 --> 04:47.509
Oh. I'm surprised.

04:47.542 --> 04:50.245
- What is Sacred Hoops, Brent?
- Oh, um...

04:53.582 --> 04:56.318
Sacred Hoops: Spiritual Lessons
of a Hardwood Warrior

04:56.351 --> 04:57.452
by Phil Jackson.

04:57.486 --> 04:59.021
It's a great read!

04:59.054 --> 05:02.257
It's got some insights
about Jordan, Pippen.

05:02.291 --> 05:04.293
Do you know he actually played
for Bill Fitch?

05:04.326 --> 05:05.993
Who? Scottie Pippen?

05:06.028 --> 05:07.329
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

05:07.362 --> 05:09.097
Phil Jackson.

05:09.131 --> 05:10.332
Yeah, I can't believe it.

05:10.365 --> 05:14.403
Two of the greatest coaches
of all time working together.

05:14.436 --> 05:15.604
- It's pretty wild.
- What did you want

05:15.637 --> 05:20.108
- to talk to me about, Brent?
- Oh, I just wanted to know,

05:20.142 --> 05:23.811
have you ever considered
running the triangle offense?

05:25.913 --> 05:28.383
You know,
I'm not familiar enough

05:28.417 --> 05:31.253
with the triangle offense
to say yay or nay.

05:31.286 --> 05:33.355
- Really?
- Yeah.

05:33.388 --> 05:35.324
Have you heard of
the triangle offense?

05:35.357 --> 05:37.426
Of course I've heard
of the triangle offense.

05:37.459 --> 05:39.461
'Cause I'd be surprised
if you didn't.

05:39.494 --> 05:42.197
- You're Coach.
- Yeah, I am Coach, Brent.

05:42.230 --> 05:44.633
Hey, sorry,
a little left-field here.

05:44.666 --> 05:45.966
Just a heads up,
I've gotta take off

05:46.001 --> 05:48.403
- right after the game.
- Yeah, sure.

05:48.437 --> 05:49.538
I have to leave right away.

05:49.571 --> 05:52.407
It's cool if you sign out
the score sheets for me?

05:52.441 --> 05:54.543
- Yeah, no problem.
- Awesome, thanks, man.

05:56.411 --> 05:58.580
What, you got a hot date?

05:58.613 --> 06:03.218
No, actually, it's just
this Toastmasters meeting.

06:03.251 --> 06:05.287
Oh.

06:05.320 --> 06:06.921
That's that public speaking
thing, huh?

06:06.954 --> 06:09.624
Yeah, yeah,
public speaking thing, yup.

06:13.261 --> 06:14.563
Oh, for fuck's sake.

06:14.596 --> 06:16.131
I'm just gonna turn this off.

06:16.164 --> 06:18.433
No, hey, don't worry.

06:18.467 --> 06:19.668
- You don't mind?
- No, take your call, man,

06:19.701 --> 06:21.370
it's good.

06:24.706 --> 06:26.208
Hey.

06:27.642 --> 06:29.111
What?

06:29.144 --> 06:33.148
So the whole premise is,
essentially,

06:33.181 --> 06:35.050
how can you know what's real?

06:35.083 --> 06:37.152
- Okay.
- Because it's like...

06:37.185 --> 06:39.321
like take right now,
for instance.

06:39.354 --> 06:41.623
I mean, this could be
a dream, right?

06:41.656 --> 06:43.458
- Well, why not?
- Okay, sure, yeah,

06:43.492 --> 06:45.394
it could be a dream.

06:45.427 --> 06:49.631
Okay, so the whole thing is,
basically,

06:49.664 --> 06:54.169
you can't know what is real
and what isn't, right?

06:54.202 --> 06:56.705
Because what actually
defines reality?

06:56.738 --> 06:58.373
Unhappy that I am,

06:58.407 --> 07:00.242
I cannot heave my heart
into my mouth.

07:00.275 --> 07:02.611
I love your majesty
according to my bond,

07:02.644 --> 07:04.979
no more, no less.

07:05.013 --> 07:07.082
How, how, Cordelia?

07:07.115 --> 07:08.250
Mend your speech a little,

07:08.283 --> 07:09.418
lest you may mark
your fortunes...

07:09.451 --> 07:11.620
Mar.

07:11.653 --> 07:12.987
What?

07:13.021 --> 07:16.091
"Lest you may mar
your fortunes."

07:16.124 --> 07:17.559
Um...

07:17.592 --> 07:20.429
Mine... mine says "mark."

07:21.630 --> 07:24.166
Weird.

07:24.199 --> 07:26.001
Do we have the same script?

07:32.040 --> 07:34.443
Weird.

07:34.476 --> 07:36.344
I was talking to my grandpa
about this,

07:36.378 --> 07:39.247
and he's really into
Eastern philosophy and whatnot,

07:39.281 --> 07:44.319
and he was telling me about
this Chinese philosopher guy

07:44.352 --> 07:47.088
who had this dream one night
that he was a butterfly.

07:47.122 --> 07:48.156
- Okay.
- And when he wakes up,

07:48.190 --> 07:52.461
he thinks, "How do I know
I'm not a butterfly

07:52.494 --> 07:53.595
dreaming I'm a human?"

07:53.628 --> 07:55.530
- You know?
- Uh, sure.

07:55.564 --> 07:58.333
The dream felt just as real
as being awake.

07:58.366 --> 08:00.168
Maybe it even was as real
as being awake.

08:00.202 --> 08:03.071
- I understand the concept.
- Okay.

08:03.104 --> 08:06.408
So, yeah, in answer
to your question,

08:06.441 --> 08:09.311
that's basically
what The Matrix is about.

08:09.344 --> 08:10.512
Shit.

08:12.247 --> 08:15.750
So, which version should we use?

08:15.784 --> 08:19.020
Well, I think
he's trying to tell her

08:19.054 --> 08:21.223
he doesn't want her
to hurt her fortunes,

08:21.256 --> 08:23.658
so "mar" would be appropriate.

08:23.692 --> 08:27.462
But "mark" could work too
like he's saying

08:27.496 --> 08:32.467
he doesn't want her
to put a mark on her fortunes.

08:32.501 --> 08:34.336
Is it still in iambic pen...

08:43.245 --> 08:45.213
They won't let us do it.

08:45.247 --> 08:46.448
What?

08:46.481 --> 08:48.216
They say it's too controversial.

08:48.250 --> 08:49.217
That's the point!

08:49.251 --> 08:51.086
And that's what I told them.

08:51.119 --> 08:53.455
We're supposed to go up
in less than a week!

08:53.488 --> 08:56.391
They also said it was offensive.

08:56.424 --> 08:58.059
It's not offensive!

08:58.093 --> 09:00.328
Provocative, yes,
but not offensive.

09:00.362 --> 09:02.097
I told them it was intended

09:02.130 --> 09:04.366
to push audiences
out of their comfort zone.

09:04.399 --> 09:06.701
This is so bourgeoisie.

09:10.872 --> 09:12.707
Maybe we could find
another venue.

09:12.741 --> 09:14.843
The whole point is to criticize

09:14.876 --> 09:16.845
the patriarchal bias
of the school system,

09:16.878 --> 09:19.648
plus Leif has already started
building the set.

09:19.681 --> 09:23.084
This is fucking censorship.

09:23.118 --> 09:25.754
We could take it to the press.

09:25.787 --> 09:27.522
I know the editor
of the school paper,

09:27.556 --> 09:31.226
- and we could pub...
- Eh.

09:31.259 --> 09:34.462
Okay, this is just a suggestion,

09:34.496 --> 09:39.868
but, well, what if we just
didn't hang the effigy

09:39.901 --> 09:42.604
of Jean ChrÃ©tien at the end?

09:46.374 --> 09:49.678
Said it was just a suggestion.

10:14.669 --> 10:17.639
I don't care if your sister
hurt her back.

10:17.672 --> 10:20.842
Of course I care.

10:20.875 --> 10:25.146
It doesn't change the fact
that I've got a game to ref.

10:25.180 --> 10:27.582
Karen, no.

10:27.616 --> 10:29.584
I can't get a replacement.

10:31.486 --> 10:33.288
The game starts in like...

10:35.457 --> 10:37.492
It revolves around
three people:

10:37.525 --> 10:40.328
your wing, your mid post,
and your corner shooter.

10:40.362 --> 10:41.496
It's all about spacing
and passing

10:41.529 --> 10:43.398
and reading the defense.

10:43.431 --> 10:45.867
I actually drew up
some of the basic maneuvers

10:45.900 --> 10:46.835
for the guys to understand.

10:46.868 --> 10:49.204
It... to be honest, Brent,
I think this might be

10:49.237 --> 10:51.573
a little bit complex
for our players.

10:51.606 --> 10:53.475
Oh, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no!

10:53.508 --> 10:55.410
That's the interesting thing
about the triangle!

10:55.443 --> 11:00.315
Once you know the principles,
it's actually very simple.

11:00.348 --> 11:01.583
Okay.

11:03.652 --> 11:04.619
As you can see here...

11:05.687 --> 11:08.757
Well, take her with you then.

11:08.790 --> 11:11.393
Your sister is not allergic.

11:16.431 --> 11:18.833
Okay, that was one time,

11:18.867 --> 11:23.371
and she was completely fine
after they gave her the shot.

11:23.405 --> 11:25.373
Here.

11:25.407 --> 11:26.908
Actually, sorry.

11:26.941 --> 11:29.844
Is there like a place I could
mount these on or something?

11:31.946 --> 11:33.381
Sorry, Coach, sorry!

11:35.750 --> 11:37.652
Leave her home then.

11:37.686 --> 11:40.588
Come on, we leave her at home
all the time.

11:42.724 --> 11:46.661
The dog does not have
osteoporosis, Karen.

11:46.695 --> 11:48.396
It's like an existential thing.

11:48.430 --> 11:50.865
- What's an existential thing?
- The Matrix.

11:50.899 --> 11:52.934
Is it good?
I heard it wasn't very good.

11:52.967 --> 11:54.469
Who said it wasn't good?

11:54.502 --> 11:56.005
I don't know,
that's just what I heard.

11:56.038 --> 11:57.972
Well, it's excellent.

11:58.007 --> 11:59.941
Why is it existential?

11:59.974 --> 12:00.909
So, you know how
at the beginning...

12:00.942 --> 12:02.777
Why can't you just enjoy it
as a movie?

12:02.811 --> 12:04.879
Why do you gotta
analyze it so much?

12:04.913 --> 12:06.581
I don't analyze it that much.

12:06.614 --> 12:07.916
Yes, you do.

12:07.949 --> 12:11.020
Well, you can analyze something
and enjoy it, Craig.

12:11.053 --> 12:14.823
I don't quite get
why The Matrix is existential.

12:16.991 --> 12:20.328
We could do some kind of
guerilla performance.

12:20.361 --> 12:22.664
It would just get shut down.

12:22.697 --> 12:23.865
But at least people would know

12:23.898 --> 12:26.668
our voices
are being suppressed?

12:26.701 --> 12:27.836
I don't know.

12:27.869 --> 12:31.372
Guerilla performance
is kind of passÃ©.

12:31.406 --> 12:33.341
What about a different play?

12:33.374 --> 12:34.776
One that still criticizes

12:34.809 --> 12:37.645
the implicit patriarchal slant
of the school system,

12:37.679 --> 12:39.781
but does it in a less,

12:39.814 --> 12:42.650
you know, provocative way?

12:42.684 --> 12:45.286
We could do My Fair Lady.

12:45.320 --> 12:46.755
- Claire.
- What?

12:46.788 --> 12:48.423
It's a great play!

12:48.456 --> 12:50.425
It's totally retrograde!

12:50.458 --> 12:52.961
Well, we could
put a twist on it.

12:52.994 --> 12:55.930
We could set it in modern times,
and Eliza could come

12:55.964 --> 12:58.767
from a housing project
or something.

12:58.800 --> 13:01.302
So, you know how,
at the very beginning,

13:01.336 --> 13:02.570
- Neo is...
- Is that like...

13:02.604 --> 13:03.671
what are we studying
for English?

13:03.705 --> 13:05.673
- The Stranger.
- Yeah.

13:05.707 --> 13:06.941
Is it like that?

13:06.975 --> 13:08.743
I don't know,
I haven't read The Stranger.

13:08.777 --> 13:10.578
- You haven't read The Stranger?
- No.

13:10.612 --> 13:12.514
- Really?
- I haven't.

13:12.547 --> 13:14.616
I'm in Donnelly's class,
we're not reading it.

13:14.649 --> 13:15.950
Well, just 'cause you're not
studying it in school

13:15.984 --> 13:17.786
doesn't mean
you can't read it, Joel.

13:17.819 --> 13:19.988
Well, I plan to read it
eventually,

13:20.022 --> 13:21.990
I just don't have time
right now.

13:22.024 --> 13:22.924
Well, I think
you should make time,

13:22.957 --> 13:24.993
it's a classic.

13:25.027 --> 13:31.699
Can somebody please tell me
why The Matrix is existential?

13:31.733 --> 13:33.968
What if, instead of doing
some kind of play,

13:34.003 --> 13:36.471
we did like, I don't know,

13:36.504 --> 13:38.673
a protest maybe?

13:43.578 --> 13:47.415
I guess that's not
a terrible idea.

13:47.448 --> 13:48.850
Really?

14:08.170 --> 14:10.405
I heard that this team
is undefeated.

14:10.438 --> 14:12.074
- They're a good team.
- For three years.

14:12.107 --> 14:13.741
They've been undefeated
for three years?

14:13.775 --> 14:16.045
Yeah, apparently,
they beat their opponents

14:16.078 --> 14:17.745
by an average of 26 points.

14:17.779 --> 14:19.948
Let's focus on what
we need to do, okay, guys?

14:19.981 --> 14:21.150
I heard they have some guy

14:21.183 --> 14:22.750
who has a scholarship
to the States.

14:22.784 --> 14:23.985
Is that that Arthur guy?

14:24.019 --> 14:25.653
I don't know,
some big guy that can dunk.

14:25.687 --> 14:27.156
They have a big guy
that can dunk?

14:27.189 --> 14:30.458
I heard they have two big guys
that can dunk.

14:31.993 --> 14:34.096
Quiet!

14:34.129 --> 14:36.564
So, I just want
to go over a few things

14:36.598 --> 14:39.667
before we get going,
get out there, okay?

14:39.701 --> 14:40.735
Yes, Brent?

14:40.768 --> 14:42.937
I just thought maybe
we could talk to them about,

14:42.971 --> 14:45.573
- you know.
- No, I don't know.

14:45.607 --> 14:47.775
You know, the triangle offense.

14:47.809 --> 14:49.577
We're gonna run
a triangle offense?

14:49.611 --> 14:51.046
- No.
- What's a triangle offense?

14:51.080 --> 14:52.147
- It's what the Lakers use.
- We're not running

14:52.181 --> 14:54.983
- a triangle offense.
- Yeah, the Bulls use it, too.

14:55.017 --> 14:56.718
- Really?
- Yeah, with Jordan.

14:56.751 --> 14:59.121
It's actually a very effective
offensive system.

14:59.154 --> 15:00.189
I want to run
the triangle offense.

15:00.222 --> 15:01.923
We're not running
the triangle offense, guys!

15:01.956 --> 15:04.059
I'm just curious,
but how does it work?

15:04.093 --> 15:05.094
It seems really complicated.

15:05.127 --> 15:07.595
No, not at all,
it's actually very simple.

15:07.629 --> 15:10.865
- In this book I'm reading...
- Brent.

15:10.899 --> 15:12.500
Sorry.

15:18.473 --> 15:19.841
Thank you.

15:19.874 --> 15:23.112
Okay, so,
this is what we're gonna do.

15:24.846 --> 15:28.217
We could bring in a chicken
and strangle it,

15:28.250 --> 15:30.019
to symbolize our voices
being strangled

15:30.052 --> 15:30.885
by the administration.

15:30.919 --> 15:33.755
Um, I would really like
to do something

15:33.788 --> 15:38.526
that doesn't, you know,
involve hurting animals.

15:38.559 --> 15:40.862
It could be a rubber chicken.

15:40.895 --> 15:42.231
What about a sit-in?

15:42.264 --> 15:43.798
My mom did one in the '60s

15:43.831 --> 15:47.002
so female students
could wear jeans to school.

15:47.036 --> 15:49.871
It needs to be something
more immediate.

15:49.904 --> 15:52.007
You know,
something confrontational.

15:52.041 --> 15:55.476
Sit-ins can be
quite confrontational.

15:55.510 --> 15:58.646
What about a bunch of dogs
wearing muzzles

15:58.680 --> 16:00.615
to symbolize our voices
being muzzled

16:00.648 --> 16:02.617
- by the administration?
- I think it's best

16:02.650 --> 16:06.521
if we don't involve animals,
okay?

16:06.554 --> 16:09.590
We could block the entrance
to the school

16:09.624 --> 16:11.893
and sing a protest song,

16:11.926 --> 16:14.963
like, We Shall Overcome,
or something.

16:14.996 --> 16:19.101
No, we need something urgent.

16:19.134 --> 16:21.736
Something...

16:24.539 --> 16:27.009
We could dump a bucket of blood
on the basketball court.

16:30.279 --> 16:31.846
What?

16:35.850 --> 16:37.852
Jesus!

16:37.885 --> 16:39.821
They're huge.

16:39.854 --> 16:42.724
Fuck, that guy just dunked.

16:42.757 --> 16:44.892
So did that guy.

16:44.926 --> 16:46.561
And that guy.

16:48.197 --> 16:49.964
Fuck.

16:49.998 --> 16:51.899
Man, they're huge.

16:55.870 --> 16:58.639
- Hey, man.
- Hey.

16:58.673 --> 16:59.841
How you doing?

16:59.874 --> 17:03.178
- Oh, good.
- Good.

17:03.212 --> 17:04.779
Hey, sorry about earlier.

17:04.811 --> 17:06.781
It's all good, no worries.

17:08.849 --> 17:10.585
Just a quick heads up...

17:12.686 --> 17:14.989
I may have to miss
the opening tip.

17:15.023 --> 17:16.325
- Oh?
- Yeah,

17:16.358 --> 17:19.727
my wife's gotta come by,
drop something off.

17:19.761 --> 17:21.996
She can't, uh...

17:22.031 --> 17:24.766
she can't just bring it here?

17:24.799 --> 17:26.300
Well, no.

17:28.170 --> 17:31.073
It's our dog.

17:31.106 --> 17:32.774
Are you even
allowed to have pets in here?

17:32.807 --> 17:35.210
Well, it's fine.

17:39.014 --> 17:41.050
Can you guys
join the lay-up line?

17:41.083 --> 17:42.717
- We need more people.
- Uh, yeah!

17:42.750 --> 17:44.253
Yeah, sorry.

17:46.055 --> 17:47.889
Holy shit.

17:47.922 --> 17:50.359
Did that guy just do a 360?

17:52.294 --> 17:54.229
Fuck.

17:55.897 --> 17:57.332
I just mean, like, technically,

17:57.366 --> 18:00.835
there needs to be two of us
to ref the game.

18:00.868 --> 18:02.737
Right, yeah, okay.

18:02.770 --> 18:05.240
Well, uh...

18:05.274 --> 18:07.842
Maybe we could just
delay it a little.

18:07.875 --> 18:10.845
Well, no, 'cause I got
that thing later that I...

18:10.878 --> 18:13.282
- Sorry, I gotta go.
- Toastmasters meeting.

18:13.315 --> 18:15.817
Yeah, that Toastmasters thing.

18:15.850 --> 18:18.387
- Yeah, my thing.
- I'll be back.

18:18.420 --> 18:19.987
You'll be back.

18:57.959 --> 19:00.095
We're really considering this?

19:00.129 --> 19:04.732
Pouring blood
onto the basketball court?

19:04.765 --> 19:07.369
Well, we wanna make
a statement, don't we?

19:07.402 --> 19:09.770
There is a game
going on right now.

19:09.804 --> 19:11.173
It does make sense.

19:11.206 --> 19:12.940
What's more emblematic
of the patriarchy

19:12.974 --> 19:14.276
than organized sport?

19:14.309 --> 19:17.279
I just worry
it's a bit extreme.

19:17.312 --> 19:19.314
That's the point, Claire.

19:19.348 --> 19:23.152
I think a sit-in
would be effective.

19:23.185 --> 19:26.221
The hard part, though,
would be getting the blood.

19:26.255 --> 19:28.023
We could make fake blood.

19:28.056 --> 19:31.326
What about
making some posters, okay?

19:31.360 --> 19:36.231
We could do them in like
a cool, faux-propaganda style.

19:36.265 --> 19:38.033
My cousin works at Kinko's.

19:38.066 --> 19:39.168
She'd probably give us a deal.

19:39.201 --> 19:41.069
I think we need real blood.

19:41.103 --> 19:43.105
Fake blood never looks right.

19:45.174 --> 19:50.445
Can I just say,
blood is very unhygienic.

19:52.347 --> 19:55.917
Guys, I really don't think
this is a good idea.

19:55.950 --> 20:01.089
Yeah, maybe the blood thing
is a tad much.

20:01.123 --> 20:04.426
What if, instead,
we got a bunch of rats

20:04.459 --> 20:06.495
and released them
into the gymnasium and...

20:06.528 --> 20:09.897
Could we go to a hospital
and ask for blood?

20:12.034 --> 20:14.069
I can get us blood.

20:15.537 --> 20:18.307
Like how?

20:18.340 --> 20:21.109
Well, my brother is,
like, a Satanist.

20:21.143 --> 20:22.810
Oh, my goodness.

20:24.979 --> 20:26.847
All right,
remember what we talked about.

20:26.881 --> 20:29.750
Move your feet, communicate,
make good passes...

20:29.784 --> 20:31.320
Everyone on their team can dunk.

20:31.353 --> 20:32.454
Pardon me?

20:32.487 --> 20:35.123
Everyone on their team can dunk.

20:35.157 --> 20:37.825
That's not really relevant
right now, Joel.

20:37.858 --> 20:39.494
- It's terrifying.
- Don't worry about them.

20:39.528 --> 20:41.762
Worry about your own game,
and you'll be fine.

20:41.796 --> 20:43.031
But I don't want
to get dunked on.

20:43.065 --> 20:44.099
You're not gonna
get dunked on, Fred.

20:44.132 --> 20:45.367
Coach, I don't want
to get dunked on, either.

20:45.400 --> 20:46.501
- Me neither.
- I'd also prefer

20:46.535 --> 20:48.370
not to get dunked on.

20:48.403 --> 20:50.771
No one is getting dunked on,
okay?

20:50.805 --> 20:51.806
Look, they're a good team,

20:51.839 --> 20:53.275
but that doesn't mean
they can't be beat.

20:53.308 --> 20:56.245
- But they haven't been beat.
- Yet.

20:56.278 --> 20:58.046
- Three years.
- Look, Joel,

20:58.080 --> 20:59.014
could you just try...

20:59.047 --> 21:01.416
- You know, Phil Jackson...
- Not now, Brent.

21:01.450 --> 21:02.817
Sorry.

21:02.850 --> 21:05.254
All right, defense on three.

21:06.921 --> 21:09.458
One, two, three, defense!

21:09.491 --> 21:10.825
Woo-hoo!

21:10.858 --> 21:12.294
You got it, guys!

21:14.563 --> 21:16.064
What is it, Fred?

21:16.098 --> 21:18.400
You promise
I won't get dunked on?

21:18.433 --> 21:19.468
Go.

21:22.404 --> 21:23.871
So, he is living

21:23.904 --> 21:27.209
in what he considers reality,
right?

21:27.242 --> 21:30.479
But he realizes that
that's not reality, so...

21:50.399 --> 21:51.400
Yeah, so, I don't know.

21:51.433 --> 21:53.168
I guess she was just
stepping out of the shower

21:53.201 --> 21:54.136
and her back went.

21:54.169 --> 21:56.271
- Poor thing, I just...
- Poor thing, right.

21:56.305 --> 21:58.607
Some people just can't
catch a break, you know?

21:58.640 --> 22:00.609
Well, anyway, here.

22:00.642 --> 22:02.511
It's okay, Princess...
here, here.

22:02.544 --> 22:06.048
And look out,
watch out for the latch.

22:06.081 --> 22:06.881
I know.

22:06.914 --> 22:08.250
I mean, you really need
to make sure...

22:08.283 --> 22:11.586
- I know, okay?
- Um, okay, and these.

22:13.188 --> 22:17.225
- What's this?
- She needs to go for a walk.

22:17.259 --> 22:19.561
I don't have time to take her
for a walk, Karen.

22:19.594 --> 22:20.961
Well, she hasn't been out
all day, Ken.

22:20.995 --> 22:22.431
How is that my fault?

22:22.464 --> 22:23.864
I was working, Ken.

22:23.898 --> 22:25.100
Oh.

22:25.133 --> 22:26.601
- What?
- Nothing.

22:26.635 --> 22:29.171
- You asshole!
- What?

22:29.204 --> 22:33.442
- Making art is work, Ken.
- Right, yeah.

22:33.475 --> 22:36.611
Making clay pigs all day,
that's real back-breaking work.

22:43.452 --> 22:44.586
Mitch!

22:47.988 --> 22:49.191
Where you going?

22:49.224 --> 22:51.059
Oh!

22:51.093 --> 22:53.495
My God, look at these guys.

22:53.528 --> 22:55.263
That one has a tattoo
on its face.

22:55.297 --> 22:57.332
They're even better
than they looked in warm-ups.

22:57.366 --> 22:58.933
Oh, Jesus.

22:58.966 --> 23:01.269
Did that guy just put the ball
through Craig's legs?

23:01.303 --> 23:02.204
Is he gonna...

23:08.043 --> 23:10.445
Close the latch.

23:10.479 --> 23:12.647
The latch is closed,
I know to close it.

23:12.681 --> 23:14.882
Jesus, come on.

23:17.219 --> 23:18.453
Hey, Coach.

23:18.487 --> 23:20.122
I don't wanna push it
because I understand

23:20.155 --> 23:23.492
we have our own offense,
but I'm watching these guys.

23:23.525 --> 23:24.959
I think the triangle offense

23:24.992 --> 23:26.595
would be really effective
against them.

23:26.628 --> 23:28.130
- Hmm.
- Now don't get me wrong,

23:28.163 --> 23:30.298
they're good,
but that's kind of the beauty

23:30.332 --> 23:31.333
of the triangle, you know?

23:31.366 --> 23:33.034
It turns
the opponents' strengths

23:33.068 --> 23:34.603
- into weaknesses.
- Uh-huh.

23:34.636 --> 23:36.571
So, here's what I'm thinking,
okay?

23:36.605 --> 23:38.607
We start the game out,
we run our old sets.

23:38.640 --> 23:40.075
let them get comfortable,

23:40.108 --> 23:42.043
it's kind of like
a distraction tactic,

23:42.077 --> 23:43.712
and then a few minutes in,
we switch it up,

23:43.745 --> 23:47.082
- go full triangle.
- Mm.

23:47.115 --> 23:48.717
- What do you think?
- Mm.

23:48.750 --> 23:50.985
Coach?

23:51.019 --> 23:53.954
- What do you think?
- Mhm.

23:53.988 --> 23:56.991
I need to use the blood
from your music video.

23:57.025 --> 24:00.028
Yeah, yes.

24:00.061 --> 24:02.664
None of your business
what it's for!

24:02.697 --> 24:05.233
And I need you to bring it here.

24:05.267 --> 24:08.470
My school, dumbass.

24:08.503 --> 24:12.240
I don't care if you're playing
video games, Brandon.

24:12.274 --> 24:13.675
If you don't do it,
I'm telling Mom

24:13.708 --> 24:17.045
that you and Kat had sex
in the hot tub!

24:27.055 --> 24:28.390
He's so annoying.

24:28.423 --> 24:29.624
He's like, "I can't come

24:29.658 --> 24:32.127
'cause I'm busy
playing Donkey Kong."

24:33.662 --> 24:36.665
So, um, he's not coming?

24:36.698 --> 24:39.601
Oh, he'll be here
in like 10 minutes.

24:39.634 --> 24:42.003
So, you know how
at the beginning of The Matrix,

24:42.037 --> 24:44.339
Neo is in
this whole other world?

24:44.372 --> 24:46.074
Yeah, he's like
a computer hacker...

24:46.107 --> 24:48.109
Right, and then he meets
Trinity and Morpheus,

24:48.143 --> 24:49.778
and they tell him that
the world he's living in

24:49.811 --> 24:50.712
is not the real world.

24:50.745 --> 24:52.314
- Yeah.
- Right.

24:52.347 --> 24:53.281
And then he takes
the blue pill...

24:53.315 --> 24:55.116
- Uh, red pill.
- Okay, right.

24:55.150 --> 24:56.251
He takes the red pill,

24:56.284 --> 24:58.253
and his whole perspective
on life is just shattered,

24:58.286 --> 24:59.321
he doesn't know what's going on.

24:59.354 --> 25:02.224
Yeah, um, I'm sorry,
but I don't really see

25:02.257 --> 25:04.125
what that has to do
with, like, existentialism,

25:04.159 --> 25:07.362
- you know?
- Right, okay, um...

25:10.265 --> 25:12.734
My grandfather is really into
Eastern philosophy.

25:16.137 --> 25:18.273
All right.

25:18.306 --> 25:19.708
Now, Princess.

25:19.741 --> 25:22.511
Hey, you be
a good girl now, okay?

25:24.312 --> 25:25.647
Princess!

25:26.748 --> 25:28.149
Stop it!

25:28.183 --> 25:29.351
Hey!

25:33.321 --> 25:34.356
Here.

25:37.425 --> 25:39.294
All right?

25:39.327 --> 25:42.397
Now you be quiet now, okay?

25:43.798 --> 25:45.634
Good.

25:55.110 --> 25:59.681
So this Chinese philosopher was

25:59.714 --> 26:01.483
actually a butterfly?

26:01.516 --> 26:03.251
Well... well, that's the thing.

26:03.285 --> 26:04.553
He didn't know.

26:04.586 --> 26:06.354
We can't know.

26:06.388 --> 26:07.422
You know?

26:07.455 --> 26:09.524
But like, you know, it's like...

26:09.558 --> 26:12.460
It's like... like take right now,
for instance.

26:12.494 --> 26:14.429
This could be a dream.

26:14.462 --> 26:17.866
- It... why?
- Well, why not, you know?

26:17.899 --> 26:20.802
You ever go to bed
and have a very, very real dream

26:20.835 --> 26:23.572
- and then wake up?
- I guess some, but like...

26:23.605 --> 26:24.606
You know, it's not like
there's someone

26:24.639 --> 26:26.141
who welcomes you
back to reality

26:26.174 --> 26:27.542
and tells you
this is where it is.

26:27.576 --> 26:29.210
Yeah, I mean...

26:29.244 --> 26:31.446
So what proof do you have?

26:31.479 --> 26:33.381
Like I...

26:33.415 --> 26:35.750
I guess you could be right,
but like...

26:39.754 --> 26:41.590
Hm.

26:41.623 --> 26:45.894
So, should we just, like,
run in and throw it?

26:45.927 --> 26:47.629
Um...

26:49.464 --> 26:52.567
I think, like, um...

26:52.601 --> 26:56.271
Maybe we should write
a manifesto or something?

26:56.304 --> 26:59.407
Otherwise people
might miss the point.

27:00.875 --> 27:03.211
Wesley, can you write this down?

27:03.244 --> 27:05.580
Um, yeah?

27:05.614 --> 27:08.683
"To whom it may concern."

27:10.251 --> 27:12.287
Oh, my goodness.

27:13.488 --> 27:15.223
Come on, guys, this is easy.

27:18.493 --> 27:19.661
So it's been a bit
of a rough start.

27:19.694 --> 27:21.329
- I got dunked on twice!
- Well...

27:21.363 --> 27:23.431
Well, you said
I wouldn't get dunked on,

27:23.465 --> 27:24.165
you promised!

27:24.199 --> 27:24.899
I shouldn't have promised that.

27:24.933 --> 27:25.934
And we're down by 26 points.

27:25.967 --> 27:28.436
- Twenty-seven.
- The score's a bit lopsided.

27:28.470 --> 27:29.604
We've only scored three points.

27:29.638 --> 27:30.472
It's a massacre.

27:30.505 --> 27:32.307
Let's not use
that term yet, okay?

27:32.340 --> 27:35.276
And there's still
10 minutes left in the half.

27:35.310 --> 27:37.278
Yeah, so, lots of time
to get back in it.

27:37.312 --> 27:38.546
Lots of time for it
to get even worse!

27:38.580 --> 27:40.548
- We need to stay positive, guys.
- I got dunked on.

27:40.582 --> 27:42.350
Yeah, we know, Fred.

27:42.384 --> 27:43.918
Look, we can still come back.

27:43.952 --> 27:45.654
Crazier things have happened.

27:45.687 --> 27:47.856
- Like what?
- Joel, go in for Craig.

27:47.889 --> 27:49.357
I don't want to go in.

27:49.391 --> 27:50.492
I might get dunked on.

27:50.525 --> 27:52.861
No one is getting...

27:52.894 --> 27:55.263
Okay, there is a possibility

27:55.296 --> 27:56.865
that some of you
might get dunked on,

27:56.898 --> 27:58.266
but that's just...

27:58.299 --> 27:59.567
that's just basketball, I guess.

27:59.601 --> 28:01.836
This is high school basketball
in Calgary.

28:01.870 --> 28:04.305
I never expected
to get dunked on.

28:04.339 --> 28:06.474
Defense on three.

28:06.508 --> 28:08.743
One, two, three, defense!

28:11.579 --> 28:13.848
With this bloodshed...

28:13.882 --> 28:14.916
Through this bloodshed?

28:14.949 --> 28:16.918
With this...
with this bloodshed,

28:16.951 --> 28:20.221
we seek to...

28:20.255 --> 28:21.723
Tessa, just...

28:21.756 --> 28:23.892
- Oh, yeah, sorry.
- Not now.

28:23.925 --> 28:26.294
Uh, where was I?

28:26.327 --> 28:27.996
Through this bloodshed...

28:29.798 --> 28:31.399
- Tessa.
- Sorry.

28:35.370 --> 28:37.405
- Hey, man.
- Hey.

28:37.439 --> 28:39.874
- Sorry about that.
- All good.

28:39.908 --> 28:41.776
I got a little tiff
with the wife.

28:41.810 --> 28:45.947
- Mhm.
- She's so sensitive, you know?

28:45.980 --> 28:47.982
She has this craft store.

28:48.017 --> 28:50.952
She makes these little,
like little...

28:50.985 --> 28:52.353
- That's great.
- ...figurines,

28:52.387 --> 28:54.023
animal figurines, you know?

28:54.056 --> 28:55.924
I mean, they're pigs, mostly.

28:55.957 --> 28:58.460
We seek to draw attention

28:58.493 --> 29:01.763
to the artistic genocide...

29:01.796 --> 29:05.433
- is genocide too strong a term?
- I can't do this.

29:05.467 --> 29:07.268
What?

29:11.706 --> 29:15.744
I'm sorry, but I don't see
what pouring a bunch of blood

29:15.777 --> 29:18.880
on a basketball court
has to do with Shakespeare.

29:18.913 --> 29:22.317
That's what I thought
we were doing here.

29:22.350 --> 29:25.286
I only went along with
the Jean ChrÃ©tien effigy thing

29:25.320 --> 29:29.791
because, well, I guess
I'm not always strong enough

29:29.824 --> 29:32.293
to speak my mind.

29:32.327 --> 29:34.362
Because I still don't understand

29:34.395 --> 29:36.898
what hanging an effigy
of Jean ChrÃ©tien

29:36.931 --> 29:38.500
at the end of King Lear

29:38.533 --> 29:41.336
really has to do
with the public school system,

29:41.369 --> 29:44.506
or, for that matter,
the patriarchy...

29:44.539 --> 29:46.307
She is obsessed about pigs.

29:46.341 --> 29:47.509
Everything's pigs!

29:47.542 --> 29:49.577
Okay, white ball on back line.

29:50.745 --> 29:52.480
White ball on back line!

29:52.514 --> 29:55.316
White ball on back line,
I guess.

29:55.350 --> 29:57.452
And another thing.

29:57.485 --> 29:59.754
It feels like this group
is no longer being run

29:59.788 --> 30:00.922
like a collective.

30:00.955 --> 30:04.359
It feels like decisions
are being made unilaterally

30:04.392 --> 30:07.062
and I kind of thought
that the whole point

30:07.096 --> 30:10.065
of radical theatre was
to empower all participants,

30:10.099 --> 30:13.035
and work as an engaged
community of artisans,

30:13.068 --> 30:16.971
rather than as a hierarchy,
and...

30:17.006 --> 30:19.340
um, yeah.

30:19.374 --> 30:21.110
That's...

30:21.143 --> 30:23.978
that's all that I have to say.

30:26.414 --> 30:29.884
So, should I tell my brother
not to bring blood?

30:54.475 --> 30:56.544
So, you know, how...

30:56.578 --> 30:57.779
when the philosopher guy
woke up,

30:57.812 --> 31:00.548
how did he know
he wasn't a butterfly

31:00.582 --> 31:02.051
or how do you know
he wasn't a human, you know?

31:02.084 --> 31:04.686
Like he could have been either.

31:04.719 --> 31:06.121
Okay.

31:06.155 --> 31:08.957
So what does this have to do
with The Matrix?

31:08.990 --> 31:11.459
Well, you know, it's like
the differing realities

31:11.492 --> 31:13.394
and like, we don't know
which is which.

31:13.428 --> 31:15.064
You know, that kind of idea,
that whole, big...

31:15.097 --> 31:18.133
Hey, you guys talking
about The Matrix?

31:18.167 --> 31:20.702
- Kind of.
- Oh, awesome movie.

31:20.735 --> 31:22.004
Those martial arts scenes?

31:22.037 --> 31:24.039
- I loved it!
- Cool.

31:24.073 --> 31:25.840
Hey, you know in this book
I'm reading,

31:25.874 --> 31:29.078
Phil Jackson actually describes
the triangle offense

31:29.111 --> 31:31.013
as five-man Tai Chi.

31:33.615 --> 31:38.653
I thought it was cool, you know,
the martial arts connection.

31:38.686 --> 31:39.921
So anyway, right?

31:39.954 --> 31:42.690
This philosopher, you know,
he wasn't sure if he was like

31:42.724 --> 31:44.859
a butterfly or a human,

31:44.893 --> 31:47.462
so he was wondering,
like, why can't I...

31:47.495 --> 31:48.763
I could be both, you know?

31:48.796 --> 31:50.732
Claire, you always do this!

31:50.765 --> 31:53.635
Well, this is serious!

31:53.668 --> 31:56.804
It's in our mandate
that we have to push boundaries.

31:56.838 --> 31:58.940
Oh, who says we have
to push boundaries?

31:58.973 --> 32:01.010
We don't have to,
you just choose to,

32:01.043 --> 32:02.644
and you push them
a little too far.

32:02.677 --> 32:05.214
Look, as founder,
I feel it's the right decision.

32:05.247 --> 32:07.649
Well, I'm a co-founder, Danica!

32:07.682 --> 32:09.784
And current treasurer.

32:12.587 --> 32:15.924
I don't know what to tell ya.

32:15.957 --> 32:17.959
Fine.

32:17.992 --> 32:19.094
I just want to say that

32:19.128 --> 32:22.197
I'm not happy with the direction
our company is taking,

32:22.231 --> 32:24.933
and I will have
some very strong things to say

32:24.966 --> 32:27.102
at our next board meeting.

32:35.177 --> 32:36.744
If anyone wants to join me,

32:36.778 --> 32:40.249
I will be conducting
a peaceful sit-in

32:40.282 --> 32:42.784
in front of the main office.

33:25.593 --> 33:28.197
Alas, poor Yorick.

33:28.230 --> 33:31.233
I knew him, Horatio.

33:31.266 --> 33:37.939
A fellow of infinite jest,
of most excellent fancy.

33:37.972 --> 33:40.608
He hath borne me on his back
a thousand times

33:40.641 --> 33:47.016
and now, how abhorred
in my imagination is it?

33:47.049 --> 33:49.717
My gorge rises at it.

34:01.796 --> 34:02.830
You don't happen
to know the score

34:02.864 --> 34:05.300
in the hockey game do you?

34:05.334 --> 34:07.802
I put a couple bucks on it,
so I'm just curious.

34:07.835 --> 34:08.969
You, uh...

34:09.004 --> 34:11.139
you gamble much?

34:11.172 --> 34:13.775
I like to go to the casino.

34:13.808 --> 34:15.310
I mean, it's not a big deal.

34:15.344 --> 34:17.045
- Yeah.
- Right?

34:17.079 --> 34:18.646
Like, everyone goes
to the casino.

34:18.679 --> 34:20.715
She's like, you can't...

34:20.748 --> 34:22.251
You should be
at Gambler's Anonymous.

34:22.284 --> 34:25.786
Well, I'm not going
to Gambler's Anonymous,

34:25.820 --> 34:28.688
especially for, like,
a couple Sports Selects.

34:32.827 --> 34:34.695
Fuck.

34:34.728 --> 34:35.797
Uh...

34:36.764 --> 34:39.600
Mhm.

34:39.634 --> 34:41.601
Yeah, so, all right.

34:41.636 --> 34:43.371
They're a good team,
a really good team.

34:43.405 --> 34:45.672
But you guys are trying hard,
hanging in there.

34:45.706 --> 34:47.309
We're losing
by almost 50 points.

34:47.342 --> 34:50.812
- We are losing by 50 points.
- Fifty-two, actually.

34:50.844 --> 34:52.246
Forget about the score
right now, okay?

34:52.281 --> 34:54.083
Look, just keep playing hard.

34:54.116 --> 34:55.117
You never know what can happen.

34:55.150 --> 34:57.685
I have seen a lot of games
change dramatically.

35:00.289 --> 35:02.790
Um, Coach, if I may?

35:02.824 --> 35:03.825
What is it, Brent?

35:03.858 --> 35:06.794
I just want to share
a few words with the team.

35:06.828 --> 35:08.063
Is it about
the triangle offense?

35:08.097 --> 35:09.697
Um, not exactly.

35:09.730 --> 35:11.166
Is it about Phil Jackson?

35:11.200 --> 35:13.168
- Um...
- Be brief.

35:13.202 --> 35:16.004
Yeah, of course, thank you!

35:16.038 --> 35:18.240
Who here is familiar
with Sacred Hoops:

35:18.273 --> 35:21.009
Spiritual Lessons
of a Hardwood Warrior?

35:22.377 --> 35:23.878
By Phil Jackson?

35:25.314 --> 35:28.649
Phil Jackson,
coach of Los Angeles Lakers?

35:28.683 --> 35:32.154
Former coach
of the Chicago Bulls?

35:32.187 --> 35:34.389
- No one?
- We know who he is!

35:34.423 --> 35:36.958
We just haven't read the book.

35:36.991 --> 35:38.160
Wow!

35:38.193 --> 35:39.994
I'm surprised.

35:40.028 --> 35:43.065
I thought you guys were,
like, ballers.

35:43.098 --> 35:44.732
Well, point is that

35:44.765 --> 35:46.301
it's actually
a really great read.

35:46.335 --> 35:49.704
It's got some great stories
about Pippen and Jordan

35:49.737 --> 35:53.075
and the other guys that played
on the Chicago Bulls.

35:53.108 --> 35:55.110
Let's get to the point, Brent.

35:55.144 --> 35:57.146
I just wanted to share
a quote with you.

35:57.179 --> 36:00.315
I thought it was appropriate
for a moment like this.

36:18.433 --> 36:20.202
Where are you?

36:20.235 --> 36:21.336
There it is.

36:23.238 --> 36:24.373
Sorry.

36:24.406 --> 36:26.141
Just gotta find the quote.

36:36.118 --> 36:37.818
Here we go.

36:37.852 --> 36:39.221
It's from 1991,

36:39.254 --> 36:41.223
when Phil was coaching
the Chicago Bulls.

36:41.256 --> 36:43.392
They had just come off
a big playoff loss,

36:43.425 --> 36:45.394
and they were really down
on themselves.

36:45.427 --> 36:46.894
He knew, that in order for them

36:46.928 --> 36:48.397
to have a chance at the series,

36:48.430 --> 36:51.200
he was gonna have
to pick them up.

36:51.233 --> 36:54.336
"So I looked around the room
and said,"

36:54.369 --> 36:57.372
and I'm quoting now.

36:57.406 --> 37:01.809
"So I looked around the room
and said, 'Love is the force

37:01.842 --> 37:03.978
that ignites the spirit,

37:04.012 --> 37:05.947
and binds teams together.'"

37:09.351 --> 37:14.755
"Love is the force
that ignites the spirit,

37:14.789 --> 37:17.492
and binds teams together."

37:20.262 --> 37:22.897
What a great quote, huh?

37:22.930 --> 37:24.233
"Love is the force..."

37:24.266 --> 37:26.435
We got it, Brent, thank you.

37:26.468 --> 37:28.203
Anyways, I just...

37:28.237 --> 37:30.472
I want to share with you,
keep it in your heads.

37:30.505 --> 37:33.208
Maybe you'll
draw inspiration from it.

37:33.242 --> 37:34.509
What is it, Corey?

37:34.543 --> 37:37.045
Uh, can I get something
from my locker?

37:37.079 --> 37:39.114
Be fast.

37:41.149 --> 37:42.850
All right, um,

37:42.883 --> 37:45.520
let's get out there,
have a good second half.

37:45.554 --> 37:47.788
Come on, guys,
thanks for listening.

37:47.822 --> 37:49.091
You got it.

37:49.124 --> 37:50.858
Thanks for hearing me out.

37:50.891 --> 37:53.828
We can do this, you got it.

37:53.861 --> 37:56.198
Come on, you got it.

38:03.071 --> 38:04.972
Princess!

38:07.242 --> 38:09.478
Princess!

38:13.348 --> 38:15.350
Princess!

38:51.019 --> 38:54.122
Calgary down 5-1 to Atlanta
after two periods.

38:54.156 --> 38:55.324
We're gonna
go to the phones now.

38:55.357 --> 38:57.125
We have Terry in Calgary.

38:57.159 --> 38:59.027
Terry, what are your thoughts
on the first two periods?

38:59.061 --> 39:01.862
Thanks for having me on the air,
that's really cool.

39:01.896 --> 39:04.032
I just wanted to say that,
you know, like,

39:04.066 --> 39:06.501
how disappointed I am
with the team this year.

39:06.535 --> 39:09.504
They were supposed to be,
like, contenders this year,

39:09.538 --> 39:11.606
and, like, pardon my French,
but they're actually kinda,

39:11.640 --> 39:13.342
you know, shittin' the bed.

39:23.051 --> 39:24.619
Can I talk to you
for a second, Brent?

39:24.653 --> 39:26.887
Yeah, for sure,
what's up, Coach?

39:26.921 --> 39:29.458
I think it's time to drop
the whole Phil Jackson,

39:29.491 --> 39:31.526
triangle offense thing, okay?

39:31.560 --> 39:33.595
Oh, okay.

39:33.628 --> 39:36.331
It's becoming
a bit of a distraction.

39:36.365 --> 39:38.367
You know, I asked you
to be brief in there,

39:38.400 --> 39:40.669
and you went on
for what felt like 10 minutes.

39:40.702 --> 39:42.604
- Oh.
- We all need to focus

39:42.637 --> 39:44.373
on the game, okay?

39:44.406 --> 39:46.074
Okay.

39:48.643 --> 39:50.545
I'll pay you.

39:50.579 --> 39:53.148
- Pardon me?
- I'll pay you 50 bucks.

39:53.181 --> 39:55.183
Just let me run the triangle
for 10 minutes in the game.

39:55.217 --> 39:57.185
Brent, this is
wildly inappropriate.

39:57.219 --> 39:58.487
Okay, 100.

40:00.489 --> 40:02.357
I'll pay you $100.

40:02.391 --> 40:05.560
Okay, I don't I can
go any higher than that,

40:05.594 --> 40:08.363
unless you'd be okay
with a check.

40:33.221 --> 40:35.624
Okay, uh, so, so there,

40:35.657 --> 40:38.527
and then, yeah, right,
and then we... okay, yeah, okay,

40:38.560 --> 40:40.662
great, so, let's go out there
and play hard.

40:40.695 --> 40:42.597
Let's forget about the score

40:42.631 --> 40:44.666
and try and have
a good half, hm?

40:44.699 --> 40:47.035
- Well, what is it, Joel?
- Uh, I'm not necessarily

40:47.068 --> 40:49.237
suggesting we do this, coach,
but I'm just curious

40:49.271 --> 40:52.140
what the procedure might be
regarding forfeiting the game.

40:52.174 --> 40:54.276
We're not forfeiting
the game, Joel.

40:54.309 --> 40:57.045
It's just that... again,
this is totally theoretical,

40:57.078 --> 41:00.682
- but with the score the way...
- We're not forfeiting.

41:00.715 --> 41:03.984
It's just there's no chance
of a comeback here,

41:04.019 --> 41:06.221
and we still have
our dignities to think about.

41:06.254 --> 41:07.689
"Defense," on three.

41:10.158 --> 41:13.328
- One, two, three, defense!
- One, two, three, defense.

41:15.230 --> 41:17.098
So, that's definitely
a "No" there, hey, Coach?

41:17.132 --> 41:18.333
'Cause I was thinking
we could probably

41:18.366 --> 41:19.501
talk to the refs over there.

41:27.776 --> 41:30.579
What took you so long?

41:30.612 --> 41:33.148
Fuck are you doing?

41:34.483 --> 41:36.117
You're an idiot.

42:08.717 --> 42:11.219
- Uh, hey.
- Hi.

42:11.253 --> 42:14.222
I was wondering
if I could join your sit-in.

42:14.256 --> 42:16.091
Oh, yeah, of course.

42:16.124 --> 42:17.492
Have a seat.

42:21.730 --> 42:23.431
Thank you for coming.

42:23.465 --> 42:24.833
Yeah, no problem.

42:28.169 --> 42:31.606
I'm sorry for getting
so emotional earlier.

42:31.640 --> 42:35.110
I know that as co-founder

42:35.143 --> 42:38.380
and current treasurer
I should be more level headed,

42:38.413 --> 42:40.815
but I don't know.

42:43.118 --> 42:45.687
Sometimes I just wonder
if Danica cares more about

42:45.720 --> 42:48.623
being provocative
than producing truly great work.

42:48.657 --> 42:50.825
- You know?
- Mhm.

42:50.859 --> 42:53.128
I mean,

42:53.161 --> 42:55.864
sometimes I think it's okay
to just play Shakespeare

42:55.897 --> 42:58.366
as Shakespeare intended,
you know?

42:58.400 --> 43:00.201
Totally, yeah.

43:02.203 --> 43:04.639
I don't know,
perhaps I'm old fashioned.

43:04.673 --> 43:06.308
Mhm.

43:12.213 --> 43:14.249
Let's go!

43:16.851 --> 43:19.654
Uh, hey, Coach.

43:19.688 --> 43:21.823
I'm... I'm sorry about
the whole forfeiting thing.

43:21.856 --> 43:23.425
It's fine, Joel.

43:23.458 --> 43:25.860
- It was out of line.
- Don't worry about it.

43:25.894 --> 43:28.330
You know, there's something
to be said about sticking it out

43:28.363 --> 43:29.731
- until the end.
- Hm.

43:29.764 --> 43:31.733
Even if
it's completely hopeless.

43:31.766 --> 43:34.469
It's noble, I get that.

43:34.502 --> 43:37.172
Hustle, hustle!

43:38.840 --> 43:41.576
Um, I'm just curious,

43:41.610 --> 43:43.812
did something happen with Brent?

43:43.845 --> 43:45.847
He looks really sad,

43:45.880 --> 43:48.316
like, even more than usual.

44:00.929 --> 44:02.897
So, this is a sit-in?

44:02.931 --> 44:04.566
Mhm.

44:06.434 --> 44:10.205
Um, are we supposed to,
like, chant or something?

44:10.238 --> 44:14.242
No, I think it's more about
occupying the space,

44:14.275 --> 44:16.211
symbolically.

44:16.244 --> 44:18.346
Cool.

44:24.719 --> 44:26.888
Who's man is that?

44:26.921 --> 44:28.690
Who? I don't know.

44:35.263 --> 44:42.370
No more will our voices
be silented.

44:42.404 --> 44:44.973
Will our voice...

44:46.708 --> 44:49.277
- Hey.
- Hey.

44:49.310 --> 44:51.446
My brother was so pissed.

44:51.479 --> 44:52.681
He said his Nintendo
didn't save,

44:52.714 --> 44:55.216
so he lost his game.

44:57.786 --> 44:59.921
- Man, blood is heavy.
- Wow,

44:59.954 --> 45:02.390
that's a lot of blood.

45:02.424 --> 45:04.526
Oh, we've got way more
in my garage.

45:06.028 --> 45:08.663
So, should we open it?

45:08.697 --> 45:10.498
Sure.

45:18.606 --> 45:19.908
Come on.

45:29.617 --> 45:31.853
Help me out.

45:36.324 --> 45:37.859
Ew.

45:46.468 --> 45:48.236
Princess!

45:52.407 --> 45:53.708
Princess!

45:59.547 --> 46:01.649
Thought it might be
a little busier.

46:01.683 --> 46:03.685
Uh, yeah.

46:05.787 --> 46:07.756
Guess it's not much of a sit-in

46:07.789 --> 46:11.426
when there are
no people to see it.

46:11.459 --> 46:12.961
- Yeah.
- I mean,

46:12.994 --> 46:15.296
I think it is still
an important action,

46:15.330 --> 46:17.599
- symbolically.
- Yeah, totally.

46:19.534 --> 46:21.369
But, it would be nice

46:21.402 --> 46:24.073
if someone saw us.

46:24.106 --> 46:26.274
Hm.

46:31.346 --> 46:34.049
So, Claire?

46:34.083 --> 46:35.917
- Mhm.
- I was wondering

46:35.950 --> 46:38.686
if maybe you and I could

46:38.720 --> 46:41.623
catch a movie sometime.

46:41.656 --> 46:44.526
- Oh.
- Yeah, like, um,

46:44.559 --> 46:46.661
have you seen The Matrix yet?

46:46.694 --> 46:48.997
- The Matrix?
- Yeah, with Keanu Reeves,

46:49.031 --> 46:51.900
- and, um...
- No, I haven't.

46:51.933 --> 46:53.868
Oh, yeah, well it's really good,

46:53.902 --> 46:56.371
so, um, I've seen it already,

46:56.404 --> 46:59.074
but I would love
to see it again, and...

46:59.108 --> 47:01.543
Oh,

47:01.576 --> 47:05.346
and would this be, like, a date?

47:05.380 --> 47:07.816
Yeah, that's... that's what
I was thinking it would be,

47:07.849 --> 47:11.452
'cause, um, I've done
a lot of, you know, planning,

47:11.486 --> 47:13.888
- and...
- Um, well.

47:16.691 --> 47:20.129
I'm already dating someone.

47:20.162 --> 47:22.530
Oh, oh.

47:24.566 --> 47:26.701
For how long?

47:26.734 --> 47:29.004
Almost two years, actually.

47:31.573 --> 47:33.842
Oh.

47:33.875 --> 47:35.810
Um.

47:35.844 --> 47:37.645
It's monogamous?

47:37.679 --> 47:39.081
Yes.

47:39.114 --> 47:41.382
Ah.

47:41.416 --> 47:44.019
Cool, well, um,

47:44.053 --> 47:47.589
nevermind then, whatever, yeah.

47:47.622 --> 47:49.124
Yeah.

47:53.661 --> 47:55.763
Um,

47:55.797 --> 47:58.666
is that why
you joined the sit-in?

48:01.536 --> 48:03.404
Yeah, pretty much.

48:11.646 --> 48:13.648
Oh, shit.

48:18.220 --> 48:20.955
It's frozen.

48:20.989 --> 48:23.158
Princess.

48:26.228 --> 48:28.097
Princess.

48:33.801 --> 48:35.837
Princess.

48:38.706 --> 48:40.642
Ah, man.

49:29.657 --> 49:32.894
Brent.

49:32.927 --> 49:35.630
I'm sorry, I just don't think
it's a good idea for right now.

49:37.565 --> 49:39.968
You know, it's a lot
to throw at them.

49:40.001 --> 49:42.071
I mean, look at them.

49:42.104 --> 49:43.838
They can barely understand
this offense.

49:43.871 --> 49:45.974
Yeah.

49:46.008 --> 49:48.876
I know, I understand.

49:48.910 --> 49:50.945
So, are you just gonna...?

49:53.148 --> 49:55.516
- Brent.
- What?

49:55.550 --> 49:58.053
Are you just gonna sit like this
for the whole game?

49:58.087 --> 49:59.587
Whatever.

50:16.971 --> 50:18.740
Fine.

50:18.773 --> 50:20.142
- Five minutes.
- Seriously?

50:20.175 --> 50:22.244
You get to do this
one time, Brent.

50:22.277 --> 50:24.879
Yeah, for sure, hey,
can I do it for 10 minutes?

50:24.912 --> 50:26.148
'Cause I feel like 5
is not enough time...

50:26.181 --> 50:29.084
- Brent.
- Yeah, 5 is fine.

50:29.118 --> 50:30.985
I'm gonna get my diagrams.

50:37.259 --> 50:40.129
Son of a...

50:42.997 --> 50:45.167
This isn't working.

50:47.102 --> 50:50.239
Yeah, it's probably gonna
take too long to thaw out.

50:50.272 --> 50:51.973
Sorry.

50:52.007 --> 50:53.208
It's okay.

50:54.976 --> 50:56.711
I don't think
it's real blood anyways.

50:56.744 --> 50:59.248
Pretty sure I saw my brother
making it in the bathtub.

51:04.053 --> 51:05.653
You can go if you want.

51:05.686 --> 51:08.157
- Uh, no, it's... it's fine.
- No, really, it's...

51:08.190 --> 51:09.924
It's, um, I...

51:09.957 --> 51:11.826
It's okay.

51:14.196 --> 51:15.997
I guess it is a little late.

51:16.031 --> 51:17.799
Um.

51:17.832 --> 51:20.102
You know, my mom's,
like, always on my ass

51:20.135 --> 51:22.937
about curfew and, like,
you know.

51:22.970 --> 51:25.873
I... I should go.

51:25.907 --> 51:28.310
I'm gonna go.

51:30.245 --> 51:31.746
Sorry, um,

51:31.779 --> 51:34.882
- but I'll see you tomorrow?
- It's okay.

51:34.916 --> 51:36.751
- Yeah.
- Bye.

51:44.393 --> 51:46.195
What if we just, like, got naked

51:46.228 --> 51:49.231
and ran through the gym?

51:49.264 --> 51:51.699
Like, streaking?

51:51.732 --> 51:53.402
Yeah, but like, we could write,
"Fuck the patriarchy"

51:53.435 --> 51:55.370
on our boobs or something.

52:00.875 --> 52:04.745
So, if the trigger
moves to the off-wing,

52:04.779 --> 52:07.748
the flex moves to the, uh...

52:27.935 --> 52:30.372
- Hey.
- What the hell's going on?

52:30.405 --> 52:32.241
I was giving my sister a bath.

52:32.274 --> 52:33.808
Sorry, you know.

52:35.810 --> 52:37.079
I wouldn't have asked you to
come here if I didn't think

52:37.112 --> 52:39.314
- it was necessary.
- What happened?

52:41.283 --> 52:43.252
- Well...
- Ken,

52:43.285 --> 52:45.920
what happened?

52:45.953 --> 52:47.755
The dog.

52:50.259 --> 52:52.261
The dog's gone.

52:52.294 --> 52:55.430
What do you mean,
"The dog's gone"?

52:55.464 --> 52:57.099
Well,

52:57.132 --> 53:00.068
she...

53:00.102 --> 53:02.371
- she escaped.
- Escaped?

53:04.506 --> 53:06.108
You didn't close
the latch properly

53:06.141 --> 53:07.742
on the kennel, did you?

53:07.775 --> 53:09.877
I thought I did.

53:09.911 --> 53:13.382
- Did you do this on purpose?
- What?

53:13.415 --> 53:15.750
No, I didn't do it on purpose.

53:17.752 --> 53:20.389
I wouldn't do that, Karen.

53:20.422 --> 53:22.723
Oh, that's ridiculous.

53:22.757 --> 53:24.493
All right, guys,
we're finally gonna do it.

53:24.526 --> 53:26.727
We're gonna run
the triangle offense, okay?

53:26.761 --> 53:28.297
I mean, are you gonna
tell us how it works?

53:28.330 --> 53:29.997
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, I don't really understand

53:30.032 --> 53:32.401
what we're doing, is this, like,
some kind of new offense?

53:32.434 --> 53:34.269
- It is, okay.
- Sounds complicated.

53:34.303 --> 53:35.504
- It's not that...
- You got one minute, Brent.

53:35.537 --> 53:37.439
It's not that complicated, okay?

53:37.472 --> 53:41.376
And thus, with this symbolic...

53:43.778 --> 53:45.447
- Tessa.
- Sorry, just...

53:47.282 --> 53:50.419
So, as you can see right here,
we got your wing, your mid-post,

53:50.452 --> 53:52.853
and your corner sh...

53:52.887 --> 53:54.755
Uh, sorry, this...
this is upside down.

53:54.789 --> 53:57.059
- 20 seconds.
- All right.

53:57.092 --> 54:00.028
With this symbolic unveiling...

54:01.496 --> 54:02.863
Dude.

54:02.897 --> 54:04.266
We gotta keep the ball moving.

54:04.299 --> 54:06.435
Remember, it's about
turning their strengths

54:06.468 --> 54:08.437
into weaknesses, okay?

54:08.470 --> 54:10.539
So, they're gonna be looking
for places where they could

54:10.572 --> 54:13.508
post up on you, but because
we're moving the ball so quick,

54:13.542 --> 54:15.143
we get her over to the wing,

54:15.177 --> 54:16.877
we swing it over
to the corner shooter.

54:16.911 --> 54:19.381
Boom, can you hit that 3?
I've seen you hit that 3.

54:19.414 --> 54:21.283
You can do it,
you hit that 3, okay, guys?

54:21.316 --> 54:22.451
- That's time.
- So, remember,

54:22.484 --> 54:24.286
it's just about passing.

54:24.319 --> 54:26.154
You did this so we wouldn't
have to pay for

54:26.188 --> 54:28.357
- the osteoporosis medication.
- Are you kidding me right now?

54:28.390 --> 54:31.393
No, I saw your face when the vet
told us how much it would cost.

54:31.426 --> 54:34.029
We don't even know
if she has osteoporosis.

54:34.062 --> 54:35.497
So, that makes it okay?

54:35.530 --> 54:38.133
I didn't say that.

54:38.166 --> 54:41.336
Look, maybe we can
get a new dog.

54:41.370 --> 54:43.138
What, a lab?

54:43.171 --> 54:46.375
I don't know, maybe.

54:46.408 --> 54:47.942
If you want one.

54:47.975 --> 54:49.478
You did this
so that we could get a lab.

54:49.511 --> 54:51.013
No, I did not.

54:53.115 --> 54:54.483
Do you want a lab?

54:56.318 --> 54:58.153
No, no, no, but it's like...

54:58.186 --> 55:02.057
No, no, you move to the corner
when the trigger has the ball.

55:02.090 --> 55:03.558
Guys, remember, spacing.

55:03.592 --> 55:05.826
Space the ball, space the court.

55:07.429 --> 55:09.897
Never been to
a basketball game before.

55:11.266 --> 55:13.968
There's not very many people.

55:14.001 --> 55:16.338
Yeah, our team kinda sucks.

55:16.371 --> 55:18.173
Fo... focus, oh, yeah,
bring it in, bring it in,

55:18.206 --> 55:19.574
bring it... slow...
slow down, slow down.

55:19.608 --> 55:21.510
Stay up on your man,
stay up on your man,

55:21.543 --> 55:23.011
stay up on your man, yeah.

55:23.045 --> 55:24.912
Get the ball, go, go,
fast break, fast break.

55:24.945 --> 55:27.349
Move the ball, move...

55:27.382 --> 55:29.418
Mid-post, trigger, wing!

55:29.451 --> 55:31.620
I made it very clear.

55:31.653 --> 55:33.455
Oh, shit.

55:33.488 --> 55:35.023
What?

55:35.057 --> 55:38.160
That's Mr. Davidson,
he's my English teacher.

55:38.193 --> 55:40.162
- With the beard?
- Yeah.

55:40.195 --> 55:42.130
He's kinda cute.

55:42.164 --> 55:44.232
Fine, we'll get
another Shih Tzu.

55:44.266 --> 55:47.035
I don't care, Karen.

55:47.069 --> 55:49.638
Karen, come on!

55:49.671 --> 55:53.041
Oh, fine, I'll keep looking.

55:53.075 --> 55:55.010
Oh, she's gotta be
around here somewhere.

55:55.043 --> 55:56.611
I'll put up posters.

55:56.645 --> 55:59.081
Okay, you're too close,
space it out, space...

56:03.018 --> 56:05.220
So, you don't wanna do it?

56:05.253 --> 56:07.888
It's not that
I don't want to do it.

56:07.922 --> 56:10.425
I'm just thinking
maybe we're giving them

56:10.459 --> 56:12.627
their patriarchal fantasy
too easily.

56:12.661 --> 56:15.530
Like, I don't wanna
play into that, you know?

56:15.564 --> 56:17.998
I don't know,
I just thought it'd be funny.

56:18.033 --> 56:20.469
Well, also, there's like
hardly anyone in there,

56:20.502 --> 56:22.970
and if we're gonna do it,
we should do it for an audience,

56:23.004 --> 56:24.439
right?

56:24.473 --> 56:27.476
It can't be
any more simple, okay?

56:27.509 --> 56:29.344
You are the... you are the wing!

56:29.378 --> 56:32.314
Yeah, so, um...

56:34.516 --> 56:37.386
I mean, I have to
catch my bus anyway.

56:39.221 --> 56:40.422
Sorry.

56:45.727 --> 56:47.596
This sucks!

56:53.635 --> 56:56.037
Phooey.

57:23.665 --> 57:26.034
All right, guys,
this is our last timeout,

57:26.067 --> 57:27.669
- so listen carefully.
- I don't like

57:27.702 --> 57:30.005
- the triangle offense.
- Yeah, it's really complicated.

57:30.038 --> 57:32.474
It's simple if you know
the basics to it, all right?

57:32.507 --> 57:34.443
I don't get the whole thing
about the post.

57:34.476 --> 57:36.445
Yeah, and the trigger,
what even is that?

57:36.478 --> 57:38.380
- Well, let me explain, okay?
- Can we go back

57:38.413 --> 57:40.215
- to our old offense?
- We're not gonna go back

57:40.248 --> 57:42.484
to the old offense, we're gonna
run the triangle offense.

57:42.517 --> 57:44.085
We should run
a Princeton offense.

57:44.119 --> 57:45.620
- What's the Princeton offense?
- I don't know.

57:45.654 --> 57:47.756
I saw it on TV, but there's
a whole lot of cutting

57:47.789 --> 57:50.425
- and passing.
- Sounds pretty good.

57:50.459 --> 57:52.160
- Did we learn the Princeton...?
- We're not running

57:52.194 --> 57:55.063
the Princeton offense!

57:55.096 --> 57:56.665
- Brent, just calm down, man.
- Why?

57:56.698 --> 57:59.701
Because we're gonna keep running
the triangle offense, all right?

57:59.734 --> 58:01.636
And I don't wanna hear
a Goddamn thing

58:01.670 --> 58:03.638
about the Princeton offense,
okay?

58:03.672 --> 58:07.209
Jesus, are you idiots
listening to anything I said?

58:07.242 --> 58:08.543
Have you heard anything, huh?

58:08.577 --> 58:10.479
- Come on!
- Brent, can you come with me

58:10.512 --> 58:11.646
- for a minute?
- No!

58:11.680 --> 58:13.348
Okay, come on, let's go.

58:13.381 --> 58:15.650
Come on.

58:40.609 --> 58:42.644
It's just basketball, Brent.

58:42.677 --> 58:44.412
Why aren't they listening to me?

58:44.446 --> 58:46.147
It's so simple
if they just listened.

58:46.181 --> 58:47.682
Yeah, well,
give the players some credit.

58:47.716 --> 58:49.451
It's a lot to throw at them
all at once.

58:49.484 --> 58:52.120
And, you know,
it's been a tough game.

58:52.153 --> 58:53.622
You know what?

58:53.655 --> 58:57.058
Winners accept challenges,
they don't shirk away from them.

58:57.092 --> 58:59.294
Phil Jackson talks about this
all the time.

58:59.327 --> 59:00.829
Come on, Coach, come on.

59:00.862 --> 59:03.265
Do these kids
have any fight in them?

59:03.298 --> 59:05.600
- It's pathetic!
- All right, I think you should

59:05.634 --> 59:07.435
cool down in the office
for the rest of the game, okay?

59:07.469 --> 59:09.237
Ugh, no, no, no!

59:09.271 --> 59:10.572
I'm fine, I...

59:10.605 --> 59:12.173
I'm fine, I'll be fine.

59:14.576 --> 59:16.578
No, I just need to explain
to them, they'll get it.

59:16.611 --> 59:18.547
Yeah... no,
I need to explain to them.

59:18.580 --> 59:20.749
I... more charts, they'll get it.

59:20.782 --> 59:22.651
- Brent.
- No, stop!

59:22.684 --> 59:24.519
- Brent!
- Stop!

59:24.553 --> 59:25.754
Brent.

59:25.787 --> 59:27.656
So, I, uh...

59:27.689 --> 59:30.692
I guess we're supposed to
coach ourselves now, eh?

59:30.725 --> 59:33.261
Yeah, I guess so.

59:36.164 --> 59:37.699
What a game.

59:37.732 --> 59:41.136
Yeah, what a game.

59:41.169 --> 59:42.771
How many more do we have left?

59:42.804 --> 59:44.706
- Come on, boys!
- Three.

59:46.908 --> 59:49.277
No, sorry, we have four,

59:49.311 --> 59:51.513
- and a tournament.
- Right, right.

59:52.847 --> 59:55.584
On the rebound!

01:00:01.256 --> 01:00:03.491
You know if we're getting
the pizza party this year?

01:00:03.525 --> 01:00:05.327
I'm not sure.

01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:09.164
I heard maybe not,
'cause budget cuts or something.

01:00:17.505 --> 01:00:19.708
Fuck the patriarchy!

01:00:19.741 --> 01:00:22.377
That girl is totally naked.

01:00:26.281 --> 01:00:28.149
Fuck the patriarchy!

01:00:28.183 --> 01:00:30.352
Woo!

01:00:45.233 --> 01:00:47.869
Hey, sorry.

01:00:47.902 --> 01:00:51.473
What'd I miss?

01:00:55.777 --> 01:00:57.746
Okay, boys, bring it in.

01:00:59.848 --> 01:01:02.517
- Who was that girl?
- Think she's in my bio class.

01:01:02.550 --> 01:01:05.186
- She's like a Theater Extremist.
- Oh, that's right.

01:01:05.220 --> 01:01:07.322
I knew I recognized her
from somewhere.

01:01:07.355 --> 01:01:09.357
What's Theater Extremist?

01:01:09.391 --> 01:01:11.793
Uh, it's like
a radical theater group.

01:01:11.826 --> 01:01:14.896
Yeah, they did a production of
Death of a Salesman last year,

01:01:14.929 --> 01:01:16.698
except they switched
all the genders,

01:01:16.731 --> 01:01:18.533
so it was Death of a Saleswoman.

01:01:18.566 --> 01:01:20.235
What did she yell at the end?

01:01:20.268 --> 01:01:21.770
I couldn't understand.

01:01:21.803 --> 01:01:24.406
I think she said,
"Fuck the patriarchy."

01:01:24.439 --> 01:01:25.740
What's the patriarchy?

01:01:25.774 --> 01:01:27.742
Well, essentially
it's the idea that...

01:01:27.776 --> 01:01:30.645
All right, guys.

01:01:30.679 --> 01:01:32.580
So, um,

01:01:32.614 --> 01:01:34.482
that was a tough game.

01:01:34.516 --> 01:01:36.351
Does it still count as a loss,
even though that girl

01:01:36.384 --> 01:01:38.353
- ran on the court naked?
- Yes, Joel.

01:01:38.386 --> 01:01:40.889
So, it's not like
a force majeure-type situation?

01:01:40.922 --> 01:01:43.324
No.

01:01:43.358 --> 01:01:45.593
Uh, I don't think there's
too much to say about this one.

01:01:45.627 --> 01:01:47.262
I think this is just
one of those games

01:01:47.295 --> 01:01:49.230
we just forget about
and move on.

01:01:49.264 --> 01:01:50.799
- What happened to Brent?
- Yeah,

01:01:50.832 --> 01:01:53.668
- is he kicked off the team?
- No, he's not kicked off.

01:01:53.702 --> 01:01:55.603
Can we not use
the triangle offense anymore?

01:01:55.637 --> 01:01:57.605
- I hate it.
- Yeah, me too.

01:01:57.639 --> 01:01:59.607
We're not going to use
the triangle offense anymore,

01:01:59.641 --> 01:02:01.676
- no.
- Okay, good.

01:02:01.710 --> 01:02:03.945
Like I said, I think it's best
if we just forget about tonight

01:02:03.978 --> 01:02:06.015
- and focus on next week.
- Uh, who are we playing

01:02:06.048 --> 01:02:07.716
- next week?
- Holy Cross.

01:02:07.749 --> 01:02:09.384
Are they any good?

01:02:09.417 --> 01:02:11.586
- They're a pretty good team.
- Apparently they got

01:02:11.619 --> 01:02:14.489
this 7-footer from, like,
Ecuador or somewhere.

01:02:14.522 --> 01:02:16.658
He's got a scholarship
to some school in the States.

01:02:16.691 --> 01:02:18.426
- Whoa.
- Uh-huh.

01:02:18.460 --> 01:02:20.628
Yeah, he broke the backboard
against Saint Luke's.

01:02:20.662 --> 01:02:23.364
He dunked on
this one kid so hard...

01:02:23.398 --> 01:02:26.634
They're a pretty good team,
let's leave it at that.

01:02:26.668 --> 01:02:28.603
All right, uh,
no practice tomorrow,

01:02:28.636 --> 01:02:31.040
but we'll get going again
on Monday.

01:02:31.073 --> 01:02:33.708
All right, have a good weekend.

01:02:33.742 --> 01:02:35.443
- Thanks, Coach.
- Thanks, Coach.

01:02:37.345 --> 01:02:38.680
What happened
to the guy he dunked on?

01:02:38.713 --> 01:02:40.949
Well, apparently
he broke his orbital bone,

01:02:40.982 --> 01:02:44.019
so now he's gotta wear
one of those cones,

01:02:44.053 --> 01:02:46.521
you know, the big plastic ones,
so he doesn't bump into things.

01:02:46.554 --> 01:02:48.823
- The things that dogs wear?
- Yeah.

01:02:48.857 --> 01:02:51.726
- Jeez.
- Uh-huh.

01:03:01.770 --> 01:03:03.304
Look, I'm sorry.

01:03:05.740 --> 01:03:07.609
There's nothing I can do.

01:03:11.713 --> 01:03:14.083
It was out of my hands.

01:03:17.719 --> 01:03:19.988
I was trying to find my dog.

01:03:24.659 --> 01:03:26.594
Fine.

01:03:28.797 --> 01:03:29.964
Come on.

01:03:31.966 --> 01:03:34.636
Let's go for a drink.

01:03:34.669 --> 01:03:37.072
Are you kidding me?

01:03:37.106 --> 01:03:38.807
- Let's go for a drink?
- Yeah.

01:03:38.840 --> 01:03:40.909
Yeah, cool, I'll just
totally miss my meeting

01:03:40.942 --> 01:03:43.778
- that I'm late for.
- Oh, right, yeah, you're, uh...

01:03:43.812 --> 01:03:45.880
Yeah, yeah,
my Toastmasters meeting,

01:03:45.914 --> 01:03:47.448
you know, like,
the one I told you about

01:03:47.482 --> 01:03:49.350
three fucking times.

01:03:49.384 --> 01:03:51.820
Sorry, okay?

01:03:51.853 --> 01:03:53.454
No, it's not okay.

01:03:53.488 --> 01:03:55.790
See, I'm late for my stuff now
because you were

01:03:55.824 --> 01:03:57.559
pissing around all game.

01:03:59.094 --> 01:04:01.596
I wasn't
pissing around all game.

01:04:03.765 --> 01:04:06.768
I was looking for my dog.

01:04:10.972 --> 01:04:12.707
Idiot.

01:04:20.782 --> 01:04:24.086
Sorry, I'm just here
to get my backpack.

01:04:31.593 --> 01:04:33.928
How was the sit-in?

01:04:33.962 --> 01:04:37.032
Oh, uh, it was...

01:04:37.066 --> 01:04:39.567
okay.

01:04:39.601 --> 01:04:41.669
Um, did you do the blood thing?

01:04:43.972 --> 01:04:46.674
It didn't really work out.

01:04:46.708 --> 01:04:49.144
- Oh.
- We were going to, um,

01:04:49.178 --> 01:04:52.413
take off all our clothes
and run through the gym naked,

01:04:52.447 --> 01:04:55.084
but I don't know,

01:04:55.117 --> 01:04:58.620
I... I don't think
we need to rush it.

01:04:58.653 --> 01:05:01.422
Yeah.

01:05:01.456 --> 01:05:03.524
You know,

01:05:03.558 --> 01:05:07.162
I do think you had a point.

01:05:07.196 --> 01:05:08.930
Hanging the effigy
of Jean Chretien

01:05:08.963 --> 01:05:11.532
may have been a bit much.

01:05:11.566 --> 01:05:13.768
- Really?
- I mean,

01:05:13.801 --> 01:05:15.204
I still think

01:05:15.237 --> 01:05:18.873
there's something
interesting there,

01:05:18.907 --> 01:05:21.609
but,

01:05:21.643 --> 01:05:23.145
I don't know,

01:05:23.178 --> 01:05:26.514
maybe we just need more time
to unpack the concept.

01:05:26.547 --> 01:05:28.783
I think that's
a really good idea.

01:05:31.753 --> 01:05:33.988
Where's Tessa?

01:05:34.023 --> 01:05:36.025
I'm not sure.

01:05:51.773 --> 01:05:54.109
To be honest, it's probably
one of the best movies

01:05:54.143 --> 01:05:56.611
- ever made.
- Ever made, really?

01:05:56.644 --> 01:05:59.214
- Yeah, absolutely.
- Even better than The Godfather?

01:05:59.248 --> 01:06:01.216
Way better than The Godfather?

01:06:01.250 --> 01:06:03.018
Better than Citizen Kane?

01:06:03.052 --> 01:06:04.752
I haven't seen Citizen Kane.

01:06:04.786 --> 01:06:07.522
- You haven't seen Citizen Kane?
- What's Citizen Kane?

01:06:07.555 --> 01:06:10.892
It's like the number one movie
on AFI's Top 100 list.

01:06:10.925 --> 01:06:12.927
- What's AFI?
- You really think The Matrix

01:06:12.961 --> 01:06:15.496
- is better than The Godfather?
- To be honest,

01:06:15.530 --> 01:06:17.199
The Godfather is overrated.

01:06:17.232 --> 01:06:19.567
- Oh, my God.
- I'm not saying it's bad.

01:06:19.600 --> 01:06:22.037
I just don't think it's
the greatest movie of all time.

01:06:22.071 --> 01:06:23.538
I don't even think
it's the greatest

01:06:23.571 --> 01:06:25.707
Francis Ford Coppola movie
of all time.

01:06:25.740 --> 01:06:27.242
So what is, Apocalypse Now?

01:06:27.276 --> 01:06:29.677
- Mm, no.
- Godfather 2?

01:06:29.711 --> 01:06:31.180
Godfather 2
is even more overrated

01:06:31.213 --> 01:06:34.116
- than Godfather 1.
- You don't like Godfather 2?

01:06:34.149 --> 01:06:36.151
No.

01:06:36.185 --> 01:06:39.054
Okay, so then what is
the best Coppola movie then?

01:06:39.088 --> 01:06:41.990
Personally, I think it's Jack.

01:06:42.024 --> 01:06:43.758
- Jack?
- Yeah.

01:06:43.791 --> 01:06:46.527
- The one with Robin Williams?
- Francis Ford Coppola made that?

01:06:46.561 --> 01:06:48.763
- Yeah.
- The one where Robin Williams

01:06:48.796 --> 01:06:50.132
plays a kid
who looks like an adult?

01:06:50.165 --> 01:06:51.766
- Yeah.
- And you think that's better

01:06:51.799 --> 01:06:55.536
- than The Godfather?
- It's a really well done movie.

01:06:55.570 --> 01:06:58.639
Can somebody please tell me
what AFI is?

01:07:10.352 --> 01:07:13.888
- Hey, Coach.
- Uh, hi, Brent.

01:07:13.921 --> 01:07:15.190
I just wanted to say
I'm really sorry.

01:07:15.224 --> 01:07:17.092
- It... it's fine, Brent.
- I had some time

01:07:17.126 --> 01:07:18.893
to think about it thanks to you,

01:07:18.926 --> 01:07:21.963
and I realized my actions
were really inappropriate.

01:07:21.996 --> 01:07:25.267
Well, yeah,
we all have our days.

01:07:25.300 --> 01:07:27.702
- I wanna give you this.
- What is this?

01:07:27.735 --> 01:07:29.637
Open it.

01:07:29.670 --> 01:07:32.174
I think that in light
of everything that's happened,

01:07:32.207 --> 01:07:34.575
I wanna formally submit
my resignation

01:07:34.609 --> 01:07:36.878
as the Assistant Coach
of the Middleview Ducks'

01:07:36.911 --> 01:07:39.248
senior boys' basketball team.

01:07:39.281 --> 01:07:42.317
You... you typed all this up
just now?

01:07:42.351 --> 01:07:45.254
I had one ready
just in case anything happened.

01:07:45.287 --> 01:07:48.190
Coach?

01:07:48.223 --> 01:07:50.192
You misspelled "opportunity."

01:07:50.225 --> 01:07:52.660
I was thinking,
instead of doing King Lear,

01:07:52.693 --> 01:07:54.196
we could do, like,
Twelfth Night.

01:07:54.229 --> 01:07:56.231
- Oh, I love Twelfth Night.
- It would be

01:07:56.265 --> 01:07:59.201
such a cool opportunity to play
with gender and sexuality.

01:07:59.234 --> 01:08:01.203
- Oh, absolutely.
- And I was thinking,

01:08:01.236 --> 01:08:04.939
maybe Sebastian and Viola
can be, like, conjoined twins.

01:08:04.972 --> 01:08:07.342
Yeah, yeah,
that would complicate

01:08:07.376 --> 01:08:10.212
the timeline slightly,

01:08:10.245 --> 01:08:13.815
but it could be an exciting
dramaturgical challenge.

01:08:26.993 --> 01:08:30.032
What a fricken day.

01:08:45.947 --> 01:08:49.017
And with a miraculous comeback,
Calgary comes from behind

01:08:49.051 --> 01:08:50.685
to defeat Atlanta in overtime.

01:08:50.718 --> 01:08:52.321
- And what a comeback it was.
- Holy shit.

01:08:52.354 --> 01:08:53.988
I mean, you could see
in the third period,

01:08:54.022 --> 01:08:55.790
the team just looked different.

01:08:55.823 --> 01:08:57.059
They had a jump in their step,

01:08:57.091 --> 01:08:58.725
and boy,
did they look motivated.

01:08:58.759 --> 01:09:00.162
- No fricken way.
- You love to see that kind

01:09:00.194 --> 01:09:03.165
- of response after...
- Jeez, that's awesome.

01:09:03.198 --> 01:09:05.733
Absolutely, Jim,
you're completely right.

01:09:05.765 --> 01:09:07.102
I think...

01:09:07.136 --> 01:09:09.304
Okay, um,

01:09:09.337 --> 01:09:11.073
what about a suspension?

01:09:11.106 --> 01:09:12.874
I'm not going to suspend you.

01:09:12.907 --> 01:09:15.776
Oh, um,

01:09:15.810 --> 01:09:18.279
all right, okay, I got it.

01:09:18.313 --> 01:09:21.416
I'll apologize to you
and the entire team.

01:09:21.450 --> 01:09:24.086
- Really not necessary.
- Ugh.

01:09:24.118 --> 01:09:26.388
Okay, what if
I run laps at practice?

01:09:26.421 --> 01:09:28.256
We don't have practice tomorrow.

01:09:28.290 --> 01:09:29.957
Oh.

01:09:29.991 --> 01:09:31.759
Brent.

01:09:34.229 --> 01:09:37.432
There's an old coach's saying:

01:09:37.466 --> 01:09:42.404
"True leadership is not
about enforcing your will.

01:09:42.437 --> 01:09:45.274
It's about learning
the art of letting go."

01:09:48.876 --> 01:09:52.481
So, am I still a coach then?

01:09:52.514 --> 01:09:54.283
Bye, Brent.

01:10:18.273 --> 01:10:22.010
Again, Calgary with a miraculous
come-from-behind win in Atlanta.

01:10:24.112 --> 01:10:26.381
Come on.

01:10:30.885 --> 01:10:34.289
Come on, start, come on.

01:10:58.447 --> 01:11:01.816
Honestly,
it's a really interesting movie.

01:11:01.849 --> 01:11:04.386
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah, Jennifer Lopez

01:11:04.419 --> 01:11:06.355
- plays his teacher.
- Huh.

01:11:06.388 --> 01:11:09.224
They had this weird
kind of sexual tension.

01:11:09.258 --> 01:11:11.926
Robin Williams's character
and Jennifer Lopez's character?

01:11:11.959 --> 01:11:13.295
Yeah.

01:11:13.328 --> 01:11:14.529
- That is weird.
- Yeah,

01:11:14.563 --> 01:11:17.199
Bill Cosby is in it, too.

01:11:17.232 --> 01:11:18.799
He plays the tutor.

01:11:20.901 --> 01:11:22.237
We're still talking
about Jack, right?

01:11:22.271 --> 01:11:23.472
Yeah.

01:11:23.505 --> 01:11:26.241
Huh, okay.
