00:45.927 --> 00:48.323
I'm not sure about this,
peregrine.

00:48.527 --> 00:52.214
It's a lovely night.
It would be a shame to ruin it.

00:53.300 --> 00:54.860
You told me you wanted
to come out here.

00:54.902 --> 00:57.073
- I did.
- But now you want to leave,

00:57.331 --> 00:59.034
and we have hardly
gotten settled.

00:59.113 --> 01:02.890
- Please, can we just go home?
- After a kiss.

01:06.159 --> 01:09.698
See? It's not so bad, is it?

01:10.433 --> 01:12.144
- Something's moving.
- Just the earth.

01:12.253 --> 01:14.816
Please, I would
like you to stop.

01:16.495 --> 01:18.180
What do you want?

01:18.340 --> 01:20.777
Aaaaah!

01:21.167 --> 01:23.042
Don't!

01:25.441 --> 01:26.597
You there!

01:26.691 --> 01:29.558
- Get away from her!
- Aaaaaah!

01:39.097 --> 01:41.386
- Are you alright?
- Yes.

01:41.597 --> 01:43.636
My God! That was the lurker!

01:43.800 --> 01:46.144
Do you think
he might be coming back?

01:50.479 --> 01:52.479
And he was wearing shaded spectacles?

01:52.573 --> 01:53.754
To shield his eyes.

01:53.831 --> 01:55.917
They were so unusual...
But you said

01:55.942 --> 01:57.941
it happened at night.
Why would he wear

01:57.980 --> 01:59.617
- shaded spectacles at night?
- Suffering from

01:59.641 --> 02:02.277
some insidious disease,
I'd imagine.

02:02.448 --> 02:04.010
He was snarling
like some kind of animal.

02:04.034 --> 02:06.277
And he compromised
this young lady's honour!

02:06.347 --> 02:08.066
Well, I'm not so sure
about that.

02:08.104 --> 02:12.495
- He did. I was there.
- Where does he live?

02:12.745 --> 02:16.527
Huh... if we knew that,
we'd have arrested him by now.

02:16.964 --> 02:18.480
Are you certain it was him?

02:18.503 --> 02:20.060
The lurker hasn't
been seen in weeks.

02:20.095 --> 02:24.089
- Of course we're certain.
- Yes, it was the lurker.

02:24.323 --> 02:28.113
- Has he accosted many women?
- There have been

02:28.394 --> 02:31.784
a few incidents.
- Is he always so... amorous?

02:32.027 --> 02:33.620
Well, that's hard to say.

02:33.745 --> 02:36.839
Usually he just swans
about thieving.

02:36.956 --> 02:39.097
This was no mere swanning about.

02:39.238 --> 02:41.948
He attacked us and we demand
his apprehension.

02:42.113 --> 02:43.628
And we will do
all that we can...

02:43.683 --> 02:46.152
What the devil is that, George?

02:46.308 --> 02:48.659
The inspector gets back today.
I had it made specially.

02:48.745 --> 02:51.714
A football pitch?
It is a cake

02:51.816 --> 02:53.540
befitting a champion.

02:53.642 --> 02:55.485
You will, I hope,
begin looking for the lurker

02:55.538 --> 02:59.220
once you've had your tea?
- I told you I would, sir.

02:59.316 --> 03:01.118
- The lurker's back?
- Apparently.

03:01.235 --> 03:04.126
- But he has caused no real harm.
- No real harm?

03:04.267 --> 03:06.337
He insulted
this young lady's honour!

03:06.454 --> 03:08.764
- Well...
- It wasn't that bad.

03:11.923 --> 03:15.095
Just do something about it!

03:15.798 --> 03:17.634
So the lurker
has made his return.

03:17.746 --> 03:20.267
It appears so. The new report
matches the old ones.

03:20.366 --> 03:23.548
Distinctive hat, long dark cape,
shaded spectacles.

03:23.657 --> 03:26.782
- An unusual choice of attire.
- Sir, they also said

03:26.870 --> 03:30.079
he snarled like an animal.
- I'm sure that's just

03:30.157 --> 03:32.696
a fanciful addition.
Two witnesses both claim

03:32.777 --> 03:37.661
it's true.
- First report in three weeks?

03:37.879 --> 03:39.043
Let's hope this isn't the start

03:39.067 --> 03:41.403
of another series
of nightly incidents.

03:41.510 --> 03:43.622
Please give me all
the information we have on him.

03:43.739 --> 03:46.708
Sir.
The inspector's coming!

03:48.223 --> 03:50.239
Yes!

03:51.848 --> 03:53.989
Thanks, lads.
Thank you, thank you.

03:54.145 --> 03:58.551
Congratulations, sir!
A champion in our midst, lads!

04:00.436 --> 04:02.286
Well, the yanks gave us
all we could handle

04:02.324 --> 04:04.162
but the galt lads gave it back.

04:04.229 --> 04:06.231
- World champions, sir.
- Well, you can hardly

04:06.341 --> 04:09.294
be considered world champions
if england doesn't show up.

04:09.403 --> 04:12.106
But the gold medal
was well earned none the less.

04:12.286 --> 04:13.434
Sir, did you see

04:13.483 --> 04:15.848
the Louisiana purchase
exposition by chance?

04:15.981 --> 04:19.426
They call it the world's fair,
Murdoch. And it was glorious.

04:19.575 --> 04:20.879
All the wonders of the world
were there.

04:20.903 --> 04:22.997
1500 buildings and exhibitions.

04:23.083 --> 04:25.887
200000 people a day.
You've never seen such a crowd!

04:26.098 --> 04:29.255
They reenacted a battle
from the Boer War twice a day.

04:29.380 --> 04:32.161
- I saw a pygmy.
- A pygmy, sir?

04:32.286 --> 04:34.262
Little chap from Africa.

04:34.411 --> 04:35.801
Didn't care much
for the way he treated him,

04:35.825 --> 04:37.942
so I set him free.
- You set him free?

04:38.059 --> 04:39.499
Well, he was out
for a couple of days

04:39.528 --> 04:43.512
before he was apprehended... but it seemed
he had a jolly good time while he was out.

04:43.809 --> 04:45.832
Learned something scientific
there as well, Murdoch.

04:45.856 --> 04:48.481
- Oh you did, sir?
- An apple a day

04:48.590 --> 04:50.911
keeps the doctor away.
You ever hear that?

04:51.114 --> 04:53.458
No. No, I haven't.

04:53.739 --> 04:56.997
Though it seems sound advice.
The apple is a rich source of...

04:57.098 --> 04:58.747
Yes, yes.
No need to go on, Murdoch.

04:58.840 --> 05:02.442
- I'm prepared to accept it as fact.
- Good lord!

05:02.510 --> 05:04.497
You go to an event
like the world's fair

05:04.583 --> 05:07.419
and you realize that the world
is a marvelous bloody place.

05:07.684 --> 05:09.309
My life's half over,
and I've barely even

05:09.349 --> 05:11.622
scratched the surface.
- Sir,

05:11.718 --> 05:14.887
did you see Thomas Edison's
steel-nickel battery by chance?

05:14.912 --> 05:17.090
Apparently it's set
to revolutionize the way

05:17.123 --> 05:20.071
that power is harnessed...
- Shame! I missed that one.

05:20.767 --> 05:23.492
Oh! Oh, well.

05:23.876 --> 05:25.923
Well, I suppose
we should get back to it.

05:26.103 --> 05:28.532
So, what's been going on
around here?

05:28.642 --> 05:30.727
It seems the lurker
has resurfaced.

05:30.842 --> 05:32.942
- The lurker?
- Yes.

05:33.158 --> 05:35.079
The incidents
began a few weeks ago,

05:35.166 --> 05:38.548
shortly before you left for St. Louis.
- What's he do? Just lurk?

05:38.704 --> 05:41.048
Petty theft,
destruction of property...

05:41.099 --> 05:43.431
- The tempting of women...
- It that all?

05:43.493 --> 05:45.602
Do you think we're wasting time on
a good luck Charlie?

05:45.626 --> 05:48.665
Well, sir, as with any criminal,
the severity of his crimes

05:48.758 --> 05:52.613
could increase... at any rate.

05:52.910 --> 05:55.863
- It's good to have you back.
- Put the kettle on, Crabtree.

05:55.937 --> 05:57.488
Sir.

06:07.759 --> 06:09.251
Constable Crabtree!

06:09.421 --> 06:12.056
I hear the lurker is back.

06:12.260 --> 06:15.039
- I keep my ear to the ground.
- You'd think a police force

06:15.089 --> 06:17.259
should be able
to track down a lunatic.

06:17.368 --> 06:19.829
Well, one could say the same
about a clever journalist,

06:19.986 --> 06:23.392
Miss Cherry.
So you'll admit I'm clever?

06:23.579 --> 06:25.157
If you hear of anything,
constable,

06:25.204 --> 06:27.266
my readers would love to know.

06:27.392 --> 06:29.103
I'll certainly keep you in mind.

06:29.204 --> 06:31.790
I surely hope you do.

06:43.861 --> 06:47.753
<i>And the gold medal
is awarded to Canada!</i>

06:56.056 --> 06:59.865
<i>Welcome to the 1904 world fair!</i>

06:59.954 --> 07:01.611
<i>The world's
the wildest bloody place.</i>

07:01.689 --> 07:04.236
<i>I saw a pigmy,
a little chap from Africa.</i>

07:11.884 --> 07:14.978
<i>My life's half over and I've
barely scratched the surface.</i>

07:22.439 --> 07:24.517
He doesn't like to lurk far.

07:24.626 --> 07:26.290
All of the incidents
have occurred

07:26.377 --> 07:29.048
in this small area
east of yonge street.

07:32.361 --> 07:33.986
Every available constable
should be

07:34.101 --> 07:37.025
patrolling these streets.
And be sure...

07:41.087 --> 07:44.040
Sure that everyone
has his description.

07:44.275 --> 07:45.650
Excuse me.

07:45.704 --> 07:47.290
In their hands.

07:49.814 --> 07:53.220
- Stop it! Stop it!
- Sir?

07:54.345 --> 07:57.423
- James Pendrick!
- Murdoch.

07:57.572 --> 07:58.720
What's so amusing?

07:58.798 --> 08:00.760
- Nothing.
- Nothing.

08:01.587 --> 08:03.430
- What are you doing here?
- I just popped in to see

08:03.454 --> 08:06.079
my old friend Tommy two cakes.
- I told you about that...

08:06.111 --> 08:09.632
- You like the name fine enough.
- I ran into James at the world's fair.

08:09.657 --> 08:11.860
- He showed me around.
- Not as much as you did me.

08:11.954 --> 08:14.657
Your inspector is a man
of great appetite.

08:14.836 --> 08:16.709
I see.
You're no slouch yourself.

08:16.744 --> 08:18.555
Thank you, Tom.
But there is something...

08:18.649 --> 08:21.344
- Do you have my swords?
- Swords?

08:21.461 --> 08:23.528
Yes, I had Tom bring back
a pair of antique

08:23.618 --> 08:25.805
Japanese katana swords
from St. Louis.

08:25.891 --> 08:29.501
Ah, yes. The weapons used by the
Samurai during the Muromachi period.

08:29.555 --> 08:33.321
- Oh yes, very good, Murdoch.
- Do you have them?

08:33.477 --> 08:35.554
They're at home.
I'll bring them in Tomorrow.

08:35.751 --> 08:37.133
Right then James,
it's six o'clock.

08:37.179 --> 08:39.399
- You know what that means?
- I certainly do.

08:39.571 --> 08:42.015
- Time for the Pub!
- Only a few, Tom.

08:42.078 --> 08:44.493
- I've a busy night tonight.
- Never more than a few, James.

08:44.586 --> 08:46.352
I've heard that one before.

08:46.485 --> 08:49.883
Oh, Murdoch,
would you care to join us?

08:50.821 --> 08:51.907
Oh!

08:51.932 --> 08:54.243
I really should...

08:56.586 --> 08:57.977
Why not?

09:00.360 --> 09:02.354
I just wish
I had time to see everything

09:02.389 --> 09:03.789
the fair had to offer.
- You might have,

09:03.813 --> 09:06.243
had you not spent so much time
on Mr. Ferris' wheel.

09:06.305 --> 09:08.360
- It was like flying.
- Man's achievements,

09:08.395 --> 09:09.969
when gathered together,
are an impressive sight.

09:09.993 --> 09:11.360
You can say that again, James.

09:11.438 --> 09:12.798
Those Egyptians were
a clever bunch.

09:12.822 --> 09:16.086
- I never knew that about them.
- We flew.

09:16.274 --> 09:19.329
- I'm sorry, Murdoch?
- We flew over the falls.

09:19.454 --> 09:20.797
- That was something.

09:20.915 --> 09:23.055
Yes. Yes, of course.

09:23.188 --> 09:25.108
But you know what is interesting,
Thomas, is that,

09:25.132 --> 09:27.529
Egyptians aside,
the most impressive achievements

09:27.583 --> 09:30.248
on view at the fair have come
into being in the last ten years.

09:30.365 --> 09:33.719
- We are in the age of invention, James.
- Indeed we are. Another?

09:33.771 --> 09:36.369
Yes. Just call me
Ten Tankard Tommy.

09:36.533 --> 09:39.992
Ten Tankard Tommy.

09:49.775 --> 09:51.916
Is there something
troubling you, William?

09:52.158 --> 09:53.405
No.

09:54.150 --> 09:57.377
I heard James Pendrick
dropped by the station today.

09:57.565 --> 09:58.565
He did.

09:58.604 --> 10:00.412
You should have
brought him home.

10:00.502 --> 10:03.382
Oh, I think he's out
with the inspector.

10:03.994 --> 10:05.651
- The inspector?
- Hmm.

10:06.236 --> 10:08.072
The two of them have seemed
to have struck up a friendship

10:08.096 --> 10:10.422
since spending time together
in St. Louis

10:10.486 --> 10:14.960
at the world's fair.
- That's what's troubling you?

10:25.713 --> 10:27.385
And apparently,
he shields his eyes

10:27.471 --> 10:29.611
with shaded spectacles.
Well, I would think he could be

10:29.635 --> 10:32.089
a revenant, but he seems more
intent on locking lips with women

10:32.113 --> 10:34.611
than any real violence.
- Sounds to me

10:34.727 --> 10:37.236
like this lurker is just
looking for a good time.

10:37.416 --> 10:40.088
Nina, he's a monster
straight out of Stevenson.

10:40.166 --> 10:41.736
Just because a man
has lust in his heart

10:41.776 --> 10:45.236
doesn't make him evil, George.
Everyone has two sides to them.

10:45.471 --> 10:47.416
Look around.
These men have their vices

10:47.471 --> 10:49.705
but it doesn't mean
they don't lead good lives.

10:50.002 --> 10:52.119
And I suppose I have
to count myself among them.

10:52.268 --> 10:55.361
- But some men don't have a dark side.
- And I think that's admirable.

10:55.479 --> 10:58.437
It's what we should
at least be striving for.

10:58.744 --> 11:01.447
- I certainly hope not.
- Why's that?

11:01.705 --> 11:04.518
If people strove for that,
where would my business be?

11:04.650 --> 11:07.704
Oh! You won't believe what happened!
The lurker attacked me

11:07.729 --> 11:09.103
on my way to the club.
- The lurker?

11:09.127 --> 11:12.109
It surely was. He's not
lurking anymore. Though.

11:12.172 --> 11:13.919
After I stabbed him
with my hatpin,

11:13.946 --> 11:18.031
he just ran away.
I said he ran away!

11:18.203 --> 11:20.692
- He's long gone by now.
- I hope you can catch him

11:20.766 --> 11:23.562
quickly before he does
something serious.

11:35.807 --> 11:37.430
Hello?

11:43.607 --> 11:45.539
Hello?

12:03.077 --> 12:05.410
Thomas! Ah!

12:08.016 --> 12:11.164
Thomas, why are you sleeping
down here again?

12:17.211 --> 12:18.589
Bloody old bugger!

12:18.664 --> 12:20.555
You there!

12:22.811 --> 12:25.100
- Thomas! Thomas!
- It's all right.

12:25.181 --> 12:27.536
It's all right.
He's gone. He's gone.

12:27.650 --> 12:30.624
He's gone. It's okay.

12:31.677 --> 12:33.131
It's all right.

12:33.340 --> 12:35.520
Miss Hall said
she fended him off with a hatpin

12:35.606 --> 12:38.481
so he can't be any real threat.
- The man's a bloody menace.

12:38.591 --> 12:39.927
Sir?
Last night.

12:40.091 --> 12:41.989
In my home. The lurker.
- No!

12:42.052 --> 12:44.276
Yes. He broke into
my own bloody house.

12:44.348 --> 12:46.778
Scared Margaret half to death.
- Sir, are you quite sure

12:46.872 --> 12:48.973
it was the lurker?
Of course it was the lurker.

12:49.052 --> 12:51.716
I saw him with my own eyes.
- What did he look like?

12:51.880 --> 12:53.785
Like a damned beast!
- A beast, sir?

12:53.895 --> 12:55.927
Like an animal?
Or a man possessed?

12:56.067 --> 12:58.867
Or a creature bearing no resemblance
to any earthly species whatsoever?

12:58.910 --> 13:00.769
I don't know, Crabtree.
I didn't see his face.

13:00.810 --> 13:03.762
But he sounded like
a slavering monster.

13:06.583 --> 13:10.005
- Sir, are you sure about this?
- Constable Crabtree.

13:10.380 --> 13:11.817
Sausages?

13:17.278 --> 13:19.411
Gerard waldkirch, known by all

13:19.489 --> 13:21.919
as the sausage king.
A popular chap.

13:22.036 --> 13:23.915
Well, they did name him king.

13:24.200 --> 13:26.387
Cause of death
was a very deep knife wound.

13:26.536 --> 13:30.083
- Thin blade.
- Did anyone see the incident?

13:30.192 --> 13:32.257
Two witnesses, sir.
Neither could give

13:32.292 --> 13:34.426
much of a description,
but it was the lurker.

13:35.083 --> 13:36.561
- Why say that?
- Sir,

13:36.921 --> 13:39.030
they described seeing a man
cloaked in darkness

13:39.132 --> 13:41.530
who snarled like an animal.

13:44.140 --> 13:46.218
Well... you know
what this means, George.

13:46.343 --> 13:49.808
Yes, sir. The lurker
has moved up to murder.

13:54.741 --> 13:58.022
And shop keepers.
The victim was known to all,

13:58.147 --> 14:01.593
yet no one emerged as a suspect.
- The man had a busy night.

14:01.694 --> 14:03.733
A murder, the star room,
and he broke into

14:03.796 --> 14:05.790
my own bloody house.
- All we know

14:05.825 --> 14:09.226
is that the incidents continue
to occur in a concentrated area.

14:09.351 --> 14:12.085
I'll talk to station house 3
and get more constables.

14:12.226 --> 14:14.124
He was about to attack
my wife, Murdoch.

14:14.202 --> 14:15.913
We're catching him tonight.

14:20.554 --> 14:21.882
Mr. Pendrick?

14:21.991 --> 14:23.296
- Gentlemen.
- James!

14:23.358 --> 14:24.646
- What are you doing here?
- It's about

14:24.670 --> 14:27.101
this unfortunate murder,
I'm afraid. There's somebody

14:27.152 --> 14:30.718
I'd like you to meet.
- This is Ashmi, my assistant.

14:30.851 --> 14:33.952
A woman?
Always a woman, Tom.

14:34.093 --> 14:35.741
Ashmi saw the sausage king

14:35.804 --> 14:38.241
only yesterday,
in my laboratory.

14:38.515 --> 14:40.624
What was he doing
in your laboratory?

14:40.749 --> 14:42.827
I hate being interrupted
by time-wasting meals.

14:42.937 --> 14:44.780
Ashmi has our lunches
brought in.

14:44.905 --> 14:47.663
The sausage king delivers them
directly to us.

14:48.233 --> 14:50.301
I see.
Did he do

14:50.336 --> 14:52.538
or say anything of interest?

14:52.671 --> 14:56.694
Only this. That someone
had recently damaged his cart.

14:56.796 --> 15:01.468
- Vandalism?
- He said a man was "out to get him."

15:01.757 --> 15:04.483
He was murdered on parliament street.
Were either of you in that area

15:04.546 --> 15:07.118
late last night?
- In a sense.

15:07.153 --> 15:09.530
We were in the laboratory,
working till dawn.

15:09.647 --> 15:11.866
Do you often work
through the night?

15:11.983 --> 15:15.577
We are conducting a series
of highly technical experiments.

15:15.709 --> 15:18.819
I take copious notes
on everything.

15:18.929 --> 15:20.131
The way you are looking at me

15:20.202 --> 15:23.140
is both flattering
and uncomfortable.

15:25.624 --> 15:28.257
- Now, Tom.
- I'll need those swords.

15:28.444 --> 15:30.608
Oh! Bollocks, I forgot.

15:30.804 --> 15:32.796
We should go to my house.

15:35.382 --> 15:39.054
You keep the katana swords
in an unsecured location?

15:39.265 --> 15:40.985
This is a police
officer's abode.

15:41.020 --> 15:42.987
It's as secure
as a pharaoh's Tomb.

15:43.116 --> 15:48.140
Oh. I see.
Having said that...

15:48.421 --> 15:49.585
The bloody lurker.

15:49.687 --> 15:53.304
- They've gone.
- What do you mean, gone?

15:53.397 --> 15:55.166
Tom, those swords
were important!

15:55.241 --> 15:56.959
Then you should have told me
they were. Besides,

15:56.983 --> 15:59.563
they weren't the only things that were
stolen. They were the only things

15:59.587 --> 16:03.897
of mine that were stolen. They're were only a
couple of bloody old swords. And replicas,

16:03.976 --> 16:06.069
if I remember correctly.
- It's not the swords

16:06.108 --> 16:09.115
I'm concerned about.
It's what was in the case.

16:10.093 --> 16:12.679
Was I smuggling
something for you?

16:13.819 --> 16:15.991
Well, not exactly smuggling, no.

16:16.085 --> 16:18.937
Then what, exactly,
was I doing for you?

16:20.554 --> 16:21.765
Well, yes, it was a form

16:21.819 --> 16:24.265
of smuggling, all right.
- I'm a police officer!

16:24.322 --> 16:26.577
Bloody hell!
Always with the "bloody hell"!

16:26.602 --> 16:28.452
You're a better man than that.

16:28.616 --> 16:30.289
And it was the fact
that you're a police officer

16:30.313 --> 16:32.741
that I felt
it was safe with you.

16:34.179 --> 16:36.304
It? What it?

16:37.515 --> 16:40.952
A container of an herb
called Guarana.

16:41.163 --> 16:43.820
But not ordinary Guarana.

16:44.132 --> 16:46.483
Well, that clears things up.
Ordinary Guarana is found

16:46.537 --> 16:49.249
throughout south America.
This particular strain

16:49.335 --> 16:51.765
is only found
in the lowlands of Panama.

16:51.858 --> 16:53.757
Nearly unobtainable.

16:53.960 --> 16:57.093
Whoever stole it knew exactly
what he was after.

16:57.280 --> 17:00.460
And he may have followed us
from St. Louis.

17:00.702 --> 17:02.671
What's so special about it?

17:03.835 --> 17:06.460
Do you want the short answer
or the long one?

17:07.046 --> 17:08.965
- I think we should get Murdoch
involved in this.

17:09.093 --> 17:10.280
You're probably right.

17:10.374 --> 17:12.780
Gentlemen,
welcome to my new laboratory.

17:12.851 --> 17:16.015
As you can see I have a team
of people helping my pursuits.

17:16.132 --> 17:18.499
Ashmi, of course,
helps me with my research.

17:18.585 --> 17:21.290
This is my lab man,
he keeps the place tip-top.

17:21.396 --> 17:23.132
The man at the piano there
is an expert

17:23.185 --> 17:24.976
in mechanical engineering.
He says music

17:25.041 --> 17:28.515
is the food of thought
or some nonsense.

17:28.718 --> 17:30.944
Anyway, he's terribly good,
so I'm hardly complaining.

17:31.020 --> 17:35.499
This is Dr. Karlsson.
Physicist. Swedish.

17:37.175 --> 17:39.483
Have you ever had
a Swedish massage, Tom?

17:39.562 --> 17:42.478
No.
Anytime you like, inspector.

17:42.687 --> 17:44.944
Well, I've been feeling
a little bit pinched...

17:45.101 --> 17:48.937
Can we get to the point...
Ah, thank the lord!

17:49.069 --> 17:53.065
I am famished. A new dish
for you tonight, Mr. Pendrick.

17:53.127 --> 17:54.651
Nice to have your business again.

17:54.676 --> 17:57.104
Yes. Well, with the demise
of the king...

17:57.161 --> 18:02.190
Now, Murdoch, are you familiar
with the herb Guarana?

18:02.455 --> 18:04.479
- No, I'm not.
- Good lord.

18:04.525 --> 18:07.729
That's a first. Guarana is an
herb that has been known to help

18:07.775 --> 18:10.697
the addled mind focus.
It is readily available.

18:10.791 --> 18:12.947
If so, why steal it from you?

18:13.119 --> 18:14.987
The particular strain
I'm interested in

18:15.079 --> 18:18.158
has demonstrated remarkable qualities.
It is a super Guarana.

18:18.260 --> 18:20.518
Found only in the swamplands
of Panama.

18:20.658 --> 18:23.152
I arranged to purchase
a small quantity of it,

18:23.338 --> 18:25.690
but I was not
the only interested party.

18:25.862 --> 18:28.705
And my competitors would do
anything to take it from me.

18:28.901 --> 18:30.626
That's why you arranged

18:30.697 --> 18:32.260
for the inspector
to transport it here.

18:32.354 --> 18:34.635
An action for which
I have already apologized.

18:34.885 --> 18:37.627
Now, Murdoch, it is imperative
that you apprehend this lurker

18:37.697 --> 18:40.307
of yours and return the Guarana
to its rightful owner.

18:40.463 --> 18:42.565
Why's it so important to you?

18:43.260 --> 18:45.213
In combination
with a formulation

18:45.268 --> 18:48.119
that I have created,
I believe I can exponentially

18:48.179 --> 18:51.135
expand a human being's
intellectual capacity.

18:51.338 --> 18:53.838
- You can make a bloke smarter.
- Exactly.

18:53.994 --> 18:57.049
What's the formulation?
It is a carefully-calibrated

18:57.088 --> 18:59.721
concoction of khat,
ephedra sinica,

18:59.799 --> 19:02.940
phenyl-isopropylamine and
a number of other substances.

19:03.096 --> 19:06.095
I call it "jumper."
- Is this a helicopter?

19:06.244 --> 19:08.526
- A hovering platform?
- Yes.

19:08.565 --> 19:10.885
I have hundreds more.
None of them finished.

19:11.010 --> 19:13.846
One of the unfortunate
side effects of my jumper

19:13.987 --> 19:16.987
is that my mind tends
to dart from place...

19:17.072 --> 19:20.549
An automated Pancake maker?

19:20.729 --> 19:22.752
Not one of my finest hours.
Needless to say

19:22.814 --> 19:24.916
all my other ideas
are brilliant.

19:25.088 --> 19:27.151
But sadly, they are incomplete.

19:27.283 --> 19:29.618
And you need the Guarana
to make them complete?

19:29.654 --> 19:33.455
Very good, Tom.
My formulation expands the mind,

19:33.565 --> 19:37.494
the Guarana helps focus it.
- What's in your formulation?

19:37.729 --> 19:41.737
Always the skeptic.
Merely curious is all.

19:47.377 --> 19:50.791
Oh no! Oh, dear God, no!

19:50.987 --> 19:53.830
It's gone! Ashmi!

19:53.979 --> 19:55.377
- Yes, Mr. Pendrick?
- Where is it?

19:55.409 --> 19:58.377
- Who's been in my safe?
- No one. No one but you.

19:58.596 --> 20:00.424
It was sitting here open
when I got here

20:00.518 --> 20:02.908
and I was not
the one to open it.

20:05.651 --> 20:07.627
Tom, Murdoch...

20:07.737 --> 20:10.010
You have to find them.

20:10.197 --> 20:11.799
If my formulation
and the Guarana

20:11.856 --> 20:14.440
fall into the wrong hands...
Whoever stole them could become

20:14.517 --> 20:17.532
the most dangerous maniac
the world has ever seen!

20:17.830 --> 20:19.502
<i>The "most dangerous maniac"</i>

20:19.635 --> 20:21.471
may be a bit
of an overstatement.

20:21.627 --> 20:23.557
Be that as it may,
do you think he's right?

20:23.666 --> 20:25.519
That our killer and his thief
are one and the same?

20:25.543 --> 20:27.510
It's possible.
- We have to assume

20:27.545 --> 20:29.197
whoever stole the swords
from your home

20:29.281 --> 20:30.994
also broke
into Mr. Pendrick's lab.

20:31.072 --> 20:33.822
- So it was the lurker.
- Witnesses believe the lurker

20:33.893 --> 20:37.190
and the killer are one and the same.
- My question is,

20:37.354 --> 20:39.815
what's the connection
between Mr. Pendrick's research

20:39.901 --> 20:43.080
and the sausage vendor?
- Maybe he witnessed the robbery.

20:43.190 --> 20:45.455
Or maybe the killer
just didn't like him.

20:45.557 --> 20:48.408
Or maybe the lurker's just
some complete bloody madman.

20:48.549 --> 20:50.885
Well, there is one factor
from which we can work.

20:51.010 --> 20:53.735
The thief had to have knowledge
of Mr. Pendrick's experiments.

20:53.822 --> 20:56.138
- One of his assistants.
- We'll send George down there

20:56.173 --> 20:58.377
to make a list of everyone
who's set foot in that building

20:58.401 --> 21:00.309
in the past few weeks.
If any of them

21:00.344 --> 21:03.705
has a connection to the victim,
I believe we'll have our lurker.

21:09.338 --> 21:12.321
- Tissue.
- He fought back.

21:12.348 --> 21:14.729
Our attacker
should be bearing wounds.

21:14.859 --> 21:17.268
Mr. Waldkirch's injuries
are quite minor.

21:17.462 --> 21:19.244
Save the knife blade
through his heart.

21:19.354 --> 21:22.164
Of course.
So it was a knife, then?

21:22.479 --> 21:24.822
It appears so.

21:25.815 --> 21:28.627
Could it have been a sword?

21:28.940 --> 21:30.369
Miss James?

21:30.651 --> 21:33.542
- I'd say it's possible.
- Hmm.

21:47.041 --> 21:49.612
- And is he a murderer now?
- That seems to be the case.

21:49.721 --> 21:51.697
Good lord!
He attacked Lydia.

21:51.776 --> 21:53.846
She was able to fend him off...

21:54.018 --> 21:56.362
This time. And that doesn't
let the police off the hook.

21:58.184 --> 22:01.285
- Don't worry, we'll catch him.
- I hope so.

22:07.424 --> 22:09.518
Aaaaah! It's the lurker!

22:10.432 --> 22:12.658
Hoi! You stop there!

22:19.112 --> 22:21.474
James Pendrick?

22:24.552 --> 22:27.713
That's harassment, murder.

22:27.947 --> 22:32.088
And to think we had the lurker
right under our noses the entire time.

22:33.932 --> 22:37.264
Do not sit down!
How could you hide this from us?

22:37.322 --> 22:41.471
And break into my own bloody house.
- You don't understand.

22:41.604 --> 22:45.307
The man you arrested last night,
that... that wasn't me.

22:45.479 --> 22:47.455
It wasn't you?

22:47.666 --> 22:51.916
The truth is that my formulation
produces side effects.

22:52.127 --> 22:54.782
After the jumpers wear off,
I fall into a deep sleep.

22:54.869 --> 22:58.713
At that point, I apparently
lose all control over myself.

22:58.877 --> 23:00.988
And I have no idea
it's happening.

23:01.229 --> 23:04.692
- You don't remember a thing?
- Not a moment of it.

23:04.869 --> 23:06.794
You're claiming you had no idea

23:06.862 --> 23:09.330
that you were the lurker
until you awoke in our cells

23:09.370 --> 23:12.666
today?
- Well...

23:12.908 --> 23:14.924
The notion had crossed my mind.

23:15.106 --> 23:18.971
- You never said anything.
- I wasn't sure!

23:19.182 --> 23:22.721
Believe me,
I'm as confused as anyone.

23:22.963 --> 23:25.612
From time to time,
I would awake with bruises,

23:25.744 --> 23:27.982
surrounded by items

23:28.229 --> 23:29.822
I had supposedly stolen.

23:29.963 --> 23:32.520
- Yet you kept taking the drug.
- It's clear

23:32.555 --> 23:35.823
I've misbehaved. And it's clear
I have much work to do

23:35.858 --> 23:37.890
on my formulation before
it's safe for consumption.

23:37.976 --> 23:41.395
But none of this
makes me your killer.

23:41.577 --> 23:43.155
When you were apprehended
last night,

23:43.204 --> 23:47.124
your behaviour and your attire
matched the witnesses' description.

23:47.319 --> 23:49.837
Yes, but why
would I steal from myself?

23:49.872 --> 23:52.968
The Guarana, my formulation,
somebody took it.

23:53.022 --> 23:55.522
Whoever stole it
could have imbibed it.

23:55.788 --> 23:58.124
Or there is no thief.

23:58.327 --> 23:59.580
Right.

23:59.615 --> 24:00.944
What motive
would an international

24:00.976 --> 24:03.507
pharmaceutical thief
have to murder a sausage vendor?

24:03.671 --> 24:06.515
- What motivation would I have?
- I don't know.

24:06.694 --> 24:08.389
But you knew him
and you lied to us!

24:08.424 --> 24:10.804
I've been entirely truthful.
No, you haven't.

24:11.022 --> 24:12.726
You lied to us just now.

24:12.897 --> 24:14.585
You say your formulation
was stolen,

24:14.645 --> 24:16.999
yet you had a dose last night.
- No.

24:17.187 --> 24:19.038
It was stolen.

24:20.062 --> 24:23.390
I keep a vial in reserve.

24:23.882 --> 24:26.307
I suppose you should keep it.

24:31.241 --> 24:33.765
Mr. Pendrick,
may I see your right hand?

24:36.741 --> 24:39.124
Appears I've been pricked
by something.

24:39.491 --> 24:41.702
A hatpin, perhaps.

24:42.062 --> 24:44.425
Please remove your shirt.

24:47.905 --> 24:49.163
Here?

24:49.296 --> 24:51.319
There were no scratches
on him. There you have it.

24:51.452 --> 24:53.167
There could be
another explanation

24:53.202 --> 24:55.272
for the tissue under
the victim's fingernails.

24:55.374 --> 24:58.054
But sir, we know Pendrick
is the lurker.

24:58.187 --> 24:59.835
He could very well be
the killer.

24:59.944 --> 25:02.610
- How can you be so sure?
- Although we didn't know it

25:02.645 --> 25:04.507
at the time,
he offered us an alibi

25:04.553 --> 25:06.929
for the night of the murder.
- That's right.

25:07.140 --> 25:09.038
His assistant said he was
in his lab all night.

25:09.085 --> 25:11.118
- Which we know was a lie.
- Do we?

25:11.153 --> 25:13.366
Yes, sir.
He was stabbed with a hatpin

25:13.421 --> 25:15.489
outside the Burlesque
that very night.

25:17.991 --> 25:21.128
I was not completely truthful
in my earlier statement.

25:21.249 --> 25:23.577
Did you see Mr. Pendrick
leave the laboratory last night?

25:23.772 --> 25:26.937
No. I went home to sleep
before midnight.

25:27.124 --> 25:29.413
I was gone for some hours.
When I came back,

25:29.444 --> 25:32.351
he was in the laboratory,
sound asleep.

25:32.483 --> 25:35.142
I assumed he hadn't left.
- But he could have.

25:35.593 --> 25:37.663
I was only trying
to protect James.

25:37.796 --> 25:39.813
The world will suffer
if his work

25:39.849 --> 25:41.849
is not allowed to continue.

25:43.632 --> 25:46.820
Please stay nearby in case
we have further questions.

25:50.569 --> 25:52.826
Any chance the murder weapon
could still be around,

25:52.862 --> 25:55.329
do you think?
- It wouldn't hurt to look.

25:55.364 --> 25:57.598
Oh, I don't know, Murdoch.

25:57.633 --> 25:59.960
It makes no sense that a man
would steal from himself.

26:00.069 --> 26:02.180
That means someone else could
have taken Pendrick's jumpers.

26:02.204 --> 26:03.983
And that person
could be the killer.

26:04.066 --> 26:06.033
Sir, our constables
are interviewing

26:06.060 --> 26:08.304
all of his employees.
If none of them

26:08.375 --> 26:09.398
have a connection to the victim,

26:09.422 --> 26:12.108
I'm afraid we are
without another suspect.

26:13.866 --> 26:15.482
This one's locked.

26:17.858 --> 26:20.921
- I could try to pick it...
- Forget that.

26:26.952 --> 26:29.452
Those are...
Pendrick's swords.

26:29.655 --> 26:32.311
He really did steal them
from himself.

26:33.303 --> 26:34.632
We should get them down
to the morgue.

26:34.656 --> 26:36.656
One of them could be
the murder weapon.

26:38.601 --> 26:40.124
George Crabtree!

26:40.241 --> 26:42.788
Just the man to give me
the latest on the lurker.

26:42.976 --> 26:45.061
Louise's latest on the lurker.
That's clever,

26:45.100 --> 26:47.741
I'll give you that. You could
make a daily column of it.

26:47.921 --> 26:50.257
Terrific idea. But then
I'd have to come down here

26:50.288 --> 26:52.586
every day to get the scoop.
Can you imagine,

26:52.621 --> 26:55.749
the two of us running into
one another every single day?

26:55.952 --> 26:59.259
Oh no, it would be
utterly miserable.

26:59.561 --> 27:01.788
Hello, George.
Ready for lunch?

27:01.825 --> 27:04.976
- Oh, Nina! Yes, of course.
- Hello! Louise cherry,

27:05.054 --> 27:07.201
<i>Toronto gazette.</i>
I'll leave you be.

27:07.236 --> 27:09.970
<i>Have...</i> constable.

27:10.210 --> 27:12.913
- A new friend, George?
- More of a nuisance,

27:12.968 --> 27:15.109
if anything. I mean,
all reporters are a bit

27:15.144 --> 27:16.828
of a nuisance,
but Louise in particular...

27:17.136 --> 27:19.258
Yet you call her
by her first name.

27:19.953 --> 27:22.133
I call my uncle Jerry
by his first name.

27:22.242 --> 27:24.367
That doesn't mean
he's not a royal pain.

27:33.555 --> 27:35.295
I must say, it's hard to believe

27:35.331 --> 27:37.297
after all these years
James Pendrick

27:37.322 --> 27:39.789
may really be a killer.
- There was no blood

27:39.891 --> 27:42.469
on the swords. But if one
of them matches the wound...

27:42.594 --> 27:45.414
You see, I feel like we've had
this conversation before.

27:45.610 --> 27:48.578
Every time his guilt
seems unassailable,

27:48.610 --> 27:51.586
it turns out
that he's actually innocent.

27:51.844 --> 27:55.360
Well, we know that Pendrick
is the lurker, that's a fact.

27:55.563 --> 27:56.917
And the only other explanation

27:56.952 --> 28:00.164
is that someone
followed him here

28:00.219 --> 28:03.039
from St. Louis,
stole his concoction,

28:03.117 --> 28:05.055
and killed a sausage vendor.

28:05.250 --> 28:08.344
- It does seem far-fetched.
- Dammit!

28:08.508 --> 28:10.086
Sir?
There's no point

28:10.149 --> 28:12.196
denying it any more.
The man's a killer.

28:12.352 --> 28:13.812
I thought I knew him
but I was blinded

28:13.836 --> 28:16.907
with his bloody charm.
- I will say, in my experience,

28:16.961 --> 28:18.438
no intoxicating substance

28:18.466 --> 28:20.499
can change a man's personality.

28:20.594 --> 28:23.719
It simply brings out
one's true colors more vividly.

28:23.805 --> 28:26.907
Then the lurker must be a bloody delight.
And a filthy liar.

28:27.000 --> 28:29.969
The lurker does display
much of James Pendrick's

28:30.078 --> 28:32.876
"carpe-diem" personality.
- Precisely.

28:32.955 --> 28:34.955
So the question is,
does James Pendrick

28:34.990 --> 28:37.900
truly have in his heart
the desire to kill a man?

28:38.056 --> 28:40.470
I don't think anyone knows
what's in this man's heart.

28:40.611 --> 28:42.884
One minute he's a friend
and the next

28:42.986 --> 28:44.494
he's attacking my wife.
- I wish

28:44.587 --> 28:47.400
I could be dissuaded, Julia.
But the evidence is damning

28:47.580 --> 28:50.697
and the alternative explanation
is preposterous.

28:50.806 --> 28:53.150
Yes. Well, gentlemen,

28:53.189 --> 28:54.775
are you ready
to hear my findings?

28:54.876 --> 28:56.908
- Go on then.
- This sword

28:56.947 --> 29:00.814
might be the murder weapon.
- Might be?

29:01.259 --> 29:03.728
I wish I could answer
more conclusively.

29:03.892 --> 29:05.900
But the attack
was made in a frenzy.

29:05.978 --> 29:07.290
The stab wounds are not clean,

29:07.314 --> 29:11.103
so I can't determine exactly
the width of the blade.

29:11.330 --> 29:13.431
If only Mr. Pendrick
had some memory

29:13.507 --> 29:17.943
of the night in question.
- Maybe he does.

29:21.933 --> 29:24.271
- What's this about, Tom?
- That's inspector

29:24.306 --> 29:26.136
to you, Pendrick.

29:27.167 --> 29:29.011
Found in your laboratory.

29:29.378 --> 29:32.042
I've been stealing from myself.

29:32.386 --> 29:36.315
- Where's the Guarana?
- Inside the flap.

29:36.940 --> 29:38.862
And what of my formulation?

29:39.167 --> 29:41.034
Have I been stealing that
as well?

29:41.206 --> 29:43.123
No sign of it.
Though I suspect

29:43.158 --> 29:45.081
you'll know where it is.
And you can tell us.

29:45.198 --> 29:47.269
Right after you tell us
you're the murderer.

29:47.349 --> 29:49.829
I can't confess to what
I don't recall.

29:50.008 --> 29:51.020
No.

29:51.317 --> 29:54.835
But if you don't remember,
maybe the lurker will.

30:00.286 --> 30:02.325
You want me to take my jumper?

30:02.520 --> 30:03.977
It may be a fruitless endeavour,

30:04.013 --> 30:06.645
but perhaps once you turn back
into the lurker,

30:06.731 --> 30:08.567
you will have
the lurker's memories.

30:08.716 --> 30:10.809
And then we can question you
about the murder.

30:10.872 --> 30:15.403
- And get your confession.
- All right.

30:15.724 --> 30:18.286
If I'm guilty,
then I deserve to be punished.

30:18.559 --> 30:20.231
One request...

30:20.504 --> 30:23.348
May I have a pencil and paper?

30:23.599 --> 30:25.778
This may be the last chance
I get to take my jumper

30:25.841 --> 30:28.763
and enjoy the hour of great
productivity it provide.

30:29.489 --> 30:32.161
It would be a shame to waste it.

30:41.555 --> 30:43.458
BotToms up.

30:46.309 --> 30:47.981
<i>When will the hanging be?</i>

30:48.169 --> 30:51.391
The man hasn't even been
brought before a judge yet, - sir.

30:51.427 --> 30:53.364
Well, then, when will he
be brought before a judge?

30:53.388 --> 30:56.196
As I said,
we are happy to testify.

30:56.622 --> 30:58.265
Is that him right there?

30:58.559 --> 31:00.801
Just... out in the open?

31:05.981 --> 31:07.934
How long has he been at it?

31:08.077 --> 31:10.403
We gave him the formulation
over an hour ago.

31:17.364 --> 31:18.911
It's remarkable.

31:19.067 --> 31:21.083
There's no doubting
his drug is powerful.

31:21.247 --> 31:22.997
How long do you think
he'll be out for?

31:23.114 --> 31:25.840
- I have no idea.
- Well,

31:25.910 --> 31:28.567
let me know when he wakes up.

31:34.285 --> 31:36.703
Julia...

31:39.965 --> 31:42.114
Oh. Hello.

31:42.192 --> 31:44.637
I'm sorry, it seems...

31:45.090 --> 31:46.680
Well, it seems

31:46.715 --> 31:49.887
that whatever was meant
to happen hasn't come to pass.

31:50.129 --> 31:52.386
Bollocks.
What do we do now?

31:52.421 --> 31:55.137
We wait. Julia!

32:00.457 --> 32:01.793
Pendrick!

32:02.676 --> 32:04.207
Mr. Pendrick,
we're trying to help you!

32:04.309 --> 32:06.333
Stop!

32:11.528 --> 32:13.540
Oh...

32:14.567 --> 32:17.856
James, stop this!
Give yourself up.

32:19.004 --> 32:21.332
I'm sorry, inspector.

32:21.449 --> 32:23.739
I believe I have
the right to remain...

32:23.910 --> 32:25.949
- Violent.
- Oooh!

32:26.910 --> 32:29.106
Aren't you lovely?

32:39.468 --> 32:42.335
Please, just wait here.

32:42.371 --> 32:44.246
I've had better.

32:52.614 --> 32:54.488
Get out of the bloody way!

32:57.239 --> 32:59.028
What have we done?

32:59.207 --> 33:01.456
Sir, we've let a murderer go free.

33:06.879 --> 33:09.182
Sir, any sign of Pendrick?

33:09.207 --> 33:10.297
He knows we're looking for him.

33:10.321 --> 33:12.288
Maybe he's already
fled the city.

33:12.348 --> 33:15.567
- We should search his laboratory.
- Jackson was there. No luck.

33:15.796 --> 33:18.434
He wouldn't risk getting caught
by going back to his lab.

33:18.574 --> 33:21.004
Sir, if Pendrick
is leaving town,

33:21.059 --> 33:23.371
he wouldn't leave
without all his research.

33:23.528 --> 33:26.356
Maybe you're right.

33:26.442 --> 33:28.981
Find out what that's about.
I'll handle the lab.

33:32.528 --> 33:33.647
Madam!

33:33.707 --> 33:35.614
- What is it?
- The lurker!

33:35.699 --> 33:37.762
It was the lurker!
Where did he go?

33:37.910 --> 33:39.176
Down the alley.

33:39.356 --> 33:42.663
Constable, take this woman's statement.

33:45.571 --> 33:47.571
Pendrick!

33:56.427 --> 33:58.637
Pendrick! Stop!

34:00.818 --> 34:03.263
Mr. Pendrick,
you're under arrest for murder.

34:08.699 --> 34:12.029
Mr. Pendrick. Nice to have
your business again.

34:15.568 --> 34:17.310
You killed the sausage vendor.

34:17.474 --> 34:18.943
Of course.

34:19.081 --> 34:21.560
Just as surely as I'll kill you.

34:25.911 --> 34:27.614
James Pendrick!

34:27.739 --> 34:31.337
- Give yourself up.
- Stay away.

34:40.318 --> 34:42.568
We don't have to do this, James.

34:42.880 --> 34:45.684
I'm not James Pendrick,
I'm the lurker!

35:41.547 --> 35:42.930
James...

35:43.055 --> 35:45.359
It's me, Tommy Two Cakes.

35:45.883 --> 35:47.279
Don't do this.
You're not a killer.

35:47.314 --> 35:49.581
Pendrick! Stop!

35:57.719 --> 35:59.117
Well done, sir.

35:59.289 --> 36:02.336
Are you all right?
Never in doubt, Murdoch.

36:02.476 --> 36:04.764
Well, sir, it would appear
that James Pendrick

36:04.844 --> 36:07.945
is not our killer.
- Maybe not.

36:08.195 --> 36:10.609
But he came bloody close.

36:16.203 --> 36:18.577
James Pendrick,
exonerated again.

36:18.766 --> 36:20.746
I'm rather surprised
he was given little more

36:20.781 --> 36:23.547
than a slap on the wrist, sir.
He didn't kill anybody.

36:23.641 --> 36:26.084
No, he didn't,
but he is responsible

36:26.109 --> 36:28.062
for several counts
of petty theft,

36:28.180 --> 36:30.456
harassment, groping...

36:30.578 --> 36:32.147
He even broke
into your house, sir.

36:32.172 --> 36:35.461
All in the name of science.
I thought you'd appreciate that.

36:35.750 --> 36:37.596
- Indeed.
- So.

36:38.039 --> 36:40.277
What happened to the international
thief who followed Pendrick

36:40.301 --> 36:43.008
from St. Louis?
There was no such man.

36:43.141 --> 36:46.805
So it was just some restaurant man
in a spat with a sausage vendor.

36:47.437 --> 36:50.367
Rather prosaic
when you put it that way.

36:50.687 --> 36:53.351
How did he even know about
Pendrick's bloody jumpers?

36:53.547 --> 36:56.125
Pendrick had been bragging
about them openly.

36:56.289 --> 36:58.350
I suppose the man thought
that they would help him

36:58.385 --> 37:00.812
to figure out how to win back
business that he'd lost

37:00.859 --> 37:04.797
to the sausage king.
- After all that,

37:05.156 --> 37:07.578
a man was killed
for having delicious sausages.

37:07.742 --> 37:09.383
Also prosaic.

37:09.453 --> 37:11.687
Well, the man's motives
may not have been inspiring,

37:11.734 --> 37:15.320
but we are left with quite a story
to write up in the reports, sir.

37:15.594 --> 37:18.504
- We've got a lot of paperwork to do?
- Yes.

37:24.141 --> 37:28.008
- Inspector Brackenreid.
- Ah, James!

37:30.546 --> 37:32.492
Of course.
We'll be right there.

37:32.571 --> 37:34.954
Murdoch, grab your hat.

37:35.126 --> 37:36.712
The combination
of my formulation

37:36.754 --> 37:39.298
and the Guarana
has produced remarkable results.

37:39.460 --> 37:41.110
Has it stopped the side effects?

37:41.227 --> 37:44.587
I don't know,
I haven't tried it. But my tests

37:44.632 --> 37:47.227
have revealed that something
far greater is at hand.

37:47.610 --> 37:50.634
Well, don't keep us waiting.
I took a small dose

37:50.665 --> 37:53.313
of my original formulation
and added the Guarana.

37:53.509 --> 37:55.751
But quite by accident,
I combined them in a petri dish

37:55.813 --> 37:58.274
that was home to a small family
of gastrotrichs.

37:58.415 --> 38:00.412
Tom, please, have a look.

38:04.079 --> 38:05.798
What are they? Worms?

38:05.970 --> 38:08.938
Gastrotrichs are organisms
that reside in the benthic zon...

38:09.048 --> 38:10.766
- So basically worms.
- Yes, sir.

38:10.884 --> 38:12.891
What they are is not important.

38:12.970 --> 38:15.845
Gastrotrichs ordinarily
live less than 72 hours.

38:15.962 --> 38:19.134
I gave these the formulation
a week ago.

38:19.657 --> 38:20.852
Impossible...

38:21.063 --> 38:23.493
They've already lived
twice their natural lifespan

38:23.618 --> 38:25.493
and they're as lively as ever.

38:25.688 --> 38:27.906
What, you think
you've found a way

38:27.942 --> 38:30.329
to forestall death?
- Yes, Tom,

38:30.516 --> 38:32.411
I believe I have.

38:33.212 --> 38:35.876
The proverbial fountain of youth

38:36.196 --> 38:37.915
is within my grasp.

38:53.782 --> 38:56.702
I have had a devil of a time
finding you, constable.

38:56.737 --> 38:59.509
Louise!
You promised me the scoop

38:59.587 --> 39:02.474
on the lurker.
That all's been over for days.

39:02.509 --> 39:04.876
The case is closed, it's already
made it to the papers.

39:04.930 --> 39:07.344
Yes, but I want the story
behind the story.

39:07.462 --> 39:10.071
To tell the tale of the men
who brought him to justice.

39:10.228 --> 39:13.251
I don't think anybody would be too
interested in that. That's why you're not

39:13.305 --> 39:16.212
the reporter.
I'll buy you dinner

39:16.337 --> 39:18.680
in exchange for whatever
you can tell me.

39:21.227 --> 39:23.618
I'm not supposed
to speak on the matter.

39:23.712 --> 39:24.743
Well,

39:24.798 --> 39:26.993
then I hope you can speak
on something else

39:27.101 --> 39:29.067
or our dinner's going to be

39:29.180 --> 39:31.270
awfully quiet.

39:34.907 --> 39:36.642
Louise, I can't.

39:41.649 --> 39:45.938
- That woman from the other day?
- If I've learned anything

39:45.963 --> 39:48.016
about you, it's that you don't
take no for an answer.

39:48.040 --> 39:49.235
But in this case...

39:49.354 --> 39:52.977
- I understand.
- Oh, Louise...

39:59.993 --> 40:02.868
A month ago?
Nobody's done anything about it?

40:03.149 --> 40:06.430
Oh, George! For you.
From your lady friend.

40:06.540 --> 40:09.069
- Louise?
- No, your lady friend.

40:09.140 --> 40:12.311
Miss bloom? The gorgeous woman
you're courting? With the eyes

40:12.346 --> 40:14.146
and the hair?
- Yes, Jackson.

40:14.202 --> 40:16.147
I know who I'm courting,
thank you.

40:16.241 --> 40:18.562
I was just expecting...
<i>George...</i>

40:18.694 --> 40:21.093
<i>I don't know
quite how to put this,</i>

40:21.233 --> 40:23.444
<i>except to say I'll miss you.</i>

40:23.624 --> 40:25.624
<i>The twist of fate
that brought you into my life</i>

40:25.659 --> 40:29.585
<i>was one of the greatest gifts
I've ever received.</i>

40:29.726 --> 40:32.890
<i>But we both knew your path
wouldn't end with me.</i>

40:33.062 --> 40:35.133
<i>I'm quite sure wherever it leads</i>

40:35.169 --> 40:36.812
<i>will be wondrous.</i>

40:36.952 --> 40:39.652
<i>Yours, Nina.</i>

40:39.907 --> 40:42.694
- Something the matter, George?
- It would appear

40:42.766 --> 40:45.800
I'm not courting
anybody anymore.

40:48.850 --> 40:51.893
Its true... life... because

40:52.022 --> 40:54.719
It is somewhat outlandish.
Beyond the pale,

40:54.754 --> 40:56.631
even for James Pendrick.
- If it's true,

40:56.699 --> 40:59.358
it could change the world.
- Imagine all of us,

40:59.383 --> 41:01.983
living our lives,
doing our jobs,

41:02.139 --> 41:04.295
perhaps in this very
station house,

41:04.412 --> 41:08.272
forever.
- Tom! Murdoch!

41:08.436 --> 41:09.567
James!
It's gone!

41:09.780 --> 41:11.600
- What's gone?
- The Guarana,

41:11.647 --> 41:14.772
Um, the-the formulation, my
research, all of it! It's gone!

41:14.797 --> 41:18.022
Slow down. What's happened?
- I left my lab last night

41:18.101 --> 41:20.745
to get some rest.
When I returned,

41:20.780 --> 41:23.781
Ashmi had vanished.
And all my work along with her.

41:23.936 --> 41:25.679
The fountain of youth
has been stolen?

41:25.741 --> 41:27.776
I'll never be able to
reproduce it without my notes.

41:27.800 --> 41:30.663
She no doubt intends to sell it
to the highest bidder.

41:30.788 --> 41:32.089
- I hate to say it,

41:32.125 --> 41:34.525
but she may have been
planning this all along.

41:34.655 --> 41:36.061
She was very protective of you

41:36.152 --> 41:38.765
and ensuring
that your research continued.

41:39.335 --> 41:42.186
Blinded by beauty yet again.

41:42.632 --> 41:43.890
She must be stopped.

41:44.030 --> 41:46.771
If she left last night, she could
be in another country by now.

41:46.806 --> 41:49.607
She surely is.
But she made one mistake.

41:50.257 --> 41:52.421
A letter addressed to Ashmi.

41:52.577 --> 41:54.679
From Panama City.

41:55.522 --> 41:56.639
You think
that's where she's gone?

41:56.663 --> 41:58.421
For more of that Guarana.
Precisely.

41:58.476 --> 42:01.421
My work is the gun, but
the Guarana is the ammunition.

42:01.569 --> 42:03.888
If she controls both,
there is no limit

42:03.923 --> 42:06.913
to what people will pay.
And no limit to the villainy

42:07.108 --> 42:09.243
of the potential buyers.
- Then what are you waiting for?

42:09.267 --> 42:11.686
She must be stopped.
- I'm leaving on the next train

42:11.794 --> 42:14.632
but it is a journey
fraught with danger.

42:14.999 --> 42:16.796
I only wish

42:17.015 --> 42:18.741
I had a partner.

42:25.851 --> 42:28.132
Murdoch, tell the chief constable
I'll be taking my leave.

42:28.186 --> 42:30.429
Oh, and you make sure
you keep an eye on the place.

42:30.499 --> 42:32.288
Sir, are you quite sure
about this?

42:32.358 --> 42:34.022
Of course he is.
It will be the adventure

42:34.067 --> 42:38.374
of a lifetime.
Tom, the journey begins.

42:38.679 --> 42:41.150
- You'll write, won't you?
- Where we're going the post

42:41.194 --> 42:44.476
isn't exactly regular...
- James...

42:44.827 --> 42:46.694
Course I will, Margaret.

42:47.257 --> 42:49.921
You've really lost your head
this time, Thomas.

42:50.101 --> 42:52.397
It does promise
to be quite dangerous.

42:52.546 --> 42:55.460
If you only live once,
why not make it forever?

42:55.686 --> 42:57.773
Come here, Margaret.
