01:12.770 --> 01:15.149
Now that we've finished
clamping our stool

01:15.250 --> 01:17.810
and the glue is set.
Let's move on to our table top.

01:17.889 --> 01:21.800
We're gonna show you how to do
a dado head cut move today.

01:21.889 --> 01:26.119
A dado is just a carpenter's
term for a groove cut into wood.

01:26.209 --> 01:28.919
If you use the word "dado".
your wife will think you're intelligent.

01:29.010 --> 01:33.719
- Right, Al?
- I'm not married, Tim.

01:33.889 --> 01:38.119
If you use it in a conversation.
maybe you'll get lucky.

01:41.810 --> 01:45.320
for cutting that dado, we're gonna be
using something that looks like this.

01:45.409 --> 01:47.399
Here you go, Tim.

01:48.409 --> 01:49.389
Thank you.

01:51.010 --> 01:54.320
This is the Binford Mach Three
SuperPlunge Router.

01:54.409 --> 01:57.840
A thing of beauty, isn't it?
Three horsepower motor.

01:57.929 --> 02:01.840
variable electronic speed control
and an adjustable depth-stop system.

02:01.929 --> 02:05.679
When using a router.
you wanna use a real steady hand.

02:05.770 --> 02:08.719
You could use the guide arm
so it doesn't get away from you.

02:08.810 --> 02:12.560
You don't always have to use
the guide arm if you have a steady hand.

02:12.649 --> 02:17.040
- If you want a straight line, Tim.
- I've been doing this for years, all right?

02:17.129 --> 02:19.800
Just hold the table, all right?

02:19.889 --> 02:24.080
Start our cut.
Set your depth gauge and get going.

02:41.330 --> 02:45.840
Perfect, Al.
Just does a good job of scrolling.

02:48.250 --> 02:50.959
While Al cleans up
this deliberate mess of mine.

02:51.050 --> 02:55.040
I'd like to welcome a new
family member to Tool Time.

02:55.129 --> 02:57.320
Alpena. Michigan. Cold in the winter…

02:57.409 --> 03:00.320
Pretty cold in the summer too, isn't it?

03:00.409 --> 03:03.840
Kidding around with you.
It's channel 97 there on your cable box.

03:03.929 --> 03:06.310
I'd like to give the folks
up there in Alpena -

03:06.409 --> 03:10.760
Al, there you are - a Tool Time greeting.
What do you say, Al?

03:10.850 --> 03:12.320
Come on, guys.

03:14.250 --> 03:19.480
I'll tell ya…
That's about all for Tool Time today.

03:20.409 --> 03:27.040
I'm Tim "the Tool Man" Taylor.
hoping that all your fasteners stay tight.

03:27.129 --> 03:29.199
See you next time.

03:37.889 --> 03:41.080
- Good show, Al.
- Yeah. Right, Tim.

03:41.169 --> 03:44.709
I'm installing a satellite dish this Saturday.

03:44.810 --> 03:46.919
You mean the one we used
on the show last week?

03:47.010 --> 03:49.879
They almost gave it to me, demo cost.
Cost me nothing.

03:50.010 --> 03:52.679
I'm happy for you, Tim.

03:52.770 --> 03:57.280
I was hoping you could stop by Saturday.
maybe have lunch, help me put it up.

03:57.369 --> 04:00.280
I was hoping
to have the weekend alone.

04:00.369 --> 04:02.560
Kind of a private man time.

04:03.929 --> 04:05.149
- Oh, good, Al.
- Yeah.

04:05.250 --> 04:09.399
What time are you coming tomorrow
to help me put up my bookshelves?

04:13.330 --> 04:16.199
- How about 9:00?
- Perfect. I'll see you then.

04:16.290 --> 04:18.480
- Bye, Tim.
- See you, Lis.

04:19.889 --> 04:22.719
That private man time?

04:24.330 --> 04:28.399
She's a co-worker, Tim.
I think of her as a man.

04:31.490 --> 04:34.399
That's why you're still single, Al.

04:38.929 --> 04:41.359
Once we get that satellite dish on the roof.

04:41.449 --> 04:43.480
run that co-ax cable down the wall. Mark.

04:43.570 --> 04:46.480
run it through the house.
attach it to that TV set.

04:46.570 --> 04:49.439
we are equipped to get 200 stations.

04:49.530 --> 04:51.959
- 200 stations?
- Yeah.

04:52.050 --> 04:57.439
Now it will take you 45 minutes to find out
there's nothing on you wanna watch.

05:02.090 --> 05:06.919
Can you smell that?
That's diesel fumes. That's a turbo diesel.

05:07.010 --> 05:12.080
That's 16 speeds. Tandem axle.
That's a delivery truck.

05:13.649 --> 05:17.240
- You can smell all that?
- I sure can. Come on, help me out.

05:17.330 --> 05:19.889
Go out and see
if that delivery truck's on the way.

05:19.969 --> 05:23.359
I think our satellite dish is coming.
Let me know when it's in.

05:23.449 --> 05:26.480
Great. You're a lifesaver.

05:26.570 --> 05:30.000
No. Today is fine. Come right over.

05:30.090 --> 05:33.399
Thank you so much.
I really appreciate this. OK. Bye-bye.

05:34.290 --> 05:36.359
- Who was that?
- Rondall.

05:37.169 --> 05:41.480
The teacher from that job search seminar
I've been taking.

05:41.570 --> 05:44.399
- Why is he coming over here?
- Last Monday after class.

05:44.490 --> 05:47.359
we were having coffee, and he said…

05:47.449 --> 05:50.359
Time out, flag that play.

05:50.449 --> 05:54.359
- You had coffee with Rondall?
- Yeah.

05:54.449 --> 05:57.280
You didn't tell me about this coffee.

05:57.369 --> 06:01.359
I'm sorry.
It was cream, mo sugars.

06:01.449 --> 06:06.359
Was it coffee?
Or coffee and dancing?

06:08.449 --> 06:12.679
Tim, don't be silly.
A few of us went out for coffee after class…

06:12.770 --> 06:14.359
Safety in numbers thing.

06:14.449 --> 06:18.719
Rondall said that if anybody needed any
extra help, we should give him a call.

06:18.810 --> 06:23.000
So you sprinted right over
to the phone and called him?

06:23.090 --> 06:27.240
Yes. He's gonna help me get my resume
in order for my job interview on Monday.

06:27.330 --> 06:31.359
Giving up his whole day Saturday. That
guy must have a pretty understanding wife.

06:31.449 --> 06:33.399
He's not married.

06:33.490 --> 06:36.520
How'd you find that out?
During coffee?

06:36.609 --> 06:38.639
No, while we were dancing.

06:39.689 --> 06:42.359
- That's good.
- Tim, what is the matter with you?

06:42.449 --> 06:45.639
- Don't you trust me?
- No, it's not trust. I'm just…

06:45.730 --> 06:48.189
I'm just not sure a man would give up
a Saturday for a woman

06:48.290 --> 06:50.320
unless he wanted something in return.

06:50.409 --> 06:53.359
Tim, he's just a good guy.
He's helping me out.

06:53.449 --> 06:59.359
Don't I recall you telling me that he was
this big, strapping, cute, hunk kinda guy?

06:59.449 --> 07:04.359
- You know I never said that.
- Is he kinda cute?

07:04.449 --> 07:07.439
I don't know.
Some people would say so.

07:07.530 --> 07:09.520
Cuter than me?

07:11.850 --> 07:14.409
Some people would say so.

07:19.730 --> 07:22.919
- This is cool.
- Excellent.

07:23.010 --> 07:28.030
That's true parabolic shape
for super-efficient reflectivity, men.

07:28.129 --> 07:31.280
- Mr Taylor, will you sign this, please?
- Sure, man.

07:31.369 --> 07:33.750
Oh, my God. This thing is huge.

07:33.889 --> 07:36.080
How are you ever gonna
get that up on the roof?

07:36.169 --> 07:41.159
That's why I have that pulley ratchet
system setup up there.

07:43.129 --> 07:46.520
You're gonna put this up yourself?

07:46.609 --> 07:49.359
Yeah, right.

07:57.050 --> 08:01.760
Tim, what do you know
about installing a satellite dish?

08:01.850 --> 08:02.990
It's simple.

08:03.090 --> 08:06.399
Mount it, point it straight up.
Any man can do that.

08:08.730 --> 08:11.439
Yeah, but…

08:11.530 --> 08:15.399
it has to stay up longer
than ten seconds.

08:22.810 --> 08:24.359
That must be Rondall.

08:24.449 --> 08:27.359
Boys. look.
It's the dancing coffee drinker.

08:27.449 --> 08:32.570
This interview is really important to me and
this guy's gonna help me. Please behave.

08:32.649 --> 08:36.350
I promise I will be a perfect gentleman
the entire time he's here.

08:36.448 --> 08:40.359
- How does this thing work. Dad?
- Use your imagination, if you will.

08:40.448 --> 08:43.679
You look up there, there are
satellites orbiting the planet.

08:43.770 --> 08:46.000
sucking up information
from every corner of the globe

08:46.090 --> 08:48.359
and spitting it back down here
in this parabolic dish.

08:48.449 --> 08:52.359
This is very dangerous, though, satellite
dishes, cos they have a pulse of their own.

08:52.449 --> 08:56.639
If you don't watch out.
they can suck you into them.

09:02.609 --> 09:05.199
Tim? Tim?

09:05.290 --> 09:09.520
This is Rondall Kittleman.
Rondall, this is my husband Tim.

09:09.609 --> 09:10.800
Hi, Tim.

09:10.889 --> 09:13.449
These are my boys.
That's Randy, Mark and Brad.

09:13.530 --> 09:15.320
- Hi, guys.
- I was…

09:15.409 --> 09:19.840
I was just showing the kids
how scientific these… We just got this.

09:19.929 --> 09:22.600
- Really? It's a beauty.
- Help me. Dad. It's sucking me in.

09:22.689 --> 09:24.990
No, it's not.

09:25.090 --> 09:27.240
I don't know where they get these ideas.

09:27.330 --> 09:29.320
Come on, you guys, get outta here.

09:30.449 --> 09:33.159
Mommy. look. I got a splinter.

09:33.250 --> 09:36.119
Oh, honey. Let's get the tweezers
and we'll get that out.

09:36.209 --> 09:38.560
Will you excuse me?
Just a minute.

09:38.649 --> 09:42.040
Honey. I hope you realize
I'm gonna have to use the needle.

09:42.129 --> 09:44.199
No.

09:45.649 --> 09:52.080
- Jill's told me a lot about you. Ron.
- Rondall. It's Ron.., dall.

09:52.169 --> 09:53.149
Great name.

09:56.169 --> 10:01.399
- You know, you look familiar.
- Well, you've probably seen me on TV.

10:01.490 --> 10:03.869
I got my own home improvement show.
Jill told you about it.

10:03.969 --> 10:06.159
No, she didn't mention it.

10:06.250 --> 10:08.359
Oh, no. Right, right.
Wait a minute, of course.

10:08.449 --> 10:11.359
That's why you look familiar.
You got that little tool show on the cable.

10:11.449 --> 10:14.010
We don't look at it as little
because we pick up a lot of cities.

10:14.090 --> 10:16.389
- We just got Alpena.
- Yeah? Really?

10:16.490 --> 10:18.919
Both sets?

10:19.010 --> 10:21.280
Sorry. Just kidding you there, pal.

10:21.369 --> 10:24.000
That's pretty funny. Rondall.

10:24.089 --> 10:28.119
Do that thing you do on the show.
That barking sound.

10:31.690 --> 10:35.000
It's really not barking.
It's more like a simian grunt.

10:36.210 --> 10:39.799
Yeah, barking, grunting, whatever.
It's a very funny show.

10:39.889 --> 10:42.350
- You're very funny on it.
- It's not all fun and games.

10:42.449 --> 10:44.000
It's a home improvement show.
Basically what we do…

10:44.089 --> 10:45.920
Well, but you're very funny on it.

10:46.009 --> 10:49.920
Not like the other guy on the show.
The guy who knows everything.

10:53.009 --> 10:57.759
Al. Al's my assistant.
He assists me.

11:02.130 --> 11:05.239
- Everything's ready. Do you want to start?
- Sure.

11:05.330 --> 11:08.279
I'd like to help you guys, but I'm gonna
finish up that satellite stuff.

11:08.369 --> 11:10.480
- Can I take your coat?
- Thank you.

11:10.569 --> 11:13.130
Your husband's putting up
a satellite dish?

11:13.210 --> 11:15.080
Yeah. This afternoon.

11:15.170 --> 11:19.440
- I hope you have some help.
- Don't need any help. Bondo.

11:20.810 --> 11:24.350
- No. I'm gonna do it all by myself.
- Maybe you should call Al.

11:24.449 --> 11:27.400
He really knows about all that stuff.

11:30.770 --> 11:36.080
- Al is my assistant. He assists me.
- Yeah. I think you should listen to Jill.

11:36.170 --> 11:40.560
When I had mine put in. I had a couple of
guys from Global View Satellites install it.

11:40.650 --> 11:42.880
Did ya?

11:42.969 --> 11:45.159
That must have cost
you a pretty penny?

11:45.250 --> 11:47.360
You know, it was worth it
when you consider that

11:47.449 --> 11:50.040
the installation requires
a precise calculation

11:50.130 --> 11:53.400
of the declination angle of the dish
in relation to the equator.

11:56.290 --> 11:57.719
Yeah.

11:59.130 --> 12:04.069
The slightest deviation and the dish
is useless. Of course, you know that.

12:04.170 --> 12:06.520
It goes without saying.

12:07.449 --> 12:09.750
Tim, call Al.

12:11.449 --> 12:14.440
Al is busy today.

12:15.449 --> 12:19.230
The important thing right now
is that you get that dish up on the roof.

12:19.330 --> 12:22.199
No problemo. Rondanello.

12:26.210 --> 12:31.360
- Wilson? Wilson, you back there?
- Right here, good neighbor.

12:31.449 --> 12:34.480
When you watch my show Tool Time.
do you think I'm funny?

12:34.569 --> 12:39.279
I've got to be honest with you, Tim.
I've never seen the show.

12:39.369 --> 12:42.080
- You've never seen my show?
- No.

12:42.170 --> 12:45.279
- But I don't have a television.
- Everybody's got a TV.

12:45.369 --> 12:48.520
Not me. I just use my imagination.

12:48.610 --> 12:50.759
Watch the pictures inside my mind.

12:55.250 --> 12:57.520
Cuts down on reruns then, doesn't it?

12:59.089 --> 13:01.839
Not really, Tim. There's always déjà vu.

13:03.650 --> 13:04.920
Right.

13:05.610 --> 13:08.679
Tim. I got the feeling you got something
more on your mind than television.

13:08.770 --> 13:10.759
Not really. Wilson.

13:10.850 --> 13:15.869
It's just Jill is working on her rėsumė
with this guy, a know-it-all type.

13:15.969 --> 13:17.759
He's trying to impress her.

13:19.210 --> 13:20.429
That worries you?

13:20.529 --> 13:24.839
I'm not jealous.
I'm the least jealous guy on earth, really.

13:24.929 --> 13:29.560
Curious thing about jealousy.
Usually it stems from insecurity.

13:30.569 --> 13:33.839
There's no insecurity here.
I can tell you that.

13:33.929 --> 13:37.920
However much I'm not jealous.
I'm mice as much not insecure.

13:39.449 --> 13:42.360
You should be secure, Tim.
You've got what every man dreams of.

13:42.449 --> 13:45.400
Yeah. A satellite dish.

13:48.130 --> 13:53.400
No, Tim. Three strapping boys.
a nice home, a loving wife.

13:56.369 --> 13:58.400
You're so right, you know.

13:58.489 --> 14:01.360
Jill and I share so many great things.

14:01.449 --> 14:06.199
memories, great food - we love eating.
you know - laughter.

14:06.290 --> 14:09.080
Nobody makes her laugh like I do.

14:31.320 --> 14:32.590
What's so funny?
What are you laughing at?

14:32.679 --> 14:34.470
It's nothing at all. Really.

14:34.559 --> 14:36.629
Come on.
We always laugh around here.

14:36.720 --> 14:38.750
- Come on. What's so funny?
- Well. OK.

14:38.840 --> 14:43.389
There's a woman in our class
that was always asking questions…

14:46.399 --> 14:49.230
- No, honey, that's not the funny part.
- Of course not.

14:49.320 --> 14:53.230
So, anyway, one day Rondall
asked if there are any questions.

14:53.320 --> 14:57.710
and the woman stands up
and forgets what she's gonna say.

14:57.799 --> 15:00.100
I told you it's not funny.

15:01.519 --> 15:04.190
I guess you had to be there.

15:04.279 --> 15:08.230
I got to make some measurements for this
cable. Just pretend like I'm not here.

15:08.320 --> 15:09.990
Listen. About this interview.

15:10.080 --> 15:13.389
I was gonna wear this blue suit
with a plain white blouse.

15:13.480 --> 15:17.259
- Is that just too blah?
- No. I like white. It's simple but it's classic.

15:17.360 --> 15:20.629
It shows you're not a slave to trends.

15:23.279 --> 15:25.230
What was that, Tim?

15:26.360 --> 15:29.190
Nothing.
I was thinking about that joke.

15:29.279 --> 15:32.269
"She didn't know what to say."

15:33.360 --> 15:35.470
It just took me a while.

15:37.320 --> 15:40.909
Anyway. Rondall, this jacket
has really big shoulder pads.

15:41.000 --> 15:45.190
Should I take them out? They say wide
shoulders make your neck look geeky.

15:45.279 --> 15:50.399
No. Wide shoulders
show that you bear responsibility.

15:58.320 --> 16:00.830
Maybe we should just
get back to the rėsumė.

16:00.919 --> 16:05.710
OK. I brought samples over.
which I left in the car.

16:05.799 --> 16:08.950
I'll go get them. Be right back.

16:12.600 --> 16:14.830
Tim, what was this?

16:16.039 --> 16:18.389
I was shoveling manure.

16:19.399 --> 16:21.389
You're not buying this crock?

16:21.480 --> 16:24.710
I love this stuff.
Shoulder pads show strength and motion.

16:24.799 --> 16:27.470
- Color just brighten your life.
- I know.

16:27.559 --> 16:30.669
It sounds really stupid.
But the guy is a professional.

16:30.759 --> 16:32.909
What is the matter with you?

16:33.000 --> 16:37.230
What's the matter with me is I'm seeing
a guy in my house hitting on my wife.

16:37.320 --> 16:39.429
- What?
- Come on.

16:39.519 --> 16:43.190
Don't be so naive.
You see what's happening here?

16:43.279 --> 16:44.259
No.

16:44.360 --> 16:50.269
Guy's over here on Saturday.
drinking coffee, making you laugh.

16:52.360 --> 16:55.350
Oh. God. You're right.

16:55.440 --> 16:58.230
How could I have
missed something so obvious?

16:58.320 --> 17:02.870
He's obviously just a great big
walking hormone.

17:02.960 --> 17:08.079
You laugh. You make jokes.
I can smell testosterone right here.

17:09.358 --> 17:12.269
And just a wee bit of estrogen thrown in.

17:12.358 --> 17:15.029
- Tim.
- Look at this.

17:15.118 --> 17:16.789
- Look.
- Tim, get out of there.

17:16.880 --> 17:21.190
- That is his personal property.
- Look at this. Breath mints, cigarettes.

17:21.839 --> 17:24.990
Now I've got it.
This is before.

17:25.079 --> 17:27.348
This is after.

17:28.559 --> 17:31.910
There may be a very good reason
for him to have breath mints.

17:32.000 --> 17:33.990
Rondall may just have bad breath.

17:34.079 --> 17:36.069
Actually. I don't.

17:41.559 --> 17:45.990
I'm sorry. Sometimes when people smoke.
they have bad breath…

17:46.079 --> 17:50.349
Would you excuse me for a minute?
I want to talk to Tim.

17:55.319 --> 17:59.230
I haven't worked in a really long time.

17:59.319 --> 18:03.549
I'm really nervous about my interview
on Monday. This guy is trying to help me.

18:03.640 --> 18:08.109
This guy would be helping himself
to you if I wasn't here.

18:08.200 --> 18:11.630
No chance of that. You haven't left us
alone for more than ten minutes.

18:11.720 --> 18:15.190
- Is that what you want? Ten minutes?
- I just wanna finish my rėsumė.

18:15.279 --> 18:17.269
All right. Excuse me.

18:19.519 --> 18:23.710
I'll be up on the roof, completely out
of sight. You won't hear me all day.

18:23.799 --> 18:26.710
I can't hear a thing.
I'll be up there all by myself.

18:27.599 --> 18:29.589
Thank you.

18:33.400 --> 18:36.190
I am so sorry for all the interruptions.

18:36.279 --> 18:38.230
That's OK.
Maybe we can do this another time.

18:38.319 --> 18:42.670
But my interview at
the Duncan Phillips Agency is on Monday.

18:43.319 --> 18:45.309
OK. Well. Let's finish your rėsumė.

18:45.400 --> 18:47.230
- We're almost done.
- Thank you.

18:47.319 --> 18:50.430
- What time is your appointment?
- It's 2:00.

18:50.519 --> 18:53.269
Why don't you and I
have lunch together?

18:54.319 --> 18:57.509
Are you saying, lunch just you and me?
The two of us?

18:57.599 --> 19:00.990
Of course not. I'm a good friend
of the VP in sales over there.

19:01.079 --> 19:05.269
- You could join us before the interview.
- Great.

19:06.759 --> 19:10.230
That would be a tremendous help.

19:14.319 --> 19:20.069
When you put down your educational
information, make sure… I'm sorry.

19:20.160 --> 19:23.230
I forgot my friend won't be back
from Cleveland on Monday.

19:25.039 --> 19:27.599
But you and I could still get together.

19:27.680 --> 19:31.220
You mean that we're
back to you and I alone together?

19:40.759 --> 19:46.230
Jill, you know your husband's hanging
from the roof, spying on us.

19:46.319 --> 19:50.990
No, he's not spying on us.
He's just hanging upside down.

19:51.079 --> 19:55.349
He does that all the time.
to check things.

19:55.440 --> 19:58.109
- I think he has a problem with me.
- No. He really likes you.

19:58.200 --> 19:59.869
- Does he?
- Yeah.

20:02.079 --> 20:04.349
I think he's a bit
uncomfortable with me.

20:04.440 --> 20:07.230
I think it's because he's
sensing what I've been sensing.

20:07.319 --> 20:10.390
- Which is what?
- You have been sending out signals.

20:12.599 --> 20:15.029
Signals? What signals?

20:15.119 --> 20:21.109
- You asked me out for coffee after class.
- No! That was just…

20:21.200 --> 20:24.710
There were four of us.
You were way across the table.

20:24.799 --> 20:29.269
Yeah, but every time I turn around from the
blackboard I see you staring into my eyes.

20:29.359 --> 20:32.029
No, that's just paying attention.
That's a good thing.

20:32.119 --> 20:33.230
I don't know why you're fighting it. Jill.

20:33.319 --> 20:35.950
There's obviously something
happening between us.

20:36.039 --> 20:39.230
I feel it. You feel it.
It's chemistry.

20:39.319 --> 20:41.700
No. I flunked chemistry.

20:41.799 --> 20:45.109
Jill, you're playing hard to get.
I love that.

20:45.200 --> 20:49.069
No. I'm playing "no get."
I am a "no get" woman.

20:49.160 --> 20:52.829
I'm a happy, married. "no get" woman.
with a wonderful husband.

20:59.599 --> 21:01.390
There's Mr Wonderful now.

21:01.480 --> 21:05.349
- Honey, are you all right?
- Just testing the safety line on this.

21:09.480 --> 21:13.099
I'm sorry, but I'm gonna
have to ask you to leave.

21:13.720 --> 21:18.230
That's good. You're pretending to throw me
out because your husband can see us.

21:18.319 --> 21:20.430
No. I'm really throwing you out.

21:20.519 --> 21:22.869
Speak a little louder so he can hear you.

21:22.960 --> 21:24.269
Here's you coat. There's the door.

21:24.359 --> 21:27.230
That's a good touch with the jacket.
I like that.

21:27.319 --> 21:29.549
Rondall, you want a signal?

21:29.640 --> 21:31.670
Here is your signal.

21:32.759 --> 21:35.990
I'm confused.
Does that mean we're not having lunch?

21:36.079 --> 21:38.269
Get out.

21:41.079 --> 21:45.349
- Jill. Come on out here, please.
- Tim. I don't believe it.

21:45.440 --> 21:49.190
- I am so embarrassed. I feel like fool.
- Could you untangle that rope?

21:49.359 --> 21:52.670
You were right. That slime came on to me.
He wanted me to have lunch with him.

21:52.759 --> 21:54.589
Get him out here.

21:54.680 --> 21:58.220
- No. I took care of it. I threw him out.
- Good for you.

21:58.319 --> 22:02.190
- He said I was sending him signals.
- Jill, could you just untie this knot?

22:02.279 --> 22:04.839
- I would never send signals.
- I know you wouldn't.

22:04.920 --> 22:06.910
Let's talk about this another time.
My legs are numb.

22:07.000 --> 22:09.559
I am so sorry.
I just never realized…

22:09.640 --> 22:11.710
I'm a married woman.
I got three kids.

22:11.799 --> 22:14.630
You're a beautiful,
intelligent, sexy woman.

22:14.720 --> 22:17.670
He'd be a fool not to hit on you.

22:17.759 --> 22:21.950
Oh, Tim. You're so sweet.

22:24.440 --> 22:28.190
- Could you cut me down, please?
- No. I like you like this.

22:32.920 --> 22:37.349
All right, settle in.
200 channels of family entertainment.

22:38.680 --> 22:41.589
Seen it. Seen it. Seen that.

22:41.680 --> 22:44.349
Seen it. Seen it. Seen it.

22:45.240 --> 22:48.069
Will you slow down?
Let me have that thing.

22:49.319 --> 22:52.069
- What's that?
- Sumo wrestling from Japan.

22:53.119 --> 22:54.099
Seen it.

22:55.680 --> 22:58.140
Now, that's better. Opera.
