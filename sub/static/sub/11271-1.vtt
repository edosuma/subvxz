00:06.012 --> 00:10.100
Remember the day I said
you are the nuttiest, stupidest,

00:10.266 --> 00:12.727
phoniest fruitcake I ever met.

00:12.894 --> 00:15.730
- You are the most arrogant...
- Shut up!

00:15.897 --> 00:18.107
- Shut your fat mouth.
- Make me.

00:18.273 --> 00:23.529
Make you? I'm going to bounce you
off every wall in this office.

00:23.696 --> 00:26.615
Try it and you'll walk funny tomorrow.

00:29.075 --> 00:31.119
Or should I say funnier.

00:31.285 --> 00:34.872
You know,
I always wanted to pop you one.

00:35.039 --> 00:37.083
Maybe this is my lucky day.

00:37.250 --> 00:40.877
- You disgust me.
- Are you as turned on as I am?

00:41.044 --> 00:43.130
- More.
- Bet me.

00:49.468 --> 00:55.391
- It sure got quiet all of a sudden.
- You don't think he killed her?

00:55.558 --> 00:59.686
No. Even in death,
she wouldn't be that quiet.

00:59.853 --> 01:04.482
What do you think they're doing
if they're not fighting?

02:21.469 --> 02:25.640
- Isn't it nice that we're not fighting?
- Yes.

02:32.854 --> 02:38.317
Let's go someplace where we can feeI
free to express what we're feeling.

02:38.484 --> 02:43.614
- Great. How about the couch?
- The couch.

02:46.367 --> 02:51.496
- Who said we had to be serious?
- Will you stop joking?

02:51.663 --> 02:57.502
I want to go someplace intimate,
someplace romantic.

02:57.669 --> 03:00.837
Yeah. OK. Romantic. Yeah.

03:02.214 --> 03:04.258
My apartment?

03:04.424 --> 03:07.678
- Your apartment?
- There I go again.

03:07.844 --> 03:12.098
- I think that's a good idea.
- That's why I said it.

03:12.265 --> 03:17.853
Your apartment. The place you spend
half your life and I've never even seen it.

03:18.020 --> 03:20.523
I think you're going to like it.

03:20.690 --> 03:25.276
I'll give you my famous guided tour.

03:25.443 --> 03:28.405
Starting in the bedroom.

03:30.281 --> 03:32.491
And ending in heaven.

03:42.001 --> 03:44.168
- Come on.
- Sam.

03:44.335 --> 03:47.588
- What?
- I've changed my mind.

03:52.885 --> 03:57.889
I mean about your apartment.
You'll think I'm overly sensitive,

03:58.056 --> 04:01.309
but, Sam,
you've been with a lot of women.

04:01.476 --> 04:04.187
I have not. There have not been many.

04:04.353 --> 04:08.399
It gets exaggerated here.
There haven't been many.

04:08.566 --> 04:14.572
- How many have there been?
- Well, I don't know. Maybe four hun...

04:15.697 --> 04:20.910
Four honeys. Maybe that's more than
my share, but it's all behind me now.

04:21.077 --> 04:26.331
You see, that's what I mean.
I want to be speciaI.

04:26.498 --> 04:29.918
I want to go someplace
you've never been with a woman.

04:30.085 --> 04:34.131
All right. OK. That's easy enough.

04:34.298 --> 04:36.341
Like where?

04:37.884 --> 04:44.223
- How about a hoteI?
- Yeah. That's great.

04:44.390 --> 04:48.685
- One you've never been to with anyone.
- All right.

04:50.187 --> 04:52.272
That's easy.

04:54.900 --> 04:57.360
Let's see. Hotels.

04:57.527 --> 05:00.404
There we go. No.

05:02.406 --> 05:03.908
No.

05:04.074 --> 05:08.245
- Well, I'll be darned.
- Forget it.

05:08.412 --> 05:13.166
Come on. We're being silly here.
Why don't we go to your place?

05:15.627 --> 05:19.172
- Well, I guess that could be all right.
- Great.

05:19.339 --> 05:22.716
Wait. Sam, it's so filthy.

05:22.883 --> 05:26.637
It doesn't have to be
if we care about each other.

05:30.724 --> 05:33.142
What?

05:33.309 --> 05:39.273
No. I mean my apartment.
I haven't straightened it up for days.

05:39.440 --> 05:44.903
I don't care. As long as we're together,
it doesn't matter where we are.

05:45.070 --> 05:48.949
Sam, that's beautifuI.

05:49.115 --> 05:52.202
We're not talking pigsty here, are we?

05:53.619 --> 05:57.164
- No, of course not.
- All right, then. Come on.

05:57.331 --> 05:59.833
- OK.
- Boy!

06:04.212 --> 06:06.839
She'd better be great.

06:09.717 --> 06:14.763
I know you must be curious about
what Sam and I were talking about.

06:14.930 --> 06:18.141
We want to be totally honest with you.

06:22.479 --> 06:27.775
It is said that fools rush in
where wise men fear to tread.

06:27.942 --> 06:30.945
But the heart has a wisdom of its own

06:31.112 --> 06:36.450
and Sam and I have decided to traverse
the fall line of our aloneness.

06:41.496 --> 06:44.958
- What's she talking about?
- I don't know.

06:46.042 --> 06:49.795
- Is this what we were talking about?
- Of course.

06:49.962 --> 06:53.841
We decided
we're going to start messing around.

06:55.634 --> 06:59.470
- That's good. Great.
- So we'll see you all later.

07:01.514 --> 07:06.686
Wait. I feeI damned by faint praise.
What's wrong?

07:06.853 --> 07:09.896
- What do you mean?
- Nothing's wrong.

07:11.481 --> 07:15.402
You don't seem very happy
about our announcement.

07:15.569 --> 07:19.031
You know, Diane, it's just kind of sudden.

07:19.197 --> 07:24.660
- It's just happening kind of fast.
- We wish you all the luck in the world.

07:24.827 --> 07:26.871
It won't be enough.

07:30.957 --> 07:35.962
I know you're thinking we have
different backgrounds and dreams.

07:36.129 --> 07:41.176
Well, let me tell you, we have one thing
very much in common...

07:41.342 --> 07:44.386
I got it. They were both born brunette.

07:50.476 --> 07:53.519
We are willing to be vulnerable
to one another.

07:53.686 --> 07:57.774
I see a trip to ye old leash
and leather shop coming up.

08:02.904 --> 08:09.201
I am sorry that you're all so cynicaI
that you can't accept Sam and me.

08:09.367 --> 08:12.454
It doesn't bother us.
We believe in us, right?

08:12.621 --> 08:19.668
You bet. It'll be great. I may have to work
harder on this one, but it'll be worth it.

08:19.835 --> 08:22.797
- Thank you, Sam.
- You're welcome.

08:22.963 --> 08:29.761
Now, if you will excuse us, we are going
to go out and begin our lives together.

08:30.845 --> 08:35.850
There's more to heaven and earth
than is dreamt of in your beer mugs.

08:36.017 --> 08:40.770
- What do you mean work a little harder?
- I didn't mean anything.

08:40.938 --> 08:44.066
I think they might have misunderstood.

08:56.202 --> 08:59.538
Thanks for picking the flowers
for me in the park.

08:59.704 --> 09:02.541
Thank you for paying the fine.

09:03.959 --> 09:07.879
We make a good team.
So what do you think of my place?

09:08.046 --> 09:11.215
Very nice. Is this the bedroom?

09:11.382 --> 09:17.137
Nice? I want you to know that I'm putting
a lot of energy into the decorating.

09:17.304 --> 09:21.057
- It shows. Where's the light?
- Over by the bed.

09:22.225 --> 09:26.729
I think I stepped on your cat.
My God, I think I killed it.

09:27.814 --> 09:33.402
- My mistake. I stepped on your giraffe.
- Mr Jammers.

09:36.655 --> 09:39.283
This place is lousy with stuffed animals.

09:39.449 --> 09:45.288
They're not stuffed animals. They're
friends. Mr Jammers you've met.

09:45.454 --> 09:50.710
- Over here is Freddy Frogbottom.
- You named all these silly things?

09:50.876 --> 09:54.587
Don't call them silly.
Mr Buzzer will sting you.

09:55.714 --> 10:00.051
Mr Buzzer? Let me guess.
That must be the bee, right?

10:00.218 --> 10:02.762
This is definitely weird.

10:06.932 --> 10:11.478
- That is exactly what's wrong with you.
- What's wrong with me?

10:13.605 --> 10:16.983
You don't have any imagination
about this.

10:17.150 --> 10:22.405
No sense of whimsy.
You're so earthbound. So uninspired.

10:22.572 --> 10:24.823
I can't believe
you're making such a big deaI.

10:26.700 --> 10:30.328
Sam Malone, those animals
happen to be a part of me.

10:30.495 --> 10:34.207
Why can't you indulge that...
What are you doing?

10:34.374 --> 10:38.169
- I'm taking my pants off.
- Why?

10:38.335 --> 10:41.505
Well, not to give Mr Buzzer a target.

10:43.382 --> 10:48.011
We're arguing. How could you take
your pants off in a fight?

10:48.178 --> 10:53.308
It won't last all night. I don't want
to be overdressed when it ends.

10:53.475 --> 10:56.519
- Get out of here.
- You want me to leave?

10:56.686 --> 11:00.647
- I demand that you leave.
- Let me tell you a rule I have.

11:00.814 --> 11:05.778
Mr Malone doesn't put his pants
on again untiI he finishes business.

11:05.944 --> 11:09.447
- Bet me.
- Diane, would you please...

11:09.614 --> 11:13.409
Would you give me a break
and let me put my...

11:13.576 --> 11:15.661
You are despicable.

11:15.828 --> 11:19.790
I never want to see
your fat, ugly face again. Get out.

11:19.956 --> 11:23.335
Come on.
I'm losing the mood here, Diane.

11:27.464 --> 11:32.718
- You'II lose a lot more than that.
- Wait. Do you want to know the truth?

11:32.885 --> 11:36.013
It wasn't four women.
It was 400 women, easy.

11:36.180 --> 11:38.432
They'd have to be.

11:48.940 --> 11:55.362
Most of the guys I broke
into the majors with are all gone now.

11:55.529 --> 11:59.992
- You mean gone to the great beyond?
- No, Alan, dead.

12:02.577 --> 12:08.165
I can't understand it. You wonder,
you're born, you grow up, you die.

12:08.332 --> 12:10.960
Is that the end? Is that it?

12:11.127 --> 12:15.422
There's various theories
about an afterlife, Coach.

12:15.588 --> 12:18.883
Millions believe in reincarnation.

12:19.050 --> 12:22.262
You mean
when you come back as a chicken?

12:23.179 --> 12:25.597
Not necessarily as a chicken.

12:25.764 --> 12:31.020
Hindus believe what you come back as
depends on your behaviour.

12:31.186 --> 12:34.773
Lead a good life to come back
in an elevated state.

12:34.940 --> 12:36.983
Like Colorado?

12:39.068 --> 12:42.030
No, Coach. More like a king or a prince.

12:43.156 --> 12:48.577
If you've not led a good life,
you'll come back in a lowly condition.

12:48.744 --> 12:53.331
Last time out, I must have made
a reaI ass out of myself.

12:54.207 --> 12:57.376
I figure if you're dead, you're dead.

12:57.543 --> 13:01.172
This idea of living forever
doesn't appeaI.

13:01.338 --> 13:03.424
I can see why, PauI.

13:07.803 --> 13:09.846
Hey, Sam.

13:10.013 --> 13:14.100
- What do you think about death?
- Too good for her.

13:14.267 --> 13:17.520
I don't want to talk to anyone.
I mean it.

13:19.104 --> 13:22.357
- I knew it.
- We told them so.

13:22.524 --> 13:25.235
- They wouldn't listen.
- Forget it.

13:25.402 --> 13:28.197
Something's wrong
with Sam and Diane.

13:28.363 --> 13:32.283
- We're talking about Sam and Diane.
- You are? That's better.

13:32.450 --> 13:37.538
- It's none of our business.
- We ought to do something about it.

13:37.705 --> 13:42.709
- Everybody deserves a chance.
- I think we owe Sam an apology.

13:42.876 --> 13:47.589
- I'm going to chat to Sammy.
- He doesn't want to be disturbed.

13:47.756 --> 13:51.759
He didn't mean me.
Sammy and I are pals. We're tight.

13:54.345 --> 13:58.307
- Sammy? Norm.
- Get the hell out of here!

13:58.474 --> 14:03.144
- You bet, buddy.
- That was inspiring, Norm.

14:04.229 --> 14:06.481
- I'm sorry.
- We're sorry.

14:06.648 --> 14:09.275
We're sorry about what we said.

14:09.442 --> 14:12.362
You're no worse a match
than anybody else.

14:12.529 --> 14:18.367
- Any two people will be a long shot.
- Right. Long shots come in some time.

14:18.534 --> 14:23.288
No. You guys were right.
I must have lost my mind for a minute.

14:23.455 --> 14:27.708
The old Sam Malone is back, boys.
Ready for action.

14:27.875 --> 14:33.297
I'm going to grab the first woman
that comes by and I'm going to go crazy.

14:35.799 --> 14:37.842
Yeah, Carla, what is it?

14:39.261 --> 14:41.346
Nothing.

14:41.513 --> 14:45.058
It feels good to be finally rid of her.

14:45.225 --> 14:50.437
Let me have a soda. Things are going
to be more the way they used to be.

14:50.604 --> 14:54.316
Glad to hear you say that.
You'll be a better man.

14:54.483 --> 14:59.779
- Coach, are you buying this?
- Buying it? I'm not even following it.

15:03.074 --> 15:07.036
- Carla, I mean it.
- I believe you, Sammy. I do.

15:07.203 --> 15:09.830
I could tell you how to get Diane back.

15:12.040 --> 15:17.504
Tell you what. If you're interested,
I'll be down at the end of the bar.

15:28.973 --> 15:32.350
Well, it's got to be good for a laugh.

15:40.065 --> 15:42.109
How?

15:42.276 --> 15:47.281
Women have always come easy to you.
Now you have got a toughie.

15:47.448 --> 15:53.119
Let me tell you how to handle her.
Now, I don't care what we women say

15:53.286 --> 15:57.665
when we get dressed up
and go on the PhiI Donahue show.

15:58.750 --> 16:04.004
Every woman wants to be controlled.
Even your Miss Egghead there.

16:04.171 --> 16:08.675
Women like power, Sammy.
Raw, naked power.

16:08.842 --> 16:12.554
I stayed with Nick so long
because he had power.

16:12.720 --> 16:14.889
He was a gentleman sometimes.

16:15.056 --> 16:21.687
He would take me out to a romantic
dinner at a fancy restaurant.

16:21.854 --> 16:25.148
They'd call our number and he'd go get it.

16:29.319 --> 16:33.615
But once we got into the bedroom,
he called the shots.

16:33.782 --> 16:39.203
She's right. One time I had to get tough
with Vera. Really lay down the law.

16:39.369 --> 16:43.749
Next night I came home,
she was wearing a saran wrap bikini.

16:46.375 --> 16:50.088
I haven't been able
to look at a sandwich since.

16:55.259 --> 16:57.302
You know, you're right.

16:57.469 --> 17:02.474
I have let her have her way
every step in this relationship.

17:02.641 --> 17:06.603
She's leading me around by the nose.
Not any more.

17:06.770 --> 17:10.897
She has picked the wrong guy
to have a power play with.

17:11.065 --> 17:17.404
I'm going to go over and tell her there's
a time to put up and a time to shut up.

17:18.320 --> 17:21.406
It's time for her to put up and shut up.

17:21.574 --> 17:24.828
- She'll have him for breakfast.
- He's a goner.

17:24.993 --> 17:27.038
Dead in the water.

17:29.873 --> 17:33.293
Where did you get that tan?
Were you in the sun?

17:33.460 --> 17:36.797
What are you talking about?
Look at your tan.

17:36.964 --> 17:40.049
I couldn't live
where there was no sun.

17:40.216 --> 17:42.385
How can prisoners stand it?

17:42.552 --> 17:46.806
- Diane, open up.
- Go away, Sam.

17:47.890 --> 17:51.142
- I'm meditating.
- Open the door, Diane.

17:51.309 --> 17:54.229
I have something I want to say.

18:00.402 --> 18:03.487
Sam, we were not made in heaven.

18:03.654 --> 18:06.824
We turn into idiots
in each other's company.

18:06.991 --> 18:12.079
The difference in your case is barely
perceptible, but it's bothering me.

18:12.245 --> 18:15.331
Open up. It's the last time I'll tell you.

18:15.498 --> 18:21.004
- Who the hell do you think you are?
- That was your last warning.

18:21.170 --> 18:25.340
What are you doing? Sam, stop it.

18:30.929 --> 18:35.600
Now you've done it. You broke my door.
You'll pay for that, ape.

18:35.766 --> 18:40.354
Ape? I like that. Yeah, I like that. Ape.

18:40.521 --> 18:43.816
You are going to pay for a lot of things.

18:51.906 --> 18:54.993
Get in that bedroom, woman.

19:01.874 --> 19:03.876
Okay.

19:09.839 --> 19:14.302
Would you give me a minute
to slip into something flimsy?

19:14.469 --> 19:16.512
Yeah. Sure.

19:34.779 --> 19:39.866
- Are you talking to somebody?
- I'm on the phone. Just a second.

19:42.952 --> 19:47.207
You're making a telephone call?
Who did you call?

19:47.373 --> 19:51.627
The police. Would you like some coffee
while we wait?

19:55.589 --> 19:57.716
You called the police? Why?

19:57.883 --> 20:03.262
Act like a marauding Hun and you'll be
treated like one. You take cream?

20:03.429 --> 20:06.599
Yeah, but, no. Wait.

20:06.766 --> 20:11.020
Wait a minute. Are you serious?
You called the cops on me?

20:11.187 --> 20:13.230
I'm serious.

20:13.396 --> 20:18.193
I've got fresh ground, but it'll take time.
They'll be right over.

20:18.985 --> 20:23.239
Come on. Wait a second.
I'm not doing anything here.

20:23.405 --> 20:27.701
You broke into my apartment.
I have the evidence.

20:29.286 --> 20:33.457
You know, you're a loon.
That's what you are.

20:33.623 --> 20:37.418
- I'm getting the hell out of here.
- You have to run?

20:39.587 --> 20:43.341
I'll call the police
and give them your address.

20:43.508 --> 20:47.219
You make me so mad.
I'd like to take your face and...

20:47.386 --> 20:53.517
Excuse me. Be carefuI what you say.
It could be used against you in court.

20:55.393 --> 20:58.479
What's the finaI verdict on the coffee?

21:01.482 --> 21:05.403
What are you doing to me?
I'm losing my mind here.

21:05.570 --> 21:11.825
I thought you could be the woman
to make me happy for the rest of my life.

21:11.992 --> 21:15.245
Now I'd be happy just to stay out of jaiI.

21:16.621 --> 21:19.540
You make me sorry I was ever born.

21:21.875 --> 21:24.503
Sam, I know how you feeI.

21:26.297 --> 21:29.340
Don't let them take me away.

21:30.466 --> 21:36.681
Sam, the important thing here is that
we've both learned something tonight.

21:36.848 --> 21:42.978
You've learned that violence
has no place in a romantic relationship.

21:43.145 --> 21:45.188
No place at all.

21:46.273 --> 21:51.110
- And I've discovered something, too.
- What?

21:52.570 --> 21:54.822
I like the lift part.

22:00.077 --> 22:02.120
I like it a lot.

22:16.925 --> 22:21.388
You know,
you've made my life a living hell.

22:22.764 --> 22:26.017
I didn't want you to think it was easy.

22:32.482 --> 22:36.026
Let me just kick these things
off the bed here.

22:36.193 --> 22:38.236
Put them in the other room.

22:38.403 --> 22:42.199
I'll be less inhibited
if they're in the other room.

22:42.366 --> 22:47.036
Be very carefuI, because some of them
are old and sensitive.

22:49.330 --> 22:55.752
- Shouldn't you call the cops off?
- Silly Sam. I never called the police.

23:10.641 --> 23:16.480
Sam, keep Gary Gorilla and Mr Jammers
apart. They don't get along.

23:17.563 --> 23:20.441
Not to worry. They're a mile apart.

23:57.600 --> 23:58.601
