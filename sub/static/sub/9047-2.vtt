- Previously on <i>awkward...</i>

00:03.137 --> 00:05.537
- I was wrapped up
in my cocoon...

00:05.539 --> 00:07.039
My cocoon of matty.

00:07.041 --> 00:08.207
- Jacques!

00:08.209 --> 00:10.509
- Jake and I dtr'ed
last night!

00:10.511 --> 00:12.077
- Ricky is dead to me.

00:12.079 --> 00:18.751
- Ricky schwartz <i>es muerto.</i>

00:18.753 --> 00:20.586
- ♪ to all the girls
I've loved before... ♪

00:20.588 --> 00:23.355
- Death. It was an inevitable
part of life.

00:23.357 --> 00:25.557
And while it was a fate
that awaited us all,

00:25.559 --> 00:27.726
The unexpected death
of ricky schwartz

00:27.728 --> 00:30.195
Was a shock
to everyone's system.

00:30.197 --> 00:34.199
Not to mention, for a ritual
called "sitting shiva,"

00:34.201 --> 00:35.934
We had been doing
a lot of standing.

00:35.936 --> 00:38.003
Unfortunately,
some peeps couldn't help

00:38.005 --> 00:38.704
But lock their knees,

00:38.706 --> 00:42.741
'cause everyone processed loss
in their own way.

00:42.743 --> 00:45.978
For some,
sorrow was externalized openly.

00:45.980 --> 00:48.447
While others,
surprisingly...

00:48.449 --> 00:49.915
Kept it more in check.

00:49.917 --> 00:50.849
- I'm good, thanks.

00:50.851 --> 00:52.418
- There was no right
or wrong way

00:52.420 --> 00:54.520
To react to a death.

00:54.522 --> 00:56.321
Grieving was personal.

00:56.323 --> 00:57.589
- Ricky would've been
truly warmed

00:57.591 --> 00:59.758
By the love you all bring
to this room today.

00:59.760 --> 01:01.093
While he was
an incredibly modest

01:01.095 --> 01:04.163
And humble young man
and a gifted musician,

01:04.165 --> 01:05.230
What many of you didn't know

01:05.232 --> 01:08.167
Was that his real passion
and love was for painting.

01:08.169 --> 01:11.070
His favorite piece,
a colorful self-portrait

01:11.072 --> 01:16.809
Of what he said personified
his inner self.

01:16.811 --> 01:19.144
To me, it's
the perfect reflection

01:19.146 --> 01:22.314
Of his sense
of fun and humor.

01:22.316 --> 01:23.816
- Or his desire
to be a pimp.

01:23.818 --> 01:26.185
- Now, please, join us
in celebrating ricky's life

01:26.187 --> 01:30.989
With a viewing of his artwork
and a smorgasbord.

01:31.825 --> 01:34.259
- Bagels, latke,
cotton candy?

01:34.261 --> 01:35.961
- I'm not hungry.

01:35.963 --> 01:38.564
- Tamara's been totally
uncommunicative lately which,

01:38.566 --> 01:41.266
As you know, is...
Both: Not normal.

01:41.268 --> 01:43.469
- What should I do?
- Nothing.

01:43.471 --> 01:44.369
She's processing,

01:44.371 --> 01:48.540
And probably just trying
to work some things out.

01:48.542 --> 01:49.274
Like ricky.

01:49.276 --> 01:51.810
Apparently he was working
something out too.

01:51.812 --> 01:52.878
- More like rubbing it out.

01:52.880 --> 01:54.546
What's with the latent fixation
on boobs?

01:54.548 --> 01:57.549
- It's not latent,
it's blatant.

01:57.551 --> 01:59.251
Ricky's obsession for breasts

01:59.253 --> 02:02.054
Was apparently homegrown.

02:02.056 --> 02:03.555
- I didn't know
it was possible

02:03.557 --> 02:05.224
To die of an allergic reaction
to peanuts.

02:05.226 --> 02:07.126
Did you know he was allergic?
Me neither.

02:07.128 --> 02:09.360
How could he protected
if he didn't tell anyone?

02:09.363 --> 02:11.964
- How's sadie?
- Pregnant...

02:11.966 --> 02:15.467
With ricky's love child.
- She's not pregnant.

02:15.469 --> 02:19.071
- Did she abort that mission?
- No! She was never pregnant.

02:19.073 --> 02:19.671
She's depressed,

02:19.673 --> 02:21.173
And now things have
only gotten worse.

02:21.175 --> 02:23.909
Which is probably why
she couldn't handle it today.

02:23.911 --> 02:27.179
So have a heart.
Ricky is dead!

02:29.249 --> 02:29.781
- Gefilte fish.

02:29.783 --> 02:31.550
My people say it's good luck

It can protect you
from your dark side.

02:34.355 --> 02:36.188
If you want protection.

Oh, you forgot to tear

02:45.499 --> 02:47.266
- Hey, do you wanna hear
something creepy?

02:47.268 --> 02:49.468
- Creepier than having
my shirt assaulted?

02:49.470 --> 02:50.536
- It's tradition.

02:50.538 --> 02:51.703
So get this,
ricky's grandma

02:51.705 --> 02:55.407
Just told me that ricky was
breast-fed till he was eight.

- [choking]

02:56.243 --> 02:57.142
Are you [bleep]ing me?

02:57.144 --> 02:59.378
It's insane how much
we didn't know about that kid.

02:59.380 --> 03:02.648
- It wasn't insane.
It was understandable.

03:02.650 --> 03:03.615
There were a lot of things

03:03.617 --> 03:05.484
We didn't know
about the people around us,

03:05.486 --> 03:07.653
Including the things matty
didn't know about me.

03:07.655 --> 03:11.223
'cause matty still didn't know
about my pregnancy scare,

03:11.225 --> 03:13.325
And hopefully he never would.

03:13.327 --> 03:16.361
- Girls, don't be angry
or upset.

03:16.363 --> 03:17.996
Ricky's death was an accident.

03:17.998 --> 03:21.466
- But my almost social-death
by pregnancy wasn't.

03:21.468 --> 03:23.535
And to ensure
it never happened again,

03:23.537 --> 03:28.373
I needed to ingest
some good luck...

03:30.543 --> 03:32.544
And maturity.

03:32.546 --> 03:36.615
It was time for me
to be more responsible and...

03:36.617 --> 03:39.618
- Any last words for ricky?

03:41.387 --> 03:44.289
- Responsibility
was a process.

03:51.098 --> 03:53.165
Since the news of ricky's death
by peanut

03:53.167 --> 03:55.300
Had hit the halls
of palos hills.

03:55.302 --> 03:56.435
And by the look of it,

03:56.437 --> 04:00.505
No one was ready to move on
anytime soon.

04:00.507 --> 04:03.342
- Step away from the lockers.

04:03.344 --> 04:04.576
Not you, the fellas.

04:04.578 --> 04:06.278
Are you heartless?

04:06.280 --> 04:07.279
Have a little respect.

04:07.281 --> 04:09.314
- But I can't get to my books.

04:09.316 --> 04:10.983
- You ever think
of how hard it is

04:10.985 --> 04:12.351
For ricky to get to them?

04:12.353 --> 04:13.252
Your buddy is dead.

04:13.254 --> 04:15.387
And you need to think
about the challenges

04:15.389 --> 04:17.356

Oh, my girl.

How are you hanging in there?

04:32.172 --> 04:34.072

- Just fine?

04:34.074 --> 04:36.708
Is that any way to be
after a lover dies?

04:36.710 --> 04:38.277
- Ricky wasn't my lover.

04:38.279 --> 04:39.511
- But I heard he got around.

04:39.513 --> 04:42.281
And well, since we know you do,
I just figured--

- You figured wrong.

- What is this?

04:47.021 --> 04:48.587
- It's for a vigil.

Either way, it should be fun.
- Vigil? I love it.

04:55.529 --> 04:57.029
Where I come from,
a vigil usually means

04:57.031 --> 04:59.698
Someone's burning the body
and grilling some ribs.

04:59.700 --> 05:01.166
- Where you from?

05:01.168 --> 05:03.635
- Missouri.
- Huh. Cool.

05:03.637 --> 05:06.004
Maybe that's
where I'll go to college.

05:06.006 --> 05:09.574
- For teenagers, death took on
different meanings.

05:09.576 --> 05:11.877
For some,
it was a reason to party.

05:11.879 --> 05:14.212
For others...

05:14.214 --> 05:16.948
It was a calling
to commit to a higher power.

05:16.950 --> 05:21.253
And for the rest of us,
it was a time to reflect.

05:21.255 --> 05:22.421
But reflection post-death

05:22.423 --> 05:24.723
Took on all different shapes
and sizes.

05:24.725 --> 05:27.192
And for matty,
it meant fitting his square peg

05:27.194 --> 05:28.026
Into my round hole.

05:28.028 --> 05:31.363
- Oh, hey, maybe we should go
somewhere more private.

matty was yolo-ing.

And while I wanted to celebrate
that I wasn't 16 and pregnant,

05:45.512 --> 05:49.181
Just being 16 meant
I could still get pregnant.

- No!
- Because it's too hard for you?

- No, because

how much pain you're in.

06:46.073 --> 06:48.240
- The only thing pained on me
are my cuticles,

06:48.242 --> 06:50.375
Because I can't afford
my weekly manicures anymore,

06:50.377 --> 06:52.744

- No, no.
Not anymore, man.

08:40.053 --> 08:40.986
Undangle that carrot.

08:40.988 --> 08:43.488
Life is just too short.
- Are you feeling okay?

08:43.490 --> 08:44.956
- Yes, I am.
You know why?

08:44.958 --> 08:46.958
Because I'm alive.

08:46.960 --> 08:50.762
And I [bleep]ing love you.

08:50.764 --> 08:52.797
- [whimpering]

08:52.799 --> 08:53.765
- What's wrong?

08:53.767 --> 08:56.635
- I killed him!
- I know, I saw his face.

08:56.637 --> 08:57.502
He was crushed.

08:57.504 --> 08:59.971
- No, not jake.
Ricky.

08:59.973 --> 09:02.941
I killed ricky schwartz.

09:05.745 --> 09:07.279
- What do you mean,
you "killed ricky?"

09:07.281 --> 09:09.347
- As in I stopped, dropped,
and rolled him into the grave.

09:09.349 --> 09:11.249
I know everybody said
it was an accident,

09:11.251 --> 09:12.017
But I know it wasn't.

09:12.019 --> 09:13.952
It was my fault.
- I don't understand.

09:13.954 --> 09:17.255
How did you--
- with this!

09:17.257 --> 09:19.591
And with these.

09:19.593 --> 09:20.892
I ooodoo-voodooed him.

09:20.894 --> 09:22.027
It's not funny!

09:22.029 --> 09:24.729
I bought over 200
ancient wiccan spells.

09:24.731 --> 09:27.632
- You bought spells? Where?
- On the internet.

09:27.634 --> 09:30.001
At first, I just wanted
to disfigure ricky,

09:30.003 --> 09:31.403
Or make his thyroid
stop working

09:31.405 --> 09:32.671
So he'd get really
[growls] fat.

09:32.673 --> 09:35.574
But then, when I saw him at the
black hearts party with sadie,

09:35.576 --> 09:40.312
I sorta kinda cast a spell
that would make him wanna die.

09:40.314 --> 09:41.379
Jenna!

09:41.381 --> 09:42.547
I might be a witch.

09:42.549 --> 09:44.015
- Drop the "w"
and replace it with a "b,"

09:44.017 --> 09:45.951
Which is just
a fleeting title,

09:45.953 --> 09:47.419
Because you are
a total sweetheart.

09:47.421 --> 09:50.689
Trust me, what you're feeling
is just grief guilt.

09:50.691 --> 09:51.456
And I get it.

09:51.458 --> 09:52.824
But ricky's death
was not your fault.

09:52.826 --> 09:54.793
You had nothing to do with it.
- Really?

09:54.795 --> 09:57.295
- Really.
- So I'm not gonna rot in hell?

09:57.297 --> 09:59.331
- Unlikely.
- But possible?

09:59.333 --> 10:00.565
- No, no.

10:00.567 --> 10:02.467
- Okay.
Thank you.

10:02.469 --> 10:03.401
I needed that.

10:03.403 --> 10:04.402
Now if you'll excuse me,

10:04.404 --> 10:07.772
I'm still at defcon one,
and I need to walk it off.

10:07.774 --> 10:11.176
- As tamara walked off
her feelings of guilt,

10:11.178 --> 10:12.577
Mine were left unchecked.

10:12.579 --> 10:13.778
Was I being too hard
on myself

10:13.780 --> 10:16.114
To bear the full brunt
of responsibility

10:16.116 --> 10:17.849
For my close call
with parenthood?

10:17.851 --> 10:20.118
Maybe I needed some consoling
for myself.

10:20.120 --> 10:23.288
Val's office hours
were at an all-time high.

10:23.290 --> 10:25.624
Every kid wanted to share
their anxiety

10:25.626 --> 10:29.527
And/or use ricky's death
as an excuse to get out of p.E.

10:29.529 --> 10:32.130
Either way, it was an annoying
misuse of the system,

10:32.132 --> 10:35.934
Because I was relegated
to the back of the line.

10:35.936 --> 10:37.502
- It's gonna be okay.

10:37.504 --> 10:41.039
No one ever died
getting touched by their uncle.

10:41.041 --> 10:43.108
My girl!
[whispering] get up here.

10:43.110 --> 10:45.243
Hey, hey, hey.
Hold up.

10:45.245 --> 10:46.611
Don't be haters.

10:46.613 --> 10:47.479
Jenna had a reservation.

10:47.481 --> 10:51.149
Yeah, I know
there's a list, scott.

10:51.151 --> 10:52.217
But she used invisible ink.

10:52.219 --> 10:54.252
It's how I maintain
confidentiality.

10:54.254 --> 10:55.720
Believe me,
you'll appreciate it

10:55.722 --> 10:58.757
When you need to go
black ops one day too.

10:58.759 --> 11:00.458
How you hanging in there?

11:00.460 --> 11:01.826
Is ricky's death bringing up

11:01.828 --> 11:03.094
Some intense stuff for you?

11:03.096 --> 11:04.629
- Actually,
in a weird way, it is.

11:04.631 --> 11:07.032
- Are you being safe?
- Funny you should ask.

11:07.034 --> 11:09.601
That's sort of why I'm here.

11:09.603 --> 11:10.835
- Can you hold up your arms?

11:10.837 --> 11:12.904
- Oh, okay.
Why?

11:12.906 --> 11:14.839
- I just want 'em to stay
where I can see them,

11:14.841 --> 11:16.941
So we don't have
any more...Accidents.

11:16.943 --> 11:18.977
- Are you suggesting
that ricky's death

11:18.979 --> 11:19.944
Wasn't an accident?

11:19.946 --> 11:21.112
- I'm not suggesting anything.

11:21.114 --> 11:25.116
I-I just don't want any more
blood spilled on my watch.

11:25.118 --> 11:25.817
Or carpet.

11:25.819 --> 11:27.719
Especially since
it just got steam cleaned,

11:27.721 --> 11:28.953
Which took months
to get approved.

11:28.955 --> 11:31.589
[scoffs] district budgets
are retarded.

11:31.591 --> 11:33.124
Anywho, so break it down.

11:33.126 --> 11:36.161
Or break down.
You can cry in here.

11:36.163 --> 11:37.462
- I don't really wanna cry.

11:37.464 --> 11:41.700
I just wanna talk about
how I've been blaming myself

11:41.702 --> 11:43.535
For a little
sexual indiscretion.

11:43.537 --> 11:45.203
- With ricky?
- No!

11:45.205 --> 11:46.571
I wasn't involved
with ricky,

11:46.573 --> 11:49.174
Except for this one super drunk
and drugged moment

11:49.176 --> 11:50.542
We had at a party.

11:50.544 --> 11:51.643
- Were you guys free basing?

11:51.645 --> 11:56.715
- No! That story isn't
really relevant to why I'm here.

11:56.717 --> 11:57.916
I wanna talk
about matty and me.

11:57.918 --> 12:01.553
- Okay, but where does ricky
fit into this equation?

12:01.555 --> 12:02.787
- He doesn't.

12:02.789 --> 12:05.056
- Then why are you
in my office?

12:05.058 --> 12:06.024
[scoffs]

12:06.026 --> 12:07.759
There are people
waiting outside

12:07.761 --> 12:09.060
To talk about a dead person,

12:09.062 --> 12:12.130
And you wanna talk
about yourself?

12:12.132 --> 12:13.965
Shame on you, jenna.

12:13.967 --> 12:16.801
Shame...On...You.

12:19.472 --> 12:23.007
Kids, I'm making
an announcement.

12:23.009 --> 12:27.746
I am downgrading myself
from vp...

12:27.748 --> 12:28.747
To gc.

12:28.749 --> 12:29.748
What this tragedy has proved

12:29.750 --> 12:34.085
Is that you all need me to be
more selfless for all of you.

12:34.087 --> 12:37.856
Whoever buys me a candy bar
can go next.

12:37.858 --> 12:41.793
See, jenna, not everything
has to be about you.

12:41.795 --> 12:43.061
- Val made a good point.

12:43.063 --> 12:46.131
Not everything was about me.
- Yeah, you, let's go.

12:46.133 --> 12:47.031
- It took two to tango,

12:47.033 --> 12:50.001
And it was time to rationally
explain that to matty.

12:50.003 --> 12:51.202
You need to stop being
so horny.

12:51.204 --> 12:53.271
I am not just some lady
of the afternoon,

12:53.273 --> 12:54.172
And I am more than just

12:54.174 --> 12:56.141
Your personal
jolly juice receptacle, matty.

12:56.143 --> 12:56.841
- I know.

12:56.843 --> 12:58.143
- And I don't wanna
start thinking

12:58.145 --> 12:59.444
About being an adult
right now,

12:59.446 --> 13:01.112
Or dealing with my own issues
of life and death.

13:01.114 --> 13:02.113
Following?
- Sort of.

13:02.115 --> 13:04.149
- Good, because I need to know
that you are in this for me

13:04.151 --> 13:06.851
And not just
my...Funhouse.

13:06.853 --> 13:10.021
[car horn honks]

13:10.023 --> 13:11.689
I have to go.

13:11.691 --> 13:12.724
But before the vigil tonight,

13:12.726 --> 13:17.695
You need to ruminate
on the error of your ways.

13:17.697 --> 13:20.865
- What the hell is going on
with these girls?

13:23.435 --> 13:25.670
- Honey, it's okay.

13:25.672 --> 13:27.105
Nothing to be nervous about.

13:27.107 --> 13:28.006
You get on that table,

13:28.008 --> 13:29.808
You put your legs
in the stirrups,

13:29.810 --> 13:32.076
And once they crank you open,

13:32.078 --> 13:33.511
The swabbing happens
lickety-split.

13:33.513 --> 13:35.246
- What are they gonna swab?
- Your cervix.

13:35.248 --> 13:37.916
It's standard,
uncomfortable.

13:37.918 --> 13:39.651
But you only have
to do it once a year.

13:39.653 --> 13:40.919
- Every year?
- Mm-hmm.

13:40.921 --> 13:42.520
- They can't just give me
the pill?

13:42.522 --> 13:44.589
- Mm-mm.
- Maybe we should go.

13:44.591 --> 13:45.990
I'll just tell matty
about the scare,

13:45.992 --> 13:47.458
And we can be extra careful.

13:47.460 --> 13:48.726
- No, no. No.

13:48.728 --> 13:49.894
You can't tell him.

13:49.896 --> 13:51.029
He's 16 and a boy.

13:51.031 --> 13:52.664
He can't deal with that info.

13:52.666 --> 13:54.966
- But why should I be the one
to bear all the responsibility?

13:54.968 --> 13:56.167
- Because you're a girl.
- So?

13:56.169 --> 13:59.137
- It's our burden as girls
to be the vigilant ones,

13:59.139 --> 14:02.440
Because it's our bodies
that bear the fruits of labor.

14:02.442 --> 14:04.876
- I know, but--
- but nothing.

14:04.878 --> 14:06.477
If you wanna have sex,

14:06.479 --> 14:08.012
Then you, as the girl,

14:08.014 --> 14:10.448
Have to take all the risk
and precautions.

14:10.450 --> 14:13.918
The safety checks are yours
and yours alone.

14:13.920 --> 14:17.755
And it doesn't mean that you
have to stop being young

14:17.757 --> 14:18.489
Or loving matty.

14:18.491 --> 14:22.093
It just means you have
to take control of your destiny

14:22.095 --> 14:23.595
And your body,

14:23.597 --> 14:25.496
Because...

14:25.498 --> 14:27.866
Boys don't get pregnant.

14:27.868 --> 14:29.467
Girls do.

14:29.469 --> 14:31.502
Always protect yourself.

14:31.504 --> 14:33.171
- It was exactly what
I needed to hear.

14:33.173 --> 14:36.174
I didn't need
to blame matty or myself.

14:36.176 --> 14:37.775
I just needed to take action.

14:37.777 --> 14:40.044
Sometimes
my mother was astounding

14:40.046 --> 14:44.616
And could surprise me
with wisdom.

14:44.618 --> 14:46.784
That she'd read off a wall.

14:46.786 --> 14:49.821
[rock music]

14:49.823 --> 14:53.625
- Thanks.

14:53.627 --> 14:55.026
- I'm not gonna say anything.
- Why?

14:55.028 --> 14:58.062
- Because I'm worried
that no matter what I say,

14:58.064 --> 14:59.530
It's the wrong thing.

14:59.532 --> 15:00.131
- I'm sorry.

15:00.133 --> 15:02.634
I've just been going through
all these weird emotions.

15:02.636 --> 15:05.570
And freaking out about--
- us?

15:05.572 --> 15:08.006
- Maybe. Yeah.

15:08.008 --> 15:09.073
- Well...

15:09.075 --> 15:10.675
You don't have to.

15:10.677 --> 15:13.645
Because I want you to know
that this thing

15:13.647 --> 15:14.412
Is not just sex.

15:14.414 --> 15:16.915
And to prove it, I want
to show you something.

15:16.917 --> 15:20.051
Close your eyes.
- Doesn't that defeat the point?

15:20.053 --> 15:21.686
- Just keep 'em closed.

15:21.688 --> 15:23.655
[zipper rasps]
- oh! Hey!

15:23.657 --> 15:25.490
Hey! What are you doing?
- [bleep]

15:25.492 --> 15:27.525
- I thought you said
this wasn't about sex.

15:27.527 --> 15:29.527
- No, no, no, no! It's not.

15:29.529 --> 15:30.561
Hold on.

15:30.563 --> 15:32.797
Look!

15:32.799 --> 15:33.798
Heh?

15:33.800 --> 15:34.866
- You got a tattoo?
- Yeah.

15:34.868 --> 15:38.536
And I had them face it
towards me so I can look at it.

15:38.538 --> 15:41.873
- That is so weird.
- Awesome.

15:41.875 --> 15:42.874
- [laughs]

15:42.876 --> 15:46.911
- Okay. Yeah, maybe it's
a little impulsive

15:46.913 --> 15:49.080
And incredibly irresponsible.

15:49.082 --> 15:51.182
- Matty was proving
his affection

15:51.184 --> 15:53.851
In the most permanent way
possible.

15:53.853 --> 15:54.986
I love it.

15:54.988 --> 15:58.656
And you.

15:58.658 --> 16:02.760
- So we'll put the brakes on
for a little bit.

16:02.762 --> 16:04.896
- It doesn't have to be
too long.

16:04.898 --> 16:08.700
Just seven to ten days.

16:08.702 --> 16:09.100
- What?

16:09.102 --> 16:12.136
- Oh, you know, like
the commercials say,

16:12.138 --> 16:15.840
"one a day,
keeps the baby away."

16:15.842 --> 16:18.876
- Oh. Yes.

16:18.878 --> 16:21.412
- So I really didn't know ricky,

16:21.414 --> 16:22.480
But I felt him.

16:22.482 --> 16:23.748
These are his ashes.

16:23.750 --> 16:25.116
He's charred, top to bottom.

16:25.118 --> 16:26.851
I'm gonna pass him around.

16:26.853 --> 16:29.721
Feel free
to snort a little of him.

16:29.723 --> 16:31.222
It was epic.

16:31.224 --> 16:34.559
The mic is now free
if anyone would like to talk.

16:34.561 --> 16:35.994
Anyone?

16:35.996 --> 16:36.961
- I would.

16:36.963 --> 16:38.663
[crowd ohs]

16:38.665 --> 16:42.300
[eerie music]

16:42.302 --> 16:44.435
I have a confession to make.

16:49.908 --> 16:50.808
- I...

16:50.810 --> 16:52.176
- This is gonna be good.

16:52.178 --> 16:54.145
- Hated ricky schwartz.

16:54.147 --> 16:56.581
He was a cheater
and a liar.

16:56.583 --> 16:59.484
And I wanted him to die.

16:59.486 --> 17:01.152
I prayed for him to die.

17:01.154 --> 17:03.888
And I thought about it
every day.

17:03.890 --> 17:05.589
I even once paid someone money

17:05.592 --> 17:10.194
To cast a spell on him
so that he would die.

17:10.195 --> 17:11.596
