WEBVTT

00:01.400 --> 00:02.899
Previously on the 4400...

00:04.867 --> 00:06.238
We're not sure what's just happened.

00:06.291 --> 00:07.076
The light is gone.

00:07.086 --> 00:09.341
And thousands of people
have just suddenly appeared.

00:09.387 --> 00:11.581
Some of them have been missing over 60 years.

00:11.582 --> 00:13.891
None of them have any memory
of what happened to them.

00:13.895 --> 00:14.857
I saw your brother.

00:15.998 --> 00:16.726
Shawn?

00:17.075 --> 00:19.155
You know those visions that maia used to have.

00:19.333 --> 00:21.919
It turns out she was only
pretending that they stopped.

00:21.969 --> 00:23.304
Don't give me that look, tom.

00:23.305 --> 00:25.867
You kept shawn's ability to yourself for quite some time.

00:25.868 --> 00:29.237
I've cured emphysema, leukemia...

00:29.325 --> 00:31.200
I don't get why these attacks keep coming back.

00:31.201 --> 00:32.639
That baby really kicked your ass.

00:32.704 --> 00:34.089
Heidi, it's mommy.

00:34.478 --> 00:35.252
Who?

00:35.257 --> 00:36.674
I have another family now, and I'm sorry.

00:36.675 --> 00:38.528
I know that's not fair to you, but...

00:38.529 --> 00:40.375
brian, I am still part of your life.

00:40.376 --> 00:41.936
If you're losing chunks of time,

00:41.940 --> 00:43.659
you should talk to your dad about it.

00:43.660 --> 00:46.106
You told me everything that happened that night, right?

00:46.107 --> 00:46.794
Yeah.

00:59.117 --> 01:00.557
It's okay, it's okay.

01:00.825 --> 01:01.562
Jordan.

01:16.186 --> 01:18.416
You don't have to keep vigil, shawn.

01:18.553 --> 01:20.819
Are you going to cancel the appearance at riverfront park?

01:20.820 --> 01:22.263
No. That would be a mistake.

01:22.264 --> 01:23.617
They're not just honoring me.

01:24.103 --> 01:26.676
They're honoring the center and all the work we've done.

01:28.304 --> 01:31.738
- A new neurological clinic just opened in atlanta.
- No, look, look.

01:31.766 --> 01:34.908
I've been to all the specialists, shawn.

01:35.073 --> 01:36.646
There's no name for what I have.

01:36.880 --> 01:38.141
We can't just give up.

01:38.252 --> 01:40.668
There's got to be a way to
figure out what that baby did to you.

01:40.670 --> 01:42.222
I know what that baby did to me.

01:42.223 --> 01:43.344
It saved my life.

01:44.429 --> 01:44.940
What?

01:45.175 --> 01:46.107
What are you talking about?

01:46.382 --> 01:49.633
When I touched lily's pregnant
belly and was hit with that pain

01:49.634 --> 01:52.363
I realized I'd been judged and found wanting.

01:52.364 --> 01:55.743
- By a baby that wasn't even born yet?
- In that moment...

01:58.010 --> 02:00.501
I was forced to see the truth about myself,

02:00.527 --> 02:03.104
about my motives toward the 4400,

02:03.832 --> 02:05.897
and they were... not pure.

02:05.972 --> 02:07.626
That baby tried to kill you.

02:08.062 --> 02:09.282
And it succeeded.

02:10.262 --> 02:12.086
It killed the old jordan collier,

02:12.299 --> 02:15.632
and I was reborn,

02:16.619 --> 02:17.888
pure of purpose.

02:18.982 --> 02:20.322
All I've done since,

02:20.399 --> 02:21.525
everything I've built,

02:21.528 --> 02:22.819
I owe to richard,

02:23.524 --> 02:27.602
to lily... and to that child.

02:32.047 --> 02:32.895
I'll get it.

02:40.345 --> 02:41.766
- Hey.
- Hi.

02:42.681 --> 02:44.184
Come in. Lily...

02:44.993 --> 02:45.916
Iook who's here.

02:48.168 --> 02:49.277
We would have called,

02:49.278 --> 02:51.055
but heidi wanted to surprise you.

02:52.478 --> 02:53.242
Heidi...

02:53.645 --> 02:54.680
hi, mom.

02:55.844 --> 02:57.004
She's so cute.

02:57.008 --> 02:58.652
Now that you guys are living on the block,

02:58.916 --> 03:01.143
I figured it was time for heidi to meet her real mom.

03:01.764 --> 03:03.406
That makes you my second dad.

03:04.211 --> 03:05.054
I guess so.

03:05.847 --> 03:07.218
Mom, why are you crying?

03:07.219 --> 03:08.514
Lily, are you all right?

03:09.623 --> 03:10.512
- Lily?
- Lily?

03:12.699 --> 03:14.100
Lily?

03:16.201 --> 03:17.004
Lily?

03:18.053 --> 03:19.146
Sweetheart, wake up.

03:25.463 --> 03:26.425
It was a dream...

03:26.575 --> 03:27.899
more like a nightmare.

03:29.376 --> 03:30.561
No, no.

03:31.703 --> 03:33.510
We were living next door to heidi and brian,

03:34.155 --> 03:36.104
and we were all getting along.
And the house...

03:36.679 --> 03:38.158
richard, it was so pretty.

03:38.277 --> 03:39.413
So why were you crying?

03:42.417 --> 03:43.899
I guess I knew it wasn't real.

03:47.698 --> 03:50.493
How long can we keep going
before someone catches up to us?

03:51.700 --> 03:53.337
We just got to keep moving,

03:53.507 --> 03:55.438
stay ahead of collier and ntac.

03:57.304 --> 03:59.245
I'm just so tired of running.

03:59.533 --> 04:01.470
We're going to find a place to stop running.

04:02.381 --> 04:03.430
It's out there...

04:03.497 --> 04:04.647
got to be.

04:52.574 --> 04:54.394
That's good.

04:54.405 --> 04:55.416
You've come so far.

04:59.543 --> 05:01.031
Nice use of color.

05:07.272 --> 05:09.050
It's shaping up, greg,

05:09.281 --> 05:11.388
but I think it could use some work.

05:13.143 --> 05:14.636
That's as good as it gets.

05:26.535 --> 05:27.757
Don't waste your time.

05:42.625 --> 05:43.629
Ms. Tobey,

05:44.403 --> 05:45.777
would you come with us, please?

05:48.600 --> 05:49.404
Harmon.

05:49.841 --> 05:50.556
Harmon...

05:51.280 --> 05:52.379
sam...

05:52.566 --> 05:53.786
what's this all about?

05:53.949 --> 05:56.238
Ms. Tobey, I'm placing you under arrest.

05:56.432 --> 05:57.391
Arrest?

05:58.399 --> 05:59.048
For what?

05:59.305 --> 06:00.203
Child abuse.

06:00.695 --> 06:02.310
Oh, my god. What...

06:20.804 --> 06:25.834
<i>So long ago, another life</i>

06:25.922 --> 06:29.822
<i>I can feel your heart beat</i>

06:30.304 --> 06:35.160
<i>it's not a dream remember us</i>

06:35.529 --> 06:39.416
<i>I can see it in your eyes</i>

06:39.424 --> 06:42.928
<i>we'll find our place in time</i>

06:42.939 --> 06:47.556
<i>our place in time beyond the sun</i>

06:48.566 --> 06:52.461
<i>we'll find our place in time</i>

06:52.473 --> 06:57.527
<i>our place in time to call our own</i>

07:16.300 --> 07:16.900
Look

07:17.000 --> 07:19.600
I know his birth certificate says the kid's 21.

07:19.700 --> 07:22.900
But emotionally kyle is still a teenager.

07:23.000 --> 07:27.500
I've got to accept the fact that he's 
gonna screw up like a teenager.

07:27.800 --> 07:29.000
He'll learn from his mistakes.

07:29.100 --> 07:31.200
Get it out of his system.

07:31.300 --> 07:33.400
But shawn...

07:33.500 --> 07:35.500
it's been a year.

07:35.800 --> 07:38.400
How could he cut us out like that?

07:38.500 --> 07:41.800
And danny. He's eating himself up inside.

07:41.900 --> 07:44.500
He used to be such a sweet boy.

07:45.400 --> 07:47.900
Yeah. I remember what pop used to say...

07:48.000 --> 07:49.100
"you think you've got problems?

07:49.200 --> 07:51.500
Wait till you become a parent.

07:52.100 --> 07:54.200
Little did we know.

07:54.300 --> 07:55.600
Yeah.

07:55.700 --> 07:57.900
What do you want to bet they're talking about us downstairs?

07:58.000 --> 07:59.800
That's what they live for.

07:59.900 --> 08:03.000
If they didn't have us to worry about. They'd die of boredom.

08:03.300 --> 08:05.000
I've seen you around campus.

08:05.100 --> 08:06.600
I saw you too.

08:06.700 --> 08:08.600
Why didn't you say something?

08:08.700 --> 08:10.300
It's been. Like. Four years.

08:10.400 --> 08:11.300
I mean. What was I supposed to say.

08:11.400 --> 08:13.900
"Welcome back from coma worid"?

08:15.200 --> 08:16.800
I don't know. I guess

08:16.900 --> 08:18.900
seeing you reminded me of shawn.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.200
You two were always so tight.

08:21.300 --> 08:23.300
And you were like our shadow...

08:23.400 --> 08:25.700
"where you going? Can I come too?"

08:25.800 --> 08:28.200
I thought you guys were so cool.

08:28.900 --> 08:31.600
I was 14.What did I know?

08:35.299 --> 08:37.600
Mom says you talked to him?

08:38.400 --> 08:40.900
I don't think he heard me.

08:41.000 --> 08:42.600
You know.

08:44.000 --> 08:46.100
I used to blame shawn for everything...

08:46.200 --> 08:48.200
stealing nikki.

08:48.300 --> 08:49.900
Running out on us the way he did.

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
Breaking mom's heart.

08:52.800 --> 08:54.800
But it wasn't his fault.

08:56.000 --> 08:59.300
And the bastards who took him sent him back a freak.

08:59.600 --> 09:01.100
They're the ones.

09:01.200 --> 09:03.900
Guess they screwed us all up.

09:05.700 --> 09:11.300
Well. I want to thank councilman lowe on 
behalf of the 4400 center for this wonderful honor.

09:17.300 --> 09:19.800
In funding this cleanup project.

09:19.900 --> 09:26.500
I wanted to pay tribute not only to the 
glories of the past but to the promise of the future.

09:26.501 --> 09:28.600
I believe that the actions we take.

09:28.700 --> 09:30.800
The choices we make

09:30.900 --> 09:36.800
will create the kind of future that 
we and our children and their children will live in.

09:36.900 --> 09:38.600
Thank you.

09:43.700 --> 09:44.200
Hey.

09:44.300 --> 09:44.900
Hey!

09:45.000 --> 09:45.800
What?

09:45.900 --> 09:47.300
Get your hands off of me.

09:47.400 --> 09:48.800
What do you want to do. Break it?

09:48.900 --> 09:49.404
Stop it!

09:49.439 --> 09:50.400
Hey! What's the deal?

09:50.500 --> 09:51.600
These people don't belong here.

09:51.700 --> 09:53.500
No. You're the ones who don't belong here.

09:53.600 --> 09:58.000
This used to be our home until you scumbags 
decided to make everything beautiful and kicked us out.

09:58.100 --> 09:59.000
It's okay. You can let 'em go.

09:59.100 --> 10:00.600
They were stealing food.

10:00.700 --> 10:02.600
Well. Last time I checked. The food was free.

10:02.700 --> 10:03.600
Don't make me pull rank.

10:03.700 --> 10:04.700
Come on.

10:04.800 --> 10:05.700
Yes. Sir. Mr. Farrell.

10:05.800 --> 10:06.410
Thank you.

10:09.200 --> 10:10.600
Big shot. Huh?

10:10.700 --> 10:12.300
I'm impressed.

10:12.400 --> 10:14.000
I'm really sorry that we trashed your home.

10:14.100 --> 10:15.000
I am.

10:15.100 --> 10:16.400
You should be.

10:16.500 --> 10:20.800
It's a hell of a lot warmer here than
 crashing near l-90 bridge.

10:21.200 --> 10:23.000
Food's still free. Right?

10:23.100 --> 10:24.200
Yes. Absolutely.

10:24.300 --> 10:25.500
Please be my guest.

10:25.600 --> 10:27.400
Yeah. We will.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.200
Protect the future. Huh?

10:31.300 --> 10:33.700
Got to have one first.

10:35.700 --> 10:38.800
Even on the map. Fairview seems far away.

10:38.900 --> 10:42.100
That's four hours tops.

10:42.200 --> 10:45.300
This is my first time spending the night away from maia.

10:45.400 --> 10:47.200
Isn't your sister with her?

10:47.300 --> 10:49.500
The one with all the tattoos?

10:50.000 --> 10:51.100
Sorry.

10:51.200 --> 10:55.100
Those beer kegs kyle ordered 
should be showing up right about now.

10:55.200 --> 10:57.300
Yeah. You read these charges?

10:57.400 --> 11:00.200
"Teacher is accused of reckless endangerment.

11:00.300 --> 11:03.200
Placing her students' health. Welfare. 
And safety at risk.

11:03.300 --> 11:04.900
"Could that be any more vague?

11:05.000 --> 11:08.600
Well. That could be anything from grabbing them 
on the arms to touching them on the privates.

11:08.700 --> 11:10.500
Or maybe she did nothing.

11:10.600 --> 11:13.000
Yeah."Nothing" would be my vote.

11:13.100 --> 11:15.600
A 4400 serial killer was bad enough.

11:15.700 --> 11:18.400
But a 4400 child molester?

11:23.100 --> 11:24.500
You're damn right we don't want her back!

11:24.600 --> 11:25.800
Not now. Not ever.

11:25.900 --> 11:26.900
Look.

11:27.000 --> 11:28.700
I don't know what's going to happen with ms. Tobey.

11:28.800 --> 11:29.600
She's out on bail. Right?

11:29.700 --> 11:30.000
That's right.

11:30.100 --> 11:32.095
And her bond was paid by
parents from this school.

11:32.096 --> 11:33.400
Yeah. And if they're not worried about their kids.

11:33.500 --> 11:34.500
Then we'll worry for them.

11:34.600 --> 11:36.000
Ask sal here. He'll tell you.

11:36.100 --> 11:37.100
His kid was abused.

11:37.200 --> 11:39.100
Same as melinda and teddy.

11:39.200 --> 11:40.500
What about your child. Mr...

11:40.600 --> 11:42.700
Venner. Frank venner.

11:42.800 --> 11:44.600
It's not like she didn't try with my boy.

11:44.700 --> 11:46.500
Greg just happened to be one of the lucky ones.

11:46.600 --> 11:47.300
Tried what?

11:47.400 --> 11:48.500
Now. Who the hell are you two?

11:48.600 --> 11:50.300
I'm agent skouris. This is agent baldwin.

11:50.400 --> 11:51.600
We're with ntac.

11:51.700 --> 11:52.400
Great.

11:52.500 --> 11:53.400
You got here just in time.

11:53.500 --> 11:54.700
Yeah. Cops let her go.

11:54.800 --> 11:58.400
You can take her to quarantine or stick her back in jail.

11:58.500 --> 12:00.300
She hasn't been found guilty of anything yet.

12:00.400 --> 12:02.800
She's a 4400.isn't she?

12:02.900 --> 12:06.200
She should never have been allowed 
back in this school in the first place.

12:06.300 --> 12:08.200
According to the preliminary exams.

12:08.300 --> 12:10.500
None of the kids showed any signs of abuse.

12:10.600 --> 12:12.300
No marks. No bruises?

12:12.400 --> 12:13.600
No physical signs. At any rate.

12:13.700 --> 12:16.200
So what are we talking about? Some kind of mental abuse?

12:16.300 --> 12:17.800
Personally. I'm not convinced it's abuse at all.

12:17.900 --> 12:20.400
But there's no denying that some of 
her students have been changed.

12:20.500 --> 12:21.300
Changed?

12:21.400 --> 12:23.100
In what way?

12:34.600 --> 12:36.700
That was beautiful.

12:36.900 --> 12:38.000
I guess.

12:38.100 --> 12:41.900
You're telling me two weeks ago 
you'd never played a violin.

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
Never even touched one.

12:44.400 --> 12:50.700
Hey. I only took this class 'cause
art appreciation's supposed to be a guaranteed "A.

12:50.800 --> 12:53.700
You're supposed to learn about dead painters and stuff.

12:53.800 --> 12:55.000
It's so cool.

12:55.100 --> 12:56.000
I look at a bunch of clay.

12:56.100 --> 12:57.400
I see the figure I want to mold.

12:57.500 --> 13:01.600
I just carve away the pieces
I don't need and there it is.

13:01.700 --> 13:03.600
You should see the way she stares at you.

13:03.700 --> 13:05.100
It's like she's drilling a hole.

13:05.200 --> 13:06.900
Trying to get in there and rearrange your brain.

13:07.000 --> 13:09.100
One minute. She was touching my shoulder.

13:09.200 --> 13:10.900
The next thing I remember. She was handing me a violin.

13:11.000 --> 13:16.500
And I'm standing there wondering what the
hell am I doing with a paintbrush in my hand.

13:16.600 --> 13:18.700
And then I see this block of clay.

13:18.800 --> 13:20.200
And it was like.

13:20.300 --> 13:21.800
"Where have you been all my life?

13:21.900 --> 13:26.800
"My dad's big dream was to get me a football scholarship.

13:27.000 --> 13:29.800
It used to be my dream. Too.

13:29.900 --> 13:32.900
But this painting stuff.

13:33.000 --> 13:33.800
I'm really into it now.

13:33.900 --> 13:35.800
Ms. Tobey's the best teacher I ever had in my life.

13:35.900 --> 13:38.400
My dad says these kids may seem normal now.

13:38.500 --> 13:39.900
But in. Like. Two years.

13:40.000 --> 13:44.100
They might develop brain tumors. Go blind. Crazy.

13:44.200 --> 13:46.500
Who knows?

13:46.600 --> 13:49.000
You guys should throw her back in jail.

13:49.100 --> 13:50.100
Your dad.

13:50.200 --> 13:53.900
He wouldn't be frank venner. By any chance. Would he?

13:54.000 --> 13:55.600
How'd you know?

13:55.700 --> 13:57.500
Oh. Just...

13:57.600 --> 13:58.900
a wild guess.

13:59.000 --> 14:00.700
Hurt my students?

14:00.800 --> 14:02.200
That's so ridiculous.

14:02.300 --> 14:05.700
Well. It's not ridiculous to these parents.

14:05.800 --> 14:08.200
People get scared when they don't recognize their kids.

14:08.300 --> 14:10.700
But they're still the same kids.

14:10.800 --> 14:14.300
I just find what's already inside them and help bring it out.

14:14.400 --> 14:16.400
How do you do that?

14:17.300 --> 14:18.900
I study them.

14:19.000 --> 14:20.141
Sometimes.

14:20.142 --> 14:21.761
There's a light in their eyes.

14:22.100 --> 14:24.200
Like a tiny flame.

14:24.300 --> 14:25.600
And while I'm watching.

14:25.700 --> 14:27.600
It gets brighter.

14:27.700 --> 14:29.800
That's when I know there's something in them.

14:29.900 --> 14:32.500
Something beautiful.

14:32.600 --> 14:35.712
So this light. Have you seen it in anyone else?

14:36.300 --> 14:38.400
It doesn't seem to work with grownups.

14:38.500 --> 14:41.000
It doesn't work with every kid. Either.

14:41.100 --> 14:43.400
Like this one boy. Greg venner.

14:43.500 --> 14:44.600
I keep looking.

14:44.700 --> 14:45.900
But so far...

14:46.000 --> 14:49.400
I think his father's pretty adamant that you stop looking.

14:49.500 --> 14:51.300
Frank?

14:51.400 --> 14:52.700
I taught frank.

14:52.800 --> 14:55.800
He was one of my first students back in '72.

14:55.900 --> 14:56.900
The fact is.

14:57.000 --> 15:00.300
I probably taught half the parents who are out to get me.

15:00.400 --> 15:01.500
This is crazy.

15:01.600 --> 15:04.800
L... I haven't done anything wrong.

15:04.900 --> 15:07.000
I need to get back to my kids.

15:07.100 --> 15:09.200
The people who took me.

15:09.300 --> 15:13.200
It can't be an accident they gave me this wonderful gift.

15:13.300 --> 15:15.500
That's why they sent me back.

15:15.600 --> 15:17.800
To use it.

16:24.300 --> 16:25.900
Tyler?

16:35.900 --> 16:37.600
Richard tyler?

16:46.200 --> 16:48.000
Richard tyler.

16:49.100 --> 16:51.400
Yes. I'm richard tyler.

16:58.600 --> 17:02.300
As wind carved the lung feel like 10 hours,
what've we got show for it?

17:02.400 --> 17:03.800
Less than 20 bucks

17:03.900 --> 17:05.099
what we ganna do?

17:05.200 --> 17:06.300
Gotta make it lived

17:06.400 --> 17:07.700
who's got this

17:07.800 --> 17:09.400
no one friends treat

17:09.500 --> 17:10.599
Hey. Shawn.

17:10.700 --> 17:11.599
Iook who showed.

17:11.700 --> 17:12.599
I was in the mood for pizza.

17:12.700 --> 17:14.000
I didn't feel like eating alone.

17:14.099 --> 17:14.599
So...

17:14.700 --> 17:18.000
my very own fairy godfather.

17:19.099 --> 17:23.200
Or are you just some rich boy looking to 
rent some down-and-dirty for the night?

17:23.300 --> 17:24.599
I'm not here for that.

17:24.700 --> 17:27.099
What's the matter? Am I not good enough for you?

17:27.200 --> 17:29.700
Maybe I'm not good enough for you.

17:30.200 --> 17:32.200
I can get behind that.

17:33.200 --> 17:35.700
Yo. Wayne. Pepperoni.

17:40.400 --> 17:41.300
You going to stand there and watch.

17:41.400 --> 17:43.500
Or you going to sit down and eat?

17:47.800 --> 17:48.400
Hello?

17:48.500 --> 17:49.900
Brian.

17:50.300 --> 17:51.500
It's me. Lily.

17:51.600 --> 17:53.000
Lily. Where are you?

17:53.100 --> 17:56.500
You know. Ntac's been calling me all summer trying to find you.

17:57.600 --> 17:58.700
Brian. Iook.

17:58.800 --> 18:00.300
I need your help.

18:00.400 --> 18:03.000
Richard¡£¡£¡£he's been arrested.

18:03.100 --> 18:04.600
Ou're a lawyer.

18:04.700 --> 18:06.900
I need you to call the sheriff's office in weldon. Idaho.

18:07.000 --> 18:08.000
See what you can find out.

18:08.100 --> 18:09.300
Well. I don't know what I can do for the guy.

18:09.400 --> 18:11.500
I'm not a criminal lawyer.

18:11.700 --> 18:13.000
Brian. If you don't want to help...

18:13.100 --> 18:14.400
I swear to god. Lily.

18:14.500 --> 18:15.800
You disappear for over a year.

18:15.900 --> 18:18.900
And then you call me up with these stories 
about the police arresting your boyfriend...

18:18.901 --> 18:21.200
richard's my husband.

18:21.400 --> 18:23.100
We have a child.

18:23.200 --> 18:25.600
A six-month-old girl.

18:29.500 --> 18:31.300
How's heidi?

18:32.200 --> 18:33.700
She's good.

18:33.800 --> 18:36.400
Started seventh grade and...

18:36.500 --> 18:38.700
aced her first semester.

18:39.000 --> 18:40.800
That's wonderful.

18:42.500 --> 18:43.900
Brian.

18:44.000 --> 18:45.000
I'm sorry to be bothering you with this.

18:45.100 --> 18:48.600
But I have nowhere else to turn.

18:51.400 --> 18:54.700
Okay. I'll make a few calls and do whatever I can.

18:59.000 --> 18:59.900
I got to admit.

19:00.000 --> 19:03.300
The first time mike came home with 
that violin and started playing.

19:03.400 --> 19:05.600
His mom and me. We were both a little spooked.

19:05.700 --> 19:07.400
So why did you help pay heather's bail?

19:07.500 --> 19:10.000
I would've paid the whole thing if I could've afforded it.

19:10.100 --> 19:12.800
My wife. She shot a video of mike playing.

19:12.900 --> 19:14.700
Sent it over to the conservatory.

19:14.800 --> 19:16.400
Next day. They called back.

19:16.500 --> 19:18.800
Said our son was a prodigy.

19:18.900 --> 19:20.700
Did you tell them he'd been playing for only two weeks?

19:20.800 --> 19:22.600
Well. They thought I was putting them on.

19:22.700 --> 19:26.700
Talked about how his playing was worthy of a scholarship.

19:26.800 --> 19:31.100
You know. I thought this kid was going to wind 
up working on the assembly line like his old man.

19:31.200 --> 19:33.000
Now he's got a way out.

19:33.100 --> 19:34.100
Hmm.

19:34.300 --> 19:36.600
Ms. Tobey's at ntac today for a physical.

19:36.700 --> 19:39.500
We're asking the parents of the students she's 
"gifted" to come in to be interviewed.

19:39.600 --> 19:41.500
No problem. I'll call his mom.

19:41.600 --> 19:44.400
We'll do anything we need to to get 
heather back in that classroom.

19:44.500 --> 19:45.600
Great.

19:45.700 --> 19:46.500
Thanks.

19:46.600 --> 19:48.700
You should've seen them chowing down on the pizza.

19:48.800 --> 19:49.500
Just getting enough to eat.

19:49.600 --> 19:50.900
You konw it's such a struggle.

19:51.000 --> 19:53.600
And you made that struggle a little easier.

19:53.700 --> 19:54.500
I'm proud of you. Shawn.

19:54.600 --> 19:56.900
I'm thinking about going back down there.

19:57.000 --> 19:59.400
There's so much they need... jackets. Sleeping bags.

19:59.500 --> 20:02.500
Maybe a couple of first aid kits.

20:02.600 --> 20:04.700
Basic stuff to survive. You know.

20:04.800 --> 20:06.600
You give them all the supplies they need.

20:06.700 --> 20:07.900
- All right.
- But look.

20:08.000 --> 20:09.700
Whatever you do. Shawn.

20:09.800 --> 20:12.800
Don't reveal your healing ability.

20:13.000 --> 20:14.500
Why?

20:14.600 --> 20:17.000
'Cause they can't pay? No.

20:17.100 --> 20:18.700
Because if you heal one of them.

20:18.800 --> 20:21.000
You'll have to heal them all.

20:21.100 --> 20:22.600
I mean it.

20:23.100 --> 20:25.400
Not even you can do that.

20:29.800 --> 20:31.200
Yeah.

20:31.600 --> 20:33.200
I'm listening.

20:34.800 --> 20:36.500
When was this?

21:23.300 --> 21:24.100
Sweet.

21:24.200 --> 21:25.700
I'm a little rusty.

21:25.800 --> 21:28.300
One of these days. I'm going to write a concept album

21:28.400 --> 21:29.800
about my time on the street.

21:29.900 --> 21:30.600
Oh.

21:30.800 --> 21:32.900
I'm gonna win a grammy.

21:33.000 --> 21:34.600
Make the bling-bling.

21:34.700 --> 21:36.400
You know. And get a private jet.

21:36.500 --> 21:42.000
One of those big old gated houses with enough 
room for wayne. Kimmy. And shadow.

21:47.100 --> 21:49.200
Sounds like a plan.

21:50.400 --> 21:53.700
Yeah. It matches your eyes. Sweetie.

21:54.700 --> 21:56.100
Hey.

21:57.100 --> 21:59.400
First time in months I haven't seen him shivering.

21:59.500 --> 22:01.900
It's amazing what a warm coat'll do.

22:02.400 --> 22:04.700
You got yourself that guitar. Huh?

22:05.100 --> 22:07.000
No. Actually. You know what?

22:07.100 --> 22:09.000
I got you a guitar.

22:13.700 --> 22:15.200
What's the matter. Baby girl?

22:15.300 --> 22:17.900
You act like you never had a present before.

22:21.200 --> 22:23.000
It's been a while.

22:27.500 --> 22:29.700
You touch this. You die.

22:30.900 --> 22:32.700
- "Touch it. You die?"
- I guess so.

22:32.800 --> 22:34.600
What does that mean?

22:36.200 --> 22:38.100
I hate lines. Hate waiting in 'em.

22:38.200 --> 22:40.400
Trust me. There'll be no waiting tonight.

22:40.500 --> 22:41.300
I been to this club plenty of times.

22:41.400 --> 22:43.700
I know the bouncer. He'll let us walk right in.

22:43.800 --> 22:44.200
I hope you're right.

22:44.300 --> 22:46.700
I hate waiting in lines.

22:46.800 --> 22:49.800
Hey. That book you're reading is nothing but lies.

22:50.600 --> 22:51.700
Excuse me.

22:51.800 --> 22:53.200
I'm talking to you.

22:53.300 --> 22:55.400
That trash is going to rot your mind.

22:55.500 --> 22:57.400
Danny. What's going on?

22:57.500 --> 22:59.000
She ought to be careful.

22:59.100 --> 23:00.600
That book's a load of bull.

23:00.700 --> 23:01.900
- I bought it for her.
- Yeah?

23:02.000 --> 23:03.100
Big mistake.

23:03.200 --> 23:04.000
Anyone ask your opinion?

23:04.001 --> 23:05.400
Danny. Come on. Man.

23:05.500 --> 23:07.200
Just watch my back. Okay?

23:07.300 --> 23:08.200
Listen. Pal.

23:08.300 --> 23:11.000
Let me tell you a little something about cults.

23:34.000 --> 23:35.700
What's going on?

23:37.000 --> 23:38.700
You letting me go?

23:44.800 --> 23:46.700
Hello. Richard.

24:28.700 --> 24:31.000
What's with the dopey grin?

24:31.800 --> 24:34.400
Nothing. Just the way that you...

24:34.500 --> 24:37.500
you bite on your tongue when you're trying to concentrate.

24:38.200 --> 24:40.100
I've been doing that since I was a kid.

24:40.200 --> 24:42.500
How long have you been in seattle?

24:44.000 --> 24:45.700
Two years.

24:46.700 --> 24:49.100
Left my mom and her new boyfriend

24:49.200 --> 24:51.700
and came out here for the music.

24:52.000 --> 24:54.700
Somehow. My life took a weird turn.

24:55.500 --> 24:57.900
I've had a few of those myself.

24:58.100 --> 25:00.400
What. You run away from home too?

25:00.500 --> 25:02.100
Um...

25:02.200 --> 25:03.800
sort of.

25:04.000 --> 25:07.300
Except I lucked out. I found a place to run to.

25:07.400 --> 25:08.000
Otherwise...

25:08.100 --> 25:11.200
you would have wound up like the rest of us rejects?

25:11.800 --> 25:14.000
Something like that.

25:16.500 --> 25:19.600
You're one of those 4400 guys. Huh?

25:20.800 --> 25:23.100
Can you make my eyes turn green?

25:23.300 --> 25:25.600
What. You able to walk on water?

25:25.700 --> 25:28.700
I like your eyes the way that they are.

25:28.800 --> 25:30.900
And I can barely swim.

25:48.800 --> 25:49.900
Come on. Now.

25:50.000 --> 25:52.800
What the hell is this?

25:53.300 --> 25:54.800
Dewey...

25:57.000 --> 25:58.300
I see you been keeping busy.

25:58.400 --> 25:58.900
No. Baby.

25:58.901 --> 26:00.500
He's just some guy...

26:00.600 --> 26:02.400
bought us some food and blankets.

26:02.500 --> 26:03.800
Liv. Who is this guy?

26:03.900 --> 26:06.000
Shawn. You got to go.

26:06.700 --> 26:08.700
I'd listen to her.

26:09.100 --> 26:09.800
What are you doing?

26:09.900 --> 26:13.000
Well. See. She does whatever I tell her to do.

26:13.400 --> 26:15.400
Do you have a problem with that?

26:15.900 --> 26:16.800
Yeah.

26:16.900 --> 26:17.600
Yeah. I do.

26:17.700 --> 26:18.700
Shawn. Please.

26:18.800 --> 26:20.800
You've done your good deed. Just...

26:20.900 --> 26:23.400
just go home. Okay? Please.

26:23.500 --> 26:25.400
Come with me.

26:25.900 --> 26:27.600
Come with me.

26:29.200 --> 26:30.700
And then what?

26:30.800 --> 26:33.100
What. You gonna rescue me?

26:33.600 --> 26:35.800
I don't want to be saved.

26:36.100 --> 26:38.000
Get the hell out of here.

26:39.000 --> 26:40.900
Go. I mean it.

26:42.300 --> 26:43.800
Go!

26:58.100 --> 26:59.300
Hey.

26:59.400 --> 27:01.100
You're not going back to that school.

27:01.200 --> 27:02.700
Not till that woman is gone.

27:02.800 --> 27:04.600
But what about my other classes?

27:04.700 --> 27:06.000
I've got homework.

27:06.100 --> 27:07.700
Since when do you care about school?

27:07.800 --> 27:09.000
You want me to wind up like you?

27:09.001 --> 27:10.100
Hey. You watch your mouth.

27:10.300 --> 27:11.800
I don't want to fall behind.

27:11.900 --> 27:13.200
"Fall behind"?

27:13.300 --> 27:15.000
With the grades you've been bringing home?

27:15.100 --> 27:17.700
You been behind since your first report card.

27:22.700 --> 27:23.300
What. You just going to sit there.

27:23.400 --> 27:24.700
Or are you going to talk to me?

27:24.800 --> 27:27.400
'Cause I really think you owe me an explanation.

27:27.500 --> 27:29.000
You know. Those guys wanted to kill me.

27:29.100 --> 27:30.200
And I turn around.

27:30.300 --> 27:31.500
And my cousin's nowhere in sight.

27:31.600 --> 27:32.600
I don't know what happened.

27:32.601 --> 27:35.000
Yeah. I know what happened... you ran out on me.

27:35.100 --> 27:36.600
It's a good thing that security guard was there.

27:36.700 --> 27:38.000
The other time. I could blame it on the beer.

27:38.100 --> 27:38.900
You drink too much.

27:38.901 --> 27:39.700
You can black out. Right?

27:39.800 --> 27:43.300
But today. I didn't drink anything.

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
I'm blacking out.

27:47.500 --> 27:49.800
Iosing chunks of time.

27:51.300 --> 27:53.000
It's like they did something to my wiring.

27:53.100 --> 27:54.600
They?

27:55.600 --> 27:57.100
Kyle. Who are you talking about?

27:57.200 --> 27:59.000
The same ones who took shawn.

27:59.100 --> 28:01.100
Who put me in the coma.

28:03.100 --> 28:05.600
They left me messed up inside.

28:05.700 --> 28:07.300
Hey. Man. You're scaring me.

28:07.400 --> 28:09.600
How do you think I feel?

28:12.700 --> 28:13.800
Brian.

28:13.900 --> 28:14.600
Any news?

28:14.700 --> 28:16.200
Yeah. I got ahold of the weldon authorities.

28:16.300 --> 28:18.300
And richard's been released from custody.

28:18.400 --> 28:19.500
Oh. Thank god.

28:19.600 --> 28:20.900
When?

28:21.000 --> 28:23.200
About an hour ago.

28:23.300 --> 28:25.500
Why hasn't he called?

28:36.600 --> 28:38.400
You sure you don't want to call lily.

28:38.500 --> 28:40.700
Let her know you're all right?

28:40.900 --> 28:41.800
Am I?

28:41.900 --> 28:43.700
You're in no danger from me. Richard.

28:43.800 --> 28:46.000
All I want is to make you an offer.

28:46.100 --> 28:47.000
If it's not to your liking.

28:47.100 --> 28:48.300
You can walk out of here.

28:48.400 --> 28:50.100
You'll never see me again.

28:50.200 --> 28:54.300
How much did you pay those cops to call you 
instead of ntac to get my picture into their hands?

28:54.301 --> 28:56.800
It's my money. Richard.

28:57.100 --> 28:58.800
Look.

28:59.100 --> 29:02.500
You said I was free to go after I heard your offer.

29:02.800 --> 29:03.800
If you got one for me.

29:03.900 --> 29:05.200
Make it.

29:05.300 --> 29:07.200
I want you to come home.

29:07.300 --> 29:08.700
You and your family.

29:08.800 --> 29:11.400
To the 4400 center.

29:11.700 --> 29:12.600
I don't think so.

29:12.700 --> 29:14.500
You said you read my book.

29:14.600 --> 29:17.800
Which means you know why we were 
taken and what we're meant to do.

29:17.900 --> 29:19.700
The future...

29:19.800 --> 29:22.400
The future rests in our hands. Richard.

29:22.500 --> 29:24.700
You. Me. Lily... we are the chosen ones.

29:24.800 --> 29:26.700
Come on. Jordan.

29:27.400 --> 29:30.400
We both know this has nothing to do with me or lily.

29:30.500 --> 29:33.000
This is all about isabelle.

29:33.100 --> 29:34.700
Isabelle.

29:34.800 --> 29:36.000
Well. That's a lovely name.

29:36.100 --> 29:37.000
For once.

29:37.100 --> 29:39.100
Why don't you say what you really want...

29:39.200 --> 29:40.900
to take her from us. Control her.

29:41.000 --> 29:45.000
Your daughter is the future.

29:45.100 --> 29:46.700
I believed that then. I believe it now.

29:46.800 --> 29:47.800
Then what's changed?

29:47.900 --> 29:50.000
I have.

29:55.400 --> 29:56.600
I'll need more than your word.

29:56.700 --> 29:58.200
Of course.

29:58.300 --> 29:59.300
Bring me to isabelle.

29:59.400 --> 30:00.200
Let her judge me.

30:00.300 --> 30:01.500
Isabelle's not coming anywhere near you.

30:01.600 --> 30:03.000
What are you afraid of. Richard?

30:03.100 --> 30:04.600
I'm the one at risk.

30:04.700 --> 30:07.400
I'm still suffering the after-effects of our last encounter.

30:07.500 --> 30:09.700
Richard. It's simple.

30:09.800 --> 30:11.400
If I'm lying.

30:11.500 --> 30:13.300
If my motives are not pure.

30:13.400 --> 30:15.900
Isabelle will punish me accordingly.

30:16.000 --> 30:19.100
And you'll be free of me once and for all.

30:20.000 --> 30:22.200
But if I'm sincere.

30:22.400 --> 30:24.700
If isabelle accepts me.

30:25.400 --> 30:30.000
Well. Then. I can offer you and lily and the child a new life.

30:30.100 --> 30:33.600
Stop running. Richard.

30:59.200 --> 31:00.200
Forget it.

31:00.300 --> 31:02.100
It's not going to happen.

31:02.200 --> 31:05.000
There's no way I'm going to allow isabelle 
anywhere near that man.

31:05.100 --> 31:06.800
But think about it.

31:06.900 --> 31:09.100
If collier really has changed.

31:09.200 --> 31:11.600
It means we can get off the road. Stop running.

31:11.700 --> 31:13.400
That's a big if.

31:13.500 --> 31:16.000
He offered to act as a middleman between us and ntac.

31:16.100 --> 31:17.100
Says he can get them to back off.

31:17.200 --> 31:19.100
And you believe him?

31:19.200 --> 31:20.200
He's got lawyers.

31:20.300 --> 31:22.700
A whole organization behind him.

31:22.800 --> 31:23.900
We can barely even pay for gas.

31:24.000 --> 31:25.700
He's lied to us before.

31:25.800 --> 31:28.200
The man tried to destroy our relationship.

31:28.300 --> 31:30.500
Okay. Let's say he is lying.

31:30.600 --> 31:32.000
Maybe all of this is some kind of trap...

31:32.001 --> 31:33.600
to get his hands on our daughter.

31:33.700 --> 31:35.000
He wants a face-to-face with isabelle?

31:35.100 --> 31:36.700
I say we give it to him.

31:36.800 --> 31:38.200
You've seen what she's capable of.

31:38.300 --> 31:40.200
What she can do if she feels threatened.

31:40.300 --> 31:42.300
It still feels like an awful big risk.

31:42.301 --> 31:44.100
For collier.

31:49.300 --> 31:52.000
Stand back. Let her through.

32:02.400 --> 32:04.300
Get out of here!

32:06.000 --> 32:07.300
Welcome back. Heather.

32:07.400 --> 32:08.900
I'm sorry about all of this.

32:09.000 --> 32:10.700
Once the media loses interest.

32:10.701 --> 32:11.900
Things will die down.

32:12.000 --> 32:12.600
Until it does.

32:12.601 --> 32:14.900
We need to discuss how you intend to handle security.

32:15.000 --> 32:16.000
Let me get heather situated.

32:16.100 --> 32:17.600
Then I'll meet you in my office.

32:17.601 --> 32:21.100
- Come on.
- Don't get comfortable. Freak! You're not staying!

32:33.700 --> 32:37.000
I like this one with the smoke and the clouds...

32:37.500 --> 32:39.100
Greg.

32:39.400 --> 32:42.100
Does your father know you're here?

32:43.000 --> 32:45.100
It's all your fault.

32:45.200 --> 32:48.100
Everything was okay till you showed up.

32:48.600 --> 32:49.500
Greg.

32:49.600 --> 32:51.000
Please put the gun down.

32:51.100 --> 32:52.400
No.

32:52.700 --> 32:53.800
You made me do this.

32:53.900 --> 32:55.800
I have no choice.

32:55.900 --> 32:57.200
Yes. You do.

32:57.300 --> 32:58.400
But only if you put the gun away.

32:58.500 --> 33:00.900
I can't be here anymore. My dad won't let me.

33:00.901 --> 33:02.400
This is my last chance.

33:02.401 --> 33:03.500
Greg. Calm down...

33:03.600 --> 33:04.900
no!

33:05.000 --> 33:08.800
Not until you change me like you did them.

33:08.900 --> 33:10.700
You have to!

33:15.700 --> 33:17.700
There's nothing to discuss.

33:17.800 --> 33:19.400
I'll take anything.

33:19.500 --> 33:20.400
Violin.

33:20.500 --> 33:21.200
Painting.

33:21.300 --> 33:22.600
Photography. I don't care!

33:22.700 --> 33:24.600
Listen. Greg.

33:24.700 --> 33:26.500
You're problem is with me.

33:26.600 --> 33:28.500
Not your classmates.

33:28.600 --> 33:29.700
Let them go.

33:29.800 --> 33:33.900
And you and i will deal with this alone.

33:35.800 --> 33:37.400
Yeah. Sure.

33:37.800 --> 33:39.600
That works for me.

33:41.000 --> 33:42.400
Okay.

33:42.500 --> 33:44.700
I'd like you all to leave now.

33:44.800 --> 33:46.200
Quietly. Don't run.

33:46.201 --> 33:47.600
Ms. Tobey. Will you be okay?

33:47.700 --> 33:49.100
Move!

33:49.900 --> 33:50.700
Go on.

33:59.300 --> 34:00.800
For an entire week?

34:00.900 --> 34:02.100
Is that really necessary?

34:02.200 --> 34:04.100
To and from school. Strictly as a precaution.

34:04.200 --> 34:08.330
- A continued police presence will send a
clear message to anyone who feels they can...
- Okay.

34:10.000 --> 34:11.100
So now we're alone.

34:11.199 --> 34:12.400
Now. Do whatyou promised!

34:12.500 --> 34:13.500
Would you put the gun down.

34:13.600 --> 34:15.300
- No!
- Greg?

34:15.400 --> 34:16.600
Please. Put the gun down.

34:16.699 --> 34:18.000
It scares me.

34:18.100 --> 34:18.500
Well. Good.

34:18.501 --> 34:19.699
It's supposed to scare you!

34:19.701 --> 34:20.500
Greg...

34:20.600 --> 34:22.199
D.A. Says we don't have a criminal case.

34:22.300 --> 34:23.699
Fine. We'll take it to civil court.

34:23.800 --> 34:25.400
- One way or another...
- excuse us.

34:25.500 --> 34:26.600
Hey. Buddy. What's your problem?

34:26.699 --> 34:28.500
You're needed inside.

34:34.900 --> 34:36.100
I don't feel any different.

34:36.199 --> 34:37.199
Greg. I'm trying.

34:37.300 --> 34:39.000
Well. Try harder.

34:39.100 --> 34:40.800
You found it in mike. In rita...

34:40.900 --> 34:42.500
you can find it in me!

34:42.600 --> 34:43.400
I told you.

34:43.500 --> 34:44.800
I told you she was dangerous.

34:44.900 --> 34:45.600
None of you would listen.

34:45.699 --> 34:47.000
She's not the one holding the gun.

34:47.001 --> 34:48.800
Greg is a kid.

34:48.900 --> 34:50.600
He doesn't know what he's doing.

34:50.699 --> 34:52.699
She's got his mind all twisted.

34:52.800 --> 34:53.900
I got news for you.

34:54.000 --> 34:56.400
I knew everything I needed to know the first time I talked to greg.

34:56.500 --> 34:57.400
You're the one who twisted his mind.

34:57.500 --> 34:59.500
- You put that gun in his hand.
- That is not true.

34:59.600 --> 35:01.700
We both know it's true...

35:03.300 --> 35:06.700
and now you're the only one who's going to get your son out of this alive.

35:08.900 --> 35:10.300
Good.

35:10.700 --> 35:14.200
Whatever talents they have were there to begin with.

35:14.300 --> 35:16.900
But we're only talking about a handful of students.

35:17.000 --> 35:17.700
You found it in them.

35:17.800 --> 35:19.800
You can find it in me.

35:19.900 --> 35:21.600
You have to.

35:21.700 --> 35:24.000
Before I wind up like him...

35:25.000 --> 35:26.000
you know. My dad.

35:26.100 --> 35:27.400
Is that what you're afraid of?

35:27.500 --> 35:31.000
- You were worried she was going to damage your son?
- You know what my dad's like.

35:31.100 --> 35:32.400
He's nothing.

35:32.500 --> 35:33.600
He's a big. Angry nothing.

35:33.700 --> 35:36.300
And that's exactly what he wants me to be.

35:36.400 --> 35:38.600
And I can't let that happen.

35:38.700 --> 35:41.800
Now. Goddamn it. Do something!

35:49.300 --> 35:51.000
It's no good. Is it?

35:51.100 --> 35:52.800
There's nothing there.

35:54.000 --> 35:57.200
I'm sorry. Greg.

35:57.500 --> 36:01.600
Not everybody's meant to be an artist or a musician.

36:01.900 --> 36:03.900
You'll find a place.

36:04.000 --> 36:05.600
Sure I will.

36:05.700 --> 36:08.400
I have a talent for failure. Just like him.

36:09.100 --> 36:12.200
You don't have to become like your father.

36:12.300 --> 36:15.800
Somewhere along the line. He made a choice.

36:16.100 --> 36:18.500
You can make a different one.

36:18.600 --> 36:20.500
A better one.

36:23.100 --> 36:25.200
She's right. Greg.

36:25.400 --> 36:27.000
Dad?

36:27.300 --> 36:29.000
The mistakes I made...

36:29.100 --> 36:30.500
they're mine.

36:30.600 --> 36:32.500
They're not yours.

36:33.000 --> 36:35.300
Just because I failed.

36:35.800 --> 36:38.100
It doesn't mean that you have to.

36:43.100 --> 36:45.700
Please put down the gun. Greg.

36:47.800 --> 36:51.000
Don't... don't let my mistakes get you killed.

37:05.700 --> 37:07.600
Yo. Shawn!

37:09.100 --> 37:09.700
You got to do something. Man.

37:09.800 --> 37:10.700
He's knocking the crap out of her.

37:10.800 --> 37:11.700
What are you talking about?

37:11.701 --> 37:13.100
Dewey sold that guitar you got liv.

37:13.101 --> 37:15.200
Now he's all cranked up. Screaming and whatnot.

37:15.300 --> 37:16.300
She needs you.

37:16.400 --> 37:18.200
Come on. Come on

37:29.100 --> 37:30.500
A liv?

37:33.400 --> 37:34.200
I begged him.

37:34.201 --> 37:37.200
Told him he was taking too much!

37:38.800 --> 37:40.500
Dude's dying.

37:41.200 --> 37:42.500
No!

37:43.000 --> 37:44.400
No!

37:48.900 --> 37:50.000
No!

38:21.900 --> 38:23.400
Jesus...

38:25.100 --> 38:26.700
what did you do?

38:27.700 --> 38:29.400
He brought him back.

38:29.500 --> 38:31.300
What the hell happened?

38:31.400 --> 38:33.100
What happened?

38:33.200 --> 38:35.500
This guy just saved your life.

38:36.900 --> 38:38.600
Thank you.

38:39.800 --> 38:40.600
My leg...

38:40.700 --> 38:41.400
please fix it.

38:41.500 --> 38:43.400
I'm sorry, it doesn't work like that.

38:43.500 --> 38:44.600
Why not? You helped him.

38:44.700 --> 38:45.400
I...

38:45.500 --> 38:47.100
save us!

38:47.200 --> 38:48.500
No, I can'T.

38:48.600 --> 38:50.500
I can't help everyone. I'm sorry.

38:50.600 --> 38:52.500
Have mercy on us.

38:54.300 --> 38:55.500
I'm sorry.

38:55.600 --> 38:56.500
I can't help everyone.

38:56.600 --> 38:58.500
I can't help everyone.

38:58.800 --> 38:59.600
I...

38:59.700 --> 39:02.300
I can't help everyone!

39:02.800 --> 39:05.100
No! They need you.

39:43.300 --> 39:45.100
You sure about this?

39:47.200 --> 39:48.900
Yeah, I'm sure.

40:07.800 --> 40:09.200
Lily...

40:10.000 --> 40:11.700
good to see you.

40:16.400 --> 40:18.400
And this is isabelle.

40:19.100 --> 40:20.500
Hi.

40:40.800 --> 40:42.200
Yes.

40:47.000 --> 40:48.400
Yes.

40:55.700 --> 40:57.500
How's that?

40:57.900 --> 41:00.700
Well, I guess that's it.

41:01.100 --> 41:02.400
Good-bye fairview.

41:02.500 --> 41:05.000
At least, this time, it's your call.

41:05.500 --> 41:06.800
I'll find another town,

41:06.900 --> 41:08.600
another school,

41:08.700 --> 41:11.500
maybe work as a private tutor for a while.

41:11.600 --> 41:16.500
I just have to figure out a way to use 
this gift of mine without causing so much pain.

41:16.600 --> 41:19.100
Well, the worid could always use a little more beauty.

41:19.200 --> 41:21.100
I hope so.

41:21.500 --> 41:22.600
Good luck.

41:22.900 --> 41:24.500
Thanks.

41:36.700 --> 41:39.700
You know, I was thinking of getting Maia piano lessons.

41:39.800 --> 41:41.000
Oh yeah?

41:41.500 --> 41:42.400
I bet she'd like that.

41:42.500 --> 41:44.200
Or maybe even study painting,

41:44.300 --> 41:46.600
'cause she's always coloring.

41:47.500 --> 41:50.200
I guess you could call that a ripple effect.

41:50.500 --> 41:52.100
A positive one.
