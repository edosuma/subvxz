ADULT ADAM: <i> Back in the '80s,</i>
<i> the mustache was king.</i>

00:02.103 --> 00:05.804
<i> Nothing said "I'm a man"</i>
<i> like a bristly patch</i>
<i> of lip hair.</i>

00:05.806 --> 00:07.339
<i> But the manliest</i>
<i> mustache of all</i>

00:07.341 --> 00:10.576
<i> was</i> Magnum, P.I. <i> himself,</i>
<i> Tom Selleck.</i>

00:10.578 --> 00:12.378
<i> Next to my dad's, that is.</i>

00:12.380 --> 00:15.247
Hoo-hoo!
Look at Magnum go!

00:15.249 --> 00:17.116
Such power and grace.

00:17.118 --> 00:20.352
Like a mustachioed gazelle
in a Hawaiian shirt.

00:20.354 --> 00:21.787
<i> He got the idea</i>
<i> for the 'stache</i>

00:21.789 --> 00:23.455
<i> from his new best friend,</i>
<i> Bill Lewis,</i>

00:23.457 --> 00:25.991
<i> and it bonded them</i>
<i> like we'd never seen before.</i>

00:25.993 --> 00:29.661
You know, I used to think
his was a lip wig,

00:29.663 --> 00:30.963
but he swims with it.

00:30.965 --> 00:31.663
That's the real deal.

00:31.665 --> 00:33.499
You're looking pretty bushy
there, too, Mur-man.

00:33.501 --> 00:34.967
Thick and manly yourself,
Billy-boy.

00:34.969 --> 00:39.505
ADULT ADAM: <i> As much as my dad</i>
<i> loved his new mustache,</i>
<i> my mom hated it.</i>

00:39.507 --> 00:40.839
He looks like
a criminal

00:40.841 --> 00:42.975
or the tenor in a damn
barbershop quartet.

00:42.977 --> 00:46.545
Don't go around saying
your husband's in
a barbershop quartet.

00:46.547 --> 00:49.548
That is the lowest form
of musical entertainment.

00:49.550 --> 00:50.949
Just use an instrument,
damn it.

00:50.951 --> 00:53.352
You know, the only reason
he grew that mug rug

00:53.354 --> 00:54.753
is 'cause Bill
pushed him into it.

00:54.755 --> 00:56.855
I'm telling you,
the guy's a bad influence.

00:56.857 --> 01:01.093
So, it's not the fakakta
mustache you hate, it's Bill.

01:01.095 --> 01:01.894
Stop. I like
Bill all right.

01:01.896 --> 01:05.064
Well, except for the way
he dresses, drives, walks,
talks, eats, thinks, laughs,

01:05.066 --> 01:09.268
and tilts his stupid
bald head to the side
when he's confused.

01:09.270 --> 01:11.370
ADULT ADAM: <i> Yep, you could say</i>
<i> my mother wasn't</i>
<i> the biggest fan</i>

01:11.372 --> 01:15.574
<i> of my dad's bestie,</i>
<i> who was hanging around</i>
<i> more and more.</i>

01:15.576 --> 01:17.810
Ooh, <i> Charlie's Angels.</i>

01:17.812 --> 01:20.145
Who are they chasing?
Where's Bosley?

01:20.147 --> 01:21.747
Why is she on a boat?

01:21.749 --> 01:23.148
Who's she kissing?

01:23.150 --> 01:24.383
Are those pirates?

01:24.385 --> 01:25.551
These are the
opening credits, Bill.

01:25.553 --> 01:28.020
ADULT ADAM: <i> And while my mom</i>
<i> usually called the shots,</i>

01:28.022 --> 01:31.056
<i> lately, it seemed</i>
<i> that Bill was in charge.</i>

01:31.058 --> 01:31.757
A mustache comb!

01:31.759 --> 01:35.727
And all this time, I've been
using a brush with a handle
like a jackass.

01:35.729 --> 01:38.530
Give it a whirl, Mur.
Take it down to whisker town.

01:38.532 --> 01:40.632
BEVERLY: Whoa!
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:40.634 --> 01:42.000
Are you kidding me
with this?

01:42.002 --> 01:45.170
We should be talking about
shaving, not grooming.

01:45.172 --> 01:49.041
Come on, lady,
everyone knows
a man's face is his castle.

01:49.043 --> 01:49.708
His castle, you say?

01:49.710 --> 01:52.544
Oh, yeah.
And the mustache is
the moat of the mouth.

01:52.546 --> 01:54.813
Without it,
the fortress falls.

01:54.815 --> 01:55.481
Who knew? I didn't.

01:55.483 --> 01:58.450
In fact, the mustache
is named after
the Earl of mustache.

01:58.452 --> 02:00.552
What did he do?
Well, he was from
Mustache, France,

02:00.554 --> 02:04.490
and one day he was like,
"I'm gonna grow some hair
right here."

02:04.492 --> 02:06.859
You cannot argue with
history, Bevy.

02:06.861 --> 02:11.363
Honey, please, can you just
shave it off for me?

02:11.365 --> 02:12.998
ADULT ADAM: <i> Luckily, my mom</i>
<i> could always win</i>

02:13.000 --> 02:16.468
<i> using her creepy</i>
<i> 12-blink puppy dog stare...</i>

02:16.470 --> 02:17.569
This is the new me.
<i> ...until now.</i>

02:17.571 --> 02:20.305
Oh, yeah. Getting in all
the nooks and crannies.
Fantastic.

02:20.307 --> 02:21.373
Get it, Mur.
I'm getting it.

02:21.375 --> 02:22.741
You go on and get it.
Oh, I'm getting it but good.

02:22.743 --> 02:25.410
Get it, doggy. (BARKING)
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:25.412 --> 02:27.613
Is barking a mustache thing?
BILL: Oh, yeah.

02:27.615 --> 02:29.515
Go on, doggy.
I'm going!

02:29.517 --> 02:31.283
(BARKS)
Oh, yeah.

02:31.285 --> 02:32.584
<i> ¶ I'm twisted up inside</i>

02:32.586 --> 02:36.822
<i> ¶ But nonetheless</i>
<i> I feel the need to say</i>

02:38.692 --> 02:39.625
<i> ¶ I don't know the future</i>

02:39.627 --> 02:44.096
<i> ¶ But the past keeps getting</i>
<i> clearer every day ¶</i>

02:44.098 --> 02:46.465
ADULT ADAM: <i> It was October 21,</i>
<i> 1980-something,</i>

02:46.467 --> 02:49.535
<i> and my brother was doing</i>
<i> what he did best...</i>

02:49.537 --> 02:50.502
<i> Being way too cocky.</i>

02:50.504 --> 02:53.605
Uh, you sure this is
a good idea, man?

02:53.607 --> 02:54.606
Seems like the ramp points

02:54.608 --> 02:55.674
directly at the side
of the van, bro.

02:55.676 --> 02:59.545
Honestly, my concern is
I jump too high and too far.

02:59.547 --> 03:02.614
Maybe we should put a mattress
back there for safety.

03:02.616 --> 03:03.515
JTP!

03:03.517 --> 03:04.650
ALL: JTP.

03:04.652 --> 03:05.217
Oh, cool.

03:05.219 --> 03:08.153
Barry's doing
that sweet trick where he
damages his head again.

03:08.155 --> 03:09.855
Well, hello, Lainey.

03:09.857 --> 03:10.956
This is all for you, girl.

03:10.958 --> 03:13.692
Time to put myself
in serious danger.

03:13.694 --> 03:14.326
Hot, right?

03:14.328 --> 03:15.761
Barry, I told you
a million times,

03:15.763 --> 03:17.129
jumping stuff
does not impress me.

03:17.131 --> 03:18.297
ADULT ADAM: <i> For all</i>
<i> of my brother's</i>

03:18.299 --> 03:19.598
<i> ridiculous over-confidence...</i>
Wait!

03:19.600 --> 03:21.333
<i> there was one person</i>
<i> who could make him crumble</i>

03:21.335 --> 03:24.536
<i> into an insecure mess.</i>
<i> His girlfriend, Lainey Lewis.</i>

03:24.538 --> 03:27.206
I'm sorry! I'll never
jump stuff again.
See? No more bike.

03:27.208 --> 03:29.575
Okay, so now
I'm the lame-ass
ball-and-chain

03:29.577 --> 03:30.609
who says no to your passions?

03:30.611 --> 03:32.411
So, you do want me
to jump stuff?

03:32.413 --> 03:33.579
I don't care, okay?
Just do what you want.

03:33.581 --> 03:35.614
I want you
to not be mad at me.
I'm not mad at you.

03:35.616 --> 03:39.484
Well, your face and your
words are clearly mad.
Oh, my God.

03:39.486 --> 03:41.119
Tell me in words
I understand.

03:41.121 --> 03:43.088
What do I do
or feel or think?

03:43.090 --> 03:44.957
I think
you need to get a grip.

03:44.959 --> 03:47.693
Better yet, get a girl
that's not miles
out of your league.

03:47.695 --> 03:50.963
Hey, Erica!
Look what I can do!

03:54.001 --> 03:54.967
(GRUNTS)

03:54.969 --> 03:57.469
GEOFF: Is she looking?
Erica, I did it!

03:57.471 --> 03:58.971
My God.
What is Barry's deal?

03:58.973 --> 04:00.973
It's like he gets more
needy and insecure every day.

04:00.975 --> 04:02.641
I live with him.
It's constant.

04:02.643 --> 04:04.309
God, I wish
there was some way
to snap him out of it.

04:04.311 --> 04:07.746
Well, if the goal is to show
Barry what an idiot
he's being,

04:07.748 --> 04:10.682
I do have years
of wonderful experience.

04:10.684 --> 04:12.851
So you'd help
teach him a lesson?

04:12.853 --> 04:13.318
Unleash me.

04:13.320 --> 04:15.787
I don't know, you look
too excited right now.

04:15.789 --> 04:16.888
Excited to help my friend.

04:16.890 --> 04:18.123
Okay, I'm desperate.
Let's do it.

04:18.125 --> 04:19.791
Promise you won't be
too mean, though.

04:19.793 --> 04:22.060
Promise.

04:22.162 --> 04:23.662
Lainey's in love
with another man?

04:23.664 --> 04:27.666
You're dating a girl
way out of your league.
It was bound to happen.

04:27.668 --> 04:28.767
Who is it? Tell me.

04:28.769 --> 04:31.303
I'll destroy him
with my hands and feet.

04:31.305 --> 04:32.938
It's him.
Boy George?

04:32.940 --> 04:34.973
From the glam-pop band
Culture Club?

04:34.975 --> 04:36.308
What does he have
that I don't have?

04:36.310 --> 04:39.444
He's cute, he's cool,
he's stylish...

04:39.446 --> 04:40.145
Everything you're not.

04:40.147 --> 04:43.348
Then it's settled.
I'm flying to England
and challenging him to a duel.

04:43.350 --> 04:45.217
Maybe I'll even slip him
my demo tape.

04:45.219 --> 04:46.852
No, I will not get
distracted!

04:46.854 --> 04:47.953
Dude,
you're missing the point.

04:47.955 --> 04:52.424
If you can rock this look,
you can rock Lainey's heart.

04:52.559 --> 04:53.358
Yes.

04:53.360 --> 04:55.727
I don't have to destroy
Boy George.

04:55.729 --> 04:58.030
I can be Boy George.

04:58.032 --> 05:00.065
Or should I say
"Barry George"?

05:00.067 --> 05:01.266
You should say
"Boy Barry".

05:01.268 --> 05:02.567
Really?
Barry George sounds better.

05:02.569 --> 05:04.303
It really doesn't.
Boy Barry it is.

05:04.305 --> 05:06.972
Thanks, Erica.
I have no idea
how I'll ever pay you back.

05:06.974 --> 05:09.474
Money's fine.
I'll smash my piggy bank.

My God, Bill,
please don't tell me

05:31.732 --> 05:33.231
you blew all your money
on this thing.

05:33.233 --> 05:35.334
Oh, God, no.
I can't afford this car.

Just taking it out

test ride.

05:37.304 --> 05:40.138
I'm sorry, are you saying
you have no intention
of purchasing?

05:40.140 --> 05:41.239

like you...

Bup-bup! I'm still
considering it, Randy.

what do you say we Magnum over
to Geno's for cheese steaks?

05:49.149 --> 05:50.615
No, no, there's no food
allowed in the car.

05:50.617 --> 05:53.352
Uh, and we have to stay
within a two-mile radius
of the showroom.

Not now, Randy.
Let's Magnum!

Uh, Murray and I have
plans tonight.

I'm gonna iron while
he watches TV in his chair.

07:57.678 --> 08:00.278
So, this was all a lie?
You were just messing with me?

08:00.280 --> 08:02.481
How could you do this?
You're my girlfriend.

08:02.483 --> 08:05.750
I mean, do you really
want to hurt me?

08:05.752 --> 08:06.918
Oh, my God.
It's happening.

08:06.920 --> 08:09.387
Do you really want
to make me cry?

08:09.389 --> 08:10.355
He's saying it for real.

08:10.357 --> 08:12.224
I'm sorry you think
I'm so insecure.

08:12.226 --> 08:16.928
Trust me, you don't need
to worry anymore.
We're done.

08:22.169 --> 08:25.470
Thanks for
inviting me over, Bev.
This shrimp parm is delicious.

08:25.472 --> 08:27.005
Anything for
Murray's best friend.

08:27.007 --> 08:30.742
Are you saying
that I'm his best friend
or did he say that?

08:30.744 --> 08:33.912
Tell me exactly
what he said,
word for word.

08:33.914 --> 08:35.947
No, don't tell me.
Tell me.

08:35.949 --> 08:37.449
No, he said it.
Yahtzee!

08:37.451 --> 08:40.018
Oh, my God.
My heart is beating
out of my chest.

08:40.020 --> 08:41.486
Yes, it is
very exciting.

08:41.488 --> 08:43.121
And now that you two
are best bros,

08:43.123 --> 08:46.358
you're not only
important to him,
you're important to me.

08:46.360 --> 08:47.926
Thanks, Beverly.
That means a lot.

08:47.928 --> 08:51.396
Which is why I've decided,
out of the goodness
of my heart

08:51.398 --> 08:52.264
and because
I'm a decent person

08:52.266 --> 08:55.700
who cares deeply
for my husband,
to change you.

08:55.702 --> 08:56.334
Wait. Wh... What?

08:56.336 --> 08:58.603
Bill, you don't have
a woman in your life

08:58.605 --> 09:02.240
telling you
all the things you do
that are wrong and stupid.

09:02.242 --> 09:03.608
I will be that woman.

09:03.610 --> 09:05.911
Actually, I really haven't
missed that very much.

09:05.913 --> 09:07.312
Look, I'm not trying
to change who you are.

09:07.314 --> 09:11.550
I just want to fix how
you dress, drive, walk, talk,
eat, think, and laugh.

09:11.552 --> 09:13.418
That seems like
almost all of me.

09:13.420 --> 09:14.486
I don't understand
what's happening.

09:14.488 --> 09:17.689
Bup-bup. Don't move,
let's start right there.

09:18.659 --> 09:19.558
Huh?

09:19.560 --> 09:21.059
See? No need
for the head tilt.

09:21.061 --> 09:23.628
You're not a confused dog.
You're a confused man.

09:23.630 --> 09:25.330
Why the heck
are you coming down
on me so hard?

09:25.332 --> 09:28.233
Murray's mustache?
The Hawaiian shirts?

09:28.235 --> 09:29.367
The defiant attitude?

09:29.369 --> 09:31.169
That's not the husband
I created.

09:31.171 --> 09:32.237
Oh, I see
what's happening here.

09:32.239 --> 09:34.973
You want to change me
because I threaten you.

09:34.975 --> 09:36.641
You threaten me?

09:36.643 --> 09:38.243
(LAUGHS)
Oh-ho, please.

09:38.245 --> 09:40.045
You used to call
the shots with Murray,

09:40.047 --> 09:41.980
but now you're just
passing through Bill country.

09:41.982 --> 09:46.918
We'll see who calls
the shots when I get him
to shave off his mustache.

09:46.920 --> 09:48.420
Don't you dare!

09:48.422 --> 09:51.122
He looks powerful
and handsome,
like a circus strongman.

09:51.124 --> 09:54.326
Well, I think he looks
like he's got (BLEEP)
on his face.

09:54.328 --> 09:55.727
Murray is an eagle
that needs to soar,

09:55.729 --> 09:58.663
but you just want to lasso
him back to the nest.

09:58.665 --> 10:00.298
Oh, he soars!

10:00.300 --> 10:01.333
He soars big-time.

10:01.335 --> 10:02.834
And I am the wind
beneath his wings.

10:02.836 --> 10:06.538
Oh, no, I am the wind
that blows across the ocean,

10:06.540 --> 10:10.408
and Murray is but a leaf
on my mighty gust.

10:10.410 --> 10:11.009
You take that back!

10:11.011 --> 10:14.512
Never! There's a new force
of nature in Murray's life.

10:14.514 --> 10:17.282
(DEEPLY BLOWS)

10:21.188 --> 10:23.021
It's me!

10:23.190 --> 10:25.156
ADULT ADAM: <i> Bill had started</i>
<i> the mustache war,</i>

10:25.158 --> 10:27.926
<i> but my mom</i>
<i> was gonna finish it.</i>

10:27.928 --> 10:33.765
<i> It had been two days since</i>
<i> Lainey embarrassed Barry,</i>
<i> and he refused to let it go.</i>

10:33.767 --> 10:34.933
Hey.
What do you want?

10:34.935 --> 10:37.168
Got you some grind wax
for your BMX.

10:37.170 --> 10:38.336
Thought I could go watch you
jump stuff.

10:38.338 --> 10:41.606
Sorry, you don't get to live
the highs and lows

10:41.608 --> 10:44.476
that is bicycle motocross
through me anymore.

10:44.478 --> 10:45.010
I messed up.

10:45.012 --> 10:46.978
You can't just break up
with me. I love you.

10:46.980 --> 10:51.149
Well, if that's how
you treat someone you love,
count me out.

10:51.151 --> 10:54.419
Don't worry,
he'll come crawling back
when he realizes

10:54.421 --> 10:56.521
that he'll never get a girl
like you ever again.

10:56.523 --> 10:57.689
See,
that's the whole problem.

10:57.691 --> 11:01.226
For some reason,
Barry is convinced
I am out of his league.

11:01.228 --> 11:04.462
I may have mentioned it
once or twice...

11:04.464 --> 11:04.829
A day.

11:04.831 --> 11:08.733
Oh, then you're gonna help me
romance your brother
and win him back.

11:08.735 --> 11:09.300
Ew. Never.

11:09.302 --> 11:11.936
Please! There has to be
something I can do.

11:11.938 --> 11:14.239
Like Chuck Norris.
Barry loves that dude.

11:14.241 --> 11:15.874
Maybe he can apologize
for me.

11:15.876 --> 11:17.409
Chuck seems like
an accessible guy, right?

11:17.411 --> 11:19.277
Barry's written to Chuck
a few times.

11:19.279 --> 11:20.578
(CHUCKLING)
I think that's a dead end.

11:20.580 --> 11:22.580
Maybe I can jump something
to impress Barry

11:22.582 --> 11:25.517
or body slam Adam or challenge
an animal to a fight.

11:25.519 --> 11:27.952
What's the name
of that horse that Barry
has a problem with?

11:27.954 --> 11:29.487
If you really want to
fix this,

11:29.489 --> 11:30.755
just do a big, embarrassing
display that says

11:30.757 --> 11:34.726
"I love you, and I don't care
if I look like an idiot
saying it."

11:34.728 --> 11:36.895
If embarrassing myself
gets me one more kiss

11:36.897 --> 11:40.632
from his drooly,
cheeto-dusted lips, I'm in.

11:40.634 --> 11:44.736
I'm sorry, I can't...
I can't be with you
right now.

11:45.105 --> 11:45.603
I just can't.

11:45.605 --> 11:47.272
ADULT ADAM:
<i> As Lainey plotted a way</i>
<i> to show Barry her love,</i>

11:47.274 --> 11:52.644
<i> my mom's plot to win</i>
<i> the war of Murray</i>
<i> was in full swing.</i>

11:56.683 --> 11:58.450
Beverly!

11:58.919 --> 12:00.819
Good morning, handsome.

12:00.821 --> 12:02.587
I made your favorite food.

12:02.589 --> 12:04.923
And here's your newspaper
and tushie pillow.

12:04.925 --> 12:09.728
You mowed my Magnum off
while I slept.
Who does that?

12:09.730 --> 12:10.862
Funny story. Me.

12:10.864 --> 12:13.665
She lathered your face,
shaved you clean,

12:13.667 --> 12:14.733
and you didn't even wake up?

12:14.735 --> 12:16.701
When I go down,
I go down hard.

12:16.703 --> 12:18.803
Oh, I get a lot done
while he's asleep.

12:18.805 --> 12:22.974
Fingernails, nose hairs,
rough elbows, Q-tip work.

12:22.976 --> 12:24.576
Soup to nuts.

12:24.578 --> 12:27.545
Wow. It's so smooth,
like a puppy's paw.

12:27.547 --> 12:29.781
Let me get in there,
see what all the fuss
is about.

12:29.783 --> 12:33.451
I want you to drop by
Bill's store on your
lunch break

12:33.453 --> 12:34.586
and show him my handiwork.

12:34.588 --> 12:35.754
Will everybody
stop touching me?

12:35.756 --> 12:38.923
Use my name.
It's Beverly. Say it.

12:38.925 --> 12:40.125
I know your name!

12:40.127 --> 12:41.459
Is this why
you're doing all of this?

12:41.461 --> 12:43.228
Because you hate
my best friend?

12:43.230 --> 12:43.962
I don't hate him, hon.

12:43.964 --> 12:47.632
All I did was show that
ridiculous ass-for-brains

12:47.634 --> 12:48.767
whose face this is...

12:48.769 --> 12:52.237
Mine.
And you will speak of
what happened here.

12:52.239 --> 12:55.673
Enough! You, me, and Bill
are going to talk this out.

12:55.675 --> 12:56.374
You want to talk?

12:56.376 --> 13:00.645
Of course not.
But you've
forced me into it.

13:02.883 --> 13:04.449
I think he's secretly happy.
(CHUCKLES)

13:04.451 --> 13:07.085
ADULT ADAM:
<i> While my mom wanted to show</i>
<i> Bill she had won,</i>

13:07.087 --> 13:09.888
<i> Lainey was trying to</i>
<i> win back Barry.</i>

13:09.890 --> 13:11.990
Hey, big tasty.
It's me, McDLT.

13:11.992 --> 13:13.725
I keep the hot side hot
and the cool side cool.

13:13.727 --> 13:16.928
I'm not interested.
Maybe this
will change your mind.

13:16.930 --> 13:19.030
JTP, kick me a beat.

13:19.032 --> 13:20.665
(BEAT-BOXING POORLY)

13:20.667 --> 13:22.167
Let the whole school
laugh at me, I don't care.

13:22.169 --> 13:25.270
(RAPPING)
<i> ¶ I'd do anything for</i>
<i> a guy named Barry</i>

13:25.272 --> 13:27.438
<i> ¶ All the girls want him,</i>
<i> but I don't want to share-y ¶</i>

13:27.440 --> 13:30.842
ADULT ADAM:
<i> What followed was the worst,</i>
<i> most ill-conceived rap</i>

13:30.844 --> 13:32.277
<i> ever performed</i>
<i> in school history.</i>

13:32.279 --> 13:34.979
<i> Unfortunately, Lainey was hot</i>
<i> and popular, so this happened.</i>

13:34.981 --> 13:38.283
Hey, Lainey Lewis is rapping.
She's awesome.

13:38.285 --> 13:40.752
<i> ¶ Love is a love</i>
<i> I'm thinking of</i>

13:40.754 --> 13:43.021
<i> ¶ Love is a love</i>
<i> that loves my love</i>

13:43.023 --> 13:45.423
<i> ¶ Love from above</i>
<i> fits like a glove ¶</i>

13:45.425 --> 13:46.858
ADULT ADAM:
<i> Like any great performance,</i>

13:46.860 --> 13:48.092
<i> there was something</i>
<i> for everyone.</i>

13:48.094 --> 13:51.429
No, she's making fun of
Barry Goldberg's dreams
and aspirations.

13:51.431 --> 13:52.964
Hilarious.
Give it to him, Lainey!

13:52.966 --> 13:54.833
ADULT ADAM:
<i> Well, everyone except Barry,</i>

13:54.835 --> 13:56.701
<i> who was elbowed out of</i>
<i> his own apology rap,</i>

13:56.703 --> 13:57.936
<i> which quickly caught on</i>
<i> with the crowd.</i>

13:57.938 --> 14:00.505
ALL:
<i> ¶ Love is a love</i>
<i> that loves my love ¶</i>

14:00.507 --> 14:01.606
Barry, where are you going?

14:01.608 --> 14:02.807
She's showing
how much she loves you

14:02.809 --> 14:04.542
by embarrassing herself
the way that you would.

14:04.544 --> 14:07.846
She can't even embarrass
herself when she tries.

14:07.848 --> 14:11.082
All this proves
is what you've always said.

14:11.084 --> 14:11.916
She's out of my league.

14:11.918 --> 14:15.920
ADULT ADAM:
<i> While Barry gave up on Lainey,</i>
<i> my dad was fighting for Bill.</i>

14:15.922 --> 14:19.257
Okay, you two
have forced my hand,

14:19.259 --> 14:22.093
so now we're gonna
have to talk...

14:22.095 --> 14:23.761
About feelings.

14:23.763 --> 14:25.763
I'll go first.

14:25.765 --> 14:26.364
I'm feeling mad.

14:26.366 --> 14:30.168
You're mad?
How could you let her
take your 'stache, Mur? How?

14:30.170 --> 14:32.570
That's not the only thing
I took, big guy.

14:32.572 --> 14:35.373
That's not yours!
That's a friendship comb!

14:35.375 --> 14:36.174
It's a spoil of war.

14:36.176 --> 14:38.343
Stop it, both of you.
There is no war.

14:38.345 --> 14:41.379
Open your eyes, fool.
Look at her just
peacocking me.

14:41.381 --> 14:44.382
She thinks she's won,
but we're just
getting started.

14:44.384 --> 14:45.884
Are we, now?

14:45.886 --> 14:46.517
We are.

14:46.519 --> 14:47.952
Court-side seats
to the Sixers, Mur.

14:47.954 --> 14:52.357
You want to stay here
and watch <i> Charlie's Angels</i>
or go watch Charlie Barkley?

14:52.359 --> 14:53.825
Nobody calls him that.

14:53.827 --> 14:54.993
Someone does,
maybe his mama

14:54.995 --> 14:57.195
or a close cousin
who's more like a sibling.

14:57.197 --> 14:57.762
All right, enough.

14:57.764 --> 14:59.364
Bevy, you're gonna have to be
the bigger person here

14:59.366 --> 15:01.599
and apologize
so we can move past this.

15:01.601 --> 15:02.267
Me apologize? For what?

15:02.269 --> 15:06.271
That's right, Bevy.
Looks like your man's
on my side.

15:06.273 --> 15:06.871
There are no sides.

15:06.873 --> 15:09.540
I think it's time
we settle this
once and for all.

15:09.542 --> 15:13.344
It's a simple choice, really.
Her or me?

15:13.413 --> 15:14.112
What?

15:14.114 --> 15:15.747
That's right, woman.
You forgot.

15:15.749 --> 15:21.753
I negotiate big
tile contracts for a living,
and I always win.

15:23.123 --> 15:25.156
Overplayed my hand, huh?

15:25.158 --> 15:26.057
Yeah, you did.

15:26.059 --> 15:27.225
Hey, listen.
I got a counteroffer.

15:27.227 --> 15:29.294
How about Tuesday nights
and every other weekend?

15:29.296 --> 15:32.630
Yeah, the thing is,
she's my wife.

15:32.632 --> 15:34.132
It's, it's over.

15:34.134 --> 15:34.899
Nah, I get it.

15:34.901 --> 15:35.900
Makes sense now
with a little distance.

15:35.902 --> 15:40.438
Yeah, we probably should have
discussed the details
of your plan beforehand.

15:40.440 --> 15:42.307
Seems that way.

15:42.309 --> 15:43.308
(DOOR CLOSES)
It's for the best.

15:43.310 --> 15:47.512
For you.
You're in charge around here,
and I'm good with that.

15:47.514 --> 15:49.814
But I kind of liked
having a friend,

15:49.816 --> 15:53.251
and it would have been nice
if you liked him, too.

15:59.626 --> 16:00.959
ADULT ADAM:
<i> Even though my mom won</i>

16:00.961 --> 16:02.994
<i> the infamous</i>
<i> Goldberg mustache war,</i>

16:02.996 --> 16:05.129
<i> my dad was the real casualty.</i>

16:09.169 --> 16:10.935
Who's there? Bill?

16:10.937 --> 16:11.402
Better.

16:11.404 --> 16:14.472
I'm Charlie's most sensible
angel, Kate Jackson.

16:14.474 --> 16:17.008
I'm the one
who wears pants.

16:17.410 --> 16:19.377
What is this?
What's happening?

16:19.379 --> 16:20.044
Glad you asked, Bosley.

16:20.046 --> 16:22.180
I was thinking we could take
a little joy ride

16:22.182 --> 16:25.416
in this sporty automobile
we have no intention
of buying.

16:25.418 --> 16:28.953
But you said we were close.
I ran a credit check.

16:28.955 --> 16:30.321
Don't blow the sale, Randy.

16:30.323 --> 16:32.390
Honey, I know
Bill was your friend,

16:32.392 --> 16:33.591
but I'm your best friend.

16:33.593 --> 16:36.527
And any fun you had with him,
you can have with me.

16:36.529 --> 16:39.831
I'm sorry, Bevy.
It's just not the same.

16:39.833 --> 16:41.332
I'm gonna go in
and watch TV.

16:41.334 --> 16:44.068
You can come in and iron
if you want.

16:44.070 --> 16:44.902
But I bought a wig.

16:44.904 --> 16:48.806
I will no longer be a pawn
in your family drama!

16:48.808 --> 16:49.841
(ENGINE TURNS OVER)

16:49.843 --> 16:51.242
(TIRES SQUEAL)
<i> While Randy had had enough,</i>

16:51.244 --> 16:56.214
<i> Lainey was finally realizing</i>
<i> that it was over with Barry.</i>

16:56.216 --> 16:56.914
(SIGHS)

16:56.916 --> 16:58.149
I can't believe
it's really over.

16:58.151 --> 17:01.185
You really love
that big dummy,
don't you?

17:01.187 --> 17:03.054
I really do.

17:03.656 --> 17:06.124
ADULT ADAM:
<i> And in that moment,</i>
<i> my sister decided to do</i>

17:06.126 --> 17:08.993
<i> the last thing</i>
<i> she ever wanted to.</i>

17:08.995 --> 17:11.629
<i> Win back my brother's heart.</i>

17:11.631 --> 17:14.599
Put down the Cheetos.
Lainey needs you.

17:14.601 --> 17:16.601
Trust me, she doesn't.

17:16.603 --> 17:18.236
She does.

17:18.238 --> 17:21.139
Look,
a lot of this is my fault.

17:21.141 --> 17:24.242
I've told you every day
that you're not good enough
for her.

17:24.244 --> 17:26.377
But you know what?

17:26.379 --> 17:27.445
I was wrong.

17:27.447 --> 17:28.546
She's lucky to have you.

17:28.548 --> 17:31.215
But she embarrassed me
in front of the whole school.

17:31.217 --> 17:34.919
And you embarrass her
every day by being you.

17:35.522 --> 17:36.287
You're right.

17:36.289 --> 17:39.424
I'm the worst,
and she still loves me.

17:39.959 --> 17:41.759
She loves me!

17:44.664 --> 17:46.931
That was an amazing thing
you just did, honey.

17:46.933 --> 17:49.834
I guess sometimes two people
just need each other

17:49.836 --> 17:51.803
no matter how weird it seems
to everyone else.

17:51.805 --> 17:54.806
ADULT ADAM:
<i> That night, Erica didn't just</i>
<i> open up Barry's eyes.</i>

17:54.808 --> 17:58.676
<i> She made my mom realize</i>
<i> how blind she'd been.</i>

18:02.849 --> 18:05.216
Mom, what are you doing?

18:05.218 --> 18:07.418
Not now, Poopie.

18:12.225 --> 18:13.057
I'll catch up with you.

18:13.059 --> 18:15.960
BEVERLY: Wear a raincoat
next time.

18:16.296 --> 18:18.162
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

18:18.364 --> 18:19.964
Bill, we need to talk.

18:19.966 --> 18:21.499
Who is it?

18:21.501 --> 18:23.167
No one.

18:23.303 --> 18:24.268
I deserve that.

18:24.270 --> 18:27.305
Bill, I am so sorry
for everything.

18:27.307 --> 18:28.306
I felt threatened, okay?

18:28.308 --> 18:32.477
I started to think maybe
you could give Murray
things that I couldn't,

18:32.479 --> 18:37.415
but I realize that might
actually be a good thing.

18:38.184 --> 18:40.418
You know
what's a good thing?

18:40.753 --> 18:43.054
This right here.

18:45.225 --> 18:48.025
And, Lainey,
Barry loves you so much.

18:48.027 --> 18:50.094
I think he was so afraid
of losing you,

18:50.096 --> 18:52.363
he ended up
pushing you away.

18:52.365 --> 18:53.931
Lainey! Lainey!

18:53.933 --> 18:55.299
We have to talk.

18:55.301 --> 18:56.767
It's okay. We're okay.

18:56.769 --> 18:58.503
We are?
Yeah.

18:58.505 --> 19:00.171
But I didn't even
get to say what I...

19:00.173 --> 19:03.374
Shh.
Mama took care of it.

19:04.110 --> 19:04.775
Are you kidding me?

19:04.777 --> 19:06.878
I had a beautiful speech
planned out.

19:06.880 --> 19:09.280
(GASPS) Cramping.
My leg's cramping.
Oh, oh, sit.

19:09.282 --> 19:10.381
You know,
now that we're square,

19:10.383 --> 19:13.117
maybe I'll go upstairs
and shave the old 'stache.

19:13.119 --> 19:16.521
There's only one thing
you need to do right now...

19:16.523 --> 19:18.489
Go to him.

19:20.393 --> 19:22.827
I'm coming, Mur!

19:24.264 --> 19:25.830
Why are we running, too?

19:25.832 --> 19:28.833
I left a lasagna
in the oven.

19:28.835 --> 19:30.835
Lasagna!

19:31.371 --> 19:36.073
ADULT ADAM: <i> In life, there are</i>
<i> certain relationships</i>
<i> that define who you are,</i>

19:36.075 --> 19:37.108
<i> your first teen crush,</i>

19:37.110 --> 19:39.544
<i> your best friend,</i>
<i> your family...</i>

19:39.546 --> 19:43.381
For $5,000,
it's the title of a play...

19:43.383 --> 19:45.783
<i> Death of a Salesmat.</i>

19:45.785 --> 19:46.751
Really?

19:46.753 --> 19:47.451
What's a salesmat?

19:47.453 --> 19:51.689
How would I know?
I'm not a salesmat salesman.

19:51.691 --> 19:54.192
Aww, so close, baby.

19:54.194 --> 19:54.892
You two are the worst.

19:54.894 --> 19:56.894
ADULT ADAM:
<i> These are the relationships</i>
<i> that matter the most.</i>

19:56.896 --> 20:00.565
<i> But they're also the hardest,</i>
<i> 'cause when you</i>
<i> truly love someone,</i>

20:00.567 --> 20:02.600
<i> you sometimes hold on</i>
<i> too tight,</i>

20:02.602 --> 20:04.068
<i> afraid that you'll lose them.</i>

20:04.070 --> 20:06.571
Here you go, boys.
Bagel bites.

20:06.573 --> 20:08.506
Actually, I think
I'm gonna take off.

20:08.508 --> 20:10.474
Got somewhere to be.

20:12.145 --> 20:13.444
Later, Bill.
Yep.

20:13.446 --> 20:14.745
ADULT ADAM:
<i> But the truth is,</i>

20:14.747 --> 20:18.416
<i> when you give the people</i>
<i> you love most</i>
<i> just a little space,</i>

20:18.418 --> 20:21.219
<i> you'll find the place</i>
<i> they really want to be</i>

20:21.221 --> 20:23.287
<i> is right at your side.</i>

20:29.462 --> 20:30.828
(BELL DINGS)

20:30.830 --> 20:32.763
<i> Oh, Adam, please.</i>

20:35.602 --> 20:40.304
<i> You know, you have to start</i>
<i> getting dressed, okay?</i>

20:40.306 --> 20:42.340
<i> Please turn that off.</i>

20:45.645 --> 20:46.344
Out of the way, nerd.

20:46.346 --> 20:48.379
Hey, I was just
looking through the mail.

20:48.381 --> 20:51.048
Actually, there's something
here for you.

20:51.050 --> 20:52.216
"Master Barry Goldberg?"

20:52.218 --> 20:54.952
From C. Norris?
Hollywood, California?

20:54.954 --> 20:58.322
Dude, Chuck Norris
wrote me back!

21:02.028 --> 21:05.997
(NORRIS VOICE)
<i> "Dear Barry, sorry it took me</i>
<i> so long to write back,</i>

21:05.999 --> 21:08.933

<i> "to what I'm about</i>

21:11.938 --> 21:13.070
What's he saying?
Shut up!

21:25.618 --> 21:28.486
So, what's it say,
douche-nozzle?

21:28.488 --> 21:31.889
It says
I should kick your ass.
