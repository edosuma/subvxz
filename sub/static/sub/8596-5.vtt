WEBVTT

00:01.753 --> 00:03.630
We were born in space.

00:03.838 --> 00:05.966
They told us the ground
was uninhabited,

00:06.174 --> 00:08.259
but they were wrong,
and we've been fighting

00:08.468 --> 00:11.638
for our lives since
the moment we landed.

00:11.846 --> 00:14.349
Some of us have been
broken by it,

00:14.557 --> 00:16.434
but most of us are still here,

00:16.643 --> 00:18.895
searching for other survivors
from the ark,

00:19.104 --> 00:21.189
trying to build something
real and lasting

00:21.398 --> 00:23.400
out of the wilderness--a home.

00:23.608 --> 00:25.193
Our leaders believe
that to survive,

00:25.402 --> 00:27.696
we need to make peace
with the grounders,

00:27.904 --> 00:30.865
but peace
is a foreign concept here.

00:31.074 --> 00:32.826
I'm not going in.

00:33.034 --> 00:33.785
Clarke--

00:33.994 --> 00:34.995
it's just
gonna remind me

00:35.203 --> 00:36.454
of what I did
to get them here.

00:36.663 --> 00:38.081
May we meet again.

00:38.289 --> 00:41.376
The grounders out there
will attack this camp.

00:41.584 --> 00:43.461
If we wait, we die.

00:43.670 --> 00:46.923
10 men with automatic rifles
is all it would take.

00:47.132 --> 00:49.384
You're asking me
to get you the guns.

00:49.592 --> 00:50.885
Get out of the way,
grounder.

00:51.094 --> 00:52.262
What the hell do
you think you're doing?

00:52.470 --> 00:53.763
What you didn't
have the guts to.

00:53.972 --> 00:56.266
- Pike for chancellor!
- Pike! Pike! Pike!

00:56.474 --> 00:57.851
Congratulations,
Mr. chancellor.

00:58.059 --> 01:00.562
Let's finish
what we started.

01:11.364 --> 01:14.242
Thinking about home?

01:14.451 --> 01:16.703
Thinking about whether
Arkadia is home.

01:18.663 --> 01:22.083
When I left, it had
a different name.

01:22.292 --> 01:23.376
I was different.

01:23.585 --> 01:25.837
You left a hero
to your people,

01:26.046 --> 01:27.505
and you return one.

01:27.714 --> 01:29.424
The Mountain slayer
returns with the body

01:29.632 --> 01:31.593
of the ice queen.

01:31.760 --> 01:33.011
You bring them
justice.

01:33.219 --> 01:35.722
You bring them
justice.

01:35.930 --> 01:37.682
We bring them peace.

01:40.935 --> 01:43.271
Hey, here they are.

01:43.438 --> 01:45.940
My God,
look at them.

01:46.149 --> 01:47.609
- What happened to them?
- Look at that.

01:47.817 --> 01:49.778
- They're in bad shape.
- Pretty hurt.

01:51.696 --> 01:54.866
- What happened?
- Bellamy, you OK?

01:55.075 --> 01:57.118
- I'm fine.
- What happened out there?

02:00.622 --> 02:03.792
- What's going on?
- The chancellor said...

02:04.000 --> 02:05.502
Lock it up.

02:05.710 --> 02:07.378
All right. Seal it up.

02:13.843 --> 02:16.179
Everybody listen up.

02:16.387 --> 02:18.348
Hey, hey, hey.

02:18.556 --> 02:22.769
24 hours ago, you elected me
your chancellor.

02:22.977 --> 02:27.148
Every action I've taken since
and every action I will take

02:27.357 --> 02:32.779
will be to achieve
one sacred goal--

02:32.987 --> 02:36.908
the creation of
a self-sustaining, prosperous,

02:37.117 --> 02:39.494
and safe Arkadia.

02:39.702 --> 02:41.121
- All right!
- Yeah.

02:41.329 --> 02:43.581
This morning
on a muddy field,

02:43.790 --> 02:47.669
our people paid tribute to those
who have been taken from us

02:47.877 --> 02:51.214
by sending a message
to the grounders.

02:51.422 --> 02:54.467
This land is ours now.

02:56.845 --> 02:59.848
Resist, and you
will be met by force.

03:00.056 --> 03:03.476
Fight, and you will be
greeted by death.

03:05.603 --> 03:08.606
Today is a new beginning.
Mark it down.

03:08.815 --> 03:12.026
Remember it just like
the grounders will remember it.

03:16.614 --> 03:18.658
Chancellor pike,
you tell them, pike.

03:25.206 --> 03:27.959
No wounded.

03:28.168 --> 03:31.921
10 against 300,
and there's no wounded.

03:33.423 --> 03:36.301
How's that possible?

03:39.470 --> 03:40.680
Heda!

04:43.243 --> 04:45.078
All bullet wounds.

04:45.286 --> 04:46.788
Heda...

04:53.920 --> 04:56.965
- Indra.
- Heda. Nngh!

04:59.217 --> 05:00.593
OK.

05:00.802 --> 05:02.720
Aah! Nngh!

05:02.929 --> 05:04.180
I need bandages.

05:04.389 --> 05:06.140
Stay away.
You're one of them.

05:06.349 --> 05:07.183
Indra...

05:09.727 --> 05:10.895
Nngh!

05:11.104 --> 05:12.355
Indra, what
happened here?

05:12.563 --> 05:15.441
They attacked
while we slept.

05:15.650 --> 05:18.987
Our watch was to the north
looking for Azgeda.

05:19.195 --> 05:21.030
They killed
our archers first.

05:21.239 --> 05:24.158
Our infantry
couldn't get close.

05:24.367 --> 05:27.078
Then they executed
the wounded.

05:29.622 --> 05:31.749
The summit was
two days ago.

05:31.958 --> 05:34.085
How could Kane
do this?

05:34.294 --> 05:36.671
It wasn't Kane.

05:36.879 --> 05:38.840
It was pike.

05:41.259 --> 05:43.678
How did you escape?

05:43.886 --> 05:46.014
Bellamy.

05:46.222 --> 05:48.182
Bellamy was
with them?

05:48.391 --> 05:50.393
He wanted
to spare the wounded,

05:50.601 --> 05:52.729
but they wouldn't listen.

05:52.937 --> 05:55.898
He convinced pike
to let me live

05:56.107 --> 05:58.067
so I could deliver
a message.

06:00.611 --> 06:01.779
What message?

06:01.988 --> 06:05.742
Skaikru rejects
the coalition.

06:05.950 --> 06:08.411
This is their land now.

06:08.619 --> 06:12.165
We can leave,
or we can die.

06:16.461 --> 06:18.379
Send riders.

06:20.882 --> 06:24.385
I call upon the armies
of the twelve clans.

06:24.594 --> 06:27.680
In a day's time,
we lay waste to Arkadia

06:27.889 --> 06:29.349
and everyone
within its walls.

06:29.557 --> 06:30.808
Sha, Heda.
Mount up.

06:31.017 --> 06:33.644
Wait.

06:33.853 --> 06:36.939
Give me time
to fix this.

06:42.111 --> 06:44.322
What are you doing?

06:44.530 --> 06:46.741
I can't let you
leave, Clarke.

06:46.949 --> 06:48.910
So I'm a prisoner now,
just like that?

06:49.118 --> 06:50.787
Yes.

06:50.995 --> 06:53.915
Lexa, let me go
to Arkadia.

06:54.123 --> 06:55.208
No.

06:55.416 --> 06:56.918
At least let me
talk to Kane.

06:57.085 --> 06:58.836
We can
bring him here.

06:59.045 --> 07:01.756
Indra, at the summit,
Kane told me

07:01.964 --> 07:05.051
he gave you a radio,
a way to signal him.

07:05.259 --> 07:08.930
Do it, please.

07:17.605 --> 07:18.773
Is it true you
tried to leave camp

07:18.981 --> 07:20.274
to see Indra
yesterday?

07:20.441 --> 07:22.360
Look. Don't you have
more important things

07:22.568 --> 07:24.612
to worry about than me
sneaking out of camp?

07:24.821 --> 07:26.572
As it turns out,

07:26.781 --> 07:29.367
that's why
you're here.

07:30.660 --> 07:33.621
Indra signaled.
She wants to meet.

07:33.788 --> 07:36.290
I'd go myself,
but pike's watching

07:36.499 --> 07:38.793
everything I do now.

07:42.046 --> 07:44.882
You want me to go
see Indra?

07:45.091 --> 07:47.885
I need you to.

07:48.094 --> 07:49.929
I'm in, but how
do I get out?

07:50.138 --> 07:52.473
The gate
is armed with--

07:56.644 --> 07:58.354
crawl space door
in 20 feet

07:58.563 --> 07:59.897
drops you outside
the camp wall.

08:00.106 --> 08:02.525
Get out there. You find out
what the hell happened.

08:02.733 --> 08:05.361
Then you report back here.
Can you do that?

08:08.489 --> 08:11.284
I was born for this.

08:11.492 --> 08:13.703
Marcus Kane, report
to the chancellor's office.

08:13.911 --> 08:15.329
Marcus Kane to
the chancellor's office.

08:17.623 --> 08:20.751
Our goal is secure access
to water and arable land

08:20.960 --> 08:24.172
with defensible terrain on
as many sides of us as possible.

08:24.380 --> 08:26.591
A 15-kilometer perimeter
around Arkadia

08:26.799 --> 08:28.176
should be sufficient.

08:28.384 --> 08:30.094
15 kilometers?

08:30.303 --> 08:31.637
Sir, there's
a grounder village.

08:31.846 --> 08:33.347
Which will, no doubt,
be the staging area

08:33.556 --> 08:35.266
for a retaliatory
attack.

08:35.475 --> 08:37.977
Clearing it will be our
first order of business.

08:38.186 --> 08:39.854
What's the location
of the village?

08:40.062 --> 08:41.481
Clear the village?

08:44.609 --> 08:46.194
Give us
the room.

08:46.402 --> 08:47.945
Yes, sir.

08:48.154 --> 08:50.781
Kane and Lincoln
are waiting outside.

09:02.084 --> 09:03.836
Thought you might
like this back.

09:12.970 --> 09:15.640
Do you have something
to say to me?

09:18.142 --> 09:20.478
We went too far.

09:20.686 --> 09:22.563
I know
it seems harsh,

09:22.772 --> 09:24.315
but we don't
leave survivors.

09:24.524 --> 09:26.025
We don't have
the medical supplies

09:26.234 --> 09:28.611
to treat their people,
and we can't risk them

09:28.819 --> 09:32.365
coming back to kill us.

09:38.246 --> 09:40.164
You know, we've all
learned pretty quickly

09:40.373 --> 09:42.875
that war causes us
to do things

09:43.084 --> 09:45.878
that we'll
spend the rest

09:46.087 --> 09:49.298
of our lives
trying to forget.

09:49.507 --> 09:52.510
The only advice
I can give you

09:52.718 --> 09:56.180
is to think about the
lives we saved today,

09:56.389 --> 09:59.892
not the ones
that were lost.

10:01.394 --> 10:03.521
Can you do that?

10:04.939 --> 10:06.983
Yes, sir.

10:32.341 --> 10:34.051
He's ready for you.

10:34.260 --> 10:36.053
What the hell
happened out there?

10:38.931 --> 10:41.934
We did what
we had to do.

10:42.143 --> 10:44.061
Wake up.

10:44.270 --> 10:47.732
You attacked an army
that was there to help us.

10:47.940 --> 10:50.526
You murdered
innocent people.

10:50.735 --> 10:53.613
Is that who
you are now?

10:53.821 --> 10:55.197
You thought you couldn't
live with yourself

10:55.406 --> 10:56.616
after mount weather.

10:56.824 --> 10:58.826
Well, you just
started a war

10:58.993 --> 11:00.328
that'll kill us all.

11:00.536 --> 11:02.705
You need to wake up,
and don't tell me

11:02.913 --> 11:05.416
the difference between
Azgeda and Trikru.

11:05.625 --> 11:08.002
Trikru killed
37 of my friends

11:08.210 --> 11:10.254
before you even
touched the ground.

11:10.463 --> 11:13.382
We didn't start
anything.

11:13.591 --> 11:14.925
They did.

11:15.134 --> 11:17.178
They?

11:17.345 --> 11:19.013
You know
what I meant.

11:21.974 --> 11:23.601
I used to.

11:37.531 --> 11:39.575
Danae's still
getting worse.

11:41.661 --> 11:43.746
Antibiotics
every two hours.

11:45.247 --> 11:47.166
Keep me updated.

11:48.668 --> 11:50.419
- What the hell, Abby?
- Raven, calm down.

11:50.628 --> 11:52.296
- I know that you're upset.
- Upset?

11:52.505 --> 11:54.590
I just showed up for work
and found out you fired me.

11:54.799 --> 11:56.217
I don't fire people.

11:56.425 --> 11:58.344
Not clearing me medically
is the same damn thing.

11:58.552 --> 11:59.845
Come on.
Let's go sit down.

12:00.054 --> 12:01.722
No. I don't need to sit down.
My leg is fine.

12:01.931 --> 12:04.058
No, it's not,

12:04.266 --> 12:06.268
and riding a patrol
and working that wall

12:06.477 --> 12:09.438
are making your
conditions worse.

12:09.647 --> 12:12.316
So what,

12:12.525 --> 12:14.944
do nothing?

12:15.152 --> 12:16.946
That's gonna make
my leg heal?

12:17.154 --> 12:19.824
No. Your leg
is never gonna heal.

12:20.032 --> 12:21.450
Our goal is
pain reduction--

12:21.659 --> 12:24.412
that's it--and if you
keep pushing this hard,

12:24.620 --> 12:27.707
even that's
not gonna happen.

12:30.668 --> 12:32.795
You can still
be useful.

12:47.852 --> 12:49.895
They've been busy.

12:52.732 --> 12:55.025
Welcome home,
Thelonious.

12:57.027 --> 12:58.738
Let's begin.

12:58.946 --> 13:01.866
Otan, stay close.

13:08.622 --> 13:09.999
Open up!

13:10.207 --> 13:12.126
I didn't see
that coming.

13:13.919 --> 13:16.881
I want people
on that gate.

13:18.841 --> 13:20.676
Chancellor Jaha?

13:20.885 --> 13:23.137
Sir, it's good
to see you.

13:23.345 --> 13:27.016
Shawn Gillmer?
Farm station made it?

13:27.224 --> 13:28.517
Not enough
of us, sir.

13:28.726 --> 13:29.518
Hands where
I can see them.

13:29.727 --> 13:30.936
It's OK.
He's with me.

13:31.145 --> 13:32.438
Sorry, sir.

13:32.646 --> 13:34.815
No grounders
through the gates,

13:35.024 --> 13:36.275
chancellor's orders.

13:36.484 --> 13:40.154
I said, he's with me.

13:40.362 --> 13:42.031
Tell him to hand
over the pack

13:42.239 --> 13:43.866
right now.

13:44.074 --> 13:45.451
Hey, stop it. No!

13:45.659 --> 13:46.619
- Otan!
- Agh!

13:46.827 --> 13:48.245
Come on.
We're taking him.

13:48.454 --> 13:49.580
Otan!

13:51.415 --> 13:53.626
Hold your fire.
Medic! We need a medic!

13:55.377 --> 13:57.421
This belongs to me.

13:59.548 --> 14:02.301
He was going
for my gun.

14:03.844 --> 14:05.930
You'll be
all right, Otan.

14:06.138 --> 14:08.641
Go to
the city of light.

14:08.849 --> 14:11.560
Alie will be waiting for
you on the other side.

14:13.062 --> 14:14.855
Right over here.
Hurry.

14:17.650 --> 14:19.610
Thelonious?

14:32.122 --> 14:36.085
He's gone.
I'm sorry.

14:36.293 --> 14:38.712
Don't be.

14:38.921 --> 14:40.840
Death is not the end.

14:43.259 --> 14:46.637
It's good
to see you, Abby.

15:10.578 --> 15:12.162
You there.

15:53.704 --> 15:55.956
Took you long enough.

16:03.714 --> 16:05.591
Uh!

16:09.136 --> 16:10.846
What did he say?

16:11.055 --> 16:14.183
He said you're cute
for a thief.

16:14.391 --> 16:16.644
Yeah. Well, too bad
he's not really my type.

16:22.232 --> 16:25.110
Let's get out of here.

16:26.612 --> 16:28.656
Oh, don't worry
about John Murphy.

16:28.864 --> 16:30.074
That boy's a fighter.

16:30.282 --> 16:31.283
And the others?

16:31.492 --> 16:33.869
You left with 12 people
Thelonious.

16:35.704 --> 16:36.997
Kane.

16:38.958 --> 16:42.044
Ah, welcome home,
my friend.

16:42.252 --> 16:43.921
Where's
your uniform?

16:44.129 --> 16:46.590
Pike just relieved me
of my command,

16:46.799 --> 16:48.884
stripped Lincoln
of his commission.

16:49.093 --> 16:51.428
Heh. You always did
have good timing.

16:51.637 --> 16:54.056
Abby
caught me up.

16:54.264 --> 16:56.600
I'm sorry about
the election, Marcus.

16:56.809 --> 16:58.060
Forget the election.

16:58.268 --> 17:00.521
The war you predicted
the day you left

17:00.729 --> 17:02.606
is about to happen.

17:02.815 --> 17:05.025
Ask him
where he's been.

17:05.234 --> 17:07.820
I found
the city of light.

17:08.028 --> 17:10.322
Well, that's great...

17:12.449 --> 17:14.118
Isn't it?

17:14.326 --> 17:16.954
Ask his friend
Otan.

17:17.162 --> 17:20.332
Apparently,
he's there right now.

17:20.541 --> 17:22.668
I don't blame you
for doubting, Abby.

17:22.876 --> 17:25.129
I know
how it sounds,

17:25.337 --> 17:27.798
but it is real, and
it is incredible.

17:28.007 --> 17:29.800
Everything that you
worry about now--

17:30.009 --> 17:31.719
war, power--

17:31.927 --> 17:34.179
none of it matters
in the city of light.

17:36.306 --> 17:38.600
I heard
you were here, sir.

17:38.809 --> 17:40.769
And I heard you
made it, Hannah.

17:40.978 --> 17:43.022
I was so glad.

17:43.230 --> 17:45.315
Chancellor pike would
like to speak with you.

17:47.860 --> 17:49.403
We'll finish
this later.

18:00.372 --> 18:02.750
Right this way, sir.
The chancellor is waiting.

18:09.840 --> 18:11.550
You look good
for a man who's been

18:11.759 --> 18:13.469
in the wilderness
for 4 months.

18:13.677 --> 18:15.637
So do you.

18:15.846 --> 18:18.307
I heard you had it
pretty rough.

18:18.515 --> 18:20.851
We gave worse
than we got.

18:21.060 --> 18:22.436
I heard that, too.

18:22.644 --> 18:25.606
- You don't approve?
- I don't judge.

18:25.814 --> 18:27.107
Since when?

18:27.316 --> 18:29.777
I'm not the same man that
I was on the ark, Charles.

18:29.985 --> 18:32.112
None of us is.

18:32.321 --> 18:34.656
I was a teacher.

18:34.865 --> 18:37.826
Now I'm chancellor.

18:38.035 --> 18:40.746
I am wondering,
though,

18:40.954 --> 18:42.247
what do you know?

18:42.456 --> 18:43.874
He's threatened
by you.

18:44.083 --> 18:46.502
I'm just a man who wants
to save his people,

18:46.710 --> 18:47.878
no threat to you.

18:48.087 --> 18:49.713
Save us?

18:49.922 --> 18:51.757
Forgive me for being
blunt, Thelonious,

18:51.965 --> 18:54.760
but I need to ask
why you've returned.

18:54.968 --> 18:58.138
I just told you--

19:00.224 --> 19:02.893
to save my people.

19:03.102 --> 19:05.062
Do you want him to think
you're a fool?

19:05.270 --> 19:08.774
- You actually believe that?
- Yes. I do.

19:08.982 --> 19:11.110
OK. I'm game.

19:11.318 --> 19:12.945
How, exactly, are
you gonna do that?

19:13.153 --> 19:15.239
By freeing the minds
from the bonds

19:15.447 --> 19:17.950
of physical
and spiritual pain.

19:18.158 --> 19:19.660
I am here

19:19.868 --> 19:21.829
to show the people
of Arkadia the way.

19:23.956 --> 19:26.041
You've lost him.

19:26.250 --> 19:29.294
Have some faith.

19:31.505 --> 19:33.841
Tell you what.

19:35.884 --> 19:38.303
As long as you
stay out of my way,

19:38.512 --> 19:40.764
you can save whoever
wants saving.

19:40.973 --> 19:43.684
Lord knows there's
enough pain here

19:43.892 --> 19:46.228
to go around.

19:51.150 --> 19:53.694
Thank you,
chancellor.

20:10.752 --> 20:12.296
Oh...

20:20.929 --> 20:23.473
The bleeding's stopped.

20:23.682 --> 20:24.850
We need to get you
something for the pain.

20:25.058 --> 20:26.810
Uh...

20:27.019 --> 20:29.188
Octavia?

20:30.397 --> 20:32.357
Where's Kane?

20:32.566 --> 20:35.068
He sent me.

20:35.277 --> 20:38.197
Indra.
Thank God.

20:39.448 --> 20:42.784
How did
this happen?

20:42.993 --> 20:46.705
Kane lost the election
to pike.

20:46.914 --> 20:50.209
Everything's different.

20:52.878 --> 20:55.464
Your people
voted for this?

20:55.672 --> 20:58.592
No. No. I don't
believe that.

20:58.800 --> 21:02.346
What do you know, Clarke?
You haven't been here.

21:02.554 --> 21:04.223
Listen to me.

21:04.431 --> 21:07.226
The grounder army is gonna
be here in less than a day.

21:07.434 --> 21:08.852
I need to see
Bellamy.

21:09.061 --> 21:11.396
Bellamy was a part of this.
He's with pike.

21:11.605 --> 21:13.190
What makes you think
he'll help us?

21:13.398 --> 21:15.442
He saved
Indra's life.

21:18.737 --> 21:21.114
If what Octavia's
saying is true,

21:21.281 --> 21:22.616
then pike trusts him.

21:22.824 --> 21:24.451
If I can get to him,
he can get to pike.

21:24.618 --> 21:26.828
You can't just walk
through the gates, Clarke.

21:27.037 --> 21:28.997
You've been living
with their enemy.

21:29.206 --> 21:31.541
If it were me, I'd
kill you on the spot.

21:33.418 --> 21:35.504
I can get her in.

21:51.103 --> 21:53.063
So where you want
to head next--

21:53.272 --> 21:55.023
the north, South?

21:55.232 --> 21:57.401
We've been on
a heck of a roll.

22:02.614 --> 22:05.701
I want to go after
my brother.

22:05.909 --> 22:07.953
We've talked
about this.

22:08.161 --> 22:10.831
Otan's with Jaha
at camp.

22:11.039 --> 22:12.165
Why would you want
to go there?

22:12.374 --> 22:14.001
He's my brother.

22:14.209 --> 22:16.211
If there's a chance,

22:16.420 --> 22:18.463
I have to try
and get him back.

22:18.672 --> 22:20.424
Going after Otan's
not a good move.

22:20.632 --> 22:22.634
- John--
- it's not a survivor's move.

22:22.843 --> 22:26.555
Then wait for me.
I'll come back.

22:26.763 --> 22:28.432
In this world,
when people leave,

22:28.640 --> 22:30.100
they don't come back.

22:30.309 --> 22:31.518
- I did.
- Not for me.

22:31.727 --> 22:32.894
I just so happened
to be there.

22:33.103 --> 22:35.731
John, come with me.

22:40.360 --> 22:42.571
I'm not that stupid.

22:45.657 --> 22:48.243
Reveille. On your feet.
Line up now. Go.

22:48.452 --> 22:51.330
What are you doing?
These are sick people.

22:51.538 --> 22:53.749
You can't just throw
them out into the cold.

22:53.957 --> 22:56.335
We're not.
They're being interned.

22:56.543 --> 22:57.794
What?

22:58.003 --> 23:00.589
Out of my way.

23:00.797 --> 23:03.091
- Stand up.
- Come on.

23:03.300 --> 23:05.886
Lincoln, you don't
want to be here right now.

23:11.725 --> 23:13.226
Oh.

23:14.394 --> 23:17.064
We asked them
to come here.

23:17.272 --> 23:19.566
We can't spare
the supplies.

23:19.733 --> 23:22.027
- Danae.
- Lincoln, no.

23:23.487 --> 23:24.654
Uh...

23:24.863 --> 23:27.199
She is too sick
to move.

23:27.407 --> 23:28.784
Uh...

23:28.992 --> 23:31.578
Looks like she's moving
just fine to me.

23:31.787 --> 23:34.539
Gillmer, back off.

23:34.748 --> 23:36.291
Jackson, why did
you bring him here?

23:36.500 --> 23:37.584
Uhh!

23:39.252 --> 23:41.004
Uh! Uh!

23:41.213 --> 23:43.131
Rrgh! Rrgh!

23:43.340 --> 23:45.300
- Lincoln--
- uh!

23:45.509 --> 23:49.137
Lincoln.
Lincoln!

23:58.438 --> 24:02.651
He goes with them.
Take him.

24:07.239 --> 24:09.282
Move.

24:09.491 --> 24:11.660
Sorry we had to do
this the hard way.

24:16.123 --> 24:17.666
We all have pain.

24:17.874 --> 24:21.586
Some of it is physical
from injuries or age.

24:21.795 --> 24:23.797
Some is mental, you know,

24:24.005 --> 24:26.508
living with the loss
of our loved ones.

24:26.716 --> 24:29.219
If you think about it,
whether we fight that pain

24:29.428 --> 24:32.013
or succumb to it,
the result is the same.

24:32.222 --> 24:33.890
It diminishes our lives,

24:34.099 --> 24:36.017
robs us of our passions
and pastimes

24:36.226 --> 24:39.396
and damages relationships
between friends and lovers.

24:39.604 --> 24:41.314
What if I told you
that there's

24:41.481 --> 24:43.483
a simple way
to eliminate that pain?

24:43.692 --> 24:46.153
I'd say
you're full of crap.

24:47.863 --> 24:50.991
There's no simple way
to eliminate pain,

24:51.199 --> 24:53.535
and you know it.

24:53.743 --> 24:55.912
So much suffering.

24:56.121 --> 24:58.999
If we get her,
the others will come.

25:03.545 --> 25:07.382
This can make it
go away.

25:08.633 --> 25:10.802
Heh. Please.

25:11.011 --> 25:14.264
The key to
the city of light,

25:14.473 --> 25:17.267
to your salvation
and relief.

25:19.603 --> 25:21.521
OK. OK.

25:21.730 --> 25:24.024
You're telling
these people what,

25:24.232 --> 25:25.942
that they swallow that,
and they'll be living

25:26.151 --> 25:29.446
in happy town for
the rest of their lives?

25:30.697 --> 25:32.449
You should be
ashamed of yourself.

25:34.784 --> 25:37.871
- We need her.
- She's not ready.

25:39.998 --> 25:42.542
I'll be here
when you are.

25:47.464 --> 25:49.508
Kindly
move forward.

25:52.761 --> 25:56.097
Straight ahead.
Move.

25:56.306 --> 25:59.434
Pick up your feet. Come on.

26:01.311 --> 26:03.230
Lincoln. Lincoln.

26:03.438 --> 26:05.440
I'm OK. Don't fight this.

26:05.649 --> 26:07.108
He's right.

26:07.317 --> 26:08.944
Lincoln, what the hell
is going on?

26:09.152 --> 26:10.904
We're interning
the grounders.

26:11.112 --> 26:13.114
Lincoln's here because of
a disturbance in sick bay.

26:13.323 --> 26:14.324
Last one.
Let's go.

26:16.952 --> 26:19.204
- What's happening to you?
- Octavia--

26:19.412 --> 26:21.915
I saw what you and pike
did to Lexa's army.

26:22.123 --> 26:24.042
Bellamy, you
killed everyone.

26:27.254 --> 26:29.297
- Keep your voice down.
- What's wrong?

26:29.506 --> 26:31.341
You're not proud
of massacring an army

26:31.550 --> 26:32.551
that was here
to help us?

26:32.759 --> 26:34.261
We're not
doing this here.

26:34.469 --> 26:36.805
Good. Then let's go because
I'm not even close to done.

26:46.856 --> 26:48.567
You need to be
careful, o.

26:48.775 --> 26:50.652
If you keep this up, I won't
be able to protect you.

26:50.860 --> 26:52.153
Thanks for
the warning.

26:52.362 --> 26:55.156
I'm serious.
Look at yourself.

26:55.365 --> 26:57.200
It is time to stop
playing grounder

26:57.409 --> 26:58.660
before you get
yourself hurt.

26:58.868 --> 27:00.620
I'm not playing anything.
This is who I am.

27:00.829 --> 27:02.205
You're my brother.

27:02.414 --> 27:04.249
I shouldn't have
to tell you that.

27:13.758 --> 27:15.093
Now I'm done.

27:29.274 --> 27:31.610
Go easy on Octavia.

27:31.818 --> 27:34.237
I had to beg her
to get me into camp.

27:34.446 --> 27:36.239
What are you
doing here, Clarke?

27:36.448 --> 27:37.532
We need to talk.

27:37.741 --> 27:39.701
Oh, you've
decided that,

27:39.909 --> 27:41.786
the mighty Wanheda

27:41.995 --> 27:43.622
who chose the grounders
over her own people,

27:43.830 --> 27:46.333
who turned her back on us
when we came to rescue you.

27:46.541 --> 27:48.251
Now you want to talk.

27:48.460 --> 27:51.212
I came here to tell you
that the ice nation

27:51.421 --> 27:53.632
has paid a price.

27:53.840 --> 27:55.592
Justice
has been served

27:55.800 --> 27:56.843
for the attack
on mount weather.

27:57.052 --> 27:59.012
I came here to
tell you it's over.

27:59.220 --> 28:00.847
There it is again.

28:01.056 --> 28:02.557
Why do you get
to decide it's over?

28:02.766 --> 28:04.351
We did our part.

28:04.559 --> 28:06.061
We?

28:06.269 --> 28:07.729
Lexa and I.

28:09.439 --> 28:11.232
The ice queen
is dead.

28:11.441 --> 28:12.651
The problem was solved,
and then you

28:12.859 --> 28:16.404
let pike
ruin everything.

28:16.613 --> 28:18.865
Why are you here,
Clarke?

28:19.074 --> 28:21.868
Arkadia needs to
make things right,

28:22.077 --> 28:24.704
or Lexa and the twelve
clans will wipe us out.

28:24.913 --> 28:27.040
Let her try.

28:27.248 --> 28:29.417
Please tell me

28:29.626 --> 28:32.087
that going to war is
not what you want.

28:36.675 --> 28:40.136
We've been at war
since we landed.

28:40.345 --> 28:42.180
At least pike
understands that.

28:42.389 --> 28:45.100
Pike is the problem.

28:45.308 --> 28:47.018
This isn't
who you are.

28:47.227 --> 28:49.062
You're wrong.

28:49.270 --> 28:52.607
This is who
I've always been,

28:52.816 --> 28:55.527
and I let you and Octavia
and Kane convince me

28:55.735 --> 28:57.654
that we could trust
these people

28:57.862 --> 29:00.448
when they have shown
over and over who they are,

29:00.657 --> 29:03.243
and I won't let anyone else
die for that mistake.

29:03.410 --> 29:05.912
Bellamy...

29:06.121 --> 29:07.914
I need you,

29:08.123 --> 29:10.250
and we don't have
much time.

29:10.458 --> 29:11.710
You need me?

29:11.918 --> 29:13.294
Yes. I do.

29:13.503 --> 29:16.131
I need the guy
who wouldn't let me

29:16.339 --> 29:18.466
pull that lever in
mount weather by myself.

29:18.675 --> 29:20.802
You left me.
You left everyone.

29:21.010 --> 29:22.387
- Bellamy--
- enough, Clarke.

29:22.595 --> 29:24.973
You are not in charge here,
and that's a good thing

29:25.181 --> 29:28.268
because people die
when you're in charge.

29:28.435 --> 29:31.062
You were willing to let
a bomb drop on my sister.

29:31.271 --> 29:32.856
Then you made
a deal with Lexa,

29:33.064 --> 29:34.774
who left us in
mount weather to die

29:34.983 --> 29:38.027
and forced us to kill
everyone who helped us,

29:38.236 --> 29:40.655
people who trusted me.

29:44.534 --> 29:46.828
I--

30:01.551 --> 30:03.303
I'm sorry.

30:10.685 --> 30:12.771
I'm sorry for leaving.

30:17.400 --> 30:20.904
I knew I could
because they had you.

30:48.515 --> 30:50.934
I know
we can fix this.

30:53.853 --> 30:56.064
I'm sorry, too.

31:02.529 --> 31:03.696
Hey.

31:05.740 --> 31:07.700
No. Don't. No.

31:07.909 --> 31:11.079
Bellamy, don't. God--

31:14.541 --> 31:16.167
oh...

31:27.720 --> 31:31.391
Zero-g mechanic sorting
scrap metal out for ammo, huh?

31:37.272 --> 31:38.439
Was this Abby's idea?

31:38.648 --> 31:41.025
Is it supposed
to make you feel better?

31:45.321 --> 31:46.948
I can help you,
raven.

31:47.156 --> 31:49.033
Don't, all right?

31:49.242 --> 31:51.035
Everyone thinks
they have an idea

31:51.244 --> 31:53.162
on how to help me
feel better--

31:53.371 --> 31:54.998
stay in camp,

31:55.206 --> 31:57.041
only do jobs where
I can sit down,

31:57.250 --> 31:58.668
ask every time
I need something

31:58.877 --> 32:01.379
on a high shelf--
but you know what?

32:01.588 --> 32:03.590
I'm not that person.

32:03.798 --> 32:04.883
People think
I can just change

32:05.091 --> 32:07.385
and my pain will go
away, but I can't.

32:07.594 --> 32:10.179
I can't do that,
and I can't do this.

32:29.073 --> 32:31.159
What have you
got to lose?

32:42.003 --> 32:43.963
Pike should be
in his quarters.

32:44.172 --> 32:45.673
Bellamy, you don't
have to do this.

32:45.882 --> 32:46.966
Yes, I do.

32:47.175 --> 32:48.301
Just let me go.

32:48.509 --> 32:49.552
Believe it or not,

32:49.761 --> 32:51.220
I am doing this
for your own good.

32:51.429 --> 32:54.974
Believe it or not,
I'm doing this for yours.

32:55.183 --> 32:57.518
You can't just
hit a guard.

32:57.727 --> 32:59.228
I just did.
Let her go.

32:59.437 --> 33:00.980
I can't do that.

33:02.440 --> 33:03.775
They're coming.

33:03.983 --> 33:05.818
You should go.

33:07.528 --> 33:09.238
Uh...Uh!

33:12.825 --> 33:14.327
Clarke, hurry up.

33:14.535 --> 33:15.495
Get them on deck two.

33:15.703 --> 33:17.372
- Let's go.
- Follow me.

33:17.580 --> 33:18.581
Come on.

33:23.586 --> 33:24.754
Mom.

33:24.963 --> 33:27.173
We know what happened.
We know what pike did.

33:27.382 --> 33:30.176
Is there anything we can do
to prevent a retaliation?

33:30.343 --> 33:31.427
Abby, hurry.

33:31.636 --> 33:33.262
We came here to
give them pike.

33:33.471 --> 33:35.974
He's the duly elected
chancellor.

33:36.182 --> 33:38.101
Our people knew
what they were voting for.

33:38.309 --> 33:41.020
Besides, he has the guards
and all the guns.

33:41.229 --> 33:42.355
Can't get close to him.

33:42.563 --> 33:44.065
And that's not the
way we do things.

33:44.273 --> 33:45.233
Then maybe it's
time we change

33:45.441 --> 33:46.693
the way
we do things.

33:46.901 --> 33:48.778
Security breach.
Lock down the exits.

33:48.987 --> 33:50.279
You two need
to go now.

33:50.488 --> 33:52.073
What about
Lincoln?

33:52.281 --> 33:55.410
You want to help him, do it
from the outside with this.

33:55.618 --> 33:56.869
The range isn't great.

33:57.036 --> 33:59.205
You stay close and wait
for me to contact you.

33:59.414 --> 34:00.915
Now go.

34:03.543 --> 34:05.294
Come with me.

34:05.503 --> 34:07.505
I wish I could.

34:09.716 --> 34:11.259
May we meet again.

34:33.114 --> 34:36.993
I do a much better job
of making you look dead.

34:38.411 --> 34:40.038
Your brother--

34:40.246 --> 34:43.583
it can wait until
I can convince you

34:43.750 --> 34:47.003
to join me,
which I will.

34:50.256 --> 34:52.550
Perfect timing.

35:20.161 --> 35:22.914
We know you're not alone.
Where's the girl?

35:23.122 --> 35:26.084
She left.

35:26.292 --> 35:28.461
Find her.
On your knees.

35:28.669 --> 35:30.671
You've been caught stealing
in the commander's woods.

35:30.880 --> 35:32.673
The punishment
for this is death.

35:32.882 --> 35:35.426
I'll ask you once more--
where's the girl?

35:35.635 --> 35:37.887
Go float yourself.

35:46.854 --> 35:48.564
Where did you get this?

35:51.109 --> 35:54.153
I guess if you kill me now,
you'll never find out.

35:54.362 --> 35:57.323
On your feet. Move.

35:59.325 --> 36:01.410
Keep walking.

36:09.377 --> 36:11.504
Careful.

36:11.712 --> 36:15.341
This one doesn't like
to be chained up.

36:18.177 --> 36:20.972
Girlfriend's not here
to free you this time.

36:34.735 --> 36:37.780
It's from Abby
for Danae.

36:39.240 --> 36:41.033
Octavia?

36:41.242 --> 36:43.536
She got out
with Clarke.

37:08.978 --> 37:10.479
Heda...

37:21.240 --> 37:22.575
Where's Octavia?

37:22.783 --> 37:24.452
She's watching
over camp.

37:24.660 --> 37:27.288
So tell us, Clarke,
how does this end?

37:29.248 --> 37:31.709
Have you come up with a way
to save your people yet again?

37:31.918 --> 37:35.671
No. Only you
can do that.

37:35.880 --> 37:38.382
What happened here
was an act of war.

37:38.591 --> 37:40.134
Your army was here
to help us,

37:40.343 --> 37:42.803
and my people
slaughtered them.

37:43.012 --> 37:45.932
You have every right
to respond,

37:46.140 --> 37:49.518
every right
to wipe us out,

37:49.727 --> 37:53.147
or you can change
the way you do things.

37:53.356 --> 37:55.900
Why should
she change?

37:56.108 --> 37:58.236
Blood must have blood.

37:58.444 --> 38:00.655
Really? Because
from where I stand,

38:00.863 --> 38:03.741
the only way that ends
is with everyone dead.

38:05.660 --> 38:09.121
So what kind of leader
do you want to be,

38:09.330 --> 38:11.499
the kind who kills
every chance she gets

38:11.707 --> 38:13.542
because
that's your way

38:13.751 --> 38:17.129
or the kind who shows
the world a better way.

38:17.296 --> 38:19.173
You consider
letting a massacre

38:19.382 --> 38:20.841
go unavenged
a better way?

38:21.050 --> 38:23.678
If it ends a cycle
of violence, yes.

38:23.886 --> 38:27.056
If it brings about
peace, yes.

38:27.265 --> 38:30.351
Someone has to take
the first step.

38:32.103 --> 38:34.355
Let it be you.

38:38.484 --> 38:41.320
You say
you want peace.

38:41.529 --> 38:43.739
Everything you've done
was to achieve that,

38:43.948 --> 38:45.491
yet here we stand
on the brink

38:45.658 --> 38:49.287
of another war, a
war you could stop.

38:51.956 --> 38:53.624
Commander,

38:53.833 --> 38:56.627
you can't seriously
be considering this.

39:01.382 --> 39:03.551
I'm not considering it.

39:06.846 --> 39:08.472
I'm doing it.

39:08.681 --> 39:09.682
Heda, please.

39:09.890 --> 39:11.726
Indra, our people

39:11.934 --> 39:14.145
act as if war
is easier than peace.

39:14.353 --> 39:16.689
If that's so, should we not
try and achieve

39:16.897 --> 39:19.108
the more difficult goal?

39:19.317 --> 39:21.027
Polis will not
support you.

39:21.235 --> 39:22.528
Titus--

39:22.737 --> 39:26.574
Titus is my subject.
They're all my subjects.

39:29.035 --> 39:31.287
Do you say
they will defy me?

39:33.873 --> 39:36.959
Will you defy me?

39:37.168 --> 39:40.379
No, Heda.
I will not.

39:40.588 --> 39:42.465
Then let it be known.

39:47.303 --> 39:49.972
Blood must not
have blood.
