WEBVTT

00:10.300 --> 00:12.300
- Stop.
- What?

00:12.600 --> 00:14.900
Slurping. You know
I can't stand that noise.

00:15.200 --> 00:17.700
Sorry. I'm finished anyway.

00:18.000 --> 00:21.100
Hey. Don't throw
that used milk out.

00:23.200 --> 00:26.500
Impertinent, yet lightly frosted.

00:26.800 --> 00:28.200
Talk about annoying noises.

00:30.900 --> 00:33.300
Fine. I'll answer my e-mail later.

00:35.300 --> 00:38.400
- You're doing that on purpose.
- I chipped a nail.

00:38.600 --> 00:40.200
Now I'm doing it on purpose.

00:41.500 --> 00:43.400
Two can play at that game, sister.

00:46.300 --> 00:48.400
Why, you...

00:50.800 --> 00:52.900
Care for a little squeaky balloon,
my pretty?

00:56.100 --> 00:57.700
This means war.

01:02.000 --> 01:03.400
Stop!

01:03.500 --> 01:06.000
Can we please have a little
peace and quiet around here?

01:06.300 --> 01:07.400
She's right.

01:08.400 --> 01:10.900
Let's get her.

01:12.000 --> 01:18.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:29.300 --> 01:31.200
I'm such a nut.

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
So you think you guys
really need some time apart?

01:40.200 --> 01:42.700
Yes, after five centuries
of living together,

01:43.000 --> 01:44.800
we're starting to get
on each other's nerves.

01:45.100 --> 01:46.100
We haven't bickered much

01:46.400 --> 01:48.300
since we picked opposite sides
in the Civil War.

01:48.400 --> 01:50.000
So why are you two going
to the same spa?

01:50.300 --> 01:52.800
- They had a two-for-one special.
- But we have separate rooms.

01:53.100 --> 01:54.700
We're not even gonna
see each other.

01:54.900 --> 01:57.100
You packed my toothbrush, right?

01:59.700 --> 02:00.700
Hi.

02:01.000 --> 02:02.600
It's Cousin Marigold.

02:02.700 --> 02:04.200
She wants to talk to one of you.

02:05.800 --> 02:07.000
No me. You talk to her.

02:07.300 --> 02:08.699
No, you talk to her.

02:09.800 --> 02:13.100
- Somebody talk to her.
- Fine.

02:13.400 --> 02:15.100
Hello, Marigold.

02:16.800 --> 02:17.700
Oh, darn.

02:17.900 --> 02:20.400
We'd love to babysit Amanda,
but we can't, we're going away.

02:20.800 --> 02:22.100
Oh, God bless the spa.

02:22.600 --> 02:25.600
Sabrina? No, no, no,
that's a very bad idea.

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
Sabrina doesn't need $100.

02:28.100 --> 02:30.600
- Hey!
- Could you hold a minute?

02:31.400 --> 02:32.600
It's not worth it, honey.

02:32.800 --> 02:34.600
I wouldn't take that brat
for less than a grand.

02:34.900 --> 02:36.500
I think I can handle a 9-year-old.

02:36.800 --> 02:40.200
Sabrina, Amanda's a full witch.
You're half-mortal.

02:40.600 --> 02:41.800
Just a minute.

02:42.000 --> 02:43.600
I wanna do this.

02:44.500 --> 02:47.600
Hi, Marigold?
Yeah, I'll watch Amanda.

02:47.800 --> 02:49.500
Great. I can't wait.

02:49.800 --> 02:50.800
Okay, thanks.

02:51.900 --> 02:55.200
Amanda says we'll be having fun
before I know it.

02:56.400 --> 02:58.700
Oh, dear.
Amanda was able to do that

02:59.000 --> 03:00.500
all the way from the Other Realm.

03:02.500 --> 03:05.700
L... I'm just practicing
for a beauty pageant.

03:08.900 --> 03:11.200
- Okay, you have our number.
- Keep the doors locked.

03:11.500 --> 03:12.900
And don't forget to feed the cat.

03:13.200 --> 03:14.900
I've got it.

03:15.400 --> 03:17.000
Oh, well, Amanda's here.

03:17.100 --> 03:20.200
Hello, I'm here to relinquish a minor
to a Miss Sabrina Spellman.

03:20.600 --> 03:22.600
- That's me. Hi, Amanda.
- Hi.

03:22.900 --> 03:25.600
- I hope she wasn't too much trouble.
- I'm retiring.

03:25.900 --> 03:28.100
Thank you for flying
Other Realm Air.

03:28.700 --> 03:30.500
I saved my peanuts
for us to have together.

03:30.700 --> 03:32.600
Thanks. See, we're sharing.

03:32.900 --> 03:34.900
Well, okay, we're off to the spa.

03:37.200 --> 03:38.800
- What do you have there?
- My toy box.

03:39.100 --> 03:40.400
I never leave home without it.

03:41.600 --> 03:43.300
That's okay, it was just a bone.

03:44.400 --> 03:46.700
Amanda, I have some crayons
and colouring books.

03:47.000 --> 03:48.300
Knock yourself out.

03:49.000 --> 03:50.300
I wanna play with this.

03:50.600 --> 03:52.500
Oh, no, Harvey gave me that.
Please, put that down.

03:53.100 --> 03:56.300
- But I'm the guest.
- Amanda, I've asked you nicely.

03:56.600 --> 03:58.400
- Give it to me.
- I wanna play with it!

04:01.400 --> 04:02.600
Okay, you can have it.

04:02.900 --> 04:04.100
That's okay.

04:04.300 --> 04:07.400
I'm sure Harvey's family
has other priceless heirlooms.

04:07.900 --> 04:10.900
- Kitty, you wanna play?
- I don't do play.

04:11.200 --> 04:12.300
But you're so small.

04:12.600 --> 04:13.900
I like things big.

04:15.400 --> 04:17.100
Salem?

04:18.300 --> 04:20.000
Amanda, he's not declawed.
Turn him back.

04:20.200 --> 04:21.800
Fine.

04:23.400 --> 04:27.400
I wanted to eat you. I feel so cheap.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.600
Welcome to Celestial Bodies,

04:31.700 --> 04:33.700
where you can feel
supernatural naturally.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.200
Complimentary seaweed juice?

04:35.400 --> 04:37.000
Like there's any other kind.

04:37.300 --> 04:39.100
It may be seaweed,
but with our special blend,

04:39.400 --> 04:40.900
you'll swear it's soy milk.

04:41.000 --> 04:43.300
- Tangy.
- It's the seaweediest.

04:43.800 --> 04:45.700
I'll have someone
show you to your room.

04:46.200 --> 04:48.400
- Rooms.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

04:48.700 --> 04:50.800
We saw "Spellman for two"
and assumed you were married.

04:51.300 --> 04:53.600
But now you see that
you were very, very wrong.

04:53.900 --> 04:55.600
Lawsuit wrong.

04:56.200 --> 04:57.900
It is near the ice machine.

05:01.400 --> 05:03.300
Yes! I win!

05:03.600 --> 05:05.600
I win, I win, I win.

05:05.900 --> 05:07.300
You've beaten me at all these games

05:07.500 --> 05:09.800
and yet you remain
a graceful winner.

05:11.300 --> 05:12.400
Let's put makeup on Salem.

05:12.700 --> 05:15.300
I'm not playing <i>La Cage aux Kitty.</i>

05:15.600 --> 05:18.000
We've been playing for hours.
I've got an idea.

05:18.200 --> 05:20.900
- Let's play Being Apart.
- No.

05:21.200 --> 05:22.500
I want you to play with me.

05:23.100 --> 05:24.800
Why don't you watch TV?

05:25.100 --> 05:27.200
<i>I said, play with me!</i>

05:28.400 --> 05:30.800
Amanda, get out of the TV.
You're gonna ruin your eyes.

05:31.100 --> 05:33.400
<i>But I wanna play!</i>

05:35.900 --> 05:37.000
- Hey.
- Hey. What's up?

05:37.200 --> 05:39.800
Not much. Just yelling
at something annoying on the TV.

05:40.000 --> 05:42.500
- I was just invited to a party.
- At 7:00?

05:42.700 --> 05:45.300
Well, I wasn't exactly invited,
but people saw me hear about it

05:45.600 --> 05:47.500
and didn't warn me to keep away.
You wanna come?

05:47.700 --> 05:50.300
Gee, I'd love to since they went to
so much trouble not to ban us,

05:50.600 --> 05:52.500
but I can't.
I'm babysitting my little cousin.

05:52.700 --> 05:54.300
Well, I can't go to a party alone.

05:54.600 --> 05:57.300
Let me change that.
I can't go to another party alone.

05:58.100 --> 06:00.700
- All right, someone new to play with.
- Oh, she's so cute.

06:01.100 --> 06:03.100
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
What's your blood type?

06:07.400 --> 06:09.500
Goody. Minibar.

06:12.200 --> 06:13.200
Martini?

06:13.500 --> 06:14.700
Don't waste your money on that.

06:14.900 --> 06:17.200
There's a convenience mart
right across the galaxy.

06:17.500 --> 06:19.500
You have gotta
get into the spa spirit.

06:19.800 --> 06:22.300
I'll have a seltzer with lemon, please.

06:27.100 --> 06:30.100
- Macadamia nuts?
- Now you're pushing it.

06:30.600 --> 06:32.800
There's so much to choose from.

06:33.100 --> 06:36.100
I think I'll have
the solar bronzing treatment.

06:36.500 --> 06:38.200
<i>Solar bronzing treatment, confirmed.</i>

06:38.600 --> 06:41.900
- I want one of those.
- <i>Solar bronzing treatment, confirmed.</i>

06:42.100 --> 06:43.100
Quit copying.

06:43.400 --> 06:46.500
The point was to spend
quality time away from each other.

06:46.700 --> 06:49.300
<i>Solar bronzing treatment, cancelled.</i>

06:49.600 --> 06:52.000
Guess I'll just go
with an essential honey dip.

06:52.300 --> 06:55.000
"You are dipped
into a human-size beehive.

06:55.300 --> 06:58.800
You emerge soft and supple
with just a little bit of a buzz."

06:59.200 --> 07:01.000
Cool. I'm gonna do that.

07:01.300 --> 07:02.800
<i>Essential honey dip, confirmed.</i>

07:03.000 --> 07:05.800
Hilda, pick something else.

07:06.100 --> 07:08.100
Okay.

07:10.100 --> 07:12.200
<i>Essential honey dip, cancelled.</i>

07:12.400 --> 07:14.100
I'll have the essential honey dip.

07:16.900 --> 07:18.100
Am I confirmed?

07:18.300 --> 07:22.600
<i>Okay. I can see why</i>
<i>you wanted two rooms.</i>

07:25.000 --> 07:26.200
Who ordered the honey dip?

07:26.500 --> 07:27.800
- Me.
- Me.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.100
Follow me, ladies.

07:30.900 --> 07:33.100
Why don't we just have
someone sew us together?

07:33.300 --> 07:35.100
I hope you get a bee up your nose.

07:37.800 --> 07:38.900
Yes!

07:39.000 --> 07:42.300
I win, I win.

07:42.700 --> 07:44.900
Of course, of course.

07:45.200 --> 07:48.000
She always has the right cards.
It's like magic or something.

07:49.300 --> 07:51.800
Just talk. Nothing more, okay?

07:53.600 --> 07:55.300
I'm from the fourth galaxy
of the Other Realm.

07:55.600 --> 07:56.800
Where are you from?

07:57.000 --> 07:59.500
I'm from a big castle
in never-never land.

07:59.900 --> 08:01.000
You're delusional.

08:02.500 --> 08:04.200
Harvey. Hi.

08:04.300 --> 08:05.700
Word's out that there's a party.

08:05.900 --> 08:08.400
Wow, I actually got the word first?

08:08.600 --> 08:11.800
Looks like my popularity
standing's on the rise.

08:12.100 --> 08:13.400
I am delusional.

08:14.800 --> 08:17.200
I wanna go to the party.
I wanna go to the party.

08:17.400 --> 08:19.200
No way.
You can't leave this house.

08:19.300 --> 08:21.400
I want to go to the party!

08:21.600 --> 08:24.300
She's kind of having a meltdown.
Maybe you guys should go.

08:24.600 --> 08:27.000
Well, will you act
like you're with me?

08:27.200 --> 08:28.900
Sure.

08:29.100 --> 08:30.700
And call me Cookie?

08:32.000 --> 08:33.299
Is something burning?

08:33.500 --> 08:35.900
Let me know how the party is.

08:37.100 --> 08:38.600
So, what do you wanna play now?

08:38.799 --> 08:41.700
A hundred dollars sounded
like so much money.

08:42.299 --> 08:43.500
Amanda, I have to clean up.

08:43.700 --> 08:45.300
Don't you have a doll
you can play with?

08:45.500 --> 08:47.300
Good idea.

08:49.800 --> 08:51.300
We're gonna have so much fun.

08:51.500 --> 08:53.400
You are in so much trouble,
young lady.

08:58.100 --> 08:59.600
Want a little more tea?

08:59.800 --> 09:01.700
I'll be right back
with some more crumpets.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.100
- This is so humiliating.
- You?

09:04.400 --> 09:06.000
I'm wearing pantaloons.

09:06.100 --> 09:07.900
How did this happen?
I'm the big witch.

09:08.200 --> 09:10.800
Look the other way when you talk.
You're creeping me out.

09:11.300 --> 09:12.200
Here we go.

09:12.500 --> 09:13.700
Okay, Amanda, we've had fun.

09:13.800 --> 09:15.600
Turn me back,
I'll help you get ready for bed.

09:15.900 --> 09:18.100
I'm not going to bed,
you're going to bed.

09:18.300 --> 09:21.000
And Salem and I
are going to stay up and play.

09:22.200 --> 09:23.800
You're not gonna
get away with...

09:25.600 --> 09:28.300
- Welcome to the box.
- Who are you?

09:28.500 --> 09:30.000
I was an ice-cream man.

09:30.300 --> 09:32.300
Then I told Amanda
we were out of chocolate.

09:32.600 --> 09:34.000
You don't have a cigarette, do you?

09:36.600 --> 09:38.200
I'm Carol.

09:38.400 --> 09:41.100
I used to be her hairdresser.
Now she's mine.

09:41.400 --> 09:42.500
Felt-tip pen.

09:42.700 --> 09:44.000
Ouch.

09:44.200 --> 09:45.200
I'm Dr. Rafkin.

09:45.400 --> 09:47.300
L... I used to be
Amanda's dentist,

09:47.600 --> 09:51.500
but now, I'm a... An action figure.

09:51.900 --> 09:56.400
- So, what are your powers?
- I sleep about 18 hours a day.

09:56.800 --> 09:58.100
So, what's your story?

09:58.200 --> 10:00.700
Well, I'm Sabrina,
and I was Amanda's babysitter.

10:01.100 --> 10:02.800
Sabrina, you're never
getting out of here.

10:03.000 --> 10:04.400
None of us are getting out of here.

10:04.700 --> 10:06.800
I think somebody needs a hug.

10:07.100 --> 10:09.200
It's an accessory.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.200
Oh, that honey dip was great.

10:13.500 --> 10:14.900
But my bee was such a talker.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.700
She just droned on and on.

10:17.000 --> 10:21.800
Mine was such a name-dropper.
"The queen this and the queen that."

10:22.200 --> 10:24.600
Hi, ladies.
Sorry about the room mix-up.

10:24.900 --> 10:26.200
But this might cheer you up.

10:26.400 --> 10:29.100
I just heard that Madame Eppie
Dermis has had a cancellation.

10:29.400 --> 10:30.400
The Madame Dermis?

10:30.500 --> 10:32.500
She's the most famous facialist
in all the Realm.

10:32.800 --> 10:35.300
I've heard she has to book her
appointments 50 years in advance.

10:35.600 --> 10:37.500
Her technique is so fabulous
that your face feels

10:37.800 --> 10:40.000
as if it's actually been grafted
with baby-butt skin.

10:40.200 --> 10:42.700
- I want a baby-butt-skin face.
- No, I do.

10:42.900 --> 10:45.500
Well, one of you should grab
that once-in-a-lifetime appointment.

10:45.900 --> 10:46.900
Dibs!

10:47.000 --> 10:48.900
Wait. We can't do this.

10:49.100 --> 10:52.400
If one of us takes that facial,
the other will always resent it.

10:52.700 --> 10:53.700
You're right.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.700
- It's worth it.
- No.

10:57.000 --> 10:59.600
Oh, fine.
Then we'll both be unhappy.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.800
Yes, unhappy,
but free from resentment.

11:05.200 --> 11:07.600
Well, not right away.

11:10.400 --> 11:12.600
Come on, you guys.
There's gotta be a way out of here.

11:12.900 --> 11:15.300
There is a front door,
we just never use it.

11:17.700 --> 11:18.900
Where's my other shoe?

11:19.100 --> 11:21.400
You're a doll,
you'll never have two shoes again.

11:21.700 --> 11:24.600
I can figure this out.
I've just got to use my...

11:24.900 --> 11:26.500
Rubber head?

11:28.300 --> 11:29.900
I've got an idea.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.700
Amanda! Amanda!

11:33.000 --> 11:36.500
- The new ones are so optimistic.
- Could you not talk to me?

11:37.200 --> 11:38.700
What? I'm playing giddyap
with Salem.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.900
Who is it? Please,
someone feed me poison.

11:42.300 --> 11:44.300
Amanda, I have to go
to the bathroom.

11:44.500 --> 11:46.100
You're not a Betsy Wetsy.

11:48.300 --> 11:49.500
Was that fresh air?

11:50.500 --> 11:52.900
You're not a Betsy Wetsy, are you?

11:53.100 --> 11:56.400
And up and down,
and up and down,

11:56.600 --> 11:59.500
and up and down, and up...

11:59.900 --> 12:02.400
I hate my life!

12:03.000 --> 12:05.500
You know, Sabrina,
we've all been out of the box.

12:05.800 --> 12:07.300
- Really?
- The problem is,

12:07.500 --> 12:12.100
you're still only 10 inches tall
and real easy to step on.

12:12.500 --> 12:15.100
I spent two weeks
in a vacuum cleaner once.

12:15.300 --> 12:17.200
Ate a penny to stay alive.

12:17.500 --> 12:20.200
She's never gonna change us back.

12:20.500 --> 12:23.700
Dr. Rafkin, superheroes don't whine.

12:23.900 --> 12:28.100
I'm not a superhero,
I'm a periodontist.

12:28.400 --> 12:31.200
I drive a station wagon.

12:31.500 --> 12:34.100
Well, it's official. I'm in hell.

12:34.400 --> 12:36.900
- It's too bad that phone doesn't work.
- I do.

12:37.300 --> 12:39.600
- I was Amanda's next-door neighbour.
- Don't ask.

12:41.700 --> 12:43.300
Watch my nine, I'm ticklish.

12:43.600 --> 12:45.900
I'll just call my aunts
and they'll fix everything.

12:46.200 --> 12:47.700
Love the gingham.

12:47.900 --> 12:49.900
Great! You can fix everything.

12:50.400 --> 12:53.500
No, I can't. I'm here to give you
a quiz for your witch's licence.

12:54.000 --> 12:55.700
I'm never gonna be happy
to see you, am I?

12:56.000 --> 12:57.800
But, Sabrina, this is
the perfect opportunity

12:58.000 --> 13:01.200
to test you on your witch ingenuity.

13:01.400 --> 13:04.100
Don't make me hurt you.
Get me out of this box.

13:04.400 --> 13:08.200
- And take us with you.
- Or at least take him.

13:08.500 --> 13:10.500
Sorry, guys.
Amanda locked the spell.

13:10.800 --> 13:12.800
Sabrina, your quiz is that
you have to get everyone

13:13.100 --> 13:14.700
out of this box by yourself.

13:15.000 --> 13:17.700
Now, isn't learning fun?

13:20.000 --> 13:21.300
"Isn't learning fun?"

13:22.300 --> 13:26.400
There's gotta be a way out of here.
I've just gotta think.

13:27.200 --> 13:29.200
I'm blind! I'm blind!

13:29.400 --> 13:30.400
Sit up.

13:30.600 --> 13:32.400
You're just not used
to your doll eyes.

13:32.700 --> 13:33.600
That's better.

13:33.800 --> 13:34.800
Way to go.

13:35.100 --> 13:37.800
That could have entertained us
for at least a minute.

13:40.600 --> 13:42.800
Thank you for talking me
into buying these.

13:43.100 --> 13:45.500
I love your daisy shoesies.

13:47.700 --> 13:50.700
You know, that noise isn't
making me want to rip my skin off.

13:51.000 --> 13:54.000
I know. It's amazing.
You haven't bugged me in hours.

13:55.000 --> 13:57.100
I think I'm gonna go for a little walk.
You wanna come?

13:57.400 --> 13:59.300
No. I'm in the mood for a little nap.

13:59.800 --> 14:02.800
Well, then I'll just
walk by myself, then.

14:05.800 --> 14:07.600
You know what makes
a great sleep aid?

14:08.300 --> 14:10.300
Belgian chocolates.

14:14.100 --> 14:17.700
Okay, I think I have a plan,
and I'll need your help.

14:18.200 --> 14:20.300
You can really read people,
can't you?

14:20.600 --> 14:23.200
Come on, if we band our talents
together, I know we can do it.

14:23.600 --> 14:24.900
There's power in numbers.

14:25.000 --> 14:26.900
It takes a village. Cry freedom!

14:28.700 --> 14:29.900
Nothing?

14:30.100 --> 14:31.300
I'll help you, Sabrina.

14:32.300 --> 14:33.400
Like we're so busy.

14:33.600 --> 14:38.000
I'm in. But you should know
that I have no upper-body strength.

14:38.900 --> 14:41.000
Come on, Ralphie.
Power to the toys.

14:41.300 --> 14:44.100
Fine. It'll give me something fresh
to be bitter about.

14:44.300 --> 14:45.300
All right.

14:45.500 --> 14:47.700
Power to the toys!
Power to the toys!

14:49.700 --> 14:50.800
Let's get to work.

15:30.400 --> 15:34.300
Salem, time to play cat hospital.

15:35.500 --> 15:37.500
This cotton swab is way too small.

15:38.400 --> 15:39.400
I like things big.

15:40.600 --> 15:43.800
Somebody needs their ears cleaned.

15:44.600 --> 15:45.700
Salem...

15:50.700 --> 15:52.700
Okay, everybody,
you know what to do.

15:52.900 --> 15:57.000
How do you know
when you're bleeding internally?

15:58.700 --> 16:00.900
What else could I do with this?

16:07.200 --> 16:09.000
What's that noise?

16:09.900 --> 16:12.600
- Oh, yeah!
- Yeah! Party!

16:12.900 --> 16:14.500
Oh, please.
I've had enough therapy

16:14.600 --> 16:17.000
to know not to fall
for reverse psychology.

16:18.500 --> 16:20.200
What's this?

16:20.700 --> 16:22.000
A new toy?

16:22.200 --> 16:24.200
It's kind of small.

16:26.500 --> 16:28.100
Bigger is always better.

16:36.300 --> 16:37.800
Now it's my turn to play.

16:38.000 --> 16:39.600
Oh, yeah?

16:43.200 --> 16:46.400
I'm gonna have my mom
stop payment on your check.

16:47.000 --> 16:49.200
- Hello.
- So it looks like I passed, huh?

16:49.300 --> 16:52.000
Yep. Once again,
you got yourself out of the mess

16:52.400 --> 16:53.500
you got yourself into.

16:53.700 --> 16:55.100
I'll take that as a "well done."

16:55.400 --> 16:57.400
Now, you're too big
for stickers, right?

16:57.700 --> 16:58.800
- Yeah.
- Yes.

16:59.000 --> 17:00.800
More for me. Toodles.

17:02.800 --> 17:05.400
Hey, guys, gather your accessories.
You're going home.

17:05.599 --> 17:08.099
Yeah! Yes! We're all happy!

17:08.300 --> 17:10.800
And nobody needs to touch me.

17:12.599 --> 17:16.500
Oh, you badly needed a face peel.

17:17.700 --> 17:20.000
This face is so dirty.

17:22.000 --> 17:23.599
There, you dry now.

17:27.500 --> 17:30.100
- Hello, Madame Dermis?
- What do you want from me?

17:30.300 --> 17:31.700
I would like to make an appointment

17:32.000 --> 17:35.500
for one of your Realm-renowned
baby-butt facials.

17:35.800 --> 17:37.300
Let's see...

17:38.100 --> 17:43.300
I can take you 2:30, Tuesday,
April 2nd, in the year 2047.

17:43.600 --> 17:46.200
Great. Could you maybe call me
the day before to remind me?

17:46.500 --> 17:48.200
Yes.

17:48.900 --> 17:50.600
You know, word around the pool

17:50.700 --> 17:53.000
is that you have an appointment
available today.

17:53.300 --> 17:55.600
- It's taken.
- I figured.

17:55.900 --> 17:58.100
I was just taking a walk
and I happened to see your door,

17:58.400 --> 17:59.900
so I thought I'd just...

18:00.200 --> 18:03.500
Hey. I know those daisy shoesies.

18:03.900 --> 18:06.700
- Zelda!
- I'm not Zelda.

18:06.900 --> 18:08.400
You better show your face.

18:09.600 --> 18:11.700
I knew it was you.

18:12.000 --> 18:13.400
I'm so ashamed.

18:13.700 --> 18:15.600
You pretend like
you're going to take a nap,

18:15.700 --> 18:18.000
but all along you were just
going to steal the facial.

18:18.600 --> 18:21.800
- You are so two-faced.
- Me?

18:22.100 --> 18:25.100
You're the one who took a little walk
over here to steal the facial.

18:25.400 --> 18:27.000
Stop ganging up on me.

18:27.200 --> 18:28.500
Then hand me my face.

18:28.800 --> 18:30.200
Gladly.

18:30.300 --> 18:31.900
Catch.

18:34.300 --> 18:36.700
I ruined your facial. Gotta go.

18:38.700 --> 18:39.800
Over here.

18:43.400 --> 18:44.500
Hotter.

18:45.500 --> 18:48.700
Colder. Colder.

18:50.500 --> 18:51.700
I'm free!

18:52.000 --> 18:55.100
Now I can go back
to fighting gingivitis.

18:56.900 --> 18:58.400
- Did you forget something?
- No.

18:58.600 --> 19:03.200
I was just taking a minute
to enjoy my full-size nostrils.

19:04.100 --> 19:06.300
Okay, Amanda, do your stuff.

19:06.600 --> 19:07.900
They were stupid dolls, anyway.

19:08.200 --> 19:10.300
And a lot of them bite.

19:13.600 --> 19:14.700
Finally.

19:14.800 --> 19:16.800
I can stop standing
on my tippy-toes.

19:17.100 --> 19:19.500
- What do you say?
- You'll be back.

19:19.800 --> 19:22.200
I mean, sorry.

19:24.000 --> 19:25.800
Now that we're both out of the box,

19:26.100 --> 19:28.300
I was wondering,
could we go out some time?

19:28.600 --> 19:31.000
Oh, I'd love to,
if I weren't so sick of you.

19:34.700 --> 19:36.900
Okay, Amanda, last one.

19:40.200 --> 19:41.700
There. Happy?

19:43.400 --> 19:45.200
So all that hair is really mine.

19:45.500 --> 19:48.900
Come on, Ralphie,
let's get this linen closet on the road.

19:49.200 --> 19:51.500
Boy, there's a voice
I'm not gonna miss.

19:51.800 --> 19:53.600
- So long, kiddo.
- Ralphie?

19:54.100 --> 19:55.900
You think I can give you
that hug now?

19:56.400 --> 19:57.900
Talk about a broken record.

19:58.200 --> 20:00.100
Well, if it means that much to you.

20:02.300 --> 20:04.100
Okay, I'm done.

20:04.700 --> 20:06.000
Hey, is that a tear in your eye?

20:06.200 --> 20:10.300
No, I'm just remembering that
I have to give up that winter-nap thing.

20:16.400 --> 20:18.400
You know, maybe I shouldn't
babysit anymore.

20:18.700 --> 20:20.100
You think?

20:25.100 --> 20:26.800
Right, I can bend.

20:27.000 --> 20:30.300
Nights like these
make me glad I never had kittens.

20:31.700 --> 20:33.500
- We're home.
- Did you guys have a good time?

20:33.800 --> 20:37.600
- I have no sister.
- No one talk to me.

20:38.000 --> 20:40.800
Aunt Zelda, there's a piece
of your cheek hanging off your face.

20:41.100 --> 20:43.500
That qualifies as talking.

20:44.300 --> 20:46.700
Well, I'm glad you guys
had a good time at the spa.

20:47.100 --> 20:51.200
I'm fine. Amanda's fine.
Oh, she's upstairs asleep.

21:02.300 --> 21:05.200
Here are my hundred "I'm sorry's."

21:06.400 --> 21:07.400
Here are mine.

21:07.700 --> 21:10.000
You'll notice the "sorry's" in bold.

21:11.900 --> 21:13.800
I still think we need
to spend some time apart.

21:14.000 --> 21:17.000
- I agree.
- So I'm going to the Poconos.

21:17.300 --> 21:19.500
Oh, that sounds like fun.

21:19.700 --> 21:21.200
Come on. It's a big place.

21:22.900 --> 21:24.400
You won't even know I'm there.

21:24.600 --> 21:26.300
Sabrina, you'd better do as I say.

21:26.600 --> 21:28.600
I want water. I want water now!

21:28.800 --> 21:30.300
Okay.

21:31.700 --> 21:33.600
Thank you.

21:34.000 --> 21:35.900
I do love a happy ending.
