00:03.503 --> 00:06.003
<i>My name is Sydney Bristow.</i>

00:06.006 --> 00:07.606
<i>Seven years ago,
I was recruited</i>

00:07.607 --> 00:10.576
<i>by a secret branch of the CIA
called SD-6.</i>

00:10.677 --> 00:12.544
<i>I was sworn to secrecy,</i>

00:12.545 --> 00:14.380
<i>but I couldn't keep it
from my fiancé,</i>

00:14.381 --> 00:16.782
<i>and when the head of SD-6
found out,</i>

00:16.783 --> 00:19.283
<i>he had him killed.</i>

00:19.419 --> 00:20.853
<i>That's when I learned
the truth.</i>

00:20.854 --> 00:22.955
<i>SD-6 is not part of the CIA.</i>

00:22.956 --> 00:24.857
<i>I'd been working
for the very people</i>

00:24.858 --> 00:26.759
<i>I thought
I was fighting against.</i>

00:26.760 --> 00:28.127
<i>So I went to the only place</i>

00:28.128 --> 00:30.029
<i>that could help me
take them down.</i>

00:30.030 --> 00:31.764
<i>Now I'm a double agent
for the CIA,</i>

00:31.765 --> 00:35.223
<i>where my handler
is a man named Michael Vaughn.</i>

00:36.569 --> 00:39.004
<i>Only one other person knows
the truth about what I do.</i>

00:39.005 --> 00:41.701
<i>Another double agent
inside SD-6.</i>

00:41.808 --> 00:44.308
<i>Someone I hardly know.</i>

00:44.411 --> 00:46.911
<i>My father.</i>

00:47.580 --> 00:50.174
There's an FBI tribunal
flying in from D.C.

00:50.250 --> 00:52.718
They're gonna question Sydney
about the prophecy

00:52.719 --> 00:54.753
and decide
what the next move is.

00:54.754 --> 00:57.484
- It was just a question.
- It was an accusation.

00:57.557 --> 01:00.526
You are questioning my honor,
my loyalty.

01:00.593 --> 01:02.428
Based on a prophecy
written in a book

01:02.429 --> 01:04.929
that you wouldn't have
if it weren't for me.

01:05.298 --> 01:06.698
Look at this.

01:06.699 --> 01:09.034
"This woman
will have had her effect

01:09.035 --> 01:11.403
never having seen
the beauty of Mt. Subasio. "

01:11.404 --> 01:14.840
According to Rambaldi,
the subject of this prophecy

01:14.941 --> 01:16.909
will have never seen
Mt. Subasio.

01:16.910 --> 01:19.743
Meaning if Sydney were to go
there and see it...

01:19.813 --> 01:22.281
She couldn't be the woman
Rambaldi was talking about.

01:22.282 --> 01:23.782
I thought that made sense.

01:23.783 --> 01:26.283
We'll have to extract her.

01:32.959 --> 01:34.359
The plane is ready
to take you to Italy.

01:34.360 --> 01:35.160
You need to go now.

01:35.161 --> 01:37.362
Dad, I just drove a car
into the ocean.

01:37.363 --> 01:39.923
I knew the police
were waiting for me.

01:39.999 --> 01:41.767
I used the air from the tires.

01:41.768 --> 01:44.965
I was underwater for 10 minutes
before I started to swim.

01:45.071 --> 01:48.666
And as that car
started to fill with water,

01:48.775 --> 01:52.677
I knew what my mother had done
in the same situation.

01:52.745 --> 01:53.745
Sydney.

01:53.746 --> 01:56.246
Mom's alive.

01:57.317 --> 01:59.817
I know it.

02:01.000 --> 02:07.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

03:51.898 --> 03:53.565
Agent King.

03:53.566 --> 03:55.834
- Agent Utley, please.
- Who's speaking?

03:55.835 --> 03:59.771
Tell him it's about a fugitive
the FBI has been looking for.

04:02.909 --> 04:05.409
The fugitive is me.

04:27.267 --> 04:29.895
I don't know how to thank you
for helping me.

04:30.703 --> 04:32.771
Don't thank me.

04:32.772 --> 04:35.764
Devlin said the FBI's focusing
their investigation

04:35.875 --> 04:37.209
where it should have been
all along.

04:37.210 --> 04:39.770
Instead of persecuting you,

04:39.846 --> 04:42.940
they should have been
searching for your mother.

04:43.016 --> 04:45.678
But they were convinced
she was dead.

04:46.452 --> 04:47.619
No.

04:47.620 --> 04:49.187
While you were in Italy,

04:49.188 --> 04:51.657
I did something
I've never done before.

04:51.658 --> 04:53.825
I violated the CIA's trust.

04:53.826 --> 04:56.818
I broke into Langley's
classified archives.

04:56.896 --> 05:00.696
I pulled the operational file
on your mother

05:00.767 --> 05:02.167
to see if I could
find anything

05:02.168 --> 05:05.331
that might prove
your intuition correct.

05:07.440 --> 05:10.409
Apparently, after her accident,

05:10.476 --> 05:12.344
an internal commission
was formed

05:12.345 --> 05:15.781
to assess the damage she'd done
to United States Intelligence.

05:17.817 --> 05:21.548
The commission was comprised
of people I'd worked with,

05:21.621 --> 05:26.058
but one name stood out
in particular.

05:26.125 --> 05:28.625
20 years ago, back at the CIA,

05:28.695 --> 05:31.596
you were on a commission
that investigated Laura's death.

05:33.399 --> 05:34.599
When I heard that,

05:34.600 --> 05:37.626
I couldn't imagine
why you never told me,

05:37.737 --> 05:40.237
unless the commission
discovered something

05:40.306 --> 05:42.806
it didn't want me to know about.

05:44.944 --> 05:49.313
Laura didn't die
in the accident, did she?

05:54.721 --> 05:57.055
Given my state at the time,

05:57.056 --> 05:59.957
they thought it best
that I wasn't told.

06:00.026 --> 06:02.893
They don't know what happened
to her, where she went.

06:02.962 --> 06:06.056
She could still be in this
country, for all they know.

06:08.968 --> 06:11.468
Dad...

06:12.905 --> 06:15.567
I'm gonna find her.
I have to.

06:15.675 --> 06:17.576
Searching for that woman
will accomplish nothing.

06:17.577 --> 06:18.910
No good can come from it.

06:18.911 --> 06:20.846
I need to know where she is.

06:20.847 --> 06:23.475
- We don't know if she's alive.
- I know.

06:23.549 --> 06:25.217
It doesn't change what she did.

06:25.218 --> 06:26.885
Do you expect her
to say "I'm sorry"?

06:26.886 --> 06:28.153
I don't know what to expect.

06:28.154 --> 06:32.284
You better know
exactly what to expect!

06:33.860 --> 06:37.057
What could she ever say
that would satisfy you?

06:47.707 --> 06:52.644
I have this memory
of my father.

06:52.745 --> 06:55.509
I was maybe 5 years old.

06:55.581 --> 06:58.982
We were camping with my mother.

06:59.051 --> 07:01.986
I broke my leg.

07:02.054 --> 07:08.721
And he picked me up and carried
me miles back to the car.

07:08.795 --> 07:10.862
I remember looking up at him

07:10.863 --> 07:15.129
and thinking he was
the strongest man in the world.

07:17.603 --> 07:21.403
Seeing him there in the car
looking so damaged.

07:21.474 --> 07:23.974
I'd never seen him like that.

07:24.410 --> 07:28.506
The idea that I want
to find my mother scares him.

07:31.284 --> 07:34.412
Well, I don't exactly
have a neutral point of view

07:34.487 --> 07:37.422
on the subject of your mother,
but your father's got a point.

07:37.490 --> 07:41.449
And maybe I'm being reckless
or selfish or masochistic.

07:41.527 --> 07:45.520
But if my mother is alive,
then I just have to know that.

07:48.334 --> 07:52.202
Can you help me get everything
the CIA's got on her?

07:52.305 --> 07:54.639
Actually, I can't.

07:54.640 --> 07:58.599
All information concerning her
has been classified by the FBI,

07:58.711 --> 08:00.812
including her connection
to Rambaldi.

08:00.813 --> 08:03.148
Dozens of agents must be
looking for her.

08:03.149 --> 08:06.016
And they're not gonna let me be
part of that operation.

08:06.085 --> 08:07.786
Sydney, I know you need help,

08:07.787 --> 08:10.415
but this time,
I just don't have it to give.

08:12.592 --> 08:15.092
I'm sorry.

08:16.095 --> 08:19.030
Please apologize to
Emily if I woke her.

08:19.098 --> 08:20.966
No, it's all right.

08:20.967 --> 08:22.734
Emily is used to
the phone ringing

08:22.735 --> 08:25.465
in the middle of the night.

08:25.571 --> 08:28.071
You've been avoiding me.

08:29.609 --> 08:34.409
When I found out that
my mother might still be alive,

08:34.480 --> 08:37.278
I just needed some time
to sort it out.

08:37.350 --> 08:39.850
I understand.

08:41.486 --> 08:43.087
And now you want to know

08:43.089 --> 08:46.183
how I could have
hidden the truth from you.

08:46.259 --> 08:47.559
No.

08:47.560 --> 08:50.791
I don't want an explanation.

08:50.863 --> 08:53.696
I came here because I need you
to help me find her.

08:53.766 --> 08:56.266
Mmm.

08:58.037 --> 09:01.632
Sydney.

09:01.741 --> 09:04.142
How much do you remember
about the year

09:04.143 --> 09:06.839
after you were told
that your mother died?

09:08.381 --> 09:12.010
I remember just feeling
disconnected from everything.

09:13.419 --> 09:16.582
My father was away on business
for most of that year.

09:16.656 --> 09:19.156
No.

09:20.626 --> 09:24.585
Your father spent six months
in solitary in a federal prison.

09:24.664 --> 09:28.065
He was suspected of being
in collusion with Laura.

09:28.167 --> 09:30.863
The FBI almost
tried him for treason,

09:30.970 --> 09:34.167
and even though
he was eventually vindicated,

09:34.273 --> 09:39.210
the damage was done,
and he began to unravel.

09:41.180 --> 09:42.647
Unravel.

09:42.648 --> 09:43.748
He drank.

09:43.749 --> 09:46.684
He started taking
unnecessary risks.

09:46.752 --> 09:49.846
You know the father he was
to you all those years.

09:55.995 --> 09:59.692
He took a long time
to fully recover.

09:59.765 --> 10:02.033
I was under direct orders
from the DCI

10:02.034 --> 10:05.026
not to let him know
that Laura had survived.

10:06.505 --> 10:09.838
Unfortunately, that also
required lying to you.

10:10.509 --> 10:15.446
Well, now that I know the truth,

10:15.548 --> 10:17.983
I am removing myself
from active duty

10:17.984 --> 10:19.784
until I find out
what happened to her.

10:19.785 --> 10:23.812
And I am in no position
to allow you to go off

10:23.889 --> 10:26.653
on what appears to be
a rogue operation

10:26.726 --> 10:29.226
that would compromise
the Agency.

10:29.729 --> 10:31.529
Every day you send me out

10:31.530 --> 10:34.158
on operations that
could compromise this agency,

10:34.233 --> 10:37.225
but as long as it's for SD-6,
the risk is acceptable.

10:37.336 --> 10:41.170
It is time that SD-6
took a risk for me.

10:53.452 --> 10:56.046
A daughter has a right
to know her mother.

10:59.525 --> 11:02.025
I'll help you find her.

11:09.802 --> 11:13.135
We are not putting chocolate
chips in the pancakes.

11:13.239 --> 11:15.739
Oh, I got news for you.
Yes, we are.

11:16.776 --> 11:17.776
Hey, guys.

11:17.777 --> 11:20.045
- Hey.
- Oh, you still live here?

11:20.046 --> 11:21.046
I know.

11:21.047 --> 11:23.048
Did that finance seminar
take a week?

11:23.049 --> 11:25.711
If you have any questions
about tax shelters,

11:25.785 --> 11:27.585
I'm your girl.

11:27.586 --> 11:29.187
What are you guys doing?

11:29.188 --> 11:31.589
Francie's gonna take me
to look for a tuxedo.

11:31.590 --> 11:34.821
- Yeah?
- For the awards thing.

11:34.894 --> 11:36.061
Can we come?

11:36.062 --> 11:37.562
Not a chance in hell.

11:37.563 --> 11:39.230
He's too embarrassed.

11:39.231 --> 11:40.632
We're definitely coming.

11:40.633 --> 11:43.227
Oh, my God.
What happened to your arm?

11:43.302 --> 11:45.670
Oh. On the flight back
from Seattle,

11:45.671 --> 11:49.198
this guy hit me with his carryon
pulling it from the overhead.

11:49.308 --> 11:51.509
- Oh.
- Are these chocolate chips?

11:51.510 --> 11:54.010
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

11:54.647 --> 11:57.548
We've identified
Alexander Khasinau

11:57.616 --> 11:58.983
as the person referred to

11:58.984 --> 12:01.885
in underground intelligence
circles as "The Man. "

12:01.954 --> 12:04.821
He controls more assets
than the Russian mafia,

12:04.890 --> 12:07.950
and thanks to
his old Cold War connections,

12:08.027 --> 12:10.894
he has the legitimacy
of a fledgling government.

12:10.963 --> 12:12.397
Hi. Sorry I'm late.

12:12.398 --> 12:14.958
And sorry that I have hives.

12:15.034 --> 12:19.403
And, see, I'm developing
a dermal pigmentation capsule,

12:19.505 --> 12:22.372
and, you know,
not quite right... react.

12:22.441 --> 12:24.776
You know... never mind.

12:24.777 --> 12:27.277
It should be gone
in a couple hours.

12:27.279 --> 12:29.779
Excuse me.

12:32.585 --> 12:35.611
For the last five years,
we've had two deep-cover agents

12:35.688 --> 12:37.689
in the Russian embassy
in Vienna.

12:37.690 --> 12:40.190
One of them is this man.
Kyle Wexler.

12:40.259 --> 12:43.194
We've received a priority-one
communiqué from Wexler

12:43.262 --> 12:45.958
indicating that Khasinau
has just converted

12:46.031 --> 12:48.966
$250 million worth of assets
into cash.

12:49.034 --> 12:51.369
We need to know what
he's spending that money on.

12:51.370 --> 12:53.271
He did manage to include

12:53.272 --> 12:56.241
that he's acquired evidence
of Khasinau's transactions,

12:56.342 --> 12:58.343
which he's encoded
onto a microchip.

12:58.344 --> 13:01.245
He's scheduled a brush pass
Saturday at the embassy.

13:01.313 --> 13:04.282
They're holding their annual
Maslenitsa celebration,

13:04.350 --> 13:06.944
and we've arranged
for you to attend.

13:08.821 --> 13:11.189
I can't focus on active duty...

13:11.190 --> 13:13.658
Khasinau has become
this agency's top priority.

13:13.659 --> 13:15.160
He'll become yours as well.

13:15.161 --> 13:16.861
What I have to do can't wait.

13:16.862 --> 13:18.396
I understand how you feel.

13:18.397 --> 13:20.532
I don't understand what Khasinau
has to do with my mother.

13:20.533 --> 13:23.263
He has everything
to do with your mother.

13:24.403 --> 13:26.903
He was her superior.

13:28.407 --> 13:30.575
When you identified
Khasinau as "The Man,"

13:30.576 --> 13:33.773
I recalled his name from
your mother's investigation.

13:33.846 --> 13:36.247
I thought,
"This has to be a coincidence. "

13:36.248 --> 13:38.416
I did some checking.

13:38.417 --> 13:42.820
He was her superior,
back in his days at the KGB.

13:42.888 --> 13:46.346
This is the only clue
I have to offer you.

13:47.526 --> 13:49.727
Get the microchip.

13:49.728 --> 13:52.063
The more we find out
about Khasinau,

13:52.064 --> 13:54.564
the closer you get
to your mother.

13:58.971 --> 14:01.339
Sydney.

14:01.340 --> 14:03.007
I saw you leave Sloane's office.

14:03.008 --> 14:04.576
I was planning
on telling you.

14:04.577 --> 14:07.637
You've asked Sloane to help you
find your mother.

14:07.713 --> 14:10.273
I thought you'd know
not to ask Sloane for a favor.

14:10.349 --> 14:12.849
You'll spend more time
than you care to paying it back.

14:12.852 --> 14:14.919
What choice do I have?

14:14.920 --> 14:17.021
You can choose not to go.

14:17.022 --> 14:21.254
Dad, Khasinau was
mom's superior.

15:03.135 --> 15:04.836
May I have this dance?

15:04.837 --> 15:07.337
With pleasure.

15:16.248 --> 15:18.049
I'd like to talk to you.

15:19.718 --> 15:21.719
Of course, Jack.
What's on your mind?

15:21.720 --> 15:23.988
Interesting development
about Khasinau.

15:23.989 --> 15:26.057
I see.
So you spoke to Sydney.

15:26.058 --> 15:30.085
You have every right to be
angry, but I was under orders

15:30.162 --> 15:31.996
to keep the findings
confidential.

15:31.997 --> 15:33.164
That I understand.

15:33.165 --> 15:35.400
What I don't understand
is why you agreed

15:35.401 --> 15:38.063
to help Sydney find her mother
without consulting me.

15:38.170 --> 15:42.038
She was gonna pursue this
with or without our blessing.

15:42.107 --> 15:44.475
She'll only find disappointment.

15:44.476 --> 15:46.644
That depends
on what she's expecting.

15:46.645 --> 15:49.273
You are different people, Jack.

15:52.551 --> 15:55.315
Are you sure this isn't
affecting you?

15:55.387 --> 15:57.887
I assure you,
my concern is only for Sydney.

15:57.957 --> 15:59.390
Yeah.

15:59.391 --> 16:02.690
Your assurances notwithstanding,
I think it would be best

16:02.761 --> 16:04.729
if you took a break
from active duty.

16:04.730 --> 16:08.689
Just, what, a few days
to clear your head.

16:08.767 --> 16:13.431
I wouldn't feel comfortable
leaving Sydney alone right now.

16:13.539 --> 16:16.906
If she were your daughter,
I'm sure you'd understand.

16:19.345 --> 16:20.678
You should know by now

16:20.679 --> 16:24.479
that my interest
is in protecting Sydney.

16:24.550 --> 16:27.110
It's always been my pleasure
to fill in for you

16:27.186 --> 16:29.686
when you were indisposed.

16:40.032 --> 16:42.100
- You ready?
- Ready.

16:42.101 --> 16:45.002
These earrings are
gonna make you look radiant,

16:45.104 --> 16:47.105
and I mean that literally,

16:47.106 --> 16:50.303
because
once you activate them,

16:50.376 --> 16:53.607
they will emit a infrared pulse
invisible to the naked eye.

16:53.679 --> 16:56.341
Thanks to our
high-visibility brush passes,

16:56.415 --> 16:58.149
the agent you're meeting

16:58.150 --> 17:00.151
will know to wear
I.R. -capable contacts,

17:00.152 --> 17:03.588
and that's how he'll I.D. You.

17:20.839 --> 17:22.673
Excuse me.
May I cut in?

17:22.674 --> 17:23.674
Of course.

17:23.675 --> 17:26.109
But I should warn you
she likes to lead.

17:26.111 --> 17:28.671
That's good.
Maybe I'll learn something new.

17:35.521 --> 17:37.088
Listen to me carefully.

17:37.089 --> 17:39.683
Wexler's dead.
We can't stay here.

17:39.758 --> 17:42.093
It's a matter of time
before my cover's blown.

17:42.094 --> 17:43.861
- Who are you?
- Wexler's partner.

17:43.862 --> 17:46.456
That's my ring
you feel on your neck.

17:46.532 --> 17:49.467
It's a jet injector
for a neutrotoxin.

17:49.535 --> 17:51.569
I can give you
the old bona fides.

17:51.570 --> 17:53.404
How do I know this isn't
a setup?

17:53.405 --> 17:56.465
Credit Dauphine
is SD-6's front company.

17:56.575 --> 17:58.910
Marshall runs
the op-tech division,

17:58.911 --> 18:01.903
and Sloane is a humorless
son of a bitch.

18:05.117 --> 18:07.617
Dixon, change of plans.
Wexler's dead.

18:07.686 --> 18:10.280
He may have talked.
I'm going for the microchip.

18:10.355 --> 18:13.119
Copy that. I'll have the car
brought around front.

18:13.192 --> 18:15.193
Is that ring you're wearing
Marshall's?

18:15.194 --> 18:17.295
I was bluffing. Were you
recruited out of college?

18:17.296 --> 18:18.796
- Yes.
- Which?

18:18.797 --> 18:21.297
Berkeley.

18:25.404 --> 18:27.305
Oh, my God.

18:27.306 --> 18:28.606
Oh, my God.

18:35.214 --> 18:37.714
This is a restricted area.

18:39.118 --> 18:41.618
Hey.

18:48.994 --> 18:51.494
How you been?

18:59.371 --> 19:01.439
I can't believe it's you.

19:01.440 --> 19:02.507
Yeah.

19:02.508 --> 19:03.875
What are we doing here?

19:03.876 --> 19:06.606
Wexler was undercover
when he was compromised.

19:06.678 --> 19:08.746
The ambassador's
on Khasinau's payroll.

19:08.747 --> 19:11.015
So is embassy security.

19:11.016 --> 19:13.516
Khasinau ships everything
through the embassy

19:13.519 --> 19:16.181
so he doesn't have to deal
with custom inspections.

19:23.562 --> 19:24.729
God, it's Wexler.

19:24.730 --> 19:27.165
The ambassador did not
know he had the chip.

19:27.166 --> 19:28.466
He stashed it someplace.

19:28.467 --> 19:29.600
Or he swallowed it.

19:29.601 --> 19:32.101
Yeah.

19:44.116 --> 19:46.616
Okay, what...

19:58.630 --> 20:00.998
Sydney, abort.
They knew we were coming.

20:00.999 --> 20:03.201
They'll be looking for you.

20:03.202 --> 20:06.035
We need another minute.
We almost have the microchip.

20:13.645 --> 20:15.580
Aw, damn it,
his stomach's empty.

20:15.581 --> 20:18.081
It could be lodged
in his esophagus.

20:20.719 --> 20:23.219
You want to give me
a hand here and spread?

20:24.923 --> 20:27.391
- Little bit wider.
- Okay.

20:27.392 --> 20:29.026
So, you been good, generally?

20:29.027 --> 20:31.229
- Yeah, you know work.
- Yeah.

20:31.230 --> 20:33.730
There it is.
You see it?

20:33.765 --> 20:36.265
Got it.

20:59.725 --> 21:02.225
Whoa!
Get in.

21:02.361 --> 21:04.095
I'm not gonna ask.

21:04.096 --> 21:05.529
Dixon.

21:05.530 --> 21:06.597
Noah?

21:06.598 --> 21:09.098
Let's go, let's go.

21:17.542 --> 21:20.204
I'm not real anxious
to see Sloane's face

21:20.279 --> 21:24.238
when he hears
we had to pull Noah out.

21:24.316 --> 21:26.816
What choice did we have?

21:27.619 --> 21:30.816
Do me a favor, Syd.
Tread carefully here.

21:30.889 --> 21:33.687
Until he's debriefed,
I wouldn't get too friendly.

21:33.759 --> 21:36.259
It's ancient history.
It was five years ago.

21:37.095 --> 21:39.196
Does anybody have change
for 100 rubles?

21:39.197 --> 21:42.257
A lady back in coach
is about to kill me.

21:42.334 --> 21:43.901
I was gonna stretch my legs.

21:43.902 --> 21:45.269
- Really?
- Yeah.

21:45.270 --> 21:47.770
Thanks.

21:48.073 --> 21:50.573
No problem.

21:51.743 --> 21:53.444
Hi.

21:53.445 --> 21:55.945
Hi.

22:05.057 --> 22:07.557
I should get some sleep.

22:08.627 --> 22:11.994
Syd, if you're mad,
that's fine.

22:12.064 --> 22:15.124
I understand. You don't
want to talk, it's okay.

22:15.233 --> 22:16.967
You don't have to be polite.

22:16.968 --> 22:19.170
I want you to know
I'm not mad anymore,

22:19.171 --> 22:21.005
and I don't think
you should be.

22:21.006 --> 22:22.673
- You're not mad?
- Mnh-mnh.

22:22.674 --> 22:24.508
What do you have
to be mad about?

22:24.509 --> 22:27.342
I understand it must have been
hard for you when I left,

22:27.412 --> 22:29.113
but you didn't put up a fight.

22:29.114 --> 22:31.248
What kind of fight
was I supposed to put up?

22:31.249 --> 22:33.217
I waited for six hours for you.

22:33.218 --> 22:35.846
- You didn't even call.
- I didn't know you were leaving.

22:35.921 --> 22:38.421
Sloane told me you had been
transferred abroad.

22:38.490 --> 22:39.857
I wrote you.
I wrote.

22:39.858 --> 22:41.192
What?

22:41.193 --> 22:44.219
I told you
to meet me in San Pedro.

22:44.296 --> 22:45.696
I never got a letter.

22:45.697 --> 22:48.996
I didn't send you a letter.

22:49.067 --> 22:51.235
I encoded a message
in a junk e-mail.

22:51.236 --> 22:54.034
You should have been able to
pick it up from the subject.

22:57.342 --> 23:01.335
I always set my computer
to filter out junk E-mail.

23:16.628 --> 23:19.222
This constitutes
a major setback.

23:19.297 --> 23:20.965
By extracting Agent Hicks,

23:20.966 --> 23:23.491
you've squandered a 5-year
investment.

23:23.568 --> 23:25.836
Come on, Sloane.
It's not her fault.

23:25.837 --> 23:27.605
Your investment was burned.

23:27.606 --> 23:29.006
If they didn't get me out,

23:29.007 --> 23:31.308
the exact same thing
would have happened to me.

23:31.309 --> 23:33.778
The fact that we even
got the microchip

23:33.779 --> 23:35.112
means he didn't die in vain.

23:35.113 --> 23:36.514
I'll listen to your report

23:36.515 --> 23:39.450
after you've been evaluated
by Security Section.

23:40.318 --> 23:44.186
Dixon, would you escort
Agent Hicks to McCullough?

23:49.127 --> 23:52.290
Now, I have done you
a favor, Sydney.

23:52.364 --> 23:55.060
So should the need
ever arise...

23:56.835 --> 23:59.963
I'm sure that I can count
on you to return it.

24:02.240 --> 24:04.740
In '97, I was admitted
as a graduate student

24:04.776 --> 24:07.609
to the Moscow Institute
for International Relations.

24:07.679 --> 24:10.375
Worked as a courier for
the Russian embassy in Baghdad,

24:10.449 --> 24:13.577
was on the visa desk
at the consulate in Cape Town.

24:13.652 --> 24:14.985
In November of 2001,

24:14.986 --> 24:17.853
I was put on as an attaché
at the Viennese embassy

24:17.923 --> 24:19.356
and given a low-level clearance.

24:19.357 --> 24:21.058
While you were under alias

24:21.059 --> 24:24.222
as a member of the Russian
Diplomatic Corps,

24:24.296 --> 24:27.732
were you approached by any other
agency for recruitment?

24:27.799 --> 24:28.799
Yes.

24:28.800 --> 24:30.267
Which agency?

24:30.268 --> 24:31.502
K- Directorate.

24:31.503 --> 24:33.370
Did you accept their offer?

24:33.371 --> 24:34.605
Yes, I did.

24:34.606 --> 24:37.700
They're listening
to this conversation right now.

24:40.479 --> 24:43.414
Please answer the question
truthfully.

24:43.482 --> 24:44.682
Of course not.

24:44.683 --> 24:46.217
Why did you volunteer

24:46.218 --> 24:49.619
for prolonged undercover
assignment to begin with?

24:49.688 --> 24:52.282
I fail to see
how my motives are relevant.

24:52.357 --> 24:54.024
My reasons are my own.

24:54.025 --> 24:57.756
Unfortunately, Agent Hicks,
they are not.

25:03.735 --> 25:06.235
Okay, um...

25:06.338 --> 25:08.838
Because I was in love.

25:09.441 --> 25:11.509
And I was afraid
to admit that to myself.

25:11.510 --> 25:14.343
I saw that as being a sign
of weakness in this work.

25:14.412 --> 25:16.912
So I left.

25:19.117 --> 25:23.053
The only reason that I am able
to speak about that now

25:23.121 --> 25:25.817
is that I've had five years
to regret my mistake.

25:25.891 --> 25:27.725
May I have the name
of the person

25:27.726 --> 25:30.226
to whom you are referring?

25:30.228 --> 25:32.728
Absolutely not.

25:33.965 --> 25:37.298
You are aware that I have
the authority to take steps

25:37.369 --> 25:41.135
that will compel you to answer.

25:41.239 --> 25:43.140
Yes, I am,
and I am also aware

25:43.141 --> 25:46.542
that the only other agent
anywhere near Khasinau is dead,

25:46.611 --> 25:49.046
which makes me somewhat
of a valued commodity.

25:49.047 --> 25:50.981
I suggest
we keep the questions

25:50.982 --> 25:55.009
limited to subjects that SD-6
really needs to know about.

25:56.621 --> 26:00.182
Besides, where I come from, a
gentleman doesn't kiss and tell.

26:07.599 --> 26:10.466
Our station chief in Vienna
got your dead drop.

26:10.535 --> 26:13.129
I'm sorry you had
a rough time at the embassy.

26:13.238 --> 26:15.673
If anything turns up
on the microchip,

26:15.674 --> 26:18.042
I'll let you know.

26:18.043 --> 26:20.311
The agent you extracted.
Noah Hicks.

26:20.312 --> 26:23.748
You mentioned him in the initial
background report you wrote

26:23.815 --> 26:25.883
when you first made contact
with the CIA.

26:25.884 --> 26:28.384
We met when I was a trainee.

26:31.389 --> 26:33.791
We actually dated for a while.

26:33.792 --> 26:35.092
Really.

26:35.093 --> 26:36.727
We kept it under the radar.

26:36.728 --> 26:39.925
SD-6 discourages
fraternization among agents.

26:41.333 --> 26:43.833
So does the CIA.

26:45.804 --> 26:47.504
There's one more thing.

26:47.505 --> 26:49.840
Do you know where
your father's been lately?

26:49.841 --> 26:51.508
I talked to him
an hour ago. Why?

26:51.509 --> 26:53.844
Kretchmer's left
two call signals for a meet,

26:53.845 --> 26:56.345
but we haven't received
confirmation yet.

27:08.226 --> 27:10.726
Club soda, please.

27:14.566 --> 27:16.400
How'd you find me?

27:16.401 --> 27:18.636
Your car was still parked
in your garage.

27:18.637 --> 27:21.137
I thought you might've walked
somewhere close.

27:23.108 --> 27:25.770
It's the fifth place I looked.

27:25.844 --> 27:28.938
- Mike, can I get the check?
- Yeah, sure.

27:36.021 --> 27:37.955
Dad, it's 2:00 in the afternoon.

27:37.956 --> 27:40.456
What are you doing here?

27:43.662 --> 27:46.162
I think you might want
to talk to someone.

27:47.465 --> 27:49.965
Noted.

27:51.803 --> 27:54.738
Six months ago, I wasn't...

27:54.806 --> 27:58.674
I didn't even know
how to talk to you.

27:58.743 --> 28:00.611
But now I feel like...

28:00.612 --> 28:03.376
At least I feel like
I can come to you and say...

28:03.448 --> 28:07.441
What's happening between us,
Sydney, is temporary.

28:08.520 --> 28:11.148
I'm not suggesting the person
you talk to should be me.

28:11.222 --> 28:12.656
It shouldn't be.

28:12.657 --> 28:16.286
But the CIA has counselors.

28:17.862 --> 28:19.363
You should see one of them.

28:19.364 --> 28:22.629
Sydney, you are responsible
for no one but yourself.

28:22.701 --> 28:25.226
It's not irrational for me
to be worried about you!

28:25.336 --> 28:28.965
Please keep your voice down.

28:40.018 --> 28:42.714
I didn't think you'd listen
to my advice.

28:46.157 --> 28:48.657
So I made it official.

28:52.263 --> 28:55.494
I came here to pass along
an order from Devlin.

28:56.668 --> 29:00.297
You're going to see a counselor
for trauma evaluation.

29:16.321 --> 29:18.222
Hey, Syd.

29:18.223 --> 29:21.386
I'm sorry you had to come down.
It's my fault.

29:21.459 --> 29:25.054
Really. We're uploading
the microchip.

29:25.130 --> 29:28.429
There's 10,000 files.
14 different languages.

29:28.500 --> 29:31.560
Linguistics needs all the help
they can get.

29:33.004 --> 29:35.139
- So you're cleared.
- Yeah.

29:35.140 --> 29:37.207
You survived the debriefing.

29:37.208 --> 29:38.442
Yes, I did.

29:38.443 --> 29:42.243
You know, and I forgot
how much I missed McCullough.

29:45.383 --> 29:47.151
Let's get started.

29:47.152 --> 29:54.115
<i># Walk inside #</i>

29:54.192 --> 29:59.186
<i># Gets noticed #</i>

30:02.534 --> 30:09.372
<i># Fears conspire #</i>

30:09.440 --> 30:14.503
<i># They won't go away #</i>

30:16.548 --> 30:21.451
<i># And I know #</i>

30:21.519 --> 30:23.854
So, how long are you planning
on staying?

30:23.855 --> 30:28.189
I'm not exactly sure.
It's somewhat complicated.

30:29.394 --> 30:30.394
Why?

30:30.395 --> 30:32.895
Long story.

30:38.002 --> 30:41.995
I remember when you had just
got back from endurance training

30:42.106 --> 30:44.606
before you were sent out
as a field op,

30:44.609 --> 30:47.908
and you came back, and you had
this incredible glow.

30:47.979 --> 30:50.504
And I remember...
Yeah, you did.

30:50.582 --> 30:54.848
I remember thinking, "Man,
this girl's really having fun. "

30:56.588 --> 30:58.689
I remember being worried
about that

30:58.690 --> 31:01.955
because I knew one day
you would not feel that way.

31:04.863 --> 31:06.029
That you were not aware

31:06.030 --> 31:08.332
of what you were getting
yourself into.

31:08.333 --> 31:10.833
You thought
I'd get myself killed.

31:10.935 --> 31:13.303
Maybe.

31:13.304 --> 31:15.405
Is that why you left?

31:15.406 --> 31:18.170
No.

31:18.243 --> 31:20.743
No.

31:21.679 --> 31:25.115
Well, you were right
about one thing.

31:25.183 --> 31:27.683
I'm not having fun anymore.

31:32.991 --> 31:34.324
We're gonna be late.

31:34.325 --> 31:35.859
I can't find my jacket.

31:35.860 --> 31:37.294
I don't want
to miss the previews.

31:37.295 --> 31:39.991
All right, I'm just going
to borrow one of Syd's.

31:40.064 --> 31:41.899
Do you think
I bought the right tux?

31:41.900 --> 31:44.400
Yeah, for the amount of money
you wanted to spend.

31:44.435 --> 31:46.637
What's that supposed to mean?

31:46.638 --> 31:48.038
What?

31:48.039 --> 31:50.007
Didn't Syd say she went
to Seattle?

31:50.008 --> 31:51.475
Yeah. So?

31:51.476 --> 31:54.912
Why is there a return ticket
from Italy in her pocket?

31:55.013 --> 31:56.647
It's probably from another trip.

31:56.648 --> 31:59.148
It's dated last week.

32:01.119 --> 32:04.418
Why wouldn't she tell us
about a trip to Italy?

32:12.063 --> 32:14.691
What you are looking at
is the schematic

32:14.766 --> 32:17.530
of a Westbury 23
supercomputer.

32:17.602 --> 32:21.402
It's capable of making 500
trillion calculations per sec.

32:21.506 --> 32:23.407
Khasinau bought two of them.

32:23.408 --> 32:25.442
What for?

32:25.443 --> 32:27.811
These computers are ideal
for simulating

32:27.812 --> 32:30.474
theoretical engineering designs.

32:30.548 --> 32:34.348
If Khasinau has acquired
enough Rambaldi artifacts,

32:34.419 --> 32:37.149
he may be able to assemble
these artifacts correctly

32:37.221 --> 32:39.721
and extrapolate
what missing pieces remain

32:39.791 --> 32:41.792
from the overall design.

32:41.793 --> 32:44.293
And that's why you need
to steal the data core.

32:44.362 --> 32:45.762
How are you?

32:45.763 --> 32:47.631
Um... May I?

32:47.632 --> 32:49.032
- Sure.
- Thank you.

32:49.033 --> 32:51.533
Thanks to the microchip,
we have an image

32:51.569 --> 32:54.069
of the data core,
and, trust me, this core...

32:54.072 --> 32:55.539
hard-core.

32:55.540 --> 32:57.474
It's a photorefractive
crystal cube.

32:57.475 --> 32:58.742
It acts like a sponge.

32:58.743 --> 33:00.077
This has got enough capacity

33:00.078 --> 33:02.379
to serve as a backup archive
for both computers,

33:02.380 --> 33:05.281
but the problem is that in order
for this little puppy to work,

33:05.350 --> 33:08.478
it's gotta be kept in a chamber
halfway to absolute zero.

33:08.553 --> 33:09.987
It is cold enough

33:09.988 --> 33:12.456
to freeze your skin to stone
in under a minute.

33:12.457 --> 33:14.558
Even if a millimeter
of it is exposed.

33:14.559 --> 33:15.892
In addition,

33:15.893 --> 33:18.128
Khasinau's computer
complex in Arkhangelsk

33:18.129 --> 33:19.329
is a mile underground.

33:19.330 --> 33:21.855
The surrounding forests
are patrolled

33:21.933 --> 33:23.700
by private security forces.

33:23.701 --> 33:25.302
I would like
to point out that,

33:25.303 --> 33:27.803
given this high level
of security,

33:27.905 --> 33:30.207
it is likely
that Khasinau is using it

33:30.208 --> 33:32.376
as his primary archive.

33:32.377 --> 33:35.505
Account numbers, old contacts,

33:35.580 --> 33:38.549
every agent
who's ever worked for him.

33:38.616 --> 33:40.917
This is a 2-person operation.

33:40.918 --> 33:44.046
You've been on assignment
a long time. I'll go.

33:44.122 --> 33:45.989
I know the area pretty well.

33:45.990 --> 33:48.225
I did a lot of recon there.

33:48.226 --> 33:49.659
Well, Noah's right.

33:49.660 --> 33:52.686
We need every advantage
on this one.

33:52.764 --> 33:55.264
You leave in an hour.

34:05.343 --> 34:07.310
- My feet hurt!
- Yep.

34:07.311 --> 34:09.079
- Can we stop?
- Nope.

34:09.080 --> 34:11.114
I gotta take my boots off.

34:11.114 --> 34:13.250
You take 'em off,
your foot will swell up.

34:13.251 --> 34:15.418
Hey, hey, hey!

34:15.420 --> 34:17.788
We're Americans!
We're Americans!

34:17.789 --> 34:20.289
- Okay. Whoa!
- We're Americans!

34:23.995 --> 34:26.396
You were speculating
that perhaps Sydney's desire

34:26.397 --> 34:28.864
to find her mother
could be interpreted

34:28.866 --> 34:30.900
as criticism of you as a father.

34:30.902 --> 34:33.402
I suppose it's understandable.

34:33.438 --> 34:37.204
Much like a normal family
after a divorce,

34:37.275 --> 34:38.775
when parental jealousy

34:38.775 --> 34:41.110
is stirred
over a child's affection.

34:41.112 --> 34:43.842
And how would you define
a "normal" family?

34:45.315 --> 34:48.978
I suppose it's one in which
the family members

34:49.053 --> 34:52.284
aren't under orders to lie
to each other.

34:52.356 --> 34:54.424
I see what you're getting at.

34:54.425 --> 34:59.362
Maybe there's no such thing
as a "normal" family.

35:01.466 --> 35:03.934
Well, okay, Mr. Bristow.

35:03.935 --> 35:05.635
I guess we can call it a day.

35:05.636 --> 35:08.136
I prefer Jack.

35:10.475 --> 35:13.035
One more thing, Jack.

35:13.144 --> 35:17.080
I don't believe a word you've
said to me over this past hour.

35:18.249 --> 35:19.816
Don't get me wrong.

35:19.817 --> 35:22.252
I think you're a master.

35:22.253 --> 35:25.950
You have all your subconscious
tells under control.

35:26.023 --> 35:28.685
You're smart enough
to struggle with words,

35:28.759 --> 35:31.421
but I think you told me
what I wanted to hear

35:31.496 --> 35:34.693
so you could get out of my
office as quickly as possible.

35:34.765 --> 35:40.226
I also think that someone
so skilled at deception

35:40.304 --> 35:43.398
is in danger
of deceiving himself.

35:45.076 --> 35:48.239
I am going to recommend
that you see me once a week.

35:49.514 --> 35:51.715
You haven't got a clue

35:51.716 --> 35:55.948
what's required to lead
the kind of life I lead,

35:56.020 --> 35:58.921
to maintain a balance
between two lives

35:58.990 --> 36:01.458
and protect my daughter
in the process.

36:01.459 --> 36:03.793
The kind of person
who does that,

36:03.794 --> 36:08.993
the kind of person I have to be,
is not the kind of person

36:09.066 --> 36:11.566
who would come in here
and talk to you.

36:12.737 --> 36:15.934
Well, then, I guess
we're making some progress.

36:18.009 --> 36:20.842
See you next week.

36:35.326 --> 36:38.386
Is there any chance we can
contact the American embassy?

36:42.833 --> 36:45.001
What were you taking
pictures of?

36:45.002 --> 36:47.502
Just the scenery, I swear.

36:47.538 --> 36:50.996
Why don't you just take the film
and give her back the camera?

36:51.108 --> 36:53.608
It was just the scenery.

37:01.519 --> 37:04.019
Keys. Hey.

37:05.723 --> 37:08.223
Let's go.

37:09.994 --> 37:12.494
Come on.

37:21.072 --> 37:23.572
Move, move, move.

37:36.654 --> 37:38.154
Let's go, Syd.

37:38.155 --> 37:40.655
I'm disengaging the core.

38:09.353 --> 38:11.853
I'm in.

38:14.358 --> 38:17.088
Don't forget to keep that
core temperature constant.

38:17.161 --> 38:20.358
You must keep
the core temperature constant.

38:20.431 --> 38:22.931
Got it.

38:26.771 --> 38:27.937
How we doing?

38:27.938 --> 38:31.203
Almost there.

38:34.979 --> 38:37.479
Got it.

39:04.141 --> 39:05.275
Noah, I'm freezing.

39:05.276 --> 39:08.074
Syd, hang on.
The system is in lockdown.

39:46.384 --> 39:48.818
Come on, wake up.
Wake up.

39:48.819 --> 39:51.319
Syd, wake up.
Come on.

39:58.262 --> 40:00.563
Good girl, come on.
Good. Come on.

40:00.564 --> 40:02.599
Up, up, up.

40:02.600 --> 40:05.100
Up, up, up, up.

40:13.677 --> 40:15.545
Come on, move.
Syd, come on, baby.

40:15.546 --> 40:18.046
Move, move, move.

40:22.420 --> 40:24.920
It's just weird.
I don't know. Italy.

40:24.955 --> 40:28.015
What if she met somebody
on one of her business trips?

40:28.092 --> 40:29.793
Why would she keep that secret?

40:29.794 --> 40:33.127
Maybe she doesn't want to talk
about it, or she's embarrassed.

40:33.197 --> 40:35.598
Oh, come on, why?

40:35.599 --> 40:37.534
What?

40:37.535 --> 40:40.035
The bruise.
What if he's beating her?

40:40.137 --> 40:43.595
Are you kidding? Sydney would
never put up with that.

40:45.409 --> 40:47.909
Maybe she's sleeping
with her boss.

40:48.779 --> 40:50.680
Sloane? No.

40:50.681 --> 40:51.681
No.

40:51.682 --> 40:54.182
Should we forget
we even found the ticket?

40:54.185 --> 40:55.685
You think she's in trouble.

40:55.686 --> 40:58.780
When she gets back from...
Where did she say she went?

40:58.856 --> 41:00.356
San Francisco.

41:00.357 --> 41:01.724
Which I'm sure she did.

41:01.725 --> 41:03.793
I think we're just blowing this
out of proportion.

41:03.794 --> 41:05.261
There's an explanation.

41:05.262 --> 41:09.289
We'll ask her when she gets
back from San Francisco.

41:17.041 --> 41:18.374
Did you get through?

41:18.375 --> 41:19.542
Yeah.

41:19.543 --> 41:22.011
It was almost impossible
to get a signal,

41:22.012 --> 41:24.845
but we got an extraction set
at 0800.

41:25.749 --> 41:27.250
That's six hours.

41:27.251 --> 41:29.751
Yeah.

41:31.188 --> 41:34.521
We should prepare in case
Khasinau's men show up.

41:34.592 --> 41:37.060
The floorboards in
the corner over there lift up.

41:37.061 --> 41:39.561
This safe house has saved me
a couple of times.

41:42.766 --> 41:46.327
What would be great right now
is a fire in that fireplace.

41:55.813 --> 41:57.814
I heard a chopper making rounds.

41:57.815 --> 42:00.682
If it's thermal-equipped,
it'll pick up the heat.

42:04.655 --> 42:07.647
What were you looking for
in that database, anyway?

42:09.727 --> 42:12.195
It's a long story.

42:12.196 --> 42:16.690
Well, we've got six hours,
so that's good.

42:18.602 --> 42:21.264
I was looking for information
about my mother.

42:21.372 --> 42:23.039
Your mother.

42:23.040 --> 42:25.540
A lot's happened since you left.

42:27.278 --> 42:29.379
And I want to fill you in,

42:29.380 --> 42:33.840
but I don't know if I feel
comfortable doing that yet.

42:33.918 --> 42:35.518
Right.

42:35.519 --> 42:38.215
You're still mad.

42:38.289 --> 42:40.917
No.

42:40.991 --> 42:43.026
<i># Feel the fever coming #</i>

42:43.027 --> 42:45.361
<i># You're shaking
and twitching #</i>

42:45.362 --> 42:46.930
<i># You can scratch all over #</i>

42:46.931 --> 42:49.900
<i># But that won't stop
you itching #</i>

42:52.836 --> 42:57.933
When you left
and you just disappeared...

42:59.777 --> 43:02.507
It was a kick in the stomach.

43:04.548 --> 43:08.541
And I carried that around
for a long time.

43:13.023 --> 43:17.050
You were the last person that
I ever wanted to see again.

43:17.127 --> 43:19.062
Ever.

43:19.063 --> 43:23.363
And you were the only person
that I ever wanted to see again.

43:26.870 --> 43:29.370
<i># Can you feel #</i>

43:29.440 --> 43:32.807

43:47.424 --> 43:49.025
Wait.
