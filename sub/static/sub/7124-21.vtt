00:29.488 --> 00:30.761
Blegh!

00:30.838 --> 00:33.188
Your tooth looks bad, dude!

00:33.265 --> 00:35.804
Smells like a garden shed in here.

00:37.404 --> 00:40.010
Finn, I think
you have to go dentist.

00:40.087 --> 00:41.536
I can't go dentist, Jake!

00:41.613 --> 00:45.949
- You got to take care of it!
- Just go dentist, dude.

00:46.026 --> 00:47.300
Okay.

00:47.489 --> 00:51.377
- Easy does it.
- Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

00:51.454 --> 00:55.318
- Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
- Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

00:56.923 --> 00:58.481
This is so bad.

00:58.558 --> 01:01.219
What did Princess Bubblegum
say when you showed her?

01:01.378 --> 01:04.425
- Ahhhhh!
- Hmm...

01:04.619 --> 01:08.886
Finn, this is literally serious.
You have to go dentist.

01:08.963 --> 01:11.133
Noooooooooo!

01:11.258 --> 01:14.759
Dude! You! Got! To! Go! Dentist!

01:14.836 --> 01:17.040
- Blegh!
- Noooo!

01:17.117 --> 01:19.987
I'm too strong for the world!

01:22.735 --> 01:24.486
I don't want
to go dentist, Jake.

01:24.563 --> 01:27.315
They put you in a hole filled
with snakes and rotten butter,

01:27.392 --> 01:28.645
and they leave you there.

01:28.722 --> 01:30.950
Come on, man.
It's not that bad.

01:31.307 --> 01:32.557
Okay.

01:32.677 --> 01:35.181
Aaah! Aah! Aah! Aaaaah!

01:35.258 --> 01:36.547
Right?

01:38.157 --> 01:39.300
Wuh!

01:39.422 --> 01:43.553
N-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o! Unh!

01:44.516 --> 01:48.034
This isn't so bad. My sword!

01:48.111 --> 01:50.846
Wonder where... aah!

01:58.544 --> 02:00.076
Soft sand.

02:00.610 --> 02:01.757
Ant.

02:01.877 --> 02:05.518
Welcome to dentist, Cadet!
I'm Leftenant Gamergate!

02:06.145 --> 02:07.901
Snakes and rotten butter...

02:07.978 --> 02:09.066
a common mistake.

02:09.143 --> 02:12.708
You were expected to arrive
with snacks and a flashlight.

02:12.785 --> 02:14.382
Either way, you're here.

02:14.607 --> 02:16.898
So... dentist is ants?

02:16.975 --> 02:18.619
Dentist is dentist, Cadet!

02:18.696 --> 02:19.907
Drop and give me 20!

02:19.984 --> 02:21.169
I don't have any money.

02:21.246 --> 02:23.036
Funny man goes dentist, huh?

02:23.113 --> 02:25.998
The queen's office is in the royal hill.

02:28.216 --> 02:29.432
Holes...

02:33.115 --> 02:36.002
- Hmm.
- Listen, I wasn't here when you came in.

02:36.079 --> 02:38.496
I'm a very busy woman.

02:40.017 --> 02:42.120
Hello.
My name is General Tarsal.

02:42.197 --> 02:46.362
I am the current queen of this regiment,
and please have a seat.

02:48.454 --> 02:50.044
As a first-time recruit,

02:50.121 --> 02:54.040
I'm confident that you have
no idea what you're doing here.

02:54.117 --> 02:55.380
My tooth hurts.

02:55.457 --> 02:57.600
Let's take a look at your file.

02:57.892 --> 02:59.815
Ah, you're a fighter.

02:59.892 --> 03:02.658
- Yeah, we can use a fighter.
- My tooth hurts.

03:02.735 --> 03:05.136
What? Of course it does.

03:05.213 --> 03:06.741
Let me explain.

03:06.818 --> 03:09.319
You have gone dentist.

03:09.396 --> 03:13.124
That means that you will
serve a brief tour of duty,

03:13.201 --> 03:16.519
and in exchange, we will provide
full dental rehabilitation!

03:16.596 --> 03:19.079
You will be on the front,
fighting monsters...

03:19.156 --> 03:23.240
monstrous monster worms!

03:23.317 --> 03:24.321
Worms.

03:24.441 --> 03:27.396
The worms are employed by... the flies.

03:27.473 --> 03:28.544
Worms.

03:28.621 --> 03:30.814
Work for the flies.
You fight them,

03:30.891 --> 03:32.809
- we'll fix your teeth.
- Me.

03:32.886 --> 03:34.135
Yes, you!

03:34.214 --> 03:38.448
Your mission is to secure
this junction at all costs.

03:39.126 --> 03:40.701
Upon completion of service,

03:40.778 --> 03:43.459
you will be sworn to
absolute secrecy.

03:43.536 --> 03:45.765
The flies have
spies everywhere.

03:45.842 --> 03:48.751
- Fly spies!
- Heh heh.

03:49.440 --> 03:53.154
These worms are no joke,
so you'll be assigned a partner.

03:53.231 --> 03:55.599
Uh, let's see. Cadet...

03:55.676 --> 03:58.530
- Tiffany Oiler.
- Tiffany?!

03:58.660 --> 04:02.334
Tiffany!
Finn, I'm gonna kill you!

04:02.411 --> 04:04.253
That guy wants to kill me!

04:04.353 --> 04:06.424
Tough nuts.
That's dentist.

04:06.501 --> 04:09.575
Cadets, dinner is being
served in the mess hall,

04:09.652 --> 04:11.860
central hill, sub-tunnel 8!

04:13.409 --> 04:15.795
Hm. Do you have anything less sugary?

04:20.195 --> 04:21.264
Yo, Finn!

04:21.500 --> 04:24.097
I'm gonna kill you!

04:24.174 --> 04:25.842
Doing it for my tooth.

04:28.766 --> 04:29.996
Ruff!

04:30.125 --> 04:31.466
Thought so.

04:32.900 --> 04:35.218
Hey, uh... partner...

04:35.910 --> 04:38.470
Um,
so how're you doin', Tiffany?

04:38.547 --> 04:41.299
Yeah, I lost my teeth
eatin' the baker's shard.

04:41.376 --> 04:43.039
It's a lot of sugar, right?

04:43.116 --> 04:45.530
Oh. Did you already
know what dentist is?

04:45.607 --> 04:48.914
See, this is a good example
of why I want to kill you...

04:48.991 --> 04:50.202
you're ignorant.

04:50.279 --> 04:52.014
Heed my words, Finn...

04:52.091 --> 04:55.520
as the Miller's wheel
forever outrages the seed,

04:55.597 --> 04:59.467
so the good apple boringly
receives his neighbor's worm.

04:59.544 --> 05:00.601
The hey...?

05:00.678 --> 05:03.491
And all the corn
gets smooshed to grease,

05:03.568 --> 05:07.147
to grease under the
Miller's flipping wheel.

05:07.850 --> 05:09.891
You're getting greased!

05:09.968 --> 05:12.399
Tiffany, look, we
got to work together, right?

05:12.476 --> 05:14.208
Why don't we let
bygones be bygones?

05:14.285 --> 05:16.460
Bygones?! Ha!

05:17.019 --> 05:18.310
That's you.

05:18.387 --> 05:20.850
Bye-gone!

05:21.636 --> 05:23.959
- Do you want my peach?
- Bye-gone!

05:24.036 --> 05:26.088
Hey! Stand down, cadets!

05:26.165 --> 05:27.766
Retire to your bunks!

05:27.843 --> 05:29.583
Tonight, lights out.

05:29.660 --> 05:32.369
Tomorrow, your eyes out!

05:34.000 --> 05:40.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:42.736 --> 05:43.992
- Unh!
- Unh!

05:44.069 --> 05:47.023
What the stork, man?
This is my special sword.

05:47.100 --> 05:49.829
Why didn't you take one of those
ant swords they offered you back there?

05:49.906 --> 05:53.118
I don't need some fancy
thinger to kick butt

05:53.195 --> 05:54.962
when I've got these!

05:55.039 --> 05:56.562
You know about these?

05:56.639 --> 05:58.107
- No...
- You will.

05:58.184 --> 06:03.047
Anyway, I just kind of wanted your
sword 'cause it's pretty cool, I guess.

06:03.124 --> 06:05.712
Whatever. I'll get it soon enough...

06:05.789 --> 06:08.094
From off your dead corpse,
you chump!

06:10.743 --> 06:12.339
Hey, Tiffany...

06:12.600 --> 06:15.159
- you know,
we're really not so different, you and I.

06:15.236 --> 06:16.364
Bullstuff.

06:16.480 --> 06:18.050
Well, we're both friends
with Jake,

06:18.127 --> 06:19.636
and that's something, right?

06:19.713 --> 06:21.816
I <i> was</i> friends with Jake.

06:21.893 --> 06:25.405
Then some baritone herb
stole him away from me.

06:25.482 --> 06:27.343
I didn't steal him. We're brot...

06:27.420 --> 06:30.783
And when that snow-white
wiener dog is finally dead,

06:30.860 --> 06:33.881
Jake will be devastated...

06:34.057 --> 06:38.577
He'll need a shoulder to cry
whiny, Finn-style tears on,

06:38.654 --> 06:42.668
and that shoulder will
be mine... Tiffany's!

06:43.442 --> 06:47.650
Then I can get busy with
undoing your cheesy influence,

06:47.727 --> 06:49.295
plus, more!

06:49.934 --> 06:53.696
With my help, Jake'll become
the criminal juggernaut

06:53.773 --> 06:55.833
he was always meant to be.

06:57.980 --> 07:00.711
We won't just be robbing banks
anymore.

07:00.788 --> 07:03.352
We'll be robbing
the actual banks.

07:03.429 --> 07:05.585
The whole banks!
You get it?

07:05.662 --> 07:08.820
We're gonna steal
actual whole buildings.

07:08.897 --> 07:10.755
- Yeah, I get it.
- So don't tell me

07:10.832 --> 07:12.916
"we're not so different,
" okay?!

07:12.993 --> 07:14.880
We're opposites, you and me.

07:14.957 --> 07:17.144
Oil and goody-goody snow-white

07:17.221 --> 07:19.495
baby-vanilla-bean mitten water!

07:19.572 --> 07:21.451
Go, Tiffany!

07:23.058 --> 07:24.413
Man,

07:24.912 --> 07:27.662
that nut's gonna try and stick
me while I'm not even looking.

07:27.739 --> 07:29.032
Don't even stress it, Finn.

07:29.109 --> 07:31.605
You're Finn Mertens, man.
You got this.

07:32.026 --> 07:33.241
Man, I hope so.

07:33.318 --> 07:35.961
Finn! Get in here,
quick!

07:38.951 --> 07:40.312
The junction.

07:40.454 --> 07:42.622
There's something moving in the walls.

07:42.699 --> 07:43.562
It was like...

07:43.639 --> 07:46.970
Crk brk crnch crk brk brmble!

07:49.647 --> 07:52.325
Wallworms!
Holy cow!

07:52.700 --> 07:54.323
Dang it, Tiffany, not yet!

07:54.400 --> 07:56.402
We got to work together
to beat the worms!

07:56.522 --> 07:58.020
Here they come!

07:59.886 --> 08:03.191
Tiffany!

08:03.311 --> 08:06.172
Unh!

08:08.252 --> 08:09.930
- Oh, snap! Look out!
- Oh, snap! Look out!

08:10.007 --> 08:11.946
- They're coming in from the side!
- They're coming in from the side!

08:28.223 --> 08:31.207
- You good?
- My tooth hurts.

08:53.144 --> 08:54.748
Dang! It's the head worm,

08:54.825 --> 08:56.279
and she's livid!

08:56.356 --> 08:59.265
- I say we get the heck out of h-e-e-e-e-ere!
- Finn!

08:59.342 --> 09:01.291
Tiffany, quick! Pull me up!

09:01.380 --> 09:03.418
Quick, Tiffany! I'm slipping!

09:04.272 --> 09:06.396
Dang it, Tiffany! Weren't
you paying attention?

09:06.473 --> 09:07.954
We're two peas in a pod!

09:08.031 --> 09:10.690
We're not oil and water.
We're oil and vinegar.

09:10.767 --> 09:12.596
It's good, man. It's yummy!

09:12.673 --> 09:14.971
- Mm...
- It's good for you!

09:15.135 --> 09:16.873
You're right, Finn.

09:16.950 --> 09:19.280
I can't bring myself to do it.

09:19.768 --> 09:23.099
But I can't bring myself
to save you, either.

09:23.936 --> 09:25.675
Why are you still smiling?

09:25.766 --> 09:27.389
Sorry. I didn't hear what you said.

09:27.466 --> 09:29.661
- I was just gonna let it slide.
- Look,

09:29.738 --> 09:32.792
you're... you're on your own. I'm sorry.

09:32.869 --> 09:34.710
Catch you on the flip, I guess.

09:34.787 --> 09:35.980
Tiffany?

09:36.057 --> 09:39.301
Tiffa... n-o-o-o-o-o-o-o!

09:46.533 --> 09:51.551
Unh! Aaaaaaaaaaaah!

09:53.304 --> 09:56.044
Whoa! Easy, son. Don't try to speak.

09:56.145 --> 09:58.471
- Your mouth is full of ants.
- Huh?

09:58.548 --> 10:00.534
It's okay. We just finished up.

10:00.611 --> 10:01.861
Ah.

10:02.998 --> 10:05.205
What happened down there? Where's Tiffany?

10:05.282 --> 10:08.245
Well, the good news is, the
worm queen was defeated...

10:08.322 --> 10:10.128
choked to death on some foreign object...

10:10.205 --> 10:11.794
presumably Cadet Tiffany,

10:11.871 --> 10:13.447
who is missing in action,

10:13.524 --> 10:16.350
- which is the bad news.
- Tiffany...

10:16.427 --> 10:19.770
But we didn't have to fix his
teeth, which is nice news...

10:19.847 --> 10:23.005
But we did have to fix your
teeth, which is okay news.

10:23.082 --> 10:25.647
Huh huh. 'Eyyy!

10:25.738 --> 10:27.879
So, on behalf of the ant nation,
I'd like to thank you

10:27.956 --> 10:29.861
for your service,
which is now concluded.

10:29.938 --> 10:32.241
As soon as you're ready, we'll
get you stuffed back up that

10:32.318 --> 10:34.241
well with all the snakes and butter.

10:36.071 --> 10:37.336
Holy cow.

10:37.413 --> 10:39.797
Hooray!

10:40.955 --> 10:43.367
- Welcome home, Finn.
- Yeah.

10:43.444 --> 10:45.046
Welcome home, buddy.

10:45.123 --> 10:46.243
Thanks, you guys!

10:46.320 --> 10:47.600
Man, you'll never believe it.

10:47.677 --> 10:50.258
- Dentist is actually...
- Eh-eh-eh!

10:51.653 --> 10:53.491
It was crazy. Tiffany was there...

10:53.568 --> 10:54.821
Hey, deh-deh-deh!

10:55.748 --> 10:56.883
Wait. You all knew?

10:56.960 --> 10:57.932
What the heck?

10:58.009 --> 10:59.906
- Why didn't you tell...
- Eh-eh-eh!
