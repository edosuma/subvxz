00:58.179 --> 01:01.048
This is
the cook's delight floor plan

01:01.050 --> 01:05.351
with exotic granite island
and walk-in pantry.

01:05.352 --> 01:07.090
Everything top-of-the-line.

01:07.856 --> 01:11.124
There are solid birch cabinets
with Whisper Touch hinges.

01:11.126 --> 01:12.692
Oh, and this dishwasher,

01:12.694 --> 01:15.662
it's got a two-pump motor
that's virtually silent.

01:15.664 --> 01:17.897
It's on right now.
You can't even hear it.

01:17.899 --> 01:20.433
- I love the stainless steel.
- Yeah, it's so sophisticated.

01:20.435 --> 01:22.234
It's definitely a lot of space.

01:22.236 --> 01:23.936
It is a lot of space.

01:23.938 --> 01:27.005
It's a lot of privacy.
No one right on top of you.

01:27.007 --> 01:30.946
And if it's not <i>enough</i> space,
check this out.

01:37.084 --> 01:39.951
- Whoa, is that safe?
- Well, it's a loophole.

01:39.953 --> 01:42.287
They leave them unfinished so
they can push the square footage

01:42.289 --> 01:45.257
on the other floors
to the single-family maximum,

01:45.259 --> 01:48.229
and then you can get a permit
to finish the basement later.

01:48.962 --> 01:50.162
So there's nothing down there?

01:50.164 --> 01:53.935
Nope, nothing but possibility.

01:55.970 --> 01:59.204
Saltwater pool,
which is great for your skin,

01:59.206 --> 02:00.938
and if it's too modest for you,

02:00.940 --> 02:04.476
we can upgrade to a princess
deck or a tanning ledge.

02:04.478 --> 02:06.477
Yeah, pool's for the kids,
mostly.

02:06.479 --> 02:09.045
Oh, wonderful.
How many do you have?

02:09.048 --> 02:11.450
One from my first marriage,
two from the second.

02:11.452 --> 02:13.284
I'm wife number three.

02:13.286 --> 02:14.920
Well, third time's a charm.

02:14.922 --> 02:17.255
Yeah, or three strikes,
you're out.

02:17.257 --> 02:18.860
Fuck you, Barry.

02:19.727 --> 02:21.159
Well, Harden is...

02:21.161 --> 02:23.962
Harding is a wonderful place
to raise a family.

02:23.964 --> 02:26.064
My daughter and I just moved
here, and she loves it.

02:26.066 --> 02:27.935
There's...

02:31.003 --> 02:33.038
It's probably just kids.

02:35.508 --> 02:37.744
That does not sound like kids.

02:38.512 --> 02:40.948
Shit, that's Mrs. Sherman.

02:41.915 --> 02:43.949
Help me!

02:43.951 --> 02:45.316
Help!

02:45.318 --> 02:46.451
Shouldn't we call the police?

02:46.453 --> 02:47.988
Please help me!

02:50.388 --> 02:52.422
Hello?

02:52.424 --> 02:54.091
Help!

03:07.839 --> 03:10.039
How do you know how do to that?

03:10.041 --> 03:13.210
They put these shit doors
on all these models.

03:13.212 --> 03:15.045
Call the cops!

03:15.047 --> 03:16.880
Help!

03:16.882 --> 03:18.349
Help!

03:18.351 --> 03:21.318
Please help!

03:21.320 --> 03:23.486
Please!

03:23.488 --> 03:26.426
- Jesus!
- Help me, please!

03:28.160 --> 03:30.361
I don't know what happened.

03:30.363 --> 03:32.062
- The bank.
- We got him.

03:32.064 --> 03:33.430
We have to lift.

03:33.432 --> 03:35.432
You're going to be okay.
He's going to be okay.

03:35.434 --> 03:37.432
I'm going to hold him.
You go get a chair.

03:37.434 --> 03:39.170
And we'll disconnect him.

03:39.570 --> 03:41.005
Aah!

03:43.207 --> 03:45.374
Aah!

03:45.376 --> 03:46.475
No!

03:49.113 --> 03:50.580
Kill me.

03:52.450 --> 03:53.849
Just kill me.

04:00.357 --> 04:02.825
Fucking kill me!

04:51.208 --> 04:54.543
- How fun was that? Right?
- Fine.

04:54.545 --> 04:56.879
Okay, I'll see you
in a couple weeks.

04:56.881 --> 04:59.014
- You look gorgeous.
- Hey, sweetheart.

04:59.016 --> 05:00.214
Hey, Mom.

05:00.216 --> 05:01.318
I'll get a kiss next time.

05:03.888 --> 05:05.490
So how was the weekend?

05:06.256 --> 05:08.192
- Great.
- Yeah?

05:10.194 --> 05:13.494
You know, I'm worried about her.

05:13.496 --> 05:19.333
She's 14 and the product
of a broken home, so...

05:19.335 --> 05:22.035
Yeah.
She's failing geometry.

05:22.037 --> 05:23.304
Yeah, I don't know.
I talked to her teacher.

05:23.306 --> 05:24.604
I don't know what
to say about that.

05:24.606 --> 05:26.172
We don't have to get into it
right now,

05:26.174 --> 05:29.643
but, you know, she could
come back to Phoenix.

05:29.645 --> 05:31.311
You could both come back.

05:31.313 --> 05:33.583
Oh. How's Kelsey?

05:34.316 --> 05:36.986
Good. She's good.
Thanks for asking.

05:38.121 --> 05:40.157
Come on, Cass.

05:40.924 --> 05:43.924
All Morgan's friends are there.
It'd be good for her.

05:43.926 --> 05:45.426
- My job is here.
- I know.

05:45.428 --> 05:47.294
My home is here.
My life is here.

05:47.296 --> 05:49.996
We're good.
Everything's fine.

05:49.998 --> 05:50.933
Okay.

05:52.167 --> 05:53.701
So should we get her a tutor?

05:53.703 --> 05:55.201
And if it's a question of money,

05:55.203 --> 05:56.403
I'm more than happy
to pay for it.

05:56.405 --> 05:58.205
- I don't need your help.
- Okay.

05:58.207 --> 06:00.507
Thank you.
I got it under control.

06:00.509 --> 06:02.044
Okay. All right.

06:03.377 --> 06:05.312
What's with the grass?

06:05.314 --> 06:07.984
I think they're trying to do it
to keep the property values up.

06:08.550 --> 06:11.317
Going around painting
all the dead lawns green.

06:11.319 --> 06:12.954
Interesting.

06:15.589 --> 06:16.957
- All right.
- Okay.

06:16.959 --> 06:18.490
I'll see you in a couple weeks.

06:18.492 --> 06:21.361
- All right.
- You look great.

06:21.363 --> 06:22.464
No, I don't.

06:55.128 --> 06:57.095
<i>One more.</i>

06:57.097 --> 06:58.530
<i>All right.
Here we go.</i>

06:58.532 --> 07:00.499
<i>Give me a jab, right side.
Kick it out.</i>

07:00.501 --> 07:02.634
Looking good, baby!

07:02.636 --> 07:04.069
This is stupid.

07:04.071 --> 07:05.403
I gained like two pounds
last week.

07:05.405 --> 07:07.372
- Did not.
- <i>Double jab right here.</i>

07:07.374 --> 07:08.639
<i>Two, two to the back.</i>

07:08.641 --> 07:10.242
You just got to
have fun with it.

07:10.244 --> 07:14.045
Kick, punch, out, poo!
The boxer!

07:14.047 --> 07:15.514
Up and ooh and ooh
and ooh and ooh and ooh!

07:15.516 --> 07:18.417
You're so annoying.
Stop.

07:18.419 --> 07:21.389
I'm annoying, but you love me.

07:23.090 --> 07:26.225
Okay, super-healthy lunch today.

07:26.227 --> 07:28.029
Great.

07:38.604 --> 07:41.705
- What are you listening to?
- None of your business.

07:41.707 --> 07:45.011
Oh, great, that's my favorite.

07:46.512 --> 07:48.214
Were you smoking in here?

07:49.681 --> 07:52.318
What?
No, I don't smoke.

07:55.320 --> 07:57.054
Those are for clients.

07:57.056 --> 07:58.424
What clients?

08:15.308 --> 08:17.241
Madison's mom is going to
pick you guys up today.

08:17.243 --> 08:19.710
- Cool?
- Are you showing our house?

08:19.712 --> 08:23.646
No, although there has been
a lot of interest.

08:23.648 --> 08:25.848
Good.
Can't fucking wait.

08:25.850 --> 08:27.519
- Morgan.
- What?

08:28.787 --> 08:30.353
It's going to get better.

08:30.355 --> 08:31.754
How?

08:31.756 --> 08:33.857
It just will. It does.

08:33.859 --> 08:37.227
That's... That's how
things work, I promise.

08:37.229 --> 08:39.297
I'm not stupid.

08:46.205 --> 08:47.407
Bye.

08:48.407 --> 08:49.872
<i>Stupid mortgage industry</i>

08:49.874 --> 08:52.342
<i>started treating
these nothing-down,</i>

08:52.344 --> 08:55.712
<i>no-job, no-assets,
no-credit-record loans</i>

08:55.714 --> 09:00.416
<i>as if they were prime loans,
as if they were real mortgages.</i>

09:00.418 --> 09:03.152
<i>And they were crap.</i>

09:03.154 --> 09:05.421
Hello?

09:05.423 --> 09:06.857
Can I speak to Cassandra Fowler?

09:06.859 --> 09:09.226
Uh, no, I'm sorry.
She's not in.

09:09.228 --> 09:11.261
Uh, I have this
as her personal cell.

09:11.263 --> 09:13.198
Uh, nope, office, sorry.

09:14.197 --> 09:15.733
Who am I talking to?

09:16.367 --> 09:19.635
Uh, this is
Ms. Fowler's assistant.

09:19.637 --> 09:22.306
- Do you have a name?
- Phoenix.

09:22.839 --> 09:24.539
Well, Phoenix, this is Brenda

09:24.541 --> 09:26.241
with Desert National
Bank and Trust.

09:26.243 --> 09:27.842
I'm calling on Ms. Fowler's
mortgage payment

09:27.844 --> 09:29.310
in addition to multiple...

09:29.312 --> 09:31.146
Uh, I have someone
on the other line.

09:31.148 --> 09:32.714
I'll have her call you as soon
as she gets in. Sorry, bye.

09:33.917 --> 09:35.617
- Hey, Gary.
- Let me guess.

09:35.619 --> 09:37.886
You're almost here, but you
got stopped at the train.

09:37.888 --> 09:39.688
- I did.
- That's bullshit.

09:39.690 --> 09:41.256
It's coming.

09:41.258 --> 09:42.891
The least you could
fucking do is show up...

10:19.695 --> 10:21.564
This motherfucker.

10:22.531 --> 10:24.701
Yeah, take your fucking time.

10:29.406 --> 10:32.573
Um, what is with
those fuck-me boots?

10:32.575 --> 10:34.210
It's for the showing.

10:34.743 --> 10:36.644
Well, that's a swing and a miss.

10:36.646 --> 10:38.513
Next time I'd go
with high heels.

10:38.515 --> 10:42.253
They give the illusion of longer
legs, which men find appealing.

10:46.356 --> 10:49.556
If I had tits, I would sell
10 times as many houses.

10:49.558 --> 10:51.490
I wish I had tits.

10:51.492 --> 10:54.429
I'd have nice tits, too,
and I'd put them to work.

10:55.264 --> 10:56.629
Why the fuck are you late?

10:56.631 --> 10:59.265
Because I had to drop Morgan off
12 miles away.

10:59.267 --> 11:02.568
It's not my fault there's
no high school in this town.

11:02.570 --> 11:03.704
Why do you live here, then?

11:03.706 --> 11:06.505
Because somebody
showed me a house

11:06.507 --> 11:09.578
and told me it was a wonderful
place to raise a family.

11:13.414 --> 11:15.315
That did happen, didn't it?

11:15.317 --> 11:16.950
And I feel terrible about it,

11:16.952 --> 11:18.552
and that is why you still
have a job here,

11:18.554 --> 11:20.954
so if you think about it,

11:20.956 --> 11:24.457
you should be on your knees
fucking thanking me for this.

11:24.459 --> 11:25.759
Thank you, Gary.

11:25.761 --> 11:27.360
That seemed disingenuous.

11:29.597 --> 11:31.264
Hello?

11:31.266 --> 11:32.965
- You fucking ingrate.
- Cassandra Fowler?

11:32.967 --> 11:35.700
Uh, no, uh, she's still out.
Can I take a message?

11:35.702 --> 11:37.570
So here's the deal, Cassandra.

11:37.572 --> 11:38.937
You can play your little game,

11:38.939 --> 11:40.906
but I'm going to keep
calling and calling.

11:40.908 --> 11:42.974
Yes, yes, I know.

11:42.976 --> 11:45.043
I, um...

11:45.045 --> 11:46.878
I'm not playing any games.

11:46.880 --> 11:48.013
Hey, Gary.

11:48.015 --> 11:50.315
Oh, hey, man.

11:50.317 --> 11:52.350
- Yes, yes.
- Hey, cool!

11:52.352 --> 11:54.420
You may not have all day
to play with me...

11:54.422 --> 11:55.655
- What's up, man?
- You didn't call.

11:55.657 --> 11:56.821
Oh, uh...

11:56.823 --> 11:58.623
I know. I know. I know. I know.

11:58.625 --> 12:01.459
I have a, um... I know.
I have a showing later.

12:01.461 --> 12:02.394
And the commission
on this would...

12:02.396 --> 12:03.662
You have missed

12:03.664 --> 12:04.964
six straight mortgage payments,
sweetie.

12:04.966 --> 12:06.498
You can't shit a shitter.

12:06.500 --> 12:08.667
Yeah, I'm not...
I'm... I'm not trying to...

12:08.669 --> 12:11.304
I'm not shitting you, okay?
I-I promise.

12:11.306 --> 12:12.838
- Did you fuckin' lie to me?
- I did not lie to you.

12:12.840 --> 12:14.473
- That's what you fucking said.
- I did not lie to you.

12:14.475 --> 12:15.740
Okay, so you didn't say
that my house

12:15.742 --> 12:17.442
would double in its value
in two years?

12:17.444 --> 12:20.780
Lie. You said, "Oh, everybody
takes an adjusted rate."

12:20.782 --> 12:22.348
Another fucking lie.

12:22.350 --> 12:23.848
- Hey, hey, moron!
- Hold on a second.

12:23.850 --> 12:25.750
If you can't afford a house,
don't fucking buy it.

12:25.752 --> 12:27.685
- There's some advice for you.
- Don't call me a fucking moron.

12:27.687 --> 12:29.787
- I'm still here. Geez.
- No, I don't hold on.

12:32.692 --> 12:34.892
Sorry. I just needed
to get somewhere quiet.

12:34.894 --> 12:38.029
Look, Ms. Fowler,
I am trying to help you here.

12:38.031 --> 12:39.798
Are you listening to me?

12:39.800 --> 12:42.733
You don't blame the guy who sold
the idiot the magic beans.

12:42.735 --> 12:45.536
You blame the idiot who traded
his cow for the magic beans.

12:45.538 --> 12:47.072
That's not what happened
in the story.

12:47.074 --> 12:49.340
- The magic beans work.
- Who gives a fuck about beans?

12:49.342 --> 12:50.607
I'm not talk...
Get out of my fucking office.

12:50.609 --> 12:52.510
Make me.
Fucking make me leave.

12:52.512 --> 12:54.079
- What are you gonna do, hit me?
- You think I'm afraid of you?

12:54.081 --> 12:55.979
Think I'm a-fucking-fraid?
Don't fucking hit me.

12:55.981 --> 12:57.515
Fuck you are.

12:57.517 --> 12:59.083
You motherfucking piece of shit!
Get out of here!

12:59.085 --> 13:00.718
- No, I'm not!
- Don't forget.

13:00.720 --> 13:04.856
Nonviolently, this company
will end your life.

13:04.858 --> 13:08.059
I'm trying to save your life.

13:08.061 --> 13:09.660
Again, I'm not threatening you.

13:09.662 --> 13:11.595
This may sound like
a threat, and it's not,

13:11.597 --> 13:12.962
but I'm trying
to save your life.

13:12.964 --> 13:15.098
- You mother...
- Aah!

13:22.608 --> 13:24.010
Gary?

13:27.780 --> 13:30.450
Oh, fuck me.

13:38.590 --> 13:40.092
Shit.

13:47.700 --> 13:49.165
He attacked me.

13:49.167 --> 13:51.834
That was an accident
'cause he was attacking me.

13:51.836 --> 13:55.038
Okay.
We should call the cops.

13:55.040 --> 13:56.606
No, no, no, no.
We shouldn't call the cops.

13:56.608 --> 13:58.574
Gary's fine.
He just hit his head.

13:58.576 --> 14:01.711
That's all. So there's not
any reason to bother the cops.

14:01.713 --> 14:04.783
Okay, um, I want to call
the, uh, ambulance, please.

14:07.017 --> 14:08.951
Okay, yeah.
Call an ambulance.

14:08.953 --> 14:10.586
Yeah, why wouldn't
we call an ambulance?

14:10.588 --> 14:12.455
Of course.
We got to help him.

14:12.457 --> 14:14.157
Okay.
We could call the police, too.

14:14.159 --> 14:16.591
Just let them know
that no one's hurt or anything

14:16.593 --> 14:18.594
and that everything's okay
and that we're all fine.

14:18.596 --> 14:20.462
I'm sorry.

14:20.464 --> 14:21.599
I'm a really good person.

14:45.088 --> 14:46.989
Hi.
How are you?

14:46.991 --> 14:50.024
How do you feel?

14:50.026 --> 14:52.561
How... How are you?

14:52.563 --> 14:56.230
You okay?
Is that bag too heavy?

14:56.232 --> 14:57.666
I put it on there
for the swelling.

14:57.668 --> 14:58.970
It might be overkill.

15:00.536 --> 15:02.604
You know,
I invented this product. Yeah.

15:02.606 --> 15:04.409
I'm a small business owner.

15:04.942 --> 15:06.807
Yeah, you know,
my ex-wife always liked

15:06.809 --> 15:09.478
to put ice cubes in her wine,

15:09.480 --> 15:11.580
but the problem was that,
once the ice cubes would melt,

15:11.582 --> 15:13.782
it would just, like,
make the wine all, like, watery

15:13.784 --> 15:15.584
and taste like shit,

15:15.586 --> 15:18.519
so, one day, I was thinking...
lightbulb moment...

15:18.521 --> 15:21.223
"What if the ice
was made of wine?"

15:21.225 --> 15:23.691
That way, when it melted,
it would just make the wine,

15:23.693 --> 15:25.594
like, have more wine.

15:25.596 --> 15:28.696
I call it Wice... wine and ice.

15:28.698 --> 15:31.899
Yeah. The guys from Big Lots
are really into the idea,

15:31.901 --> 15:33.902
so there's that.
It could possibly happen,

15:33.904 --> 15:35.806
which would be awesome.

15:39.107 --> 15:40.974
I just want to apologize
to you, okay?

15:40.976 --> 15:44.277
I never should have
struck you, okay?

15:44.279 --> 15:45.812
That was uncalled for.

15:45.814 --> 15:47.982
I-I don't know
where my head went.

15:47.984 --> 15:49.749
I just panicked.
You know?

15:49.751 --> 15:51.919
I'm in the middle of this
custody battle with my ex-wife,

15:51.921 --> 15:54.522
and I just love my two sons
more than anything in the world,

15:54.524 --> 15:56.757
and just the thought
of losing them, it just...

15:56.759 --> 15:59.826
I don't know. I mean,
I can't really deal with it.

15:59.828 --> 16:01.695
And I can't have
another run-in with the cops,

16:01.697 --> 16:03.897
and, you know,
I'm just gonna say it aloud.

16:06.001 --> 16:07.700
Gary is dead.

16:07.702 --> 16:10.304
Oh, God.

16:10.306 --> 16:11.972
I can't believe it myself.

16:11.974 --> 16:13.977
Hey, buddy.

16:15.211 --> 16:17.044
You know, I'm not saying
it's not my fault.

16:17.046 --> 16:18.711
I mean, I do obviously
have a bad temper,

16:18.713 --> 16:19.946
which is a good thing
in business.

16:19.948 --> 16:21.581
I mean, you got to be a shark.

16:21.583 --> 16:23.049
But it's really Gary's bad, too.

16:23.051 --> 16:24.851
I mean, he should
never have started that.

16:24.853 --> 16:26.953
I mean, he lied to me
and was rude to me

16:26.955 --> 16:28.954
and called me a fucking moron,

16:28.956 --> 16:30.957
and, to be honest, I thought
he was gonna catch himself,

16:30.959 --> 16:33.059
but, instead, he just went
right over the thing.

16:33.061 --> 16:35.096
It was gross.

16:36.330 --> 16:38.267
Lefty likes you.

16:40.268 --> 16:42.571
Hey.

16:43.138 --> 16:45.508
Please don't kill me.

16:47.042 --> 16:49.612
Would you like to take
a tour of my house?

16:51.946 --> 16:54.347
This was Vicki's crafting room.

16:54.349 --> 16:57.650
Now, I've changed it
into my personal gym. Up hers.

16:57.652 --> 17:00.252
I'm gonna get so fucking ripped.

17:00.254 --> 17:03.689
We spent a lot of time trying
to customize the standard plan.

17:03.691 --> 17:06.023
This was basically
Vicki's dream bathroom...

17:06.026 --> 17:09.994
his-and-hers sinks, Jacuzzi tub,
and heated tile floors.

17:09.997 --> 17:11.829
Yeah, this is where the pool's
gonna go, right here.

17:11.830 --> 17:13.365
I'm gonna do a little
swim-up bar right there.

17:13.367 --> 17:15.665
It's gonna be sexy as hell.

17:15.667 --> 17:18.368
Over there,
that's the golf course.

17:18.371 --> 17:20.739
Yeah, we're supposed
to be on the 9th hole,

17:20.741 --> 17:23.241
but they didn't, you know,
finish building the golf course.

17:23.242 --> 17:25.041
I say that's breach of contract,

17:25.044 --> 17:27.212
but apparently it wasn't
in the fucking contract.

17:27.214 --> 17:30.281
So that's my bad again.

17:30.283 --> 17:32.850
Criminals.
Oh, they don't play fair.

17:32.852 --> 17:35.055
- Do you golf?
- No.

17:35.923 --> 17:38.690
That's okay.
I'll teach you.

17:38.692 --> 17:41.626
You know, I'm not supposed
to play because of my back,

17:41.628 --> 17:44.829
but I still do
because I love it.

17:44.831 --> 17:47.264
Yeah, sometimes, I feel like

17:47.266 --> 17:49.970
it's the only thing
that keeps me sane.

17:54.742 --> 17:56.841
Yeah, basically,
you can control the whole house

17:56.843 --> 17:58.010
from this remote.

17:58.012 --> 17:59.844
Like, I can pick
any song I want,

17:59.846 --> 18:01.345
and I can just play it
whenever I want to.

18:01.347 --> 18:03.983
Like, check this out.

18:05.217 --> 18:08.818
Shit. It was supposed to play
Dave Matthews, "Ants Marching."

18:08.820 --> 18:11.021
God damn it.

18:11.023 --> 18:14.127
Okay, fuck it.
Come on. Let's go. Go.

18:15.028 --> 18:17.827
This is the master bedroom,
obviously.

18:17.829 --> 18:20.163
Oh, so, these are your kids?

18:20.165 --> 18:22.333
Oh, yeah.
Chase and Penn.

18:22.335 --> 18:25.102
Oh, they're a handful.
Always getting into trouble,

18:25.104 --> 18:28.204
just like their old man.
That's my ex-wife.

18:28.206 --> 18:31.008
Well, now I guess
I got to say <i>first</i> ex-wife.

18:31.010 --> 18:32.145
And that's me.

18:39.252 --> 18:42.185
I'm gonna reveal to you
my face now...

18:42.187 --> 18:44.890
out of a sign of trust, okay?

18:50.362 --> 18:54.096
We had these built-ins added
with the soft stop.

18:54.098 --> 18:56.466
Oh, I also had them
install this.

18:56.468 --> 18:59.702
Might want to take
a step back for this.

18:59.704 --> 19:02.841
Lights, camera, action.

19:05.977 --> 19:08.944
Yeah, boy!

19:08.946 --> 19:11.114
How wild is that, huh?

19:11.116 --> 19:13.850
Had this built so I could keep
them locked away from the boys.

19:13.852 --> 19:16.986
Don't want anybody accidentally
shooting themselves, you know?

19:16.988 --> 19:19.221
Yeah, this staircase
was also an upgrade.

19:19.223 --> 19:20.890
I chose it 'cause
I thought it reminded me

19:20.892 --> 19:22.791
of the staircase
from "Diff'rent Strokes."

19:22.793 --> 19:24.794
- Did you ever watch that show?
- Mm-hmm.

19:24.796 --> 19:26.829
Hey, I'm really sorry
about the mess, too.

19:26.831 --> 19:31.401
We were going to redo
the tile on the countertops,

19:31.403 --> 19:34.237
but you know what they say...
best laid plans...

19:34.239 --> 19:36.004
Oh.

19:36.006 --> 19:38.273
Maybe you can help
settle an argument.

19:38.275 --> 19:41.744
Okay, I want you to be
completely honest with me, okay?

19:41.746 --> 19:44.682
Which of these
do you like better?

19:46.217 --> 19:49.120
Uh, that's so hard.

19:49.987 --> 19:51.186
Well, I mean, it's granite.

19:51.188 --> 19:52.755
You're gonna live
with that forever.

19:52.757 --> 19:55.326
It's a really big decision.

19:56.993 --> 19:58.262
Don't make fun of me.

19:59.195 --> 20:00.932
I'm not.

20:03.032 --> 20:05.933
Look, I know that
this whole thing is weird, okay?

20:05.935 --> 20:08.871
I'm perfectly aware of how
strange this whole situation is.

20:08.873 --> 20:11.405
I just wanted to show you the
house because this is my home.

20:11.407 --> 20:12.807
It's who I am.

20:12.809 --> 20:14.942
You know,
if they foreclose on me,

20:14.944 --> 20:17.179
I'm gonna lose my boys.
Bye-bye, custody.

20:17.181 --> 20:19.515
You have no idea
what that feels like.

20:19.517 --> 20:22.253
I do.
I'm gonna lose my house, too.

20:23.286 --> 20:27.087
And I haven't told anybody,
but I'm completely underwater.

20:29.025 --> 20:30.960
Fuck.

20:34.931 --> 20:37.031
That sucks, Cassie.
I'm sorry.

20:37.033 --> 20:39.069
How did you know my name?

20:40.103 --> 20:42.937
Gar...
Uh, Gary used to talk about you.

20:42.939 --> 20:46.844
And then I also looked
in your wallet. Sorry.

20:47.376 --> 20:50.812
But you look really nice
in your driver's license photo.

20:50.814 --> 20:53.281
Fucking Gary.

20:53.283 --> 20:55.115
I can't believe
that fucking guy.

20:55.117 --> 20:57.218
I mean,
Gary sold me my house, too.

20:57.220 --> 21:00.153
I mean, it's not as nice
as yours, but it's a good house.

21:00.155 --> 21:02.856
It's a really good house,
and now it's not worth anything,

21:02.858 --> 21:06.893
and I'm stuck
in this fucking mess.

21:06.895 --> 21:08.429
I'm pissed!

21:08.431 --> 21:10.767
I'm really pissed!

21:12.968 --> 21:15.304
I'm sorry.

21:17.072 --> 21:19.038
So you know where
I'm coming from. You get it.

21:19.040 --> 21:21.240
We're good people. We don't
belong in this situation.

21:21.242 --> 21:23.376
- No, we're victims. Yeah.
- Exactly.

21:23.378 --> 21:25.911
You know, we don't have
to be against each other.

21:25.913 --> 21:28.380
The world's probably better off
with an asshole like Gary gone.

21:28.382 --> 21:30.217
- Right?
- We did somebody else a favor,

21:30.219 --> 21:32.319
- probably.
- I fucking hate him.

21:32.321 --> 21:35.287
Okay.

21:35.289 --> 21:37.122
Let's just be adults
about this, okay?

21:37.124 --> 21:41.928
We can come to
a reasonable solution to this.

21:41.930 --> 21:44.997
Okay, this is
what we're gonna do.

21:44.999 --> 21:46.568
All right.

21:47.603 --> 21:50.370
- I'm gonna let you go.
- Thank you.

21:50.372 --> 21:52.272
- If, if, if, if, if...
- Thank you!

21:52.274 --> 21:54.541
...if you promise me
you will never tell anyone

21:54.543 --> 21:56.176
- about this.
- I promise.

21:56.178 --> 21:58.044
You can't even talk about this
years from now.

21:58.046 --> 22:00.178
- You can't tell a fucking soul.
- Okay, I promise.

22:00.180 --> 22:02.180
Say that you were, like,
on a showing or something.

22:02.182 --> 22:03.581
- You didn't see anything.
- Right. I didn't.

22:03.583 --> 22:05.316
Yeah. What happened?
I don't know.

22:05.318 --> 22:06.552
Someone died?
Who gives a fuck?

22:06.554 --> 22:08.020
- Okay.
- All right. Fine.

22:08.022 --> 22:10.321
- Thank you.
- Good. No, thank <i>you.</i>

22:10.323 --> 22:12.056
Okay.
Okay, this is done.

22:12.058 --> 22:13.993
Good, good, good, good, good,
good, good, good.

22:13.995 --> 22:15.393
Okay. Here we go.

22:15.395 --> 22:17.898
Okay.

22:18.632 --> 22:21.500
The only thing that
doesn't really connect for me

22:21.502 --> 22:23.968
is, if you hate Gary so much,

22:23.970 --> 22:26.004
then why were you
sleeping with him?

22:26.006 --> 22:28.107
I wasn't sleeping with him.

22:28.109 --> 22:29.440
That's not what he said.

22:29.442 --> 22:32.578
Oh, God,
he's such a fucking liar!

22:32.580 --> 22:34.482
I would never sleep with him!

22:36.284 --> 22:38.984
Yeah, yeah, he is
a fucking liar.

22:38.986 --> 22:41.020
I mean, and that would be
a pretty crazy lie, too,

22:41.022 --> 22:43.254
'cause you guys don't even seem
like you'd make a good couple,

22:43.256 --> 22:45.658
and, plus, you're married,
so that'd be totally uncool.

22:45.660 --> 22:47.926
Well, I...
I'm not married, actually.

22:47.928 --> 22:50.261
I just wear the ring
to help me sell more houses.

22:54.668 --> 22:57.467
- To lie?
- What?

22:57.469 --> 23:00.406
You wear your ring
to lie to people?

23:01.274 --> 23:02.639
- No, I-I, um...
- You just say

23:02.641 --> 23:04.175
whatever you got to say

23:04.177 --> 23:05.976
to close the deal, don't you?

23:05.978 --> 23:08.346
No, I mean, I was married.

23:08.348 --> 23:09.714
This is my actual wedding ring.

23:09.716 --> 23:11.282
Lefty, shut up!

23:11.284 --> 23:13.551
I'm just...
I'm not married anymore.

23:13.553 --> 23:15.285
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
"I'm in the same boat as you!

23:15.287 --> 23:17.621
Gary did this." I almost
felt bad for you there.

23:17.623 --> 23:19.357
I was thinking we're in the same
position, but we're not.

23:19.359 --> 23:22.193
You're one of the fucking
assholes who put me here!

23:22.195 --> 23:24.995
Lefty, shut the fuck up!

23:28.234 --> 23:30.037
God damn it!

23:31.737 --> 23:33.570
I'm gonna have to
take him out for a walk

23:33.572 --> 23:35.605
because he's not gonna shut up
until he takes a shit, okay?

23:35.607 --> 23:37.741
That's the bottom line.
I know how he operates.

23:37.743 --> 23:40.042
And I'm tying you back up.
Get over here. Get over here!

23:40.044 --> 23:42.244
Come here. Come here. Come here.
Stay right there.

23:42.246 --> 23:44.447
Stay there.
Don't move. Don't move.

23:44.449 --> 23:46.316
I can fucking throw
this knife at you.

23:46.318 --> 23:50.056
Don't move.
Don't move, Cassie!

23:51.756 --> 23:53.255
Go, go, go.

23:53.257 --> 23:54.626
Get over there.
Get over there.

23:58.494 --> 24:02.264
Okay, sit down.
Sit down. Sit, sit, sit.

24:02.266 --> 24:03.599
What, do they teach
a seminar to you guys,

24:03.601 --> 24:05.301
just how to lie to people?

24:05.303 --> 24:07.204
Like, how to bullshit people,
how to trick people?

24:07.206 --> 24:09.172
Is that what they do?
Do you teach that seminar?

24:09.174 --> 24:11.608
I tried to be cool,
and you just lied to me.

24:11.610 --> 24:13.777
Stop. Cassie.
God damn it.

24:13.779 --> 24:16.012
Stop it. Stop it. Don't.

24:16.014 --> 24:18.749
This is a Ginsu knife
from fucking Kohl's, okay?

24:18.751 --> 24:20.716
It will cut through bone
like butter.

24:20.718 --> 24:22.651
I don't want to do it, but
I'll start right above the knee

24:22.653 --> 24:24.220
and cut you
to the fucking white meat.

24:24.222 --> 24:25.421
All righty?

24:25.423 --> 24:27.556
Don't be an asshole.

24:27.558 --> 24:29.759
I don't know why they make

24:29.761 --> 24:32.661
duct tape
so goddamn hard to get off!

24:32.663 --> 24:34.363
God damn it!

24:34.365 --> 24:36.464
It's like a cheap-ass roll
of fucking toilet paper

24:36.466 --> 24:39.137
that just keeps ripping.

24:40.804 --> 24:42.605
Uh-huh.

24:42.607 --> 24:44.376
Damn it.

24:47.244 --> 24:50.048
- Ow.
- All right.

24:52.250 --> 24:55.216
I'm gonna be back here
in seven to eight minutes, okay?

24:55.218 --> 24:56.684
Now, you can scream
if you want to,

24:56.686 --> 24:58.520
'cause I know you probably will,
but you should know

24:58.522 --> 25:01.156
that the closest occupied house
is, like...

25:01.158 --> 25:04.260
like, four cul-de-sacs away.

25:04.262 --> 25:07.195
Hey, buddy.
There's my buddy!

25:07.197 --> 25:09.231
Buddy, wanna go for a walk, huh?

25:09.233 --> 25:11.234
Who's a good...

25:11.768 --> 25:13.637
Hello?

25:19.341 --> 25:21.643
Shit.

25:21.645 --> 25:24.212
- What the fuck?
- What the hell are you doing?

25:24.214 --> 25:26.146
You're not allowed
to just show up here anymore.

25:26.148 --> 25:28.316
- What am <i>I</i> doing?
- Ah, fuck me!

25:28.318 --> 25:30.718
- What is this?
- Please call the police.

25:30.720 --> 25:33.387
- No, no! Don't, don't!
- Well, then tell me who she is.

25:33.389 --> 25:35.690
Okay, she, uh...
There was an accident.

25:35.692 --> 25:37.192
- He killed somebody.
- Shut up!

25:37.194 --> 25:39.126
You fucking killed somebody?!

25:39.128 --> 25:41.429
- Gary.
- Who... Who...

25:41.431 --> 25:44.164
- Gary, our real-estate guy?
- The real-estate guy, yes.

25:44.166 --> 25:46.233
It wasn't my fault, though. He
was supposed to catch himself.

25:46.235 --> 25:47.836
Oh, my God.
You are such an idiot.

25:47.838 --> 25:50.471
If it's an accident, most people
call the goddamn police.

25:50.473 --> 25:52.139
I know!
I'm not thinking straight.

25:52.141 --> 25:54.709
- Please, please! Help me.
- No, no.

25:54.711 --> 25:56.644
You don't need help.
She doesn't need help.

25:56.646 --> 25:58.511
I'm not gonna do anything
to her. I don't even know her.

25:58.513 --> 26:00.513
I'm just retaining her to make
sure she doesn't tell anyone.

26:00.515 --> 26:02.716
You're retaining her?
With duct tape?

26:02.718 --> 26:04.585
If she promises
not to say anything,

26:04.587 --> 26:05.719
then I'm just gonna let her go.

26:05.721 --> 26:07.688
That was our deal, right?
Right?

26:07.690 --> 26:10.891
- Please call the fucking cops!
- Why would you say that?!

26:10.893 --> 26:13.126
Okay, I gotta get out of here.

26:13.128 --> 26:14.694
- No, you're not leaving.
- No, I'm leaving.

26:14.696 --> 26:16.864
- No, no!
- No, this is your thing.

26:16.866 --> 26:18.598
- You deal with this.
- You're not fucking leaving.

26:18.600 --> 26:20.335
- I'd like to see you stop me.
- Vicki, don't...

26:22.605 --> 26:25.442
Aah!

26:27.209 --> 26:30.143
You are such an asshole.

26:30.145 --> 26:32.214
Goddamn, Cassie!

27:55.996 --> 27:57.297
Hold still.

28:01.535 --> 28:02.766
- Mm!
- Oops.

28:02.768 --> 28:04.369
What are you doing?

28:04.371 --> 28:05.937
You don't think
if something happens to me,

28:05.939 --> 28:07.805
you'll be the first person
people look for?

28:07.807 --> 28:09.774
Nothing's gonna happen
to you, okay?

28:09.776 --> 28:12.509
But you're a part of this now.
All right?

28:12.511 --> 28:14.011
If you back out,

28:14.013 --> 28:17.314
I'm gonna tell everybody
that you're an accomplice.

28:17.316 --> 28:19.851
An accomplice you had to tie
to a chair to keep here?

28:19.853 --> 28:22.352
- Prove it.
- Okay, how about all the bruises

28:22.354 --> 28:24.755
all over my arms and legs
from the fucking duct tape?

28:24.757 --> 28:27.890
I don't know. Maybe you enjoy
being tied up during sex...

28:27.892 --> 28:30.928
with Randall, the pool guy.

28:30.930 --> 28:32.996
Okay, smart-ass, how are
you gonna explain the big,

28:32.998 --> 28:35.298
giant baseball-sized egg
on the back of my head?

28:35.300 --> 28:38.669
- Fucking moron!
- You see how she talks to me?

28:38.671 --> 28:40.804
Constant nagging.
Guess what.

28:40.806 --> 28:42.573
We're not married anymore,
remember?

28:42.575 --> 28:44.641
That means I don't have
to listen to anything you say.

28:44.643 --> 28:47.777
Oh, like you listened...
like he listened so good before.

28:47.779 --> 28:49.912
You just shut up, okay?
Shh!

28:49.914 --> 28:51.614
Here's the plan.

28:51.616 --> 28:53.417
We're gonna take Gary's body,

28:53.419 --> 28:54.884
and we're gonna chop it up,
okay?

28:54.886 --> 28:56.687
We're gonna, like,
mush it into something.

28:56.689 --> 28:58.988
Then we'll burn him out...
with acid, not fire.

28:58.990 --> 29:01.324
We'll have to take care
of the teeth. I realize that.

29:01.326 --> 29:02.625
But we'll figure that out, okay?

29:02.627 --> 29:03.960
Then we're gonna take
his house keys,

29:03.962 --> 29:05.829
and we're gonna put them
inside his mailbox.

29:05.831 --> 29:08.032
People will just think that
he got underwater on his house,

29:08.034 --> 29:10.468
and he disappeared in the middle
of the night. Cinchy.

29:11.568 --> 29:13.468
I'm not helping you
with any of that.

29:13.470 --> 29:16.505
Oh, yes, you will.
Bet me you're not gonna do it.

29:16.507 --> 29:17.774
Sonny, what are
you gonna do with her?

29:17.776 --> 29:19.878
You gonna kill her, too?

29:21.379 --> 29:23.612
No.
I'm not gonna kill Cassie.

29:23.614 --> 29:24.880
I'm just gonna hold her here

29:24.882 --> 29:26.716
till you and I
can see eye to eye, okay?

29:26.718 --> 29:29.017
And you don't think anybody's
gonna notice she's missing?

29:29.019 --> 29:31.053
Who?
Her boss is dead.

29:31.055 --> 29:33.422
The wedding-ring thing's
a total sham.

29:33.424 --> 29:35.390
She's not married.
She told me she's single.

29:35.392 --> 29:36.525
I got all the answers
out of her.

29:36.527 --> 29:38.895
- I have a daughter.
- Huh?

29:38.897 --> 29:41.634
I live with my daughter.

29:44.602 --> 29:46.636
Jesus, Cassie!
What the fuck?!

29:46.638 --> 29:48.403
- Oh, my God.
- Damn it!

29:48.405 --> 29:50.939
- You are fucking unbelievable!
- Fuck you!

29:50.941 --> 29:53.476
Look, smart people don't
get away with murder, Sonny!

29:53.478 --> 29:55.611
What do you think
you're gonna do, Mr. GED?

29:55.613 --> 29:58.513
Shut up! I'm trying to get it
under control, God damn it!

29:58.515 --> 30:01.882
Oh, you're trying. He's trying.
Yeah, he's always trying.

30:01.884 --> 30:03.452
That's the thing.
He tries so hard.

30:03.454 --> 30:05.052
It's not his fault
he fucks everything up.

30:05.054 --> 30:07.089
You are so stupid.

30:07.091 --> 30:09.123
- I fuck everything up? Yeah?
- Yeah.

30:09.125 --> 30:10.758
All I did was provide for you.

30:10.760 --> 30:12.593
I took you to fucking Bermuda.

30:12.595 --> 30:15.464
You took me to your uncle's
piece-of-shit time-share.

30:15.466 --> 30:19.033
In May! That's a really hard
month to book in a time-share.

30:19.035 --> 30:20.802
You have to use
all your fucking points.

30:20.804 --> 30:22.937
- I bought you a house.
- Are you serious?

30:22.939 --> 30:24.773
- Yes.
- Are you dead goddamn serious?

30:24.775 --> 30:26.742
- Yes! Yes, this house.
- This house?

30:26.744 --> 30:28.409
The one they're about
to take from you?

30:28.411 --> 30:30.678
You are pathetic.

30:30.680 --> 30:32.813
Hey, Sonny,
let me ask you a question,

30:32.815 --> 30:34.850
just 'cause we haven't
chitchatted in a while.

30:34.852 --> 30:38.754
Um, how's that wine
ice cube business doing?

30:38.756 --> 30:42.556
It's fucking Wice!

30:42.558 --> 30:45.627
Vic? Vicki?

30:45.629 --> 30:46.763
Oh, God.

30:47.697 --> 30:49.765
No!

30:51.466 --> 30:52.636
Vicki?

30:53.402 --> 30:55.535
Oh, fuck.
Oh.

30:55.537 --> 30:57.905
- Oh, my God.
- Oh. Oh.

31:00.743 --> 31:02.542
Holy...

31:02.544 --> 31:04.110
Oh, shit.

31:04.112 --> 31:07.114
Oh, fuck!
I think we killed her.

31:11.187 --> 31:12.986
Okay, Vic.
Come on.

31:20.763 --> 31:22.765
Oh!

31:27.035 --> 31:28.636
Ohh.

31:28.638 --> 31:31.172
Oh, my God.
Oh, God.

31:31.174 --> 31:32.606
Ohh.

31:32.608 --> 31:34.506
Why did she have to do this?

31:34.508 --> 31:37.810
Why couldn't
she have just been nice?

31:37.812 --> 31:41.548
She should have been nice.
She should have been nice.

31:41.550 --> 31:43.148
She shouldn't have been mean
to you.

31:43.150 --> 31:46.085
She should have been nice.

31:46.087 --> 31:48.991
- It's okay.
- Will you tell the truth?

31:49.957 --> 31:51.758
About what?

31:51.760 --> 31:53.225
About your daughter.

31:53.227 --> 31:55.663
Do you have a daughter?

31:57.532 --> 31:58.768
No.

32:05.674 --> 32:08.110
So you were lying?

32:08.877 --> 32:11.614
This was all for nothing?

32:18.686 --> 32:20.919
You're still lying.

32:20.921 --> 32:23.824
She's only 14.

33:10.669 --> 33:12.670
<i>One more!</i>

33:12.672 --> 33:14.739
<i>All right. Give me
a step-touch to the back.</i>

33:14.741 --> 33:16.641
<i>Take it down and up.</i>

34:17.034 --> 34:19.768
<i>One more.
All right. Here we go.</i>

34:19.771 --> 34:21.871
<i>Give me a jab right side.</i>

34:21.873 --> 34:22.942
<i>Take it out.</i>

34:27.646 --> 34:30.614
- Hello.
- Hi.

34:30.616 --> 34:33.215
Are you, uh,
Cassie Fowler's daughter?

34:33.217 --> 34:35.351
What's going on?

34:35.353 --> 34:38.621
Well, there's not really
an easy way to say this,

34:38.623 --> 34:41.257
but your mother's been
in a horrific car accident,

34:41.259 --> 34:44.661
and she sent me here
to come bring you to her.

34:44.663 --> 34:48.696
Oh, my God.
Fuck. Um, hold on.

34:48.697 --> 34:50.634
It's pretty intense.
There's been a lot of bleeding.

34:51.636 --> 34:53.067
We don't have to call anyone

34:53.069 --> 34:54.902
because I can just take you
to where she's at.

34:54.904 --> 34:58.107
We can just go ahead and get
there now if you open this door.

35:05.015 --> 35:07.716
Huh.

35:07.718 --> 35:11.319
You know, she gave me her phone
so that I could call you.

35:11.321 --> 35:13.254
But you didn't call me.

35:13.256 --> 35:15.024
Well, you know, if I got lost.

35:15.026 --> 35:16.991
Okay, we don't really
have a lot of time.

35:16.993 --> 35:18.326
Your mom's life depends on...

35:18.328 --> 35:20.164
- I'm gonna call my dad.
- No, you're not.

35:20.698 --> 35:22.665
Oh! Get out!
Oh, my God!

35:22.667 --> 35:25.234
- Ow! Ow!
- Aah! Aah!

35:25.236 --> 35:26.901
Get out!
Get out!

35:26.903 --> 35:29.807
Aah!

35:47.956 --> 35:50.193
Where is it?

36:07.242 --> 36:10.144
911.
What's your emergency?

36:10.146 --> 36:12.146
There's someone in my house.

36:12.148 --> 36:15.282
Oh, an intruder?
Okay.

36:15.284 --> 36:18.052
And are you at 539 Sunset Lane?

36:18.054 --> 36:21.121
- Yeah, please come.
- And where are you?

36:21.123 --> 36:23.089
In my mom's room.

36:23.091 --> 36:26.292
Oh, okay.
And, uh, where exactly is that?

36:26.294 --> 36:28.194
What?

36:28.196 --> 36:30.830
I just need to be able
to tell my officers

36:30.832 --> 36:34.770
where they should go to once
they arrive at the homestead.

36:35.803 --> 36:37.873
Upstairs.

36:39.140 --> 36:42.042
Upstairs?
Okay.

36:42.044 --> 36:44.111
The bedroom. It's right
down the end of the hall.

36:44.113 --> 36:45.478
Well, stay where you are.

36:45.480 --> 36:49.949
Someone will be there
in one second, okay?

37:17.110 --> 37:18.279
Aah!

37:19.479 --> 37:20.512
Get back here!

37:20.514 --> 37:23.017
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

38:26.446 --> 38:28.112
Fucking phone!

38:28.114 --> 38:29.947
Okay.

38:29.949 --> 38:32.116
Okay. Okay.

38:47.532 --> 38:49.867
Where does your dad live?
Does he live close to here?

38:49.869 --> 38:53.072
- No.
- Good.

38:54.472 --> 38:55.905
So, what's up with him?

38:55.907 --> 38:58.310
Why did him and your mom
get a divorce?

39:00.412 --> 39:02.446
Hey, what, you find a fry
in there or something?

39:02.448 --> 39:04.113
- Shut up!
- <i>You</i> shut up.

39:04.115 --> 39:06.585
Knock that shit off.

39:08.119 --> 39:10.053
Actually, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean that.

39:10.055 --> 39:11.524
I have kids, and that was mean.

39:54.565 --> 39:57.970
Aah! Aah!

39:59.002 --> 40:00.404
Oh.

40:39.109 --> 40:41.142
Fuck.

40:43.347 --> 40:45.312
Come on.

40:45.314 --> 40:48.415
Wipe your feet. I don't need
you tracking dirt clods in here.

40:48.417 --> 40:51.051
Aw, Jesus Christ, buddy!
You're a mess!

40:51.053 --> 40:53.455
- Is that blood?
- Yes, God damn it.

40:53.457 --> 40:55.557
That's a bad boy!
Get outside!

40:55.559 --> 40:57.627
Outside... now!

41:01.263 --> 41:03.098
Oh, fuck me.

41:05.001 --> 41:08.405
<i>We're gonna whup that ass.</i>

41:33.395 --> 41:34.762
Oh, my...

41:34.764 --> 41:37.297
Down! Down!

41:39.101 --> 41:41.704
I need your phone!

41:43.572 --> 41:45.438
- What the fuck?
- I need your phone.

41:45.440 --> 41:47.440
- What for? Why?
- 'Cause there's been a murder!

41:47.442 --> 41:49.076
Oh, shit.

41:49.078 --> 41:51.744
- Um, they're not paying me.
- What?

41:51.746 --> 41:53.579
They haven't paid me
in like two months,

41:53.581 --> 41:55.681
so I don't think I should have
to, like, do anything dangerous.

41:55.683 --> 41:59.420
- I need your fucking phone!
- Calm down.

42:08.562 --> 42:10.730
The water bill
has literally tripled

42:10.732 --> 42:12.364
since you moved in here.

42:12.366 --> 42:14.500
Unbelievable.

42:16.671 --> 42:18.674
Excuse me.

42:26.381 --> 42:28.747
- Hello?
- Scott, it's Cass.

42:28.749 --> 42:30.415
Hey, Cass.
What's up?

42:30.417 --> 42:33.319
- Whose number is this?
- It's some kid's.

42:33.321 --> 42:35.154
Look, I think
something happened to Morgan.

42:35.156 --> 42:37.489
- What?
- Can you just get here? Shit.

42:37.491 --> 42:39.524
The cops are here.
I can't talk.

42:39.526 --> 42:41.259
First, tell me what happened.

42:41.261 --> 42:43.663
I need you to come to the
Los Campos de Oro subdivision.

42:43.665 --> 42:45.563
- Can you come up?
- Okay, look...

42:45.565 --> 42:47.798
I don't know where I'm gonna be,
and I don't have my cell.

42:47.800 --> 42:49.501
- Can you get here?
- Okay, look,

42:49.503 --> 42:51.836
it's rush hour,
so it's gonna take me forever.

42:51.838 --> 42:53.838
Scott, I need your help!
Please, can you come?!

42:53.840 --> 42:56.307
Just leave now!

42:56.309 --> 42:58.278
Fuck.

43:00.146 --> 43:03.115
What shit
is Queen Cassie pulling now?

43:03.117 --> 43:04.816
Something's happened to Morgan.

43:04.818 --> 43:07.686
I don't... I don't know
what's going on.

43:07.688 --> 43:10.655
I got to go.

43:10.657 --> 43:12.559
Now?

43:28.708 --> 43:30.374
- Did you call in a homicide?
- Yes.

43:30.376 --> 43:32.209
There's a man inside there.
He has my daughter.

43:32.211 --> 43:34.245
- And he's killed two people.
- So, a man has your daughter?

43:34.247 --> 43:36.147
- And he's in there now?
- Yes, I think.

43:36.149 --> 43:37.848
Do you think he has
your daughter, or do you think

43:37.850 --> 43:39.884
- he's in there now?
- Both.

43:39.886 --> 43:42.319
- Okay, this man...
- Can I have my phone back?

43:42.321 --> 43:44.621
- What?
- My phone, my iPhone.

43:44.623 --> 43:46.290
- That cost like 400 bucks.
- Yeah, here.

43:46.292 --> 43:48.228
Here's your phone.

43:49.529 --> 43:51.694
So, this man you think has
your daughter, do you know him?

43:51.696 --> 43:53.696
I don't know his name.
I know his first name is Sonny.

43:53.698 --> 43:55.799
- I don't know his last name.
- Do you know where Sonny lives?

43:55.801 --> 43:57.734
I don't know his address,
but if we drive in there,

43:57.736 --> 43:59.638
I think I can find it.

44:02.575 --> 44:03.710
Excuse me.

44:04.776 --> 44:08.478
How many exits does
this luxury experience have?

44:08.480 --> 44:10.346
This is <i>the</i> gate.

44:10.348 --> 44:11.882
It's the only way in or out

44:11.884 --> 44:14.350
unless you want to,
like, climb over a wall.

44:14.352 --> 44:15.585
Do you know
where this Sonny lives?

44:15.587 --> 44:17.321
I don't know
any of these assholes.

44:17.323 --> 44:18.388
You think any of them
know my name?

44:18.390 --> 44:20.290
Oh, my God!

44:20.292 --> 44:23.559
Would it be too much to ask for
you to check on your PC there?

44:23.561 --> 44:26.296
Okay.

44:30.869 --> 44:32.568
No, we don't have a Sonny.

44:32.570 --> 44:34.503
- Might be an alias.
- Look, he worked with my boss,

44:34.505 --> 44:36.606
so when your backup gets here,
we can look on their computer.

44:36.608 --> 44:38.640
There is no backup, ma'am.

44:38.642 --> 44:40.510
- What?
- Well, about four years ago,

44:40.512 --> 44:42.611
this was
a nice agricultural community.

44:42.613 --> 44:44.847
We weren't
even incorporated then.

44:44.849 --> 44:47.717
So, in four years
of population growth,

44:47.719 --> 44:49.285
no one thought to expand
the police force

44:49.287 --> 44:51.253
to, say, like,
two fucking people?!

44:51.255 --> 44:53.990
Do you know how long
it takes a state task force

44:53.992 --> 44:56.394
- to perform the "mandatory"...
- What are we going to do?!

44:57.229 --> 44:58.860
Well, you said you know
where the house is, right?

44:58.862 --> 45:00.296
- Yeah.
- Well, then hi-yo,

45:00.298 --> 45:01.867
motherfucking Silver.

45:09.607 --> 45:12.373
Would you put that fucking thing
in the glove compartment

45:12.375 --> 45:13.909
before somebody sees you?

45:13.911 --> 45:15.844
It's not a toy.

45:15.846 --> 45:18.616
- I thought you hated guns.
- I do.

45:19.716 --> 45:22.016
Why can't I hold it?

45:22.018 --> 45:24.652
- I, like, grew up shooting.
- Because I said so, honey.

45:24.654 --> 45:25.953
That's why.

45:25.955 --> 45:28.593
- Please?
- No.

45:29.292 --> 45:32.426
- Pretty please?
- No.

45:32.428 --> 45:34.795
- Why did you even bring it?
- I don't know.

45:34.797 --> 45:37.398
Cassie just never sounds scared
like that,

45:37.400 --> 45:41.937
so I brought it, um,
you know, just in case.

45:41.939 --> 45:45.906
Mm. In case you need to gun
some motherfucker down.

45:45.908 --> 45:49.277
In case
I need to protect my family.

45:49.279 --> 45:53.482
- My daughter.
- Mm. Okay.

45:53.484 --> 45:55.284
So, where are the bullets?

45:55.286 --> 45:56.551
- In the trunk.
- What?!

45:56.553 --> 45:57.852
- Yeah. Why?
- Seriously?

45:57.854 --> 45:59.687
- Yes.
- You know they could go off

45:59.689 --> 46:02.990
- back there if it gets too hot?
- Are you fucking serious?

46:02.992 --> 46:05.559
No.

46:05.561 --> 46:08.428
- Oh, you're such a dork.
- That's good. That's good.

46:08.430 --> 46:10.865
God help us if you actually
have to shoot somebody.

46:10.867 --> 46:12.369
Just...

46:21.977 --> 46:24.644
I-I... It's got to be
one of these streets.

46:24.646 --> 46:26.849
Go to the stop sign
and take a left.

46:32.889 --> 46:34.588
Go, go.
Please, go.

46:34.590 --> 46:36.390
And then
take a left right there.

46:36.392 --> 46:38.361
Okay.

46:39.329 --> 46:41.898
Yeah, okay. Up there.
Up there on the right.

46:42.731 --> 46:44.497
No offense.
How can you tell?

46:44.499 --> 46:47.833
- They all look identical.
- Rock lawn, tree, big rock.

46:47.835 --> 46:50.369
- That's it.
- They all got rock lawns.

46:50.371 --> 46:51.871
Yeah, but not right
on the golf course.

46:51.873 --> 46:53.340
Hey, look, I am a Realtor,

46:53.342 --> 46:54.674
and I show houses
in this neighborhood,

46:54.676 --> 46:55.811
so I know
what I'm talking about.

46:56.545 --> 46:58.545
All right.

46:58.547 --> 47:00.315
Let's go.

47:14.730 --> 47:17.366
He's got a lot of guns.

47:20.969 --> 47:23.072
So do I.

47:52.432 --> 47:54.735
You should stay back.

48:11.519 --> 48:12.517
Aah!

48:12.519 --> 48:14.051
Stay back!
Aah!

48:14.053 --> 48:16.854
Damn it!
God damn it!

48:16.856 --> 48:20.057
God damn it!
Who'd I shoot?

48:20.059 --> 48:22.460
- Who the fuck did I shoot?
- Oh, my God.

48:22.462 --> 48:24.762
- This isn't the house.
- You said it was the house.

48:24.764 --> 48:27.097
God damn it!

48:27.099 --> 48:29.000
Oh, God.

48:29.002 --> 48:31.436
You called the cops?

48:31.438 --> 48:33.603
No, no, I didn't.
I-I...

48:33.605 --> 48:35.972
- Oh, you didn't?
- I mean, I didn't mean to.

48:35.974 --> 48:38.878
Cassie, I'm not stupid, okay?
<i>You're</i> stupid.

48:39.612 --> 48:42.447
I saw you guys drive
right past my house like idiots.

48:42.449 --> 48:44.952
I mean, who even lives here?
Her?

48:45.685 --> 48:47.851
Well, look.

48:47.853 --> 48:49.820
Now you killed someone, too.

48:49.822 --> 48:51.121
It was an accident.

48:51.123 --> 48:53.824
Oh.
Welcome to the club.

48:53.826 --> 48:55.893
Where's my daughter?

48:55.895 --> 48:58.161
Well, for your information,
I brought her here

48:58.163 --> 49:00.764
so you and I
could work out a little deal.

49:00.766 --> 49:04.101
Then, like you do,
you lied to me...

49:04.103 --> 49:05.837
again!

49:05.839 --> 49:07.637
I went to your house, Cassie.

49:07.639 --> 49:10.473
- Okay. So?
- My house is nicer than yours?

49:10.475 --> 49:11.808
Fuck you!

49:11.810 --> 49:14.076
Italian ceramic tile floors?

49:14.078 --> 49:16.580
Italian fucking
ceramic tile floors?!

49:16.582 --> 49:19.683
You don't think I know how much
that fucking update costs?

49:19.685 --> 49:21.517
Aw, fuck!
My back!

49:21.519 --> 49:23.220
My back, my back.
Oh!

49:23.222 --> 49:24.921
I pulled my back out.
Crap.

49:24.923 --> 49:26.555
Oh, crap.
Oh, my God.

49:26.557 --> 49:28.491
Get back here!
Get back here!

49:28.493 --> 49:30.627
Fuck! Aah!
You stay right there.

49:30.629 --> 49:32.863
Oh! I can still end this,
motherfucker.

49:32.865 --> 49:35.098
Oh, crap!
Oh, crap.

49:35.100 --> 49:38.200
Oh, my God.
Aah. Okay.

49:38.202 --> 49:40.035
I'm so sorry
that I was mean to you.

49:40.037 --> 49:42.638
God damn it!
Aah!

49:42.640 --> 49:45.908
I really need your help, okay?

49:45.910 --> 49:48.211
Fuck.

49:48.213 --> 49:49.779
Catch them.

49:49.781 --> 49:51.281
What's this?

49:51.283 --> 49:52.649
You're driving.

49:52.651 --> 49:54.216
I want you to back that car out,

49:54.218 --> 49:56.919
park it in the street,
pull the cop car in here, okay?

49:56.921 --> 49:59.722
You can't leave it out there
in broad daylight,

49:59.724 --> 50:01.123
and I can't be getting
in and out of cars

50:01.125 --> 50:03.795
with my fucking back.
It's the worst.

50:05.161 --> 50:09.264
And if you even think about
driving out of here without me,

50:09.266 --> 50:12.300
let me just tell you
that something very, very bad

50:12.302 --> 50:14.538
is gonna happen
to your daughter, okay?

50:15.739 --> 50:18.007
How do I know you even have her?

50:18.009 --> 50:21.309
Well, is that a risk
you're willing to take?

50:24.815 --> 50:28.016
Oh, I got to get this.
It's my son.

50:28.018 --> 50:29.552
Hey, handsome!

50:29.554 --> 50:32.121
How are you, buddy?

50:32.123 --> 50:34.860
Yeah, I'm having a good day.

50:36.126 --> 50:38.864
Good, good.

50:41.632 --> 50:45.198
That's awesome, man.
That's so cool.

50:45.200 --> 50:47.704
Yeah. You have
a good day at school?

50:48.738 --> 50:50.138
Well, I told you
I'm gonna get the tickets,

50:50.140 --> 50:51.573
so, of course,
I'm gonna get them.

51:27.910 --> 51:29.243
This is unbelievable.

51:29.245 --> 51:30.978
So, tell me something...

51:30.980 --> 51:33.213
Where the fuck
are all these people going?

51:33.215 --> 51:36.316
I don't understand why we can't
just call Cassie and ask...

51:36.318 --> 51:38.918
She doesn't have a phone,
Kelsey.

51:38.920 --> 51:41.121
Okay, but who calls
somebody up and says,

51:41.123 --> 51:42.356
"Oh, there's
this big emergency,"

51:42.358 --> 51:44.256
and then doesn't give
any details?

51:44.258 --> 51:46.959
- A fucking manipulator, is who.
- See, the cops came, Kelsey.

51:46.961 --> 51:49.296
Right?
So it's obviously an emergency.

51:49.298 --> 51:52.833
- Yeah, sure.
- God.

51:52.835 --> 51:54.767
You're always defending her.
You're always defending her.

51:54.769 --> 51:57.137
She's just dragging you.
You're just fucking taking it.

51:57.139 --> 52:00.039
- She's such a bitch to you.
- She should be.

52:00.041 --> 52:02.642
I was a bad husband.

52:02.644 --> 52:05.914
Okay, but you're a good father.

52:06.648 --> 52:09.682
- I had sex with someone else.
- Oh, no. Everybody does.

52:09.684 --> 52:11.954
It's fine.
You weren't happy.

52:13.222 --> 52:15.088
No, I actually was.

52:15.090 --> 52:18.858
I just, uh, you know,
wanted something better.

52:18.860 --> 52:20.696
And now you found it.

52:22.330 --> 52:24.096
Absolutely.

52:24.098 --> 52:25.764
You kidding me?

52:25.766 --> 52:27.669
Jackpot.

52:34.308 --> 52:37.009
- Baby.
- Mom? Mom?

52:37.011 --> 52:38.844
- It's me. It's me.
- Mom?

52:38.846 --> 52:40.846
- Are you okay? Are you hurt?
- Why is this happening?

52:40.848 --> 52:42.748
Everything's gonna be fine,
okay?

52:42.750 --> 52:45.051
- Tell me why this is happening.
- Everything is gonna be okay.

52:45.053 --> 52:46.384
- I don't want you to worry.
- Tell me why.

52:46.386 --> 52:48.054
I don't want you to worry.

52:48.056 --> 52:49.922
Are you seriously not gonna
tell me what's going on?

52:49.924 --> 52:52.223
- Honey, just listen to me, okay?
- Where's Dad?

52:52.225 --> 52:54.125
He's not here.
He's not coming.

52:54.127 --> 52:55.928
- Why not?
- Because I didn't call him,

52:55.930 --> 52:57.395
because I can handle this
myself.

52:57.397 --> 53:00.098
What's your problem?
What did Dad ever do to you?

53:00.100 --> 53:03.703
Look, I don't want to talk to
you about this right now, okay?

53:03.705 --> 53:05.071
Are you fucking me?!

53:05.073 --> 53:06.705
Okay, okay.
We're not gonna do that.

53:06.707 --> 53:09.240
All right?
My back is killing me here.

53:09.242 --> 53:11.876
I got my dead ex-wife
staring at me,

53:11.878 --> 53:13.111
and I'm not gonna hear you two

53:13.113 --> 53:14.979
bicker with each other,
all right?

53:14.981 --> 53:17.381
I need everyone to be nice
to each other

53:17.383 --> 53:19.450
and shut the fuck up
until it gets dark.

53:19.452 --> 53:21.251
Okay? Aah!

53:21.253 --> 53:23.722
Aah.

53:23.724 --> 53:27.925
Then we will bury this bitch
like civilized people.

53:27.927 --> 53:29.160
Okay?

53:29.162 --> 53:31.463
Just sit here and relax.

53:31.465 --> 53:33.131
I'll put some TV on.

53:40.840 --> 53:42.842
God damn it.

53:46.345 --> 53:48.747
Okay. Okay.
We're not gonna watch TV.

53:48.749 --> 53:50.347
No one's watching TV.
Okay?

53:50.349 --> 53:52.050
We're just gonna sit here
and look at each other.

53:52.052 --> 53:54.320
How about that?

54:26.317 --> 54:29.855
Bodies are, like,
super-heavy, right?

54:30.822 --> 54:32.556
I'm sorry
I can't help y'all carry her.

54:32.558 --> 54:34.857
It's just, I can't take
the risk with my back.

54:34.859 --> 54:37.994
You know, one time,
I was in bed for eight days

54:37.996 --> 54:40.429
because I tried to tie my shoes.

54:40.431 --> 54:42.565
You never can tell
where it's gonna flare up,

54:42.567 --> 54:44.268
what it will do.

54:44.270 --> 54:46.269
Come on.
You can do it.

54:46.271 --> 54:48.204
Let's go.
Let's do this. Move.

54:48.206 --> 54:49.539
Fucking creepy out here.

54:49.541 --> 54:51.142
Not trying to be out here
all night.

54:51.910 --> 54:53.508
- Oh! Oh, Mom.
- Jesus Christ.

54:53.510 --> 54:56.178
- Are you okay?
- My knee!

54:57.981 --> 55:00.883
Well, I guess this is
as good a place as any.

55:00.885 --> 55:02.450
For what?

55:02.452 --> 55:04.153
Haven't you ever seen
a movie before?

55:04.155 --> 55:05.488
To dig a grave.

55:05.490 --> 55:08.925
- Just for her, right?
- Well, for her and Gary.

55:08.927 --> 55:10.526
The cop can stay where he's at.

55:10.528 --> 55:14.597
Unless, of course, you think
there may be more bodies.

55:14.599 --> 55:17.200
I'm kidding with you, Cassie.

55:17.202 --> 55:19.334
Come on!
You know I'm not gonna kill you.

55:19.336 --> 55:22.504
We're good again. We're fine.
My back is royally fucked.

55:22.506 --> 55:25.575
I can't be carrying dead bodies
around and burying people.

55:25.577 --> 55:27.109
I need you guys, okay?

55:27.111 --> 55:29.178
We're in this together.

55:29.180 --> 55:30.983
We're a team.

55:33.116 --> 55:36.384
Check it out.
Candle mode.

55:36.386 --> 55:38.085
Pretty cool, huh?

55:38.087 --> 55:40.487
Looks like
Vicki has a glowing penis.

55:40.489 --> 55:42.456
All right, kid. Get up.

55:42.458 --> 55:45.559
- Start digging.
- She's a child.

55:45.561 --> 55:48.929
Oh, what? Kids aren't
expected to work anymore?

55:48.931 --> 55:51.900
You know, I was 10 years old
when I had my first job. 10.

55:51.902 --> 55:54.001
She's scared.

55:54.003 --> 55:55.536
You know what?
Whatever, Mom. It's fine.

55:55.538 --> 55:58.308
See, Mom?
It's fine. Whatever.

55:59.243 --> 56:02.543
10 years old.

56:02.545 --> 56:05.179
I was doing fashion shows
for JCPenney's.

56:05.181 --> 56:07.983
- Male fashions.
- Hm.

56:07.985 --> 56:10.454
I was such a handsome boy.

56:13.257 --> 56:15.090
Do you smell that?
Is that her?

56:15.092 --> 56:18.025
Is that Vicki?
Ugh.

56:18.027 --> 56:21.127
It's crazy that bodies
start stinking so quickly.

56:21.129 --> 56:22.865
Oh.
Jesus Christ.

56:23.466 --> 56:25.531
Okay, seriously,
how long is this gonna take?

56:25.533 --> 56:27.401
I don't know.
I never dug a grave before.

56:27.403 --> 56:29.203
What, and I have?

56:29.205 --> 56:31.138
Come on, don't be a smart-ass,
Cassie. What do you think?

56:31.140 --> 56:32.473
You can make an estimate.
Can't you?

56:32.475 --> 56:35.241
I don't know.
2 hours... 20.

56:35.243 --> 56:36.977
20 hours?

56:36.979 --> 56:39.348
Cassie.
Cassie, look at me.

56:40.082 --> 56:42.216
You're gonna do it
in 30 minutes. Do you hear me?

56:42.218 --> 56:44.317
I don't care
what the fuck it takes.

56:44.319 --> 56:46.419
You're doing it.
30 minutes.

56:46.421 --> 56:48.522
Well, the only way it can
get done is by shoveling.

56:48.524 --> 56:50.591
Okay, well, then shovel more,
okay?

56:50.593 --> 56:52.692
Or faster. Or whatever the hell
it takes to get the dirt

56:52.694 --> 56:57.167
out of the fucking ground.
3-O, 30 minutes.

56:59.035 --> 57:01.303
- Police.
- Bullshit.

57:05.040 --> 57:07.508
- God damn it, Cassie!
- Come on, Morgan.

57:07.510 --> 57:09.474
What the fuck?!

57:09.476 --> 57:11.577
Ow!
Oh, my fucking back!

57:11.579 --> 57:15.081
Oh!
Oh, fuck, Cassie!

57:15.083 --> 57:17.182
I hope you knocked
his fucking teeth out.

57:17.184 --> 57:19.418
God damn it.
Aah!

57:19.420 --> 57:23.324
Cassie! I told you
I wasn't gonna kill you!

57:25.659 --> 57:27.195
Come on, baby!
Run.

57:27.728 --> 57:28.728
Cassie!

57:28.730 --> 57:32.134
Oh, fuck.
Ohh!

57:40.574 --> 57:43.378
Cassie, you can't hide!

58:00.093 --> 58:02.195
I will find you!

58:08.669 --> 58:10.335
Oh, my God.
This way.

58:10.337 --> 58:12.236
This way.

58:12.238 --> 58:13.471
This way.

58:13.473 --> 58:15.741
Fucking bitch!

58:15.743 --> 58:17.679
Here. Be careful.

58:25.419 --> 58:28.589
Mom, use this.

58:31.290 --> 58:34.495
I don't even want
to know why you have a lighter.

58:39.799 --> 58:43.402
Ow. Ow.

58:43.404 --> 58:47.137
Ow. Ow.

58:47.139 --> 58:49.472
Ow.

58:52.144 --> 58:55.246
Okay.

58:55.248 --> 58:59.749
Sewer pipe, sewer rats.

58:59.751 --> 59:01.084
Aah.

59:08.760 --> 59:10.260
Okay. Come on.

59:10.262 --> 59:12.331
Come.
Go, go, go.

59:30.182 --> 59:31.449
Okay.
Come on, come on, come on.

59:31.451 --> 59:33.051
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

59:39.723 --> 59:41.223
All right.
Try and figure it out.

59:41.225 --> 59:43.461
Up to the street we go.

59:45.797 --> 59:46.799
Cassie!

59:47.866 --> 59:52.371
I know you're down there.

59:53.605 --> 59:55.440
Okay.

01:00:12.457 --> 01:00:14.723
Dad's coming.

01:00:14.725 --> 01:00:17.726
I couldn't tell you back there,
but I called him.

01:00:17.728 --> 01:00:21.298
- Thank God.
- He's gonna find us.

01:00:22.499 --> 01:00:24.399
- Now where?
- Well, she said,

01:00:24.401 --> 01:00:26.635
"Go to one
of these developments."

01:00:26.637 --> 01:00:29.570
Oh, shit. The something.
Something Spanish.

01:00:29.572 --> 01:00:31.405
Yeah, but what do
I put in the GPS?

01:00:31.407 --> 01:00:34.142
I don't know. I don't know
how to work that fucking thing.

01:00:34.144 --> 01:00:36.778
Why are you awful?
You don't know how to work shit!

01:00:36.780 --> 01:00:38.847
Jesus!

01:00:38.849 --> 01:00:41.119
God!

01:00:45.421 --> 01:00:48.490
How you doing?

01:00:48.492 --> 01:00:50.191
I'm looking
for one of these, uh,

01:00:50.193 --> 01:00:51.727
housing developments
around here.

01:00:51.729 --> 01:00:53.461
A gated community.

01:00:53.463 --> 01:00:55.329
- Which one?
- I don't remember.

01:00:55.331 --> 01:00:57.666
That's the problem.
I know it's something Spanish.

01:00:57.668 --> 01:01:00.501
The developments
all have Mexican names

01:01:00.503 --> 01:01:02.537
and no Mexicans living in them.

01:01:02.539 --> 01:01:05.307
Okay. How many developments
do you think there are?

01:01:05.309 --> 01:01:08.808
9 or 10.
Was it something "de Oro"?

01:01:08.810 --> 01:01:11.347
Yeah. Yeah.
Exactly. De Oro.

01:01:12.181 --> 01:01:13.781
- There's five of them.
- Okay.

01:01:13.783 --> 01:01:17.451
There's Mesa Ridge de Oro,
Dominio de Oro, Pointa de Oro,

01:01:17.453 --> 01:01:20.487
Orroyo de Oro,
Los Campos de Oro.

01:01:20.489 --> 01:01:23.857
Okay. I guess they just think
it sounds fancy or something.

01:01:23.859 --> 01:01:27.396
Because what says fancy
like Mexico?

01:01:28.730 --> 01:01:30.533
Right.

01:01:58.961 --> 01:02:02.298
We should probably be
under the tennis courts by now.

01:02:16.678 --> 01:02:19.615
Okay, okay.

01:02:34.963 --> 01:02:37.430
Be ready to run.

01:02:37.432 --> 01:02:39.466
Okay?

01:02:39.468 --> 01:02:43.602
- Is he out there?
- I don't know.

01:02:43.604 --> 01:02:45.839
What are we gonna do
if he's out there?

01:03:04.859 --> 01:03:07.362
Shh, shh.
Go.

01:03:17.505 --> 01:03:18.670
<i>Great shot!</i>

01:03:18.672 --> 01:03:19.940
Huh.

01:03:22.375 --> 01:03:24.511
Come on, baby.
We're so close.

01:03:26.714 --> 01:03:28.012
We're almost there.

01:03:28.014 --> 01:03:29.581
Come on, baby.

01:03:29.583 --> 01:03:32.616
- Ow! My ankle!
- Come on, baby. Come on.

01:03:32.618 --> 01:03:33.618
Oh, come on, honey.

01:03:33.620 --> 01:03:35.053
- We're so close.
- My ankle.

01:03:35.055 --> 01:03:36.586
I know,
but we've got to keep moving.

01:03:36.588 --> 01:03:37.854
I want Dad.

01:03:37.856 --> 01:03:39.624
Look, I can get us
out of here, okay?

01:03:39.626 --> 01:03:41.426
- But you got to keep moving.
- I can't.

01:03:41.428 --> 01:03:44.796
Yes, you can. Look, this guy,
he's gonna kill us.

01:03:44.798 --> 01:03:46.830
- I want Dad.
- Stop saying that.

01:03:46.832 --> 01:03:48.665
I want Dad.

01:03:48.667 --> 01:03:51.305
What is Dad gonna do for you?

01:03:51.805 --> 01:03:55.542
I've been tricked!

01:04:02.615 --> 01:04:06.049
Seen any police here in
about the past three hours?

01:04:06.051 --> 01:04:09.323
No? No one around?
Thank you.

01:04:28.440 --> 01:04:31.077
This is it...
right here. Okay. Come on.

01:04:32.076 --> 01:04:34.346
All right, kid.

01:04:42.020 --> 01:04:43.786
Let's get the fuck out of here.

01:04:55.701 --> 01:04:57.900
Okay.
Strike two.

01:04:57.902 --> 01:05:00.005
Fuck.

01:05:01.572 --> 01:05:03.072
I think this is it.

01:05:03.074 --> 01:05:05.011
Come on, Mom.
Go faster.

01:05:13.551 --> 01:05:14.683
Aah!

01:05:14.685 --> 01:05:17.723
- You're gonna kill us!
- Shit!

01:05:37.207 --> 01:05:40.676
- Whoa!
- Shit! Get down! Stay down!

01:05:45.582 --> 01:05:48.517
- Aah!
- Yeah! Fuck, yeah!

01:05:48.519 --> 01:05:50.919
Aah! Shit!

01:05:50.921 --> 01:05:52.955
Okay.
Are you okay?

01:05:52.957 --> 01:05:54.589
- Are you okay?
- I think so.

01:05:56.193 --> 01:05:59.561
Hey. You hungry, huh?

01:05:59.563 --> 01:06:01.528
You want to get
them bunnies, huh?

01:06:01.530 --> 01:06:02.833
We got to run.

01:06:03.567 --> 01:06:06.534
- Morgan, come on!
- Wanna eat them fucking bunnies?

01:06:06.536 --> 01:06:07.936
Let's go.

01:06:07.938 --> 01:06:10.037
Assholes and elbows.

01:06:10.039 --> 01:06:11.773
Go on!

01:06:11.775 --> 01:06:13.641
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

01:06:13.643 --> 01:06:16.010
- You better run!
- Come on! Go, go!

01:06:16.012 --> 01:06:17.748
Run!

01:06:19.615 --> 01:06:21.715
No, go on!
Them!

01:06:21.717 --> 01:06:23.586
No, no, no.
Unh-unh.

01:06:24.054 --> 01:06:25.887
Unh-unh.

01:06:25.889 --> 01:06:28.255
No, fucking them!
Aah!

01:06:28.257 --> 01:06:30.057
Oh, fuck!

01:06:30.059 --> 01:06:32.593
Aah!
Get over there!

01:06:32.595 --> 01:06:34.565
Fucking asshole!

01:06:39.001 --> 01:06:41.971
Aah!

01:06:43.873 --> 01:06:46.507
Aw, fuck.

01:06:46.509 --> 01:06:47.977
Nasty.

01:06:50.578 --> 01:06:52.678
Look.

01:06:52.680 --> 01:06:54.483
There's a light.

01:07:04.759 --> 01:07:05.928
Hold it back in.

01:07:16.272 --> 01:07:18.107
Okay.

01:07:22.844 --> 01:07:24.710
- Ow! Oh!
- You okay?

01:07:24.712 --> 01:07:27.647
- Oh! I cut my hand.
- You okay?

01:07:27.649 --> 01:07:30.886
- My hand.
- Let me see.

01:07:31.854 --> 01:07:33.655
Okay.

01:07:52.941 --> 01:07:55.711
Shit.

01:07:56.811 --> 01:07:58.878
God damn it.
Fuck!

01:07:58.880 --> 01:08:01.115
Oh, shit.

01:08:05.586 --> 01:08:08.954
Welcome to, uh,
Los Campos de Oro.

01:08:08.956 --> 01:08:12.191
Jesus.
Are you okay?

01:08:12.193 --> 01:08:14.626
Uh, yeah.
Yeah, yeah.

01:08:14.628 --> 01:08:17.029
I'm doing good.
This isn't my blood.

01:08:17.031 --> 01:08:18.997
This guy
got into a car accident.

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:22.367
He, like, jumped the curb and
smashed into that transformer,

01:08:22.368 --> 01:08:25.069
and, uh...
But nobody got hurt.

01:08:25.071 --> 01:08:26.304
I mean, except for him.
He got hurt.

01:08:26.305 --> 01:08:28.037
Uh, you know, he got hurt.

01:08:28.040 --> 01:08:29.939
He broke his arm,
and, like, the bone came out.

01:08:29.942 --> 01:08:31.774
- It was pretty gross.
- Right, so, when was this?

01:08:31.777 --> 01:08:34.845
Uh, I think the ambulance left,
like, 20 minutes ago.

01:08:34.846 --> 01:08:37.113
I was actually gonna go home
and clean up and get a shower,

01:08:37.116 --> 01:08:38.216
but I got to wait
for the tow truck.

01:08:38.218 --> 01:08:39.951
So, where are the police?

01:08:39.953 --> 01:08:41.653
That's a damn good question.

01:08:41.654 --> 01:08:43.720
You know, there's only,
like, one cop in the town,

01:08:43.723 --> 01:08:45.055
so if he gets
more than two calls, he's...

01:08:45.057 --> 01:08:46.390
Okay.
That might actually be...

01:08:46.392 --> 01:08:48.893
Uh, I'm looking for my wife.

01:08:48.895 --> 01:08:51.028
- Wow.
- What?

01:08:51.029 --> 01:08:53.801
My ex-wife and my daughter.

01:08:54.334 --> 01:08:56.201
- She called you?
- Yeah.

01:08:56.203 --> 01:08:58.135
From here
or somewhere around here.

01:08:58.136 --> 01:08:59.938
She was with the cops,

01:08:59.939 --> 01:09:02.774
and this is about, you know,
like, three hours ago maybe.

01:09:02.776 --> 01:09:05.309
Well, you see, that would have
been before my shift.

01:09:05.310 --> 01:09:08.778
Okay. Well, could you maybe call
who was ever working before you?

01:09:08.779 --> 01:09:11.048
And maybe they'd have some
information that you might...

01:09:11.050 --> 01:09:12.383
That'd be impossible.

01:09:12.385 --> 01:09:14.151
I don't have
the phone number of the guy

01:09:14.153 --> 01:09:16.653
who works the shift before here
because we're enemies.

01:09:16.654 --> 01:09:19.389
We're not friends.
He slept with my wife.

01:09:19.390 --> 01:09:20.894
Ex-wife.

01:09:22.694 --> 01:09:24.127
I'll tell you what.

01:09:24.130 --> 01:09:26.330
If your ex-wife
and your daughter are in here,

01:09:26.332 --> 01:09:28.264
I'll help you find them.

01:09:28.265 --> 01:09:31.268
- Great. Thank you.
- Yeah.

01:09:31.270 --> 01:09:32.902
What kind of car is this?

01:09:32.904 --> 01:09:34.837
- It's a BMW.
- Yeah, no shit.

01:09:34.840 --> 01:09:36.042
What series?

01:09:36.876 --> 01:09:38.743
It's a 5 Series.

01:09:39.310 --> 01:09:42.747
Oh, 5, nice.

01:09:49.120 --> 01:09:51.024
- Is anybody in here?
- I don't know.

01:09:52.756 --> 01:09:54.860
Do you want anybody
to be in here?

01:10:17.415 --> 01:10:19.083
Cassie!

01:10:20.150 --> 01:10:21.819
Morgan!

01:10:22.453 --> 01:10:25.388
You're doing good!
Keep yelling!

01:10:25.390 --> 01:10:27.092
Cassie!

01:10:28.059 --> 01:10:30.129
- Morgan!
- Louder!

01:10:31.162 --> 01:10:32.227
What's going on?

01:10:32.229 --> 01:10:34.163
Get back in your house, sir.

01:10:34.165 --> 01:10:35.333
Sonny?

01:10:36.266 --> 01:10:37.432
Oh, hey.
What's up, Dave?

01:10:37.434 --> 01:10:39.235
Why are you...

01:10:39.237 --> 01:10:41.204
Are you a security guard?

01:10:41.206 --> 01:10:43.172
Well, you don't
have to judge, Dave.

01:10:43.174 --> 01:10:45.039
You get a job where you
can get a job, okay?

01:10:45.041 --> 01:10:46.741
Paycheck's a paycheck.
Am I right?

01:10:46.743 --> 01:10:48.275
Well, I guess so.

01:10:48.277 --> 01:10:50.111
We're... We're looking
for two women.

01:10:50.113 --> 01:10:52.780
Have you seen anybody
by any chance walking around?

01:10:52.782 --> 01:10:54.281
Don't talk to him.

01:10:54.283 --> 01:10:55.816
He doesn't even know what
fucking planet he's on.

01:10:55.818 --> 01:10:57.688
Just keep yelling their names.

01:10:59.255 --> 01:11:00.357
Cassie!

01:11:02.225 --> 01:11:03.695
Morgan!

01:11:09.933 --> 01:11:11.269
Phone.

01:11:15.037 --> 01:11:16.473
Cassie!

01:11:17.273 --> 01:11:18.539
Morgan!

01:11:18.541 --> 01:11:20.343
- Dad?
- Stay here!

01:11:20.911 --> 01:11:22.944
Cassie!

01:11:22.946 --> 01:11:24.812
Morgan!

01:11:24.814 --> 01:11:27.050
Are you sure that's their names?

01:11:29.085 --> 01:11:31.019
Cassie!

01:11:31.021 --> 01:11:32.188
Scott!

01:11:33.356 --> 01:11:35.789
Hit him!
Hit him!

01:11:35.791 --> 01:11:36.990
What'd she say, to hit him?

01:11:36.992 --> 01:11:38.158
Run him over!

01:11:40.929 --> 01:11:42.496
Aaah!

01:11:42.498 --> 01:11:44.030
Nailed it.

01:11:49.405 --> 01:11:51.241
Why aren't you wearing a shirt?

01:11:52.107 --> 01:11:54.507
How do you think you're
going to get away with this?

01:11:54.509 --> 01:11:57.478
Oh, come on, Cassie, how can
this get any worse for me?

01:11:57.480 --> 01:12:00.247
I mean, I can kill four people
and leave one witness

01:12:00.249 --> 01:12:02.448
to fucking identify me
to the police,

01:12:02.450 --> 01:12:04.350
or I kill seven people,

01:12:04.352 --> 01:12:06.252
and I got a fighting chance
to get to Mexico

01:12:06.254 --> 01:12:07.954
before the cops put out
an Amber Alert.

01:12:07.956 --> 01:12:10.360
You don't have to kill us.

01:12:11.893 --> 01:12:13.927
Oh, wait, my bad.
Eight people.

01:12:13.929 --> 01:12:15.132
I forgot about your daughter.

01:12:15.998 --> 01:12:18.164
Yeah, it's one, two,
three, four, five, six.

01:12:18.166 --> 01:12:20.934
Yeah. It's eight.
Look, I'm sorry, Cassie.

01:12:20.936 --> 01:12:22.602
You know I didn't want it
to end like this.

01:12:22.604 --> 01:12:26.538
Stop apologizing.
You're a bad person.

01:12:26.540 --> 01:12:30.577
Oh, I'm a bad person?
You're a bad person, Cassie.

01:12:30.579 --> 01:12:32.211
You looked at honest,
hardworking people,

01:12:32.213 --> 01:12:33.545
and you fucking lied to them.

01:12:33.547 --> 01:12:35.348
You told them that
buying these houses

01:12:35.350 --> 01:12:37.383
was going to be a good
investment, and it wasn't!

01:12:37.385 --> 01:12:39.152
You're a fucking bad person.

01:12:39.154 --> 01:12:40.353
You are not a good person!

01:12:40.355 --> 01:12:41.955
You're not a fucking
good person!

01:12:41.957 --> 01:12:43.555
- I'm a fucking great person!
- No, you're not!

01:12:43.557 --> 01:12:45.625
Yes, I am!
I fucking had a family!

01:12:45.627 --> 01:12:48.126
I bought a fucking house!
I started a business!

01:12:48.128 --> 01:12:50.028
I mean, all I wanted to do
was make it easier

01:12:50.030 --> 01:12:51.801
for people to put ice
in their wine!

01:12:56.238 --> 01:12:57.472
What the fuck?

01:12:59.106 --> 01:13:00.376
Huh.

01:13:05.881 --> 01:13:07.916
Oh, fuck, yeah!

01:13:09.449 --> 01:13:11.916
How fucking awesome!

01:13:15.622 --> 01:13:17.089
Mom?

01:13:17.091 --> 01:13:18.860
- Morgan?
- Over here.

01:13:33.573 --> 01:13:35.042
I found these.

01:13:36.476 --> 01:13:38.143
I know I don't always
tell you the truth,

01:13:38.145 --> 01:13:41.079
but I'm going to tell you
the truth right now, okay?

01:13:41.081 --> 01:13:43.051
You are a great fucking kid.

01:13:44.484 --> 01:13:45.987
Thanks, Mom.

01:13:55.162 --> 01:13:57.297
Fucking criminals.

01:14:14.680 --> 01:14:16.884
Cassie.

01:14:20.519 --> 01:14:23.256
Cassie, I know you're in here.

01:14:24.523 --> 01:14:26.425
Come out.

01:14:34.399 --> 01:14:36.569
Cassie.

01:15:00.025 --> 01:15:02.361
Come on, Cassie.

01:15:07.132 --> 01:15:08.934
This is starting to get old.

01:15:10.768 --> 01:15:14.272
This is starting
to get real fucking old.

01:15:26.617 --> 01:15:28.454
Jesus.

01:15:34.357 --> 01:15:36.093
Cassie.

01:15:37.695 --> 01:15:39.761
I killed your ex-husband.

01:15:39.763 --> 01:15:41.399
You're welcome.

01:15:48.739 --> 01:15:51.009
Come on, Cassie.

01:15:51.808 --> 01:15:53.344
I'm gonna find you.

01:16:35.150 --> 01:16:36.386
Oopsie.

01:16:39.556 --> 01:16:42.659
Eeny, meeny, miny...

01:16:43.426 --> 01:16:44.558
Fuck it.

01:16:44.560 --> 01:16:46.693
Ah! Ah!

01:16:49.199 --> 01:16:51.468
Aah!

01:16:52.534 --> 01:16:54.102
Fucker!

01:17:05.515 --> 01:17:06.682
Fuck!

01:17:31.672 --> 01:17:33.906
Ah!

01:17:33.908 --> 01:17:35.407
Mom!

01:17:42.150 --> 01:17:44.217
Cassie, help!

01:17:44.219 --> 01:17:45.288
Help!

01:17:47.221 --> 01:17:48.388
Help.

01:17:48.390 --> 01:17:49.822
Fuck you!

01:17:49.824 --> 01:17:51.790
- Ah!
- Aaaah!
