WEBVTT

00:03.903 --> 00:05.268
Have mercy.

00:11.544 --> 00:13.102
What's that, Jody?

00:13.179 --> 00:15.511
Yeah, you can pick me up at 8:00, baby.

00:16.248 --> 00:18.410
Yes, lord. Your red tube top.

00:19.886 --> 00:21.945
Asking out magazines, Will?

00:22.255 --> 00:25.588
I don't know.
Even paper products have some standards.

00:25.892 --> 00:29.350
What's that, Jody?
No, that's as tall as he'll ever be.

00:31.331 --> 00:33.993
Hilary, you know
I don't like wearing costumes.

00:34.067 --> 00:37.127
But, Dad, I'm coming to Hilary's party
as a ballerina.

00:37.203 --> 00:40.639
That's the one thing I wanted to come as.
And it's taken?

00:40.707 --> 00:42.004
So sorry.

00:42.909 --> 00:46.743
Please, Daddy, I want my Halloween party
to turn out really good.

00:46.813 --> 00:50.146
Couldn't you wear
a very tailored clown suit or something?

00:51.117 --> 00:54.848
Go on, Uncle Phil. You just throw
a hairpiece on and come as Mr. T.

00:55.989 --> 00:58.048
Yeah, Dad. We're all wearing costumes.

00:58.124 --> 01:01.491
I have some bad news for both of you.
You're not invited.

01:02.362 --> 01:03.351
Why not?

01:03.430 --> 01:06.922
Every time I have a party, you spend
all night hitting on my girlfriends.

01:07.000 --> 01:10.333
Wait a minute, Hilary.
Everyone in the family is invited.

01:10.403 --> 01:13.031
Besides, I'm sure Carlton and Will
have dates.

01:13.273 --> 01:16.242
- Yeah, of course.
- Oodles.

01:18.111 --> 01:20.409
I guess all things are possible.

01:21.081 --> 01:22.673
We better get going.

01:22.749 --> 01:26.048
I need to get my costume
and the mall closes in eight hours.

01:26.653 --> 01:28.644
We all need costumes. Let's go.

01:28.721 --> 01:30.882
- Won't this be fun?
- No.

01:31.758 --> 01:35.285
Come on, Philip.
Get in the Halloween spirit.

01:38.231 --> 01:42.429
So, what's that, Carlton?
You do not have a date for tonight.

01:42.702 --> 01:46.604
Like you do? Who are you taking, Page 42?

01:47.807 --> 01:51.709
Carlton, all I have to do is walk in a mall,
and I get any girl I want.

01:51.778 --> 01:53.336
It's the law of nature.

01:53.413 --> 01:56.041
It's called the survival of the handsomest.

01:56.182 --> 01:58.548
Will, I don't even have to step
into the mall.

01:58.618 --> 02:02.247
Girls surround me in the parking lot
and rip the doors off my car.

02:04.324 --> 02:07.225
Would you like to put your money
where your mouth is?

02:07.527 --> 02:09.119
A betting man.

02:09.596 --> 02:12.292
I bet you that I get a date...

02:12.966 --> 02:14.399
and you don't.

02:15.034 --> 02:16.763
This is a sucker bet, Will.

02:16.836 --> 02:20.772
Within an hour, I'll have a gorgeous date
and a great Halloween costume.

02:20.840 --> 02:22.967
You better buy the mask first.

02:24.000 --> 02:30.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:33.146 --> 03:35.808
Okay, we'll meet back at the car at 5:00.

03:35.982 --> 03:38.815
And, Carlton and Will, good luck.

03:44.791 --> 03:47.988
All right, Will.
Let the great pick-up contest begin.

03:48.528 --> 03:51.292
Carlton, this is gonna be
about as much of a contest...

03:51.364 --> 03:53.491
as Mike Tyson versus Fred Savage.

03:55.235 --> 03:58.136
Welcome to Croissants Aplenty.
I'm Cindy, your waitress.

03:58.204 --> 04:01.696
What's up, Cindy?
I'm Will and this is Carlton, my geek.

04:02.976 --> 04:05.206
Cindy, we need a woman's point of view.

04:05.278 --> 04:08.213
Which one of us
do you find more attractive?

04:10.683 --> 04:12.241
May I take your order?

04:13.286 --> 04:16.584
I'll have the goat cheese
and the prosciutto croissant.

04:17.457 --> 04:19.152
Y'all got any ribs?

04:20.660 --> 04:22.321
Okay, back to the bet.

04:22.395 --> 04:26.889
A "date" is defined as a female who
arrives at the party by midnight tonight.

04:27.400 --> 04:30.233
And let me clarify something
for you, Carlton:

04:30.303 --> 04:32.271
She has to be a human being.

04:32.905 --> 04:35.066
I saw you looking in the pet store.

04:37.243 --> 04:41.304
Hilary, I really don't think this store's
gonna have my ballerina costume.

04:41.381 --> 04:45.442
Ashley, you don't want to come to
my Halloween party as a boring ballerina.

04:45.518 --> 04:48.282
But, Hilary, I want to come
in something pretty.

04:50.723 --> 04:52.748
There. You're Charlie Chaplin.

04:52.825 --> 04:56.352
- Who is Charlie Chaplin?
- He was a silent movie star.

04:56.729 --> 04:58.959
So take a hint. Let's get my outfits.

04:59.032 --> 05:01.796
"Outfits"? How many costumes
do you need?

05:01.868 --> 05:04.632
At least five. I'm going as a runway model.

05:15.248 --> 05:18.046
- Anything I can help you with, sir?
- No, I'm just browsing.

05:18.117 --> 05:21.018
Actually, I'm supposed to be shopping
for a Halloween costume.

05:21.087 --> 05:24.420
What's this? It's one of those things
for finding your lost keys?

05:24.490 --> 05:28.893
Yes, but this one is totally new.
Are you constantly misplacing your keys?

05:30.129 --> 05:34.623
Just touch the button on the locator unit,
and the keyring emits a gentle beep tone...

05:34.701 --> 05:37.898
- to alert you to the whereabouts.
- Nice, but what's new about that?

05:37.970 --> 05:41.030
Suppose you misplace
your primary locator unit.

05:41.107 --> 05:43.371
Just use the equally handsome
secondary unit...

05:43.443 --> 05:46.810
and listen for the primary unit's
own distinctive warbling.

05:48.081 --> 05:49.844
That's a great idea.

05:50.116 --> 05:53.279
- What's this?
- It's a Dynatronics audio habitat enhancer.

05:53.353 --> 05:55.878
I could use one of those. What does it do?

05:55.955 --> 05:59.982
It produces a pleasant ocean sound,
drowning out unpleasant noise pollution.

06:00.059 --> 06:02.425
- You have that problem in your house?
- Boy, do I!

06:02.495 --> 06:05.020
My wife's nephew.
The first week he moved in with us...

06:05.098 --> 06:07.498
there was nonstop drumming
in the house.

06:10.770 --> 06:12.260
Ashley, honey...

06:14.207 --> 06:16.004
where is your violin?

06:16.509 --> 06:19.273
- Big Sal has it.
- Big Sal?

06:19.345 --> 06:22.212
He owns this great store
where you don't need any money.

06:22.281 --> 06:25.512
You just go in and give him something
you don't even want anymore...

06:25.585 --> 06:28.520
- and he gives you this ticket. Then...
- A pawnshop?

06:30.456 --> 06:34.893
- You took her to a pawnshop?
- Yeah, it was really hard, too.

06:34.961 --> 06:38.397
You don't have many pawnshops
in Bel-Air. That's really a shame.

06:38.464 --> 06:42.628
- I had to go all the way to East LA.
- East LA?

06:45.471 --> 06:49.237
- They gave me a great deal.
- They gave you a set of drums.

06:49.942 --> 06:51.500
And...

06:52.612 --> 06:55.843
I made them throw in a little gift
for each of you. Close your eyes.

06:55.915 --> 06:57.940
- Vivian!
- I want my present.

07:00.887 --> 07:02.252
Okay, open.

07:03.423 --> 07:06.449
What a lovely antique necklace.

07:12.398 --> 07:15.834
- What is this?
- Daddy, it's a diamond.

07:16.402 --> 07:17.801
No, it isn't.

07:19.372 --> 07:21.533
- You don't like it?
- No, I do not.

07:22.408 --> 07:23.898
Can I have it?

07:26.712 --> 07:29.237
How dare you pawn her violin!

07:29.315 --> 07:33.046
- She don't even like playing it no more.
- She will learn to like it later.

07:33.119 --> 07:36.680
A young woman who can play a violin
is an accomplished young lady.

07:36.756 --> 07:39.919
A girlie that can play the drums
can write her own ticket.

07:41.994 --> 07:45.293
Will, I want the best for Ashley.

07:46.365 --> 07:50.597
When I was a kid, I loved classical music,
but my parents couldn't afford lessons.

07:50.670 --> 07:53.503
I used to stand out in the parking lot
of the Philharmonic...

07:53.573 --> 07:56.474
hoping to catch a spare note
on the night air.

07:56.542 --> 07:59.375
Philip, when I met you,
you were into James Brown.

08:01.581 --> 08:05.039
- He liked James Brown?
- He even wore his hair like him.

08:05.918 --> 08:07.215
He had hair?

08:13.526 --> 08:17.360
You know, it is possible to like
both classical music and James Brown.

08:17.430 --> 08:21.628
I could not agree more. So let's
let Ashley play whatever she wants.

08:21.701 --> 08:23.794
She spent an entire year on the violin.

08:23.870 --> 08:26.634
So if she wants to try something new,
let her.

08:26.706 --> 08:28.537
You tell him, Aunt Viv.

08:28.741 --> 08:31.335
- And as for you, young man...
- Love you.

08:41.120 --> 08:44.681
The next time
you decide to visit a pawnshop, don't.

08:45.358 --> 08:47.383
- Are we clear on that?
- Yes.

08:49.862 --> 08:53.525
Master William,
there is a young gentleman downstairs...

08:53.599 --> 08:57.399
with a rather large radio
who is here to see you.

08:57.470 --> 09:01.065
- He claims his name is Jazz.
- Yo, word up. Send him up.

09:01.307 --> 09:05.368
- Now, who is this Jazz fellow?
- I heard the boy at a club.

09:05.444 --> 09:08.208
He was all of that.
He will be Ashley's new music teacher.

09:08.281 --> 09:09.805
Mr. Jazz.

09:18.157 --> 09:20.318
It's nice to meet you, Jazz.

09:20.693 --> 09:22.752
How do you do? I'm Mr. Banks.

09:22.828 --> 09:24.489
You got that right.

09:25.331 --> 09:28.095
Man, you're loaded!

09:29.502 --> 09:30.992
Yo, what's up, J.?

09:34.273 --> 09:36.241
Come on, let's just leave them alone.

09:36.309 --> 09:39.745
- I asked him to take her to her lesson...
- I know, baby.

09:40.546 --> 09:42.207
Tell Mama all about it.

09:44.150 --> 09:47.119
Ash, how about letting Jazz get busy
one time?

10:34.100 --> 10:37.536
Excuse me, I'm looking for that store
with the safari clothes.

10:37.603 --> 10:40.902
I can't remember the name,
but I think there's some produce in it.

10:40.973 --> 10:43.601
- Banana Republic.
- That's it. Thank you.

10:43.676 --> 10:48.340
You have a beautiful speaking voice.
You're probably a dynamite singer.

10:48.848 --> 10:50.338
Well, I'm okay.

10:50.683 --> 10:54.016
You want to record your own song? $8.95.

10:54.920 --> 10:57.150
I really have to shop
for a Halloween costume.

10:57.223 --> 11:00.556
That's too bad,
because you're the first person I've met...

11:00.626 --> 11:03.959
who I think could make
a professional, quality recording.

11:22.581 --> 11:25.072
- Hi, may I help you?
- I think so.

11:25.584 --> 11:27.848
You look like a woman with good taste.

11:27.920 --> 11:30.286
Tonight is my sister's Halloween party...

11:30.356 --> 11:33.189
and I was wondering
if you can honor me by...

11:34.360 --> 11:36.260
showing me that pen.

11:36.829 --> 11:39.696
Certainly. This pen was manufactured
in France.

11:39.765 --> 11:43.826
It has a 14-karat gold nib
and it's hand-lacquered. The price is...

11:43.903 --> 11:48.135
Do I look like the kind of man
who would quibble about a few dollars?

11:49.442 --> 11:51.000
That's very nice...

11:51.544 --> 11:55.674
because most of my customers would be
shocked at a pen that costs $300.

12:17.036 --> 12:18.833
Aren't these dancers great?

12:19.505 --> 12:20.802
You like dancers?

12:20.873 --> 12:23.740
I think dancers are the sexiest guys
in the whole world.

12:23.809 --> 12:26.107
Word? Yo, baby, peep this.

12:48.768 --> 12:51.032
Hi, Shauna. I'd like to try these on.

12:51.103 --> 12:53.833
Hilary, hi. I didn't even see you come in.

12:55.341 --> 12:57.935
I was just getting my overview
of your new stock.

12:58.010 --> 13:01.912
- It is all wonderful.
- Wait till you see what I've held for you.

13:03.015 --> 13:04.710
Thank you!

13:04.784 --> 13:09.483
It is so important to have friends in retail.
I've tried to explain that to my little sister.

13:09.555 --> 13:12.752
Hilary, I'd love to meet her.
When are you gonna bring her in?

13:12.825 --> 13:14.486
She's right here.

13:16.996 --> 13:19.521
- Ashley, say hi to Shauna.
- Hello.

13:20.199 --> 13:23.635
Anyway, I need some outfits
for my Halloween party tonight.

13:23.702 --> 13:25.135
That should be fun.

13:25.204 --> 13:27.672
As long as my cousin Will doesn't ruin it.

13:27.740 --> 13:30.937
You should have seen what he did
at our last party.

13:44.456 --> 13:45.821
Oh, my God!

13:46.458 --> 13:48.653
Philip, don't make a big thing out of it.

13:48.727 --> 13:52.185
If this is how he feels comfortable,
he's not killing anybody.

13:53.866 --> 13:57.427
Philip, aren't you going to introduce Will?
Introduce him.

13:58.304 --> 14:00.272
Steve, David, Henry...

14:00.739 --> 14:03.105
this is Will, my nephew by marriage.

14:09.348 --> 14:13.978
Will, these are my partners
in the law firm of Furth, Winn & Meyer.

14:14.053 --> 14:17.284
Earth, Wind & Fire.
When's your next album coming out?

14:18.524 --> 14:21.118
Will is going to go to Bel-Air Academy
with Carlton.

14:21.861 --> 14:25.695
Good for you, Will.
I used to fence at Bel-Air.

14:25.865 --> 14:29.198
Really? How much do you think
we could get for that stereo?

14:33.339 --> 14:37.002
- These hors d'oeuvres look tempting.
- Don't mind if I do.

15:00.733 --> 15:05.466
- Will, there are other people at this table.
- You're right.

15:06.505 --> 15:07.995
Any requests?

15:11.443 --> 15:15.072
- Sweetie, would you say grace, please?
- Yes, Mommy.

15:18.484 --> 15:20.782
"Hey, there, Lord
My name is Ashley Banks

15:20.853 --> 15:23.253
"My family and friends
Want to give you some thanks

15:23.322 --> 15:25.790
"So before this dinner's
All swallowed and chewed

15:25.858 --> 15:28.292
"Thank you, God, for this stupid food"

15:41.373 --> 15:45.503
The easy-to-read digital display
keeps constant track of your pencil supply.

15:45.577 --> 15:49.479
As you remove the pencils
from the sturdy ABS plastic container...

15:49.548 --> 15:53.541
the powerful micro-computer brain
continuously updates the LED read-out...

15:53.619 --> 15:56.679
and when the number reaches
your preset re-supply level...

15:56.855 --> 15:59.085
the pencil monitor alerts you
to the shortage...

15:59.158 --> 16:00.819
and reminds you to take action.

16:00.893 --> 16:05.057
<i>Only three pencils remain.
Proceed to stationery store immediately.</i>

16:05.731 --> 16:07.062
I'll take it.

16:07.533 --> 16:11.299
I better get moving. I'm sure my wife
has picked out her costume by now.

18:40.385 --> 18:41.409
Boys...

18:41.487 --> 18:44.081
I'd love to go
to the Halloween party tonight...

18:44.156 --> 18:46.283
but I can only go with one of you.

18:46.859 --> 18:49.453
Okay. Tough luck, Carlton.

18:49.528 --> 18:53.862
<i>Beat it, see you, scram, sayonara,
peace out. And so long, screwy.</i>

18:54.466 --> 18:57.731
Not so fast. I don't even know you.

18:58.303 --> 19:00.134
Count your blessings.

19:00.939 --> 19:05.000
Now do you see, miss? This is an example
of the difference between the two of us.

19:05.144 --> 19:08.978
While Carlton snaps at every opportunity
to take a cheap shot...

19:09.481 --> 19:12.575
I'm the kindest, gentlest soul
you'll ever want to meet.

19:13.819 --> 19:16.754
Melinda, I'm nice to all people.
Young and old.

19:17.022 --> 19:19.616
A couple weeks ago,
Carlton's grandmother visited.

19:19.691 --> 19:22.854
Who kept her company? Not Carlton.

19:23.896 --> 19:24.920
Me.

19:44.049 --> 19:46.040
It's 3:00 in the morning, Will.

19:49.054 --> 19:51.488
- How did you see me?
- Mama knows.

19:53.325 --> 19:58.058
Look, Granny, please don't tell Uncle Phil.
I'm just a little bit past my curfew.

19:59.298 --> 20:00.925
How much is a little?

20:00.999 --> 20:04.435
Let's just say I went out
after I was supposed to be in.

20:07.706 --> 20:11.642
- Don't do it again.
- All right. What are you doing up so late?

20:11.710 --> 20:14.201
Child, I had to get up
and get breakfast started.

20:14.980 --> 20:17.574
I don't know what you all got
that Geoffrey for.

20:19.451 --> 20:22.477
- Five-card draw?
- Yeah, I'm with it.

20:22.554 --> 20:26.854
Granny, I really like you. You and Grandpa,
you have fun. You tell jokes.

20:26.925 --> 20:30.588
- You all bust me up.
- Thank you, son.

20:31.296 --> 20:35.096
Hey, look, Granny, it's late,
everybody's asleep.

20:35.234 --> 20:38.431
You can level with me.
Uncle Phil's adopted, right?

20:41.106 --> 20:44.337
Now, we're real proud of Zeke.

20:44.910 --> 20:49.574
Did you know he won The Young Farmers
of America Pig Raising trophy?

20:51.183 --> 20:55.415
No. I didn't know that, but I'd love
to have some details about that.

20:55.988 --> 21:00.254
Won it four years running.
They had to retire his slop bucket.

21:01.393 --> 21:04.294
Slop bucket? I can't wait till he wakes up.

21:06.732 --> 21:08.723
Respect your elders, son.

21:10.035 --> 21:11.627
See, I beat you.

21:17.476 --> 21:21.503
You know, he was the first
Black President of the Young Farmers.

21:22.080 --> 21:26.141
- Was that like a big thing?
- Oh, my, yes!

21:27.686 --> 21:29.153
I beat you again.

21:35.594 --> 21:38.995
That was awfully sweet of you
to play cards with her.

21:39.331 --> 21:42.528
Sweet? Well, some would say that, but...

21:42.668 --> 21:45.068
it was just me being my thoughtful self.

21:45.404 --> 21:49.272
Reality check. This guy
is far from thoughtful.

21:49.341 --> 21:52.640
He's the most selfish, irresponsible person
I have ever met.

21:52.878 --> 21:57.212
A few weeks ago, I went on a car trip,
and this guy caused all kinds of trouble.

22:17.035 --> 22:18.559
Plans for Palm Springs.

22:18.637 --> 22:20.935
One: Work on golf swing.

22:21.006 --> 22:23.736
Two: Review SAT practice book.

22:23.875 --> 22:27.743
Three: Ask Mr. Furth
about a summer internship.

22:27.813 --> 22:30.077
Four: Get the stick out of your butt!

22:36.621 --> 22:39.681
Way to go, Will.
You almost made us crash.

22:39.958 --> 22:42.324
What are you think
you're doing here anyway?

22:42.394 --> 22:45.261
Come on. Just relax.
Pretend I'm not even here.

22:45.330 --> 22:46.524
Gladly.

22:48.734 --> 22:50.133
What you eating?

22:50.869 --> 22:52.530
For crying out loud.

22:52.671 --> 22:54.161
Can I have some?

22:55.474 --> 22:56.907
All right, Will.

22:56.975 --> 22:59.102
I'll share my snack with you
on one condition.

22:59.177 --> 23:02.442
When we get to Palm Springs,
you'll behave like a proper gentleman...

23:02.514 --> 23:05.381
and try to maintain
some sense of decorum and etiquette.

23:05.450 --> 23:07.543
- Understood?
- Yeah.

23:07.753 --> 23:10.051
Good. What do you say to an Oreo?

23:10.622 --> 23:12.817
I say, "What's up, Carlton?"

23:16.795 --> 23:18.763
He hid in the back seat?

23:19.197 --> 23:20.391
It got worse.

23:20.465 --> 23:23.696
Because of his antics,
we got arrested and thrown in jail.

23:24.403 --> 23:27.133
He's only telling
one side of the story, Melinda.

23:27.239 --> 23:29.605
When we were in jail, this boy cracked.

23:29.674 --> 23:33.166
I had to do everything in my power
to try to hold him together.

23:36.748 --> 23:39.376
This is terrible. I'm ruined.

23:39.584 --> 23:42.815
I'll be kicked out of the glee club,
I won't get into Princeton.

23:42.888 --> 23:44.788
I won't be admitted to the bar.

23:44.856 --> 23:47.689
Neither will I. The cops took my fake ID.

23:49.928 --> 23:53.295
Come on, man, don't give me
that my-dog-is-dead face.

23:53.532 --> 23:56.194
- Come on. Let's sing.
- I'm not singing.

24:04.943 --> 24:06.808
This is just retarded.

24:07.846 --> 24:10.474
Come on, man, let it go. You'll feel better.

25:22.888 --> 25:27.188
Melinda, I've been charitable so far,
but now's the time to take off the gloves.

25:27.259 --> 25:29.523
You don't know
what a date with Will is like.

25:29.594 --> 25:33.360
One evening, not so long ago,
Will was walking a young lady home...

25:35.934 --> 25:39.563
Yo, I told you, babe.
A date with me is a night to remember.

25:39.638 --> 25:41.003
What'd you think of dinner?

25:41.072 --> 25:43.336
Dinner? It was just a Slurpee.

25:44.743 --> 25:46.506
I did that for you, baby.

25:46.578 --> 25:50.036
Keep that body of yours slim, trim,
and ready for action.

25:51.416 --> 25:54.214
Well, your hamburger and fries
sure did look good.

25:55.020 --> 25:57.318
Baby, that's man food.

25:59.057 --> 26:02.618
It's getting awfully late, Will.
Shouldn't we take a cab?

26:03.194 --> 26:07.995
Well, that's awfully expensive, baby.
Let's just walk down this dark alley.

26:11.703 --> 26:15.639
All right, punk.
Your money or your girlfriend.

26:16.808 --> 26:19.743
- My brother, you're making this too easy.
- Will!

26:20.245 --> 26:21.371
Unhand her.

26:24.516 --> 26:26.416
And who are you?

26:29.721 --> 26:33.122
Banks. Carlton Banks.

26:53.712 --> 26:55.771
One second, Melinda, please.

27:03.054 --> 27:06.615
Carlton, what the hell was that?
That never happened.

27:06.691 --> 27:09.751
It could have.
Besides, when we made this bet...

27:09.828 --> 27:12.797
there was nothing in the rules
that said no lying.

27:13.498 --> 27:15.989
Well, you know,
two can play at that game.

27:18.336 --> 27:20.361
Hey. What were you two talking about?

27:20.438 --> 27:23.874
I was just asking Carlton how long
he's been a pathological liar.

27:23.942 --> 27:26.809
And he said ever since
he was the Emperor of China.

27:27.045 --> 27:30.242
- You mean, the story wasn't true?
- Of course not.

27:30.448 --> 27:33.713
I'll tell you what a typical night
with me is like.

27:37.889 --> 27:40.255
Master William, you have a visitor.

27:41.092 --> 27:42.992
A Mr. Jackson.

27:43.695 --> 27:46.220
Come on, G. I don't have time
for these interruptions.

27:46.297 --> 27:47.787
I got homework forever.

27:47.866 --> 27:50.994
Tell Michael I'll have
to work on his dance steps later.

27:51.936 --> 27:53.460
That's Bo Jackson.

27:57.409 --> 27:59.206
Yo, what's up, babe?

27:59.277 --> 28:02.644
Watch the handshake, man.
There goes baseball season.

28:02.847 --> 28:05.145
My fault. What you need, man?

28:05.216 --> 28:07.650
I'm throwing this formal dinner party...

28:07.719 --> 28:10.051
and Bo don't know what to serve.

28:10.889 --> 28:13.790
No problem. Let me hook you up
with my resident fun expert.

28:13.858 --> 28:16.190
- Hey, yo, Heav.
- You rang?

28:20.098 --> 28:21.963
Bo Jackson, Heavy D.

28:22.033 --> 28:23.967
- Yo.
- Yo, Bo.

28:24.202 --> 28:25.829
Tell Heav your problem.

28:25.904 --> 28:27.769
I'm throwing this formal dinner party.

28:27.839 --> 28:30.933
And when it comes to cooking,
Bo don't know diddley.

28:32.377 --> 28:35.574
I think that's pronounced diddley, diddley.

28:39.751 --> 28:41.616
Heav, show Bo around the kitchen.

28:41.686 --> 28:44.655
No problem.
Follow me, your running backness.

28:47.358 --> 28:50.350
Thanks so much for letting me
be your close and personal friend.

28:50.428 --> 28:52.089
Back at you, babe.

28:56.401 --> 28:57.459
Hello.

28:57.535 --> 29:00.470
Hey, Will, what's up? This is Malcolm.

29:00.538 --> 29:02.267
Yo! What up, home?

29:02.607 --> 29:04.632
I'm going on this date tonight.

29:04.709 --> 29:08.304
And I really want to impress this girl,
and I was wondering if...

29:08.546 --> 29:10.844
maybe I could tell her I know you?

29:12.350 --> 29:14.181
Malcolm.

29:15.320 --> 29:17.652
Look, I understand your instinct...

29:17.722 --> 29:20.714
but you shouldn't try to impress a girl
with who you know.

29:20.792 --> 29:23.761
It's much better that she like you
just for yourself.

29:23.828 --> 29:28.424
If she gets to know the Malcolm I know,
I don't think she'll be able to resist.

29:28.967 --> 29:30.594
Thanks a lot, Will.

29:31.202 --> 29:35.536
I don't know what I would do
without you as a close, personal friend.

29:35.607 --> 29:37.939
- Peace, man.
- Hey, peace, babe.

29:41.079 --> 29:44.071
Master William, you have another visitor.

29:44.182 --> 29:47.117
Come on, G, please.
I got to get my homework done.

29:48.219 --> 29:50.744
Terribly sorry, sir,
but he's otherwise engaged.

29:50.822 --> 29:54.019
But I happen to be his close,
personal friend.

29:58.563 --> 30:01.191
Will, I got a serious problem.

30:01.299 --> 30:04.291
Tonight I'm supposed to go in the studio
and finish up a record.

30:04.369 --> 30:05.927
I can't find the lead singer.

30:06.004 --> 30:09.064
This is real important to me.
I need your help this time, man.

30:09.140 --> 30:12.007
First of all, let's check our ego at the door.

30:13.678 --> 30:15.976
- Q, I saved your butt before.
- I know.

30:16.047 --> 30:18.106
<i>That Thriller thing.</i>

30:19.017 --> 30:23.351
Q, as always, you need a singer,
I'll get you a singer, man.

30:28.593 --> 30:30.527
Yo, what's up, man? This is Prince.

30:30.595 --> 30:32.392
I got Quincy Jones over here.

30:32.463 --> 30:33.794
Dude is in pain.

30:35.500 --> 30:37.331
Could you come right over?

30:37.402 --> 30:39.097
All right. In a minute, babe.

30:39.170 --> 30:41.934
- Who was that?
- Oh, a close, personal friend.

30:42.307 --> 30:43.968
Mr. Al B. Sure.

30:48.813 --> 30:50.508
- What's going on, man?
- Yo, what's up?

30:50.582 --> 30:52.812
I'm glad you could come
on such short notice.

30:52.884 --> 30:55.375
- I need a big favor.
- Anything for you.

30:55.820 --> 30:57.651
- Quincy Jones, Al B. Sure.
- AI B.

30:57.722 --> 30:59.917
Hey, Quincy Jones. What's happening?

31:00.758 --> 31:03.625
- Yo, y'all get to work on that track.
- Let's do it.

31:03.895 --> 31:06.989
<i>Will, 8:30, I've got to see
A Different World. I'm sorry.</i>

31:07.065 --> 31:09.192
Yeah, man. I love that show.

31:09.400 --> 31:10.389
Really?

31:10.668 --> 31:13.501
- Hey, yo, K.
- What?

31:14.806 --> 31:16.467
What's happening, babe?

31:17.075 --> 31:20.169
I want you to meet
a couple of close, personal friends of mine.

31:20.245 --> 31:23.271
Quincy Jones, Al B. Sure.
Kadeem Hardison.

31:23.581 --> 31:25.879
Man, this dude knows everybody.

31:26.351 --> 31:28.012
- How'd you guys meet?
- How'd we meet?

31:28.086 --> 31:31.647
I'm a big Giants fan
and Will is a big Philadelphia Eagles fan.

31:31.723 --> 31:34.954
It was the biggest game of the season.
The Giants were up by five.

31:35.026 --> 31:38.427
Randall Cunningham had been knocked
out of the game by Lawrence Taylor.

31:38.496 --> 31:40.964
The Eagles were desperate.
They had nowhere to go.

31:41.032 --> 31:43.933
They knew that there was
only one man in Philadelphia...

31:44.035 --> 31:46.469
to be called on in this situation.

31:46.537 --> 31:48.437
They looked at the stands.

31:48.506 --> 31:50.599
There he stood: Will Smith.

31:50.675 --> 31:52.973
He came down, got in the game...

31:53.044 --> 31:56.138
threw a 72-yard touchdown pass
to himself...

31:57.382 --> 31:58.849
in street clothes.

31:59.484 --> 32:02.647
When the game was over,
the crazy crowd mobbed and pulled him...

32:02.720 --> 32:04.813
they ripped him, pulled him.
He broke away.

32:04.889 --> 32:07.983
He ran and gave the game ball
to this little kid...

32:08.059 --> 32:10.789
standing on the sideline
with tears in his eyes.

32:10.862 --> 32:12.796
That little kid was me.

32:16.434 --> 32:18.368
- I love you.
- I love you, man!

32:19.337 --> 32:21.032
- Straight up, man!
- I know.

32:21.105 --> 32:22.470
All right, chill.

32:24.676 --> 32:26.109
You know, fellas...

32:26.411 --> 32:27.844
straight-up.

32:27.912 --> 32:30.506
- I feel a lot of love in this room.
- Yes, brother.

32:30.615 --> 32:33.584
And I just want to say I feel real happy...

32:33.651 --> 32:36.677
to have such good, close personal friends
as you guys.

32:36.754 --> 32:39.052
We're lucky to know you, too.

32:40.024 --> 32:42.356
Come on, y'all, let's sing. Here.

33:01.813 --> 33:05.010
Yeah, that was a kind of slow night for me.

33:05.083 --> 33:06.641
So come on, what's up?

33:06.718 --> 33:09.653
- Come to the party with me.
- No, come to the party with me.

33:09.721 --> 33:14.158
Guys, you have both made
such good cases for yourself...

33:14.225 --> 33:16.420
it makes it even harder to choose.

33:17.195 --> 33:21.188
So, I'm going to have to go with basic...

33:22.100 --> 33:25.627
raw, physical attraction.

33:26.704 --> 33:29.104
What time should I be there, Carlton?

33:38.516 --> 33:40.006
Excuse me.

33:41.386 --> 33:43.047
Let me see that hat.

33:43.121 --> 33:46.352
Okay, but I don't think
it works with that outfit.

33:48.226 --> 33:51.525
- Did you pay for this?
- No, I guess I forgot to.

33:52.730 --> 33:54.288
But you just had to have to it?

33:54.365 --> 33:58.495
Me? You've got to be kidding.
Derbies went out six months ago.

33:59.604 --> 34:01.936
Let's take a little walk
to the security office.

34:02.006 --> 34:04.998
You can give me
your fashion dos and don'ts there.

34:05.843 --> 34:08.539
I knew I should have gone as a ballerina.

34:36.206 --> 34:38.675
Okay, people, let's go. Let's move along.

34:38.775 --> 34:41.505
There's no show. Let's go.
Move along, please.

34:44.614 --> 34:46.674
Welcome back to Croissants Aplenty.

34:46.751 --> 34:49.811
I didn't order...
What kind of a croissant is that?

34:50.288 --> 34:52.779
It's peanut butter. And it's on the house.

34:52.989 --> 34:55.083
Looks like it's been on the floor.

34:56.594 --> 34:59.722
You look a little down.
Did you lose the contest to your friend?

34:59.797 --> 35:01.731
Yeah. Who'd have guessed it?

35:01.799 --> 35:04.324
Especially in a place this well lit.

35:04.869 --> 35:07.360
Strange things happen on Halloween.

35:07.705 --> 35:11.004
Don't remind me. I got to go
to that party tonight on the solo tip.

35:11.375 --> 35:13.240
Don't feel too bad.

35:13.311 --> 35:16.838
There's bound to be at least
one other guy there without a date.

35:17.115 --> 35:19.675
Yeah. You know, Cindy,
you're probably right.

35:21.819 --> 35:25.255
Master William, there were
three phone messages for you.

35:25.656 --> 35:29.558
From a Miss Karen, a Miss Judy,
and a Miss Trisha.

35:29.627 --> 35:31.288
What did they say?

35:31.529 --> 35:33.690
"How desperate do you think I am?"

35:34.565 --> 35:36.760
"Not on your life."

35:37.135 --> 35:40.400
And, "Ha ha ha ha ha...

35:42.140 --> 35:43.300
"ha."

35:46.944 --> 35:50.243
So, why did the security guard
stop you, Hilary?

35:50.314 --> 35:54.045
It seems I fit the description of a shoplifter
they've been trying to catch.

35:54.118 --> 35:55.608
What was the description?

35:55.686 --> 36:00.020
I don't know exactly, but it's fair
to guess that "stunning" was part of it.

36:01.125 --> 36:03.116
Eugene said he was sorry.

36:03.528 --> 36:04.859
Who is Eugene?

36:04.929 --> 36:07.830
The security guard.
Hilary invited him to the party.

36:08.299 --> 36:09.561
Why did you do that?

36:09.634 --> 36:12.159
It seemed to speed up the paperwork.

36:12.236 --> 36:15.228
Before the party starts,
I think I'll go up and get some rest.

36:15.306 --> 36:18.969
Wait a minute. Philip,
you didn't get a costume.

36:19.043 --> 36:20.670
You went to that silly gadget store.

36:20.745 --> 36:22.940
I didn't buy a silly gadget.
I bought a stapler.

36:23.014 --> 36:27.348
<i>Only three pencils remain.
Proceed to stationery store immediately.</i>

36:29.387 --> 36:30.513
Everyone go get ready.

36:30.588 --> 36:32.488
I'm going to put my costume on now.

36:32.557 --> 36:34.024
What is it, Hilary?

36:34.125 --> 36:37.288
A gorgeous Yves Saint Laurent dress.

36:38.362 --> 36:39.556
Scary.

36:42.667 --> 36:45.898
I just got off the phone with Melinda,
my date.

36:45.970 --> 36:48.200
She's coming as Mrs. Santa Claus.

36:48.272 --> 36:51.833
I hope that doesn't conflict
with what your date will be wearing.

36:52.143 --> 36:54.668
For your information, I have a date.

36:54.946 --> 36:56.538
What's her name?

36:57.415 --> 36:59.178
Janet Girlie.

37:08.659 --> 37:11.253
Geoffrey, isn't this a fabulous party?

37:11.329 --> 37:14.492
The entire Brat Pack is here,
plus two Twin Peakers.

37:17.268 --> 37:21.864
Oh, Miss Ashley. You look
absolutely splendid in your costume.

37:21.939 --> 37:23.770
I wanted to come as a ballerina...

37:23.841 --> 37:27.299
but I guess a short guy with a mustache
is the next best thing.

37:38.189 --> 37:41.181
Carlton. White face and lipstick.

37:41.259 --> 37:44.228
Boy, you're living out
all your fantasies tonight, huh?

37:44.295 --> 37:46.786
So, sore loser, is your date here yet?

37:46.964 --> 37:48.295
She'll be here.

37:52.236 --> 37:56.969
Will, for your information, the skeleton
over there is Elizabeth McGovern...

37:57.041 --> 37:59.703
and the unicorn standing next to her
is Kevin Bacon.

37:59.777 --> 38:02.712
And they both wish
you would stop hitting on them.

38:03.614 --> 38:05.980
Why did you come as Elton John?

38:06.651 --> 38:09.142
I'm supposed to be Superfly, Hilary.

38:09.220 --> 38:11.245
Well, your super fly's open.

38:15.293 --> 38:17.352
Trick or treat!

38:18.663 --> 38:21.188
Can I take a look
inside those bags, please?

38:22.166 --> 38:24.600
What kind of outfit is that
for a Halloween party?

38:24.669 --> 38:27.035
I'm going as Comfortable Man.

38:27.638 --> 38:29.196
Is that a comic-book hero?

38:29.273 --> 38:31.741
Sort of.
He has superhuman bill-paying powers...

38:31.809 --> 38:34.369
so he gets to dress however he likes.

38:34.679 --> 38:36.476
Love that costume, Daddy.

38:42.953 --> 38:44.215
Oh, no.

38:47.258 --> 38:50.056
Well, Philip, do you know
who I'm supposed to be?

38:50.127 --> 38:52.595
I don't care. You look fantastic.

38:54.332 --> 38:56.425
What are you looking at, clown?

38:58.836 --> 39:02.772
Oh, look. There's Kiefer Sutherland
talking to River Phoenix.

39:05.576 --> 39:07.567
What happened to your date, Carlton?

39:07.645 --> 39:10.409
Did she hit her head
and her eyesight come back?

39:10.481 --> 39:11.914
She's powdering her nose.

39:11.982 --> 39:13.950
I can understand your bitterness, Will.

39:14.018 --> 39:17.181
The party's almost over,
and you lost the bet.

39:19.957 --> 39:21.618
Ladies and gentlemen...

39:22.026 --> 39:23.391
Cinderella.

39:31.602 --> 39:34.730
Hello. Is my prince here?

39:38.576 --> 39:40.009
Hello, Will.

39:40.311 --> 39:41.573
Do I know you?

39:41.645 --> 39:43.840
Give a guy your last
peanut-butter croissant...

39:43.914 --> 39:45.643
he forgets you in a minute.

39:45.716 --> 39:47.741
Cindy? The waitress?

39:47.918 --> 39:49.112
That's right.

39:49.854 --> 39:52.482
Baby, that hairnet
was doing nothing for you.

39:52.890 --> 39:55.518
Will, can I be your date tonight?

39:55.826 --> 39:58.954
Baby, forget tonight.
Let's block out the next 50 years.

39:59.296 --> 40:00.786
Why did you decide to come?

40:00.865 --> 40:03.493
Well, when the two of you showed up
at the restaurant...

40:03.567 --> 40:06.434
I thought you were just
a couple of macho clods.

40:06.570 --> 40:09.733
But when you came back,
you were so sweet.

40:11.142 --> 40:13.736
I guess I'm a sucker for a sad puppy.

40:16.680 --> 40:21.140
This doesn't affect our bet, Will.
I still found a date first.

40:21.519 --> 40:24.420
Stop it! Let go of me, you creep!

40:24.688 --> 40:26.656
Eugene, what are you doing? I thought...

40:26.724 --> 40:28.851
our agreement was
you could come to my party...

40:28.926 --> 40:31.292
but you couldn't falsely arrest anybody.

40:31.362 --> 40:33.159
This isn't a false arrest.

40:33.230 --> 40:35.664
This is the shoplifter I mistook you for.

40:35.733 --> 40:37.530
This girl's a kleptomaniac.

40:38.536 --> 40:41.096
- My silverware.
- That's my watch.

40:41.439 --> 40:42.701
My date.

40:43.474 --> 40:45.465
Let this be a lesson to all of you.

40:45.543 --> 40:48.910
You don't have to break the law
to have a happy Halloween.

40:49.447 --> 40:51.039
Good night, now.

40:57.087 --> 40:59.214
Will, may I have this dance?

40:59.657 --> 41:02.251
Yeah, baby. Your prince is in effect.

41:18.509 --> 41:19.840
Where do you live?

41:19.910 --> 41:22.879
I live with my stepmother
and her two daughters...

41:24.081 --> 41:25.412
in Encino.

41:27.585 --> 41:29.416
So, do you work every night?

41:29.553 --> 41:34.115
Yeah. I have to stay at the cafe and wait
for everyone to leave, and sweep up.

41:36.060 --> 41:38.187
Where'd you get this fly costume at?

41:38.262 --> 41:41.595
Well, I was sweeping up,
and an old lady came in...

41:41.732 --> 41:43.029
and she...

41:44.768 --> 41:46.395
It's a long story.

41:48.172 --> 41:49.196
Oh, no.

41:49.273 --> 41:51.798
I didn't know it was so late. I've got to go.

41:51.876 --> 41:52.934
Cindy, wait!

41:53.010 --> 41:54.671
I'm sorry, Will.

42:04.889 --> 42:06.049
Her slipper.

42:07.958 --> 42:09.186
Could it be?

42:11.862 --> 42:13.659
I've been touched by magic.

42:14.498 --> 42:17.228
Oh, my God.
I can't believe I dropped my shoe.

42:17.835 --> 42:20.861
Maybe I should try
some of those insole thingies.

42:20.938 --> 42:23.907
Listen, here's my number.
Call me tomorrow.

42:36.520 --> 42:38.613
I can't believe Carlton went to sleep.

42:38.689 --> 42:40.782
Why couldn't he help us clean up?

42:40.958 --> 42:44.792
If you found out the only person
in the world that would go out with you...

42:44.862 --> 42:47.797
was mentally deranged,
you'd go to bed early, too.

42:52.670 --> 42:54.535
Trick or treat!

42:54.672 --> 42:56.606
I'm sorry, we're out of candy.

42:57.708 --> 42:59.733
How come you guys came so late?

42:59.810 --> 43:01.607
<i>We were watching Matlock.</i>

43:02.947 --> 43:06.041
I got something better than candy.
A scary story.

43:12.222 --> 43:15.589
It was a cold, dreary, wintry night.

43:16.327 --> 43:18.488
October 31 was the date.

43:18.629 --> 43:21.996
There was a couple of little kids
dressed just like you...

43:22.066 --> 43:24.694
trick or treating in Bel-Air around 8:00.

43:24.902 --> 43:29.396
Now, normally Bel-Air was safe and sound.
But this year, things were ill.

43:29.540 --> 43:32.475
But, as on every Halloween,
the parents sent their kids out...

43:32.543 --> 43:34.738
not knowing this year it wasn't chill.

43:34.812 --> 43:37.440
There was a rude awakening
in this Bel-Air town...

43:37.514 --> 43:39.539
no more tranquility or peace.

43:39.617 --> 43:42.347
Not Jason, Michael Myers,
or Freddie Krueger...

43:42.419 --> 43:44.979
but this monster was called
the Bel-Air Beast.

43:45.055 --> 43:47.717
This monster was dreadfully ugly...

43:47.791 --> 43:50.021
and he bothers you when you're all alone.

43:50.094 --> 43:52.756
A face like nothing
you've ever seen before...

43:52.830 --> 43:55.060
and he reeks of Polo cologne.

43:55.399 --> 43:59.893
He stalks his victims slowly,
with the world's most terrible breath.

44:00.404 --> 44:02.929
But he doesn't use an axe or a chain saw...

44:03.007 --> 44:05.032
he talks his victims to death.

44:05.676 --> 44:08.008
So if you see this monster...

44:08.078 --> 44:10.239
run and don't look back, kids.

44:10.314 --> 44:13.408
This monster's called the Bel-Air Beast...

44:13.484 --> 44:15.782
and, oh, my goodness, there he is!
