Hmm, seven is the only number from

One, two, three, four, five,

07:28.234 --> 07:29.301
That's right.

All right, Millie...

She's not... She's not breathing.

09:47.434 --> 09:50.000
I can't feel her pulse.
I think she's...

So I just have
a couple more questions for you.

10:24.501 --> 10:25.734
Sure.

10:25.768 --> 10:28.367
Does she have any other family

Family members?

10:43.534 --> 10:45.000
Mm...

10:47.167 --> 10:48.967
Oh, I must have dozed off.

10:51.134 --> 10:54.434
Everybody was just
talking and talking,

10:54.467 --> 10:58.867
and the next thing I knew
I am dreaming.

10:58.900 --> 11:02.267
Oh, of a beautiful,
beautiful paradise.

11:03.534 --> 11:05.000
Far away from here.

11:06.034 --> 11:08.301
Come on, honey. Here we go.

11:08.334 --> 11:10.334
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'm going, hold on.

11:10.367 --> 11:13.067
Uh, one last thing.

11:14.501 --> 11:16.034
Nudge from the judge.

11:17.234 --> 11:19.867
Sign that.

11:26.200 --> 11:27.267
It's vibrating.

11:28.501 --> 11:30.334
It's a little distracting.

11:32.467 --> 11:34.000
Oh, shit.

11:34.900 --> 11:35.900
Jeez...

11:37.067 --> 11:39.467
George. Georgie.

11:40.933 --> 11:41.933
What?

11:43.933 --> 11:45.401
Yeah.

11:45.434 --> 11:46.833
My grandma died.

11:46.867 --> 11:49.567
Yeah, that's...
That's pretty sad.

11:49.601 --> 11:51.567
Um, let me call you right back.

11:51.601 --> 11:53.967
Let me... Let me call you back.

11:54.000 --> 11:55.501
Did your grandmother
really just die?

11:55.534 --> 11:57.900
Yeah, it's fine.
I don't really know her very well.

11:57.933 --> 12:02.367
Hey, do I have to do something to
get one of those or can I just...

12:02.401 --> 12:04.401
- Buy one?
- You earn these.

12:07.567 --> 12:08.933
I have to earn it.

12:08.967 --> 12:10.100
Yeah, that's true.

12:10.134 --> 12:12.301
That's how you do it.

12:12.334 --> 12:14.401
I feel like that's kind of
what I'm doing here.

12:18.900 --> 12:21.334
<i>On a quest

Hey, George.

Music.

12:42.567 --> 12:43.833
Hey!

12:48.267 --> 12:50.967
It's been a while.

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
Nothing's really changed,
huh, George?

12:55.234 --> 12:57.967
Your grandmother left these
papers in case of emergency.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.833
Don't know what's in 'em.
Rent's paid for 30 days.

13:04.434 --> 13:06.867
She didn't happen to mention a
will, did she, George?

13:08.200 --> 13:11.067
Oh, jeez. George,
what did I ever do to you?

13:11.100 --> 13:13.434
Well, for starters,
you broke into my apartment.

13:13.467 --> 13:17.501
Here we go. I made a mistake.

13:17.534 --> 13:19.900
I thought it was my grandma's.

13:19.933 --> 13:22.267
Then you tried to steal
my television set.

13:22.301 --> 13:23.867
I did steal your television set,

13:23.900 --> 13:25.467
and I'm...
I'm really sorry about that.

13:25.501 --> 13:27.200
And then
you fell off my fire escape.

13:27.234 --> 13:30.367
Okay, First of all, I was drunk.

13:32.401 --> 13:34.900
And high. Really high.

13:34.933 --> 13:37.334
And second, I just wish you
weren't still mad about that.

13:37.367 --> 13:39.534
It was years ago.

13:39.567 --> 13:41.434
That was five months ago.

13:41.467 --> 13:43.534
Hey, I'm serving the time.

13:45.234 --> 13:47.267
Look, you're gonna like this.

13:52.067 --> 13:54.401
Hmm.

13:54.434 --> 13:58.567
Besides, my brief stay with the
state was an eye-opener for me.

13:58.601 --> 14:00.434
I am motivated now.

14:00.467 --> 14:02.200
I'm a better person now.

14:02.234 --> 14:04.501
- And I've got a plan.
- Hmm.

14:05.967 --> 14:08.167

14:08.200 --> 14:12.234
I've got a plan, too.
I'm going home. Been a rough day.

14:12.267 --> 14:16.334

know, I'm right down the hall.

If you don't mind,
I'm going back to bed.

19:51.867 --> 19:53.334
Braid your hair.

19:53.367 --> 19:54.967
What?

19:55.000 --> 19:57.401
- What was that?
- Braid your hair.

19:57.434 --> 20:00.100
I don't have hair.
It's too short. So I'm not...

20:00.134 --> 20:01.501
Braid your hair!
Braid your hair.

20:02.367 --> 20:03.601
Oh.

20:03.634 --> 20:06.134
- Braid your hair! Braid your hair.
- Uh-huh. I know. I got it.

20:06.167 --> 20:07.167
I don't know how...

20:07.200 --> 20:09.367
Braid your hair. Braid your hair.
Braid your hair.

20:09.401 --> 20:11.367
Braid your hair!

20:11.401 --> 20:14.200
Shh! I was just...

20:14.234 --> 20:16.134
Hey! It's okay.
Music, it's okay!

20:16.167 --> 20:17.401
- It's...
- Ouch.

20:17.434 --> 20:18.867
Shit.

20:18.900 --> 20:20.301
Calm down.

20:20.334 --> 20:22.867
Calm down! Calm down! It's okay.

20:22.900 --> 20:24.034
Music!

20:25.301 --> 20:26.967
Ow...

20:27.000 --> 20:28.334
Oh, my God.

20:28.367 --> 20:30.234
Damn it.

20:30.267 --> 20:31.367
Hold on!

20:36.401 --> 20:37.734
Hi there.

20:37.768 --> 20:40.401
- I don't know what I'm doing.
- I don't know how to do...

20:40.434 --> 20:41.833
Music.

20:41.867 --> 20:44.467
- She's just freaking out.
- It's your friend, Ebo. You know me.

20:45.200 --> 20:47.434
Trust me.

20:47.467 --> 20:50.467
I'm going to crush you now,
and make you feel safe.

20:51.967 --> 20:53.833
- Come on.
- You're not hurting her, are you?

20:53.867 --> 20:57.034
No, I'm not.
I'm crushing her with my love.

20:58.334 --> 21:00.301
She will be all right.

21:04.534 --> 21:06.467
I don't like that.

21:06.501 --> 21:07.867
I don't like that.

21:09.100 --> 21:11.034
You cannot hit yourself
like that, Music.

21:12.100 --> 21:13.434
Okay?

21:13.467 --> 21:17.267
Your friend Ebo doesn't want to
see you hurt yourself like that.

21:17.301 --> 21:19.067
All right?

21:19.100 --> 21:21.534
How about some chewing gum?
I know where you keep it.

21:22.534 --> 21:24.234
Braid your hair.

21:24.267 --> 21:25.401
Braid your hair.

21:27.067 --> 21:28.134
All right.

21:28.933 --> 21:30.167
I think I can do that.

21:32.234 --> 21:33.267
Let's go.

21:34.634 --> 21:35.900
It's all right.

21:37.134 --> 21:38.334
Sit here.

21:38.367 --> 21:39.467
Chewing gum.

21:41.334 --> 21:44.134
As I was saying,
I live next door.

21:45.567 --> 21:47.034
I'm sorry for your loss.

21:48.167 --> 21:50.234
I knew Millie very well.

21:50.267 --> 21:53.567
If there is anything
I can offer...

21:55.100 --> 21:57.234
to help you
in your time of need,

21:57.267 --> 21:58.401
just let me know.

22:00.367 --> 22:01.367
Can you move in?

22:05.933 --> 22:07.301
I am close by.

22:08.534 --> 22:10.234
All right, Music.

22:10.267 --> 22:12.034
Let's get you a braid.

22:12.067 --> 22:13.434
Okay.

22:13.467 --> 22:18.867
And the blue one goes on this side.

22:18.900 --> 22:20.000
I know that.

22:20.768 --> 22:22.234
Okay.

22:22.267 --> 22:23.567
Let's get the other side.

22:27.401 --> 22:28.401
Ebo?

22:29.467 --> 22:31.800
Ebo, yes. E-B-O.

22:33.100 --> 22:34.167
And you are?

22:34.200 --> 22:35.967
Really stressed out.

22:36.000 --> 22:37.367
I'm really
stressed out.

22:37.401 --> 22:38.501
No, I'm Zu.

22:38.534 --> 22:40.234
- Zoo?
- Zu.

22:40.267 --> 22:43.467
Kazu, but Zu, with a U.

22:43.501 --> 22:45.267
- Z-U.
- Z-U.

22:45.867 --> 22:46.867
Zu.

22:51.501 --> 22:53.601
All right, Music.

22:53.634 --> 22:55.900
We are all done.

22:55.933 --> 22:57.167
Very impressive.

22:57.200 --> 22:58.234
It is nothing.

22:58.800 --> 23:00.933
Right, this way, Music.

23:02.367 --> 23:03.434
Okay.

23:03.467 --> 23:07.067
Do you know how often
she's been having episodes?

23:08.933 --> 23:10.534
I've only lived here,
like, ten hours,

23:10.567 --> 23:12.367
so, no.

23:12.401 --> 23:14.401
That is true.

23:14.434 --> 23:19.367
Oh, but Millie wrote
a bunch of stuff down on, um...

23:21.534 --> 23:22.833
In a... In a book.

23:23.867 --> 23:25.100
And, uh...

23:25.134 --> 23:28.234
Music, I cannot imagine
what you must be feeling today.

23:29.367 --> 23:31.501
Maybe that'll be helpful.

23:34.534 --> 23:35.800
Okay.

23:40.367 --> 23:44.167
So this is the book and...

23:47.000 --> 23:48.334
Her whole life's a schedule.

23:48.367 --> 23:50.301
She takes a walk each morning.

23:50.334 --> 23:52.434
- Oh.
- We have it coordinated.

23:52.467 --> 23:55.833
I can go with you if you'd like,
show you the route she takes.

23:55.867 --> 23:57.334
If you'd like.

23:57.367 --> 23:59.267
- Where's she... Where's she going?
- Walk.

24:02.067 --> 24:03.501
Oh, thanks.

24:06.067 --> 24:08.501
I keep sweating,
and you're the one who did all the work.

24:09.367 --> 24:12.267
How do you know
how to calm her down?

24:13.100 --> 24:14.501
How do you do that?

24:14.534 --> 24:17.167
In Ghana, my younger
brother was the same way.

24:17.200 --> 24:20.933
- Little Miss Muffet.
- He liked to be held to feel safe.

24:21.567 --> 24:22.567
Where is he now?

24:23.301 --> 24:24.501
He is dead now.

24:25.267 --> 24:28.200
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

24:28.234 --> 24:30.933
Special needs are not
well understood in my country.

24:30.967 --> 24:34.501
In fact, in my village,
it was considered a curse.

24:35.301 --> 24:37.200
Greenwich Village?

24:37.234 --> 24:40.534
No, not... Definitely not
Greenwich Village.

24:40.567 --> 24:42.034
Aah...

24:42.067 --> 24:43.933
Are you always stoned?

24:43.967 --> 24:46.134
Are you just
the smiliest person on Earth?

24:46.167 --> 24:48.267
No, I don't take drugs.

24:48.301 --> 24:50.434
Me neither, actually.

24:50.467 --> 24:54.134
But that's just 'cause
I took way too many.

24:54.167 --> 24:56.267
So I'm not allowed
to take them anymore.

24:56.301 --> 24:58.334
So the same, but opposite.

24:59.900 --> 25:00.900
Okay.

25:06.167 --> 25:10.167
She's allergic to bees,
penicillin and nuts.

25:10.200 --> 25:12.967
Your grandma
kept thorough records.

25:13.000 --> 25:15.900
Yeah, well, she wasn't
much of a thrower-awayer.

25:18.867 --> 25:20.601
No bed-wetting
for two years.

25:20.634 --> 25:22.900
Is that what
she's keeping track of?

25:27.367 --> 25:28.833
Uh...

25:29.301 --> 25:30.334
Hmm?

25:30.367 --> 25:32.234
I wet the bed four months ago.

25:35.534 --> 25:36.833
Were you close with her?

25:38.567 --> 25:40.401
No, no. We were not close.

25:41.501 --> 25:43.601
Who's close with their grandma?

25:43.634 --> 25:45.367
I spoke to my grandmother
this morning.

25:46.267 --> 25:49.234
- Of course you did.
- Uh... Uh...

25:55.434 --> 25:56.467
So many phones.

25:57.933 --> 25:59.200
What do you do?

25:59.234 --> 26:00.334
What don't I do?

26:01.867 --> 26:03.301
That's the...
That's the question.

26:03.334 --> 26:06.501
Right now I'm just trying to figure
out how to get to paradise, so...

26:06.534 --> 26:07.967
Where is paradise?

26:08.401 --> 26:10.067
Costa Rica.

26:10.100 --> 26:13.167
Gonna get a plot of land,
live by the ocean,

26:13.200 --> 26:14.867
grow my own food,

26:14.900 --> 26:16.567
teach yoga.

26:16.601 --> 26:17.933
Paradise.

26:17.967 --> 26:19.034
You teach yoga?

26:21.067 --> 26:22.134
What don't I do?

26:23.100 --> 26:24.467
What, so you do teach yoga?

26:24.501 --> 26:28.200
Well, I mean,
I can stand on my head and I can...

26:28.234 --> 26:30.301
you know, play dead.

26:30.334 --> 26:33.034
Isn't that kind of
what you need to know?

26:33.067 --> 26:35.601
I think
it's a little more than that.

26:35.634 --> 26:38.434
Yeah, well,
those who cannot do, teach.

26:38.467 --> 26:40.367
So I think I'm overqualified.

26:41.367 --> 26:43.200
How about you?

26:43.234 --> 26:45.567
How can you afford
this grand palace?

26:46.567 --> 26:48.167
I teach...

26:49.567 --> 26:50.967
...boxing to kids.

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
Great.

26:53.034 --> 26:55.401
I'm hungry.
You want to go get something to eat?

26:55.434 --> 26:58.034
And I forgot my wallet,
which means you'll have to get it,

26:58.067 --> 26:59.401
and then I can do it next time.

26:59.434 --> 27:01.334
I can't right now,
but, um,

27:01.367 --> 27:04.567
maybe later I can stop by
and help out with Music.

27:04.601 --> 27:09.367
Oh, I was actually planning on
sending her to a people pound later,

27:10.234 --> 27:12.234
but guess I'll keep her
a little longer.

27:16.567 --> 27:18.301
Oh, my God.
Did you think I was...

27:18.334 --> 27:19.967
I'm not serious.

27:20.000 --> 27:22.833
- I mean, I'm... Well, kind of...
- Hey.

27:22.867 --> 27:24.367
- I didn't mean it like that.
- I know.

27:26.867 --> 27:27.933
Gotcha.

27:31.200 --> 27:32.833
I'm getting you.

27:32.867 --> 27:36.267
There's a dark girl vibe
you got going on.

27:36.301 --> 27:38.301
- See you later.
- I'm not that dark.

27:38.334 --> 27:39.401
All right.

27:50.367 --> 27:52.200
You're late again.

27:54.434 --> 27:56.867
Remind me why we adopt this...

28:05.501 --> 28:06.967
All right.

28:07.000 --> 28:12.567
Let's see if we can shake some cash
out of this old rat trap, huh, Music?

28:13.501 --> 28:15.234
What's behind door number one?

28:24.034 --> 28:25.034
Jesus.

28:39.900 --> 28:40.900
No.

28:43.000 --> 28:45.267
That is way too easy.

28:46.100 --> 28:47.501
Come on, Millie.

28:59.100 --> 29:01.067
Can't believe
I'm related to these people.

29:06.334 --> 29:07.334
Whoop...

29:09.567 --> 29:13.000
Then again,
I can totally believe we're related.

29:17.367 --> 29:18.367
Ah.

29:19.167 --> 29:20.800
See you in paradise.

29:23.567 --> 29:24.967
<i>I love you.</i>

29:25.000 --> 29:26.867
<i>You...</i>

29:54.534 --> 29:57.200
<i>♪ They're
radical They're magical...</i>

29:57.234 --> 29:59.267
- <i>♪ They're Radgical... ♪</i>
- Music.

29:59.301 --> 30:01.467
Hey, turn this off.

30:01.501 --> 30:03.100
- Ahh...
- Check this out.

30:04.401 --> 30:08.334
I remember these being
so much bigger then...

30:08.367 --> 30:09.967
Here.

30:10.634 --> 30:12.501
So great.

30:12.534 --> 30:15.134
Oh, my God.

30:16.267 --> 30:18.434
Look, it's Raindrop.

30:19.501 --> 30:22.200
You remember Raindrop?

30:22.234 --> 30:23.933
Maybe you were too little.

30:23.967 --> 30:26.000
Raindrop was my dog.

30:28.334 --> 30:31.034
He had seizures, too,
just like you.

30:33.200 --> 30:34.467
And then he was hit by a car.

30:35.967 --> 30:39.034
Because Mom...
Mom left the door open.

30:42.000 --> 30:43.067
You remember Mom?

30:49.467 --> 30:51.034
She was a junkie.

30:51.067 --> 30:52.200
Go to bed.

30:56.401 --> 30:57.933
Big junkie.

31:12.434 --> 31:13.933
That is such a bummer.

31:13.967 --> 31:16.000
No. I remember
when <i>mi abuela</i> died,

31:16.034 --> 31:19.601
I was a mess for, like, a year.

31:19.634 --> 31:22.234
- <i>Mi abuela?</i> ("My grandmother"?)
- Yeah.

31:22.267 --> 31:24.401
- No, I don't mind that she's...
- Just let it out.

31:24.434 --> 31:27.034
You need to let it out. You need
to let it out. You need to scream.

31:27.067 --> 31:28.601
You need to say something.
Tell me how you feel.

31:28.634 --> 31:30.833
- Let it out. Yes.
- I don't need to scream out.

31:30.867 --> 31:34.000
No, really. I mean, I know I'm not
supposed to say this out loud, but...

31:34.034 --> 31:35.401
I don't care.

31:36.634 --> 31:37.800
You're not processing it yet.

31:37.833 --> 31:40.100
- No, I can prove it.
- You'll process on your own time.

31:40.134 --> 31:41.900
- I don't...
- You process on your own time, okay?

31:41.933 --> 31:43.501
- I don't...
- You will. Do you hear me?

31:43.534 --> 31:46.367
- You're going to process on your own time.
- I don't care, Rudy.

31:46.401 --> 31:48.467
Okay. All right, thank you.

31:48.501 --> 31:51.000
- Do you feel what I'm giving you?
- Yeah, I felt it.

31:55.200 --> 31:56.234
Yes...

31:59.000 --> 32:01.900
As you know,
before we get started,

32:01.933 --> 32:04.401
- I'm gonna to need to see a little bit of... Right.
- Oh!

32:04.434 --> 32:06.134
Ha-ha!

32:10.234 --> 32:11.267
Whoops.

32:11.301 --> 32:12.367
Whoops.

32:12.401 --> 32:14.234
This feels light.

32:14.267 --> 32:15.401
Why does this feel light?

32:17.167 --> 32:18.200
It's a little light.

32:18.234 --> 32:20.301
You know it's not supposed
to be a little light.

32:20.334 --> 32:22.034
- It's a little light.
- It can't be a little light!

32:22.067 --> 32:23.501
You can't say,
"It's a little light."

32:23.534 --> 32:25.900
Do you have the rest in the backpack?
Do you wanna give it to me now?

32:25.933 --> 32:28.534
- I'm gonna be in this apartment rent-free.
- Oh.

32:28.567 --> 32:32.200
My Grandma Millie has, like,
fifty years of stuff

32:32.234 --> 32:33.900
that's potentially
worth something.

32:35.200 --> 32:36.467
I'm gonna get your money.

32:36.501 --> 32:38.401
- What do you say?
- No. I say no.

32:38.434 --> 32:40.333
Don't... Put the pen down.
I say no!

32:40.367 --> 32:41.833
I shouldn't even
let you get this far...

32:41.867 --> 32:43.967
Don't dance.
Don't <i>Thriller</i> dance!

32:44.000 --> 32:45.167
Stop it. Stop!

32:45.200 --> 32:46.501
Listen to me, okay?

32:46.534 --> 32:47.900
- Yes.
- Do you understand how it works?

32:47.933 --> 32:50.867
If you don't give me what I need,
then I have to do something bad.

32:50.900 --> 32:53.034
I don't wanna do something bad.
Do you understand?

32:55.367 --> 32:57.100
I'm here, right?

32:57.134 --> 32:59.833
- I'm trying. I really am.
- Trying?

32:59.867 --> 33:01.200
- I'm trying.
- We're all trying.

33:01.234 --> 33:02.301
Oh, come on.

33:03.467 --> 33:04.933
Can I just have a hundred?

33:07.467 --> 33:09.501
Come on!

33:09.534 --> 33:12.301
- Twenty. And I'm only doing it because you make me laugh.
- Boo.

33:12.334 --> 33:13.601
You know what I mean?

33:13.634 --> 33:15.234
Because I don't even want to do
it, but I think it's funny.

33:15.267 --> 33:17.167
- A hundred. Please.
- A hundred's hilarious.

33:17.200 --> 33:20.167
- Rudy. When have I ever let you down?
- Regularly.

33:20.200 --> 33:22.501
One second ago.
Do you remember this?

33:22.534 --> 33:24.601
You gave me this, and I said,
"It's light," and you go, "A little light."

33:24.634 --> 33:26.601
The whole thing that just happened.
Do you not remember?

33:26.634 --> 33:27.768
- Okay.
- So this is what's gonna happen.

33:27.800 --> 33:30.301
I'm gonna give you that twenty,
you're gonna take it.

33:30.334 --> 33:32.134
If you sell it,
you get twenty more.

33:32.167 --> 33:35.367
All right, hand out,
palm up and close and kiss.

33:35.401 --> 33:37.067
Of course.

33:37.100 --> 33:38.301
'Cause it's transactional.

33:51.467 --> 33:53.401
Shh!
My mom is asleep

33:53.434 --> 33:55.967
and she's going through
a divorce. So she's...

33:56.000 --> 33:57.833
staying with me.

34:01.334 --> 34:04.067
Did you get, uh, what I needed?

34:05.467 --> 34:06.601
Two of everything?

34:06.634 --> 34:08.301
Yeah, everything.

34:08.334 --> 34:11.601
I figure then I could mix
and I can serve a sample

34:11.634 --> 34:14.567
and figure out
what's gonna work.

34:14.601 --> 34:16.401
She just complains incessantly,

34:16.434 --> 34:18.501
and I'm literally reduced
to when I was 14.

34:18.534 --> 34:20.000
Is your mom still alive?

34:20.034 --> 34:21.200
No.

34:21.234 --> 34:23.067
Oh, lucky you.

34:23.100 --> 34:26.067
Evelyn,
can you please change this channel?

34:26.100 --> 34:27.301
I don't know how.

34:27.334 --> 34:29.833
My sister
loves that show.

34:29.867 --> 34:32.234
You know, some people
would say this is a gift

34:32.267 --> 34:34.367
to be able to spend time
with their mom...

34:34.401 --> 34:35.900
- Oh.
- ...in retirement.

34:35.933 --> 34:40.100
Wow, these are pretty. Which one is
gonna make me feel, like, less hostile?

34:40.134 --> 34:41.167
Blue.

34:41.200 --> 34:42.833
- Oh.
- You'll like the blue.

34:42.867 --> 34:44.100
Blue? Great.

34:44.134 --> 34:46.833
Evelyn, where is my food?

34:46.867 --> 34:49.134
I'm starving. Could you please?

34:49.167 --> 34:50.100
Yes, it's coming.

34:50.134 --> 34:53.900
I called the guy
five minutes ago, remember?

34:53.933 --> 34:55.301
Lose the tone.

34:57.234 --> 35:01.267
Oh, um, my friend
wants to talk to you.

35:01.301 --> 35:04.167
Oh, no, I don't think I should
bring on new customers right now.

35:04.200 --> 35:06.134
- What? She's loaded.
- No.

35:06.167 --> 35:08.067
No, you need
to make an exception.

35:08.100 --> 35:10.867
I'm gonna give you
her assistant's number.

35:10.900 --> 35:13.933
Honey, this could be
your ticket to paradise.

35:18.367 --> 35:20.367
I... I already did that, sir.

35:20.401 --> 35:24.567
Unfortunately, I do not qualify
for their clinical trial.

35:24.601 --> 35:29.867
Yes, but I cannot afford
to stay alive at these prices.

35:29.900 --> 35:32.267
How else am I supposed
to afford my...

35:35.167 --> 35:38.167
Sir, I...
I need this medication.

35:40.467 --> 35:41.467
Okay.

35:43.234 --> 35:44.301
Thank you for your time.

35:47.401 --> 35:50.534
Right. And if you are happy,
press this one.

35:50.567 --> 35:52.167
<i>I am sad.</i>

35:53.034 --> 35:55.267
Very funny, troublemaker.

35:55.301 --> 35:58.134
No, silly. If you are happy,
which one? This one.

35:59.933 --> 36:01.900
- <i>I am happy.</i>
- Very good.

36:03.301 --> 36:04.867
And if you are scared.

36:07.867 --> 36:08.933
<i>I am scared.</i>

36:08.967 --> 36:10.967
That is so good, Music.

36:11.000 --> 36:13.467
I press that one
myself sometimes

36:13.501 --> 36:16.234
when I'm by myself.

36:16.267 --> 36:19.567
- Okay, and this goes from this side...
- Hey, you guys!

36:19.601 --> 36:21.134
Yoo-hoo!

36:22.200 --> 36:25.134
You guys, come see what I got!

36:25.167 --> 36:26.900
What are you doing, sister?

36:26.933 --> 36:29.200
What do you think I'm doing?
I'm celebrating.

36:29.234 --> 36:30.501
Come down here.

36:30.534 --> 36:33.501
All right, I'll admit it's not
as big as it looked on the box,

36:33.534 --> 36:37.900
but who cares?

36:37.933 --> 36:39.567
We're about to have
a pool party!

36:39.601 --> 36:41.833
- <i>I am happy.</i>
- Yes.

36:41.867 --> 36:43.467
Yes.

36:43.501 --> 36:45.167
You wanna come in?

36:45.200 --> 36:47.334
Music.

36:47.367 --> 36:49.833
Do you want to put your hands
in the water like this?

36:49.867 --> 36:51.833
Come on, come on.

36:51.867 --> 36:53.234
Press this for yes, this for no.

36:55.867 --> 36:56.900
<i>No.</i>

36:56.933 --> 36:58.301
No? No! Yes!

36:58.334 --> 37:00.167
You don't have to.

37:00.200 --> 37:02.267
But it's so refreshing.

37:02.833 --> 37:06.501
Come on, Music, come on.

37:06.534 --> 37:08.034
- Yes or no?
- <i>No.</i>

37:08.067 --> 37:09.800
- Come on!
- Very good, Music.

37:10.401 --> 37:11.933
Oh, my gosh.

37:11.967 --> 37:13.467
She knows what she wants.

37:13.501 --> 37:15.200
Hey, what's going on down there?

37:15.234 --> 37:17.334
Water is not free, you know?

37:17.367 --> 37:20.134
But we're
setting it free, George.

37:20.167 --> 37:21.933
Whoo!

37:23.867 --> 37:25.867
Yes, George!

37:26.900 --> 37:28.933
Come on, guys, it'll be fun.

40:24.434 --> 40:26.601
This is your place?

No, not yet.

40:29.034 --> 40:30.534
It's just where I teach.

40:30.567 --> 40:32.167
Boxing and self-defense.

40:33.634 --> 40:37.000
My place would be smaller,
better, more personal.

40:37.034 --> 40:39.434
Music! Why don't you sit here?

40:39.467 --> 40:42.167
Watch these fighters,
let them know what they're doing wrong.

40:45.434 --> 40:47.401
There'll be tournaments
coming up next week.

40:48.301 --> 40:50.501
You ever been
to a boxing match before?

40:50.534 --> 40:53.501
No, but I've been
in plenty of fights.

40:53.534 --> 40:55.434
Hit this.

40:55.467 --> 40:57.567
Hit it.

40:57.601 --> 40:59.401
Okay, I'm not...

41:01.367 --> 41:03.567
Pull from your hip more.
The back hip.

41:04.967 --> 41:05.967
Oh.

41:07.334 --> 41:09.000
Yeah, not bad.

41:09.034 --> 41:10.467
I can do this!

41:10.501 --> 41:12.501
I can do it. I can do it.

41:12.534 --> 41:16.833
Do you have to, like,
hate the person when you're fighting them?

41:16.867 --> 41:18.234
You don't have to.

41:18.267 --> 41:20.034
Depends on what motivates you.

41:20.067 --> 41:22.933
What motivated you,

41:22.967 --> 41:28.301
Mr. New York Zone Amateur
Middleweight Regional Champion, 2007?

41:28.334 --> 41:30.167
The desire to prove myself.

41:30.200 --> 41:31.401
Oh.

41:33.200 --> 41:34.334
So why did you stop?

41:35.567 --> 41:37.167
It was my time.

41:41.167 --> 41:44.367
See, maybe change
is a good thing for her.

41:44.401 --> 41:46.467
New routine, a little boxing,

41:46.501 --> 41:48.301
everyone loves
a walk in the park.

41:48.334 --> 41:51.234
I'm not saying
she doesn't want to change.

41:52.367 --> 41:55.067
I'm saying she can't change.

41:55.100 --> 41:58.267
Well, that's one thing
we both have in common.

41:58.301 --> 42:02.933
For her, each change comes
with a barrage of new stimuli.

42:11.933 --> 42:13.000
The headphones.

42:15.100 --> 42:16.534
It's called audio filtering.

42:16.567 --> 42:20.301
Her hearing is so sensitive she
can hear whispering two rooms away.

42:21.167 --> 42:22.200
What?

42:23.000 --> 42:24.034
It's true.

42:24.067 --> 42:26.534
<i>Shut up, please.</i>

42:28.467 --> 42:31.334
<i>...your sister,
who could use your love and care.</i>

42:31.367 --> 42:33.867
<i>You won't remember this,
but when she was little,</i>

42:33.900 --> 42:37.334
<i>she clung to you
like a koala bear,</i>

42:37.367 --> 42:39.434
<i>like you were
a tall eucalyptus tree.</i>

42:39.467 --> 42:42.501
She can understand everything
you are saying to her.

42:42.534 --> 42:45.933
Maybe not right then.
How it works is she hears it...

42:45.967 --> 42:47.401
<i>There you go.</i>

42:47.434 --> 42:49.167
...she files it away,

42:49.200 --> 42:51.234
and then sometimes
it is returned

42:51.267 --> 42:53.534
to her main system
three weeks later.

42:54.567 --> 42:55.867
<i>There you go.</i>

42:57.267 --> 42:59.167
You know how she looks at you

42:59.200 --> 43:00.567
and then looks away quickly?

43:01.567 --> 43:03.467
She has taken a snapshot.

43:08.634 --> 43:10.434
If she didn't look away,

43:10.467 --> 43:12.367
it would totally overwhelm her.

43:17.100 --> 43:20.334
She sees the world in a
completely different way from us.

43:52.933 --> 43:54.200
Oh... Oh, God.

43:54.234 --> 43:55.267
Music.

43:55.301 --> 43:58.134
Come on, Ebo, do that thing.

43:58.167 --> 44:01.833
I'm not climbing on top of a small screaming
white girl in the middle of this park.

44:01.867 --> 44:03.167
- It's your turn.
- My turn?

44:03.200 --> 44:05.100
You can do this.
I'll talk you through it.

44:05.134 --> 44:07.301
- Go ahead.
- I can't.

44:07.334 --> 44:08.933
Okay, Music, it's okay.

44:08.967 --> 44:11.234
Ouch! She's hitting me.

44:11.267 --> 44:13.034
She doesn't know
who she is hitting.

44:13.067 --> 44:14.000
Okay, stop, stop.

44:14.034 --> 44:16.200
Hold her tight.
Squeeze her like a bear.

44:16.234 --> 44:17.467
Okay. Okay, okay, okay. Shh.

44:17.501 --> 44:19.401
- Hold her.
- It's okay, it's okay. It's okay.

44:19.434 --> 44:21.334
- Tell her she's safe.
- It's okay, you're safe.

44:21.367 --> 44:24.334
- You have to tell her like you believe it.
- I don't believe it.

44:24.367 --> 44:27.134
Ugh! I can't do this!

44:28.467 --> 44:31.434
Music. Okay.

44:35.967 --> 44:38.367
It's okay, it's okay.

44:38.401 --> 44:40.234
Okay, you're safe.

44:40.267 --> 44:41.967
You're safe, you're with me.

44:42.000 --> 44:44.334
You're okay. It's your sister.

44:53.034 --> 44:54.034
It's all right.

44:54.434 --> 44:55.467
Thank you.

44:55.501 --> 44:57.000
You're fine?

45:01.334 --> 45:02.334
Better?

45:13.267 --> 45:14.501
Should we get a snow cone?

45:18.000 --> 45:19.100
We'll get a snow cone.

45:30.000 --> 45:31.000
Rainbow.

45:32.401 --> 45:33.401
You got it?

45:37.467 --> 45:39.434
I think it's good
you are here with her.

45:39.467 --> 45:41.134
It's good for her,

45:41.167 --> 45:42.900
you two being so close in age.

45:43.601 --> 45:45.234
You think I'm close to her age?

45:46.601 --> 45:48.401
Uh, emotionally.

45:51.067 --> 45:53.467
- That's good. Oh!
- Emotionally, you are very close in age.

45:53.501 --> 45:56.501
You are, mm, nine, eight...

45:56.534 --> 45:59.100
- I am twice her age.
- Okay.

45:59.134 --> 46:00.167
My mistake.

46:00.200 --> 46:01.434
What?

46:02.567 --> 46:03.800
What's so funny?

46:04.967 --> 46:06.867
- What?
- You act like a child.

46:07.833 --> 46:10.100
That's nice of you.
Is that a compliment?

46:10.134 --> 46:11.467
Are you complimenting me?

46:12.334 --> 46:13.367
Maybe.

46:14.900 --> 46:15.900
What is that?

46:16.967 --> 46:19.167
Oh, it's Raindrop.

46:20.367 --> 46:21.401
My spirit animal.

46:23.100 --> 46:25.234
Okay.

46:25.267 --> 46:28.034
How long do you think
you and Raindrop will stay?

46:29.601 --> 46:31.301
Here? I don't know.

46:31.334 --> 46:33.601
As long as it takes
to tie up some loose ends

46:33.634 --> 46:36.900
and then I need
to get my ticket to paradise.

46:38.367 --> 46:39.367
What about you?

46:40.334 --> 46:42.167
Me?

46:42.200 --> 46:44.434
I'm quite comfortable here.

46:44.467 --> 46:46.401
Look, don't give me that.

46:47.634 --> 46:48.833
I think you're sad.

46:51.467 --> 46:53.800
What is this?

46:55.000 --> 46:56.134
Not again, eh?

46:58.467 --> 47:00.367
Perfect timing.

47:00.401 --> 47:03.334
- The whole block is dark again.
- Saved by the blackout.

47:05.900 --> 47:08.367
- Does Millie have a lantern?
- Lantern?

47:09.100 --> 47:11.567
What am I, a headless horseman?

47:12.634 --> 47:13.900
Well, look at that.

47:15.100 --> 47:17.200
A lantern, smart-ass.

47:20.134 --> 47:21.334
Okay. All right.

47:21.367 --> 47:23.100
Are you gonna
tell me your sad story

47:23.134 --> 47:24.800
or am I gonna have to guess?

47:25.301 --> 47:26.301
All right.

47:28.000 --> 47:29.000
My wife,

47:30.234 --> 47:31.234
ex-wife,

47:32.434 --> 47:34.034
left me for my brother.

47:36.401 --> 47:37.434
That's it?

47:38.967 --> 47:40.367
That's it for now.

47:40.401 --> 47:42.301
I'll tell you the rest
another time.

47:43.867 --> 47:45.000
What about you?

47:45.601 --> 47:46.800
My turn.

47:47.900 --> 47:49.334
See that scar?

47:49.367 --> 47:51.134
You know how I got it?

47:51.167 --> 47:52.467
Falling off the fire escape.

47:53.867 --> 47:54.933
George told me.

47:54.967 --> 47:56.267
Oh, George. Right.

47:57.434 --> 47:59.401
Maybe George doesn't know
the entire story.

48:00.967 --> 48:04.134
Maybe my plan the entire time

48:05.401 --> 48:07.501
was to climb up there
and jump off.

48:10.501 --> 48:12.200
And maybe on my way up,

48:12.234 --> 48:13.434
I just...

48:17.267 --> 48:18.301
I just couldn't do it.

48:24.134 --> 48:25.134
So...

48:30.467 --> 48:31.833
Thank you for having me.

48:39.000 --> 48:40.234
I should be leaving.

48:40.267 --> 48:41.367
Oh, don't go.

48:57.967 --> 48:59.367
I wanna give you something.

as it is to throw one.

51:58.634 --> 51:59.967

53:30.900 --> 53:33.501
'cause the beaches
in Costa Rica are beautiful.

53:33.534 --> 53:36.067
And you can camp on them
and stay on them forever.

53:37.601 --> 53:40.301
Do you speak Spanish?

53:40.334 --> 53:43.200
I didn't speak English,
but picked that up pretty good.

53:44.867 --> 53:46.234
That sounds so nice.

53:47.434 --> 53:49.134
It's a song Millie wrote.

53:49.167 --> 53:50.034
No, I... I know.

53:50.067 --> 53:52.900
- I know that one.
- Come sing it with me.

53:52.933 --> 53:55.601
No, I gotta clean some stuff up.

53:55.634 --> 53:57.034
Sister, come, come.

53:57.067 --> 53:59.567
No, because I'm gonna sing,

53:59.601 --> 54:01.367
and then you're gonna be like,

54:01.401 --> 54:03.900
"Oh, you should've
been a singer."

54:03.933 --> 54:07.200
- I'll risk it.

54:08.567 --> 54:10.301

54:10.334 --> 54:11.434

55:55.301 --> 55:56.334
From my brother.

55:57.301 --> 55:59.367
Your brother,
the one marrying the ex-wife?

56:02.501 --> 56:04.267
Oh, this is nice.

56:05.367 --> 56:08.234
Why are you carrying this
around in your wallet?

56:08.267 --> 56:11.334
As a reminder
to go to the wedding.

56:11.367 --> 56:13.900
- To murder him?
- He's my brother.

56:13.933 --> 56:15.267
I'm going to wish him well.

56:15.301 --> 56:16.367
Oh...

56:16.401 --> 56:19.601
- Wish him well?
- I'm past it, right?

56:19.634 --> 56:22.234
I'm going to stand there
and I'm going to smile

56:22.267 --> 56:24.900

56:24.933 --> 56:26.434
Like that? Don't wave like that.

56:36.900 --> 56:37.900
Okay.

56:39.434 --> 56:40.833
I'm coming with you.

We're coming. Music and me.

56:44.467 --> 56:46.000
We're going to be your dates.

56:46.034 --> 56:49.567
And we're not only
gonna smile and wave like this,

56:49.601 --> 56:53.134
we're going to give a big toast.

56:54.034 --> 56:57.200
You can play a song or two.

56:57.234 --> 57:01.334
I can get wasted

57:01.367 --> 57:03.200

57:09.967 --> 57:10.967
Good.

57:13.234 --> 57:14.234
Go to bed.

57:18.334 --> 57:20.200
I think she's trying
to tell us something.

Is it?

57:30.467 --> 57:31.467
Hmm.

57:33.601 --> 57:36.267
Then you should... go.

57:38.867 --> 57:40.100
I probably should.

57:47.334 --> 57:48.334
Get some sleep.

57:50.601 --> 57:51.800

- Make you eggs.
- Oh, yikes.

1:00:27.900 --> 1:00:29.534
Make you eggs. Make you eggs.

1:00:32.634 --> 1:00:35.334
Oh, God.

1:00:35.367 --> 1:00:38.234
George. Just the man
I'm looking for.

1:00:38.267 --> 1:00:40.134
- Yeah.
- I was talking with Music

1:00:40.167 --> 1:00:43.567
and she was saying how she wants
to spend a lot more time with you.

1:00:43.601 --> 1:00:45.867
So, like, from now until 4:30?

1:00:45.900 --> 1:00:47.933
No, no, no. No, no, no.
No, no, no, no.

1:00:47.967 --> 1:00:49.534
Oh, pretty please?

1:00:49.567 --> 1:00:51.567
Look, you were
two hours late last time.

1:00:51.601 --> 1:00:53.434
Come on,
this is your responsibility.

1:00:53.467 --> 1:00:54.867
Grow up.

1:00:54.900 --> 1:00:57.234
I thought
that's what I was doing.

1:00:59.967 --> 1:01:01.200
Okay, I do not feel good

1:01:01.234 --> 1:01:03.867
about bringing you along
here with me today.

1:01:03.900 --> 1:01:07.900
Can we try not to have one of your
freak-outs up there, all right?

1:01:07.933 --> 1:01:09.833
Like, I do not
know these people,

1:01:09.867 --> 1:01:11.234
but apparently, they're loaded,

1:01:11.267 --> 1:01:13.200
and I'd really
like to keep them as clients.

1:01:13.234 --> 1:01:14.867
So can we get it out now?

1:01:14.900 --> 1:01:17.200
- Just, like, if you can try to get it out now...
- Uh...

1:01:17.933 --> 1:01:18.933
Okay.

1:01:19.467 --> 1:01:20.467
All right.

1:01:23.134 --> 1:01:25.567
Yes, no problem.
She will call you right back.

1:01:25.601 --> 1:01:28.100
- Excuse me. Hi.
- Delivery?

1:01:28.134 --> 1:01:31.301
Uh, yes. I'm actually
a friend of Evelyn's.

1:01:31.334 --> 1:01:32.600
Oh.

1:01:32.634 --> 1:01:35.301
Oh, Music. Music.

1:01:35.334 --> 1:01:37.200
Music, come sit down.

1:01:37.234 --> 1:01:38.434
Just sit right there.

1:01:38.467 --> 1:01:39.501
Sorry.

1:01:39.534 --> 1:01:40.900
- Uh...
- Okay, so...

1:01:40.933 --> 1:01:42.234
What are you looking for?

1:01:42.267 --> 1:01:45.234
We're looking for Percocet,
morphine, Dilaudid and Oxycontin.

1:01:45.267 --> 1:01:47.567
I have some of those,
but I don't have all of them.

1:01:47.601 --> 1:01:49.067
Actually, that's
really expensive art.

1:01:49.100 --> 1:01:50.467
- Oh. Oh, yes. Sorry.
- It's not...

1:01:50.501 --> 1:01:51.900
Don't hold on.

1:01:51.933 --> 1:01:53.267
Yeah. No, she's fine.
She's fine.

1:01:53.301 --> 1:01:55.134
We got it. We got it.
Let's just...

1:01:55.167 --> 1:01:57.534
Let's just... Okay.
Sorry. That's, like, fake hair.

1:01:57.567 --> 1:01:59.534
Sit down now.

1:01:59.567 --> 1:02:01.601
All right,
we're almost out of here.

1:02:01.634 --> 1:02:03.367
All right. How much do you need?

1:02:03.401 --> 1:02:04.501
Because I have only...

1:02:06.367 --> 1:02:07.367
Is that a Sia wig?

1:02:08.334 --> 1:02:10.100
Sia? No.

1:02:10.134 --> 1:02:11.367
- Is she here?
- No.

1:02:11.401 --> 1:02:13.100
Who's that? Drug dealer?

1:02:13.134 --> 1:02:15.234
- I...
- Drug dealer, is that you?

1:02:15.267 --> 1:02:16.833
Are you the drug dealer?

1:02:18.100 --> 1:02:19.833
Yes. Hi.

1:02:21.034 --> 1:02:23.034
Can I be of service?

1:02:23.067 --> 1:02:24.401
- Hi.
- Hi.

1:02:24.434 --> 1:02:26.167
- Hi.
- I, uh...

1:02:26.200 --> 1:02:27.267
She's the drug dealer.

1:02:27.301 --> 1:02:29.100
Yeah,
she's the drug dealer.

1:02:29.134 --> 1:02:31.334
Evelyn says you're,
uh, an angel of drugs.

1:02:31.367 --> 1:02:34.200
Yeah. And you're having a party?

1:02:34.234 --> 1:02:35.601
No. Oh, no.

1:02:35.634 --> 1:02:39.134
Those days are... Whoop!
Um, we're doing charity now. That's right.

1:02:39.167 --> 1:02:41.867
You know what we're gonna do
with the drugs we buy from you?

1:02:41.900 --> 1:02:44.367
We're gonna send them to Haiti
'cause there's been an earthquake.

1:02:44.401 --> 1:02:45.900
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

1:02:45.933 --> 1:02:49.134
All these buildings fell down and
children's bones were dislocated and...

1:02:49.167 --> 1:02:50.200
It's really sad.

1:02:50.234 --> 1:02:51.900
Yeah. Now they're trying
to put them back together,

1:02:51.933 --> 1:02:53.100
and they've only got Tylenol.

1:02:53.134 --> 1:02:56.134
There's all this red tape,
even the Red Cross can't get in.

1:02:56.167 --> 1:02:59.134
And that's where you come in.
I'm gonna buy a shitload of pain meds

1:02:59.167 --> 1:03:01.234
and put them
on my private plane.

1:03:02.501 --> 1:03:05.301
Charity. Yep. It's a good day
for a drug dealer, isn't it?

1:03:05.334 --> 1:03:08.301
So whatever you can
get before tomorrow, we'll buy.

1:03:08.334 --> 1:03:09.833
- All right?
- Really?

1:03:09.867 --> 1:03:11.267
- Yep.
- Okay.

1:03:11.301 --> 1:03:12.833
Popstars Without Borders.

So it's an entirely new system.

Each customer gets a color,

1:05:38.267 --> 1:05:41.933
each bag gets a code name
and a location.

1:05:41.967 --> 1:05:43.334
Uh-huh.

1:05:43.367 --> 1:05:45.601
It's called Kaizen,
Japanese philosophy of business efficiency.

1:05:45.634 --> 1:05:48.100
And I am nailing it.
I feel like I'm just crushing it.

1:05:48.134 --> 1:05:50.167
- Great.
- I feel like I have it down.

1:05:50.200 --> 1:05:51.234
- Rudy?
- Yeah?

1:05:51.267 --> 1:05:53.434
I need 100, 100 and 500.

1:05:54.900 --> 1:05:57.267
And can you front me
for the time being?

1:06:00.867 --> 1:06:02.567
I don't know.

1:06:02.601 --> 1:06:04.134
- Rudy?
- Yeah.

1:06:04.167 --> 1:06:06.134
- Baby, baby, baby.
- A hundred and 100 and...

1:06:07.601 --> 1:06:08.933
This isn't gonna end well.

1:06:10.200 --> 1:06:11.334
Oh, Rudy.

1:06:13.067 --> 1:06:14.967
I thought you were my friend.

1:06:18.100 --> 1:06:19.100
Okay.

1:06:23.401 --> 1:06:25.034
Okay. Here.

1:06:25.067 --> 1:06:28.833
Now, I know
that you're playing me,

1:06:30.534 --> 1:06:33.300
but if you're thinking
about leaving town

1:06:33.334 --> 1:06:37.234
or skipping out on me
in any way, don't.

1:06:39.234 --> 1:06:40.933
I'll get it

1:06:40.967 --> 1:06:43.800
and then I am out.

1:06:47.100 --> 1:06:48.134
Thank you.

1:06:49.100 --> 1:06:50.601
- What?
- Hmm?

1:06:50.634 --> 1:06:52.900
Did you just ask me about my...
What did you say?

1:06:52.933 --> 1:06:54.900
Did you ask me about this?

1:06:54.933 --> 1:06:57.267
Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you
said, "You had a cool outfit on."

1:06:57.301 --> 1:06:58.833
I'm so sorry.
That's so embarrassing.

1:06:58.867 --> 1:07:00.100
- It looks great.
- Oh. This?

1:07:00.134 --> 1:07:02.100
- Yeah. You look...
- Why would you even do that?

1:07:02.134 --> 1:07:03.434
I don't know. I don't know.
I don't know.

1:07:03.467 --> 1:07:05.401
I guess, oh.
It came with a matching hat.

1:07:05.434 --> 1:07:07.301
But I'm, like,
"Don't do it, Rudy."

1:07:07.334 --> 1:07:09.367
- Because I just... It's too much, right?
- Totally.

1:07:09.401 --> 1:07:10.434
Too much. It's too much.
Too much.

1:07:10.467 --> 1:07:12.167
Too much. I know.
So I knew it would be too much.

1:07:12.200 --> 1:07:13.434
Can you do me a favor,
by the way?

1:07:13.467 --> 1:07:17.100
Since you're in my debt,
could you please deliver this for me?

1:07:17.134 --> 1:07:21.933
- What's this?
- That is Triomune.

1:07:21.967 --> 1:07:25.867
Ah, is that, like,
what the kids are doing these days?

1:07:25.900 --> 1:07:27.501
It's what the kids
with HIV are doing.

1:07:27.534 --> 1:07:29.234
It's an emerging market.

1:07:29.267 --> 1:07:32.067
Oh, I feel...
I feel like an ass.

1:07:32.100 --> 1:07:33.701
That stuff,
that stuff I just gave you

1:07:33.734 --> 1:07:37.167
is probably the only reason why I'm
getting into heaven. You know what I mean?

1:07:38.467 --> 1:07:40.200
<i>Hey.</i>

1:07:40.233 --> 1:07:43.000
<i>Hey, you disappeared
on me the other night.</i>

1:07:43.034 --> 1:07:45.067
Um, I have a couple
of errands I'm gonna run,

1:07:45.100 --> 1:07:48.301
and then I'm gonna see you at the...
The tournament.

1:08:47.967 --> 1:08:49.200
Hey.

1:08:49.234 --> 1:08:52.200
Zu, where do you think
you're going?

1:08:52.234 --> 1:08:54.067
Sorry I'm late, George.

1:08:54.100 --> 1:08:55.933
You're three hours late.

1:08:55.967 --> 1:08:59.567
I know, I know. I got... I...
I got one more thing I need to do.

1:08:59.601 --> 1:09:02.267
Just one more thing.
I'll be super quick, George.

1:09:02.301 --> 1:09:04.401
You come take care of her
right now.

1:09:04.434 --> 1:09:06.100
- Please.
- Right now.

1:09:08.301 --> 1:09:10.134
Come on. Keep up, Music.

1:09:11.467 --> 1:09:12.467
Rainbow.

1:09:13.200 --> 1:09:14.200
Rainbow.

1:09:15.167 --> 1:09:16.501
- Rainbow.
- Oh, God.

1:09:18.133 --> 1:09:22.100
Okay, one rainbow.
One rainbow, Music.

1:09:22.134 --> 1:09:23.800
And we gotta get out of here.

1:09:31.367 --> 1:09:32.367
All right.

1:09:34.200 --> 1:09:35.334
Thank you.

1:09:36.267 --> 1:09:37.267
What are you doing?

1:09:38.034 --> 1:09:39.100
What are you doing?

1:09:39.134 --> 1:09:41.467
No, no, no, no, no!
Ew! Ew! Music!

1:09:41.501 --> 1:09:43.467
Get up. Get up.

1:09:43.501 --> 1:09:45.134
Come here.

1:09:45.167 --> 1:09:46.334
Spit it out.

1:09:46.367 --> 1:09:48.000
Spit it out, spit it out.

1:09:48.034 --> 1:09:49.401
Spit it out. Ugh.

1:09:50.634 --> 1:09:52.434
So disgusting.

1:10:02.000 --> 1:10:03.134
Ah!

1:10:05.234 --> 1:10:06.267
What's the matter?

1:10:06.301 --> 1:10:08.067
Okay, okay.

1:10:11.601 --> 1:10:16.034
Oh, oh, oh. No, no, no.
Don't do that. Don't do that.

1:10:16.067 --> 1:10:17.933
- Is she allergic?
- I don't know.

1:10:19.601 --> 1:10:20.800
Okay.

1:10:22.334 --> 1:10:25.000
Come on, let's get up. Let's get up.
Let's go. Let's go.

1:10:25.034 --> 1:10:27.900
Let's go, come on. Shh.

1:10:27.933 --> 1:10:30.200
I need help. I need help.
Please, someone.

1:10:30.234 --> 1:10:33.534
Please help me. Help, please!

1:10:33.567 --> 1:10:36.367
- I need Epi, 0.2 milligram.
- She's allergic.

1:10:36.401 --> 1:10:38.567
It's okay, it's okay.

1:10:39.367 --> 1:10:40.401
Oh, my God!

1:10:42.301 --> 1:10:43.967

1:10:44.000 --> 1:10:48.367

Felix Chang vs Tanner Rojas.</i>

1:10:48.401 --> 1:10:50.301
<i>Beginners level, three rounds.</i>

1:10:54.167 --> 1:10:56.234
All right, listen, Picasso,

1:10:56.267 --> 1:10:59.067
sometimes we have to be places
we don't want to be

1:10:59.100 --> 1:11:00.833
and do things
we don't want to do.

1:11:02.067 --> 1:11:03.534
Just a few quick rounds.

1:11:06.501 --> 1:11:08.167
I don't know
what you are doing here,

1:11:08.200 --> 1:11:10.200
or what you are trying to prove

1:11:10.234 --> 1:11:12.000
or to whom.

1:11:12.034 --> 1:11:14.167
But you are a good kid,

1:11:14.200 --> 1:11:16.401
and I'm proud of you
just for showing up.

1:11:16.434 --> 1:11:17.867
You can do this.

1:11:19.534 --> 1:11:20.933
Just stay inside on him.

1:11:20.967 --> 1:11:23.034
If he can't reach you,
he can't hit you.

1:11:23.067 --> 1:11:25.167
All right? You've got this.
You can do this.

1:11:45.601 --> 1:11:48.200
This is a good boy.

1:11:48.234 --> 1:11:50.100
Fight!
Knock him down!

1:11:50.134 --> 1:11:51.434
Knock him out!

1:11:54.067 --> 1:11:56.234
I thought she was gonna die.

1:11:56.267 --> 1:11:58.434
Well, she did have
an EpiPen in her pouch.

1:11:58.467 --> 1:12:00.933
Also, I had a question
about your insurance forms.

1:12:00.967 --> 1:12:02.467
You left your occupation blank.

1:12:04.000 --> 1:12:05.301
Yeah, um...

1:12:11.234 --> 1:12:12.501
Oh, no.

1:12:12.534 --> 1:12:14.167
Oh, no.

1:12:14.200 --> 1:12:15.833
No, no!

1:12:16.501 --> 1:12:17.534
Damn it!

1:12:18.501 --> 1:12:20.467
Shit.

1:12:20.501 --> 1:12:22.933
We're fine.
Just looking for my bag.

1:12:24.501 --> 1:12:25.534
I'm sorry.

1:12:33.267 --> 1:12:35.401
Hey, uh, where are you?

1:12:36.567 --> 1:12:38.867
Been trying to call. Um...

1:12:40.401 --> 1:12:41.567
Call me back.

1:12:44.867 --> 1:12:47.100

1:13:24.501 --> 1:13:25.567
Go to bed.

1:14:01.601 --> 1:14:02.900
<i>I'm confused.</i>

1:14:05.601 --> 1:14:08.467
<i>Just go over there

1:14:08.501 --> 1:14:10.534
<i>"I'm totally broke.</i>

1:14:10.567 --> 1:14:12.467
<i>"Almost killed my sister."</i>

1:14:17.267 --> 1:14:20.267
<i>I'm gonna go over there,
I'm gonna sign him up.</i>

1:14:20.301 --> 1:14:22.234
<i>We're a great team.</i>

1:14:22.267 --> 1:14:24.933
<i>Just say that really loud.</i>

1:14:24.967 --> 1:14:27.434
<i>All right,
call your granny. Here I come.</i>

1:14:30.567 --> 1:14:31.567
Ebo.

1:14:34.367 --> 1:14:36.833
I can hear you in there.

1:14:36.867 --> 1:14:38.534
I'll just wait until you answer.

1:14:44.000 --> 1:14:46.267
I'm gonna sit and wait.

1:14:46.301 --> 1:14:48.501
I'm gonna sit and wait
until you answer the door.

1:14:49.501 --> 1:14:50.933
Ebo.

1:14:51.900 --> 1:14:53.501
Ebo.

1:14:53.534 --> 1:14:55.100
Oh.

1:14:55.134 --> 1:14:56.867
Ebo.

1:14:56.900 --> 1:14:58.601
Zu, what are
you doing here?

1:14:58.634 --> 1:15:00.200
Listen, no.

1:15:00.234 --> 1:15:02.067
- Come on.
- I'm good.

1:15:02.100 --> 1:15:03.367
- Zu.
- Oh.

1:15:03.401 --> 1:15:05.267
Those were some serious samples.

1:15:05.301 --> 1:15:08.401
- I'm sorry that I didn't call you.
- Yes.

1:15:08.434 --> 1:15:11.467
Okay? I... I wanted to talk
about this in person.

1:15:11.501 --> 1:15:12.933
Exactly.

1:15:12.967 --> 1:15:15.900
- I just, I feel like...
- I wanted to...

1:15:15.933 --> 1:15:17.234
This might be too much for me.

1:15:17.267 --> 1:15:19.134
I don't...

1:15:19.167 --> 1:15:20.967
- Yeah.
- I don't think I can do this.

1:15:21.000 --> 1:15:22.267
Ex... Yes.

1:15:24.234 --> 1:15:25.367
Exactly.

1:15:28.267 --> 1:15:30.967
It's exactly that's, uh...

1:15:35.867 --> 1:15:38.933
Are you... Are you drunk?

1:15:38.967 --> 1:15:41.401
No. Maybe.

1:15:44.134 --> 1:15:46.200
- Yes.
- Okay, I think...

1:15:47.867 --> 1:15:51.100
Listen, here's the thing.
I don't even care about AIDS.

1:15:51.134 --> 1:15:52.301
I don't care.

1:15:53.267 --> 1:15:54.501
We should get you home.

1:15:54.534 --> 1:15:56.467
- I am home.
- Please.

1:15:56.501 --> 1:15:59.567
This is my home.
This is the hallway of the home.

1:15:59.601 --> 1:16:01.267
Where is Music?

1:16:01.301 --> 1:16:03.100
- Who is watching her?
- She's sleeping.

1:16:03.134 --> 1:16:05.067
She's fine.

1:16:05.100 --> 1:16:07.601
She can take care of herself.

1:16:07.634 --> 1:16:09.367
No, she can't!

1:16:09.401 --> 1:16:12.401
God, why don't you care about...

1:16:14.434 --> 1:16:15.634
It's okay.

1:16:15.668 --> 1:16:18.301
- No, why don't you care about me?
- I do care about you.

1:16:18.334 --> 1:16:21.301
- That's why I think you should go home and to sleep.
- You're not...

1:16:21.334 --> 1:16:22.301
- Okay?
- No.

1:16:22.334 --> 1:16:24.100
- Let's get you home.
- I don't wanna go home.

1:16:24.134 --> 1:16:25.567
Is everything okay out here?

1:16:25.601 --> 1:16:27.401
Yeah, everything's fine.

1:16:27.434 --> 1:16:30.134
Why don't you go
into your little laundry and...

1:16:30.167 --> 1:16:31.467
Go do some laundry.

1:16:33.967 --> 1:16:36.534
This is not going the way
that I wanted it. This...

1:16:36.567 --> 1:16:37.900
- Zu...
- Just...

1:16:37.933 --> 1:16:39.867
- Whoa, whoa, come on now.
- Hey.

1:16:39.900 --> 1:16:41.434

Please, please, please.
I'm on probation, sir.

1:16:52.234 --> 1:16:53.367

This is the third floor.

1:31:54.401 --> 1:31:56.000
Music is gonna be sleeping here.

1:32:09.534 --> 1:32:11.000
Uh...

1:32:11.034 --> 1:32:15.067
It's small, I admit,
but we like to stay cozy.

1:32:15.100 --> 1:32:19.000
Yeah, is there a lot of people
around just to make sure she's okay?

1:32:19.034 --> 1:32:21.601
What happens
if she hurts herself?

1:32:21.634 --> 1:32:24.401
Well, we do the best we can
with what we have.

1:32:24.434 --> 1:32:28.334
There will be some adjusting, but after
a while she will love it like a home.

1:32:34.601 --> 1:32:35.867
Um...

1:32:38.034 --> 1:32:39.267
Sorry, my brain's...

1:32:41.067 --> 1:32:42.200
Any other questions?

1:32:42.234 --> 1:32:43.234
No.

1:32:44.334 --> 1:32:45.800
No, we're good, thanks.

1:32:49.434 --> 1:32:52.367
It's for the best
in the long run.

1:32:58.501 --> 1:32:59.967
Don't go.

1:33:02.534 --> 1:33:03.967
Sit down now.

1:33:29.634 --> 1:33:31.900
Sis, don't go.

1:34:07.000 --> 1:34:09.000
And now,
the brother of the groom.

1:34:17.301 --> 1:34:21.367
I'd like to offer something
to the beautiful couple.

1:34:24.601 --> 1:34:25.833
I love you both.

1:34:27.467 --> 1:34:28.867
And I want you to be happy.

1:34:32.367 --> 1:34:35.967

1:34:43.434 --> 1:34:44.567

1:34:46.467 --> 1:34:48.467
But one thing I am sure of,

1:34:50.167 --> 1:34:51.800
I'm happy for you.

1:35:01.967 --> 1:35:05.301
Hi, I need to talk to you.

1:35:07.000 --> 1:35:08.434
- What are you doing here?
- I, uh...

1:35:10.200 --> 1:35:11.434
I quit my job.

1:35:13.967 --> 1:35:15.134
And I'm sober.

1:35:18.067 --> 1:35:21.467
I've been sober
ever since that night.

1:35:21.501 --> 1:35:23.967
Every time I think about that
night, I just wanna die.

1:35:24.000 --> 1:35:26.000
- Forget that.
- No, we don't forget that.

1:35:26.034 --> 1:35:28.067
And I know
I'm not supposed to say this,

1:35:28.867 --> 1:35:31.167
that I'm never
not gonna be sober,

1:35:31.200 --> 1:35:33.367
but I'll never
not be sober again.

1:35:35.301 --> 1:35:38.200
I almost gave Music away
to strangers today.

1:35:41.167 --> 1:35:42.200
Almost left her.

1:35:44.933 --> 1:35:46.100
I'm not gonna do that.

1:35:47.267 --> 1:35:49.334
I'm gonna stay
and I'm going to help her

1:35:49.367 --> 1:35:50.933
just like she helps me

1:35:53.034 --> 1:35:54.234
because I love her.

1:35:55.867 --> 1:35:59.000
And I think that's what you
do when you love someone.

1:35:59.034 --> 1:36:02.334
And I'm actually learning
how to love someone.
