WEBVTT

00:00.398 --> 00:01.069
(school bell ringing)

00:01.091 --> 00:02.926
KURT:
<i>Look at her.</i>

00:02.960 --> 00:06.203
<i>This class is supposed to be</i>
<i>Free Sing... for everyone...</i>

00:06.221 --> 00:07.921
<i>but Rachel</i>
<i>hasn't stopped screeching</i>

00:07.939 --> 00:10.608
<i>like a third-rate Maria Callas</i>
<i>since the bell rang.</i>

00:10.642 --> 00:12.943
<i>Because I'm her best friend,</i>
<i>I can say this...</i>

00:12.978 --> 00:14.645
<i>Rachel's always been</i>
<i>a little insufferable,</i>

00:14.696 --> 00:17.615
<i>but ever since she won</i>
<i>Winter Showcase,</i>

00:17.649 --> 00:19.533
<i>her ego and behavior</i>
<i>are out of control.</i>

00:19.568 --> 00:20.934
<i>At home she uses up</i>
<i>all the hot water,</i>

00:20.952 --> 00:22.153
<i>leaves rings in the tub,</i>

00:22.204 --> 00:23.654
<i>and don't get me started</i>

00:23.705 --> 00:26.440
<i>on the hair extensions</i>
<i>clogging the sink.</i>

00:26.458 --> 00:28.376
<i>At school</i>
<i>she eschews my company</i>

00:28.410 --> 00:30.661
<i>and instead surrounds herself</i>
<i>with easily awed sycophants.</i>

00:30.712 --> 00:32.963
Oh, my God, Rachel.

00:32.998 --> 00:36.384
BroadwayWorld.com is saying
that the long-rumored revival

00:36.418 --> 00:39.637
of <i>Funny Girl</i> is finally
happening this season.

00:39.671 --> 00:40.805
You have to audition.

00:40.839 --> 00:42.056
I couldn't.

00:42.090 --> 00:43.624
Okay, there is only
one Fanny Brice,

00:43.642 --> 00:46.310
and that is
the Ms. Barbra Streisand.

00:46.345 --> 00:48.396
But you're
Barbra's heir apparent.

00:49.981 --> 00:51.799
(phone ringing)

00:51.817 --> 00:53.967
You gonna get that?
<i>On some level.</i>

00:53.985 --> 00:55.152
<i>I always knew</i>
<i>this would happen...</i>

00:55.187 --> 00:56.970
<i>that, as Rachel's star rose,</i>

00:56.988 --> 00:59.907
<i>so, too, would her prima donna-</i>
<i>like tendencies.</i>

00:59.941 --> 01:01.776
(cheering)

01:03.528 --> 01:05.495
<i>Yes, it's become clear to me:</i>

01:05.530 --> 01:06.864
<i>This Sarah Brightman</i>
<i>in training</i>

01:06.915 --> 01:09.083
<i>needs to be knocked down</i>
<i>a few pegs,</i>

01:09.117 --> 01:11.118
<i>and I'm the only one</i>
<i>who can do it.</i>

<font color="#40bfff">www.Addic7ed.com</font>

01:14.056 --> 01:15.756
I can't do this,
I can't do this.

01:15.791 --> 01:17.658
There's ten days to
the wedding, and I have

01:17.676 --> 01:19.260
all these choices
to make by myself.

01:19.294 --> 01:20.994
I mean, I know Will trusts me,

01:21.012 --> 01:22.763
but I'm a Libra...
I can't do this.

01:22.798 --> 01:24.014
Well, when does he get back?

01:24.049 --> 01:25.049
End of the week,

01:25.100 --> 01:26.050
but it was a big success.

01:26.101 --> 01:27.501
Will said that they got

01:27.519 --> 01:29.053
Congress to agree to cut
federal arts funding

01:29.104 --> 01:31.505
in schools by 35% instead of 50.

01:31.523 --> 01:32.606
Pretty amazing.
Yeah.

01:32.641 --> 01:34.108
So, are you guys going
on a honeymoon

01:34.142 --> 01:35.109
or something?

01:35.143 --> 01:37.177
Um, I'm sure we will.

01:37.195 --> 01:38.946
Will keeps suggesting
Costa Rica, but,

01:38.980 --> 01:41.232
I mean, us gingers can't be
that close to the equator.

01:41.283 --> 01:42.566
Why are you asking?

01:42.617 --> 01:44.034
I just assumed
that Mr. Shue is going

01:44.069 --> 01:45.686
to want his glee club back.

01:45.704 --> 01:47.238
Well, look, I-I don't think
you need to worry

01:47.289 --> 01:48.456
about Will kicking you
out on the street,

01:48.490 --> 01:50.074
especially not after you did

01:50.125 --> 01:52.743
such an extraordinary job
while he was gone.

01:52.794 --> 01:54.361
I mean, you coached a
really inexperienced team

01:54.379 --> 01:55.629
all the way to regionals.

01:55.664 --> 01:57.531
I think
that's pretty impressive.

01:57.549 --> 01:59.032
Regionals is
a different ball game.

01:59.050 --> 02:01.034
You need these big,
brassy voices

02:01.052 --> 02:04.472
to bully the competition...
Rachel, Santana, Mercedes,

02:04.506 --> 02:06.373
even Kurt.
Blaine can do that.

02:06.391 --> 02:08.476
Yeah, but it's, it's about more
than just being able to sing.

02:08.509 --> 02:10.043
It's about the attitude,
you know?

02:10.061 --> 02:11.762
Yeah. Those kids didn't
just want to win,

02:11.813 --> 02:13.264
they wanted to crush
the competition.

02:13.315 --> 02:15.232
Well, maybe you should have
a lesson that toughens 'em up.

02:15.267 --> 02:16.817
You know, I mean,
weren't there weeks

02:16.852 --> 02:19.103
where Will had you guys
competing against each other?

02:19.154 --> 02:21.822
That's the perfect idea,
Miss Pillsbury, thank you.

02:21.857 --> 02:23.724
Very welcome.
And you can be

02:23.742 --> 02:26.277
our special celebrity
guest judge to help decide

02:26.328 --> 02:27.578
who wins.

02:27.612 --> 02:29.396
(bell ringing) Diva.

02:29.414 --> 02:30.414
FINN: So, now that we're
back in the game,

02:30.449 --> 02:32.566
we've got to come strong.

02:32.584 --> 02:34.919
Diva Week is all about finding
your inner powerhouse.

02:34.953 --> 02:36.454
Miss Pillsbury.
That's right.

02:36.505 --> 02:38.956
The Online Urban Dictionary
defines a diva as

02:39.007 --> 02:41.926
"a fierce, often temperamental
singer who comes correct.

02:41.960 --> 02:43.844
"She is not a trick-ass ho

02:43.879 --> 02:45.095
and she does not
sweat da haterz."

02:45.130 --> 02:46.764
JAKE:
Great, so I guess the guys

02:46.798 --> 02:47.965
are screwed this week.
Um...

02:48.016 --> 02:49.934
(clears throat)
Guys can be divas.

02:49.968 --> 02:51.185
EMMA: That's right, we
all have inner divas.

02:51.219 --> 02:52.770
I myself have been considered
quite a diva

02:52.804 --> 02:54.472
at many a local restaurant

02:54.523 --> 02:57.090
because I know what I want
and I will send a dish back.

02:57.108 --> 02:59.760
You all might as well just quit while
you're ahead because there are only

02:59.778 --> 03:02.262
two ways to spell Unique,
and one of them is.

03:02.280 --> 03:05.316
D-I-V-A... Diva.
M'kay? Shanté, I stay,

03:05.367 --> 03:08.969
and it will be brought, dished
out, and served and mopped up

03:09.004 --> 03:10.971
by the time <i>you</i>
even pick out a wig.

03:11.006 --> 03:15.476
Looking at you,
clocking that sadness.

03:15.510 --> 03:17.344
I have more diva in my little
finger than you have

03:17.378 --> 03:21.015
in your whole angry inch, Wade-Unique.
(laughs)

03:21.049 --> 03:23.517
Tina, you've kind of been
talking some ridiculous trash

03:23.551 --> 03:26.520
for months, unchallenged,
and that stops now.

03:26.554 --> 03:28.105
Use that finger, use that snap.

03:28.156 --> 03:29.723
Listen, guys can be divas.

03:29.741 --> 03:31.058
You guys, I'm going
to win Diva Week.

03:31.076 --> 03:33.393

that? It's because...

is how I made the manager cry
at the Cheesecake Factory...

05:36.684 --> 05:37.901
by being a diva.

05:37.952 --> 05:40.904
(bell ringing) Yay, divas.

05:40.955 --> 05:42.156
(performing vocal exercises)

05:42.190 --> 05:43.907
Oh, hey, you're awake.

05:43.958 --> 05:45.326
An hour before my alarm clock.
Oh, when you're in there,

05:45.360 --> 05:46.827
can you make me a little
tea, please, with some honey

05:46.861 --> 05:48.579
and lemon? You know, it's
really good for my throat.

05:48.630 --> 05:51.465
Sure, I'll just run down
to the store and get you some.

05:51.499 --> 05:54.084
I'll take that as a no.

05:54.135 --> 05:56.870
An incredibly rude no
that deserves an explanation.

05:56.888 --> 05:58.472
Okay, Rachel, truth time.

05:58.506 --> 06:00.540
You have been a nightmare
ever since the Winter Showcase.

06:00.558 --> 06:02.142
I knew it... it was only
a matter of time

06:02.177 --> 06:04.044
before you became jealous
of all of my success.

06:04.062 --> 06:05.679
And just when we were
getting inseparable.

06:05.713 --> 06:07.264
Oh... we became close

06:07.315 --> 06:08.515
because you became tolerable,

06:08.549 --> 06:09.716
but now you've got that weird

06:09.734 --> 06:12.152
naked boyfriend and that
weird Legion of Sycophants.

06:12.187 --> 06:13.771
Now you are like,
you're like an annoying,

06:13.822 --> 06:16.490
self-righteous Lima Rachel
on steroids.

06:16.524 --> 06:18.609
You know what? Let me give you
a little bit of truth, Kurt.

06:18.660 --> 06:20.060
Okay, the only reason
why Carmen Tibideaux

06:20.078 --> 06:21.779
even let you sing at
the Winter Showcase

06:21.830 --> 06:23.530
was because she knew that
you and I were friends.

06:23.564 --> 06:25.399
You might have won the showcase,
but my performance

06:25.417 --> 06:26.867
was the one
that everyone was talking about

06:26.901 --> 06:30.337
because I blew you away

06:30.372 --> 06:31.955
and I can do it again.

06:32.006 --> 06:33.907
Midnight Madness...

06:33.925 --> 06:35.742
you and me,
head-to-head.

06:35.760 --> 06:39.463
I wouldn't do that
if I were you, babe.

06:39.514 --> 06:41.181
Oh, why not?

06:41.216 --> 06:43.050
'Cause I already beat you once.

06:43.084 --> 06:45.302
Diva-Off sophomore year.

06:45.353 --> 06:46.720
Remember?

06:46.754 --> 06:47.971
Only because I threw it.

06:48.022 --> 06:49.423
That high "F"
in "Defying Gravity"?

06:49.441 --> 06:51.925
I can hit that baby
in my sleep.

06:51.943 --> 06:53.360
I tanked the note on purpose.

06:53.395 --> 06:54.728
Okay, why would you do that?

06:54.762 --> 06:56.096
'Cause I didn't want to win.

06:56.114 --> 06:57.564
I wanted to save my dad
the embarrassment

06:57.598 --> 06:59.400
of having his son sing
a song written for a woman.

06:59.434 --> 07:00.701
I don't believe you.

07:00.735 --> 07:01.985
Take that back.

07:02.036 --> 07:03.237
I can't... it's truth time.

07:03.271 --> 07:06.073
That was my first big win.

07:06.107 --> 07:07.774
That was the foundation
that I built

07:07.792 --> 07:09.776
all of my confidence on
for the past two years.

07:09.794 --> 07:10.994
Aw, consider it cracked.

07:11.045 --> 07:12.612
Get ready
for Diva-Off Part Two,

07:12.630 --> 07:15.249
and this time
I'm not throwing anything.

07:15.283 --> 07:17.751
Enjoy your tea.

07:17.785 --> 07:19.086
(bell ringing)

07:19.120 --> 07:20.087
(grunts)

07:20.121 --> 07:21.088
(inhales)

07:21.122 --> 07:22.756
(coughs)

07:22.790 --> 07:24.675
Here, I put together a
little cold buster kit

07:24.726 --> 07:26.593
for you.

07:26.627 --> 07:28.628
Cool, uh, how did you know?

07:28.646 --> 07:31.064
Your nose was red yesterday.

07:31.099 --> 07:34.017
Start off with cough drops,
then two packs of vitamin C,

07:34.068 --> 07:36.303
a cup of my homemade
Chinese chicken soup,

07:36.321 --> 07:37.588
and finish
with my secret weapon...

07:37.622 --> 07:38.972
nighttime cold medicine.

07:38.990 --> 07:40.140
Aw, thank you.

07:40.175 --> 07:41.442
I really appreciate
this. It's gonna

07:41.476 --> 07:43.026
have me feeling
better in no time,

07:43.077 --> 07:44.745
except for maybe the
nighttime cold medicine.

07:44.779 --> 07:46.363
Why? It's amazing.

07:46.414 --> 07:48.615
Just makes me really sleepy
and woozy, which is something

07:48.649 --> 07:50.200
I can't afford to be right now,

07:50.251 --> 07:53.287
not with Diva Week
in full swing.

07:53.321 --> 07:54.988
(clears throat)

07:55.006 --> 07:57.657
I want to be able to prove
that men can be divas, too,

07:57.675 --> 07:59.126
which is why I'm
gonna give them

07:59.160 --> 08:00.761
a full dose of some
Freddie Mercury...

08:00.795 --> 08:02.629
just to show how the
boys can really bring

08:02.663 --> 08:04.214
some diva attitude.

08:04.265 --> 08:07.718
Mr. Anderson, you find new
ways to inspire me every day.

08:07.769 --> 08:09.052
Aw. (Sniffs)
Thanks, Tina.

Santana, that was simply

12:39.628 --> 12:40.829
the greatest moment

12:40.880 --> 12:42.547
in show business history.

12:42.581 --> 12:44.582
But how come you didn't tell me
you were coming to town?

12:44.616 --> 12:46.051
You know, I think that
the better question is,

12:46.085 --> 12:47.769
why didn't you tell me
that you were dating Sam?

12:47.803 --> 12:51.222
I had just left a comment on
my favorite <i>Rizzoli & Isles</i>

12:51.257 --> 12:53.508
lesbian subtext blog
when I heard the news.

12:53.559 --> 12:55.393
One word: Bram.

12:55.428 --> 12:56.928
Gotta go, hon.

12:56.962 --> 12:58.680
Oh, and before I forget,
allow me to introduce

12:58.731 --> 13:00.965
my backup, and my girlfriend,

13:00.983 --> 13:02.183
Elaine.

13:02.234 --> 13:03.601
And by girlfriend,

13:03.635 --> 13:05.520
I mean out and proud,
lipstick-loving,

13:05.571 --> 13:07.638
AfterEllen-reading
girlfriend.

13:10.076 --> 13:12.777
(bell rings) GLEE CLUB
MEMBERS: That was so good.

13:12.811 --> 13:15.280
Okay, so if I'm gonna win
this Midnight Madness thing,

13:15.314 --> 13:19.150
which I am, then I'm gonna need
to know exactly what it is.

13:19.168 --> 13:21.036
NYADA's fight club,

13:21.087 --> 13:22.704
but singing instead of punching.

13:22.755 --> 13:24.205
Twice a year,

13:24.256 --> 13:25.707
we break into a classroom

13:25.758 --> 13:27.625
for a no-holds-barred
sing-off to the death.

13:27.659 --> 13:29.660
Winner gets ultimate
bragging rights

13:29.678 --> 13:32.497
for the rest of the time
that they're at NYADA,

13:32.515 --> 13:33.664
loser gets
shamed and humiliated.

13:33.682 --> 13:35.133
Hm. Well, then I guess

13:35.167 --> 13:36.468
I'm gonna have to beat Kurt.

13:36.502 --> 13:39.137
Oh, don't worry, you will. Hmm.

13:39.171 --> 13:41.172
We all heard about Taylor the
Latte Boy challenging you,

13:41.190 --> 13:42.173
and... it's a joke.

13:42.191 --> 13:43.341
MAN 2:
Like those outfits of his?

13:43.359 --> 13:44.675
Now, everyone knows

13:44.693 --> 13:46.227
the only reason
Hummel got in is 'cause

13:46.278 --> 13:48.113
he's Carmen's
pet turtle-face.

13:48.147 --> 13:49.347
And signing up for
Adam's Apples?

13:49.365 --> 13:50.848
He might as well
wear a sign around his neck

13:50.866 --> 13:52.016
that says, "I am pathetic",

13:52.034 --> 13:53.684
please club me to death."
Okay,

13:53.702 --> 13:55.820
Kurt earned his place here
at NYADA same as you two.

13:55.854 --> 13:57.155
Excuse me?

13:57.189 --> 13:58.239
It's okay, Rachel.

13:58.290 --> 13:59.290
I've dealt with a lot worse

13:59.325 --> 14:00.691
than bitchy gossip.

14:00.709 --> 14:03.027
However I got here,
the point is, I'm here.

14:03.045 --> 14:04.963
And me, my outfits,
and my turtle-face

14:04.997 --> 14:06.798
aren't going anywhere.

14:06.832 --> 14:08.216
We'll see about that
at Midnight Madness.

14:12.805 --> 14:15.507
(school bell rings)

14:15.541 --> 14:17.675
EMMA:
So, how did you find out?

14:17.710 --> 14:19.427
She changed her Facebook
relationship status

14:19.478 --> 14:20.645
to "Shacked up."

14:20.679 --> 14:23.098
Mine's still
"Heartbroken."

14:23.132 --> 14:24.382
I haven't been interested

14:24.400 --> 14:26.317
in other women since
Rachel and I broke up.

14:26.352 --> 14:27.552
Well, maybe it's time to be.

14:27.570 --> 14:29.487
There's a great new math sub.

14:29.522 --> 14:33.057
I know she's a little...
but... She's like 26.

14:33.075 --> 14:34.359
What do... what
do I have to offer

14:34.393 --> 14:35.360
a grown woman like that?

14:35.394 --> 14:36.995
I'm just a man-boy.

14:37.029 --> 14:38.947
I get what it feels like
to be lonely.

14:38.998 --> 14:40.949
I haven't really
felt like myself

14:40.983 --> 14:42.534
since Will's been away,
and it's kind of scary.

14:42.568 --> 14:43.952
You know, sometimes
you feel like

14:44.003 --> 14:45.203
it's the only feeling
you're ever

14:45.237 --> 14:46.571
gonna have in the world.

14:46.589 --> 14:49.007
(bell rings)

14:49.041 --> 14:50.175
And it will be,

14:50.209 --> 14:52.577
until you get back
in the saddle.

14:52.595 --> 14:54.078
Thanks, Miss Pillsbury.

14:54.096 --> 14:55.380
Honestly, you're
the only person here

14:55.414 --> 14:56.798
who can always cheer me up.

14:56.849 --> 14:58.683
Mr. Shue's a lucky guy.

14:58.717 --> 14:59.934
He really is.

15:01.554 --> 15:02.753
Oh, um, but don't just thank me.

15:02.771 --> 15:04.088
You can pay me back by, um,

15:04.106 --> 15:06.424
helping me pick
a centerpiece arrangement.

15:06.442 --> 15:07.925
Sure.
Yeah?

15:07.943 --> 15:10.361
Option number one,

15:10.396 --> 15:11.563
or...

15:11.597 --> 15:12.597
option number two.

15:14.250 --> 15:15.650
I'd go with the white one,

15:15.701 --> 15:16.934
because blue

15:16.952 --> 15:18.403
is like the color of sad,

15:18.437 --> 15:20.104
and white

15:20.122 --> 15:22.106
is the color of pure, like you.

15:22.124 --> 15:23.708
That's exactly what I thought.

15:23.742 --> 15:26.461
I'm gonna mark this
off my list.

15:31.550 --> 15:33.117
(bell rings)

15:34.637 --> 15:37.121
And I didn't even have to

15:37.139 --> 15:38.456
lay out a line of cereal

15:38.474 --> 15:39.957
for you to find me.

15:39.975 --> 15:41.292
I thought you loved Brittany.

15:41.310 --> 15:42.760
I mean, I can't
believe you're making

15:42.794 --> 15:44.345
what's going on
with me and her about you.

15:44.396 --> 15:46.464
You're naive to think
that this isn't about me.

15:46.482 --> 15:48.016
I broke up with Brittany.

15:48.067 --> 15:49.234
This is just her revenge.

15:49.268 --> 15:50.351
She could have

15:50.402 --> 15:52.353
dated anyone, boy or girl.

15:52.404 --> 15:54.805
But no. She chose you.

15:54.823 --> 15:57.108
The one person she
knew would send.

15:59.411 --> 16:00.578
Okay, you know what?
Brittany doesn't

16:00.613 --> 16:02.247
understand revenge.
Brittany is love.

16:02.281 --> 16:03.814
Listen up, Lipsy McChapstick.

16:03.832 --> 16:05.250
This is going to end.

16:05.284 --> 16:07.202
Soon as Brittany
realizes that you are

16:07.253 --> 16:09.220
the most boring human being
on the planet,

16:09.238 --> 16:11.722
and that your impressions suck.
And then what?

16:11.740 --> 16:13.942
You're... you're going
to date her again?

16:13.993 --> 16:15.410
Long distance?

16:15.444 --> 16:17.728
It didn't work, you
said it yourself.

16:17.746 --> 16:19.914
One step at a time.
First, I'm gonna

16:19.949 --> 16:22.083
cut off the Sam-sized tumor
on her heart,

16:22.117 --> 16:24.619
and then we can begin
the long, slow process

16:24.670 --> 16:27.571
of cleaning the stink
of your mediocrity off of her.

16:27.590 --> 16:30.458
I'm not letting her go
without a fight.

16:30.509 --> 16:32.910
What do you think
we're here for?

16:32.928 --> 16:36.747
To fight?
I'm not hitting a girl.

16:36.765 --> 16:39.083
Who said anything about hitting?

♪ I only know what she's like

17:44.366 --> 17:46.701

♪ When she needs me

17:46.752 --> 17:54.676
♪ Oh, how she needs me...

17:54.710 --> 18:01.832

18:25.541 --> 18:28.141

♪ Anymore.

18:34.666 --> 18:36.384
This isn't over.

18:36.418 --> 18:38.086
Look, I know
you're still into her.

18:38.137 --> 18:39.637
You can't sing like that

18:39.671 --> 18:41.422
about somebody you don't love.

18:41.473 --> 18:42.924
But she's with me now,

18:42.975 --> 18:45.042
and you know that's
the best thing for her.

18:45.060 --> 18:45.977
Just let it go.

18:48.647 --> 18:50.064
Never.

18:51.950 --> 18:53.768
(bell rings)

18:53.819 --> 18:55.403
TINA:
<i>In honor of Diva Week,</i>

18:55.437 --> 18:57.105
<i>let's just cut the crap</i>
<i>and keep it real.</i>

18:57.156 --> 18:59.557
<i>Tina Cohen-Chang</i>
<i>deserves better.</i>

18:59.575 --> 19:01.743
<i>I got upstaged yet again</i>
<i>by Santana.</i>

19:01.777 --> 19:04.395
<i>She doesn't even</i>
<i>go to school here.</i>

19:04.413 --> 19:05.413
<i>Look at him.</i>

19:05.447 --> 19:06.897
<i>He's like a precious.</i>

19:06.915 --> 19:08.666
Tiger Beat <i>Shrinky Dink</i>

19:08.700 --> 19:11.735

19:11.754 --> 19:13.254
<i>What am I doing?</i>

19:13.288 --> 19:14.422
<i>Mike would totally laugh.</i>

19:14.456 --> 19:17.258
<i>I should call Mike.</i>

19:17.292 --> 19:18.909
<i>No. I shouldn't.</i>

19:18.927 --> 19:21.512
<i>Divas don't call</i>
<i>ex-boyfriends, Tina.</i>

19:21.547 --> 19:25.683
<i>Stop being afraid</i>
<i>of going after what you want.</i>

19:25.717 --> 19:27.268
Hey, Bling-bling.

19:27.302 --> 19:29.187
Feeling better? Hey, X-Tina.
No, I am not.

19:29.221 --> 19:30.638
It's worse.

19:30.689 --> 19:32.306
My whole head feels like it's

19:32.357 --> 19:33.808
a shrink-wrapped
fist of ham.

19:33.859 --> 19:35.309
Here, I got you this.

19:35.360 --> 19:37.862
It's VapoRub.
My nana swears by it.

19:37.896 --> 19:39.947
Aw, thanks, lady.

19:39.982 --> 19:42.450
(chuckles) You're so sweet.

19:44.820 --> 19:46.204
What, what'd I say?

19:46.238 --> 19:48.039
I don't want to be sweet.

19:48.073 --> 19:49.874
I want to be the girl
that kicks in the door

19:49.908 --> 19:51.125
and makes demands

19:51.160 --> 19:52.627
and gets what she wants.

19:52.661 --> 19:53.944
But let's be honest:

19:53.962 --> 19:56.047
No one thinks "diva"
and pictures me.

19:56.081 --> 19:57.799
What are you talking about?

19:57.833 --> 19:59.783
There are tons of
badass Asian divas.

19:59.802 --> 20:01.052
Look at Lucy Liu,

20:01.086 --> 20:03.004
Bai Ling, B.D. Wong.

20:03.055 --> 20:05.306
(sniffles) Okay, (coughs)

20:05.340 --> 20:07.308
you're coming to my house
after school tonight,

20:07.342 --> 20:08.459
and we're gonna find
you the right song.

20:08.477 --> 20:09.894
We're gonna bring out your

20:09.928 --> 20:11.562
inner diva if it kills me.

20:11.597 --> 20:13.981
Aw, Blainey Days.

20:17.503 --> 20:19.304
(music playing softly)

20:22.508 --> 20:24.892
(Blaine coughs)

20:24.927 --> 20:27.762
Have you ever been with a girl?

20:27.813 --> 20:29.213
No.

20:29.231 --> 20:30.982
Perfect gold star gay.

20:31.016 --> 20:32.650
Except for that one time
where I kissed Rachel Berry.

20:32.685 --> 20:34.068
That doesn't count.

20:34.103 --> 20:35.603
Well, it's not that
I don't like girls.

20:35.654 --> 20:37.155
I love them.

20:37.189 --> 20:38.273
They're very kind
and sensitive,

20:38.324 --> 20:40.608
and their bodies are beautiful.

20:40.659 --> 20:42.893
Thank you. You know,
on behalf of girls everywhere.

20:42.911 --> 20:46.114
But loving them that way...

20:46.165 --> 20:47.248
it's not who I am.

20:47.283 --> 20:48.583
We're young.

20:48.617 --> 20:49.784
We still have time
to find ourselves.

20:49.835 --> 20:51.119
Exactly.

20:51.170 --> 20:52.903
Which is why,
Ms. Tina Cohen-Chang,

20:52.921 --> 20:55.089
you are about to find
your inner diva.

20:55.124 --> 20:56.841
I took the liberty
of making you a little

20:56.875 --> 20:58.259
playlist of some
of the classic diva songs

20:58.294 --> 20:59.260
for you to go through,

20:59.295 --> 21:00.578
but you should open the laptop...

21:00.596 --> 21:01.796
I don't want to give you
my germs.

21:05.184 --> 21:06.601
Wow.

21:06.635 --> 21:09.270
I can't believe
you went old-school diva.

21:09.305 --> 21:12.023
Cher, Aretha, Madonna.

21:12.057 --> 21:13.691
Do you really think
I can pull this off?

21:13.726 --> 21:15.276
I don't even know
what I would wear.

21:15.311 --> 21:17.445
Are you kidding me?
You would kill it.

21:17.479 --> 21:18.863
I was thinking
that we could use...

21:18.897 --> 21:19.947
(yawning):
One of those

21:19.982 --> 21:22.266
dresses from Sectionals.

21:22.284 --> 21:25.370
I'm sorry,
that-that cold medicine

21:25.404 --> 21:27.205
is really very strong.

21:27.239 --> 21:29.106
Why don't you lie down?
Okay.

21:29.124 --> 21:31.159
It's a good idea.

21:33.162 --> 21:35.546
(sighs)

21:37.800 --> 21:40.284
You know, I've been reading
a lot about divas.

21:40.302 --> 21:41.886
Mm-hmm.

21:41.920 --> 21:43.971
And the biggest thing is

21:44.006 --> 21:46.674
that they're brutally honest.

21:46.709 --> 21:51.629
And if I'm...
going to be a diva, then...

21:51.647 --> 21:54.232
I have to be honest, too.

21:54.266 --> 21:57.485
Totally.

21:57.519 --> 22:00.137
Blaine...

22:00.155 --> 22:02.657
I'm falling in love with you.

22:04.326 --> 22:07.812
And I realize that this...

22:07.830 --> 22:12.583
could be a tragic,
one-way thing.

22:12.618 --> 22:15.586
But even if we end up

22:15.621 --> 22:20.174
having just...
a sexless relationship,

22:20.209 --> 22:22.710
which many Asian girls
and gay men do...

22:22.761 --> 22:24.345
(laughs)

22:24.380 --> 22:26.798
...it'd be worth it.

22:29.134 --> 22:31.719
So please say something here
before I die.

22:31.770 --> 22:33.504
(laughs)

22:33.522 --> 22:35.523
Blaine?

22:37.000 --> 22:43.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

22:51.874 --> 22:54.242
(snoring softly)

23:12.060 --> 23:14.846
(snoring softly)

23:27.109 --> 23:30.278
(sniffles)

23:45.544 --> 23:47.128
MAN:
Right over there.

23:47.179 --> 23:49.079
Guys, gather some chairs up.

23:49.097 --> 23:50.681
Make a semicircle.

23:50.716 --> 23:52.934
Oh, we have five minutes.

23:56.138 --> 23:58.606
Welcome to Midnight Madness.

23:58.640 --> 24:00.274
We all know the rules.

24:00.309 --> 24:02.143
One song at a time, two singers

24:02.194 --> 24:06.113
per song. If you
go flat, you lose.

24:06.148 --> 24:08.816
Now, the playing space
has been split into two.

24:08.867 --> 24:10.151
One side per competitor.

24:10.202 --> 24:12.370
After the song,

24:12.404 --> 24:14.121
I will give you the signal,

24:14.156 --> 24:16.106
and you stand
with whoever you think won.

24:16.124 --> 24:17.792
Majority rules.

24:17.826 --> 24:20.962
The group's decision
is final. No appeal.

24:20.996 --> 24:24.382
No mercy,
and only silent applause.

24:24.416 --> 24:26.801
This is not a performance.

24:26.835 --> 24:29.220
This is a blood sport.

24:29.254 --> 24:31.506
First up:

24:31.557 --> 24:33.224
Rachel Berry versus Kurt Hummel.

24:41.149 --> 24:43.968
Now, the song
you will be competing with

24:43.986 --> 24:45.820
is "Bring Him Home,"
from <i>Les Miz.</i>

24:45.854 --> 24:47.855
You guys know it?
Mm-hmm.

24:47.906 --> 24:49.824
Per Midnight Madness protocol,

24:49.858 --> 24:51.576
since Kurt challenged Rachel,

24:51.610 --> 24:54.662
he will be going first.

24:56.865 --> 24:59.584

28:28.376 --> 28:29.744
Thank you.

28:29.795 --> 28:31.962
Okay, make your choice.

28:39.671 --> 28:42.056
All right.

28:42.090 --> 28:44.225
And the winner
by the closest margin

28:44.259 --> 28:47.812
in Midnight Madness history

28:47.846 --> 28:49.146
is Mr. Kurt Hummel.

28:49.181 --> 28:50.981
(laughs)

28:52.567 --> 28:54.185
(laughs)

28:58.440 --> 29:01.993
(school bell rings) What is
with you Glee Club ex-pats?

29:02.027 --> 29:03.611
Don't any of you have jobs?

29:03.662 --> 29:05.630
You have to have some source
of income

29:05.664 --> 29:07.715
so you can pay the
staff of scientists

29:07.766 --> 29:10.601
who service your teleporters
that you all clearly own,

29:10.636 --> 29:12.804
since you're constantly
showing up here.

29:12.838 --> 29:15.005
I have a light schedule
this semester.

29:15.024 --> 29:17.508
Do you not remember
who got you that scholarship

29:17.543 --> 29:19.227
to Louisville?
Your coach is

29:19.278 --> 29:20.645
sending me weekly reports,

29:20.679 --> 29:22.230
and you dropped out a month ago.

29:22.281 --> 29:23.681
I'm sorry.
I hated it there.

29:23.699 --> 29:25.233
Everyone thought
that I was being a bitch

29:25.284 --> 29:26.951
when all I was doing
was being brutally honest

29:26.985 --> 29:29.120
with people. Look,
please don't tell my mom.

29:29.154 --> 29:30.671
Oh, I can't.
I don't speak Spanish.

29:30.706 --> 29:32.356
Let's face facts.

29:32.374 --> 29:33.741
I need an heir apparent,

29:33.792 --> 29:35.293
and I need someone
as mean as I am.

29:35.327 --> 29:37.361
Wait. So,
are you offering me a job?

29:37.396 --> 29:39.029
Finn Hudson took over
the Glee Club.

29:39.048 --> 29:40.665
Why can't you take over
my Cheerios!?

29:40.699 --> 29:42.667
Besides, you've always been
my favorite.

29:42.701 --> 29:44.034
This is an amazing offer.

29:44.053 --> 29:45.470
And with the money
that my mom gave me

29:45.504 --> 29:46.754
for New York, I could buy

29:46.789 --> 29:48.656
a McMansion in Lima Heights.

29:48.690 --> 29:51.175
And plus,
I'd be close to Brittany.

29:51.209 --> 29:53.261
Well, why don't you let me
know by the end of the week?

29:53.312 --> 29:55.012
I have Paula Abdul coming in
to interview as a backup,

29:55.046 --> 29:56.431
and whenever I cancel
too late with her,

29:56.482 --> 29:57.815
she tends to hit the pills.

29:57.850 --> 30:01.686
(bell ringing)

30:01.720 --> 30:04.021
(quiet, indistinct voices,
distorted sound)

30:08.327 --> 30:10.778
Amazing. Tay-tay,
I was just telling Artie

30:10.829 --> 30:12.280
how awesome I thought...

30:12.331 --> 30:14.165
Would you excuse us, please, Artie?
But, uh...

30:14.199 --> 30:16.584
Oh.

30:18.036 --> 30:19.787
Is everything okay?

30:19.838 --> 30:21.506
Oh, the chicken soup
you made me... magic.

30:21.540 --> 30:22.874
I feel great today!

30:22.908 --> 30:24.292
You want to know why?
Because of me.

30:24.343 --> 30:25.877
Because I took care of you.
Oh, and I guess

30:25.911 --> 30:27.795
I used most of this.
I don't know how that happened,

30:27.846 --> 30:29.380
but it's all gone. Sorry.

30:30.766 --> 30:33.217
Wait. Are you mad?
Look,

30:33.251 --> 30:35.636
I give you all
of my heart, gladly.

30:35.687 --> 30:37.555
And I love hanging
out with you, Blaine.

30:37.589 --> 30:39.190
I love...

30:39.224 --> 30:41.526
It's sad because you don't see

30:41.560 --> 30:43.094
that it's me that
gives you that support.

30:43.128 --> 30:44.479
Why are you acting
so pissed off?

30:44.530 --> 30:46.230
Because I get it now.

30:46.264 --> 30:47.732
A diva doesn't settle for less
than what she wants,

30:47.766 --> 30:49.233
and she won't apologize
for wanting it.

30:49.267 --> 30:50.701
And I can't get that here,
so next time,

don't come crawling back to me.

30:52.103 --> 30:53.538
I'm all out of soup.

30:53.572 --> 30:56.874
That seems a little... crazy.

30:56.909 --> 30:58.826
No.

30:58.877 --> 31:01.996
That seems a little
Tina Cohen-Chang. Respect.

Tina.

33:23.021 --> 33:24.088
EMMA: Wow.
FINN: Wow.

33:24.106 --> 33:25.389
(cheering, whooping) I just...

33:25.423 --> 33:26.357
I can't even...

33:26.391 --> 33:27.725
That was the most...

33:27.759 --> 33:29.226
Don't even worry about it.

33:30.696 --> 33:32.530
FINN (laughs):
Okay.

33:32.564 --> 33:34.431
Feel that fire.

33:34.449 --> 33:35.766
I've been singing
the <i>Les Miz</i> score

33:35.784 --> 33:36.934
since I was in second grade.

33:36.952 --> 33:38.235
Literally the entire score.

33:38.269 --> 33:40.538
It was just dumb luck that that
was the song that got chosen.

33:40.572 --> 33:41.989
I know you feel conflicted
about winning,

33:42.040 --> 33:43.607
but you won because
you're an incredible singer.

33:43.625 --> 33:45.042
Oh, my God, Kurt.

33:45.077 --> 33:46.661
Everyone is buzzing about your
triumph at Midnight Madness.

33:46.712 --> 33:48.946
Not since Judy played the
Palace, they're saying.

33:48.964 --> 33:51.115
A bunch of us are signing up
for the <i>Funny Girl</i> open call,

33:51.133 --> 33:53.417
then getting rush tickets
to see <i>Mamma Mia!</i>

33:53.451 --> 33:54.552
You have to come with.

33:54.586 --> 33:56.787
I don't think so.

33:56.805 --> 33:58.339
I think you both
are shallow and obnoxious.

33:58.390 --> 34:00.257
And I think the only reason
why you run around

34:00.291 --> 34:02.009
kissing everyone's ass
is because you know

34:02.060 --> 34:03.060
you'll never make it
on your own.

34:03.095 --> 34:04.395
And another thing.

34:04.429 --> 34:06.564
If you say one more nasty thing
about Adam's Apples,

34:06.598 --> 34:09.016
I will challenge you
to the next Midnight Madness,

34:09.067 --> 34:11.068
and we all know how that ends.

34:15.639 --> 34:16.806
That's very impressive.

34:18.944 --> 34:21.645
Um, give me a second.

34:21.663 --> 34:23.614
Hey, Rachel.

34:23.648 --> 34:25.081
I don't know if you heard,
but apparently the revival

34:25.117 --> 34:26.650
of <i>Funny Girl</i> is having
open auditions.

34:26.668 --> 34:27.818
Do you want to go with me?

34:27.835 --> 34:29.485
You should try out, Kurt.

34:29.504 --> 34:32.322
You'd be an amazing
Fanny Brice.

34:33.992 --> 34:36.092

34:38.650 --> 34:42.112
Winning dinner for two
at Red Rooster Express Suites...

McKinley High School.

34:44.449 --> 34:46.650
Diva Award goes to...

34:46.668 --> 34:48.753
If it's Santana, I swear...

34:48.788 --> 34:51.489
(drumroll)

34:51.507 --> 34:53.458
BOTH:
Tina Cohen-Chang!

34:53.492 --> 34:56.928
(cheering, whooping)

34:56.963 --> 34:58.830
(excited chattering)

35:01.166 --> 35:03.218
She never wins anything.

35:03.269 --> 35:06.221
(cheering continues)

35:06.272 --> 35:07.973
(whooping) Tina!

35:08.007 --> 35:10.174
Tina!
Tina!

35:10.193 --> 35:13.445
(whooping, cheering)

35:13.479 --> 35:15.146
(bell ringing)

35:16.365 --> 35:18.066
(clears throat)

35:18.117 --> 35:21.786
Uh, no diva performance
is complete without flowers.

35:21.821 --> 35:23.154
Oh, how sweet.

35:23.188 --> 35:24.623
Literally.

35:24.657 --> 35:26.408
Well, no one deserved to win
this week more than you.

35:26.459 --> 35:27.742
I've been waiting
for people to finally see

35:27.793 --> 35:30.245
the epic diva that
is Ms. Tina Cohen-Chang.

35:30.296 --> 35:31.746
(chuckles softly)

35:31.797 --> 35:34.966
I also owe you an apology.

35:35.001 --> 35:37.502
I'm sorry if I've been
ungrateful this week.

35:37.536 --> 35:38.920
The truth is, I wouldn't have
survived it without you.

35:38.971 --> 35:40.338
That little
cold buster kit you made me,

35:40.372 --> 35:42.090
it not only annihilated my cold,

35:42.141 --> 35:45.176
but it made me realize
that you are

35:45.210 --> 35:48.013
the most important person to me
at this school right now.

35:49.482 --> 35:52.684
And I haven't felt this close
to anyone in a long time.

35:52.718 --> 35:56.554
You have no idea how long I've
waited to hear you say that.

35:56.572 --> 35:59.724
I have a proposition for you.

35:59.742 --> 36:02.994
Will you be my date to
Mr. Shue's wedding next week?

36:03.029 --> 36:04.446
Yes.

36:04.497 --> 36:06.081
(laughs) Of course.

36:07.366 --> 36:10.669
(bell ringing)

36:13.506 --> 36:15.173
Shiva is officially over.

36:15.207 --> 36:16.574
You have an audition
for <i>Funny Girl</i>

36:16.609 --> 36:17.876
three weeks from today.

36:17.910 --> 36:20.178
I went down to the open call
and got us the last slots.

36:20.212 --> 36:22.246
I'm not trying out.

36:22.265 --> 36:24.633
Why, because I won
Midnight Madness?

36:24.684 --> 36:26.718
Rachel, it doesn't mean anything...
it just means that we're even.

36:26.752 --> 36:29.521
You won with an Elphaba song,
I won with a Jean Valjean song.

36:29.555 --> 36:30.872
None of which changes the fact
that <i>Funny Girl</i>

36:30.906 --> 36:32.390
is your favorite musical,

36:32.424 --> 36:34.693
and that you were born
to play Fanny Brice.

36:34.727 --> 36:36.861
This is a once-in-a lifetime
opportunity.

36:36.896 --> 36:38.647
Let's say by some crazy
extraordinary chance I get it.

36:38.698 --> 36:40.264
Then what?

36:40.283 --> 36:43.267
I become even more of a diva
nightmare than I already am now?

36:43.286 --> 36:45.654
I can't handle the
pressures of stardom,

36:45.705 --> 36:46.988
not without losing my
best friend and making

36:47.039 --> 36:48.439
every single person hate me.

36:48.457 --> 36:50.909
So I'm not going to try out.

36:50.943 --> 36:54.162
You are a diva,

36:54.213 --> 36:56.114
and you have been a nightmare,

36:56.132 --> 36:57.749
but you're not a diva
because you've been a nightmare.

36:57.783 --> 37:01.252
You're a diva because
you're talented and ambitious

37:01.286 --> 37:02.587
and because no one else
in the world

37:02.621 --> 37:04.923
can do what you, Rachel Berry,
can do.

37:04.957 --> 37:06.341
That's what being
a diva's all about.

37:06.392 --> 37:08.043
Being an original,
one-of-a-kind.

37:08.077 --> 37:10.679
So hold the nightmare,
but bring the diva.

37:10.730 --> 37:12.564
You don't need any of that.

37:12.598 --> 37:15.266
Your work speaks for itself.

37:15.301 --> 37:17.268
I love you.

37:17.302 --> 37:18.770
I'm sorry.

37:18.804 --> 37:21.639
I hate fighting with you.

37:21.657 --> 37:23.641
Eh, a little catfight
is good for friends.

37:23.659 --> 37:26.277
You know,
keeps the relationship fresh.

37:26.311 --> 37:27.812
(bell ringing)

37:29.281 --> 37:32.033
I thought we already
checked this box.

37:32.084 --> 37:34.786
Will said the white centerpiece
arrangements we picked were fine.

37:34.820 --> 37:36.454
Which means
he doesn't like them.

37:36.488 --> 37:39.824
And he'd like to veto them,
but he's just being polite.

37:39.842 --> 37:41.426
Um, "fine" doesn't mean

37:41.460 --> 37:43.712
that he didn't like
the centerpieces.

37:43.763 --> 37:46.097
I need things to be more
than fine.

37:46.132 --> 37:47.716
Okay, I-I need them
to be perfect.

37:47.767 --> 37:49.934
They have to be perfect
and I need them to be perfect.

37:49.969 --> 37:51.720
Look, I think you're just
putting too much into this.

37:51.771 --> 37:53.972
No, I'm not, because the last
time, with Carl, I let go.

37:54.006 --> 37:55.223
I did that already, you know,

37:55.274 --> 37:56.975
I said that details
wouldn't matter,

37:57.009 --> 37:58.610
that my-my OCD
wouldn't get in the way,

37:58.644 --> 38:00.445
that whatever would happen
would happen,

38:00.479 --> 38:03.815
and that marriage was completely
ruined before it even began.

38:03.849 --> 38:06.484
Maybe Carl just wasn't the right guy.
This isn't right.

38:06.518 --> 38:08.153
I can't do this.

38:08.187 --> 38:10.572
I can't do this.
I can't get married again.

38:10.623 --> 38:12.323
I can't do it again
if it's not right.

38:12.357 --> 38:13.625
Miss Pillsbury, please.

38:13.659 --> 38:15.577
What about the color white? What
if Will hates the color white?

38:15.628 --> 38:16.961
Then he's going
to hate my dress.

38:16.996 --> 38:19.831
Of course he's not going
to hate your dress, okay?

38:19.865 --> 38:22.533
What about the cake? Not
even tried the cake yet.

38:22.551 --> 38:23.585
Okay, we make a great team.

38:23.636 --> 38:25.086
We can figure
this out together.

38:25.137 --> 38:27.371
Emma, stop. Stop. Stop.

38:36.315 --> 38:38.049
(shuttered gasps)

38:38.067 --> 38:39.567
(bell ringing)

38:44.251 --> 38:46.602
I knew you'd come
around eventually.

38:46.637 --> 38:49.421
I mean, Sam's most
redeeming quality

38:49.439 --> 38:51.390
is that he can
bore you to sleep

38:51.424 --> 38:53.759
and then you can use his lips
as ginormous pillows.

38:53.777 --> 38:55.528
I'm not breaking up with Sam.

38:55.562 --> 38:56.863
I really like him.

38:56.897 --> 38:58.564
And he makes me feel
really smart

38:58.598 --> 39:00.449
and think about things,
like where air comes from,

39:00.484 --> 39:03.619
and how come in every movie
about Jesus he dies at the end.

39:03.654 --> 39:05.538
Well, look, I'm not expecting
you to start dating me again.

39:05.572 --> 39:07.974
I'm... I'm taken.

39:10.077 --> 39:11.410
I just want you to aim higher.

39:14.248 --> 39:16.883
I know that
you're not dating Elaine.

39:16.917 --> 39:18.885
She told me that you paid
her with scratcher tickets

39:18.919 --> 39:21.137
and an Ani DiFranco T-shirt to
pretend to be your girlfriend.

39:21.171 --> 39:23.389
And I also know that you
dropped out of school.

39:23.423 --> 39:26.058
Well, I'm moving on up.

39:26.093 --> 39:28.060
Sue offered me a job to train
to take over the Cheerios

39:28.095 --> 39:29.312
after she dies.

39:29.346 --> 39:30.496
You can't do that.

39:30.531 --> 39:31.764
Why? I mean, it's not like

39:31.798 --> 39:33.049
I'd have to wait that long.

39:33.083 --> 39:34.166
I'm totally going to ricin her
protein shakes

39:34.201 --> 39:35.301
in a couple years.

39:35.319 --> 39:36.602
I think you need to be somewhere

39:36.636 --> 39:38.137
that's as big
and as hot as you are.

39:38.155 --> 39:40.106
It's okay to follow
your dreams.

39:40.140 --> 39:42.474
No, Brittany, you...
you have no idea

39:42.492 --> 39:44.476
what it's like out there
in the real world.

39:44.494 --> 39:46.412
No one gives a damn about you.

39:46.446 --> 39:47.663
Rachel found a new guy.

39:47.698 --> 39:49.949
And I hear Kurt did, too.

39:49.983 --> 39:52.285
Why shouldn't you get the
chance to be around people

39:52.319 --> 39:54.453
who are like you,
who appreciate you?

39:54.487 --> 39:56.839
Be a part of a community?

39:56.874 --> 39:58.841
Why can't you have
a real girlfriend?

39:58.876 --> 40:00.960
But not a best friend 'cause
that part's already taken.

40:07.667 --> 40:10.636
You really are genius,
Brittany.

40:10.670 --> 40:12.805
(chuckles) Duh.

40:12.839 --> 40:15.074
And you're my best friend.

40:20.013 --> 40:22.281
Sam and I are going
to Breadstix tonight

40:22.316 --> 40:24.317
to pretend to be British.
Do you want to come?

40:24.351 --> 40:26.819
No, thanks.

40:26.853 --> 40:29.155
I think I'm going to hang around
here a minute more.
