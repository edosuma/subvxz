01:14.909 --> 01:17.651
in our politically calcified and corrupt state.

01:17.995 --> 01:20.657
And remember,
if you want your vote to matter,

01:20.748 --> 01:24.366
the question is, what are you doing here?

01:25.836 --> 01:28.122
To paraphrase the great Lafcadio Hearn,

01:28.339 --> 01:32.002
better to vote once in Ohio
in sackcloth and ashes

01:32.218 --> 01:35.506
than to vote 10 times
in every parish in Louisiana.

17:12.282 --> 17:14.193
But the Daughters of Charity will take him
over at Ochsner.

17:14.326 --> 17:15.691
Is it gonna hurt?

17:15.785 --> 17:17.867
They're gonna give you some pills
or something, boy. Calm down.

17:19.039 --> 17:20.620
Fourteen and already burnt, huh?

17:20.874 --> 17:23.456
Mmm-hmm. Kid's a prodigy
in more ways than one.

17:24.711 --> 17:26.872
You know the hardest thing
about being a New Orleans musician?

17:27.547 --> 17:28.923
Explaining to your girlfriend

17:29.257 --> 17:31.839
why she got
to take penicillin for your kidney infection.

17:32.010 --> 17:33.090
(BOTH LAUGHING)

17:33.720 --> 17:34.800
Right?

17:35.889 --> 17:36.878
What you laughing at, boy?

17:38.725 --> 17:41.387
(SINGING) And trying to be my friend,
is that a fact?

17:41.478 --> 17:43.560
If you really was my friend
Then you would have my back

17:43.647 --> 17:46.389
You can drop a few beats
from time to time

17:46.483 --> 17:48.690
You can mess with the faders
But you sure can't rhyme

17:49.319 --> 17:51.731
Thought you were straight up
But it turns out you're shady

17:51.821 --> 17:53.903
You should take my side
Not stand by the uptown lady

17:53.990 --> 17:56.481
Y'all are out of the business
Y'all can have your fun

17:56.826 --> 17:59.488
Find another whipping boy
'Cause DJ Davis

17:59.663 --> 18:04.032
He ain't the one

18:04.876 --> 18:08.960
BOTH: Fuck all of you bitches

18:09.673 --> 18:12.836
I'm so sick of your shit

18:13.593 --> 18:14.582
You tell 'em

18:14.678 --> 18:19.672
-And y'all can't fire me
-Why?

18:20.100 --> 18:21.556
Don't expect me on my hands and knees

18:21.643 --> 18:25.261
Asking y'all to rehire me, no

18:25.355 --> 18:29.018
-Y'all can't fire me
-Why, why?

18:29.109 --> 18:30.565
BOTH: 'Cause I quit

18:30.694 --> 18:32.184
And that's a wrap, bitch.

18:32.696 --> 18:34.152
MAN: Oh, yeah!

18:34.406 --> 18:35.987
Thank you.

18:36.074 --> 18:39.532
We are DJ "I Quit" Davis
and the Educated Fools.

18:39.703 --> 18:42.661
That was indeed our theme song
featuring the legendary Cheeky Blakk.

18:42.747 --> 18:43.782
Yeah.

18:45.959 --> 18:47.915
Thank you, thank you.
We're gonna be right back

18:48.003 --> 18:50.039
after a short break and a safety meeting.

18:50.588 --> 18:53.170
And then be back for our third and final set.
So don't go anywhere.

18:53.466 --> 18:54.967
And if you do go anywhere,

18:55.051 --> 18:57.383
leave $10 in the tip jar

18:57.762 --> 19:00.139
and a personal handwritten letter of apology.

19:02.684 --> 19:03.844
All right.

19:07.439 --> 19:09.976
Jesus Christ. Oh, fuck.

19:10.567 --> 19:13.274
Hey, man, this is lighter than last week.

19:13.361 --> 19:15.101
Which was lighter than the week before.

19:15.363 --> 19:16.352
I'll take one.

19:16.448 --> 19:19.611
We got to write something fresh,
something new.

19:20.076 --> 19:22.408
Gentlemen and lady,

19:23.413 --> 19:28.032
I think we've taken the pieces
of my stillborn opera as far as we can.

19:30.086 --> 19:31.075
(SIGHS)

19:31.171 --> 19:33.162
What is my next move?

19:33.340 --> 19:35.251
You could actually fucking quit, Davis.

19:56.613 --> 19:58.569
(PLAYING ZYDECO MUSIC)

21:04.848 --> 21:06.713
Thank you so much, you guys.

21:07.016 --> 21:09.632
We are Annie T. and Her Bayou Cadillac.

21:10.019 --> 21:14.228
And don't step away.
Michael Doucet and BeauSoleil are up next.

21:14.524 --> 21:16.560
Thank you so much.

Hey, Annie.

21:22.157 --> 21:23.567
(COMPLIMENTING IN FRENCH)

21:25.702 --> 21:27.317
And love the name of the band, by the way.

21:27.412 --> 21:28.447
-You do?
-Yeah.

21:28.538 --> 21:30.824
-You don't mind?
-No, we take it as a compliment.

21:30.915 --> 21:32.951
-We meant it as one.
-Thank you. Good luck.

21:33.042 --> 21:35.533
Thank you so much. Have a great set.

21:35.712 --> 21:37.122
-Hey!
-Hey.

21:37.213 --> 21:39.795
Oh, my God. I think best show yet.

21:39.883 --> 21:41.714
I mean, this one or the one in Mobile.

21:42.177 --> 21:45.715
I mean, don't you wish we had these on tape?
We could throw together a live album.

21:46.473 --> 21:48.759
Hey, sell a few copies in Mobile.

21:49.434 --> 21:51.550
Or Lafayette. Or even New Orleans.

22:30.600 --> 22:33.091
It's okay if I just get a bite at the bar? Thanks.

(PLAYING ZYDECO MUSIC)

22:53.790 --> 22:54.950
Dude.

22:55.875 --> 22:57.035
Oh, my God.

22:57.877 --> 22:59.583
They're amazing.

22:59.671 --> 23:01.081
I mean, listen to them.

23:01.464 --> 23:03.750
That's what I want us
to be doing in a few years.

23:28.491 --> 23:31.278
Hey, why do I get
the feeling you're trying to tell me something?

23:32.287 --> 23:34.323
A few more years
you want to be big-time in Lafayette?

23:34.414 --> 23:36.154
BeauSoleil is big-time everywhere.

23:36.249 --> 23:38.114
To you. But in case you haven't noticed,

23:38.209 --> 23:41.622
it is getting harder and harder to survive
on the margins in this industry.

23:41.713 --> 23:42.748
What does that mean?

23:42.839 --> 23:45.376
Look, the album did what it did.

23:45.466 --> 23:46.797
This touring's doing what it can.

23:46.884 --> 23:49.500
But you'll notice that once
we get north of anywhere,

23:49.596 --> 23:52.053
y'all don't draw and you do not sell.

23:52.265 --> 23:55.257
Why? Because in the great
big world outside Louisiana,

23:55.351 --> 23:56.682
y'all are a niche act.

Marvin, what the fuck?
We're in Lafayette. They loved it.

24:06.446 --> 24:08.903
That's right. You're in Lafayette.

24:09.824 --> 24:10.813
So what are you saying?

24:11.284 --> 24:12.865
I thought you were hungrier.

24:13.536 --> 24:14.571
That's what I'm saying.

-Can you sit for a second?

24:39.187 --> 24:40.723
Yeah, I can sit for a second.

24:40.855 --> 24:44.188
I'm glad you've done so well with this place.
I would have hated for it to sit empty.

24:44.275 --> 24:45.390
You left a lot of goodwill.

24:46.819 --> 24:48.980
I heard it didn't work out
with that big fine place on the Avenue.

-Yeah, I'm opening a newjoint.
-Good for you. Where at?

Whoa, that's way down in the Bywater.

25:09.550 --> 25:11.927
Yeah. We got the Falcons
this Sunday in Georgia.

25:12.220 --> 25:13.209
Uh-huh.

25:13.346 --> 25:14.631
I hate the fucking Falcons.

25:15.098 --> 25:16.133
Mmm.

25:17.058 --> 25:18.173
I know, it's just football.

25:19.769 --> 25:22.181
Matt Ryan's favorite target, Roddy White.

25:22.271 --> 25:25.104
Jason Elam, he is money inside the 50.

That is very impressive.

It's in the fridge.

I need coffee. Got to pack and get going.

drank beer in the morning.

Mold and rot had its way
with just about everything.

26:02.353 --> 26:03.593
You gonna rebuild?

26:04.355 --> 26:05.390
We'll see.

26:05.481 --> 26:08.268
So what should I call you now?

26:08.359 --> 26:11.601
Terry? Detective Colson?

26:11.696 --> 26:13.106
The Tall Guy should do it.

You did just fine.

-She's coming home for Thanksgiving, right?
-Yeah.

I already talked to them.

27:05.458 --> 27:07.824
and a handpicked band for the next tour.

27:07.919 --> 27:09.455
What the hell's wrong with your band?

27:09.545 --> 27:11.081
Nothing that I can tell,

27:11.214 --> 27:13.455
but he says he's done
all he can with us the way we are.

27:13.800 --> 27:14.960
But I like the way y'all are.

27:15.051 --> 27:17.758
Me, too. I mean, Ithought I did.

27:18.638 --> 27:20.424
But what do I know?

27:22.475 --> 27:24.386
I should tell him to go fuck himself, right?

27:25.394 --> 27:28.227
I mean, isn't that what I'm supposed to say?

27:28.523 --> 27:30.309
I don't know.

27:30.441 --> 27:32.147
Lost Highway Records?

27:32.235 --> 27:33.941
That's a step above any of the local labels.

I told you he was oozy.

27:41.077 --> 27:42.408
No, I told you.

27:43.371 --> 27:45.862
Yeah. Yeah, you did.

27:45.957 --> 27:47.072
So what are you gonna do?

27:47.750 --> 27:48.990
I don't know.

27:49.460 --> 27:51.667
I can't fire the band.

28:08.271 --> 28:12.014
Hey, thanks for letting me
talk this through with you.

28:12.483 --> 28:14.314
I don't know who else to go to with it.

28:26.706 --> 28:27.912
Good to see you, Annie.

28:44.515 --> 28:47.302
It's a light-up, three-tier merchandise display.

28:47.393 --> 28:48.929
Did I ask for any of this?

28:49.145 --> 28:50.260
But look.

28:55.526 --> 28:56.561
Ain't that sharp?

Okay, get it out.

-Miss LaDonna...
-All I wanted was a shelf.

29:00.239 --> 29:02.651
I'm not paying for any of this. Take it out.

All right.

-She around?
-Your aunt?

29:19.842 --> 29:23.710
No, Marie Laveau.
Yes, my aunt. Did she come in today?

29:23.804 --> 29:25.180
I can hit her on her cell.

29:25.264 --> 29:27.220
No, don't bother. I'm out.

29:27.350 --> 29:28.840
Here's your paycheck.

29:28.935 --> 29:32.302
I got to go pick up my car from the garage.

29:32.730 --> 29:37.315
$800 and change for making the acquaintance
of another Crescent City sinkhole.

are keeping honest hours around here.

you guys pay me not to come to work.

-You can admit it.
-Hold on a sec.

29:47.787 --> 29:49.618
I want you to hear something.

-Just play it.

When that's done,
then we'll tackle the carport.

We close in here.

and paint, pretty much.

A little, but I tend
to be more conservative in my approach.

Down here in New Orleans,
we've lost our naivete.

years past believing that anything but spit,

keeps anyone high and dry.

you're gonna be making

and then close down the clubs.
