Oh... that meeting.

00:06.750 --> 00:08.544
I'm a head of accounts, damn it!

00:08.890 --> 00:10.135
What's gotten into you?

00:10.320 --> 00:11.896
You're supposed to be
calming me down.

00:12.041 --> 00:14.321
- Ted, I've got cancer.
- What?

00:14.436 --> 00:15.592
You gotta call Ted.

00:17.407 --> 00:19.336
<i>They wanted our ideas
and a big agency,</i>

00:19.465 --> 00:20.827
so we gave them both.

00:20.951 --> 00:22.328
We merged.

00:24.168 --> 00:25.772
We have to be careful.

00:25.906 --> 00:27.640
We can't fall in love.

First day of school.
You nervous?

02:10.426 --> 02:12.428
What do you think?

02:12.462 --> 02:14.796
It seems silly to ask, but do
you know where you're going?

02:14.831 --> 02:17.099
I'll just follow you.

02:17.134 --> 02:20.435
- Hello, everyone.
- Hey!

02:20.469 --> 02:23.004
Stan, Ginsberg, Ted Chaough.

02:24.606 --> 02:27.042
This is Margie. Margie, Peggy.
Margie, Ted.

02:27.076 --> 02:28.809
It's nice to put
faces with names.

02:28.844 --> 02:30.578
I saw you taking your
little tour the other week

02:30.612 --> 02:31.913
and you looked pretty tall.

02:31.947 --> 02:33.614
But now I see
you're about my height.

02:33.649 --> 02:36.150
I hope you can still
look up to me.

02:36.184 --> 02:39.219
- That was quick.
- Pleasure, Margie.

02:39.254 --> 02:41.621
I've heard a lot about you.
We're all very excited.

02:44.859 --> 02:46.527
Nice knowing you.

02:52.066 --> 02:54.700
John Mathis.

02:54.734 --> 02:56.902
You're in the second office
from reception.

02:56.937 --> 02:59.738
Your secretary will be Connie.

02:59.773 --> 03:03.809
You know my name,
but I don't know yours.

03:03.843 --> 03:05.545
Excuse me, Joan.

03:05.579 --> 03:07.679
Are all the creatives
in one office?

03:07.713 --> 03:11.483
- It's temporary.
- Well, it's going to be very crowded.

03:11.517 --> 03:14.252
But that may change soon.

03:14.287 --> 03:17.689
I know where all
the bodies are buried.

03:17.723 --> 03:20.559
- I need a copy of that.
- They're just notes.

03:20.593 --> 03:22.259
I need a copy
for Mr. Chaough.

03:22.294 --> 03:23.994
He's not going
to change anything,

03:24.028 --> 03:25.596
but he's going to be angry
if I don't know what it is.

03:25.630 --> 03:27.231
Good morning, Moira.

03:27.265 --> 03:30.033
- Joan.
- Good morning.

03:30.068 --> 03:32.936
- Well, hello there.
- Hello.

03:32.971 --> 03:34.805
I'm sorry they didn't
have your office ready yet.

03:34.839 --> 03:36.207
I'll make do.

03:36.241 --> 03:37.708
You know what, Moira?

03:37.742 --> 03:39.509
I'll take care of Miss Olson.

03:39.543 --> 03:41.578
Hopefully you can read
my handwriting.

03:41.612 --> 03:45.381
We're putting you
in Harry's old office.

03:45.416 --> 03:47.917
- Oh.
- But you don't have to share it.

03:47.951 --> 03:49.685
As long as I don't
have to share Phyllis.

03:49.720 --> 03:51.721
- ( gasps )
- Are you okay?

03:51.755 --> 03:53.889
I don't know.

03:53.924 --> 03:56.925
It could be moving boxes
or it could be I slept funny.

03:58.361 --> 04:00.028
Are you still in there?

04:00.062 --> 04:02.464
Yes, everything keeps
changing out here,

04:02.499 --> 04:04.666
but everything's
the same in there.

04:04.700 --> 04:06.101
Except you're a partner.

04:06.136 --> 04:08.403
And you're the copy chief. _

04:13.108 --> 04:14.509
How's your little boy?

04:14.543 --> 04:16.444
He's the man in my life.

04:16.478 --> 04:18.579
- How's yours?
- Oh, he's good.

04:18.613 --> 04:20.414
We bought a building
together to live in.

04:20.449 --> 04:22.983
We bought a building
to live in together.

04:23.018 --> 04:25.419
I'm glad you're here.

04:25.454 --> 04:27.754
Well, I'm glad you're here.

"In addition to the dynamic

a beautiful message

05:24.642 --> 05:26.410
to read to our employees,

05:26.444 --> 05:28.111
but perhaps it's best to wait

05:28.145 --> 05:29.813
until we've made all
of the personnel changes.

05:29.847 --> 05:31.380
And you need an ending.

05:31.415 --> 05:34.016
We have a lot
of writers out there.

05:34.050 --> 05:36.619
I'm sorry.
Someone commandeered Clara.

05:39.623 --> 05:41.056
I need a seat.

05:43.260 --> 05:44.827
Don took the last one.

05:44.861 --> 05:47.696
That means you were
here after Don.

05:47.730 --> 05:49.397
Can you see if there's
another chair?

05:49.432 --> 05:51.099
Or you could have my seat.

05:51.133 --> 05:54.068
Yes, thank you.

05:55.070 --> 05:56.504
Moira, take my chair.

06:08.082 --> 06:10.484
Now that we've dispensed
with the gallantry,

06:10.518 --> 06:12.753
Jim Cutler and I have,
we believe, harvested

06:12.787 --> 06:14.388
the gold dusting of the Clios

06:14.422 --> 06:16.323
by arranging for
an advanced introduction

06:16.358 --> 06:17.958
to Fleischmann's Margarine.

06:17.992 --> 06:20.926
They want to be Ted
and Don's first love child.

06:20.961 --> 06:22.729
That's new business.

06:22.763 --> 06:24.930
Isn't there a section of this
meeting called good news?

06:24.965 --> 06:27.767
I never would have taken you
for such a stickler.

06:27.801 --> 06:30.603
Fleischmann's? Groovy.
We'll get right on it.

06:30.638 --> 06:32.805
Regarding ongoing business,

06:32.839 --> 06:35.974
the following is a list of current
accounts in ascending order.

06:36.008 --> 06:37.976
That means smallest to largest,

06:38.010 --> 06:40.712
<i>Chevrolet being excluded</i>
<i>for a separate meeting.</i>

06:40.747 --> 06:42.881
Topaz Pantyhose.

06:42.915 --> 06:44.949
Ken Cosgrove and Burt Peterson.

06:44.984 --> 06:47.452
- And they're thrilled.
- Leica Camera.

06:47.487 --> 06:49.788
Roger and I might
have to go to Germany.

06:49.822 --> 06:52.657
But that's only because
we invited ourselves.

06:52.691 --> 06:54.224
The New York State Thruway.

06:54.259 --> 06:55.493
I just got off the phone

06:55.527 --> 06:56.860
with Henry Lammott
at Mohawk Airlines--

06:56.895 --> 06:58.262
Mohawk's on the next page.

06:58.297 --> 07:00.230
This is related to the Thruway.

07:00.265 --> 07:02.266
Henry Lammott
considers it a conflict,

07:02.301 --> 07:04.635
<i>car travel and air travel</i>
<i>being mortal enemies.</i>

07:04.670 --> 07:07.003
So when Burt Peterson gets ahold
of them, we should resign.

07:07.037 --> 07:09.105
Did you tell Lammott
that was a stretch?

07:09.139 --> 07:11.808
It's a $250,000 media budget.

07:11.842 --> 07:13.343
Mohawk is an airline.

07:13.377 --> 07:16.279
Except, Ted, the client
is New York State

07:16.314 --> 07:18.214
and they gave us
their media buy up front.

07:18.248 --> 07:20.650
- And you already spent it.
- Why didn't you tell us that?

07:20.685 --> 07:24.486
Why didn't you tell us you lost Vicks
for yourself and Clearasil for us?

07:24.521 --> 07:26.622
Why didn't you tell us
Frank Gleason was dying?

07:26.656 --> 07:28.390
Frank's going to be fine.

07:28.425 --> 07:30.659
I know Henry Lammott.

07:30.694 --> 07:32.761
Pete and I will fly up there.

07:32.796 --> 07:34.095
And Ted.

07:34.130 --> 07:35.597
Of course.

07:35.632 --> 07:37.065
What kind of plane do you have?

07:37.099 --> 07:39.200
A Mohawk plane.

07:39.234 --> 07:40.802
Ted's a pilot.

07:44.272 --> 07:45.740
I'll take us up there.

07:45.774 --> 07:47.742
We can land
right outside his office.

07:50.979 --> 07:53.614
- Even better.
- I'm sorry to interrupt.

07:53.649 --> 07:55.449
Mr. Campbell, there's an
urgent phone call for you.

07:57.084 --> 07:58.952
However we're going,

07:58.986 --> 08:01.521
I recommend we go up tomorrow.

08:06.627 --> 08:08.428
What's the next client?

08:08.463 --> 08:11.263
Um, Koss Headphones.

08:11.297 --> 08:13.733
Jim: <i>Burt Peterson
and Ken Cosgrove.</i>

08:13.767 --> 08:17.035
<i>They sent Burt Peterson</i>
<i>a case of champagne.</i>

08:18.271 --> 08:19.805
Billy?

08:19.840 --> 08:22.274
Mr. Campbell,
I didn't want to trouble you,

08:22.308 --> 08:24.309
but she was--

08:24.344 --> 08:26.845
she's right here.
You want to talk to her?

08:26.879 --> 08:28.346
What happened exactly?

08:28.381 --> 08:30.648
Well, she was banging
on the door pretty hard,

08:30.683 --> 08:32.283
saying she needed
to see your father.

08:32.317 --> 08:34.352
<i>I thought somebody</i>
<i>was gonna call a cop.</i>

08:34.386 --> 08:35.787
May I speak with her?

08:37.623 --> 08:40.258
Bill, you've been so decent,
I hate to ask you another favor,

08:40.292 --> 08:42.592
but could you get her
a G and T with two ice cubes?

08:42.626 --> 08:45.195
- Gin and tonic?
- Yes, if you don't mind.

08:47.499 --> 08:49.266
I don't know what's going on,

08:49.300 --> 08:52.369
but I found this address
on my nightstand

08:52.404 --> 08:54.438
in some woman's handwriting

08:54.472 --> 08:57.073
and I assumed your father
was up to his old tricks.

08:57.108 --> 08:59.275
Mother, he passed away.

08:59.309 --> 09:01.411
You'd like that.
No.

09:01.445 --> 09:03.513
He hasn't been home
for over a week

09:03.547 --> 09:06.048
and his golf clubs
are still at the house.

09:06.082 --> 09:07.550
( ice cracks )

09:07.584 --> 09:09.118
Mother, you sound confused.

09:09.152 --> 09:10.653
What are you implying?

09:10.687 --> 09:12.655
I want you to relax,
watch the television,

09:12.689 --> 09:14.356
and I will call Bud
to come and get you.

09:14.391 --> 09:16.825
He's going to send
that girl Trudy.

09:16.859 --> 09:19.027
Bud's wife is Judy, not Trudy.

09:19.061 --> 09:22.196
Now I suppose I'm crazy
for mixing those up.

09:22.231 --> 09:23.899
Tell Billy you're fine
on your own.

09:23.933 --> 09:25.467
I am.

09:28.304 --> 09:29.771
( sighs )

09:38.680 --> 09:40.581
Hello there.

09:40.615 --> 09:42.983
Nice to see you, Peggy.

09:43.017 --> 09:44.485
Burt.

09:44.519 --> 09:46.820
We're a long way
from Sterling Cooper.

09:46.854 --> 09:49.288
Looks like the worm has turned.

09:49.323 --> 09:52.625
Well, it's nice to have
the old team back together.

09:52.660 --> 09:55.361
- <i>( phone ringing )</i>
- Do you want me to get that?

09:59.032 --> 10:00.232
Hello.

10:00.267 --> 10:03.302
Oh, I was expecting
a secretary.

10:03.337 --> 10:05.104
There isn't one
on the line, is there?

10:05.138 --> 10:07.306
Hold on.

10:08.976 --> 10:10.542
I've got to take this.

10:10.577 --> 10:12.310
Well, we'll have plenty
of time to catch up

10:12.345 --> 10:13.878
on those flights to Detroit.

10:18.917 --> 10:21.586
He's still a cold fish.

10:24.123 --> 10:25.690
Hello.

10:25.724 --> 10:28.193
Come over here now.

10:28.227 --> 10:30.094
I can't.

10:30.128 --> 10:32.463
I have too much
going on in the office.

10:32.498 --> 10:34.231
I need you

10:34.265 --> 10:36.534
and nothing else will do.

10:40.405 --> 10:42.006
Oh.

10:44.675 --> 10:46.142
So?

10:48.345 --> 10:51.114
12:30 at
the Sherry-Netherland.

10:51.148 --> 10:53.483
Call me with a room number.

10:58.823 --> 11:01.056
Come on in, Burt.

11:02.358 --> 11:04.192
Have a seat.

11:05.194 --> 11:07.062
What is this, a bed?

11:07.096 --> 11:08.964
Yeah, you might want
to lie down

11:08.999 --> 11:11.099
because here we are again.

11:11.134 --> 11:14.570
Well, I haven't
forgotten anything.

11:14.604 --> 11:16.572
Not a damn thing.

11:16.606 --> 11:18.840
A lot of times in life
you get to do something

11:18.874 --> 11:20.509
and you don't realize
until it's over

11:20.543 --> 11:22.244
how much you enjoyed it.

11:22.278 --> 11:24.212
And you swear that the
next time it comes around,

11:24.247 --> 11:26.081
you're gonna remember that.

11:26.115 --> 11:27.549
You're right.

11:27.583 --> 11:29.217
And I think I can
work with you, too.

11:29.252 --> 11:31.153
Work?

11:31.187 --> 11:33.754
No, Burt, I'm letting
you go again.

11:33.788 --> 11:36.823
What the hell?
You-- you can't do that.

11:36.858 --> 11:40.694
Probably doesn't make a difference at
this point, but no one fought for you.

11:40.728 --> 11:44.265
Well, we'll see what the folks
at Chevy have to say about this.

11:44.299 --> 11:46.100
Remember Ken Cosgrove?

11:46.134 --> 11:48.969
Like a six-foot version
of Alan Ladd?

11:49.003 --> 11:50.970
He's touring
the plant right now.

11:51.004 --> 11:53.373
You bastard.

11:53.407 --> 11:55.442
I've got four million
in billings.

11:55.476 --> 11:57.877
- What have you got?
- I was thinking you would feel that way.

11:57.911 --> 12:00.813
That you had more clients
and that gives you a voice.

12:00.847 --> 12:04.250
I was imagining you talking
over me in meetings.

12:04.285 --> 12:06.351
Now I don't have that problem.

12:06.386 --> 12:08.387
My clients will leave with me.

12:08.421 --> 12:11.290
( chuckles ) No one will ever
say you weren't funny, Burt.

12:11.324 --> 12:13.058
Well, I'll tell you one thing,

12:13.093 --> 12:14.859
I'm expecting some kind
of severance.

12:14.894 --> 12:16.828
Who knows?
We're really hurting.

12:16.862 --> 12:18.997
We're having to cut back.
Well, obviously.

12:19.031 --> 12:20.799
God, you're a real prick,
you know that?

12:20.833 --> 12:23.167
Damn it, Burt,
you stole my good-bye.

12:32.411 --> 12:34.645
Oh, hello.
You must be Burt Peterson.

12:34.679 --> 12:37.414
I'm Bob Benson.
I'm supposed to report to you.

12:37.448 --> 12:39.316
Well, as a first order
of business,

12:39.350 --> 12:41.451
I recommend that you stick
your head between your legs

12:41.486 --> 12:43.086
and kiss your ass good-bye.

13:22.258 --> 13:23.891
What did you say to me?

13:25.127 --> 13:27.227
Come see me.

13:27.262 --> 13:28.862
No.

13:30.064 --> 13:32.666
I need you

13:32.700 --> 13:34.834
and nothing else will do.

13:48.315 --> 13:49.882
You worked on the Daisy?

13:50.917 --> 13:53.252
No, I worked on the KKK spot.

13:53.287 --> 13:55.120
You probably heard about it.
It was too hot to run.

13:55.155 --> 13:57.056
- That's very impressive.
- Thank you.

13:57.090 --> 13:59.257
I mean, you made it 15 minutes
before you brought it up.

13:59.292 --> 14:00.559
( chuckles )

14:00.593 --> 14:02.427
I just spoke with Dawn.

14:02.461 --> 14:04.196
Black or white?

14:04.230 --> 14:06.030
She wouldn't tell me anything.

14:06.065 --> 14:07.832
She's an excellent secretary.

14:07.866 --> 14:10.134
I'm sure he can catch up.

14:10.169 --> 14:14.004
So, before we inundate ourselves
with Fleischmann's unique benefits

14:14.038 --> 14:16.973
and previous work,
I want to, I don't know,

14:17.008 --> 14:19.443
have a little rap session
about margarine in general.

14:21.513 --> 14:23.347
You mean like in terms
of the prospect?

14:23.381 --> 14:25.416
Just whatever's on your mind.
Free-associate.

14:27.819 --> 14:29.919
- ( whispers )
- My grandmother.

14:29.953 --> 14:31.554
Yeah.

14:31.589 --> 14:33.155
Yellow.

14:33.190 --> 14:34.591
Yes.

14:34.625 --> 14:35.991
Greasy.

14:36.026 --> 14:37.427
It's not butter.
It's cheap.

14:37.461 --> 14:38.794
It has no smell.

14:38.829 --> 14:40.463
Yeah, man.
Keep going.

14:40.497 --> 14:41.864
People hate it.

14:41.898 --> 14:43.399
Hold on a second.
Who hates margarine?

14:43.434 --> 14:44.967
You said there were
no wrong answers.

14:45.001 --> 14:47.469
- I didn't say that.
- I don't hate it.

14:48.804 --> 14:51.707
It was invented
for Napoleon III

14:51.741 --> 14:54.909
because armies need to move
and it never spoiled.

14:54.944 --> 14:56.645
That's fantastic.

14:56.679 --> 14:57.979
How did you know that?

14:59.014 --> 15:00.482
I don't know, I just did.

15:00.516 --> 15:02.250
Let's get down
10 uses for margarine.

15:02.251 --> 15:04.093
French army is number one.

15:05.354 --> 15:07.221
And of course I was upset

15:07.256 --> 15:09.390
because I was waiting
for Mitchell to call.

15:09.424 --> 15:11.759
Then Arnie tells me
to cut the apron strings.

15:11.793 --> 15:13.327
All of France is on fire.

15:13.362 --> 15:15.296
I don't even know
if the phones are working.

15:15.330 --> 15:17.597
There's no room for me to worry
about anyone but Arnold,

15:17.632 --> 15:19.098
not even our son.

15:20.301 --> 15:22.469
You can talk about your kid,

15:22.503 --> 15:24.337
but I don't want to hear
about your husband.

15:24.372 --> 15:26.072
I can talk about
whatever I want.

15:26.106 --> 15:28.508
Can you help me look
for my shoes while you do it?

15:28.542 --> 15:30.677
You want me to look
for your shoes?

15:34.581 --> 15:37.316
I want you to crawl on your hands
and knees until you find them.

15:37.350 --> 15:39.184
( scoffs )

15:39.218 --> 15:41.520
They're right over there.

15:42.789 --> 15:44.456
Do it.

16:15.853 --> 16:18.021
I want you to get undressed,

16:18.055 --> 16:19.956
then get back into bed.

16:49.352 --> 16:50.852
Come over here.

16:59.494 --> 17:01.027
( key jangles )

17:01.062 --> 17:02.996
Don't go anywhere.

17:21.791 --> 17:24.127
I'm hearing a lot about bread.

17:25.561 --> 17:27.864
It spreads easy
because it's soft.

17:29.465 --> 17:31.600
Really melts into the--

17:32.602 --> 17:34.903
What did he just say?

17:34.938 --> 17:37.006
Don.
There you are.

17:38.407 --> 17:40.375
Sorry about that.
I got held up.

17:50.719 --> 17:53.121
Let's not push too hard today.

17:53.155 --> 17:55.489
- What'd I miss?
- We got some good ideas,

17:55.524 --> 17:57.558
and I think we're ready for
a more traditional approach--

17:57.592 --> 18:01.062
research, et cetera--
later in the week.

18:01.096 --> 18:03.797
Great.
Peggy, you set the meeting.

18:13.107 --> 18:15.108
What was that?

18:15.143 --> 18:17.010
What? You called
the meeting to a close.

18:17.045 --> 18:18.578
You also had it without me.

18:18.612 --> 18:20.680
If the meeting's at 1:00,
the meeting's at 1:00.

18:20.714 --> 18:22.682
Don, five minutes,
10 minutes--

18:22.716 --> 18:24.651
I've been working in creative
my whole life, it's fine.

18:24.685 --> 18:26.419
40 minutes?
Come on.

18:26.453 --> 18:28.020
I've got better things to do,

18:28.055 --> 18:30.423
but obviously you did, too.

18:50.041 --> 18:52.176
( ringing )

18:55.547 --> 18:56.880
Hello.

18:56.915 --> 18:58.716
Are you still in bed?

18:58.750 --> 19:00.618
Are you on your way?

19:02.688 --> 19:05.422
You're going to wait there

19:05.456 --> 19:07.857
and you're not going to know
when I'm coming back.

19:07.891 --> 19:10.827
What's gotten into you?

19:12.162 --> 19:14.063
Don't answer the phone again.

19:35.585 --> 19:38.185
( ringing )

19:59.039 --> 20:01.808
<i>( intercom buzzes )</i>

20:01.842 --> 20:04.778
- Yes?
- Moira: <i>Mr. Draper is here to see you.</i>

20:04.812 --> 20:06.747
Send him in.

20:11.752 --> 20:14.353
- Am I bothering you?
- What is that?

20:14.388 --> 20:16.689
An olive branch.

20:19.959 --> 20:21.894
I was just thinking
that it's probably best

20:21.928 --> 20:24.029
if we talk about
margarine by ourselves.

20:32.204 --> 20:34.472
Sorry, I don't know
what you drink.

20:34.507 --> 20:35.973
Whatever there is.

20:36.008 --> 20:38.310
Of course, everything
is packed away.

20:38.344 --> 20:40.412
I would have opened that first.

20:40.446 --> 20:41.945
Might have clients coming in.

20:41.979 --> 20:43.180
I have something better
for the clients.

20:43.214 --> 20:44.515
I have this bar cart
wheeled in.

20:44.549 --> 20:45.783
How is that better?

20:45.817 --> 20:47.384
You should see the girl
who wheels it in.

20:47.419 --> 20:49.019
It's quite a presentation.

20:49.053 --> 20:51.021
If you don't want to drink,
you don't have to drink.

21:00.997 --> 21:04.300
So, you want to show me
your notes from the meeting?

21:04.335 --> 21:07.704
It took 40 minutes to figure out
no one knows shit about margarine.

21:07.738 --> 21:09.772
( chuckles )

21:09.807 --> 21:11.040
May I?

21:11.074 --> 21:12.875
Is this gonna be Detroit again?

21:12.909 --> 21:14.509
You're gonna lie down
on the couch while I pace?

21:14.544 --> 21:17.045
I'll lie down after
we have our next one.

21:17.079 --> 21:19.648
Let's get something
on paper first.

21:26.789 --> 21:29.357
- Where is she?
- Well, she spent 25 minutes

21:29.391 --> 21:32.292
looking for a dish for the nuts and
then she went into the bathroom.

21:32.327 --> 21:34.462
- Good luck.
- Where are you going?

21:34.496 --> 21:36.797
She's using the ladies' room.
She's been doing it for years.

21:36.832 --> 21:39.199
- No, take her home.
- My home?

21:39.234 --> 21:41.869
- That's not an option.
- That is the only option.

21:41.903 --> 21:43.504
Do you have any idea
what's going on in my office?

21:43.538 --> 21:45.005
We're in the middle
of a merger,

21:45.039 --> 21:46.406
in case you didn't get
past the sports section.

21:46.440 --> 21:48.575
I'm supposed to suddenly
care after you went

21:48.609 --> 21:50.610
to White Weld to underwrite
your public offering?

21:50.644 --> 21:52.579
I caught a shovelful
for that, Pete.

21:52.613 --> 21:54.882
I got to pretend to my partners
that you don't believe in nepotism.

21:54.916 --> 21:57.017
I apologize that you didn't
get on that sinking ship.

21:57.051 --> 21:58.852
You just ride out this merger,

21:58.887 --> 22:01.521
and in six months
I'm your first call.

22:01.555 --> 22:04.023
You don't understand. I went
to a meeting this morning

22:04.057 --> 22:07.226
- and there was no chair for me.
- You're as high-strung as her.

22:07.261 --> 22:09.896
First you don't have a chair,
then you don't have any clients.

22:09.930 --> 22:12.598
- Mother, it's time to go.
- Don't do that yet.

22:12.632 --> 22:14.333
Just get
your thoughts together.

22:14.368 --> 22:16.635
- You have a long drive home.
- She has an apartment.

22:16.669 --> 22:18.937
Even the cleaning woman quit.

22:18.938 --> 22:22.007
Mother's cut all ties. The whole
place smells like a rabbit warren.

22:22.041 --> 22:24.309
Judy and I have taken our turn.
Now it's yours.

22:24.343 --> 22:26.511
No, that is not going to work.
<i>( toilet flushes )</i>

22:26.545 --> 22:29.447
( sighs ) Judy is
finished with her.

22:29.481 --> 22:33.418
They got in a dispute about
Earl Grey or Major Grey

22:33.452 --> 22:36.320
and Mother snapped her with a
tea towel across the face.

22:36.354 --> 22:37.789
She should be locked up.

22:37.823 --> 22:40.157
Maybe we can get
the paperwork started.

22:40.191 --> 22:43.260
In the meantime,
buy Trudy a catcher's mask

22:43.295 --> 22:45.763
and be happy that you get
to go to work every day.

22:54.371 --> 22:56.306
I know why he's late
for everything.

22:56.340 --> 22:58.408
Because we've put up with it.

22:58.443 --> 23:02.245
I mean, honestly, is Peter
any busier than you are?

23:02.279 --> 23:03.580
Mother, I'm Peter.

23:03.614 --> 23:05.549
Do you want to go
to the Colony?

23:05.583 --> 23:07.182
That's a splendid idea.

23:07.216 --> 23:09.151
No, I have some soup.

23:09.185 --> 23:11.887
Just take me home.

23:11.922 --> 23:14.222
You're spending the night here.
You can have the bed.

23:14.257 --> 23:15.991
I never sleep.

23:16.025 --> 23:18.494
And you should be well rested.

23:18.528 --> 23:20.529
Could you freshen this?

23:23.098 --> 23:25.132
So Blue Bonnet
is the girl in pigtails?

23:25.167 --> 23:27.068
Mary Ann.

23:27.102 --> 23:29.070
"Gilligan's Island"
always works.

23:29.104 --> 23:31.372
Every brand is represented.

23:31.406 --> 23:34.776
So Fleischmann's is
the Marilyn Monroe redhead?

23:34.810 --> 23:37.044
I don't know who's Ginger.

23:37.079 --> 23:38.812
Probably Parkay.

23:38.847 --> 23:40.547
Then you've got
Thurston Howell--

23:40.582 --> 23:42.382
Imperial with the crown.

23:42.416 --> 23:44.651
I think the one that's wide
open is the Professor.

23:44.686 --> 23:46.987
Facts and figures,
health benefits.

23:47.021 --> 23:48.355
Some kind of formula.

23:48.389 --> 23:49.756
They're all made differently,

23:49.791 --> 23:51.191
even if it's just location.

23:51.225 --> 23:53.026
No, I find it interesting

23:53.060 --> 23:55.495
that you've broken this down
into a formula.

23:56.913 --> 23:58.485
There's a lot of bridges
to Manhattan.

23:58.665 --> 24:01.433
You don't have any tricks for
when you're stuck other than...

24:01.468 --> 24:03.102
<i>Are we stuck already?</i>

24:03.136 --> 24:05.705
Let's take the competition
to a broader level.

24:05.739 --> 24:09.441
Let's say there are more margarines
than characters on your TV show.

24:09.476 --> 24:11.175
They all have
something in common.

24:11.210 --> 24:12.677
They all want off the island.

24:12.712 --> 24:14.913
No, they're all not butter.

24:14.947 --> 24:17.782
- No one prefers margarine.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

24:17.817 --> 24:19.584
I have to eat something.

24:19.619 --> 24:21.753
Doesn't ice count?

24:21.787 --> 24:23.922
I'd settle for some more toast.

24:23.956 --> 24:25.724
Ahem.

24:28.092 --> 24:30.628
( sighs )

24:30.662 --> 24:32.596
It's morning.

24:32.631 --> 24:36.133
We know because we see
the rooster crow.

24:36.167 --> 24:39.770
A farmer's wife sets pancakes
on the kitchen table.

24:39.804 --> 24:42.539
She puts a pat
of margarine on top.

24:42.573 --> 24:46.175
Then sets the dish down next
to the yellowest fried eggs,

24:46.209 --> 24:47.977
a loaf of homemade bread,

24:48.012 --> 24:51.014
<i>and a beading pitcher</i>
<i>of heavy cream.</i>

24:51.048 --> 24:53.883
Syrup pours.

24:53.918 --> 24:58.287
A smile comes over
their Dorothea Lange faces.

24:58.321 --> 25:00.956
Two things-- cows

25:00.990 --> 25:02.724
because she's a dairy
farmer's wife,

25:02.759 --> 25:04.325
and I want bacon.

25:04.360 --> 25:06.494
It's not up for debate.

<i>( knocking )</i>

25:19.326 --> 25:21.318

25:43.763 --> 25:45.731
<i>( knocks )</i>
Joan: <i>Just a minute.</i>

25:47.033 --> 25:49.235
I said just a minute.

25:49.269 --> 25:51.237
I thought you said come in.

25:51.271 --> 25:54.672
I got everyone's paperwork.
I just wanted to drop them off.

25:54.707 --> 25:56.441
You look a little wan.

25:56.476 --> 25:58.143
I think I have food poisoning.

25:58.177 --> 25:59.877
Do you want some ice water?

25:59.912 --> 26:02.380
Oh! God...

26:04.283 --> 26:06.284
Do you have your appendix?

26:06.319 --> 26:09.453
- It's the other side.
- You can't stay here.

26:09.488 --> 26:11.522
And I can't leave, either.

26:16.094 --> 26:19.363
Just walk with me and I'll
bother you all the way out.

26:19.397 --> 26:21.732
No one will know.

26:30.341 --> 26:32.308
So I get the laxative
people into the booth

26:32.343 --> 26:34.844
and I record three
or four spots at one time.

26:34.878 --> 26:37.046
Who talked Topaz
into television?

26:37.080 --> 26:39.549
I did, but then
Margie took it over.

26:39.583 --> 26:42.083
The client still
calls me Peggy.

26:42.118 --> 26:44.153
Everybody, everybody.

26:44.187 --> 26:45.787
I'm taking a survey.

26:45.821 --> 26:49.491
It's Eugene McCarthy
versus Bobby Kennedy.

26:49.526 --> 26:51.426
How many for Kennedy?

26:51.461 --> 26:53.595
Show of hands.

26:53.630 --> 26:55.997
But Humphrey
has all the delegates.

26:56.032 --> 26:57.365
I'm voting for Nixon.

26:57.399 --> 26:59.300
Oh, I knew it, Mathis.

26:59.334 --> 27:01.769
<i>What's wrong with you?</i>

27:01.803 --> 27:04.438
Don't you have any hope?

27:05.874 --> 27:07.341
I'm for Bobby.

27:07.376 --> 27:10.511
Well, I... Ted?

27:11.913 --> 27:13.480
You okay?

27:16.250 --> 27:17.950
Why don't you call it a day?

27:17.985 --> 27:20.620
Come on.

27:20.655 --> 27:23.190
- What about him?
- Let him sleep it off.

27:27.861 --> 27:29.662
Ted, come on.

27:29.696 --> 27:31.763
I'm fine.

27:38.002 --> 27:39.603
<i>( man coughing )</i>

27:39.637 --> 27:41.738
<i>( woman talking over PA )</i>

27:48.479 --> 27:50.513
Drink that.

27:50.547 --> 27:53.983
- Is that urine?
- It's the pipes.

27:54.017 --> 27:55.951
The babysitter's
agreed to stay,

27:55.986 --> 27:58.954
but no word from your
mother, so I'm not leaving.

27:58.989 --> 28:01.389
She's probably still
in the Catskills.

28:01.424 --> 28:03.358
Remember Rip Van Winkle?

28:03.392 --> 28:04.892
You like that story?

28:04.927 --> 28:07.028
I know it.
I could tell it to you.

28:07.062 --> 28:09.831
No, you should go.

28:09.865 --> 28:12.267
Who knows what 20 years
will do to this place.

28:12.301 --> 28:14.702
I have no place to go.

28:18.406 --> 28:21.275
What's gonna happen to Kevin?

28:21.309 --> 28:23.910
He'll either end up
with my mother

28:23.945 --> 28:25.879
or Greg's parents.

28:25.913 --> 28:27.748
It's just food poisoning.

28:27.782 --> 28:29.416
( groans )

28:31.520 --> 28:33.119
No, that's not what it is.

28:33.154 --> 28:35.221
Come on.
Let's go.

28:35.256 --> 28:36.789
I've got you.

28:44.064 --> 28:47.200
Excuse me,
Nurse... Finnegan.

28:47.234 --> 28:49.801
I see how busy you are, but
can I trouble you a moment?

28:49.835 --> 28:52.037
Doctors will see you
the moment they can.

28:52.071 --> 28:53.805
No, it's not about that.

28:53.839 --> 28:56.542
It's just, well,
I'm such a fool

28:56.576 --> 28:58.743
and I suppose I was
trying to be a gentleman,

28:58.778 --> 29:01.446
- but my friend here, she--
- Don't.

29:01.481 --> 29:03.915
We don't need to see a doctor.

29:03.949 --> 29:07.285
I'm sure it's something that would be
covered by your medical expertise.

29:07.319 --> 29:09.420
What are you talking about?

29:09.454 --> 29:11.222
She's a little embarrassed,

29:11.256 --> 29:13.491
but she drank furniture polish.

29:13.525 --> 29:15.293
Honey, why'd you do that?

29:15.327 --> 29:18.429
She wasn't wearing her glasses.

29:18.463 --> 29:21.198
You do need to see a doctor.
Why didn't you tell me that?

29:21.199 --> 29:22.799
I'm sorry. I really
never know what to do.

29:22.800 --> 29:24.267
I thought I'd just
leave it up to you.

29:24.302 --> 29:27.070
Okay, sweetheart.
Ramirez.

29:28.239 --> 29:30.106
Take her to bed four.

29:30.140 --> 29:32.209
<i>( woman speaking over PA )</i>

29:33.311 --> 29:35.111
She'll be fine.

29:38.715 --> 29:40.749
<i>( lock clicking )</i>

29:54.563 --> 29:56.531
You look perfect.

29:56.565 --> 29:59.166
Well, I had three hours
to get ready.

29:59.201 --> 30:01.236
I don't know if the shoes go.

30:01.270 --> 30:02.803
They do.

30:06.908 --> 30:08.609
Where are we going?

30:09.944 --> 30:11.978
We're not going anywhere.

30:12.012 --> 30:13.747
Are you kidding me?

30:13.781 --> 30:16.450
Why would you think
you're going anywhere?

30:16.484 --> 30:18.785
You are for me.

30:18.819 --> 30:22.356
You exist in this room
for my pleasure.

30:24.558 --> 30:26.425
Are we going to eat?

30:26.460 --> 30:28.561
Don't ask any more questions.

30:28.595 --> 30:30.062
Take off your dress.

30:31.931 --> 30:34.833
Take off everything for me.

31:08.166 --> 31:10.133
Like that?

31:34.590 --> 31:37.326
<i>( thunder rumbling )</i>

31:48.337 --> 31:50.304
I think you look
worse than I do.

31:52.574 --> 31:54.575
Well, I slept on
the floor of my office.

31:54.609 --> 31:56.276
They didn't give you a couch?

31:56.311 --> 31:59.213
I couldn't find it.
Draper knocked me out.

31:59.247 --> 32:01.314
Not literally.

32:01.349 --> 32:04.984
I'm sure there's
a lot of work to do.

32:05.018 --> 32:06.953
It's got nothing
to do with work.

32:06.987 --> 32:09.722
He seems more interested in me
than he is in the work.

32:09.756 --> 32:11.890
But you're not
very interesting.

32:11.924 --> 32:14.727
He doesn't know that.

32:15.795 --> 32:17.295
What's he like?

32:19.666 --> 32:22.033
He's mysterious.

32:22.068 --> 32:24.235
But I can't tell
if he's putting it on.

32:25.771 --> 32:27.605
He doesn't talk
for long stretches,

32:27.639 --> 32:30.307
and then he's
incredibly eloquent.

32:30.342 --> 32:32.910
He's very successful.

32:32.944 --> 32:35.680
You didn't think
he was charmless, did you?

32:35.714 --> 32:37.715
You learned to work with me.

32:37.750 --> 32:39.283
And look at you.

32:41.318 --> 32:43.420
If I wait patiently
by the river,

32:43.454 --> 32:45.922
the body of my enemy
will float by.

32:45.956 --> 32:49.125
( sighs )
Such a waste of energy.

32:49.159 --> 32:52.596
Give him the early rounds.
He'll tire himself out.

32:55.733 --> 32:58.334
Go home, shower,

32:58.369 --> 33:01.737
walk back in there
like you own half the place.

33:20.256 --> 33:22.257
I'll be back at dinnertime.

33:22.292 --> 33:23.825
Because you live here.

33:23.859 --> 33:25.294
No, I don't.

33:25.328 --> 33:26.895
There's a hamper
full of laundry

33:26.930 --> 33:28.629
and a razor in the sink.

33:28.663 --> 33:30.264
Is Trudy finished with you?

33:30.299 --> 33:31.799
This is our pied-à-terre.

33:31.833 --> 33:33.734
Does your father
bring prostitutes here

33:33.768 --> 33:35.202
or is it just for yours?

33:35.237 --> 33:36.770
I want to be taken home.

33:36.805 --> 33:39.340
Your apartment's
been overrun with vermin.

33:39.374 --> 33:40.975
They're spraying all day.

33:41.009 --> 33:43.144
Oh.

33:43.178 --> 33:46.112
I didn't remember that.
I want to get my things.

33:46.147 --> 33:49.782
It's raining very hard out
and it's, well--

33:49.817 --> 33:51.717
it's St. Patrick's Day.

33:51.752 --> 33:54.354
- It's May.
- No, it's not.

33:55.889 --> 33:57.690
And who knows what's out there?

34:00.393 --> 34:03.728
I'll have the cook make
your favorite for dinner.

34:07.600 --> 34:09.101
<i>( door closes )</i>

34:23.955 --> 34:27.556
- Morning.
- You look fresh.

34:27.591 --> 34:29.726
Where's my secretary?

34:29.761 --> 34:31.592
Or is this how
they do it at CGC,

34:31.628 --> 34:33.495
just let yourself in?

34:33.530 --> 34:34.964
I didn't want to wait out there

34:34.998 --> 34:37.967
because this whole visit
is confidential.

34:38.001 --> 34:39.802
You want to quit already?

34:42.205 --> 34:44.072
When you told me
about the merger,

34:44.107 --> 34:46.308
I hoped he would
rub off on you,

34:46.342 --> 34:48.409
not the other way around.

34:48.443 --> 34:50.911
He's getting
everything he wants

34:50.946 --> 34:53.380
and obviously
you're on his side.

34:53.415 --> 34:55.684
Why did you do it at all
if there are sides?

34:55.717 --> 34:57.318
You could have just tried
to hire me back.

34:57.352 --> 34:58.853
You never even
asked me to lunch.

34:58.888 --> 35:02.923
Yes, Peggy, we risked
our entire company

35:02.957 --> 35:05.258
just so I could have you in
this office complaining again.

35:05.293 --> 35:07.494
Well, he can't drink like you.

35:07.528 --> 35:08.996
And you must know that
because nobody can.

35:09.030 --> 35:11.464
- Peggy, he's a grown man.
- So are you.

35:12.567 --> 35:14.001
Move forward.

35:17.305 --> 35:18.771
<i>( door closes )</i>

35:20.240 --> 35:22.541
You're going to be fine.
With Burt Peterson gone,

35:22.576 --> 35:24.476
Kenny in Detroit, everything's
going to fall in your in-box.

35:24.511 --> 35:26.045
What about Cutler?

35:26.080 --> 35:27.513
What about every time
there's a change around here,

35:27.547 --> 35:29.182
I get knocked down
to a worse office?

35:29.216 --> 35:31.184
( knocks ) Come in, Scarlett.

35:31.218 --> 35:33.786
Mr. Campbell,
I'm sorry to interrupt,

35:33.821 --> 35:35.220
but you're needed on the phone.

35:35.254 --> 35:36.822
What now, Clara?

35:38.490 --> 35:40.525
Is she injured?

35:40.559 --> 35:42.327
No, but there's been a fire.

35:42.361 --> 35:44.830
( sighs ) Call Henry at Mohawk.
See if he can meet tomorrow.

35:44.864 --> 35:47.165
I have no idea how long
this will take.

35:47.200 --> 35:50.135
Trudy?

35:50.169 --> 35:51.635
<i>( door closes )</i>

35:53.338 --> 35:55.305
<i>( rain pattering )</i>

35:58.076 --> 36:00.510
I don't know what it is.

36:00.545 --> 36:03.447
I just don't want
to think about anything.

36:03.481 --> 36:05.716
Who told you
you were allowed to think?

36:11.422 --> 36:15.792
So, what do I do now?

36:18.363 --> 36:21.265
You fall asleep
the minute I close that door.

36:22.667 --> 36:24.533
I'm flying upstate,

36:24.568 --> 36:28.237
and when I come back,
I want you ready for me.

36:30.507 --> 36:33.208
I can do that
standing on my head.

36:41.817 --> 36:43.652
And I'm taking this.

36:44.787 --> 36:47.722
Really?
Come on.

36:47.757 --> 36:49.491
I'm taking it.

36:54.029 --> 36:56.530
Something's come up.
Do you have a minute for Clara?

36:57.565 --> 36:59.566
Pete Campbell's secretary.

36:59.601 --> 37:01.502
Certainly.

37:03.805 --> 37:06.774
Mr. Campbell had an emergency
and Mr. Draper is out,

37:06.808 --> 37:08.909
so I wanted to make sure you
knew that we were rescheduling

37:08.943 --> 37:10.444
this afternoon's
meeting with Mohawk.

37:10.478 --> 37:12.011
Absolutely not.

37:12.045 --> 37:13.513
What the hell
is going on around here?

37:13.547 --> 37:15.315
( knocks ) Ready to go?

37:15.349 --> 37:17.983
I am, but apparently Pete
Campbell wants to move it.

37:18.018 --> 37:20.419
We can't cancel
the meeting to show a client

37:20.453 --> 37:22.354
how important he is.
When can he go?

37:22.388 --> 37:23.989
It doesn't matter. We should
go up there right away.

37:24.024 --> 37:26.591
It's raining pretty hard.
We can wait a couple hours.

37:26.626 --> 37:30.462
Don't worry about that. Once we're above
the clouds, it's sunny as summer.

37:33.166 --> 37:35.166
( plane rattling )

37:38.370 --> 37:40.104
How long have you
been doing this?

37:40.139 --> 37:41.840
Not now.

37:52.483 --> 37:54.351
There we go.

37:54.385 --> 37:56.753
You can relax now.
We're leveled off.

37:58.389 --> 38:00.523
I am relaxed.

38:02.360 --> 38:04.862
( rattles )

38:06.463 --> 38:08.464
Sometimes when you're flying,

38:08.498 --> 38:11.033
you think you're right side up,
but you're really upside down.

38:12.369 --> 38:14.337
Really?

38:14.371 --> 38:16.339
Got to watch your instruments.

38:25.281 --> 38:28.850
You don't want to take in
the wonder of God's majesty?

38:28.885 --> 38:32.053
I like to read on planes.
I don't like to talk.

38:32.088 --> 38:33.821
But you're gonna talk
to Henry Lammott.

38:33.856 --> 38:35.857
I mean, you're the one
that knows him.

38:35.892 --> 38:38.292
Does it matter?

38:38.326 --> 38:40.127
No matter what I say,

38:40.161 --> 38:42.863
you're the guy who flew us
up here in his own plane.

38:44.599 --> 38:46.833
I guess that's true.

38:53.441 --> 38:55.441
I don't know if Joanie's awake.

38:55.475 --> 38:57.110
I really don't need to see her.

38:57.144 --> 38:59.078
You can just give
Kevin my gift.

39:01.748 --> 39:03.950
Oh. Oh.

39:05.085 --> 39:07.353
( chuckles ) Hello.

39:07.388 --> 39:09.422
I really wasn't planning
on dropping in.

39:11.190 --> 39:13.926
I just wanted to see
if you were feeling better.

39:13.960 --> 39:17.262
The hospital wouldn't tell me anything
because I'm not immediate family.

39:17.297 --> 39:19.097
He's two years old.
He'll play with the bow.

39:19.132 --> 39:21.366
- ( laughs )
- Sit down. Have a snack.

39:21.401 --> 39:24.269
No, that's all. Don't want to be
away from the office too long.

39:24.304 --> 39:26.437
Although I left
my overcoat on my chair,

39:26.471 --> 39:28.906
so they know I'm there.

39:28.941 --> 39:32.944
Well, it's nice meeting you.

39:39.217 --> 39:41.085
He's adorable.

39:41.119 --> 39:43.186
He's too young.

39:43.220 --> 39:45.055
I can tell you from experience

39:45.089 --> 39:47.857
that younger men are not
intimidated by powerful women.

39:47.891 --> 39:51.194
- He's not interested.
- He saved your life.

39:51.228 --> 39:53.529
It was just a cyst on my ovary.

39:53.564 --> 39:56.899
I would have been fine.
He's worrying about his job.

39:56.934 --> 39:59.301
Well, why wouldn't he?

39:59.336 --> 40:01.403
It doesn't take away
what he did.

40:01.438 --> 40:03.638
Honestly, Joan, every good deed

40:03.673 --> 40:05.607
is not part of a plan.

40:10.513 --> 40:13.315
She left the teakettle on.
It was mostly smoke.

40:13.350 --> 40:15.416
Can you get Henry Lammott
on the phone?

40:18.520 --> 40:21.322
I will, but Mr. Lammott
already called for you.

40:21.357 --> 40:23.924
Don and Ted thought
it was best not to wait.

40:23.959 --> 40:26.760
Really?
They went without me?

40:26.795 --> 40:29.930
Yes. Apparently it
went very well.

40:29.965 --> 40:32.565
Damn it, Clara.
They went without me.

40:32.600 --> 40:34.968
Therefore, it did not
go very well.

40:35.003 --> 40:38.638
You do understand that your
employment here is tied to me?

40:38.672 --> 40:40.307
And if things
happen without me,

40:40.341 --> 40:42.342
they'll eventually
happen without you.

40:45.546 --> 40:47.480
Don't feel bad that you were
taking care of your mother.

40:47.514 --> 40:49.515
My mother can go to hell.

40:49.549 --> 40:51.517
Ted Chaough can fly her there.

40:51.551 --> 40:54.286
Do you want me to get
Mr. Lammott on the phone?

40:54.321 --> 40:57.456
Can you give me a minute?

41:00.060 --> 41:01.627
<i>( door closes )</i>

41:10.100 --> 41:12.101
I'm here.

41:16.071 --> 41:18.239
Where are you going?

41:19.441 --> 41:21.308
I think it's time to go home.

41:21.343 --> 41:22.744
Not yet.

41:22.778 --> 41:25.346
I think this is over.

41:25.380 --> 41:29.050
It's over when I say it's over.

41:33.354 --> 41:37.124
I had a dream that you
crashed in that plane.

41:39.060 --> 41:41.494
But I'm back.

41:41.529 --> 41:43.063
I dreamt I went to your funeral

41:43.097 --> 41:44.765
and Megan cried on my shoulder.

41:44.799 --> 41:48.901
- Stop it.
- And then I went back to Arnold

41:48.935 --> 41:52.171
and I made love to him
and I said,

41:52.205 --> 41:55.941
"I've been away,
but I'm home."

41:55.976 --> 41:58.744
It means you missed me.

42:00.781 --> 42:02.581
No.

42:05.918 --> 42:09.420
It means it's time
to really go home.

42:11.824 --> 42:14.059
This is over,

42:14.093 --> 42:16.094
and not just this.

42:27.338 --> 42:30.107
It's easy to give up something
when you're satisfied.

42:31.910 --> 42:33.744
It's easy to give up something

42:33.778 --> 42:35.579
when you're ashamed.

42:42.219 --> 42:44.286
Please.

42:56.632 --> 42:58.433
Let's go.

43:32.399 --> 43:34.868
Burt Peterson's gone.
That leaves me,

43:34.902 --> 43:37.036
Jim Torkelson,
and Lawrence Harris.

43:37.071 --> 43:40.172
You've got Roger, Pete,
Ken, and Bob Benson.

43:40.206 --> 43:42.507
But you've got your creatives
Peggy, Cecil, and Beanie.

43:42.541 --> 43:44.476
We lost Margie, Koch,
and Steve Hagan.

43:44.510 --> 43:46.812
I don't know who Peggy
counts for, but we need Bob.

43:46.846 --> 43:50.248
Bob's got to go.
Last hired, first fired.

43:54.853 --> 43:57.889
Very well.

43:57.923 --> 44:00.892
But before I cross him off,
let me remind you

44:00.926 --> 44:03.060
that Bob has been very
involved in Ken's accounts,

44:03.095 --> 44:05.128
and with Ken servicing Detroit,

44:05.163 --> 44:06.629
I don't know how long it'll
take Lawrence to catch up.

44:06.664 --> 44:08.865
Fine, Lawrence is gone.
Are we done here?

44:11.269 --> 44:14.370
The secretarial staff?

44:14.405 --> 44:16.572
<i>( elevator humming )</i>

44:29.686 --> 44:31.520
<i>( elevator bell dings )</i>

44:50.306 --> 44:52.206
And instead of being afraid,

44:52.240 --> 44:55.775
I realized I should just ask
for a couple of weeks off.

44:55.810 --> 44:58.946
They write people out
all the time.

44:58.980 --> 45:01.014
Or I could shoot in advance

45:01.049 --> 45:03.383
and maybe we could go
to Honolulu again.

45:03.417 --> 45:05.819
<i>This time without business.</i>

45:05.854 --> 45:08.787
I just thought it would
be fun to go on a trip,

45:08.822 --> 45:11.423
the two of us for a bit
without the kids.

45:11.458 --> 45:14.293
( voice fades out )

45:27.139 --> 45:29.140
Peter.

45:29.175 --> 45:31.276
They shot
that poor Kennedy boy.

45:31.310 --> 45:33.144
That was years ago, Mother.

45:33.179 --> 45:35.513
I just saw it
on the television.

45:36.749 --> 45:38.449
( sighs )
It's 6:00 AM.

45:38.484 --> 45:40.684
You'll be late for school.

45:40.718 --> 45:42.452
Please just let me sleep.

45:42.487 --> 45:45.555
I don't understand
what's going on.

45:45.590 --> 45:47.657
They're shooting everybody.

45:49.594 --> 45:51.795
Reporter:
<i>Senator Kennedy then going off</i>

45:51.829 --> 45:54.899
