00:02.070 --> 00:04.638
WOMAN: Paul's been having
a difficult time of late.

00:11.912 --> 00:14.548
FX presents Baskets.

00:14.582 --> 00:16.650
MAN: Get on with it!

00:20.020 --> 00:22.056
MRS. BASKETS:
This is Sleepy.

00:22.090 --> 00:23.824
-He's a sign spinner.
!

00:23.857 --> 00:25.393
Mom has me, uh,
working front of house.

00:25.426 --> 00:27.561
Face it-- you got demoted.

00:27.595 --> 00:28.829
MRS. BASKETS:
We need a big finale.

00:28.862 --> 00:31.232
Fireworks are always
a crowd-pleaser.

00:31.265 --> 00:32.333
I'll buy two

00:32.366 --> 00:33.767
on my personal credit card.

00:33.801 --> 00:35.403
Two!

00:35.436 --> 00:37.205
-Mother!

00:41.709 --> 00:43.244
Oh?

00:53.121 --> 00:54.588
Shh, shh.

00:54.622 --> 00:57.258
Oh, my God. Oh, hi.

01:02.062 --> 01:04.031
I love this hymn.

01:04.064 --> 01:05.466
-I know.
-It's horrible!

01:05.499 --> 01:07.067
-I had to throw my dress away!
-It was a shame.

01:07.101 --> 01:09.203
And I'm still picking lobster
out of my hair.

01:09.237 --> 01:11.305
-I bet. I know.

01:11.339 --> 01:14.142
Hi, girls! Happy Sunday!

01:14.175 --> 01:16.277
-Oh, hi.

01:16.310 --> 01:19.447
-JOAN: I'm so sorry I was
in your seat before. -Oh.

01:19.480 --> 01:21.482
I would have moved
for you, Christine.

01:21.515 --> 01:23.317
!
-Sure.

01:23.351 --> 01:25.419
-Oh.

01:25.453 --> 01:27.621
It is my church, you know.

01:27.655 --> 01:30.924
I'd love to do
the collection plate next week.

01:30.958 --> 01:33.594
Hey, did you all enjoy yourself

01:33.627 --> 01:35.263
at the opera night?

01:35.296 --> 01:38.466
It was glorious! I mean,
the music and the fireworks

01:38.499 --> 01:41.269
-and... your smiling face.
-Oh.

01:41.302 --> 01:44.272
MAGGIE: Well, you know who
wasn't smiling? My dry cleaner.

01:44.305 --> 01:46.907
You'd think he'd never seen a
fire extinguisher stain before.

01:48.342 --> 01:51.345
Uh-huh. Well, I'll fix that.

01:51.379 --> 01:53.581
I'll get you a steamer cleaner
from the SkyMall.

01:53.614 --> 01:55.249
-Oh, for heaven's sakes.
-Oh.

01:55.283 --> 01:56.817
-Don't even think about it.
-Don't worry about it.

01:56.850 --> 01:58.118
-We love you, darling.
-We're gonna see you

01:58.152 --> 01:59.520
real soon, Christine.

01:59.553 --> 02:01.255
Sweetheart, I'll call you.

02:01.289 --> 02:02.823
Bye-bye, honey.

02:02.856 --> 02:05.759
I would love to hear your side.

02:05.793 --> 02:08.462
JIM: Christine's opera night
put you in the hole $50,000,

02:08.496 --> 02:10.464
and ticket sales
are doing nothing.

02:10.498 --> 02:11.599
Uh-huh.

02:13.033 --> 02:16.604
I think my mom has lost
her mind, Uncle Jim.

02:16.637 --> 02:18.306
She's gonna blow
through my inheritance

02:18.339 --> 02:20.341
-before she's even dead. -Well,
that is my mother's fault.

02:20.374 --> 02:21.775
I don't know what
she was thinking,

02:21.809 --> 02:23.477
leaving Christine a lump sum.

02:23.511 --> 02:25.846
She doesn't know
the first thing about business.

02:25.879 --> 02:27.448
Yeah, but I do!
That's my point!

02:27.481 --> 02:29.217
:
I-I mean, I do.

02:29.250 --> 02:31.952
And I've tried to warn her,
but, no, no, she won't listen.

02:31.985 --> 02:34.121
She's gonna drag
the whole family down with her.

02:34.154 --> 02:36.390
Now, you were right
calling me down here.

02:36.424 --> 02:38.058
: I should have
never fronted Mama the money

02:38.091 --> 02:40.828
for those fireworks.
My back! Oh!

02:40.861 --> 02:42.496
Now, you know,
that is all in your head.

02:42.530 --> 02:44.031
What is?

02:44.064 --> 02:46.567
-Hmm.
-MRS. BASKETS: Hey.

02:46.600 --> 02:48.702
We having a meeting
without me? Hi.

02:48.736 --> 02:50.471
: Well, hello
to you, too, sister.

02:51.905 --> 02:54.308
I didn't know you were in town.

02:54.342 --> 02:55.976
-Yeah.

02:56.009 --> 02:58.546
Good, good, good. I just,
uh, thought I'd swing by

02:58.579 --> 03:01.415
on my way
to a Quiznos convention.

03:01.449 --> 03:02.983
-Oh, good.

03:03.016 --> 03:05.486
I just came in
to get my Costco card.

03:05.519 --> 03:07.888
You sure Dale didn't invite you?

03:07.921 --> 03:09.590
Oh, now I need an invitation?

03:09.623 --> 03:12.025
No, but it would be nice
to know when you're coming.

03:12.059 --> 03:13.661
You're family, you know.

03:13.694 --> 03:16.364
-We were having some doughnuts.
-Well, that's good.

03:16.397 --> 03:18.599
Why don't you come over at 4:00,

03:18.632 --> 03:20.268
and I'll make hamburger pizza?

03:20.301 --> 03:21.702
-JIM: My favorite! -(phone
buzzing, ringtone playing)

03:21.735 --> 03:23.871
It's a date, then.
Come over at 4:00.

03:23.904 --> 03:26.540
Walk me out.
I got a million things to do.

03:26.574 --> 03:29.076
-DALE: Hey, sweetie.
-Well, it's so nice to see you.

03:29.109 --> 03:30.711
Well, I can't pick you up
right now.

03:30.744 --> 03:33.547
It's the middle
of the afternoon. I'm at work.

03:33.581 --> 03:35.616
What do you mean,
"Bill can do it"

03:38.151 --> 03:40.888
You got it all figured out,
don't you, Sleepy?

03:40.921 --> 03:42.856
Oh, God.

03:42.890 --> 03:44.792
Chip, did you know
that Jim was here?

03:44.825 --> 03:47.861
Yes, he and, uh, Dale
went into your office.

03:47.895 --> 03:49.863
Why didn't you stop 'em?

03:49.897 --> 03:51.365
Was I supposed to do that?

03:51.399 --> 03:53.434
I'm front of house.
I stay in my own lane.

03:53.467 --> 03:55.936
I thought maybe you empowered
him like you did Sleepy.

03:58.606 --> 04:01.709
Chip, did you know that Nicole
is dating some buy named Bill?

04:01.742 --> 04:03.210
Yeah, the guy
from the new Froyo place?

04:03.243 --> 04:04.578
Yeah, I'd heard something
about that.

04:04.612 --> 04:06.780
Everybody knows but me!

04:06.814 --> 04:09.650
And guess who I heard it from.
My daughter.

04:09.683 --> 04:12.052
You didn't expect me
to tell you about it, right?

04:12.085 --> 04:14.588
I'm not gonna insert myself
into that situation.

04:14.622 --> 04:16.256
It's a situation?!

04:16.290 --> 04:19.126
Oh, my God.

04:26.133 --> 04:28.569
DANIEL: Give us a note,
watch me for the tempo.

04:30.938 --> 04:32.440
Bring it out more. You guys
come in and start with you.

04:32.473 --> 04:35.843
-And one, ah, ah, ah.

04:35.876 --> 04:37.811
-No-no-no-no-no. Sing. Fill...

04:37.845 --> 04:39.347
Fill the... Oh, hey. Hi!

04:39.380 --> 04:40.981
-Sorry to bother you.
-No.

04:41.014 --> 04:43.584
-Sorry to interrupt. I'm sorry.
-No, no. No, no, no.

04:43.617 --> 04:44.985
I'm trying to get these kids

04:45.018 --> 04:46.620
just to be
a little less dependent on me.

04:46.654 --> 04:48.756
-Oh. -Keep going, guys!
You can do it... without me.

04:48.789 --> 04:52.626
-Uh... oh, it's a mess.

04:52.660 --> 04:56.029
Um, I need some tips
on running a family business.

04:56.063 --> 04:59.367
My son brought my brother in

04:59.400 --> 05:03.170
who owns a couple of, uh,
Quiznos franchises,

05:03.203 --> 05:05.539
-and now...

05:05.573 --> 05:09.209
I mean,
maybe he knows something

05:09.242 --> 05:12.145
-about the business.
-Uh...

05:12.179 --> 05:15.449
-Well, maybe it is all my pride.

05:15.483 --> 05:19.853
It is only a rodeo, after all,
but...

05:19.887 --> 05:21.655
Is that a song I would know?

05:21.689 --> 05:23.323
That hymn-- it sounded so...

05:23.357 --> 05:25.359
Oh, this is a new song.
See, they-they write

05:25.393 --> 05:26.827
all their own material.

05:26.860 --> 05:28.796
Some of these kids are super,
super talented.

05:28.829 --> 05:30.398
Not... not that one or that one,

05:30.431 --> 05:32.366
but... but the ones
on the outside of the piano--

05:32.400 --> 05:35.035
they-they're pretty good.
Just kidding.

05:35.068 --> 05:38.406
-Oh. -Wait, wait, wait.
Oh, I got... Mm. Okay. So,

05:38.439 --> 05:40.974
these are, um, hymn templates,
and you just...

05:41.008 --> 05:43.243
The next time you're tossing
and turning at night,

05:43.276 --> 05:44.878
you have an idea, and you think,

05:44.912 --> 05:46.747
"Hey, that would make
a good hymn," jot it down.

05:46.780 --> 05:49.917
Christine, I can't wait to see
what comes out of your mind.

05:49.950 --> 05:51.519
Oh, thank you.
I feel much better.

05:51.552 --> 05:53.487
Thank you so much
for talking to me.

05:53.521 --> 05:55.856
-I should let you get back
to the... -Okay.

05:55.889 --> 05:58.659
-Door's open any time. Any time.
-Oh, you're a lifesaver.

05:58.692 --> 06:00.227
-And, hey... -The whole thing--
beautiful, though.

06:00.260 --> 06:02.029
:
But thank you for this.

06:02.062 --> 06:03.597
All right.
Door's always open, okay?

06:03.631 --> 06:05.065
-Always open.
-Okay.

06:05.098 --> 06:07.067
*

06:07.100 --> 06:09.002
MRS. BASKETS:
Just how

06:09.036 --> 06:11.038
you like it, Jim, on the rocks.

06:12.606 --> 06:14.775
You've been losing weight,
Christine?

06:14.808 --> 06:16.944
Well, maybe from all
the running around at work.

06:16.977 --> 06:18.512
:
Who knows?

06:18.546 --> 06:20.514
: Like a chicken
with your head cut off?

06:20.548 --> 06:23.551
More like a bull
in a China shop.

06:23.584 --> 06:26.887
:
Or a bull at the rodeo.

06:26.920 --> 06:29.857
-Well, don't have a cow.

06:29.890 --> 06:32.793
Geez.

06:32.826 --> 06:36.196
I really have to make
this rodeo thing work, Jim.

06:36.229 --> 06:38.031
I'm here for you, sis.

06:38.065 --> 06:40.601
You just keep putting
one foot in front of the other.

06:40.634 --> 06:44.538
If you get overwhelmed,
you're no use to anybody.

06:44.572 --> 06:46.607
-Hmm.

06:46.640 --> 06:48.942
Uh, isn't that right, Chip?

06:48.976 --> 06:52.546
Yeah. Wait.
What am I agreeing to?

06:52.580 --> 06:55.282
Well, your uncle thinks
that I'm too emotional

06:55.315 --> 06:58.586
when it comes to business,
and, um,

06:58.619 --> 07:00.420
he's got a lot more experience,

07:00.454 --> 07:02.956
and he's giving me
some sage advice.

07:02.990 --> 07:05.292
So, I'm all ears, Jim.

07:05.325 --> 07:08.161
I can help you out best I can,

07:08.195 --> 07:10.130
you know, with my experience.

07:10.163 --> 07:12.232
I'm a college graduate.

07:12.265 --> 07:13.901
Didn't you go to DeVry?

07:13.934 --> 07:17.771
-It's a college.
-It's accredited.

07:19.607 --> 07:23.110
FEMALE VOICE: Welcome to Frobot,
the yogurt of the future.

07:23.143 --> 07:25.245
I am a robot ready to serve up

07:25.278 --> 07:27.781
-some delicious frozen yogurt.
Come on up.

07:27.815 --> 07:30.784
FEMALE VOICE: Tap for flavors,
tap for toppings.

07:30.818 --> 07:33.020
Can your dad give us
extra toppings?

07:33.053 --> 07:36.356
That is not her dad.
I am her dad, okay?

07:36.389 --> 07:38.125
-He is not.

07:38.158 --> 07:39.660
I thought you couldn't
give me a ride.

07:39.693 --> 07:41.995
Well, I came to buy you
and your friend--

07:42.029 --> 07:43.631
whose name I can't remember--

07:43.664 --> 07:46.099
some extra toppings
for your frogurt.

07:46.133 --> 07:48.101
Is it Denise?

07:48.135 --> 07:50.638
-No. It's Hannah.
-Hannah. Hannah.

07:50.671 --> 07:52.940
-You have a friend named Denise,
though. -You must be Dale.

07:52.973 --> 07:54.441
Must I be, then?
Must I be?

07:54.474 --> 07:56.209
:
Yeah, okay. I really

07:56.243 --> 07:58.612
-don't do that MTV stuff.
-Okay, okay.

07:58.646 --> 08:00.113
-Bill.

08:00.147 --> 08:01.882
-Great.
-I wanted to let you know

08:01.915 --> 08:04.384
that I gave birth to her,
and we have a lot of diabetes

08:04.417 --> 08:06.820
in the family, and I don't need
any more sugar freaks.

08:06.854 --> 08:08.522
I just want to make sure that

08:08.556 --> 08:11.559
the sugar content in the Frobot,
uh, is not too high,

08:11.592 --> 08:13.627
'cause I don't want to put her
at an early grave.

08:13.661 --> 08:16.163
Yogurt. Not too much sugar,
but, uh, sorry. Didn't know.

08:16.196 --> 08:17.731
How would you?
You barely know her.

08:17.765 --> 08:20.133
-Well, damage is done.

08:20.167 --> 08:21.201
-We're ready to shoot.
-Oh.

08:21.234 --> 08:22.870
Yeah, uh, I'm gonna go

08:22.903 --> 08:25.639
be on the news,
so, uh, excuse me.

08:25.673 --> 08:28.709
Anybody can be on television.

08:28.742 --> 08:32.212
All you have to do is rob a bank
or kick a dog.

08:32.245 --> 08:35.215
Nice to meet you.
Hey. How you doing?

08:42.255 --> 08:45.492
-Oh, you don't have to do
that, Jim. -No, I love it.

08:45.525 --> 08:47.327
-Yeah.

08:47.360 --> 08:50.030
Oh, well,
I'm gonna finish this dessert.

08:50.063 --> 08:52.365
You know, when I bought
my first franchise,

08:52.399 --> 08:53.901
I washed every dish.

08:53.934 --> 08:55.335
Opened every morning,
closed every night.

08:55.368 --> 08:57.004
Takes over your life.

08:57.037 --> 08:58.706
That's why you got to love it.

08:58.739 --> 09:00.908
You love the rodeo, Christine?

09:00.941 --> 09:03.243
Do I love the rodeo?

09:03.276 --> 09:05.178
Hmm.

09:05.212 --> 09:07.848
Well...

09:07.881 --> 09:09.950
Yeah.

09:09.983 --> 09:11.885
:
Hell yeah. Oh, yeah.

09:11.919 --> 09:15.589
-Yeah. -Well, I never thought
I'd end up owning a rodeo.

09:15.623 --> 09:18.458
:
Who does

09:18.491 --> 09:20.360
I'm just happy
to do whatever you...

09:20.393 --> 09:22.295
you need me to do.

09:22.329 --> 09:24.064
Are you, Chip?

09:24.097 --> 09:25.633
'Cause I bought it
for the family.

09:25.666 --> 09:27.367
And if I'm doing it for you

09:27.400 --> 09:29.136
and you're doing it for me,
then...

09:29.169 --> 09:30.370
Well, then,
what are we doing here?

09:30.403 --> 09:31.939
I mean, I can give you

09:31.972 --> 09:34.274
the best advice for business
in the whole world,

09:34.307 --> 09:36.810
but, uh, if you
fundamentally don't want

09:36.844 --> 09:38.245
to be in the business...

09:38.278 --> 09:39.747
Oh.

09:39.780 --> 09:42.616
Maybe I should let it go.

09:43.651 --> 09:45.719
Well, give Dale a shot.

09:45.753 --> 09:48.088
He's got a good head
on his shoulders. I'd be willing

09:48.121 --> 09:50.323
-to bet on him myself.

09:50.357 --> 09:52.125
Did you tell her yet, Uncle Jim?

09:52.159 --> 09:53.727
Tell me what?

09:53.761 --> 09:56.296
Well, Uncle Jim's gonna help me
buy back the rodeo.

09:56.329 --> 09:57.731
You know, since you messed up,

09:57.765 --> 10:00.834
I'm in, you're out.

10:04.872 --> 10:06.506
What?

10:08.541 --> 10:10.644
And here I thought we were just,

10:10.678 --> 10:12.680
you know, brother and sister.

10:12.713 --> 10:14.915
Talking about our dilemmas.

10:14.948 --> 10:16.650
We were. We are.

10:16.684 --> 10:18.018
Dale was just, uh,
getting a little,

10:18.051 --> 10:19.619
little bit ahead of himself.

10:19.653 --> 10:21.421
DALE:
No, I'm not.

10:21.454 --> 10:23.590
I fronted you money
for fireworks,

10:23.623 --> 10:25.292
and now my kids

10:25.325 --> 10:27.260
are hanging out
with some guy named Bill

10:27.294 --> 10:30.097
who kind of buys them off
with yogurt toppings!

10:30.130 --> 10:31.331
You can't count

10:31.364 --> 10:33.433
the one time you lent me money

10:33.466 --> 10:35.703
against all the times
I wiped your butt

10:35.736 --> 10:37.137
and fed you boys.

10:37.170 --> 10:39.673
-Taught you the ABCs.

10:39.707 --> 10:41.942
What about my sweat equity?

10:41.975 --> 10:45.345
"Sweat equity"?

10:45.378 --> 10:47.447
Someone's been watching
Suze Orman.

10:47.480 --> 10:49.182
DALE: Well, what a-- what a--
what about the sweat equity

10:49.216 --> 10:51.151
I put in with my kids?

10:51.184 --> 10:53.320
If that's legal tender here
in the town of Bakersfield,

10:53.353 --> 10:56.156
then, uh, maybe I can use it
for-for child support

10:56.189 --> 10:57.825
when I pick up my girls
on Saturday.

10:57.858 --> 11:00.160
My... my back's hurting.

11:00.193 --> 11:01.995
It hurts. I'm stressed.

11:02.029 --> 11:03.663
What do you think, Chip?

11:03.697 --> 11:06.199
Should I let Dale
run the business now?

11:06.233 --> 11:09.402
CHIP:
Mother, I'm trying to urinate.

11:41.601 --> 11:43.570
So, all of a sudden
my opinion counts, huh?

11:43.603 --> 11:45.438
I thought I was just, you know,

11:45.472 --> 11:48.241
-front of house.
-Don't say "front of house."

11:48.275 --> 11:52.079
If you have a new routine,
I'd love to see it.

11:52.112 --> 11:53.947
My door's always open to you.

11:53.981 --> 11:55.749
Oh, great, so I get to audition
for you anytime?

11:55.783 --> 11:57.417
Wonderful career news, Mom.

11:57.450 --> 11:59.953
That's sarcasm, by the way.

11:59.987 --> 12:02.055
I think I know that.

12:02.089 --> 12:04.557
DALE:
Hey, Chip.

12:04.591 --> 12:05.893
We'll put you right on stage.

12:05.926 --> 12:07.427
Really?

12:07.460 --> 12:08.896
We will.

12:08.929 --> 12:10.297
Ain't that right, U.J.?

12:10.330 --> 12:12.699
Uh, we believe in your clowning.

12:12.732 --> 12:14.534
You're-you're family.

12:14.567 --> 12:16.436
Well, I'm hearing
some interesting things

12:16.469 --> 12:18.138
from Uncle Jim and Dale, Mom.

12:18.171 --> 12:21.541
Well, I'm not getting
into a bidding war

12:21.574 --> 12:23.944
over my own son.

12:23.977 --> 12:26.246
Fine.

12:26.279 --> 12:28.949
Bring the-- that. Thank you.

12:28.982 --> 12:31.118
Why don't you just sell me
the rodeo, Christine?

12:31.151 --> 12:32.585
I mean, you even said,

12:32.619 --> 12:36.256
you know, it was never
a business decision.

12:36.289 --> 12:39.292
Why are you really interested
in the rodeo?

12:39.326 --> 12:42.229
It's emotional with you,
isn't it?

12:42.262 --> 12:44.832
You don't care
about the business.

12:44.865 --> 12:47.801
You're trying to buy the rodeo
from your sister

12:47.835 --> 12:49.803
because you're mad
at your dead mother.

12:49.837 --> 12:52.840
I came here
to fix this for you.

12:52.873 --> 12:55.342
Emotion doesn't have
a damn thing to do with it.

12:55.375 --> 12:57.144
You know,
I-I got to get out of here.

12:57.177 --> 12:58.478
Anger's an emotion, Jim.

12:58.511 --> 13:00.413
I know it is.

13:00.447 --> 13:03.283
Don't you have
a Quiznos convention to get to?

13:03.316 --> 13:04.985
JIM:
There is no convention!

13:05.018 --> 13:06.753
I know!

13:10.657 --> 13:12.125
Oh, damn.

13:12.159 --> 13:14.461
Hey, my car's behind you.
I got to move it.

13:17.664 --> 13:20.633
-Hey.

13:20.667 --> 13:22.202
-Oh, go take care of that,
please. -Oh, go get him.

13:22.235 --> 13:23.971
-Go, go, go, go, go.
Hurry. Hurry. -Quick. Quick.

13:24.004 --> 13:26.273
* Don't dare take away *

13:26.306 --> 13:28.808
* Everything that's good
in my life *

13:28.842 --> 13:30.110
* Every little thing... *

13:30.143 --> 13:32.112
Surprise!

13:32.145 --> 13:33.380
I'm the number one dad.

13:33.413 --> 13:34.848
It's pointing towards me.

13:34.882 --> 13:36.216
BOTH:
Hi, Dad.

13:36.249 --> 13:38.318
Get in the car.
I got a great day planned.

13:38.351 --> 13:40.487
-Bill's about to be on TV.

13:40.520 --> 13:41.955
-No. -No, not
yet. -It's that time of day,

13:41.989 --> 13:43.790
-folks, 4:00 p.m. So we
send it over -Come on, hurry.

13:43.823 --> 13:45.158
to Danielle, who spent
yesterday at Truxtun Plaza.

13:45.192 --> 13:46.826
-Come on. Dale, good looking.
-Hi, Dale.

13:46.860 --> 13:48.328
Hey, Danielle,
what did you find over there?

13:48.361 --> 13:49.529
-Some call it Froyo.

13:49.562 --> 13:51.464
Others call it frozen yogurt.

13:51.498 --> 13:53.166
But however you refer to it,

13:53.200 --> 13:54.968
it will give you brain freeze.

13:55.002 --> 13:57.537
And it's making a big splash
here in Bakersfield.

13:57.570 --> 13:59.139
I don't get it.

13:59.172 --> 14:00.473
-So, tell us about this Frobot.

14:00.507 --> 14:01.641
Where'd you get the idea?

14:01.674 --> 14:02.910
Well, it just came to me.

14:02.943 --> 14:05.045
One night, I was like, "frozen"

14:05.078 --> 14:07.915
and "robot," let's just...
let's put 'em together.

14:07.948 --> 14:09.016
DANIELLE: Well, everyone
loves frozen yogurt.

14:09.049 --> 14:10.250
At least I haven't met

14:10.283 --> 14:12.219
-anyone who doesn't.
-Oh, that's me.

14:12.252 --> 14:13.353
Reporting live
from Truxtun Plaza,

14:13.386 --> 14:14.487
I'm Danielle Mana.

14:14.521 --> 14:15.855
-Back to you, Steve.

14:17.290 --> 14:18.425
-That's all right.
-Good job. -Good job.

14:18.458 --> 14:19.826
Yeah, no, it was really good.

14:19.859 --> 14:21.394
Well, uh, the reason
I came over here,

14:21.428 --> 14:23.396
uh, th-this afternoon was, uh...

14:23.430 --> 14:24.764
Congratulations on the yogurt,
by the way,

14:24.797 --> 14:26.566
-it's a great story.
-Thank you, Dale.

14:26.599 --> 14:29.702
But I came over here to, I don't
know, hang out with the girls.

14:29.736 --> 14:31.604
-Girls, you want to go do
something? Maybe, uh... -Sure.

14:31.638 --> 14:33.173
...go hang out?
Want to do something like that?

14:33.206 --> 14:34.207
What'd you like to do?

14:34.241 --> 14:36.343
-Anything.
-BOTH: Shopping.

14:36.376 --> 14:40.180
Sh... Okay, shopping!
Let's go on a shopping spree.

14:40.213 --> 14:42.415
Big shopping spree.
All right.

14:42.449 --> 14:43.850
Then I don't feel so bad about

14:43.883 --> 14:45.518
asking for the support check
this month.

14:45.552 --> 14:47.955
Well, why would you
feel bad about that?

14:47.988 --> 14:50.023
'Cause I love writing those.
Where's my checkbook?

14:50.057 --> 14:51.291
There it is,
'cause I always have it,

14:51.324 --> 14:52.525
'cause I always have
my checkbook,

14:52.559 --> 14:54.027
'cause I'm always
writing checks.

14:57.164 --> 14:59.933
Okay, here you go.
Ladies, let's do it.

14:59.967 --> 15:01.368
Let's go on
a shopping spree, okay?

15:01.401 --> 15:04.571
-Bye. Love you.

15:04.604 --> 15:06.806
BILL: Dale, watch those
little angels, would you?

15:06.839 --> 15:09.209
I will, Bill, thank you.
They're my angels.

15:09.242 --> 15:10.978
-Bye, Bill. -All right.
-Good job.

15:11.011 --> 15:13.080
-See you guys.
-Bye.

15:17.517 --> 15:20.787
Well, you knew Dale had
some resentments

15:20.820 --> 15:22.922
'cause of the business,
and it seems like

15:22.956 --> 15:25.325
maybe Chip has
some resentments, too.

15:25.358 --> 15:27.594
I do have some resentments.
I told her.

15:27.627 --> 15:30.897
Yeah, he does have
some resentments; he told me.

15:30.930 --> 15:34.334
Well, I'm going out.
You need anything?

15:34.367 --> 15:36.503
How about a rodeo?
That's what I got you.

15:42.175 --> 15:44.411
Well, um, actually,
it seems like

15:44.444 --> 15:47.447
maybe you have some resentments,
too, Mrs. Baskets.

15:47.480 --> 15:49.716
Maybe I do.

15:54.554 --> 15:56.756
When I start the clock,
you've got two minutes.

15:56.789 --> 15:57.790
To buy whatever we want?

15:57.824 --> 15:59.426
That's what a shopping spree is.

15:59.459 --> 16:00.660
And buy something for Snoozy.

16:00.693 --> 16:04.197
He's waiting in the car.
Okay, and... go!

16:04.231 --> 16:06.466
-Dad!
-We're not ready.

16:06.499 --> 16:10.437
One minute, 58 seconds.
Capitalism run amok!

16:10.470 --> 16:13.173
*

16:13.206 --> 16:16.143
DALE:
Shopping spree coming through.

16:16.176 --> 16:18.011
World's best dad!

16:18.045 --> 16:20.047
*

16:21.148 --> 16:23.050
30 seconds.

16:23.083 --> 16:24.684
Stay cool.
That's plenty of time.

16:24.717 --> 16:26.519
Keep going.
Grab those socks.

16:26.553 --> 16:29.122
And... time.

16:30.357 --> 16:32.459
The charge didn't go through.

16:32.492 --> 16:34.461
Oh, try it again.

16:34.494 --> 16:37.397
That has a chip on it, also, so
I don't know if it's a swiper,

16:37.430 --> 16:38.998
-or if you just do the chip.

16:39.032 --> 16:40.467
It didn't go through.
I-I'll chip it

16:40.500 --> 16:42.169
-this time, yeah, sure.
-Okay, give it a chip.

16:42.202 --> 16:43.636
I don't know why they changed
the system on us.

16:43.670 --> 16:46.406
-I mean, the swipe seemed fine.
-Yeah.

16:46.439 --> 16:48.041
There we go.
Did that go through?

16:48.075 --> 16:49.642
Dad, we can just put it back.
We can just put it back.

16:50.943 --> 16:52.945
-Nothing.
-We could ask Bill.

16:55.248 --> 16:58.551
Um... Mama bought
some fireworks.

16:58.585 --> 17:00.887
:
Mama...

17:00.920 --> 17:02.722
-Oh.

17:02.755 --> 17:05.058
And, uh, she-she's spending
a lot of money

17:05.092 --> 17:07.727
-on shit we don't need.

17:07.760 --> 17:09.929
-Oh, okay.
-Dad.

17:09.962 --> 17:11.264
-I'm so sorry. -That's okay.
I have to suck it up.

17:11.298 --> 17:13.900
If you'll just put these
on hold, because my mom,

17:13.933 --> 17:15.502
again, has bought a rodeo

17:15.535 --> 17:18.071
and has left me with nothing
but freaking firework...

17:19.572 --> 17:20.907
-Okay, so we're gonna go.
-Yeah.

17:20.940 --> 17:22.842
We're gonna leave, okay?

17:22.875 --> 17:24.411
-So you can just work out your
issues.

17:24.444 --> 17:26.045
-And...
-Go to the food court.

17:26.079 --> 17:28.748
The food court is not the answer
to all your problems!

17:28.781 --> 17:31.418
:
My back, my back, my back.

17:31.451 --> 17:34.287
-It smarts
a little bit. It does smart.

17:34.321 --> 17:37.090
S... S...

17:37.124 --> 17:39.159
-Ow!

17:41.794 --> 17:46.199
Well... you ruined my date
with my daughters.

17:46.233 --> 17:49.269
What are you talking about?

17:49.302 --> 17:50.937
Do you have my money?

17:50.970 --> 17:52.872
What are you...
Sit down.

17:52.905 --> 17:54.574
I made some fudge.

17:54.607 --> 17:56.576
I don't want any fudge, Mother.

17:56.609 --> 18:00.147
Dale, this has walnuts in it.

18:00.180 --> 18:01.748
I don't want walnutted fudge.

18:01.781 --> 18:03.216
Have a piece of fudge.

18:03.250 --> 18:06.553
I don't want any fudge! Period!

18:06.586 --> 18:09.789
Stop this-this crap
about the fudge!

18:09.822 --> 18:12.659
Well, I guess you don't.

18:14.927 --> 18:17.430
Where are the girls?
They like fudge.

18:17.464 --> 18:20.400
Mom, will you please
stop talking about fudge?

18:20.433 --> 18:21.934
Yes. Well, where are the girls?

18:21.968 --> 18:24.804
The girls are at home

18:24.837 --> 18:26.906
because I did not want...

18:26.939 --> 18:30.443
I did not want them to see
their grandmother getting sued.

18:30.477 --> 18:32.745
You can't be serious.

18:32.779 --> 18:34.781
Yep, I'm suing you, Mom,

18:34.814 --> 18:37.850
for, you know, my-my money
and my back

18:37.884 --> 18:40.653
and the, uh, deterioration
of the relationship

18:40.687 --> 18:42.189
between me and my daughters.

18:42.222 --> 18:44.357
What are you looking for?

18:44.391 --> 18:46.092
I'm looking for an "A"
or an "L". I don't know.

18:46.125 --> 18:49.095
Attorney or lawyer.
Oh... my neck.

18:49.128 --> 18:51.964
It's crept up my neck now.

18:53.333 --> 18:57.170
Fine.

18:57.204 --> 18:58.838
Take the rodeo.

18:58.871 --> 19:00.973
Well, it's about time, Mother.

19:01.007 --> 19:03.976
But if you think
I'm not gonna sue you, Mom,

19:04.010 --> 19:05.845
you're dead wrong.

19:07.714 --> 19:09.816
Yes, hello, my name is
Dale Baskets.

19:09.849 --> 19:11.718
I'd like to sue someone, please.

19:11.751 --> 19:13.186
Yes, I can hold.

19:22.061 --> 19:24.697
Chip.

19:30.603 --> 19:33.840
Um, must be coming down
with something.

19:33.873 --> 19:35.742
I feel weak as a kitten.

19:35.775 --> 19:38.044
Oh, yeah? Well, you want me
to get you something?

19:38.077 --> 19:42.382
I think I'm just a little
down in the dumps, really.

19:42.415 --> 19:45.184
If you could just
help-help me get up

19:45.218 --> 19:46.753
and push me towards
the bathroom

19:46.786 --> 19:49.256
until I get my motor revving.

19:49.289 --> 19:51.391
And then I head over
to the church

19:51.424 --> 19:53.159
and do the collection plate.

19:53.192 --> 19:54.527
-They're counting on me.
-Mom, Mom, okay, all right.

19:54.561 --> 19:56.363
Listen, just relax.
Relax, okay?

19:56.396 --> 19:58.164
-Oh...
-Just relax.

19:58.197 --> 19:59.866
Oh...

19:59.899 --> 20:03.069
I'll do it. I'll-I'll go work
the collection plate.

20:03.102 --> 20:04.871
-Yeah.

20:04.904 --> 20:06.339
I mean, it's Sunday morning.
What am I gonna do?

20:06.373 --> 20:08.241
Watch cartoons all day?

20:08.275 --> 20:11.210
Were you watching
cartoons today?

20:14.647 --> 20:18.351
Chip, you should have had
my back with Jim and Dale.

20:21.321 --> 20:23.590
Oh, Chip.

20:23.623 --> 20:25.925
We haven't seen you in church
in a long time.

20:25.958 --> 20:28.595
-Yeah, it's-it's nice
to be back. -Yeah.

20:28.628 --> 20:30.563
It hasn't changed much
since the '80s.

20:30.597 --> 20:32.899
Where's Christine?

20:32.932 --> 20:35.402
Um, she's, uh... she's not
feeling well right now.

20:35.435 --> 20:38.271
-Oh. -Oh.
-Nothing serious, I hope.

20:38.305 --> 20:41.974
No, she's...
I mean, she's just, um...

20:42.008 --> 20:45.244
she's just not feeling well.
She's laid up.

20:45.278 --> 20:46.713
Well, you know what they say.

20:46.746 --> 20:49.916
When Christine flakes,
the world scrambles.

20:49.949 --> 20:52.385
Is that a real expression?

20:52.419 --> 20:55.388
I'm sorry she made you have
this conversation with us, Chip.

20:55.422 --> 20:57.624
Tell her that Joan understands.

20:57.657 --> 20:58.958
I hope she feels better.

21:00.827 --> 21:01.794
Ladies.

21:01.828 --> 21:02.995
-Oh.
-I'm so sorry.

he makes to us, his people.

21:28.788 --> 21:30.957
For heaven's sake.

21:30.990 --> 21:34.193
Okay, who gave me the, uh, ten?

21:34.226 --> 21:36.095
-I did.
-I'm refunding your money.

21:36.128 --> 21:37.530
-Pass that down.

21:37.564 --> 21:38.965
It's for the church.

21:38.998 --> 21:40.266
Yeah, it's no good here.
They don't want it.

21:40.299 --> 21:42.535
-Pass that down.
-Oh, for heaven's sakes.

21:42.569 --> 21:44.537
Don't talk about my mom
behind her back.

21:44.571 --> 21:47.974
Then she should have the guts
to show her face here.
