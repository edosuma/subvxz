PATTON:
Oh, baby.

01:21.298 --> 01:23.257
What's that smell?

01:23.300 --> 01:25.172
That is grits.

01:25.215 --> 01:27.130
And Mama Pride's
grillades.

01:27.174 --> 01:29.089
Been 197 days
since you fixed them.

01:29.132 --> 01:31.134
Not that I'm counting.

01:31.178 --> 01:34.094
Ooh, all I need now
is the white pepper.

01:35.660 --> 01:39.534
And... we're out?

01:39.577 --> 01:41.623
Spice drawer.Spice drawer?

01:41.666 --> 01:42.972
Reorganized the kitchen.

01:43.015 --> 01:45.844
Sorry, boss.Oh, no need.

01:45.888 --> 01:47.585
Huh.

01:47.629 --> 01:49.457
I'm just a guest these days.

01:49.500 --> 01:53.025
Yeah, and a welcome one as long
as you keep cooking like that.

01:53.069 --> 01:55.158
Hey, don't take this
the wrong way.

01:55.202 --> 01:57.987
We're really happy you're back,
but have you heard from Hannah?

01:58.030 --> 01:59.641
Nothing.

01:59.684 --> 02:02.165
I'm assuming she's making
the most of her time off.

02:02.209 --> 02:04.254
Yeah, I guess.
Reconnecting with her daughter

02:04.298 --> 02:05.864
and dealing with her ex-husband.

02:05.908 --> 02:08.345
I just feel we need
to be there for her, you know?

02:08.389 --> 02:11.174
Best way we can help
is to give her some space.

02:11.218 --> 02:12.306
GREGORIO:
Agreed.

02:12.349 --> 02:13.655
Can you explain
that concept

02:13.698 --> 02:15.613
to Mr. Grabby here
while you're at it?

02:15.657 --> 02:17.311
Mr. Grabby?
That sounds... What?

02:17.354 --> 02:20.183
No, she had clothes everywhere,
so I did some laundry.

02:20.227 --> 02:22.316
Oh, no, you didn't just
do "some laundry."

02:22.359 --> 02:25.275
You fluffed, folded and ironed,
separated each piece of clothing

02:25.319 --> 02:26.798
with a tissue,
including my underwear.

02:26.842 --> 02:28.800
Yeah, thought that
was a nice touch.

02:28.844 --> 02:30.280
No, it's a creepy touch,
Sebastian.

02:30.324 --> 02:32.674
Breakfast anyone?
Mama's grillades.

02:32.717 --> 02:34.893
I'm down, as long as someone
doesn't think it's creepy.

02:34.937 --> 02:36.025
GREGORIO: Don't.

02:36.068 --> 02:38.984
Oh, man. Hang on.

02:39.028 --> 02:40.203
Hello.

02:40.247 --> 02:41.378
Tell me I'm not wrong here.

02:41.422 --> 02:43.685
Number one rule:
When living with a lady,

02:43.728 --> 02:47.558
unless specifically asked,
never, ever touch the lingerie.

02:47.602 --> 02:49.212
PRIDE:
That was Christopher.

02:49.256 --> 02:51.693
We just caught a shooting
at a research lab.

02:51.736 --> 02:53.042
Really?

02:53.085 --> 02:55.871
Really. Multiple victims.
Let's go.

02:57.525 --> 02:58.526
More for P.

03:01.268 --> 03:02.269
Thank you, Mr. Grabby.

03:08.100 --> 03:10.015
Two male victims
in the first lab.

03:10.059 --> 03:11.539
Three victims in here.

03:11.582 --> 03:13.367
Ordinary night shift
gone haywire?

03:13.410 --> 03:15.107
Loretta.

03:15.151 --> 03:16.892
Rough way to start the morning.

03:16.935 --> 03:20.504
With five victims, yes.
My final prelim is

03:20.548 --> 03:22.463
microbiology tech
Steven Bennecker.

03:22.506 --> 03:24.639
Random mass shooting?Don't think so.

03:24.682 --> 03:26.597
Each victim was killed
with a double tap.

03:26.641 --> 03:28.164
Suggests a trained shooter.

03:28.208 --> 03:29.513
Lab is privately owned.

03:29.557 --> 03:31.472
Civilians are our victims.
Why are we here?

03:31.515 --> 03:34.736
'Cause it's a good chance
our suspect is Navy.Why's that, Christopher?

03:34.779 --> 03:36.999
Well, security system
is state of the art.

03:37.042 --> 03:38.653
Biometric fingerprint scanner.

03:38.696 --> 03:40.132
And according
to the system,

03:40.176 --> 03:41.873
there were six people
here last night.

03:41.917 --> 03:43.788
Well, who's missing?

03:43.832 --> 03:47.662
Navy microbiologist
Lieutenant Ella Ford.

03:47.705 --> 03:49.272
GREGORIO:
Well, if she survived

03:49.316 --> 03:51.056
and was here, she would've
gone to the cops.

03:51.100 --> 03:52.667
Yeah, but there's
no sign of her.

03:52.710 --> 03:55.147
Phone's off-line.
No record of where she's living.

03:55.191 --> 03:56.671
It's like she disappeared.

03:56.714 --> 03:58.542
She's more than
a biologist.

03:59.587 --> 04:01.415
Combat trained.

04:01.458 --> 04:04.113
Two tours in war zones.

04:04.156 --> 04:05.419
What, she just snapped?

04:05.462 --> 04:06.724
Well, workplace
shootings

04:06.768 --> 04:08.291
are usually
male-perpetrated.

04:08.335 --> 04:11.425
Unless this was
about something else.

04:16.386 --> 04:17.779
High-tech,
secure vaults,

04:17.822 --> 04:19.215
climate-controlled,

04:19.259 --> 04:20.521
multiple fail-safes.

04:20.564 --> 04:21.565
Whatever they were
keeping in there,

04:21.609 --> 04:22.871
they were carefully curating it.

04:22.914 --> 04:24.133
Until somebody pried
this door open

04:24.176 --> 04:25.613
and took it.

04:25.656 --> 04:26.962
Well, this place is

04:27.005 --> 04:28.572
a commercial
pharmaceutical lab.

04:28.616 --> 04:31.140
Supposedly working on
vitamin supplements.

04:31.183 --> 04:32.794
What could they be storing here?

04:32.837 --> 04:34.535
Something worth killing for.

04:34.578 --> 04:36.276
Christopher, you and Sebastian,

04:36.319 --> 04:39.279
turn the lab upside down,
find out what's missing.

04:39.322 --> 04:40.628
You got it.

04:40.671 --> 04:43.631
Gregorio, you and I need
to find Lieutenant Ford.

04:43.674 --> 04:44.675
Got it.

04:49.201 --> 04:53.728
Man. Finding Lieutenant
Ford is easier said than done.

04:53.771 --> 04:56.296
Why?
That girl somehow got out
that lab and ghosted.

04:56.339 --> 04:57.732
She's got to be
somewhere, P.

04:57.775 --> 04:59.473
No, I got eyes
all over the town.

04:59.516 --> 05:02.345
Transportation hubs,
airports. No sign.

05:02.389 --> 05:04.042
Well, according to what
I've seen of her record,

05:04.086 --> 05:05.174
she's got counter-intel
training.

05:05.217 --> 05:06.567
That's strange for a lab rat.

05:06.610 --> 05:08.482
Oh, you can't be serious.

05:08.525 --> 05:10.092
Oh, baby, I'm serious
as a heart attack.

05:10.135 --> 05:11.833
No, it's not you.
My new roommate thought

05:11.876 --> 05:15.010
it was the perfect time to send
me an interactive chore app.

05:15.053 --> 05:18.405
Sebastian love his
apps, and he love his chores.

05:18.448 --> 05:19.884
Yeah, well, he should
be more focused

05:19.928 --> 05:21.538
on the five murders
we're trying to solve.

05:21.582 --> 05:24.236
Oh, Sebastian's multitasking.

05:24.280 --> 05:26.195
He just sent me a list
of the projects

05:26.238 --> 05:27.936
that Linnaeous Labs
was working on.

05:27.979 --> 05:31.243
Various unpronounceable
pharmaceutical patents.

05:31.287 --> 05:33.202
Can't imagine they'd
rate mass killing.

05:33.245 --> 05:36.248
These patents go like hotcakes
on the black market.

05:36.292 --> 05:38.860
I'm thinking
corporate espionage.

05:38.903 --> 05:40.905
Still doesn't explain
why a Navy biologist

05:40.949 --> 05:42.516
was working at a commercial lab.

05:42.559 --> 05:45.780
According to Lieutenant Ford's
C.O., she wasn't.

05:45.823 --> 05:50.219
Currently stationed at a
research facility in... Siberia.

05:50.262 --> 05:52.700
Has been for seven months.GREGORIO:
How is that possible?

05:52.743 --> 05:55.093
Lieutenant Ford's prints
were all over that lab.

05:55.137 --> 05:57.748
Exactly.Sounds like you got a paradox.

05:57.792 --> 05:59.054
Hey.

05:59.097 --> 06:01.099
Hannah, you're back.

06:01.143 --> 06:02.449
Yeah, sorry I'm late,

06:02.492 --> 06:04.581
but I just spoke
to Linnaeous Labs.

06:04.625 --> 06:06.409
They confirmed Lieutenant Ford
as an employee,

06:06.453 --> 06:07.715
but wouldn't confirm
what she was doing there.

06:07.758 --> 06:10.500
No, I mean,
you're back early.

06:10.544 --> 06:13.547
Well, five victims-- seemed like
you needed all hands on deck.

06:15.505 --> 06:17.942
You okay?
Yeah. Why?

06:17.986 --> 06:19.727
You were supposed to be
on a two-week

06:19.770 --> 06:21.032
personal leave for your family.

06:21.076 --> 06:22.512
Yeah, turns out
I only needed one.

06:22.556 --> 06:24.949
Family's good.
Should we talk about the case?

06:24.993 --> 06:27.343
Yeah, we should.
Yeah, team's yours.Yeah.

06:27.387 --> 06:30.172
Actually, I would love it
if you'd stick around, Dwayne.

06:30.215 --> 06:32.130
Got a tight-lipped lab,

06:32.174 --> 06:34.959
Navy biologist
on dubious assignment.

06:35.003 --> 06:36.657
SAC privileges could
really come in handy.

06:36.700 --> 06:39.007
Okay. Of course. Oh.

06:40.574 --> 06:41.792
This is Loretta.

06:41.836 --> 06:43.968
She's done with
the autopsies.

06:44.012 --> 06:45.100
I'll go see her?

06:45.143 --> 06:46.710
Great. Yeah.
I'll dig deeper

06:46.754 --> 06:48.799
on Lieutenant Ford.Okay.

06:52.977 --> 06:55.632
You buying that whole
"family good" line?

06:55.676 --> 06:57.852
Not in the least.

07:00.811 --> 07:02.291
Can I help you?

07:02.334 --> 07:05.773
I'm not the one in need.
Doctor... Wade?

07:05.816 --> 07:07.296
Yes. And you are?

07:07.339 --> 07:11.735
Inspector Nero.
Louisiana Department of Health.

07:11.779 --> 07:15.304
Oh. Went through assessment
last month.

07:15.347 --> 07:17.088
Frank Connish was the inspector.

07:17.132 --> 07:19.264
Yes, he was.
That's why I'm here.

07:19.308 --> 07:23.007
Frank found some abnormalities,

07:23.051 --> 07:24.313
which required
further review.

07:24.356 --> 07:25.619
He didn't alert me.

07:25.662 --> 07:26.968
Consider this your alert.

07:27.011 --> 07:28.360
I've been here five minutes.

07:28.404 --> 07:29.797
I've seen five different
code violations,

07:29.840 --> 07:30.972
including overcrowding.

07:31.015 --> 07:34.758
I'm filing form F-95B

07:34.802 --> 07:37.500
in compliance
with emergency protocol.

07:37.544 --> 07:40.503
Key word "filing."
Present tense,

07:40.547 --> 07:43.114
as in, you haven't been
authorized.

07:43.158 --> 07:45.508
No. Key word "emergency."

07:45.552 --> 07:48.729
Mm-hmm. Autopsy reports, please.

07:50.731 --> 07:52.602
Public Health has the prelim.

07:52.646 --> 07:55.387
Whatever you think you've found,
it's a mistake.

07:55.431 --> 07:57.520
I don't make those.

07:57.564 --> 07:59.000
Unlike you.

07:59.043 --> 08:03.134
Physical evaluation vague.

08:03.178 --> 08:06.703
Handwriting is sloppy.

08:06.747 --> 08:09.140
In my 25 years, I've never...

08:09.184 --> 08:10.794
Met a health inspector like me.

08:10.838 --> 08:12.970
It's not the first time
I've heard that.

08:13.014 --> 08:15.451
This lab is subpar at best.

08:15.495 --> 08:19.063
Here is a notice
of failure

08:19.107 --> 08:20.674
to comply to code.

08:20.717 --> 08:25.635
Please address these issues
before re-inspection.

08:25.679 --> 08:27.724
Have a nice day.

08:28.856 --> 08:31.336
Excuse me.

08:35.950 --> 08:38.300
Everything all right, Loretta?No, Dwayne.

08:38.343 --> 08:41.433
According to the
Health Department, at best,

08:41.477 --> 08:43.740
it's subpar.

08:43.784 --> 08:47.352
You are the finest medical
examiner in the Southeast.

08:47.396 --> 08:49.354
With the sloppiest penmanship.

08:49.398 --> 08:51.966
Anyway...
the victims,

08:52.009 --> 08:55.317
I pulled nine-millimeter slugs
from each one of them.

08:55.360 --> 08:57.667
Ballistics is running
a search for the weapon.

08:57.711 --> 08:59.408
Find anything else?
Yes.

08:59.451 --> 09:02.629
Traces of a chemical coating
on all the bullets.

09:02.672 --> 09:04.326
You get an analysis?
Mm-hmm.

09:04.369 --> 09:07.155
It's a mixture of airborne
contaminants and toxins.

09:07.198 --> 09:10.506
Elements of chromium,
lead, ferric oxide.

09:10.550 --> 09:12.856
Probably came from wherever
the suspect loaded the weapon.

09:12.900 --> 09:14.075
Some kind of hideout?

09:14.118 --> 09:15.859
Yeah.

09:15.903 --> 09:18.862
All the chemicals
seem to be present

09:18.906 --> 09:20.908
in ship manufacturing.

09:20.951 --> 09:23.432
Ferric oxide
suggests rust.

09:23.475 --> 09:26.740
There's an old shipyard about
two miles from Linnaeous Labs.

09:26.783 --> 09:27.915
It's worth checking it out.

09:27.958 --> 09:30.700
Yeah, okay.

09:30.744 --> 09:32.354
Listen, Loretta,

09:32.397 --> 09:34.617
whatever that
inspector

09:34.661 --> 09:37.272
said to you, forget about it.

09:37.315 --> 09:39.230
You're the best.

09:46.498 --> 09:48.631
Entrances are located
on the east, west

09:48.675 --> 09:50.372
and north side
of the shipyard.

09:50.415 --> 09:52.417
Split up,
work our way backwards?

09:52.461 --> 09:54.637
Yeah. I'll take the north.Let's go.

10:24.275 --> 10:25.537
East storage.

10:26.626 --> 10:27.931
Looks like...

10:30.107 --> 10:31.326
Suspect's fleeing west!

10:32.980 --> 10:34.198
I lost visual.

10:35.809 --> 10:38.202
I got nothing. Pride?

10:40.509 --> 10:41.989
NCIS!

10:42.032 --> 10:44.426
Hands where I can see them.

10:44.469 --> 10:45.949
Drop the container.

10:48.822 --> 10:51.520
If I do that, we all die.

11:05.534 --> 11:06.883
HANNAH:
What's going on?

11:06.927 --> 11:08.798
GREGORIO:
Hands up!

11:10.104 --> 11:11.583
NERO:
Like I told Special Agent Pride,

11:11.627 --> 11:13.934
I strongly recommend
against that suggestion.

11:13.977 --> 11:15.587
But you didn't explain why.

11:15.631 --> 11:17.546
You know him, Dwayne?

11:17.589 --> 11:18.765
Not really.

11:18.808 --> 11:20.854
Met him at Loretta's morgue.

11:20.897 --> 11:23.857
Health inspector.
But I got a feeling he's not.

11:23.900 --> 11:26.381
Apologies for the duplicity,
but it was warranted.

11:26.424 --> 11:29.253
Who are you?Commander Rufus Nero,
Naval Intelligence.

11:29.297 --> 11:32.387
Yeah, right.Naval Intelligence
shares leads with NCIS.

11:32.430 --> 11:34.563
Ordinarily, yes,
Special Agent Khoury.

11:34.606 --> 11:37.609
Current circumstances
demand discretion.

11:37.653 --> 11:38.959
Who talks like that?

11:39.002 --> 11:40.308
I do, Gregorio.

11:40.351 --> 11:41.657
Now...

11:41.701 --> 11:43.746
you all need to let me deal

11:43.790 --> 11:45.052
with a very delicate
situation.

11:45.095 --> 11:46.662
Five people are dead,

11:46.706 --> 11:49.099
and Navy biologist Ella Ford
is probably responsible.

11:49.143 --> 11:52.407
Lieutenant Ford
was working for me.

11:52.450 --> 11:54.757
You need to start
explaining yourself.

11:54.801 --> 11:59.370
You need to put the container
down and show us some I.D.

11:59.414 --> 12:00.371
Do it!

12:00.415 --> 12:01.808
Please don't shoot.

12:01.851 --> 12:03.548
You might hit what's
in this container,

12:03.592 --> 12:04.941
and none of us want that.

12:04.985 --> 12:06.856
What's in there?

12:06.900 --> 12:09.163
Does Virus-X
mean anything to you?

12:10.773 --> 12:13.123
Largely unknown disease
discovered

12:13.167 --> 12:15.778
in the melting Arctic caps.
It's so powerful,

12:15.822 --> 12:18.259
it could be the world's
next pandemic.NERO: That's right.

12:18.302 --> 12:20.000
What I'm holding here
is nothing short of

12:20.043 --> 12:21.479
a biological nuclear weapon.

12:21.523 --> 12:23.220
What do you got, Ebola in a box?

12:23.264 --> 12:27.050
What's in here makes Ebola
look like the hiccups.

12:28.835 --> 12:32.360
Okay, I'll let you all see
for yourselves, all right?

12:32.403 --> 12:33.970
Okay.

12:38.714 --> 12:39.846
Put it down.

12:39.889 --> 12:41.891
Slowly.

12:57.994 --> 12:59.735
It's gone.

13:03.521 --> 13:06.176
Well, I guess we know
what Lieutenant Ford was after.

13:10.050 --> 13:11.399
PARKER:
Somebody help me understand

13:11.442 --> 13:12.835
how a virus
as dangerous as this

13:12.879 --> 13:14.532
can be stolen from a supposedly

13:14.576 --> 13:16.578
highly secure
and clandestine laboratory.

13:16.621 --> 13:18.710
Which is why we have to...GRASSLEY: If you recall,

13:18.754 --> 13:21.496
CDC wanted to handle Virus-X
in its own facility.

13:21.539 --> 13:23.193
Where word would have spread
so fast...

13:23.237 --> 13:24.586
The same damn thing would
have happened, Commander.

13:24.629 --> 13:26.849
Look, let's just
take a beat here, all right?

13:26.893 --> 13:28.068
Look, none of this
would have happened

13:28.111 --> 13:29.852
had I been given
operational control.

13:29.896 --> 13:31.854
You do appreciate the irony
of that statement, right?

13:31.898 --> 13:33.725
Considering the fact it was your
operative who was compromised.

13:33.769 --> 13:36.163
All we can confirm is
that Lieutenant Ford

13:36.206 --> 13:38.034
recovered the
virus in Siberia

13:38.078 --> 13:40.036
and studied it in the lab
as a preventative measure.

13:40.080 --> 13:41.864
Sh-She's the only
one who may be

13:41.908 --> 13:43.561
actually working
her mission here.

13:43.605 --> 13:45.912
GRASSLEY: Well, if her mission
was to steal the virus

13:45.955 --> 13:47.391
and do God-knows-what with it.

13:47.435 --> 13:49.350
Look, lot at stake, yes.

13:49.393 --> 13:52.744
Which is why we need to focus
on finding Lieutenant Ford.

13:52.788 --> 13:55.138
See? At least NCIS gets it.

13:55.182 --> 13:56.705
Let me tell you
what I get, Nero.

13:56.748 --> 13:58.881
Virus-X has the capacity
to decimate a third

13:58.925 --> 14:00.274
of the world's population.

14:00.317 --> 14:02.276
Worse than smallpox
and yellow fever wrapped up

14:02.319 --> 14:03.712
in a bubonic plague sandwich.

14:04.931 --> 14:06.671
And Navy Intel is being smug.

14:06.715 --> 14:08.760
Sticks and stones, Samantha.

14:10.632 --> 14:11.894
What's the score?

14:11.938 --> 14:13.722
Eighth round,
no punches pulled.

14:13.765 --> 14:16.246
DHS ran Linnaeous Labs
as deep cover

14:16.290 --> 14:18.335
for cross-agency Operation-X,

14:18.379 --> 14:20.947
but now they're mad at CDC
for exposing the op,

14:20.990 --> 14:22.426
and everyone's mad
at Navy Intel

14:22.470 --> 14:24.124
for bringing in Lieutenant Ford
on the mission

14:24.167 --> 14:25.299
in the first place.

14:25.342 --> 14:26.866
Nothing but chaos.

14:26.909 --> 14:29.390
Plus, this virus gets out,
we're looking at a pandemic.

14:29.433 --> 14:30.695
How are Pride and
Hannah holding up?

14:30.739 --> 14:32.306
Way more patient
than I would be.

14:33.960 --> 14:36.484
Okay, everyone needs to
just calm down for a second.

14:36.527 --> 14:38.355
Take a breath.What's CDC doing

14:38.399 --> 14:40.705
in all this?
Other than pointing fingers.

14:40.749 --> 14:42.403
We provided a thorough risk
assessment that specifically

14:42.446 --> 14:44.927
warned of this exact situation.

14:44.971 --> 14:47.538
Oh. So basically your
argument is "I told you so"?

14:54.284 --> 14:56.286
Thank you.

14:56.330 --> 15:00.073
There will be plenty of time
to share the blame.

15:00.116 --> 15:03.119
After we catch up
to Lieutenant Ford.

15:03.163 --> 15:06.383
Secure the virus
before it gets out.

15:06.427 --> 15:10.039
But we're gonna need
some cooperation.

15:10.083 --> 15:12.302
Access to DHS's full
surveillance package,

15:12.346 --> 15:13.825
to begin with.

15:13.869 --> 15:16.480
And NCIS needs to be read in
on all the operations.

15:16.524 --> 15:18.308
We need to find Lieutenant Ford

15:18.352 --> 15:20.136
before she sets
the virus free

15:20.180 --> 15:22.095
or sells it

15:22.138 --> 15:24.967
or drops it on the ground
by mistake.

15:25.011 --> 15:27.578
Prevent the worst-case scenario.

15:27.622 --> 15:28.753
Now, we got a BOLO out,

15:28.797 --> 15:30.277
but we need
extra manpower.

15:30.320 --> 15:31.800
Full cooperation

15:31.843 --> 15:34.455
across all agencies,
agreed, all right?

15:34.498 --> 15:37.632
Ooh, ooh, apologies.You're leaving?

15:37.675 --> 15:39.808
Got to go deliver my own head
on a platter.

15:39.851 --> 15:41.984
My C.O. wants to debrief ASAP.

15:42.028 --> 15:43.986
Keep me in the loop?Of course.

15:44.030 --> 15:45.683
PRIDE: ...we might just be
able to contain the virus.

15:45.727 --> 15:46.902
Now, Grassley,
how many men

15:46.946 --> 15:47.990
do y'all have on the ground?

15:48.034 --> 15:49.078
We have 283 in town...

15:51.515 --> 15:53.604
How bad is it?

15:53.648 --> 15:54.997
"End of the world" bad

15:55.041 --> 15:56.651
if we don't find
Lieutenant Ford pronto.

15:56.694 --> 15:58.392
Really? Yeah, 'cause my
tonsils are starting

15:58.435 --> 15:59.654
to get swollen,
I think.

15:59.697 --> 16:01.003
You and Patton find anything
that could help?

16:01.047 --> 16:02.831
Well, we dumped
Lieutenant Ford's phone,

16:02.874 --> 16:04.528
which has been
off-line for 36 hours.

16:04.572 --> 16:07.140
Um, she was in touch
with an unlisted number

16:07.183 --> 16:09.664
in the days leading up to the
shooting, but no trace yet.

16:09.707 --> 16:10.882
Well, it could be an accomplice.

16:10.926 --> 16:12.232
Or a handler if she's a spy,

16:12.275 --> 16:13.885
or a buyer if she's trying
to make a buck.

16:13.929 --> 16:15.235
That's a lot of "or's"
in that sentence.

16:15.278 --> 16:16.671
Well, the only guy
that can clear it up

16:16.714 --> 16:18.194
just walked out the door.

16:18.238 --> 16:20.153
Think this guy Nero
has something to do with it?

16:20.196 --> 16:22.242
Well, he did trick Wade into
stealing forensic evidence.

16:22.285 --> 16:24.896
And he tried to walk out
with the Virus-X himself.

16:24.940 --> 16:26.507
And he just walked out
of his own meeting,

16:26.550 --> 16:28.335
just when we were discussing
finding Lieutenant Ford.

16:28.378 --> 16:30.206
Well, we should go follow him.No rush, Gregorio.

16:30.250 --> 16:32.034
I slipped a GPS tracker
in his pocket.

16:32.078 --> 16:33.905
Where'd you get the tracker?

16:33.949 --> 16:36.169
Oh, I got a lot of
interesting things in my bag.

16:36.212 --> 16:37.909
That's pretty badass.Mm-hmm.

16:37.953 --> 16:39.433
Looks like Nero's on the move.

16:39.476 --> 16:41.696
You think he's going after
Lieutenant Ford?

16:41.739 --> 16:43.524
Only one way to find out.
Sebastian, Gregorio,

16:43.567 --> 16:45.047
you're with me. Lasalle...

16:45.091 --> 16:46.962
I'll get with Patton,
run a deep background check

16:47.006 --> 16:48.398
on this Nero dude.

16:50.226 --> 16:52.054
Okay, you're gonna be
taking a right.

16:52.098 --> 16:53.186
When, Sebastian?

16:53.229 --> 16:55.405
Right about... now, now!
Do it now!

16:57.016 --> 16:59.453
You got to give me
advance warning.

16:59.496 --> 17:00.584
Maybe if you weren't speeding...

17:00.628 --> 17:02.891
I'm doing 40 in a 35 zone.

17:02.934 --> 17:05.198
That's technically speeding...You're the one with the GPS.

17:05.241 --> 17:07.069
Do you want to switch?You know what, why don't you

17:07.113 --> 17:08.505
check the chore app
to see if we can.

17:08.549 --> 17:10.072
Okay, you know what?
I-I knew you were gonna

17:10.116 --> 17:11.378
make a big deal
about the chore app.

17:11.421 --> 17:12.727
It's not...Yeah, because I'm a grown woman

17:12.770 --> 17:14.207
and I've been taking care
of myself

17:14.250 --> 17:15.773
without the benefit of an app
for the last 20 years.

17:15.817 --> 17:16.905
Yeah, that's debatable.

17:16.948 --> 17:17.819
HANNAH:
Hey, guys?

17:17.862 --> 17:20.387
You know I can hear you, right?

17:20.430 --> 17:21.823
Sorry. Yeah,

17:21.866 --> 17:23.694
just some, uh, roommate stuff.

17:23.738 --> 17:25.392
Yeah, okay, well,
can we get back to

17:25.435 --> 17:27.785
"tracking the suspect" stuff,
huh? Where's Nero?

17:27.829 --> 17:29.744
Uh, he pulled off the main road.

17:29.787 --> 17:32.094
Some sort of container depot.

17:32.138 --> 17:33.835
A half a mile behind us.

17:33.878 --> 17:36.446
Yeah. 'Cause again,
you weren't paying attention.

17:36.490 --> 17:38.187
You...Yeah, yeah, it's all right.

17:38.231 --> 17:41.103
I'm at the depot, entering now.

17:41.147 --> 17:43.627
I'll take position
at the west end of the yard.

17:43.671 --> 17:45.586
You guys back me up.

17:45.629 --> 17:47.805
SEBASTIAN:
Copy. We're right behind you.

17:58.773 --> 18:01.428
He's on the phone.

18:03.647 --> 18:05.084
And he's on the move.

18:05.127 --> 18:06.781
GREGORIO:
Could be making contact

18:06.824 --> 18:09.131
with Lieutenant Ford. We got your six.

18:26.714 --> 18:28.629
Nero's made contact
with Lieutenant Ford.

18:28.672 --> 18:30.152
We take them now.

18:30.196 --> 18:32.589
FORD:
I have to explain.

18:32.633 --> 18:33.938
I'm coming in from behind.

18:33.982 --> 18:35.157
We got you covered.

18:37.333 --> 18:39.248
NCIS! Don't move!

18:39.292 --> 18:40.989
What the hell?

18:44.210 --> 18:45.863
Ella, run! Run!

18:45.907 --> 18:47.561
I'll hold them off.
Get out of here.

18:49.215 --> 18:50.520
NCIS!

19:00.356 --> 19:02.184
Nero, put the gun down!

19:02.228 --> 19:03.794
They're getting away!Now!

19:13.239 --> 19:14.936
You happy?

19:18.374 --> 19:19.854
Lieutenant Ford!

19:19.897 --> 19:21.421
Don't shoot!

19:21.464 --> 19:23.336
I won't if you don't
give me a reason to.

19:23.379 --> 19:24.989
Tell me where
you took the virus.

19:27.601 --> 19:29.951
I didn't take the virus
anywhere.

19:32.649 --> 19:34.390
I am the virus.

19:47.229 --> 19:48.796
Loretta.

19:48.839 --> 19:51.277
What's so important you couldn't
explain it to me on the phone?

19:51.320 --> 19:54.018
We need to get Lieutenant Ford
contained now.

19:54.062 --> 19:55.629
What's wrong with her?

19:55.672 --> 19:58.501
She didn't steal the virus.
She injected herself with it.

19:58.545 --> 20:00.764
She injected herself?Where can we bring her?

20:00.808 --> 20:02.288
A hospital.

20:02.331 --> 20:04.942
We can't do that.I need to sit down.

20:04.986 --> 20:06.640
Okay, the lab, I guess.
But somebody needs

20:06.683 --> 20:08.555
to explain to me
why you brought her here.

20:08.598 --> 20:11.166
Hospital personnel get wind
of a Virus-X patient,

20:11.210 --> 20:12.602
there'll be mass panic.

20:12.646 --> 20:14.735
Not to mention,
somebody tried to abduct her.

20:14.778 --> 20:16.606
She's a target.Okay, go on.

20:16.650 --> 20:19.087
But the lab isn't even remotely
equipped for the care she needs.

20:19.130 --> 20:20.784
It'll do for now.

20:20.828 --> 20:23.570
We need a safe, secure and
quiet place to care for her

20:23.613 --> 20:25.615
until I can make
arrangements.

20:25.659 --> 20:27.269
What is the health inspector
doing here?

20:27.313 --> 20:28.749
He's no health inspector.

20:30.011 --> 20:32.666
Rufus Nero, Naval Intelligence.

20:32.709 --> 20:36.800
I'll get back to that tidbit
after I've called the CDC.

20:36.844 --> 20:39.977
Already called them. Please,
just check on Lieutenant Ford.

20:42.458 --> 20:43.764
I should go, too.

20:43.807 --> 20:45.940
Not till we get
something straight.

20:45.983 --> 20:48.029
You're upset because
I didn't tell you

20:48.072 --> 20:49.726
I was meeting
Lieutenant Ford.

20:49.770 --> 20:52.251
Which is the second time
you lied to us in one day.

20:52.294 --> 20:54.818
I was trying to
protect my colleague.By deceiving NCIS?

20:54.862 --> 20:58.474
Somebody got into Linnaeous Labs
and killed five people.

20:58.518 --> 21:00.389
Think we can agree
it was an inside job.

21:00.433 --> 21:03.087
I don't know who to trust.
You'd have done the same.

21:03.131 --> 21:04.654
Maybe.

21:04.698 --> 21:06.308
Which is why
I haven't arrested you.

21:06.352 --> 21:08.092
But the day's not over.

21:08.136 --> 21:10.007
Watch your step, Nero.

21:10.051 --> 21:12.183
Dwayne, get the respirators.

21:12.227 --> 21:13.707
On it.

21:14.882 --> 21:16.318
Your temperature's high.

21:16.362 --> 21:18.146
Pupils are dilated.

21:18.189 --> 21:19.843
Severe headaches?

21:19.887 --> 21:21.410
Uh, muscle pain,
stomach cramping?

21:21.454 --> 21:23.325
All of it.
Okay.

21:23.369 --> 21:25.022
Let's get her hydrated.

21:25.066 --> 21:28.199
Mr. Nero, or whoever you are,
you can be of use.

21:28.243 --> 21:30.027
There is an isolation tent

21:30.071 --> 21:31.333
in the utility storage.

21:31.377 --> 21:33.509
I'll find it.

21:35.468 --> 21:37.513
You're wondering
if I'm contagious.

21:37.557 --> 21:40.647
I've been told it's the
deadliest virus in the world.

21:40.690 --> 21:42.475
Once it's incubated.

21:42.518 --> 21:44.607
Based on my research,
it'll infect

21:44.651 --> 21:47.349
my respiratory tract first,
then go airborne.

21:47.393 --> 21:50.221
We've got about ten hours
until that happens.

21:50.265 --> 21:52.267
Well, it's better to be safe
than sorry.

21:52.311 --> 21:54.443
Lieutenant Ford,
I have to ask you,

21:54.487 --> 21:56.358
why did you inject yourself?

21:56.402 --> 21:59.622
I was in the vault last night
when I heard gunshots.

21:59.666 --> 22:01.798
Someone was coming
for the virus.

22:01.842 --> 22:03.713
Didn't have time
to destroy it safely.

22:03.757 --> 22:05.585
My mission was to contain it.

22:05.628 --> 22:07.891
Her bloodstream was the
one place the sample was safe.

22:07.935 --> 22:09.937
I slipped out through
hazmat disposal,

22:09.980 --> 22:12.548
waited until I could
make contact with you, sir.

22:12.592 --> 22:13.723
You did the right thing, Ella.

22:13.767 --> 22:16.247
In what world
is this the right thing?

22:16.291 --> 22:18.772
I weighed the risks,
knew what I had to do,

22:18.815 --> 22:20.469
just like Commander Nero
taught me.

22:20.513 --> 22:21.905
Well done.

22:21.949 --> 22:24.255
Well, she's a brave girl.

22:24.299 --> 22:26.083
She just needs to
learn to sit still.

22:26.127 --> 22:28.347
All right, this is Christopher.

22:28.390 --> 22:30.305
Says they might have a lead
on the suspects

22:30.349 --> 22:31.567
who tried to grab
Lieutenant Ford.

22:31.611 --> 22:32.829
Let's go.

22:32.873 --> 22:34.788
I'll stay and assist Dr. Wade.

22:34.831 --> 22:36.398
Loretta?

22:36.442 --> 22:38.444
I'm fine.
We'll make do.

22:43.144 --> 22:46.190
Patton was able to
pull traffic cam video

22:46.234 --> 22:47.931
of the SUV as it fled.

22:47.975 --> 22:50.412
I pulled a photo of this man
in the passenger seat.

22:50.456 --> 22:52.066
Ran facial recognition,

22:52.109 --> 22:55.025
and it came back
as Peter Lankmire.

22:55.069 --> 22:56.853
Dishonorably discharged
from the military.

22:56.897 --> 22:59.943
Spent five years in Angola
for extortion and assault.

22:59.987 --> 23:01.684
Good chance we can add
multiple murders

23:01.728 --> 23:03.033
and attempted kidnapping.

23:03.077 --> 23:04.470
He looks good
for the lab shooting,

23:04.513 --> 23:05.775
but trying to steal a virus

23:05.819 --> 23:07.211
from a secret
government facility?

23:07.255 --> 23:08.865
No, this guy's muscle,
not strategy.

23:08.909 --> 23:10.519
Someone told him where
to find Linnaeous Labs,

23:10.563 --> 23:12.695
what to take, and where to find
Lieutenant Ford today.

23:12.739 --> 23:16.003
We need to locate Lankmire and
whoever's pulling the strings.

23:22.444 --> 23:23.750
WADE:
There's no change
in temperature.

23:23.793 --> 23:25.926
I'm not sure whether
that's good news or bad.

23:25.969 --> 23:29.190
I would like you
to reconsider antibiotics.

23:29.233 --> 23:31.105
There's no point.
It's useless.

23:31.148 --> 23:32.498
Acetaminophen, then?

23:32.541 --> 23:34.717
It could help with
the myalgia at least.

23:34.761 --> 23:37.894
That'll only mask some of the
symptoms for a little while.

23:37.938 --> 23:39.722
But that would give us
the opportunity

23:39.766 --> 23:41.724
to figure out how
to treat you properly.

23:41.768 --> 23:44.466
You're very kind, but no matter
what you do, Doctor,

23:44.510 --> 23:47.469
the pulmonary inflammation
is spreading.

23:49.732 --> 23:54.476
There are experiments
with antivirals that could help.

23:54.520 --> 23:56.043
We've studied all the trials.

23:56.086 --> 23:59.133
They only make the
virus more resistant.

24:01.918 --> 24:05.531
I'll die, and if you
don't contain me,

24:05.574 --> 24:08.142
the virus will live to spread.

24:08.185 --> 24:10.840
Don't be so eager
to accept a death sentence.

24:10.884 --> 24:14.017
I'm not eager. I'm resolved.

24:14.061 --> 24:17.194
It was my choice not to
let them weaponize it,

24:17.238 --> 24:20.067
even at the risk of my own life.

24:24.767 --> 24:26.769
Rest it is.

24:27.857 --> 24:29.772
Doctor's orders.

24:37.911 --> 24:39.042
How is she?

24:39.086 --> 24:41.567
Stubborn.
She's refusing treatment

24:41.610 --> 24:43.525
for fear the virus
grows stronger.

24:43.569 --> 24:45.266
She wants to honor her mission.

24:45.309 --> 24:46.876
Assuming that's your influence.

24:46.920 --> 24:49.183
Mission first.

24:49.226 --> 24:51.707
Look, if-if it could
have been me, I...But it wasn't.

24:51.751 --> 24:55.319
X-rays and lab results
suggest seven hours

24:55.363 --> 24:57.017
until the virus goes airborne.

24:57.060 --> 24:58.714
Less without proper care.

24:58.758 --> 25:01.412
We need to rush a medevac.

25:01.456 --> 25:02.675
GRASSLEY:
That won't be necessary.

25:02.718 --> 25:04.590
And you are?Jeff Grassley.

25:04.633 --> 25:05.808
CDC, but how...

25:05.852 --> 25:07.680
Dr. Wade, I cannot
thank you enough

25:07.723 --> 25:09.116
for the marvelous work
you've done.

25:09.159 --> 25:11.379
But we'll, uh...
we'll take it from here.

25:11.422 --> 25:13.120
They've cleared Ella for evac?

25:13.163 --> 25:15.557
D.C. wants her in Atlanta
so they can isolate the virus,

25:15.601 --> 25:17.559
and then they'll get
the top people working on her.

25:17.603 --> 25:18.560
Oh, well, that's a relief.

25:18.604 --> 25:20.562
But is it safe to move her?

25:20.606 --> 25:21.868
Safer than treating her here.

25:21.911 --> 25:23.260
Maybe you can
show us the way,

25:23.304 --> 25:24.653
Dr. Wade?

25:24.697 --> 25:25.785
Yeah.

25:31.355 --> 25:33.575
Just spoke to Gregorio
and Sebastian.

25:33.619 --> 25:35.708
They're interviewing everybody
with clearance to Virus-X.

25:35.751 --> 25:37.231
No suspects yet.

25:37.274 --> 25:40.234
And I'm poring over these
personnel files. Nothing.

25:40.277 --> 25:42.584
That's what I said--
reading files take too long.

25:42.628 --> 25:44.891
Which is why I connect the dots
using my own

25:44.934 --> 25:46.240
binary overlap intervals.

25:46.283 --> 25:47.807
Go on, but in English.

25:47.850 --> 25:50.592
I ran a full digital
background check

25:50.636 --> 25:52.289
on everybody who had
clearance to Virus-X,

25:52.333 --> 25:54.596
including whoever they dated
in high school.
And?

25:54.640 --> 25:57.599
I cross-referenced
with Lankmire's history.

25:57.643 --> 25:58.948
And?

25:58.992 --> 26:01.255
And, obviously,
I must have got a hit,

26:01.298 --> 26:03.213
or I wouldn't be here.

26:03.257 --> 26:06.608
Before he went to prison,
Lankmire did security for CDC.

26:06.652 --> 26:08.610
LASALLE: He worked a relief
project here in New Orleans.

26:08.654 --> 26:10.307
CDC built three
emergency shelters,

26:10.351 --> 26:11.700
and one guy ran point.

26:11.744 --> 26:13.876
HANNAH:
Jeff Grassley,

26:13.920 --> 26:15.791
who's now supervising
the Virus-X project.

26:15.835 --> 26:17.793
Looks like we got ourselves
a mole.

26:17.837 --> 26:19.578
I'll tell Pride.

26:22.015 --> 26:23.625
I don't like this.

26:23.669 --> 26:26.236
I know you're concerned
about Ella's well-being,

26:26.280 --> 26:28.978
but this transport is...NERO: A vulnerability.

26:29.022 --> 26:31.894
What's to say the evac won't be
compromised, like the lab was?

26:31.938 --> 26:33.417
With a security detail?

26:33.461 --> 26:35.594
That's a risk
worth taking.

26:35.637 --> 26:37.726
This is Ella's life at stake.

26:37.770 --> 26:40.076
Look, I know that
I haven't given you

26:40.120 --> 26:43.645
much reason to trust me,
but something is off here.

26:44.690 --> 26:46.343
Will you back my play?

26:47.344 --> 26:48.650
Will I what, now?

26:48.694 --> 26:50.870
All right,
Lieutenant Ford's secure.

26:50.913 --> 26:53.176
We are on the move.

26:53.220 --> 26:56.353
I am afraid that
I cannot let you leave.

26:56.397 --> 26:58.181
Quit fooling around, Nero.

26:58.225 --> 27:00.009
We're medevacing her
to the CDC.

27:00.053 --> 27:01.663
Nope, sorry, she stays here.

27:01.707 --> 27:03.534
Dr. Wade, can you explain to him

27:03.578 --> 27:05.536
that we're trying to save
Lieutenant Ford's life?

27:05.580 --> 27:06.886
Uh, Nero...

27:06.929 --> 27:08.844
We can't risk her
being compromised again.

27:08.888 --> 27:10.193
Not with this virus.

27:10.237 --> 27:12.282
Enough.
My orders are from D.C.

27:12.326 --> 27:13.893
This is not a debate.

27:13.936 --> 27:15.372
Let's go.

27:15.416 --> 27:17.810
All right, then, fine.
I-I'm coming with you.

27:19.420 --> 27:21.944
There is no room for you, Nero.

27:21.988 --> 27:23.250
And, honestly, with everything
we've been through,

27:23.293 --> 27:24.773
I don't think I trust you.

27:24.817 --> 27:26.383
Yeah, well, I don't think
I trust you, either.

27:26.427 --> 27:28.734
Gentlemen, let's take a breath.

27:28.777 --> 27:30.953
All right. You're right.
You're right, Dr. Wade.

27:30.997 --> 27:32.476
There's no need to argue.

27:33.739 --> 27:35.349
Peter, do it now.

27:57.284 --> 27:59.112
He's coming this way.
Do you have a weapon?

27:59.155 --> 28:00.722
I'm a medical examiner.

28:00.766 --> 28:01.941
So? I'm a scientist.

28:01.984 --> 28:03.377
So where's your weapon?

28:08.774 --> 28:11.124
Okay, I'll draw his fire.

28:11.167 --> 28:13.039
What? And get shot in
the process? No, thanks.

28:16.825 --> 28:18.131
Stay down.

28:27.793 --> 28:29.229
WADE:
Let's get out of here.

28:34.451 --> 28:36.497
Loretta?

28:36.540 --> 28:37.759
I'm okay.

28:37.803 --> 28:39.369
Lieutenant Ford?Gone.

28:39.413 --> 28:40.631
Grassley's got her.

28:42.024 --> 28:43.939
What could he want from her?The virus.

28:43.983 --> 28:45.288
He's behind
the whole plot.

28:45.332 --> 28:46.594
We just got to figure out why.

28:46.637 --> 28:48.683
And where he's taking
Lieutenant Ford.

28:50.685 --> 28:52.948
Dwayne says Wade's rattled
but safe and sound. Nero, too.

28:52.992 --> 28:54.123
That's gonna change soon

28:54.167 --> 28:55.646
if we don't catch up
to Grassley.

28:55.690 --> 28:56.909
Yeah, like 180 minutes soon.

28:56.952 --> 28:58.606
I was looking at
Wade's lab tests.

28:58.649 --> 29:00.651
The virus is gonna be airborne
in, like, three hours.

29:00.695 --> 29:02.305
Well, DHS and FBI
are covering the city.

29:02.349 --> 29:03.611
Patton's doing his magic.

29:03.654 --> 29:05.091
We need to get into
Grassley's head.

29:05.134 --> 29:07.136
If we can anticipate
his plan, we can end it.

29:07.180 --> 29:09.965
So, is he a terrorist
or an opportunist?

29:10.009 --> 29:13.490
Well, targeted terrorist attacks
are usually chosen by ideology.

29:13.534 --> 29:15.014
All right, figure out
what Grassley believes,

29:15.057 --> 29:16.798
that could give us a clue
to where

29:16.842 --> 29:18.104
he's going to unleash the virus.

29:18.147 --> 29:19.366
If he's acting on ideology.

29:19.409 --> 29:20.628
He could be looking
for a payday.

29:20.671 --> 29:22.151
Which means
we should look

29:22.195 --> 29:24.110
into financial
weaknesses, debts,

29:24.153 --> 29:25.198
bad investments.

29:25.241 --> 29:26.852
Ask, and you shall receive.

29:26.895 --> 29:28.854
I just did a deep dive
on this joker,

29:28.897 --> 29:32.031
and it seems that his heart
is serving the wrong master.

29:32.074 --> 29:33.815
2010, he jacked up
the pharmaceutical prices

29:33.859 --> 29:35.164
at his privately held company.

29:35.208 --> 29:36.862
A year later,
he files for bankruptcy,

29:36.905 --> 29:39.168
losing a couple
other companies

29:39.212 --> 29:41.170
before ending up at CDC,
making a fraction

29:41.214 --> 29:43.477
of what he used to.He wants to get rich.

29:43.520 --> 29:45.174
That means selling the virus
to the highest bidder.

29:45.218 --> 29:47.873
And there's a number of bad
agents who'll pay a mint for it.

29:47.916 --> 29:49.831
Dwayne.

29:49.875 --> 29:51.746
Yeah, Hannah?

29:53.052 --> 29:55.010
Yeah, hold on.

29:55.054 --> 29:59.710
Dr. Wade. Dr. Wade.

29:59.754 --> 30:00.842
Let's take care of you

30:00.886 --> 30:03.062
before you take care
of your lab.

30:03.105 --> 30:04.367
I don't need...Look.

30:04.411 --> 30:06.892
You're bleeding. Huh?

30:06.935 --> 30:08.589
Come on, you're a doctor.

30:08.632 --> 30:10.896
You know the risks
of infection.

30:12.201 --> 30:14.856
In you go.

30:14.900 --> 30:15.901
Have a seat.

30:15.944 --> 30:17.380
First aid kit?

30:17.424 --> 30:19.948
Upper drawer.

30:28.565 --> 30:31.786
I owe you an apology.

30:31.830 --> 30:33.527
Oh, for applying too much
pressure to my wound

30:33.570 --> 30:35.746
or getting my lab shot up

30:35.790 --> 30:38.097
or calling my morgue subpar?

30:39.228 --> 30:41.752
Touché.

30:41.796 --> 30:44.712
For the record, Dr. Wade,
I have never seen

30:44.755 --> 30:46.932
a morgue this well-cared-for.

30:46.975 --> 30:49.282
And I have never met an M.E.

30:49.325 --> 30:50.849
who takes better care
of the living.

30:50.892 --> 30:52.633
Is that another one
of your deceptions?

30:52.676 --> 30:55.288
Hand to God.
You are one of a kind.

30:56.550 --> 30:58.117
Oh.

30:58.160 --> 30:59.988
Well, you are, too.

31:00.032 --> 31:03.252
In a good way or bad?The jury's still out.

31:03.296 --> 31:05.515
PRIDE:
Team seems to think

31:05.559 --> 31:07.778
that Grassley is out
to sell the virus.

31:07.822 --> 31:09.476
Sell it?Well, there are plenty of

31:09.519 --> 31:11.260
bad actors out there
who would want to weaponize it.

31:11.304 --> 31:13.915
The virus is in Lieutenant
Ford at the moment.

31:13.959 --> 31:16.265
How would Grassley extract
it from her bloodstream?

31:16.309 --> 31:18.920
He'd need to keep her in
a contained environment.

31:18.964 --> 31:20.879
NERO: He'd want the strain
at its maximum bacterial load.

31:20.922 --> 31:24.273
The more advanced the virus,
the more powerful the sample.

31:24.317 --> 31:27.494
The shape Lieutenant Ford is in,
he can't have moved her far.

31:27.537 --> 31:29.191
Well, he needs a sterile
medical facility,

31:29.235 --> 31:30.889
away from prying eyes.

31:30.932 --> 31:32.499
He'd need more than that.
He'd need a clinical

31:32.542 --> 31:35.545
microbiology lab to make sure
that he kept the virus pure.

31:35.589 --> 31:38.548
Any location in New Orleans
is strictly regulated.

31:38.592 --> 31:41.464
It's too public.Unless...

31:41.508 --> 31:45.251
Medical supplies, machinery,
microbiology lab.

31:45.294 --> 31:48.254
Would a dormant CDC shelter
hold all of that?

31:48.297 --> 31:50.125
Yeah, that would do.

31:50.169 --> 31:51.474
Grassley oversaw construction

31:51.518 --> 31:53.215
of three of them
around the Gulf.

31:53.259 --> 31:56.088
Might have a lead
on where he's at.

31:58.351 --> 32:00.048
Lasalle said no sign of
Grassley or the lieutenant

32:00.092 --> 32:01.658
at the Gulfport shelter.

32:01.702 --> 32:03.486
Yeah, and we're reaching
the 11th hour here, too.

32:03.530 --> 32:05.271
Virus could be strong
and airborne by now.

32:05.314 --> 32:06.446
Well, then, you better
hold your breath.

32:06.489 --> 32:07.490
Gregorio?What?!

32:07.534 --> 32:09.623
What now? What'd I do?

32:09.666 --> 32:11.625
If we go in there
a-and something goes wrong

32:11.668 --> 32:14.497
and we contract
a deadly virus,

32:14.541 --> 32:16.325
I just...

32:16.369 --> 32:18.327
I want you to know
that I appreciate you.

32:18.371 --> 32:20.851
Same here, baby.

32:20.895 --> 32:23.332
Let's go.

32:32.037 --> 32:34.039
I'll zig.I'll zag.

32:55.495 --> 32:56.844
I wouldn't.

33:00.239 --> 33:02.415
Thanks.

33:05.418 --> 33:09.204
All right. You're gonna tell us
where Lieutenant Ford is.

33:09.248 --> 33:11.206
He doesn't have to.
I already found her.

33:11.250 --> 33:12.947
We're too late.

33:32.097 --> 33:35.013
Lieutenant Ford is dead.
We have to assume

33:35.056 --> 33:36.840
that Grassley's in possession
of the virus now

33:36.884 --> 33:38.494
and that he's
willing to sell it.

33:38.538 --> 33:41.062
Well, FBI, NOPD and JPSO

33:41.106 --> 33:43.673
and the state troopers
have the city on lockdown.

33:43.717 --> 33:46.285
There's no way he's getting
out of here by air or land.

33:46.328 --> 33:48.504
Yeah, but that still leaves
waterways, passenger cars.

33:48.548 --> 33:50.289
It's way too many exit points.

33:50.332 --> 33:52.291
Plus, Sebastian and Gregorio
can't get the muscle to talk.

33:52.334 --> 33:57.470
Lieutenant Ford gave up her life
to protect that virus.

33:57.513 --> 33:59.515
We're not gonna
let her die in vain.

33:59.559 --> 34:01.474
We'll check every
car, boat, bicycle

34:01.517 --> 34:03.302
and pedestrian heading
out of New Orleans

34:03.345 --> 34:04.607
until we find him.

34:04.651 --> 34:06.740
Or you can hitch a
ride on a riverboat.

34:06.783 --> 34:09.786
You theorizing with us,
P, or you got a lead?

34:09.830 --> 34:12.093
Your man bought a ticket
a few days ago.

34:12.137 --> 34:16.619
Paid cash, but we caught him
on a security camera.

34:16.663 --> 34:18.969
Hurricane Debbie,scheduled
to leave out of the terminal

34:19.013 --> 34:20.928
on Poydras in about 30 minutes.

34:20.971 --> 34:23.148
Riverboat going upstream.
He can slip out at any point.

34:23.191 --> 34:24.888
Yeah, no way anyone's
gonna look for him

34:24.932 --> 34:26.368
amongst all those tourists.

34:26.412 --> 34:28.022
It's the perfect way out.Let's go.

34:28.066 --> 34:29.850
Good work, P.

34:36.335 --> 34:38.119
I'll check the terminal,
verify who's boarding.

34:38.163 --> 34:40.730
Take the riverwalk, double back.
Let's all be careful.

34:55.310 --> 34:56.833
I got eyes on Grassley.

34:56.877 --> 34:59.053
Moving in.

34:59.097 --> 35:00.315
Grassley, wait!

35:00.359 --> 35:02.143
Headed into the aquarium.

35:02.187 --> 35:03.492
Watch out,
watch out!

35:03.536 --> 35:05.146
Cover both exits.

35:05.190 --> 35:06.800
Coming through!

35:06.843 --> 35:08.889
Out of the way!

35:08.932 --> 35:10.151
Excuse me.

35:18.551 --> 35:20.944
Get out of the way,
out of the way.

35:49.277 --> 35:50.278
Grassley!

35:52.062 --> 35:53.977
It's over.

35:54.021 --> 35:56.154
There's nowhere else to go.

36:00.462 --> 36:01.985
Here.

36:03.378 --> 36:05.380
Come get it.

36:20.352 --> 36:21.962
Get back.

36:22.005 --> 36:24.007
Get back.

36:36.150 --> 36:37.195
Stay back.Back up.

36:37.238 --> 36:38.239
Back up. Back up.

36:38.283 --> 36:39.371
Stay back. Stay back.

36:39.414 --> 36:40.589
Back up.Please back up.

36:45.115 --> 36:48.597
I had to. I know.
I was in quarantine.

36:48.641 --> 36:51.426
No. No, not for me.
It was someone else.

36:51.470 --> 36:54.037
Yeah, it's
a long story.

36:54.081 --> 36:57.127
Everything is okay. I know. I...

36:58.303 --> 37:00.043
Uh, I'll-I'll call you later.

37:00.087 --> 37:01.480
Okay, Ryan?

37:03.003 --> 37:04.439
Sorry to interrupt.

37:04.483 --> 37:06.615
No, you didn't. It's just...

37:06.659 --> 37:09.227
Family. I understand.

37:09.270 --> 37:11.359
: Yeah, well,
that makes one of us.

37:11.403 --> 37:13.883
Ryan having a hard time

37:13.927 --> 37:17.757
coming to grips with...

37:17.800 --> 37:19.759
everything?

37:19.802 --> 37:23.371
I-I just... I don't blame him.

37:23.415 --> 37:25.634
It's kind of hard to explain
the last 48 hours

37:25.678 --> 37:28.115
that we've had.

37:28.158 --> 37:30.813
That why you
came back early?

37:30.857 --> 37:33.468
Too much explaining?

37:34.948 --> 37:36.993
Dwayne, I just spent
the last week explaining

37:37.037 --> 37:40.388
and apologizing and reasoning,
and it's just..

37:42.564 --> 37:45.132
It's just exhausting.

37:48.614 --> 37:50.790
You know, it's not Ryan's fault.

37:53.140 --> 37:55.664
We just keep missing each other.

37:55.708 --> 37:58.363
I've been there, Hannah.

38:00.452 --> 38:03.411
How about I buy you a drink,
we talk about it?

38:03.455 --> 38:05.239
How about I buy you a drink,

38:05.283 --> 38:07.023
we talk about anything else?

38:07.067 --> 38:08.024
Deal.

38:08.068 --> 38:09.417
Okay.

38:10.723 --> 38:12.377
Can't believe
you made a sandwich.

38:12.420 --> 38:14.335
I'm hungry.I thought I was
making dinner, though.

38:14.379 --> 38:16.032
Well, how about this? You eat
the dinner you're making,

38:16.076 --> 38:17.469
and I'll eat my sandwich.
Everybody wins.

38:17.512 --> 38:18.992
I spent all morning
braising that chicken.

38:19.035 --> 38:20.515
But I didn't ask you to, did I?

38:20.559 --> 38:22.343
Just like I didn't ask you
to wash my laundry

38:22.387 --> 38:24.389
or organize my drawers--
again, creepy.

38:26.086 --> 38:28.175
All right, listen.
I-I love living with you.

38:28.218 --> 38:29.481
I do.

38:29.524 --> 38:31.657
But I need
a little personal space.

38:31.700 --> 38:33.049
Just a little bit.

38:33.093 --> 38:34.616
You got it.

38:34.660 --> 38:36.357
Good.

38:36.401 --> 38:38.881
So is that a hard no on the
ballroom dancing classes, or...?

38:38.925 --> 38:41.014
I also put us
into a bridge tournament,

38:41.057 --> 38:43.582
but I need you to teach me
how to play bridge.

38:50.415 --> 38:51.720
Commander Nero.

38:51.764 --> 38:53.156
Call me Rufus.

38:53.200 --> 38:56.377
I am so sorry about
Lieutenant Ford.

38:57.857 --> 38:58.945
As am I.

38:58.988 --> 39:01.208
She was a very talented officer.

39:02.296 --> 39:03.645
She's a hero.

39:03.689 --> 39:07.475
Sacrificed herself
to save so many others.

39:08.563 --> 39:11.174
I feel responsible.

39:11.218 --> 39:13.568
Well, she knew the risks.

39:13.612 --> 39:17.006
You can be angry about it,
you can be sad about it,

39:17.050 --> 39:19.531
but, uh, you shouldn't
be self-indulgent.

39:21.837 --> 39:25.406
Not now that I'm finally
warming to you.

39:26.755 --> 39:28.801
To be honest, Ella was a friend,

39:28.844 --> 39:32.239
and believe it or not,
I don't make many of those.

39:32.282 --> 39:33.501
Oh, I believe it.

39:33.545 --> 39:34.981
But play your cards right,

39:35.024 --> 39:36.852
and you may make a new one.

39:40.421 --> 39:43.119
May I take you to dinner?

39:43.163 --> 39:44.294
No.

39:45.470 --> 39:48.124
We could go Dutch.

39:48.168 --> 39:50.649
I'd like that very much.

39:50.692 --> 39:56.219
Well, hurry up, now,
before I change my mind, Rufus.
