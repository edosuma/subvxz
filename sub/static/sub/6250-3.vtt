- That’s awful, Booth.

- No. He was a creep.
- 0/7.

02:15.386 --> 02:18.048
So, then, your agitation
comes from—

02:18.139 --> 02:21.006

in the office building, all right?

before she was put in here.

05:26.952 --> 05:29.910

she was dropped
from quite a height.

It has the control system
for the elevator.

to this room?

and covered in particulates.

and pulling traces to run
through the G.C. mass spec.

07:29.199 --> 07:31.485
sometime between Friday night
and Saturday morning.

And her final meal
was lettuce, yogurt,

Most likely.

07:52.014 --> 07:54.221
So, ball’s in your court,
Fisher.

07:54.308 --> 07:58.768
Dr. Brennan left me with exactly
1,263 bone fragments.

07:58.854 --> 08:02.517
Each one screaming pain,
violence and hopelessness.

08:02.608 --> 08:04.599
So how about cutting me
a little slack?

08:04.693 --> 08:07.776
Thejob gets easier with time,
Mr. Fisher.

08:07.863 --> 08:10.400
Any leads on who she is?

08:10.491 --> 08:11.981
The hot chick
is doing a sketch...

08:12.076 --> 08:14.988
from the few pieces ofskull
I could locate and reconstruct.

08:15.079 --> 08:19.197
- “Hot chick?”
- Sorry. The other hot chick.

08:21.835 --> 08:24.372
It’s a bow...
with hair.

08:25.381 --> 08:28.293
It’s brown, natural colors.

08:31.345 --> 08:33.301
It might help Angela
with her sketch.

08:33.389 --> 08:35.971
Right. You should
give it to her.

08:37.059 --> 08:40.768
I’m... kinda busy.
And I’m kinda your boss.

08:45.901 --> 08:48.187
Anything else, Mr. Fisher?

08:48.278 --> 08:51.236
I also found hairline
impact fissures...

08:51.323 --> 08:53.314
on the lateral epicondyle.

08:53.409 --> 08:55.525
And?

08:55.619 --> 08:58.361

the effect of falls
on human bone.

08:58.455 --> 09:00.491

at my summerjob.

Were you...
for or against?

09:16.056 --> 09:18.593

09:18.684 --> 09:21.721
Look, Hodgins.
We both decided it’s over.

09:21.854 --> 09:26.223

Um, the bow’s
from the victim.

Oh. [Chuckles]
Right.

09:28.318 --> 09:32.061
[C/atters]
Sorry. That’s helpful...
that bow.

09:32.197 --> 09:34.984
How’s it coming?
Well, according
to my sketch...

09:35.075 --> 09:37.236
the victim was
a model for Picasso.

09:37.327 --> 09:39.067
[Chuckles]
Like it.

09:39.163 --> 09:41.905
Mr. Cheerful’s
putting more pieces
together for me.

09:41.999 --> 09:44.206
That’s a good idea.

09:44.293 --> 09:47.330
[Clears Throat]
Just so you know,
uh, I’m cool.

09:47.421 --> 09:50.333
You know, you and I,
we work together and—
and that’s it.

09:50.424 --> 09:52.335
Great.
We’re two professionals.

09:52.426 --> 09:55.133
Yep. Two professionals.

09:57.097 --> 09:58.507
I should finish this.
’Cause this is—

09:58.599 --> 10:00.590
Yeah. Yeah. And, you know,
I’ve got lots to do.

10:00.684 --> 10:02.675
I mean, lots. So—

10:03.729 --> 10:07.813
- Okay.
- Okay.

10:07.900 --> 10:11.893
From the impact fissures,
I’d estimate her fall was
from at least 60 meters.

10:11.987 --> 10:16.777
Okay, first ofall, I doubt even
Dr. Brennan could discoverthat
from impact fissures alone.

10:16.867 --> 10:19.404
My thesis got me here.
Ask her.

10:19.495 --> 10:21.986
And, second,
that doesn’t indicate
what floor she fell from.

10:22.080 --> 10:25.823
The elevator car could’ve been
on any floor in the building
when she landed on it.

10:25.918 --> 10:29.206
But since it’s a 16-story
building, at about 10 feet per floor—

10:29.338 --> 10:32.000
Eleven or 12, ifyou count
the space between floors.
Right.

10:32.090 --> 10:36.584
That’s 252 feet.
That gives us 76.8 meters.

10:36.678 --> 10:38.293
A difference
ofabout 17 meters.

10:38.430 --> 10:39.966
That’s—
Fifty-two feet.

10:40.057 --> 10:43.265
Meaning she had to fall
from the top floor or
the machine room above it.

10:43.352 --> 10:45.593
Very impressive,
Mr. Fisher.

10:45.687 --> 10:50.522
[Sighs]
Well, I’ll still wind up
like her one day.

10:50.609 --> 10:53.351
You ever think of finding
a girlfriend, Mr. Fisher?

10:53.445 --> 10:56.232
I’ve got one.

10:57.574 --> 11:00.281
J ill.
She’s very beautiful.

11:00.369 --> 11:03.953
Yes... now.

11:08.460 --> 11:11.167
Patty Hoyle. She’s one ofthe people
who didn’t check into the building.

11:15.133 --> 11:18.261
What? So Cam is actually
going to write you a letter
so you can get the chair?

11:18.345 --> 11:20.631
That’s right. She understands
how the game is played.

11:20.722 --> 11:22.587
She works for
the same man as you.

11:22.724 --> 11:24.976
That’s right.
The man
who doesn’t exist.

11:26.228 --> 11:29.095
Wow. Can you imagine
working in a place like this?

11:29.189 --> 11:31.726
No. It’s not sterile,
and there’s no room
for diagnostic equioment...

11:31.859 --> 11:34.191
or sufficient bone storage.
No, Bones.

11:34.278 --> 11:36.769
I meant the little cubicles. Look at ’em.
They look like caged animals.

11:36.864 --> 11:39.697
Throughout history,
you can ﬁnd examples
of human beings...

11:39.783 --> 11:41.648
adapting to virtually
any en vironment.

11:41.785 --> 11:44.242
Like you and the chair.
Me? Whoa!
You’re way off base.

11:44.329 --> 11:47.412
Ziff-Young. Hold the line,
please. Ziff-Young.
Hold the line, please.

11:47.499 --> 11:49.035

The whole building’s
been wondering.

It was horrible.

show up to work?

keep it quiet? Please?

- Even painted the frogs.
- Lot of frogs.

- She was that kind of person.
- One who adjusted to
an impersonal workplace.

in her computer.

12:45.641 --> 12:48.599
She was still here when I left, yeah.
Working late as usual.

accept their position
as a drone.

Are you calling me a drone?
Well, it’s not
a pejorative statement.

23:14.852 --> 23:17.309
You got an alibi
after that?
/was online.

23:17.397 --> 23:20.514
I was online playing
Knights of Atlantis.

23:20.608 --> 23:25.853
You can check the log or ask,
uh— uh, Thrustkiller278
or, uh, Donnerparty819.

23:25.947 --> 23:27.778
Right.

23:31.327 --> 23:34.490
Her body sustained severe
postmortem damage—

23:34.581 --> 23:37.823
comminuted crush fractures of
the upper and lower extremities,

23:37.917 --> 23:41.205
burst fractures ofthe thoracic
and lumbar vertebrae,

23:41.296 --> 23:43.287
and sheering
ofthe spinous processes.

23:43.381 --> 23:47.374
- Your reconstruction looks good.
- It’s incomplete. I suck.

23:47.468 --> 23:49.595
This woman was mulched
in an e/e vator shaﬂ‘.

23:49.679 --> 23:51.715
Given her condition,
I’m impressed with your work.

23:51.806 --> 23:54.013
Come on, Mr. Fisher.
Let me see a little smile.

23:56.853 --> 23:58.593
That’s the ticket.

23:58.688 --> 24:03.432
I also found incomplete
bilateral compression fractures
of ribs R3 to R11.

24:03.526 --> 24:06.393
There’s inward deformation
to the lateral aspects.

24:06.487 --> 24:08.478
Curve patterns are consistent
with the outer edge ofa shoe.

24:08.573 --> 24:12.737
/ looked at se vera/ sections
of the epidermis from the area
of pa tterned abrasions.

24:12.827 --> 24:15.364
Didn’t find any hemorrhage
in the soft tissue.

24:15.455 --> 24:17.992
So she was stomped postmortem.

24:18.124 --> 24:21.742
Why stomp on someone
when they’re already dead?
Good question.

24:21.836 --> 24:23.952
And I have another.
Did you figure out
cause of death yet?

24:24.047 --> 24:26.538
I told you, man. I suck.

24:28.343 --> 24:33.383
Buck up, Mr. Fisher.
You give me cause ofdeath,
I give you a Kierkegaard T-shirt.

24:43.483 --> 24:46.190
Hey.
Hello.

24:46.319 --> 24:48.856
Your fries look good.
You want some?

24:48.946 --> 24:52.530
Ifyou don’t want ’em.
So I need some advice.

24:52.617 --> 24:55.575
I have office hours,
Miss Montenegro. This is—

24:55.662 --> 24:58.870
Look, how do I
deal with Hodgins?
I mean, we broke up.

24:58.956 --> 25:00.867
So Ijust want it
to be over with...

25:00.958 --> 25:03.244
so I can get back to work
without all this unspoken drama.

25:03.336 --> 25:04.872
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

25:07.048 --> 25:11.417
Well, uh, first, I think it’s important
to find out what went wrong,

25:11.511 --> 25:14.719
why you were involved
in an unsuccessful relationship.

25:14.847 --> 25:17.839
Who said it was unsuccessful?
You’re not together anymore,
are you?

25:17.975 --> 25:21.058
Do you love your parents?
Yes.

25:21.145 --> 25:23.056
But you don’t
live together anymore.

25:23.147 --> 25:25.399
Does that mean your relationship
with Mom and Dad was unsuccessful?

25:25.525 --> 25:28.562
I don’t think it’s the same.
I do.

25:28.653 --> 25:31.565
Sometimes you have to move on,
whatever your feelings.

25:31.656 --> 25:34.193
When we create intimate
sexual relationships,

25:34.283 --> 25:37.275
and ifthe relationship isn’t
functioning the way it should,

25:37.370 --> 25:42.581
one is left with anxiety and confusion
that will remain until dealt with.

25:42.667 --> 25:45.158
Okay. So let’s deal with it.

25:45.253 --> 25:47.369
It’s gonna take longer
than us sitting here
for a few minutes.

25:47.463 --> 25:50.375
We need to find out why
you were attracted to him
in the first place.

25:50.466 --> 25:54.175
He has kind eyes,
great sense of humor,
cute ass—

25:54.303 --> 25:56.510
He does this thing
where—
No.

25:56.597 --> 26:00.886
No, um, I meant, what are those
things in your past that have
led you to Dr. Hodgins...

26:00.977 --> 26:03.434
and what he represents to you
as an archetype.

26:03.521 --> 26:06.103
You know what? I’m gonna
look at my schedule.

26:06.190 --> 26:08.977
But, uh, we should probably
start by meeting twice a week.

26:09.068 --> 26:11.559
No. I think I’m okay.

26:11.696 --> 26:14.108
Therapy can’t be rushed.
Look, Sweets.

26:14.198 --> 26:17.486
The way I look at it,
if I’m shot by an arrow,

26:17.577 --> 26:19.488
I-I don’t need to know
where the arrow was made,

26:19.579 --> 26:24.289
or what kind of bow
it came from or even
who it was who shot me.

26:24.375 --> 26:27.833
Ijust need to get it
out of my chest.
[Sighs]

26:27.920 --> 26:32.289
So, thank you.
This has been helpful.

26:32.383 --> 26:34.965
[Chuckles]
You’re good.

26:35.094 --> 26:38.803
Mmm.
Thanks for the fries.

26:38.890 --> 26:41.051
Go ahead.
Help yourself.

26:43.186 --> 26:46.678
Found another mystery stain
on this piece of her skirt.

26:47.857 --> 26:51.349
lt’s body fluid.
So it ’5 your problem.

26:57.492 --> 26:59.403
[Saroyan ]
What have we here?

26:59.494 --> 27:01.985
Do you think I’m off my game
because ofAngela?

27:02.079 --> 27:04.536
Because ofall this
residual stuff between us?

27:04.624 --> 27:06.706
Every time I look at her,
I still think about—

27:06.834 --> 27:08.745
Semen.
What? No.

27:08.836 --> 27:11.452
I was gonna say
something much more
romantic than that.

27:11.547 --> 27:15.210
- This stain, it’s semen.
- Oh. Right.

27:15.301 --> 27:19.715
I was also given a swatch
of carpet from the copy room
that had a stain. Also semen.

27:19.806 --> 27:22.138
Now we know the victim
was on the floor
ofthe copy room...

27:22.225 --> 27:25.433
and that there were
semen stains on the floor
and now on her skirt?

27:25.520 --> 27:28.512
My guess is
the stains will match.

27:32.318 --> 27:35.355
[Booth]
Patty Hoyle ordered
uh, food Fr/da y n/ght.

27:35.446 --> 27:38.813
Had it delivered to the office.
Guess whose credit card she used?

27:38.908 --> 27:41.650
Well, I really don’t have enough data
to make an educated guess.

27:41.744 --> 27:44.702
Oh, her boss’s.
Gary Flannery.

27:44.831 --> 27:46.742
[Elevator Dings ]
[ C hattering ]

27:46.833 --> 27:50.496
So Cam is comparing the semen
found on the floor with
the stain found on the skirt.

27:50.586 --> 27:54.875
Mmm. It seems like pretty Patty
was sleeping her way up
the food chain with the boss.

27:54.966 --> 27:58.504
Flannery’s married.
Maybe she threatened
to expose the affair,

27:58.594 --> 28:00.846
and he decided to kill her
to keep her quiet.

28:00.930 --> 28:04.297
Just because tech support
is in India doesn’t mean
I get special treatment.

28:04.392 --> 28:06.804
Patty knew that.
Just call them, please.

28:06.894 --> 28:08.885
[Clears Throat]
Excuse me,
Mr. Flannery.

28:08.980 --> 28:12.188
I’d like to ask you
a few questions about
your credit card statement.

28:12.316 --> 28:15.433
And I’d like to ask him
for a DNA. sample.
Now.

28:23.452 --> 28:26.580
Patty was a valued employee,
and that is all.

28:26.664 --> 28:29.326
Come on. Do you think
I’m gonna slam you
for having a little fun?

28:29.417 --> 28:31.954
It happens.
Late-night meetings.

28:32.044 --> 28:35.377
- A little cleavage.
- No. I’m a married man.

28:35.464 --> 28:37.170
Then why did you give her
your credit card?

28:37.258 --> 28:39.340
Uh, for the occasional
business expense.

28:39.427 --> 28:42.385
- Room service, massage—
-Mmm

28:42.471 --> 28:46.931
Shiatsu— one hour— a purse,
300 dollars’ worth of lingerie.

28:47.018 --> 28:48.724
I was not having sex
with Patty!

28:48.811 --> 28:51.348
- Why did she have your credit card?
- And semen on her skirt?

28:51.439 --> 28:53.725
No!

28:53.816 --> 28:56.182
[Murmurs]

28:56.277 --> 28:59.269
Patty decided to run
an expendables audit.

28:59.363 --> 29:03.151
All right?
She wanted to account
for every damn pencil.

29:03.242 --> 29:08.327
And she found out I was
ordering extra office supplies
and selling to Surplus Online.

29:08.414 --> 29:10.245
She was gonna report me
to corporate.

29:10.333 --> 29:14.702
But she said she would keep
her mouth shut ifI let her
use my card now and then.

29:14.795 --> 29:16.706
Oh, she had the whole office
under her thumb.

29:16.797 --> 29:19.413
Knew everyone’s business,
the sneaky bitch.

29:19.508 --> 29:23.217
So she was b/ackmai/ing you.
That’s not easy to stop, is it?

29:23.304 --> 29:25.966
But I didn’t kill her!
Please.

29:26.057 --> 29:29.015
You can’t tell the head office.
I’ve got a family.

29:29.101 --> 29:31.353
I could lose myjob,
my health care, my pension!

29:31.437 --> 29:32.973
Shut up.
Open your mouth.

29:34.941 --> 29:37.182
Ahh.

29:38.653 --> 29:41.611
What ha ve you found?
The pelvis.

29:41.697 --> 29:44.780
The anteroposterior diameter
is 160 millimeters.

29:44.867 --> 29:49.076
Transverse diameter
is 240 millimeters.

29:49.163 --> 29:51.074
Listen to me.
[Chuckles]

29:51.165 --> 29:55.955
Reducing the pelvic inlet,
the orifice oflife,
to a numerical abstract.

29:56.045 --> 30:00.414
We need mathematical constructs
to understand any aspect
ofour world, Mr. Fisher.

30:00.508 --> 30:02.749
And those figures and equations
are beautiful.

30:02.843 --> 30:05.459
Like a musical composition,
they give life meaning...

30:05.554 --> 30:08.591
and us the poss/b/l/ty
of kno wing the unkno wab/e.

30:10.101 --> 30:12.558
Right.

30:13.813 --> 30:15.929
There’s no evidence that
the body was disarticulated...

30:16.023 --> 30:18.605
prior to being
shoved down the chute.

30:18.693 --> 30:20.900
So she either went in
headfirst or feet first.

30:20.987 --> 30:24.946
Given that, I’ve cut a hole
that corresponds to
the measurements ofthe chute.

30:25.032 --> 30:27.318
There’s only one problem.

30:27.410 --> 30:30.777
Any way you turn it,
the pelvis won’t fit.

30:32.623 --> 30:35.160
So the body couldn’t
have entered the shaft
by that chute.

30:35.251 --> 30:37.583
But since it still
had to fall a minimum
of 60 meters—

30:37.670 --> 30:40.912
It was dumped from the 16th floor.
I’ll call Booth.

30:41.007 --> 30:44.465
D.N.A. results came back.
The two semen stains
are a match—

30:44.552 --> 30:47.259
the one from her skirt
and the one from
the copy room ﬂoor.

30:47.346 --> 30:49.257
But they’re not
from the boss. Sorry.

30:56.605 --> 30:59.017
- Hey.
- Hey.

30:59.108 --> 31:01.520
Uh, hi.

31:01.610 --> 31:04.647
Look, this tension between us,
I hate it.

31:04.739 --> 31:06.900
I mean, I know that
we broke up and everything.

31:06.991 --> 31:10.950
But I’ve experienced loss before
and lived through it. And you have too.

31:11.037 --> 31:13.949
I’m not gonna pretend this
didn’t happen because it
might be easier that way.

31:14.040 --> 31:17.077
I’m gonna relive us
huddled last winter
in that cabin in Montana...

31:17.168 --> 31:19.079
when the lights went out
and the heat went out...

31:19.170 --> 31:23.038
and laughing our asses off
when you tried explaining
that spectrometer thingy to me.

31:23.132 --> 31:26.420
So I’m not gonna hide anymore.
And I’m not gonna walk on eggshells.

31:26.510 --> 31:28.717
I’m just gonna accept that
this whole damn mess happened,

31:28.804 --> 31:31.637
and, pain or not,
I’m glad it did.

31:33.267 --> 31:34.768
Okay.

31:39.356 --> 31:41.642
[ Exhales]
Right.

31:43.736 --> 31:46.273
So Forensics
didn’t find any prints?

31:46.363 --> 31:51.824
[Sighs] No. Cleaning crew
came in over the weekend and
wiped down the elevator doors.

31:51.911 --> 31:54.493
Well, no blood.
What’s that?

31:54.622 --> 31:56.203
VVhat?
That

31:56.290 --> 31:59.407
Those are my cupcakes. I got ’em
for the HR. officer at work.

31:59.502 --> 32:02.084
- I heard she loves ’em.
- So fraud and bribery?

32:02.171 --> 32:05.004
No, 12 years of service
and lumbar support, okay?

32:05.091 --> 32:07.002
It’s all a matter of perception.

32:07.093 --> 32:09.800
[Scoffs]
Okay.

32:09.887 --> 32:13.254
Don’t say it like that.
“Okay,” like I’m
some kind ofa kid.

32:13.349 --> 32:15.340
Okay.

32:15.434 --> 32:18.471
It’s looking
pretty good too, Bones.
I mean, Willie Ackerman?

32:18.562 --> 32:22.771
He got cut offthe list
’cause he got his note
from an acupuncturist.

32:22.858 --> 32:26.396
And that doesn’t
even count. Ha! Boob.

32:26.487 --> 32:28.944
Watch out.
I’m gonna try this again.

32:29.031 --> 32:32.569
Oh, man!
Ah, forget it!

32:32.660 --> 32:36.653
There’s no way that
I could keep that open
long enough to dump a body.

32:36.789 --> 32:40.327
And I’m in shape.
Must’ve been someone
that was stronger than you.

32:40.417 --> 32:42.544
You’re kidding me, right?
Have you seen the people
in these offices?

32:42.670 --> 32:46.128
Compared to them,
I’m Hercules.
Oh, apparently not.

32:46.215 --> 32:48.422
Maybe you do need that chair.

32:48.509 --> 32:50.875
Or maybe it was two people.

32:52.012 --> 32:54.754
1,263 bone fragments,

32:54.849 --> 32:57.090
and I’ve checked
every single one ofthem.

32:57.184 --> 32:59.971
The only cause of death
I see is on the squamous
temporal bone.

33:00.062 --> 33:04.931
The localized staining
would be consistent
with blunt—force trauma.

33:05.025 --> 33:07.061
Except there’s no sign of that
on the exterior of the skull.

33:07.153 --> 33:10.065
Then it was probably caused
by a ruptured aneurysm.

33:10.156 --> 33:12.647
Which would make her death
an accident.

33:12.741 --> 33:16.780
And our pursuit for a villain
merely a cry forjustice
in an unjust world.

33:16.871 --> 33:21.035
But if it’s an accident,
it wouldn’t account
for the elevator or the semen.

33:21.125 --> 33:23.207
True.
[Sighs]

33:23.294 --> 33:26.331
Ishou/d’ve found that earlier.
[S/ghs ]

33:27.339 --> 33:29.250
Dr. Brennan’s gonna fire me,
isn’t she?

33:29.341 --> 33:32.333
/ guess, wh/le / was trying
to see the metaphorical sun,

33:32.428 --> 33:36.762
I totally forgot that
the chances ofsurvival
in an unfriendly cosmos—

33:36.849 --> 33:39.465
- Have you considered
Prozac, Mr. Fisher?
- Already on it.

33:39.560 --> 33:42.017
Then double your dose.
’Cause you’re
bringing me down.

33:42.104 --> 33:45.016
And that’s hard to do,
’cause I have worked
with death for years.

33:45.107 --> 33:47.018
And you are making it
all look like good times now.

33:47.109 --> 33:49.395
So get it together,
okay, Eeyore?

33:49.486 --> 33:51.397
- What have you found?
- [Saroyan ] An aneurysm.

33:51.488 --> 33:54.025
It should’ve been
caused by trauma to
the ectocranial surface.

33:54.158 --> 33:57.446
But there’s no evidence
oftrauma at all.
Very good, Mr. Fisher.

34:00.873 --> 34:03.285
What do you see there?

34:03.375 --> 34:07.584
Two tiny punctures approximately
seven millimeters apart.

34:07.671 --> 34:11.960
And what’s very good?
I totally missed them!

34:12.051 --> 34:13.882
You found the hemorrhagic stain
that led us here.

34:13.969 --> 34:15.675
[ Fisher]
So what caused them—
snake fangs?

34:15.763 --> 34:19.096
Eastern pipistrelle bat?
Uh, a vampire?

34:19.183 --> 34:21.265
Fingerprint powder.

34:23.854 --> 34:25.936
[Fisher]
What are you doing?

34:27.608 --> 34:32.227
A fine horizontal barterminating
in two vertical protrusions.

34:32.321 --> 34:34.937
Oh, my God.

34:35.032 --> 34:37.318
She was killed by a staple.

34:42.373 --> 34:44.284
A staple?
Mm-hmm.

34:44.375 --> 34:46.286
How do you kill somebody
with a staple?

34:46.377 --> 34:50.541
It perforated the thinnest
part ofthe calvarium,
the squamous temporal bone,

34:50.631 --> 34:53.919
causing Miss Hoyle’s
pre-existing aneurysm
to rupture.

34:54.009 --> 34:56.261
How do you get somebody
to stand still while you staple them?

34:56.345 --> 35:00.429
There’s a small depression
near the wound that suggests
the stapler was thrown.

35:00.557 --> 35:03.299
So whoever did this
didn’t mean to kill her.
No, I can’t confirm that.

35:03.394 --> 35:06.602
It’s common sense, Bones.
One doesn’t usually use
a stapler as a murder weapon.

35:06.689 --> 35:09.522
And they certainly
couldn’t have known
that she had an aneurysm.

35:10.693 --> 35:12.604
I’ll concede on both points.
Tell you what.

35:12.695 --> 35:15.437
My boys are looking
for the murder weapon.
Maybe we can pull some prints.

35:15.531 --> 35:18.694
Patty has sex with someone
who then hits her with a stapler.

35:18.784 --> 35:20.490
It’s an odd work environment.

35:20.577 --> 35:22.442
Okay, you are not
gonna believe this.

35:22.538 --> 35:24.779
Yeah? Try topping
death by office supplies.

35:24.873 --> 35:27.615
I was racking my brain
over the trace analysis
from the sweater.

35:27.710 --> 35:31.168
Furfural, proteolytic enzyme,
triarylmethane dye—

35:31.255 --> 35:33.667
Hodgins, Hodgins, Hodgins.
Eyes are glazing over.

35:33.757 --> 35:35.213
It’s a Blue Hawaiian.

35:35.342 --> 35:38.379
What’s a Blue Hawaiian?
Oh, it’s a potent cocktail.

35:38.470 --> 35:40.506
Two of those puppies,
and you’re asking yourself,

35:40.597 --> 35:42.929
“Hey, why am I naked
and who are all these people?”

35:43.017 --> 35:44.973
[ Hodgins ]
Br/l/iant blue F. C F.
from the blue curacao.

35:45.060 --> 35:49.975
Furfura/ from the rum.
Pro teo/ytic enzyme— pineapple.
Alcohol speaks for itself

35:50.065 --> 35:53.307
Is this the sort of
beverage they would serve
at the Paradise Isle?

35:53.402 --> 35:55.734
Yeah. Comes in one ofthose,
uh, ceramic monkey heads.

35:56.947 --> 35:59.654
So the killer must’ve
stepped in a spilled drink.

35:59.742 --> 36:02.324
Given the high level
of fructose and sugarcane,
it would’ve adhered to his shoe.

36:02.411 --> 36:04.322
He stomps on the victim,
and presto—

36:04.413 --> 36:06.654
her sweater lights up
with more traces
than a luau pig.

36:06.749 --> 36:09.491
Dave was at Paradise Isle.
But his alibi checks out.

36:09.585 --> 36:12.998
Yeah. But Dave was there with Chip,
who gave him a ride home.

36:13.088 --> 36:16.205
But we don’t know what Chip did
for the rest ofthe night.

36:16.342 --> 36:19.004
Good work, Hodgins.
Now you can have a french fry.
Thanks. Hey, man.

36:19.136 --> 36:22.594
Hey, I think Angela and I
are cool now.
[ Cell Phone Ringing]

36:22.681 --> 36:24.967
- We talked, and I think—
- Brennan.

36:25.059 --> 36:26.924
You know what?
Just keep it to yourself.

36:27.019 --> 36:29.010
We ’ll be right there.
[ Qu/et/y]
We gotta go.

36:29.104 --> 36:31.186
Have all the fries you want.
Pay the bill too.

36:31.273 --> 36:34.015
I wanted to talk to you guys...
about... Angela.

36:34.109 --> 36:36.896
/ was ﬁling the D. NA. test
/ran on Gary’s saliva.

36:36.987 --> 36:38.898
Oh, it does match
after all?
No.

36:38.989 --> 36:42.652
But I did double-check the semen
sample from the victim’s skirt
with the one on the floor.

36:42.743 --> 36:44.654
And they do match.

36:44.745 --> 36:48.784
And according to
the deterioration
ofthe sperm tail,

36:48.874 --> 36:50.455
the ejaculate’s
from Friday night.

36:50.584 --> 36:54.042
That must’ve been
some happy hour.
The night she was murdered.

36:54.129 --> 36:56.085
You can tell all that
from their little tails?

36:56.173 --> 36:59.131
Yes. And I can also tell
that our man is probably
ofAsian descent.

36:59.218 --> 37:00.924
Oh. By the way
they swim.

37:01.011 --> 37:04.924
No. From 42 specific
DNA. sequences.

37:06.183 --> 37:08.720
Yeah.
Probably more exact.

37:08.811 --> 37:11.803
/’m not sure ifthat’s helpful.
There are three bill/on
Asian people In the world

37:11.939 --> 37:15.727
But only one who works
in the office.
And he was at Paradise Isle.

37:15.818 --> 37:17.979
Found the murder weapon, Chip.

37:18.070 --> 37:20.026
A stapler?
Yep, stapler.

37:20.114 --> 37:22.856
- Picked it up in a Dumpster
behind your building.
- Someone threw/t at her

37:22.950 --> 37:27.614
We found some of Patty’s hair
embedded in the slide, as well
as a trace of blood.

37:29.915 --> 37:34.079
So, uh, what do you need from me?
I’ll help any way I can. I liked Patty.

37:34.169 --> 37:36.876
Enough to make love to her
in the copy room on the floor?

37:36.964 --> 37:41.298
[Chuckles]
God, no. She was my boss.

37:41.385 --> 37:44.969
We also found semen
on the floor ofthe copy room
and on her skirt.

37:45.055 --> 37:47.091
The D. N.A. showed
it was from an Asian male.

37:47.182 --> 37:50.424
You’re the only person
ofAsian descent
in the office, Chip.

37:50.519 --> 37:54.979
Look at this.
We have a court order here
for your DNA.

38:00.654 --> 38:05.694
Okay, you’re right.
I was sleeping with Patty.
But I wanted to end it.

38:05.784 --> 38:08.947
So /had a couple drinks
to get up my courage
and went back to the ofﬁce.

38:09.037 --> 38:11.528
- Then what happened?
- I told her we had to stop.

38:11.623 --> 38:13.534
Because we were
gonna get caught.

38:13.625 --> 38:17.368
She threatened to report me
for sexual harassment ifI didn’t
keep sleeping with her.

38:17.463 --> 38:19.294
She was calling Gary to report me.

38:19.381 --> 38:22.464
- So you threw the stapler at her?
- It hit her in the head.

38:22.551 --> 38:24.712
And shejust... dropped.

38:24.803 --> 38:27.795
She had an aneurysm.
You ruptured it.

38:27.890 --> 38:29.926
- I didn’t know!
- Then what?

38:30.017 --> 38:32.975
I... had to get rid of her.

38:33.061 --> 38:35.768
I panicked,
dragged her into the hall...

38:35.856 --> 38:39.644
opened the elevator doors
and sho ved her down the shalt.

38:39.735 --> 38:42.067
How?

38:42.154 --> 38:44.110
What do you mean “how?”

[Straining]

38:49.828 --> 38:52.069
[Gasps]

38:52.164 --> 38:54.155
It must’ve been the adrenaline.

38:54.249 --> 38:56.160
You know with that,
you can lift a car, right?

38:56.251 --> 38:58.287
Is this enough adrenaline
for you?

38:58.378 --> 39:01.336
[Whimpers, Gasps]
Okay.

39:09.389 --> 39:11.971
Look at that. Two people.
Who’s helping you?

39:12.059 --> 39:14.015
No one! It wasjust me.

39:14.102 --> 39:17.139
Somebody had to have helped you
hold the doors open while you
kicked her down the shaft.

39:17.272 --> 39:19.103
No!
Who are you protecting,
Chipper?

39:19.233 --> 39:21.724
Booth,
can you take the door?
Got/t. Got/t.

39:22.945 --> 39:24.435
All right.

39:24.530 --> 39:26.521
[Brennan]
There.

39:34.665 --> 39:38.032
Okay, what is that?
It looks like a piece
of fingernail.

39:38.168 --> 39:40.875
Blue nail polish.
[Sighs]

39:47.469 --> 39:49.425
Chip tried to protect me?

39:50.597 --> 39:54.931
Yes.
That’sjust like him,
you know?

39:55.018 --> 39:58.101
Whenever I have too many
calls on hold, he’d always
answer the phone.

39:58.188 --> 40:00.224
He totally didn’t have to do that.

40:00.315 --> 40:04.524
The best way for you to help him
isjust to tell me the truth.

40:05.737 --> 40:09.821
Okay. Well, we both
have roommates.

40:11.827 --> 40:15.740
So... sometimes,

40:15.831 --> 40:17.742
we’d make love in the office.

40:19.334 --> 40:21.586
We were in the copy room...

40:21.670 --> 40:23.581
and we thought we were alone.

40:23.672 --> 40:28.382
But Patty came back for something,
and she caught us.

40:28.468 --> 40:30.959
And she said she was
going to report us.

40:31.054 --> 40:32.965
I mean, no one
in the office could date.

40:33.056 --> 40:35.923
It was against company policy.
She said we’d both be fired.

40:36.018 --> 40:37.849
So you threw the stapler.

40:37.936 --> 40:40.678
H was so sick of her
sticking her nose in everything.

40:42.441 --> 40:46.684
She-She went over to the phone
to report us to Gary. And—

40:49.615 --> 40:52.652
I threw the stapler.
I didn’t mean to kill her.

41:23.982 --> 41:26.439

The chair.
Looks nice.

41:26.526 --> 41:29.814
Another victory for the hive.

41:29.946 --> 41:31.982
H.R. said you called.
Yes.

41:32.074 --> 41:35.282
- But I didn’t lie to them.
I wouldn’t do that.
- You must’ve said something.

41:35.369 --> 41:38.361
Because she didn’t even
eat her cupcakes,
and the chair was here.

41:38.455 --> 41:41.788
No. Ijust told them
why I felt it was important
for you to have it. That’s all.

41:41.875 --> 41:45.413
And, uh, why is that?
Because even a mindless drone—

41:45.504 --> 41:49.338
[Sighs]
deserves some perks?

41:49.424 --> 41:52.291
No. Because of how important
you are to them.

41:52.386 --> 41:56.504
I mentioned your dedication
and courage and sensitivity.

41:56.640 --> 41:58.551
Sensitivity?
Yes, Booth.

41:58.642 --> 42:01.258
I mean, even today
with that young woman
who killed her boss.

42:01.353 --> 42:03.264
It’s very impressive.

42:04.690 --> 42:09.059
Anyway, I said that
a chair is a good way...

42:09.152 --> 42:12.861
to show the other employees
in the office...

42:12.948 --> 42:15.781
how much those qualities
are valued.

42:15.867 --> 42:18.449
Hmm. Well, it worked.

42:18.537 --> 42:21.904
I’ll never understand why
you felt you had to lie
to get the chair.

42:21.998 --> 42:24.831
I mean, you could’ve
just told them about
yourselfon your own.

42:24.918 --> 42:27.534
Because that
would’ve been bragging,
even though it was true. Oh!

42:27.671 --> 42:30.959

You okay?

42:31.049 --> 42:36.134

the attributes ofthe chair?

42:43.145 --> 42:44.885
No. No.

42:44.980 --> 42:47.141
Oh, this thing is great.
Kidding me?

42:47.232 --> 42:51.316
It’s, uh—
Even though it’s an antique.

42:51.403 --> 42:56.272
It doesn’t tilt back... yet.
And it smells like
a 300-pound dead guy.

42:56.366 --> 42:59.654

- Are you kidding me? Love it!
