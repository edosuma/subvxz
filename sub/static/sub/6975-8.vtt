36:29.534 --> 36:31.229
Clothes are gone.

36:31.469 --> 36:33.232
Tammi left in a hurry.

36:33.471 --> 36:35.962
Maybe she thought
someone was after her.

36:36.040 --> 36:38.167
Someone's after you,
you don't pack.

36:38.209 --> 36:40.507
You leave with
what you're wearing.

36:40.545 --> 36:42.672
You think she planned to go?

36:42.747 --> 36:43.714
I do.

36:43.781 --> 36:45.476
The question is, where?

36:49.587 --> 36:51.680
Who are you calling?

36:51.756 --> 36:53.986
Whoever Tammi called last.

36:54.058 --> 36:56.618
Welcome to Concordia Bus Lines.

36:56.694 --> 36:59.060
Our menu options have changed.

36:59.097 --> 37:01.531
For reservations, press one.

37:19.284 --> 37:21.514
- Tammi.
- Dwight!

37:21.586 --> 37:24.578
Is this what you had
in your little secret box? Hmm?

37:24.656 --> 37:26.317
A safety-deposit key.

37:26.558 --> 37:30.585
Looks like you had
a lot of my money in there.

37:30.662 --> 37:32.596
Dwight.

37:32.664 --> 37:33.688
Shut up and drive.

37:33.765 --> 37:34.857
Drive!

38:11.235 --> 38:14.568
So this is how you did it, hmm?

38:14.639 --> 38:17.608
You kept two sets of books.

38:17.675 --> 38:18.733
Huh.

38:18.810 --> 38:21.745
You've been ripping
me off for months.

38:21.779 --> 38:24.111
There's a hundred thousand
dollars difference here.

38:24.182 --> 38:25.945
That's why you were in
such a hurry the other morning.

38:26.017 --> 38:28.747
- Dwight.
- Shut up!

38:28.820 --> 38:32.017
Randall should've
killed you, not Chase.

38:32.090 --> 38:34.991
Or maybe you and Carlton
were working together?

38:35.059 --> 38:36.356
It wasn't like that.

38:36.594 --> 38:39.995
When Carlton found out about
the money, he blackmailed me.

38:40.064 --> 38:41.292
He made me...

38:43.067 --> 38:44.591
do things.

38:44.669 --> 38:47.331
Oh, I bet you
put up a big fight.

38:49.207 --> 38:50.299
Wait a minute.

38:50.341 --> 38:52.206
If Carlton wasn't
stealing from me...

38:52.276 --> 38:54.005
then why did Randall kill him?

38:57.348 --> 39:01.182
Dwight, you don't understand.

39:01.219 --> 39:02.982
No, no, no. I do understand.

39:03.054 --> 39:04.817
My brother was sweet on you.

39:04.889 --> 39:06.857
He killed Carlton
because he knew...

39:06.924 --> 39:09.324
what was going on
between the two of you.

39:09.394 --> 39:10.224
No!

39:12.430 --> 39:15.058
Where the hell you been?

39:15.133 --> 39:17.294
Hmm?

39:17.368 --> 39:18.892
I got something
for you to do.

39:18.970 --> 39:22.371
[Tammi Whimpers ]

39:22.440 --> 39:24.032
Randall, get over here!

39:33.885 --> 39:35.648
Dwight. No.

39:35.720 --> 39:37.119
Take it.

39:42.427 --> 39:44.452
She ripped us off, Randall...

39:44.696 --> 39:45.958
and you knew it.

39:46.030 --> 39:47.861
No, Randall--

39:47.932 --> 39:50.093
What did you think?
That the two of you...

39:50.134 --> 39:52.466
were going to run off
into the sunset together?

39:55.039 --> 39:56.802
She used you.

40:00.745 --> 40:01.837
Look at me, Randall.

40:07.351 --> 40:13.119
I'm the one who loves you,
not her.

40:13.191 --> 40:17.287
Not anybody else.

40:17.361 --> 40:19.989
Because we're blood.

40:22.200 --> 40:24.691
That's thicker than anything.

40:35.046 --> 40:38.072
I'm going to walk away now...

40:38.149 --> 40:41.312
and I'm going to think hard
about how I can forgive you.

40:51.162 --> 40:53.096
You know what you got to do.

41:07.912 --> 41:09.174
Randall.

41:13.151 --> 41:15.051
You're not going to do this.

41:20.391 --> 41:23.758
[Whimpering ]

41:28.232 --> 41:31.030
Randall, please.

41:34.172 --> 41:37.335
I was coming back for you.

41:43.181 --> 41:44.842
No, you weren't.

41:50.888 --> 41:52.253
Randall!

41:54.592 --> 41:55.854
No!

41:55.927 --> 41:57.519
[ Gunshot ]

42:17.815 --> 42:19.874
[ Doggett ]
Agent.

42:19.951 --> 42:21.316
Has he said anything?

42:21.385 --> 42:23.410
Well, a county D.A.
came in...

42:23.487 --> 42:25.455
and he declined representation.

42:25.523 --> 42:28.321
Aside from that,
he's been uncommunicative.

42:33.297 --> 42:36.232
APB on Tammi Peyton's
a wash so far.

42:36.300 --> 42:39.064
The Bureau in Montana's
on alert.

42:44.475 --> 42:47.842
He watched her every day...

42:47.912 --> 42:49.140
wherever she was.

42:49.213 --> 42:52.080
A man who can look at
anything in the world...

42:52.149 --> 42:54.014
and he chooses her.

42:57.221 --> 43:02.853
He must've seen something in her
she couldn't see in herself.

43:02.927 --> 43:07.125
Well, if you're suggesting he could
see into her heart, Agent...

43:07.198 --> 43:10.895
I think we're out of FBI
territory on this one.

43:13.504 --> 43:15.096
I'll be out front.

44:27.979 --> 44:29.447
[Child ]
I made this!

44:29.447 --> 44:32.439
[Child ]
I made this!
