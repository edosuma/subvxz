WEBVTT

00:11.197 --> 00:12.818
Slow down!

00:12.818 --> 00:15.862
Hey Daphne, guess what Eddie ate in the park today?

00:15.862 --> 00:18.138
Ooh let's see. A hot dog wrapper?

00:18.138 --> 00:19.475
No. Guess again.

00:19.475 --> 00:21.245
A cigarette butt?
No. Guess again.

00:21.245 --> 00:23.252
Apple core?
No. Guess again.

00:23.252 --> 00:26.301
Oh really, must you two play this ridiculous game?

00:26.301 --> 00:29.473
She makes some feeble stab and you say "No. Guess again."

00:29.473 --> 00:38.361
Then she starts flailing away with even more ludicrous answers, all the while you chanting
"Guess again", until she's gibbering like some auctioneer with a bad bladder.

00:38.361 --> 00:41.591
Then you finally reveal the answer at which point nobody even cares.

00:41.591 --> 00:44.789
I'm not sure which one of us got the worst of that, but I think it was you.

00:44.789 --> 00:47.401
Guess again.

00:53.363 --> 00:54.850
Niles.

00:54.850 --> 00:58.326
There's a half-eaten lizard in your elevator!

00:58.326 --> 01:02.626
And that's the last hint you're getting.

01:02.626 --> 01:05.871
Oh Frasier, I had a breakthrough today with one of my compulsive gamblers

01:05.871 --> 01:08.662
and he gave me two tickets to the racetrack on Saturday.

01:08.662 --> 01:10.952
It's a luxury box ?I though you might want to go.

01:10.952 --> 01:14.065
Oh I would love to Niles. Why don't you want to use them?

01:14.065 --> 01:16.805
Well, the jockeys if you must know.

01:16.805 --> 01:17.983
What?

01:17.983 --> 01:27.559
Diminutive, underweight figures in expensive silks wielding riding crops. It just reminded me too much of Maris.

01:27.559 --> 01:30.679
Dad, what about you? I've never known you to turn down the horses.

01:30.679 --> 01:32.931
Ah, sorry. I've got poker with the guys.

01:32.931 --> 01:38.097
Oh well then. I'll just call one of my friends.

01:41.538 --> 01:44.237
Jeez. This is sort of embarrassing.

01:44.237 --> 01:46.693
The first three names on my list are all back in Boston.

01:46.693 --> 01:48.500
What about someone from your wine club?

01:48.500 --> 01:52.515
Oh well truth be told Daphne, those people are insufferable bores unless they have a glass in their hands.

01:52.515 --> 01:55.971
Sherry, Niles?
Please.

01:55.971 --> 01:59.353
Oh I know. How about Ed O'Hanlon?

01:59.353 --> 02:00.929
Moved away last year.

02:00.929 --> 02:05.340
Ooh, how about Edmund Kelly? If I know old Ed he'd never leave Seattle.

02:05.340 --> 02:09.145
Indeed not. They buried him here three years ago.

02:09.145 --> 02:12.382
Dear me. Really? I'll miss him.

02:12.382 --> 02:18.720
Yes. Three years from now when you think of him again  there'll be a void!

02:18.720 --> 02:20.346
My God how did this happen?

02:20.346 --> 02:22.863
I've been back here for two years and I've yet to forge any new friendships.

02:22.863 --> 02:24.548
You'd better watch it Frasier.

02:24.548 --> 02:37.805
Next thing you know you're gonna be like one of these old people who are so set in their ways
that they're only happy hanging around with people who are the same as they are.

02:37.805 --> 02:42.437
What exactly is your point Dad? That I've lost my knack for making friends?

02:42.437 --> 02:45.884
Well I hate to bring it up but you never were very good at it.

02:45.884 --> 02:48.952
It was always you and Niles ever since you were kids.

02:48.952 --> 02:51.940
The two of you always holed up in that damned garage ?

02:51.940 --> 02:55.198
at least until you burned it down.

02:55.198 --> 02:56.646
You burned down the garage?

02:56.646 --> 03:02.464
Well, between Frasier and his Bunsen burner and me and my mosquito repellent…in

03:02.464 --> 03:05.183
retrospect it was unavoidable!

03:05.183 --> 03:09.057
Still, you know Dad, I did have friends in college and back in Boston.

03:09.057 --> 03:11.922
It's only since I moved to Seattle that I've started falling back on Niles.

03:11.922 --> 03:15.230
Ooh ?"falling back on Niles"?

03:15.230 --> 03:18.855
Niles, you know what I mean. Settling for what's comfortable and familiar.

03:18.855 --> 03:22.485
My God, you and I can go out together and I know what you're thinking before you even say it.

03:22.485 --> 03:28.707
Well then I'm sorry you had to hear that Frasier!

03:28.707 --> 03:31.888
You know what? This would make a wonderful topic for my show.

03:31.888 --> 03:34.822
"Making New Friends" What are we so afraid of?

03:34.822 --> 03:36.704
Why do you make everything so complicated?

03:36.704 --> 03:40.919
You wanna meet somebody new? You just walk up to him, stick out your hand and say "Hi. How you doing?"

03:40.919 --> 03:44.491
Thank you Dad. I can always count on you not to overthink something.

03:44.491 --> 03:45.720
Thanks

03:45.720 --> 03:47.840
Hey!

03:50.251 --> 03:52.346
MAYBE JUST A SHAMPOO AND SET

03:52.346 --> 03:54.829
So why is it we have so much trouble making friends?

03:54.829 --> 03:57.179
Is it because we've become closed off?

03:57.179 --> 03:59.789
No longer want to reach out to our fellow man?

03:59.789 --> 04:04.605
Well I'd like to think that if one of you listeners out there happened to see me on the street
you'd feel free to walk right on up to me and?

04:04.605 --> 04:10.469
Excuse me Dr. Crane, we have to stop for a very important public service announcement

04:10.469 --> 04:13.625
HAVE YOU LOST YOUR MIND?

04:13.625 --> 04:16.249
You're opening yourself up to every creep out there!

04:16.249 --> 04:18.915
Oh Roz that's exactly the kind of cynicism I'm talking about.

04:18.915 --> 04:21.656
I, for one, happen to believe in the kindness of strangers.

04:21.656 --> 04:24.479
Well I believe in the strangeness of strangers!

04:24.479 --> 04:26.862
Three seconds.

04:26.862 --> 04:30.084
Hi, we're back with the topic of friendship.

04:30.084 --> 04:33.092
Now let's go to the switchboard. Roz, who's on line one?

04:33.092 --> 04:40.306
Good news Dr. Crane. It's Gerard from Stanwood. A new friend.

04:40.306 --> 04:42.412
Hello Gerard. I'm listening.

04:42.412 --> 04:45.324
Well I called for another reason Dr. Crane.

04:45.324 --> 04:50.454
But what you just said really moved me. I wish more people felt that way.

04:50.454 --> 04:54.498
Well thank you Gerard. I sense a kindred spirit.

04:54.498 --> 04:57.786
Maybe we could get together some time? Have a beer?

04:57.786 --> 05:07.992
Maybe I could…you know…comb your hair?

05:08.839 --> 05:11.933
Well thank you so much for your offer of friendship George but

05:11.933 --> 05:17.877
I really don't have five thousand dollars to invest in your French fries vending machine.

05:17.877 --> 05:25.274
And for the sake of those who do invest I suggest, Sir, that you find a better name than "The Spuddy Buddy".

05:25.274 --> 05:30.236
This is Dr. Frasier Crane wishing you all good mental health.

05:30.236 --> 05:33.574
I mean that today more than ever!

05:34.833 --> 05:38.518
I just love it when I'm right. It makes the day so good.

05:38.518 --> 05:39.717
You stacked the deck didn't you?

05:39.717 --> 05:43.980
Oh please. You should have heard some of the calls I didn't put through let alone these faxes.

05:43.980 --> 05:46.077
Read some of these. They're sick.

05:46.077 --> 05:51.893
Oh Roz my listeners are not sick?

05:51.893 --> 05:55.660
Although this one does bear watching!

05:56.629 --> 05:58.635
Here's one that has promise.

05:58.635 --> 06:00.951
"Dear Dr. Crane. I never thought I'd write a letter like this

06:00.951 --> 06:03.296
but I was moved by today's show.

06:03.296 --> 06:10.343
As a photographer I come into contact with new people on a daily basis
yet I often find it difficult to make that one on one connection.

06:10.343 --> 06:14.575
However your words offered hope and I just wanted to say thank you.

06:14.575 --> 06:16.989
Sincerely. Bob Reynolds."

06:16.989 --> 06:18.976
Doesn't sound too wacky.

06:18.976 --> 06:21.507
You know what? I think I'm going to give Mr. Bob Reynolds a call.

06:21.507 --> 06:22.890
Are you nuts?

06:22.890 --> 06:28.224
He could be a raving psychopath with a trunkful of decomposing squirrels.

06:28.224 --> 06:30.464
Oh rubbish Roz. I'm going to call him.

06:30.464 --> 06:33.260
Where did you come up with such a disgusting image?

06:33.260 --> 06:36.842
Meet Garth from Tacoma.

06:40.623 --> 06:43.986
BUTANE AND THE BEAST

06:43.986 --> 06:47.124
You're late today but I'm glad you're here. I need your help

06:47.124 --> 06:51.196
My designer is ready to mutiny if I don't pick a fabric for my new couch.

06:51.196 --> 06:54.038
Now I've brought lots of swatches so make yourself comfortable.

06:54.038 --> 06:58.977
Frankly Niles I'm not here to see you. I'm meeting a new friend.

06:58.977 --> 07:00.112
A new friend?

07:00.112 --> 07:04.815
Yes, you remember I was talking about widening my circle of friends.

07:04.815 --> 07:09.257
Oh I see. No more "falling back on Niles"

07:09.257 --> 07:13.398
It's not that I'm trying to replace you Niles. It's just that Bob and I?

07:13.398 --> 07:18.363
Bob? You're dumping me for someone named Bob?

07:18.363 --> 07:20.566
Niles I am not dumping you.

07:20.566 --> 07:23.787
I'm just worried that Bob might feel awkward meeting the two of us.

07:23.787 --> 07:27.956
Oh well we wouldn't want to make Bob feel uncomfortable now would we?

07:27.956 --> 07:32.111
I mean after all I've only been your brother for...38 years now.

07:32.111 --> 07:36.532
What does that mean when there's the possibility that Bob may feel awkward?

07:36.532 --> 07:38.678
There's a man over there who says he's waiting for you.

07:38.678 --> 07:42.038
No doubt the much ballyhooed Bob!

07:42.038 --> 07:43.174
Niles.

07:43.174 --> 07:45.274
Oh it's all right. It's all right. I'll go quietly.

07:45.274 --> 07:46.949
Don't worry about me. I'll be fine.

07:46.949 --> 07:48.132
I'll just go home to my Maris.

07:48.132 --> 07:53.087
Oh that's right!

07:55.280 --> 07:57.019
Bob?
Dr. Crane.

07:57.019 --> 07:58.505
No, please..Call me Frasier.

07:58.505 --> 08:00.815
Frasier then. I'm glad you called.

08:00.815 --> 08:05.466
Oh..yes..Coffee please. Well uh

08:05.466 --> 08:09.292
-So.
-So.

08:09.292 --> 08:12.114
So. Listen, thank you for your fax.

08:12.114 --> 08:15.563
I listen to your show all the time. I think you're brilliant.

08:15.563 --> 08:17.341
You're probably sick of hearing that though right?

08:17.341 --> 08:21.767
One would think but it's my cross.

08:21.767 --> 08:24.099
That's the thing I love about your show.

08:24.099 --> 08:26.595
You're not just serious. You can be funny.

08:26.595 --> 08:30.446
Well, I believe humour can be a therapeutic tool.

08:30.446 --> 08:34.739
Against the assault of laughter nothing can stand.

08:34.739 --> 08:38.230
Mark Twain. "The Mysterious Stranger". I have a first edition.

08:38.230 --> 08:39.716
I'm a collector myself.

08:39.716 --> 08:44.591
You know I was a bit trepidatious about this experiment Bob, but

08:44.591 --> 08:47.206
I'm feeling a real simpatico here.
Yeah, me too.

08:47.206 --> 08:51.837
I'm going to go out on a limb. What do you say once we finish these coffees we treat ourselves to a proper dinner?

08:51.837 --> 08:53.274
Hey that sounds great.

08:53.274 --> 08:56.171
OK. Say, what are you reading?

08:56.171 --> 09:01.823
It's my bible. "The Big Book of Barbecue" by Jeff Filgo.

09:01.823 --> 09:05.127
He's a Texan. Of course all Texans think they invented barbecue.

09:05.127 --> 09:07.960
Arrogant bastards!

09:07.960 --> 09:09.083
You like barbecue?

09:09.083 --> 09:15.288
Well…um…national holiday... 4th of July.

09:15.288 --> 09:17.769
You know the secret to good barbecue?

09:17.769 --> 09:19.649
Mesquite.

09:19.649 --> 09:23.930
And the secret to mesquite is you gotta soak them in water for 10 minutes.

09:23.930 --> 09:26.589
On special occasions I'll soak them in beer.

09:26.589 --> 09:30.353
Once I soaked them in Sake for that "flavour of the Far East".

09:30.353 --> 09:33.458
You know in Japan they call their barbecues "hibachis"?

09:33.458 --> 09:38.377
The arrogant bastards!

09:38.377 --> 09:40.634
I'm digging my own barbecue pit right now?

09:40.634 --> 09:43.201
…my speciality is the Shian Smoky Quail.

09:43.201 --> 09:46.557
The trick is a high engulfing flame. Like a forest fire.

09:46.557 --> 09:51.201
Of course they call forest fires "nature's barbecue".

09:51.201 --> 09:59.520
You know my co-workers call me "Shish-ka-Bob"?

09:59.520 --> 10:01.354
Well Bob.

10:01.354 --> 10:04.879
Do you have any charcoal free interests?

10:04.879 --> 10:06.863
Yeah I'm a professional photographer.

10:06.863 --> 10:08.434
The camera never lies.

10:08.434 --> 10:12.598
I'm a bit of a camera buff myself.
What's your trade? Photo journalist?

10:12.598 --> 10:19.491
I take kids portraits at Value-Mart Where your dollar buys more!

10:19.491 --> 10:23.627
You know what? Why don't we talk about this over dinner?

10:23.627 --> 10:25.570
Right..

10:28.127 --> 10:32.178
You know, Bob, about that dinner?

10:33.500 --> 10:36.696
How about Tex-Mex?

10:36.696 --> 10:41.187
You're talking my language.

10:49.249 --> 10:51.644
No you don't.

10:51.644 --> 10:58.179
I'm fixing you a breakfast drink with fresh fruit, yoghurt, carob, pitted prunes.

10:58.179 --> 11:00.893
A healthy body makes for a sunny disposition.

11:00.893 --> 11:05.469
You want sunny? Let me have my fritter.

11:05.469 --> 11:09.522
Oh shush.

11:11.551 --> 11:13.535
There we are.

11:13.535 --> 11:18.400
There just aren't enough drinks that build up a nice head of black foam!

11:21.087 --> 11:22.642
Morning.

11:22.642 --> 11:25.385
Well you were home late last night.

11:25.385 --> 11:27.696
I had dinner with a new friend. Bob.

11:27.696 --> 11:30.048
Oh that's right. Have a good time?

11:30.048 --> 11:34.375
Hardly. The man talks endlessly on subjects that are of no interest to anyone but him.

11:34.375 --> 11:39.484
Gee. I can't imagine what that's like.

11:41.233 --> 11:43.956
Oh Dad. He took me to this God-awful barbecue place.

11:43.956 --> 11:48.028
All they serve is huge platters of charred greasy beef.

11:48.028 --> 11:56.237
The only sound you can hear is the gnawing of meat, the smacking of lips and the clatter of bones hitting the floor.

11:56.237 --> 11:59.892
I can't take it any more. I'm having that fritter!

12:01.849 --> 12:04.618
If you don't like this man why did you have dinner with him?

12:04.618 --> 12:07.457
Well I was going to tell him that I didn't want to see him anymore but

12:07.457 --> 12:11.794
you see it's a bit more delicate than just that.

12:11.794 --> 12:15.862
The problem is he's in a wheel chair.

12:15.862 --> 12:19.029
So what? If you don't like him you don't like him.

12:19.029 --> 12:23.885
Well I know that. It's just that I'd hate to have him think it was just because of the chair.

12:23.885 --> 12:26.921
I have worked with the disabled for over 10 years now.

12:26.921 --> 12:31.748
And if it's one thing I've learned they don't want special treatment.

12:31.748 --> 12:33.766
Oh I forgot to bring in the paper.

12:33.766 --> 12:39.014
Daphne would you get it? My leg's just aching and throbbing!

12:40.807 --> 12:42.988
I'll get it.

12:42.988 --> 12:45.690
You know, Daphne, you're right?

12:45.690 --> 12:47.881
I was kind of a coward wasn't I?

12:47.881 --> 12:51.346
Well, at least I got through the evening.

12:51.346 --> 12:54.034
Here's your paper Buddy!

12:57.451 --> 13:00.584
Bob you're here. Did we have plans?

13:00.584 --> 13:03.840
No. I was in the neighbourhood. Just thought I'd stop by.

13:03.840 --> 13:09.942
Did I mention where I lived? I'm astonishingly sure I didn't.

13:09.942 --> 13:13.205
You'd be amazed what you can find out with computers today.

13:13.205 --> 13:19.412
Anyway ?brought bagels, poppy seeds, pumpernickel, rye, sesame, onion, garlic.

13:19.412 --> 13:23.523
'Cos after all breakfast is the most important meal of the day.

13:23.523 --> 13:25.382
Hey-ho you must be Martin.

13:25.382 --> 13:27.222
You're Daphne.
That's right.

13:27.222 --> 13:28.496
And you must be Bob.

13:28.496 --> 13:34.221
That's me. Bob! Same forwards as backwards.

13:37.212 --> 13:40.145
THE SQUEAKY WHEEL GIVES THE GRIEF

13:40.145 --> 13:42.102
Got some messages.

13:42.102 --> 13:43.852
Bob. Bob.

13:43.852 --> 13:48.751
And…oh look…here's one from Bob.

13:48.751 --> 13:52.543
2 weeks and 45 phone calls.

13:52.543 --> 13:54.906
Can't we just get an unlisted number?

13:54.906 --> 13:58.132
They sort of frown on that with call-in shows.

13:58.132 --> 14:00.912
Frasier you've got to do something about Bob.

14:00.912 --> 14:04.501
I know Roz. I'm working up to it.

14:04.501 --> 14:07.470
You know the longer you put it off the worse he's going to feel when you finally tell him.

14:07.470 --> 14:10.338
Yes I know that. I'm a psychiatrist.

14:10.338 --> 14:15.261
I'm quite capable of dealing with difficult problems in a sensitive mature fashion?

14:15.261 --> 14:17.580
…Wait!

14:17.580 --> 14:19.650
Did you hear that?

14:19.650 --> 14:21.053
That squeak!

14:21.053 --> 14:22.481
What squeak?

14:22.481 --> 14:25.677
He's here. It's Bob!

14:25.677 --> 14:26.806
I don't hear anything.

14:26.806 --> 14:31.664
Oh that's right. Only dogs and I can hear it.

14:31.664 --> 14:35.048
Frasier, you're being paranoid.

14:35.048 --> 14:39.076
It's the sound of his chair. I'd know it anywhere.

14:40.217 --> 14:42.524
Oh..my god!

14:48.198 --> 14:49.182
Hi Bob.

14:49.182 --> 14:51.279
Knock Knock Roz. Frasier around?

14:51.214 --> 14:52.306
You just missed him.

14:52.306 --> 14:53.700
Too bad. I got great news.

14:53.700 --> 15:02.677
I checked out that vacancy in his apartment building and guess who's gonna be neighbours?

15:02.677 --> 15:03.706
What was that?

15:03.706 --> 15:09.131
Feedback. This equipment's old and pathetic!

15:09.131 --> 15:14.873
Well maybe I can catch Frasier back at his place…correction, our place.

15:14.873 --> 15:18.336
Bye Bob.
Bye Roz.

15:21.685 --> 15:23.794
OK he's gone. You can come out now.

15:23.794 --> 15:27.987
No he's not. He's never really gone!

15:27.987 --> 15:29.936
So Bob's gonna be your new neighbour?

15:29.936 --> 15:34.274
Well, break out the butane there every Barbecue day!

15:34.274 --> 15:37.816
NO! NO! He's not going to move into my building.

15:37.816 --> 15:39.744
I won't allow it. I'm going to talk to him Roz.

15:39.744 --> 15:42.184
Listen, I could use your advice. You've broken up with a lot of people.

15:42.184 --> 15:44.495
What do you find to be the most effective thing to say?

15:44.495 --> 15:48.780
I love you and I want to have your baby.

15:48.780 --> 15:51.518
Good, I've got my fallback.

15:54.724 --> 15:56.569
Ooh Niles, Niles. I need to talk.

15:56.569 --> 15:58.180
Bob's meeting me here?

15:58.180 --> 15:59.487
This isn't my usual.

15:59.487 --> 16:03.196
Well it's not for you. It's for my friend.

16:04.879 --> 16:06.042
That man is your friend?

16:06.042 --> 16:10.597
Yep. We share thoughts, feelings. We talk about the arts, current events.

16:10.597 --> 16:13.549
Today we're just…hangin'!

16:17.320 --> 16:18.723
There you are.
Thanks.

16:18.723 --> 16:20.354
My pleasure.

16:20.354 --> 16:22.941
You know, I can't stay long.

16:22.941 --> 16:28.115
I've got 4 more pools to clean today besides yours and I'm gonna to lose sunlight.

16:28.115 --> 16:34.467
You know, Ralph, I was thinking that in many ways my profession is a lot like yours.

16:34.467 --> 16:37.832
I start out skimming the surface of the human psyche.

16:37.832 --> 16:48.060
Then I plunge ever deeper into the murky undercurrents, adding chemicals when necessary.

16:48.060 --> 16:51.424
…There's a lot of leaves this year!

16:53.478 --> 16:56.862
I'm glad you called. I was starting to get self-conscious here.

16:56.862 --> 17:03.095
It seems like I'm always the one calling or stopping by or suggesting dinner or movies or shopping for hats.

17:03.095 --> 17:07.801
Oh I got you a beaut!

17:08.473 --> 17:10.569
Bob. You really shouldn't have.

17:10.569 --> 17:13.992
I knew you'd like it, neighbour.

17:13.992 --> 17:17.226
About that Bob. Have you actually signed a lease yet?

17:17.226 --> 17:19.608
No. Why?

17:19.608 --> 17:21.935
Well, we need to talk.

17:21.935 --> 17:27.201
Whoa. If you were a woman I'd swear you were dumping me.

17:28.111 --> 17:29.300
Blue one's nice.

17:29.300 --> 17:33.805
Mmm. I'm just concerned that blue might be a bit overbearing on a couch of that size.

17:33.805 --> 17:38.033
Although it might complement that Killin rug I was telling you about. What do you think?

17:38.033 --> 17:43.039
I live in my van!

17:43.039 --> 17:48.222
So you'd probably go for colours that add the illusion of space?

17:48.222 --> 17:50.450
You know, Dr. Crane to be perfectly honest,

17:50.450 --> 17:56.944
when you asked if I wanted coffee ?I thought you were gonna bring me one.

17:56.944 --> 18:03.695
Duly noted Ralph. Next week you can go back to drinking from the hose.

18:04.755 --> 18:12.163
You see I just don't think there's a basis between us for a sound friendship.

18:12.163 --> 18:14.342
Neither of us should feel bad about it.

18:14.342 --> 18:17.237
That's easy for you to say. You're not the one being rejected.

18:17.237 --> 18:19.932
No, no. I'm not rejecting you.

18:19.932 --> 18:23.177
Truth is you're pleasant. You're charming.

18:23.177 --> 18:24.931
Frasier, I'm an adult here.

18:24.931 --> 18:29.101
At least respect me enough to tell me what it is you don't like about me.

18:29.101 --> 18:30.787
Well all right, all right.

18:30.787 --> 18:32.465
We have absolutely nothing in common.

18:32.465 --> 18:36.561
You talk on endlessly about subjects that I have no interest in.

18:36.561 --> 18:41.394
You call me all the time. Frankly you're suffocating me!

18:41.394 --> 18:46.922
Wow. I don't know what to say.

18:46.922 --> 18:49.024
I wish you'd said something sooner.

18:49.024 --> 18:56.274
I wanted to. Frankly I was afraid you'd think it was because of the…you know?

18:56.274 --> 18:58.305
The what?

18:58.305 --> 19:00.697
The wheelchair.

19:00.697 --> 19:02.034
Why would I think that?

19:02.034 --> 19:05.918
I don't know. I just wanted you to know that.

19:05.918 --> 19:08.254
I wish it did have to do with the chair.

19:08.254 --> 19:09.505
I beg your pardon.

19:09.505 --> 19:14.456
Well, if the chair were your problem that would make you a jerk.

19:14.456 --> 19:15.764
This way, I'm the jerk.

19:15.764 --> 19:17.524
Well, I wouldn't say that.

19:17.524 --> 19:21.123
Come on, you just did. You just said I'm boring and obnoxious.

19:21.123 --> 19:24.983
Who knows people better than you?

19:24.983 --> 19:28.590
You can keep the hat.

19:29.808 --> 19:34.076
Bob, wait,

19:34.076 --> 19:38.742
please. I've got to level with you.

19:38.742 --> 19:44.334
Truth is I find nothing wrong with you.

19:44.334 --> 19:48.218
I was just ashamed to admit it.

19:48.218 --> 19:50.817
It is the chair.

19:50.817 --> 19:52.644
What?

19:52.644 --> 19:55.953
I think frankly that you are wonderful company.

19:55.953 --> 20:00.052
Wildly stimulating. Your hobbies are so fascinating.

20:00.052 --> 20:05.967
You have a sense of style that really, I mean, doesn't compare to anyone's.

20:05.967 --> 20:11.778
It's just me. I feel petty and small about it but

20:11.778 --> 20:15.724
I can't get past the chair. I'm sorry Bob. Please.

20:15.724 --> 20:17.723
I'm sorry. This is goodbye.

20:17.723 --> 20:19.515
I don't believe this.

20:19.515 --> 20:21.981
You don't want to be my friend 'cos I'm in a wheelchair.

20:21.981 --> 20:24.028
What?

20:24.028 --> 20:26.578
That's the worst thing I've ever heard!

20:26.578 --> 20:28.241
Look. You don't understand.

20:28.241 --> 20:32.739
What's not to understand. You just said flat out ?my chair repulses you

20:32.739 --> 20:34.536
What kind of a person does that?

20:34.536 --> 20:39.319
I've got a birthmark on my back. I guess we can't be friends either!

20:39.319 --> 20:42.247
People please. Frankly this doesn't concern any of you.

20:42.247 --> 20:45.157
When I think about all the gifts I gave you.

20:45.157 --> 20:51.562
All the barbecue sauce ?Hot 'n' Spicy, Tex Mex, Mesquite, Teriyaki, Honey Mustard?

20:51.562 --> 20:56.004
Oh For God's sake Bob ?put a sock in it.

20:56.004 --> 20:58.677
We were just on our way to dinner. Would you like to join us?

20:58.677 --> 21:01.008
I'd love to.

21:02.504 --> 21:04.713
So. You guys like barbecue?

21:04.713 --> 21:07.273
Yeah. Who doesn't?

21:36.819 --> 21:40.765
Are these wing tips too busy with these pants?

21:41.340 --> 21:45.460
Well, yes. They're a bit frenzied. Perhaps a woven lace would tone down the glitz.

21:45.460 --> 21:46.968
Might have to go overseas for that.

21:46.968 --> 21:48.727
No, not at all. You can get them downtown.

21:48.727 --> 21:50.047
Well, who shops downtown anymore?

21:50.047 --> 21:51.274
Well I do for one?
