-We are having sex.

Oh, you mean up the...

00:22.440 --> 00:24.640

00:34.680 --> 00:35.640
What are you doing?

00:37.640 --> 00:39.600
Waiting for you to... put it in.

00:40.120 --> 00:41.800
Oh, did you already douche?

00:41.880 --> 00:44.720
I mean, unless you're cool with it
maybe being a bit messy.

00:44.800 --> 00:45.800
Uh, no.

00:45.880 --> 00:48.480
Of course I already douched.

00:49.200 --> 00:50.640
'Cause I like to be clean.

00:51.760 --> 00:53.560
Speaking of clean, I...

00:54.320 --> 00:56.080
I'm gonna go wash my hands.

00:56.960 --> 00:58.200
'Cause that's how clean I am.

01:15.640 --> 01:17.560
Sorry, I should... Hello.

01:18.120 --> 01:19.160
Help!

01:19.760 --> 01:21.320
I've been mugged.

01:21.640 --> 01:23.840
Come now. It's an emergency.

01:26.440 --> 01:30.520
Hold on. Wait. No, slow down.
Don't move, I'll be right there.

01:31.320 --> 01:33.200
So, Olivia's been mugged.

01:34.200 --> 01:35.880
Sorry. I've gotta go.

01:36.880 --> 01:37.720
Rain check?

01:38.880 --> 01:40.680
Yeah, of course. I hope she's okay.

01:42.240 --> 01:43.200
You know,

01:44.320 --> 01:47.200
people think you're mean,
but you're actually so sweet.

01:47.280 --> 01:49.600
Okay, thanks. All right, see you, bye.

-Yeah?

02:47.560 --> 02:48.720
-Yeah.
-All good?

02:48.800 --> 02:49.920
-Thank you.
-Perfect.

02:51.080 --> 02:52.400
Oh, you're a twat.

03:06.920 --> 03:08.040
It's looking good.

03:08.360 --> 03:10.680
So when can he get back to training?

03:11.720 --> 03:14.600
Shouldn't I wait, Mum?
It's literally just come off.

03:14.680 --> 03:17.000
You'll be fine. Take it slow, obviously,

03:17.080 --> 03:19.000
but it's important
to build your strength up.

03:19.240 --> 03:20.760
You can start training again this week.

03:21.840 --> 03:23.080
Maybe tomorrow evening?

03:26.320 --> 03:28.640
-Thanks for taking her, Cynthia.
-That's all right, love.

03:28.720 --> 03:30.720
Jonathan's always wanted a sibling.

03:31.800 --> 03:35.560
Your mum's holding down that job then?
Wonders never cease.

03:36.200 --> 03:37.760
Yeah, she's enjoying it, I think.

03:39.160 --> 03:40.000
Okay.

03:40.080 --> 03:42.040
See you later. Be good.

03:44.160 --> 03:45.480
-Bye.
-Bye.

03:46.120 --> 03:48.240
Do you want to hang out later?

03:48.640 --> 03:49.840
I've got plans.

03:49.920 --> 03:52.520
-Ooh, and what are your plans?
-Haven't decided yet.

03:53.360 --> 03:55.920
Great. I'm looking forward
to hanging out later then.

04:00.120 --> 04:03.120
Oh, I still can't believe
she called me "uptight."

04:03.200 --> 04:05.920
-Seriously.
-Well, you do over-analyze stuff.

04:06.000 --> 04:08.680
-Oh! Oh, so you agree with her?
-No! No!

04:09.640 --> 04:12.280
Well, you are a bit rigid at times,
don't you think?

04:12.360 --> 04:14.040
I'm not rigid. I am...

04:14.720 --> 04:16.160
I'm totally chill.

04:16.240 --> 04:18.840
-Okay.
-In fact, I'm going to show you both

04:18.920 --> 04:20.000
just how chill I am.

04:20.560 --> 04:23.360
I'm going to have a small gathering
of friends at my house tonight.

04:23.440 --> 04:25.520
-A party?
-No, a small gathering.

04:25.600 --> 04:27.800
And I'm gonna cook a roast chicken.

04:27.880 --> 04:31.600
Don't cook a roast chicken.
Cooking a roast chicken is not chill.

04:31.680 --> 04:34.640
Okay? Who are you going to invite?
You don't have any friends.

04:34.720 --> 04:36.000
-Yes, I do.
-Who?

04:36.640 --> 04:38.240
I have you and...

04:39.320 --> 04:41.040
-Lily.
-Lily? Is Lily your friend?

04:41.120 --> 04:43.320
Yes, she is. I helped her vagina open up.

04:43.400 --> 04:47.080
-But don't repeat that, it's confidential.
-Clients are not friends, Otis.

04:47.160 --> 04:50.520
Fine. You invite Rahim
and some of your Swing Band friends.

04:50.600 --> 04:54.800
I'll invite you and Lily, and we can have
a totally spontaneous,

04:54.880 --> 04:58.000
super-small, chill gathering
at my house tonight.

04:58.080 --> 04:58.960
Without a chicken?

04:59.920 --> 05:01.120
Without a chicken.

05:09.440 --> 05:12.240
Hey, Lily. How are you doing?

05:12.320 --> 05:14.840
I have to be somewhere else.

05:21.760 --> 05:23.440
Otis, you can't be mad at both of them.

05:23.520 --> 05:26.040
I can. Maeve ruined my relationship,

05:26.120 --> 05:29.680
-and Ola broke up with me, so--
-Uh, that's a little extreme.

05:29.760 --> 05:33.000
-You should invite Maeve to your party.
-No, it's a small gathering.

05:33.080 --> 05:36.160
Uh, you can have a couple of drinks,
clear the air. I know you want to.

05:36.240 --> 05:38.680
-I do not want her there.

05:46.800 --> 05:48.760
I feel bad about Maeve.

05:49.960 --> 05:52.480
We spoke about this, Steve.
She was too much of a risk

05:52.560 --> 05:55.560
and she doesn't take this seriously.
At least Paulina is reliable.

05:55.640 --> 05:56.800
I can hear you.

05:58.520 --> 06:01.280
Hey, Viv. I loved that meme
you sent me last night.

06:01.360 --> 06:03.840
-It was hilarious.
-I know. Cats playing Scrabble,

06:03.920 --> 06:04.960
gets me every time.

06:07.960 --> 06:08.920
Polly.

06:10.560 --> 06:11.960
Prawn cocktail?

06:13.040 --> 06:14.320
No.

06:14.400 --> 06:16.880
I can't deal with the smell of fish
before lunch.

06:19.680 --> 06:22.000
-Anyway, how long until the heat?
-Um...

06:22.640 --> 06:26.200
We have 25 minutes of free time
before the minibus leaves.

06:26.840 --> 06:30.360
-Great. I might go and do some push-ups.
-Okay. I'll get on with some practice.

06:34.960 --> 06:36.840
I am going to go to the bathroom.

06:43.680 --> 06:45.360
Polly, I can smell it from here.

06:51.480 --> 06:53.040
<i>Party at Otis Milburn's tonight.</i>

06:53.120 --> 06:55.480
Okay. Party at Otis Milburn's tonight.

06:55.560 --> 06:57.600
-But it's a Thursday.
-BYO booze.

06:57.680 --> 06:59.680
We can't be hungover at rehearsals.

07:06.880 --> 07:09.600
Hi. Um, party at Otis Milburn's tonight.

07:10.320 --> 07:11.600
It's a Thursday.

07:12.320 --> 07:16.120
-Thursday's the new Friday.
-No, Wednesday is the new Saturday.

07:16.200 --> 07:18.680
-Everybody knows that.
-Can I come to the party?

07:18.760 --> 07:20.360
No, Rahim. I've disgraced us.

07:20.440 --> 07:24.280
I didn't realize you were going, Rahim.
Uh, where's Otis's house then?

07:24.360 --> 07:25.960
Uh, 43 Ashford Street.

07:26.560 --> 07:27.800
BYO booze.

07:31.280 --> 07:32.840
Bye. Your hair is majestic.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.960
You're not actually going
to a party on a Thursday, are you?

07:37.680 --> 07:40.320
Thursdays are the new Fridays, Olivia.
Get with the program.

07:53.600 --> 07:55.040
My boyfriend wants to have anal sex.

07:55.120 --> 07:58.040
I told him I've done it before,
but I haven't, and I'm freaking out.

07:59.240 --> 08:00.480
Okay, well, um...

08:00.960 --> 08:02.680
what exactly are you afraid of?

08:04.040 --> 08:05.360
I don't know how to douche.

08:05.760 --> 08:08.240
I've looked it up online.
Every website says something different.

08:08.320 --> 08:09.600
Listen to me,

08:09.680 --> 08:12.680
I cannot, under any circumstances,
shit myself.

08:13.080 --> 08:15.600
Let me do some research,
and I'll get back to you.

08:16.360 --> 08:20.080
Also, I'm having a small gathering
of friends at my house tonight,

08:20.160 --> 08:22.560
-if you'd like to come--
-What the fuck's a "small gathering"?

08:22.640 --> 08:26.160
It's... a small group--

08:26.240 --> 08:28.040
-Be quick with the research, yeah?
- Hey.

08:28.120 --> 08:29.240
Hey, guys. Um...

08:30.040 --> 08:31.920
-weird question.
-Uh-huh.

08:32.000 --> 08:34.240
What do you know about anal douching?

08:34.320 --> 08:36.520
Um, not much to be honest, Otis.

08:36.600 --> 08:38.840
I know about this, I'll teach you.

08:42.480 --> 08:43.720
-Hi, Claire.

09:18.440 --> 09:19.560

Paulina's got food poisoning,

09:34.800 --> 09:37.920
-and she wasn't very good anyway.
-It's true, you were so much better.

09:38.000 --> 09:40.040
She always said "pacific"
instead of "specific,"

09:40.120 --> 09:42.120
and didn't know
marsupials have pouches.

09:43.800 --> 09:47.680
Okay, fine. Please will you come back?
But you can't go rogue, okay?

09:52.920 --> 09:54.080
Jean speaking.

09:54.160 --> 09:56.960
<i>Hello, Jean.</i>
<i>It's Michelle Lawson, Remi's agent.</i>

09:57.040 --> 09:59.560
<i>-Long time no speak.</i>
-Hello, Michelle.

09:59.640 --> 10:01.880
<i>I'm calling because</i>
<i>Remi mentioned the possibility</i>

10:01.960 --> 10:03.520
<i>of you two writing together again.</i>

10:03.600 --> 10:06.680
<i>Something about teenagers</i>
<i>and sex education in schools?</i>

10:06.760 --> 10:07.800
<i>Sounds fascinating.</i>

10:07.880 --> 10:14.280
Well, firstly, my research is confidential
and secondly, Remi is grossly mistaken.

10:14.360 --> 10:16.520
I will not be writing with him again.

10:16.600 --> 10:18.120
<i>Oh, why not?</i>

10:18.680 --> 10:21.200
Because he is a colossal twat.

10:23.920 --> 10:25.920
-Oh, hello, Ola.
-Hi.

10:27.760 --> 10:28.840
Have a seat.

10:34.720 --> 10:37.600
So, Dad told me
you guys aren't seeing each other anymore.

10:38.640 --> 10:39.560
Well, at least...

10:40.280 --> 10:42.640
it might make it easier
for you and Otis now.

10:43.320 --> 10:45.640
Oh, we broke up too.

10:46.320 --> 10:48.760
Oh, I'm so sorry.

10:48.840 --> 10:49.960
He didn't tell you?

10:50.040 --> 10:52.680
Well, he doesn't tell me much
these days, and...

10:54.240 --> 10:58.200
Well, sometimes I wonder if
it would've been easier if I'd had a girl.

10:58.280 --> 11:00.280
Girls can be pretty annoying too.

11:07.920 --> 11:10.640
You know, if you ever need
to talk to a woman about anything...

11:17.080 --> 11:19.800
What would you do
if you really liked someone,

11:19.880 --> 11:21.920
and you were so sure they liked you too,

11:23.240 --> 11:26.240
but all of a sudden they're acting like
they find you completely revolting?

11:28.480 --> 11:30.760
Douching is not essential

11:30.840 --> 11:33.520
if you eat a lot of fiber
and empty your bowels regularly.

11:34.280 --> 11:35.120
-Huh.
-Hmm.

11:35.200 --> 11:37.440
If you've never douched before,
it might be best

11:37.520 --> 11:39.960
to start with a simple bulb, like that.

11:40.040 --> 11:41.760
So, water in the bulb...

11:41.840 --> 11:45.040
If I'm not cooking a roast chicken,
what are people going to eat?

11:45.600 --> 11:46.720
Crisps.

11:47.160 --> 11:49.600
Otis, just crisps.

11:49.680 --> 11:52.560
...for as long as you can,
sit on the toilet...

11:54.920 --> 11:56.000
and release.

11:56.080 --> 11:58.000
-What about dips?
-No dips.

11:58.080 --> 12:01.000
-But my guac is--
-Just listen to Rahim.

12:01.080 --> 12:02.880
...and protective mucus in your anus.

12:05.640 --> 12:07.160
-Boys!
-Hey!

12:07.640 --> 12:08.760
Let's see the hand.

12:09.560 --> 12:11.640
-Glad to have you back, Marchetti.
-Cheers, man.

12:12.480 --> 12:13.440
Sir,

12:13.920 --> 12:17.000
my cast came off this morning
and I'm back training this week.

12:17.080 --> 12:18.680
Amazing news. Congratulations.

12:18.760 --> 12:21.400
So, I'm not gonna be able
to make dress rehearsals tomorrow night.

12:22.040 --> 12:25.520
Jackson, this is show business, all right?

12:25.600 --> 12:28.560
Not no-show business.
Just rearrange training.

12:28.640 --> 12:32.040
It's my mum, sir. She wants me
back in the pool as soon as possible.

12:32.120 --> 12:34.920
I'm sure she'll understand.
It's great to have more than one passion.

12:35.000 --> 12:36.360
Talk to her, okay?

12:40.640 --> 12:44.320
Squat, don't rush,
push it in, compress the bulb.

12:44.400 --> 12:45.920
-Pull to take it out.

12:47.640 --> 12:48.640
What's going on?

12:49.120 --> 12:51.200
I'm teaching Otis how to douche.

12:52.240 --> 12:55.640
-But we're leaving, actually.
-Yeah. Yeah, sorry.

12:58.240 --> 12:59.800
Okay.

12:59.880 --> 13:01.160
Thank you.

13:10.040 --> 13:11.960
Squeeze, hold, release.

13:12.560 --> 13:15.560
-I'll pick you up at your house.
-I can meet you at the party.

13:15.640 --> 13:18.200
-Small gathering.
-Yeah, but I wanna see where you live.

13:18.560 --> 13:20.080
Okay.

13:23.600 --> 13:24.760
What's the matter?

13:25.320 --> 13:28.040
I've just never had anyone
meet my family before.

13:30.200 --> 13:31.920
I still think that you should invite her.

13:32.880 --> 13:33.720
No.

13:33.800 --> 13:35.080
-What--
-No. I'll see you later.

13:35.160 --> 13:37.760
I don't want to see any roast chicken!

13:43.400 --> 13:44.800
Hey, Maeve.

13:45.320 --> 13:48.520
Um, I think you should come
to Otis's party tonight.

13:48.600 --> 13:51.560
-I didn't get an invite.
-But I know he wants you there.

13:51.640 --> 13:53.800
-I think that you two really need to talk.

13:55.240 --> 13:57.360
He didn't mean what he said in the text.

13:58.520 --> 14:00.760
Please? Just talk to him.

14:02.400 --> 14:04.000
I'll think about it, okay?

14:04.480 --> 14:05.360
Okay.

14:15.080 --> 14:16.680
See you later. Bye.

14:21.400 --> 14:22.520
Okay.

14:24.400 --> 14:25.920
What are you...

14:33.320 --> 14:36.840
Okay, what are you doing, Mum?
What are you doing?

14:39.720 --> 14:40.560
Ooh!

14:41.280 --> 14:42.320
-Otis.
-Mum.

14:42.400 --> 14:44.600
-Are you okay?
-Yeah. I'm just, uh...

14:45.120 --> 14:46.960
-I was waiting for you to get back.
-Oh.

14:47.400 --> 14:50.800
I'm thinking of having
some friends over tonight.

14:51.240 --> 14:52.200
Oh.

14:52.520 --> 14:53.920
-A party?
-No.

14:54.000 --> 14:55.200
Just a gathering.

14:55.840 --> 15:00.680
Um... But I was thinking
maybe if you could not be there?

15:00.760 --> 15:03.480
Oh. Oh, I see. Uh, yeah.

15:03.920 --> 15:05.440
It's not personal.

15:05.520 --> 15:06.720
-No.
-It's just--

15:06.800 --> 15:07.960
-Of course not.
-You know?

15:08.720 --> 15:13.360
You're asserting your independence
from your primary care giver.

15:13.440 --> 15:14.720
It's perfectly normal.

15:15.320 --> 15:17.240
I will make myself scarce.

15:20.240 --> 15:21.880
-Otis?
-Yeah?

15:24.360 --> 15:26.520
You know you can talk to me
about anything?

15:30.800 --> 15:31.720
Yeah, I know.

15:31.800 --> 15:36.320
<i>♪ Betrayal takes two</i>
<i>Who did it to who? ♪</i>

15:36.400 --> 15:38.040
-Bye, darling.
-See ya.

15:38.120 --> 15:44.360
<i>♪ I mean, not to be cut</i>
<i>By your dull point of view ♪</i>

15:44.440 --> 15:47.920
<i>♪ Well, feelings will change  ♪</i>

15:51.040 --> 15:56.760

16:23.240 --> 16:24.640
What are you doing tonight?

16:25.200 --> 16:28.840
Remember, whoever wins this heat
gets a place in the televised finals,

16:28.920 --> 16:31.640
where all your friends, families,
and university recruiters

16:31.720 --> 16:34.760
will get a chance to see your giant brains
in widescreen high definition.

16:34.840 --> 16:37.800
Maeve, you are not a lone wolf.
We play as a team today.

16:37.880 --> 16:39.080
A winning team.

16:39.680 --> 16:40.520
Okay.

16:44.400 --> 16:47.200
I talked to Coach earlier.
They said there's every chance

16:47.280 --> 16:49.280
you could be back on track
for the Nationals.

16:49.800 --> 16:51.800
Obviously, we'll take it slowly, but...

16:52.200 --> 16:55.280
Well, maybe Jackson doesn't want
to talk about swimming right now.

16:55.360 --> 16:57.000
You mean <i>you </i>don't want to talk about it.

16:57.080 --> 16:59.360
Uh, that's not what I said.

16:59.440 --> 17:02.560
-It's what you're implying.
-Everything's fine, okay? I'm fine,

17:02.640 --> 17:05.720
the hand's fine, everything is fine.
Let's just drop it, okay?

17:11.400 --> 17:12.680
I'll get it.

17:15.840 --> 17:17.800
Lovely to meet you, Mrs. Effiong.

17:17.880 --> 17:19.320
- Ooh.

17:19.840 --> 17:22.840
-Eric, who is your friend?
-I'm Eric's boyfriend.

17:23.520 --> 17:24.840
Oh.

17:24.920 --> 17:27.040
-Lovely to meet you...
-Rahim.

17:27.120 --> 17:28.200
Rahim.

17:28.760 --> 17:31.000
Eric, why didn't you say
you had a boyfriend?

17:31.080 --> 17:34.520
-Would you like to come in--
-No, no, no! Mum, we're in a rush,

17:34.600 --> 17:36.000
and we need to go now.

17:37.720 --> 17:40.600
Don't be late. It's a Thursday.

17:42.480 --> 17:45.880
-Your family know you're gay, right?
-Yeah.

17:45.960 --> 17:47.280
I came out when I was 13.

17:47.360 --> 17:49.320
So, why don't you tell your parents
about me then?

17:49.400 --> 17:52.120
Well, we're just
not a very talkative family.

17:53.720 --> 17:55.800
Come on. We're gonna be late.

17:56.280 --> 17:58.200
-We're gonna be late?
-Yeah, we're gonna be late.

17:58.280 --> 17:59.320
-Yeah.
-Yeah, late.

18:00.400 --> 18:03.040
Last question,
and for a place in the final,

18:03.120 --> 18:05.160
according to the Department of Health,

18:05.240 --> 18:07.400
what is the most common drug
used in the UK?

18:07.480 --> 18:09.080
-Ibuprofen.

18:09.960 --> 18:11.120
-Incorrect.

18:11.200 --> 18:12.120
Fuck.

18:12.200 --> 18:13.760
Quiz Heads, over to you.

18:16.680 --> 18:17.920
I think it's marijuana.

18:18.000 --> 18:20.680
It's not a legal drug.
It's paracetamol, trust me.

18:21.680 --> 18:23.080
Weed.

18:28.880 --> 18:29.840
The answer is...

18:31.240 --> 18:32.240
paracetamol.

18:34.600 --> 18:37.680
And the Moordale Quiz Heads
are through to the final.

18:41.280 --> 18:43.760
-Yes! Get in!
-Come on!

18:44.280 --> 18:45.280
Well done.

18:45.360 --> 18:47.480
I definitely would have said weed.

18:48.720 --> 18:50.640
Have you ever done magic mushrooms?

18:50.720 --> 18:52.600
I'm not sure I should answer that.

19:02.000 --> 19:04.880
When the others arrive,
I'll put out the rest of the snacks.

19:05.040 --> 19:06.600
Maybe we can play some charades.

19:11.920 --> 19:13.560
So, did Eric invite you?

19:14.280 --> 19:16.800
I heard there was a big party
at your house.

19:16.920 --> 19:19.240
I thought I might get to hang out
with your mum.

19:21.800 --> 19:22.800
Oh, God.

19:29.240 --> 19:31.040
That must be Eric.

19:31.120 --> 19:32.880
I told him to bring a cheese board.

19:36.520 --> 19:38.240
- Hi, Debbie. Hi.
-You all right?

19:38.320 --> 19:40.200
Oh, yeah. Okay, um...

19:46.640 --> 19:47.560
Oh, um...

19:47.640 --> 19:48.800
Excuse me, um...

19:49.560 --> 19:51.360
What? Oh, God!

20:01.360 --> 20:02.480
I can't believe it.

20:05.480 --> 20:06.840
Who's gonna be there?

20:08.040 --> 20:09.640
Well, I hope Jamie and Joel.

20:10.720 --> 20:13.600
-Who even told you about Otis's party?
-Trom-boner.

20:16.760 --> 20:17.720
Adam?

20:18.160 --> 20:19.640
Didn't you get expelled?

20:21.200 --> 20:24.120
I heard he has a huge dick.

20:28.160 --> 20:29.120
Thanks, Adam.

20:40.440 --> 20:42.320
-Hi, my babies.
-Hi, Mum.

20:46.560 --> 20:47.880
You been crying?

20:48.920 --> 20:49.840
Huh?

20:50.760 --> 20:52.200
Allergies.

20:55.080 --> 20:57.640
These bloody plants
are trying to kill me, I think.

21:00.040 --> 21:01.600
Good job they're pretty, eh?

21:03.720 --> 21:04.800
How was school?

21:05.280 --> 21:08.720
I got back on the quiz team.
And we're going to the finals.

21:08.800 --> 21:09.640
Oh.

21:10.200 --> 21:12.520
And I have two tickets for family.

21:13.400 --> 21:15.440
And it would mean a lot
if you could be there.

21:16.120 --> 21:18.520
-Yeah, of course I'll be there.
-Cool.

21:19.560 --> 21:21.080
Why are you all dressed up?

21:22.320 --> 21:23.520
I'm going to a party.

21:24.120 --> 21:25.160
Who's the boy then?

21:25.240 --> 21:26.440
No, there's no boy, Mum.

21:27.240 --> 21:28.800
-I'll see you later.
-What's his name?

21:28.880 --> 21:30.840
Stop it! There's no boy.

21:33.280 --> 21:35.200
-Bye, Els.
- Mmm.

21:35.280 --> 21:36.200
Stop!

21:38.000 --> 21:38.840
Bye.

21:41.040 --> 21:43.520
-I thought you were busy tonight.
-I am.

21:43.600 --> 21:46.040
-I'm going to a party.
-Can I come?

21:46.120 --> 21:47.040
No.

21:47.240 --> 21:50.240
You don't know what you're missing.
I'm really fun at parties,

21:50.320 --> 21:51.840
people can't get enough of me.

21:53.000 --> 21:55.080
-I thought we were friends now.
-What?

21:56.680 --> 21:57.960
What made you think that?

21:58.040 --> 22:00.840
I'm not spending another night
stuck inside with my brother.

22:00.920 --> 22:03.040
Seriously,
my brain's a precious commodity,

22:03.120 --> 22:05.120
and it's slowly dying from boredom.

22:05.840 --> 22:07.280
Don't let it die, Maeve.

22:07.720 --> 22:09.600
Please? Please?

22:09.680 --> 22:11.360
Oh, my God. Okay, fine!

22:11.920 --> 22:14.400
-Do I have time to change my shirt?
-No.

22:14.960 --> 22:17.920
Also, all of our brains are slowly dying.
You're not unique.

22:18.920 --> 22:21.200
Oh, my goodness.
I'm terrible at making decisions.

22:21.280 --> 22:23.400
I usually just have what Michael's having.

22:24.320 --> 22:25.640
I mean,

22:25.880 --> 22:27.880
I used to have what Michael was having.

22:28.640 --> 22:31.680
Well, do what I do sometimes:
close your eyes and point.

22:32.560 --> 22:33.880
- Okay.
-It works.

22:33.960 --> 22:34.920
What can I get you?

22:37.200 --> 22:39.200
I'll have a three-legged monkey, please.

22:39.280 --> 22:40.720
- Oh!

22:40.800 --> 22:43.120
-And you?
-I'll have one of those too.

22:43.200 --> 22:44.960
- Thank you.

22:45.880 --> 22:49.000
Yes, being on your own
will get easier, I promise.

22:49.080 --> 22:53.920
Before you know it, you'll be wondering
how you ever shared the TV remote.

22:54.000 --> 22:54.880
I hope so.

22:55.720 --> 22:57.960
How's your... man friend?

22:58.360 --> 23:02.200
Um... we split up, actually.

23:02.280 --> 23:04.840
Oh, I'm sorry. What happened?

23:06.280 --> 23:10.040
I think I realized I'd become
too independent for relationships.

23:10.120 --> 23:11.120
Hmm.

23:12.360 --> 23:14.200
I sometimes get worried
that I'm going to end up

23:14.280 --> 23:17.600
-like my poor old Auntie Gladys.
-What happened to her?

23:18.080 --> 23:19.920
She choked to death on a microwave dinner.

23:20.000 --> 23:22.440
-What?
-Nobody found her for two weeks.

23:22.520 --> 23:23.400
Really?

23:25.720 --> 23:27.960
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

23:29.320 --> 23:31.560
Well, here's to Auntie Gladys then.

23:31.640 --> 23:32.800
To Auntie Gladys.

23:34.680 --> 23:38.760
<i>♪ Life is so strange when you don't know ♪</i>

23:38.840 --> 23:42.800

23:53.400 --> 23:54.560
-Excuse me.
-Hey!

23:58.200 --> 24:01.160
-Eric? Hi! I am going to kill you.
-Hey.

24:01.240 --> 24:04.080
Why? I didn't invite this many people.

24:04.480 --> 24:07.360
-Is Ola here?
-Why would Ola be here?

24:07.440 --> 24:09.720
-We have broken up.
-Okay. I thought the whole point of this

24:09.800 --> 24:11.560
was for you to show Ola that you're chill.

24:11.640 --> 24:13.680
-Should I get you both drinks?
-Yeah.

24:13.760 --> 24:16.600
Yeah, Otis needs a drink. Okay, dude.
Dude...

24:18.000 --> 24:21.480
this is the closest to cool in sixth form
you're ever gonna get.

24:22.840 --> 24:24.720
Enjoy it, okay?

24:24.800 --> 24:26.680
En-joy-ment.

24:27.080 --> 24:28.960
-Here it is.
-Thank you.

24:31.160 --> 24:32.240
Chin-chin.

24:34.520 --> 24:35.520
Ooh.

24:35.600 --> 24:37.840
Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.

24:49.840 --> 24:50.880
Well,

24:52.040 --> 24:54.560
this isn't exactly disability-friendly,
is it?

24:54.640 --> 24:57.400
-Yeah, well you wanted to come.
-And you didn't think about these stairs

24:57.480 --> 24:59.160
versus wheelchair situation.

24:59.560 --> 25:00.520
I'm sorry.

25:01.000 --> 25:03.120
-Let's just go home.
-I'm not going home.

25:03.200 --> 25:04.400
I'm here to par-tay.

25:04.840 --> 25:07.480
But that does mean you're gonna
have to carry me down these stairs.

25:07.560 --> 25:09.800
-Are you joking?
-Does it look like I'm joking?

25:10.240 --> 25:11.760
Hello, kind sir.

25:11.840 --> 25:14.160
Would you be so generous as to escort me

25:14.240 --> 25:16.680
and my chair down these ridiculous steps?

25:17.160 --> 25:19.720
-I just had a cast taken off, so I can't.
-No, it's fine.

25:20.120 --> 25:21.880
I'm sensing a hint of tension here.

25:22.320 --> 25:24.080
Did you guys used to go out or something?

25:24.960 --> 25:28.280
-So, who broke whose heart?
-Shut up, Isaac.

25:29.600 --> 25:30.560
Boys.

25:31.800 --> 25:33.640
-Could you give us a hand getting...
-Isaac.

25:33.720 --> 25:36.240
-...Isaac a lift downstairs, please?
-Sure.

25:38.120 --> 25:41.480
-Enjoy the party, Isaac.
-Grab a corner, boys. One, two...

25:43.320 --> 25:45.880
So, I'm assuming it was you
who was the breaker of hearts then.

25:45.960 --> 25:47.040
Okay, we're done here.

25:52.680 --> 25:55.360
Hey, Jackson! Are you looking forward
to the dress rehearsal tomorrow?

25:55.440 --> 25:56.280
-Oh, man. You--
-Mate,

25:56.360 --> 25:58.160
he's not doing that gay Shakespeare shit.

25:58.240 --> 25:59.720
Look, he's back in the pool.

26:01.840 --> 26:03.880
Ruby is looking banging tonight.

26:04.760 --> 26:05.600
You could never.

26:06.360 --> 26:07.560
Fuck off, Marchetti.

26:07.640 --> 26:08.720
Dex is here.

26:08.800 --> 26:11.280
-Um, hi.
-I don't have time for "hi".

26:11.360 --> 26:13.400
I know I need to go talk to him,
but I don't know how.

26:13.480 --> 26:16.360
Well, just go up to him and say,
"Hey, Dex," and ask him about his day

26:16.440 --> 26:17.880
or a game that he likes

26:17.960 --> 26:20.080
or another nerdy-type thing
you lot like talking about.

26:20.160 --> 26:23.080
Then you keep chatting
and see where the night takes you. Easy.

26:24.320 --> 26:26.120
Be yourself, all right?
And you'll be fine.

26:26.440 --> 26:28.800
I just realized that your cast is gone.
That's great news.

26:28.880 --> 26:30.320
Yeah, back to prison for me.

26:30.960 --> 26:33.160
I'm joking. Go and get your man.

26:38.760 --> 26:42.280
-Is that Maeve? Why is Maeve here?
-I kind of invited her.

26:43.080 --> 26:44.720
-What?
-You guys need to talk.

26:44.800 --> 26:47.720
I'm not talking to her.
She can talk to me.

26:47.800 --> 26:49.280
Who is that guy?

26:50.080 --> 26:52.840
-No idea.
-This isn't really my scene, to be honest.

26:52.920 --> 26:54.240
What's your scene then?

26:54.320 --> 26:57.480
Uh... I don't know.
Reading a book somewhere alone.

26:58.480 --> 27:00.560
People need people.

27:01.520 --> 27:04.200
Is that another NA motivational quote
by any chance?

27:04.280 --> 27:07.840
No, more of a core value, actually.

27:09.040 --> 27:10.800
Who's the intense starey guy?

27:12.440 --> 27:13.640
That's Otis.

27:13.720 --> 27:16.800
It's his party. Things are a bit weird
between us right now.

27:17.360 --> 27:19.680
-Is he your boyfriend?
-No.

27:20.120 --> 27:22.160
But you wanted him to be your boyfriend?

27:24.040 --> 27:27.160
-You're not actually psychic, you know.
-But I'm pretty close, right?

27:28.120 --> 27:30.440
Don't tell me, you didn't think
he would be my type.

27:30.520 --> 27:32.520
No, I think he's exactly your type.

27:32.600 --> 27:36.280
I bet he's funny and charming
in a sweet, non-threatening way.

27:37.400 --> 27:40.240
In fact, he looks a little bit like me,

27:40.320 --> 27:45.240
but less interesting, which means
I must really, really be your type then.

27:45.320 --> 27:46.800
Shut up!

27:47.280 --> 27:48.480
- Hiya.
-Hiya.

27:48.920 --> 27:51.240
-This is my friend, Isaac.
-Hiya, Isaac.

27:51.320 --> 27:53.040
-Why are you in a wheelchair?
- Babes, no.

27:53.120 --> 27:54.680
-You're not supposed--
-It's fine.

27:54.760 --> 27:57.320
It was a horrendous incident
involving the wind.

27:58.280 --> 27:59.440
Fuck off.

27:59.520 --> 28:03.840
Forty-three quintillion
possible combinations, but in theory,

28:03.920 --> 28:06.120
it can be solved in just 20 moves.

28:06.200 --> 28:07.320
Interesting.

28:09.400 --> 28:11.920
Uh, Viv, can I ask you something?

28:13.640 --> 28:15.000
Which is your favorite color?

28:15.400 --> 28:18.000
Oh, probably seafoam green.

28:18.080 --> 28:19.600
No, on the cube?

28:22.760 --> 28:24.640
Sometimes when I'm in the supermarket...

28:24.720 --> 28:27.000
-Mm.
-...I like looking at people...

28:27.080 --> 28:27.920
Mm.

28:28.000 --> 28:29.920
...and imagine having sex with them.

28:30.000 --> 28:30.920
Oh.

28:31.000 --> 28:32.040
Last week,

28:32.880 --> 28:37.080
I had this fantasy about the man
who teaches my Zumba class.

28:37.480 --> 28:39.600
And then, what... So what was the fantasy?

28:40.000 --> 28:41.920
I was on the dance floor...

28:42.680 --> 28:44.800
and he was standing up at the bar.

28:45.480 --> 28:47.200
-We caught eyes.
-Oh.

28:47.760 --> 28:48.600
And then,

28:49.240 --> 28:53.240
all of a sudden, we're having rampant sex

28:54.040 --> 28:56.200
at the back of the dance floor.

28:59.120 --> 29:02.400
-Oh, we should go dancing.
-It was only a fantasy.

29:02.480 --> 29:04.760
No, I know but let's go dancing.

29:05.280 --> 29:06.560
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

29:06.960 --> 29:09.200
-Let's go dancing.
-Let's go dancing.

29:09.280 --> 29:10.120
Dancing.

29:13.800 --> 29:15.560
I didn't know you were having a party.

29:16.480 --> 29:19.240
-You didn't invite me.
-Oh, hi, Ola.

29:20.000 --> 29:21.960
It was very spontaneous.

29:22.640 --> 29:25.320
Just... casual. It was a chill decision.

29:25.400 --> 29:27.440
-You know.
-You said you wanted me to come

29:27.520 --> 29:28.840
and pick up some stuff.

29:29.920 --> 29:32.840
Yes, I... Yeah, so...

29:32.920 --> 29:35.600
You left a T-shirt.

29:36.120 --> 29:40.120
And a... mug with our faces on it
that you bought me.

29:40.200 --> 29:41.480
I don't want it anymore.

29:41.840 --> 29:42.760
Okay.

29:43.680 --> 29:45.960
-And some tools. Your dad left tools.
- Okay.

29:46.040 --> 29:47.400
It's upstairs.

29:48.080 --> 29:49.640
- About that research.

29:49.720 --> 29:52.360
Nick wants to go home and have sex
because your party's pathetic,

29:52.440 --> 29:55.240
and I cannot have
an unclean arsehole, okay?

29:55.640 --> 29:58.800
-Sure. I spoke with Rahim about it.
-You told Rahim?

29:59.880 --> 30:02.000
I did not tell Rahim about you, okay?

30:02.080 --> 30:04.000
I am a very professional.

30:05.280 --> 30:06.120
Rahim said...

30:07.200 --> 30:08.200
Rahim said...

30:10.320 --> 30:11.240
Rahim said...

30:14.920 --> 30:15.760
You squat.

30:16.640 --> 30:17.560
You squat.

30:21.400 --> 30:22.240
And release.

30:22.720 --> 30:23.960
I think you should go.

30:25.520 --> 30:27.760
-I live here.
-I don't care.

30:28.600 --> 30:29.440
Okay.

30:30.480 --> 30:33.400
I'm gonna get another drink.
This one has sick in it.

31:15.120 --> 31:18.040
I'm sorry about the kiss thing.
I didn't mean to upset you.

31:18.520 --> 31:20.680
Can we just go back
to the way we were before?

31:21.400 --> 31:23.440
I don't think we can be friends anymore.

31:23.920 --> 31:25.120
It's too confusing.

31:25.200 --> 31:27.360
Wait! Lily, can we just talk?

31:27.440 --> 31:28.280
Lily!

31:28.360 --> 31:31.400
Marchetti,
I'm gonna smash you in practice this week.

31:43.160 --> 31:45.000
Oh, fuck.

31:45.560 --> 31:46.960
Ooh.

31:59.360 --> 32:01.920
There you are.
You need to rescue me from Dex.

32:06.040 --> 32:07.080
What you doing?

32:13.800 --> 32:15.160
I did it to myself.

32:18.360 --> 32:20.720
I put my hand under the weight
because I wanted it to stop,

32:20.800 --> 32:23.680
and then it did stop
and it felt amazing, but now...

32:24.920 --> 32:27.720
it's starting again, and it feels like
my head's about to explode

32:27.800 --> 32:30.600
if it doesn't stop.
I just need it to stop, like...

32:33.280 --> 32:37.320
-What to stop?
-This fucking pressure.

32:49.320 --> 32:50.400
It's okay.

32:50.960 --> 32:54.200
But you can't keep on hurting yourself.

32:57.680 --> 32:59.800
What are you gonna say happened this time?

33:02.120 --> 33:03.840
That I got into a fight.

33:06.160 --> 33:07.600
But I didn't do it, so...

33:08.920 --> 33:12.200
And I'm not gonna do it, right?
I know it was dumb, so...

33:13.640 --> 33:15.800
Sorry, I don't know why
I'm telling you all this.

33:17.200 --> 33:18.840
You need to tell your parents
what you did.

33:18.920 --> 33:21.000
Don't be stupid.
They would never understand.

33:21.080 --> 33:22.200
I'm not being stupid.

33:22.280 --> 33:24.800
Statistically, people that self-harm
are nine times more likely

33:24.880 --> 33:28.320
to attempt taking their own lives.
You need to get professional help.

33:28.400 --> 33:29.960
I don't need professional help.

33:30.680 --> 33:33.280
I just need to tell them
that I'm not doing what they want anymore.

33:33.360 --> 33:34.960
You self-harm, Jackson.

33:35.040 --> 33:36.640
-And the statistics show--
-I don't care

33:36.720 --> 33:38.920
about your fucking statistics, Viv!

33:39.760 --> 33:40.800
What is wrong with you?

33:43.240 --> 33:45.320
You say you don't have
any friends because you're busy,

33:45.440 --> 33:47.760
but it's actually because
you're a fucking robot.

33:50.120 --> 33:51.320
Thanks a lot, Jackson.

33:52.200 --> 33:53.200
That's good to know.

34:02.640 --> 34:03.720
Fuck.

I was gonna cook a chicken, but I didn't.

38:50.920 --> 38:52.040
What did I do wrong?

38:55.040 --> 38:57.600
You bullied me for years, Adam.

38:59.120 --> 39:01.280
You made me feel unsafe for years.

39:01.360 --> 39:04.200
You were one of the main reasons
I wasn't kind to myself.

39:04.600 --> 39:07.160
And I'm supposed to believe
that you've suddenly changed?

39:08.600 --> 39:13.600
You're full of shame, man,
and I can't be in that place anymore.

39:14.440 --> 39:17.480
I've had to work really hard
to love myself, and I won't go back

39:17.560 --> 39:19.840
-to hiding things about me again.
-I'm scared.

39:23.160 --> 39:24.960
And I think I'm bisexual.

39:29.440 --> 39:30.520
Are you all right?

39:38.360 --> 39:40.040

-I feel like everyone hates me.

39:47.960 --> 39:50.840

without my knowledge.

40:33.200 --> 40:34.760
I didn't want her here at all.

40:36.840 --> 40:38.320

-to my party guests.

41:04.640 --> 41:06.640
Um, so, this is Ola.

41:07.200 --> 41:10.480
I don't know if you know her.
She's well, quite little and...

41:11.000 --> 41:15.120
and funny, and interesting, and pretty,
and she was my girlfriend

41:15.840 --> 41:19.280
until she told me
I can't see Maeve anymore.

41:19.680 --> 41:21.960
Now, we all know Maeve. Scary Maeve.

41:22.360 --> 41:24.800
You know, she's not actually scary.
She's just pretending.

41:25.200 --> 41:26.360
-Anyway...

41:26.440 --> 41:29.000
Maeve told me that she liked me, okay?

41:29.080 --> 41:30.600
And I like Maeve.

41:31.400 --> 41:34.960
I like Maeve a lot,
a lot more than I liked Ola.

41:36.240 --> 41:40.600
-Otis. Otis, get off--
-But I was trying to be a good boyfriend,

41:40.680 --> 41:43.480
so I said to Maeve,
"Sorry, I can't see you anymore."

41:44.160 --> 41:46.240
And then, Ola dumped me.

41:46.680 --> 41:49.160
Yeah, it's confusing. I was confused.

41:49.800 --> 41:51.720
But I thought probably a good thing

41:52.240 --> 41:54.600
'cause I just really wanted to be
with Maeve.

41:55.040 --> 41:57.840
And I didn't really want to be with Ola,
and then I realized

41:58.440 --> 42:02.560
Maeve Wiley just likes playing
with people's feelings,

42:02.640 --> 42:04.040
and she doesn't care
about anyone else.

42:04.120 --> 42:06.840
Like, she brought this... man with her.

42:07.400 --> 42:10.400
I don't know, probably just here
to make me jealous.

42:10.560 --> 42:12.640
-Definitely didn't work.
- It definitely did.

42:13.640 --> 42:14.640
All in all,

42:15.200 --> 42:18.360
I think she's probably
the most selfish person I've ever met.

42:20.000 --> 42:23.360
And I think it's good
that I'm not going out with either of them

42:23.760 --> 42:26.360
because I think I deserve
a whole lot more.

42:26.920 --> 42:29.080
Thank you for coming. Good night.

42:29.600 --> 42:32.160
Not good night. Stay, enjoy yourselves.

42:32.240 --> 42:33.120
Music on, please!

42:35.360 --> 42:36.680
You're welcome to him.

42:41.000 --> 42:43.600
-What is her problem?
-You're an arsehole.

42:43.680 --> 42:44.600
Hey!

42:50.080 --> 42:51.360
Eh-oooh!

42:52.920 --> 42:54.000
Shall we go, An?

42:56.000 --> 42:58.840
Uh, you know what? I think I'm gonna stay
for a bit, actually.

42:59.880 --> 43:01.000
Okay, alright.

43:02.880 --> 43:04.200
Hey, um...

43:04.840 --> 43:08.600
I hope I didn't put any pressure on you
about having sex.

43:09.200 --> 43:11.680
We don't have to do anything
you don't want to do.

43:11.760 --> 43:14.200
No, yeah, I know. Thanks.

43:15.200 --> 43:16.840
Right. Well, I'll see you later.

43:16.920 --> 43:17.960
Okay. See you.

43:18.800 --> 43:19.640
Nick?

43:22.360 --> 43:24.400
I do want to have sex with you.

43:25.240 --> 43:26.920
I've just never done it before.

43:30.720 --> 43:32.440
And I don't know how to douche.

43:34.400 --> 43:35.360
You should have said.

43:36.440 --> 43:38.880
Anwar, I didn't know how to do
any of that stuff either.

43:39.680 --> 43:41.000
I'll show you if you want?

43:42.200 --> 43:43.720
-Okay.
-Okay?

43:43.800 --> 43:45.120
-Yeah.
-All right.

43:45.200 --> 43:46.040
Let's go.

43:58.520 --> 43:59.400
Jesus.

44:00.960 --> 44:03.520
-What are you doing here?
-I didn't want to go home.

44:03.960 --> 44:05.240
Why'd you throw your shoe at me?

44:07.320 --> 44:08.400
I'm angry.

44:10.160 --> 44:11.560
Do you wanna go smash some shit?

No wind, or youths,

45:43.680 --> 45:44.600
All right.

45:45.440 --> 45:49.840
-Um... Yeah, I was ten.
-Mm-hmm.

45:49.920 --> 45:52.360
Joe and I
were still living with our parents.

45:52.440 --> 45:55.160
They would send us out
so they could get high.

45:55.680 --> 45:59.480
Anyway, on this particular day,
I dared Joe to climb up this massive tree,

46:00.040 --> 46:02.320
and he chickened out halfway up.

46:02.720 --> 46:04.680
So, of course,
I wanted to prove that I was braver

46:04.760 --> 46:06.760
and get all the way up to the top,

46:07.440 --> 46:08.560
which I did.

46:09.960 --> 46:11.320
And then I fell.

46:12.920 --> 46:14.520
That's it. That's the story.

46:18.920 --> 46:20.320
Do you blame your parents?

46:20.960 --> 46:21.800
No.

46:21.880 --> 46:25.160
I sometimes blame them for not sticking
with the parenting thing, though.

46:26.600 --> 46:28.120
Yeah, that bit kind of sucked.

46:29.840 --> 46:31.680
Okay, well, I've got one for you.

46:32.240 --> 46:34.720
Behold. I was eight.

46:35.960 --> 46:39.800
My mum didn't take me to school.
She used to sleep a lot back then.

46:39.880 --> 46:42.120
I tried to make myself beans on toast.

46:43.840 --> 46:45.840
My brother had to call an ambulance.

46:47.000 --> 46:48.440
Must've been some hot beans.

46:49.840 --> 46:50.680
Yeah.

46:52.800 --> 46:53.880
Anyway, that's mine.

46:56.320 --> 46:59.000
That Otis guy
wouldn't understand this shit.

46:59.080 --> 47:01.480
He wouldn't get it.
It's not in his little world.

47:01.640 --> 47:04.240
-Otis has got family problems too.
-That's different.

47:04.800 --> 47:07.400
If you grow up knowing the people
who are meant to make sure you survive

47:07.480 --> 47:08.520
just left you...

47:09.640 --> 47:11.000
it leaves a lot of scars.

47:11.920 --> 47:13.800
But those scars make you special.

47:14.440 --> 47:16.800
And you and I are properly special.

47:22.360 --> 47:24.760
And for the record, I'm sorry
about what I said about your mum.

47:26.120 --> 47:29.080

that someone came back for you.
