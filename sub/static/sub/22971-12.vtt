- [QUEEN USURNA] Shall we begin?
- [THUD]

00:54.596 --> 00:59.934
The Trollhunter is on trial
for choosing to go into the Darklands,

01:00.018 --> 01:02.437
allowing the release
of Gunmar the Black.

01:02.729 --> 01:07.233
James Lake, Jr. has admitted
responsibility for his actions.

01:07.317 --> 01:10.987
- What say you of the charges?
- We'll fight the charge!

01:11.071 --> 01:15.784
Once convicted, the Trollhunter
will be sentenced to exile in the Deep.

01:15.867 --> 01:18.578
- What's the Deep?
- A place of unknown madness.

01:18.661 --> 01:21.831
No one exactly knows what resides
at the bottom of the Deep,

01:21.915 --> 01:24.626
because no Troll
has ever returned from it.

01:24.709 --> 01:27.712
- What do I do?
- Shall we begin?

01:27.796 --> 01:29.464
One moment, if you please.

01:30.131 --> 01:32.175
- You cannot fight these allegations.
- I have to.

01:32.258 --> 01:35.845
Merlin visited me in a sorta dream.

01:35.929 --> 01:37.430
And he wants me to fight.

01:37.514 --> 01:38.973
- [GASPS]
- Merlin?

01:39.057 --> 01:42.352
Visited in a "sorta dream"? [CHUCKLES]

01:42.435 --> 01:44.562
- I believe you!
- Really?

01:44.646 --> 01:46.731
I believe you've finally cracked.

01:46.815 --> 01:48.942
So much for having you represent me.

01:49.025 --> 01:51.152
[VENDEL] Unfortunately, Trollhunter,

01:51.236 --> 01:56.699
Troll Law states that the accused may
only be represented by his own tribe.

01:56.783 --> 01:58.284
- Yes.
- Hmm.

01:58.368 --> 02:00.870
But these children don't know
the slightest about Troll Law.

02:00.954 --> 02:05.416
Be that as it may, the rules are
quite clear on this matter.

02:05.500 --> 02:08.169
- Only a human may speak for the accused.
- Oh.

02:09.044 --> 02:12.757
- Give us a minute to talk it over?
- Hm. Very well.

02:13.341 --> 02:15.385
Okay. We can do this.

02:15.468 --> 02:18.680
- Claire.
- Nah-uh. I don't know anything about law.

02:18.763 --> 02:21.141
- Let alone Troll Law.
- It's not as hard as it looks.

02:21.224 --> 02:23.726
All you gotta do is walk around
like you own the place

02:23.810 --> 02:28.439
and throw around fancy words like,
subpoena! Hearsay! Redirect!

02:28.523 --> 02:32.152
Res ipsa loquitur! Nolo contendere!

02:32.735 --> 02:33.987
Fancy.

02:34.070 --> 02:35.363
How did that metal mouth of yours

02:35.446 --> 02:38.283
just manage to garble out
all those exquisite words?

02:38.366 --> 02:41.286
Eh, I've watched every episode
of Mistrial and Error with my nana.

02:41.369 --> 02:44.455
ALSO MISTRIAL AND ERROR: New Orleans,
MISTRIAL AND ERROR: Jury Duty, oh,

02:44.539 --> 02:47.375
- AND MISTRIAL AND ERROR: Try, Try Again.
- [QUEEN USURNA] Your time is up.

02:47.458 --> 02:50.879
Have you made a decision
on who will represent you?

02:51.462 --> 02:54.048
We have. Toby Domzalski.

02:54.132 --> 02:55.258
Wait, what? Me?

02:55.341 --> 02:56.175
[SHIVERS]

02:56.259 --> 02:58.261
I can't believe I'm agreeing.

02:58.344 --> 03:01.806
Very well.
The Tribunal will permit a short recess

03:01.890 --> 03:04.559
to allow Mr. Domzalski
to prepare his case.

03:04.642 --> 03:05.560
[TOBY CHUCKLES]

03:05.643 --> 03:09.564
And by "short," you mean a month, right?

03:09.647 --> 03:11.524
- [JIM] You can do this, Tobes.
- As your counsel,

03:11.608 --> 03:15.195
- I advise you this is a terrible idea!
- But not our worst. Right?

03:15.653 --> 03:17.947
No, it's worst.

03:18.031 --> 03:22.076
[BLINKY] You'll need this book, also
this one. And, yes, especially that one.

03:22.160 --> 03:26.164
Uh, this idea of me representing Jim
is getting less and less appealing.

03:26.247 --> 03:28.291
Jim's life depends on this, Blinky.

03:28.374 --> 03:31.419
Throwing around big words from a TV show
isn't going to save him.

03:31.502 --> 03:33.630
- And your meaning?
- Meaning,

03:33.713 --> 03:36.966
how are we going to convince the
Tribunal Jim didn't let Gunmar out?

03:37.050 --> 03:41.387
I mean, just to be perfectly clear,
we all know we're guilty of that.

03:41.471 --> 03:44.474
I can see why Master Jim chose Tobias
over you to be his advocate.

03:44.557 --> 03:47.977
Wait a sec. Gunmar told Jim
he has a spy in Trollmarket, right?

03:48.061 --> 03:48.895
[TOBY GRUNTS]

03:49.604 --> 03:52.482
If we can prove Gunmar is working
with someone on the outside...

03:52.565 --> 03:56.319
That "someone" would have freed him
from the Darklands, anyway.

03:56.402 --> 03:58.988
- Could that argument actually work?
- Definitely.

03:59.072 --> 04:01.241
It's like that episode
OF MISTRIAL AND ERROR: Swamp Law

04:01.324 --> 04:03.368
where Detective Jim Belaya
discovered evidence

04:03.451 --> 04:06.955
that gator people were just
as responsible for the murder.

04:07.038 --> 04:08.831
"Gator people"?

04:08.915 --> 04:12.043
I don't know what that means,
but our course of action is clear.

04:12.126 --> 04:15.922
Tobias will stall for time while
Claire and I root out Gunmar's agent.

04:16.005 --> 04:17.882
I definitely like the "more time" part.

04:18.675 --> 04:21.052
- And me?
- [BLINKY] Co-counsel, of course.

04:21.135 --> 04:21.970
Wingman!

04:22.053 --> 04:24.305
[GRUNTS, SIGHS]

04:24.389 --> 04:27.934
You know, it might just be easier to
prove that gator people let Gunmar out.

04:28.017 --> 04:28.851
[CLAIRE] Hmm.

04:29.435 --> 04:31.437
[CLAIRE] Toby might not last long
in there.

04:31.521 --> 04:33.064
How're we gonna find Gunmar's stooge

04:33.147 --> 04:35.692
when we haven't been able to find him
in weeks?

04:35.775 --> 04:38.069
Have you seen these television shows
of Tobias?

04:38.152 --> 04:38.987
A couple.

04:39.070 --> 04:41.990
What would the characters
on those programs do in this situation?

04:42.073 --> 04:45.702
That's not a bad idea. Jim Belaya
would start with an informant.

04:45.785 --> 04:48.871
Someone who knows the swamp,
who can provide information.

04:48.955 --> 04:53.001
Brilliant! We should proceed precisely
as Detective Belaya would.

04:53.668 --> 04:57.714
Aarghaumont. As we have stated,
you cannot speak on the Trollhunter's...

04:58.798 --> 05:00.425
Tobias Domzalski...

05:01.592 --> 05:04.220
Esquire, appearing for the defendant.

05:04.679 --> 05:07.932
Waive reading, plead "not guilty."

05:09.183 --> 05:11.894
- Why are you speaking like that?
- Too much?

05:11.978 --> 05:12.812
[SIGHS]

05:13.438 --> 05:14.272
[CHUCKLES]

05:15.690 --> 05:17.442
First order of business.

05:18.401 --> 05:19.235
[EXHALES]

05:19.944 --> 05:24.866
We hereby motion to remove Gatto
as a member of the Tribunal.

05:24.949 --> 05:27.869
His presence is prejudicial
to the defense.

05:27.952 --> 05:29.037
How so?

05:29.120 --> 05:32.457
He and I have a rather delicate history,

05:32.540 --> 05:34.959
which brings his ability to be objective
into question.

05:35.043 --> 05:37.253
Feel free to take your time
filling the appointment.

05:37.336 --> 05:40.131
We'll come back later.
How does next year sound?

05:40.214 --> 05:42.925
- [THUDS]
- Your objection is rejected.

05:43.009 --> 05:45.845
On the grounds there are no objections
in Troll Law.

05:45.928 --> 05:49.098
Well, then please have it noted
for the record.

05:49.807 --> 05:51.517
- And the MP3.
- [SIGHS]

05:51.601 --> 05:54.562
[VENDEL]
Enough. The Tribunal will proceed.

05:54.645 --> 05:56.856
State the grounds for your defense.

05:57.440 --> 05:58.274
No grounds.

05:58.357 --> 06:01.903
- The defendant is guilty as charged!
- What?

06:01.986 --> 06:02.987
[ALL GASP]

06:03.071 --> 06:06.407
Maybe you don't know
how this is supposed to work.

06:06.491 --> 06:10.161
Don't worry, Jimbo.
All the best episodes start like this.

06:10.244 --> 06:13.998
We know Jim went into the Darklands!

06:15.041 --> 06:19.087
We know we went in to save him!

06:20.213 --> 06:26.219
We know that gave Gunmar
the opportunity to escape!

06:26.302 --> 06:29.514
But what don't we know, hmm?

06:29.597 --> 06:34.852
That is what the defense will prove here
beyond a shadow of reasonable doubt.

06:34.936 --> 06:36.854
- [STONE SWOOSHES]
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey!

06:36.938 --> 06:38.106

- Hey! Hey!

06:38.189 --> 06:39.357
[GRUNTS]

06:39.440 --> 06:41.609
Why are they throwing rocks?

06:41.692 --> 06:42.610

[GRUNTS]

06:44.987 --> 06:45.947
[SHRIEKS, GROANS]

06:46.030 --> 06:49.700
Gatto's rock wins.
Gatto will be heard first.

06:49.784 --> 06:52.286
I have a number of complaints.

06:52.370 --> 06:55.164
Where should I begin?

06:55.248 --> 06:56.082
[SIGHS]

07:01.295 --> 07:05.424
Hold! RotGut is a tough customer,
or should I say "salesman"?

07:05.508 --> 07:09.303
We're asking for sensitive information.
He's bound to drive a hard bargain.

07:09.387 --> 07:12.348
We don't have time for that.
Let's try "good cop, bad cop."

07:12.432 --> 07:14.434
I think I know
where you're going with this.

07:14.517 --> 07:16.477
[CHUCKLES] I shall play this game.

07:16.561 --> 07:17.645
[KNOCKS ON DOOR]

07:18.229 --> 07:21.858
[CLEARS THROAT] Open up, RotGut,
or I'll kick down this door!

07:22.442 --> 07:23.734
[GUT] Ailment or curse?

07:23.818 --> 07:27.196
Neither, you two-headed dirtbag!
We need information.

07:27.280 --> 07:29.907
Gunmar's got a mole down here,
and you're gonna tell us who it is!

07:30.199 --> 07:32.994
[ROT] Why is she being
so mean to us, Gut?

07:33.077 --> 07:37.248
We don't share that sort of thing.
Salesman-client confidentiality.

07:37.331 --> 07:40.168
Oh, you wanna obstruct
official Trollhunting business?

07:40.251 --> 07:43.296
Is that what you wanna do? [GROANS]

07:43.379 --> 07:44.380
Now you've done it!

07:44.464 --> 07:47.300
I feel my anger rising.
I can't control it.

07:47.383 --> 07:51.804
You might want to talk to my partner,
because I'm about to explode!

07:53.306 --> 07:55.516
- Hmm.
- Mm-hm.

07:55.600 --> 07:56.767
Ahem!

07:57.393 --> 07:59.228
[SCREAMS]

07:59.312 --> 08:01.439
If you don't tell us what we
need to know this instant,

08:01.522 --> 08:03.483
I'll turn us all into a smoking crater!

08:03.566 --> 08:07.069
[GUT] Are you insane?
You're gonna kill us all!

08:07.153 --> 08:09.071
Whoa, whoa, Blinky, what are you doing?

08:09.155 --> 08:13.659
I'm buying, baby. I'm buying the farm
if they don't start talking!

08:13.743 --> 08:15.870
Wait. I thought I was the bad cop.

08:15.953 --> 08:19.415
I thought I was the bad cop.
Your performance felt a little ho-hum.

08:19.499 --> 08:22.335
[GUT] Don't blow us up.
We'll tell you whatever you want!

08:22.418 --> 08:25.796
[ROT] I don't know from Gunmar,
but there was a guy.

08:25.880 --> 08:28.591
- It's Krax, you imbecile.
- Yes. Krax.

08:28.674 --> 08:31.636
He bought out our entire stock
of gaggletacks.

08:31.719 --> 08:32.553
Gaggletacks?

08:32.636 --> 08:36.224
- The mole might be a Changeling.
- Or helping them.

08:36.307 --> 08:39.352
Wait, what am I supposed
to do with this?

08:39.434 --> 08:41.938
- [BUZZING]
- Oh! Oh!

08:44.315 --> 08:46.192
[EXPLOSION]

08:46.275 --> 08:47.860
[MALE TROLL] My boutique!

08:47.944 --> 08:48.945
Sorry!

08:49.612 --> 08:51.572
- Uh. [CHUCKLES]
- Uh...

08:51.656 --> 08:55.785
RotGut, you don't happen to have
this Krax fellow's address?

08:57.161 --> 09:01.666
Isn't it true
you've been to the Darklands?

09:01.749 --> 09:02.583
[SNIFFS]

09:02.667 --> 09:04.710
Isn't it further true

09:04.794 --> 09:08.756
that you know Gunmar was trying
to get out of the Darklands on his own?

09:08.839 --> 09:11.259
Huh? Isn't it further, further true

09:11.342 --> 09:14.220
that he probably would've
gotten out eventually anyway

09:14.303 --> 09:16.222
even if we hadn't gone in to save Jim?

09:16.305 --> 09:18.140
Hey! [GROANS] Cut it out!

09:18.224 --> 09:20.685
[BORAK] It sounds like
you're testifying.

09:20.768 --> 09:22.895
I'm questioning my witness, butt-brain!

09:23.479 --> 09:25.565
That's a legal term of art.

09:25.648 --> 09:26.941
Nice recovery, Tobes.

09:27.024 --> 09:31.404
If we're to hear from your witness,
let us hear from it.

09:31.487 --> 09:33.823
Not "it." "Him."

09:33.906 --> 09:38.619
Now as I was saying, Jim's a good guy.
You know, for a human.

09:38.703 --> 09:42.081
While he was in the Darklands,
he saved me familiar.

09:42.164 --> 09:45.418
A pretty cute kid. You
know, for a human.

09:46.419 --> 09:49.255
So, to you, Jim is a hero?

09:49.338 --> 09:50.965
- [BORAK] Hmm.
- Let me just...

09:51.048 --> 09:53.175
Yeah, he's a hero.

09:53.259 --> 09:56.304
I mean, if he wasn't,
you guys wouldn't have gone into...

09:56.387 --> 09:57.430
[GASPS]

09:57.513 --> 09:59.473
- That's enough. Thanks a lot.
- [NOTENRIQUE CHEWS]

09:59.557 --> 10:02.768
No. I think the witness
should be allowed to finish!

10:02.852 --> 10:05.688
No, he's my witness!
You said he was my witness!

10:05.771 --> 10:07.023
You're my witness.

10:07.106 --> 10:09.650
[QUEEN USURNA]
This witness will finish its statement.

10:09.734 --> 10:15.072
I ain't an "it"! Jeez!
I don't see what the big deal is.

10:15.156 --> 10:19.660
I was just gonna say that if Lake
hadn't been, you know, Lake,

10:19.744 --> 10:21.787
Gunmar would have never gotten out.

10:21.871 --> 10:25.833
Objection! Move to strike!
Move to strike that from the record!

10:25.916 --> 10:30.212
- But that was your witness.
- Then let me speak for myself.

10:30.296 --> 10:33.215
The accused cannot testify for himself,
according to Troll Law.

10:33.299 --> 10:37.511
Go on, Trollhunter.
Speak from your heart.

10:38.971 --> 10:43.768
Everyone is angry at me
because I made a choice.

10:43.851 --> 10:45.895
A lot of you
think it was the wrong one.

10:45.978 --> 10:49.899
[STAMMERS] Well, wouldn't be the first
time and it won't be the...

10:49.982 --> 10:52.026
Well... maybe it'll be my last.

10:52.610 --> 10:57.365
The truth is, I'm still figuring out
how to do the right thing.

10:57.448 --> 11:01.786
I'm not using that as an excuse.
I accept full responsibility.

11:01.869 --> 11:08.209
But before you condemn me, let me ask.
Who here hasn't made a mistake?

11:08.292 --> 11:11.337
Yes, I went into the Bridge
to save Claire's brother.

11:11.420 --> 11:14.590
