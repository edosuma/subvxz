Ha-har!

01:01.862 --> 01:04.296
Ahoy, mateys!

01:04.298 --> 01:06.999
Do you want to join
my pirate crew?

01:08.501 --> 01:09.501
Great!

01:09.503 --> 01:10.969
To start today's adventure,

01:10.971 --> 01:13.639
everybody say
the Pirate Password:

01:13.641 --> 01:15.340
Yo-ho ho!

01:15.342 --> 01:18.777
- [all] Yo-ho ho!
- One more time!

01:18.779 --> 01:21.046
Yo-ho ho!

01:24.551 --> 01:26.552
<i>[Jake]</i> Cookin' With Hook!

01:26.554 --> 01:29.321
[Skully] Crackers!
We need more crackers!

01:29.323 --> 01:33.158
Don't worry, Skully.
We'll have plenty of food
for Never Land Feast Day.

01:33.160 --> 01:37.663
Aye! And not only are we getting
together for a yummy meal,

01:37.665 --> 01:41.033
we're gonna give thanks for
all the good things we have.

01:41.035 --> 01:43.635
Like mateys,
and crackers!

01:43.637 --> 01:47.806
And that's not all. I'm gonna
cook somethin' really special!

01:47.808 --> 01:51.543
Shipwreck Stew! I need
three things to make it:

01:51.545 --> 01:55.013
Tick Tock Tomatoes
from Crocodile Creek,

01:55.015 --> 01:58.150
spicy hot Lava Beans
from Belch Mountain,

01:58.152 --> 02:01.954
and a Jumpin' Pumpkin from
the Pirate Pumpkin Patch.

02:01.956 --> 02:04.823
Mateys, do you want to go
to Never Land with us

02:04.825 --> 02:07.960
and find the ingredients
for Cubby's Shipwreck Stew?

02:09.596 --> 02:13.098
Great! Remember to keep
a lookout for gold doubloons.

02:13.100 --> 02:15.334
Whenever we solve
a Pirate Problem together,

02:15.336 --> 02:16.635
they'll appear.

02:16.637 --> 02:20.506
Then we'll collect 'em and put
'em in our Team Treasure Chest.

02:20.508 --> 02:22.341
Yo-ho, let's go!

02:22.343 --> 02:25.677
- Is everybody ready?
- I got my sword!

02:25.679 --> 02:29.648
- I got my map!
- And I've got my Pixie Dust!

02:29.650 --> 02:32.951
The fairies gave it to me
so that we can use it to fly.

02:32.953 --> 02:35.354
But only in emergencies!

02:38.525 --> 02:41.493
<i>¶ Yo-ho, mateys, away! </i>

02:41.495 --> 02:44.363
<i>¶ There'll be treasure</i>
<i>and adventure today ¶</i>

02:44.365 --> 02:45.597
<i>¶ Let's go </i>

02:45.599 --> 02:48.767
<i>¶ Heave ho, here we go</i>
<i>Together as a team ¶</i>

02:48.769 --> 02:51.803
<i>¶ Jake and the</i>
<i>Never Land Pirates ¶</i>

02:51.805 --> 02:54.006
<i>¶ And me </i>

02:56.609 --> 03:00.612
[Mama Hook] James! How are
the decorations coming along?

03:00.614 --> 03:04.716
I want the table to look
extra-special this year!

03:04.718 --> 03:09.655
I'm so pleased you could join us
for Never Land Feast Day, Mummy.

03:09.657 --> 03:13.458
Oh, James! You know
I'd never miss a chance

03:13.460 --> 03:15.861
to cook the family recipe

03:15.863 --> 03:20.165
for my bouncing
baby buccaneer.

03:20.167 --> 03:21.767
Now, let's see.

03:21.769 --> 03:26.538
I'm going to make Fried Green
Tick Tock Tomatoes,

03:26.540 --> 03:29.041
Hot Lava Bean Chili,

03:29.043 --> 03:33.612
and a Jumpin' Pumpkin Pie
for dessert.

03:33.614 --> 03:35.881
Oh, yes!

03:35.883 --> 03:40.052
It's been my favorite meal
since I was a wee pirate lad.

03:40.054 --> 03:44.223
So, James, be a good boy and
fetch me everything I need.

03:44.225 --> 03:46.024
And don't dawdle!

03:46.026 --> 03:51.330
I've got lots of cooking
to do, so step lively!

03:51.332 --> 03:54.533
Aye, aye, Mummy!
Steppin' lively!

03:56.869 --> 04:01.440
There they be, Smee!
Tick Tock Tomatoes!

04:01.442 --> 04:05.544
Ah! I can almost smell
them frying now.

04:05.546 --> 04:10.449
Yes, cap'n. But since
this is Crocodile Creek,

04:10.451 --> 04:14.319
I'm wonderin'
where is the...

04:14.321 --> 04:16.188
- [mumbling]
- [gasps]

04:16.190 --> 04:20.726
- [Smee] Tick Tock Croc!
- [laughs]

04:21.594 --> 04:23.629
[belches]

04:23.631 --> 04:25.564
[yawns]

04:26.799 --> 04:29.201
- [snoring]
- Oh, dear!

04:29.203 --> 04:32.504
How will we get the tomatoes
without waking him up?

04:32.506 --> 04:35.707
Just follow me, Smee.
Beast or no beast,

04:35.709 --> 04:39.211
I must get those tomatoes!

04:39.213 --> 04:41.213
[snoring]

04:44.517 --> 04:47.486
[chuckles] Hello,
Mr. O' Dile!

04:47.488 --> 04:49.688
[yelling]

04:51.924 --> 04:55.427
Tick Tock Tomatoes,
dead ahead!

04:55.429 --> 04:57.696
Hey! Where's Tick Tock Croc?

04:57.698 --> 05:00.999
- [chuckling]
- Here he comes now!

05:01.001 --> 05:04.303
- What are we gonna do?
- I've got an idea.

05:04.305 --> 05:08.273
You guys pick the rest of the
tomatoes while I distract him.

05:08.275 --> 05:11.076
Hiya, Tick Tock.
Check this out!

05:12.211 --> 05:13.679
[squeals]

05:13.681 --> 05:16.448
You like it,
don't ya, big guy?

05:16.450 --> 05:18.317
[laughs]

05:18.319 --> 05:20.452
There!
That's the last of 'em!

05:20.454 --> 05:23.955
- [chuckling]
- Thank you! Thank you!

05:23.957 --> 05:27.592
You've been a great crowd!
And for your reward...

05:29.662 --> 05:33.532
Good goin'!
We distracted Tick Tock Croc.

05:33.534 --> 05:37.269
We got our tomatoes,
and we got two gold doubloons!

05:37.271 --> 05:40.872
Let's grab 'em and go get the
Lava Beans at Belch Mountain!

05:44.944 --> 05:47.679
Oh, dear!
The tomatoes are gone!

05:47.681 --> 05:49.881
The croc must've
eaten them all!

05:49.883 --> 05:55.287
Oh, Mama's counting on me
to bring home the tomatoes!

05:55.289 --> 05:57.456
Oh, it's not your fault, cap'n.

05:57.458 --> 06:00.859
But we can still bring back
Lava Beans and a Jumpin' Pumpkin

06:00.861 --> 06:03.995
- for your mama's meal.
- Right you are, Smee!

06:03.997 --> 06:08.633
Then it's on
to Belch Mountain!

06:08.635 --> 06:11.503
- [mountain belching]
- [Hook] Good work, Smee.

06:11.505 --> 06:14.539
Your shortcut got us here
in record time.

06:14.541 --> 06:18.377
Why, thank you, cap'n.
Oh, look!

06:18.379 --> 06:20.979
Those are Lava Beans
growing up ahead!

06:20.981 --> 06:24.616
Hurry, Smee!
Let's pick each and every one!

06:24.618 --> 06:26.685
Do be careful, cap'n!

06:26.687 --> 06:28.787
[both grunting]

06:28.789 --> 06:31.456
- [crashing]
- [moaning]

06:32.458 --> 06:34.993
Poor cap'n. Allow me!

06:34.995 --> 06:38.029
[both straining, grunting]

06:41.167 --> 06:44.302
- [yelling]
- [Hook] Lava!

06:44.304 --> 06:45.937
- Oh, dear!
- [yelling]

06:45.939 --> 06:48.940
[Hook] Save me!

06:48.942 --> 06:51.777
Ahoy, Captain Hook.
What are you doin' here?

06:51.779 --> 06:53.812
None of your business.

06:53.814 --> 06:57.349
Now if you don't mind,
go away!

06:57.351 --> 06:59.551
Or maybe you could
lend us a hand?

06:59.553 --> 07:02.487
Just hold still.
We'll help you!

07:02.489 --> 07:06.625
Mateys, we can put this rock
over the hot lava like a bridge.

07:06.627 --> 07:08.593
Come on! Help us move it!

07:08.595 --> 07:12.030
[all straining]

07:13.833 --> 07:16.535
There you go.
Be careful climbing over.

07:16.537 --> 07:19.004
Oh, thank you, sea pups.

07:19.006 --> 07:21.606
Yay-hey!
We helped Hook and Smee,

07:21.608 --> 07:24.009
and we got three more
gold doubloons.

07:24.011 --> 07:25.710
Let's grab 'em and go!

07:26.612 --> 07:27.646
Come on, sir.

07:27.648 --> 07:29.648
Don't rush me, Smee!

07:29.650 --> 07:31.516
Got every bean.

07:31.518 --> 07:35.554
Woo-hoo! It's on to the
Pirate Pumpkin Patch!

07:35.556 --> 07:39.257
Goodbye, Captain Hook!
See ya later, Mr. Smee!

07:39.259 --> 07:42.027
Thank you again, sea pups!

07:42.029 --> 07:46.431
[gasps] The beans!
They're gone!

07:46.433 --> 07:50.635
Oh, alas, no tomatoes!
No beans!

07:50.637 --> 07:54.806
I'll never get to taste me
mum's Never Land Feast meal!

07:54.808 --> 07:59.878
Oh, but we can still have
a tasty Jumpin' Pumpkin Pie.

07:59.880 --> 08:03.482
- You do love it so.
- Aye, Smee.

08:03.484 --> 08:06.618
We'll go to the
Pirate Pumpkin Patch.

08:06.620 --> 08:11.890
I'll have me dessert
if it's the last thing I do.

08:13.659 --> 08:16.928
The Jumpin' Pumpkin!
Thar she goes!

08:16.930 --> 08:20.298
After it, mateys!
It's the only one in the patch!

08:20.300 --> 08:22.267
I've got it!

08:22.269 --> 08:24.636
[laughing] Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

08:24.638 --> 08:27.305
Hang on, Cubby!
We're comin'!

08:27.307 --> 08:29.608
- [both grunt]
- [Izzy] Phew!

08:29.610 --> 08:31.943
It won't get away now!

08:31.945 --> 08:34.880
Way-hey! We got everything:

08:34.882 --> 08:39.651
Tick Tock Tomatoes, Lava Beans
and a Jumpin' Pumpkin!

08:39.653 --> 08:43.889
Hear that, Smee? They have
everything we're after.

08:43.891 --> 08:48.460
Mm, I can almost taste
the Shipwreck Stew.

08:48.462 --> 08:52.430
- Huh?
- It appears I've caught
something tasty indeed!

08:52.432 --> 08:56.601
Ta-ta! I really must be running.

08:56.603 --> 08:59.437
Smee! Save me!

08:59.439 --> 09:04.042
[choking] Cranberry... bog!

09:04.044 --> 09:06.177
This is an emergency!

09:06.179 --> 09:08.480
Izzy! You heard the captain!

09:08.482 --> 09:11.182
Pixie Dust away!

09:12.285 --> 09:14.553
- Ah!
- Yay-hey!

09:14.555 --> 09:19.491
We helped Captain Hook
out of the bog, and we got
three more gold doubloons!

09:19.493 --> 09:21.526
Let's grab 'em and go!

09:21.528 --> 09:23.962
And let's grab our stuff, too!

09:23.964 --> 09:27.198
[Hook moaning]

09:27.200 --> 09:30.468
Poor cap'n!
You're boggy to the bone!

09:30.470 --> 09:33.438
[moaning]
What does it matter?

09:33.440 --> 09:37.776
Now I'll never get even a single
bite of my mama's cooking!

09:37.778 --> 09:41.313
- What do you mean?
- Well, not that you would care,

09:41.315 --> 09:45.050
but I set out to get
Tick Tock Tomatoes, Lava Beans

09:45.052 --> 09:48.486
and a Jumpin' Pumpkin
for my mama.

09:48.488 --> 09:52.157
But I've failed to get her
a single thing!

09:52.159 --> 09:56.461
You see, Mama Hook
is planning to make
a Never Land Feast Day meal

09:56.463 --> 09:59.130
of all the captain's
favorite things.

09:59.132 --> 10:03.201
Wow! Hook's looking
for the same stuff we were.

10:03.203 --> 10:05.637
I don't know
if I could enjoy our meal

10:05.639 --> 10:08.173
knowing Hook's crew
won't have theirs.

10:08.175 --> 10:12.677
Ah! Even I feel sorry
for ol' Feather Hat... a little.

10:14.780 --> 10:18.483
Here, Captain Hook. You can
have our stuff. All of it.

10:18.485 --> 10:20.852
No! Really?

10:20.854 --> 10:24.522
Well, all I can say is...

10:24.524 --> 10:26.625
...I'll take it!

10:26.627 --> 10:28.994
Have a great
Never Land Feast Day!

10:28.996 --> 10:31.463
Say "ahoy" to your mum from us!

10:31.465 --> 10:35.467
You know, cap'n, we should do
something nice for the sea pups.

10:35.469 --> 10:38.303
After all,
they gave us their food.

10:38.305 --> 10:41.906
Not now, Smee.
Mummy's waiting!

10:43.776 --> 10:47.178
Thanks for helping us on our
Never Land Feast Day, mateys.

10:47.180 --> 10:51.583
Now let's put all our
gold doubloons into our
Team Treasure Chest.

10:58.958 --> 11:01.326
<i>¶ Way, hey</i>
<i>Well done, crew ¶</i>

11:01.328 --> 11:03.361
<i>¶ Everyone knew</i>
<i>just what to do ¶</i>

11:03.363 --> 11:05.530
<i>¶ Way, hey</i>
<i>with help from you ¶</i>

11:05.532 --> 11:08.266
<i>¶ It's time to count</i>
<i>our gold doubloons ¶</i>

11:08.268 --> 11:10.502
Come on, count with us!

11:11.637 --> 11:13.071
[all] Yeah!

11:14.540 --> 11:16.508
[Jake] One, two...

11:16.510 --> 11:18.610
[Cubby] Three, four, five...

11:18.612 --> 11:21.279
[Izzy] Six, seven, eight.

11:21.281 --> 11:24.683
[Jake] Yo-ho! For solving
Pirate Problems today,

11:24.685 --> 11:27.886
we got eight gold doubloons!

11:27.888 --> 11:29.821
That's not all we got.

11:29.823 --> 11:33.491
We just got a message in a
bottle that washed ashore.

11:33.493 --> 11:37.662
It's an invitation...
from Captain Hook!

11:40.533 --> 11:44.969
Let us all raise a glass
of this fine Pirate Punch

11:44.971 --> 11:48.306
to give thanks
to the puny pi...

11:48.308 --> 11:51.710
I mean, to Jake and his crew,

11:51.712 --> 11:55.613
for providing the food
for this delicious meal.

11:55.615 --> 11:58.016
- Here's to you!
- Cheers!

11:58.018 --> 12:02.187
- Mazel tov!
- That was really nice of you,
Captain Hook.

12:02.189 --> 12:05.657
Just remember, lad,
it's Never Land Feast Day.

12:05.659 --> 12:09.327
Only expect it once a year!

12:09.329 --> 12:13.064
- [all laugh]
- Oh, James!

12:16.168 --> 12:19.537
<i>[Jake]</i> Captain Flynn's
New Matey.

12:19.539 --> 12:21.773
[Cubby] This way!
We're getting close!

12:21.775 --> 12:25.844
According to my map,
what we're looking for is...

12:25.846 --> 12:27.378
...right here!

12:27.380 --> 12:31.149
The legendary Never Land
See-Saw! You found it!

12:31.151 --> 12:32.650
Let's shove off, mateys!

12:32.652 --> 12:35.453
No one's better with a map
than you, Cubby.

12:35.455 --> 12:37.188
- Yeah!
- All right!

12:37.190 --> 12:38.656
- Whoo-hoo!
- Goin' up!

12:38.658 --> 12:41.760
- Hang on, me hearties!
- Going down!

12:41.762 --> 12:43.928
- Going... Huh?
- [thudding]

12:43.930 --> 12:45.663
- [all] Camille?!
- Huh!

12:45.665 --> 12:48.266
What's Captain Flynn's
camel doing here?

12:48.268 --> 12:51.936
- Whoa!
- [squeals]

12:51.938 --> 12:54.806
[laughs]
Good to see you, too, Camille!

12:54.808 --> 12:58.510
- Hey, is this note for us?
- Cool. What's it say?

12:58.512 --> 13:00.779
"Ahoy, Cubby. Help!

13:00.781 --> 13:06.651
I found some puzzling treasure
maps to a cup called the
Enchanted Golden Goblet.

13:06.653 --> 13:10.655
I be needin' a skilled
map-reader to help me
figure them out.

13:10.657 --> 13:13.424
Your desert matey,
Captain Flynn."

13:13.426 --> 13:17.595
Crackers! Cubby's just
the pirate for that job!

13:17.597 --> 13:23.268
Will you come help
Captain Flynn and me find
the Enchanted Golden Goblet?

13:24.804 --> 13:28.339
Great! Remember to keep a
lookout for gold doubloons.

13:28.341 --> 13:31.776
Whenever we solve
a Pirate Problem together,
they'll appear.

13:31.778 --> 13:35.313
Then we'll collect 'em
and put 'em in our
Team Treasure Chest.

13:35.315 --> 13:38.883
- [squeals]
- Yo-ho, let's go!

13:42.521 --> 13:45.523
<i>¶ Yo-ho, mateys, away! </i>

13:45.525 --> 13:48.092
<i>¶ There'll be treasure</i>
<i>and adventure today ¶</i>

13:48.094 --> 13:49.527
<i>¶ Let's go </i>

13:49.529 --> 13:52.697
<i>¶ Heave ho, here we go</i>
<i>Together as a team ¶</i>

13:52.699 --> 13:55.867
<i>¶ Jake and the</i>
<i>Never Land Pirates ¶</i>

13:55.869 --> 13:57.769
<i>¶ And me </i>

14:00.005 --> 14:03.508
Thanks for the ride, Camille!
The desert's right up ahead.

14:03.510 --> 14:05.710
- And the sooner we get there...
- [Hook grunts]

14:05.712 --> 14:11.182
...the sooner we can help
Captain Flynn find the
Enchanted Golden Goblet!

14:11.184 --> 14:16.120
Oh, dear, cap'n,
perhaps we should stop
hiding in the underbrush.

14:16.122 --> 14:19.691
Nonsense! How else would we
know Flynn is after treasure?

14:19.693 --> 14:23.161
Imagine,
a cup of pure gold!

14:23.163 --> 14:26.931
Follow... that... camel!

14:28.601 --> 14:30.635
<i>¶ Have you heard</i>
<i>of Captain Flynn? ¶</i>

14:30.637 --> 14:32.470
<i>¶ Who hasn't heard</i>
<i>of Captain Flynn? ¶</i>

14:32.472 --> 14:35.139
<i>¶ They say he sailed</i>
<i>on every sea ¶</i>

14:35.141 --> 14:37.375
<i>¶ A friend to every</i>
<i>mate he meets ¶</i>

14:37.377 --> 14:39.477
<i>¶ I hear he sailed</i>
<i>to the South Pole twice ¶</i>

14:39.479 --> 14:42.347
<i>¶ For a salty dog</i>
<i>He's very nice ¶</i>

14:42.349 --> 14:44.682
<i>¶ Have you heard</i>
<i>of Captain Flynn? ¶</i>

14:44.684 --> 14:47.518
<i>¶ The legendary</i>
<i>Captain Flynn ¶</i>

14:49.288 --> 14:52.790
[Flynn] Aw, mateys, thank
the four winds you're here!

14:52.792 --> 14:55.493
I'm on the trail of treasure!

14:55.495 --> 14:59.764
Ancient desert legends tell
of an Enchanted Golden Goblet!

14:59.766 --> 15:02.000
[Cubby] How do we find it,
Captain Flynn?

15:02.002 --> 15:07.305
Well, Cubby, I recently
found these three maps
rolled up together.

15:07.307 --> 15:12.877
The first map shows a path
from me Pirate Pyramid
to Hourglass Falls.

15:12.879 --> 15:16.714
The second map shows the way
through Toppling Rock Canyon.

15:16.716 --> 15:20.184
And this third map shows
the way into Maze Cave.

15:20.186 --> 15:22.353
[Skully] And that's
where the treasure is!

15:22.355 --> 15:26.624
- The Golden Goblet!
- Aye.

15:26.626 --> 15:30.528
Somehow these three maps will
show us the way to the treasure.

15:30.530 --> 15:33.665
They don't go side
by side like this.

15:33.667 --> 15:35.800
None of the trails line up!

15:35.802 --> 15:39.470
'Tis true,
that won't lead us anywhere!

15:39.472 --> 15:43.308
How about if we overlap
the maps, like this,

15:43.310 --> 15:46.878
so that we create one
continuous trail!

15:46.880 --> 15:49.781
Drifting sands, you did it!

15:49.783 --> 15:52.617
I knew you'd be
a great map-matey!

15:52.619 --> 15:56.821
At last, the Enchanted Golden
Goblet is within reach!

15:56.823 --> 16:00.458
Legend says it's always
filled with water.

16:00.460 --> 16:05.463
Pour it out, and shimmerin'
oasis, it's full again!

16:05.465 --> 16:09.634
Just wait until I get me hooks
on that Golden Goblet.

16:09.636 --> 16:14.339
I'll never be thirsty again,
and I'll be rich!

16:14.341 --> 16:16.107
[all shouting]

16:16.109 --> 16:19.210
Blast!
Follow that rolling ship!

16:21.180 --> 16:24.449
[Cubby] The map says to sail
around Half-Moon Dune, cap'n!

16:24.451 --> 16:26.951
Aye, aye, navigator Cubby.

16:26.953 --> 16:29.954
Ahoy, me hearties,
we've got company!

16:29.956 --> 16:33.591
Ol' Feather Hat's hot on our
tail in his Hook-mobile!

16:33.593 --> 16:38.096
- Faster, Smee!
- Aye. Hook's the least
of our worries!

16:38.098 --> 16:42.266
A sandstorm's rollin' in. We've
got to get out of the open!

16:42.268 --> 16:45.536
Maybe we can hide
from Hook and the storm.

16:45.538 --> 16:50.608
Head for Hourglass Falls!
The map shows a cave
behind the falling sand!

16:50.610 --> 16:54.612
Right you are, Cubby!
Hang on, mateys!

16:56.382 --> 16:58.683
Oh, dear, cap'n,
those dark clouds

16:58.685 --> 17:02.720
- don't look very good at all.
- And we lost the popinjays!

17:02.722 --> 17:05.623
Lost the pop...
No, we haven't!

17:05.625 --> 17:09.360
Look! In the sand!
Wheel tracks!

17:09.362 --> 17:11.929
Push on, Mr. Smee!

17:11.931 --> 17:14.232
Full speed head!

17:16.502 --> 17:18.336
- Sandstorm!
- [all shouting]

17:18.338 --> 17:21.506
- [crashing]
- [grunting]

17:21.508 --> 17:23.107
Look!

17:24.643 --> 17:29.247
After them, ye swabs!
Abandon ship!

17:31.283 --> 17:33.651
Yo-ho! We did it!

17:33.653 --> 17:36.888
We avoided the sandstorm,
left Hook behind,

17:36.890 --> 17:40.591
and got three gold doubloons!
Let's grab 'em and go

17:40.593 --> 17:44.195
to the next part of our map,
Toppling Rock Canyon.

17:47.032 --> 17:51.836
- [Camille squeals]
- Shh. Quiet, please, Camille.

17:51.838 --> 17:57.542
In Toppling Rock Canyon,
even a wee sound can
cause rocks to fall.

17:58.043 --> 18:00.478
Ah... sand...

18:00.480 --> 18:02.480
...in my beak! Ah...

18:02.482 --> 18:05.950
Ah... [sneezes loudly]

18:11.457 --> 18:13.257
Gesundheit, Skully.

18:13.259 --> 18:16.494
Thanks, but, crackers,
I blocked our trail!

18:16.496 --> 18:19.263
Then we'll just have
to go over the top!

18:19.265 --> 18:24.602
I've got an idea! Quick,
everybody, get on this rock!

18:24.604 --> 18:29.640
- Mateys, ready, get set...
- [rumbling]

18:29.642 --> 18:33.511
[all shouting]

18:33.513 --> 18:36.848
- Yo-ho, way to go, mateys!
- Yeah!

18:36.850 --> 18:38.783
We got over the rock wall!

18:38.785 --> 18:41.652
And we got three more
gold doubloons!

18:41.654 --> 18:43.154
Let's grab 'em and go!

18:46.625 --> 18:49.427
We made it to Maze Cave!

18:49.429 --> 18:51.262
[Jake] Which way does
the map say to go?

18:51.264 --> 18:54.198
The map only shows
how to get to Maze Cave,

18:54.200 --> 18:56.300
not how to get through it.

18:56.302 --> 18:59.637
Look. We're here,
at the entrance.

18:59.639 --> 19:02.540
The Goblet is here,
in the center of the maze!

19:02.542 --> 19:06.043
Hm. We could get lost forever!

19:06.045 --> 19:10.882
I'll use my sense
of direction to get us
through the maze! Follow me!

19:15.787 --> 19:17.288
[Cubby] This way!

19:22.528 --> 19:26.597
- There it is!
- [Cubby] The Enchanted
Golden Goblet!

19:26.599 --> 19:31.269
Shiftin' sands, you did it,
Cubby! You found the treasure!

19:31.271 --> 19:34.005
Check it out.
There's writing.

19:34.007 --> 19:39.610
"This Golden Goblet belongs
to a true captain
of the desert sands."

19:39.612 --> 19:42.880
Captain Flynn,
that's you!

19:44.983 --> 19:48.486
Ah! It's filled
with fresh water.

19:48.488 --> 19:51.522
And the legend says
that it's always filled.

19:52.858 --> 19:55.459
[Hook] And I shall
prove it to you!

19:55.461 --> 19:57.195
[all] Captain Hook!

19:57.197 --> 19:59.597
How did you get
through the maze?

19:59.599 --> 20:03.868
Oh, t'was easy.
You left footprints in the dust!

20:03.870 --> 20:06.938
I'll take that Golden Goblet!

20:06.940 --> 20:11.542
[sputtering] Smee!

20:11.544 --> 20:13.844
- [coughing]
- Oh, dear!
Let me dry you off, cap'n.

20:13.846 --> 20:16.547
- More water!
- There's the proof.

20:16.549 --> 20:19.984
- It's enchanted, all right.
- Time to go!

20:19.986 --> 20:23.888
Skully, bring up the rear
and hide all the footprints!

20:23.890 --> 20:26.657
- Aye, aye, Jake!
- Sorry, Captain Hook,

20:26.659 --> 20:31.362
but the Golden Goblet
belongs to "a true captain
of the desert sands,"

20:31.364 --> 20:35.299
not to you.
Yo-ho, let's go!

20:35.301 --> 20:37.635
So long, you sneaky snook!

20:37.637 --> 20:39.704
And so long, footprints!

20:39.706 --> 20:43.107
- [Skully laughs]
- [coughing]

20:43.109 --> 20:47.011
After them! They've taken
what I stole from them!

20:47.013 --> 20:50.047
But sir,
the footprints, they're...

20:50.049 --> 20:53.618
- [all] Gone!
- Which way do we go, cap'n?

20:53.620 --> 20:56.354
[Hook] Uh, to the right.
No! Left!

20:56.356 --> 21:00.891
No! Straight ahead!
Run, ye swabs!

21:02.327 --> 21:05.529
We did it! We found the
Enchanted Golden Goblet,

21:05.531 --> 21:09.634
got out of the maze,
and got four more
gold doubloons!

21:09.636 --> 21:12.503
Let's grab 'em and go!

21:12.505 --> 21:16.807
Mateys, before we go,
I'd like to say thank ye,
Map Master Cubby,

21:16.809 --> 21:19.443
for all your
map-readin' help.

21:19.445 --> 21:21.012
We couldn't have done it
without ya!

21:21.014 --> 21:24.782
- Aw, coconuts!
- [all] Yo-ho, Cubby!

21:24.784 --> 21:29.387
Come on, everybody,
let's get back to Camille
over on Captain Flynn's ship!

21:29.389 --> 21:31.689
Pixie Dust away!

21:34.459 --> 21:37.361
Yo-ho, way to go, mateys!

21:37.363 --> 21:41.499
Thanks for helping
Captain Flynn find the
Enchanted Golden Goblet!

21:41.501 --> 21:45.670
Now let's put all our
gold doubloons into
our Team Treasure Chest.

21:52.978 --> 21:55.179
<i>¶ Way, hey</i>
<i>Well done, crew ¶</i>

21:55.181 --> 21:57.214
<i>¶ Everyone knew</i>
<i>just what to do ¶</i>

21:57.216 --> 21:59.283
<i>¶ Way, hey</i>
<i>with help from you ¶</i>

21:59.285 --> 22:02.153
<i>¶ It's time to count</i>
<i>our gold doubloons ¶</i>

22:02.155 --> 22:04.455
Come on, count with us!

22:05.424 --> 22:06.857
[all] Yeah!

22:06.859 --> 22:10.795
[Cubby] One, two, three...

22:10.797 --> 22:13.431
[Izzy] Four, five, six...

22:13.433 --> 22:16.967
[Jake] Seven, eight,
nine, ten!

22:16.969 --> 22:22.840
Yo-ho! For solving Pirate
Problems today, we got
ten gold doubloons!

22:23.675 --> 22:25.710
Hey, Cubby, think you can find

22:25.712 --> 22:27.778
that Never Land See-Saw again?

22:27.780 --> 22:30.881
Don't need to, Jake!
May I present,

22:30.883 --> 22:33.984
our very own
Pirate Island See-Saw!

22:33.986 --> 22:35.720
- All right!
- Yeah!

22:35.722 --> 22:38.589
- Woo-hoo!
- Knew you'd like it!

22:40.792 --> 22:44.161
[panting] Oh, dear.

22:44.163 --> 22:46.931
We'll never find our way
out of this maze.

22:46.933 --> 22:49.700
[grunts] Lookie!
A hatch.

22:49.702 --> 22:53.337
Step aside!
I shall escape first!

22:53.339 --> 22:56.507
[grunting]

22:56.509 --> 22:59.210
At last, we are free!

22:59.212 --> 23:02.980
Now, which way to the exit?

23:02.982 --> 23:05.916
[Smee] Oh, double dear.

23:13.592 --> 23:17.294
¶ To brew a batch of pirate
rock, you'll need the recipe ¶

23:17.296 --> 23:20.865
<i>¶ Here's Grandmama's</i>
<i>ingredients as handed down</i>
<i>to me ¶</i>

23:20.867 --> 23:24.468
<i>¶ You take a sailor song</i>
<i>with an old accordion ¶</i>

23:24.470 --> 23:28.506
¶ Then stew it up together
with some xylophone and drums ¶

23:28.508 --> 23:31.809
<i>¶ Stir it with guitar</i>
<i>and a dash of minor key ¶</i>

23:31.811 --> 23:37.381
¶ Then sing across the quarter
deck and send it out to sea ¶

23:37.383 --> 23:41.051
¶ Yo-ho
Sing it from the crow's nest ¶

23:41.053 --> 23:44.622
<i>¶ Yo-ho</i>
<i>X it on the spot ¶</i>

23:44.624 --> 23:48.426
<i>¶ Yo-ho</i>
<i>Rock it on the ocean ¶</i>

23:48.428 --> 23:52.696
<i>¶ That's the recipe</i>
<i>for pirate rock ¶</i>

23:52.698 --> 23:56.534
<i>¶ Just like Grandma</i>
<i>used to make it ¶</i>

23:56.536 --> 24:00.604
<i>¶ Mix it up in a galley pot </i>

24:00.606 --> 24:03.874
<i>¶ That's the recipe</i>
<i>for pirate rock ¶</i>
