WEBVTT

00:10.803 --> 00:13.761
And now he wants
a cell phone if you can believe that.

00:13.931 --> 00:15.796
Woman:
I know that look.

00:15.975 --> 00:18.341
Then you get
really quiet.

00:18.519 --> 00:20.510
So are you
gonna tell me?

00:20.688 --> 00:23.020
We had a fight this morning.
It got ugly.

00:23.191 --> 00:25.603
- Hurtful.
- I'm sorry, hon.

00:25.776 --> 00:27.312
Men can be jerks.

00:27.486 --> 00:29.738
Thing is, if we're being honest,
he wasn't the asshole.

00:29.906 --> 00:31.567
Ah, gotcha.

00:31.741 --> 00:33.823
He was trying so hard
to be reasonable,

00:33.993 --> 00:37.030
itjust pushed my buttons
all the more.

00:39.040 --> 00:41.497
God, I sometimes wish
he would just have it out with me

00:41.667 --> 00:43.498
and blow up,

00:43.669 --> 00:45.330
tell me I'm being a bitch
if that's what I'm being.

00:45.504 --> 00:48.462
Instead he's just so...
( sighs )

00:48.633 --> 00:51.875
- Don't beat yourself up.
-No?

00:52.053 --> 00:54.009
You can't tell me that being pissed
at your husband

00:54.180 --> 00:56.512
because he doesn't yell at you
is even close to being rational.

00:57.850 --> 01:00.057
That's one problem
I don't have with Tom.

01:00.228 --> 01:02.014
But you still love him.

01:02.188 --> 01:04.053
Sure I do.
Might as well.

01:04.232 --> 01:06.894
- We're lifers.
- I admire your pragmatism.

01:08.986 --> 01:10.396
You still love Rick?

01:11.906 --> 01:14.022
I've been asking myself
that a lot.

01:15.409 --> 01:16.740
And I think
the answer's yes.

01:16.911 --> 01:19.072
It's just I'm trying
to remember how that works.

01:19.247 --> 01:21.704
Maybe the only
real problem we have

01:21.874 --> 01:23.375
is we got married
so young.

01:23.542 --> 01:26.204
( siren blares )

01:29.590 --> 01:31.967
Excuse me.

01:53.447 --> 01:55.733
Is he alive?

01:55.908 --> 01:57.523
He's in surgery.

01:57.702 --> 01:59.738
(school bell rings)

01:59.912 --> 02:02.153
How?

02:04.125 --> 02:07.367
There was a radio call that said
that there was two suspects in a car.

02:07.545 --> 02:10.252
But there was a third man.
Somebody screwed up.

02:11.757 --> 02:13.543
I screwed up.

02:13.718 --> 02:17.006
I did not see him in time.
Lori, it's my fault.

02:17.179 --> 02:20.307
I don't believe that.

02:32.445 --> 02:34.777
What do I say?

02:34.947 --> 02:37.108
How do | tell my son
his father's been shot?

02:37.283 --> 02:39.524
You don't have to
do it alone.

02:41.495 --> 02:43.611
Okay.

02:49.879 --> 02:52.165
(inaudible)

03:09.023 --> 03:11.639
(theme music playing )

03:45.226 --> 03:47.933
( panting )

03:56.028 --> 03:58.770
(grunts)
Come on.

04:05.746 --> 04:08.783
Hey, you move, shithead.
Come on, get I said.

04:08.958 --> 04:10.789
How far? How far?!

04:10.960 --> 04:12.700
Another half mile that way.

04:12.878 --> 04:14.254
Hershel.

04:14.422 --> 04:16.834
Talk to Hershel.
He'll help your boy.

04:18.050 --> 04:20.166
- ( gasping )
- Come on.

04:20.344 --> 04:22.209
- I'm sorry.
- Let's go. Come on!

04:22.388 --> 04:24.595
( panting )

04:41.115 --> 04:43.071
(grunts)

04:59.925 --> 05:01.631
Dad!

05:19.028 --> 05:21.519
- Was he bit?
- Shot.

05:21.697 --> 05:23.278
- By your man.
- Otis?

05:23.449 --> 05:25.440
He said find Hershel.
Is that you?

05:25.618 --> 05:27.779
- Help me. Help my boy.
- Get him inside.

05:27.953 --> 05:30.695
Patricia, I need
my full kit.

05:30.873 --> 05:32.238
- Maggie.
- Yeah?

05:32.416 --> 05:34.532
Painkillers, coagulates--
grab everything.

05:34.710 --> 05:37.372
Clean towels,
sheets, alcohol.

05:37.546 --> 05:39.628
ln here.

05:42.134 --> 05:44.295
- Pillowcase.
- Is he alive?

05:44.470 --> 05:46.836
Pillowcase, quick.

05:47.014 --> 05:48.879
Is he alive?

05:49.058 --> 05:52.425
Fold it.
Make a pad.

05:52.603 --> 05:55.185
Put pressure
on the wound.

06:01.946 --> 06:04.153
I've got a heartbeat.

06:04.323 --> 06:06.689
- It's faint.
- I got it, step back.

06:06.867 --> 06:09.244
- Maggie, lV.
- We need some space.

06:09.411 --> 06:11.276
- Your name?
- Rick.

06:11.455 --> 06:13.320
- Rick?
- l'm-- I'm Rick.

06:13.499 --> 06:16.536
Hershel: Rick, we're gonna do
everything we can, okay?

06:16.710 --> 06:19.452
You need to give us
some room.

06:21.006 --> 06:22.997
Now.

06:29.390 --> 06:32.052
- Otis: I'm sorry.
- Shane: Move!

06:48.200 --> 06:50.532
He's alive?
He's still alive?

06:53.872 --> 06:55.703
Hey...

06:56.709 --> 06:58.324
okay.

07:00.588 --> 07:02.749
It's okay.

07:02.923 --> 07:04.333
You got blood, man.

07:09.263 --> 07:11.299
Okay.

07:12.600 --> 07:14.716
I'll take it from you.

07:14.893 --> 07:17.726
Where is he?
Where is he? Is he okay?

07:27.573 --> 07:29.154
You know his blood type?

07:29.325 --> 07:31.657
A-positive, same as mine.

07:31.827 --> 07:33.567
That's fortunate.

07:33.746 --> 07:36.158
Don't wander far.
I'm gonna need you.

07:36.332 --> 07:37.947
What happened?

07:38.125 --> 07:41.367
l was tracking a buck.

07:41.545 --> 07:43.251
Bullet went through it.

07:43.422 --> 07:44.912
Went clean through.

07:45.090 --> 07:47.706
The deer slowed
the bullet down,

07:47.885 --> 07:51.048
which certainly saved
his life.

07:51.221 --> 07:53.883
But it did not
go through clean.

07:54.058 --> 07:55.514
It broke up into pieces.

07:55.684 --> 07:57.845
If I can get the bullet
fragments out...

07:58.020 --> 07:59.476
and I'm counting six.

07:59.647 --> 08:01.478
I never saw him,

08:01.649 --> 08:05.062
not until he was
on the ground.

08:07.655 --> 08:10.192
- Lori doesn't know.
- I know.

08:11.533 --> 08:14.741
My wife doesn't know.
My wife doesn't know.

08:23.295 --> 08:25.581
You still worrying about it?

08:25.756 --> 08:27.792
It was a gunshot.

08:27.966 --> 08:29.467
Daryl:
We all heard it.

08:29.635 --> 08:32.297
Why one?
Why just one gunshot?

08:32.471 --> 08:34.632
- Maybe they took down a walker.
- Please don't patronize me.

08:34.807 --> 08:36.968
You know Rick wouldn't risk
a gunshot to put down one walker.

08:37.142 --> 08:38.302
Or Shane.
They'd do it quietly.

08:38.477 --> 08:41.310
Shouldn't they have caught up
with us by now?

08:41.480 --> 08:43.220
There's nothing we can
do about it anyway.

08:43.399 --> 08:45.185
Can't run around these
woods chasing echoes.

08:45.359 --> 08:47.645
- So what do we do?
- Same as we've been.

08:47.820 --> 08:50.277
Beat the bush for Sophia,
work our way back to the highway.

08:51.699 --> 08:53.564
I'm sure they'll hook up
with us back at the RV.

09:02.584 --> 09:05.041
I'm sorry for what
you're going through.

09:05.212 --> 09:07.999
I know how you feel.

09:08.173 --> 09:10.505
I suppose you do.

09:10.676 --> 09:12.917
Thank you.

09:13.095 --> 09:17.259
The thought of her
out here by herself...

09:18.559 --> 09:21.175
it's the not knowing
that's killing me.

09:21.353 --> 09:24.516
ljust keep hoping and praying
she doesn't wind up like Amy.

09:27.025 --> 09:28.936
Oh, God.

09:29.111 --> 09:31.853
That's the worst thing
I ever said.

09:34.116 --> 09:36.402
We're all hoping
and praying with you,

09:36.577 --> 09:38.442
for what it's worth.

09:40.038 --> 09:42.199
I'll tell you what it's worth--
not a damn thing.

09:42.374 --> 09:44.706
It's a waste of time
all this hoping and praying.

09:46.336 --> 09:48.042
'Cause we're gonna
locate that little girl,

09:48.213 --> 09:50.545
she's gonna be just fine.

09:50.716 --> 09:52.957
Am I the only one
zen around here?

09:53.135 --> 09:54.375
Good Lord.

10:02.561 --> 10:05.519
( ratcheting )

10:16.867 --> 10:19.950
We are gonna have quite
a collection of spare parts, | tell ya.

10:20.120 --> 10:22.406
Shouldn't they
be back by now?

10:22.581 --> 10:24.742
It's still light.

10:24.917 --> 10:28.000
Let's not worry just yet.

10:29.588 --> 10:31.624
How are you feeling?

10:41.934 --> 10:43.299
T-Dog?

10:44.561 --> 10:46.768
| asked you how you
were feeling just now.

10:46.939 --> 10:49.180
Please don't blow
that question off.

10:49.358 --> 10:52.065
It really, really hurts.

10:52.236 --> 10:54.022
lt's throbbing
something awful.

10:54.196 --> 10:56.778
Oh, let me see.

11:05.791 --> 11:07.531
Ah! Don't--
don't touch it!

11:07.709 --> 11:09.665
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

11:09.837 --> 11:13.546
Listen, your veins
are very discolored.

11:13.715 --> 11:15.671
You got a hell
of an infection there.

11:15.843 --> 11:16.582
You could die
from blood poisoning.

11:16.593 --> 11:17.548
You could die
from blood poisoning.

11:17.719 --> 11:20.051
( laughs)

11:20.222 --> 11:21.962
Oh, man.

11:22.140 --> 11:24.392
Wouldn't that
be the way?

11:24.560 --> 11:25.845
World gone to hell,

11:26.019 --> 11:28.635
the dead risen up
to eat the living

11:28.814 --> 11:30.850
and Theodore Douglas

11:31.024 --> 11:33.310
gets done in by
a cut on his arm.

11:33.485 --> 11:35.567
Yeah, that would be--
that would be stupid.

11:35.737 --> 11:37.728
I've been saying
since yesterday,

11:37.906 --> 11:40.318
we've got to get you
some antibiotics.

11:40.492 --> 11:43.655
We've been ransacking
these cars the whole time.

11:43.829 --> 11:46.161
I can't believe that we have
not found some ampicillin

11:46.331 --> 11:49.744
or something in the whole place.
Can you?

11:49.918 --> 11:52.876
Seems like
there would be.

11:53.046 --> 11:54.627
That's what I think.

11:54.798 --> 11:56.914
Well,

11:57.092 --> 11:59.174
we, uh--

11:59.344 --> 12:01.005
we haven't been
thorough enough.

12:01.179 --> 12:03.340
So let's look some more.

12:37.883 --> 12:41.546
(shudders)

12:43.889 --> 12:47.473
( clock ticking )

12:51.355 --> 12:54.188
Why'd I let him
come with us?

12:54.358 --> 12:57.475
I should have sent him
with Lori.

12:57.653 --> 12:59.644
You know,
you start that,

12:59.821 --> 13:03.063
you'll never get that monkey
off your back.

13:05.535 --> 13:08.618
Little girl goes missing,
you look for her.

13:08.789 --> 13:10.996
Simple.

13:11.166 --> 13:13.122
You said call it,
head back.

13:13.293 --> 13:14.499
Doesn't matter
what I said.

13:14.670 --> 13:16.831
Carl got shot because
I wouldn't cut bait.

13:17.005 --> 13:18.666
It should be me in there.

13:18.840 --> 13:20.876
( chuckles )

13:21.051 --> 13:23.588
You've been there, partner.

13:23.762 --> 13:25.627
Right?

13:25.806 --> 13:29.173
And you pulled through.
So will he.

13:29.351 --> 13:32.218
Is that why I got out
of that hospital?

13:32.396 --> 13:34.978
Found my family
for it to end here like this?

13:35.148 --> 13:37.605
This some kind
of sick joke?

13:37.776 --> 13:39.562
You stop it.

13:39.736 --> 13:42.148
Just stop.

13:43.949 --> 13:46.656
A little girl
goes missing...

13:49.496 --> 13:52.112
youlookforhen
lt's plain and simple.

13:55.293 --> 13:58.626
- ( door opens)
- Rick.

13:58.797 --> 14:01.664
- He needs blood.
- ( Carl crying, groaning)

14:01.842 --> 14:04.003
You, hold him down.

14:05.387 --> 14:07.969
- Carl: Dad!
- Shane: I got him.

14:10.142 --> 14:11.177
( screams )

14:11.351 --> 14:13.842
Almost there.

14:14.021 --> 14:16.808
- ( screams)
- Stop! You're killing him!

14:16.982 --> 14:18.392
Rick, do you want
him to live?

14:18.567 --> 14:20.307
(crying)

14:20.485 --> 14:22.601
Patricia:
He needs blood.

14:22.779 --> 14:24.519
Do it now!

14:29.161 --> 14:31.322
(grunts)

14:34.958 --> 14:37.540
(crying stops)

14:39.337 --> 14:41.498
Wait. Wait. Hey.

14:41.673 --> 14:44.050
He just passed out.

14:53.852 --> 14:56.969
One down...

14:57.147 --> 14:58.478
(shrapnel clinks)

14:58.648 --> 15:00.639
five to go.

15:05.072 --> 15:07.063
(air pumping)

15:10.827 --> 15:13.239
(air hissing)

15:18.168 --> 15:20.705
Pressure's stable.

15:23.215 --> 15:24.375
Lori needs to be here.

15:24.549 --> 15:26.414
She doesn't even know
what's going on.

15:26.593 --> 15:28.129
I've got to go find her.
Bring her back.

15:28.303 --> 15:31.215
- You can't do that.
- She's his mother.

15:31.389 --> 15:33.050
She needs to know
what's happened.

15:33.225 --> 15:34.556
Her son's lying here shot.

15:34.726 --> 15:37.012
And he's going to need
more blood.

15:37.187 --> 15:40.896
He can't go more than
50 feet from this bed.

15:44.569 --> 15:46.355
Hey. Hey.

15:46.530 --> 15:49.567
- Come on.
- I'm all right.

15:49.741 --> 15:51.777
- I'm all right.
- I got him.

16:02.170 --> 16:04.502
He's stable for now.

16:07.092 --> 16:09.754
Lori has to be here
Shane, she has to know.

16:09.928 --> 16:12.385
Okay, I get that.

16:12.556 --> 16:14.217
I'm gonna handle it.

16:14.391 --> 16:16.097
But you've got
to handle your end.

16:16.268 --> 16:18.429
My-- my end?

16:18.603 --> 16:21.595
Your end is being here
for your son.

16:21.773 --> 16:24.856
Even if he didn't need
your blood to survive,

16:25.026 --> 16:27.938
there is no way I'd ever
let you walk out that door.

16:28.113 --> 16:30.946
Man, l'd break your legs
if you tried.

16:31.116 --> 16:32.526
You know that, right?

16:35.954 --> 16:39.287
If something happened to him
and you weren't here...

16:42.460 --> 16:45.293
if-- if he slipped away

16:45.463 --> 16:47.670
while you were gone,

16:47.841 --> 16:50.378
you would never
forgive yourself for that.

16:50.552 --> 16:52.588
And neither
would Lori, man.

17:00.395 --> 17:02.977
You're right.

17:03.148 --> 17:05.139
When was I ever wrong?

17:05.317 --> 17:07.603
( laughs)

17:12.324 --> 17:14.189
You know, when--

17:15.744 --> 17:18.360
when you were
in that hospital,

17:18.538 --> 17:20.494
the one you were
never supposed to leave,

17:20.665 --> 17:24.908
man, you should have
seen Lori.

17:28.173 --> 17:30.164
She was like...

17:32.135 --> 17:34.171
the strength
of that woman...

17:34.346 --> 17:38.339
( laughs)
you can't imagine it.

17:38.516 --> 17:41.303
See-- see that's what
you've got to have now.

17:41.478 --> 17:45.437
I mean, Carl--
he needs that from you.

17:45.607 --> 17:47.814
So you wire yourself
tight, my friend.

17:47.984 --> 17:50.316
-Hmm?
- You hear?

17:50.487 --> 17:52.648
You've got the hard part.

17:52.822 --> 17:54.858
Just leave the rest
to me, okay?

17:55.033 --> 17:56.489
- All right.
- All right.

17:57.494 --> 17:59.985
( door opens)

18:02.123 --> 18:04.375
He's out of danger
for the moment.

18:04.542 --> 18:07.625
But I need to remove those
remaining fragments.

18:07.796 --> 18:09.457
How?
You saw how he was.

18:09.631 --> 18:11.838
I know, and that was
the shallowest one.

18:12.008 --> 18:14.294
I need to go deeper
to get the others.

18:14.469 --> 18:16.380
- Shane: Oh, man.
- There's more.

18:16.554 --> 18:18.260
Tell me.

18:18.431 --> 18:20.888
His belly's distended,
his pressure is dropping,

18:21.059 --> 18:23.175
which means there's
internal bleeding.

18:23.353 --> 18:26.345
A fragment must have nicked
one of the blood vessels.

18:29.234 --> 18:32.601
l have to open him up,
find the bleeder and stitch it.

18:32.779 --> 18:35.020
And he can't move
while I'm in there--

18:35.198 --> 18:36.654
I mean, at all.

18:36.825 --> 18:38.941
If he reacts
the same as before,

18:39.119 --> 18:41.986
l'll sever an artery
and he'll be dead in minutes.

18:44.791 --> 18:47.999
To even try this,
l have to put him under.

18:48.169 --> 18:49.875
But if I do,

18:50.046 --> 18:52.628
he won't be able
to breathe on his own.

18:52.799 --> 18:55.085
Same bad results.

18:56.886 --> 18:59.753
- What'll it take?
- You need a respirator.

18:59.931 --> 19:03.048
- What else?
- The tube that goes with it,

19:03.226 --> 19:06.309
extra surgical supplies,
drapes, sutures.

19:06.479 --> 19:08.435
If you had all that
you could save him?

19:08.606 --> 19:11.097
If I had all that,
I could try.

19:11.276 --> 19:13.767
Nearest hospital went up
in flames a month ago.

19:13.945 --> 19:16.903
- The high school.
- That's what I was thinking.

19:17.073 --> 19:19.155
They set up
a FEMA shelter there.

19:19.326 --> 19:21.066
They would have
everything we need.

19:21.244 --> 19:22.825
Otis: Place was overrun
last time I saw it.

19:22.996 --> 19:25.908
You couldn't get near it.
Maybe it's better now.

19:27.751 --> 19:30.288
I said, leave the rest to me.

19:30.462 --> 19:32.544
Is it too late
to take that back?

19:32.547 --> 19:33.252
Is it too late
to take that back?

19:33.423 --> 19:35.209
I hate you going alone.

19:35.383 --> 19:36.714
Come on.

19:36.885 --> 19:40.423
Doc, why don't you do me
a list and draw me a map?

19:40.597 --> 19:43.930
You won't need a map.
I'll take you there.

19:45.435 --> 19:47.471
- Ain't but five miles.
- Otis, no.

19:47.645 --> 19:50.808
Honey, we don't have time for
guesswork and I'm responsible.

19:50.982 --> 19:53.815
I ain't gonna sit here while this fella
takes this on alone.

19:55.737 --> 19:58.570
- I'll be all right.
- Are you sure about this?

19:58.740 --> 20:01.698
You even know what any of the stuff
he's talking about looks like?

20:01.868 --> 20:04.029
- Come to think, no.
- I've been a volunteer EMT.

20:04.204 --> 20:05.785
I do.

20:05.955 --> 20:07.570
We can talk about this
till next Sunday

20:07.749 --> 20:09.080
or we could just
go do it real quick.

20:09.250 --> 20:10.660
I'll take right quick.

20:10.835 --> 20:12.371
I should thank you.

20:12.545 --> 20:14.661
Wait till that boy of yours
is up and around.

20:14.839 --> 20:17.706
Then we'll talk.
l'll gather some things.

20:20.512 --> 20:23.629
Where is she,
your wife?

20:32.023 --> 20:33.809
We'll lose the light
before too long.

20:33.983 --> 20:36.474
- I think we should call it.
- Let's head back.

20:36.653 --> 20:38.564
We'll pick it up
again tomorrow?

20:38.738 --> 20:41.525
Yeah, we'll
find her tomorrow.

20:41.699 --> 20:44.111
( Daryl whistles )

20:54.546 --> 20:57.208
Just get what you need
and get out of there.

20:57.382 --> 21:00.294
You stay strong,
all right?

21:11.938 --> 21:13.394
That's a fine weapon, Rick.

21:13.565 --> 21:15.556
I'll bring it back
in good shape.

21:18.069 --> 21:20.060
( taps )

21:33.585 --> 21:36.247
Only one I got.

21:37.297 --> 21:38.833
(engine starts)

21:39.007 --> 21:41.419
Man, this turned into
one strange day.

21:41.593 --> 21:44.585
Didn't it though?

21:58.610 --> 22:01.272
Let's check on your boy.

22:08.161 --> 22:10.618
Found some more batteries,

22:11.915 --> 22:15.533
a bottle of very trendy
pink water,

22:16.920 --> 22:19.662
an excellent new machete,

22:19.839 --> 22:22.672
and I thought Glenn
might like this guitar.

22:22.842 --> 22:25.675
Maybe he plays.

22:29.390 --> 22:32.723
No drugs.
You?

22:33.811 --> 22:37.645
Yeah, ibuprofen and these.

22:41.569 --> 22:43.651
What are we doing?

22:43.821 --> 22:47.063
Pulling supplies together.

22:47.242 --> 22:49.324
No, I mean...

22:49.494 --> 22:51.826
what are we doing?

22:52.956 --> 22:54.787
People off in the woods,

22:54.958 --> 22:57.870
they's looking for that
poor girl and we're here.

22:58.044 --> 23:00.160
Why?

23:02.590 --> 23:05.002
'Cause they think
we're the weakest.

23:08.513 --> 23:11.004
What are you, 70?

23:11.182 --> 23:14.219
- 64.
- Uh-huh.

23:15.645 --> 23:17.727
And I'm the one
black guy.

23:17.897 --> 23:20.764
Realize how precarious
that makes my situation?

23:20.942 --> 23:23.558
What the hell
are you talking about?

23:26.030 --> 23:29.363
I'm talking about two good-old-boy
cowboy sheriffs

23:29.534 --> 23:31.525
and a redneck whose brother
cut off his own hand

23:31.703 --> 23:33.364
because I dropped a key.

23:35.081 --> 23:37.697
Who in that scenario you think
is gonna be first to get lynched?

23:37.875 --> 23:39.740
You can't be serious.

23:39.919 --> 23:43.161
Am |-- hey,
am I missing something?

23:43.339 --> 23:46.331
Those cowboys have
done all right by us.

23:46.509 --> 23:49.046
And if I'm not mistaken,
that redneck went out of his way

23:49.220 --> 23:52.587
to save your ass--
more than once.

23:52.765 --> 23:55.051
And don't forget
about Andrea.

23:55.226 --> 23:56.762
Kills her own sister.

23:56.936 --> 23:59.018
She was already dead.

23:59.188 --> 24:02.100
Then wants to
blow herself up.

24:02.275 --> 24:05.483
Yeah, she's all there.

24:05.653 --> 24:08.065
She's having a tough time.
What is wrong with you?

24:08.239 --> 24:10.571
The whole world
is having a tough time.

24:10.742 --> 24:13.233
Damn, man.
Open your eyes.

24:13.411 --> 24:14.992
( yelling )
Look where we are--

24:15.163 --> 24:17.404
- stuck in this mess here!
- Shh!

24:20.752 --> 24:23.539
Let's-- let's just go.

24:23.713 --> 24:27.126
Let's just take the RV.

24:28.760 --> 24:30.876
- You've gone off the deep end.
- I mean it, man.

24:31.054 --> 24:33.670
Why are we on the side
of this road like live bait?

24:35.558 --> 24:38.220
Let's go, you and me.

24:40.355 --> 24:42.767
Let's go
before they get back.

24:48.279 --> 24:51.521
Oh, my God.
You're burning up.

24:51.699 --> 24:53.690
Give me that.

24:53.868 --> 24:55.654
Come on.

24:58.122 --> 25:00.784
Here, take these.

25:00.958 --> 25:03.085
We've got to knock
that fever down.

25:05.588 --> 25:07.453
Here.

25:14.263 --> 25:16.925
Where the hell are they?

25:19.852 --> 25:21.558
How much farther?

25:21.729 --> 25:24.471
Not much.
Maybe 100 yards

25:24.649 --> 25:26.731
as the crow flies.

25:26.901 --> 25:29.643
Too bad we're not crows.

25:39.747 --> 25:41.408
Oh.

25:41.582 --> 25:43.959
Oh!

25:49.215 --> 25:51.581
As the crow flies, my ass.

25:51.759 --> 25:54.501
- ( growling )
- ( screams)

25:54.679 --> 25:57.341
- ( Andrea screaming )
- Andrea?

25:57.515 --> 26:00.097
(screaming )

26:06.858 --> 26:09.850
(screaming )
Help me!

26:12.488 --> 26:13.864
(snarling )

26:26.961 --> 26:29.543
Lori? Lori Grimes?
Whoa.

26:29.714 --> 26:31.705
- l'm Lori.
- Rick sent me.

26:31.883 --> 26:33.043
- You've got to come now.
- What?

26:33.217 --> 26:35.208
There's been an accident.
Carl's been shot.

26:35.386 --> 26:38.469
He's still alive
but you've got to come now.

26:38.639 --> 26:40.095
Rick needs you.
Just come.

26:40.266 --> 26:43.053
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
We don't know this girl.

26:43.227 --> 26:44.763
You can't get
on that horse.

26:44.937 --> 26:47.394
Rick said you had others on
the highway, that big traffic snarl?

26:47.565 --> 26:49.430
- Uh-huh.
- Backtrack to Fairburn Road.

26:49.609 --> 26:51.349
Two miles down is our farm.
You'll see the mailbox.

26:51.527 --> 26:53.392
The name is Greene.
Hyah!

26:59.577 --> 27:02.819
( wheezing )

27:02.997 --> 27:04.988
Shut up.

27:17.929 --> 27:20.921
Shot?
What do you mean shot?

27:21.098 --> 27:23.350
I don't know, Dale.
I wasn't there.

27:23.518 --> 27:25.600
All I know is this chick rode
out of nowhere like Zorro

27:25.770 --> 27:28.011
- on a horse and took Lori.
- You let her?

27:28.189 --> 27:29.725
Climb down out of
my ass, old man.

27:29.899 --> 27:32.481
Rick sent her.
She knew Lori's name and Carl's.

27:32.652 --> 27:34.813
I heard screams.
Was that you?

27:34.987 --> 27:36.568
She got attacked
by a walker.

27:36.739 --> 27:39.822
- It was a close call.
- Andrea, are you all right?

27:46.666 --> 27:49.157
( door slams)

28:15.444 --> 28:18.481
Rick:
This place is beautiful.

28:18.656 --> 28:22.444
Been in my family
160 years.

28:22.618 --> 28:24.483
I can't believe
how serene it is.

28:24.662 --> 28:27.278
How untouched.
You're lucky.

28:27.456 --> 28:30.198
We weren't
completely unscathed.

28:30.376 --> 28:33.960
We lost friends, neighbors.

28:34.130 --> 28:37.964
The epidemic
took my wife,

28:38.134 --> 28:39.840
my stepson.

28:40.011 --> 28:41.592
I'm sorry.

28:41.762 --> 28:43.138
My daughters
were spared.

28:43.306 --> 28:45.672
I'm grateful
to God for that.

28:48.019 --> 28:49.850
These people here,

28:50.021 --> 28:52.228
all we've got left
is each other.

28:52.398 --> 28:55.561
Just hoping we can
ride it out in peace

28:55.735 --> 28:57.691
till there's a cure.

28:59.071 --> 29:01.687
We were at the CDC.

29:01.866 --> 29:04.858
It's gone now.

29:05.036 --> 29:06.822
There is no cure.

29:06.996 --> 29:10.033
I don't believe it.

29:10.207 --> 29:13.745
When AIDS came along,
everyone panicked.

29:13.920 --> 29:16.662
One boy in town
came down with it

29:16.839 --> 29:19.797
and some parents pulled
their children from school

29:19.967 --> 29:21.582
so they didn't have
to sit in the same room.

29:21.761 --> 29:21.965
This is a whole
other thing.

29:21.969 --> 29:23.800
This is a whole
other thing.

29:23.971 --> 29:25.882
That's what
we always say--

29:26.057 --> 29:28.173
- "This one's different."
- Well, this one is.

29:29.518 --> 29:32.385
Mankind's been fighting
plagues from the start.

29:32.563 --> 29:35.350
We get our behinds
kicked for a while

29:35.524 --> 29:37.776
then we bounce back.

29:37.944 --> 29:40.560
It's nature
correcting herself,

29:40.738 --> 29:43.571
restoring some balance.

29:45.117 --> 29:47.403
| wish I could
believe that.

29:50.957 --> 29:53.164
( hoofbeats galloping )

30:19.026 --> 30:21.688
( silent )

30:31.330 --> 30:33.286
I'm sorry.

30:48.681 --> 30:50.717
My boy.

30:51.976 --> 30:55.309
My baby boy.
Baby boy.

30:55.479 --> 30:58.266
It's okay.

30:58.441 --> 31:01.649
Mama's here.
Mama's here.

31:01.819 --> 31:04.686
You're gonna be okay.

31:04.864 --> 31:06.820
You're gonna
be okay.

31:06.991 --> 31:09.403
We're gonna
make you okay.

31:40.149 --> 31:42.606
Slow. Slow.

31:43.861 --> 31:45.943
- How many transfusions?
- Two.

31:46.113 --> 31:48.695
Only two.

31:48.866 --> 31:52.358
He wanted to do the same for you
when you were in the hospital.

31:52.536 --> 31:54.197
I had to talk him
out of it.

32:09.720 --> 32:11.676
Thank you.

32:18.479 --> 32:21.516
Okay, so I understand,

32:21.690 --> 32:24.557
when Shane gets back
with this other man--

32:24.735 --> 32:27.067
- Otis.
- Otis.

32:27.238 --> 32:29.229
The idiot
who shot my son.

32:29.406 --> 32:32.022
Ma'am, it was an accident.

32:32.201 --> 32:33.407
I'll take that under
advisement later.

32:33.577 --> 32:35.283
For now he's the idiot
who shot our son.

32:35.454 --> 32:38.070
Lori, they're doing everything
they can to make it right.

32:38.249 --> 32:41.161
Okay, as soon as they get back
you can perform this surgery?

32:41.335 --> 32:43.826
l'll certainly
do my best.

32:44.004 --> 32:46.256
Okay. You've done this
procedure before?

32:46.423 --> 32:48.459
Well, yes, in a sense.

32:48.634 --> 32:51.171
In a sense?

32:51.345 --> 32:53.927
Honey, we don't have the luxury
of shopping for a surgeon.

32:54.098 --> 32:57.807
No, I understand that.
But I mean you're a doctor, right?

32:57.977 --> 33:00.639
Yes, ma'am.
Of course.

33:00.813 --> 33:03.850
- A vet.
- A veteran? A combat medic?

33:04.024 --> 33:06.686
A veterinarian.

33:16.162 --> 33:20.622
And you've done this surgery
before on what?

33:20.791 --> 33:23.123
Cows? Pigs?

33:23.294 --> 33:25.626
|-- l have--
I have to sit.

33:32.803 --> 33:34.839
Completely in over
your head, aren't you?

33:35.014 --> 33:38.802
Ma'am, aren't we all?

33:46.483 --> 33:48.769
Shh, shh.

33:57.828 --> 34:00.410
Okay, let's take a look.

34:02.625 --> 34:05.958
(moaning, snarling)

34:10.966 --> 34:15.335
You see that big mobile medical
trailer across the way?

34:19.350 --> 34:21.011
That's where
we got to get to?

34:21.185 --> 34:23.517
- Yeah.
- ( sighs)

34:26.190 --> 34:29.102
I won't do it.
We can't just leave.

34:29.276 --> 34:33.235
Carol, the group is split.
We're scattered and weak.

34:33.405 --> 34:36.192
What if she comes back
and we're not here?

34:36.367 --> 34:38.232
It could happen.

34:38.410 --> 34:40.366
If Sophia found her way
back and we were gone,

34:40.537 --> 34:41.947
that would be awful.

34:42.122 --> 34:43.953
Okay.

34:44.124 --> 34:46.376
We got to plan for this.

34:46.543 --> 34:48.875
I say tomorrow morning
is soon enough to pull up stakes.

34:49.046 --> 34:51.628
Give us a chance
to rig a big sign,

34:51.799 --> 34:53.881
leave her some supplies.

34:54.051 --> 34:55.916
l'll hold here tonight,
stay with the RV.

34:56.095 --> 34:58.131
If the RV is staying,
lam too.

34:58.305 --> 35:00.967
Thank you.
Thank you both.

35:03.978 --> 35:06.390
I'm in.

35:06.563 --> 35:08.224
Well, if you're all
staying then I'm--

35:08.399 --> 35:09.730
Not you, Glenn.
You're going.

35:09.900 --> 35:11.561
Take Carol's Cherokee.

35:11.735 --> 35:14.226
Me?
Why is it always me?

35:14.405 --> 35:17.067
You have to find this farm,
reconnect with our people

35:17.241 --> 35:18.947
and see what's going on.
But most important,

35:19.118 --> 35:22.406
you have to get T-Dog there.
This is not an option.

35:22.579 --> 35:24.956
That cut has gone
from bad to worse.

35:25.124 --> 35:27.456
He has a very serious
blood infection.

35:27.626 --> 35:31.084
Get him to that farm.
See if they have any antibiotics.

35:31.255 --> 35:34.463
Because if not,
T-Dog will die, no joke.

35:42.474 --> 35:44.760
Keep your oily rags off
my brother's motorcycle.

35:44.935 --> 35:46.721
Why'd you wait till now
to say anything?

35:46.895 --> 35:48.431
Got my brother's stash.

35:49.940 --> 35:53.148
Crystal, X.
Don't need that.

35:53.319 --> 35:54.934
Got some kick ass
painkillers.

35:57.823 --> 35:59.484
Oxycycline.

35:59.658 --> 36:02.616
Not the generic stuff neither.
lt's first class.

36:02.786 --> 36:05.448
Merle got the clap
on occasion.

36:11.795 --> 36:15.458
(soft hissing, whining)

36:32.149 --> 36:34.140
( handle squeaks,
clicks softly )

36:34.318 --> 36:36.730
( soft gasp )

36:38.280 --> 36:40.646
(faint squeaking )

36:48.832 --> 36:51.164
(trunk squeaks)

37:04.973 --> 37:07.510
( chuckles )

37:16.568 --> 37:19.685
(moaning)

37:20.864 --> 37:23.651
( snarls )

37:28.705 --> 37:31.082
(snarling )

38:03.157 --> 38:05.398
(air hissing)

38:10.914 --> 38:13.576
Pressure's dropping again.

38:13.750 --> 38:15.286
We can't wait much longer.

38:15.461 --> 38:17.247
Take some more.
Whatever he needs.

38:17.421 --> 38:19.457
- Then I'm gonna go.
- Go? Go where?

38:19.631 --> 38:21.542
He said five miles.
They should be long back by now.

38:21.717 --> 38:23.332
- Something's gone wrong.
- Are you insane?

38:23.510 --> 38:25.466
- You're not going after them.
- Rick, listen to your wife.

38:25.637 --> 38:26.968
If they got into trouble--

38:27.139 --> 38:29.801
You're in no condition
to do anything about it.

38:29.975 --> 38:32.762
You've given too much blood.
You're barely on your feet.

38:32.936 --> 38:34.801
You wouldn't make it
across the yard.

38:34.980 --> 38:37.016
If something happened,
I have to go.

38:37.191 --> 38:38.806
No, your place is here.

38:38.984 --> 38:41.066
lf Shane said he'll be
back, he'll be back.

38:41.236 --> 38:42.942
- He's like you that way.
- l can'tjust sit here.

38:43.113 --> 38:44.899
That's exactly what you do!

38:45.073 --> 38:46.779
If you need
to pray or cry

38:46.950 --> 38:48.781
or tell God he's cruel,
you go right ahead,

38:48.952 --> 38:50.533
but you're not leaving, Rick.

38:50.704 --> 38:53.116
Carl needs you-- here.

38:53.290 --> 38:56.748
( softly )
And I can't do this by myself.

38:57.753 --> 38:59.835
Not this one.

39:00.005 --> 39:01.620
I can't.

39:03.133 --> 39:04.748
I can't.

39:09.097 --> 39:10.473
Is this it?

39:10.641 --> 39:12.973
Otis:
Yeah, three. Three.

39:13.143 --> 39:15.259
( clangs )

39:39.336 --> 39:41.827
Oh, here.

39:42.005 --> 39:44.838
Endotracheal intubator, baby,

39:45.008 --> 39:47.124
for my new respirator.

39:47.302 --> 39:50.089
Attaboy.
Come on.

40:05.362 --> 40:07.102
(moaning)

40:07.281 --> 40:09.488
- Come on.
- Damn it.

40:13.704 --> 40:15.535
Come on!
Stay with me!

40:16.540 --> 40:18.531
(snarling )

40:21.378 --> 40:23.835
(grunting)

40:30.095 --> 40:33.053
- ( growling )
- No-- no, no, no, no!

40:39.771 --> 40:41.307
Come on.

40:41.481 --> 40:43.472
No, no, no, no!
Come on. Come on.

40:43.650 --> 40:45.311
ln here.

40:45.485 --> 40:48.147
Damn.

40:48.322 --> 40:50.654
Okay, okay.
Stay back! Stay back!

40:56.455 --> 40:58.912
(walkers growling )

41:02.919 --> 41:05.171
( rattling )

41:13.180 --> 41:15.922
(growling, moaning)

41:25.692 --> 41:27.728
Damn it.

41:29.821 --> 41:32.107
(growling, moaning)

41:35.452 --> 41:37.613
( rattling )

41:44.836 --> 41:46.827
(theme music playing )
