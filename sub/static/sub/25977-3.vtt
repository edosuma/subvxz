00:38.330 --> 00:40.750
There are no statements as yet
from the Police

00:40.791 --> 00:43.169
about this latest
terrorist attack.

00:43.210 --> 00:45.004
It's unclear who was
responsible...

02:08.671 --> 02:11.131
May God forgive you.

02:56.093 --> 02:59.305
Now the head.

03:21.744 --> 03:24.079
Grandpa's in charge...

03:24.121 --> 03:25.122
...okay?

06:42.277 --> 06:43.278
More or less.

07:09.179 --> 07:11.473
Wait for me, I'll be right back.

07:16.186 --> 07:18.522
I was worried.
What took you so long?

07:18.564 --> 07:21.692
I wish you gave me more time.

07:21.733 --> 07:24.111
Here are the passports.

07:30.868 --> 07:32.578
I don't know how to thank you.

07:32.619 --> 07:33.579
You're very welcome.

07:33.620 --> 07:35.414
How much did it cost?

07:35.455 --> 07:37.249
I didn't do it for the money.

07:37.291 --> 07:39.459
I did it for you
and the children.

07:41.587 --> 07:44.506
Uncle Fathi.

07:44.548 --> 07:47.676
I will never forget this.

07:55.809 --> 07:57.352
Hanin?

07:57.394 --> 07:59.771
Take care of yourself.

08:04.943 --> 08:06.528
Let's go, sweethearts.

09:06.672 --> 09:07.756
Who is he?

09:07.798 --> 09:09.675
How should I know?

09:09.716 --> 09:11.134
He's in your house.

09:18.976 --> 09:20.143
Papa!

09:20.185 --> 09:22.479
It's okay!

09:23.689 --> 09:24.898
Calm down.

09:24.940 --> 09:27.567
Go play outside. Now.

09:35.867 --> 09:37.744
You're lucky, you know.

09:40.414 --> 09:42.958
The bullet missed your pancreas
by only a few centimeters.

09:48.380 --> 09:50.132
Take this. Put it on.

10:00.392 --> 10:01.476
Easy...

10:08.942 --> 10:11.945
I thought I'd never
see you again.

10:11.987 --> 10:18.243
I assume you had good reason to
come here instead of a hospital?

10:25.083 --> 10:27.711
Where is Dalia?

10:29.421 --> 10:32.382
She died of cancer.
Three years ago.

10:40.182 --> 10:42.267
I see you're still drawing.

10:45.937 --> 10:48.899
I want to show you something.

11:07.376 --> 11:09.461
You kept them?

11:12.089 --> 11:14.508
Do you remember
when you were a boy

11:14.549 --> 11:16.927
you'd beg me to take you
to the MusÃ©e d'Orsay

11:16.968 --> 11:19.137
to see the Van Goghs?

11:37.531 --> 11:39.991
Did you ever see them?
The Van Goghs?

15:33.308 --> 15:36.603
Captain, the police and SWAT
are 10 minutes out. Over.

21:50.643 --> 21:51.853
Go get the Sheikh.

21:51.894 --> 21:53.021
What is it?

21:53.062 --> 21:54.313
Just go.

22:01.612 --> 22:03.781
-What's going on?
-Look.

22:07.368 --> 22:09.328
Ask him where he is.

26:05.398 --> 26:08.234
Can I help you, brother?

26:09.443 --> 26:12.446
Have you seen this man?

26:20.496 --> 26:21.956
Thank you.

26:42.685 --> 26:45.896
Excuse me, please. Come here.

26:51.610 --> 26:52.611
Do you know him?

26:58.868 --> 27:00.453
It's okay, son.

27:00.494 --> 27:03.456
You're not in trouble.

27:03.497 --> 27:09.795
It's important
you tell me the truth.

27:13.799 --> 27:16.385
Do you know this man?

27:37.531 --> 27:39.075
-You know what?
-You're gonna buy it?

27:39.116 --> 27:40.785
Yes, how much?

27:40.826 --> 27:42.745
-140.
-140?

27:42.787 --> 27:44.497
Who will give me back my money?

27:44.538 --> 27:46.415
Now steal from the bank,
and give it to me.

27:48.793 --> 27:50.461
My love.

27:50.503 --> 27:52.421
My love?

27:52.463 --> 27:54.298
Join us.

27:54.340 --> 27:56.759
I can't. I have to start dinner.

27:56.801 --> 27:58.302
For me, Mama, come.

28:01.514 --> 28:05.851
When was the last time we all
sat together as a family?

28:08.062 --> 28:09.647
Look.

28:11.399 --> 28:13.901
I saved you the shoe.

28:16.278 --> 28:18.447
Fine, but I have
to make dinner after.

28:22.368 --> 28:24.203
One, two, three, four, five.

28:24.245 --> 28:26.539
A railroad!
Are you going to buy it, Mom?

28:26.580 --> 28:27.581
No, Mama.

28:30.668 --> 28:31.919
Sure, why not?

28:35.631 --> 28:36.590
How much?

28:36.632 --> 28:38.008
200 dollars.

28:41.720 --> 28:48.144
Did I ever tell you
how I proposed to your mother?

28:48.185 --> 28:50.354
You don't have to, dear.

28:50.396 --> 28:52.481
Why not?

28:52.523 --> 28:54.150
Tell us, Papa!

28:55.693 --> 28:58.237
She wasn't much older
than you are now, Sara.

28:58.279 --> 29:00.990
How old were you, dear?

29:01.031 --> 29:03.659
Sixteen.

29:03.701 --> 29:04.702
Seriously?

29:04.743 --> 29:06.954
Sixteen!

29:10.374 --> 29:14.086
I was coming home from the war
in Ramadi, Iraq...

29:14.128 --> 29:16.881
fighting against the invaders.

29:18.048 --> 29:20.092
Suddenly...

29:20.134 --> 29:23.179
my car broke down
in the middle of the desert.

29:23.220 --> 29:25.306
After a few hours,

29:25.347 --> 29:28.058
a man came along in his truck.

29:28.100 --> 29:30.895
and stopped and picked me up.

29:30.936 --> 29:33.939
We drove to his house nearby...

29:33.981 --> 29:36.817
and he invited me in for dinner.

29:37.735 --> 29:41.697
I sat down at the table,

29:41.739 --> 29:44.366
looked up, and saw

29:44.408 --> 29:47.411
this beautiful girl
coming with a pot of soup.

29:47.453 --> 29:50.164
Oh my God, how beautiful!

29:50.206 --> 29:53.250
Your mother, not the soup!

29:58.547 --> 30:02.218
Her father didn't work
or have money.

30:02.259 --> 30:05.346
He did have a beautiful
daughter...

30:09.141 --> 30:11.268
He offered her to me.

30:11.310 --> 30:13.979
For the night.

30:20.110 --> 30:23.739
I looked at your mother...

30:23.781 --> 30:26.700
and I felt as if the hand of God

30:26.742 --> 30:29.620
brought me to this place
for a reason.

30:29.662 --> 30:34.416
So I told her father
I didn't want her in that way.

30:34.458 --> 30:38.546
I wanted to marry her. Properly.

30:41.340 --> 30:44.301
The next day...

30:44.343 --> 30:46.887
I took her away
from that village

30:46.929 --> 30:48.681
and married her.

30:50.558 --> 30:53.185
And now?

30:53.227 --> 30:55.479
We have no secrets
from each other.

31:07.241 --> 31:10.244
We're not going to hide things
from each other.

31:18.168 --> 31:19.878
Isn't that right, my love?

31:57.207 --> 31:59.460
When he showed up, bleeding,

31:59.501 --> 32:01.337
I hadn't seen him in years.

32:01.378 --> 32:03.505
What should I have done?

32:03.547 --> 32:04.798
Let him die at my door?

32:04.840 --> 32:06.884
We know you helped him!

32:06.925 --> 32:08.177
I'm a doctor.

32:08.218 --> 32:10.512
At least I was, in Lebanon.

32:35.621 --> 32:37.831
I don't want to play that game.
It's stupid!

32:37.873 --> 32:39.083
Quiet! Both of you!

33:41.562 --> 33:43.731
Sara, wake up, baby!

33:44.857 --> 33:46.358
Get up and get changed.

33:46.400 --> 33:49.027
Wake up your sister, and get
three days' change of clothes.

33:51.029 --> 33:53.907
Mama, what's going on?

33:53.949 --> 33:56.994
We're taking a trip, my love.
We have to leave right now.

33:57.035 --> 33:58.287
Where's Dad?

33:58.328 --> 34:00.122
Your Dad's not coming.

34:00.164 --> 34:01.749
-Let's get you dressed--
-No.

34:02.750 --> 34:04.501
Listen to me!

34:04.543 --> 34:06.211
Mama, I'm not going anywhere
if Dad's not--

34:06.253 --> 34:07.254
Get dressed right now!

34:07.296 --> 34:09.339
You can't make me!

34:09.381 --> 34:10.841
Samir, come back! Samir!

34:13.719 --> 34:16.555
Go get your things.

34:16.597 --> 34:18.640
Don't worry, I'll come back.

34:18.682 --> 34:21.560
But right now
we have to move quickly.

34:21.602 --> 34:23.979
Your Dad loves Samir so much.

34:24.021 --> 34:26.940
He'll be safe here. Let's go.

34:29.777 --> 34:31.779
Papa!

34:34.281 --> 34:36.283
Papa!

34:47.586 --> 34:49.505
Someone left us a car?

34:49.546 --> 34:51.381
We are strong,

34:51.423 --> 34:54.968
but it is not our weapons
that make us strong.

34:55.010 --> 34:57.304
It is our faith.

35:03.894 --> 35:06.063
You know how to drive?

35:07.564 --> 35:09.024
Uncle Fathi taught me.

35:12.986 --> 35:14.863
Excuse me, brothers.

35:14.905 --> 35:15.864
Fathi...

35:15.906 --> 35:17.950
Yes, my Sheikh.

35:26.208 --> 35:28.460
How could this happen
without you knowing?

35:28.502 --> 35:30.587
-Trust me, I don't know--
-I did trust you!

35:30.629 --> 35:32.130
With my family.

35:32.172 --> 35:36.510
You find them
and bring them back.

35:36.552 --> 35:38.512
-Yes, my Sheikh.
-Now go.

35:38.554 --> 35:40.222
-Yazid!
-Yes, my Sheikh.

35:40.264 --> 35:41.890
Go with him.

35:41.932 --> 35:44.560
-But--
-No "buts!" Bring them home!

35:44.601 --> 35:46.728
Yes, my Sheikh.

35:58.782 --> 36:00.492
We know he was using the game

36:00.534 --> 36:02.327
to communicate with his cell.

36:02.369 --> 36:05.122
We know they told him to go

36:05.163 --> 36:06.915
-to go to a rendezvous point--
-I told you already...

36:06.957 --> 36:09.334
I don't know where Ali went.

36:09.376 --> 36:11.253
But you helped him!

36:11.295 --> 36:17.134
Those two kids in the other room
need their father.

36:17.175 --> 36:20.929
If you keep protecting Ali,
I'll have to arrest you.

36:23.432 --> 36:27.644
He said he just needed a car.

36:29.187 --> 36:32.774
So I gave him mine.

36:46.163 --> 36:47.122
Okay, Mama...

36:47.164 --> 36:49.124
now what?

36:49.166 --> 36:50.417
It's okay, darling.

36:52.252 --> 36:53.337
There's a town just up ahead.

36:54.463 --> 36:56.840
We'll walk.

36:56.882 --> 36:59.176
We have no water, no food.

36:59.217 --> 37:00.719
Dad's gonna send someone--

37:00.761 --> 37:02.930
Enough, Sara.
I don't wanna hear it!

37:07.059 --> 37:08.393
It's okay, darling.

37:08.435 --> 37:09.937
Don't be scared.

37:12.189 --> 37:15.943
God will protect us.

37:19.154 --> 37:21.907
God will protect us.

37:25.410 --> 37:27.704
Grab your stuff.

37:30.207 --> 37:31.416
Let's go, follow us!

39:48.220 --> 39:50.722
Sara.

39:50.764 --> 39:53.225
Go get some food
for you and your sister.

39:53.266 --> 39:54.518
Go on.

39:54.559 --> 39:56.353
Meet me at the taxis.

41:18.226 --> 41:20.020
Hello, sir.

41:20.061 --> 41:21.646
How much to get to the border?

41:21.688 --> 41:24.107
Three of those.

42:04.064 --> 42:05.482
Let's go.

42:05.523 --> 42:06.942
But we didn't get our food!

42:31.758 --> 42:32.801
We don't go there.

42:32.842 --> 42:34.219
Our lives are in danger.

42:34.261 --> 42:35.553
I have to get to the border!

42:35.595 --> 42:37.055
I beg you.

42:37.097 --> 42:38.598
No, I can't.

42:38.640 --> 42:40.183
I have to get to the border...

42:40.225 --> 42:41.601
Yazid and Fathi are here.

42:49.150 --> 42:50.235
Let's go!

42:50.277 --> 42:52.153
Come on, let's go!

43:49.210 --> 43:51.004
Leave them alone!

43:52.505 --> 43:54.549
Come here, don't be afraid.

43:54.591 --> 43:55.842
Go, run!

44:19.282 --> 44:20.909
Tie her up!

44:20.950 --> 44:21.910
Take it easy!

44:21.951 --> 44:23.328
Sara!

44:23.370 --> 44:24.746
Hanin, calm down!

44:28.333 --> 44:29.626
Mama!

44:29.667 --> 44:31.461
Calm down. Easy, easy.

44:34.172 --> 44:35.799
Don't move!

44:37.425 --> 44:40.637
Did you forget? We're family...

44:40.678 --> 44:43.390
You know what
they'll do to me...

44:45.392 --> 44:47.394
I know. Give me time.

44:47.435 --> 44:49.479
I have to figure out
how to get rid of this dog.

44:52.357 --> 44:53.608
Kill him.

44:53.650 --> 44:57.237
And tell my husband
that I did it.

45:06.079 --> 45:08.123
You were saying?

45:46.744 --> 45:49.289
Help me, help me!

45:51.624 --> 45:53.001
Someone help!

46:02.469 --> 46:04.471
Someone help me!

48:11.139 --> 48:12.181
See?

48:12.223 --> 48:14.434
I told you...

48:14.475 --> 48:17.478
God would protect us.
