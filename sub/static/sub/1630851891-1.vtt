00:23.040 --> 00:25.640
<i>For a long time,
I couldn't get the scene out of my head.</i>

00:25.720 --> 00:26.920
<i>The scenes of the victims…</i>

00:28.920 --> 00:32.920
<i>dismembered, how they would have suffered.</i>

00:35.000 --> 00:37.479
<i>It was incredibly difficult.
It's still difficult.</i>

00:43.640 --> 00:47.480
<i>This was the first serial killer
I personally interviewed.</i>

00:47.560 --> 00:49.280
<i>I was very motivated.</i>

00:51.160 --> 00:54.400
<i>He took pride in feeling</i>

00:54.480 --> 00:58.600
<i>that he was in control of the profiler.</i>

01:00.760 --> 01:03.720
So, it was like psychological warfare.

01:03.800 --> 01:05.240
Yes, you could say that.

01:19.440 --> 01:21.000
<i>As soon as I met him,</i>

01:21.080 --> 01:27.440
<i>it was obvious that he was proud
of how he was talked about by the press.</i>

01:27.520 --> 01:33.880
<i>I could tell from his facial expressions
and his tone of voice.</i>

01:35.960 --> 01:41.880
<i>I asked him why he marked the site
where the victims were buried,</i>

01:42.920 --> 01:46.920
<i>and he said it was because he
didn't want to dig the same place twice…</i>

01:49.200 --> 01:51.120
<i>as he had to continuously bury
his future victims.</i>

01:51.200 --> 01:53.480
<i>He put markers
that only he'd be able to recognize.</i>

01:54.440 --> 01:58.360
<i>I've never again heard
such cruel words in my life.</i>

01:59.760 --> 02:01.840
<i>What I realized then was</i>

02:03.320 --> 02:05.600
<i>that to understand criminals,</i>

02:05.680 --> 02:08.600
<i>one has to take a walk inside their minds.</i>

02:10.240 --> 02:13.360
<i>The experience was so devastating</i>

02:13.440 --> 02:16.720
<i>that I believed I would never be
the same person again.</i>

02:22.600 --> 02:23.440
A MAN OF RELIGION

02:23.520 --> 02:26.280
<i>I was once a deeply religious man.</i>

02:28.120 --> 02:31.240
<i>I have no idea how I came to walk…</i>

02:33.240 --> 02:34.240
<i>such a devious path.</i>

02:36.600 --> 02:40.760
<i>The body of a Hwanghak-dong vendor
was found burnt in his van…</i>

02:40.840 --> 02:41.720
<i>His body was burnt.</i>

02:41.800 --> 02:45.400
<i>His entire body was burnt to a crisp.
That's how he died.</i>

02:45.480 --> 02:49.440
I was extremely upset by that
among many other things.

02:49.520 --> 02:51.160
The police suspected his brothers.

02:51.240 --> 02:55.280
It might sound out of place
for me to say this,

02:55.360 --> 02:59.240
but the level of police in this country
was that bad.

02:59.320 --> 03:02.200
This was the case
that motivated the police to do better.

03:02.280 --> 03:04.640
The police didn’t know
the victim’s identity

03:04.720 --> 03:05.840
as everything was burned.

03:05.920 --> 03:07.920
There was nothing
that could be identified.

03:08.640 --> 03:10.960
They wanted to find the fingerprints,
but they couldn't

03:11.040 --> 03:12.400
because everything was burned.

03:12.480 --> 03:14.960
<i>I held onto the wrist and prayed.</i>

03:15.040 --> 03:16.120
<i>"Please help me.</i>

03:16.880 --> 03:18.360
<i>Please wait a little longer.</i>

03:20.120 --> 03:21.520
<i>We'll catch him soon."</i>

03:21.600 --> 03:23.760
Even now, it breaks my heart
just thinking about it.

03:28.520 --> 03:31.400
<i>From the time I turned 30,</i>

03:31.480 --> 03:34.160
<i>all I had left in me was hatred and anger.</i>

03:35.440 --> 03:37.960
<i>Numerous cases have remained unsolved,</i>

03:38.040 --> 03:40.400
<i>causing the public to grow
even more anxious.</i>

03:40.960 --> 03:45.880
It's now a battle of wits between
the forensics team and the criminals.

03:46.520 --> 03:50.440
These cases had the entire nation
in an uproar.

03:51.000 --> 03:54.880
All the cases I'm telling you about,

03:55.400 --> 03:58.520
I still see them in a panoramic view
before my eyes.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.360
<i>I believe that I may have</i>

04:03.440 --> 04:05.880
<i>a few drops of crazy blood
flowing through my body.</i>

04:23.000 --> 04:27.320
<i>Let me tell you
about the series of murders</i>

04:27.400 --> 04:29.920
<i>that targeted wealthy individuals
in Seoul.</i>

04:31.440 --> 04:34.600
<i>My daily routine</i>

04:34.680 --> 04:38.080
<i>consists of meeting with
and interviewing criminals</i>

04:38.160 --> 04:40.800
<i>who are in prison or in holding cells.</i>

04:42.000 --> 04:45.160
<i>I'd produce analytical reports</i>

04:45.240 --> 04:47.360
<i>based on the interviews I had conducted.</i>

04:48.440 --> 04:50.840
<i>When the first case occurred,</i>

04:51.800 --> 04:54.880
<i>that's what I was doing in my office.</i>

04:54.960 --> 04:57.680
<i>I stopped what I was doing</i>

04:59.160 --> 05:02.720
<i>and headed out to the crime scene
when the dispatch call came in.</i>

05:02.800 --> 05:07.480
<i>I didn't think that day
would be any special</i>

05:08.040 --> 05:11.080
<i>since there are a lot of murders in Seoul.</i>

05:12.440 --> 05:15.040
OCTOBER 9, 2003

05:19.280 --> 05:21.680
KCSI

05:29.280 --> 05:30.840
<i>We received a dispatch request.</i>

05:31.880 --> 05:34.920
"There has been a murder.
We need you on the site."

05:35.000 --> 05:38.720
We hurried to the scene
when the call came in.

05:38.800 --> 05:40.840
Before me,

05:41.520 --> 05:44.120
all of the CSI staff on-site were men.

05:44.200 --> 05:48.280
At that time, I was the first woman
to be dispatched to the scene.

05:51.080 --> 05:53.280
I got a call that there had been a murder.

05:54.240 --> 05:58.200
I usually tend to stay
within our area of jurisdiction.

05:58.920 --> 06:03.720
At the time, it was
one of the wealthiest areas in Korea.

06:05.920 --> 06:11.120
GUGI-DONG

06:11.880 --> 06:15.160
The victim’s husband reported the crime
after he returned home from work,

06:15.240 --> 06:17.160
so the body was found in the evening.

06:22.880 --> 06:24.600
DO NOT CROSS
UNDER INVESTIGATION

06:25.520 --> 06:28.840
I went to all the murders
that took place in Seoul.

06:28.920 --> 06:32.320
There was a certain feeling

06:32.400 --> 06:34.200
that I got from that particular scene.

06:36.200 --> 06:37.680
An ominous air or sorts…

06:39.000 --> 06:40.280
It was spine-chilling.

06:41.680 --> 06:43.040
That's how it made me feel.

06:44.680 --> 06:47.840
I still can't forget that feeling
even to this day.

06:48.800 --> 06:50.640
It wasn't just me.

06:51.200 --> 06:55.560
The senior investigators
who were at the scene felt it, too.

06:57.400 --> 06:59.640
<i>You'd know if you were there,</i>

06:59.720 --> 07:03.280
but the atmosphere there
was difficult to describe in words.

07:05.240 --> 07:09.840
<i>When you first enter,
you see the entrance of the bathroom.</i>

07:10.960 --> 07:13.680
<i>That's where the grandmother
was lying on the floor.</i>

07:15.160 --> 07:17.560
<i>As you went in further,
there was a kitchen,</i>

07:18.480 --> 07:20.760
<i>and there was an aquarium
in front of the kitchen.</i>

07:23.760 --> 07:27.000
<i>And further inside,
the daughter-in-law lay collapsed</i>

07:28.240 --> 07:31.200
<i>on the floor in front of the kitchen sink.</i>

07:32.160 --> 07:35.920
Her skull was dented so badly

07:36.000 --> 07:39.240
<i>that I couldn't tell
what the assailant had used to do this.</i>

07:41.440 --> 07:44.520
<i>We had to go up to the second floor,
but we were overcome with fear…</i>

07:45.720 --> 07:48.640
<i>when we saw the entire flight of stairs
covered in blood.</i>

07:50.720 --> 07:54.640
<i>We even thought that the assailant
might still be hiding upstairs.</i>

07:54.720 --> 07:57.640
It made us feel as if the assailant

07:57.720 --> 08:00.160
was hiding upstairs
with his weapon in hand.

08:00.240 --> 08:03.760
It struck me with fear
and sent a chill down my spine.

08:05.880 --> 08:08.000
<i>As we went up the stairs
and around the corner,</i>

08:08.080 --> 08:11.600
<i>we found the body of the son who seemed
to have been attacked on his way down.</i>

08:13.560 --> 08:17.880
His head was struck so many times
that his brain was scattered everywhere.

08:19.200 --> 08:24.160
His head had burst and his brain
was scattered all over the place.

08:24.240 --> 08:28.600
It was extremely gruesome.

08:31.280 --> 08:34.080
<i>When we go to the crime site,
we would place blocks to step on</i>

08:34.160 --> 08:36.800
<i>and approach the main areas</i>

08:36.880 --> 08:38.520
<i>so as not to contaminate the scene.</i>

08:39.760 --> 08:44.080
<i>But there was so much blood</i>

08:44.159 --> 08:46.640
<i>that we couldn't find the room
to place the blocks.</i>

08:50.440 --> 08:52.800
<i>Since the assailant's feet
had to touch the ground</i>

08:52.880 --> 08:55.000
<i>in order for him to get around,</i>

08:55.080 --> 08:58.720
<i>there was bound to be evidence
no matter how hard he'd try to remove it.</i>

09:01.960 --> 09:03.440
<i>We ended up</i>

09:04.360 --> 09:07.280
<i>collecting two very faint footprints.</i>

09:07.800 --> 09:11.720
First, we checked to see if it was from
the shoes worn by a family member.

09:11.800 --> 09:14.000
If not, it would belong to the assailant.

09:14.520 --> 09:18.200
<i>We weren't able to identify the assailant,
but it would help in the investigation.</i>

09:22.680 --> 09:24.080
<i>What didn't make sense was</i>

09:24.160 --> 09:27.600
<i>that there were no signs
of the victims fighting back.</i>

09:27.680 --> 09:29.520
<i>It seemed very one-sided.</i>

09:30.080 --> 09:32.200
So I wondered

09:32.280 --> 09:37.800
how such a thing could have happened
in broad daylight.

09:38.360 --> 09:40.480
Naturally, we had no choice

09:40.560 --> 09:43.280
but to investigate the husband
and the people around him.

09:45.320 --> 09:49.520
<i>Ko Jung-won
was a relatively successful businessman.</i>

09:53.120 --> 09:59.240
Mr. Ko Jung-won and I developed
a special relationship.

09:59.720 --> 10:05.160
I have known him for more than 10 years.
It's almost been 14 years.

10:05.640 --> 10:09.680
And at first,
we met as a documentary director

10:10.160 --> 10:12.280
and as the main character.

10:13.120 --> 10:19.240
But later, I became his godson.

10:19.320 --> 10:25.560
As a journalist, I have the responsibility
to leave a record of the people I film.

10:26.040 --> 10:30.280
He is very hardworking and humble.

10:30.360 --> 10:32.320
He knows how to be considerate to others.

10:32.920 --> 10:34.680
He is a very gentle person.

10:34.760 --> 10:37.600
That's why it came as such a shock
to many people who knew him.

10:38.400 --> 10:43.760
<i>He suddenly lost his mother, wife,
and son.</i>

10:44.640 --> 10:48.960
But in the case of such a cruel murder,

10:49.040 --> 10:51.840
who would the police suspect first?

10:53.600 --> 10:57.760
Mr. Koh, who was a husband,
a father and a son,

10:57.840 --> 10:59.720
was the first to be suspected.

10:59.800 --> 11:02.560
Not everyone believed
that he was innocent,

11:02.640 --> 11:03.840
especially the police.

11:05.840 --> 11:12.840
<i>We investigated everyone
who had anything to do with him.</i>

11:13.560 --> 11:16.160
What Ko Jung-won did that day,

11:16.680 --> 11:21.480
and whether anyone held
any resentment toward him?

11:21.560 --> 11:24.400
Or if he had any extra-marital relations,

11:24.480 --> 11:28.120
or what other problems he may have faced
leading to his bankruptcy.

11:30.120 --> 11:36.480
<i>He kept asking us, "Why are you
doing this to me when my family is dead?"</i>

11:38.240 --> 11:43.480
But it was all a part
of the investigation process.

11:45.720 --> 11:50.920
He said he was sorry
to his wife, mother, and son.

11:51.640 --> 11:54.120
He was sorry
that he couldn't protect them.

11:56.760 --> 11:59.240
He said that repeatedly as he cried.

11:59.720 --> 12:03.240
So he kept asking the fish
these questions as if he had gone mad.

12:03.320 --> 12:04.840
<i>"Didn't you see who it was?</i>

12:04.920 --> 12:07.680
<i>Who was it? Why did they do it?</i>

12:07.760 --> 12:09.120
<i>How did they die?"</i>

12:11.080 --> 12:12.280
And…

12:14.880 --> 12:17.000
that was very heart-wrenching
for me to hear.

12:19.440 --> 12:24.480
<i>He was deeply grieving
the loss of his family,</i>

12:24.560 --> 12:27.120
<i>so it was difficult for us
to identify him as the killer.</i>

12:28.240 --> 12:33.800
We didn't find anyone
who held a particular grudge against him.

12:33.880 --> 12:37.040
<i>He wasn't the type of person
to incur resentment from others.</i>

12:39.680 --> 12:42.200
<i>While I was wondering
why such a murder had happened,</i>

12:42.280 --> 12:46.760
<i>I noticed a few strange folks
coming and going around the neighborhood.</i>

12:46.840 --> 12:48.960
<i>So I asked our detectives,</i>

12:49.040 --> 12:51.520
"Who are those people?
Aren't they suspicious?"

12:51.600 --> 12:53.680
I told them to look into it,

12:53.760 --> 12:57.120
and it turned out they were detectives
from the Gangnam Police Station.

12:57.200 --> 12:58.800
GUGI-DONG

12:58.880 --> 13:01.200
<i>I asked why detectives
from Gangnam were here,</i>

13:01.280 --> 13:03.280
<i>and they told me that there had been</i>

13:03.360 --> 13:08.360
<i>a similar case in Sinsa-dong,
and that's why they were here.</i>

13:09.360 --> 13:12.120
At the time, we didn't know
about the Sinsa-dong case.

13:19.880 --> 13:22.920
<i>When I was the Chief
of the Gangnam Police,</i>

13:23.520 --> 13:27.240
<i>I was in charge of South Korea's
number one economic district.</i>

13:27.320 --> 13:30.040
<i>That gave me a sense of pride
and the motivation</i>

13:30.120 --> 13:31.320
<i>to do my best.</i>

13:31.400 --> 13:32.400
CHIEF, GANGNAM POLICE STATION
DURING THE YOO YOUNG-CHUL CASE

13:34.440 --> 13:38.240
<i>I had caught many murder suspects.</i>

13:38.320 --> 13:40.520
<i>It allowed my staff to be promoted.</i>

13:41.040 --> 13:42.520
<i>We apprehended them with ease.</i>

13:44.640 --> 13:48.880
<i>We had a large investigation team
consisting of 200 people.</i>

13:49.680 --> 13:51.640
When there was a murder at the time,
you had to consider

13:51.720 --> 13:53.000
that all cases were connected.

13:53.080 --> 13:58.320
The Gugi-dong case was almost identical
to the Sinsa-dong case.

13:58.400 --> 14:00.320
OCTOBER 9, 2003

14:00.400 --> 14:02.720
SEPTEMBER 24, 2003
2 WEEKS EARLIER

14:02.800 --> 14:03.880
GUGI-DONG

14:06.440 --> 14:09.480
SINSA-DONG

14:14.080 --> 14:15.360
It's completely changed.

14:15.440 --> 14:16.720
Everything's changed.

14:19.240 --> 14:22.600
Back then,
it was an old house made of red bricks.

14:22.680 --> 14:24.960
There was a wall here.

14:25.640 --> 14:28.360
<i>There was an iron gate.</i>

14:32.080 --> 14:36.320
An elderly couple was killed here.

14:36.400 --> 14:42.480
The husband was
a retired university professor.

14:43.120 --> 14:45.280
<i>They were quite affluent.
They were well-off.</i>

14:45.920 --> 14:47.640
They were attacked
using a sharp-edged blunt weapon

14:47.720 --> 14:49.480
and had their skulls caved in.

14:50.160 --> 14:53.120
<i>But this case was rather unusual</i>

14:53.200 --> 14:56.880
<i>because there was
a three-drawer chest in the closet.</i>

14:56.960 --> 14:59.120
<i>The money in that drawer
remained untouched.</i>

14:59.200 --> 15:02.560
If it was a robbery, they would have
taken it along with the valuables.

15:02.640 --> 15:05.120
<i>That led me to believe that the case
wasn't a robbery-homicide,</i>

15:05.200 --> 15:06.920
<i>but the deed of someone
who knew the victims.</i>

15:07.000 --> 15:09.960
This is a textbook case in criminology.

15:10.040 --> 15:13.120
In a case like this,
we can catch the killer within a week

15:13.720 --> 15:16.600
if we investigate the people
around the victims.

15:16.680 --> 15:18.560
So when I heard about the Gugi-dong case,

15:18.640 --> 15:21.800
I suspected the assailant to be
an acquaintance of the victims,

15:21.880 --> 15:23.440
someone who knew them.

15:24.160 --> 15:26.080
But, as the Chief of Gangnam Police,

15:26.160 --> 15:29.360
there wasn't much I could do
since it happened outside my jurisdiction.

15:29.440 --> 15:31.360
Since we also had
an unsolved case at hand,

15:31.440 --> 15:32.880
their response would have been,

15:32.960 --> 15:34.360
"Go and solve your own case."

15:36.280 --> 15:38.120
<i>I went to the crime scene in Sinsa-dong.</i>

15:38.800 --> 15:42.080
I couldn't go inside,
so I had a look from the outside.

15:42.160 --> 15:43.640
Something was off.

15:43.720 --> 15:46.160
<i>Usually, each police station</i>

15:46.240 --> 15:49.400
<i>would be put in charge of the case
that occurred in their district.</i>

15:49.880 --> 15:53.840
And what was unique to us

15:53.920 --> 15:57.160
was the promotion system
that the police had in Korea.

15:57.240 --> 15:59.760
If there were many crimes
and not enough arrests,

15:59.840 --> 16:01.960
we would be evaluated badly.

16:02.040 --> 16:05.080
It's not that they were
going to keep the case unsolved,

16:05.160 --> 16:09.720
but they kept the case under wraps

16:09.800 --> 16:12.240
until they were sure
that they could make the arrest.

16:12.320 --> 16:16.120
They would only spread word about a case

16:16.200 --> 16:20.480
only after they had
apprehended the assailant

16:21.080 --> 16:25.400
for the case to be better reflected
on their evaluation.

16:25.480 --> 16:29.760
So, a lot of the time,
we were oblivious to the cases

16:29.840 --> 16:33.040
<i>that occurred outside of our jurisdiction.</i>

16:33.640 --> 16:35.480
Around 200 people were on the case.

16:36.040 --> 16:39.440
<i>It was a time when we concentrated
solely on murder cases.</i>

16:39.520 --> 16:44.000
Lesser offenses such as assault
were pushed to the side

16:44.080 --> 16:49.320
and we were only focused on
solving more violent crimes and murder.

16:50.360 --> 16:53.160
<i>Our detectives questioned people
one by one.</i>

16:53.240 --> 16:56.200
<i>They went around asking if people had seen
anyone suspicious in the area.</i>

16:56.280 --> 16:59.440
It was the most primitive method
of investigation.

16:59.520 --> 17:02.080
A complete joke by today's standards.

17:02.160 --> 17:06.280
Despite the continuous effort,
the case remained unsolved,

17:07.080 --> 17:12.640
and we began to think that we needed
to approach this case differently.

17:26.359 --> 17:29.640
I hope you are curious

17:29.720 --> 17:33.960
as to why criminal profilers
first came into existence.

17:35.360 --> 17:37.920
I was the first
in the Korean police force to introduce

17:38.000 --> 17:40.280
a type of investigative technique
called profiling.

17:40.360 --> 17:42.480
I'm known as Korea's first profiler.

17:42.560 --> 17:46.560
In Korea, I am the only one qualified
to be called a profiling master.

17:47.360 --> 17:50.760
<i>Profilers go to the crime scene
along with CSI,</i>

17:50.840 --> 17:53.280
and while the CSI collects evidence,

17:53.360 --> 17:57.320
profilers conduct a behavioral analysis

17:57.400 --> 17:59.760
of the events that took place
at the crime scene.

18:00.360 --> 18:03.680
Up until the 1980s, crimes in South Korea

18:04.560 --> 18:09.480
did not require CSI or criminal profilers.

18:10.000 --> 18:14.360
It was a time when every crime
had a clear motive.

18:18.480 --> 18:22.120
<i>But from the mid-1990s,</i>

18:23.360 --> 18:25.440
<i>crimes where the assailants</i>

18:26.280 --> 18:31.880
would take out their frustrations
on unspecified individuals began to occur.

18:38.520 --> 18:42.960
<i>Korean society experienced an immense
amount of change over a short period.</i>

18:44.160 --> 18:48.080
<i>In the recent 100 years
before modernization,</i>

18:48.160 --> 18:53.680
Korea was under
Japan's barbaric colonial rule.

18:54.720 --> 18:59.000
<i>When World War II ended,
the Korean peninsula was split in half.</i>

19:01.840 --> 19:04.080
<i>For a long time,
we lived together harmoniously,</i>

19:04.160 --> 19:07.640
but then there was a war
where we killed each other.

19:08.200 --> 19:10.160
<i>The economy was also
completely devastated.</i>

19:10.720 --> 19:15.320
<i>From 1963 to 1980,</i>

19:15.800 --> 19:18.080
South Korea experienced
tremendous economic growth,

19:18.160 --> 19:19.880
known as the Miracle on the Han River.

19:20.840 --> 19:23.400
That was a time when everyone thought

19:23.480 --> 19:25.520
Korea was one
of the better-developed countries.

19:25.600 --> 19:28.600
But those thoughts were dashed
in the early 2000s

19:28.680 --> 19:32.200
and society fell into a deep abyss.

19:39.640 --> 19:41.920
The Korean currency lost its value

19:42.000 --> 19:44.160
and foreign exchange
dropped to the bottom.

19:44.240 --> 19:47.320
The government has eventually made
the decision

19:47.400 --> 19:49.360
to request emergency funds from the IMF.

19:49.440 --> 19:51.520
<i>It is expected that the government</i>

19:51.600 --> 19:54.160
<i>would be applying to receive
around 30 billion dollars in aid.</i>

19:54.840 --> 19:59.040
<i>Then after the debt
was somehow repaid and overcome,</i>

19:59.120 --> 20:02.280
the people who survived the situation
were solely harvesting

20:02.360 --> 20:03.640
the fruit of success,

20:03.720 --> 20:07.120
while the people who fell behind
did not know how to move forward.

20:07.200 --> 20:11.480
<i>We were in a situation where
there was no safety net in society.</i>

20:11.560 --> 20:14.080
The people who fell behind
had no place to go.

20:15.120 --> 20:18.360
A lot of people became homeless,
lost their jobs,

20:18.440 --> 20:20.120
and ended up on the streets.

20:21.120 --> 20:24.040
<i>Families were split up,
and horrible things happened.</i>

20:24.120 --> 20:25.920
And after that,

20:26.000 --> 20:27.520
the rich got richer,

20:27.600 --> 20:29.960
and the poor got poorer.

20:31.120 --> 20:33.160
<i>This sense of deprivation
was not the problem,</i>

20:33.240 --> 20:37.280
but the problem was how that deprivation
turned into alienation.

20:37.880 --> 20:39.560
<i>A feeling that something is wrong,</i>

20:39.640 --> 20:42.520
<i>and that one is deprived of some things</i>

20:43.320 --> 20:46.600
eventually leads to
a feeling of alienation that one feels

20:46.680 --> 20:50.640
when one has been deprived of the chance
to participate as a member of society.

20:50.720 --> 20:54.680
That leads to people
not being able to feel any guilt

20:54.760 --> 21:00.960
when they attack others
out of the frustration they feel.

21:02.000 --> 21:05.920
It was an era of stark contrasts.

21:09.760 --> 21:11.480
SEOUL RESCUE SERVICES

21:11.560 --> 21:16.600
<i>I remember it as the time
when assault cases increased.</i>

21:16.680 --> 21:21.040
<i>Cases involving the kidnapping of children
and women</i>

21:21.120 --> 21:23.280
<i>were happening frequently.</i>

21:23.360 --> 21:27.000
Kidnapping cases asked
for high ransoms to be paid.

21:27.920 --> 21:32.560
<i>I was dealing with gangsters,
so danger was always lurking.</i>

21:33.640 --> 21:37.000
I padded my chest underneath my clothes

21:37.080 --> 21:41.400
in case I was attacked with a knife.

21:42.400 --> 21:44.840
<i>The crimes that occur
in advanced capitalist countries</i>

21:44.920 --> 21:47.360
<i>such as the US, Japan or Europe,</i>

21:47.440 --> 21:49.240
<i>had finally started happening
in Korea, too.</i>

21:49.840 --> 21:52.160
I am still upset that I wasn't able
to kill those who deserved to die.

21:52.240 --> 21:53.760
More people should have died.

21:55.520 --> 21:58.600
Many criminal psychologists call it
"indiscriminate crime."

21:58.680 --> 22:01.880
This includes serial murders.

22:01.960 --> 22:04.080
It is also called a motiveless crime.

22:04.160 --> 22:05.920
That was how society was,

22:06.000 --> 22:11.040
but the citizens at wide
did not realize it then.

22:11.120 --> 22:13.920
But the police were aware of it.

22:20.840 --> 22:22.760
<i>I was silent on the outside</i>

22:22.840 --> 22:24.040
SILENCE

22:24.720 --> 22:26.520
<i>but I was thundering on the inside.</i>

22:26.600 --> 22:28.360
THUNDER

22:34.520 --> 22:37.640
<i>I did it to kill society.</i>

22:39.440 --> 22:42.960
<i>Even in history,
whenever society was in turmoil,</i>

22:44.000 --> 22:47.400
<i>there had been uprisings where the people
took matters into their own hands.</i>

22:47.480 --> 22:48.480
UPRISINGS

22:48.560 --> 22:51.760
<i>When I finally came
to the bitter realization</i>

22:52.440 --> 22:54.720
<i>that money was the only thing
that mattered,</i>

22:54.800 --> 22:58.760
<i>I even thought of enforcing
the punishment myself.</i>

23:12.440 --> 23:15.040
<i>The investigation team had seen
no progress at that point.</i>

23:15.920 --> 23:18.000
When the second incident occurred,

23:18.080 --> 23:20.360
I had an inkling that the two cases
were connected.

23:21.680 --> 23:24.920
However, there was no conclusive evidence

23:25.000 --> 23:28.160
it was difficult to say for sure
that the two cases were committed

23:28.240 --> 23:29.240
by a single assailant.

23:29.320 --> 23:30.160
FIRST CASE, SINSA-DONG
SECOND CASE, GUGI-DONG

23:30.240 --> 23:36.040
The task at hand is like solving a puzzle,
piece by piece.

23:36.520 --> 23:40.880
Trying to catch
a serial killer as a profiler

23:40.960 --> 23:45.920
is not as exciting and full of twists
and turns as people imagine.

23:46.000 --> 23:47.600
Knowing there will be more deaths

23:47.680 --> 23:49.800
and the guilt from being unable
to prevent that death

23:49.880 --> 23:51.800
are all a part of the experience.

23:52.840 --> 23:57.480
<i>I was the sole profiling personnel
who was dispatched to the scene.</i>

23:59.560 --> 24:02.720
<i>The first thought I had when I began
analyzing the second case was…</i>

24:02.800 --> 24:06.200
I had never seen
that kind of murder weapon before.

24:06.280 --> 24:08.680
I was focused on finding
the murder weapon.

24:09.440 --> 24:13.560
<i>We always had a lot of suspicions
about the murder weapon.</i>

24:13.640 --> 24:16.520
<i>We obtained different tools
and hung them on the wall,</i>

24:16.600 --> 24:18.760
guessing which could be the murder weapon.

24:18.840 --> 24:20.600
We got together and discussed it.

24:24.480 --> 24:28.200
We couldn’t find the murder weapon
among the tools available on the market.

24:28.280 --> 24:32.360
Even something like a hammer

24:32.440 --> 24:36.800
wouldn't have been able to leave
a dent like that on the skull.

24:36.880 --> 24:38.760
What in the world was the murder weapon?

24:38.840 --> 24:39.840
GANGNAM CITY CONTROL CENTER

24:39.920 --> 24:42.840
<i>At that time, in Seoul,
as we were the Seoul Metropolitan Police,</i>

24:42.920 --> 24:46.520
we were mobilized to all the murder cases
that occurred within the city.

24:46.600 --> 24:50.200
We communicated very closely
with the investigation teams.

24:50.280 --> 24:52.960
<i>We would repeatedly visit
scenes where there wasn't much evidence.</i>

24:53.040 --> 24:54.840
<i>Since the crime scenes
were well-preserved,</i>

24:54.920 --> 24:59.400
we would run additional forensic tests
to find any evidence we may have missed.

24:59.960 --> 25:04.040
I pulled up all the murder cases

25:04.120 --> 25:10.320
that took place in the country
in the past 30 years before that

25:10.400 --> 25:11.960
and looked at the statistics.

25:12.040 --> 25:15.880
What weapons were used
on which parts of the body,

25:15.960 --> 25:18.680
and what parts of the body
were attacked the most.

25:19.280 --> 25:21.200
It turned out that the head

25:21.280 --> 25:23.760
was the most frequently attacked
in crimes caused by anger or resentment.

25:24.440 --> 25:27.960
<i>I came to the conclusion
that the assailant was emotionally driven</i>

25:28.040 --> 25:29.640
<i>to act out his rage.</i>

25:30.680 --> 25:33.360
<i>There was no evidence that
he had been searching for valuables,</i>

25:33.440 --> 25:36.480
<i>and he had left the cash untouched.</i>

25:37.360 --> 25:43.120
So I concluded that
he was not like other criminals.

25:43.200 --> 25:46.400
<i>So amidst the investigation,</i>

25:46.480 --> 25:49.120
<i>we were looking for suspects</i>

25:49.200 --> 25:53.240
who had mental health issues.

25:54.000 --> 25:57.760
<i>There was a public hospital
in Junggok-dong, Seoul.</i>

25:58.240 --> 26:00.120
It was a government-run hospital

26:00.200 --> 26:04.040
that treated people who suffered from
behavioral disorders.

26:04.680 --> 26:05.840
<i>We visited that hospital.</i>

26:06.560 --> 26:12.200
<i>Once there,
we asked if there had been any patients</i>

26:12.280 --> 26:15.160
with such violent tendencies,

26:15.240 --> 26:19.800
but they couldn't recall anyone who had
such traits in that age demographic.

26:20.440 --> 26:22.000
<i>We were at a dead end.</i>

26:22.080 --> 26:23.880
<i>We were frustrated.</i>

26:24.840 --> 26:28.400
I remember worrying a lot about

26:28.480 --> 26:31.080
what we knew
or didn't know about this killer.

26:31.160 --> 26:33.680
We worried so much

26:34.240 --> 26:37.360
that my teammates and I
found it hard to eat.

26:38.880 --> 26:41.000
But then came the third case.

26:42.640 --> 26:45.240
OCTOBER 16, 2003

26:45.320 --> 26:46.800
GUGI-DONG, SINSA-DONG

26:46.880 --> 26:49.240
SINSA-DONG

26:49.320 --> 26:52.360
SAMSEONG-DONG

26:55.600 --> 26:57.400
<i>When profilers go to the crime scene,</i>

26:57.480 --> 26:59.360
<i>we go with a fairly cold heart.</i>

26:59.440 --> 27:05.080
We leave our personal feelings behind
like sympathy or horror.

27:05.640 --> 27:08.600
This is to draw accurate conclusions
and determine exactly what has happened.

27:08.680 --> 27:13.040
So we keep a composed attitude
to be able to control ourselves.

27:13.840 --> 27:17.920
<i>The procedure for going
to a crime scene is</i>

27:18.000 --> 27:20.520
<i>to have five CSI agents
team up with a profiler.</i>

27:20.600 --> 27:25.000
We are sent together
whenever there are new cases.

27:25.920 --> 27:30.240
If there is a murder case,
we're the first to be at the scene.

27:32.280 --> 27:33.520
<i>He entered the house…</i>

27:36.840 --> 27:39.200
<i>dragged the grandmother into the bathroom…</i>

27:42.120 --> 27:43.520
<i>and attacked her there.</i>

27:44.320 --> 27:46.240
<i>There was a lot of blood.</i>

27:47.360 --> 27:51.000
It was as if that chilling air

27:51.080 --> 27:54.360
that filled the house during the crime
still hung about the scene.

27:54.440 --> 27:55.320
KCSI

27:55.400 --> 27:59.200
<i>Even the senior detectives who were
on their way upstairs came back down.</i>

28:01.280 --> 28:03.440
<i>We were wondering what was wrong with us</i>

28:05.560 --> 28:09.640
<i>since we had all felt that ominous air
hanging about the place at the time.</i>

28:10.160 --> 28:14.040
That is how horrifying and terrifying
the crime scene was.

28:15.480 --> 28:17.040
<i>We thoroughly inspected the scene.</i>

28:17.680 --> 28:20.840
Then we carried on inspecting
outside the house

28:22.000 --> 28:23.480
<i>and noticed the outdoor AC unit.</i>

28:24.440 --> 28:28.640
<i>The unit was stuck onto the wall.
We examined it closely.</i>

28:30.920 --> 28:34.360
<i>And when we took a closer look,</i>

28:34.440 --> 28:37.680
<i>we found a very faint shoe print
on the AC unit.</i>

28:38.600 --> 28:42.440
"Did the killer step on the AC unit

28:42.520 --> 28:45.840
to get a better view of the house?

28:45.920 --> 28:48.440
Did he step on the AC unit
to get into the house?"

28:48.520 --> 28:50.720
Those were the thoughts that
ran through my head.

28:51.200 --> 28:52.400
GUGI-DONG, SINSA-DONG, SAMSEONG-DONG

28:52.480 --> 28:54.280
<i>We had discovered two shoe prints.</i>

28:54.360 --> 28:57.000
<i>They were each from the Samseong-dong
and Gugi-dong crime scenes.</i>

28:58.120 --> 29:01.520
<i>Looking at the pattern
of the two shoe prints…</i>

29:04.520 --> 29:05.840
they were the same.

29:08.160 --> 29:11.880
<i>We didn't find any shoe prints while
in Sinsa-dong during the first case.</i>

29:11.960 --> 29:16.800
<i>But, judging by the shape of the wounds,
it looked like the same weapon was used</i>

29:16.880 --> 29:19.480
<i>in the Samseong-dong,
Gugi-dong, and Sinsa-dong cases.</i>

29:19.560 --> 29:21.160
GUGI-DONG, SINSA-DONG, SAMSEONG-DONG

29:21.240 --> 29:23.320
<i>What I thought then was</i>

29:23.880 --> 29:26.800
that these were a chain of crimes
committed by a serial murderer

29:26.880 --> 29:30.120
with an unknown motive.

29:36.800 --> 29:38.120
There have been a series of murders

29:38.200 --> 29:40.440
targeting the elderly living in a wealthy
neighborhood in Gangnam.

29:40.520 --> 29:43.440
<i>The victims were killed by being struck
on the head with a blunt weapon.</i>

29:43.520 --> 29:45.880
<i>Their money and valuables
were left untouched.</i>

29:45.960 --> 29:48.360
<i>Citizens are beginning
to grow more anxious.</i>

29:48.440 --> 29:51.880
The Seoul Police Agency
had been denying it,

29:52.400 --> 29:54.240
saying the cases weren't related.

29:54.320 --> 29:57.160
But the reporters already believed
that it was the same killer.

29:57.240 --> 30:01.560
<i>I felt that I had to be more careful
and lock up the doors.</i>

30:01.640 --> 30:03.920
<i>So I even locked
all the doors to the bathroom.</i>

30:04.000 --> 30:07.920
At first, I thought to myself,
"Could this be a serial murder case?"

30:08.000 --> 30:11.760
But as more cases arose, we became sure

30:11.840 --> 30:15.000
that this was committed by one person,
that it's a serial murder case.

30:15.080 --> 30:19.560
The commissioner said,
"Is there another one?"

30:20.040 --> 30:22.680
When I told him it may be serial,
he flipped out and said,

30:23.560 --> 30:26.760
“How anxious do you think
the citizens would be

30:26.840 --> 30:28.800
if there was a serial killer in Seoul?"

30:28.880 --> 30:32.040
He told me not to ever mention it again.

30:32.120 --> 30:34.000
I used the term "serial killer…"

30:34.560 --> 30:37.160
I shared the documents I had printed out
with the police chiefs,

30:37.240 --> 30:41.480
and one of my colleagues
called me and said,

30:41.560 --> 30:46.320
"Why are you going around
saying it's a serial murder case?"

30:46.400 --> 30:48.080
He told me to stop talking nonsense.

30:48.640 --> 30:52.400
We are speculating that the killer
is an acquaintance of the family.

30:52.960 --> 30:55.720
<i>It was the opinion
of the local police agency</i>

30:55.800 --> 30:58.520
<i>that it shouldn’t be seen
as a related crime.</i>

30:58.600 --> 31:04.560
That was a mistake
on the Seoul Police Agency's part.

31:04.640 --> 31:06.200
A mistake indeed.

31:06.280 --> 31:08.880
NOVEMBER 18, 2003

31:15.000 --> 31:17.440
<i>I heard that a fish's IQ is 0,7.</i>

31:20.000 --> 31:24.320
<i>So what is the IQ of the fisherman
who fails to catch the fish?</i>

31:29.800 --> 31:32.400
<i>One out of ten people die daily,</i>

31:32.480 --> 31:34.440
<i>but the police just go on patrols.</i>

31:34.920 --> 31:37.000
<i>They work so hard to catch the killers</i>

31:37.640 --> 31:39.880
<i>only to lose them again and again.</i>

31:42.520 --> 31:44.760
<i>Which country do you think
these cops are from?</i>

31:49.800 --> 31:52.080
<i>At around 3:00 p.m. today,
a fire broke out</i>

31:52.160 --> 31:55.000
<i>in a two-story detached house
in Hyehwa-dong, Jongno-gu, Seoul.</i>

31:55.080 --> 31:58.320
GUGI-DONG, HYEHWA-DONG
SINSA-DONG, SAMSEONG-DONG

31:58.400 --> 32:00.520
<i>Both Kim, the 87-year-old
owner of the house,</i>

32:01.000 --> 32:05.000
<i>and Baek, a 50-year-old housekeeper,
were found dead.</i>

32:05.080 --> 32:08.000
He's my father. What happened?

32:08.080 --> 32:09.680
I talked to him on the phone this morning.

32:09.760 --> 32:12.200
<i>In the living room,
a one-year-old boy survived</i>

32:12.280 --> 32:15.440
<i>under his blanket
and was taken to the hospital.</i>

32:15.520 --> 32:17.480
Because someone set fire to the house,

32:17.560 --> 32:20.240
we thought that it was different
from the first three cases.

32:20.320 --> 32:22.080
That's what we thought at first.

32:22.160 --> 32:25.720
<i>Judging from the damage done
to the safe on the second floor</i>

32:25.800 --> 32:28.800
<i>and the fact that the house
was in an affluent neighborhood,</i>

32:28.880 --> 32:32.440
<i>the police suspect the case to be
a robbery-homicide that ended with arson.</i>

32:32.520 --> 32:36.040
<i>The owner of the house was laying in bed
with stab wounds all over the body</i>

32:36.120 --> 32:38.600
<i>and signs of blunt force trauma
on the head.</i>

32:38.680 --> 32:41.280
<i>Both victims were found partially burnt.</i>

32:41.880 --> 32:46.320
There were signs that the killer had tried
to break into the safe, but that was it.

32:47.240 --> 32:50.880
<i>The crucial piece of evidence was</i>

32:50.960 --> 32:54.160
<i>the matching shoe print
we found in the Hyehwa-dong case.</i>

32:56.040 --> 32:58.880
<i>The CSI confirmed that the faint
shoe print they found in Gugi-dong</i>

32:58.960 --> 33:02.680
<i>and the one found
in Samseong-dong during the third case</i>

33:03.160 --> 33:06.040
<i>matched this new shoe print.</i>

33:06.120 --> 33:07.560
GUGI-DONG, SAMSEONG-DONG, HYEHWA-DONG

33:07.640 --> 33:09.560
<i>As such evidence began to surface,</i>

33:09.640 --> 33:13.240
we concluded that
these cases were all related.

33:13.800 --> 33:16.680
From that point on,

33:16.760 --> 33:21.720
the term "serial murder"
was used by the press.

33:23.960 --> 33:28.200
He may have tried to trick us
or get rid of the evidence.

33:28.280 --> 33:31.960
Or he could have just been toying with us.

33:36.120 --> 33:38.840
A combined investigations HQ was set up,

33:38.920 --> 33:41.120
but it was kept confidential.

33:41.200 --> 33:46.360
Each investigation team
from the separate police stations

33:46.440 --> 33:48.200
joined forces to form one unit

33:48.280 --> 33:51.920
<i>and started working together
to investigate the murders.</i>

33:52.680 --> 33:56.680
We pulled the records of the cell phones
that had pinged near the scenes.

33:56.760 --> 33:59.200
<i>All the detectives</i>

33:59.280 --> 34:04.320
<i>from the three precincts went out daily
to track their whereabouts.</i>

34:04.960 --> 34:09.600
It was a long and tedious process.

34:09.680 --> 34:11.520
To be honest, it wasn't for the best,

34:11.600 --> 34:13.080
but there wasn't enough evidence.

34:14.480 --> 34:16.400
<i>We blocked off the roads at night</i>

34:16.480 --> 34:18.719
<i>and questioned every car that drove by
and checked the trunks.</i>

34:18.800 --> 34:22.480
During the day,
if we saw any suspicious individuals,

34:23.000 --> 34:25.679
we searched their bags
to see if they carried a hammer.

34:26.400 --> 34:27.480
<i>These random searches</i>

34:27.560 --> 34:30.639
<i>must have been very unpleasant
for the public.</i>

34:30.719 --> 34:32.639
It was truly
a primitive containment strategy.

34:32.719 --> 34:36.800
We checked what kinds of shoes
had a similar pattern on the sole.

34:36.880 --> 34:40.719
They were Buffalo shoes.

34:40.800 --> 34:45.800
We were able to confirm that
the serial killer is wearing these shoes.

34:45.880 --> 34:49.280
We even tried to predict the next murder
by using the Korean alphabet.

34:49.360 --> 34:50.800
Gugi-dong.

34:50.880 --> 34:53.679
"Gu" and "Gi" both start
with the same consonant.

34:53.760 --> 34:58.120
Sinsa-dong.
"Sin" and "Sa" have the same consonant.

34:58.199 --> 35:02.760
Samseong-dong also has the same consonant.

35:02.840 --> 35:05.440
So we thought the killer
only committed crimes

35:05.520 --> 35:09.640
in neighborhoods where their names
share the same consonant.

35:09.720 --> 35:11.560
Hyehwa-dong also has the same consonant.

35:11.640 --> 35:13.600
It was a very strange case.

35:13.680 --> 35:15.360
So we thought the killer might target

35:16.080 --> 35:17.560
Suseo next.

35:17.640 --> 35:21.000
Police chiefs in charge of precincts
with identical consonants

35:21.080 --> 35:22.760
began to grow anxious.

35:22.840 --> 35:24.120
But it all led to nothing,

35:24.200 --> 35:27.400
so we were just going around in circles

35:27.480 --> 35:29.600
with no progress whatsoever.

35:29.680 --> 35:31.440
I thought,
"How are we going to solve this case?

35:31.520 --> 35:36.080
How anxious will our citizens be
if such a case occurs again?"

35:36.160 --> 35:38.960
That's what had me worried the most.

35:39.040 --> 35:41.600
We ran 24-hour shifts at the time.

35:41.680 --> 35:43.800
We worked insanely hard.

35:44.480 --> 35:48.760
I didn't go home.
I ate and slept at the office.

35:48.840 --> 35:52.040
But still, the results were not reflective
of how hard I was working.

35:52.720 --> 35:57.000
I had a clear goal,

35:57.680 --> 35:59.400
and so while it was shocking,

35:59.960 --> 36:06.400
<i>the focus was to get a step closer
to the killer in any way possible.</i>

36:07.040 --> 36:08.680
<i>And at that time,</i>

36:08.760 --> 36:13.920
we were constantly working
rather than clocking in and out of work.

36:14.000 --> 36:16.040
SEOUL METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY

36:16.720 --> 36:20.440
<i>When I was at the office,</i>

36:20.520 --> 36:25.040
<i>I kept going through the videos and photos
from the scenes</i>

36:25.520 --> 36:27.920
<i>to see if I had missed anything.</i>

36:28.480 --> 36:30.600
We were definitely frustrated.

36:30.680 --> 36:34.880
This type of case was unprecedented
in Korea at the time,

36:34.960 --> 36:37.040
and we had no idea

36:37.120 --> 36:40.200
what type of person the killer was,

36:40.920 --> 36:43.920
so it was very very taxing,
both mentally and physically.

36:44.960 --> 36:48.400
<i>Everything was uncertain
and we felt powerless.</i>

36:49.080 --> 36:53.600
<i>My self-esteem plummeted</i>

36:54.280 --> 36:58.480
<i>because I didn't know
what it was that I had to do.</i>

37:03.960 --> 37:05.280
<i>Ultimately, I felt guilty</i>

37:05.360 --> 37:10.760
because there would be another murder
if we weren't able to solve the case.

37:10.840 --> 37:14.880
There were bound to be
more elderly victims

37:15.560 --> 37:18.040
in the future.

37:23.520 --> 37:26.440
<i>At the time,
there were barely any CCTVs in Seoul.</i>

37:27.440 --> 37:33.960
<i>But on the main road
leading to the fourth crime scene,</i>

37:34.920 --> 37:37.440
<i>there was a huge building.</i>

37:39.080 --> 37:40.160
<i>In that building,</i>

37:40.240 --> 37:45.440
<i>a CCTV camera had been installed inside
in order to monitor the employees</i>

37:45.520 --> 37:47.920
entering and leaving the building.

37:48.760 --> 37:52.720
<i>The CCTV camera was facing
towards the inside of the building,</i>

37:52.800 --> 37:55.320
<i>so the road was only partially shown.</i>

37:55.400 --> 37:57.880
<i>However, there was footage
that was captured on camera…</i>

38:05.240 --> 38:08.520
<i>that we showed the victims' family.</i>

38:08.600 --> 38:12.760
We asked them if they had
perhaps seen that person before.

38:12.840 --> 38:15.880
They said they couldn't recognize
the person since it was just his back

38:15.960 --> 38:17.400
and the footage was taken from a distance,

38:17.960 --> 38:21.200
<i>but they recognized the clothes
he was wearing.</i>

38:21.920 --> 38:26.680
<i>It was a jacket
belonging to the victim's husband.</i>

38:27.160 --> 38:32.040
So, we could specify
this man as the killer.

38:33.800 --> 38:37.240
<i>The footage only showed him from the back.</i>

38:37.320 --> 38:40.360
We needed his face to be shown,

38:40.440 --> 38:42.160
but the footage didn't show
his face at all.

38:42.240 --> 38:44.920
So we couldn't identify the killer
using that footage.

38:45.000 --> 38:48.760
<i>But nevertheless, it was proof that</i>

38:48.840 --> 38:52.120
<i>the killer was a real person,
not some kind of a ghost.</i>

38:52.800 --> 38:54.560
<i>Many people could have walked by,</i>

38:55.360 --> 38:59.520
<i>but luckily, the killer walked past
the front of the building at that time,</i>

38:59.600 --> 39:01.080
<i>exposing his back on camera.</i>

39:03.400 --> 39:06.560
We were torn after we found this footage

39:07.120 --> 39:10.080
<i>on whether we should use this footage
to put out an APB.</i>

39:14.120 --> 39:16.600
<i>There were diverging opinions
within the investigation team.</i>

39:16.680 --> 39:18.640
Everyone had a different opinion.

39:19.120 --> 39:22.120
It wasn't about whether we agreed
to go public with it or not.

39:23.080 --> 39:28.280
<i>If the footage was made public, the killer
might change his patterns or methods,</i>

39:28.360 --> 39:30.600
<i>and tracking him would become
even more difficult.</i>

39:30.680 --> 39:32.880
<i>Or they might just stop</i>

39:32.960 --> 39:36.160
<i>if we scared him with the idea that
he could be captured on camera.</i>

39:36.240 --> 39:40.200
<i>That might influence him psychologically
to stop committing any more murders.</i>

39:41.160 --> 39:44.240
The decision to make the footage public

39:45.160 --> 39:47.640
<i>was because there was nothing else
that we could do.</i>

39:48.280 --> 39:53.120
<i>In a way, it was a last resort.</i>

39:54.040 --> 39:57.760
<i>Even though it was
only five to ten minutes,</i>

39:57.840 --> 40:02.080
<i>it felt like 500, or even 5,000 years.</i>

40:02.160 --> 40:04.400
<i>We were definitely under stress</i>

40:04.480 --> 40:06.520
<i>because making the wrong decision</i>

40:06.600 --> 40:08.640
<i>could lead to more victims.</i>

40:08.720 --> 40:11.120
<i>So it was an incredibly difficult decision
to make.</i>

40:14.800 --> 40:17.360
The police are one step closer
to identifying the suspect

40:17.440 --> 40:19.360
in the series of murders
targeting senior citizens in Seoul.

40:19.440 --> 40:21.920
A man in his twenties
who is believed to be the culprit

40:22.000 --> 40:25.320
was caught on a CCTV camera
near one of the scenes.

40:25.400 --> 40:29.520
I wanted to make a public announcement
to tell the killer

40:29.600 --> 40:33.040
that his actions could be caught on camera
while he was committing crimes

40:33.120 --> 40:34.480
wherever he may be.

40:35.080 --> 40:36.920
<i>The shoe print found at the scene
is said to match</i>

40:37.000 --> 40:39.600
<i>those from the scenes
of the Gugi-dong and Samseong-dong cases,</i>

40:39.680 --> 40:43.360
<i>so the police are currently investigating
the possibility of a serial murder case.</i>

40:43.440 --> 40:46.160
Ultimately, the word "serial"
had to come out.

40:46.240 --> 40:48.160
When the time came,
it was widely reported.

40:49.360 --> 40:51.600
<i>With a 50 million won reward,</i>

40:51.680 --> 40:55.400
<i>the police distributed 10,000 leaflets
nationwide,</i>

40:55.480 --> 40:58.520
<i>showing a photo of this man from behind.
He is estimated to be 168cm tall.</i>

40:58.600 --> 41:02.880
The investigation became very quiet.

41:04.080 --> 41:05.240
<i>When he stopped…</i>

41:05.320 --> 41:08.080
<i>I'm not sure why,
but the killings stopped.</i>

41:09.000 --> 41:10.600
<i>We kept analyzing the scenes
over and over,</i>

41:10.680 --> 41:14.440
<i>looking at what needs to be considered and
how we'd go about interviewing witnesses.</i>

41:14.520 --> 41:17.000
At the time, we were all feeling

41:17.080 --> 41:19.560
that there was nothing left
to investigate.

41:20.160 --> 41:23.040
The killer had stopped by then,

41:23.840 --> 41:25.320
so we were at our wit's end.

41:32.400 --> 41:36.960
<i>We were under a lot of pressure
because we hadn't apprehended the killer.</i>

41:37.840 --> 41:40.280
Such murders occurred,

41:40.360 --> 41:44.360
and it remained unsolved.

41:44.840 --> 41:49.000
But there was another terrible case
waiting for us.

41:52.520 --> 41:56.120
KCSI

42:05.480 --> 42:06.520
<i>Hello.</i>

42:07.280 --> 42:08.920
<i>This is the despicable human,</i>

42:09.000 --> 42:10.240
<i>Yoo Young-chul.</i>

42:14.920 --> 42:17.480
<i>I wished that lightning
would burn everything down</i>

42:18.960 --> 42:21.560
<i>and that a storm would swallow it all up.</i>

42:22.520 --> 42:25.760
<i>Because of such madness,
I felt the strong urge to destroy</i>

42:25.840 --> 42:27.040
<i>and hurt people like a madman.</i>

42:27.120 --> 42:29.960
<i>And I was intoxicated by the act
without even realizing it.</i>
