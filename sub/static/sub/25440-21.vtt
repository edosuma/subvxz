00:50.282 --> 00:52.228

01:08.118 --> 01:10.467
<i>somewhere I'm never
supposed to come back from?</i>

01:10.555 --> 01:12.250
Adira's lying to you!

01:12.414 --> 01:14.315
She... she might
have you think

01:14.402 --> 01:16.617
she's helping you
to find your destiny,

01:16.789 --> 01:21.391
but if you go to the Dark
Kingdom, you're doomed!

01:25.713 --> 01:29.982
Everyone must leave now!

power that lies within it

01:51.820 --> 01:54.860
be forever wiped
from existence!

02:00.253 --> 02:01.753
Yah!

02:16.609 --> 02:18.141
We made it.

02:19.289 --> 02:21.305
The Dark Kingdom.

02:21.703 --> 02:23.350
Yep. We just need
a way to get

02:23.438 --> 02:25.266
the ol' camper
down there.

02:26.307 --> 02:28.240
Whoa, whoa...
Wait, wait, wait!

02:31.916 --> 02:34.665
No! Not again!

02:35.633 --> 02:37.001
It served us well.

02:37.152 --> 02:40.195
Oh, no! All my
clean clothes!

02:40.283 --> 02:42.423
Shorty, you didn't have
any clean clothes.

02:42.541 --> 02:46.369
Psh. Well, not with that
attitude, I didn't.

02:50.813 --> 02:53.267
Your destiny
awaits, Princess.

02:53.801 --> 02:55.182
You sure you're
ready for this?

02:55.376 --> 02:57.976
I just wish I knew
what this is.

02:58.064 --> 03:02.093
I mean, Demanitus said
if I don't grab the MoonStone,

03:02.181 --> 03:04.384
the black rocks will
destroy everything.

03:04.480 --> 03:06.968
But I have no idea
what to expect

03:07.056 --> 03:09.744
to happen to me when I do.

03:10.369 --> 03:12.366
I don't know.

Hey!

05:32.056 --> 05:34.046
"When Rapunzel enters
the Dark Kingdom,

05:34.134 --> 05:36.580
one of her team will
turn against her."

05:37.111 --> 05:38.673
I don't want to believe
it either, Max,

05:38.761 --> 05:42.455
but Demanitus has been right
about everything so far.

05:45.955 --> 05:49.406
No, I won't tell her. Ugh. I
am not going to argue with you.

05:49.494 --> 05:51.874
Look, this is the last time
I ever ask a horse's advice

05:51.962 --> 05:53.460
about an ancient monkey
scientist's warning.

05:56.126 --> 05:57.773
Do me a favor
and let's just keep

05:57.861 --> 06:00.476
this whole thing to
ourselves, all right?

06:00.564 --> 06:02.564
Hey, what's this?

06:03.048 --> 06:04.705
This is so much fun.

06:05.571 --> 06:08.108
No one
is gonna turn against me.

06:08.283 --> 06:10.072
Demanitus has to be wrong.

06:10.166 --> 06:12.728
Everyone's had my
back this far.

06:12.837 --> 06:14.585
They're not
gonna stop now.

06:14.673 --> 06:16.476
Unless they think
they're protecting you.

06:16.564 --> 06:18.728
After all, that's how
Cass injured her hand.

06:18.822 --> 06:20.125
You don't think
that Cass...

06:20.213 --> 06:21.705
Look, look, look,
I love Cass.

06:21.793 --> 06:23.242
She's become like
a sister to me.

06:23.330 --> 06:25.031
Granted, you know,
an annoying sister

06:25.119 --> 06:26.699
you only put up with
because you have to,

06:26.786 --> 06:29.635
but maybe we should,
ya know, keep an eye on...

06:29.722 --> 06:31.137
Ahh!

06:32.825 --> 06:35.574
What is that
bird doing?

06:35.661 --> 06:38.311
Uh, maybe you should try
asking his friends.

06:54.080 --> 06:56.247
They're all following
that bird.

07:01.721 --> 07:03.988
Pascal, lead 'em
back this way!

07:13.199 --> 07:14.680
Get away from me!

07:15.935 --> 07:18.069
Whose stupid plan was this?
Aaack!

07:28.681 --> 07:30.748
Never more.

07:31.100 --> 07:34.153
Wonderful. Even the birds
in this kingdom are hostile.

07:35.314 --> 07:38.975
It's gonna take a lot more than
a bunch of birds to stop us!

07:40.560 --> 07:43.077
Uh, something like this,
for example.

07:46.593 --> 07:49.342
Yep. That is
a long way down.

07:49.570 --> 07:52.319
Long way
down, long way down.

07:53.717 --> 07:55.488
Help!

07:55.639 --> 07:57.952
Did you hear that?
Someone needs help!

07:58.405 --> 08:01.631
Anybody have any idea how
we get across this thing?

08:11.457 --> 08:13.973
The interlopers 
still approach?

08:14.075 --> 08:16.092
Then we've got
work to do.

08:21.196 --> 08:22.962
I found a way across!

08:24.131 --> 08:25.824
Ta-da!

08:27.580 --> 08:31.074
C'mon. Who's afraid of
a little old gondola?

08:32.770 --> 08:37.072
Yeah, high-fives!
I love these attitudes!

08:37.159 --> 08:39.265
Blondie, that thing's
a good 50 yards out there.

08:39.352 --> 08:40.832
I can get it.

08:41.145 --> 08:42.363
I'll get across,

08:42.451 --> 08:44.399
then wheel it back here
for the rest of you.

08:44.653 --> 08:46.957
Um, I don't know, Cass.

08:47.082 --> 08:48.854
Trust me. I can do it.

08:48.942 --> 08:50.986
Of course, I trust you...

08:51.074 --> 08:55.543
Um, we trust you,
but your hand.

08:55.668 --> 08:59.035
Even with my hand, I'm still
the most agile of all of us.

09:10.449 --> 09:13.265
I mean, you'd think she
would've taken the heavy armor off

09:13.352 --> 09:16.153
before climbing on a flimsy
cable over an endless chasm.

09:16.241 --> 09:18.423
Uh, maybe she's making
a fashion statement.

09:18.565 --> 09:21.395
Honey, armor is
so last fall.

09:21.550 --> 09:23.081
Whaa...

09:30.369 --> 09:33.057
Wow, that takes
a lot of guts.

09:33.145 --> 09:35.504
I guess she really
does have your back.

09:35.817 --> 09:37.518
Unless she's planning
on taking that car

09:37.606 --> 09:39.225
to the other side of the
chasm and leaving it there.

09:39.312 --> 09:41.137
Then you'd have no way
of getting across.

09:43.149 --> 09:44.648
Hmm.

10:06.264 --> 10:09.801
Um, did you want me to
get the door for you, too?

10:13.879 --> 10:16.942
Uh, that was pretty brave
what you did back there.

10:17.066 --> 10:20.518
I mean, I was gonna do it
before you volunteered, but...

10:20.606 --> 10:23.496
Thanks, Lance. All in the name
of fulfilling destiny.

10:23.613 --> 10:26.692
You really buy all
this destiny stuff?

10:26.872 --> 10:29.372
I believe everybody's
got a destiny.

10:31.332 --> 10:33.946
I told you Cass
wouldn't let us down.

10:34.164 --> 10:36.063
Okay, okay, I might
have read too much

10:36.151 --> 10:37.716
into that monkey's warning.

10:37.860 --> 10:40.819
It's just the thought of
anything hurting you...

10:47.673 --> 10:49.624
Look! Can we not go
just one place

10:49.712 --> 10:51.490
without some weirdo
jumping out of nowhere?

10:52.918 --> 10:55.656
Lance, Cass, you guys
keep cranking!

10:55.744 --> 10:57.919
Get us across this
as fast as possible.

10:58.007 --> 11:01.040
Eugene, let's go see what
our new friend wants.

11:06.969 --> 11:08.305
Eugene!

11:10.413 --> 11:12.068
Eugene, watch out!

11:23.587 --> 11:24.783
Ahh!

11:26.252 --> 11:27.566
Ugh!

11:42.906 --> 11:47.170
Guys, uh, I'm not trying
to rush you. Go faster!

11:48.507 --> 11:51.123
Come on, Rapunzel!

11:51.210 --> 11:52.625
Yah!

11:58.375 --> 11:59.731
Where did she come from?

11:59.819 --> 12:02.695
Like an angel,
she fell from heaven.

12:02.783 --> 12:06.104
And now Adira's here.
Because, why wouldn't she be?

12:39.925 --> 12:41.892
- Adira!
- No!

13:01.862 --> 13:04.763
Rapunzel, you
and the others go.

13:04.850 --> 13:06.799
- I'll hold off Mr. Personality.
- But...

13:06.886 --> 13:08.934
I said, go! Now!

13:11.733 --> 13:13.667
Cassandra! Wait!

13:13.834 --> 13:18.250
All right, what do you say
we call this one a draw?

13:27.309 --> 13:28.875
Eugene!

13:31.477 --> 13:32.810
No!

13:34.480 --> 13:36.547
No!

13:47.180 --> 13:49.516
Oh, that was
thoroughly unpleasant.

13:53.269 --> 13:55.466
Oh, thank heavens.
You're okay.

13:56.827 --> 13:58.576
Well, what are you
waiting for?

13:58.894 --> 14:02.405
I... I won't fight you.

14:04.462 --> 14:07.928
You are my son.

14:12.504 --> 14:14.069
Father?

14:14.666 --> 14:16.632
You're my father?

14:24.330 --> 14:27.900
Well, of course!
Of course, you are!

14:28.300 --> 14:29.674
I don't know why I didn't
see it before.

14:29.761 --> 14:32.183
I mean, the dark,
soulless eyes,

14:32.271 --> 14:33.930
the unbridled aggression
that drives one

14:34.018 --> 14:36.037
to attack total strangers!

14:45.882 --> 14:48.542
I am your father.

14:57.658 --> 15:00.833
I'm... I'm so sorry, Raps.

15:01.063 --> 15:03.781
This is not how
our story ends.

15:03.924 --> 15:05.219
We're going back
to get him.

15:05.307 --> 15:06.878
No need. He's fine.

15:06.966 --> 15:09.588
He made it safely into
the cave below. I saw it.

15:09.675 --> 15:11.757
Now, come. Fish Skin
didn't risk his life

15:11.844 --> 15:13.625
so that we could waste
time looking for him.

15:13.752 --> 15:15.904
Just a minute, Adira.

15:15.992 --> 15:18.183
You knew that
knight back there.

15:18.271 --> 15:21.086
In fact, I'd bet you know a lot
of things you're not telling us.

15:21.245 --> 15:23.001
We're not going another step

15:23.088 --> 15:25.859
until you start
giving us answers!

15:25.947 --> 15:27.592
You're right, Princess.

15:27.709 --> 15:30.124
It's time you heard
the whole story.

15:30.362 --> 15:33.512
Don't worry. It's
actually quite an interesting story.

15:33.599 --> 15:35.948
And it starts with the Moon.

15:36.035 --> 15:38.707
Once upon a time,
a single drop of moonlight

15:38.826 --> 15:40.352
fell from the heavens.

15:40.472 --> 15:42.955
<i>And from this small
drop of moonlight,</i>

15:43.109 --> 15:46.758
<i>formed a single,
seductive opal stone.</i>

15:47.001 --> 15:49.234
<i>It had the ability
to destroy</i>

15:49.361 --> 15:53.802
<i>any and all who would
seek to possess it.</i>

15:53.953 --> 15:55.701
<i>Centuries passed,</i>

15:55.852 --> 15:58.370
<i>this opal's
defenses spread,</i>

15:58.457 --> 16:01.651
<i>and from that
grew a kingdom.</i>

16:01.739 --> 16:04.273
A kingdom founded
by our ancestors.

16:04.414 --> 16:06.886
Generation after generation
of our bloodline

16:06.974 --> 16:08.547
have stood guard here,

16:08.650 --> 16:12.639
helping to protect the world
from the opal's limitless power.

16:12.860 --> 16:15.251
<i>But it was Edmund,
the last of the Dark Kings,</i>

16:15.356 --> 16:18.161
<i>who tried to end this legacy
and destroy the stone.</i>

16:19.211 --> 16:21.362
<i>That didn't go so well.</i>

16:23.782 --> 16:26.669
<i>In the fallout,
I commanded my subjects</i>

16:26.757 --> 16:28.986
<i>to leave and never return.</i>

16:31.457 --> 16:34.291
<i>Even my own son.</i>

16:36.295 --> 16:39.144
I sent my most trusted
soldiers into the world

16:39.232 --> 16:41.747
<i>to ensure this power
be kept a secret.</i>

16:41.909 --> 16:44.483
<i>For if it ever fell
into the wrong hands,</i>

16:44.570 --> 16:46.572
<i>it would mean certain doom.</i>

16:46.839 --> 16:48.520
<i>These knights called
themselves...</i>

16:48.678 --> 16:51.975
<i>The Brotherhood, which
I always thought was a bit odd,</i>

16:52.086 --> 16:55.060
<i>because, well, one of us
is a woman.</i>

16:55.328 --> 16:57.729
<i>I refused to believe such
darkness could exist</i>

16:57.816 --> 17:00.933
<i>without a light of equal power
somewhere in this world.</i>

17:01.020 --> 17:03.101
<i>As usual, I was right.</i>

17:03.240 --> 17:06.497
<i>After years of searching,
I found the Sun-drop.</i>

17:06.692 --> 17:11.376
Only you, Rapunzel, can
restore balance to all things.

17:11.463 --> 17:13.554
If you've known
this all along,

17:13.642 --> 17:16.214
why have you
been so cryptic?

17:16.396 --> 17:18.916
While I'm certain bringing the
Sun-drop to the MoonStone

17:19.003 --> 17:20.752
will neutralize its threat,

17:21.005 --> 17:23.230
I'm not sure what
will happen to you.

17:23.387 --> 17:25.978
You mean if Rapunzel touches
the MoonStone, she could...

17:26.066 --> 17:28.927
I did not come this far
to stop now.

17:29.069 --> 17:31.580
Good. Are we all
friends again?

17:31.717 --> 17:34.010
- Sure.
- We never were.

17:36.665 --> 17:39.152
This is the only safe
way up. Follow me.

17:40.826 --> 17:43.875
Sorry, Max, it looks like you
two will have to stay here.

17:44.047 --> 17:47.312
Don't worry, m'lady!
I'm great with children.

17:47.399 --> 17:51.188
Ha, they're in good
hands, Shorty!

17:51.370 --> 17:52.815
You're in charge.

18:00.746 --> 18:02.661
And then there were four.

18:07.773 --> 18:09.254
Welcome home.

18:09.708 --> 18:11.662
Yeah, it's uh...

18:12.130 --> 18:13.632
Wow, you really
went all-in

18:13.720 --> 18:15.762
with the whole dark
theme, didn't ya?

18:15.895 --> 18:17.644
Oh, he likes it.

18:18.931 --> 18:21.600
So tell me this,
Old Brooding Armor Guy.

18:21.688 --> 18:23.230
What makes you think
we're related, anyway?

18:23.317 --> 18:25.617
It's your eyes.
I can tell a lot

18:25.704 --> 18:28.153
by looking into
a man's eyes.

18:28.355 --> 18:30.656
Also my ravens have
been following you

18:30.743 --> 18:32.524
ever since you left.

18:32.611 --> 18:34.750
These don't do your
nose any justice.

18:34.909 --> 18:36.958
That's what I've
been screaming!

18:37.046 --> 18:39.859
I think this reunion is
off to a great start!

18:39.947 --> 18:42.616
We're finding common ground,
exchanging stories.

18:42.755 --> 18:44.809
I just might win
him over yet!

18:44.952 --> 18:46.772
You know, I can hear
what you're saying.

18:46.859 --> 18:51.643
Oh, I'm sorry. I must be
speaking my thoughts out loud.

18:51.776 --> 18:54.179
I have been alone
a long time.

18:54.836 --> 18:56.014
How's this?

18:56.139 --> 18:58.483
You are unaware of what
I'm thinking now, yes?

18:58.640 --> 19:01.206
Yeah, no, you're saying
everything that you're thinking

19:01.294 --> 19:03.321
out loud, and I can
still hear all of it.

19:03.408 --> 19:06.736
Drat! I will work
on this skill.

19:09.400 --> 19:12.600
Over time, my
ravens lost track of you.

19:12.688 --> 19:15.547
Oy, you see what
I have to work with?

19:15.635 --> 19:18.671
Right. Look, I've got to
find my friends, you see.

19:18.791 --> 19:20.965
I need to make sure
Rapunzel is okay.

19:21.053 --> 19:23.909
So long as she stays away from
the MoonStone, she will be.

19:24.152 --> 19:26.311
But she can't;
she's the Sun-drop.

19:26.431 --> 19:28.547
You don't know
that she is, son.

19:28.634 --> 19:31.181
Whoa, whoa, whoa. You do
not get to call me son!

19:31.269 --> 19:33.963
All right, listen. I didn't
want to have to do this,

19:34.098 --> 19:35.687
but you leave me no choice.

19:35.863 --> 19:39.350
Here comes "The Glower."

19:39.511 --> 19:41.560
Wow, okay, yeah.
You can stop that.

19:41.647 --> 19:44.763
This is kind of
an off day for me.

19:44.850 --> 19:46.935
This doesn't usually happen.

19:47.545 --> 19:49.201
A quarter of a century ago,

19:49.288 --> 19:51.737
I had you taken as
far away as possible.

19:51.824 --> 19:54.372
Yet, after all that time
and all those miles,

19:54.506 --> 19:58.469
you wind up here
in front of me with this.

19:58.557 --> 20:00.923
A weapon that could
actually have the power

20:01.011 --> 20:02.464
to destroy the MoonStone!

20:05.336 --> 20:07.852
We shall destroy
the MoonStone together!

20:07.940 --> 20:09.454
We? No, listen.

20:09.598 --> 20:11.690
The black rocks made
a path for Rapunzel,

20:11.777 --> 20:13.030
leading her here...

20:13.118 --> 20:15.939
Leading you here to put
an end to the MoonStone.

20:16.027 --> 20:19.053
It can get into your head,
fill it with thoughts.

20:19.141 --> 20:20.992
That's what it's doing
to your friend.

20:21.080 --> 20:25.004
That's what it did to me, and I
nearly destroyed my own kingdom.

20:25.171 --> 20:30.152
I barely survived, but not
everyone was so fortunate.

20:30.240 --> 20:32.374
Your mother.

20:34.132 --> 20:37.749
Perhaps it isn't Rapunzel's
destiny to grab the MoonStone,

20:37.836 --> 20:40.819
but yours to save her
from doing so.

20:41.133 --> 20:45.242
Don't allow the same fate to
befall the love of your life.

20:50.082 --> 20:51.517
We're here.

20:51.605 --> 20:53.431
Be on your guard.

20:53.582 --> 20:57.872
This path is lined with lethal,
inescapable traps.

20:58.607 --> 21:00.501
Watch out!

21:02.506 --> 21:03.642
Great traps!

21:03.729 --> 21:06.762
Okay, so I oversold the traps
a little. They're old.

21:09.334 --> 21:10.600
Whoa!

21:14.831 --> 21:16.899
Uh, what was that?

21:17.007 --> 21:20.344
The MoonStone. It must know
the Sun-drop is close.

21:20.439 --> 21:22.282
Then we'd better get
on with this.

21:43.461 --> 21:44.653
Eugene!

21:44.942 --> 21:47.052
Oh! Thank goodness you're okay!

21:47.235 --> 21:48.992
I was so...

21:49.190 --> 21:51.159
Eugene? What is it?

21:51.326 --> 21:53.489
I'm sorry, Rapunzel.

21:54.947 --> 21:56.461
But I won't let you in.

22:01.746 --> 22:05.603
Eugene, let me in!

22:05.724 --> 22:07.630
Eugene!

22:22.641 --> 22:26.658
"One of her company
will turn against her."

22:27.434 --> 22:29.534
I can't believe this.

22:30.682 --> 22:32.931
Princess, listen to me.

22:33.101 --> 22:35.549
I've known Eugene
my entire life,

22:35.787 --> 22:38.090
and he has never,
and I mean never,

22:38.328 --> 22:42.357
loved anyone as much
as he loves you.

22:42.493 --> 22:44.747
Yeah, Raps. Whatever
he thinks he's doing,

22:44.835 --> 22:46.511
he must be doing it for you.

22:49.683 --> 22:51.453
You guys are probably right,

22:51.541 --> 22:53.885
but I need to hear it from him.

22:54.012 --> 22:56.658
We have to hurry.
The king has my Shadow Blade,

22:56.746 --> 22:58.690
which has the power
to cut these rocks.

22:59.113 --> 23:01.459
I know exactly what
he's going to do with it.

23:01.703 --> 23:03.762
Destroy the MoonStone.

23:03.991 --> 23:06.798
Pascal, find a way inside,
get to Eugene,

23:06.885 --> 23:10.283
and don't let him
anywhere near that stone.

23:12.625 --> 23:15.790
The rest of us need to look for
a back entrance or something.

23:15.878 --> 23:18.310
This can't be the only
way into the castle.

23:18.397 --> 23:21.023
I am afraid the King has sealed
all the entrances to the...

23:37.749 --> 23:40.732
If I know Rapunzel,
she's gonna find a way in here.

23:40.819 --> 23:43.370
Then we must get to
the MoonStone first!

24:09.181 --> 24:11.363
These statues,
are these my...

24:11.545 --> 24:13.356
They're our ancestors.

24:13.752 --> 24:16.177
Generation after generation
have sacrificed

24:16.265 --> 24:18.303
to keep this stone
from the world.

24:18.390 --> 24:21.443
And now, you're here
to help me destroy it

24:21.531 --> 24:24.804
once and for all, and take
your place among them.

24:32.107 --> 24:36.650
There it is, son.
The MoonStone.

24:41.752 --> 24:45.135
No longer shall its burden
fall upon us,

24:46.418 --> 24:52.270
for all that stands between us
and our destiny is this bridge.

25:00.398 --> 25:02.866
I'll go get a rope.

I think we'll be okay.

28:40.620 --> 28:44.027
Great! A sewer full of lava.

28:46.324 --> 28:49.592
Well, good news: this will
lead us into the castle.

28:56.134 --> 28:58.512
Lava sewer it is, then.

29:07.846 --> 29:11.963
You heard the Princess.
I'm in charge.

29:12.097 --> 29:15.147
I think you'll find me
tough but fair.

29:46.084 --> 29:48.618
Well great, I'm shrinking.

29:50.522 --> 29:53.022
Oh, look, I can see
my house from here.

29:56.761 --> 29:58.109
How much further?

29:58.196 --> 29:59.935
Another couple hundred
yards and we'll be

30:00.023 --> 30:01.659
directly below
the throne room.

30:15.613 --> 30:17.395
We'd better get to
that MoonStone soon.

30:17.482 --> 30:19.731
I don't know how much longer
we can survive down here.

30:19.818 --> 30:21.733
I'm gonna go with
not much longer.

30:21.820 --> 30:24.367
We must turn back
and find another way.

30:26.257 --> 30:27.824
Ooh!

30:32.564 --> 30:34.408
- We're trapped!
- No!

30:34.496 --> 30:35.943
No, we're not trapped.

30:36.085 --> 30:37.873
The rocks are
working with us.

30:37.961 --> 30:40.526
They're pushing us
toward the MoonStone.

30:55.222 --> 30:58.443
Huh! I'd say that's
a pretty good theory.

31:18.807 --> 31:20.273
Pascal?

31:21.288 --> 31:23.152
What are you doing here?

31:23.815 --> 31:25.630
Are you okay, frog?

31:26.061 --> 31:28.182
Yeah, yeah, I know...
I know you're mad at me,

31:28.270 --> 31:30.056
but I didn't
have a choice.

31:31.427 --> 31:33.971
Look, this is gonna sound
crazy, but this place

31:34.364 --> 31:36.661
is where I come from.

31:38.338 --> 31:40.547
I know we brought Rapunzel
here to grab the stone,

31:40.635 --> 31:43.985
but everything...
Everything is different now.

31:44.502 --> 31:48.394
Look, the last time someone
tried to destroy the MoonStone,

31:48.482 --> 31:49.754
I lost my mother.

31:52.432 --> 31:55.402
I mean, what if we lost
Rapunzel, Pascal?

32:03.365 --> 32:06.515
<i>"One of her company
will turn against her."</i>

32:06.692 --> 32:08.098
It's me!

32:08.927 --> 32:11.570
I'm the one who turned
against Rapunzel.

32:13.016 --> 32:14.764
I should've known better.

32:18.404 --> 32:19.817
All right, Pascal.

32:19.905 --> 32:21.733
Let's go find Rapunzel.

32:29.011 --> 32:33.030
Hey guys! I think
I see a light ahead.

32:33.117 --> 32:37.225
At long last, 
my son has returned.

32:37.313 --> 32:41.578
Yes, he has come
to answer his birthright.

32:41.753 --> 32:43.953
What? What do you see?

32:44.041 --> 32:45.216
Is it Eugene?

32:45.304 --> 32:46.865
I think creepy guy's
talking to himself.

32:46.965 --> 32:49.952
This is good. It means he
doesn't suspect we're here.

32:50.063 --> 32:52.850
He has come to
embrace his destiny

32:53.083 --> 32:55.038
just as we all have.

32:55.202 --> 32:58.095
The MoonStone chamber is
just through those doors.

32:58.183 --> 33:01.592
Okay, I'll need a distraction
before I can slip in there.

33:01.726 --> 33:03.828
No way. You're not
going in alone.

33:03.915 --> 33:04.968
Who knows
what's in there?

33:05.056 --> 33:06.530
Rapunzel should go in alone.

33:06.618 --> 33:10.250
Only the Sun-drop can access
the MoonStone's great power.

33:14.353 --> 33:16.861
Since when did you stop
trusting my judgement?

33:18.245 --> 33:19.713
Cass and I will go.

33:19.811 --> 33:22.231
Adira, you're with Lance.

33:24.824 --> 33:26.805
You two run interference
against the king

33:26.893 --> 33:29.051
so we can slip by.

33:33.778 --> 33:35.726
Okay, on my count.

33:35.964 --> 33:37.895
One, two...

33:40.785 --> 33:43.420
My next throw will
find its target.

33:43.508 --> 33:45.121
You were warned
to stay away.

33:45.209 --> 33:47.838
- Edmund...
- I have nothing to say to you, Adira!

34:09.851 --> 34:11.951
Your majesty, please.

34:13.685 --> 34:16.434
The MoonStone knows
I'm close. I have to go.

34:16.521 --> 34:17.920
No!

34:18.956 --> 34:20.471
No one may enter that room.

34:20.558 --> 34:23.908
I'm going in, and you don't
want to get in my way!

34:23.995 --> 34:25.494
You're not
getting past me.

34:25.581 --> 34:28.034
Yes, she is!

34:28.123 --> 34:31.110
Let her in!
She's the Sun-drop!

34:31.197 --> 34:33.866
- Eugene!
- Rapunzel, I am so sorry!

34:33.954 --> 34:35.804
- I just thought...
- There's no time for that.

34:35.891 --> 34:37.288
We have to get
to that stone!

34:37.375 --> 34:39.507
This place is coming
down around us!

34:39.650 --> 34:42.748
But the MoonStone must
be destroyed, son!

34:43.003 --> 34:44.562
- Son?
- Son?

34:44.649 --> 34:46.101
You finally got adopted!

34:46.188 --> 34:48.466
- Look, I'll fill you all in later.
- Oh!

34:48.590 --> 34:51.496
I'm a prince.
Probably.

35:02.423 --> 35:03.604
What's goin' on?

35:03.835 --> 35:05.650
It can't be...

35:05.869 --> 35:06.949
What is it?

35:07.037 --> 35:10.047
For centuries,
my ancestors have sworn

35:10.135 --> 35:12.360
to protect this threshold.

35:12.744 --> 35:16.533
And now, their spirits have
arisen to uphold that oath.

35:18.449 --> 35:22.199
Not necessarily how
I imagined meeting your family.

35:37.068 --> 35:39.034
Adira, catch me!

35:41.917 --> 35:44.119
Love hurts.

35:44.978 --> 35:47.407
So, you have a dad?

35:47.495 --> 35:48.893
Yeah, turns out you
weren't the only one

35:48.980 --> 35:50.828
who had a destiny
waiting here.

36:09.734 --> 36:12.264
No! She mustn't be let in!

36:12.352 --> 36:14.251
Listen, Your Majesty...
Father... I...

36:14.338 --> 36:15.575
I don't know what to call you,

36:15.663 --> 36:17.091
but you have to
stop these spirits!

36:17.179 --> 36:18.707
Even if I could,

36:18.938 --> 36:21.114
she must never
enter that room!

36:41.612 --> 36:43.594
Watch out!

36:43.886 --> 36:46.135
- Are you okay?
- I had it under control!

36:47.171 --> 36:49.497
Lance, thank you.

37:00.818 --> 37:02.898
They keep coming back!

37:02.986 --> 37:05.892
Then we got here just in time!

37:06.057 --> 37:07.872
You know, maybe
you're right.

37:07.959 --> 37:10.771
Maybe me coming back here
is fulfilling my destiny.

37:10.859 --> 37:14.053
But what if my destiny is not
to join you in this place,

37:14.141 --> 37:17.302
but rather it is
to rescue you from it!

37:17.492 --> 37:19.249
You don't have
to fight anymore.

37:19.337 --> 37:22.244
She's come to put an end
to all of this. Trust me.

37:22.332 --> 37:25.008
How... how can you be sure?

37:25.199 --> 37:27.992
You said you can tell a lot by
looking into somebody's eyes, right?

37:28.258 --> 37:29.827
Well, look into mine,

37:29.997 --> 37:32.270
because I have faith
in Rapunzel.

37:33.579 --> 37:34.993
And you should, too.

37:39.625 --> 37:41.573
Couldn't get through
those ghosts, huh?

37:41.661 --> 37:44.648
Believe it or not, they are
surprisingly stubborn.

37:44.736 --> 37:45.966
Go figure.

37:52.751 --> 37:54.095
Aw.

38:00.901 --> 38:04.294
Lance, don't give up.

38:04.484 --> 38:07.631
Okay, Lance, buddy. I think
we learned something today:

38:07.718 --> 38:09.633
everyone has a destiny.

38:09.720 --> 38:12.670
We have no idea what that fate
is, but we do know one thing:

38:12.858 --> 38:16.012
we are not gonna
meet it today!

38:29.140 --> 38:30.621
Lance, you're a genius!

38:30.708 --> 38:32.970
And that's the first and last
time, I'll ever say that!

38:33.058 --> 38:35.492
Guys! Cover for Lance!

38:45.988 --> 38:47.687
Max! Heads up!

39:05.409 --> 39:07.376
Going down.

39:23.675 --> 39:26.971
Our family is just awful.

39:51.514 --> 39:53.555
It's all up
to you now.

39:53.795 --> 39:56.781
No, it's up to us.

40:17.648 --> 40:19.148
We made it, guys.

41:34.258 --> 41:39.524
Look, I know these last few
months haven't been easy for us.

41:39.913 --> 41:43.797
I wanna thank you
for everything.

41:45.769 --> 41:48.698
Okay, Rapunzel. It's time.

41:53.031 --> 41:57.239
This is it, Rapunzel.
Now go get your destiny.

41:57.461 --> 41:59.164
I love you.

42:18.602 --> 42:21.385
Cassandra?
What are you doing?

42:21.472 --> 42:24.239
I'm fulfilling my destiny!

43:02.548 --> 43:05.203
I tried to warn you, Rapunzel.

43:06.483 --> 43:10.454
You have to be
careful who you trust.
