WEBVTT

00:06.006 --> 00:08.142
Man:
PREVIOUSLY ON
"IN TREATMENT"...

00:08.242 --> 00:09.843
HOW DOES THIS WORK?
HE DOESN'T GET
TO INTERPRET

00:09.943 --> 00:11.379
EVERYTHING I SAY
IN HERE, DOES HE?

00:11.479 --> 00:13.214
IT'S THE SAME HERE
AS WHEN PAUL'S AT HOME.

00:13.314 --> 00:15.083
HE'S NOT
A PSYCHOTHERAPIST HERE.

00:15.183 --> 00:18.052
HE'S NOT A THERAPIST
AT HOME? OKAY.

00:20.454 --> 00:22.656
DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT IT
FEELS LIKE TO BE WANTED?

00:25.426 --> 00:27.728
WHAT-- WHAT IS IT?
DID I S--

00:29.163 --> 00:32.466
DO-- DO YOU KNOW
WHAT TRANSFERENCE IS?

00:32.566 --> 00:35.336
WHEN A PATIENT HAS
FEELINGS FOR THEIR THERAPIST

00:35.436 --> 00:38.506
WHICH ARE DRAWN
FROM THEIR RELATIONSHIP
WITH THEIR PARENTS?

00:38.606 --> 00:40.040
DID YOU FUCK HER?

00:41.442 --> 00:44.145
EDWARD, HE WAS NOTHING.
CAN YOU SAY IT'S NOTHING?

00:44.245 --> 00:45.746
CAN YOU SAY IT'S
NOTHING WITH THIS--

00:45.846 --> 00:47.915
WITH-- WHAT--
WHAT'S HER NAME?
WHAT IS HER NAME?

00:48.015 --> 00:49.250
I CAN'T TELL YOU,
I'M NOT ALLOWED TO.

00:49.350 --> 00:51.552
I WANT TO KNOW
AND YOU'D BETTER
TELL ME, PAUL.

00:51.652 --> 00:54.222
- I AM NOT FUCKING AROUND.
- LAURA.

00:57.691 --> 00:59.327
( knocking )

01:05.866 --> 01:07.101
- HI, KATE.
- GINA.

01:07.201 --> 01:09.137
- HI, HOW ARE YOU?
- OKAY.

01:09.237 --> 01:11.305
- I MADE US SOME TEA.
- HI.

01:11.405 --> 01:13.141
HI.

01:16.877 --> 01:18.212
GIVE ME YOUR CELL.

01:18.312 --> 01:20.248
LEAVE--
LEAVE THE RINGER ON.

01:20.348 --> 01:22.683
THAT'S KIND OF
THE POINT.

01:24.252 --> 01:26.053
WE'VE BEEN WAITING
FOR ROSIE TO CHECK IN ALL DAY.

01:26.154 --> 01:28.222
SHE SLEPT OVER
AT A FRIEND'S HOUSE AND...

01:28.322 --> 01:30.224
SHE HASN'T CHECKED IN YET.

01:30.324 --> 01:32.826
Kate:
WELL, AT LEAST
THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID.

01:32.926 --> 01:34.328
BUT YOU KNOW,
LORD KNOWS

01:34.428 --> 01:36.764
IT'S NOT THE FIRST TIME
IN HISTORY THAT A TEENAGER

01:36.864 --> 01:39.767
SAID SHE WAS GONNA STAY
AT A FRIEND'S AND THEN
SHE ENDED UP SOMEWHERE ELSE.

01:39.867 --> 01:41.402
SO WHERE IS SHE?

01:41.502 --> 01:45.105
( laughs )
DO YOU THINK I'M
WITHHOLDING INFORMATION?

01:45.206 --> 01:46.707
ARE YOU?

01:52.079 --> 01:54.315
( theme music playing )

02:10.631 --> 02:12.800
ANYWAY, UM...

02:12.900 --> 02:15.068
SARAH'S PARENTS
ARE AWAY AND--

02:15.169 --> 02:16.704
AND ROSIE'S NOT
ANSWERING HER PHONE,

02:16.804 --> 02:18.539
SO IT'S
A LITTLE CONVENIENT.

02:18.639 --> 02:20.641
DIDN'T THIS HAPPEN
A FEW WEEKS AGO?

02:20.741 --> 02:23.677
MM-HMM, BUT THIS TIME
SHE'S BEEN GONE FOR 24 HOURS.

02:25.279 --> 02:27.181
I MEAN, SHE IS
AT THAT AGE, ISN'T SHE?

02:27.281 --> 02:29.650
- THAT MAKES IT OKAY?
- NO, I DIDN'T SAY THAT.

02:29.750 --> 02:31.619
HER MOTHER DOESN'T
TRUST HER WHEN SHE SAYS
SHE'S SPENDING

02:31.719 --> 02:33.987
THE NIGHT WITH A FRIEND,
THAT'S THE CAUSE FOR CONCERN.

02:34.087 --> 02:37.024
I'M PRETTY CONCERNED.

02:37.124 --> 02:39.760
HENCE, THE TWO
PHONES LAID OUT.

02:40.961 --> 02:42.396
WHEN DID YOU LAST
TALK TO HER?

02:42.496 --> 02:44.298
Kate:
YESTERDAY,
WHEN I WAS AT WORK.

02:44.398 --> 02:46.133
I DON'T KNOW
IF PAUL TOLD YOU,

02:46.234 --> 02:47.601
BUT I RUN A SHELTER
FOR BATTERED WOMEN

02:47.701 --> 02:50.338
AND IT'S ALSO A CENTER
FOR YOUTHS AT RISK.

02:50.438 --> 02:52.573
AND ROSIE VOLUNTEERS THERE
ABOUT FOUR TIMES A WEEK.

02:52.673 --> 02:55.243
SHE TOLD ME SHE'D
BE THERE AND THEN SHE
WAS GOING TO SARAH'S,

02:55.343 --> 02:58.812
BUT SHE DID SAY IT
IN HER RESPONSIBLE VOICE,
WHICH SHOULD'VE TIPPED ME OFF.

03:00.314 --> 03:04.117
ANYWAY, SARAH'S PARENTS
ARE IN MEXICO AND--

03:04.218 --> 03:06.654
I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE
THE GIRLS DROVE OFF
SOMEWHERE AFTER SCHOOL.

03:06.754 --> 03:07.955
SARAH'S GOT A CAR.

03:08.055 --> 03:09.990
AND, YOU KNOW, ROSIE WAS
PROBABLY AFRAID TO TELL US

03:10.090 --> 03:11.992
BECAUSE YOU MIGHT
FLIP OUT AND--

03:12.092 --> 03:15.429
- I'D FLIP OUT?
- WELL--

03:15.529 --> 03:17.631
WHO KNOWS?
I DON'T KNOW.

03:20.568 --> 03:23.337
WHAT KIND OF WORK DOES
ROSIE DO AT THE CENTER?

03:24.472 --> 03:26.006
WHATEVER'S NEEDED,

03:26.106 --> 03:28.041
BASICALLY,
FROM WRITING UP SCHEDULES

03:28.141 --> 03:29.410
TO RUNNING ERRANDS.

03:29.510 --> 03:30.978
SHE SITS IN
ON INTERVIEWS SOMETIMES

03:31.078 --> 03:34.147
JUST SO SHE CAN GET A SENSE
OF HOW WE EVALUATE PEOPLE,

03:34.248 --> 03:35.949
HOW MUCH TROUBLE
THEY MAY BE IN

03:36.049 --> 03:37.318
AND HOW MUCH HELP
THEY MAY NEED.

03:37.418 --> 03:40.421
FOUR TIMES A WEEK--

03:40.521 --> 03:43.123
IT'S A COMMITMENT FOR
A 16-YEAR-OLD KID.

03:43.223 --> 03:44.825
17-YEAR-OLD NEXT MONTH.

03:44.925 --> 03:47.295
IT'S INTERESTING,
BECAUSE WHEN ROSIE'S
VOLUNTEERING,

03:47.395 --> 03:51.031
- ALL OF A SUDDEN
SHE'S AN ADULT.
- SHE'S A BORN SOCIAL WORKER.

03:51.131 --> 03:53.567
ALWAYS HAS BEEN,
EVER SINCE SHE WAS A KID.

03:56.304 --> 03:58.005
HOW DID SHE SHOW THAT
WHEN SHE WAS YOUNGER?

03:58.105 --> 04:01.375
WELL, SHE WAS ALWAYS
THE MEDIATOR WITH HER
FRIENDS ON THE PLAYGROUND.

04:01.475 --> 04:03.210
YOU KNOW, ORGANIZING,
MAKING THE PEACE,

04:03.311 --> 04:04.645
THAT KIND OF THING.

04:04.745 --> 04:06.880
EVEN HER TEACHERS
REMARKED ON IT.

04:06.980 --> 04:08.716
AND YOU HEARD THIS WHERE?

04:08.816 --> 04:11.585
I DON'T-- I DON'T REALLY
RECALL YOU AT TOO MANY
PARENT-TEACHER CONFERENCES--

04:11.685 --> 04:13.787
I WAS ON THE PTA BOARD
AT ARLINGTON, REMEMBER?

04:13.887 --> 04:16.790
WELL, PAUL,
I MEAN, COME ON,
YOU WENT TWICE.

04:19.092 --> 04:23.764
DID YOU EVER SEE ROSIE TAKE ON
THIS MEDIATOR ROLE AT HOME?

04:26.800 --> 04:27.968
W-- WHAT SHE MEANS IS

04:28.068 --> 04:30.704
WAS ROSIE
OUR SOCIAL WORKER?

04:30.804 --> 04:32.640
SEE, GINA CAN'T CONCEIVE
OF A CHILD BEING BORN

04:32.740 --> 04:35.443
WITH AN INTRINSIC DESIRE
TO HELP OTHER PEOPLE

04:35.543 --> 04:37.411
WITHOUT IT BEING
A COPING MECHANISM

04:37.511 --> 04:39.647
FOR-- FOR SOMETHING ELSE.

04:40.180 --> 04:41.482
RIGHT?

04:47.721 --> 04:50.223
ROSIE'S ALWAYS
BEEN INTERESTED
IN BEING OF SERVICE,

04:50.324 --> 04:53.160
AND THAT'S SOMETHING
WE ENCOURAGED.

04:53.260 --> 04:55.563
- DID WE?
- I ENCOURAGED IT.

04:55.663 --> 04:59.533
I THINK IT'S GREAT.
I THINK IT'S INCREDIBLE
THAT SHE-- THAT SHE VOLUNTEERS.

05:05.038 --> 05:07.741
I-- I TALK TO HER
ABOUT EVERYTHING SHE
SEES DOWN AT THE CENTER,

05:07.841 --> 05:10.043
AND IT'S CERTAINLY
NOT HER RESPONSIBILITY

05:10.143 --> 05:13.847
TO DEAL WITH ANY
OF THE HARDCORE CASES
OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

05:13.947 --> 05:15.916
I MAKE SURE THAT SHE'S
NOT IN OVER HER HEAD.

05:16.016 --> 05:19.653
I-- I TELL HER WHO'S WHO
AND WHAT'S GOING ON AND...

05:21.855 --> 05:23.323
( sighs )

05:27.160 --> 05:30.531
YEAH, I DO, I AGREE WITH YOU.
I THINK FOUR TIMES A WEEK
IS A LITTLE TOO MUCH.

05:30.631 --> 05:33.066
YOU KNOW, THERE MIGHT BE
A LITTLE MORE TO IT

05:33.166 --> 05:35.536
FOR ROSIE
THAN A DESIRE TO HELP.

05:36.837 --> 05:39.072
WHAT GINA IS SAYING
IS THAT ROSIE MIGHT BE

05:39.172 --> 05:41.208
WORKING AROUND AT-RISK YOUTHS

05:41.308 --> 05:44.211
BECAUSE SHE'S
DISTRESSED HERSELF.

05:44.311 --> 05:48.081
PAUL, DO YOU REALLY THINK
KATE AND I NEED
AN INTERPRETER?

05:49.683 --> 05:51.519
SORRY.

05:51.619 --> 05:53.454
WHEN DID SHE START
VOLUNTEERING?

05:53.554 --> 05:55.623
UH, IT WAS-- WHAT?

05:55.723 --> 05:57.858
--ABOUT SIX--
SIX MONTHS AGO.

05:57.958 --> 06:00.794
AND I WAS THRILLED
AT FIRST BECAUSE IT
MEANT SHE WAS SPENDING

06:00.894 --> 06:04.565
LESS TIME AT THE MALL
WITH HER FRIENDS, BUT...

06:04.665 --> 06:06.266
I DON'T KNOW, I'M THINKING
SHE MAY NEED MORE OF THAT.

06:06.366 --> 06:08.235
WHAT, MORE TIME
AT THE MALL?

06:08.335 --> 06:12.272
NO, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.
JUST DOING STUPID
TEENAGER STUFF.

06:12.372 --> 06:14.241
I MEAN, WHY SHOULD
SHE BE SO CONCERNED

06:14.341 --> 06:16.544
WITH THE WORLD'S
PROBLEMS AT HER AGE?

06:16.644 --> 06:18.178
I DON'T THINK THAT'S
WHAT GINA'S SAYING.

06:18.278 --> 06:20.080
- PAUL.
- SHE'S SAYING THAT ROSIE

06:20.180 --> 06:21.482
IS DRAWN TO THE PLACE

06:21.582 --> 06:23.216
BECAUSE SHE'S TRYING
TO SAY SOMETHING TO US,

06:23.316 --> 06:26.454
- BUT THAT WE'RE OBLIVIOUS--
- CAN I SPEAK FOR MYSELF?

06:26.554 --> 06:28.388
ISN'T THAT WHAT
YOU'RE TRYING TO GET AT?

06:28.489 --> 06:30.891
IT'S NOT FOR YOU TO SAY
WHAT I'M GETTING AT.

06:33.894 --> 06:35.463
SORRY.

06:35.563 --> 06:37.831
YOU KNOW, EVEN IF
ROSIE HAS A DESIRE

06:37.931 --> 06:41.168
OR A VOCATION
TO HELP OTHER PEOPLE,

06:41.268 --> 06:43.403
I'M WONDERING:
HOW MUCH OF THAT

06:43.504 --> 06:45.439
DO YOU THINK
A 17-YEAR-OLD KID NEEDS?

06:45.539 --> 06:48.609
16. SHE'S STILL 16.

06:48.709 --> 06:50.210
16.

06:50.310 --> 06:51.745
SO, YES, PAUL,
SHE MAY BE TRYING

06:51.845 --> 06:53.781
TO SHINE A LIGHT
ON SOMETHING.

06:56.717 --> 06:59.119
OKAY, THAT'S IT.
I'M GONNA TRY HER AGAIN,

06:59.219 --> 07:03.491
SINCE APPARENTLY
HER VOLUNTEERING
IS A CRY FOR HELP.

07:10.531 --> 07:12.866
OH, THANK GOD.
IT'S RINGING.

07:13.867 --> 07:15.503
ROSIE.

07:15.603 --> 07:17.671
I'M GONNA KILL YOU.
WHERE THE HELL HAVE YOU--

07:17.771 --> 07:20.541
- NO, BECAUSE WE HAVE--
- LET ME TALK TO HER.

07:22.375 --> 07:25.846
- KATE.
- SINCE WHEN DOES
THAT HAPPEN?

07:25.946 --> 07:28.048
- KATE, LET ME
TALK TO HER, PLEASE.
- NO, WHEN-- WHEN--

07:28.148 --> 07:30.718
WHEN YOU SLEEP AWAY,
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO CALL
FIRST THING IN THE MORNING.

07:30.818 --> 07:32.486
- THAT WAS
THE AGREEMENT...
- KATE.

07:32.586 --> 07:34.454
...AND YOU KNOW IT.

07:34.555 --> 07:37.024
NO, WE WILL
DISCUSS THIS AT HOME.

07:37.124 --> 07:39.760
NO, BECAUSE WE'RE OUT.
WE'RE TALKING TO SOMEONE.

07:41.495 --> 07:43.897
AN-- AN ACCOUNTANT.

07:43.997 --> 07:46.099
NO, YOU DON'T
KNOW HIM-- HER.

07:47.835 --> 07:49.603
WELL, HE'S SITTING--
NO, HE'S SITTING RIGHT HERE,

07:49.703 --> 07:52.105
AND HE IS LOOKING
NONE TOO PLEASED
ABOUT ANY OF THIS.

07:54.542 --> 07:57.044
WE'LL TALK
AT HOME, ROSIE.

07:58.846 --> 08:00.380
ALL RIGHT.

08:00.480 --> 08:01.915
SO I'M NOT ALLOWED
TO SPEAK TO HER?

08:02.015 --> 08:04.217
SHE CLAIMED SHE GOT
TO SARAH'S LATE LAST NIGHT,

08:04.317 --> 08:06.587
THEN THEY WERE BOTH LATE
FOR SCHOOL THIS MORNING
AND-- GET THIS--

08:06.687 --> 08:08.956
SHE DIDN'T REALIZE
HER PHONE WAS OFF,

08:09.056 --> 08:11.525
WHICH IS A LITTLE
LIKE ME NOT REALIZING
MY HEAD'S ON FIRE, BUT--

08:11.625 --> 08:13.961
SHE IS NOT
STAYING THERE AGAIN.

08:14.061 --> 08:16.630
( groans )
OKAY, WELL,
YOU TELL HER THAT.

08:18.732 --> 08:20.968
IF I WERE GINA,
I'D ASK, "WHY NOW?"

08:21.068 --> 08:24.504
- Kate: "WHY NOW" WHAT?
- WELL, IF A COUPLE CAME
TO ME WITH THIS PROBLEM,

08:24.605 --> 08:27.340
I'D SAY "WHY IS SHE
CHOOSING TO ACT OUT NOW?"

08:27.440 --> 08:30.243
THAT'S WHAT YOU'D ASK?
REALLY?

08:30.343 --> 08:32.445
WELL, MAYBE YOU SHOULD
CALL THAT COUPLE

08:32.546 --> 08:34.047
AND ASK THEM AND THEN
YOU CAN GET BACK TO ME.

08:34.147 --> 08:36.383
SHE'S DOING THIS ON PURPOSE.
IT'S OBVIOUS.

08:36.483 --> 08:39.486
SHE SENSES A CONFLICT
BETWEEN US AND SHE'S
TURNING IT AROUND,

08:39.587 --> 08:42.089
SO THAT SHE'S GIVEN US
A TASTE OF WHAT IT'S LIKE
TO WORRY ABOUT HER.

08:42.189 --> 08:45.392
SHE'S A TEENAGER.
THERE'S NOT SOME MASTER
PLAN INVOLVED HERE.

08:45.492 --> 08:47.260
THIS IS JUST HOW
TEENAGE GIRLS ARE, RIGHT?

08:47.360 --> 08:48.896
I MEAN, IT'S JUST
HOW THEY THINK

08:48.996 --> 08:50.631
OR DON'T THINK,
IN THIS CASE.

08:50.731 --> 08:52.966
Gina:
NO, KATE,
IT'S NOT CONSCIOUS,

08:53.066 --> 08:54.835
BUT IT'S WORKING.

08:54.935 --> 08:58.772
ROSIE VANISHES AND YOU BECOME
FUNCTIONING PARENTS.

08:58.872 --> 09:02.175
YOU'RE UNITED
IN YOUR CONCERN FOR HER.

09:07.748 --> 09:11.852
DO YOU THINK
THAT ROSIE SENSES
THE CONFLICT BETWEEN YOU?

09:15.222 --> 09:16.724
UH...

09:16.824 --> 09:20.227
I-- I THINK WE'VE BEEN
PRETTY GOOD ABOUT PRETENDING.

09:20.327 --> 09:21.829
WE'VE ACTUALLY GOTTEN
PRETTY SKILLED AT THAT.

09:21.929 --> 09:25.332
SO, WHY NOW?
AS PAUL ASKED,

09:25.432 --> 09:28.101
WHY NOW?
DID SOMETHING HAPPEN?

09:28.201 --> 09:31.672
YOU KNOW, WHAT--
WHAT DO YOU THINK
SHE'S REACTING TO?

09:31.772 --> 09:34.041
WELL, I'D SAY IT'S
MORE TENSE ACTUALLY.

09:34.141 --> 09:36.543
- Gina: MORE TENSE?
- MM-HMM, KATE--

09:36.644 --> 09:39.512
- KATE RAN INTO LAURA.
- I DIDN'T RUN INTO HER,

09:39.613 --> 09:41.782
I SAW HER AS SHE
WAS LEAVING THE HOUSE.

09:41.882 --> 09:43.851
- THE HOUSE?
- Paul: MY OFFICE.

09:43.951 --> 09:46.620
HIS OFFICE, THE HOUSE,
MY HOME, WHATEVER.

09:46.720 --> 09:47.955
IT'S ALL A LITTLE
BLURRED, ISN'T IT?

09:48.055 --> 09:49.790
I THOUGHT YOU SAID
SHE STOPPED THERAPY?

09:49.890 --> 09:51.358
YES, HE DID SAY THAT,
DIDN'T HE?

09:51.458 --> 09:53.060
ACTUALLY, HER FATHER
WAS HOSPITALIZED

09:53.160 --> 09:54.594
AND SHE ASKED ME
IF SHE COULD COME BY.

09:54.695 --> 09:56.396
SHE WAS PRETTY UPSET.

09:56.496 --> 09:58.398
PLEASE-- PLEASE
DON'T DO THAT.

09:58.498 --> 10:02.369
- WHAT?
- DESCRIBING HER LIKE SHE'S
THIS FRAGILE LITTLE THING,

10:02.469 --> 10:04.337
LIKE SHE'S SOME
POOR LOST SOUL.

10:04.437 --> 10:06.273
SHE'S NOT.

10:06.373 --> 10:08.175
I SAW HER.

10:09.843 --> 10:11.812
HOW DID SHE SEEM TO YOU?

10:14.447 --> 10:15.883
SHE'S TAMMY KENT.

10:15.983 --> 10:17.384
WHAT?

10:17.484 --> 10:19.319
WHO'S TAMMY KENT?

10:19.419 --> 10:23.123
- HOW IS SHE TAMMY KENT?
- YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT.

10:28.862 --> 10:30.563
MAY I ASK
WHO THIS IS?

10:30.664 --> 10:33.133
THIS WAS A GIRL THAT
PAUL WAS IN LOVE WITH
WHEN WE FIRST MET.

10:33.233 --> 10:34.802
A LONG LONG TIME AGO.

10:34.902 --> 10:37.004
WELL, WHATEVER.
THEY'RE EXACTLY
THE SAME TYPE...

10:37.104 --> 10:39.006
- NO, THEY'RE NOT.
- ...AND HE-- YES, THEY ARE--

10:39.106 --> 10:41.775
AND HE MADE LAURA OUT TO BE
THIS FRAGILE LITTLE GIRL,

10:41.875 --> 10:44.377
AND I AM TELLING YOU,
WHAT I SAW WAS

10:44.477 --> 10:46.379
THIS HIGHLY-SEXUAL WOMAN

10:46.479 --> 10:48.315
WHO WAS WEARING STILETTOS
AT 10:00 IN THE MORNING.

10:48.415 --> 10:50.483
- TAMMY KENT.
- I DID NOT DESCRIBE
HER LIKE THAT.

10:50.583 --> 10:54.254
- IF YOU FORMED AN IMAGE--
- NO-- BUT YOU LET ME THINK

10:54.354 --> 10:56.790
THAT SHE WAS ONE OF YOUR
FATHERLESS WALKING WOUNDED.

10:56.890 --> 10:58.926
NO, YOU RUSHED TO THAT
CONCLUSION YOURSELF.

10:59.026 --> 11:02.362
OH, AND WHAT HE ALSO
FORGOT TO MENTION IS THAT
SHE'S STUNNINGLY BEAUTIFUL.

11:02.462 --> 11:04.932
AND VERY YOUNG,
BUT THAT'S NO SURPRISE, IS IT?

11:05.032 --> 11:08.435
JESUS CHRIST,
IT'S THE GODDAMN
HISTORY OF THE WORLD,

11:08.535 --> 11:10.237
LEAVING YOUR
MIDDLE-AGED WIFE AND--

11:10.337 --> 11:11.772
OH, GOD.

11:11.872 --> 11:13.741
ISN'T IT A LITTLE
EMBARRASSING FOR YOU

11:13.841 --> 11:16.643
THAT YOU'VE TURNED OUT
TO BE LIKE EVERY THIRD MAN?

11:16.744 --> 11:19.412
I MEAN, YOU'VE SPENT
YOUR ENTIRE LIFE STUDYING
THE HUMAN CONDITION

11:19.512 --> 11:23.216
AND NOW YOU'RE JUST
FOLLOWING YOUR DICK AROUND
LIKE A CAVEMAN.

11:31.258 --> 11:34.127
THIS WOMAN, LAURA,
SHE'S GOT THIS, UM...

11:36.429 --> 11:38.498
THIS SPOILED, ALOOF

11:38.598 --> 11:41.201
AND CALCULATED LOOK.

11:41.301 --> 11:44.437
AND-AND-AND--
AND SHE HAS THIS, UH...

11:46.473 --> 11:48.508
THIS AIR
OF SELF-CONFIDENCE

11:48.608 --> 11:51.178
THAT IS QUITE
OBVIOUSLY BULLSHIT,

11:51.278 --> 11:53.280
BECAUSE IF ANYTHING REAL
EVER HAPPENED TO HER,

11:53.380 --> 11:56.449
SHE WOULDN'T KNOW
WHAT THE HELL TO DO.
SHE WAS SO FAKE.

11:56.549 --> 11:59.119
AND ALL THIS YOU SAW WHILE YOU
WERE TAKING OUT THE TRASH.

11:59.219 --> 12:02.055
YES, THAT'S RIGHT,
JUST BY LOOKING AT HER.

12:02.155 --> 12:06.093
EVERYTHING IS COMMUNICATED
WHETHER WE LIKE IT OR NOT--
ANOTHER ONE OF YOUR LINES.

12:06.193 --> 12:08.728
AND YOU JUST HAPPENED TO BE--
TO BE THERE AS SHE WAS--

12:08.829 --> 12:10.630
OH, DON'T KEEP
DOING THAT.

12:10.730 --> 12:14.634
YOU'RE MAKING ME OUT
TO LOOK LIKE I'M SOME
LOOSE-CANNON, DEMENTED WIFE.

12:14.734 --> 12:16.469
WELL, IF SHE IS ALL THAT--
SPOILED AND A FAKE--

12:16.569 --> 12:17.838
WHY ARE YOU
SO THREATENED BY HER?

12:17.938 --> 12:20.240
BECAUSE MY HUSBAND
IS IN LOVE WITH HER.

12:29.149 --> 12:32.219
AND BECAUSE SHE'S
THE KIND OF WOMAN
WHO ALWAYS GETS HER MAN.

12:42.395 --> 12:44.965
A WOMAN LIKE THAT HAS
ALWAYS BEEN HIS FANTASY--

12:45.065 --> 12:47.935
GORGEOUS,
SELF-CENTERED,
UNATTAINABLE.

12:48.035 --> 12:51.304
THAT'S WHAT I WANT?
IT'S-- IT'S GOOD
TO KNOW THAT.

12:54.274 --> 12:56.443
YOU DON'T SEE
YOURSELF THAT WAY?

12:57.811 --> 12:59.312
NO.

13:01.248 --> 13:03.516
SO, YOU'RE NOT
PAUL'S FANTASY?

13:04.918 --> 13:06.820
NO, I'M NOT.

13:06.920 --> 13:08.555
YET HE MARRIED YOU.

13:13.493 --> 13:17.497
WELL, I GUESS HE GOT
A RAW DEAL, DIDN'T HE?

13:18.932 --> 13:20.200
HE WANTED
THE TROPHY WIFE

13:20.300 --> 13:22.535
AND HE GOT STUCK
WITH A HOMEMAKER.

13:22.635 --> 13:25.939
I'M JUST A GOOD MOM.

13:26.039 --> 13:28.241
- PRETTY BORING.
- COME ON, KATE,
LISTEN TO YOURSELF.

13:28.341 --> 13:30.677
YOU'RE COMPLETELY
INVALIDATING YOUR--

13:30.777 --> 13:32.812
YOUR SEXUALITY
FOR A START.

13:32.913 --> 13:35.949
I THINK WE BOTH KNOW
THAT YOU COULD'VE DONE
BETTER IF YOU'D WANTED TO.

13:36.049 --> 13:39.352
KATE, I FELL IN LOVE WITH YOU,
NOT JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE--
YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL AND SEXY,

13:39.452 --> 13:43.523
BUT BECAUSE--
BECAUSE OF YOUR STRENGTH.

13:45.625 --> 13:48.228
- HER STRENGTH?
- YES.

13:48.328 --> 13:52.199
SHE WAS-- SHE WAS GROUNDED
AND HONEST AND--

13:52.299 --> 13:54.935
AND DEPENDABLE.

13:55.035 --> 13:58.872
I-- I NEEDED THAT.
I THINK WE BOTH NEEDED THAT.

14:04.777 --> 14:07.280
NOT ANYMORE.
I DON'T NEED YOU ANYMORE.

14:28.035 --> 14:29.636
( clears throat )

14:29.736 --> 14:32.372
WELL, I NEED YOU.
I'VE ALWAYS LOVED YOU,
WANTED YOU AND NEEDED YOU.

14:32.472 --> 14:35.142
BUT NOT LIKE LAURA.
YOU NEVER EVER WANTED
ME LIKE THAT.

14:35.242 --> 14:37.544
HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT?

14:37.644 --> 14:41.414
YOU KEEP JUMPING
TO THESE CONCLUSIONS
THAT MAKE NO...

14:53.293 --> 14:57.630
KATE, YOU SAID
YOU DIDN'T NEED
PAUL ANYMORE.

14:57.730 --> 14:59.666
CAN YOU TALK
ABOUT THAT A LITTLE?

15:05.472 --> 15:07.440
I DON'T NEED HIM
LIKE I USED TO...

15:09.776 --> 15:11.444
NOT LIKE I THOUGHT
I NEEDED HIM.

15:13.780 --> 15:17.050
I DON'T KNOW,
MAYBE I DON'T EVEN NEED
A PARTNER AT ALL.

15:19.486 --> 15:22.322
I MEAN, WOULD I LIKE ONE?
YEAH, OF COURSE.

15:24.424 --> 15:26.326
BUT IT WOULD BE
AWFULLY NICE

15:26.426 --> 15:29.262
IF THAT PERSON WERE
A BIT MORE PRESENT
AND AVAILABLE.

15:29.362 --> 15:32.165
( sniffs )
BUT DO I NEED IT?

15:32.265 --> 15:34.567
IF THAT'S
THE QUESTION, UM...

15:37.237 --> 15:40.407
NO, I THINK
I'VE-- I'VE LEARNED
TO LIVE WITHOUT IT.

15:45.078 --> 15:47.680
WHAT KIND OF PARTNER
COULD YOU SEE YOURSELF WITH?

15:47.780 --> 15:49.782
( laughs )

15:49.882 --> 15:52.085
OH, I DON'T KNOW.
I-- UM--

15:53.420 --> 15:55.288
I MEAN, YOU KNOW,
MY FRAME OF REFERENCE

15:55.388 --> 15:58.391
FOR TWO AND A HALF DECADES
HAS BEEN PAUL, SO...

16:01.328 --> 16:03.130
OUR FRIENDS,
THEIR HUSBANDS,

16:03.230 --> 16:06.833
WHAT THE HELL
DO I KNOW ABOUT WHAT
THEY'RE REALLY LIKE?

16:06.933 --> 16:08.301
WHAT GOES ON BEHIND
CLOSED DOORS?

16:08.401 --> 16:11.671
I MEAN, DO WE KNOW...
ANY COUPLE, REALLY?

16:14.507 --> 16:16.809
IT'S-- IT'S NOT LIKE I SIT
AROUND DAYDREAMING ABOUT IT

16:16.909 --> 16:20.080
OR I HAVE SOME
FANTASTIC FLIGHT OF FANCY

16:20.180 --> 16:22.349
ABOUT SOME
PERFECT MAN OR, UM...

16:24.084 --> 16:25.852
( laughs )
I COULD BE WITH
A SERIAL KILLER

16:25.952 --> 16:28.188
AS LONG AS HE TOLD ME
ABOUT HIS DAMN DAY.

16:35.128 --> 16:36.463
AND IT'S NOT JUST
ABOUT BEING WANTED.

16:36.563 --> 16:39.132
I KNOW-- I KNOW THAT'S
WHAT I SAID LAST WEEK.

16:43.570 --> 16:45.072
AND WANTED IS GOOD.
I MEAN, OF COURSE,

16:45.172 --> 16:47.174
EVERYBODY WANTS
THAT, BUT...

16:51.344 --> 16:52.479
YES?

16:52.579 --> 16:55.182
I JUST WANT TO BE
A PART OF SOMETHING.

16:56.983 --> 16:59.219
IT DOESN'T
HAVE TO BE BIG...

16:59.319 --> 17:01.421
( crying )
AND IT DOESN'T
HAVE TO BE GRAND.

17:08.861 --> 17:12.732
BUT I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING
ABOUT WOMEN LIKE LAURA.

17:12.832 --> 17:14.267
IT...

17:16.636 --> 17:19.739
THEY'RE-- THEY'RE JUST
ALL ABOUT SEX. YOU KNOW,
THAT'S THEIR CURRENCY.

17:19.839 --> 17:23.243
THAT'S-- IT'S-- IT'S
NOT THE ACTUAL SEX ITSELF,
THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M SAYING.

17:23.343 --> 17:26.846
IT'S-- SEX AS THIS THING
THAT CONTROLS,

17:26.946 --> 17:30.217
THAT-- THAT DETERMINES
THE DISTANCE BETWEEN HER
AND SOMEONE ELSE,

17:30.317 --> 17:32.352
AND I CANNOT
COMPETE WITH THAT.

17:40.927 --> 17:42.429
KATE...

17:44.030 --> 17:48.368
LAURA ISN'T
A SEXUAL OBJECT FOR PAUL.

17:48.468 --> 17:51.104
THEIR RELATIONSHIP
ISN'T BASED ON THAT.

17:51.204 --> 17:54.907
IT'S MORE... CHASTE.

17:55.007 --> 17:58.745
SHE'S NOT HIS SEXUAL FANTASY.
IT'S NOT ABOUT LUST.

18:03.883 --> 18:06.286
THE REAL THREAT IS...

18:06.386 --> 18:09.622
THAT HE MAY ACTUALLY HAVE
FALLEN IN LOVE WITH HER.

18:14.194 --> 18:16.496
YOU KNOW, YOU SAID
YOU WERE DRAWN TO HIM.

18:16.596 --> 18:19.566
YOU MARRIED HIM
BECAUSE YOU ADMIRED HIM...

18:19.666 --> 18:22.769
BECAUSE HE PAID SUCH
DEEP ATTENTION TO YOU.

18:22.869 --> 18:24.471
YOU WERE GRATEFUL

18:24.571 --> 18:27.374
THAT YOU FELT
YOU WERE INTERESTING.

18:28.475 --> 18:31.278
THAT DYNAMIC
OF PATIENT-THERAPIST

18:31.378 --> 18:34.714
WAS SATISFYING TO BOTH
OF YOU AT THAT POINT--

18:34.814 --> 18:37.484
- JESUS CHRIST, GINA.
- PLEASE LET ME DO
MY JOB HERE, PAUL.

18:37.584 --> 18:39.652
Paul:
YOUR JOB OF WHAT,
RUSHING TO CONCLUSIONS?

18:43.256 --> 18:45.091
EVENTUALLY, KATE,
YOU FELT

18:45.192 --> 18:48.060
THAT IT WASN'T
SATISFYING FOR YOU.

18:48.161 --> 18:51.464
YOU-- YOU'VE OUTGROWN
THAT DEPENDENCY.

18:51.564 --> 18:54.501
YOU'VE OUTGROWN
THAT PART OF YOUR MARRIAGE.

18:54.601 --> 18:57.437
YOU SAID YOU DON'T
NEED PAUL ANYMORE,

18:57.537 --> 19:00.173
YOU DON'T NEED
TO BE TAKEN CARE OF

19:00.273 --> 19:04.211
AND PAUL MAY HAVE
SENSED THIS.

19:04.311 --> 19:06.913
YOU'RE DRIFTING AWAY
FROM UNDER HIS WING,

19:07.013 --> 19:09.115
AND SUDDENLY
HE FINDS HIMSELF

19:09.216 --> 19:11.884
CONFUSED ABOUT HIS FEELINGS
FOR A PATIENT.

19:13.286 --> 19:15.655
LAURA IS
DEPENDENT ON PAUL.

19:18.791 --> 19:23.330
HE'S HER THERAPIST,
HER ELDER, HER GUIDE.

19:23.430 --> 19:26.098
DEPENDENCY DEFINES
THAT RELATIONSHIP.

19:26.199 --> 19:29.135
OH, I SEE,
SO SHE'S NOT MY--
MY GROUPIE ANYMORE,

19:29.236 --> 19:31.103
SO I FOUND SOMEBODY TO--

19:31.204 --> 19:32.372
TO REPLACE HER.
IS THAT YOUR THEORY?

19:32.472 --> 19:35.808
NICE ONE, GINA. HMM.

19:35.908 --> 19:37.910
SEE, YOUR PROBLEM IS
YOU THINK IT'S IMPOSSIBLE

19:38.010 --> 19:40.480
TO FALL IN LOVE
WITH A PATIENT
WITHOUT SOME KIND OF...

19:40.580 --> 19:43.583
PATHOLOGY SURROUNDING
THE WHOLE THING.

19:47.186 --> 19:51.224
KATE, YOU'RE TRYING
TO REDEFINE YOURSELF
IN YOUR MARRIAGE,

19:51.324 --> 19:53.726
TO SEE YOURSELF
NOT AS A DEPENDANT

19:53.826 --> 19:56.162
BUT AS AN EQUAL.

19:56.263 --> 19:58.030
DO YOU THINK YOU CAN DO
THAT AND STAY WITH PAUL?

19:58.130 --> 19:59.966
Paul:
GINA, FOR FUCK'S SAKE.

20:00.066 --> 20:03.370
IF I'M THIS
NARCISSISTIC MONSTER

20:03.470 --> 20:06.072
THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT
WHO HAS TO BE ADMIRED

20:06.172 --> 20:09.075
AND-- AND-- AND
WORSHIPPED AND NEEDED,

20:09.175 --> 20:11.010
HOW DOES THAT FIT
WITH ME SITTING HERE

20:11.110 --> 20:13.413
TRYING TO ADDRESS
THE PROBLEM THAT
WE'VE BROUGHT TO YOU?

20:13.513 --> 20:15.948
I'M NOT SAYING
YOU'RE A MONSTER, PAUL.

20:16.048 --> 20:18.251
IN FACT,
IF YOU'LL LISTEN,

20:18.351 --> 20:20.920
I'M NOT EVEN SAYING
IT'S ALL YOU.

20:23.690 --> 20:26.659
KATE, PAUL MAY NOT
SEE YOU AS AN EQUAL,

20:26.759 --> 20:30.129
BUT PERHAPS YOU'VE
CONTRIBUTED TO THAT.

20:30.229 --> 20:31.898
MAYBE IT'S HOW YOU

20:31.998 --> 20:33.333
WANTED TO BE SEEN.

20:33.433 --> 20:36.836
IT'S WHAT WAS
COMFORTABLE FOR YOU.

20:36.936 --> 20:41.341
YEAH, 25 YEARS, I ALWAYS
FELT HE COULD WALK OUT
AT ANY MINUTE. YEP.

20:41.441 --> 20:43.310
WAS THAT PART
OF THE ATTRACTION?

20:43.410 --> 20:46.313
Paul:
WOULD YOU STOP IT?
WOULD YOU STOP

20:46.413 --> 20:50.216
PUTTING THESE POISONOUS
FUCKING WORDS INTO HER MOUTH?

20:50.317 --> 20:51.918
YOU'VE IGNORED ME
IN THIS CONVERSATION.

20:52.018 --> 20:53.586
YOU SEE
WHAT SHE'S DOING.

20:53.686 --> 20:55.788
SHE'S INSTRUCTING YOU
ON WHAT YOU SHOULD BE FEELING.

20:55.888 --> 20:57.390
IT'S FUCKING RECKLESS.

20:57.490 --> 20:59.158
WHY ARE YOU SPEEDING
THIS UP, GINA?

20:59.258 --> 21:01.994
DO YOU WANT TO MEDDLE,
IS THAT IT? TO SEE HOW
FAST YOU CAN DO THIS?

21:02.094 --> 21:05.665
PUSHING KATE TO
A PLACE THAT USUALLY
TAKES MONTHS IF NOT YEARS?

21:05.765 --> 21:08.134
- Gina: THAT'S NOT
WHAT I'M DOING.
- WHAT TAKES MONTHS?

21:08.234 --> 21:11.137
WHAT SHE'S SAYING
IS THAT YOU HAVE
A PREDISPOSITION

21:11.237 --> 21:13.139
TO BE REJECTED,
TO NOT BE MY EQUAL,

21:13.239 --> 21:15.775
THAT YOU'RE REACTING
TO YOUR CHILDHOOD.

21:15.875 --> 21:18.911
THAT IS-- THAT IS RUSHING
THE PROCESS, GINA.

21:20.246 --> 21:21.614
HERE'S THE WAY
I THINK IT WORKS:

21:21.714 --> 21:23.616
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO FOCUS
ON THE COUPLE FIRST,

21:23.716 --> 21:25.718
THEN TALK TO THEM
ABOUT THEIR PARENTS
AND THEIR CHILDHOOD.

21:25.818 --> 21:27.720
IF YOU DO IT THE OTHER WAY,
THEY BLAME EACH OTHER.

21:27.820 --> 21:29.922
THEY SAY "OH, I KNEW IT.
YOUR MOTHER FUCKED YOU UP

21:30.022 --> 21:33.259
AND NOW YOU'RE TAKING IT
OUT ON ME." DO SEE YOU SEE
HOW DESTRUCTIVE THAT IS?

21:33.360 --> 21:35.628
MAYBE YOU DON'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT CHILDHOODS

21:35.728 --> 21:38.230
BECAUSE WE'D END UP TALKING
ABOUT YOUR CHILDHOOD.

21:38.331 --> 21:40.032
OH, SO WE'RE BACK
TO WHERE WE STARTED.

21:40.132 --> 21:42.569
YOU SAW ME AFTER 10 YEARS
AND RIGHT AWAY YOU DECIDED
THAT I'M MY FATHER.

21:42.669 --> 21:44.971
AND LIKE HIM,
I'M IN LOVE WITH MY PATIENT

21:45.071 --> 21:47.607
AND THAT I'M PUSHING KATE
TOWARDS HAVING AN AFFAIR

21:47.707 --> 21:50.109
SO THAT I CAN HAVE
AN EXCUSE TO LEAVE THE HOUSE.

21:50.209 --> 21:52.379
AND NOW, OF COURSE, KATE--
AN HOUR AND A HALF WITH HER

21:52.479 --> 21:54.447
AND EVERYTHING FITS PERFECTLY.

21:54.547 --> 21:55.782
GAME, SET AND MATCH
TO YOU, GINA.

21:55.882 --> 21:57.950
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I CAN'T REALLY
DO THIS ANYMORE.

21:58.050 --> 22:00.387
I'M VERY SORRY.
I KNOW THIS WAS
MY IDEA, BUT...

22:00.487 --> 22:02.589
I KNEW, DEEP DOWN,
THAT IF I CAME HERE

22:02.689 --> 22:04.524
IT WOULD TURN
INTO THIS HISTORY
BETWEEN YOU TWO.

22:04.624 --> 22:06.759
AND I'M SORRY,
IT'S JUST-- IT'S REALLY
NOT HELPFUL TO ME.

22:06.859 --> 22:09.762
- I APOLOGIZE--
- I'M SORRY, KATE.
I'M SORRY.

22:11.030 --> 22:15.001
( door opens, closes )

22:26.613 --> 22:28.881
I'LL SEE YOU
NEXT WEEK, OKAY?

22:28.981 --> 22:30.683
GOOD NIGHT.

22:48.267 --> 22:51.538
( theme music playing )
