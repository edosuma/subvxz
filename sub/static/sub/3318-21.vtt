00:00.001 --> 00:03.635
<i>Previously on</i> reign...
You killed someone in the woods

00:03.637 --> 00:07.373
<i>When the pagans forced you</i>
<i>to choose a sacrifice.</i>

00:07.375 --> 00:09.274
I murdered a man who was about
to kill another.

00:09.276 --> 00:11.310
And to this day I wonder:
Did he have a family?

00:11.312 --> 00:13.012
I have very powerful uncles.

00:13.014 --> 00:14.346
What, the duke of guise?

00:14.348 --> 00:15.547
Do you have any idea
what you've done?

00:15.549 --> 00:17.449
You just let the devil
into our home.

00:19.552 --> 00:22.354
Francis:
<i>It's father.</i>
<i>He's gone utterly mad.</i>

00:22.356 --> 00:24.189
You think I'm delusional?

00:24.191 --> 00:26.458
French forces marched for calais
this morning.

00:26.460 --> 00:28.494
I need the duke's army
to save France.

00:28.496 --> 00:30.696
We stay and finish this
or we die trying.

00:30.698 --> 00:32.364
Fire!

00:38.605 --> 00:40.773
(crowd cheering)

00:54.554 --> 00:56.455
Mary:
Did you see francis yet?

00:56.457 --> 00:57.756
Not yet.

00:57.758 --> 00:59.525
It's strange how,
after months of waiting,

00:59.527 --> 01:01.794
These last moments
are the most agonizing.

01:01.796 --> 01:03.829
What about you?
Don't you want
to look for leith?

01:03.831 --> 01:06.065
He was conscripted so he
wouldn't be punished here.

01:06.067 --> 01:08.300
If he survived,
he would never return.

01:08.302 --> 01:10.202
It's better that he doesn't.

01:10.204 --> 01:12.438
Why isn't bash here
to greet his brother?

01:12.440 --> 01:16.708
He's out in the blood wood again
hunting for the darkness.

01:16.710 --> 01:21.380
(sighs) why bash feels
it's his duty to end this,
I don't know.

01:21.382 --> 01:23.782
I just want him
to come home to me.

01:23.784 --> 01:27.386
Take me away from court
and our mad king.

01:27.388 --> 01:30.089
Man:
God save prince francis!

01:30.091 --> 01:32.157
200 years!

01:32.159 --> 01:34.827
For 200 years
the english have occupied

01:34.829 --> 01:37.463
Our port city of calais,
but no longer!

01:37.465 --> 01:40.232
(crowd cheers)

01:40.234 --> 01:42.634
Calais is ours once again!

01:42.636 --> 01:44.670
(cheering)

01:44.672 --> 01:47.639
And I am proud to say that
I fought alongside

01:47.641 --> 01:50.642
The bravest soldiers in europe,

01:50.644 --> 01:53.212
And the duke of guise, whose men

01:53.214 --> 01:56.281
And bravery helped us
achieve victory!

01:56.283 --> 01:57.816
(cheering)

02:01.387 --> 02:03.288
Mention your father, francis.

02:03.290 --> 02:05.724
Don't let that son of a bitch
do it first.

02:05.726 --> 02:08.560
In truth, the real
hero of calais

02:08.562 --> 02:10.562
Is the man with the vision...

02:10.564 --> 02:15.734
Of a France free and whole!

02:15.736 --> 02:19.638
The man who masterminded
this victory!

02:20.573 --> 02:23.542
King henry valois!

02:23.544 --> 02:25.611
(crowd cheering)

02:25.613 --> 02:29.214
We have our work cut out
for us with that one.

02:29.216 --> 02:30.482
Get to it.

02:30.484 --> 02:32.351
Man:
King henry!

02:32.353 --> 02:33.752
Mary.

02:33.754 --> 02:35.654
Francis...

02:35.656 --> 02:39.491
You came back to me.
You came back.

02:39.493 --> 02:44.563
Not only did we reclaim calais,
but I have news of my own:

02:44.565 --> 02:46.365
My spies in England
have been tracking

02:46.367 --> 02:49.468
The queen's slow crawl
to the grave.

02:49.470 --> 02:52.237
After countless rumors
and endless waiting,

02:52.239 --> 02:54.540
She is dead!

02:54.542 --> 02:58.210
The queen of England,
mary tudor, is dead!

02:58.212 --> 02:59.545
(crowd cheering)

03:01.581 --> 03:03.582
The tudor queen betrayed
the catholic church,

03:03.584 --> 03:07.553
Her own faith, by naming
a protestant to the throne.

03:07.555 --> 03:12.591
But god's will reigns.

03:12.593 --> 03:17.696
We will take the time
to relish our victories,

03:17.698 --> 03:20.732
Knowing that one day
England will be ours,

03:20.734 --> 03:24.736
Crushed and then reborn
under its rightful queen,

03:24.738 --> 03:27.272
Mary stuart!

03:27.274 --> 03:29.508

05:02.368 --> 05:03.669
I overheard
the servants complaining

05:03.671 --> 05:06.638
When I brought in the logs.

05:06.640 --> 05:08.674
I don't think they've come
across many noblemen

05:08.676 --> 05:11.710
Who enjoy cutting
their own firewood.

05:11.712 --> 05:13.779
I find it charming.

05:18.051 --> 05:19.651
And this home?

05:19.653 --> 05:22.821
Our home?
Do you find it charming as well?

05:22.823 --> 05:24.589
It's lovely.

05:24.591 --> 05:27.359
I'm thrilled it was available
on such short notice.

05:27.361 --> 05:29.628
But I would ultimately
like to find something

05:29.630 --> 05:31.496
Further from court.

05:31.498 --> 05:36.001
Not hungary; I know you've tired
of the weather in your homeland.

05:36.003 --> 05:37.569
I crave a warmer climate.

05:37.571 --> 05:39.338
But-but you...

05:39.340 --> 05:41.973
Why are you so eager to put
distance between you and court?

05:41.975 --> 05:45.977
Is there someone there
you hope to avoid?

05:45.979 --> 05:48.547
Lola, you can tell me the truth.

05:48.549 --> 05:50.349
Are you worried
about a resemblance?

05:50.351 --> 05:54.886
Your hair is so dark and lovely.

05:54.888 --> 05:56.655
So is yours.

05:56.657 --> 06:01.093
The child will likely
be fairer than either of us.

06:01.095 --> 06:03.662
Ah. Well, uh,

06:03.664 --> 06:05.797
Many dark-haired people
have fair-haired children.

06:05.799 --> 06:08.533
No one will know
the child isn't mine.

06:08.535 --> 06:10.068
Because I will be

06:10.070 --> 06:12.471
The happiest and proudest father
and husband

06:12.473 --> 06:14.539
Anyone has ever seen.

06:21.013 --> 06:22.814
Mary...
Not yet.

06:22.816 --> 06:25.617
If we could lie here
a little longer.

06:25.619 --> 06:27.853
Just a few more moments

06:27.855 --> 06:29.855
With nothing else
to think about

06:29.857 --> 06:31.523
Except each other.

06:31.525 --> 06:33.058
I know you have
grave reservations.

06:35.395 --> 06:39.398
But today you are faced with the
news that mary tudor has died.

06:39.400 --> 06:41.867
The world will be looking
to you for your response.

06:41.869 --> 06:44.870
And if I shall stake my claim
to England.

06:44.872 --> 06:46.805
Elizabeth
will be looking.

06:46.807 --> 06:50.509
She knows that she's most
vulnerable to your claim now

06:50.511 --> 06:51.943
Before her coronation,

06:51.945 --> 06:53.979
Before she consolidates
her power.

06:53.981 --> 06:55.847
It's a brief window
of opportunity

06:55.849 --> 06:58.417
That my father seems keen

06:58.419 --> 06:59.684
To take advantage of.

06:59.686 --> 07:02.587
If I stake my claim,
there will be war.

07:02.589 --> 07:05.957
I will be declaring myself
my cousin's enemy for life.

07:05.959 --> 07:08.026
I just want it all
to go away.

07:08.028 --> 07:09.761
I don't want to think
about England,

07:09.763 --> 07:11.430
Or my cousin,
or my half brother

07:11.432 --> 07:14.065
And his lords
who now control scotland.

07:14.067 --> 07:17.803
I've just got you back.

07:17.805 --> 07:20.539
I want us to have a chance
to love each other.

07:25.111 --> 07:29.214
You told me once that you would
support whatever decision

07:29.216 --> 07:31.049
I made in regards to England.

07:31.051 --> 07:33.518
Is that still true?

07:33.520 --> 07:36.621
I will stand by you.

07:36.623 --> 07:39.157
You can count on me,
as I count on you.

07:40.793 --> 07:43.161
I'm thinking of writing
my cousin a letter.

07:48.468 --> 07:51.536
Bash:
Did you find anything?

07:51.538 --> 07:54.873
More sacrifices
50 paces back.

07:54.875 --> 07:57.542
They've been dead
for a few days.

07:58.511 --> 08:00.946
My lord,
it grows darker.

08:11.023 --> 08:14.793
It's an eclipse.
Don't be afraid.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.534
It's blood.

08:22.536 --> 08:25.270
Fresh blood.

08:25.272 --> 08:26.938
Another sacrifice
to the darkness?

08:39.919 --> 08:41.620
Don't touch him.

08:41.622 --> 08:43.889
That boy came out
of the shadows.

08:43.891 --> 08:45.023
He's cold as ice.

08:56.002 --> 08:57.969
It's all right!
It's all right!
It's all right!

08:57.971 --> 09:00.205
I'm not going
to hurt you!
It's all right!

09:00.207 --> 09:02.641
You're safe now.
My name is sebastian

09:02.643 --> 09:05.243
And I want to help you.
What's your name?

09:07.880 --> 09:11.650
This whistle,
I know what it means,

09:11.652 --> 09:14.019
And it strikes fear
in my heart, too.

09:14.021 --> 09:16.288
Where did you get it?

09:16.290 --> 09:17.656
Have you seen him?

09:17.658 --> 09:19.024
Have you seen
the darkness?

09:19.026 --> 09:21.860
Don't bring him back with us,
my lord.

09:21.862 --> 09:23.328
That child will take us
all to hell.

09:23.330 --> 09:25.230
No, he won't.

09:25.232 --> 09:28.233
He'll take us to the darkness.

09:36.008 --> 09:38.009
(clears throat)

09:38.011 --> 09:39.744
Welcome.

09:39.746 --> 09:40.779
I got your message.
You said you wanted

09:40.781 --> 09:41.913
To discuss business?

09:41.915 --> 09:43.848
Gabrielle,
if you don't mind.

09:47.920 --> 09:49.921
Shall I return later?

09:49.923 --> 09:51.289
Not tonight, beauty.

09:56.762 --> 10:00.632
You on the other hand...

10:00.634 --> 10:05.036
Why don't you come back here
when you finish your chores?

10:06.172 --> 10:08.039
An interesting choice.

10:08.041 --> 10:10.709
Assuming you let her know
she has one

10:10.711 --> 10:12.310
Since she's a servant
and you're a duke.

10:12.312 --> 10:14.079
I'll let her know.

10:14.081 --> 10:16.181
I liked her.

10:16.183 --> 10:20.118
And she's certainly a step up
from one of catherine's spies.

10:20.120 --> 10:22.754
I wanted to discuss this letter
you wrote

10:22.756 --> 10:24.623
To elizabeth of England.

10:24.625 --> 10:28.226
At least three people read
every letter you send,

10:28.228 --> 10:30.061
Even the ones delivered
through private messengers.

10:30.063 --> 10:31.763
You think I don't know that?

10:31.765 --> 10:33.231
And why do you question my word?

10:33.233 --> 10:34.733
Your letter states

10:34.735 --> 10:37.035
That you want peace with
your cousin and her country.

10:37.037 --> 10:38.269
And for that, you're willing to

10:38.271 --> 10:40.105
Relinquish your claim
on England forever.

10:40.107 --> 10:42.374
A thought suited
for another world.

10:42.376 --> 10:44.075
But we live in this one.

10:44.077 --> 10:46.878
If I stake my claim,

10:46.880 --> 10:49.781
Thousands of people will die
to try and make it good.

10:49.783 --> 10:50.982
Either elizabeth or I
will lose our heads.

10:50.984 --> 10:52.050
And for what?!

10:52.052 --> 10:53.251
I'm already queen of scotland.

10:53.253 --> 10:54.986
I'm going to be queen of France.

10:54.988 --> 10:56.988
Isn't that enough?
So you're willing to disarm,

10:56.990 --> 10:58.657
Hoping your opponent
will disarm?

10:58.659 --> 10:59.891
Here's what you should know:

10:59.893 --> 11:02.260
When you disarm,
your opponent shoots you.

11:02.262 --> 11:04.362
We're not at war.

11:04.364 --> 11:06.031
Royals are always at war.

11:06.033 --> 11:07.198
Why?

11:07.200 --> 11:09.367
Why must I join in this madness?

11:09.369 --> 11:12.704
I can be a good wife to francis
and a good queen to his country.

11:12.706 --> 11:15.206
You can never have a normal life

11:15.208 --> 11:17.809
Because of who you are,
and without power

11:17.811 --> 11:19.711
You're nothing
but a threat.

11:19.713 --> 11:24.215
Mary. The truth is, you're still
simply a guest at french court.

11:24.217 --> 11:26.985
The wife of the dauphin.

11:26.987 --> 11:29.921
You must beg the king and queen
for anything scotland may need.

11:29.923 --> 11:33.358
All your power comes from what
you might do in the future.

11:33.360 --> 11:36.728
This is your only card.

11:36.730 --> 11:38.329
Once you play it...

11:38.331 --> 11:41.399
It's gone.

11:41.401 --> 11:42.834
(footsteps rapidly approaching)

11:42.836 --> 11:43.968
Kenna:
Bash. There you are.

11:43.970 --> 11:45.270
Why are you...?

11:45.272 --> 11:47.272
Who's this?

11:47.274 --> 11:49.407
We found him in the woods,
alone and covered in blood.

11:49.409 --> 11:53.845
He won't say a word about
what happened to him.

11:53.847 --> 11:55.380
The blood isn't his.

11:55.382 --> 11:57.282
He has no cuts, no bite marks,

11:57.284 --> 12:00.919
Nothing to match the other
victims of the darkness.

12:00.921 --> 12:03.054
What makes you think
the child encountered him?

12:03.056 --> 12:04.489
He was carrying this;

12:04.491 --> 12:06.224
It's a kind of
pagan whistle.

12:06.226 --> 12:07.358
I've heard it twice
before, and both times

12:07.360 --> 12:09.160
The darkness was nearby.

12:09.162 --> 12:12.997
I think he uses it
as a warning to inspire fear.

12:12.999 --> 12:14.332
Well, if it belongs
to the darkness,

12:14.334 --> 12:16.134
How did this child
get a hold of it?

12:17.903 --> 12:18.937
You must have got close to him.

12:18.939 --> 12:20.205
Was your family chosen?

12:20.207 --> 12:21.840
Were they sacrificed?

12:21.842 --> 12:22.941
Can you tell us where you were?

12:22.943 --> 12:24.342
Enough!

12:24.344 --> 12:26.244
Leave the boy alone.
He's been through hell;

12:26.246 --> 12:27.746
You don't need to hold
him over the coals.

12:27.748 --> 12:30.248
Are you hurt?

12:32.418 --> 12:35.186
No one will hurt you here.
I promise.

12:38.257 --> 12:40.325
The child knows something.

12:40.327 --> 12:41.960
He's just too frightened
to speak.

12:41.962 --> 12:43.361
To you;

12:43.363 --> 12:45.196
He's afraid of you.

12:45.198 --> 12:47.465
Perhaps the situation requires
a more delicate approach.

12:50.436 --> 12:54.072
From the duke I learned nothing.

12:54.074 --> 12:56.975
Well, nothing
of political interest.

12:58.377 --> 13:02.814
But this morning
I bed one of his lieutenants,

13:02.816 --> 13:05.350
Who was curious to see
what attractions

13:05.352 --> 13:06.451
I held for his master.

13:06.453 --> 13:08.186
(quietly laughs)

13:08.188 --> 13:10.221
Men.

13:10.223 --> 13:12.190
It always works.

13:12.192 --> 13:13.525
And was he
more forthcoming?

13:13.527 --> 13:15.326
Much.
Mm.

13:15.328 --> 13:18.029
He says king henry
refuses to delay

13:18.031 --> 13:20.465
While supplies and armies
are being replenished.

13:20.467 --> 13:22.801
He will not
wait on England.

13:22.803 --> 13:25.136
They've just returned from war.

13:25.138 --> 13:27.839
Henry said they'd take time
to celebrate calais.

13:27.841 --> 13:29.841
Mobilization has already begun.

13:29.843 --> 13:32.143
The offices are
being sworn to secrecy.

13:32.145 --> 13:34.345
The king means to attack England
within the week.

13:34.347 --> 13:37.482
He wants to slay elizabeth

13:37.484 --> 13:40.385
And put mary on the throne then.

13:40.387 --> 13:43.388
Bartos:
Good afternoon.
I'm looking for lord julien.

13:43.390 --> 13:44.455
Will you tell him
his uncle bartos

13:44.457 --> 13:45.990
Is here to see him?

13:45.992 --> 13:47.258
Benjamin:
Yes, sir.

13:47.260 --> 13:48.860
(door closes,
footsteps approach)

13:48.862 --> 13:51.462
Oh, bartos!
(laughs)

13:51.464 --> 13:53.331
How good to see you.

13:53.333 --> 13:55.166
You look positively road-weary.

13:55.168 --> 13:56.334
Please, come in.

13:56.336 --> 13:57.869
Thank you. Leave us.
We're fine here.

13:57.871 --> 14:00.205
Would the gentlemen...?
We're fine.

14:00.207 --> 14:01.372
What's all the fuss?

14:01.374 --> 14:02.507
And when did we
get so familiar?

14:02.509 --> 14:04.108
(door closes)

14:04.110 --> 14:06.477
I'm not here to be reunited
with a secretary;

14:06.479 --> 14:08.613
I want to talk to
my nephew directly.

14:08.615 --> 14:11.249
Remy...

14:12.952 --> 14:14.519
Where is he?
Where is lord julien?

14:14.521 --> 14:15.587
Uh-uh, lord julien's away.

14:15.589 --> 14:17.422
Where?

14:17.424 --> 14:19.490
He's been out of touch
with the family for months

14:19.492 --> 14:22.393
Gallivanting all over the
continent for nearly a year.

14:22.395 --> 14:24.462
The family sent me here

14:24.464 --> 14:26.497
To find him,
after we heard a rumor

14:26.499 --> 14:27.932
He'd been married
at french court.

14:27.934 --> 14:30.869
It's true, he's both married
and with child.

14:30.871 --> 14:32.437
He's hard to keep in check,

14:32.439 --> 14:34.339
But I'll start at
the tavern he favors.

14:34.341 --> 14:36.007
Uh, wh-where
are you staying?

14:36.009 --> 14:38.509
I'll come around with julien
as soon as I track him down.

14:38.511 --> 14:41.512
He's evading his family,
I don't know why,

14:41.514 --> 14:43.882
But those who finance
his disregard

14:43.884 --> 14:45.116
Deserve an explanation.

14:45.118 --> 14:49.020
I'll wait right here...

14:49.022 --> 14:50.121
For his return.

14:50.123 --> 14:52.657
(sighs)

14:52.659 --> 14:55.393
(door closes)

14:55.395 --> 14:56.628
I have to tell you something.

14:56.630 --> 14:57.996
I have to do it quickly

14:57.998 --> 14:59.230
And you have to hear
everything I say

14:59.232 --> 15:00.398
Beyond something
that'll shock you.

15:00.400 --> 15:02.133
I don't understand.

15:02.135 --> 15:05.136
I love you. That is who I am,
the man who loves you,

15:05.138 --> 15:06.137
But I'm not lord julien.

15:06.139 --> 15:08.606
What are you talking about?

15:08.608 --> 15:11.376
My real name is remy.

15:11.378 --> 15:14.045
I was lord julien's personal
secretary before he died.

15:14.047 --> 15:16.447
This is madness.

15:16.449 --> 15:18.683
(sighing)

15:18.685 --> 15:22.553
The real julien varga
died in a terrible fire.

15:22.555 --> 15:24.255
We were traveling
through bavaria.

15:24.257 --> 15:25.957
The inn we stopped at
burned to the ground.

15:25.959 --> 15:28.426
I was carrying julien's cloak,
with its crest.

15:28.428 --> 15:29.527
The local magistrate

15:29.529 --> 15:32.563
Assumed I was he.

15:32.565 --> 15:34.532
His life was there
for the taking.

15:34.534 --> 15:36.467
So I took it.

15:36.469 --> 15:39.537
I took it and then I met you
and I gave you a life...

15:39.539 --> 15:41.606
I gave us a life...

15:41.608 --> 15:43.308
A wonderful life.
For his money,

15:43.310 --> 15:46.577
Is that it?
You-you robbed a dead man?

15:46.579 --> 15:49.013
Yes. It was a decision
made in the moment,

15:49.015 --> 15:51.249
Because I saw suddenly
how easy it could be.

15:51.251 --> 15:54.319
He has a family far away,
whom he hated and rarely saw,

15:54.321 --> 15:55.586
Money he could never use.

15:55.588 --> 15:57.722
So I let the stipends
keep coming.

15:57.724 --> 15:59.524
But, eventually,
they wanted contact

15:59.526 --> 16:01.025
With their wandering son,
they wanted to see him.

16:01.027 --> 16:02.727
And then you met me.

16:02.729 --> 16:04.262
Good timing, was it?

16:04.264 --> 16:05.530
Because the stipends
got cut off?

16:05.532 --> 16:06.497
Do I have that right?

16:06.499 --> 16:08.066
Yes.

16:08.068 --> 16:09.067
You were going
to fleece me

16:09.069 --> 16:10.068
For all you could

16:10.070 --> 16:12.003
And then run
from your crime.

16:12.005 --> 16:14.439
The story you told
about being

16:14.441 --> 16:16.341
Disenfranchised
from your family,

16:16.343 --> 16:19.177
It all makes sense; they
weren't your family at all.

16:19.179 --> 16:21.612
Did you murder him?

16:21.614 --> 16:23.715
No. No. I did not.

16:23.717 --> 16:27.518
You might think I'm the
lowest form of grave robber,

16:27.520 --> 16:29.187
But I didn't kill him.

16:29.189 --> 16:31.622
And while I planned
to leave you, I didn't.

16:31.624 --> 16:33.725
I stayed, because
I fell in love with you.

16:33.727 --> 16:36.394
I risked everything
to be with you.

16:36.396 --> 16:39.030
I risked this day,
which I prayed would never come.

16:39.032 --> 16:40.298
Have you been caught?

16:40.300 --> 16:41.499
Is that why you're
telling me this now?

16:41.501 --> 16:45.136
There is a man
in the other room.

16:45.138 --> 16:48.406
He is lord julien's uncle,
sent by the family to find him.

16:48.408 --> 16:50.141
You can hate me
for the rest of your life.

16:50.143 --> 16:51.676
You can turn me in
to the authorities.

16:51.678 --> 16:55.546
All I ask is that you back me up

16:55.548 --> 16:58.116
For as long as it takes
to get him out of this house

16:58.118 --> 16:59.751
And out of our lives.

16:59.753 --> 17:02.587
I don't know who you are.

17:04.690 --> 17:06.124
But I'm not sure
I want him to leave,

17:06.126 --> 17:08.626
Because you terrify me.

17:10.195 --> 17:11.596
You're sure?

17:13.699 --> 17:15.299
He could just be
mobilizing against

17:15.301 --> 17:16.601
A counterattack on calais.

17:16.603 --> 17:18.236
A naval commander's
confirmed it.

17:18.238 --> 17:21.172
Henry has ordered a fleet
to set sail for England

17:21.174 --> 17:22.640
By week's end.

17:22.642 --> 17:24.175
You've seen the state
of the french army.

17:24.177 --> 17:25.710
If henry invades...

17:25.712 --> 17:28.613
We will be slaughtered.

17:28.615 --> 17:30.615
After calais,
we are depleted on all fronts.

17:30.617 --> 17:32.650
There must be some way
to reach him.

17:32.652 --> 17:35.153
Francis...

17:35.155 --> 17:38.790
Henry doesn't understand
right from wrong, or care.

17:38.792 --> 17:41.692
He's killed innocents,
he's shut out

17:41.694 --> 17:45.430
His closest advisors,
he's closed his mind to reason.

17:45.432 --> 17:47.498
No one can get through to him.
This has

17:47.500 --> 17:49.634
Gone on long enough;
he has to be stopped.

17:51.737 --> 17:54.272
No. Absolutely not.

17:54.274 --> 17:56.541
Don't get sentimental
about a father who was never

17:56.543 --> 17:59.277
Sentimental
about you.
But he is <i>my</i> father,

17:59.279 --> 18:00.578
And the king of France.

18:00.580 --> 18:02.413
We owe him our allegiance.

18:02.415 --> 18:04.482
Or how can we
expect it ourselves?

18:04.484 --> 18:06.484
He is sick.
He needs our help,

18:06.486 --> 18:09.187
Not to be put down
like some rabid dog.

18:09.189 --> 18:12.457
I need to get him
away from here,
away from the castle,

18:12.459 --> 18:14.258
Take him somewhere.

18:14.260 --> 18:16.360
A hunting trip.
Catherine:
A hunting trip?

18:16.362 --> 18:19.764
That's your solution?
We have said
before that

18:19.766 --> 18:21.532
He may be being poisoned
here in the castle

18:21.534 --> 18:23.501
By a means we have
not yet discovered.

18:23.503 --> 18:25.369
We have ruled
out poison.

18:25.371 --> 18:27.371
I am not convinced.

18:27.373 --> 18:30.441
I know what he has done
and what he has become...

18:30.443 --> 18:32.844
But I need one last chance
to break through to him.

18:32.846 --> 18:35.379
I need to make sure
that I have tried everything.

18:36.348 --> 18:37.748
All right.

18:37.750 --> 18:39.650
But whatever
you plan

18:39.652 --> 18:42.520
On doing, do it quickly--
we are running out of time.

18:42.522 --> 18:44.856
I  <i>will</i>reach him.

18:51.330 --> 18:54.799
You know as well as I do
there's no reaching henry.

18:54.801 --> 18:56.400
He's gone.

18:56.402 --> 18:59.403
We promised
francis time.
The time is now.

18:59.405 --> 19:02.573
Catherine, I can't.

19:02.575 --> 19:05.443
I-I'd be defying my husband...

19:05.445 --> 19:08.646
Betraying him,
murdering his father.
<i>My</i> husband...

19:08.648 --> 19:10.781
The father of <i>my</i> children...

19:10.783 --> 19:14.552
Handing over <i>my</i> crown to you
the moment francis is king.

19:14.554 --> 19:16.888
I can't think
about myself.

19:16.890 --> 19:20.258
We need to think
like queens now.

19:20.260 --> 19:22.260
Or thousands of men
will die needlessly

19:22.262 --> 19:25.263
In a war we are not prepared for
and we cannot win.

19:25.265 --> 19:28.900
We cannot save henry, but
we can still save those men.

19:28.902 --> 19:31.269
And we can spare francis

19:31.271 --> 19:33.237
From having to be a part

19:33.239 --> 19:35.473
Of his father's murder.

19:35.475 --> 19:37.508
There is some truth in that.

19:37.510 --> 19:39.177
(laughs):
And a strange kind of mercy.

19:39.179 --> 19:40.878
So it's settled, then.

19:40.880 --> 19:42.780
Together...

19:42.782 --> 19:45.716
You and I are going
to kill the king of France.

19:53.292 --> 19:56.761
Remy:
I realize we've talked around
your nephew's absence today.

19:56.763 --> 19:58.896
Yes, you've introduced me
to his very silent

19:58.898 --> 20:00.831
New wife.
Forgive my
directness,

20:00.833 --> 20:03.401
But I'd appreciate
some of the same.

20:05.604 --> 20:07.705
Where are the
servants?
I, uh,

20:07.707 --> 20:09.807
Sent them home--
as the truth

20:09.809 --> 20:11.976
Is a delicate matter.

20:11.978 --> 20:14.345
Lord julien's been
gone for some time.

20:14.347 --> 20:16.380
It was an issue of money.

20:16.382 --> 20:17.815
He had, uh,

20:17.817 --> 20:20.218
Gambling debts.
I knew he enjoyed cards...

20:20.220 --> 20:22.787
Remy: It was rather
a passion for him.

20:22.789 --> 20:24.922
One that sadly took precedence
over the passion he had

20:24.924 --> 20:26.724
For his wife.

20:26.726 --> 20:27.959
He was...

20:27.961 --> 20:29.894
Deeply in debt

20:29.896 --> 20:31.896
And fled
from those debts.

20:31.898 --> 20:33.231
My nephew

20:33.233 --> 20:34.398
Abandoned you?

20:34.400 --> 20:35.800
Remy: I-I can assure
you, the love he

20:35.802 --> 20:38.636
Bore his wife is true, and
that this is excruciating

20:38.638 --> 20:41.505
For lady lola
to discuss.
Is that so?

20:41.507 --> 20:43.975
How can anyone be sure
of someone who lies so easily,

20:43.977 --> 20:46.344
Who uses others
for what they can offer him,

20:46.346 --> 20:47.478
Regardless of the cost?

20:47.480 --> 20:49.313
Lola...
The cost is to me,

20:49.315 --> 20:50.848
To my reputation,
to my faith in another,

20:50.850 --> 20:52.817
In my husband,
a man I gave my heart to.

20:52.819 --> 20:54.685
Remy:
I assure you

20:54.687 --> 20:56.887
I can speak to his heart,
torn apart daily

20:56.889 --> 20:58.823
As his feelings
for you grew.

20:58.825 --> 21:01.392
Bartos: And I can
speak for the family.

21:01.394 --> 21:05.596
I had no idea about the depth of
my nephew's gambling problems.

21:05.598 --> 21:06.964
To see you left in this way.

21:06.966 --> 21:09.467
I feel shame for my nephew.

21:09.469 --> 21:12.937
I assure you, the family will
take care of you financially.

21:12.939 --> 21:14.872
And the child.

21:14.874 --> 21:16.974
You make a passionate case.

21:16.976 --> 21:18.809
If only julien had
your depth of feeling.

21:18.811 --> 21:21.846
If that's all there is

21:21.848 --> 21:24.515
To be said for now?

21:25.651 --> 21:26.917
Yes.

21:26.919 --> 21:28.319
For now.

21:29.888 --> 21:32.823
I must return home and alert
the rest of the family.

21:32.825 --> 21:34.859
Remy, if you see julien...

21:34.861 --> 21:37.662
Oh, of-of course.

21:37.664 --> 21:39.697
Wait.

21:39.699 --> 21:40.931
Is that julien's ring?

21:40.933 --> 21:42.933
What? (chuckles)

21:42.935 --> 21:45.936
That's julien's signet ring.

21:45.938 --> 21:49.373
Why are you wearing
my nephew's ring?

21:51.677 --> 21:53.311
You see? You're not so scary

21:53.313 --> 21:54.979
Under all that blood.

21:54.981 --> 21:56.380
We really should get
you a proper bath

21:56.382 --> 21:58.849
And some lovely covers
to sleep under.

21:58.851 --> 22:00.951
You know, when I
was a little girl,

22:00.953 --> 22:03.888
My mother had a blanket
made of fleece.

22:03.890 --> 22:05.456
How do you stay warm?

22:05.458 --> 22:07.925
Do your parents let
you sleep beside them?

22:07.927 --> 22:09.527
Where are you parents?

22:09.529 --> 22:11.796
They must be worried that
you're cold or hurt.

22:11.798 --> 22:13.464
They're dead.

22:16.101 --> 22:18.035
I'm sorry.

22:18.037 --> 22:20.805
But you needn't fear
that they're worrying.

22:20.807 --> 22:22.440
I'm sure they're looking
at you right now.

22:22.442 --> 22:24.642
And they can see
that you're safe.

22:24.644 --> 22:26.477
Can you tell me
what happened to them?

22:26.479 --> 22:29.380
Then will you tell me
what happened to you?

22:29.382 --> 22:31.382
So we can make sure it never
happens to anyone else.

22:31.384 --> 22:34.118
Visegard.

22:34.120 --> 22:37.121
What?

22:37.123 --> 22:39.056
What's "visegard"?

22:39.058 --> 22:41.025
Boy: A bad place
in the mountains.

22:41.027 --> 22:42.560
He took me there.

22:42.562 --> 22:43.994
Who did?

22:43.996 --> 22:46.530
The man with the sharp teeth.

22:49.668 --> 22:51.669
Mary:
He's on a hunt.

22:51.671 --> 22:54.638
He could have an accident
on his way back.
What, a stray arrow?

22:54.640 --> 22:57.108
No, it's too dangerous
with francis at his side.

22:57.110 --> 22:58.676
What about poison?

22:58.678 --> 23:00.478
Could you get something
past his tasters?

23:00.480 --> 23:02.146
I tried that recently.

23:02.148 --> 23:03.681
It backfired.

23:03.683 --> 23:05.950
I can't see a way.

23:08.587 --> 23:11.122
I've never known you
to wilt from a challenge.

23:11.124 --> 23:13.424
Certainly not when you
were trying to get rid of me.

23:13.426 --> 23:15.159
You're a very

23:15.161 --> 23:17.094
Imaginative murderer.
There must be a way.

23:21.400 --> 23:24.068
There is one time to get to him.

23:24.070 --> 23:25.736
<i>Communion.</i>

23:25.738 --> 23:27.905
<i>He's been taking mass alone.</i>

23:27.907 --> 23:30.074
<i>There are no tasters,</i>
<i>no guards.</i>

23:30.076 --> 23:32.910
<i>And he feels absolutely safe.</i>

23:32.912 --> 23:36.080
These are
for a private mass.

23:36.082 --> 23:39.150
Catherine:
<i>Just him, a priest</i>
<i>and the almighty god.</i>

23:40.952 --> 23:43.020
We will have one chance at this.

23:43.022 --> 23:45.189
We won't get another.

23:45.191 --> 23:46.557
And if we succeed,

23:46.559 --> 23:50.161
I'll be a widow.

23:50.163 --> 23:53.164
And francis will rule.

23:54.633 --> 23:57.101
Long live the king.

24:05.877 --> 24:07.778
I've never heard of any town
called visegard.

24:07.780 --> 24:10.014
What do you hope to find there?

24:10.016 --> 24:11.549
The boy was neither
sacrificed nor fed upon.

24:11.551 --> 24:13.551
Yet the darkness brought him
there for some reason.

24:13.553 --> 24:14.985
If we find this place,
it may hold clues.

24:14.987 --> 24:17.455
It may even
be a place the darkness resides.

24:17.457 --> 24:19.990
And what makes you think that?

24:19.992 --> 24:21.192
When pagans spill blood
to feed the darkness,

24:21.194 --> 24:22.726
They have to bring it somewhere.

24:22.728 --> 24:24.462
You don't even know
where this town is.

24:24.464 --> 24:28.032
It could be days away.

24:28.034 --> 24:29.834
You said that when you return,
that you would take me

24:29.836 --> 24:32.036
To our new home, that you
would get me away from henry.

24:32.038 --> 24:33.971
Perhaps I should leave you.

24:33.973 --> 24:36.140
No, we have business still.

24:36.142 --> 24:37.575
You're right.

24:37.577 --> 24:38.642
Pack your things.

24:38.644 --> 24:40.077
We'll leave tonight.

24:46.218 --> 24:48.052
I'll think of some excuse.

24:48.054 --> 24:49.720
You're not planning
to go with her?

24:49.722 --> 24:51.555
I can't involve her in this.

24:51.557 --> 24:53.991
If I tell her what I know, I
have to tell her how I know it.

24:53.993 --> 24:56.093
How you know what exactly?

24:56.095 --> 24:57.761
That visegard is more
than just a place.

24:57.763 --> 24:59.096
It's a pagan word.

24:59.098 --> 25:01.165
It means "where darkness rises."

25:01.167 --> 25:03.767
And that I know this

25:03.769 --> 25:05.603
Because I was born a pagan.

25:05.605 --> 25:08.138
Is that why you've
taken this on?

25:08.140 --> 25:11.141
Because you feel some blame for
the blood spilled by this faith?

25:11.143 --> 25:12.776
It's more than just that.

25:12.778 --> 25:15.112
I was forced to kill two men
in those woods--

25:15.114 --> 25:18.516
A zealot of the faith
and an innocent.

25:18.518 --> 25:21.285
And ever since then, I have

25:21.287 --> 25:23.654
A darkness in me that I despise.

25:23.656 --> 25:26.123
The darkness touched us all.

25:26.125 --> 25:27.925
It tortured olivia.

25:27.927 --> 25:30.060
If you're going
to search for visegard,

25:30.062 --> 25:33.097
I'm going with you.

25:33.099 --> 25:36.066
There is nothing quite like

25:36.068 --> 25:37.668
The feast of a fresh kill.

25:37.670 --> 25:40.137
I feel cleaner.

25:40.139 --> 25:41.305
Stronger.

25:41.307 --> 25:43.207
Ready to take on England.

25:45.877 --> 25:48.812
But to stage an invasion now,

25:48.814 --> 25:51.682
Before we have
replenished our forces,

25:51.684 --> 25:54.251
Is it not better to wait?

26:01.092 --> 26:05.229
You know, francis...

26:05.231 --> 26:08.966
We should have done this
a long time ago.

26:08.968 --> 26:14.171
All those hunting trips
I shared with your brother,

26:14.173 --> 26:16.941
I regret not having had
these moments with you.

26:20.946 --> 26:24.014
Why do you push so hard
to conquer England?

26:27.085 --> 26:29.186
Perhaps I am...

26:29.188 --> 26:32.056
More ambitious than most kings.

26:32.058 --> 26:35.092
It was my father
who taught me to push hard.

26:35.094 --> 26:40.297
Oh, he expected
a great deal from his sons.

26:40.299 --> 26:43.000
Did you know he was captured
by the spaniards?

26:45.637 --> 26:48.639
I was six or seven at the time.

26:48.641 --> 26:50.641
They imprisoned him in madrid,

26:50.643 --> 26:54.144
Under the cruelest conditions.

26:54.146 --> 26:57.114
One day, my brother and I
were taken to visit him.

26:57.116 --> 27:00.651
He saw our boat
and he ran to us.

27:00.653 --> 27:03.887
I ran to him.

27:03.889 --> 27:06.824
He passed us by
and jumped in the boat.

27:06.826 --> 27:11.996
We'd been traded as hostages
for his freedom.

27:13.164 --> 27:16.066
Why did he let that happen?

27:20.271 --> 27:23.273
He was the one who arranged it.

27:27.045 --> 27:31.048
Sons must sacrifice

27:31.050 --> 27:32.950
For their fathers.

27:32.952 --> 27:36.120
This is the lesson.

27:36.122 --> 27:40.858
I learned it with my brother,

27:40.860 --> 27:43.027
Beaten and starved
for three years.

27:43.029 --> 27:46.196
Father...

27:46.198 --> 27:48.432
When we returned...

27:50.268 --> 27:53.704
...There was no loving embrace.

27:59.077 --> 28:02.312
He was a hard man to please.

28:04.416 --> 28:07.084
Like god.

28:09.454 --> 28:13.223
Father, it wasn't right.

28:13.225 --> 28:16.326
What he did to you,
it wasn't right.

28:17.862 --> 28:19.863
I believe

28:19.865 --> 28:22.700
In a loving god.

28:22.702 --> 28:26.036
And I believe his work
is done by people like you,

28:26.038 --> 28:28.372
And you have so much
more to do in France

28:28.374 --> 28:31.442
Before you turn to England.

28:31.444 --> 28:35.212
You have already
achieved the glory.

28:35.214 --> 28:36.914
Now do the good.

28:41.352 --> 28:44.054
Yes, of course.

28:44.056 --> 28:48.926
There are things to do
in France first.

28:53.465 --> 28:55.199
I tell you, he asked me
to keep the ring so that

28:55.201 --> 28:57.367
He wouldn't gamble away
a family keepsake.

28:57.369 --> 28:59.403
Bartos, what are
you looking for?

28:59.405 --> 29:01.905
Bartos:
Julien is a large man.
I see no boots

29:01.907 --> 29:04.308
His size, no cloaks
that would fit him.

29:04.310 --> 29:06.310
There's no trace of
my nephew anywhere.

29:06.312 --> 29:09.246
You're making an ordeal
out of nothing.

29:09.248 --> 29:11.348
Benjamin:
Begging your pardon, mistress,
I left my gloves...

29:11.350 --> 29:12.750
Lola:
Not now, benjamin.

29:12.752 --> 29:14.985
Benjamin:
As they're
my only pair...

29:14.987 --> 29:16.854
Please be on your way.
You there.
You work

29:16.856 --> 29:18.388
For the master of
this house, do you not?

29:18.390 --> 29:20.858
This is a private matter.
Just go.
Where is he?

29:20.860 --> 29:22.926
Where is lord julien?

29:22.928 --> 29:25.229
He's standing right there.

29:25.231 --> 29:27.498
But this man is...

29:27.500 --> 29:31.001
This man...

29:31.003 --> 29:33.036
And this woman?

29:33.038 --> 29:34.138
Benjamin:
His wife,

29:34.140 --> 29:35.973
My lord, lady lola.

29:35.975 --> 29:38.876
Get out, benjamin.
Just go.

29:38.878 --> 29:41.845
You took my nephew's name.

29:41.847 --> 29:43.380
What else did you take?
I never harmed him.

29:43.382 --> 29:44.848
I promise you.
Remy,

29:44.850 --> 29:45.983
Just tell him what happened.

29:45.985 --> 29:49.019
Is he still alive? Answer me.

29:49.021 --> 29:51.054
It was an accident,
I swear...

29:51.056 --> 29:51.922
You killed him.

29:51.924 --> 29:55.259
Let go, let go!
Stop it! Stop it, please!

29:55.261 --> 29:57.027
I'll kill you...
Let go of him!

29:57.029 --> 29:58.562
(grunting)

30:00.165 --> 30:01.398
(gasps)

30:03.067 --> 30:05.235
My god.

30:05.237 --> 30:07.271
I killed him.

30:09.274 --> 30:12.042
I have to go now.
I'm moving today.

30:12.044 --> 30:14.077
But I wanted you to know
that these ladies are going
to look after you.

30:14.079 --> 30:17.080
They're the kindest governesses
in the castle.

30:17.082 --> 30:19.082
It's for the best.

30:19.084 --> 30:21.952
They're gonna take much better
care of you than I ever could.

30:23.988 --> 30:28.458
Um, my mother gave this to me
when I left scotland.

30:28.460 --> 30:30.894
She said
it would always keep me safe.

30:30.896 --> 30:33.964
I wanted you
to have it.

30:35.900 --> 30:37.434
Please don't leave me.

30:37.436 --> 30:40.070
They'll burn me.

30:42.273 --> 30:45.042
Go.

30:45.044 --> 30:47.544
Why would you say that?

30:51.049 --> 30:53.050
You worship the gods,

30:53.052 --> 30:56.553
Not god, don't you?

30:56.555 --> 30:58.922
I don't care
if you're a pagan.

30:58.924 --> 31:01.158
I'm never going
to let anybody hurt you.

31:01.160 --> 31:04.561
Would you like to come
and stay with me?

31:04.563 --> 31:06.964
Just for a while?

31:06.966 --> 31:10.300
You know, I don't even know
your name.

31:11.502 --> 31:14.638
Pascal.

31:16.040 --> 31:17.074
Mary, I did it.

31:17.076 --> 31:18.942
What?
I convinced him

31:18.944 --> 31:20.177
To postpone the invasion.

31:20.179 --> 31:22.179
France is safe.

31:22.181 --> 31:24.047
He listened
to me.

31:24.049 --> 31:26.016
His sanity started
trickling back in,

31:26.018 --> 31:28.285
And for a moment I could
actually see my father again.

31:30.321 --> 31:32.422
I'm not saying that he's cured.

31:32.424 --> 31:35.125
That may
take time.

31:35.127 --> 31:37.494
What is it? What's wrong?

31:40.064 --> 31:41.398
How much time?

31:41.400 --> 31:42.666
How can you be sure?

31:42.668 --> 31:44.668
I'm not.
Then you agree,

31:44.670 --> 31:46.503
We can't risk it.
Risk what?

31:46.505 --> 31:48.071
Letting him live?

31:49.507 --> 31:53.410
Mary... What have you done?

32:00.351 --> 32:02.085
Francis:
<i>It's not too late!</i>

32:02.087 --> 32:05.122
He has agreed
not to invade England!

32:05.124 --> 32:06.356
He saw reason!

32:06.358 --> 32:07.591
He's getting better!

32:07.593 --> 32:09.126
Do you hear me?!

32:09.128 --> 32:10.460
Well, if there's
hope, maybe.

32:10.462 --> 32:12.162
There is hope!
I've seen it!

32:12.164 --> 32:13.530
You have to stop this right now!

32:18.036 --> 32:20.270
<i>In nomine patri et fili</i>

32:20.272 --> 32:22.139
Et spiritus sancti.

32:22.141 --> 32:23.340
Amen.

32:44.028 --> 32:46.129
Who sent you?!

32:46.131 --> 32:47.998
(grunting)

32:48.000 --> 32:49.533
Who sent you?!

32:50.735 --> 32:52.469
Who?!

33:00.178 --> 33:02.479
Man:
Your majesty, the duke of guise.

33:04.148 --> 33:06.550
My friend! You're the only one
I can trust.

33:06.552 --> 33:08.752
I must speak with you.

33:08.754 --> 33:11.088
Alone.

33:11.090 --> 33:13.123
Francis:
<i>I thought your plan was</i>
<i>to poison him.</i>

33:13.125 --> 33:15.392
It was. I stopped it.
I got to the priest in time.

33:15.394 --> 33:18.028
If you didn't send the assassin,
who did?

33:18.030 --> 33:20.230
I don't know.
But I can't help but notice

33:20.232 --> 33:21.732
Who's benefited the most.

33:21.734 --> 33:24.067
Who's come out of this smelling
like a rose.

33:24.069 --> 33:26.436
My uncle.

33:26.438 --> 33:28.005
<i>How did he know the specifics</i>
<i>of our plan?</i>

33:28.007 --> 33:30.007
<i>That we called it off?</i>

33:30.009 --> 33:31.341
Catherine:
<i>He has spies, surely.</i>

33:31.343 --> 33:33.477
<i>What if he's playing</i>
<i>both sides?</i>

33:33.479 --> 33:36.780
What if he warned the king
of an attempt on his life?

33:36.782 --> 33:39.616
If we succeed in spite
of this, job done:

33:39.618 --> 33:42.319
Francis becomes king
and the duke benefits

33:42.321 --> 33:44.321
From his promise
of a position at court.

33:44.323 --> 33:45.689
If we fail...

33:45.691 --> 33:47.290
Then the duke is the man
who warned the king.

33:47.292 --> 33:51.194
He still benefits
because he gains
my father's trust.

33:51.196 --> 33:55.298
The only complication was
our calling off the attempt.

33:55.300 --> 33:57.334
The duke's already
warned the king;

33:57.336 --> 34:00.704
He looks like a hysterical
fool if nothing happens.

34:00.706 --> 34:03.507
So he makes
something happen.

34:03.509 --> 34:06.209
Sometimes, to sell a pail
of water, you start a fire.

34:06.211 --> 34:09.679
If this is true, then the king
will listen to no one

34:09.681 --> 34:11.148
But the duke from now on.

34:11.150 --> 34:12.516
He   <i>wa</i>listening to me.

34:12.518 --> 34:14.217
Do you both realize
how much danger you're in

34:14.219 --> 34:15.719
Because of what
you've done?

34:15.721 --> 34:18.188
The good news is
we're both still alive,

34:18.190 --> 34:20.791
So henry
doesn't suspect us... Yet.

34:20.793 --> 34:23.593
But his paranoia
is awakened.

34:23.595 --> 34:25.362
We'll never get
another chance.

34:25.364 --> 34:27.798
Henry's untouchable now.

34:29.567 --> 34:31.301
God help us all.

34:32.236 --> 34:36.206
I lie behind

this life's good-bye.

Bash:
Of course.
He'll be in good hands.

34:44.450 --> 34:48.085
As will you.
These men will escort you home

34:48.087 --> 34:50.654
And stand guard
until I return.

34:50.656 --> 34:52.823
I knew this would happen.
