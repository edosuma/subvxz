<i>aways of dealing with nerves.</i>

00:04.033 --> 00:06.801
It'll just be a few more
minutes, Mr. Stinson.

00:06.869 --> 00:08.803
<i>Some people chew their nails.</i>

00:08.871 --> 00:10.805
<i>Some people tap their feet.</i>

00:10.863 --> 00:13.007
<i>And some people imagine
they're being interviewed</i>

00:13.075 --> 00:15.376
<i>by renowned sportscaster
Jim Nantz.</i>

00:15.443 --> 00:16.638
Hello, friends.

00:16.639 --> 00:20.178
Every sport has had an icon
who transcends the game.

00:20.179 --> 00:22.581
Boxing had Ali,
basketball had Jordan,

00:22.582 --> 00:25.612
and the sport of sleeping
with random hotties

00:25.613 --> 00:28.278
has my next guest,
Mr. Barney Stinson.

00:28.279 --> 00:29.744
Barney, welcome.
Thanks, Jim.

00:29.745 --> 00:31.178
Great to be back
on the show.

00:31.179 --> 00:32.310
Good to have
you with us.

00:32.311 --> 00:33.442
And, you know,
the stats,

00:33.443 --> 00:34.909
they really speak
for themselves.

00:34.910 --> 00:37.447
Over 200 women spanning
six continents,

00:37.448 --> 00:38.852
17 nationalities,

00:38.853 --> 00:42.454
74 sexual positions
and not a single fatty.

00:42.455 --> 00:43.655
It's impressive.

00:43.656 --> 00:46.194
Hey, uh, with all
these accomplishments, though,

00:46.195 --> 00:48.730
there's one laurel
that's always eluded you.

00:48.731 --> 00:50.300
Which brings us to last week.

00:50.301 --> 00:51.701
What was the story there?

00:51.702 --> 00:52.802
Buckle up, Jimbo,

00:52.803 --> 00:54.839
this one's a doozy.

00:54.840 --> 00:56.408
<i>It all started when I decided</i>

00:56.409 --> 00:58.277
<i>to set myself
a little challenge.</i>

00:58.278 --> 01:00.379
Oh, my God.
Whoa.

01:00.380 --> 01:01.748
He's calling his shot.

01:01.749 --> 01:03.850
Whatever girl I'm
pointing to right now,

01:03.851 --> 01:05.787
that's who I'm going
home with tonight.

01:05.788 --> 01:07.188
And...

01:09.158 --> 01:11.493
Play ball!

01:12.396 --> 01:14.964
Hey.
Hey.

01:14.965 --> 01:17.000
How'd the date
with Dale go?

01:17.001 --> 01:20.137
You know, sometimes, that guy
with the horn-rimmed glasses

01:20.138 --> 01:22.139
and the Smurfs T-shirt
is just being ironic.

01:22.140 --> 01:23.673
Sometimes,

01:23.674 --> 01:25.809
he is a dork
with a lazy eye

01:25.810 --> 01:28.079
and a love-hate relationship
with Gargamel.

01:28.080 --> 01:30.047
Robin, just because
a guy talks a lot

01:30.048 --> 01:32.048
about a fictional character
on a first date

01:32.049 --> 01:33.951
doesn't mean he's not
husband material.

01:33.952 --> 01:36.085
Sasquatch isn't fictional.

01:36.086 --> 01:37.720
That was quick.

01:40.923 --> 01:43.591
So, night one was
pretty routine.

01:43.592 --> 01:47.027
Jim, there is nothing routine
about the way I get down.

01:47.028 --> 01:48.428
Respect.

01:48.429 --> 01:50.196
Take us to night two.

01:50.197 --> 01:52.897
See that hottie over there
nursing a Black Russian?

01:52.898 --> 01:54.866
She's about to chase that
with a white American.

01:54.867 --> 01:56.300
Up top!

01:57.837 --> 01:59.171
You know...

01:59.172 --> 02:01.473
if you're not careful,
you're going to lose me.

02:03.576 --> 02:04.877
You guys,
what should I say

02:04.878 --> 02:06.512
when Dale calls
for a second date?

02:06.513 --> 02:07.646
How do you know
he's going to call?

02:07.647 --> 02:10.049
(laughs)

02:10.050 --> 02:11.751
You're cute, Marshall.

02:11.752 --> 02:15.755
But I think Mama knows
when a dude's digging the show.

02:15.756 --> 02:18.692
I mean, he couldn't keep
his good eye off me.

02:18.693 --> 02:19.760
TED:
Well, let him down easy.

02:19.761 --> 02:21.262
People are fragile.

02:21.263 --> 02:23.731
And sometimes, without
even meaning to,

02:23.732 --> 02:26.734
you might rip someone's
beating heart out

02:26.735 --> 02:29.370
and stomp on it in a
room full of 26 people

02:29.371 --> 02:31.539
and a teacher's
assistant.

02:31.540 --> 02:33.709
How did school
go today, Ted?

02:33.710 --> 02:35.277
Something bad happened.

02:35.278 --> 02:37.846
It was the first class
of the new semester...

02:37.847 --> 02:39.614
Jamie Adamic.

02:39.950 --> 02:41.383
Hi.

02:41.384 --> 02:42.885
Brian Glow-atz.

02:42.886 --> 02:44.487
Glau-atz?

02:44.488 --> 02:46.388
Hi.

02:47.824 --> 02:49.726
Well done.

02:49.727 --> 02:51.727
Adding a fake name
to the sign-up sheet.

02:51.728 --> 02:53.696
That's, uh... that's
real original, guys.

02:53.697 --> 02:55.265
You know, I'd expect

02:55.266 --> 02:58.401
inspired minds such as yours
to be a little more mature,

02:58.402 --> 03:00.169
and frankly, more creative.

03:00.170 --> 03:01.370
I mean, seriously.

03:01.371 --> 03:04.373
What kind of a fake name
is Cook Pu?

03:04.374 --> 03:06.375
Here. (laughs) Come on, guys.

03:06.376 --> 03:08.276
It's got to at least sound real.

03:08.277 --> 03:10.245
Cook Pu?

03:10.246 --> 03:11.813
Here.

03:11.814 --> 03:13.147
Whatever happened
to the classics?

03:13.148 --> 03:14.115
Right, you know?

03:14.116 --> 03:15.383
Seymour Butts.

03:15.384 --> 03:16.384
Hugh Gerection.

03:16.385 --> 03:19.087
Those were fake names,
but Cook Pu?

03:19.088 --> 03:20.589
(crying):
Here.

03:20.590 --> 03:22.257
Cook Pu!

03:22.258 --> 03:24.693
She's back here, bro.

03:27.096 --> 03:28.263
(laughing)

03:28.264 --> 03:29.965
All right, come on,
let me have it.

03:29.966 --> 03:31.633
Bring on all the
Cook Pu jokes.

03:31.634 --> 03:33.735
Oh, we're not going
to make jokes, Ted.

03:33.736 --> 03:36.571
I mean, that girl must be
really down in the dumps.

03:36.572 --> 03:37.872
MARSHALL:
You really...

03:37.873 --> 03:39.507
smeared the Pu name.

03:39.508 --> 03:41.142
You guys finished?

03:41.143 --> 03:44.412
Are you asking us if all the Pu
is out of our system?

03:44.413 --> 03:46.180
(laughing)

03:46.181 --> 03:48.048
LILY:
Wow, back-to-back nights.

03:48.049 --> 03:50.751
Barney is on fire.

03:50.752 --> 03:51.852
That girl's lucky.

03:51.853 --> 03:54.054
Barney was the best sex
I ever had.

03:54.055 --> 03:56.189
He's the best friend
I've ever had.

03:56.190 --> 03:57.858
He's everything I
want Marshall to be.

03:57.859 --> 03:59.627
He's everything
I wish I could be.

03:59.628 --> 04:02.563
I'm just assuming that's what
they say when I'm not around.

04:02.564 --> 04:04.531
I buy it. You're awesome.

04:04.532 --> 04:06.133
Now, night three.

04:06.134 --> 04:07.701
Paint us a word picture.

04:07.702 --> 04:09.904
Jim, I could tell
I was on a roll,

04:09.905 --> 04:12.774
so I decided to mix things up
a little bit.

04:12.775 --> 04:16.712
I think I'm going to go
small boobs tonight.

04:16.713 --> 04:18.247
You're disgusting.

04:18.248 --> 04:20.815
Lily, they're
people, too.

04:22.452 --> 04:24.153
Here's your burgers.
Oh, thank you.

04:24.154 --> 04:25.721
Thanks. TED: What,
you're not sharing?

04:25.722 --> 04:27.757
You two always share a burger.

04:27.758 --> 04:28.925
No, we don't.

04:28.926 --> 04:30.660
We're not like weirdos
who share everything.

04:30.661 --> 04:32.296
Uh, yeah, you are.
That's exactly what you are.

04:32.297 --> 04:33.998
We're perfectly normal!

04:33.999 --> 04:35.499
Guys, what's going on?

04:35.500 --> 04:36.967
You know how Lily and I

04:36.968 --> 04:38.669
have been looking
for new couple friends

04:38.670 --> 04:40.604
ever since we lost
Robin and Barney,

04:40.605 --> 04:42.006
and Ted and Stella,

04:42.007 --> 04:44.275
and Ted and Robin,
and Ted and Victoria?

04:44.276 --> 04:46.610
Geez, Ted, when are you going
to get your life together?

04:46.611 --> 04:48.045
How did we end up here?

04:48.046 --> 04:50.714
We went on a great
double date last night.

04:50.715 --> 04:52.082
It... we were cool.

04:52.083 --> 04:53.150
We were casual.

04:53.151 --> 04:54.485
We didn't spaz out.

04:54.486 --> 04:57.254
And then, one tiny
little detail came out

04:57.255 --> 04:59.356
and the whole night
was ruined. Ruined!

04:59.357 --> 05:00.757
(laughter)
And Joanna's toothbrush

05:00.758 --> 05:02.558
flips off the side
of the sink,

05:02.559 --> 05:05.194
hits the ceiling and falls
right into the toilet.

05:05.195 --> 05:07.196
Come on.
That's... That's crazy.

05:07.197 --> 05:10.198
Last week, the same thing
happened to our toothbrush.

05:11.000 --> 05:16.437
<i>Our toothbrush?</i>

05:16.438 --> 05:17.971
Yeah.

05:17.972 --> 05:19.607
Like, one toothbrush?

05:19.608 --> 05:22.109
That you both use?

05:22.110 --> 05:23.844
Every day?

05:23.845 --> 05:25.380
Is that weird?

05:25.381 --> 05:28.449
ALL:
Super weird.

05:28.450 --> 05:30.117
Marshall, four
out of five dentists

05:30.118 --> 05:32.353
just threw up
in their mouths.

05:32.354 --> 05:34.289
Hey, check it out.

05:34.290 --> 05:35.524
Barney's leaving
with another girl.

05:35.525 --> 05:36.758
LILY:
Wow.

05:36.759 --> 05:38.427
Three girls in
three nights.

05:38.428 --> 05:40.329
That's gross,
even for Barney.

05:40.330 --> 05:41.397
Gross? Are you kidding?

05:41.398 --> 05:42.865
He's on his way
to a perfect...

05:42.866 --> 05:45.535
(stammering):
Don't say it!

05:45.536 --> 05:46.603
You'll jinx it.

05:46.604 --> 05:47.838
Jinx what?

05:47.839 --> 05:49.840
I was on my way toward...

05:49.841 --> 05:53.211
a perfect week.

05:59.719 --> 06:03.155
Transcript by Addic7ed.com

06:06.025 --> 06:08.094
The perfect week.

06:08.095 --> 06:11.497
Seven nights, seven girls,
zero rejections.

06:11.498 --> 06:12.731
Incredible.

06:12.732 --> 06:15.200
I mean, it's really
like the sexual equivalent

06:15.201 --> 06:17.468
of baseball's perfect game,
but even rarer.

06:17.469 --> 06:19.570
Yeah.
Uh, the only player in history

06:19.571 --> 06:21.439
to have ever achieved both

06:21.440 --> 06:24.441
was Mustache Pete Drexell
back in 1896.

06:24.442 --> 06:28.144
(crowd cheering,
lively organ music playing)

06:28.145 --> 06:29.446
Now, this wasn't
the first time

06:29.447 --> 06:31.281
you'd come close
to a perfect week.

06:31.282 --> 06:33.515
You learned the hard way,
though-

06:33.516 --> 06:35.918
one mistake, and it's all over.

06:35.919 --> 06:38.320
<i>Sometimes,
a teammate makes an error.</i>

06:40.490 --> 06:43.026
<i>Sometimes, one wild pitch...</i>

06:43.027 --> 06:46.796
You, me, the canned food aisle
in the bodega next door.

06:46.797 --> 06:48.864
<i>...leads to a walk.</i>

06:48.865 --> 06:52.701
<i>And sometimes,
you just lose focus.</i>

06:52.702 --> 06:56.738
<i>And that almost always leads
to a hit.</i>

06:56.739 --> 06:59.408
But this week,
you were three for three

06:59.409 --> 07:01.543
with no sign of slowing down.

07:01.544 --> 07:03.345
I could do no wrong.

07:03.346 --> 07:06.148
Wish I could say the same
for my friends.

07:06.149 --> 07:09.118
Cook didn't show up
for class today.

07:09.119 --> 07:10.452
I'm sorry.

07:10.453 --> 07:12.187
Cook?

07:12.188 --> 07:15.957
Yeah, Ted, we know, like,
a ton of people named Cook.

07:15.958 --> 07:17.259
Yeah.

07:18.127 --> 07:20.128
Cook Pu.

07:20.129 --> 07:22.097
(laughter, phone ringing)

07:22.098 --> 07:23.932
Uh-oh, here we go.

07:23.933 --> 07:25.567
The dreaded Dale call.

07:25.568 --> 07:27.903
Oh. It's my mom.

07:27.904 --> 07:31.174
She's going through some pretty
major league health stuff.

07:31.175 --> 07:33.009
God, why won't
that guy call?

07:33.010 --> 07:34.410
LILY:
Wait a minute.

07:34.411 --> 07:36.580
You want him to call?

07:36.581 --> 07:38.081
No! Shut up.

07:38.082 --> 07:39.583
Don't you guys
have, like, a...

07:39.584 --> 07:41.818
like, a toothbrush
to share or something?

07:41.819 --> 07:44.421
TED: Yeah. When did you guys
even start doing that anyway?

07:44.422 --> 07:45.456
Like, years ago.

07:45.457 --> 07:47.325
You should know.
We lived with you.

07:47.326 --> 07:48.459
Uh, yeah,
but you always

07:48.460 --> 07:49.727
kept your toothbrush
in the bedroom.

07:49.728 --> 07:52.064
Also weird, by
the way. LILY: No.

07:52.065 --> 07:53.532
We kept it
in the bathroom.

07:53.533 --> 07:55.601
No, there was only one
toothbrush in the bathroom,

07:55.602 --> 07:57.736
and it was mine.

07:59.839 --> 08:01.773
Wait.

08:01.774 --> 08:05.744
Are you saying that,
for eight years,

08:05.745 --> 08:09.013
all three of you
shared one toothbrush?

08:09.014 --> 08:10.182
Oh, my God. TED: Kill me.

08:10.183 --> 08:13.318
Kill me!
I love this so much.

08:17.723 --> 08:19.123
So, you're through four nights.

08:19.124 --> 08:20.425
You're over the hump.

08:20.426 --> 08:21.359
Nice, Jim.

08:21.360 --> 08:23.494
Hey, I try.
I'm no you.

08:23.495 --> 08:24.761
(both chuckling)

08:24.762 --> 08:28.965
But then came night five,
and with it, trouble.

08:30.534 --> 08:32.034
Beer here.

08:35.438 --> 08:36.972
Hey.

08:37.907 --> 08:39.073
Hey.

08:39.075 --> 08:40.775
How's, uh... how's Barney
doing tonight?

08:40.777 --> 08:41.909
Cool as a cucumber.

08:41.910 --> 08:43.510
Just like he's been all week.

08:43.511 --> 08:44.612
Yeah? That's hard
to believe.

08:44.613 --> 08:45.847
Why?

08:45.848 --> 08:48.017
Apparently, this big merger
fell through last week

08:48.018 --> 08:49.351
and Barney's
being blamed for it.

08:49.352 --> 08:50.619
Oh, that's weird.

08:50.620 --> 08:52.054
He hasn't said
anything.

08:52.055 --> 08:53.322
Look, I work
with the guy.

08:53.323 --> 08:54.856
I didn't find out
until this afternoon,

08:54.857 --> 08:56.592
when I walked
by his boss's office.

08:56.593 --> 08:58.260
...you cost this company,
Stinson?!

08:58.261 --> 09:01.030
<i>I'd never seen Barney
look that scared.</i>

09:01.031 --> 09:03.866
I... I think he's
going to get fired.

09:10.451 --> 09:12.319
I can't believe Barney
might get fired.

09:12.320 --> 09:13.887
Yeah, they're having
a meeting on Friday

09:13.888 --> 09:16.223
to determine whether or not
he keeps his job.

09:16.224 --> 09:18.325
Poor guy.
He must be freaking out.

09:18.326 --> 09:20.362
Yeah, I'm going to go talk
to him. (stammering): No!

09:20.363 --> 09:21.663
You can't distract a man

09:21.664 --> 09:23.765
in the middle of a...
you-know-what.

09:23.766 --> 09:25.366
Oh, come on,
this is his career.

09:25.367 --> 09:28.202
This is much more important
than some stupid perfect...

09:28.203 --> 09:29.303
Ah!

09:29.304 --> 09:31.038
O- Okay.

09:31.039 --> 09:33.307
You can lick my hand
as long as you want.

09:33.308 --> 09:36.144
I'm not going to let you
ruin his... Ow!

09:36.145 --> 09:38.145
Guys, we need
to talk to him.

09:38.146 --> 09:39.381
I'll go.

09:39.382 --> 09:41.182
He needs a bro.

09:42.985 --> 09:44.486
Hey, buddy.
Hey.

09:44.487 --> 09:45.620
Everything all right?

09:45.621 --> 09:47.122
Absolutely. Sure.

09:47.123 --> 09:48.523
Top of the world.

09:48.524 --> 09:49.691
(sighs)

09:49.692 --> 09:51.159
Who am I kidding?

09:51.160 --> 09:52.560
I need your help.

09:52.561 --> 09:53.595
Anything, buddy.

09:53.596 --> 09:54.863
What is it?

09:54.864 --> 09:56.598
(sighs)

09:56.599 --> 09:59.967
Which one of these girls
looks the dumbest?

10:01.269 --> 10:02.569
All right, kid.

10:02.570 --> 10:04.938
Let's check
the scouting report.

10:06.540 --> 10:08.708
What about the heater?

10:14.281 --> 10:16.415
High and outside?

10:20.419 --> 10:21.719
All right.

10:21.720 --> 10:24.155
I'd go with the slider.

10:26.726 --> 10:28.126
Thanks, Skip.

10:28.127 --> 10:29.862
Yep.

10:31.866 --> 10:33.667
So, what did he say?

10:33.668 --> 10:35.268
Hmm? Oh!
Yeah, he's going

10:35.269 --> 10:37.438
to take a swat at the
Hamburglar over there.

10:37.439 --> 10:39.140
You were supposed
to talk

10:39.141 --> 10:41.309
to him about
losing his job.

10:41.310 --> 10:42.877
Lily, how is forcing him
to dwell on a problem

10:42.878 --> 10:44.378
he can do nothing about
going to help him?

10:44.379 --> 10:46.847
How is ignoring it going
to solve anything?

10:46.848 --> 10:47.882
Well, you ignored
good dental hygiene

10:47.883 --> 10:49.149
for the better
part of a decade,

10:49.150 --> 10:50.318
and you seem to
be doing just...

10:50.319 --> 10:52.086
Cook Pu! (giggling): Cook Pu.

10:52.087 --> 10:54.622
Dale call yet?
Why do you got to...

10:54.623 --> 10:56.290
Guys, guys, guys, look!

10:58.761 --> 11:00.462
Barney, I'm going to
stop you for a second.

11:00.463 --> 11:02.764
There's something I have to ask.

11:02.765 --> 11:04.332
Have you ever used

11:04.333 --> 11:05.901
performance-enhancing drugs?

11:05.902 --> 11:07.535
No, sir.

11:07.536 --> 11:09.571
I respect the game too much.

11:09.572 --> 11:13.442
Although, I can't say
I haven't been offered.

11:16.613 --> 11:18.714
Dude, it was pretty awesome.

11:19.816 --> 11:20.950
You should try it.

11:20.951 --> 11:22.051
I have, I have some more.

11:22.052 --> 11:23.385
No, thanks.

11:23.386 --> 11:24.887
You sure?

11:24.888 --> 11:27.789
All right, suit yourself.

11:27.790 --> 11:30.192
What time is it?

11:30.193 --> 11:32.060
It's, uh, 8:00.
8:00?

11:39.735 --> 11:41.903
I need to go to the hospital.

11:44.340 --> 11:46.009
I'd never touch the stuff.

11:46.010 --> 11:48.010
You can test me if
you want, Jim Nantz.

11:48.011 --> 11:49.379
Barney, I trust you.

11:49.380 --> 11:51.114
I regret I even asked you
the question.

11:51.115 --> 11:53.282
Okay, let's go to night six.

11:53.283 --> 11:56.152
Two girls away from perfection.

11:56.153 --> 11:58.422
(chattering) Hey! Hey.

11:58.423 --> 12:00.690
Dude, what are you doing here?
Get down to the bar!

12:00.691 --> 12:02.526
Ted, relax.

12:02.527 --> 12:03.627
I'm already six for six.

12:03.628 --> 12:05.295
Really?
Yeah.

12:05.296 --> 12:07.530
I was lunching
at Tavern on the Green,

12:07.531 --> 12:09.933
I started chatting up
this Swedish supermodel.

12:09.934 --> 12:11.467
Next thing you know,
I'm playing a day game

12:11.468 --> 12:13.736
in the back of
a horse-drawn carriage.

12:13.737 --> 12:16.372
Giddy-what-up?!

12:16.373 --> 12:17.940
(neighing)

12:17.941 --> 12:20.143
(splutters and stomps)

12:20.144 --> 12:21.344
Awesome.

12:21.345 --> 12:22.478
What really happened?

12:22.479 --> 12:24.513
I had lunch
at a Staten Island Chili's

12:24.514 --> 12:25.781
and banged a drunk hairdresser.

12:25.782 --> 12:27.216
Are you happy, Truthy McGee?

12:33.523 --> 12:34.723
Barney, we know
you might get fired.

12:34.724 --> 12:37.660
Wait, you have to
talk about this.

12:37.661 --> 12:40.262
You are just using
meaningless sex

12:40.263 --> 12:42.764
to distract yourself from
a really serious issue.

12:42.765 --> 12:44.566
It is not meaningless, okay?

12:44.567 --> 12:47.669
Number five and I
really connected.

12:47.670 --> 12:49.103
She's going back to school.

12:49.104 --> 12:52.974
Or has a kid in school-
something about school!

12:54.543 --> 12:56.577
So, today one of
my students told me

12:56.578 --> 12:58.245
Cook is dropping my class.

12:58.246 --> 13:02.149
Oh, my God, Pu dropped out?

13:02.150 --> 13:04.985
She is flushing her
education down the toilet!

13:04.986 --> 13:06.220
Any word from Dale?

13:06.221 --> 13:08.556
It's only been five days,
he's gonna call!

13:08.557 --> 13:09.790
Why do you care anyway?

13:09.791 --> 13:10.925
You said he was a total dork.

13:10.926 --> 13:12.927
Do not talk
about Dale that way, okay?

13:12.928 --> 13:15.763
He is twice the man
you will ever be!

13:15.764 --> 13:18.866
God forbid, if you can't find
another job, sell your place.

13:18.867 --> 13:20.901
Marshall and I have
an extra room.

13:20.902 --> 13:22.937
You can stay there as
long as you need.

13:22.938 --> 13:25.039
Make sure you bring
your own toothbrush.

13:25.040 --> 13:26.774
Lily, what are you doing?

13:26.775 --> 13:29.477
Talking to my friend who's going
through a really tough time.

13:29.478 --> 13:31.178
He's doing fine.

13:31.179 --> 13:34.014
Trying to sleep with seven
women in seven nights

13:34.015 --> 13:37.450
is not "doing fine"
it's a cry for help.

13:37.451 --> 13:39.151
Barney's whole life
is a cry for help.

13:39.152 --> 13:40.352
But you don't mess with a man

13:40.353 --> 13:41.620
when he's in the middle
of a perf...

13:41.621 --> 13:42.921
What?

13:42.922 --> 13:44.122
Perfect week?

13:44.123 --> 13:45.423
(all gasp)

13:45.424 --> 13:47.492
Oh, perfect week, perfect week,
perfect week!

13:47.493 --> 13:49.461
Grow up!

13:49.462 --> 13:52.030
(hissing)

13:52.031 --> 13:53.365
Unbelievable.

13:53.366 --> 13:55.400
You know, there's two
things you don't do.

13:55.401 --> 13:57.236
One: you don't open an e-mail
from Phil Simms

13:57.237 --> 13:58.637
in front of your kids.

13:58.638 --> 14:02.207
And two: you don't jinx a man
going for a perfect week.

14:02.208 --> 14:03.375
I don't know what to tell you.

14:03.376 --> 14:04.543
Lily's always messing with me.

14:04.544 --> 14:07.045
I think she has a thing
for the Barnacle.

14:07.046 --> 14:09.181
You're a keen observer

14:09.182 --> 14:11.417
of the human condition,
Jim Nantz.

14:12.386 --> 14:14.054
I can't believe
you jinxed him.

14:14.055 --> 14:15.389
He doesn't stand
a chance out there.

14:15.390 --> 14:16.556
LILY:
Okay, question:

14:16.557 --> 14:18.158
If I ruined everything,

14:18.159 --> 14:20.594
why is Barney totally
hitting it off

14:20.595 --> 14:22.663
with Third Martini
Girl over there?

14:22.664 --> 14:25.099
Oh, my God!

14:25.100 --> 14:27.067
He's going to do it!
Yeah. See?

14:27.068 --> 14:29.303
There is no such
thing as a jinx.

14:29.304 --> 14:30.270
(gasps)

14:30.271 --> 14:31.438
Tell me she didn't say,

14:31.439 --> 14:33.240
"There's no such thing
as a jinx."

14:33.241 --> 14:34.307
Wish I could.

14:34.308 --> 14:35.742
You were about to achieve

14:35.743 --> 14:37.110
something so beautiful!

14:37.111 --> 14:38.878
Well, well, thanks to her,

14:38.879 --> 14:41.414
the only thing that could ruin
a surefire hookup

14:41.415 --> 14:43.683
was about to walk
through that door.

14:47.121 --> 14:50.056
<i>A member of the 2009</i>

14:50.057 --> 14:53.493
<i>World Champion
New York Yankees.</i>

15:00.300 --> 15:03.436
Lily, I'm getting
my own toothbrush.

15:07.646 --> 15:09.196
Well, I guess that's it.

15:09.197 --> 15:11.232
Barney's streak
ends at six.

15:11.233 --> 15:12.467
What?! Why?!

15:12.468 --> 15:14.670
Because that guy with the
weird hair just walked in?

15:14.671 --> 15:17.239
That's Nick Swisher.

15:17.240 --> 15:19.475
He's a New York Yankee.

15:19.476 --> 15:22.545
No normal guy in New York City
can compete with a Yankee.

15:22.546 --> 15:24.580
And it doesn't even have
to be a current Yankee.

15:24.581 --> 15:25.715
When I first moved here,

15:25.716 --> 15:28.117
I was on a fourth date
with a girl I really liked,

15:28.118 --> 15:29.485
until I got rack-jacked
by Phil Rizzuto.

15:29.486 --> 15:30.452
I was there.

15:30.453 --> 15:32.254
Holy cow, that guy
had game. Mm-hmm.

15:32.255 --> 15:34.355
I'm not seeing it.

15:34.356 --> 15:36.590
Okay, let me try to Canada
this up for you, eh?

15:36.591 --> 15:37.758
How would you react

15:37.759 --> 15:39.760
if one of those
Ca-chuck guys

15:39.761 --> 15:42.996
with the skates and the
sticks walked in here?

15:42.997 --> 15:46.699
Lily, if one of the Vancouver
Canucks walked in here,

15:46.700 --> 15:48.701
my panties would
drop so hard,

15:48.702 --> 15:50.803
there'd be a hole in the
floor halfway to China.

15:50.804 --> 15:52.238
That's what it's like
with the Yankees.

15:52.239 --> 15:54.274
Well, Barney's screwed.

15:54.275 --> 15:55.776
It's happening! Look.

15:55.777 --> 15:57.110
Hey! Want to come over

15:57.111 --> 15:59.980
and look at my snow
globe collection?

15:59.981 --> 16:01.248
Snow globe collection?

16:01.249 --> 16:03.117
He's throwing junk
out there.

16:05.854 --> 16:07.655
<i>That is Nick Swisher!</i>

16:07.656 --> 16:08.956
(all groan)
Good effort.

16:08.957 --> 16:11.292
Good game, good game, good game,
good game, good game.

16:11.293 --> 16:12.927
Not good enough.

16:12.928 --> 16:16.130
This whole week was a waste.

16:16.999 --> 16:20.868
And tomorrow,
I'm going to get fired.

16:22.370 --> 16:25.005
I'm really sorry, dude.

16:25.006 --> 16:28.041
But for what it's worth,
this week wasn't a waste.

16:28.042 --> 16:31.311
We were all having
a really horrible week

16:31.312 --> 16:33.347
and you took
our minds off it.

16:33.348 --> 16:35.583
Yeah, I had my first student
drop my class- it sucked.

16:35.584 --> 16:37.985
I met my soul mate and
he never called me back.

16:37.986 --> 16:39.854
I mean yet. He will.

16:39.855 --> 16:41.957
(voice breaking):
He will.

16:41.958 --> 16:43.959
We scared off
a really great couple

16:43.960 --> 16:45.861
just because we share
a toothbrush.

16:45.862 --> 16:48.297
You share a toothbrush?!

16:48.298 --> 16:50.065
Well, them and Ted.

16:50.066 --> 16:50.865
Wha...?

16:50.866 --> 16:52.367
Wait a second.

16:52.368 --> 16:55.504
When we were dating, you borrowed
that toothbrush all the time.

16:55.505 --> 16:57.372
Oh, my God.

16:57.373 --> 16:59.141
<i>NARRATOR: And that's
when Aunt Lily realized</i>

16:59.142 --> 17:00.676
<i>what's great about sports:</i>

17:00.677 --> 17:03.845
<i>They take your mind off your
troubles, if only for a moment.</i>

17:03.846 --> 17:07.482
<i>And deep down, we all needed
that perfect week.</i>

17:08.751 --> 17:12.319
The second she sits down next
to Swisher, it's all over.

17:14.656 --> 17:16.490
Wait a minute!

17:16.491 --> 17:18.893
MARSHALL:
Aldrin's got a bead on her!

17:22.598 --> 17:24.633
She's running
out of room.

17:24.634 --> 17:27.035
She dives, and...

17:27.036 --> 17:28.203
(thud)

17:28.204 --> 17:30.106
I have no idea where
she's going with this.

17:30.107 --> 17:32.074
Oh, my God, are-are
you okay? Yeah. Oh.

17:32.075 --> 17:34.077
Sorry. I'm such a klutz!

17:34.078 --> 17:35.479
Oh, thanks. Ow!

17:35.480 --> 17:36.513
Oh, I...

17:36.514 --> 17:37.881
think I twisted my ankle.

17:37.882 --> 17:39.183
Can you get me some ice?

17:39.184 --> 17:40.017
Of course.

17:40.018 --> 17:41.652
Oh, my God,
she did it!

17:41.653 --> 17:45.089
I guess- I guess there is
no such thing as a jinx!

17:50.028 --> 17:52.363
Oh, I'll get you
some ice, Lily.

17:52.364 --> 17:54.365
MARSHALL:
Damn it.

17:54.366 --> 17:55.466
Swisher's back
in play!

17:55.467 --> 17:56.567
Swisher's back in play!

17:56.568 --> 17:57.635
Follow me.

17:57.636 --> 17:59.470
Hey, Nick Swisher!

17:59.471 --> 18:01.538
This guy and his wife
share a toothbrush!

18:01.539 --> 18:02.806
So?

18:02.807 --> 18:05.809
So, that's weird, right?

18:05.810 --> 18:08.578
Actually, I think
it's kind of sweet.

18:08.579 --> 18:11.781
In a way, aren't we all trying
to find that special someone

18:11.782 --> 18:13.849
to share a toothbrush with?

18:13.850 --> 18:15.718
Excuse me.

18:15.719 --> 18:17.586
Lily, Nick Swisher
thinks we're sweet.

18:18.688 --> 18:21.090
Martini?

18:21.091 --> 18:23.425
We're having a beer
with a New York Yankee.

18:23.426 --> 18:24.927
How cool is that?

18:24.928 --> 18:25.961
It's amazing.

18:25.962 --> 18:27.762
I totally follow baseball.

18:27.763 --> 18:30.065
Mookie Wilson, is that a thing?

18:30.066 --> 18:32.033
Yeah, baseball, it's amazing.

18:32.034 --> 18:34.636
But I tell you one thing,
it's no hockey.

18:34.637 --> 18:39.440
I live right upstairs.

18:39.441 --> 18:42.009
What do you say we go back
to my place?

18:42.010 --> 18:43.244
(sultry laughter)

18:43.245 --> 18:46.447
Wow, to be honest,
I don't normally do that,

18:46.448 --> 18:49.349
but I feel a real
connection here,

18:49.350 --> 18:51.084
seven- Christy.

18:54.956 --> 18:57.123
Please.

18:58.592 --> 19:00.626
I did it!

19:00.627 --> 19:02.528
(all cheering)

19:02.529 --> 19:03.529
I did...

19:03.530 --> 19:05.731
(laughing)

19:08.101 --> 19:10.035
Amazing!

19:10.036 --> 19:12.504
Congratulations on
your perfect week!

19:12.505 --> 19:13.704
Thanks, Jim.

19:13.705 --> 19:15.373
I couldn't have done it
without my teammates.

19:15.374 --> 19:16.707
Hey, on to a new topic.

19:16.708 --> 19:19.509
Do you really think
you might get fired today?

19:19.510 --> 19:22.445
Um, uh, Jim,

19:22.446 --> 19:24.547
I- I-I told you I don't want
to talk about that.

19:24.548 --> 19:27.616
Barney, I'm a figment
of your imagination,

19:27.617 --> 19:29.619
so apparently you do.

19:29.620 --> 19:31.321
Think about that.

19:32.123 --> 19:35.458
What a jerk.
You're a jerk.

19:37.962 --> 19:40.730
Mr. Donovan will
see you now.

19:40.731 --> 19:44.867
Stinson, we've reached
a decision.

19:46.570 --> 19:48.838
We're keeping you on.

19:48.839 --> 19:50.673
(sighs)

19:50.674 --> 19:53.309
I know this past week
must have been tough on you.

19:53.310 --> 19:54.677
(chuckles)

19:54.678 --> 19:57.412
I barely slept.

19:57.413 --> 19:58.513
Here you go, guys.

19:58.514 --> 20:01.750
The official hat
of Barney's perfect week.

20:01.751 --> 20:02.918
I was going to
do shirts,

20:02.919 --> 20:04.753
but then you have
to guess sizes.

20:04.754 --> 20:06.621
And feelings get hurt.
It's a mess.

20:06.622 --> 20:08.156
In commemoration

20:08.157 --> 20:12.693
of Barney's induction into
the Hall of Game, this tie,

20:12.694 --> 20:15.061
worn on the seventh night
of his perfect week,

20:15.062 --> 20:17.030
is hereby retired.

20:17.031 --> 20:19.799
May Barney's heroic
feat be remembered

20:19.800 --> 20:22.401
and spoken of
for generations to come.

20:23.436 --> 20:25.837
I'm totally going
to sit my kids down one day

20:25.838 --> 20:27.539
and tell them about
the time Uncle Barney

20:27.540 --> 20:29.374
nailed seven chicks in a row.

20:29.375 --> 20:31.042
(all laugh)

20:31.043 --> 20:34.345
<i>NARRATOR:
Am I a bad dad?</i>

20:36.283 --> 20:37.817
Take out order for Cook Pu?

20:37.818 --> 20:40.887
We have a number two
over here for Cook Pu.

20:40.888 --> 20:43.356
You guys got Wendy
saying it now?!

20:43.357 --> 20:45.225
Come on, I- Okay, I get it.

20:45.226 --> 20:47.161
Cook Pu is a stupid name

20:47.162 --> 20:49.530
and it gets stupider and
stupider the more you say it.

20:49.531 --> 20:52.033
Cook Pu. Cook Pu. Cook Pu.

20:52.034 --> 20:53.601
Here.
