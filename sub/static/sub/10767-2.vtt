00:02.253 --> 00:04.209
<i>On the last Fresh Prince of Bel-Air:</i>

00:04.453 --> 00:07.809
I cannot believe that you and Carlton
are moving into your own place.

00:08.413 --> 00:10.085
Sorry, Dad, I have to go.

00:10.293 --> 00:12.363
- No, you don't.
- Will says I do.

00:12.573 --> 00:15.565
He says it's time for me to leave
the nest, become independent...

00:15.733 --> 00:17.769
...and have sex with girls.

00:19.413 --> 00:22.962
Okay, everybody, guess what.

00:25.413 --> 00:27.563
I'm getting married.

00:27.773 --> 00:29.968
Will, I've met the woman
of my dreams.

00:30.533 --> 00:32.967
Oh, my God. Will.

00:36.573 --> 00:39.371
No, no, no!

01:52.653 --> 01:55.486
- Baby!
- Oh, man.

01:56.653 --> 01:58.769
Girl, look at you.

02:02.413 --> 02:04.369
That's for not calling me
after you left.

02:04.533 --> 02:07.570
Well, I called you twice times.
The line was busy.

02:07.853 --> 02:09.729
Will, you have not changed,
have you?

02:10.613 --> 02:13.525
Carlton, I'll see you later.

02:18.093 --> 02:21.563
Since I didn't buy a program
on the way in...

02:23.333 --> 02:26.564
...could you please tell me
what the heck is going on?

02:26.933 --> 02:29.925
Man, look, that filly is from Philly.
We grew up together.

02:30.133 --> 02:31.930
What does that mean,
"grew up together"?

02:32.093 --> 02:33.890
What do you want it to mean?

02:34.053 --> 02:36.487
That she hates you
and you have no interest in her.

02:36.853 --> 02:38.491
You saw her smack me, didn't you?

02:38.653 --> 02:40.564
I've seen a lot of girls
smack you, Will.

02:40.733 --> 02:43.566
Then I see the same girls
leaving your room.

02:44.693 --> 02:48.606
Yeah, well,
Jackie is not like most girls.

02:49.133 --> 02:51.089
She's special.

02:54.613 --> 02:56.331
Look at her.

02:56.933 --> 02:59.401
Yo, man, she used to be able
to beat every brother...

02:59.573 --> 03:01.689
...on the playground in a foot race.

03:03.093 --> 03:07.450
I'll fight you for her, Will.
Any time, any place.

03:10.293 --> 03:13.365
Relax. I got about as much chance
with Jackie as you do.

03:15.693 --> 03:18.890
Hey, Carlton. Did Mr. Gorodetsky
say anything about this building...

03:19.053 --> 03:20.645
...being a landmark or something?

03:21.093 --> 03:22.811
No, why?

03:23.093 --> 03:25.653
Because there's a tour bus
pulling up on the front lawn.

03:27.173 --> 03:30.563
<i>All right, y'all, everybody
in rows one through 15...</i>

03:30.733 --> 03:32.724
<i>... the party's in apartment 206.</i>

03:34.893 --> 03:37.009
- Jazz!
- Jazz!

03:42.373 --> 03:44.933
<i>Everybody in rows 16 through 30.</i>

03:51.053 --> 03:53.044
<i>And have money in your hands.</i>

03:53.213 --> 03:56.842
<i>Senior citizens get
a 10-percent discount.</i>

03:57.253 --> 03:59.528
<i>I do take tips.</i>

04:01.173 --> 04:02.572
So, Will...

04:02.733 --> 04:05.327
...what's on tap for tomorrow?

04:07.973 --> 04:10.726
Daddy, how about
a November wedding?

04:10.893 --> 04:15.250
Nothing extravagant, just 800
of our closest friends and relatives.

04:15.453 --> 04:16.966
Or maybe we could book the Forum.

04:17.132 --> 04:19.930
I'm sure the Lakers
will be on the road by then.

04:20.813 --> 04:23.691
Daddy, is something wrong?

04:24.453 --> 04:27.763
I'm sorry, sweetheart. It's...
This wedding took me by surprise.

04:27.933 --> 04:31.369
I didn't count on losing you
and Carlton on the same day.

04:31.853 --> 04:33.650
Oh, Daddy.

04:33.853 --> 04:36.413
You're not losing me.

04:36.573 --> 04:37.801
You promise?

04:37.973 --> 04:40.282
Look, even though
I'm getting married...

04:40.453 --> 04:43.172
...you'll always be my daddy.

04:45.253 --> 04:48.245
And you'll always be my little girl.

04:51.173 --> 04:54.245
I'm also Trevor's little girl.

04:56.853 --> 04:58.081
No, no, no.

04:58.253 --> 05:02.007
Technically, you're his woman,
not his little girl.

05:02.173 --> 05:05.165
Then why does he make me wear
those outfits?

05:06.893 --> 05:08.884
Excuse me.

05:09.853 --> 05:12.367
I'm scheduled for a heart attack.

05:16.253 --> 05:18.323
Go away. Ain't no party.

05:18.573 --> 05:21.292
Open up, it's Mr. Gorodetsky.

05:21.813 --> 05:23.849
Just a second, I'm undressed.

05:24.533 --> 05:28.890
- Carlton, Carlton, wake up.
- Look out, Jerry. Tom's gonna get you.

05:35.013 --> 05:36.366
Wake up, it's the landlord.

05:36.533 --> 05:38.922
We gotta put the furniture back.
Come on.

05:39.653 --> 05:41.450
Open up!

05:44.253 --> 05:46.448
Open up here!

05:51.133 --> 05:54.330
This used to be my lawn.
And this used to be my banister.

05:54.533 --> 05:57.172
- And you used to be my tenants.
- But... But...

05:57.373 --> 05:59.807
I want you out of here by noon.

05:59.973 --> 06:02.328
- But...
- Noon!

06:05.373 --> 06:07.568
He kicked your butt.

06:08.253 --> 06:11.051
Excuse me, that's our butts, Carlton.
We're in this together.

06:11.213 --> 06:12.692
Not anymore, Kemosabe.

06:12.853 --> 06:15.083
I'm going back to my family,
where I belong.

06:15.253 --> 06:17.369
- No, you are not.
- Oh, yeah? Why?

06:17.533 --> 06:20.491
Because that will be like admitting
we can't make it on our own.

06:20.653 --> 06:23.531
I don't have to make it on my own.
I'm rich.

06:25.573 --> 06:27.689
I never wanted
to move out in the first place.

06:27.853 --> 06:30.731
Thanks to you, I've had
my heart broken and I've been evicted.

06:31.093 --> 06:33.561
If this is your idea of independence,
you can have it.

06:35.173 --> 06:36.731
I can be reached by fax.

06:37.973 --> 06:41.170
Carlton. Carlton, come on, man.
I can't make rent without you.

06:42.013 --> 06:44.243
Then come home, Will.

06:45.413 --> 06:47.005
I'll send Geoffrey for my things.

06:51.693 --> 06:55.527
Then go ahead home, you damn baby.

06:57.293 --> 07:00.251
You'll probably be there
till you're in your 30s anyway.

07:00.413 --> 07:03.405
Like all those other serial killers.

07:11.373 --> 07:14.763
This is Jazz's mother.

07:14.973 --> 07:17.885
He's not here.

07:18.213 --> 07:22.331
This is Publishers Clearinghouse.
You've already won.

07:22.493 --> 07:24.563
It's about time.

07:27.173 --> 07:29.368
Open the door. Open the door.

07:29.573 --> 07:31.370
Will, I'm so glad it's you.

07:31.573 --> 07:35.248
I heard somebody disguised as me
ran a party scam.

07:35.853 --> 07:38.048
Jazz, you got me kicked out
my crib, man.

07:38.733 --> 07:40.883
Let me make it up to you.

07:42.093 --> 07:44.402
Talk fast, you've only got
a few minutes to live.

07:44.613 --> 07:47.525
- You can stay here with me.
- In this roach motel?

07:47.693 --> 07:51.572
It would only be temporary.
I'm getting thrown out on the 15th.

07:53.413 --> 07:54.732
Jazz...

07:54.893 --> 07:56.326
...give me the money.

07:57.013 --> 07:59.004
Money? What money?

07:59.213 --> 08:01.602
The 25 dollars a head
you charged for my party.

08:02.293 --> 08:05.922
Man, I was sneaking the bus
back to the depot and I got held up.

08:06.093 --> 08:09.290
White dude. He took the bus too.

08:12.453 --> 08:13.852
The money's gone, isn't it?

08:14.373 --> 08:16.091
Like the Jheri curl.

08:19.013 --> 08:20.605
Here you go, roomie.

08:20.813 --> 08:24.044
Get comfy. You're gonna love it here.

08:25.013 --> 08:28.244
That's the Wilsons.
You'll get to know them.

08:30.853 --> 08:32.172
I hate you, Jazz.

08:32.813 --> 08:34.485
I know you don't mean that.

09:07.333 --> 09:09.528
"Roommate wanted.
Minutes from school.

09:09.693 --> 09:11.968
Must love ice hockey,
country-and-western music...

09:12.133 --> 09:14.886
...and Tom Cruise movies."
This is worse than Jazz's.

09:16.773 --> 09:18.889
Whoa, wait, back up, girl.
Wax on, wax off.

09:21.133 --> 09:25.126
I'm sorry I had to clock you last night,
but you know me and my temper.

09:28.813 --> 09:31.486
No, you know, I understand.

09:31.653 --> 09:34.247
That torch you've been
carrying for me all these years...

09:34.413 --> 09:37.849
...suddenly got a little
too hot to handle.

09:38.493 --> 09:41.007
We were friends, Will. Nothing more.

09:43.013 --> 09:46.528
We were more than friends that night
after Alonzo Simmons' party.

09:47.373 --> 09:49.250
I was young and immature then.

09:49.413 --> 09:52.086
I guess you still are, Lobe.

09:52.253 --> 09:54.721
Hey, hey, hey,
don't you be calling me Lobe.

09:54.973 --> 09:57.931
I left that in Philly,
where I thought I left you.

10:00.133 --> 10:02.124
What are you doing out here anyway?

10:02.293 --> 10:04.011
Remember that jump shot
you taught me?

10:04.173 --> 10:07.449
Well, I parlayed that
into a basketball scholarship.

10:08.333 --> 10:10.563
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold up.

10:10.773 --> 10:14.322
You mean they're giving
basketball scholarships to girls now?

10:14.493 --> 10:15.812
Lmagine my surprise.

10:16.053 --> 10:19.728
There I was just churning butter,
and the phone rings.

10:34.893 --> 10:39.091
So you and Carlton tight?

10:39.493 --> 10:41.131
He is.

10:42.333 --> 10:44.688
We're cousins.
I've been staying with his family.

10:44.853 --> 10:47.606
- In Bel-Air?
- Yeah, so?

10:47.813 --> 10:51.249
- So beware of the bougieman.
- Hold on, hold on, hold on.

10:51.413 --> 10:54.246
I kept in touch
with everybody from the hood.

10:54.933 --> 10:56.844
Everybody but me.

10:57.613 --> 10:58.887
Why?

10:59.973 --> 11:01.486
Why?

11:02.373 --> 11:06.127
Yeah. Why would you keep in touch
with everybody but me?

11:13.373 --> 11:16.649
I see this really bothers you.
I'm gonna give you a couple of minutes.

11:16.813 --> 11:19.281
Damn you, Will.
Just answer the question.

11:19.493 --> 11:20.812
Why didn't you call me?

11:22.333 --> 11:24.244
Because I missed you too much.
How's that?

11:24.413 --> 11:26.369
I said it. Happy?
That what you wanna hear?

11:26.533 --> 11:30.890
Hey, y'all, I missed the hell out of her.
I missed her. I missed her.

11:31.053 --> 11:32.884
I said it.
That's what you wanted, right?

11:33.053 --> 11:35.886
Everybody know I missed her.

11:39.133 --> 11:40.646
Look, I gotta get up out of here.

11:40.813 --> 11:42.929
Gotta go find me
an apartment and a job.

11:43.093 --> 11:45.163
Don't hit your head on the rim.

11:47.813 --> 11:50.452
One of my people quit this morning.

11:53.813 --> 11:57.806
I'm sorry.
Are you suggesting maybe you...

12:00.213 --> 12:04.650
...and me working together
side by side?

12:05.413 --> 12:07.404
No, it's too tempting.

12:07.813 --> 12:10.771
Before long, you'd be dragging me down
into the storeroom...

12:10.933 --> 12:13.731
...and snatching all my gear off
and everything.

12:13.893 --> 12:16.453
Then I have to nail you
with a sexual-harassment suit...

12:16.613 --> 12:19.730
...like the Anita Hill thing in reverse.
It's too much now.

12:21.893 --> 12:25.852
Look, maybe your transmission's stuck
in junior high or something...

12:26.053 --> 12:27.247
...but mine's not.

12:27.413 --> 12:30.610
I busted my butt to get where I am,
and I'm not about to lose focus...

12:30.773 --> 12:32.650
...just because you're back in my life.

12:38.453 --> 12:40.648
Now, I got me an agenda too.

12:41.213 --> 12:44.808
And it certainly does not include
risking frostbite around you.

12:44.973 --> 12:48.283
- Fine.
- Well, good then.

12:54.413 --> 12:56.483
When do I start?

12:58.173 --> 12:59.606
Next week, when school starts.

12:59.813 --> 13:02.532
I will be here.

13:04.973 --> 13:06.406
Oh, Will.

13:06.893 --> 13:08.326
Wear something warm.

13:15.693 --> 13:19.083
Yo, man, I didn't really miss her.
That was just game I was kicking there.

13:19.253 --> 13:21.130
You know,
that's how you gotta do it.

13:34.453 --> 13:36.728
Hey, man.

13:37.693 --> 13:40.412
Hey, man. I was, man...

13:40.573 --> 13:42.325
I was... I was coming... Coming back...

13:42.493 --> 13:45.246
I was getting the rest of my stuff.

13:45.573 --> 13:48.531
Well, why don't you take
some food too. We have plenty.

13:49.093 --> 13:50.446
Well, if it's gonna spoil.

13:52.373 --> 13:56.651
So things aren't going quite as smoothly
as you planned, are they, son?

13:56.853 --> 13:59.447
Hey, hold up. Not only
do I got me a new place to stay...

13:59.613 --> 14:01.490
...I got me a job on campus.

14:01.653 --> 14:03.211
Adversity is my oyster.

14:05.093 --> 14:07.653
This will go good with my adversity.

14:10.333 --> 14:12.528
Why don't you come home, Will?

14:13.893 --> 14:15.406
No, I can't, Uncle Phil, man.

14:16.053 --> 14:19.125
Don't get me wrong. I appreciate you
taking me in and everything...

14:19.293 --> 14:21.682
...but I just feel like
I'm at a point in my life...

14:21.853 --> 14:23.764
...where I need to have
my own space.

14:25.453 --> 14:28.445
Trevor's about to propose.
Where's Carlton?

14:28.653 --> 14:31.690
The last I saw him,
he was in his room kissing the floor.

14:32.253 --> 14:36.292
Will, I just want you to know
that the door is always open for you.

14:36.453 --> 14:38.205
Thanks a lot, Uncle Phil.

14:38.373 --> 14:40.011
There's no place like home.

14:40.173 --> 14:42.289
There's no place like home.

14:42.453 --> 14:44.762
There's no place like home.

14:45.093 --> 14:46.367
Turn it up.

14:46.533 --> 14:47.852
Oh, there's Trevor.

14:48.533 --> 14:49.966
It's a bungee jump.

14:50.893 --> 14:55.683
I asked him to propose in a special way,
but I never expected a bungee jump.

14:55.893 --> 14:58.088
What's a bungee jump?

14:59.133 --> 15:00.725
Well, Hil, he's gonna propose...

15:00.893 --> 15:04.329
...while falling 300 feet
on a giant rubber band.

15:04.493 --> 15:06.688
Isn't it romantic?

15:07.013 --> 15:09.527
Please, whatever happened
to getting down on one knee?

15:09.733 --> 15:12.406
- Daddy, that's for old fogies.
- I got down on one knee.

15:12.813 --> 15:14.804
Sustained.

15:17.533 --> 15:19.683
Look, there he goes.

15:20.653 --> 15:22.609
<i>Hilary Banks...</i>

15:22.813 --> 15:24.769
Yes, Trevor?

15:24.933 --> 15:28.642
<i>Will you marry me...?</i>

15:51.493 --> 15:55.122
I ain't no bungee expert or nothing...

15:55.293 --> 15:59.286
...but I don't think he's supposed
to be slamming into the ground like that.

16:02.173 --> 16:03.845
"Please stand by"?

16:04.013 --> 16:07.608
Great. The president's
about to interrupt my marriage proposal.

16:09.133 --> 16:12.205
Let's just pray that Trevor's okay.

16:12.693 --> 16:15.332
Well, that was a lovely service.

16:16.733 --> 16:20.328
Trevor didn't look so bad for a dude
that had a concrete face-lift.

16:20.493 --> 16:23.883
Fool. Like that was his real head.

16:24.853 --> 16:26.889
Could you two
show a little compassion?

16:27.053 --> 16:29.248
Your sister's right behind you.

16:32.333 --> 16:34.801
I still can't understand.

16:35.013 --> 16:38.528
Sweetheart, the Lord giveth
and the Lord taketh away.

16:38.733 --> 16:41.691
No, I mean technically.
Am I a widow or what?

16:43.733 --> 16:45.212
This is all my fault.

16:45.373 --> 16:47.603
If I hadn't asked
for a special proposal...

16:47.773 --> 16:49.843
...Trevor would be in my arms...

16:50.013 --> 16:53.085
...instead of in my purse.

16:56.213 --> 16:58.204
I love you, Trevor.

17:02.053 --> 17:03.725
Hilary...

17:04.012 --> 17:06.446
...Trevor wasn't cremated.

17:09.893 --> 17:12.042
Then who's this?

17:15.693 --> 17:18.924
I'll see him to the door, Miss Hilary.

17:20.292 --> 17:22.682
Sweetheart...

17:23.133 --> 17:26.364
Now is the time when you should
make use of Reverend Boyd.

17:26.532 --> 17:28.444
Is he single?

17:28.973 --> 17:33.285
I mean you should be spiritual.
After all, Trevor's in heaven now.

17:33.493 --> 17:37.281
Right. He's up there
with my little dog Scruffy.

17:38.413 --> 17:41.166
Yeah, and the bus he rode in under.

17:41.973 --> 17:43.884
Must everything be a joke to you?

17:44.053 --> 17:47.648
My sister's in a fragile condition.
I'm trying to help her bounce back.

17:48.493 --> 17:50.165
Bounce.

17:50.893 --> 17:53.168
Trevor bounced.

17:53.853 --> 17:57.050
Son, go get yourself a milk.

17:58.133 --> 18:00.727
If you go right back to work
as soon as possible...

18:00.893 --> 18:03.282
...maybe it would help you
get your mind off things.

18:04.053 --> 18:08.649
Work? Every inch of that newsroom
reminds me of Trevor.

18:08.813 --> 18:12.522
His desk, his makeup bib...

18:12.693 --> 18:14.604
...the shower in his office.

18:18.453 --> 18:23.368
I just need some time
to find some sense of inner peace.

18:23.573 --> 18:25.529
After all...

18:25.813 --> 18:27.883
...I am alone now.

18:28.053 --> 18:32.126
Oh, no, sweetheart. You have me.

18:32.333 --> 18:34.051
Look, in a few days...

18:34.213 --> 18:37.125
...why don't I take you to the mall
and we can go shopping.

18:37.293 --> 18:39.887
Go to the mall with my father?

18:40.053 --> 18:41.964
Sorry, I forgot.

18:44.013 --> 18:45.969
Must you do that?

18:52.213 --> 18:55.603
I hate to be the bearer
of more bad news, but...

18:55.773 --> 18:57.206
Greetings, mourners.

18:58.693 --> 19:00.206
Hilary.

19:00.413 --> 19:02.802
If there's anything we can learn
from this tragedy...

19:02.973 --> 19:05.009
...that's to live each day
to the fullest.

19:06.413 --> 19:07.766
I know, Jazz.

19:08.293 --> 19:10.682
So with that in mind,
what are you doing later?

19:10.893 --> 19:12.167
Oh, my...

19:13.533 --> 19:16.206
- It's all right.
- Guess y'all need to be alone right now.

19:16.613 --> 19:19.889
Yeah, so do you, Jazz.
I'll meet you back at the palace later.

19:20.053 --> 19:23.489
Oh, yeah, I forgot. There's a hostage
situation back at my building.

19:23.653 --> 19:26.292
SWAT team said it'd be a week
before we could get back in.

19:27.013 --> 19:28.492
Jazz...

19:34.533 --> 19:37.047
Forgive me for what I'm about to do.

19:38.133 --> 19:40.601
Hilary, can I have a word with you?

19:41.973 --> 19:44.203
Look, you know,
I think you got the right idea...

19:44.413 --> 19:47.211
...not going back to, you know,
work so soon.

19:47.413 --> 19:52.043
You're just lucky that there's nothing
around here that reminds you of Trevor.

19:52.453 --> 19:55.092
Of course, there is the pool house.

19:55.253 --> 19:57.403
Never mind,
forget about that, though.

19:58.053 --> 20:00.726
Then, on the other hand...

20:00.893 --> 20:05.921
...that is where you and he
shared countless romantic evenings.

20:06.333 --> 20:08.927
I bet if those walls could talk...

20:09.093 --> 20:10.811
...they'd whisper:

20:11.333 --> 20:12.812
"Trevor."

20:17.853 --> 20:19.491
"Trevor."

20:21.693 --> 20:25.481
Daddy, I can't stay in the pool house.
I'm moving back in here.

20:25.653 --> 20:28.884
Of course, sweetheart, whatever
will make you more comfortable.

20:29.053 --> 20:32.250
I don't know what I would do
without my family.

20:32.453 --> 20:34.171
Mother.

20:34.333 --> 20:35.686
Ashley.

20:35.893 --> 20:38.361
Can you get my things
from the pool house?

20:39.013 --> 20:40.969
Of course. Come on, Ashley.

20:41.133 --> 20:43.488
- Say, Uncle Phil, man.
- Hey, you know what, Will?

20:43.653 --> 20:47.248
I was thinking maybe I could turn
that pool house into a law library.

20:47.893 --> 20:51.124
- Stop playing, listen.
- No, no, well...

20:51.453 --> 20:53.444
A greenhouse. That would work, huh?

20:53.653 --> 20:54.972
I said, stop playing, listen.

20:55.133 --> 20:57.363
- I was wondering...
- You can have the pool house.

20:57.533 --> 20:59.728
- All right.
- At the same rent Hilary was paying.

20:59.893 --> 21:03.568
- And I have a few rules.
- That's cool, because I got demands.

21:04.933 --> 21:07.128
- No loud music after 11.
- Twelve.

21:07.293 --> 21:08.521
- Eleven-thirty.
- Cool.

21:08.693 --> 21:11.082
Check it out.
It's important that I have my privacy.

21:11.253 --> 21:14.928
Say a honey be tiptoeing up my crib.
That's my business, not yours.

21:15.093 --> 21:18.972
- Fine. No skinny-dipping.
- You gotta promise me that same thing.

21:24.853 --> 21:26.286
Done.

21:26.933 --> 21:29.493
Well, son, I guess
you got yourself a pool house.

21:29.653 --> 21:31.211
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on.

21:31.373 --> 21:32.965
How come he gets the pool house...

21:33.133 --> 21:35.408
...and I'm stuck upstairs
with the grieving widow?

21:37.653 --> 21:41.805
Another thing. Keep this person
off my property or I'll shoot him.

21:42.653 --> 21:43.881
It's my property.

21:44.053 --> 21:47.523
I'm gonna inherit it
after the big guy takes his bungee jump.

21:48.133 --> 21:50.010
Right, big guy?

21:52.493 --> 21:55.371
Well, he does have a point.

21:55.533 --> 21:58.001
I'll tell you what,
why don't you two work it out.

21:58.773 --> 22:01.207
Okay, tallest one gets the bedroom.

22:01.373 --> 22:04.331
I need the big closet
for my peacock suit.

22:04.853 --> 22:07.572
So nice to have my family back.

22:08.373 --> 22:10.409
- You shut up, man.
- Look, you shut up.

22:10.613 --> 22:14.003
And wipe that
damn milk mustache off.

22:19.573 --> 22:21.564
Open the door. Open the door.

22:21.733 --> 22:23.849
Will! So glad it's you.

22:24.053 --> 22:28.251
I heard someone disguised as me
just ran a party scam.

22:29.693 --> 22:31.092
I'm sorry, what?

22:33.173 --> 22:36.051
How many people think
we doing that again?

22:40.373 --> 22:43.570
Some... Somebody started...
Party scam.

22:44.305 --> 22:50.710
