00:01.586 --> 00:03.076
NATHAN: Previously on Heroes.

00:03.254 --> 00:05.290
Lauren, it's great
to see you.

00:05.381 --> 00:06.541
Dinner's ready,
everyone.

00:06.632 --> 00:08.293
You brought a date?
No.

00:08.384 --> 00:09.464
SANDRA: How did
the two of you meet?

00:09.552 --> 00:11.759
Lauren and |
used to work together
at Primatech.

00:11.846 --> 00:13.928
She is so a date.

00:14.640 --> 00:16.551
I'm dead. He knows it,
you know it.

00:16.642 --> 00:17.722
Why don't you tell us why?

00:17.810 --> 00:21.018
As far as
the world is concerned,
Nathan is still alive.

00:21.105 --> 00:22.060
Yeah, but I'm not me.

00:22.148 --> 00:23.809
They are your memories.

00:23.900 --> 00:27.438
His spirit and his mind
are fighting for his family.

00:27.528 --> 00:30.565
Look, I'm gonna find him,
and I'm gonna
bring him back, Mom.

00:30.656 --> 00:32.521
It's over.

00:32.617 --> 00:34.027
It isn't possible anymore.

00:34.118 --> 00:35.153
I'll find a way.

00:35.703 --> 00:38.365
Maybe I'm just not supposed
to have a normal life.

00:38.456 --> 00:40.037
Sounds like you're giving up.

00:40.124 --> 00:41.785
I wanna find out
where this leads.

00:41.876 --> 00:42.865
Where did you get that?

00:42.960 --> 00:44.496
I stole it from my dad.

00:44.962 --> 00:45.951
You need to take me back.

00:46.047 --> 00:47.162
I need to
know the truth.

00:47.256 --> 00:49.713
Your brother's powers
could increase
a thousandfold.

00:49.800 --> 00:52.007
JOSEPH: And it's been
my life's work
to keep him in the dark.

00:52.094 --> 00:53.800
SAMUEL: (SHOUTING)
How long have you
been lying to me, huh?

00:53.888 --> 00:57.426
You had to be controlled.
You have the power
to kill millions.

00:57.516 --> 00:58.847
You betrayed me.

01:18.412 --> 01:20.528
I know the truth, Samuel.

01:24.001 --> 01:26.208
But I have a daughter
to look after.

01:26.295 --> 01:28.456
So your secret
is safe with me.

01:35.137 --> 01:37.469
You wanted to
see me, Samuel?

01:37.556 --> 01:38.932
I don't know why
I bother reading these.

01:39.016 --> 01:42.634
Nothing but
god-awful news
everywhere.

01:44.981 --> 01:46.846
Makes one wonder,
doesn't it?

01:47.191 --> 01:48.180
About what?

01:48.276 --> 01:50.437
The nature of
our |ow|y existence.

01:50.736 --> 01:52.852
People want to believe
there's hope everywhere,

01:52.947 --> 01:54.903
but then you read this.

01:54.991 --> 01:58.404
Makes you wonder if we're
not destined to be the last
generation of our species.

01:58.494 --> 02:01.907
And if that's so,
how can we stop that
from happening?

02:01.998 --> 02:04.614
I don't really give it
much thought.

02:05.042 --> 02:07.158
Well, you really should.

02:07.253 --> 02:11.212
You grew up in this family.
Been a loyal and trusted
member your whole life.

02:11.299 --> 02:12.709
That's why I want
to ask a favor.

02:12.800 --> 02:17.294
With Edgar gone, will you
do me the honor of
being my right-hand man?

02:19.640 --> 02:21.380
Or should I say "men"?

02:21.475 --> 02:22.851
The honor would be all mine.

02:22.935 --> 02:25.677
Good. 'Cause I need you
to start by
retrieving some files

02:25.771 --> 02:28.228
from the apartment
of a Mr. Noah Bennet.

02:28.733 --> 02:31.816
They'll be in a box
marked Primatech.

02:33.821 --> 02:35.937
Who should I give this to?

02:41.454 --> 02:43.661
Do | get to use
my friends?

02:48.711 --> 02:52.454
I think they will
lend themselves
very nicely to the job.

03:33.381 --> 03:34.917
(KNOCK AT DOOR)

03:47.311 --> 03:48.847
Evening, Mr. Bennet.

03:48.938 --> 03:50.269
Hello, Miss Gilmore.

03:52.274 --> 03:53.730
Come on in.

03:56.278 --> 04:00.396
You know, I easily
could have picked you up.

04:00.491 --> 04:02.277
You do live closer
to the theater.

04:02.368 --> 04:05.576
| asked you out.
Seems only fair
I pick you up.

04:06.831 --> 04:08.071
Are you uncomfortable
with that?

04:08.165 --> 04:11.077
No,no,no.
Notatau
ltsjust”

04:12.169 --> 04:14.000
It's been a longtime
since I've dated.

04:14.088 --> 04:18.252
You know, I've kind of
skipped right over
the sexual revolution.

04:18.467 --> 04:20.708
Who said anything
aboutsex?

04:24.348 --> 04:26.760
What's all that?

04:27.893 --> 04:28.882
Oh.

04:29.186 --> 04:31.438
That's the bad guys.
I think, I don't know.

04:31.522 --> 04:35.014
It's been harder
to wrangle resources
since Primatech folded.

04:35.109 --> 04:36.315
LAUREN: Compass?
That seems to be

04:36.402 --> 04:39.394
the key component
in the mystery.
Enough for them to kill for.

04:39.488 --> 04:42.776
I've come across
two of them.
Here, have a look.

04:45.703 --> 04:46.692
It was right here.

04:46.787 --> 04:48.527
Maybe you put it
someplace else.

04:48.622 --> 04:49.611
No.

04:50.916 --> 04:52.031
Claire.

04:52.835 --> 04:53.790
She took it?

04:53.878 --> 04:56.620
When she was here
last night. Damn it!

04:59.258 --> 05:00.623
Voice mail.

05:00.718 --> 05:03.835
Claire. It's me. I know
you took the compass.

05:03.929 --> 05:07.137
Whatever you're doing
right now,
please, just stop.

05:07.224 --> 05:10.091
This is much more dangerous
than you know.

05:10.686 --> 05:12.472
Call me right away.

05:13.564 --> 05:17.398
Let me guess.
We're not gonna go
to the movies tonight.

05:18.319 --> 05:21.652
Give me her number.
Working for the CIA
has a few benefits,

05:21.739 --> 05:24.071
like waterboarding terrorists,
and pretty decent bagels,

05:24.158 --> 05:26.149
and the ability
to triangulate
cell phone calls.

05:26.243 --> 05:27.278
What is it?

05:27.369 --> 05:29.746
703-555-0187.

05:31.999 --> 05:34.911
When we get
the cell tower locations,
we can hop on Google Maps

05:35.002 --> 05:38.165
and get a general sense
of where she's headed.

05:40.424 --> 05:41.755
Thank you.

05:42.760 --> 05:44.045
I owe you.

05:46.639 --> 05:49.756
It'll be okay, Noah.
We'll find her.
We will.

05:57.983 --> 05:59.939
(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)

06:07.701 --> 06:10.659
GRETCHEN:
We came all this way
to go to a carnival?

06:11.664 --> 06:13.120
I guess so.

06:15.584 --> 06:17.996
Compass is locked
right onto it.

06:19.338 --> 06:24.048
I've always said I belonged
in a freak show.
Just never took it literally.

06:34.270 --> 06:35.635
I know why you're here.

06:35.729 --> 06:36.809
Good.

06:37.815 --> 06:41.148
Then you'll save me
from the long-winded
wind up.

06:42.695 --> 06:44.936
Peter, there are
five stages of grief.

06:45.030 --> 06:46.736
You need to leap
over denial phase

06:46.824 --> 06:49.065
and get right into
the acceptance
of this whole thing.

06:49.159 --> 06:50.239
He's not dead, Mom.

06:50.327 --> 06:52.739
Sweetheart, Nathan died
months ago.

06:52.830 --> 06:55.697
Despite my own grand
gestures of denial.

06:55.958 --> 06:58.665
No. He's in there.
In Sylar.

06:58.836 --> 07:01.077
Why do you think
we're still standing?
Nathan kept us alive.

07:01.171 --> 07:03.457
So, I'm gonna find him,

07:03.549 --> 07:05.460
and I'm gonna take Sylar down
once and for all.

07:05.551 --> 07:08.088
How do you intend
to fight him
with all the powers he has?

07:08.178 --> 07:10.920
Won't be too hard
once I take them away.

07:11.015 --> 07:12.346
Thanks for coming, Rene.

07:13.183 --> 07:15.014
The least I can do.

07:17.730 --> 07:20.847
Please, Peter,
think about
what you're doing.

07:21.900 --> 07:24.642
l have. Gonna go
get Nathan back.

07:24.862 --> 07:28.650
What happens when
you find out there's not
a Nathan to get back?

07:28.782 --> 07:31.114
Guess I'll just
settle for revenge.

07:38.208 --> 07:40.073
Maybe we shouldn't do this.

07:40.169 --> 07:42.410
What? We've been
driving for 21 hours.

07:42.504 --> 07:44.790
I know.
It was a stupid idea.

07:44.882 --> 07:46.918
What if we run into
psycho Becky in there?

07:47.009 --> 07:48.965
She already tried
to kill you once.

07:49.053 --> 07:52.136
Twice, actually.
But you'll protect me,
won't you?

07:52.222 --> 07:55.680
Look, I'm serious. Okay?
You don't have to do this.

07:56.602 --> 07:58.968
And now
that I think about it,
neither do I.

07:59.063 --> 08:00.974
Claire. Claire, wait.

08:01.607 --> 08:04.314
I'm here because of you.
To support you,
no matter what.

08:04.401 --> 08:05.652
So you have to do this.

08:05.736 --> 08:06.725
Do I?

08:06.820 --> 08:08.196
We've been on
the road for a day,

08:08.280 --> 08:11.397
but you've been
on this road your whole life,
and it's led you here.

08:11.492 --> 08:14.199
So you have to
at least check it out.

08:15.746 --> 08:16.986
Claire.

08:18.791 --> 08:20.907
So glad
you could make it.

08:25.464 --> 08:28.126
I know it can look
a little scary
from the outside,

08:28.217 --> 08:30.253
but you'll get
used to it.

08:30.761 --> 08:34.845
Here. Free passes.
The whole night's
on me. Everything.

08:35.766 --> 08:37.552
You like
carnivals, right?

08:37.643 --> 08:38.678
lguess.

08:38.769 --> 08:39.929
Thank you.

08:40.020 --> 08:42.932
But we are
just looking.

08:43.941 --> 08:45.021
Of course you are.

08:45.109 --> 08:47.851
Although I'm not quite
sure what I'm supposed
to be seeing.

08:47.945 --> 08:50.436
It's actually
more normal
than it appears.

08:50.531 --> 08:53.318
This is just the "show"
part of the business.

08:53.826 --> 08:57.364
We need to make money
in the most honest way
we can.

08:57.454 --> 09:00.617
Going from town to town,
always on the move.

09:01.208 --> 09:03.073
At least for now.

09:03.168 --> 09:06.285
Till we find a better,
more permanent way to live.

09:06.839 --> 09:08.545
Hey, you two
like popcorn?

09:08.632 --> 09:10.042
Who doesn't?

09:10.342 --> 09:15.132
Well, this is the best
popcorn in the world.
And I'm notjust saying that.

09:18.642 --> 09:20.633
Wow. That is good.

09:20.728 --> 09:21.763
Tell you what.

09:21.854 --> 09:24.266
Stay until you've
finished the box.

09:24.815 --> 09:27.056
Walk around on your own.
Meet my family.

09:27.526 --> 09:29.482
When you're done,
I'll walk you back
to your car,

09:29.570 --> 09:30.776
you girls can go
back to school.

09:30.863 --> 09:32.399
Fair enough?

09:32.489 --> 09:33.604
Okay.

09:35.659 --> 09:37.820
Just until
you finish the box.

ANNOUNCER: Every tattoo,
a harbinger of things to come!

09:45.335 --> 09:48.418
What is it that
we're supposed to
be looking at here?

09:48.505 --> 09:51.497
I don't know.
But I got plenty left.

09:52.009 --> 09:55.501
You never know
what future will appear
before your very eyes!

09:57.097 --> 09:59.509
Every tattoo,
a harbinger of things to come!

10:00.017 --> 10:03.350
Her naked skin,
a canvas
to rival Van Gogh’s!

10:03.687 --> 10:06.019
Step right up,
pay your money.

10:06.523 --> 10:10.266
You never know
what future will appear
before your very eyes!

10:11.111 --> 10:13.523
Every tattoo,
a harbinger of things to come!

10:14.031 --> 10:17.239
Her naked skin,
a canvas to rival Van Gogh’s!

10:17.701 --> 10:20.033
Step right up,
pay your money.

You never know
what future will appear
before your very eyes!

10:36.720 --> 10:38.881
Well, this looks
promising.

10:40.557 --> 10:42.058
What are we
supposed to do?

10:42.392 --> 10:45.884
You ask a question,
and then you take my hand.

10:48.315 --> 10:50.897
And then what?
You're like
a fortune teller?

10:52.820 --> 10:55.653
I show you
what you need to see.

10:56.782 --> 10:58.738
Like a crystal ball?

10:58.826 --> 11:00.282
Something like that.

11:02.621 --> 11:04.282
Go ahead. Do it.

11:14.007 --> 11:16.089
Am I supposed to be here?

11:24.476 --> 11:27.092
Must be some kind
of projector
or something, right?

11:35.654 --> 11:38.896
What, am I gonna
have a circus act?

11:38.991 --> 11:40.356
(CHUCKUNG)

11:40.450 --> 11:44.443
This isn't
the future, Claire.
This is your desire.

11:51.545 --> 11:53.957
Come on.
Let's get out of here.

12:22.659 --> 12:24.160
Hi.
Hello.

(GROANS)

12:52.356 --> 12:54.347
Is this all for me?

12:57.361 --> 12:58.851
You shouldn't have.

13:03.200 --> 13:07.819
No, seriously.
You really, really
shouldn't have.

13:36.274 --> 13:39.892
Listen, Peter.
I'm pretty disappointed
in you.

13:41.071 --> 13:44.279
Your plan was to
syringe me in the neck
with drugs.

13:47.619 --> 13:49.701
Wasn't that
the old plan?

13:51.248 --> 13:56.288
I mean, don't get me wrong,
congrats for pulling it off
in the first place.

13:58.588 --> 14:00.579
But fool me twice,
you know?

14:01.842 --> 14:02.957
Yeah, I know.

14:03.051 --> 14:04.257
(GROANS)

14:17.774 --> 14:19.605
What the hell
did you do?

14:19.693 --> 14:21.103
Our Haitian friend.

14:23.488 --> 14:25.103
I took his ability.

14:28.744 --> 14:31.406
Mind-erasing and
power-blocking.

14:35.459 --> 14:37.290
Now give me
my brother back.

14:48.138 --> 14:50.049
Nathan's pretty dead, Peter.
I should know.

14:50.140 --> 14:51.471
(GROANlNG)

14:57.314 --> 15:00.181
He's still in you.
And I'm gonna get him back.

15:01.109 --> 15:03.316
What are you gonna do?

15:03.403 --> 15:05.189
Beat him out of me?

15:11.953 --> 15:13.989
Something like that.

15:17.876 --> 15:19.207
(GROANlNG)

15:27.302 --> 15:29.258
Hurts, doesn't it?

15:33.016 --> 15:35.132
No healing power.

15:40.273 --> 15:41.683
(SCREAMING)

15:44.319 --> 15:45.354
Oh, God!

15:45.487 --> 15:46.476
What do you want?

15:46.571 --> 15:47.981
I wanna make a deal.

15:48.698 --> 15:52.816
I'll let up.
I'll let you heal,
but you give me Nathan.

15:53.328 --> 15:55.535
You give him back to me,
body and soul.

15:57.040 --> 16:00.532
Sounds like a pretty
one-sided deal to me.

16:00.627 --> 16:01.787
It is.

16:02.546 --> 16:04.127
So what's it
gonna be?

16:08.552 --> 16:10.213
(NAIL GUN SHOOTING)
(GROANlNG)

16:11.179 --> 16:13.636
(LAUGHING)

16:17.435 --> 16:20.563
You're gonna need
a lot more nails
in that thing.

16:28.780 --> 16:33.774
That's fine.
I'll just take away
everything that's you

16:33.952 --> 16:35.817
until Nathan is
the only one left.

16:35.912 --> 16:39.404
lwould love
to see you try.

16:42.586 --> 16:44.542
Come on, Nathan.
I know you're in there.

16:44.629 --> 16:47.496
Go ahead. Kill me.

16:47.591 --> 16:49.297
Come on.
I can't do this alone.

16:51.219 --> 16:52.425
Please.

17:10.280 --> 17:11.816
Peter.

17:11.907 --> 17:13.147
Is that really you?

17:18.121 --> 17:20.533
What did she mean
about seeing
your desires?

17:20.624 --> 17:22.034
Noidea.

17:22.125 --> 17:25.037
Do you have some
secret desire to be
a circus performer?

17:25.128 --> 17:26.459
Not that I know of.

17:26.630 --> 17:29.918
This place is starting
to give me the willies,
so maybe we should just...

17:30.008 --> 17:31.714
Kind of amazing,
though.

17:31.801 --> 17:36.261
I mean, these people
have all figured out a way
to use their abilities.

17:36.598 --> 17:38.634
They're conning
people, Claire.

17:39.643 --> 17:42.225
At least they're living
out in the open.

17:42.312 --> 17:43.802
In a freak show.

17:44.481 --> 17:46.392
Look, I can think
of worse things.

17:46.483 --> 17:49.099
Try having
the government
hunt you down.

17:49.861 --> 17:53.479
Maybe I can be the girl
who gets sawed
in half every night.

17:53.615 --> 17:54.900
Now, that's something
to aspire to.

17:54.991 --> 17:56.151
Yeah.

17:59.663 --> 18:02.780
Give me three more balls.
I'm going for
that big stuffed tiger.

18:03.124 --> 18:05.331
That's not fair.
You've had your turn.

18:06.002 --> 18:09.620
Watch and learn, missy.
Three years pitching
in the Minors, dude.

18:10.173 --> 18:11.583
I'm gonna clean you out.

18:15.011 --> 18:17.002
Ooh! Ouch.

18:23.186 --> 18:25.893
Hey, that ball was headed
right down the middle.
What the hell did you do?

18:26.022 --> 18:29.185
I'm not the one that
pitched in the Minors
for three years.

18:29.818 --> 18:30.807
Double or nothing.

18:30.902 --> 18:32.563
All right.
It's your money, man.

18:32.654 --> 18:34.315
How's he doing it?

18:34.864 --> 18:36.320
Watch his right hand.

18:41.371 --> 18:42.702
(CHUCKLES)

18:44.499 --> 18:45.534
Sorry.

18:46.710 --> 18:49.747
All right, little lady.
Your turn.

18:50.588 --> 18:54.251
So that guy was a jerk,
but it doesn't give them
a right to rip him off.

18:58.221 --> 18:59.427
(CHEERING)
MAN: Wow!

18:59.514 --> 19:00.503
Whoo!

19:00.598 --> 19:03.556
All right.
Congratulations.

19:03.643 --> 19:05.019
Thank you so much.

19:05.103 --> 19:06.968
All right, who's next?
Let's go.

19:07.063 --> 19:08.564
Come on!
Three balls for $1.

19:08.648 --> 19:10.559
Looks like
our time is up.

19:13.903 --> 19:16.736
Evening, ladies.
Hope you liked
what you saw.

19:17.240 --> 19:18.605
Not really.

19:19.617 --> 19:23.235
If you're interested,
I'll show you backstage
where we all live.

19:23.371 --> 19:24.952
No, thanks.
We'd love to.

19:25.081 --> 19:28.289
You're more than welcome
to join us. We don't
exclude anyone here.

19:37.302 --> 19:42.296
All of southern Ohio.
That's great.
Needle in a haystack.

19:42.599 --> 19:45.591
Hard to believe
we bagged and tagged
every one of these people.

19:45.727 --> 19:47.638
You're not gonna find
any leads in there.

19:47.729 --> 19:49.936
Carnival's a nest
we never came across.

19:50.065 --> 19:52.681
I'm gonna try
cross-referencing these
with the CIA database,

19:52.776 --> 19:54.266
see what I can
find there.

19:58.615 --> 20:02.608
Let it go, Noah.
Girls lie to their fathers.
You're not the only one.

20:02.744 --> 20:05.486
I deserve it.
Like father,
like daughter.

20:05.663 --> 20:08.951
Lying is a stock in trade
in our line of work.

20:10.293 --> 20:12.500
And you reap
what you sow.

20:13.338 --> 20:14.953
All right, fine.

20:16.299 --> 20:20.463
You want to wallow,
have at it. Unload.

20:21.971 --> 20:25.930
l have driven everyone away
with my suffocating need
for control.

20:26.476 --> 20:27.886
Come on. Everyone?

20:27.977 --> 20:29.592
Sandra, Claire.

20:32.190 --> 20:33.726
You.
Me?

20:33.817 --> 20:36.308
Yes, you.

20:36.403 --> 20:37.984
This ought to be good.

20:38.655 --> 20:44.400
Lauren, we had
something together.

20:45.829 --> 20:47.820
What, at Primatech?

20:49.165 --> 20:50.666
I definitely thought
you were cute,

20:50.750 --> 20:52.741
but we never had
feelings for each other.

20:52.836 --> 20:54.542
We did, actually.

20:57.173 --> 20:58.162
No, we didn't.

20:58.258 --> 20:59.794
We had breakfast
twice a week

21:00.677 --> 21:02.213
for almost six months.

21:03.179 --> 21:06.842
And we talked
about everything.

21:07.016 --> 21:09.268
Well, I think I would
remember that.

21:10.562 --> 21:12.644
Not if you had
your memory erased.

21:13.189 --> 21:14.850
You had my memory erased?

21:14.941 --> 21:15.976
No.

21:16.234 --> 21:17.770
You did it yourself.

21:17.861 --> 21:21.524
It was over before it began.
We both knew
it was gonna end badly.

21:21.656 --> 21:23.863
And you chose
the high road.

21:25.827 --> 21:27.533
l Haitianed myself?

21:28.204 --> 21:30.411
This isn't the way
I wanted to tell you,

21:32.333 --> 21:34.369
but you deserve
to know the truth.

21:34.711 --> 21:39.080
And what, this...
Now you're single,
playing the field,

21:39.215 --> 21:42.002
and you thought, what,
you could reignite the flame?

21:47.223 --> 21:48.759
(KNOCK AT DOOR)

22:01.279 --> 22:02.644
Mr. Bennet?

22:03.031 --> 22:04.441
Who wants to know?

22:04.532 --> 22:07.114
Name's Eli.
I'm an emissary.

22:07.202 --> 22:08.817
An emissary from where?

22:08.912 --> 22:13.030
Sullivan Brothers Carnival.
You mind if I come in?

22:13.124 --> 22:15.991
I'd rather you stay
where you are.

22:16.085 --> 22:19.418
Now, now,
where are your manners?

22:20.632 --> 22:21.667
What do you want?

22:21.758 --> 22:23.168
Something you have

22:23.259 --> 22:25.250
and we want.

22:25.720 --> 22:27.301
We don't want
anyone to get hurt.

22:27.388 --> 22:31.131
So, we'll just take
what we came for
and we will be on our way.

22:39.442 --> 22:40.648
Bathroom!

22:48.868 --> 22:50.074
He's a multiplier.

22:50.161 --> 22:51.367
MR. BENNET: I know.

22:51.454 --> 22:53.820
Okay, that's what
I call being prepared.

22:54.457 --> 22:57.699
One of them is the prime.
We shoot him,
we get rid of the rest.

22:57.794 --> 23:01.378
It took us two weeks
to find the one in Tulsa.
What's the plan here?

23:02.131 --> 23:04.292
Shoot them all
and hope for the best.

23:20.817 --> 23:22.023
Gone.

23:22.110 --> 23:23.771
So are your files.

23:38.418 --> 23:42.502
From time to time,
the ogre would return.

23:43.172 --> 23:46.505
Always bringing presents
to the boys and girls
of the village.

23:47.343 --> 23:50.756
Even though the grownups
feared him, hated him,

23:52.181 --> 23:56.675
the children knew
he was harmless.

23:56.769 --> 24:01.763
Because children
always know, right?

24:02.525 --> 24:06.017
You gotta admit,
it's nowhere near as creepy
behind the scenes.

24:06.863 --> 24:09.024
That's because
it's dark out.

24:09.657 --> 24:11.488
It's just like
any other carnival.

24:12.327 --> 24:15.160
Except for the part
about the super-powered
con artist.

24:16.205 --> 24:19.868
Everybody knows
that the games
at carnivals are rigged,

24:20.293 --> 24:23.376
and I don't see
the problem with
doling out a little karma.

24:24.297 --> 24:27.004
I mean,
they let the little girl
win a prize, right?

24:28.134 --> 24:29.795
They're exploiting
their abilities, Claire.

24:29.886 --> 24:32.377
I don't see you
running around
conning people with yours.

24:32.472 --> 24:33.882
Hey, Barbie.

24:35.558 --> 24:36.889
Doyle?

24:37.685 --> 24:38.765
Hey!

24:38.853 --> 24:40.093
What you doing here?

24:40.188 --> 24:43.646
We were just
in the neighborhood.
How long have you been here?

24:43.733 --> 24:45.598
Since you helped me
leave Costa Verde,

24:45.693 --> 24:47.229
I kind of kicked around
for a while,

24:47.320 --> 24:49.732
tried to stay under the radar.
Didn't work out so good.

24:49.864 --> 24:54.403
And then Samuel found me
and everything changed.

24:55.078 --> 24:57.615
It is amazing
living here.

24:57.705 --> 24:59.741
I finally
belong someplace.

25:00.166 --> 25:02.873
I can be completely myself.

25:03.836 --> 25:06.248
You've no idea
what that's like.

25:07.131 --> 25:09.338
I need to talk
to you about this.

25:09.425 --> 25:11.757
Are you gonna
be here for a while?

25:12.679 --> 25:14.340
Yeah. Yeah,
a little bit.

25:14.430 --> 25:16.295
l have to go
strike my set.

25:16.391 --> 25:18.222
And I'll talk to you
in a bit.

25:18.309 --> 25:19.765
Okay.
Okay.

25:23.898 --> 25:26.856
Explain to me how
you're BFFs
with a carnie?

25:27.860 --> 25:31.603
He kidnapped me once,
tried to get my mom
to shoot me,

25:32.031 --> 25:33.567
but I got over it.

25:33.658 --> 25:35.023
Excuse me?

25:35.284 --> 25:36.660
Claire!

25:36.744 --> 25:40.032
The children want to
hear one more story
before they go to bed.

25:40.123 --> 25:41.659
Why don't
you tell us one?

25:41.749 --> 25:42.784
No.

25:43.251 --> 25:45.116
I don't think
I know any stories.

25:45.211 --> 25:47.998
Of course you do.
We all have stories.

25:54.303 --> 25:55.292
Okay.

25:56.806 --> 25:57.886
Hmm.

26:03.938 --> 26:05.553
Once upon a time,

26:06.357 --> 26:07.642
there was

26:09.152 --> 26:10.187
a frog.

26:10.278 --> 26:11.267
(CHUCKUNG)

26:11.362 --> 26:15.230
And the frog lived
in a far-away land

26:15.616 --> 26:21.782
with Mom and Dad
and Brother and a tadpole
named Mr. Muggles.

26:24.834 --> 26:27.166
And the frog always
wanted to be special.

26:28.171 --> 26:30.127
What is it you people
want from her?

26:30.214 --> 26:31.920
It's not fair to
toy with her emotions
like this.

26:32.008 --> 26:34.044
She's vulnerable,
you know?

26:36.304 --> 26:39.011
We live
in troubling times,
do we not?

26:39.098 --> 26:40.838
That doesn't
answer the question.

26:41.476 --> 26:45.685
Families encompass
all manner and shape.

26:46.230 --> 26:48.687
But the defining ingredient
is love.

26:49.650 --> 26:53.188
Now, we don't profess
to offer much.
But love we have

26:54.363 --> 26:55.773
in ample supply.

26:56.365 --> 26:59.402
Something that
changed everything.

27:11.380 --> 27:12.916
I'm tired, Pete.

27:13.007 --> 27:14.213
Yeah, I know.

27:16.844 --> 27:19.005
No, I mean, I'm tired.

27:21.599 --> 27:25.057
I've been trying to
get out, fight my way,

27:26.229 --> 27:28.515
and I don't think
I can do it anymore.

27:29.232 --> 27:30.847
I don't think
I can hang on.

27:30.942 --> 27:32.432
Sure you can.

27:41.536 --> 27:45.779
You know what?
Let's go get some air.
I knowjust the place.

27:59.095 --> 28:02.428
And after they saved the world
from total destruction,

28:02.765 --> 28:07.099
the frog went back
to its family
with all that it had learned.

28:07.645 --> 28:10.261
And they all lived
happily ever after.

28:12.441 --> 28:14.818
All right, children,
time for bed.

Where's the man
in charge?

28:40.469 --> 28:41.504
You're looking
at him, friend.

28:41.596 --> 28:44.303
You're not my friend.
You stole my money.

28:44.849 --> 28:47.056
No, I'm sure there
must be some mistake.

from our customers.

28:49.478 --> 28:52.015
The hell you don't.
Now give my damn money back!

We offer our customers
games of chance.

28:55.026 --> 28:58.610

you obviously took
a chance and you lost.

Game was rigged.

Or you don't possess

to win.

the good Lord forgot to hand
a sufficient one out to you?

he has to make.

31:05.489 --> 31:07.070
It was an election year.

31:09.910 --> 31:11.616
Denial was the go-to.

31:20.796 --> 31:23.173
It seems like
a million years ago, huh?

31:24.675 --> 31:25.881
A lifetime.

31:25.968 --> 31:27.504
And we made it
through it.

31:29.263 --> 31:30.548
Together.

31:30.973 --> 31:33.510
Made it through
all the craziness,
you and me.

31:33.601 --> 31:36.308
We can make it
through anything, Nathan.

31:37.313 --> 31:38.428
Even death?

31:40.191 --> 31:41.351
Why not?

31:43.944 --> 31:48.938
Because this isn't me.
It's not my body.
Because it's Sylar's.

31:49.033 --> 31:52.776
No. It is you, Nathan.
I'm looking at you.

31:52.870 --> 31:54.076
You're looking
at an illusion.

31:54.163 --> 31:55.994
No, it's you.

31:57.041 --> 32:00.374
Look, I need you
to keep fighting
in there. Okay?

32:03.380 --> 32:04.631
I can't.

32:08.803 --> 32:10.509
He's killing me.

32:12.807 --> 32:14.638
And I can't hold on
anymore, Pete.

32:14.725 --> 32:16.511
Yes, you can, Nathan.

32:17.561 --> 32:21.395
That's why you found me.
That's why you came
and found me.

32:25.236 --> 32:29.855
I found you because
I wanted to crucify you
in Times Square.

32:32.493 --> 32:35.530
Nathan, that is not you.

32:37.748 --> 32:40.410
(GRUNTlNG) That's what
I'm trying to tell you.

32:40.501 --> 32:41.707
Nathan?

32:42.002 --> 32:46.211
Stick with me. Hey, hey.
Fight it, come on.
I need you to fight it.

32:47.007 --> 32:51.546
I need you
to fight it, Nathan. Come on,
stay with me, bud.

32:52.930 --> 32:54.215
Please.

32:55.891 --> 32:57.051
Come on.

33:07.361 --> 33:09.022
I'm sorry, Pete.

33:17.705 --> 33:18.911
PETER: Nathan!

33:19.248 --> 33:20.613
(GRUNTlNG)

33:26.797 --> 33:28.333
Pull yourself up, Nathan.

33:28.424 --> 33:29.459
Let me go, Pete.

33:29.550 --> 33:30.835
I can't do that.

33:30.926 --> 33:32.541
You need to accept
that I'm gone.

33:32.636 --> 33:36.128
I need you to help me.
Now, pull yourself up,
please.

33:38.392 --> 33:42.761
You're gonna have to
carry on for the both
of us, Pete. Okay?

33:44.982 --> 33:48.895
You tell Mom I love her.
You take care of Claire.

33:50.112 --> 33:54.401
You fight the good fight.
You've always been everything
that's good in the world.

33:54.491 --> 33:55.651
Nathan.

33:55.784 --> 33:58.446
And I got a feeling
the world ain't seen
nothing yet.

33:59.330 --> 34:00.695
I can't do this
without you.

34:00.789 --> 34:02.996
NATHAN: You can do
anything, Pete.

34:03.459 --> 34:04.619
Anything.

34:05.961 --> 34:07.292
Remember that.

34:12.468 --> 34:13.753
I love you.

34:15.679 --> 34:17.089
PETER: Nathan.

34:23.145 --> 34:24.931
I love you, Nathan.

34:53.300 --> 34:54.961
(GLASS SHATTERlNG)

35:31.880 --> 35:34.496
Why did you let him
do that to you?

35:35.384 --> 35:37.625
Life is a series
of choices.

35:39.388 --> 35:44.132
One of many I am forced
to make to preserve
the well-being of this family.

35:45.561 --> 35:47.643
You could've
defended yourself.

35:47.730 --> 35:49.391
Yeah. Easily.

35:51.692 --> 35:53.808
But we're gypsies, Claire.

35:55.529 --> 36:00.193
We weigh our decisions
very carefully when dealing
with the outside world.

36:00.284 --> 36:03.868
The path of least resistance
is sometimes the wisest.

36:04.955 --> 36:05.990
It's not right.

36:06.081 --> 36:07.412
No, it isn't.

36:10.586 --> 36:13.123
We're not that different,
are we?

36:17.676 --> 36:20.418
Both learning new things
about ourselves.

36:20.512 --> 36:24.596
Both searching for new ways
to live our lives
on our own terms.

36:25.684 --> 36:28.096
You've found that
out here.

36:31.190 --> 36:32.475
Have we?

36:32.566 --> 36:34.557
You all get to be
what you want to be.

36:35.736 --> 36:38.068
Out in the open.
Right in front of people.

36:38.197 --> 36:41.405
If we lie, bow our heads,
keep our mouths shut,

36:42.618 --> 36:46.452
let some creep punch our face
and not hit him back,
oh,yeah.

36:49.166 --> 36:52.408
I've been sold
a bill of goods
my whole life.

36:54.213 --> 36:58.047
Taught how to be comfortable
being a second-class citizen.

36:58.467 --> 37:01.459
Now I'm questioning that.
And so are you.

37:01.637 --> 37:05.425
I know
what you were thinking,
walking around tonight.

37:05.849 --> 37:11.264
That this place
is awfully strange,
yet strangely familiar.

37:11.355 --> 37:12.720
Am I right?

37:16.402 --> 37:18.233
I don't know what
I've been thinking.

37:18.320 --> 37:20.652
Yes, you do.
And you were right.

37:20.823 --> 37:23.314
We all think
it's a little strange.

37:24.118 --> 37:25.403
A carnival?

37:27.413 --> 37:31.076
But it's the only life
most of us have ever known.

37:32.376 --> 37:35.834
But we can be more.
We can be bigger.

37:37.423 --> 37:39.414
If we can
just figure out how.

37:39.508 --> 37:42.341
And I have
a strong feeling,
Claire Bennet,

37:42.428 --> 37:44.965
that you can help us
do just that.

37:46.682 --> 37:50.391
I think it's time for
some soul-searching.

37:52.771 --> 37:56.389
And you're welcome
to stay a few days
and do just that.

37:56.942 --> 37:59.274
Before you go back
to school.

38:01.697 --> 38:06.862
God, this whole night
has felt like
a bad Fellini film.

38:08.495 --> 38:11.783
Twenty-one hour drive.
Wanna take the first shift?

38:14.585 --> 38:16.200
What now?

38:16.295 --> 38:17.660
I'll see you Monday.

38:17.754 --> 38:18.914
What?

38:20.090 --> 38:22.957
I'm gonna stay.
Just for a couple days.

38:23.343 --> 38:26.085
We've got two more days
before break ends and...

38:26.722 --> 38:30.806
I know that it's hard
to explain, ljust...

38:32.144 --> 38:34.476
You need to
see for yourself.

38:35.981 --> 38:37.482
I get it.

38:41.195 --> 38:43.151
I saw your face, Claire.

38:44.031 --> 38:45.862
The way
you looked at them.

38:47.034 --> 38:50.697
Like you belonged.
Like you knew them.

38:51.413 --> 38:55.281
God, I've never had
that feeling anywhere
in my whole life.

38:57.586 --> 38:59.372
I'm happy for you.

39:17.898 --> 39:19.638
I'll see you Monday.

39:20.484 --> 39:21.690
I hope so.

39:36.959 --> 39:40.747
I'll make this right, Lydia.
lt'll all make sense soon.

39:41.046 --> 39:45.085
Joseph, the gathering
of the others, all of it.

39:45.634 --> 39:50.128
You've gone to great lengths
to bring her here.
She is awfully innocent.

39:51.723 --> 39:55.181
I'm not sure
she's going to serve
a purpose for you.

39:55.894 --> 39:57.930
It's not her I'm after.

40:27.509 --> 40:30.421
SAMUEL: My brother, Joseph,
he had the right idea.

40:31.847 --> 40:35.385
He believed that alone,
this family would be safe.

40:36.727 --> 40:39.719
And that idea has worked
for us for years.

40:39.855 --> 40:42.221
But how long
can we live like this?

40:42.357 --> 40:45.690
Wandering in the desert,
without a home?

40:46.903 --> 40:49.315
Times change
and we need to change
with them.

40:49.406 --> 40:53.069
We need to stop running,
stop living in the shadows.

40:53.201 --> 40:55.578
We should be stronger.
The problem is,

40:55.704 --> 40:59.162
there's simply
too few of us
to make a stand.

40:59.249 --> 41:02.992
If we are truly to be great,
we need to grow our ranks,

41:03.086 --> 41:04.917
bring in new members.

41:05.797 --> 41:10.211
And the newest among us
cannot be shackled with
the same burden we've borne,

41:10.344 --> 41:14.428
wandering like nomads.
They deserve a home.

41:15.766 --> 41:17.506
A promised land.

41:18.226 --> 41:22.845
Now, I've thought a lot
about exactly where
this homeland should be.

41:22.939 --> 41:26.227
And I keep coming back
to this very spot.

41:28.528 --> 41:33.898
Here, we will plant roots
and build a life.
A community.

41:36.078 --> 41:38.820
Here, we will be
oppressed no longer.

41:38.914 --> 41:41.906
Here, we will
live our lives
on our own terms.

41:42.042 --> 41:45.785
But none of that can
happen until we have
gathered the rest.

41:47.547 --> 41:51.290
And when we have done that,
we will return to this place.

41:51.635 --> 41:54.251
We will wander
nolongen

41:55.138 --> 41:56.548
We Will finally

41:58.809 --> 42:00.094
be home.
