01:39.460 --> 01:40.460
Is anybody there?

01:42.590 --> 01:43.590
Jeanne.

01:46.890 --> 01:48.140
I'm happy to see you...

01:48.390 --> 01:51.140
but to keep coming here twice,
three times a day...

01:51.390 --> 01:52.390
I need to confess.

01:52.680 --> 01:54.270
You confessed this morning.

01:54.520 --> 01:56.190
I need to confess again.

01:56.980 --> 01:59.360
What terrible sin
have you committed...

01:59.610 --> 02:01.940
that can't wait till tomorrow?

02:02.190 --> 02:06.240
I saw a poor monk without shoes,
so I gave him some.

02:06.450 --> 02:08.699
There's no sin in charity, Jeanne.

02:09.449 --> 02:11.120
They weren't my shoes.

02:11.370 --> 02:13.790
- Whose were they?
- My father's.

02:14.290 --> 02:17.330
- I'm sure he'll forgive you.
- He already did.

02:17.580 --> 02:19.540
I want Jesus to forgive me too.

02:20.250 --> 02:23.300
If we asked forgiveness
all the time, we'd spend...

02:23.550 --> 02:25.090
our whole life in church.

02:25.340 --> 02:26.380
Is that bad?

02:26.630 --> 02:29.010
Well, no, but...

02:31.100 --> 02:32.310
Are you happy at home?

02:32.760 --> 02:34.270
Yes, very.

02:34.520 --> 02:36.680
Your mother?
Everything's fine with her?

02:37.190 --> 02:39.230
Yes, she's wonderful.

02:39.440 --> 02:42.360
And your sister, Catherine?
Is she still your best friend?

02:42.610 --> 02:44.360
My sister's just...

02:44.610 --> 02:46.360
She's wonderful.

02:46.610 --> 02:48.610
What about your other friends?

02:48.860 --> 02:51.160
You don't like playing with them?

02:51.410 --> 02:53.370
I play with them lots.

02:54.120 --> 02:57.330
Everything sounds wonderful.

02:57.660 --> 02:59.290
Yes, it is.

02:59.540 --> 03:01.920
Then why are you here so often?

03:03.500 --> 03:05.510
I feel safe here.

03:05.800 --> 03:08.010
It's where I can talk to him.

03:09.300 --> 03:10.470
Him?

03:11.390 --> 03:13.890
Well, I try to talk to him.

03:14.140 --> 03:17.180
But mostly he's the one
who does the talking.

03:18.060 --> 03:19.890
Who is this...

03:20.810 --> 03:21.940
"he"?

03:23.110 --> 03:24.650
He never says his name.

03:26.650 --> 03:30.110
What does he...

03:30.490 --> 03:31.990
look like?

03:38.120 --> 03:39.710
Beautiful.

03:44.790 --> 03:46.170
What does he say to you?

03:47.210 --> 03:48.670
He says...

03:54.930 --> 03:59.020
He says I must be good
and help everyone...

03:59.270 --> 04:01.810
and take care of myself.

04:03.100 --> 04:05.570
Do you think he's coming
from the sky?

04:06.980 --> 04:08.490
Perhaps.

04:10.030 --> 04:14.070
But wherever he's coming from,
I think you should listen to him.

04:14.320 --> 04:18.500
Because it sounds like
he's giving you very good advice.

04:26.290 --> 04:27.300
Amen.

04:44.020 --> 04:46.060
It's wonderful!

04:47.320 --> 04:48.940
It's wonderful.

06:05.980 --> 06:07.980
Jeanne...

06:11.900 --> 06:13.820
Jeanne...

07:32.230 --> 07:33.900
Jeanne...

10:13.020 --> 10:14.270
Mother!

10:15.730 --> 10:16.730
Mother!

10:20.980 --> 10:21.980
Catherine!

10:24.360 --> 10:25.740
Catherine!

10:34.660 --> 10:36.830
Are you all right?
Did they hurt you?

10:37.290 --> 10:38.670
No, I'm fine. Really.

10:39.670 --> 10:42.210
We looked for you.
The English are everywhere.

10:42.460 --> 10:44.300
I was in the church.

10:44.550 --> 10:47.930
I was talking to the priest.
Do you know what he said?

10:48.970 --> 10:51.300
Tell me later.
Quick, hide in here!

10:52.760 --> 10:55.350
- Where will you be?
- I'll be right here.

10:55.600 --> 10:57.230
I promise.

11:05.030 --> 11:06.400
That's what I call booty.

11:43.770 --> 11:44.980
Comrade.

12:01.000 --> 12:02.830
A woman with a sword.

12:05.090 --> 12:06.670
Look at this.

12:07.550 --> 12:10.510
Frenchmen are cowards,
they've left the women to fight.

12:11.130 --> 12:14.550
If that's God's will,
then so be it.

12:15.510 --> 12:16.930
Fine with me.

12:17.180 --> 12:18.430
I love women.

12:41.790 --> 12:45.790
Hold still, bitch. How can I do it
if you keep wriggling about?

13:37.550 --> 13:38.890
Your turn now.

14:12.090 --> 14:14.800
Preserve and bless the soul
of our dear departed.

14:15.180 --> 14:18.260
Keep us safe from fear and sin. Amen.

15:06.600 --> 15:07.600
Listen, Jeanne.

15:07.850 --> 15:12.150
Your aunt and uncle are taking you
to their house for a couple of weeks.

15:12.400 --> 15:14.980
Just to give us time
to rebuild things here.

15:23.410 --> 15:24.740
You understand?

16:34.810 --> 16:37.150
We give thanks for the food
you've given us.

16:37.400 --> 16:41.650
Teach us to love this land and save it
from those who seek to destroy it.

16:41.910 --> 16:43.410
Amen.

17:07.220 --> 17:09.270
So good night, then.

17:16.020 --> 17:17.569
What will happen to her?

17:17.900 --> 17:19.940
She'll be fine.

17:20.190 --> 17:24.859
She'll grow up, find a good man,
make him some children. Don't worry.

17:25.069 --> 17:29.790
She's been hurt, but she'll survive.
Tomorrow she'll be as right as rain.

17:29.990 --> 17:31.370
You'll see.

17:36.210 --> 17:38.090
I want to see a priest.

18:00.860 --> 18:02.360
Why did she have to die?

18:02.900 --> 18:05.110
Only God can answer that.

18:05.320 --> 18:08.740
I know Jesus says to love
your enemies, but I can't.

18:08.950 --> 18:12.950
I just want the English to burn
in Hell forever and ever!

18:13.790 --> 18:17.710
I realize your anger, Jeanne,
but we must learn to forgive.

18:17.960 --> 18:19.130
It's hard...

18:19.340 --> 18:22.880
but revenge will never
bring about peace.

18:23.130 --> 18:25.510
What will? And what
will bring her back?

18:25.720 --> 18:29.300
And why did she have to die
in the first place, instead of me?

18:29.510 --> 18:32.220
Why didn't He take my life
instead of hers?

18:32.430 --> 18:37.350
It was my fault! I was late!
She gave me her hiding place!

18:37.560 --> 18:39.480
Why did He save me?

18:39.690 --> 18:43.110
Calm down, Jeanne. Calm down.

18:45.360 --> 18:48.700
I don't pretend to know God's will...

18:48.910 --> 18:51.240
but one thing I am sure.

18:51.740 --> 18:55.410
The Lord always has a good reason.

18:56.250 --> 18:59.500
Perhaps He chose you because
He needs you for some...

19:00.080 --> 19:01.880
higher calling.

19:02.500 --> 19:07.220
As long as you answer that call,
your sister will not have died in vain.

19:09.470 --> 19:11.640
I don't want to wait for His call.

19:12.060 --> 19:13.640
Jeanne, be patient.

19:13.850 --> 19:15.680
I want to be with Him always.

19:15.930 --> 19:19.650
Soon you will be able
to take part in the Holy Mass.

19:19.900 --> 19:22.940
When you eat of His flesh
and drink of His blood...

19:23.150 --> 19:25.240
you will be at one with Him.

19:25.490 --> 19:28.780
I want to be at one with Him now.

19:35.450 --> 19:37.120
So what did he say?

19:37.410 --> 19:40.040
We must bring her to church
whenever she wants.

19:40.250 --> 19:43.630
Easy for him. He's not the one
that has to do the bringing.

19:43.840 --> 19:48.380
Come on, this is important.
We mustn't let her out of our sight.

19:49.260 --> 19:53.390
Don't worry. I will watch her
like my own shadow.

20:42.190 --> 20:45.520
I want to be at one with You now.

21:16.760 --> 21:19.140
A message for the dauphin of France.

21:28.440 --> 21:29.440
A message!

21:39.740 --> 21:42.290
Captain, a message for the dauphin.

21:42.540 --> 21:43.920
I'll take it.

21:51.210 --> 21:52.260
The dauphin!

22:08.150 --> 22:11.650
Louis. Shouldn't you
be learning your lessons?

22:11.860 --> 22:13.570
I don't want to.
I want to fight.

22:13.780 --> 22:17.320
You will. But for now, you must
at least learn to wipe your nose.

22:22.750 --> 22:24.080
A letter for His Majesty.

22:29.170 --> 22:32.590
Again from this girl calling
herself the Maiden of Lorraine.

22:32.800 --> 22:35.260
I can read for myself, you know.

22:35.510 --> 22:37.550
She says she's been sent by God.

22:37.800 --> 22:41.100
Charlatans. Pity there isn't
enough wood to burn them.

22:41.350 --> 22:42.770
She'll be here tomorrow.

22:42.970 --> 22:47.770
You can't see her. We don't even know
if she is from Lorraine.

22:47.980 --> 22:49.860
What difference does it make?

22:50.110 --> 22:53.150
If she's from Burgundy,
it might be a trap.

22:53.360 --> 22:56.450
Look. Signed "X."
What sort of a name is X?

22:56.650 --> 22:59.660
Must we assume a messenger of God
can't write her name?

22:59.870 --> 23:01.240
Trйmoille is correct.

23:01.450 --> 23:05.500
She says she hears voices.
She may be a sorceress, a witch.

23:05.750 --> 23:09.000
Regnault, you see witches everywhere.

23:09.210 --> 23:11.130
She's just a peasant.

23:11.340 --> 23:14.590
A peasant who cares about her king.

23:14.800 --> 23:18.800
All she wants is to see me crowned
and permission to fight for me.

23:19.010 --> 23:22.810
Not exactly. She wants you
to give her an army at your expense.

23:23.060 --> 23:26.180
Since your mother stole
all the gold in the treasury...

23:26.390 --> 23:28.440
I don't see how you can afford it.

23:28.650 --> 23:30.650
I can see her if I want to.

23:34.530 --> 23:38.150
The English control half of France.
What have I got to lose?

23:38.780 --> 23:39.990
The other half.

23:40.370 --> 23:42.410
You mustn't see her, Your Majesty.

23:42.620 --> 23:44.580
She may be an instrument of the Devil.

23:44.790 --> 23:46.500
Well, I think you should.

23:53.380 --> 23:54.880
Here's an amusing situation.

23:55.090 --> 23:58.680
I'd love to know why
my mother-in-law thinks one thing...

23:58.930 --> 24:01.760
and my two most loyal
and trusted advisers...

24:02.010 --> 24:04.470
think precisely the opposite.

24:05.060 --> 24:07.180
Because I care about you.

24:08.060 --> 24:09.270
Come here.

24:19.320 --> 24:22.490
Your happiness has always
been my first concern, Charles.

24:22.700 --> 24:24.660
Ever since you were a boy.

24:24.870 --> 24:26.620
I know you better
than your own mother.

24:26.830 --> 24:27.830
You think so?

24:29.580 --> 24:30.960
Yes.

24:31.580 --> 24:34.750
I know, for example, the sickness
that plagues your heart.

24:35.000 --> 24:38.050
I know how painful it is for you
to have loved a father...

24:38.260 --> 24:41.180
without ever knowing
if he was really yours.

24:43.640 --> 24:45.560
Do I know you enough?

24:48.220 --> 24:50.480
What has that got to do
with this maiden?

24:50.690 --> 24:54.860
Who better than a messenger from God
to give answers to your questions?

24:55.980 --> 24:57.820
You think she was sent from God?

24:58.690 --> 25:00.610
You're a fine judge of character.

25:00.820 --> 25:03.820
It will take you five minutes
to know if she's a fake.

25:04.990 --> 25:07.620
But if she's not...

25:09.870 --> 25:12.250
then she will give you
your answers...

25:14.420 --> 25:16.840
and place the crown on your head.

25:19.550 --> 25:23.130
With respect to my lady, it will
take more than a peasant girl...

25:23.340 --> 25:26.890
I'm not interested in what you think,
or even what I think.

25:27.100 --> 25:28.890
What simple people think matters.

25:29.100 --> 25:31.890
And simple people up
and down this country...

25:32.100 --> 25:34.810
are already talking about her.

25:35.480 --> 25:37.690
You know what simple people are like.

25:37.900 --> 25:41.030
Always ready to believe
any old prophecy.

25:44.860 --> 25:46.450
Like this one.

25:46.950 --> 25:50.040
About a virgin from Lorraine...

25:50.290 --> 25:52.080
saving France.

25:56.960 --> 25:58.550
And now...

25:59.840 --> 26:02.630
this girl comes along...

26:02.840 --> 26:04.590
from Lorraine...

26:05.800 --> 26:09.560
and suddenly there's a spark of hope
in their simple minds.

26:17.860 --> 26:19.980
You shouldn't disappoint them, Charles.

26:20.400 --> 26:22.530
If they believe in her...

26:23.450 --> 26:26.490
if she can put back
the fire in our army...

26:27.160 --> 26:29.870
then I believe in her too.

26:45.130 --> 26:47.340
Stop it, Louis! Stop!

26:50.100 --> 26:52.350
Louis, be quiet for once.

27:10.240 --> 27:14.450
- She's coming, Your Majesty.
- All right. Calm yourself.

27:15.040 --> 27:19.080
I urge you not to see this woman.
It reeks of a Burgundian trap.

27:19.330 --> 27:22.340
My astrologers assure me that
the timing is propitious.

27:22.550 --> 27:23.880
Leo with Virgo rising.

27:24.130 --> 27:27.220
Have you never noticed
on the astrological chart...

27:27.470 --> 27:29.720
that the virgin is next to the lion?

27:29.930 --> 27:32.180
Supposing she's an assassin?

27:34.680 --> 27:37.440
My dear Trйmoille,
I'm not even king yet.

27:37.690 --> 27:40.020
Who would want to assassinate me?

28:31.820 --> 28:34.330
She's arrived.
She's in the guards' room.

28:34.530 --> 28:35.790
Fine.

28:39.580 --> 28:43.080
I suppose I shall have
to make a decision.

28:52.340 --> 28:54.760
Why is life so complicated?

28:56.390 --> 28:59.560
Sometimes I really wish
I could be someone else.

29:01.520 --> 29:03.520
That's a good idea, sire.

29:07.230 --> 29:08.740
What do you mean?

29:09.030 --> 29:11.650
Let someone else pretend to be you.

29:11.950 --> 29:14.660
And see if she can find me.
A brilliant idea.

29:14.870 --> 29:17.740
If she's been sent by God,
she'll discover the trap.

29:17.950 --> 29:21.290
If she's an assassin,
she'll kill the wrong man.

29:28.340 --> 29:30.220
Please. Please!

29:30.720 --> 29:34.220
We're going to play a little game.

29:35.510 --> 29:40.060
Now, let us pretend
that my throne is empty.

29:40.270 --> 29:41.890
Just pretend.

29:42.980 --> 29:44.560
Who wants to be king?

29:48.860 --> 29:51.280
Now there's a heartwarming sight.

29:54.490 --> 29:56.070
Now, let us see.

29:56.320 --> 29:58.950
Which one of you could possibly pass...

29:59.160 --> 30:01.790
as the king of France?

30:02.620 --> 30:06.540
Alenзon, my noble duke,
my royal cousin...

30:06.750 --> 30:08.500
so fine, so brave, so rich.

30:08.880 --> 30:13.010
So very rich. So far-too-rich
to be the king of France.

30:13.260 --> 30:16.930
Everyone knows I'm the poorest man
in my kingdom.

30:20.140 --> 30:21.140
Gilles de Rais.

30:21.390 --> 30:23.230
Marshal of France.

30:23.730 --> 30:26.980
Formidable to men,
fascinating to women.

30:27.230 --> 30:28.860
Feared by all.

30:29.110 --> 30:33.190
You would be perfect
to sit on my throne.

30:33.400 --> 30:36.570
So perfect that you
might like it too much...

30:36.820 --> 30:40.910
and therefore disturb
my fragile peace of mind.

30:45.460 --> 30:46.540
La Hire.

30:47.380 --> 30:48.420
My angry captain.

30:48.670 --> 30:49.920
Bravest in France.

30:50.170 --> 30:54.420
Scarred by a dozen wars but with
the heart and stomach for a dozen more.

30:54.630 --> 30:56.090
You could pass for the king.

30:56.300 --> 30:57.550
Bloody right, I could.

30:57.760 --> 31:02.100
Except that no one with a tongue
like that could be king of France.

31:11.730 --> 31:16.070
Well, it looks like it shall
have to be me after all.

31:18.200 --> 31:19.620
Why not you?

31:19.910 --> 31:21.490
Jean d'Aulon.

31:23.450 --> 31:28.370
The only man who's poorer than I am,
therefore the only man I can trust.

31:30.080 --> 31:32.880
Dignified, honorable, wise.

31:33.090 --> 31:35.670
What more can we ask of a king?

31:40.930 --> 31:44.270
- I'm not sure...
- You're not ready to die for your king?

31:44.470 --> 31:45.600
- I am.
- Good.

31:45.810 --> 31:48.770
Until then, feel free to live
like a king. Bring her up.

31:59.200 --> 32:02.120
Sire, you know how bad I am
at this sort of game.

32:02.330 --> 32:04.040
Pretend it's not a game.

32:05.580 --> 32:07.160
Make way for the dauphin.

32:17.050 --> 32:19.050
- Mother?
- Not now.

33:12.400 --> 33:14.440
I have come to see the dauphin.

34:08.280 --> 34:09.280
Who are you?

34:10.500 --> 34:11.659
I'm...

34:13.159 --> 34:18.130
His most gracious Majesty,
Charles de Valois, Dauphin of France.

34:21.130 --> 34:22.130
Yes.

34:38.570 --> 34:40.860
I can see you are a good man.

34:41.730 --> 34:43.190
But you're not the dauphin.

34:47.699 --> 34:50.699
I'm sorry to insist,
but I must see the dauphin.

34:50.949 --> 34:53.909
We have no time to lose.
Where is he?

34:55.540 --> 34:56.920
He's here.

34:58.840 --> 35:00.670
Find him yourself.

35:26.990 --> 35:29.700
Now you'll see who'll pass for a king.

36:42.520 --> 36:45.650
There's no need to be afraid, sire.

36:48.240 --> 36:49.360
I'm not the king.

36:49.820 --> 36:54.280
I know you're not yet,
but you will be soon.

37:06.090 --> 37:07.210
Out.

37:11.470 --> 37:13.180
How did you know who I am?

37:13.390 --> 37:15.220
- Her voices.
- "That's him," they said.

37:15.430 --> 37:18.060
"The one in the corner
with the big nose."

37:24.650 --> 37:25.820
Back off!

37:30.820 --> 37:32.910
My gentle dauphin.

37:33.280 --> 37:34.740
Oh, my gentle dauphin.

37:42.250 --> 37:44.000
I have a message...

37:44.460 --> 37:47.090
from the King of Heaven...

37:47.550 --> 37:48.960
for you.

37:50.590 --> 37:52.800
You only.

38:02.190 --> 38:03.560
Follow me.

38:05.730 --> 38:06.940
Your Majesty, I plead...

38:07.150 --> 38:09.940
My dear loyal Trйmoille,
I know I can count on you...

38:10.190 --> 38:11.570
As always, Majesty.

38:11.780 --> 38:16.070
To ensure our privacy.
I need to talk to her alone.

38:21.830 --> 38:24.620
He needs to talk to her alone.

38:24.920 --> 38:26.080
Fine.

38:44.310 --> 38:45.940
I was about 10 years old.

38:46.810 --> 38:51.230
It was a beautiful spring day. I was
taking a shortcut through the forest...

38:51.440 --> 38:54.780
when a strange wind...

38:55.950 --> 38:57.570
began to blow.

39:05.920 --> 39:10.000
<i>It was such a strange sound,
almost like words...</i>

39:10.380 --> 39:12.170
calling me.

39:31.520 --> 39:33.230
The second time...

39:34.780 --> 39:36.700
was many years later.

39:37.240 --> 39:40.910
I was coming back from church
when suddenly...

39:41.120 --> 39:43.080
the same...

39:43.290 --> 39:46.250
violent wind.

39:52.050 --> 39:53.460
Then...

39:55.670 --> 39:57.430
<i>a shape...</i>

39:58.010 --> 39:59.300
<i>appeared...</i>

40:01.810 --> 40:04.220
<i>in the middle of the sky.</i>

40:04.470 --> 40:05.770
The shape...

40:09.810 --> 40:11.150
of a man.

40:25.540 --> 40:27.830
Everything was moving so fast.

40:28.040 --> 40:29.040
So fast.

40:31.670 --> 40:33.000
The wind, the clouds...

40:34.800 --> 40:37.510
I couldn't move.
I couldn't breathe.

40:39.720 --> 40:42.760
I was so frightened.

40:44.220 --> 40:45.390
He was...

40:47.020 --> 40:48.020
so...

40:51.310 --> 40:52.690
here.

41:03.030 --> 41:05.120
Then I knew that God had chosen me.

41:05.330 --> 41:09.830
But I did not understand what He
wanted me to do. What was my mission?

41:10.290 --> 41:12.500
What could I do to help my country?

41:12.710 --> 41:15.670
But how? I was nothing.
I was just a poor girl.

41:15.920 --> 41:20.880
I did not know anything
about making war or riding.

41:22.180 --> 41:24.390
So I decided to wait...

41:25.260 --> 41:27.560
and not speak of it to anybody.

41:27.770 --> 41:30.270
You did well. You did well.

41:30.480 --> 41:32.980
I didn't wait long.

41:34.400 --> 41:36.480
I was going to Mass...

41:37.320 --> 41:39.320
like I do every day...

41:40.320 --> 41:41.910
when the same...

41:42.410 --> 41:44.030
strange...

41:44.490 --> 41:45.660
wind...

42:14.520 --> 42:16.730
Everything was made clear.

42:19.110 --> 42:21.320
God had given me a message.

42:22.610 --> 42:24.860
A message to deliver.

42:30.790 --> 42:32.410
What was the message?

42:41.630 --> 42:43.010
He said...

42:44.050 --> 42:46.970
that I must save France
from her enemies...

42:47.550 --> 42:50.390
and bring her back
into the hands of God.

42:51.100 --> 42:53.810
And He told me that I...

42:54.020 --> 42:55.730
Jeanne...

42:56.400 --> 42:59.020
will lead you
to the altar at Reims...

43:01.570 --> 43:03.650
where you will be crowned...

43:05.820 --> 43:07.070
the king...

43:12.450 --> 43:14.500
of France.

43:37.900 --> 43:39.980
- Sire, are you?
- Fine. I'm fine.

43:42.110 --> 43:46.280
This is, in fact, Jean D'Aulon,
my loyal friend and finest archer.

43:46.490 --> 43:48.320
Jean, I put her in your care.

43:48.570 --> 43:52.200
Find her suitable lodgings
here in the castle...

43:52.410 --> 43:54.370
and guard her with your life.

43:54.580 --> 43:57.710
Sire, I won't need lodging
if we're to march on Orlйans.

43:57.920 --> 44:00.210
Orlйans has held out for six months.

44:00.460 --> 44:04.130
A few days more won't make
much difference. Take some rest.

44:12.220 --> 44:13.600
Put the bags here.

44:15.560 --> 44:19.850
Please accept my apologies for me
pretending to be the, you know...

44:20.810 --> 44:22.610
Could I have some water?

44:22.900 --> 44:23.900
Water...

44:23.980 --> 44:26.820
Yes, of course.
Would you get some water?

44:27.650 --> 44:29.240
- Anything else?
- A priest.

44:29.820 --> 44:30.820
Now?

44:30.870 --> 44:34.120
Yes. I didn't confess today.

44:35.290 --> 44:36.450
Right.

44:37.290 --> 44:39.370
Raymond, a priest.

44:39.620 --> 44:42.960
- Anything else?
- I shall also need a new warhorse...

44:43.170 --> 44:45.880
a sword, armour...

44:46.130 --> 44:48.590
and an artist to make
a banner for me.

44:48.800 --> 44:49.800
Now?

44:49.880 --> 44:51.590
Better today than tomorrow.

44:52.050 --> 44:54.760
This might take a little time...

44:55.600 --> 44:57.730
but let me see what I can do.

44:59.100 --> 45:01.940
I shall also need someone
who can read and write.

45:02.270 --> 45:07.030
I studied at the University of Paris
until the English invaded.

45:07.240 --> 45:09.780
- I thought you were an archer.
- Yes, I am.

45:10.320 --> 45:14.450
I'm an archer who can read and write.
Who do you want to write to?

45:15.080 --> 45:16.580
The king of England.

45:18.790 --> 45:22.130
I want to give him the chance
to leave in peace...

45:23.790 --> 45:25.710
before I get to Orlйans.

45:36.510 --> 45:40.350
The archbishop and I have begun
negotiations with the Burgundians.

45:40.560 --> 45:42.150
If we bring them to our side...

45:42.400 --> 45:45.650
Negotiate, by all means,
but from a position of strength.

45:45.860 --> 45:50.700
If the English take Orlйans,
there'll be nothing left to negotiate.

45:50.900 --> 45:53.410
My lady, it will be
the height of folly...

45:53.620 --> 45:57.950
to let this child lead our army
in the king's name...

45:58.160 --> 46:00.540
without verifying her true motives.

46:00.790 --> 46:02.620
My lord Trйmoille is right.

46:02.870 --> 46:07.130
We must be absolutely certain that
she's not an instrument of the devil.

46:07.340 --> 46:11.550
How can anyone be absolutely
certain about anything?

46:13.010 --> 46:16.550
Sometimes our intuitions
are our best counsellors.

46:16.810 --> 46:21.180
We must listen to Mother Holy Church
before we listen to our intuitions.

46:26.900 --> 46:27.900
Wait.

46:29.860 --> 46:31.990
She claims to be a virgin.

46:33.110 --> 46:35.740
Well, that's something we can examine...

46:35.950 --> 46:39.040
and be absolutely certain about.

46:55.970 --> 46:57.640
Let's find out.

49:31.000 --> 49:32.580
What if she's not?

49:33.040 --> 49:37.170
If she's not, I'll kill her myself.

49:47.270 --> 49:50.940
There is no sign of corruption
or violation.

49:51.310 --> 49:53.060
She is intact.

49:57.320 --> 50:00.700
And what exactly was
this vision wearing?

50:01.490 --> 50:03.030
I don't remember.

50:03.240 --> 50:05.870
This vision, did it give you anything?

50:06.280 --> 50:08.830
An object? A ring or a rosary...

50:09.040 --> 50:12.460
or anything by which we can
verify your claim?

50:12.670 --> 50:14.290
He gave me good advice.

50:14.500 --> 50:17.840
As a child, did you have
any sort of military experience?

50:18.090 --> 50:19.090
No.

50:19.460 --> 50:21.970
Practice in the skills
of swordsmanship?

50:22.550 --> 50:25.050
No. But I'm good with a stick.

50:29.850 --> 50:31.890
Do you know what a Dijon culverin is?

50:33.060 --> 50:34.060
No.

50:34.100 --> 50:35.520
It's an item of artillery.

50:35.770 --> 50:39.980
How can you raise the siege of Orlйans
if you're ignorant about artillery?

50:40.190 --> 50:42.320
The road to Orlйans is long.

50:42.570 --> 50:47.120
And I have good captains with me.
I will learn fast, believe me.

50:47.330 --> 50:49.160
We'd like to believe you...

50:49.490 --> 50:54.420
but we feel that if God wanted us to
believe you, He'd have sent a sign...

50:55.000 --> 50:56.040
with you.

50:56.250 --> 51:00.090
So can you do something?

51:02.170 --> 51:04.180
Show us something?

51:05.930 --> 51:11.060
A sign to prove that you
are sent by God?

51:12.810 --> 51:16.480
I did not come here to perform tricks.

51:19.190 --> 51:21.820
You are all much cleverer than I am.

51:22.740 --> 51:27.120
Me, I don't know "A" from "B."
But this much I do know:

51:28.240 --> 51:32.580
That while the people of France
lie bleeding...

51:32.790 --> 51:36.710
you sit around in your fine clothes
trying to deceive me...

51:36.920 --> 51:39.840
when you're only
deceiving yourselves.

51:40.750 --> 51:42.880
You say you are men of God...

51:43.130 --> 51:47.680
yet you do not see His hand
in having guided me...

51:48.010 --> 51:52.970
through 500 leagues of enemy country
to bring you His help.

51:53.770 --> 51:55.810
Is that not proof enough?

52:01.570 --> 52:03.940
Do you still need more signs?

52:10.120 --> 52:11.830
Give me an army.

52:14.410 --> 52:16.540
Take me to Orlйans...

52:20.670 --> 52:23.460
and there you'll see the sign
that I was sent to make.

52:53.620 --> 52:55.160
- Dunois.
- What?

52:55.370 --> 52:58.250
A big one. Straight at us.

53:01.040 --> 53:02.040
What side?

53:02.170 --> 53:03.340
Window side.

53:17.850 --> 53:19.350
Dunois!

53:19.560 --> 53:20.560
What?

53:22.270 --> 53:23.400
Wonderful news.

53:23.610 --> 53:27.490
Finally, he is sending her to us.
Thanks be to God. We're saved.

53:27.740 --> 53:29.240
It's wonderful.

53:29.450 --> 53:32.280
Calm yourself, Xaintrailles.
Who has done what?

53:32.490 --> 53:34.530
The dauphin.
He's sending us food...

53:34.740 --> 53:37.910
and an army led by Jeanne,
the Maiden from Lorraine.

53:38.160 --> 53:39.750
Isn't it wonderful?

53:40.960 --> 53:43.290
Yes. It's a miracle.

53:46.960 --> 53:49.760
I can't believe they are
sending a woman.

53:51.130 --> 53:53.720
I wonder what colour dress
she'll be wearing.

53:55.260 --> 53:56.260
Blue.

53:57.560 --> 54:00.600
With a blue ribbon in her hair
to tie up Talbot.

54:02.850 --> 54:05.480
Anyone know if she knows
how to ride a horse?

54:07.030 --> 54:08.030
She knows.

54:22.080 --> 54:23.540
Were you sent by Lord Dunois?

54:23.750 --> 54:25.840
Yes, they were.

54:26.090 --> 54:28.590
- Where are the English?
- Everywhere. The food?

54:28.800 --> 54:31.220
It's coming. I rode on ahead.

54:31.470 --> 54:34.430
I have a message for the captain
of the English army.

54:34.640 --> 54:35.970
- He is Talbot.
- I know.

54:36.180 --> 54:39.720
- Can you take me to him?
- He's on the other side of the river.

54:39.970 --> 54:43.230
So why was I brought
to this side of the river?

54:44.730 --> 54:46.060
Hey, my friend!

54:46.940 --> 54:48.610
Good to see your damn face.

54:48.860 --> 54:50.690
La Hire, don't swear.

54:50.940 --> 54:56.070
Sorry. Let me introduce the king's
half-brother, the dogged Lord Dunois.

54:57.700 --> 55:01.040
Then will you show me to
the other side of the river?

55:01.330 --> 55:02.370
Wait.

55:04.000 --> 55:05.040
Wait!

55:07.040 --> 55:10.170
Fine! Go now if you want!
But not with me!

55:10.380 --> 55:13.630
You may have a duty to God,
but I have a duty to my people.

55:13.880 --> 55:15.090
They are starving.

55:16.550 --> 55:19.140
I'm going to take the food
to the city.

55:19.390 --> 55:22.560
If you can calm down and let me
accompany you to Orlйans...

55:22.810 --> 55:25.520
it will be my honour
to welcome you.

56:23.910 --> 56:25.960
Jesus Christ.

56:26.540 --> 56:28.540
The goddamn English will pay for this.

56:28.750 --> 56:33.090
Yes, they will. And so will you
if you don't stop swearing.

56:51.020 --> 56:54.030
I'm happy to welcome you
in my tavern. Come on in.

56:58.320 --> 57:00.950
La Hire, Gilles,
let me show you something.

57:09.330 --> 57:13.040
Tourelles are around here.
The river crosses there.

57:17.340 --> 57:18.420
Calm down.

57:18.630 --> 57:20.930
Don't blame them.
They've been hearing...

57:21.140 --> 57:23.850
- about you for weeks.
- There's nothing to hear!

57:24.640 --> 57:27.060
And why? Because
I haven't done anything.

57:27.270 --> 57:30.730
Why haven't I done anything?
Because none of you will listen!

57:36.610 --> 57:38.530
Why don't you join us?

57:39.570 --> 57:41.200
We're discussing the campaign.

57:42.780 --> 57:43.780
I'm sorry.

57:44.660 --> 57:49.160
Talbot has spread his forces
between these forts up here.

57:49.460 --> 57:53.590
But in the last few days some troops
have been deployed to this fort.

57:54.340 --> 57:55.840
What's this pile here?

57:56.340 --> 57:58.920
The Tourelles.
The English planned to attack...

57:59.130 --> 58:01.300
from there, but
we broke the bridge...

58:01.550 --> 58:02.590
I did.

58:04.470 --> 58:06.470
Which should keep them
quiet for a while.

58:07.140 --> 58:10.060
Now, my hunch is, the attack...

58:10.270 --> 58:12.060
will come from St. Loup.

58:12.560 --> 58:15.400
And what does Jeanne think?

58:15.730 --> 58:19.150
I don't think. I leave that to God.

58:19.400 --> 58:22.320
I'm nothing in all this.
I'm just the messenger.

58:22.570 --> 58:23.620
So?

58:24.990 --> 58:25.990
The message?

58:26.700 --> 58:31.830
We give the English a last chance
to go home in peace.

58:32.170 --> 58:33.170
If they refuse?

58:33.630 --> 58:35.460
If they refuse...

58:37.710 --> 58:39.630
we recross the river...

58:40.970 --> 58:43.180
and attack here...

58:44.510 --> 58:45.890
at the Tourelles.

58:46.760 --> 58:49.100
But the Tourelles
is virtually impregnable.

58:49.310 --> 58:53.190
If we're on the other side of
the river attacking the Tourelles...

58:53.440 --> 58:56.730
what's to stop Talbot attacking
the city from the north?

58:57.070 --> 58:58.070
God.

58:58.400 --> 59:00.780
God! Why, of course.

59:01.400 --> 59:02.780
We'd forgotten about Him.

59:07.120 --> 59:09.660
I feel a great sorrow for you.

59:10.870 --> 59:14.460
You're laughing now, but by tomorrow
night some of you will be dead.

59:14.710 --> 59:18.460
We can't just attack the Tourelles.
It's a very complicated matter.

59:18.670 --> 59:20.960
What's so complicated about it?

59:21.210 --> 59:25.680
All you have to do is what you're told.
What could be simpler than that?

59:26.090 --> 59:29.470
I am the drum on which God
is beating out His message.

59:29.680 --> 59:32.480
He's beating it so hard
it's bursting my ears!

59:33.180 --> 59:34.270
You have to understand.

59:34.520 --> 59:39.150
It's not easy, I mean, for our pride,
to suddenly be usurped by...

59:43.610 --> 59:45.950
Well, with all due respect...

59:48.490 --> 59:49.620
by a girl.

59:54.370 --> 59:55.960
So that's it.

59:57.170 --> 01:00:00.130
To you, I'm just...

01:00:00.750 --> 01:00:01.840
a girl.

01:00:02.920 --> 01:00:07.720
Put yourself in my shoes for a moment.
How would you feel if you were me?

01:00:08.220 --> 01:00:10.140
Knowing what I know...

01:00:10.930 --> 01:00:13.930
enormous gratitude.

01:00:18.350 --> 01:00:20.020
One hell of a girl, huh?

01:00:26.240 --> 01:00:27.860
I warned you.

01:00:32.120 --> 01:00:35.960
I do love her when her fire
gets well and truly stoked.

01:00:36.500 --> 01:00:37.870
Me too.

01:00:39.630 --> 01:00:42.130
Hello, my friends!

01:00:43.210 --> 01:00:44.630
Quite a journey.

01:00:45.260 --> 01:00:46.840
But we made it.

01:00:48.260 --> 01:00:49.970
Together again.
Let's have some fun.

01:00:54.270 --> 01:00:57.020
Fine. I shall look like a man.

01:01:03.780 --> 01:01:04.780
Stop it!

01:01:05.150 --> 01:01:07.740
How dare you stop me
from doing God's will!

01:01:07.950 --> 01:01:09.200
He didn't say to cut your hair!

01:01:09.610 --> 01:01:12.080
How dare you tell me
what God tells me to do!

01:01:12.280 --> 01:01:15.370
Whatever! But since He's not
going to cut it Himself...

01:01:15.620 --> 01:01:18.120
at least let someone
cut it properly!

01:01:19.330 --> 01:01:23.590
Raymond, bring the scissors.
Louis, fetch the mirror.

01:01:27.470 --> 01:01:31.050
Jeanne, stop getting so angry
about everything. Calm down.

01:01:31.260 --> 01:01:34.510
I am calm! It's God that's angry.

01:01:35.010 --> 01:01:37.100
I need to send a letter. Now.

01:01:37.770 --> 01:01:38.770
Fine.

01:01:39.980 --> 01:01:41.810
<i>To you, Henry, king of England...</i>

01:01:42.060 --> 01:01:45.940
<i>and you, Duke of Bedford,
who call yourself regent of France...</i>

01:01:46.190 --> 01:01:49.570
<i>obey the King of Heaven
and abandon your siege.</i>

01:01:49.820 --> 01:01:54.950
<i>Give back the keys to the towns you've
taken and go back home to your island.</i>

01:01:55.240 --> 01:01:58.830
<i>To you, Lord Talbot, I beg you
as humbly as I can beg you...</i>

01:01:59.080 --> 01:02:03.840
<i>save the lives of your soldiers,
do not bring about your own destruction.</i>

01:02:04.090 --> 01:02:07.710
<i>Surrender to me, Jeanne the Maiden,
who is sent here by God.</i>

01:02:11.260 --> 01:02:12.550
Message!

01:02:13.800 --> 01:02:17.100
<i>If you do not leave,
we shall raise a battle cry...</i>

01:02:17.310 --> 01:02:20.390
<i>as there has not been heard
in France for 1000 years.</i>

01:02:29.030 --> 01:02:31.320
Sire, message.

01:02:31.910 --> 01:02:34.410
<i>This is the third and last time
I will write.</i>

01:02:34.620 --> 01:02:37.870
<i>If you are still here at noon,
you will hear from me...</i>

01:02:38.080 --> 01:02:39.790
<i>to your great destruction.</i>

01:02:40.040 --> 01:02:42.580
<i>Please give me your answer speedily.</i>

01:02:43.630 --> 01:02:45.920
Go fuck yourself!

01:02:48.380 --> 01:02:50.130
What did they say?

01:02:51.220 --> 01:02:53.680
They said they'll think about it.

01:02:55.140 --> 01:02:56.140
Good.

01:02:57.010 --> 01:02:59.640
But I don't think
they'll leave tomorrow.

01:03:03.850 --> 01:03:06.400
I can't wait for tomorrow.

01:03:33.930 --> 01:03:36.010
French blood is spilling.

01:03:40.010 --> 01:03:41.180
Wake up!

01:03:42.600 --> 01:03:43.600
Hurry!

01:03:45.650 --> 01:03:47.520
They've started without me.

01:03:54.030 --> 01:03:57.200
There's a battle to fight
and a war to be won.

01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:02.200
Damn!

01:04:06.370 --> 01:04:08.040
Sound the retreat!

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.050
My banner. My banner!

01:04:11.250 --> 01:04:12.460
My banner!

01:04:19.350 --> 01:04:20.810
Open the gate!

01:04:32.480 --> 01:04:35.860
What happened?
Who gave the order to attack?

01:04:36.110 --> 01:04:38.240
God knows. It was a bad idea.

01:04:38.620 --> 01:04:40.240
Where are the priests?

01:04:40.450 --> 01:04:43.700
We didn't take them.
We wanted to make a surprise attack.

01:04:44.160 --> 01:04:46.870
Dunois, you gave the order to attack?

01:04:47.960 --> 01:04:48.960
Answer me!

01:04:49.130 --> 01:04:51.710
- Can we discuss this later?
- Sooner is better.

01:04:55.760 --> 01:04:56.760
Wait!

01:04:56.800 --> 01:04:58.010
You'll be killed!

01:05:10.520 --> 01:05:12.070
Follow me!

01:05:12.360 --> 01:05:14.360
I will give you victory!

01:05:21.780 --> 01:05:22.780
Close it!

01:05:22.830 --> 01:05:24.580
Close the drawbridge!

01:05:47.390 --> 01:05:49.140
To the drawbridge!

01:05:49.350 --> 01:05:51.150
To the drawbridge!

01:05:53.150 --> 01:05:54.150
What's she doing?

01:05:54.520 --> 01:05:55.780
To the drawbridge!

01:05:55.980 --> 01:05:58.240
- The drawbridge is closed.
- Not for long!

01:06:07.040 --> 01:06:08.120
Let's go!

01:07:38.710 --> 01:07:40.170
That's mine!

01:07:50.390 --> 01:07:53.730
It's a great victory, Jeanne.
Your victory.

01:07:54.020 --> 01:07:58.730
We must pursue the English to Talbot's
camp, unless you have another idea.

01:07:58.940 --> 01:08:03.490
First, we find the biggest army we can.
Then we return to Orlйans.

01:08:03.700 --> 01:08:06.530
- The bridge is down.
- The English are rebuilding it.

01:08:07.490 --> 01:08:08.530
How do you know?

01:08:08.830 --> 01:08:12.870
You have been with your counsel,
and I have been with mine.

01:08:24.420 --> 01:08:26.300
Come on, come on! Hurry up.

01:08:49.029 --> 01:08:50.580
Be careful with my baby.

01:09:21.310 --> 01:09:22.979
That's the Tourelles.

01:09:23.399 --> 01:09:24.529
Wonderful.

01:09:24.729 --> 01:09:25.729
Captain!

01:09:32.120 --> 01:09:35.040
The froggy whore's coming
to pay us a visit.

01:09:35.250 --> 01:09:36.910
I'd better tell Glasdale.

01:09:42.170 --> 01:09:43.800
Put the horses over there.

01:09:49.550 --> 01:09:52.260
Fathers, please bless them.

01:09:52.470 --> 01:09:54.970
- Please, bless them all.
- We will.

01:10:10.570 --> 01:10:13.070
Let's plan this attack more carefully.

01:10:13.320 --> 01:10:14.910
Good idea.

01:10:19.710 --> 01:10:20.790
Sire.

01:10:22.880 --> 01:10:25.590
We've got visitors.

01:10:45.980 --> 01:10:46.980
Glasdale!

01:10:49.070 --> 01:10:50.450
Do you hear me?

01:10:51.610 --> 01:10:53.740
You, who call me a whore!

01:10:54.160 --> 01:10:57.490
I feel pity for you,
for your soul...

01:10:57.700 --> 01:10:59.620
and for the souls of your men!

01:11:00.370 --> 01:11:04.500
Yield! Yield now
to the King of Heaven!

01:11:05.880 --> 01:11:07.340
Or go back to your island!

01:11:07.750 --> 01:11:10.880
And you, go back to your pigsty!

01:11:17.720 --> 01:11:19.350
Man the walls.

01:11:40.700 --> 01:11:42.040
This morning...

01:11:43.500 --> 01:11:46.040
God gave us a great victory.

01:11:48.590 --> 01:11:53.090
But it is nothing compared to what
He is ready to give us now.

01:11:54.130 --> 01:11:57.100
I know you are all tired and hungry...

01:11:57.510 --> 01:11:59.390
but I swear to you...

01:11:59.890 --> 01:12:04.440
even if the English were hanging
from the clouds by their fingertips...

01:12:04.640 --> 01:12:07.150
we'd pull them down before nightfall.

01:12:09.690 --> 01:12:10.690
Now...

01:12:11.230 --> 01:12:13.280
let all those who love me...

01:12:16.070 --> 01:12:17.070
follow me!

01:12:24.830 --> 01:12:25.830
Follow me!

01:12:36.180 --> 01:12:37.720
You were saying?

01:12:44.430 --> 01:12:45.850
Come on!

01:12:49.230 --> 01:12:51.610
- I go right.
- I go left!

01:12:57.360 --> 01:12:58.570
Come on!

01:13:04.120 --> 01:13:06.830
Get that fucking pot of oil now!

01:13:09.630 --> 01:13:10.750
Come on!

01:13:16.130 --> 01:13:18.430
Get that fucking thing moving!

01:13:28.650 --> 01:13:31.650
Move that fucker faster! Go!

01:13:33.440 --> 01:13:34.820
You're beautiful.

01:13:36.030 --> 01:13:37.490
Let's see if you're powerful.

01:13:53.750 --> 01:13:55.000
Do something!

01:13:55.260 --> 01:13:56.510
Like what?

01:13:56.800 --> 01:13:58.010
I don't care!

01:14:00.340 --> 01:14:01.340
Fire!

01:14:09.230 --> 01:14:10.230
Fire!

01:14:15.110 --> 01:14:16.110
Fuck!

01:14:16.190 --> 01:14:17.360
Too high.

01:14:17.690 --> 01:14:18.780
Reload!

01:14:34.630 --> 01:14:36.380
- Get out of here!
- But the men!

01:14:36.590 --> 01:14:39.130
You'll get killed! Get out of here!

01:14:50.020 --> 01:14:51.020
Come on, fight!

01:14:54.190 --> 01:14:55.190
Come on, fight!

01:15:01.950 --> 01:15:03.620
Bring the culverin!

01:15:26.390 --> 01:15:28.350
You'll get killed!

01:15:28.560 --> 01:15:30.020
- Jeanne!
- Leave me alone!

01:15:32.390 --> 01:15:34.400
Follow me! Come on! Come on!

01:15:47.530 --> 01:15:48.660
Come on!

01:15:49.870 --> 01:15:51.250
Let's go!

01:16:27.660 --> 01:16:29.780
You just killed my woman!

01:16:30.830 --> 01:16:32.330
Captain!

01:16:32.870 --> 01:16:34.460
Go to hell.

01:16:38.500 --> 01:16:41.340
Call the physician! The physician!

01:16:41.630 --> 01:16:42.630
Damn it!

01:16:44.550 --> 01:16:45.930
Louis, find the physician.

01:16:47.760 --> 01:16:49.300
We have to take out the arrow.

01:16:49.510 --> 01:16:51.600
She'll bleed to death if we do it now.

01:16:51.850 --> 01:16:54.930
There must be something
we can do for her.

01:16:55.190 --> 01:16:57.600
- You can pray.
- Good idea.

01:17:00.610 --> 01:17:01.610
I swear...

01:17:02.070 --> 01:17:05.990
that I will never swear again
in my life if You save her.

01:17:06.240 --> 01:17:08.570
But I warn you, if You let her die...

01:17:08.780 --> 01:17:10.200
You're the biggest, god...

01:17:15.290 --> 01:17:16.580
Don't swear.

01:17:16.830 --> 01:17:17.870
He heard me!

01:17:22.800 --> 01:17:24.460
Why aren't you fighting?

01:17:24.670 --> 01:17:26.300
You've been badly wounded.

01:17:26.510 --> 01:17:27.840
It's nothing.

01:17:28.640 --> 01:17:29.640
It's an arrow.

01:17:29.800 --> 01:17:31.470
And it's in deep.

01:17:38.230 --> 01:17:40.360
Stay still till the physician arrives.

01:17:40.610 --> 01:17:44.030
You'll have more luck
with this charm of mine.

01:17:44.230 --> 01:17:46.110
It saved my life at Agincourt.

01:17:46.400 --> 01:17:49.360
I'd rather die than use magic.

01:17:49.570 --> 01:17:52.910
You will die if that arrow
stays in you much longer.

01:18:15.140 --> 01:18:19.520
Well, at least this one
won't bother us anymore.

01:18:22.560 --> 01:18:24.770
Let's go to the battle!

01:18:29.240 --> 01:18:30.410
Please!

01:18:33.990 --> 01:18:35.410
She's nuts!

01:18:36.160 --> 01:18:38.620
You must stay calm. You must rest.

01:18:39.250 --> 01:18:40.460
I'll rest.

01:18:40.750 --> 01:18:42.500
But you have to...

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:44.590
promise me...

01:18:46.380 --> 01:18:49.380
that you'll go back to the battle.

01:18:49.970 --> 01:18:51.300
I promise.

01:18:59.560 --> 01:19:01.060
Jesus Christ!

01:19:01.640 --> 01:19:02.650
Hurry!

01:19:03.400 --> 01:19:05.320
Quickly! Do something!

01:19:17.830 --> 01:19:18.870
She's sleeping.

01:19:19.080 --> 01:19:20.080
What?

01:19:31.260 --> 01:19:34.050
Come on back!
Why are you running away?

01:19:37.010 --> 01:19:38.810
- Jeanne is alive.
- Good.

01:19:39.020 --> 01:19:42.140
- We have to press on the attack.
- Sound the retreat.

01:19:42.560 --> 01:19:45.150
- I promised we'd fight.
- I made no such promise!

01:19:45.360 --> 01:19:47.190
Sound the retreat!

01:19:47.440 --> 01:19:51.570
- No. That was her order.
- I'm fed up with taking her orders!

01:19:51.820 --> 01:19:54.910
She swore she'd defeat
the English before nightfall.

01:19:55.120 --> 01:19:59.040
Instead, she plays the fool,
gets herself nearly killed!

01:19:59.290 --> 01:20:01.580
Look! Look at the mess we are in!

01:20:01.830 --> 01:20:03.790
That's her mess, not mine!

01:20:04.290 --> 01:20:07.130
We are worse off than
if she'd never come at all.

01:20:07.340 --> 01:20:10.420
Now do as I say and sound the retreat!

01:20:19.350 --> 01:20:21.680
Where are you going?
Hey, come back!

01:20:21.980 --> 01:20:23.690
Come back and fight!

01:20:44.160 --> 01:20:47.210
- What are you making?
- A message for the English.

01:20:53.420 --> 01:20:55.010
What are the men saying?

01:20:55.340 --> 01:20:57.220
She's a gift from God.

01:20:58.140 --> 01:21:00.140
Some even call her a saint.

01:21:01.390 --> 01:21:03.060
I'd follow her through hell.

01:21:03.270 --> 01:21:05.350
Will you go that far
if she asks you to?

01:21:05.560 --> 01:21:08.520
Of course I will.
I've been there before.

01:21:13.820 --> 01:21:15.990
There's one thing I don't understand.

01:21:16.240 --> 01:21:17.780
If she's been sent by God...

01:21:19.450 --> 01:21:21.490
why did He let her be wounded?

01:21:21.700 --> 01:21:26.000
So maybe the good question is,
is she really sent by God?

01:21:29.380 --> 01:21:30.840
Who knows?

01:21:31.420 --> 01:21:32.920
God knows.

01:22:34.690 --> 01:22:35.980
A woman with a sword.

01:22:36.190 --> 01:22:37.360
Catherine!

01:22:38.820 --> 01:22:39.820
Catherine.

01:22:39.900 --> 01:22:41.110
Catherine.

01:22:43.740 --> 01:22:45.490
You've hurt my feelings.

01:23:42.800 --> 01:23:44.470
Frenchies!

01:23:44.840 --> 01:23:47.760
What happened to your precious angel?

01:23:49.310 --> 01:23:50.770
Frenchies!

01:23:52.100 --> 01:23:54.600
I'll tell you what happened!

01:23:54.810 --> 01:23:58.400
We sent the little bitch
back to Hell...

01:23:58.650 --> 01:24:02.700
so she can go fuck with the Devil!

01:24:04.360 --> 01:24:07.780
What are you gonna do now, Frenchies?

01:24:09.040 --> 01:24:12.710
Why not come out and fight? Come on!

01:24:14.870 --> 01:24:16.790
Bastards, wake up!

01:24:17.210 --> 01:24:19.460
Or are you too busy praying...

01:24:19.750 --> 01:24:23.840
to bring your little fucking witch
back from the dead?

01:24:25.590 --> 01:24:27.390
Do you hear me?

01:24:29.560 --> 01:24:31.220
I hear you!

01:24:36.060 --> 01:24:37.650
I'm alive!

01:24:42.360 --> 01:24:45.110
May God forgive your blasphemy.

01:24:48.620 --> 01:24:49.950
For I never will.

01:24:53.960 --> 01:24:55.540
I never will!

01:25:05.300 --> 01:25:07.890
What are you doing? You need to rest.

01:25:08.090 --> 01:25:10.560
We must wake up the soldiers. Now!

01:25:10.970 --> 01:25:13.100
My fine soldiers, wake up.

01:25:13.350 --> 01:25:15.390
My fine soldiers, wake up!

01:25:15.600 --> 01:25:17.810
To arms! To arms!

01:25:18.350 --> 01:25:19.350
Wake up!

01:25:19.480 --> 01:25:22.070
Wake up! We must fight the battle!

01:25:22.320 --> 01:25:23.440
Wake up!

01:25:25.400 --> 01:25:29.320
My fine soldiers, the battle has begun!

01:25:30.620 --> 01:25:31.620
Wake up!

01:25:32.950 --> 01:25:34.160
To arms!

01:25:34.950 --> 01:25:37.370
Wake up! The time has come!

01:25:40.670 --> 01:25:42.300
The battle has begun!

01:25:43.630 --> 01:25:44.920
To arms!

01:25:46.420 --> 01:25:49.140
My soldiers, we need this tower up!

01:25:49.300 --> 01:25:50.510
We need it up now!

01:25:51.050 --> 01:25:52.680
My soldiers, help me!

01:25:56.680 --> 01:25:57.940
Pull!

01:26:03.820 --> 01:26:04.820
What's going on?

01:26:05.690 --> 01:26:07.150
We're taking back the Tourelles.

01:26:15.830 --> 01:26:17.330
Get ready!

01:26:26.340 --> 01:26:28.050
Go wake up Glasdale.

01:26:45.480 --> 01:26:48.190
- What are you doing?
- Sending a message to Glasdale.

01:26:49.070 --> 01:26:50.070
With that?

01:26:51.110 --> 01:26:53.490
But you've got it back to front.

01:26:53.700 --> 01:26:55.660
Listen, I know what I'm doing.

01:26:56.240 --> 01:26:58.960
So either lend a hand
or get back to bed.

01:27:00.420 --> 01:27:03.170
I'm going to send a message
to Glasdale too.

01:27:08.590 --> 01:27:09.590
My lord?

01:27:11.180 --> 01:27:12.180
What?

01:27:13.600 --> 01:27:17.270
The French witch,
she's back from the dead.

01:27:17.470 --> 01:27:18.850
Hurry up, men!

01:27:20.690 --> 01:27:24.230
Shouldn't we take some time
to think about this?

01:27:24.440 --> 01:27:26.070
Sooner is better than later.

01:27:32.450 --> 01:27:33.620
To arms!

01:27:35.580 --> 01:27:36.620
Good morning!

01:27:37.790 --> 01:27:39.000
Good morning!

01:27:42.960 --> 01:27:44.040
This one.

01:27:48.710 --> 01:27:50.170
What is she playing at?

01:27:50.380 --> 01:27:53.680
I don't know! The question is,
what is she doing now?

01:27:53.890 --> 01:27:56.810
How can we plan if she
doesn't consult with us?

01:27:57.010 --> 01:28:01.140
- Did we consult with her yesterday?
- You agreed to attack yesterday.

01:28:01.350 --> 01:28:03.270
- But that doesn't count.
- Why?

01:28:03.480 --> 01:28:06.560
Because I always agree
to attack. To arms!

01:28:14.570 --> 01:28:18.450
Crazy bitch. She doesn't even
know how to use it.

01:28:19.120 --> 01:28:20.450
Come on!

01:28:27.130 --> 01:28:28.460
Come on! Go!

01:28:31.380 --> 01:28:32.550
Oh, my God!

01:28:41.390 --> 01:28:43.180
Fuck! Close the doors!

01:28:43.390 --> 01:28:44.480
Close the doors!

01:28:45.440 --> 01:28:46.520
Glasdale!

01:28:56.410 --> 01:28:57.410
Open the door!

01:28:57.530 --> 01:28:59.160
Load the porcupine!

01:29:08.500 --> 01:29:09.500
Pull!

01:29:25.480 --> 01:29:26.600
And pull!

01:29:29.900 --> 01:29:31.900
Come on! Come on, hurry up!

01:29:45.250 --> 01:29:46.250
Come on!

01:30:01.300 --> 01:30:03.890
Never wait for miracles. Stay there.

01:30:08.600 --> 01:30:11.230
French whore! Come and get me!

01:30:11.440 --> 01:30:13.730
Come and get me! Come on!

01:30:13.940 --> 01:30:15.650
What are you waiting for?

01:30:22.490 --> 01:30:25.200
Find your archers and burn that door.

01:30:25.410 --> 01:30:26.700
Right away!

01:30:31.420 --> 01:30:32.460
Move it! Push!

01:30:40.930 --> 01:30:41.970
Prepare the gate!

01:30:43.970 --> 01:30:44.970
Position!

01:30:49.230 --> 01:30:50.230
Fire!

01:30:56.190 --> 01:30:57.530
Water!

01:30:57.740 --> 01:30:58.860
Fire!

01:31:06.240 --> 01:31:07.370
Oh, my God!

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:12.000
Oh, my God!

01:31:14.750 --> 01:31:16.130
Kill her.

01:31:18.670 --> 01:31:19.800
Fuck.

01:31:20.510 --> 01:31:21.510
Reload!

01:31:21.630 --> 01:31:22.630
More archers!

01:31:30.350 --> 01:31:31.520
Fire!

01:31:38.740 --> 01:31:40.200
Fire!

01:31:51.040 --> 01:31:52.040
Perfect.

01:31:55.130 --> 01:31:56.670
More archers!

01:31:57.090 --> 01:31:58.090
Help me!

01:32:09.140 --> 01:32:11.520
We'll load this up as a battering ram!

01:32:12.020 --> 01:32:13.140
Already done.

01:32:47.430 --> 01:32:49.180
- What?
- Nothing.

01:32:54.060 --> 01:32:56.480
Help me with these men, please.

01:33:00.440 --> 01:33:01.780
As you command.

01:33:15.830 --> 01:33:18.080
- What are you doing?
- Opening that door.

01:33:18.290 --> 01:33:19.920
Isn't that what you want?

01:33:23.170 --> 01:33:25.050
Get out of my fucking way!

01:33:30.350 --> 01:33:31.720
Fill the cauldron!

01:33:34.350 --> 01:33:37.100
Fucking French! What the fuck
do you know about me?

01:33:44.240 --> 01:33:45.780
Reload. Reload!

01:33:52.450 --> 01:33:55.790
Fill the fucking cauldron!
What are you waiting for?

01:34:00.670 --> 01:34:02.630
More men! More men!

01:34:05.670 --> 01:34:06.970
More men!

01:34:15.100 --> 01:34:16.230
Ready!

01:34:41.500 --> 01:34:43.040
Pour the oil!

01:34:52.970 --> 01:34:53.970
Pour the oil!

01:35:38.730 --> 01:35:41.810
What are you doing, Jeanne?

01:35:43.150 --> 01:35:44.650
I'm playing.

01:36:03.580 --> 01:36:06.090
What are you doing to me, Jeanne?

01:36:07.090 --> 01:36:09.460
What are you doing to me, Jeanne?

01:36:10.550 --> 01:36:13.800
What are you doing to me, Jeanne?

01:36:24.060 --> 01:36:25.310
Do you hear me?

01:36:26.400 --> 01:36:27.860
Are you all right?

01:36:28.070 --> 01:36:29.190
Do you hear me?

01:36:29.440 --> 01:36:30.650
Calm down.

01:36:31.400 --> 01:36:32.780
It's over.

01:36:33.740 --> 01:36:34.740
We won.

01:36:35.240 --> 01:36:36.660
- We won?
- Yes.

01:36:44.250 --> 01:36:45.830
Fucking bitch.

01:36:49.880 --> 01:36:53.050
My friend, my soldier, in my arms.

01:36:55.640 --> 01:36:56.640
We won?

01:36:56.720 --> 01:36:57.720
Won?

01:36:58.260 --> 01:37:01.720
No, no, Jeanne.
So small a word will never do.

01:37:01.980 --> 01:37:05.190
This is victory!

01:37:05.400 --> 01:37:08.190
This is glory!

01:37:26.500 --> 01:37:27.750
What's the matter?

01:37:35.010 --> 01:37:36.180
What's the matter?

01:37:41.390 --> 01:37:42.970
This is glory?

01:37:46.560 --> 01:37:47.900
This blood...

01:37:55.360 --> 01:37:57.570
This is not possible.

01:37:58.570 --> 01:37:59.870
This is not possible.

01:38:03.620 --> 01:38:05.710
This is not possible.

01:38:11.540 --> 01:38:13.130
It is not possible.

01:38:13.340 --> 01:38:16.970
You look disappointed.
Isn't this what you wanted?

01:38:17.380 --> 01:38:18.380
No.

01:38:19.550 --> 01:38:20.680
Not like this.

01:38:20.890 --> 01:38:23.430
For weeks you've been asking for this.

01:38:25.600 --> 01:38:26.680
Now you have it.

01:38:31.820 --> 01:38:33.190
No!

01:38:34.780 --> 01:38:35.780
What are you doing?

01:38:35.990 --> 01:38:39.490
Nothing. I'm just taking his teeth.

01:38:41.240 --> 01:38:43.950
But you can't just kill a man
for his teeth.

01:38:44.120 --> 01:38:46.000
Why not? He has good teeth.

01:38:49.370 --> 01:38:50.960
Because you can't!

01:38:52.250 --> 01:38:53.630
What about all this?

01:38:54.170 --> 01:38:55.760
That's different.

01:38:56.760 --> 01:39:00.090
I mean, we were fighting for a cause.

01:39:00.640 --> 01:39:05.310
Not me. He is my prisoner.
I can take his teeth if I want to.

01:39:05.770 --> 01:39:08.940
No! You can't! Stop it!

01:39:09.140 --> 01:39:10.440
No, here. Take this.

01:39:11.690 --> 01:39:12.690
He's mine now.

01:39:12.810 --> 01:39:14.520
Here, you. Go.

01:39:14.770 --> 01:39:15.770
Go!

01:39:18.990 --> 01:39:22.700
Bravo. What about the other
prisoners? Do we let them go too?

01:39:22.950 --> 01:39:24.620
I don't know!

01:39:27.290 --> 01:39:28.290
Maybe.

01:39:36.170 --> 01:39:37.880
We must confess.

01:39:38.760 --> 01:39:40.010
We must confess.

01:39:41.800 --> 01:39:45.180
Please, we have to be confessed.
All of us.

01:39:50.480 --> 01:39:54.150
I know this is not
normal custom, but...

01:39:59.030 --> 01:40:02.990
Everything's gonna be fine.
He's gonna confess us.

01:40:05.450 --> 01:40:06.490
Kneel.

01:40:18.840 --> 01:40:20.840
Alenзon brings bad news.

01:40:21.130 --> 01:40:25.050
Thousands of English are forming up
on the far side of the river.

01:40:25.260 --> 01:40:27.970
I think we should count
our men and get ready.

01:40:29.020 --> 01:40:30.020
Let's go.

01:41:09.720 --> 01:41:10.850
I'll go.

01:41:14.520 --> 01:41:15.650
Alone.

01:41:45.970 --> 01:41:47.640
I have a message for King Henry!

01:41:48.800 --> 01:41:51.350
It is a message from God!

01:41:52.390 --> 01:41:54.270
Go home!

01:41:56.850 --> 01:41:59.480
Go now, in peace!

01:42:00.610 --> 01:42:04.320
If you do not go now,
you will be buried in this field!

01:42:07.070 --> 01:42:11.790
I've seen enough blood!

01:42:13.540 --> 01:42:15.460
But if you want more...

01:42:17.250 --> 01:42:18.580
I can't stop you!

01:42:20.210 --> 01:42:24.460
I can only warn you
that it will be your blood...

01:42:25.630 --> 01:42:26.720
not ours!

01:42:28.890 --> 01:42:32.100
I'm waiting for your answer.

01:42:47.650 --> 01:42:50.820
Never wait for miracles.
Stand by to attack.

01:43:01.500 --> 01:43:02.500
No.

01:43:04.090 --> 01:43:05.170
Please.

01:43:13.390 --> 01:43:14.760
My Lord...

01:43:16.180 --> 01:43:17.390
please.

01:43:49.380 --> 01:43:52.010
That's what I call
a goddamn bloody miracle.

01:43:52.760 --> 01:43:54.300
<i>She was on her horse alone...</i>

01:43:54.510 --> 01:43:57.810
facing the whole English army,
and she drove them away.

01:43:58.600 --> 01:43:59.810
Orlйans is free.

01:44:10.740 --> 01:44:11.860
We lost Orlйans.

01:44:13.820 --> 01:44:15.120
I want that girl.

01:44:18.200 --> 01:44:21.620
I want that girl burned.

01:44:42.100 --> 01:44:44.850
May I see the seamstress?
It's too tight.

01:44:45.060 --> 01:44:49.650
- Don't you have something more regal?
- The English took the real one.

01:44:50.900 --> 01:44:54.410
It's been muddy so long,
I forgot how good it looks clean.

01:44:54.610 --> 01:44:57.330
Did you remember to clean
what's inside too?

01:44:57.490 --> 01:45:00.660
I ask for a grandiose coronation,
and this is it?

01:45:00.870 --> 01:45:03.330
This is going to be an utter fiasco!

01:45:03.540 --> 01:45:07.000
I had three days. Your father's
coronation took three months.

01:45:07.250 --> 01:45:08.880
We should call for a delay.

01:45:09.090 --> 01:45:12.760
We can't hold up the ceremony.
The English might come back.

01:45:12.970 --> 01:45:16.140
Let them. Let them see
who is the true king of France.

01:45:25.980 --> 01:45:29.400
Damn English! We should be
doing this in Paris, in Notre Dame.

01:45:29.610 --> 01:45:31.570
It's more prestigious
and twice as big.

01:45:31.780 --> 01:45:35.450
It is the sacred place that matters,
not the size. Am I correct?

01:45:35.660 --> 01:45:36.660
Yes, my lady.

01:45:36.740 --> 01:45:41.790
True kings of France must be anointed
in Reims, with the holy oil of Clovis.

01:45:53.470 --> 01:45:57.510
- Your Grace! There can be no anointing.
- What are you talking about?

01:45:57.720 --> 01:46:00.100
The holy oil of Clovis, it's all gone!

01:46:00.310 --> 01:46:01.640
But that's impossible.

01:46:01.850 --> 01:46:05.560
It's a magic oil. Miraculous oil.
It can never be exhausted.

01:46:05.810 --> 01:46:07.770
- Look for yourself.
- Problem?

01:46:08.770 --> 01:46:09.810
I don't understand.

01:46:10.020 --> 01:46:12.980
The oil of Clovis, it was
full the last time I saw it.

01:46:13.190 --> 01:46:14.360
And when was that?

01:46:14.610 --> 01:46:16.610
The coronation of King Charles VI.

01:46:16.860 --> 01:46:20.410
Thirty years ago?
Does it surprise you it's gone?

01:46:20.660 --> 01:46:24.500
But you don't understand.
It's no ordinary oil.

01:46:24.750 --> 01:46:26.830
It's a miraculous oil.

01:46:27.210 --> 01:46:29.830
It was brought
by a dove from Heaven...

01:46:30.210 --> 01:46:33.380
to crown King Clovis
in this very cathedral.

01:46:34.840 --> 01:46:36.050
What are you doing?

01:46:36.260 --> 01:46:38.300
Performing a miracle.

01:47:57.550 --> 01:48:01.760
With this sacred oil, blessed by
the hand of God the Father Almighty...

01:48:02.010 --> 01:48:04.180
we do anoint thee, Charles Valois...

01:48:04.430 --> 01:48:09.560
to be sovereign lord and king
of this great kingdom of France...

01:48:09.850 --> 01:48:14.190
charging that ye shall defend
the faith of our Mother Holy Church...

01:48:14.440 --> 01:48:17.440
as long as ye shall live.

01:48:18.900 --> 01:48:20.280
Amen.

01:48:54.650 --> 01:48:55.980
Long live the king!

01:49:14.870 --> 01:49:17.460
- Jeanne, are you all right?
- I'm fine.

01:49:20.210 --> 01:49:21.800
Why are you staring at me?

01:49:22.010 --> 01:49:23.680
Because you have an arrow in your leg.

01:49:29.390 --> 01:49:30.970
So there is.

01:49:32.680 --> 01:49:34.770
But that doesn't stop you
from climbing!

01:49:36.060 --> 01:49:37.520
Go, climb! Go!

01:49:41.990 --> 01:49:42.990
Raymond!

01:49:45.320 --> 01:49:46.740
Take this arrow out.

01:49:52.040 --> 01:49:53.040
Look out!

01:49:55.370 --> 01:49:56.370
Be careful!

01:49:56.580 --> 01:49:58.540
Jeanne, the men are exhausted.

01:49:58.750 --> 01:50:01.460
I know, but so is the enemy.
Paris is ours.

01:50:01.710 --> 01:50:03.550
Jeanne, we're not enough.

01:50:03.800 --> 01:50:06.510
So bring up the reinforcements.

01:50:06.720 --> 01:50:08.850
Reinforcements? Where?

01:50:09.640 --> 01:50:11.180
Right behind us.

01:50:11.720 --> 01:50:14.430
Dunois with another 10,000 men.

01:50:14.640 --> 01:50:18.100
- Jeanne, look behind you!
- Never look behind. Only ahead!

01:50:19.860 --> 01:50:22.070
Do you know how to count?

01:50:25.700 --> 01:50:29.450
Of course I do! So, bring them up!

01:50:31.660 --> 01:50:35.790
Jeanne, that is not
10,000 reinforcements!

01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:40.880
That is 100 very loyal
but very tired soldiers!

01:50:43.510 --> 01:50:47.130
But where's Dunois? And where
are the men the king promised me?

01:50:47.380 --> 01:50:50.640
He never sent them!
Don't you understand?

01:50:51.260 --> 01:50:53.350
He doesn't want this war anymore.

01:50:53.560 --> 01:50:56.480
He has his crown now.
That's all he ever wanted.

01:50:57.390 --> 01:51:00.400
But my voices, they promised me.

01:51:00.610 --> 01:51:03.230
To hell with your voices!

01:51:06.440 --> 01:51:08.610
It's time to face facts!

01:51:11.160 --> 01:51:13.370
We have nothing to do here!

01:51:14.240 --> 01:51:15.580
None of us.

01:51:18.250 --> 01:51:19.620
Not even you.

01:51:25.340 --> 01:51:27.590
You don't believe in me anymore?

01:51:27.800 --> 01:51:30.510
Jeanne, of course
we still believe in you.

01:51:30.930 --> 01:51:34.680
If it were up to me, I'd chase
every Englishman into the ocean.

01:51:35.270 --> 01:51:37.480
But it's not up to us anymore.

01:51:37.850 --> 01:51:39.480
It's up to the king.

01:51:51.950 --> 01:51:53.700
You should go home, Jeanne.

01:52:08.550 --> 01:52:12.640
We cannot possibly afford to pay
for the size of army she's demanding.

01:52:12.890 --> 01:52:13.890
The girl is crazy.

01:52:16.100 --> 01:52:18.020
Orlйans was a miracle.

01:52:18.220 --> 01:52:21.730
But we can't wait for a miracle
when we build a future for France!

01:52:24.400 --> 01:52:26.780
Paris was a disaster.

01:52:27.610 --> 01:52:29.110
God wasn't with her then.

01:52:29.320 --> 01:52:32.240
If God deserts her,
what do you think we should do?

01:52:44.250 --> 01:52:48.050
Why did you betray me?
All I needed was a few hundred men.

01:52:48.920 --> 01:52:52.010
- Why did you take the army you gave me?
- Gave you?

01:52:52.880 --> 01:52:54.640
I wouldn't put it that way.

01:52:54.840 --> 01:52:56.140
How would you put it?

01:53:01.680 --> 01:53:06.690
We are, of course, enormously
grateful for your past efforts...

01:53:07.730 --> 01:53:09.530
but now your task is done.

01:53:09.820 --> 01:53:12.280
Now is the time for negotiation.

01:53:12.490 --> 01:53:14.610
Peace will only be got
at the end of a lance.

01:53:15.200 --> 01:53:18.870
Why are you so bloodthirsty?
Do you enjoy it?

01:53:20.540 --> 01:53:21.540
No.

01:53:21.580 --> 01:53:24.120
Diplomacy is far more civilized...

01:53:24.420 --> 01:53:27.290
far safer and far cheaper.

01:53:35.220 --> 01:53:39.760
I have letters here from towns under
siege, where people are starving...

01:53:40.010 --> 01:53:42.520
begging God on their knees
to help them.

01:53:42.730 --> 01:53:46.440
I'm here to answer their prayers.
And you want to stop me?

01:53:48.820 --> 01:53:52.240
France does not belong
to you, Charles.

01:53:52.440 --> 01:53:54.200
She belongs to God.

01:54:05.370 --> 01:54:08.330
If only she would just go home.

01:54:27.810 --> 01:54:29.610
What am I supposed to do now?

01:54:30.940 --> 01:54:32.440
What do your voices say?

01:54:32.650 --> 01:54:36.570
They haven't spoken to me in weeks.
Not since the coronation.

01:54:36.780 --> 01:54:38.660
No signs. Nothing.

01:54:40.280 --> 01:54:42.740
Maybe their silence is a sign.

01:54:43.580 --> 01:54:45.080
Maybe a sign to go home.

01:54:45.290 --> 01:54:49.210
It's not time yet.
My mission isn't over yet.

01:54:50.710 --> 01:54:52.960
There's still so much I have to do.

01:54:54.630 --> 01:54:56.220
How do you know that these...

01:54:56.510 --> 01:54:59.760
these voices aren't
just really you?

01:55:01.140 --> 01:55:02.970
Well, they are me.

01:55:03.600 --> 01:55:05.480
That's how God speaks to me.

01:55:07.520 --> 01:55:10.810
Even you could hear them
if you listened hard enough.

01:55:12.650 --> 01:55:14.570
You make it sound so simple.

01:55:16.280 --> 01:55:18.530
So even you don't
believe in me anymore.

01:55:19.450 --> 01:55:23.450
Jeanne, I believe in you
more than anyone.

01:55:23.910 --> 01:55:25.500
I just wish I could...

01:55:28.080 --> 01:55:29.370
help you.

01:55:29.580 --> 01:55:32.340
There is one thing you can do
to help me.

01:55:32.540 --> 01:55:33.550
Tell me.

01:55:33.750 --> 01:55:36.920
Tell the king to give back
the army that he gave me.

01:55:46.850 --> 01:55:49.230
We have to stop her, Your Majesty.

01:55:49.440 --> 01:55:52.560
If she raises an army
and attacks the Burgundians...

01:55:52.770 --> 01:55:56.150
months of negotiations
will have been in vain.

01:55:57.070 --> 01:55:59.240
Jeanne has done so much for us.

01:55:59.450 --> 01:56:02.870
I assure you, the maid has
no greater admirer than myself.

01:56:03.070 --> 01:56:04.740
But whatever we feel...

01:56:04.950 --> 01:56:08.460
we cannot allow her to conduct
her own private war.

01:56:08.870 --> 01:56:12.630
For the sake of the kingdom,
you must stop her going to Compiиgne.

01:56:12.880 --> 01:56:14.670
I can't stop her.

01:56:15.380 --> 01:56:20.300
Well, if you don't, I'm sure the
Burgundians would be happy to oblige.

01:56:20.630 --> 01:56:22.840
If they capture her at Compiиgne...

01:56:23.050 --> 01:56:25.390
No one can blame us.

01:56:29.890 --> 01:56:32.600
But it could sound like we betrayed her.

01:56:32.810 --> 01:56:34.520
- No, never.
- Good heavens, no!

01:56:34.770 --> 01:56:36.650
Don't worry, Charles.

01:56:39.190 --> 01:56:43.530
If God is still with her,
she will be victorious.

01:56:44.070 --> 01:56:45.830
But her army's so much smaller.

01:56:46.030 --> 01:56:48.870
Then her faith will have to be bigger.

01:57:03.380 --> 01:57:07.220
- Open this gate immediately.
- I can't risk the safety of my town.

01:57:10.560 --> 01:57:11.560
Take my banner!

01:58:09.240 --> 01:58:10.410
My Lord.

01:58:12.830 --> 01:58:13.830
My Lord.

01:58:38.900 --> 01:58:40.440
I can't believe it.

01:58:40.650 --> 01:58:45.490
Your romantic vision of death with
all that grass growing everywhere.

01:58:45.700 --> 01:58:48.200
I must admit you have
a big imagination.

01:58:48.910 --> 01:58:50.990
But maybe not big enough.

01:58:51.410 --> 01:58:53.450
Death is much more...

01:58:54.330 --> 01:58:55.330
simple.

01:58:58.500 --> 01:59:02.170
After a few months,
it gets more interesting.

01:59:05.010 --> 01:59:08.890
Then after a year,
it finally becomes...

01:59:10.890 --> 01:59:12.510
romantic.

01:59:17.890 --> 01:59:19.150
Who are you?

01:59:19.770 --> 01:59:21.650
You don't like my face?

01:59:22.230 --> 01:59:24.280
Maybe you'd prefer this one.

01:59:28.280 --> 01:59:29.860
Too young, maybe.

01:59:30.070 --> 01:59:31.830
How about this one?

01:59:34.740 --> 01:59:35.740
Better, no?

01:59:37.830 --> 01:59:39.500
But incomplete.

01:59:44.800 --> 01:59:47.760
Get thee behind me, Satan.

01:59:47.970 --> 01:59:53.010
Who are you to even think you can know
the difference between good and evil?

01:59:54.680 --> 01:59:56.020
Are you God?

02:00:00.440 --> 02:00:02.480
I'm just a messenger.

02:00:03.230 --> 02:00:04.440
He needs me.

02:00:04.650 --> 02:00:08.450
How can you imagine that God,
the creator of Heaven and Earth...

02:00:08.650 --> 02:00:10.610
the source of all life...

02:00:10.820 --> 02:00:14.580
could possibly need you?

02:00:16.450 --> 02:00:17.450
I don't know.

02:00:17.540 --> 02:00:20.370
You don't think He can
deliver His own messages?

02:00:21.290 --> 02:00:23.840
What do you want from me?

02:00:24.040 --> 02:00:26.250
Nothing. I'm here to set you free.

02:00:28.800 --> 02:00:30.840
I said smile. You have visitors.

02:00:31.090 --> 02:00:33.430
The Duke of Burgundy.

02:00:45.060 --> 02:00:47.230
So here's the famous Jeanne...

02:00:47.980 --> 02:00:51.070
saviour of Orlйans,
terror of the English.

02:00:51.400 --> 02:00:54.950
My king will pay any ransom you ask.

02:00:55.160 --> 02:00:58.450
Your king? Yes, of course.

02:00:58.660 --> 02:01:01.370
What will he pay me with?
Cows? Chickens?

02:01:01.540 --> 02:01:05.080
I prefer gold, and
the English have plenty.

02:01:06.340 --> 02:01:10.010
I wonder how much they'll pay
to have the witch of Orlйans.

02:01:10.220 --> 02:01:15.010
The English are arrogant, they can't
accept being defeated by a peasant girl.

02:01:15.220 --> 02:01:17.430
It has to have been the Devil's work.

02:01:17.760 --> 02:01:20.020
God defeated the English.

02:01:20.270 --> 02:01:22.730
And God who allowed you to be caught?

02:01:24.310 --> 02:01:28.400
I don't believe in God.
I don't believe in the Devil either.

02:01:28.610 --> 02:01:31.950
That's why I'm never disappointed.

02:01:33.530 --> 02:01:34.740
Sell her.

02:01:52.550 --> 02:01:53.800
To pay Jeanne's ransom.

02:01:54.050 --> 02:01:58.640
All the captains gave what they could,
as well as citizens of Orlйans.

02:01:58.850 --> 02:02:01.930
That's very generous of you.
How much?

02:02:02.180 --> 02:02:03.230
Ten thousand gold crowns.

02:02:03.770 --> 02:02:04.980
Ten thousand?

02:02:05.350 --> 02:02:06.690
That's a lot.

02:02:07.230 --> 02:02:10.820
Your Grace, I place you in charge
of this delicate negotiation.

02:02:26.080 --> 02:02:29.040
Get yourself ready. You're leaving.

02:02:32.420 --> 02:02:33.420
Who are you?

02:02:33.510 --> 02:02:35.880
Pierre Cauchon, Bishop of Beauvais.

02:02:36.630 --> 02:02:40.350
As you were captured in my diocese,
it's my duty to conduct the trial.

02:02:41.600 --> 02:02:42.890
Trial?

02:02:44.390 --> 02:02:45.390
What trial?

02:02:45.440 --> 02:02:49.020
Your trial, Jeanne,
on a charge of heresy.

02:02:52.030 --> 02:02:54.280
But my king...

02:02:55.530 --> 02:02:57.700
Didn't he pay my ransom?

02:02:57.910 --> 02:03:01.080
The English care more about you
than the French.

02:03:01.280 --> 02:03:02.540
The English?

02:03:03.370 --> 02:03:04.830
They paid your ransom.

02:03:05.330 --> 02:03:09.170
Tomorrow you'll be transferred
to their castle at Rouen.

02:04:10.850 --> 02:04:14.440
Our Christian king, Henry VI,
king of England and France...

02:04:14.650 --> 02:04:17.940
places this girl in our hands,
accused of heretical deeds...

02:04:18.190 --> 02:04:20.410
to be tried in a matter of faith.

02:04:20.990 --> 02:04:22.450
Take the Holy Gospels...

02:04:22.660 --> 02:04:26.450
and swear to tell the truth
regarding anything you may be asked.

02:04:27.870 --> 02:04:32.210
I don't know what you'll ask me. You
may ask things I won't want to answer.

02:04:32.880 --> 02:04:35.460
You will tell the truth
about everything.

02:04:35.710 --> 02:04:39.880
I will willingly tell the truth
about all earthly things.

02:04:40.090 --> 02:04:44.180
But as to my revelations,
I've told no one except my king...

02:04:45.470 --> 02:04:48.310
Charles VII, the one
and only king of France.

02:04:50.640 --> 02:04:52.810
You must take the oath.

02:04:53.020 --> 02:04:56.730
Not even a king would refuse to take
an oath in a matter of faith.

02:04:56.940 --> 02:04:59.820
I will tell you all
that I'm allowed to tell you.

02:05:00.650 --> 02:05:02.360
But as for the rest...

02:05:02.740 --> 02:05:06.330
even if you threaten to cut off
my head, I won't tell you.

02:05:11.790 --> 02:05:15.790
Begin with your name, assuming
you're allowed to tell us that much.

02:05:17.630 --> 02:05:19.170
My name is Jeanne.

02:05:20.760 --> 02:05:24.180
My little cross was taken from me.
May I have it back?

02:05:24.390 --> 02:05:27.010
Show us a little more cooperation first.

02:05:27.760 --> 02:05:29.430
Where were you born?

02:05:29.930 --> 02:05:32.440
In a village called Domrйmy.

02:05:32.640 --> 02:05:33.640
How old are you?

02:05:34.480 --> 02:05:36.770
Nineteen. Or thereabouts.

02:05:37.020 --> 02:05:38.690
Were you baptized?

02:05:40.030 --> 02:05:41.030
Yes.

02:05:41.190 --> 02:05:42.610
Recite Our Lord's Prayer.

02:05:44.660 --> 02:05:47.410
Not unless you hear my confession.

02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:54.080
Listen to me very carefully.

02:05:54.330 --> 02:05:56.500
We are all men of faith...

02:05:56.840 --> 02:06:01.300
and we shall earnestly strive for
the salvation of your body and soul.

02:06:01.510 --> 02:06:03.630
We do this in the name
of our Church...

02:06:03.840 --> 02:06:06.050
who opens her arms
to those who return to her.

02:06:06.260 --> 02:06:11.020
We cannot help you unless you submit
to our judgement and authority.

02:06:11.220 --> 02:06:13.690
Take heed of this
charitable admonition...

02:06:13.940 --> 02:06:16.400
for if you persist
in refusing our help...

02:06:16.650 --> 02:06:21.150
we shall have no choice but to
abandon you to the secular powers.

02:06:21.400 --> 02:06:24.900
I think you know the punishment
that would await you.

02:06:29.830 --> 02:06:30.990
Now...

02:06:32.080 --> 02:06:34.790
will you please recite
Our Lord's Prayer?

02:06:37.380 --> 02:06:40.090
Not unless you hear my confession.

02:06:43.670 --> 02:06:47.800
You aren't helping yourself by
refusing to submit to our judgement.

02:06:48.510 --> 02:06:51.560
You, who claim to be my judges...

02:06:51.850 --> 02:06:52.850
you be careful!

02:06:53.730 --> 02:06:55.480
For you too will be judged.

02:06:56.770 --> 02:06:58.230
Take the prisoner away!

02:07:01.400 --> 02:07:02.690
Silence!

02:07:03.780 --> 02:07:04.780
Silence!

02:07:04.860 --> 02:07:06.610
Clear the room!

02:07:07.110 --> 02:07:09.620
Clear the room! Clear the room!

02:07:11.450 --> 02:07:16.000
In future, we should conduct our
inquiries away from public pressure.

02:07:16.250 --> 02:07:19.380
Let the English burn her.
Why must it involve us?

02:07:19.580 --> 02:07:23.550
Because it's our clear duty to root
out heresy wherever we find it.

02:07:25.130 --> 02:07:26.130
Father Vincente.

02:07:27.880 --> 02:07:30.390
You're the most venerable here.
What do you think?

02:07:30.890 --> 02:07:32.970
I think this trial is a masquerade.

02:07:33.890 --> 02:07:35.600
I won't be part of it anymore.

02:07:35.850 --> 02:07:39.190
I'm willing to be her judge,
but not her executioner.

02:07:39.940 --> 02:07:41.860
That's what I'm trying to ensure.

02:07:44.530 --> 02:07:48.490
The verdict comes at the end
of a trial, Cauchon...

02:07:48.700 --> 02:07:50.030
not at the beginning.

02:07:52.160 --> 02:07:54.080
I am going back to Rome...

02:07:54.290 --> 02:07:57.210
to give my report to
our Holy Father, the Pope.

02:07:59.920 --> 02:08:03.880
This is ridiculous. Now I'm the one
who's on trial and being judged.

02:08:04.340 --> 02:08:05.630
Arrest him.

02:08:05.920 --> 02:08:07.130
What are you doing?

02:08:07.380 --> 02:08:09.720
This is an ecclesiastical court!

02:08:09.930 --> 02:08:11.970
This is English territory.

02:08:12.180 --> 02:08:14.100
I have the right to do anything.

02:08:14.350 --> 02:08:15.680
Is that clear?

02:08:32.450 --> 02:08:36.080
Our Father, who art in Heaven,
hallowed be Thy name.

02:08:36.290 --> 02:08:39.080
Give us this day our daily bread.
Forgive us our trespasses.

02:08:39.330 --> 02:08:43.170
Forgive us. Forgive and not...
Forgive us, then forgive them.

02:08:43.920 --> 02:08:46.750
Forgive them, then forgive us.
Forgive them.

02:08:46.960 --> 02:08:48.630
Why did you yell out there?

02:08:53.260 --> 02:08:56.510
What are you doing?
You can't stay here. Go away!

02:08:56.720 --> 02:08:59.520
Why? Are you waiting
for someone else?

02:09:00.890 --> 02:09:01.890
Yes.

02:09:02.480 --> 02:09:03.480
Who?

02:09:04.310 --> 02:09:05.310
My visions.

02:09:05.730 --> 02:09:07.280
Your visions?

02:09:08.400 --> 02:09:10.570
They're going to visit you in here?

02:09:10.820 --> 02:09:13.030
Yes. That's what I pray for.

02:09:13.950 --> 02:09:18.410
I want to see that. Mind if I stay
on the side? I won't bother you.

02:09:19.160 --> 02:09:22.830
No! No! You can't!
Or else they won't come.

02:09:23.040 --> 02:09:26.000
- Why won't they?
- Because I have to be alone.

02:09:26.460 --> 02:09:29.760
They won't come anyway.

02:09:30.630 --> 02:09:32.220
What do you mean?

02:09:32.430 --> 02:09:33.510
Why would they?

02:09:34.840 --> 02:09:39.720
Because I've been faithful to God, and
I've followed everything He's said.

02:09:39.970 --> 02:09:43.770
- I've done everything He's ever asked.
- God asked you to do something?

02:09:48.270 --> 02:09:49.940
Yes. Lots of things.

02:09:50.190 --> 02:09:54.910
You mean God said,
"I need you, Jeanne"?

02:09:56.570 --> 02:09:57.660
No.

02:09:57.870 --> 02:10:00.700
But He sent me signs.

02:10:02.540 --> 02:10:05.040
Signs. What signs?

02:10:07.340 --> 02:10:08.960
The wind. The wind.

02:10:13.510 --> 02:10:14.510
Wind?

02:10:14.880 --> 02:10:17.390
And the clouds. Ringing.

02:10:20.560 --> 02:10:21.810
Ringing cloud?

02:10:22.770 --> 02:10:25.400
The dance. The dance.

02:10:28.610 --> 02:10:29.980
The dance.

02:10:30.980 --> 02:10:31.980
The dance.

02:10:34.110 --> 02:10:35.110
The dance.

02:10:39.410 --> 02:10:40.410
The sword.

02:10:40.620 --> 02:10:44.080
The sword lying in the field.
That was a sign.

02:10:44.290 --> 02:10:47.580
No, that was a sword in a field.

02:10:49.960 --> 02:10:51.630
No. That was a sign.

02:10:51.840 --> 02:10:54.630
No. That was a sword in a field.

02:10:54.840 --> 02:10:57.300
It can't just get there by itself.

02:10:58.220 --> 02:11:01.850
It can't. A sword just
doesn't get there by itself.

02:11:02.060 --> 02:11:06.140
True. Every event has an infinite
number of causes, so why pick one?

02:11:06.350 --> 02:11:09.190
There are many ways a sword
might get to a field.

02:11:14.690 --> 02:11:18.160
Seems a perfectly valid explanation,
but how about this one?

02:11:24.370 --> 02:11:26.210
There are other possibilities.

02:11:31.170 --> 02:11:32.210
Or even faster.

02:11:35.920 --> 02:11:38.800
And that's without counting
the inexplicable.

02:11:41.300 --> 02:11:45.390
From an infinite number of
possibilities, you had to pick this.

02:11:59.280 --> 02:12:02.450
You didn't see what was, Jeanne.

02:12:03.200 --> 02:12:06.200
You saw what you wanted to see.

02:12:22.470 --> 02:12:26.390
This voice that you say
appears to you...

02:12:26.640 --> 02:12:30.400
is it an angel or a saint,
or does it come from God?

02:12:31.150 --> 02:12:34.900
I won't tell you any more about that.
I'm more afraid...

02:12:35.150 --> 02:12:37.490
of displeasing Him
than not answering you.

02:12:38.240 --> 02:12:41.360
You're afraid of displeasing God
by telling the truth?

02:12:41.570 --> 02:12:42.570
No.

02:12:42.660 --> 02:12:44.830
Did God forbid you
to tell the truth?

02:12:45.030 --> 02:12:46.030
No.

02:12:46.080 --> 02:12:49.870
My revelations were for
the king of France, not for you.

02:12:51.960 --> 02:12:56.840
When you first saw your king,
was there an angel over his head?

02:12:57.050 --> 02:12:58.800
If there was, I did not see it.

02:12:59.010 --> 02:13:01.840
Why did your king believe in you
without any proof?

02:13:03.050 --> 02:13:04.430
Go and ask him yourself.

02:13:18.940 --> 02:13:20.360
Dinner.

02:13:35.670 --> 02:13:38.880
When you were taken prisoner,
did you have a horse?

02:13:39.300 --> 02:13:42.380
Yes. A half-steed. Black.

02:13:42.590 --> 02:13:45.010
- And who gave you that horse?
- My king.

02:13:45.220 --> 02:13:46.470
How many did he give you?

02:13:49.850 --> 02:13:54.810
Five steeds and a few hackneys.

02:13:55.060 --> 02:13:58.270
As much as for a lord.
What an honour.

02:13:58.480 --> 02:14:01.690
Did he give you other wealth
apart from those horses?

02:14:01.900 --> 02:14:02.900
No.

02:14:03.400 --> 02:14:07.700
What about all those dresses you were
given? Silk dresses, weren't they?

02:14:09.120 --> 02:14:12.080
Yes. Yes, I was given a few.

02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:16.500
But I never had time to wear them.

02:14:16.710 --> 02:14:20.090
Still, pretty wealthy for a peasant
girl, wouldn't you say?

02:14:22.670 --> 02:14:26.640
You look pretty wealthy for a servant
of God, wouldn't you say?

02:14:32.270 --> 02:14:34.980
You launched an attack on Paris,
didn't you?

02:14:35.190 --> 02:14:36.350
I tried to.

02:14:36.560 --> 02:14:40.020
You ordered Paris to surrender
in the name of the King of Heaven?

02:14:40.860 --> 02:14:44.280
No, I said, "Surrender in the name
of the king of France."

02:14:44.490 --> 02:14:47.320
That is not what is written
in the evidence.

02:14:48.660 --> 02:14:50.030
Look for yourself.

02:14:52.500 --> 02:14:53.500
I can't read.

02:14:55.120 --> 02:14:56.920
Yes, I forgot.

02:14:57.630 --> 02:15:01.670
God sent us an illiterate peasant
to carry out an important mission.

02:15:01.880 --> 02:15:04.260
Do you think God
made the right decision?

02:15:04.470 --> 02:15:08.010
To take an ignorant girl to save
the kingdom of France?

02:15:08.850 --> 02:15:10.430
I leave that answer to God.

02:15:15.140 --> 02:15:16.310
Fuck!

02:15:16.810 --> 02:15:18.440
Calm down, I beg you.

02:15:18.690 --> 02:15:21.820
How can I, when I'm the
laughingstock of the court?

02:15:22.030 --> 02:15:26.280
This girl has a way with people,
but we're making progress every day.

02:15:26.490 --> 02:15:30.240
As long as she's alive, our armies
refuse to fight. Understand?

02:15:30.450 --> 02:15:32.290
They need proof God's on their side!

02:15:32.490 --> 02:15:35.250
It's not for us to burn her.
That's your prerogative.

02:15:35.460 --> 02:15:37.120
You must find her guilty!

02:15:37.330 --> 02:15:40.460
We can't do that unless
she admits to blasphemy.

02:15:40.670 --> 02:15:42.170
What are you waiting for?

02:15:42.380 --> 02:15:45.420
You've got a castle full of racks!
Torture her!

02:15:45.630 --> 02:15:48.430
You'll never get anything
out of her that way.

02:15:48.640 --> 02:15:50.970
And besides...

02:15:51.300 --> 02:15:56.430
you must realize that several
of my colleagues are scared.

02:15:57.310 --> 02:15:59.310
Scared? Of a girl?

02:15:59.520 --> 02:16:01.560
Scared to make a mistake.

02:16:02.230 --> 02:16:04.070
Suppose she's right.

02:16:04.440 --> 02:16:06.860
Suppose she has been sent by God.

02:16:11.370 --> 02:16:12.660
Whose side are you on?

02:16:13.080 --> 02:16:15.950
I'm on the side
of Holy Mother Church.

02:16:17.080 --> 02:16:18.210
You have a sword?

02:16:20.420 --> 02:16:21.420
Quite a few.

02:16:21.580 --> 02:16:23.880
Didn't you also carry a banner?

02:16:24.590 --> 02:16:25.590
Yes.

02:16:25.630 --> 02:16:28.720
Which do you prefer?
Your banner or your sword?

02:16:28.970 --> 02:16:31.300
I was 40 times more fond of my banner.

02:16:31.510 --> 02:16:34.309
Why? Did it have some
particular value or power?

02:16:35.639 --> 02:16:36.680
No.

02:16:39.389 --> 02:16:41.059
It's just, a sword is a weapon.

02:16:41.270 --> 02:16:42.270
And?

02:16:44.730 --> 02:16:47.440
And so I prefer my banner.

02:16:47.690 --> 02:16:48.690
Why?

02:16:49.360 --> 02:16:51.660
To avoid killing anyone.

02:16:51.870 --> 02:16:56.450
So if you'd not been carrying your
banner, you'd have killed more people?

02:17:00.040 --> 02:17:02.750
No. Of course not.
I never killed anyone.

02:17:02.920 --> 02:17:07.629
Then perhaps the temptation to kill
would have been stronger...

02:17:07.840 --> 02:17:10.180
too strong perhaps.

02:17:10.469 --> 02:17:13.090
No. I warned the English
to go back home.

02:17:13.299 --> 02:17:15.850
I begged them not to force us to fight.

02:17:16.059 --> 02:17:20.520
We have witnesses who can confirm you
were not always carrying your banner.

02:17:24.809 --> 02:17:26.400
Yes, perhaps.

02:17:26.610 --> 02:17:28.740
Sometimes you carried
just your sword?

02:17:30.490 --> 02:17:32.320
Yes. I don't know.

02:17:32.660 --> 02:17:34.280
Did you use the sword?

02:17:34.530 --> 02:17:36.740
Yes, I used it to...
I held it up...

02:17:36.950 --> 02:17:40.209
You held up your sword
and flourished it about like this!

02:17:40.459 --> 02:17:41.459
I don't remember.

02:17:41.540 --> 02:17:44.379
You were in the battlefield
with your sword...

02:17:44.629 --> 02:17:46.000
waving it about...

02:17:46.209 --> 02:17:48.510
charging against
the enemy, screaming...

02:17:48.709 --> 02:17:50.010
fighting for life...

02:17:50.260 --> 02:17:54.260
and you expect us to believe
that in all this excitement...

02:17:55.680 --> 02:17:59.809
you never killed anyone?

02:18:00.520 --> 02:18:03.350
No. I never killed anyone.

02:18:05.610 --> 02:18:07.070
I can't believe you can lie.

02:18:07.270 --> 02:18:08.270
I'm not lying.

02:18:08.480 --> 02:18:10.400
Leave me alone!
I can't remember.

02:18:10.610 --> 02:18:12.320
I never killed anyone.

02:18:12.570 --> 02:18:14.240
Let me help your memory.

02:18:14.450 --> 02:18:17.080
I don't want to hear!
I didn't kill that man!

02:18:17.280 --> 02:18:18.580
Leave me alone!

02:18:19.040 --> 02:18:21.540
Stop. Stop. I can't remember.

02:18:21.750 --> 02:18:25.879
The battles were confusing! I was only
defending myself as best as I could.

02:18:26.129 --> 02:18:29.959
There was dust and smoke and noise.
I was being attacked on all sides.

02:18:30.170 --> 02:18:34.840
So maybe, perhaps, I fought back.
But it was only to defend myself.

02:18:35.049 --> 02:18:36.760
So your memory's coming back?

02:18:36.969 --> 02:18:37.969
- Yes.
- Good.

02:18:38.010 --> 02:18:42.270
Now, tell me why God let all those
battles happen in the first place.

02:18:42.480 --> 02:18:46.150
He's so powerful.
He's the creator of Heaven and Earth.

02:18:46.400 --> 02:18:49.610
He could easily have stopped
all that blood and misery.

02:18:49.820 --> 02:18:50.820
Why didn't He...

02:18:50.860 --> 02:18:53.570
Is He the one who spread
blood and misery?

02:18:53.780 --> 02:18:56.490
- Is He?
- But He could have stopped it.

02:18:56.910 --> 02:18:58.660
What did He get? Pleasure?

02:18:58.910 --> 02:19:02.410
Pleasure from watching us killing
each other in His name?

02:19:02.620 --> 02:19:05.959
- In His name?
- Yes. In His name.

02:19:06.209 --> 02:19:09.590
We fought and killed in His name,
the King of Heaven!

02:19:09.790 --> 02:19:10.790
Really?

02:19:10.840 --> 02:19:13.340
Let all those who love me, follow me!

02:19:13.549 --> 02:19:18.680
"Let all who love me, follow me!"
Where does God get mentioned?

02:19:18.889 --> 02:19:20.969
Come on, Jeanne.

02:19:21.180 --> 02:19:22.809
Be honest.

02:19:23.100 --> 02:19:25.940
You fought for yourself. In your name.

02:19:27.980 --> 02:19:30.360
I was defending myself
as best as I could.

02:19:30.610 --> 02:19:33.400
Everyone has the right to defend
themselves, don't they?

02:19:33.610 --> 02:19:36.530
They do! Should I have
let myself get killed?

02:19:36.740 --> 02:19:39.490
No. You did fine.
I'd even say well done.

02:19:39.700 --> 02:19:44.830
In fact, the ones you killed
probably deserved it, don't you think?

02:19:45.410 --> 02:19:46.580
No!

02:19:46.790 --> 02:19:47.790
No.

02:19:48.540 --> 02:19:51.420
I never thought killing
would bring about peace.

02:19:51.630 --> 02:19:52.630
I agree.

02:19:52.670 --> 02:19:54.960
Peace will only be got
at the end of a lance.

02:19:55.170 --> 02:19:58.130
I don't agree. Why do you
keep changing your mind?

02:20:00.010 --> 02:20:01.010
You.

02:20:03.060 --> 02:20:04.720
Why are you doing this to me?

02:20:04.970 --> 02:20:06.980
You get pleasure from hurting me?

02:20:08.310 --> 02:20:10.940
Pleasure. That's a difficult
word to define.

02:20:12.320 --> 02:20:15.240
When does the pain end
and the pleasure begin?

02:20:15.440 --> 02:20:18.950
When did your pleasure begin,
with that...

02:20:19.200 --> 02:20:20.870
sword in your hand?

02:20:22.490 --> 02:20:25.200
I never took pleasure...

02:20:25.660 --> 02:20:28.210
in hurting anyone.

02:20:29.420 --> 02:20:30.750
Really?

02:20:56.110 --> 02:20:59.400
Set me free. Set me free.

02:20:59.820 --> 02:21:01.360
You will be, Jeanne.

02:21:02.490 --> 02:21:04.160
You will be.

02:21:25.640 --> 02:21:28.140
Jeanne, my very dear friend
in Christ...

02:21:28.350 --> 02:21:32.770
we, your judges, desirous of
reaching a true and lawful verdict...

02:21:33.020 --> 02:21:37.610
submitted a transcript of your trial
to the University of Paris.

02:21:38.190 --> 02:21:42.530
After careful consideration,
the scholars have concluded with us...

02:21:42.740 --> 02:21:45.620
that you have committed
many grievous sins.

02:21:46.280 --> 02:21:49.410
I ask you to listen carefully
to their opinion...

02:21:49.660 --> 02:21:51.540
as detailed in these articles.

02:21:55.000 --> 02:21:56.090
"Article 1:

02:21:56.340 --> 02:22:00.300
You said that by God's command you have
continually worn men's clothes...

02:22:00.510 --> 02:22:02.550
and you have also
worn your hair short...

02:22:02.760 --> 02:22:05.930
with nothing to distinguish you
from the soldiers.

02:22:06.680 --> 02:22:09.430
As to this article,
the scholars have declared..."

02:22:09.640 --> 02:22:12.350
Don't abandon me. Please.

02:22:14.520 --> 02:22:16.110
Where are You?

02:22:17.650 --> 02:22:19.940
Where are You? Please.

02:22:23.700 --> 02:22:27.740
Is this what You want?
Is this what You want?

02:22:28.240 --> 02:22:29.990
Do You want me to...

02:22:31.000 --> 02:22:32.410
to burn...

02:22:33.500 --> 02:22:35.170
without...

02:22:35.500 --> 02:22:37.380
being confessed?

02:22:38.340 --> 02:22:41.170
Finally, article 12.

02:22:41.380 --> 02:22:43.630
"You have said you won't
submit yourself...

02:22:43.840 --> 02:22:47.180
to the judgement of the church
militant, but only to God."

02:22:47.390 --> 02:22:50.270
The scholars say that you
have no comprehension...

02:22:50.470 --> 02:22:52.310
of the Church's authority...

02:22:52.520 --> 02:22:55.310
that you've perniciously erred
in the faith of God...

02:22:55.560 --> 02:23:00.320
that you're a child of superstition,
a wanderer from the faith...

02:23:00.940 --> 02:23:04.610
an invoker of demons,
an idolater and a heretic.

02:23:15.750 --> 02:23:19.130
We once again admonish,
beg and exalt you...

02:23:19.380 --> 02:23:22.840
to cast out and recant
your erroneous beliefs...

02:23:23.090 --> 02:23:26.180
by signing this recantation.

02:23:27.220 --> 02:23:28.220
Please.

02:23:29.890 --> 02:23:31.390
If the Church...

02:23:32.020 --> 02:23:34.600
wants me to say...

02:23:35.230 --> 02:23:37.440
that my visions are evil...

02:23:37.850 --> 02:23:40.650
then I do not believe
in this Church.

02:23:46.070 --> 02:23:47.780
Perform your office!

02:23:53.290 --> 02:23:54.290
Wait.

02:23:58.960 --> 02:24:01.540
Jeanne, I beg of you, sign.

02:24:02.090 --> 02:24:05.170
Don't you understand?
I'm trying to save you.

02:24:05.380 --> 02:24:07.590
I want to be confessed.

02:24:08.720 --> 02:24:11.350
Sign this and I will
confess you myself.

02:24:16.230 --> 02:24:19.060
And may I go to Mass?

02:24:19.270 --> 02:24:21.110
As often as you like.

02:24:21.310 --> 02:24:24.030
Now, for the love of God, sign.

02:24:29.320 --> 02:24:32.530
Sign, Jeanne, and you'll be
free of your chains.

02:24:32.780 --> 02:24:33.950
Free of the fire.

02:25:10.450 --> 02:25:11.660
Thank you.

02:25:15.370 --> 02:25:17.500
You know what you just signed?

02:25:18.620 --> 02:25:21.040
You just signed away His existence.

02:25:22.580 --> 02:25:23.630
I didn't mean to.

02:25:23.840 --> 02:25:25.460
For you...

02:25:25.840 --> 02:25:27.340
He's a lie.

02:25:28.760 --> 02:25:30.380
An illusion.

02:25:30.970 --> 02:25:35.260
No, no. He told me
that I would be confessed.

02:25:36.180 --> 02:25:39.270
In the end it was you
who abandoned Him.

02:25:44.940 --> 02:25:47.650
May I have that back, please?

02:25:47.820 --> 02:25:49.900
You have nothing to regret.

02:25:50.110 --> 02:25:51.110
No.

02:25:51.360 --> 02:25:52.410
Give it back to me!

02:25:52.610 --> 02:25:53.780
Give it back!

02:25:55.490 --> 02:25:57.080
Take her away!

02:26:01.920 --> 02:26:03.290
Silence her!

02:26:08.210 --> 02:26:09.210
There.

02:26:09.300 --> 02:26:10.470
She has recanted.

02:26:10.670 --> 02:26:12.760
And we accept her repentance...

02:26:12.970 --> 02:26:16.430
for the Church never closes
her arms to those who return to it.

02:26:18.310 --> 02:26:22.390
Now she's your martyr, not ours.

02:26:48.750 --> 02:26:50.510
Please! Please!

02:26:56.890 --> 02:26:57.890
Enough.

02:27:05.560 --> 02:27:06.560
Here.

02:27:07.690 --> 02:27:11.360
If you want to get dressed,
try these for size.

02:27:17.740 --> 02:27:19.160
My lord bishop!

02:27:29.960 --> 02:27:31.710
Come to see for yourself.

02:27:31.960 --> 02:27:33.720
Well, take a look.

02:27:39.350 --> 02:27:41.510
You see? Dressed as a man again.

02:27:42.060 --> 02:27:44.770
Her repentance didn't
last very long, did it?

02:27:45.640 --> 02:27:50.440
The Bishop of Senlis was passing by and
was on hand to witness her relapse.

02:27:52.900 --> 02:27:55.990
And by what miracle did these
clothes get here?

02:27:56.200 --> 02:28:00.370
Not a miracle, my dear Cauchon.
An evil spell.

02:28:00.580 --> 02:28:04.660
This girl is a witch, and tomorrow
she will burn for it.

02:28:05.910 --> 02:28:08.540
Have the stake prepared
in the marketplace.

02:28:24.270 --> 02:28:26.390
Jeanne, I don't understand.

02:28:26.640 --> 02:28:28.140
Why did you do it?

02:28:28.440 --> 02:28:29.440
And you.

02:28:29.690 --> 02:28:31.060
Why did you lie?

02:28:31.770 --> 02:28:33.320
You promised I'd be confessed.

02:28:33.530 --> 02:28:36.530
It was the only way to have you
saved from the fire.

02:28:36.990 --> 02:28:39.990
It's not my body I want to save.

02:28:40.200 --> 02:28:41.660
It's my soul.

02:28:43.450 --> 02:28:45.160
I ask only one thing:

02:28:46.290 --> 02:28:47.460
Please...

02:28:48.330 --> 02:28:49.830
hear my confession.

02:28:53.630 --> 02:28:55.340
I can't, Jeanne.

02:28:56.130 --> 02:28:58.170
I can't hear your confession.

02:29:00.760 --> 02:29:02.180
I'm very sorry.

02:29:23.700 --> 02:29:25.330
You want to confess?

02:29:29.540 --> 02:29:31.000
I'm listening.

02:29:32.210 --> 02:29:34.420
I've committed sins, my Lord.

02:29:37.630 --> 02:29:39.380
So many sins.

02:29:43.010 --> 02:29:44.260
I saw...

02:29:44.970 --> 02:29:46.810
so many signs.

02:29:47.020 --> 02:29:48.980
Many signs.

02:29:50.980 --> 02:29:53.190
The ones I wanted to see.

02:29:59.070 --> 02:30:01.860
I fought...

02:30:04.740 --> 02:30:06.450
out of revenge...

02:30:09.700 --> 02:30:11.210
and despair.

02:30:18.670 --> 02:30:20.380
I was all the things...

02:30:21.670 --> 02:30:23.680
that people believe...

02:30:25.640 --> 02:30:27.640
they are allowed to be...

02:30:29.220 --> 02:30:31.020
when they're fighting for...

02:30:35.020 --> 02:30:36.190
a cause.

02:30:37.440 --> 02:30:38.610
For a cause.

02:30:40.990 --> 02:30:42.240
I was...

02:30:44.990 --> 02:30:46.240
proud...

02:30:53.040 --> 02:30:54.290
and stubborn.

02:30:54.920 --> 02:30:56.000
Selfish.

02:30:57.500 --> 02:30:59.000
Selfish.

02:31:00.590 --> 02:31:01.970
Cruel.

02:31:04.840 --> 02:31:06.010
Yes.

02:31:06.640 --> 02:31:07.970
Cruel.

02:31:10.600 --> 02:31:13.140
You think you are ready now?

02:31:17.730 --> 02:31:19.070
Yes.

02:31:20.900 --> 02:31:22.490
Good.
