02:21.750 --> 02:26.253
It is urgent... repeat: urgent...
that you give the sheriff a call.

02:26.337 --> 02:28.630
I say again, Coogan,
call the sheriff.

02:28.715 --> 02:32.176
It is urgent... repeat: urgent...
that you call the sheriff...

05:31.689 --> 05:33.774
Put your pants on, Chief.

09:15.955 --> 09:18.331
Mm... Coogan.

09:18.416 --> 09:20.500
Mm-hm.

09:23.671 --> 09:26.298
- He still in Phoenix?
- Mm-hm.

09:27.175 --> 09:29.718
- Expecting anyone else?
- Mm-mm.

09:34.265 --> 09:36.266
What the hell's that?

09:39.061 --> 09:41.146
Oh. Prisoner.

09:41.230 --> 09:44.441
- Uh-huh? What'd he do?
- Just killed a woman.

09:44.525 --> 09:46.610
Just his wife, that's all.

09:47.111 --> 09:48.778
Uh-uh.

10:07.340 --> 10:09.466
How long you been trackin' him?

10:09.550 --> 10:11.635
Three days.

10:11.719 --> 10:13.803
You need a bath.

10:16.849 --> 10:18.934
- After.
- Now.

10:19.560 --> 10:21.645
- Now?
- Uh-huh.

10:22.772 --> 10:24.856
Hm.

10:31.864 --> 10:33.949
Stop!

10:36.994 --> 10:39.412
What the hell for?

10:40.957 --> 10:43.041
Back it up!

10:53.636 --> 10:55.178
Go on in!

11:03.646 --> 11:08.108
- Need a bigger target?
- There ain't none in this county, baby.

11:10.653 --> 11:15.240
When I assign a deputy to a roadblock, I
expect him to be there when I come back.

11:15.324 --> 11:17.576
- Mornin', Sheriff.
- Millie.

11:18.244 --> 11:21.621
Ever cross your mind I might
accidentally know what I'm doin'?

11:21.706 --> 11:23.707
You mind handin' me the soap?

11:28.546 --> 11:33.466
Direct disobedience to orders, dereliction
of duty, leaving an assigned post.

11:33.551 --> 11:35.802
Those are the first
three I think of.

11:35.886 --> 11:39.472
- The fugitive's on the porch.
- I saw him. That's just one thing more.

11:39.557 --> 11:41.308
Get my back, will you?

11:41.392 --> 11:44.894
That's a prisoner out there. Not
an animal to be tethered to a rail.

11:44.979 --> 11:47.439
- My shirt's in there on the bed.
- For what?

11:47.523 --> 11:51.610
- The badge on it comes right off.
- You wanna play the lonesome boy, fine!

11:51.694 --> 11:55.905
You'll get a gutful. Every lousy
one-man job that comes along.

11:56.407 --> 12:00.118
- Got one waiting for you right now.
- That so?

12:00.202 --> 12:04.623
Be in front of my desk in one hour.
Don't bother to stand up and salute.

12:07.209 --> 12:09.294
One hour!

12:37.948 --> 12:40.033
Texas?

12:40.117 --> 12:42.202
Arizona.

12:43.037 --> 12:45.121
My home town.

12:46.499 --> 12:49.751
- Business trip?
- You might call it that.

12:51.671 --> 12:54.172
- Rancher?
- Deputy sheriff.

12:55.049 --> 12:59.844
- Is that right? May I ask what you're...
- Extraditing a fugitive.

12:59.929 --> 13:03.348
One of your cowboys step
outta line in our fair city?

13:03.432 --> 13:06.017
No. One of your boys
stepped outta line in ours.

13:33.879 --> 13:36.131
Head of the line, cowboy.

13:36.966 --> 13:39.050
- That's luggage.
- What?

13:39.552 --> 13:43.972
- That thing in your hand, that's luggage.
- So, it's luggage.

13:44.056 --> 13:46.933
So it's 50 cents extra
for a piece of luggage.

13:50.104 --> 13:52.188
Where to, cowboy?

13:57.278 --> 14:00.405
177 East 104th Street.

14:23.679 --> 14:27.557
- You from Texas?
- Arizona.

14:28.058 --> 14:31.519
- You with the rodeo?
- Nope.

14:33.105 --> 14:35.523
Everybody wear them
clothes in Arizona?

14:37.693 --> 14:41.446
No. Lifeguards wear swim trunks.
Nurses wear white dresses.

14:42.031 --> 14:44.115
What do they wear here?

14:59.215 --> 15:01.633
That's $2.95,
including the luggage.

15:04.094 --> 15:07.806
Tell me, how many stores are there
named Bloomingdale's in this town?

15:07.890 --> 15:12.143
- One. Why?
- We passed it twice.

15:13.395 --> 15:16.231
It's still $2.95
including the luggage.

15:16.857 --> 15:18.483
Yeah.

15:18.567 --> 15:21.945
Well, there's three dollars,
including the tip.

15:32.456 --> 15:34.707
Oh, sure, you want him arrested.

15:34.792 --> 15:38.711
What's gonna happen when we get
him downtown? I'll tell ya what.

15:38.796 --> 15:43.216
You'll say it was a big mistake and swear
you fell downstairs, just like last time.

15:43.300 --> 15:45.760
But when he's arrested,
I feel sorry.

15:45.845 --> 15:47.804
Look, Mrs Amador...

15:47.888 --> 15:50.849
- You want something?
- Deputy Coogan.

15:51.058 --> 15:54.727
- Is that the whole thing?
- I'm looking for a Lieutenant McElroy.

15:54.812 --> 15:56.521
Up the stairs.

15:56.605 --> 16:00.608
Now, look. Mrs Amador, why
don't you just divorce the bum?

16:00.693 --> 16:03.027
- I cannot do that!
- You got to!

16:03.112 --> 16:05.947
How can I divorce?
We're not married.

16:11.579 --> 16:15.790
Up there, stickin' yourself
in the arm with that poison?

16:19.461 --> 16:21.754
Soliciting what?

16:21.839 --> 16:26.175
Look, Officer, when a lady can't
adjust her stockings, the world's...

16:26.260 --> 16:28.303
Hey, Slim!

16:28.387 --> 16:32.599
Sir, Third Avenue's a public street.
We've got as much right to as anybody...

16:36.186 --> 16:39.564
- Get "her."
- Look at all that, in two-inch heels!

16:39.648 --> 16:43.151
Do you work out? Do you?

16:43.235 --> 16:44.903
Come in!

16:44.987 --> 16:47.405
We got no chance
of getting a conviction.

16:47.489 --> 16:49.866
- I got a confession!
- Be right with you.

16:49.950 --> 16:52.493
Look, do you read?
Do you take a morning paper?

16:52.578 --> 16:55.955
There's such a thing as a supreme court.
Did you ever hear of it?

16:56.040 --> 16:59.167
You can be damn sure
DiBlasio's lawyer has.

16:59.251 --> 17:02.128
- What's your problem?
- My name's Coogan.

17:02.212 --> 17:03.379
So?

17:03.464 --> 17:06.590
You got a James Ringerman here
you're holding for me?

17:06.675 --> 17:09.969
Oh, yeah. Deputy sheriff,
Texas, right?

17:11.305 --> 17:15.599
- Arizona. I have the papers for him here.
- I'm sure you do. Leave your number...

17:15.684 --> 17:17.977
- Should I spring DiBlasio?
- No, hold him...

17:20.731 --> 17:23.107
Lieutenant McElroy here.

17:23.192 --> 17:26.903
No. Hold him until I check with
the district attorney's office.

17:26.987 --> 17:28.154
- You got it?
- Yes.

17:28.238 --> 17:30.156
What number?

17:30.240 --> 17:32.784
Your phone number,
hotel where you're staying.

17:32.868 --> 17:36.204
- I'm not staying anyplace.
- Well, find yourself a place.

17:36.288 --> 17:39.499
- Ringerman's not ready.
- Oh? Why not?

17:40.376 --> 17:43.252
He took a little trip.

17:43.837 --> 17:47.757
Look, I understood that you were
holding him in custody here for me.

17:48.509 --> 17:52.011
An LSD trip. He's in the
prison ward at Bellevue.

17:52.638 --> 17:53.680
In jail?

17:53.764 --> 17:57.475
- Do you want a written report?
- Without the search.

17:57.559 --> 17:58.977
Yes, sir.

17:59.061 --> 18:01.354
How did he get this LSD in jail?

18:01.438 --> 18:05.358
We serve it every day like
peanuts at the cocktail hour.

18:05.442 --> 18:07.235
Lieutenant McElroy.

18:07.319 --> 18:08.361
No.

18:08.445 --> 18:11.614
- Because I said no, that's all.
- Uh... Lieutenant...

18:11.699 --> 18:15.910
I want everybody to feel free to just
come bustin' in here night and day.

18:15.995 --> 18:19.789
- It's Mrs Fowler.
- Oh, yeah.

18:19.873 --> 18:22.417
- I wanted to talk to you.
- Look, Lieutenant...

18:22.501 --> 18:25.795
You can't make out a rape
complaint and then just take off.

18:25.879 --> 18:28.339
We've got an APB out for that guy.

18:28.424 --> 18:30.591
The streets aren't
safe in this town.

18:30.676 --> 18:33.886
Uh... Fowler. That's it. Fowler.

18:33.971 --> 18:37.056
- When does he get out of the hospital?
- Hm? Who?

18:37.141 --> 18:42.020
- Ringerman! Who are we talkin' about?
- When the doctor says he can get out.

18:42.104 --> 18:45.356
- Take a few days, see the town.
- I've already seen the town.

18:45.441 --> 18:49.986
You like orange juice? You'll love
Broadway. Ask anybody where it is.

18:51.030 --> 18:53.948
You made another rape
complaint four months ago.

18:54.700 --> 18:56.325
"Attempted" rape.

18:59.663 --> 19:02.915
And I sent a detective up
to talk to you at the time.

19:03.542 --> 19:06.544
"He" tried to rape me, too.

19:08.714 --> 19:11.382
Did "I" ever try to rape you?

19:13.844 --> 19:17.138
- Get her outta here!
- Lady, you need a psychiatrist.

19:17.222 --> 19:19.640
I went to one and he
tried to rape me, too.

19:19.725 --> 19:21.809
Out, out!

19:24.605 --> 19:27.023
You still here?

19:27.107 --> 19:31.277
Look, Lieutenant. Suppose, um...

19:31.361 --> 19:35.948
Suppose I sign a receipt for the prisoner.
Then he'd be my responsibility, right?

19:36.033 --> 19:39.786
Look, Tex, the only way you'll ever
lay your hands on James Ringerman

19:39.870 --> 19:42.914
is if a New York State judge
renders him into your custody.

19:42.998 --> 19:46.334
You can't think about that
until he's released from Bellevue.

19:46.418 --> 19:48.753
- When will that be?
- A week, a month?

19:48.837 --> 19:52.381
How the hell do I know?
I'm no doctor.

19:52.466 --> 19:54.383
Lieutenant McElroy.

19:54.468 --> 19:57.178
Don't call us, we'll call you.

19:58.013 --> 20:00.556
Huh? Yeah. I got it
right here on my desk.

20:03.227 --> 20:07.522
Sorry I'm late. I'm Julie Roth,
your sister's probation officer.

20:10.150 --> 20:14.695
- How come you never been to the place?
- I've been there lots. You're never home.

20:14.780 --> 20:17.281
Come up some night,
I'll show you the roof.

20:17.366 --> 20:19.450
I've seen a roof.

20:20.911 --> 20:22.995
Hey, that I like.

20:25.791 --> 20:29.544
You know somethin'?
You're pretty good-looking for a cop.

20:29.628 --> 20:31.379
Thank you.

20:31.463 --> 20:35.967
Next you're gonna ask me if I make it
with all the good-looking fuzz here.

20:36.051 --> 20:39.387
Well, the answer is no,
not all of them.

20:39.888 --> 20:45.143
Nothing you say or do will shock or
upset me, so let's cut out the nonsense.

20:48.814 --> 20:51.107
What do you know!
I can feel your heart.

20:51.191 --> 20:53.276
OK, Joe, you've shown me.

20:55.654 --> 20:57.989
Wow, feel that thing beat.

20:58.407 --> 21:01.200
Joe, will you please keep
your hands to yourself.

21:01.535 --> 21:04.328
Tick, tick, tick.

21:04.454 --> 21:07.165
Guess you didn't hear the lady,
did you, boy?

21:07.541 --> 21:11.210
Cool it, cowboy. There's plenty
here for both of us, huh?

21:12.880 --> 21:16.549
Tick, tick, tick.

21:22.306 --> 21:25.850
What the hell do you think you're
doing? And who are you, anyway?

21:25.934 --> 21:29.896
- I'm a cop, lady, just like you are.
- I don't happen to be a cop.

21:30.731 --> 21:32.565
- Are you all right, Joe?
- Yeah.

21:32.649 --> 21:33.941
Let me see.

21:34.026 --> 21:39.155
Look, I'm a stranger in town, ma'am. I'm
not from Texas. Arizona. I just thought...

21:39.239 --> 21:41.449
There was no need for violence.

21:41.533 --> 21:44.619
Well, yeah. I can see that now.
I'm sorry about that.

21:44.703 --> 21:48.039
- I think you should apologise.
- OK, ma'am, I apologise.

21:48.123 --> 21:51.042
- Not to me! To him!
- Now, wait just a minute.

21:51.168 --> 21:53.252
No, I don't want no apologies.

21:54.671 --> 21:56.839
Just keep that creep
away from me, huh?

21:56.924 --> 21:58.716
Joe...

21:58.800 --> 22:01.302
Joe! Joe!

22:05.015 --> 22:07.225
Thanks.

22:08.685 --> 22:11.854
Do you know how long
it's taken me to find that boy?

22:11.939 --> 22:14.273
- I'll be glad to go get him for you.
- No.

22:14.358 --> 22:18.402
- I'll be glad to bring him back, really.
- By the scruff of the neck?

22:19.279 --> 22:21.781
And we wonder why
these kids hate cops.

22:25.953 --> 22:28.996
Found something about New York
you like, Tex?

22:30.832 --> 22:34.502
He just calls me that.
Really my name is Coogan.

22:34.586 --> 22:36.754
If I fouled things up for you,
I'm sorry.

22:36.838 --> 22:39.632
- I just thought...
- Did you? Think?

22:40.342 --> 22:42.301
Well, yeah. I just...

22:42.386 --> 22:45.805
We don't treat people like that
in New York, Mr Coogan.

22:45.889 --> 22:48.474
- How do you treat 'em?
- I doubt it'd interest you.

22:48.558 --> 22:51.519
- Try me.
- It's a long story.

22:51.603 --> 22:53.688
I just happen to have some time.

22:54.231 --> 22:55.940
Here.

22:56.566 --> 23:01.070
Maybe you know a nice little place
we can have lunch and talk about it.

23:01.154 --> 23:03.614
Sorry, Mr Coogan.
You're not my type.

23:03.699 --> 23:05.783
How can you tell?

23:06.910 --> 23:11.163
- The hat, maybe.
- Oh, that? That comes right off.

23:13.667 --> 23:16.419
Are you dense, or just stubborn?

23:17.379 --> 23:19.297
Hungry mostly.

23:19.381 --> 23:21.465
Come on.

23:22.301 --> 23:27.179
You know, I'm always interested
in new techniques.

23:39.109 --> 23:41.444
Psychophysiological, hm?

23:41.862 --> 23:44.196
It's a branch of psychology
that deals with

23:44.281 --> 23:47.658
the fundamental relationships
between mind and body.

23:47.743 --> 23:51.078
So it's psychophysiological
autogenesis.

23:51.455 --> 23:53.539
Alphagenics for short.

23:53.623 --> 23:55.750
- Alphagenic?
- Mm.

23:58.503 --> 24:01.339
I've been experimenting
with it up at my place...

24:01.423 --> 24:04.467
- You live near here?
- Not far.

24:05.177 --> 24:07.803
You do this experiment
at your house, hm?

24:07.971 --> 24:12.558
Oh, yes, it's much better there. It's
warm and informal. At the precinct...

24:12.642 --> 24:15.223
Seems like an interesting setup.
In fact...

24:15.249 --> 24:16.128
Thank you.

24:16.188 --> 24:18.356
- What do you want?
- Your check, sir.

24:18.440 --> 24:21.484
- Yeah, I saw it.
- Oh, it is getting late.

24:21.568 --> 24:23.736
Why don't you just run along, huh?

24:24.821 --> 24:27.073
- Yes, sir.
- Waiter, just a minute.

24:28.617 --> 24:30.951
It's after three.
I have to be going.

24:34.164 --> 24:37.041
- What are you doin'?
- Dutch.

24:37.125 --> 24:41.045
- You're the girl, aren't you?
- There have been rumours to that effect.

24:41.129 --> 24:44.006
Well, you just sit back
and act like one.

24:45.008 --> 24:46.467
How?

24:46.551 --> 24:48.969
Take everything you can get,
that's how.

24:49.721 --> 24:52.098
Is that the way the
girls act in Arizona?

24:52.724 --> 24:56.102
That's the way everybody
acts everywhere.

24:56.186 --> 24:58.270
You too?

24:59.189 --> 25:02.608
- Especially me.
-  Thank you.

25:03.985 --> 25:06.070
You're welcome.

25:14.663 --> 25:16.831
Thank you.

25:16.915 --> 25:18.999
You're welcome.

25:21.711 --> 25:25.631
- Uh... I'll take my bag.
- That's all right. I'll carry it.

25:25.715 --> 25:28.717
- But I have to go now.
- Fine. Where to?

25:28.802 --> 25:31.679
You don't understand.
I have a dozen things to do.

25:31.763 --> 25:35.641
- Good. I'll help you.
- But I'll be all day and half the night.

25:36.726 --> 25:38.811
I've got nothing but time.

25:47.654 --> 25:50.448
I wouldn't get too
comfortable, Mr Coogan.

25:51.199 --> 25:53.701
Nobody calls me "Mr"
with my boots off.

25:57.122 --> 25:59.206
I don't know your first name.

25:59.291 --> 26:02.084
How about just Coogan,
without the "Mr"?

26:05.714 --> 26:07.798
Julie.

26:16.641 --> 26:18.851
I don't remember telling you mine.

26:20.312 --> 26:23.772
Yeah, well,
that's my police trainin'.

26:25.108 --> 26:26.942
Po-lice trainin'?

26:27.527 --> 26:29.904
Yeah.

26:30.572 --> 26:32.823
See, it's on your magazines here.

26:32.908 --> 26:35.743
Name and address
of the subscription.

26:45.295 --> 26:47.379
How are you?

26:48.507 --> 26:51.342
I thought you wanted
to learn about alphagenics.

26:51.426 --> 26:54.345
Oh, I do. I do.

26:55.055 --> 26:57.139
Good.

27:04.147 --> 27:06.232
My files.

27:07.526 --> 27:09.777
I only handle young,
single girls.

27:11.696 --> 27:13.447
Yeah.

27:13.532 --> 27:15.616
Me too.

27:22.707 --> 27:24.792
Now, briefly...

27:25.502 --> 27:28.587
autogenesis is basically
a programme of...

27:29.673 --> 27:31.924
self-regeneration,

27:32.008 --> 27:35.261
- the main point of attack being the...
- What?

27:35.345 --> 27:38.013
core of self-contempt

27:38.098 --> 27:40.266
that is always a principal factor.

27:43.603 --> 27:45.646
This we do by means...

27:45.730 --> 27:48.357
of a tape recorder,

27:48.441 --> 27:50.526
which is right here.

27:52.362 --> 27:56.156
The programme is based on behavioural
psychological principles,

27:56.241 --> 28:00.327
the position being that all
human and animal response...

28:01.288 --> 28:03.872
is the result of...

28:03.957 --> 28:06.041
conditioned reflex...

28:07.127 --> 28:13.632
which, as you know, is simply
a particular bodily response...

28:15.260 --> 28:17.344
to a particular...

28:19.055 --> 28:21.140
stimulus.

28:26.771 --> 28:29.064
- Phone.
- Forget it.

28:39.367 --> 28:41.452
Hello?

28:41.536 --> 28:43.621
Yes, this is she. Who?

28:45.582 --> 28:47.207
Laura!

28:47.292 --> 28:49.376
It's one of my girls.

28:50.003 --> 28:51.962
Yes?

28:52.047 --> 28:54.131
Oh, not him again.

28:55.008 --> 28:59.928
Now, you know that the terms of your
probation specifically stated that...

29:00.764 --> 29:02.848
Well, of course it's difficult.

29:04.601 --> 29:07.227
I understand that
better than you think.

29:09.356 --> 29:12.066
Well, yes, he's...

29:12.150 --> 29:14.693
You can always say no,
can't you?

29:14.778 --> 29:16.862
No.

29:19.741 --> 29:22.159
All right. Fine.

29:22.243 --> 29:24.328
I'll expect you in five minutes.

29:29.209 --> 29:31.126
Five minutes.

29:34.506 --> 29:36.590
Yeah.

29:50.355 --> 29:52.481
Five minutes.

31:00.341 --> 31:02.426
- Yeah?
- Single.

31:03.762 --> 31:05.804
How long you gonna be staying?

31:05.889 --> 31:08.474
No longer than I can help it.

31:08.558 --> 31:11.351
All right. Room 304.

31:12.145 --> 31:14.229
That'll be $7, in advance.

31:15.148 --> 31:19.026
- The sign says five.
- Seven without luggage.

31:23.198 --> 31:24.823
That ain't luggage.

31:24.908 --> 31:27.576
A cab driver in this town'd
give you an argument.

31:27.660 --> 31:31.413
- Do you want the room or not?
- No, no, I'll take it.

31:50.391 --> 31:52.476
Excuse me, sir.

31:56.189 --> 31:58.273
After you, sir.

32:03.363 --> 32:07.407
- You really hit the jackpot tonight, sir.
- Yeah.

32:07.492 --> 32:11.495
Fell right into it and came up
with a rose in your nose.

32:11.579 --> 32:13.956
A lonesome lady
just down the hall.

32:14.040 --> 32:16.959
I think she was stood
up on a date tonight.

32:17.669 --> 32:21.630
And beautiful.
I mean, all the tools.

32:21.714 --> 32:24.091
So long.

32:24.175 --> 32:26.343
No trouble to give a
knock on the door.

32:26.427 --> 32:28.512
So long, buddy.

32:50.076 --> 32:52.160
Hi.

32:53.079 --> 32:55.163
Help a lady in distress?

32:58.793 --> 33:01.086
Wrong room.

33:16.853 --> 33:20.647
I'm a girl who never had trouble
with a zipper in her life...

33:21.190 --> 33:23.650
until tonight.

33:23.735 --> 33:26.111
Be an angel man.

33:27.155 --> 33:29.239
Up or down?

33:30.366 --> 33:34.328
Well, let's put it this way, sport:
you're drivin'.

33:37.206 --> 33:39.041
Out.

33:39.125 --> 33:41.209
What's the matter?

33:44.088 --> 33:48.133
- Are you some kind of religious fanatic?
- Come on, out.

33:48.217 --> 33:51.136
All right, you cheap bum.
Who needs your lousy action?

33:51.220 --> 33:53.305
Hold on a minute.

34:08.696 --> 34:10.405
Texas faggot!

34:27.882 --> 34:30.509
You Texas boys get up early.

34:30.592 --> 34:32.719
It's Arizona.

34:32.804 --> 34:37.306
And I figured I'd better get here
before the cuckoos start gatherin'.

34:37.391 --> 34:39.601
What do you want?

34:39.686 --> 34:41.978
Ringerman... now.

34:45.190 --> 34:47.275
You've got a problem.

34:48.695 --> 34:50.779
You don't listen.

34:52.614 --> 34:54.157
Number one.

34:54.242 --> 34:56.792
First you go down to the
district attorney's office

34:56.818 --> 34:58.603
where they check your papers.

34:58.663 --> 35:02.666
The affidavit of flight, request
for extradition, and so forth.

35:03.376 --> 35:04.835
Number two.

35:04.919 --> 35:08.630
Then you go down to the Supreme
Court of the State of New York,

35:08.715 --> 35:12.884
where Judge Acosta renders
the fugitive into your custody.

35:14.387 --> 35:16.388
But you can't do anything

35:16.472 --> 35:21.435
until they release Ringerman from
the prison ward at Bellevue. OK?

35:28.693 --> 35:31.820
- You could get him.
- I'm a busy man.

35:32.071 --> 35:34.406
You could walk right in
and get him for me.

35:34.615 --> 35:39.828
Tex, you're getting on my nerves. What
gives with you people? Too much sun?

35:40.955 --> 35:45.417
Let's make it simple. Get outta my office
and don't come back until I send for you.

35:47.253 --> 35:49.713
Coogan.
Piute County Sheriff's Office.

35:49.797 --> 35:53.258
Lieutenant McElroy sent me up here
to pick up a James Ringerman.

35:53.342 --> 35:54.968
Ringerman?

35:55.053 --> 35:58.096
Yeah. Said he'd appreciate it
if you'd snap it up a little.

35:58.181 --> 36:02.768
He's parked in the ambulance zone.
The man said he can only stay a second.

36:16.324 --> 36:18.867
If you'd be kind enough
to open this one.

36:18.951 --> 36:21.203
No, not without a medical release.

36:22.246 --> 36:25.957
I understood that medical release
went through last night.

36:26.042 --> 36:27.417
Not listed here.

36:27.502 --> 36:30.170
It probably hasn't reached
this department yet.

36:30.254 --> 36:34.841
If you'll open up here, I can straighten
it out with the doctor right away.

36:34.926 --> 36:37.803
I can't let you through.
He's already got one visitor.

36:37.887 --> 36:39.429
Oh?

36:39.514 --> 36:41.890
- That's it, huh?
- That's it.

36:45.019 --> 36:47.104
What's your name, Officer?

36:48.356 --> 36:51.942
- What for?
- Well, when somebody asks me

36:52.026 --> 36:56.113
why Judge Acosta of the New York State
Supreme Court's been kept waiting,

36:56.322 --> 36:58.406
I gotta give 'em a name.

36:58.491 --> 37:00.992
- Yeah. Now, just a minute...
- Do I get the name

37:01.077 --> 37:04.287
or do I have to have Lieutenant
McElroy come and get it for me?

37:04.372 --> 37:06.790
Just a second!

37:10.795 --> 37:13.505
Everybody tells me
somethin' different.

37:14.257 --> 37:16.341
Rudy!

37:17.593 --> 37:19.678
Take him in to see Ringerman.

37:20.930 --> 37:23.014
You'll call the doc, huh?

37:27.353 --> 37:28.395
Call the doc.

37:28.479 --> 37:30.981
Well, looky, looky, looky!

37:31.065 --> 37:33.942
And they say the West
ain't wild any more!

37:34.026 --> 37:36.111
Hey, if it ain't Hoot Gibson!

37:39.824 --> 37:42.826
<i>♪ Give me a home
where the buffalo roam</i>

37:42.910 --> 37:45.829
<i>♪ And the deer and
the antelope play</i>

37:57.717 --> 38:00.010
Well, well, looky here.

38:00.803 --> 38:03.138
Coogan.

38:03.222 --> 38:06.349
Hey, Linny, say hello to the
fuzz that busted me in Arizona.

38:06.434 --> 38:09.561
Yeah. Man-burger.

38:09.687 --> 38:12.606
Did you come to take
me back, cowboy? Huh?

38:13.316 --> 38:15.400
This cat's got wild vibes.

38:16.235 --> 38:19.279
Hey, man, she's pickin' up
on your vibrations.

38:20.448 --> 38:22.657
You wanna know the thing about me?

38:24.994 --> 38:27.871
I got this little
green worm in my head.

38:30.458 --> 38:32.542
And it glows in the dark.

38:34.712 --> 38:37.505
That's the thing about me.

38:39.050 --> 38:41.635
- I'm Coogan.
- Yes, Rollins told me.

38:41.719 --> 38:43.803
Apparently there's been a mix-up.

38:43.888 --> 38:47.766
- Can he travel?
- How soon were you planning to leave?

38:49.018 --> 38:52.646
I was trying to make a helicopter
in 45 minutes at Pan Am.

38:52.730 --> 38:57.025
- I'd hate to miss that connection.
- Yes, I understand, but...

38:57.109 --> 39:00.862
there's always danger of residual
psychotic reaction to LSD.

39:00.947 --> 39:03.323
He can be trouble.

39:03.407 --> 39:05.617
So can I.

39:07.036 --> 39:10.914
- You travelling alone?
- Just one of him and one of me.

39:12.458 --> 39:14.542
All right, I'll release him.

39:16.087 --> 39:20.715
Put your clothes on, Ringerman.
You're going on another trip.

39:20.800 --> 39:23.301
Give Pushie my regards, huh?
OK?

39:24.428 --> 39:26.513
- OK.
- Yeah.

39:27.890 --> 39:30.433
Does more for me
than a kilo of grass, huh?

39:30.851 --> 39:33.144
Put your pants on, boy.

40:18.774 --> 40:23.528
Will all passengers kindly
proceed to the boarding area. Thank you.

40:24.780 --> 40:27.657
Call for passenger Coogan
on housephone 1G.

40:32.288 --> 40:35.874
- Where are the housephones?
- Back there, sir.

40:47.470 --> 40:50.347
- Coogan here.
- Wrong number.

41:08.783 --> 41:11.868
- Yeah, crazy baby.
- Kill him, Jimmy. Kill him, Jimmy.

41:12.411 --> 41:14.496
Not here! Let's blow!

41:20.961 --> 41:23.546
Green pants, hm?

41:25.591 --> 41:28.426
Green corduroy.
Had a red sweater.

41:28.803 --> 41:31.012
He had a face?

41:31.097 --> 41:33.431
I told you, he was behind me.

41:34.892 --> 41:36.810
Beautiful.

41:37.686 --> 41:40.897
Look, I was on my back
and that's all I saw.

41:43.442 --> 41:46.945
All right. From the top,
let's start again.

41:47.029 --> 41:51.241
From where you bluffed your way
into Ringerman's hospital room.

41:51.951 --> 41:54.285
I haven't left anything out.

41:54.578 --> 41:58.206
- Thing is, I don't know that for sure.
- I told you.

41:58.290 --> 42:01.459
Come back in the morning.
The patient's in need of rest.

42:01.544 --> 42:04.879
- Just a couple more minutes, Doctor.
- All right.

42:04.964 --> 42:07.507
Look, yesterday we had
a prisoner in custody.

42:07.591 --> 42:11.469
Today we've got a fugitive wandering
around with your gun in his pocket.

42:11.554 --> 42:15.098
- Think about it.
- I have been.

42:15.182 --> 42:17.392
We need your cooperation.

42:18.144 --> 42:23.148
What you remember on the plane home
won't help us get Ringerman right now.

42:28.863 --> 42:31.239
I'm not leaving
without that prisoner.

42:31.407 --> 42:34.451
Didn't that whack on the head
teach you anything?

42:34.535 --> 42:39.247
You're in a whole... another kind of
ball game. You're out of your league.

42:39.331 --> 42:42.500
We've got 28,000 cops in the city.
Leave Ringerman to us.

42:43.961 --> 42:46.421
Well, it's gettin' personal now.

42:47.173 --> 42:50.675
Yeah, a man's gotta do
what a man's gotta do.

42:51.302 --> 42:52.180
That it, Wyatt?

42:52.206 --> 42:54.954
That's one way of puttin' it,
Lieutenant.

42:56.432 --> 42:59.476
Well, here's another: forget it.

42:59.560 --> 43:01.836
Understand? That's
not just me talking.

43:01.862 --> 43:04.422
This is from the district
attorney's office.

43:04.482 --> 43:08.818
You are not a policeman in the city
of New York. Am I getting through?

43:08.903 --> 43:12.906
- I still carry a badge.
- In Arizona you're a deputy sheriff!

43:12.990 --> 43:17.160
Here you're just another private
citizen... with a headache.

43:20.164 --> 43:23.458
- I'll be back tomorrow.
- Yeah, you do that.

45:09.648 --> 45:11.733
What do you want?

45:13.110 --> 45:15.820
- Ringerman?
- There's no such person here.

45:15.904 --> 45:19.115
- Police. Open up.
- I gotta see a warrant.

45:20.117 --> 45:22.285
All right!
Will ya wait a minute?!

45:30.836 --> 45:32.920
Upstairs, 25.

45:47.311 --> 45:49.395
Outta the way.

45:56.737 --> 45:58.821
Yeah?

46:00.407 --> 46:02.492
Oh, yeah?

46:02.660 --> 46:04.744
So it's the cops.

46:05.579 --> 46:07.664
Well, let 'em come.

46:17.007 --> 46:20.343
Well, well, well!
What have we got here?

46:20.803 --> 46:23.971
Buffalo Bill with the fancy hat!

46:25.099 --> 46:28.142
And look!
Boots with the pointy toes.

46:29.895 --> 46:32.480
Very fancy.

46:35.526 --> 46:37.694
I'm not impressed.

46:38.404 --> 46:40.905
You Mrs Ringerman?

46:41.865 --> 46:45.284
Come in. Come in, Mr Cowboy.

46:45.911 --> 46:49.664
I got nothin' to hide. I'm not
even asking for a search warrant

46:49.748 --> 46:53.418
cos I got nothin' whatsoever
to hide from nobody.

46:58.799 --> 47:01.175
Welcome to my palace.

47:01.260 --> 47:03.469
Course, the prince just
happens to be out,

47:03.554 --> 47:06.681
but that's cos the police
are just hounding him.

47:08.350 --> 47:11.769
Well, you're very polite,

47:11.854 --> 47:13.938
with your fancy hat in your hand.

47:15.023 --> 47:18.401
At least you know how
to enter a lady's home, anyway.

47:20.654 --> 47:23.448
Where is he, Mrs Ringerman?

47:23.532 --> 47:28.286
You outta your head? I should tell
you so you take him back to jail?

47:28.746 --> 47:30.913
You're talkin' to his mother.

47:31.457 --> 47:33.541
Let me show you somethin'.

47:35.627 --> 47:37.712
Just look what I got in here.

47:40.799 --> 47:42.675
Look at this.

47:42.760 --> 47:46.888
Genuine sterling
silver dinnerware.

47:46.972 --> 47:49.056
My son gave it to me.

47:49.641 --> 47:54.145
And look at this.
Hand-painted imported oil painting.

47:54.229 --> 47:58.149
Gifts! Gifts from a
son to his mother.

47:58.233 --> 48:01.986
And look.
How many mothers do you know...

48:02.070 --> 48:04.280
Just look at this.

48:04.364 --> 48:06.449
A fur coat he got for me.

48:07.910 --> 48:11.537
- How?
- How? He went to the store.

48:11.622 --> 48:14.248
Was it open for business?

48:18.378 --> 48:21.798
You try to be nice.
So what do you get?

48:21.882 --> 48:23.966
Fancy remarks.

48:26.470 --> 48:30.348
Maybe you've been here
long enough, Mr Cowboy.

48:31.350 --> 48:35.102
Look, Mrs Ringerman, I just
wanna take him back for trial.

48:35.896 --> 48:37.980
Oh, yeah?

48:39.107 --> 48:42.985
I don't usually make
no deals with cops.

48:43.737 --> 48:46.197
Be smart if you did.

48:47.157 --> 48:51.160
Smart? Smartness is one thing.

48:51.954 --> 48:53.913
Motherhood's another.

48:55.833 --> 48:56.958
Motherhood?

48:57.042 --> 49:02.004
That's what you're talkin' to,
Mr Cowboy: motherhood.

49:15.018 --> 49:19.272
- He does all right, doesn't he?
- 24 hours, the phone never stops.

49:21.859 --> 49:25.653
- A nice motorcycle.
- Bought and paid for with his own money.

49:25.904 --> 49:28.155
You wanna see his owner's licence?

49:29.032 --> 49:31.284
No.

49:32.536 --> 49:37.957
- Pretty.
- Yeah. Linny Raven. That's her name.

49:38.041 --> 49:40.459
A certified ding-dong.

49:45.048 --> 49:47.133
Raven, huh?

49:52.097 --> 49:54.473
OK, Mrs Ringerman.

49:54.558 --> 49:56.642
Thank you for the visit.

49:57.477 --> 49:59.437
Is that all?

49:59.521 --> 50:03.816
Hey, wait a minute! You think you
can come in here, write down a name

50:03.901 --> 50:06.903
and put on that fancy
hat and just go?

50:06.987 --> 50:09.071
You know what you are?

50:11.408 --> 50:12.950
Fancy.

50:13.035 --> 50:15.912
You smart-ass cowboy cop!

50:15.996 --> 50:18.831
I hope you break both legs!

50:35.223 --> 50:38.184
- What's goin' on here?
- You're under arrest.

50:39.978 --> 50:42.939
- What's the charge?
- Impersonating an officer.

51:09.049 --> 51:11.467
I wake up stinkin' like a goat.

51:11.551 --> 51:13.803
No bath.
Couldn't even take a shave.

51:13.887 --> 51:15.554
Cockroaches.

51:15.639 --> 51:19.266
- And now because of you, for what?
- You've met Sergeant Wallace.

51:19.351 --> 51:22.687
Do you know what it means when
you've got a stakeout established

51:22.771 --> 51:26.983
and some rockhead walks in
and blows it... Oh, damn!

51:27.067 --> 51:29.652
Where do you come off, anyway?

51:29.736 --> 51:32.321
This isn't the OK
Corral around here.

51:32.990 --> 51:35.783
This is the city of New York!
We've got a system!

51:35.909 --> 51:38.828
Not much, but we're fond of it.

51:38.912 --> 51:44.125
We don't like it when a two-for-a-nickel
cowboy tries to bend it out of shape.

51:44.209 --> 51:46.335
Are you chargin' me or what?

51:46.420 --> 51:48.504
You blew a stakeout!

51:49.548 --> 51:54.385
It involved a lot of time and trouble
and discomfort for Sergeant Wallace.

51:54.469 --> 51:56.345
You thought Ringerman'd go there?

51:56.430 --> 51:58.723
- It has happened.
- Not with him it wouldn't.

51:58.807 --> 52:01.517
Where does it say you're
an expert on Ringerman?

52:01.601 --> 52:06.522
I tracked him down for eight days. You
learn a lot about a person hunting him.

52:06.606 --> 52:10.109
- Like what?
- Like that he's not a fool, that's what.

52:10.318 --> 52:12.903
Then how in the hell
did "you" collar him?

52:12.988 --> 52:16.615
If you'd asked us about Mrs Ringerman,
we'd have told you she's a nut!

52:16.700 --> 52:19.160
There's no point in
going up there to see her.

52:19.244 --> 52:21.662
I wanted her out so I
could look the place over.

52:21.830 --> 52:25.708
- She wasn't going anyplace.
- There's a good chance she would have.

52:25.792 --> 52:28.002
Why?

52:28.086 --> 52:32.465
The same way an animal leaves a nest
in another direction... to throw you off.

52:32.549 --> 52:35.092
Well, what do you know!
Woodcraft!

52:36.261 --> 52:38.429
It's the one merit badge I missed.

52:38.513 --> 52:41.182
That's too bad.
You might have learned something.

52:41.266 --> 52:42.892
About what?

52:42.976 --> 52:47.188
About animals. People. They don't act
much different when you're hunting 'em.

52:47.272 --> 52:49.356
Hold it.

52:50.150 --> 52:52.234
This came for you.

53:05.207 --> 53:07.291
Which makes it unanimous.

53:07.375 --> 53:09.794
I took the liberty.

53:09.878 --> 53:12.588
You're on flight number 73, TWA.

53:12.672 --> 53:15.049
Leaves at 4.15pm.

53:15.133 --> 53:17.843
They'd like you there
a half-hour earlier.

53:21.056 --> 53:22.932
I'll think about that.

53:23.016 --> 53:25.434
Coogan.

53:25.519 --> 53:28.229
I'm through messin'
around with you.

53:28.313 --> 53:32.483
Obstructing justice is a
one-to-five felony. Forget Ringerman.

53:33.443 --> 53:36.946
If I even suspect you're nosin'
around between now and plane time,

53:37.030 --> 53:40.908
I'll throw you in the can so fast,
it'll make your nose bleed!

53:49.668 --> 53:52.795
- What happened in there?
- Nothin' much.

53:52.879 --> 53:56.215
Didn't you get taken off
the Ringerman case?

53:56.299 --> 53:59.051
News travels fast
around here, doesn't it?

53:59.136 --> 54:02.012
I was in the room
when McElroy called Arizona.

54:02.097 --> 54:06.392
Yeah, old Sheriff McCrea must have
really enjoyed that phone call.

54:06.476 --> 54:08.477
He doesn't like you?

54:08.562 --> 54:10.646
Oh, he likes me some of the time.

54:12.399 --> 54:14.900
- Most of the time not.
- Why?

54:16.778 --> 54:20.823
He looks at me, he sees a man
who's gonna take his job some day.

54:21.992 --> 54:23.993
I believe it.

54:24.077 --> 54:27.663
There's the Cloisters.
Would you like to go through it?

54:35.755 --> 54:38.382
"No, thank you, Julie.
Some other time."

54:43.555 --> 54:46.056
I'm trying to picture
it the way it was.

54:47.017 --> 54:51.020
Just the trees and the river, before
people came along and fouled it all up.

54:51.146 --> 54:55.024
Thinking "He's out there
somewhere"... Ringerman, your prey?

54:55.233 --> 54:57.318
- Right.
- Mm-hm.

54:57.444 --> 54:59.528
Can I tell you something else?

55:00.864 --> 55:02.865
McElroy wasn't just kidding.

55:02.949 --> 55:06.035
He said he'd throw you in jail
and he meant it.

55:06.119 --> 55:09.455
Well, he's just trying to protect you.
Can't you see that?

55:09.539 --> 55:13.626
That's Ringerman's home court out there
and you don't even know the rules.

55:13.960 --> 55:15.836
So...

55:15.921 --> 55:19.590
do yourself a favour and...
stop thinking about him.

55:20.926 --> 55:24.094
- I wasn't.
- Oh? What, then?

55:25.889 --> 55:27.765
Worms.

55:27.849 --> 55:30.976
Little green kind of ones
that glow in the dark.

55:35.315 --> 55:38.067
- Green worms?
- Yeah. Green.

55:40.612 --> 55:42.863
You are so enigmatic.

55:42.948 --> 55:45.032
Enig... what?

55:46.785 --> 55:49.578
It's a word that
keeps coming to mind.

55:49.663 --> 55:51.872
Except it's a phoney.

55:51.957 --> 55:54.166
It is, huh?

55:56.044 --> 55:58.837
There has to be something
more to you besides...

55:58.922 --> 56:01.548
What?

56:01.633 --> 56:05.427
I dunno. Love. Compassion.

56:06.263 --> 56:08.722
Humanity. Capacity for pity.

56:09.599 --> 56:12.017
- Pity?
- Mm. You must have heard of it.

56:12.102 --> 56:15.229
Yeah. What colour is it?

56:15.939 --> 56:17.856
It's no colour!

56:17.941 --> 56:20.526
See? You don't know
what you're talkin' about.

56:20.610 --> 56:23.612
I don't know what "you're"
talking about, that's for sure.

56:23.697 --> 56:26.991
Well, the colour of pity is red.

56:27.867 --> 56:31.954
- Really? Hm.
- Oh, I've seen some once.

56:32.038 --> 56:34.999
- Where?
- It doesn't make any difference.

56:36.918 --> 56:39.420
Oh, I give up on you.
I'm looking for a key.

56:39.504 --> 56:42.047
Lots of luck.
I can't even find the door.

56:42.882 --> 56:45.175
Well...

56:45.260 --> 56:47.970
It was a bus station
in Prescott, Arizona.

56:49.180 --> 56:51.265
It was all over the floor, pity.

56:54.644 --> 56:57.438
This guy felt sorry for a
prisoner he was takin' in.

56:57.522 --> 56:59.690
He let him say
goodbye to his wife.

57:01.026 --> 57:04.361
He ended up with
a six-inch blade in his gut.

57:04.779 --> 57:07.740
The wife had it up her sleeve.
So much for pity.

57:09.534 --> 57:11.618
Who was it?

57:12.996 --> 57:17.249
Aren't we gonna have a spaghetti
dinner, or was that just talk?

57:17.334 --> 57:19.418
It was you, wasn't it?

57:22.255 --> 57:24.340
I'm really ready for spaghetti.

57:26.051 --> 57:29.094
OK. And thank you.

57:29.179 --> 57:31.263
For what?

57:33.516 --> 57:35.601
Just... thank you.

58:03.671 --> 58:06.924
I'll say this. Once you find
a subject that interests you,

58:07.008 --> 58:09.093
you certainly keep after it.

58:11.054 --> 58:13.138
Why not?

58:14.391 --> 58:16.809
I think we better
change the subject.

58:20.939 --> 58:23.023
All righty.

58:24.067 --> 58:26.693
Do you know a girl
named Linny Raven?

58:26.778 --> 58:29.780
Yes, I'm her probation
officer. Why?

58:29.864 --> 58:31.949
I'm just curious, that's all.

58:32.826 --> 58:36.286
That's privileged information,
Coogan. You know that.

58:36.371 --> 58:39.540
You were the one who
wanted to change the subject.

58:53.888 --> 58:55.973
Tell me about Arizona.

58:56.975 --> 58:59.309
Why don't you come
see for yourself?

59:01.354 --> 59:04.690
- Is that an invitation?
- Now, what's it sound like?

59:09.696 --> 59:11.780
Here, I'll give you a hand.

59:17.412 --> 59:20.497
- I just got a picture of that.
- What?

59:20.582 --> 59:25.085
Me galloping up to the old
corral with my sleeping bag.

59:31.885 --> 59:33.969
You might be surprised.

59:36.055 --> 59:37.598
Hm?

59:38.725 --> 59:40.767
At what?

59:40.852 --> 59:43.937
At Arizona.
It's part of the Union now.

59:44.022 --> 59:46.315
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

59:47.817 --> 59:50.944
Electricity, indoor plumbing, TV...
all that.

59:52.155 --> 59:56.992
You wouldn't even have to bring a
sleeping bag. I got all the conveniences.

01:00:01.915 --> 01:00:03.916
And girls?

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:08.086
Yeah, you might see a stray
one of those floatin' around.

01:00:08.171 --> 01:00:10.756
I mean you. Girlfriends.

01:00:10.840 --> 01:00:12.966
I never took a census. Why?

01:00:14.427 --> 01:00:18.597
I don't know. I just judged you
to be rather busy in that area.

01:00:18.681 --> 01:00:20.641
- You did?
- Mm.

01:00:20.850 --> 01:00:25.020
- How about you with men?
- I don't need a census. I can count them.

01:00:25.563 --> 01:00:27.189
You can?

01:00:29.651 --> 01:00:32.194
How did we get back
on this subject?

01:00:35.698 --> 01:00:38.784
It wasn't easy. Just fate.

01:00:45.416 --> 01:00:48.502
- I think you may be right.
- Usually am.

01:00:48.586 --> 01:00:50.671
- Are you?
- Mm-hm.

01:00:57.929 --> 01:01:00.013
Dinner.

01:01:04.561 --> 01:01:06.645
Still running?

01:01:08.731 --> 01:01:12.609
A good spaghetti sauce should
simmer for about three hours.

01:01:12.694 --> 01:01:14.778
Mmm.

01:02:33.441 --> 01:02:35.525
Mm.

01:02:37.862 --> 01:02:42.240
You know, if you have one decent
spark in your whole body, you'd...

01:02:42.325 --> 01:02:46.244
Coogan?

Hey, hey, big man!

Ooooh!

01:05:05.927 --> 01:05:08.929
Ooh, looking for anyone special?

01:05:09.972 --> 01:05:11.434
Linny Raven. Is she around?

01:05:11.460 --> 01:05:14.167
If you're willing to
settle for second best.

01:05:14.227 --> 01:05:16.436
Nirvana City, back room.

01:05:39.377 --> 01:05:46.258
<i>♪ I say love is a
pigeon-toed orange peel</i>

01:05:46.717 --> 01:05:48.802
<i>♪ A pigeon-toed orange peel</i>

01:05:51.430 --> 01:05:53.640
<i>♪ No more, no less</i>

01:05:53.724 --> 01:05:56.726
<i>♪ A pigeon-toed orange peel</i>

01:05:57.019 --> 01:05:59.896
<i>♪ Pigeon-toed orange peel</i>

01:06:01.691 --> 01:06:05.068
<i>♪ And it's real, love is real</i>

01:06:19.834 --> 01:06:24.129
<i>♪ Are you lookin' straight at me

01:06:39.770 --> 01:06:43.273

01:06:46.277 --> 01:06:52.282
<i>♪ I say love is a

01:06:53.034 --> 01:06:55.118
There you go, baby.

01:06:58.497 --> 01:07:01.333
- Linny.
- Who is your friend?

01:07:01.417 --> 01:07:05.253
This is Wonderful Digby
and this is Omega.

01:07:06.088 --> 01:07:08.256
I'm Coogan. Been lookin' for you.

01:07:08.341 --> 01:07:11.051
Yeah, wild.
But we were just about to split.

01:07:13.679 --> 01:07:16.014
Um...

01:07:16.098 --> 01:07:19.017
- I wanna talk to you.
- Hey, Charlie.

01:07:19.727 --> 01:07:20.997
Coogan.

01:07:22.223 --> 01:07:23.689
Coogan.

01:07:24.148 --> 01:07:27.692
112 Ellwood Street.
Way up on the top.

01:07:28.611 --> 01:07:32.072
Yeah, I was already up there.
They told me you were down here.

01:07:32.156 --> 01:07:34.699
Well, try again.

01:07:34.784 --> 01:07:36.868
And wear your boots, cowboy.

01:07:38.579 --> 01:07:41.414
- I'm wearin' 'em right now.
- So you are.

01:07:41.499 --> 01:07:43.583
Hey, Charlie.

01:07:44.377 --> 01:07:48.838
- It's still Coogan.
- It's Charlie.

01:07:48.923 --> 01:07:52.133
As in "Goodbye, Charlie."

01:07:54.011 --> 01:07:58.640
As in "Ladybug, ladybug,
fly away home."

01:07:59.392 --> 01:08:02.268
Look, friends. We wanna be alone.

01:08:03.020 --> 01:08:09.150
- Uh-uh. Go away, Charlie.
- Yeah, while your legs still work.

01:08:14.490 --> 01:08:20.578
All right, now. I don't like violence,
Mr Wonderful... whatever your name is.

01:08:20.912 --> 01:08:24.874
You better drop that blade or you
won't believe what happens next,

01:08:25.501 --> 01:08:28.586
even while it's happenin'.

01:08:32.008 --> 01:08:34.466
The blade.

01:08:37.638 --> 01:08:40.140
It's dropped.

01:09:13.049 --> 01:09:15.216
Would you have?

01:09:15.301 --> 01:09:18.011
Would I have what?

01:09:18.095 --> 01:09:20.596
With the broken bottle?

01:09:20.680 --> 01:09:22.765
Gouged him?

01:09:29.106 --> 01:09:30.774
Hm?

01:09:31.567 --> 01:09:33.651
I don't know. That was up to him.

01:09:42.953 --> 01:09:44.912
Good heavens!

01:09:44.997 --> 01:09:47.040
How's everything in Australia?

01:09:55.841 --> 01:09:58.927
What do you want? Hm?

01:10:02.181 --> 01:10:04.933
Cat got your tongue?

01:10:05.851 --> 01:10:07.185
No.

01:10:09.647 --> 01:10:11.731
Joe Straight.

01:10:16.278 --> 01:10:18.404
What's your bag, Joe?

01:10:18.489 --> 01:10:20.573
Music? Hm?

01:10:31.627 --> 01:10:33.711
No?

01:10:37.133 --> 01:10:39.509
Grass, hm?

01:10:39.593 --> 01:10:42.095
Dig grass? Hm?

01:10:55.234 --> 01:10:57.902
Juice. Hm?

01:10:57.987 --> 01:11:00.071
A drinking man.

01:11:00.906 --> 01:11:02.991
Occasionally.

01:11:18.591 --> 01:11:20.675
Why me, Mr Cowboy?

01:11:22.636 --> 01:11:25.388
Cos I liked what
I saw in the hospital.

01:11:25.472 --> 01:11:27.557
So did I.

01:11:31.645 --> 01:11:35.565
It's what happened afterwards
that I didn't care for too much.

01:11:35.649 --> 01:11:38.359
What are you talking about?

01:11:40.321 --> 01:11:45.116
Something about getting sapped on
the head has a weird effect on me.

01:11:45.201 --> 01:11:47.535
- What's sapped?
- You know.

01:11:47.620 --> 01:11:49.204
Mm-mm.

01:11:49.288 --> 01:11:51.372
Liar.

01:11:53.876 --> 01:11:56.753
- I'd never lie to cowboys.
- You wouldn't, huh?

01:11:59.048 --> 01:12:01.758
Do me a favour.

01:12:01.842 --> 01:12:05.178
Tell me where Ringerman is.
I just wanna talk to him.

01:12:05.971 --> 01:12:08.556
- You want Jimmy?
- Mm-hm.

01:12:08.641 --> 01:12:10.725
I know where he is.

01:12:12.728 --> 01:12:14.812
Later.

01:13:19.378 --> 01:13:22.422
Come on, shoot.
You gonna take all night?

01:13:25.759 --> 01:13:28.094
Ha-ha! Great shot!

01:13:51.452 --> 01:13:53.953
He's looking for Jimmy Ringerman.

01:14:08.635 --> 01:14:12.805
Pushie. He hasn't got a gun.

01:14:24.234 --> 01:14:26.277
Looking for Jimbo, eh?

01:14:29.448 --> 01:14:30.573
Yeah.

01:14:44.421 --> 01:14:46.506
You lost?

01:14:50.302 --> 01:14:52.720
Shouldn't leave your horse, cowboy.

01:15:57.411 --> 01:15:59.495
Cool it, cool it.

01:16:00.539 --> 01:16:03.416
Come on, come on.
Let's get out of here.

01:16:47.252 --> 01:16:51.797
Where's Ringerman?

01:18:33.108 --> 01:18:35.192
You bastard.

01:18:35.986 --> 01:18:39.113
Have you any idea
of the damage you've done?

01:18:39.197 --> 01:18:41.324
I'm talking about Linny Raven.

01:18:41.742 --> 01:18:45.828
I just got her out of jail.
She was picked up near that pool room.

01:18:45.912 --> 01:18:48.914
Do you know what that means?
Violation of parole.

01:18:48.999 --> 01:18:52.752
So thanks to you, Mr Coogan,
she will finish her sentence.

01:18:53.587 --> 01:18:56.589
And... on the way
back to her place,

01:18:56.673 --> 01:18:58.758
she and I had a long talk.

01:18:59.801 --> 01:19:02.345
She's a painfully
graphic little girl.

01:19:03.430 --> 01:19:06.390
She gave me a play-by-play
description of...

01:19:07.225 --> 01:19:10.811
how you slept with her, boots and...

01:19:10.896 --> 01:19:15.816
You came here at four o'clock in the
morning just to tell me all this?

01:19:16.902 --> 01:19:18.986
I...

01:19:20.113 --> 01:19:22.907
I thought I saw
something in you. I...

01:19:22.991 --> 01:19:25.660
Shut up down there!

01:19:33.710 --> 01:19:38.506
All this talk about Linny Raven.
Is that really why you're so mad?

01:20:20.799 --> 01:20:23.300
- You're takin' me to Ringerman.
- No!

01:22:30.846 --> 01:22:33.013
Keep goin'.

01:22:34.307 --> 01:22:37.017
I'll be right behind you.

01:23:48.590 --> 01:23:52.468
Jimmy! Jimmy!

01:23:54.804 --> 01:23:57.473
Jimmy!

01:23:58.725 --> 01:24:02.144
Jimmy! Jimmy!

01:24:02.854 --> 01:24:06.190
- What the hell are you doin' here?
- I brought him here. I had to.

01:24:06.274 --> 01:24:08.984
You shoulda seen him!
He was gonna bust my face open!

01:24:09.069 --> 01:24:11.070
- Who'd you bring here?
- The cowboy.

01:24:11.154 --> 01:24:13.697
He was right behind me
and now he's gone.

01:24:19.329 --> 01:24:22.122
What'd you bring him here for?
You stupid freak!

01:24:22.207 --> 01:24:23.815
Ringerman!

01:24:31.041 --> 01:24:32.742
Ringerman!

01:24:36.846 --> 01:24:38.847
Hey! Ringerman!

01:24:59.369 --> 01:25:01.620
Jimmy! Jimmy!

01:25:04.040 --> 01:25:05.405
Jimmy!

01:25:06.031 --> 01:25:07.446
Jimmy!

01:25:08.620 --> 01:25:11.170
Jimmy!

01:25:25.895 --> 01:25:29.523
Come on, you son of a bitch.
Come on!

01:25:30.859 --> 01:25:33.235
You damn fool!

01:25:42.620 --> 01:25:44.705
Hey!

01:25:45.582 --> 01:25:48.042
Where the hell are you goin'
with my bike?

01:25:48.126 --> 01:25:49.501
Hey!

01:25:49.586 --> 01:25:53.088
Hey, come back with my bike!
Where are you goin'?

01:30:01.713 --> 01:30:03.839
I'm makin' a citizen's arrest.

01:30:06.217 --> 01:30:08.302
Take him back to Bellevue.

01:30:17.478 --> 01:30:19.938
I'm gettin' too old for
these police cars.

01:30:20.523 --> 01:30:22.607
When do "I" get him?

01:30:24.694 --> 01:30:29.448
First you go to the DA's office,
then the state supreme court.

01:30:29.532 --> 01:30:34.119
Then you don't lay a glove on him until
he's officially released by Bellevue.

01:30:34.203 --> 01:30:36.371
Now, is that all right with you?

01:30:43.588 --> 01:30:48.008
Yeah. That's all right
with me, Lieutenant.

01:31:10.740 --> 01:31:12.824
Much obliged.

01:31:14.786 --> 01:31:16.870
Come on.

01:31:22.377 --> 01:31:24.461
Lieutenant.

01:31:25.671 --> 01:31:28.590
- Sheriff.
- Thanks.

01:31:31.260 --> 01:31:33.345
My regards to Tex... uh...

01:31:34.555 --> 01:31:36.640
Arizona.
