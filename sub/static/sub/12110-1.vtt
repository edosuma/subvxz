00:36.667 --> 00:38.142
Hey, this is Jeff.

00:38.166 --> 00:41.351
And Elise!
Yep, we did it!

00:41.375 --> 00:44.684
I'm finally moving in! Because
we're getting married in a few weeks!

00:44.708 --> 00:47.351
Okay, just leave me --
us -- a message.

00:47.375 --> 00:48.810
Bye!

00:48.834 --> 00:51.851
Hey, it's Mike, your friendly
neighborhood travel agent.

00:51.875 --> 00:55.684
Yep, summer's here, so just a few
last-minute details to go over

00:55.708 --> 00:57.851
for your Paris honeymoon,
and then we're all...

00:57.875 --> 01:00.726
Leçon 3:
Freezer... Le congélateur

01:00.750 --> 01:03.710
Congélateur.

01:06.250 --> 01:08.851
Toilettes.

01:08.875 --> 01:11.351
Plus de vin s'il vous plaît

01:11.375 --> 01:13.059
Combien coûte ce chemisier?

01:13.083 --> 01:16.833
S'il vous -- wow.
Armoire!

01:18.375 --> 01:21.785
Plaqué!
Plaque!

01:22.875 --> 01:25.705
Évier!

01:28.417 --> 01:33.037
Excusez...
baguette.

01:35.542 --> 01:38.393
Ooh, plus de vin s'il vous plait!

01:44.000 --> 01:48.000
* Camp Takota *

01:54.667 --> 01:57.417
Wake up.

02:00.583 --> 02:03.601
Wake up; I'm pregnant!

02:03.625 --> 02:04.810
What?

02:04.834 --> 02:08.267
How do you still fall for that?

02:08.291 --> 02:10.810
Babe, I made you
a breakfast burrito.

02:10.834 --> 02:13.893
Oh, mmm. What time is it?

02:13.917 --> 02:16.059
Seven-thirty.
Why are you up so early?

02:16.083 --> 02:19.935
Is it still considered being up early
if you never went to sleep?

02:19.959 --> 02:21.434
How are you functioning?

02:21.458 --> 02:22.393
I don't know.

02:22.417 --> 02:23.810
Bodies are weird, right?

02:23.834 --> 02:25.810
Science, etcetera.

02:25.834 --> 02:26.935
Caffeine?

02:26.959 --> 02:28.393
So much of it.

02:28.417 --> 02:30.726
But the good news:
I finally finished.

02:30.750 --> 02:32.768
Oh, no way!

02:32.792 --> 02:36.726
Yeah! At 6:37 a.m.,
I finally typed the words "The End."

02:36.750 --> 02:37.768
That's incredible.

02:37.792 --> 02:38.893
Yeah.

02:38.917 --> 02:40.601
So, how do we celebrate?

02:40.625 --> 02:42.768
Sex... with you!

02:42.792 --> 02:44.601
Get up!

02:44.625 --> 02:48.601
Right now? Come on, I have to
get ready for work. So do you.

02:48.625 --> 02:50.893
You are such a tease.

02:52.875 --> 02:56.893
So now that you're finished,
when do I actually get to read it?

02:56.917 --> 02:58.810
Soon... ish.

02:58.834 --> 03:03.309
Babe, come on. This is what I do.
Why are you so afraid to let me read it?

03:03.333 --> 03:07.309
Well, I don't want you to think I'm
using you for your grammatical prowess.

03:07.333 --> 03:10.101
Clearly I'm using
you for your HBO.

03:11.834 --> 03:15.017
That's probably Celia, making sure
I got her a soy latte,

03:15.041 --> 03:17.726
like I haven't been getting
her soy latte for three years.

03:17.750 --> 03:19.684
You going to get her skim?
Obviously.

03:19.708 --> 03:22.538
Yeah.

03:22.834 --> 03:24.267
Hey, careful!

03:24.291 --> 03:29.351
Come on. This is Brooks Brothers.
It's expensive.

03:29.375 --> 03:32.893
Will you go by my place today
and grab the rest of my things?

03:32.917 --> 03:35.726
I can't. I have a meeting
at 10:00 with Vanessa,

03:35.750 --> 03:39.017
and then I've got to get my pages
to the editor by 6:00.

03:39.041 --> 03:41.518
"Ass like Rihanna"
Vanessa?

03:41.875 --> 03:43.351
It's a joke.

03:43.375 --> 03:45.768
I'll pick them up on the way home.
I love you!

03:45.792 --> 03:48.976
I love you.

04:00.708 --> 04:02.476
Here you go:
three lattes.

04:02.500 --> 04:04.210
Thanks.

04:05.375 --> 04:08.184
Elise?
Elise Miller!

04:08.208 --> 04:11.643
Oh, look at you:
all grown up!

04:11.667 --> 04:12.935
Sally Meister?

04:12.959 --> 04:14.893
Says so
on my driver's license.

04:14.917 --> 04:17.726
What are you doing here?
Shouldn't you be at camp?

04:17.750 --> 04:19.899
Oh, just doing some
last-minute recruiting.

04:19.925 --> 04:22.601
I'm still two counselors and
a lifeguard shy of a full staff.

04:22.625 --> 04:24.059
You want to come aboard?

04:24.083 --> 04:28.275
That is very tempting, but I think
my summers of armpit bug bites are over.

04:28.300 --> 04:29.950
Actually I work
in publishing now.

04:29.975 --> 04:31.601
Oh, do you?

04:31.625 --> 04:34.726
Yeah, Lou Bell Press.They do a lot
of young adult fantasy stuff.

04:34.750 --> 04:37.017
Have you heard of the
Midnight Moonlight series?

04:37.041 --> 04:39.351
Maybe.
What have we got here?

04:39.375 --> 04:41.226
I'm getting married
in two weeks.

04:41.250 --> 04:44.059
Oh, congratulations.
Where are you honeymooning?

04:44.083 --> 04:47.017
Paris.
Ooh la la!

04:47.041 --> 04:49.559
Before you know it, you'll be driving
your little ones up

04:49.583 --> 04:51.101
to Takota for the summer yourself.

04:51.125 --> 04:53.601
Oh, man.
I think my ovaries just winced.

04:53.625 --> 04:56.226
I'm not really the offspring type,

04:56.250 --> 04:58.935
but if I was,
they'd be Takota girls.

04:58.959 --> 05:01.393
I'm sorry, Sally.
I've really got to go.

05:01.417 --> 05:04.935
Oh, I've got to get a move on
myself; I'm meeting Jared for breakfast.

05:04.959 --> 05:06.559
You remember my
son, don't you?

05:06.583 --> 05:10.393
He taped a walkie-talkie to his head
and called it a Bluetooth.Who could forget?

05:10.417 --> 05:12.101
He always loved his technology.

05:12.125 --> 05:16.059
He actually made a fortune
on one of those app thingies.

05:16.083 --> 05:17.810
Oh, that's cool.

05:17.834 --> 05:19.768
Yeah, it's called
Hot Crotch.

05:19.792 --> 05:23.559
It can take your temperature if you point
your phone at your, well, crotch.

05:23.583 --> 05:24.935
Unique.

05:24.959 --> 05:26.976
It's ridiculous!

05:27.000 --> 05:30.434
Oh, I know you've got to go,
but you should consider coming up

05:30.458 --> 05:32.267
for visitors' weekend.
Lots of familiar faces.

05:32.291 --> 05:33.893
I'll think about it.
Bye, Sally.

05:33.917 --> 05:35.101
Oh!
Oh!

05:35.125 --> 05:36.705
Careful!

05:48.500 --> 05:52.101
Good morning.
Lou Bell Press, Gil speaking.

05:56.208 --> 05:57.810
Morning, Celia.

05:57.834 --> 06:01.142
You listen to me. I have a vacancy
on my fall publishing schedule.

06:01.166 --> 06:04.142
Well, she needs to be prepared
to return her advance

06:04.166 --> 06:07.768
in full, which- based on the new nose
she's been sporting --

06:07.792 --> 06:09.643
appears to already be spent.

06:09.667 --> 06:10.976
Has His Highness arrived yet?

06:11.000 --> 06:13.300
His agent called from the car and said
that they are on their way.

06:13.325 --> 06:14.810
Is everything ready?
Yes.

06:14.834 --> 06:15.643
Food?
Delivered.

06:15.667 --> 06:17.059
Contest winners?
Conference room.

06:17.083 --> 06:19.017
Releases?
Signed.

06:19.041 --> 06:21.001
And... sent to Legal.

06:21.417 --> 06:24.017
You'll be taking pictures
at the meet-and-greet.

06:24.041 --> 06:28.267
In addition to live tweeting the event and
moderating the Reddit Q&A?

06:28.291 --> 06:30.291
No problem.

06:30.792 --> 06:34.810
Elise, please return your sarcasm
along with that parody of a jacket.

06:34.834 --> 06:37.000
I have enough to deal with.

06:38.025 --> 06:40.076
Jillian Raab is too busy
sniffing her book advance

06:40.100 --> 06:42.017
up her new nose to
actually write any pages.

06:42.041 --> 06:45.518
Well, actually, Celia, this might be
totally inappropriate,

06:45.542 --> 06:48.518
but I actually finished
my book last night.

06:48.542 --> 06:51.935
And I only bring this up
because it's also YA fantasy,

06:51.959 --> 06:56.709
it deals with unrequited
love and Loch Ness monsters.

06:57.667 --> 06:59.887
It's called "Un-Loch My
Heart,"tentatively, and

06:59.911 --> 07:02.059
I actually have it here
on a thumb drive if --

07:02.083 --> 07:05.083
That was
totally inappropriate.

07:05.834 --> 07:09.384
And lucky for you,
I am totally desperate.

07:11.417 --> 07:14.226
By all means, take your time
digging through old receipts

07:14.250 --> 07:16.830
and Doritos wrappers.
I have all day.

07:19.750 --> 07:20.601
Okay.

07:20.625 --> 07:24.351
Yeah.
Thank you, Celia.

07:24.375 --> 07:28.684
Well, I'll see if I have time to read
it based on how smoothly today goes.

07:28.708 --> 07:31.285
I don't need to remind you
how important Walker Paige's

07:31.309 --> 07:33.768
support and the support of
his fans is to Lou Bell.

07:33.792 --> 07:36.922
Absolutely.
Everything will be perfect.

07:46.291 --> 07:48.393
Oh, my God!
It's Walker Paige!

07:48.417 --> 07:50.851
He's real!
He's real!

07:50.875 --> 07:54.935
Look at his hair!
His hand is in it!

08:16.834 --> 08:18.267
What just happened?

08:18.291 --> 08:21.810
It's like they're being murdered
by their own happiness.

08:21.834 --> 08:23.935
I saw a 13-year-old
throw her panties.

08:23.959 --> 08:25.101
Oh, gross.

08:25.125 --> 08:27.915
Oh, vomit.

08:32.500 --> 08:36.210
Who is eating
Walker Paige's face?

08:39.166 --> 08:40.351
Oh, my God!

08:40.375 --> 08:43.643
Isn't he supposed to be
dating his co-star,

08:43.667 --> 08:46.309
the one that went to rehab
for the self-tanning addiction?

08:46.333 --> 08:47.810
How do you know that?

08:47.834 --> 08:49.309
How do you
not know that?

08:49.333 --> 08:52.101
Manda!

08:52.125 --> 08:54.415
Manda!

09:00.583 --> 09:02.142
Elise!
Yes?

09:02.166 --> 09:04.810
What is the point of having
a social media manager

09:04.834 --> 09:07.226
who doesn't manage
any social media?

09:07.250 --> 09:09.893
Oh, it's uploading right now.
Should be any second.

09:09.917 --> 09:12.457
Done.

09:30.375 --> 09:32.393
No...

09:32.417 --> 09:34.184
no, no, no, no...

09:34.208 --> 09:36.309
no, no, no...!

09:36.333 --> 09:38.434
What the fu--?!

09:49.583 --> 09:52.293
Elise, what are you doing home?

09:52.917 --> 09:56.017
Oh, I just got fired.

09:56.041 --> 09:57.434
What do you mean?

09:57.458 --> 10:00.000
It's pretty self-explanatory.

10:00.025 --> 10:01.226
What happened?

10:01.250 --> 10:04.393
I don't know. The technology,
it turned on me

10:04.417 --> 10:06.877
and I couldn't control it
and...

10:07.041 --> 10:09.211
I'm not following.

10:09.417 --> 10:11.377
Hey, hey...

10:12.542 --> 10:15.559
hey, hey, look at me.

10:15.583 --> 10:17.393
You're going to be okay.

10:17.417 --> 10:18.976
Yeah?

10:19.000 --> 10:20.059
Yes.

10:20.083 --> 10:22.423
Okay?

10:22.542 --> 10:24.893
Hey, why don't we...

10:24.917 --> 10:27.434
why don't we go down
to Henry Oh's,

10:27.458 --> 10:30.267
drink way more than we should
for 11:00 a.m. on a Thursday,

10:30.291 --> 10:32.393
and you can tell me
everything that happened?

10:32.417 --> 10:34.226
Can we get nachos?

10:34.250 --> 10:35.935
Absolutely.

10:35.959 --> 10:38.267
Very cool.

10:38.291 --> 10:41.393
Why don't you head down there
and then just get us a booth?

10:41.417 --> 10:44.787
I'll get dressed, and I'll just
meet you over there.

10:46.208 --> 10:48.101
Why did you have two glasses?

10:48.125 --> 10:49.875
I'm sorry, what?

10:50.250 --> 10:54.000
When I walked in, you had two glasses.
Why?

10:54.125 --> 10:56.226
Is there somebody here?

10:56.250 --> 10:58.309
Babe, have you read
this nonsense?

10:58.333 --> 11:01.267
Another teen werewolf novel?

11:01.291 --> 11:05.881
I have seen less cliché writing
in my 12-year-old niece's fan fic-

11:06.500 --> 11:09.434
Elise, I can explain this.
Don't.

11:09.458 --> 11:11.434
And it's not about werewolves.

11:11.458 --> 11:14.128
It's about Loch Ness monsters.

11:17.166 --> 11:18.600
Elise, wait.

11:18.625 --> 11:20.075
You wait!

11:21.000 --> 11:25.580
I am grossed out
and sad about this.

11:34.083 --> 11:36.543
Suck me.

11:52.542 --> 11:55.518
Gah, you are so terrible.

11:55.542 --> 11:59.101
And so, so beautiful.

12:05.875 --> 12:07.810
"Great bumping into you today.

12:07.834 --> 12:09.643
Good luck with the lucky man.

12:09.667 --> 12:12.393
Found this when I got home."

12:26.500 --> 12:29.309
Hi, you've reached Sally.
Leave me a message.

12:29.375 --> 12:31.393
Sally!

12:31.417 --> 12:33.351
It's Elise Miller.

12:33.375 --> 12:35.559
Hey, girl, hey!

12:43.250 --> 12:44.434
Sally!

12:44.458 --> 12:47.059
It's Elise Miller!

12:47.083 --> 12:49.559
It was so good
to see you this morning.

12:49.583 --> 12:52.601
Gah, your face was
on point this morning.

12:52.625 --> 12:55.101
What face cream are you using?

12:55.125 --> 12:57.226
Awesome.
Cool.

12:57.500 --> 13:01.059
Hi, you've reached Sally.
Leave me a message.

13:01.208 --> 13:04.351
Sally, I was thinking
about your offer

13:04.375 --> 13:06.184
to come up to camp.

13:06.208 --> 13:10.059
At first, I was like,
"Elise, say what?

13:10.083 --> 13:11.500
That shit cray!"

13:11.525 --> 13:14.726
And then I was thinking
about it more...

13:21.625 --> 13:24.810
I still know all the camp songs,
like this one,

13:24.834 --> 13:28.434
classic hit
you might remember from 1993.

13:28.458 --> 13:30.267
Let's camp it up.

13:30.291 --> 13:32.059
Camp, camp, camp it up.

13:32.083 --> 13:33.976
Hey, ladies!

13:34.000 --> 13:36.059
"Suck me"?

13:36.083 --> 13:37.601
What?

13:37.625 --> 13:40.101
Who says that?

13:40.125 --> 13:43.226
I would love
to come to camp, okay?

13:43.250 --> 13:46.267
Stop asking me;
I'm going to do it.

13:46.291 --> 13:49.961
Sally, I'm coming to camp.

13:51.291 --> 13:53.601
Oop!
Hey, friend.

14:03.166 --> 14:05.476
Bruce!
Bruce!

14:05.500 --> 14:07.142
412.

14:07.166 --> 14:08.476
Oh, no.

14:08.500 --> 14:10.476
Bruce!

14:16.291 --> 14:19.081
Sally said 412.

14:20.500 --> 14:22.540
Bruce!

14:23.708 --> 14:25.726
Elise!
I got your message.

14:25.750 --> 14:27.976
Or should I say "messages"?

14:28.000 --> 14:30.810
And I can't tell you
how happy I am to hear

14:30.834 --> 14:32.851
you'll be joining us
this summer.

14:32.875 --> 14:35.768
Now, luckily, the Fefferman family
will be passing through

14:35.792 --> 14:39.643
your neck of the woods on their way
to drop off their daughter Penny,

14:39.667 --> 14:41.976
and they have graciously offered
to give you a lift.

14:42.000 --> 14:44.393
So grab your swimsuit
and slap on some sunscreen,

14:44.417 --> 14:46.559
because you're going to camp!

14:46.583 --> 14:49.684
Elise, look:
it's not what it looked like.

14:50.834 --> 14:53.476
Okay, it is --

14:55.917 --> 14:58.518
Oh, my God, Elise,
you must be devastated.

14:58.542 --> 15:01.017
Understatement of the century.

15:01.041 --> 15:05.142
I mean, the GIFs
on Tumblr alone are insane!

15:05.166 --> 15:06.684
Want to get brunch --
I can't.

15:06.708 --> 15:08.643
I...

15:08.667 --> 15:10.518
I'm going to camp.

15:10.542 --> 15:12.476
Oh!
 I haven't tried that place.

15:12.500 --> 15:13.518
What street is it on?

15:13.542 --> 15:16.851
No, actual camp.

15:16.875 --> 15:18.601
Manda, I've got to go.

15:18.625 --> 15:21.101
What?

15:25.417 --> 15:26.935
Hello?

15:26.959 --> 15:29.434
Elise?
It's Kathy Fefferman.

15:29.458 --> 15:31.726
We're here to give
you a ride to camp.

15:31.750 --> 15:33.810
I overslept.

15:33.834 --> 15:36.226
Can you give me
five minutes?

15:36.250 --> 15:38.393
No problem!

15:38.417 --> 15:40.497
Okay,
I'll be right down.

15:47.750 --> 15:49.559
Ooh, bad.

15:49.583 --> 15:51.393
Ooh, bad.

16:10.583 --> 16:11.768
Hi there.

16:11.792 --> 16:14.226
Holy Real Housewife.

16:14.250 --> 16:15.768
You need a hand?

16:15.792 --> 16:17.267
No,
I think I'll be fine.

16:17.291 --> 16:18.434
Yeah.
Honey!

16:18.458 --> 16:19.601
Bruce?

16:19.625 --> 16:20.810
Bruce!

16:20.834 --> 16:23.393
Honey, can you help her?

16:23.417 --> 16:25.787
I am Kathy Fefferman.

16:26.083 --> 16:28.434
It is so wonderful
to meet you.

16:28.458 --> 16:29.768
This is my husband Bruce.

16:29.792 --> 16:31.752
Hi.

16:33.792 --> 16:37.267
Right. And back here, this little nugget,
this is our Penny.

16:37.291 --> 16:38.601
Hi.

16:38.625 --> 16:41.851
If we're going to stay on schedule,
we'd better hit the road ASAP.

16:41.875 --> 16:44.535
Come on, missy.

16:46.333 --> 16:48.253
Everybody buckled up?

16:48.500 --> 16:49.768
Elise, do you like jazz?

16:49.792 --> 16:51.476
Oh, not at all.

16:51.500 --> 16:56.142
We have been listening to a lot of French
jazz lately to get us into the Parisian mood.

16:56.166 --> 16:58.434
We're going
while Penny's at camp.

16:58.458 --> 17:00.810
Have you ever been
to France, Elise?

17:00.834 --> 17:02.810
Ow.

17:02.834 --> 17:05.643
Sorry. Just making sure that this is all
really happening right now.

17:05.666 --> 17:07.518
We went on our honeymoon.
Ah!

17:07.541 --> 17:10.476
And I've been dying,
just dying to go back.

17:10.500 --> 17:14.810
It's so romantic and has these little cafés,
and the Champs-Élysées and the wine.

17:14.834 --> 17:16.184
Bruce!

17:16.208 --> 17:17.518
Signal!

17:17.541 --> 17:19.309
Did I mention
how romantic it is?

17:19.333 --> 17:22.463
You really should try
to go sometime, Elise.

17:24.875 --> 17:26.518
Paris...

17:26.541 --> 17:28.851
Oh, and the Champs-Élysées
and the wine.

17:28.875 --> 17:30.726
Just been dying to get back.

17:30.750 --> 17:31.893
It's so romantic.

17:31.917 --> 17:34.851
It has all these cute little cafés,
and the street lamps,

17:34.875 --> 17:36.684
oh, the Champs-Élysées.

17:36.708 --> 17:39.017
And, oh, the butter and the cheese
and the baguettes

17:39.041 --> 17:41.643
and oh, there's the wine.
Oh, my God, Elise.

17:41.667 --> 17:44.226
It's fabulous. If you ever get a chance,
I'm telling you...

17:44.250 --> 17:45.960
Paris!

17:48.667 --> 17:49.476
Ah!

17:49.500 --> 17:52.351
Oh, Bruce, come on.

17:52.375 --> 17:54.375
Well?

17:55.041 --> 17:56.393
No, don't touch that.

17:56.417 --> 17:58.851
First the lanterns,
then the case of...

17:58.875 --> 18:00.955
It happens.

18:03.667 --> 18:05.518
Are we late?

18:05.542 --> 18:06.643
Not at all.

18:06.667 --> 18:10.559
I just remember drop-off day
being a little more intense.

18:10.583 --> 18:12.184
Oh, it will be... tomorrow.

18:12.208 --> 18:14.434
Penny's a little younger
than the other campers.

18:14.458 --> 18:18.559
I mean, not that she can't handle it.
She is an incredibly mature six-year-old.

18:18.583 --> 18:19.935
Six?

18:19.959 --> 18:24.184
We just thought she might acclimate better
if she had a day here without all that chaos.

18:24.208 --> 18:27.851
Plus between you and me, I have
no desireto be here on drop-off day

18:27.875 --> 18:29.184
with all those neurotic moms.

18:29.208 --> 18:31.393
Bruce! Could you be a little louder?

18:31.417 --> 18:32.935
I still have my hearing.

18:32.959 --> 18:34.142
Got it.

18:34.166 --> 18:37.434
Anyway, I checked with Maxine,
and it's totally fine.

18:37.458 --> 18:40.726
Maxine?
As in Maxine Reynolds?

18:40.750 --> 18:43.851
Kathy, if she's telling you stories about
me, only half of them are true.

18:43.875 --> 18:45.935
Hello!

18:45.959 --> 18:47.810
Max!
Hi!

18:47.834 --> 18:49.600
Oh, when Sally told me
you were coming,

18:49.625 --> 18:50.810
I slapped her.

18:50.834 --> 18:52.434
I straight up slapped
an elderly woman,

18:52.458 --> 18:53.976
because I cannot believe
you're here!

18:54.000 --> 18:56.893
Wow, Elise! You've not changed
a bit in eight years.

18:56.917 --> 19:00.768
And you literally have not
changed a bit in eight years.

19:00.792 --> 19:01.434
Well...

19:01.458 --> 19:02.976
Not true.

19:03.000 --> 19:04.601
She's finally lost her virginity.

19:04.625 --> 19:05.768
Barely.

19:05.792 --> 19:06.976
Allison. Hey.

19:07.000 --> 19:09.393
I saw you on my way to the mess.

19:09.417 --> 19:10.768
The mess? Uh-huh.

19:10.792 --> 19:12.226
Oh, God.

19:12.250 --> 19:15.476
Please don't tell me your mom is
still up there making grilled cheese.

19:15.500 --> 19:16.768
No, no.

19:16.792 --> 19:17.700
Thank God.

19:17.725 --> 19:19.710
She's no longer with us.

19:20.625 --> 19:21.893
Allison, I'm so sorry.

19:21.917 --> 19:24.976
She's no longer with us because
she retired to Boca Raton.

19:25.000 --> 19:27.601
Elise, don't believe anything
that comes out of her mouth.

19:27.625 --> 19:29.976
I took over for her
like six years ago.

19:30.000 --> 19:32.810
I don't mean to interrupt,
but I couldn't help but overhear.

19:32.834 --> 19:34.851
Are you the Allison
I've been emailing with?

19:34.875 --> 19:36.476
That depends.
Who might you be?

19:36.500 --> 19:37.518
Where are my manners?

19:37.542 --> 19:38.700
Kathy Fefferman.

19:38.725 --> 19:40.684
Oh.
Mrs. Fefferman.

19:40.708 --> 19:44.434
It is so nice to put a face
to dozens and dozens of detailed emails.

19:44.458 --> 19:46.810
Do you have a minute?

19:46.834 --> 19:49.544
I'd like to go over Penny's
dietary restrictions.

19:50.166 --> 19:52.286
I would love nothing more.

19:53.208 --> 19:56.768
Welcome back, business casual.

19:56.792 --> 19:59.101
Yeah, what is this
look you got going on?

19:59.125 --> 20:01.935
Max, do you have a
place I can charge this?

20:01.959 --> 20:04.476
Oh, there's no need.
This is a 100 percent cell-free zone.

20:04.500 --> 20:05.684
Say what now?

20:05.708 --> 20:08.434
Yeah, there's zero service up here.
I made sure of it.

20:08.458 --> 20:10.351
So let's go to your cabin!

20:10.375 --> 20:12.684
Grab your bags!
Grab your trash bags!

20:12.708 --> 20:14.726
Only one of them is a trash bag.

20:14.750 --> 20:17.059
Luggage by Hefty.

20:17.083 --> 20:19.017
Were these Christmas gifts?

20:19.041 --> 20:20.851
How does it feel to be back?

20:20.875 --> 20:22.142
Very surreal.

20:22.166 --> 20:25.768
I had no idea that you
and Allison would be here.

20:25.792 --> 20:28.976
What, have you just like
not left since we were 19?

20:29.000 --> 20:31.518
I wish. But during the school year,
I teach fourth grade

20:31.542 --> 20:32.559
in the South Loop.

20:32.583 --> 20:33.851
Hey, you live in Chicago?
Uh-huh.

20:33.875 --> 20:37.017
I live in Chicago. I'm surprised
I haven't run into you.

20:37.041 --> 20:40.476
Weird. But I really only hang
out at like one bar, so.

20:40.500 --> 20:41.559
Oh, which one?

20:41.583 --> 20:43.684
It's called my couch.

20:43.708 --> 20:45.476
Yeah, they have really good
box wine specials.

20:45.500 --> 20:46.726
Yeah, I love that place.

20:46.750 --> 20:48.184
It's really exclusive.

20:48.208 --> 20:51.393
Anyways, when I take over as camp
director, I'll move up here full-time.

20:51.417 --> 20:52.518
Wait, is Sally retiring?

20:52.542 --> 20:53.893
She says it's her last year.

20:53.917 --> 20:58.184
I mean, nothing's actually been
officially announced, but look at me.

20:58.208 --> 21:00.059
Yeah, you're a shoe-in.

21:00.083 --> 21:03.184
Hope so, or there's going to
be a shoe in someone's ass.

21:03.208 --> 21:05.726
Cabin number six: your home
sweet home for the summer.

21:05.750 --> 21:07.142
Wow.

21:07.166 --> 21:08.726
Just like you remembered it?

21:08.750 --> 21:11.059
A little smaller.

21:12.875 --> 21:15.684
So, what are you doing here?

21:15.708 --> 21:18.351
Not that I'm not completely
thrilled to see you,

21:18.375 --> 21:22.935
because I am, but Sally said you're in
publishing or you're a writer or something.

21:22.959 --> 21:24.101
Yeah, I am.

21:24.125 --> 21:26.101
I...

21:26.125 --> 21:28.017
I got a book deal.

21:28.041 --> 21:29.400
Seriously?

21:29.425 --> 21:30.893
Yeah.

21:30.917 --> 21:33.184
That is awesome, Elise!
Congratulations!

21:33.208 --> 21:36.184
Thanks.
Wow.

21:36.208 --> 21:39.434
Yeah, I thought I would
get out of Chicago,

21:39.458 --> 21:42.958
get some peace and quiet
for writing.

21:44.291 --> 21:48.351
Not that that will in any way keep
me from providing care for your campers.

21:48.375 --> 21:51.142
Yeah. I don't care what you do
in your free periods.

21:51.166 --> 21:52.810
Just don't slack on the clock.

21:52.834 --> 21:54.101
Oh, Takota honor.

21:54.125 --> 21:55.601
What is that?

21:55.625 --> 21:57.226
That?

21:57.250 --> 22:01.101
That's going to be an no, that's
heavy metal rock or something like that.

22:01.125 --> 22:03.434
Oh, I remember now.
This, right?

22:03.458 --> 22:05.059
Okay, that is not honorable.

22:05.083 --> 22:06.726
How dare you.

22:06.750 --> 22:10.559
Okay, get it out of your system
before the kids get here!

22:51.166 --> 22:54.768
...two, three fish.

22:54.792 --> 22:56.810
What's that?
Oh, it's a fish!

22:56.834 --> 22:58.893
We see a fish!

22:58.917 --> 23:01.476
We see tons of them.

23:01.500 --> 23:03.184
Come on!

23:03.208 --> 23:04.684
I'll beat you there.

23:04.708 --> 23:06.851
Elise, wait up!

24:09.917 --> 24:11.601
Good morning, campers.

24:11.625 --> 24:13.559
Good morning, Sally.

24:13.583 --> 24:19.003
On behalf of the entire
Takota staff, welcome to camp!

24:23.458 --> 24:25.601
I can't tell you how excited we are

24:25.625 --> 24:29.976
to be spending our 57th summer
on the lake with you.

24:30.000 --> 24:33.518
Takota girls know how
special this place is,

24:33.542 --> 24:36.059
that when you drive down
that camp road,

24:36.083 --> 24:38.935
you know you're about
to spend the summer growing

24:38.959 --> 24:41.559
and learning and, best of all,

24:41.583 --> 24:44.476
making lifelong friendships.

24:44.500 --> 24:48.601
It's so important to treasure
these months away from school,

24:48.625 --> 24:54.726
and boys, so please, girls, keep
the crushes on our handyman Chet

24:54.750 --> 24:57.101
to a minimum this year.

24:57.125 --> 25:01.393
Well, I can't wait to get started,
and I know you can't either,

25:01.417 --> 25:04.434
so let's sign up for some activities!

25:04.458 --> 25:08.998
As soon as we're done talking
about some restrictions!

25:09.166 --> 25:10.810
Alright, girls.

25:10.834 --> 25:13.476
We all know that camp rules.

25:13.500 --> 25:16.830
But let's talk about some camp rules.

25:19.708 --> 25:21.768
Hit it, Allison.

25:21.834 --> 25:24.017
♪ Oh yeah, Takota. ♪

25:24.041 --> 25:26.309
♪ This ain't your boring
camp rules breakdown. ♪

25:26.333 --> 25:27.309
♪ Uh-uh. ♪

25:27.333 --> 25:29.643
♪ This is me,
breaking down camp rules. ♪

25:29.667 --> 25:33.434
♪ Rule number one: make your bunk,
make your bunk. ♪

25:33.458 --> 25:35.476
♪ Oh yeah, Takota. ♪

25:35.500 --> 25:37.830
♪ Rule number two... ♪♪

25:38.834 --> 25:40.309
Thank you very much,
ladies.

25:40.333 --> 25:41.643
Hold the phone.

25:41.667 --> 25:44.684
I only got five bucks,
and everyone else got 10.

25:44.708 --> 25:47.017
Let that be a
lesson to you, Sarah.

25:47.041 --> 25:50.476
There's a time and a placefor improvisation,
and my stage is neither the time,

25:50.500 --> 25:53.000
nor the place, okay?

25:53.500 --> 25:56.684
And Sarah, if you're going
to sneak cigarettes into camp,

25:56.708 --> 25:59.643
have the decency to slap on some
Bath and Body Works

25:59.667 --> 26:01.497
vanilla body spray, okay?

26:04.083 --> 26:05.833
Amateurs!

26:08.291 --> 26:10.351
Let me guess:
cabin Robin's Egg?

26:10.375 --> 26:13.851
Yeah, when they get to Robin's Egg,
they're like totes supes mature.

26:13.875 --> 26:15.518
They talk like that now.

26:15.542 --> 26:19.132
Hey, Robin's Egg is where
I met my two best friends.

26:19.375 --> 26:20.851
Elise!

26:20.875 --> 26:22.684
I'm talking about my boobs.

26:22.708 --> 26:24.351
I grew two cup sizes that summer.

26:24.375 --> 26:26.226
How could I forget?

26:26.250 --> 26:29.726
Well, meet your new best friend.

26:29.750 --> 26:33.500
It's just a little something I whipped
up to get you back in the Takota saddle.

26:33.525 --> 26:34.600
Oh, it's color-coded.

26:34.625 --> 26:35.726
Isn't it great?

26:35.750 --> 26:37.726
There's a detailed arts
and crafts lesson plan,

26:37.750 --> 26:41.726
a chapter on Takota folklore, and
then sheet music for all the camp songs.

26:41.750 --> 26:44.893
Thanks, Max. You know, I think
I'm just going to wing it.

26:44.917 --> 26:45.851
Oh, no.

26:45.875 --> 26:49.226
We don't just wing stuff
here at Takota, Elise.

26:49.250 --> 26:51.184
Max, it's camp.

26:51.208 --> 26:52.476
How hard can it be?

26:52.500 --> 26:55.130
No, you take that.

26:55.917 --> 26:58.226
Study up!

26:58.250 --> 27:00.040
Amateur.

27:04.083 --> 27:07.017
Good morning, campers!

27:17.458 --> 27:19.893
No!

27:32.959 --> 27:35.267
No.

27:37.959 --> 27:39.017
No!

27:39.041 --> 27:40.500
Girls, wait!

27:40.525 --> 27:42.393
I'm the trail leader, girls.

27:42.917 --> 27:44.476
Wait!

27:45.750 --> 27:48.580
We take our shirt, we drop it in.

27:48.792 --> 27:50.976
No! I'm not playing
water balloons!

27:51.000 --> 27:54.851
Then you pull it out and, ah...

27:56.125 --> 27:58.309
Go ahead and try it.

28:24.458 --> 28:26.601
Can I hide in here for a while?

28:26.625 --> 28:28.351
Yeah, how long you need?

28:28.375 --> 28:30.768
Until August?

28:30.792 --> 28:33.184
Alright, well, if you're
here, you've got to work.

28:33.208 --> 28:36.142
And sometimes it's not very...
appealing.

28:36.166 --> 28:36.975
Oh, my God.

28:36.999 --> 28:39.518
Get ready for a lot of that.

28:39.542 --> 28:41.764
Can you just crush up a
bunch of Adderall and

28:41.788 --> 28:43.935
put it in whatever you're
making for dinner?

28:43.959 --> 28:45.351
Because these kids are maniacs.

28:45.375 --> 28:46.559
Oh, come on.

28:46.583 --> 28:47.643
We were way worse.

28:47.667 --> 28:48.851
That is not true.

28:48.875 --> 28:52.935
Elise, we exchanged our
counselor's toothpaste for Vagisil.

28:52.959 --> 28:54.643
That is true.

28:54.667 --> 28:58.017
Anyway, if stuff ever gets too
rough out there, just come in here

28:58.041 --> 29:00.518
and grab yourself
a bowl of FiberNuts.

29:00.542 --> 29:04.643
Okay, I'm all for being regular, but I think
I need something a little stronger than fiber, Al.

29:04.667 --> 29:06.957
Just go grab the box.

29:07.375 --> 29:10.205
Okay, weirdo.

29:17.750 --> 29:20.226
Just stick your hand in.

29:20.250 --> 29:22.684
You must be really good
at dirty talk.

29:22.708 --> 29:25.059
Incidentally, yes.

29:27.041 --> 29:29.081
That's Max's secret stash.

29:29.250 --> 29:33.580
You think a kid's going to come
in here for a healthy snack?

29:36.291 --> 29:38.393
So...

29:38.417 --> 29:40.184
who was the guy in the truck?

29:40.208 --> 29:41.267
Oh, Eli?

29:41.291 --> 29:42.476
Eli's great.

29:42.500 --> 29:45.726
Heads-up: he does spend nine
months of the year as Eloise,

29:45.750 --> 29:49.059
but he does come up here in
the summer to untuck his dingaling

29:49.083 --> 29:51.173
and grow some fresh vegetables.

29:52.417 --> 29:53.976
I can't believe you bought that.

29:54.000 --> 29:55.267
I said the word "dingaling."

29:55.291 --> 29:57.142
Why do you keep messing
with me?

29:57.166 --> 29:58.726
Because I'm bored.

29:58.750 --> 30:00.768
I'm in the kitchen all day,
every day,

30:00.792 --> 30:02.309
making 200 pounds of tater tots.

30:02.333 --> 30:04.768
Which were delicious, by the way.

30:04.792 --> 30:06.935
Thanks. Anyway, Eli's great.

30:06.959 --> 30:11.267
He's got a local farm across the lake, and
he brings us fresh produce when he can.

30:11.291 --> 30:15.142
Because God knows our food budget only
allows for stuff that's frozen or in a box.

30:15.166 --> 30:17.601
So he's a farmer.

30:17.625 --> 30:19.184
Somebody's interested.

30:19.208 --> 30:20.684
Oh, please.

30:20.708 --> 30:25.101
No, thank you. I am using this summer
as a welcome break from penis.

30:25.125 --> 30:27.125
Story of my life.

30:28.959 --> 30:33.267
I knew you and Lindsay Johnson
weren't just practicing Frenching!

30:33.291 --> 30:35.601
Yeah, but I got
really good at it.

30:35.625 --> 30:37.684
Yeah, you got really good
at being a stereotype.

30:37.708 --> 30:39.309
What are you talking about?

30:39.333 --> 30:41.810
This is cool!

30:43.041 --> 30:44.643
Oh, gosh.

30:44.667 --> 30:46.267
I've got to go.

30:46.291 --> 30:47.643
Okay.

30:47.667 --> 30:49.518
Come on, let's go.

30:49.542 --> 30:51.601
Hustle up.

31:02.583 --> 31:05.673
El? El, can you hear me? Over.

31:06.250 --> 31:08.059
Yep, I'm here.

31:08.083 --> 31:10.434
Have you seen the
Penny Fefferman kid?

31:10.458 --> 31:14.393
She's the only kid from our cabin that
isn't at the Lady Gaga ice cream social.

31:14.417 --> 31:15.267
Over.

31:15.291 --> 31:17.500
No, but I can go
check on her cabin.

31:17.525 --> 31:18.559
That would be great.

31:18.583 --> 31:19.893
Thank you!

31:19.917 --> 31:22.142
Then get your ass down here.
Over.

31:22.166 --> 31:24.184
I think I'm going to pass.

31:24.208 --> 31:26.998
You're supposed to say "over."
Over.

31:28.208 --> 31:30.810
Over... it.

31:30.834 --> 31:34.059
That was rude, but clever.
Over.

31:34.083 --> 31:37.643
McKensie!
That is your third cone!

31:39.500 --> 31:41.476
Madison, you are lactose intolerant!

31:41.500 --> 31:44.643
Come on!

31:45.542 --> 31:47.351
Ah-ha!

31:47.375 --> 31:50.518
Caught you red-handed.

31:50.542 --> 31:55.172
I've been waiting four days to make
that joke, and I wasted it on a six-year-old.

31:55.417 --> 31:58.351
Elise, are you going
to tell on me?

31:58.375 --> 32:00.184
Oh, that depends.

32:00.208 --> 32:02.788
Did you bring the other one?

32:08.375 --> 32:10.785
Are you having fun at camp?

32:11.875 --> 32:13.559
Yeah.

32:13.583 --> 32:16.184
My thoughts exactly.

32:20.542 --> 32:22.893
Okay, girls. We all know

32:22.917 --> 32:27.226
that part of being a Takota girl means
making the best out of a bad situation.

32:27.250 --> 32:29.241
So, even though it's going
to storm tonight, and

32:29.265 --> 32:31.351
some jacked-up raccoons
ruined our s'mores station,

32:31.375 --> 32:34.059
that doesn't mean
that we can't have a campout.

32:34.083 --> 32:36.184
And what's the best
part about a campout?

32:36.208 --> 32:37.184
Sleeping.

32:37.208 --> 32:39.226
That's right: ghost stories.

32:39.250 --> 32:42.267
Is this the Takota
campout ghost story?

32:42.291 --> 32:43.518
Might be.

32:43.542 --> 32:44.768
Unless you're too scared.

32:44.792 --> 32:46.768
It's not scary at all.

32:46.792 --> 32:48.267
Oh, really?

32:48.291 --> 32:51.893
A hiker pushes his best friend
off a mountain ledge,

32:51.917 --> 32:56.434
and now that friend's ghost roams
these very woods, seeking revenge.

32:56.458 --> 32:58.538
That's not scary to you?

32:59.125 --> 33:02.810
Okay. Well, what if I told you
that the Takota ghost

33:02.834 --> 33:07.810
is lured to campfires, just like
the campfires we have back at camp?

33:07.834 --> 33:09.518
That's never happened.

33:09.542 --> 33:11.893
Yes, it has.

33:11.917 --> 33:15.768
In fact, there's someone at camp
right now who's seen the ghost

33:15.792 --> 33:17.226
with their own eyes.

33:17.250 --> 33:19.250
Prove it.

33:19.458 --> 33:21.628
Okay.

33:21.792 --> 33:24.684
Do you know that new counselor, Elise?

33:24.708 --> 33:28.434
Well, back when she was a
camper, probably about your age,

33:28.458 --> 33:30.851
the ghost showed up at her campout.

33:30.875 --> 33:34.518
In fact, last night,
she said she saw the ghost

33:34.542 --> 33:38.476
roaming the woods, moaning in pain.

33:38.500 --> 33:41.184
"Elise...

33:41.208 --> 33:45.184
Elise..."

33:46.667 --> 33:48.377
"Elise."

33:49.875 --> 33:51.745
Goodnight, girls.

33:52.625 --> 33:54.705
Sleep tight.

34:13.625 --> 34:15.665
Oh, dear God.

34:16.208 --> 34:17.851
...but like
an actual tater tot.

34:17.875 --> 34:19.643
Max?
Max, are you there?

34:19.667 --> 34:20.851
Hold on.

34:20.875 --> 34:23.016
This is Max.
Over.

34:23.041 --> 34:25.559
Can you come into the cabin?
It's an emergency.

34:25.583 --> 34:26.851
Yeah.
We'll be right there.

34:26.875 --> 34:28.016
What is this
all about?

34:28.041 --> 34:30.726
She probably got a
tater tot in her butt.

34:30.750 --> 34:31.726
Shut up.

34:31.750 --> 34:34.684
I just needed
to get a second opinion.

34:34.708 --> 34:38.559
Well, my opinion is that
it is great to have you back.

34:38.583 --> 34:41.672
Seriously, what is
going on down there?

34:43.542 --> 34:45.184
Okay.

34:45.208 --> 34:49.393
Initial thoughts. You clearly take a lot
of pride in grooming.

34:49.417 --> 34:51.226
I mean, wow, Elise.

34:51.250 --> 34:53.559
Also, watch where
you squat, dum-dum.

34:53.583 --> 34:56.266
You've got poison ivy all up
in your hoo-ha.

34:56.291 --> 34:57.600
And it's bad.

34:57.625 --> 35:00.017
It's really bad!
It's really bad.

35:00.041 --> 35:01.559
Wait,
that's...

35:01.583 --> 35:02.601
that's it?

35:02.625 --> 35:04.226
Yeah.

35:04.250 --> 35:06.017
Are you positive?
I'm positive.

35:06.041 --> 35:08.893
I'm positive, Elise.

35:10.083 --> 35:13.559
My brain just goes to
the worst-case scenario, you know?

35:13.583 --> 35:16.226
I thought it was like the herp
or something.

35:16.250 --> 35:18.768
Did you just call it "the herp"?

35:18.792 --> 35:22.726
Elise, you make an STD
sound like a '60s dance craze.

35:22.750 --> 35:25.059
♪♪ Come on, everybody,
let's do the herp. ♪

35:25.083 --> 35:26.142

35:32.834 --> 35:34.893
Alright.
Okay.

35:34.917 --> 35:37.726
I can go get some oatmeal
and make an oatmeal bath.

35:37.750 --> 35:40.267
You can run to the infirmary,
grab some calamine lotion.

35:40.291 --> 35:43.476
And then Elise, if you could just
start putting all of your underwear

35:43.500 --> 35:45.309
in the freezer, it would be great.

35:45.333 --> 35:48.810
No, but seriously, like how often do you wax?
Because it looks like a Barbie down there.

35:48.834 --> 35:51.893
Yeah, seriously. And the underwear will
help because it's hot like a campfire.

35:51.917 --> 35:53.768
Oh, yeah. It is generating
some heat, girl.

35:53.792 --> 35:54.726
Thank you.

35:54.750 --> 35:56.434
You can be a campfire
with that crotch.

35:56.458 --> 36:01.017
We're done! We're done!
We're done!

36:11.208 --> 36:13.851
Okay, alright.

36:13.875 --> 36:16.684
Alright, girls?

36:17.458 --> 36:19.309
Okay, calm down.

36:19.333 --> 36:21.893
Calm down, you little maniacs!

36:23.000 --> 36:24.976
Girls...

36:25.000 --> 36:27.290
girls, I'm pregnant!

36:28.959 --> 36:31.101
Works on all ages. Very cool.

36:31.125 --> 36:35.309
Today we are going to take the flowers
that we picked yesterday,

36:35.333 --> 36:38.643
and we're going to press them and
turn them into some cool bookmarks.

36:38.667 --> 36:41.747
Did everyone bring a book
like I asked them to?

36:45.417 --> 36:47.142
Wonderful.

36:47.166 --> 36:50.456
Okay, let's start picking our flowers.

36:51.708 --> 36:53.810
Elise, can I get your roll?

36:53.834 --> 36:55.184
Everyone's here.

36:55.208 --> 36:58.038
I still need it
for the office.

37:02.000 --> 37:03.643
This is a Slim Jim wrapper.

37:03.667 --> 37:06.787
Yeah. Roll with it, Cassidy.

37:06.917 --> 37:09.184
Okay.

37:09.208 --> 37:12.059
By the way, the office wanted me
to bring you these phone messages.

37:12.083 --> 37:15.543
Somebody's popular.

37:26.542 --> 37:27.643
Oh, look!

37:27.667 --> 37:30.518
Elise got some love notes!

37:31.041 --> 37:32.768
Girls, stop.

37:32.792 --> 37:33.851
Give those back.

37:33.875 --> 37:35.059
Girls.

37:35.083 --> 37:36.518
Girls.

37:36.542 --> 37:37.559
Give me them.

37:52.542 --> 37:54.752
There was no tree.

37:54.917 --> 37:59.935
Yeah, there was K-I-S-S-I-N-G -ing,
but guess what?

37:59.959 --> 38:02.726
It wasn't with me.

38:02.750 --> 38:04.893
And that's okay,
because you know what, girls?

38:04.917 --> 38:07.518
I'm here to tell you the truth.

38:07.542 --> 38:12.542
And the truth is that love doesn't exist.

38:12.750 --> 38:17.460
It is a concept that's been created by
jewelry stores and all-inclusive cruise ships!

38:18.417 --> 38:21.267
Because when you think
that you've found love,

38:21.291 --> 38:24.434
you find out that you found love's
side-piece named Vanessa,

38:24.458 --> 38:30.810
who has really beautiful hair and
somehow always looks good in boy shorts!

38:30.834 --> 38:32.476
Hey, Elise...

38:32.500 --> 38:35.017
can I speak to you for a second?

38:35.041 --> 38:39.309
And that is why I love daisies.

38:39.333 --> 38:42.253
I'll be right back.

38:46.959 --> 38:48.935
What the hell is
the matter with you?

38:48.959 --> 38:51.476
Nothing.
I'm fine. It's PMS.

38:51.500 --> 38:55.893
Okay, well then, eat a cookie; don't have
a meltdown in front of a bunch of little kids.

38:55.917 --> 38:56.726
Okay, Elise.

38:56.750 --> 38:58.600
Here's what we're
going to do, okay?

38:58.625 --> 39:01.810
I'm going to go finish the Katy
Perry Kayak Jam, you are going

39:01.834 --> 39:05.142
to finish class, and then me,
you and Al will go

39:05.166 --> 39:06.476
up to the cabin, okay?

39:06.500 --> 39:07.851
We'll get our grown-up time on.

39:07.875 --> 39:09.309
Okay.

39:09.333 --> 39:12.184
And then we're going
to figure all this out. Okay?

39:12.208 --> 39:13.518
Yeah.

39:13.542 --> 39:16.643
Elise! You're not a robot after all.

39:16.667 --> 39:17.976
Don't rust your little robot parts.

39:18.000 --> 39:19.226
Okay.

39:19.250 --> 39:20.810
It'll be okay.
Okay.

39:20.834 --> 39:21.768
Can you finish class?
Yes.

39:21.792 --> 39:22.810
You okay?
Yeah.

39:22.834 --> 39:24.267
Go finish class.

39:24.291 --> 39:25.935
Do you want a lollipop?
No!

39:25.959 --> 39:26.893
Okay.

39:26.917 --> 39:27.976
Okay.

39:28.000 --> 39:31.540
Okay! Oh...

39:33.375 --> 39:37.810
I just don't get why you wouldn't tell us
the truth about why you came to camp.

39:37.834 --> 39:41.184
Well, A, I was trying
to forget about it, and B,

39:41.208 --> 39:42.851
it's embarrassing.

39:42.875 --> 39:45.684
No, the fact that you peed
your bunk until you were 11,

39:45.708 --> 39:47.017
that's embarrassing.

39:47.041 --> 39:49.351
That was a rough summer
to be bottom bunk.

39:49.375 --> 39:52.017
But you shouldn't
be embarrassed about this.

39:52.041 --> 39:56.142
You might want to rethink the company
that you keep, though. That's just a thought.

39:56.166 --> 39:57.939
You know, I should've
known that he was

39:57.963 --> 39:59.976
cheating on me. There
was never any problems.

40:00.000 --> 40:03.226
When there is no problem,
that's a problem.

40:03.250 --> 40:07.142
I just can't believe you were the
one to leak the Walker Paige photos.

40:07.166 --> 40:10.017
I mean, I always thought
he would make such a beautiful lesbian.

40:10.041 --> 40:13.684
Oh, speaking of, did I tell
you that I finally reread my book.

40:13.708 --> 40:14.893
Oh, it's bad.

40:14.917 --> 40:16.684
It's like epically awful.

40:16.708 --> 40:18.976
El, I'm sure it's not that bad.

40:19.000 --> 40:22.559
It's about a Loch Ness monster
that gets turned into a teenage boy

40:22.583 --> 40:26.351
and has to keep his mythical
secret from his girlfriend

40:26.375 --> 40:29.165
who turns out to be a centaur.

40:29.291 --> 40:31.059
Okay, that sounds like a hot mess.

40:31.083 --> 40:32.101
More like a hot Ness.

40:32.125 --> 40:33.309
Nice!

40:33.333 --> 40:35.184
That book sounds cen-taurded.

40:35.208 --> 40:37.017
Okay. Judges?

40:37.041 --> 40:38.684
Yeah, we're going to take it.

40:38.708 --> 40:44.393
But the most frustrating thing is that I don't
even like that YA fantasy romance crap,

40:44.417 --> 40:47.601
but it's like that's what's popular,
so I'll write it.

40:47.625 --> 40:49.393
Hot guy, good job, I'll marry it.

40:49.417 --> 40:52.267
Even if we're not
right for each other.

40:52.291 --> 40:54.059
He was too good for me.

40:54.083 --> 40:55.226
Elise.

40:55.250 --> 40:59.184
This guy cheated on you
two weeks before your wedding.

40:59.208 --> 41:03.434
Yeah, I know, the image of Vanessa
 is burned into my brain forever.

41:03.458 --> 41:07.393
But it's like I put on this
"I have my shit together" façade

41:07.417 --> 41:09.226
just to be good enough for him.

41:09.250 --> 41:11.810
Good enough for him?

41:11.834 --> 41:13.643
He was Ivy League.

41:13.667 --> 41:15.768
He wrote for Fortune Magazine.

41:15.792 --> 41:17.935
He had five percent body fat!

41:17.959 --> 41:18.935
That sounds boring.

41:18.959 --> 41:20.017
Mm-hmm.

41:20.041 --> 41:22.935
Look. El, stop. Stop it!

41:22.959 --> 41:25.226
El, look: all that's done now.

41:25.250 --> 41:27.184
So you can act however you want.

41:27.208 --> 41:29.393
You can write whatever you want.

41:29.417 --> 41:31.434
You can be whatever you want.

41:31.458 --> 41:34.142
I just want to be me.

41:34.166 --> 41:37.376
But like a happy version.

41:42.125 --> 41:44.976
Oh, that's just like a local goat cheese,
some fresh arugula

41:45.000 --> 41:47.476
from Eli's garden,
some thinly-sliced pickled beets

41:47.500 --> 41:50.601
that I did last week,
but it's basically a grilled cheese.

41:50.625 --> 41:53.184
And my mouth is basically pregnant.

41:53.208 --> 41:54.434
Oh, please.

41:54.458 --> 41:56.267
When did you become
such an iron chef?

41:56.291 --> 41:59.309
Oh, speaking of, I would totally do
that Bobby Flay one.

41:59.333 --> 42:02.309
Okay, you have officially been
at an all-girls camp for too long.

42:02.333 --> 42:04.643
No, I have a weakness
for the Irish.

42:04.667 --> 42:06.184
And a weakness for weird faces.

42:06.208 --> 42:08.184
And for the second course...

42:08.208 --> 42:10.976
Ooh, grandma's recipe?

42:28.208 --> 42:30.976
Oh, please, no. Please, no.

42:37.417 --> 42:39.017
You're flying!

42:39.041 --> 42:40.226
Flying!

42:40.250 --> 42:41.351
She's not even trying!

42:41.375 --> 42:43.476
I don't want to try!

43:29.083 --> 43:31.851
Because you were so good
at making stuff up, man.

43:31.875 --> 43:33.226
You remember the dance?

43:33.250 --> 43:35.226
No, I still do that dance.

43:35.250 --> 43:37.226
No, you don't.
No, you don't.

43:37.250 --> 43:39.226
Yes, I do. It totally -- no.

43:39.250 --> 43:40.726
Look. It went...

43:40.750 --> 43:44.559
♪♪ I hate it when the summer ends.
 Got to say goodbye to ♪

43:44.583 --> 43:47.017
♪ My best friends! ♪

43:47.041 --> 43:50.059
♪ Camp Takota, I love you so
and I don't know how the rest goes. ♪

43:50.083 --> 43:51.017
How'd it go?

43:51.041 --> 43:53.142
I just remember that
you end it in splits.

43:53.166 --> 43:54.101
Obviously. Signature move.

43:54.125 --> 43:55.935
Allison, where's the thing
for the thing?

43:55.959 --> 43:57.434
To the sink, by the kitchen.

43:57.458 --> 44:01.267
Will you help me move this?
 I want more room for my dance move.

44:01.291 --> 44:02.309
Oh, you got it, girl.

44:02.333 --> 44:05.476
Beep! Beep!

44:07.166 --> 44:08.935
What the hell are you doing?

44:08.959 --> 44:10.434
I don't know!

44:10.458 --> 44:14.267
He scared me, so I did the break
a beer bottle as a weapon thing.

44:14.291 --> 44:16.726
Jesus, Elise. This is a mountain,
not a 1980s street fight.

44:16.750 --> 44:19.267
I never knew you
were so ride or die.

44:19.291 --> 44:21.834
I'm sorry. You scared me,
and I guess this is how

44:21.858 --> 44:24.476
I react when someone scares
the onions out of me!

44:24.500 --> 44:25.935
What? What? What?

44:25.959 --> 44:26.768
I don't know.

44:26.792 --> 44:30.101
I just knocked and said,
"Anyone home?"

44:30.125 --> 44:31.601
You looked menacing!

44:31.625 --> 44:32.559
Your friend is crazy.

44:32.583 --> 44:35.309
Yeah, she is. Crazy, this is Eli.

44:35.333 --> 44:38.833
Eli, this is crazy,
sometimes known as Elise.

44:40.959 --> 44:42.643
I'm going to clean this up.

44:42.667 --> 44:45.601
It's a pleasure to meet you.

44:45.625 --> 44:46.643
No.. ooh!

44:46.667 --> 44:49.810
Oh! Oh, no!

44:49.834 --> 44:51.434
Oh. Oh, that looks pretty bad.

44:51.458 --> 44:54.476
Here, put some pressure on it.
Don't freak out!

44:54.500 --> 44:57.810
Okay, no. Okay, you know what?
We should probably take her to the infirmary.

44:57.834 --> 45:00.476
Alright, I'm going to drive,
because you two are blasted.

45:00.500 --> 45:02.476
It's debatable.

45:02.500 --> 45:04.518
Elise, hold down the fort
and we'll pick you up in the morning.

45:04.542 --> 45:05.643
Eli! Be a man!

45:05.667 --> 45:07.309
What do you want me to do?

45:07.333 --> 45:09.017
Grab her feet; she's choking me!
 Come on.

45:09.041 --> 45:10.017
Don't break anything else.

45:10.041 --> 45:12.184
You are heavy for your size.

45:12.208 --> 45:12.768
Goodnight.

45:12.792 --> 45:15.002
Ow! Ow.

45:28.208 --> 45:30.288
Wake up.

45:31.375 --> 45:34.245
Please don't punch me
in the face.

45:35.417 --> 45:37.957
Morning.

45:41.291 --> 45:44.381
I told Max I'd take you
back to camp.

45:44.959 --> 45:46.829
What's wrong?

45:48.583 --> 45:53.184
Well, based on the first
impression I gave you last night,

45:53.208 --> 45:56.918
I guess there is no need trying
to be cool now.

46:01.458 --> 46:04.128
You are a vision.

46:04.375 --> 46:06.101
And that is a lot of pee.

46:06.125 --> 46:08.665
You're a lot of pee!

46:10.959 --> 46:11.393
Get off me.

46:11.417 --> 46:14.167
Yep, still there.

46:28.250 --> 46:30.393
I'll get your clothes
back to you soon.

46:30.417 --> 46:32.434
Not worried about it.

46:35.792 --> 46:40.601
Only I could manage to look like the walk
of shame at an all-girls camp.

46:44.166 --> 46:46.226
Can I ask you
a question?

46:46.250 --> 46:47.810
Yeah, go for it.

46:47.834 --> 46:51.434
Aren't you a little old
to be a camp counselor?

46:52.291 --> 46:53.810
Wow!

46:53.834 --> 46:56.393
You are quite
the panty-dropper.

46:56.417 --> 46:58.643
Would you like to
know my weight, too?

46:58.667 --> 47:03.726
I'm just saying the campers
probably think that you're a narc.

47:03.750 --> 47:08.309
Well, yeah, it's how I get them
to give up their weed.

47:14.417 --> 47:15.893
Do you want to know the truth?

47:15.917 --> 47:16.476
Yeah.

47:16.500 --> 47:18.643
Okay.

47:21.500 --> 47:27.768
Well, I caught my fiancée cheating on me,

47:27.792 --> 47:30.462
and I got fired from my job.

47:30.959 --> 47:36.669
So I just wanted to get away
from my life for a few months.

47:37.500 --> 47:39.080
I'm really sorry.

47:40.291 --> 47:42.791
But that makes two of us.

47:44.125 --> 47:45.226
What do you mean?

47:45.250 --> 47:48.601
I built my farm with my now ex-wife.

47:48.625 --> 47:49.518
Oooh.

47:49.542 --> 47:50.643
Yeah.

47:50.667 --> 47:52.810
She wanted it as a getaway.

47:52.834 --> 47:56.434
But apparently she just
really wanted to get away...

47:56.458 --> 47:59.378
with my best friend, actually.

47:59.667 --> 48:01.518
Ooh, ouch.

48:01.542 --> 48:02.434
Yeah.

48:02.458 --> 48:04.628
Okay, you win.

48:05.708 --> 48:08.017
You know what?
I did actually kind of win.

48:08.041 --> 48:09.643
You know, she hated it here.

48:09.667 --> 48:14.434
She tried to like it, but she was just
more of a cover girl in coveralls, you know?

48:14.458 --> 48:15.601
Mm-hmm.

48:15.625 --> 48:18.893
And I got out of the divorce
with a really rad farm

48:18.917 --> 48:22.537
and some amazing  trust issues.

48:24.125 --> 48:26.184
I'm sorry; that was so stupid.

48:26.208 --> 48:28.668
No, no! It was funny.

48:28.708 --> 48:31.788
Does this laundry room come
with a two-drink minimum?

48:33.375 --> 48:36.684
Yeah, I actually don't know
what I'm saying at all right now.

48:36.708 --> 48:38.267
Just no idea.

48:38.291 --> 48:39.851
I think I'm...

48:39.875 --> 48:42.559
I think you make me
a little nervous.

48:42.583 --> 48:45.726
Well, being threatened with shards
of glass will do that to a person.

48:45.750 --> 48:48.726
Yeah.
No.

48:48.750 --> 48:53.080
Not "I'm scared of you" nervous,
but you are intimidating.

48:53.625 --> 48:56.017
Intimidating?

48:56.041 --> 48:58.726
You found me asleep
in my own urine?

48:58.750 --> 49:01.393
But you did it with such confidence;
it was beautiful.

49:01.417 --> 49:04.393
Yeah, I did.

49:04.417 --> 49:07.226
Well, if it'll make you feel any
less nervous, how about this?

49:07.250 --> 49:09.393
I have poison ivy
all over my crotch.

49:09.417 --> 49:10.726
Oh.
Wow.

49:10.750 --> 49:12.434
A lot.

49:12.458 --> 49:14.226
Now I officially pity you.

49:14.250 --> 49:16.518
I am so sorry.

49:16.542 --> 49:18.226
Exactly.

49:18.250 --> 49:20.130
I am a mess.

49:20.583 --> 49:23.434
I like it.

49:28.625 --> 49:35.625
Look, if you ever want someone
to talk to, I do a lot of night fishing.

49:35.959 --> 49:39.267
Maybe you can just give
me a couple of flashes off the dock

49:39.291 --> 49:41.601
and I will row over.

49:42.458 --> 49:45.059
What? What's so funny?

49:45.083 --> 49:49.101
Do you always ask girls
to flash you from across the lake?

49:49.125 --> 49:51.601
Flashes with a flashlight, perv.

49:51.625 --> 49:53.726
Oh! Oh!

49:53.750 --> 49:55.559
Right, right.

49:56.500 --> 50:00.309
Okay. Well, I'm going to leave now,
because you ruined the moment.

50:00.333 --> 50:00.935
What?

50:00.959 --> 50:03.329
Were we having a moment?

50:03.458 --> 50:04.309
I thought so.

50:04.333 --> 50:06.643
Well, warn me next time,
why don't you?

50:06.667 --> 50:08.267
Alright.

50:08.291 --> 50:11.267
I will see you later.
Narc.

50:11.291 --> 50:14.601
Goodbye.
Bye.

50:14.625 --> 50:17.205
Bye.

50:18.834 --> 50:19.935
Hello, Eli.

50:19.959 --> 50:22.499
Hey, Max.

50:28.041 --> 50:29.935
I peed
all over your blankets.

50:29.959 --> 50:30.935
Oh!

50:30.959 --> 50:32.309
Look at you!

50:32.333 --> 50:34.684
Finally acting
like your old self again.

50:34.708 --> 50:38.309
Did you apologize to Eli
for almost shivving him last night?

50:38.333 --> 50:40.309
Yeah, I'm sorry about that.

50:40.333 --> 50:41.601
Eli's cute, huh?

50:41.625 --> 50:43.684
Okay, Max.
Stop.

50:43.708 --> 50:48.518
The last thing I need is to invite
someone else into this crazy town.

50:48.542 --> 50:50.851
Well, actually, you guys
have a lot in common.

50:50.875 --> 50:52.059
Oh, obviously.

50:52.083 --> 50:55.293
You know how interested
I am in farming.

50:55.917 --> 50:58.017
What did you come
in here for?

50:58.041 --> 51:01.684
Well, I definitely didn't come
in to look at Chet through the window

51:01.708 --> 51:03.684
and crank this baby to spin cycle.

51:03.708 --> 51:04.935
And that's my cue.

51:04.959 --> 51:05.851
It's my favorite sport.

51:05.875 --> 51:07.017
Okay.

51:07.041 --> 51:09.631
I'm really
lonely!

51:12.333 --> 51:14.833
Hey, there,
my favorite sweat machine.

51:21.875 --> 51:23.726
Ah.
See, girls?

51:23.750 --> 51:27.267
Isn't it great to get out of the craft
hut and get some fresh air?

51:27.291 --> 51:29.768
No.
Fresh air's totes overrated.

51:29.792 --> 51:31.351
Okay.

51:31.375 --> 51:33.893
Well, you picked the wrong place
to be this summer.

51:33.917 --> 51:36.893
Duh. Next summer, I am staying home
and hanging by the pool.

51:36.917 --> 51:39.393
Oh, Sarah.

51:39.417 --> 51:43.684
This is the part of the conversation where I
ignore you and continue being in a good mood!

51:43.708 --> 51:45.059
I can respect that.

51:45.083 --> 51:47.810
Girls, look. That's where I had
my first-ever campout at Takota.

51:47.834 --> 51:49.393
Aww.

51:49.417 --> 51:50.726
Keep going!

51:50.750 --> 51:52.920
Sweet life tour.
Blech!

51:56.708 --> 51:59.559
I bet that's where
she saw the ghost.

52:10.542 --> 52:11.935
Hey, Chet.

52:11.959 --> 52:14.226
Max,
we have a problem.

52:14.250 --> 52:15.976
Are raccoons stealing
your sleeves again?

52:16.000 --> 52:17.559
No.

52:17.583 --> 52:19.673
Okay.

52:21.500 --> 52:22.601
Just, okay.

52:22.625 --> 52:25.935
The roof of the far east cabin
is in really rough shape

52:25.959 --> 52:27.810
to the point
it's falling in.

52:27.834 --> 52:29.726
Can we call it
a skylight?

52:29.750 --> 52:30.935
Okay.

52:30.959 --> 52:32.267
What is that?

52:32.291 --> 52:34.726
I'll just have them
camp-out tonight.

52:34.750 --> 52:39.893
Would you get whatever you need
from the hardware store?

52:39.917 --> 52:40.768
I caught it.

52:40.792 --> 52:43.422
I know.

52:50.291 --> 52:54.351
Does Mama
need some FiberNuts?

52:54.959 --> 52:57.379
Come on, Chet!

52:59.834 --> 53:01.476
Oh, no.

53:01.500 --> 53:04.017
We'll rip everything out and put
in brand new fiber-optic cable.

53:04.041 --> 53:05.643
Absolutely everything
will be state-of-the-art.

53:05.667 --> 53:07.309
Wait, what's Jared doing here?
I don't know.

53:07.333 --> 53:11.017
Everyone will have a camp-issued tablet
to ensure that everyone is in constant contact

53:11.041 --> 53:12.601
with each other without ever --

53:12.625 --> 53:13.643
What's he saying? Hush up.

53:13.667 --> 53:15.957
Kyle...

53:17.000 --> 53:18.643
What, are we looking for a contact?

53:18.667 --> 53:21.037
Shh!

53:23.000 --> 53:26.460
Oh, this is gross.

53:31.667 --> 53:33.957
Kyle?

53:35.333 --> 53:37.893
Now, the cabins have to be demo'd, obvi.

53:37.917 --> 53:40.643
And we'll put up
the dormitories instead.

53:40.667 --> 53:41.643
Where's the dormitory?

53:41.667 --> 53:42.684
It's right here, Kyle.

53:42.708 --> 53:44.184
Oh.

53:44.208 --> 53:48.017
Now, this modern architecture
along the waterfront, I can't.

53:48.041 --> 53:49.017
I can't even.

53:49.041 --> 53:51.017
I won't.

53:51.041 --> 53:53.810
Now, this entire wall will be plasma screens
displaying SME Twitter feeds,

53:53.834 --> 53:56.643
Reddit discussions, et cetera.

53:56.667 --> 53:58.309
It'll need a total gut-renovation.

53:58.333 --> 54:02.643
Bet you the food in here
will give you a gut renovation.

54:03.083 --> 54:04.976
Kyle, will you not?

54:05.000 --> 54:07.101
Now, let's go to the craft hut,

54:07.125 --> 54:09.851
A.K.A. the new "Gaming Nucleus
brought to you by Jared."

54:09.875 --> 54:12.535
Ooh.

54:14.834 --> 54:16.893
Okay.

54:16.917 --> 54:19.827
Now, before anybody freaks out --

54:22.250 --> 54:25.059
All the dirt must go,
and kill all the squirrels.

54:25.083 --> 54:27.726
And over there will be
a 4G tower, right there.

54:27.750 --> 54:28.393
Oh, wow.

54:28.417 --> 54:29.935
How would that look?
Right?

54:29.959 --> 54:31.726
Yes, it will be perfect.
Yes.

54:31.750 --> 54:32.434
Maxi-pad!

54:32.458 --> 54:33.393
Actually, it's Maxine now.

54:33.417 --> 54:35.518
People haven't called me
Maxi-pad in weeks, so.

54:35.542 --> 54:37.393
So nice to see you.

54:37.417 --> 54:41.017
Well, I wish I could say the same, Jared.
What the hell are you doing here?

54:41.041 --> 54:42.726
Didn't Mom tell you?

54:42.750 --> 54:44.810
After this year,
your kumbaya crap is over.

54:44.834 --> 54:46.059
What do you mean "over"?

54:46.083 --> 54:49.017
Over like that hairdo, honey.

54:49.041 --> 54:51.393
It's a side-pony,
and it's a classic, thank you.

54:51.417 --> 54:56.267
This hole will be turned into a place
to cultivate our future social media gurus.

54:56.291 --> 54:59.601
Camp Takota's going to be
a specialized digital and interactive camp.

54:59.625 --> 55:01.267
What?

55:01.291 --> 55:04.041
So you're going
to specialize in DIC?

55:05.125 --> 55:06.935
Mm-hmm.

55:06.959 --> 55:08.601
And it's going to be super-hard.

55:08.625 --> 55:10.434
So I doubt you can handle it.

55:10.458 --> 55:12.267
Ha! I would never
handle your DIC.

55:12.291 --> 55:14.101
I wouldn't go anywhere
near your DIC.

55:14.125 --> 55:16.810
Sounds like someone
needs to get laid. Oh!

55:16.834 --> 55:20.726
No, I do just fine
in that department, thank you.

55:21.083 --> 55:24.101
What are you doing?
What are you doing? What is that? A picture?

55:24.125 --> 55:26.476
Ice cold. You could hang
meat in that thing.

55:26.500 --> 55:28.893
Brr. Pork chops.

55:30.083 --> 55:31.059
Maxi-pad. What?!

55:31.083 --> 55:33.753
Just one more thing.

55:36.125 --> 55:38.476
What is that?
That's not even the middle finger.

55:38.500 --> 55:41.267
You're not worth the middle finger.

55:41.917 --> 55:45.077
Kyle, alley-oop to the Coop.

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
Here we are.

55:49.000 --> 55:51.040
Kyle!

56:06.125 --> 56:08.267
Let me guess:
you talked to my son.

56:08.291 --> 56:09.559
Is this for real?

56:09.583 --> 56:11.351
I'm afraid it is.

56:11.375 --> 56:15.810
Well, will you please explain it
to me while I fight off a panic attack?

56:15.834 --> 56:17.226
Oh, look, Max.

56:17.250 --> 56:21.893
As much as we don't like to think
of it as such, Takota is a business.

56:21.917 --> 56:25.559
And unfortunately, that business
hasn't been doing well for a long time now.

56:25.583 --> 56:27.017
How "not well"?

56:27.041 --> 56:29.851
Every year, less and less campers
come back to camp.

56:29.875 --> 56:33.476
Once these girls get a cell phone,
they would rather sit in their rooms

56:33.500 --> 56:37.017
in the dark all summer and Twitter
at each other than come back to camp.

56:37.041 --> 56:38.142
Okay.
Well, fine.

56:38.166 --> 56:40.518
We'll do a big sign-up tour
during the school year

56:40.542 --> 56:42.601
and we'll get
some fresh blood in here.

56:42.625 --> 56:44.351
I wish it were that simple, Max.

56:44.375 --> 56:47.851
Look. We operate in the off-season
off the money we acquire

56:47.875 --> 56:51.184
at the end of the summer
from preregistration for the next year,

56:51.208 --> 56:55.935
and Lord knows those numbers have
dropped completely off the charts.

56:55.959 --> 56:59.017
I've already taken out
a second mortgage on the land,

56:59.041 --> 57:01.601
and we're behind on that.

57:01.625 --> 57:03.059
How behind are we?

57:03.083 --> 57:07.726
I'm pretty sure the only person
we don't owe money to right now is you.

57:07.750 --> 57:09.059
Yeah, but Sally, come on.

57:09.083 --> 57:12.184
Jared is walking around this place
like he's going to turn it

57:12.208 --> 57:13.935
into the Starbucks of summer camp.

57:13.959 --> 57:18.226
Sweetie, as much as
I don't like his methods or his means or...

57:18.250 --> 57:22.393
even his general personality,
he's my son.

57:22.417 --> 57:24.267
I've seen the numbers.
It'll work.

57:24.291 --> 57:27.142
At least it'll still be
a camp and not condos.

57:27.166 --> 57:29.935
It might as well be condos.

57:29.959 --> 57:33.059
How many preregistrations would it
take to keep us afloat until next summer?

57:33.083 --> 57:35.059
Oh, Maxine, I know
this is tough.

57:35.083 --> 57:37.893
If my mother knew I was closing
her camp doors --

57:37.917 --> 57:40.393
Sally, how many?

57:40.417 --> 57:43.643
To cover the current mortgage,
all of our creditors --

57:43.667 --> 57:46.997
Sally, just ballpark it.
Please.

57:47.125 --> 57:48.893
Half.

57:48.917 --> 57:52.327
Half the camp would
have to preregister.

57:52.792 --> 57:55.002
Done.

57:55.166 --> 57:56.810
Max, we never had those numbers.

57:56.834 --> 57:58.643
Not even in the glory days.

57:58.667 --> 58:01.747
Sally, is it a deal?

58:04.750 --> 58:06.810
Back to work.

58:06.834 --> 58:09.714
I love you, sweetie.

58:50.333 --> 58:53.142
Hi, you've reached Kathy
and -- say "Bruce," babe.

58:53.166 --> 58:54.643
Bruce!

58:54.667 --> 58:57.101
We're out of the country
with extremely limited access

58:57.125 --> 59:00.684
to phone or email,
because we're in Paris.

59:37.500 --> 59:40.017
Oh, it worked.

59:42.208 --> 59:43.476
Ooh!

59:43.500 --> 59:45.101
Be cool.

59:45.125 --> 59:47.351
Be cool.

01:00:07.250 --> 01:00:08.101
Hey.

01:00:08.125 --> 01:00:09.559
Hi.

01:00:09.583 --> 01:00:11.226
So that took a long time.

01:00:11.250 --> 01:00:15.226
Yeah. I kind of underestimated
the whole thing.

01:00:17.041 --> 01:00:19.393
So, where's everybody at?

01:00:19.417 --> 01:00:20.768
They're in their bunks.

01:00:20.792 --> 01:00:22.017
It's 8:00, though.

01:00:22.041 --> 01:00:24.434
Isn't it great?

01:00:24.458 --> 01:00:26.768
I have a favor that I need to ask.

01:00:26.792 --> 01:00:28.101
But can we go somewhere else?

01:00:28.125 --> 01:00:31.267
Because the mosquitos have
literally taken a pint of my blood.

01:00:31.291 --> 01:00:33.434
Because that took
a long time.

01:00:33.458 --> 01:00:34.893
Okay, I'm sorry.

01:00:34.917 --> 01:00:35.601
Uh-huh.

01:00:35.625 --> 01:00:37.184
I thought it would be romantic.

01:00:37.208 --> 01:00:37.810
Not really.

01:00:37.834 --> 01:00:39.935
But I came over in a boat.

01:00:39.959 --> 01:00:42.226
Yeah, but I've
seen The Notebook.

01:00:42.250 --> 01:00:45.393
So don't be surprised if you do see
any campers down here.

01:00:45.417 --> 01:00:48.893
This is where all the older girls like
to come smoke cigarettes,

01:00:48.917 --> 01:00:52.267
because they think
it makes them so cool.

01:00:52.291 --> 01:00:55.101
I see the poison ivy is clearing up.

01:00:55.125 --> 01:00:56.434
Oh, no.

01:00:56.458 --> 01:00:59.101
This is just how I walk.

01:00:59.125 --> 01:01:01.101
It's pretty sexy, huh?

01:01:01.125 --> 01:01:03.101
Yeah.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.309
Would you mail these for me?

01:01:06.333 --> 01:01:09.434
There's a camper who's not getting
any mail, and she's a little homesick,

01:01:09.458 --> 01:01:13.128
so I'm going to pretend
that these are from her parents.

01:01:14.208 --> 01:01:15.309
What?

01:01:15.333 --> 01:01:18.393
She's like
our little camp underdog.

01:01:18.417 --> 01:01:19.518
No, it's...

01:01:19.542 --> 01:01:21.810
it's just really sweet.

01:01:21.834 --> 01:01:25.964
Well, surprise: I'm not all
broken bottles and hangovers.

01:01:30.166 --> 01:01:33.536
This might be a weird note
to get from your parent.

01:01:36.458 --> 01:01:37.643
Yeah.
Sorry.

01:01:37.667 --> 01:01:40.935
So have you ever thought
about investing in like a speedboat?

01:01:40.959 --> 01:01:42.476
Okay.
You can let it go.

01:01:42.500 --> 01:01:45.017
I know it took a while.

01:01:45.125 --> 01:01:47.455
So did you call him?

01:01:49.291 --> 01:01:49.976
No, no.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.434
That ship has sailed.

01:01:52.458 --> 01:01:55.309
I could probably call him
and tell him that,

01:01:55.333 --> 01:01:58.851
but I think it's more fun
to torture him.

01:01:58.875 --> 01:02:01.393
Well, remind me not to cross you.

01:02:01.417 --> 01:02:03.226
No,
I'm a great girlfriend.

01:02:03.250 --> 01:02:04.351
Really?

01:02:04.375 --> 01:02:05.601
Oh, yeah.
The best.

01:02:05.625 --> 01:02:10.035
I will change like a chameleon
just to make my boyfriend happy.

01:02:11.166 --> 01:02:13.017
Yeah.

01:02:13.041 --> 01:02:15.501
I'm pretty great.

01:02:16.917 --> 01:02:19.142
Well, you can definitely
knock that off.

01:02:19.166 --> 01:02:23.226
Because I think you're
pretty awesome as-is.

01:02:23.250 --> 01:02:24.351
Really?

01:02:24.375 --> 01:02:25.851
Yeah, really.

01:02:25.875 --> 01:02:28.035
And you're pretty hilarious.

01:02:29.041 --> 01:02:31.421
And you're pretty.

01:02:33.917 --> 01:02:38.643
Well, you're not that too bad either.

01:02:38.667 --> 01:02:40.267
What?

01:02:40.291 --> 01:02:42.059
Okay, that wasn't even a sentence.

01:02:42.083 --> 01:02:43.476
I tried a sentence.

01:02:43.500 --> 01:02:44.726
Slow down
on the compliments.

01:02:44.750 --> 01:02:46.559
I made an attempt at a sentence.

01:02:46.583 --> 01:02:48.101
Hey, Elise? Sorry, guys.

01:02:48.125 --> 01:02:50.059
Max needs us in the mess hall.

01:02:50.083 --> 01:02:51.851
Okay.

01:02:51.875 --> 01:02:54.226
Thank you for ruining a moment.

01:02:54.250 --> 01:02:56.601
We were having a moment?

01:02:56.625 --> 01:02:58.434
That was a moment.

01:02:58.458 --> 01:02:59.518
Stop.

01:02:59.542 --> 01:03:00.684
That was a moment!

01:03:00.708 --> 01:03:01.726
Don't forget the letters.

01:03:01.750 --> 01:03:04.267
Don't forget your manners.

01:03:04.291 --> 01:03:05.184
Thank you.

01:03:05.208 --> 01:03:06.559
You're welcome.

01:03:06.583 --> 01:03:09.083
Goodnight.

01:03:11.542 --> 01:03:14.082
That was definitely a moment.

01:03:15.583 --> 01:03:17.601
So that's the situation.

01:03:17.625 --> 01:03:21.434
We need to secure a 50 percent
return rate by the end of camp,

01:03:21.458 --> 01:03:24.017
or the Takota we know
and love will cease to exist.

01:03:24.041 --> 01:03:25.267
Yes.

01:03:25.291 --> 01:03:27.101
How much is 50 percent?

01:03:27.125 --> 01:03:28.768
112.

01:03:28.792 --> 01:03:31.267
And how many did
we have last year?

01:03:31.291 --> 01:03:33.501
27.

01:03:36.333 --> 01:03:39.726
Guys, I know that doesn't sound good,
but I'm not going to let Jared

01:03:39.750 --> 01:03:41.476
come in here
and destroy this place.

01:03:41.500 --> 01:03:42.434
And then what?

01:03:42.458 --> 01:03:46.267
Next summer, instead
of campfires and archery,

01:03:46.291 --> 01:03:48.601
our campers are at home
experimenting with drugs

01:03:48.625 --> 01:03:49.768
and back-alley abortions.

01:03:49.792 --> 01:03:52.142
Okay. These girls are
from the suburbs.

01:03:52.166 --> 01:03:53.601
Exactly.

01:03:53.625 --> 01:03:55.393
I'm not going
to let that happen.

01:03:55.417 --> 01:03:58.184
I want every camper
back here next summer.

01:03:58.208 --> 01:04:01.476
Well, I don't mean
to be a downer,

01:04:01.500 --> 01:04:03.309
but this camp is in rough shape.

01:04:03.333 --> 01:04:05.643
Most of the cabins are
just a stack of splinters.

01:04:05.667 --> 01:04:07.309
Chet?

01:04:07.333 --> 01:04:12.043
Please shut your beautiful,
beautiful face.

01:04:13.500 --> 01:04:15.309
Look.

01:04:15.333 --> 01:04:17.643
I know that Takota isn't
the prettiest girl at the dance.

01:04:17.667 --> 01:04:20.976
But she's our girl,

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.810
and I don't want Jared getting
his creepy hands on her.

01:04:23.834 --> 01:04:25.643
So what can we do?

01:04:25.667 --> 01:04:28.684
Okay. Visitors Day is in two weeks,
and that is our best shot

01:04:28.708 --> 01:04:30.976
at getting parents
to fork over the cash.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:35.851
I know we don't have a lot of time, and
I spent way too much time on those graphs.

01:04:35.875 --> 01:04:39.518
But I really think we can get this place
looking and feeling like a million bucks.

01:04:39.542 --> 01:04:41.502
So who's in?

01:04:44.375 --> 01:04:46.684
That was supposed to be
more of a rousing speech.

01:04:46.708 --> 01:04:48.226
Let's do it!

01:04:48.250 --> 01:04:51.810
Thank you!
High-five!

01:04:51.834 --> 01:04:53.810
Chet, your hands are too large.

01:04:53.834 --> 01:04:55.351
And too slow.

01:04:55.375 --> 01:04:57.393
Well, I didn't want
to do it anyway.

01:04:57.417 --> 01:04:58.643
Okay. That's a lie.

01:04:58.667 --> 01:05:00.684
Teamwork. Oh, wow.

01:05:02.542 --> 01:05:03.810
Yeah!

01:05:03.834 --> 01:05:06.393
Good job.

01:05:33.792 --> 01:05:34.810
Wow.

01:05:34.834 --> 01:05:36.184
These are new recipes.

01:05:36.208 --> 01:05:38.393
Squash, chicken, and the new tots.

01:05:38.417 --> 01:05:40.476
Ooh.

01:05:43.375 --> 01:05:45.684
It's so good!

01:06:32.291 --> 01:06:35.810
And then when we're done, we're going
to have some really cool friendship bracelets

01:06:35.834 --> 01:06:39.101
that we can give to our moms
tomorrow at Visitors Day!

01:06:39.125 --> 01:06:42.559
Elise, there's a phone
call in the office for you.

01:06:42.583 --> 01:06:46.142
Can you just take a message? There's
only a couple minutes left of this class.

01:06:46.166 --> 01:06:47.684
Already tried.
She's not having it.

01:06:47.708 --> 01:06:49.828
Her name is Celia something.

01:06:51.750 --> 01:06:55.810
I'm on my way.

01:06:55.834 --> 01:06:58.684
Melinda, can I put you in charge
for the last couple minutes?

01:06:58.708 --> 01:07:00.788
Sure.

01:07:07.750 --> 01:07:08.935
Hello?

01:07:08.959 --> 01:07:10.768
Elise, how are you?

01:07:10.792 --> 01:07:12.226
It's Celia.

01:07:12.250 --> 01:07:13.309
Good.

01:07:13.333 --> 01:07:14.851
Let me get right to the point.

01:07:14.875 --> 01:07:18.601
You're obviously aware of the media
frenzy your little "oops" unleashed.

01:07:18.625 --> 01:07:20.267
Actually, no.

01:07:20.291 --> 01:07:23.142
I've kind of
unplugged this summer.

01:07:23.166 --> 01:07:25.059
Well, allow me
to catch you up.

01:07:25.083 --> 01:07:28.017
Since that photo leaked, sales for the
Midnight Moonlight series

01:07:28.041 --> 01:07:29.935
have more than quadrupled.

01:07:29.959 --> 01:07:30.976
Wait, what?

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.559
Two words: cougar appeal.

01:07:33.583 --> 01:07:36.684
It's not just preteen girls buying the
books; now housewives across the nation

01:07:36.708 --> 01:07:39.828
are lusting after Walker, too.

01:07:39.875 --> 01:07:42.017
Well, congratulations.

01:07:42.041 --> 01:07:45.559
Still don't know
what this has to do with me.

01:07:45.583 --> 01:07:47.476
Walker is writing a memoir.

01:07:47.500 --> 01:07:48.768
Isn't he like 16?

01:07:48.792 --> 01:07:50.684
No, he's completely legal.

01:07:50.708 --> 01:07:52.748
Ooh.

01:07:53.667 --> 01:07:58.518
I'm calling because I would like you to
come back and take point on this.

01:07:58.542 --> 01:08:02.351
In fact,
Walker insists.

01:08:02.375 --> 01:08:07.309
So hop on the earliest flight back tonight
so I can have you here tomorrow morning.

01:08:07.333 --> 01:08:08.393
Tomorrow?

01:08:08.417 --> 01:08:11.476
I'm kind of in the middle
of something right now.

01:08:11.500 --> 01:08:16.725
Oh, and Elise,
I read "Un-Loch My Heart."

01:08:16.750 --> 01:08:20.100
Looks like we could have
a serious franchise on our hands.

01:08:20.125 --> 01:08:23.017
I'll see you
at 9:00 a.m. sharp.

01:08:44.625 --> 01:08:46.100
Hey.

01:08:46.125 --> 01:08:48.893
Do you have any
paint pens in here?

01:08:48.917 --> 01:08:50.309
Yeah. They're on the shelf.

01:08:50.332 --> 01:08:52.883
Thank God.

01:08:54.332 --> 01:08:55.935
You okay?

01:08:55.959 --> 01:08:58.100
Yeah, I'm just tired.

01:08:58.125 --> 01:09:01.434
Elise, can you do a quick spot
check of the mess hall tonight?

01:09:01.457 --> 01:09:02.475
Yeah.

01:09:02.500 --> 01:09:05.350
And then if you could go
to the older campers' bunk

01:09:05.375 --> 01:09:09.434
and just make sure it's ot a mess,
that'd be awesome. And if there are any

01:09:09.457 --> 01:09:11.810
Max, can you just stop?
Just for a second.

01:09:11.834 --> 01:09:14.059
What's the matter?

01:09:14.082 --> 01:09:17.434
I don't think I'm going
to be able to do all of that.

01:09:17.457 --> 01:09:18.518
I know, I know.

01:09:18.542 --> 01:09:20.600
I'm asking you
guys to do so much.

01:09:20.625 --> 01:09:22.935
There's just like
so much left to do.

01:09:22.959 --> 01:09:25.267
And meanwhile, the 13-year-olds now,
they're sticking tater tots

01:09:25.291 --> 01:09:27.893
down each other's butt cracks
and calling it "tater slots."

01:09:27.917 --> 01:09:29.935
Like is that what
people do for fun now?

01:09:29.959 --> 01:09:32.100
No, Max.

01:09:32.125 --> 01:09:35.434
I don't think I'm going
to be able to do all of that stuff

01:09:35.457 --> 01:09:37.725
because I won't be here.

01:09:37.750 --> 01:09:40.059
I'm going
to leave camp tonight.

01:09:40.082 --> 01:09:42.975
Okay, seriously, Elise,
You're lying is getting

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.017
like Allison-level good.

01:09:45.041 --> 01:09:48.600
I'm serious.

01:09:48.625 --> 01:09:50.850
Okay, guys.
Let's all pack it up.

01:09:50.875 --> 01:09:54.495
We'll take it down to the mess hall
and we'll hang it.

01:10:03.792 --> 01:10:05.935
What the hell are
you talking about?

01:10:05.959 --> 01:10:11.101
My old boss, Celia,
she offered me my job back.

01:10:11.125 --> 01:10:13.726
So I have to be
in Chicago tomorrow.

01:10:13.750 --> 01:10:16.851
Look, she read my book
and she liked it and she --

01:10:16.875 --> 01:10:18.851
Oh, the book
that you don't even like?

01:10:18.875 --> 01:10:19.851
That one?

01:10:19.875 --> 01:10:24.017
Okay, Max, I don't
expect you to understand.

01:10:24.041 --> 01:10:29.476
But I have been waiting for --
working for this for literally years.

01:10:29.500 --> 01:10:32.684
No, Elise, I understand.

01:10:32.708 --> 01:10:36.017
I understand that all that
"I just want to be me" talk

01:10:36.041 --> 01:10:36.851
was bullshit.

01:10:36.875 --> 01:10:37.893
Max.

01:10:37.917 --> 01:10:39.351
No, seriously.

01:10:39.375 --> 01:10:41.851
Have fun pretending
to be perfect.

01:10:41.875 --> 01:10:45.184
Maybe when you're back in Chicago,
you can babysit for Jeff and Vanessa.

01:10:45.208 --> 01:10:47.309
Whoa.
That's a little harsh.

01:10:47.333 --> 01:10:50.684
No, I don't really care, Allison, because
I've never seen someone act so selfish

01:10:50.708 --> 01:10:53.038
in my entire life.

01:10:53.125 --> 01:10:55.184
Wait, I'm selfish?

01:10:55.208 --> 01:10:57.017
Yeah, you are.

01:10:57.041 --> 01:10:58.059
I'm being selfish.

01:10:58.083 --> 01:10:59.601
Thank you
for admitting that, Elise.

01:10:59.625 --> 01:11:01.059
Hey, guys, let's
take a deep breath.

01:11:01.083 --> 01:11:06.393
This entire thing that we're doing is so
that you can get your promotion.

01:11:06.417 --> 01:11:08.684
So don't you dare
call me selfish.

01:11:08.708 --> 01:11:10.684
Wow!

01:11:10.708 --> 01:11:13.518
Wow,
that is really low, Elise.

01:11:13.542 --> 01:11:14.893
Because you know what?

01:11:14.917 --> 01:11:18.434
If I remember correctly, two months ago
when you didn't have anything,

01:11:18.458 --> 01:11:20.726
where did you go?
Hmm?

01:11:20.750 --> 01:11:23.059
Oh, right: you came here.

01:11:23.083 --> 01:11:26.559
And now I'm selfish because I'm
working my ass off to make sure

01:11:26.583 --> 01:11:28.768
that this place still exists?

01:11:28.792 --> 01:11:33.351
So that when you screw up in a couple
years, you actually have a place to turn to.

01:11:33.375 --> 01:11:35.184
Thank you for the
vote of confidence.

01:11:35.208 --> 01:11:37.142
And this isn't
just for me, Elise.

01:11:37.166 --> 01:11:40.309
This is for Sally and for the kids
and for Allison.

01:11:40.333 --> 01:11:44.142
Oh, the best thing that could happen
to Allison is if this place gets shut down.

01:11:44.166 --> 01:11:47.434
What are you talking about?

01:11:47.458 --> 01:11:48.935
What is she talking about,
Allison?

01:11:48.959 --> 01:11:50.684
I don't know.

01:11:50.708 --> 01:11:55.976
She's talking about the fact that she
got accepted to a culinary school in Chicago.

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:57.768
And she's never going to go.

01:11:57.792 --> 01:11:59.101
Because she's scared of you.

01:11:59.125 --> 01:12:00.893
She always has been.

01:12:00.917 --> 01:12:03.787
Because Maxine,
you're a control freak!

01:12:04.542 --> 01:12:07.042
Is that true?

01:12:07.834 --> 01:12:09.935
Alright, you can get
your shit from the office.

01:12:09.959 --> 01:12:11.559
I'm done.

01:12:11.583 --> 01:12:13.101
Max?

01:12:22.291 --> 01:12:24.142
Elise, what the hell?

01:12:24.166 --> 01:12:25.267
I read the letters.

01:12:25.291 --> 01:12:27.059
So what?

01:12:27.083 --> 01:12:30.142
That gives you the right to start
making decisions on my behalf?

01:12:30.166 --> 01:12:33.142
Where have you been
for the last eight years?

01:12:33.166 --> 01:12:36.309
Allison, don't do this.
Stop.

01:12:36.333 --> 01:12:39.753
You're the last person
I need life advice from.

01:13:05.208 --> 01:13:06.810
Eli!

01:13:06.834 --> 01:13:08.810
Eli!

01:13:19.708 --> 01:13:21.184
Hey, narc.

01:13:21.208 --> 01:13:24.351
Hey, can I borrow your phone?
I need to call a cab.

01:13:24.375 --> 01:13:27.851
It might take a while. Nearest cab's
like a hundred miles away.

01:13:27.875 --> 01:13:31.017
Okay, well then, will you drive me
to the closest train station

01:13:31.041 --> 01:13:32.810
or bus station or anything
that will take me away from here?

01:13:32.834 --> 01:13:36.101
What's going on?
Are you alright?

01:13:36.125 --> 01:13:40.810
Yeah, I got my old job back.
I'm going back to Chicago.

01:13:40.834 --> 01:13:43.059
Okay.

01:13:43.083 --> 01:13:44.267
You're joking.

01:13:44.291 --> 01:13:47.059
Right?

01:13:52.875 --> 01:13:55.165
You're not.

01:13:56.041 --> 01:13:59.559
Okay, well, what
about saving Takota?

01:13:59.583 --> 01:14:01.351
You're just going
to bail on Max?

01:14:01.375 --> 01:14:07.559
Look, Eli, this has been really fun,
but let's not kid ourselves.

01:14:07.583 --> 01:14:11.935
Sooner or later, I was going
to have to go back to the real world.

01:14:11.959 --> 01:14:13.999
Right.

01:14:14.250 --> 01:14:19.518
It's weird, because this
is the real world to me.

01:14:19.542 --> 01:14:21.922
And everything about this...

01:14:23.417 --> 01:14:26.142
was real to me, too.

01:14:28.834 --> 01:14:31.309
Get another ride, Elise.

01:14:41.750 --> 01:14:42.893
Chet?

01:14:42.917 --> 01:14:44.810
I need a ride!

01:14:44.834 --> 01:14:47.643
Okay.

01:15:03.250 --> 01:15:05.476
Is it true?

01:15:05.500 --> 01:15:06.976
That you don't want
to be here?

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.460
No.
No.

01:15:10.125 --> 01:15:13.309
I mean,
I don't know.

01:15:13.333 --> 01:15:14.976
This is my home.

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:16.476
Everything I know
is here.

01:15:16.500 --> 01:15:20.434
But yeah,
sometimes I do wonder.

01:15:20.458 --> 01:15:23.768
Then Allison, why wouldn't you just,
you know, say something to me about it?

01:15:23.792 --> 01:15:24.976
Oh, come on, Maxine.

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:26.267
I know exactly
what you'd say.

01:15:26.291 --> 01:15:30.101
You'd say that I would hate the city,
because God knows you do.

01:15:30.125 --> 01:15:32.434
Every summer you just
bolt right out of there.

01:15:32.458 --> 01:15:33.768
That is so not true.

01:15:33.792 --> 01:15:35.476
Yes, it is.

01:15:35.500 --> 01:15:37.810
Okay, let me explain
something to you.

01:15:37.834 --> 01:15:40.309
I'm not running
away from somewhere.

01:15:40.333 --> 01:15:43.309
I'm running to somewhere.
To camp.

01:15:43.333 --> 01:15:47.851
Because this is what I love,
and this is what makes me happy.

01:15:47.875 --> 01:15:52.518
So if culinary school is going to make you feel
the same way that this place makes me feel,

01:15:52.542 --> 01:15:56.332
then Allison, get the hell out
of here.

01:15:58.250 --> 01:16:01.226
Okay, but what if
I hate it there?

01:16:01.250 --> 01:16:02.351
What if I suck?

01:16:02.375 --> 01:16:04.351
Please.

01:16:04.375 --> 01:16:06.851
You are like the Good Will Hunting
of culinary arts.

01:16:06.875 --> 01:16:08.851
Please.
Make my cookies.

01:16:08.875 --> 01:16:10.434
Okay.

01:16:10.458 --> 01:16:14.918
I'm going to eat all of them,
and you're not going to eat shit.

01:16:34.458 --> 01:16:37.684
I don't know what the circumstances are
that brought you back to us,

01:16:37.708 --> 01:16:41.935
but I'm sure glad
you're here.

01:17:29.166 --> 01:17:32.101
"Dear Elise, thank you
for being my friend.

01:17:32.125 --> 01:17:34.810
I had so much fun
this summer.

01:17:34.834 --> 01:17:37.226
I don't want to go home yet.

01:17:37.250 --> 01:17:38.309
Love, Penny."

01:17:38.333 --> 01:17:42.059
Now boarding bus 57 to Chicago.

01:18:31.291 --> 01:18:33.476
Hey.

01:18:33.500 --> 01:18:35.684
Way to go, girl.

01:18:35.708 --> 01:18:36.976
It's pretty great, isn't it?

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:38.351
It sure is. Look...

01:18:38.375 --> 01:18:44.075
whatever happens today, you are
going to be an amazing camp director.

01:18:44.417 --> 01:18:46.393
I was just hoping
it would be here.

01:18:46.417 --> 01:18:48.184
Thank you, Sally.

01:18:48.208 --> 01:18:50.559
I'm still holding out hope.

01:18:51.583 --> 01:18:52.643
Oh, I need some Kleenex.

01:18:52.667 --> 01:18:55.207
Go.
Get out of here.

01:18:56.375 --> 01:18:57.810
Jared.

01:18:57.834 --> 01:18:59.518
Didn't know that you'd be
joining us today.

01:18:59.542 --> 01:19:02.476
Oh, hell to the yes.

01:19:03.166 --> 01:19:04.017
Kyle.

01:19:04.041 --> 01:19:05.142
Sorry.
Sorry.

01:19:05.166 --> 01:19:07.684
I want to see this Maxi-pad
replaced with a tampon.

01:19:07.708 --> 01:19:11.643
So I take it you're referring to
yourself as a tampon now?

01:19:11.667 --> 01:19:13.226
Hmm?

01:19:13.250 --> 01:19:15.184
I'm slim.

01:19:15.208 --> 01:19:16.726
And I'm out for blood.

01:19:16.750 --> 01:19:18.309
Okay, that's gross.

01:19:18.333 --> 01:19:22.017
Look, as much as I'd like to stand
here and listen to your prepared insults,

01:19:22.041 --> 01:19:23.559
I actually have
a camp to run.

01:19:23.583 --> 01:19:25.923
Oh, but wait.

01:19:28.417 --> 01:19:30.627
I deserve the middle finger.

01:19:31.250 --> 01:19:33.920
I'm worth the middle finger!

01:19:43.500 --> 01:19:44.393
Okay.

01:19:44.417 --> 01:19:45.601
It's hot.

01:19:45.625 --> 01:19:48.351
And my pedicure
is completely ruined.

01:19:48.375 --> 01:19:49.976
Places.

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:50.559
Hey, everybody.

01:19:50.583 --> 01:19:52.226
Welcome to Visitors Day!

01:19:52.250 --> 01:19:54.768
We are super excited
to have you all here.

01:19:54.792 --> 01:19:58.434
In the spirit of old and new,
we're going to be performing a song

01:19:58.458 --> 01:20:01.976
that I wrote with my two best friends
back when I was a camper here.

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:03.920
Hope you enjoy!

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:26.434

That was fun.

01:22:04.792 --> 01:22:06.893
Hard to believe
it's closing campfire, huh?

01:22:06.917 --> 01:22:08.267
Are summers getting shorter?

01:22:08.291 --> 01:22:11.726
Why don't you lead this one?

01:22:11.750 --> 01:22:14.080
Are you sure?

01:22:14.583 --> 01:22:17.267
Thanks.

01:22:20.083 --> 01:22:23.726
Every year, we close out the summer
with one final campfire.

01:22:23.750 --> 01:22:27.559
It's a chance to reflect
on what an amazing summer it's been

01:22:27.583 --> 01:22:30.851
and all the memories you'll hold onto
until you're back here next summer

01:22:30.875 --> 01:22:32.393
for opening campfire.

01:22:32.417 --> 01:22:33.393
No!
No, no, no.

01:22:33.417 --> 01:22:34.351
No, no, no, no.

01:22:34.375 --> 01:22:36.893
There will be no opening
campfire next year.

01:22:36.917 --> 01:22:39.059
A yule log DVD at best.

01:22:39.083 --> 01:22:43.184
Because -- drumroll, Kyle --

01:22:44.250 --> 01:22:46.643
I'm taking over camp.

01:22:46.667 --> 01:22:50.059
Yep, I'm finally giving this place
a long-overdue makeover.

01:22:50.083 --> 01:22:56.559
I'm bringing this hole
into the 21st century.

01:22:56.583 --> 01:22:57.351
Thank you.

01:22:57.375 --> 01:22:59.455
You're welcome.

01:23:01.458 --> 01:23:02.267
Okay.

01:23:02.291 --> 01:23:04.631
Yep.
No.

01:23:06.834 --> 01:23:08.434
It's true.

01:23:08.458 --> 01:23:11.726
Jared might be taking
over next summer.

01:23:11.750 --> 01:23:15.309
And you'll be updating
your statuses from the mess hall

01:23:15.333 --> 01:23:18.893
and live tweeting the campfires.

01:23:18.917 --> 01:23:22.309
And all your friends back home
will know how awesome this place is.

01:23:22.333 --> 01:23:24.503
But who wants that?

01:23:26.500 --> 01:23:32.250
Since I was eight years old, this place
has been like an old friend to me.

01:23:32.834 --> 01:23:39.464
We have all our inside jokes
and the songs that only we know.

01:23:40.667 --> 01:23:43.810
And you go back home
and you try to tell people about camp,

01:23:43.834 --> 01:23:47.464
and you end up just saying,
"You had to be there."

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:56.476
Well, I really hope...

01:23:56.500 --> 01:24:00.330
that there's still going to
be a place you have to be.

01:24:01.834 --> 01:24:05.634
Because I'm not ready to say
goodbye to this friend yet.

01:24:12.542 --> 01:24:14.351
Okay.

01:24:14.375 --> 01:24:16.535
Sorry.

01:24:17.208 --> 01:24:21.643
Tonight we are so honored
to have with us a very special guest

01:24:21.667 --> 01:24:26.559
at Takota to read our Takota campfire
ghost story.

01:24:26.583 --> 01:24:29.851
He is the New York Times
bestselling author

01:24:29.875 --> 01:24:32.309
of such thrillers as --

01:24:32.333 --> 01:24:33.851
Hey.

01:24:33.875 --> 01:24:36.726
Elise.

01:24:36.750 --> 01:24:38.518
Eli, I just...

01:24:38.542 --> 01:24:42.684
I really wanted to say
that I am so sorry.

01:24:42.708 --> 01:24:47.059
I was just really
mean to you yesterday.

01:24:47.083 --> 01:24:50.559
I mean, like I was
straight up a bitch.

01:24:50.583 --> 01:24:51.893
Okay, well,
I wouldn't say that.

01:24:51.917 --> 01:24:54.377
No, I was.

01:24:55.417 --> 01:24:57.267
Maybe a little.

01:24:57.291 --> 01:25:00.059
Look, I thought
about what you said.

01:25:00.083 --> 01:25:04.393
And you were right:
this has been fun.

01:25:07.083 --> 01:25:09.893
But Elise, I want it
to keep being fun.

01:25:09.917 --> 01:25:12.601
Eli Morton.

01:25:12.625 --> 01:25:13.309
Eli...

01:25:13.333 --> 01:25:16.059
That smell.
What is that?

01:25:16.083 --> 01:25:17.893
I slept in a bus station last night.

01:25:17.917 --> 01:25:19.351
Gross.

01:25:19.375 --> 01:25:22.393
He's going to be great
at this if he ever --

01:25:22.417 --> 01:25:23.935
Eli,
Max just intro'd you.

01:25:23.959 --> 01:25:25.601
Hi.
Welcome.

01:25:25.625 --> 01:25:26.893
Give him a round
of applause, everybody.

01:25:26.917 --> 01:25:28.518
Excuse me.
Thank you.

01:25:28.542 --> 01:25:30.518
Break a leg.

01:25:32.959 --> 01:25:34.059
He's a writer?

01:25:34.083 --> 01:25:35.768
Yeah.

01:25:35.792 --> 01:25:38.893
And a local farmer.

01:25:38.917 --> 01:25:41.537
Look: technically,
I didn't lie to you.

01:25:48.250 --> 01:25:51.059
So to this day,
Takota campers

01:25:51.083 --> 01:25:52.768
can still see the ghost.

01:25:52.792 --> 01:25:55.559
You see,
he's attracted to the fire.

01:25:55.583 --> 01:25:56.935
He's drawn to the smoke.

01:25:56.959 --> 01:26:00.601
Much like the campfire
we have going on right now.

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:09.768
So when you Takota girls build
your campfires for s'mores

01:26:09.792 --> 01:26:12.768
and stories

01:26:14.166 --> 01:26:17.267
just remember: you might have an
extra visitor at your campout that night.

01:26:17.291 --> 01:26:20.976
What was that?
Somebody call 9-1-1.

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.476
I'm not getting any service.

01:26:25.667 --> 01:26:27.935
Get me out of here!

01:26:30.500 --> 01:26:31.434
Elise!

01:26:31.458 --> 01:26:33.668
Oh, no.

01:26:35.166 --> 01:26:37.976
This place sucks.

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:39.976
Jeff, what are you doing here?

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.476
Elise, you did not
return any of my calls.

01:26:42.500 --> 01:26:44.893
I've nothing to say to you.

01:26:44.917 --> 01:26:46.476
I'm sorry, okay?

01:26:46.500 --> 01:26:48.393
I messed up.
I know that, alright?

01:26:48.417 --> 01:26:50.309
I am so sorry.

01:26:50.333 --> 01:26:53.309
But you cannot --
you have to give me a chance.

01:26:53.333 --> 01:26:56.017
Oh, I don't
have to do anything.

01:26:56.041 --> 01:26:59.017
El,
everything alright?

01:26:59.041 --> 01:27:00.476
Who the hell's this guy?

01:27:00.500 --> 01:27:01.684
This is my boy-

01:27:01.708 --> 01:27:04.810
Aww...

01:27:04.834 --> 01:27:06.393
Eli.

01:27:06.417 --> 01:27:09.747
This is my Eli.

01:27:13.875 --> 01:27:15.017
This guy?

01:27:15.041 --> 01:27:17.461
This --

01:27:18.834 --> 01:27:19.976
Seriously.

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:21.726
Oh....!

01:27:21.750 --> 01:27:24.017
Stop!
Stop!

01:27:24.041 --> 01:27:25.768
Jeff, you are
ruining Visitors Day!

01:27:25.792 --> 01:27:27.017
Stop!

01:27:27.041 --> 01:27:28.643
That's going to leave a mark.

01:27:28.667 --> 01:27:31.684
Jeff, we are done!

01:27:31.708 --> 01:27:33.851
It's over!

01:27:33.875 --> 01:27:37.059
Stop embarrassing
yourself; go home!

01:27:41.792 --> 01:27:43.893
What are you looking at?

01:27:43.917 --> 01:27:46.059
Huh?

01:27:47.792 --> 01:27:49.935
And you...

01:27:54.041 --> 01:27:58.059
that was incredibly hot,
and I am very turned on right now.

01:27:58.083 --> 01:28:01.518
Aww...!

01:28:01.542 --> 01:28:02.726
It's so romantic!

01:28:02.750 --> 01:28:05.768
I love camp so much.

01:28:19.917 --> 01:28:21.476
I should go...

01:28:21.500 --> 01:28:22.059
Yeah, me too.

01:28:22.083 --> 01:28:23.518
...do the...

01:28:23.542 --> 01:28:24.059
thing.

01:28:24.083 --> 01:28:26.726
Yep.

01:28:32.083 --> 01:28:35.768
Sorry, everyone.

01:28:35.792 --> 01:28:41.059
Just dealing with
a ghost from my past!

01:28:44.750 --> 01:28:49.643
Well, that was
quite the closing campfire.

01:28:49.667 --> 01:28:53.059
Thank you to Eli,
for the ghost story.

01:28:57.917 --> 01:29:00.341
What do you say we reconvene
in the morning for a

01:29:00.365 --> 01:29:03.691
delicious breakfast spread
prepared by Allison?

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:09.935
How you doing?

01:29:09.959 --> 01:29:14.629
Might've had a few bowls
of FiberNuts, but I'm holding up.

01:29:16.166 --> 01:29:20.309
Max, I had no idea that Jeff
was going to show up tonight.

01:29:20.333 --> 01:29:22.101
I am so sorry
if this ruined --

01:29:22.125 --> 01:29:24.535
Uh-uh.

01:29:24.667 --> 01:29:27.059
It's fine.

01:29:27.083 --> 01:29:30.434
You know,
we did all we could do.

01:29:30.458 --> 01:29:34.168
And I am really
glad you came back.

01:29:34.834 --> 01:29:36.267
Okay.

01:29:36.291 --> 01:29:37.309
Shall we?

01:29:37.333 --> 01:29:40.633
Well, duh.

01:29:44.083 --> 01:29:47.673
To best friends.

01:29:49.333 --> 01:29:51.684
What about me?

01:29:52.208 --> 01:29:53.518
Alright, get in here.

01:29:53.542 --> 01:29:55.851
Do you have like supersonic hearing
or something?

01:29:55.875 --> 01:29:58.976
I've got some supersonic dishes
I've got to do, so I'll just take one.

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:01.184
Okay.

01:30:01.208 --> 01:30:02.017
Best friends.

01:30:02.041 --> 01:30:05.017
Cheers, guys.

01:30:19.041 --> 01:30:20.184
Max.

01:30:20.208 --> 01:30:21.976
Channing Tatum.

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:24.893
Oh, my God.
You guys overslept.

01:30:24.917 --> 01:30:26.976
And you reek of scotch!

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:28.142
Now, come on.

01:30:28.166 --> 01:30:30.726
Put an Altoid in your mouth
and come help me out.

01:30:30.750 --> 01:30:32.893
The line in the mess is insane.

01:30:32.917 --> 01:30:34.226
What?

01:30:34.250 --> 01:30:37.017
Yes!

01:30:37.041 --> 01:30:38.851
Allison, everything's under control.

01:30:38.875 --> 01:30:40.184
What are you talking about?

01:30:40.208 --> 01:30:41.976
Oh, I'm not talking about this line.

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:43.880
Come on.

01:30:45.708 --> 01:30:49.017
I'm talking about that line.

01:30:51.917 --> 01:30:54.893
Yeah, no one can shut up
about last night's ghost.

01:30:54.917 --> 01:30:58.351
Apparently it reminded campers
and ex-campers aka moms

01:30:58.375 --> 01:31:01.351
with checkbooks how
magical camp can be.

01:31:01.375 --> 01:31:05.226
Plus I think they genuinely
don't want Jared in charge of their children.

01:31:09.417 --> 01:31:10.935
Hey.

01:31:10.959 --> 01:31:11.893
Hey.

01:31:11.917 --> 01:31:12.893
Guess what.

01:31:12.917 --> 01:31:14.267
What?

01:31:14.291 --> 01:31:17.142
We officially did it; over 60 percent
of the camp has preregistered.

01:31:17.166 --> 01:31:18.768
Hey, Chet?

01:31:18.792 --> 01:31:20.976
Guess what?

01:31:23.959 --> 01:31:26.101
Chet, please?

01:31:26.125 --> 01:31:28.245
I don't get it.

01:31:30.792 --> 01:31:32.142
Woodshed.

01:31:32.166 --> 01:31:35.434
Chet, woodshed.

01:31:35.458 --> 01:31:38.976
So like, how old do you have
to be to be a counselor?

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:40.768
Because obvi,
I am super-mature for my age.

01:31:40.792 --> 01:31:43.309
Okay, smoker's cough
doesn't make you mature.

01:31:43.333 --> 01:31:45.393
Give it five more
summers as a camper.

01:31:45.417 --> 01:31:49.309
Okay. Well, can you put all the robin's
eggs in the same cabin next year?

01:31:49.333 --> 01:31:50.810
It's a deal.

01:31:50.834 --> 01:31:53.101
Are you serious?

01:31:53.125 --> 01:31:55.976
Whoa!

01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:56.810
Bye.

01:31:56.834 --> 01:31:58.684
I'll see you next summer, girls.

01:31:58.708 --> 01:32:01.101
You guys, we did it!

01:32:01.375 --> 01:32:03.142
So exciting!

01:32:03.166 --> 01:32:04.142
I know!

01:32:04.166 --> 01:32:06.351
Wow.

01:32:06.375 --> 01:32:07.267
Maxine.

01:32:07.291 --> 01:32:08.643
Hi!

01:32:08.667 --> 01:32:11.309
I hear you are about
to take over the Takota throne.

01:32:11.333 --> 01:32:12.851
The rumors are true-mors,
Ms. Fefferman.

01:32:12.875 --> 01:32:13.810
Call me Kathy.

01:32:13.834 --> 01:32:14.976
And then...

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:16.309
just call me.

01:32:16.333 --> 01:32:17.309
Let's talk sponsorship!

01:32:17.333 --> 01:32:19.393
Okay.

01:32:19.417 --> 01:32:23.059
Elise, I just want to thank you for
everything you did for Penny this summer.

01:32:23.083 --> 01:32:25.142
It was my pleasure.

01:32:25.166 --> 01:32:27.786
Everything?

01:32:30.333 --> 01:32:33.184
Did you get a deal on Avon?

01:32:33.208 --> 01:32:36.434
Kathy Fefferman: President
of Fefferman Sporting Goods.

01:32:36.458 --> 01:32:38.643
I smell an equestrian center.

01:32:38.667 --> 01:32:39.893
Oh, no. That's just me.

01:32:39.917 --> 01:32:41.017
Oh.

01:32:41.041 --> 01:32:42.518
Ooh.

01:32:42.542 --> 01:32:44.559
Guys, is that Lindsay Johnson?

01:32:44.583 --> 01:32:48.393
The "practicing Frenching"
Lindsay Johnson?

01:32:48.417 --> 01:32:50.059
Excuse me, ladies.

01:32:50.083 --> 01:32:53.476
♪ This is my moment. ♪

01:32:53.500 --> 01:32:56.460
I'm going to go help
with preregistrations.

01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:58.184
In the woodshed.

01:32:58.208 --> 01:33:00.893
Ooh.

01:33:25.125 --> 01:33:27.059
Can I get in on this?

01:33:27.083 --> 01:33:28.267
Bring it over, lady.

01:33:28.291 --> 01:33:35.267
So Max, now that you are
officially camp director,

01:33:35.291 --> 01:33:37.893
and there's actually
a camp to direct,

01:33:37.917 --> 01:33:40.684
what is your first order of business?

01:33:40.708 --> 01:33:41.351
Allison?

01:33:41.375 --> 01:33:43.017
Yep?

01:33:43.041 --> 01:33:44.500
You're fired.

01:33:44.525 --> 01:33:46.184
Aww, man!

01:33:46.208 --> 01:33:49.518
Don't worry, girl; we can
be unemployed together!

01:33:49.542 --> 01:33:53.601
Girls, seriously, thank you.

01:33:53.625 --> 01:33:57.393
Like all jokes and sarcasm aside,
thank you.

01:33:57.417 --> 01:34:00.226
I'm pretty lucky to have two
friends that will put up

01:34:00.250 --> 01:34:01.601
with all my crazy ideas.

01:34:01.625 --> 01:34:04.125
You know, like saving a camp.

01:34:05.417 --> 01:34:07.059
I think it was worth saving.

01:34:07.083 --> 01:34:08.226
Yep.

01:34:08.250 --> 01:34:10.059
Agreed.

01:34:10.083 --> 01:34:11.559
Unlike that fanny pack.

01:34:11.583 --> 01:34:12.935
I'm sorry, what was that?

01:34:12.959 --> 01:34:14.935
Okay, I haven't said a single thing

01:34:14.959 --> 01:34:16.476
but that has got to go.

01:34:16.500 --> 01:34:18.059
This is a classic, Elise.

01:34:18.083 --> 01:34:19.476
It makes me class-sick.

01:34:19.500 --> 01:34:20.559
Oo-ooh!

01:34:20.583 --> 01:34:22.101
I did one.

01:34:22.125 --> 01:34:23.309
That was good.

01:34:23.333 --> 01:34:26.559
I'm proud of you for that joke,
but I still don't believe you

01:34:26.583 --> 01:34:28.476
on the fanny pack.

01:34:28.500 --> 01:34:32.226
Yeah, you've really got
to fanny-pack it up.

01:34:51.375 --> 01:34:54.075
Raise that end a little higher?

01:34:58.333 --> 01:35:01.017
It's perfect.

01:35:09.333 --> 01:35:10.643
Thank you very much.

01:35:10.667 --> 01:35:12.267
You're welcome.

01:35:12.291 --> 01:35:13.184

01:35:13.208 --> 01:35:16.393
Eli.

01:35:16.417 --> 01:35:18.851
What are you doing here?

01:35:18.875 --> 01:35:23.017
Well, I think you're really pretty,
and I wanted your autograph, so.

01:35:23.041 --> 01:35:25.476
You know you get these for free.

01:35:25.500 --> 01:35:27.226
Quit holding up my line.

01:35:27.250 --> 01:35:28.101
Alright.

01:35:28.125 --> 01:35:30.017
I'll be at the bar.
