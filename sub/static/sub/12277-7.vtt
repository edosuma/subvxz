WEBVTT

00:01.084 --> 00:03.211
I want to tell you
I love you.

00:03.629 --> 00:04.744
CARTER:
Previously on Eureka...

00:04.922 --> 00:07.334
We could all be inside
some totally advanced
computer construct

00:07.508 --> 00:10.090
that just looks and feels
like the real world,

00:10.260 --> 00:11.215
and we wouldn't
even know it.

00:11.386 --> 00:15.629
Please dispose of
Doctor Marten, respectfully
and securely.

00:16.099 --> 00:18.055
FARGO: You reactivated
the matrix mainframe?

00:18.310 --> 00:19.675
You didn't tell her
what we're doing, did you?

00:19.853 --> 00:21.514
Relax. No one
is going to find out.

00:21.897 --> 00:24.104
The mainframe has been
tracking the Z waves
of the Astraeus crew.

00:24.274 --> 00:27.016
But it found one
that's still active
inside the program.

00:27.194 --> 00:29.435
Holly?
Doug?

00:31.281 --> 00:32.862
What did you see?
I saw her.

00:33.242 --> 00:34.106
ZANE: What?

00:34.284 --> 00:36.866
She's notjust
a damaged
memory file, Zane.

00:37.037 --> 00:38.868
I think Holly is alive.

00:52.177 --> 00:54.168
Is that straight?
lt's straight.

00:54.805 --> 00:56.636
Okay, and what do you
think of the flowers,
too cheerful?

00:56.807 --> 00:57.967
I can always
get calla lilies.

00:58.141 --> 01:00.177
No, I think
Holly would love it.

01:01.687 --> 01:03.268
Are you sure that
that picture is straight?

01:03.814 --> 01:06.556
Jo, everything looks great.

01:07.693 --> 01:09.775
| just know that
today is going to be
really hard on Fargo,

01:09.945 --> 01:12.652
and I want everything
to be perfect.

01:17.369 --> 01:18.154
SOLDIER: Perfect.

01:18.328 --> 01:19.283
Mount the next
node up there.

01:19.454 --> 01:21.115
We can get supplementary
coverage from the
one down the hall.

01:21.290 --> 01:23.281
Excuse me,
what's up with the balls?

01:23.458 --> 01:24.664
Nodes.
Nodes.

01:24.835 --> 01:26.371
You must be
Sheriff Carter.
Yes, hi.

01:26.545 --> 01:28.160
Major William Shaw,
Department of Defense.

01:28.338 --> 01:30.249
I'm with Special
Project Security.

01:31.383 --> 01:32.623
And you are?

01:32.801 --> 01:36.510
Wondering why
you are drilling holes
in my facility, sir?

01:36.680 --> 01:37.544
You're looking well, Lupo.

01:38.140 --> 01:39.129
Hmm.

01:39.308 --> 01:41.390
The sergeant and I
served together
in Afghanistan.

01:43.812 --> 01:45.928
Uh, but what
brings you here?

01:47.316 --> 01:49.022
I'm here
to install PanOp,

01:49.192 --> 01:51.148
G.D.'s new
security system.

01:52.321 --> 01:54.733
I sent Dr. Fargo
numerous memos.

01:55.490 --> 01:56.149
I'll go talkto him.

01:56.325 --> 01:58.987
Uh, you and your team
are welcome to wait outside.

01:59.161 --> 02:00.617
We're on a pretty
tight schedule.

02:00.787 --> 02:05.531
Major, you're not putting
those in here today.

02:08.211 --> 02:09.462
Not today.

02:10.839 --> 02:11.999
My apologies.

02:12.174 --> 02:13.914
We'll start with
the rest of the facility.

02:14.092 --> 02:15.207
Thank you.

02:15.636 --> 02:17.376
All right, gentlemen,
we'll start in Sector Four.

02:17.554 --> 02:19.215
Back up.
Yes, sir.

02:23.268 --> 02:24.474
Fargo...

02:26.521 --> 02:30.514
Wow. Um, you doing okay?

02:30.692 --> 02:32.899
Yeah, just wishing
clip-ons were back in style.

02:33.070 --> 02:35.061
I had an awesome one
in seventh grade.
It had robots.

02:35.238 --> 02:38.401
No, I mean with
today and Holly.

02:39.701 --> 02:42.909
Oh, right, um...
Yeah, well, you know,
I'm managing.

02:43.413 --> 02:45.278
Taking it one day
at a time.

02:46.792 --> 02:48.453
Do you know how long
the ceremony is
going to be?

02:48.627 --> 02:51.585
Because I have got
a ton of work to do.

02:51.755 --> 02:54.462
I'm sure that Henry
will be respectful

02:54.633 --> 02:58.125
of both Holly's memory
and people's time.

03:00.263 --> 03:01.548
Are they ready?
Almost.

03:01.723 --> 03:05.807
Uh, Fargo, Major Shaw
is here about
the PanOp installation.

03:05.977 --> 03:07.808
Oh, whoops.
That was today?

03:07.979 --> 03:10.721
(STAMMERS) l have an
e-memo here somewhere.

03:10.899 --> 03:13.060
You know, don't worry.
I'll take care of it.

03:13.235 --> 03:15.726
Now you just take care
of yourself today.

03:16.613 --> 03:21.027
Awesome.
I mean, thank you.

03:27.541 --> 03:32.331
Today, we honor
a fallen friend
and colleague

03:33.255 --> 03:35.371
by dedicating
to her memory

03:35.549 --> 03:37.289
an important
new addition

03:37.467 --> 03:39.844
to the Global
Dynamics Observatory.

03:41.179 --> 03:44.717
Holly always loved
observing the stars.

03:45.684 --> 03:48.517
And now,
to remember her that way,

03:49.104 --> 03:54.474
I present to you
the Dr. Holly Marten
Sodium Beacon.

04:13.336 --> 04:14.667
What is that?

04:14.838 --> 04:16.749
A mesospheric laser.

04:16.923 --> 04:18.504
It creates
an artificial star

04:18.675 --> 04:20.791
as a guide for
stellar cartography.

04:30.687 --> 04:33.224
So, it's sort
of a big laser pointer thing?

04:35.233 --> 04:40.068
May it also remind us
that those we've lost
are never truly gone.

04:42.115 --> 04:44.652
Douglas, would you
care to say something?

04:45.076 --> 04:47.328
Uh, no, thanks.
I'm good.

04:49.790 --> 04:52.031
Hmm, okay.

04:53.710 --> 04:55.541
Holly loved music,

04:55.712 --> 05:00.706
so we'll conclude
with what was apparently
her favorite song.

05:00.884 --> 05:03.216
WOMAN: (SINGING)
Ooh, car wash

05:05.931 --> 05:07.967
Working at
the car wash, yeah

05:21.279 --> 05:22.780
VINCENT: Watch your back.

05:23.490 --> 05:25.355
We have all
Holly's favorites.

05:25.534 --> 05:26.944
Fusilli with gruyere,

05:27.410 --> 05:30.538
peanut puree and
blackberry preserves
on brioche.

05:31.122 --> 05:32.987
Mac and cheese,
and PB. and J.

05:33.583 --> 05:34.618
Holly would have loved it.

05:34.793 --> 05:38.035
ljust, uh... I can't
believe she's gone.

05:38.547 --> 05:41.880
Yeah, it's been
tough on all of us.

05:43.009 --> 05:44.340
Thanks, Vincent.
Yeah.

05:47.180 --> 05:48.420
(SIGHS)

05:50.308 --> 05:52.640
Nice service.
Thank you.

05:54.688 --> 05:55.552
What's this?

05:55.730 --> 05:59.723
Um, Grace's
Z wave research.

06:01.278 --> 06:03.269
She was on the verge
of a breakthrough.

06:03.446 --> 06:05.186
Nascent neural networking.

06:05.365 --> 06:08.072
Wow. I'll pretend
like I understand
what that means.

06:08.243 --> 06:10.029
Congratulations.
(LAUGHS)

06:10.495 --> 06:11.735
| just thought
I'd pick up
where she left off,

06:11.913 --> 06:15.076
but the test
subject pool
is very small.

06:15.250 --> 06:19.994
It's only the 22 of you
who were in the matrix
that developed Z waves.

06:20.171 --> 06:21.377
Well, if you need help,
I'll volunteer.

06:22.632 --> 06:24.008
You sure?

06:24.885 --> 06:27.627
The experiments
are unorthodox.

06:27.804 --> 06:29.419
Yeah, count me in.

06:29.598 --> 06:31.134
Lab-rat Carter
at your service.

06:33.435 --> 06:35.175
Thank you.
There you go.

06:36.897 --> 06:39.138
I'm worried about Fargo.
What? Why?

06:40.567 --> 06:41.852
He's been
missing meetings

06:42.027 --> 06:44.313
and he's sleeping
in his office.

06:44.487 --> 06:45.897
Today at the ceremony,
it was like

06:46.072 --> 06:47.528
he had someplace
more important to be.

06:48.867 --> 06:50.073
I know the two of you
have been up to something.

06:50.577 --> 06:51.908
It's nothing.

06:52.203 --> 06:53.613
Look, he just lost Holly,

06:53.788 --> 06:56.370
and everything today
is a reminder of her.

06:58.084 --> 06:59.824
I don't blame him
for wanting to bail.

07:00.003 --> 07:01.209
lfl lost you, I...

07:01.379 --> 07:04.166
You'd swear off
other women for
the rest of your days.

07:04.758 --> 07:05.747
Totally.

07:06.343 --> 07:08.675
Miss Lupo,
sorry to interrupt,

07:08.845 --> 07:11.052
but I can't seem
to locate Dr. Fargo.

07:12.265 --> 07:14.927
lwill, uh,
find him for you, sir.

07:15.101 --> 07:16.056
Supeh

07:16.519 --> 07:17.929
We have
a full agenda today.

07:18.104 --> 07:19.605
With the PanOp installation
almost complete,

07:19.773 --> 07:22.560
we need to impound
everything related to
the Astraeus abduction.

07:22.734 --> 07:24.725
Top priority
is a photonic
plasma computer.

07:25.320 --> 07:27.857
Hold on.
The matrix computer?

07:30.533 --> 07:32.660
Wait, you didn't say
anything about me?

07:32.827 --> 07:33.782
What was I
supposed to say?

07:34.329 --> 07:35.569
Hey, guys,
nice memorial and all,

07:35.747 --> 07:37.283
but Holly is still
kind of alive.

07:37.457 --> 07:38.822
You could have
at least acted upset.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.740
Well, plenty of people did.

07:40.919 --> 07:43.285
The planetary
sciences team would
not stop bawling.

07:43.463 --> 07:46.626
Cosmo chemists
are very sensitive,
unlike certain people.

07:46.800 --> 07:48.540
So, what did
you dedicate?

07:48.969 --> 07:51.836
Only an awesome
sodium beacon for
the observatory.

07:52.222 --> 07:53.678
You named
a laser pointer after me?

07:53.848 --> 07:55.224
It's for astro-imaging.

07:55.392 --> 07:57.883
It's lame. Why didn't
you ask me what I wanted?

07:58.061 --> 07:59.471
What? But I didn't think
you would care.

07:59.646 --> 08:00.726
You're not even
really gone...

08:01.773 --> 08:03.809
Did you shut down
the program
with me inside?

08:03.984 --> 08:04.894
Are you crazy?

08:05.068 --> 08:06.683
Pull yourself together, man,
we have company.

08:08.488 --> 08:10.729
Fargo, what are
you doing here?

08:11.783 --> 08:12.738
Uh, this lab
is restricted,

08:12.909 --> 08:15.241
so thank you
for unlocking it,
Dr. Fargo.

08:15.412 --> 08:16.777
You are welcome.

08:17.872 --> 08:19.703
Major Shaw. Pleasure
to meet you, Director.

08:19.874 --> 08:21.614
Mind if we start with
the main processor?

08:21.793 --> 08:23.374
Yes, I mind.
What are you doing?

08:23.545 --> 08:25.001
We're shipping
this machine
to Washington.

08:25.171 --> 08:26.957
No, you're not.
You're not taking
this computer.

08:27.132 --> 08:28.997
This computer
is a security liability,

08:29.175 --> 08:31.427
as is everything
your colleagues built
during their abduction.

08:31.594 --> 08:33.755
It has to be
locked up for good.

08:34.305 --> 08:36.170
Take anything
you want, except this.

08:36.349 --> 08:37.680
This machine
has done nothing

08:37.851 --> 08:39.591
but put you
and your people
at risk, Dr. Fargo.

08:39.769 --> 08:41.020
Back off, jackboots.

08:41.187 --> 08:43.519
If anyone is going to
take this machine apart,
it's going to be me.

08:43.690 --> 08:45.772
Yeah, what
the frak, Zane?

08:46.276 --> 08:48.232
Fargo, calm down.

08:49.112 --> 08:51.603
I understand this is
an emotional day
for you, Dr. Fargo.

08:51.781 --> 08:53.112
Why don't you just
let us handle this?

08:53.283 --> 08:55.615
I'm not going anywhere.
Jo, help me.

08:55.994 --> 09:00.488
Um, excuse us.
Fargo, come on.

09:02.959 --> 09:04.699
Let's go for a walk.

09:06.755 --> 09:07.961
What is going on
with you?

09:08.131 --> 09:09.496
You can't let them
take it, please.

09:09.674 --> 09:10.663
Why not?

09:10.842 --> 09:12.878
Because Holly
is still in there.

09:17.724 --> 09:19.931
I'm not crazy,
just ask Zane.

09:20.101 --> 09:21.432
Oh, is that
what you've been
working on together?

09:21.603 --> 09:22.683
We were trying
to get her out.

09:22.854 --> 09:24.390
Ijust need
to call the DOD.

09:24.564 --> 09:26.145
Get her out of where?

09:26.316 --> 09:28.773
Fargo, Holly is gone.

09:28.943 --> 09:32.026
No, she isn't.
She exists in the
photonic hard drive.

09:32.197 --> 09:34.688
She's conscious.
I'm not going to
let them take her.

09:34.866 --> 09:35.821
ALLISON: Okay,
you had quite a jolt

09:35.992 --> 09:38.574
to your
somatosensory pathways
when Zane disconnected you.

09:38.745 --> 09:40.235
We just need
to check you out,

09:40.413 --> 09:42.449
and then we can call
Washington together.

09:42.624 --> 09:43.864
Sorry, excuse me.

09:44.042 --> 09:46.249
Um, call them about what?

09:46.669 --> 09:47.829
About keeping
that computer here

09:48.004 --> 09:49.585
until we can figure out
what's going on.

09:49.756 --> 09:52.793
Allison, I don't think
that this is healthy.
Look at him.

09:52.967 --> 09:55.128
Maybe packing
that thing up will
help him move on.

09:55.303 --> 09:56.759
Or maybe he's right.

09:56.930 --> 09:58.670
Maybe some part
of Holly is
still in there.

09:58.848 --> 10:01.555
Yeah, but as what?
A video game?

10:01.726 --> 10:04.809
No. When I saw Jenna
in the other Eureka,

10:04.979 --> 10:06.560
she was as real
as you are.

10:06.731 --> 10:08.892
Everything in there
feels real.

10:09.067 --> 10:10.728
Yeah, but now
you know it wasn't.

10:10.902 --> 10:12.563
Maybe not.

10:12.737 --> 10:15.444
Listen, Jo,
you weren't there.
You can't understand.

10:15.615 --> 10:17.446
But he wants our help.

10:24.415 --> 10:25.916
You still up for this?
Yep. All good.

10:26.084 --> 10:27.039
Good, okay.

10:27.210 --> 10:31.749
Grace documented
the effect of zeta waves
on the iFire nanobots.

10:31.923 --> 10:35.586
I believe that if
we can learn to focus
and control Z waves,

10:35.760 --> 10:38.172
then we can unlock
whole new frontiers,

10:38.346 --> 10:41.338
telepathy,
telekinesis, who knows?

10:41.516 --> 10:42.722
And you think
I can do this?

10:42.892 --> 10:45.224
Well, we are
about to find out.

10:45.395 --> 10:48.228
Relax, focus, try to
levitate the spheres.

10:48.773 --> 10:50.183
Levitate?

10:50.358 --> 10:52.974
Try to levitate
the spheres
in these tubes.

10:53.153 --> 10:55.064
Just concentrate.

10:56.239 --> 10:57.319
All right.

11:15.175 --> 11:16.210
I'm moving your balls
with my mind.

11:16.384 --> 11:18.045
There must be a better way
to say that, but yes.

11:18.219 --> 11:19.334
Just don't get too excited.

11:19.512 --> 11:20.752
(LAUGHING)

11:23.141 --> 11:27.384
Oh! I was still
calibrating the sensors.

11:27.562 --> 11:28.426
Yeah...

11:28.605 --> 11:31.062
Now that test
responds to alpha waves,

11:31.232 --> 11:32.813
which we all have.

11:32.984 --> 11:34.645
Being used right now
for artificial limbs

11:35.111 --> 11:37.022
or computer
interactive devices.

11:37.197 --> 11:38.312
Oh.

11:38.698 --> 11:43.192
This test
is for zeta waves.
Zeta waves.

11:43.912 --> 11:46.995
Control your zeta waves
and you control the gun.

11:47.165 --> 11:48.371
Gun?

11:50.460 --> 11:51.666
(STAMMERING) Shouldn't I
be on the other side?

11:51.836 --> 11:53.952
Well, I think
you'll focus better

11:54.130 --> 11:55.586
if you're on the
business end of things.

11:56.174 --> 11:58.415
Says the guy behind
the protective shield.

11:58.593 --> 11:59.924
Mmm-hmm.

12:02.222 --> 12:03.587
(GROANS) Okay.

12:05.391 --> 12:07.848
Come on, Jack,
make the paintballs miss!

12:08.019 --> 12:10.726
Concentrate.
Your zeta waves
are spiking.

12:11.189 --> 12:11.848
Almost there.
(GROANING)

12:12.023 --> 12:13.138
You can do it.

12:13.316 --> 12:15.056
(CONTINUES GROANING)

12:17.153 --> 12:18.654
Dr. Deacon,
Sheriff Carter.

12:21.074 --> 12:22.735
Bad timing?
Uh, no.

12:22.909 --> 12:25.025
We were just, um,
finishing up with something.

12:25.203 --> 12:26.943
l have a list of items
from my inventory

12:27.121 --> 12:28.622
l was hoping
you could track down.

12:28.790 --> 12:30.906
Oh, we'll get
right on that.

12:31.084 --> 12:33.370
Maybe I could
find it with my mind.

12:34.337 --> 12:35.702
SHAW: How would you do that?
Just kidding.

12:35.880 --> 12:36.960
Uh, listen,
we'll let you know

12:37.131 --> 12:38.667
as soon as we find
your projects, Major.

12:38.841 --> 12:40.092
Supeh

12:43.805 --> 12:45.591
I'm very angry with you.

12:47.934 --> 12:50.971
Zane, you rebuilt
a dangerous piece
of technology

12:51.145 --> 12:53.181
so Fargo could have
a cyber-girlfriend?

12:53.356 --> 12:55.062
No. We still don't know
exactly what Holly is

12:55.233 --> 12:57.315
and we didn't
want to get anyone in
trouble with the DOD.

12:57.485 --> 12:58.645
while we tried
to figure it out.

12:59.195 --> 13:00.810
Okay, listen,
if you and l
are going to work,

13:00.989 --> 13:02.525
you have to be
honest with me, okay?

13:02.699 --> 13:05.441
Not just when
you feel like it,
all the time.

13:05.618 --> 13:07.233
Honest, gotcha.

13:07.412 --> 13:09.277
Now, honestly, babe,
I'm a little busy here.

13:09.455 --> 13:12.788
Okay, Zane, I...
I'm trying
to save Holly, okay?

13:14.460 --> 13:15.836
SHAW: Sorry to interrupt.

13:16.254 --> 13:17.790
Time to box that
bad boy up, Mr. Donovan.

13:17.964 --> 13:19.955
Yeah, it's all yours,
GI. Joe.

13:22.093 --> 13:23.208
And those little
frown lines you get

13:23.386 --> 13:24.375
between your eyes
when you're mad,

13:24.554 --> 13:26.761
they're adorable. Honest.

13:28.641 --> 13:29.847
Later.

13:33.396 --> 13:34.260
You on such
friendly terms

13:34.439 --> 13:35.428
with all the
scientists around here?

13:35.606 --> 13:38.564
Oh, I'm barely
on friendly terms
with that one.

13:38.735 --> 13:41.898
So, um, how does this
PanOp system work exactly?

13:42.363 --> 13:44.228
The nodes provide network,
all-in-one security

13:44.407 --> 13:46.819
wired directly
to G.D.'s main
computer system

13:46.993 --> 13:48.858
and links to
the DOD. in Washington.

13:49.037 --> 13:51.870
Cameras, sensors,
data input and output.

13:52.040 --> 13:52.870
They don't miss a trick.

13:53.041 --> 13:55.123
I'm surprised that
Fargo's okay with these.

13:55.293 --> 13:57.204
In virtual Eureka,
they had a lot
of stuff like this

13:57.378 --> 13:58.242
and it wasn't good.

13:58.880 --> 14:01.622
PanOp might have
saved your friends from
that whole experience.

14:01.799 --> 14:03.175
Wouldn't the Director
do anything
to prevent the loss

14:03.343 --> 14:04.503
of someone
like Dr. Marten?

14:05.636 --> 14:06.591
You have no idea.

14:07.263 --> 14:10.847
What? Is Homeland Security
too busy groping people
to make a phone call?

14:11.017 --> 14:12.473
Hello? Hello?

14:13.269 --> 14:15.225
Well, they were no help,
and now I'll probably
get strip-searched

14:15.396 --> 14:16.772
on every flight for
the rest of my life.

14:16.939 --> 14:17.849
No luck with
DARPA either,

14:18.024 --> 14:20.310
but we still have
other avenues to pursue.

14:20.485 --> 14:23.568
Don't give up hope.
Thanks, Allison,
you're a good friend.

14:24.447 --> 14:26.108
You really think
Holly's in there?

14:26.991 --> 14:28.322
I know she is.

14:28.868 --> 14:29.732
ZANE: Hey, Fargo.

14:29.911 --> 14:31.447
Allison, will you
tell the traitor

14:31.621 --> 14:33.202
that I don't want
to talk to him.

14:33.373 --> 14:34.488
Will you
shut up and listen?

14:34.665 --> 14:35.996
I only volunteered
to break down the machine

14:36.167 --> 14:38.249
so we could
get Holly out.
What?

14:39.003 --> 14:40.118
How?

14:41.214 --> 14:42.704
I built a partition
on the G.D. mainframe

14:42.882 --> 14:45.168
and transferred
a character file into it.

14:46.219 --> 14:50.428
Is that even possible?
I mean, she's notjust
a spreadsheet. And...thanks.

14:51.724 --> 14:53.385
Yeah, well, I had to try.

14:57.939 --> 15:00.851
Damn it,
the partition is empty.

15:01.025 --> 15:01.650
What?

15:01.818 --> 15:03.774
Holly must still be on
the photonic hard drive.

15:03.945 --> 15:05.731
And now Shaw has it.

15:06.239 --> 15:08.696
HENRY: The next item
on the DOD. impound list

15:08.866 --> 15:12.199
is a frictionless
graphene servo.

15:12.370 --> 15:16.033
CARTER:
Right... Which is servo?

15:16.749 --> 15:19.331
Clearly something
I've never seen before.

15:19.502 --> 15:21.834
Hey, what happened
earlier with, um, Shaw?

15:22.380 --> 15:24.587
Shaw is collecting
special projects.

15:25.258 --> 15:27.374
The Z waves
the 22 of you developed

15:27.552 --> 15:30.134
make you
a special project.

15:30.304 --> 15:32.044
And spending
a day as a lab rat...

15:32.223 --> 15:34.555
Yeah, it's better than
spending a lifetime
as one, but come on,

15:34.725 --> 15:36.511
I couldn't move squat.

15:36.686 --> 15:40.770
It's not like
I wave my hand and...
Things happen.

15:42.900 --> 15:44.356
Except that.

15:44.944 --> 15:46.229
(LAUGHS)

15:50.116 --> 15:51.322
Are you seeing this?

15:53.786 --> 15:54.650
Oh, yeah.

15:56.831 --> 15:57.946
Oh.

15:59.250 --> 16:00.535
(ALARM RINGING)

16:03.963 --> 16:04.998
Not responding.

16:14.682 --> 16:15.888
What was that?

16:18.186 --> 16:19.767
Special project, huh?

16:23.608 --> 16:26.691
I have no mechanical
or mathematical reason
for that malfunction.

16:26.861 --> 16:28.317
It had to be you.

16:28.488 --> 16:31.400
Oh, what,
so I got superpowers now?

16:31.574 --> 16:35.362
Not so loud. We don't
want to bring any
premature attention to it.

16:37.914 --> 16:38.778
So this is broken.

16:38.956 --> 16:41.117
I'll go... I'll go...
The poison gas.

16:41.292 --> 16:42.327
Right. Oh, and
I'll run some tests.

16:42.502 --> 16:45.369
Oh, and (WHISPERING)
you might want to keep
your hands in your pockets.

16:45.546 --> 16:47.878
Good safety tip.
Yeah.

16:49.258 --> 16:51.044
I feel safer.
That's good.

16:55.598 --> 16:58.214
Last time
we saw each other,
we had a fight.

16:58.893 --> 17:02.385
Fargo, all couples argue,
even virtual ones.

17:02.563 --> 17:04.064
No, she's real!

17:05.900 --> 17:08.107
I don't think
I realized
how real until now.

17:08.277 --> 17:10.529
Maybe we should just
tell Shaw about Holly.

17:10.696 --> 17:13.153
They're going to find out
about her anyway when
they examine the computer.

17:13.324 --> 17:14.780
You know
what they'll do
if I tell them.

17:14.951 --> 17:17.909
They'll study her.
They'll try to
figure out what she is.

17:18.079 --> 17:19.660
They'll dissect her.

17:19.830 --> 17:20.990
If I don't tell them,

17:21.165 --> 17:23.156
maybe they'll think
she's an MPG
and leave her alone.

17:23.334 --> 17:27.202
I could stand
never seeing her again
if I knew she was safe.

17:32.718 --> 17:33.878
The DOD. has
got our machine

17:34.053 --> 17:35.884
in a secure
loading bay
in Section Four.

17:36.055 --> 17:37.886
They're going to
wipe the hard drive
before they ship it out.

17:38.057 --> 17:39.217
They're going
to erase Holly?

17:39.392 --> 17:40.131
We can't
let that happen.

17:40.685 --> 17:42.391
Do you know a way
past the DOD. guards

17:42.562 --> 17:44.052
on our shiny
new security system?

17:44.230 --> 17:49.816
Oh, well, you didn't
hear it from me,
but there may be a way.

17:55.908 --> 17:58.991
ALLISON ON RADIO:
You should see a junction
a few meters ahead of you.

18:03.791 --> 18:05.622
I'm nearing the junction.

18:07.503 --> 18:10.415
The PanOp system
is ready to go online, sir.

18:10.840 --> 18:12.831
Sorry, habit.

18:14.135 --> 18:15.500
Now you have people
calling you "sir."

18:15.678 --> 18:17.589
They wouldn't dare.

18:17.763 --> 18:19.628
You know what I mean.

18:19.974 --> 18:23.137
Leadership suits you, Jo.
I always thought it would.

18:25.438 --> 18:27.929
You miss it?
Special Forces?

18:29.066 --> 18:31.682
Oh, this place
is plenty special.

18:33.195 --> 18:35.527
Long as it hasn't
dulled your edge.

18:35.698 --> 18:37.438
Like writing memos?

18:40.494 --> 18:43.486
You and Dr. Fargo
will be able to minder
all the notes from here.

18:43.664 --> 18:44.574
So will the DOD.

18:44.749 --> 18:47.616
Still seems kind of
Big Brother for G.D.

18:48.127 --> 18:50.038
Did you hear about
the dark matter
pair annihilation

18:50.212 --> 18:52.498
that took out Area 51?
No.

18:52.882 --> 18:56.420
Exactly. Didn't happen,
thanks to PanOp.

18:56.969 --> 19:00.587
This isn't about
spying, this is about
protecting people.

19:09.190 --> 19:12.523
Wow, that is impressive.

19:13.110 --> 19:15.226
You can see, hear,
and detect intrusions,

19:15.404 --> 19:17.486
both physical and digital.

19:19.700 --> 19:22.077
Is that
supposed to happen?
No.

19:22.912 --> 19:25.198
What's the problem?
I don't know.

19:31.087 --> 19:32.543
What the hell is that?

19:34.548 --> 19:36.049
Hit the reset switch.

19:41.597 --> 19:43.633
I'm guessing that isn't
supposed to happen either.

19:50.231 --> 19:51.812
What happened?
Wasn't me.

19:51.982 --> 19:53.392
Something scrambled PanOp.

19:54.568 --> 19:55.853
Whatever it was
saved me a nasty hack,

19:56.028 --> 19:57.564
but the system will
reset in a few minutes.

19:57.738 --> 19:58.853
ALLISON: Fargo,
PanOp is down now,

19:59.031 --> 20:00.237
but we don't know
for how long.

20:00.408 --> 20:01.864
Zane will buy you
as much time as he can.

20:02.034 --> 20:03.410
Affirmative.

20:05.830 --> 20:07.036
Frodo has reached Mordor.

20:07.206 --> 20:10.039
Repeat. Frodo
has reached Mordor.

20:10.209 --> 20:11.995
Fargo, you have to hurry.

20:12.169 --> 20:15.252
FARGO: Access panel stuck,
almost got it.

20:16.257 --> 20:18.498
How do you know about
secret passageways
around G.D. anyway?

20:18.676 --> 20:22.168
You and Carter been
playing security guard
and sexy cat burglar?

20:22.346 --> 20:24.553
My lips are sealed.
Oh, thank you.

20:25.641 --> 20:27.632
Jo put the two of us
on mutual full disclosure.

20:27.810 --> 20:29.141
Oh, how's that
working for you?

20:29.311 --> 20:31.848
Mmm. Some things
people are better off
not knowing.

20:32.022 --> 20:32.772
(GRUNTS) Got it.

20:47.455 --> 20:48.615
(GRUNTING)

20:51.959 --> 20:53.244
I'm in. (GROANS)

20:58.174 --> 20:59.755
(WHISPERING) Precious...

21:01.177 --> 21:03.259
Where are you,
my precious?

21:03.971 --> 21:05.677
(INDISTINCT WHISPERING)

21:07.266 --> 21:08.426
Hello?

21:09.268 --> 21:10.178
ls someone there?

21:13.355 --> 21:14.265
ALLISON:
Fargo, what's happening?

21:14.440 --> 21:16.681
Um, hearing things,
lguess?

21:18.819 --> 21:20.480
It's kind of
creepy in here.

21:22.823 --> 21:24.609
(YELPING)

21:30.998 --> 21:33.239
(PANTING)

21:35.336 --> 21:36.997
Now it's dark and creepy.

21:37.505 --> 21:40.292
ZANE: What are you
talking about? Get moving.

21:45.179 --> 21:46.760
Oh, found it.

21:49.183 --> 21:50.719
Okay, the drive has
an onboard power cell,

21:50.893 --> 21:51.723
plug it in and
you're good to go.

21:51.894 --> 21:54.476
Port six. Green light
means you got her.

21:55.231 --> 21:56.471
Gotcha.

22:10.204 --> 22:12.160
Are you sure
the flash drive will work?

22:12.331 --> 22:14.788
I don't know.
We haven't fully decoded
Holly's data structure.

22:15.835 --> 22:17.371
I don't understand.

22:17.545 --> 22:19.661
We've never had
a system failure
like this before.

22:19.839 --> 22:21.795
There. We're back up.

22:23.717 --> 22:25.048
Who's that?

22:27.304 --> 22:28.259
Fargo.

22:33.727 --> 22:36.343
Son of a...
PanOp is back online.
Tick-tock, Frodo.

22:38.816 --> 22:42.354
Nothing's happening.
I'm going in.

22:44.405 --> 22:46.270
No, no, Fargo.
No, you don't have time.

22:49.577 --> 22:50.566
Holly?

22:53.622 --> 22:54.828
Holly?

22:59.211 --> 23:00.951
Holly!

23:06.051 --> 23:08.918
SHAW: Dr. Fargo,
what are you doing here?

23:10.890 --> 23:12.755
You already
wiped the machine.

23:13.934 --> 23:15.674
I'm sorry, Dr. Fargo.

23:15.853 --> 23:18.936
Miss Lupo, would you
please place him
under arrest.

23:32.036 --> 23:34.368
Jo, you arrested Fargo?

23:34.538 --> 23:35.527
I thought
Allison was kidding.

23:35.706 --> 23:36.695
Did she tell you
what he's been doing?

23:36.874 --> 23:38.489
Yes, and I even
understood some of it.

23:38.667 --> 23:40.043
Look, we've got to fix this.

23:40.210 --> 23:41.541
Can you talk to Shaw,
maybe get Zane to do

23:41.712 --> 23:42.792
like a computer
autopsy or something?

23:42.963 --> 23:44.373
Oh, not you, too.

23:44.548 --> 23:48.132
Jo, I live in
a robot house
with a robot deputy.

23:48.594 --> 23:50.960
I think we should find out
what this Holly thing is
before we just dismiss it.

23:51.138 --> 23:52.344
I'm going to be
a little busy figuring out

23:52.514 --> 23:54.766
how to keep Shaw from
pursuing formal charges

23:54.934 --> 23:57.721
or getting us all fired,
starting with Fargo.

23:57.895 --> 23:58.930
Come on, fired?

23:59.104 --> 24:02.267
Come on nothing, okay?
He broke into
an off-limits area

24:02.441 --> 24:04.523
and tampered with
a brand-new security system

24:04.944 --> 24:06.104
in front of the DOD.

24:06.278 --> 24:07.734
FARGO: I didn't tamper.

24:07.905 --> 24:09.395
That weird whispering
and those lights...

24:09.573 --> 24:11.279
It wasn't me either.

24:11.784 --> 24:12.739
What does he mean?

24:12.910 --> 24:15.902
Um, I don't know.
We've been getting strange
incident reports all day.

24:16.080 --> 24:17.911
Doors opening and
closing on their own,

24:18.082 --> 24:20.744
machines malfunctioning,
noises.

24:22.503 --> 24:24.494
All over G.D.?

24:25.047 --> 24:27.914
So notjust where I am?

24:29.093 --> 24:30.629
No, Carter,
not just where you are.

24:31.303 --> 24:32.418
How disappointing.

24:32.596 --> 24:35.759
Um, okay, well,
uh, things started
to go haywire

24:35.933 --> 24:37.798
right when Shaw installed
those security things.

24:37.977 --> 24:39.763
Maybe they're doing it.

24:40.354 --> 24:44.347
Okay, lwill look into it,
but he isn't going anywhere.

24:46.151 --> 24:49.643
You want to help Fargo,
finish Shaw's inventory.

24:49.822 --> 24:50.982
(SIGHS)

24:51.657 --> 24:52.646
Yeah.

24:53.993 --> 24:55.904
Jo, listen, about Fargo.

24:56.078 --> 24:57.864
I told you that machine
was bad for him.

24:58.038 --> 24:59.494
And locking him up isn't?

24:59.665 --> 25:00.700
Hey, do you know
how much trouble he's in?

25:00.874 --> 25:02.614
How many protocols
he's violated?

25:02.793 --> 25:06.502
He believes that,
that computer is
his chance to save Holly.

25:07.339 --> 25:08.840
You helped him break in.

25:09.258 --> 25:11.749
Allison, they recovered
Holly's body.

25:12.219 --> 25:15.131
She's gone, and
it's only hurting Fargo
to act like she's not.

25:15.305 --> 25:17.682
We both want
what's best for Fargo.

25:17.850 --> 25:20.683
Well, then maybe
we should
help him let her go.

25:25.816 --> 25:29.024
Ow. So, how's Fargo?

25:29.695 --> 25:30.775
He's all right.

25:30.946 --> 25:33.278
I didn't realize
the lengths he'd go
to keep Holly around.

25:33.449 --> 25:35.485
The computer
preserved her identity

25:35.659 --> 25:38.321
and her consciousness
complete with opinions,

25:38.495 --> 25:39.905
memories, emotions.

25:40.080 --> 25:41.991
I mean, I understand
wanting to protect that.

25:42.166 --> 25:44.077
I mean, you hold on
to what you can, Jack.

25:45.878 --> 25:47.664
Like Grace's research?

25:47.838 --> 25:50.170
Yeah, I mean,
if we can establish
some common ground,

25:50.340 --> 25:52.831
then we can start
to build from there.

25:55.512 --> 25:57.468
Collimating Q-switch.
Right. Gesundheit.

25:57.639 --> 26:01.348
Um, actually,
speaking about
your lab tests,

26:01.518 --> 26:04.555
uh, it turns out
that things have been
creepy all over G.D.

26:04.730 --> 26:07.847
So it's probably not
me and my zeta waves.
(LAUGHING)

26:08.025 --> 26:10.983
Though I am thinking
it's the, urn,
spy-ball things.

26:11.653 --> 26:13.484
The PanOp nodes?
Yeah.

26:13.655 --> 26:15.236
Mmm.
Mmm.

26:15.407 --> 26:17.272
But, Jack...

26:20.412 --> 26:22.277
Henry,
I don't see any nodes.

26:22.456 --> 26:24.822
There, uh...
There's not one in here.

26:25.000 --> 26:26.285
Uh-huh.

26:38.722 --> 26:39.928
Go, go, go, go.

26:47.523 --> 26:48.763
(BOTH SCREAMING)

26:59.243 --> 27:01.199
Henry...
I didn't touch anything.

27:01.370 --> 27:02.780
Oh.

27:08.752 --> 27:10.663
These don't look random.

27:17.094 --> 27:19.085
Maybe we are being haunted.

27:23.517 --> 27:25.132
You want to give me
some space, Chief?

27:25.310 --> 27:26.425
With a record like yours,
I shouldn't even be

27:26.603 --> 27:28.184
letting you
touch this machine.

27:28.355 --> 27:29.561
I was pardoned.

27:29.731 --> 27:30.937
You're a felon.

27:31.108 --> 27:33.975
Well, guess we're not
going out for beers.

27:36.530 --> 27:37.736
Any sign of intrusion?

27:37.906 --> 27:39.771
Besides him, no.

27:40.200 --> 27:41.440
But I did find
this weird bit stream

27:41.618 --> 27:43.904
rattling around
in the mainframe.
Where?

27:44.079 --> 27:46.616
It's all over.
It's like a ghost.

27:46.790 --> 27:49.748
It disappears from
one subsystem, and then
it pops up in another.

27:49.918 --> 27:51.374
That's the problem
right there.

27:54.923 --> 27:56.208
I'm deploying
a level-six antivirus

27:56.383 --> 27:57.998
to purge
the G.D. system.

27:58.177 --> 28:01.089
Whatever your ghost is,
PanOp will kill it.

28:04.975 --> 28:08.217
AUTOMATED VOICE: System purge
will commence in 30 minutes.

28:09.438 --> 28:10.644
Well, he's fun.

28:10.814 --> 28:11.724
You helped
Allison and Fargo

28:11.899 --> 28:13.355
break into the
loading bay, didn't you?

28:14.651 --> 28:15.481
If you want me
to be honest,

28:15.652 --> 28:18.189
don't ask questions
you don't want
the answers to.

28:18.363 --> 28:20.274
Fargo is
so deep in denial,
it's contagious.

28:20.824 --> 28:22.815
It may be some sort of
partial computer program,

28:22.993 --> 28:25.655
but Allison thinks that
it's an emotional projection,

28:25.829 --> 28:27.069
and Carter has no clue,

28:27.247 --> 28:29.624
and you can't
possibly believe that
that's really Holly.

28:29.791 --> 28:33.830
Jo, it doesn't matter
what any of us think,
just Fargo.

28:34.129 --> 28:35.039
Yeah, but I just want...

28:35.214 --> 28:37.455
I don't know
why you're so hung up
on defining what she is.

28:37.633 --> 28:38.292
Because I've been...

28:38.467 --> 28:43.211
Jo, you might think
you're helping Fargo,
but you're not.

28:53.482 --> 28:55.347
What next, water-boarding?

28:56.902 --> 28:58.767
Let's go talk to Shaw.

28:59.238 --> 29:00.398
About?

29:03.867 --> 29:08.156
I watched my dad struggle
after my mom died.

29:08.914 --> 29:11.951
You know he held it together
for my brothers and me,

29:13.085 --> 29:14.700
but every night
I watched him go through

29:14.878 --> 29:17.369
old photos and home movies,

29:17.547 --> 29:21.756
and he just
couldn't let her go.

29:27.933 --> 29:29.719
I am sorry, Fargo.

29:29.893 --> 29:32.009
I thought
I was helping you.

29:33.438 --> 29:34.723
I know.

29:35.357 --> 29:38.224
I guess I didn't
really didn't make it
that easy on you, did I?

29:40.988 --> 29:44.606
Hey, it's, um...
It's a nice cell.
It's very tidy.

29:44.783 --> 29:45.898
(LAUGHING)

29:46.076 --> 29:47.111
Working at the car wash

29:48.954 --> 29:52.242
What is that music?
I hate this song.

29:52.416 --> 29:53.701
Who doesn't?

29:57.337 --> 29:58.838
Wait, what did
you just say?

29:59.006 --> 30:00.041
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

30:00.215 --> 30:02.456
Lupo. Yeah,
he's right here.

30:04.094 --> 30:06.085
We're on our way.
Come on.

30:06.847 --> 30:07.802
Jo, wait.

30:08.473 --> 30:10.088
Is that possible?
I mean, all the weirdness,

30:10.267 --> 30:11.347
the waving,
the whispering,

30:11.518 --> 30:12.633
that's someone trying
to communicate with us?

30:12.811 --> 30:14.096
Crudely at first, but yeah.

30:14.271 --> 30:16.227
I think
they got the hang of it.

30:16.398 --> 30:17.934
Yeah, see,
just as I thought.

30:18.108 --> 30:20.349
A Z wave signature,
and notjust anyone's.

30:20.527 --> 30:23.439
We think we know
what's going on.
Yeah, us, too.

30:27.659 --> 30:28.739
That's Holly's handwriting.

30:31.371 --> 30:33.077
I told you
she's alive!

30:38.378 --> 30:40.084
CARTER:
So Zane's upload worked?
HENRY: It must have.

30:40.255 --> 30:41.540
Holly didn't stay
in the partition

30:41.715 --> 30:43.296
because she's not
a computer program.

30:43.467 --> 30:45.799
She has a mind
of her own.
She's alive.

30:45.969 --> 30:49.553
AUTOMATED VOICE:
System purge will commence
in three minutes.

30:49.723 --> 30:50.929
For three minutes,
anyway.

30:57.856 --> 31:00.723
AUTOMATED VOICE: PanOp
system purge has commenced.

31:04.321 --> 31:05.436
I can't stop the purge,

31:07.282 --> 31:08.522
but I can
track it from here

31:08.700 --> 31:10.611
as it moves through
the PanOp nodes.

31:10.786 --> 31:11.491
When one of
those turns red,

31:11.661 --> 31:14.152
that means the area
has been purged.

31:14.331 --> 31:16.037
If the purge catches Holly,
she's gone for good.

31:16.208 --> 31:18.073
Well, what can we do?
We find Holly.

31:18.251 --> 31:20.458
If we can locate
her signal, Zane can hack
an escape route for her.

31:21.338 --> 31:23.750
The last sighting
was in Section Three.

31:24.508 --> 31:25.497
The isotope centrifuge
went bananas.

31:25.675 --> 31:28.257
Well, we just need to
stay one step ahead of
the purge and Shaw.

31:28.428 --> 31:30.089
All right. I'm on it.

31:30.263 --> 31:33.471
I gotta tell you,
| sort of like
"Bad Allison."

31:33.642 --> 31:35.303
Let's go. I'll go look
for signs of Holly.

31:35.477 --> 31:37.513
Jo, we got to buy
Holly some time.

31:41.650 --> 31:44.266
Jo, you mind telling me
why you released Dr. Fargo?

31:44.444 --> 31:45.684
You have
to stop the purge.

31:45.862 --> 31:48.854
It's affecting
delicate systems.

31:49.032 --> 31:51.694
A level-six antivirus
kills malware, nothing else.

31:51.868 --> 31:52.948
I'm trying to protect G.D.

31:53.120 --> 31:55.281
I am the head of security.
I know how to protect G.D.

31:55.455 --> 31:56.661
Now stop the purge.

31:56.832 --> 31:58.948
Holly's signal is
both neural and digital.

31:59.126 --> 32:00.741
Oh, so she can survive
in the G.D. system

32:00.919 --> 32:02.625
because it supports
all kind of computing,

32:02.796 --> 32:04.457
digital, optical, organic.

32:04.631 --> 32:06.087
So, if we can
download Holly

32:06.258 --> 32:07.213
before the purge
wipes her out,

32:07.384 --> 32:09.466
I think we can build
a memory lattice
to hold her.

32:10.095 --> 32:11.301
If we could
just find her.

32:13.181 --> 32:14.170
Is that you, Holly?

32:15.851 --> 32:16.715
That's my girl.

32:18.770 --> 32:20.055
Node just went red.

32:20.230 --> 32:23.017
Zane, Holly needs
to get out of here, now.

32:24.401 --> 32:26.312
ZANE: Allison,
I'm hacking a path to
send Holly your way.

32:26.945 --> 32:28.230
Zane, now.

32:28.405 --> 32:30.145
Sorry, Holly's
packing a lot of power.

32:30.323 --> 32:31.403
Not every system
can handle her.

32:31.575 --> 32:32.530
Now, Zane!

32:33.952 --> 32:34.816
That's it.

32:36.913 --> 32:37.902
HENRY: Just in time.

32:39.166 --> 32:40.246
I've got her.

32:40.417 --> 32:42.499
Holly's in the
Corrosive Compounds Lab.
Is she safe?

32:42.669 --> 32:43.909
Go by the nodes.

32:49.885 --> 32:50.840
The purge is coming.

32:51.428 --> 32:53.589
It's too fast.
We can't stay ahead of it.

32:53.763 --> 32:55.424
Henry needs more time
to build the memory lattice.

32:55.599 --> 32:57.180
Well, we need
to find a place where
there are no nodes.

32:57.350 --> 32:58.510
Well, Shaw
put them everywhere.

32:58.685 --> 33:00.266
They're all over G.D.

33:00.437 --> 33:02.223
Not everywhere.
The observatory.

33:03.690 --> 33:05.100
ZANE: Okay, we'll get Holly
to the observatory

33:05.275 --> 33:07.061
until you guys
finish the lattice.

33:07.569 --> 33:09.605
Carter, power up the console.
Got it.

33:10.280 --> 33:11.065
Jack, hurry.

33:21.500 --> 33:22.580
Holly's almost there.

33:22.751 --> 33:25.163
Holly's headed
your way, Jack.

33:27.297 --> 33:29.583
Still no node
in the observatory.

33:32.135 --> 33:33.124
Holly?

33:34.930 --> 33:35.965
Holly?

33:41.478 --> 33:42.388
She's here.

33:43.188 --> 33:47.431
What's going on?
Look, I can't tell you,
but a life is at stake.

33:48.068 --> 33:49.103
Sir.

33:49.986 --> 33:54.320
I'm sorry, Jo,
I gave you an order,
so unless you tell me...

33:54.491 --> 33:57.983
Now, that is one thing
I don't miss about
Special Forces.

33:58.954 --> 33:59.989
Orders.

34:00.664 --> 34:02.325
Now I'm going
to have to detain you.

34:02.499 --> 34:05.366
I know the way.
Let's go, boys.

34:13.843 --> 34:16.300
Jo must have
stopped the purge.

34:16.471 --> 34:17.802
It's safe for
Holly to go back
to the neural lab.

34:17.973 --> 34:20.339
Henry and Fargo
are waiting with
the memory lattice.

34:20.517 --> 34:21.848
That's right.

34:23.603 --> 34:27.141
Um, guys,
something is happening.

34:27.816 --> 34:29.397
(BEEPING)

34:30.193 --> 34:31.729
ZANE: It looks like
she's trapped there.

34:31.903 --> 34:33.018
We'll have to bring
the lattice to you.

34:33.655 --> 34:34.861
HENRY: Done. Go.

34:40.287 --> 34:43.074
Come on. Come on.
World's slowest
elevator, come on.

34:44.583 --> 34:47.290
Right, um,
beam containment,
breach imminent.

34:48.461 --> 34:49.371
That's not good.

34:50.589 --> 34:51.624
(GASPS) Wait!

34:52.215 --> 34:54.046
(READING)

34:54.217 --> 34:55.593
She's writing something.
Am I what?

34:56.970 --> 34:58.210
"N___"

34:59.514 --> 35:00.344
Run.

35:00.515 --> 35:01.300
CARTER: Guys?

35:02.976 --> 35:04.887
Holly's signal
must have damaged the
control system before.

35:05.061 --> 35:06.892
Jack, the laser's
about to go critical.

35:07.689 --> 35:08.678
If we don't stop it,
that explosion

35:08.857 --> 35:10.563
will level the top
three floors of G.D.

35:10.734 --> 35:12.224
I vote we stop it.
What do I do?

35:12.402 --> 35:14.063
Lots of buttons,
lots of buttons.

35:14.237 --> 35:15.477
Jack,dont
touch anything.

35:15.655 --> 35:16.644
The smallest
increase in voltage

35:16.823 --> 35:17.938
could set off the breach.

35:18.116 --> 35:19.902
Do you see the
collimating Q-switch?

35:21.369 --> 35:22.779
What does that
look like? I...

35:22.954 --> 35:25.036
I do know
what that looks like.

35:25.206 --> 35:27.037
Uh, Shaw impounded it.
It's not here anymore.

35:27.208 --> 35:28.584
What did it do?

35:29.044 --> 35:31.626
Q-switch would
have let us
shut down the laser.

35:33.882 --> 35:35.247
Lattice in.

35:36.051 --> 35:37.507
It should have
blown by now.

35:37.677 --> 35:39.213
Holly must be
containing the breach.

35:41.723 --> 35:44.089
Uh, she's not for long.

35:44.684 --> 35:46.424
Holly, we're ready for you.
Get out of there.

35:48.688 --> 35:49.803
(SCREAMING)

36:01.451 --> 36:02.566
(BOTH GROANING)

36:05.121 --> 36:06.531
Holly...

36:08.917 --> 36:10.077
(SIZZLING)

36:13.213 --> 36:14.544
So sorry, Fargo.

36:14.714 --> 36:17.126
ALLISON: Jack.
Jack, you guys okay?

36:17.926 --> 36:19.382
CARTER: We're okay.

36:20.428 --> 36:21.884
I don't think Holly is.

36:25.600 --> 36:26.385
(SIGHS)

36:39.906 --> 36:41.442
You want
to know the truth?

36:42.367 --> 36:43.698
Prison looks good on you.

36:44.828 --> 36:46.819
And now
my day is complete.

36:46.996 --> 36:50.204
Also, you look about
a thousand times hotter
with your hair down,

36:50.375 --> 36:52.832
and I really don't like
that chili you make,

36:53.002 --> 36:54.458
but I know
it's your dad's recipe,

36:54.629 --> 36:55.869
so I just shut
my mouth on that one.

36:56.047 --> 36:58.333
Now is not
the time, Zane.

36:58.508 --> 37:02.251
All right.
Well, just one last
piece of honesty.

37:04.973 --> 37:07.385
You put your ass
on the line
for Fargo today,

37:08.727 --> 37:09.432
for all of us.

37:09.602 --> 37:11.593
Yeah, well
a lot of good
that did me.

37:12.480 --> 37:13.731
Yeah, well,
this should help.

37:13.898 --> 37:15.809
The D.O.D. was very
distressed to learn

37:15.984 --> 37:17.349
that the PanOp system
malfunctioned and sent

37:17.527 --> 37:19.483
our sodium laser
into critical overload.

37:21.281 --> 37:23.613
Okay, that's not
quite what happened.

37:23.783 --> 37:26.570
Really? Then why do I have
fully documented forensics

37:26.745 --> 37:28.406
from the G.D. mainframe
proving that?

37:28.580 --> 37:33.574
Hmm. Look, I agreed
to be honest with you,

37:33.752 --> 37:35.162
not that DOD. asset.

37:37.547 --> 37:39.287
Speak of the devil.

37:39.466 --> 37:42.378
The D.O.D. says
to take your balls
and go home, Major.

37:42.552 --> 37:43.837
So it says.

37:44.012 --> 37:45.548
Yeah, and let Lupo out.

37:45.722 --> 37:48.589
She received
a commendation
and a pay raise.

37:48.975 --> 37:50.715
Paragraph five.

37:57.942 --> 38:00.934
I got to see about
a PanOp removal,
but be right there.

38:01.279 --> 38:02.268
Thanks.

38:02.822 --> 38:05.279
SHAW: I'll catch you later,
Mr. Donovan.

38:05.700 --> 38:07.611
lwouldn't count on it.

38:09.120 --> 38:10.496
(DOOR OPENING)

38:11.831 --> 38:13.492
So, uh,
what about Fargo?

38:14.584 --> 38:16.620
I think he's a danger
to himself and others,

38:18.338 --> 38:20.124
but his quick thinking
saved lives today

38:20.298 --> 38:22.163
and my report
will reflect that.

38:22.342 --> 38:23.582
Thank you, Major.

38:24.010 --> 38:26.752
I am, however, taking
the photonic plasma
computer with me.

38:27.472 --> 38:28.507
Sounds good.

38:28.681 --> 38:30.842
I was wrong about your
decision making, Jo.

38:31.643 --> 38:34.134
Your friends clearly
have your trust.

38:34.938 --> 38:36.394
I just hope
they all deserve it.

38:59.420 --> 39:02.207
(SIGHS) You pay people
to do that, you know.

39:05.635 --> 39:11.380
You need anything?
Like beer, or a hug?

39:13.893 --> 39:17.511
Yeah, I don't think
anything is going
to help except time.

39:18.523 --> 39:19.979
We were so close.

39:20.149 --> 39:21.855
I'm sorry, Fargo.

39:22.026 --> 39:24.233
Holly stayed
to buy us time.

39:25.947 --> 39:29.439
She sacrificed herself
for us, for me.

39:34.622 --> 39:37.989
If you need us,
we're here.

39:53.433 --> 39:55.389
I hate seeing him like this.

39:55.560 --> 39:57.721
Oh, it's going to take time.

39:58.271 --> 39:59.636
Allison, about
what I said...

39:59.814 --> 40:02.681
No, you just wanted
what was best for Fargo.

40:03.610 --> 40:04.770
We both did.

40:05.278 --> 40:07.439
You ready?
I'm starving.
Yeah.

40:07.614 --> 40:10.856
By the way, Allison,
you look smoking today.

40:11.034 --> 40:12.774
Honest with me, with me.

40:12.952 --> 40:13.941
Right. Yeah.

40:14.120 --> 40:15.405
Carter.
Good night.

40:17.582 --> 40:19.573
Hell of a day, huh?
(LAUGHS) Yeah.

40:19.751 --> 40:21.207
Zane lies to the DOD,

40:21.377 --> 40:22.366
Jo gets locked
in her own cell,

40:22.545 --> 40:24.752
and you are an accessory
to breaking and entering.

40:24.923 --> 40:28.290
Oh, that's nothing.
You went back in time
to save me once.

40:28.468 --> 40:29.753
I'd do it again.

40:35.975 --> 40:38.261
I'm just sorry
I didn't help
Holly and Fargo.

40:44.233 --> 40:46.098
Hey, Jack, just the man
l was looking for.

40:46.277 --> 40:47.938
Hey, sorry I couldn't be
more help with your research.

40:48.112 --> 40:50.023
I guess I don't
have superpowers.

40:50.198 --> 40:53.440
Well, actually, I've learned
quite a lot about Z waves.

40:53.618 --> 40:55.950
Oh, did it get you that
common ground with Grace?

40:56.120 --> 40:59.533
As a matter of fact,
I had a very interesting
conversation with her.

40:59.707 --> 41:00.617
Okay, what's
her perspective?

41:00.792 --> 41:02.623
She reminded me
that Descartes said,

41:02.794 --> 41:04.375
"I think, therefore, I am."

41:04.545 --> 41:09.756
Holly is a unique being,
she thinks, she creates,
remembers and loves.

41:09.926 --> 41:14.716
So, there is something
I'd like to try and
I'm going to need your help.

41:14.889 --> 41:16.220
Okay.

41:21.771 --> 41:25.229
You rebuilt
the memory lattice?
Mmm-hmm.

41:29.028 --> 41:30.643
Wasn't easy,
but for you...

41:30.822 --> 41:33.279
Henry? Henry?

41:34.534 --> 41:36.195
Boo!
(EXCLAIMS) Holly!

41:36.369 --> 41:40.157
Did I scare you?
Holly, you're out
and you're here.

41:40.331 --> 41:43.494
Yeah, and I'm still
a little mad at you.

41:44.752 --> 41:46.083
If you had asked me
about the sodium beacon,

41:46.254 --> 41:49.417
I could have told you
that model is prone
to terminal failover.

41:49.590 --> 41:50.921
But I guess you
figured that out yourself.

41:52.010 --> 41:55.423
Be mad, just promise me,
don't ever leave again.

41:55.888 --> 41:57.139
I don't plan to.

41:57.306 --> 41:58.842
SARAH: That is so romantic.

41:59.017 --> 42:01.303
I'm very excited
to have you here,
Dr. Marten.

42:01.477 --> 42:03.013
We're going to
be best friends.

42:03.187 --> 42:04.176
Sarah, do you mind?

42:04.355 --> 42:06.641
We're kind of having
a moment here.

42:06.816 --> 42:09.432
Sorry, pretend I'm not here.

42:10.903 --> 42:12.154
This is going
to be weird.

42:12.321 --> 42:16.064
Honestly, as long
as l have you,

42:17.201 --> 42:18.236
I don't care.

42:58.493 --> 43:02.827
