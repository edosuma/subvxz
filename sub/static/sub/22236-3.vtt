WEBVTT

00:00.179 --> 00:01.679
He's such an airhead.

00:01.698 --> 00:04.147
And his girlfriend,
so far up herself.

00:04.148 --> 00:07.833
- It's our anniversary.
- It's awesome, babe. Thank you.

00:07.834 --> 00:10.077
You wanna win so much,
there's a short cut.

00:10.078 --> 00:11.308
I'm slipping!

00:14.608 --> 00:17.271
- Mum, Dad.
- You've got me confused, mate.

00:17.320 --> 00:19.640
<i>My Mum's got a whole new life.</i>

00:19.641 --> 00:22.489
Oscar can walk but my family
can't remember me.

00:22.508 --> 00:25.075
Whatever's going on
happened to all of us.

00:25.105 --> 00:27.025
Every gang needs a hideout.

01:11.673 --> 01:15.847
Season 1, Episode 3

01:16.081 --> 01:19.081
Synced by Stubbie & Reef
www.addic7ed.com

01:36.583 --> 01:40.252
- What's that?
- Nothing. It's for a friend.

01:40.350 --> 01:43.796
Friend, huh?
Anyone I'd know?

01:43.797 --> 01:45.317
Maybe.

01:46.521 --> 01:50.925
He must be pretty cool, then, seeing
as you're carving his initials and stuff.

01:51.511 --> 01:55.432
Well, he thinks he is,
but he's not really.

01:56.886 --> 01:58.526
I bet he's the coolest.

02:06.017 --> 02:07.631
That's more like it.

02:22.322 --> 02:23.979
It'll always be there.

02:28.806 --> 02:32.046
- What are you doing?
- Reckon I could skate us back to shore?

02:33.387 --> 02:37.845
Hey. Come on. What are you doing?
Hey. Hey. Stop.

02:52.035 --> 02:54.915
Only two days out of date
and a little bit of mould.

02:55.154 --> 02:58.754
Brilliant. These will go well
with the five-day-old custard.

02:58.755 --> 03:00.073
Oh, yeah...

03:00.074 --> 03:02.529
- Come on. I'll boost you.
- Sorry, I'm germ-phobic.

03:02.793 --> 03:04.575
Then consider this therapy.

03:04.576 --> 03:06.616
Come on.
What would Bear Grylls do?

03:16.752 --> 03:20.354
Oh, I can feel the bacteria
attacking.

03:20.355 --> 03:21.793
All 10 million types.

03:21.794 --> 03:24.696
Right. Out.
Before I hit you mob for six.

03:24.707 --> 03:27.334
That's my Dad.
Come on, sink or swim, bro.

03:28.350 --> 03:30.999
I said out.

03:44.754 --> 03:48.077
Mm. Stale chips. Not bad.

03:48.078 --> 03:49.399
I'm not hungry.

03:49.400 --> 03:53.602
It has a distinct aroma
with a certain intense rubbishness.

03:53.603 --> 03:57.346
Full of surprises. Mould.
Grainy sugar.

03:57.347 --> 04:00.307
And a hint of cigarette butt.

04:01.191 --> 04:03.137
That explains it.

04:04.149 --> 04:06.683
I'm giving it a 3 out of 10.

04:07.477 --> 04:11.797
- Almost inedible. 2 out of 10.
- Big fat zero.

04:12.287 --> 04:14.087
My Mum makes these.

04:21.208 --> 04:23.876
We'll work this out.
I know it.

04:26.203 --> 04:29.172
How do you solve a problem
you can't even understand?

04:49.551 --> 04:51.591
What's that book
you're always looking at?

04:51.592 --> 04:52.792
My diary.

04:53.043 --> 04:57.425
I'm thinking about writing
a bestseller. About us.

04:57.429 --> 04:59.666
Four boys that no one can remember.

04:59.963 --> 05:03.723
- Have you worked out the ending?
- Not yet.

05:04.772 --> 05:07.493
It's a lot more than people
just forgetting us.

05:07.494 --> 05:09.203
It's like we don't even exist.

05:09.204 --> 05:12.082
- Irrational. We exist.
- Yeah? Prove it.

05:13.476 --> 05:15.396
- Geez.
- There's your proof.

05:15.397 --> 05:17.837
I mean, real evidence, Jake.
Records.

05:18.467 --> 05:20.227
Whoo-hoo.

05:21.446 --> 05:23.086
This is great.

05:23.907 --> 05:27.180
You know what? That might actually
be a good idea.

05:27.181 --> 05:30.101
- Wow. Thanks.
- School's enrolment records.

05:30.157 --> 05:32.997
You want to go to school? Really?
It's Saturday.

05:33.054 --> 05:35.006
I know. Perfect, isn't it?

05:35.007 --> 05:37.287
How can going to school
on a weekend be perfect?

05:37.288 --> 05:40.729
We gather the required information
and remain completely undetected.

05:40.820 --> 05:43.245
Sam. Sam.

05:44.183 --> 05:47.370
The freak and the nerd
want to go to school.

05:47.383 --> 05:50.270
- To check our names in the records.
- You coming?

05:50.271 --> 05:52.933
- There's proof in that boat over there.
- What?

05:53.322 --> 05:56.363
- I'll catch up, OK?
- OK.

05:56.364 --> 05:59.000
The school. See you there.

06:09.233 --> 06:10.833
Guys, wait up.

06:21.100 --> 06:23.909
It's still here. I've got proof.
Wait.

06:25.243 --> 06:26.815
Wait, guys.

06:29.946 --> 06:31.905
I so exist.

06:37.073 --> 06:40.603
In Year 8 I landed a month
of Saturday detention

06:40.684 --> 06:43.394
and apart from 101 ways
to clean graffiti off desks

06:43.395 --> 06:45.511
I did manage to pick up something.

06:45.798 --> 06:47.503
Watch and learn, amateurs.

06:50.901 --> 06:53.909
- So, you don't know the code.
- I know what it sounds like.

06:53.910 --> 06:55.230
Unbelievable.

07:04.467 --> 07:06.792
Sometimes my genius is a curse.

07:14.084 --> 07:17.995
The mission is "Do we exist". Agreed?
I'll examine the school records.

07:17.996 --> 07:20.356
I'll check the photos
outside the gym.

07:20.883 --> 07:24.003
- I don't know. Library. Year books.
- The library's closed.

07:24.004 --> 07:26.564
Did you not just witness the extent
of my powers?

07:39.699 --> 07:41.531
Who you waiting for?

07:42.197 --> 07:43.997
A friend.

07:44.240 --> 07:46.802
A friend, huh.
Anyone I'd know?

07:47.185 --> 07:49.303
Um, no.

07:49.339 --> 07:53.259
Not the beastly dude you've been
hanging around with the past year?

07:53.260 --> 07:55.230
What are you talking about?

07:55.363 --> 07:58.056
Look, can we stop
playing around now?

07:58.083 --> 08:01.043
- I'm not playing.
- Yes, you are.

08:01.637 --> 08:04.923
- Look, is this, like, a thing?
- "A thing"...?

08:04.963 --> 08:08.322
Yeah, like, you walk into people's
front yards and act all nutso.

08:08.323 --> 08:09.803
I'm not acting nutso.

08:09.804 --> 08:13.778
OK. Sorry. This is really weird
and I have this design to finish

08:13.779 --> 08:17.293
so it was really nice meeting you,
I guess, but I'm busy.

08:17.482 --> 08:21.723
- You really don't know who I am.
- I've never seen you before.

08:27.599 --> 08:29.279
Does this look familiar?

08:29.446 --> 08:30.806
Please.

08:31.403 --> 08:33.763
Look. It's the same.

08:36.775 --> 08:38.395
But I made that.

08:38.395 --> 08:41.182
I'm sorry I didn't get you a present,
if I could do it again...

08:41.183 --> 08:42.383
Sorry I'm late.

08:42.384 --> 08:45.904
Last night my sister had this genius idea
of putting fungal cream on her zits

08:45.905 --> 08:48.913
and now they're massive and
infected, almost like leprosy.

08:48.914 --> 08:52.636
So this morning she was in the bathroom
covering them with bandaids and crying.

08:52.637 --> 08:54.551
What are you doing here?

08:55.043 --> 08:59.914
- Who are you? Who is he?
- I don't know.

09:00.502 --> 09:02.664
Can we just go?

09:09.478 --> 09:11.078
Mia, wait.

09:13.662 --> 09:14.902
Mia.

09:43.121 --> 09:45.892
You'd think they'd want their
students to learn.

09:51.806 --> 09:54.986
The shrine to Jake Riles,
super athlete.

10:35.712 --> 10:37.192
Hey, Ellen.

10:38.278 --> 10:41.550
Nice costume. You going
undercover as boring.

10:41.855 --> 10:44.003
Two idiots in one day?

10:44.327 --> 10:46.927
It's like the Bremin
Moron Convention.

11:15.008 --> 11:17.344
We really don't exist.

11:17.373 --> 11:19.146
But what does that mean?

11:19.203 --> 11:21.883
There's no trace of us here.

11:22.003 --> 11:24.163
So, we're nothing.

11:30.994 --> 11:33.344
- Jake, don't.
- What does it matter?

11:33.345 --> 11:35.465
If we don't exist,
how can we get caught?

11:35.514 --> 11:36.845
I guess.

11:37.068 --> 11:40.338
So, then, if we don't exist,

11:40.947 --> 11:43.869
we don't have to follow
any boring rules.

11:43.870 --> 11:45.390
There are no punishments.

11:45.539 --> 11:47.363
We can do anything we want.

12:29.125 --> 12:30.725
Oops, sorry, Jake.

12:37.363 --> 12:39.523
Huh! Nice.

12:39.524 --> 12:41.569
We confirmed
that we no longer exist.

12:41.606 --> 12:44.966
Then we took the next logical step -
temporary madness.

12:44.967 --> 12:47.487
Go nuts, Sam. It will make you
feel better.

12:47.524 --> 12:48.764
No-one can catch you.

12:48.765 --> 12:51.602
It's actually surprising how much
that lessens the attraction.

12:51.603 --> 12:53.675
Of course we exist.

12:53.676 --> 12:55.349
Okay, after you guys
left this morning,

12:55.350 --> 12:57.799
I found a carving that
Mia and I did a month ago.

12:57.800 --> 13:00.963
- It's still there.
- Exactly the same. My initials.

13:00.964 --> 13:04.161
Maybe someone's deliberately
tried to erase our existences.

13:04.162 --> 13:05.998
Like, identity theft.

13:05.999 --> 13:08.202
Why would anyone try to steal
your identity?

13:08.203 --> 13:10.163
They haven't managed
to erase everything.

13:10.164 --> 13:14.885
- Have you seen Mia?
- Yeah, yeah. I showed her this.

13:15.283 --> 13:17.283
She acted as if
she didn't even know me.

13:17.443 --> 13:19.683
She knew me.
I could see it in her eyes.

13:19.684 --> 13:23.312
It's like when you can't remember a word
and it's on the tip of your tongue.

13:23.313 --> 13:25.398
You know, I just need to get
through to her somehow.

13:25.399 --> 13:27.126
Then you've got to take her
to the carving.

13:27.127 --> 13:28.872
She thinks I'm a psycho.

13:28.873 --> 13:30.233
Then take it to her.

13:30.234 --> 13:32.203
What, you want me to carry a boat
to her house?

13:32.204 --> 13:34.450
No. Idiot. A photo.

13:34.523 --> 13:37.724
- We could use the cameras on our phones.
- Negative. They're all dead.

13:37.725 --> 13:39.453
Well, my brother's got a digital camera.

13:39.454 --> 13:42.297
And when all of this is proved
to be completely pointless,

13:42.298 --> 13:43.818
we need food, blankets.

13:43.819 --> 13:46.974
- Deodorant for you, in particular.
- We ate rubbish, remember?

13:46.975 --> 13:50.097
My Dad's an outdoors nut. We've got
heaps of spare camping gear.

13:50.098 --> 13:51.314
You name it, we got it.

13:51.315 --> 13:54.226
I can grab my brother's camera
while I'm there. Now, who's in?

13:54.227 --> 13:55.588
- Me.
- Me.

13:57.544 --> 13:59.803
Fine, but Andy's coming with me
to get food.

13:59.805 --> 14:01.765
That's not fair. Why can't Jake?

14:01.766 --> 14:03.853
Doesn't your grandma own
the local Chinese restaurant?

14:03.854 --> 14:05.124
Oh, yeah.

14:05.149 --> 14:07.149
- Still not fair.
- Come on!

14:13.680 --> 14:15.169
Whoa.

14:16.523 --> 14:18.003
Lucky we don't exist.

14:28.642 --> 14:29.962
Sweet.

14:29.963 --> 14:32.803
That's the new stuff.
The old stuff's over here.

14:36.808 --> 14:39.489
How old were you
when you last used this?

14:39.490 --> 14:41.714
I was six, OK?

14:46.283 --> 14:48.083
What are you doing?

14:48.084 --> 14:51.284
Watch and behold.

15:03.217 --> 15:05.003
My super power.

15:06.270 --> 15:09.464
Two serves of 22, extra spicy.
Yep.

15:09.465 --> 15:13.202
Four 63s, a 54, and a 37.

15:13.203 --> 15:16.523
Yep. Delivered to 144 Acacia Court.

15:16.643 --> 15:18.243
Yes, in cash.

15:18.482 --> 15:21.204
- Get some lemon chicken.
- That's not even real Chinese.

15:21.205 --> 15:22.961
No, that's all, thanks.

15:25.719 --> 15:26.919
Now we wait.

15:58.343 --> 16:00.799
All hail King Vince.

16:01.163 --> 16:05.163
Sorry, Pete, must be hard coming
second. For your whole life.

16:14.839 --> 16:18.243
Oh, dude, that is rank, man.

16:18.308 --> 16:20.548
Ah, time out. I'm grabbing a juice.

16:20.549 --> 16:21.823
- Vince.
- What?

16:21.824 --> 16:24.304
Make me an egg sandwich,
or some baked beans.

16:24.305 --> 16:26.062
That is toxic, man.

16:29.823 --> 16:31.303
Hey.

16:33.243 --> 16:34.803
Cheat.

16:38.163 --> 16:41.243
Oh. I was supposed to be at cricket
15 minutes ago.

16:41.363 --> 16:43.283
Boofhead, can you give me a lift?

16:44.435 --> 16:46.762
Do I have to drive you everywhere?

16:48.422 --> 16:50.062
Got it. Got it.

16:52.120 --> 16:54.880
The ninja would observe their target
for weeks,

16:55.040 --> 16:58.520
in intimate knowledge
of their daily habits.

16:58.680 --> 17:00.800
The home delivery guy.
Here he comes.

17:00.960 --> 17:03.640
Our subject has a crush
on the newsagent.

17:03.800 --> 17:08.520
Every afternoon, he sneaks her over
a little package of xiaolongbao.

17:08.640 --> 17:10.000
Love dumplings.

17:15.031 --> 17:16.666
Ninja.

17:17.819 --> 17:21.248
- What now?
- Decoy's an essential element.

17:35.114 --> 17:37.511
Master. Apprentice.

17:39.924 --> 17:41.164
Clear enough?

17:45.348 --> 17:46.788
Kick a goal, mate.

17:47.330 --> 17:49.450
For all of us.

18:21.040 --> 18:23.767
OK. So it's all designed,
online, and ready to go.

18:23.786 --> 18:24.986
Awesome.

18:27.000 --> 18:28.397
Oh, no.

18:29.645 --> 18:31.005
Hey.

18:31.736 --> 18:34.559
Look, we're kind of having a meeting
right now.

18:34.560 --> 18:36.600
I've just got something to show you.

18:37.100 --> 18:40.559
Look, the red boat.
The carving.

18:40.560 --> 18:43.402
- We did this. Can you remember?
- Awkward.

18:43.470 --> 18:46.391
- Yeah. Of course I remember the carving.
- I knew it.

18:46.440 --> 18:48.640
But I didn't do that with you.

18:48.760 --> 18:52.640
I was with my boyfriend. Sammy.

18:52.760 --> 18:54.272
Sammy...?

18:59.476 --> 19:00.956
Who are you?

19:01.600 --> 19:03.259
That's my board.

19:03.993 --> 19:06.713
Are you that nut job
who came to my house yesterday?

19:06.714 --> 19:10.039
- What, your house?
- Yeah. My brothers told me about you.

19:10.040 --> 19:12.920
And what are you doing
talking to my girlfriend?

19:13.441 --> 19:16.325
- Give me my board. Hack.
- It's mine.

19:16.326 --> 19:19.537
Hand over my board and
leave us alone, stalker.

19:19.538 --> 19:22.679
Just stop it guys.
This is so stupid.

19:26.147 --> 19:27.817
Hey. My board!

19:27.997 --> 19:29.720
Run, stalker.

19:29.964 --> 19:31.324
So cute.

19:31.491 --> 19:34.531
Yet so mental. Shame.

19:35.800 --> 19:37.080
Come on, guys.

20:49.789 --> 20:53.118
Oh. Sorry, you frightened the life
out of me.

20:53.954 --> 20:56.868
- Are you looking for Sammy?
- Who is he?

20:56.869 --> 20:59.666
- What, love?
- That other boy.

20:59.920 --> 21:03.171
Why is he in our house and
why is he trying to be me?

21:03.172 --> 21:06.956
- Oh, sorry.
- Are you OK, Mum?

21:07.292 --> 21:10.520
Sweetie, I'm not your mum.

21:10.640 --> 21:12.480
I'm your son.

21:12.640 --> 21:14.520
You're not.

21:14.569 --> 21:18.289
Mum. Mum. Are you OK?

21:18.292 --> 21:19.991
Please, just listen to me.

21:19.992 --> 21:22.272
Every birthday
you make us cheesecake.

21:22.280 --> 21:24.354
The same your mum used to make
for you when you were a kid.

21:24.355 --> 21:25.266
What?

21:25.267 --> 21:27.627
And when you were my age,
you lived at the beach.

21:27.628 --> 21:30.148
- You were a junior surf champ.
- How do you know this?

21:30.176 --> 21:33.142
That's why I started skating.
So I could be just like you.

21:33.143 --> 21:35.023
I don't know
who you've been talking to.

21:35.024 --> 21:37.559
I miss you, Mum.
Please, just remember me.

21:44.000 --> 21:46.160
I think you've made a mistake.

21:46.824 --> 21:48.264
Mum!

21:49.704 --> 21:51.800
Mum. Mum!

22:06.405 --> 22:10.190
<i>Police, fire or ambulance?
Please state the nature of your emergency.</i>

22:10.191 --> 22:12.521
- Mum. Mum.
- <i>Hello?</i>

22:12.649 --> 22:16.169
<i>Hello. Please state the nature
of your emergency.</i>

22:16.170 --> 22:17.530
It's OK.

22:18.264 --> 22:20.079
Everything's alright.

22:35.022 --> 22:38.057
- Shouldn't we get Sam?
- We'll save him some.

22:38.246 --> 22:39.846
Out of your share.

22:42.714 --> 22:45.064
Number 63. Phoenix talons.

22:46.794 --> 22:48.354
Steamed chicken feet.

22:48.355 --> 22:51.472
Number 22. Szechuan liver
with snow peas.

22:51.473 --> 22:54.633
And number 54, the ultimate -

22:54.634 --> 22:57.433
chu kiok chou,
pig trotters and vinegar.

22:57.434 --> 23:00.953
- Yuck. Why'd you order that?
- Why'd you call me a nerd?

23:00.998 --> 23:03.718
Oh... I know I'm gonna regret this.

23:12.553 --> 23:14.113
Oh. Hot.

23:14.233 --> 23:17.834
- Ouch. What is that?
- Presumably a Szechuan pepper.

23:17.954 --> 23:20.161
Water. I need water.

23:20.169 --> 23:24.059
And... I nearly forgot. Number 37.
Lemon chicken.

23:27.634 --> 23:30.717
Mm. I guess it's edible.

23:32.234 --> 23:33.794
Well done.

23:34.319 --> 23:35.679
Nerd.

23:42.119 --> 23:44.246
There's food inside.

23:44.366 --> 23:46.486
Well, kind of.

23:47.606 --> 23:48.806
It's cool.

23:58.371 --> 24:01.611
Finding out you don't exist
kinda kills your appetite.

24:03.488 --> 24:06.168
And that your parents
had another kid and...

24:06.515 --> 24:09.406
- Gave him the same name.
- Yeah?

24:10.609 --> 24:12.049
Wow.

24:12.646 --> 24:14.726
I just kept thinking, "Not me".

24:15.882 --> 24:17.642
I'll be different, you know?

24:20.145 --> 24:21.625
And I am different.

24:24.394 --> 24:25.714
I'm replaced.

24:30.261 --> 24:31.726
What was that?

24:33.790 --> 24:35.710
I don't know but it has a friend.

24:36.167 --> 24:40.158
I was kind of hoping Andy's food would
be the weirdest thing that happened.

24:44.630 --> 24:45.830
What was that?

24:47.997 --> 24:49.738
Run. Run!

24:52.157 --> 24:54.159
- Jake, open the door!
- Open the door!

24:54.176 --> 24:56.649
- What's that?
- What?

24:57.212 --> 24:59.266
- Open it.
- It's stuck.

24:59.267 --> 25:01.187
Jake, come on, Jake.
Just open the door.

25:01.188 --> 25:03.202
I can't... I can't!

25:03.203 --> 25:05.768
- Jake. Jake!
- It's stuck.

25:07.118 --> 25:09.581
- What's going on?
- Something out there.

25:09.582 --> 25:11.588
- Something's coming.
- What is it?

25:11.589 --> 25:13.589
I think it's some kind
of evil spirit.

25:13.706 --> 25:16.133
- What?
- What? Like a ghost?

25:16.317 --> 25:18.237
There's no such thing as ghosts.

25:18.248 --> 25:21.568
There's no such thing as ghosts.
There's no such thing as ghosts.

25:21.837 --> 25:24.050
There's no such thing as ghosts.

25:26.536 --> 25:27.876
Guys...?

25:27.877 --> 25:29.356
It was no storm.

25:29.357 --> 25:32.235
I think there might be forces at play
which we don't understand.

25:32.236 --> 25:34.316
That's it. Wormholes.

25:34.317 --> 25:38.031
We are the matter, slipping between
infinite variations of the same reality.

25:38.056 --> 25:39.379
Pervert!

25:41.081 --> 25:43.361
She was that creepy woman
from the forest.

25:43.397 --> 25:46.397
- She was watching us.
- You used to have a book back there.

25:46.398 --> 25:48.078
That's not kid's stuff.

25:48.357 --> 25:51.172
What if we're unconscious?
We have to wake ourselves.
