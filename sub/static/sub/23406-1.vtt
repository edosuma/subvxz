WEBVTT

00:20.448 --> 00:22.000
- Hey, Matt.

00:22.103 --> 00:23.103
Got your email
with the report.

00:23.206 --> 00:24.689
Thanks so much
for sending.

00:24.793 --> 00:27.068
Question:
did you CC John on that?

00:27.172 --> 00:28.689
- Uh, yes.
I believe I did.

00:28.793 --> 00:30.275
- Oh, that's interesting,
'cause I'm looking

00:30.379 --> 00:32.965
at that email right now,
and you didn't.

00:33.068 --> 00:33.931
- Oh.

00:34.034 --> 00:35.620
- You BCC'd me.

00:35.724 --> 00:37.517
- Oh.
Uh...

00:37.620 --> 00:38.793
You still got the email then,
right?

00:38.896 --> 00:40.034
- I did.
- Look.

00:40.137 --> 00:41.275
I know you're new around here,
so I just want to

00:41.379 --> 00:43.413
make sure that you understand
the email protocol.

00:43.517 --> 00:47.275
You always CC both John and I
on all work emails,

00:47.379 --> 00:49.896
'cause if you BCC him,
then I can't check

00:50.000 --> 00:52.034
to make sure
that you CC'd him, hmm?

00:52.137 --> 00:53.103
- Got it.

00:53.206 --> 00:54.896
I made a mistake.
- Great.

00:55.000 --> 00:58.379
Question: why did you
make that mistake?

00:58.482 --> 00:59.517
- Um...

00:59.620 --> 01:01.034
I guess I'm a little tired
this morning.

01:01.137 --> 01:02.172
- Aww, gosh.
- Uh-huh.

01:02.275 --> 01:04.586
Why are you so tired?

01:04.689 --> 01:06.896
- I have anxiety that sometimes
keeps me up at night.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.068
- What causes this anxiety?

01:09.172 --> 01:10.517
- I guess sometimes
I feel like this can be

01:10.620 --> 01:12.655
sort of a confrontational
work environment.

01:12.758 --> 01:14.310
- Hey, bud,
Hampton DeVille encourages

01:14.413 --> 01:16.137
aggressive
confrontational criticism.

01:16.241 --> 01:17.827
- Why don't you
like confrontation?

01:17.931 --> 01:18.965
Defend your position.

01:19.068 --> 01:20.344
- Oh.
Uh...

01:20.448 --> 01:22.344
No, I mean, I think
confrontation is a good thing.

01:22.448 --> 01:23.586
It's just sometimes
confrontation

01:23.689 --> 01:25.034
hurts my job performance

01:25.137 --> 01:27.172
and damages
my personal wellbeing.

01:27.275 --> 01:28.344
- Uh-oh; well, if you can't

01:28.448 --> 01:30.068
manage your emotions, Matt,

01:30.172 --> 01:31.310
what makes you think
you're qualified

01:31.413 --> 01:33.724
to manage people
at this company?

01:33.827 --> 01:34.896
- Honestly, I don't know.

01:35.000 --> 01:35.896
- Oh.

01:36.000 --> 01:37.827
- I never really
saw myself here.

01:37.931 --> 01:40.379
I mean, after college,
I volunteered for a program

01:40.482 --> 01:43.931
teaching underprivileged kids
because I wanted to help people,

01:44.034 --> 01:46.034
but then one of the students
stabbed me,

01:46.137 --> 01:48.000
and the school was pretty dirty

01:48.103 --> 01:50.310
and I just realized
I wasn't cut out for it.

01:50.413 --> 01:53.172
So I moved back in
with my parents,

01:53.275 --> 01:55.413
which, I'm pretty sure
led to them getting a divorce,

01:55.517 --> 01:58.379
because that's what
they told me happened.

01:58.482 --> 02:02.310
Then I worked a series of jobs
that eventually landed me here,

02:02.413 --> 02:03.551
where I'm just a cog

02:03.655 --> 02:05.793
in a soulless corporate machine,
and I'm not--

02:05.896 --> 02:07.724
- Okay, well,
just make sure that you CC

02:07.827 --> 02:09.655
both John and I
on all work emails.

02:09.758 --> 02:10.793
It's a simple mistake,

02:10.896 --> 02:12.137
but it's just important
to follow protocol.

02:12.241 --> 02:13.103
- Yes.

02:13.206 --> 02:15.310
Jake, question:

02:15.413 --> 02:16.448
why do you think it's okay

02:16.551 --> 02:18.310
to come in to work
with your shirt untucked?

02:18.413 --> 02:21.206
- Because life is meaningless,
and nothing we do matters.

02:21.310 --> 02:22.448
- Okay, great.

02:22.551 --> 02:24.137
- Have a great day, you two.
- Thanks, guys.

02:45.827 --> 02:48.551
- Hampton DeVille has emerged
as one of the largest,

02:48.655 --> 02:51.551
most profitable corporations
in the world,

02:51.655 --> 02:54.586
with over 300,000 employees
internationally,

02:54.689 --> 02:57.482
their footprint
stretches across the globe.

02:57.586 --> 03:00.344
Under the leadership
of their CEO Christian DeVille,

03:00.448 --> 03:02.551
they've become market leaders
in everything

03:02.655 --> 03:05.758
from agricultural goods
to pharmaceuticals,

03:05.862 --> 03:09.482
from household appliances
to industrial weaponry.

03:09.586 --> 03:11.344
You've probably
heard their slogan.

03:11.448 --> 03:14.517
Hampton DeVille:
we make everything.

03:14.620 --> 03:17.551
But now they are attempting
to muscle their way

03:17.655 --> 03:20.793
up the highly competitive
tech industry.

03:20.896 --> 03:23.620
Today marks the launch
of the Obelisk,

03:23.724 --> 03:25.896
Hampton DeVille's
touch screen tablet

03:26.000 --> 03:27.241
which boasts a screen

03:27.344 --> 03:30.620
eight times the size
of the iPad.

03:30.724 --> 03:33.482
But that launch
may be in jeopardy

03:33.586 --> 03:35.586
after an insensitive tweet
was sent out

03:35.689 --> 03:38.241
from Hampton DeVille's
twitter account earlier today.

03:38.344 --> 03:41.758
As Hurricane Letisha continues
to devastate the Gulf Coast,

03:41.862 --> 03:43.344
Hampton DeVille tweeted,

03:43.448 --> 03:46.275
"Was your house blown away
by Hurricane Letisha?

03:46.379 --> 03:49.206
"Pick up the Obelisk
to follow hurricane news.

03:49.310 --> 03:51.620
You'll be blown away
by the size."

03:51.724 --> 03:53.655
In response
to the offensive tweet,

03:53.758 --> 03:57.241
the Internet is calling for
a boycott of the Obelisk.

04:15.724 --> 04:17.344
- Do you think we're gonna
get to eat anything today?

04:17.448 --> 04:18.413
- Don't count on it.

04:18.517 --> 04:20.482
There's a rigid
food hierarchy here.

04:20.586 --> 04:22.655
Executives get first pick,
then junior executives,

04:22.758 --> 04:24.482
then us, the junior executives
in training.

04:24.586 --> 04:26.379
- $500 billion corporation

04:26.482 --> 04:28.310
and they never have enough
bagels for everyone.

04:28.413 --> 04:30.034
- Why didn't you eat breakfast
before work?

04:30.137 --> 04:31.241
- I didn't have time.

04:31.344 --> 04:33.379
I hit the snooze button
15 times this morning,

04:33.482 --> 04:36.448
which is a new record that
I'm actually kind of proud of.

04:36.551 --> 04:37.862
Did you eat anything?

04:37.965 --> 04:38.758
- No.

04:38.862 --> 04:40.068
I'm trying to
watch my figure.

04:40.172 --> 04:41.275
I want to have a hot body

04:41.379 --> 04:43.172
'cause I'm tired of
developing my personality.

04:43.275 --> 04:44.517
- Yeah, I've been there.

04:44.620 --> 04:45.862
- Yum.

04:45.965 --> 04:47.000
I love eclairs.

04:47.103 --> 04:49.275
- Oh, my god.
This is so good.

04:49.379 --> 04:52.344
I'm gonna take two.

04:52.448 --> 04:53.793
- Aggressive.

04:53.896 --> 04:55.103
Confident.

04:55.206 --> 04:58.241
I like that you're not afraid
to take what you want.

05:00.827 --> 05:02.931
- Damn it.
There's only two bagels left.

05:03.034 --> 05:04.724
- Whoa, have you seen this tweet
the company sent out?

05:04.827 --> 05:06.586
The Internet is freaking out
about it.

05:06.689 --> 05:08.724
- "You'll be blown away
by the size"?

05:08.827 --> 05:09.758
Jesus Christ.

05:09.862 --> 05:11.551
We're living
inside of a nightmare.

05:16.103 --> 05:17.586
- Why in the fuck

05:17.689 --> 05:19.862
is everyone
standing around eating bagels

05:19.965 --> 05:22.275
while we are being crucified
on the Internet?

05:22.379 --> 05:25.172
Spit out those bagels!
We have work to do!

05:29.689 --> 05:30.862
- No!

05:30.965 --> 05:33.275
Sorry.

05:33.379 --> 05:35.275
- Everyone in this room,

05:35.379 --> 05:37.379
look to your left.

05:39.310 --> 05:41.379
Now...

05:41.482 --> 05:43.827
look to your right.

05:43.931 --> 05:46.689
100% of those people

05:46.793 --> 05:50.448
are ruining my fucking day.

05:50.551 --> 05:52.206
- Look, that one over there's
still good.

05:52.310 --> 05:53.551
I'm gonna get it
after the meeting.

05:53.655 --> 05:55.137
- Yeah,
but there's no cream cheese.

05:55.241 --> 05:57.310
On the wall over there.

05:57.413 --> 05:58.655
- Into developing the Obelisk,

05:58.758 --> 06:01.068
and now its success
is being threatened

06:01.172 --> 06:02.931
by a fucking tweet.

06:05.344 --> 06:06.655
Fuck you.

06:08.551 --> 06:10.448
- I wish I could be
more like Christian.

06:10.551 --> 06:12.344
- Why? He acts like
a complete psychopath

06:12.448 --> 06:13.793
and nobody stands up to him.

06:13.896 --> 06:14.655
- Exactly.

06:14.758 --> 06:15.655
He fought his way to the top,

06:15.758 --> 06:16.724
and now he gets to treat people

06:16.827 --> 06:18.620
like they're
his personal service dogs.

06:18.724 --> 06:19.862
- If I ever get to the top,
I'm gonna at least

06:19.965 --> 06:21.931
make sure everyone
gets a goddamn bagel.

06:22.034 --> 06:22.793
- Don't worry.

06:22.896 --> 06:24.137
You'll be corrupted by power.

06:24.241 --> 06:25.344
That's part of growing up.

06:25.448 --> 06:27.931
- I want to tell you a story.

06:28.034 --> 06:29.758
It's about a shepherd.

06:29.862 --> 06:32.137
One day,
he lost his entire flock.

06:32.241 --> 06:34.172
I mean, every single sheep
took off

06:34.275 --> 06:36.000
except one.

06:37.758 --> 06:38.931
So there he is,
out in the middle

06:39.034 --> 06:41.241
of this open field
with just one sheep,

06:41.344 --> 06:43.137
and what do you think he did?

06:45.103 --> 06:48.517
He pulled out a gun,
and he blew its brains out.

06:48.620 --> 06:51.482
Then he went out
and got himself a real job,

06:51.586 --> 06:53.448
because being a shepherd

06:53.551 --> 06:56.379
pays shit.

06:56.482 --> 06:58.896
Well, people, that ain't me.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.413
Because we are
in cattle country,

07:01.517 --> 07:02.827
and I am Ben Cartwright,

07:02.931 --> 07:05.724
and this is fucking "Bonanza!"

07:13.758 --> 07:15.206
So how bad is this?

07:15.310 --> 07:17.517
- We ran the numbers,
and more people are outraged

07:17.620 --> 07:19.344
about the tweet than they are
about the hurricane.

07:19.448 --> 07:21.206
- Comparatively,
people like the hurricane

07:21.310 --> 07:22.862
more than they like
the tweet.

07:22.965 --> 07:24.034
- Jesus Christ.

07:24.137 --> 07:26.172
We have got to distract people
from this tweet.

07:26.275 --> 07:27.551
So what are our options?

07:27.655 --> 07:29.103
Can we start
a different hurricane?

07:29.206 --> 07:31.344
Have we finished building
that hurricane machine yet?

07:31.448 --> 07:33.551
- Uh...

07:33.655 --> 07:34.793
- Sir, I--

07:34.896 --> 07:37.896
I believe
I speak for everyone--

07:38.000 --> 07:39.448
Bruce?

07:39.551 --> 07:41.137
When I say
we thought you were joking

07:41.241 --> 07:42.793
when you asked us to do that.

07:42.896 --> 07:46.000
- I would never joke
about hurricanes.

07:46.103 --> 07:48.241
That's what got us
into this mess.

07:48.344 --> 07:49.482
- Does it ever bother you

07:49.586 --> 07:52.137
that the corporation we work for
is, like, evil?

07:52.241 --> 07:53.448
- Every corporation is evil.

07:53.551 --> 07:55.689
At least we get health benefits.
- Yeah.

07:55.793 --> 07:57.310
Wait.
You get health benefits?

07:57.413 --> 07:58.793
- Sir,

07:58.896 --> 08:01.689
they're turning you
into a meme on the Internet.

08:07.689 --> 08:09.586
- We'll see
who has a small penis

08:09.689 --> 08:13.137
once I have
my hurricane machine.

08:13.241 --> 08:15.379
And you two need to find out who
wrote that tweet and fire them.

08:15.482 --> 08:16.448
- We're on top of it, sir.

08:16.551 --> 08:18.172
- We will handle it
personally.

08:18.275 --> 08:19.344
You two need to find out

08:19.448 --> 08:20.896
who wrote that tweet
and fire them.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.275
- Thought you guys said
you would do it.

08:22.379 --> 08:24.000
- Telling you to do it
is doing it.

08:24.103 --> 08:25.896
- Yeah, you guys
should be excited.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.655
We want to use you as our tools
in this situation.

08:28.758 --> 08:30.379
- Yes, think of yourself
as tools.

08:30.482 --> 08:31.896
- You guys are tools.

08:33.482 --> 08:34.620
- I don't know
if I can fire someone.

08:34.724 --> 08:36.275
I hate confrontation.

08:36.379 --> 08:37.620
When I first met
my brother-in-law,

08:37.724 --> 08:39.689
he thought my name was Mark,
and I never corrected him.

08:39.793 --> 08:41.655
So now I just don't go to
Thanksgiving anymore.

08:41.758 --> 08:43.517
- Dude, you don't get it.
This is big.

08:43.620 --> 08:44.827
Getting to fire someone

08:44.931 --> 08:46.827
is like when a mafia don
sends you on your first hit.

08:46.931 --> 08:48.482
It means we're in.
- What if I don't want to do it?

08:48.586 --> 08:49.620
- Then we get whacked.

08:49.724 --> 08:50.689
- I think if I was in the mafia,

08:50.793 --> 08:51.793
I would just be the guy

08:51.896 --> 08:53.068
who stayed home
and made spaghetti.

08:53.172 --> 08:54.931
- This is the first time
in five years of working here

08:55.034 --> 08:56.862
that I've been given
any sort of power.

08:56.965 --> 08:59.172
And I'm going to abuse it
for all that it's worth.

09:02.896 --> 09:04.034
- Can I tell you something else?

09:04.137 --> 09:06.448
The idea of firing someone
kind of turns me on.

09:06.551 --> 09:08.620
- Your sexuality worries me.
- Me too.

09:08.724 --> 09:10.275
I don't understand
the porn I'm into these days.

09:10.379 --> 09:12.379
- Jake, please don't tell me
what kind of porn you watch.

09:12.482 --> 09:13.586
- Tentacle porn?

09:13.689 --> 09:15.034
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I've watched that.

09:15.137 --> 09:16.896
But honestly, nowadays,
my ideal porn

09:17.000 --> 09:18.551
would just be
all of my ex-girlfriends

09:18.655 --> 09:20.206
saying sorry to me
at the same time.

09:20.310 --> 09:22.517
- That already exists.
It's called apology bukakke.

09:22.620 --> 09:23.689
Hey, Grace.

09:23.793 --> 09:25.344
- Hi, guys.
What's up?

09:25.448 --> 09:27.620
- We need to know who runs the
Hampton DeVille twitter account.

09:27.724 --> 09:28.931
- Okay.

09:29.034 --> 09:30.862
Looks like that would be Baron.

09:30.965 --> 09:33.586
He's our social media "guru."

09:33.689 --> 09:35.482
Wait.
Is this about that tweet?

09:35.586 --> 09:38.137
- Yeah, John and Kate said we
have to fire whoever wrote it.

09:38.241 --> 09:40.344
- They're finally
letting you guys fire someone?

09:40.448 --> 09:42.413
Congratulations.

09:42.517 --> 09:43.586
Who's gonna pull the trigger?

09:43.689 --> 09:44.655
- I am.

09:44.758 --> 09:46.689
He's just gonna watch.

09:50.793 --> 09:52.137
- Look at these people.

09:52.241 --> 09:54.793
Is everyone at this company
clinically depressed?

09:54.896 --> 09:56.413
- Everyone here
is hanging by a thread.

09:56.517 --> 09:57.827
They could snap at any moment.

09:57.931 --> 09:59.551
- These were all children once.

09:59.655 --> 10:01.620
Happy, innocent children.

10:01.724 --> 10:03.931
And now look at them.
How did this happen?

10:04.034 --> 10:05.965
- They're all just trying
to fill the void.

10:06.068 --> 10:06.965
- The void?

10:07.068 --> 10:08.137
- You know,

10:08.241 --> 10:10.827
the emptiness
that exists inside all of us.

10:10.931 --> 10:12.034
- Oh, right.
Of course.

10:13.586 --> 10:15.137
The void.

10:25.689 --> 10:26.862
- Watch this.

10:26.965 --> 10:28.827
I'm gonna
take this guy out.

10:31.448 --> 10:33.068
Hey, Baron.

10:33.172 --> 10:34.344
Listen up.

10:34.448 --> 10:35.931
We know
you wrote that tweet.

10:36.034 --> 10:38.482
You're a bad employee,
an even worse person,

10:38.586 --> 10:39.931
and even bigger loser.

10:40.034 --> 10:42.275
Your only job is to tweet,

10:42.379 --> 10:44.620
yet you still managed
to ruin the reputation

10:44.724 --> 10:48.068
of the entire company,
so guess what.

10:48.172 --> 10:49.931
You're fired.

10:52.137 --> 10:53.137
What's your name?

10:53.241 --> 10:54.448
- Jake Levinson.

10:54.551 --> 10:56.896
- You know what's cool about
the Internet, Jake Levinson?

10:57.000 --> 10:58.379
It keeps a record of
pretty much everything

10:58.482 --> 11:00.862
you ever say or do.

11:00.965 --> 11:02.103
For example,
I just found this video

11:02.206 --> 11:03.931
of the punk band
you sang for in college.

11:04.034 --> 11:05.172
- Oh, no.

11:05.275 --> 11:07.275
♪ Don't get a job,
fight the government ♪

11:07.379 --> 11:10.344
♪ Steal from the rich,
punch the president ♪

11:10.448 --> 11:11.724
- And what's your name?

11:11.827 --> 11:12.965
- I'm not going to tell you,
because I never figured out

11:13.068 --> 11:15.172
how to deactivate my LiveJournal
from high school.

11:15.275 --> 11:17.379
- Listen up,
you spineless yuppies!

11:17.482 --> 11:19.344
I fucking
own the Internet.

11:19.448 --> 11:22.586
You remember that, uh,
Egyptian revolution in 2011?

11:22.689 --> 11:24.655
I started that shit
with a single hashtag.

11:24.758 --> 11:26.275
I can't point Egypt out
on a map,

11:26.379 --> 11:28.758
but I toppled a dictatorship
that ruled for decades

11:28.862 --> 11:30.758
because I was bored.

11:30.862 --> 11:31.896
So don't come in here

11:32.000 --> 11:34.758
pretending like
you're in control of me.

11:34.862 --> 11:35.862
- Fuck you, mom!

11:35.965 --> 11:40.034
- I'm a social...media...guru.

11:40.137 --> 11:43.517
And you will bow down before me.

11:43.620 --> 11:44.551
Also I didn't tweet it.

11:44.655 --> 11:47.241
It was Richard.

11:47.344 --> 11:50.793
- I will not be a slave
to the corporate system.

11:52.000 --> 11:53.620
- Hi, Richard, I'm Matt.
This is Jake.

11:53.724 --> 11:55.310
We're junior executives
in training.

11:55.413 --> 11:56.310
- Whoa, executives?

11:56.413 --> 11:57.344
That's cool.

11:57.448 --> 11:58.586
- Yes, it is cool.

11:58.689 --> 11:59.793
So, Richard, we understand
you're in charge

11:59.896 --> 12:01.137
of the Hampton DeVille
twitter account.

12:01.241 --> 12:02.758
- Yep.
I get paid to tweet all day.

12:02.862 --> 12:04.034
My job's awesome.

12:04.137 --> 12:06.206
- So then you tweeted
the blown away tweet.

12:06.310 --> 12:08.310
- Yeah, it seems like people
are really upset about it,

12:08.413 --> 12:10.758
but I think it's really clever,
'cause, see, like,

12:10.862 --> 12:13.689
people were blown away
by Hurricane Letisha,

12:13.793 --> 12:16.758
and I said,
"blown away by the size."

12:16.862 --> 12:17.689
It's a pun.

12:17.793 --> 12:18.724
People just don't get it.

12:18.827 --> 12:20.310
- No, I think everyone got it.

12:20.413 --> 12:21.448
- Speaking of getting it,

12:21.551 --> 12:22.655
you might want to bite down
on that fork,

12:22.758 --> 12:24.241
because what I'm
about to say is gonna hurt.

12:24.344 --> 12:25.413
- Hold on a second.

12:25.517 --> 12:27.137
Where are you getting
all of that cake from?

12:27.241 --> 12:30.896
- Oh, you guys want to see
something cool?

12:31.000 --> 12:32.137
I don't know
if you're interested,

12:32.241 --> 12:33.827
but I keep track of
all the cakes in the building.

12:33.931 --> 12:35.896
Today's a big one: 19 cakes.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
We can hit 'em all,
but we gotta move fast.

12:39.551 --> 12:40.689
You guys hungry?

12:44.034 --> 12:46.551
First, we'll hit
Ron's 53rd birthday, floor 67.

12:46.655 --> 12:47.827
Congrats!
Come on in.

12:47.931 --> 12:50.482
This is Jake and Matt.
We're here for some cake.

12:50.586 --> 12:52.241
- Mmm!

12:52.344 --> 12:55.068
- Then Tina's baby shower,
floor 84.

12:55.172 --> 12:57.172
- So who's the father?
Do you know who the father is?

12:57.275 --> 12:58.965
- Then Bill Peterson's
successful

12:59.068 --> 13:01.241
gastric bypass surgery,
floor 11.

13:01.344 --> 13:03.482
- I love your hair.
You look fantastic.

13:07.586 --> 13:09.241
- Oh, my god, this is the best
thing I've ever tasted.

13:09.344 --> 13:10.724
- Just a few more parties,
then we have to fire him.

13:12.896 --> 13:14.586
- Colin, Michael, Jessica, Erin.

13:14.689 --> 13:16.103
- Jessica, Erin, Colleen--

13:16.206 --> 13:18.344
You're not Colleen, obviously.
You're a man.

13:23.793 --> 13:25.965
Happy fucking birthday!

13:26.068 --> 13:27.413
Whoo!
- Richard's great.

13:27.517 --> 13:29.310
This company would be better
if more people were like him.

13:29.413 --> 13:30.931
- He's just filling his void
with sugar.

13:31.034 --> 13:32.413
He clearly
has an eating disorder.

13:32.517 --> 13:33.724
- Let's do shots.

13:47.724 --> 13:48.655
- I love you, Richard.

13:48.758 --> 13:49.758
- I love this guy.

13:51.344 --> 13:52.862
I know we work
for a big corporation,

13:52.965 --> 13:54.068
but it's not that bad.

13:54.172 --> 13:55.448
The people here are great.

13:55.551 --> 13:56.724
Feels like a family.

13:56.827 --> 13:58.551
And we got health benefits.
- Yeah.

13:58.655 --> 14:00.620
Wait, you get health benefits?

14:00.724 --> 14:02.137
- So where are we
going next?

14:02.241 --> 14:03.689
- Next we're gonna
go to the bathroom,

14:03.793 --> 14:04.965
because I have to
throw up.

14:10.689 --> 14:11.931
- God, I feel like garbage.

14:12.034 --> 14:13.965
I can't party the way I used to.

14:14.068 --> 14:16.068
- Matt.
Jake.

14:16.172 --> 14:18.172
The fact that you're sitting
around covered in cake frosting

14:18.275 --> 14:19.413
means you must have
found the person

14:19.517 --> 14:21.620
responsible for that tweet
and fired them.

14:21.724 --> 14:23.103
- So, who was it?

14:23.206 --> 14:25.413
- Well, uh,
we have some great news.

14:25.517 --> 14:27.103
We found the guy
responsible for the tweet,

14:27.206 --> 14:28.758
and he's a great guy.

14:28.862 --> 14:30.034
We totally lectured him about

14:30.137 --> 14:31.620
how it's bad that he did that,

14:31.724 --> 14:33.241
so now he knows
not to do it again.

14:33.344 --> 14:36.724
And anyway, we like him a lot,
and we think he's a total pro.

14:36.827 --> 14:38.896
- Phew!
Let me tell you something.

14:39.000 --> 14:40.448
Best thing about cake,

14:40.551 --> 14:42.655
it tastes just as good
coming back up.

14:42.758 --> 14:45.655
Oh, I should tweet that.

14:45.758 --> 14:47.103
Oh!
Hi, I'm Richard.

14:47.206 --> 14:48.689
- Hey, Richard.
We're executives.

14:48.793 --> 14:50.517
- Wow.
More executives.

14:50.620 --> 14:51.482
This is cool.

14:51.586 --> 14:52.862
- Yes, it is cool.

14:52.965 --> 14:55.931
Question: did you write that
blown away tweet?

14:56.034 --> 14:57.448
- Yeah.
That was me.

14:57.551 --> 14:58.793
- Whoops.
- Okay, great.

14:58.896 --> 14:59.965
You're fired.

15:00.068 --> 15:01.793
Please report to HR
immediately.

15:01.896 --> 15:02.896
- What?

15:03.000 --> 15:04.827
- And you two, question.

15:04.931 --> 15:06.275
How could you do this to us?

15:06.379 --> 15:08.310
- We used you as our tools,

15:08.413 --> 15:10.241
and this is how you repay us?

15:10.344 --> 15:11.448
- We'll deal with you later.

15:11.551 --> 15:12.586
But in the meantime,

15:12.689 --> 15:15.137
I suggest you start
working on your résumés.

15:17.689 --> 15:19.034
- This is
company property.

15:20.379 --> 15:21.931
- Well, that's it.
We're dead.

15:22.034 --> 15:22.931
- So, wait.

15:23.034 --> 15:24.172
You guys knew
I was getting fired,

15:24.275 --> 15:25.689
and you used me to get cake?

15:25.793 --> 15:27.275
- No, Richard,
it's not like that.

15:27.379 --> 15:29.275
If it were up to us,
you'd get to keep your job.

15:29.379 --> 15:30.896
- Yeah, but it's not up to you.

15:31.000 --> 15:32.241
You guys are just tools.

15:32.344 --> 15:34.655
- Exactly.
We're tools.

15:34.758 --> 15:36.275
- So fuck you!

15:37.620 --> 15:39.827
Fuck all of you!

15:39.931 --> 15:42.862
You're all just
corporate drones!

15:42.965 --> 15:45.413
Fuck Hampton DeVille!

15:45.517 --> 15:47.448
Fuck the Internet!

15:47.551 --> 15:49.551
And fuck birthdays!

15:52.517 --> 15:54.172
Fuck your meeting!

15:55.068 --> 15:57.172
Fuck you, Angela!

16:01.172 --> 16:02.793
- Do you think
Richard's okay?

16:02.896 --> 16:05.827
- How can you think about other
people at a time like this?

16:15.068 --> 16:16.689
Maybe getting fired
is a good thing.

16:16.793 --> 16:17.896
I could finally pursue my dream

16:18.000 --> 16:19.689
of starting
my own craft brewery.

16:19.793 --> 16:21.137
Or just go to law school.

16:21.241 --> 16:22.379
- Applying to law school
in your late 20s

16:22.482 --> 16:24.275
is a major sign of depression.

16:24.379 --> 16:26.482
- What are you gonna do?
- I don't know.

16:26.586 --> 16:29.275
Working here was my plan B,
and now I'm getting fired,

16:29.379 --> 16:32.034
so I guess it's time for plan C.

16:32.137 --> 16:33.137
- Suicide?

16:33.241 --> 16:34.620
- Yes.
You already knew.

16:34.724 --> 16:35.724
That's why we're friends.

16:35.827 --> 16:37.931
- Hey, guys,
did you fire Richard?

16:38.034 --> 16:39.793
'Cause he never
showed up to HR.

16:41.896 --> 16:43.137
- There is an Internet campaign

16:43.241 --> 16:45.000
to boycott
all Hampton DeVille products

16:45.103 --> 16:47.655
unless you apologize
for the tweet.

16:47.758 --> 16:49.000
Will you apologize?

16:49.103 --> 16:52.068
- Look, I refuse to negotiate
with the Internet.

16:52.172 --> 16:54.620
That tweet was the act
of one rogue employee.

16:54.724 --> 16:56.448
And I would like to state
for the record

16:56.551 --> 17:00.034
that I love
hurricane victims,

17:00.137 --> 17:01.482
and anyone
who knows me can verify--

17:01.586 --> 17:03.793
- Excuse me, Christian, I'm
gonna have to interrupt you.

17:03.896 --> 17:05.758
We're getting
a breaking tweet.

17:07.448 --> 17:09.586
A new tweet has been issued
from Hampton DeVille--

17:09.689 --> 17:11.103
- Ugh, Richard's not here.

17:11.206 --> 17:12.482
- "My name is Richard.

17:12.586 --> 17:15.241
"I wrote the blown away tweet,
got fired,

17:15.344 --> 17:17.344
"and now I'm going to
kill myself

17:17.448 --> 17:19.724
by being blown away
off of a building."

17:19.827 --> 17:21.620
- Oh, my god,
Richard's gonna kill himself.

17:21.724 --> 17:23.241
- He stole my idea.

17:23.344 --> 17:24.586
- Jake, we have to help him.

17:24.689 --> 17:26.206
- Ugh.
Fine.

17:27.172 --> 17:29.689
- Richard, question.

17:29.793 --> 17:32.000
Why are you doing this?

17:32.103 --> 17:34.241
- Because I don't have
any friends!

17:34.344 --> 17:37.275
So I go to birthday parties of
people I don't even know

17:37.379 --> 17:39.379
and binge eat to try to fill

17:39.482 --> 17:43.482
the bottomless void
of loneliness inside me.

17:43.586 --> 17:44.862
- Okay!

17:44.965 --> 17:45.793
Great.

17:45.896 --> 17:47.344
Thanks.

17:47.448 --> 17:48.586
- Thanks for
agreeing to help us, Baron.

17:48.689 --> 17:50.344
- I'm not doing this for you,
assholes.

17:50.448 --> 17:51.758
I'm doing this for Richard,

17:51.862 --> 17:52.896
because he gives me cake.

17:53.000 --> 17:54.241
So really
I'm doing it for me.

17:54.344 --> 17:55.379
- So here's what I think
you should tweet.

17:55.482 --> 17:56.793
- Stop.

17:56.896 --> 17:59.068
You wouldn't tell Shakespeare
how to write a sonnet,

17:59.172 --> 18:01.586
and you don't tell
a social media guru

18:01.689 --> 18:03.758
how to get a hashtag trending,
okay?

18:03.862 --> 18:05.758
So step back.

18:24.655 --> 18:26.241
It's beautiful.

18:38.413 --> 18:40.344
- It's in the Internet's hands
now.

18:42.586 --> 18:45.103
- Richard, I know
where you're coming from.

18:45.206 --> 18:47.241
I was wait-listed at Yale.

18:47.344 --> 18:48.689
But then I got in.

18:48.793 --> 18:50.620
- We have a plan.
Let us talk to Richard.

18:50.724 --> 18:53.275
- Give us a chance to prove
that we can be your tools.

18:53.379 --> 18:54.793
- That's actually
a really good idea.

18:54.896 --> 18:57.310
- When he jumps,
we'll just pin the blame on you.

18:59.379 --> 19:01.241
- Richard, don't do this.

19:01.344 --> 19:03.379
- Yeah, Richard,
don't jump or whatever.

19:03.482 --> 19:04.931
- Just stay back!

19:05.034 --> 19:06.344
I'm gonna kill myself.

19:06.448 --> 19:08.620
- Richard, we all want to
kill ourselves.

19:08.724 --> 19:09.620
- But you can't.

19:09.724 --> 19:11.551
Because the Internet
cares about you.

19:11.655 --> 19:13.275
The top trending hashtag
on twitter right now

19:13.379 --> 19:15.482
is "Save Richard."

19:15.586 --> 19:18.241
- Really?

19:18.344 --> 19:20.034
- It's actually second
under hashtag

19:20.137 --> 19:20.965
"You know you're single when."

19:21.068 --> 19:21.931
- Shut up.

19:22.034 --> 19:23.551
Richard,
all across the world,

19:23.655 --> 19:26.310
millions of faceless,
nameless strangers

19:26.413 --> 19:29.000
who will forget about you
tomorrow want you to live.

19:29.103 --> 19:31.068
They care about you,
Richard.

19:31.172 --> 19:33.310
Also we brought cake.

19:33.413 --> 19:34.551
- What kind of cake?

19:34.655 --> 19:37.206
- Richard,
shut up and come down!

19:37.310 --> 19:38.689
- Okay!

19:38.793 --> 19:40.034
I'm coming down!

19:40.137 --> 19:41.172
- Holy shit.

19:41.275 --> 19:42.620
Someone finally listened to me.

19:44.034 --> 19:45.206
- And then I personally
stepped in

19:45.310 --> 19:48.034
and saved one of our most
valued employees, Richard,

19:48.137 --> 19:50.896
who I'm happy to welcome back
to the Hampton DeVille family.

19:51.000 --> 19:53.379
And as a gesture of sympathy
for the victims

19:53.482 --> 19:56.413
of Hurricane Letisha,
who we love dearly,

19:56.517 --> 19:58.482
we will be offering
10% off the Obelisk

19:58.586 --> 20:00.379
to anyone who can prove

20:00.482 --> 20:03.103
their home was destroyed
in the hurricane.

20:03.206 --> 20:04.275
- Good news.

20:04.379 --> 20:06.068
We just got word
that this controversy

20:06.172 --> 20:07.620
increased brand awareness

20:07.724 --> 20:10.275
and boosted sales
of the Obelisk by 4%.

20:10.379 --> 20:11.896
- Great job, you two.

20:14.241 --> 20:16.344
- Well, Matt, you did it.
You saved Richard.

20:16.448 --> 20:17.482
- I didn't save him.

20:17.586 --> 20:19.103
All I did
was tell Baron to do it.

20:19.206 --> 20:22.034
- Matt, telling Baron to do it
was doing it.

20:22.137 --> 20:23.344
- Oh, my god.

20:23.448 --> 20:25.655
You're right.

20:25.758 --> 20:27.586
We saved Richard.

20:30.586 --> 20:32.206
- Wait about a week
for this to blow over

20:32.310 --> 20:33.689
and fire Richard again.

20:33.793 --> 20:37.448
I don't want that cake feaster
working here.

20:42.137 --> 20:43.517
- I'm sorry.

20:43.620 --> 20:46.310
It's my fault we broke up,
not yours.

20:46.413 --> 20:48.206
- You're a great guy.

20:48.310 --> 20:50.068
- Everyone likes you.

20:50.172 --> 20:52.241
- I made a mistake
by leaving you.

20:57.034 --> 20:58.896
- I'm sorry.
- I'm so sorry.

20:59.000 --> 21:00.172
- Oh, I'm sorry.

21:10.793 --> 21:12.068
- Can you give us a sense of
what the people

21:12.172 --> 21:13.793
in the path of the hurricane
are feeling right now?

21:13.896 --> 21:17.241
- Karen, it is absolute mayhem
down here.

21:17.344 --> 21:20.620
Everyone is really upset about
Hampton DeVille's tweet.

21:20.724 --> 21:23.068
It's all anyone can talk about.
