00:33.364 --> 00:36.369
So you've decided to make your own luck.

00:36.469 --> 00:37.938
I can understand that.

00:38.038 --> 00:42.893
I made Heineken into a world class brand.
Me. On my own.

00:43.243 --> 00:45.845
It's worth billions now.

00:45.945 --> 00:47.547
I did that.

00:47.647 --> 00:50.851
And not by sitting on my ass either
waiting for the stupid money fairy

00:50.951 --> 00:54.188
to hit me on my stupid damned head.

00:54.288 --> 00:58.024
You know that what you're doing
is completely stupid.

00:58.124 --> 01:02.330
Unless, of course, you pull it off,
in which case it can be completely brilliant.

01:02.430 --> 01:08.014
Yeah. I suppose if I were in your shoes,
I would do exactly the same.

01:48.341 --> 01:49.657
There he is.

01:52.645 --> 01:55.916
What are you doing? What are you doing?
What are you doing?

01:56.016 --> 01:59.669
- You can't bring a kid to this.
- He can wait outside with Brakes.

02:00.155 --> 02:01.569
This is fucked up.

02:02.589 --> 02:06.359
Listen, it's not fucked. It's fine.
Cat, can you put the kid down, please?

02:06.459 --> 02:08.261
Just give him to my little brother.

02:08.360 --> 02:10.097
- Right. Now, is everyone ready?
- Yes.

02:10.197 --> 02:11.846
- Is everyone ready?
- Yeah!

02:29.882 --> 02:32.550
Alright, let's do this.

02:35.353 --> 02:38.693
Well, it's a pleasure to finally meet you,
Mr. Iverson. My name is Cor Van Hout.

02:38.793 --> 02:41.011
This is Mr. Holleeder,
Mr. Boellard, and Mr. Meijer.

02:41.761 --> 02:44.414
We're here today in the hope
of asking you for a loan.

02:44.564 --> 02:45.966
- A loan?
- Yeah.

02:46.066 --> 02:47.360
It's a business loan.

02:47.460 --> 02:50.003
- And what particular sort of...?
- Construction.

02:50.103 --> 02:53.307
- Yeah, we were doing well.
- Yeah, really well.

02:53.407 --> 02:56.043
You've been running a company
employing a hundred men?

02:56.243 --> 02:59.963
Yeah, well, we were all equal partners,
yeah, right down the middle there.

03:00.213 --> 03:03.183
Mr. Boellard here is a master carpenter.
Mr. Meijer has a...

03:03.283 --> 03:06.371
If these numbers are real,
you're in fine shape.

03:07.028 --> 03:09.689
Surely, if you've been making
this kind of money,

03:09.789 --> 03:13.433
you must have investments
that you could stake as collateral?

03:13.533 --> 03:15.795
Well, we had...

03:15.895 --> 03:19.633
you know, cars, and we had boats
and we had some race horses but...

03:19.733 --> 03:21.761
Equities, bonds, pension funds?

03:22.669 --> 03:25.405
When the recession hit, we cashed in.

03:25.505 --> 03:28.909
- Because the cars, the boats, the horses?
- It's for paychecks. It's...

03:29.009 --> 03:31.411
for guys living from one Friday
to the next. You know.

03:31.511 --> 03:36.483
I think you can understand that
their kids can't live or eat off IOUs.

03:36.583 --> 03:39.819
I think, maybe, what you haven't heard,

03:39.919 --> 03:44.357
Mr. Big Manager, is that... there's a
world of hurt out there right now...

03:44.457 --> 03:46.611
Oh, believe me, I know.

03:49.663 --> 03:52.365
Well, we still got a building.

03:52.465 --> 03:55.752
- Great. What's the address?
- It's Leidsegracht.

03:55.852 --> 04:00.204
- Six six three.
- Hold on. Leidsegracht? The commune?

04:00.436 --> 04:03.476
Commune? It's a bunch of punks
that don't pay their rent.

04:03.576 --> 04:06.114
- It's hardly a fucking commune.
- Yes. Squatters.

04:06.214 --> 04:07.837
We're in the process of evictions.

04:07.937 --> 04:10.742
Yeah. Well, government says once they
change the locks, they've got rights.

04:10.842 --> 04:13.795
So that means lawyers.

04:14.220 --> 04:15.991
I do see your problem.

04:16.755 --> 04:19.207
But you're welcome back
when you solve it.

04:21.327 --> 04:24.222
Guys like him
don't lend money to guys like us.

04:24.322 --> 04:28.051
- We'll get the punks out of the building.
- Yeah. How are you going to do that?

04:28.201 --> 04:31.686
Yeah. I got an idea. Alright, listen.
You're going to love this.

04:38.610 --> 04:41.147
- It's time to go, boys!
- Hey, what's going on?

04:41.247 --> 04:43.581
- Time to go!
- Open up!

04:43.681 --> 04:46.303
Cat, get in through a window,
not the front door!

04:47.741 --> 04:49.681
Open up!

04:51.391 --> 04:52.707
Come on down!

04:54.827 --> 04:57.979
- You don't scare me!
- You stink! You fucking stink!

05:03.368 --> 05:05.105
Whoa!

05:05.205 --> 05:06.472
I'll come back for you.

05:06.572 --> 05:08.321
Get the fuck out!

05:10.410 --> 05:14.095
I'm coming! I'm fucking coming!

05:30.195 --> 05:33.644
- Oh, shit!
- Get out of here!

05:35.934 --> 05:37.251
Shit.

05:42.541 --> 05:44.225
Oh, shit!

05:48.581 --> 05:51.265
Get the fuck out of here.

05:55.287 --> 05:56.694
Oh, shit.

06:01.928 --> 06:04.431
You going to go?
Go and get the fuck out of here!

06:04.531 --> 06:07.799
Go on! Get the fuck out! Go on! Go, go!

06:08.400 --> 06:10.904
Now you're in trouble!
Now you're in trouble!

06:11.004 --> 06:12.351
Go! Go! Everyone out!

06:13.773 --> 06:15.034
Go, go, go!

06:17.644 --> 06:20.997
Hey, this is our building!
We own this place!

06:21.247 --> 06:22.952
Fuckface!

06:24.017 --> 06:27.086
Police! Police! Everybody go!

06:27.186 --> 06:29.349
You want to do this?

06:29.556 --> 06:32.792
No. No, I think I'll pass.

06:32.892 --> 06:34.827
Pussy.

06:34.927 --> 06:36.038
Hey!

06:38.464 --> 06:40.081
Charge!

06:41.549 --> 06:43.360
Take it easy! Take it easy!

06:48.471 --> 06:50.561
Get your fucking hands off of me now.

06:51.611 --> 06:54.614
I hope... well, fuck it.
Yeah, yeah. Okay.

06:54.714 --> 06:56.833
Fine. Thank you. Bye.

06:57.434 --> 06:58.752
What'd he say?

06:58.852 --> 07:00.119
Well, he said if we lived in Texas,

07:00.219 --> 07:03.339
they'd throw us a parade.
But here, well you know how that is.

07:03.489 --> 07:05.492
- Yeah.
- Anyway, good news.

07:05.592 --> 07:07.227
Squatters aren't going to press charges.

07:07.327 --> 07:09.129
- How kind is that?
- Whooptiedoo.

07:09.229 --> 07:11.231
- Happy days.
- Cornelius Van Hout.

07:11.331 --> 07:12.879
Yo.

07:14.800 --> 07:18.376
- Thank you.
- Only Van Hout.

07:20.540 --> 07:21.479
Hey.

07:21.579 --> 07:26.279
Bad news. You guys resisted arrest. Plus,
not only do they get to stay in the building,

07:26.379 --> 07:30.811
we got to pay for the shit we busted.
Yeah, including the fish!

07:31.217 --> 07:33.733
Fuck the fish.

07:44.296 --> 07:45.950
Sonja?

07:48.433 --> 07:50.082
Hey.

07:51.905 --> 07:55.124
No, no, no. Listen. I can explain.
I... Sonja, please, will...

07:55.574 --> 07:57.093
Son...!

07:57.943 --> 08:01.025
Sonja, what are you doing?

08:01.125 --> 08:03.049
You alright?

08:03.982 --> 08:06.000
What's going on, Son?

08:12.859 --> 08:16.062
What are you doing?
What are you doing hiding in my kitchen?

08:16.162 --> 08:19.199
Hey, who are you? Who are you?

08:19.299 --> 08:22.615
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know who you are.
I just worked it out.

08:23.203 --> 08:27.491
Yeah, that's right. You know what? You are
way too good-looking to be Karin's boy.

08:28.741 --> 08:32.879
Oh, hey, Karin, hey. Hey, how you doing?
I was just joking about...

08:32.979 --> 08:37.831
If you had any idea what's been going on
with Sonja, then you wouldn't do as you do.

08:40.820 --> 08:42.956
What do you mean "going on"?

08:43.056 --> 08:45.930
Sonja, please, wh... what's going on?

08:48.393 --> 08:50.279
I'm pregnant.

08:51.907 --> 08:53.856
What?

08:56.302 --> 09:00.800
That's... Really? That's unbelievable.

09:01.040 --> 09:02.842
- You're fucking pregnant? Really?
- Yes.

09:02.942 --> 09:05.145
- I'll leave you two to it then.
- Bye!

09:05.245 --> 09:07.730
See you, Karin! Hey, come on, you!

09:08.180 --> 09:10.249
Happy New Year!

09:10.349 --> 09:13.436
- Hey!
- Hey, Ma!

09:13.586 --> 09:15.947
Look at your hair and your dress,
you look like a model.

09:18.591 --> 09:19.607
Hey, be careful!

09:19.707 --> 09:22.526
- Yeah, your sister's knocked up.
- Yeah, I know It's great.

09:24.063 --> 09:27.100
He doesn't greet his old man
or even have a beer with him.

09:27.200 --> 09:32.131
- You know I don't drink. Especially Heineken.
- Look at me when you talk to me.

09:36.909 --> 09:41.894
Heineken beer and Heineken money paid
for this house and for your upbringing.

09:46.251 --> 09:48.288
You see that?

09:48.388 --> 09:50.256
The man is my friend.

09:50.356 --> 09:53.174
But he fired you and I don't think
he remembers your name.

10:06.972 --> 10:08.884
You owe him respect.

10:08.984 --> 10:13.029
- Okay, let's go.
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

10:13.179 --> 10:14.758
- Bye, honey.
- Happy New Year.

10:14.858 --> 10:17.032
Bye. Bye.

10:17.132 --> 10:19.569
- Take care of her.
- Thank you. Alright. Thank you.

10:20.151 --> 10:24.004
Invite him round next time, Pa.
We'll all kiss his ring.

10:34.099 --> 10:37.337
- Well, that was festive.
- Oh, come on. Let's have some fun.

10:37.437 --> 10:40.506
- Let's go to Karin's.
- Come on, Sonja.

10:40.606 --> 10:43.509
You know what we got to do.
Hey? Come on.

10:43.609 --> 10:45.692
I'll look after him. Come on.

10:45.792 --> 10:48.171
- Come on. It's tradition, alright?
- Yeah, go.

10:48.271 --> 10:49.651
- You don't mind?
- No!

10:49.751 --> 10:52.260
No? Alright, I love you.

10:52.360 --> 10:54.334
- Love you, too. Go!
- Have fun!

11:00.425 --> 11:03.167
Here's to making this year count.

11:03.796 --> 11:06.516
Alright, to getting our old lives back.

11:07.266 --> 11:11.104
Yeah, some fucking New Year.
We've no money, the company's bankrupt,

11:11.204 --> 11:13.306
and no one's going to give us a loan.

11:13.406 --> 11:15.908
So how are we going to get
our old lives back?

11:16.008 --> 11:18.612
- We could get jobs.
- Yeah, that's the alcohol talking.

11:18.712 --> 11:21.047
I'm not getting a real job.

11:21.147 --> 11:25.685
No, I'm not going to bust my ass every
single day to go absolutely nowhere.

11:25.785 --> 11:30.346
You know, I think this year
I refuse to be miserable.

11:31.991 --> 11:35.895
Actually, that's... that's why I want
to talk to you guys about some business.

11:35.995 --> 11:38.639
- Cor, we just got out of jail.
- I'm not talking about that kind of business.

11:38.739 --> 11:43.269
- I'm talking about smart business.
- So what type of business you planning?

11:43.369 --> 11:48.525
I'm planning something...
something organized, something big.

11:49.575 --> 11:51.223
How big?

11:51.911 --> 11:55.865
Big enough that we never have to grovel
to another asshole banker again.

11:56.015 --> 11:57.717
Yeah, right, man.

11:57.817 --> 12:00.086
We betting? Or we talking about a crime?

12:00.186 --> 12:04.373
That's all crime is.
It's like a... it's a wager.

12:04.823 --> 12:09.756
Right? Think about it.
You bet your liberty against the payoff.

12:10.229 --> 12:14.100
You know. All I have to bet,
all I have left... is my liberty.

12:14.200 --> 12:18.304
And that's all you guys have.
That's all you've got left to bet.

12:18.404 --> 12:20.457
So if you're going to bet that,

12:21.007 --> 12:23.173
I guess you're going to
have to bet it big.

12:23.676 --> 12:25.491
How big?

12:28.980 --> 12:30.064
Sixty million.

12:31.751 --> 12:34.954
Shit, man. Sixty?

12:35.054 --> 12:37.991
- Who are you going to kidnap?
- Kidnap? Come on, man.

12:38.091 --> 12:41.694
- Shit. Man, I thought you were serious.
- You're an idiot. You're an idiot.

12:41.794 --> 12:44.631
He's serious. He's been talking
about this since we were fucking kids!

12:44.731 --> 12:47.820
- I'm fucking serious.
- Grabbing anybody is easy.

12:48.601 --> 12:51.471
Collecting the ransom and getting away
with it is impossible.

12:51.571 --> 12:53.728
No, it's not. It's not impossible.

12:54.807 --> 12:58.408
- Who do you want to kidnap?
- Got to be a local.

13:00.346 --> 13:04.342
It's got to be a guy.
I'm not messing with women or children.

13:05.551 --> 13:08.468
He's got to be stinking fucking rich.

13:12.891 --> 13:15.197
You're out of your fucking mind.

13:22.467 --> 13:24.819
It's like I said...

13:25.038 --> 13:28.823
let's make this year count.

13:29.508 --> 13:32.125
Happy fucking New Year!

13:43.021 --> 13:44.590
Hi, there.

13:44.690 --> 13:48.327
Guys, look what I've got.

13:48.427 --> 13:51.212
Cat, this is specially for you.

13:51.931 --> 13:54.072
What are you doing?

13:54.172 --> 13:56.319
Who do I look like?

13:56.769 --> 13:57.766
What do you think?

13:57.866 --> 14:00.072
I don't know if I love these
or hate these.

14:00.172 --> 14:04.210
- They're scary? I look like Willem.
- No, you look like a fucking pervert.

14:04.310 --> 14:06.479
Where's Willem anyway?

14:06.879 --> 14:08.348
I'm not wearing a wig.

14:08.448 --> 14:12.218
We got to find a place so we can
hide him where no one's going to look.

14:12.318 --> 14:15.772
My workshed would be perfect but there's
an office full of bean counters next door.

14:15.922 --> 14:17.701
Guys, we can't just
dump him in the shed.

14:18.090 --> 14:22.133
No. But we could build
a room inside the shed.

14:22.428 --> 14:23.451
- That's good.
- It's perfect.

14:23.551 --> 14:26.232
I found a boat we can steal.

14:26.332 --> 14:30.086
- It's fucking fast.
- Was a boat on the list?

14:31.036 --> 14:32.805
- No.
- So why are we talking about a boat?

14:32.905 --> 14:35.074
I'm trying to think outside the box.
Come on.

14:35.174 --> 14:37.360
Yeah, well, don't.

14:39.345 --> 14:41.147
Guns are on that list. Right?

14:41.247 --> 14:43.149
Okay. Yes.

14:43.249 --> 14:45.518
World War II sten gun.
Now be careful with that, please.

14:45.618 --> 14:48.982
- World War II?
- Safety's a little edgy on that!

14:51.190 --> 14:53.459
Fuck, Spikes!

14:53.593 --> 14:54.794
Man...

14:54.894 --> 14:57.563
- What?
- Hear that?

14:57.663 --> 14:59.249
Shit.

15:03.502 --> 15:05.922
- We're good? We're good? We're good?
- Yeah, yeah.

15:06.472 --> 15:10.109
- Here I go.
- What the fuck?

15:10.209 --> 15:11.945
- It's okay.
- What was that?

15:12.045 --> 15:15.011
Yeah, it was just fucking Rambo
over here.

15:16.548 --> 15:19.151
Listen, man. Where have you been?

15:19.251 --> 15:22.465
I've been thinking about
how we grab Heiny.

15:22.565 --> 15:27.052
Oh, yeah? We've been trying to come up
with some ideas, too. What you got?

15:27.152 --> 15:28.654
If we're going to do this,

15:28.754 --> 15:32.448
we have to make sure that the cops
look in the wrong direction.

15:32.598 --> 15:35.768
That they have to believe
that whoever took Heiny...

15:35.868 --> 15:38.371
he's, like, some big swinging dick,

15:38.471 --> 15:43.349
like... Baader Meinhof?
Or Red Brigades? Mafia?

15:43.449 --> 15:46.479
And those fuckers
they don't mess around. Yeah?

15:46.579 --> 15:50.416
For a job like this, they would have
military grade weapons, radios.

15:50.516 --> 15:52.435
They would have a safehouse to hold him.

15:52.535 --> 15:56.389
They would have months of preparation,
months of observation.

15:56.489 --> 15:58.591
They would spend
at least a hundred grand.

15:58.691 --> 16:00.676
Same old story, man?

16:01.226 --> 16:05.731
Want to get rich?
You got to be rich already. Yeah.

16:05.831 --> 16:08.768
If you want to do this
on a shoestring, fine.

16:08.868 --> 16:11.537
But the cops are going to look for
a bunch of local jerkoffs

16:11.637 --> 16:13.492
and they're going to nail us
fucking flat.

16:16.108 --> 16:18.082
Oh, fuck it.

16:19.244 --> 16:22.129
Let's pay another visit to the bank.

16:24.449 --> 16:26.342
Remember...

16:26.891 --> 16:28.796
Shoot at the ground.

16:28.896 --> 16:30.782
We know.

16:31.923 --> 16:33.640
Okay, guys. Let's go.

16:44.302 --> 16:45.621
Now!

16:46.071 --> 16:47.788
- Now!
- On the ground!

16:53.978 --> 16:56.181
Go, go, go! Go, go, go!

16:56.281 --> 16:57.397
Come on!

16:58.883 --> 17:00.400
- Go! Go!
- Here we go!

17:06.723 --> 17:08.901
Put your gun down!

17:16.935 --> 17:18.887
Sorry!

17:19.038 --> 17:21.674
- Look out!
- He's gone to the next canal!

17:21.773 --> 17:23.656
That's it!

17:29.080 --> 17:32.466
Cat! Get ready to cut the rope!
Cut the rope!

17:35.620 --> 17:37.910
Go, go! I'll cover you!

17:50.635 --> 17:52.007
Come on! Hurry up!

17:58.676 --> 18:00.468
Come on!

18:01.280 --> 18:03.797
Shoot at the ground!
Shoot at the ground!

18:10.488 --> 18:12.439
Get down!

18:16.628 --> 18:17.904
Shit!

18:32.210 --> 18:34.261
- Get out of the way!
- Look out! Look out!

19:14.085 --> 19:16.636
- You sure it's clear?
- Yeah, yeah.

19:35.706 --> 19:37.680
Yeah, Cor.

19:43.149 --> 19:46.419
Now who's big swinging dicks?

19:46.519 --> 19:49.268
Alright, it's time
to get down to business.

19:54.993 --> 19:58.703
- How was your day?
- Yeah, it was fine. It was good.

19:59.264 --> 20:01.820
Somebody robbed a bank.

20:04.069 --> 20:06.838
Yeah, I know. I heard that.

20:06.938 --> 20:10.609
With machine guns, like, Al Capone.

20:10.709 --> 20:14.580
- They shot hundreds of bullets.
- Hardly. I don't think so.

20:14.680 --> 20:19.707
It was all over the radio. And the TV.
Where have you been?

20:22.121 --> 20:25.291
I was with Cat.
I was helping him with his boat.

20:25.391 --> 20:27.126
- Where?
- What do you mean "where"?

20:27.226 --> 20:31.213
At the marina. Up in Newlake.

20:32.364 --> 20:35.343
Does he ever pay you
for stuff like that?

20:36.301 --> 20:39.285
Yeah. Yeah, he does.

20:42.708 --> 20:45.461
Okay, okay. Nice.

20:52.584 --> 20:56.302
Amazing thing about that robbery.

20:57.289 --> 21:02.022
All that gunfire.
They didn't hit anyone.

21:05.430 --> 21:08.497
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

21:09.134 --> 21:11.273
Yeah, that's good.

21:37.862 --> 21:39.515
Thank you.

21:48.806 --> 21:51.790
I've been waiting for you, Obi-Wan.

21:54.345 --> 21:57.248
That's good, right? You know what?
I'm going to take that.

21:57.998 --> 22:00.298
How much do I owe you?

22:02.353 --> 22:06.472
Yeah. Yeah, I'm going to need a couple.

22:07.392 --> 22:10.129
May I ask you something?
You're not from around here.

22:10.229 --> 22:12.147
No, I'm just passing through.

22:12.297 --> 22:15.481
Here's my private telephone number.

22:15.768 --> 22:18.080
I can show you around.

22:24.308 --> 22:27.180
I weighed it.
Thirty five million is all we can carry.

22:27.280 --> 22:29.013
Maybe the wood blocks
that were heavier than the money.

22:29.113 --> 22:30.912
No, they're not. I checked.

22:33.651 --> 22:35.232
It'll all have to be
small denominations.

22:35.332 --> 22:37.356
- And different currencies.
- I've carried twice as much.

22:37.456 --> 22:39.812
- Oh, aren't you one?
- I already picked out my Ferrari.

22:39.912 --> 22:42.928
A Ferrari? Yeah?
You couldn't handle a Ferrari.

22:43.028 --> 22:44.664
- You can barely handle a scooter.
- Fuck you, man.

22:44.764 --> 22:48.381
- You want a Ferrari because you got a small dick.
- Fuck you, man.

23:18.429 --> 23:20.833
- I didn't hear anything.
- Yeah, well.

23:20.933 --> 23:22.864
I'm surprised.

23:24.269 --> 23:26.390
Well. Yeah.

23:27.172 --> 23:28.770
We have to test these as well.

23:33.110 --> 23:34.730
Cat?

23:35.413 --> 23:36.933
Cat?!

24:22.927 --> 24:24.463
Where is everything?

24:24.563 --> 24:28.200
What happened to the cells?
What's going on?

24:28.300 --> 24:29.985
What...? What's going on?

24:30.335 --> 24:32.572
Where is everything?

24:33.338 --> 24:36.555
I want you to think
of the Anne Frank house.

24:37.742 --> 24:40.004
Oh, yeah. Anne Frank!

24:40.478 --> 24:42.680
Fucking brilliant.

24:45.516 --> 24:46.785
You're a genius.

24:46.885 --> 24:49.388
- Come again.
- You're a fucking genius.

24:49.488 --> 24:52.996
- Where's the door?
- You ask and you shall receive.

24:54.793 --> 24:57.210
We did do a door, right?

25:00.765 --> 25:02.368
Good job.

25:02.468 --> 25:07.840
"Respond to our ransom demand
by the deadline

25:07.940 --> 25:11.409
"by running the code word 'Notice'

25:11.509 --> 25:16.462
"in the newspaper or you'll never see
Heineken or Doderer ever again."

25:19.184 --> 25:21.002
Okay.

25:21.152 --> 25:22.586
Take it.

25:38.602 --> 25:41.070
Can you fucking stop that?

25:50.347 --> 25:51.464
Okay, it's time.

26:35.926 --> 26:38.630
- Shit.
- No, it's nothing.

26:38.730 --> 26:42.601
- You don't know that.
- Look, it's nothing. It's just a coincidence.

26:42.701 --> 26:45.404
There's always an excuse
if you're looking for it.

26:45.504 --> 26:48.887
If we're going to do this, we do it now.

26:56.280 --> 26:57.296
Here we go.

27:01.752 --> 27:04.456
Alright, let's go.

27:04.556 --> 27:06.172
Let's go.

27:13.297 --> 27:17.817
Now remember, if we need to speak,
then we only speak in German.

27:37.789 --> 27:39.824
We'll be in touch.

27:43.761 --> 27:45.321
Alright.

27:50.529 --> 27:52.151
What's going on? What are you doing?

27:56.174 --> 27:57.817
Who are you?

27:59.911 --> 28:03.462
Let me go! Let me go!

28:10.321 --> 28:12.872
Dumb shit! Get into the fucking van!

28:26.904 --> 28:28.020
What?

29:53.190 --> 29:55.377
Alright, alright, alright.

30:09.441 --> 30:11.093
Okay.

30:14.579 --> 30:16.618
Alright, okay, okay, okay.

30:18.916 --> 30:21.286
Alright, let me have all their clothes.

30:21.386 --> 30:24.212
- Come on.
- That's nice. I'll get the barrel.

30:26.623 --> 30:29.828
- Hey, can we talk now?
- Yeah, we can talk. I told you to speak in German!

30:29.928 --> 30:32.745
- Your man didn't fight like mine.
- Enough!

30:40.738 --> 30:42.824
Alright, listen.

30:43.074 --> 30:49.030
Listen. Did anybody leave
their fingerprints on this ransom note?

30:49.914 --> 30:56.330
I'll ask again. Did anybody
touch this with their bare hands?

30:56.430 --> 30:58.172
- I may have.
- Oh, fuck.

30:59.391 --> 31:01.927
Alright. Is there anybody next door?

31:02.027 --> 31:04.829
- They should have left by now.
- Come with me. Come on.

31:04.929 --> 31:08.314
- Let's start.
- Willem, where do I start?

31:36.093 --> 31:37.986
The copier is there.

31:54.578 --> 31:57.235
Let's go. Let's go, let's go.

31:59.149 --> 32:01.208
It's okay. We got a new one.

32:03.854 --> 32:05.871
You got his watch?

32:14.498 --> 32:17.168
Alright. Now remember,

32:17.268 --> 32:20.571
once you're done with that,
you make out like it's any other night.

32:20.671 --> 32:22.981
- All right, we'll be at the bar.
- I'll be there.

32:23.081 --> 32:26.978
It's our alibi. Hey, kid. You good?

32:27.078 --> 32:29.962
Yeah? You sure? Alright, good.

32:35.619 --> 32:39.808
Just don't think about it
being a police station, alright?

32:40.158 --> 32:43.762
Ever think you'd deliver
an invoice for 35 million?

32:43.862 --> 32:47.772
- Are they really going to pay all that?
- They have to.

32:51.602 --> 32:53.865
Can't we just mail it?

32:54.539 --> 32:56.188
Come on.

32:58.041 --> 32:59.878
Take your breath.

32:59.978 --> 33:02.079
Breathe. Go.

33:20.432 --> 33:23.458
It's not exactly my favorite
neighborhood either.

33:39.149 --> 33:40.886
- Package is delivered, boys.
- You good?

33:40.986 --> 33:42.413
We're heading home.

33:42.513 --> 33:46.075
Cat, Cat, Cat. Stay for one minute.
Come on, stay for one.

33:47.125 --> 33:49.143
Yeah, one drink, one drink.

33:49.668 --> 33:51.836
You alright?

33:52.764 --> 33:54.716
Do it.

33:55.066 --> 33:56.601
Ring the bell!

33:56.701 --> 33:58.284
Ring it!

34:19.156 --> 34:22.393
- You guys do it up right last night?
- Well, you know me.

34:22.493 --> 34:24.862
We made sure we were seen
and we kept it respectable.

34:24.963 --> 34:26.664
- Good.
- You?

34:26.764 --> 34:30.163
Oh, it was riveting. I fell asleep
watching cartoons with the kids.

34:31.869 --> 34:33.440
Yeah.

34:40.409 --> 34:42.679
Well? How are they?

34:42.780 --> 34:45.295
Heineken's fine. Pissed off.

34:47.551 --> 34:49.868
The driver is not too good.

35:19.784 --> 35:21.959
Now you listen to me.

35:22.387 --> 35:25.640
You are in no danger here.

35:25.990 --> 35:30.000
As long as the money is paid,
you will be released. Do you understand?

35:35.832 --> 35:37.672
Hey, guys.

35:39.303 --> 35:40.954
Check it out.

36:20.144 --> 36:22.286
Do you have a name?

36:22.880 --> 36:24.120
No name.

36:24.615 --> 36:27.462
Is it ransom or money?

36:30.220 --> 36:31.883
Are you the boss?

36:33.057 --> 36:35.059
Okay, you're the boss.

36:35.159 --> 36:38.074
So, I have a few requests.

36:38.463 --> 36:42.500
I'd like a bathrobe, slippers,

36:42.600 --> 36:46.353
a shaving kit, comb, mirror,

36:47.637 --> 36:49.824
reading glasses,

36:50.897 --> 36:52.706
a decent fucking chair...

36:53.711 --> 36:59.064
and what else? Oh, yes, and if it's not
too much trouble, a telephone.

37:01.752 --> 37:04.006
You have no name?

37:05.022 --> 37:07.802
You're part of an organization?

37:08.326 --> 37:11.579
You're Baader Meinhof? Red Brigade?

37:11.729 --> 37:15.258
IRA? Symbionese Army?

37:20.737 --> 37:22.040
- Hey, Cor.
- What?

37:22.140 --> 37:24.675
- Look at this.
- What?

37:24.775 --> 37:26.244
- Oh, fuck.
- You're going to love it.

37:26.344 --> 37:29.147
Nice. Nice, nice.

37:29.247 --> 37:31.015
Says five guys involved.
How many have you?

37:31.115 --> 37:34.195
- This one says three.
- Yeah, listen to this. Listen.

37:34.419 --> 37:39.624
"An unknown number of most certainly
dangerous and experienced criminals."

37:39.724 --> 37:42.156
- Let me see, let me see.
- It's perfect.

37:42.256 --> 37:44.483
More about this morning's top story...

37:44.630 --> 37:47.332
Alfred Heineken,
the billionaire of brewing magnate,

37:47.432 --> 37:50.268
was kidnapped by a group of heavily
armed men yesterday...

37:50.368 --> 37:53.872
- I know who did it.
- Corporate in Amsterdam.

37:53.972 --> 37:55.940
Police have now confirmed that they...

37:56.040 --> 37:58.893
- Who?
- Bud.

37:59.443 --> 38:00.912
Weiser. Bud Weiser.

38:01.012 --> 38:04.025
Yeah? One way to beat the competition?

38:05.249 --> 38:07.614
Funny guy?

38:08.053 --> 38:11.489
Police would not disclose
the size of the ransom demanded

38:11.589 --> 38:13.972
but it is assumed to be significant.

38:16.026 --> 38:17.328
What?

38:17.428 --> 38:18.897
- The ransom note.
- What?

38:18.997 --> 38:20.398
- The ransom note.
- What do you mean?

38:20.498 --> 38:23.117
- Did we leave it? In the copier?
- No, no.

38:23.667 --> 38:27.071
...until he was threatened
by the kidnappers with a machine gun.

38:27.171 --> 38:30.604
Wait, did we...? No, did we?

38:33.009 --> 38:35.463
Oh, fuck.

38:54.766 --> 38:56.334
Hey...

38:56.434 --> 38:58.136
- George.
- George, yeah.

38:58.236 --> 38:59.437
- Remember me?
- Yeah.

38:59.537 --> 39:01.773
- How's it going?
- Same old, same old.

39:01.873 --> 39:04.275
- So everything's alright?
- I guess.

39:04.375 --> 39:06.790
Do you mind if we make a quick copy?
Me and the guys.

39:06.890 --> 39:08.346
- Go ahead.
- Thank you.

39:08.446 --> 39:10.119
Thank you.

39:42.145 --> 39:43.890
Thank you.

39:50.754 --> 39:52.590
Thank you for that, too.

39:52.690 --> 39:56.733
I assume you...
sent a note about the ransom.

39:56.833 --> 39:59.046
Did they reply?

39:59.296 --> 40:01.275
Well, they will.

40:05.970 --> 40:08.215
In the meantime, this music,

40:08.315 --> 40:12.417
it's beautiful and laden
with tragic disillusion, but...

40:12.767 --> 40:15.379
the same tape
over and over again, all day long,

40:15.479 --> 40:19.301
please, I know I am your prisoner but
there's no need to torture me, my friend.

40:20.251 --> 40:24.956
Some Johann Sebastian Bach
would be quite soothing. Or, well...

40:25.056 --> 40:29.560
Franz Fucking Schubert, anything.
Silence, preferably.

40:29.660 --> 40:31.996
Also, some books would pass the time

40:32.096 --> 40:35.350
and as much as I adore
ham sandwiches, my friend,

40:36.000 --> 40:38.846
Chinese food is quite easy to get,

40:38.946 --> 40:43.274
and it's cheap too, and... I know,
something like, let me think...

40:43.374 --> 40:45.493
yeah, Bang Bang chicken.

40:45.843 --> 40:49.161
With some extra chili sauce,
how about that? Okay?

40:55.185 --> 40:57.284
Happy birthday. Cheers.

40:58.790 --> 41:02.009
You'll be looking for
a regular paycheck now, hey.

41:02.624 --> 41:05.046
Finally. I can serve the cake now.

41:05.196 --> 41:06.981
Hi, honey.

41:07.131 --> 41:09.517
No more fooling around?

41:09.634 --> 41:12.270
- My son Mark, he drives a tram.
- Yeah, I know Mark.

41:12.370 --> 41:15.952
Yeah, he's got good hours.
Most importantly, he's got a good pension.

41:17.375 --> 41:20.432
- You'd have to take the training first.
- Really? They train?

41:20.532 --> 41:23.428
- I could have a word with him...
- Could you?

41:25.216 --> 41:28.088
Always the same stupid joke.

41:29.821 --> 41:32.223
From my daughter as well, now?
Wonderful.

41:32.323 --> 41:34.291
What a kind and thoughtful gift,
thank you.

41:34.391 --> 41:36.998
Pa, it was a joke.

41:37.995 --> 41:40.999
Cannot you at least wait
till they let Mr. Heineken go?

41:41.099 --> 41:43.471
- If they ever do let him go.
- Don't start on this again.

41:43.571 --> 41:47.606
If I get those filthy bastards,
I will kill them. Kill them!

41:47.839 --> 41:51.556
Willem, please, it's Pa's birthday.
Come on.

41:58.114 --> 42:02.273
Cat? How long do you reckon it'll take
Heineken's people to pay the ransom?

42:03.247 --> 42:04.773
Cat?

42:05.122 --> 42:08.574
- How long do you reckon it'll...?
- No more questions.

42:09.126 --> 42:11.110
Because I don't have the answers.

42:19.470 --> 42:22.240
Thanks.
Hey, and thanks for the new music.

42:22.340 --> 42:24.743
It's very whimsical, very droll.

42:24.843 --> 42:27.361
Yeah. Got books! Good.

42:27.611 --> 42:28.905
Alright.

42:29.880 --> 42:31.328
Any luck with the Bang Bang?

42:34.185 --> 42:35.757
No?

42:42.259 --> 42:44.779
Some guys like Bang Bang chili
all the time.

42:45.129 --> 42:48.299
But you like sweet sour.
Ever since five years.

42:48.399 --> 42:52.837
Sweet sour pork, sweet sour prawn,
sweet sour beef. You're a sweet sour guy.

42:52.937 --> 42:55.844
So it's Chinese, right?
Now me is a chili guy.

42:55.994 --> 42:59.825
Okay, okay. You a goddamn Bang Bang man.

43:03.447 --> 43:05.416
- Right.
- See you tomorrow.

43:05.516 --> 43:07.165
What can I get for you?

43:08.820 --> 43:10.417
Wake up.

43:10.667 --> 43:12.578
Fuck you, man.

43:14.825 --> 43:17.294
- Did they run the notice?
- Not yet.

43:17.394 --> 43:20.398
Come on, man, this was only
supposed to take five days.

43:20.498 --> 43:23.101
What if he is sick?
We gotta kidnap a fucking doctor?

43:23.201 --> 43:25.887
- Is he sick?
- No.

43:26.337 --> 43:29.922
Don't get too personal.
Or he'll get inside your head.

43:41.251 --> 43:45.222
Look, leather jacket, Popeye. Cops?

44:01.504 --> 44:06.009
Willem, even if they are cops,
it doesn't mean anything.

44:06.109 --> 44:09.046
- You okay?
- Fuck, I'm just done waiting.

44:09.146 --> 44:11.630
Yeah, I know. I know. Alright? Me, too.

44:22.960 --> 44:24.397
What are you trying to do?

44:30.367 --> 44:31.979
Yeah.

44:33.571 --> 44:37.474
If you tell the Police where I am,
I could give you half the ransom and...

44:37.574 --> 44:39.059
a house in Switzerland.

44:39.309 --> 44:43.214
Lots of beautiful Swiss girls,
blond, they're beautiful.

44:43.314 --> 44:45.279
I'll...

44:46.317 --> 44:49.025
I'll arrange it as many as you like.

44:49.920 --> 44:52.323
No? You're not interested?

44:52.423 --> 44:55.025
Are you gay or something?

44:55.125 --> 44:57.724
Any news from the Police?

45:09.539 --> 45:12.113
- It's been over two weeks now.
- The longer they don't pay the money,

45:12.213 --> 45:14.826
the more time they have
to figure out who did it.

45:16.679 --> 45:18.473
You want to give up?

45:19.216 --> 45:20.887
I do.

45:21.285 --> 45:23.237
You what?

45:23.387 --> 45:24.928
I do, yeah.

45:26.056 --> 45:28.059
Let's let him go.

45:28.659 --> 45:32.847
Knock down the cells, burn everything.

45:34.022 --> 45:36.317
Okay, we don't get the money,

45:36.867 --> 45:38.969
but you know what we do get?

45:39.069 --> 45:41.455
- Our lives back.
- Oh, come on.

45:41.805 --> 45:45.827
Come on, look, they're just messing
with us. That's all that is.

45:46.577 --> 45:49.346
Cat, where you going? Really? Cat...

45:49.446 --> 45:51.715
- Wait!
- We failed!

45:51.815 --> 45:54.578
It's my fucking shed. I want him
out of there. Before it's too late.

45:54.678 --> 45:58.489
Look, just listen! Just listen.
Listen, listen, alright?

45:58.589 --> 46:00.408
Look, it's all just part of the game.

46:01.158 --> 46:03.127
We're still in control here.

46:03.227 --> 46:07.827
You really want to walk out
on 35 million?

46:09.566 --> 46:12.841
What we got to do
is make the transaction.

46:13.370 --> 46:15.384
Thirty-five million.

46:20.243 --> 46:23.971
- Someone has got to relieve Brakes.
- Alright.

46:25.182 --> 46:27.131
I'm going home.

46:59.482 --> 47:01.609
They didn't pay.

47:02.052 --> 47:04.469
You've got to be kidding me.

47:04.922 --> 47:07.370
What do you mean they didn't pay?

47:07.958 --> 47:09.758
Last night was the deadline.

47:10.628 --> 47:14.598
We told them that we would kill you
if they didn't pay.

47:14.698 --> 47:16.467
And they didn't fucking pay!

47:16.567 --> 47:19.453
- So time's up!
- Okay.

47:19.803 --> 47:21.726
There must be some confusion.

47:23.440 --> 47:25.442
It's confusion, that's it.

47:27.511 --> 47:30.581
Damn, I'm their boss! Nobody else.

47:30.681 --> 47:33.784
Must be out of their fucking minds.
I'll fire them all!

47:33.884 --> 47:36.804
Give me a pen and paper.
Give me a pen and paper now!

47:36.954 --> 47:40.274
And you're all fired! You as well.
Don't worry, you'll get your blood money.

47:40.524 --> 47:43.819
You know you will. You have
my word of honor. Okay? Okay?!

47:44.361 --> 47:48.716
You fucking morons! Yeah.
What's his problem?

47:49.066 --> 47:51.185
- What?
- Now you listen to me.

47:51.735 --> 47:54.084
Can we also have your...

47:56.073 --> 48:00.945
Can we also have your word of honor
right now, in writing,

48:01.045 --> 48:05.015
that when you're free,
you won't help the police in any way?

48:05.115 --> 48:07.435
- My word of honor?
- Yeah.

48:07.885 --> 48:11.840
Yeah. That's the way the game is played.

48:13.123 --> 48:14.898
You've got my word.

48:15.693 --> 48:17.409
It's time to end it now, okay?

48:47.990 --> 48:49.574
Hello?

48:52.462 --> 48:54.798
Why is the door open? Hello?

48:54.898 --> 48:56.693
Ab, is that you?

48:58.936 --> 48:59.919
- Boss?
- Yeah.

49:00.019 --> 49:02.372
- Boss, are you alright?
- Yeah, I'm sort of okay.

49:02.472 --> 49:04.608
Tired of this crap.

49:04.708 --> 49:06.506
Oh, God.

49:07.244 --> 49:10.447
Are you okay? Have they left you alone
or given you a rough time?

49:10.547 --> 49:14.585
I don't know, I... I... I...
How long have we been in here now?

49:14.685 --> 49:18.656
A month? I don't know, I've lost track.
I'm a little confused, it feels longer.

49:18.756 --> 49:20.641
Now, now, I'll tell you now.

49:21.625 --> 49:22.819
It comes to...

49:24.528 --> 49:27.165
Almost three weeks.

49:27.463 --> 49:29.082
Yeah.

49:29.900 --> 49:34.234
Why the hell are you here?
You've got no money to offer these jokers.

49:34.334 --> 49:35.806
Well, if...

49:35.906 --> 49:38.876
If your people don't pay,

49:38.976 --> 49:44.548
then... then these guys need to prove
that they're not fooling around and...

49:44.648 --> 49:49.730
Well, it can't be your head...
they'll send to the police in a box.

49:50.788 --> 49:53.876
Don't worry, Ab.
We'll... pay whatever it takes.

49:53.976 --> 49:56.327
If it's a hundred million, we'll pay.

49:56.427 --> 49:59.046
I want to get out of this
as much as you guys.

49:59.296 --> 50:02.700
Alright? But we have to let them
sweat it out another week.

50:02.800 --> 50:06.203
Let them believe that
their screw-up killed Heineken.

50:06.303 --> 50:09.423
You remind me again
why we grabbed the driver.

50:10.073 --> 50:14.570
- Why? What's your point?
- A question the police are asking.

50:14.670 --> 50:17.848
Is... are these guys the real deal?

50:17.948 --> 50:21.130
Or are they just a bunch of pussies?

50:21.518 --> 50:25.405
And if the answer is
that they're a bunch of pussies,

50:27.424 --> 50:30.845
- they're going to string this out forever.
- So what are you trying to say?

50:31.995 --> 50:35.065
Well, we said if they don't pay,
then there'll be blood.

50:35.165 --> 50:37.601
You wrote that in the letter.

50:39.469 --> 50:40.696
This is business.

50:42.272 --> 50:44.594
It's nothing personal.

50:45.375 --> 50:47.384
And they didn't fucking pay.

50:51.849 --> 50:54.698
- I agree.
- Oh, really?

50:56.185 --> 50:58.121
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

50:58.221 --> 50:59.523
- Yeah? You agree?
- Yeah.

50:59.623 --> 51:02.659
With him? Alright, good. Big man,

51:02.759 --> 51:05.531
alright then, slice his fucking throat.

51:23.746 --> 51:25.539
I'll do it.

51:38.527 --> 51:39.723
Willem...

51:40.705 --> 51:42.499
Hey. Hey. Hey.

51:42.599 --> 51:45.586
- You're acting like a scared little boy.
- Hey, you fucking do it!

51:45.936 --> 51:48.527
A scared little boy.

51:51.064 --> 51:53.644
Fuck! I didn't sign up for this!

51:53.744 --> 51:57.548
Cor, if he does anything... anything!

51:57.648 --> 52:01.368
If he does anything in there,
it's fucking on you.

52:01.518 --> 52:04.812
- Do something!
- Fuck.

52:11.461 --> 52:12.829
Use your head!

52:12.929 --> 52:14.824
Oh, fuck.

52:21.838 --> 52:23.624
Oh, fuck.

53:10.119 --> 53:12.121
You alright?

53:12.722 --> 53:15.859
Stop what you're doing.
What are you doing?

53:15.959 --> 53:18.125
What are you doing?

53:18.762 --> 53:23.147
What are you doing?
Come here. Come on. Come on.

53:39.048 --> 53:42.248
- Is he alright?
- Yeah, no, he's okay. He's fine.

53:43.487 --> 53:44.991
We all just need to go home,

53:45.856 --> 53:50.093
take a breather, get drunk,
get laid, whatever you got to do.

53:50.193 --> 53:54.080
But we just got to stick to the routine
and we'll see each other in a few days.

53:55.098 --> 53:57.971
Alright. Let's go.

54:10.112 --> 54:12.981
In a case that has riveted
the nation and much of Europe,

54:13.081 --> 54:17.921
the kidnapping of billionaire
Alfred Heineken has entered its 19th day.

54:18.021 --> 54:20.457
With no substantial leads
and no end in sight,

54:20.557 --> 54:24.442
a massive manhunt involving local
and federal law enforcement continues.

54:32.502 --> 54:35.175
Oh, hey. Where've you been?

54:36.473 --> 54:40.944
- You were supposed to be at birth class.
- What? No, s... Fuck.

54:41.044 --> 54:43.029
No, no, no.

54:43.279 --> 54:46.583
Sonja! Listen, I'm sorry.
Listen, I'll make it up to you!

54:46.683 --> 54:50.202
Alright? I'll make it up to you.
Sonja...

55:04.466 --> 55:07.618
Have they paid? Am I to be set free?

55:29.692 --> 55:32.325
Did you give them my message?

55:32.496 --> 55:36.750
You know, they have one more chance.

55:37.000 --> 55:39.386
If they screw it up this time...

55:39.536 --> 55:43.090
And they know I've given you my word
so they will pay, so...

55:43.840 --> 55:46.493
How are you planning to set us free?

55:46.643 --> 55:48.597
I will put...

55:48.697 --> 55:52.582
put the both of you in a car,
and... leave it somewhere.

55:52.682 --> 55:55.884
- Call your people.
- Oh, good.

55:56.953 --> 56:01.358
Listen, if your people don't pay soon,
then I can't answer for my people.

56:01.458 --> 56:05.329
I'll tell you what. If you put us
in that car right now, I'll...

56:05.429 --> 56:07.531
see to it that you get
what you want and...

56:07.631 --> 56:10.834
I'll make sure you're free to spend it.

56:10.934 --> 56:13.513
That's a promise and I have
the power to do that.

56:14.037 --> 56:15.760
You know?

56:16.573 --> 56:18.521
Of course.

56:19.243 --> 56:21.711
You're a young man and I must confess,
I do envy you.

56:21.811 --> 56:24.662
There's no way
you could have done this without...

56:26.082 --> 56:28.485
No way you could have done it
without those men in your life

56:28.585 --> 56:32.300
that you trust with your life. Friends.

56:33.356 --> 56:35.947
So congratulations, well done, and...

56:37.427 --> 56:40.989
soon you'll get your money
and then you will be...

56:41.539 --> 56:44.766
very, very rich.

56:45.435 --> 56:47.020
But...

56:47.970 --> 56:49.706
But what?

56:49.806 --> 56:53.525
No, what I meant to say,
my friend, is that...

56:53.810 --> 56:58.695
There are two ways a man can be rich
in this world. He can have a lot of money

56:59.249 --> 57:02.440
or he can have a lot of friends.

57:03.019 --> 57:05.474
But he cannot have both.

57:26.341 --> 57:28.289
Cor?

57:29.512 --> 57:30.947
Yeah?

57:31.047 --> 57:33.252
Rub my back?

57:34.416 --> 57:37.001
- Please?
- Yeah, yeah, I will later.

57:38.086 --> 57:39.203
Yes.

57:42.724 --> 57:45.870
Listen, I... I gotta go.

57:46.897 --> 57:49.983
They put the notice
we requested in the newspaper.

57:50.363 --> 57:51.968
Yeah?

57:52.068 --> 57:54.536
They're ready to pay.

57:55.772 --> 57:57.524
Good.

58:01.743 --> 58:04.268
What's this? Proof of life photo?

58:06.148 --> 58:09.666
Can I just comb my hair a bit? No?

58:10.220 --> 58:11.396
No.

58:11.496 --> 58:13.671
He's looking too relaxed.

58:22.498 --> 58:25.216
Leave my damn hair alone!

58:31.574 --> 58:34.332
Please, please, don't hurt me.

58:36.111 --> 58:37.749
Read.

58:45.521 --> 58:47.138
Read aloud, you idiot.

58:49.492 --> 58:51.695
"Eagle's instructions for the Mouse.

58:51.795 --> 58:56.154
"Paint a large white X on the orange van
used for the kidnapping.

58:56.533 --> 58:59.102
"Depart ten minutes after this call.

58:59.202 --> 59:02.854
"If anyone follows it will be
the end of the hostages.

"The next message for the Mouse,

59:28.932 --> 59:32.832
he will drive to Hotel Totenhoff."

59:33.269 --> 59:34.867
There it is.

59:35.617 --> 59:38.787
"By the lamppost
outside the main entrance

59:38.887 --> 59:43.027
you will find a plastic jar
with further instructions."

59:49.618 --> 59:51.555
Officer Hendricks for Headquarters.

59:51.655 --> 59:54.691
The next place would be
the gas station in Jahr.

59:54.791 --> 59:58.578
Alright. Last call. Come on.

59:58.828 --> 01:00:00.852
- Come on.
- Alright.

01:00:10.205 --> 01:00:13.801
- Yes, this is the Mouse.

01:00:59.488 --> 01:01:01.539
Spikes, one kilometer ahead.

01:01:04.960 --> 01:01:06.123
Driver, slow down.

01:01:08.332 --> 01:01:11.824
You stop at three orange cones
by the side of the road.

01:01:16.705 --> 01:01:18.458
Listen up, Mouse...

01:01:19.008 --> 01:01:23.059
Drop the money off the bridge
on your left.

01:01:42.731 --> 01:01:45.648
Driver. Leave now.

01:01:48.136 --> 01:01:50.280
Let's go, let's go!

01:01:50.739 --> 01:01:51.622
Come on!

01:02:03.885 --> 01:02:05.953
- I'll get rid of the car.
- Yeah, that's good.

01:02:06.053 --> 01:02:07.787
- We'll see you later.
- See you at the flat.

01:02:07.887 --> 01:02:10.310
Have a nice bike ride back.

01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:12.458
That's good. Come on.

01:02:26.942 --> 01:02:28.761
Freezing.

01:02:29.011 --> 01:02:30.762
Yeah, it's cold.

01:02:31.012 --> 01:02:32.630
But I don't care.

01:02:43.861 --> 01:02:45.323
- Police!
- Open up!

01:02:45.423 --> 01:02:46.897
- Open the door!
- Police!

01:02:46.997 --> 01:02:48.712
Now! Open the door!

01:02:51.734 --> 01:02:54.985
You're a fucking idiot! Did we do it?

01:03:02.444 --> 01:03:05.758
- Heiny. We got to go get Heiny.
- You owe me a fucking beer.

01:03:06.381 --> 01:03:07.484
You know I'm right.

01:03:07.584 --> 01:03:10.553
No, no, he's right, he's right.
Wait, wait, wait. Guys, okay.

01:03:10.653 --> 01:03:14.891
We got to finish the job. Let's drive
to the shed and we'll let Heineken go.

01:03:14.991 --> 01:03:16.275
- And I like it!
- Let's do it!

01:03:16.375 --> 01:03:20.563
Police say the ransom was larger
than any paid in modern times.

01:03:20.663 --> 01:03:24.351
So far no arrests have been made
and no suspects have been identified.

01:03:24.573 --> 01:03:26.919
- Let's chase some girls.
- An unidentified police source

01:03:27.019 --> 01:03:30.173
said that the kidnappers were likely
an established organization,

01:03:30.273 --> 01:03:34.560
well funded, highly disciplined
and almost certainly foreign.

01:03:35.249 --> 01:03:38.381
No lunch, no dinner, no lunch... No!
No breakfast, no dinner, no lunch...

01:03:38.481 --> 01:03:41.051
No lunch again... they...

01:03:41.151 --> 01:03:44.071
They've done the deal. That's why we...

01:03:44.621 --> 01:03:46.736
someone big, we've...

01:03:46.990 --> 01:03:48.975
Shit, something big!

01:03:49.525 --> 01:03:51.213
Big!

01:03:54.630 --> 01:03:56.980
Something big

01:03:57.600 --> 01:03:59.765
must have happened.

01:04:00.702 --> 01:04:02.253
Ab?

01:04:03.439 --> 01:04:06.083
Hey, Ab, have you saved some water?

01:04:07.209 --> 01:04:09.512
I've got four liters of water here.

01:04:09.612 --> 01:04:12.515
A man can last about a month on four...

01:04:12.615 --> 01:04:14.469
four liters...

01:04:30.198 --> 01:04:33.380
"Meticulous planning",
that's you, buddy.

01:04:41.043 --> 01:04:42.712
Behind us.

01:04:42.812 --> 01:04:44.643
- Behind us.
- Wait, what's going on?

01:04:48.118 --> 01:04:50.534
- What are you doing?
- We're being followed.

01:04:52.254 --> 01:04:54.807
- Have a look.
- It's the police.

01:04:55.250 --> 01:04:57.226
- Those are the cops from the bar.
- Yeah, I see them.

01:04:57.326 --> 01:04:58.229
Shit!

01:04:59.195 --> 01:05:00.996
This is the wrong way!

01:05:02.532 --> 01:05:05.483
- I'm going to try and lose them.
- Shit.

01:05:13.408 --> 01:05:17.743
We almost got hit.
He turned off. Turn left! Turn left!

01:05:33.762 --> 01:05:34.961
Shit.

01:05:35.565 --> 01:05:37.935
What do we do? What are we going to do?

01:05:38.035 --> 01:05:42.504
Right now they don't know where the money is.
So, Cor, how long we got before they do?

01:05:42.739 --> 01:05:44.007
- Come on. Let's go!
- Where?

01:05:44.107 --> 01:05:47.547
- We'll have to dig up the money!
- All five of us? In this car?

01:05:47.647 --> 01:05:49.412
- Yeah!
- Yeah? And then what? Then what?

01:05:49.512 --> 01:05:51.581
Well, I don't know!

01:05:53.882 --> 01:05:56.919
What do you got?
What have you got? Come on, think.

01:05:57.019 --> 01:05:59.953
- Alright, I think...
- Come on, come on!

01:06:00.053 --> 01:06:02.258
Alright! I think me and Willem go
and we get the money.

01:06:02.358 --> 01:06:04.694
The five of us can't stay in this car...

01:06:04.794 --> 01:06:07.766
so Willem and I are going to ditch the car
and then we dig up the money.

01:06:07.866 --> 01:06:11.034
Alright? Then I think what,
we meet you guys in three, four hours?

01:06:11.134 --> 01:06:13.887
- The boatyard. Out at Newlake.
- That's good, that's good.

01:06:13.987 --> 01:06:17.329
- In the meantime, I'm going to let Heineken go.
- No, we can't be worrying about Heineken.

01:06:17.429 --> 01:06:19.498
- I'm worried about him.
- There's no point in worrying about him now.

01:06:19.598 --> 01:06:21.692
Fucking go! Go!

01:06:26.081 --> 01:06:27.417
- Where are you doing?
- I'm coming with you.

01:06:27.517 --> 01:06:29.652
Better get out before
I break your fucking neck.

01:06:29.752 --> 01:06:31.587
- Just be careful.
- Don't go home. Promise me.

01:06:31.687 --> 01:06:33.156
Okay.

01:06:34.624 --> 01:06:36.659
Fuck you.

01:06:48.737 --> 01:06:50.657
What's the time?

01:06:50.907 --> 01:06:53.023
- What's the time?
- It's ten past.

01:06:56.978 --> 01:06:58.444
They're not here.

01:06:59.448 --> 01:07:01.776
They are not here.

01:07:02.785 --> 01:07:06.172
- They took all our money.
- Did you knock on the door?

01:07:06.422 --> 01:07:09.097
No, I didn't fucking knock on the door.

01:07:09.492 --> 01:07:12.122
Why should I knock on the door?
Where are their cars?

01:07:17.298 --> 01:07:19.310
They're not here.

01:07:21.636 --> 01:07:24.220
- Hey.
- Hey, come in.

01:07:29.978 --> 01:07:33.063
- Yeah, what's wrong with him?
- What's right with him?

01:07:47.929 --> 01:07:49.465
Here.

01:07:49.565 --> 01:07:51.935
- Shit, that's way too much.
- Now come on, you deserve it.

01:07:52.035 --> 01:07:55.151
Here, come here. I want to talk to you.

01:07:58.907 --> 01:08:00.693
What's up?

01:08:00.943 --> 01:08:05.348
I want you to take this money and I want you
to hide it in the next 20 minutes.

01:08:05.448 --> 01:08:07.983
- Yeah, but I'll come with you, right?
- No.

01:08:08.083 --> 01:08:09.819
What do you mean?

01:08:09.919 --> 01:08:13.066
Listen, you'll be fine.

01:08:13.166 --> 01:08:16.658
Look, I love you. Which means
I want what's best for you.

01:08:16.759 --> 01:08:20.145
Now you listen to what
I've got to say. Alright?

01:08:20.395 --> 01:08:24.625
Okay, good. You'll be fine.
Listen, you take this,

01:08:25.667 --> 01:08:30.540
and you make life work for you, alright?
Go on. Go on, get the fuck out of here!

01:08:30.640 --> 01:08:32.375
- You'll find me, yeah?
- Yeah, of course.

01:08:32.475 --> 01:08:34.671
- You promise?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:08:44.553 --> 01:08:46.798
Brakes is right.

01:08:46.988 --> 01:08:48.608
About what?

01:08:49.425 --> 01:08:53.301
- Money's too heavy.
- We had to leave a sack in that drum.

01:08:54.263 --> 01:08:56.408
- You did what?
- Oh, come on. You didn't even notice.

01:08:56.509 --> 01:08:58.885
Look at this, look!
You didn't even notice!

01:08:58.984 --> 01:09:01.697
You left it in the ground?
Seven fucking million?

01:09:01.796 --> 01:09:04.600
- Yeah, we'll get the rest when we come back.
- Come back?

01:09:04.701 --> 01:09:07.865
I have a friend, they live in Paris.
We're going...

01:09:07.965 --> 01:09:12.598
We're going to stay there
until everything's calmed down.

01:09:12.782 --> 01:09:14.934
Well, I can't.

01:09:15.184 --> 01:09:16.886
What do you mean?

01:09:16.986 --> 01:09:19.005
I can't stay in fucking Paris.

01:09:19.755 --> 01:09:23.805
Cor, I got a family. I got kids.

01:09:27.562 --> 01:09:29.198
What about Mr. Heineken?

01:09:29.298 --> 01:09:32.005
- Mr. Heineken!
- Answer me!

01:09:32.255 --> 01:09:34.837
You let Heineken out now
they will grab you, man.

01:09:34.937 --> 01:09:37.073
If we don't, he'll fucking die.

01:09:37.173 --> 01:09:41.477
Well, once we get to Paris,
we can call his people, tip them off.

01:09:41.577 --> 01:09:43.645
If they find him in Cat's shed,
then we can't ever go back.

01:09:43.746 --> 01:09:46.770
- Think about that? Come on, think about it!
- Jesus! Jesus, man!

01:09:46.871 --> 01:09:49.185
You leave half your brain out
in that hole with the rest of my money?

01:09:49.285 --> 01:09:52.087
- It's safe, alright? It's fucking safe!
- It'll never be safe.

01:09:52.188 --> 01:09:54.557
- It's safe!
- No!

01:09:54.657 --> 01:09:56.692
Don't you get it, Cor?

01:09:56.792 --> 01:10:00.480
It's never be safe. Not here.
Not in Paris.

01:10:00.730 --> 01:10:03.266
We're lucky if we can
hang out in Timbuktu.

01:10:03.366 --> 01:10:06.211
Take your fucking money.
Take it. Take it!

01:10:06.311 --> 01:10:09.118
We were worth a lot more than that.

01:10:12.040 --> 01:10:14.254
I'll see you on the outside.

01:10:26.940 --> 01:10:28.131
What about you?

01:10:29.425 --> 01:10:32.509
- Coming with us?
- Yeah, I'll come.

01:10:52.348 --> 01:10:53.964
Shit.

01:11:10.732 --> 01:11:11.948
Halt!

01:12:05.720 --> 01:12:08.707
Can you hear me, Ab? Wherever you are.

01:12:09.762 --> 01:12:11.575
Come on, John.

01:12:11.675 --> 01:12:15.478
Sing with me,
get your mind off all this rubbish.

01:12:15.998 --> 01:12:18.420
Any song, what is it?

01:12:43.691 --> 01:12:46.229
Are you the police?
What the hell took you so long?

01:12:46.329 --> 01:12:48.799
I'm alright. Just my friend, Ab,
my chauffeur, go and get him, please.

01:12:48.899 --> 01:12:51.389
That's it, go and get him!
Ab, it's over!

01:12:51.489 --> 01:12:54.521
He's in there! Go on.
Ab, you okay? It's over!

01:12:55.471 --> 01:13:00.156
It's over!
Jesus Christ, it's over! Oh, God!

01:13:04.613 --> 01:13:06.330
Fuck.

01:13:08.150 --> 01:13:10.791
Oh, thank you, God.

01:13:11.854 --> 01:13:13.737
Ab, you...

01:13:20.896 --> 01:13:22.497
Thank you, God.

01:13:22.597 --> 01:13:25.663
Kidnapped billionaire, Alfred Heineken,
has been rescued

01:13:25.763 --> 01:13:28.337
in a police raid earlier this evening.

01:13:28.437 --> 01:13:31.240
Both Heineken and his driver,
Ab Doderer,

01:13:31.340 --> 01:13:34.977
were found in a shed
in the outskirts of Amsterdam.

01:13:35.077 --> 01:13:37.781
- They were apparently unharmed...
- I don't know.

01:13:37.881 --> 01:13:40.633
Maybe it was the ransom note
we left in the copier.

01:13:40.783 --> 01:13:43.932
Or all that Bang Bang chicken
or maybe...

01:13:46.387 --> 01:13:49.496
Listen, I'm not saying he did, but...

01:13:50.459 --> 01:13:52.695
maybe Brakes
could have said something...

01:13:52.795 --> 01:13:54.463
Wait, wait, wait. What did you say?

01:13:54.563 --> 01:13:56.699
I'm not saying Brakes did,
I'm just saying...

01:13:56.799 --> 01:13:58.968
Yeah, no, no, I hear what you're saying.

01:13:59.068 --> 01:14:02.687
Maybe you all thought he was fucking you,
did you think about that?

01:14:07.575 --> 01:14:10.596
- Fuck. These are horse blankets.
- So? So what?

01:14:10.946 --> 01:14:14.049
I'm allergic. I stop breathing.

01:14:14.149 --> 01:14:16.085
You promise?

01:14:16.185 --> 01:14:18.329
I'm sick of you complaining!

01:14:19.555 --> 01:14:23.303
Alright, just calm down! Calm down!

01:14:24.593 --> 01:14:26.542
What the fuck?

01:14:32.401 --> 01:14:35.371
Just fucking stop it!

01:14:35.471 --> 01:14:37.481
Look, just stop it...!

01:14:39.808 --> 01:14:43.345
Get out of my car!
Just take it easy! Take it easy!

01:14:43.445 --> 01:14:45.903
Hold it together! Listen.
This fucking car...!

01:14:46.003 --> 01:14:49.919
- Look, just hold it together!
- You want your money? Take your money.

01:14:50.019 --> 01:14:53.455
Calm the fuck down. We haven't got time
for this shit! You, get in the car.

01:14:53.555 --> 01:14:56.159
- Get in the fucking car.
- No way. Not me! I'm out of here!

01:14:56.259 --> 01:14:58.220
- Spikes, get in the fucking car.
- Let him go.

01:14:58.320 --> 01:14:59.639
- Spikes.
- Fuck him. Come on.

01:14:59.739 --> 01:15:02.197
- Can't even pick up his bag.
- Spikes. Spikes!

01:15:02.297 --> 01:15:04.066
Come on, Cor.

01:15:04.166 --> 01:15:07.536
Look, Spikes! You're not going
to make two fucking miles!

01:15:07.636 --> 01:15:10.272
I'll make 10,000.

01:15:10.372 --> 01:15:11.713
Come on, Cor. Come with me.

01:15:11.813 --> 01:15:13.909
- What are you doing?
- Let him have the car.

01:15:14.009 --> 01:15:17.413
You're not going to make it without us.
Just get in the car, alright?

01:15:17.513 --> 01:15:19.667
You stay with that asshole,
he's gonna get you killed.

01:15:30.591 --> 01:15:32.712
Come on, Spikes!

01:15:33.562 --> 01:15:36.365
Look, Spikes!

01:15:36.465 --> 01:15:39.991
Oh, fuck it.

01:16:54.889 --> 01:16:56.776
Fuck!

01:17:56.838 --> 01:17:58.817
Okay, bye.

01:17:59.308 --> 01:18:01.377
This evening.
She's going to meet us this evening.

01:18:01.477 --> 01:18:03.460
Are you sure she's cool?

01:18:04.179 --> 01:18:05.850
She's cool.

01:18:10.852 --> 01:18:14.256
- Listen, I think I'm going to call Sonja.
- You leave my sister out of this.

01:18:14.356 --> 01:18:16.643
- Look, I won't be long.
- Wait.

01:18:17.693 --> 01:18:20.663
No, I'm serious. You put her in this shit
and they're going to know where we are.

01:18:20.763 --> 01:18:23.093
I've got to make sure she's all right.

01:18:24.633 --> 01:18:27.972
Alright, fine. Well,

01:18:28.222 --> 01:18:31.440
you make the call... I'm out of here.

01:18:31.807 --> 01:18:33.773
Seriously, you're on your own.

01:18:39.513 --> 01:18:42.865
Alright. Come on. Let's go.

01:18:44.585 --> 01:18:48.347
- What's this place like, anyway?
- It's... it's nice.

01:18:48.447 --> 01:18:51.939
But it's safe. That's all that matters.

01:19:00.502 --> 01:19:03.786
- Forget about it. Come back!
- I'm coming.

01:19:06.207 --> 01:19:07.943
- Hi.
- Hey.

01:19:08.043 --> 01:19:09.259
I'm going to make some coffee.

01:19:19.520 --> 01:19:20.737
What's going on?

01:19:25.393 --> 01:19:27.009
Front page.

01:19:28.729 --> 01:19:31.093
Spikes turned himself in.

01:19:31.934 --> 01:19:33.909
"God told me to burn the money."

01:19:35.592 --> 01:19:37.882
- He's insane.
- Or he's smart.

01:19:40.542 --> 01:19:43.362
He's going to do 15 years at least.

01:19:43.612 --> 01:19:45.731
Well, that's one way to play it.

01:19:46.757 --> 01:19:49.068
You think you could play it like that?

01:19:49.918 --> 01:19:52.856
No, God doesn't talk to me that much.

01:19:56.358 --> 01:19:59.075
Oh, yeah. He looks like an idiot.

01:20:00.896 --> 01:20:03.560
Mr. Heineken, it's been over two months
since you were released.

01:20:03.660 --> 01:20:05.935
Looking back,
what was your biggest fear?

01:20:06.035 --> 01:20:09.738
My biggest fear was
for my driver, Ab Doderer.

01:20:09.838 --> 01:20:12.524
Because he suffered most and...

01:20:12.674 --> 01:20:16.678
we both knew who was really expendable.

01:20:16.778 --> 01:20:19.381
Did they ever threaten to kill you?

01:20:19.481 --> 01:20:23.252
I honestly believe that they believed
it was a business deal, nothing more.

01:20:23.352 --> 01:20:26.421
And where do you think Cor Van Hout
and Willem Holleeder are now?

01:20:26.521 --> 01:20:31.360
It doesn't matter. As the great fighter
Joe Louis used to say,

01:20:31.460 --> 01:20:34.977
"You can run but you cannot hide."

01:20:35.930 --> 01:20:38.603
- We'll get them.
- Thank you.

01:20:43.771 --> 01:20:46.323
- I'm going to have to phone Sonja.
- You can't do that.

01:21:04.825 --> 01:21:07.577
I told you, you can't do that.

01:21:33.688 --> 01:21:35.624
What about that one?

01:21:35.724 --> 01:21:37.376
- That one's perfect.
- What about it?

01:21:38.126 --> 01:21:42.030
Well, you know, it's got those
tall windows that you like.

01:21:42.130 --> 01:21:44.447
I bet it's got a big backyard
for the kid.

01:21:46.400 --> 01:21:49.837
If we're buying fancy houses, we might
as well buy one for Willem next door,

01:21:49.937 --> 01:21:53.089
- otherwise I'll never see either of you.
- Now he can buy his own.

01:21:57.545 --> 01:22:01.063
You're never even going to try to live
in the real world, are you?

01:22:12.660 --> 01:22:16.365
- Yeah, hello.
- Karin, look, it's me.

01:22:16.465 --> 01:22:18.150
- Don't hang up.
- Cor?

01:22:18.700 --> 01:22:22.204
Now, listen to me.
I'm going to give you a number

01:22:22.304 --> 01:22:25.341
and I need you to tell Sonja
to call me as soon as she can.

01:22:25.441 --> 01:22:28.890
From a phone box some way over
from the house. You understand?

01:22:28.990 --> 01:22:32.274
- Where are you?
- Listen to me. Listen to me, please.

01:22:32.374 --> 01:22:36.265
Promise me, look, it's for her.

01:22:53.167 --> 01:22:55.537
- Hello?
- What did you do, Cor?

01:22:55.637 --> 01:22:57.406
What the hell did you do?

01:22:57.506 --> 01:23:00.075
Don't start that now,
we haven't got time for that.

01:23:00.175 --> 01:23:01.407
Look, there's no time...

01:23:01.507 --> 01:23:05.213
Cor, what the hell did you do?
Cor, where are you?

01:23:05.313 --> 01:23:09.321
Answer me, Cor. Where...? Cor?

01:23:10.385 --> 01:23:14.115
Cor? Where...? Where are you?

01:23:14.890 --> 01:23:17.660
Sonja? Son... Sonja, are you there?

01:23:17.760 --> 01:23:21.112
- Sonja, Sonja!
- I'm here. I'm here, Cor.

01:23:21.945 --> 01:23:23.748
Cor, Cor, this is...

01:23:24.217 --> 01:23:27.350
they follow me everywhere.

01:23:27.970 --> 01:23:31.721
I know. Listen,
I just wanted to hear your voice.

01:23:33.742 --> 01:23:38.486
If I buy a loaf of bread,
they check my money in case it's...

01:23:40.182 --> 01:23:42.064
I want to be where you are.

01:23:43.851 --> 01:23:45.481
Please.

01:23:52.660 --> 01:23:55.365
Soon, Son, soon.

01:23:55.897 --> 01:23:57.509
Listen,

01:23:58.533 --> 01:24:01.214
after the baby,
I can come back, alright?

01:24:02.037 --> 01:24:05.871
- Soon. That's a promise.
- You promise?

01:24:06.341 --> 01:24:10.358
I promise. I promise,
I promise, I promise.

01:24:10.545 --> 01:24:12.935
Listen to me, okay, Son, listen?

01:24:13.949 --> 01:24:16.901
We're going to be a real family.
You know?

01:24:17.851 --> 01:24:20.285
We'll be a real family...

01:24:20.385 --> 01:24:23.566
and I'm going to give you
everything you ever wanted.

01:24:25.092 --> 01:24:27.299
And believe me.

01:24:27.829 --> 01:24:30.248
- You believe me?
- I believe you.

01:24:30.598 --> 01:24:34.487
But, Cor, do you know
how big this thing is?

01:24:35.137 --> 01:24:39.241
They've arrested everybody you ever met
in your life. They bugged all the phones.

01:24:39.341 --> 01:24:41.143
Wait, wait, wait.
What do you mean everyone?

01:24:41.243 --> 01:24:43.879
Like Arthur and my parents,

01:24:43.979 --> 01:24:48.066
- Your parents?
- All your friends, all of mine, everybody's.

01:24:48.635 --> 01:24:51.485
Cor, I've got to go.

01:24:51.753 --> 01:24:55.103
- I love you. Okay? Be safe.
- No, don't hang up! Don't hang up!

01:24:55.203 --> 01:24:57.955
- Son, don't hang up!
- I love you!

01:25:35.029 --> 01:25:36.783
I...

01:25:38.166 --> 01:25:40.195
I think I messed up.

01:25:41.402 --> 01:25:44.137
I think they have this number...

01:25:45.206 --> 01:25:47.270
since last night.

01:25:49.043 --> 01:25:51.829
Just... just letting you know.

01:25:58.051 --> 01:26:00.700
We better get our stuff then.

01:26:28.983 --> 01:26:31.704
Willem, wait.

01:26:32.487 --> 01:26:34.770
Something feels wrong.

01:26:37.025 --> 01:26:39.261
It seems too quiet.

01:27:07.121 --> 01:27:09.378
You want to do this?

01:27:09.557 --> 01:27:12.177
You know, I think I'll sit this one out.

01:27:12.627 --> 01:27:14.062
In prison?

01:27:14.162 --> 01:27:16.765
Look, we can get out
while we're still young.

01:27:16.865 --> 01:27:19.530
They'll never find the money.

01:27:21.302 --> 01:27:23.218
You want to bet?

01:27:26.540 --> 01:27:28.533
You know I do.

01:29:14.615 --> 01:29:18.887
There are two ways a man can be rich
in this world. He can have a lot of money...

01:29:18.987 --> 01:29:21.709
or he can have a lot of friends.

01:29:22.457 --> 01:29:24.974
But he cannot have both.
