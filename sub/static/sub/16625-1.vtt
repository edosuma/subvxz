02:10.199 --> 02:12.867
Poland, December 1945

03:26.783 --> 03:28.821
Sister, sister!

03:35.367 --> 03:37.772
Do you have money? - Take me to a doctor.

03:37.950 --> 03:40.024
10 zlotys.

03:40.200 --> 03:43.779
I have no money. - I'll help you if I get anything.

03:46.825 --> 03:50.984
Is this good? No Polish or Russian doctor.

04:33.450 --> 04:35.985
Why is that nun here?

04:36.200 --> 04:38.523
Are you ready to go?

04:51.492 --> 04:53.566
Come with me.

04:55.658 --> 04:58.491
Is there still any penicillin here?

04:58.658 --> 05:01.147
No, not anymore.

05:01.325 --> 05:03.363
This is all.

05:05.033 --> 05:08.897
Do you use it sometimes for yourself? - Very funny.

05:09.950 --> 05:12.901
Doctor ... - I have no time.

05:13.075 --> 05:15.445
You are needed here.

05:17.200 --> 05:20.447
I need help. - I do not understand.

05:20.617 --> 05:23.319
Sick woman ... Polish.

05:23.492 --> 05:26.359
Here, only the French.

05:27.575 --> 05:29.365
She will die.

05:30.408 --> 05:32.564
The woman will die.

05:32.742 --> 05:35.775
You have to go to the Polish Red Cross.

05:35.950 --> 05:38.106
I do not understand. Help me.

05:38.283 --> 05:41.814
The Polish Red Cross. - No. Please!

05:41.992 --> 05:43.781
Sorry...

05:43.950 --> 05:47.150
Help me. - Polish, okay?

06:23.658 --> 06:25.116
Cut.

06:28.783 --> 06:30.359
Good.

06:30.533 --> 06:33.022
Take it off.

09:19.992 --> 09:21.947
Who is that?

09:22.117 --> 09:25.980
A doctor. I was worried. - Go to your cell.

09:32.783 --> 09:35.272
Do you speak French?

09:37.408 --> 09:39.778
Yes I speak French.

09:44.158 --> 09:48.448
Are you a doctor? - I work for the Red Cross.

09:48.658 --> 09:50.281
I'm Sister Mary.

09:50.408 --> 09:53.276
This is our abbess, Mother Jadwiga Oledzka.

09:53.450 --> 09:55.654
Mathilde Beaulieu.

10:00.158 --> 10:03.690
Is this going to take long? - From yesterday.

10:05.783 --> 10:08.106
Her family put her out of the house.

10:08.283 --> 10:11.234
We take care of it here in the greatest secrecy.

10:11.408 --> 10:14.525
Do not worry, I have my professional confidentiality.

10:29.283 --> 10:33.608
Should it be that way? - Do you know any other way?

10:33.783 --> 10:37.030
Don't fight it.

10:50.950 --> 10:54.529
It's a breech. I will have to operate.

10:57.783 --> 11:01.196
What did she say? - It'll be fine.

11:01.325 --> 11:04.691
Get the priest! - Calm down.

12:17.783 --> 12:19.490
The lamp.

13:18.367 --> 13:19.859
Here.

13:50.783 --> 13:53.698
I'll be back tomorrow with penicillin.

13:54.950 --> 14:00.105
Thanks, but that's not necessary. We have our herbalist.

14:01.575 --> 14:04.857
I want to check if there are any complications.

14:08.283 --> 14:11.198
I do not understand your attitude. It's a simple request.

14:11.367 --> 14:14.981
Easy for you but not necessarily for us.

14:15.158 --> 14:20.148
If something goes wrong, you are also responsible for the mother and child.

14:20.325 --> 14:24.105
Just tell me if I can come back tomorrow.

14:27.367 --> 14:30.567
Come at the time of Laudes

14:30.742 --> 14:32.816
That is the morning prayer.

14:33.033 --> 14:36.861
During prayer I will let you inside. - Fine.

15:24.575 --> 15:26.861
Hello.

15:41.242 --> 15:42.948
Sorry.

15:44.367 --> 15:46.488
There you are.

15:48.325 --> 15:50.778
Tweezers.

15:50.908 --> 15:53.741
Tweezers. If it's not inconvenient.

15:58.117 --> 16:00.652
Have you just woken up?

16:05.408 --> 16:07.233
It looks very ugly.

16:13.450 --> 16:15.192
Compress.

16:17.867 --> 16:20.236
What did you do last night?

16:21.242 --> 16:26.029
I'll finish with Gaspard. Go get coffee or a shot of adrenaline.

16:26.200 --> 16:29.815
Actually go to sleep... I can't use you.

16:29.992 --> 16:33.938
I couldn't sleep. - Are you sleeping poorly? Since when?

16:37.450 --> 16:39.357
Leave!

16:39.533 --> 16:41.820
Go away!

16:41.950 --> 16:44.190
Gaspard, compress.

17:14.242 --> 17:17.939
You forget that our lives no longer belong to us.

17:18.992 --> 17:20.817
I know you're sad

17:20.992 --> 17:24.902
since God called our sister to his side two months ago.

17:25.075 --> 17:27.858
But grief is not an excuse.

17:28.075 --> 17:32.567
You have violated one of the rules: obedience.

17:32.742 --> 17:36.735
And that's not the first time. - Forgive me, mother.

17:36.908 --> 17:41.365
I've already forgiven you before. And I forgive you again.

17:42.825 --> 17:45.444
Do not test our patience..

17:46.492 --> 17:50.355
You will stay a week in your cell and take a vow of silence.

17:50.533 --> 17:54.609
Sister Johanna will bring your food. That's all.

19:12.658 --> 19:16.403
Did anyone see you? - No, I have not seen anyone.

19:34.117 --> 19:37.233
I need to see the scar.

19:37.408 --> 19:40.075
Show her the scar.

19:42.950 --> 19:44.822
No.

19:46.242 --> 19:49.193
Tell her to do it. - Sister, let her look.

19:50.283 --> 19:52.239
I cannot do it.

19:56.158 --> 19:58.315
I cannot do it.

20:01.908 --> 20:05.854
This is in order to clean it. Twice a day.

20:26.450 --> 20:30.360
I would like to see the baby. - He is not here anymore.

20:31.533 --> 20:33.738
Mother Superior has taken him to Zofia's aunt.

20:33.908 --> 20:37.819
I thought the baby had been rejected by the family. - Only her parents.

20:37.992 --> 20:40.527
But this is a pious aunt with many children.

20:40.742 --> 20:42.981
She will take good care of him.

21:31.283 --> 21:33.155
Sister?

21:35.617 --> 21:37.489
Sister Anna!

21:51.575 --> 21:53.317
No.

21:55.075 --> 21:56.900
I do not want...

21:58.867 --> 22:01.616
I do not want to die.

22:01.742 --> 22:04.408
Sister, leave us alone.

22:15.867 --> 22:18.272
Join me in my office.

22:19.408 --> 22:21.565
Follow me.

22:29.575 --> 22:34.481
We were first persecuted by the Germans and then the Russians came.

22:50.992 --> 22:53.480
For us, when they ...

22:53.658 --> 22:58.067
broke into our monastery, it was ...

22:58.283 --> 23:02.324
an indescribable nightmare ...

23:02.492 --> 23:06.071
that only with with God's help we were able to overcome.

23:08.075 --> 23:11.108
They stayed here two days.

23:16.700 --> 23:19.900
How many sisters are in this state?

23:21.700 --> 23:23.525
Seven.

23:24.575 --> 23:27.407
Or six, now sister Zofia ...

23:27.575 --> 23:30.692
God's help alone will not be enough.

23:30.867 --> 23:35.275
We are in the hands of the Divine. - You need someone qualfied.

23:35.408 --> 23:40.030
I can send some discreet women from the Polish Red Cross.

23:40.200 --> 23:44.028
That would be the end of our Convent. They will close it.

23:44.200 --> 23:50.777
Outside the Convent, they will shame our girls.

23:50.950 --> 23:54.398
They will be hunted. Many girls will die.

23:54.575 --> 23:56.898
It is my duty to keep our secret.

23:57.075 --> 24:00.156
But they will give birth to ... - We will assist them.

24:00.325 --> 24:02.446
He already told me that.

24:03.492 --> 24:06.573
Then they go to heaven. Better for them.

24:06.700 --> 24:09.319
But to me what matters is life.

24:09.492 --> 24:12.904
Nobody will enter this Convent!

24:14.283 --> 24:16.357
Good.

24:22.950 --> 24:24.988
I will report it.

24:39.992 --> 24:41.615
Miss!

24:47.825 --> 24:51.486
Reverend Mother agrees. - Well, I'll find someone.

24:51.658 --> 24:55.403
No, you should do it. - No, it was an emergency ...

24:55.575 --> 24:58.407
You do it or nobody does.

25:21.033 --> 25:25.323
Let's drink to the amputees and our failures.

25:31.825 --> 25:34.230
Say something to me. You never said anything.

25:34.450 --> 25:39.486
And girls who never say something that is rare.

25:40.908 --> 25:43.444
Typically men talking.

25:44.575 --> 25:49.149
I just have nothing to say. At home we were not allowed to talk at the table

25:49.325 --> 25:51.944
or anywhere else.

25:53.242 --> 25:56.074
A Catholic family ...

25:56.242 --> 26:00.484
Bourgeoisie ... only daughter.

26:00.658 --> 26:03.443
You're wrong. A working class family.

26:03.658 --> 26:06.277
My parents were Communists of the first hour.

26:06.450 --> 26:08.026
Okay...

26:08.200 --> 26:10.404
They had relocated for my studies ...

26:10.575 --> 26:14.651
and when I left everything to come here, they felt cheated.

26:15.992 --> 26:19.571
You see, if you want, you can talk.

26:19.742 --> 26:23.403
That's the vodka. You did it.

26:26.242 --> 26:29.489
But enough about me. Now you.

26:29.700 --> 26:31.406
Well, as for me..

26:32.575 --> 26:34.980
A very wealthy family.

26:35.158 --> 26:38.322
obviously not very Catholic.

26:38.492 --> 26:40.861
with us, it was a lawyer or doctor.

26:41.033 --> 26:45.358
And because I detest the "blah blah", I chose Medicine.

26:45.533 --> 26:49.397
So you're the pride of your parents? - That was me.

27:02.158 --> 27:07.444
She died in Bergen-Belsen. Fortunately, I'm an only child.

27:11.242 --> 27:15.567
I left in '40 to London, but not through the Free Zone.

27:15.742 --> 27:18.360
That was what saved me

27:20.075 --> 27:23.855
I do not think I will go back to France after this mission.

27:24.033 --> 27:26.522
I can go where I want.

27:26.658 --> 27:28.696
I'm free.

27:29.742 --> 27:31.981
You are not?

27:38.992 --> 27:41.658
You have not had enough of this?

27:41.825 --> 27:44.823
That anguished expression all the time ...

27:54.742 --> 27:57.111
Enough melancholy.

28:01.825 --> 28:03.531
Come on!

28:29.783 --> 28:31.904
We are here.

28:38.408 --> 28:40.565
I'm coming with you.

28:42.117 --> 28:44.238
Goodnight.

28:44.408 --> 28:46.233
I do not want that. - Me neither.

28:46.408 --> 28:49.241
I mean it. - Me too.

28:50.283 --> 28:52.239
What? - You're too old anyway.

28:52.450 --> 28:54.441
That's very flattering of you, frankly....

28:54.617 --> 28:57.531
That's not what you said the first time!

28:58.533 --> 29:02.314
That's also a lie. I may be ugly, but not old.

29:02.492 --> 29:05.324
You're not as ugly.

29:05.492 --> 29:08.739
Oh no? Come here.

29:08.908 --> 29:11.065
What? - Come here.

29:11.242 --> 29:14.074
I see that as encouragement.

29:23.325 --> 29:24.782
Watch out!

29:24.950 --> 29:26.905
Help me! - How?

29:27.075 --> 29:29.066
Help me!

29:29.242 --> 29:32.156
I can not help you. - Help me!

29:40.117 --> 29:45.153
With time you will become better and better in bed.

29:46.658 --> 29:51.481
I heard something about the Communists. - Ah  .. Please ...

29:51.658 --> 29:54.064
It's not propaganda

30:17.992 --> 30:20.148
In your opinion...

30:20.325 --> 30:23.489
What will happen to the Polish Church under the new regime?

30:23.658 --> 30:26.822
What do you care about that now?

30:26.950 --> 30:30.647
Since when are you interested in the Polish Church?

30:30.825 --> 30:33.858
It was just a question.

30:34.033 --> 30:36.273
I hope they have a terrible time.

30:36.450 --> 30:39.946
And not only the Church, but also the population.

30:41.242 --> 30:45.022
That's not very nice. What have the Poles done to you?

30:45.200 --> 30:47.107
I cannot stand them.

30:47.283 --> 30:51.822
They got what they deserved from the Russians and the Germans.

31:00.325 --> 31:04.781
You're really bitter. - Maybe I have my reasons for that.

31:06.408 --> 31:12.108
The only nice Polish were in the ghetto of Warsaw.

31:15.242 --> 31:18.240
Now there's nobody left there.

31:19.325 --> 31:23.650
Damn, the owners. If they hear us, its going to be a problem.

31:23.825 --> 31:27.735
Nevermind, we will pretend they are not there.

31:35.742 --> 31:37.614
So...

32:48.158 --> 32:54.025
I can no longer reconcile my faith with this horrible event.

32:57.908 --> 33:02.482
I still see myself as God's bride ...

33:02.658 --> 33:05.147
yet he has so willed it.

33:05.283 --> 33:07.108
Willed?

33:09.867 --> 33:12.818
It has happened, so He willed it.

33:12.992 --> 33:16.155
We can not know what God's will is.

33:16.325 --> 33:19.074
The only truth is his love.

33:20.825 --> 33:24.025
And this life that grows inadvertently in me ...

33:26.783 --> 33:29.698
and which will soon be revealed ...

33:31.992 --> 33:35.108
What does He want me to do with that?

33:40.242 --> 33:43.156
Let us kneel, Sister.

33:43.325 --> 33:46.240
We will pray.

33:46.408 --> 33:49.359
That's our only consolation.

34:11.033 --> 34:15.904
Your aunt has accepted the child as a gift from God.

34:16.033 --> 34:19.280
They will love the child as if it were her own.

34:24.408 --> 34:27.406
I know this is difficult to endure.

34:32.492 --> 34:36.568
But it can deepen your faith and vocation.

34:42.199 --> 34:48.398
The diocese has no replacement for our deceased Father Piasecki.

34:48.617 --> 34:51.733
As for taking the vows ...

34:51.908 --> 34:55.239
it has already been postponed twice. That cannot happen again.

34:55.408 --> 34:59.153
The ceremony is in two months.

34:59.325 --> 35:04.480
In the meantime, some of you will be examined

35:04.658 --> 35:07.941
by the young woman from the Red Cross.

35:08.117 --> 35:11.814
She will help you. You have to trust her.

35:27.742 --> 35:31.688
The ceremony is in the spring. - Can we write our parents?

35:31.867 --> 35:35.907
Of course!  - Sisters, our duties...

35:54.283 --> 35:55.990
Sisters ...

35:58.075 --> 36:00.742
Who goes first?

36:13.742 --> 36:15.780
I'm afraid, are you?

36:26.533 --> 36:28.275
You should lie down.

36:28.450 --> 36:31.117
Lie down, sister.

36:59.950 --> 37:03.114
Everything is fine. She can get dressed again.

37:15.867 --> 37:17.692
No.

37:17.867 --> 37:22.192
They need not be afraid. I just want to see if the baby is well.

37:22.367 --> 37:26.574
Do not be afraid. They only want to see if the baby is healthy.

37:26.700 --> 37:29.023
I do not want to go to Hell.

37:31.450 --> 37:33.939
She fears for condemnation.

37:37.658 --> 37:42.446
It is perhaps incomprehensible to the outside world ...

37:42.658 --> 37:48.027
Despite what happened, we need to keep our chastity vow.

38:17.283 --> 38:19.570
I know they have been abused.

38:19.742 --> 38:23.154
I'm here to help. Tell me how to do it.

38:26.575 --> 38:28.365
It is difficult.

38:30.700 --> 38:33.900
We cannot show our body ...

38:34.075 --> 38:38.614
and certainly cannot be touched. That's a sin.

38:38.825 --> 38:41.230
I took a risk by coming here.

38:41.408 --> 38:44.608
Can we put God aside as I study them?

38:44.783 --> 38:47.865
You can not put aside God.

38:48.950 --> 38:51.485
So what am I doing here?

38:54.783 --> 38:57.402
I will try to talk to them.

40:18.533 --> 40:21.366
Stop! Russian Army! No Trespassing.

40:24.783 --> 40:27.450
Let her out!

40:27.617 --> 40:29.821
Papers!

40:29.992 --> 40:31.733
Hurry up!

40:31.908 --> 40:35.155
I am a French doctor. - It's a Frenchwoman.

40:35.283 --> 40:38.980
Frisk her. And you, search the car.

40:39.158 --> 40:40.900
Come with me!

40:41.075 --> 40:43.445
Help them search.

40:53.492 --> 40:56.063
Let's have a look.

40:56.242 --> 40:58.232
You're beautiful, you know?

40:59.283 --> 41:00.906
Bravo!

41:01.075 --> 41:03.564
Oh, how beautiful you are!

41:06.867 --> 41:09.533
Stop! - And ...

41:24.908 --> 41:27.278
Stop!

41:27.450 --> 41:29.903
She likes it!

41:33.533 --> 41:35.240
Get out of my way.

41:35.408 --> 41:40.610
It's a party, she wants us all.

41:42.367 --> 41:44.938
What is happening here?

41:45.117 --> 41:47.652
Get Out!

41:47.825 --> 41:50.195
Get back to your posts!

41:52.158 --> 41:55.358
Officer ... - Papers!

42:02.200 --> 42:04.440
What are you doing here?

42:06.283 --> 42:08.025
New?

42:09.783 --> 42:12.450
The French Red Cross?

42:13.617 --> 42:17.314
Okay. You can leave.

42:26.158 --> 42:30.531
Turn around. You can not pass here. Understood?

42:30.700 --> 42:33.367
Come on, turn around!

42:35.033 --> 42:37.782
What are you waiting for? Get out of here!

43:08.283 --> 43:10.854
Nobody here is bothering you.

43:18.867 --> 43:21.616
I'll tell the Mother Superior.

46:05.742 --> 46:08.858
Run! Hide!

46:09.033 --> 46:11.190
Run! Quick!

46:13.158 --> 46:15.196
Get out of here!

46:19.533 --> 46:22.448
Maria, take care of them.

46:22.617 --> 46:25.070
You have to watch them. Go.

46:33.408 --> 46:35.529
You two, over there!

46:35.658 --> 46:38.229
You hide enemies of the people.

46:38.408 --> 46:40.446
We aren't hiding anyone. - We will search everything.

46:40.617 --> 46:44.397
You have no right. - We'll see.

46:54.200 --> 46:56.689
Go look over there!

46:56.867 --> 46:58.692
The kitchen!

47:00.742 --> 47:03.028
Go now!

47:04.408 --> 47:07.157
Come on. - Faster!

47:11.450 --> 47:14.448
There is no one here. Look in the other rooms.

47:14.617 --> 47:16.607
Do not do that.

47:23.325 --> 47:28.527
Don't they know that the convent is in quarantine? Typhoid. An epidemic.

47:28.700 --> 47:30.986
What does she say? - Typhoid?

47:31.200 --> 47:33.605
Yes. - If you are lying...

47:33.783 --> 47:35.359
There is no fever.

47:35.533 --> 47:39.113
We have to leave. - It is very contagious.

47:39.283 --> 47:42.566
Why did you not inform the authorities?

47:42.742 --> 47:45.277
Answer!

47:45.408 --> 47:48.490
How do I know if it's true?

47:48.658 --> 47:51.360
They may go to the infirmary.

47:53.367 --> 47:56.567
You may go to the infirmary.

47:56.742 --> 47:58.898
Go to the infirmary? - No way!

47:59.075 --> 48:00.651
Let's go.

48:03.408 --> 48:07.153
We will report it.

48:31.742 --> 48:34.313
Mother.

48:34.492 --> 48:36.399
I'm tired.

48:37.450 --> 48:39.357
Can I do something for you?

48:40.617 --> 48:42.406
Do not you feel good?

48:44.950 --> 48:49.275
... Thanks for your presence of mind.

49:01.242 --> 49:03.398
Is she also ...

49:07.783 --> 49:10.319
I must examine her.

49:11.408 --> 49:13.482
She will not allow it.

49:13.658 --> 49:16.028
She prefers to face fate alone.

49:17.075 --> 49:19.231
She's too proud?

49:22.200 --> 49:24.949
It's Mother Superior.

49:25.117 --> 49:29.739
We should not judge her, we can only obey.

49:39.158 --> 49:41.196
Pardon.

49:43.533 --> 49:48.072
As much as I pray, I find no solace.

49:50.700 --> 49:55.073
Every day I experience again what happened. Every day.

49:58.700 --> 50:01.153
I still smell them.

50:05.283 --> 50:07.523
They came back three times.

50:08.908 --> 50:11.113
Every time they got us ...

50:17.825 --> 50:20.989
I thought they will kill us.

50:22.867 --> 50:25.781
It's a miracle they didn't.

50:41.492 --> 50:43.068
Thank you.

50:49.742 --> 50:53.486
I was less upset that the others.

50:53.658 --> 50:57.652
I had been with a men in my previous life.

50:59.992 --> 51:02.824
Most sisters were virgin.

51:06.158 --> 51:09.156
But no one has lost faith?

51:10.908 --> 51:13.397
You know, with faith ...

51:16.867 --> 51:19.616
First you're like a child ...

51:19.783 --> 51:23.611
your father takes you by the hand, and you feel safe.

51:26.950 --> 51:29.652
Then comes a time ...

51:29.825 --> 51:33.901
and I think it always comes...

51:34.075 --> 51:36.564
that your father lets go of your hand.

51:38.742 --> 51:40.981
You feel lost ...

51:41.200 --> 51:45.490
alone in the dark. You call for help but no one answers.

51:47.492 --> 51:50.063
No matter how well you prepare ...

51:51.283 --> 51:53.689
you will still be surprised.

51:53.867 --> 51:56.865
It hits you right in the heart.

52:01.700 --> 52:04.733
That's the cross we bear.

52:04.908 --> 52:07.859
Behind all joy is the cross.

52:24.033 --> 52:26.403
Mathilde!

52:26.575 --> 52:30.983
Please do not leave! - God bless you.

52:31.200 --> 52:33.819
God bless you for everything.

53:32.700 --> 53:35.402
I am so sorry. - Enough!

53:36.658 --> 53:38.696
I do not care about your excuses.

53:38.908 --> 53:41.990
You are part of a team. You're under my authority.

53:42.158 --> 53:45.986
If you cannot bring discipline, I'll send you back to France.

53:46.200 --> 53:50.064
Is that what you want? - No, sir, absolutely not.

53:50.283 --> 53:54.147
It's your fault, you should be arrested. - Colonel.. please...

53:54.325 --> 53:57.738
You are lucky that the Russians did not shoot.

53:57.908 --> 54:00.195
You had no business there.

54:00.367 --> 54:05.071
You ignored my orders. We were short a vehicle.

54:09.950 --> 54:12.024
It was totally irresponsible.

54:12.242 --> 54:15.074
I expect a report. You can go.

54:20.617 --> 54:22.821
Do you know the Colonel is an old Cruz de Fuego?

54:26.742 --> 54:31.979
So when he finds out you go to party meetings ...

54:32.158 --> 54:34.114
Don't be ridiculous.

54:39.158 --> 54:42.489
Enough mystery.

54:42.658 --> 54:45.775
Make sure you write a good report.

54:45.950 --> 54:51.401
I do not want her sent to France. I would really regret it..

54:51.575 --> 54:54.941
You are very nice. - Me, nice?

54:55.117 --> 54:57.949
Didn't I just say so?

54:58.117 --> 54:59.906
Would you really mind?

55:00.117 --> 55:01.989
You cannot imagine that?

55:02.200 --> 55:05.696
I mean work. You are an excellent assistant.

55:05.867 --> 55:10.773
I do not want to lose you. Even though you're a communist.

55:10.950 --> 55:12.359
But no party member.

55:12.575 --> 55:16.236
But he believes in a "new future".

55:16.408 --> 55:19.359
You have to believe in something. - Don't you think?

55:22.325 --> 55:24.481
What?

55:24.658 --> 55:27.229
What still goes on in your head?

55:27.408 --> 55:30.691
My head does not interest you. - No.

55:30.867 --> 55:35.571
No, but what goes through it. - There's nothing going through my head.

55:51.492 --> 55:55.071
What are you doing tonight? - I'm going to sleep. I'm tired.

55:57.950 --> 56:00.734
You lie badly.

56:44.075 --> 56:47.772
I can not come during the day. I am under surveillance.

57:00.492 --> 57:01.901
I heard.

57:04.742 --> 57:06.400
Without your hands.

57:11.075 --> 57:13.279
What is true soon!

57:13.492 --> 57:17.106
With such a rapid heartbeat is often a girl.

57:17.283 --> 57:19.440
Probably a girl.

57:21.867 --> 57:25.564
Sister, mother superior feels unwell.

57:26.825 --> 57:30.107
I have to go to the abbess. Thank you, sister.

57:37.742 --> 57:40.313
Do you have a sweetheart in France?

57:40.533 --> 57:43.366
A lot. - Really?

57:43.533 --> 57:45.192
Lie down.

57:45.367 --> 57:50.154
You are very curious. - Yes, I have a lot of flaws.

57:50.325 --> 57:52.860
I deserve the severest austerity.

57:55.492 --> 57:59.272
My faith has never been great. And after what happened ...

57:59.450 --> 58:03.858
I have lost all faith. I have no business here.

58:04.033 --> 58:06.238
Why do not you leave?

58:06.408 --> 58:11.859
I have no family. Only the old, pious aunt who sent me here.

58:13.867 --> 58:19.567
After giving birth I am going to just look for my fiance, I do not know where.

58:19.742 --> 58:21.567
Do you have a fiance?

58:21.742 --> 58:26.565
I think constantly about him, but I can not talk about it. I would be punished.

58:26.742 --> 58:30.190
He has caused this? A Russian soldier?

58:33.325 --> 58:35.529
He defended me against the others.

58:35.742 --> 58:38.942
He protected me. He even fought.

58:39.117 --> 58:41.652
He kept them from killing us.

58:45.283 --> 58:47.950
Sorry. Can you come?

58:49.158 --> 58:50.865
Thank you.

58:51.033 --> 58:53.901
Get dressed and go back to your cell.

59:10.158 --> 59:13.441
Mother, let her examine you.

59:27.325 --> 59:29.197
May I?

59:41.242 --> 59:45.152
I see indeed skin injury. To be sure, I have to do a test.

59:45.283 --> 59:47.321
A test?

59:47.492 --> 59:53.240
It is an advanced syphilis. It can heal. There are medications.

59:54.450 --> 59:57.234
I do not need your help.

01:00:10.200 --> 01:00:12.689
And if two births occur at the same time?

01:00:15.408 --> 01:00:18.856
I know. I keep thinking about it and it scares me.

01:00:21.117 --> 01:00:22.396
Thank you.

01:00:24.200 --> 01:00:26.735
We live for five years in fear.

01:00:28.450 --> 01:00:33.652
For us nuns, the end of the war, does not mean the end of the fear.

01:00:35.283 --> 01:00:38.151
The new regime will not spare us.

01:00:43.950 --> 01:00:48.442
And you? Did you ever fear for your life?

01:00:48.617 --> 01:00:50.773
Me?

01:00:50.908 --> 01:00:56.146
I was a student when I went to the Red Cross.

01:00:56.367 --> 01:01:01.486
And suddenly I was carrying stretchers in the firing line, with the liberation of Paris.

01:01:03.908 --> 01:01:06.990
Sorry, but more than once, I peed in my pants.

01:01:12.450 --> 01:01:15.021
But I have never regretted.

01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:18.613
And I told myself that I would save lives.

01:01:24.783 --> 01:01:28.114
Novice Irene is in a good mood tonight.

01:03:58.825 --> 01:04:01.574
How can a baby be born this way?

01:04:04.075 --> 01:04:06.610
How can we have not noticed anything?

01:04:06.742 --> 01:04:09.028
An extreme immune response.

01:04:12.033 --> 01:04:17.864
The body is resists and no one knows how far it has been, even themselves.

01:04:20.867 --> 01:04:23.438
Does that mean ...

01:04:23.658 --> 01:04:26.491
there might there be others?

01:04:26.658 --> 01:04:28.649
Maybe.

01:04:28.867 --> 01:04:31.900
What should we do?

01:04:32.075 --> 01:04:34.564
How do I know?

01:04:36.575 --> 01:04:41.813
I'm going to warn the Mother Superior. - It is useless to bother her now.

01:04:41.992 --> 01:04:48.190
They must know each birth. She brings the baby to an adoptive family.

01:04:49.367 --> 01:04:53.905
They do not realize how vulnerable a newborn is.

01:04:54.075 --> 01:04:56.777
It is my duty to obey.

01:04:56.992 --> 01:05:01.483
You have a higher duty: to protect the life of this child.

01:05:04.033 --> 01:05:08.406
You're asking me to lie to her? - By omission...

01:05:08.575 --> 01:05:10.898
For a few hours... You will be rewarded in heaven.

01:05:11.075 --> 01:05:14.903
For an unbeliever, it's easy to talk about heaven.

01:05:16.283 --> 01:05:18.357
They must be fed.

01:05:21.658 --> 01:05:23.732
Sister...

01:05:34.658 --> 01:05:37.526
Novice Ludwika does not care for her.

01:06:39.533 --> 01:06:42.615
I found something for you to wear. - It's yours?

01:06:43.658 --> 01:06:47.983
This dress I wore when I arrived here. - It's beautiful.

01:06:48.117 --> 01:06:50.154
I was flirty.

01:06:51.950 --> 01:06:54.734
I liked men and they liked me.

01:07:10.033 --> 01:07:12.569
Do you ever regret?

01:07:15.367 --> 01:07:19.195
Faith is 24 hours and the other is a minute of hope.

01:07:21.825 --> 01:07:25.949
In the beginning I struggled with discipline.

01:07:26.117 --> 01:07:28.440
And also with the chastity.

01:07:30.950 --> 01:07:34.944
I know that happiness is not the goal that we pursue ...

01:07:36.950 --> 01:07:38.692
but without the war ...

01:07:39.908 --> 01:07:42.397
without those horrors ...

01:07:43.450 --> 01:07:46.732
I could say that I'm happy.

01:07:46.908 --> 01:07:49.065
You were lucky.

01:07:52.575 --> 01:07:53.902
Not you?

01:07:55.783 --> 01:07:57.739
I do not know.

01:08:03.742 --> 01:08:05.567
What do you miss?

01:08:07.700 --> 01:08:09.607
Do you want to convert me?

01:08:11.992 --> 01:08:14.397
It's a sincere question.

01:08:22.575 --> 01:08:25.407
No one can give really answer that.

01:08:27.450 --> 01:08:29.736
Nobody in the outside world.

01:08:53.867 --> 01:08:56.023
Cigarette?

01:09:17.992 --> 01:09:24.522
I have not always been good news, but this will do you fine.

01:09:24.742 --> 01:09:28.652
At the end of the month we leave.

01:09:28.867 --> 01:09:32.564
The lucky ones go back to our beloved homeland.

01:09:32.700 --> 01:09:37.322
The others, including myself, have been transferred to Berlin, the French zone.

01:09:37.492 --> 01:09:41.354
Do not ask me why. No idea. Those are the orders.

01:09:42.617 --> 01:09:44.193
Any questions?

01:09:46.408 --> 01:09:48.316
Colonel ... - You're coming with me, Lehmann.

01:09:48.492 --> 01:09:52.817
No, I was wondering if it is not too early to end the mission.

01:09:52.992 --> 01:09:56.404
Why, you will miss it? - No, Colonel.

01:09:56.575 --> 01:09:58.980
Are all back our wounded?

01:09:59.158 --> 01:10:04.195
Yes. Despite the hassle with the Russian authorities, the mission is accomplished.

01:10:04.367 --> 01:10:07.614
Satisfied? - Yes, sir.

01:10:18.117 --> 01:10:19.526
That is bad?

01:10:20.617 --> 01:10:22.275
This is what is wrong?

01:10:23.408 --> 01:10:26.442
At the end of the month, we go our separate ways.

01:10:26.617 --> 01:10:29.449
You go back to your parents ...

01:10:29.617 --> 01:10:31.654
and I will be missing.

01:10:34.117 --> 01:10:36.783
Maybe he cares a little ...

01:10:38.200 --> 01:10:42.443
but I keep thinking that we will not see each other again.

01:10:42.617 --> 01:10:45.319
We can write. - Yes of course.

01:10:46.658 --> 01:10:49.194
A postcard surely?

01:10:51.533 --> 01:10:53.738
What is it?

01:10:53.908 --> 01:10:56.776
Do not like postcards?

01:10:58.325 --> 01:11:00.860
Sorry.

01:11:01.033 --> 01:11:05.323
I've never seen you cry. I did not know you could do that.

01:11:06.617 --> 01:11:10.693
Tell me ... Is it because we will not see each other?

01:11:17.658 --> 01:11:19.863
What then?

01:11:21.950 --> 01:11:24.485
You can trust me!

01:11:26.367 --> 01:11:28.274
Say something.

01:11:28.450 --> 01:11:30.405
It's nothing.

01:11:32.492 --> 01:11:35.655
Fine..Keep it to yourself. I'm going to dance.

01:13:44.742 --> 01:13:46.365
What!

01:14:34.658 --> 01:14:36.696
Calm down.

01:14:41.408 --> 01:14:43.814
Mathilde Beaulieu, please. It's urgent.

01:14:56.742 --> 01:14:59.111
Samuel, I need you.

01:14:59.283 --> 01:15:02.980
What is going on? - Just listen.

01:15:15.700 --> 01:15:17.821
I have not come alone.

01:15:21.450 --> 01:15:24.199
Do not worry. I'm here to help.

01:15:39.783 --> 01:15:42.651
This is Dr. Samuel Lehmann.

01:15:45.283 --> 01:15:49.573
Yes, I'm Jewish! There are still a few left.

01:15:50.867 --> 01:15:53.900
Where are the patients?

01:15:54.033 --> 01:15:57.197
He will keep the secret.

01:15:59.367 --> 01:16:02.732
How many doctors will let you come? - I did not know he was coming.

01:16:02.908 --> 01:16:05.195
Do you know how dangerous this is?

01:16:05.367 --> 01:16:10.782
We can talk for hours. There are women who are suffering and who are at risk.

01:16:10.992 --> 01:16:15.365
I'm not baptized and I will not go to heaven, but I'm a doctor. That's all that matters.

01:16:15.533 --> 01:16:19.990
If we are not welcome, tell us now, and we will go. You decide.

01:16:29.700 --> 01:16:31.193
If someone had told me ...

01:16:31.367 --> 01:16:36.273
I would ever help Polish nuns pregnant by  Russian soldiers ...

01:16:52.992 --> 01:16:55.066
Will take this long?

01:16:55.242 --> 01:16:58.405
They pray three times as it sounds angelus.

01:17:11.700 --> 01:17:13.442
Calm down.

01:17:19.158 --> 01:17:21.279
That's good.

01:17:52.867 --> 01:17:55.402
It's not there yet.

01:17:58.367 --> 01:18:00.938
They must continue to breathe deeply.

01:18:04.033 --> 01:18:07.031
Come see the baby Novicia Ludwika.

01:18:28.117 --> 01:18:30.688
Everything seems normal.

01:18:34.575 --> 01:18:36.696
She's cute, huh?

01:18:37.783 --> 01:18:40.070
Her name is Helen.

01:18:42.367 --> 01:18:45.069
So I call her. She is baptized.

01:18:49.742 --> 01:18:52.028
Her name is Helen.

01:18:53.700 --> 01:18:55.856
You have to go.

01:18:58.700 --> 01:19:00.856
Do you want to hold her?

01:19:23.492 --> 01:19:26.774
Tomorrow morning I will bring her to the  Ludwika family.

01:19:26.950 --> 01:19:30.316
And then I tell our mother the truth.

01:19:50.742 --> 01:19:52.732
Come to my office.

01:20:18.200 --> 01:20:20.238
Sit down.

01:20:21.283 --> 01:20:24.566
Punish me, please, instead of Ludwika.

01:20:24.742 --> 01:20:28.238
She did not lie, she do not even know that she has given birth.

01:20:28.408 --> 01:20:30.897
It's completely my fault. - No.

01:20:31.033 --> 01:20:34.067
The reason for his lie is that French

01:20:35.367 --> 01:20:40.190
I mistrusted her from the start. She has brought shame and chaos.

01:20:40.367 --> 01:20:44.064
Forgive me were, but shame and chaos already.

01:20:44.242 --> 01:20:46.114
Enough!

01:25:13.158 --> 01:25:15.196
Sister Zofia?

01:25:17.783 --> 01:25:19.857
What happened?

01:25:20.033 --> 01:25:23.613
I looked for her but could not find her ...

01:25:23.742 --> 01:25:26.360
Who? - Help me, sister!

01:25:26.533 --> 01:25:29.733
We must go!!!  Where?

01:25:29.908 --> 01:25:32.990
Where to? - She is dying! Helena is dying!

01:25:34.033 --> 01:25:36.190
I'll take you to her cell.

01:25:49.742 --> 01:25:53.605
May I open the door of your Kingdom.

01:25:54.992 --> 01:25:58.938
Give me the strength to continue on the chosen path.

01:26:05.575 --> 01:26:08.775
Help me to carry this heavy cross.

01:26:13.200 --> 01:26:15.274
Help me.

01:26:26.783 --> 01:26:28.193
Here.

01:27:07.950 --> 01:27:12.157
Do you have sugar make mother's drink?

01:27:12.367 --> 01:27:15.199
Yes, I think I can get it. - Thank you.

01:27:36.242 --> 01:27:38.363
Sophia!

01:29:09.033 --> 01:29:11.071
Is everything alright?

01:29:17.950 --> 01:29:20.106
It's not your fault.

01:29:22.033 --> 01:29:26.358
You have done what was possible. More could not be done.

01:29:28.033 --> 01:29:30.071
I do not know

01:29:30.242 --> 01:29:33.690
many people who can do what you did.

01:29:33.867 --> 01:29:37.991
Even highly educated doctors would have panicked.

01:31:40.408 --> 01:31:42.814
Mother!

01:31:52.075 --> 01:31:55.571
What is it? - There is somebody.

01:32:03.825 --> 01:32:06.989
God protect.

01:32:08.117 --> 01:32:11.399
I have very bad news.

01:32:11.575 --> 01:32:14.277
Zofia sister is dead.

01:32:15.658 --> 01:32:18.692
She's died yesterday. Sorry.

01:32:19.783 --> 01:32:21.904
Oh my God!

01:32:35.700 --> 01:32:37.774
Sorry.

01:32:40.908 --> 01:32:45.566
Sister Zofia left them this for the baby.

01:32:45.783 --> 01:32:48.568
What baby?

01:32:48.742 --> 01:32:51.609
My children are already grown.

01:32:51.783 --> 01:32:53.821
But the baby ...

01:32:56.658 --> 01:33:00.071
Excuse me. May God protect you.

01:33:14.658 --> 01:33:19.031
Mother, please tell me the truth.

01:33:19.200 --> 01:33:21.949
What have you done with the child?

01:33:27.408 --> 01:33:29.280
I had to do. - What does that mean?

01:33:29.492 --> 01:33:32.276
I have entrusted to God. - I do not understand!

01:33:32.450 --> 01:33:34.736
No?

01:33:34.908 --> 01:33:39.116
Do not you believe in Divinve Providence? I do.

01:33:39.283 --> 01:33:42.483
I believe that children were picked up by someone.

01:33:42.658 --> 01:33:47.197
What did you do? - What could I do! Now I want to be alone.

01:33:48.492 --> 01:33:50.399
Go away.

01:34:43.492 --> 01:34:47.189
Sister, I think Irent is giving birth.

01:34:55.658 --> 01:34:57.732
Just do your best

01:34:59.617 --> 01:35:01.607
Do not be afraid.

01:35:11.700 --> 01:35:14.367
A little bit more.

01:35:14.533 --> 01:35:16.405
It's coming.

01:35:19.242 --> 01:35:22.405
Continue to squeeze ...

01:35:22.575 --> 01:35:24.365
And!

01:35:30.408 --> 01:35:33.075
Still a bit, please.

01:35:36.033 --> 01:35:37.941
It's coming.

01:37:18.950 --> 01:37:23.607
Stupid. I keep thinking you will have forgotten me in a few days.

01:37:26.117 --> 01:37:28.901
and i think I could even say the same.

01:37:33.617 --> 01:37:36.366
You're really sentimental.

01:37:37.450 --> 01:37:39.773
Have you been drinking? - No.

01:37:40.825 --> 01:37:43.906
I'm just afraid you'll forget me.

01:37:45.033 --> 01:37:48.115
We'll bet on it. Come on.

01:37:48.283 --> 01:37:50.606
Can I borrow it?

01:38:22.492 --> 01:38:24.281
Help me.

01:39:54.908 --> 01:39:59.151
Tonight, I found the answer to the question that has tormented me

01:39:59.325 --> 01:40:01.992
Which question?

01:40:03.450 --> 01:40:05.571
I am a mother.

01:40:09.033 --> 01:40:11.948
I will always be a mother.

01:40:14.533 --> 01:40:18.942
He's my child. He deserves my love.

01:40:19.117 --> 01:40:24.402
What do you mean? - I'll fill my calling differently.

01:40:29.408 --> 01:40:32.027
God will show me the way.

01:40:34.117 --> 01:40:37.565
I owe you so much.

01:40:37.742 --> 01:40:40.147
I will never forget.

01:40:41.283 --> 01:40:43.653
Thank you

01:40:56.242 --> 01:40:58.813
I have an idea.

01:42:04.492 --> 01:42:07.324
Sisters ...

01:42:07.492 --> 01:42:09.613
Mother...

01:42:09.783 --> 01:42:12.070
Just listen to us.

01:42:16.325 --> 01:42:19.323
These children live on the streets and have no family.

01:42:21.992 --> 01:42:24.563
You can give them shelter.

01:42:26.617 --> 01:42:31.570
So, no one will wonder where the babies come from.

01:42:33.783 --> 01:42:37.611
You can keep them here and raise them safely.

01:42:54.075 --> 01:42:55.982
Sister...

01:43:03.200 --> 01:43:09.030
But Mother Superior has already found families for all the babies. Right?

01:43:24.658 --> 01:43:27.443
Mother, please speak.

01:43:40.492 --> 01:43:44.153
I wanted to spare you the shame and humiliation.

01:43:47.700 --> 01:43:51.610
I addressed myself to ruin to save you.

01:44:29.658 --> 01:44:31.779
Murderess ...

01:46:08.658 --> 01:46:10.779
Thank you.

01:46:19.617 --> 01:46:22.022
Do you have a cigarette? - Here.

01:46:22.158 --> 01:46:23.734
Thanks.

01:46:39.825 --> 01:46:42.148
And your child?

01:46:42.325 --> 01:46:47.029
They will take good care of it. I could not have done it.

01:46:50.242 --> 01:46:53.607
I want to forget it all.

01:46:53.783 --> 01:46:55.988
I want to live.

01:47:13.825 --> 01:47:16.657
Three months later

01:48:18.908 --> 01:48:21.113
Mother...

01:48:21.283 --> 01:48:24.032
Can I do something for you?

01:49:34.242 --> 01:49:38.449
Dear Mathilde. The dark clouds have disappeared

01:49:38.617 --> 01:49:41.152
and the sun shines.

01:49:41.367 --> 01:49:44.567
and we carry you in our hearts.

01:49:46.992 --> 01:49:49.907
Maybe there will be war again.

01:49:50.075 --> 01:49:52.231
New dangers threaten us.

01:49:52.408 --> 01:49:55.774
Soon, it will be difficult to write.

01:49:55.992 --> 01:50:00.863
But whatever may happen to us, we are ready to face it.

01:50:01.908 --> 01:50:06.649
I know, even if this makes you laugh, that God sent you.

01:50:08.200 --> 01:50:13.023
May He help you in all the trials and may you always find joy.

01:50:13.200 --> 01:50:15.356
Maria.
