WEBVTT

00:00.018 --> 00:03.477
I get visions. I actually see
what's going to occur.

00:03.521 --> 00:06.547
<i>I saw my own murder,</i>
<i>and you were in it.</i>

00:12.930 --> 00:15.421
It's not me.
It's you who's killed.

00:15.499 --> 00:19.230
<i>The only chance</i>
<i>we have of altering</i>
<i>the outcome of your vision</i>

00:19.303 --> 00:20.998
<i>is to confront it.</i>

00:22.840 --> 00:24.137
It's happening.

00:25.343 --> 00:26.332
Laura!

02:46.450 --> 02:48.042
Oh, my God!

02:48.119 --> 02:49.711
It's not
what it looks like.

02:49.787 --> 02:52.984
It looks like you're hosting
the telethon instead of me.

02:53.057 --> 02:55.787
Don't be silly, Higgins.
I'm just in charge
of security.

02:55.860 --> 02:58.488
I know that, you know that,
but the rest of the world

02:58.562 --> 03:00.621
thinks that you're
Chairman of the Society

03:00.698 --> 03:03.531
for the Preservation
of the Trisected Paolo Worm!

03:03.601 --> 03:06.399
You wouldn't know
a trisected paolo worm
if it bit you!

03:06.470 --> 03:07.528
They bite?

03:07.605 --> 03:08.697
No, they don't bite!

03:08.772 --> 03:11.263
They live in coral.
That's just my point.

03:11.342 --> 03:12.400
What is?

03:12.476 --> 03:15.934
That no reporter
could possibly mistake
you for me, unless...

03:18.382 --> 03:21.715
The day she interviewed me,
you took her to lunch,
didn't you?

03:22.553 --> 03:24.680
I think we may have had
a bite at the club.

03:24.755 --> 03:26.154
And then to dinner?

03:26.724 --> 03:28.157
Yeah, we did go to Nick's.

03:28.225 --> 03:29.351
And then you...

03:29.426 --> 03:30.723
I did not!

03:30.794 --> 03:32.762
Then how do you
explain this?

03:32.830 --> 03:36.231
I don't know.
It's just a simple mistake.
I'll call Tara...

03:37.735 --> 03:40.670
Miss Talbot, and have her
print a retraction.

03:41.172 --> 03:42.571
Immediately.

03:42.640 --> 03:44.164
If not sooner.

03:45.075 --> 03:47.509
Oh, sorry, Mr. Magnum.

03:47.578 --> 03:51.537
Jonathan, we are getting
frightfully behind
in the auditions.

03:52.683 --> 03:55.447
Mary Lou! Mary Lou!
Come back here.

03:56.754 --> 03:59.279
Sorry, folks.
Come here, Mary Lou.

03:59.356 --> 04:01.085
Sorry, folks.
Mary Lou!

04:01.158 --> 04:05.424
Ever since she did
that Happy Wiener commercial,
she hates to audition.

04:05.496 --> 04:08.056
Come on, Mary Lou!
Mary Lou!

04:08.265 --> 04:12.133
Except for you, of course.
She'll audition
for you, honey.

04:12.203 --> 04:14.103
Mary Lou! Mary Lou!

04:14.171 --> 04:15.798
I'm terribly sorry.

04:19.076 --> 04:22.273
No, that's great.
That's great, but you got
the wrong guy, see?

04:22.346 --> 04:24.974
Higgins is doing
the auditions.
Very good, though.

04:30.788 --> 04:34.189
I told you the newspaper
made a mistake.

04:34.258 --> 04:36.726
He's doing
the auditioning, not me.

04:36.961 --> 04:38.724
It's just a big mistake.

04:49.540 --> 04:50.973
I'm not him.

04:51.542 --> 04:54.306
<i>I liked the idea</i>
<i>of having my picture</i>
<i>in the paper,</i>

04:54.378 --> 04:55.936
<i>until I got my picture</i>
<i>in the paper.</i>

04:56.013 --> 04:57.241
Hi, shorty.
Hi.

04:57.314 --> 05:00.147
<i>Now, I was the target</i>
<i>of every aspiring performer</i>
<i>on the island.</i>

05:00.217 --> 05:03.448
<i>If they could do bird calls,</i>
<i>juggle dishes,</i>
<i>or do a handstand,</i>

05:03.520 --> 05:04.953
<i>they were doing it for me.</i>

05:05.055 --> 05:06.420
<i>Well, after a morning of it,</i>

05:06.490 --> 05:08.981
<i>I can almost tell you</i>
<i>what their act was</i>
<i>just by looking at them.</i>

05:09.059 --> 05:10.185
Mr. Magnum?

05:10.261 --> 05:12.559
Look, the newspaper
made a mistake.

05:12.630 --> 05:14.689
I'm not doing
the auditioning,

05:14.765 --> 05:16.733
Higgins is.
You'll find him
in the study.

05:16.800 --> 05:19.030
I'm sure he'll like
your fortune-telling act.

05:19.136 --> 05:21.366
How do you know
that I tell fortunes?

05:22.172 --> 05:24.197
Well, I just felt
like you did.

05:24.475 --> 05:25.703
Do you?

05:26.510 --> 05:27.977
In a manner of speaking.

05:30.881 --> 05:32.849
You have a unique gift,
Mr. Magnum.

05:32.916 --> 05:34.144
Uh, thank you.

05:34.218 --> 05:37.153
I came all the way
from Mokuleia to see you.

05:37.388 --> 05:40.186
Look, you don't understand.

05:40.758 --> 05:42.988
There's a man inside,
his name is Higgins,

05:43.060 --> 05:44.960
and he's doing
the auditioning.

05:45.129 --> 05:46.596
No, you don't understand.

05:47.131 --> 05:50.328
I've come here to hire you
as a private investigator.

05:51.402 --> 05:52.664
Investigating what?

05:53.871 --> 05:55.304
My murder.

05:58.208 --> 06:00.733
Like I said, Higgins
is auditioning the acts.

06:00.811 --> 06:02.108
This is no act.

06:02.179 --> 06:05.410
I'm a psychic,
and I have seen my own murder.

06:10.287 --> 06:12.346
Look, no offense, Miss...

06:12.423 --> 06:14.186
My name is Laura Bennett.

06:14.258 --> 06:15.282
Hi.

06:15.359 --> 06:17.384
No offense is taken,
Mr. Magnum.

06:17.461 --> 06:19.929
Most people make
the same mistake as you do.

06:19.997 --> 06:23.057
Although one would hope
that you would've been
a little more understanding,

06:23.133 --> 06:26.364
as you obviously have
psychic abilities of your own.

06:28.405 --> 06:29.497
Right.

06:33.477 --> 06:34.637
I see.

06:34.978 --> 06:38.846
You only believe
in your own little voices.

06:41.051 --> 06:42.575
Wait a minute!

06:43.253 --> 06:44.777
Wait a minute!

06:45.322 --> 06:46.448
Wait.

06:48.025 --> 06:50.425
Why did you call them
my "little voices"?

06:51.128 --> 06:52.459
That's what they are,
aren't they?

06:52.529 --> 06:55.794
Little feelings,
ideas, hunches

06:55.866 --> 06:58.562
that come at the most
unexpected moments.

07:00.404 --> 07:02.565
Is that what happened to you?

07:02.639 --> 07:06.006
You got this feeling
that someone was going
to try and kill you?

07:07.044 --> 07:08.306
No.

07:08.779 --> 07:12.237
I get visions. I actually see
what's going to occur.

07:12.316 --> 07:15.444
And this morning
when I was reading
about the telethon,

07:16.887 --> 07:20.653
I saw my own murder,
and you were in it.

07:22.559 --> 07:23.992
I know, I...

07:25.763 --> 07:30.291
I should have approached you
with some lie about
chasing an errant husband,

07:31.502 --> 07:35.734
and then gradually
eased into the truth,
but I don't have the time.

07:37.274 --> 07:38.332
I was in your vision?

07:38.409 --> 07:39.398
Yes.

07:39.476 --> 07:43.037
But you were too late,
and I'm hoping
we can change that.

07:43.280 --> 07:46.943
My visions almost always
come true in some form,

07:48.218 --> 07:50.709
and I would like to change
the outcome of this one.

07:53.624 --> 07:55.854
Well, I've gotta go
wrap up a case.

07:56.527 --> 07:57.755
But,

07:58.762 --> 08:01.356
we could meet
in a couple of hours
at the King Kamehameha Club.

08:01.432 --> 08:03.627
Say, 3:00?

08:04.701 --> 08:07.568
Yes. Thank you.

08:07.971 --> 08:10.599
Well, I didn't say
I'd take your case,

08:11.775 --> 08:13.675
but we can talk
about it a little more.

08:23.187 --> 08:24.745
Am I going to take your case?

08:28.392 --> 08:30.883
<i>My little voice</i>
<i>was warning me</i>
<i>to take Laura's story</i>

08:30.961 --> 08:33.554
<i>with a healthy dose</i>
<i>of skepticism.</i>

08:33.630 --> 08:36.530
<i>Here I was doubting her</i>
<i>because of my little voice.</i>

08:36.600 --> 08:39.693
<i>Only Laura didn't have</i>
<i>a little voice,</i>
<i>or a funny feeling.</i>

08:39.770 --> 08:41.361
<i>She had visions.</i>

08:41.538 --> 08:45.133
<i>And that's taking</i>
<i>psychic phenomenon</i>
<i>a bit too far for me.</i>

08:45.742 --> 08:46.800
<i>I think.</i>

08:47.578 --> 08:50.206
Oh, gosh,
I know what it is to doubt.

08:51.248 --> 08:54.479
Golly, only last year,
the real estate people
lied to me

08:54.551 --> 08:56.883
about everything
when I bought a new home.

08:56.954 --> 09:00.913
The roof, the plumbing,
even the size of the yard.

09:01.258 --> 09:03.852
Gosh, I know... You can't
trust anyone anymore.

09:03.927 --> 09:07.658
And that's why
I'm going to insist

09:07.731 --> 09:11.690
that you take a test-drive,
before you even consider

09:11.768 --> 09:14.896
putting out $2,995
for this little beauty.

09:15.739 --> 09:17.969
What's the blue book
on that model, Archie?

09:19.176 --> 09:20.768
I'll tell you what.
Come on, kids.

09:20.844 --> 09:23.210
Why don't you just
take that test-drive
all by yourselves.

09:23.280 --> 09:24.645
Well, don't you have
to come along?

09:24.715 --> 09:26.683
Oh, no, no, no.
I trust you.

09:26.750 --> 09:28.547
Just shift her
nice and easy, huh?

09:32.356 --> 09:34.620
Hey, see how
she started right up?

09:34.691 --> 09:37.159
That engine hasn't been
turned over in a month.

09:37.227 --> 09:38.524
Well, what about the smoke?

09:38.595 --> 09:39.994
Smoke? What smoke?

09:40.063 --> 09:41.894
Oh, that.
That's a little carbon.

09:41.965 --> 09:43.432
It's normal in this model.

09:43.500 --> 09:45.434
Especially when she's
in racing tune.

09:45.502 --> 09:47.629
Okay, go!

09:47.971 --> 09:51.668
Shift easy.
That's a fine-tuned
mechanism, not a tank!

09:54.912 --> 09:56.607
A fine-tuned mechanism?

09:56.680 --> 09:57.942
What do you want, Magnum?

09:58.015 --> 10:00.040
$633.

10:00.117 --> 10:01.778
I'll forget the 85 cents.

10:01.852 --> 10:03.217
I'll pay you
as soon as I can.

10:03.287 --> 10:05.084
Right now, I'm tapped out.
I'm broke.

10:05.155 --> 10:06.520
Divorce does that to you.

10:06.590 --> 10:07.955
I checked it out, Archie.

10:08.025 --> 10:10.459
You got more than enough
in the bank to pay me
what you owe me.

10:10.527 --> 10:12.586
You had no right
to snoop into my affairs.

10:12.663 --> 10:14.358
You hired me
to follow your wife.

10:16.700 --> 10:17.894
Racing tune?

10:17.968 --> 10:20.129
Ex-wife, and I ain't
talking about Thelma,

10:20.203 --> 10:21.636
I'm talking about the bank.

10:21.705 --> 10:23.297
I thought that they weren't
allowed to tell you

10:23.373 --> 10:24.931
how much money people had
in their accounts.

10:25.008 --> 10:26.066
They aren't.

10:26.143 --> 10:27.701
Well, then how do you...

10:27.778 --> 10:32.442
Oh, you know, you're
a very sneaky person, Magnum.
Do you know that?

10:32.516 --> 10:34.575
That's why I'm such a good
private investigator.

10:34.651 --> 10:38.849
Now, Archie, you have
the photographs that I took
of Thelma and Eddie.

10:38.922 --> 10:42.380
I want my money.
Tomorrow. In cash.

10:42.960 --> 10:44.257
Tomorrow?

10:45.662 --> 10:48.460
Okay. All right.
Tomorrow.

10:53.370 --> 10:55.634
I shifted into third
and something went clunk.

10:55.706 --> 10:57.435
Then there was
this sort of explosion,

10:57.507 --> 11:00.908
like a grenade going off,
and a lot more black smoke.

11:01.578 --> 11:03.842
I don't think
we're interested.

11:04.381 --> 11:06.747
Well, it is
a second-hand vehicle.

11:10.053 --> 11:14.251
Okay, young man,
I want you to pick a card.

11:14.424 --> 11:15.948
Pick any card.

11:16.293 --> 11:18.124
Well, look away.
Okay.

11:19.963 --> 11:21.794
Do you have the card?
Yep.

11:21.865 --> 11:23.526
Will you put it back
into the deck?

11:24.501 --> 11:25.525
Is it in?

11:25.602 --> 11:26.626
Now, you know it's in.

11:26.703 --> 11:29.365
Only T.C.'s
divine wisdom

11:29.439 --> 11:32.033
can ascertain
which card you picked.

11:32.109 --> 11:33.940
Which card did you pick?
Nine of hearts.

11:34.011 --> 11:35.137
Absolutely right!

11:36.346 --> 11:37.711
Wait a minute. Wait a sec.

11:37.781 --> 11:39.146
Hi, you guys.
Hey.

11:39.216 --> 11:40.706
Is there a Laura Bennett
looking for me?

11:40.784 --> 11:42.308
Table six,
the end of the patio.

11:42.386 --> 11:44.217
Pick a card, young man.
Pick any card!

11:44.287 --> 11:46.187
Higgins is doing
the auditions.
Oh.

11:46.256 --> 11:47.723
You didn't have my card.

11:47.791 --> 11:48.883
Of course I did.

11:50.927 --> 11:51.985
Hi.

11:52.429 --> 11:55.523
Listen, I'm sorry
I'm late. I just...

12:01.071 --> 12:02.265
Laura?

12:04.541 --> 12:05.872
Laura?

12:08.612 --> 12:10.136
He's drowning.

12:14.618 --> 12:15.812
Where?

12:23.126 --> 12:26.653
By a lighthouse,
above a road.

13:17.748 --> 13:19.181
Where is he?

13:19.449 --> 13:21.474
All right, the paramedics
are on their way.

13:42.372 --> 13:44.636
He's a little waterlogged,
but still breathing.

13:46.076 --> 13:47.065
Take it easy, kid.

13:47.144 --> 13:48.133
You okay, partner?

14:04.561 --> 14:06.028
He's gonna be all right.

14:19.891 --> 14:21.415
Well,
that was when I was six.

14:21.493 --> 14:25.793
And then, I didn't have
another vision
until I was about 10.

14:26.364 --> 14:29.128
I saw the house
next door to ours
burning down.

14:29.200 --> 14:31.134
I ran out, it was fine.

14:31.236 --> 14:32.703
Burned down the next day.

14:32.771 --> 14:34.033
Wow.

14:34.105 --> 14:36.096
Yeah, wow.
I thought I'd caused it.

14:36.174 --> 14:38.972
That's one of the first things
you have to try and get over,

14:39.043 --> 14:41.876
feeling guilty
about what you see.

14:41.946 --> 14:43.174
Have you?

14:43.248 --> 14:44.579
Not exactly.

14:45.383 --> 14:47.180
That's why
when something good happens,

14:47.252 --> 14:50.483
like today,
it balances everything out.

14:50.555 --> 14:52.546
Hey, you know, you could...

14:52.624 --> 14:54.489
She could tell me who's gonna
win the World Series,

14:54.559 --> 14:56.891
the Kentucky Derby,
the Super Bowl and...

14:59.030 --> 15:00.588
If I could,
we'd all be millionaires.

15:00.665 --> 15:04.829
No, I can't just
conjure up the visions.
They come on their own.

15:05.036 --> 15:06.469
Too bad, Rick.

15:06.538 --> 15:08.506
Yeah, I knew
there'd be a hitch.

15:08.573 --> 15:11.201
Say, look, you said
you work for the police,

15:11.276 --> 15:14.905
but how can you do that
if you can't just
conjure up a vision?

15:15.380 --> 15:17.541
They give me an item
from the case.

15:18.416 --> 15:19.678
An item?

15:19.984 --> 15:23.545
Yes. Right now I'm working on
a missing persons' file
with Five-O,

15:23.621 --> 15:27.887
and they've given me a shoe
that was dropped by the victim
when she was abducted.

15:27.959 --> 15:29.017
Oh.

15:30.395 --> 15:31.987
I think she's...

15:32.263 --> 15:34.356
I think she's
in a railroad car.

15:34.766 --> 15:36.757
There aren't any railroads
in Honolulu.

15:38.136 --> 15:40.536
If I gave you a bunch of stuff
from athletes,

15:40.605 --> 15:43.267
you think maybe
you can get a feeling
and tell me who's gonna win?

15:43.341 --> 15:44.535
Rick?

15:44.609 --> 15:46.304
What sort of stuff?

15:46.878 --> 15:49.210
Well, socks, hats, jocks...

15:49.280 --> 15:50.269
Rick!

15:51.282 --> 15:52.510
Jockey silks.

15:52.584 --> 15:53.846
Come on.

15:55.453 --> 15:56.545
Come on, Rick.

15:56.621 --> 15:58.748
I got a sunset flight
past Diamond Head,

15:58.823 --> 16:00.188
and your dinner crowd
is coming in.

16:00.258 --> 16:01.247
Let's go, buddy.

16:01.359 --> 16:03.259
I'm not uncouth.
I mean, I would have said
athletic supporter.

16:04.996 --> 16:06.520
T. C: See you, Thomas.

16:06.598 --> 16:07.963
Bye, guys.

16:08.099 --> 16:10.761
You three were
in Vietnam together,
weren't you?

16:11.402 --> 16:13.199
How'd you know that?

16:14.005 --> 16:16.838
Well, you're all wearing
a ring with a French Croix
on it,

16:16.908 --> 16:19.809
and T.C.'s cap
has got "Da Nang".

16:20.445 --> 16:22.106
Simple deduction.

16:22.881 --> 16:26.715
I wish finding my murderer
was that simple.

16:26.784 --> 16:30.413
Well, don't worry.
I mean, we're gonna
figure it out.

16:30.488 --> 16:32.479
See, I think
that whoever it is

16:32.557 --> 16:34.650
is connected
to one of your cases.

16:34.726 --> 16:36.318
Now, this
missing persons thing,

16:36.394 --> 16:38.157
is there any ransom note
or leads?

16:38.229 --> 16:39.423
No. Nothing.

16:39.497 --> 16:41.795
Well, what other cases
are you working on?

16:42.901 --> 16:44.960
Well, I'm on a retainer
from Lloyds of London

16:45.036 --> 16:47.903
to find a missing bottle
of wine that they've insured.

16:47.972 --> 16:51.271
Well, I think we can
safely dismiss petty theft.

16:51.342 --> 16:53.810
It's worth over a quarter
of a million dollars.

16:54.279 --> 16:55.576
For a bottle of wine?

16:55.647 --> 16:59.139
This particular bottle
was found in Hitler's bunker
after he died.

16:59.217 --> 17:01.981
It's a 1936 Lafite Rothschild

17:02.053 --> 17:03.350
with a swastika
under the date.

17:03.421 --> 17:04.887
But that's not the point.
See, the...

17:04.955 --> 17:06.513
Who was it stolen from?

17:07.191 --> 17:08.521
I don't know.

17:08.992 --> 17:12.656
It's not important
to me to know
who owned the bottle.

17:12.730 --> 17:14.163
What did Lloyds tell you?

17:15.433 --> 17:17.663
They showed me a rosewood box
that held the bottle,

17:17.734 --> 17:19.566
they showed me
a photograph of the bottle,

17:19.637 --> 17:21.798
and they showed me
a photograph of a house.

17:21.873 --> 17:23.396
Well, mansion.

17:24.142 --> 17:26.702
I concentrate
on those three things.

17:27.679 --> 17:28.737
And?

17:29.547 --> 17:31.242
Well, nothing yet.

17:31.716 --> 17:34.708
Well, I have a feeling
that the bottle
is still on the Islands.

17:36.988 --> 17:39.684
Well, we've gotta
find the owner
of that bottle of wine.

17:40.124 --> 17:41.785
That's difficult.

17:43.261 --> 17:44.660
Not really.

17:45.463 --> 17:49.194
A 1936 Lafite Rothschild
with a swastika.

17:49.267 --> 17:51.633
That one is owned
by the Barrow syndicate.

17:51.703 --> 17:53.466
Although it hasn't
really been a syndicate

17:53.538 --> 17:57.474
since Reilly O'Shane
took it over in '69.

17:57.542 --> 18:00.739
He was rather ruthless
in cutting out
the other members,

18:00.812 --> 18:03.076
but what can one expect
from an elderly Irishman

18:03.147 --> 18:05.274
with rumored
underworld connections?

18:05.350 --> 18:07.284
Aha!
Aha?

18:07.752 --> 18:09.185
What are you up to, Magnum?

18:09.253 --> 18:11.653
That bottle of wine
was stolen.
Did you know that?

18:12.190 --> 18:15.057
No. How awful.

18:15.126 --> 18:16.718
About four months ago.

18:16.794 --> 18:19.456
That's why Lloyds of London
hired me.

18:19.897 --> 18:21.330
You're a detective?

18:21.399 --> 18:22.866
No, I'm a psychic.

18:24.068 --> 18:25.899
Oh. Of course.

18:26.604 --> 18:29.300
Nice try, Magnum,
but your
fortune-telling friend

18:29.374 --> 18:30.773
cannot be on my telethon.

18:30.842 --> 18:34.710
Higgins, Laura is not here
to audition. She is a client.

18:34.779 --> 18:36.974
She's just said
Lloyds hired her.

18:37.048 --> 18:39.312
They did.
And then, I hired Thomas

18:39.384 --> 18:41.944
to find out
who's trying to kill me.

18:42.320 --> 18:45.380
Someone is trying to kill you
over a bottle of wine?

18:46.157 --> 18:47.681
Of course,
it is a rare bottle.

18:47.759 --> 18:49.624
Oh, come on, Higgins.

18:49.694 --> 18:52.561
I think this someone
is this O'Shane character.

18:52.630 --> 18:54.791
I mean, maybe
he even stole
his own bottle of wine.

18:54.866 --> 18:56.857
Maybe he even
drank it himself.
Unthinkable.

18:56.934 --> 18:58.526
He wants to collect
the insurance money.

18:58.603 --> 19:02.039
He doesn't want Laura here
to psychic-out what happened.

19:02.707 --> 19:04.072
A rather interesting premise.

19:04.142 --> 19:05.268
Thank you very much.

19:05.343 --> 19:06.742
Only,

19:06.811 --> 19:10.440
Reilly O'Shane
died six months ago.

19:14.385 --> 19:16.250
Send in
the next interview, Agatha.

19:16.320 --> 19:19.881
<i>Jonathan,</i>
<i>I think you should</i>
<i>come out here first.</i>

19:19.957 --> 19:21.515
Agatha,
we're way behind schedule.

19:21.592 --> 19:24.561
Just send in
the next he, she, or it.

19:25.730 --> 19:29.063
I haven't been able
to find a single act
worthy of going on the air,

19:29.133 --> 19:30.532
and it's all your fault.

19:30.601 --> 19:32.398
My fault?
Yes.

19:32.470 --> 19:35.735
Your face is attracting
the most unusual talent.

19:38.309 --> 19:40.436
Hi. We're the
Kuhio Street Four,

19:40.511 --> 19:42.638
here to sing
for Big Daddy.

19:44.282 --> 19:45.544
You see?

19:46.651 --> 19:48.881
The newspaper
made a mistake.

19:50.154 --> 19:51.781
That's Big Daddy.

19:54.759 --> 19:58.661
One, two, three,
four, five, six, seven and...

19:58.729 --> 20:01.527
<i>I'm going on a manhunt</i>

20:01.599 --> 20:03.226
<i>Turning around</i>

20:03.835 --> 20:05.200
Jonathan!

20:05.536 --> 20:06.901
Poor Higgins.

20:07.738 --> 20:09.262
Well, what now?

20:09.440 --> 20:12.102
Well, why don't you
spend the night with me?

20:12.343 --> 20:16.712
Well, I mean,
you'd be much safer here.

20:16.848 --> 20:18.110
Honest.

20:18.182 --> 20:20.116
I know that, Thomas.

20:21.152 --> 20:23.552
As a matter of fact,
why don't you pick up
some clothes tomorrow

20:23.621 --> 20:26.351
and spend the next few nights
here? Uh, days here.

20:29.694 --> 20:31.992
<i>Laura was asleep</i>
<i>within five minutes.</i>

20:32.063 --> 20:34.190
<i>It took me a little longer.</i>

20:34.866 --> 20:36.800
<i>In fact,</i>
<i>I didn't sleep at all.</i>

20:36.868 --> 20:38.699
<i>It wasn't the couch.</i>

20:38.769 --> 20:40.532
<i>It was my little voice.</i>

20:40.605 --> 20:45.133
<i>It was working overtime</i>
<i>trying to tell me something</i>
<i>I couldn't quite grasp.</i>

20:45.443 --> 20:47.604
<i>The next morning,</i>
<i>I had to collect my fee</i>
<i>from Archie,</i>

20:47.678 --> 20:51.205
<i>and all the way downtown</i>
<i>my little voice</i>
<i>just kept whispering,</i>

20:51.282 --> 20:54.080
<i>only it was too low</i>
<i>to hear exactly what.</i>

20:54.352 --> 20:56.343
This was my car.

20:56.921 --> 20:58.980
I used to take my sweet,
little grandmother

20:59.056 --> 21:01.115
out for Sunday drives
around the island.

21:01.192 --> 21:03.319
Oh, we had such good times.

21:03.728 --> 21:06.891
Picnicking together,
going to swap meets.

21:07.832 --> 21:10.164
We were awfully close,
you know.

21:10.535 --> 21:12.833
Ever since
my mother ran away

21:12.904 --> 21:16.032
with that vacuum cleaner
salesman when I was five.

21:16.107 --> 21:17.165
Oh.

21:17.642 --> 21:19.269
I love this car.

21:20.044 --> 21:22.604
But, gosh darn it,
every time I drive it,

21:22.980 --> 21:26.507
it reminds me of the day
I had to drive her
to the rest home.

21:26.918 --> 21:28.613
You poor man.

21:28.853 --> 21:32.254
You told me your grandmother
owns a used car lot
in Des Moines.

21:33.691 --> 21:35.625
I'll be right with you.

21:35.760 --> 21:39.389
Why don't you...
Why don't you take it out
for a little...

21:40.131 --> 21:41.564
On second thought,

21:41.632 --> 21:45.261
just slide underneath
the wheel there.

21:45.336 --> 21:47.065
Get a feel for the vehicle.
Go ahead.

21:47.138 --> 21:49.163
I'll be right back, okay?

21:51.776 --> 21:53.573
Why do you do that to me?

21:53.644 --> 21:57.011
Oh, it's hard not to, Archie.
You're so unethical.

21:57.081 --> 22:00.346
That's not unethical.
That is creative salesmanship.

22:00.418 --> 22:03.649
Well, what do you think
the Better Business Bureau
would call it?

22:04.155 --> 22:06.521
I don't know what I'm gonna
do with you, Tom,
I really don't.

22:06.591 --> 22:09.924
I like you,
but the way you treat me,
it's hard sometimes.

22:09.994 --> 22:11.120
You don't have the money.

22:11.195 --> 22:13.527
You see what I mean?
That's what I mean. No faith.

22:13.598 --> 22:17.159
You don't have the money!
I warned you. I told you to...

22:20.004 --> 22:21.801
I suppose you
wanna count it, huh?

22:21.872 --> 22:22.930
No.

22:23.774 --> 22:25.207
I'm sure it's all here.

22:25.276 --> 22:28.245
Yeah, all $633.

22:29.547 --> 22:30.605
And 85 cents.

22:30.681 --> 22:31.909
And 85 cents. That's right.

22:33.551 --> 22:35.041
Well,

22:36.754 --> 22:38.051
can't say it's been
a pleasure.

22:38.122 --> 22:40.283
Finding out
your wife is cheating
with your best friend.

22:40.358 --> 22:41.791
It's no fun.

22:42.526 --> 22:44.460
But you did a good job and...

22:45.563 --> 22:49.522
Well, I guess
it's all for the best.

22:55.606 --> 22:59.337
Archie, what I said about...

23:00.344 --> 23:03.370
Forget it, pal.
We all make mistakes.

23:08.919 --> 23:10.113
There he is.

23:11.155 --> 23:12.213
Okay.

23:16.360 --> 23:19.557
<i>I won't say</i>
<i>I was paranoid</i>
<i>about Archie paying me,</i>

23:19.630 --> 23:22.861
<i>but I checked the bills twice</i>
<i>to see if they were</i>
<i>counterfeit.</i>

23:22.933 --> 23:24.332
<i>And they weren't.</i>

23:24.402 --> 23:27.462
<i>I guess it just proves</i>
<i>that no one is predictable.</i>

23:27.538 --> 23:29.301
<i>Not even a huckster.</i>

23:42.820 --> 23:45.084
<i>Then it hit me. Again.</i>

23:45.389 --> 23:48.984
<i>That little nagging</i>
<i>voice of mine,</i>
<i>telling me to watch out.</i>

24:11.315 --> 24:14.751
<i>I got a quick glimpse</i>
<i>of the crazies on my tail.</i>
<i>It was all I needed.</i>

24:14.819 --> 24:16.719
<i>I'd spent a couple of weeks</i>
<i>tailing them.</i>

24:16.787 --> 24:19.950
<i>It was Archie's ex-wife</i>
<i>and her boyfriend, Eddie.</i>

24:32.236 --> 24:33.794
Faster!

24:56.460 --> 24:57.654
Look out!

25:10.908 --> 25:12.500
You, crazy haole!

25:20.584 --> 25:21.710
Cops!

25:21.786 --> 25:23.276
I don't care. Get him!

25:29.994 --> 25:31.325
Watch it!

25:31.462 --> 25:32.690
Look out!

25:32.763 --> 25:33.889
No!

25:42.173 --> 25:43.197
Magnum!

25:43.274 --> 25:44.901
No, Kenny.
No, I can explain.

25:44.975 --> 25:47.967
I was being chased
by a couple of lunatics
out there.

25:48.045 --> 25:49.842
I know. You okay?

25:50.147 --> 25:52.479
Yeah, I'm okay. How did...

25:52.550 --> 25:55.075
Divorce work can be kind of
dangerous, huh, brah?

25:55.152 --> 25:57.848
Yeah, I got these
two nuts that I'm involved...

25:57.955 --> 25:59.388
Well, I guess they seem
to be all right.

25:59.457 --> 26:01.891
But how'd you know
they're part
of a divorce case?

26:01.959 --> 26:03.187
We got tipped.

26:03.260 --> 26:05.694
A guy called in,
said his ex-wife
and her boyfriend

26:05.763 --> 26:07.822
trailed you
from his used car lot.

26:07.898 --> 26:09.365
Archie called you?

26:09.433 --> 26:11.663
Yeah,
that was his name, Archie.

26:12.102 --> 26:14.730
You know, Magnum,
he may have saved your life.

It was a most unusual
rendition, dear.

27:27.576 --> 27:32.240
I've never heard
the <i>Star-Spangled Banner</i>
sung in those keys.

27:32.781 --> 27:33.873
Thank you.

27:33.949 --> 27:36.179
It was
very patriotic, dear.

27:36.251 --> 27:38.776
I hope I get to sing
for your telethon.

27:39.454 --> 27:43.083
Thank you. Goodbye.
We'll be in touch.

27:46.294 --> 27:48.524
The retraction,
where is it?

27:49.965 --> 27:51.159
I forgot.

27:51.967 --> 27:53.264
You forgot?

27:53.568 --> 27:55.001
You forgot?

27:55.570 --> 27:58.061
I still don't have
a single act for the telethon,

27:58.140 --> 28:00.870
and all you can say is,
you forgot!

28:01.243 --> 28:05.077
Jonathan, how about
a nice cup of tea?

28:12.621 --> 28:15.488
If the trisected paolo worm
becomes extinct,

28:15.557 --> 28:17.957
it will all be your fault!

28:25.367 --> 28:28.302
I don't think
you should feel
totally responsible.

28:28.370 --> 28:29.564
Well, I don't.

28:29.938 --> 28:32.600
I don't feel in the least bit
responsible.

28:32.941 --> 28:36.342
Well, maybe
a little bit responsible.

28:43.185 --> 28:47.053
Laura, in your vision,

28:48.723 --> 28:50.884
you said there was a car.
What color was it?

28:51.526 --> 28:55.963
Yellow. Yellow, I think.
Yes, the color's
not too vivid in my vision.

28:56.631 --> 28:58.496
No, that's close enough.
What kind of car was it?

28:58.567 --> 28:59.556
Cadillac.

28:59.634 --> 29:02.228
I remember the hood ornament
coming towards me.

29:02.304 --> 29:05.273
No, not at you. At me.

29:05.340 --> 29:07.865
It just happened
45 minutes ago.

29:07.976 --> 29:10.444
Oh, no. It's beginning.

29:10.512 --> 29:13.675
Yeah, well, whatever's
beginning, it's happening
to me, not you.

29:13.748 --> 29:16.717
It was a couple
from a divorce case
I was working on.

29:16.785 --> 29:21.017
Look, you said your visions
started when you saw my photo
in the paper.

29:21.089 --> 29:22.147
Yes.

29:22.224 --> 29:25.660
Well, what if it isn't you?
What if it's someone out
to get me?

29:25.961 --> 29:27.155
But I was shot.

29:27.229 --> 29:28.355
What if you weren't shot?

29:28.430 --> 29:31.399
I mean, you said
you thought the Cadillac
was coming at you.

29:33.068 --> 29:34.729
What else was in your vision?

29:35.170 --> 29:38.003
Well, just what I told you
before, just fragments.

29:38.073 --> 29:42.066
The... The grave,
the owl, the...

29:42.455 --> 29:44.286
The man in the coffin.

29:51.019 --> 29:52.816
The railroad car.

29:54.756 --> 29:56.690
It's not a railroad car.

30:00.695 --> 30:04.825
It's... It's a deserted
restaurant in

30:04.900 --> 30:06.731
an old sugar mill.

30:13.241 --> 30:16.301
<i>T.C. Knew of seven</i>
<i>abandoned sugar mills on Oahu,</i>

30:16.378 --> 30:18.744
<i>but only one</i>
<i>had once been a restaurant.</i>

30:19.047 --> 30:20.605
<i>He flew us right to it.</i>

30:59.988 --> 31:01.387
Is this it?

31:07.228 --> 31:12.188
Five-O, this is
helicopter Nine-Five-Alpha.

31:12.534 --> 31:15.731
We are at
the Malahona Sugar Mill.

31:24.679 --> 31:26.476
Why don't you
stay here with T. C?

31:36.458 --> 31:39.325
That's the same sign
as in my vision.

34:27.661 --> 34:28.958
Laura?

34:31.232 --> 34:33.199
Laura, Laura?

34:36.838 --> 34:38.304
You were right.

34:39.107 --> 34:40.540
It's not me.

34:41.909 --> 34:43.639
It's you who's killed.

34:54.837 --> 34:57.271
<i>So much for Laura's</i>
<i>missing person.</i>

34:57.339 --> 34:59.967
<i>But despite the fact</i>
<i>her latest vision</i>
<i>had also been accurate,</i>

35:00.042 --> 35:02.772
<i>I convinced her</i>
<i>no one was going to kill me.</i>

35:03.012 --> 35:05.981
<i>Now, all I had to do was</i>
<i>convince myself.</i>

35:06.315 --> 35:07.942
Run that by me
again, please.

35:08.050 --> 35:09.574
What good will it do?

35:09.652 --> 35:10.812
I don't know.

35:11.687 --> 35:16.454
Well, I see the trees
in a row and I see the leaves
twisting in the wind.

35:17.459 --> 35:19.188
Yet everything seems
to feel dead.

35:19.261 --> 35:21.525
I mean, that's the only way
I can describe it.

35:22.164 --> 35:25.600
And then, I see a man
walking towards me
on the path.

35:25.701 --> 35:27.032
Do you see his face?

35:27.336 --> 35:29.998
No, I just see his body
and the pistol in his hand.

35:30.072 --> 35:31.266
What kind of pistol?

35:31.340 --> 35:34.070
Well, it's
a snub-nose, .32,.38.

35:34.376 --> 35:35.536
You know guns.

35:35.611 --> 35:37.670
Well, yes, I've worked
with the police a lot.

35:37.746 --> 35:39.304
Get to know things like that.

35:40.282 --> 35:41.909
But you never see his face?

35:42.051 --> 35:44.952
No. Well, yes,
when he shoots.

35:45.020 --> 35:48.456
But that's only so I can tell
that he's a man.

35:49.892 --> 35:51.018
Go on.

35:51.093 --> 35:55.257
Well, and then, I see the owl,
and then I see your body
on the ground.

35:55.831 --> 35:57.731
You never see any other
faces in your vision?

35:57.800 --> 36:00.394
No, just yours
and the man in the coffin.

36:00.603 --> 36:01.729
Coffin?

36:02.972 --> 36:04.769
Yeah,
but he's decomposing.

36:05.341 --> 36:06.603
Decomposing.

36:08.243 --> 36:12.407
I've seen many dead bodies
in my visions,
but you get used to it.

36:13.849 --> 36:15.146
No, you don't.

36:16.986 --> 36:20.012
Is he so decomposed
you couldn't identify him?

36:20.089 --> 36:24.185
No, not yet, but, I mean,
I haven't the faintest idea
who it is.

36:24.293 --> 36:25.624
I think I do.

36:28.597 --> 36:33.159
I'm in a race against
the clock trying to save
the trisected paolo worm,

36:33.235 --> 36:35.430
and you have me
playing librarian.

36:35.904 --> 36:38.702
I'm sorry
we're inconveniencing you,
Mr. Higgins.

36:38.774 --> 36:40.605
Don't apologize, please.

36:41.076 --> 36:44.705
Higgins,
we are talking about
saving my life.

36:45.014 --> 36:48.074
What is that compared
to saving an entire species?

36:48.150 --> 36:49.481
Of worms?

36:49.551 --> 36:51.075
I rest my case.

36:52.388 --> 36:53.514
Thomas,

36:54.723 --> 36:57.954
if you are right
as to who's in the coffin,

36:59.061 --> 37:01.996
this may change
the outcome of my vision.

37:02.698 --> 37:06.031
Just because we know
the where and the when
of your vision,

37:06.101 --> 37:09.298
it doesn't mean we can
necessarily control the what.

37:09.672 --> 37:10.969
Does that make sense?

37:11.874 --> 37:14.570
Yes. But we have to try.

37:15.644 --> 37:19.375
I don't want
to belabor the point,
but I saw you killed.

37:19.715 --> 37:21.979
No, no, no,
you saw me shot.

37:22.217 --> 37:23.980
Twice. In the heart.

37:24.153 --> 37:25.484
Aha!

37:25.988 --> 37:29.389
I knew we had a '76 copy
of the Admiralty Club Annual
somewhere,

37:29.458 --> 37:33.485
because Mr. Masters and I
raced the Lucky Lady
in the Transpac that year.

37:34.329 --> 37:36.263
Placed eighth overall.

37:36.532 --> 37:37.556
Only eighth?

37:37.633 --> 37:39.191
I'm afraid so.

37:39.268 --> 37:41.361
Of course, we lost our jib
two days out,

37:41.437 --> 37:44.031
Mr. Masters broke his arm
when a whale rammed the boat,

37:44.106 --> 37:46.404
and I was out for two days
with an attack of malaria.

37:46.475 --> 37:48.670
Still, one shouldn't
make excuses.

37:48.777 --> 37:50.540
A whale rammed the boat?

37:50.612 --> 37:52.944
Yes. It was two days
before we reached Honolulu.

37:53.015 --> 37:54.676
Just after four bells.

37:54.750 --> 37:57.913
I was at the helm,
even though my fever
was 103.

37:57.986 --> 37:59.613
I remember the night
was moonlit, rather like

37:59.688 --> 38:01.656
the sea off the coast
of Lisbon in June.

38:01.724 --> 38:04.090
Higgins, the photo.

38:04.159 --> 38:05.490
Quite.

38:05.561 --> 38:09.327
I'm sure he's a member
of the club, because he raced
the <i>Black Swan</i> that year.

38:09.398 --> 38:12.060
As illegally rigged a sloop
as you'll ever find.

38:12.134 --> 38:14.967
It was frightful the way
that bounder cheated.

38:15.037 --> 38:16.436
Ah, here it is.

38:17.239 --> 38:19.332
Is this the man
in the coffin?

38:21.643 --> 38:23.838
Yes. Yes, it is.

38:24.146 --> 38:26.046
Reilly O'Shane.

38:26.315 --> 38:27.646
How did you know?

38:27.716 --> 38:28.705
Simple.

38:28.784 --> 38:31.753
I mean, all of your visions
have related to a case
that I've worked on

38:31.820 --> 38:35.085
or that you've worked on.
So, it seemed logical
that some fragment

38:35.157 --> 38:38.888
of one of your visions
would relate to
the missing bottle of wine,

38:38.961 --> 38:42.624
and Higgins said
that O'Shane had died
six months ago,

38:42.698 --> 38:46.532
and judging from the degree
of decomposition
that you described,

38:46.602 --> 38:50.629
it seemed possible
that O'Shane was
the body in the coffin.

38:50.706 --> 38:52.765
It's simple. Simple.

38:54.810 --> 38:56.072
It's brilliant.

38:56.278 --> 38:57.939
Or a lucky guess.

38:59.515 --> 39:01.745
Would you care to guess
where the wine is?

39:03.152 --> 39:04.813
I know where the wine is.

39:05.821 --> 39:07.413
It's in the coffin.

39:07.489 --> 39:08.979
He took it with him?

39:09.291 --> 39:11.589
How like the miserable sot.

39:13.095 --> 39:14.960
I'm going to call Lloyds.

39:15.931 --> 39:17.330
Their Honolulu office?

39:17.399 --> 39:19.094
No, London.
No, no...

39:19.168 --> 39:20.692
No, it's all right,
I'll reverse the charges.

39:20.769 --> 39:22.430
Don't call there yet.

39:22.504 --> 39:26.201
Magnum, a priceless bottle
of Bordeaux is sitting
in a coffin.

39:26.275 --> 39:28.675
I don't think O'Shane
is going to drink it.

39:28.744 --> 39:31.212
Of course, six feet under
would keep it
at a constant temperature.

39:31.280 --> 39:32.269
Oh, Higgins.

39:32.347 --> 39:33.974
Fifty-seven degrees Fahrenheit
here in the Islands.

39:34.049 --> 39:35.073
Nearly perfect.

39:35.150 --> 39:36.139
Higgins.

39:36.985 --> 39:38.850
Unless it's not on its side.

39:38.921 --> 39:41.947
I'm sure
O'Shane placed it properly!

39:45.460 --> 39:46.893
How can we get it?

39:48.163 --> 39:52.327
Why don't we let
the insurance company
and the police know,

39:52.401 --> 39:54.301
and let them get the bottle?

39:54.369 --> 39:55.529
Laura.

39:57.606 --> 40:01.940
The only chance we have
of altering the outcome
of your vision

40:02.110 --> 40:04.044
is to confront it head on.

40:05.314 --> 40:07.009
And that's why you hired me.

40:33.141 --> 40:34.733
I hate this.

40:35.244 --> 40:37.337
I don't exactly love it.

40:42.117 --> 40:43.106
What?

40:45.387 --> 40:48.845
Those trees,
they're the ones
in the vision.

40:59.701 --> 41:01.896
<i>I've always loved</i>
<i>John O'Hara's story</i>

41:01.970 --> 41:05.736
<i>of the servant who saw death</i>
<i>coming towards him</i>
<i>in a Baghdad marketplace,</i>

41:05.807 --> 41:08.640
<i>so he fled to Samarra,</i>
<i>only to learn</i>
<i>that it was there</i>

41:08.710 --> 41:10.701
<i>that death</i>
<i>had an appointment with him.</i>

41:15.117 --> 41:16.379
Thomas.

41:17.152 --> 41:19.746
<i>Laura felt I had</i>
<i>an appointment in Samarra.</i>

41:20.756 --> 41:22.587
<i>I had to find out</i>
<i>if she was right.</i>

42:00.028 --> 42:02.656
Higgins said
all the O'Shanes
are buried here.

42:19.614 --> 42:20.808
Damn!

42:22.050 --> 42:23.415
I don't need it.

42:37.165 --> 42:38.792
He's buried here.

43:07.929 --> 43:09.157
It's happening.

44:25.373 --> 44:26.397
Laura!

44:40.956 --> 44:42.753
Thomas! Thomas!

45:03.044 --> 45:04.534
It's over, Archie.

45:17.259 --> 45:19.227
<i>I still don't</i>
<i>understand why?</i>

45:19.294 --> 45:20.625
<i>Well,</i>
<i>it's quite simple.</i>

45:20.695 --> 45:24.654
See, Archie wanted
to get even with Eddie
for stealing Thelma,

45:24.733 --> 45:27.634
but he didn't wanna
hurt Thelma because
he still loved her.

45:27.702 --> 45:30.694
But he also knew
how angry Thelma was
at me

45:30.772 --> 45:33.400
for catching her and Eddie
fooling around.

45:33.475 --> 45:37.935
So. He simply let Thelma
find out when and where

45:38.013 --> 45:40.379
he was gonna pay me
for my services rendered,

45:40.448 --> 45:45.078
knowing that she would
talk Eddie into giving me
some nasty lumps.

45:45.220 --> 45:48.656
Then he calls the cops
in time to save me
from the lumps,

45:48.857 --> 45:52.088
but get Thelma and Eddie's
assault on record.

45:52.160 --> 45:55.994
Then he snuffs Eddie,
puts him in the trunk,
and follows me,

45:56.264 --> 45:58.994
and is gonna make it look
like Eddie shot me
and I shot Eddie.

45:59.067 --> 46:00.534
It was brilliant.

46:02.304 --> 46:04.238
Man, you've been
hanging around Higgins
too long.

46:04.306 --> 46:06.206
No, no, no, see,
it's quite simple.

46:06.274 --> 46:08.742
Whoa, whoa,
I withdraw the question.

46:08.944 --> 46:10.206
Thank you.

46:10.278 --> 46:11.404
Come in!

46:13.381 --> 46:14.678
Hello.

46:16.117 --> 46:17.243
Hi!

46:17.319 --> 46:18.343
Oh.

46:18.920 --> 46:22.048
Goodness, what's that?
You're making it for
the Guinness Book of Records

46:22.123 --> 46:23.215
or for the telethon?

46:23.291 --> 46:24.315
Well, it's just
a little snack.

46:24.392 --> 46:25.586
Oh, yeah, the telethon.

46:25.660 --> 46:27.855
I wonder what kind of talent
Higgie found.

46:27.929 --> 46:28.987
None.

46:29.431 --> 46:32.594
He's reading poetry.
No, Agatha's reading poetry.

46:32.667 --> 46:33.964
<i>You are the only hope...</i>

46:34.035 --> 46:35.662
And they've
only collected $53.

46:35.737 --> 46:37.295
<i>...the trisected paolo worm</i>
<i>has.</i>

46:38.206 --> 46:42.370
<i>And now, another reading</i>
<i>of Percy Bysshe Shelley's</i>
<i>poem.</i>

46:43.044 --> 46:44.375
Ozymandias.

47:01.096 --> 47:03.997
<i>I met a traveler</i>
<i>from an antique land</i>

47:04.065 --> 47:07.967
<i>Two vast</i>
<i>and trunkless legs of stone</i>

47:08.036 --> 47:11.494
<i>Stand in the desert</i>
<i>Near them on the sand</i>

47:11.573 --> 47:14.770
You're really terrific!
I'm gonna get the jockey silk,
the glove, the balls...

47:14.843 --> 47:16.538
Wait, wait, wait!
How did it come to you?

47:17.112 --> 47:18.136
In a vision.

47:18.213 --> 47:19.202
Wow!

47:19.281 --> 47:20.578
Television.

47:21.383 --> 47:23.214
I was watching it
in the main house.
