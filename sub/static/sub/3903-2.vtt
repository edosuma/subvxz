00:09.801 --> 00:12.601
Thirteen bodies, all female...

00:12.701 --> 00:15.001
eleven White, two Asian-looking.

00:15.101 --> 00:19.201
All between the ages of maybe 20, 30.
All very dead.

00:19.301 --> 00:21.001
From Eastern Europe probably.

00:21.101 --> 00:23.302
So this is, what, an accident?

00:23.402 --> 00:26.802
Your air pipe's up top, crushed.
Probably during the off-load.

00:26.901 --> 00:29.201
So, yeah, accidental probably.

00:29.501 --> 00:31.702
But that's his call, right?

00:34.101 --> 00:36.302
-Doctor.
-Frazier.

00:37.001 --> 00:39.001
How're we doing here?

00:39.901 --> 00:43.801
-How are we doing?
-I mean, what are we doing?

00:44.402 --> 00:46.302
What's the plan with all this?

00:46.501 --> 00:49.602
Is this your first
death investigation, Officer?

00:49.701 --> 00:52.602
Russell. Yeah, first and onliest.

00:53.101 --> 00:55.402
You got 13 for the price of one.

00:56.102 --> 00:57.901
We're gonna start cutting this afternoon.

00:58.001 --> 01:01.502
Anything you got by way of identifications
should come through my office.

01:01.602 --> 01:02.801
What identification?

01:02.902 --> 01:05.702
So far, we don't have
a passport or visa in the bunch.

01:05.802 --> 01:09.002
Whatever you find in this luggage,
send it over...

01:09.102 --> 01:12.602
or they're all going to the Anatomy Board
as Jane Does.

01:13.102 --> 01:15.402
Who's the investigating agency?

01:20.002 --> 01:23.902
If they were alive, they'd be illegals,
and that would mean lmmigration.

01:24.002 --> 01:26.903
-But they're dead, so they're cargo.
-Cargo, but no contraband.

01:27.002 --> 01:29.302
There's nothing to be seized
as a customs violation.

01:29.402 --> 01:31.503
They're dead
on Port Authority property, right?

01:31.603 --> 01:33.502
-Yeah.
-That's a state thing.

01:33.602 --> 01:35.402
We'll eat it.

01:35.502 --> 01:39.703
If it's accidental, then it's just about IDs
on these stowaways, right?

01:39.903 --> 01:41.802
Good enough for me, brother.

01:42.002 --> 01:45.002
No reason to open a full case folder
that I can see.

01:45.102 --> 01:48.003
Wait a minute.
You CID guys are rolling out on this?

01:48.103 --> 01:50.202
No crime, no investigation.

01:50.803 --> 01:54.403
All you've got right here, Officer Russell,
is a lot of paperwork.

01:57.603 --> 01:59.502
And then there was one.

02:01.000 --> 02:07.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:18.904 --> 04:20.904
-You don't have to do this.
-No?

04:21.005 --> 04:23.205
Anything you're gonna say
I already said to Spiros.

04:23.305 --> 04:25.506
You called him a Greek asshole?

04:30.306 --> 04:31.706
You think we wanted this?

04:31.806 --> 04:35.206
I don't know what the fuck
you people want and don't want.

04:35.306 --> 04:39.906
All I know is, I got a can full of young girls
suffocating to death on my docks.

04:41.306 --> 04:43.606
-This was a mistake.
-A mistake?

04:44.506 --> 04:45.906
They fucking died in that can...

04:46.006 --> 04:49.206
while this stupid son of a bitch sat there
with his dick in his hands.

04:49.306 --> 04:50.706
You know nothing.

04:50.806 --> 04:55.006
We understand you're upset, Frank.
We are upset, too, okay?

04:55.105 --> 04:58.206
Sergei was supposed to wait
for our friend to come off the boat.

04:58.305 --> 05:01.906
Our friend was supposed to tell us
that there was no problem...

05:02.006 --> 05:03.706
you know, no Customs.

05:03.806 --> 05:06.405
-He did not come off the boat.
-Why the fuck not?

05:06.606 --> 05:09.006
This is what we're trying to find out.
We don't know.

05:09.106 --> 05:12.706
Because you don't get the right message,
these girls are dying on my docks?

05:12.807 --> 05:15.006
This is how it goes?
On my docks, this happened!

05:15.106 --> 05:16.906
I understand how you feel...

05:17.006 --> 05:20.106
but we're upset, too.
Everybody, we're all upset.

05:20.706 --> 05:22.006
Nobody here wanted this.

05:22.106 --> 05:25.206
Uncle Frank,
they're saying it wasn't on purpose.

05:28.907 --> 05:31.506
You could've told me
there were girls in that fucking can.

05:31.606 --> 05:34.106
You could've told me,
so I didn't just shove them back...

05:34.206 --> 05:35.607
in the stacks like I did, right?

05:35.706 --> 05:38.507
Why didn't you tell me
what was in that motherfucking can?

05:38.607 --> 05:41.006
Now you want to know what's in the cans?

05:41.307 --> 05:44.106
Before, you wanted to know nothing.
Now, you ask.

05:44.206 --> 05:46.307
Guns, okay?

05:47.106 --> 05:51.607
Drugs, whores, vodka, BMWs...

05:51.707 --> 05:54.607
beluga caviar or bombs, maybe.

05:55.807 --> 05:58.907
-Bad terrorists with big nuclear bombs.
-Boom.

06:00.807 --> 06:03.306
I am kidding you, Frank, it's a joke.

06:03.406 --> 06:05.107
But you don't ask...

06:05.807 --> 06:08.007
because you don't want to know.

06:10.907 --> 06:13.707
Tell the Greek that next time
he's got something breathing...

06:13.807 --> 06:16.108
in one of them cans, I need to know it.

06:23.207 --> 06:26.407
Give him a couple of days, you know?

07:00.508 --> 07:02.208
So Roberto been caught?

07:02.308 --> 07:05.008
Yep, DEA got him in New York.

07:05.708 --> 07:07.608
Now the shit makes some sense.

07:07.708 --> 07:11.308
The money we sent for the last go-round
came back. All of it.

07:11.408 --> 07:13.708
Damn, they ain't gonna touch us now?

07:13.808 --> 07:17.008
Goddamn Dominicans running around
scared acting like we the problem.

07:17.108 --> 07:20.908
Roberto won't even see us.
Stringer had to go to the lawyer up there.

07:21.009 --> 07:24.309
They saying they have to be sure
before they get back with us.

07:24.409 --> 07:28.108
-They saying you only got seven years, so--
-So I'm a motherfucking snitch?

07:28.208 --> 07:30.509
They ain't saying they think it.

07:30.709 --> 07:33.408
They just don't know how
the Feds got to Roberto.

07:33.508 --> 07:35.709
-So we on the outside.
-Yep.

07:36.708 --> 07:37.708
Look...

07:38.809 --> 07:41.308
we hanging on to them projects with scraps.

07:41.408 --> 07:44.009
Avon, you gotta have somebody for us.

07:44.709 --> 07:46.609
A friend in Atlanta...

07:47.508 --> 07:50.209
owns a rim shop, name of Vargus.

07:51.409 --> 07:54.309
Have Stringer fly down there tomorrow
and meet him.

07:58.009 --> 07:59.909
You seen D'Angelo lately?

08:00.408 --> 08:02.709
He on the J-tier, you know what I mean?

08:02.809 --> 08:06.209
It's very difficult for me to get over there,
you know?

08:06.409 --> 08:10.010
So you ain't checking on him,
and Donette's out and about.

08:11.309 --> 08:14.309
-I don't know what's what anymore.
-Now, what's up with Donette?

08:14.409 --> 08:16.410
I leave messages, she ain't call back.

08:16.510 --> 08:19.109
She ain't had her ass down here
regular neither.

08:19.209 --> 08:21.509
We need to tighten shit up, Avon.

08:21.609 --> 08:23.709
She should be bringing his son by
every week.

08:23.909 --> 08:25.609
Yeah, I'm gonna put Stringer on that, too.

08:25.809 --> 08:28.209
After all he has done for us...

08:28.309 --> 08:30.710
Dee needs to be cared for, Avon.

08:30.810 --> 08:32.309
-Promises were made.
-I know.

08:32.510 --> 08:35.109
He took the 20, he ain't complaining.

08:35.409 --> 08:37.510
He is carrying a lot of weight for this family.

08:37.610 --> 08:40.809
And we keeping him close.
Dee being cold toward me right now.

08:40.909 --> 08:43.409
He in this motherfucker trying
to make adjustments and shit.

08:43.510 --> 08:44.910
Adjustments?

08:45.410 --> 08:46.710
Brianna...

08:47.010 --> 08:50.909
you know damn well I ain't gonna let shit
happen to him, right?

08:58.210 --> 09:01.110
-You got these off the boat?
-What, in winter?

09:01.610 --> 09:05.010
In a couple of months. Fringe benefit.

09:05.910 --> 09:08.510
Can't catch crabs in Homicide, right?

09:08.810 --> 09:11.010
Except maybe
the occasional emergency room nurse...

09:11.110 --> 09:12.710
every now and again.

09:16.810 --> 09:19.510
-Need some air in here.
-Leave it.

09:20.210 --> 09:23.011
I don't need the hassle if Rawls comes past.

09:26.111 --> 09:28.810
You're not the run-of-the-mill
kind of asshole, are you?

09:28.910 --> 09:32.311
-You're the special kind of asshole.
-I'm special, all right.

09:32.711 --> 09:34.910
How long did it take you
to figure out the tide...

09:35.010 --> 09:36.810
took that girl over the county line?

09:36.910 --> 09:39.311
-Three hours.
-Three hours...

09:40.311 --> 09:42.011
with your little harbor maps...

09:42.111 --> 09:45.411
and your tide tables
just to stick Rawls with an extra body.

09:45.511 --> 09:49.310
Never mind that you just fucked Cole
with a stone whodunit.

09:49.410 --> 09:51.911
-That's collateral damage.
-Yeah.

09:54.310 --> 09:56.711
Are you gonna waste that crab gut?

09:59.911 --> 10:02.210
You're a pussy, besides, Jimmy.

10:19.411 --> 10:21.612
-We need Omar, Jimmy.
-You see this.

10:22.411 --> 10:25.311
-Thirteen girls?
-Yeah, I heard about it.

10:26.112 --> 10:28.611
-Who caught it?
-It ain't ours.

10:29.211 --> 10:32.111
Port police has jurisdiction over Patapsco.

10:32.211 --> 10:35.411
Ain't gonna be a murder either,
so who gives a fuck?

10:35.511 --> 10:38.511
Listen, Jimmy, I ain't got no case on Bird...

10:38.611 --> 10:42.312
unless that crazy motherfucker
Omar testifies. You hear me?

10:43.411 --> 10:45.812
It's time you show Bunk the love.

10:46.111 --> 10:50.112
-You want love, you come and sit on my lap.
-Shit.

10:56.812 --> 10:59.012
This pretty motherfucker
comes over and tells me...

10:59.111 --> 11:01.812
the customs seal got broke on the dock
and I'm responsible.

11:01.912 --> 11:03.312
Can you fucking believe that?

11:03.412 --> 11:06.612
I seen the goddamn thing on the crane,
the seal's already broke.

11:06.712 --> 11:08.012
Who got to it?

11:08.112 --> 11:11.212
The crew probably.
Some goddamn ordinary seamen.

11:11.312 --> 11:13.812
-What was it?
-Vodka, I think.

11:18.012 --> 11:20.212
I ain't saying
we didn't squeeze a case or two...

11:20.312 --> 11:22.912
but fuck it, Frank, the can was already open.

11:23.012 --> 11:26.213
I didn't come to the union hall today
on the back of no bread truck.

11:26.313 --> 11:29.713
I swear, Frank,
we grabbed a couple cases at the end...

11:30.112 --> 11:32.813
after everyone of them
sailor boys damn near raped it.

11:32.913 --> 11:36.712
-A couple of cases?
-Yeah, it was four.

11:39.513 --> 11:43.312
-What the fuck is up with the police?
-What?

11:43.613 --> 11:46.312
They're stroking tickets
on every fucking car.

12:01.012 --> 12:03.313
"Rear tag not entirely visible?"

12:03.913 --> 12:06.013
You got the tow bar set high.

12:07.413 --> 12:09.713
"Emergency access blocked."
Are you kidding me?

12:09.813 --> 12:13.714
We've been parking this side of the building
since the fucking ships had sails.

12:13.813 --> 12:15.913
Come on, pal, what the fuck?

12:17.513 --> 12:20.214
-It ain't me, it's my boss.
-Who's your boss?

12:20.413 --> 12:23.514
-Valchek, Southeast district.
-Stan Valchek?

12:23.613 --> 12:25.713
The district commander, yeah.

12:25.813 --> 12:29.013
That sawed-off piece of shit.
Why the hell is he fucking with us?

12:29.113 --> 12:32.013
Whatever it's about,
you definitely got the man's attention...

12:32.113 --> 12:35.013
'cause word comes down
this morning from my shift lieutenant...

12:35.113 --> 12:38.313
we're to ride past your union hall
twice a day and paper cars.

12:38.413 --> 12:41.414
-You work for a gaping asshole.
-More than one actually.

12:41.513 --> 12:44.713
We're not gonna put up with this shit,
we're gonna go downtown on it.

12:44.813 --> 12:49.314
Take it all the way to the mayor's office,
I can't blame you, but leave me out of it.

12:50.814 --> 12:52.614
It's chain of command.

12:53.414 --> 12:56.414
I mean, I gotta live
with the son of a bitch, too, right?

13:04.314 --> 13:08.214
-You can't tell me this place ain't clean.
-You talk when I say you can.

13:22.214 --> 13:24.614
Who told you to decorate, nigger?

13:28.714 --> 13:31.615
Cell look pretty fucked up to me.
What you calling clean?

13:31.715 --> 13:35.015
-Man, I ain't done shit.
-Don't say that to me, motherfucker!

13:38.315 --> 13:39.815
Pets, too?

13:40.214 --> 13:43.714
No, you see, they plastic,
they got little motors and all, man.

13:47.014 --> 13:49.415
Clean this shit before lock-down.

13:51.414 --> 13:53.515
That's four in a row, bitch!

14:08.115 --> 14:10.415
Wait here, this won't take long.

14:12.715 --> 14:15.415
What do you want from me?
He's an E-rate and you're a "G."

14:15.516 --> 14:18.615
He wants the ship, he gets the ship.
Seniority, Mims, seniority.

14:18.716 --> 14:22.215
-There ain't no union without it, brother.
-Your sweetheart's out there.

14:22.315 --> 14:23.516
Who?

14:25.715 --> 14:28.316
I gotta go, Mims, I got to.

14:36.015 --> 14:38.915
-Kind of empty in here.
-Everyone's working.

14:39.716 --> 14:42.315
-You getting the message?
-The message?

14:42.416 --> 14:46.715
I had people working on a window
for the nave up St. Casmir's since Easter...

14:46.815 --> 14:48.016
you know that?

14:48.116 --> 14:50.616
I took money from half a dozen
different people...

14:50.716 --> 14:52.616
told them where it was gonna go.

14:52.716 --> 14:56.116
-You tell Father Lewandowski?
-I was gonna surprise him.

14:56.216 --> 15:00.216
Yeah, you surprised everybody.
Now there's one window too many, right?

15:00.316 --> 15:02.716
Here's the thing, Father Lew says...

15:02.816 --> 15:06.716
he could take another window
in the rectory on the second floor.

15:07.416 --> 15:10.016
-Good for you.
-No, good for you, Frank.

15:10.416 --> 15:14.716
You don't want my finger in your eye,
you better do what's right here.

15:15.817 --> 15:17.217
What's right?

15:19.616 --> 15:22.416
What's right would be for you
to come down here to my house...

15:22.516 --> 15:25.417
Iike a decent human being
and ask a common courtesy.

15:25.517 --> 15:28.116
But that's not you, it's not your way.

15:28.717 --> 15:30.916
My old man always said
you were a half-ass punk...

15:31.016 --> 15:32.616
over at Holy Redeemer as a kid.

15:32.716 --> 15:36.317
My sister said you were a pain in the ass
pest at all them CYO dances...

15:36.417 --> 15:38.517
where none of the girls
would even look at you.

15:38.616 --> 15:41.617
Damn near everyone at the Point said
when you got your badge...

15:41.717 --> 15:44.917
it was too much for anybody named Valchek
to have a patrolman's drag.

15:45.017 --> 15:48.516
And sure enough, you've been
an official asshole every day since.

15:54.217 --> 15:56.616
Fuck you! And your window!

16:12.217 --> 16:13.417
Where are you gonna be?

16:13.617 --> 16:16.517
I'm gonna go find some lunch
somewhere, maybe.

16:16.717 --> 16:18.817
-Give me an hour, yeah?
-Yeah.

16:23.117 --> 16:25.817
-What the fuck is this?
-A knot.

16:26.717 --> 16:29.017
Why don't you just do bunny ears?

16:30.717 --> 16:32.417
So what else we got?

16:33.017 --> 16:37.117
Medics, clothes, bedrolls, that's it.

16:37.517 --> 16:40.817
-Here's a letter, though.
-A letter? What language?

16:40.917 --> 16:43.917
Who knows?
Same backwards-ass writing, though.

16:44.017 --> 16:47.117
That's like Russian or something,
I'm telling you.

16:48.418 --> 16:51.018
Can't figure the name or the address...

16:51.118 --> 16:53.717
but the stamp says "Magyar" on it.

16:53.818 --> 16:57.118
-Where's Magyar?
-What the hell do I look like, Rand McNally?

16:58.618 --> 17:01.218
Which one of your detectives caught
all the dead girls?

17:01.318 --> 17:03.518
Detectives? They're at the bar already.

17:03.618 --> 17:04.818
These yours?

17:04.917 --> 17:08.818
They chalked it up as an accidental
and dumped the paperwork on us.

17:08.917 --> 17:11.218
She found them, she writes on it.

17:12.018 --> 17:15.117
-I'm McNulty, City Marine Unit.
-Beatrice Russell.

17:15.218 --> 17:19.219
-You got any IDs yet?
-No visas or passports.

17:19.818 --> 17:23.117
A few scraps of paper,
but nothing to make sense of.

17:23.518 --> 17:27.518
Russian alphabet on most of it.
You just curious?

17:27.617 --> 17:29.019
-Yeah.
-Why?

17:30.519 --> 17:33.619
Day before yesterday I fished out a Jane Doe
from near the bridge.

17:33.719 --> 17:36.118
There's no missing person report on file.

17:39.118 --> 17:41.919
We got 14 bedrolls and 13 bodies.

17:44.318 --> 17:47.418
-Mine was a murder.
-A murder, you're kidding me?

17:47.719 --> 17:50.418
We got some photos,
if you wanna take a look.

17:51.619 --> 17:53.119
I called the morgue this morning...

17:53.219 --> 17:55.919
the only thing they can say
is the dental work isn't local.

17:56.019 --> 17:56.519
Overseas, they think.

17:56.519 --> 17:57.519
Overseas, they think.

17:57.819 --> 17:59.919
-Is that your girl?
-Think so.

18:00.719 --> 18:02.319
Looks better here.

18:02.519 --> 18:05.819
You got her in the water,
day before yesterday, out by the bridge?

18:05.919 --> 18:08.619
0900 hours, by the Fort Armistead dock.

18:09.419 --> 18:11.619
Why would you have a murdered girl
in the water...

18:11.719 --> 18:14.419
and the rest of them are suffocating
in a can at Patapsco?

18:14.520 --> 18:17.620
-What went wrong?
-Air pipe up top got crushed.

18:17.720 --> 18:20.719
Happened when cargo shifted around,
most likely.

18:24.220 --> 18:28.519
They had cargo up front of the container
with a false back after about 25 feet.

18:28.619 --> 18:30.219
You had cartons stacked in front...

18:30.320 --> 18:33.520
but a tight passage to a small door
in the false wall...

18:33.620 --> 18:35.520
opens from the outside only.

18:38.920 --> 18:41.920
-They're in here the whole trip?
-Probably not.

18:42.020 --> 18:44.720
Once they're at sea,
there's usually someone in the crew...

18:44.820 --> 18:46.820
who's in on it, you know, a shepherd.

18:46.920 --> 18:50.719
He let's them out to eat, move around,
use the bathroom, whatever.

18:51.920 --> 18:54.520
They were clawing at the wall for air.

18:54.620 --> 18:57.119
That's what the medical examiner
said anyway.

18:58.020 --> 19:02.120
-Where's the air pipe?
-That's the hole. Pipe's up top.

19:04.920 --> 19:06.320
You get a lot of stowaways?

19:06.420 --> 19:09.821
Some. Usually it's Customs
or INS that finds them.

19:10.420 --> 19:14.721
Most are Dominicans or Haitians,
or from that part of the world, anyway.

19:15.320 --> 19:20.220
-Not so much from Europe?
-A bit more since 9l1 1, actually.

19:20.620 --> 19:23.020
I think because people can't get in
on visas anymore...

19:23.120 --> 19:25.420
Iike they used to. There you go.

19:26.420 --> 19:28.320
Usually, if the shepherd is doing his job...

19:28.420 --> 19:31.020
he tries to put a can like this
on bottom of the stack...

19:31.120 --> 19:34.520
so they can pop it and the girls
just walk out on the floor of the hold.

19:34.620 --> 19:36.420
Where was this one?

19:40.521 --> 19:42.221
-Look.
-What?

19:42.820 --> 19:45.620
-That look right to you?
-What do you mean?

19:48.621 --> 19:51.721
-You said you were with the Marine Unit?
-Yeah.

19:51.821 --> 19:55.420
What does the Marine Unit have to do
with a bunch of dead girls in a can?

19:55.520 --> 19:56.821
Not a thing.

19:59.621 --> 20:01.021
What do you want me to do?

20:01.121 --> 20:05.521
You can go to Father Lew,
ask him to give Sobotka back his money.

20:05.621 --> 20:07.121
Switch the windows, maybe.

20:07.221 --> 20:10.521
You ever in your life
seen a priest give money back?

20:10.621 --> 20:13.421
The guy pays for a window,
he gets a window.

20:13.521 --> 20:15.021
I thought you had suction.

20:15.121 --> 20:17.721
At City Hall, I got suction.
Down Annapolis, I got suction.

20:17.821 --> 20:21.721
But who but the Pope has any drag
with the cardinal? Get over it.

20:21.821 --> 20:23.821
How the fuck's he get
that kind of money anyway?

20:23.921 --> 20:26.022
Now, that's a good question.

20:27.321 --> 20:31.221
I mean, the whole l.B.S.
can't have 1,500 guys left in this town...

20:31.321 --> 20:33.822
and there ain't 100 checkers.

20:33.922 --> 20:36.121
They got the car ships coming in...

20:36.221 --> 20:39.321
the roll-onlroll-off cargo
is keeping them afloat.

20:40.122 --> 20:42.621
-That's all they got?
-Pretty much.

20:43.722 --> 20:46.622
Past six months,
l.B.S. hired Bruce Dibiago's people...

20:46.722 --> 20:48.822
to lobby for them down in Annapolis.

20:48.922 --> 20:51.422
They've been good
with the political contributions.

20:51.522 --> 20:53.222
They're throwing around a lot of cash.

20:53.322 --> 20:55.222
-How can they?
-You tell me.

20:55.322 --> 20:59.522
Dibiago does not come cheap.
This is real money we're talking.

21:00.122 --> 21:02.121
You know what I think?

21:02.722 --> 21:05.422
I think Francis Sobotka's into some dirt.

21:06.422 --> 21:08.922
You're the cop, not me.

21:15.022 --> 21:16.523
The Grainery?

21:18.322 --> 21:21.922
So I hear Burrell's gonna be
the next police commissioner.

21:22.322 --> 21:23.822
Yeah, I've seen worse.

21:33.022 --> 21:37.023
See, if it's crushed by another container,
it should've been one single movement...

21:37.123 --> 21:39.722
maybe two if something shifts,
and then shifts back again.

21:39.822 --> 21:43.122
This looks like someone has been pounding
on it in a bunch of spots.

21:43.222 --> 21:44.322
See?

21:44.923 --> 21:48.423
Before I rule it, I wanna go down
with a metallurgist to be sure.

21:48.823 --> 21:51.523
But yeah, from the look of it...

21:52.123 --> 21:56.423
you just bought yourself 13 homicides.
Congratulations.

22:00.223 --> 22:03.822
If the commissioner
goes down to Washington, it's you, right?

22:03.923 --> 22:07.723
That's for the mayor to decide.
I'd have to clear the council, too.

22:07.823 --> 22:10.423
If the mayor wants you,
that's not much of a problem.

22:10.523 --> 22:14.023
You been around as long as me,
you make a few enemies.

22:14.123 --> 22:17.323
What, the First District guys?
They're not gonna start nothing.

22:17.523 --> 22:20.623
-They're pushing Shipley.
-See, that's racist.

22:21.223 --> 22:25.123
You know, it personally offends me
that anybody would reach down past you...

22:25.223 --> 22:28.923
to elevate some colonel
just because he happens to be white.

22:30.123 --> 22:31.224
You know what I'm gonna do?

22:31.324 --> 22:34.124
I'm gonna get on the phone
and call my friends at the Hall.

22:34.224 --> 22:36.723
That'll bring the First District in line.

22:36.823 --> 22:38.223
That's very kind.

22:38.323 --> 22:42.224
And what if anything is there
that I can do for you, Maj. Valchek?

22:43.524 --> 22:46.223
Funny you should ask. I need a detail.

22:46.824 --> 22:50.923
CID people mostly, though I can spare
some bodies out of my district, too.

22:51.023 --> 22:52.024
What for?

22:52.224 --> 22:56.023
I got some guys in the Southeast
that are showing a lot of money.

22:56.124 --> 22:58.324
-Port guys, longshoremen.
-I.B.S.?

22:58.424 --> 23:00.924
I'm not talking about going after
the whole union.

23:01.124 --> 23:03.524
Just a couple of guys in one local
that look fat.

23:03.624 --> 23:06.024
Drugs, maybe, or the usual thieving.

23:06.724 --> 23:09.424
-Frank Sobotka, you heard the name?
-No.

23:09.924 --> 23:13.124
And I'm not saying the problem
even goes past him.

23:13.525 --> 23:16.624
-What's he to you?
-To me?

23:18.425 --> 23:19.925
He's an asshole.

23:24.524 --> 23:26.525
Six men for six weeks.

23:27.024 --> 23:28.724
Rawls will pick them.

23:32.024 --> 23:34.024
You ordered more than you ate.

23:38.624 --> 23:40.324
It's cold out here.

23:43.524 --> 23:47.325
Cedric, I shouldn't have brought it up again,
I'm sorry.

23:53.825 --> 23:56.925
You're right. You're always right.

23:58.025 --> 24:00.625
I'm just saying you have to be realistic.

24:00.824 --> 24:04.024
You did what you did,
and now you are where you are.

24:05.425 --> 24:06.725
In the basement.

24:09.125 --> 24:12.925
If they buried you any deeper,
you'd be under the damn building.

24:13.025 --> 24:14.325
Burrell won't be there forever.

24:14.425 --> 24:18.526
Burrell is going to be the next
police commissioner, and you know it.

24:19.325 --> 24:20.925
But you've got the law degree.

24:21.025 --> 24:25.425
With your police experience, half a dozen
firms would think you're a prize.

24:25.525 --> 24:27.225
You've got options.

24:29.025 --> 24:31.326
-Just because they don't--
-You're right.

24:38.725 --> 24:40.425
I'll put in my papers.

24:55.126 --> 24:58.026
-Who wants breakfast?
-Christ, it's about time.

24:58.126 --> 25:00.626
Lucky's was closed.
I had to go to the metro.

25:00.925 --> 25:04.926
I thought Mutt be working North Point
today. He like them Ro-ro ships.

25:05.126 --> 25:08.826
No, his wife is having some kind of
operation, so he gave back his hours.

25:08.926 --> 25:11.726
-Who got them?
-New Charles works for Mutt.

25:12.227 --> 25:14.326
Yo, Zig. You working today?

25:14.426 --> 25:18.226
No, came down here to have breakfast
with you duper-faced fucks.

25:18.326 --> 25:21.026
Most important goddamn meal
of the goddamn day, right?

25:21.126 --> 25:25.227
-Set them up, Dolores, Zig is thirsty.
-That's right, I'm thirsty.

25:27.126 --> 25:30.226
You know what?
Bottoms up, you ugly whores.

25:44.327 --> 25:46.227
-Nick.
-What's up?

25:47.427 --> 25:48.727
Come here.

25:52.727 --> 25:55.927
-I got a line on something.
-Oh, yeah?

25:56.127 --> 25:58.827
You know White Mike
from down Curtis Bay?

25:59.426 --> 26:03.327
-He's gonna stake me to a package.
-A package?

26:06.527 --> 26:08.127
Dope, Nicky, dope.

26:10.127 --> 26:11.427
I got work today, Zig.

26:11.527 --> 26:15.327
Yeah, and I'm gonna make as much money
not working. You see what I'm saying?

26:15.428 --> 26:19.227
-So why the fuck you coming to me?
-I want you to come in on it with me.

26:19.327 --> 26:23.027
You bring a little cash as money down,
my man might give us a bigger package.

26:23.127 --> 26:25.028
We turn it around, we both get paid.

26:25.128 --> 26:27.427
All right, ship's in, gentlemen.

26:27.927 --> 26:30.427
-Fuck that shit, Zig.
-Time to work!

26:31.728 --> 26:34.127
-Nicky, come on, man.
-Can I ride with you?

26:35.927 --> 26:37.828
Will you think about it?

26:40.727 --> 26:43.028
Dolores, can I get another shot?

27:10.528 --> 27:13.028
-What's up?
-DWI checkpoint.

27:13.128 --> 27:15.528
Step out of the car for a Breathalyzer.

27:18.628 --> 27:21.028
It's 8:00 in the goddamn morning.

27:22.229 --> 27:24.928
Who the fuck gets drunk
at 8:00 in the morning?

27:30.528 --> 27:33.928
Bill, I'm not arguing
that the jurisdiction's not technically ours.

27:34.028 --> 27:38.229
Patapsco's definitely Port Authority property
and the Port Police have the jurisdiction.

27:38.329 --> 27:39.929
-That's not in dispute here.
-Good.

27:40.029 --> 27:42.328
But they're not equipped
for a death investigation.

27:42.428 --> 27:45.729
You dump 13 bodies on them,
you're dumping them on us.

27:45.829 --> 27:49.129
MSP is gonna have to pick up that slack,
overburdened as we are.

27:49.229 --> 27:52.929
Robbie, I have fought and scratched
and clawed for four months...

27:53.029 --> 27:55.329
to get my clearance rate up above 50%...

27:55.429 --> 27:58.429
and right now, it stands at exactly 51.6%.

27:58.629 --> 28:01.029
Do you happen to know
what my clearance rate will be...

28:01.129 --> 28:02.928
if I take 13 whodunits off your hands?

28:03.029 --> 28:06.429
-39.4%.
-Bill, like I told you--

28:07.129 --> 28:10.930
We did not get to be colonels
by being complete fucking idiots, right?

28:13.029 --> 28:17.029
Robbie, you poor bastard,
you look like you need a cup of coffee.

29:06.630 --> 29:08.430
The man is a god.

29:21.130 --> 29:22.630
Big chief.

29:23.931 --> 29:27.131
I gotta get him back to maximum security
by 6:00, all right?

29:27.231 --> 29:29.130
Yeah. Come on in, man.

29:31.831 --> 29:34.630
Here, sit down.
Fix yourself something to eat, man.

29:34.730 --> 29:37.330
-No, man, I ain't hungry, I ate.
-What?

29:37.730 --> 29:40.131
You crazy, this is good shit, man.

29:40.231 --> 29:42.330
-Better get in this.
-No.

29:46.031 --> 29:47.030
Look, man...

29:48.531 --> 29:50.831
if he tearing your room down, man...

29:50.931 --> 29:52.931
we keep bringing more stuff in.

29:53.031 --> 29:56.331
It's gonna get so he can't tear it down
fast enough. You feel me?

29:56.431 --> 29:58.330
He fucked with my fish though, I don't....

29:58.931 --> 30:00.531
He ain't have to go there, man.

30:00.631 --> 30:04.231
-What's up with this motherfucker?
-You remember Ladontay?

30:05.131 --> 30:06.431
Burner from over the Poe Homes?

30:06.531 --> 30:09.031
Caught him over at Carver parking lot
after school?

30:09.231 --> 30:10.731
We did that?

30:10.831 --> 30:13.731
Tilghman was Ladontay's cousin
or some such.

30:13.831 --> 30:17.331
He found out I ate the charge,
he busting my chops.

30:17.431 --> 30:20.631
Ladontay? I can't even remember that one.

30:21.231 --> 30:23.932
You need a scorecard
to keep up with your lethal ass.

30:24.032 --> 30:26.431
Avon, he fixing to stay in my shit.

30:26.931 --> 30:29.731
Listen. I'm gonna talk to him, all right?

30:29.831 --> 30:32.931
I'm gonna set it straight. All right?

30:33.332 --> 30:37.331
-What's his name again?
-Tilghman, he work the dayshift on J-tier.

30:38.432 --> 30:39.932
I seen him around.

30:40.032 --> 30:42.832
Man, all these CO's are fronting and shit.

30:42.932 --> 30:45.232
You got the guards bringing your meals in.

30:45.332 --> 30:48.532
This punk motherfucker Tilghman
running around acting righteous...

30:48.632 --> 30:51.832
but he bringing shit in here,
steady slinging on the side.

30:51.931 --> 30:54.232
Don't fret. All right?

30:54.832 --> 30:58.032
It's nothing. I'm gonna take care of it.

30:59.632 --> 31:00.732
The city won't take it?

31:00.832 --> 31:04.032
No, it's Port Authority property.
It's state jurisdiction.

31:04.132 --> 31:06.032
So it's MSP out of Pikesville.

31:06.132 --> 31:08.332
Case needs real murder police.

31:08.732 --> 31:11.232
You don't give a shit.
Just wanna fuck Rawls, don't you?

31:11.432 --> 31:13.332
Absolutely. What can you give me?

31:13.432 --> 31:18.132
-This is about fucking over your boss?
-If they don't eat the cases, then you will.

31:18.632 --> 31:20.132
What do you need?

31:20.232 --> 31:22.932
First of all,
how big was the false compartment?

31:26.332 --> 31:28.432
13 by 7 by 7.

31:29.233 --> 31:33.633
Okay, we got 13 adult females,
breathing at a normal to elevated rate...

31:36.332 --> 31:40.533
that's 0.25 liters of oxygen per minute...

31:40.732 --> 31:41.833
per victim.

31:42.732 --> 31:45.533
-He's a doctor?
-A State Bureau of Mines.

31:45.632 --> 31:47.833
-Minds?
-Mines.

32:01.933 --> 32:05.133
Officer Tilghman,
could I parlay with you for a moment?

32:05.233 --> 32:06.833
-Barksdale, right?
-Yeah.

32:07.133 --> 32:10.133
-Listen, I want to know if you can help me--
-No.

32:10.633 --> 32:13.833
-Pardon me?
-I said, no, motherfucker.

32:18.034 --> 32:19.534
Off the steps.

32:44.734 --> 32:47.034
What the fuck are you up to now?

32:53.634 --> 32:57.034
You're deep into somebody's shit, McNulty.
I can tell.

33:01.834 --> 33:03.633
This is bullshit.

33:03.734 --> 33:05.134
Those computations were checked...

33:05.234 --> 33:07.434
and confirmed by
the medical examiner's office.

33:07.534 --> 33:10.534
They're accurate for time of death
to within a three-hour window.

33:10.634 --> 33:11.934
Yeah, so you say.

33:12.034 --> 33:15.034
Your man in the Marine Unit
did the measurements on the container.

33:15.134 --> 33:17.834
I happen to know my man
in the Marine Unit intimately...

33:17.935 --> 33:20.534
and he's, without a doubt,
the most swollen asshole...

33:20.634 --> 33:22.835
in American law enforcement.

33:22.935 --> 33:26.334
I am not eating 13 murders. No, sir.

33:27.635 --> 33:30.334
If they were already dead
when the container hit the dock...

33:30.434 --> 33:32.034
then they were murdered on board ship.

33:32.135 --> 33:33.735
That means Baltimore County...

33:33.835 --> 33:36.134
or Anne Arundel
on the other side of the bridge...

33:36.234 --> 33:40.335
and if they're further down the bay, then you
fellows with the Coast Guard can take it.

33:40.435 --> 33:42.535
This is not a city problem.

33:45.135 --> 33:48.435
Talk amongst yourselves.
One of you is taking this case home tonight.

33:48.535 --> 33:49.635
No, Bill.

33:49.835 --> 33:52.434
The Atlantic Light passed the Key Bridge
at 2300 hours...

33:52.634 --> 33:55.535
and laid up at anchor,
2,000 yards off Patapsco...

33:55.634 --> 33:58.235
until 0600 hours, when it docked.

33:58.735 --> 34:03.035
-By the map, that's Baltimore city.
-And that put the ship in your jurisdiction...

34:03.135 --> 34:06.235
for the three-hour window
for the time of death.

34:08.935 --> 34:11.935
Bill, you look like
you could use a good cup of coffee.

34:59.135 --> 35:00.236
Mikey.

35:00.336 --> 35:01.836
-What's up?
-No.

35:02.436 --> 35:03.436
No, what?

35:03.536 --> 35:05.436
No way, you little rat-faced piece of shit.

35:05.536 --> 35:07.736
You fucked up the last two packages
I gave you.

35:07.836 --> 35:10.136
Mikey, look man, that wasn't me.

35:10.536 --> 35:12.636
You got money, Zig,
you can buy a little weight.

35:12.836 --> 35:15.336
You got no money, go fuck yourself.

35:16.236 --> 35:18.437
Mike, I thought we was friends.

35:18.536 --> 35:21.136
Did you fuck up the last two packages?

35:22.136 --> 35:24.236
-Sort of.
-Are you beat to shit?

35:25.036 --> 35:27.236
-No.
-Take a walk, my friend.

35:57.137 --> 35:59.337
-What's up, man?
-What's up, playboy?

36:01.737 --> 36:04.737
That thing in Atlanta, settled for now.

36:04.837 --> 36:06.737
So we got that, you know.

36:06.837 --> 36:09.337
Good. I ain't call you down for that, man.

36:09.537 --> 36:12.637
Called you down here 'cause we got a CO
in here with some bullshit.

36:12.737 --> 36:14.637
-Who?
-Name is Tilghman.

36:14.737 --> 36:18.338
He kin to that boy that Wee-Bey
dusted down over in that school lot.

36:18.737 --> 36:20.737
He can't let go of that shit, neither.

36:20.837 --> 36:23.038
Tilghman? Right.

36:24.137 --> 36:27.737
Listen, Brianna reminded me, man.
We got promises we got to keep.

36:27.838 --> 36:29.438
I know, I heard.

36:34.338 --> 36:36.537
You need to get with Dee's girl.

36:36.637 --> 36:38.838
Have her bring that young one
down here regular.

36:38.938 --> 36:41.238
She need to step up
and do her fucking part.

36:41.337 --> 36:42.638
All right.

36:44.937 --> 36:46.637
How's Dee taking it?

36:46.838 --> 36:49.837
I mean, he gonna do
what need to be done, man.

36:49.938 --> 36:53.238
You know what I'm saying?
Dee need a little help every now and again.

36:53.338 --> 36:55.638
You're not out of reach
or nothing like that, right?

36:55.738 --> 36:58.838
-No, nothing like that.
-You sure?

37:00.138 --> 37:04.438
-He's carrying a lot of weight for us, man.
-Stringer, he's family, man.

37:04.938 --> 37:07.338
All right? He's family.

37:10.138 --> 37:13.338
Come on, Jimmy. Take it to the head, baby.

37:15.038 --> 37:17.738
Come on. Tell her you were first in line.

37:19.738 --> 37:20.738
That's it.

37:20.838 --> 37:21.939
There it is.

37:23.638 --> 37:25.538
-One more, baby, come on.
-There you go.

37:25.638 --> 37:27.638
-That's enough.
-No.

37:28.139 --> 37:30.438
You gotta do all 14 of them bad boys...

37:30.538 --> 37:33.938
one for every member of the dear family
you gave to Cole.

37:35.238 --> 37:39.239
Here's to Ray Cole, a fine detective,
and a goodly man.

37:43.039 --> 37:46.538
Jimmy, the look on Jay Landsman's face.
He nearly fucking cried.

37:47.739 --> 37:49.439
And Rawls!

37:50.139 --> 37:53.739
Rawls, I swear to God,
the man stayed in his office all day.

37:53.839 --> 37:57.539
All afternoon.
He just stayed there with the door closed.

37:58.239 --> 38:02.739
-Careful, you're giving me an erection.
-Come on now.

38:02.839 --> 38:06.339
Motherfucker, you have outdone yourself
this time.

38:06.939 --> 38:09.739
You ain't never coming back from this,
you know that.

38:09.839 --> 38:12.839
Lester, what the fuck can they do to me
they haven't done?

38:12.939 --> 38:14.839
I'm riding the goddamn boat.

38:17.939 --> 38:21.239
Fuck it, I don't give a shit.
Here's to Jane Doe 13.

38:24.840 --> 38:26.139
All right.

38:26.540 --> 38:29.840
Eleven more years of whatever bullshit
they throw at me.

38:30.439 --> 38:33.440
I'm gonna put in my papers,
take the pension and walk.

38:35.239 --> 38:37.740
Eleven's a long time to be on the shelf.

38:38.839 --> 38:41.040
Tell me about it, Mr. 13 years.

38:41.140 --> 38:42.740
And four months.

38:45.840 --> 38:47.040
Fuck it.

38:48.040 --> 38:50.740
Chew you up, they gotta spit you back out.

38:54.639 --> 38:55.540
-Fourteen.
-He did it.

38:55.540 --> 38:57.939
-Fourteen.
-He did it.

38:58.340 --> 38:59.340
Fuck.

39:01.540 --> 39:04.240
Easy, motherfucker,
I ain't picking up that shit.

39:04.340 --> 39:05.640
Go that way.

39:08.640 --> 39:11.040
-Man, anybody still in there?
-They're keeping La-la.

39:11.140 --> 39:13.640
He had an old warrant on him.

39:13.740 --> 39:17.740
-For what?
-I don't know. Some traffic shit, man.

39:18.340 --> 39:21.140
The bondsman's inside,
trying to get it all figured out.

39:21.240 --> 39:24.140
Man, what the fuck
was this all about anyway?

39:24.240 --> 39:27.940
-Jerking us around on the way to work.
-It's a beef I got with a police boss.

39:28.040 --> 39:32.040
-Charlie Valchek's little pissant brother.
-You gotta get that taken care of, man.

39:32.240 --> 39:35.740
-I mean, this shit is out of hand.
-I'm gonna take care of it.

39:36.441 --> 39:38.441
Yeah, y'all need a lift?

39:39.941 --> 39:42.541
-I'll see you.
-All right, talk to you.

39:44.041 --> 39:46.541
That runt wants a war, he's got one.

39:50.741 --> 39:53.140
Not supposed to be talking anyway.

39:54.541 --> 39:57.241
-Bunk, Lester.
-Yeah.

40:00.541 --> 40:03.341
You two winners are on the Jane Does.

40:03.541 --> 40:05.541
What? We're not up, Jay.

40:05.941 --> 40:08.341
We caught that double in Pimlico last week.

40:08.441 --> 40:10.141
Cole's gonna take the double.

40:10.241 --> 40:13.541
-You two got pussy in a can.
-Jay, that ain't right.

40:13.841 --> 40:15.842
You know what ain't right?

40:16.241 --> 40:20.542
Our squad has a negative clearance rate
for the year. A negative rate.

40:27.741 --> 40:31.241
Now, I'm not saying
Ray Cole isn't a good detective.

40:32.841 --> 40:35.242
But I need those 14 cases to go black...

40:35.342 --> 40:37.641
so I got my best people on it.

40:39.742 --> 40:40.741
Ray.

40:46.142 --> 40:47.742
Lay it on them.

40:47.842 --> 40:51.342
Name and number of the port cop
who processed the scene.

40:53.042 --> 40:56.842
And the best of luck to you
in all your future endeavors, Detectives.

40:57.142 --> 40:58.442
Motherfucker.

40:59.542 --> 41:02.242
Beatrice Russell. She pretty at least?

41:09.942 --> 41:14.042
Last night, you're too drunk to fuck.
Today, you're too hung over.

41:18.842 --> 41:21.542
What's the most useless thing on a woman?

41:21.642 --> 41:24.242
-What?
-A drunken lrishman.

41:26.442 --> 41:29.042
But you're not really lrish, are you?

41:29.542 --> 41:32.442
I had 14 shots of Jameson.
How's that for green?

41:32.542 --> 41:34.442
You're green, all right.

41:35.443 --> 41:38.443
You're also an idiot. Who does 14 shots?

41:40.642 --> 41:42.643
You're a child, McNulty.

41:49.843 --> 41:52.743
Show up at my door at 2:00 a.m. again
without invitation...

41:52.843 --> 41:55.943
-I will call the cops.
-Why would you wanna do that?

41:58.643 --> 41:59.743
Jimmy.

42:03.443 --> 42:07.843
Am I your girlfriend? No. Your wife? No.
Your soul mate? No.

42:09.243 --> 42:11.343
What the fuck am l, Jimmy?

42:12.243 --> 42:13.943
We're good together.

42:21.343 --> 42:23.043
Answer the question.

42:27.244 --> 42:28.744
I've been pretty honest with you.

42:28.844 --> 42:32.743
My wife wants to put it back together again,
I'm gonna go for it, right?

42:33.544 --> 42:36.343
You know, what with the kids and all....

42:45.543 --> 42:47.243
You got any aspirin?

42:48.643 --> 42:51.644
For Christ's sake, Ronnie, I'm dying in here.

44:06.945 --> 44:10.045
A real police department
would have an elevator.

44:14.145 --> 44:16.645
So you Russell? Bunk Moreland.

44:17.645 --> 44:19.145
Lester Freamon.

44:19.546 --> 44:23.245
I'm still on hold with the Coast Guard,
Delaware River Detachment.

44:23.345 --> 44:24.645
What do we know?

44:24.745 --> 44:28.846
Atlantic Light is in Philly,
heading for Port of Elizabeth tonight.

44:28.946 --> 44:32.346
-I'm trying to get them to hold her.
-Anyone from your CID working this?

44:32.446 --> 44:35.646
Nope. I heard there's a big argument
over jurisdiction...

44:35.746 --> 44:37.945
and your colonel made everybody mad.

44:38.045 --> 44:41.045
-All you get is me.
-Still on hold?

44:43.246 --> 44:45.645
We can call this in from the road.

44:50.745 --> 44:52.546
You're with City Homicide?

44:52.646 --> 44:55.846
-You must know Jimmy McNulty.
-Yeah, he's dead to us.

45:17.046 --> 45:19.547
Gentlemen, make yourselves at home.

45:19.647 --> 45:20.846
I've seen worse.

45:20.946 --> 45:24.347
It's leased by the Highway Authority,
but we can use it for an off-site.

45:24.447 --> 45:26.646
-Furnace work?
-It does.

45:26.746 --> 45:28.246
And the phone lines.

45:28.346 --> 45:31.746
You'll need window units
if you're here come summer...

45:31.846 --> 45:33.346
but somehow I got a feeling...

45:33.446 --> 45:37.047
that you gents will put together a case
quicker than that.

45:37.347 --> 45:38.947
Now, this here...

45:39.446 --> 45:43.347
is my district investigator,
Roland Pryzbylewski.

45:43.447 --> 45:48.047
Kid's a prodigy.
Anything you need from me, you go to him.

45:49.046 --> 45:53.047
Gentlemen, the target is Frank Sobotka...

45:53.147 --> 45:55.947
and anyone Frank Sobotka
does his dirt with.

45:56.347 --> 45:59.647
Roland will fill you in on the details.
Good hunting.

46:03.947 --> 46:06.247
So who signs the overtime slips?

46:12.647 --> 46:15.147
Son of a bitch.
You are a fucking thief, aren't you?

46:15.247 --> 46:17.647
-This is where our taxes go.
-I do good work, don't l?

46:17.747 --> 46:19.347
Let's get it on the fucking can now.

46:19.447 --> 46:21.348
Horseface, you son of a bitch.

46:25.247 --> 46:28.047
Christ, I'm gonna bust the only nut I got left.

46:28.747 --> 46:31.947
Ain't no heavier than the pallets
we usually handle.

46:34.148 --> 46:35.948
Finishing touch, boys.

46:52.547 --> 46:53.848
Bon voyage.

47:01.848 --> 47:03.348
There she goes.

47:16.248 --> 47:19.749
This area's restricted. Yes, sir, no problem.

47:41.548 --> 47:44.748
-Amir, why don't we sail?
-They're holding the ship.

47:44.848 --> 47:46.849
-Who?
-Coast Guard, the Americans.

47:46.949 --> 47:47.948
Why?

49:15.750 --> 49:18.250
Fuck, Sergei, you almost break my hand.

49:19.951 --> 49:21.350
Bring him up!

49:42.551 --> 49:45.251
-Have a good day, Officer.
-Okay, I'll see you.

50:00.551 --> 50:01.651
Now get up in there.

50:01.751 --> 50:03.951
Last call before lock-down.

50:06.151 --> 50:08.051
Make it snappy now.

50:11.451 --> 50:14.751
-How you like that?
-It's good, baby, it's beautiful.

50:16.051 --> 50:17.551
Nice. Smooth.

50:17.651 --> 50:19.051
Most def, man.

50:23.352 --> 50:25.851
Man, watch your back, be good, baby.

50:28.352 --> 50:31.552
-What up, man?
-Yeah, he left that in here.

50:33.152 --> 50:34.352
It's his.

50:34.552 --> 50:38.152
-So how you doing?
-All right.

50:38.651 --> 50:39.752
Yeah?

50:42.051 --> 50:44.252
Me and you gonna need to talk.

51:21.452 --> 51:25.353
-So who's on board?
-Thirty-eight in the crew, 14 are Yemeni.

51:25.452 --> 51:26.753
Eight are Sri Lankan.

51:26.853 --> 51:30.752
There are five Filipinos and the rest
are from here, there, and back again.

51:32.052 --> 51:35.252
-Anybody speak English?
-What you're asking them about...

51:35.352 --> 51:38.253
I'll be amazed if any of them
manages a word.

51:40.652 --> 51:43.552
-Where's your captain?
-At the Coast Guard office.

51:43.652 --> 51:46.952
Angry as hell because we're due
on a New Jersey pier tomorrow morning.

51:47.053 --> 51:48.452
You ain't gonna make it.

51:48.552 --> 51:53.052
I gotta tell you, every day that you hold us
costs the shipping agent $100,000.

51:53.252 --> 51:57.453
-The Atlantic Light is a huge enterprise.
-The Atlantic Light is a crime scene.

51:59.153 --> 52:01.252
Don't try to play tough guy.

52:02.753 --> 52:05.353
I'm not the one getting my ass kicked.

52:05.753 --> 52:07.053
Talk to me!

52:10.553 --> 52:13.253
Tell me what I need to know.

52:17.953 --> 52:19.153
Get him up.

52:22.953 --> 52:26.754
-Talk about the girls.
-No girls, nothing.

52:27.054 --> 52:28.454
No English.

52:28.754 --> 52:31.754
You no speak English,
but you know how to run?

52:35.054 --> 52:36.854
Why you run from ship?

52:40.054 --> 52:43.154
What the fuck that suppose to mean?

52:47.354 --> 52:48.754
They got him in Philadelphia.

52:48.854 --> 52:52.054
He jumped when he found out
the Coast Guard was gonna hold the ship.

52:52.154 --> 52:56.054
-What is he?
-Sergei says he looks like an Arab.

53:07.755 --> 53:09.554
He don't know nothing.

53:10.754 --> 53:13.054
But you kept hitting him anyway.

53:13.654 --> 53:15.254
Get his clothes.

53:26.054 --> 53:28.555
If you don't mind, I'm gonna have one.

53:47.855 --> 53:51.455
-Come on, let's talk.
-No English.

53:52.655 --> 53:54.755
Tell me what happened to the girls?

53:58.555 --> 54:00.155
No speak.

54:00.355 --> 54:03.054
What then? What do you speak?

54:04.955 --> 54:07.055
Come on, talk to me, friend.

54:25.155 --> 54:26.455
Turkish?

54:26.856 --> 54:29.255
You got that little hook on your nose.

54:31.756 --> 54:33.556
Don't worry, patrioti.

54:34.155 --> 54:38.556
I got nothing against the Turks.
That's the old world. This is the new.

54:43.556 --> 54:45.256
Sam.

54:46.656 --> 54:49.356
-I don't know nothing about--
-You know.

54:49.856 --> 54:54.156
And you're going to tell me about it, too.
After that...

54:54.656 --> 54:56.956
you're done, I give you my word.

55:04.656 --> 55:07.456
We popped the can to let them take a bath.

55:08.156 --> 55:09.856
Get some fresh air.

55:12.056 --> 55:16.556
You gotta understand, my crew,
they pulling on their pootsos for weeks.

55:17.856 --> 55:20.456
These girls, they looked pretty good.

55:21.956 --> 55:24.356
-Katalavenis?
-Yes.

55:25.457 --> 55:27.457
The men had cash to spend.

55:29.057 --> 55:32.057
I admit it, I saw chance for business,
but that was all.

55:32.157 --> 55:33.657
What happened?

55:34.456 --> 55:38.557
One of the puttanas decided
she didn't want to be a puttana no more.

55:38.757 --> 55:42.356
This one guy got rough with her.
The whore died.

55:43.457 --> 55:46.357
The other ones saw.
I didn't know what to do.

55:46.757 --> 55:51.357
-You kill one, then you kill them all.
-No, that was another man.

55:51.457 --> 55:53.357
Another man, what man?

55:54.257 --> 55:55.757
The one girl...

55:56.557 --> 55:58.357
they saw, they knew.

56:08.057 --> 56:09.257
Relax.

56:10.657 --> 56:12.357
I gave you my word.

56:33.958 --> 56:37.957
-Watch your shoes.
-Goddamn Turko.

56:38.858 --> 56:40.558
Bleeds like a lamb.

56:44.257 --> 56:47.457
In a year, each whore would bring
a quarter million. What is it?

56:47.658 --> 56:49.358
$4 million.

56:49.658 --> 56:50.657
Gone.

56:51.658 --> 56:52.758
Malaka.

56:54.258 --> 56:56.658
Anyway, there will be other girls.

56:59.758 --> 57:01.058
This one...

57:01.658 --> 57:03.158
no fingerprints.

57:04.258 --> 57:07.058
-No face.
-That's not a problem.
