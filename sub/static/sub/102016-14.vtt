WEBVTT

00:00.584 --> 00:06.089
Hey there.

00:06.089 --> 00:08.008
I'd introduce myself,
but it doesn't really matter.

00:08.008 --> 00:11.053
What does is that there's
this problem

00:11.053 --> 00:13.639
I've been trying to solve
for the longest time,

00:13.639 --> 00:16.600
and inspiration has
finally struck.

00:16.600 --> 00:21.355
Uh, I mean,
I could be going crazy.

00:21.355 --> 00:25.400
I've definitely been accused
of that before.

00:25.400 --> 00:27.402
But this artifact, I think,
is telling me

00:27.402 --> 00:31.281
you're the one who can help me.

00:34.952 --> 00:37.037
But trust me, I get it.

00:37.037 --> 00:39.957
Why the hell would you help me?

00:39.957 --> 00:42.459
Well, for starters,
and speaking from experience,

00:42.459 --> 00:45.754
I don't think anyone deserves
to be thrown in a dark hole

00:45.754 --> 00:48.757
and forgotten about.

00:48.757 --> 00:50.133
Last, but not least,

00:50.133 --> 00:51.969
I'll get you out of here
if you do.

00:51.969 --> 00:55.430
Hmm?

00:58.308 --> 00:59.059
<i>Bravo!</i>

01:01.728 --> 01:04.940
Next up, Father Capulet,

01:04.940 --> 01:07.776
as portrayed by Wade Rivers.

01:13.448 --> 01:14.449
And don't forget
my scene partner,

01:14.449 --> 01:16.493
the Tribrid, as Tybalt.

01:16.493 --> 01:19.162
If we can find her.

01:22.583 --> 01:22.916
A dramatic entrance, indeed.

01:25.502 --> 01:29.131
Looks like I'm not late enough.

01:29.131 --> 01:30.340
Come now, you don't wish to let

01:30.340 --> 01:33.051
your scene partner down,

01:33.051 --> 01:34.803
do you, Ms. Mikaelson?
You know,

01:34.803 --> 01:36.138
life is really just a series
of disappointments,

01:36.138 --> 01:38.557
so that's a
better lesson

01:38.557 --> 01:40.517
than Shakespeare.
I understand
you're going

01:40.517 --> 01:41.977
through a rough patch.
Well, I feel like if
you understood that,

01:41.977 --> 01:44.563
you'd probably get
why I don't really

01:44.563 --> 01:46.315
want to dramatize the story
of undying teenage love.

01:46.315 --> 01:48.442
You know,
especially when it

01:48.442 --> 01:49.902
does end with dying,

01:49.902 --> 01:51.278
and then not dying,

01:51.278 --> 01:53.488
and then him ditching you anyway

01:53.488 --> 01:54.990
when he promised nothing
would ever come between you two.

02:02.748 --> 02:07.669
And scene.

02:07.669 --> 02:10.047
<i>You two have gotten close,</i>

02:10.047 --> 02:11.590
at least from what I've
seen around school.

02:11.590 --> 02:13.383
We have History together--

02:13.383 --> 02:15.427
uh, capital-H History--
and Gym,

02:15.427 --> 02:17.179
but we're not friends
or anything like that.

02:17.179 --> 02:20.474
Hey, Dr. Saltzman.
I'm sorry I can't help,

02:20.474 --> 02:21.892
Mr. Williams, but if I see MG,
I'll definitely let you know.

02:21.892 --> 02:25.062
Yeah.

02:25.062 --> 02:25.646
I had MG compel Ethan
to steer clear of him weeks ago.

02:28.732 --> 02:32.069
Those two
should not be hanging out.

02:32.069 --> 02:33.654
Yeah, Ethan said they're not,
so I doubt that's the reason

02:33.654 --> 02:35.656
MG has skipped school
the last three days.

02:35.656 --> 02:37.115
You get that
locator spell done?

02:37.115 --> 02:39.326
Great.

02:39.326 --> 02:40.744
Let's see.

02:41.954 --> 02:42.746
I don't like that look.

02:46.625 --> 02:49.378
Old habits die hard,

02:49.378 --> 02:51.713
so I keep up with any reports
of animal attacks in the area.

02:51.713 --> 02:54.299
That's a good way to keep
a lookout for Malivore monsters.

02:54.299 --> 02:57.469
Except...

02:57.469 --> 02:58.470
a hiker was found dead
in Grove Hill last night.

02:58.470 --> 03:00.931
Suspiciously close

03:00.931 --> 03:03.559
to right where MG is now.

03:03.559 --> 03:05.602
Wait, do you think
something happened to him?

03:05.602 --> 03:06.687
I'm more worried
about what he's already done.

03:06.687 --> 03:09.648
I'll get my bag.

03:09.648 --> 03:10.566
♪ I'm coming with the rats
and the roaches ♪

03:13.569 --> 03:16.071
♪ Never turn my back... ♪

03:16.071 --> 03:17.239
I don't need a pep talk

03:17.239 --> 03:19.700
or ice cream or twin cuddles.

03:19.700 --> 03:22.411
Well, you controlled
yourself better

03:22.411 --> 03:23.662
than on your school tour
with Lizzie.

03:23.662 --> 03:26.999
So points for that.

03:26.999 --> 03:28.667
Maybe I'm a little upset about
how things ended with Landon.

03:28.667 --> 03:31.295
But it's no one's
problem but mine.

03:34.047 --> 03:34.798
Great.
Seems totally under control.

03:38.218 --> 03:41.471
In which case,

03:41.471 --> 03:42.973
maybe you can help me
with something?

03:42.973 --> 03:44.975
Does it involve punching things?

03:44.975 --> 03:47.394
Possibly. Lizzie went

03:47.394 --> 03:49.062
on this witch-y wellness retreat
that Dad thought

03:49.062 --> 03:51.190
would be a good idea,

03:51.190 --> 03:52.191
but I haven't heard
from her

03:52.191 --> 03:54.443
in over a week.

03:54.443 --> 03:55.194
I think that she might be
in trouble.

04:08.165 --> 04:10.709
Oh...
Nice shot, nice shot.

04:18.884 --> 04:20.511
Whoo! All right, that's game.

04:20.511 --> 04:24.056
Hit the showers.

04:24.056 --> 04:25.682
I don't know
what's more shocking--

04:25.682 --> 04:27.476
that you hit that shot
or that you guys shower.

04:27.476 --> 04:28.936
Well, you're definitely
new around here.

04:28.936 --> 04:31.063
'Cause everyone knows
I ball hard.

04:31.063 --> 04:31.855
Yeah, I'm not touching that one.

04:33.649 --> 04:33.982
Uh, you dropped
something.

04:38.111 --> 04:39.363
Newest member of the pack

04:39.363 --> 04:40.864
always cleans up.

04:40.864 --> 04:42.157
Everyone knows that.

04:42.157 --> 04:43.909
Apparently not.

04:43.909 --> 04:45.160
Hey, it's nothing
personal, okay?

04:45.160 --> 04:47.204
Brutus did it for,
like, a year.

04:47.204 --> 04:48.664
That's just the way
we do things in a pack.
Maybe that should change.

04:48.664 --> 04:50.791
Werewolf lesson
number two--

04:50.791 --> 04:51.834
never question
the alpha's rules.

04:51.834 --> 04:53.961
Ever.

04:53.961 --> 04:55.629
If the alpha
makes the rules,

04:55.629 --> 04:56.421
how do you become the alpha?
Well, that's easy.

04:56.421 --> 04:59.049
And hard.

04:59.049 --> 04:59.842
You want to be the man,
you gotta beat the man.

04:59.842 --> 05:02.678
Come on.

05:02.678 --> 05:04.930
No.

05:04.930 --> 05:06.098
You gotta beat the woman.

05:08.058 --> 05:09.309
Alpha challenge.

05:11.061 --> 05:13.689
Alpha challenge! Whoo!

05:16.316 --> 05:17.776
<i>So much for the element
of surprise.</i>

05:17.776 --> 05:20.821
We're too exposed out here.

05:20.821 --> 05:22.155
We should head into the woods,
see if we can find the camp,

05:22.155 --> 05:24.908
and try to lay eyes
on Lizzie.

05:24.908 --> 05:26.159
Or... we could just
introduce ourselves.

05:26.159 --> 05:30.080
And what if we walk into a trap?

05:30.080 --> 05:32.207
You're acting really weird

05:32.207 --> 05:33.333
for someone
who's supposed to be worried

05:33.333 --> 05:34.501
about her missing sister.

05:34.501 --> 05:36.879
Lizzie!

05:36.879 --> 05:37.880
Namaste.

05:40.632 --> 05:41.383
I'm so glad
you guys are here.

05:43.051 --> 05:44.887
You made really good time.

05:44.887 --> 05:46.972
You knew we were coming?

05:46.972 --> 05:48.932
Jo and I
have been talking

05:48.932 --> 05:50.142
about it since I got here.

05:50.142 --> 05:52.519
But I still
can't believe

05:52.519 --> 05:53.103
that you were so open to it.

05:53.103 --> 05:54.688
Mm.

05:54.688 --> 05:55.981
Me, neither.

05:57.399 --> 05:59.109
Come.

05:59.109 --> 06:00.110
I'll show you around.

06:00.110 --> 06:01.820
Peace of mind awaits.

06:01.820 --> 06:04.364
Like I said...

06:04.364 --> 06:05.824
trap.

06:27.304 --> 06:31.892
This looks... great.

06:31.892 --> 06:34.144
It looks like Witchapalooza.

06:34.144 --> 06:36.104
Which is great,

06:36.104 --> 06:37.856
because you could
use some healing.

06:37.856 --> 06:39.816
Jo told me

06:39.816 --> 06:40.526
all about Andon-Lay.

06:40.526 --> 06:43.320
Did she?

06:43.320 --> 06:44.154
Every gory detail.
Him dumping you

06:44.154 --> 06:46.031
like that?

06:46.031 --> 06:47.658
Total dick move.

06:53.539 --> 06:54.540
We don't worry about dicks here.

06:54.540 --> 06:58.085
No boys allowed.

06:58.085 --> 07:00.462
So you'll forget about
birdbrain in no time.

07:00.462 --> 07:02.631
I bet. Everyone here
looks like they're on drugs.

07:02.631 --> 07:05.259
It's not like that, Hope.

07:05.259 --> 07:07.386
This is a
wellness retreat,

07:07.386 --> 07:08.971
for witches, by witches.

07:08.971 --> 07:11.932
Well...

07:13.600 --> 07:15.727
Andi.

07:15.727 --> 07:17.354
She's so amazing.

07:17.354 --> 07:19.273
She's been a real mentor to me.

07:19.273 --> 07:20.941
How exactly

07:20.941 --> 07:22.401
did she help you?

07:22.401 --> 07:24.236
Andi reframed
my former,

07:24.236 --> 07:24.862
limiting mindset
to reflect my emotional goals.

07:26.655 --> 07:28.615
Okay, I'll say it.
This feels a little cult-y.

07:31.159 --> 07:34.663
We're just
a collection

07:34.663 --> 07:36.290
of like-minded individuals,
all following the teachings

07:36.290 --> 07:38.041
of a brilliant and
charismatic leader.

07:38.041 --> 07:41.712
Mm-hmm.

07:41.712 --> 07:42.129
Right, make that
a lot cult-y.

07:44.006 --> 07:44.298
What's with all the crystals?

07:49.303 --> 07:50.596
Each color represents a step
on the pathway to enlightenment.

07:50.596 --> 07:54.850
So the blue one
you're wearing...

07:54.850 --> 07:58.353
It's the top step.

07:58.353 --> 07:59.563
Which means that I get to
take part in next week's

07:59.563 --> 08:02.941
sacred purification ritual.

08:02.941 --> 08:04.193
What lands you
on sacred dirt duty?

08:04.193 --> 08:07.154
Oh.

08:07.154 --> 08:08.655
Don't mind Samantha.

08:08.655 --> 08:10.824
She was Andi's star pupil,

08:10.824 --> 08:13.285
until I got here.

08:13.285 --> 08:14.828
And then
her petty jealousy and anger

08:14.828 --> 08:17.915
knocked her
down a peg--

08:17.915 --> 08:19.208
well, several--

08:19.208 --> 08:21.376
into the red.

08:21.376 --> 08:23.253
That's why it's
so important

08:23.253 --> 08:24.671
to stay focused
on your own path.

08:28.467 --> 08:30.886
Afternoon enrichment.

08:30.886 --> 08:32.888
All colors on the crystal path
are welcome.

08:36.225 --> 08:38.143
Come on.
You guys have to meet Andi.

08:41.939 --> 08:45.484
I told you
I didn't want any help.

08:45.484 --> 08:48.737
In my defense,

08:48.737 --> 08:49.821
I didn't know that this was
what help looked like.

08:49.821 --> 08:51.782
We don't have to stay.

08:51.782 --> 08:53.867
We do.

08:53.867 --> 08:55.494
Because something weird's
going on here.

08:55.494 --> 08:56.453
And we're not leaving
unless Lizzie comes with us.

08:56.453 --> 08:58.664
Hopefully willingly.

08:58.664 --> 08:59.039
<i>I don't fight with girls.</i>

09:01.708 --> 09:02.918
Except when you're knocking
them down in a pickup game

09:02.918 --> 09:05.295
or sparring with them.

09:05.295 --> 09:06.880
No, like, a real fight--

09:06.880 --> 09:08.298
to the death,
if that's what it takes.

09:08.298 --> 09:10.175
And I don't plan on
starting now.

09:10.175 --> 09:11.468
Hey, glad we can both agree
on not dying.

09:11.468 --> 09:13.262
So, what if I
challenge you

09:13.262 --> 09:14.638
to something else?

09:14.638 --> 09:16.473
That's not in the rules.

09:16.473 --> 09:17.516
But what is
in the rules

09:17.516 --> 09:19.017
is that the alpha

09:19.017 --> 09:20.185
can't turn down any challenge,

09:20.185 --> 09:21.311
no matter what
it entails.

09:22.479 --> 09:23.313
Okay.

09:26.984 --> 09:28.443
What do you have in mind?

09:28.443 --> 09:30.112
I saw an old pool table
in storage

09:30.112 --> 09:30.904
when I was picking out
some stuff for my room.

09:30.904 --> 09:33.282
Deal.

09:33.282 --> 09:33.448
Good luck.
You're gonna need it.

09:38.453 --> 09:38.912
<i>I want to welcome
all our new faces.</i>

09:41.331 --> 09:42.374
I know you're here
because you're struggling.

09:42.374 --> 09:46.587
Believe me...

09:46.587 --> 09:48.922
I have, too.

09:48.922 --> 09:50.340
I've lived in darkness
for so many years,

09:50.340 --> 09:52.676
which is why I have
dedicated myself

09:52.676 --> 09:54.803
to helping other witches

09:54.803 --> 09:56.555
reach the light.

09:56.555 --> 09:58.765
Lizzie,

09:58.765 --> 09:59.850
would you help me
demonstrate how we do that?

09:59.850 --> 10:02.394
It would be my honor.

10:02.394 --> 10:03.061
Think of this crystal,
and the ones linked to it

10:05.439 --> 10:07.858
that we all
wear, like...

10:07.858 --> 10:10.360
a mood ring.

10:10.360 --> 10:11.778
We ask all
new arrivals

10:11.778 --> 10:15.282
to lay their
hands on it,

10:15.282 --> 10:15.782
to discover where they'll
be beginning their journey.

10:18.368 --> 10:19.536
My ancestors' coven

10:23.332 --> 10:25.000
believed that we were ruled
by our emotions,

10:25.000 --> 10:27.169
and that if we could
learn to take control

10:27.169 --> 10:29.880
of our emotional state,

10:29.880 --> 10:31.215
that we could take back control
of our lives.

10:31.215 --> 10:33.717
Live them to the fullest.

10:37.054 --> 10:37.596
That's wonderful,
Lizzie.

10:39.890 --> 10:41.934
Though I expected nothing less
from you.

10:41.934 --> 10:42.518
The beautiful blue color
that Lizzie has just shown us

10:45.103 --> 10:47.940
represents complete
purity of thought.

10:47.940 --> 10:51.443
The elimination

10:51.443 --> 10:53.529
of all negative feelings

10:53.529 --> 10:55.364
preventing us
from living free,

10:55.364 --> 10:57.699
happy and
fulfilled lives.

10:57.699 --> 11:00.702
This is the ideal

11:00.702 --> 11:02.996
you should all
strive to attain.

11:02.996 --> 11:05.958
This is...

11:05.958 --> 11:07.918
enlightenment.

11:10.295 --> 11:14.883
Now, could I have

11:14.883 --> 11:16.927
a less accomplished volunteer?

11:16.927 --> 11:19.429
Someone who needs help

11:19.429 --> 11:20.639
controlling negative emotions.

11:22.558 --> 11:25.185
It's Hope, right?

11:25.185 --> 11:27.521
Oh, I didn't raise my hand.

11:27.521 --> 11:29.648
So you don't harbor

11:29.648 --> 11:31.900
any negative emotions?

11:31.900 --> 11:33.110
I just don't need
your help controlling them.

11:33.110 --> 11:35.445
When we aren't
in control,

11:35.445 --> 11:37.739
it's difficult to trust
those who are.

11:37.739 --> 11:40.325
Oh, no, I don't trust you
because you're a fraud.

11:41.785 --> 11:44.037
Then, please.

11:44.037 --> 11:45.581
Come up and prove it.

11:45.581 --> 11:48.166
I'm so sorry.

11:48.166 --> 11:49.668
Bringing you here
was a bad idea

11:49.668 --> 11:50.794
and so is you
going up there.
Okay.

11:50.794 --> 11:52.671
I'll touch your rock.

11:52.671 --> 11:53.547
But I think it's crystal clear
what kind of mood I'm in.

11:57.301 --> 11:58.093
You have extraordinary power.

12:01.972 --> 12:02.222
I'm not sure I'm capable,
but let me try to help.

12:04.057 --> 12:05.851
I didn't say you could touch me.

12:11.481 --> 12:15.652
But I'm so glad you did.

12:15.652 --> 12:19.072
Suddenly,

12:19.072 --> 12:21.575
I feel better.

12:21.575 --> 12:22.576
This is a power my coven has
spent generations mastering.

12:22.576 --> 12:26.538
Empathic transference.

12:26.538 --> 12:28.916
It's why I must
always wear gloves.

12:28.916 --> 12:31.126
Skin-to-skin contact
with an empath

12:31.126 --> 12:33.962
can feel overwhelming
for the uninitiated.

12:33.962 --> 12:38.008
I was so angry
at my ex-boyfriend, but...

12:38.008 --> 12:41.428
I don't know,
I-I just feel like I'm, um...

12:41.428 --> 12:43.514
Enlightened.

12:45.891 --> 12:48.185
You're free now.

12:50.812 --> 12:52.439
There's no point in hiding
your emotional truth

12:52.439 --> 12:54.358
when everyone can see it
for themselves.

13:00.906 --> 13:01.532
I've been waiting for
someone like you, Hope.

13:05.869 --> 13:06.662
You and I are gonna
do great things together.

13:21.218 --> 13:24.221
Hi, Andi.

13:24.221 --> 13:25.055
Sorry to bother you during
personal meditation time.

13:25.055 --> 13:27.432
Can I come in?

13:27.432 --> 13:29.476
Oh, I could use the, uh,

13:29.476 --> 13:31.478
the fresh air.

13:31.478 --> 13:33.105
Where's your crystal?

13:35.065 --> 13:36.859
Actually, that's why I'm here.

13:36.859 --> 13:38.777
I had a bit of a setback.

13:40.696 --> 13:41.905
Oh. How-how big is a bit?

13:47.035 --> 13:52.207
Oh. Huge, then.

13:52.207 --> 13:54.751
I got a little jealous when
I saw you working with Hope.

13:54.751 --> 13:56.753
Uh, saying all those things
about how great she is...

13:56.753 --> 14:00.716
i-it's triggering for me,

14:00.716 --> 14:01.842
because I've heard those things,
like, a million times before.

14:01.842 --> 14:04.887
But I know that that is silly

14:04.887 --> 14:07.723
because you chose me to help you

14:07.723 --> 14:09.850
lead the purification ritual
next week.

14:09.850 --> 14:12.644
So, uh,

14:12.644 --> 14:14.188
if you could just
juice me back up.

14:14.188 --> 14:15.856
Oh. I'm afraid I need
to conserve my energy.

14:15.856 --> 14:20.068
Given recent events,
I've moved the ceremony up.

14:20.068 --> 14:22.112
And by, uh, recent events,
you mean...

14:24.198 --> 14:28.202
Hope is very, very special,
like you said.

14:28.202 --> 14:30.829
She's so powerful,
we don't need to recruit

14:30.829 --> 14:33.332
any more witches, so...

14:33.332 --> 14:35.042
the ritual will happen

14:35.042 --> 14:37.169
later this evening.

14:37.169 --> 14:39.254
Oh, wh-what am I supposed to do?

14:39.254 --> 14:41.006
You know the path
that those in the red must take.

14:41.006 --> 14:43.550
I wish you well on it.

14:53.352 --> 14:54.978
Son of a bitch.

14:54.978 --> 14:57.773
That hiker was found
in these woods,

14:57.773 --> 14:59.775
mauled to death
and drained of blood.

14:59.775 --> 15:01.818
And now a member
of the search party

15:01.818 --> 15:03.153
who was out looking for him
is missing, too.

15:03.153 --> 15:04.530
This is a Malivore monster,
Dorian.

15:04.530 --> 15:07.032
Since they showed up,

15:07.032 --> 15:08.158
nearly all the blood
in Mystic Falls

15:08.158 --> 15:09.034
has been on their hands.

15:09.034 --> 15:10.994
Claws. Whatever.

15:10.994 --> 15:12.454
That's the thing.
We're not in Mystic Falls.

15:12.454 --> 15:14.665
We're in Grove Hill.
And so is MG.

15:14.665 --> 15:16.667
Look, MG is a good kid,
and you know it.

15:16.667 --> 15:19.711
I do. I do.

15:19.711 --> 15:21.338
But good doesn't factor
into the equation

15:21.338 --> 15:23.048
when we're talking
about Rippers.
I get it.

15:23.048 --> 15:24.550
You don't want
what happened to your family

15:24.550 --> 15:26.134
to happen to anyone else.

15:26.134 --> 15:27.010
We don't know anything yet.

15:27.010 --> 15:29.221
Okay?

15:29.221 --> 15:30.806
So let's just find MG.

15:30.806 --> 15:31.890
Dr. Saltzman...

15:31.890 --> 15:34.351
MG.

15:34.351 --> 15:34.643
I need your help.
There's a body...

15:36.645 --> 15:37.938
Dorian, no!

15:42.484 --> 15:43.652
Found him.

15:53.453 --> 15:55.706
You're doing it wrong.

15:59.042 --> 16:02.546
I'm sorry I'm not an expert
-at scrubbing skivvies like you.
-You will be.

16:02.546 --> 16:03.589
'Cause I'll be back to blue
before you,

16:03.589 --> 16:04.715
with that attitude.

16:04.715 --> 16:05.549
Face facts.

16:07.843 --> 16:09.511
We're both cherry red, Samantha,

16:09.511 --> 16:11.346
which sucks hard enough,

16:11.346 --> 16:11.972
so let's just call a truce.

16:11.972 --> 16:14.683
Fine.

16:17.895 --> 16:22.733
Oh, my God.
Andi's glove.

16:22.733 --> 16:24.526
This isn't supposed to be
in the wash.

16:24.526 --> 16:26.069
Give it to me.
I'll go take it back to her.

16:26.069 --> 16:28.739
No. I don't think so.

16:28.739 --> 16:29.948
Andi's gonna be so happy
when I return this,

16:31.742 --> 16:34.077
she'll help me back to...

16:34.077 --> 16:36.163
What the hell?

16:36.163 --> 16:37.581
How is that even possible?

16:37.581 --> 16:39.208
Let me see it.
There's so many things

16:39.208 --> 16:41.126
I wanted to say to you,

16:41.126 --> 16:42.920
just a minute ago, but...

16:42.920 --> 16:44.505
now I feel above them all.

16:44.505 --> 16:46.673
Good luck on your journey.

16:47.883 --> 16:49.927
Go blue yourself.

16:49.927 --> 16:50.385
<i>I could use some help in here.</i>

16:55.474 --> 16:56.767
No, no. Not that kind.

16:58.852 --> 17:00.896
I'm not tying him up.
I'm taking him home.

17:00.896 --> 17:02.397
Good. We can put him in
the werewolf bunker, then.

17:02.397 --> 17:04.691
We don't even know
what happened yet,

17:04.691 --> 17:06.235
because you tranqued him
before we could ask.
Actually, we do.

17:06.235 --> 17:08.529
I just found the body
of that missing

17:08.529 --> 17:09.530
search party member
in the woods.

17:09.530 --> 17:11.198
Just like MG said.

17:11.198 --> 17:12.866
You still think
I should've waited

17:12.866 --> 17:14.243
for him to rip your
throat out, too?

17:14.243 --> 17:16.537
You used to hunt
vampires, Ric.

17:16.537 --> 17:18.038
I thought you knew how
dangerous Rippers can be.

17:18.038 --> 17:20.082
I guess you've changed.

17:20.082 --> 17:22.376
I'm trying to.

17:22.376 --> 17:24.169
Assuming the worst of people

17:24.169 --> 17:26.296
has only ever brought out
the worst in me.

17:26.296 --> 17:26.755
And I am not gonna condemn MG
until I hear his side of it.

17:28.257 --> 17:31.134
In the meantime,
I got a body to bury.

17:36.431 --> 17:40.644
Hopefully there won't be another
when I get back.

17:40.644 --> 17:41.645
<i>Oh, this is gonna be
a bloodbath.</i>

17:44.022 --> 17:44.815
Like, bloodier than
an actual fight to the death.

19:43.308 --> 19:45.435
And you deserve it.

20:15.424 --> 20:15.924
I hate that it's
actually cute in here.

20:28.145 --> 20:32.816
"Warning.
Avoid dermal contact.

20:32.816 --> 20:35.027
Produces psychotropic effects."

20:36.320 --> 20:38.113
Triad.

20:40.699 --> 20:42.201
That's never good.

20:42.201 --> 20:43.952
Who's there?

21:03.430 --> 21:08.018
Maybe Ric was right.

21:08.018 --> 21:09.770
Not about everything, but...

21:09.770 --> 21:12.689
I do feel connected to you.

21:13.315 --> 21:15.025
Colin Lafferty.

21:18.487 --> 21:19.029
I've lost people I loved
the way your family lost you.

21:22.157 --> 21:25.577
I'm sorry they won't get
the closure they deserve,

21:25.577 --> 21:29.831
but maybe...

21:29.831 --> 21:31.250
maybe "missing" is better
than knowing the truth.

21:36.713 --> 21:41.552
But I'll check in
on your family.

21:41.552 --> 21:44.388
And on the vampire
that killed you...

21:44.388 --> 21:45.514
...so that this never
happens again.

22:12.541 --> 22:14.501
Oh, damn.

22:29.975 --> 22:32.477
Psst. Psst.

22:32.477 --> 22:34.646
Hey.
Lizzie.

22:36.231 --> 22:37.524
Where have you been?

22:37.524 --> 22:39.067
It's a long story.

22:39.067 --> 22:40.194
Hope was right, again.

22:40.194 --> 22:41.570
It's definitely a cult.

22:41.570 --> 22:43.989
Now let's get the hell out.

22:43.989 --> 22:45.324
Mm. I've been feeling so much
better since we got here.

22:45.324 --> 22:47.242
So was I, okay?
But did you miss

22:47.242 --> 22:48.869
the part where I admitted
you were right?

22:48.869 --> 22:50.662
Andi doesn't have
special powers.

22:50.662 --> 22:53.582
She's a basic witch, a fraud.

22:53.582 --> 22:54.833
Her crystal is blue all the time
because it's colored glass.

22:54.833 --> 22:58.837
And that enlightenment
you feel

22:58.837 --> 23:00.589
is some magic drug from Triad.

23:00.589 --> 23:03.425
Eh, that's never good.
Right?

23:03.425 --> 23:05.511
I don't know what
her connection is to them,

23:05.511 --> 23:07.554
and frankly, I don't care.

23:07.554 --> 23:08.680
Okay? We can figure that out
once we're gone.

23:08.680 --> 23:10.933
If you trust me.

23:12.809 --> 23:14.102
Of course we do. Let's go.

23:16.647 --> 23:17.272
Oh, great. Now what's she up to?

23:22.444 --> 23:25.906
Put your back into it, Samantha.

23:31.286 --> 23:34.540
Hope? Jo? Are you okay?

23:34.540 --> 23:36.792
We've never been better.

23:36.792 --> 23:39.419
Oh, okay. In that case,

23:39.419 --> 23:42.005
I'm gonna drive
back to school

23:42.005 --> 23:43.257
and get some help and earplugs.

23:43.257 --> 23:45.717
<i>Ad somnum.</i>

23:45.717 --> 23:46.885
No. Stay with us.

23:56.895 --> 24:00.774
You lying, traitorous phony.

24:02.734 --> 24:04.653
I could say the same to you.

24:07.614 --> 24:08.949
Sneaking in here
and breaking my things.

24:08.949 --> 24:11.034
At least you can't
mind-control me.

24:11.034 --> 24:12.911
Not currently.

24:12.911 --> 24:14.538
I must admit,

24:14.538 --> 24:16.290
I've been wondering
why that is.

24:16.290 --> 24:18.166
Because one drop of this
on my gloves

24:18.166 --> 24:20.085
is normally enough

24:20.085 --> 24:21.545
to make every witch here
worship me.

24:21.545 --> 24:22.045
Well, the gloves
are off now, bitch.

24:24.506 --> 24:25.174
Maybe...

24:29.136 --> 24:31.096
it's your brain
chemistry

24:31.096 --> 24:32.139
or just your overwhelmingly
bad vibes.

24:32.139 --> 24:33.557
You should have seen

24:36.560 --> 24:37.519
what Triad did to witches
that stuff didn't work on.

24:37.519 --> 24:41.648
Very un-feminist.

24:41.648 --> 24:42.608
Well, it wasn't bad enough to
make you stop working for them.

24:42.608 --> 24:44.860
No supernatural

24:46.445 --> 24:47.821
ever worked for Triad.

24:47.821 --> 24:50.324
We were imprisoned,

24:50.324 --> 24:51.283
locked in cells and forced
to do their bidding.

24:55.078 --> 24:56.580
Locator spells,

24:56.580 --> 24:57.956
concealment spells,
even torture,

24:57.956 --> 25:00.209
all the while being drugged

25:00.209 --> 25:03.086
to stay compliant.

25:03.086 --> 25:04.630
Well, maybe your sob story
would land a little better

25:04.630 --> 25:08.050
if you weren't doing
the same thing

25:08.050 --> 25:10.219
to every witch here.

25:10.219 --> 25:11.803
Said the self-indulgent
daddy's girl who's never had

25:11.803 --> 25:14.515
a real problem
in her life.

25:14.515 --> 25:16.808
I've overcome a lot.

25:16.808 --> 25:18.185
You're clearly not an empath,
so what's the ritual really for?

25:18.185 --> 25:21.563
Sorry, that information is

25:21.563 --> 25:23.774
for blue crystal witches only.

25:23.774 --> 25:26.568
Speaking of...

25:26.568 --> 25:27.778
You wanted to see me, Andi?

25:30.489 --> 25:32.407
Your sister wants to join

25:32.407 --> 25:34.535
tonight's event.

25:34.535 --> 25:36.286
It's technically
against the rules,

25:36.286 --> 25:36.787
but why don't you bring her down
for the grand finale.

25:40.916 --> 25:45.796
After all,

25:45.796 --> 25:47.297
the ritual requires
a human sacrifice.

25:47.297 --> 25:49.883
<i>You're getting murdered.</i>

25:49.883 --> 25:52.928
Yeah. I noticed.

25:52.928 --> 25:54.930
I mean, have you
even taken a shot?
Just one.

25:56.348 --> 25:58.392
I missed.

25:58.392 --> 26:00.811
Oh!

26:00.811 --> 26:01.979
Et tu Brutus?

26:03.814 --> 26:04.898
Hey, I'm still your alpha.

26:04.898 --> 26:06.567
Not for long, bruh.

26:11.238 --> 26:11.613
Eight ball, corner pocket.

26:16.243 --> 26:17.536
Sink it, and I'm
the leader of the pack, right?

26:23.166 --> 26:24.710
Those are the rules.

26:39.141 --> 26:39.892
<i>I think I know
a way out of this mess.</i>

26:43.770 --> 26:46.481
Maybe Andi was right
for once,

26:46.481 --> 26:48.400
and my negative emotions
are what kept her

26:48.400 --> 26:50.235
from being able
to mind-control me.

26:50.235 --> 26:51.153
So if I can do
the same thing to you...

26:51.153 --> 26:52.654
...worth a shot.

26:55.365 --> 26:56.241
Although you probably like
being mind-controlled--

26:58.452 --> 27:00.078
because that was basically
our dynamic for years.

27:00.078 --> 27:02.789
I don't know what you mean.

27:02.789 --> 27:05.042
That's right,

27:05.042 --> 27:06.627
you're independent
all of a sudden,

27:06.627 --> 27:08.545
going to Mystic Falls High
all by yourself...

27:08.545 --> 27:10.923
Oh, wait,
you're already back

27:10.923 --> 27:13.467
at the Salvatore School.

27:13.467 --> 27:14.593
I guess that phase lasted
about as long

27:14.593 --> 27:16.011
as your Dark Josie bender.

27:18.639 --> 27:18.972
And now you're here,

27:23.769 --> 27:24.978
worried about me and Hope,
and completely neglecting

27:24.978 --> 27:26.980
your own happiness with Finch

27:26.980 --> 27:29.274
in the process.

27:29.274 --> 27:30.567
I mean,
at least I'm trying

27:30.567 --> 27:32.027
to be happy...
Are you seriously

27:32.027 --> 27:33.487
pinning this on
me right now?!

27:33.487 --> 27:34.738
You're the one
that indoctrinated us

27:34.738 --> 27:35.697
into a freaking cult, and I'm...

27:35.697 --> 27:37.241
Back to normal.

27:40.410 --> 27:41.495
You are brilliant
and I love you.

27:41.495 --> 27:44.706
I know. Where's Hope?

27:44.706 --> 27:47.125
She's at the ritual.

27:47.125 --> 27:48.585
But there's no way
that you can get

27:48.585 --> 27:49.419
close enough to Andi
to pull that stunt.

27:49.419 --> 27:50.671
Sure I can.

27:53.882 --> 27:58.095
You just need
to tie me up again.

28:01.849 --> 28:03.600
ALARIC
Dorian.

28:03.600 --> 28:05.102
I'm here.

28:05.102 --> 28:06.728
Dorian.

28:06.728 --> 28:09.106
I heard that growl,

28:09.106 --> 28:10.440
followed a trail
of blood...

28:10.440 --> 28:12.651
Yours, obviously.

28:12.651 --> 28:14.528
Oh, man, is that a tooth?
I wonder who has

28:14.528 --> 28:17.030
whatever this belongs to
in the monster pool.

28:17.030 --> 28:19.616
You're not gonna
believe it, Ric.

28:19.616 --> 28:21.118
Wendigo.

28:21.118 --> 28:23.203
Come on.

28:23.203 --> 28:24.621
It's never a wendigo.

28:24.621 --> 28:26.331
Until today.
I got a few licks in

28:26.331 --> 28:28.375
with the shovel
before I ran, but...

28:28.375 --> 28:30.836
that thing hits a lot harder.

28:30.836 --> 28:31.545
I'd be dead
if I hadn't found this place.

28:33.797 --> 28:38.135
A cave...

28:38.135 --> 28:40.596
stocked with a cooler
full of blood bags?

28:40.596 --> 28:44.892
This is where
MG's been hiding out.

28:44.892 --> 28:46.768
I was wrong about him.

28:48.645 --> 28:53.317
I read his journal.

28:55.694 --> 28:59.823
He's been helping people.

28:59.823 --> 29:05.495
He needs to work on
his superhero name, but...

29:05.495 --> 29:07.331
MG must've got the blood on him
from trying to stop the wendigo.

29:07.331 --> 29:10.417
Come on,
let's get you out of here

29:10.417 --> 29:12.085
before it comes back
for seconds.

29:12.085 --> 29:12.669
Yeah.

29:17.049 --> 29:21.970
Too late.

29:21.970 --> 29:25.516
<i>I don't think I can do this.</i>

29:25.516 --> 29:28.352
I thought you loved
drama class.

29:28.352 --> 29:30.062
Just act like a brainwashed
idiot and get me on that stage.

29:33.315 --> 29:35.943
Hope's feeling good now,
but I have a decade

29:35.943 --> 29:38.695
of petty resentments
to spew

29:38.695 --> 29:40.405
that'll change all of that
in a heartbeat.

29:58.423 --> 30:00.509
Hope Andrea Mikaelson.

30:05.389 --> 30:08.934
Jo, was there something
you wanted to say?

30:14.857 --> 30:17.484
Well, aren't you
gonna say anything?

30:17.484 --> 30:19.736
Yes. I am.

30:19.736 --> 30:21.154
Hmm.

30:22.114 --> 30:26.493
That crystal doesn't work
on you,

30:26.535 --> 30:28.579
and blue isn't your color.

30:28.579 --> 30:30.038
I appreciate the feedback.

30:30.038 --> 30:31.790
I don't.

30:31.790 --> 30:33.125
Hope, throw them both
in the hole

30:33.125 --> 30:34.084
so we can get
this party started.

30:34.084 --> 30:35.419
Wait.

30:38.755 --> 30:40.507
I hate that I have to do this--

30:40.507 --> 30:41.884
because all I've
ever wanted for you

30:41.884 --> 30:43.260
is happiness-- but...

30:43.260 --> 30:45.012
this isn't happiness.

30:45.012 --> 30:46.138
And not just because Andi's
a fraud,

30:46.138 --> 30:48.891
even though she is,

30:48.891 --> 30:50.976
but because you're
lying to yourself.

30:50.976 --> 30:51.643
You're mad at Landon, and you're
blaming him for the breakup.

30:53.145 --> 30:55.314
But it's not all
Landon's fault.

30:57.774 --> 30:59.651
And deep down, you know that.

30:59.651 --> 31:00.444
Stop saying his name.
You've known

31:02.571 --> 31:05.157
that you and Landon have been

31:05.157 --> 31:06.700
biologically incompatible
since he literally dissolved

31:06.700 --> 31:08.827
after having sex with you.

31:08.827 --> 31:09.995
But you chose to
deny that fact,

31:12.206 --> 31:14.208
and now you know

31:14.208 --> 31:15.918
that neither you or Landon

31:15.918 --> 31:18.545
can ever truly be
happy together.

31:18.545 --> 31:20.214
What I know is that
I moved heaven and earth

31:20.214 --> 31:23.091
to bring him back to me,

31:23.091 --> 31:24.468
and he didn't even tell me
when he was still alive.

31:24.468 --> 31:26.053
And then he left me
all over again.

31:26.053 --> 31:28.555
Landon finally did

31:28.555 --> 31:29.598
the one thing that
you weren't strong enough to do.

31:32.601 --> 31:37.272
Hope... is that you?

31:37.272 --> 31:39.107
That's the last of them, Hope.

31:39.107 --> 31:40.108
Hurry up.

31:48.992 --> 31:53.789
Sorry to keep you waiting.

31:53.789 --> 31:54.915
This is the part
where you attack me

31:57.334 --> 31:58.377
and deeply regret it later.

32:00.546 --> 32:02.840
How do we kill this damn thing?

32:02.840 --> 32:03.924
How the hell
am I supposed to know?

32:03.924 --> 32:04.591
It's never a wendigo.

32:09.137 --> 32:09.972
I doubt that's gonna do it.

32:18.689 --> 32:20.023
Never doubted you, rock.

32:22.442 --> 32:23.235
Thanks for distracting him
for me.

32:27.030 --> 32:28.365
Wendigos have hearts of ice.

32:30.826 --> 32:33.245
It's their weakness,

32:33.245 --> 32:35.122
like sunlight for a vampire.

32:35.122 --> 32:37.416
Unless you use that weakness

32:37.416 --> 32:39.877
and make it your strength.

32:40.961 --> 32:41.753
I had wendigo
in the monster pool.

32:49.178 --> 32:50.470
<i>Lizzie, wake up.
You're gonna be okay.</i>

32:52.014 --> 32:54.016
Cool.

32:55.851 --> 32:57.978
My plan worked.

32:57.978 --> 32:59.563
There's only one last thing
to take care of.

33:04.318 --> 33:05.110
Well?
Aren't you gonna say anything?

33:07.487 --> 33:10.365
Don't maim her yet.

33:10.365 --> 33:11.533
Not until she tells us what
this phony-ass retreat

33:11.533 --> 33:13.827
was for.

33:16.955 --> 33:19.499
I needed a lot of witches
with a lot of powerwho wouldn't ask any questions.

33:19.499 --> 33:21.418
I knew how
the drug worked firsthand,

33:21.418 --> 33:22.711
and I thought it would be easier
to catch flies

33:22.711 --> 33:26.048
with honey
than vinegar.

33:26.048 --> 33:27.549
What is the ritual for?

33:27.549 --> 33:29.760
All I know is it was
a summoning ritual--

33:29.760 --> 33:31.220
for what wasn't my concern.
I would've

33:31.220 --> 33:33.555
raised the devil himself
for my freedom.

33:33.555 --> 33:36.433
So you cut a deal.
With who?

33:36.433 --> 33:38.268
It wasn't that long ago,

33:38.268 --> 33:39.853
but it's just gone.

33:39.853 --> 33:42.147
I can't remember who it was.

33:42.147 --> 33:43.398
And I'm sure that
has nothing to do

33:43.398 --> 33:45.567
with the Malivore Pit.

33:45.567 --> 33:47.069
What I do remember
is that our deal

33:47.069 --> 33:48.237
was bound by
an unbreakable covenant spell,

33:48.237 --> 33:50.572
which means I will die

33:50.572 --> 33:51.698
if I fail
to complete the ritual.

33:51.698 --> 33:54.201
You're gonna fail.

33:59.623 --> 34:04.586
Then the peace I will know

34:04.586 --> 34:05.671
is that the three of you
will have to deal with

34:05.671 --> 34:07.589
whatever my death raises.

34:17.891 --> 34:22.229
I'm guessing she counts
as the human sacrifice

34:22.229 --> 34:24.690
the ritual needs?

34:24.690 --> 34:25.774
As much as I hate Andi,
that was a total boss move.

34:25.774 --> 34:29.695
What's gonna happen now?

34:29.695 --> 34:32.739
Well, when you combine Triad,

34:32.739 --> 34:34.157
hole in the ground
and forgotten memories...

34:36.535 --> 34:37.870
So much for peace of mind.

34:44.668 --> 34:49.673
So... should we tell
ghost stories by the fire

34:49.673 --> 34:53.302
while we wait for
whatever horrible thing's

34:53.302 --> 34:54.678
gonna come crawling
out of there?

34:54.678 --> 34:56.180
I know a scary one.

34:59.308 --> 35:00.976
"The Tale of the Crappy Friend
Who Told You

35:00.976 --> 35:03.854
You Deserved to Be Dumped."

35:03.854 --> 35:05.606
I'm sorry about that.

35:07.065 --> 35:09.902
It's okay.

35:09.902 --> 35:12.112
I needed to hear it.

35:12.112 --> 35:14.031
Just like you need to hear
that it's okay

35:14.031 --> 35:16.074
to let yourself be happy.

35:16.074 --> 35:17.034
Even if you're the only
one of us who is.

35:21.622 --> 35:21.914
Well, at least
coming here wasn't all bad?

35:23.332 --> 35:28.003
Mm.

35:28.003 --> 35:29.838
Well, I'm guessing
it will be

35:29.838 --> 35:30.756
once whatever Andi
drugged us with kicks in.

35:32.758 --> 35:34.426
Hey, guys. I think

35:34.426 --> 35:35.677
I figured out what Andi
was trying to do.

35:35.677 --> 35:36.220
She's turning us into pandas.

35:38.639 --> 35:41.558
Then she nailed it.

35:45.521 --> 35:49.608

35:49.608 --> 35:50.984

That's 150 proof
moonshine, my guy.

35:56.448 --> 35:59.076
Wolves gonna wolf.

35:59.076 --> 35:59.952

36:17.302 --> 36:19.263
You need a drink?

36:19.263 --> 36:20.848
Not my thing.

36:20.848 --> 36:21.473
Which I guess means
I have rules, too.

36:22.808 --> 36:24.434
Hey, about that...

36:27.437 --> 36:28.480
Maybe it's not fair to the pack

36:30.858 --> 36:32.067
to just say whoever's the best
at fighting or whatever

36:32.067 --> 36:34.611
is the best leader for them.

36:34.611 --> 36:37.865
Just like

36:37.865 --> 36:39.074
you scratching the eight ball
doesn't make me

36:39.074 --> 36:41.285
better than you at pool.

36:41.285 --> 36:41.869
Especially when you did it
on purpose.

36:44.204 --> 36:47.916
Why?

36:47.916 --> 36:49.793
You're right--
being good at those things

36:49.793 --> 36:52.546
isn't why you should
be the alpha.

36:52.546 --> 36:54.506
But seeing how much
it means to you,

36:54.506 --> 36:56.466
how much you care
about the pack...

36:56.466 --> 37:00.721
is another story.

37:00.721 --> 37:01.054
Oh, you know, back in the day,
I would've called you weak

37:04.975 --> 37:07.769
for throwing the game.

37:07.769 --> 37:08.478
Well, then if you can change,
maybe the rules can, too.

37:14.860 --> 37:18.197
Yeah.

37:38.342 --> 37:42.554
He's gonna be fine.

37:42.554 --> 37:44.723
Just a few
stitches and, uh,

37:44.723 --> 37:47.100
one whopper of a lie
to his doctor later.

37:49.353 --> 37:50.979
Oh, man.

37:50.979 --> 37:53.690
Emma's gonna
be so pissed at me.

37:53.690 --> 37:55.275
But not as pissed
as she would have been

37:57.486 --> 37:58.570
had you not saved our asses.

37:58.570 --> 38:00.781
Um...

38:00.781 --> 38:02.783
it was the least I could do.

38:02.783 --> 38:04.493
Considering how Mr. Williams
got hurt looking for me.

38:06.036 --> 38:08.372
Well, we shouldn't have
worried about you.

38:10.624 --> 38:13.001
Your journal
made that clear.

38:17.840 --> 38:21.718
I'm-I'm trying.

38:22.594 --> 38:23.262
But it's really hard

38:27.099 --> 38:29.726
doing this all on my own.

38:29.726 --> 38:30.978
Well, you could always
come back to school.

38:32.980 --> 38:36.400
I mean,

38:36.400 --> 38:38.193
especially now that the...

38:38.193 --> 38:39.444
wendigo trashed your Batcave.

38:44.366 --> 38:44.825
Before you, um,
you let me come back

38:48.704 --> 38:52.457
and it's all good,

38:52.457 --> 38:54.960
I think there's something
that you should know.

38:54.960 --> 38:56.670
I didn't compel Ethan
when you told me to.

38:59.256 --> 39:02.050
It-it was a mistake.

39:03.594 --> 39:05.971
But I learned from it.

39:05.971 --> 39:09.016
So, yeah, I want to come back.

39:09.016 --> 39:11.518
But I don't want to stop
helping people, either.

39:16.690 --> 39:20.986
Well...

39:20.986 --> 39:22.571
let's do both.

39:22.571 --> 39:24.698
Come on.

39:26.158 --> 39:28.076
Let's go home.

39:29.494 --> 39:30.662
<i>Okay, hear me out.</i>

39:30.662 --> 39:33.123
Andi drugged us.

39:33.123 --> 39:35.375
Just one drop of that liquid
that she had from Triad

39:35.375 --> 39:38.212
was enough to control
everyone's minds,

39:38.212 --> 39:40.631
and now I'm soaked in it.

39:40.631 --> 39:42.049
Maybe that's why I'm losing it.

39:44.259 --> 39:45.886
Lizzie, we're all pandas.

39:45.886 --> 39:48.347
We're in this together.

39:48.347 --> 39:48.805
We are in complete
pandagreement.
Okay, so

39:50.891 --> 39:53.560
we're all seeing
the same thing now?

39:53.560 --> 39:54.895

39:54.895 --> 39:56.813

39:57.898 --> 39:59.691
Unless that's bad.

39:59.691 --> 40:01.235
Guys, we have to
pull it together, okay?

40:01.235 --> 40:03.612
We need to be ready to fight.

40:03.612 --> 40:05.864
We are tripping balls, man!

40:05.864 --> 40:07.908
I mean, we have enough
problems already.

40:07.908 --> 40:11.995
Don't we always?

40:11.995 --> 40:13.038
When has that ever stopped us

40:13.038 --> 40:14.748
from fighting monsters?

40:14.748 --> 40:16.583
Yeah, you're right.
I came here

40:16.583 --> 40:19.002
because I thought
I was messed-up,

40:19.002 --> 40:20.921
but look at me.

40:20.921 --> 40:22.589
Look at my fur.

40:22.589 --> 40:24.508
I am a badass panda.

40:26.134 --> 40:27.469
Me, too.

40:29.346 --> 40:30.639
That's it.
We set up a trap.

40:30.639 --> 40:33.684
It's one of us

40:33.684 --> 40:35.269
on each side of the hole,
and-and we blast it

40:35.269 --> 40:36.353
with whatever spell
that we've got.

40:36.353 --> 40:38.021
We have to focus,

40:38.021 --> 40:39.815
'cause I'm sure that

40:39.815 --> 40:41.233
when whatever Andi summoned

40:41.233 --> 40:42.067
comes out of the thing,
it's gonna be...

40:44.278 --> 40:45.445
Pandemonium.

40:47.447 --> 40:49.116

40:49.116 --> 40:50.576

40:52.661 --> 40:53.579

41:01.545 --> 41:03.797
That was fun.

41:03.797 --> 41:05.132
Still high as a kite, but at
least we're not pandas anymore.

41:10.012 --> 41:13.724
Oh, unfortunately, that's where
our good news ends.
