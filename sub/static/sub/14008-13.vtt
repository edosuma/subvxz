00:02.132 --> 00:03.133
Previously on Damages:

00:03.134 --> 00:06.035
The warmth all lie
behind these walls.

00:09.143 --> 00:12.077
You okay there,
Patricia?

00:12.078 --> 00:15.309
- What's this?
- My resignation from the firm.

00:15.310 --> 00:17.309
I tracked the VIN on the
car that hit Ms. Hewes.

00:17.310 --> 00:19.677
- Who's the owner?
- Thomas Shayes.

00:19.678 --> 00:22.381
- And you two are...?
- Having a baby.

00:22.382 --> 00:25.950
Jill and I got the chromosomal
tests back. Kid's all mine.

00:25.951 --> 00:28.319
How much would it take
for you to walk away?

00:28.320 --> 00:30.888
- Make it $500,000.
- It's yours.

00:30.889 --> 00:32.791
Are you nuts?
We can't afford these.

00:32.792 --> 00:33.892
Oh, yes, we can.

00:33.893 --> 00:37.530
Frobisher may have hired a
police officer to commit a murder.

00:37.531 --> 00:39.467
What did Detective Messer tell
you?

00:39.468 --> 00:42.503
He thought there may have been a cover-up
surrounding my fiancÃ©'s murder.

00:42.504 --> 00:43.938
I pulled everything the
department had on Messer.

00:43.939 --> 00:46.874
It's a list of his partners.
I know this guy.

00:46.875 --> 00:49.209
Wes, it's Ellen.
I need to talk to you.

00:49.210 --> 00:51.211
Did you know Dad was
going to leave this behind?

00:51.212 --> 00:52.746
It explains where the money is.

00:52.747 --> 00:55.738
Your father never wanted anything
to happen to Tessa Marchetti.

00:55.739 --> 00:57.737
The girl was going
to turn us in.

00:57.738 --> 01:00.740
If you had told Joe that Tessa was
his daughter, she'd still be alive.

01:00.741 --> 01:02.141
This is my job, Dad.

01:02.142 --> 01:04.510
There's money, and I want in.

01:04.510 --> 01:06.745
We'll need to see some
identification, Mr. Zedeck.

01:06.746 --> 01:08.747
The usual denominations?

01:08.748 --> 01:14.053
So, the man who's acting as the
Tobins' lawyer is not Leonard Winstone.

01:14.054 --> 01:15.989
Who are you?

01:16.056 --> 01:19.226
I'm the man who has taken care of
your family for almost three decades.

01:19.227 --> 01:21.862
You're not even a
lawyer!

01:21.863 --> 01:23.130
You're finished.

01:23.131 --> 01:25.699
I'll give you names,
account numbers, enough

01:25.700 --> 01:28.769
details to put them in prison
for the rest of their lives.

01:28.770 --> 01:33.441
- In exchange for what?
- Immunity from prosecution.

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:44.752 --> 01:48.054
I know it's a crucial time
for you.

01:48.055 --> 01:50.323
Finishing law school, job
interviews.

01:50.324 --> 01:52.492
I assume you've got
a bar exam coming up.

01:52.493 --> 01:53.493
Yes, I do.

01:53.494 --> 01:58.197
But I think we can agree that being a mother
is more important than any of that, huh?

02:20.187 --> 02:23.621
Excuse me.

02:23.689 --> 02:26.989
You, uh, study over at the
university?

02:26.990 --> 02:30.992
Yes.
The law school.

02:31.059 --> 02:33.726
What are you doing
walking all the way out here?

02:33.727 --> 02:37.961
Just wanted some
air.

02:38.028 --> 02:42.095
Well, you picked a
beautiful spot for it.

02:42.163 --> 02:44.096
My name is Decker.

02:44.163 --> 02:46.063
I'm the handyman around here.

02:46.064 --> 02:48.497
Patricia.
Nice to meet you.

02:48.498 --> 02:53.200
A baby's a big responsibility.
Sure you're ready?

02:53.267 --> 02:57.999
I've always
wanted a child.

03:47.936 --> 03:50.470
We're all set.

03:53.842 --> 03:56.076
What the hell
happened to this place?

03:56.077 --> 03:57.544
I was kicked out of
my house.

03:57.545 --> 03:59.411
I've been living here.
I hope that's all right.

03:59.412 --> 04:00.545
What's all that?

04:00.546 --> 04:03.446
Ah, as you know, my
family finances are a mess.

04:03.447 --> 04:05.415
I've been trying to sort it all
out.

04:05.416 --> 04:07.150
Good luck with
that.

04:07.151 --> 04:08.184
Mr. Winstone?

04:08.185 --> 04:13.489
I want you to know the DA's office
has agreed to your terms for immunity.

04:15.193 --> 04:17.861
I'd like to take
these and look them over.

04:17.862 --> 04:20.562
Due diligence.
I'm sure you understand.

04:20.563 --> 04:25.767
These papers won't be filed with the
court unless you fulfill our arrangement.

04:25.835 --> 04:32.338
I assure you... you'll get all
you need to put the Tobins away.

04:39.378 --> 04:41.012
Hello, Patty.

04:41.013 --> 04:44.114
I'm surprised you're
still in the city.

04:44.115 --> 04:50.085
I called you because I wanted
to thank you for your generosity.

04:50.153 --> 04:55.556
I got this for Michael.
He always wanted a Jaguar.

04:57.024 --> 04:59.792
You don't want to do
this, Jill.

04:59.793 --> 05:01.993
We moved into a
three-bedroom.

05:01.994 --> 05:05.529
You will adore what we're doing
with the nursery.

05:05.530 --> 05:10.032
When you accepted my money,
you knew what my terms were.

05:10.033 --> 05:15.170
Yeah, and I thought about them- I
really did- but I'm not going anywhere.

05:15.238 --> 05:18.239
Michael and I are having this
baby.

05:18.240 --> 05:22.343
Don't think you can dictate the
terms of our relationship.

05:22.411 --> 05:25.412
I can play power games, too,
Patty.

05:25.413 --> 05:27.981
Does Michael know
about the money?

05:27.982 --> 05:32.484
No. I didn't tell him that
you tried to buy me off.

05:32.485 --> 05:36.187
Would you like me to?

05:38.624 --> 05:42.192
My baby shower is next week.

05:42.260 --> 05:45.728
But, please, no gifts.

05:56.907 --> 06:00.210
Mr. DiFolco.
It's nice to see you again.

06:00.211 --> 06:03.012
How are you?

06:07.318 --> 06:10.320
Did you tell Mr. Zedeck that
I wanted to meet him?

06:10.321 --> 06:11.321
Sorry.

06:11.322 --> 06:15.158
Like I said, he's a busy man.

06:15.225 --> 06:21.297
Well, I appreciate him taking time
out of his schedule to come by.

06:21.365 --> 06:22.665
When was that?

06:22.666 --> 06:25.568
The other day.
He made a withdrawal himself.

06:25.569 --> 06:28.903
He's a very nice man.

06:32.207 --> 06:34.775
This guy said he was
me?

06:34.776 --> 06:39.612
He knew exactly which
account, exactly what to say.

06:39.679 --> 06:43.417
But the bank has
everything about me on file.

06:43.484 --> 06:47.052
My age, my social security
number.

06:47.053 --> 06:48.888
They didn't check this guy out?

06:48.889 --> 06:53.559
I was told he was the right
age and he had credentials.

06:53.560 --> 06:55.928
What kind of
credentials?

06:55.929 --> 07:01.700
He forged a passport using
all Mr. Zedeck's information.

07:03.670 --> 07:06.738
Lenny knew about the
account.

07:09.274 --> 07:13.510
You should have never
cut Lenny off.

07:13.577 --> 07:17.614
You turned him against us, Joe.

07:17.682 --> 07:20.350
What the hell is
he going to do next?

07:20.351 --> 07:22.419
We need to find him.

07:22.486 --> 07:25.856
See what you can do,
Ben.

07:41.136 --> 07:44.539
Long time, Parsons.

07:44.606 --> 07:48.708
Thanks for calling
me back.

07:54.080 --> 07:55.947
How have you been?

07:55.948 --> 07:58.451
You know... busy.

07:58.519 --> 08:01.355
Lot of traveling.

08:03.822 --> 08:07.050
I'm sorry I disappeared on you
the way I did.

08:07.051 --> 08:09.514
Why did you call?

08:09.582 --> 08:14.541
You never told me
you were a cop.

08:14.609 --> 08:21.580
Yeah, well, I guess, um, there's a lot of
things that I couldn't tell you back then.

08:21.648 --> 08:27.051
For example,
Detective Rick Messer?

08:27.119 --> 08:29.887
How do you know about
him?

08:29.888 --> 08:34.291
He came to me about
my fiancÃ©'s murder.

08:34.359 --> 08:40.763
He thought he had a suspect.
Ellen...

08:40.831 --> 08:46.201
Messer killed your fiancÃ©.

08:46.269 --> 08:51.472
And Frobisher was behind it,
just like you thought.

08:58.846 --> 09:03.749
How do you fit into
all of this?

09:05.918 --> 09:09.353
Messer was my partner
years back.

09:09.388 --> 09:12.490
He had some dirt on me.

09:12.557 --> 09:17.494
When I was a rookie, I pulled some
shit I could have gone to jail for.

09:17.495 --> 09:20.863
Messer knew about it.
He had leverage on me.

09:20.864 --> 09:26.502
He asked me to track you, make sure
you weren't getting close to Frobisher.

09:26.503 --> 09:30.839
So, you were lying
to me from the beginning?

09:30.907 --> 09:33.508
Sorry.

09:33.576 --> 09:37.344
And so, what
happened between us was...

09:37.346 --> 09:40.047
That was real.

09:43.251 --> 09:46.253
So I switched sides.

09:49.290 --> 09:54.660
You killed Messer,
didn't you?

09:54.728 --> 09:57.929
I can link Frobisher
to Messer.

09:57.930 --> 10:02.065
I can put Frobisher away for
David's murder.

10:04.068 --> 10:08.504
But you would have
to give yourself up to do it.

10:11.474 --> 10:17.510
Don't.

10:17.578 --> 10:20.946
I've let go.

10:21.013 --> 10:24.415
I had to.

10:24.482 --> 10:31.152
And you going to jail- that's
not going to bring back David.

10:35.757 --> 10:36.857
Key.

10:36.858 --> 10:38.892
Here's the title.
Thank you.

10:38.893 --> 10:41.929
Once you register this bad boy to your
name and address, you're good to go.

10:41.930 --> 10:44.231
Great.
Appreciate it.

10:44.232 --> 10:47.300
Um, can this come off?

10:47.368 --> 10:49.268
Yeah, but I'd leave it.

10:49.303 --> 10:52.036
Why is that?
It's good luck.

10:52.037 --> 10:55.401
89,000 miles without a scratch.

11:13.748 --> 11:14.914
We're all set.

11:14.915 --> 11:19.851
Winstone will deliver the evidence
and the money to me at the loft.

11:19.852 --> 11:23.354
Then I'll pick it up and
bring it to you. I'll be here.

11:23.355 --> 11:27.490
Don't use your own car. I
don't want you being followed.

11:27.557 --> 11:31.527
- It's parked out front.
- Okay.

11:33.928 --> 11:36.895
What is it?

11:36.963 --> 11:41.632
The two of you have
been talking to Winstone.

11:41.700 --> 11:45.101
Are you sure we can trust him?

11:46.737 --> 11:50.006
There's always a
risk.

11:50.073 --> 11:53.642
It's a risk I got to
take.

11:57.479 --> 12:02.118
All right.
Let's do it.

12:05.506 --> 12:08.808
Ah, thank you,
Farook, beautiful.

12:08.876 --> 12:13.880
Oh, hey, you want a shawarma?
It's the best meal in town.

12:13.947 --> 12:16.785
We couldn't meet
anywhere more private, huh?

12:16.786 --> 12:20.590
Yeah, I prefer
talking to you in public.

12:20.658 --> 12:23.493
Mmm! Thank you.

12:23.560 --> 12:27.730
I was sorry to hear what
happened to our bearded friend.

12:27.798 --> 12:30.432
It's a real tragedy
when a police officer dies.

12:30.433 --> 12:33.483
Yeah, although I didn't
even know he was a cop

12:33.484 --> 12:36.533
until I read about the
shooting in the paper.

12:36.534 --> 12:38.299
You know, what are we doing
here?

12:38.300 --> 12:39.666
Why did you call me?

12:39.667 --> 12:43.835
David Connor,
Ellen Parsons' fiancÃ©.

12:43.903 --> 12:45.336
Goddamn it, man.

12:45.337 --> 12:47.438
This just won't go away,
will it?

12:47.439 --> 12:49.473
You can make it
go away.

12:49.474 --> 12:52.175
How?
Turn yourself in.

12:54.645 --> 12:58.148
Messer and I went back a long
way.

12:58.149 --> 13:03.187
I know he killed David Connor
on your orders.

13:03.255 --> 13:06.056
Let me ask
you something.

13:06.058 --> 13:09.327
Who killed Rick Messer?

13:09.394 --> 13:10.894
He was shot in the
line of duty.

13:10.895 --> 13:13.895
Is that what you think?
'Cause I don't.

13:13.896 --> 13:16.964
See, before he died, Messer
told me that you turned on him.

13:16.966 --> 13:17.966
He didn't trust you anymore.

13:17.967 --> 13:22.238
That you were actually
protecting Ellen Parsons.

13:24.976 --> 13:28.743
Now, if I were you, I'd
be very, very careful.

13:28.744 --> 13:33.747
In the eyes of the law, there's
nothing worse than a cop killer.

13:42.089 --> 13:45.123
The little piece of shit
is stealing money from us.

13:45.124 --> 13:47.025
No, no, Lenny would
never do that.

13:47.026 --> 13:47.991
Mom, wake up.

13:47.992 --> 13:50.724
He turned on me, now he's
trying to wipe us out.

13:50.725 --> 13:52.125
Lenny worshipped
your father.

13:52.126 --> 13:54.127
Dad was an idiot.

13:55.729 --> 13:59.431
Everything your
father did, he did for you.

14:03.601 --> 14:06.704
Sweetheart, are you okay?

14:09.975 --> 14:12.010
I'm sorry, Rachel.

14:12.077 --> 14:15.616
Could you give me just a few
minutes with my family?

14:15.617 --> 14:19.353
Dad, what's going on?

14:19.421 --> 14:21.722
There's something I
need to tell you.

14:21.723 --> 14:24.125
How could this
happen?

14:24.126 --> 14:25.827
It was all a fraud?

14:25.828 --> 14:30.065
Why did you do it?

14:30.133 --> 14:31.433
Joe.

14:31.434 --> 14:33.968
What do you mean?

14:34.036 --> 14:38.138
Joe is not a
businessman, never was.

14:38.205 --> 14:41.305
He made a mistake years ago
when he was drinking.

14:41.306 --> 14:43.040
What kind of
mistake?

14:43.041 --> 14:45.242
You know how he was
back then.

14:45.243 --> 14:47.344
He had to be the big shot.

14:47.412 --> 14:51.813
He promised investors returns
he could never deliver.

14:51.881 --> 14:54.147
And you didn't want
him to fail.

14:54.148 --> 14:57.784
Lenny and I had
to get creative.

14:57.785 --> 15:03.121
We paid out the returns Joe
promised with other funds.

15:03.189 --> 15:04.489
Louis...

15:04.490 --> 15:08.759
We thought if we had a few months,
we could set things right, but...

15:08.760 --> 15:10.994
You never told Joe?

15:11.062 --> 15:15.129
No, and I don't
want him to know.

15:15.130 --> 15:20.933
Why the hell didn't
you tell me this before?

15:24.003 --> 15:26.637
You've been lying to me
since Thanksgiving.

15:26.638 --> 15:27.738
What are you doing?

15:27.739 --> 15:30.741
Joe, please, don't.

15:30.808 --> 15:34.176
Oh, Joe, please don't.

15:46.355 --> 15:49.289
I see what you did.

15:49.357 --> 15:54.794
You knew if you told me the truth,
that I would turn the money in.

15:54.862 --> 15:59.033
But you didn't want to live
like that, right?

15:59.101 --> 16:01.002
What else haven't you told me?

16:01.069 --> 16:02.436
Nothing.

16:02.437 --> 16:04.438
There's nothing.

16:06.908 --> 16:10.776
It's on your head now.
Yours.

16:10.778 --> 16:15.742
Everything that's happened,
you live with it. Alone.

16:18.045 --> 16:20.346
Please, Joe.

16:20.413 --> 16:23.381
I told you from
the very beginning

16:23.382 --> 16:26.349
what would happen if
you kept lying to me.

16:26.417 --> 16:27.183
No, please.

16:27.184 --> 16:28.817
You're not gonna see
your grandson again.

16:28.818 --> 16:29.584
Oh, please, Joe.

16:29.585 --> 16:30.985
You're not gonna see
Rachel again.

16:30.986 --> 16:31.653
No, please.

16:31.654 --> 16:33.055
You're not gonna
see me again.

16:33.056 --> 16:34.258
You are dead to me.

16:34.259 --> 16:35.761
No, please!

16:35.762 --> 16:38.834
Get out.

16:38.901 --> 16:40.904
Get out!

16:51.381 --> 16:53.616
Please don't do
this to me.

16:53.617 --> 16:55.618
Get out.

17:04.191 --> 17:06.157
Uh, just hang
on a sec.

17:06.159 --> 17:07.023
I'll let you out.

17:07.025 --> 17:07.723
Thanks, babe.

17:07.723 --> 17:10.490
It's like getting out
of a beanbag these days.

17:16.931 --> 17:18.830
Jill Burnham?

17:20.066 --> 17:22.066
Get out the car, ma'am.

17:23.935 --> 17:25.336
What...?

17:25.337 --> 17:27.271
Hey, what the hell's
going on?

17:27.271 --> 17:30.107
We're taking Ms. Burnham
into custody.

17:37.449 --> 17:39.650
I knew this had
to be you.

17:39.651 --> 17:41.551
How intuitive.

17:41.619 --> 17:45.155
They won't tell me
why I'm being held.

17:45.156 --> 17:48.459
I asked them to let
me do the honors.

17:48.460 --> 17:50.528
I have connections.

17:50.595 --> 17:55.032
And you think you're doing this to
me, but it's your son you're hurting.

17:55.033 --> 17:58.802
You hurt my son.
You had sex with him.

17:58.870 --> 18:00.837
It was always
consensual.

18:00.838 --> 18:06.241
Sexual intercourse with a
minor is never consensual.

18:06.309 --> 18:08.476
And you're going to prison.

18:08.543 --> 18:12.845
Michael would never
testify against me.

18:12.846 --> 18:15.447
I don't need him to.

18:18.550 --> 18:23.118
He sent me chromosomal tests to
convince me that he was the father.

18:23.120 --> 18:31.724
The date of conception is the
only proof I need to put you away.

18:31.792 --> 18:35.329
All right, all right,
I'll give you back your money.

18:35.330 --> 18:36.096
All of it.

18:36.097 --> 18:38.667
I don't care about
the money.

18:38.668 --> 18:41.970
I've already seized the car
and the apartment.

18:41.971 --> 18:43.672
Well, then I'll just
go.

18:43.673 --> 18:46.040
I'll leave the city like
you wanted.

18:46.041 --> 18:47.275
It's too late.

18:47.276 --> 18:52.615
And when the baby's born in prison,
Michael will have sole custody.

18:52.616 --> 18:55.450
And you think that's
what Michael wants?

18:55.451 --> 18:59.687
How could he
possibly know what he wants?

18:59.755 --> 19:01.689
You're despicable...

19:01.757 --> 19:03.657
and you're a criminal.

19:03.725 --> 19:10.330
And you forced my son to make a choice
he should never have had to make.

19:10.331 --> 19:12.866
Michael can't take
care of a baby alone.

19:12.867 --> 19:14.767
He's-he's not ready for that.

19:14.768 --> 19:16.168
No, he's not.

19:16.169 --> 19:20.572
But I'll make sure he has
plenty of help.

19:20.639 --> 19:26.543
You'll be out of this baby's life,
and Michael will be out of yours.

19:26.611 --> 19:28.712
Please.

19:41.122 --> 19:43.623
What can I do for you,
Mrs. Tobin?

19:43.624 --> 19:47.693
If I confess, will
you leave Joe alone?

19:49.229 --> 19:52.165
- Confess to what?
- The Ponzi scheme.

19:52.166 --> 19:56.036
I'm guilty. I knew all
about it from the beginning.

19:56.037 --> 19:58.270
I'm not sure
I believe that.

19:58.271 --> 20:02.774
What if I tell
you more?

20:04.276 --> 20:08.580
There are other crimes,
Ms. Hewes.

20:08.648 --> 20:15.420
Tessa Marchetti...
I had her killed.

20:15.488 --> 20:18.123
It's true.

20:18.190 --> 20:23.028
I did it so that Joe would never
find out...

20:23.095 --> 20:25.997
Find out what?

20:26.064 --> 20:31.434
That Tessa...
was his daughter.

20:38.207 --> 20:42.543
Years ago, Danielle came to
me when Joe got her pregnant.

20:42.611 --> 20:43.678
She hadn't told him.

20:43.679 --> 20:45.879
And I didn't want Joe saddled
with a child.

20:45.880 --> 20:47.147
It would have ruined him.

20:47.148 --> 20:53.085
So I had Louis pay her to make
the baby go away.

20:53.153 --> 20:55.888
I see.

20:55.955 --> 20:58.723
But on Thanksgiving,
I learned that...

20:58.724 --> 21:01.492
that Louis hadn't
gone through with it.

21:01.494 --> 21:04.261
He let Danielle have the baby.

21:04.329 --> 21:09.899
Danielle was never Louis'
mistress, for God's sake.

21:09.967 --> 21:13.168
He...

21:13.236 --> 21:17.238
he supported her because
Tessa was his granddaughter.

21:19.841 --> 21:23.043
Please, Ms. Hewes, leave my son
son alone.

21:23.044 --> 21:28.347
Take me instead.
I'm responsible.

21:28.348 --> 21:30.249
I'm the one you want.

21:30.317 --> 21:35.989
I'm sorry, Mrs.
Tobin, but you're not.

21:36.057 --> 21:38.058
I want Joe.

21:44.298 --> 21:47.134
So, Terry told me about
what happened.

21:47.135 --> 21:49.970
The little escapade in
your Escalade?

21:49.971 --> 21:53.340
I thought it was fascinating.
Really?

21:53.407 --> 21:54.641
Oh, yeah.

21:54.642 --> 22:00.146
I've always thought a man has to
be awful if he wants to be great.

22:04.050 --> 22:07.551
So tell me, what's the worst
thing you've ever done?

22:09.254 --> 22:12.756
Why don't you and
I go for a ride in my Escalade?

22:12.824 --> 22:18.595
You can ask all your questions, and
I'll give you all sorts of answers.

22:22.634 --> 22:24.635
I'll get my coat.

22:26.604 --> 22:28.872
Oh, man.

22:31.510 --> 22:33.611
Boy, you never learn.

22:36.015 --> 22:39.251
Always so eager to have people
like you.

22:39.252 --> 22:40.752
I haven't told her
anything.

22:40.753 --> 22:42.320
Oh, you've said
plenty.

22:42.321 --> 22:44.222
Yeah, you need
to relax, man.

22:44.223 --> 22:48.092
You're the one lying in the
ground with a hole in your head.

22:51.261 --> 22:53.796
You know, my life turned out
just fine.

22:53.797 --> 22:56.365
For now.

22:56.433 --> 22:58.836
Nice talking
to you, Ray.

22:58.837 --> 23:05.616
I've got a date with a very sexy lady
who's intrigued with my depravity.

23:05.618 --> 23:08.237
So why don't you just buy
yourself a fruity drink,

23:08.238 --> 23:10.856
flirt with the waiter
and have some fun?

23:10.857 --> 23:13.358
For Christ's sake, it's
New York City, man.

23:13.359 --> 23:16.364
Come on.

23:16.431 --> 23:17.432
Take care.

23:17.433 --> 23:21.402
Yeah, all right.

23:21.469 --> 23:23.470
I'll see you around.

23:32.647 --> 23:34.415
Did you sign
the immunity papers?

23:34.416 --> 23:41.388
Got it right here.
What's wrong?

23:41.456 --> 23:46.125
I don't trust Tom Shayes and
I don't trust Patty Hewes.

23:46.126 --> 23:50.930
She's made it clear she wants
to take me down with the Tobins.

23:50.998 --> 23:52.965
Why do you trust me?

23:53.033 --> 23:55.768
You worked for
Patty and left.

23:58.206 --> 24:00.040
I imagine you had good reason.

24:00.041 --> 24:04.879
I did.
Don't worry.

24:04.880 --> 24:07.315
This case is going to make my
career.

24:07.316 --> 24:10.718
I have no reason to share it
with Patty.

24:10.753 --> 24:15.157
Well, I admire
that.

24:15.225 --> 24:19.094
I'm a big believer in ambition.

24:19.162 --> 24:24.066
You'll give Tom his
money and the evidence...

24:24.134 --> 24:27.270
I'll take it straight to the
district attorney.

24:29.874 --> 24:31.375
All right.

24:31.376 --> 24:37.615
Before we go through with this,
Mr. Winstone, what is the evidence?

24:42.988 --> 24:46.541
The night he died, Louis
Tobin left an envelope

24:46.542 --> 24:50.095
with all the
details of the fraud.

24:50.096 --> 24:52.130
Why did he do that?

24:52.198 --> 24:55.166
He was going to
confess.

24:55.234 --> 24:59.270
And then Joe found the envelope
and kept it.

24:59.338 --> 25:01.573
So you don't have
the evidence.

25:01.574 --> 25:08.546
I know where it is.
I'll let you know when I get it.

25:10.783 --> 25:13.617
The immunity agreement.

25:13.685 --> 25:16.429
Thank you, Ms. Parsons.

25:36.630 --> 25:39.129
Tom, how
long have you been with me now?

25:39.130 --> 25:41.094
Almost 11 years.

25:41.160 --> 25:43.557
It's time to put your
name on the door.

25:43.558 --> 25:46.320
Thank you, thank you.

25:46.388 --> 25:48.288
You don't have to
worry about me.

25:48.323 --> 25:49.588
I forgave you.

25:49.589 --> 25:51.590
All your secrets are safe.

25:54.328 --> 25:57.162
People either leave
you or they die.

25:57.163 --> 26:00.832
Those are the only two endings
possible with you.

26:06.771 --> 26:10.640
What time did she say
she was gonna meet us here?

26:10.708 --> 26:13.143
She's 20 minutes
late.

26:13.144 --> 26:15.144
Jesus.

26:25.554 --> 26:28.823
Maintenance.

26:28.891 --> 26:31.492
Mr. Tobin?

26:31.560 --> 26:33.560
Hello?

27:03.650 --> 27:04.348
What's wrong?

27:04.349 --> 27:08.115
Why are we meeting here?

27:08.182 --> 27:10.950
I want you to call
off the deal with Winstone.

27:10.951 --> 27:12.252
What?

27:12.253 --> 27:13.053
Why now?

27:13.054 --> 27:13.954
What's changed?

27:13.955 --> 27:18.322
The case is over if
we don't go through with this.

27:18.390 --> 27:20.858
Then the case is over.

27:20.926 --> 27:22.426
Look, Patty,
it's-it's...

27:22.427 --> 27:24.328
I don't understand what you're
doing.

27:24.329 --> 27:27.664
Tom, whatever you and your
family need, I can provide.

27:27.732 --> 27:30.334
- I can help you.
- I don't want your help.

27:30.335 --> 27:34.738
I'm telling you, call
it off.

27:42.881 --> 27:46.150
You two should go for a walk;
it's a beautiful night.

27:58.938 --> 28:01.872
I understand, Officer. I'll
file a report. Thank you.

28:01.873 --> 28:04.141
What was that?
My bag's missing.

28:04.142 --> 28:06.376
I think it's been stolen. I
have to fill out some paperwork.

28:06.377 --> 28:09.482
- What's up?
- I spoke to Patty. The deal's back on.

28:09.483 --> 28:10.816
She changed her
mind?

28:10.817 --> 28:13.585
I convinced her to
let me go through with it.

28:13.652 --> 28:15.753
What are you
talking about, Tom?

28:15.754 --> 28:20.256
Look, are you on
board or not?

28:20.323 --> 28:23.792
I need you.

28:23.860 --> 28:26.162
Okay.

28:26.230 --> 28:28.564
Good. Thanks. You
know what to do.

28:31.868 --> 28:34.969
Yeah, hey, the
meeting went great.

28:35.004 --> 28:37.638
Yeah, I'll be home in about 20
minutes.

28:37.639 --> 28:39.640
All right.

28:42.676 --> 28:46.845
Oh, Jesus Christ.
Give me the keys.

28:51.815 --> 28:53.882
Know what, I gave you a chance
to come clean.

28:53.883 --> 28:55.216
Wait.

28:55.217 --> 28:57.718
One million, cash.
Just give me a couple hours.

28:57.719 --> 29:00.989
I don't want money.
Spoke to Ellen Parsons.

29:00.990 --> 29:02.825
Oh, shit.

29:02.826 --> 29:05.594
She's not looking
for justice.

29:05.595 --> 29:07.196
Well, then why
are we doing this?

29:07.197 --> 29:10.631
But... I'd like her
to have some anyway.

29:10.632 --> 29:12.466
No, wait, wait,
wait, don't!

29:12.467 --> 29:13.867
Wait, please.
Come on.

29:13.868 --> 29:18.070
Let me-let me just explain
something, all right? All right?

29:18.071 --> 29:21.273
Go ahead. Tell me why
you deserve to live.

29:21.341 --> 29:22.974
Come on.
Damn it, listen to me!

29:22.975 --> 29:26.742
I am a better person now!
I- I... I am-I am... I'm

29:26.809 --> 29:29.777
volunteering, like, three times
a week at this... at this

29:29.778 --> 29:31.512
you-youth thing.

29:31.513 --> 29:34.415
And I'm-I'm, like, a coach of
Little League, man.

29:34.416 --> 29:38.452
I'm working my ass off on
this whole environmental thing.

29:38.453 --> 29:40.454
And-and I'm changing lives.

29:44.994 --> 29:47.263
No, no! No!
No, please, don't, please.

29:47.264 --> 29:50.766
Oh, God!

29:50.834 --> 29:53.202
Please, don't.

29:55.205 --> 29:56.838
Please, don't!

29:56.839 --> 30:00.407
Oh, God.
I don't want to die.

30:10.821 --> 30:13.054
I'd like to help
solve a murder.

30:13.055 --> 30:15.256
What?

30:15.324 --> 30:19.060
You know what...
make it two.

30:19.061 --> 30:20.762
What are you...?

30:20.763 --> 30:24.867
David Connor.
Detective Rick Messer.

30:58.801 --> 31:00.802
Let's do this fast.

31:03.239 --> 31:04.539
It's all here?

31:04.540 --> 31:05.973
All of it.

31:05.974 --> 31:07.641
Good.

31:07.642 --> 31:09.976
I'm a man of my
word.

31:09.977 --> 31:11.978
Tom's going through
with it.

31:11.979 --> 31:14.280
I'm going to help him.

31:21.824 --> 31:25.862
I see the cowboy
turned you in.

31:25.930 --> 31:29.035
What are they
gonna do to me, Ray?

31:29.103 --> 31:30.669
You had someone
murdered.

31:30.670 --> 31:35.038
What do you think they're gonna
do?

31:35.106 --> 31:37.873
I- I've been
through trials before.

31:37.874 --> 31:39.942
I'll land on my feet, right?

31:42.277 --> 31:43.511
We'll get out of this.

31:43.512 --> 31:44.578
We'll find a way.

31:44.579 --> 31:46.012
We always do.

31:46.013 --> 31:48.747
I've always admired
that about you, Art.

31:48.748 --> 31:50.249
What?

31:50.250 --> 31:52.385
Your eternal optimism.

31:52.454 --> 31:55.492
Well, goddamn
right I'm optimistic.

31:55.560 --> 31:57.560
This is America, for Christ's
sake.

31:57.561 --> 31:59.929
Everything's possible.

31:59.997 --> 32:01.997
Not this time.

32:06.702 --> 32:08.602
Ellen?

32:08.771 --> 32:10.772
Tom Shayes.

32:12.774 --> 32:14.875
Who the hell are you?

32:14.943 --> 32:19.412
I'm looking for Leonard
Winstone.

32:19.480 --> 32:21.347
Where is he?

32:21.348 --> 32:23.982
I have no idea.
He owns these lofts.

32:23.983 --> 32:27.085
Don't tell me you don't know
where he is.

32:34.159 --> 32:35.893
That bag looks familiar.

32:35.894 --> 32:40.631
I think I remember seeing Winstone
use it to carry his cash in.

32:40.699 --> 32:43.101
You two strike up some kind of
bargain?

32:43.102 --> 32:45.002
This money's mine.

32:45.070 --> 32:47.405
I don't give a shit
about the money.

32:47.406 --> 32:49.039
There's plenty more where that
came from.

32:49.040 --> 32:51.242
I want Winstone.

33:23.864 --> 33:26.398
Tom?

33:26.466 --> 33:32.036
Look, let me just take care of her,
I'll tell you exactly where Winstone is.

33:32.238 --> 33:33.005
Tom?

33:33.006 --> 33:36.575
She's a friend.
She's just here for the money.

33:36.643 --> 33:38.644
Tom?

33:47.621 --> 33:48.754
Tom?

33:48.755 --> 33:51.891
You here?

33:51.959 --> 33:54.527
Is that the money?

33:57.799 --> 33:59.500
Does Patty know about this?

33:59.501 --> 34:01.135
Don't worry about
Patty.

34:01.136 --> 34:03.471
Do you still want
me to take this to her?

34:03.472 --> 34:05.473
Yes, just go.

34:33.301 --> 34:39.840
Now where's Winstone?
I have no idea.

34:57.560 --> 34:59.460
No!

35:06.766 --> 35:10.230
Mr. Zedeck, Winstone's
not here.

35:10.231 --> 35:14.564
But you should tell Joe Tobin that I think
he's made some kind of deal with Tom Shayes.

35:15.864 --> 35:19.199
That's what I'm trying to figure
out.

35:23.903 --> 35:25.704
I know you got the money.

35:25.705 --> 35:28.172
What did Winstone get in return?

35:28.240 --> 35:30.241
Nothing.

35:35.613 --> 35:39.248
Did Winstone give you
evidence against the Tobins?

35:39.316 --> 35:41.984
No.

35:50.560 --> 35:54.662
You better start talking, 'cause the
next one's going to go in your throat.

35:56.065 --> 35:59.834
What did Winstone get from the
deal?

36:08.042 --> 36:10.143
You son of a bitch.

37:05.494 --> 37:07.228
Oh, shit.

37:07.229 --> 37:10.732
Where's the envelope?

37:10.800 --> 37:13.368
Patty?

37:17.106 --> 37:18.273
Patty.

37:18.274 --> 37:21.676
Winstone didn't give Tom the
evidence.

37:24.643 --> 37:25.643
Michael.

37:25.644 --> 37:28.112
Where is she?
Where the hell is my mother?

37:28.113 --> 37:30.615
I don't know.
She's not answering her phone.

37:30.616 --> 37:32.651
She had Jill
arrested.

37:32.652 --> 37:34.620
That's the mother of my goddamn
baby.

37:34.621 --> 37:35.486
I'm sorry.

37:35.487 --> 37:38.353
If you find her,
tell her I need to talk to her.

37:38.354 --> 37:40.655
I will.
I have to go.

37:40.656 --> 37:44.224
I swear to God I'm
going to kill her.

37:48.228 --> 37:49.896
Jesus, Tommy.

37:49.897 --> 37:52.998
You're messed up.

37:53.066 --> 37:55.066
Where did you get
this?

37:57.102 --> 37:58.401
It's Ellen's.

37:58.402 --> 38:00.335
Where... where is she?
Is she okay?

38:00.336 --> 38:01.303
She drove off.

38:01.304 --> 38:02.604
She's fine.

38:02.605 --> 38:03.905
Good.

38:03.906 --> 38:05.806
Make sure this gets back to her.

38:05.807 --> 38:10.143
Listen, Barry, uh,
upstairs, there...

38:10.144 --> 38:14.479
there's something I
need you to do for me.

38:32.063 --> 38:33.563
Hello?

38:33.564 --> 38:34.898
Ellen.

38:34.899 --> 38:38.000
Patty?

38:43.271 --> 38:45.272
Patty, where are
you?

38:45.273 --> 38:46.072
I'm on my way home.

38:46.073 --> 38:46.806
We can talk when I get there.

38:46.807 --> 38:48.174
I need to talk to
you now.

38:48.175 --> 38:49.542
Patty. I don't have the
documents.

38:49.543 --> 38:51.276
Michael wants to meet
me at the apartment.

38:51.277 --> 38:52.410
Patty, I...

38:52.411 --> 38:53.078
Shit.

38:53.079 --> 38:54.979
Michael!

38:59.784 --> 39:02.786
No, they didn't ask about
the... he lied about the steroid

39:02.787 --> 39:05.789
use, and then he came back
and said, "Yeah, I did it."

39:05.790 --> 39:09.691
You've reached the Shayes'
family. Please leave a message.

39:12.328 --> 39:18.665
I just, uh... uh... wanted to
tell you that I... I love you, Deb.

39:19.066 --> 39:20.399
But I made a mistake.

39:20.400 --> 39:23.768
When you get this, take the
kids and don't come home.

39:28.841 --> 39:32.909
Tommy, what did you
do?

39:35.246 --> 39:39.848
I'll clean this up for you,
Tommy.

39:45.290 --> 39:47.228
Holy shit.

40:02.213 --> 40:03.948
Hey, man.

40:03.949 --> 40:07.051
Are you still with us?

40:14.359 --> 40:16.492
in an era where everyone
else is afraid to do so.

40:16.493 --> 40:18.393
Thank God for Patty...

40:45.148 --> 40:47.549
Lenny, where are you?

40:47.616 --> 40:50.284
It's over, Joe.

40:50.352 --> 40:53.019
The DA has everything they need.

40:53.087 --> 40:55.154
They'll be coming for you.

40:55.223 --> 40:57.291
Where the hell are you?

40:57.359 --> 40:59.994
Zedeck told me you made a deal
with Tom Shayes.

40:59.995 --> 41:03.897
You should say
good-bye to Rachel and Kevin.

41:06.300 --> 41:09.635
I never wanted it to be this
way, Joe.

41:09.636 --> 41:10.736
I'm sorry.

41:10.737 --> 41:12.804
You listen to me, you...

41:12.872 --> 41:14.439
Lenny?

41:14.440 --> 41:17.676
Lenny!

41:17.744 --> 41:20.846
Lenny?

41:28.086 --> 41:31.203
I understand it was
quite a nasty car accident.

41:31.238 --> 41:35.052
Do you think this could have
been done to you on purpose?

41:35.120 --> 41:38.456
I have no idea.

41:52.068 --> 41:55.003
Michael?

42:04.044 --> 42:05.944
Deb!

42:07.147 --> 42:08.280
Deb.

42:08.281 --> 42:09.681
Are you okay?

42:09.682 --> 42:11.983
Deb.

42:13.819 --> 42:15.719
Is anybody here?

42:37.507 --> 42:42.543
You made a little deal with Lenny...
Lenny Winstone, didn't you, Tom?

42:42.545 --> 42:45.748
Get out.

42:45.815 --> 42:48.450
A very nice house you
have here, hmm?

42:48.451 --> 42:50.452
Yeah, it's for sale.
You want it?

42:50.453 --> 42:53.389
I had a nice house, but
you took it, didn't you?

42:53.390 --> 42:56.392
I'm just trying to get back
what's mine.

42:56.393 --> 42:59.161
Nothing was ever
yours.

42:59.162 --> 43:01.163
Your father stole it and gave
it to you.

43:01.164 --> 43:02.798
You don't know a goddamn
thing about my father.

43:02.799 --> 43:04.767
Except for he was a
greedy scumbag.

43:04.768 --> 43:07.803
Watch your mouth.
Get out of my house!

43:10.442 --> 43:13.909
You don't know a thing
about him.

43:19.716 --> 43:22.918
You didn't know my
father.

43:26.057 --> 43:27.957
He loved me.

43:30.795 --> 43:35.033
You didn't know my father.
He loved me.

43:35.100 --> 43:48.108
You don't know my family. Don't
know a goddamn thing about me!

44:30.146 --> 44:32.447
Oh, God.

44:40.086 --> 44:42.920
Okay, Louis.

44:50.059 --> 44:53.195
Oh, God, I was good-looking.

45:05.939 --> 45:09.374
Oh, Joe.

46:09.391 --> 46:13.426
I'm sorry for your
loss.

46:17.298 --> 46:22.801
Tom was like family...
to me, Detective.

46:32.879 --> 46:34.013
Where to?

46:34.014 --> 46:37.316
Uh... uh, take me to
the East River.

46:37.317 --> 46:38.317
Sure thing.

46:38.318 --> 46:40.386
Thanks.

46:57.943 --> 47:02.179
I want you to tell me how
this bag ended up bloody

47:02.180 --> 47:06.415
and in... in a homeless
man's shopping cart.

47:06.483 --> 47:08.850
So, please leave a
message.

47:08.851 --> 47:10.084
I don't understand!

47:10.085 --> 47:13.220
I told you not to go through
with it!

47:13.221 --> 47:14.987
I told you to stop!

47:14.988 --> 47:16.855
I told you...

47:16.856 --> 47:21.524
Maybe, you know, we could figure
this out, you know, together.

47:21.525 --> 47:25.762
I don't think I'm in the right
state of mind to help you right now.

47:36.605 --> 47:38.606
You have one new message.

47:41.309 --> 47:43.943
I told you not to
go through with it!

47:44.378 --> 47:46.278
I told you to stop!

47:47.447 --> 47:49.148
Hello?

47:49.149 --> 47:53.618
If you haven't found the documents
by now, they're in your bag.

47:53.686 --> 47:55.020
I wanted you to have them.

47:55.021 --> 47:57.488
I told you I didn't
trust Tom Shayes.

47:57.489 --> 47:59.156
Mr. Winstone?

47:59.157 --> 48:01.157
Mr. Winstone, where are you?

48:16.202 --> 48:19.603
This is the final boarding
call for Flight 328.

48:19.671 --> 48:23.308
All passengers must go to the
gate at this time.

48:23.376 --> 48:25.510
Your boarding pass, sir?

48:30.150 --> 48:33.185
Detective?

48:33.252 --> 48:36.788
My bag- what else did you find
inside it?

48:44.962 --> 48:47.631
You said a homeless man had
this.

48:47.632 --> 48:49.766
Why do you ask?

48:49.833 --> 48:54.636
Barry?

48:58.308 --> 49:00.342
You're Tommy's friend,
right?

49:00.343 --> 49:03.643
Yeah, Ellen Parsons.

49:03.711 --> 49:06.946
I got something for
you.

49:07.014 --> 49:08.781
Sorry about the bag.

49:08.782 --> 49:12.584
Tommy wanted me to
get this back to you.

49:22.428 --> 49:25.097
The police picked you
up because that's all

49:25.098 --> 49:27.766
the evidence we need
to seize the money.

49:33.773 --> 49:37.409
Did you know Tessa Marchetti
was your daughter?

49:42.247 --> 49:45.749
That's not true.

49:45.817 --> 49:51.121
I can understand why
you don't want to believe me.

49:51.189 --> 49:55.491
Your mother would have verified
it...

49:55.559 --> 49:59.330
but this morning, they pulled
her body out of the East River.

50:12.646 --> 50:16.616
The fish got to her, but you
can still recognize her face.

50:26.259 --> 50:31.630
When we first met, I believed you
actually wanted to do the right thing.

50:36.201 --> 50:38.202
I know what that's like.

50:40.572 --> 50:45.042
You want to do good, you get
backed in a corner.

50:45.110 --> 50:50.313
It can lead a person to make
unforgivable mistakes.

50:58.623 --> 51:03.195
There's only one way you'll be
able to live with yourself.

51:03.263 --> 51:06.066
I want to talk to you alone.

51:08.703 --> 51:09.603
What is she doing?

51:09.604 --> 51:12.873
She turned off the intercom.

51:12.940 --> 51:15.840
Now, listen to me,
Joe.

51:24.385 --> 51:26.219
What happened?

51:26.220 --> 51:29.489
Mr. Tobin is gonna
give you a statement.

51:33.528 --> 51:37.131
He admitted to the murder of
Tom Shayes.

51:50.045 --> 51:53.213
What did you say to
him?

51:58.751 --> 52:01.718
We talked about
confession.

52:14.240 --> 52:17.875
I know it's a crucial time
for you.

52:17.876 --> 52:20.142
Finishing law school, job
interviews.

52:20.143 --> 52:21.943
I assume you've got a bar exam
coming up.

52:21.944 --> 52:22.610
Yes, I do.

52:22.611 --> 52:27.614
But I think we can agree that being a mother
is more important than any of that, huh?

52:45.169 --> 52:49.071
It was a nice
service.

52:49.139 --> 52:53.892
I'm gonna miss Tom.

52:53.893 --> 52:58.646
This is my favorite place.

53:01.082 --> 53:04.383
When I die, I don't want to be
buried.

53:04.384 --> 53:06.852
Put in the ground.

53:06.920 --> 53:10.624
I want to be cremated.

53:10.692 --> 53:12.693
What about you?

53:15.363 --> 53:18.130
I guess I haven't
really thought about it.

53:20.134 --> 53:20.967
Of course.

53:20.968 --> 53:24.104
You're young.

53:24.171 --> 53:26.840
I want my ashes scattered here.

53:37.783 --> 53:40.384
What are you going to do next?

53:40.452 --> 53:43.519
I don't know.

53:43.586 --> 53:48.123
I could go and work at a
different law firm.

53:48.191 --> 53:52.562
Or I could come back and work
for you.

53:52.630 --> 53:54.631
Or quit the law.

53:59.203 --> 54:03.007
You're gonna have to
decide what you want.

54:05.177 --> 54:08.380
I was at a crossroads once.

54:08.447 --> 54:12.218
I told you about the daughter
I had.

54:12.285 --> 54:15.788
Julia.
You said she was stillborn.

54:19.260 --> 54:23.330
Her father is probably the only
man I've ever loved.

54:23.397 --> 54:26.433
But he didn't have my ambition.

54:26.500 --> 54:29.336
He wanted to stay
in the town where

54:29.337 --> 54:32.172
I'd gone to law school,
make a life there.

54:32.240 --> 54:36.977
But I was offered a job at a law
firm in New York.

54:37.045 --> 54:40.317
The first woman ever accepted
there.

54:40.318 --> 54:42.020
Then I got pregnant.

54:42.021 --> 54:44.526
So...

54:44.594 --> 54:46.862
I had to make a choice.

54:46.929 --> 54:52.268
Marry him and raise our child
there or...

54:52.335 --> 54:57.207
go to the city and be a single
mother.

54:57.275 --> 55:02.214
Either way I was trapped.

55:11.358 --> 55:14.561
Excuse me.

55:14.629 --> 55:17.331
You, uh, study over at the
university?

55:17.332 --> 55:18.298
Yes.

55:18.299 --> 55:19.832
The law school.

55:19.833 --> 55:21.034
My name's Decker.

55:21.035 --> 55:22.134
Patricia.

55:22.135 --> 55:23.302
Nice to meet you.

55:23.303 --> 55:27.103
Call me Julian.

55:27.171 --> 55:28.904
Sure you're ready?

55:28.905 --> 55:31.539
Baby's a big responsibility.

55:31.606 --> 55:33.440
I know it is.

55:33.441 --> 55:36.843
What are you doing
walking all the way out here?

55:36.910 --> 55:38.377
Especially in your condition.

55:38.378 --> 55:41.780
My doctor said
it would be all right.

55:45.115 --> 55:48.613
Then Julia died.

55:55.482 --> 55:58.450
How?

55:58.518 --> 56:00.518
I don't know.

56:08.192 --> 56:11.763
The doctor said I was perfectly
healthy.

56:14.767 --> 56:18.937
You're having complications, which is
why it's critical, absolutely critical,

56:18.938 --> 56:23.107
that you remain on bed rest for
the remainder of your pregnancy.

56:23.108 --> 56:28.478
No physical exertion of any kind...
whatsoever, or you could lose the baby.

56:28.479 --> 56:34.850
So if you love this child, Patricia, you will
not get out of bed till the day it is delivered.

56:34.851 --> 56:36.018
Understood?

56:36.019 --> 56:39.421
What are you doing
walking all the way out here?

56:39.488 --> 56:42.490
Especially in your condition.

56:44.593 --> 56:45.860
Understood?

56:45.861 --> 56:47.428
Yes, Doctor.

56:47.429 --> 56:48.762
I understand.

56:48.763 --> 56:52.565
You're gonna be a great
mother.

56:57.335 --> 57:02.338
I don't know why it happened,
but I was free to start my career.

57:09.478 --> 57:11.846
You know, someday...

57:11.914 --> 57:14.114
I want a family...

57:14.182 --> 57:15.449
children.

57:15.450 --> 57:19.185
It'll happen, Ellen.
I'm sure it will.

57:31.897 --> 57:35.132
I should head back
to the city.

57:37.602 --> 57:43.172
I did want to ask you one
question.

57:43.240 --> 57:45.574
What's that?

57:45.642 --> 57:48.844
It's career advice,
really.

57:52.214 --> 57:55.749
You've accomplished everything
you set out to do.

58:02.789 --> 58:05.156
Is it worth it?

58:43.678 --> 58:46.679
I'll see you, Patty.
