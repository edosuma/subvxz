01:41.422 --> 01:42.742
Newspaper.

01:47.266 --> 01:49.657
- Is it true? 
- Look yourself, sir.

01:53.311 --> 01:56.623
"Following the success of our U-boats it has been decided ..."

01:58.675 --> 02:00.667
So now we know, sir.

02:04.039 --> 02:05.188
Reception!

02:05.440 --> 02:08.275
- ... I want a room 
- A room for my wife and myself.

02:08.442 --> 02:10.080
Sorry, we are full.

02:10.243 --> 02:13.716
- But we just got married. 
- He has to join the ship tomorrow!

02:16.448 --> 02:18.724
29, but I might turn you out.

02:18.890 --> 02:19.890
Register first!

02:21.451 --> 02:22.726
¿Captain Hardt?

02:22.893 --> 02:26.046
You'll need a diving suit. He is still at sea.

02:26.335 --> 02:31.538
- The U29 moored an hour ago, sir. 
- Who would be a U-boat captain?

02:31.979 --> 02:34.370
- A letter arrives, send it to my room. 
- Very good.

02:35.542 --> 02:38.934
- Capt Rigg wants another manicure, room 46. 
- I know...

02:40.265 --> 02:41.335
Well?

02:41.506 --> 02:43.783
Captain Hardt is to report to headquarters immediately.

02:43.948 --> 02:46.020
- He hasn't arrived yet. 
- What's his room number?

02:46.190 --> 02:47.624
- 54 
- Have you seen him?

02:47.791 --> 02:48.861
Not for 16 days.

02:57.198 --> 02:59.190
- You know him by sight?
- No.

02:59.359 --> 03:01.591
Well, try the Turkish baths at Koernische.

03:01.761 --> 03:03.640
Koernische Strasse ...

03:05.804 --> 03:08.559
- Hullo; kept my room? 
- 54, Captain Hardt.

03:08.726 --> 03:10.559
- Cigarettes? 
- Sorry, Capt. We're sold out.

03:10.728 --> 03:12.367
- Again? 
- Got yet tobacco.

03:12.929 --> 03:15.809
And a beautiful pipe. Only six marks.

03:15.972 --> 03:18.807
Nothing doing it. I never smoke a pipe.

03:19.014 --> 03:22.213
- C'mon, lets bath and shape the body. 
- Did you sink any food ships?

03:22.376 --> 03:24.687
- Four. 
- Makes me hungry just to think of it.

03:35.086 --> 03:37.682
16 days without a smoke.

03:37.968 --> 03:40.848
- This is absolutely ... 
- Perfect!

03:41.811 --> 03:44.930
Food first. A cigar is best after dinner.

03:45.373 --> 03:46.443
You're always right, sir.

03:54.460 --> 03:57.374
Back again, Captain. Congratulations.

03:57.542 --> 03:59.660
- A table for two? 
- And a meal for ten.

03:59.824 --> 04:02.260
I put in the out booth. They've just gone.

04:02.826 --> 04:05.866
- Felix, darling! 
- After dinner, Schatzchen.

04:11.032 --> 04:14.690
Listen Hans: We've been 16 days in a submarine.

04:14.695 --> 04:20.178
It makes 48 tins of sardines, 768 beastly little fishes.

04:20.238 --> 04:22.152
- I could eat a horse.
- He probably did.

04:22.361 --> 04:24.717
Sorry, it's a meatless day.

04:25.363 --> 04:29.996
We'll have roast goose with foie gras,

04:30.407 --> 04:33.845
- Apple pie, plum pudding. 
- Big as a depth charge.

04:34.289 --> 04:35.963
Gentlemen... please!

04:36.251 --> 04:39.086
- Here is the menu. 
- Thank you.

04:40.534 --> 04:43.687
- Is it a joke? 
- Boiled fish!

04:44.617 --> 04:47.452
- Carrots, beets, potatoes. 
- No potatoes, sir!

04:47.519 --> 04:51.840
- Bring a pail of bread and butter. 
- No butter. Margarine tomorrow perhaps.

04:51.902 --> 04:55.614
We sank the finest food in the world

04:55.685 --> 04:57.764
Then turn to port and you give us ...

04:57.827 --> 05:01.299
- Boiled fish and carrots! 
- I agree...

05:33.613 --> 05:35.127
Fifth floor.

05:50.506 --> 05:53.944
Captain Hardt? Message from
headquarters. Report immediately.

06:03.235 --> 06:05.751
- Carry on as she goes, quartermaster. 
- As she goes, sir.

06:15.244 --> 06:18.124
What an idea, putting a 
motorbike in a submarine!

06:18.286 --> 06:20.005
11:15, sir.

06:21.688 --> 06:25.570
- 11:14. 
- Can at least open the kit pack?

06:27.173 --> 06:29.290
11:15, sir.

06:31.536 --> 06:34.291
11:15, gentlemen.

06:57.675 --> 06:59.952
What it says about the motorbike, sir?

07:04.360 --> 07:06.876
- What you got there? 
- A chart of the mine defences.

07:07.042 --> 07:10.754
And a photograph of the Old Man of Hoy;
it seems to be a rendez-vous.

07:13.407 --> 07:16.765
3* 25'. It's off my chart.

07:16.929 --> 07:19.365
- It's in mine. 
- Here.

07:21.132 --> 07:23.728
Gentlemen, we are on a special mission.

07:24.335 --> 07:28.809
Our orders are to proceed to
Scapa Flow in the Orkney Islands.

07:30.179 --> 07:34.175
It's a big job and a dangerous one. 
I know I can count on you.

07:34.342 --> 07:36.494
That's all. Thank you.

07:38.545 --> 07:40.742
Hartman, full speed ahead.

07:40.907 --> 07:42.864
- 3-2-0. 
- 3-2-0, sir.

07:43.789 --> 07:45.143
- Schuster? 
- Yes, sir.

07:45.310 --> 07:48.270
"Your" motorbike, it'll take me to Longhope,

07:48.432 --> 07:52.474
in the island of Hoy, base
of the British Grand Fleet.

07:52.916 --> 07:57.674
"Once across the minefield,
spend the night at the Man of Hoy."

07:58.760 --> 08:02.152
Lt. Schuster will take over
and wait for your return.

08:02.563 --> 08:05.637
You will proceed to the Longhope School

08:05.805 --> 08:10.678
where you will report to our agent... 
Fraulein Thiel. "

08:10.849 --> 08:12.249
A woman? How is she?

08:12.410 --> 08:14.687
- Tall, dark, 21... 
- My type, sir!

08:14.972 --> 08:18.570
- Have a shave, sir. 
- See what's in the kit pack.

08:19.415 --> 08:21.931
- I still do not see why a motorcycle. 
- Schuster ...

08:22.097 --> 08:25.996
A man landed from a submarine
would not travel by motorbike.

08:26.100 --> 08:27.773
- Ah, camouflage! 
- Ah, camouflage.

08:28.142 --> 08:31.659
A well-worn tweed, the thing for Scotland.

08:31.824 --> 08:34.544
Too big for me; fits you all right.

08:34.866 --> 08:38.544
This suit's mine! I bought it in Berlin.

08:41.952 --> 08:45.105
"Temple & Conway, Saville Row, London"

08:45.314 --> 08:48.787
"Ernest H-A-R-T"

08:48.957 --> 08:51.393
Your name, sir, spelled in the English way.

08:51.759 --> 08:55.516
Clever. Stole my own suit. 
Trying to make a spy of me.

08:55.682 --> 08:58.960
This Fraulein Thiel; is there
a photograph of her?

09:00.165 --> 09:03.843
- How would they get her into the school? 
- That's their business.

09:10.333 --> 09:12.689
Miss Anne, dear, it is nearly four.

09:12.854 --> 09:15.849
- The carrier will be here. 
- Coming!

09:16.937 --> 09:18.291
Look out!

09:18.459 --> 09:21.294
- My poor paint... 
- The handle broke.

09:21.581 --> 09:23.777
Oh, there's nothing hurt.

09:24.263 --> 09:27.223
Nanny dear, I've loved my holiday, every minute.

09:27.385 --> 09:31.940
How couldn't I know to look after your? 
I have plenty of practice.

09:32.349 --> 09:35.707
Don't stand there smiling, fix a label.

09:36.152 --> 09:37.586
I thought you might like to have this.

09:37.753 --> 09:41.590
You dropped your passport, Miss Butter Fingers.

09:41.756 --> 09:44.716
- It's a photo of John and me. 
- And you give it to me?

09:44.878 --> 09:47.678
- I have lots more. They printed thousands. 
- Beautiful!

09:48.561 --> 09:52.112
"Rvd. John Harris, vicar of St. Swithin's,"

09:52.283 --> 09:54.958
"and his fiancee, Miss Anne Burnett,"

09:55.126 --> 09:59.919
"who was appointed to the
school at Orkney Islands..."

10:00.169 --> 10:04.644
- You'll miss him, deary. 
- Oh, he's going come see
me when he got a leave.

10:10.337 --> 10:12.374
A car has stopped at the gate!

10:23.026 --> 10:24.904
Would it be too much to ask for some tea?

10:25.268 --> 10:29.230
It suits me, but you'll have to wait until
this lady is under way. Maggie, the bag.

10:29.391 --> 10:33.831
- We're waiting for the carrier. 
- To take the train to Thurston. Excuse me a minute.

10:33.994 --> 10:36.191
- Are you going up north? 
- To the Orkney Islands.

10:36.356 --> 10:38.667
- Where the fleet is, right? 
- Got a job there. I'm a teacher.

10:38.838 --> 10:41.069
- It's four o'clock! 
- My train leaves at five!

10:41.240 --> 10:44.951
How strange Sandy Ross being late. 

10:45.122 --> 10:47.354
- Sandy Ross?
- Have you seen him?

10:47.644 --> 10:51.356
We saw an old car with his name. 
He seemed to be broken down.

10:51.527 --> 10:53.007
- Where? 
- About 8 km.

10:53.248 --> 10:56.448
- God! 
- Can't catch another train?

10:56.611 --> 10:59.650
Missing the boat would mean losing a whole day!

10:59.813 --> 11:02.454
Tell Mr. McLeod! We'll take the hearse.

11:02.615 --> 11:03.810
No. Wait.

11:04.216 --> 11:06.891
- I can run you to the station. 
- It would be lovely.

11:07.059 --> 11:08.652
- What about your tea? 
- It doesn't matter.

11:08.820 --> 11:12.132
- The Providence sent you. 
- Come along.

11:12.302 --> 11:14.579
Maggie, put her things in the car!

11:14.744 --> 11:16.303
We're taking her to Dingwall.

11:16.465 --> 11:20.427
Be sure to keep warm. She's easy to catch a cold!

11:20.588 --> 11:22.785
You're a blessing in disguise.

11:23.270 --> 11:26.504
Hold your dear passport. Don't forget your woolies.

11:26.673 --> 11:28.665
- It's terribly cold out there. 
- I'll take care.

11:40.283 --> 11:43.436
- Never thought you were a teacher. 
- But I am.

11:43.766 --> 11:47.283
- I got my degree from Bristol U. 
- Then again...

11:47.809 --> 11:51.121
Had to do something after my father died. No money.

11:51.611 --> 11:54.491
- What was your father? 
- He was an architect, but not very lucky.

11:54.654 --> 11:57.375
He only had a good job; a tavern in Chester.

11:57.536 --> 11:59.971
And he didn't like it because he was a teetotaler.

12:00.938 --> 12:04.091
- You lived in Chester? 
- Yes, on Putnam Street.

12:04.821 --> 12:08.897
- The Orkney Islands; do you have friends there? 
- None.

12:09.424 --> 12:12.339
- But John will come to see me. 
- Who is John?

12:12.787 --> 12:15.349
My fiance. Want to see a photograph?

12:15.509 --> 12:16.704
Very much.

12:19.712 --> 12:21.510
He is quite good looking.

12:21.673 --> 12:25.589
Orkney Islands; I thought it was
impossible for civilians to go there.

12:25.756 --> 12:28.556
It is. It was a fuzz getting my passport.

12:28.719 --> 12:32.077
- But you got it? 
- Yes, here it is.

12:32.641 --> 12:35.681
Complete with photograph. Isn't it terrible?

12:40.167 --> 12:43.719
- Passport photographs are never flattering. 
- Haven't you taken the wrong road?

12:44.610 --> 12:46.682
- ¿Is this the route to Dingwall, Edwards?
- Yes, madam.

12:46.852 --> 12:48.844
It probably is a shortcut.

12:49.494 --> 12:51.930
- Are you sure you aren't cold? 
- No, I love it.

12:52.096 --> 12:56.729
Remember what your nanny said. 
Give Miss Burnett the shetland scarf.

13:03.104 --> 13:07.623
- Really I don't want it. 
- No, you mustn't catch cold.

13:19.596 --> 13:21.428
- Done? 
- All is in order.

13:21.838 --> 13:23.795
Well, hold on tight.

13:40.692 --> 13:43.413
Put on these clothes.

14:20.481 --> 14:23.520
- Did you see a light? 
- Where? No.

14:25.404 --> 14:29.366
- I think I heard a splash. 
- Take over.

14:32.850 --> 14:34.762
A seagull.

15:02.392 --> 15:03.746
Right, madam. We know you.

15:11.118 --> 15:12.791
- ¿Miss Anne Burnett? 
- Yes.

15:12.959 --> 15:14.360
- Schoolteacher?
- Yes.

15:14.721 --> 15:19.593
- This picture, it doesn't really do you justice. 
- I tought it as good as my other passport photos.

15:19.885 --> 15:21.205
- Destination?
- Longhope.

15:21.526 --> 15:23.245
- Age?
- 21.

15:23.407 --> 15:26.128
- Married or single? 
- Engaged.

15:26.449 --> 15:27.883
- Pass... 
- Thank you.

15:40.660 --> 15:42.811
- What about tea, Miss? 
- Yes, please.

15:42.982 --> 15:45.099
- What time we get to Longhope?
 - In about an hour, Miss.

15:45.263 --> 15:49.179
- You're only passenger 'cept for a telephone linesman.
- Thank you.

16:02.636 --> 16:03.831
Fix your pass there.

16:04.678 --> 16:06.795
- Are you in the wire patrol? 
- What do you think?

16:06.959 --> 16:08.473
- Six? 
- Six.

16:08.640 --> 16:09.994
I'll pass you.

16:14.325 --> 16:18.367
- Fine passage, James? 
- You think so, Walter?

16:18.808 --> 16:23.043
For you. All you do is stand on the bridge, but me?

16:23.411 --> 16:26.406
It is a miracle that I keep this old tub coming.

16:26.894 --> 16:31.527
When will we be in port to see them?

16:32.258 --> 16:35.058
- I'll see about that.
- I hope so.

16:36.501 --> 16:38.094
- You're the new teacher?
- Yes.

16:38.262 --> 16:41.337
It'll be a nice change from the last one. 
She was called "Wall Eyed Maggie".

16:41.505 --> 16:43.337
- You got a pass?
- Yes.

16:43.506 --> 16:46.147
I'm a special constable, you understand?

16:46.308 --> 16:48.744
See that? "Orkney Constabulary", for the duration.

16:48.910 --> 16:51.870
No one's up or down without me knowing.

16:52.112 --> 16:54.389
- Miss Anne Burnett?
- Yes.

16:54.915 --> 16:56.234
I'll pass you.

16:56.396 --> 16:59.834
Bob Bratt. Come; there's a minister
and his wife who want to meet you.

16:59.998 --> 17:02.070
- Thank you.
- I'll take it.

17:11.607 --> 17:13.519
- Shut that door!
- All right, Pier Master!

17:13.688 --> 17:15.999
This is Rvd. Hector Matthews. My wife.

17:16.170 --> 17:18.367
- How kind to meet me.
- Welcome to Longhope.

17:18.771 --> 17:22.085
We were thinking, you may prefer a room with us

17:22.255 --> 17:25.089
- To living up at the school house.
- That's very kind, but ...

17:25.257 --> 17:29.299
We thought it'd be highly improper
for so young a girl to be on her own.

17:29.460 --> 17:33.661
- I'm accustomed to look after myself.
- Mrs Matthews is a pretty housekeeper.

17:34.063 --> 17:37.138
- You'll find the charge is very reasonable.
- I'm sure of that.

17:37.306 --> 17:40.220
Shall we discuss it some other time?
Good bye.

17:41.429 --> 17:43.546
- Good bye.
- I'll put you on your road, Miss Burnett.

17:43.710 --> 17:46.067
- Shut that door!
- All right, Pier Master!

18:18.416 --> 18:20.613
- 50 feet.
- Pump up 4 auxiliary.

18:21.178 --> 18:22.578
Pump up 4 auxiliary!

18:29.264 --> 18:31.860
- Dead slow.
- Dead slow, sir.

18:32.226 --> 18:34.378
Stop the pump. Shut 4 auxiliary.

18:35.148 --> 18:37.425
Stop the pump, shut 4 auxiliary!

18:48.398 --> 18:50.709
- 80 feet!
- Flood fives.

18:51.440 --> 18:52.476
Flood fives!

19:02.448 --> 19:04.441
Hold at 80 feet.

19:15.498 --> 19:18.094
Hot? Funny how cold makes you steam.

19:20.982 --> 19:24.375
- We have scraped something, have you heard?
- You would have heard if we had.

19:36.914 --> 19:38.712
Well, gentlemen, I think we are through.

19:38.875 --> 19:41.596
Whoever got the chart of the mine
field deserves the Iron Cross.

19:41.757 --> 19:44.148
Yes, we shouldn't have even
a wood one without it.

19:44.960 --> 19:46.519
Stop motors.

19:47.001 --> 19:49.471
Stopped boat, sir!

19:50.884 --> 19:52.716
Can you hear anything?

19:55.688 --> 19:58.727
No, sir. Nothing.

19:58.890 --> 20:01.406
- Good. I'm going up. 30 feet.
- 30 feet, sir!

20:01.572 --> 20:03.052
Up periscope.

20:06.896 --> 20:09.332
- Stand by to surface.
- Stand by to surface!

20:11.259 --> 20:14.094
- Main vents shut, sir!
- Blow ones.

20:16.423 --> 20:19.383
- Blow twos and threes.
- Blow twos and threes!

20:21.106 --> 20:22.985
25...

20:25.469 --> 20:27.029
20...

20:27.551 --> 20:30.863
- 15 ...
- Stop blowing. Exit stations!

20:43.603 --> 20:47.645
- We review the details?
- Do you think I'll forget?

20:47.846 --> 20:51.158
To be sure. Ready? On top of the cliff?

20:51.809 --> 20:54.564
- Northeast, surrounding rocks.
- Then?

20:54.731 --> 20:57.531
Follow telegraph poles. Rough road.

20:57.693 --> 20:59.606
- 3 miles?
- Right.

20:59.775 --> 21:02.416
At the fork, turn left.

21:02.577 --> 21:05.935
- In the cairn?
- Stop and look for the sign W-NW.

21:06.099 --> 21:07.693
- The woman?
- Fraulein Thiel.

21:07.861 --> 21:10.502
- Motorcycle is asshore, sir.
- Password?

21:10.863 --> 21:13.584
I do not know what spell makes me so sad...

21:14.986 --> 21:19.619
- What are you smiling at?
- You sir, saying that in the dark to a woman.

21:20.310 --> 21:23.907
If you are so funny, keep it. Come on.

21:26.474 --> 21:28.865
Come up at same time next 3 nights.

21:29.036 --> 21:30.231
Yes, sir.

21:30.798 --> 21:33.029
- Got everything you want?
- Yes.

21:33.560 --> 21:36.201
- Glasses? ¿Gun?
- All.

21:36.402 --> 21:37.836
Good luck.

23:32.247 --> 23:33.966
Who goes there?

23:40.093 --> 23:42.814
- Constable Bob Bratt.
- Pass.

23:44.016 --> 23:46.326
Quiet tonight.

24:10.495 --> 24:12.249
Hi there!

24:25.306 --> 24:27.025
Put that light out!

24:29.709 --> 24:32.384
- Is somebody calling?
- What you think you're doing showing a naked light?

24:32.592 --> 24:34.549
- I'm very sorry.
- Put it out!

24:34.713 --> 24:35.988
Yes.

24:42.839 --> 24:45.594
- Haven't you read the regulations?
- No.

24:46.322 --> 24:50.159
- All the worse. And you're a teacher!
- It's you, Mr. Bratt? I'm very sorry.

24:50.445 --> 24:52.198
Well, that's all right, Miss.

24:52.366 --> 24:56.203
I'm single handed and the fleet here, I have to keep an eye.

24:56.369 --> 25:00.888
A spy would give his head to get here,
but he won't get by Bob Bratt.

25:01.093 --> 25:03.085
- Good night.
- Good night.

26:26.235 --> 26:30.595
I do not know what spell makes me so sad.

26:30.999 --> 26:35.553
An ancient legend duped me and not let me.

26:52.575 --> 26:55.044
- What was the patrol doing?
- They saw the light.

26:56.497 --> 26:58.729
- You're alone?
- Of course.

27:00.701 --> 27:03.216
- Where this door leads?
- To the kitchen.

27:17.953 --> 27:19.911
- Does the ladder?
- A room.

27:34.525 --> 27:36.722
Butter!

27:36.967 --> 27:38.687
You gave me a fright.

27:45.454 --> 27:46.808
So you are Fraulein Thiel.

27:47.055 --> 27:48.489
Yes, captain Hardt.

27:51.258 --> 27:55.049
- From now on please speak in English.
- And eat in English?

27:55.461 --> 27:57.373
- Come in.
- Thank you.

28:03.187 --> 28:06.738
- How did you get here?
- A demure look and a fake passport.

28:07.230 --> 28:09.791
You speak English like a native.

28:09.952 --> 28:12.946
I shouldn't go very far. I am the teacher.

28:13.114 --> 28:15.835
- Teacher!
- My name is Anne Burnett.

28:15.996 --> 28:18.671
- Please call me that.
- Anne Burnett.

28:22.401 --> 28:24.597
Are you mad? Wearing an uniform here?

28:24.883 --> 28:28.764
If I'm shot, it will be as an officer, not a spy.

28:29.846 --> 28:32.408
Being a civilian I have no such defenses.

28:35.610 --> 28:37.807
I beg your pardon.

28:38.853 --> 28:43.452
A whole ham, white bread... and butter.

28:43.656 --> 28:45.888
- Butter!
- Butter.

28:46.298 --> 28:48.768
These English are not feeling the pinch.

29:06.073 --> 29:09.192
I had no idea secret agent's was such a comfortable profession.

29:09.876 --> 29:12.438
It has its uncomfortable moments.

29:12.638 --> 29:16.155
Talking about it, school opens the day after tomorrow.

29:17.281 --> 29:20.355
- I wonder how I should get on.
- So do I.

29:24.326 --> 29:27.799
In Germany girls no longer wear silk stockings.

29:29.370 --> 29:33.286
I'll show you your room. It's upstairs.

29:33.453 --> 29:36.926
- I haven't yet been told what I'm to do here.
- You'll be told tomorrow.

29:39.618 --> 29:41.291
Not tomorrow. Now!

29:43.540 --> 29:45.851
What are your orders?

29:48.584 --> 29:52.023
- I beg your pardon?
- Your orders, Captain Hardt!

29:52.627 --> 29:56.179
To report for duty to Fraulein Thiel and obey her orders.

29:56.350 --> 30:00.107
Exactly! Pick up your motorbike and go to bed.

30:05.677 --> 30:09.878
- Do I take it to bed with me?
- Suit yourself. There's a parking space at the wash den.

30:18.726 --> 30:20.126
Sorry.

30:28.453 --> 30:29.603
Good night.

30:35.058 --> 30:36.572
Hey, hey! Why are you locking me in?

30:38.221 --> 30:42.057
- A woman comes to clean in the morning.
- I can lock my own door.

30:42.224 --> 30:44.341
I think this is safer.

31:01.658 --> 31:03.537
- May I come in?
- Come in.

31:05.661 --> 31:07.654
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

31:07.823 --> 31:10.817
Your breakfast is in my room. 
There's a beautiful view from my window.

31:10.985 --> 31:15.220
I didn't come here for holidays. I have more 
important things to do than admire the view.

31:18.190 --> 31:19.749
All right!

32:08.067 --> 32:10.059
Well... ¿The plan?

32:11.109 --> 32:13.944
To sink 15 of these ships.

32:15.112 --> 32:16.546
How?

32:17.314 --> 32:19.192
He will tell you.

32:25.040 --> 32:26.793
Who is he?

32:27.001 --> 32:31.600
A British officer with a grudge. 
He was in command of a destroyer.

32:31.764 --> 32:34.326
- He lost it in a collision.
- How?

32:34.526 --> 32:36.803
A wrong order. He'd been drinking.

32:36.968 --> 32:41.010
Traitor and drunkard, an honor for the British navy.

32:41.892 --> 32:44.772
- Where did this happen?
- Off Cyprus.

32:45.615 --> 32:49.896
- HMS Connaught. February 16.
- Then you knew?

32:50.058 --> 32:54.293
- Of course. Commander Ashington.
- Lieutenant. He was dismissed of the ship.

32:55.542 --> 32:59.538
- Where did you meet him?
 - At Leith, a month ago.

32:59.825 --> 33:03.218
- And found he had a price.
- Rather a high one.

33:03.828 --> 33:06.822
- Paid by whom? 
- Germany.

33:07.431 --> 33:09.502
Only by Germany?

33:10.233 --> 33:11.826
And me.

33:13.435 --> 33:16.748
I suppose we should have to meet.

33:16.918 --> 33:18.716
Come down in a minute.

33:21.881 --> 33:24.272
Captain Hardt.

33:26.805 --> 33:29.002
Suppose we'll sit down and get acquainted.

33:31.729 --> 33:35.087
- Give him a drink; loosen him up a bit.
- I'd rather get to business.

33:35.331 --> 33:37.449
Drink when you can in this job. That's my motto.

33:38.974 --> 33:41.888
May we confine on what rests before us.

33:44.978 --> 33:47.448
All alike, you Germans, one tech mind.

33:47.620 --> 33:52.254
Draw the curtains, get the charts. Let's go.

33:52.984 --> 33:56.616
Here we are. Three years we've been sitting on our bottoms in Keith.

33:56.787 --> 33:59.428
- Met in Jutland.
- That's why you haven't put it out a notice since.

33:59.589 --> 34:01.946
- You mean ... 
- All right, we both won.

34:02.111 --> 34:04.627
Point is: with the fleet around the corner,

34:04.793 --> 34:07.867
and that the large fleet in Scapa watching,

34:08.034 --> 34:12.873
- You couldn't get to the Irish Channel...
- I know that. What's your plan?

34:15.561 --> 34:19.795
Two cruisers squadrons will sweep southward.

34:19.964 --> 34:22.434
I know that too. It is routine.

34:23.647 --> 34:28.087
But wouldn't you give an eye to know when, where & how?

34:28.250 --> 34:32.007
- Do you know?
- Everything except the actual time, and I'll get it.

34:32.172 --> 34:33.971
- Which squads? 
- The 1st and 5th.

34:34.135 --> 34:35.853
And the course?

34:38.938 --> 34:42.056
Here it is, pencil line. East of Swona.

34:42.981 --> 34:45.213
If we got submarines to rendez-vous...

34:45.382 --> 34:49.014
- In Sandwick Bay.
- In Sandwick Bay,

34:50.587 --> 34:52.704
- We could bag the lot,
- Exactly.

34:54.029 --> 34:57.627
They may alter the course, but I'll find out.

34:57.792 --> 35:00.706
- From whom?
- My brother. He is flag captain.

35:00.954 --> 35:04.632
- He too...? 
- No. It's a case of brotherly trust.

35:07.639 --> 35:10.235
When will this movement take place?

35:10.962 --> 35:14.354
Tomorrow. Next day. Anytime. 
But you'll get plenty of notice.

35:14.524 --> 35:17.997
We can't take submarines off blockade duty on suppositions.

35:18.167 --> 35:21.127
Supposition nothing! Those squadrons are going to sail.

35:21.409 --> 35:23.083
- The date? 
- I'll get it.

35:24.732 --> 35:26.849
It would be the biggest smash of the war.

35:27.654 --> 35:30.693
Then, we understand each other?

35:31.457 --> 35:33.449
I hope so.

35:35.740 --> 35:39.018
- To our next meeting.
- To our next meeting.

35:45.027 --> 35:46.780
Mind you, behave yourself.

35:48.629 --> 35:52.147
- Mr Ashington, what is your ship?
- The old Warspite.

35:52.472 --> 35:54.430
She won't be going out with the squad?

35:55.474 --> 35:58.435
- She's laid out for repairs, as usual.
- Pity.

36:02.399 --> 36:05.917
You see, children. When look at this
little island of ours, you realize it is...

36:06.082 --> 36:10.921
... the protector of much larger countries and continents.

36:11.526 --> 36:14.406
I know you don't like it but this isn't for a German audience.

36:14.689 --> 36:18.240
- You've almost persuade me to become British.
- What would I say next?

36:18.611 --> 36:21.765
There's the bit about the empire where the sun never sets.

36:24.816 --> 36:26.375
But it needs explain.

36:27.338 --> 36:30.616
Which way it goes? West-East or East-West?

36:31.341 --> 36:33.777
It worries me. I bet children will know.

36:36.705 --> 36:41.224
I shouldn't worry. You can teach them more important things.

36:41.628 --> 36:44.862
How to get to an island guarded like Gibraltar.

36:45.511 --> 36:50.464
How to twist British and German
officers round your little finger.

36:51.636 --> 36:55.028
Lots of things never taught in school.

36:55.278 --> 36:57.919
Doesn't all that belong to evening school for grown-ups?

36:58.921 --> 37:02.280
It is evening, and I am a grown-up.

37:02.564 --> 37:04.362
But you're not one of my pupils.

37:10.209 --> 37:13.124
Tell me: what became of the real Miss Burnett?

37:13.772 --> 37:17.654
- You know "Red Riding Hood"?
- It had a happy ending...

37:18.135 --> 37:20.446
That's why this story is different.

37:27.022 --> 37:30.096
- She met with an accident?
- Yes, an accident.

37:30.264 --> 37:34.385
- Were you present?
- I obey orders in my service.

37:35.108 --> 37:36.747
What a service!

37:37.389 --> 37:39.621
Have you ever fire a torpedo on an unarmed ship?

37:39.791 --> 37:42.671
- That's different!
- It's certainly more of the same.

37:53.841 --> 37:57.632
Why do you look down on me?
I obey orders, as you obey yours.

37:57.804 --> 38:00.036
We don't choose the jobs we do.

38:00.606 --> 38:04.568
We are parts of a machine of destruction. Like it or not.

38:09.333 --> 38:10.972
Where is the key?

38:11.775 --> 38:13.494
Here.

38:15.938 --> 38:17.930
Good night.

39:32.794 --> 39:35.071
Thank you, children. That's very nice.
Now you may dismiss.

39:46.164 --> 39:48.919
- Thank you very much. Good day.
- Good day.

40:15.986 --> 40:19.345
- Any news? 
- I got it. They sail tomorrow.

40:19.509 --> 40:20.863
- What time? 
- 7:00 a.m.

40:21.030 --> 40:22.703
- No changes?
- No changes.

40:22.871 --> 40:25.671
- You get in touch with your ship tonight.
- Be ready to leave at ten o'clock.

40:25.833 --> 40:28.030
- Tonight?
- Of course. Good work.

40:28.195 --> 40:32.032
- What is all this?
- Fraulein Thiel leaves with me.

40:38.723 --> 40:42.195
- This is the Reverend Hector Mathews.
- Is it? I mean, how'd you do?

40:42.366 --> 40:46.281
I'm sorry I can't shake hands. My name's
John Harris. I'm looking for the school.

40:46.449 --> 40:48.964
- To what purpose, may I ask?
- See my fiancee, Ms. Burnett.

40:49.131 --> 40:52.045
Ms Burnett didn't tell me she had any
connection with an English character.

40:52.213 --> 40:54.409
No; but she soon will have.

40:54.815 --> 40:58.173
If you are going to stay on the island
you may have a room at my house.

40:58.337 --> 41:02.049
- Far cheaper than lodging at the post office.
- Would it? I mean, that's very kind.

41:02.220 --> 41:05.454
- May bring your fiancee to dinner tonight.
- Well...

41:05.623 --> 41:09.334
If you give me your meat coupons, we will make a roast.

41:09.505 --> 41:13.057
- They're in my inside pocket and I rather...
- Allow me.

41:16.431 --> 41:18.184
At 7:30 sharp.

41:20.874 --> 41:23.629
- You wanted her to remain... 
-  Who cares what I want? Don't you see...

41:23.796 --> 41:26.631
- I only see one thing: my orders.
- Where are they?

41:27.038 --> 41:28.632
- Here.
- What do you mean here?

41:28.800 --> 41:30.678
What were the actual orders?

41:30.841 --> 41:33.311
On completion of the mission you'll be taken on board.

41:33.523 --> 41:35.675
- On completion?
- Yes, on completion.

41:35.845 --> 41:38.122
And, is it completed?

41:38.607 --> 41:43.081
Until your submarines come up with
our squadrons the job hasn't even began.

41:50.296 --> 41:52.765
- I think he's right.
- No other way of looking at it.

41:55.940 --> 41:59.822
I shall leave with a message. And tell Schuster
to depart tomorrow night for both of us.

42:00.463 --> 42:02.820
Now you're talking sense.

42:03.385 --> 42:05.264
- Who's that?
- Turn off the light.

42:10.270 --> 42:13.788
I'm awfully sorry. There must be another room.

42:14.393 --> 42:15.429
Come on in.

42:15.634 --> 42:18.389
Thank you. Not expect to see officers staying here.

42:18.917 --> 42:21.386
- It is difficult to find accomodation.
- Right.

42:21.719 --> 42:23.995
- We were just gonna have tea.
- Join us.

42:24.160 --> 42:27.553
Oh no really; I came to find my fiancee, Miss Burnett.

42:27.723 --> 42:29.316
- Is she here?
- Milk and sugar?

42:29.484 --> 42:31.477
- Very kind.
- Let me take it.

42:31.646 --> 42:34.003
More than kind of you. It's rather heavy.

42:36.329 --> 42:38.083
- How'd you do?
- Sit down.

42:38.411 --> 42:39.561
Thank you.

42:40.773 --> 42:44.131
Wasn't strange of me not letting
her know that I'd arrive?

42:44.295 --> 42:46.606
- Your tea.
- Thank you.

42:50.500 --> 42:52.332
Well, I should give her a shout.

42:52.501 --> 42:56.179
I'm averse to shouting. All of us here.

42:58.426 --> 42:59.940
Well, in that case...

43:01.148 --> 43:05.110
She'll be surprised to find me here, won't she?

43:05.271 --> 43:07.467
- Cake?
- No, thank you.

43:08.993 --> 43:13.434
I brought this gramophone, and heaps of new records.

43:16.479 --> 43:19.120
Have you heard "The Soldier's March"?

43:20.522 --> 43:24.040
It's rather large, but it has a beautiful tune.

43:42.058 --> 43:45.257
I don't recognize that metal ribbon.

43:45.500 --> 43:49.621
- What is it?
- The Iron Cross, second class.

43:50.384 --> 43:54.062
Second class... Then you must be a prisoner of war.

43:54.827 --> 43:57.423
No. You are.

43:59.070 --> 44:00.265
Oh dear!

44:04.754 --> 44:06.348
Oh, they haven't arrived yet!

44:06.516 --> 44:10.307
During a war, lateness for a meal is not only incivility but criminal waste.

44:10.479 --> 44:12.995
- I'm scare the meat will burn. 
- I bring it nonetheless.

44:13.161 --> 44:15.357
I will not wait longer.

44:17.644 --> 44:20.638
I'm greatly disappointed on Rev. Harris.

44:21.487 --> 44:24.720
For what we are to receive may the
Lord make us truly thankful. Amen.

44:31.734 --> 44:35.093
- Don't bite these, are macaroni.
- I should have some expla...

44:45.464 --> 44:48.105
- Better wait here for them to come.
- Why?

44:48.266 --> 44:50.702
- 'Stay here!
- Hurry.

45:18.249 --> 45:21.926
- Who is it?
- Rev. Matthews and his wife.

45:35.301 --> 45:37.294
Excuse me.

45:39.424 --> 45:42.897
- Good evening my dear.
- You chose a high night to play calls.

45:43.067 --> 45:46.459
Obligations to society take precedence over nature.

45:46.629 --> 45:50.591
- That's rather a compliment.
- A compliment was not my intention. We waited an hour.

45:50.873 --> 45:52.944
- Outside?
- At table.

45:53.114 --> 45:54.514
- At table?
- Precisely.

45:54.675 --> 45:58.512
- He's upset about the meat.
- Our concern has nothing to do with material.

45:58.678 --> 46:03.198
If you and Rev. could not come, courtesy demands a message.

46:03.442 --> 46:06.959
- Then were you expecting us?
- You must have received our invitation.

46:07.125 --> 46:11.006
- I'm afraid not. I had no idea.
- I find hard to believe he failed to convey it.

46:11.168 --> 46:12.727
- I'm afraid he did.
- That's odd.

46:12.889 --> 46:16.406
If I were your fiance, to see you after so long,

46:16.571 --> 46:19.725
- ... I would forget everything else.
- Perhaps you would explain...

46:19.894 --> 46:22.933
- The minute he arrived, he had a nasty attack.
- Attack?

46:23.096 --> 46:25.692
Yes, sort of a suffocation. He wasn't able to say anything.

46:25.858 --> 46:28.215
Oh, he is ill? I'm greatly relieved.

46:28.861 --> 46:32.458
I put a room at his disposal. I
couldn't understand his not coming.

46:32.623 --> 46:35.014
He's gone to bed an hour ago.

46:35.185 --> 46:37.701
- It is the most sensible.
- An embarrassing situation.

46:37.907 --> 46:41.539
Ms. Matthews should stay tonight.

46:41.710 --> 46:44.704
- Shall I?
- There's no need for that.

46:44.872 --> 46:48.026
As a Minister, I say that your position ...

46:48.195 --> 46:50.836
- As a future wife? 
- People might talk.

46:50.997 --> 46:53.911
In wartime? Do not worry about me.

46:54.079 --> 46:58.200
My conscience calls me talk to Rvd. Harris.

46:58.602 --> 47:02.757
I will not disturb him to satisfy anybody's conscience.

47:02.926 --> 47:04.246
Good night.

47:05.728 --> 47:08.038
Then...  You choose to defy me?

47:08.330 --> 47:10.765
Not at all. But this is my house I please myself.

47:11.012 --> 47:14.484
We'll see what the Education Committee thinks of it.

47:14.654 --> 47:16.213
- Good night. 
- Good night.

47:16.376 --> 47:20.291
I understand, but he'll be fighting his conscience all night.

47:21.659 --> 47:23.697
- Good night. 
- Good night.

47:34.829 --> 47:38.461
Sandwick Bay? What a hole!

47:38.752 --> 47:40.584
- Should take 2 hs to rendez vous.
- I hope so.

47:41.874 --> 47:45.074
We are 15 submarines. Our orders
are not to waste a single torpedo.

47:45.237 --> 47:47.878
- Good.
- We could sink a few.

47:48.039 --> 47:50.235
Tomorrow at same time come and pick us up.

47:50.401 --> 47:53.395
Yes, sir. Bad luck missing a fight like this

47:53.563 --> 47:56.318
- for a woman.
- Mind your own business.

48:06.532 --> 48:08.650
- Good luck!
- Thank you, sir.

48:14.899 --> 48:16.538
- Schuster!
- Sir?

48:16.700 --> 48:18.134
I nearly forgot.

48:19.622 --> 48:21.579
- What is it?
- Butter.

48:37.956 --> 48:41.268
- Sorry...
- Come on.

49:05.896 --> 49:07.968
- What happened? Did the message go? 
- On its way.

49:08.138 --> 49:10.529
Never been so cold. Must be out of shape.

49:10.700 --> 49:13.090
Damn fellow left me sitting in the hail.

49:13.262 --> 49:16.222
Is not our costume to entertain enemy officers

49:16.384 --> 49:18.615
however useful they may have been.

49:18.786 --> 49:22.542
- How does it feel to make history?
- I'll make some coffee to keep us warm.

49:22.869 --> 49:26.750
Don't you keep him up; it's been a 
strenous evening, time he went to bed.

49:28.513 --> 49:32.475
Still you have some way to go,
suppose you set us an example?

49:32.916 --> 49:35.716
Come on, have a bit of tact: can't
you see we want to be together?

49:35.878 --> 49:40.033
It's only two hours to dawn. Somebody
may wonder what has become of you.

49:40.722 --> 49:43.318
- I think I'll have another drink.
- Yes, do.

49:45.565 --> 49:49.083
After all you'll have the whole
day tomorrow to bid you adieu.

49:53.451 --> 49:54.931
Good night.

49:56.894 --> 50:01.175
- Persuasive fellow, aren't you?
- Sleep well.

50:08.582 --> 50:10.415
That's better.

50:10.584 --> 50:13.384
- You didn't give him much choice.
- Oh, he's quite happy.

50:13.546 --> 50:16.620
He has his whiskey and he is swinging down
the lane, convinced you're in love with him.

50:16.828 --> 50:18.741
In a minute I'll be swinging up to bed.

50:18.910 --> 50:21.426
No, no. I want to talk to you. And want that coffee.

50:21.912 --> 50:24.269
It's 4:00. Let's talk tomorrow.

50:24.474 --> 50:27.752
Tomorrow? Can't you see this chance will never come again?

50:27.916 --> 50:29.636
Our job is done.

50:29.798 --> 50:33.760
In one hour the submarines will be
meeting and in two they should strike.

50:34.041 --> 50:36.762
And in a week, you and I will be in Kiel,

50:37.203 --> 50:39.161
How we'll celebrate!

50:39.325 --> 50:42.923
Then on to Berlin. I can see us lunching at the Hotel Adlon.

50:43.488 --> 50:47.609
You'll have the Iron Cross in your bag
and you'll be the only girl in Berlin...

50:48.692 --> 50:50.604
in silk stockings.

50:53.135 --> 50:54.728
Silk stockings I might take to bed.

50:56.137 --> 50:59.894
I have served under many commanders
but none I admired more than you.

51:00.140 --> 51:03.340
- What will you do when you're home again?
- You just told me.

51:03.503 --> 51:06.975
- Trip to Berlin, the Adlon Hotel. 
- And after Berlin?

51:07.466 --> 51:10.141
Another job. Another island. Another Ashington.

51:10.308 --> 51:12.618
And another captain Hardt?

51:12.910 --> 51:14.947
Perhaps. Please let me go.

51:17.153 --> 51:21.069
Commander Thiel, don't forget that you won a victory.

51:21.516 --> 51:24.715
A good commander must celebrate with his men.

51:24.878 --> 51:27.713
If I'm in command, I order you to let me go.

53:48.224 --> 53:50.820
David.

53:55.029 --> 53:56.668
Jill.

54:01.113 --> 54:04.153
- These have been the worst 10 minutes I ever spent.
- Me too.

54:04.436 --> 54:07.874
- It's all over now.
- Yes, darling.

54:13.202 --> 54:16.037
Little fool, what you mean coming out here without a coat?

54:16.605 --> 54:18.562
Running risks like that?

54:19.007 --> 54:21.647
- Where is he?
- Upstairs, locked in his room.

54:21.809 --> 54:23.880
You are a marvel.

54:25.291 --> 54:27.010
Sir!

54:31.376 --> 54:32.810
Special Constable Bob Pratt, sir.

54:32.977 --> 54:35.128
- Know who I am?
- You're Commander Blacklock, sir.

54:35.200 --> 54:38.334
When the patrol arrives tell them
to stand by. Nobody goes in or out.

54:38.341 --> 54:42.132
- Where is your armlet?
- When I heard German spies are about 

54:42.134 --> 54:44.784
I put it in my pocket, to be close and not recognized.

54:44.786 --> 54:47.586
- Keep your eyes skinned.
- Aye, Aye, sir.

54:55.000 --> 54:58.494
David, you won't have him arrested
until I leave the house, will you?

54:58.500 --> 55:02.263
Give us credit for a little imagination.
Besides, he's safe enough in here.

55:02.278 --> 55:04.874
Couldn't you let him go back to his ship
and at least give him a fighting chance?

55:05.040 --> 55:09.002
Too risky. He might find someone who
knew the real Thiel and Ashington.

55:10.845 --> 55:12.723
- You hear that?
- What is it?

55:12.886 --> 55:14.559
The destroyer's flotilla.

55:14.728 --> 55:18.689
They've been loading extra depth charges all
night. The result of our midnight labours.

55:20.372 --> 55:23.411
In a few hours, there won't be
any U-boats in Sandwick Bay,

55:24.495 --> 55:28.046
just a few spots of grease,
drifting out to the North Sea.

55:38.065 --> 55:40.820
- I think I'm rather sick.
- Here.

55:41.707 --> 55:43.381
Give it a pull a bit.

55:49.033 --> 55:50.786
Woman: you're going into history!

55:55.117 --> 55:56.950
I know.

55:57.879 --> 56:02.160
Buzz upstairs and get your things.
I'm taking you straight to the St. Magnus,

56:02.323 --> 56:04.315
she sails in an hour.

56:05.245 --> 56:09.526
I haven't got anything of my own.
Everything is Anne Burnett's.

56:09.808 --> 56:11.766
Then, here we go.

56:24.419 --> 56:27.254
- I'll be back in half an hour to get him. Stand by.
- Aye, aye, sir.

56:27.541 --> 56:30.103
Sir; you wouldn't like us to save you the trouble?

56:30.263 --> 56:33.257
No. I have personal reasons
for doing this job myself.

56:38.770 --> 56:40.329
You'll look after her?

56:40.491 --> 56:43.963
I'll be on the bridge. So my
cabin is for the lady to use.

56:44.134 --> 56:46.524
- Very kind of yours. 
- It's a wee bit little, but it's warm,

56:46.695 --> 56:50.054
- and you can have it all for yourself.
- Thank you.

56:55.302 --> 56:57.055
Well ...

57:03.100 --> 57:04.523
Walter, hear, Walter. I warn you:

57:04.529 --> 57:08.999
Unless I got a day in port to work
on the bottom, it won't last one week.

57:09.012 --> 57:12.331
- We'll see about it, James.
- I hope so.

57:12.394 --> 57:13.748
Excuse me.

57:16.237 --> 57:18.469
The Pastor! I left him tied up in school.

57:18.639 --> 57:21.872
- Poor Mr Harris.
- To the rescue! Good bye.

57:22.802 --> 57:26.957
- You will take care, won't you?
- Indeed.

57:30.568 --> 57:34.040
- All present and correct.
- Thanks.

57:35.171 --> 57:36.890
- Two around the back.
- You two,

57:36.899 --> 57:40.870
... keep an eye on the window, but keep
out of sight. I don't want any casualties.

57:40.895 --> 57:44.095
Two on the road. The rest, you got the front of the house.

57:47.860 --> 57:50.581
Keep close to the wall. The rest follow me.

57:50.743 --> 57:52.063
- You think he's gonna shoot us?
- Would you?

57:52.624 --> 57:55.698
You'll find a pastor in school. 
Cut him loose and calm him till I come.

57:56.307 --> 57:58.982
He'll be rather annoyed. Stay here.

58:15.881 --> 58:18.272
Captain Hardt, this is Commander
Blacklock, of the Royal Navy.

58:23.647 --> 58:27.484
If you throw your gun out the window
and surrender, you'll be treated as a POW.

58:27.650 --> 58:29.004
Otherwise, you'll be shot.

58:29.491 --> 58:31.643
- Nobody at school, sir.
- What?

58:43.021 --> 58:44.091
Untie the poor devil!

58:52.028 --> 58:53.508
Cast off!

58:55.951 --> 58:59.070
- Hold on. A passenger's coming.
- Aye, sir.

59:03.116 --> 59:06.235
Mr. Harris, commander Blacklock asked
for you. I'll tell him that you caught the boat.

59:15.125 --> 59:18.085
I asked myself: if all is as it should be,

59:18.607 --> 59:21.123
Why I am prevented from seeing Rev. Harris?

59:21.289 --> 59:25.969
I can tell you: Harris was tied in school
because he was a nuisance.

59:26.573 --> 59:28.770
You were lucky not to suffer the same fate.

59:28.935 --> 59:33.375
- Under Blacklock you would have.
- I cannot pretend to understand.

59:33.538 --> 59:37.534
I'll help you. And attempt was made
by German spies to kill Anne Burnett

59:37.701 --> 59:40.501
and put an agent in her place.
Fortunately, it failed.

59:41.544 --> 59:45.335
They drop her off a cliff, but by a 100
to 1 chance a patrol boat fished her out.

59:46.148 --> 59:49.779
She said enough so we grabbed the spy in Thurso.

59:50.551 --> 59:53.306
Then we had the idea of replacing
her with a counter-spy.

59:54.233 --> 59:57.831
In short notice we found a brave volunteer,

59:58.276 --> 01:00:00.712
the girl you know as Anne Burnett.

01:00:00.878 --> 01:00:05.113
The Anne Burnett at school is not the teacher,

01:00:05.362 --> 01:00:08.595
Nor the Anne Burnett the Germans intended.

01:00:08.764 --> 01:00:11.838
- She's not Miss Burnett at all.
- Substantially correct.

01:00:12.087 --> 01:00:16.606
- Then who is she?
- That's an official secret.

01:00:22.254 --> 01:00:25.054
- What's the matter, Blacklock?
- Hardt, sir, he got away.

01:00:25.216 --> 01:00:27.857
- The German?
- Locked Harris, and he wears his clothes.

01:00:28.018 --> 01:00:29.168
Excuse me, sir.

01:00:29.620 --> 01:00:32.534
Signals? Send a call to all patrols in the island.

01:00:33.903 --> 01:00:35.815
He won't get away, sir. He can't do any harm.

01:01:05.486 --> 01:01:06.886
All aboard for mainland!

01:01:17.375 --> 01:01:18.375
Stop!

01:01:18.536 --> 01:01:20.607
All, in single file.

01:01:21.017 --> 01:01:23.135
One by one. Look.

01:01:35.628 --> 01:01:37.062
Put them aboard there.

01:01:38.150 --> 01:01:39.948
Here we are, sir. All present.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:43.527
- Eight German prisoners.
- Look starved to me.

01:01:43.554 --> 01:01:45.068
Are they off a U-boat?

01:01:45.235 --> 01:01:48.469
It blew. On one of their own mines.

01:01:48.638 --> 01:01:50.197
One of their...?

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:55.473
- You think they'll see the joke?
- Guess not.

01:01:59.726 --> 01:02:02.037
Here, by the right!

01:02:02.928 --> 01:02:04.282
You're the right man!

01:02:04.449 --> 01:02:06.123
I do not understand.

01:02:06.291 --> 01:02:09.444
It's like talking to stuffed dummies.

01:02:09.613 --> 01:02:13.655
Well, stand easy; you're depressing.

01:02:15.217 --> 01:02:19.213
- What do I do with them?
- Split them up. Forr'ard and aft.

01:02:19.781 --> 01:02:21.579
Steward!

01:02:23.904 --> 01:02:26.784
- Aye, aye, sir. 
- Give them some coffee.

01:02:27.827 --> 01:02:28.896
Poor devils.

01:02:34.872 --> 01:02:37.228
- Walter!
- Well, James?

01:02:37.394 --> 01:02:40.945
I am not superstitious, but I do not like this.

01:02:41.116 --> 01:02:43.074
Mind the engines and I'll mind the ship.

01:02:43.238 --> 01:02:46.232
No mind my mentioning.

01:02:46.400 --> 01:02:49.600
Six weeks I've been trying to fix
a new lining to the bottom of this.

01:02:50.243 --> 01:02:54.922
I do not like those Germans. Bad luck.

01:02:55.407 --> 01:02:58.048
They could go in the St. Ninian with the other prisoners.

01:02:58.209 --> 01:03:01.203
They were crowded. They will not give us problems.

01:03:01.972 --> 01:03:04.727
4 in the forecastle and 4 in the saloon,

01:03:04.894 --> 01:03:09.334
a sentry for four. No one can reach them.

01:03:09.697 --> 01:03:13.613
Well... Maybe.

01:03:39.199 --> 01:03:40.679
Too young.

01:03:48.486 --> 01:03:51.321
- Father, they only speak German.
- Shut up or die.

01:03:52.129 --> 01:03:55.282
Captain Hardt. Taking command of the ship.

01:03:55.451 --> 01:03:57.808
Take care of the crew. Come on!

01:04:15.986 --> 01:04:17.865
Your replacement, he's overdue.

01:04:25.993 --> 01:04:29.227
No sausages. It's what you eat, right?

01:04:34.280 --> 01:04:37.319
- The Germans!
- Stop!

01:04:53.534 --> 01:04:55.730
Below there!

01:04:56.776 --> 01:04:58.734
Doddie!

01:05:07.424 --> 01:05:08.699
Doddie!

01:05:09.065 --> 01:05:10.738
Give me the rocket launcher.

01:05:13.709 --> 01:05:17.101
- Get off my bridge whoever you are!
- Drop that pistol.

01:05:17.431 --> 01:05:21.427
- You're my prisoner.
- Get out of here or I'll shoot!

01:05:21.594 --> 01:05:23.473
Do not move.

01:05:23.996 --> 01:05:26.796
- Your ship is in my hands.
- And who might you be?

01:05:26.958 --> 01:05:29.428
- I'm a German officer.
- On those clothes?

01:05:29.600 --> 01:05:32.560
They do for the present. Where is your wireless kept?

01:05:32.723 --> 01:05:35.603
- There is none.
- No wireless?

01:05:35.925 --> 01:05:38.441
No German went out of the house
while I was at duty, Admiral.

01:05:38.647 --> 01:05:40.958
I handed over to the patrol; there
were nine of them and one of me.

01:05:41.129 --> 01:05:44.168
You didn't suspect that passenger on the pier?
Where were your eyes, man?

01:05:44.331 --> 01:05:48.088
He jumped aboard when she was casting off.
I did deliver your message, commander.

01:05:48.254 --> 01:05:50.929
- Yes, you told us that before.
- That will do, Bob.

01:05:51.096 --> 01:05:55.297
- You got to give credit to Hardt ...
- I give to him for causing this infernal cheek!

01:05:55.459 --> 01:05:57.133
He can't get away, sir.

01:05:57.981 --> 01:06:00.292
Signals: Wire Scrabster and Thurso.

01:06:00.463 --> 01:06:03.377
"Arrest German officer masquerading as a passenger. Stop".

01:06:03.545 --> 01:06:05.697
To all the patrols.

01:06:05.867 --> 01:06:09.145
"Order St. Magnus to heave to and
await destroyer." Repeat that back.

01:06:14.393 --> 01:06:17.353
Go below! Go!
Attention.

01:06:20.718 --> 01:06:22.870
- I need two men. 
- Very well.

01:06:23.040 --> 01:06:24.997
Keep an eye on the crew and passengers.

01:06:25.161 --> 01:06:28.474
To monitor crew and passengers! Come with me.

01:06:31.246 --> 01:06:34.240
Stay calm. Let's take a look.

01:06:38.691 --> 01:06:39.920
Out.

01:06:43.094 --> 01:06:45.815
- How did you escape?
- That I must thank you for.

01:06:45.977 --> 01:06:49.210
Sentiment made you stop being Fraulein Thiel 

01:06:49.379 --> 01:06:52.020
- Or Miss Burnett...
- Mrs. Blacklock!

01:06:53.062 --> 01:06:56.853
That's one secret you kept well. How considerate.

01:06:57.145 --> 01:06:58.579
Now you captured the ship what will you do?

01:06:58.786 --> 01:07:01.302
Lay a course for the submarines at Sandwick.

01:07:01.468 --> 01:07:03.745
- You can't do that!
- I'm not under your orders!

01:07:03.810 --> 01:07:06.999
- But it is full of mines!
- We shall both take our chance.

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:11.214
- This doesn't mean you and me.
- Right: It means the life of hundreds of my comrades!

01:07:11.215 --> 01:07:15.199
- But the children and women here aren't people?
- That will be at your door, not mine.

01:07:15.238 --> 01:07:17.999
The war broke. You forget, as I did before.

01:07:18.040 --> 01:07:20.681
- You are English, I'm German. We are enemies!
- I like that better.

01:07:20.882 --> 01:07:23.444
And I. It simplifies everything!

01:07:24.205 --> 01:07:25.685
Come on.

01:07:32.731 --> 01:07:35.088
- Lay a course, East.
- East, captain.

01:07:42.938 --> 01:07:43.938
Now what, sir?

01:07:57.189 --> 01:08:00.308
Listen. You're held as prisoners of war.

01:08:00.832 --> 01:08:03.142
I do not want any noise and panic.

01:08:04.034 --> 01:08:06.504
Whoever disobeys orders will be shot.

01:08:07.316 --> 01:08:08.990
With one exception.

01:08:17.764 --> 01:08:19.562
- Be quiet!
- Easy.

01:08:19.805 --> 01:08:24.404
A19, A24, A7... St. Magnus spotted
by 3 patrols. Still on the right course.

01:08:24.609 --> 01:08:27.205
There are eight German prisoners on that ship.

01:08:28.572 --> 01:08:31.532
- What are you doing, you can go home.
- Thank you.

01:08:32.295 --> 01:08:35.926
If they join forces with a desperate man like Hardt...

01:08:36.298 --> 01:08:40.499
- Message from A17.
- No sighting. She's overdue.

01:08:42.301 --> 01:08:45.102
She set a different course between A7 and A17.

01:08:47.546 --> 01:08:49.582
Sandwick Bay.

01:08:50.988 --> 01:08:53.299
My wife is on that ship.

01:08:53.630 --> 01:08:54.825
- Orderly.
- Yes, sir.

01:08:54.991 --> 01:08:57.712
I want to see the commander of the flotilla.

01:09:01.595 --> 01:09:05.113
I'm sorry. You'll have to forget personal affairs.

01:09:06.279 --> 01:09:07.712
Sir?

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:13.216
We believe St. Magnus was captured by German
prisoners who are making a rush for Sandwick.

01:09:13.243 --> 01:09:15.919
Cmdr Blacklock will advise you on the course to be taken.

01:09:16.207 --> 01:09:18.962
Go out to Switha Sound and cut her off.

01:09:19.408 --> 01:09:22.243
- She's to be sunk?
- If they won't surrender...

01:09:34.859 --> 01:09:36.260
Skipper!

01:09:37.903 --> 01:09:39.656
Skipper!

01:09:45.508 --> 01:09:47.227
- Are you there, Walter? 
- Huh?

01:09:48.911 --> 01:09:52.428
We can't keep at this speed much longer.

01:09:53.274 --> 01:09:55.870
It's murdering my bearings.

01:09:56.837 --> 01:10:00.468
Fearful pressure on engines. 
I don't know how the ship'll put up with.

01:10:00.960 --> 01:10:03.760
- Where are we going?
- Due east.

01:10:04.722 --> 01:10:07.397
Soon we will leave the patrolled area.

01:10:07.564 --> 01:10:10.205
- We're in the hands of the providence.
- No we are not; we are in the hands

01:10:10.366 --> 01:10:12.882
of a man who cares nothing for his life or yours.

01:10:13.048 --> 01:10:16.680
It's all my fault, cause I forgot that we were at war,

01:10:16.851 --> 01:10:20.210
that the war kills any decent human feeling.

01:10:37.707 --> 01:10:40.382
- Can you shake it up a bit?
- No, it's flat out now.

01:10:59.002 --> 01:11:02.964
The old man is deaf or dumb. 
Or is a U-boat he's after.

01:11:10.731 --> 01:11:12.131
Out.

01:11:13.573 --> 01:11:15.007
Out!

01:11:21.179 --> 01:11:23.330
Funny; there's no sign of the old tub yet.

01:11:23.500 --> 01:11:25.811
- Perhaps they altered course again.
- Not likely.

01:11:40.673 --> 01:11:44.908
Have a look, Felix. 
Is not the St. Magnus?

01:11:48.118 --> 01:11:51.431
It's her all right. What's she doing so off course?

01:11:51.921 --> 01:11:53.675
- Looks suspicious.
- What a cinch!

01:11:54.123 --> 01:11:56.719
We gotta save all the torpedoes!

01:11:57.726 --> 01:12:00.606
Nothing in the orders to stop
us sending a couple of shells...

01:12:02.689 --> 01:12:04.442
Stand by to surface!

01:12:04.931 --> 01:12:07.367
Guns trough, action stations.
Objective: steamship. Steer right.

01:12:28.228 --> 01:12:30.060
Remove the British flag.

01:12:45.401 --> 01:12:46.470
The U29!

01:12:49.404 --> 01:12:52.318
Schuster! Schuster!

01:12:55.208 --> 01:12:58.965
Do not shoot! Do not shoot!

01:13:01.412 --> 01:13:04.851
It's me, Hardt!

01:13:17.544 --> 01:13:19.662
There's someone semaphoring from the bridge!

01:13:19.986 --> 01:13:21.818
H - A - R

01:13:38.960 --> 01:13:41.157
There's firing down the haven.

01:13:42.443 --> 01:13:45.482
Better take a look. Hold the course, Number One.

01:13:57.534 --> 01:14:00.653
Wear the lifevests. Get to the lifeboats.

01:14:01.136 --> 01:14:03.732
Stay calm.

01:14:05.379 --> 01:14:07.258
To the lifeboat!

01:14:22.472 --> 01:14:25.511
Keep calm and put on the floats.

01:14:27.356 --> 01:14:31.192
Donald, stop what you're doing
and come up to the deck. Hurry up.

01:14:46.770 --> 01:14:48.329
There she is!

01:14:50.293 --> 01:14:51.612
Stand by. Guns out.

01:14:55.176 --> 01:14:59.411
- Don't fire!. She's sinking by the stern.
- They're taking to the boats, sir.

01:15:00.100 --> 01:15:01.614
Captain, look, destroyer!

01:15:04.663 --> 01:15:06.097
Crash dive!

01:15:06.344 --> 01:15:09.344
She's being shelled by a U-boat.
01:15:09,344 --> 01:15:12,101
We'll have a crack at it, Number One!

01:15:16.572 --> 01:15:17.767
Objective: submarine.

01:15:21.936 --> 01:15:23.768
Depth charge... ready!

01:16:23.821 --> 01:16:26.337
- You may leave.
- Not without you.

01:16:26.823 --> 01:16:29.737
That's an order!

01:16:31.106 --> 01:16:34.021
It's time to go, miss. Take it to the boat, James.

01:16:41.834 --> 01:16:43.667
It's my old ship that sank us.

01:16:51.441 --> 01:16:53.911
Come on now Missi, come on. Hurry.

01:16:57.646 --> 01:17:00.560
What are you doing here? 
You should get into a boat.

01:17:00.808 --> 01:17:03.688
If you don't mind, I'd rather stay.

01:17:03.891 --> 01:17:05.962
Suit yourself. It's your business.

01:17:07.854 --> 01:17:10.768
Captain, have you got a cigarette?

01:17:11.336 --> 01:17:13.568
Never smoke them, but got
a pipe if you want it.

01:17:13.738 --> 01:17:17.210
- Never smoke a pipe.
- A little late to learn.

01:17:53.327 --> 01:17:55.923
She's there. I can see her!
