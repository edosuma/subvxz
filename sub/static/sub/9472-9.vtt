00:08.257 --> 00:11.642
This week on "VICE":
The future of energy.

00:13.262 --> 00:14.678
Energy by far is
the biggest problem we face.

00:14.814 --> 00:16.730
<i>If human beings are going to sustain</i>

00:16.849 --> 00:18.515
<i>our civilization long
into the future,</i>

00:18.651 --> 00:20.484
<i>we have to cut our
addiction to fossil fuels.</i>

00:20.569 --> 00:22.686
It's a given.
Smith: How fast can this go?

00:22.822 --> 00:24.905
Well, pretty fast.

00:25.024 --> 00:28.025
<i>The end game is to have a
future where we can look ahead</i>

00:28.110 --> 00:30.027
and say this is gonna be good.

00:30.162 --> 00:32.445
Fusion is the perfect way
to make energy.

00:32.531 --> 00:35.249
<i>It is definitely the energy
source of the future.</i>

00:35.367 --> 00:40.871
You're gonna explain how you can build
a fusion reactor in your garage.

00:40.956 --> 00:43.173
Is this legal?

01:08.033 --> 01:11.368
For the past four seasons, we've
been reporting on the climate crisis

01:11.453 --> 01:14.121
that's threatening
to destroy our planet.

01:15.374 --> 01:18.709
This is about three feet
of water on my street,

01:18.794 --> 01:20.294
Desbrosses, in New York City.

01:20.412 --> 01:23.297
Lower Manhattan is completely
under water.

01:25.918 --> 01:29.052
Smith: There it goes! There it goes!
There it goes!

01:29.138 --> 01:30.671
Whoa!

01:30.756 --> 01:33.924
The scientists have now
started to realize

01:34.009 --> 01:36.009
that Antarctica is melting.

01:36.095 --> 01:38.011
This is a "holy shit" moment.

01:39.982 --> 01:41.732
Smith: It's worse
than "holy shit"?

01:45.104 --> 01:47.271
The bad news is that climate change

01:47.356 --> 01:49.323
and global warming continue unabated.

01:49.441 --> 01:52.075
<i>But the good news is
that humanity is finally</i>

01:52.161 --> 01:55.245
<i>waking up to this fact and
staring the problem in the face.</i>

01:55.331 --> 01:59.449
Our nations share a sense of
urgency about this challenge

01:59.585 --> 02:04.788
and a growing realization that it is
within our power to do something about it.

02:04.924 --> 02:06.340
Smith:
<i>At the end of last year,</i>

02:06.458 --> 02:08.508
<i>at the UN Climate Change
Conference in Paris,</i>

02:08.627 --> 02:11.762
<i>our world's leaders reached a landmark
agreement in the global effort</i>

02:11.847 --> 02:16.266
to move away from fossil fuels
and towards clean energy.

02:16.352 --> 02:19.353
The task before us now
is to find the solutions

02:19.471 --> 02:22.522
that will make those goals a reality.

02:54.640 --> 02:56.840
There's still one more.

03:11.357 --> 03:12.856
So what did we just do there?

03:12.941 --> 03:15.108
We released a heck
of a lot of energy.

03:15.194 --> 03:17.661
Again... again, remember,
power is energy over time.

03:17.746 --> 03:20.914
So we released all that energy in
an incredibly short time scale

03:21.033 --> 03:22.699
and that's what power is.

03:22.835 --> 03:25.502
Smith: Coffee creamer
turned into a bomb.

03:25.587 --> 03:27.838
How did that happen? Wilson: Yeah,
so the coffee creamer is sugar,

03:27.923 --> 03:30.257
sugar is a fuel, came from
plants, came from corn.

03:30.376 --> 03:32.042
Plants are sitting here
photosynthesizing,

03:32.127 --> 03:35.712
making sugars out
of the energy from the sun

03:35.798 --> 03:39.182
and we just released that
energy from the sun... Right.

03:39.268 --> 03:40.767
In the form of a fireball.

03:40.886 --> 03:43.887
That's the same reaction,
that same chemical reaction,

03:44.023 --> 03:45.939
that a coal power plant uses,

03:46.058 --> 03:48.025
a natural gas power plant uses,

03:48.110 --> 03:50.694
but it all originally came
from that sun over there.

03:50.779 --> 03:53.196
So coal, natural gas,

03:53.282 --> 03:56.783
homemade bombs, uh, uranium...

03:56.902 --> 03:58.902
Yes. It's all energy.
Everything?

04:00.622 --> 04:03.290
Smith: <i>In 2009, when he was just 14,</i>

04:03.409 --> 04:04.908
<i>Taylor stunned the world
when he built</i>

04:05.044 --> 04:08.078
<i>a nuclear reactor
in his garage and became</i>

04:08.163 --> 04:11.965
<i>the youngest person ever
to achieve nuclear fusion.</i>

04:12.084 --> 04:14.384
So this is your infamous garage. Yes.

04:14.470 --> 04:17.803
Smith: <i>I'm afraid, and I
have an unnatural fear</i>

04:17.923 --> 04:22.642
<i>of radioactivity,
so you're gonna allay my fears</i>

04:22.761 --> 04:25.262
<i>and you're gonna explain
how you can build</i>

04:25.397 --> 04:28.682
<i>a fusion reactor in your garage.</i>

04:32.271 --> 04:34.488
The stars use all their gravity,

04:34.606 --> 04:37.074
uh, to combine hydrogen atoms.

04:37.159 --> 04:39.576
I'm using very high voltage
electricity

04:39.661 --> 04:42.195
to do the same thing
inside this reactor.

04:42.281 --> 04:44.831
Have you ever blown out
the power grid?

04:44.950 --> 04:47.167
Oh, yeah.
So this lived... Well...

04:47.286 --> 04:50.704
So this lived at the University
of Nevada for a very long time,

04:50.789 --> 04:52.509
<i>and that's where I did
a lot of experiments.</i>

04:52.541 --> 04:54.581
So when you went to the
university, how old were you?

04:54.626 --> 04:56.042
Yeah. I was 14, yeah.

04:56.128 --> 04:58.962
So you're Doogie Howser of
the... of the radioactive age.

04:59.098 --> 05:01.765
Physics department.
So, how hot can this get?

05:01.850 --> 05:05.769
Um, I mean, we're talking
400 or 500 million degrees

05:05.854 --> 05:08.555
is the temperature of the ions that are
fusing. Like the sun or something?

05:08.640 --> 05:10.974
Yeah, hotter than the sun. So
this can go hotter than the sun?

05:11.059 --> 05:14.027
Wilson: The ions that are
fusing inside this, yes, yes.

05:14.146 --> 05:17.147
And is this legal?
Yeah, I think so.

05:17.282 --> 05:19.533
So you don't know.
Well, it is.

05:19.651 --> 05:23.286
Now, if I started to enrich uranium
or produce weapons-grade plutonium,

05:23.372 --> 05:25.122
then I think some people
would be concerned.

05:25.207 --> 05:28.158
So let's talk about enriching uranium
and weapons-grade plutonium.

05:28.293 --> 05:32.496
You have some things here, yellowcake or...
Yeah, you wanna take a look?

05:32.581 --> 05:35.832
Smith: <i>Yellowcake is a
type of enriched uranium.</i>

05:35.918 --> 05:39.886
<i>It's a precursor to the more
concentrated fuel used in reactors,</i>

05:40.005 --> 05:42.839
<i>and ultimately nuclear weapons.</i>

05:42.975 --> 05:45.642
So this is what
the president and Congress

05:45.727 --> 05:47.761
and Iran are all fighting about,

05:47.846 --> 05:51.148
is exactly what you have in your
garage out back? Yeah.

05:51.233 --> 05:53.066
Smith:
How did you get it?

05:53.185 --> 05:56.186
So, I make a lot of yellowcake,
from time to time.

05:56.321 --> 05:57.771
You make your own yellowcake? Yep.

05:57.856 --> 05:59.439
Just, you know, crush up some ore,

05:59.525 --> 06:00.991
chemically process it,
and that's the...

06:01.076 --> 06:04.945
So you go out into the desert,
you get raw uranium...

06:05.030 --> 06:06.696
Yeah, uranium ore.
and make your own yellowcake.

06:06.782 --> 06:11.084
Yeah. Can you take us to
where you get the uranium?

06:11.203 --> 06:13.119
Yeah. We'll go see
where the ore comes from.

06:13.205 --> 06:16.006
We're gonna start
our own arms program here.

06:20.879 --> 06:23.930
Wilson: This is a deposit
of thorium and rare earth.

06:24.049 --> 06:26.683
Smith: So this is a rare
earth mineral. Yeah.

06:26.768 --> 06:30.520
And up in the hills, there's mines
and old deposits of uranium.

06:30.606 --> 06:33.857
They originated in some
far off galactic cataclysm

06:33.942 --> 06:35.609
and they were deposited onto Earth.

06:35.727 --> 06:38.728
So uranium is energy from stars

06:38.864 --> 06:40.363
that have landed on the Earth?

06:40.449 --> 06:42.532
Yes. Yes.

06:48.240 --> 06:50.290
We're out here in the high desert.
Yeah.

06:50.409 --> 06:54.878
And right there, there's a power plant.
So let's talk about power.

06:54.963 --> 06:57.297
Let's talk about our
insatiable thirst for energy.

06:57.416 --> 07:00.417
Yeah, well, energy, by far, is
the biggest problem we face.

07:00.552 --> 07:02.912
I mean, whether it's, you know,
having clean water supplies,

07:02.971 --> 07:06.089
fresh water supplies,
abundant food supplies,

07:06.174 --> 07:08.642
geopolitical instability,
all these things come back

07:08.760 --> 07:11.428
to how we use energy,
how we get energy,

07:11.513 --> 07:13.647
whether we dig it up
from the ground or we use it,

07:13.765 --> 07:15.599
uh, you know,
from the heavens above us.

07:15.734 --> 07:17.767
And, uh, this is the way we typically

07:17.853 --> 07:21.104
produce electricity now,
in this case natural gas.

07:21.189 --> 07:23.406
We dig it out of the ground
or suck it out of the ground

07:23.492 --> 07:24.892
and burn it to produce electricity.

07:24.943 --> 07:28.445
And how much longer do we have
of burning things?

07:28.580 --> 07:29.779
Not very long.
Why?

07:29.865 --> 07:31.281
Our Earth can't take it
and we don't have

07:31.366 --> 07:32.699
very much of it left.
Right.

07:32.784 --> 07:34.501
If human beings are gonna sustain

07:34.620 --> 07:36.369
our civilization
long into the future,

07:36.455 --> 07:38.788
we have to cut our addiction
to fossil fuels.

07:38.924 --> 07:41.124
It's just... it's a given.
And how do we do that?

07:41.260 --> 07:44.294
Well, all this can be done
by using a combination

07:44.429 --> 07:46.046
of technologies like renewable,

07:46.131 --> 07:48.882
grid storage, and nuclear power.

07:50.636 --> 07:52.716
Smith: <i>Now, to better
understand the energy landscape</i>

07:52.771 --> 07:56.106
<i>as it stands today,
we met with Nobel Prize winner</i>

07:56.191 --> 07:59.726
<i>and former secretary of
energy, Professor Steven Chu.</i>

07:59.811 --> 08:02.696
The incumbent way we make electricity

08:02.814 --> 08:05.115
is still dominated by fossil fuel.

08:05.200 --> 08:07.367
<i>And it's transitioning from coal,</i>

08:07.486 --> 08:11.488
<i>which two decades ago was the
dominant source of electricity,</i>

08:11.573 --> 08:14.658
<i>to some mixture
of natural gas and coal.</i>

08:14.793 --> 08:18.295
<i>Coal is about twice
as bad as natural gas</i>

08:18.380 --> 08:21.498
<i>for carbon emissions
per unit of electricity.</i>

08:21.583 --> 08:25.585
<i>We're swimming in natural gas,
but you also have to remember</i>

08:25.671 --> 08:27.554
<i>that it is a transition fuel.</i>

08:27.673 --> 08:31.341
<i>We still have to wean ourselves
away from fossil fuel</i>

08:31.426 --> 08:33.677
<i>for climate change reasons.</i>

08:36.014 --> 08:37.847
The good news is,
in the United States,

08:37.933 --> 08:42.352
we happen to be blessed with
amazing renewable resources.

08:42.437 --> 08:46.773
We could, by two
or three decades from now,

08:46.858 --> 08:49.993
easily be 50 percent renewables.

08:50.078 --> 08:53.246
Smith: <i>Now, one of the
people pushing forward</i>

08:53.365 --> 08:55.865
<i>with alternative energy is Elon Musk,</i>

08:55.951 --> 08:58.618
<i>an entrepreneur who's leading
the charge in solar energy</i>

08:58.704 --> 09:02.255
<i>and energy storage,
and as CEO of Tesla Motors,</i>

09:02.374 --> 09:06.343
<i>makes the most popular
all-electric car in America.</i>

09:06.428 --> 09:07.794
Hey, buddy.
How are you?

09:07.879 --> 09:09.262
Good to see you.
Good to see you.

09:09.381 --> 09:12.632
How fast can this go?
Well, pretty fast.

09:12.718 --> 09:17.220
It's, uh, zero to 60
in 3.2 seconds.

09:17.305 --> 09:19.806
Making electric cars cool
is step one.

09:19.891 --> 09:22.642
Yeah, exactly. You know, if you
had a car that was long-range,

09:22.728 --> 09:26.196
but it didn't look good and it wasn't
fun and it didn't handle properly

09:26.281 --> 09:28.148
and it didn't have great electronics,

09:28.233 --> 09:30.233
and all these important
attributes that people value...

09:30.318 --> 09:32.485
We had to change the
perception of an electric car.

09:32.571 --> 09:34.404
You know, we wanted an
electric car to be something

09:34.539 --> 09:36.906
that was sort of fun and sexy,
not something that was

09:37.042 --> 09:39.542
kind of dull and boring
like a golf cart.

09:43.665 --> 09:45.749
So you're known as a very smart guy.

09:45.884 --> 09:48.885
You're known as an inventor,
industrialist, capitalist.

09:48.970 --> 09:50.470
How did you get there?

09:50.589 --> 09:52.138
You know, when I was a teenager

09:52.257 --> 09:54.224
and going through college,
I thought about,

09:54.309 --> 09:56.059
what are the important things
that we have to solve

09:56.144 --> 09:58.024
as a species in order
for the future to be good,

09:58.096 --> 10:00.930
<i>and sustainable energy was one
of those things, obviously.</i>

10:01.016 --> 10:03.149
<i>At the time, I was thinking
of it more from the standpoint</i>

10:03.268 --> 10:05.852
<i>of we'll run out of oil
to dig out of the ground,</i>

10:05.937 --> 10:07.654
and if we don't find a replacement,

10:07.773 --> 10:09.773
then...
civilization would collapse.

10:09.908 --> 10:13.076
<i>The end game, uh, is to have
a sustainable energy future,</i>

10:13.161 --> 10:16.279
a future where we can look ahead
and say this is gonna be good.

10:16.415 --> 10:19.949
Smith: <i>A key ingredient to Tesla's
success in the car market</i>

10:20.085 --> 10:22.085
<i>is their cutting-edge
battery technology.</i>

10:22.170 --> 10:24.621
<i>And the company
is using this technology</i>

10:24.706 --> 10:27.624
<i>to solve one of sustainable
energy's biggest problems,</i>

10:27.759 --> 10:31.628
<i>the actual storage of the energy
once it's been harvested.</i>

10:31.763 --> 10:34.180
This little product
we call the Tesla Powerwall.

10:34.299 --> 10:38.685
It's designed to work very well with
solar systems right out of the box.

10:38.804 --> 10:41.638
You can actually go, if you
want, completely off-grid.

10:41.723 --> 10:43.556
You can take your solar panels,

10:43.642 --> 10:46.559
charge the battery packs,
and that's all you use.

10:48.563 --> 10:50.897
Smith: <i>Now, Powerwall batteries
are already being installed</i>

10:50.982 --> 10:54.200
<i>in homes across the US,
and stacked together,</i>

10:54.319 --> 10:57.620
<i>these batteries have the potential
to replace power plants,</i>

10:57.706 --> 11:01.407
<i>and eventually take
entire countries off the grid.</i>

11:01.493 --> 11:04.160
We need about two billion
of those to solve

11:04.296 --> 11:06.546
<i>global energy
from a storage standpoint.</i>

11:06.665 --> 11:08.498
<i>Which is a lot,
but it's roughly comparable</i>

11:08.583 --> 11:10.917
<i>to the number of cars
and trucks on the road.</i>

11:11.002 --> 11:12.552
You open-sourced
your technology,

11:12.671 --> 11:15.004
a lot of your patents, a lot of your
technology. Yeah, all of our patents.

11:15.090 --> 11:16.890
All of your patents. Why?
Yeah.

11:17.008 --> 11:21.845
If the future is bad because
we're generating too much CO2

11:21.930 --> 11:24.013
and not transitioning
to sustainable energy,

11:24.149 --> 11:26.816
then, um, I'm part of that future.

11:26.902 --> 11:28.662
Yeah. Why would you want
to be last man alive

11:28.737 --> 11:30.103
on a sinking ship?
Right.

11:30.188 --> 11:31.905
Smith: <i>And Musk isn't just pioneering</i>

11:32.023 --> 11:33.990
<i>how renewable energy s stored,</i>

11:34.075 --> 11:36.659
<i>he's also helping
to change how it's generated.</i>

11:36.745 --> 11:39.162
<i>He and his cousins founded SolarCity,</i>

11:39.247 --> 11:42.115
<i>a leading manufacturer
of solar panels.</i>

11:42.200 --> 11:44.167
What happened in the last
five years with solar power?

11:44.252 --> 11:47.292
I mean, it's just sort of grown leaps
and bounds, and where did it come from?

11:47.372 --> 11:49.589
Musk: <i>Really what's happened
with solar power is</i>

11:49.708 --> 11:51.591
<i>actually relatively steady advances</i>

11:51.710 --> 11:55.712
<i>where things have gotten better
by five to ten percent a year,</i>

11:55.847 --> 11:58.431
<i>but you add that up over a
decade or a decade and a half</i>

11:58.550 --> 11:59.830
<i>and it becomes very significant.</i>

11:59.885 --> 12:01.551
And the key threshold for solar

12:01.636 --> 12:05.054
is to try to get below the
cost of fossil fuel energy.

12:05.190 --> 12:08.441
Smith: <i>Today, solar panels
are half the price</i>

12:08.560 --> 12:10.894
<i>they were just six years ago,
and dropping fast.</i>

12:10.979 --> 12:14.731
<i>And even though solar is just beginning
to take hold here in America,</i>

12:14.816 --> 12:19.569
<i>SolarCity CTO Peter Rive told us that it's
already undercutting the traditional,</i>

12:19.654 --> 12:21.955
<i>fossil-fuel-driven
utility system.</i>

12:22.073 --> 12:25.708
In, you know, about 16 states
across the country right now,

12:25.794 --> 12:28.578
you can buy solar power
direct off your rooftop

12:28.713 --> 12:32.298
at a rate that is lower than what you're
buying power from the utility for.

12:32.417 --> 12:34.000
So we're already there.

12:34.085 --> 12:36.386
<i>Customers can sign up
with no money down</i>

12:36.471 --> 12:38.004
<i>and start saving money.</i>

12:38.089 --> 12:40.423
We sign up a new customer about
once every two minutes right now,

12:40.559 --> 12:44.344
<i>and our goal is to try to get
to a million customers by 2018,</i>

12:44.429 --> 12:46.429
<i>so there's still a lot of work to do.</i>

12:46.514 --> 12:48.765
SolarCity, we're just kind of
dedicated to the cause,

12:48.900 --> 12:51.935
and we see this as a multi-decade
problem and we just can't slow down.

12:55.941 --> 12:57.440
Solar and wind are going great.

12:57.576 --> 12:59.859
<i>They're gonna have at least
a couple decades more</i>

12:59.945 --> 13:02.495
<i>of progress where
the prices will plunge.</i>

13:02.614 --> 13:06.449
<i>Wind is now about five percent
of the total electricity</i>

13:06.585 --> 13:07.917
<i>generated in the United States.</i>

13:08.003 --> 13:09.953
<i>Hydro is six and a half percent.</i>

13:10.088 --> 13:12.505
I think wind will pass hydro
in the next couple of years.

13:12.624 --> 13:15.959
Smith: <i>And some countries
have already made renewables</i>

13:16.044 --> 13:18.294
<i>the centerpiece
of their energy strategy.</i>

13:18.380 --> 13:21.464
<i>Denmark has 14 offshore wind farms</i>

13:21.600 --> 13:24.517
<i>and in 2014 broke a world record,</i>

13:24.636 --> 13:29.355
<i>powering an average of 40 percent
of the country on wind alone.</i>

13:29.474 --> 13:32.725
<i>Claus Poulsen heads operations
at the Anholt wind farm,</i>

13:32.811 --> 13:35.361
<i>one of the largest in the world.</i>

13:48.126 --> 13:53.830
Smith: <i>Now, 400 megawatts is enough
to power about 368,000 homes.</i>

13:53.915 --> 13:55.882
<i>And it's only a fraction
of the wind power</i>

13:56.001 --> 13:58.217
<i>that's being harvested in Denmark.</i>

13:58.336 --> 14:01.304
<i>And on the windiest days,
these turbines have generated</i>

14:01.389 --> 14:05.975
<i>enough electricity to power
the country's entire grid.</i>

14:30.335 --> 14:33.703
It isn't though we can go instantly
to 100 percent renewables,

14:33.788 --> 14:36.372
or even 80 percent.
There are going to be days,

14:36.508 --> 14:41.377
<i>weeks where the wind isn't blowing
or the sun isn't shining.</i>

14:41.513 --> 14:44.213
We will still need backup power.

14:44.299 --> 14:49.218
<i>And so right now almost 20 percent of our
electricity is generated by nuclear.</i>

14:49.354 --> 14:51.304
<i>Our fleet of nuclear power plants,</i>

14:51.389 --> 14:55.274
<i>most of them built, um,
in the '60s and '70s.</i>

14:55.393 --> 14:59.195
Unless we replace them,
they will disappear.

14:59.280 --> 15:02.448
Smith: <i>Nuclear power is
the largest single source</i>

15:02.567 --> 15:04.617
<i>of carbon-free
electricity today,</i>

15:04.736 --> 15:06.176
<i>and there are two ways to produce it.</i>

15:06.237 --> 15:08.654
<i>The current method
of harvesting energy</i>

15:08.740 --> 15:10.123
<i>is through nuclear fission,</i>

15:10.241 --> 15:12.575
<i>which involves splitting atoms apart.</i>

15:12.660 --> 15:14.544
<i>Now, this type of reaction
not only fuels</i>

15:14.629 --> 15:16.662
<i>conventional nuclear power plants,</i>

15:16.748 --> 15:20.166
<i>but also is what powered
our early atomic weapons.</i>

15:20.251 --> 15:24.420
<i>But the downside of fission is that
the fuel is highly radioactive,</i>

15:24.556 --> 15:28.257
<i>and the reaction can be hard to
control, as we have seen just recently</i>

15:28.343 --> 15:33.262
<i>in 2011 at the Fukushima
nuclear power plant in Japan.</i>

15:33.348 --> 15:38.067
How does nuclear energy enter into
that debate on the environmental side,

15:38.153 --> 15:40.820
because there have been
environmental problems,

15:40.939 --> 15:42.188
Three Mile Island, Chernobyl...

15:42.273 --> 15:44.323
I looked at fission as a technology

15:44.442 --> 15:46.025
as, you know,
something we came up with

15:46.111 --> 15:48.828
<i>in the 1950s to produce
electricity on the grid</i>

15:48.947 --> 15:52.281
<i>and how can we fundamentally
reinvent that, right?</i>

15:52.367 --> 15:53.416
Right.
So how do you do that?

15:53.501 --> 15:54.501
You design a reactor

15:54.619 --> 15:56.169
that are these sealed, compact,

15:56.287 --> 15:59.705
modular units that produces
power from fission,

15:59.791 --> 16:01.290
from the splitting of uranium,

16:01.376 --> 16:04.260
whether it's decommissioned
weapons, spent nuclear fuel,

16:04.345 --> 16:05.628
a variety of solutions.

16:05.764 --> 16:07.180
All this stuff,
we don't know what to do with.

16:07.298 --> 16:08.631
All the stuff we don't know
what to do with.

16:08.716 --> 16:10.633
You take it... Take it and
produce electricity from it.

16:12.053 --> 16:13.636
Smith:
<i>In the United States alone,</i>

16:13.772 --> 16:16.139
<i>there are around 67,000 metric tons</i>

16:16.274 --> 16:18.941
<i>of spent nuclear fuel
from power plants</i>

16:19.027 --> 16:22.061
<i>and three billion metric tons
of uranium waste,</i>

16:22.147 --> 16:25.281
<i>which is extremely difficult
to dispose of safely.</i>

16:25.366 --> 16:27.900
What are we doing with all
the pits of nuclear weapons?

16:27.986 --> 16:30.036
Well, we're securing them,
and it would be great

16:30.155 --> 16:31.704
if we could burn them, eat them up,

16:31.823 --> 16:34.407
and this reactor loves this stuff.

16:34.492 --> 16:36.626
<i>So it's a molten-salt reactor,
and one of the things</i>

16:36.711 --> 16:38.711
<i>when I set out to design
a power reactor</i>

16:38.830 --> 16:41.964
<i>was it had to be passively
and intrinsically safe.</i>

16:42.050 --> 16:45.635
<i>In the event of an accident, you
can actually just drain the core</i>

16:45.720 --> 16:47.420
<i>and the reaction stops.</i>

16:47.505 --> 16:50.756
These reactors run for 30
years without refueling.

16:52.343 --> 16:53.976
How big is it?
Um, very small.

16:54.062 --> 16:56.429
I mean, you're talking
for a few tens of megawatts,

16:56.514 --> 16:59.098
<i>something that's no bigger
than three meters in diameter</i>

16:59.184 --> 17:00.516
<i>for the reactor module.</i>

17:00.652 --> 17:03.102
So three meters, so this...
this big around circle?

17:03.188 --> 17:04.520
Yeah.
And have a reactor...

17:04.656 --> 17:05.821
<i>Yes.
that can power...</i>

17:05.906 --> 17:07.440
<i>Tens of thousands of homes.</i>

17:07.525 --> 17:09.826
Smith: <i>Now, these small
modular reactors</i>

17:09.911 --> 17:11.493
<i>are not only safe and compact,</i>

17:11.579 --> 17:13.913
<i>but they actually
eat up the radioactive waste</i>

17:14.031 --> 17:16.115
<i>from weapons and old reactors.</i>

17:16.201 --> 17:18.501
<i>And they leave behind
only a tiny fraction</i>

17:18.586 --> 17:21.503
<i>of the new waste
created by today's plants.</i>

17:21.589 --> 17:24.207
<i>And all of these factors
would make them easy to deploy</i>

17:24.291 --> 17:28.094
<i>to power communities
around the country.</i>

17:28.213 --> 17:30.573
In five years, we could have a
prototype, a proof of concept,

17:30.598 --> 17:32.849
of that reactor that we
can go and manufacture.

17:32.934 --> 17:34.934
And that's what we need
to make a difference,

17:35.053 --> 17:37.103
that's what this
technology represents.

17:37.222 --> 17:39.272
For me, my holy grail
is nuclear fusion.

17:39.390 --> 17:43.059
Smith: <i>Fusion is the nuclear reaction</i>

17:43.194 --> 17:45.645
<i>that has powered our sun
for billions of years.</i>

17:45.730 --> 17:48.064
<i>The fuel is virtually limitless,</i>

17:48.149 --> 17:51.367
<i>and produces
no carbon or toxic waste.</i>

17:51.452 --> 17:53.736
<i>With a fusion nuclear reaction,</i>

17:53.821 --> 17:55.488
<i>energy is actually created</i>

17:55.573 --> 17:58.624
<i>during a high-speed collision
of atoms combining.</i>

17:58.743 --> 18:02.461
<i>The Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory in California</i>

18:02.580 --> 18:06.299
<i>is the premier fusion facility
in the United States.</i>

18:06.417 --> 18:07.750
Fusion is where we're going to.

18:07.886 --> 18:09.635
Fusion is the energy source we need

18:09.754 --> 18:13.089
if we're going to exist thousands of
years as a society in the future.

18:13.224 --> 18:16.259
Smith: We're looking at
making a star or a sun,

18:16.394 --> 18:20.096
in a very contained way, here on Earth.
Now, isn't that dangerous?

18:20.231 --> 18:23.566
It's actually not dangerous. It only
happens for a brief split second.

18:23.651 --> 18:26.519
There's no chain reaction,
and so there's no runaway

18:26.604 --> 18:28.237
there's no meltdown,
nothing like that.

18:28.323 --> 18:30.273
The problem is,
it's really hard to do,

18:30.358 --> 18:32.275
and that's why
we've built this facility,

18:32.360 --> 18:35.328
<i>the largest laser facility
ever built.</i>

18:35.446 --> 18:37.863
Smith: <i>To find out exactly
how humans are actually</i>

18:37.949 --> 18:39.448
<i>making miniature stars on Earth,</i>

18:39.584 --> 18:41.117
<i>we talked to Mark Herrmann,</i>

18:41.252 --> 18:42.952
<i>the director of the facility.</i>

18:43.037 --> 18:44.620
So this is literally the future,

18:44.706 --> 18:48.291
so much so that they actually
shot "Star Trek" here

18:48.376 --> 18:51.961
<i>because it's the most advanced
facility of its kind in the world.</i>

18:52.046 --> 18:55.464
<i>So they were saying, "Well, it'll look
something like this going forward."</i>

18:55.600 --> 18:58.801
Maybe you could explain to us where we
are and what we're actually seeing?

18:58.886 --> 19:02.972
Herrmann: <i>Sure. So we're in
the world's largest laser.</i>

19:03.057 --> 19:06.309
<i>The laser bay itself is actually
the size of three football fields.</i>

19:06.394 --> 19:10.313
<i>And we use all that space
to concentrate the energy</i>

19:10.448 --> 19:13.532
to heat up this tiny target
to the conditions found

19:13.651 --> 19:16.369
<i>in nuclear weapons and in order
to try and achieve fusion.</i>

19:16.487 --> 19:19.822
<i>So this whole facility is all about</i>

19:19.907 --> 19:22.658
<i>getting that energy
in the right place,</i>

19:22.744 --> 19:26.579
<i>with the right intensity, to
squeeze on that fusion capsule</i>

19:26.664 --> 19:29.582
<i>and implode it into
fusion conditions.</i>

19:36.557 --> 19:38.507
Smith: Can you make
a fusion reaction?

19:38.593 --> 19:40.509
We do make fusion reactions
all the time, right.

19:40.645 --> 19:44.096
We don't make fusion reactions
that give us out more energy

19:44.182 --> 19:47.233
than we invested to, uh, create it.
So you don't have ignition?

19:47.352 --> 19:50.936
We don't have ignition, right. That's the
research program we're doing right now.

19:51.022 --> 19:52.521
So that's the goal.
That's the goal.

19:52.657 --> 19:54.440
Is to get to ignition
where you get more energy out

19:54.525 --> 19:56.409
than you're putting in.
Exactly right.

19:56.527 --> 19:58.327
Smith: <i>Now, once
ignition is achieved,</i>

19:58.413 --> 20:01.163
<i>we will be on the first step
of generating virtually</i>

20:01.249 --> 20:04.250
<i>unlimited emissions-free
electricity.</i>

20:04.369 --> 20:06.452
And the hope there
is if you can do it once,

20:06.537 --> 20:08.871
if you can demonstrate
how to make it work, right,

20:09.007 --> 20:10.373
we can get more efficient.

20:10.458 --> 20:11.957
The analogy is
the Wright brothers, right.

20:12.043 --> 20:14.093
Smith: <i>So the Wright
brothers have flight,</i>

20:14.212 --> 20:17.930
<i>60, 70 years later we're
in space, so very rapid.</i>

20:18.049 --> 20:22.601
What was the "We're flying"
moment for fusion?

20:22.720 --> 20:27.106
It would be, you know, the first
thermonuclear weapons back in the 1950s.

20:27.225 --> 20:31.444
If an atomic bomb was the glider,
this is the first engine.

20:31.562 --> 20:33.979
Yes. And now what we're looking to do

20:34.065 --> 20:36.532
is get to Apollo?
Exactly.

20:36.617 --> 20:39.735
Smith: <i>Now, because it's
the holy grail of energy,</i>

20:39.821 --> 20:42.321
<i>countries all over the world
are working together</i>

20:42.407 --> 20:44.573
<i>in the race to get us up
to Apollo level.</i>

20:44.709 --> 20:46.575
<i>And ground zero for that effort</i>

20:46.711 --> 20:49.462
<i>is a massive construction
project in Southern France.</i>

20:49.580 --> 20:52.081
So we're here in Provence,
the South of France,

20:52.216 --> 20:56.052
uh, and that massive project
over there is called ITER,

20:56.137 --> 20:58.754
<i>which is going to be
the largest and most expensive</i>

20:58.890 --> 21:01.590
<i>science project ever made.</i>

21:01.676 --> 21:04.009
<i>Now, instead
of using laser technology,</i>

21:04.095 --> 21:07.346
<i>this $16 billion project
uses magnetic fields</i>

21:07.432 --> 21:11.600
<i>in a giant doughnut-shaped
structure called a tokamak.</i>

21:11.686 --> 21:16.439
<i>We spoke with the director general of
the ITER organization, Bernard Bigot.</i>

21:16.574 --> 21:21.827
Now, basically this sort of developed
world is all together to fund this.

21:21.946 --> 21:23.162
How many countries?

21:32.540 --> 21:34.423
And so this is the future
of energy right here?

21:34.509 --> 21:36.675
We're standing
in the future of energy.

21:43.101 --> 21:44.383
When's it ready to go?

21:49.474 --> 21:51.974
Smith: <i>Now, ITER is
essentially a larger version</i>

21:52.059 --> 21:55.694
<i>of a working fusion generator in
Great Britain that's called JET.</i>

21:55.813 --> 21:59.865
<i>It holds the current record
for fusion energy produced.</i>

21:59.984 --> 22:04.487
<i>The operations at JET are
overseen by Dr. Steven Cowley.</i>

22:04.572 --> 22:06.989
We're here inside
the practice facility.

22:07.074 --> 22:09.125
This is a mock-up
of the real machine.

22:09.210 --> 22:11.994
And the plasma, which is the hot fuel

22:12.130 --> 22:14.380
in the form of an ionized gas,

22:14.499 --> 22:18.000
will be sitting basically
here, filling up this space.

22:18.085 --> 22:21.470
<i>And each fusion reaction
will add heat to the plasma,</i>

22:21.556 --> 22:24.924
<i>and if you get enough of that,
it will start to burn.</i>

22:25.009 --> 22:28.727
That will be the fusion burn that
we've wanted for so many years.

22:31.599 --> 22:34.650
Electronic countdown:
Five, four, three,

22:34.735 --> 22:37.520
two, one, zero.

22:41.742 --> 22:43.692
Right here you
can see the exhaust system

22:43.828 --> 22:46.328
of the plasma here,
and touching at the top here.

22:46.414 --> 22:48.247
The plasma's right inside here.

22:49.951 --> 22:52.034
<i>There's gonna be a day
that you're sitting</i>

22:52.119 --> 22:55.004
<i>in the control room, and the plasma,</i>

22:55.089 --> 22:58.674
the fusion fuel inside the
magnetic cage, begins to burn.

22:58.759 --> 23:03.212
<i>It begins to do so much fusion
that it sustains itself,</i>

23:03.347 --> 23:06.432
essentially no energy going in,
half a gigawatt coming out.

23:06.551 --> 23:10.886
That moment will be one of the great
historic moments of science, ever.

23:10.972 --> 23:14.557
<i>Fusion is the perfect way
to make energy.</i>

23:14.692 --> 23:19.228
It's clean, it's safe,
it doesn't produce CO2.

23:19.363 --> 23:22.565
It is definitely the energy
source of the future.

23:25.903 --> 23:28.737
The world is firmly committed
to a low-carbon future,

23:28.823 --> 23:32.074
and that has the potential to
unleash investment and innovation

23:32.210 --> 23:36.745
<i>in clean energy at a scale
we have never seen before.</i>

23:36.881 --> 23:41.166
So I believe this moment can be
a turning point for the world.

23:43.254 --> 23:47.590
Eventually, we are going to have
to move to sustainable energy.

23:47.675 --> 23:49.892
<i>The question is, really,
between now and then,</i>

23:49.977 --> 23:52.928
<i>how much carbon do
we put in the environment?</i>

23:53.014 --> 23:56.065
How much damage will we do
in the meantime? Exactly.

23:56.150 --> 23:59.518
Chu: <i>This is the time
we start acting,</i>

23:59.604 --> 24:01.770
<i>and start really pushing,
really saying,</i>

24:01.906 --> 24:04.323
this is an issue,
it's got to be solved.

24:04.442 --> 24:08.777
Wilson: <i>Fundamentally, we can
take all the uses of energy today</i>

24:08.913 --> 24:11.030
and do them
without using fossil fuels,

24:11.115 --> 24:13.282
<i>whether it's development
of renewables,</i>

24:13.367 --> 24:15.751
<i>development of storage,
development of fusion.</i>

24:15.836 --> 24:18.671
It's potentially a big crisis,
but it's also potentially

24:18.789 --> 24:21.173
a big opportunity for change.

24:22.627 --> 24:25.044
Smith: <i>Now, what we learned
in making this documentary</i>

24:25.129 --> 24:27.880
is that humanity already has
the technology to make

24:27.965 --> 24:30.132
clean and virtually limitless energy.

24:30.217 --> 24:32.718
<i>And with enough effort,
we can actually meet the goals</i>

24:32.803 --> 24:34.603
<i>that are laid out
in the Paris agreement.</i>

24:34.689 --> 24:36.939
<i>But what we have to do now</i>

24:37.024 --> 24:40.776
<i>is keep pushing our politicians
and our energy providers,</i>

24:40.861 --> 24:43.562
<i>as well as using our
purchasing power, to make sure</i>

24:43.648 --> 24:45.981
<i>that we speed up
the adoption of renewables</i>

24:46.117 --> 24:48.150
<i>and speed up the process
towards fusion,</i>

24:48.235 --> 24:51.487
so that we can actually
implement these solutions

24:51.572 --> 24:53.238
before it's too late.
