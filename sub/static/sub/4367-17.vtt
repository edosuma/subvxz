00:01.692 --> 00:04.075
You are being watched.

00:04.078 --> 00:06.395
The government
has a secret system.

00:06.397 --> 00:10.499
A machine that spies on you
every hour of every day.

00:10.501 --> 00:13.369
I designed the machine
to detect acts of terror,

00:13.371 --> 00:15.171
but it sees everything.

00:15.173 --> 00:18.741
Violent crimes
involving ordinary people.

00:18.743 --> 00:21.627
The government considers
these people irrelevant.

00:21.629 --> 00:23.679
We don't.

00:23.681 --> 00:28.217
Hunted by the authorities,
we work in secret.

00:28.219 --> 00:30.036
You will never find us.

00:30.038 --> 00:34.106
But victim or perpetrator,
if your number's up,

00:34.108 --> 00:35.676
we'll find you.

_

00:42.863 --> 00:44.363
_

00:44.451 --> 00:46.903
The storm warning
is for the coastal areas

00:46.905 --> 00:48.838
of Nassau
and Suffolk counties,

00:48.840 --> 00:51.791
including East and South Hampton
and Owen Island.

00:51.793 --> 00:53.793
Heavy rains
and destructive winds

00:53.795 --> 00:55.411
will continue
into the night.

00:55.413 --> 00:58.381
Residents are advised
to prepare for evacuation.

01:04.421 --> 01:07.340
Isn't this service vest
a little unethical?

01:07.342 --> 01:11.460
I am handi-capable, Mr. Reese,
but I need some assistance.

01:11.462 --> 01:15.514
We don't want to exclude Bear
from our rainy day activities.

01:15.516 --> 01:19.068
We should have seen
<i>Once Upon A Time In The West.</i>

01:19.070 --> 01:21.821
Fewer subtitles.

01:21.823 --> 01:24.824
Any word from our
dearly departed Agent Shaw?

01:24.826 --> 01:26.492
Not a whisper.

01:26.494 --> 01:28.310
What worries me more at
the moment is that we haven't

01:28.312 --> 01:31.030
heard anything from
the machine recently either.

01:31.032 --> 01:35.117
Yes, I've noticed.
Three days. No numbers.

01:35.119 --> 01:37.370
Maybe we're finally
cleaning up the streets.

01:37.372 --> 01:39.088
As much as I'd like that,

01:39.090 --> 01:41.290
I have to wonder if it hasn't
got something to do

01:41.292 --> 01:44.493
with the actually
departed Kara Stanton.

01:44.495 --> 01:47.162
The virus that she uploaded
during the time you spent

01:47.164 --> 01:50.132
in your bomb vest
could easily have spread

01:50.134 --> 01:52.134
from the Department
of Defense systems,

01:52.136 --> 01:54.003
all the way
to the machine.

01:54.005 --> 01:57.006
You built the machine, Finch.
Can't you access it?

01:57.008 --> 01:58.524
You know,
check under the hood?

01:58.526 --> 02:01.510
I sealed it for
a reason, Mr. Reese.

02:01.512 --> 02:03.195
I'm afraid you're going
to have to wait and see

02:03.197 --> 02:06.232
what Stanton's employers
have in mind for the future.

02:08.000 --> 02:14.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:21.849 --> 02:24.867
Maybe your machine
really is on the fritz.

02:24.869 --> 02:26.869
Has this ever
happened before, Finch?

02:26.871 --> 02:28.254
It's a precedent.

02:28.256 --> 02:30.840
It gave us all six
numbers at once?

02:30.842 --> 02:33.059
Spread out across
the country like this.

02:33.061 --> 02:34.844
Very worrisome.

02:34.846 --> 02:38.898
Stranger yet, I can find no
solid connection between them.

02:38.900 --> 02:41.517
Maybe they're
plotting something together.

02:41.519 --> 02:43.402
Or someone's plotting
against them.

02:43.404 --> 02:45.237
I wondered that.

02:45.239 --> 02:47.740
Three of the six numbers
are listed on the NCIC

02:47.742 --> 02:49.909
missing persons database.

02:49.911 --> 02:52.445
Two of the others dropped
off the grid entirely.

02:52.447 --> 02:55.031
No digital footprint at all.

02:55.033 --> 02:58.250
People with something to hide
or hiding from something.

02:58.252 --> 03:00.736
And there's one local.
Jack Rollins.

03:00.738 --> 03:03.572
He's an antiques dealer
in Brooklyn.

03:03.574 --> 03:05.841
He hasn't been
reported missing yet.

03:05.843 --> 03:08.177
That could be the next target.

03:08.179 --> 03:10.046
I'll go say hi.

03:10.048 --> 03:12.581
I'll enlist Carter's help
looking into the other five.

03:12.583 --> 03:14.050
And I'll keep an eye

03:14.052 --> 03:17.103
on the machine's
erratic behavior.

03:22.393 --> 03:23.776
Looks like Rollins
runs his shop

03:23.778 --> 03:25.528
out of his apartment, Finch.

03:25.530 --> 03:28.614
There's no answer,
so I'm going to let myself in.

03:30.033 --> 03:33.435
Rollins' taste
in antiques is exotic.

03:33.437 --> 03:39.158
No sign of the man himself.

03:42.946 --> 03:47.333
But someone was already here
and went to a lot of effort

03:47.335 --> 03:51.137
to dig up a bill
for a rental property

03:51.139 --> 03:52.738
out on Owen Island.

03:52.740 --> 03:55.958
I found the account
for Jack Rollins' Visa.

03:55.960 --> 03:58.427
Payments on the beach property
and a train ticket

03:58.429 --> 04:01.313
to Suffolk County,
all in the last 24 hours.

04:01.315 --> 04:04.350
Rollins was in a hurry
to get out of the city.

04:04.352 --> 04:06.485
And we're not the only ones
looking for him.

04:06.487 --> 04:08.804
Heading out in
a storm like this?

04:08.806 --> 04:10.606
Rollins is running
from something.

04:10.608 --> 04:12.575
I'll find out
what's on Owen Island.

04:12.577 --> 04:14.643
Mr. Reese,
is that a good idea?

04:14.645 --> 04:17.913
Storm or no, Finch,
if Rollins is our one lead,

04:17.915 --> 04:20.533
I'm headed
to the beach.

04:28.625 --> 04:30.926
Next time you need a favor,
can we wait till after

04:30.928 --> 04:32.344
the monsoon season?

04:32.346 --> 04:35.548
Thanks for your help, Moss.

04:38.802 --> 04:42.805
- These files seem a little thin.
- Because the cases are then.

04:42.807 --> 04:44.890
Dozens of reasons people
step off the grid.

04:44.892 --> 04:46.609
Bad credit, old rap sheet.

04:46.611 --> 04:48.844
I mean, hell, sometimes people
just disappear, Detective.

04:48.846 --> 04:50.980
First person to go missing
was a French student

04:50.982 --> 04:53.849
studying abroad at Stanford,
seven years ago.

04:53.851 --> 04:56.569
Post-collegiate wanderlust.
Wouldn't be the first.

04:56.571 --> 04:58.287
What's your interest?

04:58.289 --> 04:59.822
What's the name
at the bottom of that file?

04:59.824 --> 05:01.240
It's on the others too.

05:01.242 --> 05:03.025
Alan Fahey.

05:03.027 --> 05:05.211
Desk jockey
at our CCSR branch.

05:05.213 --> 05:07.413
Handles cybercrimes,
identity theft,

05:07.415 --> 05:09.298
mostly white collar stuff.

05:09.300 --> 05:11.550
Looks like he files
one hell of a report.

05:11.552 --> 05:13.368
Yeah, he has
a lot of notes.

05:13.370 --> 05:14.870
Seems like
he's on to something.

05:14.872 --> 05:16.505
If you want,
I can give him a call.

05:16.507 --> 05:18.090
- See what he's--
- No, that's okay.

05:18.092 --> 05:19.808
I can handle the follow-up.

05:19.810 --> 05:22.561
Well, I'm gonna
beat the rain home.

05:22.563 --> 05:24.763
Okay.

05:24.765 --> 05:26.590
Agent Moss?

05:28.886 --> 05:30.936
I've been doing this job
a long time.

05:30.938 --> 05:33.072
Heh, probably too long.

05:33.074 --> 05:35.658
All that business
about Cal Beecher...

05:35.660 --> 05:37.026
what do you know?

05:37.028 --> 05:39.245
Been doing my job
for a long time too.

05:39.247 --> 05:41.830
And not having those IAB files,
I can only surmise,

05:41.832 --> 05:44.450
but the kind of red flags
they put up,

05:44.452 --> 05:46.168
Beecher is bad news.

05:46.170 --> 05:47.956
Steer clear, Carter.

05:52.057 --> 05:53.859
Okay...

06:02.019 --> 06:03.352
This is Special Agent Fahey.

06:03.354 --> 06:05.437
This is Detective Carter
of the NYPD.

06:05.439 --> 06:07.273
I've been looking through
some missing person files

06:07.275 --> 06:09.108
that have your notes
on them.

06:09.110 --> 06:11.143
The cases were connected
through one potential MO,

06:11.145 --> 06:13.279
something about missing
or destroyed photos

06:13.281 --> 06:15.731
you uncovered at more than one
potential crime scene.

06:15.733 --> 06:18.534
Have you been able to chase down
any new leads on that MO?

06:18.536 --> 06:20.869
I work out of headquarters
in DC, Detective.

06:20.871 --> 06:23.122
I don't chase leads.
I write reports...

06:23.124 --> 06:24.623
that no one reads.

06:24.625 --> 06:27.126
Right. But I might
have a new informant

06:27.128 --> 06:29.912
with additional information
for this case.

06:29.914 --> 06:31.964
Well, I put all that
information together months ago.

06:31.966 --> 06:34.500
I called the NYPD at the time.
No one there was helpful.

06:34.502 --> 06:36.468
No one had
anything to add.

06:36.470 --> 06:38.954
Now something suddenly
just popped up?

06:38.956 --> 06:41.223
It's a confidential source.

06:41.225 --> 06:44.977
Confidential from the FBI?
Nice try.

06:44.979 --> 06:47.346
Call the Bureau Liaison
if you have any new information,

06:47.348 --> 06:49.965
otherwise have a nice day.

06:51.635 --> 06:54.403
Congratulations on your new...

06:58.309 --> 07:00.475
They're evacuating
the island, Finch.

07:00.477 --> 07:02.811
But I made it out
to Rollins' rental house.

07:02.813 --> 07:04.363
Where are you?

07:04.365 --> 07:06.749
Well, I'm back
at Rollins' in Brooklyn.

07:06.751 --> 07:09.168
Bumping around in the dark.

07:09.170 --> 07:11.086
Storm knocked out a transformer
down on the street

07:11.088 --> 07:13.672
and all power within
a nine-block radius.

07:13.674 --> 07:15.124
Why go back there?

07:15.126 --> 07:16.842
Detective Carter
spoke with an FBI agent

07:16.844 --> 07:19.628
who's discovered a pattern
in the crimes.

07:19.630 --> 07:21.964
There were no photographs
of the missing persons

07:21.966 --> 07:23.498
at their homes.

07:23.500 --> 07:28.220
So I'm looking for photos,
or a lack thereof.

07:32.175 --> 07:34.343
What's this?

07:34.345 --> 07:37.396
"Basement storage."

07:38.898 --> 07:41.174
I'm gonna take
a look downstairs, Bear.

07:41.786 --> 07:44.192
Nothing to worry about.

08:03.223 --> 08:07.976
Empty photo frames.
Just like the others.

08:07.978 --> 08:09.878
Mr. Reese, I've found
something interesting

08:09.880 --> 08:11.347
in Rollins' basement.

08:11.349 --> 08:13.382
Finch, I didn't copy.

08:13.384 --> 08:15.734
Finch?

08:21.275 --> 08:23.892
Finch?

08:23.894 --> 08:25.361
I'm not alone.

08:28.499 --> 08:29.782
Bear?

08:31.568 --> 08:33.919
What are you doing?

08:36.907 --> 08:39.258
What is it?

08:53.773 --> 08:56.308
Mr. Reese, I think
I know what happened

08:56.310 --> 08:58.694
to all those
missing people.

09:17.987 --> 09:19.237
FBI, don't move.

09:19.239 --> 09:22.240
Hands up. I want
to see some ID.

09:22.242 --> 09:24.109
Well, which is it?

09:24.111 --> 09:28.663
You want my hands up,
or you want to see ID?

09:31.851 --> 09:36.738
Jennings.
US Marshals Service.

09:36.740 --> 09:39.457
I'm trying to locate someone,
a guy named Rollins.

09:39.459 --> 09:41.092
Got some questions for him.

09:41.094 --> 09:42.344
You looking for Rollins?
Me too.

09:42.346 --> 09:43.628
I believe
he's connected to--

09:43.630 --> 09:45.513
To another
missing persons case.

09:45.515 --> 09:48.800
We believe a wanted fugitive
may be looking for Rollins.

09:48.802 --> 09:50.135
Is he here?

09:50.137 --> 09:52.570
I don't know.
I just started looking.

09:52.572 --> 09:54.022
Well, why don't
we take our weapons

09:54.024 --> 09:57.392
off each other
and clear this house?

10:02.231 --> 10:04.032
Trail was hot on Rollins,
but no one at HQ

10:04.034 --> 10:05.834
would get off their hands,
follow up the lead.

10:05.836 --> 10:07.902
So I decided
to come out here myself.

10:09.373 --> 10:10.938
You out here all alone?

10:10.940 --> 10:12.774
Well, it's been
a few years since Quantico,

10:12.776 --> 10:15.777
but I remember a thing or two
about working in the field.

10:15.779 --> 10:18.713
Well, you're
on the right trail.

10:18.715 --> 10:20.615
Rollins was here recently,
he couldn't have gotten far

10:20.617 --> 10:22.500
in this storm.

10:22.502 --> 10:24.118
My car is outside.

10:24.120 --> 10:25.587
Why don't we head
to the local police station?

10:25.589 --> 10:27.706
We're gonna need
a few more guys on this.

10:31.510 --> 10:33.728
Someone tried
to destroy these teeth.

10:33.730 --> 10:37.816
But the flame wasn't hot enough
to burn enamel.

10:37.818 --> 10:39.684
It could take
some time, but...

10:39.686 --> 10:41.636
if the vic's dentals
are on file,

10:41.638 --> 10:43.355
we could get an ID.

10:43.357 --> 10:44.856
No, we can't wait that long.

10:44.858 --> 10:47.108
Assuming that the teeth
belong to Jack Rollins,

10:47.110 --> 10:49.411
he was likely dead
when they were removed.

10:49.413 --> 10:50.978
One would hope so, anyway.

10:50.980 --> 10:53.832
Well, whoever did this
knows how to get rid of a body.

10:53.834 --> 10:56.718
They didn't just
want to kill Rollins,

10:56.720 --> 10:58.670
they wanted him
to disappear.

10:58.672 --> 11:01.122
We may be looking at more than
a string of missing persons.

11:01.124 --> 11:04.075
We may be looking
at a string of murders.

11:04.077 --> 11:05.844
Six victims.

11:05.846 --> 11:10.432
If our killer can
assume these identities,

11:10.434 --> 11:14.102
then he would be a composite
of all these missing persons

11:14.104 --> 11:16.271
in more ways than one.

11:16.273 --> 11:18.922
We're looking
at a serial killer.

11:24.847 --> 11:26.614
Finch, what are you doing?

11:26.616 --> 11:28.616
Mr. Reese is out on an island
looking for a man violent enough

11:28.618 --> 11:30.452
to pull out
another man's teeth.

11:30.454 --> 11:33.121
And now I can't warn him.
I have to get there myself.

11:33.123 --> 11:35.990
I'm pretty sure
all the roads are closed now.

11:35.992 --> 11:37.826
How do you think
you're gonna get out there?

11:37.828 --> 11:40.175
Think I'll use
my pilot's license.

11:44.834 --> 11:47.635
I got a nor'easter
touching down right now.

11:47.637 --> 11:50.505
I've got a population
of 357 souls

11:50.507 --> 11:53.751
I've got to get off this island
before I can't anymore.

11:55.479 --> 11:58.146
Chief of police is running
the evacuation on the mainland.

11:58.148 --> 12:01.816
I'm the law left in the town
with half its ass underwater.

12:01.818 --> 12:04.986
This is a matter
of federal importance.

12:04.988 --> 12:08.022
- We're looking for this man.
- Don't recognize him.

12:08.024 --> 12:11.826
But if he was a renter,
he's probably been evacuated.

12:11.828 --> 12:14.228
Chief? Chief, come in.

12:14.230 --> 12:15.947
Mind if we at least
make a few phone calls

12:15.949 --> 12:17.732
- while we're here?
- Sure.

12:17.734 --> 12:19.834
If the cell
and land lines weren't down,

12:19.836 --> 12:21.953
the power wasn't out,
and the emergency radio

12:21.955 --> 12:23.788
didn't pick today
to crap out on me.

12:23.790 --> 12:26.541
- Anything else?
- Yeah. How's your coffee?

12:26.543 --> 12:29.410
Hey, gents, you may have
jurisdiction and authority here,

12:29.412 --> 12:31.763
but one thing you don't have
is my cooperation.

12:31.765 --> 12:34.682
For now, mother nature
takes priority.

12:38.772 --> 12:42.307
Look, Marshal, we can't afford
to sit around here

12:42.309 --> 12:46.110
with or without
the deputy's help.

12:46.112 --> 12:50.097
I don't think we're on the trail
of just a missing person here.

12:50.099 --> 12:53.451
I think Rollins is dead,
and he may not be the only one.

12:53.453 --> 12:56.270
I think we're on the trail
of a cold-blooded killer.

12:56.272 --> 12:59.123
You didn't want
to share this earlier?

12:59.125 --> 13:00.625
Well, I didn't
know all the facts.

13:00.627 --> 13:04.712
Technically,
it's still just a theory.

13:04.714 --> 13:08.132
Tell me, what do you know
about making a body disappear?

13:19.929 --> 13:24.482
This place
is a ghost town.

13:24.484 --> 13:28.686
Yeah. Our uni's
out are storm patrol.

13:28.688 --> 13:30.605
What brings you down here?

13:30.607 --> 13:32.240
You.

13:32.242 --> 13:34.909
I would have called,
but you're not answering those,

13:34.911 --> 13:36.995
are you?

13:36.997 --> 13:39.647
So I decided to drop by,
and maybe you could tell me

13:39.649 --> 13:41.449
what I did wrong.

13:41.451 --> 13:46.421
Cal, I'm working on something.
I'll talk when I can.

13:48.340 --> 13:52.093
I guess
I'll check in later.

14:01.770 --> 14:03.605
So how'd you get
stuck on the island?

14:03.607 --> 14:05.773
We got water in the muffler
and the engine died,

14:05.775 --> 14:08.226
so we came here--
Carly and I.

14:08.228 --> 14:10.395
That's my new bride
Carly over there.

14:10.397 --> 14:12.947
We just got married.
We're both dental hygienists.

14:12.949 --> 14:16.868
- Did I say that?
- Yes.

14:18.954 --> 14:20.788
What did you mean earlier
when you said Rollins

14:20.790 --> 14:22.907
wasn't the only one?

14:25.528 --> 14:27.695
I think we're on the trail
of several crimes.

14:27.697 --> 14:30.131
I'm looking at multiple murders
across multiple states.

14:30.133 --> 14:32.467
The killer must have taken
the identity of his victim

14:32.469 --> 14:34.085
before moving on.

14:34.087 --> 14:36.170
I followed the trail back
to that student at Stanford,

14:36.172 --> 14:37.889
then I worked forward.

14:37.891 --> 14:39.591
It turns out every victim
of the killer moved cities

14:39.593 --> 14:41.259
within 18 months
of vanishing.

14:41.261 --> 14:43.478
Rollins moved to New York.

14:43.480 --> 14:45.930
So I went to New York,
found the rental bill.

14:45.932 --> 14:47.982
Followed him out here
to Owen Island.

14:47.984 --> 14:49.884
Whoever was
traveling as Rollins

14:49.886 --> 14:52.687
could easily still
be on this island.

14:57.611 --> 15:00.028
Hi. Erica, we just
lost the bridge.

15:00.030 --> 15:01.996
When did this happen, Stan?

15:01.998 --> 15:03.581
A few minutes ago.

15:03.583 --> 15:05.617
I locked up the bar,
I saw Becky finishing the boards

15:05.619 --> 15:06.951
on the A&P.

15:06.953 --> 15:08.252
We high-tailed it
down to the bridge

15:08.254 --> 15:09.621
just in time
to see it go under.

15:09.623 --> 15:11.789
No crossing it until
the tides go down.

15:11.791 --> 15:15.126
- And who's this guy?
- Dennis Cunningham.

15:15.128 --> 15:17.011
I picked a bad day
to check up on my hotel.

15:17.013 --> 15:18.963
So you're the guy
building that hotel?

15:18.965 --> 15:20.465
On my drier days.

15:20.467 --> 15:21.933
We're 90 days out
on that property.

15:21.935 --> 15:24.185
- If it washes away--
- There's more.

15:24.187 --> 15:25.419
On the way here,
we saw someone.

15:25.421 --> 15:27.105
Down by the docks.

15:27.107 --> 15:28.773
Did it look like it was
trying to get off the island?

15:28.775 --> 15:33.260
Looked like he was
prepping a boat for himself.

15:33.262 --> 15:34.612
We have to get down there.

15:34.614 --> 15:36.364
I've now got
five stranded people

15:36.366 --> 15:39.266
and no way off this rock,
this is where I need to be.

15:39.268 --> 15:41.119
Absolutely, Deputy.

15:41.121 --> 15:44.706
So we'll go and bring
him back here for you.

16:02.474 --> 16:04.509
Special kind of man
ricks his life in this weather

16:04.511 --> 16:06.561
for a few crustaceans.

16:06.563 --> 16:10.631
Whoa, fellas,
I'm just a fisherman.

16:10.633 --> 16:12.150
There's a lot of money
in this haul.

16:12.152 --> 16:14.402
I didn't know
I was breaking a law.

16:14.404 --> 16:15.820
You have ID?

16:15.822 --> 16:18.239
Don't get asked for it
on the water.

16:18.241 --> 16:20.992
- What's your name?
- Ethan Mattson.

16:20.994 --> 16:22.777
Well, Ethan,
you're on land now.

16:25.415 --> 16:27.648
- Who's with you?
- No one.

16:27.650 --> 16:28.916
Hey!

16:28.918 --> 16:30.785
I know you're there.

16:30.787 --> 16:33.421
I've got 15 shots here.

16:33.423 --> 16:35.656
Think it over.

16:35.658 --> 16:37.425
No need for shooting!

16:37.427 --> 16:40.161
I was just looking to get
away from this storm is all!

16:40.163 --> 16:41.629
You from the island?

16:41.631 --> 16:43.381
No, I was looking for
some work on the boats.

16:43.383 --> 16:46.500
Got stuck out here by the storm,
thought I'd ride it out.

16:48.604 --> 16:51.355
Let's get them both
back to the station.

17:06.538 --> 17:09.290
I don't care who you are,
you can't endanger my citizens

17:09.291 --> 17:13.161
by landing your Cessna
in the middle of my town.

17:13.163 --> 17:16.464
That's actually
a De Havilland Beaver.

17:16.465 --> 17:18.082
What's going on here?

17:18.084 --> 17:21.868
This amateur storm chaser
Harold Gull is under arrest.

17:21.871 --> 17:24.055
He landed his float plane
in the town square.

17:24.057 --> 17:26.424
I needed a stretch of water
to land and there was, well,

17:26.425 --> 17:28.392
water everywhere.

17:28.394 --> 17:31.545
- And what's all this?
- My meteorological equipment.

17:31.547 --> 17:33.898
I've been a certified member
of the National Storm Chasers

17:33.900 --> 17:37.902
and Spotters Association
for over ten years.

17:39.688 --> 17:44.659
Deputy, despite
this man's recklessness,

17:44.661 --> 17:47.245
could you book him
with endangering our lives

17:47.247 --> 17:48.746
after the storm?

17:48.748 --> 17:50.397
We have bigger things
to worry about.

17:50.399 --> 17:52.066
Fine.

17:52.068 --> 17:55.036
But when the storm ends,
I'm hitting him

17:55.038 --> 17:59.240
with everything
I've got.

17:59.242 --> 18:01.843
Hey, Stan, it's getting
dark out there.

18:01.845 --> 18:03.211
You think you could
put some more diesel

18:03.213 --> 18:04.545
in the gennie out back?

18:04.547 --> 18:07.715
Yeah, sure.

18:25.701 --> 18:28.736
The National Storm
Chasers Association, Harold?

18:28.738 --> 18:30.404
Well, it worked, didn't it?

18:30.406 --> 18:34.041
We were wrong.
This isn't a group conspiracy.

18:34.043 --> 18:37.295
Those numbers,
they're all dead.

18:37.297 --> 18:39.413
And we're tracking
their killer.

18:39.415 --> 18:40.965
I know.

18:40.967 --> 18:43.084
I had the displeasure
of seeing all that was left

18:43.086 --> 18:47.171
of the real Jack Rollins,
molars and all.

18:47.173 --> 18:50.842
Some twisted mind's
idea of a trophy.

18:50.844 --> 18:53.394
What if the machine sent us
all six numbers to tell us

18:53.396 --> 18:57.148
that someone had been
all of those people?

18:57.150 --> 18:59.317
What if a smart killer
was interested not only

18:59.319 --> 19:03.604
in taking lives,
but in taking identities.

19:03.606 --> 19:05.189
Like a chameleon.

19:05.191 --> 19:07.241
Changing into his victims,
living their lives

19:07.243 --> 19:10.578
until he gets bored
and moves on to the next.

19:10.580 --> 19:13.281
To identify such a killer,
we would want to consider

19:13.283 --> 19:18.152
who he has been,
and what he might look like.

19:22.341 --> 19:24.792
Okay, so how do you
spot someone who's that good

19:24.794 --> 19:26.327
at being anyone else?

19:26.329 --> 19:28.012
Excuse me, Marshal.

19:28.014 --> 19:31.515
That FBI guy needs
to see you out back.

19:39.524 --> 19:41.792
You need to see this.
Stanley put them out.

19:41.794 --> 19:45.062
Someone used diesel
to try to cook the pile.

19:45.064 --> 19:47.114
The killer
was here minutes ago.

19:47.116 --> 19:49.683
He's close.

19:49.685 --> 19:52.987
And he's shed
the "Rollins" identity.

19:58.660 --> 20:01.329
Then he could
be anyone in there.

20:11.570 --> 20:13.770
If the killer
is among these people,

20:13.772 --> 20:16.373
then he's out of his element--
he's broken his pattern.

20:16.375 --> 20:18.675
Assuming the identities
of his victims,

20:18.677 --> 20:20.577
it's part of his ritual.

20:20.579 --> 20:23.647
And now that rollins' ID
is burned, he's trapped.

20:23.649 --> 20:26.283
He must have taken on
another identity.

20:26.285 --> 20:27.834
And he can't
go anywhere with it.

20:27.836 --> 20:29.503
He's as stuck as we are.

20:29.505 --> 20:33.090
Why didn't the machine
give us his real identity?

20:33.092 --> 20:34.708
Why play games?

20:34.710 --> 20:36.009
I assume he's smart,
and he digitally erased

20:36.011 --> 20:37.911
his original persona.

20:37.913 --> 20:39.263
I did.

20:39.265 --> 20:41.581
Well, we need to find
a way to hunt him.

20:41.583 --> 20:44.768
We might be able to,
Mr. Reese.

20:44.770 --> 20:47.354
Are you familiar
with storm chasing?

21:03.371 --> 21:06.423
What are you watching?

21:06.425 --> 21:09.743
Didn't know if you were
still too busy to talk to me.

21:11.429 --> 21:13.747
Actually, I could use another
set of eyes on something.

21:13.749 --> 21:15.766
Take a look.

21:15.768 --> 21:18.402
This is a building-owned
security camera in Chicago

21:18.404 --> 21:19.987
six months ago.

21:19.989 --> 21:23.090
A missing persons I'm working.
Guy named Rollins.

21:23.092 --> 21:25.025
This is him
leaving his shop,

21:25.027 --> 21:27.111
and him coming back
the next day.

21:27.113 --> 21:29.646
Oh, he moved to New York
soon after.

21:29.648 --> 21:32.866
- What do you notice?
- That the same guy both times?

21:32.868 --> 21:34.785
- Why do you ask?
- That's a close match.

21:34.787 --> 21:37.454
But the guy locking up
is left-handed,

21:37.456 --> 21:40.107
and the guy unlocking
is a righty.

21:40.109 --> 21:42.576
He's also a couple
inches taller.

21:42.578 --> 21:45.913
- Exactly.
- What are you looking at here?

21:45.915 --> 21:51.218
- Some kind of elaborate robbery?
- Something much worse.

21:57.559 --> 21:59.726
So let me get this straight.

21:59.728 --> 22:01.562
You want me to conduct
a series of interviews

22:01.564 --> 22:04.515
with everyone on the station
and you want this guy to help?

22:04.517 --> 22:07.184
He's the only one
who arrived on this island

22:07.186 --> 22:09.469
after the bridge went out.

22:09.471 --> 22:11.522
I know he appears
a little strange,

22:11.524 --> 22:13.640
but he does have some
interesting equipment

22:13.642 --> 22:15.159
in those bags.

22:15.161 --> 22:17.077
Yeah, well, unless he
has a fingerprint scanner

22:17.079 --> 22:20.647
and the ViCAP database,
what does he have that we need?

22:20.649 --> 22:22.416
Agent... Fahey, is it?

22:22.418 --> 22:26.603
Are you familiar
with the Instantel seismograph?

22:31.209 --> 22:32.926
Body armor?

22:32.928 --> 22:34.294
I don't think we'll
be taking too much heavy fire

22:34.296 --> 22:36.013
with this group.

22:36.015 --> 22:37.714
Look, Jennings, I spend most
of my nine-to-five

22:37.716 --> 22:39.683
tethered to a desk.

22:39.685 --> 22:43.887
I've questioned a few embezzlers
and some identity thieves.

22:43.889 --> 22:46.190
We're about to walk
into a room with a killer.

22:46.192 --> 22:48.942
And I' be standing
right behind you.

22:52.313 --> 22:54.198
Thank you, Mr. Amis.

22:54.200 --> 22:56.283
I'm with the FBI,
looking for a missing person

22:56.285 --> 22:57.951
on the island here.

22:57.953 --> 22:59.403
I'd like to ask you
a standard series of questions,

22:59.405 --> 23:01.622
and I'd appreciate
your cooperation.

23:01.624 --> 23:06.660
- Okay, so ask.
- This is Jack Rollins.

23:06.662 --> 23:08.695
I'm trying to establish
who had contact with him

23:08.697 --> 23:12.883
on the island recently.

23:12.885 --> 23:14.635
I don't recognize him.

23:14.637 --> 23:16.386
We don't get too many tourists
this time of the year,

23:16.388 --> 23:18.805
but I would have seen him
at the store.

23:18.807 --> 23:21.675
Who do you recognize
at the station tonight, Becky?

23:21.677 --> 23:25.262
I've known Stanley
most of my life.

23:25.264 --> 23:29.266
- Who don't you recognize?
- That honeymoon couple for one.

23:29.268 --> 23:30.734
And where did
you two meet?

23:30.736 --> 23:32.492
- We met in Albany.
- We met in Albany.

23:34.523 --> 23:36.823
Why didn't you
evacuate earlier?

23:36.825 --> 23:39.193
I told you, I've got
a few thousand bucks

23:39.195 --> 23:40.560
crawling around
in those traps

23:40.562 --> 23:42.246
you made me leave down
on the docks.

23:42.248 --> 23:44.231
So you disregarded
a state of emergency?

23:44.233 --> 23:46.083
I had to preserve my catch.

23:46.085 --> 23:48.919
You often pull in traps
all by yourself?

23:48.921 --> 23:52.339
- How's it going?
- Good.

23:52.341 --> 23:54.007
See all these tiny waves?

23:54.009 --> 23:55.442
They're called microseisms,

23:55.444 --> 23:57.477
and all these little bumps
are the heartbeat.

23:57.479 --> 23:59.796
The needle picks it up
like it would a tectonic shift,

23:59.798 --> 24:01.465
and it's picking up a lot.

24:01.467 --> 24:04.184
- And everyone else?
- I'm getting clean readings.

24:04.186 --> 24:06.419
The metal in the table
amplifies it.

24:06.421 --> 24:07.938
Everyone is steady.

24:07.940 --> 24:10.274
Stanley the bar owner
is a little below average,

24:10.276 --> 24:11.975
but I think there might
be something wrong with him.

24:11.977 --> 24:14.861
No, I just think
his blood alcohol level

24:14.863 --> 24:16.730
could start a lawn mower.

24:16.732 --> 24:20.934
- But that fisherman in there?
- He's nervous about something.

24:23.238 --> 24:24.738
I know Ethan Mattson.

24:24.740 --> 24:26.990
He's lived on Owen
for five years.

24:26.992 --> 24:31.545
He gets into some trouble,
but he's good on the boats.

24:31.547 --> 24:34.715
Do you wanna know
who I don't recognize?

24:34.717 --> 24:36.717
Half of Owen knows
Cunningham Properties,

24:36.719 --> 24:39.786
but I can't say I've ever
said "hi" to his face.

24:39.788 --> 24:41.838
And that drifter?

24:41.840 --> 24:44.124
I mean, who comes
to an island in winter

24:44.126 --> 24:47.961
looking for seasonal work?

24:56.470 --> 24:58.188
Ms. Winter, how long
have you been the Dean

24:58.190 --> 25:00.607
of Student Affairs
at Stanford?

25:00.609 --> 25:03.110
10-- no, 11 years.

25:03.112 --> 25:04.644
I'm wondering
if you could shed light

25:04.646 --> 25:07.197
on a former student
who went missing.

25:07.199 --> 25:09.116
Henri Musset?
He graduated--

25:09.118 --> 25:13.086
In 2005. I remember Henri.
He was an international student.

25:13.088 --> 25:15.488
He went missing
right after he graduated.

25:15.490 --> 25:17.124
Police called for weeks.

25:17.126 --> 25:19.176
Inspectors from France,
even Interpol.

25:19.178 --> 25:21.712
There was a digital trail
on the boy in San Diego,

25:21.714 --> 25:23.347
18 months after graduating.

25:23.349 --> 25:25.215
Just as we told
the authorities then,

25:25.217 --> 25:27.417
Henri never left
a forwarding address.

25:27.419 --> 25:29.469
We often lose touch
with recent alumni until

25:29.471 --> 25:31.104
they settle down somewhere.

25:31.106 --> 25:33.724
So the last time Henri
was seen was on campus.

25:33.726 --> 25:37.010
He lived in student housing.
Did he have a roommate?

25:39.948 --> 25:44.067
Yes. His last year, it was
a student named Alex Declan.

25:44.069 --> 25:46.787
It says here-- huh.

25:46.789 --> 25:48.288
What?

25:48.290 --> 25:51.358
I just see a note
on Henri's housing form.

25:51.360 --> 25:53.744
He requested a new roommate
his last semester.

25:53.746 --> 25:55.879
The last semester
of his senior year?

25:55.881 --> 25:58.198
- Does that happen often?
- Not usually.

25:58.200 --> 26:00.867
Most seniors have a million
other things on their mind.

26:00.869 --> 26:03.703
But the matter seems
to have been resolved.

26:03.705 --> 26:05.972
Do you have
any records on Declan?

26:08.844 --> 26:10.811
That's strange.

26:10.813 --> 26:13.730
Declan is listed in housing
as Henri's roommate,

26:13.732 --> 26:16.350
but I can't find
his registration.

26:16.352 --> 26:20.103
No student photo either.

26:20.105 --> 26:24.191
Something must have
fallen through the cracks.

26:26.277 --> 26:28.578
Dennis, you're
such a busy guy.

26:28.580 --> 26:30.730
You don't get out
to the island very often.

26:30.732 --> 26:32.732
I don't babysit
my properties.

26:32.734 --> 26:35.702
But the hotel out here
was days behind schedule.

26:35.704 --> 26:39.906
You think I want to slog around
this sandpit in the rain?

26:41.342 --> 26:44.461
Victor,
you don't have an ID.

26:44.463 --> 26:46.763
You don't have a solid alibi
for being here on the island

26:46.765 --> 26:48.682
and, last of all,
for being down at the boatyard.

26:48.684 --> 26:51.601
I told you.
I was passing through.

26:57.942 --> 27:00.610
Recognize this?
It's yours.

27:03.281 --> 27:04.865
You've got
a lot of D-rings.

27:04.867 --> 27:06.616
Kind of weird.

27:06.618 --> 27:10.070
Unless you're
a climber, or...

27:10.072 --> 27:13.707
in the military.

27:20.999 --> 27:25.552
Do you have
a heart problem?

27:25.554 --> 27:29.423
Because right now,
yours is really pumping.

27:32.143 --> 27:34.644
Owen Island Station,
this is Detective Joss Carter.

27:34.646 --> 27:36.229
Eighth Precinct,
New York City,

27:36.231 --> 27:38.098
calling on the emergency
police frequency.

27:38.100 --> 27:40.183
Do you read me?
Over.

27:40.185 --> 27:42.519
This is Deputy Schmidt
of the Owen Island PD.

27:42.521 --> 27:43.737
Who is this?

27:43.739 --> 27:45.638
Detective Carter

27:45.640 --> 27:47.407
from New York City.

27:47.409 --> 27:48.658
I have new information

27:48.660 --> 27:49.943
for the US Marshal
on your island.

27:49.945 --> 27:52.112
I need to speak
to him immediately.

27:52.114 --> 27:53.980
Who is it?

27:53.982 --> 27:55.749
Some detective from the city
got through,

27:55.751 --> 27:57.484
said her name
was Carpenter-- Carter--

27:57.486 --> 28:00.253
Ugh! The generator.

28:00.255 --> 28:03.423
Do you read me?
Over.

28:39.694 --> 28:43.713
Oh, my God.
Is she-- is she dead?

29:06.568 --> 29:09.118
You shouldn't go out there.
The storm's pretty bad.

29:09.120 --> 29:11.037
I'm following up on a lead,
it's urgent.

29:11.039 --> 29:13.540
- I need to get to Owen Island.
- Whoa, yo, I can't let you do that.

29:13.542 --> 29:16.075
- I don't care what lead it is.
- I'm going, Kyle.

29:16.077 --> 29:17.377
I won't say it again.

29:17.379 --> 29:20.630
Okay... but I'm driving.

29:24.585 --> 29:25.802
What's going on here?

29:25.804 --> 29:27.854
First you question us,
and now this?

29:27.856 --> 29:29.789
You.
You were helping them.

29:29.791 --> 29:31.724
What were they doing
in there, really?

29:31.726 --> 29:33.927
They asked to use my equipment
for police business.

29:33.929 --> 29:35.895
They were looking
for liars in the group.

29:35.897 --> 29:38.498
Talking about
finding a killer.

29:38.500 --> 29:39.932
Becky, what did
they ask you?

29:39.934 --> 29:41.951
They asked me
who I recognized here.

29:41.953 --> 29:45.538
- So who don't you recognize?
- Everyone please settle down.

29:45.540 --> 29:47.540
You're building a hotel
on the other side of the island.

29:47.542 --> 29:49.208
Nobody even
knows your face.

29:49.210 --> 29:50.710
I have hundreds of business
contacts in the city.

29:50.712 --> 29:52.111
Call any of them.

29:52.113 --> 29:53.880
And what good did
that do, Harold?

29:53.882 --> 29:56.583
Behavior analysis, John.
Just give it a minute.

29:56.585 --> 29:59.419
What about you, Mr. Newlywed?
Nobody knows your face.

29:59.421 --> 30:01.254
Wait a second,
I know his face.

30:01.256 --> 30:03.222
Everybody, we're forgetting,
she was killed with a knife.

30:03.224 --> 30:07.894
- So whose knife was it?
- I know whose it is.

30:07.896 --> 30:09.896
That knife?
It's called a Ka-Bar.

30:09.898 --> 30:11.297
Not exactly something
you pick up

30:11.299 --> 30:15.852
at a local
bait and tackle.

30:20.991 --> 30:22.909
I didn't hurt anybody.

30:22.911 --> 30:24.611
You need to be
a special kind of person

30:24.613 --> 30:27.647
to carry a weapon like that.

30:33.754 --> 30:36.623
Let me go.

30:44.498 --> 30:47.717
That's what I thought.

30:49.670 --> 30:51.671
I was lying.

30:51.673 --> 30:54.691
Okay?

30:54.693 --> 30:57.843
God help me, I was lying.
But I'm not a killer.

30:57.845 --> 31:00.563
No. You're a Marine.

31:00.565 --> 31:03.483
The knife.
The tattoo.

31:03.485 --> 31:05.917
The D-rings clipped
to your bag.

31:07.539 --> 31:09.305
You're on the run.

31:11.909 --> 31:15.361
24th Meu
out of Camp Lejeune.

31:15.363 --> 31:17.664
Second tour.

31:17.666 --> 31:19.582
I couldn't go back.

31:19.584 --> 31:21.384
I wanted to get
a boat to Canada.

31:21.386 --> 31:22.752
I got stuck here.

31:22.754 --> 31:24.837
So who else knew
you had that knife?

31:24.839 --> 31:26.339
I don't know.

31:26.341 --> 31:29.759
I mean, I came into the station
with the fisherman.

31:29.761 --> 31:33.396
Wait, where
is the fisherman?

31:33.398 --> 31:36.432
- He must have slipped out.
- I'll go after him.

31:36.434 --> 31:41.404
If I don't come back,
get these people to safety.

32:06.413 --> 32:07.964
So...

32:07.966 --> 32:09.882
do you think we can cross
the entire state

32:09.884 --> 32:12.454
before you say
a word to me?

32:15.106 --> 32:16.723
What do you
want to talk about?

32:16.725 --> 32:19.525
I can think
of some things.

32:19.527 --> 32:22.762
Like how an NYPD detective
got aced out of the FBI

32:22.764 --> 32:25.481
because she keeps bad company,
how about that?

32:25.483 --> 32:27.200
What are you
talking about, the FBI?

32:27.202 --> 32:30.845
Not a friend
of Internal Affairs, huh, Cal?

32:31.105 --> 32:32.989
Joss, I'm in Narcotics.

32:32.991 --> 32:35.625
We get pulled in by IAB
half-a-dozen times a year.

32:35.627 --> 32:37.276
My neck of the woods
don't mean a thing.

32:37.278 --> 32:39.879
It does to me.

32:39.881 --> 32:42.298
Makes me wonder
about the man I trusted.

32:42.300 --> 32:43.616
Oh, what,
you don't trust me?

32:45.203 --> 32:47.453
You think I'm dirty?
That I'm on the take?

32:47.455 --> 32:48.721
Is that what you think?

32:48.723 --> 32:50.139
I don't know
what to think, Cal.

32:50.141 --> 32:51.957
Yo, what did they
tell you about me?

32:55.647 --> 32:57.764
Beecher! Slow down!

33:05.989 --> 33:07.973
You serious?

33:07.975 --> 33:09.776
What, you think
I'd hurt you?

33:09.778 --> 33:12.278
I don't know.

33:12.280 --> 33:14.513
But I don't
want to hurt you.

33:40.440 --> 33:42.191
Marijuana.

33:42.193 --> 33:45.194
This is what you were trying
to protect from the storm.

34:00.360 --> 34:03.296
Unh! Unh!

34:03.298 --> 34:04.697
Huh.

34:17.811 --> 34:19.960
Oh, no, that couldn't be.

34:22.100 --> 34:23.599
Unbelievable.

34:23.601 --> 34:26.735
We're hunting a killer,
and instead we get

34:26.737 --> 34:29.021
amateur drug night
in the sticks.

34:30.942 --> 34:33.726
You smuggle it in
on your boat?

34:33.728 --> 34:37.496
Ah, don't say anything.
Just bleed if I'm right.

34:37.498 --> 34:42.501
Ordinarily, I'd make sure
you went behind bars.

34:42.503 --> 34:44.837
But I got bigger
fish to fry.

34:44.839 --> 34:47.014
So you go
in the trunk.

34:54.715 --> 34:56.264
FBI.

35:23.794 --> 35:26.846
What gave me away?

35:40.286 --> 35:43.204
How did you know?

35:43.206 --> 35:46.824
The needle spiked
in between the interviews.

35:46.826 --> 35:48.075
When I wasn't watching.

35:48.077 --> 35:50.628
When you were resting
on the table.

35:50.630 --> 35:53.831
You should keep an eye
on that heart rate.

35:53.833 --> 35:57.385
I knew you were too good
at those interrogations.

35:57.387 --> 35:59.720
Who are you really?

35:59.722 --> 36:03.491
I could ask you
the same thing.

36:03.493 --> 36:06.127
You're taller than
I would have thought.

36:06.129 --> 36:07.845
And you cut your hair.

36:07.847 --> 36:11.899
And you bought every minute
of the dedicated "Agent Fahey."

36:11.901 --> 36:14.134
Yes, quite the performance.

36:14.136 --> 36:18.089
Make a sound,
I start hurting innocents.

36:18.091 --> 36:20.975
Let's take a walk.

36:27.616 --> 36:31.586
I thought a bit more privacy
would do us some good.

36:31.588 --> 36:34.455
You know, the walls
are closing in.

36:34.457 --> 36:37.157
You have no place to run.
It's over.

36:37.159 --> 36:41.546
It's over for Fahey, sure.

36:41.548 --> 36:44.131
Just like it was
over for Rollins.

36:44.133 --> 36:46.934
Was that before or after
you tore teeth out of his head

36:46.936 --> 36:49.503
and threw them
in a furnace?

36:49.505 --> 36:52.557
Damn things never burn.
Sloppy, I know.

36:52.559 --> 36:54.025
But when the FBI's knocking
on your door,

36:54.027 --> 36:56.060
you have to move faster
than you should.

36:56.062 --> 36:59.113
Other agents
will come looking.

36:59.115 --> 37:01.365
Like the last one?

37:01.367 --> 37:03.317
Federal agents
always work in pairs.

37:03.319 --> 37:07.405
But this hard-ass showed up solo
in a stupid blue windbreaker,

37:07.407 --> 37:11.360
knocking on my door,
looking for Rollins.

37:12.528 --> 37:14.328
He talked to me.

37:14.330 --> 37:16.130
Seemed nervous.

37:16.132 --> 37:18.132
A little out
of his element.

37:18.134 --> 37:20.918
Right then I knew
I had him beat.

37:20.920 --> 37:24.705
He left me no choice.
I had to kill him.

37:24.707 --> 37:26.373
Then I realized
my only way off this island

37:26.375 --> 37:28.392
was to become him.

37:28.394 --> 37:31.211
Then this damn storm hits,
and some cowboy US Marshal

37:31.213 --> 37:32.430
comes knocking.

37:32.432 --> 37:34.932
I was stuck
as Special Agent Fahey,

37:34.934 --> 37:36.517
so I improvised.

37:36.519 --> 37:38.603
And the deputy.
Why harm her?

37:38.605 --> 37:40.271
Well, I couldn't be sure
what she heard off the radio.

37:40.273 --> 37:43.574
You always have
to be ready to improvise.

37:50.782 --> 37:54.902
Honestly, the question
isn't who I am.

38:00.876 --> 38:04.128
It's who you are.

38:04.130 --> 38:07.014
I watched you all night.

38:07.016 --> 38:09.266
I can always
spot an impostor.

38:09.268 --> 38:11.863
I spotted you.

38:13.272 --> 38:16.396
Are you like me?

38:24.116 --> 38:27.568
You have no idea.

38:27.570 --> 38:30.404
You're an amateur at this.

38:33.125 --> 38:35.776
Not the way
I planned it, man.

38:35.778 --> 38:37.294
I don't hurt people.

38:37.296 --> 38:41.248
And I didn't kill
the FBI guy in that trunk.

38:41.250 --> 38:44.802
But you're in the way,
so you go in the drink.

38:46.089 --> 38:48.055
Don't worry.

38:48.057 --> 38:51.926
As cold as this water is,
it'll be quick.

39:00.068 --> 39:01.435
Hey, Ethan.

39:02.320 --> 39:04.805
Oof! Uhh!

39:04.807 --> 39:08.209
As quick as that?

39:11.479 --> 39:14.281
Now that Fahey won't get far,
I think the mysterious Mr. Gull

39:14.283 --> 39:16.534
might be my next
great challenge.

39:16.536 --> 39:18.536
You'll never
get off the island.

39:18.538 --> 39:22.173
By morning they'll come here
looking for the real Alan Fahey.

39:22.175 --> 39:23.708
And they'll find him...

39:23.710 --> 39:25.509
in the trunk of his car.

39:25.511 --> 39:27.845
And what about you?

39:27.847 --> 39:31.331
And what
about you?

39:31.333 --> 39:34.685
And what about you?

39:34.687 --> 39:36.670
And what about...

39:36.672 --> 39:38.222
you?

39:38.224 --> 39:40.274
You asked the question
and you're the answer.

39:40.276 --> 39:41.525
Your plane.

39:41.527 --> 39:42.943
You're gonna
fly me out of here.

39:42.945 --> 39:45.946
You haven't outlived
your usefulness.

39:45.948 --> 39:50.484
You could never be me
because I save lives.

39:50.486 --> 39:52.570
You take them.

39:52.572 --> 39:54.955
No, I live those lives better
than real people ever could.

39:54.957 --> 39:58.292
I follow them and watch them
waste what they have.

39:58.294 --> 40:01.662
I do those identities justice.

40:01.664 --> 40:03.380
The things I've seen.

40:03.382 --> 40:07.551
The lives I've lived.

40:07.553 --> 40:09.220
One day I'll stop,
when I find the person

40:09.222 --> 40:11.705
I'm meant to be.

40:11.707 --> 40:13.373
What?

40:13.375 --> 40:16.310
People like you don't stop.

40:16.312 --> 40:19.313
You can rationalize it
however you like.

40:19.315 --> 40:22.983
But you hurt people
because you like it.

40:22.985 --> 40:24.485
Because you're sick!

40:24.487 --> 40:28.572
You're maladjusted
and you need help.

40:28.574 --> 40:31.391
On second thought,
maybe I'll find another way

40:31.393 --> 40:35.029
off this island.

40:37.199 --> 40:41.452
I'll miss finding out
more about you.

40:41.454 --> 40:42.903
If there's anything
left to tell,

40:42.905 --> 40:45.339
I'll make it up
as I go along.

40:45.341 --> 40:48.843
Don't worry,
I'm good at that.

40:48.845 --> 40:51.378
Just like you.

40:56.184 --> 40:59.553
- You all right, Harold?
- Detective?

41:05.610 --> 41:08.929
You have impeccable timing.

41:08.931 --> 41:10.281
How did you get here?

41:10.283 --> 41:11.932
I hitched a ride
with the Coast Guard.

41:11.934 --> 41:14.068
And some very unpleasant people
inside said they thought

41:14.070 --> 41:15.903
they saw you
come this way.

41:15.905 --> 41:18.072
So is that him,
our identity killer?

41:18.074 --> 41:20.491
He was pretending
to be an FBI agent.

41:20.493 --> 41:22.660
He was really
rather good at it.

41:22.662 --> 41:24.912
He had a badge
and a gun and a--

41:24.914 --> 41:26.280
And what?

41:26.282 --> 41:28.115
Body armor.

41:53.975 --> 41:56.193
What are you doing?

41:56.195 --> 41:57.912
It's a police station.

41:57.914 --> 42:01.198
There's bound to be one
of these around here somewhere.

42:06.821 --> 42:08.731
Hey, listen...

42:10.543 --> 42:13.928
I don't know what happened
last night between us,

42:13.930 --> 42:17.831
but, uh, I'm wondering
what happens today.

42:21.853 --> 42:24.021
I don't know
what happens.

42:27.559 --> 42:30.240
But I'm glad
you were here.

42:34.399 --> 42:37.785
A drug smuggler shot at me
with a spear gun last night.

42:37.787 --> 42:40.170
Is that a first for you?

42:40.172 --> 42:42.406
Wish I could say yes.

42:42.408 --> 42:44.124
Glad you made it back,
Mr. Reese.

42:44.126 --> 42:46.710
I am too.

42:46.712 --> 42:49.964
And I'm glad
the machine was right.

42:49.966 --> 42:51.715
How so?

42:51.717 --> 42:53.467
It was smart enough
to tell us about a killer

42:53.469 --> 42:55.336
with multiple identities.

42:55.338 --> 42:58.839
It may be true that the six
numbers were not a glitch,

42:58.841 --> 43:02.309
but the three days of silence
preceding it were.

43:02.311 --> 43:04.011
If the machine
had been working properly,

43:04.013 --> 43:06.213
we might have gotten a number
for the real Alan Fahey

43:06.215 --> 43:08.548
and saved him.

43:08.550 --> 43:11.808
Instead, an
BI agent is dead.

43:13.356 --> 43:18.008
I wish I knew what that
means for the future.

43:18.010 --> 43:20.568
At least the storm
is passing.

43:23.064 --> 43:25.199
No, Mr. Reese,
I have a feeling

43:25.201 --> 43:27.854
that it's
just beginning.
