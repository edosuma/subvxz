WEBVTT

00:06.589 --> 00:08.425
[Elsa] Ladies, thank you so much

00:08.508 --> 00:09.801
for helping with this.

00:09.884 --> 00:11.886
That is so nice of you.

00:11.970 --> 00:14.639
I mean, honestly,
it's not even your school.

00:14.723 --> 00:17.851
It's amazing that your school's
doing an autism-friendly dance.

00:17.934 --> 00:21.521
Our school is shit. Literally there was
a shit in the hallway last week.

00:21.604 --> 00:23.023
[laughing]

00:23.106 --> 00:26.192
Well, you are all invited to come
and bring your kids.

00:26.276 --> 00:27.777
You do not want me to bring Addie.

00:27.902 --> 00:29.988
She's in a phase
where she's telling everyone

00:30.071 --> 00:31.823
to stick their head up their ass.

00:31.906 --> 00:34.868
The other day, I got so sick of it,
I hid in the garage for an hour.

00:34.951 --> 00:36.244
Good for you.

00:36.327 --> 00:38.455
Self-care is so important.

00:39.581 --> 00:42.000
What about you, Elsa?
Doing any self-care lately?

00:42.083 --> 00:43.376
Um...

00:48.465 --> 00:50.383
Nope. Same old, same old.

00:50.467 --> 00:52.552
Really? No new hobbies?

00:52.635 --> 00:55.388
Because, honestly, you seem very happy.

00:56.014 --> 00:57.348
What's up, girl?

00:57.432 --> 00:59.768
Are you just naturally that perfect?

00:59.851 --> 01:01.436
No. No, I'm not.

01:01.519 --> 01:04.898
I'm not perfect at all.
In fact, actually, um...

01:06.107 --> 01:08.693
I have sort of taken up a new hobby.

01:08.777 --> 01:09.944
I've been, um...

01:11.571 --> 01:12.405
bowling.

01:15.116 --> 01:16.409
Bowling? Really?

01:16.493 --> 01:17.494
Yeah.

01:17.577 --> 01:19.496
It's crazy. Weird, right?

01:19.579 --> 01:20.789
But it's so much fun.

01:22.707 --> 01:24.876
And I think it's making me a better mom

01:24.959 --> 01:26.085
and a better wife.

01:26.169 --> 01:27.462
Bowling did all that?

01:27.545 --> 01:28.797
Yeah. But, you know,

01:28.880 --> 01:31.633
sometimes I feel so guilty
about bowling

01:31.716 --> 01:33.134
that I want to kill myself.

01:33.218 --> 01:35.637
Oh, no, no, no, no.
You keep bowling, lady.

01:35.720 --> 01:37.013
I am inspired.

01:37.764 --> 01:39.599
I might have to take up bowling myself.

01:40.350 --> 01:43.895
Kathy, you need bowling
more than anyone I've ever met.

01:55.698 --> 01:57.951
[Sam]  When you have a girlfriend,

01:58.034 --> 01:59.994
there are always new rules to learn.

02:00.078 --> 02:01.621
We hold hands in the hall now.

02:01.704 --> 02:03.248
Okay.

02:03.331 --> 02:06.960
I can't believe you're abandoning me
to go to that fancy school.

02:07.836 --> 02:09.295
Who am I gonna be friends with?

02:09.379 --> 02:11.381
-I hate everyone else.
-Dude, calm down.

02:11.464 --> 02:14.134
Admissions is this week,
and I haven't heard anything,

02:14.217 --> 02:15.635
so I'm probably not going,

02:15.718 --> 02:17.971
which means that
I won't be going anywhere...

02:18.471 --> 02:19.973
and my heart will be crushed.

02:20.056 --> 02:21.432
Let's hope so.

02:23.852 --> 02:25.228
-Silent dance?
-Mm-hmm.

02:25.311 --> 02:26.646
What's a silent dance?

02:26.729 --> 02:28.439
It's a much better way to have a dance

02:28.523 --> 02:31.943
where everyone listens to music
on headphones instead of out loud.

02:32.026 --> 02:34.112
Drug kids started it
to have raves in the woods,

02:34.195 --> 02:36.406
but they're great
for people with sensory issues.

02:36.489 --> 02:39.993
Who knew that meth heads and people on
the spectrum had some of the same needs?

02:41.161 --> 02:42.912
Shoot. Was that insensitive to say?

02:42.996 --> 02:43.830
-Yes.
-I don't know.

02:43.913 --> 02:45.999
You organized this whole thing just
for Sam?

02:46.082 --> 02:48.042
-Yeah.
-That's pretty cool, Paige.

02:48.126 --> 02:50.962
Yeah, well, that's what you do
when you're in love.

02:55.049 --> 02:58.720
Sam! Oh! That's the first time
we've said that to each other.

02:58.803 --> 03:00.930
-That's so special.
-I didn't say anything.

03:01.764 --> 03:03.182
-Okay, we're gonna go.
-Bye.

03:03.266 --> 03:04.309
Mm-hmm.

03:04.392 --> 03:06.519
Okay, I know that because of your autism,

03:06.603 --> 03:09.063
you might not know if you love me yet,
and that's totally fine.

03:09.147 --> 03:10.523
[sighs]

03:10.607 --> 03:13.359
But if you could figure it out
by Thursday, that'd be great,

03:13.443 --> 03:15.695
because we're having dinner
with my whole family

03:15.778 --> 03:17.697
and we could break
the news to them then.

03:17.780 --> 03:19.157
[sighs happily]

03:21.868 --> 03:23.202
[Julia]  This isn't about me.

03:23.286 --> 03:24.746
It's about the baby.

03:24.829 --> 03:26.998
I'm tired of leaving you messages.

03:27.081 --> 03:30.126
Obviously, you don't care
about this pregnancy, and that's fine.

03:30.752 --> 03:33.671
I was really upset about it before,
but I can see now that

03:33.755 --> 03:37.550
if you can't be bothered to call back,
well, we're better off without you.

03:38.509 --> 03:39.636
I'm okay with that.

03:40.136 --> 03:42.388
I feel good about it.

03:44.224 --> 03:45.266
Goodbye, Miles.

03:56.611 --> 03:57.987
Ahh!

04:02.617 --> 04:03.451
[sighs]

04:03.534 --> 04:06.329
Buying a home theater system
is a huge deal,

04:06.412 --> 04:08.289
but I'm here for you every step
of the way.

04:08.373 --> 04:10.083
-Paige loves me.
-Got to go.

04:11.042 --> 04:14.837
Love? Dude, this is huge. I love love.

04:14.921 --> 04:17.382
You tell anyone, I'll kill you.
So, what'd you say?

04:17.465 --> 04:20.051
-I didn't know what to say.
-Well, do you love her?

04:20.134 --> 04:23.888
I need to figure it out by Thursday
when I meet her parents at Olive Garden.

04:23.972 --> 04:26.975
Totally. You cannot meet her parents
unless you know it's for real.

04:27.058 --> 04:29.143
'Cause what if you like them?

04:29.227 --> 04:30.561
Next thing you know,

04:30.645 --> 04:32.814
you and her dad will be
going to baseball games,

04:32.897 --> 04:34.357
and he's calling you "Z,"

04:34.440 --> 04:36.693
which is nice 'cause your dad
wasn't around that much.

04:36.776 --> 04:39.112
And then you and Tamra break up,

04:39.195 --> 04:41.656
and Steve won't return your calls.

04:41.739 --> 04:45.159
And then it's like you got dumped twice,
and that really stings.

04:46.786 --> 04:49.914
I'm pretty sure that Paige's dad
is named Mario.

04:49.998 --> 04:51.916
I remember 'cause "Super Mario."

04:52.000 --> 04:56.462
The point is, you can't dive into all this
unless you know you love her back.

04:56.546 --> 04:58.214
But... [sighs]

04:58.298 --> 05:00.300
what about taking the D-Train
to Bone Town?

05:00.383 --> 05:03.177
I have condoms. I've seen boobs.
I'm ready.

05:03.261 --> 05:04.429
I'm sorry.

05:04.971 --> 05:07.265
That train has passed your stop, bro.

05:07.348 --> 05:09.392
You're headed straight for Love Land.

05:09.475 --> 05:12.937
You can still visit Bone Town for sure,
nice day trip, little vacay,

05:13.021 --> 05:16.858
pop in, buy a trinket, but not until you
get this love business squared away.

05:16.941 --> 05:18.276
But... [sighs]

05:18.359 --> 05:20.069
how do I know if I'm in love?

05:21.487 --> 05:22.822
You just know, man.

05:23.656 --> 05:24.657
You just know.

05:28.286 --> 05:29.871
Paige told Sam that she loves him.

05:29.954 --> 05:31.331
-She did?
-Yeah.

05:31.414 --> 05:33.041
-Whoa. That's huge.
-I know.

05:33.124 --> 05:36.919
They've only been dating for like
two seconds. Less time than us.

05:37.003 --> 05:38.212
[chuckles]

05:38.296 --> 05:40.882
Yeah. Okay, then. Yeah.

05:40.965 --> 05:41.924
Yeah.

05:46.304 --> 05:47.138
[door opens]

05:47.221 --> 05:48.598
-Whoa! Mom!
-Hey, you two.

05:48.681 --> 05:51.642
-Can you knock?
-Uh, not on a closed door, I can't.

05:52.393 --> 05:55.897
You know the rule... boy's inside,
nothing to hide. I just made that up.

05:55.980 --> 05:57.231
-That's great.
-[Elsa laughs]

05:57.315 --> 06:00.693
Thank you.
There's snacks downstairs... baby carrots

06:00.777 --> 06:03.821
and something I thought was hummus,
but tastes like vegetables.

06:03.905 --> 06:06.949
Oh, you know, actually, I should...
I should probably get going.

06:07.033 --> 06:09.911
But it was really good to see you,
Mrs. Gardner. And, um...

06:11.370 --> 06:12.747
-Okay.
-[clears throat]

06:14.415 --> 06:15.500
All right.

06:16.626 --> 06:17.627
Bye.

06:18.711 --> 06:20.505
Take a carrot for the road.

06:20.588 --> 06:21.964
[chuckles] Okay, I will.

06:22.048 --> 06:23.674
-Okay. Yeah.
-Okay.

06:27.178 --> 06:29.055
-So...
-Ugh.

06:29.138 --> 06:30.139
Okay.

06:31.933 --> 06:33.518
That looked hot and heavy.

06:33.601 --> 06:34.519
Oh, God.

06:34.602 --> 06:37.105
I'm saying that we've never
really had the "talk."

06:37.188 --> 06:38.481
Mm-hmm.

06:38.564 --> 06:41.776
-Yeah.
-I'm here if you want to launch right in.

06:41.859 --> 06:43.111
-I'm good.
-Or...

06:43.194 --> 06:45.446
I could get a book,
something with diagrams,

06:45.530 --> 06:46.864
like penis drawings and...

06:46.948 --> 06:48.616
Oh, I'm, you know--

06:48.699 --> 06:50.201
Well, if you need me,

06:51.327 --> 06:52.411
I'm here.

06:55.414 --> 06:56.833
Mom?

06:59.085 --> 07:01.629
I don't want to make, like,
a big thing out of it...

07:02.547 --> 07:03.589
but we're not having sex.

07:05.174 --> 07:07.385
I'm not ready, so...

07:09.011 --> 07:10.096
So, yeah, you can go.

07:10.805 --> 07:11.848
Okay.

07:14.434 --> 07:15.601
[door closes]

07:15.685 --> 07:17.186
[exhales]

07:18.312 --> 07:19.897
I just want to say one thing.

07:19.981 --> 07:22.567
I'm really glad you shared that with me.

07:27.905 --> 07:29.657
Because I always wanted a girl,

07:29.740 --> 07:32.368
and I always imagined
we'd share girl stuff.

07:32.452 --> 07:34.328
And you never have with me,

07:35.037 --> 07:37.081
but I feel like we're getting closer now.

07:37.165 --> 07:38.249
Okay.

07:40.543 --> 07:41.836
[door opens]

07:41.919 --> 07:44.964
And I hope that when you are ready
for... [whispers] sex

07:45.047 --> 07:47.091
that you will talk to me
about it then, too,

07:47.175 --> 07:49.260
because it's a big decision...

07:49.343 --> 07:50.344
Okay.

07:50.428 --> 07:54.056
...and it's a big moment in your life
and you need to be thoughtful about it.

07:54.140 --> 07:56.434
-Okay.
-Okay. Goodbye.

07:56.517 --> 07:57.602
I love you.

07:58.644 --> 07:59.854
[sighs]

08:05.234 --> 08:07.737
[Sam]  Learning the rules
for something is important,

08:07.820 --> 08:09.780
but sometimes it feels like,

08:09.864 --> 08:11.324
as soon as you learn the rules,

08:11.949 --> 08:12.950
they change.

08:17.371 --> 08:19.499
Hey, honey, I have a free day tomorrow.

08:19.582 --> 08:22.543
Can I pick you up from school,
and we can go and get ice cream

08:22.627 --> 08:24.003
at Friendly's like we used to?

08:26.714 --> 08:29.717
Nope. I have thinking to do,
so being alone is ideal.

08:35.806 --> 08:38.392
"If you can read this, you suck."

08:39.143 --> 08:40.144
Thank you.

08:42.480 --> 08:43.439
[sighs]

08:59.705 --> 09:01.415
[cheering]

09:09.131 --> 09:10.091
Hey.

09:10.174 --> 09:11.300
Oh, hey.

09:12.009 --> 09:14.720
Oh, God, I'm so glad you're here.

09:14.804 --> 09:16.138
Not in public.

09:17.723 --> 09:19.517
Oh. Sorry.

09:19.600 --> 09:20.601
What is all this?

09:20.685 --> 09:23.187
It's, uh, an impromptu memorial.

09:23.271 --> 09:24.772
I still can't believe it.

09:24.855 --> 09:26.148
Meatball died.

09:26.232 --> 09:30.027
-Meatball is...
-You met Meatball. He worked here.

09:30.778 --> 09:31.654
Right.

09:31.737 --> 09:35.116
So, Meatball was, um...

09:35.199 --> 09:37.243
Big guy, goatee.

09:40.871 --> 09:42.123
-Oh, right.
-Yeah.

09:42.206 --> 09:43.624
Meatball. Yeah.

09:43.708 --> 09:46.043
I never spoke with him,
but he had a kind face.

09:46.127 --> 09:47.503
-Yeah, he did.
-Yeah.

09:47.587 --> 09:49.880
I'm gonna let you go
so you can be with...

09:49.964 --> 09:52.925
Actually, you know, it really
cheers me up, you being here...

09:54.051 --> 09:55.428
if you don't mind staying.

09:56.554 --> 09:57.888
Oh, yeah, right.

09:57.972 --> 09:59.724
No. Sure. Sure.

10:00.850 --> 10:01.726
You're the best.

10:01.809 --> 10:04.020
Well... [chuckles]

10:05.896 --> 10:07.732
Oh, hey.

10:07.815 --> 10:09.358
I'm so sorry.

10:10.359 --> 10:11.402
Come on.

10:23.080 --> 10:24.498
Oh, good. You're here.

10:24.582 --> 10:25.708
Major crisis.

10:25.791 --> 10:27.877
We have lots of smaller decorations,

10:27.960 --> 10:30.504
and we've got snowflake garlands
up the wazoo,

10:30.588 --> 10:33.299
even though I told Beth
to stop making them half an hour ago.

10:33.382 --> 10:37.094
I can't stop. I'm a machine...
a garland-making machine.

10:37.178 --> 10:40.014
Okay, but we're in serious need
of some bigger pieces.

10:40.097 --> 10:42.141
It's a large space in there
and it's just...

10:42.224 --> 10:44.894
[Sam]  Zahid said you just know
when you're in love.

10:44.977 --> 10:46.354
I just don't want...

10:46.437 --> 10:48.105
-But how?
-It would be such a bummer

10:48.189 --> 10:50.900
if people were bored at this dance.
We need something that

10:50.983 --> 10:53.027
we could use as backdrops for photos or...

10:53.110 --> 10:54.654
or hangout nooks.

10:54.737 --> 10:56.364
Nooks are very important.

10:57.114 --> 10:58.741
I can help with that.

10:58.824 --> 10:59.700
You can?

10:59.784 --> 11:03.663
-You want me to build you an igloo?

-I always thought you hated that igloo.
-No.

What exactly is a never-ending pasta bowl?
It must end somewhere.

13:38.192 --> 13:41.362
Can I have noodles with butter?

My Dad calls it "casing the joint,"

13:56.418 --> 13:59.505

to know what to expect.

13:59.588 --> 14:00.464
-Hey.
-Hey.

21:58.483 --> 22:00.027
Not for me.

22:00.110 --> 22:03.447
When I was doing social-skills sessions
in elementary school,

22:03.530 --> 22:06.116
we used a Hula-Hoop
to learn about boundaries

22:06.199 --> 22:08.660
and how people don't like it
when you stand too close.

22:08.744 --> 22:11.788
But I can't slow-dance
with a Hula-Hoop,

22:11.872 --> 22:14.666
so I-I don't know how I'm supposed to know
how close to stand.

22:15.667 --> 22:17.627
Okay. Try this.

22:18.962 --> 22:21.381
Think of personal space
on a scale of one to three.

22:21.465 --> 22:23.383
Three would be with your arms out,

22:23.467 --> 22:26.470
fully extended,
like how you would dance with your sister.

22:27.095 --> 22:29.848
And then you would put your hands
on my shoulders as well.

22:29.931 --> 22:31.433
Oh, okay.

22:32.017 --> 22:35.395
Then you just kind of sway
back and forth.

22:37.814 --> 22:39.900
And we're dancing.

22:39.983 --> 22:41.526
I like three a lot.

22:41.610 --> 22:43.111
Yeah. See?

22:43.195 --> 22:45.697
And I dropped a box
of appliances on my foot,

22:45.781 --> 22:47.282
so it can't be that hard.

22:47.365 --> 22:49.284
Now, Paige is your girlfriend,

22:49.367 --> 22:50.911
so you might want to move to two.

22:50.994 --> 22:51.953
How do I do that?

22:52.037 --> 22:54.956
Well, okay, put your arms down.

22:56.083 --> 23:00.003
Now bend them to a 120-degree angle.

23:01.546 --> 23:02.380
Yeah.

23:02.464 --> 23:04.800
And then you just kind of scooch in.
