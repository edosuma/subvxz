01:10.112 --> 01:12.535
All right now.
Y'all fresh niggers.

01:12.698 --> 01:14.245
Y'all gonna be
in a cutting gang.

01:14.658 --> 01:17.457
Very simple. I want you
to take your knife.

01:17.619 --> 01:19.371
Get in them cane.

01:20.038 --> 01:21.415
Make it sing.

01:21.582 --> 01:23.459
Take the cane out.

01:23.625 --> 01:24.922
Cut my tops.

01:25.085 --> 01:27.213
Clean the shucks off.

01:27.588 --> 01:31.013
Throw it on a pile
for the planting gang.

01:31.300 --> 01:33.769
Now, them cane ain't gonna
jump up and bite you.

01:33.927 --> 01:34.928
Don't shy back.

01:35.095 --> 01:36.938
Rush here, boys! Rush here!

01:40.642 --> 01:41.939

All right, all right,
all right, all right.

07:11.848 --> 07:12.895
Into bed.

07:13.433 --> 07:15.026
Into bed. Thank you
for the music.

07:15.185 --> 07:16.437
Come on.
Ouch.

07:16.603 --> 07:18.230
Get in there.
Come on.

07:19.898 --> 07:21.024
Give me a kiss.

07:24.736 --> 07:25.737
I love you, Margaret.

07:26.613 --> 07:27.614
I love you, too.

07:28.406 --> 07:29.874
Sleep well.

07:31.785 --> 07:33.207
I'll take this.

07:35.956 --> 07:38.425
I don't want to
hear any more noise.

07:49.636 --> 07:52.059
Three weeks and two days.

07:52.222 --> 07:54.395
It is the custom.

07:54.557 --> 07:56.810
I wonder what you
will do without me.

07:57.644 --> 07:59.612
I won't stay idle.

08:01.064 --> 08:03.237
Darling, it's good money.

08:05.318 --> 08:08.572
If only I didn't have to share
your cooking with other people.

08:10.073 --> 08:11.996
You don't.

08:17.330 --> 08:19.924
Be good for your mother.
Okay, Alonzo?

08:21.668 --> 08:23.921
Can I get a kiss, please?
Thank you.

08:24.587 --> 08:25.588
Travel safely.

08:25.755 --> 08:27.177
Stay safely.

08:30.593 --> 08:31.765
Ready?

08:47.246 --> 08:49.087
Devil call his
name, there he is now.

08:49.112 --> 08:50.455
Mr. Northup!

08:50.613 --> 08:53.332
I have two gentlemen whose
acquaintance you should make.

08:53.491 --> 08:55.493
Misters Brown and Hamilton.

08:55.660 --> 08:56.786
Sir.

08:56.953 --> 08:58.796
Mr. Northup,
these two gentlemen...

08:58.955 --> 09:01.378
were inquiring about
distinguished individuals...

09:01.541 --> 09:03.214
and I was just
this very moment...

09:03.376 --> 09:06.550
saying Solomon Northup is an
expert player on the violin.

09:06.713 --> 09:07.885
He was indeed.

09:08.006 --> 09:09.132
Mr. Moon is being
overly gracious.

09:09.299 --> 09:10.676
Well, taking into consideration

09:10.800 --> 09:12.222
his graciousness
and your modesty...

09:12.385 --> 09:15.389
may we trouble you for a moment
of your time to converse, sir?

09:15.555 --> 09:16.807
Of course.

09:17.223 --> 09:18.349
Good day.

09:18.683 --> 09:19.980
<i>A circus?</i>

09:20.143 --> 09:21.286
That is our usual employee.

09:21.311 --> 09:22.858
The company currently
in the city of Washington.

09:23.021 --> 09:24.739
Circus is too
constricting a word...

09:24.898 --> 09:27.401
to describe the talented and
merry band with which we travel.

09:27.567 --> 09:30.491
It is a spectacle unlike
most have ever witnessed.

09:30.653 --> 09:32.326
Creatures from
the darkest Africa

09:32.447 --> 09:34.074
as yet unseen by civilized man.

09:34.365 --> 09:35.662
Acrobats from the Orient...

09:35.825 --> 09:38.845
who contort themselves in the
most confounding manners.

09:38.870 --> 09:40.872
And I myself
in aide of Mr. Brown...

09:41.039 --> 09:42.712
an internationally
renowned practitioner

09:42.832 --> 09:44.550
in the art of prestidigitation.

09:44.709 --> 09:46.086
We are on our way
thither to rejoin

09:46.211 --> 09:47.588
the company having left
for a short time...

09:47.754 --> 09:49.882
to make a small profit from
our own exhibitions.

09:50.048 --> 09:51.728
The reason for our inquiry
with Mr. Moon...

09:51.883 --> 09:53.635
Yes. We had just
a devil of a time

09:53.760 --> 09:55.512
in procuring music
for our entertainments.

09:55.678 --> 09:57.680
Men of true talents are
seemingly in short supply.

09:57.847 --> 09:58.848
Thank you, sir.

09:59.015 --> 10:01.939
If we could persuade you to
accompany us as far as Washington-

10:02.102 --> 10:04.525
We could give you one dollar
for each day's services...

10:04.687 --> 10:07.087
and three dollars for every night
played at our performances.

10:07.190 --> 10:09.084
In addition, we would
provide sufficient pay...

10:09.109 --> 10:12.204
for your return here to
Saratoga, two weeks from today.

10:17.367 --> 10:19.620
Welcome to Washington, Solomon.

10:27.210 --> 10:29.429
Hamilton, you know too much.

10:29.587 --> 10:31.089
Some say not enough.

10:31.548 --> 10:34.973
Solomon, 43 dollars.
All to you.

10:36.094 --> 10:38.062
That is far more
than my wages amount to.

10:38.221 --> 10:39.768
It's been a most
profitable week, sir.

10:39.973 --> 10:41.225
Cheers.
Cheers.

10:41.391 --> 10:42.608
Cheers.

10:47.230 --> 10:48.732
Another.

10:50.275 --> 10:55.281
Gentlemen, your generosity
is extraordinary.

10:55.446 --> 10:57.494
And your talents are undeniable.

10:57.657 --> 10:58.704
Mmm. To Solomon.

10:58.867 --> 11:01.370
Cheers.

11:41.868 --> 11:43.620
Ugh!

11:45.038 --> 11:46.665
It's all right, Solomon.

11:46.831 --> 11:47.957
There's no shame in it.

11:48.124 --> 11:49.546
No shame at all.

12:11.397 --> 12:13.517
Hamilton, we must hurry.

12:14.275 --> 12:15.460
One too many libation.

12:15.485 --> 12:16.836
We're halfway there.

12:33.753 --> 12:35.104
<i>So sorry...</i>

12:36.297 --> 12:38.140
We won't hear it. We won't.

12:38.299 --> 12:40.318
Let him sleep, Hamilton.

12:40.343 --> 12:42.892
Mmm.
A good night's rest.

12:43.429 --> 12:45.147
And tomorrow...

12:46.224 --> 12:48.522
tomorrow you will feel
as well and refreshed

12:48.643 --> 12:50.896
as if the earth were new again.

12:51.062 --> 12:53.815
Hamilton, there's
nothing more we can do for him.

12:55.608 --> 12:57.001
Such is the pity.

13:06.452 --> 13:09.331
Well, boy, how do you feel now?

13:11.666 --> 13:15.591
My name... My name
is Solomon Northup.

13:15.753 --> 13:19.007
I'm a free man. A resident
of Saratoga, New York.

13:19.173 --> 13:21.801
The residence of my wife and
children who are equally free.

13:21.968 --> 13:23.845
And you have no right
whatsoever to detain me.

13:24.012 --> 13:25.389
You're not any free man.

13:25.555 --> 13:26.852
And I promise you...

13:27.015 --> 13:29.188
I promise you upon my liberation

13:29.309 --> 13:31.482
I will have satisfaction
for this wrong.

13:33.146 --> 13:34.614
Resolve this.

13:35.023 --> 13:36.570
Produce your papers.

13:44.490 --> 13:46.242
You're no free man.

13:46.909 --> 13:48.832
And you ain't from Saratoga.

13:49.370 --> 13:51.247
You're from Georgia.

13:54.751 --> 13:56.503
You ain't a free man.

13:58.338 --> 14:02.388
You're nothing but
a Georgia runaway.

14:04.469 --> 14:09.100
You're just a runaway nigger...

14:09.640 --> 14:11.517
from Georgia.

14:42.799 --> 14:44.472
You're a slave!

14:44.967 --> 14:47.612
You're a Georgia slave!

15:04.362 --> 15:06.035
Are you a slave?

15:07.323 --> 15:08.495
No.

16:06.549 --> 16:08.051
Help.

16:09.302 --> 16:11.020
Help me.

16:12.388 --> 16:14.186
Help me!

16:14.849 --> 16:17.227
Somebody help me!

16:17.935 --> 16:20.063
Help!

16:21.856 --> 16:23.358
Help!

16:35.077 --> 16:37.876
That old thing of yours
is just rags and tatters.

16:38.039 --> 16:40.508
You need something
proper to wear.

16:43.586 --> 16:45.884
Go on, put it on.

17:05.233 --> 17:06.576
There.

17:09.904 --> 17:11.326
That's fine.

17:11.781 --> 17:13.704
That's fine.

17:15.952 --> 17:17.078
Got no gratitude?

17:22.500 --> 17:23.501
No. That's from my wife.

17:23.667 --> 17:25.214
Rags and tatters.

17:25.461 --> 17:27.884
Rags and tatters.

17:37.890 --> 17:39.642
Go on, wash up.

17:42.520 --> 17:44.363
The boy, too.
Get him clean.

17:47.024 --> 17:48.401
Scrub now.

17:48.568 --> 17:50.741
Do you know when
my mama will come?

17:51.237 --> 17:52.296
Hush him up!

17:52.321 --> 17:53.322
Mama! Mama!

17:53.489 --> 17:54.490
Quiet.

17:54.782 --> 17:56.125
Quiet, please.
Mama!

17:56.284 --> 17:57.410
Hush him up!

17:57.577 --> 18:00.956
Your mother will come, I swear she will.
But you must be silent.

18:01.539 --> 18:03.007
Be silent.

18:10.089 --> 18:11.607
We need a sympathetic ear.

18:12.717 --> 18:14.469
An opportunity to
explain our situation.

18:14.635 --> 18:16.637
Who, in your estimation,
is that sympathetic ear?

18:16.804 --> 18:18.522
The two men I journeyed with.

18:18.681 --> 18:20.558
I'm certain they're making
enquiries at this very moment.

18:20.725 --> 18:22.068
I'd be just as
certain they're counting

18:22.184 --> 18:23.527
the money paid for delivering
you to this place.

18:23.686 --> 18:26.735
They were not kidnappers, they
were artists. Fellow performers.

18:26.897 --> 18:28.365
You know that?

18:28.524 --> 18:30.526
You know for certain
who they were?

18:32.194 --> 18:36.370
The reality to come is us
being transported southward.

18:36.532 --> 18:38.626
New Orleans,
if I was to venture.

18:39.368 --> 18:41.746
After we arrive,
we'll be put to market.

18:41.912 --> 18:43.539
And beyond that...

18:44.415 --> 18:46.935
Well, I suppose once in a slave
state, there's only one outcome.

18:47.043 --> 18:47.714
No.

18:47.877 --> 18:49.877
I don't say that to give
you empty agitation, John.

18:49.879 --> 18:51.631
For y'all, there ain't
nothing but that.

18:51.797 --> 18:53.265
But John wasn't kidnapped.

18:53.424 --> 18:55.847
John's just being held
as debt, that's all.

18:56.010 --> 18:57.933
Master pay his debt
and John be redeemed.

18:58.095 --> 18:59.575
Boy, our masters
will not come for us.

18:59.722 --> 19:01.724
John is sorry for y'all,
but that's how it be.

19:01.891 --> 19:03.734
Where you're going,
you're going without John.

19:05.770 --> 19:07.113
Mama!
Randall!

19:08.606 --> 19:09.858
Mama!

19:11.609 --> 19:13.407
Are you all right?

19:14.028 --> 19:15.450
Are you all right?

19:17.281 --> 19:18.703
Thank you, God.

19:20.534 --> 19:22.411
Come on. Get up.

19:22.745 --> 19:24.292
- I said, get up!
- No, don't...

19:24.455 --> 19:26.378
I don't want to hear you talk!
Get in the yard.

19:26.540 --> 19:27.587
Not my children!

19:27.750 --> 19:31.095
Ain't no need for all that. Just
taking a little trip, that's all.

19:31.754 --> 19:33.347
Don't want to
frighten the children

19:33.464 --> 19:35.091
over a little boat ride, do you?

19:35.257 --> 19:36.930
John's master
gonna pay his debt.

19:37.093 --> 19:38.094
Line up!

19:38.219 --> 19:39.445
His master gonna pay his debt!

19:45.267 --> 19:47.941
I don't want to hear a word
out of none of you!

19:48.938 --> 19:50.281
Not a one.

20:03.411 --> 20:04.879
All right, come on.

20:06.414 --> 20:08.291
Move.
Come on.

20:09.875 --> 20:11.377
Come on, child.
Come on.

20:11.544 --> 20:13.046
Follow your mama.

20:13.212 --> 20:14.271
Come on, boy.

20:14.296 --> 20:15.356
Up these stairs.

20:15.381 --> 20:17.634
Get down out
of that wagon. Come on.

20:18.259 --> 20:19.636
Come on. Move it!

20:20.136 --> 20:21.479
Let's go!

20:21.637 --> 20:22.980
Up, up, up the stairs.

20:24.223 --> 20:25.770
Come on, let's go.

20:30.271 --> 20:31.773
Come on, move it!

20:32.064 --> 20:33.691
All right, come on.

20:35.568 --> 20:37.741
Hey, you.
Get up.

20:38.070 --> 20:39.822
Sit down, right there.

20:42.324 --> 20:43.166
Come on.

20:44.910 --> 20:46.583
Right there. Just sit down.

21:22.865 --> 21:25.084
Cheer up and
don't be so cast down.

21:35.127 --> 21:39.428
If you want to survive, do and
say as little as possible.

21:40.758 --> 21:45.138
Tell no one who you really are and
tell no one you can read and write.

21:47.223 --> 21:50.242
Unless you want to
be a dead nigger.

22:05.741 --> 22:07.334
Now keep your mouth shut.

22:15.084 --> 22:16.927
I say we fight.

22:17.920 --> 22:19.422
The crew is fairly small.

22:20.256 --> 22:22.608
Were it well planned, I believe
they could be strong-armed.

22:22.633 --> 22:24.510
Three can't go
against the whole crew.

22:25.636 --> 22:27.638
The rest here are niggers.

22:27.972 --> 22:29.349
Born and bred slaves.

22:29.515 --> 22:31.768
Niggers ain't got
no stomach for a fight.

22:31.934 --> 22:33.277
Not a damn one.

22:33.435 --> 22:37.235
All's I know, if we get
where we're traveling...

22:37.648 --> 22:39.070
we'll wish we'd died trying.

22:39.233 --> 22:41.702
Survival's not
about certain death,

22:41.819 --> 22:44.322
it's about
keeping your head down.

22:47.283 --> 22:50.127
Days ago,
I was with my family...

22:51.662 --> 22:53.460
in my home.

22:54.999 --> 22:57.343
Now you tell me all is lost.

22:59.461 --> 23:02.681
"Tell no one who I am."
That's the way to survive?

23:05.926 --> 23:07.974
Well, I don't want to survive.

23:09.513 --> 23:12.642
I want to live.

24:41.397 --> 24:43.070
Better off.

24:44.024 --> 24:45.571
Better than us.

25:02.584 --> 25:03.836
I don't see him.

25:04.003 --> 25:04.720
Clemens!

25:05.170 --> 25:06.717
Clemens Ray!
Master.

25:06.880 --> 25:08.097
Clemens!
Master Ray, sir!

25:08.257 --> 25:09.509
Master Ray!

25:09.675 --> 25:10.796
Who's in charge here?

25:10.926 --> 25:11.927
I'm the captain!

25:12.094 --> 25:13.266
I'm Mr. Jonus Ray.

25:13.429 --> 25:15.022
My solicitor has
documentation...

25:15.180 --> 25:17.933
verifying the negro known as
Clemens Ray is my property.

25:18.100 --> 25:20.444
I know nothing of
this arrangement.

25:20.602 --> 25:22.454
You are ordered to
return that property

25:22.479 --> 25:24.231
immediately or be
charged with thievery.

25:25.441 --> 25:26.693
Free him!

25:29.611 --> 25:30.737
Master.

25:30.904 --> 25:32.702
Master Ray, sir.

25:34.116 --> 25:35.083
Clemens!

25:35.242 --> 25:36.442
- Clemens!
- Get him back!

25:36.577 --> 25:37.954
Clemens!

25:38.620 --> 25:39.621
Clemens!

25:40.539 --> 25:41.381
Clemens!

26:47.689 --> 26:49.083
Mr. Parker.

26:49.108 --> 26:52.408
Ah, Mr. Northup.
Mrs. Northup.

26:52.653 --> 26:54.701
Solomon, could I interest
you in a new cravat?

26:54.863 --> 26:56.173
Pure silk, by way of the French.

26:56.198 --> 26:58.872
We're in need of a fresh
carryall for my Mrs.'s travels.

26:59.034 --> 26:59.876
Nothing more.

27:00.035 --> 27:01.708
The year has passed already.

27:01.870 --> 27:03.180
Off to work at Sandy Hill again?

27:03.205 --> 27:04.047
I am.

27:04.206 --> 27:05.549
I have just the thing.

27:05.707 --> 27:07.380
Something to suit your style...

27:07.543 --> 27:10.012
and yet sturdy enough
for the 40-mile round trip.

27:10.170 --> 27:11.171
It's beautiful.

27:11.338 --> 27:12.260
At what price?

27:12.381 --> 27:13.348
We will take it.

27:13.507 --> 27:16.636
Children, come see what you
father has just purchased for me.

27:16.802 --> 27:18.363
One moment, sir,
and you'll be assisted.

27:18.470 --> 27:20.188
Mr. Parker.
Sir?

27:20.347 --> 27:21.564
If we could discuss the price.

27:21.723 --> 27:23.350
Oh, forgive me, Solomon.
Forgive me, Mrs. Northup.

27:23.517 --> 27:25.565
A customer waits.
Welcome, sir.

27:25.727 --> 27:27.570
Shop well, sir,
but mind your wallet.

27:27.729 --> 27:29.530
Pay no attention
to this gentleman's nonsense.

27:29.648 --> 27:30.740
Jasper!

27:32.234 --> 27:34.032
My regrets for
the intrusion, sir.

27:34.403 --> 27:36.076
No intrusion.

27:39.908 --> 27:41.376
Good day, sir.

27:41.869 --> 27:43.041
Good day.

27:43.203 --> 27:44.921
Jasper, out.

27:53.088 --> 27:55.341
Very good. Very good.

27:55.716 --> 27:58.265
Let's see, here. Eliza!

27:59.595 --> 28:01.893
Stand up when you
hear your name. Eliza.

28:02.764 --> 28:03.606
Lethe!

28:07.019 --> 28:07.690
John.

28:09.438 --> 28:10.690
Oren.

28:11.940 --> 28:13.112
Platt.

28:16.028 --> 28:17.120
Platt.

28:20.240 --> 28:21.742
Stand up.

28:23.702 --> 28:25.124
You fit the description given.

28:25.287 --> 28:26.630
Why didn't you
answer when called?

28:26.788 --> 28:28.040
My name is not Platt.

28:28.207 --> 28:29.049
My name...

28:31.376 --> 28:33.094
Your name is Platt.

28:35.297 --> 28:37.470
Captain, get these niggers
to my cart.

28:50.145 --> 28:51.317
Mmm.

28:59.613 --> 29:00.830
Move.

29:04.418 --> 29:06.178
I believe I have
something very much

29:06.203 --> 29:07.796
to your liking in the back room.

29:07.955 --> 29:09.673
Follow me, please.

29:09.831 --> 29:12.675
Yes. Now, inspect them
at your leisure...

29:12.834 --> 29:17.681
but I ask you to pay particular
regard to young Ezra here.

29:17.839 --> 29:19.091
Incredibly sound limbs.

29:19.258 --> 29:21.352
I have never seen anything
quite like him.

29:21.510 --> 29:24.354
And this marvelous creature.
Can you believe it? Mmm?

29:24.513 --> 29:26.186
She'll make a fine lady's maid.

29:26.348 --> 29:27.520
Madam?

29:27.849 --> 29:29.522
So, inspect at your leisure.

29:29.685 --> 29:31.983
Take your time.
Help yourself to refreshments.

29:32.145 --> 29:35.149
Gentlemen, what catches
your fancy here? Hmm?

29:35.649 --> 29:36.650
This boy? Yes?

29:36.817 --> 29:38.990
Open your mouth.
Open wider.

29:39.152 --> 29:41.530
Look in there. Never been
sick a day in his life.

29:41.697 --> 29:43.340
And I call particular
attention to Martha.

29:43.365 --> 29:45.834
She is an excellent pastry cook.

29:45.993 --> 29:47.711
Ah, Mr. Ford.

29:48.161 --> 29:50.459
Splendid seeing you, sir.
What catches your fancy?

29:50.622 --> 29:52.670
This lad? He's very brawny.

29:52.833 --> 29:55.644
How much for
the ones Platt and Eliza?

29:55.669 --> 29:57.216
Ah, yes.

29:57.629 --> 29:59.856
A thousand for Platt.
Uh... Oh.

29:59.881 --> 30:02.680
This is a nigger of considerable
talent, I assure you.

30:02.843 --> 30:04.561
700 for Eliza.

30:04.720 --> 30:06.393
My fairest price.

30:06.722 --> 30:07.894
Mmm.

30:08.724 --> 30:09.896
You will accept a note?

30:10.058 --> 30:12.652
Please, sir.
Do not divide my family.

30:12.811 --> 30:14.063
Do not take me unless
you take my children.

30:14.229 --> 30:15.230
Eliza! Quiet!

30:15.397 --> 30:17.117
You will have the most
faithful slave in me.

30:17.274 --> 30:18.617
The most faithful slave
that has ever lived.

30:18.775 --> 30:19.901
But I beg that you
do not separate us.

30:20.027 --> 30:21.074
Your price for the boy?

30:21.236 --> 30:22.579
Eliza! Stop it!

30:22.738 --> 30:23.910
I will give you
something to cry about.

30:24.072 --> 30:26.245
Randall, come forward.
Come, come, come.

30:26.408 --> 30:28.627
Now, do you see
how fit this boy is?

30:28.785 --> 30:30.037
Like ripe fruit.

30:30.203 --> 30:33.082
May I take your stick a moment?
Observe this.

30:33.248 --> 30:35.250
Randall, jump, jump, jump.
Run, run, run.

30:35.417 --> 30:37.590
Very good! Higher.

30:37.753 --> 30:38.879
Now, you see this.

30:39.046 --> 30:42.641
It's very likely he will
grow into a fine beast.

30:43.884 --> 30:45.602
600 for the boy.

30:45.761 --> 30:47.263
Fair and final.

30:47.888 --> 30:49.105
Done.

30:49.264 --> 30:51.608
Superb. A moment, please.

30:51.767 --> 30:53.064
Mr. Ford.

30:53.268 --> 30:54.440
Please.
Eliza!

30:54.603 --> 30:56.413
How much for the little girl?

30:56.438 --> 30:57.530
Ah...

30:57.939 --> 30:59.111
You have no use for her.

30:59.274 --> 31:00.947
One so young will
bring you no profit.

31:01.109 --> 31:02.952
No, no, no.
I cannot sell the girl.

31:03.111 --> 31:06.741
No, there's heaps and piles
of money to be made from her.

31:06.907 --> 31:09.205
She's a beauty.
One of the regular bloods.

31:09.368 --> 31:12.168
None of your thick-lipped, bullet-heated,
cotton-picking niggers, here.

31:12.287 --> 31:14.961
Her child, man.

31:15.374 --> 31:16.125
Please.

31:16.291 --> 31:18.371
For God's sake, are you not
sentimental in the least?

31:18.377 --> 31:21.130
My sentimentality extends
the length of a coin.

31:21.296 --> 31:22.798
God, please.

31:23.340 --> 31:26.719
Now do you take this lot,
Mr. Ford, or do you pass on them?

31:26.885 --> 31:30.480
Please, please.
Please.

31:30.639 --> 31:32.186
I will take
the ones Platt and Eliza.

31:32.349 --> 31:33.350
Sold, Eliza and Platt.

31:33.517 --> 31:34.643
I will not go
without my children!

31:34.768 --> 31:35.860
Goddamn sniveling wench!

31:36.019 --> 31:37.287
You will not take them from me!

31:37.312 --> 31:40.031
God damn you! Get her out of here, Cape!

31:40.190 --> 31:41.908
Please! No! No!

31:42.067 --> 31:43.694
Get her out of here,
god damn it!

31:43.860 --> 31:46.830
Platt, get your fiddle.
Play, play, play something.

31:46.988 --> 31:50.083
I will give you something to cry
about, you goddamned witch!

31:50.242 --> 31:52.415
Get her out of here, Cape!
Out, now!

31:52.661 --> 31:56.040
Mama! Mama! Mama!

31:56.915 --> 31:58.963
Yes.

31:59.126 --> 32:01.845
Mr. Ford, a pleasure.

32:18.395 --> 32:20.693
Did you bring all those niggers?

32:20.856 --> 32:23.109
Two of them?
You got two?

32:23.525 --> 32:24.822
Mr. Chapin.

32:25.444 --> 32:27.913
This one's crying.
Why is this one crying?

32:28.071 --> 32:29.698
Separated from her children.

32:29.865 --> 32:31.287
Oh, clear.
It couldn't be helped.

32:31.450 --> 32:32.702
Poor, poor woman.

32:32.868 --> 32:34.120
Mr. Chapin.
Yes, sir.

32:34.286 --> 32:35.754
Tomorrow, you have
to take these two

32:35.871 --> 32:37.373
up to the mill and
start them working.

32:37.539 --> 32:38.756
For now, make them adequate.

32:38.915 --> 32:40.716
Fix them a meal and have
them rest themselves.

32:40.876 --> 32:42.048
Yes, sir.

32:42.961 --> 32:44.178
Come on, now.

32:44.713 --> 32:46.886
Come on! Don't dawdle!

32:47.174 --> 32:49.802
Something to eat, and some rest.

32:49.968 --> 32:51.408
Your children will
soon be forgotten.

33:18.872 --> 33:21.000
For all of you raw niggers
that don't know...

33:21.166 --> 33:25.546
my name is John Tibeats, William
Ford's chief carpenter.

33:25.712 --> 33:29.091
You will refer
to me as "Master."

33:29.257 --> 33:32.978
Mr. Chapin is the overseer
on this plantation.

33:33.136 --> 33:37.687
You, too, will refer
to him as "Master."

33:38.808 --> 33:40.731
So, clap your hands.

33:44.272 --> 33:46.991
Like this. Come on.

33:47.817 --> 33:50.115
Come on, now.
Clap your hands.

33:54.199 --> 33:56.543
<i>Nigger run
Nigger flew</i>

33:56.701 --> 33:59.079
<i>Nigger tore his shirt in two</i>

33:59.246 --> 34:01.590
<i>Run, run
The pattyroller will get you</i>

34:01.748 --> 34:03.796
<i>Run, nigger, run
Well, you better get away</i>

34:08.338 --> 34:10.215
<i>That's right.
Like you mean it.</i>

34:11.257 --> 34:13.431
<i>Nigger run
Run so fast</i>

34:13.592 --> 34:15.937
<i>Stove his head
in a hornet's nest</i>

34:16.096 --> 34:18.063
<i>Run, run
The pattyroller will get you</i>

34:18.223 --> 34:21.226
<i>Run, nigger, run
Well, you better get away</i>

34:21.976 --> 34:24.321
<i>Run, nigger, run
The pattyroller will get you</i>

34:24.478 --> 34:26.652
<i>Run, nigger, run
Well, you better get away</i>

34:28.650 --> 34:30.652
<i>Some folk say
a nigger don't steal</i>

34:30.819 --> 34:32.992
<i>I caught three in my corn field</i>

34:33.154 --> 34:35.327
<i>One has a bushel
And one has a peck</i>

34:35.489 --> 34:37.663
<i>One has a rope
It was hung around his neck</i>

34:37.826 --> 34:40.248
<i>Run, nigger, run
The pattyroller will get you</i>

34:40.411 --> 34:42.665
<i>Run, nigger, run
Well, you better get away</i>

34:42.831 --> 34:45.004
<i>Run, nigger, run
The pattyroller will get you</i>

34:45.166 --> 34:47.840
<i>Run, nigger, run
Well, you better get away</i>

34:48.003 --> 34:50.347
<i>Hey, Mr. Pattyroller
Don't catch me</i>

34:50.505 --> 34:52.849
<i>Catch that nigger
behind that tree</i>

34:53.007 --> 34:55.351
<i>Run, nigger, run
The pattyroller will get you</i>

34:55.510 --> 34:57.729
<i>Run, nigger, run
Well, you better get away</i>

34:57.887 --> 35:00.015
<i>Run, nigger, run
The pattyroller will get you</i>

35:00.181 --> 35:02.354
<i>Run, nigger, run
Well, you better get away</i>

35:02.517 --> 35:04.690
<i>Run, nigger, run
The pattyroller will get you</i>

35:04.853 --> 35:06.855
<i>Run, nigger, run
Well, you better get away</i>

35:07.355 --> 35:10.154
"I am the God of Abraham,
the God of Isaac..."

35:10.317 --> 35:12.658
"and the God of Jacob."

35:14.029 --> 35:15.531
"And when
the multitude heard this,"

35:15.697 --> 35:18.371
"they were astonished
at his doctrine."

35:19.200 --> 35:22.170
"And then one of them,
which was a lawyer..."

35:22.329 --> 35:25.549
"asked him a question,
tempting him."

36:21.471 --> 36:23.769
<i>The creek is
plenty deep enough to sail.</i>

36:24.391 --> 36:26.485
Even with a boat full of load.

36:26.603 --> 36:27.843
The distance from the work area

36:27.852 --> 36:28.944
to the point on
the latter bayou...

36:29.104 --> 36:30.822
is several miles by water
fewer than land.

36:30.980 --> 36:32.527
It occurs to me that
the expense of transportation

36:32.649 --> 36:34.242
would be
materially diminished...

36:34.401 --> 36:35.448
"Materially diminished"?

36:35.610 --> 36:37.578
...if we use
the waterway.

36:37.737 --> 36:40.490
Are you an engineer,
or a nigger?

36:42.784 --> 36:45.287
Are you an engineer,
or a nigger?

36:46.579 --> 36:47.626
Let the man say his piece.

36:47.789 --> 36:51.464
It's a scheme. Plenty of engineers
have schemed similarly.

36:51.626 --> 36:54.175
The passes are too tight.

36:54.629 --> 36:57.633
I reckon them at more than 12
feet at their most narrow.

36:57.799 --> 36:59.301
Wide enough for
a tub to traverse

36:59.426 --> 37:00.848
if a team of niggers
cleared it out.

37:01.010 --> 37:03.763
And you know what of
transport and terraforming?

37:03.930 --> 37:05.648
I labored repairing
the Champlain canal...

37:05.807 --> 37:09.152
on the section over which William
van Nortwick was superintendent.

37:09.310 --> 37:12.189
With my earnings, I hired several
efficient hands to assist me...

37:12.355 --> 37:13.652
and entered into contracts for

37:13.773 --> 37:15.070
the transportation of
large rafts of timber...

37:15.233 --> 37:17.702
from Lake Champlain to Troy.

37:20.238 --> 37:23.492
Well, I'll admit to being
impressed even if you won't.

37:24.534 --> 37:26.582
Collect a team. See
what good you can do.

37:35.670 --> 37:36.922
You good? Clear it out!

37:37.088 --> 37:38.356
Two, three...

37:41.509 --> 37:44.353
<i>Too late for me</i>

37:44.512 --> 37:47.561
<i>I live or die</i>

37:47.724 --> 37:50.853
<i>Lay down and cry</i>

37:51.019 --> 37:54.114
<i>Hey, boy
I'm tired</i>

37:54.272 --> 37:57.367
<i>My lord
Sometimes</i>

37:57.525 --> 38:00.779
<i>I'm strong
Yes, sir</i>

38:00.945 --> 38:04.324
<i>I'm tall
Yes, sir</i>

38:10.079 --> 38:12.298
Platt, you are a marvel.

38:19.964 --> 38:21.682
What took you so long?

38:22.258 --> 38:24.306
Thank you, Master Ford.

38:41.861 --> 38:43.204
Platt.

39:02.257 --> 39:04.635
My great thanks, Master Ford.

39:04.801 --> 39:06.895
No, my thanks to you.

39:07.053 --> 39:09.351
And it is the least of it.

39:09.514 --> 39:12.768
I hope it brings us both
much joy over the years.

39:43.464 --> 39:44.636
God!

39:49.220 --> 39:50.642
Eliza.

39:55.727 --> 39:56.979
Eliza.

39:57.729 --> 39:58.730
Stop!

39:59.272 --> 40:01.149
Stop your wailing!

40:03.610 --> 40:05.032
If you let yourself be overcome

40:05.153 --> 40:06.621
by sorrow, you will drown in it.

40:06.779 --> 40:08.497
Have you stopped crying
for your children?

40:10.325 --> 40:13.829
You make no sounds, but will you
ever let them go in your heart?

40:18.249 --> 40:20.001
They are as my flesh.

40:20.168 --> 40:22.170
Then who is distressed?

40:22.921 --> 40:25.174
Do I upset the master
and the mistress?

40:25.340 --> 40:27.684
Do you care less about my loss
than their well-being?

40:27.842 --> 40:29.185
Master Ford is a decent man.

40:29.344 --> 40:30.470
He is a slaver!

40:30.637 --> 40:31.654
Under the circumstances.

40:31.679 --> 40:33.477
Under the circumstances,
he is a slaver.

40:33.806 --> 40:35.683
But you truckle at his boot.

40:35.850 --> 40:37.477
You luxuriate in his favor.

40:37.644 --> 40:39.362
I survive!

40:39.520 --> 40:41.568
I will not fall into despair!

40:41.731 --> 40:43.699
I will offer up my talents
to Master Ford!

40:43.858 --> 40:46.657
I will keep myself hearty
until freedom is opportune!

40:46.819 --> 40:48.867
Ford is your opportunity?

40:49.530 --> 40:52.409
You think he does not know that
you are more than you suggest?

40:52.575 --> 40:54.248
But he does nothing for you.

40:54.410 --> 40:55.582
Nothing.

40:56.204 --> 40:59.504
You are no better
than prized livestock.

41:00.041 --> 41:01.418
Call for him. Call!

41:01.584 --> 41:03.712
Tell him of your
previous circumstances,

41:03.878 --> 41:06.051
and see what it
earns you, Solomon.

41:07.548 --> 41:10.392
So, you've settled into
your role as Platt, then?

41:12.387 --> 41:15.615
My back is thick with scars...

41:15.640 --> 41:18.063
for protesting my freedom.

41:18.226 --> 41:19.648
Do not accuse me.

41:20.478 --> 41:24.073
I accuse you of nothing.
I cannot accuse.

41:24.232 --> 41:27.156
I have done dishonorable
things to survive...

41:27.318 --> 41:30.322
and for all of them,
I have ended up here.

41:30.822 --> 41:33.871
No better than
if I stood up for myself.

41:34.492 --> 41:36.745
God, forgive me.

41:36.911 --> 41:39.710
Solomon, let me weep
for my children!

41:50.091 --> 41:52.185
<i>"Whosoever,
therefore, shall humble"</i>

41:52.301 --> 41:54.429
<i>"himself as
this little child..."</i>

41:54.929 --> 41:58.775
"the same is the greatest in the
kingdom of heaven."

41:58.933 --> 42:03.860
"And who so shall receive one
such little child in my name..."

42:04.022 --> 42:05.865
I cannot have that
kind of depression about.

42:06.024 --> 42:08.197
"But who so shall offend
one of these little ones..."

42:08.359 --> 42:11.254
"it were better for him that a millstone
were hanged about his neck..."

42:12.530 --> 42:16.125
"and he were drowned
in the depth of the sea."

42:17.201 --> 42:18.202
Amen.

42:18.745 --> 42:19.917
Amen.

42:32.717 --> 42:34.811
Make them boards flush.

42:35.219 --> 42:36.141
They are, sir.

42:36.304 --> 42:38.306
No, they is no such thing.

42:39.807 --> 42:43.061
They are as smooth to the
touch as a yearling's coat.

42:45.646 --> 42:47.569
Are you calling me a liar, boy?

42:50.485 --> 42:52.829
It's all a matter
of perspective, sir.

42:53.330 --> 42:55.131
From where you stand,
you may see differently,

42:55.156 --> 42:56.783
but the hands are not mistaken.

42:57.325 --> 43:01.580
I simply ask that you use all your
senses before rendering judgment.

43:03.122 --> 43:06.342
Oh, my, you are a brute.

43:07.835 --> 43:09.428
You are a dog.

43:10.088 --> 43:12.762
And no better for
following instruction!

43:14.133 --> 43:15.193
I do as ordered.

43:15.218 --> 43:16.418
Then you'll be up at daybreak.

43:16.677 --> 43:19.351
You will procure
a keg of nails from Chapin...

43:19.514 --> 43:21.516
and commence to
putting on clapboards.

43:21.682 --> 43:22.854
Yes, sir.

43:28.314 --> 43:29.987
Make them boards flush.

43:38.866 --> 43:41.369
No, please!
Please, Sam!

43:41.536 --> 43:43.880
Where am I going?
Where am I going, Sam?

43:44.372 --> 43:46.875
Solomon! Solomon!

43:47.291 --> 43:48.713
Solomon!

43:49.669 --> 43:51.342
Solomon!

43:55.007 --> 43:57.055
Solomon!

44:02.473 --> 44:05.818
<i>When I say I had my
Master's favor, you understand.</i>

44:08.396 --> 44:09.522
And for nine years...

44:09.689 --> 44:13.569
he blessed me with every
comfort and luxury in life.

44:13.734 --> 44:16.203
Silks and jewels...

44:16.362 --> 44:18.831
and even servants
to wait upon us.

44:20.908 --> 44:23.331
Such was our life.

44:23.494 --> 44:26.373
And the life of this beautiful
girl I bore for him.

44:29.542 --> 44:31.715
But Master Berry's daughter...

44:32.670 --> 44:35.549
she always looked at me
with an unkind nature.

44:36.215 --> 44:40.061
And she hated Emily, no matter she
and Emily were flesh of flesh.

44:43.222 --> 44:44.849
As Master Berry's health failed,

44:44.974 --> 44:46.601
she gained power
of the household...

44:47.024 --> 44:49.745
and eventually, I was brought to the
city under the false pretense...

44:49.770 --> 44:52.569
of our free papers
being executed.

44:56.611 --> 44:58.909
My poor children.

45:37.735 --> 45:40.614
I thought I told you to commence
to putting on clapboards.

45:41.656 --> 45:44.500
Yes, Master, I'm about it.
These have all been replaced.

45:45.660 --> 45:47.913
And didn't I tell you
to get a keg of nails?

45:48.079 --> 45:49.752
And so, I did.

45:50.581 --> 45:51.924
So, you did.

45:53.000 --> 45:55.674
God damn you. I thought
you knowed something!

45:55.836 --> 45:57.338
I did as instructed.

45:57.505 --> 46:00.725
If there's something wrong, it's
wrong with the instruction.

46:01.175 --> 46:03.177
You black bastard.

46:03.719 --> 46:08.600
You goddamn black bastard.

46:08.766 --> 46:10.814
Strip your clothes.

46:13.145 --> 46:14.317
Strip.

46:15.314 --> 46:16.861
I will not.

46:26.409 --> 46:32.542
You will not live
to see another day, nigger!

46:33.582 --> 46:34.674
Help!

46:40.464 --> 46:41.716
Murder!

46:44.010 --> 46:45.011
I'm sorry!

46:45.636 --> 46:47.889
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

46:50.933 --> 46:52.526
What is the matter?

46:52.893 --> 46:54.190
What is the matter?

46:55.062 --> 46:56.439
Master Tibeats wants to whip me

46:56.564 --> 46:58.040
for using the nails you gave me.

46:59.859 --> 47:01.987
This ain't done by half.

47:02.445 --> 47:04.664
I will have flesh.

47:04.822 --> 47:07.075
And I will have all of it!

47:10.745 --> 47:11.837
Do not stir.

47:12.330 --> 47:15.709
Do not leave the plantation. For,
if you run, I cannot protect you.

47:16.459 --> 47:17.756
Stay here.

48:21.148 --> 48:25.073
Gentlemen, whoever moves
that nigger is a dead man.

48:26.946 --> 48:29.870
I am the overseer
on this plantation.

48:30.032 --> 48:32.751
William Ford holds
the mortgage on Platt.

48:33.119 --> 48:35.668
If you hang him,
he will lose his debt.

48:36.080 --> 48:38.503
You have no claim to his life.

48:38.958 --> 48:40.505
As for you two...

48:40.668 --> 48:43.672
if you have any regard
for your own safety...

48:43.838 --> 48:44.805
I say, be gone!

48:48.384 --> 48:50.227
You got no cause!

48:50.386 --> 48:53.856
Platt is mine, and mine
to do with as I please!

48:54.014 --> 48:55.937
If you touch...

49:22.293 --> 49:22.964
Sam!

49:23.794 --> 49:26.092
Fetch the mule.
Get Master Ford.

52:21.013 --> 52:23.266
Platt. Poor Platt.

52:52.878 --> 52:55.347
I believe Tibeats is skulking
about the premises somewhere.

52:55.506 --> 52:58.726
He wants you dead,
and he will have it so.

52:58.884 --> 53:01.103
It's no longer
safe for you here.

53:01.261 --> 53:05.061
And I don't believe you will
remain passive if Tibeats attacks.

53:05.224 --> 53:08.273
I have transferred
my debt to Edwin Epps.

53:08.435 --> 53:10.358
He will take charge...

53:31.041 --> 53:32.714
Master Ford.

53:35.087 --> 53:37.840
You must know
that I'm not a slave.

53:38.298 --> 53:39.345
I cannot hear that.

53:39.508 --> 53:41.476
Before I came to you,
I was a freeman.

53:41.635 --> 53:44.309
I'm trying to save your life!

53:45.472 --> 53:48.021
And I have a debt
to be mindful of.

53:50.394 --> 53:52.442
And that is to Edwin Epps now.

53:52.604 --> 53:55.403
And he is a hard man. Prides
himself on being a nigger breaker.

53:55.566 --> 53:58.615
But truthfully, I could find
no others who would take you.

53:59.194 --> 54:01.697
You've made
a reputation of yourself.

54:02.364 --> 54:07.165
Whatever the circumstances, you
are an exceptional nigger, Platt.

54:09.079 --> 54:11.878
But I fear no good
will come of it.

54:34.605 --> 54:36.403
"And that servant..."

54:37.566 --> 54:40.115
"which knew
his lord's will..."

54:41.528 --> 54:44.953
Which knew his lord's will.

54:49.036 --> 54:51.710
"...and prepared
not himself..."

54:53.373 --> 54:55.876
Prepared not himself.

54:59.922 --> 55:02.596
"...neither did
according to his will..."

55:04.551 --> 55:07.725
"shall be beaten
with many stripes."

55:09.056 --> 55:10.524
Do you hear that?

55:11.183 --> 55:12.526
"Stripes."

55:13.769 --> 55:15.897
That nigger that
don't obey his lord...

55:16.063 --> 55:18.111
That's his master, do you see?

55:18.941 --> 55:23.617
That there nigger shall be
beaten with many stripes.

55:25.239 --> 55:29.039
Now, "many"
signifies a great many.

55:29.576 --> 55:33.422
40, 100, 150 lashes.

55:38.085 --> 55:39.678
That's scripture.

55:56.061 --> 55:57.608
Pick that cotton.

55:57.771 --> 55:59.694
Move along, now.

56:01.942 --> 56:04.786
Come on, Edward!
Drive them niggers!

56:04.945 --> 56:07.949
Pick that cotton!
Move along, now.

56:08.657 --> 56:10.625
What are you
doing, boy? Come on!

56:13.453 --> 56:15.672
240 for Bob.

56:16.123 --> 56:18.091
What you got for James?

56:18.500 --> 56:20.628
295 pounds.

56:20.794 --> 56:23.843
That's real good, boy.
That's real good.

56:24.464 --> 56:26.592
182 for Platt.

56:28.218 --> 56:31.097
How much can even an
average nigger pick a day?

56:31.263 --> 56:32.515
200 pounds.

56:32.681 --> 56:34.558
This nigger ain't even average.

56:36.351 --> 56:38.649
512 pounds for Patsey.

56:38.812 --> 56:41.486
512!

56:42.399 --> 56:46.404
You menfolk got no shame
letting Patsey out-pick you.

56:47.988 --> 56:51.538
The day ain't yet come she
swung lower than 500 pounds.

56:54.870 --> 56:57.339
Queen of the fields, she is.

56:57.497 --> 56:58.544
138 pounds...

56:58.707 --> 57:00.459
I ain't done, Treach.

57:01.168 --> 57:04.763
Ain't I owed a minute to luxuriate
on the work Patsey done?

57:05.297 --> 57:06.469
Yes, sir.

57:10.594 --> 57:12.187
Damn queen.

57:13.680 --> 57:16.684
Born and bred to the field.

57:18.226 --> 57:20.604
A nigger among niggers.

57:22.689 --> 57:24.691
And God gave her to me.

57:28.862 --> 57:31.786
A lesson in the rewards
of righteous living.

57:33.742 --> 57:35.961
All be observant to that.

57:37.079 --> 57:39.047
All!

57:39.873 --> 57:42.376
Now, Treach. Now speak.

57:43.085 --> 57:46.089
138 pounds for Phebe.

57:46.797 --> 57:49.892
Hit 145 yesterday.
Pull her out.

57:50.717 --> 57:52.719
206 pounds for George.

57:53.136 --> 57:55.059
How much he pick yesterday?

57:56.098 --> 57:57.566
229.

57:57.724 --> 57:58.896
Get him out.

57:59.059 --> 58:00.481
Come on, get.

58:02.396 --> 58:03.818
Come on.

58:03.981 --> 58:05.779
Come on, boy, move!

59:54.049 --> 59:55.016
Get up!

59:55.175 --> 59:56.643
We dance tonight!
Get up!

59:56.802 --> 59:58.304
Get your fiddle, Platt.
Get up!

59:58.470 --> 01:00:00.518
Come on!
Get, get, get!

01:00:00.680 --> 01:00:02.523
Come on, Platt. Come on!

01:00:14.319 --> 01:00:17.323
Come on, where's your merriment?
Move your feet!

01:00:31.294 --> 01:00:32.420
Sell her.

01:00:32.587 --> 01:00:33.588
What's all this?

01:00:33.755 --> 01:00:36.258
You will sell the negress.

01:00:36.424 --> 01:00:38.222
Sell little Pats?

01:00:38.385 --> 01:00:41.104
She pick with more vigor
than any other nigger.

01:00:41.555 --> 01:00:42.405
Choose another to go.

01:00:42.430 --> 01:00:44.057
No other.

01:00:44.224 --> 01:00:45.567
Sell her.

01:00:45.934 --> 01:00:47.311
I will not.

01:00:48.562 --> 01:00:51.532
You will remove that black
bitch from this property...

01:00:51.690 --> 01:00:54.614
or I'll take myself
back to Cheneyville.

01:00:58.363 --> 01:01:00.661
Back to that hog's trough
where I found you?

01:01:03.618 --> 01:01:07.498
Do not set yourself up
against Patsey, my dear.

01:01:11.459 --> 01:01:13.257
Because I will rid myself of you

01:01:13.420 --> 01:01:15.263
well before I do away with her.

01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:24.727
What you looking at?

01:01:26.016 --> 01:01:27.689
Damn woman.

01:01:28.476 --> 01:01:30.570
I won't have my mood spoiled.

01:01:30.979 --> 01:01:32.822
I will not.

01:01:34.191 --> 01:01:35.031
Dance.

01:01:35.275 --> 01:01:36.902
Dance, I says!

01:01:41.448 --> 01:01:42.950
Come on!

01:01:43.116 --> 01:01:46.511
Pick it up, Platt.
Play that fiddle, boy.

01:02:22.989 --> 01:02:24.115
Platt.

01:02:25.992 --> 01:02:27.460
Yes, Mistress?

01:02:29.496 --> 01:02:32.045
Can you find your
way to Bartholomew's?

01:02:32.666 --> 01:02:33.918
I can, ma'am.

01:02:34.334 --> 01:02:36.086
This is a list of
goods and sundries.

01:02:36.253 --> 01:02:39.177
You will take it to be filled
and return immediately.

01:02:39.339 --> 01:02:41.558
Take your tag.

01:02:41.716 --> 01:02:43.514
Tell Bartholomew to
add it to our debt.

01:02:43.677 --> 01:02:44.678
Yes, Mistress.

01:02:46.846 --> 01:02:48.940
Where you from, Platt?

01:02:51.059 --> 01:02:52.311
I told you.

01:02:52.477 --> 01:02:54.229
Tell me again.

01:02:54.771 --> 01:02:55.772
Washington.

01:02:55.939 --> 01:02:56.906
Who were your master?

01:02:57.023 --> 01:02:57.990
Master name a Freeman.

01:02:58.149 --> 01:02:59.901
Was he a learned man?

01:03:00.735 --> 01:03:02.328
I suppose so.

01:03:02.487 --> 01:03:03.909
He learn you to read?

01:03:05.865 --> 01:03:07.993
A word, here or there.

01:03:08.335 --> 01:03:10.095
But I have no understanding
of the written...

01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:12.339
Don't trouble yourself with it.

01:03:12.789 --> 01:03:16.293
Same as the rest. Master brought
you here to work, that's all.

01:03:17.460 --> 01:03:20.134
Any more will
earn you 100 lashes.

01:04:26.112 --> 01:04:27.113
Come here, boy.

01:04:30.116 --> 01:04:31.459
Come on.

01:04:47.634 --> 01:04:49.307
Where you going, boy?

01:04:49.469 --> 01:04:51.972
On my way to Bartholomew's.

01:04:52.138 --> 01:04:54.391
Sent by Mistress Epps.

01:04:58.186 --> 01:05:00.154
You best get there, then.

01:05:01.231 --> 01:05:02.824
Get there quick.

01:05:51.865 --> 01:05:53.208
Any trouble?

01:05:53.366 --> 01:05:55.869
No, ma'am. No trouble.

01:06:54.594 --> 01:06:56.312
Platt Epps, good Sunday morning.

01:06:56.471 --> 01:06:57.768
Good morning, Master Shaw.

01:06:57.931 --> 01:07:00.400
Master sent me to retrieve Patsey.
May I approach?

01:07:00.558 --> 01:07:01.775
You may.

01:07:12.237 --> 01:07:13.864
Excuse me, Mistress Shaw.

01:07:14.280 --> 01:07:15.623
Nigger Platt.

01:07:15.782 --> 01:07:17.580
Patsey, Master
wishes you to return.

01:07:17.742 --> 01:07:19.369
The Sabbath day,
I is free to roam.

01:07:19.786 --> 01:07:22.539
Master sent me running to fetch
you, said no time should be wasted.

01:07:22.789 --> 01:07:24.416
Drink of tea?

01:07:24.582 --> 01:07:26.459
Thank you, Mistress,
but I don't dare.

01:07:26.626 --> 01:07:28.628
Would you know of
Master Epps's consternation...

01:07:28.795 --> 01:07:31.969
to be any lessened
with your timely return?

01:07:32.632 --> 01:07:34.930
Anger's his constant condition.

01:07:35.093 --> 01:07:35.889
Sit.

01:07:36.594 --> 01:07:38.642
Sit and drink
the tea that I offered.

01:07:43.768 --> 01:07:45.954
What'n be Epps's concern?

01:07:47.772 --> 01:07:49.490
I'd rather not say.

01:07:50.066 --> 01:07:54.321
Oh, little gossip on the Sabbath be fine.
All things in moderation.

01:07:56.072 --> 01:07:58.120
As you are aware...

01:07:58.283 --> 01:08:04.165
Master Epps is a man
of hard countenance.

01:08:04.497 --> 01:08:06.670
You know he has ill feeling
towards your husband.

01:08:06.833 --> 01:08:08.085
He do.

01:08:09.002 --> 01:08:11.096
Master Epps has somehow
come to believe...

01:08:11.254 --> 01:08:15.259
that Master Shaw
is something of a lothario.

01:08:16.843 --> 01:08:19.312
A misguided belief, no doubt.

01:08:19.470 --> 01:08:20.642
No doubt...

01:08:20.805 --> 01:08:22.933
if not born out of truth itself.

01:08:25.184 --> 01:08:26.777
I meant no disrespect.

01:08:27.185 --> 01:08:28.984
He ain't heard you.

01:08:29.354 --> 01:08:31.666
I meant no
disrespect to you, Mistress.

01:08:34.569 --> 01:08:38.163
Got no cause to worry
for my sensibilities.

01:08:38.906 --> 01:08:43.502
I ain't felt the end of a lash
in more years I can recall.

01:08:43.661 --> 01:08:45.755
I ain't worked a field, neither.

01:08:46.372 --> 01:08:48.170
Where once I served...

01:08:48.332 --> 01:08:51.256
now, I have others serving me.

01:08:51.877 --> 01:08:54.471
The cost to
my current existence...

01:08:54.631 --> 01:08:57.760
be Master Shaw
broadcasting his affections...

01:08:57.925 --> 01:09:00.769
and me enjoying
the pantomime of his fidelity.

01:09:02.138 --> 01:09:06.564
If that what keep me from cotton
picking niggers, that what it be.

01:09:06.725 --> 01:09:10.447
A small and reasonable price
to be paid, for sure.

01:09:14.901 --> 01:09:17.450
I know what it like
to be the object

01:09:17.569 --> 01:09:20.163
of Master's predilections
and peculiarities.

01:09:21.323 --> 01:09:23.952
A lusty visit in the night...

01:09:24.118 --> 01:09:26.587
or a visitation with the whip.

01:09:27.955 --> 01:09:29.502
Take comfort, Patsey.

01:09:29.749 --> 01:09:31.877
The good Lord will manage Epps.

01:09:32.335 --> 01:09:36.886
In His own time, the good
Lord will manage them all.

01:09:37.173 --> 01:09:40.426
The curse of the pharaohs
were a poor example...

01:09:40.593 --> 01:09:43.517
of what wait for
the plantation class.

01:09:48.935 --> 01:09:50.608
This is nice.

01:10:01.948 --> 01:10:04.497
Pats. Patsey!

01:10:04.659 --> 01:10:06.332
Do not look in his direction.
Continue on.

01:10:06.953 --> 01:10:08.705
Patsey!
Found her, Master.

01:10:09.205 --> 01:10:11.503
And brought her back,
just as instructed.

01:10:14.085 --> 01:10:16.213
What did you just now tell her?

01:10:16.379 --> 01:10:18.052
What did you say to Pats?

01:10:19.215 --> 01:10:20.967
No words were spoken,
none of consequence.

01:10:22.760 --> 01:10:24.353
You're a liar.

01:10:24.679 --> 01:10:26.647
You damn liar.

01:10:27.390 --> 01:10:29.688
I saw you talking with her.

01:10:30.643 --> 01:10:32.190
Tell me.

01:10:33.813 --> 01:10:35.531
I cannot speak of
what did not occur.

01:10:35.815 --> 01:10:37.567
I'll cut your black throat!

01:10:37.734 --> 01:10:38.860
Master!

01:10:39.402 --> 01:10:40.824
You come here.

01:10:41.195 --> 01:10:42.355
Master Epps.
I said come here!

01:10:42.488 --> 01:10:43.888
I brought her back,
just like you...

01:10:45.241 --> 01:10:46.709
Come here!
Master!

01:10:48.911 --> 01:10:49.912
Master.

01:10:52.582 --> 01:10:54.835
I got her, just as instructed.

01:10:56.210 --> 01:10:57.211
Master Epps!

01:10:57.503 --> 01:10:59.005
You stay away from Pats, boy.

01:11:05.219 --> 01:11:06.562
Master Epps.

01:11:33.372 --> 01:11:35.249
It's the Lord's day.

01:11:36.709 --> 01:11:39.588
Ain't nothing Christian
in us carrying on like this.

01:11:46.552 --> 01:11:48.020
I concede to you.

01:11:50.723 --> 01:11:52.020
In the name of valor...

01:11:53.684 --> 01:11:54.901
help your master to his feet.

01:11:59.565 --> 01:12:00.691
I'm gonna kill you!

01:12:01.192 --> 01:12:02.694
What's the fuss?

01:12:02.860 --> 01:12:04.533
Master Epps
believed Patsey and me

01:12:04.654 --> 01:12:06.327
to be in conversation
when we were not.

01:12:06.489 --> 01:12:07.741
I tried to explain,
but it's led to all this.

01:12:07.907 --> 01:12:08.749
What is it?

01:12:09.200 --> 01:12:12.044
You can't remain the Sabbath
without her under your eye?

01:12:12.203 --> 01:12:14.013
You are
a no-account bastard.

01:12:14.038 --> 01:12:16.040
A filthy, godless heathen.

01:12:16.207 --> 01:12:18.835
My bed is too holy
for you to share.

01:12:19.001 --> 01:12:20.093
What's he been telling you?

01:12:20.253 --> 01:12:21.596
Of your misbegotten ways.

01:12:21.754 --> 01:12:23.756
And he would know
what of anything?

01:12:24.882 --> 01:12:26.759
I ain't even
spoken with him today.

01:12:27.552 --> 01:12:29.429
You lying nigger, Platt.

01:12:30.096 --> 01:12:31.188
Have I?

01:12:33.558 --> 01:12:34.775
Have I?

01:12:37.353 --> 01:12:39.776
There. There's
all the truth he got.

01:12:40.773 --> 01:12:42.025
Damn nigger.

01:14:33.886 --> 01:14:35.138
Patsey.

01:16:31.921 --> 01:16:34.344
A moment from the dancing.

01:16:35.508 --> 01:16:37.761
Come sample what
I baked for y'all.

01:16:37.927 --> 01:16:40.738
Thank you, Mistress.

01:16:40.763 --> 01:16:41.864
Thank you, Mistress.

01:16:41.889 --> 01:16:44.017
There will be
none for you, Patsey.

01:16:45.518 --> 01:16:47.020
You see that?

01:16:47.394 --> 01:16:50.193
You see that look
of insolence she give me?

01:16:51.023 --> 01:16:52.525
I seen nothing
but her turn away.

01:16:52.691 --> 01:16:54.910
Are you blind or ignorant?

01:16:55.069 --> 01:16:57.367
It was hot, hateful scorn.

01:16:57.530 --> 01:16:59.624
It filled that black face.

01:17:00.199 --> 01:17:01.509
You tell me you didn't see it...

01:17:01.534 --> 01:17:05.539
it's because you choose not to
look, or are you saying I lie?

01:17:05.704 --> 01:17:08.048
Whatever it was, it passed.

01:17:08.707 --> 01:17:11.460
Is that how you
are with the niggers?

01:17:12.044 --> 01:17:15.218
Letting every ill thought
fester inside them?

01:17:15.965 --> 01:17:17.387
Look at them.

01:17:17.550 --> 01:17:19.723
They foul with it.

01:17:19.885 --> 01:17:21.979
They foul with their hate.

01:17:22.721 --> 01:17:26.726
You let it be, it's gonna come
back to us in the dark of night.

01:17:26.892 --> 01:17:28.439
You want that?

01:17:29.145 --> 01:17:31.864
You want them
black animals leave us

01:17:31.981 --> 01:17:34.655
gut like pigs in our own sleep?

01:17:35.067 --> 01:17:36.193
Oh...

01:17:36.819 --> 01:17:40.073
You are manless.

01:17:40.239 --> 01:17:42.913
A damn eunuch if there ever was.

01:17:43.492 --> 01:17:45.335
If you won't stand
for me, I pray you'd

01:17:45.452 --> 01:17:47.250
at least be a credit
to your own kind...

01:17:47.413 --> 01:17:49.632
and beat every foul
thought from them.

01:18:00.092 --> 01:18:01.093
Beat it from them!

01:18:18.277 --> 01:18:19.119
Eat.

01:18:20.362 --> 01:18:21.989
Fill yourselves.

01:18:22.781 --> 01:18:24.033
And then we dance.

01:18:29.330 --> 01:18:31.708
I said, eat.

01:18:46.972 --> 01:18:47.973
Platt.

01:18:49.642 --> 01:18:51.064
Platt, you awake?

01:18:54.855 --> 01:18:55.902
I am.

01:18:57.066 --> 01:18:59.239
I have a request.

01:18:59.735 --> 01:19:01.908
An act of kindness.

01:19:05.157 --> 01:19:07.876
I secreted it from the mistress.

01:19:09.578 --> 01:19:10.329
Return it.

01:19:10.496 --> 01:19:12.169
It yours, Platt.

01:19:13.499 --> 01:19:15.172
For what cause?

01:19:15.334 --> 01:19:19.510
All I ask, end my life.

01:19:20.714 --> 01:19:23.934
Take my body to
the margin of the swamp.

01:19:24.093 --> 01:19:27.097
Take me by the throat,
hold me low in the water...

01:19:27.263 --> 01:19:29.937
until I is still
and without life.

01:19:30.516 --> 01:19:32.268
Bury me in
a lonely place of dying.

01:19:32.434 --> 01:19:34.232
I will do no such thing.

01:19:35.437 --> 01:19:37.189
The gory detail
with which you speak...

01:19:37.356 --> 01:19:39.859
I thought on it long and hard.

01:19:41.235 --> 01:19:43.203
It is melancholia.

01:19:43.779 --> 01:19:45.281
Nothing more.

01:19:46.448 --> 01:19:49.247
How can you fall
into such despair?

01:19:49.410 --> 01:19:52.459
How can you not know?

01:19:54.581 --> 01:19:58.552
I ain't got no
comfort in this life.

01:20:00.879 --> 01:20:04.884
If I can't buy mercy from you...

01:20:05.050 --> 01:20:07.144
I'll beg it.

01:20:07.303 --> 01:20:08.896
There are others.

01:20:09.930 --> 01:20:11.398
Beg them.
I'm begging you.

01:20:11.557 --> 01:20:12.729
Why?

01:20:13.392 --> 01:20:17.238
Why would you consign me to damnation
with such an ungodly request?

01:20:17.396 --> 01:20:19.398
There is God here!

01:20:20.232 --> 01:20:23.657
God is merciful...

01:20:23.819 --> 01:20:26.447
and he forgive merciful acts.

01:20:26.822 --> 01:20:29.325
Won't be no hell for you.

01:20:31.410 --> 01:20:32.662
Do it.

01:20:37.750 --> 01:20:40.799
Do what I ain't got the
strength to do myself.

01:21:20.209 --> 01:21:21.961
<i>It's a plague.</i>

01:21:22.961 --> 01:21:24.008
<i>It's cotton worm.</i>

01:21:24.171 --> 01:21:26.970
<i>It's a plague.
It's damn biblical.</i>

01:21:28.175 --> 01:21:31.019
<i>Two seasons God done
sent a plague to smite me.</i>

01:21:33.472 --> 01:21:36.976
<i>What I done that
God hates me so?</i>

01:21:43.148 --> 01:21:45.321
It's that godless lot.

01:21:47.194 --> 01:21:49.037
They brought this on me.

01:21:49.196 --> 01:21:51.494
I bring them God's
word and heathens

01:21:51.615 --> 01:21:53.868
they are,
they brung me God's scorn.

01:21:57.538 --> 01:21:58.539
Damn!

01:21:59.415 --> 01:22:00.416
Damn you!

01:22:01.834 --> 01:22:03.211
Damn all y'all!

01:22:30.988 --> 01:22:31.989
Judge.

01:22:32.281 --> 01:22:33.828
Mister Epps.

01:22:35.617 --> 01:22:39.417
I am deeply saddened
to hear about your misfortune.

01:22:39.997 --> 01:22:42.091
Your price don't
reflect your concern.

01:22:44.168 --> 01:22:45.169
Listen up.

01:22:45.836 --> 01:22:47.713
You're Judge Turner's
for the season.

01:22:47.838 --> 01:22:49.681
More, if need be,
until my crops return.

01:22:50.382 --> 01:22:52.760
Y'all bring no disrespect to me.

01:22:52.926 --> 01:22:55.850
Don't bring no biblical
plagues to him, you hear?

01:22:56.013 --> 01:22:58.107
Or I'll take it
out on your skin.

01:22:59.099 --> 01:23:00.521
Get out.

01:23:52.180 --> 01:23:54.421
Get off the porch. You ain't
supposed to be on the porch.

01:23:54.446 --> 01:23:55.743
Get off the porch.

01:24:02.454 --> 01:24:03.797
Platt, is it?

01:24:04.289 --> 01:24:05.290
Yes, sir.

01:24:05.457 --> 01:24:08.461
You cultivate cane previously?

01:24:08.961 --> 01:24:10.133
No, sir, I have not.

01:24:10.295 --> 01:24:12.468
It comes to you quite naturally.

01:24:12.631 --> 01:24:13.632
Are you educated?

01:24:14.299 --> 01:24:17.678
No, sir. Niggers are hired
to work, not read or write.

01:24:19.513 --> 01:24:21.140
You play the fiddle.

01:24:21.640 --> 01:24:23.438
Yes, sir. Yes, I do.

01:24:24.810 --> 01:24:26.983
Willard Yarner,
a planter up the bayou...

01:24:27.145 --> 01:24:30.445
celebrates his anniversary
in three weeks' time.

01:24:30.607 --> 01:24:32.860
I'll hold out your name to him.

01:24:33.026 --> 01:24:35.620
What you earn is yours to keep.

01:24:36.280 --> 01:24:37.372
Yes, sir.

01:24:37.990 --> 01:24:39.287
Mind yourself, Platt.

01:26:55.127 --> 01:26:57.255
Whoa!

01:27:03.844 --> 01:27:05.187
Joyous day.

01:27:05.971 --> 01:27:07.973
Joyous day.

01:27:08.640 --> 01:27:10.893
Dark times is behind us.

01:27:11.059 --> 01:27:14.484
Clean living and prayer
done lifted the plague!

01:27:16.356 --> 01:27:19.735
As thick and white
as New England snow.

01:27:21.570 --> 01:27:24.073
Now, my niggers
is returned to me.

01:27:28.160 --> 01:27:31.084
Heard Judge Turner
gave you favor.

01:27:35.083 --> 01:27:39.509
Did you beguile him, Platt,
with your slick nigger ways?

01:27:42.841 --> 01:27:44.935
You won't stand idle, boy.

01:27:45.385 --> 01:27:47.353
Not on my land.

01:27:50.182 --> 01:27:51.900
Much work to do!

01:27:54.019 --> 01:27:57.023
Days of old long since, huh?

01:28:03.945 --> 01:28:05.447
Joyous.

01:28:05.614 --> 01:28:08.914
Joyous, indeed! Whoo!

01:28:10.660 --> 01:28:12.971
Let's go find something
sweet for you. Hmm?

01:28:12.996 --> 01:28:14.168
Mmm-hmm.

01:28:15.832 --> 01:28:16.628
Candy.

01:28:16.792 --> 01:28:18.009
Candy?

01:28:19.044 --> 01:28:21.422
<i>Oh, pick this cotton</i>

01:28:21.588 --> 01:28:22.606
<i>Pick this cotton</i>

01:28:22.631 --> 01:28:24.929
<i>Oh, pick this cotton</i>

01:28:25.091 --> 01:28:27.219
<i>Oh, pick that cotton</i>

01:28:27.385 --> 01:28:29.137
<i>Man ain't mean, boys</i>

01:28:29.304 --> 01:28:30.851
<i>Man ain't mean, boys</i>

01:28:31.014 --> 01:28:33.016
<i>Man ain't mean, boys</i>

01:28:33.183 --> 01:28:34.275
<i>Man ain't mean</i>

01:28:34.434 --> 01:28:36.903
<i>Oh, work this cotton</i>

01:28:37.062 --> 01:28:38.063
<i>Work this cotton</i>

01:28:38.230 --> 01:28:40.983
<i>Oh, work this cotton</i>

01:28:41.149 --> 01:28:42.275
<i>Work this cotton</i>

01:28:42.442 --> 01:28:45.036
<i>Oh, work ain't hard, boys</i>

01:28:45.529 --> 01:28:46.530
<i>George.</i>

01:28:46.696 --> 01:28:48.448
<i>180 pounds.</i>

01:28:48.865 --> 01:28:50.208
Patsey.

01:28:50.367 --> 01:28:52.790
520 pounds for Patsey.

01:28:52.953 --> 01:28:55.752
That's my girl.
Don't ever let me down.

01:28:56.081 --> 01:28:57.298
Platt?

01:28:57.457 --> 01:28:59.710
160 pounds.

01:29:01.461 --> 01:29:03.054
Armsby?

01:29:03.588 --> 01:29:05.511
64 pounds.

01:29:10.345 --> 01:29:12.313
A good day's labor
would average 200 pounds.

01:29:12.597 --> 01:29:13.849
Yes, sir.

01:29:18.520 --> 01:29:21.239
I'm sure in time, you'll
develop as a picker.

01:29:21.648 --> 01:29:23.650
But it takes effort, boy.

01:29:25.193 --> 01:29:27.321
Put some damn effort into it.

01:29:27.487 --> 01:29:28.158
Yes, sir.

01:29:28.321 --> 01:29:30.415
Take them out, get to whipping.

01:29:36.913 --> 01:29:38.961
It's a tragedy.

01:29:40.083 --> 01:29:41.835
How does such come to pass?

01:29:42.836 --> 01:29:46.056
Working a field and picking
cotton like a lowly hand.

01:29:46.590 --> 01:29:48.968
I'm of a damn sight
better station.

01:29:50.010 --> 01:29:52.104
I worked as
an overseer, you know.

01:29:52.262 --> 01:29:53.684
I did not know, sir.

01:29:53.847 --> 01:29:55.349
Not "sir."

01:29:56.016 --> 01:29:57.859
Just "Armsby."

01:29:58.727 --> 01:30:00.900
I'm not owed more than
any other in the field.

01:30:01.062 --> 01:30:04.032
How did you arrive at such
a place, if I may ask?

01:30:04.441 --> 01:30:07.035
Ask, it's just conversation.

01:30:09.154 --> 01:30:12.124
I became a little too
dependent on the whiskey...

01:30:12.282 --> 01:30:14.751
a little too
undependable on the job.

01:30:15.994 --> 01:30:18.793
Now, before you say
I'm just a sorry drunkard...

01:30:18.955 --> 01:30:21.083
let me state my case.

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:24.128
As reliable employment
as overseeing is,

01:30:24.252 --> 01:30:26.346
it is no easy chore
on the spirit.

01:30:27.172 --> 01:30:30.016
I say, no man of conscious...

01:30:30.175 --> 01:30:32.644
can take the lash to another
human day in and day out...

01:30:32.802 --> 01:30:35.180
without shredding
at his own self.

01:30:36.181 --> 01:30:38.354
Takes him to a place...

01:30:38.516 --> 01:30:43.022
where he either makes excuses
within his mind to be unaffected...

01:30:43.521 --> 01:30:46.866
or he finds some way to trample
his guilty sensations.

01:30:47.776 --> 01:30:49.369
So, I trampled.

01:30:49.527 --> 01:30:51.450
With frequency.

01:30:52.989 --> 01:30:56.118
I gave in to tales
of wealth and prosperity.

01:30:59.371 --> 01:31:03.877
But such profitable outcomes are
reserved for plantation masters.

01:31:04.501 --> 01:31:07.675
It's the lot of
the rest of us to serve.

01:31:09.297 --> 01:31:14.679
Now, all I want is to earn a
decent wage and get myself home.

01:31:46.876 --> 01:31:48.970
The proceeds of
my fiddling performances.

01:31:49.796 --> 01:31:53.926
Just a few picayunes,
but all I have in the world.

01:31:54.551 --> 01:31:57.930
I promise them to you if you
will do me the favor I require.

01:31:58.096 --> 01:32:02.146
But I beg you not to expose me
if you cannot grant the request.

01:32:02.684 --> 01:32:03.776
Uh...

01:32:04.477 --> 01:32:06.104
What is it you ask?

01:32:06.271 --> 01:32:08.444
First, your word, sir.

01:32:09.149 --> 01:32:10.150
On my honor.

01:32:12.277 --> 01:32:14.279
It's a simple enough request.

01:32:15.655 --> 01:32:17.453
I only ask that
you deposit a letter

01:32:17.574 --> 01:32:19.326
at the post office
in Marksville...

01:32:19.492 --> 01:32:22.962
and that you keep the action
an inviolable secret forever.

01:32:26.166 --> 01:32:28.635
A patron is what I require, sir.

01:32:35.175 --> 01:32:36.017
I'll do it.

01:32:37.135 --> 01:32:39.558
And I'll accept
whatever payment's offered.

01:32:42.307 --> 01:32:44.856
To assist you,
I put my own self at risk.

01:32:45.643 --> 01:32:47.486
I will do so...

01:32:47.645 --> 01:32:50.819
but fair compensation
is all I ask.

01:33:00.325 --> 01:33:02.248
Draw up your letter.

01:33:02.410 --> 01:33:04.879
We'll meet again in two days?

01:33:06.581 --> 01:33:08.379
In two days.

01:33:11.169 --> 01:33:12.671
Thank you.

01:34:30.290 --> 01:34:32.088
Well, boy...

01:34:32.250 --> 01:34:37.097
I understand I got a learned
nigger that writes letters.

01:34:38.173 --> 01:34:41.268
Tries to get white
fellas to mail them.

01:34:47.599 --> 01:34:50.273
Armsby told me today...

01:34:50.435 --> 01:34:52.938
the devil was among my niggers.

01:34:54.606 --> 01:34:57.576
That I had one that
needed watching...

01:34:57.734 --> 01:35:00.078
or he would run away.

01:35:02.030 --> 01:35:03.907
When I asked him why...

01:35:04.782 --> 01:35:08.286
he said you come over to him...

01:35:08.453 --> 01:35:11.297
waked him up in the
middle of the night...

01:35:11.456 --> 01:35:14.130
and wanted him to
carry a letter...

01:35:15.376 --> 01:35:17.128
to Marksville.

01:35:22.217 --> 01:35:24.640
What do you got to say to that?

01:35:27.430 --> 01:35:29.228
There's no truth to it.

01:35:30.141 --> 01:35:31.643
You say.

01:35:33.311 --> 01:35:36.110
How could I write a letter
without ink or paper?

01:35:37.273 --> 01:35:40.777
Who am I gonna write to? I got
no friends living as I know of.

01:35:41.903 --> 01:35:43.576
That Armsby...

01:35:44.989 --> 01:35:48.493
That Armsby is a lying,
drunken fellow.

01:35:50.328 --> 01:35:53.252
Didn't he want you to
hire him as an overseer?

01:35:55.124 --> 01:35:56.751
Well, that's it.

01:35:58.127 --> 01:36:00.328
He wants to make you believe
we're all gonna run away...

01:36:00.338 --> 01:36:02.841
so you'll hire him
as an overseer.

01:36:04.259 --> 01:36:06.728
He believes you're a soft soap.

01:36:07.595 --> 01:36:10.064
And he's given to such talk.

01:36:10.890 --> 01:36:14.690
Made this story
out of whole cloth...

01:36:15.228 --> 01:36:17.572
because he wants a situation.

01:36:22.860 --> 01:36:25.409
It's all a lie, Master.

01:36:30.868 --> 01:36:32.870
It's all a lie.

01:36:41.045 --> 01:36:43.047
I'll be damned.

01:36:49.095 --> 01:36:51.848
Were he not free
and white, Platt.

01:36:53.891 --> 01:36:56.269
Were he not free and white.

01:38:14.180 --> 01:38:16.274
<i>Sun gonna set here</i>

01:38:16.432 --> 01:38:18.184
<i>Under the mountain</i>

01:38:18.351 --> 01:38:20.399
<i>Sun gonna set here</i>

01:38:20.561 --> 01:38:22.279
<i>Under the mountain</i>

01:38:22.438 --> 01:38:24.315
<i>Sun gonna set here</i>

01:38:24.482 --> 01:38:26.450
<i>Under the mountain</i>

01:38:27.610 --> 01:38:29.078
Edward!

01:38:29.237 --> 01:38:30.864
Get him water.

01:38:38.204 --> 01:38:39.672
Get up!

01:38:40.581 --> 01:38:41.833
Get up!

01:38:48.506 --> 01:38:49.883
Nigger, get up!

01:38:56.013 --> 01:38:58.266
What you looking at, boy?

01:38:59.559 --> 01:39:01.687
Keep picking, boy!

01:39:14.615 --> 01:39:18.210
I just wanna say something
about Uncle Abram.

01:39:22.457 --> 01:39:24.551
He was a good man...

01:39:24.876 --> 01:39:28.130
and he always looked out for
us ever since we were little.

01:39:28.921 --> 01:39:30.548
God love him.

01:39:31.215 --> 01:39:33.809
God bless him.
God keep him.

01:39:34.886 --> 01:39:36.263
Amen.

01:39:51.569 --> 01:39:54.948
<i>Went down to the River Jordan</i>

01:39:55.114 --> 01:39:58.288
<i>Where John baptized three</i>

01:39:58.451 --> 01:40:01.455
<i>When I woke the devil in hell</i>

01:40:01.621 --> 01:40:04.420
<i>Said Johnny baptized me</i>

01:40:04.582 --> 01:40:08.086
<i>I said roll, Jordan, roll</i>

01:40:08.586 --> 01:40:11.089
<i>Roll, Jordan, roll</i>

01:40:11.255 --> 01:40:14.259
<i>My soul will
rise in heaven, Lord</i>

01:40:14.425 --> 01:40:16.974
<i>For the year when Jordan roll</i>

01:40:17.136 --> 01:40:20.515
<i>Well, some say
John was a Baptist</i>

01:40:20.681 --> 01:40:23.275
<i>Some say John was a Jew</i>

01:40:23.434 --> 01:40:25.812
<i>But I say John was a preacher</i>

01:40:25.978 --> 01:40:28.948
<i>'Cause my Bible says so too</i>

01:40:29.106 --> 01:40:32.610
<i>I said roll, Jordan, roll</i>

01:40:32.777 --> 01:40:35.280
<i>Roll, Jordan, roll</i>

01:40:35.446 --> 01:40:38.450
<i>My soul will
rise in heaven, Lord</i>

01:40:38.616 --> 01:40:40.368
<i>For the year when Jordan roll</i>

01:40:40.535 --> 01:40:41.957
<i>Hallelujah</i>

01:40:42.119 --> 01:40:47.626
<i>Roll, Jordan, roll</i>

01:40:47.792 --> 01:40:50.841
<i>My soul will
rise in heaven, Lord</i>

01:40:51.003 --> 01:40:52.846
<i>For the year when Jordan roll</i>

01:40:53.005 --> 01:40:54.222
<i>Hallelujah</i>

01:40:54.382 --> 01:41:00.139
<i>Roll, Jordan, roll</i>

01:41:00.304 --> 01:41:03.353
<i>My soul will
rise in heaven, Lord</i>

01:41:03.516 --> 01:41:05.518
<i>For the year when Jordan roll</i>

01:41:05.685 --> 01:41:07.028
<i>Everybody say</i>

01:41:07.186 --> 01:41:12.659
<i>Roll, Jordan, roll</i>

01:41:12.817 --> 01:41:15.821
<i>My soul will
rise in heaven, Lord</i>

01:41:15.987 --> 01:41:17.864
<i>For the year when Jordan roll</i>

01:41:18.030 --> 01:41:19.156
<i>Oh, children</i>

01:41:19.323 --> 01:41:24.750
<i>Roll, Jordan, roll</i>

01:41:24.912 --> 01:41:27.836
<i>My soul will
rise in heaven, Lord</i>

01:41:27.999 --> 01:41:29.751
<i>For the year when Jordan roll</i>

01:41:29.917 --> 01:41:31.260
<i>Hallelujah</i>

01:41:31.419 --> 01:41:36.846
<i>Roll, Jordan, roll</i>

01:41:37.008 --> 01:41:39.887
<i>My soul will
rise in heaven, Lord</i>

01:41:40.052 --> 01:41:42.521
<i>For the year when Jordan roll</i>

01:42:02.366 --> 01:42:04.118
Right to the end.

01:42:12.627 --> 01:42:14.174
Hey, Bass.

01:42:15.087 --> 01:42:16.555
Oh, no, no, no.

01:42:16.714 --> 01:42:19.183
No shame in taking
respite from the heat.

01:42:19.342 --> 01:42:21.060
Drink, shade.

01:42:21.218 --> 01:42:23.863
It's ungodly for travelers,
hearty or otherwise.

01:42:28.893 --> 01:42:29.985
What's funny?

01:42:30.144 --> 01:42:33.865
Epps, I merely mean to finish
the work at hand, as requested.

01:42:34.023 --> 01:42:35.821
And as paid for.

01:42:35.983 --> 01:42:37.781
If something rubs you wrongly...

01:42:37.943 --> 01:42:40.867
I offer you the opportunity
to speak on it.

01:42:44.116 --> 01:42:46.744
You ask plainly, so I
will tell you plainly.

01:42:47.536 --> 01:42:51.757
What amused me just then was your concern
for my well-being in this heat...

01:42:51.999 --> 01:42:54.969
when, quite frankly, the
condition of your laborers...

01:42:55.127 --> 01:42:56.395
"The condition of my laborers"?

01:42:56.420 --> 01:42:58.422
It is horrid.
It's all wrong.

01:42:58.589 --> 01:42:59.841
All wrong, Mr. Epps.

01:43:00.007 --> 01:43:02.260
They ain't hired help.

01:43:02.426 --> 01:43:03.473
They're my property.

01:43:04.303 --> 01:43:05.304
You say that with pride.

01:43:05.471 --> 01:43:07.144
I say it as fact.

01:43:09.225 --> 01:43:11.899
If this conversation
concerns what is factual

01:43:12.019 --> 01:43:14.693
and what is not,
then it must be said...

01:43:14.855 --> 01:43:17.984
that there is no justice nor
righteousness in their slavery.

01:43:18.818 --> 01:43:20.946
But you do open up
an interesting question.

01:43:22.113 --> 01:43:23.535
What right have
you to your niggers,

01:43:23.656 --> 01:43:25.033
when you come down to the point?

01:43:25.449 --> 01:43:26.746
What right?
Mmm.

01:43:27.368 --> 01:43:30.212
I bought them.
I paid for them.

01:43:30.579 --> 01:43:32.331
Of course you did,
and the law says

01:43:32.456 --> 01:43:34.254
you have the right
to hold a nigger.

01:43:34.417 --> 01:43:36.385
But begging
the law's pardon, it lies.

01:43:37.002 --> 01:43:39.050
Suppose they pass
a law taking away

01:43:39.171 --> 01:43:41.219
your liberty,
making you a slave.

01:43:41.382 --> 01:43:42.508
Suppose.

01:43:42.675 --> 01:43:44.302
That ain't a supposable case.

01:43:44.468 --> 01:43:45.890
Laws change, Epps.

01:43:46.053 --> 01:43:48.147
Universal truths are constant.

01:43:48.305 --> 01:43:51.149
It is a fact,
a plain and simple fact...

01:43:51.308 --> 01:43:54.528
that what is true and right
is true and right for all.

01:43:54.687 --> 01:43:56.689
White and black alike.

01:43:58.315 --> 01:44:00.158
You comparing me
to a nigger, Bass?

01:44:00.317 --> 01:44:03.161
I'm only asking, in the eyes of
God, what is the difference?

01:44:05.156 --> 01:44:06.924
You might as well ask
what the difference is

01:44:06.949 --> 01:44:09.327
between a white man
and a baboon.

01:44:10.536 --> 01:44:13.335
I seen one of them
critters in Orleans.

01:44:13.497 --> 01:44:15.875
Know just as much
as any nigger I got.

01:44:16.167 --> 01:44:17.840
Listen, Epps.

01:44:18.002 --> 01:44:19.675
These niggers are human beings.

01:44:19.837 --> 01:44:22.197
If they are allowed to climb no
higher than brute animals...

01:44:22.339 --> 01:44:25.013
you and men like you
will have to answer for it.

01:44:26.010 --> 01:44:28.183
There is an ill,
Mr. Epps...

01:44:28.345 --> 01:44:30.723
a fearful ill
resting upon this nation.

01:44:31.348 --> 01:44:34.352
And there will be
a day of reckoning yet.

01:44:36.937 --> 01:44:39.611
You like to hear
yourself talk, Bass...

01:44:39.774 --> 01:44:41.868
better than any man I know of.

01:44:42.943 --> 01:44:46.618
You'd argue that black was
white, or white, black...

01:44:46.781 --> 01:44:49.034
if anybody would contradict you.

01:44:51.035 --> 01:44:54.414
A fine supposition if you lived
among Yankees in New England.

01:44:54.580 --> 01:44:56.253
But you don't.

01:44:59.710 --> 01:45:01.883
You most assuredly do not.

01:45:27.404 --> 01:45:29.782
I knew it, I knew it, I knew it!

01:45:32.159 --> 01:45:33.581
Patsey!

01:45:35.579 --> 01:45:36.956
Pats!

01:45:37.665 --> 01:45:39.087
Where is she?

01:45:39.834 --> 01:45:41.256
Where's Pats?

01:45:41.418 --> 01:45:43.762
Where is she, damn it?
Where is she?

01:45:45.714 --> 01:45:48.593
Phebs, where is she? Where is Patsey?
Where is she?

01:45:48.759 --> 01:45:50.056
What you standing there for?

01:45:50.219 --> 01:45:51.459
We know nothing of her, Master.

01:45:51.470 --> 01:45:52.892
Know nothing of what?
We know nothing of...

01:45:53.055 --> 01:45:55.433
Of what?
Where has she gone?

01:45:55.599 --> 01:45:56.600
She run off, ain't she?

01:45:56.767 --> 01:45:57.768
I don't know, Master.

01:45:57.935 --> 01:45:59.482
Where is she?
I don't know, Master.

01:45:59.645 --> 01:46:02.615
You know, you know, you know!

01:46:02.773 --> 01:46:03.615
You know!

01:46:03.774 --> 01:46:05.447
No, I don't!

01:46:07.611 --> 01:46:09.659
You miserable black dogs.

01:46:09.822 --> 01:46:12.291
You stand like
the deaf and dumb.

01:46:14.076 --> 01:46:15.453
Speak!

01:46:30.634 --> 01:46:32.307
She gone.

01:46:34.680 --> 01:46:36.648
My Pats is gone.

01:46:53.532 --> 01:46:55.500
Run off?
Run off, did you?

01:46:55.659 --> 01:46:57.659
Master Epps... You miserable wench.
Where you been?

01:46:57.786 --> 01:46:59.163
I been nowhere!

01:46:59.330 --> 01:47:00.422
Lies to your misdeeds!

01:47:00.581 --> 01:47:01.932
The Sabbath day, Master.
I took me

01:47:01.957 --> 01:47:03.309
a walk to commune with the Lord.

01:47:03.334 --> 01:47:04.768
Bring the Lord
into your deceptions?

01:47:04.793 --> 01:47:06.270
You're coming from
Shaw's plantation.

01:47:06.295 --> 01:47:07.592
No!
Master Epps.

01:47:08.130 --> 01:47:09.131
Now, you speak?

01:47:09.298 --> 01:47:11.346
Now that you want to add to her
lies, you find your tongue!

01:47:11.508 --> 01:47:13.819
I went to Master
Shaw's plantation.

01:47:13.844 --> 01:47:15.346
Ah! You admit it.

01:47:15.679 --> 01:47:16.976
Yes, freely.

01:47:17.139 --> 01:47:18.982
And you know why?

01:47:19.141 --> 01:47:21.690
I got this from Mistress Shaw.

01:47:22.186 --> 01:47:26.191
Mistress Epps won't even grant
me no soap to clean with.

01:47:26.774 --> 01:47:30.369
I stink so much,
I make myself gag!

01:47:33.614 --> 01:47:36.868
500 pounds of cotton.

01:47:37.034 --> 01:47:39.036
Day in, day out!

01:47:39.203 --> 01:47:41.046
More than any man here.

01:47:41.205 --> 01:47:43.299
And for that, I will be clean.

01:47:43.457 --> 01:47:45.175
That's all I ask.

01:47:45.334 --> 01:47:48.383
This, here,
what I went to Shaw's for.

01:47:49.838 --> 01:47:50.885
Liar.

01:47:51.048 --> 01:47:54.643
The Lord knows that's all!

01:47:54.802 --> 01:47:55.724
You're a liar.

01:47:55.886 --> 01:47:59.311
And you, blind with
your own covetousness!

01:48:00.182 --> 01:48:02.310
I don't lie, Master.

01:48:02.810 --> 01:48:06.064
If you kill me,
I'll stick to that.

01:48:06.814 --> 01:48:08.407
I'll fetch you down.

01:48:09.233 --> 01:48:11.281
I'll learn you to go to Shaw's.

01:48:11.735 --> 01:48:12.827
Treach.

01:48:14.863 --> 01:48:16.365
Run and fetch some line.

01:48:16.532 --> 01:48:17.704
Edward!

01:48:19.326 --> 01:48:22.330
Strip her. Strike her bare
and lash her to the post.

01:48:40.764 --> 01:48:42.908
You done this to yourself, Pats.

01:48:54.611 --> 01:48:55.783
Do it.

01:49:00.868 --> 01:49:03.087
Strike the life from her.

01:49:09.293 --> 01:49:10.715
Beat her.

01:49:12.337 --> 01:49:14.590
Give her the whip!
Give it all to her!

01:49:15.883 --> 01:49:18.853
Platt, you come here
and you beat her now.

01:49:21.305 --> 01:49:22.397
Platt!

01:49:25.184 --> 01:49:26.436
Come here!

01:49:28.187 --> 01:49:30.360
I'd rather it you, Platt!

01:49:31.315 --> 01:49:33.067
You strike her.

01:49:33.942 --> 01:49:35.364
Strike her.

01:49:57.674 --> 01:49:59.267
He pantomimes.

01:49:59.885 --> 01:50:02.308
There's barely a welt on her.

01:50:02.763 --> 01:50:05.141
That's what your
niggers make of you...

01:50:05.307 --> 01:50:07.480
a fool for the taking.

01:50:11.980 --> 01:50:14.403
Strike her, Platt.
Strike her!

01:50:31.125 --> 01:50:32.547
You will strike her.

01:50:32.709 --> 01:50:34.427
You will strike
her until her flesh

01:50:34.545 --> 01:50:36.263
is rent and meat and
blood flow equal...

01:50:36.421 --> 01:50:39.220
or I will kill every
nigger in my sight.

01:50:39.383 --> 01:50:40.885
You understand me?

01:50:41.051 --> 01:50:43.895
Strike her! Strike her!

01:51:27.139 --> 01:51:29.938
Until I say no more.
I ain't said nothing!

01:51:39.860 --> 01:51:41.157
Give me the whip!

01:51:42.154 --> 01:51:43.371
Get up!

01:52:02.799 --> 01:52:04.472
Thou devil!

01:52:07.012 --> 01:52:08.559
Sooner or later...

01:52:09.223 --> 01:52:11.817
somewhere in
the course of eternal

01:52:11.975 --> 01:52:14.569
justice, thou shalt
answer for this sin!

01:52:19.983 --> 01:52:23.032
Sin? There is no sin.

01:52:24.488 --> 01:52:27.412
Man does how he pleases
with his property.

01:52:33.038 --> 01:52:36.759
At the moment, Platt,
I'm of great pleasure.

01:52:36.917 --> 01:52:38.760
You be goddamn
careful I don't want to

01:52:38.877 --> 01:52:40.675
come and lighten
my mood no further.

01:54:58.975 --> 01:55:00.477
Master Bass.

01:55:00.769 --> 01:55:03.943
I want to ask you what part
of the country you come from.

01:55:05.148 --> 01:55:07.025
No part of this land.

01:55:08.110 --> 01:55:10.158
I originate from Canada.

01:55:11.154 --> 01:55:12.701
Now, guess where that is.

01:55:12.864 --> 01:55:14.787
I know where Canada is.

01:55:15.617 --> 01:55:17.369
I've been there myself.

01:55:22.290 --> 01:55:24.133
Montreal...

01:55:24.292 --> 01:55:27.341
and Kingston and Queenston
and a great many places.

01:55:27.504 --> 01:55:29.347
Well-traveled for a slave.

01:55:29.506 --> 01:55:30.553
How came you here?

01:55:32.634 --> 01:55:34.307
Master Bass...

01:55:36.638 --> 01:55:40.017
if justice had been done,
I never would have been here.

01:55:44.813 --> 01:55:46.156
How's this?

01:55:47.190 --> 01:55:48.237
Tell me all.

01:55:53.697 --> 01:55:55.870
I'm afraid to tell you.

01:55:57.534 --> 01:56:00.663
Every word you speak
is a profound secret.

01:56:08.211 --> 01:56:09.884
Your story...

01:56:10.547 --> 01:56:12.015
it is amazing.

01:56:12.174 --> 01:56:14.176
And in no good way.

01:56:18.930 --> 01:56:22.560
Do you believe, sir,
in justice, as you said?

01:56:23.727 --> 01:56:25.274
I do.

01:56:25.437 --> 01:56:29.237
That slavery is an evil
that should befall none?

01:56:32.068 --> 01:56:33.866
I believe so.

01:56:34.029 --> 01:56:35.952
If you truly do...

01:56:37.741 --> 01:56:40.790
then I ask, I beg...

01:56:43.455 --> 01:56:46.254
that you write my friends
in the north...

01:56:46.625 --> 01:56:49.424
acquainting them
of my situation...

01:56:50.795 --> 01:56:55.096
and beseeching them
to forward free papers.

01:57:00.096 --> 01:57:01.769
It would be...

01:57:04.768 --> 01:57:07.612
an unspeakable happiness...

01:57:09.231 --> 01:57:11.279
to see my wife...

01:57:13.777 --> 01:57:16.075
and my family again.

01:57:21.952 --> 01:57:25.331
I traveled this country for
the best part of 20 years...

01:57:25.997 --> 01:57:28.921
and my freedom is everything.

01:57:29.084 --> 01:57:33.430
The fact that I can walk out of here
tomorrow brings me great pleasure.

01:57:36.049 --> 01:57:38.302
My life doesn't
mean much to anyone.

01:57:39.636 --> 01:57:43.311
It seems yours might mean a
lot to a whole lot of people.

01:57:45.058 --> 01:57:49.529
But what you ask of me,
sir, scares me.

01:57:51.690 --> 01:57:54.534
And I must say, I am afraid.

01:57:55.652 --> 01:57:57.996
Not just for you, but for me.

01:58:07.163 --> 01:58:09.336
I will write your letter, sir.

01:58:09.780 --> 01:58:11.101
And if it brings you
your freedom,

01:58:11.126 --> 01:58:12.366
it will be more than a pleasure.

01:58:12.377 --> 01:58:14.345
It will have been my duty.

01:58:14.504 --> 01:58:17.508
Now, would you kindly
hand me those shingles?

02:00:52.078 --> 02:00:53.250
Platt!

02:00:53.663 --> 02:00:55.711
Where's the boy called Platt?

02:00:59.002 --> 02:01:00.379
Come here, boy.

02:01:22.525 --> 02:01:24.277
Your name is Platt, is it?

02:01:26.070 --> 02:01:27.367
Yes, sir.

02:01:28.031 --> 02:01:29.578
You know that man?

02:01:47.383 --> 02:01:48.976
Mr. Parker.

02:01:49.636 --> 02:01:51.138
Say again?

02:01:53.181 --> 02:01:55.024
Mr. Parker.

02:01:55.475 --> 02:01:58.149
That man received a letter
compiling many accusations.

02:01:58.311 --> 02:02:00.154
You look me in the eye...

02:02:00.814 --> 02:02:02.540
and on your life,
you answer me truthfully.

02:02:02.565 --> 02:02:04.238
Have you any
other name than Platt?

02:02:04.400 --> 02:02:06.402
Solomon Northup is my name.

02:02:06.569 --> 02:02:07.769
Sheriff, what's all this?

02:02:07.904 --> 02:02:09.281
It's official business.

02:02:09.447 --> 02:02:10.744
My nigger, my business.

02:02:10.907 --> 02:02:12.534
Your business waits.

02:02:12.700 --> 02:02:13.792
Tell me of your family.

02:02:14.118 --> 02:02:15.540
I have a wife, two children.

02:02:15.703 --> 02:02:16.579
What the hell?

02:02:16.704 --> 02:02:18.515
What are your children's names?
Margaret and Alonzo.

02:02:18.540 --> 02:02:19.891
What was your wife's name
before her marriage?

02:02:19.916 --> 02:02:21.418
Anne Hampton.
I am who I say.

02:02:21.584 --> 02:02:22.585
Where you going, Platt?

02:02:23.461 --> 02:02:25.381
Who authorized you
to interfere with my property?

02:02:25.505 --> 02:02:26.597
My authority.

02:02:26.756 --> 02:02:28.099
Platt, you come
back here. Platt!

02:02:28.800 --> 02:02:29.926
You come back here, boy.

02:02:30.927 --> 02:02:32.099
Boy.

02:02:34.556 --> 02:02:36.979
You unhand him.
Platt is my nigger!

02:02:37.141 --> 02:02:38.563
He is
Mr. Solomon Northup.

02:02:38.726 --> 02:02:39.602
You say.

02:02:39.769 --> 02:02:42.238
You come here, unfamiliar
to me, and make claims.

02:02:42.397 --> 02:02:44.123
I got no doubts. The man
is Solomon Northup.

02:02:44.148 --> 02:02:46.492
The hell he is! He's my nigger,
and I'll fight you for him!

02:02:46.651 --> 02:02:47.948
As is your right.

02:02:48.111 --> 02:02:50.312
As it will be my pleasure to
bankrupt you in the courts.

02:02:50.446 --> 02:02:52.790
Your decision.
Unhand him.

02:02:53.573 --> 02:02:55.134
I know you had some
hand in this, Platt.

02:02:55.159 --> 02:02:56.627
I'm gonna get to
the bottom of it.

02:02:56.786 --> 02:02:57.912
Pay him no mind.

02:02:58.079 --> 02:02:59.456
I paid good money
for this nigger.

02:02:59.581 --> 02:03:00.958
Courthouse got
papers to prove it!

02:03:01.124 --> 02:03:02.922
And we got papers
proving he's free!

02:03:03.084 --> 02:03:04.802
I own you. You belong to me.
You hear me, Platt?

02:03:04.961 --> 02:03:06.087
Unhand him!

02:03:06.254 --> 02:03:08.473
You'll have 200 stripes
across your back by sundown!

02:03:08.631 --> 02:03:09.757
Platt!

02:03:09.966 --> 02:03:11.809
Get my horse, Treach.

02:03:20.935 --> 02:03:22.152
Get away from him, Pats.

02:03:23.479 --> 02:03:25.322
I'm gonna be
seeing you real soon.

02:03:25.481 --> 02:03:27.449
Solomon, we need to make haste.

02:03:29.152 --> 02:03:30.153
No.

02:03:30.737 --> 02:03:32.080
Solomon.

02:05:09.002 --> 02:05:11.175
I'll apologize...

02:05:13.256 --> 02:05:15.258
for my appearance.

02:05:17.844 --> 02:05:19.767
But I have had...

02:05:20.722 --> 02:05:22.690
a difficult time...

02:05:23.683 --> 02:05:26.402
these past several years.

02:05:31.274 --> 02:05:32.617
Margaret.

02:05:38.197 --> 02:05:39.915
Alonzo.

02:06:11.064 --> 02:06:12.782
Who is this?

02:06:13.816 --> 02:06:15.818
He's my husband.

02:06:17.320 --> 02:06:18.492
Husband.

02:06:19.322 --> 02:06:22.667
It is very good
to meet you, sir.

02:06:24.452 --> 02:06:26.671
We have much acquainting to do.

02:06:26.829 --> 02:06:28.172
Yes, sir.

02:06:29.415 --> 02:06:33.465
And this is your grandson.

02:06:34.295 --> 02:06:37.469
Solomon Northup Staunton.

02:06:47.683 --> 02:06:49.276
Solomon.

02:06:55.525 --> 02:06:56.822
Anne...

02:06:59.195 --> 02:07:00.993
forgive me.

02:07:04.534 --> 02:07:08.038
There is nothing to forgive.

02:11:39.350 --> 02:11:42.775
<i>Went down to the River Jordan</i>

02:11:42.937 --> 02:11:46.111
<i>Where John baptized three</i>

02:11:46.273 --> 02:11:49.277
<i>When I woke the devil in hell</i>

02:11:49.443 --> 02:11:52.242
<i>Said Johnny baptized me</i>

02:11:52.405 --> 02:11:55.875
<i>I said roll, Jordan, roll</i>

02:11:56.367 --> 02:11:58.916
<i>Roll, Jordan, roll</i>

02:11:59.078 --> 02:12:02.048
<i>My soul will
rise in heaven, Lord</i>

02:12:02.206 --> 02:12:04.800
<i>For the year when Jordan roll</i>

02:12:04.959 --> 02:12:08.338
<i>Well, some say
John was a Baptist</i>

02:12:08.504 --> 02:12:11.098
<i>Some say John was a Jew</i>

02:12:11.257 --> 02:12:13.635
<i>But I say John was a preacher</i>

02:12:13.801 --> 02:12:16.771
<i>'Cause my Bible says so too</i>

02:12:16.929 --> 02:12:20.433
<i>I said roll, Jordan, roll</i>

02:12:20.599 --> 02:12:23.102
<i>Roll, Jordan, roll</i>

02:12:23.269 --> 02:12:26.273
<i>My soul will
rise in heaven, Lord</i>

02:12:26.439 --> 02:12:28.191
<i>For the year when Jordan roll</i>

02:12:28.357 --> 02:12:29.734
<i>Hallelujah</i>

02:12:29.900 --> 02:12:35.407
<i>Roll, Jordan, roll</i>

02:12:35.573 --> 02:12:38.668
<i>My soul will
rise in heaven, Lord</i>

02:12:38.826 --> 02:12:40.669
<i>For the year when Jordan roll</i>

02:12:40.828 --> 02:12:42.045
<i>Oh, roll now</i>

02:12:42.204 --> 02:12:47.768
<i>Roll, Jordan, roll</i>

02:12:47.793 --> 02:12:50.888
<i>My soul will
rise in heaven, Lord</i>

02:12:51.046 --> 02:12:52.857
<i>For the year when Jordan roll</i>

02:12:52.882 --> 02:12:54.275
<i>Halleluiah</i>

02:12:54.300 --> 02:12:59.773
<i>Roll, Jordan, roll</i>

02:12:59.930 --> 02:13:02.900
<i>My soul will
rise in heaven, Lord</i>

02:13:03.058 --> 02:13:04.981
<i>For the year when Jordan roll</i>

02:13:05.144 --> 02:13:06.270
<i>Everybody say</i>

02:13:06.437 --> 02:13:09.236
<i>Roll, Jordan, roll</i>

02:13:09.648 --> 02:13:12.242

<i>For the year when Jordan roll</i>

02:13:17.698 --> 02:13:19.041
<i>Oh, children</i>

02:13:19.200 --> 02:13:24.627
<i>Roll, Jordan, roll</i>

02:13:24.788 --> 02:13:27.667
<i>My soul will
rise in heaven, Lord</i>

02:13:27.833 --> 02:13:29.852

<i>Halleluiah</i>

02:13:31.337 --> 02:13:33.590
