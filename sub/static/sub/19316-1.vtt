00:43.210 --> 00:47.113
Clementine? What are
you doing up here?

00:48.630 --> 00:51.489
I wanted to get a better
look at the Northern Lights,

00:51.491 --> 00:53.172
to see how bad
things really are.

00:53.174 --> 00:55.698
Worse than you can imagine.

01:00.276 --> 01:03.709
I'm afraid Christmas
is in serious trouble.

01:03.711 --> 01:05.930
So, what can we do?

01:05.932 --> 01:10.308
When you figure that out,
be sure and let me know.

01:26.969 --> 01:29.729
Kevin, you're the man of the house.

01:29.731 --> 01:32.556
Are these for the Christmas
lights or the router?

01:32.558 --> 01:35.721
Actually, they're what's
left of your old hairdryer.

01:35.724 --> 01:39.055
I saw a video on Edison.
I got inspired.

01:39.057 --> 01:41.242
OK, that's the last time
I skimp on movers.

01:41.244 --> 01:42.791
Everything is mislabelled!

01:42.793 --> 01:44.912
Oh! Nice T-Rex!

01:44.914 --> 01:48.682
It's a reindeer, but if you
see a T-Rex, let's go with that.

01:48.684 --> 01:50.029
Oh, pragmatic artist.

01:50.030 --> 01:52.351
Guess you got the best
of both parents.

01:52.353 --> 01:54.504
Oh, honey!
We gotta leave in 10 minutes!

01:54.506 --> 01:56.289
You're gonna be late for school.

01:56.291 --> 01:58.241
I'm not sure
anybody would notice.

01:58.243 --> 01:59.588
Oh, Kev, come on!

01:59.590 --> 02:01.843
Look, I know one of
the hardest things to do

02:01.845 --> 02:03.728
is to fit into a new school,

02:03.730 --> 02:05.580
but it just takes
time, you'll see.

02:07.264 --> 02:08.777
Oh, that's my editor.

02:08.780 --> 02:11.538
He wants to see me
in the office. Come on!

02:11.540 --> 02:14.905
Probably just to tell you
you're his awesomest reporter.

02:15.950 --> 02:17.294
You're awesome!

02:17.297 --> 02:19.684
You've always been
my biggest fan. Thank you.

02:19.686 --> 02:22.546
Mom, what if Santa looks
for us at the old house

02:22.548 --> 02:25.373
and all he sees are empty rooms?

02:25.375 --> 02:27.527
Honey, if he can
deliver a billion presents

02:27.529 --> 02:28.672
in a single night,

02:28.674 --> 02:30.187
he's gotta have
some sort of system

02:30.189 --> 02:32.207
that can track all
of us, don't you think?

02:33.926 --> 02:37.491
Come on, let's go.

02:37.493 --> 02:39.848
How is it in the making-
friends department, huh?

02:39.850 --> 02:41.026
Tommy Chan said sorry

02:41.028 --> 02:43.181
when he tripped
on my backpack yesterday.

02:43.183 --> 02:44.831
See? That's something, right?

02:44.833 --> 02:46.546
Seriously?

02:46.548 --> 02:51.697
OK, maybe not, but you've
got to keep trying, OK?

02:51.699 --> 02:53.650
Oh, I have an idea!

02:53.652 --> 02:56.949
Why don't you think about
maybe joining a team or a club

02:56.951 --> 02:58.328
or something like that?

02:58.330 --> 03:00.313
Well, I was thinking
of starting, like,

03:00.315 --> 03:01.459
a Christmas committee

03:01.461 --> 03:03.545
to put up more lights
and stuff at school.

03:03.547 --> 03:05.533
That's a great idea!

03:05.535 --> 03:07.214
Come on!

03:13.175 --> 03:16.068
Lights and decorations tonight!
Promise?

03:16.070 --> 03:19.771
Promise, if we have to tear
through every box in the house.

03:19.773 --> 03:22.833
Great, 'cause the only time
you see green and red

03:22.835 --> 03:23.911
around this place

03:23.913 --> 03:26.201
is when the 6th graders
dissect frogs.

03:26.203 --> 03:29.062
Eww! Gross!
But I get the point.

03:38.152 --> 03:40.001
Top of the mornin', Kev!

03:40.003 --> 03:41.315
Hey!

03:43.976 --> 03:45.793
Who rides a bike in the winter?

03:45.795 --> 03:47.643
Mom, this is my teacher, Mr. Wilson.

03:47.645 --> 03:49.966
Hi, I'm Ryan.

03:49.968 --> 03:54.106
Chelsea! I didn't realize
Kevin's teacher was Irish.

03:54.108 --> 03:55.217
Oh, I'm not, actually.

03:55.219 --> 03:57.809
I just like to keep
the kids on their toes!

03:58.518 --> 04:00.165
Nice to meet you.

04:00.167 --> 04:01.310
Yeah!

04:01.312 --> 04:04.643
Your teacher is unique.

04:04.645 --> 04:06.055
Yeah! I like him.

04:06.057 --> 04:08.783
He gets you to
see things differently.

04:08.785 --> 04:11.206
Kiss for Mom?

04:11.208 --> 04:13.900
No? I love you!

04:16.392 --> 04:20.127
Come on, buddy.
Talk to somebody.

04:31.675 --> 04:33.559
Uh, better make room
by the crossword.

04:33.561 --> 04:36.722
There's something strange going
on with the Northern Lights.

04:36.724 --> 04:38.002
Morning, Trevor!

04:38.004 --> 04:39.011
Morning.

04:39.013 --> 04:40.291
Hey, Chuck!

04:40.293 --> 04:42.209
Nice piece on the bus strike!

04:42.211 --> 04:43.488
Thanks, Chelsea!

04:43.490 --> 04:44.498
Yeah!

04:44.500 --> 04:46.047
Hey, you want some eggnog?

04:46.049 --> 04:48.875
No, actually, eggnog and I
are not friends, so you enjoy!

04:48.877 --> 04:49.985
Right choice!

04:49.988 --> 04:51.837
Avoiding Chuck
in Christmas-party mode

04:51.839 --> 04:54.665
is the best advice this advice
columnist could give you.

04:54.667 --> 04:57.323
Listen, maybe you
and I could have lunch today?

04:57.325 --> 05:00.050
If that means joining you
at your desk for a sandwich

05:00.052 --> 05:02.037
from the vending
machine, no thanks!

05:02.039 --> 05:04.056
I'm sorry.
New-kid syndrome!

05:04.058 --> 05:06.682
I feel like I have to prove
myself to the higher-ups.

05:06.684 --> 05:08.331
Well, here's your chance!
Oh!

05:08.334 --> 05:09.611
Morning, Chelsea!

05:09.613 --> 05:11.091
I was just coming to see you!

05:11.093 --> 05:12.674
Good, good! Walk with me.
OK.

05:12.676 --> 05:14.391
I've decided to
shake things up

05:14.393 --> 05:16.512
and try you out on
the "City Beat" column.

05:16.514 --> 05:18.195
Really? Oh,
I won't let you down!

05:18.197 --> 05:20.315
I know! Back in Wisconsin,
you were the one

05:20.317 --> 05:22.099
who broke the story
on the wholesaler

05:22.101 --> 05:24.792
who was selling cheap cheddar
as gourmet Gouda, right?

05:24.794 --> 05:27.013
Yeah, well, I have
a nose for news,

05:27.015 --> 05:29.067
and that didn't smell right.

05:29.069 --> 05:32.030
Put that wit and tenacity in
your column, and you'll do fine.

05:32.032 --> 05:33.274
Your first assignment.

05:33.276 --> 05:35.463
The town canceled the
Christmas-tree lighting

05:35.465 --> 05:36.439
in Greenwood Park

05:36.441 --> 05:37.583
to save a few bucks.

05:37.585 --> 05:38.964
Think you can you handle

05:38.966 --> 05:41.454
a "politician
turned Scrooge" story?

05:41.456 --> 05:43.407
Yeah, of course!
Um, should I...

05:44.451 --> 05:46.067
OK!

06:08.183 --> 06:09.327
Mr. Finster?
Yes!

06:09.329 --> 06:11.010
Chelsea Hastings
from <i> The Examiner.</i>

06:11.012 --> 06:13.231
I called you about the
tree-lighting ceremony.

06:13.233 --> 06:15.285
I'm sorry, we're
closed for the holidays.

06:15.287 --> 06:18.146
Doesn't the public deserve
to know why it was canceled?

06:18.148 --> 06:19.594
Ms. Hastings, right?
Yeah.

06:19.596 --> 06:22.219
The ceremony's expensive.
Power, labour, liability.

06:22.221 --> 06:23.465
The mayor made a decision.

06:23.467 --> 06:24.980
It's a tradition around here!

06:24.982 --> 06:27.371
A tradition that seems
to have been forgotten.

06:27.373 --> 06:28.648
If you have any questions,

06:28.650 --> 06:30.063
talk to the mayor's office...

06:30.065 --> 06:31.511
or the planning commission!

06:31.513 --> 06:33.899
What do they have to do
with the tree lighting?

06:33.901 --> 06:35.314
More than you might think,

06:35.316 --> 06:37.031
but you didn't hear it from me!

06:40.634 --> 06:43.965
Yes, he said
the planning commission,

06:43.967 --> 06:46.153
which, of course,
is conveniently closed

06:46.155 --> 06:47.197
for the holidays.

06:47.199 --> 06:48.628
I'm telling you, Jasmine,

06:48.630 --> 06:51.391
there's more to this story
than meets the eye.

06:51.393 --> 06:54.452
Mm-hmm! Listen, I gotta go.
I gotta pick up my kid.

06:54.454 --> 06:55.751
I'll call you later.

06:57.017 --> 07:00.510
So, to sum up
from the textbook,

07:00.512 --> 07:03.439
"fractions are
numerical quantities,

07:03.441 --> 07:06.768
"when added together,
comprise the whole."

07:06.770 --> 07:08.965
Confused?

07:08.967 --> 07:09.964
I know I am.

07:10.964 --> 07:12.261
All right, let's see

07:12.263 --> 07:14.291
if we can make this
a little clearer.

07:15.558 --> 07:20.581
Suppose we took these
scissors to this tie

07:20.583 --> 07:24.710
and made the tie
a fraction of its length.

07:28.106 --> 07:30.213
I'd say that's
about half, right?

07:30.215 --> 07:33.995
So, if I took it and cut
right here, it would be...

07:33.997 --> 07:35.635
All together now!

07:35.637 --> 07:37.208
One fourth!

07:37.210 --> 07:39.584
By George,
I think they've got it!

07:42.498 --> 07:44.136
All right, so, remember,

07:44.138 --> 07:46.647
Christmas vacation
starts next week,

07:46.649 --> 07:50.697
so you have exactly 2 days
to pick your holiday project.

07:50.699 --> 07:53.206
It can be an experiment
or a paper

07:53.208 --> 07:55.282
or a plan to change the world!

07:55.284 --> 07:57.859
Think bold!
Think big, people!

07:58.931 --> 08:00.871
Hey! Nice to see you again.

08:00.873 --> 08:04.888
Thanks! That was an
interesting demonstration.

08:04.890 --> 08:07.264
Yeah, well, anything
to get the point across.

08:07.266 --> 08:09.540
What is the point of
the holiday project?

08:09.542 --> 08:12.519
My mom's a reporter.
She was born to ask questions.

08:12.521 --> 08:14.896
It's OK. The point
of the project

08:14.898 --> 08:16.737
is to teach the kids
creative thinking.

08:16.739 --> 08:19.213
Well, I think your
creative approach to math

08:19.215 --> 08:22.025
has turned your $20 tie into
a penny worth of scraps.

08:22.027 --> 08:25.740
Well, you obviously don't
write for the style section,

08:25.742 --> 08:26.978
'cause it was a $6 tie!

08:26.980 --> 08:29.120
Oh!

08:36.818 --> 08:38.894
Tell me it went better today.

08:38.895 --> 08:41.236
Today was better.
Really?

08:41.238 --> 08:43.578
No! But you told
me what to say.

08:43.581 --> 08:44.952
Spill it.

08:44.954 --> 08:46.190
OK.

08:46.192 --> 08:48.165
This reindeer sweater, bad idea.

08:48.167 --> 08:50.273
(♪ Choir singing
<i>The First Noel</i> on radio ♪

08:50.275 --> 08:53.018
I also heard a nasty rumour
from the lunch lady

08:53.020 --> 08:55.829
that the town's tree-lighting
ceremony was canceled!

08:55.831 --> 08:58.641
Yeah, I'm actually writing
an article about it.

08:58.643 --> 09:00.147
I was gonna tell you today.

09:00.149 --> 09:02.390
So it's true?

09:02.392 --> 09:04.800
Remember back home,

09:04.802 --> 09:07.210
the tree-lighting ceremony
in Nelson Square?

09:07.212 --> 09:10.021
Practically the whole
town got together!

09:10.023 --> 09:11.259
Yeah.

09:11.261 --> 09:13.937
I really miss all that.

09:13.939 --> 09:15.476
Yeah, I know, buddy.

09:15.478 --> 09:16.448
Me too.

09:16.450 --> 09:17.652
But listen,

09:17.654 --> 09:20.463
uh, you know, this place
is into Christmas.

09:20.465 --> 09:21.870
I mean, hey, look!

09:21.872 --> 09:24.615
Look at that inflatable
reindeer right there, right?

09:24.617 --> 09:27.393
He's giving 20% off
for the holidays, huh?

09:27.395 --> 09:29.333
Nice try.

09:34.288 --> 09:37.769
Honey, I'm sorry we couldn't
find the box of decorations,

09:37.771 --> 09:39.943
but we'll keep
looking tomorrow, OK?

09:39.945 --> 09:42.587
It's OK.
Good night, Mom!

09:42.589 --> 09:43.859
Good night, honey.

09:43.861 --> 09:51.796
Sleep tight!

10:16.260 --> 10:20.075
Now, that was Christmas!

10:27.406 --> 10:29.847
Clementine!
There you are!

10:29.849 --> 10:32.325
I've been looking
all over for you!

10:32.327 --> 10:33.864
I'm really worried, Mom.

10:33.866 --> 10:36.810
Things are way worse
than people realize.

10:36.812 --> 10:38.484
Just look at the ornaments!

10:38.486 --> 10:41.261
There's one for every kid
in the world, right?

10:41.263 --> 10:44.441
So we should easily be able
to read by their glow!

10:44.443 --> 10:46.149
But they're totally dim!

10:46.151 --> 10:49.495
I have to admit,
I've never seen it so dark.

10:49.497 --> 10:52.742
So someone has
to do something now,

10:52.744 --> 10:54.115
before it's too late!

10:54.117 --> 10:56.926
I hope by "someone,"
you don't mean you!

10:56.928 --> 10:58.567
If not me, then who?

10:58.569 --> 11:00.373
Clementine,
that's what you said

11:00.375 --> 11:03.219
before the glacier fiasco
and the snowplow incident.

11:03.221 --> 11:06.699
Hey! I'm a problem solver, and
those roads were very slushy.

11:06.701 --> 11:09.043
Everyone appreciates
your contentions,

11:09.045 --> 11:10.246
but you have to admit

11:10.248 --> 11:13.226
you do have a tendency
to leap before you look.

11:13.228 --> 11:15.937
Hey, focus on your studies.

11:15.939 --> 11:18.413
When you grow up, you can
join the rest of the family

11:18.415 --> 11:19.852
in the Guild of Brain Stretch.

11:19.854 --> 11:21.593
But, Mom, it's just

11:21.595 --> 11:25.811
I feel like I'm meant for
something else, you know?

11:25.813 --> 11:28.287
Something...
something bigger!

11:30.464 --> 11:34.044
Wait... wait a minute!

11:34.046 --> 11:35.986
What's that?

11:35.988 --> 11:39.199
Now, this kid really
gets what it takes

11:39.201 --> 11:41.307
to make Christmas dazzy!

11:44.153 --> 11:47.130
Kevin Hastings.

11:47.132 --> 11:50.478
<i>Why isn't Christmas
like it used to be?</i>

11:50.480 --> 11:53.525
That's exactly what
I've been wondering!

11:53.527 --> 11:56.101
Honey, he can't hear you.

11:57.242 --> 12:00.150
Doesn't matter.
I heard him.

12:02.696 --> 12:04.702
SNO-M-G!

12:05.809 --> 12:07.851
I've got a great idea!

12:10.272 --> 12:11.907
Mom!

12:14.667 --> 12:16.029
Mom!

12:48.295 --> 12:50.881
Whoa! Cool!

12:58.209 --> 13:00.900
Flight 7-Niner-Niner!

13:00.902 --> 13:03.659
<i>You're clear to land
on runway Alpha-Charlie.</i>

13:03.661 --> 13:06.010
<i>Make sure your flaps
and landing gear are down.</i>

13:08.465 --> 13:12.210
Whatever you say, Tower,
although, I don't use a runway.

13:13.404 --> 13:15.243
Uh, who is this?

13:15.245 --> 13:17.525
<i>If you don't know
who you're talking to,</i>

13:17.528 --> 13:20.081
<i>then why are you giving
flight instructions?</i>

13:21.309 --> 13:24.988
I was just fooling around.

13:24.990 --> 13:28.019
I know! I'm just
messing with you.

13:28.021 --> 13:30.575
So, you like the present?

13:30.577 --> 13:32.579
Yeah, it's awesome.

13:32.581 --> 13:35.945
It totally turned around
my otherwise crummy month.

13:35.947 --> 13:38.289
<i>If it makes you
feel any better,</i>

13:38.292 --> 13:40.296
<i>you're not the
only one with problems.</i>

13:40.298 --> 13:42.912
Do you wanna talk about it?

13:42.914 --> 13:45.290
Yeah, except my mom will freak

13:45.292 --> 13:49.335
if she catches me talking
to a stranger on the radio.

13:49.337 --> 13:51.579
Well, technically,
it's not a radio.

13:51.581 --> 13:53.482
It's a Northpole communicator.

13:53.484 --> 13:55.283
-<i> North Pole?</i>

13:55.286 --> 13:58.002
Yeah! It's where I live
with my 9 brothers and sisters.

13:58.005 --> 14:00.551
You live at the North Pole?

14:00.553 --> 14:02.557
Oh, not the North Pole.

14:02.559 --> 14:05.479
I actually live in
a city called Northpole.

14:05.481 --> 14:06.873
Name's Clementine.

14:06.875 --> 14:09.761
<i>See? Now we're not
strangers anymore.</i>

14:09.763 --> 14:11.156
<i>Right, Kevin?</i>

14:11.158 --> 14:13.161
How could you...

14:13.163 --> 14:16.084
<i>Now, you tell me about
your lousy month,</i>

14:16.087 --> 14:18.769
and I'll tell you about mine.

14:18.771 --> 14:21.964
No one around here gets me.

14:29.510 --> 14:32.228
<i>We are two of a kind, Kevin.</i>

14:32.230 --> 14:33.960
I mean, where is it written

14:33.962 --> 14:36.509
a small elf can't make
a big difference?

14:38.381 --> 14:41.948
Excuse me? Elf?
Wait a minute.

14:43.344 --> 14:45.891
Hello? Clementine!

14:45.893 --> 14:47.760
Hello!

14:47.762 --> 14:49.594
Kevin!

14:49.596 --> 14:52.689
Hey! Who are
you talking to?

14:52.691 --> 14:55.373
Would you believe an elf?

14:55.375 --> 14:56.460
An elf?

14:56.462 --> 14:58.772
OK, Mister, time for bed.

14:59.896 --> 15:01.695
An elf!

15:08.696 --> 15:10.939
Who needs a gym when
the library's open?

15:12.199 --> 15:15.188
Yeah! Uh, Ryan, right?

15:15.190 --> 15:16.343
Yeah.

15:16.345 --> 15:18.450
Shouldn't you be in school?

15:18.452 --> 15:20.115
The kids have music
class on Tuesday mornings.

15:20.117 --> 15:22.258
It gives me a chance
to do my own homework.

15:22.260 --> 15:23.922
I see. New tie?

15:23.924 --> 15:25.418
Oh yeah!

15:25.420 --> 15:26.777
Yes!

15:26.779 --> 15:28.714
I buy them in bulk
on the Internet.

15:28.716 --> 15:30.652
What brings you down here?

15:30.654 --> 15:33.711
Just doing a little background
work on Greenwood Park

15:33.713 --> 15:35.173
for an article I'm writing.

15:35.175 --> 15:38.196
Of course, the research is
up there, and I'm down here.

15:38.198 --> 15:41.255
You wanna see some
world-class mountaineering?

15:41.257 --> 15:44.008
Think you should
be doing that?

15:44.010 --> 15:45.266
Don't worry!

15:45.268 --> 15:48.733
I spent a summer as
a ranger in Yosemite.

15:48.735 --> 15:49.855
Yeah!

15:49.857 --> 15:51.248
Well, maybe not a ranger,

15:51.250 --> 15:53.831
but I did manage
a concession stand.

15:53.833 --> 15:56.896
Ah! Thank you.

15:59.690 --> 16:01.597
A parenting book, huh?

16:01.599 --> 16:02.891
Everything OK with Kevin?

16:02.893 --> 16:04.935
Oh! Yeah, um...

16:06.197 --> 16:08.375
Well, to tell you the truth,

16:08.377 --> 16:10.316
Kevin hasn't made
any friends here,

16:10.318 --> 16:12.427
and he's been inventing
a lot of stories,

16:12.429 --> 16:14.403
and last night,
he was talking to an elf.

16:16.006 --> 16:18.865
Well, the imagination can
be a great coping mechanism.

16:18.867 --> 16:22.134
Or a way to avoid
facing reality.

16:23.635 --> 16:25.983
Well, look,
I'm sure he will be fine,

16:25.985 --> 16:28.912
but I'm happy to keep
an eye on him at school.

16:28.914 --> 16:30.377
Thanks!

16:32.761 --> 16:34.464
Happy reading!

16:34.466 --> 16:35.588
Hmm!

17:03.789 --> 17:05.933
Hey, Randy!

17:05.935 --> 17:08.760
We've got a big problem
that needs solving.

17:08.762 --> 17:11.859
How about a trip down south?

17:14.688 --> 17:19.557
Wow! Look at you all ribboned
and bowed and ready to fly!

17:19.559 --> 17:21.635
All right!

17:21.637 --> 17:24.973
It's time to get
into the snow zone.

17:36.282 --> 17:37.234
Hey!

17:37.236 --> 17:38.528
Hey!

17:38.530 --> 17:40.400
Well, we might
as well get started.

17:40.402 --> 17:44.353
At least we have 2 people
on the Christmas committee!

17:44.355 --> 17:46.552
Christmas committee?

17:46.554 --> 17:49.124
I thought this was
the gamers group.

17:54.335 --> 17:56.534
Nice Christmas committee!

18:02.456 --> 18:03.707
Hey, honey.

18:03.709 --> 18:05.366
Don't stay up too late, OK?

18:05.368 --> 18:07.024
I won't!

18:07.026 --> 18:08.445
And listen,

18:08.447 --> 18:11.051
I'm sorry your committee
didn't take off,

18:11.053 --> 18:13.621
but I promise we'll have
our own terrific Christmas.

18:13.623 --> 18:15.550
All right.
Good night, Mom!

18:15.552 --> 18:16.869
Good night.

18:20.391 --> 18:22.996
<i>Hey! Kevin!</i>

18:29.122 --> 18:30.372
Clementine?

18:30.374 --> 18:32.098
<i>Sorry I lost
contact last night.</i>

18:32.100 --> 18:33.823
<i>The Northern Lights
are freaking.</i>

18:33.825 --> 18:35.718
<i>We've gotta talk right away.</i>

18:35.720 --> 18:38.628
I don't think
I'm supposed to talk to you.

18:38.630 --> 18:41.911
My mom says you're the product
of an overactive imagination.

18:41.913 --> 18:44.212
-<i> Your imagination's fine.</i>

18:44.214 --> 18:45.767
<i>It's your mom's</i>

18:45.769 --> 18:47.934
<i>and a lot of other people's
underactive imaginations</i>

18:47.936 --> 18:49.354
<i>that are the problem.</i>

18:49.356 --> 18:52.062
<i>I mean, where's the joy?
Where's the happiness?</i>

18:52.064 --> 18:53.415
Good question.

18:53.417 --> 18:54.939
-<i> Glad you think so,</i>

18:54.941 --> 18:58.119
<i>'cause I need you
to find an answer to it</i>

18:58.121 --> 18:59.472
<i>before Northpole's a goner!</i>

18:59.474 --> 19:01.806
Goner? What are
you talking about?

19:01.808 --> 19:04.176
<i>Best way to explain
is to show you.</i>

19:04.178 --> 19:07.559
<i>Put down the communicator,
and look out your window.</i>

19:13.990 --> 19:15.443
No way!

19:20.689 --> 19:22.583
This is so sick!

19:22.585 --> 19:25.358
Yeah, well, I wanted
the one with racing stripes,

19:25.360 --> 19:27.050
but beggars can't be choosers.

19:27.052 --> 19:30.568
Now jump in and buckle up,
'cause we gotta fly!

19:30.570 --> 19:32.700
Uh, fly?

19:32.702 --> 19:36.355
Oh, do you know
a faster way to Northpole?

19:38.962 --> 19:41.161
If my mom finds
out about this,

19:41.163 --> 19:44.409
I'll be in my room until
I'm old enough to vote.

19:46.305 --> 19:48.874
Go like snow, Randy!

19:57.979 --> 20:00.920
OK, I've had
some weird dreams,

20:00.923 --> 20:03.154
but this is the weirdest!

20:03.156 --> 20:04.474
It's not a dream!

20:04.476 --> 20:06.741
This is what I'm
trying to prove to you!

20:06.743 --> 20:08.805
Northpole is for real!

20:09.958 --> 20:12.460
OK, look down there!

20:12.462 --> 20:15.268
Those are some of the
guilds where toys are made.

20:15.270 --> 20:16.994
That's the Guild of Yummy!

20:16.997 --> 20:19.093
And that's the Guild
of Spin and Fly.

20:20.380 --> 20:24.503
Oh, and my favourite,
Reindeer Games Stadium!

20:24.505 --> 20:27.041
This is so cool!

20:27.043 --> 20:31.740
And over there, that's the
Guild of Bounce and Spring.

20:31.742 --> 20:34.580
There's Snow Row.
That's where I live.

20:34.582 --> 20:37.523
And those are Northpole canals.

20:37.525 --> 20:39.146
It's totally awesome!

20:39.148 --> 20:41.749
Yeah, well, we say "dazzy,"

20:41.751 --> 20:43.744
but "awesome" works too.

20:43.746 --> 20:46.484
Oh! You're gonna
have to put these on.

20:46.486 --> 20:48.209
You're not allowed up here,

20:48.211 --> 20:50.136
and I'm in enough
trouble already.

20:50.138 --> 20:52.740
Candy-cane tights?

20:52.742 --> 20:54.398
Yeah!

20:54.400 --> 20:55.544
Green shoes?

20:55.546 --> 20:56.858
Cute, right?

20:56.860 --> 20:59.287
If anybody at school
finds out about this,

20:59.289 --> 21:02.388
I'll be a piñata in,
like, 3 seconds flat!

21:02.390 --> 21:05.423
My town, my rules.

21:07.953 --> 21:10.009
Bring 'er home, Randy!

21:16.047 --> 21:19.519
Whee!

21:19.521 --> 21:23.026
Oh!
That's wonderful!

21:23.028 --> 21:26.026
All right! Come on!
Come on, come on!

21:26.028 --> 21:29.534
Remember, act like an elf.

21:29.536 --> 21:33.311
Ugh! They don't call these
things "tights" for a nothing.

21:33.313 --> 21:34.356
Whee!

21:34.358 --> 21:35.367
Whoo!

21:35.369 --> 21:37.491
This is amazing.

21:37.493 --> 21:39.886
How come they don't
just use the bridge?

21:39.888 --> 21:42.920
Duh! Because
bouncing's more fun!

21:42.922 --> 21:45.213
Makes sense.

21:45.215 --> 21:47.810
Oh! What's up with
the light show?

21:50.475 --> 21:52.092
That's what we need to fix.

21:52.094 --> 21:54.723
If Northpole's gonna survive,
we need somebody

21:54.725 --> 21:58.195
to do something to keep
the cycle of happiness going.

21:58.197 --> 22:01.568
What's the cycle of happiness?

22:01.570 --> 22:05.479
When children down south feel
the joy of holiday togetherness,

22:05.481 --> 22:09.020
sparks of happiness flow up
and become the Northern Lights.

22:09.022 --> 22:11.280
Then they float
back down on Northpole

22:11.282 --> 22:13.066
as magic snowflakes.

22:13.068 --> 22:15.191
And magic snow
powers everything.

22:15.193 --> 22:17.247
It's what the elf
guilds use to make toys,

22:17.249 --> 22:18.596
toys that make kids happy,

22:18.598 --> 22:20.586
and so then the cycle continues

22:20.588 --> 22:23.182
just like it has
for generations.

22:24.599 --> 22:26.555
Until now.

22:44.765 --> 22:50.259
And so less togetherness down
south means less magic snow.

22:50.261 --> 22:52.350
Without some kind of miracle,

22:52.352 --> 22:54.880
the Northern Lights
could go out,

22:54.882 --> 22:57.746
which would be the
end of Northpole.

22:57.748 --> 23:00.274
And the end of all
the toys from Santa!

23:00.276 --> 23:02.736
Oh! Well, now you're
getting the picture!

23:02.738 --> 23:06.344
Man! No toys?

23:12.381 --> 23:14.201
Why am I laughing?

23:14.203 --> 23:17.539
Because getting smacked with
a snowball made of happy moments

23:17.541 --> 23:18.888
makes everybody giggle!

23:21.014 --> 23:24.182
Anyway, now that
you've seen the problem,

23:24.184 --> 23:25.665
we need to get busy.

23:25.667 --> 23:28.498
Uh, we?

23:28.500 --> 23:31.368
Yeah, you and me!

23:31.370 --> 23:33.663
It's up to us to make
the miracle happen.

23:33.665 --> 23:35.723
I don't know about
that, Clementine.

23:35.725 --> 23:38.019
It sounds a little
out of my league.

23:38.021 --> 23:39.504
Clementine!

23:39.506 --> 23:40.989
Oh boy!

23:40.991 --> 23:42.408
My ice is totally cracked.

23:44.569 --> 23:47.337
Santa and
Mrs. Claus?

23:47.339 --> 23:48.956
Kevin Hastings!

23:50.140 --> 23:52.030
You almost had me fooled!

23:52.032 --> 23:54.494
Uh, well, you see,
Clementine...

23:54.496 --> 23:58.647
Does this have anything to
do with my missing reindeer?

23:58.649 --> 24:01.516
Uh-huh! But I've got
a very good excuse.

24:01.518 --> 24:04.285
You see, Kevin and I
are working together

24:04.287 --> 24:05.938
on the happiness problem.

24:05.940 --> 24:08.032
You volunteered, Kevin?

24:08.034 --> 24:09.652
That's nice!

24:09.654 --> 24:13.131
Well, I haven't
exactly volunteered.

24:13.133 --> 24:16.809
I mean, Clementine's
talking miracles here!

24:16.811 --> 24:20.050
I have trouble opening
a jar of pickles!

24:20.052 --> 24:21.906
Well, even
the smallest snowflake

24:21.908 --> 24:24.508
can turn into
the biggest snowball!

24:24.510 --> 24:26.364
If it gets a push.

24:26.366 --> 24:30.517
I know you're worried about me
finding you in your new home,

24:30.519 --> 24:32.340
but if it'll make
you feel better,

24:32.342 --> 24:34.534
you take this magic snowflake,

24:34.536 --> 24:37.235
and we'll find you
no matter where you are.

24:37.237 --> 24:40.274
Wow! Thanks!

24:41.692 --> 24:43.413
Good luck!

24:43.415 --> 24:46.012
Thanks, Mrs. Claus.

24:47.668 --> 24:49.962
So, what do you say?

24:51.686 --> 24:53.574
What else can I say?

24:53.576 --> 24:55.330
I'm in!

24:55.332 --> 24:58.841
Oh, Kevin! You're
the deer's ears!

25:00.296 --> 25:01.983
Now let's get you home.

25:01.985 --> 25:03.806
Come on!

25:06.205 --> 25:09.783
Mom, you're not gonna
believe what happened!

25:09.785 --> 25:12.046
Morning, Bed Head! Whoa!

25:12.048 --> 25:13.936
It was amazing!

25:13.938 --> 25:15.525
First I talked to Clementine!

25:15.527 --> 25:17.652
You made a friend
named Clementine?

25:17.654 --> 25:18.799
Yeah! She's an elf!

25:18.801 --> 25:20.758
You were talking
to an elf again.

25:20.760 --> 25:22.176
Not just talked!

25:22.178 --> 25:26.093
She took me on a flying-
sleigh ride to Northpole!

25:26.095 --> 25:27.512
And I met Santa,

25:27.514 --> 25:32.138
and saw all the guilds where
they make all the toys!

25:32.140 --> 25:34.907
And I was drafted
on a special mission

25:34.909 --> 25:38.216
to help save Northpole
and protect Christmas!

25:38.218 --> 25:40.445
Wow! That was some dream!

25:40.447 --> 25:43.855
That's what I thought at
first, but it wasn't a dream!

25:43.857 --> 25:45.780
Look, I got proof.

25:45.782 --> 25:49.663
Oh, you got the rest of the Christmas decorations!
Great!

25:49.665 --> 25:51.623
No, Santa gave me this himself

25:51.625 --> 25:54.154
so he can find me
no matter where we live!

25:54.156 --> 25:56.180
It's a magic snowflake!

25:56.182 --> 26:00.132
OK, honey, I want you
to listen to me.

26:00.134 --> 26:02.800
I know that this move
hasn't been easy,

26:02.802 --> 26:04.960
but we're gonna get through it,

26:04.962 --> 26:06.548
like we always do,

26:06.550 --> 26:07.898
together.

26:07.900 --> 26:09.485
But, Mom, I...

26:09.487 --> 26:11.173
Honey, go get ready
for school, OK?

26:11.175 --> 26:12.186
Come on!

26:14.316 --> 26:17.421
At least I know what
my class project's gonna be.

26:19.010 --> 26:21.507
Magic snowflake!

26:35.723 --> 26:37.175
Hi!

26:37.177 --> 26:38.696
For the mayor?

26:38.698 --> 26:40.924
Yes, but I have
strict instructions

26:40.926 --> 26:42.510
to deliver it personally.

26:42.512 --> 26:44.638
Oh! Uh, OK.
Just one moment, please.

26:56.391 --> 26:58.549
So, as you guys well know,

26:58.551 --> 27:01.927
we are T-minus 2 days
till Christmas vacation,

27:01.929 --> 27:05.237
which means it's time
to pick your projects.

27:05.239 --> 27:07.431
All right? Now, dazzle me.

27:07.433 --> 27:08.715
Enrique!

27:08.717 --> 27:10.606
My project is
to measure snowfall.

27:10.608 --> 27:12.159
OK, how you gonna do that?

27:12.161 --> 27:13.813
Using my cat's water dish.

27:13.815 --> 27:16.582
Wouldn't you rather
use a beaker?

27:16.584 --> 27:18.676
Pico de Gato won't drink
from a beaker!

27:18.678 --> 27:20.939
OK, moving on!
Andrea, what's yours?

27:20.941 --> 27:23.505
I was inspired by
the Jane Goodall video

27:23.507 --> 27:25.058
we watched last week.

27:25.060 --> 27:27.625
To do a field study
on learned behaviour?

27:27.627 --> 27:28.976
No, a field study

27:28.978 --> 27:31.542
on which of my Christmas
presents cost the most.

27:33.165 --> 27:36.169
OK! Kevin, what's
yours gonna be?

27:36.171 --> 27:40.084
Uh, well, there's been
some really great ideas

27:40.086 --> 27:41.876
floated around here,

27:41.878 --> 27:45.015
and I don't wanna
upstage anybody,

27:45.017 --> 27:46.569
so I'll tell you later.

27:46.571 --> 27:47.853
No, sir. Out with it!

27:47.855 --> 27:49.608
Now, I know you
got something great.

27:49.610 --> 27:51.634
What's your vacation
project gonna be?

27:51.636 --> 27:53.626
I'm gonna save Northpole.

27:53.628 --> 27:55.686
What's that Kevin?
I couldn't hear you.

27:55.688 --> 27:59.232
Um, I'm gonna save
a place called Northpole,

27:59.234 --> 28:03.115
make sure Santa can still
bring presents and stuff.

28:04.873 --> 28:08.281
Hey, hey, hey! It is
an unconventional idea,

28:08.283 --> 28:10.206
but as Einstein said,

28:10.208 --> 28:12.976
imagination is even more
important than knowledge.

28:12.978 --> 28:16.790
All right, look, Kevin,
we'll talk after class.

28:16.793 --> 28:18.378
Now, moving on...

28:22.534 --> 28:24.760
Thank you.

28:24.762 --> 28:27.090
Please come in.
Sit down.

28:27.092 --> 28:31.886
Oh, and which happy constituent
do I have to thank for this?

28:31.888 --> 28:33.776
Chelsea Hastings
with <i> The Examiner.</i>

28:33.778 --> 28:36.376
You haven't returned
my phone calls!

28:38.878 --> 28:40.733
You're very tricky,
Miss Hastings.

28:40.735 --> 28:42.016
I applaud your tenacity.

28:42.018 --> 28:43.468
Well, it seemed better

28:43.470 --> 28:45.528
than interrupting
your speech at the Kiwanis.

28:45.530 --> 28:46.980
Tell me, how do you feel

28:46.982 --> 28:49.411
about cancelling
a century-old tradition?

28:49.413 --> 28:52.923
Ah, this is about
the tree lighting.

28:52.925 --> 28:56.704
Look, I was elected on
an austerity platform.

28:56.706 --> 28:59.711
Now, I'm not gonna
spend money on some ceremony

28:59.713 --> 29:02.548
that, well, hardly
anybody goes to anymore.

29:02.550 --> 29:04.101
I'm sure it's not that bad.

29:04.103 --> 29:05.958
Have you been there?
No, not yet.

29:05.960 --> 29:07.206
It's an eyesore.

29:07.208 --> 29:09.301
The warming chalet
is all boarded up.

29:09.303 --> 29:11.427
The skating rink
needs maintenance.

29:11.429 --> 29:13.858
I'm sure you can
understand my position.

29:13.860 --> 29:16.831
What I can't understand
is why the planning commission,

29:16.833 --> 29:19.397
who usually overseas
construction projects,

29:19.399 --> 29:21.795
is suddenly involved with
a Christmas-tree lighting.

29:21.797 --> 29:23.584
And who told you that?

29:23.586 --> 29:26.219
Sorry, I can't
reveal my source.

29:26.221 --> 29:27.772
I can't comment any further.

29:27.774 --> 29:31.385
I see. Well, at least
I'm starting to.

29:34.728 --> 29:36.890
OK, let me make sure
I got this right.

29:36.892 --> 29:41.279
Sparks of happiness rise
and form the Northern Lights...

29:41.281 --> 29:42.258
Right.

29:42.260 --> 29:43.913
Which then float down

29:43.915 --> 29:45.804
in the middle of
magic snowflakes

29:45.806 --> 29:48.708
that elves use to make toys,
which make kids happy,

29:48.710 --> 29:51.341
and the whole cycle
just repeats itself?

29:51.343 --> 29:52.345
Exactly!

29:55.564 --> 29:57.859
Means more Christmas
happiness overall!

29:57.861 --> 29:59.851
And maybe that can snowball.

29:59.853 --> 30:01.911
Wow, you've really
thought this through.

30:01.913 --> 30:03.666
So you'll let me do it?

30:03.668 --> 30:05.322
Of course I will, OK?

30:05.324 --> 30:08.868
But supposing that your
hypothesis here is correct,

30:08.870 --> 30:11.840
what are some of
the things you can do

30:11.842 --> 30:13.865
to help spread
holiday happiness here?

30:13.867 --> 30:15.553
That's where
I'm kind of stuck.

30:15.555 --> 30:18.086
Well, what are some
of the things

30:18.088 --> 30:20.652
that make you happy
at Christmas?

30:20.654 --> 30:22.374
Well, in my old town,

30:22.376 --> 30:25.380
Christmas is all about
carolling and baking cookies,

30:25.382 --> 30:29.331
and the best thing of all was
the big Christmas-tree lighting.

30:29.333 --> 30:32.439
It was so cool how the
whole town got together.

30:32.441 --> 30:33.957
But my mom said, here,

30:33.959 --> 30:36.861
they're not even gonna
have a tree lighting.

30:36.863 --> 30:38.583
I mean, really?

30:38.585 --> 30:40.879
I know, it's funny.
It used to be huge.

30:40.881 --> 30:44.595
I guess, over the years, people
just sort of forgot about it.

30:44.597 --> 30:47.025
Maybe they need
to be reminded.

30:48.445 --> 30:50.605
That's what we gotta do!

30:50.607 --> 30:52.867
We gotta save the tree lighting!

30:52.869 --> 30:54.083
Save the...

30:55.369 --> 30:58.135
OK, that's a, uh,
that is a tall order, Kev,

30:58.137 --> 31:00.667
but I did ask you
to dream big, didn't I?

31:00.669 --> 31:03.335
All right,
let's break this down.

31:03.337 --> 31:05.429
Hi, is this the
public works department?

31:05.431 --> 31:07.184
<i> Yes.</i>

31:07.186 --> 31:09.110
- I wanted to see if...
<i>- Can you hold, pleas. Can you hold, please?</i>

31:09.113 --> 31:10.629
Yes, of course, I'll hold.

31:10.631 --> 31:12.385
Oh!

31:23.698 --> 31:26.433
<i>Please continue to hold.</i>

31:43.554 --> 31:45.782
Used to be one great park!

31:45.784 --> 31:48.078
When the ice was groomed

31:48.080 --> 31:49.834
and that tree was lit up,

31:49.836 --> 31:51.658
it was magical!

31:51.660 --> 31:55.169
What you're holding in your hand
means the end of all that.

31:55.171 --> 31:57.264
I don't think I'm following.

31:57.266 --> 31:59.357
Those numbers are coordinates.

31:59.359 --> 32:03.882
A few days ago, a couple of
surveyors drove up here.

32:03.884 --> 32:07.359
"Peterson," I think, was written
on the side of their truck.

32:07.361 --> 32:09.960
"Peterson"?
Or did it say "Pendleton?"

32:09.962 --> 32:11.683
That's it, "Pendleton."

32:11.685 --> 32:15.835
Whoever he is has something
in mind for this place

32:15.837 --> 32:18.098
other than ice skating.

32:24.819 --> 32:26.540
So, how's the
investigation going?

32:26.542 --> 32:29.681
Well, it's an enigma
wrapped in a riddle

32:29.683 --> 32:31.504
inside 3 layers of mystery.

32:31.506 --> 32:33.024
Or is that a turducken?

32:34.512 --> 32:36.164
Did you talk to the mayor yet?

32:36.166 --> 32:38.291
Yeah, I can see
why people like him.

32:38.293 --> 32:41.161
I still don't think
he's being straight with me.

32:41.163 --> 32:43.255
You always see
the half-empty glass.

32:43.257 --> 32:46.463
Honey, somebody has to,
or we'd run out of milk.

32:49.166 --> 32:50.482
Who's Ernie Pendleton?

32:50.484 --> 32:53.386
Hmm! That's what
I'd like to know.

32:54.772 --> 32:56.255
Oh! That's Mrs. Tucker.

32:56.257 --> 32:59.396
Now, listen, make sure
you do your homework, OK?

32:59.398 --> 33:01.726
I love you.

33:05.644 --> 33:06.858
Hi, Mrs. Tucker!

33:06.860 --> 33:08.548
Hello!
How are you?

33:08.550 --> 33:10.607
Good!
Thanks for coming over.

33:10.609 --> 33:12.532
It's always a pleasure.

33:12.534 --> 33:14.255
He's a good boy!
No trouble at all!

33:14.257 --> 33:15.672
I'll be back before dinner.

33:15.674 --> 33:18.036
OK!

33:18.038 --> 33:19.692
Hello, Kevin!

33:19.694 --> 33:20.940
Hey, Mrs. Tucker!

33:20.942 --> 33:22.425
Doing your schoolwork?

33:22.427 --> 33:23.775
Mm-hmm!

33:23.777 --> 33:26.814
All right, dear!
I'll be watching my soaps!

33:26.816 --> 33:28.400
Let me know
if you need any help!

33:45.181 --> 33:48.489
So, how did you know
I'd be at home?

33:48.491 --> 33:50.785
Magic snowflake, back pack.

33:50.787 --> 33:53.316
Hello!

33:53.318 --> 33:56.592
Oh, yeah, right.

33:58.450 --> 34:00.845
If we're gonna do
something, we gotta hurry.

34:00.847 --> 34:03.782
My babysitter's soap is
over in exactly one hour.

34:03.784 --> 34:07.057
OK, so what do
you have in mind?

34:07.059 --> 34:09.116
I was thinking
about what Santa said,

34:09.118 --> 34:12.018
with, you know, snowflakes
turning into snowballs.

34:12.021 --> 34:14.112
And?

34:14.114 --> 34:16.746
And what if we get
a lot of people together

34:16.748 --> 34:18.907
to do something
really Christmassy.

34:18.909 --> 34:20.527
Like?

34:20.530 --> 34:23.802
Like saving the town's
tree-lighting ceremony!

34:23.804 --> 34:26.063
That could create a ton
of happiness sparks.

34:26.065 --> 34:28.326
So, what do you think?

34:28.328 --> 34:30.047
I think it's pure genius!

34:30.049 --> 34:31.871
Let's go!

34:31.873 --> 34:35.349
Whoa, there! Not dressed
like that, you can't.

34:35.351 --> 34:38.388
Throw on my old coat
and switch hats.

34:38.389 --> 34:40.378
Be sure to pull it
over your ears.

34:40.380 --> 34:42.405
What... what's wrong
with my ears?

34:42.407 --> 34:46.051
Nothing, except
mine are round,

34:46.053 --> 34:48.009
and yours aren't,

34:48.011 --> 34:51.248
if you get my, uh, "point".

34:51.251 --> 34:55.469
OK, but these clothes, they
don't reflect my personal flair.

34:55.471 --> 34:58.508
My town, my rules.

35:01.042 --> 35:03.336
OK!

35:03.338 --> 35:06.273
Slow down! You're
gonna melt those keys.

35:06.275 --> 35:09.311
How come everybody at
City Hall runs for the hills

35:09.313 --> 35:10.628
when I ask them

35:10.630 --> 35:12.857
about the canceled
tree-lighting ceremony

35:12.859 --> 35:14.713
and that survey flag
at Greenwood Park?

35:14.715 --> 35:16.976
Good questions!
Here's another:

35:16.978 --> 35:19.913
Jake in ad sales is a great guy,
and I was wondering if...

35:19.915 --> 35:23.727
You mean the guy who talks
too much about monster trucks?

35:23.729 --> 35:25.449
Yeah, no, I don't think so.

35:25.451 --> 35:27.205
Thanks, though!

35:27.207 --> 35:28.521
All right!
I tried!

35:28.523 --> 35:29.805
Hmm!

35:31.324 --> 35:33.618
Help us save the
Christmas-tree lighting!

35:33.620 --> 35:34.902
Make a donation here!

35:34.904 --> 35:36.725
Help save the
tree-lighting ceremony!

35:36.727 --> 35:38.412
Help save the tree lighting!

35:38.414 --> 35:39.832
Hey, you two!

35:39.834 --> 35:42.668
You're driving off my
business with this racket.

35:42.670 --> 35:44.490
There's no panhandling
here! Now, shoo!

35:44.492 --> 35:46.043
We weren't panhandling.

35:46.045 --> 35:48.879
I'm pretty sure we would know
if we were handling pans!

35:48.881 --> 35:50.703
Move along before
I call the cops.

35:50.705 --> 35:52.728
I think he needs
a dose of happiness.

35:52.730 --> 35:53.875
No!

35:55.599 --> 35:58.669
They don't have
magic snow here, remember?

35:58.671 --> 35:59.918
Run!
Uh-oh!

35:59.920 --> 36:05.862
Sorry! Merry Christmas!

36:05.864 --> 36:08.899
I can't believe
you snuck out on Mrs. Tucker!

36:08.901 --> 36:11.194
You almost gave her
a heart attack!

36:11.196 --> 36:13.254
What has gotten into you lately?

36:13.256 --> 36:14.942
Uh, Christmas?

36:14.944 --> 36:17.980
OK, we need to move beyond
the obsession with Christmas.

36:17.982 --> 36:19.534
Broaden your horizons.

36:19.536 --> 36:22.708
I don't have time to have
my horizons broadened.

36:22.710 --> 36:26.118
Kevin, you're 10 years of age.
You have nothing but time!

36:26.120 --> 36:27.906
I don't know
if you've noticed,

36:27.908 --> 36:29.965
but I've only got a few days

36:29.967 --> 36:32.734
to work on my class project to
save the town's tree lighting.

36:32.736 --> 36:34.219
That's your class project?

36:34.222 --> 36:37.156
I don't mean to sound like
my usual negative self,

36:37.158 --> 36:40.262
but I think that's gonna be
a tough one to pull off.

36:40.264 --> 36:42.154
Mr. Wilson says
I'll learn more

36:42.156 --> 36:44.786
by doing something
difficult and failing

36:44.788 --> 36:47.015
than doing something
easy and succeeding.

36:47.017 --> 36:49.277
That's what
Mr. Wilson says, huh?

36:49.279 --> 36:50.694
Yep!

36:50.696 --> 36:52.957
Well, I guess
that's pretty good advice.

36:52.959 --> 36:56.198
Listen, no more skipping out
on Mrs. Tucker. I mean it.

36:56.200 --> 36:58.662
OK.

36:58.664 --> 37:02.545
Wait! We still have to get
our own Christmas tree.

37:02.547 --> 37:05.752
You're right! How about
you and I go get one?

37:05.754 --> 37:07.608
And not just any tree.

37:07.610 --> 37:10.782
The absolute best, most amazing
Christmas tree we can find.

37:10.784 --> 37:12.470
You got it!

37:15.072 --> 37:17.771
Is that a Christmas tree
or a giant sequoia?

37:17.773 --> 37:19.898
But I like this one!

37:19.900 --> 37:23.071
Can I do a bait-and-switch and
offer mini-golfing instead?

37:23.073 --> 37:24.725
Sorry, too late.

37:24.727 --> 37:25.806
Hmm!

37:25.808 --> 37:27.055
Hey!

37:27.057 --> 37:29.789
That's quite a
conifer you got there!

37:29.791 --> 37:32.592
Kind of makes this one
look a little...

37:32.594 --> 37:35.091
Puny?

37:35.093 --> 37:37.318
But accurate.

37:37.320 --> 37:38.465
Guess I'll keep looking!

37:38.467 --> 37:40.458
I think we should
keep looking too.

37:40.460 --> 37:41.673
All right!

37:41.675 --> 37:44.071
Hard to beat perfect,
but I'll try.

37:44.073 --> 37:45.759
Bye, Mr. Wilson!

37:45.761 --> 37:47.210
See ya!

37:48.494 --> 37:50.249
Funny to see you here.

37:50.251 --> 37:55.921
50/50 chance. Only 2 tree
lots in the whole town.

37:55.923 --> 37:59.600
♪<i> There's a place not too</i>
<i>far</i> ♪

37:59.602 --> 38:01.154
♪<i> With tree and a star</i> ♪

38:01.156 --> 38:02.943
♪<i> There might be mistletoe</i> ♪

38:02.945 --> 38:05.171
♪<i> You won't know</i>
<i>unless you go...</i> ♪

38:05.173 --> 38:07.230
Oh, that's a beauty!

38:07.232 --> 38:08.951
Clementine?

38:08.953 --> 38:12.598
In Northpole, we light up
a tree every day of the year.

38:12.600 --> 38:15.299
What are you doing here,
and where's your hat?

38:17.292 --> 38:19.079
Oh! Gosh, I am
such a snowflake!

38:19.082 --> 38:22.794
Hurry and get back to
my house before anyone sees you!

38:22.796 --> 38:24.954
OK!
Go!

38:24.956 --> 38:27.858
Kevin told me
about the Christmas project.

38:27.860 --> 38:30.288
Yeah, I asked them
to think big,

38:30.290 --> 38:31.571
and boy, did he ever!

38:31.573 --> 38:33.834
Fostering imagination is fine,

38:33.836 --> 38:37.007
but your assignment is enabling
his whole Northpole fantasy.

38:37.009 --> 38:39.201
Just because you
can't see something

38:39.203 --> 38:40.923
doesn't mean it doesn't exist.

38:40.925 --> 38:42.746
Like elves, right?
No, but...

38:42.748 --> 38:44.198
Look, it's fine being the one

38:44.200 --> 38:45.920
filling his head
with sugarplums,

38:45.922 --> 38:48.823
but I'll be dealing with
the sugar crash when it comes,

38:48.825 --> 38:52.470
and believe me, it will!

38:52.472 --> 38:56.723
You ever notice how Christmas
trees are kind of like people?

38:56.725 --> 38:58.850
What do you mean?

38:58.852 --> 39:00.976
Well, some trees
are too sappy.

39:00.978 --> 39:02.699
That's for sure.

39:02.701 --> 39:05.805
The other trees,
they're just, like,

39:05.807 --> 39:08.000
well, they're just
way too prickly.

39:08.002 --> 39:09.349
You can't get near 'em.

39:09.351 --> 39:11.511
Hmm! Yeah, I get it.

39:11.513 --> 39:13.874
Look, Kevin is just
looking at things

39:13.876 --> 39:15.899
a little differently, you know?

39:15.901 --> 39:19.241
Something I think everyone
should do once in a while.

39:23.260 --> 39:24.509
You OK?

39:24.511 --> 39:25.690
Yeah, I thought I...

39:27.243 --> 39:29.404
Nothing.

39:34.875 --> 39:36.695
Ah!

39:36.697 --> 39:39.971
Perfect! Now, if someone would
just call me an ambulance...

39:39.973 --> 39:42.233
I thought you were
a mountain man, huh?

39:42.235 --> 39:44.055
Only in my mind, not my back.

39:44.057 --> 39:46.588
Thank you. We never would've
gotten this monster in here

39:46.590 --> 39:48.512
if you didn't offer to help.

39:48.514 --> 39:49.896
My pleasure!

39:49.898 --> 39:52.023
Maybe some hot chocolate

39:52.025 --> 39:53.778
will make your back feel better?

39:53.780 --> 39:54.758
Terrific!

39:54.760 --> 39:57.052
Two marshmallows
in mine, please!

39:57.054 --> 39:58.673
I know, I know!

40:08.028 --> 40:11.874
<i>I don't know what to say,</i>
<i>honey.</i>

40:11.876 --> 40:13.663
I know, Mom.
I worry too.

40:13.665 --> 40:15.453
So things are getting worse?

40:15.455 --> 40:17.985
I'm afraid so.

40:17.987 --> 40:20.145
Assembly lines have slowed,

40:20.147 --> 40:22.542
and elves are starting to talk

40:22.544 --> 40:27.133
about not being able to supply
enough toys for Christmas.

40:27.135 --> 40:30.037
Don't let your candy cane
lose its stripes, Mom.

40:30.039 --> 40:32.063
We're working on it.

40:32.065 --> 40:35.776
I know you are, honey,
but don't get your hopes up.

40:35.778 --> 40:38.172
It looks like this problem
may be even bigger

40:38.174 --> 40:39.523
than your determination.

40:43.575 --> 40:48.232
Tomorrow, we kick
things up a notch.

40:48.234 --> 40:50.729
Kevin's talking
to his imaginary elf.

40:50.732 --> 40:53.566
I wish he would
just make one real friend.

40:53.568 --> 40:56.673
Well, I was 12 when our
family moved us to Colorado.

40:56.675 --> 40:59.711
I became a little withdrawn,
but, hey, look at me now!

41:02.346 --> 41:04.403
Wow, nice Christmas display!

41:04.405 --> 41:06.259
All you need now
is a nativity scene

41:06.261 --> 41:07.779
made out of office supplies.

41:07.781 --> 41:10.074
Yeah, I tend to
bring my work home.

41:11.627 --> 41:14.497
Oh, that isn't
Greenwood Park, is it?

41:14.499 --> 41:17.704
Yeah! Did you know it used to
be called Christmas Tree Park?

41:17.706 --> 41:20.844
It's been having tree lightings
for almost a century.

41:20.846 --> 41:23.004
Hmm, it was so
cared for back then.

41:23.006 --> 41:24.456
Look at these two!

41:29.825 --> 41:32.252
Go ahead and take it.
I gotta get going.

41:32.254 --> 41:33.874
OK. Thanks, though,

41:33.876 --> 41:35.832
for helping us with
the Christmas tree.

41:40.627 --> 41:41.801
Hello?

41:41.803 --> 41:43.886
-<i> This is Watson Elementary.</i>

41:43.888 --> 41:46.979
We're having an after-school
assembly tomorrow,

41:46.981 --> 41:50.005
so pickup will be
at 5:00 p.m.

41:50.007 --> 41:52.122
Merry Christmas! Beep!

41:54.005 --> 41:56.290
You're not supposed
to say the beep.

41:56.292 --> 41:59.282
Oh, sorry! I was
just so in the moment.

42:00.896 --> 42:02.441
Mr. Pendleton?

42:02.443 --> 42:03.752
Yes?

42:03.754 --> 42:06.004
Chelsea Hastings
with <i> The Examiner.</i> Hi!

42:06.006 --> 42:08.659
I have a publicist that
deals with press inquiries.

42:08.661 --> 42:10.711
If you'd like to
make an appointment...

42:10.713 --> 42:13.063
I just wanted to ask
you a couple questions

42:13.065 --> 42:15.148
about your plans
for Greenwood Park.

42:15.150 --> 42:18.206
Look, I understand that you had
a crew surveying the property.

42:18.208 --> 42:21.165
Do you and the mayor have
plans that I don't know about?

42:21.167 --> 42:23.383
Please, just take
my word for it:

42:23.385 --> 42:26.409
After the holidays,
it'll all sort itself out.

42:26.411 --> 42:28.727
I would be a lousy reporter

42:28.729 --> 42:31.484
if I took everybody's
word at face value.

42:31.486 --> 42:34.644
I'm sorry, I really
can't comment any further.

42:38.410 --> 42:39.417
Mr. Jenkins!

42:39.419 --> 42:40.965
<i>Drop whatever you're doing.</i>

42:40.967 --> 42:43.115
There's a protest going
on at Greenwood Park.

42:43.117 --> 42:44.325
I need you there.

42:44.327 --> 42:45.973
Greenwood Park?

42:45.975 --> 42:48.695
Why are we still
talking, Hastings?

42:48.697 --> 42:51.048
I'm on it, sir.

42:51.050 --> 42:53.838
We need you all to
stand back. Just stand back.

42:53.840 --> 42:55.686
Excuse me.
Oh, sorry!

42:55.688 --> 42:57.469
<i>10-4.</i>

42:57.471 --> 42:59.922
Copy desk?
Hey, this is Chelsea.

42:59.924 --> 43:03.317
I'm here at the protest.
Can I dictate a story?

43:03.319 --> 43:06.342
Jenkins will want this
on the website ASAP.

43:06.344 --> 43:08.359
Yeah.

43:09.841 --> 43:11.419
A lone protester
in Greenwood Park

43:11.421 --> 43:14.175
caused emergency vehicles
to come out this afternoon.

43:14.177 --> 43:16.359
He's really wedged
in up there, Captain.

43:16.361 --> 43:17.704
Bucket's going up now.

43:17.706 --> 43:19.285
Fire officials have gathered

43:19.287 --> 43:22.847
to try to coax down
the reluctant figure

43:22.849 --> 43:24.931
suspended 50 feet
above the ice rink.

43:24.933 --> 43:27.386
As far as a statement
from the protester...

43:27.388 --> 43:28.965
Hey, Mom!

43:30.243 --> 43:31.923
Kevin?

43:31.925 --> 43:34.075
What are you doing up there?

43:34.077 --> 43:35.486
Stringing up decorations!

43:35.488 --> 43:38.142
Figured if nobody else
would do it, we would.

43:38.144 --> 43:39.990
Sir, that... that's
my son up there!

43:39.992 --> 43:42.579
So I gathered. Ma'am,
why don't you step aside?

43:42.581 --> 43:44.159
We'll handle this.

43:44.161 --> 43:47.016
As long as he's up there,
I'm staying right here.

43:47.018 --> 43:49.638
I see the ornament doesn't
fall far from the tree.

43:52.564 --> 43:54.244
You got him?

44:02.614 --> 44:05.740
I can almost see
our house from up there!

44:05.742 --> 44:09.235
Yeah? Did you also see me
lose 10 years off my life?

44:09.237 --> 44:10.916
Oh gosh! Oh!
Thank you!

44:10.918 --> 44:12.966
Honey, I thought
you were supposed to be

44:12.968 --> 44:14.950
at a school assembly
meeting friends!

44:14.952 --> 44:17.235
I was actually here
with a friend.

44:17.237 --> 44:21.975
Clementine? Clementine!

44:21.977 --> 44:25.203
Huh! She was just
here a second ago.

44:25.205 --> 44:27.119
Clementine? The elf?

44:27.121 --> 44:28.395
Exactly!

44:28.397 --> 44:30.581
We're going home right now.

44:33.808 --> 44:36.027
I heard what happened.
Is Kevin all right?

44:36.029 --> 44:38.378
If you consider grounded
for life all right.

44:38.380 --> 44:40.295
I knew this was gonna happen.

44:40.297 --> 44:42.615
<i>Firemen were
called to Greenwood Park,</i>

44:42.617 --> 44:44.967
<i>where a child was pulled
from a 60-foot tree...</i>

44:44.969 --> 44:47.959
Get your facts straight!
It was a 50-foot tree!

44:47.961 --> 44:50.515
<i>More strange activity
with the Northern Lights.</i>

44:50.517 --> 44:52.464
Well, at least he wasn't hurt.

44:52.466 --> 44:54.010
Yeah, but he could've been,

44:54.012 --> 44:56.631
all because of the ceremony
that nobody cares about

44:56.633 --> 44:58.952
and a park that's not
gonna exist in a month.

44:58.954 --> 45:01.775
What do you mean,
isn't gonna exist in a month?

45:01.777 --> 45:04.632
Mr. Pendleton, the developer,
he's building condos on it.

45:04.634 --> 45:06.985
What? How could that guy
be such a Scrooge?

45:06.987 --> 45:09.808
I don't know. If I knew,
maybe I could change his mind.

45:09.810 --> 45:12.027
But right now, what
I'm worried about is Kevin.

45:12.029 --> 45:14.851
This whole thing has
gotten out of hand!

45:14.853 --> 45:16.936
OK, OK!
Look, let's just take it easy.

45:16.938 --> 45:18.582
OK, this is what I'm gonna do:

45:18.584 --> 45:19.960
I'm gonna pack our bags,

45:19.962 --> 45:22.516
book us tickets to someplace
warm for the holidays,

45:22.518 --> 45:24.935
away from this town
and your little assignment

45:24.937 --> 45:27.322
that turned into
Kevin's mission!

45:27.324 --> 45:29.406
No! I can't leave now!

45:29.408 --> 45:31.020
It's too important!

45:31.022 --> 45:32.499
You gotta believe me!

45:32.501 --> 45:35.255
Honey, it's a fantasy.
It's not real!

45:35.257 --> 45:36.700
Yes, it is!

45:36.702 --> 45:39.255
You listen to me, Mister!
No, you're wrong!

45:39.257 --> 45:42.752
Just 'cause you don't think
it's real, doesn't mean it isn't!

45:42.754 --> 45:46.313
Kevin! Honey!

45:46.315 --> 45:47.828
Kevin!

45:47.830 --> 45:49.912
He's just a little
boy, Chelsea,

45:49.914 --> 45:52.230
who isn't quite ready
to grow up.

45:52.232 --> 45:56.332
Yeah, I know 2 people
who are stuck in that phase.

45:56.334 --> 45:59.659
Which is probably why
it's so hard for you to decide

45:59.662 --> 46:02.684
whether to let Kevin stay
in his own little world

46:02.686 --> 46:05.407
or drag him kicking and
screaming into yours.

46:05.409 --> 46:08.164
Good night, Mr. Wilson.

46:16.838 --> 46:20.399
This Pendleton guy wants to demolish the park!
Kevin!

46:20.401 --> 46:22.987
So there will never be
a tree lighting ever again!

46:22.989 --> 46:26.685
I know! I heard everything,
including what your mom said

46:26.687 --> 46:29.945
about wishing she knew why
Mr. Pendleton is such a Scrooge!

46:29.948 --> 46:31.324
Which gave me an idea.

46:31.326 --> 46:34.585
OK, grab your coat,
and let's go.

46:49.780 --> 46:51.190
Kevin?

46:52.537 --> 46:54.047
Kevin?

46:59.695 --> 47:01.611
Kevin?

47:03.293 --> 47:05.476
So, tell me why
we're here again?

47:05.478 --> 47:07.628
To find out why
Mr. Pendleton is so mean,

47:07.630 --> 47:09.847
he would cut down
the city's Christmas tree.

47:09.849 --> 47:11.628
I mean, who would
do such a thing?

47:11.630 --> 47:13.778
And maybe whatever we find,
your mom can use

47:13.780 --> 47:16.670
to help bring the tree-lighting
ceremony back on track.

47:16.672 --> 47:19.426
Sounds like kind
of a long shot.

47:20.974 --> 47:24.469
Right now, my friend,
it's the only shot we got.

47:27.765 --> 47:32.335
I checked State Street and
the park on my way back over.

47:32.337 --> 47:33.746
I shouldn't have
been so hard on him.

47:33.748 --> 47:36.602
I shouldn't have encouraged
him in the first place.

47:36.604 --> 47:39.192
I'm gonna call the police.

47:44.639 --> 47:46.485
What do you think
Santa will do

47:46.487 --> 47:49.142
if he catches us sneaking
into the archives?

47:49.144 --> 47:51.158
Don't know and
don't wanna find out,

47:51.160 --> 47:52.974
so pipe down!

47:56.268 --> 47:57.915
Right here.

47:57.917 --> 47:59.455
Hurry!

47:59.457 --> 48:02.736
If my mom checks out my room
and sees that I'm not there,

48:02.738 --> 48:05.346
she'll have bloodhounds
looking for me!

48:05.348 --> 48:09.163
We're getting
warmer and warmer

48:09.165 --> 48:10.904
and warmer and...

48:12.178 --> 48:13.784
Bingo!

48:13.786 --> 48:16.528
We've narrowed it down
to the past 50 years!

48:17.868 --> 48:19.174
Another power dip.

48:19.176 --> 48:21.383
Because we're running
out of magic snow.

48:21.384 --> 48:23.994
How many Ernie Q.
Pendletons can there be?

48:23.996 --> 48:25.901
Apparently a lot.

48:25.903 --> 48:28.076
What were those
mothers thinking?

48:28.078 --> 48:29.918
Oh!

48:31.025 --> 48:32.429
Got it!

48:32.431 --> 48:33.734
Wow!

48:33.736 --> 48:35.676
Age 7, 8 and 9,

48:35.678 --> 48:38.755
all he asked for
was a gift for a penny.

48:38.757 --> 48:41.201
Money must've gone a lot
further in those days!

48:41.203 --> 48:44.247
They weren't gifts
for a penny.

48:44.249 --> 48:46.791
They were gifts for
a person named Penny.

48:46.793 --> 48:49.234
"Dear Santa,
can you please bring

48:49.236 --> 48:51.545
"some white ice skates, size 4,

48:51.547 --> 48:53.152
"to my friend, Penny,

48:53.154 --> 48:55.026
"so we can skate together.

48:55.028 --> 48:57.169
"Her mom is sick,

48:57.171 --> 49:00.015
"and her dad says they don't
have any money for skates.

49:00.017 --> 49:01.622
"Thank you. Ernie."

49:01.624 --> 49:04.265
All he asked for
was gifts for her!

49:04.267 --> 49:06.140
But nothing for himself!

49:06.142 --> 49:10.794
Which means maybe
he's not all bad.

49:10.796 --> 49:12.568
We gotta show mom!

49:12.570 --> 49:13.907
Yeah!

49:13.909 --> 49:15.614
OK, help me!

49:17.389 --> 49:18.928
Come!

49:20.737 --> 49:22.980
I need to file a missing
person's report.

49:22.982 --> 49:24.150
Mom!

49:24.152 --> 49:25.154
Never mind.

49:25.156 --> 49:26.394
Kevin?

49:26.396 --> 49:28.167
Honey!

49:28.169 --> 49:31.215
I have been so
worried about you!

49:31.217 --> 49:32.654
Where have you been?

49:32.656 --> 49:35.800
Collecting information
for you about Mr. Pendleton.

49:35.802 --> 49:37.106
What? Information?

49:37.108 --> 49:39.850
Yeah, about why he's so mean,

49:39.852 --> 49:42.932
and it turns out maybe
you were wrong about him.

49:42.934 --> 49:44.806
Maybe he is a good guy.

49:44.808 --> 49:47.149
Look! When he was a kid,

49:47.151 --> 49:50.464
he never asked for
any presents for himself,

49:50.466 --> 49:53.845
only for somebody named Penny.

49:55.453 --> 49:57.460
Where did you get this?

49:57.462 --> 49:58.699
Uh...

49:58.701 --> 49:59.836
Kevin!

49:59.838 --> 50:01.576
Northpole.

50:01.578 --> 50:03.218
We found it in Santa's files.

50:03.220 --> 50:04.490
"We"?

50:04.492 --> 50:07.135
As in you and
Clementine, the elf?

50:09.714 --> 50:11.151
Honey, listen to me.

50:11.153 --> 50:13.195
You know you're the
most precious thing

50:13.197 --> 50:14.433
in the world to me, right?

50:14.435 --> 50:15.973
Of course.

50:15.975 --> 50:17.848
I didn't mean to scare you, Mom,

50:17.850 --> 50:21.496
but I thought it was important,
'cause it might help protect...

50:21.498 --> 50:23.404
Northpole.

50:23.406 --> 50:26.116
And Christmas?
Right.

50:26.118 --> 50:29.597
'Cause even though
you don't believe it,

50:29.599 --> 50:31.204
I know it's real.

50:38.873 --> 50:40.880
I, um...

50:40.882 --> 50:43.357
I believe that you believe.

50:44.864 --> 50:46.537
And that's good enough for me.

50:46.539 --> 50:49.651
Really?
Yeah.

50:49.653 --> 50:51.826
And if you say
spreading holiday cheer

50:51.828 --> 50:53.667
is the only way
to save Northpole,

50:53.669 --> 50:55.743
then we better find
a way to do it.

50:57.385 --> 51:00.229
Oh, that'll be Clementine!

51:01.568 --> 51:03.442
This should be interesting.

51:06.357 --> 51:09.368
Hey, Ms. Hastings!
I'm Clementine!

51:09.370 --> 51:11.142
She's the one I've been
telling you guys about.

51:11.144 --> 51:13.853
Right! You're the, um...

51:13.855 --> 51:16.131
Only member of Kevin's
Christmas Committee!

51:23.998 --> 51:27.880
Listen, um, thanks
for being here for me.

51:27.882 --> 51:31.228
I think maybe I was a little
over the top, and I'm sorry.

51:32.435 --> 51:34.709
Well, I might not
have any kids of my own,

51:34.711 --> 51:37.589
but from 8:00 to 3:00,
I have 30, so I can empathize.

51:37.591 --> 51:39.597
For what it's worth,

51:39.599 --> 51:42.510
I think it was a wise choice
to play along with the fantasy.

51:42.512 --> 51:44.183
At least for now.
Yeah.

51:44.185 --> 51:46.226
He's not gonna be
innocent for much longer,

51:46.228 --> 51:49.037
and I guess it's better to
embrace it than to cut it short.

51:49.039 --> 51:50.678
You helped me see that.

51:50.680 --> 51:51.950
Does that mean the mission

51:51.952 --> 51:53.422
to save Northpole's back on?

51:53.424 --> 51:55.097
Well, we've met Clementine!

51:55.099 --> 51:56.804
We can't let her
be homeless, right?

51:56.806 --> 51:58.411
We?

51:58.412 --> 52:00.185
You still want me
along for the ride?

52:00.187 --> 52:03.400
Well, are you willing?
Why would you think otherwise?

52:03.402 --> 52:05.072
Ask me when we have more time.

52:05.074 --> 52:07.852
Right now, we have a tree
lighting to save, right?

52:09.191 --> 52:11.065
All right, I'll see you.

52:11.067 --> 52:13.676
OK. Good night!
Good night!

52:15.953 --> 52:17.660
Mmm!

52:19.870 --> 52:21.745
OK, so, how's
this gonna work, Mom?

52:21.747 --> 52:23.552
Yeah, how's this gonna work?

52:23.554 --> 52:26.832
I suggest a 2-prong attack.
You guys spread the word.

52:26.834 --> 52:28.507
Sounds good to me!
Cool!

52:28.509 --> 52:30.682
We're gonna need food,
funds and a permit.

52:30.684 --> 52:31.887
We're on it!

52:31.889 --> 52:33.327
And I'll get something

52:33.329 --> 52:34.331
even more important.

52:34.333 --> 52:35.402
And what's that?

52:35.404 --> 52:41.495
Leverage.

52:41.497 --> 52:44.374
I got the list of the mayor's
biggest campaign donors.

52:44.377 --> 52:46.985
Guess who's at the top:
Mr. & Mrs. Ernie Pendleton.

52:46.987 --> 52:48.526
Uh-huh. Oh!

52:48.528 --> 52:51.438
Yeah, I gotta go. I'll see
you back at the office.

53:07.641 --> 53:10.319
Excuse me, sir,
I think you dropped this.

53:10.321 --> 53:12.160
No.

53:12.162 --> 53:13.767
Get some food, OK?

53:19.894 --> 53:22.739
Hey, Chelsea!
Ah...

53:22.741 --> 53:25.752
Don't worry! I'm not gonna try
and set you up with anyone.

53:25.754 --> 53:27.693
I just wanna see how
your story's going.

53:27.695 --> 53:30.071
Well, you know, a couple
things aren't adding up.

53:30.072 --> 53:32.547
I could clear up one thing
if the planning commission

53:32.549 --> 53:34.523
wasn't closed for Christmas.

53:34.525 --> 53:36.531
A woman I sing
with at church works

53:36.533 --> 53:38.071
for the planning commission.

53:38.073 --> 53:40.849
Seriously?
She'll be at practice tonight.

53:40.851 --> 53:42.357
Maybe she can help.

53:42.358 --> 53:44.063
You are a lifesaver!

53:44.065 --> 53:47.076
I just hope you
can carry a tune.

53:47.078 --> 53:48.482
Yeah!

53:50.995 --> 53:53.370
Donate to the town
tree lighting!

53:54.810 --> 53:56.718
Save a Christmas tradition!

53:56.720 --> 53:59.295
Here's a buck for
some trumpet lessons.

54:01.205 --> 54:03.380
Normally, I would
be offended by that,

54:03.382 --> 54:05.722
but it's for a good
cause, so thank you, sir!

54:05.724 --> 54:07.129
Merry Christmas!

54:07.131 --> 54:08.534
How's our website doing?

54:08.536 --> 54:09.806
Any better than we are?

54:09.808 --> 54:11.380
Well, we've only got 5 hits,

54:11.382 --> 54:13.322
and four of them are me!

54:13.324 --> 54:15.631
Which means
we've already had one hit!

54:15.633 --> 54:17.172
Yeah!

54:17.174 --> 54:18.979
Hey, guys!

54:18.981 --> 54:22.595
Hey, Mom! How's your side
of the attack going?

54:22.597 --> 54:24.804
It's coming along.
How about you guys?

54:24.806 --> 54:26.278
So far, we've raised $4,

54:26.280 --> 54:28.554
including 2 Canadian
quarters and a bus token!

54:28.556 --> 54:31.734
So, that puts us at about
98% short of our goal. Hmm!

54:31.736 --> 54:34.513
Or 2% closer to victory!

54:34.515 --> 54:37.659
I think we need to find a
better way to get the word out.

54:37.661 --> 54:39.835
You know, I think
I just might have one.

54:41.879 --> 54:43.551
Seriously?

54:43.553 --> 54:46.363
We're supposed to change minds
with tree scraps?

54:46.365 --> 54:50.246
Well, you call them scraps.
I call them festive pine art.

54:50.248 --> 54:52.591
Well,
either way, it'll be fun,

54:52.593 --> 54:54.131
which, as they say back home,

54:54.133 --> 54:56.039
is the best reason
to do anything.

55:01.094 --> 55:02.834
Hi there!
I'm Ryan Wilson.

55:02.836 --> 55:04.942
This is Chelsea Hastings.
Hi!

55:04.944 --> 55:06.416
Any chance you remember

55:06.418 --> 55:08.056
the tree lighting
in Greenwood Park?

55:08.058 --> 55:10.400
Oh, I do!

55:10.402 --> 55:12.677
Haven't thought
about it in years.

55:12.679 --> 55:15.756
But it was beautiful,
and so much fun!

55:15.758 --> 55:19.103
Well, it can be again,
with your help.

55:20.041 --> 55:21.447
Hope to see you there!

55:25.398 --> 55:27.874
Can any woman
resist your charm?

55:27.876 --> 55:30.988
I'm hoping one woman can't.

55:33.299 --> 55:36.745
So, how'd you get
into teaching, huh?

55:36.747 --> 55:40.562
Uh, well, after college,
I did a lot of jobs,

55:40.564 --> 55:42.838
but teaching is the best by far.

55:42.840 --> 55:44.484
Really? Why?

55:44.486 --> 55:46.733
Light bulbs.
Light bulbs?

55:46.735 --> 55:48.747
Yeah, turning on
over kids' heads

55:48.749 --> 55:50.863
when a concept they've
been struggling with

55:50.865 --> 55:52.070
finally sinks in.

55:52.072 --> 55:53.212
Hmm...
I love that.

55:53.214 --> 55:55.529
Oh, hey!
Hi there!

55:55.531 --> 55:57.979
Hope to see you there.
Thanks!

55:57.981 --> 56:01.371
Merry Christmas!
You too!

56:02.614 --> 56:05.567
Must be a challenge,
being a single mom.

56:05.569 --> 56:07.883
It was definitely
hard the first year

56:07.885 --> 56:09.326
after Kevin's father left.

56:09.328 --> 56:11.007
But I never had any illusions

56:11.009 --> 56:13.725
that the world would
make it easy for me, so...

56:13.727 --> 56:16.210
Is that why you're
such a skeptic?

56:17.522 --> 56:19.902
Well, partially by
nature, partially my job,

56:19.904 --> 56:22.924
and partially the result of
living with Kevin's father.

56:22.926 --> 56:25.509
Hmm... Feel like
telling me about him?

56:25.511 --> 56:26.886
Oh, hey!
Hi!

56:26.888 --> 56:29.437
Here you go!
Hope to see you there!

56:29.439 --> 56:30.983
Thanks!

56:31.822 --> 56:34.373
Yeah, sure! Um...

56:34.375 --> 56:37.663
We met in college,
both English majors.

56:37.665 --> 56:40.617
I wanted to be a journalist,
he wanted to be a novelist.

56:40.619 --> 56:43.269
Only difference is
I worked towards my goal,

56:43.271 --> 56:44.679
and he only dreamed of his.

56:44.681 --> 56:46.325
Where is he now?

56:46.327 --> 56:47.534
Oh! I don't know.

56:47.536 --> 56:49.480
Probably some place
with coconuts,

56:49.482 --> 56:51.294
dreaming of his first draft.

56:51.296 --> 56:54.281
Oh, look! Here's more
people.

56:54.283 --> 56:56.026
Special delivery!

56:56.028 --> 56:57.940
Tree lighting on Christmas Eve!

56:57.942 --> 57:00.190
Ah! That fella
could pull a sleigh!

57:00.192 --> 57:02.641
Hope to see you
at the tree lighting.

57:03.482 --> 57:05.192
Whoo!

57:05.194 --> 57:07.779
Once you make
learning fun, my job's easy.

57:07.781 --> 57:09.288
Fun? Yeah...

57:09.290 --> 57:11.101
Come to the tree lighting.
Thanks!

57:11.103 --> 57:13.653
I used to have some of that
before the responsibility

57:13.655 --> 57:15.969
of a pesky thing
called paying the bills.

57:15.971 --> 57:19.864
You know, I used to
pack a mean snowball.

57:19.866 --> 57:21.542
Oh, really?

57:21.544 --> 57:23.155
I bet you talk a big game.

57:23.157 --> 57:25.907
So, you don't think
I'd do this, huh?

57:28.192 --> 57:30.540
Oh, really?
It's on!

57:30.542 --> 57:32.319
No!

57:32.321 --> 57:35.039
Snowball fight!

57:38.063 --> 57:39.840
Oh, what do you want?

57:39.842 --> 57:43.096
You guys want
a piece of this? Oh!

58:08.343 --> 58:11.464
♪ Gloria

58:18.852 --> 58:23.820
<i>♪ In excelsis deo</i>

58:29.260 --> 58:31.608
Nice job!
Nice job, everybody!

58:31.610 --> 58:33.187
Let's take five!

58:36.848 --> 58:38.155
Hi!
Hi!

58:38.157 --> 58:40.102
Josephine, this is
my friend Chelsea,

58:40.104 --> 58:41.647
the one I told you about.

58:41.649 --> 58:44.132
Thank you so much
for talking with me.

58:44.134 --> 58:46.616
Well, to be honest, I'm not
really sure if I should.

58:46.618 --> 58:49.234
Look, all I need to know
is January's agenda.

58:49.236 --> 58:52.928
If it wasn't the holidays,
it'd be public, right?

58:52.930 --> 58:55.378
Right.
I guess it's OK.

58:55.380 --> 58:57.225
There are 2 items:

58:57.227 --> 59:00.280
a proposal to widen
a crosswalk on State Street,

59:00.282 --> 59:03.705
and an offer from a company
called Pendleton Development

59:03.707 --> 59:05.450
to purchase Greenwood Park.

59:05.452 --> 59:07.398
That's all I needed to know.

59:07.400 --> 59:09.546
Merry Christmas!
You too!

59:11.158 --> 59:13.475
Yes!

59:16.026 --> 59:18.443
Hastings!
When do I get the park story?

59:18.445 --> 59:21.497
I'm just putting the final
touches on it right now.

59:21.499 --> 59:24.720
Good! I wanna go big with this
in tomorrow's edition,

59:24.722 --> 59:26.601
and we go to press in 2 hours.

59:26.603 --> 59:29.321
Chelsea!
Yes, I understand.

59:29.323 --> 59:31.335
OK.

59:49.197 --> 59:50.841
OK...

01:00:00.411 --> 01:00:02.759
OK, what's next?

01:00:02.761 --> 01:00:05.646
OK, so now we need
2 mittenfuls of sugar.

01:00:05.648 --> 01:00:07.762
All right.

01:00:07.764 --> 01:00:08.803
One... Nice!

01:00:09.945 --> 01:00:11.153
One...

01:00:11.155 --> 01:00:12.965
Two!
And two!

01:00:12.967 --> 01:00:14.510
Perfect!

01:00:14.512 --> 01:00:18.135
OK, and now, one
bellful of sprinkles.

01:00:18.137 --> 01:00:20.587
A whole bellful?
And no skimping!

01:00:20.589 --> 01:00:23.239
There's no such thing
as too many sprinkles.

01:00:23.241 --> 01:00:24.716
Hey, guys!

01:00:24.718 --> 01:00:27.033
Sorry I'm late! Hi!
Guess what, Mom!

01:00:27.035 --> 01:00:29.584
We just got an anonymous
donation from the website!

01:00:29.586 --> 01:00:31.766
Ah!
A ginormous one!

01:00:31.768 --> 01:00:35.963
Yeah! Ginormous enough to
afford a generator and lights.

01:00:35.965 --> 01:00:38.782
We might actually be able
to pull this off, hmm?

01:00:38.784 --> 01:00:43.550
To our secret, but very
generous, benefactor.

01:00:43.552 --> 01:00:45.599
Thank you!
All right, cheers!

01:00:45.601 --> 01:00:47.277
Cheers!
Jingles!

01:00:47.279 --> 01:00:49.559
Jingles!

01:00:56.074 --> 01:00:58.456
Excuse me...

01:00:58.458 --> 01:01:01.042
Be careful, it's hot.
First batch out of the oven!

01:01:01.044 --> 01:01:03.358
Thank you!

01:01:04.735 --> 01:01:07.220
Wow! That is amazing!

01:01:07.222 --> 01:01:10.005
For every cup of
flour, 2 cups of happy.

01:01:10.007 --> 01:01:11.348
Got the recipe
from Grandma Lolli,

01:01:11.350 --> 01:01:13.094
who created it
with Grandma Dolli,

01:01:13.096 --> 01:01:14.638
with help from Grandma Lacybell.

01:01:14.640 --> 01:01:16.049
You have a lot of grandmas.

01:01:16.051 --> 01:01:17.661
Tell me about it!

01:01:17.663 --> 01:01:20.380
Last year, I got 204 pairs
of socks for Christmas.

01:01:22.832 --> 01:01:25.582
Can I ask you something?
Sure.

01:01:25.584 --> 01:01:29.008
You and Kev, you're
just pretending, right?

01:01:29.010 --> 01:01:32.633
I mean, you don't really think
you're from Northpole?

01:01:35.691 --> 01:01:39.583
You know, sometimes, it's
harder for people to believe

01:01:39.585 --> 01:01:43.209
in things they've never seen
than it is for others.

01:01:44.117 --> 01:01:45.794
Yeah...

01:01:45.796 --> 01:01:48.413
That basically describes me.

01:01:49.354 --> 01:01:51.266
But, Ms. Hastings,

01:01:51.268 --> 01:01:55.328
for Kevin, you ignored what
your head was telling you

01:01:55.330 --> 01:01:58.485
and chose to listen
to your heart instead.

01:01:58.487 --> 01:02:00.096
And just so you know,

01:02:00.098 --> 01:02:02.110
that meant so much to him.

01:02:03.119 --> 01:02:05.501
And what you're
trying to do here,

01:02:05.503 --> 01:02:07.415
to bring the town together,

01:02:07.417 --> 01:02:10.471
to light the tree
and make people happy...

01:02:10.473 --> 01:02:13.862
Well, that means
so much to me too.

01:02:16.312 --> 01:02:18.964
Clementine?
Yeah?

01:02:18.966 --> 01:02:22.321
How old are you?
13... decades!

01:02:23.699 --> 01:02:25.074
I'm kidding!

01:02:26.654 --> 01:02:29.439
I'll get you another cookie.

01:02:34.544 --> 01:02:36.019
Hey!

01:02:36.021 --> 01:02:38.906
Oh, it looks like you've
been working all night!

01:02:38.908 --> 01:02:42.465
Well, I promise posters,
I deliver posters.

01:02:42.467 --> 01:02:45.655
A man who finishes
what he starts.

01:02:45.657 --> 01:02:47.770
I'm not used to that.

01:02:47.772 --> 01:02:49.818
Maybe it's time
for that to change.

01:02:51.463 --> 01:02:54.719
I need some more
coffee. You want some?

01:02:54.721 --> 01:02:56.835
Sure!

01:02:58.951 --> 01:03:02.575
OK, so I have
the food all set,

01:03:02.577 --> 01:03:04.723
um, you've got the posters.

01:03:04.725 --> 01:03:07.946
I just need to get the permit,
then we're ready for tomorrow!

01:03:07.948 --> 01:03:09.659
Whoa!
What?

01:03:09.661 --> 01:03:13.117
Well, isn't this the story
you've been working on?

01:03:13.119 --> 01:03:14.192
Let me see!

01:03:14.194 --> 01:03:15.736
Jenkins wasn't kidding

01:03:15.738 --> 01:03:17.415
when he said he
was gonna go big.

01:03:17.417 --> 01:03:19.932
Huh! Wow!

01:03:19.934 --> 01:03:23.122
I wonder who's gonna
call first, huh?

01:03:23.124 --> 01:03:24.566
The mayor apologizing

01:03:24.568 --> 01:03:28.090
or Pendleton's lawyer,
threatening to sue.

01:03:28.092 --> 01:03:31.045
I guess I don't
need these anymore.

01:03:45.582 --> 01:03:47.631
Wait a minute!
I don't believe it.

01:03:47.633 --> 01:03:48.972
Believe what?

01:03:48.974 --> 01:03:51.928
1964 junior skating
pair champions,

01:03:51.930 --> 01:03:53.405
Ernie and Penelope.

01:03:53.407 --> 01:03:55.643
"Penny" is short for Penelope.

01:03:55.645 --> 01:03:57.316
I don't get it.

01:03:57.318 --> 01:03:59.554
It has to be him!
Who?

01:04:00.725 --> 01:04:02.396
Pendleton!

01:04:02.398 --> 01:04:04.634
Yeah, I mean...
It could be, I guess.

01:04:04.636 --> 01:04:06.171
But, so what?

01:04:06.173 --> 01:04:09.113
I think I made a huge mistake.

01:04:09.115 --> 01:04:11.585
Can you hold down
the fort for me?

01:04:13.492 --> 01:04:15.363
There's something I gotta do.

01:04:15.365 --> 01:04:17.535
Yeah...

01:04:29.469 --> 01:04:32.408
Ms. Hastings! I'm
surprised to see you here.

01:04:32.410 --> 01:04:34.582
I wouldn't have
bothered you, but...

01:04:34.584 --> 01:04:37.489
Apparently, your article's
caused quite a stir.

01:04:37.491 --> 01:04:40.865
The city council's decided
to launch an investigation.

01:04:40.867 --> 01:04:42.400
What a mess!

01:04:42.402 --> 01:04:45.543
Look, I know I'm the last
person you wanna talk to,

01:04:45.545 --> 01:04:47.849
but if you could...

01:04:47.851 --> 01:04:51.959
If you wouldn't mind answering a
couple more questions for me...

01:04:51.961 --> 01:04:54.065
Why bother?

01:04:54.067 --> 01:04:55.703
You got your headline.

01:04:55.705 --> 01:04:59.480
I did. But, just...

01:04:59.482 --> 01:05:01.685
I think I got it wrong.

01:05:12.749 --> 01:05:15.088
rday.

01:05:15.090 --> 01:05:17.026
For nearly 50 years,

01:05:17.028 --> 01:05:19.398
Penny was the light of my life.

01:05:19.400 --> 01:05:21.338
Was?

01:05:22.876 --> 01:05:25.482
I lost her 6 months ago.

01:05:25.484 --> 01:05:28.122
I'm sorry.
I didn't know.

01:05:29.393 --> 01:05:32.100
W-we grew up next
door to each other.

01:05:32.102 --> 01:05:34.005
Walked to school together,

01:05:34.007 --> 01:05:37.381
played, skated...

01:05:37.383 --> 01:05:41.825
We had our first
kiss on this rink.

01:05:41.827 --> 01:05:45.635
She... she loved
Greenwood Park.

01:05:45.637 --> 01:05:47.508
So, why build condos on it?

01:05:47.510 --> 01:05:49.680
Condos?

01:05:49.682 --> 01:05:53.289
No, Pendleton Towers is going
up by the old brickyard.

01:05:53.291 --> 01:05:56.129
But I know you were
planning on buying the park!

01:05:56.131 --> 01:06:00.341
To fix it up, and then donate
back to the city in trust,

01:06:00.343 --> 01:06:03.283
so it could always be a place

01:06:03.285 --> 01:06:07.360
where people come
together and have fun.

01:06:07.362 --> 01:06:10.836
Why didn't the mayor
tell me? Why didn't you?

01:06:10.838 --> 01:06:13.810
That's not what
Penny would've wanted.

01:06:13.812 --> 01:06:17.855
No, no plaques, no publicity,

01:06:17.857 --> 01:06:21.196
no names over the door.

01:06:21.198 --> 01:06:25.641
"The joy is in the
giving," she'd say,

01:06:25.643 --> 01:06:28.784
"not in the credit."

01:06:31.625 --> 01:06:34.732
Well, now that your gift
is no longer anonymous,

01:06:34.734 --> 01:06:37.740
are you still gonna go
through with the project?

01:06:37.742 --> 01:06:40.749
Even if I decided to go ahead,

01:06:40.751 --> 01:06:44.792
the city's reconsidering my
offer based on what you wrote.

01:06:47.166 --> 01:06:49.572
I'll make sure the
paper prints a retraction.

01:06:51.311 --> 01:06:52.880
Maybe that'll help.

01:07:00.769 --> 01:07:02.606
Mr. Pendleton,

01:07:02.608 --> 01:07:04.311
did you happen
to give a donation

01:07:04.313 --> 01:07:07.888
to the Christmas-tree
lighting campaign?

01:07:07.890 --> 01:07:13.001
Well, if I did, you
know I couldn't tell you.

01:07:14.706 --> 01:07:22.705
Ms. Hastings, what made
you bring me that picture?

01:07:45.387 --> 01:07:48.694
I wanna begin by saying
how truly sorry I am, Mr. Jenkins.

01:07:48.696 --> 01:07:52.740
And I assured Mr. Pendleton
that a retraction will go to print.

01:07:52.742 --> 01:07:55.178
A retraction is
not how I intend

01:07:55.180 --> 01:07:57.118
to kick off our holiday issue.

01:07:57.120 --> 01:07:59.657
I wanna be serving turkey,
not eating crow.

01:07:59.659 --> 01:08:01.232
But...

01:08:01.234 --> 01:08:03.475
Look, we can deal with
this in the new year,

01:08:03.477 --> 01:08:05.351
if anyone still cares
about it by then.

01:08:05.353 --> 01:08:07.629
This is a man's reputation!

01:08:07.631 --> 01:08:10.206
And I'm sure you feel
appropriately contrite

01:08:10.208 --> 01:08:11.581
about what you did to it.

01:08:11.583 --> 01:08:14.125
Of course I do!
Look, we'll wait.

01:08:14.127 --> 01:08:16.202
We'll see how many
letters we get.

01:08:17.274 --> 01:08:19.550
Anything else?

01:08:21.091 --> 01:08:23.603
You can expect
one letter for sure...

01:08:23.604 --> 01:08:25.712
my letter of resignation.

01:08:34.255 --> 01:08:36.496
Yuck!
How's it going?

01:08:36.497 --> 01:08:38.908
Not my best one!
It's a mountain of frosting.

01:08:38.910 --> 01:08:40.883
That's more of a
toupee right there.

01:08:40.885 --> 01:08:42.323
OK.

01:08:42.326 --> 01:08:45.404
Looks good!
Yes, it does.

01:08:45.406 --> 01:08:48.018
OK... Wow, it smells good!

01:08:48.020 --> 01:08:52.069
A little more happy sprinkles!

01:08:52.071 --> 01:08:53.542
How's it going?
Good!

01:08:53.544 --> 01:08:57.158
Let's see!
It's going out of control!

01:08:58.702 --> 01:09:00.341
Hey...

01:09:00.343 --> 01:09:03.555
Mom! What's going on?

01:09:03.557 --> 01:09:06.033
I didn't take you seriously
about Mr. Pendleton,

01:09:06.036 --> 01:09:08.982
and if I had, I wouldn't
have made the mistake

01:09:08.984 --> 01:09:11.157
that cost him his good name.

01:09:12.365 --> 01:09:13.870
We didn't get the permit.

01:09:13.872 --> 01:09:16.348
The mayor rejected it
himself, and he's having

01:09:16.350 --> 01:09:18.492
maintenance crews
take down the posters.

01:09:18.493 --> 01:09:20.335
What?

01:09:20.337 --> 01:09:22.511
I'm really sorry.

01:09:22.513 --> 01:09:23.884
How could they do that?

01:09:23.886 --> 01:09:26.060
You're just doing your
job as a journalist.

01:09:26.063 --> 01:09:29.510
Ex-journalist.
I just resigned.

01:09:35.339 --> 01:09:37.715
I've become such a skeptic.

01:09:39.625 --> 01:09:42.438
I nearly missed one of the
best parts of parenting:

01:09:42.439 --> 01:09:46.055
being reminded of what
I was like when I was a kid,

01:09:46.057 --> 01:09:49.335
before I became so jaded.

01:09:49.337 --> 01:09:51.782
You know, I couldn't
make myself believe

01:09:51.783 --> 01:09:54.126
that Kevin's friend was an elf,

01:09:54.127 --> 01:09:57.441
but I had no problem believing
that Mr. Pendleton was a crook.

01:09:58.882 --> 01:10:02.465
That's just not
the person I wanna be.

01:10:02.467 --> 01:10:05.110
And thanks to my
kid and Clementine

01:10:05.112 --> 01:10:08.425
and, well, you...

01:10:09.766 --> 01:10:11.875
it's gonna change,

01:10:11.877 --> 01:10:13.852
starting now.

01:10:19.913 --> 01:10:23.631
I think I just got
my first Christmas present.

01:10:25.607 --> 01:10:27.347
What you doing?

01:10:27.349 --> 01:10:29.725
Oh, just writing
about what I've learned

01:10:29.727 --> 01:10:31.299
in the last couple of days.

01:10:33.343 --> 01:10:37.059
It did get kind of crazy
around here, didn't it?

01:10:37.061 --> 01:10:38.801
Yeah.
Crazy fun!

01:10:38.803 --> 01:10:40.777
I love you.

01:10:40.779 --> 01:10:42.116
Ditto!

01:11:07.167 --> 01:11:08.607
Hey, stranger!

01:11:08.609 --> 01:11:10.449
I saw you'd cleaned
out your desk

01:11:10.451 --> 01:11:12.927
and thought you'd left
without saying goodbye.

01:11:12.929 --> 01:11:15.606
Well, that's one of the
reasons why I came back...

01:11:15.608 --> 01:11:17.080
and to ask you for a favour.

01:11:17.082 --> 01:11:18.519
What's on it?

01:11:18.521 --> 01:11:20.329
An unauthorized final column.

01:11:20.331 --> 01:11:22.036
I was hoping you could sneak it

01:11:22.038 --> 01:11:23.979
onto the online edition for me.

01:11:23.981 --> 01:11:26.792
Is it a rant about the
callous nature of the news biz?

01:11:26.794 --> 01:11:29.236
Uh, no!
Too bad!

01:11:29.238 --> 01:11:32.050
Yeah. You'll still sneak it
in for me though, right?

01:11:32.052 --> 01:11:34.561
Of course I will.
You're the best!

01:11:34.563 --> 01:11:38.948
Thank you!

01:11:44.912 --> 01:11:47.020
I've been looking
around for you!

01:11:47.022 --> 01:11:48.626
What are you doing?

01:11:50.772 --> 01:11:53.953
I was writing a
note to thank you...

01:11:54.890 --> 01:11:56.598
and to say goodbye.

01:11:57.504 --> 01:11:58.941
What?

01:11:58.943 --> 01:12:01.455
You promised to spend
Christmas Eve with me!

01:12:01.457 --> 01:12:04.334
Remember?
You can't bail!

01:12:04.336 --> 01:12:06.746
I don't know what
made me think that

01:12:06.748 --> 01:12:08.923
I could actually
make a difference.

01:12:08.925 --> 01:12:11.234
You did make a difference!

01:12:11.236 --> 01:12:12.840
To me!

01:12:13.980 --> 01:12:16.793
This is the most
dazzy Christmas ever!

01:12:16.795 --> 01:12:20.141
You made me believe
in you, Clementine.

01:12:20.143 --> 01:12:23.758
It's not fair to stop
believing in yourself.

01:12:32.433 --> 01:12:34.809
Mom...
Hi, honey!

01:12:35.915 --> 01:12:37.556
Is everything OK?

01:12:37.558 --> 01:12:39.431
Not so much.

01:12:39.433 --> 01:12:42.412
Clementine's pretty
worried about Northpole.

01:12:42.414 --> 01:12:46.364
I mean, I'd be freaking out
too if our home was in trouble.

01:12:46.366 --> 01:12:50.751
Hey... Did you just
call this place home?

01:12:50.753 --> 01:12:53.230
Oh... I guess I did!

01:12:54.805 --> 01:12:59.023
Let's go talk to Clementine.

01:12:59.025 --> 01:13:01.669
I'm glad you guys
decided to spend part of

01:13:01.671 --> 01:13:03.009
your Christmas Eve with us.

01:13:03.011 --> 01:13:05.386
So's my dog, otherwise,
he'd be wearing

01:13:05.388 --> 01:13:06.724
reindeer antlers again.

01:13:08.604 --> 01:13:10.007
How are you, Clementine?

01:13:12.419 --> 01:13:15.198
Look, I know things didn't
turn out how you'd hoped,

01:13:15.200 --> 01:13:17.743
but, if nothing else,
you and Kev became friends.

01:13:17.745 --> 01:13:19.753
And we had a good
time working together.

01:13:19.755 --> 01:13:22.967
Yeah! So, I'm sure that sent
some happiness to Northpole.

01:13:22.969 --> 01:13:25.380
Yeah, but not nearly enough.

01:13:25.382 --> 01:13:28.427
Then there's only
one thing to do.

01:13:28.429 --> 01:13:30.436
We need to make more sparks.

01:13:30.438 --> 01:13:32.546
Hmm!

01:13:37.638 --> 01:13:39.579
Oh, permit-schmermit!

01:13:39.581 --> 01:13:40.551
That's what I say.

01:13:41.925 --> 01:13:44.300
There's no law against
a few citizens enjoying

01:13:44.302 --> 01:13:46.277
a public park on Christmas Eve.

01:13:46.279 --> 01:13:49.224
And having our own,
personal tree ceremony!

01:13:49.226 --> 01:13:50.799
Yeah!

01:13:50.801 --> 01:13:56.023
I love the smell...

01:13:56.025 --> 01:13:58.232
All right, here you go.

01:13:58.234 --> 01:14:00.913
One for you!
Clementine, for you.

01:14:00.915 --> 01:14:03.423
Oh! Thank you!
You're welcome!

01:14:03.425 --> 01:14:06.003
Hey, I'll race you up there!

01:14:10.960 --> 01:14:14.643
You know, I feel better already!
Me too!

01:14:16.184 --> 01:14:17.992
They look like they could use

01:14:17.994 --> 01:14:20.067
a little company though,
don't you think?

01:14:20.069 --> 01:14:22.547
And, ta-da!

01:14:30.718 --> 01:14:33.028
Awesome!
Dazzy!

01:14:33.030 --> 01:14:34.469
Huh?

01:14:35.576 --> 01:14:37.182
Now it's perfect!

Well, lookie here!

01:15:06.989 --> 01:15:08.997
The human Christmas ornament!

01:15:08.999 --> 01:15:12.881
You, uh, have a permit
for this event?

01:15:12.883 --> 01:15:15.963
Actually, um,
not really. No.

01:15:15.965 --> 01:15:19.480
In that case,
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to

01:15:19.482 --> 01:15:22.828
break out the equipment and
string up the lights, anyhow.

01:15:22.830 --> 01:15:24.704
Yes!

01:15:26.647 --> 01:15:29.795

I'd forgotten all about this

until I read your column.

01:15:51.028 --> 01:15:52.601
It was wonderful!

01:15:52.603 --> 01:15:54.342
Thank you!

01:15:54.344 --> 01:15:56.050
Well, at least
one person read it!

01:15:56.052 --> 01:15:57.625
A few more than that!

01:15:57.627 --> 01:15:59.599
It got picked up
by the wire services.

01:15:59.601 --> 01:16:01.308
The wire services? Really?

01:16:01.310 --> 01:16:03.485
Almost a million hits
and not slowing down.

01:16:03.487 --> 01:16:05.495
Your story's flying
around the world

01:16:05.497 --> 01:16:07.772
faster than Santa's sleigh.

01:16:09.682 --> 01:16:12.829
Hey, if your story
went viral, then...

01:16:14.438 --> 01:16:16.479
Snow my gosh!

01:16:16.481 --> 01:16:18.320
I gotta go!

01:16:18.322 --> 01:16:19.525
Here!

01:16:19.527 --> 01:16:21.636
Wait... Hold on!

01:16:21.638 --> 01:16:23.444
Clementine!

01:16:23.446 --> 01:16:26.091
We gotta...
Yeah.

01:16:31.351 --> 01:16:34.262
Clementine!
Where are you going?

01:16:34.264 --> 01:16:36.237
Home!

01:16:36.239 --> 01:16:39.620
What about the
tree-lighting ceremony?

01:16:39.622 --> 01:16:43.773
Don't worry!
I'll know when it happens!

01:16:44.678 --> 01:16:47.289
Merry Christmas!

01:16:50.472 --> 01:16:52.682
Why, that is one special...

01:16:53.520 --> 01:16:56.398
elf!

01:16:56.400 --> 01:16:59.648
You're gonna see
exactly how special

01:16:59.650 --> 01:17:03.097
in 3, 2, 1!

01:17:09.428 --> 01:17:12.205
Did I just...
Was that...

01:17:12.207 --> 01:17:16.693
Guess this is one Christmas
you'll never forget!

01:17:16.695 --> 01:17:20.210
Merry Christmas, Mom.
Merry Christmas, sweetheart.

01:17:22.388 --> 01:17:23.786
I love you!

01:17:23.788 --> 01:17:26.485
Let me go put on my skates.
OK.

01:17:31.751 --> 01:17:36.148
Well, this is actually...
Uh-huh! Yeah...

01:17:38.215 --> 01:17:41.113
Where's the mistletoe
when you need it?

01:17:43.313 --> 01:17:45.545
You could use
your imagination.

01:17:45.547 --> 01:17:47.676
How about right here?

01:18:06.105 --> 01:18:07.836
<i>It's easy to forget</i>

01:18:07.838 --> 01:18:10.235
<i>what connecting with
one another feels like.</i>

01:18:10.237 --> 01:18:13.634
<i>With a few keystrokes
on a computer,</i>

01:18:13.636 --> 01:18:16.133
<i>we convince ourselves
that we've communicated.</i>

01:18:17.634 --> 01:18:19.664
<i>By believing that's enough,</i>

01:18:19.666 --> 01:18:24.063
<i>we lose sight of
the importance of human contact</i>

01:18:24.065 --> 01:18:27.562
<i>and the joy of gathering
together as a community.</i>

01:18:27.564 --> 01:18:28.761
How are you?

01:18:28.763 --> 01:18:30.194
<i>That's what's so wonderful</i>

01:18:30.196 --> 01:18:32.593
<i>about this special holiday.</i>

01:18:32.595 --> 01:18:34.826
<i>It provides an opportunity
for fellowship,</i>

01:18:34.828 --> 01:18:37.991
<i>a chance to truly touch
our neighbours,</i>

01:18:37.993 --> 01:18:42.389
<i>friends and families with
generosity of heart and spirit.</i>

01:18:42.391 --> 01:18:45.188
<i>And if you ask this reporter,</i>

01:18:45.190 --> 01:18:48.554
<i>it's nothing short of
miraculous.</i>

01:18:48.556 --> 01:18:50.553
You weren't kidding
when you said

01:18:50.555 --> 01:18:53.218
you skated worse than
you played the trumpet!

01:18:53.220 --> 01:18:56.017
Well, as long as I can hold
onto you, I'll be fine.

01:18:56.019 --> 01:18:57.984
Chelsea!
Whoa!

01:18:57.986 --> 01:18:59.617
Mr. Jenkins?

01:18:59.619 --> 01:19:02.582
The phone's been
ringing all day.

01:19:02.584 --> 01:19:06.480
The newspaper's never
had better, well, press.

01:19:06.482 --> 01:19:10.678
Um, Ryan, I'm sorry.
Kevin, this is Mr. Jenkins, my boss.

01:19:10.680 --> 01:19:13.177
Well, former boss.
Not so fast.

01:19:13.179 --> 01:19:16.110
Listen, Chelsea, I was wrong.

01:19:16.112 --> 01:19:18.209
We printed the retraction.

01:19:18.211 --> 01:19:21.774
And here's some confetti
for New Year's Eve.

01:19:21.776 --> 01:19:23.574
Your letter of resignation,

01:19:23.576 --> 01:19:25.572
rejected!

01:19:26.907 --> 01:19:28.972
Come and see me on Monday.

01:19:28.974 --> 01:19:30.604
I'm giving you a bonus!

01:19:30.606 --> 01:19:33.869
Christmas miracles
do happen, huh?

01:19:36.502 --> 01:19:38.501
I'll be right back!

01:19:40.867 --> 01:19:42.565
Mr. Pendleton!

01:19:42.567 --> 01:19:44.265
I'm really glad you came.

01:19:44.267 --> 01:19:45.831
So am I.

01:19:47.032 --> 01:19:49.064
Penny would've loved this.

01:19:49.066 --> 01:19:50.663
Friends, neighbours,

01:19:50.665 --> 01:19:54.562
reconnecting for at least
one special night.

01:19:54.564 --> 01:19:56.194
Evening, Ernie!

01:19:56.196 --> 01:19:58.594
Oh, Mr. Mayor.

01:19:58.596 --> 01:20:01.592
Sir, I owe you an apology.
I got it all wrong.

01:20:01.594 --> 01:20:03.524
Except for this.

01:20:03.526 --> 01:20:05.391
No, as far as I'm concerned,

01:20:05.393 --> 01:20:08.555
the no-longer-secret
project is still on.

01:20:08.557 --> 01:20:11.888
Well, most of the city
council is here skating,

01:20:11.890 --> 01:20:13.487
so I'm sure that after tonight,

01:20:13.489 --> 01:20:16.020
there'll be no problem
accepting your gift.

01:20:16.022 --> 01:20:17.386
Good.

01:20:18.686 --> 01:20:20.851
Mom, tree's ready to light!

01:20:20.853 --> 01:20:24.016
Hey, you must be Kevin!
Yes, sir.

01:20:24.018 --> 01:20:26.715
Well, word is, getting
our community together

01:20:26.717 --> 01:20:29.214
to celebrate Christmas
was all your doing.

01:20:29.216 --> 01:20:32.480
Actually, I had
quite a bit of help.

01:20:32.482 --> 01:20:35.913
Well, still, I think you
should do the honours.

01:20:40.178 --> 01:20:43.976
Gather around,
everybody! Gather around!

01:20:43.978 --> 01:20:47.541
You rock, Kevin!
Whoo! Awesome!

01:20:47.543 --> 01:20:50.340
Merry Christmas to all,

01:20:50.342 --> 01:20:54.605
and to all, a good... light!

01:21:00.304 --> 01:21:02.602
Beautiful!

01:21:02.604 --> 01:21:05.767
Oh! Beautiful!

01:21:06.635 --> 01:21:08.833
Yes!

We did it!

01:22:42.899 --> 01:22:44.430
We did it!

01:22:44.432 --> 01:22:48.628
Whoo-hoo!

01:22:48.630 --> 01:22:50.927
Whoo-hoo!

01:22:50.929 --> 01:22:52.827
That a girl, Clementine!

01:22:52.829 --> 01:22:55.260
I told you she could do it!

01:22:55.262 --> 01:22:58.757
And as always, my dear,
you were absolutely right.

01:22:58.759 --> 01:23:01.723
Oh!

01:23:01.725 --> 01:23:08.420
It's time to deliver
a sleighful of happiness!

01:23:08.422 --> 01:23:11.852
Put her down
over there, Randy!

01:23:20.216 --> 01:23:21.716
It's so dazzy!

01:23:30.678 --> 01:23:33.877
Merry Christmas, Northpole!

01:23:33.879 --> 01:23:38.009
Merry Christmas,
everyone, everywhere!

01:23:47.440 --> 01:23:49.571
Ho ho ho!
