WEBVTT

00:08.422 --> 00:11.026
- You should have worn the gumboots.
- I'm fine! You know, I'm...

00:11.255 --> 00:12.428
I'm agile...

00:13.575 --> 00:17.012
So, Hodgins asked
Angela to marry him.

00:17.270 --> 00:18.312
Twice.

00:18.433 --> 00:22.187
Oh, and she turned him down? Both times?

00:22.188 --> 00:23.770
I heard all this from Angela.

00:23.770 --> 00:25.930
Yeah, but did she tell you
that he said that he was...

00:26.352 --> 00:28.036
he wasn't gonna ask
her to marry him?

00:28.199 --> 00:31.045
- Yes.
- And she said...

00:31.643 --> 00:32.932
"I'd like to marry you. "

00:33.050 --> 00:35.164
Kind of sudden, Bones.
Let me think about it.

00:35.453 --> 00:38.464
What? No, Booth, that's
what Angela told Hodgins.

00:40.347 --> 00:41.239
You're joking.

00:41.908 --> 00:44.089
You know, a lot of
psychologists say that jokes

00:44.311 --> 00:45.883
are the way we manifest
our hidden desires.

00:46.035 --> 00:47.128
Yeah...

00:47.654 --> 00:48.498
Geez!

00:48.710 --> 00:50.692
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

00:51.111 --> 00:52.049
What do we got?

00:52.225 --> 00:55.075
During a foot pursuit last
night, suspect tosses a knife

00:55.240 --> 00:57.715
into this muck in an effort
to avoid incarceration.

00:57.851 --> 00:59.927
The effluent gets drained,
we start finding stuff.

01:00.208 --> 01:01.335
Define "stuff. "

01:01.569 --> 01:03.669
Stuff... cell phones,

01:03.915 --> 01:05.792
guns, knives, crack vials.

01:05.986 --> 01:08.942
Evidently, you want to lose something
in this vicinity, you toss it in here.

01:09.106 --> 01:11.370
The miscreants probably think
it's some sort of bottomless pit.

01:11.519 --> 01:13.994
Does the word "concise"
mean anything to you?

01:14.264 --> 01:15.789
Well, we found that.

01:16.023 --> 01:16.997
Concise enough?

01:24.551 --> 01:25.654
Small.

01:27.730 --> 01:28.715
Is it a kid?

01:29.325 --> 01:30.334
Female.

01:30.663 --> 01:34.709
Pelvic girdle and skull
sutures suggest preadolescent.

01:37.399 --> 01:39.885
- A child's pencil case.
- How long has she been dead?

01:40.097 --> 01:41.863
Does this freeze over in the winter?

01:41.864 --> 01:44.295
Yeah. Solid.

01:44.295 --> 01:47.293
It's possible she was placed
here as long ago as last fall.

01:47.566 --> 01:49.047
Cause of death?

01:49.082 --> 01:51.545
It looks like a gunshot
wound to the back of the head.

01:51.780 --> 01:54.243
- Can you guess the caliber?
- Nothing larger than a 22.

01:54.413 --> 01:56.032
- Find any 22s?
- Two.

01:56.208 --> 01:59.607
All right, let's get an FBI forensic team
down here and search for bullet fragments.

01:59.832 --> 02:01.463
I'll go call it in right now.

02:09.983 --> 02:11.003
"I love you."

02:12.165 --> 02:16.285
You said that pedophiles can delude themselves
into thinking they love their victims.

02:20.614 --> 02:23.705
A nice traditional church
service. Very ecumenical.

02:23.939 --> 02:24.995
That's great.

02:25.171 --> 02:27.494
As long as the reception
makes Caligula blush.

02:27.717 --> 02:29.570
Let's hope he got his invitation.

02:31.171 --> 02:33.740
- Hey, what are those?
- They were found in this case.

02:33.998 --> 02:35.588
Probably belonged to the victim.

02:35.740 --> 02:38.039
And these are water samples
teeming with organisms.

02:38.203 --> 02:40.960
I found an inordinately large
number of dead fairy shrimp

02:41.133 --> 02:42.634
in the mud beneath the remains.

02:42.834 --> 02:45.139
I will not make a "clap
for Tinkerbell" joke.

02:48.033 --> 02:50.016
How about we not discuss child murder

02:50.145 --> 02:52.233
and our upcoming nuptials
in the same conversation.

02:52.473 --> 02:53.705
That's a good idea.

02:56.679 --> 02:59.764
Hey, do you want me
to... change my name?

03:01.481 --> 03:04.566
Do you want me to want
you to change your name?

03:15.371 --> 03:17.482
Do you know what you're looking at?

03:18.286 --> 03:19.389
The neck bone.

03:19.729 --> 03:22.345
That's... connected
to the shoulder bone.

03:23.661 --> 03:28.055
There's arthritic lipping here
and here, on the posterior dens.

03:28.389 --> 03:30.723
Arthritis? For this
to occur she had to...

03:30.969 --> 03:33.233
she had to look up like this.

03:33.890 --> 03:36.705
- Maybe she prayed a lot.
- Four to six hour a day?

03:36.881 --> 03:38.477
What did she want so badly?

03:38.981 --> 03:39.931
Her father?

03:42.263 --> 03:43.142
Hey, baby.

03:43.307 --> 03:44.092
Dad.

03:44.327 --> 03:45.078
Booth.

03:45.488 --> 03:46.972
- Put your hands up.
- Booth!

03:47.136 --> 03:50.022
I was hoping that we could get a
drink or something before this part.

03:50.186 --> 03:52.908
Max Keenan, you're under
arrest as an escaped felon.

03:53.368 --> 03:55.562
Oh, okay, so I guess that's
"no" on the drink, huh?

03:55.820 --> 03:58.037
Bones, grab the cuffs out
of my back pocket there.

03:58.224 --> 03:59.749
- No.
- What do you mean no? Bones...

03:59.937 --> 04:02.371
It's okay, baby. I don't want
to handcuff my own father.

04:02.547 --> 04:03.943
Plus, remember when he saved your life?

04:04.130 --> 04:05.808
Hey, just throw them over
here. I'll do it myself.

04:06.019 --> 04:08.353
He's telling me what to do.
Put your hands on the wall.

04:09.553 --> 04:12.450
- Dad, what are you doing here?
- I heard you were getting married.

04:12.696 --> 04:13.874
What? No.

04:14.174 --> 04:16.825
Angela's getting married
to Hodgins, not me.

04:17.017 --> 04:18.555
Oh, the bug guy.

04:18.825 --> 04:20.983
- Well, that's great.
- Will you shut up, please?

04:22.980 --> 04:24.599
long enough for me to mirandize him.

04:24.716 --> 04:26.440
You got the right to
remain silent. Got it.

04:26.698 --> 04:28.962
- We'll talk more later.
- Look, I'm sorry, Bones,

04:29.153 --> 04:31.980
but he killed the Deputy Director
of the FBI. I'm just doing my job.

04:32.226 --> 04:33.059
It's okay.

04:35.487 --> 04:36.402
He's right.

04:37.605 --> 04:38.672
Kisses, baby.

04:42.141 --> 04:45.250
Uh, sweetie... was that your dad?

05:20.988 --> 05:22.877
What do you mean that's not Max Keenan?

05:23.147 --> 05:26.771
Cherie, you know that's Max Keenan,
and I know that's Max Keenan,

05:26.988 --> 05:30.132
but to the rest of the world, that
man is a hardworking electrician

05:30.238 --> 05:32.171
from Coos Bay, Oregon,
named Art McGregor.

05:32.271 --> 05:35.777
That electrician was a bank robber for
15 years and murdered two FBI agents.

05:35.894 --> 05:38.358
Only one was still an agent
at the time of his demise.

05:38.460 --> 05:40.189
The guy was Deputy Director!

05:40.189 --> 05:44.525
And a crooked, murdering son of a
bitch, not to speak ill of the dead.

05:44.801 --> 05:48.191
Driver's license, credit
cards, tax returns...

05:48.361 --> 05:50.762
And this library card
was issued 11 years ago.

05:50.862 --> 05:52.525
- A complete history?
- Yes.

05:52.748 --> 05:54.777
We'll keep digging, but
Cherie, I don't know.

05:55.988 --> 05:57.361
I gotta cut that guy loose?

05:57.361 --> 06:03.828
Legally speaking, that man is a law-abiding,
tax-paying, fully certified, dues-paying member

06:03.980 --> 06:05.877
-  of the international brotherhood of...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

06:07.745 --> 06:09.352
since 1984.

06:14.935 --> 06:17.492
Tell me something, Max, on a job site,

06:18.407 --> 06:21.621
what's the most hazardous
classification for an electrician?

06:21.914 --> 06:24.776
Class 1, Division 1. You
planning a career change?

06:27.043 --> 06:28.545
Ah, you're checking out my prints.

06:28.756 --> 06:31.747
Max, you know I like you
and I hate to hurt Bones, but

06:32.014 --> 06:33.621
it's my job to catch you.

06:34.627 --> 06:35.987
And I'm very good at my job.

06:36.254 --> 06:39.445
You'd have to be to work with
my daughter. What do you say?

06:40.237 --> 06:42.043
Shake hands with an old con.

06:42.395 --> 06:44.424
Or is that bad for the FBI image?

06:44.738 --> 06:46.509
You abandoned her as a child.

06:47.304 --> 06:48.864
You don't think she feels that,

06:49.099 --> 06:52.630
every time you pop in
and out of her life?

06:57.806 --> 07:00.011
You're just saying that so I'll hit you.

07:00.457 --> 07:02.087
Then you got a reason to lock me up.

07:03.421 --> 07:04.970
20 years ago...

07:05.715 --> 07:07.134
that would have worked.

07:09.653 --> 07:14.404
Your estimate was correct. This hole
is consistent with a 22 caliber slug.

07:14.847 --> 07:16.888
I learned "slug" from Cam. It's a...

07:17.119 --> 07:18.902
colloquialism for projectile.

07:19.216 --> 07:21.703
Which so far the FBI
has been unable to find.

07:21.853 --> 07:25.888
Okay, I have a face, but
you are not going to like it.

07:32.649 --> 07:34.467
That is an old woman.

07:34.781 --> 07:38.394
I provided you with the tissue data
for a ten-year-old Caucasian female.

07:38.625 --> 07:41.276
Well, when I actually held
the skull and started...

07:41.388 --> 07:43.476
the tissue markers felt wrong.

07:43.825 --> 07:48.282
Angela, with all due respect to your
art, facial reconstruction is a science.

07:48.470 --> 07:50.769
It's both, babe, and this time

07:51.062 --> 07:53.244
art made science her bitch.

07:54.068 --> 07:56.109
Hey, moan all you want. I stand by this.

07:56.337 --> 07:59.434
We should recheck for other
indications that we got the age wrong.

07:59.745 --> 08:01.493
Because art made science her bitch?

08:01.622 --> 08:03.780
Because the lipping on the
vertebrae had to have been caused

08:03.921 --> 08:06.337
by looking up over a
period of several years.

08:06.654 --> 08:09.000
That's a scientific
rationale for rechecking.

08:12.560 --> 08:13.440
Hey, Brennan.

08:13.836 --> 08:15.326
I'd like to ask you a favor.

08:15.701 --> 08:18.845
Well, it's not so much ask a
favor as, as extend an honor.

08:19.170 --> 08:21.153
I mean, I hope you
see it as an honor and

08:21.353 --> 08:23.023
don't think of it as some onerous duty,

08:23.140 --> 08:25.326
which I don't think you will, but then
again I've never done this before...

08:25.426 --> 08:27.179
Angela... just ask.

08:27.525 --> 08:29.191
Will you be my maid of honor?

08:30.502 --> 08:31.487
At the wedding?

08:36.255 --> 08:38.073
- Is that yes?
- I am...

08:38.552 --> 08:41.695
- completely, totally honored.
- Really?

08:41.845 --> 08:43.557
- I thought I'd have to tell you...
- I don't even care

08:43.672 --> 08:46.100
how awful the bridesmaid
dresses are. I'm...

08:46.801 --> 08:48.255
so glad you asked me.

08:50.434 --> 08:53.977
I have your brother set up in a
little auto supply place. It's a...

08:54.264 --> 08:56.364
shade-tree mechanic situation.

08:56.587 --> 08:58.499
You set him up where? Oregon?

08:59.261 --> 09:01.502
It's better that you
don't know. He's, uh,

09:01.801 --> 09:05.074
- in violation of his parole.
- Because you made him leave the state.

09:05.341 --> 09:07.945
Your brother is on a slippery slope

09:08.261 --> 09:11.511
and... yeah, I know,
I know, the irony of me

09:11.681 --> 09:15.036
being a good influence,
but it's true, I am.

09:15.385 --> 09:17.015
It's nice to see you smile.

09:17.414 --> 09:18.575
That's, that's something.

09:23.411 --> 09:25.910
Booth is going to find
proof of who you are.

09:26.203 --> 09:28.525
- Then he'll arrest you.
- Not tonight.

09:32.458 --> 09:35.426
Did you come here just to
tell me that Russ is okay?

09:35.681 --> 09:38.097
No, actually, I have
something for you that...

09:38.484 --> 09:40.959
that belonged to your grandmother.

09:43.672 --> 09:45.303
I have a grandmother?

09:45.772 --> 09:49.432
I know your mother and I told you that
you didn't have grandparents, but...

09:51.209 --> 09:52.288
Try it on.

10:01.675 --> 10:04.021
I... I have to go to bed.

10:04.297 --> 10:07.546
There are some inconsistencies
with the remains,

10:07.933 --> 10:10.807
which I have to address
first thing in the morning.

10:11.121 --> 10:11.754
Okay.

10:14.341 --> 10:15.525
You're welcome...

10:15.866 --> 10:18.071
to stay here if... you want.

10:19.253 --> 10:21.024
The couch would be great.

10:21.259 --> 10:24.191
No, Dad, I, I made up the guest room

10:24.901 --> 10:27.176
in case you...

10:30.552 --> 10:31.701
Good night.

10:45.173 --> 10:47.003
His fingerprints don't match?

10:47.704 --> 10:49.100
There's nothing to compare them to.

10:49.346 --> 10:52.631
Max Keenan got himself
wiped from the system?

10:52.988 --> 10:53.815
That's right.

10:53.932 --> 10:55.894
Who is this guy? Some
sort of super-criminal?

10:56.058 --> 10:59.659
It must have been Deputy Director
Kirby. Yeah, he wanted Max dead, so...

10:59.861 --> 11:01.597
he made him invisible first.

11:02.254 --> 11:03.967
That would be an ironic twist,

11:04.178 --> 11:07.275
seeing as how you want to
arrest Max for Kirby's murder.

11:11.219 --> 11:14.093
You don't have doubts about
catching this guy, do you? I mean,

11:14.304 --> 11:16.932
- he is your partner's father.
- No.

11:18.791 --> 11:20.023
Bones gets it.

11:20.574 --> 11:22.005
You hope she does.

11:26.278 --> 11:29.363
I'll get you a warrant to
collect a DNA sample from the man.

11:29.609 --> 11:31.803
You, find something to compare it to.

11:36.266 --> 11:38.495
No wisdom teeth suggests prepubescence.

11:38.677 --> 11:40.917
The lower bone plate and
the radius have not fused.

11:41.081 --> 11:43.545
Angela's wrong. The
victim was not yet 20.

11:44.590 --> 11:45.600
What?

11:45.671 --> 11:49.718
The arthritic lipping on the vertebrae,
degeneration in the collarbone,

11:49.926 --> 11:52.331
spiking on the superior
articular process.

11:52.551 --> 11:56.398
And all the large bones in her body show
osteolytis and advanced deterioration.

11:56.583 --> 11:59.785
- Meaning Angela was right.
- Meaning you were not wrong,

11:59.982 --> 12:02.070
which is not the same as being right.

12:02.222 --> 12:03.407
Progeria...

12:04.891 --> 12:06.451
She had one of the aging diseases.

12:06.709 --> 12:10.029
Anyone want to hear about the hit
my sketch got off the NCIC database?

12:11.993 --> 12:14.809
Chelsea Cole... age 22,

12:15.254 --> 12:17.319
went missing last November.

12:17.993 --> 12:19.565
Good, Angela.

12:20.551 --> 12:21.876
Really good.

12:30.215 --> 12:32.174
- Zack?
- I really should've thought of that.

12:32.373 --> 12:35.177
A disease which prevents the
sufferer from entering puberty,

12:35.294 --> 12:37.476
but simultaneously ages her otherwise.

12:37.708 --> 12:39.663
I'd like to ask you to be
my best man on Saturday.

12:39.763 --> 12:42.346
Things aren't always either-or.
Sometimes they're both.

12:42.651 --> 12:43.765
At my wedding.

12:45.378 --> 12:46.305
Saturday.

12:48.449 --> 12:49.575
To Angela.

12:51.625 --> 12:52.856
My best man.

12:54.179 --> 12:57.100
- When do I have to decide?
- You have to think about it?

12:57.323 --> 12:58.191
Yes.

12:59.255 --> 13:00.100
Fine.

13:01.719 --> 13:03.302
Let me know what you decide.

13:10.751 --> 13:12.510
You found her in a shopping cart?

13:13.959 --> 13:16.153
- Yes.
- From Tuft's Grocery?

13:16.458 --> 13:17.748
How did you know that?

13:18.194 --> 13:19.777
Chelsea loved Tuft's.

13:20.698 --> 13:25.144
Give her a dollar and she'd go
down there and buy a candy bar

13:25.554 --> 13:27.044
or some cheap toy.

13:27.390 --> 13:30.393
Everybody knew Chelsea,
walking along with one

13:30.672 --> 13:34.355
small thing in a big cart,
bringing it home to show me.

13:34.833 --> 13:36.334
Did Chelsea draw these?

13:37.578 --> 13:38.258
Yes.

13:40.458 --> 13:43.601
She's 22 years old. These are
the drawings of a young child.

13:43.950 --> 13:45.522
Chelsea had a...

13:46.367 --> 13:48.525
- condition.
- Werner's syndrome.

13:49.258 --> 13:51.112
- How did you know?
- What's that?

13:51.367 --> 13:55.754
It's an aging disease in which
mental development can be a factor.

13:58.807 --> 14:00.566
Your daughter spent...

14:01.059 --> 14:03.721
a long time looking up. Correct?

14:04.024 --> 14:06.534
Chelsea was obsessed with the stars.

14:08.241 --> 14:12.475
She thought they were signals
from heaven, showing people...

14:12.921 --> 14:13.930
the way home.

14:15.543 --> 14:19.859
Mrs. Cole, when Chelsea disappeared,
you gave the police a name?

14:20.255 --> 14:21.534
Joe Mellon.

14:21.809 --> 14:26.266
He was a caretaker provided by the city while
I was going to classes at community college.

14:26.621 --> 14:28.721
One night I came home from class

14:29.574 --> 14:33.738
and her hair smelled like
the shampoo I use... lemons.

14:34.084 --> 14:37.287
I always use baby shampoo on Chelsea.

14:39.416 --> 14:42.125
That, that wasn't part of
his job... bathing Chelsea?

14:42.301 --> 14:43.815
Definitely not!

14:45.184 --> 14:48.492
I complained to Child
Services, and they...

14:48.897 --> 14:50.609
launched an investigation.

14:50.750 --> 14:53.518
Which ended as soon
as Chelsea disappeared?

14:53.706 --> 14:55.055
I guess so.

14:55.460 --> 14:57.782
No victim... no crime.

15:01.779 --> 15:03.469
I absolutely...

15:03.879 --> 15:06.002
did not molest Chelsea Cole.

15:06.313 --> 15:09.340
- Why'd Child Services let you go?
- They didn't let me go.

15:09.545 --> 15:12.020
They reassigned me because they
knew I didn't do anything wrong.

15:13.366 --> 15:15.149
What did you not do wrong, Joe?

15:17.128 --> 15:20.999
Chelsea Cole had the mental
capacity of a six-year-old.

15:21.263 --> 15:24.606
She got jam all over her and
freaked out from being sticky.

15:24.908 --> 15:26.375
That's why I ran her a bath.

15:26.818 --> 15:28.483
And I sat outside

15:28.647 --> 15:31.510
the bathroom door and made her
talk to me while she was in the tub.

15:31.870 --> 15:35.225
She used her mom's shampoo and
it stung her eyes. She cried.

15:35.645 --> 15:39.058
I went in and rinsed
the soap out of her eyes

15:39.381 --> 15:41.973
and then I went back out
and let her get dressed,

15:42.161 --> 15:44.870
which is what she told her
mother, who did not listen.

15:45.031 --> 15:47.283
Then why is Cynthia Cole so insistent

15:47.541 --> 15:49.770
that you were inappropriate
with her daughter?

15:50.049 --> 15:52.946
I crossed the line, man. I...

15:54.055 --> 15:58.782
suggested that Cynthia consider
an alternate solution for Chelsea.

15:59.116 --> 16:00.582
What? Like an institution?

16:00.747 --> 16:03.398
The woman was exhausted. She,
she was looking like crap.

16:03.547 --> 16:07.348
She was failing all of her college
courses. She couldn't hold onto a job.

16:07.802 --> 16:09.538
Everything was going downhill.

16:11.280 --> 16:12.148
Listen, Joe.

16:13.811 --> 16:16.673
I want you to look me
in the eye, and tell me

16:17.248 --> 16:19.711
that you never touched that little girl.

16:20.197 --> 16:21.722
I wiped the soap

16:22.497 --> 16:23.693
out of her eyes.

16:24.200 --> 16:26.089
And I wrapped a towel around her.

16:27.227 --> 16:28.142
That's it.

16:32.898 --> 16:35.936
This ring was passed down from
oldest daughter to oldest daughter.

16:36.107 --> 16:38.019
It was a tradition in your
mother's side of the family.

16:38.241 --> 16:41.444
You told Russ and me that
we didn't have any relatives.

16:41.661 --> 16:46.071
Well, honey, we were underground. We
had new names. We had to tell you that.

16:49.561 --> 16:50.722
What's the truth?

16:52.241 --> 16:54.036
Your mother's the
oldest of three sisters,

16:54.329 --> 16:55.502
and if you want to seek them out,

16:55.655 --> 16:58.705
you show them the ring, they'll know who
you are and accept you into the family.

16:58.957 --> 17:00.283
What about on your side?

17:00.585 --> 17:04.115
Your mother was the only family
I ever knew. And you and Russ.

17:05.479 --> 17:08.517
You abandoned me for 15 years.

17:08.936 --> 17:12.174
And I'll do whatever
I can to make repairs.

17:12.582 --> 17:15.396
- While running away from the FBI?
- I have more.

17:15.675 --> 17:18.994
A message from your
mother. On videotape.

17:20.083 --> 17:23.884
- Well... what does she say?
- I don't know. It's for you.

17:24.724 --> 17:26.039
When you're ready.

17:28.588 --> 17:32.154
I am sorry to interrupt, but
I have a warrant here to...

17:32.338 --> 17:38.696
take a DNA sample from you, Mr.
Arthur McGregor from Coos Bay, Oregon.

17:42.209 --> 17:43.171
I'm really sorry.

17:50.356 --> 17:51.212
Zack?

17:51.338 --> 17:54.071
There's a recalcification
around this hole.

17:54.550 --> 17:55.922
It healed.

17:56.608 --> 17:58.626
Zack, I'm getting married Saturday.

17:59.330 --> 18:00.984
Two short days, man.

18:01.805 --> 18:03.365
I need to know if
you'll stand up with me.

18:07.887 --> 18:11.441
I don't need a formal response.
A simple "yes" would...

18:13.098 --> 18:13.931
Iraq?

18:17.620 --> 18:19.192
You can't go to Iraq.

18:19.646 --> 18:22.626
- The president is asking me personally.
- No.

18:22.907 --> 18:26.708
Not personally. The president
has a machine to sign for him.

18:27.242 --> 18:31.235
He's probably talking to every forensic
anthropologist in the country. You can't go to Iraq.

18:31.663 --> 18:32.332
No.

18:33.546 --> 18:37.792
No way. You, you stay here and you be
my best man. You let someone else go.

18:38.031 --> 18:40.049
He's says I'm at the
forefront of my field,

18:40.342 --> 18:43.028
- that my country needs me.
- You can't go to Iraq.

18:43.427 --> 18:44.295
Zack.

18:45.345 --> 18:47.445
Will you be my best man or not?

18:47.891 --> 18:48.759
No.

18:50.489 --> 18:51.896
- Why?
- Because,

18:52.061 --> 18:55.415
if I decide to do what the president
wants, and go to Iraq and get killed,

18:55.785 --> 18:58.178
you won't be able to remember
your wedding with happiness.

18:58.292 --> 19:00.228
Okay, big assumption there, buddy.

19:00.439 --> 19:03.231
Rationally speaking, I'm
not good at social ritual.

19:03.653 --> 19:04.990
You should ask Booth.

19:05.257 --> 19:07.509
Everything isn't rational.

19:07.861 --> 19:08.976
It should be.

19:10.049 --> 19:12.935
I no longer believe
this is a bullet hole.

19:13.459 --> 19:16.099
I believe this was created by a drill.

19:20.377 --> 19:22.888
Chelsea had brain surgery
when she was three.

19:23.245 --> 19:27.374
- They had to drill into her skull?
- Yes, to relieve the pressure.

19:27.803 --> 19:30.477
- These are accurate.
- I beg your pardon?

19:30.720 --> 19:32.761
These are all constellations.

19:33.219 --> 19:37.113
Centaurus, Aquarius... Gemini.

19:37.530 --> 19:41.694
I knew Chelsea loved the stars but I
never thought her drawings were actually...

19:42.380 --> 19:44.902
- They're real?
- This one's Delphinius.

19:45.090 --> 19:46.978
The Dolphin. It was...

19:47.832 --> 19:51.034
my favorite when I was a child. My
mother and I both loved dolphins.

19:51.172 --> 19:53.190
So that was something that we...

19:56.278 --> 19:57.298
shared.

19:58.715 --> 20:01.342
Mrs. Cole, why exactly did...

20:01.588 --> 20:03.723
your daughter require brain surgery?

20:04.072 --> 20:05.691
Why do you ask it like that?

20:06.770 --> 20:09.996
- You think I did something to Chelsea.
- Head injuries are...

20:10.166 --> 20:14.025
extremely common in children
who are physically abused.

20:16.119 --> 20:19.439
Excuse me, but it's very important
that I take my medication on time.

20:23.363 --> 20:26.119
My daughter, at age
three, fell out of bed.

20:26.970 --> 20:29.656
She didn't stop crying until
I took her to the hospital.

20:29.841 --> 20:32.553
She had the surgery. It
was because of that injury

20:32.653 --> 20:35.108
that they discovered that
she had the aging disease.

20:36.703 --> 20:39.659
Did Joe Mellon tell you that
I physically abused my daughter

20:39.788 --> 20:41.512
because I grabbed her arm once?

20:43.647 --> 20:44.504
Once?

20:50.383 --> 20:52.342
- Booth.
- Dude...

20:52.750 --> 20:55.237
- will you stand up for me on Saturday?
- Against who?

20:55.504 --> 20:57.076
No. I mean...

20:57.369 --> 20:58.647
be my best man?

20:59.090 --> 21:00.873
Sure. Wow.

21:01.084 --> 21:02.410
I know. Big honor.

21:02.641 --> 21:05.210
No, no, no. Yeah, that, but, you
know, you didn't give me much time to

21:05.375 --> 21:07.650
- put a bachelor party together.
- No bachelor party.

21:07.902 --> 21:10.307
- Is that Hodgins?
- Yeah. He wants me to be his best man.

21:10.471 --> 21:12.196
Well, if there's no bachelor
party what do you want me to do?

21:12.383 --> 21:14.436
Stand there. Make a toast.

21:14.595 --> 21:16.014
Hand over the ring.

21:16.304 --> 21:19.436
Tongue-kiss the maid of honor at the
reception when people clink glasses.

21:19.577 --> 21:21.348
Nice. Excellent. Okay,
who's the maid of honor?

21:21.466 --> 21:24.712
No idea, but most of Angela's
friends are really hot.

21:25.015 --> 21:27.146
Well, I'm the maid of honor.

21:27.662 --> 21:28.693
Why?

21:29.584 --> 21:33.476
Uh, listen, do you need me to, uh,
connect with the bride's father?

21:33.531 --> 21:37.264
Put together the, uh, the
toast, the speeches and all that?

21:38.731 --> 21:39.969
Hodgins, you there?

21:41.052 --> 21:42.496
Angela's father.

21:43.015 --> 21:44.871
Oh, I forgot all about him.

21:46.628 --> 21:48.705
- She has AIDS.
- Angela?

21:48.825 --> 21:52.524
Cynthia Cole, the victim's
mother. HIV or AIDS.

21:52.617 --> 21:54.157
What, all that medicine she took?

21:54.223 --> 21:55.969
I recognized one of them.

21:56.231 --> 21:57.358
We'll ask Cam.

21:57.946 --> 21:59.789
In the mud sample taken
from beneath the remains,

21:59.790 --> 22:02.567
I found a high concentration
of dead anostraca.

22:02.568 --> 22:04.293
Also known as "fairy shrimp."

22:04.294 --> 22:05.737
Shrimp can live outside the ocean?

22:05.738 --> 22:08.093
They're not actually shrimp; they're
brachiopods. Main differences being...

22:08.094 --> 22:09.670
- Moving on.
- I want to know if they can be poisoned

22:09.671 --> 22:11.922
by feeding on decomposing flesh.

22:15.185 --> 22:16.483
Oh, God.

22:16.667 --> 22:18.795
- Please tell me that is not...
- That's not human.

22:19.166 --> 22:20.308
That's Spam.

22:20.355 --> 22:23.688
Which has been injected with
a number of organic poisons.

22:25.996 --> 22:29.531
We'd like to introduce a
colony of Artemia Salina.

22:29.594 --> 22:31.221
Commonly referred to

22:31.222 --> 22:32.688
as sea chimps.

22:32.762 --> 22:36.501
If they die, I can check to see if running them
through the spectrometer reveals what poisoned them.

22:36.591 --> 22:37.937
What do you want from me?

22:38.187 --> 22:39.408
Permission.

22:40.198 --> 22:41.840
- Why?
- Because you said

22:41.841 --> 22:45.345
you'd fire us if we did any more
experiments without clearing them first.

22:45.951 --> 22:46.952
Boys,

22:47.465 --> 22:50.375
you've got Spam and sea chimps.

22:51.091 --> 22:53.844
You get anything out
of that, and I will...

22:54.576 --> 22:56.359
buy you each a car.

22:59.371 --> 23:01.733
- Release the hounds.
- What?

23:02.375 --> 23:04.065
Pour in the sea chimps.

23:22.014 --> 23:24.939
I found that anticlimactic.

23:26.809 --> 23:27.967
Yeah.

23:29.934 --> 23:32.594
- Do you like your father?
- Love my father.

23:33.967 --> 23:36.016
I think I love my father.

23:36.357 --> 23:37.827
Well, that's normal.

23:37.828 --> 23:40.561
But he ran out on me and Russ.

23:40.562 --> 23:42.267
He robbed people.

23:43.119 --> 23:44.731
He's a murderer.

23:45.419 --> 23:49.158
He got my mother killed. You
know, how does he expect me to...?

23:50.465 --> 23:53.156
It's hard to trust someone
who's abandoned you.

23:53.393 --> 23:55.255
Especially a parent.

23:57.461 --> 23:59.088
Am I...

24:00.316 --> 24:02.350
Am I terrible for not...

24:03.457 --> 24:06.476
wanting to let myself
care about my own father?

24:07.845 --> 24:12.054
Look, Bones, your father is going to do
something tomorrow that's going to hurt you.

24:12.473 --> 24:14.100
How do you forgive that?

24:14.190 --> 24:16.255
I'm not a bad daughter?

24:17.205 --> 24:18.676
Bad person?

24:21.336 --> 24:23.088
You're not a bad anything.

24:33.351 --> 24:35.917
Hodgins figured out
what killed Chelsea Cole.

24:36.267 --> 24:39.389
Branchinecta Lindahli. Also
known as the fairy shrimp.

24:39.390 --> 24:41.731
Not a true shrimp,
actually, a branchiopod.

24:41.804 --> 24:44.438
You want to hurry it up there,
Hodgins? I got a tux I need to rent.

24:44.538 --> 24:47.432
Right. Zack and I did a brief
experiment involving sea chimps.

24:47.433 --> 24:49.889
Sea chimps? I love sea chimps.

24:50.115 --> 24:53.072
To confirm that they would feed
on decomposing human tissue?

24:53.166 --> 24:55.654
Great, thanks for ruining the
whole sea chimp thing for me.

24:55.791 --> 24:57.746
- Did they?
- Those sea chimps went after that pork

24:57.747 --> 25:00.840
by product like piranhas after
a skinny-dipping missionary.

25:00.903 --> 25:03.985
Did you find anything in the fairy
shrimp beneath Chelsea Cole's body?

25:04.055 --> 25:05.119
Yeah.

25:06.195 --> 25:08.432
They were exposed to
lethal concentrations

25:08.433 --> 25:11.280
of non-nucleoside reverse
transcriptase inhibitors.

25:11.281 --> 25:13.587
- I feel bad for the sea chimps, but...
- Booth.

25:14.151 --> 25:18.078
Chelsea Cole was poisoned
by an overdose of Navirapine.

25:18.383 --> 25:19.400
What's that?

25:19.556 --> 25:21.981
- AIDS medicine.
- AIDS medicine...

25:22.083 --> 25:23.741
It was her mother.

25:26.694 --> 25:29.166
We'll probably be able
to trace this to you.

25:29.354 --> 25:31.936
- I loved my daughter very much.
- The hell you did.

25:31.937 --> 25:34.556
She got to be too much for you
to handle, so you killed her.

25:34.630 --> 25:35.929
You don't understand.

25:35.930 --> 25:38.307
I don't think you'll
ever find anyone who does.

25:38.553 --> 25:40.869
You know, your daughter had
the mind of a six year old.

25:41.025 --> 25:43.497
She loved the stars; she trusted you...

25:43.713 --> 25:44.886
We're here.

25:45.058 --> 25:46.529
and you killed her.

25:47.088 --> 25:48.715
Ritonavir...

25:49.134 --> 25:51.434
MK-0518...

25:52.196 --> 25:53.338
Tenofir.

25:54.332 --> 25:56.976
None of those is a trade
name for Navirapine.

25:57.117 --> 26:00.152
Wait... MK-0518...

26:00.242 --> 26:03.731
is still in experimental
trials to replace Navirapine.

26:03.958 --> 26:07.243
She used her old medicine to
poison Chelsea. Thanks, Cam.

26:07.302 --> 26:10.713
Cynthia Cole, you're under arrest for
the murder of your daughter, Chelsea Cole.

26:13.675 --> 26:16.914
Could you please take down
the pictures Chelsea drew?

26:17.008 --> 26:19.683
I don't want anyone to come
in and just throw them away.

26:21.913 --> 26:23.931
You threw away your own daughter.

26:24.064 --> 26:25.890
Why would I do you a favor?

26:25.891 --> 26:30.083
You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say
can and will be used against you in a court of law.

26:37.430 --> 26:39.667
In 1978, Max Keenan

26:39.668 --> 26:42.405
robbed a Piggly Wiggly
in Carbondale, Illinois.

26:42.479 --> 26:44.764
The clerk conked him on the
head with a baseball bat.

26:45.030 --> 26:47.799
Keenan pressed napkins to
his head to staunch the blood,

26:47.854 --> 26:49.621
left them behind.

26:52.011 --> 26:53.138
Don't tell me.

26:53.139 --> 26:57.331
State Police have said
napkins in evidence.

27:01.097 --> 27:04.727
Agent Booth, you wanted me to get
this information for you, correct?

27:05.032 --> 27:06.440
Good work, Charlie.

27:21.765 --> 27:22.766
Hey.

27:24.937 --> 27:25.985
I mean...

27:32.305 --> 27:34.214
You get that a lot, right? The whole...

27:34.742 --> 27:36.729
Rrr, rrr, rrr... thing.

27:36.822 --> 27:40.014
- Can I help you?
- I'm... Jack Hodgins.

27:44.899 --> 27:47.105
You seem okay to me so far.

27:47.481 --> 27:49.429
Well, I suddenly realized...

27:49.430 --> 27:52.636
My best man said,
speeches at the wedding...

27:53.755 --> 27:56.008
- You know about the wedding?
- Oh, yes.

27:56.009 --> 27:57.807
It's no coincidence I'm here.

27:58.022 --> 28:01.088
Well, it occurred to me that
you might have a traditional...

28:02.058 --> 28:03.979
You're Texan, and...

28:04.120 --> 28:05.935
I mean, really Texan.

28:05.936 --> 28:08.935
Guitars and hot rods Texan, so...

28:09.169 --> 28:11.672
So I figured I should ask you for
your daughter's hand in marriage.

28:13.448 --> 28:14.950
As a sign of respect.

28:15.060 --> 28:17.813
You're making a huge mistake, son.

28:18.056 --> 28:19.886
- Marrying Angela?
- No.

28:19.887 --> 28:23.172
If Angie finds out that a man, you,

28:23.637 --> 28:25.624
asked another man, me...

28:26.133 --> 28:30.138
me, for her hand, or any
of her other fine parts,

28:30.228 --> 28:32.653
horrible complications will ensue.

28:34.073 --> 28:37.155
- I didn't think of that.
- You could get us both killed.

28:37.945 --> 28:39.901
Okay. Good advice.

28:42.404 --> 28:43.624
You got any more?

28:44.571 --> 28:47.403
Always play it in the
key of G demolished.

28:48.302 --> 28:50.868
I don't know what that means.

28:50.978 --> 28:54.341
Well, if you do, you do.
If you don't, you don't.

28:54.396 --> 28:55.491
Forget it.

29:06.654 --> 29:07.906
Hodgins.

29:10.542 --> 29:14.454
I've got cars and I've got guitars...

29:15.811 --> 29:17.532
and I got guns.

29:19.219 --> 29:21.331
You treat my little girl right,

29:21.581 --> 29:25.571
you'll only see the business
end of the cars and guitars.

30:21.018 --> 30:23.161
Am I going to need to use my gun, Max?

30:24.444 --> 30:25.758
You got your piece of paper?

30:25.759 --> 30:27.487
Max Keenan, I'm placing you under arrest

30:27.488 --> 30:29.818
- for the murder of Deputy Director...
- Oh, fine, fine. Sure.

30:30.565 --> 30:34.586
You know what? You can take me. You're
right. I'm not going to abandon her again.

30:35.736 --> 30:38.458
- You're not going to resist?
- It's your lucky day, I guess.

30:38.630 --> 30:40.398
- Great.
- No.

30:40.399 --> 30:42.589
No. Wait a minute. No.

30:43.054 --> 30:46.653
See, I'm wrong. I can't just
go quietly. It's not my nature.

30:46.758 --> 30:48.291
Max, I got a gun.

30:48.292 --> 30:50.466
I can't surrender. You're
going to have to shoot me.

30:50.932 --> 30:52.449
You... You understand.

30:52.488 --> 30:53.787
Not your nature?

30:53.849 --> 30:55.899
Yeah, maybe it's a character flaw.

30:56.646 --> 30:59.978
Yeah, shoot me. Shoot me. But in
the leg, please, if you don't mind.

31:02.095 --> 31:03.628
Ok. Hold up.

31:03.800 --> 31:05.255
One second, please. Thank you.

31:08.165 --> 31:09.260
Ready?

31:13.461 --> 31:16.074
Hey. Hey, that's good,
kid. You're throwing.

31:16.958 --> 31:19.070
What's the matter? Got a glass jaw?

31:19.071 --> 31:20.728
You know what? You talk too much.

31:21.198 --> 31:24.092
Right in the face? Geez. Time. Time.

31:24.600 --> 31:26.932
- You had enough?
- Wait.

31:27.303 --> 31:30.636
-  I'm old. - There's no
time-outs during an arrest.

31:38.599 --> 31:42.041
Ok, I'm done. I'm done.
It's over. I'm finished.

31:43.242 --> 31:44.368
Let's go.

31:46.962 --> 31:48.964
Oh, God. That really hurts.

32:11.047 --> 32:14.176
<i>Hi, Temperance. It's Mom.</i>

32:14.317 --> 32:17.383
<i>I don't know when or
if you'll ever see this.</i>

32:17.813 --> 32:20.160
<i>I hope to put it in your hands myself,</i>

32:21.013 --> 32:23.360
<i>see you again with my own eyes,</i>

32:24.690 --> 32:27.725
<i>but this is a hard, hard world.</i>

32:29.598 --> 32:31.742
<i>Your father and I left you and Russ</i>

32:32.004 --> 32:33.521
<i>to save your lives.</i>

32:34.957 --> 32:37.491
<i>People would have killed you to get us.</i>

32:38.113 --> 32:40.038
<i>But that's not what this is about.</i>

32:41.817 --> 32:44.477
<i>Today is your 16th birthday.</i>

32:47.328 --> 32:50.285
<i>I'm so sorry... not to be there to</i>

32:50.880 --> 32:55.010
<i>to tell you all the things that a mother
should tell her daughter when she turns 16.</i>

32:56.407 --> 32:59.817
<i>And sorry not to give you this...</i>

33:01.003 --> 33:04.038
<i>It's an heirloom from
my side of the family</i>

33:04.984 --> 33:07.237
<i>and starting today, it's yours.</i>

33:08.360 --> 33:11.082
<i>I don't know how long it will
take me to get it to you, but</i>

33:11.207 --> 33:12.960
<i>I promise you I will.</i>

33:14.019 --> 33:16.570
<i>You're going to hear a lot
of things about your parents,</i>

33:17.301 --> 33:19.085
<i>especially about your father.</i>

33:19.601 --> 33:21.291
<i>He is a good man.</i>

33:22.534 --> 33:25.382
<i>It was my insistence to leave you kids.</i>

33:25.847 --> 33:27.834
<i>Max would have kept us together,</i>

33:28.550 --> 33:30.177
<i>fought until the end.</i>

33:30.404 --> 33:32.626
<i>I'm not sure he'll ever
forgive me for that.</i>

33:32.939 --> 33:34.441
<i>So, please, Temperance...</i>

33:36.330 --> 33:38.270
<i>I need you to forgive me.</i>

33:40.503 --> 33:44.399
<i>And if you can't forgive
me, I beg you, honey,</i>

33:46.018 --> 33:47.786
<i>forgive your father</i>

33:49.030 --> 33:50.986
<i>because he is a very good man.</i>

33:51.705 --> 33:53.082
<i>Remember this:</i>

33:53.176 --> 33:56.086
<i>you were cherished in this world.</i>

33:57.545 --> 33:59.156
<i>Adored.</i>

34:00.701 --> 34:03.314
<i>What I did to you may have been wrong,</i>

34:04.237 --> 34:06.240
<i>but I did it out of love.</i>

34:07.843 --> 34:09.956
<i>I did it out of love.</i>

34:29.364 --> 34:31.304
Chelsea thought that

34:31.862 --> 34:34.492
stars were signals from heaven,

34:35.007 --> 34:37.120
showing how to get home.

34:38.677 --> 34:40.929
Your AIDS cocktail wasn't working.

34:41.422 --> 34:43.050
You were sick...

34:43.940 --> 34:45.536
dying.

34:47.317 --> 34:50.226
They put you on an experimental drug

34:51.239 --> 34:53.587
and you felt even worse.

34:54.252 --> 34:56.708
Your worst nightmare was coming true:

34:56.896 --> 34:58.836
Chelsea was going to outlive you.

35:03.522 --> 35:06.150
No foster parent would take her.

35:08.035 --> 35:10.288
You did what you did...

35:12.267 --> 35:14.020
out of mercy.

35:17.454 --> 35:20.505
We went to the park.

35:21.397 --> 35:23.133
And I gave, uh...

35:26.035 --> 35:28.273
told Chelsea that it was candy.

35:29.657 --> 35:30.768
We...

35:32.376 --> 35:34.895
we sat there looking up at the stars.

35:36.205 --> 35:38.176
I didn't know what to do with her.

35:39.037 --> 35:41.180
I didn't have any strength left.

35:43.488 --> 35:45.412
And then...

35:46.879 --> 35:48.944
I remembered the water.

35:49.906 --> 35:52.456
And I thought it was deep.

35:53.223 --> 35:55.054
Peaceful, you know?

35:55.910 --> 35:57.318
And then...

35:59.391 --> 36:01.566
like you were being punished,

36:03.052 --> 36:05.055
the experimental drug

36:06.209 --> 36:08.743
started to work, didn't it?

36:12.803 --> 36:14.118
You got better.

36:18.397 --> 36:20.430
What you did was wrong...

36:24.584 --> 36:26.258
but you did it out of love.

37:03.005 --> 37:04.507
How do I look?

37:07.351 --> 37:08.509
Good.

37:09.314 --> 37:11.520
How come yours looks so much better?

37:11.583 --> 37:15.291
I took this and yanked.

37:15.788 --> 37:17.649
Have you been to Iraq?

37:18.001 --> 37:20.880
That's classified information,
and you aren't cleared for that.

37:20.881 --> 37:22.617
Does it hurt to get shot?

37:22.785 --> 37:23.786
What?

37:23.818 --> 37:26.540
I've been blown up. That
wasn't as bad as I expected.

37:26.541 --> 37:28.065
But I've never been shot.

37:29.020 --> 37:30.882
- Booth?
- Yeah.

37:31.895 --> 37:32.974
Better?

37:33.795 --> 37:36.033
Wow. You look great.

37:36.158 --> 37:38.161
You said I looked good before.

37:39.240 --> 37:41.704
Whose day is it, huh? It's
Angela's. Come on, let's go.

37:41.970 --> 37:43.065
There you go.

37:49.243 --> 37:51.313
- Bones?
- Yes?

37:51.727 --> 37:53.589
Listen, I'm

37:54.434 --> 37:57.594
I'm sorry, I had to arrest your father.

37:57.595 --> 38:01.701
We don't have to talk about that right
now. You did your duty. I understand.

38:02.151 --> 38:03.966
Yep. But...

38:33.492 --> 38:35.417
- Bones?
- What?

38:35.698 --> 38:37.623
- He could have gotten away.
- What?

38:38.417 --> 38:41.499
We got into a fight. Your dad
could have escaped capture.

38:41.632 --> 38:43.556
- So he beat you in the fight?
- No, I didn't say that.

38:43.557 --> 38:45.747
You beat him, but you gave
him a chance to get away?

38:45.748 --> 38:47.843
No, I didn't say that. I don't
see any other alternative.

38:47.844 --> 38:50.472
No, Bones, your father chose to
be arrested because he felt if

38:50.473 --> 38:52.889
he abandoned you again,
he'd lose you forever.

38:55.400 --> 38:57.293
I just thought you should know.

39:01.779 --> 39:03.297
Thanks, Booth.

39:04.916 --> 39:06.183
Hi.

39:07.740 --> 39:10.337
I'd like to get married now.

39:18.383 --> 39:20.073
Welcome, everyone.

39:20.495 --> 39:24.653
We have gathered here today
to join together in matrimony

39:24.700 --> 39:29.628
Jack Stanley Hodgins and
Angela Pearly Gates Montenegro.

39:30.333 --> 39:32.038
Who gives this woman?

39:32.226 --> 39:34.510
I give you this beautiful woman.

39:41.148 --> 39:42.759
I got a show.

39:45.239 --> 39:47.993
Have a good time, everybody.

39:49.115 --> 39:53.074
Angela and Jack have
invited us all here today

39:53.254 --> 39:55.522
to be part of something beautiful.

39:55.585 --> 39:59.027
Two people standing
before their friends,

39:59.160 --> 40:02.070
family, and community to say,

40:02.179 --> 40:04.448
"You are the one I love."

40:04.510 --> 40:07.186
"You are the one for whom
I forsake all others."

40:07.256 --> 40:08.617
Excuse me?

40:09.051 --> 40:11.821
Is this the
Hodgins-Montenegro nuptials?

40:11.989 --> 40:13.381
It's trying to be.

40:13.569 --> 40:17.105
I'm with the State Department and it's imperative
that I speak with Hodgins and Montenegro

40:17.106 --> 40:20.418
before these proceedings... proceed.

40:24.161 --> 40:26.523
Come on then. Let's
get this figured out.

40:29.523 --> 40:31.855
We'll, um... be right back.

40:38.754 --> 40:40.726
- Booth?
- Yeah.

40:41.367 --> 40:44.081
Is there any sense in ducking
when someone shoots at you?

40:44.191 --> 40:46.788
Your body ducks whether
you want to or not.

40:51.243 --> 40:53.324
- Why?
- You can read this later,

40:53.414 --> 40:55.495
then explain it to everyone.

40:59.211 --> 41:00.290
Why me?

41:00.396 --> 41:03.759
You know more about duty and
honor than anyone else I know.

41:05.504 --> 41:07.303
Angela is already married?

41:07.304 --> 41:10.933
Angela is totally,
unmistakably, legally married.

41:10.934 --> 41:13.104
As federal employees
with security clearance,

41:13.105 --> 41:15.161
your marriage license
underwent special scrutiny,

41:15.162 --> 41:16.882
especially since your
wedding was so hurried.

41:16.883 --> 41:19.385
You were married in Fiji four years ago.

41:19.448 --> 41:21.669
I jumped over a broomstick with a guy.

41:22.041 --> 41:23.277
I'm sorry.

41:28.303 --> 41:29.899
Jack, I...

41:30.415 --> 41:31.870
I'm sorry.

41:31.956 --> 41:34.585
- This is my fault.
- No worries...

41:35.774 --> 41:38.199
No worries. We'll just...

41:38.273 --> 41:39.853
We'll, um...

41:41.598 --> 41:44.445
There's just a lot of people
in there expecting a wedding.

41:44.446 --> 41:45.885
Yeah,

41:46.440 --> 41:49.522
I made this huge deal out of
getting married right away and

41:49.726 --> 41:52.370
and they all... and... Run.

41:53.504 --> 41:57.321
What? Flee. Scram. Skedaddle.

42:00.161 --> 42:01.616
I like it.

42:04.882 --> 42:08.074
Change of plan. Please go to the
reception. Have a great time on us.

42:08.117 --> 42:09.587
Thank you for coming.

42:29.257 --> 42:31.718
What do we do now?
