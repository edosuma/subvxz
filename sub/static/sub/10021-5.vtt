WEBVTT

00:04.455 --> 00:06.893
ER

00:07.064 --> 00:08.188
Previously on ER:

00:08.399 --> 00:10.060
That was a great save.

00:10.267 --> 00:13.361
Actually, I meant
being your full-time P.A.

00:13.571 --> 00:15.266
Great. I'd love that.

00:15.472 --> 00:17.997
This is more of a formality
than anything else.

00:18.209 --> 00:19.972
For you, but you're
my only intern.

00:20.177 --> 00:23.772
I admire your fortitude, taking
orders from a weasel like Dale.

00:23.981 --> 00:26.745
Your presentation was everything
we expected.

00:26.951 --> 00:29.112
This is ridiculous.
Everyone thinks you can.

00:29.320 --> 00:30.582
I'll talk to Dr. Carter.

00:30.788 --> 00:33.416
I can't start an IV.
I don't know how, never have.

00:33.624 --> 00:36.957
If you ever lie to me again,
look for another rotation.

00:37.982 --> 00:40.773
"Masquerade"

00:44.278 --> 00:45.653
Watch yourself.

00:45.863 --> 00:47.322
Sorry.

00:51.285 --> 00:54.240
She's in active labor.
Water broke in the rig.

00:54.414 --> 00:55.789
Got to play catch.

00:55.999 --> 00:58.668
Jerry, scarfing a little
early dinner back there?

00:58.835 --> 01:02.584
What? Oh, no.
Good one, Chuny.

01:06.719 --> 01:08.213
- Baby, baby!
- Our mother-to-be?

01:08.429 --> 01:11.383
Good guess. First name's Coco.
No last name or address.

01:11.599 --> 01:14.007
- Collapsed in a crosswalk.
- Don't walk, don't talk.

01:14.185 --> 01:15.513
Vitals are stable.

01:15.728 --> 01:17.804
I can feel the head!
Mr. Potato Head!

01:17.981 --> 01:20.057
We took a peek, she's not crowning.

01:20.275 --> 01:22.848
Crown me. I'm the queen.
The prince is coming.

01:23.069 --> 01:26.937
- What's your due date, Coco?
- I don't like dates. Too sweet.

01:27.157 --> 01:28.651
Big one! Big pain!

01:29.952 --> 01:31.280
Ever delivered a baby?

01:31.495 --> 01:33.784
- No delivery.
- Let's go to Curtain Area 3.

01:33.998 --> 01:36.915
B.O.A. kit, fetal monitor
and baby warmer.

01:37.126 --> 01:39.166
- Hey, Jerry? Page OB for me.
- You got it.

01:39.378 --> 01:41.205
Dude, the eagle has landed.

01:41.380 --> 01:44.584
Oh, Lydia. I guess you didn't
get my memo.

01:44.801 --> 01:48.087
The p. m. shift is not wearing
costumes this year.

01:48.305 --> 01:50.048
It scares the patients.

01:50.223 --> 01:54.221
A lot of things have been said about this
set of gams, but scary isn't one of them.

01:54.394 --> 01:57.680
It isn't very professional,
so if you wouldn't mind changing...

01:57.898 --> 02:01.398
I actually got some of these
little jack-o'- lantern pins...

02:01.569 --> 02:03.360
...if you want to
signify the holiday.

02:03.529 --> 02:04.858
Fun.

02:05.698 --> 02:08.735
I'm glad my "no costume" memo
made it to some people.

02:08.910 --> 02:11.864
This is my costume.
I'm dressed as a total stiff.

02:12.080 --> 02:16.030
Oh, well, I guess I can make
an exception.

02:16.251 --> 02:18.789
Four-year-old child with
puncture wounds to the neck.

02:19.004 --> 02:21.329
- He's not in Trauma?
- You wanted the children-

02:21.548 --> 02:23.256
Get me an intubation tray now.

02:23.425 --> 02:26.711
And I want four units of your blood.

02:29.974 --> 02:32.382
What? Come on, this is funny.

02:34.000 --> 02:40.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:22.864 --> 03:25.319
You, of all people,
should be able to joke.

03:25.491 --> 03:27.151
I didn't think it was appropriate.

03:27.327 --> 03:30.162
But putting surgilube on every
phone in the ER, that's okay?

03:30.330 --> 03:33.497
I'm not in charge of the whole ER,
I'm in charge of the Pedes ER.

03:33.708 --> 03:36.413
The joke was on you, Doug,
not on the Pedes ER.

03:36.628 --> 03:38.621
But that seems to be
one and the same.

03:38.839 --> 03:40.464
What's that supposed to mean?

03:40.674 --> 03:43.000
- The memo in my box this morning.
- Yeah?

03:43.219 --> 03:45.046
I thought it was your
Halloween prank.

03:45.262 --> 03:47.136
What's wrong with this? What?

03:47.348 --> 03:50.219
Doug. "All pediatric patients
must be seen by Dr. Ross...

03:50.435 --> 03:51.763
...prior to discharge.

03:51.936 --> 03:55.056
Dr. Ross will conduct a daily review
on all pediatric patients. "

03:55.273 --> 03:56.767
What's wrong with that?

03:56.983 --> 03:59.225
It means you sign off on
Kerry Weaver's charts?

03:59.444 --> 04:01.982
- Yeah, and Mark.
- Yeah. So you're psyched.

04:02.155 --> 04:03.531
It's time for a change.

04:03.699 --> 04:06.237
Kind of like me.
I woke and was a Transylvanian bat.

04:06.410 --> 04:07.738
All right. Enough. Okay?

04:07.912 --> 04:10.782
- Good luck.
- Carol, could you come in here?

04:13.376 --> 04:14.704
What's up?

04:14.919 --> 04:17.208
Coco here claims to be
nine months pregnant.

04:17.380 --> 04:19.668
Try for fetal heart tones.
I couldn't find them.

04:19.841 --> 04:21.668
Find them. Don't lose them.

04:21.885 --> 04:23.628
Look in the Lost and Found.

04:25.180 --> 04:27.932
Cervix isn't dilated.
No adnexal masses.

04:28.684 --> 04:32.183
- She sure looks pregnant.
- I'm having a baby.

04:32.396 --> 04:36.346
I appreciate a normal uterus and two
liters of urine in her bladder.

04:36.567 --> 04:38.311
Coco, we'll give you a bedpan.

04:38.528 --> 04:41.279
Can you try and relax
and relieve yourself?

04:41.447 --> 04:43.689
Shallow breath.

04:43.908 --> 04:45.533
Nature's way.

04:46.411 --> 04:47.739
- Want Foley?
- Yeah.

04:47.954 --> 04:51.573
And a urine tox screen.
Call Psych while you're at it.

04:51.792 --> 04:53.619
I can't believe you're wearing that.

04:53.835 --> 04:56.872
It has got itchy.
But it's my first Halloween in the States.

04:57.047 --> 04:58.423
You were here last year.

04:58.632 --> 05:01.503
Yeah, but I was stuck in the O.R.
So no trick-or-treating...

05:01.719 --> 05:03.842
- ... apple-bobbing, hayrides.
- Hayrides?

05:04.013 --> 05:05.840
Isn't that how you celebrate
Halloween?

05:06.015 --> 05:09.847
Riding in a cart full of hay with
your sweetie, under the stars?

05:10.019 --> 05:12.427
Elizabeth, there are no hay carts
in Chicago.

05:12.605 --> 05:15.393
You know what I mean.
Celebrating the night.

05:15.567 --> 05:16.895
Celebrating what?

05:17.069 --> 05:19.357
Kids rotting their teeth,
getting stomachaches.

05:19.571 --> 05:21.279
People wearing stupid-

05:21.490 --> 05:24.325
I have a thing against costumes,
you know?

05:24.910 --> 05:27.532
There must have been someone
you wanted to be.

05:27.705 --> 05:29.579
I'm a doctor.
That's who I wanted to be.

05:29.749 --> 05:32.038
Yes, but as a child.

05:32.251 --> 05:36.415
You must have wanted to be a spaceman
or a footballer?

05:36.589 --> 05:37.918
Nope.

05:38.091 --> 05:41.009
You really are extraordinary, Peter.

05:43.597 --> 05:45.388
How about a knight in shining armor?

05:45.599 --> 05:46.974
- No.
- A cowboy?

05:47.184 --> 05:49.177
No. Listen, let's go to Dempsey's.

05:49.395 --> 05:52.312
They've got great food,
and what is that? Swing dancing.

05:52.523 --> 05:53.851
Elizabeth, there you are.

05:54.066 --> 05:57.685
My sigmoid volvulus is red-lined
and the labs aren't on the chart.

05:57.862 --> 06:00.614
I checked the computer.
All is back but the electrolytes.

06:00.823 --> 06:04.489
Checking isn't good enough. The lab
said the specimen was hemolyzed.

06:04.703 --> 06:06.031
I'll call Phlebotomy.

06:06.246 --> 06:10.196
Takes too long. Redraw yourself
and hand-carry it to the lab.

06:10.417 --> 06:12.125
Yes, sir.

06:19.302 --> 06:21.128
- Excuse me.
- You'll have to wait.

06:21.888 --> 06:23.761
- Yeah?
- I'm looking for Dr. Greene.

06:23.973 --> 06:26.974
Oh, damn! I needed to save that.

06:27.435 --> 06:29.060
So I can find Dr. Greene, where?

06:29.270 --> 06:31.228
You're gonna have to wait in Chairs.

06:31.439 --> 06:33.183
Okey-doke.

06:33.775 --> 06:36.646
Jerry, has the systems guy
taken a look at this yet?

06:36.820 --> 06:40.486
He looked, but he didn't touch.
The work order wasn't cosigned.

06:40.824 --> 06:42.651
Lily, what do you got there?

06:42.827 --> 06:44.654
This was sitting in the ambulance bay.

06:44.870 --> 06:47.622
Look. There's all kinds
of stuff in this bag too.

06:47.832 --> 06:49.789
Four-by-fours, Steri-Strips,
IV tubing.

06:50.001 --> 06:51.329
I'll take care of this.

06:51.502 --> 06:53.163
- Really? You sure?
- No worries.

06:53.379 --> 06:55.372
- Thanks.
- Sure.

06:56.591 --> 06:58.169
- Hey, Jerry.
- Hi.

06:58.343 --> 06:59.672
You can't blow it off?

06:59.845 --> 07:02.715
Don't get me wrong. I would love
to attend your shindig...

07:02.931 --> 07:05.173
...but this is a Teamster party.

07:05.392 --> 07:08.062
Your eyes are aglow with
disability policies.

07:08.270 --> 07:11.604
It's rare that a policy
underwriter has an opportunity...

07:11.816 --> 07:14.141
...with a roomful of drunken
manual laborers.

07:14.360 --> 07:16.732
Sounds better than chaperoning
a dorm party.

07:16.946 --> 07:20.362
Everybody knows the best part of
a bad party is sneaking out.

07:20.575 --> 07:22.034
Preferably not alone.

07:22.244 --> 07:23.952
So I might see you later?

07:24.162 --> 07:26.369
Or I'll make it up to you.

07:27.207 --> 07:30.541
Dr. Carter, hi. I got the elbow
films back on Mr. -

07:30.711 --> 07:33.249
Lucy, can you give us
a second, please?

07:33.464 --> 07:35.006
Sure.

07:36.258 --> 07:37.587
What did you say?

07:37.802 --> 07:40.719
I got the elbow films back
on Mr. Cahan...

07:40.930 --> 07:43.931
...and the CBC and chem panel
on Ms. Nicolara.

07:44.726 --> 07:46.054
Thanks. Looks good.

07:46.269 --> 07:47.626
I was thinking about you at diner
and realized...

07:47.604 --> 07:48.884
that I left this in my car.

07:49.064 --> 07:50.392
Is that for the party?

07:50.607 --> 07:53.098
No. I think you should
start practicing your IVs.

07:53.277 --> 07:54.605
I have been practicing.

07:54.820 --> 07:56.362
Then this should be old hat.

07:56.572 --> 07:58.980
Dr. Carter, good.
These suckers are heavy.

07:59.200 --> 08:01.488
- What are these?
- Tomorrow's conference:

08:01.702 --> 08:05.534
"The Acute Abdomen in the Elderly. "
I pulled an ischemic bowel...

08:05.748 --> 08:08.915
...you had a few months ago.
I was hoping you'd present.

08:09.085 --> 08:10.414
Never done that.

08:10.587 --> 08:13.790
It's great experience if you're
serious about being Chief Resident.

08:13.965 --> 08:16.919
- Oh, I'm serious.
- I look forward to your presentation.

08:17.094 --> 08:20.545
- Chief Resident. Pretty cool.
- Yeah, pretty cool.

08:20.764 --> 08:22.508
- Incoming.
- I got it!

08:22.725 --> 08:24.599
- What do we got?
- Joe Chattarowski, 40.

08:24.810 --> 08:28.226
Drank a quart of vodka. Called
911 when he was too drunk to walk.

08:28.439 --> 08:30.183
- I need help, doc.
- Exam 2.

08:31.109 --> 08:32.936
Drink every day, Mr. Chattarowski?

08:33.152 --> 08:35.691
Yeah. But I want to quit.

08:35.905 --> 08:37.234
Are you serious?

08:37.407 --> 08:38.735
I'm dead serious.

08:38.950 --> 08:42.734
- Not just looking for a place to sleep?
- On my mother's eyes.

08:43.664 --> 08:46.499
Can you admit me for detox, please?

08:47.084 --> 08:49.456
I think Miss Knight can help
you out with that.

08:49.670 --> 08:53.205
See if you can find him a detox bed.
Then practice on that arm.

08:53.424 --> 08:56.342
Let's transfer him. Ready?
One, two, three.

08:58.096 --> 09:00.503
Average daily census is 150.

09:00.682 --> 09:02.390
We see 275 a day at Bellevue.

09:02.559 --> 09:03.887
Impressive.

09:04.102 --> 09:07.269
We're the second largest emergency
department in the world.

09:07.439 --> 09:09.396
I'll show you the trauma rooms.

09:10.484 --> 09:11.895
Hey, Jerry?

09:12.111 --> 09:13.819
- Who's that?
- With Dr. Greene?

09:13.988 --> 09:16.905
That is Dr. Litvak from New York.

09:17.074 --> 09:18.403
Dan Litvak?

09:18.617 --> 09:20.859
Yeah. He's here
interviewing to be ER Chief.

09:21.078 --> 09:22.952
Oh, my God! Dan Litvak.

09:23.164 --> 09:27.625
He's national chair of the ACEP Panel
for Practice Guidelines.

09:27.836 --> 09:30.753
Lead article in last month's annals.

09:30.964 --> 09:32.755
That's good, right?

09:36.261 --> 09:37.637
Hey, buddy. I'm Dr. Ross.

09:37.846 --> 09:39.424
- What's your name?
- Jared.

09:39.640 --> 09:43.389
Pruritic rash from his makeup.
He's covered with hives.

09:43.686 --> 09:46.058
- Let's see. Has he had hives before?
- No.

09:46.272 --> 09:51.183
All right, any swelling in your mouth?
Are you having trouble breathing?

09:51.402 --> 09:53.110
- My tongue feels big.
- Okay.

09:53.321 --> 09:55.278
BP's 90/60. Pulse 72.

09:55.490 --> 10:00.069
Let's give him. 2 of sub-q epi,
Benadryl 25 IV.

10:00.245 --> 10:03.199
- Is he going to be okay?
- He has a bad allergic reaction.

10:03.373 --> 10:06.992
We'll treat him with IV medication,
and watch him for a few hours.

10:07.211 --> 10:08.789
Can I still go trick-or-treating?

10:08.963 --> 10:12.083
I don't think so, sweetie.
We'll find some fun stuff to do.

10:12.300 --> 10:15.336
Fun stuff around here sucks.

10:16.137 --> 10:18.260
What did you do with my baby?

10:18.473 --> 10:20.133
What did you-?
Where is my baby?

10:20.308 --> 10:21.637
Should I ask?

10:21.810 --> 10:24.135
Twenty-two-hundred cc's out so far.
Belly's flat.

10:24.312 --> 10:26.471
I lost my baby.

10:26.690 --> 10:29.228
Haldol, five milligrams I.M.

10:30.361 --> 10:35.070
Mark, I'm looking for your charts
on last month's unscheduled returns.

10:35.282 --> 10:37.026
Yeah. I put them in your box.

10:37.243 --> 10:41.241
Kerry, this is Dr. Dan Litvak. This
is Dr. Kerry Weaver, Interim Chief.

10:41.414 --> 10:42.956
Nice to meet you.

10:43.917 --> 10:47.250
- Where are you from, Dr. Litvak?
- New York. Bellevue.

10:48.255 --> 10:49.797
Just here to get a few tips?

10:50.007 --> 10:53.257
No, I just had my second interview
for the Chief position.

10:53.469 --> 10:56.339
Dr. Greene is being kind enough
to show me around.

10:56.597 --> 10:58.340
Second interview?

10:58.557 --> 11:02.887
They want to meet with Dr. Litvak
one more time before tonight's vote.

11:03.062 --> 11:05.269
I thought the vote wasn't
until next Wednesday.

11:05.440 --> 11:07.349
I have to hop a plane tonight.

11:07.525 --> 11:10.610
They thought it would be best
for me to know beforehand.

11:10.779 --> 11:12.439
That's great.
The sooner the better.

11:12.656 --> 11:15.111
I guess I'll just check my mailbox.

11:18.453 --> 11:20.612
That's the competition, huh?

11:21.457 --> 11:22.785
Did you get that detox bed?

11:22.958 --> 11:24.536
No one called me back yet.

11:24.752 --> 11:26.543
Got a flash...

11:26.754 --> 11:29.292
...and I am in.

11:29.465 --> 11:30.794
Yes, you are.

11:30.967 --> 11:32.342
I'm ready for the real thing.

11:32.552 --> 11:35.173
Let's find out. I'll talk you
through Mr. Chattarowski.

11:35.346 --> 11:36.675
Okay.

11:36.848 --> 11:38.971
Make sure we don't repeat our
last IV fiasco.

11:39.142 --> 11:40.601
Definitely won't happen again.

11:40.811 --> 11:44.144
- No, it was my fault as much as yours.
- I wouldn't say that.

11:44.356 --> 11:49.314
I should've supervised you
and not let you get to that place.

11:49.653 --> 11:52.820
From now on, we'll just take it
one step at a time.

11:53.032 --> 11:54.407
Carter, your drunk eloped.

11:54.575 --> 11:56.402
- Chattarowski?
- Does that mean he left?

11:56.619 --> 11:59.704
- Yep.
- Does anyone else need an IV?

12:00.707 --> 12:02.035
I've got it.

12:02.208 --> 12:05.874
You wanted to be a superhero.
Tights, cape.

12:06.046 --> 12:07.374
Yeah, wrong.

12:07.547 --> 12:11.047
There was someone, wasn't there?
Hey, look who's here.

12:11.260 --> 12:13.134
Bye-bye, cutie-pie.

12:13.304 --> 12:16.340
Hey, little bee.
Gosh, he's getting so big.

12:16.557 --> 12:18.597
I know. Eating me out
of house and home.

12:18.768 --> 12:21.223
- I didn't expect you.
- Just left Walt and Jackie's.

12:21.437 --> 12:22.766
The annual blowout?

12:22.939 --> 12:25.395
I told Walt he should
just put on one of his...

12:25.608 --> 12:28.182
...super-duper fly outfits
he wore in the '70s.

12:28.361 --> 12:31.362
That brother still thinks polyester's
gonna make a comeback.

12:31.573 --> 12:34.527
Speaking of costumes,
do you have any film left?

12:34.701 --> 12:37.738
Yes. We should have one
with his daddy.

12:37.955 --> 12:39.414
- Absolutely.
- Would you do it?

12:39.623 --> 12:41.118
Sure.

12:41.333 --> 12:43.907
Okay, ready?

12:45.713 --> 12:47.291
Feeling any better?

12:49.467 --> 12:51.674
All right, I guess.

12:53.221 --> 12:56.008
What did you...?
What did you give me?

12:57.809 --> 13:00.680
Haldol, to calm you down.

13:01.730 --> 13:03.557
I can't take that.

13:04.066 --> 13:05.893
It's not good for my baby.

13:06.485 --> 13:08.027
Coco, you don't have a baby.

13:09.030 --> 13:10.987
But I will, really.

13:11.824 --> 13:13.734
I'm in my first trimester.

13:14.285 --> 13:18.235
Coco, you're not pregnant.
You were just retaining urine.

13:18.456 --> 13:20.116
Carol.

13:21.042 --> 13:22.952
You did a pregnancy test,
didn't you?

13:23.170 --> 13:25.044
I'm starting to wish I had.

13:26.673 --> 13:28.915
I'm schizophrenic...

13:29.760 --> 13:32.880
...and I had been taking respiradone.

13:33.097 --> 13:36.632
But when I found out I was pregnant,
I went off the medication...

13:36.851 --> 13:38.808
...so that the baby would be okay.

13:42.816 --> 13:45.817
What will the Haldol do to the baby?

13:47.279 --> 13:49.770
If in fact you are pregnant...

13:49.948 --> 13:53.068
...there are reports
of limb malformation.

13:55.746 --> 13:57.953
Oh, my God!

14:00.835 --> 14:04.121
I'm so sorry, baby.

14:12.472 --> 14:14.963
Aorta's clamped, pericardium's dry.

14:15.142 --> 14:18.475
It looks like the heart is still
empty. Get two more units.

14:18.645 --> 14:20.638
Chest tube's gushing.
It's over two liters.

14:20.856 --> 14:22.185
Could be a hilar injury.

14:22.399 --> 14:24.725
Let's set up for a right-sided
thoracotomy. Move!

14:24.902 --> 14:26.444
Ten blade. We'll do a clamshell.

14:26.654 --> 14:30.153
Call the blood bank for O-neg,
and type-specific.

14:30.324 --> 14:33.444
Rib-spreader.
Peter, cut across the sternum.

14:33.661 --> 14:35.321
- I need a Lebsche knife.
- A what?

14:35.497 --> 14:36.872
A Lebsche and a mallet. Move!

14:37.082 --> 14:39.324
Look. Top drawer by the sink.

14:40.836 --> 14:43.327
What you really need is a sternal saw.

14:43.547 --> 14:46.881
A sternal saw is a tool for the O.R.,
not the ER. You know that.

14:47.092 --> 14:50.047
Chest is full of blood.
Vascular clamp, more suction.

14:50.262 --> 14:52.220
All right.
Can you locate the source?

14:52.431 --> 14:54.305
- Move your hand.
- Four units in.

14:55.351 --> 14:58.970
Okay, come on, Peter. He's losing it
faster than we can put it in.

14:59.189 --> 15:00.517
- Damn!
- Type-specific's here.

15:00.690 --> 15:02.517
- Hang it on rapid infuser.
- Almost there.

15:06.863 --> 15:08.192
Looks like right atrium.

15:08.365 --> 15:09.859
Vicryl now! Move!

15:10.033 --> 15:11.742
There were faster ways to do that.

15:20.211 --> 15:21.539
I am pregnant.

15:22.255 --> 15:23.998
The test confirmed it.

15:25.133 --> 15:27.589
We don't know if the Haldol
affected the fetus.

15:27.761 --> 15:29.837
We'll monitor the pregnancy
with ultrasound.

15:30.597 --> 15:32.471
Maybe I shouldn't have a baby.

15:33.767 --> 15:35.142
Because of the Haldol?

15:36.895 --> 15:39.813
I didn't even tell my mom, you know?
It was like...

15:39.982 --> 15:42.520
...she was so proud that I was
in a halfway house.

15:42.735 --> 15:45.024
I thought it would be okay.

15:45.238 --> 15:50.196
I thought I could go off my meds,
but I can't, can I?

15:53.413 --> 15:58.241
You'll probably have more incidents
like this one.

15:59.378 --> 16:01.667
I shouldn't go through with this.

16:04.049 --> 16:07.335
You've been through a lot
in a short amount of time.

16:07.511 --> 16:08.970
Maybe you should just wait.

16:11.307 --> 16:13.632
I shouldn't do this.

16:13.851 --> 16:15.310
I shouldn't do this.

16:18.398 --> 16:20.521
Think she'll terminate her pregnancy?

16:20.734 --> 16:22.358
That's the impression I got.

16:22.527 --> 16:24.853
Probably be the best for her,
and for you.

16:25.030 --> 16:27.735
Yeah, it gets me off the hook.

16:27.950 --> 16:30.192
Do you want to have a drink later?
Decompress?

16:30.411 --> 16:34.623
I would, but Jen's back in town, and
we have to have one of our "talks. "

16:34.832 --> 16:36.410
It's not your day, Mark.

16:36.626 --> 16:39.378
You can go now, Lucy.
We're caught up around here.

16:39.545 --> 16:42.001
What about the Pedes ER?
It's standing room only.

16:42.215 --> 16:44.421
Doug Ross is in the groove, huh?

16:44.634 --> 16:47.208
No, you'd probably
just slow him down.

16:47.429 --> 16:50.383
Great. It gives me more
time to prepare for the party.

16:52.851 --> 16:55.140
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to
upset the officer.

16:55.312 --> 16:58.397
Found him right back with a bottle
of Night Train at Lucky's.

16:58.566 --> 17:00.357
You need a revolving door here.

17:00.568 --> 17:04.518
Well, well, well. Long time no see,
Mr. Chattarowski.

17:04.696 --> 17:06.073
So you know this guy?

17:06.281 --> 17:09.236
Yeah, had him in earlier.
Came in to get detoxed...

17:09.411 --> 17:12.910
- ... then left before we were finished.
- Next time I'll call the cops.

17:13.080 --> 17:15.406
We can take it from here.
You're off anyway.

17:15.626 --> 17:17.749
- Thanks.
- Curtain Area 2.

17:17.961 --> 17:21.413
Mr. Chattarowski, I'm Dr. Greene.
This is Nurse Hathaway.

17:21.632 --> 17:23.126
We'd like to welcome you back.

17:23.342 --> 17:27.839
I know I screwed up, doc.
I'm a screwup by nature.

17:28.556 --> 17:31.759
I want to make a clean start.
I really do.

17:31.976 --> 17:35.891
You won't make a very clean start
with booze in your hand.

17:36.106 --> 17:37.683
That was my last drink.

17:38.692 --> 17:42.108
I'm not gonna poison myself no more.
I promise.

17:42.321 --> 17:44.990
Other than bloodshot,
the eyes look okay. Lean forward.

17:45.199 --> 17:47.607
I'm gonna get clean and sober, doc.

17:47.785 --> 17:50.656
You gotta be quiet
so I can hear your lungs.

17:53.875 --> 17:55.951
BP's 130 palp.

17:56.586 --> 17:59.207
Mr. Chattarowski, I'm gonna try
to get you a detox bed.

17:59.422 --> 18:01.249
But promise me you'll stay.

18:02.384 --> 18:06.429
I promise. I really do.

18:06.638 --> 18:09.094
I'm gonna get clean and sober.

18:09.308 --> 18:11.846
If you could just scoot over
to this bed for me.

18:16.732 --> 18:18.108
You think he'll stay?

18:18.317 --> 18:21.852
I was a cynic with Miss Coco
and we saw how that worked out.

18:22.071 --> 18:25.108
So karmically,
I have to believe this guy.

18:25.325 --> 18:28.112
Okay, Dr. Karma. But I'm gonna
lock up his clothes...

18:28.328 --> 18:30.535
...so it's harder for him
to escape this time.

18:30.747 --> 18:32.123
Good idea.

18:34.334 --> 18:38.167
Amanda, you have to stay still.
It'll only hurt for a second.

18:38.339 --> 18:40.628
No, Daddy!

18:40.841 --> 18:45.171
- If you're good I'll give you stickers.
- I don't want stickers, Daddy!

18:45.388 --> 18:48.674
- Is this really necessary?
- Unfortunately, it is.

18:48.850 --> 18:51.685
- We have to take blood to do the test.
- I want to go home.

18:51.895 --> 18:53.472
- Everything all right?
- Yes, fine.

18:53.647 --> 18:55.307
My little girl's afraid of needles.

18:55.482 --> 18:57.558
Is there a way to test her
without all this?

18:57.734 --> 18:59.063
Yes, there is.

18:59.278 --> 19:01.947
- What have we got?
- Barbie Kligman, 11-year-old, MVA.

19:02.114 --> 19:03.858
Back-seat passenger with a lap belt.

19:04.074 --> 19:08.902
Complains of abdominal pain.
BP 105/70. Pulse 95.

19:09.121 --> 19:12.822
Let's get a CBC, Chem-20,
type and hold and dip a urine.

19:13.042 --> 19:14.869
Barbie, does your neck hurt?

19:15.044 --> 19:16.420
No. Just my stomach.

19:17.547 --> 19:19.374
Pulse ox is 98 on room air.

19:19.591 --> 19:21.133
- Chest is clear.
- Okay.

19:21.343 --> 19:22.671
Dale okay with this?

19:22.844 --> 19:24.884
- Shouldn't be a problem.
- All right.

19:25.055 --> 19:26.929
Pupils are 5 mm and react to light.

19:27.141 --> 19:30.177
- Will she be okay, doctor?
- We're taking care of her.

19:30.394 --> 19:32.387
- Pretty good seat-belt contusion.
- Yeah.

19:33.731 --> 19:36.566
- Bowel sounds are absent.
- Hemoglobin's 14. 1.

19:36.734 --> 19:39.107
Okay. Listen, does this hurt?

19:39.320 --> 19:40.649
- What?
- She has a bruise...

19:40.864 --> 19:43.437
...that's often associated
with small bowel injuries.

19:43.658 --> 19:47.158
We'll do a CAT scan of the belly,
but she may need exploratory surgery.

19:47.371 --> 19:49.826
- Oh, my God.
- You'll be okay, Barbie.

19:50.040 --> 19:52.247
Mommy and Daddy are here
for you, okay?

19:52.459 --> 19:53.788
That's all it takes?

19:53.961 --> 19:59.585
The machine delivers lidocaine to the
skin by iontophoresis. No needles.

19:59.800 --> 20:03.252
- Hey.
- Dr. Weaver, we meet again.

20:03.429 --> 20:05.339
I thought you had a plane to catch.

20:05.557 --> 20:09.637
Flight delay. Hanging out here beats
watered-down airport cocktails.

20:09.811 --> 20:11.140
Can I play fly on the wall?

20:11.354 --> 20:13.098
Dr. Ross' Pedes room.

20:13.273 --> 20:15.599
Sure. Hang out.
Here we go, sweetheart.

20:15.776 --> 20:17.104
How are you, Amanda?

20:17.277 --> 20:18.606
- Okay.
- You're okay?

20:18.779 --> 20:22.444
Now this pad puts your
skin to sleep.

20:22.616 --> 20:24.241
You're not gonna feel anything.

20:24.452 --> 20:27.488
Now, close your eyes, sweetheart.

20:28.623 --> 20:30.829
- You feel anything?
- No.

20:31.000 --> 20:33.040
- Okay.
- That's amazing.

20:33.211 --> 20:36.960
We tried numbing it with cream
but it takes an hour. This is great.

20:37.132 --> 20:39.421
It really is.
What's it called again?

20:39.635 --> 20:41.461
Numby.

20:42.846 --> 20:45.420
We did the phase-three clinical
trials at Bellevue.

20:45.599 --> 20:48.007
We've been using it
for over a year now.

20:56.486 --> 20:57.814
Hey, Dr. Carter.

20:58.029 --> 20:59.523
Nice costume.

20:59.698 --> 21:01.821
I feel kind of lame.
Nobody else dressed up.

21:01.992 --> 21:04.317
Well, it's early yet.
People may still show.

21:04.494 --> 21:05.823
The flier said 8.

21:06.038 --> 21:08.790
Remember, these are med students.
They're busy.

21:08.957 --> 21:10.416
Want me to get you some punch?

21:10.584 --> 21:11.913
Oh, later.

21:12.086 --> 21:15.585
I gotta pull articles at the library
for this conference tomorrow.

21:15.798 --> 21:17.625
Think this party can chaperone itself?

21:17.842 --> 21:20.843
- I'll look after things for you.
- Why don't you do that?

21:23.473 --> 21:25.929
- How old is this girl?
- Eleven.

21:26.142 --> 21:28.716
- What's the glitter on her face?
- She's a princess.

21:30.022 --> 21:33.058
- Dale, get a clamp on that.
- Babcock, please.

21:33.567 --> 21:35.726
There's a little bleeding around
the duodenum.

21:35.903 --> 21:38.192
Let's cauterize and explore
the retroperitoneum.

21:38.364 --> 21:39.609
Bovie.

21:39.824 --> 21:42.493
- What are you doing for Halloween?
- Nothing special.

21:42.702 --> 21:45.822
I know a motel on Route 22.
Jungle-theme rooms.

21:45.997 --> 21:48.203
- Metz.
- Ask for room 14. Hanging vines.

21:48.416 --> 21:50.243
You Tarzan, she Jane.
Know what I mean?

21:50.460 --> 21:52.369
I think we'll just stay in town.

21:52.587 --> 21:55.707
- All right. The pancreas looks good.
- No renal injuries here.

21:55.882 --> 21:57.875
Hold on. There's infrarenal mass.

21:58.093 --> 22:00.002
Looks like a lumbar node.

22:01.013 --> 22:02.804
Doesn't feel right. It's too rubbery.

22:02.973 --> 22:05.346
There's one on this side too.
Could be lymphoma.

22:05.559 --> 22:08.229
All right, let's send for a biopsy.
Number 15.

22:09.605 --> 22:10.981
Everything okay on the wards?

22:11.190 --> 22:12.519
Yes. May I scrub in?

22:12.734 --> 22:15.106
- We could use your help.
- Wonderful.

22:15.320 --> 22:18.025
We just biopsied an abnormal
lymph node on Barbie.

22:18.240 --> 22:22.451
Why don't you take this specimen to
Pathology and wait on the results.

22:25.706 --> 22:28.244
Just signed in three more kids.
We're stacked.

22:28.417 --> 22:31.786
- We're getting to them.
- We need the main ER for the overflow.

22:32.004 --> 22:34.127
I have to see these kids.
You saw Kerry.

22:34.340 --> 22:37.507
It's a busy night, Doug.
You can't see them all by yourself.

22:38.386 --> 22:42.254
Send the overflow to the main ER,
but send me the kids' charts.

22:42.432 --> 22:43.760
- Of course.
- Okay.

22:43.934 --> 22:47.552
- The sickest ones, send them to me.
- I wouldn't do it any other way.

22:48.397 --> 22:50.520
What are you doing back so early?

22:50.732 --> 22:54.600
Me and Ariel are sick of trick-or-
treating and Mom's running late.

22:54.820 --> 22:57.525
- What are you watching?
- Family Love Triangles.

22:57.740 --> 23:00.148
- Educational TV, huh?
- Yeah.

23:00.368 --> 23:02.360
Mom says when we move
to St. Louis...

23:02.578 --> 23:06.576
...she's only gonna let me watch
an hour of television a day.

23:06.791 --> 23:09.627
When you move to St. Louis?

23:09.794 --> 23:11.253
You didn't know?

23:14.007 --> 23:16.677
I think that's why
Mom wanted to see you.

23:17.261 --> 23:18.636
So it's a done deal then?

23:18.846 --> 23:20.720
My room will be twice as big.

23:20.931 --> 23:23.636
And there's a park across the street
for the dogs.

23:23.851 --> 23:26.307
- Sounds nice.
- It's really pretty there.

23:27.897 --> 23:30.139
Please don't tell her I told you, okay?

23:30.358 --> 23:32.600
Hey, my lips are sealed.

23:33.320 --> 23:36.771
Repair transversely with running
Vicryl 3-0.

23:36.990 --> 23:39.362
Gentlemen, I have the results
of your biopsy.

23:39.576 --> 23:41.818
Care to guess what we saw
under the microscope?

23:42.037 --> 23:43.994
- Gotta be Hodgkin's.
- No.

23:44.206 --> 23:46.662
- Metastatic adeno?
- Wrong again.

23:46.876 --> 23:48.418
Seminiferous tubules.

23:49.795 --> 23:51.338
- What?
- You're kidding?

23:51.547 --> 23:55.960
You biopsied two testicles.
It seems that Barbie is a boy.

23:58.012 --> 24:00.883
Who knew there were so many texts
on the bowel?

24:01.099 --> 24:03.341
This is just what I could
get my hands on.

24:03.560 --> 24:05.802
I suppose with all this
intense interest...

24:06.021 --> 24:09.936
...that means our bowels are in good
hands for many years to come, right?

24:10.150 --> 24:11.479
That's a nice thought.

24:11.694 --> 24:14.980
Hey, sounds like
the party's up and running.

24:22.205 --> 24:23.747
Yeah!

24:49.901 --> 24:53.946
Dr. Carter, the party picked up.
The beers are right there.

24:56.450 --> 24:59.617
Nice aim, dude. You almost put out
the fire with that one.

25:01.622 --> 25:04.030
Hey, Dr. Carter.

25:04.250 --> 25:05.874
Thanks, dude.

25:19.850 --> 25:22.602
Okay, kids, that's it. Party's over.

25:22.769 --> 25:25.177
You don't have to go home,
but you can't stay here.

25:25.397 --> 25:26.939
What's up? Were we too loud?

25:27.149 --> 25:30.316
- No, the furniture was too on fire.
- Oh, really? I'm sorry.

25:30.528 --> 25:32.236
I'll be in my room studying.

25:32.405 --> 25:33.780
Happy Halloween!

25:33.990 --> 25:35.318
She did it to me again.

25:35.491 --> 25:37.817
She's in escrow and I heard
about it from Rachel.

25:37.994 --> 25:40.034
Maybe she was
gonna tell you tonight?

25:40.372 --> 25:41.700
Maybe.

25:41.915 --> 25:46.127
Or maybe she was just going to send
me a postcard from St. Louis.

25:46.336 --> 25:48.412
You really had a good time
with Rachel, huh?

25:48.630 --> 25:51.750
Yeah. Yeah, I did.

25:52.593 --> 25:54.336
How's Chattarowski's detox search?

25:54.553 --> 25:56.427
They're all out of beds on Four East...

25:56.639 --> 26:00.589
...but I stood my ground and insisted
that he was a good detox candidate.

26:00.810 --> 26:03.597
They finally gave him
a place on Four West.

26:03.813 --> 26:05.438
You must owe them some favors.

26:05.648 --> 26:07.890
A couple. But it was worth it.

26:10.487 --> 26:13.025
Well, you tried, you know?

26:14.032 --> 26:16.440
When we explored
the retroperitoneum...

26:16.660 --> 26:18.617
...we discovered two small masses.

26:18.829 --> 26:20.786
Masses? What kind of masses?

26:20.998 --> 26:24.332
We were concerned, so we sent down
a frozen section of the biopsy...

26:24.544 --> 26:26.786
...that revealed testicular tissue.

26:27.547 --> 26:28.922
What does that mean?

26:29.883 --> 26:33.168
Barbie has a condition called
testicular feminization.

26:33.845 --> 26:37.428
Genetically, she's a male
with XY chromosomes.

26:37.641 --> 26:42.054
During development, the fetal tissue
was resistant to testosterone...

26:42.271 --> 26:45.023
...and the external genitalia
developed as female.

26:45.232 --> 26:46.976
There's gotta be a mistake.

26:47.193 --> 26:50.977
No mistake. The vagina's nothing
but a blind pouch.

26:51.197 --> 26:53.605
No uterus or ovaries.

26:53.825 --> 26:56.316
She'll need to be on estrogen
replacement therapy.

26:56.536 --> 26:58.992
My little girl has testicles?

26:59.164 --> 27:03.244
We removed them because of the high
incidence of malignant transformation.

27:03.460 --> 27:04.705
I don't understand.

27:05.546 --> 27:08.547
I changed her diapers.
I know every inch of her.

27:08.757 --> 27:10.086
She's a boy?

27:10.718 --> 27:14.004
The genetics don't matter.
You've raised Barbie as a girl.

27:14.221 --> 27:18.089
It's what she looks like. It's her
identity. Nothing will change that.

27:18.309 --> 27:22.259
But you have to understand that she'll
never menstruate or bear children.

27:28.236 --> 27:30.775
Obviously this has come as a shock.

27:30.948 --> 27:34.198
You'll need time to adjust.
Barbie's recovering.

27:35.786 --> 27:38.324
We'll refer you to
a genetic counselor.

27:38.539 --> 27:41.457
They'll help you decide when
and how to tell her.

27:42.919 --> 27:44.911
Thank you, doctor.

27:55.265 --> 27:57.803
- Nice job.
- Thank you.

27:58.018 --> 28:01.850
You forgot to mention they'll have to
change Barbie's name to Ken.

28:04.191 --> 28:06.268
After the day I've had,
just line them up.

28:06.485 --> 28:10.436
Word. That's how you gotta do it, man.
Work hard, play hard.

28:10.615 --> 28:11.943
I deserve to play hard.

28:12.116 --> 28:15.486
I had to check all the stool samples
for fecal leukocytes, dude.

28:15.662 --> 28:16.990
You think that's bad?

28:17.164 --> 28:20.497
My Resident had me give physical exams
to these homeless shelter guys.

28:20.709 --> 28:23.959
One had maggots crawling
all over an abscess.

28:24.129 --> 28:26.371
At least your Residents
acknowledge you.

28:26.590 --> 28:28.382
Mine don't even know I'm here.

28:28.592 --> 28:31.380
I get more respect from
this rubber arm.

28:35.266 --> 28:37.389
We might have saved
this guy with the saw.

28:37.602 --> 28:39.844
We could've cut
the sternum in two seconds...

28:40.021 --> 28:41.813
...instead of chiseling for a minute.

28:41.982 --> 28:44.687
The guy was dead. A few
seconds wouldn't have saved him.

28:44.860 --> 28:46.354
It would've given him a chance.

28:46.570 --> 28:49.322
We are not going to waste
time training ER docs...

28:49.531 --> 28:51.987
...on equipment
they'll use once a year.

28:52.201 --> 28:55.036
If we had the saw, we could give
midline thoracotomies...

28:55.246 --> 28:57.322
...for all penetrating chest traumas.

28:57.498 --> 28:59.040
That's not the standard of care.

28:59.250 --> 29:02.370
The standard of care
gives miserable results.

29:02.545 --> 29:04.668
If they arrest in the ambulance,
10% survive.

29:04.881 --> 29:07.289
If they arrest in the ER,
30% survive.

29:07.509 --> 29:11.803
Midline thoracotomy gives us better
exposure to repair cardiac injuries.

29:12.014 --> 29:14.968
All right. If you're so damned
interested in this, do a study.

29:15.142 --> 29:16.470
- All right, I will.
- Good.

29:16.644 --> 29:19.395
I know exactly the guy from
Surgery to help you. Peter?

29:19.605 --> 29:22.855
Kerry and I were discussing
a study between ER and Surgery.

29:23.025 --> 29:27.438
- A study?
- Midline thoracotomy for chest trauma.

29:27.614 --> 29:28.942
Is this because of today?

29:29.157 --> 29:32.193
Draw up a proposal with a budget
and give it to me in two weeks.

29:32.369 --> 29:33.697
- I will.
- Good. Okay.

29:33.870 --> 29:36.658
I don't think ER docs should
play with a sternal saw.

29:36.873 --> 29:38.747
- Neither do I.
- Then why support her?

29:38.959 --> 29:41.581
I'm not. She'll spin her
wheels, write a proposal...

29:41.795 --> 29:45.840
...and it won't pass the Human
Subjects Committee in a million years.

29:47.009 --> 29:50.046
- M&M?
- Oh, no, no.

29:53.099 --> 29:56.800
Listen, I made reservations
at Dempsey's for 10.

29:57.020 --> 29:59.013
Peter, I don't know.
I'm pretty swamped.

29:59.189 --> 30:00.517
What? It's Halloween.

30:00.690 --> 30:05.269
Yeah, but Dempsey's isn't really
Halloween-y. No, it'll keep.

30:18.751 --> 30:20.329
Walt, what's up, man? It's me.

30:20.545 --> 30:24.377
Listen, I need to ask you a favor.

30:25.091 --> 30:27.417
See this one? That's the bull rider.

30:27.594 --> 30:28.923
Oh, right. The cute cowboy.

30:29.137 --> 30:30.715
Dad!

30:30.889 --> 30:35.302
Rach, did I hear your order right?
You hate rhubarb and walnuts.

30:35.519 --> 30:39.434
I like it now. Dad makes good pie.

30:39.690 --> 30:43.106
- He always did.
- Jen, you trying to butter me up?

30:43.361 --> 30:46.944
No. I just remember your mom's
famous rhubarb pie recipe.

30:48.325 --> 30:51.445
Sorry you're working late with a cold.
Are you holding up?

30:51.661 --> 30:53.868
Yeah, it's just my sinuses.

30:54.081 --> 30:55.741
Why don't you go wash your hands?

30:55.916 --> 30:57.825
Okay.

31:01.338 --> 31:03.497
St. Louis, huh?

31:04.216 --> 31:06.126
- She told you?
- Slipped out.

31:06.302 --> 31:09.387
It's a great job, Mark.
The schools are top-rate and-

31:09.597 --> 31:11.673
It sounds good.

31:14.978 --> 31:16.472
I was ready for a fight.

31:17.731 --> 31:20.981
I think we've done enough fighting
for a lifetime, don't you?

31:22.402 --> 31:23.945
Yeah.

31:24.154 --> 31:25.483
In a perfect world...

31:25.698 --> 31:31.701
...we could both spend 365 days
a year with her. But we can't.

31:32.789 --> 31:35.706
- St. Louis isn't very far.
- No.

31:36.626 --> 31:39.295
And I'll have holidays and summers.

31:41.089 --> 31:46.001
Spending time with her this summer
has made me think about how...

31:47.596 --> 31:50.431
...we've spent way too much time
thinking about ourselves.

31:52.017 --> 31:54.639
She told me you guys got along
really well.

31:55.521 --> 31:57.265
Yeah.

31:58.232 --> 32:00.937
Yeah, it was...

32:03.947 --> 32:06.699
It was a lot- It was a lot of fun.

32:14.208 --> 32:15.832
Thank you.

32:17.670 --> 32:19.828
Is it still Halloween?

32:21.090 --> 32:23.415
Yes. You have a few more hours left.

32:24.677 --> 32:28.177
I guess I won't be able to go
trick-or-treating.

32:28.389 --> 32:31.307
Not this year. I'm sorry.

32:32.602 --> 32:33.931
Some day, huh?

32:35.355 --> 32:37.063
That's okay.

32:37.274 --> 32:40.643
The best part was making
the costume anyway.

32:40.819 --> 32:43.737
Me and my mom made it together.

32:46.075 --> 32:47.617
Do you still have my tiara?

32:50.079 --> 32:51.906
Yes.

32:52.206 --> 32:54.246
Yes, right here.

32:56.753 --> 32:58.378
Wait. Let me do that.

33:02.092 --> 33:03.420
There.

33:03.594 --> 33:04.922
How do I look?

33:05.929 --> 33:09.714
Like a beautiful fairy princess.

33:16.190 --> 33:17.934
No!

33:18.109 --> 33:19.817
Drink up, Bernie.

33:21.071 --> 33:23.644
Some people cannot hold their liquor!

33:23.865 --> 33:25.443
We should mess with his mind.

33:25.617 --> 33:28.322
You mean the hand in the warm
water trick?

33:28.537 --> 33:30.494
Not on the couch, Lucy. Come on.

33:30.706 --> 33:32.284
I got it. I got it.

33:32.458 --> 33:35.708
Come on, stop it.

33:36.462 --> 33:37.837
Do you think he's okay?

33:38.047 --> 33:40.289
Yeah. He's just a lightweight,
that's all.

33:40.466 --> 33:42.708
He has a strong pulse
and he's still breathing.

33:42.927 --> 33:44.920
You've been in the ER way too long.

33:45.096 --> 33:46.756
Let's get this party started right!

33:46.973 --> 33:49.511
- Willie? Willie?
- What shave his head?

33:49.726 --> 33:51.635
That would be cruel and unusual.

33:51.812 --> 33:54.267
This is mean. This is mean!

33:54.439 --> 33:56.728
You ain't seen nothing yet.

33:58.319 --> 34:00.276
Even drunk, that should still work.

34:01.280 --> 34:03.522
No. Stop, stop. Wait, wait. Willie?

34:03.699 --> 34:05.739
- Willie?
- Willie, wake up!

34:05.952 --> 34:09.155
Someone needs to call 911,
and go get Carter.

34:09.330 --> 34:11.536
Get real. If we call Carter, he'll narc.

34:11.750 --> 34:13.908
Willie's in trouble.
We need to do something.

34:14.127 --> 34:16.583
Bernie's right. We can handle this.

34:16.797 --> 34:18.835
This is not class, this is our friend.

34:19.007 --> 34:21.878
You guys call 911.
I'm gonna go get Carter.

34:28.476 --> 34:30.717
Dr. Carter?

34:30.937 --> 34:33.309
Wake up, Dr. Carter!

34:33.523 --> 34:34.898
Wake up!

34:37.402 --> 34:40.356
Okay, everybody back off.
Give him some air.

34:40.530 --> 34:42.772
- Anybody call 911?
- I did, Dr. Carter.

34:42.991 --> 34:45.399
Come on, Willie, wake up.
Wake up!

34:46.119 --> 34:48.243
A weak pulse,
but he's not breathing.

34:48.455 --> 34:49.914
Oh, man.

34:55.254 --> 34:58.006
- Oh, gross!
- Can I do anything? What can I do?

34:58.716 --> 35:02.002
- He vomited. That's good, right?
- No, that's bad.

35:03.138 --> 35:07.847
If he vomits and it gets in his lungs,
he'll die of aspiration pneumonia.

35:08.059 --> 35:11.559
His parents live in Downers Grove.
Give them a call.

35:11.772 --> 35:13.396
We're up here! Second floor!

35:13.607 --> 35:16.181
"X"? What's that?

35:16.443 --> 35:18.317
- It's liquid Ecstasy.
- What is that?

35:18.529 --> 35:20.356
It's a narcotic.
Anybody else take it?

35:20.531 --> 35:21.907
I didn't know Willie took it.

35:22.116 --> 35:24.442
- Branch took some earlier.
- I can't leave Willie.

35:24.661 --> 35:26.321
I'll go.

35:27.413 --> 35:29.987
It was clean. They showed the replay
a million times.

35:30.166 --> 35:33.286
- It was a joke how offsides they were!
- You're dreaming. Pay up.

35:33.503 --> 35:36.457
- That was Lucky Liquor.
- A vagrant's best friend?

35:36.673 --> 35:40.754
They have a guy in a county patient
gown with a IV bag trying to buy beer.

35:40.928 --> 35:43.466
Whatever happened to
"No shirt, no shoes, no service"?

35:43.681 --> 35:46.089
They'll stall him until someone
comes for him...

35:46.309 --> 35:48.597
...but they won't hang on all day.

35:48.770 --> 35:50.762
Tell you what- Hey, Grabarsky.

35:50.938 --> 35:53.311
You go and pick this guy up
and we're even.

35:53.525 --> 35:55.398
- How's that sound?
- This drunk a friend?

35:55.610 --> 35:57.104
No, but he owes me more than you.

35:57.779 --> 35:59.653
Consider him admitted.

35:59.865 --> 36:01.774
- Where is he?
- He went to take a shower.

36:01.992 --> 36:04.364
- How's Willie?
- Paramedics intubated him.

36:04.578 --> 36:05.609
Liquid Ecstasy.

36:05.704 --> 36:07.993
You got to admit that you'd think
med students would know better.

36:08.207 --> 36:12.371
Yeah, you would. Branch! Branch!

36:16.090 --> 36:19.791
Branch, wake up!
Let's get him out of here.

36:22.472 --> 36:23.966
- He's not moving air.
- No pulse.

36:24.141 --> 36:26.548
- Damn it!
- I'll start chest compressions.

36:32.191 --> 36:34.563
Where's the syringe?

36:34.777 --> 36:38.561
- Find the paramedics. I'll do CPR.
- Okay.

36:45.914 --> 36:50.327
Mr. Lubin just spiked to 101.4.
Go ahead and draw a fever workup.

36:51.211 --> 36:55.754
Draw Setzer for a pre and post
gentamicin level with the 11:00 dose.

36:55.966 --> 36:58.338
- Hey, how's it going?
- We're rather busy.

36:58.510 --> 37:01.796
But I've got a great little
intern helping me out.

37:03.432 --> 37:06.932
Dale, listen. It's 10:30
and you're not even on.

37:07.145 --> 37:11.807
So sign out the scut.
That's what the on-call team is for.

37:12.025 --> 37:13.934
Unless you have a problem with that?

37:15.529 --> 37:17.402
That's fine.

37:20.492 --> 37:22.284
You ready?

37:23.120 --> 37:25.694
Give me 10 minutes to get back
into my costume.

37:25.873 --> 37:27.996
- You're really gonna wear it?
- Of course.

37:28.209 --> 37:31.080
Okay. When you're ready,
I'll be out front.

37:31.295 --> 37:33.787
Look, just tell me you wanted
to be an airline pilot.

37:34.007 --> 37:37.127
Please, I don't even like taking
the puddle-jumper to Cleveland.

37:37.302 --> 37:38.630
Hurry up.

37:40.639 --> 37:43.212
This is police harassment!
Remember Rodney King!

37:43.433 --> 37:46.388
Dr. G, here's your man.
Put up quite a fight.

37:46.603 --> 37:49.474
Said it's Halloween
and he's just playing dress up.

37:49.690 --> 37:51.149
I am!

37:51.358 --> 37:53.066
Grabarsky, it's the wrong guy.

37:53.277 --> 37:55.603
Lucky Liquor.
Big guy in a hospital gown.

37:55.780 --> 37:57.938
- He kind of looks like-
- Jerry!

37:58.616 --> 37:59.945
Lloyd.

38:01.536 --> 38:03.363
- What are you doing here?
- Who's Lloyd?

38:03.580 --> 38:05.039
I'm that knucklehead's cousin.

38:05.248 --> 38:07.574
Who knew they'd hit the genetic
Powerball twice?

38:07.751 --> 38:09.411
Jerry?

38:11.463 --> 38:13.622
See, he needed a costume...

38:13.841 --> 38:15.917
...and there's a contest at
the Elks Lodge-

38:16.093 --> 38:17.469
I won "Honorable Mention".

38:18.679 --> 38:20.802
Congratulations.

38:22.475 --> 38:23.934
Need anything else, Doug?

38:24.102 --> 38:26.344
Other than a 48-hour day?

38:26.563 --> 38:28.354
I'm leaving.
See you bright and early.

38:28.565 --> 38:30.356
- Bright and early.
- Yep.

38:31.067 --> 38:35.813
- Hey, Doug, you did a nice job today.
- Not bad for a rookie Attending.

38:36.031 --> 38:38.154
Let's see how you do with these.

38:38.534 --> 38:39.862
What's that?

38:40.035 --> 38:43.867
Overflow charts for the pediatric
patients in the main ER.

38:44.081 --> 38:47.082
According to policy,
you need to sign off on them.

38:49.796 --> 38:51.338
You're loving this, aren't you?

38:51.548 --> 38:54.549
This Pedes ER isn't such a bad
idea after all.

38:54.759 --> 38:57.215
Happy Halloween, rookie.

38:58.555 --> 39:02.173
Branch Crockett and Willie Goldman,
ages 22 and 23.

39:02.392 --> 39:04.966
Mixed overdose of alcohol and GHB.

39:05.187 --> 39:07.643
Willie's intubated from
a respiratory arrest.

39:07.857 --> 39:10.145
Branch came back with epi
after a full arrest.

39:10.359 --> 39:12.186
A little late-night club-hopping?

39:12.403 --> 39:15.274
No, med school Halloween party.

39:16.699 --> 39:18.906
All right, everybody. On my count:

39:19.119 --> 39:20.827
One, two, three.

39:21.621 --> 39:24.492
CBC, ABG, lytes, blood alcohol...

39:24.708 --> 39:27.994
...tox screen and a 12-lead.
Call Respiratory for a vent.

39:28.170 --> 39:29.498
Someone call his parents.

39:29.671 --> 39:31.249
- Lucy can do that.
- No, I'll help.

39:31.840 --> 39:33.667
You're drunk.
You don't belong in here.

39:35.344 --> 39:36.720
Now, get out.

39:49.818 --> 39:53.401
Peter, have you gone
completely balmy?

39:56.533 --> 39:59.025
Just getting funky.

39:59.203 --> 40:01.196
Hey, meet my nephew, Peanut.

40:01.372 --> 40:03.614
- Nice to meet you.
- Hello.

40:04.250 --> 40:05.578
It's a hayride?

40:05.752 --> 40:07.875
- It's a hayride.
- So where to, Uncle Pete?

40:08.087 --> 40:10.413
Michigan Ave. Pop that 8-track in.

40:10.590 --> 40:12.382
Solid.

40:17.889 --> 40:19.265
You don't get it?

40:20.684 --> 40:23.602
You never figured out
who I wanted to be as a kid.

40:25.481 --> 40:26.809
Oh, my God!

40:27.024 --> 40:29.231
Shaft!

40:30.862 --> 40:32.938
John Shaft.

40:38.912 --> 40:41.996
Hey, Dr. Weaver. Off to enjoy
All Hallows Eve?

40:42.207 --> 40:47.119
Actually, I am. I just wanted
to give you this bill.

40:50.800 --> 40:52.757
Two hundred eighty-nine dollars?

40:52.969 --> 40:56.420
You're lucky the wheelchair wasn't
damaged. It could've been worse.

40:56.597 --> 40:57.973
I don't have 300 bucks.

40:58.182 --> 41:00.756
I've arranged to take it
out of your paycheck.

41:00.935 --> 41:04.139
Twenty-eight ninety a week
for the next 10 weeks.

41:04.314 --> 41:06.437
That'll run right into
the holiday season.

41:06.608 --> 41:07.937
Kerry, got a second?

41:08.110 --> 41:09.438
Yeah. What's going on?

41:09.611 --> 41:12.482
I wanted to give you a heads-up
on the committee vote.

41:12.698 --> 41:14.774
That won't be announced
until tomorrow.

41:14.950 --> 41:18.735
Well, they've tallied it already,
and they voted for Litvak.

41:20.248 --> 41:24.328
They're gonna have to widen
the office door for his swollen head.

41:24.502 --> 41:27.337
Yeah, he's kind of an ass, isn't he?

41:27.547 --> 41:30.797
Well, if it means anything,
I voted for you.

41:30.967 --> 41:32.759
Thanks, Mark.

41:32.969 --> 41:35.543
Which paycheck does this
become effective?

41:36.849 --> 41:38.925
You know what?

41:39.143 --> 41:40.970
It doesn't.

41:41.145 --> 41:43.636
- Are you serious?
- I'm dead serious.

41:43.856 --> 41:48.317
Give your cousin a wheelchair, give
your maiden aunt a rapid infuser.

41:48.486 --> 41:50.942
I don't give a damn.

41:51.156 --> 41:53.943
- You're getting obsessive.
- Did I hand you angiocaths?

41:54.159 --> 41:56.068
- Yeah. A gross.
- What's a gross?

41:56.286 --> 41:58.824
One-forty-four, and you did.
Are you listening?

41:58.997 --> 42:02.995
Yes, I am. All work and no play
makes Doug a dull boy.

42:03.168 --> 42:06.953
Look at this. I ordered three
cases of Pedialyte, this is Pediazole.

42:10.051 --> 42:11.878
Doug, you all right?

42:12.094 --> 42:13.719
Oh, my God! Hold it!

42:13.930 --> 42:16.172
Put pressure on it!

42:17.142 --> 42:18.470
You bastard.

42:18.685 --> 42:20.512
You can dish it out,
you can't take it.

42:20.687 --> 42:22.680
- Payback is a bitch, isn't it?
- You suck.

42:22.898 --> 42:25.305
Good evening.
I want to suck your blood.

42:25.525 --> 42:28.277
No, I'm not kissing back.

42:32.074 --> 42:34.316
Hey, Dr. Carter.

42:35.536 --> 42:37.778
- Lucy.
- How are they?

42:37.997 --> 42:40.037
They'll be fine.

42:41.626 --> 42:42.954
I don't know what happened.

42:44.045 --> 42:45.837
One second
we were hanging out, then-

42:46.006 --> 42:48.497
What happened was two of your
classmates almost died.

42:51.219 --> 42:52.928
I didn't know they were doing GHB.

42:53.639 --> 42:55.964
You were in charge of the party.

42:56.517 --> 42:59.886
I broke it up when things got out
of hand. You continued to party.

43:00.062 --> 43:02.898
Two guys rolled out of here
on gurneys.

43:04.108 --> 43:05.437
Did I miss anything?

43:05.652 --> 43:08.569
The part about me not being able
to police everyone.

43:10.907 --> 43:13.908
And about you being the
Resident Adviser and the one in charge.

43:14.119 --> 43:16.444
You're right, Lucy. I'm in charge.

43:16.663 --> 43:21.372
It was stupid of me to think you were
mature enough to take responsibility.

43:54.453 --> 43:57.123
I never knew you didn't have rhythm.

43:57.624 --> 44:00.197
You're messing up the greatest song.
Here we go.

44:00.418 --> 44:02.541
- What is that?
- It's my tambourine!

44:02.754 --> 44:04.414
That's a tambourine?

44:04.631 --> 44:07.751
Come on, come on, come on.
Get some rhythm in here.
