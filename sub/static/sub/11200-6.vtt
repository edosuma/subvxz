WEBVTT

00:01.768 --> 00:04.202
NARRATOR: Previously, on Stargate SG-1.

00:04.538 --> 00:06.062
Come back and rejoin SG-1.

00:06.173 --> 00:07.902
I have my reasons for wanting this job.

00:08.008 --> 00:09.305
What if the world needs saving?

00:09.409 --> 00:11.877
If the world needs saving
I will be there to do what I can.

00:11.978 --> 00:15.880
ARLOS: The bracelets create
a physiological bond between the wearers.

00:15.982 --> 00:17.313
They were used by the Goa 'uld.

00:17.417 --> 00:19.476
Jackson! Jackson!

00:19.586 --> 00:22.077
You were completely unresponsive
when we brought you in,

00:22.189 --> 00:25.124
but your condition suddenly improved
when she came back.

00:25.225 --> 00:26.214
Miss me?

00:26.326 --> 00:27.315
Who is that?

00:27.427 --> 00:31.693
A gentleman who claims that
he represents some gods called the Ori.

00:31.798 --> 00:34.631
There are as many humans out there
as there are Jaffa.

00:34.735 --> 00:36.396
LANDRY: If we don't continue
to work together,

00:36.503 --> 00:39.028
the victory we worked so Iong
and hard for

00:39.139 --> 00:40.868
could result in chaos.

00:46.513 --> 00:49.607
-BlRRA: You show no fear, Latal.
-He is one man. What is there to fear?

00:49.716 --> 00:53.652
He promised retribution if we did not bow
to their gods upon his return.

00:53.754 --> 00:57.520
The Jaffa have shed too much blood
to replace one false god with another.

00:57.657 --> 01:00.148
We have made our decision,
and we will tell him.

01:03.730 --> 01:05.095
(CHANTING)

01:08.568 --> 01:10.331
Have you come alone?

01:10.604 --> 01:13.004
The Ori are with me always.

01:13.907 --> 01:17.502
-You have read from The Book of Origin?
-We have.

01:17.911 --> 01:20.812
What say you to the promise of the Ori?

01:23.049 --> 01:25.813
We will hear no more of false gods.

01:27.621 --> 01:30.021
Go now and we will spare your life.

01:30.323 --> 01:32.052
You speak for all?

01:32.759 --> 01:34.021
We do.

01:35.962 --> 01:40.695
One way or another,
this world will serve their purpose.

01:45.739 --> 01:47.331
Jaffa!

02:13.633 --> 02:15.191
(CHANTING)

03:35.916 --> 03:38.407
Unscheduled offworld activation.

03:38.518 --> 03:39.815
What have we got, chief?

03:39.920 --> 03:42.150
Receiving a message, sir. It's text only.

03:45.091 --> 03:46.217
(RUMBLING)

03:50.530 --> 03:52.157
It's in Goa'uld.

03:52.666 --> 03:55.635
None of you folks read Goa'uld, do you?

04:02.642 --> 04:03.939
(EXCLAIMING)

04:06.146 --> 04:08.046
You boys aren't gonna let people
from two different planets

04:08.148 --> 04:09.342
beat you at your own silly game, are you?

04:09.449 --> 04:11.007
The silly game isn't over yet.

04:11.151 --> 04:13.415
-That's my wingman.
-You need a new wingman.

04:13.520 --> 04:16.284
-I'm gonna kick your ass.
-Promises, promises.

04:22.228 --> 04:25.459
As you were, Colonel.
Actually, I was looking for Teal'c.

04:25.865 --> 04:29.426
We received a communiqué
from a Goa'uld named Nerus.

04:29.536 --> 04:32.903
-Ring any bells?
-I am aware of his identity.

04:34.074 --> 04:37.441
He was a minor Goa'uld
who served Ba'al for many centuries.

04:37.544 --> 04:40.638
-What can you tell me about him?
-VALA: Honestly, you don't want to know.

04:40.914 --> 04:43.280
-Honestly, I do.
-Why?

04:43.450 --> 04:45.782
What do you say we go with the idea
that I'm in charge,

04:45.885 --> 04:47.819
and I've asked a simple question?

04:49.823 --> 04:53.088
Nerus defines avarice and gluttony,
simple answer.

04:54.294 --> 04:58.594
He is a Goa'uld known
for his many appetites.

04:58.698 --> 05:00.290
He's also known as an inventor,

05:00.400 --> 05:02.095
responsible for a host
of Goa'uld technologies.

05:02.202 --> 05:05.603
Really? That's when I started
paying attention to him, too.

05:05.705 --> 05:09.937
Weird as it sounds,
he's offering to work for us.

05:13.179 --> 05:15.147
Nerus is not to be trusted.

05:15.882 --> 05:19.511
Funny, he had nice things to say
about you.

05:26.593 --> 05:28.493
No, he really did.
He said some very nice things.

05:28.595 --> 05:31.257
"l would consider it a great honor
to meet the heroes of the Tau'ri,

05:31.364 --> 05:33.127
"who brought the Goa'uld to their knees."

05:33.233 --> 05:36.202
-Yeah, that is nice.
-No, he's disgusting.

05:36.436 --> 05:39.496
You can't honestly open the doors
to a pathetic, minor Goa'uld

05:39.606 --> 05:41.597
posing as one of the big boys.

05:42.108 --> 05:44.906
Well, at least promise me
you're intending on torturing him.

05:45.011 --> 05:47.536
-We're setting him up in the VlP suite.
-No.

05:47.647 --> 05:49.615
-Yes.
-Sir, if you don't mind my asking...

05:49.716 --> 05:50.683
-Why?
-Yeah.

05:50.784 --> 05:51.978
Well, according to his communiqué,

05:52.085 --> 05:55.111
he's in possession of military
intelligence of the "utmost urgency."

05:55.221 --> 05:58.486
-Sounded like it was worth a listen.
-Still, why throw in with us?

05:58.591 --> 06:00.684
Why not stay with Ba'al
or work for some other Goa'uld?

06:00.794 --> 06:02.694
Well, look at it in terms of optics.

06:02.796 --> 06:04.787
We must look like major players now.

06:04.898 --> 06:06.331
TEAL'C: By defeating Anubis.

06:06.433 --> 06:08.162
Most of the System Lords were killed
by the Replicators,

06:08.268 --> 06:10.463
then we defeated the Replicators.

06:10.603 --> 06:13.197
-Wow, we look cool.
-Don't let it go to your head.

06:14.174 --> 06:16.472
(CHUCKLES) Have you seen his list
of dietary requirements?

06:16.609 --> 06:18.236
LANDRY: Already taken care of.

06:18.645 --> 06:20.704
"Ripened Traqeel eggs?"

06:20.947 --> 06:23.916
We've got eggs.
I don't know if they're ripe or not.

06:24.017 --> 06:28.613
SG-3 is with him on a neutral planet
doing a security check as we speak.

06:28.788 --> 06:31.586
As soon as they give the green light,
I want you to...

06:31.691 --> 06:33.682
HARRIMAN ON RADIO: Offworld activation.

06:34.327 --> 06:36.056
Speak of the devil.

06:46.539 --> 06:47.631
(STATIC BUZZING)

06:51.644 --> 06:53.305
-He's clean, sir.
-Thank you, Sergeant.

06:53.413 --> 06:54.812
We'll take it from here.

06:55.248 --> 06:58.740
-I am Nerus.
-Major General Hank Landry.

06:58.852 --> 07:00.285
I'm in command of Stargate...

07:00.420 --> 07:03.389
Yes, I'm sure you're a very important
person, and you had important reasons

07:03.490 --> 07:05.720
to subject me
to your security precautions,

07:05.825 --> 07:07.952
but to meet you,

07:08.495 --> 07:10.895
to look upon the face of the one.

07:12.465 --> 07:14.262
-The one what?
-The one who inspired

07:14.367 --> 07:15.994
the great uprising, of course.

07:16.436 --> 07:18.904
Oh, the time of false gods is at an end

07:19.005 --> 07:22.236
in no small part because of this man,

07:22.842 --> 07:25.834
Dr. Daniel Jackson.

07:25.945 --> 07:29.073
It is rumored among the Goa'uld

07:29.215 --> 07:32.412
that you alone defeated Anubis.
Is that true?

07:33.419 --> 07:36.013
-Where did you hear that?
-Oh, I hear everything.

07:39.325 --> 07:42.692
Lieutenant Colonel Cameron Mitchell,
leader of SG-1.

07:42.996 --> 07:45.089
-But you're not...?
-No.

07:46.332 --> 07:48.425
-Will he be here?
-Nope.

07:52.038 --> 07:56.065
(STAMMERING) And you're not even
Colonel Carter, are you?

07:57.944 --> 08:00.538
This isn't at all the way
I imagined it would be.

08:00.647 --> 08:03.138
Nerus, if you'd follow me
to our briefing room,

08:03.249 --> 08:04.477
we have much to discuss.

08:04.584 --> 08:06.848
Yes, yes, but first, I must have sustenance.

08:06.953 --> 08:08.853
Have you met
all my dietary requirements?

08:08.955 --> 08:10.445
As much as humanly possible.

08:10.557 --> 08:13.355
Good, good,
because I'm positively famished.

08:42.021 --> 08:43.613
No seeds!

08:44.090 --> 08:45.648
How is that possible?

08:45.758 --> 08:48.249
It's a state secret,
but we're willing to negotiate.

08:48.361 --> 08:52.297
That's impossible, but delicious.

08:55.702 --> 08:56.760
(CLEARING THROAT)

08:56.869 --> 08:58.200
Still...

08:59.505 --> 09:02.133
Still, we have important matters
to discuss, don't we?

09:02.475 --> 09:04.909
Your voice just changed.

09:05.011 --> 09:07.138
Oh, we don't have to talk that way.

09:07.247 --> 09:08.407
(LAUGHING)

09:09.582 --> 09:14.542
This is a device that I invented.

09:14.821 --> 09:19.485
What you're about to see
occurred nearly two days ago.

09:21.928 --> 09:25.420
Now, the free Jaffa, who claim this planet,
call it Kallana.

09:25.565 --> 09:27.226
What was that?

09:27.867 --> 09:31.826
The formation of an extremely large
force field around the planet's stargate.

09:32.205 --> 09:33.172
Brilliant.

09:33.273 --> 09:37.004
And you're sharing this information
with us, because...

09:37.110 --> 09:38.372
Why are you so surprised?

09:38.478 --> 09:40.969
We joined forces
to destroy the Replicators.

09:41.114 --> 09:43.776
I have no recollection
of your participation.

09:43.883 --> 09:46.579
Teal'c, you wound me.

09:46.719 --> 09:48.584
I was the one who figured out

09:48.688 --> 09:51.316
how to activate all the stargates
in the galaxy at once.

09:53.993 --> 09:56.791
Didn't Ba'al mention that to you?

09:57.930 --> 09:59.557
That is so like him.

10:00.533 --> 10:02.831
Isn't it, though? That's all right.

10:04.570 --> 10:08.597
Your adversaries call themselves the Ori.

10:08.708 --> 10:10.608
We know all about the Ori.

10:10.710 --> 10:14.510
Yes, well, thus far I detect
only a single individual

10:15.014 --> 10:17.642
no doubt a Prior, inside the force field,

10:20.119 --> 10:22.087
but it is expanding.

10:22.255 --> 10:25.224
Then it will soon be able
to accommodate entire armies.

10:25.325 --> 10:29.227
Yes, and furthermore, the stargate itself
has not shut down since it opened.

10:29.329 --> 10:30.819
Wait a minute,
you say this happened two days ago?

10:30.930 --> 10:31.919
Yes.

10:32.031 --> 10:33.555
Thirty-eight minutes is the maximum time

10:33.666 --> 10:36.328
a stargate can stay open.
That's a law of wormhole physics.

10:37.003 --> 10:38.300
Not according to the Ori.

10:38.438 --> 10:39.564
JACKSON: Which means they have
a power source

10:39.672 --> 10:41.833
which can indefinitely maintain
a wormhole from another galaxy,

10:41.941 --> 10:44.808
plus this force field.
A ZPM can't even do that.

10:45.144 --> 10:47.874
How are we to do battle
with an enemy so powerful?

10:50.917 --> 10:52.350
With my help.

10:53.886 --> 10:58.619
Every force field has a weakness,
and I'm confident that I shall find it.

11:02.161 --> 11:05.460
Sir, if this intel is correct,
it represents a complete change of tactics.

11:05.565 --> 11:07.897
-We'll have to respond.
-I agree, Colonel.

11:08.000 --> 11:12.937
But if this Kallana is a Jaffa world,
I'm not sure how this is our fight.

11:13.806 --> 11:15.774
Not your fight?

11:17.877 --> 11:21.244
You engineered the downfall
of the Goa'uld.

11:22.215 --> 11:26.549
This is very much a galaxy
of your own making, General.

11:27.186 --> 11:29.381
And you must take responsibility.

11:29.789 --> 11:31.256
What would you have us do?

11:31.591 --> 11:32.956
Attack them as quickly as possible

11:33.059 --> 11:36.222
with as much force
as you can bring to bear.

11:40.400 --> 11:43.130
This is nothing short
of an invasion, General.

11:43.770 --> 11:46.364
Like it or not, you're in a state of war.

11:53.713 --> 11:54.975
LANDRY: Jack, Jack.

11:55.081 --> 11:57.311
Jack, she practically invented
the Mark lX,

11:57.417 --> 11:59.885
and you're the one who thinks
we should use the damn thing.

11:59.986 --> 12:03.683
Why are you wasting
valuable time saying no?

12:05.158 --> 12:09.117
I've read enough of your SG-1 mission
reports to know there were times

12:09.228 --> 12:12.994
when no one else but Samantha Carter
could have pulled your ass out of the fire.

12:13.132 --> 12:15.293
Well, this is one of those...

12:16.135 --> 12:17.898
Reporting as ordered, sir.

12:19.071 --> 12:22.268
Yeah, she's standing right here.

12:23.476 --> 12:27.105
You're a funny man, Jack. Very funny.

12:35.755 --> 12:38.417
-HARRlMAN: Chevron four encoded.
-I promise you, he's lying.

12:38.524 --> 12:40.355
-About which part?
-All of it.

12:40.693 --> 12:41.660
Chevron five encoded.

12:41.761 --> 12:44.355
Yeah, but we have been unable
to dial the coordinates to Kallana,

12:44.464 --> 12:45.658
despite several attempts.

12:45.765 --> 12:48.928
Goa'uld don't do anything for anyone
other than themselves.

12:49.035 --> 12:50.093
HARRlMAN: Chevron six encoded.

12:50.203 --> 12:52.603
Maybe it's in his own interest
to stop the Ori.

12:54.507 --> 12:56.998
Chevron seven still will not lock.

12:57.276 --> 12:59.107
LANDRY: All right, we've tried that
long enough.

12:59.212 --> 13:00.338
Colonel Carter?

13:00.446 --> 13:03.506
We've revised the original plan
slightly to expedite matters.

13:03.616 --> 13:07.677
The Prometheus is en route
and will rendezvous with us at P4C-452.

13:07.954 --> 13:09.854
We'll proceed to Kallana from there.

13:09.989 --> 13:13.550
Now considering their unique ability
to maintain an active stargate indefinitely,

13:13.659 --> 13:17.151
and their force field capabilities,
the President has authorized

13:17.263 --> 13:19.493
any and all means
to complete the mission.

13:19.599 --> 13:21.066
Oh, boy.

13:21.234 --> 13:23.702
Here I was
trying to have a nuke-free career.

13:24.036 --> 13:26.095
We've been developing something
at Area 51

13:26.205 --> 13:28.036
that General O'Neill believes
will be our best chance

13:28.140 --> 13:30.199
to stop them right here, right now.

13:30.309 --> 13:31.867
But you don't agree.

13:32.545 --> 13:35.810
I agree we have to try.
I just don't think it'll be enough.

13:35.915 --> 13:38.406
It's what we've got. Questions?

13:40.419 --> 13:43.582
-No, sir.
-Still no response from the Jaffa Council?

13:43.689 --> 13:44.815
None as of yet.

13:44.924 --> 13:47.449
Well, we can't wait for Gerak.
We proceed as planned.

13:47.560 --> 13:48.925
-Chief, dial the gate.
-Yes, sir.

13:49.028 --> 13:50.256
Move out.

14:07.313 --> 14:09.941
Well, temporary or not,
it's good to have you back.

14:11.484 --> 14:14.419
How good is this?
Got the band back together.

14:15.154 --> 14:18.419
-So what's with the extra backup singer?
-Oh, she's good fun.

14:18.524 --> 14:21.322
-Plus, we figured if Jackson were to...
-Die.

14:21.427 --> 14:24.362
Yeah, that's the word.
It would jeopardize the mission.

14:25.598 --> 14:26.758
When we spoke a couple of weeks ago,

14:26.866 --> 14:29.232
you said you thought
the effect of the bracelets was wearing off.

14:29.335 --> 14:33.135
It was. I just didn't wanna put it to a test
from the other side of the galaxy, so...

14:33.239 --> 14:35.935
Wow, you're just dying
to get rid of me now, aren't you?

14:36.042 --> 14:38.977
-No. Not "dying to."
-Oh, no, I know I'm not welcome here,

14:39.078 --> 14:42.536
despite all my efforts to try and fit in
to your little stargating club.

14:42.648 --> 14:45.947
You can all rest assured that as soon
as I can safely part Daniel's company,

14:46.052 --> 14:49.453
without killing the both of us, I will.

14:52.558 --> 14:55.425
Oh, and you.

14:55.928 --> 14:57.020
You'll wish you'd listened to me

14:57.129 --> 15:00.189
when I said letting the Goa'uld come here
was a mistake.

15:09.475 --> 15:12.035
Get to it, and good Iuck.

15:13.479 --> 15:15.379
All right, let's do this.

15:28.094 --> 15:29.994
Request permission to come aboard.

15:30.096 --> 15:32.223
Shaft, welcome back to the Prometheus.

15:32.331 --> 15:33.764
Thank you, Colonel.

15:34.033 --> 15:36.297
-Shaft?
-My call sign.

15:36.636 --> 15:38.365
Cam, Shaft.

15:38.871 --> 15:40.862
-Oh.
-Yeah, disappointing, isn't it?

15:40.973 --> 15:43.874
Flight deck, this is Pendergast.
SG-1 is aboard.

15:43.976 --> 15:46.740
Engage hyperdrive and proceed to Kallana,
best possible speed.

15:46.846 --> 15:49.747
-CARTER: Is the Mark lX ready to go?
-Standing by for your systems check.

15:49.849 --> 15:52.477
-I hear you're in a hurry.
-You heard correctly.

15:54.654 --> 15:56.713
What is a Mark lX, exactly?

15:56.989 --> 16:00.447
-It's also known as a gate buster.
-Sounds big.

16:00.559 --> 16:02.959
-Some might say too big.
-Really?

16:03.062 --> 16:04.324
I've always thought there's no such thing.

16:04.430 --> 16:07.490
-Vala, this is a military vessel.
-I know, darling, I've stolen it before.

16:07.600 --> 16:09.625
-Well, just try to be...
-My charming self?

16:09.735 --> 16:12.863
Just a little less talk,
a little more "shut the hell up."

16:41.400 --> 16:44.426
(LAUGHING) General!
Join me for a glass of wine.

16:44.870 --> 16:47.839
-It's from a place called France.
-I'm on duty.

16:49.175 --> 16:50.540
What is this?

16:51.010 --> 16:53.911
This is exquisite. What is it?

16:54.013 --> 16:55.037
Chicken.

16:55.748 --> 16:58.876
-Chicken?
-It's a rare delicacy among our people.

16:59.618 --> 17:02.849
It's exquisite. I want more chicken.
More chicken!

17:02.955 --> 17:04.684
I'll try to pull some strings.

17:04.790 --> 17:07.520
Nerus, this arrangement
is only going to work

17:07.626 --> 17:10.356
if you actually do something
to help with this problem.

17:10.463 --> 17:13.899
I was working.
I was deep in thought when you walked in.

17:13.999 --> 17:15.591
Yeah, I can see that.

17:16.102 --> 17:19.333
-You don't trust me.
-Of course I don't trust you.

17:19.672 --> 17:22.903
Now, here is the latest transmission
from my satellite.

17:23.275 --> 17:28.406
As you can see, the force field
continues to expand in phases,

17:29.381 --> 17:32.714
and as it does so, it weakens considerably.

17:32.818 --> 17:35.150
Enough to penetrate
with our beaming technology?

17:35.254 --> 17:39.554
Yes, with those nuclear devices
that you were talking about.

17:39.658 --> 17:44.493
Or SG-1.
They could talk to this Prior face to face.

17:44.597 --> 17:49.091
-Why would they do that?
-We resort to force only when necessary.

17:49.268 --> 17:52.135
Oh, I assure you, it will be.
It will be, General.

17:52.471 --> 17:56.271
And with the most powerful weapons
in your arsenal.

17:57.109 --> 18:00.078
I'll forward this new information
directly to Prometheus,

18:00.179 --> 18:04.240
and I'll see
if I can arrange for more chicken.

18:05.384 --> 18:06.749
Do!

18:17.596 --> 18:20.064
Sir, we received an encrypted data burst
from Stargate Command

18:20.166 --> 18:21.690
the moment we came out of hyperspace.

18:21.801 --> 18:24.770
Decode it immediately. We picking up
any other vessels in the system?

18:24.870 --> 18:27.270
-Negative, sir.
-Can we get a closer look at the surface?

18:27.373 --> 18:30.774
You can already see the extent
of the incursion with the naked eye.

18:35.281 --> 18:37.442
My God, it's enormous.

18:39.552 --> 18:42.919
-Not everything I say is innuendo.
-We can all see, thank you.

18:43.022 --> 18:43.989
It's increased by almost 900%
since our original intel.

18:43.989 --> 18:46.787
It's increased by almost 900%
since our original intel.

18:46.892 --> 18:49.224
What of the Jaffa, Colonel Carter?

18:49.662 --> 18:50.924
(BEEPING)

18:52.231 --> 18:55.962
Sorry, Teal'c. I'm not detecting
any life signs outside of the force field.

18:57.469 --> 18:59.664
-lnside?
-Just one.

19:00.573 --> 19:02.837
-Prior.
-I don't know how he's managing it.

19:03.075 --> 19:05.407
According to these readings,
the atmosphere inside the field

19:05.511 --> 19:06.739
has become toxic.

19:06.879 --> 19:09.677
Probably as a result
of the Jaffa weapons fire on the force field.

19:09.782 --> 19:12.808
Send a subspace message
to Stargate Command.

19:14.086 --> 19:16.554
We are over the enemy beachhead.

19:20.893 --> 19:22.087
(CHANTING)

19:35.541 --> 19:37.668
JACKSON: You do realize that no matter
how nicely we ask them,

19:37.776 --> 19:39.505
they're not all that likely to stop?

19:39.778 --> 19:41.473
Then why are we going down there?

19:41.647 --> 19:43.137
Well, you're going 'cause I'm going.

19:43.249 --> 19:45.547
And we're going because we have orders.

19:45.651 --> 19:48.211
Thanks to Nerus.
Doesn't that alarm anyone?

19:48.354 --> 19:50.948
Well, our government believes
we need to send the Ori a message.

19:51.056 --> 19:54.685
Indeed. The Ori need to be made
aware that they are not welcome.

19:54.793 --> 19:57.523
Well, some of you are certainly expert
at getting that message across.

19:58.564 --> 20:00.225
PENDERGAST ON INTERCOM: SG-1,
this is the flight deck.

20:00.332 --> 20:02.163
My people are predicting
an expansion phase

20:02.268 --> 20:04.099
to occur any time in the next few minutes.

20:04.203 --> 20:05.898
CARTER: Understood.

20:07.339 --> 20:09.068
If Nerus is correct,
we should be able to punch through

20:09.174 --> 20:10.436
with our transport beam.

20:10.776 --> 20:11.868
And if not?

20:11.977 --> 20:13.877
Then we're all dressed up
with nowhere to go.

20:14.146 --> 20:18.082
CARTER: Your return window will be
roughly 16 seconds once on the surface.

20:18.183 --> 20:20.947
After which time you'll be committed
until the next expansion phase

20:21.053 --> 20:22.418
in about half an hour.

20:22.521 --> 20:25.012
-I'll be monitoring from the bridge.
-Thanks.

20:25.224 --> 20:26.816
Let's do this.

20:28.427 --> 20:33.387
Standby mode in three, two, one, mark.

20:34.333 --> 20:35.766
Good luck.

20:54.253 --> 20:57.086
Set. Weapon is now in mode two.

20:59.658 --> 21:01.785
We are go till the next window.

21:07.333 --> 21:09.062
JA CKSON: How can he breathe?

21:09.234 --> 21:11.794
Perhaps he has a personal shield
of some kind.

21:11.971 --> 21:13.233
(CHANTING)

21:22.348 --> 21:23.474
Yo!

21:24.583 --> 21:28.212
-My name is Lieutenant Colonel...
-I know who you are.

21:28.487 --> 21:30.478
Yeah, he just told you his name.

21:30.756 --> 21:34.089
I also know you will do everything
in your power to stop us.

21:34.693 --> 21:37.560
-Obvious.
-You will fail.

21:38.030 --> 21:41.693
-The Ori are more powerful than you...
-BIah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

21:41.800 --> 21:43.631
Here's the thing.
We're not here to talk to you.

21:43.736 --> 21:45.829
We wanna talk to the guys
you take orders from.

21:45.938 --> 21:49.203
-The Ori are all-seeing.
-MITCHELL: Great.

21:49.942 --> 21:53.241
In that case, we have in our possession
a Mark IX naqahdriah

21:53.345 --> 21:56.109
enhanced nuclear warhead,
which was designed solely

21:56.215 --> 22:00.914
for the purpose of vaporizing stargates
and anything else in a 100-mile radius.

22:01.020 --> 22:05.116
If you attempt to disable this warhead,
physically, electronically or otherwise,

22:05.224 --> 22:08.091
it will result in an immediate detonation.

22:08.427 --> 22:11.658
Now, we ha ve a number of these
god-awful things at our disposal,

22:11.764 --> 22:14.756
and we will not hesitate
to use them if necessary.

22:14.967 --> 22:17.128
If you do not disengage the stargate

22:17.236 --> 22:20.672
within 30 of our "Earth minutes, "

22:21.640 --> 22:24.108
we will shut down the gate for you.

22:25.744 --> 22:26.870
Go ahead.

22:30.482 --> 22:32.177
We know who and what you are,

22:32.284 --> 22:34.650
and want no part
of what you ha ve to offer.

22:35.054 --> 22:37.579
If you attempt this
on any other planet in this galaxy,

22:37.689 --> 22:40.522
we will find you and we will fight you.

22:42.694 --> 22:43.888
That's it?

22:46.598 --> 22:48.930
I just ga ve them 30 minutes.

23:00.679 --> 23:01.771
(BEEPING)

23:05.217 --> 23:07.151
Twenty-nine minutes.

23:10.489 --> 23:12.821
-Earth minutes.
-Yeah, I always wanted to say that.

23:13.025 --> 23:14.822
Well, now you ha ve.

23:17.029 --> 23:18.155
(CHANTING)

23:19.665 --> 23:23.066
Sure hope they shut down that gate
before we have to set this thing off.

23:23.168 --> 23:26.001
TEAL 'C: That would appear to be highly
unlikely, Colonel Mitchell.

23:26.105 --> 23:28.539
VALA: I know. It's naive, even for you.

23:28.640 --> 23:31.074
MITCHELL: Detonating the Iargest warhead
ever built by man

23:31.176 --> 23:34.339
is not exactly the historical footnote
that I had in mind.

23:34.446 --> 23:38.542
Not to mention the guilt you're gonna feel
for vaporizing a perfectly good stargate.

23:39.051 --> 23:42.384
-And that guy.
-Oh, he 's probably Iooking forward to it.

23:43.455 --> 23:45.150
Hey, Prior,

23:45.891 --> 23:49.224
do you understand
that you 're within a 100-mile radius,

23:49.428 --> 23:51.726
and that personal shield
ain 't gonna help you?

23:51.864 --> 23:54.560
Death is only the beginning
of the real journey.

23:54.666 --> 23:58.625
-Sounds familiar.
-lt should sound familiar, Dr. Jackson.

23:59.238 --> 24:01.536
When I die, I will ascend.

24:02.007 --> 24:04.305
It is the promise of the Ori.

24:04.409 --> 24:06.570
Even if you fail your task?

24:07.112 --> 24:08.170
(RUMBLING)

24:09.882 --> 24:11.645
What the hell is that?

24:17.689 --> 24:19.213
-PENDERGAST: Lieutenant?
-MARKS: There was no warning, sir.

24:19.324 --> 24:21.485
They started firing
the second they came out of hyperspace.

24:21.593 --> 24:24.323
Damn fortunate they're not firing at us.
Open communications.

24:24.429 --> 24:27.523
To Jaffa vessels,
this is the Earth ship Prometheus.

24:27.633 --> 24:31.262
We request that you hold your fire.
We have people down there.

24:35.007 --> 24:39.808
I repeat. SG-1 is on the planet attempting
to negotiate an Ori withdrawal.

24:40.646 --> 24:42.443
Cease fire now!

24:47.653 --> 24:50.281
The force field is being fired upon
by Ha 'tak vessels.

24:50.389 --> 24:53.483
-Why are they doing that?
-Could we get them to stop doing that?

24:53.592 --> 24:55.560
MITCHELL: Oh, this could be bad.

24:55.661 --> 24:59.097
The Mark IX's fuse in mode two
is a wee bit twitchy.

24:59.198 --> 25:02.031
- You mean it could go off?
- Yeah.

25:06.872 --> 25:08.533
They stopped firing.

25:11.443 --> 25:13.775
Sir, the force field is entering
an expansion phase

25:13.879 --> 25:15.506
ahead of the predicted time.

25:15.614 --> 25:18.048
This is Pendergast.
I want SG-1 brought back aboard

25:18.150 --> 25:20.243
as soon as we can beam them
through the force field.

25:20.385 --> 25:23.650
PENDERGAST ON RADIO: SG-1,
prepare for immediate extraction.

25:29.695 --> 25:32.061
MITCHELL: The weapon is now in
mode one.

25:33.599 --> 25:36.124
Prometheus, we are ready for beam up.

25:37.336 --> 25:39.827
Prior, Iast chance.

25:59.725 --> 26:02.193
I am Gerak of the free Jaffa.

26:02.995 --> 26:04.724
Why have you come here?

26:07.132 --> 26:09.066
It's an honor to speak with you, sir.

26:09.234 --> 26:11.202
My name
is Lieutenant Colonel Samantha Carter.

26:11.303 --> 26:14.033
By insisting that we cease fire
on the enemy stronghold,

26:14.139 --> 26:18.974
you've allowed it to expand even further,
and we've lost the element of surprise.

26:19.845 --> 26:22.541
And quite possibly saved the lives of SG-1.

26:22.648 --> 26:25.446
I ask you again,
why have you come to this world?

26:25.550 --> 26:29.042
We have reason to believe that
the Ori are attempting to use this planet

26:29.154 --> 26:31.213
to stage a full-scale invasion.

26:31.323 --> 26:34.315
And you hoped to repel this invasion
with words?

26:35.227 --> 26:36.694
There is more to this.

26:36.795 --> 26:39.889
Words are often
the most powerful weapon of all, Gerak.

26:39.998 --> 26:43.729
The old ways will not stop an adversary
as powerful as the Ori.

26:43.835 --> 26:47.236
So you said in your message
to the High Council, Teal'c.

26:47.339 --> 26:49.739
To which we received no response.

26:49.841 --> 26:52.639
We had no choice but to act
on the information we had.

26:52.744 --> 26:57.647
And how is it that the Tau'ri received
this information even before the Council?

26:58.483 --> 27:00.280
How we got this information
is not important.

27:00.385 --> 27:04.116
What is important that we stand together
as allies in the face of our common enemy.

27:24.042 --> 27:27.102
-You said you've come to fight.
-We have.

27:27.312 --> 27:31.510
I dispatched a scout
in a cloaked cargo ship.

27:34.019 --> 27:36.613
He tells me you have done nothing.

27:38.056 --> 27:39.318
We're sending the Ori a message,

27:39.424 --> 27:43.292
which they should receive
in about 10 seconds.

27:43.395 --> 27:45.158
Shields to maximum.

27:45.497 --> 27:48.057
Gerak, I suggest you give
the same order aboard your ships.

27:48.166 --> 27:51.397
-There will be a blast wave.
-Jaffa!

27:52.371 --> 27:53.702
Five seconds.

28:01.913 --> 28:03.107
(EXPLOSION)

28:18.663 --> 28:21.063
Sir, the force field went into another
expansion phase

28:21.166 --> 28:22.758
just as the bomb detonated.

28:23.802 --> 28:25.429
And it's a big one.

28:31.476 --> 28:32.966
What is happening?

28:38.049 --> 28:40.017
The force field continues to expand.

28:40.118 --> 28:42.109
-lt isn't supposed to be doing that, is it?
-JACKSON: No.

28:42.220 --> 28:43.517
-Why is it doing that?
-I don't know.

28:43.622 --> 28:45.055
-What are you gonna do about it?
-Shut up.

28:45.157 --> 28:48.126
That was a multi-gigaton detonation.
There's just no way.

28:48.226 --> 28:50.592
-Maybe the gate was destroyed.
-No.

28:50.729 --> 28:53.391
If the field is still expanding,
the gate still has to be active.

28:53.498 --> 28:56.558
The environment inside the field
has been turned into superheated plasma.

28:56.668 --> 28:59.136
It makes it impossible
to get a reliable reading.

29:02.073 --> 29:04.268
And this is your message to the Ori?

29:04.509 --> 29:05.999
Pithy, wasn't it?

29:06.578 --> 29:09.138
We've struck the enemy
with our most powerful weapon.

29:09.247 --> 29:10.908
And yet their force field grows.

29:11.016 --> 29:14.076
-That was not our intention.
-Their beachhead must be destroyed.

29:14.186 --> 29:17.212
If you are truly our ally,
you will join us in this attack.

29:17.322 --> 29:21.349
If you do not,
your ship will become our next target.

29:33.905 --> 29:35.839
The detonation did weaken the force field.

29:35.941 --> 29:38.102
Our combined weapons fire
might just finish the job.

29:38.210 --> 29:41.543
If it does not, we will soon
be engaged in battle with Gerak's forces.

29:42.314 --> 29:43.941
We just don't have enough information.

29:44.182 --> 29:46.207
Until I can explain
how they're keeping the gate open,

29:46.318 --> 29:48.912
or powering a force field this large...

29:49.688 --> 29:50.677
It's your call.

29:50.789 --> 29:52.689
I say we run away
and rethink the whole thing.

29:58.296 --> 30:00.321
Open up with everything we've got.

30:02.968 --> 30:05.402
Bring the main rail gun online
and commence firing.

30:05.504 --> 30:06.971
Launch missiles.

30:15.881 --> 30:17.178
(SIREN WAILING)

30:18.183 --> 30:20.014
PENDERGAST: Is the fire having any effect?

30:20.118 --> 30:21.847
The force field is definitely losing strength.

30:21.953 --> 30:24.421
But it's still expanding at a faster rate
than it's weakening.

30:24.523 --> 30:27.390
It's almost enveloped the entire planet.
What happens then?

30:29.060 --> 30:30.049
Damn it.

30:30.161 --> 30:31.526
-What?
-What?

30:31.630 --> 30:33.928
Colonel, we need to cease fire now.

30:34.366 --> 30:35.993
-Now!
-Do it.

30:36.668 --> 30:38.568
The greater the intensity
of our weapons fire,

30:38.670 --> 30:40.661
the greater and more frequent
their expansion phases.

30:40.772 --> 30:42.933
There is a direct correlation.

30:43.041 --> 30:46.340
They're using the energy of our own
weapons to build their beachhead.

30:46.444 --> 30:47.843
You mean they planned this?

30:47.979 --> 30:49.776
CARTER: There's no way to project
the necessary power

30:49.881 --> 30:53.476
through a stargate across galaxies.
So they designed a force field

30:53.585 --> 30:55.212
that could be powered
by our own weapons.

30:55.320 --> 30:57.754
The Ori knew the Jaffa of Kallana
would defend their home world

30:57.856 --> 30:59.084
and others would follow.

30:59.190 --> 31:00.680
And Nerus made certain we'd join in.

31:00.792 --> 31:02.987
Which means he's working for the Ori.

31:03.094 --> 31:05.927
The Mark lX gave them almost 70%
of the power they needed

31:06.031 --> 31:07.623
to envelope the entire planet.

31:07.766 --> 31:11.099
-Oh, yeah, we've been set up.
-What a complete shock.

31:13.338 --> 31:14.566
Won't say another word.

31:14.673 --> 31:17.836
-Gerak's forces must also cease fire.
-Open communications.

31:47.806 --> 31:51.173
We have reason to believe our weapons
may power the enemy force field.

31:51.276 --> 31:52.368
Impossible.

31:52.477 --> 31:54.536
CARTER: Well, that's what I thought,
but it's the only explanation.

31:54.646 --> 31:56.807
Gerak, they used both of us.

-One of them is on a collision course.
-CARTER: I can confirm that.

33:06.317 --> 33:09.946
I want to know
what you sent my people into.

33:10.055 --> 33:11.613
General, I've been expecting you.

33:11.723 --> 33:14.283
You know, these eggs,
they're not properly ripe.

33:14.392 --> 33:17.054
I asked you a question. Sergeant!

33:19.030 --> 33:21.828
They say all good meals come to an end.

33:23.902 --> 33:28.839
I assume, General, that by now
SG-1 has reported that the Ori,

33:29.407 --> 33:33.070
the closest thing to true gods
in the entire universe,

33:33.178 --> 33:36.147
have successfully established
a permanent foothold.

33:36.247 --> 33:37.680
What did you do?

33:37.782 --> 33:41.309
Oh, it's not what I did, General.

33:41.419 --> 33:46.083
What I have done pales in comparison
to your contribution.

33:46.391 --> 33:51.328
And by now, the force field has almost
entirely enveloped the planet,

33:52.030 --> 33:54.590
which makes them unstoppable.

33:56.201 --> 34:00.934

-We must withdraw.
-We, too, have suffered damage, Gerak.

34:19.824 --> 34:21.155
But the battle is not yet over.

Our sensors tell us that the planet
has begun to collapse.

We cannot tell you to what extent.

know that your actions will be watched.

CARTER: We've got the sensors back up,

34:51.122 --> 34:53.556
but we're gonna have to get closer
to the planet to find out.

34:53.658 --> 34:56.024
PENDERGAST: Right, bring us about.
Take us back into the system.

34:56.127 --> 34:59.858
Okay, I've got a fix on the planet.
Looks like Gerak was right.

35:00.231 --> 35:04.725
According to the sensors,
its diameter has decreased by 16%.

35:05.336 --> 35:07.566
Planets don't shrink in my experience.

35:12.277 --> 35:13.938
CARTER: Oh, there's something else.

35:17.816 --> 35:18.976
What is that?

35:19.984 --> 35:22.282
-A ship?
-CARTER: It's hard to say.

35:22.387 --> 35:24.321
Whatever it is, I think
it's composed of the objects

35:24.422 --> 35:26.447
that came through the stargate.

35:36.134 --> 35:38.500
-Doesn't that look an awful lot like a...
-Yeah, it does.

35:38.603 --> 35:40.332
In fact, I think that's just what it is.

35:40.438 --> 35:43.134
No, it can't be,
because I was gonna say stargate.

35:43.241 --> 35:46.642
Try supergate.
I estimate it's 300 to 400 meters across.

35:46.744 --> 35:48.905
Large enough for passage
of an entire armada.

35:51.282 --> 35:53.944
-It's incomplete. There's still time.
-Time?

35:54.052 --> 35:56.850
Time to do what? Everything
we've done has just made things worse.

35:56.955 --> 35:59.617
The planet's diameter
has now decreased by up to 50%.

35:59.724 --> 36:01.954
-And it's accelerating rapidly.
-CARTER: I think I know why.

36:02.060 --> 36:04.585
Only one thing in the universe
could power a gate that size.

36:04.696 --> 36:08.325
It's also the only thing that could allow
them to keep the gate open this long.

36:08.433 --> 36:10.958
-And there's one on the other end.
-A black hole.

36:11.069 --> 36:14.129
That's what the force field was for.
It wasn't meant to keep us out.

36:14.239 --> 36:17.436
It was designed to collapse the planet
into a micro-singularity.

36:17.542 --> 36:18.566
Why?

36:18.843 --> 36:22.711
This is how they can create a wormhole
that can span such a vast distance.

36:22.814 --> 36:24.111
And with a black hole at either end,

36:24.215 --> 36:25.910
they can maintain
an open wormhole indefinitely.

36:26.017 --> 36:29.214
-Fine, fine. How do we stop it?
-I have an idea. If we can...

36:29.320 --> 36:32.312
The next idea that anybody comes up
with has to be outside the box.

36:32.423 --> 36:35.324
Okay, the gate
is composed of individual units.

36:35.426 --> 36:39.260
There must be some sort of energy
linkage between them, like a chain.

36:39.364 --> 36:42.492
-Exactly, so we...
-So we need a big old set of bolt cutters.

36:42.600 --> 36:45.763

Get closer to the box.

is speeding up exponentially.

36:54.212 --> 36:56.373

is minutes away,

36:56.481 --> 36:58.415

-How did you find it?
-Good guess.

37:47.398 --> 37:50.231
When controls are set a certain way,
rings seek out the nearest set,

37:50.335 --> 37:54.032
which happened to be aboard
this cargo ship, cloaked or not.

from Colonel Carter.

in some sort of energy field,

of the last link.

there will be a powerful shock wave.
