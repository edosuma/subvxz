Negative.

with you in HVT.[Jason scoffs]

could come in handy.

11:22.551 --> 11:25.685

Just a shooter.[chuckles]

That's not how I want it.SONNY:
No, no, no, no.

It suits me fine, Jace.

the contingency cases.

Got it? Roll out at 1100.

putting general quarters

Principal Soto's just
returning everything

the Bravo rep that's
polishing his apples.

12:00.154 --> 12:01.982
That meeting every morning is
a time suck that I don't need.

12:02.025 --> 12:04.158
It's hard enough staying
connected with Stella.

12:04.201 --> 12:05.899
All right, well,
you just need to...

12:05.942 --> 12:08.510
tighten the reins there,
Blond Beauty.

You know, team

No point in burning
through it all

12:13.820 --> 12:15.169
while you're here.

12:17.519 --> 12:19.129
I'm probably gonna ignore
advice from someone

12:19.173 --> 12:20.957
who just stumbles blindly
into everything.

You got me there.

Blind, and you might as well
add deaf and dumb.

12:27.181 --> 12:30.532
Look, man, the, uh, reason
I was late to that meeting

12:30.575 --> 12:32.882
was, I got an email from
Hannah that she was having

12:32.926 --> 12:34.492
some sort of complications.

12:34.536 --> 12:36.494
She and the baby okay?

12:36.538 --> 12:37.800
Yeah, just no thanks to me.

12:37.844 --> 12:39.802
I was like a damn goat
on Astroturf.

12:39.846 --> 12:42.065
Just no sense of how
to help or comfort her.

12:42.109 --> 12:44.546
The email just got me
so twisted up, I-I...

12:44.589 --> 12:47.679
I blanked on the meeting
and I let Bravo down.

12:47.723 --> 12:49.725
Just a typical Sonny Quinn
soup sandwich.

12:49.769 --> 12:52.554
You could have just
explained all that to Soto.

12:52.597 --> 12:53.990
What, and make more
of a fool of myself?

that started the trash fire,

12:56.079 --> 12:57.559
and that was me
actually trying."

12:57.602 --> 12:58.908
So instead you just
let him think

12:58.952 --> 13:00.823
that you're a dumbass
knuckle-dragger.

13:00.867 --> 13:03.043
Seems pretty clear that's
what everyone already thinks.

13:03.086 --> 13:07.047

just stop fighting it.

Mm, nothing worth discussing.

Okay.

14:08.891 --> 14:10.588
The way you reacted to him,

14:10.632 --> 14:13.635
I'm just wondering
if he's doing to you

14:13.678 --> 14:15.376
what he did to me.

14:18.814 --> 14:19.902
When?

14:19.946 --> 14:22.905
I was fresh enlisted.

14:22.949 --> 14:24.080
He was an ensign.

14:24.124 --> 14:25.821
We had supply detail together.

14:25.865 --> 14:28.780
So at first I thought
he was funny.

14:28.824 --> 14:30.043
You know, charming even.

14:30.086 --> 14:33.089
But then he started
getting more aggressive.

14:33.133 --> 14:35.091
I'd be trying to work,

14:35.135 --> 14:37.920
and he'd be badgering me about
what kind of guy I liked,

14:37.964 --> 14:39.313
what I fantasized about.

14:40.923 --> 14:44.753
I tried to laugh it off,
but it only got uglier.

14:49.149 --> 14:50.802
And here I'd hoped
he'd changed.

14:50.846 --> 14:53.022
It's just talk.For now.

14:53.066 --> 14:54.937
Look, it's sexual harassment.

14:54.981 --> 14:56.808
Same as back then.

14:56.852 --> 14:59.986
And I wish that I had been
brave enough to report him.

Yeah, Atanga's presence in the

who's in there with them,

Atanga right now.

phone from the HVT's pocket.

You've been making people
uncomfortable.

34:43.168 --> 34:44.299
Uncomfortable?

Well, I know

34:46.084 --> 34:48.129
my sense of humor isn't for
everyone. If I said something...

perform to feel safe around you.
