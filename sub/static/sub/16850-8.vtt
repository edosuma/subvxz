00:43.611 --> 00:46.414
the human brain loses
all sense of decorum.

00:46.480 --> 00:49.083
It's hard to keep
tensions at bay.

00:49.150 --> 00:51.719
It's even harder to control
the body's more physical urges.

Hotter in here. You could
fry an egg on my boobs.

00:59.793 --> 01:01.529
Rain check, Dori.

01:01.595 --> 01:04.732

an interesting day.

scorcher today, huh?

01:12.005 --> 01:13.941
Why don't you leave me alone?

01:14.007 --> 01:15.776
I'm going ahead
with my cure for cancer.

01:15.843 --> 01:18.446
Understand, Glenn,
that we understand

01:18.512 --> 01:21.182
how hard it is for
you to understand, Glenn.

01:21.249 --> 01:23.184
You cured cancer.

01:23.251 --> 01:25.186
- That's...a big deal.
- The biggest.

01:25.253 --> 01:27.421
Only a handful of other doctors
have done it.

01:27.488 --> 01:29.590
- Well--
- I'm not gonna give that up.

01:34.828 --> 01:36.830
- Now, if you have the time.
- I do.

01:36.897 --> 01:40.100
I just wanna drop my bag, check
my e-mail. About five minutes?

01:40.168 --> 01:42.170
Yeah, that sounds good.

01:42.236 --> 01:46.039
(female #1)
In chemistry, the quickest way
to transform a substance

01:46.106 --> 01:48.676
is to apply extreme heat.

01:48.742 --> 01:50.744
But be careful,
apply too much

01:50.811 --> 01:53.947
and that substance
can explode all over you.

01:54.014 --> 01:56.217
Chief, can I talk to you
for a minute?

01:56.284 --> 01:57.951
Oh, talk to me.

You can anything
to me. Oh, it's hot.

I wanna talk to you about.

- You know I have a wife.
- Oh, yeah, Pam.

02:08.696 --> 02:10.631
- No, Karen.
- Yeah, love her.

02:10.698 --> 02:13.267
- I can't do this to my kids.
- Jason and Kylie.

02:13.334 --> 02:15.569
- Not even close.
- Who cares? Come on, big daddy.

02:15.636 --> 02:18.005
Just give me one kiss
and I'll say goodbye forever.

02:18.071 --> 02:21.475
- Just put it in there. Mmm.
- Not even a little. Not a peck.

- Damn heat, huh?
- No, no, it's not the heat.

It was just the thought
of doing rounds with you.

03:29.843 --> 03:31.245
Hey.

03:31.312 --> 03:34.214
Look, I'm just gonna say it.

03:34.282 --> 03:36.950
You look really hot.

03:37.017 --> 03:40.488
Thanks a lot. It's these scrubs.
They don't breathe at all.

03:40.554 --> 03:43.123
Tell me about it.
I mean, I am just like

03:43.190 --> 03:45.793
roasting in these things,
you know?

03:47.127 --> 03:49.530
Maybe you should think
about taking them off.

03:49.597 --> 03:51.765
- Yeah.
- Or are you scared..

03:51.832 --> 03:55.736

you for a ten-year-old boy?

04:20.327 --> 04:22.863

04:22.930 --> 04:24.665

- Oh.

04:24.732 --> 04:26.700
Why are you looking at
Blake like that?

04:26.767 --> 04:29.670
Something about the heat
is making me horny for him.

04:29.737 --> 04:31.138
I don't get it

04:31.204 --> 04:33.974
but this feeling isn't going
away until I jack my spoo.

04:34.041 --> 04:36.577
Thinking about you having sex
with Blake makes me

04:36.644 --> 04:38.412
think you oughta have sex
with me--

04:38.479 --> 04:40.781
- Shh. Where did he go?
- I don't know.

04:40.848 --> 04:44.051
He probably went to the closet
to cry like he usually does.

04:46.854 --> 04:48.789
Ahh. Oh.

04:48.856 --> 04:50.591
Valerie. Come on.

04:50.658 --> 04:54.194
It's too hot and cramped in here
for one person, let alone two.

04:54.261 --> 04:57.731
Oh, I'm sure you've crammed
yourself into tighter spaces.

04:58.832 --> 05:01.702
- Oh, you mean a clown car.
- No.

05:01.769 --> 05:04.137
That's a myth. There's
a trap door in the floor.

05:04.204 --> 05:07.174
There's never more than two
clowns in the car at once.

05:07.240 --> 05:10.844
Well then, here we are.
Just two clowns.

05:10.911 --> 05:12.980
Do you have
some clowning background?

05:13.046 --> 05:14.915
No. You want some?

05:14.982 --> 05:16.750
Do I...What?

05:16.817 --> 05:19.353
Lola doesn't deserve you.
She's archaic and redundant.

05:19.420 --> 05:22.723
You need someone
who's gonna respond to you.

05:22.790 --> 05:26.226
- Are you okay?
- I think I'm gonna faint.

05:26.293 --> 05:28.429
This is so hot. Oh.

05:29.997 --> 05:32.666
The heat makes people
do silly things.

It melts their
inhibitions like ice

05:35.536 --> 05:37.705

like soup.

05:40.273 --> 05:43.977
like soup in a mint julep.

05:44.044 --> 05:47.047
You listen to me. I'm not
willing to keep my cancer cure

05:47.114 --> 05:50.117
under wraps just because
the government tells me to.

05:50.183 --> 05:52.185
I'll call my congressman.

05:52.252 --> 05:55.122

Who do you think runs Congress?

05:57.224 --> 05:58.559

It's the big pharmaceutical
companies, Glenn

06:01.328 --> 06:03.330

kids how to read? Teachers?

06:11.405 --> 06:15.208

06:15.275 --> 06:17.678
Big Pharma took us
to war in Vietnam

06:17.745 --> 06:20.280
synthesized crack,
and killed Kennedy.

06:20.347 --> 06:23.183
Big Pharma came from outer space

06:23.250 --> 06:24.518
invented Ben Franklin

06:24.585 --> 06:28.622
started a little company
called the Internet.

06:28.689 --> 06:32.960

with high-fructose corn syrup.

But what about an unwatched pot
left boiling a long time?

07:30.551 --> 07:32.553
Does it get extra boiled?

are normal bullets.

- Ha-ha-ha.

wearing all that slutty make-up?

Drop the container.
Drop the gun. Drop the gun.
