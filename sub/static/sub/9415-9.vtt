After Shelley had put the light down...

14:24.622 --> 14:26.664
I got this feeling...

14:26.665 --> 14:29.851
Head down the coast, so
that would be really nice.

14:29.852 --> 14:32.612
[Distorted speech]

14:33.756 --> 14:36.331
I didn't know what it was.

14:36.332 --> 14:42.030
You could call it a hunter's instinct,
but I knew that there was danger.

14:42.031 --> 14:45.511
[Distorted music and speech]

14:53.509 --> 14:56.287
I felt it, and I felt it strong.

14:56.288 --> 14:58.746
We need to go in the house.

14:58.747 --> 15:01.906
And he grabbed me by my
shirt. He just kept saying...

15:01.907 --> 15:04.786
- We need to go in the house now.
- And I said, well, why?

15:04.787 --> 15:07.622
- I don't know. I don't know.
- Don't just grab me like that.

15:07.623 --> 15:10.292
- Come on, you got...
- What's got into you? What's the matter?

15:10.293 --> 15:12.573
I could tell that he had some fear,

15:12.574 --> 15:15.931
and he had no reason... he
had nothing to show me why.

15:15.932 --> 15:19.665
I just knew that I had to get Shelley
in the house, get her to safety.

15:19.666 --> 15:24.226
What's got into you?
[Underbrush rustling]

15:26.724 --> 15:29.444
And all of a sudden,
I could hear rustling.

15:29.445 --> 15:32.385
[Underbrush rustling]

15:32.715 --> 15:34.695
There.

15:42.103 --> 15:45.693
There was three sets of
eyes looking back at us.

15:45.694 --> 15:47.162
[Creatures growling]

15:47.163 --> 15:50.043
Fluorescent, almost.

15:50.766 --> 15:52.651
[Branch cracks]

15:52.652 --> 15:55.003
There was another one.

15:55.004 --> 15:59.663
I said, Shelley, look over
there. Shine the light.

15:59.664 --> 16:02.720
And there was another one.

16:02.721 --> 16:03.832
That made five.

16:03.833 --> 16:06.490
[Creatures snarling and growling]

16:06.491 --> 16:10.618
It appeared that they were
mad and wanted to come at us.

16:10.619 --> 16:13.255
[Creatures snarling and growling]

16:13.256 --> 16:16.024
Go. Go. Go. Go! Go! Go! Go!

16:16.025 --> 16:18.905
[Creatures snarling]

16:26.157 --> 16:27.837
_.

16:28.973 --> 16:31.853
[Creatures snarling]

16:33.878 --> 16:35.711
What are those things?

16:35.712 --> 16:38.621
- What... what the hell are they?
- I don't know.

16:38.622 --> 16:41.716
The first thing she does is put
the light against the screen.

16:41.717 --> 16:43.926
[Creatures snarling]

16:43.927 --> 16:48.131
So I had to take a hold of her
again and get her to move back away.

16:48.132 --> 16:50.020
But I wanted to look at them.

16:50.021 --> 16:51.916
Shelley, don't.

16:51.917 --> 16:55.980
I wanted this to make sense. I
wanted to know what I was looking at.

16:55.981 --> 16:59.976
It was surreal. It was like you
were having a dream, a nightmare.

16:59.977 --> 17:02.612
- I need my guns.
- Oh, don't start, Eric.

17:02.613 --> 17:07.017
That's why people
keep guns in the house.

17:07.018 --> 17:09.803
I had never seen anything
that looked like this.

17:09.804 --> 17:15.704
It was clearly not a bear, but
it was huge and dangerous-looking.

17:16.896 --> 17:20.430
- Well, what are we gonna do?
- I'm thinking.

17:20.431 --> 17:25.069
He felt very helpless because
he didn't have a weapon.

17:25.070 --> 17:27.911
I didn't know that we
were safe in the house.

17:27.912 --> 17:31.141
I know if I had those
guns, we'd be safer.

17:31.142 --> 17:32.710
I knew that.

17:32.711 --> 17:36.491
I'm gonna go check on Chelsea.

17:39.116 --> 17:40.929
I'm gonna get my guns.

17:40.930 --> 17:42.152
Forget about it.

17:42.153 --> 17:44.973
Don't go outside.

17:45.289 --> 17:46.903
Please, Eric.

17:46.904 --> 17:48.511
We didn't know what they were.

17:48.512 --> 17:51.476
We didn't know what
they were capable of.

17:51.477 --> 17:56.217
Why would either one
of us go back outside?

17:57.168 --> 18:01.188
So I said, okay, and she went up.

18:08.179 --> 18:12.079
My daughter was upstairs sleeping.

18:12.683 --> 18:14.723
[Gasps]

18:15.086 --> 18:20.986
I needed to make sure she was safe and that
we could see what was going on outside.

18:23.872 --> 18:25.895
[Whispering] Chelsea, wake up.

18:25.896 --> 18:29.411
I shook her and shook her and shook
her, and, of course, she was irritable...

18:29.412 --> 18:31.271
And, what? What? What?

18:31.272 --> 18:33.662
My mom was like, get up.
Get up. You have to see this.

18:33.663 --> 18:35.571
Come on, you have to see
what these things are.

18:35.572 --> 18:36.950
She almost looked troubled.

18:36.951 --> 18:42.851
She was anxious, just very anxious to
show me something out of the window.

18:46.984 --> 18:50.164
[Whispering] Down there.

18:51.536 --> 18:54.056
You see them?

18:54.291 --> 18:56.211
Cool.

18:57.428 --> 18:59.829
I mean, of course I was interested.

18:59.830 --> 19:03.582
I was... I was still sleeping, you know.
I mean, I was still half asleep, so...

19:03.583 --> 19:06.840
I didn't really make too much of it.

19:06.841 --> 19:09.417
Don't you think you want to stay up?

19:09.418 --> 19:13.292
And I'm like, let me know what
happens in the morning. [Laughs]

19:13.293 --> 19:17.373
And she laid back down in her bed.

19:17.648 --> 19:20.431
I'm not sure it really registered...

19:20.432 --> 19:24.392
Properly, what she was looking at.

19:31.362 --> 19:35.865
They were all still
there, all five of them.

19:35.866 --> 19:39.766
They were in a crouched position.

19:43.674 --> 19:49.574
Then one of 'em stood right up on their
hind feet and looked right up at me.

19:49.913 --> 19:52.182
They were massive.

19:52.183 --> 19:53.516
I was shocked.

19:53.517 --> 19:56.217
It was beyond...

19:56.353 --> 20:01.324
It was almost too much
for your brain to process.

20:01.325 --> 20:04.925
It was... it was astonishing.

20:07.322 --> 20:10.212
I was downstairs on my own.

20:10.213 --> 20:13.897
I had a bunch of things
going on in my head.

20:13.898 --> 20:16.647
Here we are in a dangerous situation.

20:16.648 --> 20:19.936
And I can't do what I'm supposed to do.

20:19.937 --> 20:23.597
And that's protect my family.

20:25.424 --> 20:27.499
I looked out the window,
and I could see that

20:27.500 --> 20:30.077
they were off a little
bit in the distance.

20:30.078 --> 20:33.798
And I thought, could we leave?

20:34.554 --> 20:39.312
If I could get in the vehicle, perhaps
I could get it backed up to the house.

20:39.313 --> 20:44.893
And I could get Shelley and
Chelsea out of harm's way.

20:50.481 --> 20:53.042
So I had to make a decision.

20:53.043 --> 20:55.083
[Sighs]

21:03.654 --> 21:07.390
I went around and tried
to shut all the windows.

21:07.391 --> 21:09.325
Did I worry if they were in the house?

21:09.326 --> 21:11.060
[Lock clicks]

21:11.061 --> 21:13.341
Absolutely.

21:16.048 --> 21:18.468
Jasper, Briggs.

21:18.469 --> 21:21.971
It started to dawn on me that
I hadn't heard the dogs bark.

21:21.972 --> 21:25.107
I hadn't seen the dogs.

21:25.108 --> 21:28.288
Something was going on.

21:39.156 --> 21:41.559
I got outside onto the porch,

21:41.560 --> 21:47.062
and from what I could see, some of
'em, they were down over the hill.

21:47.063 --> 21:52.963
And now I had 25, 30 feet to be able to
get in the car to back it up to the house.

22:04.080 --> 22:09.480
I wasn't able to go very
fast because of my injury.

22:10.421 --> 22:14.261
And I was scared, really scared.

22:17.628 --> 22:23.528
That 20 feet was gonna be the
longest 20 feet that I ever walked.

22:33.877 --> 22:35.778
[Whispering] Jasper.

22:35.779 --> 22:37.819
Briggs.

22:40.451 --> 22:44.520
I started going from room to
room, calling both dogs' names.

22:44.521 --> 22:48.541
Very strange for them not to come.

22:50.160 --> 22:51.761
[Whispering] Jasper.

22:51.762 --> 22:53.802
Briggs.

22:56.266 --> 22:58.966
[Soft fluttering]

23:10.841 --> 23:13.215
I felt the vibration.

23:13.216 --> 23:15.217
I heard the scurrying.

23:15.218 --> 23:17.702
[Soft scraping]

23:17.703 --> 23:20.890
I didn't know what the source was.

23:20.891 --> 23:23.471
[Door creaking]

23:36.940 --> 23:39.760
[Breathing heavily]

24:04.468 --> 24:06.553
[Dogs whimpering]

24:06.554 --> 24:08.771
These hunting dogs, they were hiding.

24:08.772 --> 24:11.541
They knew something was not
right, and they were scared.

24:11.542 --> 24:13.496
[Sighs]

24:13.497 --> 24:17.817
So that was a big concern for me too.

24:22.853 --> 24:25.588
I kept my eye right
on 'em all the time...

24:25.589 --> 24:27.780
[Grunting]

24:27.781 --> 24:30.884
Even though I was hurting pretty bad.

24:30.885 --> 24:33.105
[Grunting]

24:37.054 --> 24:39.634
[Keys jingling]

24:41.808 --> 24:45.926
I finally got on the
other side of the vehicles.

24:45.927 --> 24:48.219
And I was fumbling trying
to get into the door.

24:48.220 --> 24:50.800
[Keys jingling]

24:52.989 --> 24:54.909
Boom.

24:55.085 --> 24:56.061
[Grunts]

24:56.062 --> 24:57.625
What the hell?

24:57.626 --> 25:00.446
Everything lit up.

25:10.830 --> 25:13.830
I felt very exposed.

25:22.723 --> 25:24.403
_.

25:28.499 --> 25:30.179
_.

25:35.924 --> 25:37.821
I felt very exposed.

25:37.822 --> 25:40.543
It scared the [Bleep] out of me.

25:40.544 --> 25:43.480
And I... and I felt very vulnerable.

25:43.481 --> 25:45.701
[Grunting]

25:47.993 --> 25:50.873
[Creatures growling]

25:59.948 --> 26:01.248
[Creature roaring]

26:01.249 --> 26:03.320
[Gasping]

26:03.321 --> 26:05.686
All of a sudden,
there's one right there.

26:05.687 --> 26:09.407
[Creature growling and snarling]

26:10.220 --> 26:12.347
And I looked at him.

26:12.348 --> 26:15.108
He looked at me.

26:15.208 --> 26:19.244
I thought for sure he
was gonna come at me.

26:19.245 --> 26:22.065
[Creature growling]

26:23.416 --> 26:25.350
And then he kind of froze.

26:25.351 --> 26:28.171
[Creature growling]

26:29.456 --> 26:32.096
Then he bolted.

26:32.626 --> 26:34.326
[Grunting]

26:34.327 --> 26:37.496
I knew using the vehicle
wasn't gonna be an option.

26:37.497 --> 26:39.717
[Grunting]

26:39.967 --> 26:41.767
Ow!

26:47.485 --> 26:48.788
[Whispering] Eric.

26:48.789 --> 26:54.249
I had absolutely no idea
that Eric had gone outside...

26:57.168 --> 27:03.068
Did not feel safe, had absolutely
no idea where he was in the house.

27:05.291 --> 27:06.413
[Sighs]

27:06.414 --> 27:09.174
[Whispering] Eric.

27:10.463 --> 27:12.923
[Door creaks]

27:18.772 --> 27:20.673
You went outside?

27:20.674 --> 27:23.175
I remember telling
him how stupid it was.

27:23.176 --> 27:25.377
What were you thinking?

27:25.378 --> 27:27.146
I thought I could get to the truck.

27:27.147 --> 27:29.307
And I said, that isn't even the point.

27:29.308 --> 27:32.582
The point is, you shouldn't have
opened up the door in the first place,

27:32.583 --> 27:35.087
and we're in here, and if
something happens to you...

27:35.088 --> 27:36.989
What would I do then and Chelsea...

27:36.990 --> 27:39.570
We're screwed.

27:40.490 --> 27:42.711
I'm sorry.

27:42.712 --> 27:44.352
[Sighs]

27:44.353 --> 27:47.199
We talked about what
we were gonna do next.

27:47.200 --> 27:49.268
We... you know, we have to do something.

27:49.269 --> 27:50.856
These things are dangerous.

27:50.857 --> 27:52.096
Let's call 911...

27:52.097 --> 27:54.821
And let someone else drive in.

27:54.822 --> 27:56.742
Yeah.

27:57.941 --> 27:59.396
Police.

27:59.397 --> 28:02.219
It would've even sounded unreal to me.

28:02.220 --> 28:04.824
Hello, yes. [Sighs]

28:04.825 --> 28:07.511
There are some things
trying to get into our house.

28:07.512 --> 28:10.790
I had a feeling that the police
officer wouldn't take us serious.

28:10.791 --> 28:12.528
No, they're not bears.

28:12.529 --> 28:14.060
He asked me if it was a moose.

28:14.061 --> 28:15.164
No.

28:15.165 --> 28:17.152
He asked me if it was a dog.

28:17.153 --> 28:20.336
No, they're something else.
I don't know what they are.

28:20.337 --> 28:22.638
They're really, really
big. They're like...

28:22.639 --> 28:24.240
7 to 8 feet tall.

28:24.241 --> 28:26.115
No, you're not listening to me.

28:26.116 --> 28:26.936
[Scoffs]

28:26.937 --> 28:28.746
Well, what would you like us to do?

28:28.747 --> 28:32.968
And he said, make sure your windows
are closed, and lock your doors.

28:32.969 --> 28:37.589
These creatures can come through
my wall if they want to get in.

28:37.590 --> 28:38.682
[Sighs]

28:38.683 --> 28:41.258
No. You're not listening to me.

28:41.259 --> 28:44.713
The police officer, he was
thinking that we were mistaken,

28:44.714 --> 28:47.294
and that they were a harmless animal.

28:47.295 --> 28:50.150
Please, you have to
send someone out. Look...

28:50.151 --> 28:52.070
He couldn't have been more wrong.

28:52.071 --> 28:54.696
[Dial tone humming]

28:54.697 --> 28:56.677
Hello?

28:57.149 --> 28:59.129
Hello.

29:00.013 --> 29:02.533
[Line beeping]

29:05.284 --> 29:08.053
The minute the phone call
was disconnected, I knew.

29:08.054 --> 29:10.522
I knew that nobody
was gonna come help us.

29:10.523 --> 29:11.986
We were on our own now.

29:11.987 --> 29:17.887
Any plans that we made to protect
ourselves was gonna be our ideas.

29:19.314 --> 29:21.410
I could feel it, and Eric knew it too.

29:21.411 --> 29:24.666
We are literally hostages in this house.

29:24.667 --> 29:28.327
We cannot leave this property.

29:28.865 --> 29:33.545
I knew at this point
that Eric was scared.

29:33.696 --> 29:39.596
And if he was scared, there
was a good reason to be worried.

29:42.583 --> 29:48.483
Shelley had gone back upstairs,
and I was downstairs by myself.

29:52.128 --> 29:53.276
[Grunts]

29:53.277 --> 29:57.177
The whole situation just
really frustrated me.

29:57.178 --> 30:02.398
It just seemed to be a
nightmare that didn't end.

30:02.794 --> 30:07.967
Here we are in a situation where we don't
even have anything to protect ourselves.

30:07.968 --> 30:13.488
And... and I was extremely
frustrated, and I was upset.

30:15.952 --> 30:18.712
But then I uh...

30:24.374 --> 30:28.698
Then I realized these things
stay away from the light.

30:28.699 --> 30:32.230
I don't know if they can't be in it.
I don't know if it hurts their eyes.

30:32.231 --> 30:33.971
I don't know what the reason is.

30:33.972 --> 30:39.872
But all of a sudden, we've got
something that we can use if we need to.

30:39.940 --> 30:44.740
Maybe we can keep these
things away from us.

30:48.684 --> 30:51.230
So I made a decision that...

30:51.231 --> 30:54.245
Even though I was hurting pretty bad.

30:54.246 --> 30:58.875
I was gonna at least attempt
to get out to that barn.

30:58.876 --> 31:03.376
And see if I could get one of the guns.

31:11.974 --> 31:15.068
I felt it would be best to
keep this from Shelley because,

31:15.069 --> 31:19.468
I think that it would've been
more stressful to her to know.

31:19.469 --> 31:22.769
And I didn't want that.

31:24.315 --> 31:26.535
[Grunting]

31:28.002 --> 31:33.902
I knew that as soon as I got out there,
I would have to trip that garage light.

31:37.486 --> 31:38.765
[Grunting]

31:38.766 --> 31:40.668
Come on.

31:40.669 --> 31:44.480
I was walking very slowly. I was
in a lot of pain at that time.

31:44.481 --> 31:48.921
And I just wanted the light to come on.

31:55.651 --> 31:58.531
[Creatures growling]

32:00.417 --> 32:04.317
All the eyes were looking at me.

32:05.202 --> 32:08.029
Part of 'em were going off to my left.

32:08.030 --> 32:10.910
[Creatures growling]

32:11.094 --> 32:12.968
Part of 'em were going off to my right.

32:12.969 --> 32:15.849
[Creatures growling]

32:16.505 --> 32:21.245
And they looked like
they were gonna pounce.

32:27.854 --> 32:29.534
_.

32:31.361 --> 32:33.581
[Creatures growling]

32:33.582 --> 32:35.262
_.

32:39.650 --> 32:42.652
I realized that this is a hunting mode.

32:42.653 --> 32:46.539
This is a way they would
take down an animal.

32:46.540 --> 32:50.500
And I realized I was that animal.

32:50.594 --> 32:55.197
I knew at that point, I better get out of
there, and I better get out of there now.

32:55.198 --> 32:58.635
But there was a danger that
when I moved out of the sensor,

32:58.636 --> 33:01.590
that light would go out
and I'd lose my protection.

33:01.591 --> 33:07.289
So the amount of time I had to get
to the porch was very, very short.

33:07.290 --> 33:11.070
[Creatures growling and snarling]

33:20.410 --> 33:22.925
[Creatures growling]

33:22.926 --> 33:27.186
All of a sudden, I heard them coming.

33:30.367 --> 33:35.315
I'm thinking to myself... and I'm
not daring to speak. I'm thinking...

33:35.316 --> 33:38.207
Oh, my gosh. They're
right outside our house.

33:38.208 --> 33:40.788
[Door rattling]

33:41.578 --> 33:45.308
It wasn't that I thought that
these creatures could turn doorknobs

33:45.309 --> 33:48.784
so much as just bash through a door,
just push right through it, kick it.

33:48.785 --> 33:50.553
However they wanted to get in...

33:50.554 --> 33:52.287
[Whispering] Eric.

33:52.288 --> 33:56.008
They would get into the house.

34:10.974 --> 34:13.134
[Panting]

34:14.645 --> 34:17.380
His face had a mixture of...

34:17.382 --> 34:19.422
Fear...

34:20.159 --> 34:22.560
And anxiety.

34:23.987 --> 34:29.887
The hair was up on the back of his neck,
and he was trying to keep it together.

34:30.687 --> 34:33.295
But what do you do? What does anyone do?

34:33.295 --> 34:39.196
I don't think anyone can honestly answer
that until they're in that situation.

34:44.675 --> 34:47.975
Our options had run out.

34:48.078 --> 34:53.014
We weren't going to be
able to get in the truck.

34:53.016 --> 34:56.786
We weren't going to be able
to get the guns up in the barn.

34:56.786 --> 34:59.104
The police weren't coming.

34:59.105 --> 35:03.893
There wasn't anything
else that we could do.

35:03.894 --> 35:07.254
What are we going to do?

35:07.375 --> 35:11.036
I don't know of anything
that's any stronger bond

35:11.037 --> 35:15.023
than that of a dad
protecting his family.

35:15.024 --> 35:19.600
Protecting my wife, protecting
my daughter, Chels...

35:19.601 --> 35:23.063
Was my number one concern
during the whole night.

35:23.064 --> 35:27.624
And whatever I had to do, I would do it.

35:38.962 --> 35:43.045
I briskly went to Chelsea's
bedroom, and I said, look.

35:43.046 --> 35:48.206
You need to get up, and
you have to get up now.

35:49.751 --> 35:52.991
Chelsea, get that light.

35:53.930 --> 35:56.748
We felt like we needed
to lock ourselves in.

35:56.749 --> 35:58.080
Here, take this.

35:58.081 --> 36:02.265
And we definitely felt like we
were hostages in our own home.

36:02.266 --> 36:06.646
And that these creatures had us captive.

36:09.660 --> 36:12.494
Our only friend at that
point becomes daylight,

36:12.495 --> 36:16.635
hopefully, and that's not even 100%.

36:18.669 --> 36:20.335
But we didn't have a choice.

36:20.336 --> 36:24.159
I mean, we just laid
on top of our bed...

36:24.160 --> 36:28.000
And waited for daybreak to come.

36:28.592 --> 36:32.492
It's okay. We're gonna be fine.

36:43.760 --> 36:48.560
Then we just sat there
for the longest time.

36:52.049 --> 36:53.910
It was very quiet.

36:53.911 --> 36:58.771
And... and that itself
was sort of disturbing.

37:07.584 --> 37:09.384
[Creatures growling]

37:09.385 --> 37:11.725
And then...

37:11.922 --> 37:13.716
[Footsteps thudding]

37:13.717 --> 37:18.037
We could clearly hear something outside.

37:18.428 --> 37:20.768
[Loud thud]

37:22.742 --> 37:27.722
We realized they were
just outside of the wall.

37:30.149 --> 37:32.549
Oh, my God.

37:34.945 --> 37:38.760
And the only thing
between us and them...

37:38.761 --> 37:41.281
Was a window.

37:43.791 --> 37:46.491
I was petrified.

37:59.069 --> 38:00.369
And I could hear...

38:00.370 --> 38:02.470
[Growls]

38:03.377 --> 38:07.009
Like, a real guttural
low sound, a growl.

38:07.010 --> 38:09.011
[Creatures growling]

38:09.012 --> 38:13.315
When I squeezed her
hand, there was a tremble.

38:13.316 --> 38:15.486
She was very scared.

38:15.487 --> 38:16.952
It's okay.

38:16.953 --> 38:19.255
Everything's gonna be fine.

38:19.256 --> 38:22.497
I just tried to reassure her
that we were gonna be okay.

38:22.498 --> 38:26.962
And that Chelsea would be
okay and we'd get through this.

38:26.963 --> 38:30.458
But if I was being honest...

38:30.459 --> 38:35.370
There was definitely the thought
of that the end could come tonight.

38:35.371 --> 38:38.251
[Creatures growling]

38:58.510 --> 39:01.330
[Breathing heavily]

39:06.922 --> 39:09.562
[Birds chirping]

39:29.910 --> 39:32.730
[Creature growling]

39:37.033 --> 39:39.673
[Glass shatters]

39:46.990 --> 39:48.670
_.

39:52.462 --> 39:55.102
[Birds chirping]

39:55.875 --> 39:57.466
_.

39:57.467 --> 39:59.398
[Creature growling]

39:59.399 --> 40:00.784
[Glass shatters]

40:00.785 --> 40:03.063
[Gasps and screams]

40:03.064 --> 40:06.882
Calm down. Calm down. Calm
down. It's just a dream.

40:06.883 --> 40:10.148
It's just a dream. Calm down.

40:10.149 --> 40:12.246
Calm down. [Breathing heavily]

40:12.247 --> 40:16.324
It was such a relief when light came.

40:16.325 --> 40:17.919
It was... it was like...

40:17.920 --> 40:20.170
[Inhales and exhales sharply]

40:20.171 --> 40:26.071
Letting go of a breath that you've
been holding literally the entire night.

40:28.118 --> 40:30.758
They were gone.

40:36.455 --> 40:39.095
[Birds chirping]

40:43.734 --> 40:46.003
Sean knows that I wouldn't lie to him.

40:46.004 --> 40:49.146
He knows I wouldn't fabricate a story.

40:49.147 --> 40:51.674
And he heard the way I
was explaining it to him.

40:51.675 --> 40:54.344
He realized that I was upset.

40:54.345 --> 40:56.079
You all right?

40:56.080 --> 40:57.314
Hey, dad, hey.

40:57.315 --> 41:01.499
And he offered, you know, to come over.

41:01.500 --> 41:04.587
So we walked around and
started looking for tracks,

41:04.588 --> 41:08.000
looking for anything we could find...

41:08.001 --> 41:10.627
That we could tell
what these things were.

41:10.628 --> 41:14.031
And we found a number of tracks.

41:14.032 --> 41:17.192
Obviously they weren't
a four-legged creature.

41:17.193 --> 41:19.213
They... they didn't
have to be on four legs.

41:19.214 --> 41:22.339
These are huge claws.
Look at the size of that.

41:22.340 --> 41:27.380
They could stand right
up and walk on two feet.

41:29.197 --> 41:33.397
There was a lot of telltale evidence.

41:37.455 --> 41:41.324
Clearly they were hunting
in a methodical way.

41:41.325 --> 41:43.060
They were stalking.

41:43.061 --> 41:47.997
And then you're dealing with,
what just happened last night?

41:47.998 --> 41:50.172
What was that?

41:50.173 --> 41:52.469
I just hadn't seen anything like it.

41:52.470 --> 41:55.170
I have no idea.

41:56.307 --> 41:59.216
Several people reported
seeing mysterious lights

41:59.217 --> 42:02.196
that some say precede
creature sightings.

42:02.197 --> 42:05.584
A map of both locality's
overlaps almost exactly

42:05.585 --> 42:08.764
with hot spots of Manimal sightings.

42:08.765 --> 42:14.165
Can the folklore be true?
Do werewolf's really exist?

42:17.929 --> 42:22.849
I have no idea. I can't
answer that for you.

42:24.276 --> 42:26.916
I don't know what we saw.

42:26.917 --> 42:30.551
And if I was to say I'd be guessing.

42:30.552 --> 42:33.057
But it was huge.

42:33.058 --> 42:35.163
It was powerful.

42:35.164 --> 42:41.064
And there's no doubt in my mind, if it
had wanted to, it could have killed us.

42:41.775 --> 42:43.858
I wonder if we disturbed something,

42:43.859 --> 42:46.692
we touched something that
we weren't supposed to.

42:46.693 --> 42:50.086
Maybe we discovered something perhaps...

42:50.087 --> 42:53.567
Maybe they were warning us.

42:54.382 --> 42:56.129
Stay away.
