00:02.160 --> 00:03.650
Previously on The Vampire Diaries:

00:03.800 --> 00:06.724
You have the ability to keep living
inside someone else's body.

00:08.840 --> 00:11.047
- Talk to me. Did it work?
- Of course it worked.

00:11.280 --> 00:12.645
I'm Katherine Pierce.

00:12.800 --> 00:16.327
I'm Diane Freeman, head of campus security.
Your roommate took her own life.

00:16.480 --> 00:19.609
So tell me. Now that you've
slept with Klaus, how was it?

00:19.760 --> 00:21.330
Oh, my God.

00:21.920 --> 00:25.367
Katherine Pierce has permanent control
of Elena Gilbert's body.

00:25.520 --> 00:28.205
- We need to talk.
- You're the good.

00:28.360 --> 00:32.365
- And I need a little good in my life.
- I'm sorry, Damon. We're over.

00:32.680 --> 00:35.251
- We've been waiting for you.
- Does Elena know you're here?

00:35.400 --> 00:37.562
Elena thinks I'm a monster. She's right.

00:40.560 --> 00:43.291
Now that's the Damon Salvatore I remember.

00:51.560 --> 00:55.451
<i>Dear diary, I love my life.</i>

00:56.600 --> 00:58.045
<i>Seriously.</i>

00:58.240 --> 01:01.801
<i>Becoming Elena Gilbert is the best thing
that has ever happened to me.</i>

01:04.800 --> 01:07.610
<i>I finally have everything I ever wanted.</i>

01:08.320 --> 01:10.004
<i>I'm young.</i>

01:10.160 --> 01:11.730
<i>Healthy.</i>

01:12.320 --> 01:13.845
<i>Gorgeous.</i>

01:14.000 --> 01:15.923
<i>Everyone loves me.</i>

01:17.240 --> 01:19.766
<i>But best of all, I'm a vampire again.</i>

01:21.040 --> 01:23.008
<i>So rest in peace, Elena.</i>

01:23.160 --> 01:25.288
<i>Thanks for giving me your perfect life.</i>

01:25.480 --> 01:28.689
<i>And now that I've corrected the single
worst decision you ever made...</i>

01:28.840 --> 01:30.968
falling in love <i>with</i> Damon Salvatore...

01:31.120 --> 01:35.125
<i>I'm gonna win back the one thing
I've always wanted.</i>

01:48.000 --> 01:50.970
So we all agree. No more moping
about life's little failures.

01:51.120 --> 01:54.124
And no more dabbling in the dark arts
of boyfriends past.

01:54.280 --> 01:56.282
This is a fresh start.

01:56.440 --> 01:57.487
Couldn't agree more.

01:57.640 --> 01:59.722
I happen to love fresh starts.

01:59.880 --> 02:02.326
Um, I haven't been moping or dabbling.

02:02.480 --> 02:04.130
No one likes a bragger, Bonnie.

02:05.200 --> 02:06.725
Hey. Do you mind if I share...?

02:08.720 --> 02:10.643
Great. Thanks. Appreciate it.

02:10.800 --> 02:12.689
Today is the dawning of a new era.

02:12.880 --> 02:16.043
This is stage one in our metamorphosis
into the land of the brave...

02:16.200 --> 02:19.204
- ...the free and the single.
- Bonnie's not single.

02:19.400 --> 02:22.244
Bonnie's friends are single.
Which makes her single adjacent.

02:22.640 --> 02:25.689
So she can be our wingwoman.

02:25.880 --> 02:27.882
"Whitmore's Annual Bitter Ball.

02:28.080 --> 02:32.051
A night to celebrate broken hearts,
jilted lovers and bitter singles."

02:32.520 --> 02:34.363
This is our fresh start?

02:34.520 --> 02:36.841
No, this is our purge. Our cleanse.

02:37.000 --> 02:39.890
This is where we rid ourselves
from the baggage...

02:40.040 --> 02:43.601
better known as our tragic
and mortifying first semester.

02:43.760 --> 02:45.171
I'll drink to that.

02:45.320 --> 02:46.401
Bonnie.

02:50.480 --> 02:51.766
Bonnie, you in?

02:52.200 --> 02:53.929
Yeah. Yeah, that sounds like fun.

03:31.520 --> 03:34.444
Yeah. Hey.

03:34.600 --> 03:38.491
Sorry about the mess. I had some company
and things got a little out of hand.

03:38.800 --> 03:41.724
You wanna tell me what the hell's going on
out in the driveway?

03:41.880 --> 03:43.120
Ah.

03:43.480 --> 03:45.323
I let Enzo drive last night.

03:45.480 --> 03:47.130
He's a little out of practice.

03:47.280 --> 03:49.282
Almost ended up in the damn foyer. Heh.

03:49.440 --> 03:50.885
Huh.

03:51.680 --> 03:53.364
Oh.

03:53.520 --> 03:55.284
- You mean Aaron.
- Yeah.

03:55.480 --> 03:57.721
Yeah. Well, last night, we...

03:57.920 --> 04:00.287
We hunted him down,
and I ripped his throat out.

04:00.480 --> 04:02.960
You know, I figured it's time
to shove the last...

04:03.120 --> 04:06.283
branch of the Whitmore
family tree into the...

04:06.480 --> 04:07.527
wood chipper.

04:07.720 --> 04:10.087
So Elena breaks up with you...

04:10.240 --> 04:12.811
and your first instinct
is to go on a killing spree.

04:13.560 --> 04:15.403
Could you be any more predictable?

04:15.560 --> 04:18.803
It was my idea,
if it makes you feel any better.

04:20.040 --> 04:22.646
Enzo. Remember? We met when...

04:22.800 --> 04:25.371
You were trying to tear Damon's head off.
I remember.

04:25.520 --> 04:27.841
So, what, you guys are old pals again?

04:28.000 --> 04:30.446
- Murder buddies. Is that it?
- You know how it goes.

04:30.600 --> 04:32.921
I mean, I left him for
dead, he tried to kill me.

04:33.360 --> 04:34.441
We worked things out.

04:34.600 --> 04:38.525
When you spend five years with someone in a
dungeon, you have a pretty unbreakable...

04:38.680 --> 04:40.444
bond.

04:40.600 --> 04:44.127
Say, uh, you haven't heard
from Dr. Wes Maxfield by any chance?

04:44.280 --> 04:47.807
Bloke's next on the Augustine hit list,
and he's a slippery little devil.

04:47.960 --> 04:49.041
Is that the plan?

04:49.240 --> 04:53.325
Kill off Augustine, and then, uh, go back
to your sadistic, psychotic old self?

04:53.560 --> 04:55.847
I happen to like my old
sadistic self, Stefan.

04:56.040 --> 04:57.530
In fact, I miss that guy.

04:57.680 --> 05:01.890
That guy was dumb enough to try and
change himself to get a girl. Heh.

05:03.720 --> 05:06.724
So get another hobby, brother.
I'm not in the mood to be saved.

05:07.400 --> 05:08.731
What do you say?

05:08.960 --> 05:10.405
Should we get you a new hobby?

05:10.840 --> 05:12.285
Golf?

05:13.160 --> 05:14.207
Scrapbooking?

05:14.360 --> 05:16.567
- Scrapbooking.
- Come on, Damon.

05:16.960 --> 05:18.166
You're better than this.

05:18.320 --> 05:20.402
On the contrary, brother.

05:20.560 --> 05:23.245
I'm better like this.

05:32.040 --> 05:34.930
Hey, Stefan. Um, it's me.

05:35.080 --> 05:36.844
I was just, uh, wondering...

05:37.000 --> 05:40.561
I mean, I know things are kind of crazy,
and you're probably busy...

05:40.720 --> 05:42.722
but maybe you might wanna...

05:42.880 --> 05:46.248
come to campus and we can get a drink...

05:46.400 --> 05:49.768
- ...or, I don't know, talk. Heh.
- So you're trying to get back with Stefan?

05:49.920 --> 05:52.491
I didn't ask you to editorialize.
I asked you...

05:52.640 --> 05:54.802
if that was something
that Elena would say.

05:54.960 --> 05:56.450
<i>Yeah. I guess.</i>

05:58.240 --> 06:01.926
Walk away and forget this conversation.

06:03.280 --> 06:04.441
<i>Are you happy?</i>

06:04.680 --> 06:06.011
Can I leave now?

06:06.160 --> 06:07.969
No. Stay <i>close.</i>

06:08.120 --> 06:10.282
Matt is my Elena Gilbert cheat sheet.

06:10.440 --> 06:13.125
I didn't go through the drama
of taking over this body...

06:13.280 --> 06:15.965
to be outed because I didn't know
Bonnie's middle name.

06:16.120 --> 06:17.406
Which is Sheila, by the way.

06:17.640 --> 06:19.881
<i>You promised we would
spend some time together.</i>

06:20.040 --> 06:23.931
How long do you expect me to sit around
Mystic Grill like some sad, lonely barfly?

06:24.120 --> 06:27.647
Oh, please. Don't pretend
that babysitting Matty Blue Eyes...

06:27.800 --> 06:30.963
is some sort of hardship.
Didn't you lure him into bed in Prague?

06:31.160 --> 06:34.846
I didn't lure him. And I wasn't
compelling him to forget everything.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.685
- He's <i>not</i> a <i>puppet.
- Oh, okay. I get it.</i>

06:37.840 --> 06:39.683
You like him. That's adorable.

06:39.840 --> 06:41.842
Okay. I'm hanging up now.

06:49.440 --> 06:50.601
Hello.

06:50.800 --> 06:52.643
How are you holding up?

06:53.000 --> 06:55.890
What's going on? Who are you?

06:56.160 --> 07:00.006
My name is Dr. Wes Maxfield.
And you're Joey, right?

07:00.160 --> 07:03.687
I saw your name stitched onto
your work shirt when I grabbed you.

07:03.840 --> 07:06.684
Apologies, but I never managed
to make proper acquaintance...

07:06.840 --> 07:10.162
with the janitorial staff
before the hospital lost its funding.

07:10.840 --> 07:12.410
It's depressing, isn't it?

07:12.560 --> 07:15.689
- The economy is no friend to medicine.
- What do you want from me?

07:16.160 --> 07:17.571
I don't have any money.

07:17.720 --> 07:20.690
Ironically, Joey, neither do I.

07:21.000 --> 07:22.206
What did you do to me?

07:23.160 --> 07:26.528
- Why am I so hungry?
- Simple terms, I turned you into a vampire.

07:26.840 --> 07:30.162
Now I'm gonna condition you to feed
on other vampires instead of humans.

07:30.320 --> 07:31.731
What? You're what?

07:31.880 --> 07:34.531
Would you believe
that I've already done it once?

07:34.720 --> 07:36.722
Now all I have to do is replicate it.

07:37.560 --> 07:39.767
Research is just money and time.

07:39.920 --> 07:41.206
I've got time.

07:41.360 --> 07:44.011
<i>- I'll</i> find money.
- Perhaps I can help you with that.

07:46.560 --> 07:47.846
Who the hell are you?

07:48.000 --> 07:51.049
- I'm judging your crappy lab.
- Still didn't catch your name.

07:51.560 --> 07:54.848
Sloan. And I'm here to help you,
so you can lose the arrogance.

07:55.000 --> 07:57.685
I'm here to offer you
new funding for your research.

07:58.120 --> 07:59.531
What do you know about my research?

07:59.680 --> 08:02.411
I've been tracking
your Augustine experiments for months.

08:02.560 --> 08:05.166
So in return for money and protection...

08:05.320 --> 08:08.051
- I have some blood I want you to analyze.
- Sorry...

08:08.200 --> 08:11.363
but I'm done getting into bed
with mysterious benefactors.

08:11.520 --> 08:13.921
- And I don't need your protection.
- I beg to differ.

08:17.160 --> 08:18.844
This is Aaron's bag.

08:20.600 --> 08:23.968
- Where did you get this?
- I hate to be the one to tell you this...

08:24.120 --> 08:28.125
but Aaron Whitmore's car was found abandoned
in the middle of the road last night.

08:29.600 --> 08:31.762
- No.
- No one has seen or heard from him.

08:33.080 --> 08:36.049
- He's dead, isn't he?
- My guess is yes...

08:36.240 --> 08:37.480
he's dead.

08:37.640 --> 08:40.883
And more to the point, you're next.

08:43.200 --> 08:47.250
So once we've finished off this Augustine
mess, what do you say to a road trip?

08:47.400 --> 08:49.448
I was thinking South America, Cape Horn.

08:49.720 --> 08:52.041
Sailed past, but never stopped over.

08:52.200 --> 08:54.726
I'm not thinking that far ahead.

08:58.880 --> 09:01.121
Rise and shine, Diane.

09:01.440 --> 09:03.408
How's our favorite
head of Whitmore Security?

09:03.600 --> 09:04.806
That's ironic, isn't it?

09:04.960 --> 09:07.645
Since we broke in
and kidnapped you from your office.

09:08.280 --> 09:10.931
Let me go. Please.

09:11.080 --> 09:12.491
I have two kids.

09:12.640 --> 09:15.041
- A mother? Ah, interesting.
- Oh. Hm.

09:15.240 --> 09:19.165
You can imagine how heartbreaking it would
be to learn your child committed suicide.

09:19.320 --> 09:22.210
Especially when said child
was actually murdered by a vampire.

09:22.360 --> 09:26.046
- A murder covered up by you.
- I didn't do any such thing.

09:27.640 --> 09:30.610
Now, Diane...

09:30.760 --> 09:32.603
tell the truth.

09:34.480 --> 09:38.007
Did you cover up a vampire attack
on campus by forging...

09:38.160 --> 09:41.687
- ...a suicide note or two?
- Yes.

09:41.840 --> 09:44.320
Ah, looks like the vervain's
officially out of her system.

09:44.520 --> 09:49.162
Now I want you to tell me exactly
where I can find Dr. Wes Maxfield.

09:49.320 --> 09:52.847
I have no idea.
I haven't heard from him in days.

09:53.000 --> 09:55.162
Well, that's a shame, Diane.

09:55.360 --> 09:57.249
Because that makes you a dead end.

09:57.400 --> 10:00.404
Well, technically...

10:06.720 --> 10:08.085
Now she's a dead end.

10:09.960 --> 10:11.724
On to the next.

10:19.080 --> 10:21.811
I see Damon's got you
on shallow grave duty.

10:21.960 --> 10:23.530
Be a mate. Grab a shovel.

10:24.160 --> 10:27.562
I'll pass.
Buried enough skeletons out here.

10:28.560 --> 10:29.971
I'm sensing a metaphor.

10:30.120 --> 10:33.044
I think you need to find yourself
a new best friend.

10:33.200 --> 10:36.488
Damon's in a bad place right now.
You're not making things better.

10:36.760 --> 10:38.603
I know you just got out of captivity...

10:38.760 --> 10:41.843
and you're looking to blow off
a bit of steam, which is fine...

10:42.000 --> 10:46.289
- ...just do me a favor, leave my brother out of it.
- He mentioned you were a do-gooder.

10:46.800 --> 10:50.441
Yeah. You know what makes somebody
walk a straight line?

10:51.240 --> 10:55.564
When they have no choice but to be the balance
for somebody who's about to fall off the edge.

10:55.720 --> 10:59.122
Ah, but it's so much more fun
when you can just commit to the leap.

10:59.280 --> 11:01.931
- Hm.
- You're welcome to join in on the fun.

11:02.520 --> 11:03.851
Looks like you could use it.

11:07.400 --> 11:08.970
Good man.

11:14.560 --> 11:16.449
Why don't you be a mate, huh?

11:16.600 --> 11:19.649
Get in that car, start driving,
don't look back.

11:22.840 --> 11:24.330
You think that hurts?

11:25.440 --> 11:26.965
I'm curious, Stefan.

11:27.160 --> 11:31.210
What do you think you could possibly do to me
that hasn't been done a hundred times before?

11:31.360 --> 11:33.761
Go on. Give it your best shot.

11:36.080 --> 11:38.481
What I do to you, Enzo...

11:38.640 --> 11:41.450
will be final. You got it?

11:42.960 --> 11:44.803
Be sure I never see you again.

12:01.360 --> 12:02.885
Good.

12:03.200 --> 12:05.726
You're back. I need your help.

12:06.520 --> 12:08.966
Diamond or dangly?

12:09.160 --> 12:11.686
Since when does Elena Gilbert accessorize?

12:11.840 --> 12:16.164
Since she's being conned
to go to the Bitter Ball...

12:16.320 --> 12:18.561
with her best friend, Suzy Sunshine.

12:18.720 --> 12:21.371
You're not fooling anyone.
I know that you're faking it.

12:22.320 --> 12:24.129
Faking? Heh.

12:24.680 --> 12:27.889
- I'm what?
- Please. It is so obvious.

12:28.840 --> 12:30.842
I appreciate it. I do.

12:31.200 --> 12:33.885
You know I'm on edge
because of the whole Tyler/Klaus thing...

12:34.040 --> 12:37.886
so you are pretending that breaking up
with Damon was no big deal.

12:38.400 --> 12:40.368
Caroline Forbes...

12:40.520 --> 12:42.568
how do you always see right through me?

12:43.000 --> 12:45.207
Look, Elena, you don't have
to pretend with me.

12:45.520 --> 12:48.410
And if you don't wanna go tonight,
it's all good.

12:48.560 --> 12:50.528
I can be a bitter party of one.

12:55.960 --> 12:58.008
Do you think Stefan would wanna come?

12:58.160 --> 13:01.050
132;; was"...

13:01.200 --> 13:03.567
- heh, just about to call you.
- Hey.

13:03.760 --> 13:07.560
Listen, I need to talk to you,
but I didn't wanna do it over the phone.

13:07.760 --> 13:08.807
What's wrong?

13:09.160 --> 13:11.049
Let's just say it involves Enzo.

13:12.200 --> 13:13.247
Oh.

13:13.400 --> 13:16.051
Enzo. Uh, okay.

13:16.200 --> 13:18.726
<i>Then maybe we should meet in person.</i>

13:19.720 --> 13:22.724
Actually, Caroline's
dragging us to this, um...

13:22.880 --> 13:25.247
<i>This Whitmore thing for,
urn, lonely hearts.</i>

13:25.400 --> 13:26.970
I think you should come.

13:27.200 --> 13:29.885
Yeah, no, thanks,
I already did the college thing.

13:30.040 --> 13:32.771
- Twice, actually.
<i>- Please?</i>

13:32.920 --> 13:37.289
If it's bad, then I'll owe you a fun time.

13:39.360 --> 13:41.761
<i>Start a revolution in your soul</i>

13:41.960 --> 13:45.931
<i>Let's start it right now
Just to let you know</i>

13:46.560 --> 13:48.164
<i>So all the kids know</i>

13:48.320 --> 13:52.484
Mm. Give me whatever will obliterate
the memory of Caroline.

13:52.720 --> 13:54.802
- You said you weren't drinking today.
- No.

13:54.960 --> 13:57.247
I said I wasn't drinking alone today.

14:02.360 --> 14:03.441
She's new.

14:04.600 --> 14:06.648
Whatever you're thinking, un-think it.

14:07.000 --> 14:08.331
That's Katherine's daughter.

14:08.480 --> 14:10.608
And the psycho
doesn't fall far from the tree.

14:10.960 --> 14:12.962
I can hear you, you know.

14:13.640 --> 14:16.041
You locked me in a safe
and buried me alive.

14:16.240 --> 14:19.642
I'm sorry, but I was trying
to save my mother's life.

14:19.800 --> 14:20.961
And I failed.

14:21.360 --> 14:23.249
So if you don't mind...

14:23.760 --> 14:26.161
I'd like to sit here
and grieve in peace.

14:29.480 --> 14:30.527
You want a shot?

14:32.440 --> 14:33.487
I want a shot.

14:34.280 --> 14:35.327
Let's do shots.

14:35.640 --> 14:36.846
What?

14:37.000 --> 14:38.161
You heard her.

14:38.320 --> 14:40.482
She's sorry, her mom's dead.

14:41.520 --> 14:44.046
- Let's do shots.
- It's your funeral.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.047
<i>I think I found hell</i>

14:49.320 --> 14:53.006
My mom was so afraid I'd flunk
the eighth grade and embarrass her...

14:53.200 --> 14:55.487
she actually wrote
an entire English paper for me.

14:57.160 --> 15:00.084
Oh. My mother was so desperate
for companionship...

15:00.280 --> 15:03.204
she compelled an entire town
to be her friend.

15:03.640 --> 15:04.971
- Ooh.
- Heh-heh.

15:05.120 --> 15:07.043
Yeah. Cheers.

15:10.800 --> 15:12.211
My mom hooked up with you.

15:14.040 --> 15:15.087
Oh, my God.

15:15.920 --> 15:18.161
- Seriously?
- Afraid so.

15:19.040 --> 15:21.088
- Drink. Both of you.
- Wow.

15:21.520 --> 15:22.720
Kind of forgot about that one.

15:23.520 --> 15:24.601
Pour them up.

15:25.680 --> 15:26.886
- Up top.
- Heh-heh.

15:27.040 --> 15:29.327
Whoo-hoo! Whoo!

15:30.440 --> 15:32.090
Ah.

15:32.560 --> 15:35.211
- I have to pee.
- Hybrids pee?

15:36.240 --> 15:39.369
There's gotta be a fire hydrant joke
in there somewhere.

15:39.520 --> 15:41.568
- Hilarious.
- I thought it was funny.

15:41.720 --> 15:43.529
Pour another round.

15:45.320 --> 15:47.641
- Gladly.
- Ah. Heh.

15:50.360 --> 15:52.089
Who's Enzo?

15:54.240 --> 15:57.050
- I don't know. I've never met him.
- But you heard of him.

15:57.200 --> 16:00.568
He's Damon's buddy from Augustine.
They were cell mates for five years.

16:00.800 --> 16:03.087
I think he's free or something.

16:03.240 --> 16:04.321
Thank you.

16:05.120 --> 16:08.090
Forget everything I've
said since Tyler left.

16:14.120 --> 16:15.201
Ah.

16:15.440 --> 16:17.408
So we're going to a dance...

16:17.560 --> 16:21.406
but we can't show up together
because you can't bring a date?

16:21.560 --> 16:23.961
- Told you it was weird.
- Better idea.

16:24.120 --> 16:26.282
Let's get another hotel room instead.

16:27.080 --> 16:29.924
- Caroline would kill me.
- Bonnie, we're happy.

16:30.080 --> 16:31.445
Can't we just act like it?

16:31.880 --> 16:33.769
You know what? You're right.

16:33.920 --> 16:35.001
I am happy.

16:36.920 --> 16:40.686
It's like driving past a car crash,
except you want to look away.

16:40.880 --> 16:42.086
What are you doing here?

16:42.240 --> 16:45.642
I tutor some kids in calculus.
I like giving back. Be a good role model.

16:46.960 --> 16:49.804
Kidding. I'm here to kidnap your boyfriend.

16:56.600 --> 16:58.011
You're not funny.

16:58.200 --> 16:59.326
Let's get out of here.

17:00.240 --> 17:02.129
You're not going anywhere, buddy.

17:02.280 --> 17:05.965
- Let go of him.
- Or what? You'll glare me to death?

17:06.119 --> 17:09.602
You don't have your little magic wand
to back you up anymore, Bon Bon.

17:09.760 --> 17:11.171
- Hey. Hey.
- Ooh.

17:11.319 --> 17:12.970
- Leave her alone.
- Relax.

17:13.119 --> 17:14.848
I'm here for you, not her, you idiot.

17:15.000 --> 17:16.888
Keep up. Anyway, I have this hit list...

17:17.040 --> 17:20.203
and I can't find my last target,
so basically, I need a witch.

17:20.359 --> 17:24.365
Okay, well, you just said it.
I can't do magic anymore. So go away.

17:24.560 --> 17:26.642
Grams ran Occult Studies.

17:26.800 --> 17:29.565
I'm sure we could throw a rock,
hit a witch around here.

17:29.720 --> 17:31.484
Take this. This is Wes' blood.

17:31.920 --> 17:37.689
My buddy, Enzo, kept this as a souvenir.
Now, this should jump start a locator spell.

17:37.840 --> 17:40.161
- Ticktock.
- Are you deaf? She is not helping you.

17:40.600 --> 17:44.047
- You're not gonna hurt me. Elena would...
- Elena would what?

17:44.200 --> 17:47.249
Hurt me? Dump me?

17:47.600 --> 17:48.931
Been there. Done that.

17:49.080 --> 17:51.401
- Wrote the country song.
- Kill you.

17:51.720 --> 17:52.926
She would kill you.

17:53.920 --> 17:55.251
Cool.

17:55.400 --> 17:57.562
And then me and all her doppelgangers...

17:57.760 --> 18:01.048
- can start a baseball team on the Other Side.
- What have I missed?

18:01.720 --> 18:03.210
She denied your request yet?

18:03.560 --> 18:05.767
- Can we get on to the fun bit?
- Who are you?

18:05.920 --> 18:09.163
I'm the one who gets people
to do things they don't wanna do.

18:09.320 --> 18:10.731
Aah! Aah!

18:10.880 --> 18:12.006
- Stop!
- Aah!

18:12.160 --> 18:13.207
Stop!

18:13.400 --> 18:14.606
Okay, fine. I'll help.

18:20.200 --> 18:21.565
Dead corsage?

18:21.720 --> 18:23.563
Thank you.

18:24.280 --> 18:26.681
<i>Said it was wrong</i>

18:26.840 --> 18:30.162
<i>But it still felt right to me</i>

18:32.520 --> 18:34.204
<i>I was afraid</i>

18:34.360 --> 18:35.407
<i>Hey-</i>

18:36.920 --> 18:39.082
Hey. You made it.

18:39.720 --> 18:40.767
I did.

18:40.920 --> 18:44.402
So who thinks up these things?

18:45.760 --> 18:46.886
Lonely single people.

18:47.040 --> 18:49.566
- Ah.
- Heh. Come on.

18:49.720 --> 18:53.611
<i>And I can't breathe without you</i>

18:53.760 --> 18:55.250
See?

18:55.560 --> 18:57.608
As promised. Fun.

18:57.760 --> 18:58.921
You seem good.

18:59.720 --> 19:02.451
I got the same reaction from Caroline.

19:02.600 --> 19:05.410
Like I'm not allowed to smile or something.

19:05.680 --> 19:06.761
Did I say that?

19:06.920 --> 19:09.321
No, but I see your look.

19:09.480 --> 19:10.641
Oh, I have a look?

19:10.800 --> 19:13.644
- Heh. Yeah. That look.
- Mm.

19:14.000 --> 19:17.368
I'm fine. You don't have to worry about me.
I'm great, actually.

19:17.520 --> 19:20.490
I'm the only non-bitter person
at this Bitter Ball.

19:20.640 --> 19:21.721
Mm.

19:21.880 --> 19:24.690
Elena, listen, I, uh...
I need to talk to you about something.

19:24.840 --> 19:26.922
Damon, he got himself into some bad stuff.

19:27.080 --> 19:28.525
Yeah. Well, heh...

19:29.120 --> 19:31.327
it's what Damon does.

19:31.520 --> 19:34.000
If he gets the tiniest bit hurt...

19:34.160 --> 19:35.810
he lashes out. He doesn't think.

19:35.960 --> 19:38.361
He doesn't try.

19:38.800 --> 19:40.643
He just acts.

19:41.560 --> 19:45.804
And for the longest time,
I tried to fix him.

19:45.960 --> 19:48.327
I tried to change him...

19:48.480 --> 19:50.767
but I think he ended up changing me.

19:51.320 --> 19:54.483
And I'm not sure that I like
the person that I've become.

19:54.640 --> 19:56.881
I mean, do you?

19:57.720 --> 19:59.131
Do I what?

20:00.400 --> 20:02.528
Do you like who I am?

20:03.160 --> 20:05.208
Or do you miss who I was?

20:07.720 --> 20:10.530
- Elena, I...
- Let's change the subject.

20:11.120 --> 20:13.043
What did you wanna tell me?

20:13.720 --> 20:15.882
What did Enzo and Damon do now?

20:16.040 --> 20:18.771
You know what?
Can we talk about it later? Is that okay?

20:18.920 --> 20:21.571
- That's fine by me.
- Okay.

20:22.320 --> 20:24.004
- Hey.
- Hey.

20:24.200 --> 20:28.000
Do you mind if I borrow her? She promised
she'd join me at the shredding station.

20:28.680 --> 20:31.251
Sure. Yeah, no, she's, uh, all yours.

20:31.400 --> 20:33.482
- Thanks.
- The shredding station?

20:35.200 --> 20:38.682
- Nadia's not compelling me.
- Really? Where the hell's your vervain?

20:38.880 --> 20:40.405
It's right here.

20:40.840 --> 20:44.208
You see? She swiped it and probably
compelled you not to notice.

20:44.360 --> 20:48.843
- Why would Nadia be compelling me?
- I have no idea. ls there any vervain here?

20:49.120 --> 20:52.522
Yeah. Sheriff Forbes
makes me put it in the coffee.

20:55.200 --> 20:57.043
Drink some. Now.

21:04.520 --> 21:06.568
<i>Who would've known?</i>

21:06.720 --> 21:10.520
<i>Now, I'd rather die than watch as you go</i>

21:10.680 --> 21:12.250
<i>I never learned</i>

21:12.400 --> 21:14.641
Did you bring anything to shred?

21:14.800 --> 21:18.521
No, because I didn't realize
people still printed photos.

21:18.680 --> 21:21.889
<i>Ever love</i>

21:24.760 --> 21:26.569
Okay. Do you feel cleansed?

21:26.880 --> 21:27.961
Almost.

21:28.680 --> 21:30.250
<i>Ever love</i>

21:30.400 --> 21:32.368
Tyler drew you a horse?

21:32.560 --> 21:34.449
No. Klaus did.

21:37.240 --> 21:38.480
Wow.

21:39.440 --> 21:40.771
- Clean sweep.
- Yes.

21:40.920 --> 21:42.604
I am making a decision.

21:42.760 --> 21:44.649
These relationships are over.

21:44.800 --> 21:46.609
- Over.
- I'm not going to change my mind...

21:46.760 --> 21:49.650
just because
I'm feeling bored or nostalgic...

21:49.800 --> 21:51.404
or lonely. Heh.

21:52.680 --> 21:53.806
<i>Ever love</i>

21:53.960 --> 21:56.486
Are you doing that thing
where you're talking about yourself...

21:56.640 --> 21:59.120
but really you're talking about me?

21:59.280 --> 22:03.330
I'm just saying
that you've been through a lot lately.

22:03.640 --> 22:06.564
Your emotions are all over the place.
So are Stefan's.

22:06.760 --> 22:10.970
I think that making yourself so available
could maybe be confusing things.

22:12.680 --> 22:14.409
Do you think that I'm leading him on?

22:14.600 --> 22:17.809
No, I didn't say that, I just... I...

22:18.240 --> 22:21.847
Ugh, just forget it.
Just, heh, forget everything I said.

22:22.440 --> 22:23.930
Okay.

22:24.400 --> 22:29.531
Oh. This makes me so happy
I'm not 19 and stupid.

22:30.680 --> 22:34.446
All right, Bonnie.
Where's your little witch friend?

22:34.600 --> 22:37.809
Liv Parker. She's in one of my classes.

22:38.000 --> 22:42.449
She's not my friend. I looked her up.
Found out she works events catering.

22:42.600 --> 22:44.170
This is a total shot in the dark.

22:44.320 --> 22:47.324
Well, I'm feeling lucky.

22:50.200 --> 22:51.326
- Hey.
- Hey.

22:51.480 --> 22:53.801
- Come on. Come be bitter with me.
- No, no, no.

22:53.960 --> 22:56.930
You are the second person
that I didn't come here to dance with.

22:57.440 --> 23:00.523
Okay, then what are you not telling Elena?

23:00.840 --> 23:03.161
Way to eavesdrop, Caroline.

23:03.360 --> 23:06.125
You came to a dance of your own free will.

23:06.320 --> 23:07.526
Something is up.

23:07.680 --> 23:09.170
Okay, fine.

23:09.360 --> 23:11.203
Damon fell off the deep end.

23:11.960 --> 23:15.681
Uh, what do you mean exactly
by "deep end"?

23:15.840 --> 23:19.890
For starters, he killed
Elena's friend, Aaron.

23:20.080 --> 23:22.048
- He...? What?
- Yeah.

23:22.200 --> 23:26.410
And I came here to tell her, but we were
dancing, and she seemed so happy...

23:26.560 --> 23:28.369
and I just couldn't.

23:28.520 --> 23:32.206
You think if you tell her what he did
that she'll give up on him forever?

23:32.360 --> 23:36.570
Yeah, I know she will. And I don't think
I'll be able to pull Damon back from that.

23:37.400 --> 23:39.607
I mean, I've seen Damon at his worst,
Caroline...

23:39.760 --> 23:42.491
and I actually think he enjoys
the way it makes him feel.

23:42.640 --> 23:46.565
Like the more pain he can cause, the more
reasons there are for people to hate him.

23:46.720 --> 23:50.406
He wants to confirm everyone's
lowest expectations of him.

23:50.560 --> 23:53.848
And I just, honestly,
don't know how to fight that side of him.

23:56.040 --> 23:58.691
Why all the dramatics, brother?

23:59.080 --> 24:01.401
- What are you doing here?
- Bonnie, what's going on?

24:01.560 --> 24:04.484
Don't worry. I'm not her date.
We're not gonna break any rules.

24:04.640 --> 24:06.642
How about you just
answer the damn question?

24:06.840 --> 24:11.289
Well, Bonnie is gonna find me a witch
to do a locator spell...

24:11.440 --> 24:13.841
on the elusive Dr. Wes Maxfield.

24:14.000 --> 24:17.607
She's gonna find him, I'm gonna kill him.
Bon Bon, should I tell them?

24:18.560 --> 24:20.050
Enzo has Jeremy.

24:20.680 --> 24:23.604
If I don't get a witch
to find Wes by midnight...

24:24.240 --> 24:25.287
he'll kill him.

24:25.800 --> 24:26.961
Crikk.

24:54.760 --> 24:58.651
Hypothetical question, if Jeremy Gilbert's
life was hanging by a thread...

24:58.800 --> 25:01.610
could I credibly just let him die?

25:01.760 --> 25:04.331
Because his death would be
really convenient for me.

25:04.520 --> 25:07.091
Are you seriously making
a pros and cons list?

25:07.240 --> 25:09.766
Are there any cons?
Because I've only listed pros.

25:09.920 --> 25:11.604
<i>- Katherine.
- I'm just saying.</i>

25:11.760 --> 25:15.446
His death would earn me a lot of tenderness
and sympathy from Stefan.

25:15.600 --> 25:18.922
If Jeremy is in danger,
Elena would do everything to save his life.

25:19.120 --> 25:21.122
<i>- You know that.
- But Stefan is here.</i>

25:21.280 --> 25:22.770
We were dancing. It was good.

25:23.200 --> 25:25.328
And I think he was even flirting with me...

25:25.640 --> 25:27.847
which is very naughty, even for him.

25:28.040 --> 25:32.602
Listen, if you don't start acting like you
care, they will figure out you're not Elena.

25:32.800 --> 25:35.804
So if I happen to know
exactly where he is...

25:35.960 --> 25:39.965
I'm supposed to go and put my life in
danger to save that little rug rat's life?

25:40.120 --> 25:41.451
Do you know where he is?

25:41.640 --> 25:43.449
<i>He's at that hideous Whitmore house.</i>

25:43.640 --> 25:45.529
I recognize it from the picture.

25:45.680 --> 25:48.843
Apparently, I'm the only one
who's been to a Whitmore tea party.

25:49.000 --> 25:50.843
Save him, now.

25:51.000 --> 25:53.128
Okay, fine. But in the meantime...

25:53.320 --> 25:57.120
I'm gonna need you to find out from Matt
if Caroline has feelings for Stefan.

25:57.480 --> 25:59.323
<i>Because she's really starting to grate.</i>

25:59.800 --> 26:01.484
I need to know what I'm up against.

26:09.800 --> 26:12.883
- Who keeps calling you?
- Does Caroline have feelings for Stefan?

26:13.280 --> 26:14.850
Caroline?

26:15.320 --> 26:17.322
- I have no idea.
- Think.

26:17.480 --> 26:20.848
Has Elena ever been worried
Caroline might steal Stefan away?

26:21.320 --> 26:23.163
Have they ever fought about him?

26:24.000 --> 26:25.684
Not that I know of.

26:25.840 --> 26:28.002
So you think Elena can win Stefan back?

26:28.680 --> 26:30.041
Why are you asking me about Elena?

26:31.400 --> 26:32.845
Forget we had this conversation.

26:36.080 --> 26:38.242
So was I right?

26:38.680 --> 26:42.048
Ty, you're not gonna believe
what I'm about to tell you.

26:45.200 --> 26:47.521
You're not going to tell him anything.

26:50.840 --> 26:53.525
Hey, you okay?

26:56.400 --> 26:58.721
I just can't lose Jeremy again.

26:58.880 --> 27:00.211
<i>I didn't know love could hurt this way</i>

27:00.360 --> 27:02.089
Stefan, please...

27:02.240 --> 27:05.562
<i>I didn't know love
I didn't know love</i>

27:05.720 --> 27:07.370
help me save him.

27:16.480 --> 27:17.561
<i>Hey-</i>

27:17.720 --> 27:19.768
- This room's off-limits.
- Look...

27:19.920 --> 27:23.242
under normal circumstances,
I'd probably try to warm up to you...

27:23.400 --> 27:27.928
be your friend or something, but I'm kind of
under a time crunch. And I need your help.

27:29.720 --> 27:32.929
- Am I supposed to know you?
- We're in sociology together.

27:33.080 --> 27:36.129
I'm Bonnie. My grams, Sheila Bennett,
used to teach here.

27:36.280 --> 27:37.930
Occult Studies?

27:38.080 --> 27:39.445
Never heard of it.

27:39.600 --> 27:41.409
Or her, so...

27:41.560 --> 27:42.766
I know you're a witch.

27:43.920 --> 27:46.400
I saw you spin that pen this morning.

27:46.920 --> 27:48.922
I have no idea what you're talking about.

27:49.080 --> 27:51.606
You don't have to be scared.
I used to be one too.

27:52.920 --> 27:55.764
Yeah? No.

27:55.920 --> 27:58.764
Try the Campus Coven Club or something.

28:00.920 --> 28:02.331
I really need your help.

28:04.800 --> 28:08.122
Even if I wanted to help, I couldn't.

28:08.680 --> 28:11.126
I don't know what I'm doing.

28:11.680 --> 28:14.445
I'm just some freak, okay?

28:15.040 --> 28:16.166
Now, leave me alone.

28:18.280 --> 28:21.284
Oh, my God. What the hell are you?

28:21.440 --> 28:22.805
You're gonna help my friend.

28:24.280 --> 28:26.169
Do I need to say it slower?

28:37.000 --> 28:40.641
Vampires are real? Okay, that makes sense.

28:40.800 --> 28:42.325
Actually, that makes no sense.

28:42.480 --> 28:44.847
Concentrate. Forget about the vampires.

28:46.040 --> 28:48.327
Focus on tapping into your power.

28:48.640 --> 28:50.642
Listen to the sound of your heart beating.

28:51.520 --> 28:53.010
The sound of your lungs...

28:53.640 --> 28:56.325
- ...filling with air.
- How long is this gonna take?

28:56.480 --> 29:00.849
For a newbie witch to learn
a complicated spell under massive stress?

29:02.000 --> 29:03.570
I have no idea. Bonnie?

29:03.760 --> 29:05.683
Repeat after me:

29:12.080 --> 29:14.367
- Wait, what?
- Just relax.

29:26.680 --> 29:28.205
Now, keep your eyes closed...

29:28.720 --> 29:30.848
and use the blood to find Wes.

29:31.000 --> 29:33.844
- I have no idea what he looks like.
- You don't have to.

29:56.000 --> 29:57.047
That a good sign?

29:57.200 --> 29:59.441
- I can't do this.
- Just concentrate. Try again...

29:59.600 --> 30:02.046
I can't do this. Don't you get it?

30:02.200 --> 30:05.727
I've done horrible things.
I've set buildings on fire...

30:06.400 --> 30:07.606
I've hurt people.

30:07.880 --> 30:09.405
I can't control any of it.

30:12.640 --> 30:15.450
Witchy hotline, how may I help you?
Damon speaking.

30:15.600 --> 30:17.090
What's taking so long?

30:17.240 --> 30:19.402
<i>They seem to have lost motivation.</i>

30:19.920 --> 30:21.251
Maybe you can inspire them.

30:21.400 --> 30:23.448
Heh. With pleasure.

30:25.040 --> 30:28.408
Let them know
Jeremy will be dead very soon.

30:30.400 --> 30:32.402
- Thank you.
- What are you doing?

30:32.600 --> 30:35.683
Damon, call him back right now
and you tell him to stop.

30:35.840 --> 30:37.604
Damon, call him back.

30:37.920 --> 30:41.447
Just so you know,
cooperation is not optional.

30:51.720 --> 30:55.770
Damon tells me your sweetheart
hasn't come through on your behalf.

30:59.400 --> 31:01.129
What are you gonna do?

31:01.280 --> 31:04.124
I'm sure killing me would
really inspire her.

31:05.600 --> 31:06.965
You know, you're right.

31:07.800 --> 31:10.406
She'll think I'm just some cliché murderer.

31:10.760 --> 31:15.129
I really like to make
a good impression, you know?

31:20.920 --> 31:22.285
You don't have to do this.

31:25.360 --> 31:27.328
You see, that's the thing about threats.

31:27.480 --> 31:31.963
If there's no follow-through,
no one takes you seriously.

31:33.760 --> 31:35.489
Sorry to make this about me.

31:46.640 --> 31:49.325
See? That wasn't so bad.

31:51.000 --> 31:52.331
I've done bad things too.

31:52.480 --> 31:55.450
I've broken windows,
I've set more fires than I can count.

31:55.640 --> 31:57.961
Is that supposed to make me feel better?

31:58.120 --> 32:01.488
I'm saying I learned how to control it.
I can teach you the same thing.

32:05.840 --> 32:07.171
This is Jeremy.

32:08.000 --> 32:09.001
He's cute.

32:09.520 --> 32:11.682
Yeah, he is.

32:12.000 --> 32:15.368
And his life is literally in your hands.

32:16.960 --> 32:18.007
Oh, jeez.

32:19.680 --> 32:25.369
Okay, but if I go all Carrie
and burn the school down, it's on you.

32:25.520 --> 32:27.045
Okay.

32:31.880 --> 32:33.370
Jeremy.

32:34.520 --> 32:35.885
Jer.

32:36.360 --> 32:38.328
Damn it, Jeremy.

32:39.560 --> 32:40.891
Ew.

32:41.040 --> 32:43.407
You should've left when I told you to.

32:43.880 --> 32:47.407
Did I give you the impression
I was taking orders from you? My bad.

32:50.520 --> 32:51.726
Come on.

32:55.040 --> 32:57.042
Come on, wake up, Jeremy.

33:09.560 --> 33:10.925
Ugh. Thank God.

33:17.080 --> 33:19.367
Stefan, help. Oh.

33:19.520 --> 33:21.204
You missed all the fun.

33:21.760 --> 33:24.081
Spell worked. Wes is in Richmond.

33:24.560 --> 33:26.483
Brilliant. I'll drive.

33:28.080 --> 33:29.206
Hey, Damon.

33:32.600 --> 33:34.602
Don't bother coming back.

33:42.120 --> 33:44.248
I wasn't planning on it.

34:02.280 --> 34:04.248
What happened? Where's Nadia?

34:04.400 --> 34:06.971
- Sorry, slight misunderstanding.
- She snapped my neck.

34:07.120 --> 34:10.920
- What kind of misunderstanding is that?
- You were right. She was compelling me.

34:11.080 --> 34:13.969
She wanted to talk about Katherine
and she knew I was pissed at her.

34:14.480 --> 34:17.802
I guess they didn't settle their
mother-daughter issues before she died.

34:18.440 --> 34:20.090
She wanted to talk about Katherine?

34:20.280 --> 34:24.489
Yeah, but she knew that you would go after
her if you knew she was frying my mind.

34:24.960 --> 34:28.760
She's got that whole stone-cold survival
thing going. Like mother, like daughter.

34:28.960 --> 34:32.009
A little friendly advice?
Stay the hell away from her.

34:32.960 --> 34:36.123
- Yep, I plan on it.
- You call me if she gives you any more hassle.

34:44.679 --> 34:46.011
I took care of it.

34:46.159 --> 34:48.527
If he follows us, I'll kill you both.

34:48.679 --> 34:50.011
I said, I took care of it.

34:51.480 --> 34:54.165
Earlier on the phone,
you weren't talking to Elena.

34:54.360 --> 34:56.681
You were talking to someone
who needed information.

34:57.280 --> 34:59.851
Do yourself a favor
and stop asking questions.

35:00.200 --> 35:03.807
Your boyfriend once planted himself
inside my brain.

35:03.960 --> 35:06.804
That's how you were planning
on saving Katherine.

35:08.040 --> 35:10.361
She didn't die, did she?

35:11.040 --> 35:13.566
She jumped inside Elena. Unh!

35:13.720 --> 35:16.041
The only thing easier
than breaking your neck...

35:16.200 --> 35:18.646
is taking off your magic life ring.

35:19.040 --> 35:21.202
Do you understand?

35:21.960 --> 35:23.644
Yeah.

35:23.800 --> 35:25.211
What are you gonna do with me?

35:25.360 --> 35:27.362
I haven't decided yet.

35:28.560 --> 35:32.042
First, we need to get
the vervain out of your system.

35:32.200 --> 35:33.804
And then...

35:34.680 --> 35:35.727
we'll see.

35:42.240 --> 35:43.890
So, what do you say?

35:44.040 --> 35:48.523
Paper, scissors, stone for who gets to give
Dr. Frankenstein his fatal blow?

35:48.680 --> 35:50.205
No, he's all yours.

35:50.360 --> 35:53.728
Don't tell me you're having second thoughts
about leaving home.

35:54.240 --> 35:56.083
I was there for Elena. We're done.

35:56.240 --> 35:57.241
No reason to go back.

35:58.600 --> 36:00.728
What about your brother?

36:01.520 --> 36:03.568
You saw his face.

36:03.760 --> 36:05.888
I know that look. He's done with me too.

36:14.040 --> 36:17.089
- And you are?
- My backup.

36:20.440 --> 36:21.771
You gotta be kidding me.

36:24.280 --> 36:26.282
- What is this? Aah!
- Aah!

36:26.440 --> 36:28.283
- More witches?
- Close.

36:29.600 --> 36:30.647
Travelers.

36:35.440 --> 36:38.125
Good luck making new friends, Damon.

36:50.120 --> 36:51.929
Ow.

36:52.080 --> 36:53.127
You Okay?

36:53.480 --> 36:55.005
Oh, um...

36:55.160 --> 36:59.370
You know, actually, would you mind?
I think I still have a splinter in my back.

36:59.520 --> 37:01.090
Yeah.

37:01.720 --> 37:03.324
Sure.

37:10.600 --> 37:12.443
Yeah, there it is.

37:13.320 --> 37:16.085
- Oh.
- Try not to move.

37:17.200 --> 37:18.884
I'm sorry.

37:21.960 --> 37:24.804
I think I know what you wanted
to tell me tonight, Stefan.

37:30.120 --> 37:31.565
Got it.

37:35.640 --> 37:37.881
Damon killed Aaron, didn't he?

37:39.720 --> 37:43.008
He walked right through the threshold
at the Whitmore house.

37:43.480 --> 37:46.563
He couldn't have done that
if the owner hadn't been dead.

37:48.600 --> 37:50.648
Aaron was the owner.

37:51.160 --> 37:54.846
Yeah, I should have told you. I'm sorry.

37:55.080 --> 37:58.368
Why didn't you? I thought that we...

37:59.680 --> 38:04.208
Maybe I don't deserve anything from you...

38:04.360 --> 38:07.489
but I thought we could be
honest with each other no matter what.

38:08.200 --> 38:09.884
You want me to be honest?

38:10.280 --> 38:11.327
Yes.

38:16.480 --> 38:17.686
All right.

38:22.160 --> 38:25.687
Truth is, ever since the first time
I noticed you falling for my brother...

38:27.480 --> 38:31.246
I have been waiting for him
to screw something up so badly...

38:31.400 --> 38:32.526
that you hate him.

38:33.720 --> 38:39.648
So I've been waiting and watching him
do all these horrible things...

38:41.240 --> 38:44.244
and then every single time
I think that he's gone too far...

38:45.640 --> 38:47.210
he's there for you.

38:49.320 --> 38:53.644
Sometimes in ways better than I ever was.

38:54.720 --> 38:56.688
So the truth is...

38:57.400 --> 39:00.722
after a while,
I just stopped waiting for him to fail...

39:02.200 --> 39:06.125
because I liked the person
that he had become.

39:09.560 --> 39:11.847
And I don't wanna lose that person.

39:13.880 --> 39:16.087
He threatened my brother.

39:16.240 --> 39:17.924
Stefan, I can't go back to that.

39:18.240 --> 39:19.765
I know.

39:19.960 --> 39:24.761
But if you wanna save him from himself,
then I'll help you.

39:25.960 --> 39:28.884
But not for myself, and not for him.

39:32.040 --> 39:33.565
For you.

39:58.080 --> 39:59.605
<i>Hey-</i>

40:01.160 --> 40:02.764
Oh.

40:04.800 --> 40:06.131
Ooh.

40:12.840 --> 40:15.241
- What did he stick you with?
- I don't know.

40:15.400 --> 40:17.323
All right. Come here.

40:19.960 --> 40:23.806
I can tell you, if he stuck me with that
vampire poison, we might have a problem.

40:23.960 --> 40:27.009
- What kind of problem?
- Wes has this sick little scheme...

40:27.160 --> 40:29.481
to destroy vampires by making them
feed on each other.

40:33.720 --> 40:35.688
You hear that?

40:58.600 --> 40:59.806
<i>Psst.</i>

41:03.040 --> 41:05.008
Can you get me out of here?

41:06.200 --> 41:08.043
I don't want to be here.

41:08.200 --> 41:09.201
I need to get out.

41:13.560 --> 41:14.766
Oh.

41:16.040 --> 41:18.042
Thanks. I owe you one.

41:21.320 --> 41:22.560
What's happening to you?

41:24.120 --> 41:26.088
I'm gonna go ahead and say karma.

41:27.400 --> 41:29.243
Karma is happening to me.

41:33.200 --> 41:35.248
Damon? Damon, stop.

41:42.760 --> 41:44.091
Okay.

41:46.320 --> 41:49.369
I can see how this might be a problem.
