WEBVTT

00:00.934 --> 00:04.166
So, coasting time
is officially over.

00:04.605 --> 00:07.803
Big changes are coming,
and they're coming fast.

00:08.509 --> 00:10.102
If you don't like 'em,

00:10.177 --> 00:12.669
this is called a door,
you can walk
right through it.

00:12.779 --> 00:14.338
All right? I'm not
here to be your friend.

00:14.715 --> 00:16.911
I like my life
outside of this place.

00:16.984 --> 00:18.919
I live to leave at 5:00.

00:19.686 --> 00:21.518
Change number one, Darryl.

00:21.588 --> 00:25.923
Per your request,
the company is sending you
to business school at night.

00:25.993 --> 00:27.825
Full ride, deal with it.

00:28.729 --> 00:31.198
Seriously?
Stone-cold seriously.

00:31.431 --> 00:35.596
They are trying
to figure me out,
and I don't like it.

00:37.271 --> 00:41.265
Once they figure me out,
they start to tell me
what I want to hear.

00:41.341 --> 00:43.936
And I need to
quickly figure out
who's a good worker,

00:44.011 --> 00:46.913
and who is simply
a good mind reader.

00:47.314 --> 00:50.045
Because as soon
as I'm hearing
what I wanna hear,

00:50.150 --> 00:51.880
I'm not gonna care.

00:52.252 --> 00:54.221
Change two, Toby.
You're getting a new chair.

00:55.455 --> 00:57.321
Thanks.
Don't thank me.

00:57.558 --> 00:59.527
Hey, don't thank me, guy.

00:59.927 --> 01:01.020
Okay?

01:01.094 --> 01:02.357
I don't care
if you like it.

01:02.429 --> 01:05.364
These sound like good ideas,
why wouldn't we like them?

01:05.465 --> 01:08.731
I don't care what
your favorite flavor is.

01:08.802 --> 01:11.499
Here's a bowl of ice cream,
you either like it
or you don't.

01:11.905 --> 01:14.101
That's my attitude
right now in this room,

01:14.174 --> 01:17.440
that's my attitude on
"Ice Cream Thursdays."

01:18.278 --> 01:19.610
All right?

01:19.980 --> 01:21.175
Clear? Any questions?

01:21.515 --> 01:23.381
This all sounds great to me.

01:27.254 --> 01:30.918
But I could see
how some people might
think that they're bad.

01:32.459 --> 01:34.018
I don't know what to think.

01:34.895 --> 01:36.295
That is a...

01:36.930 --> 01:38.956
An astute observation, Kevin.

01:39.032 --> 01:40.796
Kev's got me pegged.

02:15.035 --> 02:17.197
It blows away
Vermont in the fall.

02:17.270 --> 02:18.533
DARRYL: Snap, for real?

02:18.605 --> 02:19.800
DEANGELO: Not even...
Good morning, Deangelo.

02:19.873 --> 02:21.034
Hold on, Pam.
Okay.

02:21.108 --> 02:22.474
And if you're really serious,

02:23.343 --> 02:24.470
you should go in the spring.

02:24.778 --> 02:26.644
'Cause of the flowers.
No.

02:26.713 --> 02:29.444
Because the entire
state smells like earth.

02:29.516 --> 02:30.609
Dogwoods,
or just the earth?

02:31.351 --> 02:32.341
Yes, Pam.

02:32.719 --> 02:35.518
Hey, well, good morning.
I think I have good
news for you today.

02:35.589 --> 02:38.491
I found your new
executive assistant,
my friend, Carla.

02:38.625 --> 02:40.150
She's got
great experience,

02:40.227 --> 02:42.219
we even considered
making her Cece's godmother,

02:42.295 --> 02:43.661
but she had this
boyfriend at the time.

02:43.730 --> 02:45.255
But here's her resume.
Put it with the rest.

02:45.365 --> 02:46.458
Okay.
(CLEARS THROAT)

02:46.967 --> 02:48.435
Hey, dudes.
Hey.

02:48.502 --> 02:49.561
Hey.

02:49.770 --> 02:52.035
Oh, my God, he hates me.
No, he doesn't.

02:52.105 --> 02:53.869
You just get so nervous
and hyper around him.

02:53.940 --> 02:55.738
I know.
Every time
there's a silence,

02:55.809 --> 02:57.641
your brain's, like...

02:57.744 --> 02:59.838
Is that what he tells you
at your little
inner circle meetings?

02:59.913 --> 03:01.848
Careful,
there is no inner circle.

03:03.016 --> 03:05.451
Oh, there is
an inner circle.
Oh, yeah.

03:06.319 --> 03:07.878
There is no inner circle.

03:08.221 --> 03:12.386
<i>Deangelo just prefers</i>
<i>to delegate a few</i>
<i>things to a few guys.</i>

03:12.659 --> 03:16.187
Jim only says that
because he's in
the inner circle.

03:16.997 --> 03:21.196
I also say that
because I am also
in the inner circle.

03:22.602 --> 03:23.865
Did you get that, ma?

03:23.937 --> 03:28.466
Your boy, Kevin Malone,
is in the inner circle,

03:31.878 --> 03:33.642
which doesn't exist.

03:37.350 --> 03:39.285
There he is.
Got you coffee.

03:39.352 --> 03:42.254
Oh, wow, thank you,
that was so kind of you.

03:45.158 --> 03:46.387
Not a coffee guy,
I take it, huh?

03:46.460 --> 03:48.429
It's just that I
own the coffee shop.

03:48.495 --> 03:51.192
So once you've seen
sausage being made,

03:51.498 --> 03:53.763
all you wanna do
is make sausage
'cause it's so much fun.

03:53.834 --> 03:58.295
Listen, I've got a sixer,
<i>Automatic for the People</i>
on the jukebox.

03:58.872 --> 04:01.103
Let's hit the park
after sundown, come on.

04:01.174 --> 04:02.267
Pick up some sausage
if you want.

04:02.709 --> 04:06.737
I think you'll find
what you're looking for
over there.

04:11.051 --> 04:14.021
No matter how many times
I reach out to Dwight,

04:14.087 --> 04:17.023
he doesn't seem to want
anything to do with me.

04:17.124 --> 04:19.524
It reminds me of
my relationship
with my son.

04:19.593 --> 04:21.789
Except there,
I'm the Dwight.

04:22.496 --> 04:23.725
Who's the biggest
client in the state?

04:24.331 --> 04:25.959
I say we go get 'em,
whatever it takes.

04:26.299 --> 04:27.494
What do you guys say?

04:28.135 --> 04:29.296
KEVIN: Yes.
Right?

04:29.369 --> 04:33.067
DARRYL: Let's do it.
Or my other idea,
50,000 tiny clients.

04:33.140 --> 04:35.939
Yeah, I say that
we just go for it.

04:37.377 --> 04:38.902
Is that ball
lighter than usual?

04:39.045 --> 04:40.138
Is that
a Chinatown knockoff?

04:40.280 --> 04:41.373
That's Toys "R" Us,
I think.

04:41.448 --> 04:42.711
No, that's definitely
a knockoff.

04:42.783 --> 04:44.547
You can feel
the center of gravity
is off.

04:44.618 --> 04:46.086
Feel that,
what do you think?

04:46.219 --> 04:47.710
Oh, yeah, totally.

04:47.788 --> 04:48.949
Jim, you got
ripped off big time.

04:49.089 --> 04:50.284
Deangelo!

04:51.424 --> 04:53.256
See what I did there?
That's what you need to do.

04:53.326 --> 04:55.852
Just add a little English.
The British are coming.

04:55.929 --> 04:57.329
KEVIN: Yes.
DEANGELO: Deangelo's open!

04:57.931 --> 05:00.560
Hey, Ry.
Your department's
killing it, baby.

05:00.634 --> 05:02.865
Hey! My pleasure,
my treasure.

05:03.170 --> 05:04.160
Keep it up.

05:04.271 --> 05:09.175
The problem with
having it, or,
the X factor,

05:09.242 --> 05:11.336
or whatever it is
you wanna call it,

05:11.411 --> 05:14.609
is that
it's impossible to
put into words

05:15.382 --> 05:17.977
what you're
bringing to the table.

05:18.051 --> 05:20.987
So, to make things
simpler for Deangelo,
I just, without lying,

05:21.054 --> 05:24.024
strongly implied that
I'm Kelly's supervisor.

05:24.090 --> 05:25.786
It's not even that
much of a stretch.

05:25.926 --> 05:27.656
She pretty much
does whatever I say.

05:27.761 --> 05:30.287
What?
I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

05:30.363 --> 05:32.127
Why should I pretend
that you are my boss?

05:32.199 --> 05:34.065
Because what
would you have done
in that situation, Kelly?

05:34.134 --> 05:36.763
I'll tell you what I
would have done for you.
I'd lie for you.

05:36.837 --> 05:39.102
Yeah,
but you lie all the time.
You lie for no reason.

05:39.272 --> 05:40.570
Ryan, you just
like to lie.

05:40.774 --> 05:41.901
I'd die for you, too.

05:42.909 --> 05:43.899
You really would?

05:44.244 --> 05:47.703
Hey, Kelly Kapoor,
if I don't have those
call logs on my desk,

05:47.781 --> 05:51.343
we're just gonna
have to evaluate
your future at the company.

05:52.152 --> 05:53.711
Sure thing, Mr. Howard.

05:54.187 --> 05:55.746
Glad he's not my boss.

05:57.991 --> 05:58.981
You're the best, thank you.

06:03.196 --> 06:06.257
You know, I have a cousin
who cracked the secret formula

06:06.333 --> 06:08.495
for a certain popular cola
that I shall not name.

06:09.102 --> 06:12.595
So I've never
had to buy it.
True story.

06:12.672 --> 06:14.072
I just drink
my cousin's.

06:14.140 --> 06:16.473
Congratulations
on your one cousin.

06:16.610 --> 06:18.977
I have 70, each one
better than the last.

06:20.013 --> 06:23.677
You know what?
Straight up,
why don't you like me?

06:23.850 --> 06:27.082
I'm just not a suck up
like everyone else
around here, okay?

06:27.387 --> 06:30.846
I do my job well,
so why don't you
just leave me alone,

06:31.124 --> 06:33.286
and let me do it. Okay?

06:34.594 --> 06:35.892
Oh, no.

06:35.962 --> 06:36.952
What...
Okay?

06:37.731 --> 06:39.461
I'm gonna win you over.
No, you're not.

06:39.532 --> 06:40.522
Yes, I am.
No.

06:40.634 --> 06:41.624
Oh, yes.
No.

06:41.701 --> 06:42.691
Yes.
No.

06:42.769 --> 06:43.759
Yes!
No!

06:43.837 --> 06:45.100
Yes! Yes!
No! No!

06:45.171 --> 06:48.403
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!

06:48.475 --> 06:50.444
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes...

06:50.977 --> 06:52.001
Uh-oh.

06:52.078 --> 06:54.070
This former
administrative assistant

06:54.214 --> 06:56.240
misspelled "administrative,"
and "assistant."

06:56.683 --> 06:58.174
The winner.

06:58.251 --> 07:03.155
Under special skills,
Mr. Don Finer put juggling.

07:03.356 --> 07:04.551
(ALL LAUGHING)

07:05.558 --> 07:07.754
What's wrong with juggling,
Darryl?

07:07.894 --> 07:09.556
I'm a big juggler.

07:09.729 --> 07:12.198
I actually perform
a motivational
juggling routine.

07:12.532 --> 07:14.330
Seriously?
Oh, yeah.

07:15.535 --> 07:17.697
I'd do it for you
here, but...

07:17.771 --> 07:20.297
What would you
say this room is?
300 square feet? 320?

07:20.740 --> 07:23.175
Three-twenty,
just free-balling it.

07:23.677 --> 07:25.543
It's a little cramped.

07:26.146 --> 07:28.945
How many square
feet out there?
Seventeen, eighteen hundo?

07:29.015 --> 07:30.779
Oh, I think it's 18 hundo.

07:31.952 --> 07:33.284
GABE: Give or take.

07:33.753 --> 07:35.153
Sorry, gang.

07:35.255 --> 07:38.419
I thought my juggling stuff
was in the trunk of
my car, but it's not.

07:38.491 --> 07:40.653
Oh, no,
do you think
it was stolen?

07:40.727 --> 07:42.093
ANDY: I got you
covered, boss.

07:42.162 --> 07:44.859
Used to play with
the parabolas myself.

07:45.665 --> 07:48.328
Got some extra balls.
Hey! Oh! (CHUCKLES)

07:48.668 --> 07:52.662
Sorry, I never touch
another juggler's
instruments.

07:54.341 --> 07:56.810
You know, we're all here,
I've got the music cued.

07:56.876 --> 07:59.072
Why don't I just do my routine
without the juggling balls?

07:59.145 --> 08:00.545
(PAM LAUGHS)
(ROCK MUSIC PLAYS)

08:00.680 --> 08:03.912
Prepare to go
into the danger zone.

08:08.855 --> 08:10.881
Oh, wow,
you weren't kidding.
No, never.

08:12.258 --> 08:17.322
Can someone please
throw me a fifth ball?
If you dare.

08:18.898 --> 08:20.161
Incoming!

08:20.800 --> 08:21.824
And we're on.

08:22.969 --> 08:25.336
Remember,
nothing's impossible.

Phyllis, where's Phyllis?

08:41.554 --> 08:42.578
Here.

08:43.990 --> 08:45.219
Do you believe
in me, Phyllis?

08:45.291 --> 08:46.987
Yes.
'Cause I believe in you.

08:47.060 --> 08:48.619
Oh, okay.

08:53.066 --> 08:54.056
Feel that connection?

08:55.101 --> 08:58.094
Don't move your head,
please, thank you.

09:00.340 --> 09:02.138
Big hand for Phyllis.

09:02.709 --> 09:03.938
That took a lot of guts.

09:11.985 --> 09:13.578
I'm Deangelo Vickers.

09:13.653 --> 09:15.679
Thank you so much.
Hope you learned something.

09:16.022 --> 09:17.217
(WHOOPING)

09:18.658 --> 09:21.287
He didn't drop
a single ball.

09:22.829 --> 09:23.819
Look.

09:24.064 --> 09:26.056
I'm juggling eggs
and bowling balls.

09:26.666 --> 09:28.100
I'm juggling with one hand.

09:29.102 --> 09:30.092
No hands.

09:31.905 --> 09:34.807
What could he
possibly stand to gain
from a fake juggling routine?

09:34.874 --> 09:38.208
What could he
possibly stand to gain
from a real juggling routine?

09:38.278 --> 09:40.110
How can you
keep defending him?

09:40.246 --> 09:42.442
He's good at his job,
and I like working for him.

09:42.515 --> 09:45.212
Of course you do, Jim.
You're a man.

09:45.652 --> 09:47.553
Deangelo is a huge sexist.

09:47.620 --> 09:48.918
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

09:48.988 --> 09:51.480
I think if he was sexist,
I'd be able to tell.

09:51.691 --> 09:54.058
I took a crap load
of women's studies
courses at Cornell.

09:54.494 --> 09:56.793
And I wrote my
own companion piece
to <i>The Vagina Monologues,</i>

09:56.863 --> 09:59.628
called <i>The Penis Apologies.</i>
So I know a thing or two.

09:59.699 --> 10:00.928
Okay, then how about

10:01.000 --> 10:02.628
I'm the head of
the accounting department,

10:02.702 --> 10:04.603
but he only ever
talks to Kevin.

10:04.671 --> 10:07.163
What about Pam and Kelly?
Also department heads,

10:07.240 --> 10:08.833
but has he ever
met with you?

10:08.908 --> 10:10.672
Or even asked you
to do anything?

10:15.381 --> 10:17.213
How could I not see it?
You're so right.

10:17.417 --> 10:18.885
Why don't you
talk to him about it?

10:18.952 --> 10:22.081
And say what?
"Hey, Deangelo, are you shy
or just a sexist?"

10:22.188 --> 10:24.453
Why don't you just tell him
how his actions
are being perceived

10:24.524 --> 10:25.856
by the women
in this office?

10:25.925 --> 10:26.915
Mmm-hmm.

10:27.393 --> 10:30.989
And if he doesn't listen,
then he can kiss
his penis goodbye.

10:31.264 --> 10:33.324
Snip-snip.
Am I right, girls?

10:35.034 --> 10:37.060
Hey, you got a second?

10:37.303 --> 10:39.795
Yeah, I got tons of time,
this job's a joke.

10:39.873 --> 10:40.863
So what's up?

10:42.575 --> 10:45.602
Really, it's nothing.
I was just talking
to Angela.

10:45.879 --> 10:46.869
And she was...

10:47.247 --> 10:49.739
Hey. Saw Jim come in,
are we meeting?

10:49.949 --> 10:51.645
Yeah, sure,
let's make it a meeting.

10:51.718 --> 10:53.050
If it's all right,
can I just have, like,

10:53.186 --> 10:54.518
one minute alone,
just to go over...

10:54.587 --> 10:57.455
What's the big secret?
Why are you even whispering?

10:57.524 --> 10:58.958
Come on, it's the guys.

10:59.092 --> 11:00.560
I know, just the guys.

11:01.027 --> 11:04.191
Well, maybe that's
part of the problem,
I think.

11:04.464 --> 11:07.434
So what happened was
I was talking to some of
the department heads.

11:07.500 --> 11:08.968
Right.

11:09.102 --> 11:11.230
Some of the female
department heads.
Uh-oh.

11:11.337 --> 11:12.327
Yeah.
JIM: Right?

11:12.405 --> 11:15.000
Hot.
Maybe there's
a vibe out there

11:15.441 --> 11:17.205
with certain members
of the office

11:17.277 --> 11:22.648
that you are
a little sexist, or...

11:22.916 --> 11:24.748
Damn!
Whoa!

11:24.817 --> 11:27.912
Wait.
Are you serious?
Who feels this way?

11:28.855 --> 11:31.188
Oh, like, nobody,
it was...
Pam?

11:31.257 --> 11:32.418
Was it Pam?
KEVIN: Oh, my gosh.

11:32.492 --> 11:34.654
That sounds like Pam.
You know how she gets.

11:34.727 --> 11:37.526
Deangelo,
she can get really bitchy.

11:38.198 --> 11:39.860
KEVIN: (IMITATING PAM)
Kevin...
DEANGELO: Guys.

11:40.033 --> 11:42.559
Hold on.
Doesn't matter who, okay?

11:43.469 --> 11:45.370
I'm just happy
that Jim brought it
to my attention,

11:45.438 --> 11:47.373
because, honestly,
I had no idea.

11:48.174 --> 11:49.938
That's awesome.
Thank you.

11:50.310 --> 11:52.905
Mom, Ryan's taking us
out to dinner tonight.

11:52.979 --> 11:55.813
No, no,
he's not gonna stand us up
like he did last time.

11:55.882 --> 11:57.578
He won't ever
stand us up again.

11:57.650 --> 12:00.017
So I am the new
Customer Service
supervisor...

12:00.086 --> 12:01.782
When Deangelo's around.

12:02.922 --> 12:06.188
And I'm also a very
dutiful boyfriend when...

12:06.259 --> 12:08.626
All the time.
All the time.

12:09.062 --> 12:11.497
Erin, do you mind
running down to the lobby

12:11.564 --> 12:13.999
and bringing up my brand new
executive assistant?

12:14.133 --> 12:15.863
Absolutely.
Hey, who'd you
end up hiring?

12:16.402 --> 12:17.461
I'm glad you asked, Jim.

12:18.171 --> 12:19.730
Because, apparently,
there's a rumor

12:19.806 --> 12:21.468
running around here
that I'm a sexist.

12:21.741 --> 12:22.868
Mmm-hmm.

12:22.976 --> 12:27.380
I can't work here
effectively if you guys think
I'm something that I'm not.

12:27.447 --> 12:28.574
I'm not a sexist.

12:30.350 --> 12:32.979
Raise your hand if
you have a vagina.

12:40.727 --> 12:43.993
Raise your hand
if someone you love
has a vagina.

12:44.897 --> 12:47.890
Yeah, yeah, okay.
Just about everyone.

12:48.701 --> 12:49.999
What about Deangelo's hand?

12:50.937 --> 12:53.702
Oh, wow.
He's got 'em both up.

12:54.974 --> 12:55.964
Yeah.

12:57.076 --> 12:58.066
Uh-huh.

12:58.745 --> 13:00.543
Yeah. So it bothers me,

13:01.481 --> 13:04.076
when I hear that
there's gossip around here

13:04.150 --> 13:06.176
that I treat women
lesser than men.

13:07.420 --> 13:08.615
Okay? Frankly,

13:09.055 --> 13:11.957
we all look
a little ridiculous
when that happens.

13:12.025 --> 13:13.391
I'm not a feminist,

13:13.760 --> 13:15.854
but I think that
the men in this office

13:15.928 --> 13:18.261
are being given chances
that the women aren't.

13:18.665 --> 13:19.655
Dwight.

13:20.366 --> 13:21.356
What's your take?

13:21.501 --> 13:22.491
What's the argument here?

13:22.568 --> 13:25.732
NBA, WNBA. One is a sport,
one is a joke.

13:26.005 --> 13:27.496
I love sports, I love jokes.

13:28.441 --> 13:30.467
Room for all.
Man, you're smart.

13:31.744 --> 13:34.475
Oh, hey! Hi. Hello.
Hi.

13:34.647 --> 13:39.779
Welcome. Everyone,
I'd like you to please
welcome Jordan Garfield.

13:41.120 --> 13:42.748
This is everyone.
Hello.

13:43.022 --> 13:45.253
So, Jordan,
where did you work before?

13:46.192 --> 13:47.216
A law office?

13:47.293 --> 13:48.283
No, Anthropologie.

13:49.495 --> 13:52.226
"We don't have
this and that size."
Pretty lame.

13:52.498 --> 13:54.592
Lame? You worked
at Anthropologie?

13:54.701 --> 13:56.329
Yeah.
That's, like,
my dream job.

13:56.402 --> 13:57.392
How did you even
get that job?

13:57.704 --> 13:59.434
Well, I...
You chose this job
over that job?

13:59.505 --> 14:01.030
Okay, okay,
back to work, Kelly.

14:01.107 --> 14:03.076
We have a lot to
get done today.

14:03.643 --> 14:06.738
So, is this your
first office job then?

14:07.180 --> 14:08.375
Yeah.
Yup.

14:08.915 --> 14:11.248
Wow.
No corporate
experience whatsoever.

14:11.517 --> 14:13.577
I didn't want anyone
with any bad habits.

14:13.653 --> 14:14.643
KEVIN: Nice.

14:16.956 --> 14:18.788
Jim, are you coming?

14:19.459 --> 14:21.291
Oh, yeah, did he text us?
KEVIN: Yeah.

14:25.365 --> 14:26.389
No!

14:28.134 --> 14:29.295
Jim, what are you doing?
Get in there.

14:29.469 --> 14:31.904
This is not
the time to take a stand,
at least he likes one of us.

14:31.971 --> 14:33.769
He didn't text me.
Yes!

14:34.540 --> 14:35.564
I'm in.

14:35.675 --> 14:37.303
Andy, what are you doing?

14:38.244 --> 14:40.804
I'm going in into
the belly of the beast.

14:41.381 --> 14:43.907
I'm gonna infiltrate
and change from within.

14:46.152 --> 14:47.484
What's up, man cave?

14:47.553 --> 14:48.543
(MAKING GRUNTING SOUNDS)

14:51.124 --> 14:52.592
Just go in.
Hmm?

14:52.825 --> 14:54.350
Just go in,
he probably just forgot
to text you.

14:54.727 --> 14:56.753
Internally for office use,

14:58.064 --> 14:59.965
where do we get
our paper from?

15:00.032 --> 15:01.159
Do we go and...

15:02.101 --> 15:03.125
Do we have that system?
Don't worry,

15:03.202 --> 15:04.226
the first day's
always the hardest.

15:04.370 --> 15:05.394
Yeah.

15:09.275 --> 15:10.368
Hey, Jim.
Yeah?

15:11.911 --> 15:13.174
Can I help you?
Nope.

15:14.447 --> 15:15.437
Just...

15:23.156 --> 15:24.146
Okay.

15:39.038 --> 15:41.974
So, he kicked you out
of the inner circle, huh?

15:42.041 --> 15:44.272
No, there is no
inner circle.

15:46.412 --> 15:47.402
Dwight?

15:47.814 --> 15:50.283
Deangelo wanted me to ask you
if there's anything
I could help you with?

15:50.616 --> 15:51.606
Really?

15:52.485 --> 15:53.475
Anything?

15:53.920 --> 15:55.286
Do you need anything?

15:55.488 --> 15:56.478
Deangelo?

15:56.823 --> 15:59.292
Tell your whore
to leave me alone!

16:00.860 --> 16:05.525
Okay, I do not
wanna waste your time,
so I will keep this brief!

16:05.965 --> 16:08.230
Now, word on the street
is Mercy Hospital,

16:08.801 --> 16:09.791
back on the market.

16:09.902 --> 16:12.428
Deangelo would like
you to put together
a sales pitch for next week.

16:12.572 --> 16:16.509
Deangelo has also
recently learned about
the Barnacle Project,

16:17.510 --> 16:20.036
which is
a non-profit organization
based in Mystic, Connecticut,

16:20.279 --> 16:22.544
that assists in
the scraping of barnacles...

16:22.648 --> 16:23.946
So this is my life

16:25.518 --> 16:26.611
until I win the lottery

16:29.155 --> 16:31.852
or Pam finally writes
that series of
young adult books.

16:32.191 --> 16:34.626
So, one afternoon
while walking
home from school,

16:34.694 --> 16:36.526
quirky 10th-grader
Becky Walters

16:36.662 --> 16:38.494
finds a wounded
Pegasus in the woods.

16:39.198 --> 16:42.225
And she becomes
"The Horse Flyer."

16:44.036 --> 16:45.698
Hey, Kelly,
that's the last time

16:45.771 --> 16:47.672
I'm gonna talk to you
about your paycheck, okay?

16:47.773 --> 16:50.368
We pay you a fair salary here
and if you're only here
for the money,

16:50.476 --> 16:51.842
maybe you shouldn't
be here at all.

16:51.911 --> 16:53.402
No one likes
a money grubber.

16:55.181 --> 16:59.312
I'm sorry, Mr. Howard.
I apologize for
grubbing for money...

16:59.785 --> 17:02.949
I can't do this.
I can't do this.
I'm sorry, I just can't do it.

17:03.022 --> 17:05.116
Deangelo,
Ryan is not my boss, okay?

17:05.191 --> 17:07.217
Frankly, he hasn't had
a real job here in years.

17:07.326 --> 17:08.419
Whoa!
(CHUCKLING)

17:08.861 --> 17:10.557
That's hilarious, Kelly.

17:10.695 --> 17:12.425
No, he's just
a big fraud, Deangelo.

17:12.498 --> 17:13.761
He's like Rango.

17:13.833 --> 17:15.425
He doesn't work here,
basically,

17:15.501 --> 17:17.766
just like the way
Rango didn't save
those animals.

17:17.837 --> 17:19.305
It was just a big
misunderstanding.

17:20.740 --> 17:21.935
Is this true, Ryan?

17:22.808 --> 17:23.901
I did not see <i>Rango.</i>

17:24.443 --> 17:26.674
Okay,
I don't have time for this
"he said, she said."

17:26.746 --> 17:27.941
He's not saying anything!

17:28.013 --> 17:29.004
It's too murky.

17:29.849 --> 17:33.183
I like Ryan.
You seem kind of
hysterical to me.

17:34.253 --> 17:36.882
Ryan's your supervisor.
Let's just leave it that way.

17:36.956 --> 17:39.551
But it's not fair.
I've been working here
for such a long time...

17:40.259 --> 17:41.249
(SIGHS)

17:41.427 --> 17:42.417
Close call.

17:42.795 --> 17:45.094
Okay, why don't you
just finish this stuff up
and leave it on my desk

17:45.164 --> 17:47.030
and I will see
you at your place
around 2:00 a.m.?

17:49.802 --> 17:51.293
(ALL CHEERING LOUDLY)

17:56.442 --> 17:59.105
DEANGELO:
Oh, angry, angry dunk.

17:59.312 --> 18:00.302
Hey.

18:00.379 --> 18:02.007
It sounds like you guys
are having a lot of fun,

18:02.081 --> 18:05.074
but it's really loud
and some of us are
trying to work, so...

18:05.151 --> 18:07.017
Do you think
you could do it
a little more quietly?

18:07.119 --> 18:09.816
Well, that's gonna
be tough because we're
getting a dunking clinic

18:09.889 --> 18:11.380
from Magic Jordan himself.

18:12.158 --> 18:13.854
You mean Michael Jordan?

18:16.662 --> 18:17.686
Total brain burp.

18:17.763 --> 18:18.753
I'm no MJ.

18:19.398 --> 18:20.388
Please.

18:20.499 --> 18:22.968
I can do his dunk
from free-throw line,
though.

18:23.035 --> 18:24.025
Whoa!

18:25.204 --> 18:28.697
Damn!
Mad respect
from a brother!

18:28.941 --> 18:32.878
The man is paying me
to take Chinese.
I will say what I need to say.

18:32.945 --> 18:35.881
And soon,
I will say it in Chinese.

18:37.016 --> 18:38.450
Okay, well,
it's just really loud.

18:38.818 --> 18:41.378
Okay. We'll keep that
in mind.

18:41.687 --> 18:43.883
All right, ladies.
Back to the game.
Do it!

18:44.924 --> 18:47.291
And, Jim, come on in.

18:48.461 --> 18:49.451
You're back in.

18:51.998 --> 18:55.332
You know what?
Instead of a game,
why don't we do an exhibition?

18:55.401 --> 18:56.664
Love to see
that dunk of yours.

18:57.903 --> 18:58.893
Yeah, we'll set that up
one day.

18:59.405 --> 19:00.737
Today. Now, maybe.

19:01.040 --> 19:02.474
'Cause we have
a hoop downstairs,

19:02.541 --> 19:04.567
and a real ball,
so you don't have
to mime it.

19:06.078 --> 19:07.239
Yeah, I don't know.

19:07.747 --> 19:08.737
Why not?

19:09.181 --> 19:10.740
Only because

19:10.816 --> 19:13.342
no one has called NASA
to request a lift off.

19:14.053 --> 19:15.043
(GUYS EXCLAIMING)

19:15.388 --> 19:17.687
Let's go downstairs, okay?
Let's do it.

19:17.757 --> 19:18.747
Pass.

19:19.291 --> 19:20.725
If I wanted to see
a pissing contest,

19:20.860 --> 19:22.294
I'd lock Mose in
the chicken coop.

19:22.528 --> 19:23.996
Damn it, Dwight, enough!

19:24.797 --> 19:28.859
Get your ass downstairs,
or find a new place
to sell paper!

19:32.071 --> 19:33.164
DWIGHT: <i>Okay,</i>
<i>a little about me.</i>

19:35.708 --> 19:37.870
I respond to
strong leadership.

19:39.078 --> 19:40.671
All right, there you go.
Seems a little close.

19:40.746 --> 19:41.907
You're sure that's
the real foul line?

19:42.048 --> 19:43.209
Fifteen feet
from the baseline.

19:43.282 --> 19:45.080
So you need me
to move it in?

19:45.384 --> 19:46.977
Nah, that's 15.

19:47.053 --> 19:48.043
Yeah.
Okay.

19:48.187 --> 19:50.520
And, you know what,
to make it interesting,

19:50.589 --> 19:52.785
Jordan, why don't you sit
underneath the basket?

19:52.892 --> 19:54.656
Seriously?
Yeah, come on.

19:54.827 --> 19:56.386
I'll dunk over you,
best seat in the house.

19:56.629 --> 19:57.756
I don't...
I don't think
I can do that.

19:58.097 --> 19:59.121
I'm holding your jewelry.

19:59.265 --> 20:00.324
Right, yeah.

20:00.766 --> 20:02.496
Okay, fair enough.
Kevin, you do it.

20:02.768 --> 20:03.758
Yes, okay.

20:03.903 --> 20:04.927
Why don't you?

20:05.004 --> 20:05.994
Here?

20:06.605 --> 20:07.595
Someone wanna
sit in Kevin's lap?

20:07.673 --> 20:08.697
Angela?
No.

20:08.774 --> 20:10.174
Oscar?
No, thank you.

20:10.309 --> 20:12.904
Okay, Jimmy, this is for you,
to show you that
anything is possible.

20:12.978 --> 20:14.344
Fantastic.
All right?

20:14.413 --> 20:16.473
Yup.
This is also for the troops.

20:25.658 --> 20:26.648
