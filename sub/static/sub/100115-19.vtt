WEBVTT

00:05.005 --> 00:06.745
[Jughead]
Forget art imitating life.

00:06.789 --> 00:09.966
Here we had a case
of art imitating death.

00:10.010 --> 00:11.663
The snuff film
that showed Jason Blossom

00:11.707 --> 00:13.752
being murdered
by dear old dad...

00:13.796 --> 00:15.145
[gunshot on video]

00:15.189 --> 00:16.407
...in a bizarre
recreation of it.

00:18.235 --> 00:21.238
Months of static shots
of houses, now this.

00:21.282 --> 00:23.197
Why change the pattern?

00:23.240 --> 00:28.898
Our Voyeur is trying
to recreate himself
into an auteur.

00:28.941 --> 00:32.815
No longer satisfied
with merely documenting
our daily lives, it seems.

00:32.858 --> 00:35.557
Between this tape and the one
of Betty killing me,

00:35.600 --> 00:39.256
it seems like he's trying
to painstakingly
recreate our deaths.

00:39.300 --> 00:40.953
Or near deaths.

00:40.997 --> 00:43.260
He's trying to blur the line
between fact and fiction.

00:44.174 --> 00:45.784
Is it a warning?

00:45.828 --> 00:48.091
-Could be a rehearsal.
-For what?

00:48.135 --> 00:50.137
An actual murder.

00:50.180 --> 00:54.097
So our auteur got a copy
of the Jason Blossom
murder video and then...

00:54.141 --> 00:56.665
pulls a Gus Van Sant
and tries to remake it?

00:56.708 --> 00:58.449
Where did he get
the original video though?

00:58.493 --> 01:00.060
Blue Velvet Video.

01:00.103 --> 01:01.583
Is there anything else
we can do at this point?

01:02.888 --> 01:05.152
Wait for another tape.

01:05.194 --> 01:08.198
Keep going through the videos
that we confiscated
from the Scarlet Suite.

01:08.242 --> 01:10.505
Okay, well,
I'm gonna have to let
you two fellows handle that

01:10.548 --> 01:13.290
because I have to finish
proofing the yearbook tonight.

01:13.334 --> 01:15.336
The most high school thing
you've ever said.

01:18.513 --> 01:19.383
[Betty sighs]

01:19.427 --> 01:21.124
Here it is, Mr. Honey.

01:21.168 --> 01:23.866
Riverdale High's yearbook
as requested.

01:23.909 --> 01:26.173
There will be no yearbook
this year, Ms. Cooper.

01:27.304 --> 01:29.176
Sorry, what? Why?

01:29.219 --> 01:31.308
The deadline for the printers
was two days ago.

01:33.441 --> 01:35.225
Yes, but I called the printers

01:35.269 --> 01:36.966
and they said if we give it
to them this afternoon,

01:37.009 --> 01:38.924
the yearbooks would be ready
by graduation.

01:38.968 --> 01:43.581
Yes, but I told you that
I would need to approve
every page.

01:43.625 --> 01:47.063
And I will not
be able to do that
by this afternoon.

01:47.107 --> 01:49.805
I pulled all-nighters
to get this done

01:49.848 --> 01:51.981
and because I'm two days late,

01:52.024 --> 01:53.765
you're punishing
all of my classmates?

01:53.809 --> 01:55.158
How is that fair?

01:55.202 --> 01:56.290
I'm sorry, Ms. Cooper,

01:57.465 --> 01:58.814
but my decision is final.

02:12.436 --> 02:14.656
[cell phone ringing]

02:18.573 --> 02:20.531
-Hello?
-[woman] Is this
Forsythe Pendleton Jones?

02:21.967 --> 02:23.186
Depends who's asking.

02:23.230 --> 02:25.014
My name is Dina Letum.

02:25.057 --> 02:27.669
I'm the admissions coordinator at the University of Iowa.

02:27.712 --> 02:29.714
Do you have a moment to talk about your application?

02:30.715 --> 02:32.195
Breaking news, everybody.

02:32.239 --> 02:34.066
So the University of Iowa

02:34.110 --> 02:35.285
has one of the best
writing programs
in the country.

02:35.329 --> 02:37.157
I applied for spring,

02:37.200 --> 02:39.594
but then they told me
they could take me
as early as fall.

02:39.637 --> 02:40.725
You're a good writer, bro.

02:41.552 --> 02:43.206
Wait.

02:43.250 --> 02:44.599
So this acceptance
is conditional?

02:44.642 --> 02:47.384
Yeah. They require
additional materials,

02:47.428 --> 02:49.430
which means
I need another story.

02:49.473 --> 02:51.780
But this could be
my redemption after that whole
Stonewall hell.

02:51.823 --> 02:53.434
The only problem is

02:53.477 --> 02:55.871
the well of my creative
unconscious is tapped out.

02:55.914 --> 02:58.874
Well, you could write
a monster story
about Mr. Honey.

03:01.659 --> 03:03.357
I am proud
of you though, Jug.

03:03.400 --> 03:05.968
What did he do?

03:06.011 --> 03:08.797
Honey is refusing to publish
the yearbook.

03:10.102 --> 03:11.495
Our legacy.

03:11.539 --> 03:14.194
The written record
of our last four years.

03:14.237 --> 03:18.894
Our friendships, our loves,
clubs, dances.

03:18.937 --> 03:22.376
Bee, if it's about money,
I'm happy to help pay
for the printing.

03:22.419 --> 03:26.075
Thank you, Vee, but it's...
the principal of it.

03:26.118 --> 03:29.687
Mr. Honey has been on our case
since day one.

03:29.731 --> 03:33.474
Do you remember
when he threatened us
on our first day back?

03:33.517 --> 03:36.216
And how many of us
are already banned
from going to prom?

03:36.259 --> 03:39.088
Fangs, Reggie, Toni and I
are all banned
because of Ticklegate.

03:39.131 --> 03:41.003
And I'm out
because of that bogus

03:41.046 --> 03:43.266
quiz show cheating scandal.

03:43.310 --> 03:46.051
Lest we not forget
my transcendent rendition
of Cherry Bomb

03:46.095 --> 03:48.706
which got Veronica,
the Vixens and myself

03:48.750 --> 03:50.360
barred from the promenade.

03:50.404 --> 03:52.667
So, literally the only people
going to prom are...

03:52.710 --> 03:54.625
[snaps fingers]

03:54.669 --> 03:56.888
-You wanna go
to prom with me, Jug?
-Oh, I'd be honored.

03:56.932 --> 03:58.020
But I'm not putting out.

03:58.063 --> 03:59.717
Let the fan fiction begin.

03:59.761 --> 04:01.980
Cousin Betty,
I share your outrage.

04:02.024 --> 04:03.852
Something must be done
to stop this heinous villain.

04:03.895 --> 04:06.289
Like what? Every time
we make a move against him,

04:06.333 --> 04:08.291
he hits us back.

04:08.335 --> 04:10.293
He's not letting Archie
walk with the rest of us
at graduation.

04:10.337 --> 04:12.600
He's a fiend.

04:12.643 --> 04:15.211
Although, one thing that would
stop Mr. Honey...

04:16.690 --> 04:18.214
is if we killed him.

04:24.829 --> 04:27.919
Or scared him enough
to leave town.

04:27.963 --> 04:29.965
I mean, it would be so easy.

04:30.008 --> 04:32.054
Mr. Honey works late
on Tuesdays.

04:32.097 --> 04:33.969
He usually leaves around 9:00.

04:41.368 --> 04:42.717
Yeah, but wouldn't
he recognize us?

04:43.544 --> 04:44.893
Good point, Arch.

04:44.936 --> 04:47.635
Okay, let's say we wear
bunny masks

04:47.678 --> 04:49.506
and Stonewall Prep jackets.

04:52.683 --> 04:54.163
[Archie] I could sneak up
and knock him out.

04:54.206 --> 04:55.077
Take him down.

04:55.773 --> 04:57.775
[grunts]

04:57.819 --> 05:00.604
[Betty] Then we tie him up
and stuff him
into the trunk of a car.

05:02.606 --> 05:04.216
What do you say, Reggie?

05:04.260 --> 05:05.914
Can we borrow Bella for this?

05:05.957 --> 05:08.133
After the way Honey trashed her
on Halloween night?

05:08.177 --> 05:10.397
Bella! [gasps]

05:10.440 --> 05:12.355
What happened to my car?

05:12.399 --> 05:15.010
Such a shame when someone
disrespects your property,
isn't it?

05:15.619 --> 05:16.533
Hell yeah.

05:18.753 --> 05:20.668
[Reggie] Where the hell
do we take him?

05:20.711 --> 05:24.019
My family still owns
that cabin in Fox Forest.

05:24.062 --> 05:27.457
[Betty] Then we take him there
and make him think
he's gonna die.

05:27.501 --> 05:31.113
[Cheryl] And I know
just the way we can do that.

05:31.156 --> 05:35.291
Veronica, do you remember
when we maple-boarded
my monster of a mumsie?

05:36.205 --> 05:38.033
[Mr. Honey choking]

05:40.427 --> 05:42.124
[coughs]

05:42.167 --> 05:44.169
We're letting you go,

05:44.213 --> 05:47.172
but you're leaving town
tonight.

05:47.216 --> 05:49.653
And if you don't,
we'll keep doing this.

05:49.697 --> 05:51.829
And we won't stop
until you're dead.

05:51.873 --> 05:53.657
[panting] You're insane.

05:53.701 --> 05:56.312
Fine. More syrup please,
then we'll start
digging his grave.

05:56.356 --> 05:58.270
No, no, no.

05:58.314 --> 05:59.663
[struggling]

06:02.449 --> 06:04.755
At least that's one way
we could get our revenge.

06:06.670 --> 06:09.978
We could do that, for sure.

06:10.021 --> 06:15.375
Or we could pull off
a classic senior prank,

06:15.418 --> 06:18.639
the likes of which
will never be forgotten.

06:21.903 --> 06:23.252
[clicks tongue]

06:23.295 --> 06:25.341
And I've got just the one
for Mr. Honey.

06:26.386 --> 06:28.910
It's an oldie, but a goodie.

06:38.310 --> 06:40.008
[telephone ringing]

06:50.758 --> 06:53.021
Miss Bell,
could you come in here?

06:53.064 --> 06:54.152
Miss Bell!

07:15.826 --> 07:17.567
Looks like we won this round.

07:18.220 --> 07:19.656
Maybe.

07:19.700 --> 07:21.484
Though I still think
we should've killed him.

07:30.319 --> 07:31.712
[typing]

07:35.063 --> 07:39.371
Jug, what are you doing?

07:39.415 --> 07:41.591
I'm writing a new story
for Iowa.

07:41.635 --> 07:43.898
You gave me the idea actually.

07:43.941 --> 07:46.117
It's called
Killing Mr. Honey.

07:46.161 --> 07:47.510
Great title.

07:47.554 --> 07:49.469
It's perfect.
I get to write something

07:49.512 --> 07:51.427
for my Iowa submission
while simultaneously
working out

07:51.471 --> 07:53.603
our collective revenge fantasy
against Mr. Honey.

07:53.647 --> 07:55.736
[continues typing]

07:55.779 --> 07:57.477
I printed some pages
on your night table
if you wanna read.

08:07.312 --> 08:10.751
[Jughead] Kidnapping Mr. Honey
was supposed to be
a joke, a prank.

08:10.794 --> 08:13.841
Payback for how
he terrorized them
all year long.

08:15.407 --> 08:16.496
[Jughead]
Where are his glasses?

08:19.020 --> 08:20.630
[Archie] Crap, they must've
fallen along the way.

08:22.589 --> 08:24.416
[Jughead]
No one was supposed to die.

08:24.460 --> 08:26.984
I can barely see
without my glasses.

08:27.028 --> 08:29.944
So you might as well take
those ridiculous masks off.

08:29.987 --> 08:31.423
[Reggie] Shut the hell up.

08:31.467 --> 08:35.166
I know exactly who you are,
Mr. Mantle.

08:35.210 --> 08:38.386
Mr. Andrews and Mr. Jones.

08:38.429 --> 08:40.693
And clearly you've partnered
with Ms. Lodge,

08:40.736 --> 08:43.260
Ms. Blossom and of course...

08:44.915 --> 08:45.829
Ms. Cooper.

08:47.875 --> 08:49.050
[Archie] Yo, what the hell
are you doing?

08:49.093 --> 08:50.355
He said he knew
who we were.

08:50.399 --> 08:52.532
Actually,
I didn't know, Mr. Mantle.

08:52.575 --> 08:53.750
I suspected it.

08:53.794 --> 08:56.187
But thanks to
your stupidity,

08:56.231 --> 08:57.798
my suspicions
have been confirmed.

08:57.841 --> 09:01.410
Dude, he played you
like a cheap violin.

09:01.453 --> 09:03.020
You just blew our cover,
you idiot.

09:03.064 --> 09:06.546
[Mr. Honey laughs]

09:06.589 --> 09:09.244
You think that's funny?
[breathing heavily]

09:09.287 --> 09:10.506
You think
you're better than me?

09:12.769 --> 09:14.249
-Reggie!
-Hey, Reggie!

09:14.292 --> 09:16.120
Come on, come on.
Just stop it.

09:16.164 --> 09:18.253
-You're gonna kill him.
Stop it, Reggie.
-All right.

09:20.516 --> 09:21.517
[panting]

09:21.561 --> 09:24.346
Tell me, Mr. Mantle,

09:26.653 --> 09:28.219
is that what your father
does to you?

09:28.263 --> 09:30.091
[Archie] Hey, shut up!
Hey, Reggie!

09:30.134 --> 09:32.397
[Mr. Honey laughs]

09:35.662 --> 09:37.489
We're leaving you now,
Mr. Honey,

09:37.533 --> 09:40.144
but we'll be back soon.

09:40.188 --> 09:42.625
And you shut your damn mouth
or we're gonna let him back in.

09:46.455 --> 09:48.196
Wow, that's dark.

09:49.763 --> 09:50.764
Is it too dark?

09:51.721 --> 09:53.549
No, I love it.

09:55.551 --> 09:56.552
[message alert chimes]

09:58.598 --> 10:00.512
Well, duty calls.

10:00.556 --> 10:03.733
Charles wants us
to meet him at his office.

10:03.777 --> 10:05.213
Is there any way
you can take point on that?

10:05.256 --> 10:06.518
I wanna continue
working on this.

10:07.345 --> 10:09.739
Sure.

10:09.783 --> 10:12.133
[Jughead] Once Mr. Honey
was secure at the cabin,

10:12.176 --> 10:13.874
we took shifts watching him.

10:13.917 --> 10:15.223
Cheryl was up first.

10:18.705 --> 10:22.883
Have one of you found them?
My glasses?

10:22.926 --> 10:24.101
TBH, I don't know.

10:26.930 --> 10:28.845
It's not too late,
Ms. Blossom.

10:30.020 --> 10:31.892
You can make this right.

10:31.935 --> 10:33.633
We are making it right.

10:35.417 --> 10:36.853
By kidnapping me.

10:37.637 --> 10:39.203
[scoffs]

10:39.247 --> 10:40.640
How do you think this ends?

10:40.683 --> 10:42.293
Betty and Jughead have a plan.

10:44.818 --> 10:45.862
Huh.

10:47.690 --> 10:51.520
Well, I've never taken you
to be a follower.

10:55.872 --> 10:57.569
Yes. Well,

10:57.613 --> 11:00.007
you have given us something
we've never had before.

11:00.921 --> 11:02.400
A common enemy.

11:03.750 --> 11:06.361
You were cruel to me,
Mr. Honey.

11:06.404 --> 11:09.843
You barred me
and all of my Vixens from prom.

11:09.886 --> 11:12.672
You locked Ms. Appleyard
in her office.

11:12.715 --> 11:14.717
She had a panic attack
and quit.

11:14.761 --> 11:16.284
What was I supposed to do?

11:16.327 --> 11:17.851
[shouts] What am I
supposed to do now?

11:22.638 --> 11:23.639
Hmm.

11:26.294 --> 11:28.905
Agree to make a video...

11:28.949 --> 11:30.515
giving us permission
to go to prom

11:30.559 --> 11:34.302
and promising that you won't
punish us for this

11:34.345 --> 11:37.827
or anything ever again.

11:37.871 --> 11:40.482
Might I suggest
an alternative, Ms. Blossom?

11:43.572 --> 11:44.660
Release me.

11:45.400 --> 11:47.271
Call the police.

11:47.315 --> 11:48.751
Tell them it was a...

11:48.795 --> 11:50.753
it was a school prank
that went horribly awry.

11:50.797 --> 11:52.799
You'll be punished, of course.

11:55.366 --> 11:57.281
But at least your lives
won't be ruined.

12:00.589 --> 12:01.764
So you won't
make that video then?

12:06.116 --> 12:07.291
Absolutely not.

12:08.989 --> 12:10.947
Fine.

12:10.991 --> 12:12.601
Then it's your funeral,
Mr. Honey.

12:21.784 --> 12:24.047
Mrs. Klump received this new
videotape this morning.

12:25.483 --> 12:26.746
[woman screaming on screen]

12:26.789 --> 12:29.749
Oh, my God.
Another recreation?

12:29.792 --> 12:32.360
Where did you get
the actual footage?

12:32.403 --> 12:35.798
Finished going through
the videos that we confiscated
from Blue Velvet.

12:35.842 --> 12:37.582
Turns out Jason Blossom's
snuff film

12:37.626 --> 12:39.193
wasn't the only contraband
that David had.

12:39.236 --> 12:41.499
Where the hell
is he getting these from?

12:51.161 --> 12:54.904
[Jughead] Next, it was Archie
and Veronica's turn
to check on their captive.

12:54.948 --> 12:56.863
To see if he'd had
a change of heart.

12:56.906 --> 12:58.125
[door creaking]

13:05.523 --> 13:07.438
Mr. Honey. Mr. Honey.

13:08.657 --> 13:10.137
Does he have a pulse?

13:10.180 --> 13:12.182
Here, let me check.

13:13.749 --> 13:14.663
Is he okay?

13:15.577 --> 13:16.708
Is he alive?

13:19.146 --> 13:21.583
-[Mr. Honey] You're late.
-And you are?

13:21.626 --> 13:25.152
I'm Principal Weatherbee's
replacement, Mr. Honey.

13:25.195 --> 13:26.806
Things are gonna be different
this year.

13:26.849 --> 13:29.591
We'll have order, discipline.

13:31.680 --> 13:33.508
-Is he okay, is he alive?
-No.

13:34.901 --> 13:35.815
He's not.

13:37.164 --> 13:38.121
He's dead.

13:39.340 --> 13:40.732
RIP, Mr. Honey.

13:40.776 --> 13:41.733
[keyboard clacking]

13:43.910 --> 13:45.215
[rock music
playing on speakers]

13:46.869 --> 13:48.653
Brace yourselves, bitches.

13:48.697 --> 13:51.656
I just saw our most hated foe,
Honey, entering his office.

13:51.700 --> 13:53.441
Was his ass
still glued to his chair?

13:53.484 --> 13:55.008
[all chuckle]

13:55.051 --> 13:57.706
I heard they had to use
turpentine to unstick it.

13:57.749 --> 13:59.926
He was smelling
particularly odious.

14:01.014 --> 14:03.494
[speakers buzzing]

14:03.538 --> 14:06.280
Students of Riverdale High.

14:06.323 --> 14:08.891
Unless the person
or persons responsible

14:08.935 --> 14:13.635
for yesterday's
so-called prank
step forward,

14:13.678 --> 14:16.856
prom is officially cancelled.

14:19.902 --> 14:21.686
I knew it.

14:21.730 --> 14:23.471
I knew your juvenile antics
were going to end in tragedy.

14:23.514 --> 14:26.909
Turn thyself in, Reginald,
immediately.

14:26.953 --> 14:28.693
No way.

14:28.737 --> 14:31.479
I pranked Mr. Honey
on behalf of all of us.

14:31.522 --> 14:32.567
And for the record...

14:34.090 --> 14:35.744
I did not prank alone.

14:35.787 --> 14:38.486
Oh, God. And who would be
stupid enough to help you?

14:42.272 --> 14:44.318
-[Betty] Kevin.
-[Veronica] Archie!

14:44.361 --> 14:46.320
-What's the big deal?
-It's not like any of us
were allowed to go.

14:46.363 --> 14:48.322
We were going to crash it,
you dotty pole.

14:48.365 --> 14:49.889
Now there's nothing left
to crash.

14:49.932 --> 14:51.803
And I refuse to be
the only sitting president

14:51.847 --> 14:54.067
in the history
of Riverdale High
who didn't sponsor a prom.

14:54.110 --> 14:55.590
Okay, everyone chill.

14:55.633 --> 14:58.723
Reggie's not the enemy here.
Mr. Honey is.

14:58.767 --> 15:01.291
If we all turn against
each other now, we all lose.

15:01.335 --> 15:03.380
If we want the prom back,
we need to think strategically.

15:03.424 --> 15:05.078
Betty, what should we do?

15:07.819 --> 15:09.952
We research our enemy,

15:09.996 --> 15:13.651
determine if there are
any skeletons in his closet
we can exploit.

15:13.695 --> 15:14.914
I'll take point on that.

15:15.827 --> 15:17.655
In the meantime...

15:17.699 --> 15:18.918
Nobody panic.

15:20.267 --> 15:21.833
[all panting]

15:27.491 --> 15:29.406
I don't understand.

15:29.450 --> 15:31.017
I didn't even
hit him that hard.

15:31.060 --> 15:32.801
Why did you even have
to hit him at all, Reggie?

15:32.844 --> 15:34.237
You were the last one
to see him alive.

15:34.281 --> 15:36.674
I didn't do anything.

15:36.718 --> 15:38.328
He was fine when I left him.
He must've toppled over
in his chair or something.

15:38.372 --> 15:40.852
We wanted to scare Mr. Honey,
not kill him.

15:40.896 --> 15:41.766
Well, he's dead.

15:43.377 --> 15:44.682
There's no walking back
from it.

15:44.726 --> 15:46.249
Jug is right.
What's done is done.

15:46.293 --> 15:47.903
The only question is,

15:47.947 --> 15:50.645
are we going to let
this terrible accident,

15:50.688 --> 15:53.822
and yes, I am calling it
an accident, which it was,

15:53.865 --> 15:56.390
ruin our lives, our future?

15:56.433 --> 15:58.348
I hope not.

15:58.392 --> 15:59.828
I'm going
to Highsmith College.

16:01.047 --> 16:02.222
I'm going to Barnard.

16:02.265 --> 16:03.484
I'm going to Yale.

16:03.527 --> 16:04.920
I'm going to the Naval Academy.

16:04.964 --> 16:06.530
I'm trying to go
to the University of Iowa.

16:06.574 --> 16:08.968
And I'm going to Riverdale
Community College.

16:09.577 --> 16:10.534
Maybe.

16:12.319 --> 16:14.016
All right, then.

16:14.060 --> 16:16.497
Who here has experience
in getting rid of a dead body?

16:20.240 --> 16:23.939
The hell. Am I the only one
that hasn't gotten rid
of a dead body before?

16:23.983 --> 16:26.072
No time like the present, bro.

16:36.169 --> 16:38.171
You're not gonna believe this.

16:38.214 --> 16:40.564
I did some sleuthing
on our least favorite tyrant

16:40.608 --> 16:42.914
and it turns out
there's a pattern

16:42.958 --> 16:45.047
to his reign of terror.

16:45.091 --> 16:48.050
Honey has cancelled prom
at every high school
he's worked at.

16:48.094 --> 16:50.879
For different reasons,
but the end result
is always the same.

16:50.922 --> 16:54.752
Geez. He's like the Grinch
that stole prom.

16:54.796 --> 16:56.667
What are we gonna do
with this?

16:56.711 --> 16:59.061
We share this key information
with our troops

16:59.105 --> 17:01.629
and dispatch them
to the appropriate parties.

17:06.763 --> 17:08.069
Hi, honey. How was school?

17:08.114 --> 17:10.116
Well, Mom,
now that you mention it...

17:10.159 --> 17:12.161
Mr. Honey cancelled prom.

17:13.467 --> 17:15.077
That's not even
the worst of it.

17:15.121 --> 17:17.513
He's doing it out of spite.

17:17.558 --> 17:19.386
And look, I'm not one
for school dances,

17:19.429 --> 17:21.605
but this one means a lot.

17:21.648 --> 17:23.954
Nana, it's our senior year.

17:23.999 --> 17:26.088
And I for one did not suffer
for four years

17:26.132 --> 17:27.829
to have this
one magical night

17:27.872 --> 17:31.833
taken away by some
hateful he-shrew.

17:31.876 --> 17:34.096
This is like
a personal vendetta with him.

17:34.140 --> 17:36.316
We can't let Mr. Honey
take this away from us.

17:36.359 --> 17:38.361
Not after everything
we've been through.

17:38.405 --> 17:41.973
Mr. Jones, Mom,
we need this.

18:06.955 --> 18:08.304
[footsteps approaching]

18:11.133 --> 18:13.701
Mr. Honey.
As concerned parents,

18:13.744 --> 18:16.704
we are here to demand
that you reinstate prom

18:16.747 --> 18:18.314
and you re-invite
those students

18:18.358 --> 18:20.273
you so rudely barred
from attending.

18:20.316 --> 18:21.796
That won't be possible.

18:21.839 --> 18:24.146
You see it's my job
to prepare these students

18:24.190 --> 18:26.975
to be upstanding citizens
of the world,

18:27.018 --> 18:29.586
and their behavior
needs to reflect that.

18:29.630 --> 18:31.066
So far, it has not.

18:31.110 --> 18:32.981
Oh, I'll show you
some behavior.

18:33.024 --> 18:36.245
Mr. Honey, Mary Andrews here,
attorney-at-law.

18:36.289 --> 18:38.117
May I bring
to your attention

18:38.160 --> 18:41.250
the case of Murray et al vs. The Greendale School District?

18:41.294 --> 18:43.861
A small town principal
cancelled prom

18:43.905 --> 18:45.863
and parents of
said small town sued him

18:45.907 --> 18:48.039
for psychological damage,
and won.

18:48.083 --> 18:50.303
I'm a very
good lawyer, Mr. Honey.

18:50.346 --> 18:52.392
[Hiram] And might I add,
as the mayor of Riverdale,

18:52.435 --> 18:55.656
I have a direct line
to Governor Dooley
and the Board of Education.

18:55.699 --> 18:59.050
And I'd hate for them
to look into and possibly
revoke your credentials.

18:59.094 --> 19:01.009
And RIVW has been hungry

19:01.052 --> 19:03.272
for a gripping,
public interest story

19:03.316 --> 19:05.796
that would make
nationwide headlines.

19:05.840 --> 19:08.147
"Principal Cancels Prom
Out of Spite."

19:08.190 --> 19:10.236
I think would surely
fit the bill.

19:10.279 --> 19:11.454
[sighs]

19:11.498 --> 19:13.674
And what will you two
do to me?

19:13.717 --> 19:14.762
Oh, we're just the muscle.

19:15.850 --> 19:17.068
[Mr. Hiram scoffs]

19:18.592 --> 19:21.334
Well, I am sorry,
but my decision is final.

19:21.377 --> 19:24.250
Actually it's not.
As President of the PTA,

19:24.293 --> 19:27.035
I have a right to demand
a vote on this matter.

19:29.255 --> 19:31.213
Perhaps, if all of us,

19:31.257 --> 19:33.389
say over the age of 20,
would like to adjourn
to my office,

19:33.433 --> 19:35.913
we might discuss this
as adults.

19:35.957 --> 19:37.480
Yes, let's do that.

19:37.524 --> 19:40.135
And as student body president,
I'll be joining.

19:40.179 --> 19:41.005
Fine.

19:44.879 --> 19:46.881
[Jughead] And so the dragon
that had been terrorizing

19:46.924 --> 19:49.492
the halls of Riverdale High
was beaten.

19:49.536 --> 19:51.407
Vanquished.

19:51.451 --> 19:54.932
All that remained was giving it a proper burial.

19:54.976 --> 19:56.630
Hurry up!

19:56.673 --> 19:57.761
It's almost dawn.

19:59.110 --> 20:01.722
How deep does the grave
have to be?

20:01.765 --> 20:03.158
Deep. It's Riverdale.

20:10.426 --> 20:11.993
What's shocking is,
how many times

20:12.036 --> 20:14.778
have we said these very words
in real life?

20:14.822 --> 20:15.866
I know, isn't it chilling?

20:16.824 --> 20:18.956
Hobo. Bride of Hobo.

20:19.000 --> 20:21.350
As student body president,
I have an announcement to make.

20:21.394 --> 20:24.745
Although, I believe
this proclamation calls
for a more festive setting.

20:28.531 --> 20:30.141
[indistinct conversation]

20:34.145 --> 20:35.886
[clears throat]

20:35.930 --> 20:37.410
Classmates...

20:37.453 --> 20:39.586
Mothers, fathers...

20:39.629 --> 20:41.936
Nana...

20:41.979 --> 20:43.938
Prom is officially back on!

20:43.981 --> 20:46.245
[whooping]

20:50.510 --> 20:52.947
So, I'd like to propose
a toast.

20:52.990 --> 20:54.688
To generations united,

20:54.731 --> 20:56.994
together, we have proven
victorious.

20:57.995 --> 20:59.736
To all of us,

20:59.780 --> 21:01.999
and to a senior prom
we will never forget.

21:02.043 --> 21:04.437
[all] Yay! Cheers!

21:04.480 --> 21:07.135
And if I may speak
for the grown-ups.

21:07.178 --> 21:08.136
[man] Yup.

21:10.617 --> 21:13.446
We're just so very, very proud
of you.

21:13.489 --> 21:16.753
And the thoughtful, intelligent
young adults you've become.

21:16.797 --> 21:19.190
You kids have been through
a lot.

21:19.234 --> 21:22.019
Much more than we did,
when we were at Riverdale High.

21:22.063 --> 21:23.369
[mothers chuckling]

21:23.412 --> 21:24.544
[Hermione] And we may not
say it enough but,

21:24.587 --> 21:26.328
you mean the world to us.

21:26.372 --> 21:29.113
And, although it may not
always seem like it,

21:29.157 --> 21:31.681
we have your best interests
at heart.

21:31.725 --> 21:33.466
You worked hard,
you deserve to celebrate.

21:33.509 --> 21:37.383
My boy is gonna be
the first Jones man
to go to college.

21:37.426 --> 21:39.341
-Whoo!
-[all] Whoo!

21:47.610 --> 21:50.091
[Jughead] They were supposed
to feel relief,

21:50.134 --> 21:52.746
Honey was dead, and buried.

21:52.789 --> 21:55.923
And they'd gotten away with it. They were free.

21:55.966 --> 22:00.362
Free to go back to talking
about college and homework...
And prom...

22:00.406 --> 22:02.843
So, in terms of a theme
for prom...

22:02.886 --> 22:04.627
-[Betty] Hm?
-I was thinking,

22:04.671 --> 22:06.150
"Old Hollywood."

22:06.194 --> 22:08.370
I was going to suggest
F. Scott Fitzgerald,

22:08.414 --> 22:10.590
The Beautiful and Damned,
but,

22:10.633 --> 22:13.070
old Hollywood glamour
works as well.

22:13.114 --> 22:15.290
Now, how many limos
should we get?

22:15.334 --> 22:18.337
How can you talk about prom
and limos after what we did
last night?

22:18.380 --> 22:21.427
Hey, Reggie, shut the hell up
right now.

22:21.470 --> 22:23.690
All I'm saying is last night
was majorly messed up.

22:23.733 --> 22:26.127
-Reg...
-Guys, I was just
in the front office

22:26.170 --> 22:27.824
and I saw Ms. Bell talking
to the police.

22:27.868 --> 22:29.870
What? What were
they talking about?

22:29.913 --> 22:31.524
You know, how Principal Honey's
gone missing?

22:31.567 --> 22:34.788
Well, some Adventure Scouts
were camping in the woods,

22:34.831 --> 22:37.312
found a pair of glasses
that might belong to Mr. Honey.

22:37.356 --> 22:40.359
So now the police
are suspecting foul play.

22:40.402 --> 22:43.274
They're canceling class,
sending out a search party.
Should we go sign up?

22:54.460 --> 22:56.592
This is a great
complication, Jug.

22:56.636 --> 22:58.942
-You think so?
-Mmm-hmm.

22:58.986 --> 23:01.075
You don't think the Adventure
Scouts finding the glasses is
too contrived?

23:01.118 --> 23:04.513
Guys, I was in the office
right now, Mr. Honey
asked me to find you.

23:04.557 --> 23:06.820
Said he wanted to see you
ASAP.

23:06.863 --> 23:09.518
That's weird.

23:09.562 --> 23:10.824
[footsteps approaching]

23:10.867 --> 23:13.914
Charles. Mr. Honey.

23:13.957 --> 23:15.872
What's up, Chuck?

23:15.916 --> 23:18.484
Well, a videotape
was delivered to the school
this morning.

23:19.746 --> 23:21.878
I called Agent Smith,

23:21.922 --> 23:24.925
and he told me that
the two of you have been
helping him with his case.

23:26.840 --> 23:29.582
I thought you might want
to see this.

23:29.625 --> 23:33.020
Be warned,
it's extremely unsettling.

23:33.063 --> 23:34.151
[remote clicks]

23:36.937 --> 23:39.330
Now, it's just
the school's facade at first,

23:40.506 --> 23:41.768
but then...

23:46.512 --> 23:48.296
How long does this go on for?

23:48.339 --> 23:50.516
[Mr. Honey] Hours.

23:50.559 --> 23:53.040
Whoever shot this video
covered every inch
of the school.

23:53.083 --> 23:54.563
I mean, every hallway,
every classroom,

23:54.607 --> 23:56.435
the gym, the auditorium,
the locker rooms.

23:56.478 --> 23:57.784
But what
could it possibly mean?

23:58.872 --> 24:02.005
Because it feels like a...

24:02.049 --> 24:04.138
I don't know, a warning
or a...

24:04.181 --> 24:06.401
threat. Wouldn't you agree,
Agent Smith?

24:08.185 --> 24:10.231
That's one way
to interpret it, yes.

24:14.453 --> 24:15.541
Well, in that case,

24:18.021 --> 24:21.503
seems I have no other option
but to put the school
on high alert.

24:21.547 --> 24:24.158
And despite the PTA's wishes,
cancel prom.

24:24.201 --> 24:29.206
If this tape even suggests
the possibility of violence
against any of my students,

24:29.250 --> 24:31.905
every precaution
must be taken,

24:31.948 --> 24:33.863
including curbing
extra-curricular activities.

24:35.299 --> 24:37.519
Will you let
your friends know,

24:37.563 --> 24:39.478
while I alert your parents?

24:41.262 --> 24:42.350
Mmm-hmm.

24:53.753 --> 24:55.885
-This feels very wrong.
-Completely agree.

24:55.929 --> 24:57.974
We know that our guy
has moved on from
simple recordings

24:58.018 --> 25:00.716
and on to re-creations.
This tape feels like
he's backtracking.

25:00.760 --> 25:02.283
Or unless
he's revisiting themes.

25:02.326 --> 25:04.154
Or it could be a hoax.

25:04.198 --> 25:05.895
I mean, think about it,
the general public
does not know

25:05.939 --> 25:08.942
our Voyeur/auteur has moved on
to re-creations, right?

25:08.985 --> 25:11.118
-Correct.
-I'm following you, Jughead.

25:11.161 --> 25:13.294
So, if someone wanted
to pretend to be our auteur
and they didn't

25:13.337 --> 25:15.514
have the privileged information
that we do,

25:15.557 --> 25:18.473
they would have shot a video
exactly like the one
Mr. Honey was sent.

25:18.517 --> 25:20.910
It's not a coincidence.
Honey wants to cancel prom,

25:20.954 --> 25:24.000
he's conveniently sent a video
that gives him
the perfect excuse.

25:24.044 --> 25:26.873
Guys, unless we have
conclusive proof that
this videotape was made by

25:26.916 --> 25:29.136
someone other than
our original guy,

25:29.179 --> 25:30.964
Honey's well within his rights
to cancel prom.

25:31.007 --> 25:32.835
Well, can we borrow
a copy of Honey's tape?

25:32.879 --> 25:34.228
Sure. Why?

25:34.271 --> 25:36.360
So we can review
every second of it.

25:36.404 --> 25:39.625
No, you have a story to write.
I will watch the damn tape.
Let's go.

25:39.668 --> 25:41.844
[Jughead] And then,
without warning,

25:41.888 --> 25:44.804
their carefully constructed
plan began to unravel.

25:44.847 --> 25:46.675
Thanks to a guilt-ridden
Reggie.

25:46.719 --> 25:48.851
Hey, you know what I heard
about Honey?

25:48.895 --> 25:50.723
I heard he was hooking up
with a student,

25:50.766 --> 25:52.551
and got run out of town.

25:52.594 --> 25:55.162
Who cares?
Guy was a total perv.
Gave me the creeps.

25:55.205 --> 25:58.905
What are you saying?
What are you saying!

25:58.948 --> 26:00.080
That you're glad
that he's dead?

26:00.123 --> 26:02.038
Reggie, shut the hell up.

26:02.082 --> 26:04.084
No, that's not
what we're saying.

26:04.127 --> 26:06.434
Look, all I'm saying is
the guy was a total weirdo.

26:06.477 --> 26:09.002
If he ran off, who cares,
good riddance.

26:09.045 --> 26:10.830
He didn't run off.

26:13.659 --> 26:15.661
They found his glasses.

26:15.704 --> 26:16.879
What's your point?

26:16.923 --> 26:18.141
Dude, Reggie, I'm serious.

26:18.185 --> 26:21.971
Just that,
they found his glasses.

26:22.015 --> 26:24.626
But Honey will never be found
'cause he is--

26:24.670 --> 26:26.759
Shut up. Shut up.

26:28.499 --> 26:29.544
You don't know
what you're talking about.

26:39.859 --> 26:41.904
[breathing shakily]

26:45.865 --> 26:48.519
I'm ordering Chinese,
you want Lo Mein?

26:48.563 --> 26:50.696
Yup, and some fried
wontons, please.

26:50.739 --> 26:53.873
-Chicken or veggie?
-Oh, hell no.

26:58.921 --> 27:00.749
Charles.

27:08.801 --> 27:09.932
I think we got him.

27:13.719 --> 27:15.851
[door opens]

27:15.895 --> 27:20.160
Agent Smith, Ms. Cooper,
Mr. Jones. May I help you?

27:20.203 --> 27:22.466
Yes, you can tell us whether
or not this is you

27:22.510 --> 27:25.992
in the screengrab
from the video you received.

27:26.035 --> 27:29.212
[Charles] Is it you holding
the camera in that photo?

27:29.256 --> 27:32.128
I mean, it's only two frames
but it's enough
to nail your ass.

27:32.172 --> 27:35.001
If you're suggesting
that I'm sending videotapes
around town--

27:35.044 --> 27:37.220
No, not all the tapes,
just this one.

27:37.264 --> 27:41.224
You're a copycat, Mr. Honey,
and not a very good one.

27:41.268 --> 27:44.532
Using the Voyeur's MO
to ramp up
your personal feud

27:44.575 --> 27:45.968
against me and my friends?

27:46.012 --> 27:47.491
Feud?

27:47.535 --> 27:48.710
I...

27:48.754 --> 27:50.407
I've been trying
to protect you.

27:50.451 --> 27:52.453
The only person
we need protection from is you,

27:52.496 --> 27:54.020
Mr. Honey, you're deranged.

27:55.717 --> 27:57.545
I was trying to help you.

27:59.025 --> 28:01.331
To prepare you for a life
outside of Riverdale.

28:01.375 --> 28:03.377
You can justify
your actions all you want

28:03.420 --> 28:05.118
but we already sent
copies of the videos
to the school board,

28:05.161 --> 28:06.249
aka, our parents.

28:06.293 --> 28:08.904
So between them
and the FBI,

28:08.948 --> 28:10.210
I hope you have
a good lawyer.

28:11.777 --> 28:14.431
Guess that's checkmate,
Mr. Honey.

28:14.475 --> 28:15.998
Don't mess with us
in our own town.

28:18.000 --> 28:21.090
What causes a principal
to hate his students so much?

28:21.134 --> 28:22.875
Was he bullied
in high school?

28:22.918 --> 28:25.399
Is his entire career
based on revenge?

28:25.442 --> 28:26.835
Well, maybe he should've
had sessions

28:26.879 --> 28:29.969
with Mrs. Burble
along with the rest of us.

28:30.012 --> 28:31.840
At least now
you can finish your story

28:31.884 --> 28:33.929
without any
real-life interruptions.

28:33.973 --> 28:35.322
How close are you
to being done?

28:35.365 --> 28:36.932
Oh, close.
Reggie just died.

28:38.412 --> 28:40.066
Reggie?
Why did Reggie have to die?

28:48.291 --> 28:50.598
[Cheryl crying]

29:06.092 --> 29:07.528
It's not right.

29:07.571 --> 29:09.356
[sobbing] Reggie didn't
deserve that.

29:09.399 --> 29:11.924
Well, of course
he didn't deserve it, Cheryl.

29:11.967 --> 29:13.229
You need to get
ahold of yourself.

29:13.273 --> 29:15.057
Do you understand me?

29:15.101 --> 29:17.799
It's very sad, tragic even,
what happened to Reggie,

29:17.843 --> 29:19.540
but he was out of control.

29:19.583 --> 29:21.760
He couldn't handle himself
when Mr. Honey died.

29:21.803 --> 29:24.240
Died? Are you serious?

29:24.284 --> 29:26.416
Jughead's right, Cheryl.

29:26.460 --> 29:27.853
Reggie was spiraling.

29:27.896 --> 29:29.071
He was drinking.

29:30.551 --> 29:32.422
-Tell her, Arch.
-Yeah.

29:32.466 --> 29:33.902
If hadn't been in
the locker room that time,

29:33.946 --> 29:35.034
I don't know what
he would've said.

29:35.077 --> 29:36.513
[sobbing]

29:36.557 --> 29:38.777
Fine, but did we
have to cut his brakes?

29:38.820 --> 29:40.779
I mean,
we murdered out friend.

29:40.822 --> 29:42.519
What are you
talking about, Vee?

29:44.783 --> 29:47.960
We didn't
cut Reggie's brakes.

29:49.135 --> 29:50.745
His death was an accident.

29:52.312 --> 29:53.835
[chuckles]

29:53.879 --> 29:56.446
The truth is he was never
taking care of that car

29:56.490 --> 29:58.187
the way he should've.

29:58.231 --> 29:59.928
-Eventually it just
caught up with him.
-[crying]

29:59.972 --> 30:01.974
We can't change what happened.

30:02.017 --> 30:04.890
The only thing we can do
is live our lives.

30:04.933 --> 30:07.631
Wow.
Are you hearing
yourselves?

30:07.675 --> 30:09.764
It's like you actually
believe this crap.

30:09.808 --> 30:13.159
Ronnie, two people
are dead right now. Dead.

30:13.202 --> 30:14.464
And right now
the world thinks

30:14.508 --> 30:15.857
that Reggie died
from a car accident.

30:15.901 --> 30:17.337
A horrible car accident.

30:18.425 --> 30:20.557
So this ends...

30:20.601 --> 30:23.212
right now,
if we all just
stick together.

30:25.388 --> 30:27.390
-Will you do that for me?
-My God.

30:28.827 --> 30:31.351
I knew Betty and Jughead
had a dark streak,

30:31.394 --> 30:34.180
but when did you become
such a monster, Archiekins?

30:34.223 --> 30:38.227
[scoffs] Come on.
Don't kid yourself, Veronica.

30:38.271 --> 30:40.012
In this town
we're all monsters.

30:40.055 --> 30:42.971
We've always been monsters,
and that includes you, too.

30:43.015 --> 30:46.148
The question is,
are we going to be
monsters in college...

30:47.280 --> 30:48.629
or in jail?

30:48.672 --> 30:49.760
[Cheryl cries softly]

30:56.289 --> 30:58.117
Wow.

30:58.160 --> 31:00.815
So we're the monsters.

31:00.859 --> 31:03.644
I kinda just go wherever
the story leads me.

31:03.687 --> 31:05.211
But don't worry I'm gonna
change all of our names

31:05.254 --> 31:08.127
before I submit it
to the University of Iowa.

31:08.170 --> 31:12.871
So no one is going to know
the perverted truth
about us... but us.

31:14.960 --> 31:16.744
So, what happens next?

31:16.787 --> 31:18.615
Do Veronica and Cheryl
go to the police,

31:18.659 --> 31:21.792
or does your teen angst
body count increase by two?

31:21.836 --> 31:23.229
I honestly
don't even know yet.

31:23.272 --> 31:25.231
I'm still trying to
decide between some

31:25.274 --> 31:28.060
-cautionary morality tale
and a nihilistic dark comedy.
-Mmm.

31:28.103 --> 31:31.628
Guys, dead man walking.
Hallway, right now.

31:31.672 --> 31:32.847
That was fast.

31:56.001 --> 31:58.525
Well, Mr. Honey,
looks like the good guys won.

32:01.484 --> 32:03.269
[chuckles cynically]

32:03.312 --> 32:05.532
Is that what you think
happened here?

32:05.575 --> 32:07.795
Well, you're leaving
and we're staying,

32:07.838 --> 32:09.492
so yeah,
I'd mark that as a win.

32:10.145 --> 32:11.059
Hmm.

32:13.148 --> 32:15.455
I stand by everything
that I've done.

32:17.022 --> 32:17.979
Including the videotape.

32:19.415 --> 32:22.027
Everything that
I have done...

32:22.070 --> 32:25.030
is to make this school
better, safer,

32:25.073 --> 32:27.075
for you and
your classmates.

32:27.119 --> 32:29.295
Because what goes on
around here,

32:29.338 --> 32:31.819
murder, mayhem, depravity...

32:32.863 --> 32:34.474
it is not normal.

32:38.957 --> 32:40.915
Well, it's normal to us.

32:40.959 --> 32:43.222
Which is why
we had to stop you.

32:43.265 --> 32:45.876
[scoffs] Stop me.

32:45.920 --> 32:48.140
Ms. Cooper...

32:48.183 --> 32:50.011
I saw the writing
on the wall days ago

32:50.055 --> 32:51.621
and I lined up my next job.

32:53.101 --> 32:57.018
I am Stonewall Prep's
new headmaster.

32:57.062 --> 33:00.804
It seems they cleaned house
and were in need of a...

33:00.848 --> 33:03.024
strong leader to help them
rebuild their reputation.

33:06.288 --> 33:08.247
And my salary, it's...

33:08.290 --> 33:10.031
triple what I've been
making here.

33:24.437 --> 33:26.961
All right, you know what?
Screw Mr. Honey.

33:27.005 --> 33:28.658
-He sucks.
-[Veronica]
That's right, Archiekins.

33:28.702 --> 33:30.095
I mean, who doctors up

33:30.138 --> 33:32.053
fake evidence just to
cancel prom?

33:32.097 --> 33:34.142
And takes away
a school's yearbook?

33:34.186 --> 33:35.361
Censors a variety show.

33:35.404 --> 33:37.276
A psycho, that's who.

33:37.319 --> 33:42.281
That man is anything but.

33:42.324 --> 33:46.111
I have been working in that
front office for 50 years.

33:46.154 --> 33:47.764
And in all that time,

33:47.808 --> 33:51.377
I have outlasted
eight principals.

33:51.420 --> 33:53.727
And beyond a doubt,

33:53.770 --> 33:56.512
the best, by far...

33:56.556 --> 33:58.427
was Mr. Honey.

33:59.820 --> 34:01.213
Poor Miss Bell,

34:01.256 --> 34:02.910
you've fallen under
the monster's spell.

34:02.953 --> 34:04.564
[scoffs]

34:04.607 --> 34:07.915
Do any of you have any idea

34:07.958 --> 34:10.831
what that man has done
for this school?

34:12.833 --> 34:14.574
This year alone,

34:14.617 --> 34:17.489
he personally arranged for
six low-income students

34:17.533 --> 34:20.667
to go to colleges
on full scholarships.

34:20.710 --> 34:22.451
Wait, really?

34:22.495 --> 34:25.367
Also, this year's
average GPA

34:25.411 --> 34:27.935
is higher than
it's been in decades.

34:27.978 --> 34:30.416
And more seniors
will be going to college

34:30.458 --> 34:34.855
than have since 1956.

34:34.898 --> 34:37.466
Oh, and of course, no students
have died under his watch.

34:40.382 --> 34:42.080
He asked me
to mail this for you.

34:43.472 --> 34:45.692
But I don't think I will.

34:45.735 --> 34:47.563
You may wanna
read it though

34:47.607 --> 34:50.436
to fully comprehend
your actions.

34:57.182 --> 34:58.008
What is it, Jug?

35:01.055 --> 35:03.623
It's a letter
written by Mr. Honey
to the University of Iowa.

35:16.549 --> 35:17.854
Are you gonna open it?

35:22.250 --> 35:25.079
Look, it can't be worse than
whatever you're imagining.

35:51.105 --> 35:53.194
What did Mr. Honey say?

35:53.238 --> 35:54.282
Was he trying to
screw you over?

35:54.326 --> 35:55.675
Oh, my God.

35:58.243 --> 36:00.201
-I have to change it.
-Change what?

36:00.245 --> 36:01.594
My story, I have to fix it.

36:07.034 --> 36:09.297
[Jughead] The problem with
believing you have
all the answers,

36:09.341 --> 36:12.126
is that is blinds you
to the truth that's
right before your eyes.

36:12.170 --> 36:13.258
[door creaking]

36:19.916 --> 36:20.874
Mr. Honey.

36:21.483 --> 36:23.137
[typing]

36:23.181 --> 36:25.095
Ronnie, what do we do?

36:25.139 --> 36:26.532
Call 911.

36:26.575 --> 36:28.969
-No if we do that--
-If we don't, he'll die.

36:29.012 --> 36:32.015
Call 911. I'll give him CPR.

36:32.059 --> 36:33.843
[typing]

36:35.497 --> 36:37.107
Uh, yeah.
We need an ambulance.

36:47.509 --> 36:49.163
What the hell happened?

36:49.207 --> 36:50.817
It's okay. The doctors said
Honey's gonna make it.

36:50.860 --> 36:52.558
No, I'm more worried
about us.

36:52.601 --> 36:55.213
Okay. What do the police know?
What did you tell them?

36:55.256 --> 36:56.953
The truth.

36:56.997 --> 36:58.868
That this all started
as some stupid prank

36:58.912 --> 37:00.435
and that things
got out of hand.

37:00.479 --> 37:02.524
A prank? Do you realize
what you've done?

37:02.568 --> 37:04.831
Yeah, we kept a man
from dying.

37:04.874 --> 37:06.920
And ruined our lives.

37:06.963 --> 37:08.835
Reggie's right, you guys just
wrecked everything,
our futures,

37:08.878 --> 37:10.402
now none of us
are gonna go to college.

37:10.445 --> 37:12.534
Who cares about college?
Don't you guys understand

37:12.578 --> 37:14.536
that we could spend
the next 20 years of our lives
in Shankshaw--

37:16.059 --> 37:17.235
Shankshaw prison?

37:17.278 --> 37:19.324
Are you listening
to yourselves?

37:19.367 --> 37:21.326
Mr. Honey could've died.

37:21.369 --> 37:23.023
We would've been murderers.

37:23.066 --> 37:26.418
Better that than what's
coming next for all of us.

37:26.461 --> 37:28.811
You don't mean that, Betty,
do you?

37:28.855 --> 37:31.031
That you would've preferred
Mr. Honey to die?

37:34.077 --> 37:35.296
[Betty]
What made you rewrite it?

37:37.342 --> 37:39.082
Guess I finally realized
what I was saying,

37:39.126 --> 37:40.127
how I was saying it.

37:42.216 --> 37:46.133
I've been reveling in
this town's sickness
and I was...

37:46.176 --> 37:49.049
enjoying the suffering
of another person,

37:49.092 --> 37:50.572
even if it was Mr. Honey.

37:53.140 --> 37:55.664
This is about
Mr. Honey's letter.

37:55.708 --> 37:56.796
Isn't it?

37:59.668 --> 38:01.104
What does he say in it?

38:01.148 --> 38:02.584
Hey, guys.

38:02.628 --> 38:06.762
Hey, Jellybean, uh,
now is not the best time.

38:06.806 --> 38:08.329
Well, I'm sorry to interrupt,

38:08.373 --> 38:10.157
but this was
on our doorstep.

38:28.697 --> 38:30.264
More house shots?

38:31.874 --> 38:33.354
Maybe it's another copycat?

38:35.313 --> 38:37.837
-Maybe it's an invitation.
-Yeah, but where?

38:37.880 --> 38:39.795
That place doesn't even
look like it's in Riverdale.

38:39.839 --> 38:41.319
No, but I've seen
this place before.

38:45.279 --> 38:47.586
That's the cabin
where Veronica's mom
killed Sheriff Minetta.

38:47.629 --> 38:48.761
Where they had their affair.

38:51.241 --> 38:52.373
I'll go get my keys.

39:42.249 --> 39:43.511
What's that for?

39:45.731 --> 39:47.080
Look like a makeshift screen.

39:50.562 --> 39:52.868
This projector reminds me
of the one we used to have
at the drive-in.

39:54.304 --> 39:55.349
There's no film in it, though.

40:02.487 --> 40:03.313
Jug.

40:27.642 --> 40:29.470
[Mr. Honey]
Dear Headmaster Koontz,

40:29.514 --> 40:32.125
Greetings from Riverdale High.

40:32.168 --> 40:36.042
I wanted to follow up on our conversation with a short note.

40:36.085 --> 40:40.481
Though Jughead Jones has had
an incredibly difficult year,
as you know,

40:40.525 --> 40:43.484
and I've only interacted
with him a scant few times,

40:43.528 --> 40:45.486
he is a special kid,

40:45.530 --> 40:47.923
and a superb writer.

40:47.967 --> 40:49.621
But he needs a break.

40:49.664 --> 40:53.189
He needs good teachers
and a healthy environment,

40:53.233 --> 40:55.757
which I know
the University of Iowa
can provide.

40:55.801 --> 40:58.368
I don't say this lightly,

40:58.412 --> 41:00.675
but I do believe
Jughead Jones

41:00.719 --> 41:04.070
will be an important voice
of his generation.

41:04.113 --> 41:05.550
If you'd like to
discuss him further,

41:05.593 --> 41:07.029
please call me at any time.

41:08.204 --> 41:10.032
All my best to you and Edith.

41:10.076 --> 41:12.687
Sincerely, Holden Honey.
