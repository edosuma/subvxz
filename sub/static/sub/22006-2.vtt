WEBVTT

00:00.860 --> 00:04.762
Previously on SEAL Team...

00:04.800 --> 00:06.665
JASON: It doesn't matter
what Nate wanted.

00:06.700 --> 00:07.769
I made the call.

00:07.800 --> 00:10.132
RAY:
Where's that blood coming from?

00:10.170 --> 00:11.706
JULIE:
The fact that you refuse

00:11.740 --> 00:13.503
to talk about Nate's death
is telling me

00:13.540 --> 00:15.735
that's exactly what
we should be talking about.

00:15.780 --> 00:18.044
RA_Y: Nate's death
Isn't on you.

00:18.080 --> 00:20.514
I understand that since the
operation In December last year,

00:20.550 --> 00:22.541
you and your wife
have separated.

00:22.590 --> 00:24.046
RAY: You know he's
sleeping on our fold-out.

00:24.090 --> 00:26.217
_ AL_ANA:
I miss seeing you guys.

00:26.260 --> 00:27.511
Sucks that's the
way it works.

00:27.560 --> 00:28.709
And if any of us thought
there was even a chance

00:28.760 --> 00:30.159
you two weren't
gonna get past this,

00:30.190 --> 00:31.225
we'd all be taking it
pretty hard.

00:31.260 --> 00:32.454
Hey, Daddy.

00:32.500 --> 00:34.627
Be great if you could
come by one evening.

00:34.660 --> 00:35.752
Well, I don't
live there anymore,

00:35.800 --> 00:37.119
so it really
doesn't matter, right?

00:37.170 --> 00:40.162
(silenced gunshots)
Clear.

00:40.200 --> 00:42.566
I told you to stay
out of the tunnel, no?

00:42.610 --> 00:45.568
Until you graduate Green Team,
you're a member

00:45.610 --> 00:47.805
of Chalk 2, Alpha
Platoon, SEAL Team 3.
Damn right.

00:47.840 --> 00:50.570
JASON: The kid's not Tier One,
not yet.

01:35.220 --> 01:38.724
You're saying that Molly doesn't
want any of this stuff?

01:38.760 --> 01:43.390
She just... wants
to get rid of her whole...

01:43.430 --> 01:45.591
just everything here?

01:45.630 --> 01:47.598
That's what she says.

01:47.640 --> 01:50.359
She keeps telling me
to sell it all.

01:50.410 --> 01:52.230
Since Nate's death,

01:52.280 --> 01:55.306
Molly just wants a fresh
start with her family.

01:56.650 --> 01:58.845
Yeah, but there's
a lot of stuff here.

01:58.880 --> 02:01.440
I mean, I could tell her
to kiss my ass,

02:01.480 --> 02:02.811
find someone else
to sell the place.

02:10.360 --> 02:11.725
Tex-Mex. (chuckles)

02:11.760 --> 02:13.853
It's not a good idea.

02:13.900 --> 02:15.925
It's a great idea.

02:15.960 --> 02:17.564
Remember what
happened last time?

02:17.600 --> 02:19.192
Yeah, I do.

02:19.240 --> 02:21.663
Jason, it's too confusing.

02:21.700 --> 02:23.634
"Too confusing."
What, for the kids?

02:23.670 --> 02:25.558
For everyone.

02:26.740 --> 02:29.743
Look, that was
never our problem.

02:29.780 --> 02:32.772
Problem was I was never here.

02:32.820 --> 02:35.345
That was the problem, right?

02:35.380 --> 02:38.941
No, our problem is you're not
here even when you are here.

02:38.990 --> 02:41.686
Just checked out
all the time.

02:41.720 --> 02:43.585
Look, if we're taking a break,

02:43.630 --> 02:46.190
then we're taking a break
from all of it.

02:50.830 --> 02:53.435
(murmurs)

02:53.470 --> 02:55.461
(laughter)

02:56.770 --> 02:59.477
*

03:02.610 --> 03:04.441
NATE:
So, I hired a gardener.

03:04.480 --> 03:06.516
JASON: Nate Massey is hiring
another guy to mow his lawn.

03:06.550 --> 03:07.812
Say it's not so, please.

03:07.850 --> 03:08.817
Last deployment,

03:08.850 --> 03:09.817
Molly forgot to
put the eggshell

03:09.850 --> 03:10.942
in the soil like I told her.

03:10.990 --> 03:12.787
We had the worst fight that
we have ever had, okay?

03:12.820 --> 03:13.912
So I just figured,
you know what?

03:13.960 --> 03:15.712
Gardener is cheaper
than a divorce.

03:15.760 --> 03:19.753
*

03:24.630 --> 03:27.428
JASON:
So, Nate, Alana and I,

03:27.470 --> 03:29.700
we've been talking and we're
gonna live apart for a while.

03:31.740 --> 03:32.877
I'm sorry
to hear that, man.

03:33.810 --> 03:34.970
Yeah, yeah.

03:35.010 --> 03:36.807
You know what,
it is what it is, right?

03:36.850 --> 03:38.841
Should move in here.

03:38.880 --> 03:40.347
Move in here with me,

03:40.380 --> 03:42.314
spend a little quality time
with your godson.

03:42.350 --> 03:43.783
Godson I could deal with,

03:43.820 --> 03:45.287
but walking around
your eggshells, no, thank you.
(laughs)

03:45.320 --> 03:46.787
And, besides, do you think
Ray would really want me

03:46.820 --> 03:48.583
to live anywhere else
but his place?

03:51.460 --> 03:54.759
("Off the Ground"
by The Record Company playing)

03:54.800 --> 03:56.791
(helicopter blades whirring)

04:01.070 --> 04:04.904
* I gotta get myself
off the side of the road *

04:06.540 --> 04:10.601
* I gotta get myself up
off the side of the road *

04:12.050 --> 04:14.473
* Things are lookin' clear
as they've ever been *

04:14.520 --> 04:16.385
* Don't know how it'll end,
but I know where to begin *

04:16.420 --> 04:20.789
* Gotta get myself
off the side of the road *

04:21.920 --> 04:23.751
* I gotta quit lyin' to myself

04:23.790 --> 04:26.793
* And let the truth be told

04:26.830 --> 04:29.025
* I got to quit lyin'
to myself *

04:29.060 --> 04:31.767
* And let the truth be told

04:31.800 --> 04:34.860
* Again I woke up burned out
by the sun *

04:34.900 --> 04:37.403
* Tired of layin' still
so I'm movin' along *

04:37.440 --> 04:41.877
* Quit lyin' to myself
and let the truth be told *

04:41.910 --> 04:43.775
* Hey, hey, yes

04:43.810 --> 04:49.419
* Ooh-ooh... ooh-ooh

04:49.450 --> 04:54.808
* Hey, hey, I've gotta pick
myself up off the ground, yeah *

04:54.860 --> 04:59.729
* Ooh-ooh... ooh-ooh

04:59.760 --> 05:00.897
* Hey, hey

05:00.930 --> 05:04.866
* I've gotta pick myself up
off the ground, yeah... *

05:05.900 --> 05:08.892
(grunting)

05:08.940 --> 05:11.033
Got some wheels on you, Spenser.

05:11.070 --> 05:12.708
Good finish, Brian.

05:12.740 --> 05:14.708
All right, come on,
let's go. Finish it up.

05:14.740 --> 05:16.844
Got a big day
in front of us.

05:16.880 --> 05:18.905
* I've gotta pick myself up
off the ground. *

05:18.950 --> 05:23.910
DOCTOR:
Mm-hmm. Good movement.

05:23.950 --> 05:25.679
Ah, good heart sounds.

05:25.720 --> 05:26.982
I'm telling you, baby,
he's got my dad's height.

05:27.020 --> 05:28.817
You know,
he's got my dad's height.

05:28.860 --> 05:30.851
Remember, I told you my great
uncle, he backed up Willis Reed

05:30.890 --> 05:32.357
when he was with the Knicks?

05:32.400 --> 05:33.628
It might've been
my great, great uncle.

05:33.660 --> 05:34.797
I think it might ring a bell.

05:34.830 --> 05:35.819
The fluid volume
IS normal.

05:35.860 --> 05:38.988
Fetal position
is head down.

05:39.030 --> 05:40.998
Okay, Naima,
looking real good

05:41.040 --> 05:42.928
for four weeks out.

05:42.970 --> 05:44.858
What did we say? Was it the 29th
or something like that?

05:44.910 --> 05:46.400
Yeah, 29th.

05:46.440 --> 05:47.976
Well, baby gets
a vote, too.

05:48.010 --> 05:50.069
Sometimes they just do not
want to stay in there.

05:50.110 --> 05:53.375
But as far as him
gomg out of town?

05:53.420 --> 05:54.978
Yeah, what's your
duty schedule like?

05:55.020 --> 05:56.885
Unpredictable.

05:56.920 --> 05:59.047
What command did you
say you're with?

05:59.090 --> 06:01.581
Logistical support, was it?

06:01.620 --> 06:03.884
(phone beeps)

06:15.440 --> 06:19.035
Bye.
We got a big one.

06:19.070 --> 06:20.935
MANDY: You're looking
at satellite imagery

06:20.980 --> 06:23.847
of an abandoned hospital outside
al-Hool in northeastern Syria.

06:23.880 --> 06:25.575
Wait a second, I'm sorry,

06:25.610 --> 06:27.874
but there's a lot of tire tracks
there for abandoned, I'm saying.

06:27.920 --> 06:29.581
We believe
the Syrian Army is using it

06:29.620 --> 06:31.019
as a bioweapons factory.
. RAY;
Wait a minute.

06:31.050 --> 06:32.950
Weren't they only supposed
to be using mobile labs now?

06:32.990 --> 06:36.482
I'm sure you all remember Dr.
Lucien from our chem-bio desk.

06:36.530 --> 06:37.986
Oh, no, Dr. Death.

06:38.030 --> 06:39.998
Hi again, everybody.

06:40.030 --> 06:42.498
Our recent success IDing
and destroying mobile labs

06:42.530 --> 06:43.758
has convinced the Syrian regime

06:43.800 --> 06:45.529
to go back to using
static sites.

06:45.570 --> 06:47.162
And they're choosing hospitals

06:47.200 --> 06:49.065
because they think
we'll be afraid to bomb.

06:49.100 --> 06:51.034
DoD won't authorize a strike

06:51.070 --> 06:53.129
without definitive proof
that the site's being used

06:53.180 --> 06:55.501
for chemical weapons production.

06:55.540 --> 06:57.679
Okay, what does the DoD
consider "definitive proof"?

06:57.710 --> 06:59.041
Physical evidence.

06:59.080 --> 07:00.069
Samples?

07:00.120 --> 07:02.509
Gets better.

07:02.550 --> 07:04.916
So, a satellite passes
every seven hours,

07:04.950 --> 07:07.089
traverses the area for 12
seconds, takes srx photos.

07:07.120 --> 07:09.588
Three passes ago,
took these.

07:09.630 --> 07:11.484
Those black shapes are...
Dead cattle.

07:11.530 --> 07:14.499
JASON: Well, they definitely
had a leak, didn't they?

07:14.530 --> 07:16.521
MANDY: Heavy fighting
in the area last few days.

07:16.570 --> 07:18.959
We believe an errant shell
hit the stockpile.

07:19.000 --> 07:20.467
20 klicks; that's close.

07:20.500 --> 07:21.762
ERIC:
Yeah, we'll be monitoring

07:21.800 --> 07:23.461
the Syrian troop
movements best we can.

07:23.510 --> 07:24.761
Get you in and out in a hurry.

07:24.810 --> 07:26.107
How big is the guard force?

07:26.140 --> 07:27.107
LUCIEN:
Uh, so far, we make it

07:27.140 --> 07:29.131
a single six-man unit.

07:29.180 --> 07:31.102
You're telling me they got
a chemical weapons factory

07:31.150 --> 07:32.879
and there's only six
guys guarding it?

07:32.920 --> 07:35.480
Yeah, enough that they were
missed by the photo analyst.

07:35.520 --> 07:38.080
Not for the cows, we might never
have found the place.

07:38.120 --> 07:39.951
Best guess
what they were making?

07:39.990 --> 07:41.958
Based on the regime's history,
sarin or VX.

07:41.990 --> 07:43.855
One of those is the
bad ones, right?

07:43.890 --> 07:46.188
Uh, sarin is pretty
nasty stuff.

07:46.230 --> 07:48.653
Bucket full of it, kill every
man, woman on the planet.

07:48.700 --> 07:51.123
But you're probably
thinking about VX.

07:51.170 --> 07:52.797
It's widely regarded

07:52.840 --> 07:54.967
as the deadliest substance
man's ever created.

07:55.000 --> 07:57.002
So, we're gonna actually
have to handle this stuff?

08:00.310 --> 08:03.245
Right, and who says you
never take us anywhere nice?

08:15.120 --> 08:16.519
Look, we can't even
get a drone up.

08:16.560 --> 08:17.527
I'm just gonna assume
we can't chopper in.

08:17.560 --> 08:19.221
Russians are threatening
to shoot down anything

08:19.260 --> 08:20.989
_ that crosses
Into Syrian airspace.

08:24.930 --> 08:27.137
We jump in. HAHO.

08:27.170 --> 08:28.592
Oh, yeah. HAHO.

08:28.640 --> 08:30.005
We bail out in Iraqi airspace,

08:30.040 --> 08:31.302
then fly to the
target under canopy.

08:31.340 --> 08:33.729
That's right.
The problem is getting out.

08:33.780 --> 08:34.804
How far to the border?

08:34.840 --> 08:35.738
18 kilometers.

08:35.780 --> 08:37.600
What's the_ nearest
QUIck Reaction Force?

08:37.650 --> 08:40.141
Special Forces ODA working
with Peshmerga at the border.

08:40.180 --> 08:41.909
Great, it's easy.
Have them standing by.

08:41.950 --> 08:44.089
Once we secure the target, they
come and they pick us up. Boom.

08:44.120 --> 08:45.940
Hey, we've been seeing
Russian troops

08:45.990 --> 08:48.015
on the border areas, yeah?

08:48.060 --> 08:50.927
DoD will never authorize
any ground movement

08:50.960 --> 08:52.120
with the possibility
of Russian contact.

08:52.160 --> 08:53.798
DoD has no balls.

08:53.830 --> 08:55.923
MANDY: We could get you
local vehicles.
DAVIS: How many?

08:55.960 --> 08:57.222
I wouldn't count on
more than two or three.

08:57.270 --> 08:59.124
(whispering):
Two or three.

08:59.170 --> 09:00.865
It could work. We keep
our numbers small.
How many straps?

09:00.900 --> 09:02.162
Well, it's Syria,
so there's no BSO,

09:02.200 --> 09:03.337
there's no indig partners.

09:03.370 --> 09:06.009
Maybe two EODs
for the decontamination.

09:06.040 --> 09:08.577
You don't need a translator
'cause you got Ray and Trent.

09:08.610 --> 09:11.340
Okay, so, two EODs,
that's all we need.

09:11.380 --> 09:12.347
MANDY:
Yeah.
And him.

09:12.380 --> 09:14.575
What?

09:14.620 --> 09:18.010
It-It-It's not my idea,
I assure you.

09:18.050 --> 09:20.109
Another contribution from the
good-idea fairies at CENTCOM.

09:20.160 --> 09:21.616
MANDY:
We have no idea

09:21.660 --> 09:24.026
if that factory is still
actively contaminated.

09:24.060 --> 09:25.357
What, the Syrians
didn't clean it first?

09:25.390 --> 09:26.891
LUCIEN:
As far as we can tell,

09:26.930 --> 09:29.353
they just pulled their
"scientists" out

09:29.400 --> 09:32.369
and, uh, locked
the place down

09:32.400 --> 09:35.335
till they can
pacify the area.

09:35.370 --> 09:37.907
ADAM: All right,
listen up, Green Team.

09:37.940 --> 09:40.272
Time for the first
top five and bottom five

09:40.310 --> 09:42.039
of this year's
Selection and Training.

09:42.080 --> 09:44.742
Today you get
to judge each other.

09:44.780 --> 09:49.740
One side of your paper lists in
order the top five candidates

09:49.790 --> 09:51.712
of this_S_election
and Training class.

09:51.750 --> 09:53.308
On the other side
lists the bottom five.

09:53.360 --> 09:55.089
We'll tally the results.

09:55.120 --> 09:57.088
We'll post the bottom five
on the wall in the team room.

09:57.130 --> 10:00.258
Bottom man in the bottom five
will be immediately dropped

10:00.300 --> 10:02.723
from this Selection
and Training class.

10:02.770 --> 10:05.728
Questions?

10:05.770 --> 10:07.829
Yeah. How come you
don't post the top five?

10:07.870 --> 10:10.907
At the Tier One level,
top five candidates,

10:10.940 --> 10:14.933
just means you met
the expectation.

10:14.980 --> 10:18.074
Anything else is unsat.

10:18.110 --> 10:19.372
So-so guys in the top five,

10:19.410 --> 10:21.310
they don't even know
if they made the grade?

10:23.320 --> 10:25.185
End of this Selection
and Training,

10:25.220 --> 10:26.983
if you're still here

10:27.020 --> 10:28.419
to get drafted
into a Tier One squadron,

10:28.460 --> 10:31.281
then you know
you made the grade.

10:31.330 --> 10:34.026
Is that clear,
Mr. Spenser?

10:34.060 --> 10:35.652
Yeah.

10:42.370 --> 10:44.964
_ Got a little soft there
in your old age, huh, Mary?

10:45.010 --> 10:46.978
Meaning?
Meaning the Spenser kid
still has his teeth.

10:47.010 --> 10:48.432
Back in the day,

10:48.480 --> 10:50.300
you would've knocked 'em all the
way in the back of his throat.

10:50.350 --> 10:52.944
Yeah, kid's barely
halfway into Selection,

10:52.980 --> 10:55.448
already got the chance
to operate in an honest-to-God

10:55.480 --> 10:57.311
real-world mission
with Jason Hayes...
That's right.

10:57.350 --> 10:59.682
...the Bravo Team big dogs.
Damn straight. Cheers to that.

10:59.720 --> 11:02.109
He got to personally smoke
Abu Samir.

11:02.160 --> 11:04.720
Mm-hmm.
Make anyone coclq.

11:04.760 --> 11:06.079
Kid ain't cocky
because of what he's done,

11:06.130 --> 11:08.394
he's coclq because
his daddy's Ash Spenser.

11:08.430 --> 11:10.022
You read the book?

11:10.070 --> 11:12.698
You?

11:12.740 --> 11:13.934
No.

11:15.340 --> 11:16.807
Is nobody gonna ask
ifI read the book?

11:18.810 --> 11:21.233
Okay. Okay.

11:21.280 --> 11:24.147
All right.
(phones chiming)

11:24.180 --> 11:26.205
All right, look, hey.
Showtime.

11:26.250 --> 11:27.478
I'll tell you what, Ray.

11:27.520 --> 11:29.374
15 years in the Teams,
biggest regret

11:29.420 --> 11:31.149
is never being able to see
my babies born.

11:31.190 --> 11:32.748
What I recall
from my first time

11:32.790 --> 11:34.382
is that you didn't miss much.

11:34.420 --> 11:35.717
You're mostly there
to hold the ice chips.

11:35.760 --> 11:37.125
Right. Holding
ice chips, right?

11:37.160 --> 11:39.890
Look, all I'm saying is

11:39.930 --> 11:41.090
maybe you want to
sit this one out.

11:41.130 --> 11:42.427
I do not.

11:42.460 --> 11:44.269
We already talked
to the doctor this morning.

11:44.300 --> 11:45.892
Said we're on track for
the end of the month.

11:45.930 --> 11:47.739
And if it happens,

11:47.770 --> 11:49.260
Naima can get her mom
to hold the ice chips.

11:49.300 --> 11:50.460
JASON: You gotta hold
the ice chips.

11:50.510 --> 11:52.159
RAY: Nah, I will, I'll make it.

11:52.210 --> 11:55.270
I'm good to go, coach.
Put me in.

11:55.310 --> 11:57.175
Hey.

12:01.780 --> 12:04.886
SONNY: Since we're the only
tandem, we will go first.

12:04.920 --> 12:07.388
When this ramp opens up, we're
gonna shuffle forward like this.

12:07.420 --> 12:09.012
Okay?
Almost to the edge.

12:09.060 --> 12:10.755
Then I will tap
your shoulder twice.

12:10.790 --> 12:13.258
Tap, tap. All right?
Lean forward,

12:13.300 --> 12:15.188
and gravity's gonna
take it from there, okay?

12:15.230 --> 12:16.254
Okay.

12:16.300 --> 12:18.063
Doc, stay with me.

12:18.100 --> 12:20.034
What's that?
Oxygen.

12:20.070 --> 12:22.038
I thought this was
the oxygen.
No, this is
for pre-breathe.

12:22.070 --> 12:23.503
It's gonna give you a base
before you jump.

12:23.540 --> 12:25.906
Okay, look, we are jumping
almost two miles higher

12:25.940 --> 12:27.407
than the top
of Mount Everest.

12:27.440 --> 12:29.533
Right, you don't pre-breathe,
you run the risk of passing out,

12:29.580 --> 12:31.775
which means you lose
body position, start to spin,

12:31.810 --> 12:33.414
and that chute right there
is gonna wrap around us

12:33.450 --> 12:35.270
tighter than a cigarette roll.

12:35.320 --> 12:36.548
Hey, hey.
Look at me.

12:36.580 --> 12:39.447
Look at me. Relax.
Silver lining.

12:39.490 --> 12:40.855
If that were to happen to us,

12:40.890 --> 12:42.209
you and I are both
gonna be unconscious

12:42.260 --> 12:43.249
when we burn in.

12:43.290 --> 12:45.520
Okay?
That's a good thing.

12:45.560 --> 12:47.551
Let's do this.

12:47.600 --> 12:49.818
(quietly):
Sure.

13:05.580 --> 13:07.878
(whistles)
Let's go. Get up.

13:07.920 --> 13:09.478
Break down the pallet.

13:38.110 --> 13:40.908
(jump alarm sounding)

13:40.950 --> 13:42.918
(indistinct muffled shouting)

13:45.390 --> 13:47.381
(hydraulic lift whirring)

14:01.670 --> 14:02.932
You okay, Doc?

14:02.970 --> 14:04.460
Yeah, great.

14:04.510 --> 14:06.330
You're gonna be fine.

14:20.260 --> 14:23.149
*

14:46.080 --> 14:48.071
(music playing,
indistinct chatter)

14:55.520 --> 14:59.081
You know you don't have to carry
these guys anymore, right?

14:59.130 --> 15:01.257
What's that mean?

15:01.300 --> 15:03.962
It_mea_ns this isn't
white-Side anymore.

15:04.000 --> 15:06.127
All that "rah-rah,"
"team first" crap.

15:06.170 --> 15:08.365
Dude, this level, Tier One,

15:08.400 --> 15:10.334
these guys are looking
for all-stars.

15:10.370 --> 15:11.564
You saying I shouldn't
have stopped

15:11.610 --> 15:13.339
to help Big Country
up the wall?

15:13.380 --> 15:15.268
You know, these guys already
know that we're SEALs,

15:15.310 --> 15:17.449
we've seen combat,
been through BUD/S--

15:17.480 --> 15:19.345
we can act as part
of a boat crew.

15:19.380 --> 15:21.644
Well, they're looking for guys
who don't need that crew.

15:21.680 --> 15:24.387
I don't know, man.

15:24.420 --> 15:26.411
What I've seen here...

15:26.450 --> 15:28.554
no one's crazy about
guys flying solo.

15:28.590 --> 15:31.980
Look, I-I'm just trying
to give you my advice,

15:32.030 --> 15:33.429
all right-- you don't
have to take it.

15:33.460 --> 15:35.325
Well, we'll see tomorrow

15:35.360 --> 15:37.464
who's in the bottom five
or not.

15:37.500 --> 15:39.422
Okay.

15:39.470 --> 15:41.267
WOMAN:
Hey.

15:41.300 --> 15:43.609
CLAY: Holy Mother,
look at that.

15:43.640 --> 15:47.178
Hey, man, come on.
Give a brother a chance.

15:47.210 --> 15:49.633
Like I said, bro,
you got to keep up.

15:52.510 --> 15:54.375
I'm Clay.

15:54.420 --> 15:55.614
Stella.

15:55.650 --> 15:57.379
Stella?
Mm-hmm.

15:57.420 --> 15:58.978
(quietly, la Brando):
"Stella! Hey, Stella..."

15:59.020 --> 16:01.181
Wow, no one's ever
said that before.

16:01.220 --> 16:04.280
Come on, that doesn't
make it not fun.

16:04.330 --> 16:05.422
Do you even know what it's from?

16:05.460 --> 16:07.098
Yeah.

16:07.130 --> 16:10.566
I'm not sure I believe you.
Okay, bet me.

16:10.600 --> 16:12.568
I lose, I buy.
What year do you
think this is?

16:12.600 --> 16:14.261
Come on.

16:14.300 --> 16:16.188
Even in 2017, a guy's
got to be able

16:16.240 --> 16:18.299
to buy a drink without it
being considered a hate crime.

16:18.340 --> 16:22.231
I bet you can't
tell me one more line.

16:22.280 --> 16:24.271
And I bet you I can.
Hmm.

16:24.310 --> 16:26.540
But you know what?
I'm not going to.

16:26.580 --> 16:28.571
Exactly.

16:28.620 --> 16:30.713
You know, Oprah did
this episode once.

16:30.750 --> 16:33.583
The whole show it was
about prejudgment.

16:33.620 --> 16:35.554
I'm pretty sure
she was against it.

16:35.590 --> 16:38.081
I have students who
might characterize

16:38.130 --> 16:41.429
your hate-crime joke
itself as a microaggression.

16:41.460 --> 16:43.291
So, what, you're a teacher?

16:43.330 --> 16:45.560
A grad student.

16:45.600 --> 16:48.068
Hudson... Hudson State.
(clears throat)

16:48.100 --> 16:49.692
And speaking of which,
I have to lead a section

16:51.440 --> 16:53.408
I'll get it.

16:53.440 --> 16:55.271
No, no. You really think
I'm gonna let you
pay for my drink?

16:55.310 --> 16:56.732
(chuckles)
Why not? Feminism?

16:56.780 --> 16:59.271
Yeah, something like that.

16:59.310 --> 17:00.709
I thought the whole point
of feminism

17:00.750 --> 17:02.069
was the women were supposed
to be able to do

17:02.120 --> 17:03.109
whatever they want.

17:03.150 --> 17:05.380
Yes, and, you know,

17:05.420 --> 17:06.648
as much as I would like
to stay here

17:06.690 --> 17:08.282
and debate that definition,

17:08.320 --> 17:10.629
because I really never,
ever get tired

17:10.660 --> 17:14.152
of listening to good-looking,
20-something

17:14.200 --> 17:16.156
middle-class white guys
opining on the finer points

17:16.200 --> 17:18.418
of intersectional
gender theory,

17:18.470 --> 17:20.165
I have to teach
in the morning,

17:20.200 --> 17:22.668
just like I said.

17:22.700 --> 17:24.634
When can I see you again?

17:24.670 --> 17:28.401
You know my name, and
you know where I'm in school.

17:28.440 --> 17:29.634
If you are what I think
you are, you shouldn't have

17:29.680 --> 17:30.772
too much trouble finding me.

17:30.810 --> 17:33.244
You think I'm
Dog the Bounty Hunter?

17:33.280 --> 17:36.078
(chuckles)

17:36.120 --> 17:37.348
Hey, wait, wait, wait.
I thought you weren't gonna

17:37.390 --> 17:38.743
let me buy your drink.

17:38.790 --> 17:40.781
Did I say that?

17:40.820 --> 17:42.811
Yeah, I haven't bought my
own drinks since I was 16.

17:42.860 --> 17:45.624
I consider it
reparations.

17:45.660 --> 17:47.753
Not even carrying
my wallet.

17:47.800 --> 17:53.193
Relying on the "kindness
of strangers"?

17:53.240 --> 17:55.561
(chuckles)

17:57.810 --> 18:01.598
(breathing rapidly)

18:01.640 --> 18:04.370
Hey, I think making
these things breathable

18:04.410 --> 18:06.844
defeats the purpose.
You okay?

18:06.880 --> 18:08.848
If I'm a little nervous
about walking into a building

18:08.880 --> 18:10.279
full of spilled nerve agent,
I guess I'm in

18:10.320 --> 18:11.548
the wrong line of work, right?

18:11.590 --> 18:13.182
You're gonna be okay.

18:13.220 --> 18:14.756
JASON:
TOC, this is Bravo 1.

18:14.790 --> 18:16.280
We've reached our target.
We're about to engage.

18:16.320 --> 18:17.287
(over radio):
Got two guards outside

18:17.330 --> 18:18.558
the hospital.

18:18.590 --> 18:19.852
Good copy, Bravo 1.

18:19.890 --> 18:22.199
Any word on our Syrian friends?

18:22.230 --> 18:25.859
Negative. Still engaged
with the FSA 20 klicks out.

18:25.900 --> 18:27.197
Copy that.

18:27.240 --> 18:29.231
All right?

18:34.510 --> 18:35.772
Up right.

18:35.810 --> 18:37.801
Up left.

18:40.950 --> 18:42.747
JASON:
Three, two, one.

18:55.930 --> 18:57.898
(panﬁng)

19:27.900 --> 19:31.267
*

19:53.820 --> 19:56.414
(device trills)

19:56.460 --> 19:57.859
(beeps)

20:02.560 --> 20:04.323
(door creaks)

20:20.880 --> 20:22.768
(gunfire, man grunts)

20:22.820 --> 20:24.412
(glass breaking)

20:38.630 --> 20:40.939
(gunfire, man grunts)

21:05.030 --> 21:08.022
*

21:24.080 --> 21:26.640
(device beeping)

21:37.090 --> 21:38.921
JASON:
I got this, Ray.

22:07.960 --> 22:10.554
JASON:
This place took a hit.

22:14.560 --> 22:17.097
Clear.

22:25.870 --> 22:27.406
JASON:
All right, Doc, you're on.

22:29.080 --> 22:31.901
Dang. Looks like the shelling
tore up the stockpile

22:31.950 --> 22:33.918
more than we thought.

22:33.950 --> 22:37.488
I got to swab the apparatus now
to get our samples.

22:37.520 --> 22:38.589
What's that do to the timeline?

22:38.620 --> 22:39.917
Nothing good.

22:39.950 --> 22:41.759
Let's go, Doc. You got
to move. Let's go.

22:41.790 --> 22:43.724
Yeah.

22:57.000 --> 22:59.434
You want to tell me what in
the actual hell that was about?

22:59.470 --> 23:01.472
What the hell was
what about, huh?

23:01.510 --> 23:03.000
TOC, this is Bravo 1.

23:03.040 --> 23:04.746
We've secured the lab.

23:04.780 --> 23:06.008
Strap's gonna start
collecting samples.

23:06.050 --> 23:07.449
Roger, Bravo 1.

23:07.480 --> 23:08.970
We'll get those
indig vehicles in place

23:09.020 --> 23:10.009
for your exfil.

23:12.690 --> 23:14.089
Bravo 1, be advised,

23:14.120 --> 23:16.486
the last satellite pass appears
to show a change

23:16.520 --> 23:18.852
in the status of the engagement
to your east.

23:18.890 --> 23:21.859
FSA force is withdrawing at
speed, Syrian Army not pursuing.

23:21.900 --> 23:23.925
Guys, if they turn
and move on you, you'll have

23:23.970 --> 23:26.029
maybe 20 minutes to get out
of there before you're boxed in.

23:26.070 --> 23:27.059
Copy that, TOC.

23:27.100 --> 23:28.465
We'll be long gone by then.

23:28.500 --> 23:29.967
SONNY:
This is Bravo 4.

23:30.000 --> 23:31.865
Boss, we need you up
on second deck.

23:31.910 --> 23:34.504
Copy.

23:55.100 --> 23:57.091
(people coughing)

24:21.960 --> 24:24.178
Fadlak...

24:24.230 --> 24:26.221
Saeidna. ..

24:26.260 --> 24:29.093
Fadlak.

24:47.010 --> 24:49.513
Hey, kid, look,
look at this.

24:49.550 --> 24:50.949
Hold on to that, okay?

24:50.990 --> 24:52.844
Keep that safe, understand?

24:52.890 --> 24:54.858
All right?

24:54.890 --> 24:56.687
You're gonna be okay.

24:56.720 --> 24:57.982
All right?

24:58.030 --> 25:00.021
Be strong.

25:03.030 --> 25:04.998
All right, look,
as far as I can tell,

25:05.030 --> 25:06.019
the kid is saying
that the regime

25:06.070 --> 25:07.731
took their village from 1.5.

25:07.770 --> 25:09.533
They rounded them up
to work here.

25:09.570 --> 25:11.731
All right? Took the military-
age guys to join the fight,

25:11.770 --> 25:12.930
including his dad.

25:12.970 --> 25:14.039
Yeah, well, her husband, too.

25:14.080 --> 25:15.035
I mean,
she was pretty vague on it.

25:15.080 --> 25:17.139
Didn't seem like something
I should press on.

25:17.180 --> 25:20.047
How's he doing?
Man, his whole respiratory
system's compromised.

25:20.080 --> 25:22.173
Plus, if the paralysis
of his throat muscles continues,

25:22.220 --> 25:23.847
he's gonna drown
in his own spit.

25:23.890 --> 25:25.084
How much atropine you give him?
Two Syrettes.

25:25.120 --> 25:27.315
Okay, great. Make it three.
You sure?

25:27.350 --> 25:28.851
Might want to hang onto that
in case you get exposed.

25:28.890 --> 25:30.050
Make it three.

25:30.090 --> 25:32.024
Got a head count?
23 total.

25:32.060 --> 25:33.152
Seven kids.
They all exposed?

25:33.190 --> 25:34.259
Got to assume so.

25:34.300 --> 25:36.120
All right. Can we save them?
Some.

25:36.160 --> 25:37.559
I mean, maybe. But we got
to get them fully deconned

25:37.600 --> 25:39.158
and to a trauma center,
and even then...

25:39.200 --> 25:41.566
You have any idea what agent
we're dealing with?

25:41.600 --> 25:42.589
I don't know for sure
till Doc gets it in a lab,

25:42.640 --> 25:43.902
but my guess is VX.

25:43.940 --> 25:45.168
How long is it gonna
take to decon?

25:45.210 --> 25:47.166
Figure ten minutes each,
little less for the kids,

25:48.840 --> 25:50.808
Get at it, okay?
The sun rises in five hours,

25:50.850 --> 25:52.340
and when that happens,
I want to be somewhere else.

25:52.380 --> 25:53.870
Roger that.

25:53.920 --> 25:55.876
You know we invented VX, right?

25:55.920 --> 25:57.717
Sorry, what?
Yeah.

25:57.750 --> 25:59.012
Well, actually, to be fair,
the Brits did first.

25:59.050 --> 26:00.654
But they did it by mistake,

26:00.690 --> 26:01.884
and as soon as they
realized how toxic it was,

26:01.920 --> 26:03.114
they stopped
making it.

26:03.160 --> 26:05.355
A few years later, the US
Army goes into mass production.

26:05.390 --> 26:07.153
We're the good guys, right?

26:07.190 --> 26:08.953
You know what?
We are the good guys, Ray,

26:09.000 --> 26:10.888
because we're not actually
using this stuff.

26:12.730 --> 26:14.334
We got two indig cars, Jason.

26:14.370 --> 26:16.292
How we gonna get
these people out of here?

26:16.340 --> 26:19.332
That's my next call.

26:19.370 --> 26:21.338
ERIC:
Yes, sir, 23.

26:21.380 --> 26:23.803
Yeah, o-our guys
are using local vehicles,

26:23.850 --> 26:26.148
they don't have enough space.

26:26.180 --> 26:28.910
Yes, well, we'd like to request
some additional transpo

26:28.950 --> 26:31.339
from a Special Forces ODA
at the border, sir.

26:33.220 --> 26:36.758
Yes, sir, I realize that.

26:36.790 --> 26:39.827
Yes, sir, I understand,
but i-if you would just...

26:39.860 --> 26:41.657
Excuse me, sir.

26:41.700 --> 26:43.998
They predict they'll be done
with decon by 0400.

26:44.030 --> 26:45.167
That doesn't give
our guys much time

26:45.200 --> 26:48.237
to get back across
the border before sunrise.

26:48.270 --> 26:50.135
One thing to be
in that place when it's dark,

26:50.170 --> 26:51.762
when the bad guys
can't see 'em.

26:51.810 --> 26:53.835
They said that
they're gonna make it.

26:53.880 --> 26:55.404
Are we gonna get permission
to pull those people out

26:55.440 --> 26:56.737
once we decon them?

26:56.780 --> 26:59.044
Yeah, I'm working on it.

26:59.080 --> 27:02.777
Okay, sorry, sir, I was
receiving a field report.

27:02.820 --> 27:05.414
DoD would prefer no
US. boots on the ground

27:05.450 --> 27:07.953
in that whole section
of the country.

27:07.990 --> 27:10.117
CENTCOM colonel I spoke to
sounded like it was news to him

27:10.160 --> 27:11.855
our guys went in. You?

27:11.890 --> 27:13.380
Well, I was looking for units
already in the country

27:13.430 --> 27:15.159
that had enough vehicles
to help carry the people out.

27:15.200 --> 27:17.156
Well, right. It's easier
to get brass to sign off

27:17.200 --> 27:19.168
on getting Americans
out of Syria. Smart.

27:19.200 --> 27:21.395
Exactly, but nothing so far.

27:21.440 --> 27:23.328
JASON:
Sonny.

27:23.370 --> 27:24.962
Let's go. Take a break.

27:25.010 --> 27:26.102
I'm fine.

27:26.140 --> 27:28.028
Look, I got an estimated company
of Syrian Army regulars

27:28.080 --> 27:29.934
about 20 klicks away.

27:29.980 --> 27:34.770
That sun comes up, I'm gonna
need you frosty, all right?

27:34.820 --> 27:36.845
We're gonna be here
till sun comes up?

27:36.880 --> 27:38.882
(exhales)

27:40.820 --> 27:46.156
We're, uh, waiting on a ride for
those people downstairs, huh?

27:48.200 --> 27:50.191
I'd put the shooters
we have here with us

27:50.230 --> 27:53.688
against any other shooters
in the world, Jason.

27:53.740 --> 27:56.834
But that don't mean we
can hold off an army.

27:56.870 --> 27:58.167
Look, you do know what happens

27:58.210 --> 28:00.030
if we leave those people
downstairs, right?

28:00.070 --> 28:01.230
I know whatever
happens

28:01.280 --> 28:03.202
has been decided
a long time ago.

28:03.240 --> 28:04.343
Not their fault
they were born.

28:04.380 --> 28:05.802
It's not ours, either.

28:07.080 --> 28:09.412
You know you got
to be real careful

28:09.450 --> 28:12.442
deciding what's best
for somebody else's life.

28:14.320 --> 28:16.117
Now, say we do pull them out.

28:16.160 --> 28:19.049
Hand them off to Civil Affairs,
and then what?

28:19.090 --> 28:22.150
Ain't nobody repatriating them
in a war zone.

28:22.200 --> 28:24.122
If they're lucky,
they end up in Europe.

28:24.170 --> 28:26.991
Let's assume that the borders
aren't shut down by then.

28:27.030 --> 28:30.397
And if not, they will spend
the rest of their lives

28:30.440 --> 28:32.203
in a refugee camp.

28:32.240 --> 28:35.277
Right. You gonna say that
to those kids' faces downstairs?

28:36.840 --> 28:40.446
I ain't gonna look
at their faces.

28:46.350 --> 28:50.753
You know, we got a lot
of wolves in this world.

28:50.790 --> 28:52.382
A sheepdog's got his hands full

28:52.430 --> 28:55.319
trying to keep his
own flock safe.

28:56.900 --> 28:59.721
Got no vigilance
left for anyone else.

29:02.500 --> 29:04.502
Not a whole lot
of honor in that.

29:05.540 --> 29:07.098
(grunts)

29:07.140 --> 29:10.029
It is what it is.

29:18.250 --> 29:20.889
Bravo 1, this is TOC.
Bump to channel three.

29:20.920 --> 29:22.080
(radio crackles)

29:22.120 --> 29:23.189
Hey, look, I just got the call.

29:23.220 --> 29:24.357
Ray's baby's coming early.

29:24.390 --> 29:26.221
Wait a second, what's wrong?

29:26.260 --> 29:28.228
The fetal heartbeat's
a lot slower than they'd like.

29:28.260 --> 29:30.125
They're gonna have to do
an emergency C-section.

29:30.160 --> 29:33.061
Naima's getting prepped
for surgery as we speak.

29:33.100 --> 29:34.237
How is she?

29:34.270 --> 29:35.794
Not great at the moment.

29:35.840 --> 29:36.966
It's a tough thing

29:37.000 --> 29:38.069
to have to face on your own.

29:38.110 --> 29:39.862
Look, she's never alone.

29:39.910 --> 29:41.400
You know what I mean.

29:41.440 --> 29:44.375
(sighs, clears throat)

29:44.410 --> 29:46.844
You gonna tell Ray?

29:48.320 --> 29:51.118
Haven't decided yet.

29:52.620 --> 29:55.157
Okay, look, Blackburn didn't
want me to tell you.

29:55.190 --> 29:57.215
Wanted me to wait
till you got back.

29:57.260 --> 29:59.080
But you said that I should
always give you the data,

29:59.130 --> 30:00.950
then you'd decide
what to tell our guys.

30:01.000 --> 30:04.219
No, you did the right thing.

30:04.270 --> 30:06.989
Who did the right thing?

30:07.030 --> 30:08.839
Sitrep?

30:08.870 --> 30:11.236
Just finishing up
deconning the civilians.

30:11.270 --> 30:13.431
EODs are gonna move to the
lab, start setting charges.

30:13.470 --> 30:15.574
You ready to tell me
what happened downstairs?

30:15.610 --> 30:17.532
VVhen?

30:17.580 --> 30:20.845
Team leader is never first
through the door, brother.

30:22.350 --> 30:23.988
You're trying to make sure
I get back home in one piece

30:24.020 --> 30:25.180
for those ice chips, huh?

30:25.220 --> 30:27.984
ERIC:
Bravo 1, this is TOC.

30:28.020 --> 30:30.318
Something like that.

30:30.360 --> 30:33.079
Go for Bravo 1.

30:33.130 --> 30:34.427
Listen, we made our case.
I told the captain

30:34.460 --> 30:35.927
I believed we should
authorize you

30:35.960 --> 30:38.360
to evac the civilians.
I was overruled.

30:38.400 --> 30:40.129
Bravo 1, your
mission objectives

30:40.170 --> 30:42.593
remain unchanged:
collect the samples,

30:42.640 --> 30:44.267
destroy any stockpiles
and infrastructure

30:44.310 --> 30:47.609
and exfil all allied personnel.
Is that clear?

30:47.640 --> 30:50.200
So we're just gonna leave
these people here to die?

30:50.240 --> 30:52.640
Not leaving them any worse off
than if we hadn't shown up.

30:52.680 --> 30:54.648
I know it sucks,
but I have been on the net

30:54.680 --> 30:58.343
for hours, and nobody's gonna
authorize more American military

30:58.390 --> 31:00.278
across that border.

31:00.320 --> 31:03.016
Look, you're trying to tell me
that the Green Berets

31:03.060 --> 31:06.029
get a TIC call, that the DoD's
not gonna let them respond?

31:06.060 --> 31:07.482
I guess to answer that
for certain,

31:07.530 --> 31:11.193
we'd have to have troops
in contact with the enemy.

31:11.230 --> 31:13.221
Do we have troops in contact?

31:17.140 --> 31:18.562
Not yet.

31:28.980 --> 31:30.982
(people coughing)

31:38.360 --> 31:40.351
(labored breathing)

31:54.580 --> 31:56.536
(speaks Arabic)

31:56.580 --> 31:59.344
Shh.

32:09.360 --> 32:11.351
(grunts)

32:13.730 --> 32:15.357
JASON:
So, we completed our mission.

32:15.400 --> 32:17.027
As your ground commander,

32:17.060 --> 32:18.493
the only lawful order
I can give right now

32:18.530 --> 32:20.168
is for us to make exfil.

32:20.200 --> 32:22.168
But I'm not gonna
give that order.

32:22.200 --> 32:24.509
I'm also not gonna
give the order to stay.

32:24.540 --> 32:27.407
So anybody who wants to leave
can get in those cars downstairs

32:27.440 --> 32:29.374
and they can drive
straight for the border.

32:29.410 --> 32:31.503
I'm sure it'll be
a nice Sunday drive by now.

32:31.550 --> 32:34.519
The rest of us are gonna
stronghold this position

32:34.550 --> 32:37.371
against a very large enemy
coming our way.

32:37.420 --> 32:39.183
I expect,

32:42.590 --> 32:44.558
will respond to our TIC.

32:44.590 --> 32:46.649
Otherwise, if they don't,

32:46.690 --> 32:48.624
pretty sure we'll be overrun.

32:55.270 --> 32:57.738
You don't think
we became frogmen

32:57.770 --> 33:01.433
because we didn't secretly
all want to be Batman?

33:01.480 --> 33:04.108
Come on now.

33:04.150 --> 33:05.503
(chuckles)

33:13.320 --> 33:16.483
Well, you guys wouldn't miss me
in the fight, let's be honest.

33:16.520 --> 33:19.023
But I also know you
wouldn't send me alone,

33:19.060 --> 33:20.550
so instead of
having eight men here

33:20.590 --> 33:21.750
to hold off the descending
hordes of bad guys,

33:21.800 --> 33:23.529
you'd be down to, what?
Six? Maybe five?

33:23.560 --> 33:25.699
So, while I don't know

33:25.730 --> 33:28.290
if having to go through
the rest of my life

33:28.340 --> 33:29.762
haunted by your
faces-- not to mention

33:29.800 --> 33:31.358
those poor souls behind us--

33:31.410 --> 33:33.560
is a fate literally worse
than death,

33:33.610 --> 33:35.475
I also don't want to find out,
so I'm staying.

33:44.190 --> 33:45.714
Okay, so let's do this.
Two shooters on the roof.

33:45.750 --> 33:47.411
Three down below.
Let's get everybody away

33:47.450 --> 33:48.485
from the windows
in5ide, all right?

33:48.520 --> 33:50.408
Hey, Hale Storm, talk to me.

33:50.460 --> 33:52.382
How long is it gonna take you
to, uh, wire up that lab?

33:52.430 --> 33:54.159
20 minutes maybe.
Then I'll have to decon.

33:54.200 --> 33:56.555
Okay, well,
let's get on it. Move.

33:56.600 --> 33:57.749
You didn't really expect anybody

33:57.800 --> 33:59.529
to take you up on that offer,
did you?

33:59.570 --> 34:01.731
Oh, I was 50/50 on the doc
to be quite honest with you.

34:01.770 --> 34:03.499
(laughs)

34:03.540 --> 34:05.405
MANDY: Bravo 1, this is TOC.
Bad news, guys.

34:05.440 --> 34:07.635
You have massed enemy on the
move towards your position.

34:07.670 --> 34:10.639
Estimate they could be
less than 30 minutes out.

34:10.680 --> 34:13.205
How many "massed enemy"
are we talking about?

34:18.320 --> 34:20.743
Too many.

34:54.860 --> 34:57.784
I just love that feeling
when you're about to be shot at.

34:57.820 --> 34:59.253
Aanhere else you'd like to be?

34:59.290 --> 35:00.848
Hell no. (laughs)
JASON:
Uh-huh.

35:00.890 --> 35:02.790
HALE:
Bravo 1, this is EOD.

35:02.830 --> 35:04.525
Lab equipment is all detted up.
If you want to double-check

35:04.570 --> 35:06.788
Dr. Death has got everything he
needs 'cause once I blow this,

35:06.830 --> 35:09.367
we'll need to avoid this
whole side of the building.

35:09.400 --> 35:11.209
Copy, EOD. Wait, 1.

35:11.240 --> 35:12.764
Hey, Dr. Death. Luci.

35:12.810 --> 35:14.471
You got everything
you need?

35:14.510 --> 35:15.738
To prove the regime
was making nerve agent?
Yeah.

35:15.780 --> 35:17.702
Absolutely.

35:17.740 --> 35:20.277
I collected enough residue
to poison half the country.

35:20.310 --> 35:22.619
This was some leak. I'm amazed
they're not all dead,

35:22.650 --> 35:24.880
considering what they must've
taken into their bodies.

35:24.920 --> 35:26.740
I guess they got luclq.

35:44.810 --> 35:46.505
Let me ask you a question.
Do you think that the lab techs,

35:46.540 --> 35:47.802
they'd clean their equipment,
right?

35:47.840 --> 35:49.831
Yeah, I guess so.

35:49.880 --> 35:51.745
Wouldn't say I think
about it much.
Yeah, especially in a lab

35:51.780 --> 35:53.179
making the deadliest stuff
known to man.

35:53.210 --> 35:54.768
Created by.
Yeah, so?

35:54.820 --> 35:57.380
EOD, this is Bravo.
Hold on that demo.

35:57.420 --> 35:58.739
HALE:
Roger, 1. Waiting on you.

35:58.790 --> 35:59.688
RAY:
What are you thinking?

35:59.720 --> 36:01.881
TOC, this is Bravo 1,
we have a problem.

36:01.920 --> 36:04.184
Our chem guy is saying that
the samples he's collected

36:04.230 --> 36:06.858
are not gonna test positive
for a banned agent.

36:06.890 --> 36:08.551
He's thinking
they're possibly diluted.

36:08.600 --> 36:09.897
Please advise.

36:09.930 --> 36:10.589
ERIC:
Stand by, Bravo 1.

36:10.630 --> 36:13.394
Yes, sir.
Bravo 1 standing by.

36:13.430 --> 36:14.931
They need evidence this
place was making poison,

36:14.970 --> 36:16.369
and if we can't bring
them the samples...

36:16.400 --> 36:17.890
Then they're our evidence.

36:17.940 --> 36:19.407
Oh, that's good
stuff, Jason Hayes.

36:21.910 --> 36:23.537
Yes, sir.

36:23.580 --> 36:26.504
Sir, I am only relaying
the information.

36:26.550 --> 36:29.917
Not at all, sir. I know we're
all under a lot of pressure.

36:29.950 --> 36:32.589
(chuckles)
That's for sure.

36:32.620 --> 36:35.259
This better work.

36:35.290 --> 36:37.679
Yup.
MANDY;
As I was saying,

36:37.720 --> 36:39.381
our analyst on the ground
is certain

36:39.430 --> 36:41.955
some of the people were exposed,
but he's not confident

36:42.000 --> 36:43.524
he can identify which
without testing.

36:43.560 --> 36:45.721
_ In_a |a._..
in a lab Situation, yes.

36:45.770 --> 36:47.362
That's right.

36:47.400 --> 36:50.938
So, leaving any of them behind
would obviously risk...

36:50.970 --> 36:52.835
That's right.

36:57.310 --> 37:00.347
Lieutenant Comgjander Blackburn.
ir.

37:00.380 --> 37:02.439
Yes, sir.

37:02.480 --> 37:05.540
"Diluted"?

37:05.590 --> 37:07.615
I'm pretty sure you can
detect a single drop of VX

37:07.650 --> 37:08.856
in an Olympic swimming pool.

37:08.890 --> 37:10.687
Yup.

37:10.720 --> 37:12.881
Yes, sir.
23 of them should be

37:12.930 --> 37:15.797
more than enough evidence, sir.

37:15.830 --> 37:17.457
And, of course,
the human obligation.

37:17.500 --> 37:20.389
Couldn't agree more.

37:20.430 --> 37:21.931
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

37:25.540 --> 37:27.007
How many vehicles is he sending?

37:27.040 --> 37:28.632
That's beautiful.
Tell him I owe him one.

37:28.680 --> 37:29.669
Okay, listen up, everybody.

37:29.710 --> 37:30.870
The Green Berets are inbound,

37:30.910 --> 37:32.548
which means we got
to get everybody there

37:32.580 --> 37:34.411
out and ready to travel.

37:34.450 --> 37:36.839
The enemy is two kilometers out,
which means, hey,

37:36.880 --> 37:40.418
multiple vehicles, we got
to move now. Now, now, now.

37:49.460 --> 37:50.859
Let's go.

37:50.900 --> 37:53.698
Go, go, go, go.
Move, move, move, move, move.

37:53.730 --> 37:54.890
Move, move, move.
Let's go!

37:54.940 --> 37:57.898
Let's go. Move,
move. Move.

37:57.940 --> 37:59.635
Come on. Move, move.

37:59.670 --> 38:01.900
Bravo 1, we have Syrian troops
on the edge of town

38:01.940 --> 38:03.874
and advancing.
Let's go.
Move, move.

38:03.910 --> 38:04.945
Come on, move.

38:04.980 --> 38:07.005
(indistinct shouting)

38:07.050 --> 38:08.039
Go, go!

38:08.080 --> 38:09.809
Let's go,
move out, move out!

38:13.990 --> 38:15.855
I got you, I got you,
I got you. Hold on.

38:21.560 --> 38:23.699
Go, go, go! Go!

38:27.400 --> 38:28.958
Blow it! Blow it!

38:29.000 --> 38:30.490
Fire in the hole!

38:53.060 --> 38:54.084
(grunts)

38:58.100 --> 39:00.568
Hey.

39:14.080 --> 39:16.071
*

39:32.430 --> 39:34.432
Congrats, Ray.

39:37.640 --> 39:40.461
(laughs)

39:45.610 --> 39:47.942
Eight pounds, ten ounces.

39:47.980 --> 39:49.914
Gonna play him on the O-line.

39:49.950 --> 39:52.748
Slow heart rate thing?

39:52.790 --> 39:54.758
Oh, that's... cord got wrapped
around the neck. Happens.

39:54.790 --> 39:56.451
No worse for wear.

39:56.490 --> 39:57.957
How's Naima?

39:57.990 --> 39:59.480
She's tired, man.

39:59.530 --> 40:01.452
Says she feels like
someone cut her open

40:01.500 --> 40:05.095
and sewed her back together.

40:05.130 --> 40:06.995
You could have
told me, you know.

40:07.030 --> 40:09.863
Yeah, I know.

40:09.900 --> 40:14.132
I, um... understand
why you didn't.

40:14.170 --> 40:17.799
I know that, too.

40:24.520 --> 40:26.511
(helicopter whirs in distance)

40:36.200 --> 40:38.725
Hey, Clay.

40:43.770 --> 40:46.034
ADAM:
Could be worse, Spenser.

40:46.070 --> 40:48.209
At least you're still here.

41:12.830 --> 41:14.832
*

41:30.850 --> 41:32.818
Oh.

41:32.850 --> 41:34.852
Hey.

41:34.890 --> 41:36.209
Hi.

41:36.260 --> 41:38.251
How's it going?

41:38.290 --> 41:40.155
Well, I think
I might have, uh,

41:40.190 --> 41:42.124
underestimated
the size of this job.

41:42.160 --> 41:44.025
(grunts)

41:44.060 --> 41:46.961
I'm thinking about telling Molly
I'm doubling my commission.

41:47.000 --> 41:48.934
How much are you
charging her now?

41:48.970 --> 41:51.131
Zero.

41:53.840 --> 41:56.900
How was work?

41:56.940 --> 41:58.100
Hmm?
How was work?

41:58.140 --> 41:59.277
Good.

41:59.310 --> 42:01.778
Yeah.

42:01.820 --> 42:04.175
(sighs)

42:09.290 --> 42:12.828
Everyone back safe?

42:14.230 --> 42:17.688
Yeah.

42:17.730 --> 42:19.095
Mikey.

42:19.130 --> 42:20.290
Hey, come here.

42:20.330 --> 42:21.319
Give me a hand, will you?
Sure, Dad.

42:21.370 --> 42:22.962
Hand me that tape,
will you?

42:23.000 --> 42:26.060
Okay. Fold that,

42:26.110 --> 42:28.305
the bottom one,
the sides.

42:28.340 --> 42:29.876
Let's close this
bad boy up, huh?

42:29.910 --> 42:32.276
Hold that tape
right there.

42:32.310 --> 42:34.619
One more, okay?

42:34.650 --> 42:36.049
Take two.

42:36.080 --> 42:38.014
Okay.

42:43.160 --> 42:44.650
(makes explosion sound)
