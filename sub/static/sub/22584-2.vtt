WEBVTT

00:02.000 --> 00:04.230
Previously, on Enterprise:

00:04.360 --> 00:07.397
We just pulled three.50 calibre bullets
from the shuttlepod hull.

00:07.520 --> 00:09.272
We are 200 years in the past.

00:10.080 --> 00:11.149
Insurgents!

00:14.360 --> 00:16.635
Your colleague has managed
to evade us.

00:16.760 --> 00:19.718
I assure you, whatever I want to know,
you'll tell me.

00:19.960 --> 00:21.109
Where are we?

00:21.320 --> 00:22.719
We in Brooklyn.

00:23.600 --> 00:25.158
The weapons I'm preparing...

00:25.280 --> 00:27.157
will make you immune
from any counterattack...

00:27.280 --> 00:28.679
anywhere in the world.

00:28.800 --> 00:32.031
The Germans were offering $10,000
for information leading to your capture.

00:32.159 --> 00:33.309
Why?

00:33.440 --> 00:36.113
All I can tell you is
we're on the same side.

00:36.840 --> 00:38.114
Holy mother of....

00:41.600 --> 00:42.749
We're trapped.

00:43.040 --> 00:46.396
The Germans are helping us construct
a conduit, so we can find our way home.

00:46.520 --> 00:50.274
I've sent you to this point because
it's here that Vosk can be stopped.

00:50.840 --> 00:53.354
If you succeed,
the timeline will be restored.

00:53.680 --> 00:56.353
One of his people told me
they were building a conduit.

00:56.480 --> 00:58.311
Find it. Destroy it.

00:58.760 --> 01:01.558
He must not succeed. Stop him.

01:02.640 --> 01:04.232
And now, the conclusion.

01:06.240 --> 01:07.229
"News on Parade."

01:07.360 --> 01:10.557
America and Germany together
in the fight for freedom!

01:10.880 --> 01:12.711
In his first visit
to the Home of the Brave...

01:12.840 --> 01:14.034
the German Chancellor...

01:14.160 --> 01:17.072
received a warm welcome
from the Big Apple!

01:20.120 --> 01:23.192
He greeted enthusiastic crowds
in Times Square.

01:23.320 --> 01:26.676
And took in the view from the top
of the Empire State Building.

01:27.080 --> 01:28.559
Watch that first step!

01:28.840 --> 01:31.832
Later, the Führer paid a call
to Lady Liberty...

01:31.960 --> 01:34.155
where he was given the keys to the city!

01:34.360 --> 01:38.512
The whirlwind tour was capped off
by a four-hour speech to city leaders...

01:38.640 --> 01:40.551
where the Führer outlined his vision...

01:40.680 --> 01:44.355
for a prosperous alliance
between Germany and America.

01:45.480 --> 01:47.596
Vowing to root out
the parasitic elements...

01:47.720 --> 01:50.518
that have crippled our economy
since 1929...

01:50.640 --> 01:54.428
and to liberate the masses
from the grip of financial profiteers.

01:55.120 --> 01:58.590
Together, we will put Americans
back to work!

01:58.760 --> 02:01.957
Two great nations,
marching side by side...

02:02.200 --> 02:04.316
toward a bold future!

02:09.080 --> 02:11.355
It's been a long road

02:13.360 --> 02:15.316
Gettin' from there to here

02:16.840 --> 02:18.592
It's been a long time

02:19.880 --> 02:23.031
But my time is finally near

02:23.840 --> 02:27.310
And I will see my dream
Come alive at last

02:28.000 --> 02:30.560
I will touch the sky

02:31.160 --> 02:34.755
And they're not gonna
Hold me down no more

02:34.960 --> 02:37.918
No, they're not gonna change my mind

02:38.040 --> 02:42.079
'Cause I've got faith of the heart

02:42.800 --> 02:45.360
I'm going where my heart will take me

02:45.480 --> 02:49.837
I've got faith to believe

02:49.960 --> 02:52.713
I can do anything

02:52.840 --> 02:56.833
I've got strength of the soul

02:57.440 --> 03:00.000
And no one's gonna bend or break me

03:00.160 --> 03:04.551
I can reach any star

03:05.760 --> 03:07.910
I've got faith

03:09.440 --> 03:11.715
I've got faith

03:13.120 --> 03:16.237
Faith of the heart

03:18.000 --> 03:24.074

03:28.560 --> 03:31.870
Our intelligence sources are convinced
that the American counterattack...

03:32.000 --> 03:33.752
will be launched within days.

03:34.520 --> 03:36.511
It's no longer a rumour, it's fact.

03:36.920 --> 03:39.275
I assume you're taking
the necessary steps.

03:40.720 --> 03:42.995
-What is that?
-An intelligence briefing.

03:43.360 --> 03:45.351
According to this,
your squadron performed...

03:45.480 --> 03:47.516
flawlessly in recent field tests.

03:47.640 --> 03:50.712
-You've been spying on us.
-We're protecting our interests.

03:50.960 --> 03:53.110
I suppose I would have done the same.

03:53.760 --> 03:55.876
Tell your Führer
he'll receive the squadron...

03:56.000 --> 03:58.036
when I deem it ready for deployment.

03:58.160 --> 03:59.673
This says it is ready for deployment.

03:59.800 --> 04:03.190
With all due respect,
your intelligence is flawed.

04:04.720 --> 04:06.597
We are tired of your stalling!

04:06.920 --> 04:09.673
And I am tired of your threats.

04:10.520 --> 04:13.398
You and your men have taken an oath
to defend Germany.

04:13.960 --> 04:17.111
-We take that oath seriously.
-Do you?

04:17.440 --> 04:20.273
You've made certain promises to me,
as well.

04:20.720 --> 04:23.075
We've provided everything
you've asked for.

04:24.400 --> 04:26.755
You'll not receive a single truckload...

04:26.960 --> 04:30.430
of additional supplies
till you fulfil your part of the agreement.

04:30.680 --> 04:34.036
General, you might consider
what would happen...

04:34.160 --> 04:37.232
if my weapons were to fall
into the hands of the Allies.

04:37.720 --> 04:39.233
Imagine Berlin...

04:40.800 --> 04:43.553
obliterated by plasma-cannons.

04:43.800 --> 04:47.509
-I should have you arrested for treason.
-You are a fool.

04:48.720 --> 04:50.119
You think we're equals...

04:50.240 --> 04:52.708
because I allow you to participate
in this struggle.

04:52.920 --> 04:55.275
You fight to control nations.

04:56.440 --> 04:59.238
We dominate entire worlds.

04:59.360 --> 05:02.875
We extend our will across time.

05:04.040 --> 05:07.077
If your race were to endure
for a million years...

05:08.040 --> 05:11.271
you couldn't begin to approach
what we've accomplished.

05:11.840 --> 05:15.913
The next time you feel the urge
to threaten me, remember this:

05:17.000 --> 05:18.877
I can erase you from history.

05:19.920 --> 05:21.512
As if you never existed.

05:49.920 --> 05:51.399
She was around my age.

05:53.160 --> 05:54.115
Twenty-six.

05:56.760 --> 05:58.034
Ensign O'Malley.

05:58.920 --> 06:00.114
How'd she die?

06:00.720 --> 06:02.836
In a battle with a hostile species.

06:04.600 --> 06:06.750
There's still war in the future?

06:07.480 --> 06:10.677
On Earth, between human beings,
war's been eliminated.

06:12.840 --> 06:15.195
But the galaxy's a big place,
with thousands of species.

06:15.320 --> 06:17.754
Not all of them
have the same values we have.

06:17.880 --> 06:19.029
Spaceships.

06:19.880 --> 06:22.519
People from other planets.

06:22.640 --> 06:25.837
People from the future.

06:27.040 --> 06:30.316
It's all a little too much
for Alicia Travers from Bensonhurst.

06:31.920 --> 06:33.797
Besides, I'm afraid of heights.

06:35.280 --> 06:37.396
I can send you anywhere in the world.

06:38.200 --> 06:40.668
To a place that isn't occupied
by the Germans.

06:41.200 --> 06:44.078
Seem to be fewer and fewer
of those places every day.

06:45.960 --> 06:47.234
I want to go home.

06:49.880 --> 06:51.233
To my neighbourhood.

06:51.520 --> 06:53.476
There are a lot of people
in trouble down there...

06:53.600 --> 06:56.353
and I'm not gonna
just turn my back on them.

06:58.680 --> 07:01.319
But you knew I was going to say that,
didn't you?

07:01.440 --> 07:02.714
I had a feeling.

07:05.880 --> 07:07.518
Two of my men are missing.

07:08.080 --> 07:10.514
They could be hiding out,
they might have been taken prisoner.

07:10.640 --> 07:11.789
They could be dead.

07:11.920 --> 07:14.070
We've got eyes on every street corner.

07:14.200 --> 07:16.031
I can put a word out.

07:19.720 --> 07:23.713
Archer, with this ship,
with all this power, you could help us.

07:23.840 --> 07:26.035
-You can help us stop those bastards.
-I know.

07:26.160 --> 07:28.196
Then do it. Start with Berlin.

07:28.320 --> 07:31.790
Wipe that damn place off the map,
and don't stop until you kill...

07:31.920 --> 07:33.433
every last one of them,
because what they--

07:33.560 --> 07:35.391
We're going to stop them.

07:35.520 --> 07:37.636
That's one of the reasons we're here.

07:37.880 --> 07:40.030
But we're going to do it another way.

07:41.120 --> 07:42.109
Okay.

07:43.760 --> 07:45.796
I guess you know what you're doing.

07:48.720 --> 07:52.030
You going to start by sending me down
with that dissolver thing?

07:53.920 --> 07:57.151
Shuttlepods are damaged.
The transporter's all we have.

07:57.680 --> 08:00.513
Archer, you promised me I wouldn't
have to go through that again.

08:00.640 --> 08:02.915
I'm going to have to break that promise.

08:03.680 --> 08:04.669
Okay.

08:04.960 --> 08:06.916
How does that thing work, anyway?

08:07.640 --> 08:09.949
On second thought, I'd rather not know.

08:10.520 --> 08:13.080
-Right away.
-Begin the test sequence.

08:14.240 --> 08:18.199
Based on the interrogations, I believe
the prisoners are not temporal agents.

08:18.920 --> 08:20.911
I've arrived at the same conclusion.

08:21.040 --> 08:24.589
Their technology suggests they're from
a period too early for time travel.

08:24.720 --> 08:27.757
They don't even seem to know
how they got to this century.

08:28.000 --> 08:28.989
It's curious.

08:29.120 --> 08:32.669
Still, I refuse to believe
their presence here is an accident.

08:42.919 --> 08:45.309
There's a surge
in one of the power modules.

08:45.720 --> 08:48.359
Run a complete system scan.
Isolate the fault.

08:52.200 --> 08:53.838
Our time is running out.

08:54.200 --> 08:57.954
-The Germans are becoming impatient.
-Why not give them what they want?

08:58.080 --> 09:00.196
I don't trust these people, I never have.

09:00.320 --> 09:02.117
I'm not about to furnish them
with weapons...

09:02.240 --> 09:04.037
that could be used against us.

09:05.040 --> 09:07.349
Return the prisoners
to their holding cell.

09:07.480 --> 09:09.516
See that they get medical attention.

09:13.440 --> 09:14.429
Go.

09:30.200 --> 09:32.873
Bring the doctor immediately.

09:48.320 --> 09:50.993
I think I've pinpointed
where the timeline changed.

09:51.320 --> 09:54.869
Someone assassinated Lenin in 1916.

09:55.200 --> 09:57.111
-Who took his place?
-No one.

09:57.600 --> 10:00.512
So without Lenin,
the Bolsheviks never gained power.

10:00.640 --> 10:02.471
Russia didn't become communist.

10:02.840 --> 10:03.520
And Germany never considered it
a threat.

10:03.520 --> 10:05.158
And Germany never considered it
a threat.

10:05.440 --> 10:07.829
Hitler was able to concentrate
on the West.

10:08.560 --> 10:11.393
After France,
Belgium and the Netherlands fell.

10:12.320 --> 10:15.995
Hitler quickly took England,
and then the eastern United States.

10:17.280 --> 10:19.874
But Vosk and his men
arrived on Earth recently.

10:20.680 --> 10:21.954
A few years ago.

10:22.080 --> 10:23.718
Then they
couldn't have been responsible...

10:23.840 --> 10:26.115
for the changes that took place in 1916.

10:26.240 --> 10:28.435
The police never captured
Lenin's assassin.

10:28.560 --> 10:32.030
Some bystanders claimed
that the killer vanished into thin air.

10:32.280 --> 10:35.033
Daniels said that different factions
in the Temporal War...

10:35.160 --> 10:36.309
are changing history...

10:36.440 --> 10:37.998
throughout the timeline.

10:38.640 --> 10:41.200
Maybe this assassin
was working for one of them.

10:41.680 --> 10:46.356
But I thought we were here to prevent
Vosk from starting the Temporal War.

10:47.040 --> 10:48.393
Chicken or the egg.

10:50.720 --> 10:52.631
Bridge to Captain Archer.

10:54.200 --> 10:57.590
-Go ahead.
-I'm receiving a transmission. It's Vosk.

11:05.520 --> 11:08.478
-This is Captain Archer.
-Your voice sounds familiar, Captain.

11:08.600 --> 11:10.318
-Have we met?
-What do you want?

11:10.440 --> 11:12.396
I believe I have two of your men.

11:13.080 --> 11:14.308
Are they all right?

11:14.440 --> 11:18.319
I think it would be mutually beneficial
to discuss this face-to-face.

11:18.440 --> 11:19.589
We can bring you aboard.

11:19.720 --> 11:22.359
I was thinking
of a more neutral location.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.389
There's a remote area outside the city.

11:25.720 --> 11:28.598
-That's not what I'd consider neutral.
-You have scanners.

11:29.320 --> 11:31.754
Examine the area before coming down.

11:32.120 --> 11:35.271
I'll have three men with me.
And your crewmen.

11:35.600 --> 11:40.230
-A few hours ago, you tried to kill me.
-The situation has changed.

11:40.720 --> 11:42.358
I'm sending you the coordinates.

11:42.480 --> 11:44.789
If you're interested,
meet me in one hour.

11:47.920 --> 11:48.830
Got 'em.

12:23.560 --> 12:25.630
It's good to see you again, Captain.

12:37.320 --> 12:38.548
Where are my men?

12:50.480 --> 12:51.595
Captain!

12:53.080 --> 12:56.072
-I don't believe it. How can--
-Are you all right?

12:58.160 --> 13:00.276
We weren't exactly treated like royalty.

13:00.400 --> 13:04.234
I apologise for the aggressiveness
of our questioning.

13:04.640 --> 13:05.629
Aggressive?

13:05.760 --> 13:08.354
We were operating
under a false impression.

13:10.120 --> 13:11.155
We're okay.

13:18.640 --> 13:20.676
-Get back to the ship.
-Wait a minute.

13:20.800 --> 13:22.552
-You're coming with us.
-Trip.

13:25.920 --> 13:26.760
Beam them up.

13:26.760 --> 13:27.078
Beam them up.

13:30.000 --> 13:34.039
You have your men, Captain.
Now, it's your turn to reciprocate.

13:34.760 --> 13:35.715
How?

13:35.840 --> 13:38.308
-I wish to discuss something with you.
-Go on.

13:39.040 --> 13:41.634
A species with your level
of technology...

13:41.760 --> 13:44.433
doesn't possess the capability
for time travel.

13:44.800 --> 13:46.995
-We had a little help.
-As I suspected.

13:48.640 --> 13:50.551
What do you know about me?

13:51.320 --> 13:53.231
I know that you're trapped here.

13:53.440 --> 13:55.670
And that you're trying to get back
to the 29th century.

13:55.800 --> 13:58.268
I also know you've made a deal
with the Germans.

13:58.400 --> 14:01.597
They're giving you supplies,
helping you build a time machine.

14:01.800 --> 14:04.473
I see I was both right and wrong
about you.

14:04.760 --> 14:06.478
You're not a temporal agent.

14:07.280 --> 14:09.430
But you're here to do their bidding.

14:09.640 --> 14:11.835
If you carry out your mission...

14:12.240 --> 14:14.515
if you make it back to the 29th century...

14:15.080 --> 14:17.389
you'll ignite a war
that will devastate the timeline.

14:17.520 --> 14:20.080
You've only heard
one side of the story, Captain.

14:20.200 --> 14:23.510
The temporal agents who sent you here
are a tyrannical sect...

14:23.640 --> 14:26.871
imposing their will on countless cultures
throughout history.

14:27.320 --> 14:29.629
They enforce the Temporal Accords.

14:29.920 --> 14:31.399
Preserve the timeline.

14:31.520 --> 14:34.990
They manipulate the timeline
to serve their own needs.

14:35.120 --> 14:38.590
If you've ever dealt with them,
then you know they do much more...

14:38.720 --> 14:40.790
than watch history unfold.

14:41.200 --> 14:44.875
They interfere with events.
They have an agenda.

14:46.160 --> 14:47.149
So do you.

14:47.280 --> 14:49.350
At least I don't hide my intentions.

14:49.840 --> 14:52.718
It's true, I don't agree
with the Temporal Accords.

14:53.000 --> 14:55.195
I believe
that time travel is a technology...

14:55.320 --> 14:57.276
no different than your warp drive...

14:57.400 --> 15:00.392
to be utilized for the benefit
of all species.

15:00.840 --> 15:05.391
Societies, cultures
can be improved through...

15:06.400 --> 15:09.836
careful manipulation
of historical events.

15:11.200 --> 15:13.475
Who decides
what improvements are needed?

15:13.840 --> 15:16.479
I won't be drawn
into a philosophical discussion.

15:17.120 --> 15:20.192
There's one simple reason
why you should help me, Captain.

15:20.640 --> 15:21.868
And what's that?

15:22.000 --> 15:24.150
I can send you back to your century.

15:25.600 --> 15:27.352
History's been changed.

15:28.720 --> 15:31.518
The century I left
will be completely different.

15:31.720 --> 15:33.950
Once I've defeated
the temporal agents...

15:34.200 --> 15:36.270
I'll reverse the damage
done to your timeline.

15:36.400 --> 15:38.834
Your history will return
to the way it was.

15:39.680 --> 15:43.150
I'm severely limited
by 20th-century Earth technology.

15:43.720 --> 15:45.711
The resources aboard your ship...

15:46.560 --> 15:48.915
will greatly accelerate my task.

15:49.600 --> 15:52.512
Go back. Reunite with your crewmen.

15:53.560 --> 15:55.357
And consider what I have said.

16:03.080 --> 16:06.470
-How are they doing?
-A few cuts and bruises.

16:06.600 --> 16:10.070
What happened after we beamed up?
You make some kind of deal?

16:10.600 --> 16:12.670
-He thinks we're considering it.
-Are we?

16:13.080 --> 16:14.195
Captain.

16:19.080 --> 16:20.672
What'd you see down there?

16:21.520 --> 16:24.353
We were in some huge building,
like a factory.

16:25.120 --> 16:28.510
They're constructing something big.
The Germans are helping them.

16:28.960 --> 16:30.279
I overheard them talking.

16:30.400 --> 16:33.153
They mentioned something
about a "temporal conduit."

16:33.520 --> 16:36.432
I know it sounds crazy,
but I think it's a time machine.

16:36.920 --> 16:40.037
Daniels sent us here
to stop them from completing it.

16:41.880 --> 16:43.074
Problem is...

16:47.040 --> 16:49.349
it's protected by some kind of...

16:51.600 --> 16:52.635
energy shield.

17:27.400 --> 17:30.437
-Who dressed this?
-Nicky Giorgio.

17:32.000 --> 17:33.956
What do you want? He's a mechanic.

17:34.440 --> 17:35.998
He should stick to cars.

17:37.760 --> 17:40.832
-At least it doesn't look infected.
-Could have been worse.

17:41.440 --> 17:44.557
-Could've ended up like Sal.
-It's a miracle you got away.

17:44.680 --> 17:46.193
Guess you should know.

17:47.080 --> 17:48.479
What's that supposed to mean?

17:49.360 --> 17:50.554
I know.

17:51.160 --> 17:52.434
I heard a rumour.

17:52.640 --> 17:54.198
When the soldiers cornered you
and Archer...

17:54.320 --> 17:55.878
you two disappeared into thin air.

17:56.000 --> 17:57.069
Like ghosts.

17:58.600 --> 18:00.636
-That's crazy.
-That's what I said.

18:00.880 --> 18:03.235
But then again,
I didn't believe in Nazi Martians...

18:03.360 --> 18:05.590
you know, not until I saw one myself.

18:07.560 --> 18:09.312
Want to tell me what this is?

18:09.720 --> 18:11.233
You went through my jacket?

18:11.360 --> 18:14.033
I was looking for a cigarette. What is it?

18:14.160 --> 18:16.993
-It's a radio.
-I never seen a radio like this.

18:17.120 --> 18:20.396
It looks like that thing Archer took off
that Martian guy, or whatever he was.

18:20.520 --> 18:22.556
Archer gave this to me
so that I could talk to him.

18:22.680 --> 18:24.557
Talk to him? Where is he?

18:26.640 --> 18:28.995
Alicia, you been like a little sister to us.

18:29.120 --> 18:31.111
You gonna start keeping secrets now?

18:44.280 --> 18:45.679
Where's my Engineer?

18:50.800 --> 18:51.789
Silik.

18:53.160 --> 18:54.878
This disc you were carrying...

18:55.560 --> 18:58.199
it contains schematics of Vosk's facility.

18:59.800 --> 19:01.950
This is what you came here for, isn't it?

19:02.080 --> 19:05.629
You persist in asking questions
you know I will not answer.

19:09.320 --> 19:11.436
I'll try answering them myself then.

19:13.320 --> 19:15.276
Your benefactor wants to do more...

19:15.400 --> 19:18.836
than just project his image into the past.

19:21.120 --> 19:24.908
He wants the technology
to travel into the past.

19:25.760 --> 19:29.036
Somehow, he found out that Daniels
was sending Enterprise here.

19:29.400 --> 19:31.470
So you were ordered to hitch a ride.

19:32.360 --> 19:36.035
Your mission was to break
into Vosk's compound and steal this.

19:38.880 --> 19:42.509
Tell me, how was I planning
to send that to the future?

19:43.520 --> 19:45.078
Maybe that's why
you came back aboard.

19:45.200 --> 19:47.270
Maybe you need Enterprise.

19:48.000 --> 19:51.436
-An impressive display, Captain.
-I'm glad you're not disappointed.

19:51.560 --> 19:54.916
Though I'm not implying you're correct
in any of your assumptions.

19:55.240 --> 19:56.229
Of course not.

19:56.360 --> 19:58.874
But you don't have the answer
you're seeking.

19:59.240 --> 20:01.515
The whereabouts
of your missing crewman.

20:02.200 --> 20:03.600
I think you left him somewhere
inside Vosk's compound.

20:03.600 --> 20:05.397
I think you left him somewhere
inside Vosk's compound.

20:05.520 --> 20:08.080
And for your sake, he'd better be alive.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.036
You've changed, Captain.

20:13.320 --> 20:15.151
And not at all for the better.

20:43.840 --> 20:47.628
A large amount of data has been stolen
from our computer system, Captain.

20:48.080 --> 20:50.230
We found trace amounts of bioresidue.

20:50.480 --> 20:53.836
-The thief is from your time period.
-He's Suliban.

20:54.760 --> 20:57.274
He's aboard my ship. He's a stowaway.

20:57.400 --> 21:01.439
We've encountered his faction before.
I want to speak with him.

21:01.800 --> 21:02.755
I can't allow that.

21:02.880 --> 21:07.112
And I suppose you aren't examining
the technology he stole from us?

21:07.440 --> 21:08.634
I reserve that right.

21:09.120 --> 21:12.032
And I reserve the right to destroy you.

21:12.560 --> 21:15.597
I have a plasma-cannon
aimed at your ship, Captain.

21:15.720 --> 21:18.280
And I have phase-cannons
aimed at your facility.

21:19.160 --> 21:21.549
I want an answer to my proposal.

21:22.560 --> 21:23.913
The answer is no.

21:35.080 --> 21:36.354
Return fire.

21:39.200 --> 21:41.111
Their shields are still holding.

21:43.800 --> 21:44.755
Travis.

21:45.840 --> 21:47.558
They're moving out of range.

21:48.880 --> 21:50.757
We needed them.

21:50.880 --> 21:53.997
We'll complete our objective
with the resources at hand.

21:54.280 --> 21:56.157
Resume your work.

21:59.840 --> 22:02.149
Engines took a serious hit.
Weapons are down.

22:02.320 --> 22:03.912
Get to work on repairs.

22:04.400 --> 22:06.118
Keep looking over those schematics.

22:06.240 --> 22:08.879
Find a way to disable the shields
protecting that compound.

22:15.840 --> 22:17.558
I'm getting my crewman back.

22:17.800 --> 22:19.870
You're going to help me
get inside the facility.

22:20.000 --> 22:22.514
And then? Are you going to destroy it?

22:23.000 --> 22:24.035
Yes.

22:24.480 --> 22:26.789
I don't care about your crewman,
Captain.

22:27.200 --> 22:30.397
But I don't want Vosk to succeed
any more than you do.

22:32.160 --> 22:33.309
I'll help you.

22:34.960 --> 22:36.359
There's one problem.

22:36.800 --> 22:39.633
I used my genetic enhancements
to get inside the building.

22:39.760 --> 22:43.548
Your presence will negate
that advantage.

22:43.720 --> 22:45.438
We'll work around it.

22:47.480 --> 22:50.756
You should be able to deactivate
the shields from this console.

22:51.400 --> 22:52.799
Here's the procedure.

22:52.920 --> 22:55.275
The data from the disc
was extremely helpful.

22:55.400 --> 22:56.628
You're welcome.

22:58.680 --> 23:01.148
When the shields are down,
give us 10 minutes...

23:01.320 --> 23:02.548
then destroy the facility.

23:02.680 --> 23:03.908
Our targeting array is off-line.

23:04.040 --> 23:05.951
We're in need
of Commander Tucker's skills.

23:06.080 --> 23:07.229
Do what you can.

23:07.360 --> 23:10.033
Move in close and fire point-blank
if you have to.

23:10.160 --> 23:11.195
Understood.

23:13.960 --> 23:14.995
Good luck.

23:23.280 --> 23:26.272
Three American divisions
have crossed the Ohio River.

23:26.400 --> 23:29.437
Two more are advancing
from the south toward Washington.

23:29.680 --> 23:31.193
By direct order from the Führer...

23:31.320 --> 23:33.515
the squadron
is to be transferred immediately...

23:33.640 --> 23:35.517
to Luftwaffe regional command.

23:36.280 --> 23:38.953
I am to personally oversee
the deployment.

23:39.440 --> 23:41.192
Weapons of this complexity...

23:41.560 --> 23:44.393
require extensive training to operate.

23:44.520 --> 23:47.796
We'll discuss the particulars
once you've fulfilled your obligation.

23:47.920 --> 23:50.036
-Six hours.
-Why the delay?

23:50.480 --> 23:53.313
The planes must be readied
for transport.

23:54.280 --> 23:56.271
Six hours.

24:02.440 --> 24:06.194
We're leaving tonight.
Begin preparations.

24:06.600 --> 24:09.876
Each time we open a conduit,
it collapses within seconds.

24:10.040 --> 24:13.919
Human leaders often speak of destiny.

24:18.480 --> 24:21.233
The conduit will hold.

24:53.760 --> 24:55.512
How do I look? Better?

24:58.960 --> 25:00.678
From my dealings
with you and your crew...

25:00.800 --> 25:04.076
I'd come to believe that your race
was inherently unaggressive.

25:13.480 --> 25:15.232
We've come a long way in a short time.

25:15.360 --> 25:16.475
One thing is clear.

25:16.600 --> 25:18.318
When necessary,
humans are fully capable...

25:18.440 --> 25:19.555
of reverting to old methods.

25:19.680 --> 25:22.478
The way you handled the Xindi threat
was extremely effective.

25:22.600 --> 25:25.751
No doubt it's the reason why
Daniels chose you to stop Vosk.

25:33.080 --> 25:35.036
Speaking of Vosk, it seems to me...

25:35.160 --> 25:36.752
that you both have a common enemy:
Daniels.

25:36.880 --> 25:38.393
Why hadn't you decided
to work together?

25:38.520 --> 25:40.511
One doesn't join forces with Vosk.

25:40.880 --> 25:44.111
-He's found some partners here.
-They're only a means to an end.

25:44.240 --> 25:47.949
To him and his followers, other species
exist only to serve their needs.

25:48.560 --> 25:50.915
Sounds like you
and Vosk have some history.

25:51.080 --> 25:53.674
His faction
once tried to eradicate the Suliban.

25:54.240 --> 25:56.037
They travelled into our past...

25:56.160 --> 25:59.436
altered it to prevent our species
from attaining sentience.

26:00.320 --> 26:02.231
Then how is it that you're here?

26:02.560 --> 26:05.632
He was stopped by the temporal agents.

26:06.600 --> 26:09.751
Are you saying you owe Daniels' people
your lives?

26:10.280 --> 26:12.589
They still oppose us,
they're still our enemy.

26:12.720 --> 26:14.199
That will never change.

26:27.840 --> 26:29.273
What the hell you want?

26:29.400 --> 26:31.072
I'm looking for Alicia Travers.

26:31.200 --> 26:33.555
-Who's asking?
-My name's Archer.

26:35.000 --> 26:36.513
Still hunting Martians?

26:36.960 --> 26:38.837
You just missed Billie Holiday.

26:39.320 --> 26:41.276
What are we going after this time?

26:41.400 --> 26:43.516
The Loch Ness monster?

26:48.840 --> 26:52.913
I'm picking up a surge of radio chatter.
Orders coming in German and English.

26:53.160 --> 26:54.559
There's heavy bombing.

26:54.680 --> 26:57.672
Most of it in eastern Pennsylvania
and southern Virginia.

26:58.040 --> 27:01.077
-Could be an Allied attack.
-Could it pose a danger to the Captain?

27:01.200 --> 27:04.158
The closest fighting is 100 kilometres
south of New York City.

27:04.600 --> 27:06.716
-lncredible.
-What's our repair status?

27:06.840 --> 27:08.353
Engines are at 36%.

27:08.800 --> 27:11.712
-Manoeuvring thrusters are off-line.
-Weapons?

27:12.240 --> 27:13.958
The targeting array's fried.

27:14.160 --> 27:15.832
We'll be shooting in the dark.

27:15.960 --> 27:19.157
-What's so important about this facility?
-They're building weapons there.

27:19.280 --> 27:21.510
Extremely powerful weapons.

27:21.640 --> 27:24.632
What I hear, you have
some pretty powerful weapons yourself.

27:24.760 --> 27:26.751
I made her tell me everything.

27:26.880 --> 27:30.270
-Not that I believe all of it.
-Do we really need these people?

27:30.400 --> 27:31.992
What do you mean, "these people"?

27:32.120 --> 27:34.156
I don't see how
they can be of any use to us.

27:34.280 --> 27:35.838
I'll tell you how I could be of use to you.

27:35.960 --> 27:38.076
How about I start removing
your teeth with my knuckles?

27:38.200 --> 27:39.553
-All right.
-Are you threatening me?

27:39.680 --> 27:41.750
-Give the man a prize!
-Why would you do that?

27:41.880 --> 27:43.916
-I'm gonna kill this guy!
-Carmine.

27:44.440 --> 27:46.431
Archer, what do you want us to do?

27:47.320 --> 27:49.311
I haven't signed off on this yet.

27:51.600 --> 27:53.955
Sal went along with you,
and look what it got him.

27:54.080 --> 27:57.117
If I'm gonna lose any more people,
there better be a good reason.

27:57.240 --> 28:00.710
Look, you know what, Carmine?
I'm gonna make this real easy for you.

28:01.440 --> 28:02.873
I'm gonna help him.

28:03.000 --> 28:06.356
All you have to do is decide
whether or not you're gonna help me.

28:09.320 --> 28:11.390
Our greatest scientist once said:

28:11.920 --> 28:15.549
"Every moment we live,
we are moving through time."

28:16.040 --> 28:19.396
We've earned the right
to choose which direction.

28:19.840 --> 28:24.038
The mastery of time
has allowed us to perfect ourselves.

28:24.240 --> 28:27.312
To reach our full potential as a people.

28:28.000 --> 28:30.594
And to vanquish those who oppose us.

28:31.000 --> 28:34.549
There's just one last enemy
to deal with.

28:35.240 --> 28:36.355
Soon...

28:36.680 --> 28:40.275
history will belong to us.

28:40.800 --> 28:45.396
We will stretch out our hands
and mould it according to our will.

28:45.640 --> 28:48.712
Not even the gods of our ancestors...

28:48.840 --> 28:52.310
could have imagined such power.

28:53.880 --> 28:55.359
My brothers...

28:56.800 --> 28:58.950
we are going home.

29:21.400 --> 29:23.550
What a way to spend a Saturday night!

29:46.000 --> 29:47.797
It only opens from the inside.

30:07.360 --> 30:09.669
There's too many of them! Come on!

30:27.160 --> 30:28.878
It's nice to see you.

30:41.080 --> 30:44.390
Insurgents. We don't know how many.

30:46.000 --> 30:47.877
A fortuitous development.

30:49.400 --> 30:52.676
Let the Germans deal with them.
Continue with the preparations.

31:00.640 --> 31:03.154
We're in,
making our way to the console.

31:03.280 --> 31:04.713
Our targeting array is still down.

31:04.840 --> 31:07.195
We're going to have to drop out of orbit
to get close enough.

31:07.320 --> 31:08.355
Understood.

31:08.920 --> 31:11.309
-Have you located Commander Tucker?
-Not yet.

31:11.440 --> 31:13.431
It's second on my list, believe me.

31:26.760 --> 31:27.988
Take cover.

31:36.200 --> 31:38.873
They're activating the conduit.
Work fast, Captain.

31:46.160 --> 31:48.116
-He did it.
-Take us in.

31:48.240 --> 31:49.229
Aye.

32:19.320 --> 32:21.515
We're in
an extremely precarious position.

32:21.640 --> 32:22.868
I hadn't noticed.

32:23.120 --> 32:25.031
It might help if I had a weapon.

32:26.080 --> 32:27.877
Sorry, only one to go around.

32:32.480 --> 32:33.629
Silik!

32:58.320 --> 33:00.675
The Earth ship
has entered the atmosphere.

33:00.800 --> 33:02.199
Activate the plasma weapon.

33:02.320 --> 33:05.437
-We can't spare the power.
-Then deploy the squadron.

33:06.000 --> 33:07.718
-Destroy them.
-No!

33:07.960 --> 33:09.996
The squadron is going to the front.

33:10.960 --> 33:12.757
Execute my order.

33:13.080 --> 33:15.355
I am taking command of this facility.

33:16.440 --> 33:18.112
You are relieved.

33:23.920 --> 33:25.148
I'm sorry, General.

33:25.280 --> 33:27.669
But I'm afraid I have to end our alliance.

33:29.720 --> 33:31.119
Archer to Enterprise.

33:34.240 --> 33:35.878
They're in the atmosphere.

33:36.080 --> 33:39.231
Ionisation. The signal can't penetrate.

33:41.320 --> 33:43.595
-We'll get you out of here.
-I think not.

33:46.800 --> 33:49.872
You've proven a worthy opponent,
Captain.

33:50.240 --> 33:53.437
I would have preferred
to die fighting you.

33:54.680 --> 33:57.513
But I suppose I can settle for this.

34:07.960 --> 34:10.315
-Trip.
-Hold it right there.

34:10.719 --> 34:11.994
-It's me.
-Shut up.

34:12.120 --> 34:15.429
Drop the disguise, Silik,
or I'll blow your ugly head off.

34:15.800 --> 34:18.313
If you do, you'll probably regret it.

34:23.000 --> 34:25.833
-Captain?
-Good to see you, Commander.

34:26.400 --> 34:29.277
-You're alive?
-As long as you don't pull that trigger.

34:32.760 --> 34:35.114
I can't believe it.

34:35.239 --> 34:37.754
-The building's about to blow up.
-Got you.

34:38.040 --> 34:38.995
This way.

34:40.360 --> 34:43.112
-Distance.
-100 kilometres.

34:44.239 --> 34:46.435
Targeting scanners still can't get a lock.

34:46.560 --> 34:48.232
I'm going to have to do this
the old-fashioned way.

34:48.360 --> 34:50.112
Switching to visual scanners.

34:51.719 --> 34:52.994
Slow us down.

34:53.560 --> 34:55.197
200 kph.

34:55.760 --> 34:59.435
A group of aircraft are taking off
from a base north of Manhattan.

35:00.160 --> 35:01.832
They're headed towards us.

35:06.760 --> 35:08.557
Nicky, cover them!

35:12.920 --> 35:16.037
-You got to pull your people out.
-I'm having too much fun.

35:16.280 --> 35:18.840
In a few seconds
this entire area's going to be bombed.

35:18.960 --> 35:20.075
Planes?

35:21.720 --> 35:24.314
Start falling back!
We got to get the hell out of here!

35:32.200 --> 35:34.668
I guess we have to say goodbye
all over again.

35:35.480 --> 35:38.278
-It's harder the second time.
-Can't argue with that.

35:39.280 --> 35:42.113
I want my neighbourhood back,
the way it was.

35:42.880 --> 35:44.757
And my husband, I want him home.

35:45.080 --> 35:47.833
-Fix all that, okay?
-I'll try.

35:50.240 --> 35:51.434
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

35:53.360 --> 35:54.793
You're welcome.

36:03.840 --> 36:06.673
German dive bombers: Stukas.

36:06.920 --> 36:08.831
Nothing too much to worry about.

36:09.040 --> 36:12.999
However, they were fitted with sirens
to frighten the enemy during an attack.

36:13.600 --> 36:17.070
-They fire 7.9 millimetre rounds.
-Mr. Reed.

36:18.560 --> 36:20.710
We're too far away. I still can't see it.

36:34.720 --> 36:37.678
It appears that bullets and sirens
aren't all they have.

36:39.400 --> 36:40.913
Photonic torpedoes.

36:59.200 --> 37:00.599
It's holding!

37:01.080 --> 37:04.038
I'm reading a powerful energy surge
inside the facility.

37:04.200 --> 37:05.713
-Malcolm.
-One more kilometre.

37:26.240 --> 37:27.468
Destiny.

37:36.280 --> 37:38.714
-I can see it.
-Take it out.

37:46.160 --> 37:47.513
No!

37:55.720 --> 37:57.073
It's quite a sight.

37:57.880 --> 37:59.791
The timeline's resetting itself.

38:00.880 --> 38:03.519
You did it. Vosk is dead.

38:03.920 --> 38:05.433
He didn't make it back.

38:05.760 --> 38:09.116
All of the damage he caused,
it never happened.

38:09.240 --> 38:11.470
And you're here to give me
a pat on the back.

38:11.600 --> 38:13.556
-ln a way.
-Well, I don't want it.

38:13.840 --> 38:16.308
I want you to leave me
and my crew alone.

38:17.280 --> 38:20.192
We're done with you and your damned
Temporal Cold War.

38:20.560 --> 38:23.199
It's coming to an end
because of what you did.

38:24.080 --> 38:26.230
You have no idea
how many lives you've saved.

38:26.360 --> 38:27.998
I'll take your word for it.

38:31.120 --> 38:32.439
Just send us home.

38:37.680 --> 38:39.272
It's almost ready.

38:42.080 --> 38:43.433
Goodbye, Jonathan.

38:44.360 --> 38:45.395
Captain.

38:47.400 --> 38:48.913
It's been a privilege.

38:58.840 --> 39:00.319
Everyone all right?

39:07.040 --> 39:08.155
Captain!

39:11.880 --> 39:13.472
We're in the right place.

39:18.280 --> 39:20.635
Let's find out if we're in the right time.

39:21.080 --> 39:22.115
Hoshi?

39:27.920 --> 39:29.399
Multiple signals.

39:29.640 --> 39:32.473
Lunar One Colony, orbit platform,
San Francisco...

39:32.600 --> 39:34.079
they're all calling in.

39:39.480 --> 39:41.869
I'm picking up vessels approaching.

39:42.760 --> 39:45.593
-Dozens of them.
-Do they look friendly?

39:46.305 --> 39:52.457
