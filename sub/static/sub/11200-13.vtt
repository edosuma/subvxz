WEBVTT

00:03.036 --> 00:05.334
HARRIMAN OVER PA: Unscheduled
offworld activation.

00:18.051 --> 00:19.678
What the hell was that?

00:20.487 --> 00:21.954
I don't know, sir.

00:22.823 --> 00:24.848
We're receiving SG-1's lDC.

00:24.958 --> 00:27.950
They're back early. Open the iris.

00:43.110 --> 00:44.771
There was nothing on your end?

00:44.878 --> 00:47.676
Nothing out of the ordinary
to account for what we heard?

00:47.781 --> 00:49.612
No, sir. It was perfectly routine.

00:49.716 --> 00:51.206
We just dialed the gate
and stepped through.

00:51.318 --> 00:53.513
Gate diagnostics showed no irregularities.

00:53.620 --> 00:56.646
Still, I'd like you to double-check
the data once we're done here.

00:56.757 --> 00:57.917
Yes, sir.

00:58.024 --> 00:59.924
Tell me about the planet.

01:00.026 --> 01:03.792
Well, we can confirm that the locals were
visited by a Prior about two weeks ago.

01:03.897 --> 01:06.365
He performed the standard miracles.

01:06.466 --> 01:10.368
Healed the sick, cured the blind
and passed out the usual literature.

01:10.470 --> 01:11.767
The natives are easy pickings.

01:11.872 --> 01:14.739
They feel as though they were abandoned
by their god, Amaterasu, and...

01:14.841 --> 01:15.967
Ba'al.

01:16.810 --> 01:19.074
-Excuse me?
-You said Amaterasu.

01:19.713 --> 01:23.911
According to the background file,
P4-R was once under Ba'al's control.

01:24.684 --> 01:26.618
P4-R.

01:26.720 --> 01:31.453
Sir, we went to PX7-455.
I believe you have the wrong report.

01:33.093 --> 01:36.119
Anyway, the Tok'ra
have been monitoring the inroads

01:36.229 --> 01:38.720
that the Ori have been making
in the region for quite some time.

01:38.832 --> 01:42.029
According to Selmak, they are taking
advantage of the relationships between...

01:42.135 --> 01:44.069
Did you just say Selmak?

01:45.305 --> 01:46.465
Indeed.

01:46.907 --> 01:48.772
Teal'c, Selmak is dead.

01:52.412 --> 01:53.436
Sir.

01:54.214 --> 01:56.682
Selmak and Jacob are very much alive.

01:56.783 --> 01:58.546
HARRIMAN: Offworld activation.

02:06.626 --> 02:09.493
-Chief?
-It's SG-1 's lDC, sir.

02:09.596 --> 02:12.463
This is when they were originally
scheduled to come back.

02:12.566 --> 02:14.591
Defense teams stand by.

02:17.637 --> 02:19.127
Open the iris.

03:51.064 --> 03:55.433
Well, according to the tests I've run,
they're both SG-1, identical in every way.

03:55.535 --> 03:56.661
How's that possible?

03:56.770 --> 03:59.637
Well, we know Ba'al's able to produce
adult clones of himself.

03:59.739 --> 04:02.833
Presumably, he could do the same with
our people given samples of their DNA.

04:02.943 --> 04:05.912
That doesn't explain
how they knew SG-1's lDC.

04:06.579 --> 04:10.709
And if their intel was good enough to get
their hands on something that sensitive,

04:10.817 --> 04:12.375
then how come they didn't know
about Selmak?

04:12.485 --> 04:14.976
Yeah, it's like they got the hard stuff right
and the easy stuff wrong.

04:15.088 --> 04:16.885
Ba'al would have known better.

04:16.990 --> 04:19.424
You know, the first team
was making some wild claims

04:19.526 --> 04:21.653
about people and past events.

04:22.562 --> 04:25.531
And since the second team
came back from the right planet

04:25.632 --> 04:27.395
at the scheduled time,

04:27.667 --> 04:30.932
it's safe to assume
that they're the real SG-1.

04:31.037 --> 04:34.268
Okay, then, who's the other team,
and where'd they come from?

04:34.908 --> 04:36.000
Exactly.

04:37.010 --> 04:38.272
We checked their story out.

04:38.378 --> 04:41.472
We went to PX7-445, the planet
they claim to have gated in from.

04:41.581 --> 04:44.243
The locals there swore
they'd never laid eyes on us.

04:44.351 --> 04:47.616
So this other team is lying.

04:48.188 --> 04:49.655
CARTER: Well, not necessarily, sir.

04:49.756 --> 04:52.884
It's possible
that they did gate in from PX7,

04:52.993 --> 04:54.392
just not the PX7 that we know.

04:54.494 --> 04:58.931
The multiverse theory of quantum physics
posits the existence of parallel universes,

04:59.032 --> 05:01.728
an infinite number
of ever-growing alternate realities

05:01.835 --> 05:03.598
that exist concurrently with our own.

05:03.703 --> 05:06.228
The theory holds that anything
that can happen will happen,

05:06.339 --> 05:08.569
if not in this reality, then in another.

05:08.675 --> 05:12.167
So you're saying
that somewhere in an alternate universe,

05:12.312 --> 05:15.372
I got to second base
with Amy Vanderberg?

05:16.416 --> 05:18.407
Theoretically, yes.

05:19.886 --> 05:21.979
Boggles the mind, don't it?

05:22.789 --> 05:25.587
We're part of a metaverse
in which individual sub-universes

05:25.692 --> 05:27.523
are continually being generated.

05:27.627 --> 05:30.824
Our own experience
with the quantum mirror proved as much.

05:31.031 --> 05:34.489
Realities can exist
where we never defeated the Goa'uld

05:34.601 --> 05:36.398
or the stargate program went public.

05:36.503 --> 05:38.767
-And Selmak is still alive.
-Exactly.

05:39.839 --> 05:41.830
Now, while it may feel immediate,

05:41.941 --> 05:45.001
the journey between gates
is not instantaneous.

05:45.111 --> 05:48.239
It takes, on average,
0.3 seconds travel time.

05:48.348 --> 05:50.407
However, according to
the gate diagnostics,

05:50.517 --> 05:54.044
the travel time for the other SG-1 team
clocked in at 3.4 seconds,

05:54.654 --> 05:56.554
suggesting a significantly longer trip.

05:56.656 --> 05:59.523
Okay, say, for example,
we accept the possibility

05:59.626 --> 06:03.494
that this is an alternate SG-1
from a parallel universe,

06:04.564 --> 06:06.395
how did they get here?

06:11.671 --> 06:13.138
I got nothing.

06:14.240 --> 06:15.264
Yet.

06:20.814 --> 06:22.406
Sumatra Mandheling.

06:22.515 --> 06:24.346
One cream, two sugars.

06:27.720 --> 06:29.085
Lucky guess.

06:29.322 --> 06:31.722
I usually have the instant myself.

06:35.495 --> 06:38.259
So I'm guessing
this almost feels like home, doesn't it?

06:38.364 --> 06:39.956
Almost like home.

06:40.400 --> 06:42.027
But if it was home,

06:43.336 --> 06:47.568
I'd be sitting where you're sitting,
and you'd be sitting here telling me,

06:48.775 --> 06:52.438
"I'd love to help you,
but I have no idea what's going on."

06:53.646 --> 06:56.444
I'm thinking one of two possible scenarios.

06:56.983 --> 07:00.316
A: Carter's right and you're
from an alternate universe,

07:00.420 --> 07:04.049
in which case we'll do everything
we can to get you back home.

07:04.724 --> 07:07.284
Or B: You're not who you say you are,

07:08.895 --> 07:12.592
in which case we need to find out
what you're really after.

07:13.867 --> 07:16.335
Actually, there's a third scenario.

07:16.970 --> 07:20.804
C: You're not who you say you are,

07:21.541 --> 07:24.942
and it's up to us to find out
what you're after.

07:33.186 --> 07:35.450
I understand your reluctance to trust us,

07:35.555 --> 07:38.991
but rest assured we're just as eager
to get to the bottom of this as you are.

07:39.092 --> 07:42.892
No offense, but I'm not entirely sold
on the alternate world theory.

07:43.062 --> 07:46.828
There was nothing on our mission to PX7
that would even hint at it.

07:46.933 --> 07:49.128
No quantum mirror.
No weird alien artifacts.

07:49.235 --> 07:50.998
It was a routine op.

07:51.104 --> 07:54.369
But you're telling me that somehow

07:55.041 --> 07:57.009
the gate sent us through
to a parallel universe,

07:57.110 --> 07:59.044
even though we know
it's not supposed to work like that.

07:59.145 --> 08:03.081
-And yet here you are.
-Assuming, of course, this is the SGC.

08:04.150 --> 08:06.209
SG-1, six years ago,

08:06.586 --> 08:10.181
wake up in what they think is the SGC.
Turns out they're not really on Earth,

08:10.290 --> 08:13.350
and it's all part
of an elaborate Goa'uld plot.

08:14.994 --> 08:17.189
Pegasus Galaxy. Last year.

08:18.364 --> 08:22.266
A team from the Atlantis base gates
through to what they think is the SGC.

08:22.368 --> 08:24.962
Turns out they're not really on Earth.

08:25.672 --> 08:29.073
It's another planet,
and they're being manipulated by aliens.

08:29.175 --> 08:32.303
Let me put your mind at ease.
We are neither the Goa'uld

08:32.412 --> 08:34.403
nor manipulative aliens.

08:35.582 --> 08:38.813
You'll forgive me, sir,
if I don't take your word for it.

08:38.952 --> 08:41.750
We won our freedom
in the battle for Dakara,

08:41.854 --> 08:44.652
and on that day, not only did we defeat
Ba'al and the Replicators,

08:44.757 --> 08:48.249
you ensured that Anubis
would never again threaten this galaxy.

08:48.361 --> 08:52.127
And then all Jaffa were united
under our new leader, Bra'tac.

08:52.599 --> 08:53.793
Bra'tac?

08:54.667 --> 08:57.261
Really? That hasn't happened here yet.

08:58.304 --> 09:01.398
And with the new threat to this galaxy,
I returned to SG-1.

09:01.507 --> 09:04.271
Right, along with Colonel Mitchell, myself,
and eventually Colonel Carter,

09:04.377 --> 09:07.471
-who rejoined following her...
-Following her honeymoon.

09:08.381 --> 09:09.439
What?

09:10.750 --> 09:13.742
No, I was gonna say following her stint
on the Prometheus.

09:13.853 --> 09:16.344
-Honeymoon?
-lndeed.

09:25.698 --> 09:26.824
(SIGHS)

09:28.301 --> 09:31.896
We weren't able to stop the Ori
from establishing the second beachhead.

09:32.005 --> 09:35.668
By the time we realized, it was too late.
They'd already sent their ships through.

09:35.775 --> 09:37.640
If it happened in our reality...

09:37.744 --> 09:40.212
There's a good chance
it could happen in ours as well.

09:40.313 --> 09:43.339
They destroyed Chulak, Dakara,
most of the Jaffa strongholds.

09:43.449 --> 09:46.077
It's only a matter of time
before they attack Earth.

09:46.185 --> 09:48.847
-You have to find a way to get us back.
-I'm working on it.

09:48.955 --> 09:50.946
-I've been going over the gate diagnostics.
-And?

09:51.057 --> 09:54.686
There was an unidentifiable
energy spike just prior to your arrival.

09:54.794 --> 09:58.662
It's almost certainly related to the sound
they heard, but I'm still analyzing the data.

09:58.765 --> 10:02.257
We were on PX7 for over 24 hours
gathering intel.

10:02.769 --> 10:06.068
And yet, when your team went back
to the planet, no one recognized you.

10:06.172 --> 10:09.008
Now, that suggests that our point of
departure was definitely in our universe.

10:09.008 --> 10:10.305
Now, that suggests that our point of
departure was definitely in our universe.

10:10.510 --> 10:11.977
So whatever happened...

10:12.078 --> 10:15.138
Had to have happened between the time
you stepped through the gate on your end

10:15.248 --> 10:16.977
and the time you stepped through
the gate on this end.

10:17.083 --> 10:20.610
Except the gate system isn't designed
to transport matter between universes.

10:20.720 --> 10:24.451
It isn't designed to take you back
in time, either, but it has before.

10:24.557 --> 10:26.149
Did you notice any...

10:26.259 --> 10:30.127
No unusual weather patterns
or solar flare activity at the time.

10:30.229 --> 10:33.892
Then is it conceivable something else
could have affected the wormhole?

10:34.000 --> 10:38.130
What could possibly exert that kind
of influence on a subspace matter stream?

10:38.705 --> 10:40.798
-A black hole.
-A black hole.

10:43.643 --> 10:46.737
As we discussed the situation,
we realized we could pinpoint the source

10:46.846 --> 10:48.609
of the phenomenon to a precise window.

10:48.715 --> 10:51.741
Specifically, the interim journey
between the two gates.

10:51.851 --> 10:54.149
-Did she just say "we"?
-Pardon me?

10:54.253 --> 10:56.153
She said "we." You said "we"?

10:56.923 --> 10:59.756
Me and myself, I suppose.

10:59.859 --> 11:01.326
The other Samantha Carter.

11:01.427 --> 11:04.590
Right. Finally someone
who can keep up with you, huh?

11:04.697 --> 11:05.721
Yup.

11:06.265 --> 11:09.826
Okay. This is PX7-455,
their point of departure.

11:10.069 --> 11:12.833
And this is Earth, their point of arrival.

11:12.939 --> 11:15.874
The wormhole that brought them here
crossed this section of space,

11:15.975 --> 11:17.772
bisecting this singularity.

11:17.877 --> 11:20.778
The black hole that was created
when we destroyed the Ori beachhead.

11:20.880 --> 11:24.680
Exactly. Now, I'm theorizing
that as they bisected the singularity,

11:24.784 --> 11:28.720
subspace was ruptured,
creating a rift in the space-time continuum

11:28.821 --> 11:31.255
that brought that SG-1 into this universe.

11:31.357 --> 11:33.086
But we've had teams gate in
from locations

11:33.192 --> 11:35.786
on the other side of that black hole
in our universe.

11:35.895 --> 11:38.887
-Why weren't they affected?
-One more stupid question.

11:39.832 --> 11:42.528
Sir, yours was fine. Mine is stupid.

11:43.536 --> 11:46.164
Why didn't we end up on alternate PX7
when we gated through

11:46.272 --> 11:49.605
-to check on Bizarro SG-1 's story?
-I can't answer that.

11:49.709 --> 11:51.802
As far as I know,
the deviation was one-way

11:51.911 --> 11:54.209
and specific to that particular wormhole.

11:54.313 --> 11:57.339
However, just to be on the safe side,
I would suggest that we reroute

11:57.450 --> 12:00.351
all gate travel around the singularity
for the time being.

12:00.453 --> 12:02.819
HARRIMAN: Unscheduled
offworld activation.

12:08.361 --> 12:09.692
What do you have for me now, Walter?

12:09.796 --> 12:12.856
Sir, it's SG-1's lDC again.

12:13.666 --> 12:14.997
Do you want me to send a confirmation?

12:15.101 --> 12:18.161
If another team comes through,
they'd just be stranded like the first one.

12:18.271 --> 12:19.795
Receiving radio transmission.

12:19.906 --> 12:20.873
Let's hear it.

12:20.973 --> 12:22.668
MITCHELL: Stargate Command,
this is Mitchell.

12:22.775 --> 12:25.335
What's the holdup?
We got a situation here.

12:25.445 --> 12:29.472
-Sir, if we don't open the iris...
-Stargate Command. Do you read?

12:29.582 --> 12:31.072
Defense teams.

12:34.720 --> 12:36.415
Open the iris.

12:52.939 --> 12:54.702
What the hell is going on?

13:08.554 --> 13:12.046
So much for this phenomenon
being restricted to one wormhole.

13:12.158 --> 13:14.649
I may have underestimated its influence.

13:14.760 --> 13:18.025
It's possible the first spatial tear
may have caused a ripple effect

13:18.130 --> 13:20.963
across several realities,
transforming an area of their subspace

13:21.067 --> 13:25.436
into a kind of funnel that's redirecting
their gate travel to this universe.

13:25.538 --> 13:28.098
Any wormhole passing close enough
to the black hole

13:28.207 --> 13:31.301
is being drawn into the singularity
and rerouted here.

13:31.444 --> 13:34.811
-So you're telling me that we're the hub?
-A convergence point. Yes, sir.

13:34.914 --> 13:38.077
It might account for why gate travel
in this universe wasn't affected.

13:38.184 --> 13:40.516
-Might account? Colonel Mitchell.
-Sir.

13:40.620 --> 13:43.555
Inform all offworld teams
to proceed to the Alpha Site.

13:43.656 --> 13:46.887
Until further notice, gate travel
to and from Stargate Command

13:46.993 --> 13:48.824
will be suspended indefinitely.

13:48.928 --> 13:50.486
What if there're
more teams coming in hot, sir?

13:50.596 --> 13:52.325
I'm willing to make
the occasional exception,

13:52.431 --> 13:54.922
but I'm not about to turn this base

13:55.034 --> 13:57.730
into the Grand Central Station
of the multiverse.

13:57.837 --> 13:59.134
Dismissed.

14:04.644 --> 14:07.579
Why is it that every team
that's come through the gate so far

14:07.680 --> 14:10.148
has been exclusively an alternate SG-1?

14:10.249 --> 14:13.548
I mean, how come
no alternate SG-2s or SG-3s?

14:13.653 --> 14:15.518
Well, SG-1 is the frontline team,

14:15.621 --> 14:17.987
the one most likely
to get into trouble offworld,

14:18.090 --> 14:21.025
and, as a result, the team
we'd be most likely to have to let through.

14:21.127 --> 14:23.288
-Right.
-So far, we've turned back over 50 teams,

14:23.396 --> 14:25.887
and not all of them have been SG-1.

14:25.998 --> 14:29.229
Here's the really interesting part.
Each team from each reality

14:29.335 --> 14:32.566
has dialed in from
a different point of origin. No repeats.

14:33.072 --> 14:36.132
All originating from a corridor of space
starting from Earth

14:36.242 --> 14:38.676
and passing within a few degrees
of the singularity.

14:38.778 --> 14:41.804
What about
that superfluous energy signature?

14:42.148 --> 14:43.206
Has that happened again?

14:43.316 --> 14:45.944
No. Not since the first alternate team
dialed in.

14:46.052 --> 14:48.543
-Any idea what it was?
-I'm not sure,

14:49.188 --> 14:52.123
-but it reminds me of the incident on...
-CARTER 2: K'Tau.

14:52.458 --> 14:56.292
In that case, we introduced
an unstable, superheavy element

14:56.395 --> 14:58.386
into their sun's nuclear reaction.

14:58.497 --> 15:01.227
When the wormhole that brought us there
passed directly through it.

15:01.334 --> 15:04.269
But in this case, the wormhole is passing
through a black hole.

15:04.370 --> 15:06.964
So who knows what the effect would be?

15:07.873 --> 15:10.068
I thought we could use the help.

15:10.176 --> 15:11.837
(LAUGHING)

15:11.944 --> 15:14.811
Yeah. I suppose two heads
are better than one.

15:15.581 --> 15:17.947
HARRIMAN: Unscheduled
offworld activation.

15:18.050 --> 15:19.381
(ALARM BLARING)

15:19.485 --> 15:21.248
Let's get to work.

15:28.894 --> 15:30.088
General.

15:30.329 --> 15:32.957
Oh, I was just about to come find you.

15:34.367 --> 15:36.733
TEAL'C: I've contacted Bra'tac on Dakara.

15:36.869 --> 15:39.736
He has dispatched the mother ship
to the location provided us

15:39.839 --> 15:41.534
by the other Colonel Carter.

15:41.641 --> 15:43.734
JACKSON: If the Ori attempt to establish
a second beachhead there,

15:43.843 --> 15:45.708
the Jaffa should give us a heads-up.

15:45.811 --> 15:49.076
Presuming, of course, that events play out
the same way at both universes.

15:49.181 --> 15:51.308
To this point,
the particulars of the variant universes

15:51.417 --> 15:53.408
have remained remarkably similar.

15:53.519 --> 15:55.953
That's what I wanted to talk to you about.

15:56.088 --> 15:58.522
Another SG-1 came through
20 minutes ago,

15:58.624 --> 16:01.957
which puts the count at 12 teams,
not including yourselves.

16:02.061 --> 16:03.653
Well, at least we're in good company.

16:03.763 --> 16:06.323
This last team is a little different
in terms of personnel.

16:06.432 --> 16:07.592
How so?

16:07.867 --> 16:11.132
Well, there's someone I thought
you might like to talk to.

16:20.479 --> 16:23.380
Daniel? Teal'c, where's General O'Neill?

16:25.217 --> 16:28.015
I'm sure you all have a lot to catch up on.

16:34.360 --> 16:35.486
Janet.

16:37.730 --> 16:39.095
Dr. Frasier.

16:40.633 --> 16:42.396
What's going on here?

16:43.102 --> 16:46.367
Janet, this may look like home to you,
but it's not.

16:46.706 --> 16:48.503
This is not the Stargate Command
you left.

16:48.607 --> 16:50.199
We're not the Daniel and Teal'c you know.

16:50.309 --> 16:53.278
You and your team
gated to a parallel reality.

16:53.379 --> 16:57.281
This is an alternate SGC on
an alternate Earth in an alternate universe.

16:57.783 --> 17:01.721
In our reality,
Dr. Janet Frasier died two years ago.

17:01.721 --> 17:01.812
In our reality,
Dr. Janet Frasier died two years ago.

17:04.423 --> 17:09.326
Sixteen different SG-1s.
Sixteen different points of origin.

17:09.562 --> 17:13.555
But only one point of convergence.
This universe. Now, given the fact

17:13.666 --> 17:15.327
that previous trips through this black hole

17:15.434 --> 17:17.095
didn't produce a rupture
in the subspace structure...

17:17.203 --> 17:20.604
They may not have produced the rupture,
but it is entirely possible

17:20.706 --> 17:24.972
that their repeated trips contributed to
the deterioration of the space-time fabric

17:25.077 --> 17:27.841
that weakened,
eventually ceded to the singularity,

17:27.947 --> 17:29.744
creating the bridge
between the various realities.

17:29.849 --> 17:33.376
And I'm thinking that the proximity
of these realities in relation to each other

17:33.486 --> 17:36.887
may account for the absence
of the entropic cascade failure,

17:36.989 --> 17:39.457
but it still doesn't help us
with the main problem.

17:39.558 --> 17:41.719
How do we reverse the process?

17:41.827 --> 17:43.419
I don't have the answer to that,

17:43.529 --> 17:47.761
because if I did, we all wouldn't be here.

17:48.501 --> 17:50.366
-Coffee?
-No, thank you.

17:51.637 --> 17:54.970
You know, I can't help but think that
this whole thing would be a lot easier

17:55.074 --> 17:57.975
if Hammond hadn't ordered us
to destroy the quantum mirror.

17:58.077 --> 18:02.411
We could just use that to send all
these teams back to their proper realities.

18:02.515 --> 18:03.539
How?

18:04.049 --> 18:07.507
I mean, there are a near-infinite
number of parallel universes.

18:07.620 --> 18:09.850
The chances of us finding
the right home universe

18:09.955 --> 18:12.685
for even one of these teams
is next to impossible.

18:12.792 --> 18:14.783
Excuse me, Colonel Carter.

18:17.163 --> 18:19.028
My Colonel Carter.

18:20.733 --> 18:22.030
Here, sir.

18:22.802 --> 18:26.135
I've brought another volunteer
who's offered to help.

18:36.115 --> 18:37.377
Martouf.

18:39.952 --> 18:41.510
Hello, Samantha.

18:47.960 --> 18:50.224
I remember the mission to P3X.

18:50.462 --> 18:53.454
I was tending to a wounded airman.
We came under fire.

18:53.566 --> 18:56.228
You were there. You helped me
stabilize him and got us out of there.

18:56.335 --> 18:57.768
No, I didn't.

18:58.370 --> 19:02.033
You were hit by an errant staff blast
and killed instantly.

19:03.442 --> 19:06.172
You were honored with a hero's funeral.

19:06.412 --> 19:07.640
Lucky me.

19:11.383 --> 19:14.250
Hopefully you'll be able to return
to your world soon.

19:14.353 --> 19:15.320
-Hopefully?
-Yeah.

19:15.421 --> 19:18.185
For the moment, it looks like
your trip here was only one way.

19:18.290 --> 19:19.348
No.

19:19.458 --> 19:22.222
No, you have to find a way to get us
back as soon as possible.

19:22.328 --> 19:23.989
Yeah, Sam and Dr. Lee are
working on something.

19:24.096 --> 19:27.759
No, you don't understand.
We have been targeted by the Ori.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.729
Earth is being ravaged by a plague.

19:29.835 --> 19:32.531
Hundreds of thousands
have been infected.

19:33.205 --> 19:37.005
If we don't find a cure,
the entire planet will be wiped out.

19:43.048 --> 19:44.140
So,

19:45.451 --> 19:49.512
-how are things in your universe?
-You mean between us?

19:50.890 --> 19:52.653
I'm a little curious.

19:53.792 --> 19:55.225
Things developed,

19:55.327 --> 19:58.592
but with you being
on the other side of the galaxy, well,

19:58.697 --> 20:01.928
Iong-distance relationships
can be difficult.

20:02.735 --> 20:05.704
I eventually joined
the stargate program to be closer to you.

20:05.804 --> 20:09.501
We worked together, even lived together
for quite some time.

20:10.009 --> 20:12.671
But in the end, things didn't work out.

20:13.012 --> 20:15.173
You're with someone else now.

20:15.781 --> 20:18.045
-Who?
-I think I have something.

20:22.788 --> 20:26.315
This is the post-mortem analysis
of the P3W-451 incident.

20:26.725 --> 20:30.161
A planet whose orbit
strayed too close to a black hole.

20:30.462 --> 20:33.022
One of our teams was attempting
to gate back at the same time,

20:33.132 --> 20:37.125
and as a result, the SGC couldn't
shut down the gate from this end.

20:38.704 --> 20:41.195
-I don't see what this is...
-We were unable to sever the connection,

20:41.307 --> 20:43.036
because Stargate Command
was still connected

20:43.142 --> 20:46.805
to the singularity's gravitational field
through the open stargate.

20:46.912 --> 20:48.436
But we're not trying to...

20:48.547 --> 20:51.539
In that case, we used a shaped charge
to deliver an energy surge

20:51.650 --> 20:52.617
to the matter stream,

20:52.718 --> 20:54.879
forcing the matter stream
to jump to a different gate,

20:54.987 --> 20:56.579
thereby severing the connection.

20:56.689 --> 20:58.486
That could explain the sound they heard

20:58.590 --> 21:01.491
and the superfluous energy signature
that accompanied the matter stream

21:01.593 --> 21:04.289
from the first wormhole.
It was some sort of...

21:04.396 --> 21:08.628
Maybe a supernova or a gamma-ray burst
discharging at the exact millisecond

21:08.734 --> 21:11.328
that wormhole passed through
that singularity.

21:11.637 --> 21:13.798
It's a one-in-a-billion fluke

21:14.239 --> 21:16.639
that ruptured subspace
and created the point of confluence

21:16.742 --> 21:19.438
that drew the affected realities
into this one.

21:19.812 --> 21:21.609
Then, to seal the bridge
between the multiverse,

21:21.714 --> 21:23.682
we have to target that point of confluence.

21:23.782 --> 21:27.047
Basically recreate the circumstances
that caused the breach in the first place.

21:27.152 --> 21:28.710
But how is that possible?

21:28.821 --> 21:31.381
You said it yourself.
It was a one-in-a-billion freak incident.

21:31.490 --> 21:33.617
Well, the odds would increase significantly

21:33.726 --> 21:36.217
if we took the wormhole
out of the equation.

21:37.997 --> 21:39.897
Then what happens to us?

21:39.999 --> 21:41.830
We'd be stranded here.

21:44.903 --> 21:46.530
I considered not telling you about this.

21:46.638 --> 21:49.198
I understand why you hesitated,
but you made the right decision.

21:49.308 --> 21:52.607
By sealing the rupture, we'll ensure
that no other teams get stranded here.

21:52.711 --> 21:55.111
That's provided that this actually works.

21:55.214 --> 21:57.614
Well, we still have one major obstacle
to overcome.

21:57.716 --> 22:01.379
How do we deliver an explosive device
into the singularity?

22:04.223 --> 22:06.020
We get help from a friend.

22:06.125 --> 22:09.288
Thor sends his apologies
for not attending personally,

22:09.395 --> 22:12.228
but he and Heimdall
are in a neighboring galaxy

22:12.331 --> 22:14.822
dealing with a most sensitive matter.

22:14.933 --> 22:18.960
In his stead, I have conveyed
the time-dilation device as requested.

22:19.071 --> 22:21.801
We appreciate
your quick response, Kvasir.

22:21.907 --> 22:24.102
So what do you think? Will this work?

22:24.209 --> 22:26.404
I prefer not to prognosticate.

22:27.012 --> 22:30.675
Well, don't prognosticate.
Just tell us what your gut feeling is.

22:30.783 --> 22:34.446
Speculating on the matter
would serve no practical purpose.

22:34.987 --> 22:37.649
Joseph and Mary. What are the odds?

22:38.090 --> 22:39.455
Less than 12%,

22:39.558 --> 22:41.958
and that is provided
you are able to enact the plan

22:42.061 --> 22:45.656
before the black hole's gravity
decimates your ship.

22:45.998 --> 22:47.192
Damn, that's cold.

22:47.299 --> 22:50.291
Colonel Mitchell, Colonel Carter,
I'm giving you the green light.

22:50.402 --> 22:52.427
Shut this thing down.

22:53.772 --> 22:57.936
You know, I read
all the mission reports on the Asgard.

22:59.311 --> 23:01.302
They're not what I expected.

23:01.413 --> 23:03.347
What were you expecting?

23:03.949 --> 23:06.941
Well, pants for one.

23:12.758 --> 23:15.886
KVASlR: The distance between
the launch point and the target is crucial.

23:15.994 --> 23:18.258
And you must be precise
in your calculations.

23:18.363 --> 23:19.523
I know.

23:19.865 --> 23:23.028
The slightest oversight
in either the timing of the explosion

23:23.135 --> 23:25.831
or the proximity of your ship
to the singularity

23:25.938 --> 23:30.136
could result in a failed mission at best,
certain death at worst.

23:32.377 --> 23:35.141
I'm sorry.
I'm having a hard time concentrating.

23:35.247 --> 23:37.408
I understand. You are tired.

23:38.183 --> 23:41.084
Allow me to complete
the calibration for you.

23:42.287 --> 23:43.982
Knock yourself out.

23:48.193 --> 23:49.455
(SIGHS)

23:49.828 --> 23:52.388
Time and again, we've managed
to save Earth and its allies

23:52.498 --> 23:54.557
from the most dire threats.

23:56.768 --> 24:00.033
Situations in which we faced
insurmountable odds,

24:00.873 --> 24:03.068
almost certain defeat,
but we always managed to find a way

24:03.175 --> 24:05.336
-to prevail in the end.
-I'm sorry.

24:07.045 --> 24:09.036
I wish there was a way
I could send you home,

24:09.148 --> 24:11.048
or in the very least delay the mission so...

24:11.150 --> 24:14.085
You have no choice
but to do what's best for your world.

24:14.186 --> 24:16.950
I assume yours is not the only SG team
in your reality

24:17.055 --> 24:18.857
that's actively searching
for a cure to the plague.

24:18.857 --> 24:19.983
that's actively searching
for a cure to the plague.

24:20.125 --> 24:21.114
No.

24:21.393 --> 24:24.226
And I have a feeling
that your Samantha Carter is back home

24:24.329 --> 24:25.819
working on the problem.

24:25.931 --> 24:28.900
She stopped being
my Samantha a long time ago.

24:30.669 --> 24:32.432
I've missed you.

24:38.443 --> 24:40.673
(FOOTSTEPS PATTERING)

24:48.153 --> 24:50.553
I have completed the calibrations.

24:52.457 --> 24:54.084
Thank you, Kvasir.

25:07.439 --> 25:10.897
General, sorry to disturb you.
I was wondering if I could have a word.

25:11.009 --> 25:13.068
Of course, Doctor. Come in.

25:15.714 --> 25:16.772
Thank you.

25:19.284 --> 25:22.344
Sir, I would like to make a request
on behalf of all of the teams

25:22.454 --> 25:24.149
stranded in this reality.

25:24.256 --> 25:27.851
Please postpone this mission
until we can find a way to get home.

25:27.993 --> 25:29.221
I can't do that.

25:29.328 --> 25:32.923
We need our teams out there
gathering intel on the Ori threat

25:33.031 --> 25:34.965
instead of sitting on their hands here

25:35.067 --> 25:37.592
waiting for normal gate operations
to resume.

25:38.270 --> 25:40.761
And that won't be possible
until this problem is dealt with.

25:40.872 --> 25:43.306
While I can empathize, sir, believe me,

25:43.408 --> 25:46.138
I think you need to take a look
at the bigger picture.

25:46.245 --> 25:50.648
This goes beyond this world,
beyond this galaxy, this universe.

25:51.316 --> 25:54.114
Hundreds of billions of lives are at stake.

25:54.653 --> 25:57.087
Their survival could hinge
on not just our return

25:57.189 --> 26:00.352
but the return of every SG-1
stranded on this base.

26:00.459 --> 26:04.156
Sir, back in my universe,
Earth is facing a global pandemic.

26:04.263 --> 26:07.391
One that your planet
has already faced and beaten.

26:07.499 --> 26:09.399
You have the cure
that could save my world.

26:09.501 --> 26:11.526
All I have to do is get it to them.

26:11.637 --> 26:15.437
I can also empathize,
but at the risk of sounding callous,

26:16.141 --> 26:18.541
my priorities are with this world.

26:19.311 --> 26:23.441
How can you prioritize the lives
of one group over those of another?

26:23.815 --> 26:26.375
What makes my Earth any less important
than your own?

26:26.485 --> 26:29.716
We have the top minds
from 18 different universes

26:29.821 --> 26:30.822
working on a way to get you home.

26:30.822 --> 26:31.686
working on a way to get you home.

26:31.790 --> 26:33.257
Now hopefully they can come up
with a solution

26:33.358 --> 26:36.589
before this mission is completed,
but if they can't,

26:37.562 --> 26:39.154
then I'm sorry, Doctor.

26:50.208 --> 26:53.644
We finished loading the warhead
in the time-dilation generator.

26:53.779 --> 26:57.271
Once the system's checks are complete,
we're good to go.

26:59.985 --> 27:03.011
-Where's the crew?
-You're looking at it.

27:03.155 --> 27:06.682
Given the dangers we may face, it was
decided that we would proceed alone.

27:06.792 --> 27:09.989
So if this plan goes fubar, we're the only
ones to go down with the ship?

27:10.095 --> 27:10.329
Well, there's plenty more
where we came from, right?

27:10.329 --> 27:13.355
Well, there's plenty more
where we came from, right?

27:13.699 --> 27:17.465
The perilous nature of this mission
should not be taken lightly.

27:17.569 --> 27:21.300
There is a chance that the Prometheus
may not survive this voyage.

27:21.406 --> 27:25.467
But courage and a steadfast resolve
will prove the most valuable assets

27:25.577 --> 27:27.568
in this undertaking.

27:29.881 --> 27:31.974
Well, good luck to you all.

27:35.921 --> 27:37.479
I miss Thor.

27:43.128 --> 27:46.097
Of course, by the time he actually
got around to drinking that orange juice,

27:46.198 --> 27:48.428
it'd been sitting in the back of the fridge
for, what, a month?

27:48.533 --> 27:49.864
Yeah, yeah, yeah! Oh!

27:49.968 --> 27:52.436
He was so damned thirsty,
he knocked it right back.

27:52.537 --> 27:55.267
It was a second or two before
he actually breathed in, at which point...

27:55.374 --> 27:57.535
The spit-take of all spit-takes.

27:57.642 --> 28:00.076
There was orange juice on the table,
the chairs...

28:00.178 --> 28:01.873
-On Aunt Emma.
-Aunt Emma.

28:02.647 --> 28:05.377
Big, old, fat Emma sitting across the table.

28:05.484 --> 28:08.510
Little bits of bacon on her face.
Orange juice dripping off her nose.

28:08.653 --> 28:09.711
(BOTH LAUGHING)

28:09.888 --> 28:11.651
Reminiscing over old times?

28:11.757 --> 28:14.351
Yeah, hell, I could talk to this guy all day.

28:14.459 --> 28:16.825
-No doubt.
-You finish your shift?

28:16.962 --> 28:19.556
Yeah, I'm exhausted. I'm going to bed.

28:20.098 --> 28:22.328
Speaking of which,
I think it's past my bedtime.

28:22.434 --> 28:24.664
And you need your beauty sleep.

28:24.770 --> 28:26.635
Oh, look who's talking.

28:33.478 --> 28:34.570
So how'd it go?

28:34.679 --> 28:38.308
I found a way around
all the security protocols. Everything's set.

28:38.417 --> 28:39.611
Perfect.

28:40.252 --> 28:44.211
By the time they figure out
what happened, it'll be too late.

29:02.674 --> 29:03.902
Showtime.

29:11.783 --> 29:14.183
CARTER 2: We're approaching
the singularity.

29:20.926 --> 29:24.259
Calculating minimal prime distance
to warhead launch.

29:45.584 --> 29:47.142
Come on, Carter.

30:09.574 --> 30:12.168
I've got it. Relaying the information.

30:13.912 --> 30:15.209
Received.

30:15.447 --> 30:18.848
Engaging sublight engines.
Proceeding to coordinates.

30:23.788 --> 30:26.052
We've reached the target location.

30:26.591 --> 30:27.785
Yeah, I heard.

30:27.893 --> 30:31.124
Yeah, I think they're just circling,
looking for parking.

30:40.705 --> 30:41.899
(GRUNTING)

30:46.745 --> 30:48.372
I should warn you,

30:48.747 --> 30:51.409
I've been practicing those Sodan moves.

30:54.586 --> 30:56.144
You were warned.

30:58.890 --> 31:01.188
Wouldn't it have been easier
just to zat him?

31:01.293 --> 31:04.285
Easier, yes, but far less gratifying.

31:08.233 --> 31:10.064
Did he just insult me?

31:17.542 --> 31:19.100
What's going on?

31:21.179 --> 31:23.773
There's been a change of flight plans.

31:48.640 --> 31:51.040
You wanna tell us what's going on?

31:51.276 --> 31:53.540
We're making an unscheduled detour.

31:53.645 --> 31:57.137
Yeah? And just how far out of our way
is this little detour gonna take us?

31:57.248 --> 31:58.875
About three weeks.

32:00.018 --> 32:03.078
You're planning on taking this ship
to Atlantis.

32:03.355 --> 32:05.448
CARTER: Given the parallels
between our two realities,

32:05.557 --> 32:07.149
I can't think of anywhere else
we'd be going.

32:07.258 --> 32:08.657
As soon as we complete our mission,

32:08.760 --> 32:11.820
we'll drop you
at the nearest habitable planet.

32:11.930 --> 32:14.956
Until then, have fun.

32:18.570 --> 32:22.336
Three weeks. Well, that gives us time
to think of something.

32:23.742 --> 32:25.403
Ideas, anyone?

32:25.510 --> 32:28.035
Given the unique circumstance
we find ourselves in,

32:28.146 --> 32:31.343
it is possible to anticipate
their actions and reactions.

32:31.449 --> 32:33.974
All we must do is think like them.

32:34.085 --> 32:36.246
Well, it shouldn't be that hard.

32:54.939 --> 32:58.204
The other Colonel Mitchell
wishes to speak with you.

33:01.713 --> 33:05.114
You're just gonna ignore him
for the next three weeks?

33:16.661 --> 33:19.255
You guys seem reasonable.

33:19.964 --> 33:22.489
And you haven't hurt us much.

33:24.669 --> 33:28.935
You don't have beards, so you're not
from the evil twin universe, right?

33:29.040 --> 33:30.098
Good.

33:30.642 --> 33:33.133
All right, so, if I know me like I do,

33:33.978 --> 33:36.640
I'd have a pretty damn good reason
to be doing what you guys are doing.

33:36.748 --> 33:39.808
Bottom line is that I'd understand
better than anyone.

33:39.918 --> 33:41.408
So level with me.

33:41.519 --> 33:43.077
What's going on?

33:43.188 --> 33:45.179
Let me ask you something.

33:45.290 --> 33:49.590
How far would you go to save the lives
of every man and woman on Earth?

33:50.862 --> 33:53.888
Don't bother, I already know the answer.
And if you were in my situation,

33:53.998 --> 33:57.627
-you'd be doing the exact same thing.
-What, going after the ZPM?

33:59.037 --> 34:01.562
Come on, why else
would you go to Atlantis?

34:01.673 --> 34:03.436
Our ZPM is depleted.

34:05.243 --> 34:08.440
We need yours to power
the Ancient weapon in Antarctica.

34:08.546 --> 34:10.309
All right, screw our Earth
to save your own.

34:10.415 --> 34:12.542
All that ZPM is doing right now

34:12.650 --> 34:16.279
is allowing one-way travel
from the Pegasus Galaxy to Earth.

34:16.387 --> 34:20.585
The billions of lives that we save
is worth more than the inconvenience

34:20.692 --> 34:22.922
of schlepping back and forth
on the Daedalus.

34:23.027 --> 34:25.120
We need that ZPM to cloak Atlantis.

34:25.230 --> 34:28.165
If the Wraith come back
and discover the city wasn't destroyed,

34:28.266 --> 34:30.461
they'll launch another attack.

34:30.869 --> 34:32.461
If Atlantis falls,

34:33.037 --> 34:35.301
this galaxy is the next target.

34:35.807 --> 34:37.741
If the Wraith return.

34:38.409 --> 34:39.933
If they attack.

34:40.545 --> 34:42.513
If the city is destroyed.

34:43.047 --> 34:45.538
The threat we face is more immediate.

34:45.650 --> 34:48.778
That still doesn't give you the right
to do this.

34:49.654 --> 34:51.349
Well, say it works.

34:52.157 --> 34:55.854
Say that you can beam
the ZPM off Atlantis.

34:56.127 --> 34:59.392
How do you plan to get it back
to your own universe?

35:05.203 --> 35:06.932
You have a way back.

35:11.109 --> 35:13.304
You've planned this all along.

35:38.570 --> 35:41.698
Well, we were right.
They're going after the ZPM.

35:48.580 --> 35:50.707
Are you sure you can open the door?

35:50.815 --> 35:54.649
Hey, I helped build this thing.
Opening the door is the easy part.

35:54.752 --> 35:57.243
It's taking the ship back that'll be tricky.

36:07.332 --> 36:08.321
The armory is this way.

36:08.433 --> 36:10.298
No, Teal'c, go to the armory
on the next level.

36:10.401 --> 36:12.062
It's less likely you'll be spotted.

36:12.170 --> 36:15.105
Daniel and I will head to the engine room
and pull the control crystal.

36:15.206 --> 36:16.867
Once they come
to investigate the problem,

36:16.975 --> 36:18.602
we'll get the drop on them there.

36:18.710 --> 36:20.143
Very well.

36:39.564 --> 36:40.997
(BEEPING)

36:47.805 --> 36:51.002
Hey, you had to give it a shot.
I know I would.

36:53.978 --> 36:56.572
So now that we know
how you get out, well,

36:56.681 --> 36:59.878
we'll just have to make sure
it doesn't happen again.

37:03.855 --> 37:05.345
No hitting.

37:08.559 --> 37:10.356
So while we were up here...

37:10.461 --> 37:14.420
We were down on the next level
breaking into the other armory.

37:15.133 --> 37:17.101
How did you know I wasn't your Mitchell?

37:17.201 --> 37:20.637
Easy. If we were in your position,
we would have done the same thing.

37:20.738 --> 37:22.000
Let me get this straight.

37:22.106 --> 37:25.473
We figured that you guys would try
to escape, and we set this trap for you,

37:25.576 --> 37:30.070
not realizing that you'd figure out that
we'd figure you out and you set your own.

37:35.086 --> 37:36.212
Indeed.

37:36.321 --> 37:38.846
Now, can you take us
to our Colonel Mitchell?

37:52.470 --> 37:57.032
Sam disabled the power relay running
through these walls, so I wouldn't bother.

38:06.451 --> 38:07.918
Ideas, anyone?

38:13.791 --> 38:16.954
-Walter.
-Sir, it's a subspace communication

38:17.095 --> 38:18.995
-from the Prometheus.
-Let's hear it.

38:19.097 --> 38:20.758
-Yes, sir.
-Sir, this is Colonel Carter.

38:20.865 --> 38:24.164
Good to hear from you, Colonel.
I take it the mission was a success?

38:24.268 --> 38:27.237
No, sir. In fact, we're scrapping
the mission and heading back home.

38:27.338 --> 38:28.600
Colonel?

38:28.973 --> 38:33.433
Sir, I think I've figured out a way to send
these teams back to their proper realities.

38:33.544 --> 38:34.602
And how do we do that?

38:34.712 --> 38:38.842
By doing exactly the same thing
the first team did in order to get here.

38:41.619 --> 38:43.985
You're telling me they planned this
from the get-go?

38:44.088 --> 38:46.921
Yes, sir, it accounts for the boom
you heard and the extra energy signature

38:47.025 --> 38:49.926
the gate diagnostic picked up
in the first matter stream.

38:50.028 --> 38:51.859
They opened the wormhole
through the black hole

38:51.963 --> 38:54.727
and then blasted a bridge
into this universe.

38:54.832 --> 38:56.800
Isn't that how Carter described it?

38:56.901 --> 39:00.837
I don't know. I just remember,
"Wormhole, black hole, blast."

39:04.208 --> 39:05.607
MAN: Standing by.

39:16.220 --> 39:17.881
Colonel Carter.

39:18.222 --> 39:21.487
Sir, we've established a wormhole
to PX7-455.

39:22.026 --> 39:23.789
Now, when Sergeant Siler is finished,

39:23.895 --> 39:26.090
we'll fire the directed-energy weapon
through the gate.

39:26.197 --> 39:28.688
If I'm right,
it should reverse the space-time rupture,

39:28.800 --> 39:31.030
effectively inverting
the convergence effect.

39:31.135 --> 39:33.603
Each team gated in
from a different point of origin.

39:33.704 --> 39:35.831
Once the convergence effect has
been reversed,

39:35.940 --> 39:37.430
we'll dial those different points of origin

39:37.542 --> 39:40.340
and create wormholes that will follow
the interuniversal pathways

39:40.445 --> 39:42.276
already created by their initial trips here.

39:42.380 --> 39:44.712
I got it. I got it. They're going back.

39:48.519 --> 39:51.682
-Ready when you are, sir.
-Clear the gate room.

39:53.391 --> 39:56.827
I will need the weapon back
once your work here is completed.

39:56.928 --> 40:00.659
It is, after all,
only on loan to you temporarily.

40:01.499 --> 40:03.467
I know. You'll get it back when we're done.

40:03.568 --> 40:05.468
Lower the blast door.

40:09.807 --> 40:11.468
Fire the weapon.

40:22.286 --> 40:25.449
We have a stable wormhole, 3.4 seconds.
It worked.

40:25.556 --> 40:28.047
Open the blast doors. Bring them in.

40:47.945 --> 40:49.537
Hey, Mitchell.

40:50.581 --> 40:52.276
When the time comes,

40:52.884 --> 40:54.681
cut the green one.

41:07.765 --> 41:09.630
What the hell did that mean?

41:09.734 --> 41:11.167
I don't know.

41:12.603 --> 41:15.868
I have a feeling that someday
you're gonna find out.

41:34.458 --> 41:37.552
-Have all the other teams left, sir?
-You're the last ones to go.

41:37.662 --> 41:40.358
It was nice working with you again, Sam.

41:41.699 --> 41:44.395
Your presence has been sorely missed
on our team.

41:44.502 --> 41:47.096
Just out of curiosity, where did I go?

41:50.041 --> 41:51.599
Maternity leave.

41:57.949 --> 41:59.940
We have something for you.

42:02.019 --> 42:04.385
The cure to the Prior's plague.

42:05.690 --> 42:07.385
Thank you, General.

42:13.464 --> 42:16.024
-It's good to see you again.
-You too.

42:25.910 --> 42:28.003
May it not be the last time.

42:32.783 --> 42:36.685
Well, we'd love to stay,
but we have a planet to save.

42:41.726 --> 42:42.784
Bye.
