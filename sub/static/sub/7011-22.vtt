00:03.969 --> 00:06.063
- Hi.
- Hi.

00:06.139 --> 00:09.074
- What you doing?
- Oh, just writing in my journal.

00:09.142 --> 00:11.576
Like in <i>Star Trek?</i>

00:13.346 --> 00:17.612
Captain's log, stardate 1978.

00:17.684 --> 00:20.653
God, I'm so hot.

00:20.720 --> 00:23.883
My beautiful red hair and giant jugs...

00:23.957 --> 00:28.724
seem to...
drive all life-forms wild.

00:28.795 --> 00:32.128
Oh, my God, Eric.
That's exactly what I was writing.

00:35.502 --> 00:38.960
I'm gonna go make some popcorn
and get some sodas.

00:39.039 --> 00:42.065
My beautifully sculpted hindquarters...

00:42.142 --> 00:45.111
flounce downstairs to...

00:46.146 --> 00:48.080
procure nourishment.

00:48.148 --> 00:50.981
- Shut up.
- Okay.

00:53.887 --> 00:56.981
Eric.

00:57.057 --> 00:59.548
Eric.

00:59.626 --> 01:02.322
Yes, Donna's journal?

01:03.463 --> 01:05.954
I am the book of secrets, Eric.

01:06.032 --> 01:09.365
Don't you wanna know what
she <i>really</i> thinks about you?

01:09.436 --> 01:11.996
Read me. <i>Read me.</i>

01:12.072 --> 01:14.302
You know, I really shouldn't.

01:14.374 --> 01:16.342
Suit yourself.

01:22.015 --> 01:23.949
But beware...

01:24.017 --> 01:28.511
what you learn here
cannot be unlearned.

01:28.588 --> 01:31.079
Okay, do you want me
to read you or not?

01:31.157 --> 01:33.682
Sorry.

01:33.760 --> 01:36.593
<i>Eric and I went to second base tonight.</i>

01:36.663 --> 01:38.756
<i>He was hilarious.</i>

01:42.168 --> 01:46.730
<i>The prom is gonna be magical. I think</i>
<i>tonight I'm finally gonna sleep with Eric.</i>

01:48.808 --> 01:51.800
<i>Which is like Woodstock,</i>
<i>but for vans.</i>

01:51.878 --> 01:54.972
<i>Anyway, I think I'm finally</i>
<i>gonna sleep with Eric.</i>

01:55.048 --> 01:57.539
<i>I love him so much.</i>

01:57.617 --> 02:01.280
<i>Tonight I'm finally</i>
<i>gonna sleep with Eric.</i>

02:03.957 --> 02:07.256
Okay, let's just skip to the last page.

02:07.327 --> 02:09.818
<i>I had the weirdest dream</i>
<i>about Eric last night.</i>

02:09.895 --> 02:13.127
<i>He was Eric, but he was also</i>
<i>Steven Tyler from Aerosmith...</i>

02:13.199 --> 02:15.463
<i>and he looked really wicked</i>
<i>and dangerous.</i>

02:17.137 --> 02:19.605
Yeah! Wicked and dangerous.

02:19.672 --> 02:21.663
<i>Which is so not Eric.</i>

02:24.677 --> 02:27.441
<i>Sometimes I wish he were like that.</i>

02:27.514 --> 02:30.108
Quick! Put me down!
Someone's coming!

02:32.185 --> 02:34.244
Hi! Hello.

02:34.320 --> 02:38.051
How are you? I didn't do anything.
You look pretty.

02:40.000 --> 02:46.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:16.462 --> 03:20.193
Hey! Glad you're back.
I missed you so.

03:26.005 --> 03:29.270
- Did you read my journal?
- What journal?

03:29.342 --> 03:33.369
You know, my captain's log.

03:33.446 --> 03:36.279
No. Oh! No.

03:36.349 --> 03:38.579
I was just, uh...

03:38.651 --> 03:42.985
I was, uh, going through
your underwear drawer.

03:43.056 --> 03:48.221
Yeah. I know.
That's why I look so guilty.

03:48.294 --> 03:50.285
Because I was, like, you know...

03:50.363 --> 03:54.800
taking out your underwear
and rubbing it against my skin.

03:56.636 --> 04:00.902
I can't stay away from your underwear.
That's my curse.

04:00.974 --> 04:03.807
So, anyway, see you tomorrow.

04:05.778 --> 04:09.771
Gong him. Gong him! Gong him!

04:13.486 --> 04:15.511
Yes!

04:15.588 --> 04:19.820
This isn't gonna work, Jackie.

04:19.892 --> 04:22.360
What, Michael?

04:22.428 --> 04:25.420
This isn't gonna work, Jackie.

04:27.333 --> 04:31.429
- What? What isn't gonna work?
- I'm sorry, but you and I...

04:31.504 --> 04:34.473
- They're here! They're here!
- What? What?

04:34.540 --> 04:37.338
- Oh, my God! Michael, what'd you say?
- Huh? I said, "What?"

04:39.045 --> 04:41.980
My X-ray specs are here.

04:42.048 --> 04:44.539
According to the ad
in the <i>Richie Rich</i> comic...

04:44.617 --> 04:47.142
with these, you can see
through a lady's clothes.

04:50.023 --> 04:52.821
Okay, Jackie, prepare to be ogled.

05:03.002 --> 05:04.936
Swindled again.

05:08.474 --> 05:10.772
Kitty, where's the Band-Aids?

05:10.843 --> 05:13.835
I cut my thumb with a hacksaw.

05:13.913 --> 05:18.282
Oh, Red, you know those things
are dangerous.

05:18.351 --> 05:21.843
Well, I tried cutting
the metal pipe with a flower...

05:23.856 --> 05:26.791
but it was real slow going.

05:28.361 --> 05:32.559
Well, seeing as how
you're being all snarky anyway...

05:34.267 --> 05:38.363
may as well tell you,
Pastor Dave is coming to dinner tonight.

05:40.173 --> 05:43.870
Not tonight!
There's a <i>Packer Report</i> on tonight.

05:43.943 --> 05:46.002
They're doing a tribute
to Vince Lombardi.

05:46.079 --> 05:50.038
Red, you know I'm trying to get more involved
with the church, so he is coming.

05:50.116 --> 05:53.142
Kitty, if Pastor Dave comes over,
we'll never get rid of him.

05:53.219 --> 05:57.883
He'll just go on and on
about how great God is.

06:04.197 --> 06:06.131
Well, he is.

06:07.967 --> 06:10.629
He said,
"This isn't going to work, Jackie."

06:10.703 --> 06:13.194
What if Michael secretly
wants to break up?

06:13.272 --> 06:15.604
I need to get him to sleep again.

06:15.675 --> 06:19.805
What if his unconscious mind knows
something his conscious mind doesn't?

06:27.186 --> 06:29.177
Well, let's hope so.

06:31.324 --> 06:33.485
At least he's not as boring as Eric.

06:33.559 --> 06:36.824
We're not talking about Eric.
We're talking about Kelso.

06:36.896 --> 06:41.890
Untrustworthy, two-timing, sneaks-around-
behind-your-back-and-reads-your-journal Kelso.

06:45.004 --> 06:49.668
Okay, Donna, I'm sensing we're not talking
about me and Michael anymore...

06:49.742 --> 06:52.575
so... bye!

06:52.645 --> 06:56.081
Ow! Don't pinch me, you lumberjack!

06:57.650 --> 07:00.949
Jackie, I think Eric read
my private journal.

07:01.020 --> 07:05.389
Oh. Is this about the dream where
you wished Eric was Steven Tyler?

07:07.693 --> 07:11.026
Hey, do you know who I really love?

07:11.097 --> 07:13.725
- Jesus.
- Well, yes.

07:13.800 --> 07:16.360
But I was going to say Vince Lombardi.

07:18.337 --> 07:23.001
- You're a Packer man?
- Are you kidding? I bleed cheese.

07:23.075 --> 07:26.875
Well, I'm not sure, but I think there
may be a <i>Packer Report</i> on tonight.

07:26.946 --> 07:29.437
Red, I think you might be right.

07:29.515 --> 07:31.983
I think it could start
in eight and a half minutes.

07:32.051 --> 07:35.282
Then what do you say we choke our dinners
down, get our asses on the couch?

07:35.354 --> 07:37.549
Amen!

07:37.623 --> 07:42.390
Red, can you help me
in the kitchen, please?

07:42.462 --> 07:44.453
Right now, please?

07:50.169 --> 07:52.899
Red, this night is not about football.

07:52.972 --> 07:54.940
This night is about company.

07:55.007 --> 07:57.567
And our company wants
to watch the <i>Packer Report.</i>

07:57.643 --> 08:01.374
He spends his life
doing the Lord's work...

08:01.447 --> 08:04.905
and if you would deny
this holy little man...

08:04.984 --> 08:07.976
that simple pleasure...

08:08.054 --> 08:10.989
well, God have mercy
on your soul.

08:12.124 --> 08:14.854
Just can it, Red.
Bring him his food.

08:16.295 --> 08:18.263
You got six minutes.

08:18.331 --> 08:20.322
I'm eating!

08:26.672 --> 08:30.369
- Where is your Band-Aid?
- Oh, I don't know. I had it on a second ago.

08:30.443 --> 08:32.910
Must have come off
while I was serving the...

08:38.317 --> 08:40.615
Done!

08:47.660 --> 08:50.424
Hey, Leo, thanks
for letting us hang out here.

08:50.496 --> 08:53.795
I just... I didn't want to see Donna
after what she wrote.

08:53.866 --> 08:56.266
Forman, no one cares.

08:57.537 --> 09:00.199
That's true, man.

09:00.273 --> 09:04.369
Listen, you guys know
I don't allow alcohol in my house...

09:04.443 --> 09:07.435
so you're just gonna have
to drink sake instead.

09:12.952 --> 09:15.785
"Sake" it to me, Leo.

09:15.855 --> 09:18.688
Don't start with the sake jokes, Fez.

09:18.758 --> 09:21.090
Oh, put a "sake" in it.

09:24.163 --> 09:27.530
Well, this would be fun
if I wasn't so miserable.

09:27.600 --> 09:30.262
Look, Forman,
we're happy to sit here...

09:30.336 --> 09:34.204
and drink these tiny
allegedly alcoholic drinks...

09:34.273 --> 09:37.106
but we don't wanna hear you
bitch about Donna all night.

09:37.176 --> 09:41.670
Oh. Don't worry, Hyde.
I don't feel like talking about Donna.

09:45.885 --> 09:49.377
You see, the thing about Donna is...

09:49.455 --> 09:51.946
Here we go.

09:52.024 --> 09:55.357
She acts like everything's all cool, okay?

09:55.428 --> 09:58.591
And then, all of a sudden...

09:58.664 --> 10:01.792
I'm no Steven Tyler.

10:01.867 --> 10:04.529
Oh, Eric, give it up, for heaven's "sake."

10:10.409 --> 10:12.400
You're still the king, man.

10:14.780 --> 10:18.375
Man, I thought we were past the phase
where we had to impress each other.

10:18.451 --> 10:20.385
You are.

10:20.453 --> 10:25.083
Now you're in the she-dumps-you-
for-a-biker-with-a-wicked-tattoo phase.

10:25.157 --> 10:27.648
The most entertaining of all phases.

10:28.961 --> 10:31.259
Oh, my God.

10:31.330 --> 10:33.321
Oh, my God, Hyde! That's it!

10:33.399 --> 10:36.027
A tattoo's dangerous!

10:36.102 --> 10:40.698
There's a place next to the liquor store.
I could go get one right now.

10:40.773 --> 10:44.504
No way, man.

10:47.213 --> 10:50.705
We're not gonna let you go
to some sleazy tattoo parlor...

10:50.783 --> 10:55.777
and spend money for something
you'll regret for the rest of your life.

10:55.855 --> 10:59.188
I'll tattoo you for free, man.

10:59.258 --> 11:02.750
I'm pretty sure
I used to do this for a living.

11:13.371 --> 11:15.362
How cool am I?

11:17.475 --> 11:19.807
A tattoo of my girlfriend's name.

11:19.878 --> 11:22.711
How's that for dangerous?

11:22.781 --> 11:25.944
Yeah, I think Debbie's
really gonna like this.

11:28.019 --> 11:30.510
Wait. Debbie? No. Donna.

11:32.023 --> 11:33.957
Right.

11:36.862 --> 11:39.422
Okay. No problem.

11:39.497 --> 11:43.058
- I can fix it.
- Fix what?

11:43.134 --> 11:45.625
Relax. Debbie will never notice it.

11:46.938 --> 11:48.963
It's Donna.

11:49.040 --> 11:51.770
See, now you moved, man!

11:51.843 --> 11:54.835
It's okay.
I can make that into a flower.

11:56.314 --> 12:00.478
Oh, you know what you should get?
Boobs.

12:01.920 --> 12:04.013
Big boobs on your butt.

12:04.089 --> 12:06.614
That's classy.

12:06.691 --> 12:09.182
Hey, I can turn the B's into boobs.

12:10.929 --> 12:13.193
Wait. What B's?

12:14.499 --> 12:18.799
Like in Debbie, your girlfriend?

12:18.870 --> 12:20.804
It's Donna!

12:21.873 --> 12:23.807
Oh, right.

12:25.243 --> 12:27.973
Oh, I can fix that.

12:29.314 --> 12:31.305
Hey. Jackie.

12:31.383 --> 12:35.444
Hey, Michael.
I'm really glad you're here.

12:35.520 --> 12:38.250
Okay! Time to go to sleep!

12:38.323 --> 12:41.815
Oh, sleep? Whoa!
I thought we were gonna do it.

12:43.061 --> 12:45.791
Michael, I invited you over
for a sleepover...

12:45.864 --> 12:47.855
not a do-it over.

12:49.234 --> 12:52.135
Okay? I told you.
We're gonna wait until we're ready.

12:52.203 --> 12:54.194
So, uh, go to sleep.

12:55.373 --> 12:58.035
No, Jackie, I'm not tired.

12:59.210 --> 13:01.610
But, you know...

13:01.680 --> 13:05.343
I always get tired right after.

13:05.417 --> 13:07.908
Yeah, you don't have to tell me,
Michael.

13:10.488 --> 13:13.480
I know! We'll read out loud. Yeah!

13:13.558 --> 13:18.427
I'll be Nancy Drew,
and you could be her pudgy friend Bess.

13:18.496 --> 13:21.431
Oh, damn it! I'm always Bess.

13:25.971 --> 13:28.963
And then Bart Starr
fakes a handoff to Anderson...

13:29.040 --> 13:33.204
and finds Dowler in the end zone
for the winning touchdown!

13:33.278 --> 13:35.769
Wow, on TV it seemed confusing...

13:35.847 --> 13:38.338
but with peanuts, it's all so clear.

13:40.085 --> 13:44.613
- Can I see you in the kitchen for a minute, please?
- Yeah, just one second.

13:44.689 --> 13:48.022
You go ahead and set 'em up again, and I'll
show you how the Packers won the Ice Bowl.

13:48.093 --> 13:50.084
All right!

13:52.864 --> 13:56.664
Okay, Red, don't you think it's time
your little friend went home?

13:58.036 --> 14:00.698
Kitty, I'm just being sociable,
like you asked.

14:00.772 --> 14:03.172
- Just being a good host.
- Oh, sure.

14:03.241 --> 14:07.575
All good hosts feed
their guests Band-Aids.

14:07.645 --> 14:11.137
Band-Aid, Kitty. Don't exaggerate.

14:21.292 --> 14:24.284
Oh, my God!

14:27.032 --> 14:29.523
Hospital, please.

14:32.470 --> 14:36.031
"And Nancy Drew and Bess
left the police station...

14:38.009 --> 14:42.173
and went to celebrate the solving
of the crime with hot fudge sundaes."

14:44.215 --> 14:46.149
The end.

14:46.217 --> 14:48.879
Wow.

14:48.953 --> 14:51.319
Nancy's so smart.

14:52.991 --> 14:55.551
Read another one.

14:55.627 --> 14:57.561
Fine.

14:57.629 --> 15:01.725
Okay, <i>Nancy Drew</i>
<i>and the Mysterious Charming Clock.</i>

15:04.803 --> 15:08.034
"And they celebrated the solving
of the mystery of the clock...

15:08.106 --> 15:11.007
with hot fudge sundaes."

15:11.076 --> 15:13.010
The end.

15:13.078 --> 15:16.912
Guess we solved the mystery
of why Bess was so pudgy.

15:26.157 --> 15:28.648
This isn't going to work, Jackie.

15:30.028 --> 15:32.690
What isn't going to work?

15:32.764 --> 15:35.927
I can't sleep with you staring at me.

16:11.903 --> 16:14.770
Eric, how did you get so hot?

16:16.141 --> 16:18.837
I got a tattoo.

16:22.447 --> 16:24.881
Eric's perfect.

16:33.925 --> 16:36.018
Oh, yeah. Ow.

16:36.094 --> 16:38.028
Ow.

16:39.564 --> 16:41.498
Oh, yeah.

16:46.137 --> 16:51.006
So, are you telling me
that you fed me a Band-Aid?

16:52.911 --> 16:55.812
Well, um, to be honest...

16:55.880 --> 16:58.007
Red fed you the Band-Aid.

17:00.518 --> 17:03.009
How did this happen?

17:03.087 --> 17:06.853
Red, why don't you diagram it
for him with peanuts?

17:09.327 --> 17:12.626
Look, Dave, I'm real sorry.

17:12.696 --> 17:16.133
I didn't realize how sick
a Band-Aid would make you.

17:16.201 --> 17:20.194
Well, thank you
for your belated honesty...

17:20.271 --> 17:25.470
but the doctor said I had food poisoning
from an undercooked sausage.

17:25.542 --> 17:29.445
<i>Food poisoning?</i>
<i>That's Kitty's department.</i>

17:32.217 --> 17:35.050
I have never undercooked
a sausage in my life.

17:35.119 --> 17:37.917
I have a system. It's foolproof.

17:37.989 --> 17:40.981
Hey, Kitty, it's okay.

17:41.059 --> 17:43.152
We all make mistakes.

17:43.228 --> 17:45.560
I...

17:45.630 --> 17:50.033
Vince Lombardi is overrated.
That's right. He is overrated.

17:51.469 --> 17:53.699
Ignore her. She's hysterical.

17:58.243 --> 18:00.734
This isn't going to work, Jackie.

18:02.580 --> 18:05.481
Us, Michael?
Are we not gonna work?

18:05.550 --> 18:08.519
No. The car.

18:08.586 --> 18:11.578
Jackie, the carburetor's busted.

18:14.092 --> 18:17.084
This was all because of a stupid car?

18:17.161 --> 18:20.096
We're gonna have to
take the bus to our wedding.

18:22.934 --> 18:25.061
Our wedding?

18:25.136 --> 18:28.299
Oh, Michael. That is so sweet.

18:28.373 --> 18:30.671
I love you, Michael Kelso.

18:30.742 --> 18:33.404
I love you too, Jackie Onassis.

18:56.467 --> 18:58.731
Eric, what the hell?

18:59.971 --> 19:01.962
Did you just kick my door?

19:03.841 --> 19:05.866
No.

19:05.943 --> 19:08.503
But I got a surprise.

19:10.114 --> 19:14.517
I got a tattoo.
Guess where. On my butt.

19:14.585 --> 19:16.416
Why?

19:18.423 --> 19:20.584
Why?

19:20.658 --> 19:24.025
Because I'm dangerous, lady.

19:27.865 --> 19:32.029
Eric, I want you to be honest with me,
and I promise I won't get mad.

19:33.438 --> 19:36.066
Did you read my journal?

19:36.140 --> 19:40.133
Um, yeah.

19:40.211 --> 19:42.805
You sneaky little dill-hole!

19:42.880 --> 19:45.178
No! You know who's sneaky?

19:45.249 --> 19:48.241
People who go around writing
their feelings in their journals...

19:48.319 --> 19:50.810
and not telling their boyfriends
what they feel.

19:50.888 --> 19:53.379
So, you know what? I'm not sorry.

19:53.458 --> 19:55.983
I'm so sorry.

19:57.695 --> 20:01.324
You want to know how I feel?
Fine. I'll tell you how I feel.

20:01.399 --> 20:04.061
"Today at lunch I was looking at Eric
when he didn't know it...

20:04.135 --> 20:08.196
and I just couldn't believe how much I
love him and how lucky I am to be with him."

20:08.272 --> 20:12.265
- Why couldn't you read that page?
- Because you came back.

20:15.513 --> 20:17.640
Look, Donna...

20:19.484 --> 20:24.183
Look, I'm really sorry, but, you know,
it's just sometimes I get...

20:24.255 --> 20:26.189
worried, you know?

20:26.257 --> 20:29.852
Well, you know what?
Suck it up.

20:31.763 --> 20:34.926
Eric, these are my private thoughts,
and I'm allowed to have them.

20:34.999 --> 20:37.991
You have to stop trying to be
what you think I want you to be...

20:38.069 --> 20:41.129
and just, like, be yourself.

20:42.774 --> 20:46.266
- Okay. I think I'm gonna go.
- Well, wait.

20:46.344 --> 20:48.642
Take off your pants.

20:49.680 --> 20:53.207
Really? All right.

20:53.284 --> 20:55.275
No. To show me your tattoo.

20:55.353 --> 20:57.844
- I knew that. Yeah. I knew that.
- Right. Yeah.

20:57.922 --> 21:00.413
I think you're really gonna like it.

21:00.491 --> 21:03.517
Just don't be mad if it says "Debbie."

21:14.839 --> 21:17.307
Woodstock.

21:17.375 --> 21:19.866
It says "Woodstock"?

21:23.247 --> 21:26.512
No, it's a picture
of Snoopy's friend Woodstock.

21:31.689 --> 21:35.022
You have a little yellow bird
on your ass.

21:39.263 --> 21:42.061
If properly executed...

21:42.133 --> 21:45.796
the power sweep is unstoppable.

21:47.338 --> 21:51.775
Oh, Red, this is silly.
I don't wanna run this play again.

21:51.843 --> 21:55.506
Well, we're gonna run it
until we get it right...

21:55.580 --> 21:58.242
because, if properly executed...

21:58.316 --> 22:01.479
the power sweep is unstoppable!

22:01.552 --> 22:04.385
- Hut-one, hut-two.
- Who wants cookies?

22:04.455 --> 22:06.889
- Oh, absolutely.
- Yeah.
