00:00.352 --> 00:01.900
Previously on The Fosters...

00:01.924 --> 00:03.863
- Taking out the trash?
- Hey!

00:03.879 --> 00:05.772
Last night, Lexi and I had sex...

00:05.803 --> 00:08.132
but we needed the morning after pill.

00:08.164 --> 00:09.260
So now what?

00:09.292 --> 00:10.817
Have you thought any more
about talking to your mom?

00:10.856 --> 00:11.990
If she ever found out,

00:11.990 --> 00:13.093
that you guys gave me the pill,

00:13.124 --> 00:14.391
she'd go crazy.

00:14.391 --> 00:16.870
I did it, so that you did not have to.

00:18.059 --> 00:19.521
Hey, what's he doin' here?

00:19.641 --> 00:20.569
I invited him.

00:20.592 --> 00:22.100
I don't want you dating Wyatt,

00:22.101 --> 00:24.259
because I don't want you dating anyone.

00:24.265 --> 00:25.791
Yeah, well, even having this conversation,

00:25.792 --> 00:26.792
could get me and Jude
kicked out of the house.

00:27.576 --> 00:28.483
That would never happen.

00:28.522 --> 00:29.680
Brandon, it can happen...

00:34.309 --> 00:36.891
I'll take Jude to his tutor,
then drop Jesus at practice.

00:36.925 --> 00:39.560
Mike is taking Brandon to his
audition while you're at your dad's.

00:39.594 --> 00:40.861
How long do you think you're going to be?

00:40.896 --> 00:43.764
Not long, just enough to stock
the fridge, say hello, you know.

00:43.799 --> 00:45.399
Good morning, sweets.

00:45.434 --> 00:47.668
- Good morning.
- Good morning, sleepy head.

00:47.703 --> 00:50.371
Is this thing supposed to itch?

00:50.405 --> 00:52.173
That's a excellent question,

00:52.207 --> 00:54.475
one you should have posed before
you stuck a needle in your face.

00:54.509 --> 00:56.344
Oh, since you're going to the store,

00:56.378 --> 00:58.245
will you pick up a couple bottles of white?

00:58.280 --> 01:00.081
Yeah. What's wrong with what we have?

01:00.115 --> 01:01.882
We're not serving wine in a box.

01:01.917 --> 01:04.185
Ok, fancy-pants. But it's Lexi's parents.

01:04.218 --> 01:05.986
We're not trying to impress them.

01:06.021 --> 01:09.790
Jesus' relentless micromanagement
would suggest otherwise...

01:09.825 --> 01:12.727
Speaking of which, you're
still welcome to join us.

01:12.761 --> 01:15.696
I'm sure the Riveras would love to see you.

01:15.764 --> 01:18.699
Or not. Well, you're up
and at 'em this morning.

01:18.734 --> 01:21.469
- I got to practice.
- You were up practicing pretty late night.

01:21.503 --> 01:22.603
It's a big day.

01:25.507 --> 01:28.275
He stresses himself out every
time he has an audition like this.

01:28.310 --> 01:33.013
- I know. He'll be fine.
- Brandon wake you up, too?

01:33.048 --> 01:35.349
- He's supposed to be wearing his headphones.
- He is. You can hear him

01:35.384 --> 01:37.885
banging on his keyboard through the walls.

01:37.919 --> 01:39.220
It's like a construction site in there.

01:39.254 --> 01:43.224
Oh, everybody's up. Before 10:00.
What kind of teenagers are you?

01:43.258 --> 01:46.127
Not Jude. That kid could
sleep through the apocalypse.

01:46.161 --> 01:48.829
Did you guys decide what we're
having for dinner tonight?

01:48.864 --> 01:52.566
As a matter of fact, I do believe
we're starting with some caviar,

01:52.601 --> 01:55.469
then lobster tails with Belgian escarole,

01:55.504 --> 01:57.371
and a side of truffled potatoes...

01:57.406 --> 01:59.440
- Seriously?
- No, of course not.

01:59.474 --> 02:01.442
Mama's making halibut.

02:01.476 --> 02:02.643
I just want to impress them.

02:02.677 --> 02:04.445
If we have to have caviar to impress them,

02:04.479 --> 02:07.281
we're not going to make the
cut. What are you so nervous for?

02:07.315 --> 02:09.449
This isn't a sit-down like The Godfather.

02:09.484 --> 02:12.019
The Riveras just want to be sure

02:12.053 --> 02:14.121
both families are on the same page.

02:14.156 --> 02:17.158
We'll do our best to assure them
we're not running a teen brothel,

02:17.192 --> 02:20.761
but we're not going to pretend
to be something we aren't.

02:20.796 --> 02:21.896
I know, they're just old school.

02:21.930 --> 02:23.063
Oh, Callie.

02:23.098 --> 02:26.000
Are you ok to walk to your
support group, tonight?

02:27.636 --> 02:29.737
Um, yeah.

02:30.972 --> 02:32.640
Did you take those?

02:32.674 --> 02:34.608
It's not like it requires talent.

02:34.643 --> 02:36.477
I just clicked a button.

02:40.315 --> 02:42.216
No, these are great.

02:42.250 --> 02:43.584
Is this something you're into, photography?

02:43.618 --> 02:45.486
I mean, I guess.

02:45.520 --> 02:48.489
You better run and get a
shower before you're late.

02:48.523 --> 02:50.257
Ok.

02:51.226 --> 02:53.194
Oh, I almost forgot.

02:53.228 --> 02:56.130
Let me guess, you'd like
us to use the fine china?

02:56.164 --> 02:58.199
Lexi's parents are chaperoning
a retreat next weekend,

02:58.233 --> 02:59.934
and I really want to go.

02:59.968 --> 03:04.004
Um, hello. We have the
adoption fair next weekend.

03:04.039 --> 03:06.874
- Since when are you religious?
- Since when are you a hipster?

03:06.908 --> 03:08.943
Ok. Enough.

03:08.977 --> 03:11.545
We'll not make any
promises, Jesus, but we'll...

03:11.580 --> 03:12.546
we'll look into it.

03:15.383 --> 03:17.618
You never invited Lexi's parents
over when we were friends.

03:19.621 --> 03:21.222
Ok, church camp?

03:21.256 --> 03:23.390
So, we can subject our son to people

03:23.425 --> 03:26.594
who don't approve of our family? Um, no.

03:28.000 --> 03:34.074

04:11.139 --> 04:13.140
I figured, hey, it's
still technically "ours",

04:13.174 --> 04:14.508
I might as well throw one last party.

04:14.543 --> 04:17.511
You're not upset the bank's foreclosing

04:17.546 --> 04:19.480
on the only home you've ever lived in?

04:19.514 --> 04:22.149
That's like me throwing a party
every time I got yanked out of

04:22.183 --> 04:24.418
one foster home and dropped in another.

04:24.452 --> 04:27.087
It's just a house.

04:28.557 --> 04:30.457
Is this really your house?

04:30.492 --> 04:33.260
'Cause, last time we went to your house,

04:33.295 --> 04:35.229
I almost got arrested.

04:38.366 --> 04:40.234
Come see.

04:46.575 --> 04:49.543
How hard is it to sneak
into a place with a marker?

04:53.181 --> 04:54.315
Look.

05:01.456 --> 05:03.223
You did this?

05:03.258 --> 05:06.360
Yeah, when I was little.

05:07.429 --> 05:11.498
I started in fourth grade.

05:11.533 --> 05:15.369
When life sucked I'd go
in there and just... draw.

05:20.075 --> 05:21.175
This is stupid...

05:21.209 --> 05:24.078
No, it's not stupid.

05:26.214 --> 05:29.316
- I want to see more.
- You want to see more of me?

05:29.351 --> 05:33.520
Oh, you're really incapable of being
serious for more than 30 seconds.

05:33.555 --> 05:36.156
Do you want me to be serious?

05:36.191 --> 05:38.425
Let's talk about us. What are we?

05:40.261 --> 05:43.430
Are we dating? What do you call
this thing that we're doing?

05:48.370 --> 05:51.438
I do not get you.

05:53.141 --> 05:55.376
I feel like I'm a girl
in this relationship.

05:55.410 --> 05:58.345
Relationship?

06:07.222 --> 06:10.324
If you could only see how
ridiculous you look right now.

06:14.329 --> 06:16.397
Come tonight.

06:16.431 --> 06:18.198
No...

06:18.233 --> 06:19.433
I want you at my party.

06:19.467 --> 06:23.103
No way. Wyatt, I'm on probation.

06:23.138 --> 06:26.140
One close call is enough for me.

06:27.208 --> 06:29.309
It's just a little get together.

06:31.079 --> 06:33.080
Sorry, I have to go.

06:34.315 --> 06:36.350
- Got a hot date?
- Yeah.

06:36.384 --> 06:38.352
With a bunch of angry foster kids.

06:38.386 --> 06:44.191
- Why don't you blow it off?
- It's required. Bye.

07:09.117 --> 07:10.784
Very nice.

07:10.819 --> 07:12.553
Oh, sorry. Was it too loud?

07:12.587 --> 07:13.921
I took my headphones
off, my ears were hurting.

07:13.955 --> 07:15.856
No, no, no. It was beautiful.

07:15.890 --> 07:19.693
Well... we'll see.

07:19.728 --> 07:22.429
I just wanted to wish you
luck before I head out.

07:22.464 --> 07:25.432
We won't be back before your dad
comes to pick you up this afternoon.

07:25.467 --> 07:29.303
- You need anything?
- Um, I'm good. Thanks.

07:32.073 --> 07:34.007
Hey...

07:35.977 --> 07:38.045
I have all the confidence in the world

07:38.079 --> 07:39.313
that you're going to impress this guy,

07:39.347 --> 07:42.983
but this audition can't be the
be-all, end-all of your life.

07:43.017 --> 07:44.718
He's just a piano teacher.

07:44.753 --> 07:48.989
No. No, he's not. He's one
of the best in the state.

07:49.068 --> 07:51.570
Well, he'd be lucky to have you.

07:51.604 --> 07:54.740
He didn't exactly feel that way
last year or the year before that.

07:56.743 --> 07:59.511
We're proud of you. No matter what.

08:03.583 --> 08:06.185
Whoa, where are you headed in such a hurry?

08:07.387 --> 08:10.155
- Garret invited me to lunch.
- Ohh.

08:10.190 --> 08:12.357
You two are spending quite a
bit of time together these days.

08:12.392 --> 08:14.927
Can I go? We were just
going to meet at Paco's.

08:14.961 --> 08:16.995
Sure, I was just about to
leave, I can drop you off.

08:18.131 --> 08:21.767
Ok. But, can we hurry?
I don't want to be late.

08:24.904 --> 08:27.840
Sounds like you dealt with
that really well, Nicole.

08:27.874 --> 08:29.541
Thank you.

08:31.678 --> 08:35.647
Sarah, we haven't heard from you yet.

08:35.682 --> 08:38.717
Well, um...

08:38.751 --> 08:42.587
after a few misses, I think
my third foster home's a match.

08:42.621 --> 08:46.225
The Olmsteads have really gone out
of their way to make me feel welcome.

08:46.259 --> 08:48.215
They don't introduce me
as their "foster daughter,"

08:48.216 --> 08:49.216
and they take me everywhere.

08:49.529 --> 08:53.932
It's nice to feel like I
belong. Even if it is temporary.

08:55.068 --> 08:57.736
And we lived happily ever after.

08:57.770 --> 09:00.706
Ok. Thanks for that, Sarah.

09:00.740 --> 09:02.741
It's time to break,

09:02.775 --> 09:11.717
but I hope next week we'll all participate.

09:11.751 --> 09:14.720
- Such a waste, right?
- Oh. Yeah.

09:14.754 --> 09:17.623
I can't believe they make us
do this crap on a Saturday.

09:17.657 --> 09:20.325
- I know, right?
- Hey, um...

09:20.360 --> 09:23.262
Do you want to talk about
it over coffee or something?

09:23.296 --> 09:25.430
- My treat.
- Yeah.

09:25.465 --> 09:27.299
Yeah, just let me text my foster mom.

09:27.333 --> 09:28.967
Yeah.

09:44.651 --> 09:45.951
You came.

09:51.770 --> 09:53.971
Wow. Your folks must be mad, huh?

09:54.006 --> 09:57.775
Well, they're not exactly happy.

09:57.809 --> 10:01.579
I like it.

10:01.613 --> 10:04.582
I'm sure you'd rather be
hanging with your friends

10:04.616 --> 10:06.651
on a Saturday afternoon,
so thank you for coming.

10:06.685 --> 10:10.454
Well, my weekends are
pretty boring these days.

10:11.356 --> 10:12.490
Don't you have a boyfriend?

10:12.524 --> 10:14.158
Pretty girl like you.

10:14.193 --> 10:16.360
And where are your girls?

10:16.395 --> 10:18.930
I remember when I was your age,

10:18.964 --> 10:21.899
I would not go anywhere
without my girl Nati.

10:21.934 --> 10:27.038
Well, my Nati's name is
Lexi and we aren't talking.

10:27.072 --> 10:30.541
- What'd she do?
- It's complicated.

10:32.578 --> 10:33.744
Try me.

10:33.779 --> 10:36.514
She's been hooking up
with Jesus behind my back.

10:36.548 --> 10:40.351
Oh, man. Yeah, that sucks.

10:45.457 --> 10:47.358
Um...

10:47.392 --> 10:50.061
I was surprised to hear from you again.

10:50.095 --> 10:54.265
Last time, you...

10:54.299 --> 10:56.534
you know, took off so fast.

10:56.568 --> 10:58.369
Yeah.

10:59.238 --> 11:02.340
Well, this is awkward.

11:04.142 --> 11:07.078
I don't have anymore money,
if that's what you mean.

11:07.112 --> 11:10.715
Oh, no. No, God, no.

11:10.749 --> 11:13.985
I was thinking about
you on your birthday...

11:15.721 --> 11:17.655
wishing I was there.

11:17.689 --> 11:20.491
Wondering if you even
got to have a Quinceanera.

11:22.894 --> 11:24.695
I did, yeah.

11:24.730 --> 11:26.631
That's so nice.

11:28.400 --> 11:29.533
I bet it was wonderful.

11:29.568 --> 11:31.402
Oh, yeah.

11:31.670 --> 11:33.337
It was amazing.

11:33.372 --> 11:36.374
Well, I wish I could've seen it.

11:38.937 --> 11:40.772
Anyway...

11:44.810 --> 11:46.677
I wanted to give you something.

11:49.782 --> 11:51.616
Wow.

11:52.851 --> 11:54.685
My God, thank you.

11:54.720 --> 11:58.456
- Do you like it.
- I love it.

12:11.303 --> 12:14.272
Dad, you were supposed to
be here like 20 minutes ago!

12:14.306 --> 12:16.841
I'm going to miss this
audition, where are you?

12:18.921 --> 12:20.955
Hi Dad!

12:20.990 --> 12:23.624
- There's my favorite daughter.
- You're only daughter.

12:23.659 --> 12:24.759
But I'm relieved I made the list.

12:24.793 --> 12:25.960
- Here, let me help you.
- I got it.

12:25.995 --> 12:27.862
I'm not an invalid.

12:27.896 --> 12:29.697
You don't have to keep
doing this, you know.

12:29.732 --> 12:33.568
If I don't stock the fridge you'll
live on sodium-packed TV dinners.

12:33.422 --> 12:35.323
- It's bad for your heart.
- Come on, you're nuts.

12:35.357 --> 12:37.225
Your mother and I raised you on TV dinners.

12:37.259 --> 12:40.395
And I still have nightmares about
frozen peas and Salisbury steak.

12:40.429 --> 12:43.298
Spoke to mom last night by the way.

12:43.182 --> 12:44.916
She sends her regards from Florida.

12:44.950 --> 12:46.951
Good for her.

12:48.754 --> 12:50.622
See the Padres game last night?

12:50.656 --> 12:53.458
You mean the massacre?
Barely heard the last inning.

12:53.492 --> 12:55.560
Jesus was screaming at the TV.

12:55.594 --> 12:57.796
You got to love that kid.

12:57.830 --> 13:00.732
I should take him to a game since
baseball isn't Brandon's thing.

13:00.766 --> 13:03.501
They would both love an invite, Dad.

13:03.536 --> 13:05.470
Just not next weekend,

13:05.504 --> 13:08.239
Jesus wants to go to Bible camp.

13:08.274 --> 13:09.674
Come again?

13:09.709 --> 13:14.012
Your grandson wants to go to
church camp. Catholic church camp.

13:14.046 --> 13:17.182
Catholic? You're not raising
the kids Catholic, are you?

13:17.216 --> 13:19.117
Please, Dad. You know we don't do church.

13:19.151 --> 13:22.053
Don't you think they need a church
though? A good Christian church?

13:22.088 --> 13:23.822
I never understood why you stopped.

13:23.856 --> 13:25.957
- You're kidding, right?
- What?

13:27.093 --> 13:30.662
You never understood why I stopped?

13:30.696 --> 13:33.565
I know you remember Tess, Tess
Brown, my friend from high school?

13:33.599 --> 13:35.533
Yeah. Her.

13:35.568 --> 13:38.369
Her. You sent me to see a youth minister

13:38.404 --> 13:39.571
because you caught us
"cuddling" on the couch.

13:39.605 --> 13:41.306
Even though we weren't doing anything.

13:41.340 --> 13:43.208
Was only trying to help.

13:43.242 --> 13:45.376
How? You never talked to me about it.

13:45.411 --> 13:47.245
You never asked me anything.

13:47.279 --> 13:49.981
All you did was lock me
in a room with some man,

13:50.015 --> 13:52.250
who proceeded to tell me
that being gay was a sin.

13:52.284 --> 13:56.988
I was being a parent, I was
pushing you in the right direction.

13:57.022 --> 13:59.157
Well, I was completely humiliated.

13:59.191 --> 14:01.860
That's why you stopped going to church?

14:01.894 --> 14:03.728
One meeting 20 years ago?

14:03.763 --> 14:05.797
How could I ever go back, Dad?

14:05.831 --> 14:09.434
I didn't want you to make wrong choices.

14:09.468 --> 14:11.636
I'm just saying!

14:11.670 --> 14:14.339
You had a husband, and a son.

14:14.373 --> 14:18.376
And you still left Mike for
Lena. You had everything,

14:18.410 --> 14:20.345
and made the choice to be gay.

14:20.379 --> 14:23.548
It's not a...

14:25.251 --> 14:28.119
Oh, my God.

14:28.154 --> 14:31.122
Ok, let's pretend it is a choice, Dad.

14:32.091 --> 14:33.992
At the end of the day,

14:34.026 --> 14:36.928
who I love shouldn't be an
issue for you, or anyone else.

14:36.962 --> 14:41.666
I have an amazing family.
Lena is an amazing woman,

14:41.700 --> 14:43.701
whom I absolutely adore.

14:43.736 --> 14:47.605
So, yeah. I made a choice.

14:47.640 --> 14:49.774
I made a choice to be happy, Dad.

14:49.809 --> 14:53.311
I don't want to get into this right now.

15:05.257 --> 15:07.892
You're welcome for the groceries, Dad.

15:15.701 --> 15:17.902
Sorry, I fell asleep watching the game.

15:17.937 --> 15:20.038
Yeah, well, it's the
middle of the freaking day.

15:20.072 --> 15:23.942
- I said I'm sorry.
- Yeah, I heard you.

15:26.779 --> 15:29.514
- I get my own room.
- You're lucky.

15:29.548 --> 15:33.484
When I first moved in to my new
house my roommate totally hated me.

15:33.519 --> 15:36.321
- She come around?
- Yeah.

15:36.355 --> 15:39.257
We'd probably never hang out if we weren't

15:39.291 --> 15:40.592
forced to live under the same roof,

15:40.626 --> 15:45.163
but as far as foster siblings
go, I guess she's cool.

15:47.233 --> 15:52.070
So, what about you? Any
other kids at the Olmsteads?

15:52.104 --> 15:55.106
One. He's older, he's out of high
school, but he still lives at home.

16:01.747 --> 16:02.536
That's cute.

16:03.048 --> 16:05.258
Give me your Instagram
handle and I'll tag you.

16:09.788 --> 16:13.458
So, this boy. Is he cute?

16:13.492 --> 16:15.426
Do you hang out? What do you do?

16:16.495 --> 16:18.329
Jeez, you ask a lot of questions.

16:18.364 --> 16:22.166
Sorry. I live with four other kids, so...

16:23.369 --> 16:26.170
Well, he and his dad like golf.

16:26.205 --> 16:28.973
Like, a lot. Like, obsessed.

16:29.008 --> 16:31.876
One time we went mini-golfing,
you know, as a family,

16:31.911 --> 16:35.113
and he got so pissed when he missed
this easy putt that he broke his club.

16:35.147 --> 16:36.881
Like, in half!

16:36.916 --> 16:40.718
Wait, who? Liam or his dad?

16:42.855 --> 16:45.556
I never said his name was Liam.

16:47.459 --> 16:48.660
You sure?

16:48.694 --> 16:50.395
I'm pretty sure you did.

16:50.429 --> 16:53.431
No, um...

16:53.465 --> 16:55.433
I've got to go.

17:06.318 --> 17:08.019
Looks like you're having
a rockin' Saturday.

17:08.053 --> 17:11.321
The sunset looks cool
behind your elm tree. Look.

17:13.058 --> 17:15.093
Pretty.

17:15.127 --> 17:17.762
It's kind of your tree, too, you know?

17:21.633 --> 17:24.801
I never really noticed,
but Wyatt's super cute.

17:24.837 --> 17:26.804
You think?

17:26.839 --> 17:29.741
He's sexy. Like, messy-sexy.

17:29.775 --> 17:31.709
Ok.

17:33.479 --> 17:35.513
So, what's up with you two anyway?

17:35.547 --> 17:38.449
Don't most girls with boyfriends
consider Saturday date night?

17:38.484 --> 17:39.723
Not my boyfriend.

17:39.724 --> 17:42.801
And even if he was, he's
having a party tonight, so...

17:43.589 --> 17:44.507
Ok, excuse me?

17:45.108 --> 17:47.579
He's having a party tonight,
and we're sitting here?

17:48.794 --> 17:51.863
- We have to go.
- Ok, it's not like you're missing prom or anything.

17:51.897 --> 17:53.831
It's just a stupid foreclosure party.

17:53.866 --> 17:56.901
I don't want to be home when Lexi
and her parents get here, please...

17:56.935 --> 18:00.772
and admit it, you don't want to be
stuck here on a Saturday night either.

18:00.806 --> 18:04.809
- And you totally like Wyatt.
- Fine. Ok.

18:04.843 --> 18:08.446
- If you really want to go.
- Yay!

18:08.480 --> 18:11.215
- Don't force it.
- It's stuck, can you hold on...

18:11.250 --> 18:14.185
There we go. Ok. Sorry.

18:14.219 --> 18:16.120
It's just a dinner party, babe.

18:16.155 --> 18:19.190
It's not dinner, it's my dad. He just...

18:19.224 --> 18:21.225
I don't know, maybe it is the dinner.

18:21.260 --> 18:24.929
What, we're supposed to sit there
and make nice with these people

18:24.963 --> 18:28.066
who are trying to "save"
Jesus or something?

18:28.100 --> 18:30.201
Jesus isn't looking for
a religious experience,

18:30.235 --> 18:32.170
he wants to spend the
weekend with his girlfriend.

18:32.204 --> 18:34.806
I'm sure he'd rather
be going to Disneyland.

18:34.840 --> 18:36.741
But before you jump to any conclusions,

18:36.775 --> 18:38.709
let's talk it over with the Riveras, ok?

18:38.744 --> 18:43.414
I'm telling you this, I will
not be judged in my own house.

18:43.449 --> 18:46.417
You know what? We owe it
to Jesus to find out more

18:46.452 --> 18:48.319
about the camp before we shut it down.

18:49.390 --> 18:51.124
Probably think we're a couple of heathens

18:51.158 --> 18:54.127
who let our children run
amuck without any supervision.

18:54.161 --> 18:56.329
If the Riveras had any problems with us

18:56.363 --> 18:59.165
they wouldn't have allowed Lexi to
sleep over with Mariana all the time.

18:59.199 --> 19:02.068
And Lexi and Jesus did have sex.

19:02.102 --> 19:04.837
Not in the house.

19:07.041 --> 19:08.875
Save some for the Riveras, please.

19:08.909 --> 19:10.977
Whatever you're cooking smells amazing.

19:11.011 --> 19:13.713
Mama's cooking halibut
and grilled asparagus.

19:13.747 --> 19:15.915
- Mm...
- Still time for you to join us.

19:15.949 --> 19:17.784
Actually, we were thinking about

19:17.818 --> 19:20.520
getting out of the house and
watching a movie at Wyatt's.

19:20.554 --> 19:23.589
The hair model? Oh, we like him.

19:23.624 --> 19:26.292
- Both of you?
- Mm-hmm.

19:26.326 --> 19:27.727
- Together?
- Yes.

19:27.761 --> 19:30.229
Wyatt's parents gonna be there?

19:30.264 --> 19:31.531
Um, hello?

19:31.565 --> 19:33.533
It's Wyatt's parents' house?

19:33.567 --> 19:36.517
Ok, the two of you may go.
Be home by 10:00, please.

19:36.518 --> 19:38.380
Call if you need a ride.

19:38.472 --> 19:40.039
Have fun.

19:46.313 --> 19:48.948
What? I didn't lie.

19:51.051 --> 19:53.786
I'm sorry he made you
wait and audition last,

19:53.821 --> 19:55.721
but you're going to
blow him away I know it.

19:55.756 --> 19:57.590
Ok, Dad. All right.

19:57.624 --> 19:59.892
No, I'm serious. You're gonna make
him forget anyone else played today.

19:59.927 --> 20:02.495
- Dad, seriously.
- Sorry.

20:02.529 --> 20:04.597
I don't know who's more nervous, me or you.

20:04.631 --> 20:07.700
All right, I'm going to take a walk, Dad.

20:07.734 --> 20:09.469
Thank you very much.

20:13.173 --> 20:15.274
Brandon Foster?

20:16.410 --> 20:18.111
Good luck, buddy.

20:50.377 --> 20:53.479
Um, I'm sorry. Can I start again?

20:54.581 --> 20:57.049
Ok.

21:25.196 --> 21:26.963
Oh, my God. We should go.

21:26.998 --> 21:28.732
Oh, hells no.

21:28.766 --> 21:30.000
Mariana.

21:30.034 --> 21:32.535
Ok, look, if you're going to drink...

21:32.570 --> 21:34.671
just have one and sip it all night.

21:34.705 --> 21:37.741
God, don't worry. You act like
I've never been to a party before.

21:37.775 --> 21:40.844
- Hey, girl!
- Hey!

21:52.189 --> 21:55.325
- Wyatt.
- Hey, you made it!

21:55.359 --> 21:57.394
Yeah, Mariana needed a babysitter, so...

21:57.428 --> 22:00.063
Oh, way to make a boy feel special.

22:02.066 --> 22:04.067
Guess I'm stoked you came at all.

22:04.101 --> 22:07.971
Want a spray can, marker,
glow-in-the-dark paint pen?

22:08.005 --> 22:09.973
Thought you were just
having a little get together?

22:10.007 --> 22:12.008
Is that not what this is?

22:12.043 --> 22:15.812
What exactly are you trying to
accomplish by destroying your house?

22:15.846 --> 22:20.717
I am giving the bank a
remodel. Free of charge.

22:20.751 --> 22:22.452
Everyone's destroying
the house you lived in

22:22.486 --> 22:24.320
your whole life and you don't even care?

22:24.355 --> 22:25.522
Don't tell me what I care about.

22:25.556 --> 22:27.257
- I'm just...
- You know what?

22:27.291 --> 22:29.159
Have fun babysitting.

22:40.838 --> 22:42.005
I didn't think I'd run into you here,

22:42.039 --> 22:44.941
especially with juvie girl, but... yay!

22:44.975 --> 22:47.744
Her name's Callie and she's fine.

22:47.778 --> 22:49.646
Ok, what did I miss?

22:49.680 --> 22:50.947
A lot.

22:52.983 --> 22:56.453
Wow. Looks like rehab really did the trick.

22:56.487 --> 22:59.689
Aren't you supposed to be, you know, sober?

22:59.724 --> 23:02.592
Hello, I went to rehab for pills, not beer.

23:02.626 --> 23:04.327
And obviously, my parents overreacted.

23:04.361 --> 23:07.430
- Obviously.
- Cheers.

23:08.566 --> 23:11.134
Well, it's delicious.

23:11.168 --> 23:12.402
Thank you.

23:17.975 --> 23:20.777
- Thank you for having us.
- Absolutely.

23:20.811 --> 23:24.981
When Lexi asked for our
permission to date Jesus,

23:25.015 --> 23:26.816
you can imagine our hesitation.

23:26.851 --> 23:29.586
Well, she's 15 now,

23:29.620 --> 23:33.656
and if she wants to start dating,
that's fine, but we do have concerns.

23:33.691 --> 23:36.693
But if she's going to keep spending
time here, not as Mariana's friend,

23:36.727 --> 23:39.596
but as Jesus' girlfriend,
we need to set some rules.

23:39.630 --> 23:40.273
We agree.

23:40.574 --> 23:44.776
Boundaries are essential, and
curfews, no closed doors...

23:45.102 --> 23:46.302
How about supervised visits only?

23:46.337 --> 23:48.438
- Mami.
- Meaning...

23:48.416 --> 23:50.984
If Lexi and Jesus start
spending time together,

23:51.019 --> 23:55.889
it'll be in a common area where
siblings or parents will be present.

23:55.924 --> 23:57.891
We want you to feel
comfortable having her here,

23:57.926 --> 23:59.827
and we love Lexi like she was our own...

23:59.861 --> 24:01.929
But we don't want our kids to feel
like we're breathing down their necks.

24:01.963 --> 24:03.797
Well, that's exactly what we want.

24:04.933 --> 24:07.501
- She's joking.
- Yes.

24:07.535 --> 24:10.504
Well, a little.

24:10.538 --> 24:12.506
We aren't sure how we feel about Lexi

24:12.540 --> 24:15.309
spending the night with Mariana anymore.

24:16.644 --> 24:19.413
Um, excuse me. I'll get it, hon.

24:20.448 --> 24:23.217
Sorry for the interruption.

24:23.251 --> 24:24.451
More wine anyone?

24:24.486 --> 24:27.187
- Fill 'er up.
- He's kidding.

24:27.222 --> 24:30.257
Um... honey, look who's here.

24:30.291 --> 24:33.894
I, I didn't realize you had company. Hello.

24:33.928 --> 24:35.162
Dad.

24:35.196 --> 24:38.899
Uh, Ernie and Sonia Rivera,
this is my dad, Frank.

24:38.933 --> 24:40.768
- Hi, how do you do?
- Great to meet you.

24:40.802 --> 24:42.736
Nice to meet you. Pleasure.

24:42.771 --> 24:44.004
- Hey, Gramps.
- How are you, kiddo?

24:44.038 --> 24:47.875
- What's up, Dad?
- You know what? I'm going to go.

24:47.909 --> 24:49.843
We were just about to start.
Would you like to join us?

24:49.878 --> 24:54.414
Uh... sure, ok. Love to.

24:57.519 --> 24:59.319
Uh...

24:59.354 --> 25:01.221
I'll go get another plate.

25:05.260 --> 25:07.194
Hey.

25:08.163 --> 25:10.097
Been looking for you. How'd it go?

25:10.131 --> 25:12.399
Can we go?

25:12.433 --> 25:14.067
No, not until you tell me how it went.

25:14.102 --> 25:16.303
You were late.

25:16.337 --> 25:19.139
- Brandon, I'm sorry.
- And you stink like booze.

25:19.174 --> 25:21.041
You really think I wouldn't notice?

25:21.075 --> 25:22.142
Did you think it wouldn't matter?

25:22.177 --> 25:26.980
- What happened in there?
- I screwed up, ok?

25:27.015 --> 25:31.652
I failed performing a song that I've
played perfectly a thousand times.

25:31.686 --> 25:34.655
So, let's go.

25:34.689 --> 25:36.590
Wait here.

25:37.826 --> 25:40.327
- Dad, what are you doing?
- Just give me a second.

25:40.361 --> 25:41.428
Dad...

25:41.462 --> 25:43.330
It's my fault he wasn't at his best.

25:43.364 --> 25:46.533
I was late picking him up, could
you just please let him play again?

25:46.568 --> 25:50.204
- It's been a long day, ok?
- Look, I understand that.

25:50.238 --> 25:53.173
But, you're missing out.
He's really amazing...

25:53.208 --> 25:54.441
- I'm sorry, let's go...
- Give him another shot.

25:54.475 --> 25:55.238
Please?

25:56.239 --> 25:59.769
Come on, don't make the
kid pay for my screw up.

26:11.926 --> 26:13.994
Oh, yeah. I totally get why
you're still pissed at Lexi,

26:14.028 --> 26:16.897
and it's crazy that your
parents are hanging out.

26:16.931 --> 26:18.899
It's kind of gross if you ask me...

26:18.933 --> 26:21.835
Oh, my God, do you think your
moms are telling the Riveras

26:21.870 --> 26:24.605
- they bought Lexi the pill?
- What?

26:24.639 --> 26:26.306
Lexi wanted my help getting
the morning-after pill.

26:26.341 --> 26:28.508
Hello, if you need a pill, call Kelsey...

26:28.543 --> 26:29.933
after she and Jesus had sex.

26:29.934 --> 26:32.063
I couldn't help, so I guess
they went to your moms.

26:34.315 --> 26:36.216
Oh, you didn't know?

26:38.219 --> 26:39.920
Oops.

26:48.029 --> 26:49.790
And you should have seen Papi's face

26:49.791 --> 26:52.639
when he got to the top,
he a almost backed out.

26:54.172 --> 26:57.341
That was my first and
last zip-line adventure.

26:57.375 --> 27:01.245
Lexi's such a good girl, but she's
always getting me into trouble.

27:02.881 --> 27:07.785
So, Jesus... tell me about this camp.

27:07.819 --> 27:09.053
What do you want to know?

27:09.087 --> 27:11.722
Well, what do you, as a non-Catholic,

27:11.756 --> 27:14.658
expect to get out of
this Catholic Bible camp.

27:14.693 --> 27:16.760
Dad, we're not sure he's going yet anyway,

27:16.795 --> 27:18.662
- so let's not get ahead of ourselves.
- Oh, you're not?

27:18.697 --> 27:21.765
Uh, well, we have some concerns.

27:21.800 --> 27:24.435
There's nothing to be worried
about. We're chaperoning.

27:24.469 --> 27:26.236
It's going to be a great weekend.

27:26.271 --> 27:28.639
Completely supervised, separate
bunks for boys and girls.

27:28.673 --> 27:30.541
That's not exactly what
we're worried about.

27:30.575 --> 27:31.973
Our hesitation has nothing to do with

27:31.974 --> 27:34.666
chaperoning or sleeping arrangements.

27:36.247 --> 27:40.250
Our issue has to do...

27:40.285 --> 27:43.120
with a difference in core values, I think.

27:43.154 --> 27:47.725
We do not want to put Jesus
in any kind of situation

27:47.759 --> 27:52.696
where he might hear anything
negative about his family,

27:52.731 --> 27:57.735
or that his mothers' relationship
is wrong in the eyes of God.

27:57.769 --> 28:01.739
Oh, no. No, no, no. There's
been some misunderstanding.

28:01.773 --> 28:04.475
No, we would never let anyone ever...

28:04.509 --> 28:06.376
we totally support this family.

28:06.411 --> 28:09.446
- You do?
- Of course we do.

28:09.481 --> 28:11.281
What's more Christian than family?

28:23.762 --> 28:26.697
Do it, man! Let's break it! Break it!

28:26.731 --> 28:28.132
What the hell do I care?

28:30.802 --> 28:33.904
Going to burn the whole
freaking place down.

28:35.540 --> 28:37.541
Wyatt.

28:41.513 --> 28:43.680
Wyatt!

28:43.715 --> 28:47.584
I grew up in this house!

28:47.619 --> 28:51.388
My mom worked so hard to pay for it!

28:51.422 --> 28:54.458
They took it after a few missed payments!

29:01.166 --> 29:03.867
Hey... hey...

29:11.743 --> 29:14.778
It's just a house.

29:16.047 --> 29:19.750
It's not you, or your family,

29:19.818 --> 29:22.686
or your childhood. It's just a house.

29:22.720 --> 29:25.722
Some wood...

29:25.757 --> 29:29.726
and some stone, and glass.

29:31.729 --> 29:35.532
I never had a house. Not in my whole life.

29:35.567 --> 29:39.503
I'm sorry they're taking yours away, but...

29:39.537 --> 29:43.040
you don't have to let them
take away what matters.

29:43.074 --> 29:44.975
Ok?

29:46.144 --> 29:49.279
All the memories and stuff. That's yours.

29:50.915 --> 29:52.816
They can't have it.

29:55.086 --> 29:56.854
Ok?

30:00.024 --> 30:01.859
Ok?

30:14.772 --> 30:16.640
What are you doing?

30:41.866 --> 30:43.934
I'm keeping my memories and stuff.

30:50.842 --> 30:53.844
You want to get out of here?

30:53.878 --> 30:56.713
This party sucks.

31:02.320 --> 31:04.588
Um, I'm going to go find Mariana, ok?

31:06.557 --> 31:08.525
I'm going to wait outside.

31:13.264 --> 31:14.998
Hey, has anyone seen Mariana?

31:15.033 --> 31:16.199
No, I...

31:16.234 --> 31:19.937
- Oh, hey. Wait.
- Yeah?

31:19.971 --> 31:21.939
You're a cool girl, you know?

31:21.973 --> 31:24.975
You and Wyatt are like a thing, now?

31:25.009 --> 31:28.078
Funny. Everyone I liked, likes you.

31:28.112 --> 31:31.648
I told you that you had nothing
to worry about with me and Brandon.

31:31.683 --> 31:35.419
I know, I know. I freaked.

31:35.453 --> 31:38.388
Can you blame me? You're
the shiny new girl.

31:38.423 --> 31:42.492
I should've realized that
you were never into Brandon.

31:42.527 --> 31:44.261
He's into you

32:08.886 --> 32:13.557
You're very fortunate to have such a...

32:13.591 --> 32:16.526
relentless father.

32:16.561 --> 32:18.595
That was excellent. I'm impressed.

32:18.629 --> 32:22.399
But I'm sorry to say I can
not offer you a scholarship.

32:22.433 --> 32:24.368
I already gave that out this afternoon.

32:24.402 --> 32:26.503
- I understand.
- I'm not finished.

32:26.537 --> 32:29.373
I can't offer you a scholarship,

32:29.407 --> 32:31.341
but you have a lot of potential.

32:31.376 --> 32:35.979
So, I will make room in my schedule
to take you on as a student.

32:36.014 --> 32:38.181
Wow... thank you.

32:38.216 --> 32:40.784
Thank you so much. You
won't be disappointed.

32:40.818 --> 32:42.819
Good.

32:42.854 --> 32:46.857
It'll be $150 an hour, and a
minimum of two hours per week.

32:46.891 --> 32:49.659
Um... I'm sorry...

32:49.694 --> 32:52.896
Yeah, that's... I got it. That'll be fine.

32:52.930 --> 32:56.433
- Dad, no, you...
- Shh. I'm paying.

32:56.467 --> 32:58.735
- Thank you.
- All right.

32:58.770 --> 33:02.439
It's settled then. See you
at 5:00 on Monday, Brandon.

33:02.473 --> 33:05.108
- Yes, sir.
- And don't be late.

33:05.143 --> 33:08.111
Wait, wait, wait. I'm no Catholic,

33:08.146 --> 33:11.448
but the Church is not in favor of...

33:11.482 --> 33:13.950
- Dad...
- You know what I mean.

33:13.985 --> 33:17.187
Sorry, the Church is not in
favor of same-sex marriage.

33:17.221 --> 33:20.791
- Well, we are.
- How can you do that?

33:20.825 --> 33:24.661
How can you claim to be Catholics
and not follow the teachings of the...

33:24.695 --> 33:26.863
We don't have to
subscribe to every teaching

33:26.898 --> 33:28.899
or guideline to be good Catholics...

33:28.933 --> 33:30.767
or to be good people for that matter.

33:30.802 --> 33:32.502
Well, you can't just pick and choose.

33:32.537 --> 33:34.571
With all due respect, everybody does.

33:34.605 --> 33:37.507
Or else I could sell you
Lexi's hand in marriage.

33:37.542 --> 33:39.509
Or you could stone me to
death for contradicting you.

33:39.544 --> 33:42.279
And no one wants that, do they?

33:42.313 --> 33:43.447
But, I have to ask you,
you sit at this table

33:43.481 --> 33:45.415
and you call these people family,

33:45.450 --> 33:48.418
but you don't think your daughter
has a right to marry Lena?

33:48.453 --> 33:51.354
I believe that marriage is
between a man and a woman.

33:51.389 --> 33:53.323
All right, Dad.

33:53.357 --> 33:57.994
This is supposed to be a nice
dinner, not a religious symposium.

33:58.029 --> 34:01.031
You guys, there's nothing
anyone could say to change

34:01.065 --> 34:02.799
the way I feel about my family.

34:02.834 --> 34:04.034
I don't want to go to the stupid camp

34:04.068 --> 34:06.837
if it's going to cause World War III.

34:06.871 --> 34:09.005
But seriously, Moms, have some faith in me.

34:16.714 --> 34:20.283
Hey. Hey, come on. Wyatt's
going to walk us home.

34:22.620 --> 34:27.456
Really? Oh, my God, your
moms are going to kill me.

34:27.492 --> 34:29.493
I'm fine.

34:32.295 --> 34:34.297
- My turn.
- Wait... Mariana, wait! No!

34:58.823 --> 35:00.824
Hey, Cal.

35:04.662 --> 35:06.496
Liam.

35:15.279 --> 35:17.047
Saw your shots on Instagram.

35:17.081 --> 35:20.250
- You're pretty good with that thing.
- What do you want?

35:20.284 --> 35:22.819
I heard you were asking
questions about me, so...

35:22.854 --> 35:25.856
I figured I'd save you some
time and catch up face-to-face.

35:25.890 --> 35:28.692
You look great.

35:28.726 --> 35:30.727
Can't believe how much
you've grown in two years.

35:30.761 --> 35:32.696
Look, when Sarah said she
was staying with your family

35:32.730 --> 35:34.631
I was just curious, that's all.

35:34.665 --> 35:37.501
- So, you missed me?
- I got to go.

35:37.535 --> 35:39.836
- Hey, I'm talking to you.
- Let go of me.

35:39.871 --> 35:41.705
I'm going to say this once,

35:41.739 --> 35:45.308
stop asking questions and
stay the hell away from Sarah.

35:46.344 --> 35:50.413
- Got me?
- Hey, everything ok here?

35:50.448 --> 35:52.482
Yeah, everything's great.

35:52.517 --> 35:54.384
Just catching up with an old friend.

35:54.418 --> 35:56.319
See you around, Cal.

35:56.354 --> 35:57.420
We got to go.

36:01.058 --> 36:02.325
Let's go.

36:10.935 --> 36:14.104
Hey! We're walking home.
Why don't you come with us?

36:14.138 --> 36:16.840
- Oh, no. I'm staying.
- Are you sure you're ok?

36:16.874 --> 36:18.875
I'm great.

36:22.046 --> 36:25.815
That... that halibut was great. Thanks.

36:25.850 --> 36:27.651
Yeah, of course.

36:27.685 --> 36:29.653
I can't remember the last time
that you joined us for dinner.

36:29.687 --> 36:31.855
I can't remember the last time I was asked.

36:31.889 --> 36:34.324
Yeah, sorry about that. That's on me.

36:34.293 --> 36:35.560
You're welcome here anytime, Dad.

36:35.595 --> 36:36.661
A phone call would've been nice.

36:36.696 --> 36:39.531
- Sorry about that.
- That's fine.

36:39.565 --> 36:42.434
It's just that... after our
little talk this afternoon

36:42.468 --> 36:44.302
I got to thinking and
I felt like I should...

36:44.337 --> 36:48.039
- That's fine, Dad.
- No, no.

36:48.009 --> 36:50.043
It's not.

36:50.078 --> 36:53.280
I need to apologize. I never
should've done that to you.

36:53.314 --> 36:57.017
Scared you like that when you were a kid.

36:57.051 --> 37:00.987
And if forcing you to talk to that minister

37:01.022 --> 37:04.691
drove a wedge between you and God...

37:06.994 --> 37:09.796
Well, that's the biggest sin of all.

37:09.831 --> 37:13.300
And I'm sorry. For that.

37:26.013 --> 37:27.314
You ok?

37:27.348 --> 37:31.985
He... he apologized.

37:32.019 --> 37:35.155
For the religious stuff.

37:35.189 --> 37:37.224
Not the...

37:37.258 --> 37:39.025
Wow.

37:39.060 --> 37:42.729
Look at that. People can surprise you.

37:42.763 --> 37:45.699
I think it's fine that
Jesus goes to the Jesus camp.

37:45.733 --> 37:48.568
I mean, they named it after him. Right?

37:48.603 --> 37:52.439
Yeah, well, let's spare the
Riveras that joke, shall we?

37:52.473 --> 37:54.541
Things are going so well.

37:56.511 --> 37:58.345
Look, I appreciate it, Dad, but I mean...

37:58.379 --> 37:59.613
we're not just talking
a couple classes here.

37:59.647 --> 38:01.448
We're talking 1,200 a month.

38:01.482 --> 38:03.450
Yeah, I can do the math.

38:03.484 --> 38:05.252
I'll pick up a few shifts,

38:05.286 --> 38:09.055
get a job doing security...
something. It's a couple extra hours?

38:09.090 --> 38:11.191
Dad, you don't have to...

38:11.225 --> 38:14.037
Stop it. I'm doing it and that's it.

38:14.038 --> 38:16.071
Let me be the hero for once.

38:21.169 --> 38:24.237
Shh!

38:24.272 --> 38:26.139
Quiet.

38:26.174 --> 38:29.109
Ooh. Shh...

38:29.143 --> 38:31.945
Ok...

38:31.979 --> 38:33.713
Hey...

38:38.085 --> 38:41.621
Chew and maintain.

38:44.025 --> 38:46.793
Shh!

38:50.898 --> 38:53.433
- Mariana?
- Callie, is that you?

38:53.467 --> 38:56.503
- Yeah.
- Come on in and say hello.

38:56.537 --> 38:57.737
Coming.

39:02.677 --> 39:05.512
Hi, Mari. So nice to see you.

39:05.546 --> 39:08.415
- Hello.
- Callie, this is Sonia and Ernie.

39:08.449 --> 39:10.217
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you.

39:10.251 --> 39:11.651
You, too.

39:11.686 --> 39:14.187
Um, we were just going to bed.

39:14.222 --> 39:18.258
No, no, Mari. It's been to
long. Come. Come join us.

39:23.331 --> 39:26.066
Wow. Mariana, your nose.

39:26.100 --> 39:27.267
You like it?

39:30.037 --> 39:33.106
Yeah, I think it's time we called
it a night. What do you say?

39:33.140 --> 39:35.175
Yeah, Mami, I'm tired.

39:35.209 --> 39:37.110
Ok...

39:37.144 --> 39:40.780
Mari, Jesus is going to join us
at the church retreat next weekend,

39:40.815 --> 39:43.016
- why don't you come, too?
- What?

39:43.050 --> 39:45.819
You're going to let them
spend the night together

39:45.853 --> 39:47.587
when you know they're having sex?

39:57.398 --> 39:59.599
You're drunk and you lied to us.

39:59.634 --> 40:02.602
Do you have anything to say for yourself?

40:02.637 --> 40:06.139
If your goal was to keep Jesus
and Lexi from seeing each other,

40:06.173 --> 40:09.342
you have certainly succeeded.

40:13.214 --> 40:16.349
We're going to continue this
conversation in the morning, young lady.

40:30.998 --> 40:32.999
Guess we should've made
her take the nose-ring out.

40:33.034 --> 40:35.835
If we made her take it out, she'd have
come home looking like a Lite-Brite.

40:38.072 --> 40:41.641
Sorry, I tried to get her out of there.

40:41.676 --> 40:44.577
Who's idea was it to go to this party?

40:46.914 --> 40:48.515
Was it Mariana's?

40:51.485 --> 40:53.420
Thank you very much for not drinking,

40:53.454 --> 40:54.788
and for getting her home in one piece.

40:54.822 --> 40:58.725
If this ever happens again,
please, please call us.

40:58.759 --> 41:02.495
- Understood?
- Yeah.

41:02.530 --> 41:04.397
Ok, get to bed.

41:15.209 --> 41:17.143
You ok?

41:19.046 --> 41:20.880
Mm-hmm.

41:41.936 --> 41:44.846
__

41:48.943 --> 41:51.155
