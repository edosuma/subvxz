08:21.900 --> 08:24.391
- Molly.
- Hey.

08:24.469 --> 08:26.369
Sure I can't give you
a ride home?

08:26.438 --> 08:30.135
Oh, thanks, Boone.
Alex is picking me up.

08:30.209 --> 08:32.200
But it's nice of you to ask.

08:33.645 --> 08:34.907
Well, it's late.

08:34.980 --> 08:36.572
It's cold.

08:36.648 --> 08:38.775
You think it's a good idea
for you to wait out here alone?

08:40.352 --> 08:43.150
- I could wait with you.
- I'll be fine.

08:44.823 --> 08:46.120
Good night, Molly.

08:46.191 --> 08:48.216
Good night, Boone.

08:57.636 --> 09:01.094
- Hey, Alex. Thanks.
- No problem.

09:14.152 --> 09:16.518
Alex, take it slow tonight?

09:16.588 --> 09:17.577
Why?

09:18.590 --> 09:22.424
I don't know. It's late.
I'm not as alert as I'd like to be.

09:22.494 --> 09:25.224
You're a passenger, Mol.
How alert do you have to be?

09:42.381 --> 09:43.541
What's he doing?

09:45.417 --> 09:46.406
Winking.

09:54.326 --> 09:55.953
He's getting over.

10:43.742 --> 10:45.039
Alex!

11:25.684 --> 11:27.549
Are you all right?

11:37.195 --> 11:38.184
Shit.

11:39.031 --> 11:40.225
Molly.

11:47.873 --> 11:49.135
Molly.

11:49.207 --> 11:51.903
- Are you all right?
- Yeah?

12:10.028 --> 12:11.928
Stay here.

12:11.997 --> 12:13.294
I'll go get help.

12:51.303 --> 12:52.361
Hey!

12:53.405 --> 12:55.134
Hey! Hey!

12:56.408 --> 12:59.002
Hey, damn it, we need help!

13:20.132 --> 13:23.226
No! No!

13:23.301 --> 13:26.600
No, please!

13:33.678 --> 13:34.667
Alex!

14:21.026 --> 14:22.721
Come back here!

14:41.479 --> 14:42.912
...<i>possible hit and run</i>,

14:42.981 --> 14:46.246
<i>Multiple-T.I. Accident</i>
<i>with kill injuries</i>.

14:46.318 --> 14:47.945
<i>Officer on scene not involved</i>.

15:01.366 --> 15:03.732
Hold it.
Hold it right there.

15:07.973 --> 15:10.203
Tunnel's closed.
This is an emergency lane.

15:10.275 --> 15:13.039
Will Macklin,
traffic investigator.

15:16.748 --> 15:17.737
Okay.

15:25.523 --> 15:26.922
T.I. Coming through.

15:27.993 --> 15:29.483
Clear a path, guys.

15:31.463 --> 15:33.431
Come on, get jumping.

15:33.498 --> 15:34.760
You're good. Go ahead.

15:50.181 --> 15:51.512
Hey, Jimmy.

15:52.751 --> 15:53.740
Bill.

15:53.818 --> 15:55.809
- What happened?
- We got a mess.

15:57.522 --> 15:59.456
Come on,
you remember how it was...

15:59.524 --> 16:02.152
it's great to be young and stupid
on a Saturday night.

16:02.227 --> 16:04.195
We've got three vehicles, four bodies,

16:04.262 --> 16:06.059
nothing ticking but their watches.

16:08.133 --> 16:09.828
White female, early 20s.

16:09.901 --> 16:11.801
Talk about a hard-on.

16:11.870 --> 16:13.861
You have a filthy mind, Jimmy.

16:13.938 --> 16:16.133
You ought to transfer to vice.

16:21.479 --> 16:22.639
Okay, move it back.

16:24.482 --> 16:26.575
There's a concrete post!

16:26.651 --> 16:27.811
We'll have to go low.

16:31.756 --> 16:33.849
Horse trailer must have
gone down first.

16:33.925 --> 16:36.689
That's how the animal's walking.
Then this baby comes along. Splat!

16:37.762 --> 16:40.424
First on the scene was that guy
over there with the dogs,

16:40.498 --> 16:42.090
but he didn't call it in.

16:42.167 --> 16:43.259
Who did?

16:43.335 --> 16:46.566
Wouldn't leave his name.
Came in on channel nine.

16:47.172 --> 16:49.936
- Nine? C.B.?
- Yeah.

16:50.008 --> 16:52.738
- People still use 'em?
- Ten-four.

17:28.480 --> 17:29.469
Hey!

17:30.548 --> 17:32.607
This look like a souvenir shop?

17:49.667 --> 17:51.259
Hey... hey!

17:51.336 --> 17:54.100
Hey, we got
a survivor here! Hey!

17:54.172 --> 17:56.231
Hey, up here!

17:56.307 --> 17:57.934
Let's go!

17:58.009 --> 18:00.068
Somebody...
get somebody over here!

18:56.801 --> 18:57.790
Come in.

19:01.139 --> 19:02.128
Molly?

19:03.208 --> 19:06.371
Will Macklin,
state traffic investigator.

19:06.444 --> 19:09.038
She's already said
everything she has to say.

19:09.113 --> 19:11.240
Not to me.

19:12.317 --> 19:13.306
It's okay.

19:15.119 --> 19:17.110
- I'll be right outside.
- Okay.

19:19.591 --> 19:21.286
Please, sit.

19:27.298 --> 19:29.698
You must feel that we
don't do our job very well

19:29.767 --> 19:31.792
for something like this
to happen to you...

19:32.804 --> 19:34.203
...twice.

19:35.273 --> 19:37.207
This isn't the same.

19:37.275 --> 19:38.674
No, of course not.

19:38.743 --> 19:42.736
The other was worse, I'd guess,
losing your family like that.

19:42.814 --> 19:44.543
I've seen it
take down grown men.

19:45.617 --> 19:47.915
You must have been
a tough little girl.

19:51.523 --> 19:53.320
I was just wondering...

19:54.526 --> 19:55.959
What?

19:57.028 --> 19:59.360
...if it wouldn't skew
what you saw,

19:59.430 --> 20:01.057
shade your thinking a little.

20:03.501 --> 20:05.628
It shades my life.

20:05.703 --> 20:08.228
So it's conceivable
that you got things wrong?

20:10.041 --> 20:11.372
He saw her.

20:11.543 --> 20:13.135
He toyed with her.

20:13.311 --> 20:15.438
He killed her,

20:15.513 --> 20:17.640
and then he came after me.

20:20.585 --> 20:23.952
Don't suppose you know
anything about skid marks?

20:25.023 --> 20:26.615
No.

20:26.691 --> 20:29.785
Well, rubber on asphalt
is like ink on paper.

20:29.861 --> 20:32.261
Tires may not
know how to spell,

20:32.330 --> 20:36.266
but the marks they leave
are a language, just the same.

20:36.334 --> 20:38.268
And what do they say?

20:38.336 --> 20:42.295
There were a lot of people in that tunnel
trying to avoid one another.

20:42.373 --> 20:45.103
One guy
doing just the opposite.

20:46.177 --> 20:48.304
It almost sounds like
you believe me.

20:48.379 --> 20:50.279
What are you gonna do about it?

20:51.282 --> 20:54.342
Molly,
I'm not a homicide detective.

20:54.419 --> 20:56.785
I don't even carry a gun,
just a measuring tape

20:56.854 --> 20:58.879
and a pencil.

20:58.957 --> 21:02.791
I never made an arrest in my life.
Never shot anyone.

21:07.699 --> 21:09.929
You said the vehicle was big.

21:10.001 --> 21:11.161
American, maybe.

21:11.235 --> 21:13.669
Old. Possibly green.

21:14.672 --> 21:16.867
What else can you tell me
about it?

21:19.344 --> 21:20.333
Filthy.

21:41.699 --> 21:44.964
Okay, let me start by confessing

21:45.036 --> 21:48.904
that I've never actually
been in an accident,

21:48.973 --> 21:50.702
but I know what you're thinking...

21:51.709 --> 21:52.698
...feeling.

21:53.711 --> 21:56.202
You're saying to yourself,
"Why me?"

21:57.281 --> 22:00.409
Yes, well,
it didn't just happen to you.

22:01.486 --> 22:02.612
In America,

22:02.687 --> 22:06.919
300 of us are seriously injured
in a motor vehicle accident

22:06.991 --> 22:08.288
every hour.

22:09.293 --> 22:12.387
That's over 8,000 of us a day,

22:12.463 --> 22:14.761
250,000 a month.

22:14.832 --> 22:17.858
That's over three million a year.

22:17.935 --> 22:21.735
50,000 of us die.

22:23.341 --> 22:26.640
The person next to you,
take their hand.

22:28.446 --> 22:29.538
Take it.

22:30.114 --> 22:32.241
Come on, take it.

22:32.316 --> 22:34.147
That's it.

22:34.218 --> 22:35.981
I want you to do something
for me.

22:36.521 --> 22:42.551
I want you to say,
"I am not alone."

22:42.627 --> 22:47.030
Say it with me.
"I am not alone."

22:47.098 --> 22:48.087
Good. Again.

22:48.166 --> 22:52.000
I am not alone.

22:52.503 --> 22:54.403
What happened to me
happened once.

22:56.040 --> 22:57.735
Pardon?

23:02.980 --> 23:06.416
Not 8,000 times a day.
One time.

23:08.152 --> 23:10.985
I understand what you're feeling.

23:16.761 --> 23:18.023
Excuse me.

23:19.897 --> 23:24.129
Okay, see? That's what happens
when we put up the barricades.

23:34.545 --> 23:36.445
Sorry.

23:41.352 --> 23:42.512
About what?

23:43.087 --> 23:45.282
About whatever brought you here.

23:47.859 --> 23:49.622
How did yours happen?

23:50.695 --> 23:52.788
Hit and run.

23:54.932 --> 23:56.729
Me too.

23:59.637 --> 24:01.366
Did they catch the person?

24:01.439 --> 24:03.100
No, they didn't.

24:07.645 --> 24:09.112
I have to be somewhere.

24:11.916 --> 24:13.406
Can I give you a ride?

24:13.484 --> 24:15.179
Somebody's meeting me.

24:15.253 --> 24:16.550
What about later?

24:17.555 --> 24:19.989
It's kind of a bad time.

24:20.057 --> 24:22.685
I didn't say
we'd enjoy ourselves.

24:23.761 --> 24:25.160
You promise?

24:25.229 --> 24:27.254
We'll be pitiful.

24:28.833 --> 24:32.291
I'll be back next week,
and if you're here, then we'll see.

24:37.341 --> 24:38.899
Wasn't an accident, Molly.

24:40.611 --> 24:42.511
He knew what he was doing.

24:42.580 --> 24:44.172
What are you talking about?

24:44.248 --> 24:48.014
He drives a 1972
Cadillac El Dorado, pepper green.

24:48.085 --> 24:49.950
I believe you know the car.

24:50.021 --> 24:51.613
If you know something
about what happened to me,

24:51.689 --> 24:53.384
take it to the police.

24:53.457 --> 24:54.515
They can't help us.

24:54.592 --> 24:57.254
You don't think
I've tried that before?

24:57.328 --> 24:58.625
No police.

24:58.696 --> 25:00.721
Did he take
something of yours?

25:00.798 --> 25:02.060
What do you mean?

25:02.133 --> 25:04.761
Are you missing something,
something to remember you by?

25:04.836 --> 25:07.100
He always takes a souvenir.

25:09.473 --> 25:10.906
He took my picture.

25:12.276 --> 25:14.608
If I can find you, so can he.

25:14.679 --> 25:16.738
He's coming back, Molly.

25:16.814 --> 25:18.975
You're his only mistake.

25:28.359 --> 25:30.020
11:00, Orchestra Hall.

26:31.455 --> 26:33.787
I think you and I
had better talk.

26:35.359 --> 26:39.227
Hey! Son of a bitch! Damn!

27:00.117 --> 27:02.483
This is traffic unit 48.

27:03.788 --> 27:05.847
I've got a pursuit,
could use some backup.

27:05.923 --> 27:07.686
<i>- Identify yourself</i>.
- Macklin.

27:07.758 --> 27:08.918
<i>Who?</i>

27:08.993 --> 27:11.052
Will Macklin,
Traffic Investigations.

27:11.128 --> 27:12.527
<i>Stand by</i>.

27:14.632 --> 27:15.621
Shit!

27:19.904 --> 27:21.462
Never mind.

27:37.655 --> 27:40.988
The tunnel's coming up.
Maybe we should go around.

27:42.994 --> 27:44.154
Let's go around.

27:46.998 --> 27:47.987
Thanks, Boone.

28:23.968 --> 28:25.060
Boone!

29:44.281 --> 29:45.270
Boone.

29:46.383 --> 29:48.851
Boone, can you move?

30:17.815 --> 30:20.340
Boone! Boone!

30:47.945 --> 30:49.276
No!

31:54.712 --> 31:56.339
No! Hold it!

32:13.097 --> 32:14.121
Come on!

32:15.266 --> 32:16.460
Grab my hand!

32:18.369 --> 32:20.064
Look at me! Look at me!

32:21.105 --> 32:22.834
- Now!
- No!

32:45.062 --> 32:46.586
<i>Cray</i>.

32:47.831 --> 32:49.162
<i>You want another shot at me?</i>

32:50.934 --> 32:52.595
<i>Have the girl out here</i>
<i>tomorrow night</i>.

32:54.772 --> 32:59.641
<i>It's simple</i>.
<i>I want her. You want me</i>.

32:59.777 --> 33:01.244
<i>Use her</i>.

33:07.651 --> 33:10.176
- We'll be here.
<i>- Very good</i>.

33:10.254 --> 33:12.950
<i>Another 100.000 miles of this</i>,
<i>and you'll be</i>

33:13.023 --> 33:14.854
just like me.

33:27.504 --> 33:31.668
Let me out.
I have to help my friend.

33:32.676 --> 33:34.610
Molly, your friend's dead,

33:34.678 --> 33:38.307
and like I said before, no police.

33:54.031 --> 33:55.293
Any sign of the girl?

33:56.367 --> 33:57.356
<i>Nada</i>.

33:57.434 --> 33:58.958
The guy in the Barracuda?

34:00.037 --> 34:03.905
Well, his plates were stolen
three weeks ago in Indiana, and...

34:03.974 --> 34:05.066
What?

34:06.143 --> 34:07.405
He's missing a door.

34:56.726 --> 34:57.716
Please.

35:14.077 --> 35:15.601
What do you want with me?

35:20.217 --> 35:22.617
You're not seriously considering
going back out there.

35:22.686 --> 35:24.779
I'm not considering.
We'll be there.

35:24.855 --> 35:26.447
No, we won't.

35:28.859 --> 35:31.225
I am not getting back in that car.

35:35.232 --> 35:36.665
What happened to you?

35:39.503 --> 35:41.562
He killed someone
close to you, didn't he?

35:43.574 --> 35:45.565
Who did he run down?

35:58.388 --> 35:59.719
Stop!

36:02.092 --> 36:03.616
Am I gonna die?

36:19.476 --> 36:20.465
My wife.

36:26.149 --> 36:27.844
He ran over my wife.

37:24.508 --> 37:26.476
He always takes a souvenir?

37:30.247 --> 37:32.909
He convinced them
it was an accident.

37:33.984 --> 37:36.817
That she was standing
in the road.

37:36.887 --> 37:41.017
That he ran
because I went after him.

38:19.630 --> 38:21.029
I did three years...

38:22.299 --> 38:25.029
...and he spent
the next 18 months in the hospital.

38:25.102 --> 38:27.366
They rebuilt him
from the ground up.

38:28.372 --> 38:30.067
Then one day
his bed was empty.

38:31.074 --> 38:34.202
Month later, I got the first
of I don't know how many letters.

38:35.812 --> 38:38.975
Press clippings of his accidents.

38:39.049 --> 38:42.177
From all over the map.
Totally random.

38:43.186 --> 38:44.585
Just like yours.

38:44.655 --> 38:45.986
Most of them recent.

38:47.824 --> 38:48.813
Most?

38:49.559 --> 38:52.187
He'd been doing this
for a while.

38:53.263 --> 38:56.892
Nine women.
Three before Olivia.

38:56.967 --> 38:59.265
Why didn't you tell the police?

38:59.336 --> 39:00.394
I did.

39:01.738 --> 39:03.899
But they're just
hit-and-runs to the police,

39:03.974 --> 39:06.602
and usually
a thousand miles apart.

39:07.678 --> 39:11.114
They don't have the imagination
to link them to one man.

39:13.183 --> 39:15.014
Did you mean to hit him?

39:15.085 --> 39:18.020
I didn't know much
about driving back then.

39:19.122 --> 39:22.216
You know,
it's basic obstacle avoidance.

39:22.292 --> 39:24.886
You're not supposed to look
at the thing that you're trying to avoid

39:24.961 --> 39:27.293
or you'll drive right into it.

39:29.433 --> 39:31.424
All I know is...

39:33.603 --> 39:35.400
...I was looking at him.

39:57.961 --> 39:59.861
That door
get over here yet?

39:59.930 --> 40:00.919
Door?

40:02.165 --> 40:05.498
Oh, yeah.
You mean the '68. Sure.

40:09.573 --> 40:10.733
Check this out.

40:14.745 --> 40:17.680
"For use in supervised
acceleration trials.

40:17.748 --> 40:20.012
Not intended for highway use."

40:20.083 --> 40:24.076
Barracuda, Super Stock 426,
heavy package.

40:24.154 --> 40:26.554
Only about 50, 60 ever shipped.

40:26.623 --> 40:29.421
The body's been acid-dipped,
for weight.

40:30.861 --> 40:31.850
Check this out.

40:36.266 --> 40:37.858
There's no sound deadener.

40:40.103 --> 40:41.661
It's not what you'd call
street legal.

40:41.738 --> 40:45.367
Put her on a drag strip,
she'll lay down some serious rubber.

40:46.343 --> 40:48.504
Man, I'd love to get my hands
on the rest of her.

40:49.579 --> 40:50.773
Yeah, so would I.

40:51.715 --> 40:53.774
Hmph, something else.

40:55.085 --> 40:56.609
Look at the tiny magnet
on that thing.

40:56.686 --> 40:58.620
It's not for voice only...

40:58.688 --> 41:01.748
scanner, two-way radio,
C.B., stuff like that.

41:03.193 --> 41:04.956
That mean something to you?

41:05.529 --> 41:06.928
Maybe.

41:06.997 --> 41:09.591
Someone I'm looking for
uses a C.B.

41:09.666 --> 41:12.032
Well, congratulations.

41:12.102 --> 41:13.626
You've arrested his door.

41:15.705 --> 41:18.003
Wally, can you
hook me up with a C.B.?

41:19.176 --> 41:21.167
Yeah, I got a nice little
40-channel number,

41:21.244 --> 41:23.542
single side band,
voice lock, dynamic squelch.

41:23.613 --> 41:25.638
How's that grab you?

41:25.715 --> 41:28.183
If that's a C.B., I'll take it.

41:43.433 --> 41:45.731
You've done this before.

41:45.802 --> 41:48.134
A long time ago.

41:49.206 --> 41:50.195
You're a doctor?

41:52.709 --> 41:54.040
It's just what I was.

41:59.716 --> 42:02.810
Here's a... shirt.

42:04.020 --> 42:05.612
And, uh...

42:07.490 --> 42:10.050
...some other things,
if you need 'em.

42:11.828 --> 42:13.056
Thank you.

42:25.842 --> 42:27.571
Could you turn around?

42:36.753 --> 42:38.687
So, what was he
before all of this?

42:39.923 --> 42:41.117
Insurance.

42:42.192 --> 42:44.092
He worked out of
a little bungalow in Oakland.

42:45.095 --> 42:47.689
Mostly automobile coverage.

42:47.764 --> 42:50.164
Dealing with smashups all day

42:50.233 --> 42:52.701
could be where he
picked up a taste for it.

42:54.537 --> 42:56.801
Definitely where he learned
how to get away with it.

42:59.709 --> 43:01.040
It happened to you, too.

43:03.246 --> 43:04.577
A car did that.

43:06.483 --> 43:07.814
When you were a kid.

43:13.323 --> 43:15.314
Who was driving,
your mom or your dad?

43:19.863 --> 43:21.524
Dad.

43:21.598 --> 43:22.997
Did he make it?

43:26.703 --> 43:28.637
What about your mom?

43:34.144 --> 43:36.704
I can't drive because of it.

43:39.916 --> 43:41.645
Can't get over the fear
that I'll screw up

43:41.718 --> 43:44.312
and make another little girl
an orphan.

43:44.387 --> 43:47.652
We have a lot in common,
you and me.

43:47.724 --> 43:50.716
I can't go out there again.

43:50.794 --> 43:53.661
He disappears for three,
four months at a time.

43:53.730 --> 43:55.960
I'd have to start over again.

43:56.032 --> 43:57.693
I can't do it.

43:58.768 --> 44:01.931
He'd be halfway across the country
right now if it weren't for you.

44:02.005 --> 44:04.439
Molly, he killed two of your friends

44:04.507 --> 44:06.202
without so much
as getting a speeding ticket.

44:06.276 --> 44:08.767
- I know what he did.
- Then help me.

44:10.313 --> 44:11.712
I can't.

44:15.151 --> 44:17.517
There's something
I can't do, either.

44:18.922 --> 44:20.412
I can't let you go.

44:58.461 --> 45:00.452
<i>- Will</i>.
- I'm here.

45:00.530 --> 45:03.931
<i>Okay. There are only 25</i>
<i>heavy Barracudas still registered</i>.

45:04.000 --> 45:05.797
<i>One model matching description</i>.

45:05.869 --> 45:08.394
<i>Owner of record</i>.
<i>Cray. Renford James</i>.

45:08.471 --> 45:10.564
<i>Did three years</i>
<i>for aggravated assault</i>.

45:12.442 --> 45:14.740
<i>Guess what he used</i>
<i>for a weapon</i>.

45:14.811 --> 45:16.472
His car.

45:36.132 --> 45:37.292
<i>Cray</i>.

45:39.069 --> 45:40.331
<i>Are you there?</i>

45:42.405 --> 45:46.000
<i>I was thinking of</i>
<i>heading out west after this one</i>.

45:46.076 --> 45:48.271
<i>Try our luck</i>
<i>on one of the super slabs</i>,

45:48.344 --> 45:52.110
<i>The I-10. maybe the 70</i>,
<i>past all those Pizza Huts</i>.

45:52.182 --> 45:56.346
<i>7-11s. K-Marts</i>,
<i>all those chain cities</i>.

45:57.821 --> 45:59.948
<i>And all those girls</i>.

46:01.591 --> 46:07.655
<i>You know, she takes</i>
<i>a pretty good picture, our Molly</i>.

46:07.730 --> 46:13.134
<i>I wonedr if she's thinking of me</i>
<i>as much as I'm thinking of her</i>.

46:14.204 --> 46:16.195
<i>You should let me</i>
<i>finish her, Cray</i>.

46:17.207 --> 46:18.936
<i>You know I'm going to</i>.

46:20.310 --> 46:23.177
<i>Sooner, later</i>...

46:24.247 --> 46:27.910
...<i>with you, without you</i>.

46:44.400 --> 46:46.994
You know what
the head shrinkers call this?

46:48.671 --> 46:50.400
Exposure therapy.

46:53.343 --> 46:54.435
I know.

46:59.849 --> 47:02.875
When the body's doing something
it doesn't want to do...

47:04.120 --> 47:05.587
...it tightens up.

47:05.655 --> 47:09.682
You lose feeling
in your hands, your legs.

47:09.759 --> 47:11.056
You can't steer.

47:12.128 --> 47:13.322
You can't shift.

47:16.332 --> 47:18.197
Turn the key.

48:29.839 --> 48:31.238
Is that him?

48:31.307 --> 48:34.640
No. His headlights
are like his eyes.

48:34.711 --> 48:36.611
Only one works.

48:40.984 --> 48:42.246
His body is his car.

48:43.253 --> 48:46.654
Stop his car, stop him.

48:49.192 --> 48:52.684
All we have to do is husk
the slug right out of his shell.

49:07.076 --> 49:08.065
What?

49:09.779 --> 49:11.110
I'm not sure.

49:23.459 --> 49:24.448
Listen.

49:41.744 --> 49:45.874
<i>Cray, do you have her?</i>
<i>Is she with you?</i>

49:47.550 --> 49:49.347
<i>Yeah, She's here</i>.

49:58.795 --> 50:00.490
He's coming.

50:47.810 --> 50:48.970
Shit!

50:49.045 --> 50:51.605
God damn!

52:29.479 --> 52:31.106
Rennie!

52:38.354 --> 52:39.912
Rennie!

53:32.174 --> 53:33.903
Renford James Cray!

53:37.046 --> 53:38.343
Kill the engine.

53:39.749 --> 53:42.980
Listen to me carefully, 'cause
I only have time to say this once.

53:43.052 --> 53:46.180
The fellow you're after
drives a '72 Cadillac El Dorado.

53:46.255 --> 53:47.950
He's got a two-minute head start.

53:48.024 --> 53:51.187
Step out of my way,
I make that time up no problem.

53:51.260 --> 53:53.785
- Turn it off.
- Three-minute head start.

53:53.863 --> 53:55.694
I said turn it off!

53:55.765 --> 53:57.960
The only way I'm gonna find out
what's going on is to keep...

53:58.034 --> 53:59.797
...one of you off the road...
- Move!

53:59.869 --> 54:01.336
...long enough to fill me in!

54:20.756 --> 54:22.553
<i>Cray, pick up</i>.

54:23.626 --> 54:25.059
<i>Pick up, Cray</i>.

54:26.128 --> 54:27.322
<i>I know you're there</i>.

54:31.667 --> 54:33.100
Is she still alive?

54:33.169 --> 54:35.262
<i>I'm not sure</i>.

54:35.338 --> 54:36.600
Just tell me!

54:36.672 --> 54:37.764
<i>Let me check</i>.

54:37.840 --> 54:40.866
<i>No! Rennie! No!</i>

54:40.943 --> 54:41.967
Fargo!

54:47.516 --> 54:48.505
Fargo.

54:48.584 --> 54:52.714
Would someone please tell me
what the fuck is going on?

54:53.789 --> 54:56.280
Yeah. First help me
find a radiator.

56:27.216 --> 56:29.912
Do you have any idea
where we're going,

56:29.985 --> 56:31.816
or you just driving?

56:31.887 --> 56:34.219
Been tracking him
for two years.

56:34.290 --> 56:37.487
Yeah, I have some idea.

56:40.496 --> 56:42.259
You're just driving.

56:48.170 --> 56:50.104
He prefers major highways.

56:50.172 --> 56:51.764
See, he likes to speed.

56:51.841 --> 56:54.275
With fall coming,
he'll stick pretty much

56:54.343 --> 56:56.607
to the western/southwestern
states.

56:56.679 --> 56:59.614
He has a sixth sense
for hick towns with speed traps

56:59.682 --> 57:01.650
and manages to avoid them.

57:01.717 --> 57:04.208
He loves tunnels,
drive-thru restaurants.

57:04.286 --> 57:05.719
He hates drawbridges,

57:05.788 --> 57:08.586
will go miles out of his way
to avoid one.

57:08.657 --> 57:10.090
Used to stop for repairs, too,

57:10.159 --> 57:13.060
but he's gotten pretty good
at taking care of that himself.

57:13.129 --> 57:16.064
You can patch a punctured lung
just as easily as a flat tire.

57:18.634 --> 57:20.158
Why does he do it?

57:20.236 --> 57:23.171
He just does it.
Isn't that enough?

57:23.239 --> 57:26.572
No, man. If I'm supposed
to help, I need to know more.

57:26.642 --> 57:29.611
His father had
a little auto insurance business.

57:30.813 --> 57:32.906
He used to show his kid
wreck photos.

57:33.983 --> 57:38.079
Bodies, smashed faces,
decapitations.

57:38.154 --> 57:41.590
Kid collected them, and he went
to work for his father.

57:41.657 --> 57:43.420
Soon that wasn't enough.

57:43.492 --> 57:47.553
He started creating his own pictures
with the accidents he caused.

57:47.630 --> 57:50.531
Why Molly? I mean,
how does he choose these women?

57:50.599 --> 57:52.260
It's completely random.

57:53.669 --> 57:56.638
He drives for hours, playing out
different scenarios in his head

57:56.705 --> 58:00.163
until he has to act, then he just
looks for an opportunity.

58:00.242 --> 58:02.073
You know, an empty highway or...

58:03.779 --> 58:05.269
...a woman by herself.

58:07.449 --> 58:10.213
So, a killer
who leaves no fingerprints,

58:10.286 --> 58:11.719
no DNA,

58:11.787 --> 58:14.221
and he drives off
in the murder weapon.

58:16.458 --> 58:18.392
And only you know about it.

58:19.962 --> 58:20.951
And you.

58:26.936 --> 58:30.064
Have you ever seen him?
Up close, I mean.

58:32.141 --> 58:33.130
Twice.

58:35.477 --> 58:36.774
Last night.

58:36.846 --> 58:38.643
Five years ago.

58:41.483 --> 58:42.916
The day he killed my wife.

58:45.821 --> 58:48.085
He looked exactly
like what he was...

58:48.157 --> 58:50.421
a middle-aged insurance salesman

58:50.492 --> 58:53.757
that no one
would pay attention to.

58:55.030 --> 58:56.395
Ordinary face.

58:57.399 --> 58:58.764
Forgettable.

59:00.169 --> 59:03.866
Except you can't forget it.

59:04.940 --> 59:06.532
Let me tell you something.

59:07.610 --> 59:09.601
Outside that Caddie,
he is nothing.

59:10.613 --> 59:12.444
You separate the mind
from the machine...

59:13.782 --> 59:14.771
And what?

59:17.620 --> 59:18.780
You can go home.

59:35.804 --> 59:37.066
What?

59:37.139 --> 59:40.040
Not sure. Something.

01:00:12.174 --> 01:00:13.607
It's morphine sulfate.

01:00:32.261 --> 01:00:33.694
She's alive.

01:00:33.762 --> 01:00:35.753
I don't understand.
How can you tell?

01:00:35.831 --> 01:00:38.095
That's what he's telling us.

01:00:45.140 --> 01:00:47.904
He's also telling us
where he's taken her.

01:00:48.477 --> 01:00:49.466
Where?

01:00:49.979 --> 01:00:52.140
About four hundred miles
or so...

01:00:53.716 --> 01:00:55.980
...across a couple of states.

01:00:57.553 --> 01:00:59.783
It's where
he's gonna kill her.

01:01:18.974 --> 01:01:20.771
You know where we are?

01:01:23.245 --> 01:01:26.180
I got it for a good price.

01:01:26.248 --> 01:01:28.614
Insurance money.

01:01:38.827 --> 01:01:40.590
You know what that is?

01:01:43.032 --> 01:01:45.193
There's a lot of me
still in that car.

01:01:47.369 --> 01:01:50.702
If you look close,
you can see bone.

01:02:03.318 --> 01:02:04.649
Check the glove box.

01:02:11.960 --> 01:02:13.325
Pictures.

01:02:25.874 --> 01:02:27.307
This your wife?

01:02:29.678 --> 01:02:30.872
Keep looking.

01:02:34.616 --> 01:02:36.481
There. That one.

01:02:39.521 --> 01:02:41.853
It was taken
the day he killed her.

01:02:43.592 --> 01:02:45.958
For revenge,
he's gonna do it again.

01:04:07.409 --> 01:04:10.469
There's one thing about me
Fargo's always depended on.

01:04:10.546 --> 01:04:11.740
What's that?

01:04:13.315 --> 01:04:14.475
I'd come alone.

01:04:16.151 --> 01:04:17.709
He'll be expecting me.

01:04:17.786 --> 01:04:20.118
Won't be expecting you.

01:04:27.663 --> 01:04:30.427
Is there a REACT unit
monitoring this channel?

01:04:33.068 --> 01:04:35.332
This is a police emergency.

01:04:36.738 --> 01:04:40.174
I'm at a motel
somewhere near the state line.

01:04:43.011 --> 01:04:44.069
Towers Motel.

01:04:46.081 --> 01:04:48.345
Anyone. Anyo...

01:05:08.971 --> 01:05:10.768
I need to be sure of something.

01:05:12.241 --> 01:05:14.402
You've been on this highway
a long time,

01:05:14.476 --> 01:05:16.307
and that can change a man.

01:05:18.213 --> 01:05:21.512
I need to be sure that when the
time comes, you can change back.

01:05:23.585 --> 01:05:25.416
What are you asking?

01:05:30.993 --> 01:05:33.985
We're here to save a life,
not commit homicide.

01:05:35.330 --> 01:05:36.695
Right?

01:07:17.866 --> 01:07:20.164
Right there is good, Cray!

01:07:20.235 --> 01:07:22.669
- Rennie!
- I said there!

01:08:08.183 --> 01:08:10.014
Go. Go.

01:15:54.015 --> 01:15:57.576
Who are you supposed to be?

01:15:58.653 --> 01:16:00.314
Will Macklin.

01:16:01.723 --> 01:16:04.123
State traffic investigator.

01:16:05.305 --> 01:16:11.787
