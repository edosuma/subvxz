WEBVTT

00:01.567 --> 00:03.667
- I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU MAKE ME
READ 'EM BEDTIME STORIES.

00:03.667 --> 00:07.700
ALL I HEAR IS,
"MOMMY READS BETTER."

00:07.700 --> 00:10.033
"SPORTS ILLUSTRATED
ISN'T A BOOK."

00:14.367 --> 00:15.667
- I HAVE A THOUGHT.

00:15.667 --> 00:18.500
- HEY, HEY,
DON'T GET OVERHEATED.

00:20.633 --> 00:23.533
- MIGHT I SUGGEST
THAT PERHAPS THE REASON

00:23.533 --> 00:25.667
FOR RAYMOND'S
UNWILLINGNESS TO SHARE

00:25.667 --> 00:27.833
WITH THE PARENTAL
RESPONSIBILITIES

00:27.833 --> 00:29.800
IS A FEAR OF INTIMACY,

00:29.800 --> 00:31.500
BROUGHT ON BY HIS DISTANT

00:31.500 --> 00:33.933
AND SOMEWHAT STRAINED
RELATIONSHIP

00:33.933 --> 00:36.333
WITH HIS FATHER?

00:38.800 --> 00:43.767
- ROBERT'S BEEN SEEING
DR. GREENBERG EVERY TUESDAY.

00:43.767 --> 00:45.533
- WHAT, YOUR THERAPIST?

00:45.533 --> 00:49.500
- OH, THAT'S WONDERFUL, ROBBIE.

00:49.500 --> 00:53.567
- HOW DOES HE DO IT,
PUSH TWO COUCHES TOGETHER?

00:56.667 --> 01:00.633
- YOU SEE, JOKING IS NOTHING
MORE THAN A DEFENSE MECHANISM.

01:00.633 --> 01:04.600
IT MASKS SOME REAL PROBLEMS
THAT CERTAIN MEN HAVE

01:04.600 --> 01:05.600
BECAUSE THEY ARE AFRAID

01:05.600 --> 01:07.967
TO GET IN TOUCH
WITH THEIR FEELINGS.

01:07.967 --> 01:13.700
- HEY, DAD, I'M GIVIN' ROBERT
THE FINGER IN MY MIND.

01:19.000 --> 01:23.667
WANT ME TO PUT ONE UP
FOR YOU?

01:23.667 --> 01:26.267
- NO, I GOT IT.

01:31.900 --> 01:35.133
- BOTH OF YOU, PUT THOSE DOWN.

01:36.767 --> 01:37.800
- THAT'S OKAY, MA.

01:37.800 --> 01:39.867
THIS IS MEN IN A NUTSHELL.

01:39.867 --> 01:42.967
- I WISH YOU WOULD TAKE RAY
TO DR. GREENBERG SOMETIME.

01:42.967 --> 01:44.967
- LOOK, DON'T THINK
I WOULDN'T LOVE TO.

01:44.967 --> 01:46.667
YOU KNOW,
MOST OF MY PROBLEMS STEM

01:46.667 --> 01:49.167
FROM MY COMBATIVE
MALE RELATIONSHIPS IN THE HOME.

01:49.167 --> 01:52.167
- SHUT UP.

01:52.167 --> 01:54.533
- GOD FORBID YOU SHOULD IMPROVE
AS A HUMAN BEING.

01:54.533 --> 01:56.300
FIX YOUR RELATIONSHIP
WITH YOUR BROTHER.

01:56.300 --> 01:58.333
- MY RELATIONSHIP
WITH HIM IS FINE.

01:58.333 --> 02:00.100
WHAT ARE YOU BRINGING
THIS PSYCHO-CRAPOLA

02:00.100 --> 02:01.333
INTO MY HOUSE FOR?

02:01.333 --> 02:02.700
- IT'S NOT CRAPOLA!

02:02.700 --> 02:04.600
YOU'RE JUST AFRAID
TO LOOK AT YOURSELF.

02:04.600 --> 02:06.900
- NO, I'M AFRAID TO LOOK AT YOU,
'CAUSE YOU'RE UGLY.

02:06.900 --> 02:08.200
- YOU'RE THE UGLY ONE.

02:08.200 --> 02:09.800
YOU'RE UGLY ON THE INSIDE.

02:09.800 --> 02:11.100
- WELL, THEN GO OUTSIDE!

02:11.100 --> 02:12.633
- YOU GO OUTSIDE!
- IT'S MY HOUSE!

02:12.633 --> 02:14.200
OH, I FORGOT,
YOU DON'T HAVE A HOUSE,

02:14.200 --> 02:16.000
'CAUSE YOU STILL
DON'T HAVE A LIFE!

02:19.867 --> 02:23.100
WHAT? WHAT?

02:23.100 --> 02:26.967
OH...LISTEN,
I DIDN'T MEAN IT.

02:26.967 --> 02:28.800
COME ON.

02:28.800 --> 02:30.200
COME ON.

02:38.400 --> 02:41.200
LOOK...

02:41.200 --> 02:43.733
ALL RIGHT,
ALL RIGHT.

02:43.733 --> 02:46.367
MAYBE...

02:46.367 --> 02:48.100
I'LL GO WITH YOU TOMORROW.

02:48.100 --> 02:49.700
- YES!

02:51.467 --> 02:54.267
- I CAN'T WAIT
TO HEAR HOW IT GOES.

02:54.267 --> 02:56.233
- ME TOO.
TELL ME ALL ABOUT IT.

02:56.233 --> 02:58.133
- OH, YOU'RE GOING TOO, FRANK.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.433
- NO, SIR.

03:01.433 --> 03:02.633
- OH, YES.

03:02.633 --> 03:06.233
OR I WILL FINALLY
BE CALLING COUSIN BELLA.

03:06.233 --> 03:08.800
- DON'T YOU THREATEN ME.

03:08.800 --> 03:10.267
- WHO'S COUSIN BELLA?

03:10.267 --> 03:13.300
- MY COUSIN BELLA HAPPENS TO BE
A TOP PSYCHIATRIST.

03:13.300 --> 03:15.533
- SHE'S A HIDEOUS MONSTER.

03:15.533 --> 03:18.533
- FOR YEARS, SHE'S OFFERED
TO COME UP FROM SOUTH CAROLINA

03:18.533 --> 03:22.133
TO STAY WITH US FOR SOME
EMERGENCY MARRIAGE COUNSELING.

03:22.133 --> 03:23.400
I'M GONNA CALL HER
RIGHT NOW.

03:23.400 --> 03:24.900
- PUT DOWN THAT PHONE.

03:24.900 --> 03:26.300
- SHE'S GONNA STAY WITH US

03:26.300 --> 03:31.067
AS LONG AS IT TAKES
TO MAKE YOU A PERSON.

03:31.067 --> 03:33.300
- ALL RIGHT!

03:33.300 --> 03:35.467
I'LL GO WITH THEM
TO THE THING.

03:35.467 --> 03:39.267
- HE'S GONNA HAVE THERAPY!

03:40.600 --> 03:41.833
- DAD!

03:41.833 --> 03:43.967
- OH, MY GOSH,
HE'S GOING TO THERAPY!

03:43.967 --> 03:45.900
- I CAN'T BELIEVE IT!

03:45.900 --> 03:47.100
- WONDERFUL DAY!

03:47.100 --> 03:48.500
OH, AND, FRANK,
DON'T BE AFRAID

03:48.500 --> 03:51.233
TO LET THEM KEEP YOU
FOR OBSERVATION.

03:57.867 --> 03:59.733
- OH, THIS IS SO GREAT.

04:07.500 --> 04:08.867
- ALL RIGHT, GUYS,
LOOK. LISTEN.

04:08.867 --> 04:10.333
THERE'S A COUPLE THINGS
I WANT TO GO OVER

04:10.333 --> 04:11.933
BEFORE WE GO INSIDE, ALL RIGHT?

04:11.933 --> 04:14.233
NOW, I DON'T WANT THIS
TO THROW YOU OFF,

04:14.233 --> 04:17.800
BUT DR. GREENBERG
HAS A BIT OF A LAZY EYE.

04:17.800 --> 04:19.933
OKAY?

04:19.933 --> 04:24.267
SO WHEN HE LOOKS AT YOU,
HE MAY NOT BE LOOKING AT YOU.

04:24.267 --> 04:25.867
HE MAY BE LOOKING AT YOU.

04:25.867 --> 04:28.733
SO DO YOU GUYS KNOW WHAT
YOU WANT TO START WITH TODAY?

04:28.733 --> 04:31.433
- HOW MUCH I HATE YOU.

04:31.433 --> 04:32.867
- ACTUALLY, THAT'S VERY GOOD.

04:32.867 --> 04:34.100
DON'T HOLD BACK, RAYMOND, OKAY?

04:34.100 --> 04:35.533
THERE'S NOTHING TO BE AFRAID OF.

04:35.533 --> 04:37.833
- YEAH, I ACTUALLY
HAVE SOMETHING

04:37.833 --> 04:39.300
I NEED TO GET OFF MY CHEST.

04:39.300 --> 04:40.467
- WHAT IS IT, DAD?

04:40.467 --> 04:42.900
- I'M NOT GOING IN THERE.

04:42.900 --> 04:44.167
- WHAT?

04:44.167 --> 04:45.300
- I'M NOT GOING IN THERE.

04:45.300 --> 04:46.633
AND I WOULD NEVER SET FOOT

04:46.633 --> 04:48.467
IN SOME VOODOO MAN'S
SUCKER TRAP,

04:48.467 --> 04:50.700
NOT FOR ALL THE TEA IN CHINA

04:50.700 --> 04:53.067
NOR FOR ALL
THE CHINESE WAITRESSES

04:53.067 --> 04:56.967
WHO BRING THE TEA.

04:56.967 --> 04:59.933
THERE. I FEEL BETTER.

04:59.933 --> 05:02.067
- DAD, COME ON.
WE HAD A DEAL.

05:02.067 --> 05:03.333
- HEY, LOOK,
IF HE'S NOT GOING,

05:03.333 --> 05:04.967
THEN I'M NOT GOING,
ALL RIGHT?

05:04.967 --> 05:06.000
DAD, LET'S JUST GET A SLICE.

05:06.000 --> 05:07.300
- NOW YOU'RE TALKING.

05:07.300 --> 05:08.767
- LISTEN, LISTEN.
HEY, HEY. COME ON.

05:08.767 --> 05:10.833
I'M PAYING AN EXTRA $100
FOR THIS SESSION,

05:10.833 --> 05:12.533
AND IT'S TWO HOURS, YOU SEE,

05:12.533 --> 05:15.700
SO YOU CAN'T GO HOME,
BECAUSE THE GIRLS WILL KNOW.

05:15.700 --> 05:17.967
- DID YOU PAY HIM
THE EXTRA MONEY YET?

05:17.967 --> 05:19.400
- NO, I'M GONNA PAY HIM
RIGHT NOW.

05:19.400 --> 05:22.367
- YOU'VE GOT
100 EXTRA BUCKS...

05:22.367 --> 05:25.467
AND WE'VE GOT
TWO FREE HOURS.

05:34.667 --> 05:38.167
- WHOO-HOO, YEAH.

05:38.167 --> 05:41.733
OH, YEAH.

05:41.733 --> 05:44.467
- THIS IS NOT
WHAT I HAD IN MIND.

05:44.467 --> 05:46.000
- OH, NO? WE'RE UP 500 BUCKS.

05:46.000 --> 05:50.567
MAYBE YOU SHOULD START
HAVING THAT IN MIND, PHONE POLE.

05:50.567 --> 05:53.267
- YEAH, PHONE POLE,
'CAUSE YOU'RE BIG!

05:53.267 --> 05:54.600
- ALL RIGHT. THAT'S ENOUGH.

05:54.600 --> 05:56.200
NOT ONLY DID YOU TWO
LIE TO THE GIRLS,

05:56.200 --> 05:57.800
BUT YOU MADE ME LIE
TO THE DOCTOR.

05:57.800 --> 05:59.367
NOW IT'S GONNA
BE HARDER THAN EVER

05:59.367 --> 06:02.367
TO LOOK DR. GREENBERG
IN THE EYE.

06:04.800 --> 06:06.833
- OH, MY GOD, LOOK AT THIS.

06:06.833 --> 06:08.533
WE GOT TO BET THIS HORSE.

06:08.533 --> 06:10.800
THIS IS A BIG HORSE,
A SURE THING.

06:10.800 --> 06:13.400
THIS HORSE IS UNSTOPPABLE!

06:13.400 --> 06:16.133
- "MARIE'S MOUTH."

06:23.767 --> 06:27.867
- THIS IS A SIGN FROM GOD.

06:27.867 --> 06:29.900
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE HERE.

06:29.900 --> 06:30.933
I'M IN!

06:30.933 --> 06:32.133
- I'M WAY IN.

06:32.133 --> 06:34.900
CARE FOR A PIECE, ROBERT?

06:34.900 --> 06:38.533
- IT IS A GOOD SIGN.

06:59.667 --> 07:04.167
- SO...HOW WAS THERAPY?

07:04.167 --> 07:07.500
- I GOT TO TELL YOU...

07:07.500 --> 07:12.133
IT WAS KIND OF
A FULFILLING EXPERIENCE.

07:13.100 --> 07:14.500
- YEAH?

07:14.500 --> 07:16.233
- YEAH.

07:16.233 --> 07:19.267
- OH, ISN'T THIS WONDERFUL?

07:19.267 --> 07:20.800
WHAT DID YOU THINK, FRANK?

07:20.800 --> 07:24.300
- WELL, WHEN YOU WERE
YAKKIN' ME INTO THIS,

07:24.300 --> 07:28.733
I WAS, AS YOU KNOW,
VERY SKEPTICAL.

07:28.733 --> 07:31.600
BUT THEN I GOT THERE,
AND I HAVE TO SAY...

07:31.600 --> 07:34.700
IT REALLY PAID OFF.

07:40.133 --> 07:43.533
AND I OWE IT ALL
TO MARIE'S MOUTH.

07:47.800 --> 07:50.433
- I'M SO HAPPY I HELPED.

07:50.433 --> 07:51.733
- TO MARIE'S MOUTH!

07:54.667 --> 07:57.000
- OH, THIS IS SO GREAT!

07:57.000 --> 08:00.233
- YOU MEAN THIS GUY GOT THROUGH
TO YOU GUYS A LITTLE?

08:00.233 --> 08:02.300
- I GOT TO TELL YOU,
THAT DR. GREENBERG...

08:02.300 --> 08:03.833
HE'S A GENIUS.

08:03.833 --> 08:07.900
- KNOW WHAT?
I AM REALLY PROUD OF YOU GUYS.

08:07.900 --> 08:09.733
SO WHAT ELSE DID
DR. GREENBERG SAY?

08:09.733 --> 08:13.933
- WELL...HE SAID THAT I'VE
ACTUALLY BEEN IN DENIAL

08:13.933 --> 08:16.133
WITH MY FEELINGS
TOWARDS ROBERT.

08:16.133 --> 08:17.267
YEAH.

08:17.267 --> 08:20.033
I THINK I LOVE HIM NOW.

08:25.767 --> 08:27.867
- THIS IS SO SWEET.

08:27.867 --> 08:29.433
- AND WE REALIZE
HOW LUCKY WE ARE

08:29.433 --> 08:31.800
TO HAVE YOU GUYS AT HOME TOO.

08:31.800 --> 08:35.567
YOU KNOW, DR. GREENBERG SAID
THAT OUR MARITAL COMPANIONS

08:35.567 --> 08:38.367
CAN HELP OUR SITUATION
EVEN FURTHER.

08:38.367 --> 08:41.433
- OH, FINE WITH ME.
HOW?

08:41.433 --> 08:44.100
- WELL...

08:44.100 --> 08:46.800
WE ALL HAVE...YOU KNOW...

08:46.800 --> 08:48.433
TENSION.

08:48.433 --> 08:54.067
AND WHATEVER YOU CAN DO
TO ALLEVIATE...

08:54.067 --> 08:56.667
YOU KNOW...

08:56.667 --> 08:59.967
DR. GREENBERG SAID.

08:59.967 --> 09:01.433
- I AM HAPPY TO HELP.

09:05.833 --> 09:10.167
- OH, FRANK, I CAN'T WAIT
TO TALK MORE ABOUT THIS.

09:10.167 --> 09:12.800
I ALWAYS SAY,
NOTHING IS MORE IMPORTANT

09:12.800 --> 09:14.333
THAN DISCUSSING ONE'S FEELINGS.

09:14.333 --> 09:19.167
AND NOW WE CAN HAVE
REAL DISCUSSIONS.

09:22.767 --> 09:24.200
- YEAH.

09:24.200 --> 09:25.633
ABOUT THAT...

09:25.633 --> 09:30.733
DR. GREENBERG ADVISED ME
TO HAVE A CONE OF SILENCE.

09:35.167 --> 09:38.000
- A CONE OF SILENCE?

09:38.000 --> 09:42.933
- YES, I NEED
A CONE OF SILENCE...

09:42.933 --> 09:46.967
AROUND ME WHENEVER I FEEL
"BAD FRANK" COMING ON.

09:46.967 --> 09:49.600
HE SUGGESTED
A 10-FOOT RADIUS.

10:07.033 --> 10:08.767
A LITTLE MORE.

10:12.800 --> 10:15.667
THAT'S GOOD, HONEY.

10:15.667 --> 10:17.200
- OH, CHI-CHI.

10:17.200 --> 10:22.767
I'LL DO ANYTHING, IF IT MEANS
YOU'RE MENTALLY BALANCED.

10:22.767 --> 10:27.633
- THE BALANCE FEELS GOOD NOW.

10:38.000 --> 10:39.833
- HELLO, LADIES.

10:39.833 --> 10:41.700
- HEY.

10:41.700 --> 10:43.167
HOW WE DOING?

10:43.167 --> 10:48.200
- WE ARE UP LIKE A WEDGIE
ON THE FAT KID AT CAMP.

10:48.200 --> 10:50.467
- HOW MUCH?

10:50.467 --> 10:52.900
- WELL, MY PAPA,
AFTER FIVE WEEKS,

10:52.900 --> 10:56.300
WE HAVE CLEARED
1,400 SEMOLEANS.

10:56.300 --> 10:58.167
- HERE'S TO PSYCHOTHERAPY.

11:01.300 --> 11:04.300
- WHAT EXCUSE DID YOU GIVE
DR. GREENBERG THIS WEEK?

11:04.300 --> 11:05.967
- OH, I DIDN'T EVEN
TALK TO HIM THIS WEEK.

11:05.967 --> 11:08.433
I TOLD HIM I WAS GONNA BE
WORKIN' UNDERCOVER FOR A WHILE,

11:08.433 --> 11:10.300
AND WHEN I CAME BACK,
I'D HAVE PLENTY OF ISSUES.

11:10.300 --> 11:11.633
- WHAT KIND OF ISSUES?

11:11.633 --> 11:13.467
- I TOLD HIM
I HAVE TO DRESS AS A WOMAN,

11:13.467 --> 11:16.400
AND I HAD TO BORROW THE OUTFIT
FROM MY MOTHER.

11:16.400 --> 11:19.200
- HA!
OH, YEAH.

11:19.200 --> 11:21.300
OH, THAT'S PERFECT.
- I KNOW.

11:21.300 --> 11:24.000
- IF HE ONLY KNEW WHAT
A SICK BASTARD YOU REALLY ARE.

11:24.000 --> 11:26.800
- I KNOW!

11:26.800 --> 11:30.667
- ALL RIGHT, SO WHAT'S GONNA BE
OUR BREAKTHROUGH FOR TODAY?

11:30.667 --> 11:31.600
- OKAY, LET'S SEE.

11:31.600 --> 11:33.600
THE LAST THING
I TOLD THE WIVES

11:33.600 --> 11:36.800
IS THAT WE WERE WORKING ON
DAD'S WITHHOLDING OF AFFECTION

11:36.800 --> 11:37.800
WHEN WE WERE KIDS.

11:37.800 --> 11:39.267
- GOOD, GOOD.

11:39.267 --> 11:41.167
- AND HOW IT IMPACTED
NEGATIVELY ON US.

11:41.167 --> 11:43.600
FOR INSTANCE,
WHENEVER I DID SOMETHING,

11:43.600 --> 11:46.300
I ALWAYS FELT THAT DAD
WAS DISAPPOINTED IN ME,

11:46.300 --> 11:49.800
NOT TO MENTION
THE NEGLECT AND VERBAL ABUSE.

11:49.800 --> 11:51.567
- OKAY.

11:51.567 --> 11:53.767
SO WHAT CAN WE SAY
AS TO WHY YOU WERE LIKE THAT--

11:53.767 --> 11:57.500
YOU KNOW, UNRECEPTIVE
TO OUR NEEDS AND STUFF?

11:57.500 --> 11:59.133
- RIGHT, RIGHT.

11:59.133 --> 12:01.033
WHY WAS I LIKE THAT?

12:01.033 --> 12:05.367
'CAUSE YOU TWO WERE
A COUPLE OF MONKEY'S ASSES.

12:06.800 --> 12:08.767
- OKAY.

12:10.200 --> 12:11.900
I THINK THAT MIGHT BE
THE VERBAL ABUSE

12:11.900 --> 12:15.133
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT,
ROBERT.

12:15.133 --> 12:16.800
- NO.

12:16.800 --> 12:19.233
YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN THINKING
ABOUT THIS SINCE LAST WEEK.

12:19.233 --> 12:21.433
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU TWO'S
PROBLEMS WERE?

12:21.433 --> 12:24.267
YOU TOOK ALL THAT ABUSE STUFF
PERSONALLY.

12:24.267 --> 12:25.800
- OF COURSE WE TOOK IT
PERSONALLY.

12:25.800 --> 12:29.267
YOU'RE OUR FATHER!

12:32.300 --> 12:34.600
- IT WAS JUST BUSINESS.

12:34.600 --> 12:36.667
- THIS ISN'T EXACTLY
WHAT THEY CALL

12:36.667 --> 12:37.967
A TRIUMPH OF ANALYSIS.

12:37.967 --> 12:39.300
WHAT ELSE YOU GOT?

12:39.300 --> 12:42.000
- WHAT ELSE YOU GOT?

12:42.000 --> 12:44.200
- HOW ABOUT, UH...

12:44.200 --> 12:46.833
YOU WERE WITHDRAWN FROM
YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH US

12:46.833 --> 12:51.867
BECAUSE YOUR FATHER
WAS LIKE THAT WITH YOU?

12:51.867 --> 12:54.033
- THAT'S FRIGGIN' GREAT.

12:56.333 --> 12:59.100
- YEAH. VERY GOOD, RAYMOND.

12:59.100 --> 13:00.600
- YEAH, YEAH, 'CAUSE IT'S LIKE

13:00.600 --> 13:02.333
WHAT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT
THE OTHER DAY.

13:02.333 --> 13:04.233
I'M KIND OF A LOUSY DAD
BECAUSE OF HIM,

13:04.233 --> 13:07.733
SO I JUST BACK IT UP
ONE MORE TO GRANDPA JOE.

13:09.633 --> 13:12.833
- YEAH, YEAH,
AND HIS DAD WAS THE WORST,

13:12.833 --> 13:14.633
MY GRANDPA SAL.

13:14.633 --> 13:15.867
- OH, YEAH?

13:15.867 --> 13:17.167
- OH, YEAH, GRANDPA SAL?

13:17.167 --> 13:18.567
VERY SCARY.

13:18.567 --> 13:22.300
HE ONCE MADE MUSSOLINI
WET HIMSELF.

13:25.433 --> 13:27.267
MY DAD USED TO TELL ME
HORRIBLE STORIES

13:27.267 --> 13:29.133
ABOUT HOW HIS FATHER
USED TO HIT HIM...

13:29.133 --> 13:32.267
WHEN HE WASN'T HITTING ME.

13:32.267 --> 13:35.033
- GRANDPA JOE HIT YOU?

13:35.033 --> 13:37.433
- SURE, I GOT HIT EVERY DAY.

13:39.567 --> 13:41.867
- WOW, DAD.

13:41.867 --> 13:44.233
I DIDN'T KNOW
THAT IT WAS LIKE THAT FOR YOU.

13:44.233 --> 13:45.900
- IT WAS LIKE THAT
FOR EVERYBODY.

13:45.900 --> 13:48.100
THAT'S JUST THE WAY IT WAS.

13:49.433 --> 13:54.833
- SO YOUR DAD'S DAD HIT HIM,
HE HIT YOU,

13:54.833 --> 13:59.200
AND YOU NEVER REALLY HIT US.

13:59.200 --> 14:01.067
- I COULDN'T.

14:01.067 --> 14:03.233
I DON'T KNOW.

14:03.233 --> 14:05.500
I WAS ALWAYS
WEAKER THAN HIM.

14:09.533 --> 14:13.067
- MAYBE YOU DIDN'T
WANT TO BE LIKE HIM.

14:13.067 --> 14:19.067
- I DIDN'T.

14:26.900 --> 14:28.800
- THE GIRLS WILL BUY THAT.

14:28.800 --> 14:31.200
- OH, YEAH.
- YEAH.

14:31.200 --> 14:34.300
- THEY'LL EAT IT UP
LIKE A BAG OF CANDY.

14:34.300 --> 14:36.333
- COME ON,
LET'S BET THE NEXT RACE.

14:36.333 --> 14:38.000
I'M TREATING.

14:38.000 --> 14:39.900
- HEY, DAD,
CAN WE GET ICE CREAM?

14:39.900 --> 14:41.367
- SURE.

14:45.167 --> 14:46.633
- IS IT 6:00 YET?

14:46.633 --> 14:49.700
- ALMOST; THE BOYS SHOULD BE
HOME FROM THERAPY SOON.

14:49.700 --> 14:52.633
- ISN'T IT WONDERFUL?

14:52.633 --> 14:54.467
FRANK'S A NEW MAN.

14:54.467 --> 14:56.600
IT'S LIKE I'M CHEATING.

15:00.333 --> 15:01.833
- DID YOU SEE THIS?

15:01.833 --> 15:03.300
- WHAT?
- WHAT IS IT, DEAR?

15:03.300 --> 15:05.033
- IT'S DR. GREENBERG.

15:05.033 --> 15:07.300
- OBITUARIES?
HE DIED?

15:07.300 --> 15:13.667
- OH, MY GOD,
THAT'S AWFUL.

15:13.667 --> 15:15.000
- I KNOW.

15:15.000 --> 15:18.600
HE HAD A HEART ATTACK
LAST WEEK.

15:18.600 --> 15:21.900
HE WAS SUCH A SWEET MAN.

15:21.900 --> 15:23.900
- OH, HIS POOR FAMILY.

15:23.900 --> 15:25.800
THIS IS TERRIBLE.

15:25.800 --> 15:27.233
- WAIT A MINUTE.

15:27.233 --> 15:31.133
HE DIED LAST WEEK?

15:31.133 --> 15:32.367
- WELL, IT'S SUBCONSCIOUS,

15:32.367 --> 15:34.300
WHICH IS WHY
WE HAVE TO KEEP GOING.

15:37.867 --> 15:40.100
- HELLO, BEAUTIES.

15:41.800 --> 15:43.167
- SOMETHING SMELLS GOOD,

15:43.167 --> 15:45.333
AND I'M NOT
TALKING ABOUT DINNER.

15:47.100 --> 15:48.433
- HEY, THERE, BABY DOLL.

15:48.433 --> 15:51.467
HOW ABOUT GIVIN' DADDY
A LITTLE SUGAR?

15:55.800 --> 15:57.300
- GOOD SESSION TODAY?

15:57.300 --> 15:59.300
- OH, GREAT, GREAT,
SOME MAJOR BREAKTHROUGHS.

15:59.300 --> 16:00.500
- BETTER THAN MAJOR. GENERAL.

16:00.500 --> 16:03.200
FOUR-STAR GENERAL BREAKTHROUGHS.

16:03.200 --> 16:05.200
- I GOT TO BE HONEST.
I FEEL REALLY GREAT.

16:05.200 --> 16:09.367
SINCE I'VE BEEN IN ANALYSIS,
MY WHOLE OUTLOOK IS DIFFERENT.

16:09.367 --> 16:12.200
THAT DR. GREENBERG
WAS SENT FROM HEAVEN.

16:17.867 --> 16:19.700
- HEY, LOOK AT THIS.

16:19.700 --> 16:21.067
- WHAT HAVE YOU GOT?

16:27.733 --> 16:31.100
I THOUGHT HE LOOKED
A LITTLE PALE WHEN WE LEFT.

16:36.800 --> 16:38.400
- WHAT IS IT?

16:42.300 --> 16:44.667
OH, MY GOD,
WAS HE HIT BY A CAR?

16:44.667 --> 16:47.033
HE'S GOT THAT LAZY EYE.

16:47.033 --> 16:50.233
- IT WAS A HEART ATTACK,
ROBERT!

16:50.233 --> 16:52.367
HE DIED LAST WEEK.

16:52.367 --> 16:53.700
- OH.

16:57.800 --> 16:59.200
OHH!

17:00.400 --> 17:02.067
- WHAT IS IT?
GIVE ME THAT.

17:07.133 --> 17:09.467
GOOD NIGHT.

17:09.467 --> 17:11.933
- WHERE DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE GOING, FRANK?

17:11.933 --> 17:13.400
- THE NEWS IS DEPRESSING.

17:13.400 --> 17:15.167
I'M GOING TO LIE DOWN.

17:15.167 --> 17:18.000
- FRANK, YOU'D BETTER TAKE
A GOOD LOOK AT THIS SECTION,

17:18.000 --> 17:21.300
'CAUSE YOU'RE GONNA
BE IN THERE TOMORROW.

17:23.867 --> 17:26.167
- WELL, MAYBE NOT TOMORROW.

17:26.167 --> 17:28.033
LOOKS LIKE
IT TAKES A WEEK.

17:29.933 --> 17:31.833
- I DEMAND AN EXPLANATION.

17:31.833 --> 17:33.067
- YOU LIED TO US.

17:33.067 --> 17:34.400
- WHERE EXACTLY
HAVE YOU BEEN GOING?

17:34.400 --> 17:37.200
- ALL RIGHT, IF YOU MUST KNOW...
WE GO TO CHURCH.

17:37.200 --> 17:39.300
- OH, BULL!

17:39.300 --> 17:43.033
- TO LIE ABOUT CHURCH IS
A DOUBLE SIN!

17:43.033 --> 17:45.767
- THIS IS A TERRIBLE THING
YOU DID.

17:45.767 --> 17:47.433
- WHAT DID WE DO?

17:47.433 --> 17:49.800
YOU TRICKED US INTO THINKING
YOU WEREN'T PIGS ANYMORE,

17:49.800 --> 17:51.167
BUT YOU ARE WORSE THAN PIGS.

17:51.167 --> 17:53.733
YOU'RE TALKING PIGS WHO LIE!

17:55.500 --> 17:57.767
- WHY WOULD YOU DO THIS TO US?

17:57.767 --> 18:02.767
HERE WE WERE, SO HAPPY THAT YOU
GUYS WERE FINALLY CONNECTING.

18:02.767 --> 18:06.267
WE PICTURED YOU SITTING
IN DR. GREENBERG'S OFFICE

18:06.267 --> 18:09.800
AND GOING THROUGH ALL OF YOUR
AWFUL FIGHTS AND TRAUMAS

18:09.800 --> 18:12.433
AND CRYING, AND IT WAS SO CUTE.

18:15.100 --> 18:16.833
- WHERE DID YOU GO, FRANK?

18:16.833 --> 18:18.300
- I'M NOT TALKING.

18:18.300 --> 18:21.267
THERE IS SUCH A THING AS
PATIENT-DOCTOR CONFIDENTIALITY.

18:24.533 --> 18:26.033
- ROBBIE?

18:26.033 --> 18:28.400
- TO THE TRACK.

18:28.400 --> 18:30.500
- OH, WHAT?
- YOU'RE GAMBLING?

18:30.500 --> 18:32.467
- WHAT ARE YOU,
AN IMBECILE?

18:34.600 --> 18:36.100
- HOW DARE YOU!

18:36.100 --> 18:38.167
I'M MARRIED TO
A MENTALLY DISEASED,

18:38.167 --> 18:39.767
GAMBLING PSYCHOPATH.

18:41.733 --> 18:43.100
- OH, YEAH?

18:43.100 --> 18:45.033
I WON!

18:45.033 --> 18:47.967
I WON!

18:47.967 --> 18:50.700
AND I'M GLAD
WHAT I DONE!

18:50.700 --> 18:53.133
IT'S A GOOD THING WE DIDN'T GO
TO THE HEADSHRINKER.

18:53.133 --> 18:55.067
I TOLD YOU GUYS
THERAPY WAS A CROCK.

18:55.067 --> 18:56.700
THEY TAKE YOUR MONEY
AND THEN,

18:56.700 --> 18:58.467
WHEN YOU NEED THE GUY,
LIKE TODAY,

18:58.467 --> 19:00.500
HE'S DOIN' SOMETHING ELSE.

19:05.767 --> 19:08.867
- THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE, RAY.

19:08.867 --> 19:10.267
- NO, DEBRA,
COME ON, LOOK.

19:10.267 --> 19:12.200
THIS WAS SUPPOSED
TO MAKE US HAPPIER, RIGHT?

19:12.200 --> 19:14.100
WELL, WE'RE ALL HAPPY NOW.

19:14.100 --> 19:17.733
- THIS IS DIRTY HAPPINESS.

19:17.733 --> 19:19.600
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU DID.

19:19.600 --> 19:21.467
YOU PLAYED ON
OUR SENSITIVITIES.

19:21.467 --> 19:23.033
YOU TOOK ADVANTAGE OF US.

19:23.033 --> 19:25.067
YOU KNEW I WOULD BE
SO PROUD OF YOU

19:25.067 --> 19:27.633
THAT I'D LET YOU SLIDE
ON EVERYTHING AROUND HERE,

19:27.633 --> 19:29.300
INCLUDING ME!

19:33.200 --> 19:34.567
- ALL RIGHT, OKAY.

19:34.567 --> 19:36.533
BUT WE REALLY DID
WORK STUFF OUT.

19:36.533 --> 19:37.567
RIGHT, GUYS?

19:37.567 --> 19:39.467
- YOU KNOW, WE DID.
WE REALLY DID.

19:39.467 --> 19:43.000
I MEAN, WE HAD TO FOR OUR
MADE-UP CRAP TO BE BELIEVABLE.

19:44.833 --> 19:46.567
- IT'S TRUE.

19:46.567 --> 19:48.967
- SOMETHING GOOD HAPPENED WHILE
WE WEREN'T GOING TO THERAPY.

19:48.967 --> 19:52.700
ME AND DAD AND ROBERT,
WE ENJOYED BEIN' TOGETHER,

19:52.700 --> 19:56.567
AND WE LAUGHED AND...
WE FOUND OUT STUFF.

19:56.567 --> 19:59.767
SO YOU DON'T
HAVE TO BE MAD,

19:59.767 --> 20:01.933
BECAUSE WHAT YOU WANTED US
TO GET OUT OF THERAPY,

20:01.933 --> 20:03.033
WE KIND OF DID.

20:03.033 --> 20:05.233
AND WE FEEL GOOD NOW...

20:05.233 --> 20:07.267
EXCEPT FOR
THE DEAD DOCTOR PART.

20:08.700 --> 20:13.833
BUT I CAN HONESTLY SAY
THAT WE ARE BETTER PEOPLE NOW.

20:13.833 --> 20:15.533
YOU'VE SEEN IT.

20:16.800 --> 20:20.033
SO CAN'T YOU BE
A LITTLE HAPPY FOR US?

20:20.033 --> 20:23.700
- I AM HAPPY FOR YOU.

20:23.700 --> 20:26.667
BUT DON'T TOUCH ME.

20:26.667 --> 20:27.767
- DEB.

20:27.767 --> 20:30.200
- I NEED A 10-FOOT RADIUS.

20:33.200 --> 20:35.033
- NO DINNER FOR YOU!

20:38.433 --> 20:42.533
- I'M VERY DISAPPOINTED
IN YOU, ROBERT.

20:54.867 --> 20:56.633
- WHO DO I TALK TO?

21:07.300 --> 21:09.167
- EXPLAIN IT AGAIN,
COUSIN BELLA,

21:09.167 --> 21:12.833
BECAUSE I REALLY WANT HIM
TO UNDERSTAND IT.

21:12.833 --> 21:14.533
- WELL, FRANK...

21:17.100 --> 21:18.367
IT IS MY OPINION

21:18.367 --> 21:20.300
THAT THIS
LACK OF COMMUNICATION

21:20.300 --> 21:22.800
COMES FROM
YOUR FEAR OF INTIMACY.

21:22.800 --> 21:25.633
BUT WHAT YOU NEED TO DO

21:25.633 --> 21:28.133
IS LISTEN TO YOUR WIFE
WHEN SHE SPEAKS.

21:28.133 --> 21:30.533
REALLY LISTEN TO HER,

21:30.533 --> 21:33.200
BECAUSE IT'S IMPORTANT
THAT SHE KNOWS

21:33.200 --> 21:34.533
YOU CARE ABOUT HER.

21:34.533 --> 21:37.267
SO WE WILL EXPLORE
THIS TOGETHER

21:37.267 --> 21:41.667
OVER THE NEXT THREE WEEKS
THAT I'M HERE.

21:45.000 --> 21:47.367
WHAT ARE YOU FEELING, FRANK?

21:48.233 --> 21:50.400
- WHAT AM I FEELING?
