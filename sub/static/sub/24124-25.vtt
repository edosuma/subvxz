WEBVTT

00:00.291 --> 00:03.291
I gotta get goin'

00:03.291 --> 00:06.875
a friend of mine

00:08.500 --> 00:11.333
he's just Pooh Bear

00:14.000 --> 00:17.458
chasin' some honeybees

00:17.458 --> 00:20.875
I know he's out there

00:24.458 --> 00:28.000
we're so adventurous

00:28.000 --> 00:31.166
and again

00:31.166 --> 00:34.833
and there's nobody home

00:34.833 --> 00:38.208
to count on a friend

00:38.208 --> 00:41.708
Winnie the Pooh Bear

00:43.833 --> 00:45.250
take me, please?

00:45.250 --> 00:48.708
I got to be there

00:50.708 --> 00:55.875
Winnie the Pooh

01:13.750 --> 01:18.958
Looks like we got
a southwestern
blowing through.

01:18.958 --> 01:21.750
Last time we had
a wind this hard,

01:21.750 --> 01:24.083
it took the bark
right off the trees.

01:32.708 --> 01:34.875
Well! By dinghy!

01:34.875 --> 01:39.083
That crazy wind's gone
and blown my front door off.

01:39.083 --> 01:40.458
Ha ha ha!

01:40.458 --> 01:42.000
I can't lose that hole.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.125
The best I ever dug.

01:45.125 --> 01:46.583
Hey!

01:46.583 --> 01:47.875
Gotcha!

01:49.083 --> 01:51.083
Yaah!

01:54.958 --> 01:58.166
Follow that hole!

01:58.166 --> 02:00.875
Is it time? Is it time?

02:00.875 --> 02:04.875
I think the wind has
gone home now, Tigger.

02:04.875 --> 02:08.583
Ha ha ha! There she blows!

02:13.750 --> 02:16.458
Attention, everyone. Ahem.

02:16.458 --> 02:18.583
I have an announcement.

02:20.458 --> 02:22.958
Have a bubble, long ears,
and join the fun.

02:22.958 --> 02:24.583
Uh, no, thank you very much.

02:24.583 --> 02:27.708
I have more important
things to do,

02:27.708 --> 02:29.583
such as getting ready

02:29.583 --> 02:33.750
for my lecture this evening
on "Our Friend the Lima Bean,"

02:33.750 --> 02:37.708
which I'm sure
you'll all want to hear.

02:37.708 --> 02:39.166
Oh!

02:39.166 --> 02:43.000
Say, anybody seen a hole?

02:43.000 --> 02:46.750
- A whole what?
- A whole hole,
that's what.

02:46.750 --> 02:48.333
Why are you so excited?

02:48.333 --> 02:51.000
A hole isn't anything.
It's just nothing.

02:51.000 --> 02:53.375
Well, it's something to me.

02:53.375 --> 02:54.833
Nothing is something?

02:54.833 --> 02:56.291
No! No!

02:56.291 --> 02:59.458
This nothing
is something, and--

02:59.458 --> 03:02.750
Ah! What are you trying
to do, confuse me?

03:02.750 --> 03:07.125
Huh. Imagine worrying about
something as silly as a hole.

03:07.125 --> 03:08.875
Remember, everyone,

03:08.875 --> 03:12.000
"Our Friend the Lima Bean"
tonight.

03:13.291 --> 03:14.583
Oh, you know, Tigger,

03:14.583 --> 03:17.500
these bubbles
are very lovely,

03:17.500 --> 03:21.500
but they don't stay
very lovely very long.

03:21.500 --> 03:24.708
Hey. Long-lasting bubbles.

03:24.708 --> 03:27.583
That sounds like an invention
that needs inventing.

03:27.583 --> 03:29.083
Hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo!

03:32.375 --> 03:36.083
Hmm. Must have used
too many jalapeÃ±os.

03:36.083 --> 03:38.625
Better add
a little more glue

03:38.625 --> 03:41.416
and a lot more honey.

03:41.416 --> 03:44.458
And a little more of this
and a dash of that

03:44.458 --> 03:47.333
and a few of these
and one of those.

03:47.333 --> 03:50.125
A pinch of them and--

03:50.125 --> 03:52.125
Ah. That ought to do it.

04:03.375 --> 04:05.125
It-- it's incredibibble.

04:05.125 --> 04:06.708
It's-- It's stupenderous!

04:06.708 --> 04:08.000
It's-- It--

04:08.000 --> 04:09.875
It's even
got a pooh in it.

04:09.875 --> 04:13.125
I've got to test
the bustability
of this bubble.

04:15.500 --> 04:19.000
Success! The first
unbustable bubble!

04:19.000 --> 04:20.208
Hoo hoo hoo hoo!

04:20.208 --> 04:21.416
Absopolilutely

04:21.416 --> 04:23.208
can't be pooped--
I mean popped.

04:23.208 --> 04:26.458
Uh, Tigger, if you
can't get in the bubble,

04:26.458 --> 04:28.000
how will Pooh get out?

04:28.000 --> 04:30.875
Ha ha ha! Why, he'll just--

04:30.875 --> 04:32.166
hee hee-- he'll--

04:33.583 --> 04:35.708
Say, how are you gonna
get out of there?

04:35.708 --> 04:38.208
The same way I got in.

04:38.208 --> 04:39.875
Right. Uh...

04:40.875 --> 04:42.000
how was that?

04:42.000 --> 04:45.375
I was hoping you'd know.

04:51.500 --> 04:52.583
Whoa!

04:52.583 --> 04:54.083
Oh, d-d-dear!

04:54.083 --> 04:58.250
Oh, where's that consarn hole?

04:58.250 --> 04:59.708
Huh?

04:59.708 --> 05:02.000
Yaah!

05:02.000 --> 05:04.750
Gopher, Pooh's stuck
in a bubble.

05:07.125 --> 05:10.000
Hmm. So he is.

05:10.000 --> 05:11.625
Can't worry about that now.

05:11.625 --> 05:14.958
Got to find that hole.
Here, hole. Here, boy.

05:16.750 --> 05:19.125
Don't worry, buddy bear.
I'll unbubble you

05:19.125 --> 05:21.958
if it's the last thing I do
before lunch.

05:21.958 --> 05:24.125
If you want to...

05:24.125 --> 05:25.291
break something,

05:25.291 --> 05:27.625
y-you've got to drop it.

05:27.625 --> 05:29.958
Always works for me.

05:31.125 --> 05:34.333
Tally ho-ho-ho-ho-ho!

05:34.333 --> 05:35.583
Do you think it'll work?

05:35.583 --> 05:37.458
- Of course it'll work,

05:37.458 --> 05:40.083
- or my name isn't--
- Tigger!

05:40.083 --> 05:41.166
Ha ha ha!

05:41.166 --> 05:42.625
- Exactically.
-

05:42.625 --> 05:45.625
- Huh?
- I hate to complain,

05:45.625 --> 05:47.625
- but I'm getting a bit--
-

05:47.625 --> 05:49.333
...dizzy.

05:52.833 --> 05:55.083
Tigger: A little more
to your right.

05:55.083 --> 05:57.416
Uh, your other right.

05:57.416 --> 05:59.416
This will get that bubble
unbubbled.

05:59.416 --> 06:01.333
I certainly hope so.

06:01.333 --> 06:02.458
Fire!

06:06.125 --> 06:08.208
Here, hole! Here-- Oh!

06:10.375 --> 06:12.416
Look at the bright side,
Pooh boy.

06:12.416 --> 06:14.375
If it rains, uh, uh,

06:14.375 --> 06:17.166
you'll never need
an umbreller.

06:17.166 --> 06:21.375
You mean I'm going
to be in here forever?

06:21.375 --> 06:23.958
There, there, Pooh.
You'll stay with me

06:23.958 --> 06:25.458
until we can break
the bubble.

06:28.583 --> 06:32.166
Pooh: Can I help you
with the cleaning, Piglet?

06:32.166 --> 06:33.625
Certainly, Pooh.

06:35.416 --> 06:37.208
- Oh, bother.

06:37.208 --> 06:39.625
- Oh, d-d-dear.

06:41.125 --> 06:42.875
Yipe!

06:42.875 --> 06:45.583
I'm trying to go this way,

06:45.583 --> 06:48.333
but the bubble wants
to go that way.

06:50.000 --> 06:51.125
Um...

06:59.708 --> 07:04.000
Uh, Pooh, uh, perhaps Tigger
needs some help at his house?

07:05.125 --> 07:06.833
--

07:06.833 --> 07:08.833
load off your bubble,
buddy bear.

07:08.833 --> 07:14.000
But, Tigger, I don't
want to be any...

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
- trouble.
- Oh, ha ha ha!

07:16.000 --> 07:17.583
No trouble at all.

07:19.166 --> 07:20.208
Comfy?

07:20.208 --> 07:22.291
Well...

07:27.625 --> 07:30.708
Uh, maybe you would be
happier at Rabbit's?

07:31.833 --> 07:33.333
Bears and bubbles

07:33.333 --> 07:35.208
and holes and gophers.

07:35.208 --> 07:36.625
Don't they realize

07:36.625 --> 07:38.500
that I'm trying
to bring them some culture?

07:38.500 --> 07:40.583
Think thin, Pooh.

07:46.708 --> 07:48.416
Hello, Rabbit.

07:48.416 --> 07:50.250
Can I help you?

07:50.250 --> 07:52.708
Help me? Help me?

07:52.708 --> 07:56.083
Why, look what you've undone!

07:56.083 --> 07:58.375
You want to help?

07:58.375 --> 08:00.375
All right, Pooh.

08:00.375 --> 08:03.458
I know how you can help me.

08:04.708 --> 08:08.458
There. Now let's get it
in the tree.

08:08.458 --> 08:10.208
When the other apples see

08:10.208 --> 08:13.583
how wonderfully big
this apple is,

08:13.583 --> 08:15.250
they'll grow, too.

08:15.250 --> 08:18.875
And he'll be out of the way.

08:18.875 --> 08:22.500
Say, that hole showed up yet?

08:22.500 --> 08:24.333
Hmm.

08:24.333 --> 08:26.208
Ah. I know.

08:26.208 --> 08:28.125
I'll comb the forest

08:28.125 --> 08:30.208
till I find that thing.

08:30.208 --> 08:33.125
But, Rabbit, how will Pooh
come to your lecture

08:33.125 --> 08:35.458
on-- heh heh--
"Our Friend the Lima Bean"?

08:35.458 --> 08:38.375
Uh, I'm afraid I can't
have him there, Piglet,

08:38.375 --> 08:40.875
not with the way
he bangs into everything.

08:40.875 --> 08:43.416
- He's just too much trouble.

08:46.333 --> 08:48.125
Oh, bother.

08:49.708 --> 08:53.000
I wish I weren't
such a bother to everyone.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.416
Rabbit:
"Our Friend the Lima Bean."

08:55.416 --> 08:57.958
When many lima beans
get together

08:57.958 --> 08:59.708
and go for a swim,

08:59.708 --> 09:02.416
this we call bean soup.

09:02.416 --> 09:06.333
Ehh. I'm never gonna
find that hole.

09:06.333 --> 09:07.750
Hello, Gopher.

09:07.750 --> 09:11.083
Huh? Uh, still in there, huh?

09:11.083 --> 09:13.958
What are you doing
hanging in a tree?

09:13.958 --> 09:18.166
It seems to be the only
place I'm not in the way.

09:18.166 --> 09:22.875
Uh, guess you and me are both
kind of unwelcome these days.

09:22.875 --> 09:25.708
By crackety, don't they see?

09:25.708 --> 09:27.375
If I could find that hole,

09:27.375 --> 09:30.000
I'd have time
to be more sociable.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.875
I wish I could help,

09:31.875 --> 09:34.000
but the only hole
I know of

09:34.000 --> 09:35.708
is the one in my pocket.

09:35.708 --> 09:40.000
Hmm? Say, you got a hole
in your pocket?

09:40.000 --> 09:41.333
Ahem.

09:41.333 --> 09:43.375
Uh, could I get a look at it?

09:44.875 --> 09:47.375
By dinghy! There she is!

09:48.875 --> 09:51.750
Ah, I've been looking
all over for that thingy.

09:51.750 --> 09:54.500
Oh? I didn't know
it was yours.

09:54.500 --> 09:57.000
Well, Pooh Bear,
you're in luck.

09:57.000 --> 10:00.833
That's just the hole
we need to get you
out of there.

10:00.833 --> 10:03.875
Stick it on the side
of that bubble.

10:03.875 --> 10:05.708
It works.

10:06.708 --> 10:08.000
Oh, bother.

10:09.708 --> 10:13.333
Well, there's the best
one I ever dug.

10:13.333 --> 10:14.583
Heh heh heh heh.

10:15.875 --> 10:18.416
Yes, Piglet,
the garbanzo bean

10:18.416 --> 10:20.875
is a member of
the lima bean family,

10:20.875 --> 10:24.416
but not the immediate family.

10:24.416 --> 10:26.250
Now, who can tell us

10:26.250 --> 10:29.583
which is the most
intelligent of all beans?

10:29.583 --> 10:32.083
Piglet! Tigger! Rabbit!

10:32.083 --> 10:34.583
Gopher found
his missing hole.

10:36.625 --> 10:37.875
Good as new.

10:37.875 --> 10:40.375
Pooh, the bubble's gone.

10:40.375 --> 10:43.083
Yes, Piglet.
Or as I was saying,

10:43.083 --> 10:45.500
Gopher found his hole
in my pocket.

10:45.500 --> 10:47.958
Buddy bear! You're you!

10:47.958 --> 10:51.208
Of course, Tigger.
I always was me.

10:51.208 --> 10:53.291
I was just me inside a bubble.

10:53.291 --> 10:58.375
But we treated you
differently.

10:58.375 --> 11:01.291
Yeah. We kinda forgot
about you.

11:01.291 --> 11:02.833
Well, that's all right.

11:02.833 --> 11:04.000
I'm back now.

11:04.000 --> 11:05.583
Hey! Ahem.

11:05.583 --> 11:07.458
What about me?

11:07.458 --> 11:10.583
Doesn't anyone want to see
this baby in action?

11:10.583 --> 11:14.000
Please, Gopher,
no more hole silliness.

11:14.000 --> 11:16.875
Silliness, hmm?

11:16.875 --> 11:20.958
I was just about to discuss
the social life of the lima--

11:20.958 --> 11:24.125
Aah!

11:24.125 --> 11:25.458
- ...bean.

11:26.458 --> 11:28.708
Ha! Now what do you think?

11:28.708 --> 11:29.875
Hmm?

11:29.875 --> 11:32.583
Ah, I have a whole new
outlook on...

11:32.583 --> 11:34.166
holes.

11:43.000 --> 11:45.458
Gangway! Hoo hoo hoo hoo!

11:45.458 --> 11:47.166
Ha ha ha ha!

11:47.166 --> 11:50.000
I'm gonna bust every
ski jumping record there is.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.416
I'm gonna ski

11:51.416 --> 11:54.083
where no tigger's
skied before.

11:54.083 --> 11:57.583
But, uh, Tigger,
Tigger, how can you ski--

11:57.583 --> 11:59.458
When there's no snow?

11:59.458 --> 12:02.500
No snow! Ha ha ha ha!

12:02.500 --> 12:04.708
Why, of course there's--

12:04.708 --> 12:06.500
No snow?

12:06.500 --> 12:08.875
Hey, what gives here?

12:08.875 --> 12:10.458
We ought to be swimming in it.

12:10.458 --> 12:12.458
We ought to be
slathering in it.

12:12.458 --> 12:15.000
Why, today's the first
day of winter.

12:16.208 --> 12:17.208
Isn't it?

12:19.208 --> 12:20.958
I don't know, Tigger.

12:20.958 --> 12:22.708
My watch stopped.

12:30.708 --> 12:34.375
There. As clean as a whistle.

12:38.458 --> 12:41.375
Hey, bunny boy! Yoo-hoo!

12:41.375 --> 12:42.458
Anybody home?

13:00.458 --> 13:03.458
What are you doing?

13:03.458 --> 13:05.125
Well, we're trying
to find out

13:05.125 --> 13:06.958
when winter is,
long ears.

13:06.958 --> 13:10.708
And you're the only one
with a calendar, Rabbit.

13:10.708 --> 13:15.583
Why, ahem, oh, I, uh,
yes. So I am.

13:15.583 --> 13:17.458
Ahem. Well, let's see.

13:17.458 --> 13:20.250
As of first thing
this morning,

13:20.250 --> 13:24.000
today is Groundhog Day.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.166
Groundhog Day?

13:26.166 --> 13:28.208
Groundhog Day?

13:28.208 --> 13:29.458
Groundhog Day?

13:29.458 --> 13:32.291
Oh, it's Groundhog Day.

13:32.291 --> 13:35.333
Uh, what's a groundhog day?

13:35.333 --> 13:36.833
Ha ha ha ha!

13:36.833 --> 13:39.000
Why, everybody knows
that, buddy bear.

13:40.208 --> 13:42.750
It's a-- a-- uh...

13:42.750 --> 13:46.208
Well, it's the day
a groundhog comes
out of his hole.

13:46.208 --> 13:47.750
Precisively.

13:49.000 --> 13:51.125
And if he sees his shadow,

13:51.125 --> 13:54.000
that means there will be
six more weeks of winter.

13:54.000 --> 13:57.583
But if he doesn't,
spring starts tomorrow.

13:57.583 --> 14:00.000
Exac-- Spring?

14:00.000 --> 14:02.750
Uh, but what
happened to winter?

14:02.750 --> 14:06.333
It's gone. Over. We missed it.

14:06.333 --> 14:08.000
Christmas, too?

14:08.000 --> 14:11.291
According to the calendar,
Christmas, too.

14:11.291 --> 14:14.875
But the only way
to be completely
sure winter is over

14:14.875 --> 14:17.875
is to find a groundhog
and check with him.

14:20.125 --> 14:22.250
Hmm? Groundhog?

14:22.250 --> 14:24.250
Who are you calling
a groundhog?

14:24.250 --> 14:26.708
I'm a gopher, not a groundhog.

14:28.416 --> 14:32.625
What are you trying to do,
insult my ancestors?

14:32.625 --> 14:33.708
Hmph.

14:33.708 --> 14:37.708
Yaah!

14:39.708 --> 14:42.250
Now where would we
find a groundhog

14:42.250 --> 14:43.750
to see if spring's here?

14:46.583 --> 14:49.250
Oh! D-D-Dear.

14:51.375 --> 14:53.583
As a very small
and timid animal,

14:53.583 --> 14:56.000
I have enough trouble
being just a piglet.

14:56.000 --> 14:57.416
Perhaps someone else could--

14:57.416 --> 14:59.750
Nonsense. You're a perfect--

15:01.208 --> 15:02.458
groundhog.

15:02.458 --> 15:05.166
Do you see your shadow,
Piglet?

15:05.166 --> 15:07.708
Oh, please,
please see your shadow.

15:07.708 --> 15:08.958
I want to go skiing.

15:11.708 --> 15:14.375
Actually, I don't see a thing.

15:14.375 --> 15:15.958
No shadow?

15:15.958 --> 15:17.875
Hoo hoo! Winter's over!

15:17.875 --> 15:19.000
It's gone!

15:19.000 --> 15:21.166
Oh, hooray!

15:21.166 --> 15:23.000
You're a hero,
Groundpiglet,

15:23.000 --> 15:24.750
for telling us
spring is here.

15:24.750 --> 15:27.000
- Tigger: Yippee!
- Hooray for Piglet!

15:27.000 --> 15:29.500
Hooray for Piglet!
Hoo hoo hoo hoo!

15:29.500 --> 15:32.125
Come on, everyone. We have
to get ready for spring.

15:32.125 --> 15:33.958
There's a lot to do.

15:33.958 --> 15:35.333
Like what, Rabbit?

15:36.375 --> 15:38.208
Oh, a great many things,

15:38.208 --> 15:41.500
such as, uh, airing out
our houses...

15:42.958 --> 15:45.458
and spring cleaning.

15:47.875 --> 15:50.375
And most important of all,

15:50.375 --> 15:51.708
my garden.

15:51.708 --> 15:54.458
The secret to great
gardening, Piglet,

15:54.458 --> 15:56.500
is knowing when to plant.

15:56.500 --> 15:58.000
And, thanks to you,

15:58.000 --> 16:00.625
I know that when is now.

16:03.000 --> 16:05.458
All my friends are certainly
very happy with me,

16:05.458 --> 16:07.416
and I suppose they should be.

16:07.416 --> 16:11.083
After all, I-- I did
tell them winter was over.

16:20.083 --> 16:24.583
Hmm. Unusual weather
we're having this spring.

16:33.125 --> 16:34.291
Oh, bother.

16:37.458 --> 16:39.000
Spring?

16:40.125 --> 16:42.125
Groundhog?

16:42.125 --> 16:44.375
Ooh, that Piglet.

16:47.291 --> 16:50.375
Piglet, you said
you didn't see your shadow.

16:50.375 --> 16:52.500
You told us winter was over.

16:52.500 --> 16:56.500
Oh, dear. I did, didn't I?

16:56.500 --> 16:59.208
We prepared
for spring.

16:59.208 --> 17:02.833
There should be fields
full of flowers,

17:02.833 --> 17:05.375
not 6 feet of snow.

17:05.375 --> 17:08.000
Ruined! Ruined!

17:08.000 --> 17:10.583
And it's all your fault.

17:17.375 --> 17:21.000
I'm sorry you have to be
out in weather like this.

17:23.833 --> 17:25.583
Ah-choo!

17:25.583 --> 17:26.833
Gesundheit.

17:36.333 --> 17:38.875
Oh, uh, what's this?

17:38.875 --> 17:41.000
Calendar pages?

17:41.000 --> 17:43.166
Why, it's-- it's--

17:46.583 --> 17:48.750
It's only November.

17:48.750 --> 17:51.750
It's nowhere near
Groundhog Day.

17:51.750 --> 17:55.583
Hmm. Piglet wasn't quite
as wrong as I'd thought.

17:55.583 --> 17:57.833
Piglet? Oh, my.

17:57.833 --> 18:00.083
I'd better apologize to him.

18:01.291 --> 18:03.583
Piglet. Piglet--

18:04.708 --> 18:05.750
Piglet:I've gone

18:05.750 --> 18:07.875
to find a real groundhog

18:07.875 --> 18:10.875
who can tell me
when spring really is.

18:10.875 --> 18:12.250
He must be kidding.

18:12.250 --> 18:15.875
P.S. I'm--
I'm n-not kidding.

18:18.083 --> 18:19.083
Piglet?

18:25.458 --> 18:26.708
Piglet?

18:30.583 --> 18:31.750
Piglet!

18:37.958 --> 18:40.083
Groundhog!

18:40.083 --> 18:42.750
Oh, groundhog!

18:42.750 --> 18:44.750
Groundhog.

18:44.750 --> 18:47.125
Calling
all groundhogs.

18:47.125 --> 18:49.708
I don't remember saying that.

18:50.958 --> 18:52.958
Perhaps they just
can't hear me

18:52.958 --> 18:54.583
under all this snow.

18:56.083 --> 18:58.291
Groundhog.

19:01.333 --> 19:03.458
Oh, d-d-dear.

19:06.416 --> 19:08.125
I think the groundhogs

19:08.125 --> 19:10.333
must have flown south
for the winter.

19:10.333 --> 19:13.875
Perhaps I should try
to find one later,

19:13.875 --> 19:16.250
like some time
next spring.

19:21.583 --> 19:24.708
Oh, where could he be?

19:30.416 --> 19:32.583
There you are, Piglet.

19:32.583 --> 19:35.416
You shouldn't have come
out here all alone.

19:35.416 --> 19:36.583
Piglet?

19:38.958 --> 19:41.166
Oh, no!

19:41.166 --> 19:44.583
--
frozen solid.

19:44.583 --> 19:46.625
I have to get you
home quickly

19:46.625 --> 19:48.000
and warmed up.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.750
He's so cold,
he can't even speak.

19:50.750 --> 19:53.083
Here's some hot chocolatey.

19:58.458 --> 20:01.000
He's sweating up
a storm. He's--

20:01.000 --> 20:03.875
He's sweating away to nothing!

20:03.875 --> 20:05.458
- He's melting!

20:05.458 --> 20:07.958
He-- Get a bucket!
We have to save him!

20:07.958 --> 20:10.750
Tigger, you're stepping
in Piglet!

20:17.250 --> 20:20.083
Oh, poor Piglet.

20:20.083 --> 20:21.166
Ohh.

20:21.166 --> 20:23.458
He's gonna faint!

20:23.458 --> 20:24.458
Tigger!

20:26.208 --> 20:27.583
Piglet! Piglet!

20:27.583 --> 20:28.708
How do you feel?

20:28.708 --> 20:31.333
Well, I feel very badly

20:31.333 --> 20:34.000
for saying it was spring
in the middle of winter.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.875
What? That?

20:35.875 --> 20:37.583
Oh, don't worry about that.

20:37.583 --> 20:39.583
It was all my fault!

20:39.583 --> 20:42.333
But-- But I was the groundhog.

20:42.333 --> 20:44.416
But my calendar.

20:44.416 --> 20:46.416
Snow. Spring. Winter.

20:46.416 --> 20:48.250
The pages. Ohh!

20:48.250 --> 20:50.416
I never should have asked you

20:50.416 --> 20:53.416
to be a groundhog
in the first place.

20:53.416 --> 20:55.333
Do you understand?

20:55.333 --> 20:56.625
I think.

20:56.625 --> 20:59.083
Can you ever forgive me?

20:59.083 --> 21:01.625
Of course, Rabbit.

21:02.708 --> 21:04.250
Did you hear that, Piglet?

21:04.250 --> 21:06.416
Piglet forgives me.

21:06.416 --> 21:07.708
Piglet!

21:07.708 --> 21:11.708
Piglet, you're unmelted!

21:11.708 --> 21:14.875
Piglet! You're all right!

21:14.875 --> 21:16.833
Yes. Uh, thank you.

21:18.250 --> 21:20.083
Oh, no!

21:20.083 --> 21:22.625
If that's Piglet,

21:22.625 --> 21:25.625
then who is this?

21:25.625 --> 21:29.083
Kinda resembles Eeyore,
uh, around the eyes.

21:29.083 --> 21:32.083
Heh heh. That was
just a pile of snow.

21:32.083 --> 21:34.458
I see.

21:34.458 --> 21:36.583
Uh, excuse me, Rabbit,

21:36.583 --> 21:38.583
but there is something
I've been wondering.

21:38.583 --> 21:40.458
If it isn't spring
and it isn't winter

21:40.458 --> 21:42.291
and it isn't Groundhog Day,

21:42.291 --> 21:43.875
what day is today?

21:43.875 --> 21:46.708
It's November 13th,
Piglet.

21:46.708 --> 21:48.708
November 13th?

21:48.708 --> 21:50.958
November 13th?

21:50.958 --> 21:53.416
Do you realize
what this means?

21:53.416 --> 21:55.250
It's Porkypine Day!

21:55.250 --> 21:58.458
And if a porkypine
sees his uncle Ralph

21:58.458 --> 22:00.708
or a teakettle
on Porkypine Day--

22:00.708 --> 22:03.125
-- then you'll
have to eat nothing

22:03.125 --> 22:05.458
but stewed vegebibbles
for three months.

22:05.458 --> 22:07.208
Three months!

22:07.208 --> 22:10.708
Heh heh. We-- We got to
find us a porkypine.
