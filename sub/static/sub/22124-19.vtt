There's no sign of Maze
at any of the usual spots.

09:20.603 --> 09:22.083
And she's not
answering my calls.

09:22.126 --> 09:24.041
Most definitely the actions
of an innocent woman.

09:24.085 --> 09:25.434
Well, let's not jump
to conclusions.

09:25.477 --> 09:27.218
It's not like the
video shows her

09:27.262 --> 09:28.568
actually stabbing our vic.

09:28.611 --> 09:30.395
No. Merely plucking

09:30.439 --> 09:31.701
her knife out of his chest.

09:31.745 --> 09:33.703
Do you really think
she did this?

09:33.747 --> 09:35.705
I mean, yes, Maze is rash...

09:35.749 --> 09:37.054
Or nuclear, more like.

09:37.098 --> 09:38.578
There's got to be
another explanation.

09:38.621 --> 09:40.231
There is. It's about me.

09:40.275 --> 09:42.669
Maze asked me to take
her home, and I said no,

09:42.712 --> 09:44.409
at which point she
flew into a rage

09:44.453 --> 09:45.628
and threatened
to make me sorry.

09:45.672 --> 09:47.238
So she's clearly acting out.

09:47.282 --> 09:49.110
But if she thinks
she can manipulate me

09:49.153 --> 09:51.329
into changing my mind,
then she's sorely mistaken.

09:51.373 --> 09:53.331
So you didn't give her
a ride home one night.

09:53.375 --> 09:55.551
I mean, call me crazy, but
that doesn't make someone kill.

09:55.595 --> 09:56.552
[sighs]

09:56.596 --> 09:57.553
Hey.

09:57.597 --> 09:59.337
Hey there, Lieutenant.

09:59.381 --> 10:01.601
[clears throat]:
Um... any updates?

10:01.644 --> 10:04.081
Mm-hmm. Our vic
is an ex-con

10:04.125 --> 10:05.300
named Mike Biltz.

10:05.343 --> 10:07.084
Hmm. An active bounty
of Mazikeen Smith.

10:07.128 --> 10:08.259
Hmm.
Well, Maze bounties

10:08.303 --> 10:09.478
a lot of people, you know.

10:09.521 --> 10:11.262
She's a overachiever, that Maze.

10:11.306 --> 10:12.612
She's had a prior run-in
with him.

10:12.655 --> 10:14.265
It says she brought him in
once before.

10:14.309 --> 10:16.267
So she knows him--
it doesn't mean anything.

10:16.311 --> 10:18.443
Or one very obvious thing--
guilty.

10:18.487 --> 10:20.620
Chloe, is this case
too personal for you?

10:20.663 --> 10:23.100
Maybe your roommate
isn't who you think she is.

10:23.144 --> 10:25.189
Ex-roommate. I'm just saying.All right,

10:25.233 --> 10:26.495
well, I'll need you
to stay impartial.

10:26.538 --> 10:28.758
Copy that. I'll keep it
completely professional.

10:28.802 --> 10:30.325
Where as I, on the other hand,

10:30.368 --> 10:31.979
will keep things
entirely personal.

10:32.022 --> 10:34.590
I will not rest until we track
down that manipulative demon.

10:34.634 --> 10:37.114
In fact, I'm gonna go and
look for Maze again now.

10:37.158 --> 10:38.725
All right. Great.
I'm gonna check out a lead

10:38.768 --> 10:41.379
on our vic's last place
of employment-- some winery

10:41.423 --> 10:42.598
called Monte De Oro.

10:42.642 --> 10:43.468
I'll go with you.

10:43.512 --> 10:44.687
Okay.

10:44.731 --> 10:46.341
Uh, no need, Lieutenant.

10:46.384 --> 10:49.126
Actually, on second thought, I
think I should make 100% certain

10:49.170 --> 10:52.390
of Maze's guilt before
I find and punish her.

10:52.434 --> 10:53.609
Come on, partner.

10:53.653 --> 10:55.611
Okay.

10:55.655 --> 10:57.526
Hmm. We'll take
my car, shall we?

10:57.569 --> 11:01.269
♪ Too many girls

11:01.312 --> 11:05.229
♪ Living in my home

11:05.273 --> 11:07.144
♪ Got to tell them to leave

11:07.188 --> 11:08.711
♪ I want to be alone...

11:08.755 --> 11:11.496
So romantic, the California
coastline, isn't it?

11:11.540 --> 11:14.195
Yeah. Yeah, it really is.Mm.

11:14.238 --> 11:16.197
Speaking of...
[clears throat]

11:16.240 --> 11:18.547
That beach date
that you went on with Pierce,

11:18.590 --> 11:20.549
was it a datedate?

11:20.592 --> 11:22.507
Um, it was just
a regular date.

11:22.551 --> 11:23.639
Ah.

11:23.683 --> 11:25.162
Well, you're free
to spend your...

11:25.206 --> 11:27.208
your spare time
with whomever you choose.

11:27.251 --> 11:29.297
I mean, I'm not one
for gorilla-sized ham hands

11:29.340 --> 11:32.779
or stale alcohol breath or,
yeah, just the general blokes,

11:32.822 --> 11:35.695
but I suppose there's no
accounting for taste, is there?

11:35.738 --> 11:37.435
No. No, there's not.

11:37.479 --> 11:39.176
No-- also, I-I'm surprised

11:39.220 --> 11:41.570
that you'd date someone
so on in years.

11:41.613 --> 11:43.703
Huh? What are you
talking about?

11:43.746 --> 11:45.530
Oh, believe me, Pierce is, uh,

11:45.574 --> 11:47.707
well, he's much older
than he looks.

11:47.750 --> 11:50.405
And we all know that dating
older men has its downsides:

11:50.448 --> 11:52.189
performance, stamina,
you know, the important bits.

11:52.233 --> 11:53.625
Okay, Lucifer...

11:53.669 --> 11:55.715
Well, I just hate to see you
unsatisfied, that's all.

11:55.758 --> 11:58.282
Lucifer, I'm not
discussing this with you.

11:58.326 --> 11:59.719
Okay, okay.
Okay?

11:59.762 --> 12:01.764
Besides, Pierce and I,
we're not even sleeping to...

12:01.808 --> 12:03.766
You know, we're not...

12:03.810 --> 12:06.377
We're not, and never mind,
and it's none of your business.

12:06.421 --> 12:07.857
So, how far are we?
Are we there?

12:07.901 --> 12:10.207
Uh, we're nearly there.

12:10.251 --> 12:11.905
Okay.

12:13.907 --> 12:16.605
Thank you for talking
with us, Mrs. Channing.

12:16.648 --> 12:19.390
Please, call me Margo.

12:19.434 --> 12:21.871
Tragic news.

12:21.915 --> 12:23.873
We want to help any way we can.

12:23.917 --> 12:26.746
Great. Um, well,
what can you tell us about Mike?

12:26.789 --> 12:28.008
Well, Zack would know better.

12:28.051 --> 12:30.793
He's the winery foreman
and Mike's supervisor.

12:30.837 --> 12:32.708
Okay.
ZACK:
He was a good worker.

12:32.752 --> 12:34.318
Quiet. Never gave
us any trouble.

12:34.362 --> 12:36.756
Mm-hmm. And did you all know
he had a criminal record

12:36.799 --> 12:38.235
and that he was currently
out on bail?

12:38.279 --> 12:39.889
No, I wasn't.

12:39.933 --> 12:41.586
It's always the quiet ones,
isn't it?

12:41.630 --> 12:43.414
The truth is,

12:43.458 --> 12:45.503
if we looked too closely
at all our workers,

12:45.547 --> 12:47.375
there'd be no one left
to tend the grapes.

12:47.418 --> 12:49.246
Way I saw it, Mike
was a good guy.

12:49.290 --> 12:50.770
He deserved better.

12:50.813 --> 12:53.381
And did you notice anything
strange in the last few weeks?

12:53.424 --> 12:54.469
Uh, any fights

12:54.512 --> 12:55.426
that he got in or
money troubles?

12:55.470 --> 12:56.688
Anything like that?

12:56.732 --> 12:57.907
ZACK: Well, there was
something the other day.

12:57.951 --> 12:59.387
Someone came looking for him.

12:59.430 --> 13:02.259
Ah, was it a...
a hot woman, perhaps?

13:02.303 --> 13:04.261
Angry? Leather? Lots of knives?

13:04.305 --> 13:05.872
Or someone completely different?

13:05.915 --> 13:08.657
Like a dude?
Like a fat, happy dude?ZACK: No.

13:08.700 --> 13:10.180
What he said.

13:10.224 --> 13:12.443
A pretty woman in black leather
came looking for Mike.

13:12.487 --> 13:14.924
Right. Well, Morningstar,
one, Decker, nil.

13:14.968 --> 13:16.926
Not that I'm counting.Anyhow, carry on.

13:16.970 --> 13:18.667
ZACK: Uh, Mike was out
at the time,

13:18.710 --> 13:21.278
so she hung around his trailer,
then took off.

13:21.322 --> 13:23.803
When I told him,
he kind of freaked out about it.

13:23.846 --> 13:25.935
Then I forgot all about it.

13:25.979 --> 13:28.895
Uh, could we get a look
at that trailer?

13:30.940 --> 13:33.943
Oh. Oh, this is
lovely, isn't it?

13:34.944 --> 13:36.816
Aha!

13:36.859 --> 13:38.730
Her favorite beverage.

13:38.774 --> 13:41.385
Well, surely this is evidence
that Maze is guilty.

13:41.429 --> 13:43.387
And well hydrated.

13:43.431 --> 13:45.737
Well, let's just wait
and see what the lab has to say.

13:45.781 --> 13:48.479
I'm sure lots of people
drink green tea coconut water.

13:48.523 --> 13:50.351
[scoffs] Right.

13:51.961 --> 13:54.877
I told you not to
talk to Charlotte,

13:54.921 --> 13:57.837
and you literally did the
exact opposite of what I said.

13:57.880 --> 14:00.317
Why bother asking
for my advice at all?

14:00.361 --> 14:02.015
I couldn't help it,
Linda, all right?

14:02.058 --> 14:03.581
I'm sorry.

14:03.625 --> 14:05.322
She's not your mother anymore.

14:05.366 --> 14:07.324
She's a human woman in pain

14:07.368 --> 14:09.326
who isn't ready
to hear what you have to say.

14:09.370 --> 14:10.806
Well, I disagree.

14:10.850 --> 14:13.417
She's in pain because
she doesn't know the full story.

14:13.461 --> 14:16.551
Whether or not she's my mother,
Linda, I owe her the truth.

14:17.987 --> 14:19.075
At least some of the truth.

14:19.119 --> 14:21.599
I didn't go into
the celestial details.

14:21.643 --> 14:23.732
And she can tell
you're holding back.

14:23.775 --> 14:25.865
And now she has more questions.

14:26.822 --> 14:27.997
I really thought we decided

14:28.041 --> 14:29.346
we weren't gonna do this.

14:29.390 --> 14:30.695
You mean youdecided.

14:30.739 --> 14:33.481
You decided, Linda.

14:33.524 --> 14:35.875
Just like how you decided
that we were over.

14:36.919 --> 14:39.748
Point taken.

14:39.791 --> 14:43.012
But Amenadiel, please,
ask yourself...

14:43.056 --> 14:45.014
are you doing this

14:45.058 --> 14:48.017
because you think
it's what's best for Charlotte,

14:48.061 --> 14:50.498
or what's best for you?

14:56.591 --> 14:57.505
Oh, my God.

14:57.548 --> 14:59.507
You guys are so adorable.

14:59.550 --> 15:00.638
I can't even stand it.

15:00.682 --> 15:02.379
Looks like you caught us, Lopez.

15:02.423 --> 15:04.599
Uh, hey. Did you get anything
back on the coconut water?

15:04.642 --> 15:07.907
Uh, no, but they are
rushing the order.

15:07.950 --> 15:09.734
Chloe.

15:09.778 --> 15:10.822
Hey.

15:10.866 --> 15:11.823
Pierce.

15:12.824 --> 15:14.565
I, uh, looked into

15:14.609 --> 15:15.740
other known associates
of the victim.

15:15.784 --> 15:17.525
Surviving family members,
etcetera.

15:17.568 --> 15:19.657
So far, no leads.Okay.

15:19.701 --> 15:21.529
Oh.

15:21.572 --> 15:23.009
Here, have a seat.

15:25.098 --> 15:27.143
Ah, lovely. Thank you very much.Yeah.

15:27.187 --> 15:28.579
It's not like
there's 20 other chairs.

15:28.623 --> 15:29.580
LUCIFER:
Ooh!

15:29.624 --> 15:30.799
All warmed up for me.

15:30.842 --> 15:32.714
So, any news
on our murderous friend?

15:32.757 --> 15:33.976
Listen, guys, if Maze did this,

15:34.020 --> 15:36.413
would any of you
really be shocked?

15:36.457 --> 15:37.414
Yeah.I would.

15:37.458 --> 15:38.633
No, not at all.There's no way.

15:38.676 --> 15:40.765
MAZE: Let me settle
it for you.

15:40.809 --> 15:42.942
I did it.

15:50.558 --> 15:51.559
What are you all waiting for?

15:51.602 --> 15:53.648
I just said I did it.

15:53.691 --> 15:54.866
Maze, hold on.

15:54.910 --> 15:56.085
You have the right
to remain silent.

15:56.129 --> 15:57.434
Anything you say

15:57.478 --> 15:59.045
can and will
be used against you...

15:59.088 --> 16:00.829
Don't have time for all of that.

16:00.872 --> 16:03.745
I'm the big, bad killer,
so let's move it along.

16:03.788 --> 16:05.703
Agreed. Let's book her.

16:05.747 --> 16:06.878
Lucifer,
it's called due process.

16:06.922 --> 16:08.054
She doesn't have to do this.

16:08.097 --> 16:09.794
The evidence against her
is circumstantial.

16:09.838 --> 16:11.971
Well, let me help you with that.

16:12.014 --> 16:14.582
Murder weapon should do it.

16:14.625 --> 16:16.671
Put it down. Now.

16:17.715 --> 16:19.239
All yours.

16:21.154 --> 16:23.765
Come on, boys.

16:23.808 --> 16:25.071
You know you want to.

16:27.029 --> 16:28.596
Stand up.Oh.

16:28.639 --> 16:29.771
Stand up.[grunts]

16:31.033 --> 16:32.730
[chuckles]

16:36.647 --> 16:38.475
I know this looks bad.

16:38.519 --> 16:39.650
We have a video,

16:39.694 --> 16:41.000
a murder weapon,
and a full confession.

16:41.043 --> 16:42.871
I know. It just...

16:42.914 --> 16:44.612
It doesn't feel like her.

16:44.655 --> 16:45.743
I thought you said you weren't
gonna let your feelings

16:45.787 --> 16:46.918
get in the way of this case.

16:46.962 --> 16:49.008
And I'm not.Just like you're not letting

16:49.051 --> 16:50.922
your feelings for Lucifer
get between you and me?

16:50.966 --> 16:52.707
W-What?

16:52.750 --> 16:54.100
Is there something going on...

16:54.143 --> 16:56.015
between you and Lucifer?

16:56.058 --> 16:58.800
No. No.

16:58.843 --> 17:01.063
Lucifer and I,
we-we're partners.

17:01.107 --> 17:02.630
We're friends.

17:02.673 --> 17:05.720
Do all your friends
give you jewelry?

17:05.763 --> 17:07.591
This?

17:08.940 --> 17:10.507
Lucifer gave me this as a joke.

17:10.551 --> 17:12.031
It's a funny story, actually.

17:12.074 --> 17:14.511
[laughs]: He says
it was the closest I ever came

17:14.555 --> 17:15.773
to penetrating him.

17:16.731 --> 17:17.688
Which, see,

17:17.732 --> 17:19.168
we've never actually had sex.

17:19.212 --> 17:20.909
Oh.
Never mind.

17:20.952 --> 17:22.824
[clears throat]It just...
It was funny at the time.

17:22.867 --> 17:24.260
Well, we're gonna book Maze.

17:24.304 --> 17:26.523
If you really believe
she's innocent,

17:26.567 --> 17:27.959
you're gonna have to bring in
the real killer.

17:28.003 --> 17:29.700
I'll start by talking to her.

17:31.180 --> 17:33.530

No.Right.

17:54.073 --> 17:55.552
Look, I've told you
already, Detective,

17:55.596 --> 17:57.772
she is doing this
to manipulate me.

17:57.815 --> 17:58.947
Well, newsflash, Mazikeen.

17:58.990 --> 18:00.557

18:00.601 --> 18:01.602

the first time,

18:01.645 --> 18:02.646

18:07.695 --> 18:10.132
Right. Well, maybe
orange is the new Maze.

18:10.176 --> 18:11.699
Perhaps some time in the clink

for trying to control me.

18:13.875 --> 18:15.137

Right, well,

35:54.021 --> 35:56.806
And I don't know what
you're going through, Maze.

35:56.850 --> 35:59.853
I wish you would talk to me,
but, please,

35:59.896 --> 36:02.943
please put down the knife.

36:02.986 --> 36:04.727
Let me help you.

36:06.338 --> 36:09.167
Help?

36:09.210 --> 36:11.952
You're the reason
he won't take me home.

36:11.995 --> 36:13.910
What?

36:13.954 --> 36:15.651
You want a knife, Chloe?

36:15.695 --> 36:16.870
Maze!
[screams]

36:29.796 --> 36:31.189
Brother, are you sure?
I mean, the old you

36:31.232 --> 36:34.192
would never have
been okay with this.

36:34.235 --> 36:36.716
I don't think
we have much of a choice.

36:39.719 --> 36:41.416
LUCIFER:
Charlotte.

36:41.460 --> 36:43.331
Do you have a minute?

36:43.375 --> 36:45.681
Sure.

36:45.725 --> 36:49.859
Just getting ready to check
myself into the loony bin.

36:49.903 --> 36:52.340
Charlotte, listen.
I owe you an apology.

36:52.384 --> 36:55.822
I shouldn't have told you
what I did.

36:55.865 --> 36:59.260
Yes. And, well, I suppose

36:59.304 --> 37:01.871
that I didn't
help things either.

37:01.915 --> 37:03.830
So we are here to
make things right.

37:03.873 --> 37:05.701
Now, we can't undo
what we've already done,

37:05.745 --> 37:07.137
but maybe we can help you
move forward.

37:13.492 --> 37:15.711
Last chance to change
your mind, brother.

37:15.755 --> 37:18.410
Going once,
going twice...

37:20.847 --> 37:21.935
Fair enough.

37:21.978 --> 37:24.242
You, um, you may want
to sit down.

37:24.285 --> 37:28.028
Nah. At this point,
things can't get any crazier.

37:28.071 --> 37:30.726
[chuckles]
You'd think.

37:30.770 --> 37:32.859
[inhales]
Okay. [clears throat]

37:32.902 --> 37:34.904
[sighs]

37:44.174 --> 37:46.394
AMENADIEL:
Oh, no, Luci.

37:46.438 --> 37:47.743
We've broken her.

37:47.787 --> 37:49.832
Charlotte.

37:51.399 --> 37:53.749
Are you okay?

37:53.793 --> 37:55.795
[exhales]

37:57.884 --> 38:01.409
It's... it's real.

38:01.453 --> 38:04.282
[Charlotte crying]

38:06.196 --> 38:09.896
Then that means I'm...

38:09.939 --> 38:13.943
I'm not crazy. [laughs]

38:22.561 --> 38:24.171
Hey.

38:24.214 --> 38:26.434
Hey.

38:26.478 --> 38:29.916
I've, uh, I've been thinking
a lot about what you said.

38:29.959 --> 38:32.310
About Lucifer,
and, um...

38:32.353 --> 38:35.791
You know,
I need you to know that...

38:35.835 --> 38:39.055
he... he and I, we're...

38:39.099 --> 38:41.493
we're good partners,

38:41.536 --> 38:44.365
and... we're good friends.

38:44.409 --> 38:46.933
And I-- you know,
I don't want to lose that.

38:46.976 --> 38:48.195
It wasn't a fair ask.

38:48.238 --> 38:49.805
No. It's-it's...

38:49.849 --> 38:51.807
it's also unfair of me

38:51.851 --> 38:55.202
to ask you to deal
with this, you know?

39:05.517 --> 39:07.910
You want to take me home?

39:07.954 --> 39:09.999
I'll take you anywhere.

39:16.266 --> 39:19.139
It's okay. You don't
have to ride with me.

39:21.141 --> 39:24.144
I know. I want to.

39:32.892 --> 39:34.894
[engine starts]

39:46.427 --> 39:49.561
[pensive piano music plays]

39:57.438 --> 39:59.962
[Maze sighs]

40:00.006 --> 40:01.486
I'm here.
What do you want?

40:01.529 --> 40:04.271
To apologize.

40:04.314 --> 40:06.882
Look, I thought
you were manipulating me,

40:06.926 --> 40:09.058
but, well,

40:09.102 --> 40:11.409
I'm a big enough devil
to admit when I'm wrong.

40:12.932 --> 40:15.413
Anyway, killer caught.

40:15.456 --> 40:17.502
Demon exonerated.

40:17.545 --> 40:19.112
All good now?

40:19.155 --> 40:22.071
No.

40:22.115 --> 40:23.638
Everything that happened

40:23.682 --> 40:25.640
showed me exactly why
I need to go back.

40:25.684 --> 40:27.555
I don't understand.

40:27.599 --> 40:29.339
[sighs] It's all so

40:29.383 --> 40:31.559
complicated here, Lucifer.

40:31.603 --> 40:34.432
I mean, caring about humans
always goes wrong.

40:35.607 --> 40:37.217
Feelings suck.

40:38.348 --> 40:40.133
I am not the one who's supposed
to be tortured.

40:40.176 --> 40:42.178
You're the one who does
the torturing.

40:42.222 --> 40:43.963
Yes.

40:44.006 --> 40:46.226
So please, just...

40:46.269 --> 40:48.141
take me home.

40:48.184 --> 40:51.361
I can't. And not

40:51.405 --> 40:54.016
just 'cause of possible
repercussions with Dad.

40:54.060 --> 40:55.975
I... [sighs]

40:56.018 --> 40:57.672
I can't lose you,

40:57.716 --> 41:00.545
Maze.

41:00.588 --> 41:02.285
Not you, too.

41:02.329 --> 41:04.940
Oh.

41:04.984 --> 41:07.073
What do you mean,
"not me, too"?

41:07.116 --> 41:10.468
[scoffs] The detective.

41:10.511 --> 41:13.079
Right.I just saw her

41:13.122 --> 41:15.385
ride off with Pierce.

41:15.429 --> 41:17.344
She looked so happy.

41:18.998 --> 41:21.566
That's what I want, I suppose,
isn't it, her happiness?

41:24.003 --> 41:27.049
I just wish I knew that
Pierce's intentions were pure.

41:30.009 --> 41:33.534
Anyway, point is, you're right.

41:33.578 --> 41:37.233
Feelings and humans suck.

41:37.277 --> 41:39.366
So...

41:39.409 --> 41:42.282
at least we have each other.

41:44.110 --> 41:48.114
I'm always gonna be
the consolation prize for you.

41:48.157 --> 41:50.986
You only care about me

41:51.030 --> 41:53.511
when you don't have Chloe.

41:53.554 --> 41:56.209
Maze, now hold on. That's..No.

41:56.252 --> 41:59.995
[crying]:
No one puts me first.

42:00.039 --> 42:01.519

42:07.568 --> 42:11.137
