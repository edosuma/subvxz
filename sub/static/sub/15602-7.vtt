00:18.670 --> 00:21.870
<b>1x07- Reckoning</b>

00:22.671 --> 00:25.173
<i>Previously on "Green Lantern"...</i>

00:25.241 --> 00:30.145
<i>You belong to the Red Lantern corps.</i>

00:30.212 --> 00:32.113
How's that phony ring holding up?

00:32.180 --> 00:35.450
Without a Red Lantern battery,
eventually its charge will die.

00:35.518 --> 00:37.152
Sooner the better.

00:40.523 --> 00:42.023
Kilowog, get ready.

00:42.091 --> 00:46.060
Should be in view right... now.

00:47.163 --> 00:51.266
There it is...
Red Lantern mother ship.

00:51.333 --> 00:54.636
Aya, make sure we have max
resolution and magnification.

00:54.703 --> 00:58.139
Full spectrum scans. I want to
know everything about this rock.

01:07.116 --> 01:11.653
Yep, waste dump at 06:00
mean sola time, like clockwork.

01:13.956 --> 01:16.824
Congratulations.
After weeks of stalking Shard,

01:16.892 --> 01:20.061
you've unlocked the secret
of when they dump their garbage.

01:20.129 --> 01:22.397
Can total victory be far behind?

01:22.464 --> 01:26.167
I'm not hearing any better ideas
coming out of your talk hole, Red.

01:26.235 --> 01:28.136
Hold on.
We're repairing the ship

01:28.204 --> 01:30.838
so we can use the ultrawarp
and bring reinforcements from Oa.

01:30.906 --> 01:33.808
While we're waiting,
I'm gathering as much intel as I can

01:33.876 --> 01:36.010
without getting us killed
or letting the Red Lanterns know

01:36.078 --> 01:38.279
we didn't die when they
blew up that planet.

01:38.347 --> 01:41.015
Let me tell you
what Atrocitus would do.

01:41.083 --> 01:42.917
He'd come after you relentlessly.

01:42.985 --> 01:47.489
He'd keep coming until you were dead,
even if it meant his own death.

01:48.557 --> 01:51.226
I was a fool to join you.

01:51.293 --> 01:53.628
Soon I'll be as useless as you two.

01:53.696 --> 01:59.500
You have no chance of victory if you
aren't willing to die for your cause.

02:19.388 --> 02:24.492
- What are you doing?
- None of your business.

02:24.560 --> 02:28.096
Negative. You must have
permission to leave the interceptor.

02:28.163 --> 02:29.631
Explain yourself.

02:29.698 --> 02:32.100
I'm not a crew member.
I just quit.

02:32.167 --> 02:35.703
Technically, you are a prisoner.
Now please return to the ship.

02:35.771 --> 02:38.706
I do not want your actions to be
misunderstood by the others.

02:38.774 --> 02:42.543
- Heh. Misunderstood?
- I know you are not evil.

02:42.611 --> 02:45.613
Then you don't know me at all.

02:47.750 --> 02:50.451
You have forced me to alert
Green Lanterns Hal and Kilowog.

02:50.519 --> 02:52.086
They will help me bring you back.

02:52.154 --> 02:56.524
No, you'll all be busy saving the ship.

03:04.733 --> 03:06.734
I've got a quadruple failure
in the ultrawarp reactor.

03:06.802 --> 03:08.202
Is that even possible?

03:14.343 --> 03:16.611
We're not floating,
so we have internal gravity.

03:16.679 --> 03:20.148
I'm reading the boards right,
Jordan. And where's Aya?

03:20.215 --> 03:23.551
I am here. Scanning systems.

03:23.619 --> 03:27.155
Contrary to the readouts,
all functions are nominal to profile.

03:27.222 --> 03:30.958
Maybe she's right. Cycle the
rocker switches for a hard reboot.

03:36.231 --> 03:41.102
- So this was a... what?
- A diversion set by Razer.

03:41.170 --> 03:43.504
We fell for the oldest
trick in the book.

03:43.572 --> 03:45.707
Where's our little saboteur now?

03:45.774 --> 03:48.443
I'd like to congratulate him
on his success.

03:48.510 --> 03:51.579
He left the ship.
I do not know where he went.

03:51.647 --> 03:54.574
<i>Oh, I know exactly where he went...</i>

03:54.675 --> 03:56.017
<i>Shard.</i>

04:03.992 --> 04:06.047
Intruder! Seize him!

04:06.048 --> 04:09.130
Have you forgotten me so soon?

04:09.198 --> 04:12.734
Legion leader Razer?
But you're dead!

04:12.801 --> 04:17.338
We went to your memorial service.
You died a hero.

04:17.406 --> 04:21.274
Not yet...
but soon.

04:24.279 --> 04:26.381
Lord Atrocitus, Razer is back.

04:26.448 --> 04:29.817
<i>He's at battery square.
He's about to recharge his ring.</i>

04:29.885 --> 04:35.089
Zilius, prepare a proper
welcome for our Razer.

04:42.898 --> 04:46.200
With blood and rage
of crimson red,

04:46.268 --> 04:49.070
we fill men's souls
with darkest dread

04:49.138 --> 04:51.672
and twist your minds
to pain and hate.

04:51.740 --> 04:55.276
We'll burn you all.
That is your fate.

04:59.648 --> 05:04.454
Ah, a lost son has returned to me.

05:04.520 --> 05:06.654
I have.

05:10.502 --> 05:13.136
I was captured by the Green Lanterns.

05:13.204 --> 05:15.806
But it was only a matter of time
before I gained their trust.

05:15.874 --> 05:18.575
Then I blew up their ship.

05:18.643 --> 05:21.011
You did well, Razer.

05:22.380 --> 05:27.317
I could only think of being here...
by your side.

05:28.953 --> 05:32.055
To do this!

05:43.668 --> 05:48.472
Did you really think I'd allow
you to recharge your power ring

05:48.539 --> 05:51.742
without finding out
your true intentions?

05:51.809 --> 05:55.579
What you received
was a mere light show.

05:55.646 --> 06:01.852
Now tell me, what have you
really been doing all this time?

06:04.956 --> 06:07.491
See? I told you
he was a lost cause.

06:07.558 --> 06:09.326
And I say good riddance.

06:09.393 --> 06:12.062
Who knows? Maybe he was
planning this the whole time!

06:12.130 --> 06:15.732
If that were true, why didn't he
just kill us when he had the chance?

06:17.401 --> 06:21.004
Instead, he took the time
to create a very convincing diversion.

06:21.072 --> 06:24.241
Agreed. The program
is nearly undetectable.

06:24.308 --> 06:27.277
My subsystems are studying
how it works even now.

06:27.345 --> 06:29.746
My bet is he went to settle
his score with Atrocitus.

06:29.814 --> 06:32.075
Then he should have made
funeral arrangements,

06:32.076 --> 06:33.583
'cause that's a one -way ticket.

06:33.651 --> 06:37.354
And he knows it, which is
why we have to stop him.

06:43.361 --> 06:48.465
Of all your stupid ideas,
Jordan, this one wins the prize!

06:50.902 --> 06:55.939
If you trust no one, Razer,
you're never disappointed.

06:58.075 --> 07:01.278
Master, I can't believe you're
bringing out your personal battery

07:01.345 --> 07:05.282
to power his interrogation.
He doesn't deserve this.

07:05.349 --> 07:07.951
Elements of your story are true.

07:08.019 --> 07:10.587
You have been with
the Green Lanterns.

07:10.655 --> 07:12.389
And by the end of our talk,

07:12.456 --> 07:15.892
you'll tell me everything
you know about them.

07:15.960 --> 07:18.762
Now, let's begin.

07:18.830 --> 07:24.267
This could go quick or slow,
but I really hope you choose slow.

07:42.954 --> 07:45.856
They're shooting
at the asteroids, Jordan.

08:16.687 --> 08:20.490
No. No more.
I'll talk.

08:20.558 --> 08:24.027
See? A matter of time.
Speak up.

08:33.537 --> 08:37.340
I'm going to miss you, Razer.

08:37.408 --> 08:41.945
Schedule his execution.
We'll make an example of this one.

09:00.698 --> 09:03.667
Aya, do you remember the plan?
You won't forget anything?

09:03.734 --> 09:06.436
I am less likely to forget
than you, Green Lantern Hal.

09:06.504 --> 09:09.873
- How's she gonna get in?
- With ease.

09:13.511 --> 09:17.314
- I forgot she could do that.
- Patrol.

09:18.950 --> 09:20.483
Come on.

09:39.270 --> 09:42.672
<i>It is by hate alone
I set my will in motion.</i>

09:42.740 --> 09:46.276
<i>It is through the breath of rage
that vengeance is made manifest.</i>

09:48.746 --> 09:51.214
<i>For Wrath only do I live and die.</i>

09:51.282 --> 09:54.617
All hail...
who's there?

09:56.153 --> 09:57.988
I warn you,
I can defend myself.

09:58.055 --> 10:00.490
You hide.
I'll stall.

10:02.126 --> 10:04.060
What are you doing here
in the middle of the night?

10:04.128 --> 10:05.996
Official business. Sorry, sir.

10:06.063 --> 10:09.866
Do I look like a "sir" to you?
I'm cleric Loran.

10:09.934 --> 10:12.902
Lucky for you,
soldiers are always welcome

10:12.970 --> 10:15.772
in the house of our lord Atrocitus.

10:20.011 --> 10:24.214
Cleric Loran, it's been a
long time since I've been here.

10:24.281 --> 10:28.685
I'd love to hear the story behind
these beautiful stained-glass windows.

10:28.753 --> 10:31.488
Of course, my angry child.

10:33.691 --> 10:38.261
The city represents the capital of
Ysmault before the guardians arrived,

10:38.329 --> 10:43.166
but it would be any city on a thousand
worlds in our now-ravaged galaxy.

10:43.234 --> 10:47.037
And then the guardians
descended upon us.

10:47.104 --> 10:50.073
They said they would bring
peace and order,

10:50.141 --> 10:54.677
but as the book of rage tells us,
lies tumbled from their mouths.

10:54.745 --> 10:57.881
They said, "kneel before us,
and you will want for nothing. "

10:57.948 --> 11:00.517
but we would not worship them,

11:00.584 --> 11:02.886
and their wrath was
deep and terrible.

11:02.953 --> 11:06.222
The blue devils unleashed
their automaton manhunters,

11:06.290 --> 11:10.293
and the guardians' soulless
avengers snuffed out every life,

11:10.361 --> 11:14.731
stealing every breath
and stilling every heart.

11:14.799 --> 11:19.302
It was his holy hate that bore
the first fruit of a Red Lantern,

11:19.370 --> 11:23.540
he, our lord Atrocitus
of the five inversions.

11:23.607 --> 11:26.309
So, by Red Lantern's light,

11:26.377 --> 11:29.779
we shall bring vengeance
to those who laid us low.

11:33.284 --> 11:35.118
Just what do you think
you're doing?

11:35.186 --> 11:38.621
Does this look like your mess hall
to slam my door like that?

11:38.689 --> 11:40.490
Have you no respect?

11:40.558 --> 11:43.860
<i>Pardon, cleric. We're
searching for two missing gunners.</i>

11:43.928 --> 11:48.131
I'll sweep here, men.
You go down the street.

11:51.969 --> 11:53.553
Hold your fire.

11:53.554 --> 11:57.140
- Do you trust me?
- Uh...

12:00.377 --> 12:03.346
Remember this lesson well.

12:03.414 --> 12:07.951
This is what happens to those
who stray from my righteous path.

12:08.018 --> 12:12.355
- Zilius, proceed.
- This might sting a bit.

12:13.824 --> 12:15.925
Who dares?

12:19.196 --> 12:22.665
I just caught this stinking
Green Lantern in your shrine.

12:26.704 --> 12:29.005
Oh, boy.

12:33.232 --> 12:36.500
So, it seems Razer wasn't the only one

12:36.568 --> 12:39.570
to survive the explosion
of Colony 12.

12:39.638 --> 12:43.908
You Green Lanterns are harder
to kill than I thought.

12:43.976 --> 12:47.812
Uh, master? Permission
to cut off Razer's head?

12:47.880 --> 12:51.649
What's your name, soldier?
Uh, Wrath, my lord.

12:51.717 --> 12:53.918
You can execute
the one you caught

12:53.986 --> 12:57.488
at the same time
Razer meets his doom.

13:01.326 --> 13:04.061
Let's get started.

13:07.232 --> 13:10.268
Death to all enemies of Atrocitus.

13:10.335 --> 13:11.936
Aya, now!

13:13.472 --> 13:15.206
<i>Warning,
power controls overloading.</i>

13:15.274 --> 13:17.942
<i>Retreat to interior
safe zone immediately.</i>

13:22.414 --> 13:25.383
You were foolish to come!
I made my intentions clear!

13:25.450 --> 13:27.285
Do you even have a plan
to get out of here?

13:27.352 --> 13:29.654
Don't need one.
And you're coming with us.

13:29.721 --> 13:33.457
They've infected our reactor
with a virus.

13:33.525 --> 13:36.594
It's a trick, you buffoon.

13:39.531 --> 13:41.666
You!

13:55.514 --> 13:57.648
With blood and rage
of crimson red,

13:57.716 --> 14:00.584
we fill men's souls
with darkest dread

14:00.652 --> 14:03.321
and twist your minds
to pain and hate.

14:03.388 --> 14:06.791
we'll burn you all.
That is your fate!

14:27.579 --> 14:29.246
I know you'd willingly die today,

14:29.314 --> 14:31.449
but do you have the strength
to live for a cause?

14:31.516 --> 14:34.385
Because we sure could
use you right now.

14:37.155 --> 14:40.257
Aya, we are go.
Table for 3.

14:44.329 --> 14:48.666
Finish them.
I don't want prisoners.

14:48.734 --> 14:52.003
I have shut down Shard's
automated defenses

14:52.070 --> 14:54.271
to allow the interceptor
to pass through.

14:54.339 --> 14:58.209
Estimating arrival at docking bay 22
in 8 minutes and 40 seconds.

14:58.276 --> 14:59.877
Good. Meet us there.

14:59.945 --> 15:03.447
My own arrival may be delayed.
I am currently downloading a large file.

15:03.515 --> 15:06.350
<i>Don't be late for dinner, baby.
Over and out.</i>

15:24.636 --> 15:29.040
Ok, I've had about
enough of you posers!

16:13.785 --> 16:15.586
Everything's spinning.

16:15.654 --> 16:19.090
Aya, ETA 30 seconds.
Where are you?

16:19.157 --> 16:23.327
<i>Your plan didn't work,
guardian lapdog.</i>

16:23.395 --> 16:26.614
<i>If you'd like to reclaim your toy,</i>

16:26.615 --> 16:29.834
<i>meet me at battery square.</i>

16:31.970 --> 16:33.838
- It's a trap.
- Of course it is.

16:33.905 --> 16:35.473
But we don't leave anyone behind.

16:35.540 --> 16:38.375
I'll get the comp...
Aya, I'll get her.

16:38.443 --> 16:40.444
Not alone, you won't.

16:40.512 --> 16:43.247
You've got to get the sergeant
to safety and prep the ship for takeoff.

16:43.315 --> 16:46.550
We won't get away from a dozen
Red Lanterns with only ring power.

16:46.618 --> 16:48.385
We need that ship.

16:48.453 --> 16:51.222
Too risky. We board the ship
now, and then I'll find Aya.

16:51.289 --> 16:53.157
By then it will be too late!

16:53.225 --> 16:55.626
You're always going on about
having the courage not to fight,

16:55.694 --> 16:58.562
so do you have the courage
to leave this to me?

17:00.699 --> 17:04.635
I'm trusting you to bring back
a member of my crew, Razer.

17:04.703 --> 17:07.238
Don't make me regret it.

17:26.090 --> 17:29.927
- Leave her alone.
- You want her?

17:29.995 --> 17:32.830
Anything for you.

17:41.673 --> 17:44.074
I hoped you would choose wisely.

17:44.142 --> 17:47.645
I hoped you'd be
an ambassador for my legacy.

17:47.712 --> 17:50.247
A legacy of murder and hate.

18:28.253 --> 18:31.388
I had such high ambitions
when I created you.

18:35.193 --> 18:39.697
You didn't create me, I did.
If only I had listened to...

18:39.764 --> 18:44.301
If only you had listened
to your sad little farm girl?

18:51.610 --> 18:54.245
Do you think what she said to you,
what you felt for her,

18:54.312 --> 18:56.480
mattered in the least?

18:56.548 --> 18:59.116
It was I who conquered
your world,

18:59.184 --> 19:01.919
who set your warlords
against each other

19:01.987 --> 19:05.723
to create destruction
and chaos and hate!

19:07.626 --> 19:11.228
It was I who saw your
potential and recruited you.

19:11.296 --> 19:14.331
And when I saw
you needed only a nudge

19:14.399 --> 19:17.568
to become a truly hateful creature,

19:17.636 --> 19:20.404
then I sealed your fate.

19:20.472 --> 19:25.175
It was I who slaughtered
your precious Elana.

19:39.224 --> 19:42.626
<i>Razer, we have to get
to the interceptor.</i>

19:42.694 --> 19:44.595
<i>I have vital information
for Hal Jordan,</i>

19:44.663 --> 19:48.098
<i>but my mobility has been impeded.
Will you aid me?</i>

19:48.166 --> 19:50.609
No. Do the best you can.

19:52.625 --> 19:54.705
You die now.

19:57.876 --> 20:00.978
<i>If we do not leave now,
we will all die.</i>

20:43.722 --> 20:45.389
Aya, are you all right?

20:45.457 --> 20:48.792
I am fine. Although my repairs
shall take some time,

20:48.860 --> 20:51.028
that is inconsequential.

20:52.931 --> 20:55.499
Your actions put us all in danger.

20:55.567 --> 20:58.902
Atrocitus knows we're alive now,
and he'll be looking for us.

20:58.970 --> 21:01.438
Our job just got infinitely
harder thanks to you.

21:03.475 --> 21:06.009
Attention,
I have unlocked the encryption

21:06.077 --> 21:10.214
on the files I stole from
the Red Lantern mainframe.

21:14.386 --> 21:17.321
Warships, hundreds of them.

21:17.389 --> 21:20.023
Better keep your ring charged, Red.

21:20.091 --> 21:22.759
Looks like we all should.

21:23.180 --> 21:24.760
