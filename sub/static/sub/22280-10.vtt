00:07.000 --> 00:09.400
NARRATOR: On this episode
of Life Below Zero,

00:09.433 --> 00:13.033
as winter nears its end,
new obstacles arise.

00:13.067 --> 00:16.400
SUE: In the end, I'm not the
one with control out here,
Mother Nature is.

00:16.433 --> 00:19.133
NARRATOR: The Hailstones' hunt
takes a turn for the worse.

00:19.167 --> 00:22.433
AGNES: There's a fox
over there, I'm gonna
take a shot. Fuck!

00:22.467 --> 00:25.800
NARRATOR: Andy stalks
a lethal predator
to protect his livelihood.

00:25.833 --> 00:28.433
I got multiple wolf tracks
in this slough here.

00:28.467 --> 00:31.533
NARRATOR: Erik and
Martha's plans
come to a screeching halt.

00:31.567 --> 00:32.633
It's not gonna happen.

00:32.667 --> 00:34.433
NARRATOR: And Sue
races to clear a path.

00:34.467 --> 00:37.600
SUE: A plane must have
a runway to safely land.

00:57.600 --> 00:58.633
There we go.

00:58.667 --> 01:00.200
We're gonna cut up
this moose quarter.

01:00.233 --> 01:03.033
It's the last one that we have
from the moose we harvested
this past fall.

01:03.067 --> 01:05.967
It's a ham, really tasty,
prime cut piece.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.233
I'll hack the bone
out of here.

01:08.267 --> 01:11.233
Start taking apart
the muscle groups.

01:11.267 --> 01:13.100
When we kill a moose
or kill a caribou,

01:13.133 --> 01:15.833
the bones are full
of marrow and they're
really great for soup,

01:15.867 --> 01:18.133
and then, you know,
animals like moose or caribou,

01:18.167 --> 01:20.833
where the hide
isn't worth anything,
we use that for trapping bait.

01:20.867 --> 01:23.467
And there's really
something to do with most
parts of any animal.

01:25.800 --> 01:30.333
NARRATOR: Erik
and Martha Salitan
rely on the animals they hunt

01:30.367 --> 01:33.433
to maintain a subsistence
lifestyle in the Arctic.

01:35.000 --> 01:38.167
You wanna scrap together
a smoker and smoke
some of this meat?

01:38.200 --> 01:40.433
Yeah, that could
be fun, different.

01:40.467 --> 01:43.867
-Break up the cuisine
a little bit?
-Mmm-hmm.

01:45.967 --> 01:48.133
Harvesting your own meat,
it's very fulfilling.

01:48.167 --> 01:51.900
You feel a lot better knowing
that you butchered the animal,

01:51.933 --> 01:53.367
it's all good quality meat,

01:53.400 --> 01:57.133
and makes you feel
a little bit more independent
living in the bush.

01:57.167 --> 02:01.000
Well, I'm done. Let's go out
and check out what we got
for building materials.

02:01.033 --> 02:03.400
Sounds good. I'm done, too.

02:03.433 --> 02:06.167
I'll go put this outside
where it'll be cold.

02:06.200 --> 02:08.733
MARTHA: So Erik and I
just got done
butchering the moose.

02:08.767 --> 02:11.400
We're gonna go out
to the hangar and hopefully
find the materials

02:11.433 --> 02:14.600
that we need to put together
a, uh, usable smoker.

02:19.833 --> 02:23.533
ERIK: The type of smoker
that we're looking to make
is a cold smoker.

02:23.567 --> 02:25.133
It just adds a little bit
more flavour.

02:25.167 --> 02:27.067
It doesn't add
any nutritional value.

02:27.100 --> 02:28.700
It has nothing to do
with life or death,

02:28.733 --> 02:31.033
it's just a little
spice of life.

02:31.067 --> 02:34.433
Doing these small kind
of projects is fun 'cause
it's like a change of pace,

02:34.467 --> 02:37.133
something different
than the daily chores.

02:37.167 --> 02:39.367
It's nice to be able
to build something yourself

02:39.400 --> 02:41.867
and to be able to also take
the meat that you've harvested

02:41.900 --> 02:45.567
and throw it in there
and make an edible,
finished product.

02:45.600 --> 02:47.233
ERIK: I'm gonna use
these 2 x 6s

02:47.267 --> 02:50.400
that are left over
from building this hangar
this past summer.

02:50.433 --> 02:54.133
We're gonna go six feet deep,
six feet wide, and put
a six-foot roof on there.

02:54.167 --> 02:56.067
MARTHA: Now we just got
one more wall to go,

02:56.100 --> 02:58.200
which is the wall that's gonna
have the door in it.

02:58.233 --> 03:00.400
Then we're gonna
throw on the sheeting.

03:00.433 --> 03:02.467
We got a lot of work
ahead of us.

03:04.433 --> 03:06.233
ANDY: We give up a lot
to live out here

03:06.267 --> 03:09.200
because we want a certain type
of quality of life.

03:09.233 --> 03:11.567
And a big part
of that quality of life

03:11.600 --> 03:14.567
is utilising the resources
that are here for us.

03:26.433 --> 03:28.933
I'm preparing right now
to start making

03:28.967 --> 03:33.067
a bunch of snares
for predator trapping.

03:33.100 --> 03:37.767
And, um, we don't have
a lot of moose
per square mile here.

03:37.800 --> 03:41.500
Part of that problem
is because of predators,
uh, namely, wolves.

03:41.533 --> 03:45.367
Any kind of predator control
is very emotional
for a lot of people.

03:45.400 --> 03:47.267
Most people are either
for it or against it.

03:47.300 --> 03:50.067
There's very few people
that are middle ground.

03:50.100 --> 03:52.467
Um, I tend to be kind of
middle ground on it, though,

03:52.500 --> 03:54.233
because I realise,

03:54.267 --> 03:57.333
as much as I don't
like killing animals,

03:57.367 --> 04:01.200
um, it's absolutely necessary
if I want to be able
to eat in the future.

04:02.567 --> 04:04.667
I'm getting older,
and so I want to make sure

04:04.700 --> 04:07.233
that there's a good
moose population in my area

04:07.267 --> 04:10.233
so that I don't have
to work so hard
to feed myself every year.

04:14.033 --> 04:17.533
For me, going a year without
a moose is really bad.

04:19.567 --> 04:23.167
That's probably the equivalent
of someone's house
burning down,

04:23.200 --> 04:25.567
losing their job,
and their car explodes.

04:25.600 --> 04:28.267
Your world is gone
if you don't have
moose or caribou

04:28.300 --> 04:29.633
in the freezer for the winter.

04:30.767 --> 04:32.567
I've now made my loop.

04:32.600 --> 04:34.333
I like to make
my loops pretty big.

04:34.367 --> 04:37.433
Uh, the wolves,
they don't like going
through something small,

04:37.467 --> 04:40.033
so I tend to make
my loops fairly big.

04:40.067 --> 04:41.733
Uh, and when
the animal goes in,

04:41.767 --> 04:45.867
this slides very easily
in one direction, here.

04:45.900 --> 04:47.900
And then,
once it tightens down,

04:47.933 --> 04:51.067
it's very difficult
to get it to unlock.

04:51.100 --> 04:53.000
It's pretty simple method
to make these.

04:53.033 --> 04:55.333
Not too terribly expensive

04:55.367 --> 04:58.833
and, um,
can be very efficient.

05:02.667 --> 05:06.000
Wolves are probably
the single hardest thing
to trap or snare up here.

05:06.033 --> 05:07.500
They're incredibly smart.

05:07.533 --> 05:09.000
They have an incredible
sense of smell,

05:09.033 --> 05:12.833
so they can smell steel
underneath the snow
or hanging in the woods.

05:12.867 --> 05:15.000
This year,
when I killed my moose,
I saved the hide,

05:15.033 --> 05:20.433
I saved the head,
but I also saved all the guts
and I put them in a tote.

05:20.467 --> 05:23.867
They've been sitting in a tote
all fall and into the winter.

05:23.900 --> 05:26.900
Ooh, yeah.

05:26.933 --> 05:28.167
Smells ripe.

05:28.200 --> 05:30.267
These wolves
are going after moose,

05:30.300 --> 05:33.467
so I think the moose guts
is probably gonna
be my best bet.

05:35.133 --> 05:37.367
And that'll be my main bait.

05:37.400 --> 05:40.700
Got some moose guts for bait.

05:40.733 --> 05:43.200
I got holes in them
so I can tie them
up to a tree.

05:43.233 --> 05:47.367
The one thing I don't have
is I don't have
much daylight left.

05:47.400 --> 05:50.633
It's pretty much gone
off the mountain here now,

05:50.667 --> 05:52.333
which means I got
about an hour or so.

05:52.367 --> 05:54.867
That's not enough time to get
out and make these sets.

05:57.100 --> 05:59.200
It's a one-shot deal
when you do this

05:59.233 --> 06:01.300
and we'll get an early start
tomorrow morning.

06:04.033 --> 06:06.567
SUE: I did not choose
to leave society.

06:06.600 --> 06:09.267
I am just living my own life.

06:09.300 --> 06:13.333
Only with the freedom
of isolation
does my little light shine.

06:21.567 --> 06:24.400
I've got a snow machine coming
out to help me with my chores.

06:24.433 --> 06:26.700
(COUGHS) Snow machine won't
fit into a regular plane.

06:26.733 --> 06:28.567
It's gotta be a bigger plane.

06:28.600 --> 06:31.733
And, uh, there's a Caravan,

06:31.767 --> 06:34.800
a little bit larger plane
than I usually get
during the winter.

06:34.833 --> 06:39.100
But the key to getting
the Caravan in was getting
the runway ready for it.

06:39.133 --> 06:43.433
NARRATOR: Sue Aikens
relies on planes to deliver
supplies into Kavik.

06:43.467 --> 06:45.367
Maintaining her
mile-and-a-half runway

06:45.400 --> 06:49.267
is crucial for her survival
and can take days to complete.

06:50.600 --> 06:53.200
SUE: If a big plane tries
to land, you know,

06:53.233 --> 06:57.400
going 200 miles an hour
and tries to land on ice,
on sheet ice, glare ice,

06:57.433 --> 07:00.800
all's they're gonna do is be
a new storage unit
off the end of my runway.

07:00.833 --> 07:04.100
Gonna go work on the runway,
try to get as much snow
off of it as I can.

07:04.133 --> 07:07.500
I'm hoping if I can get
the initial layer of snow
off down to the ice,

07:07.533 --> 07:09.933
the sun will do the rest
of the work for me.

07:09.967 --> 07:12.233
If I can't do that,
I can't get the Caravan in.

07:12.267 --> 07:14.167
Can't get the Caravan in,

07:14.200 --> 07:16.400
well, then somebody
in Deadhorse gets
my snow machine

07:16.433 --> 07:18.567
as a lawn decoration.
(CHUCKLES)

07:24.500 --> 07:28.367
I don't take the clearing
or the maintaining
of the runway lightly at all.

07:28.400 --> 07:31.900
Most of these bush pilots
and pilots that come out here
are people that I know.

07:31.933 --> 07:34.233
They're cool people.

07:34.267 --> 07:37.800
A plane must have
a decent runway

07:37.833 --> 07:40.700
that they can count on
to safely land.

07:40.733 --> 07:44.233
Doesn't matter how badly
I want to get
whatever's on that plane.

07:44.267 --> 07:47.967
I will never risk
somebody's life to get it.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.733
I take that very seriously.

07:52.167 --> 07:53.900
I'm gonna go ahead
and drag this section.

07:53.933 --> 07:57.033
Gonna attach my drag,
that's this thing
under the snow.

07:57.067 --> 08:00.467
And it's gonna cut and move
the top layer of snow.

08:00.500 --> 08:02.000
Right now it may seem light,

08:02.033 --> 08:03.900
but this is after
10:00 at night,

08:03.933 --> 08:06.100
so my temperatures are gonna
go down a little bit.

08:06.133 --> 08:07.733
Um, before
everything refreezes,

08:07.767 --> 08:10.733
I wanna knock that clear
and let the sun
work on it tomorrow.

08:19.867 --> 08:21.467
I heard the engine knocking.

08:21.500 --> 08:24.267
If I keep pushing it
and it breaks down
on the runway,

08:24.300 --> 08:27.133
then I've shut down
my entire runway
to even skied landings.

08:30.467 --> 08:33.767
I had to take a drag off this,
she's done.

08:33.800 --> 08:37.633
I have to get her in the shop,
let it warm up,
take a look at it tomorrow.

08:39.433 --> 08:41.533
If I can't get this thing
going tomorrow,

08:41.567 --> 08:45.033
I don't get a snow machine
in a Caravan,
that's the way that is.

08:47.067 --> 08:50.467
AGNES: In this harsh country,
there's nobody just gonna
appear and help you.

08:50.500 --> 08:53.733
You have to be comfortable
and have an idea
of what you're doing

08:53.767 --> 08:57.167
before you just decide
to just get up
and go out into the country.

09:11.067 --> 09:12.867
Is it cold out, Chip?

09:12.900 --> 09:14.567
CHIP: It's getting
a little breezy,

09:14.600 --> 09:16.367
so I would dress warm
if I were you.

09:16.400 --> 09:18.933
NARRATOR: Chip and Agnes
have set up camp in Kiwalik,

09:18.967 --> 09:21.467
110 miles from their home
in Noorvik,

09:21.500 --> 09:25.200
to capitalise on the region's
vast resources
of caribou and fur.

09:25.233 --> 09:27.167
CHIP: We've had terrible winds
and terrible weather

09:27.200 --> 09:29.500
and in the time that we've had
to wait for the weather,

09:29.533 --> 09:31.600
the caribou have gotten
closer and closer.

09:31.633 --> 09:32.733
Now the caribou are here.

09:32.767 --> 09:35.533
-Whoa, bright.
-Yeah, it is bright.

09:35.567 --> 09:38.367
There should be a small herd
of caribou roaming around,

09:38.400 --> 09:40.833
so we're just gonna
go check out the flats
and the lower hills

09:40.867 --> 09:42.533
and, uh, see
what we've come across.

09:42.567 --> 09:46.367
After three, four days,
we pretty much consumed
all our extra food we brought,

09:46.400 --> 09:48.567
so we just need camp meat.

09:48.600 --> 09:51.767
I'll bet you the caribou
are closer
than they were yesterday.

09:51.800 --> 09:54.833
CHIP: One thing that's nice
is the caribou are moving
closer to camp every day.

09:54.867 --> 09:59.067
Caribou are herd animals.
They all wanna be together.
They wanna be in large groups.

09:59.100 --> 10:00.967
So they're forming up right
now and they're forming up,

10:01.000 --> 10:02.233
and they're following
each other,

10:02.267 --> 10:04.533
and they're gonna be
passing through here.

10:04.567 --> 10:05.833
Our good days are here.

10:09.533 --> 10:11.467
CHIP: Yeah, no, let's head up
to the, to the, um, trail

10:11.500 --> 10:12.600
-and take the hard trail.
-The trail.

10:12.633 --> 10:15.233
And we'll save gas that way.

10:15.267 --> 10:18.500
The best thing we can do here,
because we wanna hunt
in a short distance

10:18.533 --> 10:20.033
and because we wanna
have an easier hunt

10:20.067 --> 10:22.000
is to let the animals
come to us.

10:22.033 --> 10:25.500
So when we got the animals
coming closer and closer,
it saves us gas,

10:25.533 --> 10:28.700
it saves us parts,
it saves us time,
it saves us a lot of energy.

10:32.233 --> 10:35.900
AGNES: Pretty much gonna stay
down low where it's not
too windy, not too cold.

10:35.933 --> 10:39.633
We just go ride round through
the back and watch the herd

10:39.667 --> 10:42.800
and see if there's any fur
or anything else around.

10:45.700 --> 10:48.833
There's a fox over there!
I'm gonna get closer
and take a shot!

10:57.233 --> 10:58.300
Fuck!

11:03.200 --> 11:05.233
There goes my ride.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.600
I let go of my handlebar.

11:08.633 --> 11:14.867
I sit up, and I grab my rifle,
and it got stuck
in my handlebar.

11:16.133 --> 11:18.267
And then it turned me.

11:19.333 --> 11:20.667
Fuck!

11:21.533 --> 11:25.033
Oh, God, over
a stupid fucking fox.

11:27.000 --> 11:28.867
CHIP: Wow,
I didn't see you crash.

11:28.900 --> 11:31.067
If I saw her standing there,
and I saw the fox running,

11:31.100 --> 11:33.167
and I didn't see her aiming
or trying to shoot at it.

11:33.800 --> 11:35.633
-Are you okay?
-No.

11:37.467 --> 11:40.333
Well, the rifle went right
through the fucking, uh...

11:41.733 --> 11:43.300
Right through the tank.

11:43.333 --> 11:46.233
(EXHALES) Well, you know,
here on the tundra,
it's bumpy.

11:46.267 --> 11:49.200
And if you go too fast
and you hit too big of a bump,
you can get thrown off,

11:49.233 --> 11:53.633
you get your machine
flipped over, you can get,
um, you can just crash.

11:53.667 --> 11:56.933
As long as you're okay,
I can fix this.

11:56.967 --> 11:58.233
Okay?

11:58.267 --> 12:00.467
AGNES: Fucking,
stupid fucking fox.

12:00.500 --> 12:02.567
CHIP: You could sit here
and cry, and hoo
and ha over this shit.

12:02.600 --> 12:04.667
It doesn't fix plastic
or metal.

12:04.700 --> 12:09.067
We need to get it back to camp
so we can put it on a cargo
sled and take it home.

12:09.100 --> 12:13.000
Or we need to, um, leave
it the fuck here and just
carry on with ourselves.

12:13.033 --> 12:15.033
We need to go get
you another rifle.

12:17.900 --> 12:20.133
AGNES: Oh, God, it's...

12:20.167 --> 12:22.067
Fuck!

12:22.100 --> 12:23.833
Bent.

12:23.867 --> 12:25.333
Broken.

12:25.367 --> 12:29.500
Not only did I break
my best rifle,

12:29.533 --> 12:32.300
I totally broke my gas tank.

12:32.333 --> 12:34.367
Handlebars won't even turn.

12:34.400 --> 12:37.933
My windshield is all smashed
up into many pieces.

12:37.967 --> 12:39.867
CHIP: There's a lot
of structural damage
to this thing.

12:39.900 --> 12:42.000
-It's not a pretty sight.
-Sorry about that.

12:42.033 --> 12:44.500
It's not you,
I'm glad you're okay.

12:44.533 --> 12:46.067
Don't be sorry to me.

12:46.100 --> 12:48.933
I've crashed snow machines,
I know just exactly
how you're feeling.

12:48.967 --> 12:51.833
We still got one ride,
there's no reason to go back
unless my ride's totalled,

12:51.867 --> 12:54.300
and then we've got yours
for parts and we'll still
make it home.

12:54.333 --> 12:56.300
-Okay. Well, that's
a good way...
-So buck up.

12:56.333 --> 12:58.500
-...to look at it.
-It'll be all good, yeah.
We're gonna be good.

12:58.533 --> 13:00.067
-Get ready?
-Yeah, put your stuff on it

13:00.100 --> 13:01.967
and let's just tow this thing
back to camp now.

13:02.000 --> 13:04.100
Having two machines
has always been our premise.

13:04.133 --> 13:06.967
When one machine's down,
we can continue on
while we fix the other one.

13:07.000 --> 13:08.633
I think you gotta just
quit worrying about it.

13:08.667 --> 13:12.167
We've always, always,
always figured it out.

13:20.800 --> 13:24.833
MARTHA: As far as waste goes,
I guess that comes full circle
with everything that we have.

13:24.867 --> 13:28.300
Whatever we can use,
we'll utilise it,
so, nothing goes to waste.

13:44.000 --> 13:46.267
ERIK: Working on my skid here,
drilling a hole in.

13:46.300 --> 13:47.933
I'm gonna attach a rope
between the two of them

13:47.967 --> 13:51.100
and then I'm gonna be able
to pull the smokehouse
around with a truck,

13:51.133 --> 13:53.700
a four-wheeler,
a snow machine,
a tractor, whatever.

13:53.733 --> 13:55.000
NARRATOR: In Wiseman,

13:55.033 --> 13:58.000
Erik and Martha are using
resources that surround them

13:58.033 --> 14:00.533
as well as salvage materials
from past builds

14:00.567 --> 14:03.100
for the construction
of a new smokehouse.

14:04.533 --> 14:06.400
MARTHA: We're putting up
the sheet metal here,

14:06.433 --> 14:10.833
which is not only going
to complete the smokehouse,
but make it sturdier.

14:10.867 --> 14:12.933
Feed it up on the top there.

14:12.967 --> 14:15.033
MARTHA: So far progress
has been real fast.

14:15.067 --> 14:17.267
We have four walls,
we've got the roofs all ready.

14:17.300 --> 14:19.933
We've pounded it out
and we're just gonna
keep moving.

14:19.967 --> 14:23.200
Is it gonna fit?

14:23.233 --> 14:26.300
We're gonna get this door
on hinges, make sure it flows
the way we want it.

14:26.333 --> 14:28.433
Then we'll sheet
the son of a gun.

14:28.467 --> 14:30.233
MARTHA: Between our
fishing lodge in Iliamna

14:30.267 --> 14:32.000
and our hunting lodge up here
in the Brooks Range,

14:32.033 --> 14:33.400
we've always got
a lot going on.

14:33.433 --> 14:36.500
So it's nice to be able
to work on our own
little projects

14:36.533 --> 14:38.967
at our own pace
and do what we wanna do.

14:43.000 --> 14:44.333
ERIK: It's gotta come up
a touch more.

14:44.367 --> 14:46.367
Yup, right there.

14:49.600 --> 14:50.633
(DRILLING)

14:55.467 --> 14:57.700
Nice.

14:57.733 --> 14:59.700
-And it's solid.
-Yeah.

14:59.733 --> 15:03.433
And the first moose we smoke
in there is the moose
that antlers it is.

15:03.467 --> 15:07.500
I'm just pumped to drag it
out of here and, uh, fire
it up for the first time.

15:10.700 --> 15:13.133
ANDY: Everything changes
in the wintertime up here.

15:13.167 --> 15:14.433
Everything gets harder.

15:14.467 --> 15:16.033
You have to be
twice as careful.

15:16.067 --> 15:17.733
You don't take chances.

15:17.767 --> 15:20.967
If you do have a problem,
you don't have
a lot of time to react.

15:27.500 --> 15:29.267
(BARKING)

15:31.267 --> 15:32.767
This is gonna be bait
for wolves.

15:32.800 --> 15:39.100
This is moose guts,
left over from the
moose that I got this fall.

15:50.467 --> 15:53.033
I think that's about
all we need for supplies.

15:53.067 --> 15:56.867
I'm hoping that I can set
a bunch of bait out
and, uh, hopefully trap

15:56.900 --> 15:58.900
a few of those wolves
in this area.

15:58.933 --> 16:00.767
(HOWLING)

16:03.567 --> 16:07.467
I'm really dependent
on the resources
that are around here.

16:07.500 --> 16:09.867
The moose population,
the density is so low,

16:09.900 --> 16:13.500
that's creating a real problem
with competition.

16:13.533 --> 16:15.367
Good boy, Briggus!
Good boy, Berg!

16:15.400 --> 16:18.733
And that's making it harder
and harder for me
to get out and get

16:18.767 --> 16:22.500
what I absolutely have to have
to eat for the winter.

16:22.533 --> 16:25.900
And it really affects
how we can even
survive out here.

16:25.933 --> 16:28.500
NARRATOR: To survive
along the Yukon River,

16:28.533 --> 16:31.700
Andy believes it is essential
to remove any predators

16:31.733 --> 16:34.000
that are a threat
to his food supply.

16:35.067 --> 16:37.867
Up and over. Up and over.

16:37.900 --> 16:40.100
Let's go haw. Let's go haw.

16:40.133 --> 16:42.500
Attaboys. Attaboys.
Good. You'll make it.

16:42.533 --> 16:44.500
You'll make it. Attaboys.

16:47.633 --> 16:49.667
That didn't look good.

16:52.900 --> 16:55.367
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Everybody, stay!

16:57.333 --> 16:58.667
Yeah!

16:58.700 --> 17:00.500
Good boys! Everybody, stay!

17:01.967 --> 17:05.567
All right, all right,
we've got some
wolf tracks here.

17:05.600 --> 17:08.233
I got multiple wolf tracks
in this slough here.

17:09.967 --> 17:11.633
Looks like they were
chasing something

17:11.667 --> 17:13.500
'cause they're
in a gallop here.

17:13.533 --> 17:15.733
Attaboy! Attaboy! Let's go!

17:15.767 --> 17:19.267
Think this spot's gonna be
a pretty good spot around here
to set some snares.

17:19.300 --> 17:20.767
Good boys!

17:20.800 --> 17:22.500
That's it! Get on that track.

17:22.533 --> 17:23.933
All right!

17:23.967 --> 17:26.167
Good job!

17:26.200 --> 17:28.967
I'll get these up into
the woods here
in a couple of places

17:29.000 --> 17:33.200
and then come back and start
setting some snares

17:33.233 --> 17:35.000
and see what I can do.

17:38.933 --> 17:41.967
These wolves have a really
good sense of smell.

17:42.000 --> 17:44.433
So if he's walking
down the river,

17:44.467 --> 17:47.133
I think they'll pick up
on this pretty quick.

17:48.467 --> 17:49.933
There's one.

17:52.133 --> 17:53.833
Go back down this way now.

17:59.433 --> 18:00.900
Killing daylight.

18:00.933 --> 18:03.067
I got two chunks
of moose meat in.

18:03.100 --> 18:06.600
Now I just gotta get in here
and just set snares
all around this area.

18:09.333 --> 18:13.133
My main emphasis for doing
all this trapping right now
is to try and knock

18:13.167 --> 18:18.367
a few of the predators off
so that the moose populations
can come back stronger.

18:18.400 --> 18:20.233
So, it's not gonna
go to waste.

18:20.267 --> 18:23.167
If I had a couple of wolves,
I could make a nice parka.

18:23.200 --> 18:25.133
So there's lots of things
I can do with the fur,

18:25.167 --> 18:27.500
but the main reason why
I'm doing this is to try

18:27.533 --> 18:29.233
and help the moose
in the area.

18:29.267 --> 18:31.533
So if there's something
I can do to help the abundance

18:31.567 --> 18:33.333
of the food
that I need to eat,

18:33.367 --> 18:35.400
then it's worth
my effort to do that.

18:39.033 --> 18:40.933
There we go.
That's the last one.

18:42.400 --> 18:45.867
It's time to head out of here,
back home, where it's warm.

18:45.900 --> 18:47.600
Right, let's go home!

18:47.633 --> 18:49.300
Attaboys!

19:10.900 --> 19:12.600
This lower section
of this river

19:12.633 --> 19:15.567
is always really bad with ice,
uh, very thin ice.

19:15.600 --> 19:18.833
It can be very deceiving
at times when you get
a snowfall over it.

19:18.867 --> 19:21.633
So I'm always a little bit
nervous in this lower section.

19:24.100 --> 19:27.200
That's not even hard to break
that with this pole.

19:29.267 --> 19:32.700
I think we're just gonna
have to go fast and...
You understand that, Tope?

19:32.733 --> 19:35.633
We're gonna go fast,
girl, right here.
Right here.

19:37.467 --> 19:39.700
Okay. Little Gee, little Gee,
little Gee!

19:39.733 --> 19:42.367
Attagirl, right there. Good.
Perfect. Let's go.

19:42.400 --> 19:45.533
Hup, hup, hup, hup! All right.

19:45.567 --> 19:48.533
Nobody hurt, but, uh, we still
got a long ways to go.

19:48.567 --> 19:49.900
So it's time to keep moving.

19:53.667 --> 19:55.667
CHIP: Life here
is done as it's done.

19:55.700 --> 19:56.833
It's all
cheque-in-the-mail stuff.

19:56.867 --> 19:59.300
It's not in your hands,
till it's in your hands.

20:00.867 --> 20:02.467
You can talk about might
all we want,

20:02.500 --> 20:04.767
but we don't fly
on the wings of maybe.

20:16.700 --> 20:18.067
-AGNES: Hi.
-A snow go, I heard one.

20:18.100 --> 20:20.000
Oh, look right there!

20:20.033 --> 20:22.500
Hee!

20:22.533 --> 20:25.733
NARRATOR: After Agnes
broke her rifle in
a snow machine crash...

20:25.767 --> 20:27.567
CHIP: Hey, Jeff!
What's going on?

20:27.600 --> 20:31.567
...Chip called on
a family friend
to bring out a new rifle.

20:31.600 --> 20:32.900
AGNES: Whoa! I got it.
I got it.

20:32.933 --> 20:34.867
-CHIP: You want coffee?
-I got it, mine!

20:34.900 --> 20:36.467
Thank you!

20:36.500 --> 20:38.133
CHIP: A friend of ours from
Noorvik's down here hunting

20:38.167 --> 20:40.500
and he brought down a rifle
for my wife that my daughter

20:40.533 --> 20:42.000
went over to her
aunt's and got.

20:42.033 --> 20:43.700
Okay, Chip. Yep.
I'll see you guys at home.

20:43.733 --> 20:44.967
AGNES: All right.
Thank you so much.

20:45.000 --> 20:46.767
-You're welcome.
-Good luck to you!

20:46.800 --> 20:48.333
Yep!

20:51.267 --> 20:52.400
AGNES: Hee!

20:52.433 --> 20:56.767
Well, I don't have
a new snow machine,

20:56.800 --> 20:59.067
but, uh, I have a new rifle.

21:01.800 --> 21:04.067
One hundred, right, 125?

21:04.100 --> 21:06.467
One fifty, just set it
on 150,

21:06.500 --> 21:09.233
give it a crank off
and see if you nail it.

21:09.267 --> 21:11.033
It's not a rifle
she's used for hunting.

21:11.067 --> 21:12.900
It's, um,
it's from her collection.

21:12.933 --> 21:15.300
We're not sure where
it hits or if it even works.

21:15.333 --> 21:17.733
But we have to test it
and make sure.

21:17.767 --> 21:19.200
Fire at will.

21:21.333 --> 21:24.233
You hit about two inches
to the right of the paper.

21:28.533 --> 21:31.700
You hit about
two inches closer.

21:33.200 --> 21:34.200
(GUNSHOT)

21:35.600 --> 21:37.967
-Hmm.
-Real close to where you were.
Here, let me go check now.

21:38.600 --> 21:40.067
I'll zip over there.

21:44.900 --> 21:48.333
It's good to get familiarised
with the trigger, the, um,

21:48.367 --> 21:51.900
the action of the bulk,
and the feel,

21:51.933 --> 21:55.433
and see how long the, um,
how much play I have

21:55.467 --> 21:57.133
before the bullet
actually goes off.

21:57.167 --> 21:58.433
So this is good practice,

21:58.467 --> 22:01.100
regardless
of if I hit or not.

22:01.133 --> 22:04.633
You are hitting to the right.
So shoot more to the left.

22:09.700 --> 22:12.600
-(GUNSHOT)
-Hitting high.

22:12.633 --> 22:15.233
So I think it's
the rifle hitting high.

22:15.267 --> 22:17.467
I really do. What does
your trigger feel like?

22:17.500 --> 22:19.533
Does it feel
like your last rifle?

22:19.567 --> 22:21.233
Not really.

22:21.267 --> 22:23.533
Okay. That's a trouble, too.

22:23.567 --> 22:26.100
-Yeah, we gotta get
used to that.
-Yep.

22:26.133 --> 22:27.700
So we'll get up there
and give it a try

22:27.733 --> 22:30.300
-and we'll see
what happens, all right?
-Yeah.

22:30.333 --> 22:34.100
That rifle's not exactly
dialled in for, um, my wife.

22:34.133 --> 22:35.600
She, uh, took a few shots.

22:35.633 --> 22:37.767
And so she's only missing
by an inch or two
on this side,

22:37.800 --> 22:40.833
an inch or two on this side.
So she's keeping it
within a foot by a foot.

22:40.867 --> 22:42.500
And that's good enough
for caribou.

22:42.533 --> 22:45.400
You can put it right
in the middle of their chest,
and it will hit within a foot,

22:45.433 --> 22:48.300
you're gonna get
an animal really well.
No problem.

22:50.867 --> 22:53.967
ERIK: Every day I work.
You know, out cutting
some firewood,

22:54.000 --> 22:55.800
out hunting, trapping.

22:55.833 --> 22:58.133
Whatever it is, I'm into being
productive every day.

23:09.633 --> 23:12.600
MARTHA: (GIGGLES)
You ran into me.

23:12.633 --> 23:14.400
NARRATOR: Erik and Martha
have built a smoker

23:14.433 --> 23:17.233
to prepare meat
they harvested themselves.

23:19.600 --> 23:23.467
But before it can be used,
it must be moved
out of the hangar.

23:25.533 --> 23:26.800
MARTHA: Your snow machine's
gonna be able

23:26.833 --> 23:28.400
-to pull this thing?
-I am not sure.

23:28.433 --> 23:31.633
Try with a snow machine.
If not, we'll just hook
the truck up to it.

23:35.633 --> 23:37.400
MARTHA: So we got
the tow hitch attached.

23:37.433 --> 23:41.733
We're gonna see if we can
get the smoker
out of the hangar now.

23:46.733 --> 23:48.567
(SNOW MACHINE BEEPING)

23:51.367 --> 23:52.733
ERIK: All right.

23:53.800 --> 23:55.467
(SNOW MACHINE REVVING)

23:57.500 --> 23:59.000
MARTHA: No.

24:00.400 --> 24:01.833
It's not gonna happen.

24:04.267 --> 24:07.200
ERIK: We tried to pull
the smokehouse out
with the snow machine.

24:07.233 --> 24:09.667
I think we can probably get it
if we kept reefing on it,

24:09.700 --> 24:13.233
but it's not worth damaging
a snow machine over it.

24:13.267 --> 24:17.333
So I'm just gonna pull
my truck around, hook onto it,
and drag it on out.

24:19.300 --> 24:20.667
That's good!

24:21.833 --> 24:24.333
Start off slow so we can get
the line taut.

24:26.533 --> 24:28.067
Little bit more.

24:28.967 --> 24:30.733
Okay!

24:32.433 --> 24:34.300
Oh, oh!

24:39.467 --> 24:41.667
I knew it was gonna
hit that lip!

24:41.700 --> 24:44.267
It hit that lip
and busted the skid off.

24:45.367 --> 24:47.033
We just tried pulling
the smokehouse out.

24:47.067 --> 24:51.000
Unfortunately, we didn't have
the skids braced well,
so they came together and, uh,

24:51.033 --> 24:54.600
in turn, pulled
the whole frame of the
smokehouse in also.

24:54.633 --> 24:56.933
So, a little bit of a bummer.

24:56.967 --> 24:58.633
How'd that happen?

24:58.667 --> 25:00.733
The chain choked
the two pieces together

25:00.767 --> 25:02.667
because there was no
crosspiece here.

25:03.667 --> 25:05.833
I'm irritated in myself
for rushing,

25:05.867 --> 25:07.733
not putting
a good support on it.

25:09.500 --> 25:13.667
Gonna take this 2 x 6
and make the skids
a little bit sturdier

25:13.700 --> 25:16.067
by putting it in between,
so next time when we pull,

25:16.100 --> 25:17.467
at least they won't
come together.

25:17.500 --> 25:19.733
Stand on this,
will you, Martha?

25:23.467 --> 25:25.033
Now we got the bracing
on there,

25:25.067 --> 25:26.800
I'm gonna go ahead
and hook it onto my truck

25:26.833 --> 25:29.533
and hopefully it should
be secure and we'll go ahead
and we'll be able to pull it

25:29.567 --> 25:31.233
across the yard
where we want it.

25:41.000 --> 25:42.367
MARTHA: We just moved
the smokehouse

25:42.400 --> 25:45.200
to where it's gonna sit
temporarily
and get it smoking.

25:54.467 --> 25:57.667
I'm gonna put this little
wood stove in there
and fire her up.

26:00.967 --> 26:04.400
So now Erik's
sticking the alder in there.

26:04.433 --> 26:07.633
Alder is a highly desirable
wood to use for a smoker.

26:07.667 --> 26:11.300
A nice flavour that comes off
of it that will be impregnated
into the meat.

26:12.500 --> 26:13.867
There she goes.

26:15.333 --> 26:17.800
Being able to put the
moose meat in there,
get that fire going,

26:17.833 --> 26:20.133
get it smoking in there,
it's great, you know.

26:20.167 --> 26:24.067
It'll be good and it'll have
that really good smoky smell
and taste to it.

26:25.200 --> 26:27.500
Close the doors, let it smoke.

26:29.833 --> 26:31.733
ANDY: Alaskans
are very unique people.

26:31.767 --> 26:33.333
We're all very independent.

26:33.367 --> 26:37.033
We're all very inventive,
tough, hardy souls

26:37.067 --> 26:39.367
that wanna take care
of themselves.

26:55.100 --> 26:56.800
Hey, Briggus, boy!

26:56.833 --> 26:59.300
Let's go check some traps.

26:59.333 --> 27:00.500
Let's go check some traps.

27:00.533 --> 27:02.333
We gotta go see
if we got some wolves.

27:02.367 --> 27:06.700
NARRATOR: Andy has set traps
for wolves in order to protect
the moose population,

27:06.733 --> 27:10.600
an essential source
of food and protein
along the Yukon River.

27:10.633 --> 27:12.233
So we'll go check
those traps today

27:12.267 --> 27:14.733
and hopefully we'll come
home with a little bit
of fur to skin.

27:16.600 --> 27:19.600
Pack of wolves is probably
one of the most lethal things
on the planet,

27:19.633 --> 27:21.833
as far as hunting goes.

27:21.867 --> 27:24.567
So, if you have
that knowledge,
and you know how to use that,

27:24.600 --> 27:26.100
you can use it
to your advantage

27:26.133 --> 27:29.433
to try and take advantage
of the wolves and trap them.

27:30.467 --> 27:32.900
You guys are smoking
down the trail today!

27:32.933 --> 27:34.033
Good boys!

27:34.067 --> 27:35.567
Yee-haw!

27:35.600 --> 27:37.200
So it's all luck.

27:37.233 --> 27:39.233
You know, there's a certain
amount of skill
in everything you do,

27:39.267 --> 27:41.333
but if the wolves
don't come through,
you're not gonna catch them.

27:41.367 --> 27:43.067
It's just the way it works.

27:44.467 --> 27:46.533
Gee! Gee! Gee!

27:46.567 --> 27:49.067
Attaboys! Good! Good!
Good! Good!

27:49.700 --> 27:51.567
Whoa.

27:51.600 --> 27:53.100
Whoa.

27:53.133 --> 27:54.767
Good dogs.

27:55.533 --> 27:57.433
Everybody, stay. Good boys.

27:57.467 --> 28:01.500
I'll just walk up there
and try and disturb
as little as possible,

28:01.533 --> 28:03.700
check out all the snare sites.

28:08.100 --> 28:11.167
I can see the rest
of my snares down
through the line here.

28:11.200 --> 28:14.000
I don't see anything
that's disturbed.

28:16.567 --> 28:18.900
I've got another bait here.
A leghold here.

28:18.933 --> 28:21.600
There's another snare
right there in that opening.

28:21.633 --> 28:25.167
Looks to me like I got skunked
on this spot right now.

28:25.200 --> 28:27.233
It's just gonna
take more time.

28:28.033 --> 28:30.033
So a little bit disappointing.

28:30.067 --> 28:33.333
Like everything I do,
I always try
and make it multi-purpose

28:33.367 --> 28:35.867
and so I'm not just gonna go
out and set for wolves,

28:35.900 --> 28:38.833
I'm gonna set for marten,
because they bring
me a few bucks,

28:38.867 --> 28:40.500
whether I sell them
to a furrier

28:40.533 --> 28:45.100
or whether I make something
out of them myself,
it's dollars in my pocket.

28:45.133 --> 28:48.133
So what I wanna do here
is I wanna make a marten set,

28:48.167 --> 28:51.233
just a natural one,
using the branches.

28:51.267 --> 28:53.500
This is one of my favourite
ways to set for them.

28:56.200 --> 28:58.900
Trying to build a little
bit of an income from this

28:58.933 --> 29:02.633
to help offset the cost
of dog food and other supplies
that I need.

29:02.667 --> 29:04.200
There's one set.

29:05.667 --> 29:09.267
I think I'll make another one
on this tree right here.

29:09.300 --> 29:12.667
It's just a matter
of one animal finding this,
and then from that point on,

29:12.700 --> 29:15.700
a lot of the other
animals will start
following those tracks.

29:15.733 --> 29:18.267
Yeah, okay.

29:18.300 --> 29:20.367
So there's two marten sets.

29:22.067 --> 29:24.300
Okay. Let's go.

29:24.333 --> 29:26.767
I'll just keep checking about
every four or five days

29:26.800 --> 29:29.533
and sooner or later,
I'm gonna catch something
here, I know.

29:30.967 --> 29:32.900
AGNES: Lots of little things
get thrown at you,

29:32.933 --> 29:35.800
but when you're out here,
you just have to keep
moving forward

29:35.833 --> 29:39.967
and keep on keeping on
and keep on hunting.

29:40.000 --> 29:41.667

NARRATOR: The Hailstones
are hunting for caribou,

30:00.133 --> 30:02.067
which will provide
meat and fur

30:02.100 --> 30:05.000
that will help them survive
the months to come.

30:09.933 --> 30:13.233
I'm on top of a ridge top,

30:13.267 --> 30:17.833
and, uh, the caribou
were slowly eating their
way up this way.

30:17.867 --> 30:20.500
So any moment
they should be coming soon.

30:20.533 --> 30:23.200
So I just keep my eyes open.

30:23.233 --> 30:25.467
Whichever direction
they come from,

30:25.500 --> 30:28.000
I just, pretty much,
have to be ready.

30:28.033 --> 30:30.067
Whether it's scouting around
looking for different things,

30:30.100 --> 30:32.700
or we're going directly
to where we know
what the conditions are

30:32.733 --> 30:35.133
and we can hunt the area,
we're always hunting.

30:35.167 --> 30:37.100
AGNES: They're coming
straight to us!

30:47.867 --> 30:49.533
-I got him!
-Good one.

30:51.167 --> 30:54.167
CHIP: We didn't get defeated
on the caribou.
We were able to ride.

30:54.200 --> 30:57.967
We were able to, um,
come up about,
maybe 2,000 caribou here.

30:58.000 --> 30:59.433
And we had
to pick out a good one.

30:59.467 --> 31:00.933
Whew, we got one.

31:00.967 --> 31:03.300
This is a good piece
of meat right here.

31:03.333 --> 31:05.400
There was no mistake
in shooting this one.

31:05.433 --> 31:09.233
He's fat, too.
So I can't complain.
He's a young bull.

31:09.267 --> 31:11.100
We thought a cow,
but he's a young bull.

31:15.167 --> 31:17.633
There's always
more caribou around,

31:17.667 --> 31:23.100
so just have to work on meat,
and try for another one,
and keep your eyes open

31:23.133 --> 31:25.233
'cause there's
a lot of fur around, too.

she is always at the mercy
of Mother Nature.

The update on the flight is,
today is a scratch.

32:16.767 --> 32:20.533
Um, plane cannot get in here
and I'm just waiting to hear

32:20.567 --> 32:22.500
whether I can reschedule
it for tomorrow.

32:22.533 --> 32:27.200
It cost me 500 bucks just to,
in the fuel to work the runway
the last day and a half.

32:27.233 --> 32:28.767
But it's just part of the risk
of being here.

32:28.800 --> 32:32.267
I can plan for it,
and I can get ready for it,
and in the end,

32:32.300 --> 32:34.767
I'm not the one with control
out here, Mother Nature is.

32:35.800 --> 32:38.767
Last night, I was trying
to clear the runway

32:38.800 --> 32:41.667
and the Bobcat started having
some power issues.

32:41.700 --> 32:45.200
I have a feeling my hydraulic,
uh, pump is going out.

32:46.133 --> 32:48.667
I'm gonna top it off

32:48.700 --> 32:50.433
with a little bit
of hydraulics.

32:51.833 --> 32:53.067
It's not feeling happy.

32:53.100 --> 32:55.367
So, I either get it done

32:55.400 --> 32:58.800
or bust it down trying.

32:58.833 --> 33:01.133
I mean, everything else
has been failing this year,

33:01.167 --> 33:03.033
might as well go for broke
and get it all.

33:04.867 --> 33:08.967
I've decided I'm gonna
go ahead and push this thing
as hard as I can today.

33:09.000 --> 33:11.733
It may be a mistake,
I may end up
with a lawn decoration.

33:11.767 --> 33:13.533
Even if the Caravan
can't come in,

33:13.567 --> 33:15.300
there's other pilots
flying around.

33:15.333 --> 33:17.800
They're gonna think it's safe,
and it's not.

33:17.833 --> 33:20.133
So I've gotta go see
if I can't just finish
dragging it

33:20.167 --> 33:21.700
and then let nature
do its business.

33:21.733 --> 33:24.033
At least then,
I've given it my all.

33:26.133 --> 33:28.133
I'm definitely risking
the equipment.

33:28.167 --> 33:30.267
I know I have to replace
the hydraulic pump.

33:30.300 --> 33:32.300
I know I've got
filters to replace.

33:32.333 --> 33:34.667
I know I've got some issues.

33:34.700 --> 33:36.900
I'm hoping that
it just holds its own.

33:36.933 --> 33:40.333
These birds need to be
safely on the ground.

33:40.367 --> 33:43.867
They need to know Kavik
is a place to go and be safe.

33:46.833 --> 33:49.500
The runway is as good
as I can get it.

33:49.533 --> 33:55.000
I am pleased that I got
a good mile, solid mile
of the runway

33:55.033 --> 33:57.033
done nice and smooth.

33:58.200 --> 33:59.967

morning,

34:00.000 --> 34:02.100
verify that it's still
in good shape,

and, uh, when he calls,
I'll give him
the honest report.

I want to be fishing.

and come live
out in the woods.

MARTHA: So, uh, our meat's
been smoking in here
for a couple hours.

34:38.700 --> 34:41.100
Should been long enough
to give it a good, smoky taste

34:41.133 --> 34:42.900
from that alder
we put in there.

34:42.933 --> 34:46.267
I'm gonna go and grab
a good piece
for dinner for Erik and I.

34:50.800 --> 34:53.467
Looking good in here.

34:53.500 --> 34:57.967
I think I'm gonna go with
this one right here.
Right on the top shelf.

34:58.000 --> 34:59.467
Took this one
off the top shelf,

34:59.500 --> 35:03.100
so I guess it's what you would
call a top-shelf meat.

35:03.133 --> 35:04.567
Nice.

35:04.600 --> 35:05.967
Gonna go cook it up.

35:10.200 --> 35:15.333
Um, smoker was a good little
project for Erik and I.

35:15.367 --> 35:18.633
That was a little bit
of a challenge there at the
end when it came apart,

35:18.667 --> 35:21.867
but, uh, Erik and I
always, uh,

35:21.900 --> 35:25.467
overcome whatever issues
we have out here,
which you gotta do anyway.

35:25.500 --> 35:29.600
You can't rely on anybody
else but yourselves,
so you work independently.

35:29.633 --> 35:31.633
It's really cool to think
that just not too long ago,

35:31.667 --> 35:36.233
Erik and I were brainstorming
up this idea about this whole
smokehouse, and, uh,

35:36.267 --> 35:39.367
built the smoker and then
smelled the fruits of our
labour.

35:42.033 --> 35:44.533
-Do you like it?
-Mmm-hmm.

35:44.567 --> 35:46.667

worked out pretty good.

36:23.700 --> 36:26.033
It's time to go
check snares and traps.

36:26.067 --> 36:29.533
These traps and snares
have been out
for a little over a week.

36:29.567 --> 36:31.800
I got skunked at my first set.

36:32.267 --> 36:33.300
There you go.

36:33.333 --> 36:35.300
Second time's a charm
is what I'm hoping for.

36:36.233 --> 36:39.267
Let's go, yeah! All right!

36:39.300 --> 36:42.833
There's no one thing
that a person makes
his living on out here.

36:42.867 --> 36:45.233
You have to be multi-talented.

36:45.267 --> 36:49.167
You have to be
kind of an opportunist.

36:49.200 --> 36:53.100
I don't think I'll ever
stop trapping, even when
I'm 70 years old.

36:53.133 --> 36:55.333
Attaboys. On by. Let's go.

36:55.367 --> 36:56.933
Straight ahead. Let's go.

37:00.367 --> 37:03.867
Well, looks like, uh,
I'm at the end
of my line here.

37:05.267 --> 37:09.767
Go check some snares
and a few marten sets.

37:09.800 --> 37:12.933
And I'm not seeing any
disturbances in the trees.

37:12.967 --> 37:14.967
So there's a snare there.

37:17.533 --> 37:19.667
There's my bait set over here.

37:21.733 --> 37:23.733
One here.

37:23.767 --> 37:26.833
A little bit early on,
anything big coming
through here,

37:26.867 --> 37:29.267
but I'm gonna leave all these
snares where they're at.

37:29.300 --> 37:32.800
The longer they're out here,
the better chance I have
of catching something.

37:35.500 --> 37:39.300
I think I'll, I'll head on
back and go check
the rest of my traps.

37:39.333 --> 37:42.567
And there's two more
marten sets and we'll go back

37:42.600 --> 37:45.067
and see if I have a little
bit of luck in that area.

37:47.567 --> 37:50.700
It kind of looks like there's
something hanging there.

37:56.000 --> 37:57.467
Yeah, baby!

37:57.500 --> 37:59.367
So we've got one marten here.

38:01.500 --> 38:03.000
All right!

38:03.033 --> 38:06.867
He's frozen solid,
so he was definitely caught
in the cold weather.

38:06.900 --> 38:08.933
It's been a few days.

38:08.967 --> 38:11.367
I feel good there's one,
let's go check
some more traps,

38:11.400 --> 38:12.833
see if I have any more luck.

38:14.933 --> 38:16.200
Yeah, buddy!

38:17.500 --> 38:19.133
Hello, Mr Marten.

38:20.500 --> 38:22.600
All right.

38:22.633 --> 38:24.400
That's a nice-looking marten.

38:25.333 --> 38:28.900
So that's two.
That makes me feel good.

38:28.933 --> 38:31.467
I like coming home
with something in this bag.

38:33.033 --> 38:34.733
We're good to go.

38:34.767 --> 38:38.333
It's a pretty productive area.
We'll just keep setting,
hopefully we'll keep catching.

38:39.167 --> 38:40.567
Good day today.

38:40.600 --> 38:42.333
Look at that, Tope.

38:42.367 --> 38:47.567
Didn't pick up any wolves,
but I've got two nice marten,
and, uh, so I've got some fur.

38:49.333 --> 38:52.100
Didn't do any real predator
control to help
the moose right now,

38:52.133 --> 38:54.833
but it's just
a matter of time.

38:54.867 --> 38:56.367
Time and patience.

38:58.400 --> 39:00.633
Okay, let's go home. Yeah!

39:00.667 --> 39:02.000
Go home and skin some marten.

39:04.933 --> 39:08.167
Marten skins peel off
pretty easily
once you get going.

39:09.767 --> 39:10.933
And once it gets
to this point,

39:10.967 --> 39:13.100
I usually like
to hang them up.

39:21.067 --> 39:24.767
Go slow and easy right here
'cause I don't wanna tear it.

39:24.800 --> 39:27.767
Trapping is probably
the only way that a person
out in the bush

39:27.800 --> 39:30.100
can be guaranteed
making some money.

39:30.133 --> 39:32.300
Um, you know,
I say all the time,

39:32.333 --> 39:35.733
the only way to really live
out here is you gotta
diversify what you're doing.

39:35.767 --> 39:37.800
Fact remains that I have
to make a living, too

39:37.833 --> 39:43.500
and this is one
of the few ways that I can
supplement my income.

39:43.533 --> 39:45.000
There we go.

39:47.700 --> 39:50.900
And so now what I need
to do is I need to put it
on the board

39:50.933 --> 39:52.467
with the flesh side out.

39:52.500 --> 39:55.667
I'm gonna stretch it out
and that's gonna dry
in that shape,

39:55.700 --> 40:00.833
and that gives it a certain
form that the fur buyers like.

40:00.867 --> 40:04.400
Generally speaking,
I'd say 90 bucks
for one animal like this.

40:04.433 --> 40:05.800
I've got one of them
skinned out.

40:05.833 --> 40:07.800
This one's still
a little bit stiff.

40:07.833 --> 40:10.067
He's not quite
ready to skin out,

40:10.100 --> 40:13.600
so we'll let this guy
sit here and thaw out
a little bit more.

40:17.467 --> 40:21.833
So this was a pretty,
pretty good day for me.
I picked up a couple marten.

40:21.867 --> 40:26.000
I didn't pick up any wolves,
but, uh, for the amount
of time that I put into it,

40:26.033 --> 40:31.267
it's good to get a little bit
of fur here and, um, keep
adding to my collection.

40:31.300 --> 40:36.400
And as time goes on,
I'm hoping that I'll pick up
a wolf or two in those snares.

40:36.433 --> 40:39.500
I'll just keep at it
all winter long,
see what I end up with.

40:41.167 --> 40:42.633
It was a good day.

40:46.433 --> 40:48.167
SUE: Mother Nature and I
are always kind of

40:48.200 --> 40:50.067
playing a game of cards,
it's like poker.

40:50.100 --> 40:52.300
Occasionally, she deals
herself a winning hand.

40:52.333 --> 40:54.733
You know, and I just gotta
wait till we shuffle again.

40:54.767 --> 40:57.600
You know, eventually
I'll get my, uh, full house.

41:04.467 --> 41:06.267
Good bit of news, finally.

41:06.300 --> 41:11.400
It's been several days
with this storm and the fog
is now finally pulling back.

41:11.433 --> 41:13.867
Supposed to be blue bird
in the next couple of hours.

41:13.900 --> 41:17.100
So I'm just checking
the runway with the wind
that we've had.

41:17.133 --> 41:18.700
What kind of drifts
have built up?

41:18.733 --> 41:21.933
What do I need to do
to make this
a perfect landing?

41:21.967 --> 41:27.267
So I'm going up and down
and seeing, how wide can I
tell them is a good area?

41:27.300 --> 41:30.000
How long of an area
is acceptable?

41:30.033 --> 41:31.667
It's looking pretty good!

41:31.700 --> 41:34.567
The eastern end of the runway
looks beautiful.

41:34.600 --> 41:37.033
If he sticks to the centre,
he's got a good run.

41:37.067 --> 41:40.667
But I'm gonna mark
some of these drifts
with my machine.

41:40.700 --> 41:45.700
I mark the drifts by just
running over the drift
with the Argo.

41:45.733 --> 41:48.267
And that's gonna leave a trail

41:48.300 --> 41:54.100
and he'll be able to see
from the air,
stay between the lines.

41:54.133 --> 41:58.600
Because it's not bad,
it's just I care a lot about
the safety of these guys.

42:05.133 --> 42:07.167
It's just beautiful,
blue skies.

42:07.200 --> 42:10.167
Uh, no obscurations at all.

42:10.200 --> 42:13.400
I'm really happy,
yay, a new toy.

42:13.433 --> 42:16.767
But actually, I...
Serious face, it's a new tool.
(SNORTS)

42:24.167 --> 42:27.667
These guys live 500 miles
away from me,
but any time I need them,

42:27.700 --> 42:28.867
bam, they're there.

42:31.133 --> 42:32.800
-How are you doing, Sue?
-Good. How are you doing?

42:32.833 --> 42:33.967
-Pretty good.
-Thank you.

42:34.000 --> 42:35.267
-Good to see you.
-Yeah, you, too.

42:35.300 --> 42:36.833
I appreciate all the help.

42:36.867 --> 42:38.200
How was the runway?

42:38.233 --> 42:39.467
-The runway's good, yeah.
-Okay.

42:39.500 --> 42:42.433
Dirk got here safely
and the snow machine is here.

42:42.467 --> 42:45.300
The Argo was a
go-slow-and-get-
there-and-back.

42:45.333 --> 42:46.833
This is a go-fast.

42:46.867 --> 42:50.867
Time for me to see
what I can do here.

42:52.633 --> 42:54.167
(ENGINE STARTS)

42:54.200 --> 42:55.633
Yay!

42:57.967 --> 43:02.567
It seemed like Mother Nature
dealt herself a winning hand
on the old weather conditions.

43:02.600 --> 43:04.400
Susie pulled out
a royal flush in the end.

43:04.433 --> 43:09.633
It's a beautiful day,
he landed no problems,
and I've got my new "tool."

43:10.400 --> 43:11.733
Yay!

43:14.100 --> 43:15.267
Got a new tool.
