00:01.839 --> 00:03.354
<i>General Zod is Superman's</i>

00:03.560 --> 00:04.560
<i>greatest enemy.</i>

00:04.640 --> 00:06.096
<i>Has traveled back through
time to get here.</i>

00:06.120 --> 00:07.120
I'm your son.

00:07.280 --> 00:10.352
<i>Brainiac takes Kandor City
causing the planet to explode.</i>

00:10.560 --> 00:12.279
Your friend here
didn't mention that.

00:12.480 --> 00:14.392
This whole time you knew,
and you said nothing!

00:14.520 --> 00:16.512
Seg, you cannot
trust this man!

00:16.680 --> 00:18.040
I know I should've
told you before,

00:18.160 --> 00:19.656
but, I mean, what was I
supposed to say?

00:19.680 --> 00:21.353
"By the way, your world's
gonna explode."

00:21.520 --> 00:23.477
<i>I've learned of a hidden
weapon that would give</i>

00:23.640 --> 00:25.632
<i>- even Brainiac pause.
- It's called Doomsday.</i>

00:25.800 --> 00:27.234
<i>The Cythonnites...
this Doomsday</i>

00:27.400 --> 00:28.680
<i>is what they're sworn
to protect.</i>

00:31.440 --> 00:33.016
Find your Zeta-Beam gadget
and ride it back

00:33.040 --> 00:35.032
to wherever you came from
and never come back!

00:35.200 --> 00:36.759
Why do you want
to save Lyta Zod?

00:36.920 --> 00:38.991
- Because I love her.
- Will you help her?

00:39.240 --> 00:40.037
<i>She's a traitor.</i>

00:40.200 --> 00:42.874
<i>If we don't stop Lyta's
execution, we lose Jayna.</i>

00:43.040 --> 00:44.759
Pledge your support
to my father.

00:45.600 --> 00:47.557
Help us overthrow
the Voice of Rao.

00:47.760 --> 00:50.229
<i>One word from you,
and she is saved.</i>

00:50.440 --> 00:51.954
This world will
only improve...

00:52.120 --> 00:53.395
Under your leadership?

00:53.520 --> 00:55.398
It is time to look
to the future.

00:55.600 --> 00:57.280
There's only one left
to complete the team,

00:57.360 --> 00:58.360
<i>Commander Dev-Em.</i>

00:58.440 --> 01:02.036
Perhaps it's time you saw
who it is you vowed to serve.

01:17.520 --> 01:20.433
Primus!
Please, Primus, help!

01:20.680 --> 01:21.955
Help!

01:26.360 --> 01:30.798
<i>You are being given
a precious gift.</i>

01:31.160 --> 01:35.632
Freedom from your concerns
and attachments.

01:44.040 --> 01:46.680
You have now glimpsed
the infinite intelligence

01:46.800 --> 01:50.510
and seen the deliverance
that I bring.

01:55.400 --> 01:57.232
Are you ready to serve?

01:57.720 --> 02:02.192
Are you ready to be
the instruments of my will?

02:28.840 --> 02:31.230
We found him in a skimmer
heading for Argo City.

02:31.400 --> 02:33.835
Praise be to Rao
that you are unharmed.

02:34.520 --> 02:35.590
Leave us.

02:38.440 --> 02:40.830
I will personally see to it
that the savages

02:41.000 --> 02:43.390
that perpetrated this attack
are dealt with swiftly.

02:43.520 --> 02:44.954
No mercy shall be shown.

02:45.120 --> 02:46.679
We will make Black Zero
bleed for...

02:46.840 --> 02:50.470
I find it curious that
the Chief Magistrate

02:50.680 --> 02:54.037
would be out of the city as a
coup attempt was taking place.

02:54.280 --> 02:56.016
You can't possibly believe
that I had anything

02:56.040 --> 02:57.394
to do with this.

02:57.680 --> 02:58.880
I was on a diplomatic mission.

02:59.040 --> 03:01.032
There was nothing nefarious
about my absence.

03:01.240 --> 03:03.516
- It was merely...
- Coincidence?

03:03.800 --> 03:05.280
Your Eminence, please.
I would...

03:05.440 --> 03:08.558
You are lying.

03:09.200 --> 03:12.272
So easy to tell
with your species.

03:14.400 --> 03:16.676
Intensified breathing,

03:16.880 --> 03:18.394
elevated heart rate,

03:18.640 --> 03:20.996
the pheromones
you generate,

03:21.160 --> 03:25.279
all are windows into
your limited nature.

03:25.520 --> 03:29.309
There is nothing
you can hide from me.

03:29.520 --> 03:30.954
I had no part in this.

03:32.720 --> 03:35.189
My allegiance belongs to you.

03:35.960 --> 03:37.189
Look at me.

03:37.440 --> 03:39.830
None are worthy to look
upon the Voice of Rao's face.

03:48.800 --> 03:51.269
There is no Voice of Rao.

03:53.480 --> 03:57.679
Only the agent
of Brainiac.

04:07.400 --> 04:09.312
Checking
the rear perimeter now.

04:14.200 --> 04:16.112
I'm getting a very
bad feeling about this.

04:16.279 --> 04:18.560
That's the third patrol we've
seen in the last two blocks.

04:18.640 --> 04:19.880
It's the last day
of Nova Cycle.

04:19.920 --> 04:21.877
Why is there no one drunk
and running naked

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
through the streets?

04:24.600 --> 04:25.920
How are you holding up?

04:26.160 --> 04:27.560
I just need
to catch my breath.

04:28.880 --> 04:31.200
Something must have happened
to warrant the extra security.

04:35.200 --> 04:36.976
We gotta get him to
a Guild hospital right now.

04:37.000 --> 04:38.639
He is a wanted terrorist.

04:38.840 --> 04:40.638
We won't get past
the checkpoint.

04:41.200 --> 04:43.431
Oh, shit.

04:51.080 --> 04:52.878
Morning. Hi.

04:53.040 --> 04:54.633
He... don't worry about him.

04:54.800 --> 04:56.840
He's just another casualty
of the Nova celebrations,

04:56.960 --> 04:58.076
if you know what I mean.

04:58.560 --> 04:59.710
I'm gonna take him home.

04:59.880 --> 05:01.633
S-home... that way.

05:01.800 --> 05:03.951
I'll handle it myself.
It's all good.

05:06.240 --> 05:08.630
You have 20 minutes
before the curfew begins.

05:10.920 --> 05:13.515
Thanks, guys.
Thanks for keeping us safe.

05:13.800 --> 05:15.075
You guys have a good one, now.

05:22.480 --> 05:24.320
Come on, we're moving.
Where are we taking him?

05:24.960 --> 05:25.960
Only place we can.

05:27.920 --> 05:29.673
Are you here to destroy us?

05:29.840 --> 05:31.240
Don't be foolish.

05:32.120 --> 05:34.635
I'm here to save you.

05:35.120 --> 05:37.510
- From what?
- Entropy.

05:38.120 --> 05:42.990
I will lead this city
into a glorious new future.

05:43.800 --> 05:48.636
Your way of life preserved
for all eternity.

05:51.600 --> 05:53.592
Then you and I
share the same goals...

05:53.720 --> 05:55.359
the same vision.

05:55.520 --> 05:57.239
Let me serve you.

05:57.400 --> 05:58.959
An interesting offer.

05:59.760 --> 06:03.595
Let's put your newfound loyalty
to the test.

06:04.000 --> 06:06.674
If I detect deception,

06:07.040 --> 06:08.474
you die.

06:09.360 --> 06:11.750
Who was behind
this coup attempt?

06:14.680 --> 06:16.717
I was, it...

06:16.880 --> 06:19.952
Along with Primus Zod.

06:20.320 --> 06:24.109
We also had the support of five
members of the Supreme Council.

06:24.400 --> 06:28.394
Why did you wish
your leader dead?

06:28.560 --> 06:31.359
He was an ignorant zealot
who peddled false hopes

06:31.520 --> 06:33.432
in a nonexistent god.

06:34.120 --> 06:37.079
You don't believe
in this sun god of yours.

06:37.400 --> 06:38.400
Why?

06:42.920 --> 06:44.320
My parents...

06:45.840 --> 06:49.038
worshiped the goddess of ice,

06:49.240 --> 06:50.799
Cythonna.

06:51.000 --> 06:53.674
After the Cataclysm,
all religions except Raoism

06:53.800 --> 06:56.634
were banned
but unofficially tolerated.

06:57.640 --> 06:59.597
When the Voice of Rao
was anointed,

06:59.760 --> 07:03.276
he initiated the Great Purge,
and those who did not convert

07:03.480 --> 07:06.598
were killed and disappeared.

07:07.760 --> 07:09.717
And my parents refused.

07:13.400 --> 07:15.437
And I never saw them again.

07:18.480 --> 07:20.711
All I know is...

07:21.280 --> 07:24.398
their god couldn't save them
any more than Rao could save

07:24.560 --> 07:26.040
his prophet from you.

07:28.320 --> 07:31.438
What's the point of believing
in something that has no power?

07:32.040 --> 07:34.191
So what do you believe in?

07:34.880 --> 07:36.360
Myself.

07:36.520 --> 07:38.830
I took action because I could
see that I was the only one

07:39.000 --> 07:41.913
in this city with the vision
and strength to lead.

07:42.080 --> 07:45.869
And do you still hold
to that belief?

07:49.200 --> 07:52.193
No.

07:52.360 --> 07:55.159
Perhaps you may be
useful after all.

07:57.960 --> 07:59.076
Tell me...

08:00.400 --> 08:03.552
how would you deal
with these traitors?

08:09.520 --> 08:11.591
They must be
publicly executed.

08:11.840 --> 08:14.116
All of them.
A message must be sent.

08:14.280 --> 08:16.158
The people will expect it.

08:16.480 --> 08:18.233
Let it be done.

08:20.840 --> 08:22.479
I do have one more question.

08:23.760 --> 08:27.436
Have you given me the names
of all the conspirators?

08:33.000 --> 08:34.753
Nyssa-Vex,

08:35.280 --> 08:36.714
my daughter...

08:40.799 --> 08:42.393
She was also involved.

08:42.559 --> 08:44.392
Then she must be
executed too.

08:45.400 --> 08:46.400
Correct?

08:52.680 --> 08:54.717
I ask you to allow me to...

08:57.280 --> 08:59.431
Handle this matter.

09:00.080 --> 09:02.037
Very well.

09:20.240 --> 09:21.913
- What's going on?
- Nyssa-Vex,

09:22.120 --> 09:23.656
you've been placed
under arrest and confined

09:23.680 --> 09:25.672
- to your quarters.
- Under whose authority?

09:25.880 --> 09:28.395
Chief Magistrate Daron-Vex.

09:32.560 --> 09:36.634
And that is why you can't see
a Rondor Beast's testicles

09:36.840 --> 09:37.840
when it walks.

09:38.400 --> 09:40.039
- I mean...
- Kem!

09:43.840 --> 09:45.672
Seg, where have you been,
and who is this guy?

09:45.840 --> 09:48.719
Get everyone out of here.
Now.

09:50.400 --> 09:52.312
- Now!
- Okay.

09:54.560 --> 09:56.358
All right, everybody out!
Finish your drinks!

09:56.520 --> 09:58.318
We're closed!
Let's go!

09:58.720 --> 09:59.720
Now.

10:01.240 --> 10:02.833
Come on, let's go.
Come on.

10:03.000 --> 10:04.753
Go home to your families.
They miss you.

10:04.920 --> 10:06.036
- Hey.
- Closing time.

10:06.240 --> 10:07.754
Leave your drinks.
Pay me tomorrow.

10:07.960 --> 10:09.760
You know, it's customary
to bring drunk people

10:09.920 --> 10:12.435
out of the bar.

10:14.440 --> 10:15.874
Yeah, bring him
to the store room.

10:18.360 --> 10:19.874
Come on,
I'll get some fresh towels.

10:20.040 --> 10:21.759
Come here.

10:30.120 --> 10:32.157
He's getting worse.
He needs a medic.

10:32.280 --> 10:34.590
- Okay, I'm on it.
- Hey, wh-what are you doing?

10:34.760 --> 10:36.433
All communications
are being monitored.

10:36.600 --> 10:38.671
- You should know that.
- Why?

10:38.840 --> 10:39.840
What do you mean?

10:40.360 --> 10:41.999
Seriously, you don't know?

10:43.160 --> 10:45.197
There was a failed
coup attempt.

10:46.520 --> 10:47.896
They're looking
for the conspirators.

10:47.920 --> 10:49.559
The whole city's on lockdown.

10:57.320 --> 10:58.320
See?

11:02.000 --> 11:04.799
They're saying that she
orchestrated the whole thing.

11:11.560 --> 11:12.391
It's a lie.

11:12.560 --> 11:14.199
My mother would never
betray the state.

11:14.400 --> 11:16.480
I'm just telling you what
the official line is, okay?

11:16.560 --> 11:18.440
They've rounded up everyone
else except for her,

11:18.480 --> 11:20.756
and I think they're
looking for you too.

11:23.160 --> 11:24.958
And there is one more thing.

11:25.160 --> 11:27.117
The lovely man that you
made me boot out of here,

11:27.280 --> 11:30.717
well, he works as a clerk
in the Tower of Justice.

11:30.880 --> 11:34.191
Apparently Nyssa-Vex
has been arrested.

11:34.360 --> 11:36.829
She's accused of being
part of the coup.

11:37.960 --> 11:39.633
Seg, they're gonna
execute her.

12:04.280 --> 12:05.316
Sorry.

12:06.400 --> 12:07.550
Hello, Adam.

12:07.720 --> 12:09.216
Is there something
I can help you with?

12:09.240 --> 12:11.038
Jesus H. Christ.

12:11.240 --> 12:13.296
Well, you can start by not
scaring the shit out of me

12:13.320 --> 12:16.597
- every time you enter the room.
- My apologies.

12:16.960 --> 12:18.952
That's the mechanism
that brought you here.

12:19.680 --> 12:21.751
Yeah, I need your help
to fix it.

12:21.920 --> 12:23.718
- It's urgent.
- Very well.

12:23.880 --> 12:25.917
I'll need to run
a structural analysis.

12:28.080 --> 12:29.230
Ah, ah, ah!

12:32.000 --> 12:33.798
Hmm, you seem
quite proficient

12:33.960 --> 12:35.599
with the operating systems.

12:35.840 --> 12:38.674
Well, I haven't unlocked
the adult movies yet,

12:38.840 --> 12:41.116
so your fortress
still holds some secrets.

12:44.360 --> 12:45.794
Where's Seg?

12:49.200 --> 12:50.236
No idea.

13:01.040 --> 13:05.319
Oh, I'd... I'd offer you a drink,
but what'd be the point?

13:05.600 --> 13:07.159
You're not a real boy.

13:09.400 --> 13:11.960
I appreciate
the tactful reminder.

13:12.320 --> 13:13.720
You seem quite distressed.

13:14.080 --> 13:15.640
Is there anything
I can assist you with?

13:15.800 --> 13:17.473
Oh, can you shoot lasers
from your eyes

13:17.640 --> 13:19.632
and bench press the Sun?

13:21.360 --> 13:23.352
I'm afraid that's beyond
my capabilities.

13:25.000 --> 13:27.196
Then just get
that damn thing working.

13:32.800 --> 13:34.200
Why is it so important?

13:35.800 --> 13:37.840
Because I gotta get the hell
out of here, all right?

13:38.000 --> 13:39.229
And where are you going?

13:48.800 --> 13:49.800
Home.

13:52.600 --> 13:54.432
The tissue's
badly damaged.

13:54.680 --> 13:56.240
His cells may not be able
to regenerate,

13:56.400 --> 13:59.438
but I'll do what I can.

14:00.080 --> 14:02.754
This will stabilize him
during the procedure.

14:07.720 --> 14:09.234
We need to find my mother.

14:10.240 --> 14:11.674
I'll get you
a change of clothes.

14:12.200 --> 14:13.316
Ven.

14:25.320 --> 14:26.356
What is it?

14:28.360 --> 14:29.360
Nyssa.

14:30.000 --> 14:30.717
They're gonna kill her.

14:30.880 --> 14:32.599
She's not your
responsibility.

14:33.680 --> 14:35.353
I can't just stand by
and do nothing.

14:35.560 --> 14:36.640
If you go up to the Guilds,

14:36.720 --> 14:38.560
you're putting your life
in unnecessary danger.

14:38.720 --> 14:39.920
So I'm supposed
to let her die?

14:40.000 --> 14:41.639
A Vex murdered
your grandfather.

14:41.800 --> 14:44.031
And a Zod
murdered my parents.

14:53.120 --> 14:59.356
Just tell me why you would
risk your life to save her.

15:00.120 --> 15:01.679
Because when I asked,

15:02.800 --> 15:04.917
she was willing to save yours.

15:11.760 --> 15:13.035
Just be careful.

15:14.200 --> 15:16.476
If I find my mother,
we meet back here.

15:40.840 --> 15:42.991
Your mother's favorite song.

15:43.320 --> 15:46.233
She always played it when you
had trouble getting to sleep.

15:47.320 --> 15:49.835
I always admired
your courage, Nyssa.

15:50.160 --> 15:51.480
As a child,

15:52.560 --> 15:56.600
nothing frightened you
except failure.

15:57.320 --> 16:01.075
That's why you
are my favorite.

16:01.560 --> 16:04.792
Please understand
I tried to protect you.

16:09.080 --> 16:11.117
But there is no other way.

16:15.440 --> 16:18.114
Call for help, and you die.

16:19.480 --> 16:21.676
<i>A curfew's in effect
for this sector.</i>

16:21.840 --> 16:24.116
<i>All unauthorized citizens
must return</i>

16:24.280 --> 16:26.795
<i>to their residences
immediately.</i>

16:28.120 --> 16:30.112
One by one,
search 'em out.

16:37.960 --> 16:38.960
It's me.

16:41.280 --> 16:42.350
Dev.

16:45.320 --> 16:46.720
What is going on?

16:47.440 --> 16:48.920
Sorry, I didn't mean
to scare you.

16:49.080 --> 16:50.514
What happened?

16:51.480 --> 16:54.154
Did my mother really try
to kill the Voice of Rao?

16:56.240 --> 16:57.240
Yes.

17:00.480 --> 17:02.756
- And I stood with her.
- Why?

17:02.920 --> 17:04.991
Because I've always
trusted her.

17:07.720 --> 17:10.359
- But something happened.
- What?

17:10.520 --> 17:14.355
We went to kill a man
and found a monster.

17:15.400 --> 17:17.392
An alien.
I-I don't know.

17:17.560 --> 17:20.233
Blasters were useless.
We didn't have a chance.

17:20.480 --> 17:21.709
Brainiac.

17:26.200 --> 17:28.031
You know who
this creature is?

17:29.440 --> 17:30.440
Yes.

17:33.720 --> 17:35.552
Has my mother
tried to contact you?

17:36.200 --> 17:37.714
I've been trying
to find her.

17:40.320 --> 17:42.152
Come with me.

17:43.240 --> 17:44.879
I might have an idea
where she is.

17:54.080 --> 17:55.196
Tell anyone about this,

17:55.360 --> 17:55.998
and you'll wish

17:56.120 --> 17:58.396
the Genesis Chamber
never spat you out.

18:09.760 --> 18:11.956
These should do the trick
for where we're going.

18:12.120 --> 18:13.315
Thanks.

18:19.320 --> 18:20.800
I'm glad you're with me.

18:25.600 --> 18:27.000
What's wrong?

18:28.800 --> 18:30.712
When I visited you
in your cell...

18:31.800 --> 18:33.200
you said you loved me.

18:36.080 --> 18:37.080
Do you really mean it?

18:37.160 --> 18:38.816
We've known each other
since we were children.

18:38.840 --> 18:41.116
- Of course I love you.
- That's not what I meant.

18:45.640 --> 18:48.314
I thought I was going to die.

18:49.520 --> 18:51.113
You were there for me.

18:52.600 --> 18:54.478
You've always been there
for me. I...

18:56.640 --> 19:01.192
I just wanted you to know
how much that means to me.

19:09.320 --> 19:10.640
Thank you.

19:12.200 --> 19:13.600
For what?

19:14.160 --> 19:15.833
Caring enough to lie.

19:18.680 --> 19:19.750
Come on.

19:26.600 --> 19:28.176
Up until the moment
you pulled the trigger,

19:28.200 --> 19:29.656
I didn't really think
you would do it.

19:29.680 --> 19:31.136
- Nyssa, please, I... I can...
- Shut up!

19:31.160 --> 19:32.753
You don't get to talk.

19:35.840 --> 19:40.312
All my life, I have watched
you betray and destroy

19:40.480 --> 19:42.119
everyone around you.

19:42.320 --> 19:44.437
But I always held up hope
that I was different.

19:44.560 --> 19:46.597
- You are.
- I actually fooled myself

19:46.800 --> 19:49.918
into believing that in your own
way you might actually love me.

19:50.120 --> 19:51.160
I do.
I do love you, Nyssa.

19:51.320 --> 19:54.313
I gave up everything
to please you.

19:54.760 --> 19:57.434
I sacrificed my friendships,

19:57.600 --> 20:00.160
my morality,
even my own ambition!

20:00.320 --> 20:03.870
You molded me to be your
perfect political ally.

20:04.040 --> 20:06.160
I taught you the skills
you needed to survive in th...

20:06.200 --> 20:07.520
No!

20:07.720 --> 20:10.440
You taught me how
to manipulate people,

20:10.640 --> 20:13.678
then discard them when they've
outlived their usefulness.

20:16.080 --> 20:18.197
I learned that lesson well.

20:18.400 --> 20:20.039
<i>It doesn't matter
if she's under arrest.</i>

20:20.200 --> 20:22.216
As her intended, I have
every right to speak with her.

20:22.240 --> 20:24.277
Take it up with
the Lawmakers Guild.

20:26.760 --> 20:28.638
If you touch me with
that thing one more time,

20:28.800 --> 20:30.176
I'm gonna shove it
so far up your ass,

20:30.200 --> 20:33.432
you're gonna taste it.

20:37.360 --> 20:38.919
Yes, Magistrate?

20:40.880 --> 20:42.280
You can go in.

20:44.080 --> 20:46.231
You killed my grandfather
when he tried to warn you

20:46.360 --> 20:47.680
about Brainiac.

20:47.840 --> 20:50.196
And now you are
working for him.

20:50.360 --> 20:53.114
- I had no choice.
- There's always a choice.

20:53.320 --> 20:54.440
You just made the wrong one.

20:54.560 --> 20:56.552
How's he gonna take the city?

20:56.800 --> 20:57.936
I don't know what
you're talking about.

20:59.640 --> 21:03.031
Your new master is going
to rip Kandor from the ground

21:03.240 --> 21:04.913
and enslave all of us.

21:05.120 --> 21:07.715
I need to know how he's going
to do it so I can stop him.

21:08.360 --> 21:11.558
I have no idea.

21:11.760 --> 21:13.433
And even if it were true,

21:13.600 --> 21:15.456
you're deluding yourself
if you think you have the power

21:15.480 --> 21:16.480
to stop him.

21:16.680 --> 21:19.354
Better to live under his rule
than to die.

21:19.520 --> 21:21.352
Coward.
You won't live to see it.

21:21.520 --> 21:24.035
Killing me won't get you
past the guards.

21:24.200 --> 21:25.953
- I can help you.
- We'll take our chances.

21:26.120 --> 21:27.395
Think this through, Nyssa!

21:27.560 --> 21:28.936
Even if somehow you leave
this room alive,

21:28.960 --> 21:30.872
you won't get out
of the Guilded Area.

21:31.040 --> 21:32.713
The Sagitari know
you're a traitor.

21:32.880 --> 21:34.872
You won't even make it
down the hallway.

21:35.200 --> 21:37.431
- You need me.
- Not anymore.

21:37.760 --> 21:39.877
Wait.
I want him dead

21:40.040 --> 21:41.713
just as much as you do.

21:43.760 --> 21:44.830
But he's right.

21:45.120 --> 21:46.998
We're gonna need him
to get out of here.

21:47.200 --> 21:48.520
If those guards
hear blaster fire,

21:48.560 --> 21:49.755
they're gonna be all over us.

21:50.880 --> 21:51.950
Trust me.

21:53.320 --> 21:54.993
His time will come.

22:02.680 --> 22:03.875
Thank you.

22:07.120 --> 22:08.474
Guards, guards, come quick...

22:56.280 --> 22:58.920
I was an idiot
to think I could save him.

22:59.080 --> 23:01.311
- Who?
- Big blue, the Boy Scout,

23:01.480 --> 23:03.915
the Man of Steel.

23:05.440 --> 23:07.671
God, he's got
a lot of nicknames.

23:07.880 --> 23:09.519
You know why?

23:09.680 --> 23:11.637
He's a hero.

23:11.800 --> 23:13.792
Heroes get nicknames.

23:13.960 --> 23:15.679
What was your nickname?

23:19.120 --> 23:20.952
I don't have one.

23:21.240 --> 23:23.914
You said you're a great
hero of your planet.

23:25.840 --> 23:26.876
I lied.

23:28.080 --> 23:30.276
Apparently, that's
my superpower... lying.

23:30.640 --> 23:33.075
No, I'm a wannabe.
D-lister.

23:34.160 --> 23:36.038
Can't fly,
have no super strength,

23:36.200 --> 23:37.270
no power ring.

23:37.440 --> 23:38.880
No, the only thing
I had going for me

23:39.000 --> 23:42.357
was that Zeta-Beam device,
and now that's broken.

23:43.120 --> 23:44.679
God, I suck.

23:49.160 --> 23:51.080
So you making any progress
on this thing or what?

23:51.120 --> 23:52.679
I gotta get out of here.

23:52.840 --> 23:54.479
Why are you in such a hurry?

23:54.640 --> 23:57.200
You know, you ask
a lot of questions.

23:57.360 --> 23:58.400
You sure you're not a cop?

24:01.600 --> 24:03.440
No, your grandson doesn't
want me here anymore.

24:06.200 --> 24:10.558
But you came here to help us
save our world.

24:10.760 --> 24:14.356
- Why would Seg...
- Because I... screwed up.

24:15.360 --> 24:16.589
Again.

24:17.960 --> 24:19.997
So I'm going back
to Earth to...

24:23.440 --> 24:25.955
Send someone
with a goddamn nickname.

24:35.160 --> 24:37.152
Black Zero.
They're in there.

24:38.200 --> 24:39.429
Search the room!

24:45.280 --> 24:47.511
Hey, you can get us
out of here, right?

24:48.520 --> 24:49.590
This way.

25:16.000 --> 25:17.878
She was definitely here!

25:41.880 --> 25:43.872
It's good to see you, Dev.

25:44.040 --> 25:47.078
I feared I was
the only one to escape.

25:47.240 --> 25:49.038
You were, Primus.

25:57.120 --> 25:59.430
But I'm here
to correct that mistake.

25:59.600 --> 26:00.954
What has he done to you?

26:01.160 --> 26:04.153
He showed me the wonders
of the universe,

26:04.360 --> 26:06.636
knowledge I never
knew existed,

26:06.840 --> 26:08.797
things you can't
even imagine.

26:09.000 --> 26:11.879
He's made me better,
given me purpose.

26:12.080 --> 26:13.434
And what is that?

26:13.600 --> 26:17.355
To serve something greater
than weak and flawed leaders.

26:17.520 --> 26:20.831
I serve a being who
has power over death.

26:21.000 --> 26:23.469
With him, there will be
no more pain,

26:23.880 --> 26:25.109
no more suffering.

26:25.520 --> 26:29.309
Imagine never having
to lose anyone ever again.

26:30.280 --> 26:32.033
Come with me back to Kandor.

26:32.480 --> 26:34.153
He will show you.

26:34.440 --> 26:37.353
He will open your minds
the way he has mine.

26:37.520 --> 26:39.000
And if we don't?

26:44.600 --> 26:46.080
Then you will die here!

27:07.600 --> 27:10.069
- Are you hurt?
- I'm fine.

27:16.960 --> 27:19.600
You did what had to be done.

27:29.000 --> 27:30.719
You've failed.

27:32.000 --> 27:34.993
How... unsurprising.

27:35.640 --> 27:37.120
I swear...

27:37.840 --> 27:41.038
I had every intention
of carrying out your orders.

27:41.400 --> 27:43.357
I know you did.

27:43.520 --> 27:47.400
If I sensed even for a moment
that you were lying,

27:47.880 --> 27:49.712
you'd already be dead.

27:50.720 --> 27:53.030
You may keep your life...

27:54.800 --> 27:55.800
for now.

28:06.200 --> 28:07.600
Your Eminence...

28:08.360 --> 28:11.637
there is one other matter
I would like to address.

28:11.760 --> 28:14.150
The end of the Nova Cycle
celebration.

28:14.320 --> 28:15.320
What of it?

28:15.400 --> 28:17.551
If appearances
are to be maintained,

28:17.720 --> 28:20.952
you must extinguish
the Flame of Rebirth tonight.

28:21.600 --> 28:22.954
The people will expect it,

28:23.120 --> 28:24.918
along with the
customary benediction.

28:25.040 --> 28:28.078
Failure to do so
would only raise questions.

28:28.440 --> 28:29.954
Very well.

28:31.800 --> 28:33.678
I will double
your security detail.

28:33.880 --> 28:35.030
There's no need.

28:52.240 --> 28:55.916
The Red Shard.
My new guardians.

28:56.120 --> 28:59.830
And loyal only to me.

29:05.080 --> 29:07.072
You and Seg knew about this
creature all along?

29:07.280 --> 29:09.216
Why didn't you tell me?
I could have done something.

29:09.240 --> 29:12.074
Because talk of aliens
condemned you to the ice.

29:12.280 --> 29:14.158
And would you have
believed me even if I did?

29:15.280 --> 29:16.280
No.

29:19.440 --> 29:20.715
I'm sorry, Lyta.

29:23.720 --> 29:26.519
I should have had
more faith in you.

29:28.200 --> 29:30.590
Yes, you should have.

29:31.760 --> 29:33.797
There's one thing
I need to understand.

29:34.040 --> 29:36.919
If you didn't know Brainiac
had corrupted the Voice of Rao,

29:37.120 --> 29:39.760
then why even attempt a coup?

29:40.040 --> 29:42.680
It betrays everything
you have taught me...

29:42.880 --> 29:46.191
every single principle
House Zod stands for.

29:53.640 --> 29:57.031
Because Daron-Vex
and his daughter...

29:58.160 --> 30:02.393
offered to spare your life
in exchange for my help.

30:04.400 --> 30:08.679
It was a choice between
my honor and my only child.

30:11.360 --> 30:13.079
I chose you.

30:18.280 --> 30:20.590
And I would do it again.

30:23.920 --> 30:25.639
But all that matters now

30:26.560 --> 30:29.200
is that we stop this creature.

30:29.360 --> 30:31.875
We need to mount a resistance.

30:32.600 --> 30:33.954
We need warriors.

30:37.880 --> 30:40.076
There's someone
I need you to meet.

30:49.520 --> 30:52.160
Um...

30:52.440 --> 30:55.717
Sorry, you are gonna pay
for his services, right?

30:56.800 --> 30:58.837
We'll talk about it later.

31:04.200 --> 31:06.396
Your resiliency
is impressive.

31:06.560 --> 31:08.313
I come from good stock.

31:10.680 --> 31:11.909
Okay.

31:17.440 --> 31:18.920
Who's your father?

31:25.600 --> 31:26.920
Are you sure
you want to know?

31:34.400 --> 31:35.834
I never knew him.

31:36.080 --> 31:37.639
Just that he was a soldier

31:37.800 --> 31:40.474
and he was killed in
the battle for Kandor.

31:43.160 --> 31:44.913
Mother, we need to find Seg.

31:49.400 --> 31:50.550
Let's go.

31:58.760 --> 32:00.240
So far so good.

32:00.400 --> 32:02.119
We just need to get
back to the tavern.

32:02.280 --> 32:04.112
Next time we steal uniforms
off of dead guys,

32:04.280 --> 32:06.256
could you please make sure
I go for the larger one?

32:06.280 --> 32:07.720
- Why?
- Those trousers are so tight,

32:07.840 --> 32:09.433
I nearly castrated myself.

32:10.760 --> 32:11.591
Rao forbid.

32:11.760 --> 32:12.557
By the way,
where'd you learn to fight

32:12.720 --> 32:13.720
like that?

32:16.480 --> 32:18.199
A lover in
the Military Guild.

32:18.440 --> 32:19.590
Combat instructor.

32:19.760 --> 32:21.480
She wasn't so faithful,
but she did teach me

32:21.560 --> 32:23.677
how to defend myself.

32:27.960 --> 32:29.110
Okay, we should get moving.

32:33.000 --> 32:34.070
What is it?

32:35.920 --> 32:37.195
Uh...

32:38.680 --> 32:41.912
I'm not very good at this.

32:42.680 --> 32:45.479
Thank you for putting
your life on the line for me.

32:45.640 --> 32:47.757
- It was stupid, but...
- Wow, you're really not very

32:47.920 --> 32:49.036
good at this, are you?

32:50.960 --> 32:52.640
It's just not something
I expect for anyone

32:52.760 --> 32:53.876
to do for me.

32:54.280 --> 32:56.431
And it's not something
I think I deserve...

32:57.600 --> 32:59.080
especially from you.

33:01.520 --> 33:03.273
You really need
to lighten up.

33:06.360 --> 33:08.511
Maybe you can teach me.

33:17.760 --> 33:19.240
It's them!
Take them!

33:20.560 --> 33:21.560
- Run!
- Go, go, go!

33:26.560 --> 33:28.836
<i>Sector has curfew in effect.</i>

33:29.000 --> 33:32.357
<i>Unless authorized, please
return to your residence.</i>

33:46.600 --> 33:48.159
Why align yourself
with Black Zero?

33:48.320 --> 33:49.913
Why not come
straight to us?

33:51.240 --> 33:52.896
I needed access to weapons
and a fighting force.

33:52.920 --> 33:54.434
It was the most efficient way.

33:54.600 --> 33:57.320
Besides, I don't think you
would have exactly

33:57.520 --> 33:59.239
welcomed me with open arms.

34:06.600 --> 34:09.592
As Zods, we swear an oath
to protect our people.

34:10.239 --> 34:11.960
You took actions that
resulted in the deaths

34:12.080 --> 34:13.400
of innocent Kandorians.

34:13.560 --> 34:15.870
I regret all lives lost.

34:16.159 --> 34:17.992
But it was necessary
to maintain my cover.

34:18.239 --> 34:19.639
I fight for more
than just a city.

34:19.800 --> 34:21.234
I fight for all of Krypton.

34:21.400 --> 34:23.176
And the lives of a few
is a small price to pay

34:23.199 --> 34:25.078
to save an entire world.

34:26.880 --> 34:30.112
As a Zod,
you should understand that.

34:34.320 --> 34:35.800
Nyssa, no, no, no, no, no,
wait!

34:36.360 --> 34:37.735
Come on, come on, come on.

34:37.760 --> 34:38.760
Shit.

34:39.560 --> 34:40.560
Get on your knees.

34:40.639 --> 34:41.994
Hands behind your head now.

34:42.120 --> 34:43.315
I'm the one you want,
okay?

34:43.480 --> 34:44.914
He's done nothing wrong.
Let him go.

34:45.080 --> 34:46.309
No one's going anywhere.

34:46.520 --> 34:48.318
On authority
of the Voice of Rao...

34:50.280 --> 34:51.918
Why are you smiling?

34:52.159 --> 34:54.000
'Cause you're about to get
punched in the face.

34:59.240 --> 35:00.656
You'll never be more
attractive to me

35:00.680 --> 35:02.034
than you are
in this moment.

35:03.560 --> 35:04.960
We need to move.

35:05.520 --> 35:06.556
Yeah.

35:09.840 --> 35:12.594
- She doesn't belong here.
- Lyta's right.

35:12.760 --> 35:14.672
She's an opportunist,
just like her father.

35:14.880 --> 35:16.872
She'll betray us at the first
chance she gets.

35:17.040 --> 35:18.554
You're wrong.
We can trust her.

35:18.760 --> 35:19.760
Why should we trust her?

35:19.880 --> 35:21.599
Because none
of our hands are clean!

35:29.760 --> 35:32.116
And we are going
to need each other

35:32.800 --> 35:34.598
if we're gonna defeat Brainiac.

35:35.160 --> 35:37.038
If you can't trust her...

35:39.040 --> 35:40.235
Then trust me.

35:45.000 --> 35:46.798
So, what are we
going to do?

35:47.000 --> 35:48.354
We need to raise an army.

35:48.520 --> 35:51.638
We can go to Kryptonopolis,
establish a base there,

35:51.880 --> 35:55.271
reach out to other city-states,
and return in force.

35:55.480 --> 35:56.709
My sisters live there.

35:56.920 --> 35:58.656
They can provide us with those
resources and connections

35:58.680 --> 36:00.399
- we need.
- There's no time.

36:00.520 --> 36:02.876
Brainiac's gonna take the city
in a matter of weeks.

36:03.080 --> 36:04.878
We must stay and fight!

36:05.040 --> 36:07.316
We will not stand a chance.

36:07.480 --> 36:09.039
He controls the Sagitari.

36:09.240 --> 36:11.516
If we attempt this ourselves,
we'll be slaughtered.

36:11.720 --> 36:12.720
Then so be it.

36:12.840 --> 36:14.479
If we are going to die,
then at least...

36:14.640 --> 36:15.736
I'm just gonna
stop you there.

36:15.760 --> 36:18.400
Um, I don't wanna die, so...

36:19.040 --> 36:20.040
There's another way.

36:21.320 --> 36:22.879
The Nova Cycle celebration.

36:23.480 --> 36:24.755
That's how we get our army.

36:26.920 --> 36:28.240
Not with that.
Our weapons have no

36:28.280 --> 36:29.856
- effect on him.
- They might not harm him,

36:29.880 --> 36:31.360
but they will piss him off...

36:31.760 --> 36:34.116
when everyone was
gonna be watching.

36:34.360 --> 36:37.319
If we can provoke him into
revealing his true nature,

36:37.480 --> 36:41.030
if we can show the people
that the Voice of Rao

36:41.200 --> 36:43.032
is an alien creature,

36:43.240 --> 36:45.277
the entire city will rise

36:45.440 --> 36:47.113
and stand against him.

36:47.240 --> 36:50.153
We will have our army.

36:53.600 --> 36:54.716
Well, I believe

36:54.880 --> 36:56.394
I found the problem.

36:56.800 --> 36:57.870
You're shitting me.

36:58.200 --> 37:00.954
That's repulsive,
and I most certainly am not.

37:01.160 --> 37:04.551
No, the device's photonic
discharge cells were damaged.

37:04.800 --> 37:06.234
Well, can you fix it?

37:06.400 --> 37:07.720
I already have.

37:10.120 --> 37:11.120
So...

37:14.080 --> 37:16.640
- I can leave?
- If that's your choice.

37:19.840 --> 37:22.435
But tell me something first.

37:22.840 --> 37:26.311
If you're not a real hero,
as you claim to be,

37:27.360 --> 37:29.431
Why'd you come here
in the first place?

37:31.120 --> 37:32.998
Because I thought
I could become one.

37:33.160 --> 37:35.391
I thought that if I could
just save Superman,

37:35.560 --> 37:37.216
then the Justice League
would have to notice me

37:37.240 --> 37:38.993
and maybe even people
would look up to me.

37:39.200 --> 37:42.079
And maybe, just maybe,
when I look in that mirror,

37:42.280 --> 37:44.920
I wouldn't see a loser
staring back at me.

37:45.680 --> 37:46.875
That's all gone now.

37:49.240 --> 37:52.278
Whatever happened between you
and Seg can be fixed.

37:52.440 --> 37:53.874
He may be stubborn,

37:54.080 --> 37:57.676
but he knows a true friend
when he finds one.

37:58.680 --> 38:01.320
Ah, there's no fixing this.

38:01.680 --> 38:02.955
Adam, Adam.

38:04.800 --> 38:06.519
No matter what you
think about yourself,

38:06.720 --> 38:08.552
being a hero is not about...

38:10.040 --> 38:11.633
It's not about strength
or having

38:11.800 --> 38:13.598
extraordinary capabilities.

38:14.120 --> 38:19.240
It's about making the decision
to help others.

38:19.840 --> 38:22.071
Now, regardless of the reason,

38:22.520 --> 38:24.477
you chose to come here.

38:24.760 --> 38:27.070
You can still set things right.

38:27.480 --> 38:28.480
Hmm?

38:31.720 --> 38:33.757
- You're right.
- Mm.

38:33.880 --> 38:35.678
I can.

38:38.800 --> 38:41.190
There's something here
I still need to do.

38:41.400 --> 38:42.595
And what's that?

38:42.840 --> 38:45.878
Kill General Zod and prevent
Seg from saving Kandor.

38:46.080 --> 38:47.080
I don't understand.

38:47.160 --> 38:48.879
You won't have to.

38:49.160 --> 38:50.656
- What are you doing?
- Erasing all record

38:50.680 --> 38:51.680
of this conversation.

38:57.000 --> 38:58.036
Hello, Adam.

38:58.200 --> 39:00.271
Is there something
I can help you with?

39:01.240 --> 39:02.993
Piss off, ghost.

39:03.760 --> 39:04.760
Adam.

39:08.000 --> 39:10.117
We receive
the gift of light.

39:10.320 --> 39:13.233
From Rao,
all blessings flow.

39:13.400 --> 39:15.357
We receive
the gift of light.

39:15.520 --> 39:17.910
His radiance gives us life.

39:18.160 --> 39:20.117
We receive
the gift of light.

39:20.280 --> 39:22.511
His magnificence fills our...

39:41.080 --> 39:44.630
His Eminence will now
conclude the proceedings.

40:01.520 --> 40:02.636
On a three count.

40:04.920 --> 40:07.913
It is through fire
that we are reborn.

40:09.440 --> 40:12.877
It cleanses and purifies.

40:13.160 --> 40:16.631
- One...
- Taking away all misdeeds.

40:16.800 --> 40:19.076
- Two...
- Making us worthy

40:19.200 --> 40:23.035
of the mercy that Rao
has bestowed upon us.

40:23.200 --> 40:24.680
This creature...

40:24.840 --> 40:26.399
Don't shoot.
Don't shoot.

40:26.560 --> 40:28.119
- Is deceiving you!
- This is heresy!

40:28.320 --> 40:30.312
This thing is not
a prophet of Rao.

40:30.480 --> 40:32.949
- Remove her!
- He's not even a man!

40:33.960 --> 40:36.714
No. Let her be.

40:37.440 --> 40:38.440
She's right.

40:39.600 --> 40:44.959
I have transcended
into something more.

41:06.600 --> 41:09.069
Your faith has been rewarded.

41:09.720 --> 41:12.360
I have come to lift you
out of despair

41:12.520 --> 41:15.240
and make your city whole.

41:15.400 --> 41:17.153
From this moment forward,

41:17.320 --> 41:19.437
the divide between
Guilded and Rankless

41:19.640 --> 41:21.472
will be no more.

41:21.640 --> 41:25.236
All will prosper and thrive.

41:25.560 --> 41:29.110
And because of your devotion,
I will lead you to a place

41:29.280 --> 41:31.158
of eternal life.

41:31.800 --> 41:33.871
You will become immortal.

41:34.520 --> 41:36.432
Now speak with one voice.

41:36.600 --> 41:39.354
Who wants to live forever?
