WEBVTT

00:02.960 --> 00:04.920
JARED COLLINS:
I cannot wait to see this.

00:04.920 --> 00:05.880
GIORGIO A. TSOUKALOS:
Pretty amazing.

00:05.880 --> 00:06.960
COLLINS:
Waiting for a long time.

00:06.960 --> 00:09.210
I mean, it's almost unheard of.

00:09.210 --> 00:11.220
I have never seen one in person.

00:13.130 --> 00:14.130
Wow.

00:14.130 --> 00:15.550
Incredible.

00:15.550 --> 00:17.390
That is freaky.

00:17.390 --> 00:18.930
It's odd, right?

00:18.930 --> 00:21.850
NARRATOR:
Are extraterrestrial artifacts

00:21.850 --> 00:24.770
being dismissed by scholars?

00:24.770 --> 00:26.940
TSOUKALOS:
This object had a date of

00:26.940 --> 00:29.820
140 million years.

00:29.820 --> 00:33.400
NARRATOR: Is our scientific
process flawed?

00:33.400 --> 00:36.740
DAVID CHILDRESS: Scientists are
far too quick to put a period

00:36.740 --> 00:39.540
at the end of the sentence
and this is a problem.

00:39.540 --> 00:43.910
NARRATOR: Will we be forced
to rewrite our history books?

00:43.910 --> 00:45.710
DAVID WILCOCK:
The findings are undeniable.

00:45.710 --> 00:47.500
We are not alone.

00:47.500 --> 00:49.040
Extraterrestrial,
human‐like groups

00:49.040 --> 00:51.130
have been visiting us all along.

00:51.130 --> 00:53.470
Looks amazing.

00:53.470 --> 00:55.380
♪ ♪

01:27.420 --> 01:29.460
NARRATOR:
New York City.

01:29.460 --> 01:33.670
February 2017.

01:33.670 --> 01:37.630
At New York University,
Giorgio Tsoukalos meets

01:37.630 --> 01:40.430
with art collector Jared
Collins, who is in possession

01:40.430 --> 01:43.390
of a 2,000‐year‐old
elongated skull.

01:43.390 --> 01:44.850
TSOUKALOS: Oh.

01:44.850 --> 01:46.560
Wow.

01:46.560 --> 01:48.440
That is fantastic.

01:48.440 --> 01:52.690
NARRATOR: The skull is
incredibly well‐preserved

01:52.690 --> 01:56.820
and Jared is having it tested
at the university to find out

01:56.820 --> 02:00.450
if it might possibly contain
abnormalities that indicate

02:00.450 --> 02:02.780
it is something
other than human.

02:02.780 --> 02:07.620
He agreed to meet Giorgio
outside of the Anthropology Lab

02:07.620 --> 02:09.750
for a first look at the skull.

02:09.750 --> 02:11.340
So, how did this come to be
in your possession?

02:11.340 --> 02:12.590
COLLINS:
Well, it's not actually mine.

02:12.590 --> 02:14.250
It is on loan to me.

02:14.250 --> 02:16.010
Me and one of my colleagues

02:16.010 --> 02:18.720
contacted a museum
and we asked them,

02:18.720 --> 02:21.350
"Do you have an elongated skull
in your collection?"

02:21.350 --> 02:24.100
And they said they have
just one, this one.

02:24.100 --> 02:26.930
TSOUKALOS: And have they
told you anything about it?

02:26.930 --> 02:28.640
‐COLLINS: Actually...
‐TSOUKALOS: Like the provenance?

02:28.640 --> 02:30.270
COLLINS:
Strangely,

02:30.270 --> 02:32.810
this has been in storage
for decades.

02:32.810 --> 02:35.480
They have never tested it.

02:35.480 --> 02:37.280
They had very little
information on it.

02:37.280 --> 02:40.280
They know it's
absolutely Paracas.

02:40.280 --> 02:41.820
TSOUKALOS:
So, this skull was found

02:41.820 --> 02:43.990
‐in the Paracas region of Peru.
‐That's right.

02:43.990 --> 02:47.160
But no real modern testing
has ever been done on this.

02:47.160 --> 02:48.660
Oh, this is amazing.

02:48.660 --> 02:50.750
So, let's go, right?

02:50.750 --> 02:52.460
Okay.

02:55.670 --> 02:57.460
NARRATOR:
NYU Professor of Anthropology

02:57.460 --> 03:00.430
Dr. Todd Disotell

03:00.430 --> 03:03.180
agreed to conduct
a forensic evaluation

03:03.180 --> 03:04.970
of the elongated skull.

03:04.970 --> 03:08.020
I've seen casts;
I've never seen one in person.

03:08.020 --> 03:10.810
‐Okay.
‐Wow.

03:10.810 --> 03:14.900
That is... freaky.

03:14.900 --> 03:17.940
I mean, I just can't come up
with another term.

03:17.940 --> 03:20.110
I love that your first reaction
is that it's freaky,

03:20.110 --> 03:21.570
'cause I agree with you.

03:21.570 --> 03:22.820
Well, I mean, look at it.
That's...

03:22.820 --> 03:23.820
TSOUKALOS:
It's‐it's quite bizarre.

03:23.820 --> 03:26.450
TODD DISOTELL:
I can see that

03:26.450 --> 03:29.290
this is a relatively
young individual.

03:29.290 --> 03:30.830
And how did you determine that,
for example?

03:30.830 --> 03:32.670
Well, so, by looking
at the teeth.

03:32.670 --> 03:36.710
We have some deciduous,
or some baby teeth, remaining.

03:36.710 --> 03:39.760
It doesn't yet have
its third molar,

03:39.760 --> 03:43.720
which typically comes in
around 18 years old or so.

03:43.720 --> 03:46.600
So, I‐I would guess that this

03:46.600 --> 03:49.350
is somewhere maybe
12 to 14 years old.

03:49.350 --> 03:50.980
Really?

03:50.980 --> 03:54.350
DISOTELL: Um, let me just,
uh, move it over

03:54.350 --> 03:57.270
‐to the sterile bench surface.
‐Mm‐hmm.

03:57.270 --> 04:00.320
DISOTELL: Wow.
So, it's very fascinating.

04:00.320 --> 04:02.780
‐Besides the shape.
‐(all chuckle)

04:02.780 --> 04:04.780
The sagittal suture

04:04.780 --> 04:09.490
looks like it has
completely fused.

04:09.490 --> 04:11.370
If it's an adolescent,
maybe 12 years old,

04:11.370 --> 04:13.420
isn't that quite young
to have a‐a fusion so...

04:13.420 --> 04:15.500
DISOTELL:
It is, but...

04:15.500 --> 04:17.210
‐I'm holding it, I'm looking
at it. ‐COLLINS: Yeah, yeah.

04:17.210 --> 04:20.090
DISOTELL: And it's just been
completely obliterated.

04:20.090 --> 04:23.380
NARRATOR:
The sagittal suture is the seam

04:23.380 --> 04:27.720
where the two parietal bones
of the skull come together.

04:27.720 --> 04:32.770
Although the markings may be
faint due to fusing over time,

04:32.770 --> 04:35.350
all human skulls are expected

04:35.350 --> 04:38.730
to have some evidence
of this feature,

04:38.730 --> 04:42.690
so it is curious
that this skull does not,

04:42.690 --> 04:46.320
nor do the skulls of a number
of other mysterious specimens

04:46.320 --> 04:51.580
that have been collected and
examined by various experts.

04:51.580 --> 04:54.870
One of the great enigmas
of planet Earth

04:54.870 --> 04:57.130
is that all over the world

04:57.130 --> 05:01.130
we find skeletons with people

05:01.130 --> 05:05.590
having these elongated skulls.

05:05.590 --> 05:10.310
NARRATOR: For centuries, various
native cultures have engaged

05:10.310 --> 05:11.930
in the ritual practice

05:11.930 --> 05:14.940
of artificially
elongating their skulls

05:14.940 --> 05:18.940
by tightly wrapping the heads of
their children through infancy.

05:18.940 --> 05:22.900
However, these skulls
still feature evidence

05:22.900 --> 05:25.700
of the cranial sutures.

05:25.700 --> 05:28.450
CHILDRESS: You also have
the whole speculation

05:28.450 --> 05:31.280
of why people were doing
the head binding

05:31.280 --> 05:33.910
and the artificial
elongation anyway.

05:33.910 --> 05:35.460
Why were they doing that?

05:35.460 --> 05:38.580
They wanted to have
these elongated skulls

05:38.580 --> 05:41.750
and to them
it represented the elite,

05:41.750 --> 05:44.920
the gods, the rulers.

05:44.920 --> 05:49.760
And you have to wonder if
there was a race here on Earth

05:49.760 --> 05:54.020
with these elongated heads and
were they extraterrestrials?

05:54.020 --> 05:57.810
Okay, let's move on

05:57.810 --> 06:00.860
to extracting some tooth
and bone powder

06:00.860 --> 06:02.900
to get DNA out of that.

06:02.900 --> 06:05.490
‐Okay. Excellent.
‐Yeah.

06:05.490 --> 06:07.070
NARRATOR:
In order to obtain

06:07.070 --> 06:10.450
the needed genetic material
from the artifact,

06:10.450 --> 06:15.120
Dr. Disotell will need to remove
a tooth and drill into it

06:15.120 --> 06:16.870
to extract the samples.

06:16.870 --> 06:20.380
The analysis of the material
will determine the sex,

06:20.380 --> 06:24.420
ancestral lineage of both
the father and the mother,

06:24.420 --> 06:27.260
and any DNA anomalies
when compared

06:27.260 --> 06:30.090
with the current
human genetic database.

06:32.180 --> 06:34.760
Looks pretty good.

06:34.760 --> 06:39.940
So, we will pack this up
and send it off

06:39.940 --> 06:42.270
and in four to six weeks,
they should have the result.

06:42.270 --> 06:44.110
TSOUKALOS:
Four to six weeks, okay.

06:44.110 --> 06:46.440
Thank you very much, really
appreciate your input on this.

06:46.440 --> 06:47.740
‐DISOTELL: Take care, gentlemen.
‐You got it. ‐Thanks a lot.

06:50.280 --> 06:53.330
NARRATOR: For hundreds of years,
researchers have been confronted

06:53.330 --> 06:57.290
with numerous
scientific anomalies.

06:57.290 --> 07:01.790
But traditional science
is often intolerant of evidence

07:01.790 --> 07:06.050
that doesn't fit neatly
within accepted frameworks.

07:06.050 --> 07:08.470
Because of these prejudices,

07:08.470 --> 07:10.880
could we be missing
a greater truth

07:10.880 --> 07:15.100
about mankind's origins?

07:15.100 --> 07:19.430
TSOUKALOS: I think scientists
need to look at these things,

07:19.430 --> 07:22.900
and instead of just dismissing
it offhand right away,

07:22.900 --> 07:25.360
to be like, wait a second.

07:25.360 --> 07:26.860
Maybe we are not the first.

07:26.860 --> 07:29.780
Maybe another civilization
did exist.

07:29.780 --> 07:33.110
Perhaps there is an
extraterrestrial connection.

07:33.110 --> 07:35.580
Because clearly we have
a mystery there

07:35.580 --> 07:36.950
and everybody's
looking the other way.

07:41.870 --> 07:45.170
NARRATOR:
Glen Rose, Texas.

07:45.170 --> 07:47.500
This rural, southern town

07:47.500 --> 07:51.170
has a population of only 2,500,

07:51.170 --> 07:53.390
but may hold one of the most

07:53.390 --> 07:58.010
incredible archaeological
artifacts ever found.

07:58.010 --> 08:02.020
At the Creation Evidence Museum

08:02.020 --> 08:06.440
is an ancient hammer known
as the "London Artifact,"

08:06.440 --> 08:08.570
named after
the central Texas town

08:08.570 --> 08:12.400
where it was discovered in 1936.

08:12.400 --> 08:16.280
The hammer itself was found
in the Travis Formation.

08:16.280 --> 08:19.040
It's a concretion of sandstone.

08:19.040 --> 08:22.330
And it usually takes about a 140
million years for this to form.

08:22.330 --> 08:25.080
That would put it
at 140 million years old.

08:25.080 --> 08:28.840
NARRATOR:
Mainstream scientists contend

08:28.840 --> 08:34.680
that the first modern humans
emerged only 200,000 years ago.

08:34.680 --> 08:39.640
But if so, how is it possible
that such an artifact exists?

08:39.640 --> 08:44.890
The hammer was scientifically
analyzed in the 1980s

08:44.890 --> 08:47.190
by two independent labs,

08:47.190 --> 08:50.650
the Creation Science Foundation
based in Australia

08:50.650 --> 08:54.990
and the Batelle Memorial
Laboratory in Columbus, Ohio.

08:54.990 --> 08:58.990
Incredibly, both labs
concluded that the hammer

08:58.990 --> 09:02.950
could indeed be
over 100 million years old.

09:02.950 --> 09:05.080
Part of the handle, actually,

09:05.080 --> 09:08.130
is starting to go through a
process called coalification.

09:08.130 --> 09:11.000
It's where you have inorganic
material and organic material

09:11.000 --> 09:12.960
changing into coal.

09:12.960 --> 09:14.760
This is something that
just simply can't happen

09:14.760 --> 09:17.140
in the span of, say,
a hundred years.

09:17.140 --> 09:19.300
Like most people saying,
"Oh, this is nothing more

09:19.300 --> 09:20.890
"than a hammer
that was left behind

09:20.890 --> 09:24.020
by a would‐be prospector
from the mid‐1800s."

09:26.810 --> 09:29.270
NARRATOR:
In addition to coalification,

09:29.270 --> 09:34.110
the handle of the hammer
shows signs of petrification.

09:34.110 --> 09:36.570
This process of the organic wood

09:36.570 --> 09:38.950
being replaced
by mineral crystals

09:38.950 --> 09:41.120
takes millions of years.

09:41.120 --> 09:45.620
Test results concluded that
the material on the hammerhead

09:45.620 --> 09:51.170
consisted of 96.6% iron,
2.6% chlorine

09:51.170 --> 09:54.380
and less than one percent
sulfur.

09:54.380 --> 09:58.340
Incredibly, this material
contained no carbon

09:58.340 --> 10:01.050
to indicate
modern manufacturing.

10:01.050 --> 10:05.350
JEFF WILLIAMS: When we were
making steel for tools,

10:05.350 --> 10:08.520
part of the process
is to use a blast furnace

10:08.520 --> 10:12.020
to remove carbon
out of it completely,

10:12.020 --> 10:15.780
but we always have about point
two to two percent left over.

10:15.780 --> 10:17.860
There's always a carbon
signature on our steel,

10:17.860 --> 10:19.450
but there wasn't
any carbon whatsoever

10:19.450 --> 10:21.660
that was found in this
particular material.

10:21.660 --> 10:27.160
TSOUKALOS: This object may be
as old as 140 million years.

10:27.160 --> 10:31.420
And obviously,
that's a crazy proposition

10:31.420 --> 10:34.210
if you think that modern‐day
archeology suggests

10:34.210 --> 10:37.420
that we've only been around
for about 10,000 years,

10:37.420 --> 10:40.140
you know, creating stuff
with our own hands.

10:40.140 --> 10:42.640
So, this falls into the category

10:42.640 --> 10:45.850
of out of place artifacts.

10:45.850 --> 10:49.440
Artifacts that shouldn't exist.

10:49.440 --> 10:53.190
NARRATOR: If the London Hammer
really dates back

10:53.190 --> 10:57.650
to over 100 million years,
as the data suggests,

10:57.650 --> 11:00.490
this find would have to
fundamentally reshape

11:00.490 --> 11:03.700
our understanding of human
development on Planet Earth.

11:05.990 --> 11:08.410
But ancient astronaut
theorists suggest

11:08.410 --> 11:11.580
there is another,
much more substantial relic

11:11.580 --> 11:15.090
of the ancient world
that is far older

11:15.090 --> 11:17.630
than mainstream
archaeologists propose:

11:17.630 --> 11:21.180
the Great Pyramid of Giza.

11:26.510 --> 11:28.560
NARRATOR:
Giza, Egypt.

11:28.560 --> 11:32.440
Here, on the west bank
of the Nile,

11:32.440 --> 11:36.360
stands the oldest of the Seven
Wonders of the Ancient World:

11:36.360 --> 11:38.820
the Great Pyramid.

11:38.820 --> 11:42.700
According to accepted history,

11:42.700 --> 11:46.370
the Great Pyramid was built
around 2500 BC

11:46.370 --> 11:48.540
as a tomb
for the Pharaoh Khufu.

11:51.290 --> 11:53.960
However, the dating
of the pyramid

11:53.960 --> 11:56.380
and its association with Khufu

11:56.380 --> 12:01.170
is based entirely on evidence
discovered in May of 1837

12:01.170 --> 12:04.050
by British explorer
Richard Howard Vyse.

12:07.220 --> 12:10.600
Colonel Vyse, um,
basically used, um, gunpowder...

12:43.680 --> 12:46.390
NARRATOR: Since stone
cannot be carbon‐dated,

12:46.390 --> 12:48.430
and no other inscriptions,

12:48.430 --> 12:50.680
except for the Pharaoh's
official monogram,

12:50.680 --> 12:52.730
were found on the pyramid,

12:52.730 --> 12:55.980
this date has stood
relatively unchallenged.

12:55.980 --> 13:00.070
However, new evidence
that has been found

13:00.070 --> 13:02.570
in Colonel Vyse's
personal journal

13:02.570 --> 13:06.280
has researchers questioning
his discovery.

13:06.280 --> 13:08.320
Some have even suggested

13:08.320 --> 13:11.700
that he may have forged
the name of Khufu himself.

13:39.440 --> 13:40.860
NARRATOR: After the
contradicting evidence

13:40.860 --> 13:42.730
was exposed,

13:42.730 --> 13:48.320
in 2014, two University of
Dresden archaeology students

13:48.320 --> 13:52.330
smuggled a sample of the paint
used in the King Khufu markings

13:52.330 --> 13:54.700
and had it analyzed
by a German laboratory.

13:54.700 --> 13:58.750
The sample was too small
for radiocarbon dating,

13:58.750 --> 14:03.050
but the technicians were able
to determine something shocking:

14:03.050 --> 14:08.180
the pigment was not painted onto
the original limestone blocks,

14:08.180 --> 14:12.010
but a later plaster repair.

14:12.010 --> 14:16.310
This finding suggests that
the cartouche was not original

14:16.310 --> 14:20.350
to the pyramid construction,
but added at a much later date.

14:22.980 --> 14:28.240
Colonel Vyse had spent nearly
$1.3 million on his expedition

14:28.240 --> 14:32.160
to uncover truths
about the Great Pyramid.

14:32.160 --> 14:36.080
Is it possible that in his
desperation to find something,

14:36.080 --> 14:40.250
he did the unthinkable and
forged the cartouche of Khufu

14:40.250 --> 14:45.050
onto the chamber wall, thereby
establishing an inaccurate date

14:45.050 --> 14:46.380
for the structure?

14:48.130 --> 14:51.680
Interestingly,
this is not the only evidence

14:51.680 --> 14:53.850
contradicting the dating
of the Pyramid

14:53.850 --> 14:57.060
and the entire Giza Complex.

14:57.060 --> 15:02.150
A seventh century BC text
known as the Inventory Stela,

15:02.150 --> 15:05.820
unearthed by archaeologists
in 1858,

15:05.820 --> 15:08.240
details repairs
made by Pharaoh Khufu,

15:08.240 --> 15:10.490
including work on the Sphinx.

15:31.930 --> 15:35.050
NARRATOR: Could the dating of
the entire Giza site be wrong?

15:37.350 --> 15:42.900
In 1992, Boston University
geologist Robert Schoch

15:42.900 --> 15:45.820
created a stir
among Egyptologists

15:45.820 --> 15:49.530
when he suggested that, based
on the evidence of water erosion

15:49.530 --> 15:51.320
at the Sphinx enclosure,

15:51.320 --> 15:57.160
he would date the site
to approximately 10,500 BC.

15:57.160 --> 15:59.950
SCHOCH: Immediately,
without even seeing my evidence,

15:59.950 --> 16:02.710
they start going,
"It doesn't go back that far."

16:02.710 --> 16:05.750
I was talking about
real evidence, real science,

16:05.750 --> 16:08.380
which they simply did not
want to hear,

16:08.380 --> 16:12.430
because it did not fit
their preconceptions.

16:12.430 --> 16:14.260
NARRATOR:
Like the Sphinx,

16:14.260 --> 16:18.390
is it possible that the Great
Pyramid is also far older

16:18.390 --> 16:21.560
than Egyptologists
are willing to admit?

16:21.560 --> 16:25.060
But if so, just who built it?

16:25.060 --> 16:28.730
According to Arabian writers

16:28.730 --> 16:31.190
Ibrahim al‐Maqrizi,

16:31.190 --> 16:34.780
the Great Pyramid
was not constructed by Khufu,

16:34.780 --> 16:37.410
the Great Pyramid
was constructed

16:37.410 --> 16:39.120
long before the Great Flood

16:39.120 --> 16:41.870
by a king
with the name of Surid.

16:44.290 --> 16:47.710
And then, the old
Arabian writers clearly say

16:47.710 --> 16:53.470
Surid is the same figure which
the Hebrew society calls Enoch.

16:53.470 --> 16:56.930
WILLIAM HENRY: Enoch was taken
up into the heavens

16:56.930 --> 16:59.140
by the archangel Michael.

16:59.140 --> 17:03.520
He was told by the angels
of a coming cataclysm

17:03.520 --> 17:06.900
and he was instructed
to build the Great Pyramid

17:06.900 --> 17:09.110
as a repository
for the knowledge

17:09.110 --> 17:11.030
that he not only
learned in Heaven,

17:11.030 --> 17:13.820
but all the earthly knowledge
as well.

17:13.820 --> 17:18.450
Perhaps these were otherworldly
beings described as angels.

17:21.410 --> 17:25.080
Maybe everything we know
about Egyptology is wrong.

17:25.080 --> 17:28.040
And we have to go back and,
and open up our imagination

17:28.040 --> 17:31.750
to the possibility
that there's another explanation

17:31.750 --> 17:34.260
that in fact involves the
assistance of extraterrestrials

17:34.260 --> 17:36.720
in the creation of
the Great Pyramid.

17:39.390 --> 17:42.470
NARRATOR:
In November 2015,

17:42.470 --> 17:45.520
researchers at Giza
scanned the Great Pyramid

17:45.520 --> 17:47.020
using thermal cameras,

17:47.020 --> 17:50.360
and found two anomalous areas.

17:50.360 --> 17:54.110
They submitted a request
to the Department of Antiquities

17:54.110 --> 17:56.450
to do a more
formal investigation

17:56.450 --> 17:58.910
in hopes of locating
what they believe

17:58.910 --> 18:01.530
might be hidden chambers.

18:01.530 --> 18:06.410
As scientists continue to
discover new finds at the site,

18:06.410 --> 18:08.420
might they stumble upon
the evidence

18:08.420 --> 18:11.130
that supports
the ancient accounts?

18:11.130 --> 18:13.750
After all,

18:13.750 --> 18:16.170
this has happened before,

18:16.170 --> 18:18.590
with the unearthing
of a once mythical land.

18:28.770 --> 18:32.320
NARRATOR:
Hisarlik, Turkey. 1870.

18:32.320 --> 18:35.190
This small village is the site

18:35.190 --> 18:39.070
of one of the most sensational
discoveries of the 19th century:

18:39.070 --> 18:43.450
the legendary city of Troy.

18:43.450 --> 18:47.080
The city was the infamous
location for the Trojan War

18:47.080 --> 18:50.080
described in the classic
Greek epic <i>The Iliad.</i>

18:53.460 --> 18:55.000
Prior to its discovery

18:55.000 --> 18:57.970
by amateur archaeologist
Heinrich Schliemann,

18:57.970 --> 19:03.430
Troy was considered
to be a mythical location.

19:03.430 --> 19:08.770
Heinrich Schliemann, a German
businessman and pioneer,

19:08.770 --> 19:12.270
read Homer's <i>Odyssey</i>
and <i>The Iliad</i>

19:12.270 --> 19:16.190
and he became convinced
that Troy existed

19:16.190 --> 19:20.910
somewhere in Turkey, where
it's placed within the story.

19:20.910 --> 19:24.450
So he went out to Turkey

19:24.450 --> 19:27.790
and he asked
the locals out there

19:27.790 --> 19:29.790
what they knew about
the legends.

19:29.790 --> 19:32.710
And they eventually pointed him
in the direction

19:32.710 --> 19:35.670
of a huge mound.

19:35.670 --> 19:37.960
So here he dug,

19:37.960 --> 19:43.090
and he found
the lost city of Troy itself.

19:43.090 --> 19:45.430
NARRATOR:
In addition to Troy,

19:45.430 --> 19:47.850
other cities that were
previously relegated

19:47.850 --> 19:49.980
to the realm of mythology

19:49.980 --> 19:52.900
have also been discovered
to be real.

19:54.270 --> 19:56.770
The Mediterranean Sea.

19:56.770 --> 19:58.480
2000.

19:58.480 --> 20:00.440
A group of divers working off

20:00.440 --> 20:03.110
the Egyptian coast
near Alexandria

20:03.110 --> 20:05.950
discovered the submerged ruins
of statues

20:05.950 --> 20:08.620
and even entire
temple complexes.

20:08.620 --> 20:10.830
One instance of the
discovery of something

20:10.830 --> 20:12.500
that we thought was legendary

20:12.500 --> 20:15.210
was the discovery of
Heracleion, Thonis,

20:15.210 --> 20:17.460
near Alexandria.

20:17.460 --> 20:20.420
We had read about this in
Greek myth and Greek histories.

20:20.420 --> 20:22.090
We had no evidence for it.

20:22.090 --> 20:24.970
And then, one day,
it gets discovered.

20:24.970 --> 20:29.680
NARRATOR: Dating back
to the seventh century BC,

20:29.680 --> 20:33.730
Thonis, or Heracleion,
as it was known to the Greeks,

20:33.730 --> 20:35.980
was cited in ancient myths

20:35.980 --> 20:38.520
as a major trading post
for the region.

20:38.520 --> 20:40.320
JONATHAN YOUNG:
For a long time.

20:40.320 --> 20:43.570
Heracleion in Egypt
was in many stories,

20:43.570 --> 20:46.490
but had not been found
until the year 2000.

20:46.490 --> 20:50.330
In India, in the year 2001,

20:50.330 --> 20:51.950
something similar happened.

20:51.950 --> 20:56.130
The Mahabharata
tells of the time

20:56.130 --> 21:00.630
Lord Vishnu built a great
fortified city, Dvaraka.

21:00.630 --> 21:03.130
It was thought to be
an imaginary place

21:03.130 --> 21:05.260
and then, it was discovered.

21:05.260 --> 21:09.600
And before that, in the first
half of the 20th century,

21:09.600 --> 21:11.560
there is another example.

21:11.560 --> 21:14.690
In the Bible, Joshua fought
the Battle of Jericho,

21:14.690 --> 21:16.560
but we didn't know
if there was a Jericho

21:16.560 --> 21:19.110
until it was discovered
by archeologists.

21:19.110 --> 21:22.400
This lets us know that there is
more information in myth

21:22.400 --> 21:24.530
than we might have thought.

21:26.530 --> 21:29.370
NARRATOR:
But of all the places on Earth

21:29.370 --> 21:31.620
that were thought to be
mythological,

21:31.620 --> 21:34.540
the one that has inspired
the most fascination,

21:34.540 --> 21:37.250
and has proven the most elusive,

21:37.250 --> 21:40.540
is not a city,
but an entire continent:

21:40.540 --> 21:42.300
Atlantis.

21:42.300 --> 21:46.760
As described by Plato
in the fourth century AD,

21:46.760 --> 21:50.930
Atlantis was the home of
a highly advanced civilization

21:50.930 --> 21:53.310
which mysteriously disappeared
into the ocean

21:53.310 --> 21:56.230
thousands of years ago.

21:56.230 --> 21:59.770
While mainstream scholars
continue to dismiss Atlantis

21:59.770 --> 22:02.690
as nothing more than
a fanciful myth,

22:02.690 --> 22:05.320
there are many who believe
Plato's account

22:05.320 --> 22:08.860
was based on a very real place.

22:08.860 --> 22:13.410
But if Atlantis, like other
formerly mythical locations,

22:13.410 --> 22:16.000
were discovered,
would it offer proof

22:16.000 --> 22:19.330
of extraterrestrial contact
with early humans?

22:25.760 --> 22:30.300
Dunedin, New Zealand.
February 2017.

22:30.300 --> 22:35.020
Scientists at New Zealand's
top geological institute,

22:35.020 --> 22:36.770
GNS Science,

22:36.770 --> 22:40.100
announce the discovery
of a lost continent,

22:40.100 --> 22:44.110
one that sunk into the ocean
millions of years ago.

22:44.110 --> 22:47.440
They dub the landmass
"Zealandia,"

22:47.440 --> 22:50.450
as it extends directly
under New Zealand.

22:50.450 --> 22:54.410
Although it is almost
entirely underwater,

22:54.410 --> 22:57.040
it fits the definition
of a continent

22:57.040 --> 22:59.790
as it consists of
an intact piece of crust

22:59.790 --> 23:03.210
that is distinctly different
from the ocean floor,

23:03.210 --> 23:07.170
and clearly separated
from Australia.

23:07.170 --> 23:11.390
This was a shocking discovery,

23:11.390 --> 23:13.510
because they thought the number
of continents on Earth

23:13.510 --> 23:15.260
had been basically fixed.

23:15.260 --> 23:17.020
Now, this one looks like
it could have been

23:17.020 --> 23:18.730
another continent,

23:18.730 --> 23:21.520
where perhaps
human beings dwelled.

23:21.520 --> 23:23.230
And if it was,

23:23.230 --> 23:25.610
this could certainly rewrite
a lot of history books.

23:28.030 --> 23:32.320
NARRATOR: Could this be
the lost continent of Atlantis?

23:32.320 --> 23:34.200
Ancient astronaut theorists

23:34.200 --> 23:37.290
say that it is
a distinct possibility.

23:37.290 --> 23:40.500
There is an ongoing bias
among scientists

23:40.500 --> 23:43.040
that anything from the
ancient past must, therefore,

23:43.040 --> 23:47.090
be a made‐up fake story, a myth.

23:47.090 --> 23:50.970
And yet, these scientists
have to look at the reality

23:50.970 --> 23:54.350
that archaeological discoveries
are verifying

23:54.350 --> 23:57.060
that the actual stories
have merit.

24:05.060 --> 24:06.940
NARRATOR:
New York City.

24:06.940 --> 24:09.570
February 2017.

24:09.570 --> 24:12.450
That's pretty amazing
we were able to do this.

24:12.450 --> 24:15.780
NARRATOR: Giorgio Tsoukalos
and Jared Collins

24:15.780 --> 24:17.950
continue their scientific
investigation

24:17.950 --> 24:21.750
of a mysterious 2000‐year‐old
elongated skull.

24:21.750 --> 24:24.170
We were able to set up
a CT scan.

24:24.170 --> 24:26.460
I mean,
that's almost unheard of.

24:28.670 --> 24:29.800
Wow.

24:29.800 --> 24:31.380
NARRATOR:
Because anthropologist

24:31.380 --> 24:33.130
Dr. Todd Disotell

24:33.130 --> 24:36.100
found this skull to be missing
the sagittal suture

24:36.100 --> 24:39.850
that exists on all
naturally formed human skulls,

24:39.850 --> 24:43.020
Giorgio and Jared have taken it

24:43.020 --> 24:46.860
to New York University's
radiology department.

24:46.860 --> 24:49.820
There, it will be subjected
to a CT scan...

24:49.820 --> 24:51.530
‐Let's scan it.
‐Yeah, let's see what's inside.

24:51.530 --> 24:53.820
NARRATOR: ...which should reveal
whether or not

24:53.820 --> 24:55.860
the skull really is
missing the suture,

24:55.860 --> 25:00.410
or if it is simply
not visible to the naked eye.

25:00.410 --> 25:04.960
During the procedure, a series
of computerized x‐ray images

25:04.960 --> 25:09.000
are taken from 360 degrees
and stacked together

25:09.000 --> 25:11.130
to form a 3‐D image.

25:11.130 --> 25:13.880
If any hairline evidence
of the missing suture exists,

25:13.880 --> 25:16.800
it will show up in the scan.

25:16.800 --> 25:19.140
TSOUKALOS:
That looks amazing.

25:19.140 --> 25:21.100
‐It is incredible.
‐Isn't it incredible? ‐Yeah.

25:21.100 --> 25:22.890
So these are
surface rendered images

25:22.890 --> 25:24.850
to allow you to see the skull.

25:24.850 --> 25:28.900
For the sake of comparison,
we have put similar images

25:28.900 --> 25:30.650
of a actual patient.

25:30.650 --> 25:32.070
‐TSOUKALOS: Okay. ‐McGUINNESS:
So you can obviously see

25:32.070 --> 25:33.900
the teeth, the orbits

25:33.900 --> 25:35.990
where the eyes would sit
and you can see

25:35.990 --> 25:37.700
that it's a very deformed skull.

25:37.700 --> 25:39.660
Do you find any
strange anomalies‐‐

25:39.660 --> 25:41.580
besides the shape, obviously?

25:41.580 --> 25:44.500
Well, there's a lot
that's interesting about this.

25:44.500 --> 25:47.540
There's a sagittal suture that
runs across the top of the skull

25:47.540 --> 25:49.670
that I'm not seeing
on this skull.

25:49.670 --> 25:54.670
It's fused, but what is
confounding to me is

25:54.670 --> 25:56.720
you can see the sutures
in the other areas.

25:56.720 --> 25:59.390
TSOUKALOS:
And the fusing of a suture,

25:59.390 --> 26:03.600
is that something where,
if we were to look closer,

26:03.600 --> 26:06.770
would we see a remnant
of that suture?

26:06.770 --> 26:09.770
We can look at it this way
on these images.

26:09.770 --> 26:12.110
So you can see right here,
there should be

26:12.110 --> 26:14.440
a sagittal suture right there
and we're not seeing it.

26:14.440 --> 26:16.740
There's a lot of distortion,
but I'll show you.

26:16.740 --> 26:18.950
This is what a suture elsewhere
would look like,

26:18.950 --> 26:21.490
so these are the sutures,
uh, elsewhere.

26:21.490 --> 26:26.160
Have you seen many skulls
that have missing sutures?

26:26.160 --> 26:28.330
I've never seen anything
like this skull.

26:31.170 --> 26:33.920
NARRATOR:
Ancient astronaut theorists

26:33.920 --> 26:38.010
point out that science often
has a difficult time with data‐‐

26:38.010 --> 26:40.840
such as the missing
sagittal sutures‐‐

26:40.840 --> 26:43.890
that does not fit
into the accepted paradigm.

26:43.890 --> 26:45.850
And they suggest

26:45.850 --> 26:49.100
that findings that defy
conventional explanation

26:49.100 --> 26:53.770
often get set aside,
instead of being investigated.

26:56.740 --> 26:58.740
St. Catharines.

26:58.740 --> 26:59.660
Ontario, Canada.

26:59.660 --> 27:02.870
Spring 1970.

27:02.870 --> 27:06.330
Researchers at
the Earth Sciences Department

27:06.330 --> 27:07.910
at Brock University

27:07.910 --> 27:12.040
receive a sample of wood
that was found buried

27:12.040 --> 27:16.760
150 feet underground
on an island off Nova Scotia.

27:16.760 --> 27:19.760
After scientists run
carbon dating tests

27:19.760 --> 27:22.010
on the material,

27:22.010 --> 27:26.850
they place the object as being
from 3000 years in the future.

27:26.850 --> 27:30.890
Confounded, the team
runs the test again,

27:30.890 --> 27:33.810
only to get
the exact same results.

27:33.810 --> 27:37.030
TSOUKALOS: Since it's an organic
piece of material,

27:37.030 --> 27:39.360
they were able to date it.

27:39.360 --> 27:42.490
But the dates that they received

27:42.490 --> 27:46.080
completely contradicted
everything, because

27:46.080 --> 27:49.540
it had a date of 3,000 years
into the future.

27:49.540 --> 27:51.160
Well, how is that possible?

27:53.460 --> 27:57.550
NARRATOR: How is it that
modern dating techniques

27:57.550 --> 28:02.010
can produce results that are
so obviously contradictory?

28:02.010 --> 28:05.510
The basic idea behind
radiocarbon dating is that

28:05.510 --> 28:08.350
radioactive carbon
decays at a set rate,

28:08.350 --> 28:11.690
and you can use that
to date when various animals

28:11.690 --> 28:15.230
and life‐forms died
and how long they've been dead.

28:15.230 --> 28:18.730
NARRATOR: However, there are
known flaws in the science.

28:18.730 --> 28:20.320
Inorganic materials,

28:20.320 --> 28:23.820
like stone,
cannot be carbon‐dated.

28:23.820 --> 28:26.330
And exposure to radioactivity

28:26.330 --> 28:29.410
can alter the dates
dramatically.

28:29.410 --> 28:33.000
JOHN BRANDENBURG:
The dating may abruptly increase

28:33.000 --> 28:35.330
because of nuclear weapons
going off.

28:35.330 --> 28:38.840
It's also changed
if a volcano erupts,

28:38.840 --> 28:40.880
it puts a lot of carbon dioxide
in the air.

28:40.880 --> 28:44.890
But scientists crave certainty,
like all human beings,

28:44.890 --> 28:46.350
certainty and predictability.

28:46.350 --> 28:48.560
So they tend to minimize
the caveats.

28:52.640 --> 28:55.770
NARRATOR: But if the carbon
measurements can be skewed

28:55.770 --> 28:57.980
due to exposure to radiation,

28:57.980 --> 29:01.610
just how inaccurate
might the dating be?

29:01.610 --> 29:04.110
Perhaps answers can be found

29:04.110 --> 29:06.820
when the process
is put to yet another,

29:06.820 --> 29:09.450
even more confounding test.

29:13.400 --> 29:15.480
NARRATOR:
Irvine, California.

29:15.480 --> 29:18.070
April 2017.

29:18.070 --> 29:21.320
Ancient astronaut theorist
Giorgio Tsoukalos

29:21.320 --> 29:22.700
is visiting

29:22.700 --> 29:24.870
the Keck Carbon Cycle
Research Lab

29:24.870 --> 29:26.700
at the University of California

29:26.700 --> 29:29.250
to see firsthand how radiation

29:29.250 --> 29:32.830
can dramatically alter
the results of carbon dating.

29:32.830 --> 29:35.250
‐Dr. Southon.
‐Oh, hi.

29:35.250 --> 29:36.670
Giorgio. Pleasure to meet you.

29:36.670 --> 29:38.210
‐How you doing?
‐Pleasure to meet you.

29:38.210 --> 29:40.210
I'm here to learn about
carbon dating.

29:40.210 --> 29:41.550
Let me show you
how this thing works.

29:41.550 --> 29:42.800
‐All right.
‐Follow me.

29:42.800 --> 29:46.390
NARRATOR:
Dr. John Southon

29:46.390 --> 29:49.770
is using accelerator mass
spectrometry equipment

29:49.770 --> 29:51.810
to carbon date
a sample of redwood

29:51.810 --> 29:53.810
that was exposed to radiation

29:53.810 --> 29:58.190
during the testing
of atomic weapons in the 1950s.

29:58.190 --> 30:02.070
The process begins by
sterilizing the wood chip

30:02.070 --> 30:04.110
and then exposing it

30:04.110 --> 30:08.450
to various chemical processes
to remove any contamination.

30:08.450 --> 30:12.080
The material undergoes
a combustion process

30:12.080 --> 30:16.540
and is reduced to graphite
for optimal data retrieval.

30:16.540 --> 30:20.090
Finally, the graphite
is sent through

30:20.090 --> 30:22.260
an accelerated mass spectrometer
to measure

30:22.260 --> 30:24.090
the rate of radiocarbon decay

30:24.090 --> 30:27.600
and generate
the age of the object.

30:27.600 --> 30:29.180
SOUTHON:
Pull up a chair.

30:29.180 --> 30:30.760
All right.

30:33.560 --> 30:35.140
So what are we looking at here?

30:35.140 --> 30:38.270
Okay, so, this is
our result here.

30:38.270 --> 30:40.860
This is how much radiocarbon

30:40.860 --> 30:43.530
was in the samples

30:43.530 --> 30:44.900
that we measured
from that redwood.

30:44.900 --> 30:46.240
Okay.

30:46.240 --> 30:48.820
And the thing
that's strange about them

30:48.820 --> 30:52.290
is that the radiocarbon age
is negative,

30:52.290 --> 30:55.620
which means,
at least at face value,

30:55.620 --> 30:58.170
these are from 600 years
in the future.

30:58.170 --> 31:00.590
Really? Okay.

31:00.590 --> 31:04.630
And the explanation for that
has to do with

31:04.630 --> 31:07.720
nuclear weapons testing
in the atmosphere

31:07.720 --> 31:10.800
in the 1950s and 1960s.

31:10.800 --> 31:12.560
This is amazing.

31:12.560 --> 31:14.980
In your estimation,
do you think that

31:14.980 --> 31:19.900
if an object is closer, let's
say, to a nuclear testing site,

31:19.900 --> 31:24.900
that an item like that would be
yielding more crazy results?

31:24.900 --> 31:27.150
If it was really close, yes.

31:27.150 --> 31:28.610
Okay.

31:28.610 --> 31:30.410
So it would
give you dates that

31:30.410 --> 31:31.990
would be the equivalent of

31:31.990 --> 31:35.250
tens of thousands of years
in the future.

31:35.250 --> 31:38.500
Well, I think that's so
incredibly fascinating.

31:38.500 --> 31:41.920
TSOUKALOS:
If any object is exposed

31:41.920 --> 31:44.260
to some type of
a thermonuclear event,

31:44.260 --> 31:47.470
it changes the result
of the carbon dating.

31:49.050 --> 31:50.760
So I think that it's about time

31:50.760 --> 31:53.310
for us to look
at our ancient history,

31:53.310 --> 31:55.720
because what if
something similar

31:55.720 --> 31:57.390
happened in our past?

31:57.390 --> 32:00.350
NARRATOR:
Stories of ancient warfare

32:00.350 --> 32:03.400
involving the gods using
sophisticated weapons

32:03.400 --> 32:06.360
can be found in numerous texts.

32:06.360 --> 32:09.280
And ancient astronaut theorists

32:09.280 --> 32:12.870
have long proposed that these
stories are backed up

32:12.870 --> 32:17.830
by physical evidence that can be
found throughout the world.

32:17.830 --> 32:20.920
One curious site
that seems to indicate

32:20.920 --> 32:23.250
some kind of an atomic explosion

32:23.250 --> 32:27.670
is the very
southwestern corner of Egypt,

32:27.670 --> 32:30.340
right up along the border
of Libya.

32:30.340 --> 32:33.050
And that area is a sandy area,

32:33.050 --> 32:37.680
but it is covered with evidence
of vitrification.

32:37.680 --> 32:41.020
That's what happens when you
detonate an atomic bomb

32:41.020 --> 32:42.770
in a desert area,

32:42.770 --> 32:44.650
it turns the desert into glass.

32:44.650 --> 32:47.400
And also at Mohenjo‐Daro,

32:47.400 --> 32:49.650
which is on the border
of Pakistan and India,

32:49.650 --> 32:52.950
were these lumps of glass

32:52.950 --> 32:56.080
that had been molten and melted.

32:56.080 --> 32:58.580
And there were skeletons
that were also found

32:58.580 --> 33:01.420
that were radioactive.

33:01.420 --> 33:05.380
So the evidence shows that
there was some kind of

33:05.380 --> 33:09.630
atomic detonation or atomic war
in our ancient history.

33:11.720 --> 33:14.350
BRANDENBURG:
There are suggestions that

33:14.350 --> 33:18.520
there may have been some past
nuclear weapon's detonation.

33:18.520 --> 33:21.520
And if that occurred,

33:21.520 --> 33:27.020
then the carbon dating must
account for that possibility.

33:27.020 --> 33:29.990
And that would make, by the way,
everything look younger

33:29.990 --> 33:31.990
in carbon dating.

33:33.990 --> 33:36.030
NARRATOR: The oldest dates
that can be measured

33:36.030 --> 33:41.410
by carbon dating go back
to only 70,000 years ago,

33:41.410 --> 33:43.540
a tiny fraction
of Earth's estimated

33:43.540 --> 33:46.420
six‐billion‐year history.

33:46.420 --> 33:50.210
Scientists have come to rely
on the fossil record

33:50.210 --> 33:54.430
to fill in the gaps, but that,
too, has its limitations.

34:01.180 --> 34:04.140
Myanmar, Southeast Asia.

34:04.140 --> 34:07.690
December 8, 2016.

34:07.690 --> 34:11.610
Paleontologists discover
a piece of amber

34:11.610 --> 34:14.740
containing the perfectly
preserved tail of a dinosaur

34:14.740 --> 34:17.620
believed by mainstream
scientists to be

34:17.620 --> 34:20.540
99 million years old.

34:22.040 --> 34:23.500
(roaring)

34:23.500 --> 34:26.920
The specimen is shocking
as it reveals

34:26.920 --> 34:29.420
that not all dinosaurs were
covered in scales,

34:29.420 --> 34:32.130
as they had been depicted
for more than a century.

34:32.130 --> 34:35.260
Some actually had feathers.

34:37.180 --> 34:41.100
But how could archaeologists
have gotten it so wrong?

34:41.100 --> 34:42.930
CARGILL:
One of the criticisms

34:42.930 --> 34:46.190
against the fossil record
are the gaps in the record.

34:46.190 --> 34:49.400
That is, we can see what we
think this animal looked like,

34:49.400 --> 34:51.820
you know, three million
years ago,

34:51.820 --> 34:53.320
and then we can see
what we think it looked like

34:53.320 --> 34:54.700
one million years ago,

34:54.700 --> 34:56.240
but what happened in between?

34:58.620 --> 35:02.160
NARRATOR: Due to gaps
of up to 80 million years,

35:02.160 --> 35:05.710
the fossil record is
woefully incomplete,

35:05.710 --> 35:07.750
and the process of
becoming a fossil

35:07.750 --> 35:11.090
itself is extremely difficult.

35:11.090 --> 35:14.050
PETER WARD: Vertebrate bones are
very difficult

35:14.050 --> 35:15.970
to turn into fossils.

35:15.970 --> 35:18.890
We are these wonderful
picnic lunches

35:18.890 --> 35:21.600
for a lot of different
creatures.

35:21.600 --> 35:25.980
Unless you fall into
a water‐filled mud bath,

35:25.980 --> 35:30.650
or in the ocean, leaving your
bones almost anywhere

35:30.650 --> 35:35.280
is going to make sure it's never
turned into a fossil.

35:35.280 --> 35:37.780
There's life‐forms that have
never, probably,

35:37.780 --> 35:39.530
ever been fossilized.

35:39.530 --> 35:42.240
This leaves room for all kinds

35:42.240 --> 35:44.950
of anomalous beings
to really exist.

35:44.950 --> 35:47.660
We may yet find fossils

35:47.660 --> 35:50.210
of nine‐foot giants,

35:50.210 --> 35:53.250
and even of extraterrestrials.

35:53.250 --> 35:56.340
NARRATOR: While conventional
science remains resistant

35:56.340 --> 35:59.260
to the notion that
extraterrestrial

35:59.260 --> 36:02.220
or hybrid beings have ever
existed on the planet,

36:02.220 --> 36:05.140
ancient astronaut
theorists believe

36:05.140 --> 36:08.770
they may be very close to
uncovering definitive proof.

36:14.440 --> 36:17.150
NARRATOR:
Los Angeles, California.

36:17.150 --> 36:20.490
April 2017.

36:20.490 --> 36:24.950
After nearly two months,
the results from the DNA test

36:24.950 --> 36:28.460
that was performed on a 2,000‐
year‐old elongated skull

36:28.460 --> 36:32.420
from Paracas, Peru,
are finally in.

36:32.420 --> 36:35.960
To analyze the results,
Giorgio enlisted the help

36:35.960 --> 36:38.590
of Dr. Todd Disotell.

36:38.590 --> 36:41.510
All right, Todd,
you got the results?

36:48.880 --> 36:51.080
NARRATOR:
Los Angeles, California.

36:51.080 --> 36:54.000
April 2017.

36:54.000 --> 36:57.170
All right, Todd,
you got the results?

36:57.170 --> 36:59.800
Yeah, and they're very,
very interesting.

36:59.800 --> 37:02.260
NARRATOR:
Giorgio Tsoukalos is online

37:02.260 --> 37:05.130
with anthropologist
Dr. Todd Disotell

37:05.130 --> 37:07.600
to receive the results
of a DNA test

37:07.600 --> 37:11.020
that was performed
on an elongated skull.

37:11.020 --> 37:15.650
They did get a good,
clean DNA profile

37:15.650 --> 37:18.690
from the maternally
inherited DNA.

37:18.690 --> 37:22.650
So this particular specimen
is actually not found

37:22.650 --> 37:24.150
in the New World,

37:24.150 --> 37:26.490
not found amongst
Native Americans,

37:26.490 --> 37:31.120
and it's typically found amongst
Europeans and Middle Easterners.

37:31.120 --> 37:35.040
In fact, the 100% match was
to a Scottish individual.

37:35.040 --> 37:38.330
This makes no sense whatsoever.

37:38.330 --> 37:41.250
Really?
In a South American skull?

37:41.250 --> 37:42.880
This is all very strange.

37:42.880 --> 37:45.630
That could mean that
people from Europe

37:45.630 --> 37:48.680
got to South America,

37:48.680 --> 37:52.180
you know, 1,500 years earlier

37:52.180 --> 37:55.390
than we currently
understand that.

37:55.390 --> 37:57.230
That's amazing.

37:57.230 --> 38:00.650
Unfortunately,
the condition of the sample

38:00.650 --> 38:03.610
did not yield any
"Y" chromosome.

38:03.610 --> 38:06.360
But that's not surprising.

38:06.360 --> 38:09.820
There is between
a couple hundred

38:09.820 --> 38:14.750
to a couple thousand times
as much maternal DNA

38:14.750 --> 38:16.410
in every cell of the body.

38:16.410 --> 38:19.000
So what does that mean?

38:19.000 --> 38:21.540
What have we not found out
because of that?

38:21.540 --> 38:24.460
Well, so one, that would allow
us to definitively determine

38:24.460 --> 38:29.220
the sex, and knowing
who the father was

38:29.220 --> 38:32.100
would be very, very informative.

38:32.100 --> 38:34.310
Unfortunately,
we're missing that.

38:34.310 --> 38:35.890
Right.

38:35.890 --> 38:40.190
Do you think that a case
can be made at all‐‐

38:40.190 --> 38:43.150
and again, this is
complete speculation‐‐

38:43.150 --> 38:46.780
that perhaps it is not
necessarily human.

38:46.780 --> 38:49.240
Is that a possibility?

38:49.240 --> 38:50.780
Well, it's possible.

38:50.780 --> 38:52.740
But still, we actually
don't know what this is.

38:52.740 --> 38:55.830
Since we didn't get
any definitive result,

38:55.830 --> 39:00.330
obviously, a scientist always
wants to try to do that.

39:00.330 --> 39:02.250
This is extraordinary.

39:02.250 --> 39:05.460
Yeah. It still leaves open
the possibility

39:05.460 --> 39:07.170
of something interesting.

39:07.170 --> 39:11.050
Right, so I think that
we have something here

39:11.050 --> 39:14.510
that definitely merits
further investigation.

39:14.510 --> 39:17.850
It's worthy of study,
or opening up

39:17.850 --> 39:21.150
a new area of inquiry
and some new hypotheses.

39:24.230 --> 39:26.690
The results confirmed the fact

39:26.690 --> 39:29.110
that there is a mystery there.

39:29.110 --> 39:32.910
First of all, we couldn't figure
out who the father is

39:32.910 --> 39:34.620
of that thing.

39:34.620 --> 39:37.790
Number two, it has European DNA.

39:37.790 --> 39:40.460
Two things that make no sense.

39:40.460 --> 39:43.380
And it had a missing
sagittal suture.

39:43.380 --> 39:45.670
So I do think that

39:45.670 --> 39:47.550
that is
an extraterrestrial skull.

39:49.130 --> 39:51.470
NARRATOR:
Could preconceived notions

39:51.470 --> 39:55.050
concerning mankind's origins
be causing scientists

39:55.050 --> 39:57.770
to overlook valuable data?

39:57.770 --> 40:01.060
Ancient astronaut theorists
say yes,

40:01.060 --> 40:04.400
and suggest that
the scientific community

40:04.400 --> 40:07.650
has been too quick to find
answers when they should be

40:07.650 --> 40:10.190
asking more questions.

40:12.990 --> 40:15.990
Science has built this house‐‐
it's called the standard model‐‐

40:15.990 --> 40:18.870
and, unfortunately, this house
has some big holes

40:18.870 --> 40:22.580
in its walls, and we hang
paintings over them, basically,

40:22.580 --> 40:26.590
and we try to kind of
paper those over.

40:26.590 --> 40:30.920
We want certainty,
we want everything to fit,

40:30.920 --> 40:34.090
but new knowledge
always changes things.

40:34.090 --> 40:37.220
WILLIAMS: The model of thinking
in modern‐day academia

40:37.220 --> 40:40.430
is that artifacts
can't possibly exist

40:40.430 --> 40:43.350
outside of our
chronological timeline.

40:43.350 --> 40:45.730
They decide it's easier
to simply

40:45.730 --> 40:47.610
put the pieces in that fit,

40:47.610 --> 40:49.900
and remove the pieces
that don't.

40:49.900 --> 40:53.990
CHILDRESS:
Scientists are far too quick

40:53.990 --> 40:56.320
to‐to put a period
at the end of the sentence.

40:56.320 --> 41:00.950
They're looking at
a giant jigsaw puzzle

41:00.950 --> 41:03.210
with only a few pieces
that are there.

41:03.210 --> 41:06.630
But they're drawing
huge conclusions

41:06.630 --> 41:09.380
without really seeing
all the evidence.

41:09.380 --> 41:11.340
And this is a problem

41:11.340 --> 41:15.760
in trying to reconstruct
our ancient history.

41:15.760 --> 41:19.680
WILCOCK: Science is about
letting the evidence

41:19.680 --> 41:22.310
lead the investigation,
drawing conclusions

41:22.310 --> 41:24.520
based upon what you find.

41:24.520 --> 41:28.440
And the findings are undeniable:
we are not alone.

41:28.440 --> 41:30.820
Extraterrestrial,
human‐like groups have been

41:30.820 --> 41:32.610
visiting us all along.

41:35.320 --> 41:38.070
NARRATOR: Are we finally
entering a new age of science

41:38.070 --> 41:42.700
where we will be forced to
rewrite our history books?

41:42.700 --> 41:46.830
Perhaps we are finally getting
close to finding the answers

41:46.830 --> 41:50.960
to the questions that mankind
has been asking for centuries.

41:50.960 --> 41:53.920
Where did we come from?

41:53.920 --> 41:56.470
Why are we here?

41:56.470 --> 41:59.980
And are we alone
in the universe?
