About the fact
that he cheated on Katy.

19:41.347 --> 19:43.682
Oh, forget about guy code.
This was funny.

19:43.682 --> 19:45.351
I'd never tell your wife
something

19:45.351 --> 19:46.318
you didn't want her to know.

19:46.318 --> 19:48.187
Are you talking about
the other night?

19:48.187 --> 19:49.721
You wouldn't tell Katy that.

19:49.721 --> 19:51.590
Wouldn't tell me what?

19:52.791 --> 19:55.261
[♪♪♪♪♪♪]

19:58.697 --> 19:59.665
Well, in the back of my mind,

19:59.665 --> 20:03.101
I always knew
Ray was gonna be a tool.

20:03.101 --> 20:06.372
Just toss him in the shed
like the rest of them.

20:06.738 --> 20:08.374
I don't know
how you just stood there

20:08.374 --> 20:10.442
while he lied his way
out of it.

20:10.442 --> 20:12.578
Had to. Guy code.

20:12.578 --> 20:16.348
So under guy code, a guy cheats
and lies, no problem?

20:16.348 --> 20:19.184
Tells your wife
you're eating poorly,

20:19.184 --> 20:19.718
dead to you.

20:19.718 --> 20:24.456
Guy code is very clear
on fried cheese.

20:24.623 --> 20:27.726
At least we still have Adam
and Jennifer to hang out with.

20:27.726 --> 20:29.194
Who's Jennifer?

20:29.194 --> 20:33.098
Hey, look, we're no worse off
than we were before.

20:33.098 --> 20:35.234
And I was pretty happy then.

20:35.234 --> 20:36.468
Aw, thank you.

20:36.468 --> 20:39.705
Wait till you're stuck
in a lighthouse with me.

20:39.705 --> 20:41.006
Won't be so bad.

20:41.006 --> 20:43.709
If we get bored,
we can turn off the big light

20:43.709 --> 20:46.545
and watch the ships
bang into each other.

20:46.545 --> 20:48.414
[GIGGLES]

20:50.816 --> 20:54.185
Speaking of banging
into each other...

20:54.185 --> 20:56.655
[♪♪♪♪♪♪]

21:00.058 --> 21:00.659
This is nice.

21:00.659 --> 21:03.262
Yeah,
it's like a picnic.

21:03.262 --> 21:04.463
[LAUGHS]

21:04.463 --> 21:07.666
So every day, huh?

21:09.668 --> 21:11.202
I think it's a fair compromise.

21:11.202 --> 21:14.940
I'm glad Danielle got
my memo about Muumuu Monday.

21:17.042 --> 21:19.010
[RINGS]

21:19.110 --> 21:20.612
Hot 97 rocks my world.

21:20.612 --> 21:22.514
Oh, my God!
Are you serious?

21:22.514 --> 21:23.582
That's right, little lady.

21:23.582 --> 21:26.117
You've answered
with the phrase that pays.

21:26.117 --> 21:28.186
You've won a lot of money,
so why don't you go down

21:28.186 --> 21:33.091
to your boss's office and
tell him you're outta there?

21:33.091 --> 21:36.662
Check and time for me to mate.

21:37.195 --> 21:39.665
