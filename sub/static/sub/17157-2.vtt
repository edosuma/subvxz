WEBVTT

00:08.300 --> 00:09.467
- School's about to start.
What's your ETA?

00:09.467 --> 00:11.600
- Coming in hot in three,
two...

00:15.567 --> 00:17.833
- The bell's going
to ring in 20 seconds.

00:17.833 --> 00:19.133
- I'm not worried.

00:19.133 --> 00:20.433
I've got the best pit crew
in the business.

00:20.433 --> 00:21.600
- Aww.

00:21.600 --> 00:23.800
Uh-oh.
We've got a situation.

00:23.800 --> 00:25.067
- Don't worry about the hair.

00:25.067 --> 00:26.067
There's no time.

00:26.067 --> 00:28.067
Oh, boy.
Do your thing.

00:28.067 --> 00:30.867
- No sweat.
I've got this.

00:30.867 --> 00:32.033
All right.

00:32.033 --> 00:33.900
Oh, my gosh,
here comes Freddy.

00:33.900 --> 00:37.200
I hope he notices me.

00:37.200 --> 00:38.833
- Of course he'll notice you.

00:38.833 --> 00:41.633
You're smart,
you're generous, you're great.

00:41.633 --> 00:42.867
Just act cool.

00:42.867 --> 00:44.400
- Of course.

00:44.400 --> 00:47.633
Hi, Freddy.
- Ow, my eyes!

00:49.467 --> 00:51.700
- That wasn't cool, was it?

00:51.700 --> 00:53.200
- At least he noticed you.

00:53.200 --> 00:55.300
[school bell rings]

00:55.300 --> 00:57.933
- * Stop tellin' me
to read between the lines *

00:57.933 --> 01:00.433
* It all adds up
to one thing *

01:00.433 --> 01:01.933
- Five, four, three,
two, one.

01:01.933 --> 01:04.500
* If you think you're gonna
lose your cool *

01:04.500 --> 01:06.833
* Well, sometimes you gotta
break the rules *

01:06.833 --> 01:10.100
* Hey, show me what you know,
give it up to rock 'n' roll *

01:10.100 --> 01:11.467
* 'Cause we ain't
gonna stop *

01:11.467 --> 01:13.067
*

01:13.067 --> 01:15.400
* If you're feeling like
you're gettin' schooled *

01:15.400 --> 01:17.667
* There's a answer
right in front of you *

01:17.667 --> 01:20.767
* Hey, show me what you know,
give it up to rock 'n' roll *

01:20.767 --> 01:22.467
* 'Cause we ain't
gonna stop *

01:22.467 --> 01:24.667
- * Hey!
- * Are you ready to rock?

01:28.533 --> 01:30.133
- Check out this
new voice-changing app.

01:30.133 --> 01:33.900
It can make me sound super cool,
like Dr. Timewarp.

01:33.900 --> 01:37.600
I am Dr. Timewarp,
here to save lives.

01:37.600 --> 01:39.300
- [woman's voice]
I am Dr. Timewarp,

01:39.300 --> 01:42.200
here to save lives.

01:42.200 --> 01:46.433
- Oops, I set it to supermodel
instead of superhero.

01:53.800 --> 01:57.267
- Sorry, guys. Turns out they
lock the doors after 8:15.

01:57.267 --> 02:00.200
[scoffs]

02:00.200 --> 02:02.633
- Should we tell him the side
door is always unlocked?

02:02.633 --> 02:05.067
- No, this way's more fun.

02:05.067 --> 02:06.967
- Listen up,
students of rock.

02:06.967 --> 02:09.367
We've been doing stuff your
old teacher's way for a week,

02:09.367 --> 02:12.267
but if we're going to be ready
for Battle of the Bands,

02:12.267 --> 02:14.500
we need a new schedule.

02:17.267 --> 02:19.500
We're gonna cram
all the boring subjects

02:19.500 --> 02:21.500
into the first half hour
of the day,

02:21.500 --> 02:24.967
science, math, whatever.

02:24.967 --> 02:26.600
Then we're gonna spend
the rest of the day

02:26.600 --> 02:29.733
on rock appreciation,
the history of rock,

02:29.733 --> 02:34.167
and then take a break
and just talk about rock.

02:34.167 --> 02:36.567
- Mr. Finn, maybe you're not
the right person

02:36.567 --> 02:37.967
to teach us academics.

02:37.967 --> 02:40.100
Instead, we should all pick
study partners.

02:40.100 --> 02:41.567
Who should be
my study partner?

02:41.567 --> 02:42.867
I'll just pick
the first person

02:42.867 --> 02:44.533
who comes to mind
completely randomly.

02:44.533 --> 02:47.233
Freddy.

02:47.233 --> 02:50.067
- Sorry, I wasn't listening,
dirt bike magazine.

02:50.067 --> 02:53.067
- That's so cool,
a bike made of dirt.

02:53.067 --> 02:55.100
- No,
the bikes ride on dirt.

02:55.100 --> 02:59.467
- Once again,
my imagination beats reality.

02:59.467 --> 03:01.367
- All right, everybody
gather round.

03:01.367 --> 03:03.767
Listen to this sweet riff.

03:05.300 --> 03:06.700
- Nice try with Freddy.

03:06.700 --> 03:08.200
- I've got to get him
to connect with me

03:08.200 --> 03:10.133
the way he does with you.
- It's easy.

03:10.133 --> 03:12.400
We just talk about
skateboards and dirt bikes.

03:12.400 --> 03:15.300
- Oh, Freddy
likes things on wheels.

03:15.300 --> 03:16.800
- Who doesn't?

03:16.800 --> 03:18.167
- Tomika, you've got
to teach me

03:18.167 --> 03:20.767
everything you know
about skateriding.

03:20.767 --> 03:22.467
- Skateboarding.

03:22.467 --> 03:24.933
- See, I'm already learning.

03:26.067 --> 03:28.200
[rock music]

03:29.933 --> 03:32.267
- I did it!
I am awesome at this.

03:32.267 --> 03:35.300
- That's good.
Now try it on the board.

03:37.267 --> 03:40.067
- Thank you so much
for doing this, Tomeeks.

03:40.067 --> 03:42.100
- Hey, what are
best friends for?

03:42.100 --> 03:43.267
- [whimpers]

03:43.267 --> 03:44.933
Are you sure
you can't send him a note,

03:44.933 --> 03:47.100
like we used to do
in fourth grade?

03:47.100 --> 03:48.067
"I like you.

03:48.067 --> 03:49.467
Check this box if you like me.

03:49.467 --> 03:51.433
Check this box if you don't."

03:51.433 --> 03:53.500
That box made everything
crystal clear.

03:53.500 --> 03:55.133
[thuds]
- [whimpers]

03:55.133 --> 03:58.433
All I need to do is look super
extreme and cute right now.

03:58.433 --> 04:00.900
Help me adjust my butt pad.

04:00.900 --> 04:03.500
- No time.
He's here. Bye.

04:03.500 --> 04:05.167
- [whimpering]

04:05.167 --> 04:07.267
- Look out for the cord.
- [screams]

04:07.267 --> 04:08.733
[thuds]

04:08.733 --> 04:11.633
Hi, Freddy.

04:11.633 --> 04:13.700
- Did someone
just call my name?

04:13.700 --> 04:15.333
Hey, Tomika.

04:15.333 --> 04:17.733
- Check out this video.
It's a dog eating pudding

04:17.733 --> 04:20.333
and he's wearing a bow tie.

04:24.667 --> 04:26.367
- Are you okay?
- No.

04:26.367 --> 04:28.767
He didn't even notice me.

04:28.767 --> 04:32.833
- On the plus side,
that was awesome.

04:32.833 --> 04:36.067
[rock music]

04:36.067 --> 04:37.533
- Are you all right,
Mr. Finn?

04:37.533 --> 04:39.067
- I'm just nervous.

04:39.067 --> 04:40.500
I've been without
my favorite guitar,

04:40.500 --> 04:42.533
Joan Jett,
for four months.

04:42.533 --> 04:45.367
What if my old bandmate doesn't
want to sell it back to me?

04:45.367 --> 04:46.800
- No worries, Mr. Finn.

04:46.800 --> 04:49.167
My dad taught me
how to negotiate.

04:49.167 --> 04:51.133
My neighbor once asked him
for a cup of sugar,

04:51.133 --> 04:54.300
and we ended up
with her house.

04:54.300 --> 04:56.667
- You're my guy, Zack.

04:56.667 --> 05:00.133
There's Joan Jett.
- Hey, Dewey.

05:00.133 --> 05:02.367
- Pete Wentz
from Fall Out Boy?

05:02.367 --> 05:04.267
- Where?
- You.

05:04.267 --> 05:07.067
- No, I'm Colton Stubner
from the band

05:07.067 --> 05:08.200
The Dewey Finn Experience.

05:08.200 --> 05:10.433
- You kept the name
even after I quit?

05:10.433 --> 05:11.600
- Yeah, we kept the name.

05:11.600 --> 05:14.333
We didn't want
to confuse our fan.

05:14.333 --> 05:15.833
You want your guitar?

05:15.833 --> 05:18.267
I'll take double.
- Why?

05:18.267 --> 05:21.067
- Because sign spinning
doesn't pay like it used to,

05:21.067 --> 05:23.500
and I'm also kind of a jerk.

05:23.500 --> 05:26.167
- Mr. Finn
doesn't want it that bad.

05:26.167 --> 05:28.667
- Yes, I do.
- Trust me.

05:28.667 --> 05:30.433
This guy twirls a sign
for a living.

05:30.433 --> 05:31.800
He'll take the money.

05:31.800 --> 05:33.667
I am very good at this.

05:33.667 --> 05:35.067
- He is.

05:35.067 --> 05:38.800
He once got me to pay $15
for my own lunch.

05:38.800 --> 05:40.833
- Deep breath.

05:40.833 --> 05:43.067
Three, two, one.

05:43.067 --> 05:45.500
- All right, all right,
I'll take the original price.

05:45.500 --> 05:48.900
- Oh, thank Clapton!

05:48.900 --> 05:51.100
Now that I've got
Joan Jett back,

05:51.100 --> 05:53.333
we're gonna crush you
at Battle of the Bands.

05:53.333 --> 05:57.233
- We got a new singer, and we're
gonna blow your band away.

05:57.233 --> 05:59.467
- Well, we got a killer
new singer too,

05:59.467 --> 06:02.300
named Sign-ey.

06:02.300 --> 06:04.767
- You're saying
that because I'm holding a sign.

06:04.767 --> 06:08.333
- No, he or she
is totally real.

06:08.333 --> 06:09.767
- Yeah.

06:09.767 --> 06:11.233
Otherwise, why would I
be willing to bet Joan Jett

06:11.233 --> 06:13.300
we win Battle of the Bands?

06:13.300 --> 06:15.067
- You're on.

06:16.133 --> 06:17.800
- Please tell me
one of you can sing

06:17.800 --> 06:21.367
and is cool with changing
your name to Sign-ey.

06:21.367 --> 06:24.133
[rock music]

06:24.133 --> 06:25.567
- [woman's voice]
Hello, Zack.

06:25.567 --> 06:28.200
You're so cool.
- Why, thank you.

06:28.200 --> 06:30.533
- I'll bet anything
you're getting into Yale.

06:30.533 --> 06:31.833
- [chuckles]

06:31.833 --> 06:33.267
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

06:33.267 --> 06:37.600
Your laptop just came on
and started acting crazy.

06:37.600 --> 06:39.067
- That's not how it works.

06:39.067 --> 06:41.467
You have to record your voice
into the computer

06:41.467 --> 06:43.133
for it to say it back.

06:43.133 --> 06:46.067
- [laughs]
Huh. Weird.

06:48.433 --> 06:51.967
- You're cuter than Freddy
and smarter than Lawren--

06:56.300 --> 06:57.433
- That's right.

06:57.433 --> 07:00.933
I just kissed a guitar,
and I liked it.

07:00.933 --> 07:02.300
Listen up, guys.

07:02.300 --> 07:04.733
It is very, very urgent
that we find a singer

07:04.733 --> 07:09.167
that kicks butt and is cool with
changing their name to Sign-ey.

07:09.167 --> 07:12.933
Point is, we need a great
singer, aside from yours truly,

07:12.933 --> 07:15.233
that can melt faces
at Battle of the Bands.

07:15.233 --> 07:17.567
Harmony is the heart
and soul of the band.

07:17.567 --> 07:20.467
- You said electric guitar is
the heart and soul of the band.

07:20.467 --> 07:22.333
- You said
that about lighting too.

07:22.333 --> 07:25.067
- Mm-hmm.
- And sweatbands.

07:25.067 --> 07:28.567
- Guys, what's important is
we do what's best for the band.

07:28.567 --> 07:30.133
- Yeah, Freddy's right.

07:30.133 --> 07:31.633
We're gonna need
a great singer.

07:31.633 --> 07:34.067
- I actually just said that.

07:34.067 --> 07:35.567
- I agree with Freddy.

07:35.567 --> 07:38.500
We need someone to melt faces
at Battle of the Bands.

07:38.500 --> 07:39.867
- I said melt faces.

07:39.867 --> 07:42.233
You're directly quoting me.

07:42.233 --> 07:45.267
- It doesn't matter who said it.
- It was me.

07:45.267 --> 07:47.300
- We're having the best time
of our lives in this class,

07:47.300 --> 07:48.833
and I don't want
that to stop.

07:48.833 --> 07:50.900
Someone needs to step up
and be our singer.

07:53.067 --> 07:55.500
- And melt faces.

07:55.500 --> 07:58.667
- I thought of a new way
to get Freddy's attention.

07:58.667 --> 08:00.400
- I am not lending you
my bike.

08:00.400 --> 08:04.567
I care about your safety
and my bike.

08:04.567 --> 08:06.567
- No, I'm gonna be
the singer.

08:06.567 --> 08:09.267
I'll tease out my hair,
I'll use my mom's makeup,

08:09.267 --> 08:11.067
and then I'll wear
glittery outfits.

08:11.067 --> 08:12.533
Next thing you know,

08:12.533 --> 08:15.633
[off-key]
* I'm a singer *

08:15.633 --> 08:17.267
- That really is a great idea.

08:17.267 --> 08:20.233
But you know, the thing
about being a singer is--

08:20.233 --> 08:21.933
how do I put this gently--

08:21.933 --> 08:24.467
you've got to be able to sing.

08:24.467 --> 08:27.733
- No offense, Tomeeks, but do
you know anything about singing?

08:27.733 --> 08:29.467
- A little.

08:29.467 --> 08:33.367
* I know you lie,
'cause your lips are moving *

08:33.367 --> 08:36.800
* Tell me,
do you think I'm dumb? *

08:36.800 --> 08:39.967
- Why didn't you tell me
you have such a beautiful voice?

08:39.967 --> 08:42.067
OMG, this is great news.

08:42.067 --> 08:44.300
- Really?
You think I should sing?

08:44.300 --> 08:46.400
- No, I think you
should teach me how to sing.

08:46.400 --> 08:47.600
- Oh.

08:49.900 --> 08:53.433
- Remember, it's all about
breath, intonation, and control.

08:53.433 --> 08:55.733
Now relax
and just let it flow.

08:55.733 --> 08:57.300
[clears throat]

08:57.300 --> 08:59.233
- [off-key] * You can buy me
diamond earrings *

08:59.233 --> 09:03.400
* And deny, ny,
deny *

09:04.767 --> 09:06.567
- I'm not even sure
how you get that sound

09:06.567 --> 09:09.800
out of the mouth part
of your body.

09:09.800 --> 09:11.800
Here.
This is a pitch pipe.

09:11.800 --> 09:13.933
It gives you the right note.

09:14.800 --> 09:16.400
Now sing, quick.

09:16.400 --> 09:17.867
- [off-key] * I know you lie
- Stop, stop, stop.

09:17.867 --> 09:20.633
- Yeah, that pitch pipe
threw me off.

09:20.633 --> 09:22.633
Something's wrong with it.

09:22.633 --> 09:25.067
- Let's break it down.
Try doing this.

09:25.067 --> 09:27.167
* Moving

09:27.167 --> 09:29.533
- [off-key]
* Moving

09:29.533 --> 09:31.900
- Let's break
it down more.

09:31.900 --> 09:33.333
* Move

09:33.333 --> 09:36.433
- [off-key] * Move

09:38.200 --> 09:41.200
- [off-key] *Moo *

09:43.633 --> 09:44.933
- * Mm

09:44.933 --> 09:47.300
- [off-key] * Mm

09:47.300 --> 09:50.533
- Really?
Is that how I sound to you?

09:50.533 --> 09:51.967
- You know,
maybe I just need a run into it.

09:51.967 --> 09:53.633
Give me a lead-in.

09:53.633 --> 09:57.500
- * You can buy me diamond
earrings and deny, ny, ny *

09:57.500 --> 10:00.500
* Ny, ny, ny,
deny ny, *

10:00.500 --> 10:03.567
- See, the drummer
from Def Leppard has one arm.

10:03.567 --> 10:05.567
I'm not saying go out
and lose an arm.

10:05.567 --> 10:07.600
I'm saying
you should be twice as good.

10:07.600 --> 10:11.367

but I ain't stupid *

10:11.367 --> 10:13.300

10:13.300 --> 10:14.733
- I don't know.
- * With your tongue

10:14.733 --> 10:18.267
* I gave you bass,
you gave me sweet talk *

10:18.267 --> 10:21.367
* Saying how
I'm your number one *

10:21.367 --> 10:25.400
* But I know you lie
'cause your lips are moving *

10:25.400 --> 10:28.533
- It's our new singer,
that's who. Let's go.

10:29.633 --> 10:31.100
- Why aren't you
jumping in?

10:31.100 --> 10:34.033
- In my head,
that is what I sound like.

10:34.033 --> 10:37.100
- Your head
is really letting you down.

10:37.100 --> 10:40.333
- OMG.
I'm tone deaf.

10:40.333 --> 10:42.267
That's not going
to impress Freddy.

10:42.267 --> 10:45.167
- You even said that off-key.

10:45.167 --> 10:48.067
- Wow. Whose pipes
just blew my mind?

10:48.067 --> 10:50.533
- Summer.
- Hi.

10:50.533 --> 10:54.400
- It was you?
- She's been taking lessons.

10:54.400 --> 10:56.133
- Summer,
you're our new singer.

10:56.133 --> 10:57.433
Tomorrow,
after the boring stuff,

10:57.433 --> 10:59.600
I want you to show the class
what you got.

10:59.600 --> 11:01.200
I'm pumped.

11:01.200 --> 11:03.367
Also, we're gonna
start calling you Sign-ey.

11:03.367 --> 11:06.867
- Wow, Summer.
- Sign-ey.

11:06.867 --> 11:08.533
- I'm really impressed.

11:08.533 --> 11:11.667
I can't wait to hear you sing
in front of the whole class.

11:11.667 --> 11:13.333
- Yay.

11:13.333 --> 11:14.867
What am I going to do now?

11:14.867 --> 11:19.233
- * I don't know,
don't have a clue *

11:19.233 --> 11:22.767
* Guess I should've
thought it through *

11:22.767 --> 11:27.500
[rock music]

11:27.500 --> 11:28.933
- You know, It was really nice
of you to tell Freddy

11:28.933 --> 11:30.067
I was a great singer,

11:30.067 --> 11:32.933
but now I have to be
a great singer.

11:32.933 --> 11:35.100
- I know,
I was trying to help.

11:35.100 --> 11:36.533
I guess we have to come clean.

11:36.533 --> 11:39.367
- No. Didn't you see the way
he looked at me?

11:39.367 --> 11:40.933
It was as if I had wheels,

11:40.933 --> 11:43.400
and he was standing on me.

11:43.400 --> 11:47.733
- That sounds
so romantic and painful.

11:47.733 --> 11:50.400
What are we gonna do now?
- What's shaking, ladies?

11:50.400 --> 11:52.700
- Maybe technology
can help us.

11:52.700 --> 11:56.600
Lawrence, you're just the guy
we wanted to see.

11:56.600 --> 12:00.067
- Really? No girl
has ever said that to me.

12:00.067 --> 12:03.700
Doing three push-ups
a morning is really paying off.

12:03.700 --> 12:05.733

12:05.733 --> 12:09.867
- [off-key] * Tell me,
do you think I'm dumb? *

12:09.867 --> 12:12.200
- Now I'll play back
Summer's singing,

12:12.200 --> 12:14.733
and the voice app will make her
sound more like Meghan Trainor

12:14.733 --> 12:18.400
and less like a whale giving
birth to an even bigger whale.

12:18.400 --> 12:20.400
- You know,
I'm going to ignore that

12:20.400 --> 12:22.100
because you're helping me.

12:22.100 --> 12:26.400
- You said I was helping
"save the world."

12:26.400 --> 12:29.300
- Yes.
Yes, that's is right,

12:29.300 --> 12:31.067
but you know we
can't talk about it.

12:31.067 --> 12:34.133
- Can you at least
give me a hint what it's about?

12:34.133 --> 12:36.667
Just one word?
- Cyborg.

12:36.667 --> 12:39.067
- Yes, I knew it.

12:39.067 --> 12:43.867
- * I know you're lyin',

12:43.867 --> 12:46.267
- I sound great.
- Yeah, you do.

12:55.200 --> 12:58.167
The guys at the Genius Counter
are never gonna believe this.

13:01.767 --> 13:03.367
- I guess that's it.

13:03.367 --> 13:06.467
I've got to face Freddy
and tell him I'm not a singer.

13:06.467 --> 13:09.167
- Hey,
who's our new singer?

13:09.167 --> 13:12.633
- I am.

13:12.633 --> 13:13.800
[sighs]

13:13.800 --> 13:15.767
- I don't know
how I'm gonna do it,

13:15.767 --> 13:18.567
but you are gonna
sound amazing tomorrow.

13:18.567 --> 13:22.200

out of warranty?

so much different.

- Mm-hmm.

14:49.467 --> 14:52.333
- I'm so confused.

14:52.333 --> 14:55.900

be angry at the real villain.

that attacked Tomika.

15:02.300 --> 15:04.467
I'm sorry.

15:05.533 --> 15:08.467
- Give it up for Summer.

15:08.467 --> 15:13.100
- Tomika,
that was your voice?

15:13.100 --> 15:15.567
- It was awesome!

15:15.567 --> 15:18.133
- [exhales]
For a second, my heart dropped

15:18.133 --> 15:21.333
out of my body when
I realized Summer was a fake.

15:21.333 --> 15:23.900
But Tomika can sing,
so we're good.

15:23.900 --> 15:26.667
Let's hear it, Tomika.
- No way.

15:26.667 --> 15:28.500
I'm not singing.
- What?

15:28.500 --> 15:30.600
- It's not for me,
Mr. Finn.

15:30.600 --> 15:33.233
Summer wants to sing.
I don't.

15:33.233 --> 15:36.867
- Come on, Tomika.
We need you.

15:36.867 --> 15:38.700
- Do it for the band.

15:38.700 --> 15:42.533
- Please, I bet my most
precious possession,

15:42.533 --> 15:44.867
my guitar, Joan Jett,

15:44.867 --> 15:46.633
and if you don't sing,
I'm gonna lose her

in Austin,

15:49.500 --> 15:53.533

to accept the consequences.

I can bet instead of my guitar.

Do you think
Colton would take this?

16:37.300 --> 16:38.800

16:38.800 --> 16:42.200
- I think it used to be
a sandwich or maybe a shoe.

- Mr. Finn,
get a hold of yourself.

16:44.200 --> 16:46.300
You can't show your emotions.

16:46.300 --> 16:49.067
You give up
all your negotiating power.

16:49.067 --> 16:50.833
- Let me guess,
you just called me up

16:50.833 --> 16:52.733
because you realized
your band stinks,

16:52.733 --> 16:54.467
now you want to call off
this bet?

In fact,
Freddy smells amazing.

you haven't smelled him.

That's hilarious.

You couldn't get real musicians,
so you got a bunch of kids.

did you just call me "a baby"?

do you play, Nursery rhymes?

to get to me, but it won't work.

to get to you.

Mr. Finn's guitar.

We're betting his van too.

- Deal.

and we bet your two most
prized possessions.

don't let your emotions

keep betting more things.

to realize why you

for you.

of the band?

everything crystal clear."

to be the singer.

you wanted to impress Freddy.

okay?

You should be up there.

19:07.300 --> 19:09.900
I'll find another way
to get Freddy to like me,

have a better friend.

what I'm doing.

20:15.933 --> 20:17.100
- Just hit it
with the stick.

20:17.100 --> 20:19.833
[cowbell tings]
Genius stick work.

20:19.833 --> 20:22.233
That's what I'm talking about.
- What?

20:22.233 --> 20:25.233
- Did you guys feel that?
I am blown away.

20:25.233 --> 20:27.533
Summer,
you're our new cowbell player.

20:27.533 --> 20:28.900
- I am?
- Yeah.

20:28.900 --> 20:31.333
Get up here, cowbellerina.

20:31.333 --> 20:33.200
Now, the cowbell's
a percussion instrument,

20:33.200 --> 20:37.233
so you got to stand
right next to the drummer.

20:38.567 --> 20:41.033
- Thanks for stepping up
for the band.

20:41.033 --> 20:42.500
- But Tomika's the singer.

20:42.500 --> 20:45.533
- Yeah,
but you talked her into it.

20:45.533 --> 20:47.033
That was pretty cool.

20:48.067 --> 20:50.600
[cowbell tings]
