00:05.900 --> 00:08.433
NARRATOR: On this episode
of Life Below Zero,

00:08.467 --> 00:10.967
Alaska braces
for winter's grip.

00:11.000 --> 00:13.267
SUE: I predict it's
gonna be really bad weather.

00:13.300 --> 00:15.433
Only the tough survive, man.

00:15.467 --> 00:18.167
NARRATOR: Andy puts his bet
on an elusive prize.

00:18.200 --> 00:19.533
ANDY:
(WHISPERS) I gotta let him
get a little closer.

00:19.567 --> 00:20.867
(GUNSHOT)

00:20.900 --> 00:23.900
NARRATOR: Sue risks thin ice
for last minute reserves.

00:23.933 --> 00:25.233
SUE: Do not fall through.

00:25.267 --> 00:27.733
NARRATOR: The Hailstones
hunt for their
community's survival.

00:27.767 --> 00:28.933
CHIP: You gotta
keep it in sight.

00:28.967 --> 00:30.367
Where'd you go?

00:30.400 --> 00:33.700
NARRATOR: And a costly mistake
could break Erik for good.

00:33.733 --> 00:36.133
ERIK: It's about
20 below zero. Oh!

00:48.100 --> 00:50.267
NARRATOR: Every autumn,
the Hailstones travel

00:50.300 --> 00:52.767
26 miles from their
home in Noorvik

00:52.800 --> 00:54.333
to Camp Kookoochaiq,

00:54.367 --> 00:56.233
where they acquire
essential resources.

00:56.267 --> 00:58.633
CHIP: Okay, you ready then?
AGNES: Let's go moose hunting.

00:58.667 --> 00:59.967
The plan today
is to go hunting.

01:00.000 --> 01:02.100
We'll see what we see.
But there's definitely
moose around.

01:02.133 --> 01:03.433
And the chances of us
coming along

01:03.467 --> 01:04.533
with one is pretty good.

01:04.567 --> 01:06.733
We like being providers
and sharing.

01:06.767 --> 01:08.400
And people treat us
good for that

01:08.433 --> 01:10.333
because that's
an adult's place.

01:10.367 --> 01:12.367
There's at least,
you know, 20 houses
we can give it away to,

01:12.400 --> 01:14.167
and everybody will have
three or four meals.

01:14.733 --> 01:16.100
And they'll reciprocate.

01:16.133 --> 01:18.467
And when I got nothing,
fresh meat will land
at my house.

01:20.300 --> 01:21.467
CHIP: Ah, we're off.

01:25.967 --> 01:27.200
We're checking
out the lakes.

01:27.233 --> 01:29.667
We're checking out
the sloughs.

01:29.700 --> 01:33.033
And the moose just naturally
walk the grassy areas.

01:33.067 --> 01:36.633
So, we'll hunt
what we see first.

01:40.333 --> 01:43.867
AGNES: Yee, yee, yee!
Watch out for that wave.

01:43.900 --> 01:45.433
(CHIP LAUGHS)

01:45.467 --> 01:47.033
CHIP: I'm tearing
this shit up.

01:48.233 --> 01:50.267
AGNES: Watch out
for that willow.

01:52.600 --> 01:53.833
Whoo!

01:54.867 --> 01:55.867
(AGNES LAUGHS)

02:00.667 --> 02:03.100
Oh, you know, we're hunting.
It's shopping.

02:03.133 --> 02:05.000
We're gonna see
what's on the aisles.

02:05.033 --> 02:07.733
We got a moose tag
and it's all good, man.

02:07.767 --> 02:09.900
You don't know
what you see till you see it.

02:09.933 --> 02:11.533
When we see it, we'll hunt it.

02:13.267 --> 02:15.000
NARRATOR: With dark
winter approaching,

02:15.033 --> 02:16.533
Chip and Agnes can't afford

02:16.567 --> 02:19.600
to return to Noorvik without
a moose in tow.

02:21.867 --> 02:22.867
AGNES: You see that?

02:27.100 --> 02:28.100
There you go.

02:33.233 --> 02:34.233
Whoo-hoo.

02:40.500 --> 02:43.267
(MOOSE CALLS)

02:46.067 --> 02:48.367
CHIP: (WHISPERS)
There it is. Shoot it.
It's looking straight at us.

02:51.567 --> 02:53.567
Do you wanna go
grab the tree
and take a brace?

02:53.600 --> 02:54.800
AGNES: Yep, I do.

02:54.833 --> 02:56.667
CHIP: Oh, don't move fast.
Don't move fast.

02:58.667 --> 03:00.900
There you go. Hurry up.

03:00.933 --> 03:02.467
AGNES: I'm trying.
It already left.

03:04.267 --> 03:05.533
CHIP: She's going.

03:06.933 --> 03:09.133
It's gonna hit the river
and swim.

03:11.567 --> 03:13.000
It's gonna
put the river between us.

03:13.033 --> 03:14.267
Put it on your shoulder.
Let's go.

03:16.900 --> 03:18.133
AGNES: There's a lake right
over here.

03:18.167 --> 03:20.767
So, it's between
the lake and the
river somewhere.

03:21.800 --> 03:23.300
He just kept on going.

03:24.433 --> 03:25.700
You see the look
on his face?

03:25.733 --> 03:27.033
-(AGNES CHUCKLES)
-He gave us one eye.

03:27.067 --> 03:28.500
And then he turned
his head and gave us
the other eye.

03:28.533 --> 03:30.167
(CHUCKLES)
Like double-checking.

03:30.200 --> 03:32.033
AGNES: Yep.
CHIP: Oh, well.

03:35.300 --> 03:36.667
Saw a nice
young bull moose.

03:36.700 --> 03:38.467
He gave us one eye
and then gave us
the other eye,

03:38.500 --> 03:39.933
and then he got
the fuck out of town.

03:39.967 --> 03:41.933
If you don't know where he is,
you really can't shoot him.

03:41.967 --> 03:43.533
Pretty hard to find them
in this tangle.

03:45.533 --> 03:46.733
So we just go on
to the next one.

03:46.767 --> 03:48.600
It's no biggie.
It's actually quite normal.

03:51.100 --> 03:52.533
Okay, let's carry on.

03:52.567 --> 03:54.500
We got a date with
a big fat moose somewhere.

03:55.333 --> 03:57.133
SUE: You prepare
for the worst

03:57.167 --> 03:59.000
and be pleasantly surprised
by the best.

03:59.033 --> 04:00.933
But if you haven't
prepared for it

04:00.967 --> 04:02.300
by the time it hits,

04:02.933 --> 04:04.433
that's a bum deal.

04:08.600 --> 04:11.300
NARRATOR: As winter
descends on Kavik,

04:11.333 --> 04:13.400
Sue Aikens faces 300 days

04:13.433 --> 04:16.167
of sheer isolation
in her remote outpost.

04:18.333 --> 04:21.067
Hey, look what showed up.

04:22.867 --> 04:24.800
(CHUCKLES) Winter came back.

04:24.833 --> 04:26.533
Seeing all the white
on the ground,

04:26.567 --> 04:27.767
it's a reminder that

04:27.800 --> 04:29.167
this isn't going anywhere.

04:29.200 --> 04:31.667
I'm losing more daylight daily

04:31.700 --> 04:33.567
and so, shut down of camp.

04:33.600 --> 04:36.567
I gotta get it buttoned up.
I've gotta know
it's buttoned up.

04:36.600 --> 04:39.600
And that means going through
each and every trailer.
Just opening it.

04:39.633 --> 04:42.133
Are the windows shut?
Is there something
I need to fix?

04:42.167 --> 04:43.933
Make a list. Get it done.

04:43.967 --> 04:46.967
I check. I double check.
I triple check.

04:47.000 --> 04:50.467
This is my last shot
before winter stays
and doesn't leave.

04:50.500 --> 04:52.100
I need to get it done today.

04:52.133 --> 04:54.367
Where I can today stand here

04:54.400 --> 04:56.500
relatively thinly dressed,

04:56.533 --> 04:59.833
that is going to change
and change rapidly.

04:59.867 --> 05:03.300
60, 70, even 100 below zero
is not unheard of.

05:03.333 --> 05:05.967
The wind picks up
and I will not be able to see

05:06.000 --> 05:07.433
this hand in front of my face.

05:07.467 --> 05:09.900
I could never walk down here
and be able to see

05:09.933 --> 05:11.500
the orange colour
of that trailer.

05:11.533 --> 05:13.000
Let alone, it's gonna be dark.

05:15.233 --> 05:17.133
Today, I have
nice temperatures,

05:17.167 --> 05:19.833
I'm getting liquid water.
It's a blessing.

05:19.867 --> 05:22.067
Just anything
to add to what I use.

05:22.100 --> 05:24.000
I normally

05:24.033 --> 05:26.767
do about a gallon
a day is what I give myself

05:26.800 --> 05:30.067
between drinking, bathing,
cooking, cleaning.

05:30.100 --> 05:32.933
Tomorrow, it'll be frozen
and a bigger challenge.

05:33.667 --> 05:37.400
Where is
an appreciable opening?

05:44.533 --> 05:47.633
The goal is that
you don't really wanna
fall through,

05:47.667 --> 05:48.733
but it could happen.

06:06.267 --> 06:08.333
Do not fall through.
Do not fall through.

06:12.500 --> 06:13.900
Here we go.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.800
I mean, water...

06:18.633 --> 06:20.833
It is precious as gold
out here.

06:21.533 --> 06:22.833
Because I'm gonna have

06:24.433 --> 06:25.767
the next 300 days

06:25.800 --> 06:28.300
without running liquid water.

06:28.333 --> 06:30.167
I'll have plenty
in the ice variety.

06:30.200 --> 06:31.500
Plenty in snow.

06:32.233 --> 06:35.067
This is not frozen yet.

06:35.100 --> 06:37.933
And this time of year,
that's kind of unheard of.

06:38.700 --> 06:40.267
So while the getting is good,

06:41.033 --> 06:42.333
I need to get my water

06:43.233 --> 06:44.900
and resupply myself.

06:45.467 --> 06:47.033
Another week, maybe two,

06:48.333 --> 06:50.033
the length of that journey

06:51.033 --> 06:52.233
could cost me
a couple of these.

06:53.500 --> 06:56.400
It is a beautifully
harsh place.

06:57.533 --> 07:00.467
And, uh, only the tough
survive, man.

07:01.867 --> 07:03.433
ANDY: The more you learn,
the more you see,

07:03.467 --> 07:06.367
the more you get out there,
the better adapted you are

07:06.400 --> 07:08.533
to harvesting
what you need out here.

07:22.533 --> 07:25.233
KATE: Well, yesterday
morning we woke up,

07:25.867 --> 07:27.433
and we had

07:27.467 --> 07:29.300
a little light snowfall.

07:30.567 --> 07:32.533
And the forecast

07:32.567 --> 07:34.833
was for snow and rain showers.

07:34.867 --> 07:37.067
When we woke up it was,

07:37.100 --> 07:39.867
holy cow,
we'd already had seven inches.

07:39.900 --> 07:42.200
But it's this wet,
horrible snow.

07:44.300 --> 07:46.267
ANDY: A cold day
on the Yukon today.

07:47.633 --> 07:50.667
We've had a very early
snowfall this year,

07:50.700 --> 07:52.467
and it's really putting a hurt

07:52.500 --> 07:53.933
on the way we do things.

07:53.967 --> 07:55.267
Everything's frozen down.

07:55.300 --> 07:57.333
Everything's buried
under the snow.

07:57.367 --> 07:58.833
I would've liked to
have harvested

07:58.867 --> 08:00.133
a little bit more meat.

08:00.167 --> 08:01.300
We got a nice moose,

08:01.333 --> 08:03.733
but today,
what's on the agenda

08:03.767 --> 08:06.100
is to go get
a couple beavers.

08:06.133 --> 08:08.433
There's a couple beaver ponds
not too far from here.

08:08.467 --> 08:10.567
And the season's open
for firearm.

08:10.600 --> 08:12.467
Once it cools off
a little bit more,

08:12.500 --> 08:15.633
with this snow,
we'll get a lot of ice forming
on the Yukon pretty quick.

08:15.667 --> 08:18.400
So I want to take
full advantage
of being able to use the boats

08:18.433 --> 08:20.567
before winter
sets in completely.

08:25.233 --> 08:26.900
Hunting beaver is
a little bit different

08:26.933 --> 08:29.867
than hunting
a lot of hooved animals.

08:29.900 --> 08:32.067
Beavers have
a pretty good sense of smell.

08:32.733 --> 08:34.200
They tend to come out

08:34.233 --> 08:35.967
in the early mornings
and late evenings.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.800
So I don't know
if they'll be out right now,

08:38.833 --> 08:40.233
but this is close
enough to home.

08:40.267 --> 08:41.633
I can always come back

08:41.667 --> 08:43.667
in the evening time
if I need to.

08:43.700 --> 08:45.467
Yeah, right now I'm carrying

08:46.633 --> 08:48.833
a .22 Magnum
for shooting the beavers.

08:48.867 --> 08:52.200
And, uh, I'm carrying my

08:52.233 --> 08:55.700
.325, in case
I run into a bear.

08:55.733 --> 08:58.867
It'd be foolish
to walk around here
with just a .22 right now.

08:59.867 --> 09:01.500
A .22 Magnum wouldn't do much

09:01.533 --> 09:04.033
against a grizzly bear,
except for piss him off.

09:04.067 --> 09:05.067
(CHUCKLES)

09:07.167 --> 09:09.400
It's a beaver chew.

09:09.433 --> 09:11.800
It's a lot of aspen
and a lot of cottonwood
right here.

09:11.833 --> 09:14.300
So, this is what
they prefer to eat.

09:14.333 --> 09:18.000
You can see
there's quite a few chews
around here.

09:19.567 --> 09:22.700
This is a pretty good
little beaver pond here.

09:22.733 --> 09:25.800
There's a good-sized
feed pile here.

09:25.833 --> 09:28.533
And I can see
the, uh, bank house here,

09:28.567 --> 09:31.733
where they've been piling
sticks up against the bank.

09:31.767 --> 09:33.867
So, there's nothing
swimming right now.

09:33.900 --> 09:35.967
I'm gonna go thump
on the water a little bit.

09:36.000 --> 09:38.267
That's kind of an alarm
for the beavers.

09:38.300 --> 09:40.900
I'll see
if that doesn't draw them out
to investigate.

09:59.433 --> 10:01.167
Looks like
everybody's napping right now.

10:01.200 --> 10:03.233
So, uh, I think it's time
to go back home,

10:03.267 --> 10:05.867
get a few more chores done.

10:05.900 --> 10:09.133
I'm hoping if I come back
late this evening,

10:09.167 --> 10:11.700
have an opportunity
to harvest one or two
of 'em.

10:13.667 --> 10:14.933
We'll see what happens.

10:16.667 --> 10:18.467
ERIK: There's a lot
of different types of people

10:18.500 --> 10:20.400
that come out
to the bush to live.

10:20.433 --> 10:21.633
You know, some people
come out here

10:21.667 --> 10:23.233
'cause they're running
from something.

10:23.267 --> 10:24.533
And everybody lives out here

10:24.567 --> 10:25.733
for their own unique reason.

10:33.833 --> 10:35.167
NARRATOR:
For much of the winter,

10:35.200 --> 10:38.767
Erik Salitan makes his living
from trapping fur.

10:38.800 --> 10:42.300
Today he's hoping
a new kind of trap
will bring him success.

10:43.467 --> 10:46.467
ERIK: Just opening up a box
of conibear 330s.

10:48.833 --> 10:50.700
This trap's different
than most of the traps I use,

10:50.733 --> 10:52.600
in that it actually
breaks the neck

10:52.633 --> 10:54.267
of the animal
and kills it instantly.

10:54.300 --> 10:56.500
Whereas most
of the traps I use
are leg holds

10:56.533 --> 10:58.233
and just catch
the animal's foot.

11:00.733 --> 11:04.700
I'm trying to
construct a box here
to put a 330 conibear in.

11:04.733 --> 11:06.300
Something I've never done.

11:06.333 --> 11:08.733
I'm not that good
of a carpenter,

11:08.767 --> 11:11.467
but I don't think
the animals will notice.

11:11.500 --> 11:12.567
(WHIRRING)

11:25.733 --> 11:27.633
Okay.

11:27.667 --> 11:30.633
I think my cubby set box
is going to work.

11:30.667 --> 11:31.800
So the idea is,

11:33.100 --> 11:36.300
the bait is placed
in the back of the cubby.

11:36.333 --> 11:39.433
The animal comes along,
he sees the bait in the back,

11:39.467 --> 11:41.900
he goes in, he hits
this trigger mechanism.

11:43.000 --> 11:45.700
Snap. It instantly kills him,

11:45.733 --> 11:49.033
and it's a real humane way
to harvest foxes
or wolverines,

11:49.067 --> 11:50.200
so I think we succeeded.

11:52.467 --> 11:54.333
Okay, now we're
gonna go to phase two

11:54.367 --> 11:56.167
which is to actually test this

11:56.200 --> 11:59.867
and make sure
that the jaws flow freely
inside the cubby box I made.

12:00.733 --> 12:02.733
Safety is now off

12:02.767 --> 12:05.067
and that is a hot,
very powerful trap.

12:08.200 --> 12:10.733
The 330 conibear here,
it's a large trap.

12:10.767 --> 12:13.200
So I'm a little bit
leery about this
son of a gun here,

12:13.233 --> 12:15.000
and definitely don't wanna
be putting my arm in there.

12:15.033 --> 12:17.233
I'm pretty sure it would
actually break your arm.

12:18.900 --> 12:20.200
And that's what happens.

12:22.167 --> 12:24.933
Jesus Christ.
That's powerful.

12:28.633 --> 12:30.500
Guess it works. (LAUGHS)

12:42.833 --> 12:44.200
ERIK: So I'm excited
to give it a try.

12:44.233 --> 12:46.433
You know, everything up here
is trial and error,

12:46.467 --> 12:48.733
but with error, you know,
there's a price to be paid.

12:48.767 --> 12:49.967
So, if I waste

12:50.000 --> 12:51.133
part of the trapping season

12:51.167 --> 12:53.400
fooling around
with these cubby boxes
and conibears,

12:53.433 --> 12:54.733
and I don't have any success,

12:54.767 --> 12:56.333
that's time wasted,
fur I didn't catch.

12:56.367 --> 12:59.167
And if I'm not catching fur,
I'm wasting money.

12:59.200 --> 13:01.333
And I'm not into
wasting anything up here.

13:23.233 --> 13:25.567
Using my
handy trap setter here

13:25.600 --> 13:27.400
and trying not to
break my arm.

13:28.833 --> 13:31.633
So I'm learning as I go

13:31.667 --> 13:33.633
and whenever you're
learning anything new,

13:33.667 --> 13:35.333
there's a learning curve.

13:35.367 --> 13:37.500
Gotta pay
really close attention here.

13:37.533 --> 13:40.700
You make a mistake,
cost you a finger or worse.

13:40.733 --> 13:43.533
So to be honest,
I am kind of scared
of these traps.

13:43.567 --> 13:45.567
I'm just not
very experienced with them.

13:45.600 --> 13:47.667
So, I try to use
a lot of caution.

13:47.700 --> 13:50.700
It's pretty cold right now.
It's about 20 below zero...

13:51.100 --> 13:52.300
Oh!

13:52.333 --> 13:53.867
That wasn't cool.

13:58.300 --> 13:59.633
Oh, fuck.

14:03.667 --> 14:05.633
Well, I caught my hand in it.

14:08.467 --> 14:10.433
Didn't feel particularly good.

14:12.167 --> 14:15.667
Oh, yeah, that...
I guess that's part
of the learning curve.

14:23.367 --> 14:25.367
Forced to work
without a glove right now,

14:25.400 --> 14:27.067
to get my glove
out of the trap.

14:28.133 --> 14:29.733
It's not all that fun.

14:31.267 --> 14:32.900
Stupid shit like that,

14:32.933 --> 14:36.133
where you are operating
when you're tired.

14:38.567 --> 14:39.733
(EXHALES)

14:39.767 --> 14:40.933
In the cold,

14:42.000 --> 14:43.900
doing stuff by yourself.

14:44.667 --> 14:46.600
You smash your hand open.

14:46.633 --> 14:49.233
You can get yourself
in trouble out here so...

14:51.567 --> 14:54.133
(SIGHS) At least my arm's
not stuck in it.

14:56.200 --> 14:58.400
Using my body here
as leverage.

14:59.433 --> 15:02.433
This hand isn't feeling
too good.

15:02.467 --> 15:05.367
You may notice my leeriness
around the traps now.
(CHUCKLES)

15:14.967 --> 15:16.467
This one should be
a good one.

15:16.500 --> 15:19.067
I got piece of
a moose skull in there.

15:24.033 --> 15:25.333
(SIGHS)

15:25.367 --> 15:29.733
Come back here
in a few days and maybe
we'll have gotten lucky.

15:29.767 --> 15:32.367
Learnt a good lesson here
with these 330s.

15:33.367 --> 15:34.700
Kinda I guess reminding myself

15:34.733 --> 15:37.233
why I never
fooled with 'em in the past.

15:37.267 --> 15:40.767
They're frickin' dangerous.
I'm happy all it had
was my hand.

15:45.667 --> 15:47.100
SUE: I've heard the term,

15:47.133 --> 15:49.533
"Walking around
in a dreamlike state."

15:49.567 --> 15:51.100
I don't wanna
sleep through life.

15:51.133 --> 15:52.367
I can dream when I'm dead.

15:59.467 --> 16:01.833
NARRATOR: With the deep freeze
fast approaching,

16:01.867 --> 16:03.533
Sue's racing
to make sure her camp

16:03.567 --> 16:06.533
can withstand
the harsh Arctic conditions.

16:06.567 --> 16:08.900
SUE: You know, for the last
10, 11 years,

16:08.933 --> 16:10.167
I've been living
in a corner

16:10.200 --> 16:12.433
of the dining hall year round.

16:12.467 --> 16:15.833
This year
I put up this building

16:15.867 --> 16:19.000
so that I had
some personal space.

16:20.500 --> 16:22.667
Any time
you put up a new structure,

16:22.700 --> 16:25.833
you've gotta lessen
any of the imperfect contact.

16:25.867 --> 16:27.833
You know, where's the wind
gonna come in?

16:27.867 --> 16:30.833
These winds are gonna hit me
at 100 miles an hour maybe.

16:30.867 --> 16:32.867
Cold air is gonna come
barrelling in.

16:32.900 --> 16:34.767
And if there's any
little tiny hole,

16:34.800 --> 16:38.233
snow is gonna come
barrelling in and make
a huge drift in here.

16:38.267 --> 16:41.333
For my own safety,
my own comfort,

16:41.367 --> 16:44.267
I've gotta start foaming
as much as I can.

16:44.300 --> 16:46.133
There's no way
I'm gonna be able to get

16:46.167 --> 16:48.067
each and every
tiny little crevice.

16:49.033 --> 16:50.967
But I'll get the ones
that I can see,

16:51.000 --> 16:53.767
and I'll discover more
as the winter goes on.

16:53.800 --> 16:56.167
It's gonna be
a new experience for me.

16:56.200 --> 16:57.633
This is my... This is like

16:57.667 --> 16:59.700
walking into Kavik all over.
Day one.

17:04.367 --> 17:06.167
Is this gonna be
very pretty? No.

17:06.200 --> 17:08.233
Is it going to be
effective? Yes.

17:11.000 --> 17:13.633
You know, and am I
perfect at doing
this stuff? Nope.

17:15.067 --> 17:17.100
But little by little,

17:17.133 --> 17:18.967
Miss Gomer Pyle
makes it happen.

17:20.300 --> 17:23.767
Personally, every single
damn year that I'm here,

17:24.267 --> 17:25.700
I'm a greenhorn.

17:25.733 --> 17:27.533
And there is gonna
be something

17:27.567 --> 17:29.667
that nature or life
shows me...

17:31.333 --> 17:34.067
Entirely new.
It's all the unknowns.

17:34.100 --> 17:36.100
Which is thrilling,

17:36.133 --> 17:39.233
but at the same time, spooky.

17:47.167 --> 17:48.833
I've been hearing a noise...

17:48.867 --> 17:50.933
(IMITATES METAL CLANKING)

17:50.967 --> 17:52.767
In the wind.
It's bothering me.

17:52.800 --> 17:54.633
(CLANKING)

17:54.667 --> 17:57.467
This'll have to be
secured down.

17:57.500 --> 18:00.133
Or it will get torn off
in the winds

18:00.167 --> 18:02.033
and possibly tear into
one of my tents.

18:02.067 --> 18:04.867
You know, I mean, you do live

18:04.900 --> 18:07.733
to a large extent
using your ears.

18:07.767 --> 18:10.933
I mean, when you're
protecting yourself,
your eyes are pretty good.

18:10.967 --> 18:14.433
But eventually it's all dark
and they don't do me
a hell of a lot of good.

18:14.467 --> 18:15.533
I listen.

18:15.567 --> 18:18.500
The footsteps coming
through the river.

18:18.533 --> 18:21.300
I can lay there in bed
and tell you,

18:21.333 --> 18:24.367
is that a wolf?
Is that a caribou?
Is that a bear?

18:24.400 --> 18:25.933
This'll help protect me.

18:25.967 --> 18:29.600
But it also helps keep camp
in one piece
instead of 10 or 12.

18:29.633 --> 18:32.267
NARRATOR: Sue relies
on her senses for survival.

18:32.300 --> 18:35.167
But they are also linked
to her darkest memory.

18:35.200 --> 18:37.067
A bear attack,
several years ago,

18:37.100 --> 18:39.767
that left her nearly dead
until help arrived.

18:39.800 --> 18:41.567
SUE: After the bear attack,

18:41.600 --> 18:43.933
when I was laying here,
I don't know how many days...

18:47.667 --> 18:50.200
And I can't move in the tent.

18:50.233 --> 18:53.367
And you can hear a bear
chewing on the skull
of something,

18:53.400 --> 18:56.267
not 10 feet away from me
on the other side of the tent.

18:56.300 --> 18:58.867
I could not move.
I could not do anything.

18:58.900 --> 19:01.333
And you're hearing,
(IMITATES BEAR GROWLING)

19:01.367 --> 19:04.267
and the huffing and they nudge
the side of the tent.

19:04.300 --> 19:07.567
Is he coming to get me next?
Is this it?

19:07.600 --> 19:09.233
Or is he just fucking with me?

19:10.067 --> 19:12.367
And, yeah, thanks.

19:12.400 --> 19:14.867
That's the most disturbing
memory that I try
not to think about.

19:18.533 --> 19:21.400
I mean, is this some kind of
a super-duper fix? No.

19:22.333 --> 19:24.567
Will it do what I'm
asking it to do?

19:26.267 --> 19:28.933
It's not gonna make
a hell of a lot of noise, no.

19:28.967 --> 19:30.467
So I mean, yeah.

19:30.500 --> 19:33.467
Fix is done.
Onto the next chore.

19:37.400 --> 19:40.233
CHIP: I enjoy myself.
I don't live up to
someone else's expectations.

19:40.267 --> 19:43.200
I don't live up to
someone else's standards.
I don't care.

19:51.267 --> 19:54.933
AGNES: Okay, moose,
you can come out now!

19:54.967 --> 19:56.967
NARRATOR: Chip and
Agnes Hailstone are stalking

19:57.000 --> 20:00.400
the Kobuk River for moose.
A crucial source of meat,

20:00.433 --> 20:03.067
for their family
as well as their community.

20:06.000 --> 20:07.200
AGNES: Just gotta go get
the moose

20:07.233 --> 20:08.433
and then we'll have moose meat

20:08.467 --> 20:10.600
and moose tongue
and moose heart

20:10.633 --> 20:12.100
and everything
to do with moose.

20:15.667 --> 20:16.667
(MOOSE CALLS)

20:19.467 --> 20:21.633
AGNES: Nope. Nothing standing.

20:22.867 --> 20:25.333
(AGNES SPEAKING)

20:25.367 --> 20:28.067
CHIP: So what we do
as we come around the corner
is we try to take them wide,

20:28.100 --> 20:30.700
so we can have
a good look at what's
around the corner.

20:30.733 --> 20:32.467
'Cause when we take them close

20:32.500 --> 20:34.067
and we jump a moose,
they just run away.

20:34.100 --> 20:36.433
We take 'em wide,
we're hoping there's a moose
around the corner,

20:36.467 --> 20:39.133
because quite often
they're out of the brush,
but this is where they live.

20:39.167 --> 20:40.933
They live in the brush.
They're very hard to detect.

20:52.367 --> 20:54.700
AGNES: Locked and loaded.

20:54.733 --> 20:56.433
We can't catch
a cow with a calf.

20:56.467 --> 20:58.500
We can only catch
a cow without a calf.

21:08.367 --> 21:10.433
CHIP: We gotta
keep it in sight.

21:10.467 --> 21:12.333
If we lose sight
of it, we got nothing.

21:43.133 --> 21:44.500
Where'd you go?

21:47.933 --> 21:50.200
Well, we're never
gonna see her in this shit.

21:50.233 --> 21:52.233
Let's go have
a cup of coffee.

21:52.267 --> 21:54.167
AGNES: Well, we're
shit out of luck for moose.

21:54.200 --> 21:56.033
I think my husband's
a little stressed out.

21:58.167 --> 21:59.433
CHIP: That was
a little too exciting.

22:01.267 --> 22:02.667
(AGNES SPEAKING)

22:04.400 --> 22:06.100
CHIP: Yeah, but she
was fat. (CHUCKLES)

22:06.133 --> 22:07.267
That was worth shooting.

22:10.733 --> 22:12.400
AGNES: Go by those trees?

22:13.967 --> 22:15.433
CHIP: Let's go back here
and have a look.

22:17.133 --> 22:19.700
Oh, man, there's a trail
and a half right here.

22:21.200 --> 22:23.800
We don't have any money.
I need moose

22:23.833 --> 22:25.867
in order to get other things.

22:28.133 --> 22:29.333
Moose shit.

22:36.267 --> 22:38.267
CHIP: A lot of good-sized
moose tracks.

22:38.300 --> 22:39.733
AGNES: The pressure's on...

22:41.267 --> 22:43.700
ERIK: If you wanna live out
in the bush here,

22:43.733 --> 22:45.933
there's a lot of work
associated with it

22:45.967 --> 22:48.633
and there's a certain
lifestyle that you gain

22:48.667 --> 22:50.567
and a certain lifestyle
that you lose.

22:52.033 --> 22:53.300
I wouldn't trade it
for the world.

23:05.500 --> 23:06.933
Pretty cold this morning.

23:08.167 --> 23:09.767
Looking forward
to going on a trip.

23:09.800 --> 23:11.300
Doing some trapping,

23:11.333 --> 23:13.000
but I don't think
my machine will start.

23:13.033 --> 23:14.533
Matter of fact,

23:14.567 --> 23:16.300
my kill switch is frozen.

23:16.900 --> 23:18.400
When it's this cold,

23:19.233 --> 23:21.000
can't get the machine started,

23:21.033 --> 23:23.567
I tarp it off.
Throw a space heater under it.

23:23.600 --> 23:27.033
So, see what we can
make happen here.

23:27.067 --> 23:28.600
I live a long ways
from Fairbanks,

23:28.633 --> 23:31.000
and I'm not that good
of a mechanic to begin with.

23:31.033 --> 23:32.367
If I break the machine

23:32.400 --> 23:35.233
I'm down transportation
out here.

23:35.267 --> 23:37.100
I can't haul firewood.
I can't go trapping.

23:37.867 --> 23:39.200
It's a major problem.

23:39.233 --> 23:42.633
So, it doesn't hurt it to just
give her a little preheat.

23:42.667 --> 23:44.867
I'm gonna get the tarp
over the whole machine,

23:47.433 --> 23:49.167
then kind of tighten down

23:49.200 --> 23:51.067
the sides here with snow.

23:51.933 --> 23:53.933
When it's this cold,

23:53.967 --> 23:55.833
the equipment breaks.

23:55.867 --> 23:57.267
You gotta preheat stuff.

23:58.600 --> 24:01.367
I could probably yank
on this snow machine

24:01.400 --> 24:03.767
for a while
and get her to start,

24:03.800 --> 24:05.667
but if I fire up
this generator

24:05.700 --> 24:08.967
and plug in a space heater
for 15, 20 minutes,

24:09.000 --> 24:10.933
it'll start up fairly easy,

24:10.967 --> 24:14.067
and it's a lot easier
on the machine.
It's a lot easier on me.

24:14.100 --> 24:16.367
Now everything will be nice
and warm and ready to go.

24:16.400 --> 24:19.133
But, when you're operating
in extreme cold,

24:19.933 --> 24:21.967
30, 40 below zero,

24:22.000 --> 24:23.567
everything is a pain
in the butt.

24:23.600 --> 24:26.267
I'm gonna go
and get myself warmed up.

24:26.300 --> 24:28.800
Meaning I'm gonna
have another cup of coffee.

24:45.600 --> 24:47.233
-(ENGINE STARTING)
-First pull.

24:48.033 --> 24:49.100
(ENGINE REVS)

24:49.133 --> 24:52.333
I got a long ways to go,
and I better get to it.

24:59.400 --> 25:02.867
ANDY: There's a time
of year when things are
meant to happen.

25:02.900 --> 25:04.833
If you don't do it
during that time,

25:04.867 --> 25:06.033
you're not gonna get it.

25:17.467 --> 25:19.533
ANDY: I didn't get a beaver
this morning.

25:19.567 --> 25:21.967
So I'm gonna head back
to the same ponds

25:22.000 --> 25:25.200
and hopefully there will be
some beavers out
swimming around.

25:25.233 --> 25:27.233
This might be a bit of
a waiting game tonight,

25:27.267 --> 25:29.433
but I'm gonna hunt until
it gets too dark to shoot.

25:36.767 --> 25:37.867
ANDY: I like winter.

25:37.900 --> 25:40.233
This is my favourite season
of the year.

25:40.267 --> 25:42.633
I love the fall.
And we're having a really
beautiful one this year

25:42.667 --> 25:46.100
with all these fall colours
mixed with the snow.

25:46.133 --> 25:47.433
Every year is
different up here.

25:47.467 --> 25:49.600
We just never know
from season to season.

25:49.633 --> 25:51.200
I think that's why
I love it up here.

25:53.600 --> 25:56.300
The beauty of living up here
is seeing the interaction

25:56.333 --> 25:57.967
of all the different types
of wildlife,

25:58.000 --> 26:01.667
plants, animals,
how they all interact,

26:01.700 --> 26:03.600
how they all
depend on each other,

26:03.633 --> 26:05.767
and feed off of each other.

26:05.800 --> 26:08.033
And that's fascinating to me.

26:30.567 --> 26:32.800
(WHISPERS) Look, there he is.
Get down.

26:44.233 --> 26:45.233
(GUN COCKS)

26:55.333 --> 26:57.067
(WHISPERS) I gotta let him
get a little closer

26:57.100 --> 26:58.833
to the shoreline
before I take a shot,

26:58.867 --> 27:00.900
so he's not too far out.

27:00.933 --> 27:02.600
So I can get him if they sink.

27:09.200 --> 27:10.267
(GUNSHOT)

27:14.467 --> 27:17.933
Don't sink, don't sink,
don't sink, don't sink.

27:17.967 --> 27:20.633
Oh, you son of a bitch. Fuck!

27:23.000 --> 27:24.567
So far I've never
lost a beaver

27:24.600 --> 27:25.967
hunting them this way.

27:26.000 --> 27:27.800
I don't want this
to be the first.

27:30.133 --> 27:32.800
I'm gonna see
if I can't cast out
a few times

27:34.267 --> 27:36.500
and hopefully snag him.

27:36.533 --> 27:39.000
I'll probably end up
snagging a damn branch.

27:39.033 --> 27:40.633
There's an awful
lot of stuff in the river.

27:59.333 --> 28:00.700
It sucks.

28:05.067 --> 28:06.633
Fishing for beavers.

28:06.667 --> 28:07.867
That's a first.

28:10.233 --> 28:12.467
Ooh, there's some bubbles
coming up right there.

28:27.133 --> 28:29.633
I think I got it. There we go.
I got him.

28:30.700 --> 28:32.033
Son of a bitch.

28:32.067 --> 28:34.333
Oh, is that ever
fucking lucky or what?

28:37.633 --> 28:38.733
Got him.

28:40.200 --> 28:41.567
Ooh, yeah.

28:41.600 --> 28:43.200
Well, he's not that small.

28:45.633 --> 28:47.733
Nice. Nice beaver.

28:47.767 --> 28:48.933
When I first shot him

28:48.967 --> 28:51.000
I thought he was gonna
float for me,

28:51.033 --> 28:53.033
but then he started
to sink real slow,

28:53.067 --> 28:54.400
and once
he went down in there

28:54.433 --> 28:56.467
I figured my chances were
pretty slim.

28:57.333 --> 29:00.067
But I saw some bubbles
coming up,

29:00.967 --> 29:03.600
and so...

29:03.633 --> 29:06.500
That was kind of a tell-tale
sign of where he was at.

29:08.733 --> 29:11.333
Oh, got him,
looks like I got him
right where I wanted,

29:11.367 --> 29:14.400
right in the ear.
Went in right here.

29:16.000 --> 29:17.533
Probably weighs...

29:17.567 --> 29:19.733
He's a good 40, 50
pounds anyway.

29:19.767 --> 29:20.900
40 pounds...

29:22.267 --> 29:23.800
(GRUNTS)

29:25.133 --> 29:29.200
All right, let's head back
to the hacienda.

29:31.633 --> 29:34.400
SUE: Kavik is not a place
that you look on the map

29:34.433 --> 29:36.933
and say, "I hope I live there
when I get older."

29:38.500 --> 29:41.567
It's a place that
I happened upon

29:41.600 --> 29:43.133
and developed a love for.

29:52.433 --> 29:53.700
Hey, girlfriend.

29:54.600 --> 29:56.900
You almost ready
for your walk, huh?

29:56.933 --> 29:57.967
I'm not.

29:58.000 --> 29:59.167
I still got work to do.

29:59.200 --> 30:01.933
Ermine is an older,

30:01.967 --> 30:04.667
retired sled dog.
She is companionship.

30:04.700 --> 30:06.133
She is quite old.

30:06.167 --> 30:08.067
She may not make it.

30:08.100 --> 30:09.800
She may not have an extremely

30:09.833 --> 30:11.967
long journey with me,

30:12.000 --> 30:13.667
and I knew that going into it.

30:13.700 --> 30:15.900
I don't form attachments

30:15.933 --> 30:18.133
other than superficial ones
with my foxes.

30:19.033 --> 30:22.800
This is
a committed relationship

30:22.833 --> 30:25.967
to something old
that won't be here long.

30:26.000 --> 30:27.967
So it is

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
inviting something social
into my world,

30:30.033 --> 30:32.767
but she's not asking me
to compromise
my values to have her.

30:33.333 --> 30:34.533
Gotta put away the fuel.

30:38.067 --> 30:40.100
(SIGHS) What I'm doing now,

30:40.933 --> 30:42.967
I need to bring those

30:43.000 --> 30:45.267
barrels of unleaded fuel

30:45.300 --> 30:47.667
from the outside
to the inside.

30:47.700 --> 30:50.133
I have barrels of
unleaded out here.

30:50.167 --> 30:51.667
It's in the weather right now.

30:51.700 --> 30:53.200
I need to get it out
of the weather.

30:53.233 --> 30:54.600
If I leave it sit there,

30:54.633 --> 30:56.700
it's gonna be buried
under a 20-foot drift.

30:57.333 --> 30:58.500
(ENGINE STARTING)

31:03.800 --> 31:06.600
Life is one big
learning lesson.

31:06.633 --> 31:08.000
I like the feeling that

31:08.033 --> 31:11.467
I am strong and I can
take care of it.

31:11.500 --> 31:13.167
And that probably leads into

31:13.200 --> 31:15.033
why I don't make
a good partner for anybody

31:15.067 --> 31:17.400
is, I can take care of it,

31:17.433 --> 31:20.767
and I don't have any desire
to share a lot of the load.

31:20.800 --> 31:24.633
That's the biggest thing
being out here has done,

31:24.667 --> 31:26.867
or this entire lifestyle
throughout my life,

31:26.900 --> 31:29.900
is really well defined

31:29.933 --> 31:32.033
parameters of need and want.

31:32.067 --> 31:34.500
What can I do for myself?

31:34.533 --> 31:37.200
If I can't do it this way,
the way everybody else
does it,

31:37.233 --> 31:39.467
well, how can
I do it in a way
that works for me?

31:39.500 --> 31:40.800
You learn,

31:40.833 --> 31:43.533
you can be quite capable of
taking care of yourself.

31:59.300 --> 32:00.667
Ah!

32:08.900 --> 32:09.967
(GRUNTS LOUDLY)

32:14.267 --> 32:18.000
The amount of physical labour
it takes to be here,

32:18.033 --> 32:19.300
do this on my own...

32:19.333 --> 32:21.267
Oh, come on, bitch.

32:21.300 --> 32:22.833
There's nobody to help you.

32:22.867 --> 32:26.200
You've got to pick it up,
and then you've got to
move it.

32:26.233 --> 32:29.633
And to depend on
everybody else to
get me there

32:29.667 --> 32:31.067
is currently unacceptable.

32:34.733 --> 32:36.533
I don't know,

32:36.567 --> 32:38.300
that's 300, 400 pounds
of fun there.

32:40.067 --> 32:43.200
Unleaded. Highly explosive.

32:43.233 --> 32:45.633
That's not a good feeling.

32:45.667 --> 32:47.033
But the ratchet strap

32:47.067 --> 32:50.733
that was holding them
together, did not hold.

32:50.767 --> 32:54.367
So you stop what you're
doing, ride it...

32:54.400 --> 32:56.500
I'll go around, check it,
make sure there's no leaks.

32:56.533 --> 32:59.400
I don't see any,
but I'll check it again.

33:00.433 --> 33:02.967
But I need it back here
out of the way.

33:03.000 --> 33:05.500
Every day's full of surprises.
That's one of them.

33:05.533 --> 33:08.233
You know, so be surprised,
but get your ass off your,

33:08.267 --> 33:11.267
you know,
couch and deal with it.

33:11.300 --> 33:13.800
This really was
the last bit of preparation

33:13.833 --> 33:15.033
for my equipment.

33:15.067 --> 33:17.667
Yeah, I mean, your world is
getting tight now.

33:17.700 --> 33:19.000
The winter is gonna be here.

33:19.033 --> 33:21.267
It's here, it's going to keep
getting worse.

33:21.300 --> 33:23.100
Everything else
I do from here on out

33:23.133 --> 33:24.967
it's going to be under
my own power,

33:25.000 --> 33:26.600
my own steam,
my own energy.

33:26.633 --> 33:28.667
The last of the
heavy, heavy items

33:28.700 --> 33:31.067
that needed to be lifted
were forklifted.

33:31.100 --> 33:33.867
The bucket is on it.
It did its number.

33:33.900 --> 33:36.567
Backed in and put to bed,
it's waiting for spring.

33:36.600 --> 33:38.200
Those doors are shut
for the equipment

33:38.233 --> 33:40.000
from here on out
for that Bobcat.

33:40.033 --> 33:41.600
The rest of the season...

33:41.633 --> 33:44.133
It's, uh, girl power.

33:47.333 --> 33:49.100
CHIP: People who do
subsistence like we do

33:49.133 --> 33:50.467
are self-employed.

33:50.500 --> 33:52.400
We don't have
to work for someone else.

33:52.433 --> 33:53.800
That's a bunch of garbage.

33:53.833 --> 33:55.867
We're a bunch of
"Work for ourselves
kind of people".

33:57.167 --> 33:58.667
We're much happier this way.

34:07.567 --> 34:10.567
CHIP: I think this is a little
shallower than we want.

34:10.600 --> 34:11.867
I'm just gonna
turn around here.

34:18.400 --> 34:21.500
Ooh! There's no calf,
there's no calf.

34:21.533 --> 34:23.333
Right there,
right there, right there,
right there.

34:23.367 --> 34:25.267
It's alone. Ain't got no calf.

34:25.300 --> 34:26.400
Shoot it.

34:35.300 --> 34:37.433
AGNES: Yee-haw! Whoo!

34:40.767 --> 34:42.067
Chip.

34:48.567 --> 34:49.967
CHIP: (WHISPERS)
He's right up here.

34:53.000 --> 34:55.500
-(GUNSHOT)
-Ooh! He's down,
he's down, he's down!

34:55.533 --> 34:56.600
Reload. Reload.

34:56.633 --> 34:57.933
Put one in the chamber
in case he's alive.

35:00.400 --> 35:01.600
Just finish him off.

35:04.567 --> 35:06.567
-(GUNSHOT)
-Yeah, he's done.

35:06.600 --> 35:09.700
My last shot. Empty.

35:11.933 --> 35:14.567
Oh, my God,
this is a perfect one.

35:14.600 --> 35:17.067
It's going to be feeding
a lot of people,

35:17.100 --> 35:19.367
me and my whole
family anyways.

35:20.500 --> 35:22.867
Oh, man, this is a good one.

35:22.900 --> 35:26.133
We're having moose steaks
for dinner.

35:26.167 --> 35:27.667
ERIK: A lot of different
people come to Alaska

35:27.700 --> 35:29.367
for a lot of
different reasons.

35:29.400 --> 35:31.067
I came here to sort of find

35:31.100 --> 35:33.900
my place in the world,
which I... Which I did.

35:33.933 --> 35:35.800
But it's not for everybody.

35:50.433 --> 35:51.433
(ENGINE REVS)

35:56.867 --> 35:59.300
ERIK: Trapping is
a real challenge,

35:59.333 --> 36:01.467
because when you're trapping
an animal like an Arctic fox,

36:01.500 --> 36:04.300
where they live is a very
inhospitable climate.

36:05.667 --> 36:08.100
It's really cold
up in Arctic fox country.

36:08.133 --> 36:09.433
What you're really
fighting against

36:09.467 --> 36:11.467
more than anything then
is the weather conditions,

36:12.067 --> 36:14.367
and the terrain.

36:14.400 --> 36:16.067
So trapping's
a real challenge.

36:16.100 --> 36:18.633
There's very little
harder to do out in the bush

36:18.667 --> 36:21.600
than to run a trap line and
catch animals consistently.

36:26.433 --> 36:28.100
The fox population is a cycle

36:28.133 --> 36:30.267
like anything else here
in the Arctic.

36:30.300 --> 36:32.833
It comes up
and it goes down and...

36:32.867 --> 36:35.033
They get rabies
and it kills them off.

36:35.067 --> 36:37.067
And they crash
and then they come back,

36:37.100 --> 36:39.200
and they go up and down,
up and down, and...

36:39.233 --> 36:40.967
That's just the...

36:41.000 --> 36:43.767
The cyclical nature
of nature.

36:48.600 --> 36:50.033
Checking this trap.

36:51.400 --> 36:52.700
Nothing.

36:57.133 --> 36:59.633
Trap's been here a few days.
Nothing yet.

36:59.667 --> 37:01.000
But being here in the light,

37:01.033 --> 37:03.300
it's a nice spot here
on the riverbank and...

37:03.333 --> 37:05.967
I'm pretty confident this trap
will produce in time.

37:06.000 --> 37:07.633
I'm gonna go
and check a couple more.

37:09.767 --> 37:11.333
I guide hunters all fall,

37:11.367 --> 37:13.733
and after taking other people
around in the wilderness

37:13.767 --> 37:15.533
for many months in a row,

37:15.567 --> 37:17.700
trapping is a nice reprieve
to just spend

37:17.733 --> 37:20.933
some time alone
out in the woods
and do my own thing.

37:20.967 --> 37:23.367
Got a couple traps checked,
haven't caught anything yet,

37:23.400 --> 37:25.800
but, few more to go and...

37:25.833 --> 37:27.900
Hopefully I'll get lucky
towards the end of the line.

37:32.933 --> 37:34.533
I've been
a little bit disappointed here

37:34.567 --> 37:36.933
that there's been
a rabies epidemic.

37:36.967 --> 37:38.800
And the numbers of foxes
that I'm seeing

37:38.833 --> 37:40.667
are much lower than
the past few years.

37:40.700 --> 37:42.167
So hopefully
as the winter progresses,

37:42.200 --> 37:44.600
I'll see some more,
but thus far this season

37:44.633 --> 37:47.467
I haven't seen as much
fox sign as I normally do.

37:49.667 --> 37:53.067
Checking traps all day.
I haven't had much luck.

37:53.100 --> 37:55.833
I see a fox track here
approaching my cubby.

37:55.867 --> 37:57.733
I got high hopes here
on the last one.

38:00.533 --> 38:01.700
Nice!

38:07.100 --> 38:09.233
I got an Arctic fox.

38:09.267 --> 38:11.733
Finally got a payoff here
on these new
cubby boxes I made.

38:12.567 --> 38:13.767
Really nice hide.

38:13.800 --> 38:15.667
Nice clean catch,
got him right on the neck.

38:15.700 --> 38:18.700
I'm sure I killed him
instantly here with
this 330 conibear,

38:18.733 --> 38:21.167
and this makes it
all worth it.

38:21.200 --> 38:23.867
I'm pumped. That's awesome.
Got a white fox.

38:25.100 --> 38:27.700
I'm definitely leaving this
cubby box here

38:27.733 --> 38:30.200
and next time I come through
I'll bring the trap back
and reset it.

38:30.233 --> 38:32.333
It's a good spot.

38:32.367 --> 38:34.733
When I was growing up
I really enjoyed hunting,

38:34.767 --> 38:38.100
and that's why
when I came of age
I became a guide.

38:38.133 --> 38:40.533
And now that
I've entirely ruined
hunting for myself

38:40.567 --> 38:44.000
by being a guide,
and I miss pretty much
the entire season,

38:44.033 --> 38:46.567
my big thing in the last
few years is trapping.

38:46.600 --> 38:48.433
Where I live in
the Brooks Range of Alaska,

38:48.467 --> 38:51.633
I'm in the most southern
of the Arctic fox's range.

38:51.667 --> 38:55.100
So, I don't get very many.
So, it's kind of
a special catch.

38:55.133 --> 38:58.267
I'm gonna get this fox home,
and skin it out and...

38:58.300 --> 39:01.200
A fox like this
is worth up to about $250.

39:01.233 --> 39:03.900
So, that's a good catch
for me.

39:03.933 --> 39:06.567
CHIP: The whole idea
of us hunting is economic.

39:06.600 --> 39:07.833
It's what we do
to make a living.

39:07.867 --> 39:09.133
A lot of people criticise us,

39:09.167 --> 39:11.033
but yet those people don't
put their hands on an animal

39:11.067 --> 39:12.133
and kill it themselves.

39:12.167 --> 39:13.733
Somebody else
does it for them.

39:29.433 --> 39:31.233
CHIP: Hello, Mr Moose.

39:31.267 --> 39:33.167
Yeah, you can use
every part of this.

39:33.200 --> 39:35.233
What I can't use,
I can give away.

39:35.267 --> 39:36.533
I personally don't need
the antlers

39:36.567 --> 39:38.133
but I know somebody
who will value

39:38.167 --> 39:39.400
the material of the antlers.

39:39.433 --> 39:40.900
They don't care
if they're intact or anything,

39:40.933 --> 39:43.400
but I'll saw them up
and send them to 'em.

39:45.933 --> 39:48.633
Trying to use
all of an animal's products,

39:48.667 --> 39:49.967
is giving it respect.

39:50.000 --> 39:52.333
You know, and trying
to kill it as painlessly

39:52.367 --> 39:54.967
and as fast as possible
is giving it respect.

39:57.467 --> 40:00.733
This is a delicious
moose tongue.
I'm gonna boil this in water.

40:00.767 --> 40:03.033
I'm gonna take it out
and slice it up.

40:03.067 --> 40:05.900
Put salt and pepper on it,
and I'm gonna eat
the whole thing myself,

40:05.933 --> 40:07.900
if I can do it
without them catching me.

40:07.933 --> 40:09.033
Is that heart and tongue?

40:09.067 --> 40:10.433
CHIP: It's just tongue
so far, babe.

40:10.467 --> 40:11.500
The heart's in here somewhere.

40:11.533 --> 40:13.033
You should make
heart and tongue soup.

40:13.067 --> 40:14.667
The heart's in this bag.

40:14.700 --> 40:15.967
You want me to make heart
and tongue soup?

40:17.700 --> 40:20.733
There's a heart. Delicious.

40:20.767 --> 40:21.800
See, my daughter wants
heart and tongue.

40:21.833 --> 40:23.500
So, I'm really working
for them.

40:36.467 --> 40:38.467
(AGNES SPEAKING)

40:38.500 --> 40:41.133
CHIP: Yeah...
That's a nice chunk of it.

40:49.533 --> 40:50.533
CHIP: Yeah.

40:57.867 --> 40:58.867
-CHIP: Sure.
-(PHONE BEEPS)

41:02.867 --> 41:04.233
-Hey, Jeff?
-(JEFF SPEAKING)

41:04.267 --> 41:06.233
Hey, I got a tenderloin
here for you.

41:08.000 --> 41:09.000
Yeah. Stop by.

41:09.800 --> 41:10.933
Bye.

41:10.967 --> 41:12.600
I'm always happy
when I kill something.

41:12.633 --> 41:14.200
It's success. It's what we do.

41:14.233 --> 41:16.333
We don't get
a moose every fall.
We used to get musk ox.

41:16.367 --> 41:18.367
We prefer them to moose.

41:18.400 --> 41:20.067
But it's a good substitute.
What can you say?

41:22.233 --> 41:24.067
NARRATOR: For the
Hailstone family,

41:24.100 --> 41:25.933
spare meat goes a long way

41:25.967 --> 41:28.633
in a community
that relies on trade.

41:28.667 --> 41:30.167
Today they will share
their harvest

41:30.200 --> 41:32.567
with their neighbour
and long-time friend, Jeff.

41:33.467 --> 41:35.467
-CHIP: Come on in.
-Hey, Chip.

41:35.500 --> 41:37.600
-CHIP: What's going on?
-I see you guys got a moose
out there.

41:37.633 --> 41:38.700
We got a moose out there.

41:38.733 --> 41:40.033
We're gonna hang
the bigger chunks up,

41:40.067 --> 41:41.100
and we'll split it up later,

41:41.133 --> 41:42.600
but for now
there's tenderloins.

41:42.633 --> 41:44.733
JEFF: Awesome.
CHIP: You guys can
chow down for a day or two

41:44.767 --> 41:46.967
or give it all away
if you don't want it.

41:47.000 --> 41:48.833
JEFF: No, that'll go
straight to the freezer.

41:48.867 --> 41:51.767
CHIP: Yep.
There's a shorter piece of
sinew for you.

41:51.800 --> 41:53.600
JEFF: All of this?
CHIP: Yep.

41:53.633 --> 41:54.800
AGNES: Yep, we'll always
give you some.

41:54.833 --> 41:56.433
CHIP: She just cleaned up
that tenderloin here.

41:56.467 --> 41:58.133
A lot of this is fat
you can just chop up.

41:58.167 --> 42:00.467
There's some hairs,
and there's some grass

42:00.500 --> 42:02.000
that needs to be
gathered off of it yet.

42:02.033 --> 42:04.500
But, what the heck?
They eat grass, right?

42:04.533 --> 42:08.900
-Yeah.
-And twigs and willows and...

42:08.933 --> 42:11.367
This one was almost invisible
in the willows, though.

42:11.400 --> 42:13.733
Got an excellent
colour on him. No rut.

42:13.767 --> 42:14.967
JEFF: Thanks a lot
for the meat.

42:15.000 --> 42:16.100
-I appreciate it.
-Yeah, no problem.

42:16.133 --> 42:17.167
What are you gonna do
with the tongue?

42:17.200 --> 42:19.733
Eat it myself. All myself.

42:21.167 --> 42:22.467
JEFF: I'll make sure
I stop by.

42:22.500 --> 42:25.300
There you go. Yeah.
I'll make potatoes with it.

42:25.333 --> 42:26.967
Well, I gotta run.
Thanks for the moose again.

42:27.000 --> 42:28.733
-That was awesome.
-CHIP: Yep.

42:28.767 --> 42:30.900
And I will see you later.

42:30.933 --> 42:32.567
CHIP: We all reciprocate
in one way or another.

42:32.600 --> 42:36.500
Gasoline, meat,
parts, babysitting, bullets.

42:36.533 --> 42:37.967
We've chosen to be happy,

42:38.000 --> 42:40.733
not rich, not full of money.

42:40.767 --> 42:42.900
We're not in competition
with other people.

42:42.933 --> 42:46.167
We like being providers,
and sharing, and contributing.
