call me Lizzie.

10:18.052 --> 10:20.054
Nice to meet you.DYLAN: Let's find
somewhere to sit.

10:20.097 --> 10:21.751
You must be exhausted.

10:21.795 --> 10:23.013
CANDACE:
Since we were little,

10:23.057 --> 10:24.624
Dad told Cormac,
one day,

10:24.667 --> 10:26.756
he'd take over the
family business.

10:26.800 --> 10:29.019
But that was the last
thing that Mac wanted.

10:29.063 --> 10:31.892
He talked about
moving to New York

10:31.935 --> 10:34.155
or sailing around
the world. [chuckles]

10:34.198 --> 10:35.983
And how about when
your father announced

10:36.026 --> 10:37.724
that he was shutting
down the factory

10:37.767 --> 10:39.116
and moving the business
to Mexico City?

10:39.160 --> 10:40.683
That's when he told Mac
he'd be going down there

10:40.727 --> 10:42.119
to get things up and running.

10:42.163 --> 10:44.556
Did Cormac tell your father
he didn't want to go?

10:44.600 --> 10:46.428
Of course not.

10:46.471 --> 10:50.693
Our father was
charming and admired,

10:50.737 --> 10:55.176
but behind closed
doors, he was...

10:55.219 --> 10:56.786
an angry man.

10:56.830 --> 10:57.787
Abusive?

10:57.831 --> 11:00.355
He was hard on my brother.

11:04.315 --> 11:06.622
Is this familiar?

11:06.666 --> 11:09.190
Cormac had that
when we were little.

11:09.233 --> 11:11.192
Where'd you find it?

11:11.235 --> 11:13.368
He's been using similar ones
to cover his victims.

11:13.411 --> 11:15.805
DYLAN: We think this blanket
may represent comfort to him,

11:15.849 --> 11:20.157
the way he comforted his victims
after their pain.

11:20.201 --> 11:24.118
It connects Cormac
to some remaining shred of love

11:24.161 --> 11:26.381
he once had, most likely
for someone special.

11:26.424 --> 11:29.732
Um...

11:29.776 --> 11:34.345
There was one night,
dead of winter,

11:34.389 --> 11:37.784
and Cormac wet the bed.

11:37.827 --> 11:40.438
Dad stormed upstairs
and ripped the sheets off,

11:40.482 --> 11:43.659
and grabbed Mac and threw him
out of the house.

11:43.703 --> 11:46.575
"Till you grow the hell up,
you sleep outside.

11:46.618 --> 11:48.272
You man up."

11:48.316 --> 11:51.449
So, I snuck outside
with this blanket,

11:51.493 --> 11:54.191
but I couldn't find him.

11:54.235 --> 11:59.501
So I went to the dock,
and there he was, in our boat.

11:59.544 --> 12:01.677
We'd hide there
when Dad lost his temper.

12:01.721 --> 12:05.246
He was shivering, scared.

12:05.289 --> 12:06.813
So I put this
blanket over him,

12:06.856 --> 12:09.119
and I told him it
would be all right.

12:09.163 --> 12:10.904
Did you reach out
to your brother today?

12:10.947 --> 12:14.124
No. Dylan asked me not to.

12:14.168 --> 12:17.127
Likely would have gone
straight to voice mail, anyways.

12:17.171 --> 12:18.563
We've tried a few
times already.

12:18.607 --> 12:21.436
We think now is the time
for you to call Cormac,

12:21.479 --> 12:24.439
and if he doesn't answer,
to leave a message

12:24.482 --> 12:26.354
so he can hear your voice.

12:26.397 --> 12:27.703
Why?

12:27.747 --> 12:29.400
To connect with him.

12:29.444 --> 12:31.141
But what if he
wants to see me?

12:31.185 --> 12:33.665
Then we'll arrange a safe place
for you to meet.

12:33.709 --> 12:35.276
You want me to
help you trap him?

12:35.319 --> 12:36.843
Find him.

12:36.886 --> 12:38.714
In an environment
we can control

12:38.758 --> 12:40.281
so that we can make sure

12:40.324 --> 12:41.804
everyone is safe,
including Cormac.

12:41.848 --> 12:44.198
We'll be there, undercover.

12:44.241 --> 12:48.463
He trusts you more than...
more than anyone.

12:48.506 --> 12:51.161

a real piece of work.

13:35.553 --> 13:37.860
And we could use his help.

It's not like him.

in a department store.

13:53.876 --> 13:55.356
When did he leave?
Don't know.

13:55.399 --> 13:56.618

13:56.661 --> 13:58.576
Where are we with the sister?

14:00.578 --> 14:02.885
Cormac wants to meet.
He just texted.

14:02.929 --> 14:04.887
Candace? Where?

14:04.931 --> 14:09.022
Your favorite place?
Do you know where that is?

14:09.065 --> 14:11.894
Cormac and I came here a couple
times when we were little.

14:11.938 --> 14:13.722
There was this
neighborhood we loved.

14:13.765 --> 14:16.725
It had cobblestone streets,

14:16.768 --> 14:19.249
old buildings, piers.

14:19.293 --> 14:20.642
South Street Seaport.

14:20.685 --> 14:23.036
CANDACE: There were these
giant sailboats,

14:23.079 --> 14:25.908
and we would just sit there, and
we would pretend one was ours,

14:25.952 --> 14:27.736
and we'd talk about
where we'd sail to.

14:27.779 --> 14:30.521
This is a good thing, right?

14:30.565 --> 14:32.349
It's what you wanted?

14:32.393 --> 14:33.655
It's a very good thing.

14:33.698 --> 14:34.917
It's a terrible thing.

14:34.961 --> 14:36.832
A public place,
of which we have no control.

14:36.876 --> 14:38.442
If Cormac is in a manic state,

14:38.486 --> 14:40.183
there is a high
risk of violence.

14:40.227 --> 14:42.838
So, what are you saying-- we
don't take him up on his offer?Yes.

14:42.882 --> 14:44.405
We find a reason she can't go,

14:44.448 --> 14:45.797
then we have Candace
call him back,

14:45.841 --> 14:47.930
offering a location that
we choose and we control.

14:47.974 --> 14:49.497
JASMINE:
A guy who kills
three people

14:49.540 --> 14:51.847

whatever, dude" type of guy.

14:51.891 --> 14:53.501
And what if he gets suspicious?

14:53.544 --> 14:55.459
Still preferable.I know you love to think,

14:55.503 --> 14:56.896

this time.

14:56.939 --> 14:59.420
We know where he'll be.
We see him and we grab him.

14:59.463 --> 15:01.639
Or the plan doesn't work, and he
sees Candace can't be trusted.

15:01.683 --> 15:04.294
Which means we lose her
as a card to play,

15:04.338 --> 15:06.296

22:35.571 --> 22:38.139
Well, technically,
you made two mistakes.

22:38.182 --> 22:40.228
You lost Rego in Garfield,
then you totally

22:40.271 --> 22:42.883
messed up today.This is a horrible pep talk.

22:44.232 --> 22:46.930
It was your instincts
that took us to Garfield.

22:46.974 --> 22:50.804
And if we hadn't gone there,
we might never have been able

22:50.847 --> 22:52.283
to I.D. Rego
as the killer.

22:52.327 --> 22:54.808
Now he's on the run, injured,
again, because of you.

22:54.851 --> 22:57.245
The only wall out there
is around Cormac Rego,

22:57.288 --> 22:58.899
and it is closing in.

22:58.942 --> 23:01.510
So stop feeling like
you've let everybody down,

23:01.554 --> 23:04.078
and show me some
of that Midwestern,

23:04.121 --> 23:06.907
steak-eating,
cornfield-loving,

23:06.950 --> 23:09.388
"Oh, What a Beautiful Morning"
optimism, okay?

23:10.824 --> 23:12.434
Okay.
Mm-hmm.

23:12.478 --> 23:13.783
Okay. Thank you.

23:13.827 --> 23:15.219
And, you know,

23:15.263 --> 23:16.960
Nebraska isn't...

23:17.004 --> 23:18.266
Oklahoma.Yes.

23:18.309 --> 23:19.572
FUCCI: Yeah, so we're
pulling footage

23:19.615 --> 23:21.443
from within a one-mile
radius of the Seaport,

23:21.487 --> 23:22.966
so fingers crossed
and all that.

23:23.010 --> 23:25.012
We have to be careful.

23:25.055 --> 23:27.406
Cormac is a wounded animal,
possibly prone

23:27.449 --> 23:29.320
to impulsive aggression,
which can occur with

23:29.364 --> 23:31.366
or without provocation.FUCCI: Yeah, well,

23:31.410 --> 23:34.238
when I get eyes on Rego,
I won't lack for provocation.

23:34.282 --> 23:36.110
Provocation.

23:36.153 --> 23:37.851
Yeah, what? I use it wrong?

23:37.894 --> 23:39.505
Even if we had Candace
reach out to Rego again,

23:39.548 --> 23:40.854
he's not gonna trust us.

23:40.897 --> 23:43.291
We have to provoke
a response.

23:43.334 --> 23:46.381
What's the one sure way we could
connect with him in the past?

23:46.425 --> 23:48.383
Hmm?The suspense is killing me.

23:48.427 --> 23:50.037
Dennis Walker.Dennis Walker.

23:50.080 --> 23:51.517
FUCCI:
The weaselly podcaster?

23:51.560 --> 23:53.954
Well, it's not like he has
a direct line on the guy.

23:53.997 --> 23:55.564
He does, in a manner
of speaking.

23:55.608 --> 23:57.479

23:57.523 --> 23:59.481
I'm already on it.

23:59.525 --> 24:02.528
DYLAN: The podcast will
have a veil of anonymity.

24:02.571 --> 24:05.313
No one will mention Cormac's
name or yours, so it'll just be

24:05.356 --> 24:09.099
you talking to Cormac.And my 50,000 listeners.

24:11.667 --> 24:14.540
Yeah, I'll shut up. Yeah.

24:15.671 --> 24:18.326
We've been over
the verbal triggers

24:18.369 --> 24:20.371
and emotional buttons
to push

24:20.415 --> 24:22.330
that can help us
get Cormac in safely.

24:22.373 --> 24:24.375
But if you get into
any trouble...

24:24.419 --> 24:26.334
She won't.DYLAN: The primary goal

24:26.377 --> 24:28.336
is for Cormac to feel
the emotional toll

24:28.379 --> 24:30.338
this is taking on you
and your mom,

24:30.381 --> 24:32.340
and how much harder
it will be

24:32.383 --> 24:36.126
if you wind up
losing him, too.

24:36.170 --> 24:38.172
Maybe he'll turn
himself in

24:38.215 --> 24:42.132
or, at the very least,
he'll reach out to us.

24:42.176 --> 24:45.353
No, I don't know
if I can, uh...

24:45.396 --> 24:49.531
Just tell him the truth
and speak from the heart.

24:49.575 --> 24:51.490

a woman who believes
that she may be the sister

25:06.200 --> 25:08.158
of the Sleeping
Beauty killer.

25:08.202 --> 25:10.552
She's here to make
a public appeal to him.

25:10.596 --> 25:14.425

25:14.469 --> 25:19.169

Yeah. Sounded

26:22.450 --> 26:26.106

RYAN: How is it still personal
to Cormac if Mr. Rego is dead?

26:49.216 --> 26:52.436
I think Cormac blames you for
not being able to start over.

26:52.480 --> 26:54.438
I was just being a cop.

26:54.482 --> 26:56.310
You probably remind him
of what he couldn't be,

26:56.353 --> 26:59.008
the perfect son
for his monstrous father.

26:59.052 --> 27:00.575
[chuckles]
That's comforting.

27:00.619 --> 27:02.316
So now he wants
to kill me?

27:02.359 --> 27:04.535
It's entirely possible.

I've got a good story
to tell, too.

27:26.253 --> 27:27.558
We're releasing
Rego's name and photo.

27:27.602 --> 27:29.691
We're going wide.We got Candace to cooperate

27:29.735 --> 27:31.650
by promising that
we would not I.D. him.

27:31.693 --> 27:34.174
We? I didn't promise anything.

27:34.217 --> 27:36.350
He tried to kill that cabdriver.

27:36.393 --> 27:38.178
If he is attacking
people he perceives

27:38.221 --> 27:40.049
as threats, what's he
gonna do when he feels

27:40.093 --> 27:41.485
there are threats

Let's put them to work.

27:44.663 --> 27:46.186
He may change his M.O. again

27:46.229 --> 27:48.188
if he feels there's
nothing to lose.

27:48.231 --> 27:50.581
Keeping his identification
secret has gotten us nowhere.

27:50.625 --> 27:52.453

If we move in on him,

33:58.253 --> 33:59.428
Rego may do
something drastic.

34:01.126 --> 34:02.823
How about we take
this step-by-step?

34:02.866 --> 34:04.955
Step-by-step?
Step one,

34:04.999 --> 34:06.087
let him go.

34:06.131 --> 34:07.480
Oh, you mean the only
leverage I have?

34:07.523 --> 34:08.611
Right.
Mac.

34:08.655 --> 34:10.483
This is between you and me.

34:10.526 --> 34:12.180
We don't need him.

34:12.224 --> 34:13.964
You just tell me.

34:14.008 --> 34:16.228
Okay? Tell me what I can do.

34:16.271 --> 34:18.186
Step one,
drop your gun.

34:18.230 --> 34:20.014
Don't you dare.

34:20.058 --> 34:22.190
He's trying to establish trust.

34:22.234 --> 34:24.410
He's going to get
himself killed.

34:32.505 --> 34:34.898
Now it's your turn.

34:41.514 --> 34:43.516
CORMAC:
Now what?

34:43.559 --> 34:47.302
Now we talk. Okay? Just us.

34:47.346 --> 34:48.956
You can't stop
lying to me.

34:48.999 --> 34:50.827
You think I don't know
that you have backup here?

34:50.871 --> 34:51.785
I'm not an idiot!

34:51.828 --> 34:53.265
Nobody is calling you an idiot.

34:53.308 --> 34:55.093
Okay, I cheated off you in bio.

34:55.136 --> 34:56.224
Remember?

34:56.268 --> 34:57.965
Anyone else comes out here,

34:58.008 --> 35:00.794
I'm killing Ryan Stock,

35:00.837 --> 35:03.275
the golden boy of Garfield.

35:03.318 --> 35:06.278
You're right.
We got eyes on you.

35:07.931 --> 35:09.803
You shoot me, they shoot you.

35:09.846 --> 35:12.849
You try and run,
they shoot you.

35:12.893 --> 35:14.764
But if you don't do
either of those things,

35:14.808 --> 35:16.114
then we have options.

35:18.072 --> 35:19.813
And I want to help.

35:20.857 --> 35:21.945
How?

35:21.989 --> 35:25.297
Establish rapport, connect.
Good.

35:25.340 --> 35:26.907
[door opens,
footsteps approaching]

35:26.950 --> 35:28.735
Sarge, we need more time.

35:28.778 --> 35:31.041
Not your call.Ryan's engaged with him.

35:31.085 --> 35:34.088
If Rego sees you move on him,
he will panic.

35:34.132 --> 35:35.350
RYAN:
Whatever went down with

35:35.394 --> 35:37.178
you and your dad,
I'm on your side, okay?

35:37.222 --> 35:41.226
Don't talk about him.
I don't want to talk about him.

35:41.269 --> 35:43.053
Then let's talk about your mom.

35:44.925 --> 35:46.796
Or Candace.

35:46.840 --> 35:48.494
She loves you.

35:48.537 --> 35:50.452
She always did.

35:51.888 --> 35:54.282
Like that time your dad
threw you out of the house.

35:55.936 --> 35:58.068
You were scared, and
she found you, right?

35:58.112 --> 36:00.114
You were shivering in the boat.

36:02.247 --> 36:05.337
Candace brought
you that blanket.

36:05.380 --> 36:08.166
She will always
be here for you.

36:09.384 --> 36:11.517
Mac, you know that.

36:11.560 --> 36:12.996
Even now.

36:13.040 --> 36:15.869
She won't, though.

36:15.912 --> 36:17.392
Because you...

36:20.047 --> 36:22.005
...turned her against me.

36:23.050 --> 36:24.356
[sniffles]

36:24.399 --> 36:26.923
You destroyed our bond!

36:26.967 --> 36:29.056
Stop crying, Cormac.

36:29.926 --> 36:31.406
What did you say?

36:31.450 --> 36:32.973
You heard me.

36:33.016 --> 36:34.192
Man up!

36:34.235 --> 36:36.063
You sorry son of a...

36:39.806 --> 36:41.982
[grunting and groaning]

36:42.025 --> 36:43.244
[groans]

36:43.288 --> 36:45.855
[panting]

36:46.421 --> 36:48.467
[grunts]

36:50.338 --> 36:52.906
[grunting]

36:52.949 --> 36:54.255
I got him, I got him.

36:54.299 --> 36:56.170
Give me a hand.

36:56.214 --> 36:57.563
[grunting, coughing]

36:57.606 --> 37:00.392
You're under arrest,
you son of a bitch.

37:00.435 --> 37:02.437
[whimpering]

37:04.961 --> 37:06.963
[indistinct radio chatter]

37:19.149 --> 37:21.151
[car doors closing]

37:45.959 --> 37:47.482
Time's up.

37:51.007 --> 37:52.574
The power of their
sibling bond

37:52.618 --> 37:54.272
is remarkable.

37:54.315 --> 37:55.577
Despite everything,

37:55.621 --> 37:58.493
nothing can break it.

38:21.342 --> 38:23.997
DYLAN:
I don't know how you do
it in the cornfields,

38:24.040 --> 38:25.215
but here in the city,

38:25.259 --> 38:27.348
we have a little thing
called "protocol."

38:27.392 --> 38:29.350
LIZZIE:
Here in the city,
we consider it

38:29.394 --> 38:32.353
a cardinal sin to ever
lose possession of this.

38:32.397 --> 38:33.963
[chuckles]

38:34.007 --> 38:35.965
Thanks.

38:36.009 --> 38:37.489
You did it.

38:37.532 --> 38:39.360
We did it.

38:39.404 --> 38:41.406
Mm, some of us didn't think
you could hack it here.

38:41.449 --> 38:42.624
Who?

38:42.668 --> 38:44.365
Me.
And me.

38:44.409 --> 38:47.063
No, actually
just her. [laughs]

38:49.152 --> 38:51.372
[clicks safety,
sets gun on table]

39:04.516 --> 39:06.344
I need to shower.

39:06.387 --> 39:07.475
Yeah, you do.

39:07.519 --> 39:09.172
I wasn't going
to say anything.

39:09.216 --> 39:11.087
Thanks.

39:11.131 --> 39:13.307
Well done, you two.

39:13.351 --> 39:15.178
You made me
proud today.

39:16.571 --> 39:18.617
I'm going home to bed.

39:20.096 --> 39:22.185
Don't let it
get to your head.
Hmm.

39:22.229 --> 39:23.404
Too late.

39:23.448 --> 39:25.232
You happy to have me back

39:25.275 --> 39:27.103
from my Nebraska
adventure?

39:27.147 --> 39:28.409
We'll see.

39:28.453 --> 39:30.498
I'm happy, too.

39:31.978 --> 39:33.936
Want to go?

39:33.980 --> 39:35.547
No, I have something
I need to do.

39:35.590 --> 39:36.722
Okay.

39:36.765 --> 39:38.985
See you tomorrow.

39:51.563 --> 39:54.957
Katie, hey.
It's me, your big sis.

39:55.001 --> 39:56.394
Can you talk?

40:12.453 --> 40:15.413
That is quite a day.
You want a drink?

40:15.456 --> 40:18.677
No. I just want to go to bed.

40:18.720 --> 40:20.635
Your dad's here.

40:23.551 --> 40:26.032
I'll just put a
straw in the bottle.

40:38.044 --> 40:40.176
Dad.
Dylan.

40:40.220 --> 40:41.526
Good to see you.

40:41.569 --> 40:43.658
You, too. Everything okay?

40:43.702 --> 40:45.486
I should be asking you that.

40:45.530 --> 40:47.445
Heard you've had quite the day.

40:47.488 --> 40:49.229
Yes.

40:49.272 --> 40:51.318
Thankfully, it's over.

40:56.192 --> 41:00.327
I know we're not about to win
any father-son awards, and...

41:00.370 --> 41:04.157
maybe you weren't the most
compassionate of fathers.

41:04.200 --> 41:08.509
And maybe I wasn't
the easiest child to parent.

41:08.553 --> 41:10.163
[chuckles]

41:10.206 --> 41:12.513
Being deputy director of the CIA

41:12.557 --> 41:15.473
is a walk in the park
by comparison.

41:15.516 --> 41:17.605
But I know you care about me.

41:19.564 --> 41:21.827
And... much as
you may have disagreed,

41:21.870 --> 41:25.700
you've let me live my life,
so...

41:25.744 --> 41:27.354
thank you.

41:27.397 --> 41:30.139
You're welcome.

41:31.184 --> 41:33.360
You know...

41:33.403 --> 41:35.536
I've learned a lot from you.

41:35.580 --> 41:37.625
Still learning.

41:38.670 --> 41:40.672
But that's not why you're here.

41:40.715 --> 41:42.456
No.

41:42.500 --> 41:44.240
Your precinct's
had computer issues

41:44.284 --> 41:45.546
the last couple of months.

41:45.590 --> 41:47.374
I'm aware of that, yes.

41:47.417 --> 41:48.593
Then you're
obviously aware

41:48.636 --> 41:50.551
that Julian's been
working undercover,

41:50.595 --> 41:53.380
presumably fighting
off this cyberattack.

41:53.423 --> 41:55.600
Not loving the use
of "presumably."

41:55.643 --> 41:58.472
Chatter has it
that Julian Cousins

41:58.516 --> 42:01.083
has been planting that malware.

42:01.127 --> 42:03.564
That he's being
paid handsomely

42:03.608 --> 42:06.524
to compromise the city's
first responder network.

42:06.567 --> 42:08.308
You don't believe that.

42:09.657 --> 42:12.530
I wouldn't be
here otherwise.

42:12.573 --> 42:15.620
Julian is many things,
but he is not a traitor.

42:16.925 --> 42:18.448
He's a liar by trade.

42:18.492 --> 42:20.581
We all are.

42:20.625 --> 42:22.104
Were.

42:22.888 --> 42:24.498
Right.

42:24.542 --> 42:27.109
Anyhow...

42:27.153 --> 42:28.546
I thought you
should know.

42:28.589 --> 42:31.505
No, I'll let myself out.
