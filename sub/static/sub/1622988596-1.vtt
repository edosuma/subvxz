WEBVTT

00:38.330 --> 00:41.291
You were a cowboy.

00:44.795 --> 00:48.549
You'd just won the rodeo.
But you were dissatisfied.

00:48.590 --> 00:51.510
I was some kind of wild forest man.

00:54.388 --> 00:57.808
I was totally naked,
except for a leather vest

00:57.850 --> 01:00.394
and a golden bowl on my scrotum.

01:01.895 --> 01:04.147
Then something really crazy happened.

01:04.815 --> 01:07.293
I finished my cigarette...

01:07.359 --> 01:09.903
threw down the butt...

01:10.737 --> 01:13.141
and the entire world burst into flames.

01:13.206 --> 01:14.742
- Next.
- Yeah.

01:14.776 --> 01:16.544
So two hamburgers please.

01:16.578 --> 01:18.546
No onion, no sauce, no pickle.

01:18.580 --> 01:20.213
I don't want to see any
vegetable on the burger.

01:20.247 --> 01:22.249
He's seriously about this,
all right.

01:22.282 --> 01:23.618
Bun, burger, nothing else.

01:23.651 --> 01:25.218
I don't want to
hear him complain.

01:25.252 --> 01:27.555
Okay, that's two plain
hamburgers.

01:27.589 --> 01:30.290
I am so sorry for being
so sensitive with the food

01:30.324 --> 01:33.193
I'm going to eat,
I just love lunch.

01:33.226 --> 01:35.563
That's okay, that's $2.36.

01:35.597 --> 01:38.733
Yeah me and my best friend,
we're together.

01:38.766 --> 01:41.603
Hey, good things come
to those who wait, huh?

01:41.636 --> 01:42.570
Excuse me?

01:42.604 --> 01:44.772
The line is very long.

01:44.806 --> 01:45.807
Forget it.

01:45.840 --> 01:48.308
I'm going to have one...

01:48.342 --> 01:49.544
Excuse me?

01:49.577 --> 01:51.846
Give me a second, all right.

01:51.879 --> 01:53.514
I'm going to have one twenty...

01:53.548 --> 01:55.282
- Twenty piece chicken...
- Stop.

01:55.315 --> 01:58.251
I have to say the words, okay.

01:58.285 --> 02:00.888
I'm going to have one
twenty piece chick...

02:00.922 --> 02:03.323
One twenty piece tick...

02:03.357 --> 02:04.592
- Fuck.
- Sir, I know what

02:04.626 --> 02:06.293
- you're trying to order.
- I understand, okay.

02:06.326 --> 02:07.729
But I don't want to
try to order it.

02:07.762 --> 02:09.564
I want to order it.

02:09.597 --> 02:12.634
I'm going to have one
twenty piece chick...

02:13.768 --> 02:15.670
One twenty piece... fuck!

02:15.703 --> 02:16.904
Mother fucker!

02:16.938 --> 02:18.372
Bill, calm down, take your time.

02:18.405 --> 02:20.407
Stop it! Okay? Fucking sit down,

02:20.440 --> 02:22.810
you child hamburger eating
mother fucker.

02:22.844 --> 02:26.814
Meat and bread
like a fucking baby.

02:26.848 --> 02:30.183
Okay, I'm going to have one
twenty piece chicken nug...

02:30.217 --> 02:33.588
One twenty piece
chick... mother fucker!

02:33.621 --> 02:34.856
- Sir.
- Mother fucker!

02:34.889 --> 02:36.758
Twenty piece chicken nuggets.

02:38.860 --> 02:41.796
Fuck, fucking cunt
mother fucker.

02:41.829 --> 02:45.633
Fuck this fucking place,
mother fucker.

02:45.667 --> 02:47.702
How about you fucking clean this
fucking mess.

02:47.735 --> 02:49.904
Mother fucker? Huh?

02:49.937 --> 02:52.372
Just take a look, mother fucker.

02:52.406 --> 02:55.543
- Sir!
- What time is it, huh?

02:55.576 --> 02:57.645
- Sir.
- What can I do with these hands?

02:57.679 --> 02:59.346
What can I do with these hands?

02:59.379 --> 03:00.982
Tell me!

03:51.666 --> 03:54.769
Okay.

03:54.802 --> 03:56.336
Okay.

03:56.369 --> 03:57.705
Is that from the police?

03:57.739 --> 03:59.439
It's a beauty.

03:59.473 --> 04:01.008
The people who wrote that
were being really rude

04:01.042 --> 04:02.610
so I don't know
if there's going to be

04:02.643 --> 04:04.879
as much accuracy as you'd like.

04:04.912 --> 04:06.480
All right, well...

04:06.514 --> 04:08.049
how would you describe
the incident?

04:08.082 --> 04:11.485
Just passionate,
heartfelt, overzealous

04:11.519 --> 04:13.020
maybe a touch, yeah.

04:13.054 --> 04:15.355
- Okay.
- What?

04:15.388 --> 04:16.624
- Frankly?
- Yeah, give it to me

04:16.657 --> 04:18.059
as frankly as can be,
Dr. Thrush.

04:18.092 --> 04:20.928
Frankly, it sounds like
you're crazy.

04:20.962 --> 04:22.764
You can't say that
to mental patients.

04:22.797 --> 04:24.932
Bill, it was crazy.
That was very crazy.

04:28.703 --> 04:31.606
Fuck! I know, I know,
I know, it's just...

04:31.639 --> 04:33.641
- Are we going crazy again?
- I don't know.

04:33.674 --> 04:36.077
Okay, when I signed you out
six months ago

04:36.110 --> 04:38.646
I thought you were ready,
that might've been a mistake.

04:38.679 --> 04:41.783
I look at you guys now
and the look in your eyes.

04:41.816 --> 04:43.350
I mean, we don't want
to be crazy.

04:43.383 --> 04:45.520
You understand right?
We don't want this.

04:45.553 --> 04:47.555
I want to walk down
the street very calm.

04:47.588 --> 04:49.356
I want to pet
all the happy dogs.

04:49.389 --> 04:51.358
I want to be sane,
I want to be happy.

04:51.391 --> 04:53.360
Have you tried socializing?

04:53.393 --> 04:54.929
- Well, we live together.
- I know you're friends but...

04:54.962 --> 04:56.998
Best friends, best friends.

04:57.031 --> 04:59.399
Okay, you're best friends.

04:59.432 --> 05:01.803
But I think it would be healthy

05:01.836 --> 05:03.370
to try to socialize some more

05:03.403 --> 05:05.039
outside of this
relationship here.

05:05.072 --> 05:08.075
To join a club
or I don't know, play softball.

05:08.109 --> 05:09.811
No, no, no,
that's a fucking game.

05:09.844 --> 05:11.512
I hate the game,
it's a waste of time.

05:11.546 --> 05:14.549
Okay, no games. What about jobs?

05:14.582 --> 05:15.683
You guys gotta work
at some point, right?

05:15.716 --> 05:17.417
Gotta make some money.

05:17.450 --> 05:19.452
Yeah, fuck a job
it's a nightmare.

05:19.486 --> 05:21.722
He's right, I mean,
we're on the edge, you know,

05:21.756 --> 05:23.124
and I don't think going
and working at Walmart

05:23.157 --> 05:24.759
stacking a bunch of tampons up

05:24.792 --> 05:26.093
is going to give us
a new lust for live.

05:26.127 --> 05:27.728
- Do you?
- I'm sorry guys,

05:27.762 --> 05:29.997
- I'm at a loss here.
- I guess, uh, we could

05:30.031 --> 05:31.532
just go to the opera, huh?

05:31.566 --> 05:33.901
Sit front row, sip white wine.

05:33.935 --> 05:36.037
You know what?
I made these plans weeks ago.

05:36.070 --> 05:37.972
I wasn't planning on
you guys barging in here.

05:38.005 --> 05:39.874
Didn't mean to burden you
with your higher calling.

05:39.907 --> 05:41.441
Make an appointment,
come back in here,

05:41.474 --> 05:43.511
we'll dig into it.

05:43.544 --> 05:45.713
I think the time to provide
help to us is right now

05:45.746 --> 05:47.882
and you didn't do it, so.

05:47.915 --> 05:49.784
All right, well good luck, boys.

05:49.817 --> 05:51.018
Yeah, good luck to you.

05:51.052 --> 05:54.387
I hope she sings great and
you're really delighted by it.

05:54.421 --> 05:55.823
Jesus Christ.

06:03.430 --> 06:05.132
Hey.

06:05.166 --> 06:07.168
Hm?

06:07.201 --> 06:09.036
I'm thinking.

06:09.070 --> 06:11.806
I think I know why
we're going crazy.

06:11.839 --> 06:16.443
We're not crazy we just can't
control ourselves sometimes.

06:16.476 --> 06:19.847
Yeah but...

06:19.881 --> 06:23.483
I think we're ignoring something
important in life, dude.

06:23.517 --> 06:25.753
What?

06:25.786 --> 06:26.821
I think we need women.

06:26.854 --> 06:30.625
I think we need girlfriends.

06:30.658 --> 06:33.027
Too trouble.

06:33.060 --> 06:35.796
Too trouble, too much work.

06:35.830 --> 06:39.499
We need women in our lives
in any way, dude.

06:39.533 --> 06:41.202
It would just be better.

06:41.235 --> 06:44.639
Think about it, if you have
a girlfriend, you know,

06:44.672 --> 06:48.009
tickle her toes.

06:48.042 --> 06:50.711
Go see cool movies.

06:50.745 --> 06:53.848
Eat big pizzas.

06:53.881 --> 06:55.549
Think about that.

06:55.583 --> 06:58.686
Just think about... Hey,
are you listening?

06:58.719 --> 07:00.821
- Mm.
- Just think about...

07:00.855 --> 07:02.823
just think about it, if you
could make love to them

07:02.857 --> 07:07.561
how much... how much pressure
that would relieve, you know.

07:07.595 --> 07:09.997
- Think about it.
- Mm.

07:10.031 --> 07:12.533
Don't you want a girlfriend?

07:12.566 --> 07:14.735
Don't you want
a girlfriend?

07:14.769 --> 07:17.004
Don't you want a girlfriend?

07:17.038 --> 07:19.640
Don't you want
a girlfriend?

07:19.674 --> 07:20.741
Don't you want a girlfriend?

07:22.276 --> 07:23.644
Don't you want a girlfriend?

07:41.529 --> 07:44.131
Yo, you know, it's not too late
to turn away.

07:44.165 --> 07:45.800
It's too late for me,
give me that.

07:45.833 --> 07:48.135
- It's very hot.
- Good, all the better.

07:48.169 --> 07:52.840
And more, here come more,
more women.

07:52.873 --> 07:54.275
Ugh.

07:54.308 --> 07:57.678
- Come on, let's go.
- Okay.

08:07.688 --> 08:08.923
Hello.

08:08.956 --> 08:10.925
I'm going to be
totally honest with you

08:10.958 --> 08:13.728
because you have
that kind of eyes.

08:13.761 --> 08:17.131
Um, I'm here looking... looking
to meet... to meet a woman

08:17.164 --> 08:19.800
at the mall so.

08:19.834 --> 08:21.268
You look like a nice person.

08:21.302 --> 08:22.570
Have a good personality.

08:22.603 --> 08:24.905
Oh, thank you, thanks.

08:24.939 --> 08:29.910
So what's... what's your naturally
skin care routine?

08:29.944 --> 08:32.546
What's your skin care routine?

08:32.580 --> 08:34.048
Um.

08:34.081 --> 08:37.618
- Is that a good fabric?
- Yeah, it's pretty good.

08:37.651 --> 08:39.787
I haven't been to this mall
since Santa Claus was here

08:39.820 --> 08:44.258
and trying to... trying to tell me
I should get a chunk of coal

08:44.291 --> 08:47.328
and I'm like, I think... I think
I deserve the castle.

08:47.361 --> 08:50.231
You know what I mean?
The play... the play castle.

08:50.264 --> 08:52.967
- Yeah.
- Did you come here with someone?

08:53.000 --> 08:55.136
- Yeah?
- Yeah, with my... my friend.

08:55.169 --> 08:58.239
Oh okay, they take care of you?

08:58.272 --> 09:00.775
- Like you have someone?
- We take care of each other.

09:00.808 --> 09:02.276
- Yeah? Okay.
- Yeah, we take care of

09:02.309 --> 09:04.011
each other, we're best friends.

09:04.045 --> 09:06.080
Do they know that you left?

09:06.113 --> 09:07.615
How about we cut to the chase?

09:07.648 --> 09:08.682
Do you have a boyfriend?

09:08.716 --> 09:09.950
That's a forward question.

09:09.984 --> 09:11.786
I'm just, you know what?

09:11.819 --> 09:14.789
I'm talking to as many people
as possible and uh...

09:19.026 --> 09:20.828
Ugh, fuck.

09:28.736 --> 09:30.204
Hey.

09:30.237 --> 09:32.673
Want to uh...

09:32.706 --> 09:33.874
Conversation?

09:33.908 --> 09:35.609
Oh my god,
that guy's your friend?

09:35.643 --> 09:37.945
- Yeah, I'm the other dude.
- Oh, are you... are you

09:37.978 --> 09:40.081
his like watcher
or something?

09:40.114 --> 09:41.916
Yeah, we watch each other yeah.

09:41.949 --> 09:45.853
Okay cause he's... he's like
being a little funny,

09:45.886 --> 09:47.788
- just so you know.
- What'd you say?

09:47.822 --> 09:49.256
He's just being a little bit...

09:49.290 --> 09:50.758
What do you mean funny?

09:50.791 --> 09:52.026
Like his behavior?

09:52.059 --> 09:53.227
It's a little bit inappropriate.

09:53.260 --> 09:56.030
Oh and you're perfect.

10:01.936 --> 10:06.674
Yeah.

10:06.707 --> 10:08.409
- Okay, these are normal girls.
- Uh-huh.

10:08.442 --> 10:10.044
And ask yourself this terrible
little question.

10:10.077 --> 10:11.879
- Are we normal men?
- No.

10:11.912 --> 10:13.380
And I know the whole time
we're here we're thinking,

10:13.414 --> 10:16.150
"Oh these girls.
That girl, this one."

10:16.183 --> 10:18.319
And I'm thinking another
thing at the same time.

10:18.352 --> 10:20.788
We need two women in
the same situation we're in.

10:20.821 --> 10:22.256
You mean two girls
who live in a basement?

10:22.289 --> 10:24.725
No dude, I mean two girls
that are crazy, okay.

10:24.758 --> 10:27.128
And not crazy cute like
these dolls think they are.

10:27.161 --> 10:30.131
I'm talking fucking fire
for blood nuts, all right.

10:30.164 --> 10:31.832
That's simply brilliant.

10:31.866 --> 10:33.300
I know and lightning strikes
twice

10:33.334 --> 10:35.035
- 'cause I got another plan.
- Uh-huh.

10:35.069 --> 10:36.670
Here's what we do.

10:36.704 --> 10:38.205
We go to Sterling Springs.

10:38.239 --> 10:40.174
We say we're from
the government.

10:40.207 --> 10:42.343
We pick up girls,
give them rides home.

10:42.376 --> 10:44.945
They don't have a good time,
fine, they got a free ride.

10:44.979 --> 10:47.715
If they do have a good time,
they like us.

10:47.748 --> 10:49.717
That's a girlfriend opportunity
for you and me.

10:49.750 --> 10:51.085
Okay?

10:51.118 --> 10:53.454
But how are we going to
get a car, Bill?

10:53.487 --> 10:56.056
Dude, how do we get cars?

10:56.090 --> 10:57.458
We get a car how we get a car.

10:57.491 --> 10:59.160
- Okay.
- All right.

11:24.084 --> 11:27.855
Coward! Car keys! Car keys!

11:27.888 --> 11:29.423
Run. Run!

11:39.867 --> 11:41.335
What'd you find?

11:55.382 --> 11:57.751
Sterling Springs.

11:57.785 --> 12:00.387
The nuthouse for women.

12:00.421 --> 12:02.022
- Hey.
- Hm?

12:02.056 --> 12:03.224
Gum, you want some?

12:03.257 --> 12:05.426
Mhm, thank you.

12:19.240 --> 12:21.141
So basically you give rides...

12:21.175 --> 12:24.478
Dude, just relax okay?

12:24.512 --> 12:28.315
Wow, I got it, I got it,
it's fine

12:32.286 --> 12:34.321
Hi miss, you need a ride?

12:38.459 --> 12:41.095
We're... we're actually
with the Washington government.

12:41.128 --> 12:44.898
They've commissioned us
to basically give rides

12:44.932 --> 12:47.067
to people who are mentally,
you know,

12:47.101 --> 12:50.437
having challenges
and quite upset, so.

12:52.006 --> 12:54.174
All right, buckle up.

12:54.208 --> 12:55.876
Please, where do we take you?

12:55.909 --> 12:59.079
- The store.
- Which store?

12:59.113 --> 13:02.082
Just... the next... the next store
you see

13:02.116 --> 13:03.450
just pull into it.

13:03.484 --> 13:05.587
Which one?

13:05.620 --> 13:07.488
Do you guys have any alcohol.

13:07.522 --> 13:08.822
Have some good gin.

13:08.856 --> 13:11.025
Fuck.

13:11.058 --> 13:13.227
There's a lot
of fucking cops out.

13:13.260 --> 13:16.497
Uh, just good for communities,
you know.

13:16.531 --> 13:20.334
Hey, what's your name?

13:20.367 --> 13:22.336
- Bonnie.
- Bonnie, I'm Andy.

13:22.369 --> 13:23.937
That's Bill,
my best friend Bill.

13:23.971 --> 13:27.041
Beautiful Bill actually.

13:27.074 --> 13:29.209
Fuck there's too much heat
on this street, dude.

13:29.243 --> 13:30.878
I'm not gonna lie to you
I'm freaking out.

13:30.911 --> 13:32.246
It's okay,.

13:32.279 --> 13:34.882
Fuck.

13:34.915 --> 13:36.417
This isn't working. This isn't
working. This isn't working.

13:36.450 --> 13:39.320
- What are you talking about?
- It's not working, dude.

13:39.353 --> 13:41.055
Dude, let me think.

13:41.088 --> 13:43.390
Why... why are we stopping?

13:43.424 --> 13:46.126
There's a cop trailing us, dude.

13:46.160 --> 13:48.028
Ma'am, I gotta be honest
with you.

13:48.062 --> 13:49.263
We're not a car service.

13:49.296 --> 13:51.365
I'm sorry, we just did a fib.

13:51.398 --> 13:53.133
For really positive reasons.

13:53.167 --> 13:55.570
This is going to be the end
of it and I apologize.

13:55.603 --> 13:57.605
- Come on, man.
- Dude, I'm a fuck up.

13:57.639 --> 14:00.341
I fucked up, I'm sorry, okay.

14:03.511 --> 14:06.447
Dude, I'm sorry there were cops
everywhere, you weren't...

14:06.480 --> 14:11.085
Ugh, what's going on?

14:11.118 --> 14:13.454
Hey ma'am, you gotta
get out of the car.

14:13.487 --> 14:15.456
You got to get out of the car.

14:15.489 --> 14:16.624
- This is stolen, okay?
- I don't care,

14:16.658 --> 14:18.258
I haven't slept in three days.

14:18.292 --> 14:20.427
I'm all fucked up on their shit
and my phone is dead.

14:20.461 --> 14:23.464
Okay, um, it's going to be
worse if the cops come

14:23.497 --> 14:25.099
and find you in the stolen car.

14:25.132 --> 14:26.568
You're going to go to jail.
So please get out.

14:26.601 --> 14:28.969
Jail is warm,
just leave me alone.

14:29.002 --> 14:30.471
Look.

14:30.505 --> 14:32.072
Ma'am. Get out.

14:32.106 --> 14:33.006
You want me out of the car,
mother fucker?

14:33.040 --> 14:36.578
- Yes, get the fuck out.
- Great, drag me out.

14:41.716 --> 14:44.051
This... this is the wrong woman,
okay?

14:44.084 --> 14:45.520
She's fucking crazy.

14:45.553 --> 14:49.022
Dude, she knows our name,
she knows our faces.

14:49.056 --> 14:51.125
We gotta... Dude, Andy!

14:51.158 --> 14:53.994
I'm thinking.
Shut up, I'm thinking deeply.

14:54.027 --> 14:55.229
What?

14:55.262 --> 14:58.365
What's your big thought?

14:58.399 --> 15:00.702
Hi miss, Bonnie.

15:00.735 --> 15:03.971
What if we promise you
somewhere warm to sleep?

15:04.004 --> 15:06.340
A warmer place,
a cozy place to sleep.

15:06.373 --> 15:09.109
Very, very cozy.

15:15.617 --> 15:19.019
Home sweet home.

15:19.052 --> 15:21.723
This is our... this is our set up.

15:21.756 --> 15:23.490
- So.
- I'm taking this one.

15:23.525 --> 15:26.326
Yeah of course,
wherever you want.

15:26.360 --> 15:28.996
Mess me with me and I'll cut
your fucking dicks off.

15:29.029 --> 15:30.464
What do you think? What do you
think we're like wolves

15:30.497 --> 15:32.567
in the woods or something?

15:32.600 --> 15:34.201
Just don't mess with me.

15:34.234 --> 15:36.236
Bonnie, Bill and I we are
two real gentlemen.

15:36.270 --> 15:37.572
We don't mess with the ladies.

15:37.605 --> 15:39.473
Congratulations.

15:39.507 --> 15:44.344
Good for you guys.

15:44.378 --> 15:46.280
Bill? Bill.

15:46.313 --> 15:47.582
Where do I sleep?

15:47.615 --> 15:50.083
Where do you think, dude?

16:03.297 --> 16:05.700
Hey.

16:05.733 --> 16:07.569
Hey.

16:07.602 --> 16:09.036
- Mm?
- Do you want to buy me

16:09.069 --> 16:11.171
a phone charger
and some breakfast?

16:15.543 --> 16:18.345
I'm sorry
I can't afford the bacon.

16:18.378 --> 16:20.080
It's okay,
this all tastes like steak

16:20.113 --> 16:21.716
compared to the shit inside.

16:21.749 --> 16:23.217
Yes.

16:23.250 --> 16:24.485
What? You've been
in the nuthouse?

16:24.519 --> 16:26.153
Yeah, very much.

16:26.186 --> 16:28.690
You and me, we spend
a lot of time in that place.

16:28.723 --> 16:30.324
Why were you in there?

16:30.357 --> 16:33.126
When I grew up in China
I felt like an alien.

16:33.160 --> 16:36.029
People around me and nobody
understand what I do.

16:36.063 --> 16:40.133
Nobody appreciative
of what I do.

16:40.167 --> 16:43.036
They don't understand
Grateful Dead.

16:43.070 --> 16:47.040
Nine Inch Nails,
Allman Brothers, b... anyway.

16:47.074 --> 16:48.743
So I feel like,
oh, I come to America.

16:48.776 --> 16:50.077
I got a Green Card.

16:50.110 --> 16:51.478
English named Andy.

16:51.513 --> 16:53.347
But I feel more lonely
than before.

16:53.380 --> 16:56.551
People around me also listen
to soulless, heartless music.

16:56.584 --> 16:58.418
EDM, fuck that.

16:58.452 --> 17:00.822
So I was like, ugh,
I'm going like a man on...

17:00.855 --> 17:03.490
I'm like a man on an island.

17:03.525 --> 17:04.559
Very fucking lonely.

17:04.592 --> 17:06.193
So I weep, weep.

17:06.226 --> 17:08.530
After that I weep, weep, weep.

17:08.563 --> 17:10.497
That's just too much weeping.

17:10.532 --> 17:13.333
I stay long, eventually
they put me in Garden Oaks

17:13.367 --> 17:14.736
where I meet Bill.

17:17.237 --> 17:19.406
Hey.

17:19.439 --> 17:22.810
You look like the kind of guy
who could use a best friend.

17:22.844 --> 17:25.613
I ain't gonna lie,
I'm that kind of guy too.

17:28.215 --> 17:30.217
So why did you go in?

17:30.250 --> 17:32.386
I've been in many times.

17:32.419 --> 17:35.088
This time I was just being loud.

17:35.122 --> 17:36.390
I don't have anywhere
to live right now

17:36.423 --> 17:38.593
so I just... I stay
with my sister sometimes

17:38.626 --> 17:41.729
but most of the time
she just kicks me out.

17:41.763 --> 17:44.464
And a few weeks ago
I had a cut on my foot

17:44.498 --> 17:47.835
and the only place I could wash
it was in a drinking fountain.

17:47.869 --> 17:50.304
So I was just minding my own
business washing my foot

17:50.337 --> 17:52.406
and everybody was
just staring at me

17:52.439 --> 17:54.809
- like I was shit.
- They are wrong.

17:54.842 --> 17:56.209
You are very much.

17:56.243 --> 17:57.210
Thanks.

17:57.244 --> 17:59.581
Well, I was yelling at them

17:59.614 --> 18:01.549
and I think I scared them
and it just freaked

18:01.583 --> 18:03.483
everyone out
and so they called the cops

18:03.518 --> 18:05.285
and they took me
to Sterling Springs

18:05.319 --> 18:06.754
and I mean,
you know how it goes.

18:06.788 --> 18:08.790
Yup, that much I know.

18:12.760 --> 18:15.462
Bonnie, I'm glad you are crazy.

18:15.495 --> 18:17.297
I'm not.

18:17.331 --> 18:19.634
Even me, I'm crazy,
I wish nobody was.

18:19.667 --> 18:21.636
I wish nobody crazy
but when I'm near you

18:21.669 --> 18:24.572
and close to you
I feel so fucking awesome.

18:24.606 --> 18:27.575
I feel like you seem
to have an understanding.

18:27.609 --> 18:30.210
It's manic depression,
that'll do that.

18:30.243 --> 18:33.748
Yeah that's the word
that they throw at me.

18:33.781 --> 18:35.215
Well, what's wrong
with your friend?

18:35.248 --> 18:36.851
Bill? Bill is okay.

18:36.884 --> 18:38.452
There is totally
nothing wrong with him.

18:38.485 --> 18:40.555
No, why was he in Golden Oaks?

18:40.588 --> 18:43.156
You remember 9/11?

18:55.570 --> 18:57.337
Before we even knew
what happened

18:57.371 --> 19:00.908
things were moving around,
shifting around.

19:00.942 --> 19:05.813
Uh, I mean, my mind went
right to the attack in '93.

19:05.847 --> 19:08.448
Desks were moving, chairs,

19:08.482 --> 19:10.283
we could literally see
the floor...

19:10.317 --> 19:11.719
Bill was a totally lover.

19:11.753 --> 19:13.387
He hates terrorists.

19:13.420 --> 19:15.657
So he decided to be the
opposite.

19:15.690 --> 19:19.493
- He decided to be a joyist.
- A what?

19:19.527 --> 19:22.797
A person who supply the love
and the joy to the world.

19:22.830 --> 19:24.532
Joy? Oh a joyist?

19:24.565 --> 19:26.299
Mhm, mhm.

20:02.970 --> 20:05.807
Many, many hours passed
but no people

20:05.840 --> 20:07.441
would take any donuts.

20:07.474 --> 20:08.910
So he spread no joy.

20:08.943 --> 20:10.578
Only more terror.

20:13.881 --> 20:15.282
It's on, I'll be right back.

20:15.315 --> 20:19.020
Okay.

My sister says
I can stay with her.

21:04.766 --> 21:05.867
She doesn't want me to be there

21:05.900 --> 21:07.802
until she's gone tomorrow night,
so.

21:07.835 --> 21:11.672
Come to my place, stay with me.

21:11.706 --> 21:14.374
You don't think... I feel like
I'm bothering your friend.

21:14.407 --> 21:15.877
I don't want to
upset him anymore.

21:15.910 --> 21:16.878
You'll like Bill.

21:16.911 --> 21:19.881
You'll like him, I can tell.

21:19.914 --> 21:21.481

21:38.599 --> 21:41.936
Bill, I take Bonnie out
for breakfast.

21:41.969 --> 21:44.038
You eat all the special cookies.

21:44.071 --> 21:46.707
You enjoy yourself.

21:46.741 --> 21:49.342
Sorry I was hiding them.

21:49.376 --> 21:52.814
But save one for me.
Love, Andy.

21:52.847 --> 21:57.718
Fuck yes, bring this women
into our lives, dude.

21:57.752 --> 22:00.353
Show her your golden heart.

22:15.536 --> 22:17.104
Which way?

22:21.474 --> 22:24.779
Ugh.

22:31.686 --> 22:33.120
No, no, no, that's okay.

22:33.154 --> 22:34.522
Sorry.

22:34.555 --> 22:37.825
It's okay.

22:37.859 --> 22:40.695
Bonnie, you see that's Angel.

22:40.728 --> 22:43.496
That pine tree,
that's Max, that's Max.

22:43.531 --> 22:44.999
You always name the trees
like this?

22:45.032 --> 22:46.968
No, just now for you.

22:47.001 --> 22:50.171
To entertain you,
to make you happy.

22:50.204 --> 22:52.573
Why are you always trying
to entertain me?

22:52.607 --> 22:55.408
If I tell you that you'll think
I'm crazy... more crazy.

22:55.442 --> 22:58.478
- No I won't just tell me.
- Nope.

22:58.512 --> 23:00.748
Nope.

23:00.781 --> 23:02.917
Well, I have a secret
about you too, you know.

23:02.950 --> 23:04.185
- Yeah?
- Mhm.

23:04.218 --> 23:05.887
- Tell me.
- No you tell me first

23:05.920 --> 23:07.521
and then I'll tell you.

23:07.555 --> 23:12.860
Ugh.

23:12.894 --> 23:16.597
You know that tonight you are my
cover from the sturdiest winds,

23:16.631 --> 23:18.633
you are shinning with the light,
golden,

23:18.666 --> 23:21.836
a coherent song, echoing when
people touch their wine glass.

23:21.869 --> 23:25.006
Whaa, whaa, whaa, whaa,

23:25.039 --> 23:26.807
You just think I'm pretty.

23:26.841 --> 23:29.442
You're more than pretty,
you are golden, solid gold.

23:29.476 --> 23:30.544
No, I'm not golden.

23:30.578 --> 23:34.682
You might be but I'm not.

23:34.715 --> 23:35.950
Here hand me the bottle.

23:35.983 --> 23:39.120

24:06.180 --> 24:07.648
Quit looking at us.

24:07.682 --> 24:09.884
Stop looking at me!

24:09.917 --> 24:11.619
We have a life.

24:11.652 --> 24:13.254
Get to your own fucking life.

Sh, come here, come here.

24:15.122 --> 24:16.123
What are you doing?

24:16.157 --> 24:18.192
People these days.

24:18.225 --> 24:20.261
- People!
- You're an idiot.

24:20.294 --> 24:25.199
People.

24:25.232 --> 24:26.567
What are you doing?

24:26.600 --> 24:27.635
Bonnie, let me od this.

24:27.668 --> 24:28.936
Your eye's fine, trust me.

24:28.970 --> 24:32.606
Just let me do this, trust me.

24:32.640 --> 24:34.108
They lied to you.

24:34.141 --> 24:37.211
They lied to you, you see,
it's fine, it's healing.

24:37.244 --> 24:41.015
Uh, that feels so good.

24:45.686 --> 24:47.922
Sorry.

25:45.146 --> 25:47.748
How... how's it going?

25:47.782 --> 25:50.251
It's good, good... Can you... Can
you leave tonight?

25:50.284 --> 25:51.252
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

25:51.285 --> 25:52.753
What's going on?

25:52.787 --> 25:56.991
So Bonnie and me
we kiss on the street.

25:57.024 --> 25:58.759
Can you sneak out on the back?

25:58.793 --> 26:00.628
- Yeah.
- Thank you so much.

26:00.661 --> 26:04.231
Yeah of course, dude, of course.

26:04.265 --> 26:05.933
- Can you just do me one favor?
- Yeah.

26:05.966 --> 26:08.002
If you get a chance to make love

26:08.035 --> 26:09.703
just don't wear a condom, okay?

26:09.737 --> 26:11.005
- You got it.
- You promise?

26:11.038 --> 26:12.306
- Yeah.
- Get her disease,

26:12.339 --> 26:14.742
- make babies, be real.
- Make love.

26:14.775 --> 26:16.077
Okay, I'm serious though.

26:16.110 --> 26:17.711
- She's here.
- I know, I know

26:17.745 --> 26:19.880
but this isn't robot rubber
big life, okay?

26:19.914 --> 26:21.949
- She's... she's here.
- All right, just promise me.

26:21.982 --> 26:23.150
- I promise you.
- All right, just say

26:23.184 --> 26:25.052
"I promise I won't
use a condom."

26:25.086 --> 26:26.153
I promise you.

26:26.187 --> 26:27.288
I know but say, "I promise."

26:27.321 --> 26:29.757
- I promise.
- "I won't use a condom."

26:29.790 --> 26:31.792
- Please.
- I promise whatever promise.

26:31.826 --> 26:33.360
Go, go, go, she's here.

26:33.394 --> 26:34.762
- What?
- Why are you being difficult?

26:34.795 --> 26:37.698
- Just promise.
- Dude, she's here.

26:37.731 --> 26:39.667
I know but I don't believe you
until you say it.

26:39.700 --> 26:41.202
Say "I promise
I wont use a condom."

26:41.235 --> 26:43.270
I don't like people
forcing me promises.

26:43.304 --> 26:45.806
- Look at me, I'm uncomfortable.
- I don't care.

26:45.840 --> 26:47.908
I'm not gonna leave
until you do it.

26:47.942 --> 26:49.210
Dude, you said you'd leave.

26:49.243 --> 26:51.412
Once you promise me.

26:51.445 --> 26:53.347
Why is this promise
so important to you?

26:53.380 --> 26:55.716
Because dude, you haven't
made love in like three years.

26:55.749 --> 26:56.984
- I will do that.
- All right, well say

26:57.017 --> 26:57.985
"I promise I won't
wear a condom."

26:58.018 --> 26:59.720
I'm not going to fucking
do a promise to this.

26:59.753 --> 27:02.189
Yes you do,
I'm your man. Say it.

27:02.223 --> 27:04.425
- Okay, I promise you.
- Promise me what?

27:04.458 --> 27:06.227
I promise you
we will not wear a condom.

27:06.260 --> 27:07.428
Okay, great you got it.

27:07.461 --> 27:09.230
Go seal it.

27:11.999 --> 27:14.435
I'll see you later.

27:25.112 --> 27:27.915
Hey cigarettes.

27:27.948 --> 27:29.950
You gotta do it, huh.

27:29.984 --> 27:32.453
- You got one for me?
- Last one, buddy.

27:32.486 --> 27:34.421
Last one?

27:34.455 --> 27:37.024
All right.

27:37.057 --> 27:38.125
I don't care.

27:40.261 --> 27:43.063
Last night you live in
your house before it burns down.

28:04.351 --> 28:05.886
Oh my god.

28:27.007 --> 28:29.843
- Boo!
- Fuck.

28:29.877 --> 28:32.479
- You scared me.
- Join the club.

28:32.514 --> 28:34.215
- Where's our An-Man?
- He went to the store

28:34.248 --> 28:36.116
to get some food.

28:36.150 --> 28:37.218
Very cool.

28:37.251 --> 28:38.852
What is that?

28:38.886 --> 28:41.255
That is treasure.

28:41.288 --> 28:44.258
So you and my buddy?

28:44.291 --> 28:45.893
You're in a relationship now,
huh?

28:45.926 --> 28:47.361
I mean, we had a good day
together.

28:47.394 --> 28:48.929
And a fun night, right?

28:48.963 --> 28:50.898
I don't think that's any
of your business, Bill.

28:50.931 --> 28:53.367
Well, you know, my business,
not my business.

28:53.400 --> 28:55.302
I don't really keep track
of that kind of thing.

28:55.336 --> 28:56.937
- I see that.
- They call it making love

28:56.971 --> 28:57.972
for a reason, right?

28:58.005 --> 28:59.440
Sex seals relationships.

28:59.473 --> 29:01.108
So you guys,
you're together now.

29:01.141 --> 29:02.943
That's not how I do things.

29:02.977 --> 29:05.212
Yeah but that mother fucker
out there getting breakfast,

29:05.246 --> 29:07.214
I mean, he's a mad man.

29:07.248 --> 29:09.250
- Yeah, I'm right there with yah.
- Okay.

29:09.283 --> 29:11.919
So then you know that
mad men and mad women

29:11.952 --> 29:13.287
feel things differently.

29:13.320 --> 29:16.290
And Andy feels things hard.

29:16.323 --> 29:17.525
Really hard.

29:17.559 --> 29:19.827
So if you guys made love

29:19.860 --> 29:22.930
or even if like you just
held his hand for a minute

29:22.963 --> 29:24.398
he's going to be
in love with you.

29:24.431 --> 29:26.400
You know, that's... that's
the way mad men work

29:26.433 --> 29:27.868
and it's the way I work.

29:27.901 --> 29:29.470
And that's why Andy and me,

29:29.504 --> 29:31.205
we're in mother fucking love.

29:31.238 --> 29:32.574
You two are in love?

29:32.607 --> 29:34.041
It's just platonic

29:34.074 --> 29:35.309
but it's very, very deep

29:35.342 --> 29:36.944
and it might even be stronger

29:36.977 --> 29:38.312
than what you guys could form

29:38.345 --> 29:40.214
because there's no
sexual complications

29:40.247 --> 29:41.549
or anything like that.

29:41.583 --> 29:44.351
But if you are with Andy

29:44.385 --> 29:46.120
you're also with me.

29:46.153 --> 29:48.355
I don't understand
what you're saying.

29:48.389 --> 29:51.859
I'm talking about that me
and Andy are friend-married.

29:51.892 --> 29:55.396
One, two, three, friend-married.

30:00.568 --> 30:02.002
I love you.

30:02.036 --> 30:04.872
I could feel my blood
going into him

30:04.905 --> 30:07.341
and I could feel
his blood going into me

30:07.374 --> 30:09.043
and it was just
like from then on

30:09.076 --> 30:10.444
we're both each other's dad's

30:10.477 --> 30:12.946
and then we're also
both each other's sons.

30:12.980 --> 30:15.416
But once you come into this

30:15.449 --> 30:17.585
you're not going
to be my daughter.

30:17.619 --> 30:19.320
You know what
you're going to be?

30:19.353 --> 30:20.888
What? What am I?

30:20.921 --> 30:23.223
You're gonna be my mommy.

30:23.257 --> 30:24.526
You know what I mean?

30:24.559 --> 30:26.393
Like, just like take care of me,

30:26.427 --> 30:29.129
nurture me, just mommy stuff,
you know, it's like...

30:30.598 --> 30:33.367
Change my poopy diappy, mommy.

30:33.400 --> 30:35.402
You know,
just joking way like...

30:38.072 --> 30:39.507
Hey, what's going on?

30:39.541 --> 30:41.609
Oh, I was just telling Bonnie

30:41.643 --> 30:43.177
that she's my mommy
and you love her.

30:43.210 --> 30:45.412
- Oh.
- You love her, right?

30:45.446 --> 30:48.482
- Yeah.
- See? Told you.

30:48.516 --> 30:50.618
This nutball's in love.

30:50.652 --> 30:52.286
Well, I got you guys
some burritos.

30:52.319 --> 30:55.322
- Oh hell yeah.
- Burritos for everyone.

30:55.356 --> 31:00.060
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

31:00.094 --> 31:03.931
It's good.

31:30.692 --> 31:31.593
- Hey.
- Hey.

31:31.626 --> 31:33.260
- How's it going?
- Good, how are you?

31:33.293 --> 31:35.062
I'm okay.

31:35.095 --> 31:36.296
Did I beat Andy here or?

31:36.330 --> 31:38.399
No, he's just in the bathroom.

31:38.432 --> 31:40.568
Ah, so you're pretty rich huh?

31:40.602 --> 31:43.036
Uh, it's my sister's.

31:43.070 --> 31:44.639
Oh yeah.

31:44.672 --> 31:48.308
Well hey, I have an idea.

31:48.342 --> 31:51.111
What if we drink
all your sister's booze?

31:51.145 --> 31:54.381
- You into that?
- I'm into that.

31:54.415 --> 31:56.150
Bonnie Mommy,
I knew I liked you.

31:58.419 --> 32:00.421
Hey, it's the man of the hour.

32:00.454 --> 32:01.955
- How's it going?
- Good, real happy

32:01.989 --> 32:03.424
- to see you.
- All right, count to 20,

32:03.457 --> 32:07.060
- you ready?
- Mhm.

32:07.094 --> 32:08.630
So this is when
they were in a meeting

32:08.663 --> 32:11.699
and this PowerPoint presentation
on...

32:11.733 --> 32:14.101
social media interactivity
or something like that

32:14.134 --> 32:16.671
and all of a sudden,
in the light of the projector

32:16.704 --> 32:18.606
is this shadow.

32:18.640 --> 32:21.475
And I look over
and there's this coke can

32:21.509 --> 32:23.243
that was on the middle
of the conference table,

32:23.277 --> 32:25.513
has risen up
and it was just floating

32:25.547 --> 32:27.247
in the light of the projector.

32:27.281 --> 32:29.983
- That's crazy.
- I just like stopped breathing.

32:30.017 --> 32:33.487
I was blown away, I'm like
wh... what... how is this happening?

32:33.521 --> 32:37.257
And I look around and all of
a sudden my boss stops talking,

32:37.291 --> 32:39.493
snatches it out of the air

32:39.527 --> 32:42.029
and then just finishes
the presentation.

32:42.062 --> 32:44.131
- What the fuck?
- Yeah and then everyone

32:44.164 --> 32:45.633
just gets up to leave

32:45.667 --> 32:48.368
and I'm like, we just saw
a fucking divine thing

32:48.402 --> 32:50.003
you numbskulls.

32:50.037 --> 32:51.338
What'd they say
when you said that?

32:51.371 --> 32:53.340
I didn't actually say that,
not then.

32:53.373 --> 32:55.008
- You should've said it.
- Sh, sh.

32:55.042 --> 32:56.544
I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, sorry, sorry.

32:56.578 --> 32:59.179
And so later that night
I go home to tell my husband

32:59.213 --> 33:02.550
about it and he's like "So what?
You believe in God now?"

33:02.584 --> 33:07.387
And I'm like
"Yeah, I believe in God

33:07.421 --> 33:08.756
and I believe he spoke to me."

33:08.790 --> 33:11.391
- And you know what he said?
- Drink coke?

33:11.425 --> 33:15.429
- No.
- Wait, drink Pepsi.

33:15.462 --> 33:16.698
No.

33:16.731 --> 33:18.298
He said the opposite.

33:18.332 --> 33:20.300
You know, he blocked
that profane light

33:20.334 --> 33:22.737
with God's light to tell me that
the life that I was leading

33:22.770 --> 33:27.341
- was shit and I deserve better.
- Yeah, it makes sense.

33:27.374 --> 33:29.711
That impetus that moment where
God showed himself to me

33:29.744 --> 33:31.646
was real, I wasn't crazy
in that moment.

33:31.679 --> 33:33.380
It's just, you know,
when I told people

33:33.413 --> 33:35.683
I... I think I shouted it.

33:35.717 --> 33:38.285
Yeah, it's like a passionate
thing to say, right.

33:38.318 --> 33:41.221
Yeah, well,
I shouted a lot of things.

33:41.255 --> 33:43.825
I went around trying
to find any kind of messages

33:43.858 --> 33:45.359
that I could find.

33:45.392 --> 33:47.662
Only I think I was imagining it
most of the time

33:47.695 --> 33:50.197
and then I just... I don't know,

33:50.230 --> 33:52.734
I just kind of lost it
and I became homeless

33:52.767 --> 33:55.570
and lost my friends
and you know how it goes.

33:55.603 --> 33:57.070
You know, people are mean.

33:57.104 --> 33:59.206
- People are...
- Sh, sh, sh.

33:59.239 --> 34:01.375
Just the life I'm leading now
is so much better

34:01.408 --> 34:05.212
than the life I was leading
with my stupid husband.

34:05.245 --> 34:06.814
- Life with Andy.
- Huh?

34:06.848 --> 34:09.651
That's the life you're living
now, life with Andy.

34:09.684 --> 34:11.285
And let me tell you,

34:11.318 --> 34:13.755
that's as good as it gets.

34:13.788 --> 34:15.657
Yes of course.

34:15.690 --> 34:17.491
So far so good

34:17.525 --> 34:19.561
and it's only going
to get better.

34:19.594 --> 34:21.361
I promise.

34:21.395 --> 34:23.397
Okay, I trust you.

34:31.906 --> 34:33.575
- Shoot the dragon.
- Right there?

34:33.608 --> 34:36.711
- Yeah.
- Ugh.

34:36.744 --> 34:39.446
I'm gonna get him.

34:39.479 --> 34:42.182
He dead, he dead.

34:42.215 --> 34:45.152
He's dead.

34:49.256 --> 34:50.625
He's dead.

34:52.292 --> 34:54.127
What was the dragon's name?

34:54.161 --> 34:56.330
Um, The Red One.

34:56.363 --> 34:58.131
- The Red One?
- Yeah.

34:58.165 --> 35:00.668
He goes, de-blah.

35:00.702 --> 35:02.336
He dead.

35:07.875 --> 35:09.510
- Bill?
- Yeah.

35:09.544 --> 35:12.614
- You are the dragon.
- Shut the fuck up.

35:27.862 --> 35:28.930
Mm.

35:28.963 --> 35:30.665
Hey, sorry.

35:30.698 --> 35:31.933
- Um.
- What are you doing

35:31.966 --> 35:34.736
- in my room?
- So I just um,

35:34.769 --> 35:36.303
I think you might be pregnant.

35:36.336 --> 35:37.437
No, I can't get pregnant.

35:37.471 --> 35:38.840
Trust me, I tried hard.

35:38.873 --> 35:40.307
What do you mean you tried?

35:40.340 --> 35:41.441
You feel like you
had a lot of love?

35:41.475 --> 35:43.443
You made a lot of love or what?

35:43.477 --> 35:45.278
No like vitamins, hormones, IVF.

35:45.312 --> 35:47.247
I don't... It's none
of your business.

35:47.280 --> 35:50.518
Okay, I had a dream
that me and you and Andy

35:50.551 --> 35:53.487
and our son were walking through
the forest

35:53.521 --> 35:56.223
and we killed a dragon
and ate it

35:56.256 --> 35:58.291
but when I have dreams
this vivid

35:58.325 --> 36:00.595
and this intense it usually
means there's something

36:00.628 --> 36:02.897
- true about it, okay?
- Mhm.

36:02.930 --> 36:04.799
I just think you might
want to piss on a test

36:04.832 --> 36:08.368
and lay off the sauce
'cause you could really

36:08.402 --> 36:11.204
- possibly be pregnant.
- Okay, sure.

36:11.238 --> 36:13.340
Just get out,
you're gonna wake Andy.

36:13.373 --> 36:14.742
I'm not gonna wake that guy,
dude.

36:14.776 --> 36:17.545
He'll sleep through anything,
watch.

36:17.578 --> 36:18.579
- What are you doing?
- Oh shit.

36:18.613 --> 36:20.480
Sorry Andy.

36:20.515 --> 36:22.349
Um, did you just dream
about dragons?

36:22.382 --> 36:25.419
- No why?
- No reason.

36:25.452 --> 36:27.655
No reason at all.

36:27.689 --> 36:29.256
You got room
for one more in here?

36:29.289 --> 36:30.525
Mm, yeah.

36:52.747 --> 36:55.917
Uh Andy, good to see you dude.

36:55.950 --> 36:57.919
Here, you want some yellow rice?

36:57.952 --> 37:01.022
Mhm.

37:01.055 --> 37:03.725
Mm.

37:03.758 --> 37:05.292
What's going on?

37:05.325 --> 37:08.029
- Dude, you were right.
- Dr. Thrust is gay?

37:08.062 --> 37:09.664
I knew it, dude,
I fucking knew it.

37:09.697 --> 37:11.766
It's Bonnie, Bonnie pregnant.

37:11.799 --> 37:13.400
Dude, why are you so glum?

37:13.433 --> 37:14.736
That's amazing.

37:14.769 --> 37:16.436
That's great, dude.

37:16.470 --> 37:17.972
You think a women's good
to have around?

37:18.005 --> 37:20.340
Dude, a baby
is ten times better.

37:20.373 --> 37:21.809
A baby's like a ball
of pure light.

37:21.843 --> 37:23.410
Nothing's better than a baby!

37:23.443 --> 37:24.679
This is great.

37:24.712 --> 37:25.947
You don't have to feed the baby.

37:25.980 --> 37:27.481
I just fed you, didn't I?

37:27.515 --> 37:28.816
I'm a natural, come on here.

37:28.850 --> 37:29.884
No, no, whatever you say

37:29.917 --> 37:31.284
you don't have to buy the food.

37:31.318 --> 37:35.489
Dude, look, do you love Bonnie?

37:35.523 --> 37:37.491
You love life? You love babies?

37:37.525 --> 37:38.860
Then look what you have, man.

37:38.893 --> 37:40.628
This is good for us, okay.

37:40.661 --> 37:42.395
- I just don't...
- Don't... no, don't act like

37:42.429 --> 37:43.865
this is a bad thing, come on.

37:43.898 --> 37:45.566
I just don't want to get a job.

37:45.600 --> 37:47.367
Who the fuck said
you have to get a job?

37:47.400 --> 37:49.003
Baby costs so much money,
I'll have to get a job.

37:49.036 --> 37:51.404
No dude, you don't need a job
you just need money.

37:51.438 --> 37:53.574
- I have to get a job.
- No dude, money.

37:53.608 --> 37:57.578
- Listen to me, a job.
- No, dude.

37:57.612 --> 38:00.948
You just need money, okay.

38:02.817 --> 38:06.821
We need to get like shotguns,
AKs, Uzis.

38:06.854 --> 38:08.723
If they're not real they've
got to be real enough looking

38:08.756 --> 38:11.626
to fool a little
near-sighted bank guard.

38:11.659 --> 38:13.393
Here he come snow.

38:13.426 --> 38:16.597
Psh, look at this wimp.

38:16.631 --> 38:19.399
They should've hired us
to guard this bank.

38:19.432 --> 38:20.668
You think you could
take this guy out?

38:20.701 --> 38:21.803
Yeah, easy.

38:21.836 --> 38:23.470
Fuck yeah, dude.

38:23.504 --> 38:26.841
One solid Chinese kick
to the chest, he's down.

38:26.874 --> 38:28.876
All right, what do we got?

38:28.910 --> 38:31.746
We've got a shotgun, new shoes...

38:31.779 --> 38:35.850
- Running shoes.
- Yeah, okay, running shoes.

38:35.883 --> 38:38.686
- What else?
- Latex gloves, pantyhose.

38:38.719 --> 38:40.021
- Pantyhose.
- Yeah.

38:40.054 --> 38:42.089
- Distraction mannequin.
- Perfect.

38:42.123 --> 38:44.692
- Energy bars.
- Pumpkin pie.

38:44.725 --> 38:46.928
- Chocolate, chocolate.
- Both, both.

38:46.961 --> 38:49.462
Okay, black... black clothes.

38:49.496 --> 38:51.966
- Perfect.
- Mhm.

38:51.999 --> 38:54.802
Goddamn, look at that
juicy bank, buddy.

38:54.836 --> 38:56.804
I can already taste it.

38:56.838 --> 38:58.673
Taste what?

38:58.706 --> 39:00.508
Red wine.

39:00.541 --> 39:04.111
- Come on, let's go.
- Okay.

39:04.145 --> 39:06.080
I don't know what Mitchel
told you but uh...

39:06.113 --> 39:08.115
- Whoa, whoa.
- Oh sorry.

39:08.149 --> 39:10.718
- How do you?
- It's right there.

39:10.751 --> 39:13.420
- Keep that there.
- I'm actually going on safari,

39:13.453 --> 39:15.523
hunting gorillas.

39:15.556 --> 39:17.692
Pretty aggressive breed
actually.

39:17.725 --> 39:19.426
They uh, they tend to
come at you all at once

39:19.459 --> 39:23.064
when you take their bananas
from their banana banks.

39:23.097 --> 39:25.766
- You know what I mean?
- I don't and I don't want to.

39:25.800 --> 39:28.903
Um, I would go with
the shotgun here though.

39:28.936 --> 39:31.706
- Okay.
- I could do uh, $300 on it.

39:31.739 --> 39:33.406
Okay.

39:33.440 --> 39:35.442
Um, here's the deal
I'm gonna have to pay you

39:35.475 --> 39:37.511
after I get the bananas.

39:37.545 --> 39:39.080
See cause I'm broke.

39:39.113 --> 39:42.449
But once I do the gun thing
I'll have the money to pay you.

39:42.482 --> 39:43.851
All right, you know what,
you gotta go man.

39:43.885 --> 39:45.519
- What?
- You gotta go.

39:45.553 --> 39:46.754
I'm gonna pay you
whatever you want.

39:46.787 --> 39:48.556
You gotta go, okay.

39:48.589 --> 39:50.457
I just don't have money right
now.

39:50.490 --> 39:51.792
That's why you gotta go.

39:51.826 --> 39:53.160
I'm not really scared of guns.

39:53.194 --> 39:55.897
- Please go.
- Okay, okay.

39:55.930 --> 39:57.131
You missed an opportunity.

40:02.136 --> 40:04.437
Bill, what did you do
last night?

40:04.471 --> 40:06.841
I just went at looked at
the cat.

40:06.874 --> 40:08.676
What's that mean?

40:08.709 --> 40:11.712
Uh, like 18 months ago
me and Andy

40:11.746 --> 40:14.715
found this dead cat
in like an empty lot.

40:14.749 --> 40:16.117
We've just been
watching it decompose

40:16.150 --> 40:18.519
every time we walk by

40:18.552 --> 40:19.987
and it's in this
awesome stage now.

40:20.021 --> 40:23.624
Like it's bones
have turned into these like

40:23.658 --> 40:25.593
little glistening toothpicks
in the dirt.

40:25.626 --> 40:26.894
It's really beautiful actually,
so.

40:26.928 --> 40:30.998
Bill, Bonnie and I,
we are eating.

40:31.032 --> 40:32.499
- It's okay.
- Good for you,

40:32.533 --> 40:36.170
I gotta go to the bathroom.

41:02.930 --> 41:05.599
Jesus.

41:05.633 --> 41:08.002
Bonnie, I saw a black widow
run in here so I just...

41:08.035 --> 41:10.805
I saw you take
my sister's jewelry.

41:10.838 --> 41:12.540
- You're a terrible liar.
- All right, fine,

41:12.573 --> 41:14.909
I'm sorry, here.

41:14.942 --> 41:17.211
You win, okay? Sorry.

41:17.244 --> 41:18.980
No harm, no foul okay?

41:19.013 --> 41:21.515
What... what are you guys
doing in there?

41:21.549 --> 41:23.684
Oh we're just talking about
a bunch of sports scores.

41:23.718 --> 41:26.687
Just shit you don't like.
Basketball stuff.

41:26.721 --> 41:28.823
He as stealing
my sister's jewelry.

41:28.856 --> 41:29.991
Do you have any idea
what my sister would do

41:30.024 --> 41:31.192
if she thought
I was stealing from her?

41:31.225 --> 41:32.760
Huh, Bill?
I'd be homeless again.

41:32.793 --> 41:34.695
Well, you wouldn't be
homeless again.

41:34.729 --> 41:36.831
I would never let
that happen to us, okay.

41:36.864 --> 41:38.666
And I wasn't stealing her stuff.

41:38.699 --> 41:40.901
I was borrowing it to pawn it,
okay.

41:40.935 --> 41:43.838
What do you need it for?

41:43.871 --> 41:44.872
I can't... I can't tell you
that part.

41:44.905 --> 41:46.707
Andy, what's going on?

41:46.741 --> 41:48.709
I don't want to deal
with this shit.

41:48.743 --> 41:50.177
- Don't tell her.
- What so you're just gonna

41:50.211 --> 41:52.079
- walk away from this?
- Yeah, he just... he just...

41:52.113 --> 41:53.781
let him be... let him
be away from this,

41:53.814 --> 41:55.116
you're whipping something up
here.

41:55.149 --> 41:57.218
Bill, why did you take the gold?

41:57.251 --> 42:00.554
I can't tell you, okay.

42:00.588 --> 42:02.323
It just was really, really,
really important.

42:02.356 --> 42:05.659
I'll find another way but it
was the first plan, you know.

42:05.693 --> 42:07.995
Please,
what is this noble cause?

42:08.029 --> 42:09.764
It's like a cool glorious thing

42:09.797 --> 42:11.565
but I just can't tell you, okay.

42:11.599 --> 42:12.833
What, you don't trust me?

42:12.867 --> 42:14.769
No, I mean, honestly

42:14.802 --> 42:16.871
with this kind of info
I'm not there with you yet.

42:16.904 --> 42:19.273
I don't trust you, so.

42:19.306 --> 42:22.043
I'm sorr... Bonnie,
what do you want from me?

42:22.076 --> 42:23.711
How can I tell you
my biggest secret

42:23.744 --> 42:25.946
of what I'm going to do,
you know what I mean?

42:25.980 --> 42:28.682
Bill, tell me.

42:28.716 --> 42:31.986
Can I... can I... you promise you
won't tell anybody else?

42:32.019 --> 42:33.654
- Yeah.
- All right, I'm robbing a bank.

42:33.687 --> 42:35.322
Me and Andy are robbing a bank.

42:35.356 --> 42:36.690
What the fuck? What?

42:36.724 --> 42:38.259
What's so funny about that?

42:38.292 --> 42:40.594
- You're not robbing a bank.
- Yes I am and so is...

42:40.628 --> 42:43.664
Yeah, Andy's going to come in
there with a fucking six shooter

42:43.697 --> 42:46.767
and I'm going to be being like
watch... watch...

42:46.801 --> 42:48.135
I'm going to tell
all the fucking tellers

42:48.169 --> 42:49.970
"That mother fucker's going
to kill you."

42:50.004 --> 42:52.106
I gather up the money and we
leave and then you have money.

42:52.139 --> 42:55.042
Bill, you're a child,
you're an actual fucking child.

42:55.076 --> 42:56.944
You couldn't get your shit
together to even

42:56.977 --> 42:59.113
walk into a bank
let alone rob a bank.

42:59.146 --> 43:00.714
- I don't have my shit together?
- Uh-uh.

43:00.748 --> 43:03.350
You're homeless,
crazy and pregnant.

43:03.384 --> 43:05.686
Yes, Andy told me,
you're pregnant

43:05.719 --> 43:07.221
and we need to take
care of you and the baby.

43:07.254 --> 43:09.090
If we rob a bank
you have a good healthy baby.

43:09.123 --> 43:11.025
- Think about it.
- Stop talking about my baby.

43:11.058 --> 43:13.360
Okay, look,
I can talk about that child

43:13.394 --> 43:15.796
because I dreamt it, all right.

43:15.830 --> 43:17.798
I coerced sperm to egg
with my mind.

43:17.832 --> 43:19.767
I'm part of all this happening.

43:19.800 --> 43:22.169
I'm not insane, I'm not, I'm
not, I'm not insane for that.

43:22.203 --> 43:24.105
- Get out of my house!
- Oh my god.

43:24.138 --> 43:25.940
First off, it's not your house.

43:25.973 --> 43:27.308
It's your sisters, okay.

43:27.341 --> 43:28.843
And if she knew that
I was trying to help you

43:28.876 --> 43:30.744
get out of it she'd say,
"Bill, you stay.

43:30.778 --> 43:32.279
You make your plan,
get Bonnie out of your hair."

43:32.313 --> 43:34.748
Get out of my house
or I'm calling the cops.

43:34.782 --> 43:37.918
Look, I'm a quarter Cherokee.

43:37.952 --> 43:40.855
Listen, this land is mine.

43:40.888 --> 43:42.289
- Get out of my house.
- Oh my god.

43:42.323 --> 43:43.891
- You know I'll hit women right?
- Fine, hit me,

43:43.924 --> 43:46.427
fucking hit me
and see what happens.

43:46.460 --> 43:47.928
Just fucking hit me, Bill.

43:47.962 --> 43:49.797
- I... I... I
- Yeah, that's right

43:49.830 --> 43:51.365
- you're pathetic.
- I'm not pathetic.

43:51.398 --> 43:52.867
- I'm going to rob a bank.
- Leave Andy of out this.

43:52.900 --> 43:54.201
Get the fuck out
of my house, go.

43:54.235 --> 43:57.004
- Really?
- Yeah, you're a piece of shit.

43:57.037 --> 43:59.073
- You won't talk to me?
- You piece of shit idiot.

43:59.106 --> 44:00.141
Goddamn.

44:02.009 --> 44:05.079
Way to call a guy's bluff.

44:08.782 --> 44:11.986
Here we go.

44:12.019 --> 44:15.089
Yeah, that's it, that's her.

44:29.970 --> 44:31.338
Ugh, fuck.

44:31.372 --> 44:33.240
What's wrong?

44:33.274 --> 44:35.109
She's going to dump me,
I know it.

44:35.142 --> 44:37.378
No, dude, she's going
to forgive us in the morning.

44:37.411 --> 44:40.247
Look, what's important is that
we set a precedent in there.

44:40.281 --> 44:42.850
All right?
You don't mess with the boys.

44:42.883 --> 44:44.251
Ugh, it's fucking terrible.

44:44.285 --> 44:47.021
Dude, hey, hey, this dick?

44:47.054 --> 44:49.023
She's addicted to this dick,
all right.

44:49.056 --> 44:51.125
Come on,
let's just go get loaded.

44:51.158 --> 44:54.028
Let's take it to the next level,
An-Man.

44:54.061 --> 44:59.099
I'm talking Martian,
curtain call, lime rickey.

44:59.133 --> 45:01.202
Ready? Huh?

45:22.389 --> 45:24.892
We need a peaceful moment,
need a peaceful moment.

45:24.925 --> 45:26.427
All right, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

45:26.460 --> 45:28.295
- I'm sorry.
- Need a peaceful moment.

45:28.329 --> 45:30.030
Need to drink more.

45:30.064 --> 45:32.166
- Oh, fuck.
- I gotta do this.

45:32.199 --> 45:33.767
We got one left.

45:33.801 --> 45:36.036
Okay, wait,
I've always wanted to do this.

45:36.070 --> 45:37.539
You ready? Okay.

45:37.572 --> 45:40.140
Don't move, okay?

45:40.174 --> 45:42.476
Okay, you gotta stay still.

45:44.044 --> 45:45.246
Look.

45:47.114 --> 45:48.349
Open up.

45:50.317 --> 45:52.219
Holy shit, it's gonna work.

45:52.253 --> 45:54.021
It's gonna work, okay.

45:56.423 --> 45:58.125
Okay, it worked!

45:58.158 --> 45:59.561
We got it.

45:59.594 --> 46:01.428
We got liftoff.

46:02.963 --> 46:04.331
Is it fun?

46:04.365 --> 46:06.834
So delicious.

46:06.867 --> 46:09.203
You look like a little baby.

46:20.948 --> 46:22.249
Andy?

46:23.851 --> 46:25.152
Andy?

46:33.427 --> 46:35.062
Andy?

46:58.485 --> 47:00.254
An-man.

47:00.287 --> 47:01.422
Where you been, dude?

47:01.455 --> 47:02.256
Bonnie's.

47:02.289 --> 47:04.425
It's Bonnie's sister's, okay?

47:04.458 --> 47:06.493
Don't let her get up
on her high horse.

47:06.528 --> 47:08.028
She's a bag lady.

47:08.062 --> 47:10.297
Don't let her forget that,
all right?

47:10.331 --> 47:11.465
Dude, want another cigarette?

47:11.498 --> 47:12.534
Yeah.

47:14.536 --> 47:17.271
Here you go,
a little Martian milk for you.

47:18.305 --> 47:19.940
Thank you.

47:19.973 --> 47:22.142
You got a full pack, huh?

47:22.176 --> 47:23.511
Where'd you get that?

47:23.545 --> 47:25.079
That's not important.

47:25.112 --> 47:26.880
Let me tell you something.

47:26.914 --> 47:29.651
I got in a huge fight
with Bonnie about you.

47:29.684 --> 47:31.118
What do you mean? How so?

47:31.151 --> 47:33.354
So basically
she gave me a show...

47:33.387 --> 47:34.888
how do you say, showdown?

47:34.922 --> 47:35.956
Showdown.

47:35.989 --> 47:38.158
She gave me a showdown,
she's like,

47:38.192 --> 47:41.495
"Andy, it's you and me
or you with Bill."

47:41.529 --> 47:43.598
And then you just came
right over here?

47:45.065 --> 47:46.033
That's fuckin' awesome, dude.

47:46.066 --> 47:48.536
I'd have given anything
to see her expression.

47:48.570 --> 47:51.573
Was she just like,
"Oh, Andy, please stay with me?

47:51.606 --> 47:53.907
I'm so sorry.
I love you, Andy.

47:53.941 --> 47:55.042
I made a mistake."

47:56.110 --> 47:57.545
Fuck, Bill, I have to move out.

47:57.579 --> 47:59.079
Wait, she said that or...

47:59.113 --> 48:00.314
No, I decide to move out.

48:00.347 --> 48:02.182
No, fuck that, dude,
that's bullshit.

48:02.216 --> 48:03.384
You know that's bullshit.

48:03.417 --> 48:04.652
Don't move out of here.

48:04.686 --> 48:05.520
No, dude.

48:05.553 --> 48:08.122
That's not...
This is your home, man.

48:08.155 --> 48:09.957
- I'm in love.
- I know you're in love,

48:09.990 --> 48:12.126
but that doesn't preclude me
from being part of it.

48:12.159 --> 48:14.228
I'm part of it,
and I've talked to her about it.

48:14.261 --> 48:15.229
But you're not part of this.

48:15.262 --> 48:17.197
She doesn't want you
being a part of this.

48:17.231 --> 48:19.099
That's just 'cause
I fought with her, man.

48:19.133 --> 48:21.001
I'm serious, dude,
I can get her some flowers,

48:21.034 --> 48:23.404
bring some roses to her,
I can make things up to her.

48:23.437 --> 48:25.072
Dude, that's not a good idea.

48:25.105 --> 48:26.940
That's a bad idea.
Don't do that.

48:26.974 --> 48:29.376
Okay, look, look, look,
then what about this?

48:29.410 --> 48:31.078
Okay, look,

48:31.111 --> 48:32.547
how about this?

48:32.580 --> 48:35.349
We'll drink these drinks,
we'll rest our big brains,

48:35.382 --> 48:37.351
and we come up
with a new plan, okay?

48:37.384 --> 48:40.053
And we get you a new woman,
one who loves you even more

48:40.087 --> 48:41.221
and one who likes me,
all right?

48:41.255 --> 48:43.390
That's what we do,
that's all we gotta do, man.

48:43.424 --> 48:45.560
- I'm late.
- Seriously, late for Bonnie?

48:45.593 --> 48:48.328
- Fuck Bonnie, dude.
- Dude, with Bonnie, I feel sane.

48:48.362 --> 48:50.264
With you, when you're here,
I feel insane.

48:50.297 --> 48:52.499
- I want to be sane.
- I get it, okay, fine, fine,

48:52.534 --> 48:53.768
but she's not making you sane,
dude.

48:53.802 --> 48:56.504
Look at you, she's making you
into some kind of goofball.

48:56.538 --> 48:59.139
You're fucking dressed like
a little chocolate bunny.

48:59.173 --> 49:01.175
- It's fucking ridiculous.
- Dude,

49:01.208 --> 49:04.278
Bonnie put a lot
of strong in me.

49:04.311 --> 49:05.680
Dude, that doesn't even
make sense in English.

49:05.713 --> 49:07.549
- It makes sense to me.
- Well, it doesn't make sense

49:07.582 --> 49:08.550
to the rest of America.

49:08.583 --> 49:09.416
- Bill.
- What?

49:09.450 --> 49:11.285
I have to go, I really...

49:11.318 --> 49:13.053
- Bonnie's waiting for me.
- No, you don't have to go.

49:13.086 --> 49:15.322
This is our place, we're gonna
hang out here a little bit.

49:15.355 --> 49:16.990
All right?
Sit the fuck down.

49:17.024 --> 49:18.593
Dude, you put me
in this situation all this...

49:18.626 --> 49:21.161
- How the fuck did I...
- ...to try to steal her stuff,

49:21.195 --> 49:23.197
- all this bank robbery stuff.
- Bullshit, that was your...

49:23.230 --> 49:25.232
You wanted to rob
a bank, too, dude.

49:25.265 --> 49:27.769
I just talked to her about it.
Sorry for being fucking honest.

49:27.802 --> 49:28.803
- Okay?
- I'm late.

49:28.837 --> 49:30.772
- Stop it, stop it!
- Dude, I don't like this.

49:30.805 --> 49:32.372
- You don't like what?
- I'm late.

49:32.406 --> 49:34.241
You don't like what,
motherfucker, huh?

49:34.274 --> 49:35.275
Go, get the fuck outta here.

49:35.309 --> 49:36.410
I don't even fucking want
to be around you.

49:36.443 --> 49:39.046
- Dude, I don't like this.
- You don't like this?

49:39.079 --> 49:40.380
I don't like this either.

49:40.414 --> 49:41.649
- So goodbye.
- Okay, fine.

49:41.683 --> 49:43.217
Look at you, Mr. Cool.

49:43.250 --> 49:44.485
Fight me, you fuck.

49:44.519 --> 49:47.054
Come on, fight me, fight me!

49:48.088 --> 49:50.023
Motherfucker. Motherfucker.

49:51.058 --> 49:52.292
Calm down.

49:52.326 --> 49:54.127
Calm down. Calm down.

50:04.104 --> 50:06.373
Where the fuck do you think
you're going?

50:08.208 --> 50:09.176
Huh?

50:09.209 --> 50:11.078
Let me go, let me go.

50:11.111 --> 50:12.446
Let me go, okay? Let me go.

50:13.648 --> 50:14.716
Fuck you.

50:17.351 --> 50:18.485
Don't go, dude.

50:18.520 --> 50:20.220
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

50:20.254 --> 50:21.388
Dude, I'm nothing without you.

50:21.421 --> 50:23.825
Dude, I don't want to hurt you.

50:23.858 --> 50:25.359
Just don't go, I'm sorry.

50:25.392 --> 50:27.227
- No, dude...
- I'm sorry, dude.

50:27.261 --> 50:28.395
- I'm sorry.
- It's the last chance.

50:28.428 --> 50:29.764
I just don't know what to do.

50:29.797 --> 50:31.666
- Let me go, okay?
- I just don't know what to do.

50:31.699 --> 50:34.234
- I don't want to hurt you.
- I don't know what to do.

50:34.268 --> 50:35.469
- I don't know...
- Let me go.

50:50.350 --> 50:52.319
Come on.

50:55.289 --> 50:58.826
Think I'm a bad fucking
family member, huh?

50:58.860 --> 51:00.762
Think I'm
a bad family member, Bonnie?

51:00.795 --> 51:02.429
Oh, what's in the bag?

51:02.462 --> 51:05.098
Two hundred thousand dollars
cash for you

51:05.132 --> 51:06.166
and your unborn baby.

51:06.199 --> 51:08.636
No, no, no, no,
I won't take any, I don't...

51:28.656 --> 51:30.290
Sir?

51:30.324 --> 51:32.392
Can I help you?

51:32.426 --> 51:34.394
I don't know,
is your name Benedict Arnold?

51:34.428 --> 51:35.697
Excuse me?

51:37.364 --> 51:38.800
You ever wanna get
in there, huh?

51:38.833 --> 51:41.335
- You wanna get in here?
- You ever wanna get in there?

51:41.368 --> 51:43.203
Yeah, I work here.

51:43.236 --> 51:44.471
It's your lucky day, cabrón.

51:44.505 --> 51:46.340
What do you mean,
it's my lucky day?

51:46.373 --> 51:47.742
It's a two-man job.

51:49.711 --> 51:51.144
It's a two-man job.

51:51.178 --> 51:53.380
Two-man job? Okay.

52:06.561 --> 52:08.295
Anybody home?

52:08.328 --> 52:09.764
Huh, anybody home?

52:11.532 --> 52:14.368
All right, how about this?

52:14.401 --> 52:15.637
Little music?

52:15.670 --> 52:17.538
Little bit of dance, huh?

52:18.673 --> 52:19.907
You wanna dance with Bill?

52:19.941 --> 52:21.274
Come on.

52:21.308 --> 52:22.844
I'm having fun out here!

52:22.877 --> 52:24.478
I'm having a blast!

52:24.512 --> 52:27.247
Come on, motherfuckers!

52:27.280 --> 52:28.683
Okay.

52:28.716 --> 52:30.250
No dancing, huh?

52:31.451 --> 52:33.955
Where'd you get this,
from little Grammy Fanny, huh?

52:33.988 --> 52:35.623
Little Grammy Fanny?

52:38.793 --> 52:41.896
I'm just gonna take a piss
out here, all right?

52:41.929 --> 52:43.430
Here I go.

52:43.463 --> 52:45.232
- I'm going.
- Bill, don't pee in there.

52:45.265 --> 52:46.500
It's a bluff, it's a bluff.

52:46.534 --> 52:47.702
You think I don't know
the rules?

52:47.735 --> 52:50.571
Get Bonnie out here, we need
a family meeting right now!

52:50.605 --> 52:52.372
- We're not a family.
- Time to talk bank robbery.

52:52.406 --> 52:53.508
We are not a family, Bill.

52:53.541 --> 52:54.742
- Oh, no?
- Yeah, we're not.

52:54.776 --> 52:56.309
Okay, so she's already
out here, huh?

52:56.343 --> 52:58.245
She tucked in your cheek,
or has she got a string

52:58.278 --> 52:59.847
tied around your prick
and she's tugging on that?

52:59.881 --> 53:02.583
- Why'd you even come here?
- I came here because I love you

53:02.617 --> 53:04.919
and we have a really fucking
important bank robbery to do.

53:04.952 --> 53:06.386
If you love me,
you'll leave me alone.

53:06.420 --> 53:07.454
That doesn't make sense.

53:07.487 --> 53:09.456
If you love someone,
you want to be around them.

53:09.489 --> 53:11.626
- That's the whole fucking point.
- I'm finally in love.

53:11.659 --> 53:13.460
You keep saying "love"

53:13.493 --> 53:15.596
so many fucking times,
it's lost all meaning.

53:15.630 --> 53:16.698
You love, love, love.

53:16.731 --> 53:17.832
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah?

53:17.865 --> 53:19.266
But I'm a part of it, Andy.

53:19.299 --> 53:20.434
I'm a fucking part of it.

53:20.467 --> 53:22.235
You're not gonna be
a part of this.

53:22.269 --> 53:23.971
Yes, I am, okay?

53:24.005 --> 53:26.908
I don't care what you think
or what you're thinking now

53:26.941 --> 53:28.341
or what you thought.

53:28.375 --> 53:29.644
Open your heart to me.

53:29.677 --> 53:32.345
Open your fucking heart to me
like we promised

53:32.379 --> 53:33.815
and talked about, Mommy.

53:33.848 --> 53:34.982
- Do you remember?
- You're insane.

53:35.016 --> 53:35.950
I called the cops.

53:35.983 --> 53:38.251
Good, me and the boys in blue
go way back.

53:38.285 --> 53:39.721
I can't wait
for a little reunion.

53:39.754 --> 53:41.689
Bring 'em on, bring 'em on,
let's see what happens.

53:41.723 --> 53:42.824
- Bill, Bill, Bill...
- Bullets!

53:42.857 --> 53:44.491
Bill, just leave,
don't go to jail.

53:44.525 --> 53:46.426
I'm not going to jail,
I didn't do anything.

53:46.460 --> 53:48.428
Look at that,
you're breaking and entering!

53:48.462 --> 53:50.464
- You also assault me.
- Assault?

53:50.497 --> 53:52.332
You ever think maybe
I'm trying to just open up

53:52.365 --> 53:54.267
a fucking third eye
on your head, huh, huh?

53:54.301 --> 53:56.336
- You think that maybe, huh?
- Hey, stop.

53:56.369 --> 53:58.539
- She needs to see God again.
- Don't point your finger at me.

53:58.573 --> 53:59.841
She needs a place
where she can see God.

53:59.874 --> 54:02.342
This is the kind of insane talk
that I don't want to be around.

54:02.375 --> 54:04.344
That's the kind of talk you need
'cause you need to see God

54:04.377 --> 54:05.880
and you've been thinking it
since I met you.

54:05.913 --> 54:07.582
I can see it
in your fucking eyes,

54:07.615 --> 54:09.282
there's no God here.

54:09.316 --> 54:10.618
- What?
- You leave.

54:10.651 --> 54:12.019
- I leave?
- Yeah, you showed who you are

54:12.053 --> 54:13.755
you made her upset,
I don't want...

54:13.788 --> 54:16.456
Oh, look at you,
Mr. Fucking Calm, huh?

54:16.490 --> 54:18.325
You remember who used
to pet your head, huh,

54:18.358 --> 54:20.327
when you were all suicidal
and crying?

54:20.360 --> 54:21.963
- Who did that?
- It's not like that anymore.

54:21.996 --> 54:23.497
- It's not, no?
- It's not like that anymore.

54:23.531 --> 54:25.499
Yeah, 'cause you get one sip
of the golden cup,

54:25.533 --> 54:27.602
and all of a sudden,
you have everything figured out.

54:27.635 --> 54:29.904
And I'm the fucking fool,
and I'm the fucking idiot?

54:29.937 --> 54:31.806
- Stop babble at us...
- Babble?

54:31.839 --> 54:34.307
Rhapsody, motherfucker.
That's rhapsody.

54:34.341 --> 54:35.576
- Stop! Bill, stop.
- Listen,

54:35.610 --> 54:37.444
you really want me
to fucking leave, huh?

54:37.477 --> 54:38.579
- Yup.
- You want me to leave?

54:38.613 --> 54:39.747
- Yeah, do you?
- Please leave.

54:39.781 --> 54:41.783
Okay, look me in the eyes,
tell me you don't love me.

54:41.816 --> 54:42.850
- I don't love you.
- Okay, fine.

54:42.884 --> 54:44.986
- Tell me you fucking hate me
- I fucking hate you.

54:45.019 --> 54:47.088
Fine. What the fuck's
the point of life, huh?

54:47.121 --> 54:48.923
What's the point of any of this?
No love?

54:48.956 --> 54:50.558
- Just leave, okay? Just leave.
- Fucking nightmare.

54:50.591 --> 54:51.859
You're living
in a fucking nightmare,

54:51.893 --> 54:53.594
and I don't want
to go in there.

54:53.628 --> 54:54.829
Fuck this, Andy.

54:54.862 --> 54:57.098
You're gonna come crying
back to me!

54:57.131 --> 54:59.100
I'm going to fucking Jupiter!

57:42.029 --> 57:43.764
Okay.

57:43.798 --> 57:46.968
So now, I want you
to shut your eyes

57:47.001 --> 57:51.272
and think of a shape and color
that you feel defines you.

57:51.305 --> 57:53.207
We're going to go
around the circle,

57:53.240 --> 57:55.977
and once everyone's had
a chance to speak,

57:56.010 --> 57:59.714
we're going to discuss
what each of us said.

57:59.747 --> 58:01.182
Ollie?

58:01.215 --> 58:02.984
You go first.

58:09.957 --> 58:12.626
An orange square,

58:12.660 --> 58:14.061
like my hairs.

58:14.095 --> 58:16.063
Great.

58:16.097 --> 58:17.765
Now you, Tim.

58:22.703 --> 58:24.205
Uh, an egg.

58:24.238 --> 58:26.207
What color?

58:26.240 --> 58:28.209
Just an ordinary egg.

58:28.242 --> 58:30.578
Okay.

58:30.611 --> 58:32.880
- Now you, William.
- Bill.

58:32.913 --> 58:35.950
- Okay, Bill.
- Beautiful Bill.

58:35.983 --> 58:37.284
And what do you see?

58:41.188 --> 58:42.690
A black arrow.

58:59.306 --> 59:00.341
What?

59:00.374 --> 59:01.876
What do you want?

59:12.386 --> 59:14.188
No, no.

59:14.221 --> 59:15.923
No, uh-uh.

59:17.058 --> 59:18.659
You gotta get up in there.

59:18.692 --> 59:19.927
You gotta get deeper.

59:19.960 --> 59:21.328
There's little hairs
up in here.

59:21.362 --> 59:22.863
No, which part?

59:22.897 --> 59:24.765
Oh, God, here,
just let me do it,

59:24.799 --> 59:26.801
let me do it.

59:26.834 --> 59:28.602
So the asshole split
on you, huh?

59:28.636 --> 59:29.703
Yup.

59:29.737 --> 59:30.704
What happened?

59:30.738 --> 59:31.972
I'm not a good partner.

59:32.006 --> 59:34.041
Dude, you're the best partner.

59:34.075 --> 59:36.277
No, as a partner in romance.

59:36.310 --> 59:39.280
I got fired from so many jobs.

59:39.313 --> 59:41.215
Bonnie and I were.

59:41.248 --> 59:42.283
No, she left.

59:42.316 --> 59:43.717
How long you been solo?

59:43.751 --> 59:46.187
Six months.

59:46.220 --> 59:48.155
Tale as old as time, brother.

59:48.189 --> 59:51.725
A man/woman situation
is tenuous at best.

59:51.759 --> 59:53.727
So you know what
you gotta do now, right?

59:53.761 --> 59:55.062
Yeah, get her back.

59:57.298 --> 59:58.099
Bill!

59:58.132 --> 59:59.867
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

59:59.900 --> 1:00:01.402
Dude, Bill...

1:00:01.435 --> 1:00:02.303
I'm sorry, but, here.

1:00:02.336 --> 1:00:04.705
We're not gonna get
her back, okay?

1:00:04.738 --> 1:00:06.841
Your kid, we gotta get
your kid, okay?

1:00:06.874 --> 1:00:09.143
We're gonna...
we're gonna kidnap your son.

1:00:09.176 --> 1:00:12.646
Okay? That's all that matters
right now, all right?

1:00:12.680 --> 1:00:14.381
- What's his name?
- George.

1:00:16.083 --> 1:00:17.918
- Dude.
- What?

1:00:17.952 --> 1:00:21.155
Zechariah,
the firstborn is Zechariah.

1:00:21.188 --> 1:00:23.757
Whatever, we'll change his name
when we get him back.

1:00:23.791 --> 1:00:25.326
First we just gotta get me
outta here.

1:00:25.359 --> 1:00:26.760
- Bill, Bill.
- What?

1:00:26.794 --> 1:00:28.395
Are you okay?
Are you sane?

1:00:28.429 --> 1:00:31.799
I still... I just... I have like
this new kind of humming,

1:00:31.832 --> 1:00:35.369
like an e... it's like an ext...
like an internal/external energy

1:00:35.402 --> 1:00:37.671
that's just like pulsing in me
and it's making me stronger,

1:00:37.705 --> 1:00:39.373
but I'm fucking crazy,
I am fucking crazy,

1:00:39.406 --> 1:00:41.909
but I feel like if I could have
you and your son,

1:00:41.942 --> 1:00:43.110
you'll keep me sane, right?

1:00:43.144 --> 1:00:44.111
Yeah.

1:00:44.145 --> 1:00:46.147
- Really?
- Yeah, of course.

1:00:46.180 --> 1:00:47.414
You're still my best friend?

1:00:47.448 --> 1:00:49.683
Always best friend.

1:00:49.717 --> 1:00:52.019
- Then we just gotta get me out.
- Yeah.

1:00:52.052 --> 1:00:55.089
My opinion of myself right now
is just like off the charts.

1:00:55.122 --> 1:00:57.691
Like it's very, very, very high.

1:00:57.725 --> 1:00:59.393
"Very, very, very..."

1:00:59.426 --> 1:01:00.828
Three verys.

1:01:00.861 --> 1:01:02.229
"Very high."

1:01:02.263 --> 1:01:03.998
Do you think that's the problem?

1:01:04.031 --> 1:01:06.400
I don't know,
how would you define "problem"

1:01:06.433 --> 1:01:08.135
in that context?

1:01:08.169 --> 1:01:10.437
Well, you know,
when you're manic,

1:01:10.471 --> 1:01:12.740
you tend to self-aggrandize
quite a bit.

1:01:12.773 --> 1:01:14.175
Well, that's in the past, right?

1:01:14.208 --> 1:01:16.043
Like, when I say it now,

1:01:16.076 --> 1:01:18.412
I mean like,
a solid B+ gentleman.

1:01:18.445 --> 1:01:21.782
Like I'm just feeling like
a good, regular guy

1:01:21.815 --> 1:01:23.350
looking to live
a good, regular life

1:01:23.384 --> 1:01:25.753
in that old good, regular world,
you know?

1:01:25.786 --> 1:01:28.455
And, uh, honestly, doc,
it's like,

1:01:28.489 --> 1:01:31.091
when you think about it,
I've been in here four years

1:01:31.125 --> 1:01:34.929
for one night of Wolfman,
and you and I both know

1:01:34.962 --> 1:01:37.064
it's time for me
to be unleashed, you know?

1:01:37.097 --> 1:01:40.901
Are you sure you want that,
you know, and the regular life?

1:01:40.935 --> 1:01:43.404
You talk about monotony
all the time.

1:01:43.437 --> 1:01:45.339
Yeah, but, I mean,
I realize like

1:01:45.372 --> 1:01:47.441
the quote-unquote
"regular world,"

1:01:47.474 --> 1:01:50.110
that's where
the uncharted terrain is

1:01:50.144 --> 1:01:53.380
and where I think I can
accomplish my life goals

1:01:53.414 --> 1:01:56.483
and contribute to society
in that healthy way.

1:01:56.518 --> 1:01:57.985
- Do you know what I mean?
- Mm-hmm.

1:01:58.018 --> 1:01:59.186
- You understand?
- Yeah.

1:01:59.220 --> 1:02:00.421
I'm ready for it, sir.

1:02:00.454 --> 1:02:02.489
- Are you, Bill?
- Hundred percent.

1:02:02.524 --> 1:02:04.258
I have no doubts.

1:02:06.026 --> 1:02:07.394
I don't know.

1:02:57.411 --> 1:02:59.013
So you're living
in here, dude?

1:02:59.046 --> 1:03:01.248
- Yeah, terrible.
- Yeah?

1:03:01.282 --> 1:03:02.983
Well, it's good, dude.

1:03:03.017 --> 1:03:03.884
It's a good thing.

1:03:03.917 --> 1:03:06.487
Living in your car is cool,
all right?

1:03:06.521 --> 1:03:08.022
Where's Bonnie at?

1:03:08.055 --> 1:03:10.024
Bonnie moved in
with her new boyfriend,

1:03:10.057 --> 1:03:10.991
into his mansion.

1:03:11.025 --> 1:03:13.360
- What do you mean, a mansion?
- A mansion.

1:03:13.394 --> 1:03:14.828
Oh, fuck, dude.

1:03:14.862 --> 1:03:16.297
I'm sorry, but with a mansion?

1:03:16.330 --> 1:03:17.364
You're kinda fucked, man.

1:03:17.398 --> 1:03:20.501
He's got statues everywhere,
fucking topiary,

1:03:20.535 --> 1:03:22.870
all that gilding.

1:03:22.903 --> 1:03:25.072
People get entranced
by that shit, dude.

1:03:25.105 --> 1:03:26.473
It was terrible.

1:03:26.508 --> 1:03:28.576
- So you've been there?
- Yeah, four times.

1:03:28.610 --> 1:03:31.579
Yeah, what, did they sit you
down for some big, weepy talk?

1:03:31.613 --> 1:03:33.380
"Oh, Andy, we're in love now.

1:03:33.414 --> 1:03:35.115
I'm so sorry, Andy.

1:03:35.149 --> 1:03:36.850
It's our time for love."

1:03:36.884 --> 1:03:39.186
- Oh, stop, stop.
- They do that?

1:03:39.219 --> 1:03:41.889
Yeah, they also fucking kissed
a couple of times.

1:03:41.922 --> 1:03:43.424
Jesus fucking Christ,
what'd you do?

1:03:43.457 --> 1:03:45.993
I tried to burn
that motherfucking place down.

1:03:46.026 --> 1:03:47.227
That's my man.

1:03:47.261 --> 1:03:48.162
Well, when you were there,

1:03:48.195 --> 1:03:50.030
you weren't just getting
a big, weepy talk.

1:03:50.064 --> 1:03:51.498
You know what else
you were doing?

1:03:51.533 --> 1:03:53.334
- Do you?
- What, what?

1:03:53.367 --> 1:03:55.869
You were doing reconnaissance.

1:04:03.578 --> 1:04:06.614
I just gotta visit
my sleepy buddy here real quick.

1:04:06.648 --> 1:04:07.981
Think he'll, uh...

1:04:09.016 --> 1:04:10.284
...hook us up.

1:04:13.487 --> 1:04:14.955
All right.

1:04:21.395 --> 1:04:23.097
Keep the car running, okay?

1:04:23.130 --> 1:04:25.165
Hey, don't be so sad, all right?

1:04:25.199 --> 1:04:27.267
We're getting your son.

1:04:45.986 --> 1:04:47.388
Oh, what's going on?

1:04:47.421 --> 1:04:49.156
Hey, what's up?

1:04:49.189 --> 1:04:52.126
Um, I'm Douglas Peterson,
I'm friends with Randall.

1:04:52.159 --> 1:04:53.460
Oh, Randall's asleep.

1:04:53.494 --> 1:04:56.063
Yeah, of course he is.

1:04:56.096 --> 1:04:57.998
Uh, I got something
to drop off for him.

1:04:58.031 --> 1:04:59.634
- You mind if I head up?
- Go for it.

1:05:35.603 --> 1:05:38.038
Early bird strikes again.

1:05:44.779 --> 1:05:47.147
Thanks for the worms,
you lazy bastard.

1:06:20.615 --> 1:06:21.783
See?

1:06:21.816 --> 1:06:23.651
Yup.

1:06:23.685 --> 1:06:25.620
You look like a fucking monster.

1:06:25.653 --> 1:06:27.354
- Fuck.
- Terrifying people,

1:06:27.387 --> 1:06:29.757
and then you're like...
hey, you're like...

1:06:29.791 --> 1:06:32.359
Here, here, dude,
are you doing it right?

1:06:36.463 --> 1:06:38.298
Dude, don't be a baby.

1:06:38.332 --> 1:06:39.299
No, don't, that's...

1:06:39.333 --> 1:06:41.034
Wait, wait, stop, stop, stop.

1:06:41.068 --> 1:06:44.137
Dude, it's your hair bristles,
they're like Velcro.

1:06:44.171 --> 1:06:45.372
Chill out.

1:06:47.441 --> 1:06:49.276
Dude, I don't think...
this isn't going on.

1:06:49.309 --> 1:06:50.277
No, no, no.

1:06:55.215 --> 1:06:56.250
Let's do this.

1:06:56.283 --> 1:06:57.785
- Ready?
- Yeah.

1:06:57.819 --> 1:06:59.821
Okay, okay, look at me.

1:06:59.854 --> 1:07:01.388
- You're gonna be brave?
- Yeah.

1:07:01.421 --> 1:07:03.390
How brave do you think
I'm gonna be?

1:07:03.423 --> 1:07:05.058
Super, super fucking brave.

1:07:05.092 --> 1:07:05.793
- George.
- George.

1:07:05.827 --> 1:07:06.761
- Family.
- Family.

1:07:06.794 --> 1:07:07.695
- George.
- George.

1:07:07.729 --> 1:07:08.563
- Family.
- Family.

1:07:08.596 --> 1:07:09.463
- George.
- George.

1:07:09.496 --> 1:07:10.532
- Family.
- Family.

1:07:12.366 --> 1:07:13.500
Let's go!

1:07:31.519 --> 1:07:32.486
Fuck.

1:07:35.590 --> 1:07:37.090
It's locked.

1:07:43.230 --> 1:07:44.398
Yes, yes, yes.

1:07:44.431 --> 1:07:45.733
Go, go, go, go.

1:08:23.270 --> 1:08:25.172
- Mama?
- Hey, hey, hey.

1:08:25.205 --> 1:08:26.674
Come on. Yeah, come on.

1:08:41.656 --> 1:08:42.757
Go, go, go, go.

1:08:47.227 --> 1:08:48.395
George.

1:08:48.428 --> 1:08:49.429
Hey.

1:08:49.463 --> 1:08:51.264
Come with me, come with me.

1:08:51.298 --> 1:08:52.332
Hey, little boy.

1:08:52.366 --> 1:08:55.637
Do you remember me
from when I dreamed about you?

1:08:57.371 --> 1:08:59.272
Let's go.

1:09:08.783 --> 1:09:10.885
Who's the rock star?

1:09:25.933 --> 1:09:28.736
You're more fun than adults.
I hate adults.

1:09:28.770 --> 1:09:30.972
- Adults are the worst.
- I'm saving the snake.

1:09:31.005 --> 1:09:32.272
- Bill.
- What?

1:09:32.305 --> 1:09:33.508
Don't make him feel this way.

1:09:33.541 --> 1:09:34.842
George, come over here.

1:09:34.876 --> 1:09:36.243
Brush your teeth.

1:09:36.276 --> 1:09:37.244
Come.

1:09:40.948 --> 1:09:42.215
What was that?

1:09:47.454 --> 1:09:49.289
Come here, I think it's Sam.

1:09:50.958 --> 1:09:51.926
Sam?

1:09:51.959 --> 1:09:53.460
Fuck, that's him.

1:09:53.493 --> 1:09:55.897
It's fucked now.

1:09:55.930 --> 1:09:57.699
All right, here's what we do.

1:09:57.732 --> 1:09:59.266
- What?
- Listen, listen,

1:09:59.299 --> 1:10:01.334
just stay totally quiet,
stay totally quiet.

1:10:01.368 --> 1:10:02.070
- Okay.
- Okay?

1:10:02.103 --> 1:10:03.571
I'm just gonna wait out here,

1:10:03.604 --> 1:10:05.907
so whenever you're ready
to talk, let me know.

1:10:05.940 --> 1:10:07.842
- I got cigarettes.
- Cigarettes!

1:10:07.875 --> 1:10:09.510
What do we do?

1:10:09.544 --> 1:10:12.279
- You know what I say, Andy?
- You say shit all the time.

1:10:12.312 --> 1:10:15.382
I say if you see a snake
in the woods, gobble it up.

1:10:15.415 --> 1:10:17.484
Put that kid in the bathroom.

1:10:18.753 --> 1:10:20.353
Go, go, go, stay inside.

1:10:20.387 --> 1:10:23.423
Your uncle Bill and Daddy
need to fight a monster.

1:10:23.457 --> 1:10:25.893
You want me to go
in the bathroom?

1:10:34.736 --> 1:10:36.269
- Hey.
- Bill?

1:10:36.303 --> 1:10:38.539
Yeah, Beautiful Bill.
Come on in, come on in, dude.

1:10:39.574 --> 1:10:40.407
Turn the fuck around.

1:10:40.440 --> 1:10:42.043
Put your hands
behind your back, now.

1:10:42.076 --> 1:10:43.376
Put your hands
behind your back.

1:10:43.410 --> 1:10:44.444
Why are you doing this?
I just...

1:10:44.478 --> 1:10:46.013
- I'm doing this because...
- There's no tr...

1:10:46.047 --> 1:10:48.583
I don't know who...
hey, buddy, buddy, buddy.

1:10:48.616 --> 1:10:51.586
I don't know who the fuck
you are, all right?

1:10:51.619 --> 1:10:52.787
Put your wrists together.

1:10:52.820 --> 1:10:53.921
Put them together.

1:10:53.955 --> 1:10:55.590
I...

1:10:55.623 --> 1:10:57.424
- There you go.
- I just wanted to talk

1:10:57.457 --> 1:10:58.325
to you guys.

1:10:58.358 --> 1:11:00.061
Never been fucking
tied up before, huh?

1:11:00.094 --> 1:11:00.928
No.

1:11:00.962 --> 1:11:02.797
Well, first time
for everything, bud.

1:11:02.830 --> 1:11:03.931
Turn the fuck around.

1:11:04.966 --> 1:11:06.534
Huh, huh, huh?

1:11:06.567 --> 1:11:07.602
Look at me.

1:11:07.635 --> 1:11:09.070
What are you doing here?

1:11:09.103 --> 1:11:11.005
- I just wanted to talk...
- What the fuck is this?

1:11:11.038 --> 1:11:13.306
It's whiskey 'cause I wanted
to have a drink with you guys.

1:11:13.340 --> 1:11:14.407
No, that's poison,
all right?

1:11:14.441 --> 1:11:15.543
We're not drinking your poison,

1:11:15.576 --> 1:11:18.012
and I'm not falling
for your fucking tricks, okay?

1:11:18.045 --> 1:11:19.847
- What's going on?
- I know that

1:11:19.881 --> 1:11:21.314
you took George, all right?

1:11:21.348 --> 1:11:22.817
Bullshit, that did not happen.

1:11:22.850 --> 1:11:23.951
We did not take George.

1:11:23.985 --> 1:11:25.553
I don't even know who that is.

1:11:26.988 --> 1:11:28.823
I know you took him,
and I understand.

1:11:28.856 --> 1:11:30.423
If I was in your position,

1:11:30.457 --> 1:11:32.760
I'd probably do the same thing,
okay?

1:11:32.794 --> 1:11:34.394
What do you mean?
What are you talking about?

1:11:34.427 --> 1:11:35.863
If you will just listen to me.

1:11:35.897 --> 1:11:38.032
I basically just wanted
to kind of lay things out

1:11:38.065 --> 1:11:40.500
from a different perspective
and have a rational conversation

1:11:40.535 --> 1:11:41.602
without this shit going on.

1:11:41.636 --> 1:11:42.770
What, this shit?

1:11:42.804 --> 1:11:44.005
This isn't a boardroom, okay?

1:11:44.038 --> 1:11:45.640
We're not a couple
of your investors,

1:11:45.673 --> 1:11:46.741
and we're not gonna watch

1:11:46.774 --> 1:11:47.942
a friffin'
PowerPoint presentation

1:11:47.975 --> 1:11:50.343
on how you're some kind
of man of the hour, get that?

1:11:50.377 --> 1:11:51.579
I'm not trying to talk
like that,

1:11:51.612 --> 1:11:53.480
- I'm not trying to sound...
- You are talking like that,

1:11:53.514 --> 1:11:54.916
you're sounding like
a fucking fake.

1:11:54.949 --> 1:11:55.983
- Okay...
- Do you get it?

1:11:56.017 --> 1:11:57.417
I'm not trying to sound phony.

1:11:57.450 --> 1:11:58.318
I'm sorry, I'm just nervous.

1:11:58.351 --> 1:12:00.021
What do you expect with
a gun in my face?

1:12:00.054 --> 1:12:01.622
What do I expect?
I expect behavior.

1:12:01.656 --> 1:12:02.757
I expect compliance.

1:12:02.790 --> 1:12:04.058
Andy, you can vouch for me.

1:12:04.091 --> 1:12:05.358
I don't know you.

1:12:05.392 --> 1:12:06.727
We know each other a little bit.

1:12:06.761 --> 1:12:08.062
Now you think I'm important?

1:12:08.095 --> 1:12:09.797
Now you're asking me for help?

1:12:09.831 --> 1:12:10.898
You ruined my life.

1:12:10.932 --> 1:12:12.399
You ruined his fucking life.

1:12:12.432 --> 1:12:13.868
Look, you know me...
you know me a little bit...

1:12:13.901 --> 1:12:15.570
- I don't know you.
- It's nothing personal.

1:12:15.603 --> 1:12:17.470
No, no, Andy does,
and you, I know...

1:12:17.505 --> 1:12:18.940
I know about you
from stories.

1:12:18.973 --> 1:12:21.008
Yeah? What kinda stories?
Horror stories?

1:12:21.042 --> 1:12:23.443
And now you walked into one,
ding-dong.

1:12:23.476 --> 1:12:25.478
You don't need to do this,
all I wanted to do

1:12:25.513 --> 1:12:27.582
was just come here and show you
I'm a good, honest person.

1:12:27.615 --> 1:12:30.017
That's, you know, we're gonna be
the judge of who you are.

1:12:30.051 --> 1:12:31.786
Sam, where'd you get
all your money?

1:12:31.819 --> 1:12:33.721
Why you are so rich?
Where's your money from?

1:12:33.754 --> 1:12:34.822
Where's your fucking money from?

1:12:34.856 --> 1:12:36.423
From... just from tech.

1:12:36.456 --> 1:12:37.792
Technology, technology.

1:12:37.825 --> 1:12:38.926
That's fucking boring.

1:12:38.960 --> 1:12:40.928
Fine, it's boring,
but you know, it doesn't matter

1:12:40.962 --> 1:12:43.130
'cause there's two things
that can happen now, all right?

1:12:43.164 --> 1:12:45.465
One, the cops can get involved
if you guys keep this up

1:12:45.498 --> 1:12:48.135
and Bonnie flips out and then
you never see George again,

1:12:48.169 --> 1:12:50.104
but there's the other option,
if you listen to me,

1:12:50.137 --> 1:12:52.173
where you give me George
and I put him back in bed,

1:12:52.206 --> 1:12:54.508
I get him home real quick
before Bonnie knows anything,

1:12:54.542 --> 1:12:56.177
and we can forget
any of this ever happened.

1:12:56.210 --> 1:12:58.546
All right, and then I'll talk to
Bonnie and I'll reason with her

1:12:58.579 --> 1:13:02.016
and I'll make sure you guys
are a part of George's life.

1:13:04.451 --> 1:13:06.854
Or, how about this,
what about this option?

1:13:06.888 --> 1:13:09.523
What do you say to me just
blowing your cock off right now?

1:13:09.557 --> 1:13:11.125
What would you say to that?

1:13:11.158 --> 1:13:12.693
- Don't.
- Don't?

1:13:13.995 --> 1:13:15.563
Sam, I actually like that.

1:13:15.596 --> 1:13:17.932
Succinct, smart.

1:13:17.965 --> 1:13:19.667
You know, if you say
enough things I like,

1:13:19.700 --> 1:13:20.801
guess what happens then.

1:13:20.835 --> 1:13:22.036
What?

1:13:22.069 --> 1:13:24.205
- Could end up liking ya.
- Great, I'd like that.

1:13:24.238 --> 1:13:26.473
You would? Why?

1:13:26.507 --> 1:13:27.541
Because I like you!

1:13:27.575 --> 1:13:29.510
You don't like me,
you don't fucking know me!

1:13:29.543 --> 1:13:31.112
I'd like to know you,
I like your vibe.

1:13:31.145 --> 1:13:32.647
Fucking empty compliments.

1:13:32.680 --> 1:13:33.681
Come here.

1:13:33.714 --> 1:13:35.650
You don't need...
you don't need to do this.

1:13:35.683 --> 1:13:36.584
Hey, fuck you.

1:13:36.617 --> 1:13:39.086
Look, you stay right
the fuck here, okay?

1:13:39.120 --> 1:13:40.221
Look, stay right here.

1:13:40.254 --> 1:13:42.489
Look at me!
Stay here, okay?

1:13:42.523 --> 1:13:45.092
You fucking move an inch
while we're gone,

1:13:45.126 --> 1:13:47.128
cock off, life gone,
cock off, life gone.

1:13:47.161 --> 1:13:48.529
That fucking order.

1:13:48.562 --> 1:13:50.463
You will feel it.

1:13:53.834 --> 1:13:55.069
What do you think?

1:13:55.102 --> 1:13:56.170
I hate that motherfucker!

1:13:56.203 --> 1:13:58.072
Yeah, I see why
you feel that way.

1:13:58.105 --> 1:13:59.840
- You don't?
- Well, I mean,

1:13:59.874 --> 1:14:01.474
I know I'm being
all macho in there,

1:14:01.509 --> 1:14:02.610
but I don't think he's lying.

1:14:02.643 --> 1:14:03.978
Dude, he's a fucking liar!

1:14:04.011 --> 1:14:05.746
Look at you though,
you're an emotional mess.

1:14:05.780 --> 1:14:07.148
You can't even think straight,
dude.

1:14:07.181 --> 1:14:08.082
You can think straight?

1:14:08.115 --> 1:14:10.885
Yeah, yeah, straight
as a black arrow, okay?

1:14:10.918 --> 1:14:12.987
And I think if we just sit him
down and we have a talk...

1:14:13.020 --> 1:14:15.690
We walk in, we kill him,
we go to Mexico.

1:14:15.723 --> 1:14:17.858
You know I've never
really killed anybody, right?

1:14:17.892 --> 1:14:19.260
I've been lying,
I've been telling fibs.

1:14:19.293 --> 1:14:21.529
If you're my best friend,
you fucking kill him.

1:14:21.562 --> 1:14:24.765
Yeah, I will kill him,
I'll kill anybody you want,

1:14:24.799 --> 1:14:27.168
but you gotta give me three
minutes with him first, okay?

1:14:27.201 --> 1:14:28.501
I gotta check something.

1:14:28.536 --> 1:14:30.237
- Three minutes?
- Three minutes.

1:14:30.271 --> 1:14:32.239
You're asking me
to fucking kill somebody, okay?

1:14:32.273 --> 1:14:34.075
It's the least you can do.

1:14:42.683 --> 1:14:44.919
A lot of options here, Sam.

1:14:44.952 --> 1:14:47.621
You're a businessman,
you know it's hard to, uh,

1:14:47.655 --> 1:14:50.725
pull the trigger sometimes,
so to speak.

1:14:50.758 --> 1:14:52.760
Come here.

1:14:52.793 --> 1:14:56.864
Think you made a few mistakes
with my buddy out there.

1:14:56.897 --> 1:14:58.566
Come a little closer.

1:14:58.599 --> 1:15:00.267
Perch up real good.

1:15:02.603 --> 1:15:06.307
So, we're gonna play a game now.

1:15:06.340 --> 1:15:08.075
I'm not talking Monopoly.

1:15:08.109 --> 1:15:11.645
I'm talking Ouija board,
next-level shit.

1:15:11.679 --> 1:15:13.614
You ready for that?

1:15:13.647 --> 1:15:14.615
Sure.

1:15:14.648 --> 1:15:17.251
Let me ask you a question first.

1:15:17.284 --> 1:15:18.619
Are you a good man?

1:15:18.652 --> 1:15:19.687
I'm okay.

1:15:19.720 --> 1:15:21.222
You sure about that?

1:15:21.255 --> 1:15:22.890
Yeah.

1:15:24.625 --> 1:15:27.028
You ever go crazy before?

1:15:27.061 --> 1:15:30.598
Like your head was spinning
around in a dryer set on high?

1:15:30.631 --> 1:15:32.967
- Huh, have you?
- Yeah.

1:15:33.000 --> 1:15:34.635
- For real?
- Yeah.

1:15:34.668 --> 1:15:35.870
Yeah?

1:15:35.903 --> 1:15:38.706
All right,
then you're invited in.

1:15:38.739 --> 1:15:41.275
Stare into my eyes, okay,
stare deep into my eyes.

1:15:41.308 --> 1:15:42.977
Not this one, this one's dead.

1:15:43.010 --> 1:15:45.079
- Stare here.
- All right.

1:15:45.112 --> 1:15:46.981
Come on in.

1:15:47.948 --> 1:15:49.583
Come in.

1:15:49.617 --> 1:15:50.584
Deeper.

1:15:50.618 --> 1:15:52.286
Come on, deeper.

1:15:52.319 --> 1:15:54.755
Deeper, deeper.

1:15:54.789 --> 1:15:56.957
Don't fear the sharks
of my soul.

1:15:56.991 --> 1:15:59.693
I only look scary.

1:15:59.727 --> 1:16:04.765
I need you to think
about dragons, okay?

1:16:04.799 --> 1:16:05.933
Got 'em?

1:16:05.966 --> 1:16:07.802
- Got it.
- Good.

1:16:09.070 --> 1:16:12.940
That's very, very, very good.

1:16:12.973 --> 1:16:14.942
You're a sensitive man,
aren't you, Sam?

1:16:14.975 --> 1:16:16.610
I'm okay.

1:16:16.644 --> 1:16:18.913
Yeah, I know you're okay.

1:16:18.946 --> 1:16:20.681
Are you sensitive?

1:16:20.714 --> 1:16:21.715
Yes, I am.

1:16:21.749 --> 1:16:24.085
Yeah, I can tell.

1:16:24.118 --> 1:16:26.320
I like it.

1:16:26.353 --> 1:16:29.390
I like it a lot.

1:16:29.423 --> 1:16:31.926
Do you feel weird
about being rich?

1:16:31.959 --> 1:16:33.127
All the time.

1:16:33.160 --> 1:16:36.363
Why don't you give
all your money away?

1:16:36.397 --> 1:16:39.266
I'm scared I won't make
any more.

1:16:39.300 --> 1:16:42.169
Why'd you buy
such a big old house?

1:16:42.203 --> 1:16:44.171
I don't know, I thought
it would impress the girls.

1:16:44.205 --> 1:16:45.239
Did it?

1:16:45.272 --> 1:16:47.274
- Yeah.
- Yeah, bees like honey.

1:16:47.308 --> 1:16:49.243
Big news.

1:16:49.276 --> 1:16:51.112
All right.

1:16:51.145 --> 1:16:53.647
I'm gonna forgive the wealth.

1:16:53.681 --> 1:16:56.317
Can you forgive my being poor?

1:16:56.350 --> 1:16:58.686
- Yes.
- You know how poor I am?

1:16:58.719 --> 1:17:00.988
- No.
- I have $11.

1:17:01.021 --> 1:17:01.989
That's it.

1:17:03.991 --> 1:17:06.293
We're gonna go
to the next level now,

1:17:06.327 --> 1:17:08.395
'cause I'm seeing
some good things in you.

1:17:08.429 --> 1:17:10.731
Can you put the gun down?

1:17:15.302 --> 1:17:17.938
We're going in deeper now.

1:17:17.972 --> 1:17:20.207
We're gonna go somewhere
not a lot of people have been.

1:17:20.241 --> 1:17:22.042
- Are you ready for that?
- Okay.

1:17:23.878 --> 1:17:27.314
Move away from the live eye.

1:17:27.348 --> 1:17:30.151
Go into the dead eye, okay?

1:17:30.184 --> 1:17:32.219
Stare into the eye
of old Dead-Eye Bill.

1:17:33.254 --> 1:17:36.390
Pass through that darkness.

1:17:36.423 --> 1:17:37.892
In there?

1:17:39.793 --> 1:17:43.430
Oh yeah, you're in there.

1:17:43.464 --> 1:17:47.001
We're gonna have to do this
for a long, long time,

1:17:47.034 --> 1:17:50.004
and you're gonna show me
just who you are.

1:18:25.172 --> 1:18:26.941
Whoa!

1:18:28.876 --> 1:18:31.245
Okay, Sam.

1:18:31.278 --> 1:18:32.813
Okay.

1:18:37.552 --> 1:18:38.520
- Hey.
- Yeah.

1:18:38.553 --> 1:18:39.453
So?

1:18:39.486 --> 1:18:41.188
So he's a living,
breathing man, dude.

1:18:41.222 --> 1:18:42.890
Living, breathing man?

1:18:42.923 --> 1:18:44.825
Yeah, yeah, he's good, okay?

1:18:44.858 --> 1:18:46.026
I took him into the house
of my soul.

1:18:46.060 --> 1:18:48.262
I spun him around, I looked
at him from every fucking angle,

1:18:48.295 --> 1:18:50.130
and he's good,
and we should give him the kid.

1:18:50.164 --> 1:18:52.132
No! Fuck this, fuck this plan.
Give me the gun.

1:18:52.166 --> 1:18:53.535
Put your money
where your mouth is.

1:18:53.568 --> 1:18:55.336
- What do you mean?
- I mean we're always talking

1:18:55.369 --> 1:18:57.438
love, right?
Love, love, love?

1:18:57.471 --> 1:18:59.173
- Try to love him.
- Oh my God,

1:18:59.206 --> 1:19:01.175
this is the guy
who ruined my fucking life,

1:19:01.208 --> 1:19:03.210
- who stole my fucking family.
- Yeah, yeah, right?

1:19:03.244 --> 1:19:05.980
Now he's inviting you back
into his family, right?

1:19:06.013 --> 1:19:07.815
He invited me back
into his fucking family?

1:19:07.848 --> 1:19:08.882
Give me the gun,
give me the gun.

1:19:08.916 --> 1:19:10.251
- Fine, you want the gun?
- Yeah.

1:19:10.284 --> 1:19:11.519
- Fine, here.
- This is my fucking choice,

1:19:11.553 --> 1:19:13.988
- this is my fucking choice.
- Fine, here's the fucking gun,

1:19:14.021 --> 1:19:17.057
but listen, you kill him,
little George hears, right?

1:19:17.091 --> 1:19:19.827
Right? And we can tell him
it's big, big popcorn right now,

1:19:19.860 --> 1:19:21.428
but when he turns 13,
old man memory

1:19:21.462 --> 1:19:23.964
is gonna start answering
questions and he's gonna know.

1:19:23.998 --> 1:19:26.000
He's gonna know Uncle Bill
and Daddy Andy

1:19:26.033 --> 1:19:27.401
are fucking murderers.

1:19:27.434 --> 1:19:29.103
You think that's good for a kid?

1:19:29.136 --> 1:19:31.272
You think that's good
for sensitive guys like us?

1:19:31.305 --> 1:19:33.007
It'll fucking make us cry, dude.

1:19:33.040 --> 1:19:36.377
We'll be crying and having
nightmares about him for years,

1:19:36.410 --> 1:19:39.380
and so will little George,
and then think about this, dude:

1:19:39.413 --> 1:19:41.482
His ghost is gonna haunt us.

1:19:41.516 --> 1:19:44.018
You want to spend the rest
of your life haunted by a ghost?

1:19:44.051 --> 1:19:46.120
Fucking floating over your bed?

1:19:46.153 --> 1:19:48.289
Dripping fucking ectoplasm
all over you,

1:19:48.322 --> 1:19:49.923
you're all goopy and shit?

1:19:49.957 --> 1:19:52.826
It's your choice,
you do what you want.

1:19:52.860 --> 1:19:54.428
You think about it though.

1:19:54.461 --> 1:19:56.830
Hey.

1:19:56.864 --> 1:19:58.499
What are you gonna do?

1:20:10.512 --> 1:20:12.880
Treat Bonnie and George right.

1:20:14.181 --> 1:20:15.282
You lucked out, bud.

1:20:15.316 --> 1:20:16.884
You're in the family.

1:20:18.886 --> 1:20:21.221
Kid's in the bathroom.

1:20:21.255 --> 1:20:22.489
You made the right choice.

1:20:22.524 --> 1:20:24.892
You just better be as cool
as I think you are,

1:20:24.925 --> 1:20:26.960
'cause I'm looking forward
to hanging out with you.

1:20:36.170 --> 1:20:38.339
Bill, I feel like
I'm shattered apart.

1:20:38.372 --> 1:20:41.041
It's 'cause you are, dude.
You are.

1:20:41.075 --> 1:20:43.578
If I was Bonnie,
I would have left me too.

1:20:43.611 --> 1:20:45.112
Dude, if you were Bonnie?

1:20:45.145 --> 1:20:47.014
No, dude, you'd be stoked
that you met

1:20:47.047 --> 1:20:49.584
one of the coolest individuals
of all time, all right?

1:20:49.617 --> 1:20:51.352
Andy fucking Chen.

1:20:51.385 --> 1:20:52.554
But Bonnie's Bonnie.

1:20:52.587 --> 1:20:53.555
Bonnie's gone.

1:20:53.588 --> 1:20:55.289
Yeah, well, who's here?

1:20:55.322 --> 1:20:57.559
Your ultimate homie
now and forevermore.

1:20:57.592 --> 1:21:01.028
Beautiful Bill Andrews
at your service.

1:21:01.061 --> 1:21:02.597
Come on, let's get you a taco.

1:21:02.630 --> 1:21:03.665
Come on.

1:21:03.698 --> 1:21:05.232
Get you some food.

1:21:05.265 --> 1:21:08.335
I'm talking tacos,
burritos, tostadas.

1:21:08.369 --> 1:21:10.170
What kinda drink you want?

1:21:10.204 --> 1:21:11.472
What do you want, Coca-Cola?

1:21:11.506 --> 1:21:12.373
Cocktail.

1:21:12.406 --> 1:21:14.576
Whatever kind you want, bud.
Manhattan?

1:25:23.490 --> 1:25:25.258
Thank you, boys.
