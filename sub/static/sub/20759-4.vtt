19:55.319 --> 19:57.530
Hey! Don't tell me what to do!

19:59.073 --> 20:00.950
Sorry, guys. Got to run.

20:01.033 --> 20:03.202
Someone take over the crank
so the world doesn't end.

20:03.285 --> 20:06.205
[upbeat music]

20:08.916 --> 20:11.836
Using a toilet is how corporations
collect our DNA.

20:11.919 --> 20:13.713
So just go anywhere out here.

20:13.796 --> 20:15.089
Thank you, Gordy.

20:15.172 --> 20:16.465
That makes sense.

20:23.139 --> 20:28.352
And that's when I knew
that Jodie Foster was gay,

20:28.436 --> 20:31.564
because that would've really impressed me.

20:31.647 --> 20:33.566
You're losing the thread here,
Kaushtupper.

20:33.649 --> 20:37.278
That started as a story about
streaking <i>The Robin Byrd Show.</i>

20:37.361 --> 20:39.029
What's the point?

20:39.113 --> 20:41.532
-[cell phone ringing]
-Mm!

20:41.615 --> 20:43.325
Ah! Titus.

20:43.409 --> 20:46.120
Ah, you're in for it now, Goodman.

20:46.203 --> 20:49.123
If I get this guy going
on one of his rants,

20:49.206 --> 20:51.500
we'll be here all night.

20:52.209 --> 20:55.796
You know what I love, Titus? Zoos!

20:55.880 --> 20:57.339
[Titus sighs] <i>Don't get me started.</i>

20:57.423 --> 20:59.008
If I wanted to see a bunch
of naked animals,

20:59.091 --> 21:01.051
I'd watch <i>The Robin Byrd Show</i> and--

21:01.135 --> 21:02.595
I don't have time for this.

21:02.678 --> 21:04.221
Lillian, I need your advice.

21:04.305 --> 21:06.098
Just so you know, you're on speakerphone.

21:06.182 --> 21:07.767
Artie Goodman here.

21:07.850 --> 21:10.060
[Titus] <i>Now I want to do a rant</i>
<i>about speakerphones.</i>

21:10.144 --> 21:11.061
Tell me about it.

21:11.145 --> 21:13.397
You ever try to do a conference call
on speaker?

21:13.481 --> 21:15.775
Sir, you should be able to tell
that I have not.

21:16.525 --> 21:18.319
Lillian, I'm calling you
because I know Kimmy

21:18.402 --> 21:20.404
would not give me the answer that I want.

21:20.488 --> 21:22.156
I've been asked to sing lead vocals

21:22.239 --> 21:23.407
in exchange for money.

21:23.491 --> 21:25.117
What-- what's the problem?

21:25.201 --> 21:28.496
[Titus] <i>The problem is,</i>
<i>this song is deeply offensive.</i>

21:28.579 --> 21:30.289
But I'm getting paid $100 an hour,

21:30.372 --> 21:32.833
and you know how badly I want a star
named after me.

21:32.917 --> 21:34.084
[Lillian] <i>Titus,</i>

21:34.168 --> 21:35.544
if you want something,

21:35.628 --> 21:38.047
you do whatever it takes to get it.

21:38.130 --> 21:40.424
I mean, right now, I'm standing

21:40.508 --> 21:42.843
next to a bucket of my own urine.

21:42.927 --> 21:45.262
She is. It's disgusting.

21:45.346 --> 21:47.014
This is Artie again, Titus.

21:47.097 --> 21:49.642
Ugh, but the lyrics.

21:49.725 --> 21:51.936
Oh, if you sell it,

21:52.019 --> 21:54.688
nobody cares what a song is about.

21:54.772 --> 21:58.901
Some of our biggest hits
are just disgusting.

21:58.984 --> 22:02.488
"Young Girl" is a love song to jailbait.

22:02.571 --> 22:05.741
"Baby It's Cold Outside"
is a Christmas song

22:05.825 --> 22:09.078
advocating false imprisonment.

22:09.161 --> 22:11.997
"The Piña Colada Song"
is about a couple having an affair.

22:12.081 --> 22:16.669
Yeah, and who sings about piña coladas
that much?

22:16.752 --> 22:18.295
It's stupid.

22:18.379 --> 22:20.172
Also, as someone
who's made love on a beach,

22:20.256 --> 22:21.590
a word of advice:

22:21.674 --> 22:23.759
check the tide schedule ahead of time.

22:23.843 --> 22:25.469
[Titus] <i>Thank you, Lillian and Artie.</i>

22:25.553 --> 22:28.055
I knew you guys would give me
the answer I wanted.

[inhales deeply]

22:30.933 --> 22:31.850

22:31.934 --> 22:33.769
Your task rabbit has arrived.

22:33.852 --> 22:37.565
Oh, thank angry Old Testament God,

22:37.648 --> 22:40.067
the one who's always threatening
to kill children

22:40.150 --> 22:41.443
to prove a point!

22:41.527 --> 22:43.571
Here. [laughing]

22:59.670 --> 23:01.839
[dramatic music]

23:01.922 --> 23:04.758
Kimmy, what kind of tea was that?

23:04.842 --> 23:06.010
The strongest they had.

23:06.093 --> 23:07.344
It had a bear on the box,

23:07.428 --> 23:08.971
and nothing's stronger than a bear!

23:09.054 --> 23:10.639
What was the bear wearing?

23:10.723 --> 23:13.350
-What was it wearing, Kimmy?
-People clothes.

23:13.434 --> 23:16.103
I'm telling you, this bear killed someone
and took over his life!

23:16.186 --> 23:18.480
-Oh, no.
-Oh, boy. Those were pajamas.

23:18.564 --> 23:20.232
-That's Sleepytime tea.
-[Kimmy] Yeah!

23:20.316 --> 23:22.735
For those times when you're sleepy
and don't want to be,

23:22.818 --> 23:25.237
like how Hungry-Man dinners
are for when a man is hungry.

23:25.321 --> 23:26.947
But it says "caffeine free."

23:27.031 --> 23:29.450
'Cause you don't pay extra
for the caffeine!

23:29.533 --> 23:30.993
It's free!

23:47.009 --> 23:47.885
Sell it,

on a snowman,

for her to exist.

a rowing machine.

Stop trying to cheer me up

Right now, it probably feels like
the world is ending,

you wanted to come here
in the first place.

26:25.334 --> 26:26.502
I didn't.

I wanted to get as far away
from this place as possible.

what had happened,

29:02.991 --> 29:06.328
I was at pains to understand
what you were thinking, Xanthippe.

29:06.411 --> 29:08.789
You've been given every advantage
in the world.

29:08.872 --> 29:11.625

student in your class

29:11.708 --> 29:12.960
after Sophie Tylenol.

29:13.752 --> 29:17.923
But then we realized
exactly how brave and beautiful

29:18.006 --> 29:20.217
your act of destruction truly was.

the family crest with alcohol,

used liquor

29:47.119 --> 29:49.329
to lure Irish children
into their factories.

29:49.413 --> 29:52.541
And you intentionally targeted
this image of a horse

29:52.624 --> 29:54.793
because the Voorhees fortune
came from making glue

29:54.876 --> 29:56.378
from horses' faces.
