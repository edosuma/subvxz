05:41.591 --> 05:43.184
Hautecourt.

05:43.343 --> 05:46.438
Oh, my goodness, Edgar.
I know Georges.

05:46.596 --> 05:49.941
Adelaide, my dear.

05:51.726 --> 05:54.696
So good to see you, Georges.

05:54.855 --> 05:56.823
Aaah!

05:56.982 --> 06:00.532
Still the softest
hands in all Paris.

06:00.694 --> 06:04.324
You're a shameless
flatterer, Georges.

06:06.700 --> 06:09.294
Adelaide, that's music.

06:09.452 --> 06:11.204
It's from Carmen, isn't it?

06:11.371 --> 06:14.295
That's right. It was
my favourite role.

06:14.457 --> 06:16.380
Yes, yes.

06:16.543 --> 06:20.468
It was the night of your grand
premiere that we first met. Remember?

06:20.630 --> 06:24.134
- Oh, indeed, I do.
- And how we celebrated your success.

06:24.301 --> 06:27.646
Champagne, dancing
the night away...

06:33.351 --> 06:36.321
Oh, Georges.

06:52.329 --> 06:53.831
Oh, ho!

06:56.666 --> 06:57.792
Thank goodness.

06:59.336 --> 07:01.054
Just in time.

07:01.838 --> 07:03.055
Ah, Georges.

07:03.214 --> 07:07.515
We're just a pair of
sentimental old fools.

07:12.349 --> 07:14.693
Now, Georges, do be serious.

07:15.060 --> 07:19.531
I've asked you to come here on
a very important legal matter.

07:19.689 --> 07:21.032
Oh? Oh!

07:21.191 --> 07:22.989
Splendid, splendid.

07:23.151 --> 07:25.279
Who do you want me to sue, eh?

07:25.445 --> 07:28.540
Come now, Georges. I don't
wish you to sue anyone.

07:28.698 --> 07:30.871
I simply want to make my will.

07:31.034 --> 07:34.538
Will, eh? Will, will...

07:38.333 --> 07:41.337
Now, then, who are
the beneficiaries?

07:41.503 --> 07:45.098
Well, as you know, I have
no living relatives.

07:45.256 --> 07:48.260
Naturally, I want my beloved cats

07:48.426 --> 07:50.554
to be always well-cared for.

07:50.720 --> 07:54.566
Certainly, no one can do this better
than my faithful servant, Edgar.

07:54.724 --> 07:56.192
Edgar?

07:56.351 --> 08:00.322
Adelaide, you mean to say you're
leaving your vast fortune to Edgar?

08:01.064 --> 08:05.240
Everything you possess?
Stocks and bonds?

08:05.402 --> 08:07.700
This mansion? Your country chateau?

08:07.862 --> 08:10.206
Your treasures, jewels, and...?

08:10.365 --> 08:12.538
Oh, no, no, Georges.

08:12.701 --> 08:15.545
- To my cats.
- To your cats?

08:15.704 --> 08:16.751
Cats?

08:16.913 --> 08:18.039
Yes, Georges.

08:18.206 --> 08:21.255
I simply wish to have
the cats inherit first.

08:21.418 --> 08:26.219
Then, at the end of their lifespan,
my entire estate will revert to Edgar.

08:26.381 --> 08:28.429
Cats inherit first?

08:28.591 --> 08:30.264
And I come after the cats.

08:30.427 --> 08:32.429
I, me, after...

08:32.595 --> 08:34.438
It's... it's not fair.

08:34.597 --> 08:36.599
Whoo! I mean, whoo.

08:36.765 --> 08:38.438
Each cat will live about 12 years.

08:38.601 --> 08:40.945
I can't wait... And each
cat has nine lives.

08:41.104 --> 08:42.902
That's four times 12...

08:43.063 --> 08:44.987
Multiply by nine times...

08:45.150 --> 08:48.871
No, it's less than that. Anyway,
it's much longer than I'd ever live.

08:49.988 --> 08:51.365
I'll be gone.

08:52.782 --> 08:54.034
No.

08:54.200 --> 08:56.874
Oh, no. They'll be gone.

08:57.037 --> 08:59.165
I'll think of a way.

08:59.330 --> 09:02.129
Oh... there are a million
reasons why I should.

09:02.292 --> 09:04.135
All of 'em dollars.

09:04.961 --> 09:06.963
Millions.

09:08.673 --> 09:10.767
Those cats have got to go.

09:13.636 --> 09:15.138
Wait for me, wait for me!

09:15.305 --> 09:17.774
Me first, me first. Whoo.

09:17.932 --> 09:19.525
Why should you be first?

09:19.684 --> 09:22.233
Because I'm a lady, that's why.

09:22.395 --> 09:24.363
Ha-ha. You're not a lady.

09:24.522 --> 09:26.695
You're nothin' but a sister.

09:27.275 --> 09:28.492
Oh!

09:29.778 --> 09:32.156
I'll show you if I'm a lady or not.

09:37.410 --> 09:40.254
- You're tickling.
- Get her, Berlioz, get her.

09:45.668 --> 09:47.261
Fight fair, Marie.

09:47.420 --> 09:49.548
Females never fight fair.

09:50.840 --> 09:52.342
Ow! Now, that hurt.

09:52.509 --> 09:53.931
Mama! Mama!

09:54.094 --> 09:56.517
Marie, darling, Marie,
you must stop that.

09:56.679 --> 09:58.602
This, this is really not ladylike.

09:58.765 --> 10:01.314
And Berlioz?

10:01.476 --> 10:05.447
Such behaviour is most unbecoming
to a lovely gentleman.

10:05.605 --> 10:07.528
Well, she started it.

10:07.690 --> 10:12.446
Ladies do not start fights,
but they can finish them.

10:12.612 --> 10:14.364
Berlioz.

10:14.531 --> 10:15.999
Now, don't be rude.

10:16.157 --> 10:18.956
We were just practising
biting and clawing.

10:19.119 --> 10:23.295
Aristocrats do not practise
biting and clawing

10:23.456 --> 10:25.458
and things like that.
That's just horrible.

10:25.625 --> 10:28.424
But someday we might
meet a tough alley cat.

10:34.384 --> 10:35.931
That will do.

with self-improvement.

10:39.681 --> 10:43.231

charming ladies and gentlemens.

10:43.393 --> 10:46.317
Now, Toulouse, you go and
start on with your painting.

10:46.479 --> 10:47.696
Yes, Mama.

10:50.316 --> 10:54.913
Mama, may we watch Toulouse paint
before we start our music lesson?

10:55.071 --> 10:56.493
Please?

10:56.656 --> 10:58.454
Well, yes, my love, but...

10:58.616 --> 11:01.039

11:36.779 --> 11:39.123

14:58.648 --> 15:02.653
Your favourite dish,
prepared a very special way.

15:02.819 --> 15:06.323
It's crème de la crème à la Edgar.

15:06.489 --> 15:10.244
Sleep well... I mean,
eat well, of course.

15:26.342 --> 15:28.686
Good evening, Duchess.

15:28.845 --> 15:31.724
- Hello, kittens.
- Hello, Roquefort.

15:31.889 --> 15:35.018
- Hi, Roquefort.
- Good evening, Monsieur Roquefort.

15:35.184 --> 15:38.609
Mm. Something smells awfully good.

15:38.771 --> 15:42.617
What is that appetising smell?

15:42.775 --> 15:45.619
It's crème de la crème à la Edgar.

15:45.778 --> 15:48.031
Won't you join us,
Monsieur Roquefort?

15:48.197 --> 15:51.121
Well, yes. I mean...
I don't mean to interrupt.

15:51.284 --> 15:52.831
But...

15:52.994 --> 15:57.500
But it so happens that I
have a cracker with me.

15:57.665 --> 15:59.633
Come on, Roquefort, have some.

15:59.792 --> 16:03.387
Oh, thank you. Don't mind if I do.

16:03.546 --> 16:04.889
Just a few dunks.

16:07.216 --> 16:09.310
Mm. Oooh. Very good.

16:09.469 --> 16:11.972
My compliments to the chef.

16:12.138 --> 16:14.641
Mm. This is yummy.

16:14.807 --> 16:16.275
Mm.

16:16.434 --> 16:18.562
Delicious.

16:18.728 --> 16:20.901
Double delicious.

16:22.356 --> 16:24.654
This calls for another cracker.

16:24.817 --> 16:25.989
I'll be right back.

16:38.581 --> 16:41.425
So that's...

16:41.584 --> 16:45.384
crème de la crème...

16:46.672 --> 16:47.798
a la...

16:47.965 --> 16:49.592
Edgar.

17:52.613 --> 17:53.705
Ahhh!

18:36.157 --> 18:38.455
Lafayette. Hey, Lafayette.

18:38.618 --> 18:40.666
Lafayette!

18:40.828 --> 18:43.047
- Well, I'm right here.
- Listen.

18:43.205 --> 18:45.003
Wheels approaching.

18:45.166 --> 18:48.420
Oh, Napoleon, we done
bit six tyres today.

18:48.586 --> 18:51.556
Chased four motorcars and
a bicycle and a scooter.

18:51.714 --> 18:53.341
Hush your mouth.

18:53.507 --> 18:56.101
It's a motorcycle.

18:56.260 --> 18:59.389
Two-cylinder, chain drive,

18:59.555 --> 19:03.185
one squeaky wheel on
the front, it sounds like.

19:03.351 --> 19:07.697
You go for the tyres, and I'll go
right for the seat of the problem.

19:07.855 --> 19:10.734
How come you always grab the
tender part for yourself?

19:12.026 --> 19:14.529
'Cause I outrank you, that's why.

19:14.695 --> 19:17.869
Now, stop beating your
gums and sound the attack.

19:20.701 --> 19:23.250
No, that's mess call.

19:23.412 --> 19:25.005
Yeah, made a mess of it, huh?

19:25.164 --> 19:27.087
You can be replaced, you know.

19:27.249 --> 19:29.593
OK, let's charge. Oooh.

19:29.752 --> 19:32.005
Wait a minute. I'm the leader.

19:32.171 --> 19:34.390
I'm the one that says when we go.

19:34.548 --> 19:36.676
Here we go.

19:36.842 --> 19:39.470
Charge!

20:06.831 --> 20:08.299
Whew.

20:12.795 --> 20:14.638
Ahh! Oww!

20:14.797 --> 20:17.971
Nice doggy, nice doggy.
Heel, roll over, play dead!

20:21.679 --> 20:23.522
Yow!

20:25.808 --> 20:28.482
This sure beats running, Napoleon.

21:15.149 --> 21:16.617
Step on the gas, Napoleon.

21:16.776 --> 21:18.653
I got 'er wide open.

21:34.376 --> 21:36.219
Oww!

22:09.286 --> 22:10.708
Oh!

22:10.871 --> 22:12.418
Oh, where am I?

22:12.623 --> 22:14.751
I'm not at home at all.

22:14.959 --> 22:18.759
Children, where are you? Answer me.

22:18.963 --> 22:20.431
Berlioz?

22:20.589 --> 22:22.717
Toulouse, Marie, where are you?

22:22.883 --> 22:25.727
Here I am, Mama.

22:27.388 --> 22:30.562
Marie, darling. Well,
are you all right?

22:30.724 --> 22:34.900
Uh, I guess I had a nightmare
and fell out of bed.

22:35.062 --> 22:37.611
Now, Marie, darling,
don't be frightened.

22:37.773 --> 22:39.946
Mama! Mama!

22:40.109 --> 22:41.782
That's Berlioz.

22:41.944 --> 22:44.072
Over here, darling.
Berlioz, here we are.

22:44.238 --> 22:47.037
And don't worry. Everything's
going to be all right.

22:47.199 --> 22:48.951
I'm coming, Mama.

22:50.286 --> 22:52.755
Gee, I'm cold and I'm wet.

22:52.913 --> 22:56.588
Mama?

22:56.750 --> 22:58.923
Mama!

23:00.629 --> 23:02.302
Darling.

23:03.299 --> 23:05.927
That's only a little frog, my love.

23:06.093 --> 23:08.312
He had a mouth like
a hippo-lotamus.

23:12.975 --> 23:15.148
Oh, what's so funny?

23:15.311 --> 23:18.155
Not now, darling. Darlings,
you just stay here.

23:18.314 --> 23:21.818
I go and I look for Toulouse.
Toulouse?

23:21.984 --> 23:23.986
Toulouse, where are you?

23:24.153 --> 23:27.248
- Toulouse!
- Toulouse!

23:27.406 --> 23:28.749
Toulouse!

23:28.908 --> 23:32.333
Hey! What's all the
yelling about, huh?

23:32.494 --> 23:34.588
Why didn't you answer?

23:34.747 --> 23:38.342
Mama, he's been here all the time.

23:38.500 --> 23:40.002
Oh, thank goodness.

23:40.169 --> 23:42.046
Are you all right?

23:42.212 --> 23:45.591
I was having a funny dream.

23:45.758 --> 23:47.681
Edgar was in it.

23:47.843 --> 23:50.471
And we were all riding
and bouncing along...

23:51.889 --> 23:55.689
Frogs? Uh-oh. It wasn't a dream.

23:55.851 --> 23:59.025
- Edgar did this to us.
- Edgar?

23:59.188 --> 24:02.112
Oh, darling, why, that's...

24:02.274 --> 24:04.026
Why, that's ridiculous.

24:04.193 --> 24:07.117
Yeah, maybe you fell on
your head, Toulouse.

24:09.114 --> 24:13.460
Mama, I'm afraid. I wanna go home.

24:13.619 --> 24:16.247
Now, my darling, don't be
frightened. You'll see...

24:18.332 --> 24:21.802
Oh, dear. Let's get into
the basket, all of us.

24:21.961 --> 24:24.305
What's gonna happen to us?

24:24.463 --> 24:27.137
Well, darlings, I just don't know.

24:27.299 --> 24:29.802
It does look hopeless, doesn't it?

24:29.969 --> 24:34.145
I wish we were home
with Madame right now.

24:34.306 --> 24:38.061
Oh, poor Madame.

24:38.227 --> 24:41.151
She will be so worried
when she finds us gone.

24:45.609 --> 24:48.408
Duchess? Kittens?

24:48.570 --> 24:50.197
Oh, my gracious.

24:50.364 --> 24:53.664
I had the most horrible
dream about them.

24:54.785 --> 24:57.755
Thank goodness it was only a dream.

24:58.872 --> 25:01.295
Oh, dear, what a terrible night.

25:03.335 --> 25:05.588
Now, now, my darlings.

25:05.754 --> 25:09.679
Don't be frightened.
The storm will soon pass.

25:12.344 --> 25:15.188
Oh, no! They're gone.

25:15.347 --> 25:17.941
Duchess! Kittens!

25:18.100 --> 25:21.104
Duchess! Where are you?

25:21.270 --> 25:24.774
They're gone. They're gone!

25:26.066 --> 25:28.285
Duchess? Kittens? Gone?

25:28.444 --> 25:30.242
Why, that's terrible.

25:30.404 --> 25:32.247
But where? Why?

25:32.406 --> 25:37.003
Good heavens. Anything could
happen to them on a night like this.

25:37.161 --> 25:42.418
Get washed down a storm
drain, struck by lightning...

25:42.583 --> 25:44.085
Oh, they'll need help.

25:45.169 --> 25:46.637
I've just got to find them.

25:50.299 --> 25:52.802
Duchess! Kittens?

26:00.976 --> 26:03.024
Duchess!

26:03.187 --> 26:05.110
Kittens!

26:05.981 --> 26:08.325
Kittens!

Yeah.

28:58.737 --> 29:00.080
Bravo.

29:00.239 --> 29:03.493
Very good. You are a great talent.

29:03.659 --> 29:05.502
Oh, thank you.

29:05.661 --> 29:07.663
And what might your name be?

29:07.829 --> 29:09.672
My name is Duchess.

29:09.831 --> 29:11.879
Duchess.

29:12.042 --> 29:15.592
Beautiful. Love it.

29:15.754 --> 29:17.848
And those eyes.

29:18.006 --> 29:19.349
Oooh.

29:19.508 --> 29:23.354
Why, your eyes are like
sapphires sparkling so bright.

29:23.512 --> 29:27.312
They make the morning
radiant and light.

29:27.474 --> 29:31.650
- How romantic.
- Sissy stuff.

29:34.690 --> 29:35.691
Very poetic.

29:35.857 --> 29:38.360
But it is not quite Shakespeare.

29:38.527 --> 29:41.656
Of course not. That's
pure O'Malley, baby.

29:41.822 --> 29:43.244
Right off the cuff.

29:43.407 --> 29:45.000
I got a million of them.

29:45.158 --> 29:46.751
Oh, no more, please.

29:46.910 --> 29:49.459
I am really in a great
deal of trouble.

29:49.621 --> 29:50.873
Trouble?

29:51.039 --> 29:52.712
Helping beautiful dames...

29:52.874 --> 29:55.969
uh, uh, damsels in
distress is my specialty.

29:56.128 --> 29:58.381
Now, what's the
hang-up, your ladyship?

29:58.547 --> 30:01.972
Well, it is most important
that I get back to Paris.

30:02.134 --> 30:05.980
So if you would be just so
kind and show me the way...

30:06.138 --> 30:10.314
Show you the way?
Perish the thought.

30:10.475 --> 30:13.228
We shall fly to Paris
on a magic carpet,

30:13.395 --> 30:19.493
side by side, with the
stars as our guide.

30:19.651 --> 30:21.073
Just we two.

30:21.236 --> 30:23.910
Oh, that would be wonderful.

30:24.072 --> 30:25.870
Three?

30:26.033 --> 30:27.205
Four?

30:28.493 --> 30:29.870
Five?

30:30.037 --> 30:31.835
Oh, yes, Monsieur O'Malley.

30:31.997 --> 30:35.126
- These are my children.
- Oh, how sweet.

30:35.292 --> 30:37.590
Do you really have a magic carpet?

30:37.753 --> 30:42.008
- Are we really gonna ride on it?
- Now, now, Marie.

30:42.174 --> 30:45.895
Mama, do I have
sparkling sapphire eyes

30:46.053 --> 30:48.772
- that dazzle, too?
- Did I say that?

30:48.930 --> 30:52.025
Yes, right off your cuff.

30:52.184 --> 30:55.028
And you said we're gonna
ride on your magic carpet.

30:55.187 --> 30:58.066
Well, now, uh...
What I meant... You see, I...

30:58.231 --> 31:01.360
No poetry to cover the
situation, Monsieur O'Malley?

31:01.526 --> 31:04.700
What I had in mind was kind
of a sports model, baby.

31:04.863 --> 31:07.707
- You know, one of those...
- Perhaps a magic carpet?

31:07.866 --> 31:09.038
Built for two?

31:09.201 --> 31:12.045
I wouldn't take up much room.

31:12.204 --> 31:15.925
I understand perfectly,
Monsieur O'Malley.

31:16.083 --> 31:18.962
Well, come along, darlings.

31:23.924 --> 31:25.767
I'm a tough alley cat, too.

31:25.926 --> 31:28.145
Hey, there.

31:28.303 --> 31:31.682
You're coming on. I bet you're a
real tiger in your neighbourhood.

31:31.848 --> 31:35.068
Yeah. That's 'cause
I practise all the time.

31:35.227 --> 31:37.730
Now, now, Toulouse.
Toulouse, come along, dear.

31:37.896 --> 31:39.648
Yes, Mama.

31:39.815 --> 31:41.567
See you around, tiger.

31:46.780 --> 31:49.829
Now, that's quite a family.

31:51.284 --> 31:55.255
Come to think of it, O'Malley,
you're not a cat. You're a rat.

31:55.414 --> 31:57.963
Right? Right.

31:59.167 --> 32:02.922
- Hey, hey, hold up there.
- Yes, Monsieur O'Malley?

32:03.088 --> 32:06.683
Now look, kids,
if I said magic carpet,

32:06.842 --> 32:08.970
magic carpet it's gonna be.

32:09.136 --> 32:11.730
And it's gonna stop
for passengers...

32:12.764 --> 32:14.732
wright...

32:16.309 --> 32:17.481
here.

32:18.437 --> 32:20.860
Oh, boy, we're gonna fly after all.

32:21.022 --> 32:24.196
Another flight into the
fantasy, Monsieur O'Malley?

32:24.359 --> 32:27.533
No, no, no, baby.

32:28.655 --> 32:29.952
You just hide over there,

32:30.115 --> 32:33.164
and you leave the rest
to J. Thomas O'Malley.

32:34.035 --> 32:35.207
Quick, Mom, get in here.

32:35.370 --> 32:38.089
- But, children...
- Hurry up, Mama, hurry.

32:44.004 --> 32:47.508
One magic carpet, coming up.

32:47.674 --> 32:49.972
That's a magic carpet?

32:51.261 --> 32:54.185
<i>Sacré bleu!</i>

33:01.188 --> 33:05.034
<i>Sapristi!</i> Stupid cat.
Brainless lunatic.

33:08.904 --> 33:12.750
All right, step lively.
All aboard for Paris.

33:12.908 --> 33:16.538
Why, Mr. O'Malley, you
could have lost your life.

33:16.703 --> 33:19.547
So I got a few to spare. Nothin'.

33:19.706 --> 33:23.756
- How can we ever thank you?
- My pleasure entirely.

33:25.253 --> 33:28.427
Aloha. Auf weidersehen.

33:28.590 --> 33:31.764
<i>Bonsoir. Sayonara.</i>

33:31.927 --> 33:34.396
And all those goodbye things, baby.

33:34.554 --> 33:37.103
Sayonara, mister...

33:37.265 --> 33:38.608
Mama!

33:38.767 --> 33:40.769
Marie! Marie!

33:45.982 --> 33:47.825
Oh, Marie, are you all right?

33:47.984 --> 33:51.158
- Yes, Mama.
- Haven't we met before?

33:51.321 --> 33:54.621
And I'm so very glad we did.

33:54.783 --> 33:58.378
Thank you, Mr. O'Malley,
for saving my life.

33:58.537 --> 34:00.881
No trouble at all, little princess.

34:01.039 --> 34:04.669
And when we get to Paris, I'll
show you the time of your life.

34:04.834 --> 34:07.838
Oh, I'm so sorry, but...

34:08.004 --> 34:09.847
we just couldn't.

34:10.005 --> 34:14.181
You see, my mistress will
be so worried about us.

34:14.344 --> 34:18.315
Well, humans don't really worry
too much about their pets.

34:18.473 --> 34:21.851
Oh, no. You just don't understand.

34:22.018 --> 34:24.271
She loves us very much.

34:25.146 --> 34:30.824
Poor Madame, in that
big mansion, all alone.

34:32.070 --> 34:35.370
<i>In all our days, in tender ways,</i>

34:36.699 --> 34:38.793
<i>her love for us was shown.</i>

34:40.954 --> 34:46.051
<i>And so you see,
we can't leave her alone.</i>

34:49.379 --> 34:55.101
<i>She'd always say that we're the
greatest treasure she could own.</i>

34:58.555 --> 35:02.526
<i>Because with us she
never felt alone.</i>

35:05.395 --> 35:08.319
Oh, Roquefort, I've been
so worried about you.

35:08.481 --> 35:10.734
Did you have any luck at all?

35:10.900 --> 35:12.994
Not a sign of them, Frou-Frou.

35:13.153 --> 35:15.531
And I've searched all night.

35:15.697 --> 35:19.076
I know. And poor Madame
didn't sleep a wink, either.

35:20.410 --> 35:23.254
Oh, it's a sad day for all of us.

35:30.962 --> 35:33.010
Morning, Frou-Frou,
my pretty steed.

35:35.133 --> 35:36.851
Can you keep a secret, hmm?

35:37.010 --> 35:38.637
Of course you can.

35:40.221 --> 35:43.225
I have some news straight
from the horse's mouth,

35:43.391 --> 35:45.735
if you'll pardon the
expression, of course.

35:45.894 --> 35:49.569
Look, Frou-Frou.
I've made the headlines.

35:49.731 --> 35:53.406
"Mysterious Catnapper
Abducts Family of Cats."

35:53.568 --> 35:55.866
Aren't you proud of me?

35:56.029 --> 35:59.533
So he's the catnapper.

35:59.699 --> 36:02.327
The police said it was a
professional, masterful job.

36:02.494 --> 36:03.916
The work of a genius.

36:04.079 --> 36:06.548
Not bad, eh, Frou-Frou old girl?

36:10.752 --> 36:13.221
Oh, they won't find a
clue to implicate me.

36:13.380 --> 36:14.723
Not one single clue.

36:14.881 --> 36:17.725
Why, I'll eat my hat if they...

36:17.884 --> 36:19.136
My hat!

36:19.302 --> 36:21.054
My umbrella!

36:21.221 --> 36:22.814
Oh, oh, gracious.

36:22.972 --> 36:25.566
I've got to get those
things back tonight.

36:26.559 --> 36:29.153
But... oh, you...

36:29.312 --> 36:30.734
Why, that...

36:30.897 --> 36:35.573
sneaky, crooked, no-good butler!

36:45.245 --> 36:48.340
- Anyone for breakfast?
- What breakfast?

36:48.498 --> 36:51.627
- Where is it?
- Right under that magic carpet.

36:51.793 --> 36:54.171
But now we have to
cook up a little spell.

36:55.046 --> 36:56.548
You know. Ready?

36:57.799 --> 37:00.678
All right. First, to make
the magic begin,

37:00.844 --> 37:02.642
you wiggle your nose.

37:03.680 --> 37:05.774
And tickle your chin.

37:05.932 --> 37:07.900
Now you close your eyes.

37:09.269 --> 37:12.443
And cross your heart.

37:12.605 --> 37:15.484
Then presto, breakfast à la carte.

37:16.609 --> 37:17.610
Hooray!

37:17.777 --> 37:19.457
- We did it.
- Look, Mama, look!

37:22.490 --> 37:25.539
Why, Mr. O'Malley, you are amazing.

37:25.702 --> 37:27.329
True.

37:28.246 --> 37:29.338
True.

37:30.206 --> 37:31.503
<i>Sapristi!</i>

37:33.877 --> 37:36.175
<i>Sacré bleu!</i>

37:37.547 --> 37:40.221
Thieves! Robbers!

37:40.383 --> 37:41.885
Mangy tramps!

37:42.051 --> 37:44.395
Take that and that!

37:49.142 --> 37:54.399
Oh. Oh, what a horrible,
horrible human.

37:54.564 --> 37:58.114
Well, some humans are like that,
Duchess. I've learned to live with it.

37:58.276 --> 38:01.325
I'll show him.

38:01.488 --> 38:03.661
Hey, cool it, you little tiger.

38:03.823 --> 38:07.327
- That guy's dynamite.
- But he called us tramps.

38:07.494 --> 38:10.589
Oh, I'll be so glad
when we get back home.

38:10.747 --> 38:13.967
That's a long way off,
so we better get moving.

38:19.923 --> 38:21.596
Gee whiz.

38:21.758 --> 38:23.601
Look at that bridge.

38:23.760 --> 38:25.182
Come on, let's play train.

38:25.345 --> 38:27.268
Now, be careful, children.

38:27.430 --> 38:29.853
Marie's the caboose. All aboard!

38:30.016 --> 38:33.236
Choo choo choo, choo choo choo.

38:34.896 --> 38:36.273
Choc choo choo choo...

38:38.107 --> 38:40.610
Clickedy, clickedy,
clickedy, clickedy.

38:45.365 --> 38:47.208
- Oh, no.
- Don't panic.

38:47.367 --> 38:48.960
Down underneath here.

39:03.216 --> 39:05.890
- Mama!
- Marie!

39:06.052 --> 39:07.725
Oh, Marie!

39:07.887 --> 39:09.981
Keep your head up,
Marie! Here I come!

39:27.824 --> 39:29.701
Thomas! Thomas, up here.

39:40.545 --> 39:43.890
Gee, Marie, why did you
have to fall off the bridge?

39:46.968 --> 39:49.812
Thomas! Oh, Thomas! Take care!

39:49.971 --> 39:51.814
I'm all right, honey, don't worry.

39:51.973 --> 39:53.600
I'll see you downstream.

40:04.527 --> 40:07.201
What beautiful
countryside, Abigail.

40:07.363 --> 40:11.914
- So much like our own dear England.
- Indeed, yes.

40:12.827 --> 40:16.172
Amelia, if I walk much
farther I'll get flat feet.

40:16.331 --> 40:19.801
Abigail, we were
born with flat feet.

40:24.589 --> 40:26.717
I say. Look over there.

40:26.883 --> 40:29.386
Oh. Oh, how unusual.

40:29.552 --> 40:32.556
Fancy that. A cat
learning how to swim.

40:32.722 --> 40:34.724
He's going about it
all the wrong way.

40:34.891 --> 40:37.440
Quite. We must correct him.

40:38.686 --> 40:40.404
Sir. Sir?

40:40.563 --> 40:43.237
You are most fortunate
we happened along.

40:43.399 --> 40:45.401
Yes. We're here to help you.

40:45.568 --> 40:49.289
No, no. Back off, girls.
I'm doing fine.

40:49.447 --> 40:53.247
First, you must gain self-confidence
by striking out on your own.

40:53.409 --> 40:56.208
Go away. I'm trying
to get to shore.

40:56.371 --> 41:00.171
You will never learn to swim properly
with that willow branch in your mouth.

41:00.333 --> 41:04.759
Indeed, not. Snip, snip.
Here we go.

41:04.921 --> 41:06.548
Don't do that!

41:08.591 --> 41:10.559
You're doing splendidly.

41:10.718 --> 41:14.222
And don't worry about form.
It will come later.

41:14.389 --> 41:17.893
Oh, he takes to water
like a fish, doesn't he?

41:18.059 --> 41:21.188
A very enthusiastic pupil!

41:23.898 --> 41:27.243
No, no. This is no time
for fun and games.

41:32.281 --> 41:33.874
Gracious, Amelia.

41:34.033 --> 41:37.583
- You don't suppose...
- Oh, yes. Yes, I do.

41:37.745 --> 41:40.043
Bottoms up.

41:42.750 --> 41:44.627
Deeper!

41:48.339 --> 41:50.137
Look, Ma, there he is.

41:51.175 --> 41:53.974
You really did quite
well for a beginner.

41:54.971 --> 41:59.397
Oh, Thomas. Thank
goodness you're safe.

41:59.559 --> 42:02.938
- Keep practising.
- And toodley-pip.

42:03.938 --> 42:05.656
Can I help you, Mr. O'Malley, huh?

42:05.815 --> 42:09.490
Help? I've had all
the help I can take.

42:09.652 --> 42:13.998
Oh, mademoiselles, thank you so
much for helping Mr. O'Malley.

42:14.323 --> 42:17.497
Of course, my dear.
But first, introductions.

42:17.660 --> 42:19.833
Yes, we British like to
keep things proper.

42:21.998 --> 42:26.003
Now, I am Amelia Gabble
and this is my sister...

42:26.169 --> 42:28.467
- Miss Abigail Gabble.
- We're twin sisters.

42:28.629 --> 42:31.473
You might say we're related.

42:31.632 --> 42:34.181
How nice. I never
would have guessed.

42:35.720 --> 42:37.518
Look, they got rubber feet.

42:37.680 --> 42:39.432
Yeah.

42:40.767 --> 42:43.316
- We're on holiday.
- For a walking tour of France.

42:43.478 --> 42:47.403
- Swimming some of the way.
- On water, of course.

42:48.775 --> 42:51.995
Thomas, this is Amelia
and Abigail Gabble.

42:52.153 --> 42:55.703
Yeah, honey, get those two
web-footed lifeguards out of here.

42:55.865 --> 42:58.038
Now, now, Thomas.

42:58.201 --> 42:59.874
OK, OK, baby.

43:00.036 --> 43:02.789
Hiya, chicks.

43:02.955 --> 43:04.457
How awful.

43:08.002 --> 43:11.006
We're not chickens. We're geese.

43:11.172 --> 43:15.052
Nooo. I thought you were swans.

43:15.218 --> 43:18.222
Oh! Oh, flatterer.

43:18.387 --> 43:21.891
Your husband is very
charming and very handsome.

43:22.058 --> 43:23.480
Well...

43:23.643 --> 43:26.738
Uh, you see, I'm not
exactly her husband.

43:26.896 --> 43:30.742
Exactly? You either
are or you're not.

43:30.900 --> 43:34.029
All right. I'm not.

43:34.195 --> 43:35.242
Oh?

43:35.404 --> 43:36.781
Hm.

43:36.948 --> 43:39.542
- It's scandalous.
- He's nothing but a cad.

43:39.700 --> 43:41.828
Absolutely. Possibly a reprobate.

43:41.994 --> 43:44.543
- A roué.
- His eyes are too close together.

43:44.705 --> 43:47.754
- Shifty, too.
- Look at his crooked smile.

43:47.917 --> 43:50.420
His chin is very weak, too.

43:50.586 --> 43:54.887
Obviously, a philanderer who trifles
with unsuspecting women's hearts.

43:55.049 --> 43:57.518
How romantic.

43:59.220 --> 44:01.643
Please, please, let me explain.

44:01.806 --> 44:04.229
Thomas is a dear friend of ours.

44:04.392 --> 44:07.111
- He's just helping us to get to...
- Come on, Duchess.

44:07.270 --> 44:09.898
Come on, let's get out of here.

44:10.064 --> 44:12.192
Well, girls, see you around.

44:12.358 --> 44:15.532
- We're on our way to Paris.
- Oh, how nice.

44:15.695 --> 44:19.791
- We're going to Paris ourselves.
- Why don't you join us?

44:19.949 --> 44:22.122
I think that's a splendid idea.

44:22.285 --> 44:24.128
Oh, no.

44:24.287 --> 44:27.291
Now, uh, you stand here, dear.

44:27.456 --> 44:31.131
And, uh, let's see.
You take this position.

44:31.294 --> 44:33.888
- Duchess, you'll do nicely here.
- Very good.

44:34.046 --> 44:36.344
And, you dear, you take this place.

44:37.466 --> 44:39.434
Now, that leaves Mr. O'Malley.

44:39.594 --> 44:41.972
We can't leave him, can we?

44:43.472 --> 44:47.318
Mr. O'Malley, I think you
should be the rear end.

44:47.977 --> 44:51.777
Ready, everyone? Now, think goose.

44:51.939 --> 44:54.533
Forward march.

45:00.323 --> 45:04.123
Mama? Do we have to
waddle like they do?

45:04.285 --> 45:06.583
Yes, dear. Think goose.

45:08.623 --> 45:11.877
When we get to Paris,
you must meet Uncle Waldo.

45:12.668 --> 45:13.794
Waldo?

45:13.961 --> 45:15.463
Yes, he's our uncle.

45:15.630 --> 45:18.099
We are to meet Uncle
Waldo at Le Petit Café.

45:18.257 --> 45:22.433
Le Petit Café? Oh, that's
that famous restaurant.

45:22.595 --> 45:24.768
<i>C'est magnifique.</i>

45:29.560 --> 45:32.109
<i>Sacré bleu!</i>

45:32.271 --> 45:35.115
Oh, he bit my finger!

45:35.274 --> 45:38.278
Get out. Go! Go, get out. Scram!

45:40.780 --> 45:42.282
Good riddance!

45:52.291 --> 45:55.135
Why! Why, it's Uncle Waldo.

45:55.294 --> 45:57.217
Uncle Waldo!

45:57.380 --> 45:59.257
Abigail! Amelia!

45:59.423 --> 46:02.552
My two favourite nooses.

46:02.718 --> 46:07.224
Uncle Waldo, I do believe
you've been drinking.

46:07.390 --> 46:11.065
Oh, dear. What happened to
your lovely tail feathers?

46:11.227 --> 46:15.027
Girls, it's outrageous.

46:15.189 --> 46:18.568
Why, you won't believe
what they tried to do

46:18.734 --> 46:21.032
to your poor old Uncle Waldo.

46:21.195 --> 46:24.916
Look. Look at this.

46:25.074 --> 46:28.374
"Prime country goose
à la Provençale.

46:28.536 --> 46:31.585
Stuffed with chestnuts"?

46:31.747 --> 46:35.377
And "basted in... white wine".

46:36.919 --> 46:41.095
Basted? He's been marinated in it.

46:41.257 --> 46:42.509
Dreadful.

46:42.675 --> 46:46.600
Being British, I would
have preferred sherry.

46:48.973 --> 46:51.442
Sherry! Sherry.

46:51.600 --> 46:54.479
Oh! Oh, Uncle Waldo.

46:54.645 --> 46:58.320
- You're just too much.
- You mean he's had too much.

46:59.942 --> 47:01.819
- Abigail, Abigail.
- Yes, dear?

47:01.986 --> 47:04.614
We'd best get Uncle Waldo to bed.

47:04.780 --> 47:06.782
I say, there...

47:06.949 --> 47:10.294
what's all the
whispering about, huh?

47:10.453 --> 47:12.080
- Shh!
- Oh! Whoo-hoo!

47:12.246 --> 47:13.793
Now, now, now, girls.

47:13.956 --> 47:17.460
Girls, don't shush
your old Uncle Waldo.

47:17.626 --> 47:21.176
Why, you'll wake up the
whole neighbourhood.

47:22.673 --> 47:24.550
- Sh. No!
- Neighbourhood!

47:25.259 --> 47:27.136
Come along, Uncle Waldo.

47:27.303 --> 47:29.180
Oh, jeez, I think
we'd better be going.

47:29.347 --> 47:31.475
Oh. Right-o, girls.

47:31.640 --> 47:34.018
Birds of a feather must...

47:34.185 --> 47:35.482
together.

47:35.644 --> 47:37.738
That's "stick together".

47:38.814 --> 47:41.818
Oh, stick.

47:42.943 --> 47:45.162
Shush.

47:51.619 --> 47:53.087
You know something?

47:53.245 --> 47:55.498
I like Uncle Waldo.

47:55.664 --> 47:58.793
Especially when he's marinated.

48:03.589 --> 48:05.387
Frou-Frou, here comes Edgar.

48:05.549 --> 48:07.768
Hurry, Roquefort, hop
aboard the motorcycle.

48:07.927 --> 48:10.055
And for goodness sakes,
do be careful.

48:15.851 --> 48:19.526
Frou-Frou, tonight Operation
Catnapper will be completed.

48:19.688 --> 48:22.908
Wish me luck. Fisherman's luck.

48:30.366 --> 48:32.460
Bye, Frou-Frou. Oooh!

48:49.135 --> 48:52.105

49:49.987 --> 49:53.036
Lafayette. Lafayette.

49:53.199 --> 49:56.294
Listen.

49:56.452 --> 50:00.582
Oh, shucks, Napoleon, that ain't
nothin' but a little old cricket bug.

50:00.748 --> 50:03.422
It's squeaky shoes approaching.

50:03.584 --> 50:06.087
Oh, cricket bugs don't wear shoes.

50:06.253 --> 50:07.630
Hush your mouth.

50:07.796 --> 50:09.264
Let's see.

50:09.423 --> 50:11.926
They're Oxford shoes.

50:12.092 --> 50:14.936
Size nine and a half.

50:15.095 --> 50:17.518
Hole in the left sole,
it sounds like.

50:17.681 --> 50:19.729
- What colour are they?
- They're black...

50:19.892 --> 50:21.986
Now, how would I know that?

50:24.772 --> 50:27.616
Hey! Now the squeaking has stopped.

50:27.775 --> 50:30.779
I still say it was a
little old cricket bug.

50:30.945 --> 50:34.916
I'm the leader.
I'll decide what it was.

50:36.992 --> 50:38.665
It was a little old cricket bug.

50:38.827 --> 50:41.455
I'll see ya in the
morning, Napoleon.

51:10.734 --> 51:13.362
That's my hat. I'm the leader.

51:13.529 --> 51:15.952
Well, shoot fire.
Don't get sore at me.

51:16.115 --> 51:17.708
I ain't done nothin'.

52:03.037 --> 52:04.584
Ooh. Oh.

52:06.165 --> 52:07.212

Oooh. Right there. That's good.

52:38.864 --> 52:41.834
Oooh.

53:12.398 --> 53:16.073
It's so warm... and cosy.

53:29.248 --> 53:31.171
- Oooh.
- Aaah!

53:31.333 --> 53:33.006
Oooh.

53:34.420 --> 53:38.516
What's going on? Lafayette, what

53:38.674 --> 53:41.348
Aw, I get blamed for everything.

53:41.510 --> 53:44.354
Wait a minute. Where's my hat?

53:44.513 --> 53:47.687
What? And somebody
stole my bumbershoot.

53:47.850 --> 53:50.319
Where's my beddy-bye basket?

53:50.477 --> 53:54.027
Whoever it is, is gonna
get it and get it good.

53:54.189 --> 53:57.363
This time I get the tender part.

53:57.526 --> 53:59.949
Hush your mouth. Now, come on.

54:11.790 --> 54:15.715
Hey, Napoleon,
it's them shoes again.

54:15.878 --> 54:17.846
Yeah, yeah, I hear 'em.

54:19.214 --> 54:22.218
Napoleon, I'm plumb
goose-pimply scared.

54:22.384 --> 54:25.354
Now, this is no time
to turn chicken.

54:34.021 --> 54:37.241
I got a feelin' this case
is gonna bust wide open.

54:37.399 --> 54:38.946
Whoo-hoo!

54:43.071 --> 54:45.073
Did you see him?

54:45.240 --> 54:48.084
No, no, he sneaked up
behind me and tailgated me.

54:48.243 --> 54:50.712
Well, he didn't hurt me.
He hit me on the head.

54:50.871 --> 54:52.748
Shh. Listen.

54:53.832 --> 54:57.427
Sounds like a one-wheel...

54:57.586 --> 55:01.432
- A one-wheel what?
- You're not gonna believe this.

55:01.590 --> 55:04.059
But it's a one-wheeled haystack.

55:04.218 --> 55:06.312
Hey, there it go. Come on.

55:06.470 --> 55:08.097
After it!

55:12.059 --> 55:13.339
I got him, I got him, I got him!

55:13.435 --> 55:14.436
Ow! That's me.

55:14.603 --> 55:16.276
Whoa, whoa. Oh!

55:16.438 --> 55:17.860
Get him, get him.

55:20.609 --> 55:21.861
Ooh. Ow.

55:24.947 --> 55:29.168
Well, <i>c'est la guerre</i>, Napoleon.
I guess you can't win 'em all.

55:29.910 --> 55:31.457
Ow. Oooh, oooh.

55:31.620 --> 55:33.463
Criminently!

55:51.431 --> 55:54.560
But, Thomas, Madame
will be so worried.

55:54.726 --> 55:56.899
Are you sure we can't
get home tonight?

55:57.062 --> 55:59.406
Mama, I'm tired.

55:59.565 --> 56:01.818
Me, too, and my feet hurt.

56:01.984 --> 56:03.452
Look, baby,

56:03.610 --> 56:06.830
it's late and the kids are bushed.

56:06.989 --> 56:09.412
I'll bet we walked a hundred miles.

56:09.575 --> 56:12.249
I'll bet it's more than a thousand.

56:12.411 --> 56:14.584
Now, now, darlings, cheer up.

56:14.746 --> 56:17.920
Mr. O'Malley knows a place
where we can stay tonight.

56:18.083 --> 56:20.336
How much farther
is it, Mr. O'Malley?

56:20.502 --> 56:22.846
Keep your whiskers up, tiger.

56:23.005 --> 56:25.804
It's just beyond that
next chimney pot.

56:27.175 --> 56:31.271
Well, there it is.
My own penthouse pad.

56:31.430 --> 56:35.355
It's not exactly the Ritz,
but it's peaceful and quiet.

56:37.352 --> 56:39.571
Oh! Oh, no.

56:39.730 --> 56:43.530
Sounds like Scat Cat and
his gang have dropped by.

56:43.692 --> 56:48.038
- Oh, friends of yours?
- Yeah, they're old buddies,

56:48.196 --> 56:50.039
and they're real swingers.

56:50.198 --> 56:52.701
"Schwingers"?
What is a "schwinger"?

56:52.868 --> 56:56.122
You know, not exactly
your type, Duchess.

56:56.288 --> 56:58.882
Maybe we'd better find
another place, huh?

56:59.041 --> 57:02.170
Oh, no, no, no. I would
like to see your pad

57:02.336 --> 57:03.713
and meet your Scat Cat.

57:03.879 --> 57:05.472
Well, OK.

57:07.799 --> 57:12.555
Hey, Scat Cat, blow some of
that sweet stuff my way.

57:15.724 --> 57:18.193
Well, lookie here.

57:18.352 --> 57:21.231
Big man O'Malley's
back in his alley.

57:21.396 --> 57:23.319
Swing on down here, daddy.

57:24.733 --> 57:27.077
Lay some skin on me, Scat Cat.

57:27.235 --> 57:28.407
Yeah.

57:28.570 --> 57:30.572
<i>Buona sera, paesano.</i>

57:30.739 --> 57:32.207
Welcome home, O'Malley.

57:32.366 --> 57:36.291
Duchess, this is the
greatest cat of them all.

57:36.453 --> 57:40.048
Oh, I'm delighted to meet
you, Monsieur Scat Cat.

57:40.207 --> 57:41.880
Likewise, Duchess.

57:42.042 --> 57:44.511
You're too much.

57:44.670 --> 57:47.844
You are charming.

57:48.006 --> 57:49.849
And your music is so...

57:50.676 --> 57:54.271
So different, so exciting.

57:54.429 --> 57:57.729
It isn't Beethoven, Mama,
but it sure bounces.

57:59.226 --> 58:03.072
Say, this kitten-cat
knows where it's at.

58:03.230 --> 58:04.607

wham, they're right there.

01:03:48.116 --> 01:03:51.791

you were right there.

01:04:11.222 --> 01:04:13.145
No, no, no, I like it.

01:04:13.308 --> 01:04:17.859
Well, all it needs is
a little tidying up,

01:04:18.021 --> 01:04:22.071
and maybe a little feminine touch.

01:04:22.233 --> 01:04:25.077
Well, if you're applying
for the job, well...

01:04:25.236 --> 01:04:28.911
Goody. Mother's going to
work for Mr. O'Malley.

01:04:29.991 --> 01:04:34.622
Boy. Your eyes are like sapphires.

01:04:36.623 --> 01:04:37.795
Gee.

01:04:39.125 --> 01:04:40.798
That's pretty corny though, huh?

01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:44.134
Oh, no. Not at all.

01:04:44.297 --> 01:04:46.174
Any woman would like it.

01:04:46.341 --> 01:04:48.844
I-I mean...

01:04:49.010 --> 01:04:50.683
even little Marie.

01:04:51.846 --> 01:04:53.348
Yeah.

01:04:53.515 --> 01:04:55.768
All those little kittens, Duchess.

01:04:56.810 --> 01:04:58.027
I love 'em.

01:04:58.186 --> 01:05:00.029
And they are very fond of you.

01:05:00.188 --> 01:05:01.235
- Yeah.
- Shh.

01:05:01.398 --> 01:05:05.699
You know, they need...
Well, you know, a sort...

01:05:05.860 --> 01:05:09.831
Well, a sort of a...
Well, a father around.

01:05:09.989 --> 01:05:13.038
Oh, Thomas, Thomas,
that would be wonderful.

01:05:16.037 --> 01:05:19.007
Darling, if only I could.

01:05:19.165 --> 01:05:20.838
But why can't you?

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:22.673
Because of Madame.

01:05:22.836 --> 01:05:25.385
I could never leave her.

01:05:25.547 --> 01:05:28.551
But... But Madame's...

01:05:29.467 --> 01:05:31.469
Well, she's just another human.

01:05:31.636 --> 01:05:34.139
You're just her house pets.

01:05:34.305 --> 01:05:35.727
Oh, no, no.

01:05:35.890 --> 01:05:38.769
We mean far more to her than that.

01:05:40.562 --> 01:05:42.906
Oh, I'm sorry, my dear.

01:05:44.065 --> 01:05:46.409
We just have to go home tomorrow.

01:05:46.568 --> 01:05:48.445
Yeah.

01:05:48.611 --> 01:05:51.831
Well, I guess you know best.

01:05:53.074 --> 01:05:54.826
But I'm gonna miss you, baby.

01:05:54.993 --> 01:05:57.837
And those kids...

01:05:57.996 --> 01:06:01.500
Gee, I'm gonna miss them too.

01:06:01.666 --> 01:06:04.010
Well, we almost had a father.

01:06:04.169 --> 01:06:06.388
Yeah.

01:06:06.546 --> 01:06:08.594
Let's go back to bed.

01:06:12.260 --> 01:06:14.558
Good night, Duchess.

01:06:15.597 --> 01:06:17.395
Good night, Thomas.

01:06:41.122 --> 01:06:42.465
Hey.

01:06:42.624 --> 01:06:46.128
Meow!

01:06:46.294 --> 01:06:48.262
What a classy neighbourhood.

01:06:48.421 --> 01:06:51.641
Dig these fancy wigwams.

01:06:51.799 --> 01:06:53.051
Wigwams?

01:06:53.218 --> 01:06:55.312
Are you sure we're
on the right street?

01:06:55.470 --> 01:06:58.314
Yes. Yes, let's hurry.
We're almost home.

01:06:58.473 --> 01:07:02.774
Duchess! Kittens!
Hallelujah, they're back!

01:07:07.982 --> 01:07:10.030
Oh, no. Edgar!

01:07:10.193 --> 01:07:11.991
I've got to do something, quick.

01:07:12.153 --> 01:07:13.996
Oh, ha.

01:07:14.155 --> 01:07:17.329
Edgar, old chap, get used to
the finer things in life.

01:07:17.492 --> 01:07:20.621
Someday they're all
going to be yours,

01:07:20.787 --> 01:07:22.664
you sly old fox.

01:07:24.123 --> 01:07:25.500
Oh!

01:07:26.668 --> 01:07:27.965
Oh, he got me.

01:07:28.127 --> 01:07:29.754
Hooray! We're home.

01:07:29.921 --> 01:07:31.923
Wait for me, wait for me!

01:07:32.090 --> 01:07:35.310
Me first, me first!

01:07:36.803 --> 01:07:39.056
- It's locked.
- Come on.

01:07:39.222 --> 01:07:41.145
Let's all start meowing.

01:07:45.353 --> 01:07:47.355
- It can't be them.
- The kittens.

01:07:49.482 --> 01:07:51.359
Uh, why?

01:07:54.946 --> 01:07:57.620
Don't come in!

01:07:59.200 --> 01:08:00.702
Go away!

01:08:00.868 --> 01:08:04.372
- Away!
- Look, there's Roquefort.

01:08:04.539 --> 01:08:06.291
Hi, Roquefort!

01:08:06.457 --> 01:08:08.084
He's glad to see us.

01:08:08.251 --> 01:08:12.176
I don't know what to say.

01:08:13.047 --> 01:08:14.924
I only wish that I...

01:08:15.091 --> 01:08:20.188
Maybe just a short, sweet
goodbye would be easiest.

01:08:20.345 --> 01:08:24.647
I'll never forget you,
Thomas O'Malley.

01:08:26.685 --> 01:08:28.233
Bye.

01:08:28.395 --> 01:08:29.898
So long, baby.

01:08:30.064 --> 01:08:33.738
Don't come in. Look out for Edgar!

01:08:41.576 --> 01:08:44.420
Duchess, wherever have you been?

01:08:44.578 --> 01:08:46.331
Look out for the...

01:08:46.497 --> 01:08:49.546
sack.

01:08:49.709 --> 01:08:54.555
Well... guess they won't
need me any more.

01:08:55.715 --> 01:08:57.763
You came back?

01:08:59.510 --> 01:09:00.886
It just isn't fair.

01:09:01.054 --> 01:09:03.807
Edgar? Edgar, come quickly.

01:09:03.973 --> 01:09:06.772
Coming, Madame, coming.

01:09:06.934 --> 01:09:10.108
I'll take care of you later.

01:09:10.270 --> 01:09:12.113
Oh, Edgar, they're back.

01:09:12.273 --> 01:09:15.777
I heard them. Hurry,
hurry, let them in.

01:09:16.611 --> 01:09:19.911
Duchess? Kittens?

01:09:20.782 --> 01:09:22.625
Come here, my darlings.

01:09:22.783 --> 01:09:24.127
Where are you?

01:09:24.285 --> 01:09:27.459
- Come on.
- Uh, allow me, Madame.

01:09:28.706 --> 01:09:33.462
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty,
kitty, kitty, kitty.

01:09:33.627 --> 01:09:35.470
His name is O... what?

01:09:35.630 --> 01:09:37.758
His name is O'Malley. O'Malley.

01:09:37.924 --> 01:09:40.051
Abraham de Lacy, Giuseppe Casey...

01:09:40.218 --> 01:09:43.017
Oh, never mind. Just run,
move, go get him!

01:09:43.179 --> 01:09:44.977
Yes, yes, I'm on my way.

01:09:45.139 --> 01:09:47.813
I told you it was Edgar.

01:09:47.975 --> 01:09:50.273
Aw, shut up, Toulouse.

01:09:50.435 --> 01:09:52.313
Oh, it's no use, Edgar.

01:09:52.479 --> 01:09:57.577
I'm afraid it was just the
imagination of an old lady.

01:09:57.735 --> 01:10:01.160
But I was so sure
that I heard them.

01:10:01.322 --> 01:10:03.620
I'm so sorry, Madame.

01:10:12.500 --> 01:10:14.548
Mr. O'Malley!

01:10:18.214 --> 01:10:20.637
Hey, stop!

01:10:20.800 --> 01:10:23.974
Duchess. Kittens. In trouble.

01:10:24.137 --> 01:10:25.354
Butler did it.

01:10:25.513 --> 01:10:27.265
Duchess and kittens in trouble?

01:10:27.432 --> 01:10:30.606
Look, you go get Scat Cat
and his gang of alley cats.

01:10:30.768 --> 01:10:32.691
Alley cats?

01:10:32.854 --> 01:10:34.322
But I'm a mouse.

01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:36.357
Look, I'm gonna need help.

01:10:36.524 --> 01:10:38.367
- You mean, you want me...?
- Move!

01:10:38.526 --> 01:10:41.871
Just tell 'em O'Malley sent you,
and you won't have a bit of trouble.

01:10:48.661 --> 01:10:50.254
No trouble, he said.

01:10:50.413 --> 01:10:53.713
Well, that's easy for...
for what's-his-name to say.

01:10:53.875 --> 01:10:57.379
He's got nine lives.
I've only got one.

01:11:01.883 --> 01:11:05.057
What's a little swinger like you
doing on our side of town?

01:11:05.219 --> 01:11:09.565
Oh, please, I was sent
here for help by a cat.

01:11:09.724 --> 01:11:12.227
This is outrageous. It's crazy.

01:11:18.232 --> 01:11:21.907
But honest! He told me
just to mention his name.

01:11:22.069 --> 01:11:25.414
So start mentioning name, rodent.

01:11:25.573 --> 01:11:27.246
Oh, now, wait a minute, fellas.

01:11:27.408 --> 01:11:29.661
Don't rush me.

01:11:29.827 --> 01:11:31.249
His name is O'Toole.

01:11:31.412 --> 01:11:34.086
I don't dig him. Strike one.

01:11:34.248 --> 01:11:37.047
Oh, oh... O'Brien.

01:11:37.210 --> 01:11:38.837
Strike two.

01:11:39.003 --> 01:11:40.596
Oh, boy.

01:11:40.755 --> 01:11:43.429
You believe me... don't you?

01:11:43.591 --> 01:11:45.264
Keep talkin', mousey.

01:11:45.426 --> 01:11:47.724
How about O...

01:11:47.887 --> 01:11:49.605
Grady?

01:11:49.764 --> 01:11:50.936
Huh?

01:11:51.098 --> 01:11:53.601
Mousey, you just struck out.

01:11:53.768 --> 01:11:56.772
Any last words?

01:11:56.938 --> 01:11:59.282
Why did I listen to
that O'Malley cat?

01:11:59.440 --> 01:12:01.784
- O'Malley?
- O'Malley?

01:12:01.943 --> 01:12:03.570
- O'Malley?
- Hold it, cats.

01:12:03.736 --> 01:12:05.283
This little guy's on the level.

01:12:05.446 --> 01:12:08.074
You're darn tootin'
I'm on the level.

01:12:08.241 --> 01:12:11.085
We didn't mean to
ruffle you, squeaky.

01:12:11.244 --> 01:12:13.963
Don't worry about me.
O'Malley needs help.

01:12:14.121 --> 01:12:16.123
Duchess and kittens are in trouble.

01:12:16.290 --> 01:12:18.258
Come on, cats, we gotta split.

01:12:18.417 --> 01:12:21.887
Hey, wait for me!
You don't know the way!

01:12:43.568 --> 01:12:45.696
Now, my little pesky pets,

01:12:45.862 --> 01:12:48.911
you're going to travel first class.

01:12:49.073 --> 01:12:51.747
In your own private compartment.

01:12:51.909 --> 01:12:54.628
All the way to Timbuktu.

01:12:54.787 --> 01:12:58.917
And this time...
you'll never come back.

01:12:59.083 --> 01:13:01.632
Oh, no, we've got to hurry.

01:13:01.794 --> 01:13:04.673
The baggage truck will
be here any moment now.

01:13:10.011 --> 01:13:11.479
Ooh!

01:13:30.031 --> 01:13:33.001
Whoo-hoo. Oww!

01:14:01.437 --> 01:14:03.360
Over there. They're in the trunk.

01:14:16.285 --> 01:14:17.753
Quiet!

01:14:25.378 --> 01:14:27.221
Everybody out of here, fast.

01:14:29.966 --> 01:14:34.062
You are going to Timbuktu,

01:14:34.220 --> 01:14:37.690
if it's the last thing I do.

01:15:03.791 --> 01:15:06.135
Well, Mac, this must
be the trunk, eh?

01:15:06.293 --> 01:15:10.048
Yup. And she goes all
the way to Timbuktu.

01:15:10.756 --> 01:15:12.804
Heave-ho.

01:15:36.490 --> 01:15:39.585
Now, my pets,
a little closer together.

01:15:39.744 --> 01:15:42.088
Good. Good.

01:15:42.246 --> 01:15:44.840
Look, Georges. What do you think?

01:15:44.999 --> 01:15:47.843
Very good, very good.

01:15:48.002 --> 01:15:50.096
But I think we should
get on with the will.

01:15:50.254 --> 01:15:54.009
Yes, yes, of course, but
you know what to do.

01:15:54.175 --> 01:15:56.769
Very well. Scratch one butler.

01:15:56.927 --> 01:16:01.182
You know, Georges, if Edgar had
only known about the will,

01:16:01.348 --> 01:16:04.773
I'm sure he never would have left.

01:16:04.935 --> 01:16:08.109
Duchess, it's wonderful
to have you all back.

01:16:08.272 --> 01:16:11.526
And I think this young
man is very handsome.

01:16:11.692 --> 01:16:13.786
Shall we keep him in the family?

01:16:16.614 --> 01:16:18.491
Of course we will.

01:16:18.657 --> 01:16:21.376
We need a man around the house.

01:16:21.535 --> 01:16:24.459
And, Georges, we must
be sure to provide

01:16:24.622 --> 01:16:26.920
for their future little ones.

01:16:27.083 --> 01:16:30.132
Of course. The more the merrier.

01:16:31.962 --> 01:16:33.805
Now, don't move.

01:16:33.964 --> 01:16:35.511
Smile.

01:16:37.051 --> 01:16:38.553
Say "cheese".

01:16:39.303 --> 01:16:41.021
Did somebody say "cheese"?

01:16:42.139 --> 01:16:43.356
Thank you.

01:16:43.516 --> 01:16:45.314
Now, run along downstairs.

01:16:45.476 --> 01:16:47.444
There's a surprise for you.

01:16:54.568 --> 01:16:56.741
Adelaide, what's that music?

01:16:56.904 --> 01:17:00.033
Sounds like a gang
of swinging hepcats.

01:17:00.199 --> 01:17:02.748
That's exactly what
they are, Georges.

01:17:02.910 --> 01:17:05.914
They're the start of
my new foundation.

01:17:06.080 --> 01:17:07.502
What foundation?

01:17:07.665 --> 01:17:12.045
