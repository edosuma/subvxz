every time I called?

Okay.

08:02.003 --> 08:03.526
This is for you.

08:09.532 --> 08:11.142
Your mom told me

08:11.186 --> 08:12.883
that you're really
into archeology.

08:14.537 --> 08:21.109
This is the Navajo tribes'"stone of life".

08:21.152 --> 08:23.764
It's the only "object"they really assign any value to

08:23.807 --> 08:26.418
outside of its utility.

08:26.462 --> 08:29.117

08:29.160 --> 08:31.859
the upside-downcrescent moon shape?

08:31.902 --> 08:34.557
It's called a 'Naja'
by the Navajo,

08:34.601 --> 08:39.780
but [chuckles] it's actuallyMoorish in origin!

08:39.823 --> 08:46.569
It represents the Phoeniciangoddess of fertility.

08:46.613 --> 08:49.529

and Eastern world

all the way back to the verybeginning of civilization.

How was camp?

10:50.911 --> 10:52.521
-[John] Yeah?
-Yeah.

10:52.564 --> 10:55.002

11:00.964 --> 11:02.531
I will let you
take that one.

11:02.574 --> 11:06.709
Well, uh, I-I came out
early this year

11:06.753 --> 11:10.495
because some work needed
to be done to the back deck.

11:10.539 --> 11:11.671
I swear!

11:13.020 --> 11:17.067
Anyways, I was outside
writing on the porch one day

11:17.111 --> 11:20.897
when John just
kind of appeared!

11:20.941 --> 11:24.727
[laughs] I--I've been
at the Lake all year.

11:24.771 --> 11:27.643
I, uh, I'm studying
a few species here.

11:27.687 --> 11:29.514
He's an aquatic geneticist!

11:29.558 --> 11:31.516
-Wait, really?
-[John] Hm-mm. Yeah.

11:31.560 --> 11:33.388
I'm part of
a small research team.

11:33.431 --> 11:35.651
We're sort of scattered
around the region here.

11:35.695 --> 11:37.261
What are you researching?

11:37.305 --> 11:39.089
[John]
Mostly freshwater animals.

11:39.133 --> 11:41.135
We're trying to solve
a problem in nature.

11:41.178 --> 11:43.485
Hm-mm. Libs! [indistinct].

11:43.528 --> 11:45.008
What problem?

11:45.052 --> 11:46.053
Well

11:49.186 --> 11:51.319
Can I borrow this, please?

11:51.362 --> 11:53.887
-Of course.
-[John chuckles]

11:53.930 --> 11:56.541
So the earth hasa finite amount of freshwater.

11:56.585 --> 11:57.934
[water gurgles]

11:57.978 --> 12:04.027
In fact, only 2.5%
of the Earth's water is fresh,

12:04.071 --> 12:06.464
leaving 97.5%

12:06.508 --> 12:09.641
-[clanking]
-as salt water.

12:09.685 --> 12:14.646
And within those freshwater
ponds and streams,

12:14.690 --> 12:17.737
and glaciers,
many, many species live.

12:17.780 --> 12:21.044
Unfortunately,
due to continual increase

12:21.088 --> 12:22.567
in the Earth's temperature,

12:22.611 --> 12:26.528
there isn't enough rain tosupply these freshwater systems.

12:26.571 --> 12:32.969
And there's more evaporation
in the oceans leaving a planet

12:33.013 --> 12:34.536
[clanking]

12:34.579 --> 12:36.494
with an overall
increasing level

12:36.538 --> 12:38.583
[clanking]

12:38.627 --> 12:39.628
of salinity.

12:40.934 --> 12:44.938
And now,
some of the species,

12:44.981 --> 12:49.812
well, they can't survivein such a rapidly changing world

12:49.856 --> 12:53.816
without some major adaptation.

12:53.860 --> 13:01.868
So, I am here
to speed up Mother Nature.

13:03.913 --> 13:05.262
And

13:07.961 --> 13:10.137
hopefully

13:10.180 --> 13:11.616
in the end

13:11.660 --> 13:14.576
[water flowing]

13:14.619 --> 13:18.754
make it
so that certain species

13:18.798 --> 13:22.105
can survive
in a saltwater world.

13:23.715 --> 13:26.327
[Michelle breathes deeply]

13:29.678 --> 13:33.290
Hm-mm. So, basically,
he's saving the world.

13:33.334 --> 13:34.422
[John] Oh, come on.

13:34.465 --> 13:36.293
I'm definitely not. [laughs]

13:58.228 --> 13:59.621

13:59.664 --> 14:01.405
Sorry. [coughs]

14:01.449 --> 14:03.625
Ah, I coughed up
a lung there.

14:03.668 --> 14:04.974
You know that phrase.

14:05.018 --> 14:07.107

-Honey, honey.

[door hinges squeak]

17:04.327 --> 17:05.850
[door closes]

17:11.073 --> 17:12.988
[Libby breathes deeply]

17:16.078 --> 17:18.254
-[banging]
-[Libby breathes deeply]

17:20.996 --> 17:22.258
[Michelle giggles and inhales]

17:22.302 --> 17:23.999
[John] Oh, I like things
that are kind of wet.

17:24.043 --> 17:25.044
-Oh, yeah.
-[John] Hm-mm.

17:25.087 --> 17:26.436
You're evil. [laughs]

17:26.480 --> 17:27.611
[indistinct]. What?

17:27.655 --> 17:29.135
[Michelle]
[giggles] No, I didn't.

17:29.178 --> 17:30.136
[John chuckles]

17:30.179 --> 17:33.487
[giggles] Mm.
Scratch my arm.

17:33.530 --> 17:34.531
Hm...mm.

17:38.492 --> 17:40.146
Mm-hm.

17:40.189 --> 17:43.149
-[far counter bangs]
-Oh. [shocked]

17:43.192 --> 17:44.454
Morning, sunshine!

17:44.498 --> 17:46.108
Morning.

17:46.152 --> 17:48.110
How'd you sleep?

17:48.154 --> 17:50.025
Well, thanks.

17:50.069 --> 17:51.418
You want some breakfast?

17:51.461 --> 17:54.464
I was thinking we could
go for a hike later?

17:54.508 --> 17:55.596
[chuckles] Mom?

17:55.639 --> 17:57.076
[Michelle] What?

17:57.119 --> 17:58.686
It's the 28th.

17:58.729 --> 18:00.209
Okay

18:00.253 --> 18:01.645
August 28th!

18:03.691 --> 18:06.650
Oh. [chuckles]
We can go after breakfast.

18:11.438 --> 18:12.482
Can John come?

18:14.093 --> 18:17.705
Ahhh I-I don't know.

18:17.748 --> 18:19.968
Okay, fine. Just us two.

18:20.011 --> 18:22.884
[breathes deeply]
I'll explain later. Hm.

18:22.927 --> 18:24.277
-It's fine.
-[both kiss]

18:24.320 --> 18:26.061
[Michelle] I'm gonna
make you some breakfast.

18:26.105 --> 18:28.368
-[both kiss]
-You'll love it.

18:28.411 --> 18:30.326
[heavy footsteps]

18:35.114 --> 18:37.377
[birds chirping]

18:40.206 --> 18:41.685
So, what do you think
of John?

18:43.644 --> 18:45.080
Mom.

18:45.124 --> 18:46.473
Ugh.

18:46.516 --> 18:48.692
It's important to me
that you like him.

18:51.826 --> 18:53.828
[sighs deeply]

18:53.871 --> 18:56.135
[capsules clanking]

19:17.330 --> 19:18.853
I don't have
anything this year.

19:21.464 --> 19:22.465
Fine.

19:23.945 --> 19:24.946
What about Grandpa?

19:26.774 --> 19:27.862
Mom!

19:27.905 --> 19:29.733
It's been nine years, Libs!

19:29.777 --> 19:30.952
So?

19:30.995 --> 19:32.562
Alright. I'm gonna
go back to the house.

19:32.606 --> 19:35.348
Fine. You never gave a shit,anyways so--

19:37.480 --> 19:38.525
Hey!

19:38.568 --> 19:40.048
Hey, what?

19:40.091 --> 19:42.355
You never haveanything nice for him.

19:42.398 --> 19:44.226
And one year, you gave hima roll of toilet paper!

19:44.270 --> 19:47.925
[laughs] That was funny!
He was gassy!

19:47.969 --> 19:49.536
Just go play
with your boyfriend.

19:54.062 --> 19:56.543
Hm. I think I will.

19:56.586 --> 19:58.109
No wonder
he gave me the house.

19:59.546 --> 20:00.851
Excuse me?

20:02.984 --> 20:06.030
He gave you the house
because he loved you!

20:06.074 --> 20:09.295
He loved you, Libby,
more than he ever loved me.

20:09.338 --> 20:10.339
Yeah.That's kind of my point.

20:10.383 --> 20:12.036
No. No, Libby.
You don't get it.

20:12.080 --> 20:14.082
He <i>never</i>loved me.

20:14.125 --> 20:17.868
You wanna know why I don't
give him a note every year?

20:17.912 --> 20:19.000
You want to know why?

20:20.175 --> 20:21.872
Because after he died,

20:21.916 --> 20:24.179
and I was cleaning out
this shithole house,

20:24.223 --> 20:27.269
I found his divorce
agreement to Grandma.

20:27.313 --> 20:29.184
He wrote to the lawyers
saying,

20:29.228 --> 20:32.318
"She can have Michelle,
I'll take Marc."

20:34.494 --> 20:35.495
That.

20:36.931 --> 20:38.237
That was the last note.

20:39.412 --> 20:41.240
That was the only note.

20:41.283 --> 20:44.199
[heavy footsteps]

20:51.424 --> 20:54.514
[insects chirping]

21:11.531 --> 21:12.880
[gasps] Ow!

21:14.447 --> 21:15.926
Ow! [groans softly]

21:15.970 --> 21:18.320
[breathing deeply]

21:18.364 --> 21:19.800
[John] No. Stop! Stop! Stop!

21:21.367 --> 21:22.803
That's a Scolopendra!

21:23.978 --> 21:25.588
They're really rare!

21:25.632 --> 21:26.850
[gasps]

21:31.290 --> 21:32.378
Careful.

21:34.118 --> 21:35.337
Let's get back in there.

21:35.381 --> 21:37.426
Alright, come on.

21:37.470 --> 21:38.775
It bit me!

21:40.386 --> 21:44.912
Well, I would guess, ah

21:47.175 --> 21:49.220
It was protecting its offspring.

21:51.919 --> 21:53.050
There we--

21:53.094 --> 21:54.835
Sorry, I didn't know
it was doing that.

21:56.489 --> 21:58.273
That's all right.

21:58.317 --> 22:00.014
[Libby breathes deeply]

22:01.624 --> 22:03.844
[John breathes deeply]

22:03.887 --> 22:05.236
Where did she get you?

22:06.412 --> 22:07.413
Right here.

22:07.456 --> 22:08.675
[John] Let me see.

22:11.286 --> 22:12.374
Whoa!I don't want to scare you,

22:12.418 --> 22:14.071
but their bite is venomous.

22:31.959 --> 22:33.656
Looks like
you're gonna be okay.

22:35.702 --> 22:38.618
Just put some ice on itso it doesn't swell, okay?

22:38.661 --> 22:39.706
Okay.

22:43.710 --> 22:45.581
What were you doing out here?

22:45.625 --> 22:48.279
Um, I like to come out here
after it rains.

22:49.585 --> 22:52.240
See if anything gets unearthed.

22:52.283 --> 22:54.329
[water splashing]

22:55.896 --> 22:57.158
You?

22:59.465 --> 23:01.162
Came to check on you, actually.

23:02.859 --> 23:04.078
Oh.

23:05.471 --> 23:06.733
Everything okay?

23:08.256 --> 23:10.040
Yeah. Fine.

23:10.084 --> 23:11.433
Hm-mm.

23:14.044 --> 23:16.395
I know it's not really
my business, but, uh

23:18.353 --> 23:20.007
your Mom came back
pretty upset.

23:23.750 --> 23:24.881
Oh.

23:28.668 --> 23:32.280
I hope it's nothing
with me being here.

23:35.588 --> 23:37.894
Maybe I should take off.

23:37.938 --> 23:39.461
Our team's almost done
around here.

23:39.505 --> 23:41.420
I can finish up at home.

23:42.551 --> 23:44.205
I don't want to cause
a rift between you two.

23:45.859 --> 23:48.035
I know how much
she loves you.

23:48.078 --> 23:51.821
[chuckles] You know,
the way she described you,

23:51.865 --> 23:53.475
the way she talked
about you

23:55.912 --> 23:57.740
it's what made me
fall in love with her.

24:05.008 --> 24:06.183
You love her?

24:08.621 --> 24:09.883
Very, very much.

24:13.103 --> 24:15.279
Well, I'll be in the basement
packing up my stuff.

24:16.759 --> 24:19.893
Oh, I have some of my things
down there for the low light.

24:19.936 --> 24:21.851
Sorry, I should
I should have told you.

24:21.895 --> 24:23.157
It's okay.

24:25.681 --> 24:27.074
You know, you should stay.

24:30.904 --> 24:32.949
I'll go talk to her.

24:32.993 --> 24:36.692
[John] Ah, I would maybe
give her a little bit.

24:36.736 --> 24:38.955
Last I checked,
she wasn't feeling real great.

24:48.095 --> 24:50.053
[loud whisper] Mom?

24:50.097 --> 24:52.534
[door hinges squeak]

25:00.847 --> 25:02.022
Ma?

25:02.065 --> 25:03.371
Hm-mm.

25:09.725 --> 25:11.074
[Michelle]
I'm not drinking.

25:13.076 --> 25:15.252
I've been good this summer.
I swear.

25:15.296 --> 25:17.646
[deep sigh] Hm.

25:19.779 --> 25:21.258
Ah.

25:25.262 --> 25:27.874
[breathes deeply]

25:30.006 --> 25:31.138
What's wrong?

25:31.181 --> 25:32.922
[Michelle]Ah. My stomach.

25:34.184 --> 25:35.490
Must've been my cooking.

25:36.622 --> 25:37.927
[chuckles]

25:43.629 --> 25:46.370
I'm sorry, about before.

25:47.676 --> 25:49.678
I didn't know, so

25:49.722 --> 25:51.462
It's okay, baby girl.

25:53.203 --> 25:54.727
I'm sorry I told you.

25:56.685 --> 25:58.774
I know Pop-pop
meant a lot to you.

26:00.080 --> 26:01.516
This doesn't change that.

26:05.041 --> 26:07.261
Did you find anything cool?

26:07.304 --> 26:08.610
-Sort of.
-[Michelle] Hm.

26:09.742 --> 26:11.134
You should show John!

26:12.396 --> 26:14.268
I think you twohave a lot in common.

26:16.792 --> 26:19.752
[inhales deeply]

26:19.795 --> 26:21.710
Libs, there's somethingI got to tell you

26:21.754 --> 26:24.365
and I don't want youto freak out.

26:26.628 --> 26:27.716
Okay.

26:28.978 --> 26:30.110
Okay

26:30.153 --> 26:31.677
Ah, well

26:34.984 --> 26:39.075
John asked me to marry him,and I said "yes." [chuckles]

26:39.119 --> 26:40.816
Well, "hell, yes"to be exact.

26:40.860 --> 26:42.775
[chuckles]

26:42.818 --> 26:44.385
What?

26:44.428 --> 26:46.561
I love him, Libby.

26:46.605 --> 26:48.215
I love him so much.

26:48.258 --> 26:50.217
So, so much.

26:50.260 --> 26:52.306
He's amazing.

26:52.349 --> 26:53.481
And I know you'll love him too.

26:53.524 --> 26:55.091
I promise you will.

26:57.572 --> 26:59.879
It's important to me
that you're okay with this.

27:01.271 --> 27:03.447
I need you to be okay,baby girl. [exhales]

27:05.319 --> 27:06.799
Please don't call me that.

27:08.844 --> 27:10.237
Okay.

27:14.502 --> 27:15.895
I'm happy for you guys.

27:17.723 --> 27:18.854
I love you, Mom.

27:18.898 --> 27:19.942
I want you to be happy.

27:23.511 --> 27:26.645
Oh, I love you, baby--
I love you, Libs!

27:27.820 --> 27:29.256
Thank you,
thank you, thank you.

27:30.953 --> 27:33.564
[inhales deeply]
[chuckles]

27:35.392 --> 27:37.090
Just one more thing.

27:37.133 --> 27:38.787
Wh-what?

27:38.831 --> 27:41.921
John doesn't really know
that I'm 42.

27:41.964 --> 27:42.965
What do you mean?

27:44.575 --> 27:48.318
He thinks I'm 35?

27:48.362 --> 27:49.319
Mom! That so--

27:49.363 --> 27:50.712
[Michelle] I know,I know, I know!

27:50.756 --> 27:53.236
I'm-I'm gonna tell him.
I-I've been meaning to, just

27:56.283 --> 27:58.546
I-I can't lose him, Libs.

28:00.113 --> 28:02.289
I just, I can't.

28:02.332 --> 28:03.682
Hey, you won't.

28:05.248 --> 28:06.685
You're incredible, so

28:07.860 --> 28:09.644
[Michelle sighs]

28:10.645 --> 28:12.125
Hey

28:14.867 --> 28:16.129
I gotta-- I should

28:16.172 --> 28:18.914
I should clean up. Yeah.

28:18.958 --> 28:20.089
-Yeah.
-[Libby clears throat]

28:42.372 --> 28:43.939
[zipper screeching open]

29:23.109 --> 29:25.328
[Libby breathes deeply]

30:01.277 --> 30:03.366
[door hinges squeak]

30:17.293 --> 30:18.425
[John] Hello?

30:18.468 --> 30:20.035
[Libby] Ah. It's me.

30:20.079 --> 30:21.645
[John] Oh, hey!

30:21.689 --> 30:24.126
But, turn that light off, yeah,I'll-I'll come and get you.

30:31.917 --> 30:35.094
Hey, what an awesome surprise!

30:36.660 --> 30:38.662
I tried knocking.
I'm really sorry.

30:38.706 --> 30:40.055
Oh, it's okay.

30:40.099 --> 30:42.101
I'll be, uh, the humidifiers,they get really loud,

30:42.144 --> 30:45.147
so sometimes I don't hear.

30:45.191 --> 30:46.757
How's your Mom?

30:46.801 --> 30:49.412
[gasps] She's fine. Yeah.

30:49.456 --> 30:50.631
[John] Good.

30:50.674 --> 30:53.416
Um, I brought you
something to drink, so

30:53.460 --> 30:54.765
Thank you.

30:54.809 --> 30:58.595
Ah, I can't, uh,I can't do the sodium.

31:00.510 --> 31:03.905
Bad ticker.
But thank you.

31:03.949 --> 31:05.776
Hm-mm.
[whispers] Yeah.

31:05.820 --> 31:07.300
[John] So, uh

31:09.650 --> 31:11.826
you want to check out
my craziness?

31:18.528 --> 31:20.269
Right this way.Come here.

31:23.794 --> 31:25.753
[water gurgling]

31:28.016 --> 31:29.539
Uhh.

31:29.583 --> 31:31.628
What are those?

31:31.672 --> 31:34.022
[smirks] Lampreys.

31:34.066 --> 31:35.284
[Libby] Really?

31:35.328 --> 31:37.896
Yeah. You're familiar?

31:38.984 --> 31:40.072
Yeah. Slightly.

31:41.464 --> 31:42.770
I figured you might be.

31:44.119 --> 31:47.122
These little guys
are 360 million years old.

31:48.515 --> 31:50.169
Right up your alley!

31:50.212 --> 31:51.648
Ah, yeah. They're, um

31:51.692 --> 31:53.607
mentioned a lot
in the fossil record.

31:53.650 --> 31:54.695
Hm-mm.

31:56.001 --> 31:57.916
Yeah, these little guys
have survived it all.

31:59.482 --> 32:01.267
Meteors

32:01.310 --> 32:03.443
ice ages

32:03.486 --> 32:06.272
ever increasing and decreasing
salinity levels.

32:08.013 --> 32:11.625
In fact, they are
the only aquatic species

32:11.668 --> 32:15.020
to be found in the fresh
and saltwater records.

32:15.063 --> 32:16.412
Huh.

32:16.456 --> 32:18.284
They're parasitic.

32:18.327 --> 32:21.243
See the mouths? The teeth?

32:21.287 --> 32:23.985
They latch onto their prey.

32:24.029 --> 32:27.336
And they can adapt
to their host.

32:28.816 --> 32:32.515
So, even if they encounter
anadromous species

32:32.559 --> 32:37.085
like Smelt,
or Salmon, or Bass,

32:37.129 --> 32:38.869
spawning
in a freshwater pool,

32:38.913 --> 32:43.657
or stream, or river,
they can attach

32:43.700 --> 32:45.441
and then adapt.

32:45.485 --> 32:49.402
So even if they
end up in the sea

32:49.445 --> 32:50.577
they'll survive.

32:53.710 --> 32:56.017
No other species on Earth

32:56.061 --> 32:57.323
that can do that.

32:58.889 --> 33:00.152
Not one.

33:02.415 --> 33:04.852
[water bubbing]

33:12.207 --> 33:13.687
It's beautiful.

33:18.909 --> 33:20.085
Beautiful?

33:22.565 --> 33:24.480
Hm-mm. [chuckles]

33:26.178 --> 33:27.266
Yeah.

33:30.443 --> 33:32.053
You're kind of a-a weird dude.

33:32.097 --> 33:33.707
[John laughs]

33:35.796 --> 33:37.885
Yeah, I guess I am.

33:39.321 --> 33:40.583
But, I mean,

33:40.627 --> 33:42.020
weird is cool, right?

33:46.111 --> 33:47.373
Yeah.

33:52.465 --> 33:54.075
[Libby] Um

33:54.119 --> 33:56.773
So, I heard that you and
my mom are getting married?

34:00.603 --> 34:01.996
Yeah, yeah. Ah

34:05.434 --> 34:06.957
She told you, huh?

34:07.001 --> 34:08.916
Yep.

34:08.959 --> 34:10.439
Yeah, we are.

34:13.877 --> 34:16.271
Libby, she's very,
very special to me.

34:18.273 --> 34:19.622
Good.

34:21.189 --> 34:22.538
[John chuckles]

34:23.757 --> 34:25.759
We have to celebrate!

34:25.802 --> 34:27.152
You can have a party!

34:27.195 --> 34:28.588
You can invite
some of your girlfriends.

34:28.631 --> 34:29.676
Ah, I don't-- [chuckles]

34:29.719 --> 34:31.373
Maybe. [chuckles]

34:33.462 --> 34:35.029
Should I go check on your mom?
Or-or--

34:35.073 --> 34:37.379
Nah, no, no.
She's um, she's fine.

34:37.423 --> 34:39.468
Just let her sleep.

34:39.512 --> 34:41.122
[John] Okay.

34:41.166 --> 34:42.689
In that case

34:45.866 --> 34:48.129
you want to help me pull
some samples from the lake?

34:48.173 --> 34:50.131
[water bubbling]

34:51.915 --> 34:53.874
Oh, okay.

35:03.536 --> 35:04.972
How old are you?

35:06.626 --> 35:07.844
[John] How old do I look?

35:09.324 --> 35:10.282
[Libby] Twenty-five.

35:10.325 --> 35:12.501
Ho-oh, thank you.

35:12.545 --> 35:13.633
[Libby] Twenty-six?

35:14.938 --> 35:15.983
Thirty.

35:16.026 --> 35:17.245
Oh.

35:19.595 --> 35:21.293
Where did you go to school?

35:21.336 --> 35:25.253
Uh, a little, private school
that no one has ever heard of.

35:25.297 --> 35:27.777
It probably explainswhy I'm so well-funded.

35:27.821 --> 35:30.476
[boat groans]

35:32.347 --> 35:34.306
Can you hold my legs
for a second?

35:36.046 --> 35:37.135
Yep.

35:39.093 --> 35:40.050
[John] Right there.

35:40.094 --> 35:41.835
[water splashing]

35:41.878 --> 35:43.010
Come on.

35:45.143 --> 35:47.275
-Yeah.
-[cage thuds]

35:47.319 --> 35:49.625
Well, I'm applying
Early Decision

35:49.669 --> 35:51.149
to Cambridge next year.

35:52.411 --> 35:53.847
Really?

35:53.890 --> 35:55.805
[Libby] Yeah, I got, uh,
a perfect score on my PSATs

35:55.849 --> 35:57.590
and, um, my counselor says

35:57.633 --> 36:00.201
I'm probably gonna be
Valedictorian, so

36:00.245 --> 36:02.203
Libby, that's amazing!

36:02.247 --> 36:03.204
Thanks. [chuckles]

36:03.248 --> 36:04.684
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

36:04.727 --> 36:05.815
That's great.

36:05.859 --> 36:08.644
Yeah.
It's-it's really far but, um,

36:08.688 --> 36:11.865
the archeology programs thereare like the best in the world.

36:11.908 --> 36:13.432
-Yeah.
-And like the history there

36:13.475 --> 36:16.739
is just so awesome. So

36:19.351 --> 36:20.526
Very awesome.

36:20.569 --> 36:21.788
Hm-mm, thanks.

36:23.268 --> 36:24.530
Does your mom know?

36:25.792 --> 36:26.836
Kind of holding off on that.

36:26.880 --> 36:29.926
She's so attached.

36:29.970 --> 36:30.927
[John] Right.

36:30.971 --> 36:32.190
-Yeah.
-[John] Well

36:33.843 --> 36:35.018
Thank you. [giggles]

36:36.455 --> 36:38.892
Yeah, she wants me
to stay here,

36:38.935 --> 36:42.243
but the state programs
are so awful.

36:42.287 --> 36:43.505

I'm sorry!

I didn't want youto ruin your dress.

37:09.357 --> 37:10.619

Right?

37:24.503 --> 37:25.504
Hm-mm.

37:25.547 --> 37:27.680
This is totally normal.

What are you doing out here?

47:35.853 --> 47:38.290
I don't know.
I just woke up out here.

47:38.333 --> 47:39.726
Ah, I saw you!

47:39.769 --> 47:41.684
I saw you walk into the lake!

Libby, I should have
mentioned this earlier,

47:57.439 --> 47:58.832
and I'm really sorry.

48:00.921 --> 48:03.489
I suffer from somnambulism.

that I have done

an absolute catastrophe!

Except for my research.

It's the one time
that I-I like I work.

Okay, so you're going to havelike a little brother or sister.

55:00.471 --> 55:02.168
Well, hopefully,
not a little sister though.

55:02.211 --> 55:04.083
That'll be annoying. [gasps]
Oh, a little boy though.

55:04.126 --> 55:05.127
He's gonna have like his thing

55:05.171 --> 55:06.346

-Marley!

55:06.390 --> 55:07.216

be pretty cute.

55:07.260 --> 55:09.393
Filter. Right now.

55:09.436 --> 55:11.133

[Libby breathes deeply]

55:22.319 --> 55:24.103
Okay.

55:24.146 --> 55:29.456
[whispers] So, last night,I saw him walk into the lake.

55:29.500 --> 55:32.372
Like completelytowards this like,

55:32.416 --> 55:34.418
orange light at the bottom.

55:35.636 --> 55:37.072
Really?

55:37.116 --> 55:39.945
And I saw himdrink his own sweat--

55:39.988 --> 55:40.989
Ewwww!

55:43.165 --> 55:45.385
[whispers]And he grabbed me.

55:45.429 --> 55:46.647
What?

55:46.691 --> 55:48.214
Like Donald Trump,he grabbed me.

55:48.257 --> 55:50.129
Jesus.
Did you tell your mom?

55:50.172 --> 55:54.046
No! She's head-over-heelsin love with him.

55:54.089 --> 55:55.439
Like psycho-girlfriendin love with him.

55:55.482 --> 56:00.095
Like [breathes deeply]Jaime-Savard in love with him.

56:00.139 --> 56:01.880
Oh, God.

56:01.923 --> 56:03.490
Okay. Still,
you need to talk to her.

56:03.534 --> 56:05.710
Or call the cops!

56:05.753 --> 56:06.885
I know.

56:06.928 --> 56:11.063
Um hey, can youstay here tonight? Please.

56:11.106 --> 56:12.847
[inhales]
Okay, I'm going to sound

56:12.891 --> 56:14.980
like the worst friend ever,
but I can't.

56:15.023 --> 56:16.982
My Dad has this'Behind the Book' charity event,

56:17.025 --> 56:18.592
and he has me working
live stream

56:18.636 --> 56:20.638
'cause he just can't get
anything, right?

56:22.988 --> 56:24.293
But you should come.

56:24.337 --> 56:26.034
You need to get
out of this house.

56:27.688 --> 56:29.342
No, I can't leave her alone.

56:29.386 --> 56:30.691
Okay, okay.

56:30.735 --> 56:32.737
Well, what if I go up there
and tell Michelle?

56:36.044 --> 56:37.394
[whispers] I don't know.

56:37.437 --> 56:40.222
He didn't really grab me,but I was-I was bleeding.

56:40.266 --> 56:41.659
-Does that make me--
-Okay, no, Libs.

56:41.702 --> 56:43.225

58:28.417 --> 58:30.681
Marley left a while ago.

58:30.724 --> 58:31.986

[whispers] You're scared?

59:05.977 --> 59:06.978
Yeah.

59:08.196 --> 59:09.241
Did Marley talk to you?

59:09.284 --> 59:10.285
Yes!

59:10.329 --> 59:12.070
Why would you tell her that?

59:12.113 --> 59:13.071

59:29.000 --> 59:32.612
Every time I date someone,you come up with some BS.

59:32.656 --> 59:33.874
It was cute
when you were a kid.

59:33.918 --> 59:35.397
But, not anymore!

59:35.441 --> 59:38.879
I'm done putting my lifeon hold for your feelings.

If we're going to be a family,

59:59.683 --> 1:00:03.600
