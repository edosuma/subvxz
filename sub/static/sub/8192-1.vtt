05:10.769 --> 05:13.355
Ah, don't get me started
on that strudel-head.

05:13.439 --> 05:15.858
He went back to the old country
for the summer.

05:15.983 --> 05:18.360
Left me to run
the shop all by myself.

05:18.485 --> 05:20.321
Wanted to visit our mama.

05:38.672 --> 05:41.383
- Sorry, did I wake you?
- Hey, Charlie.

05:41.759 --> 05:45.262
- Hey, Coach. It's good to see you.
- Good to see you.

05:45.971 --> 05:47.222
We really missed you.

05:48.474 --> 05:51.060
For breakfast, my specialty:
Jan's hasen--

05:51.143 --> 05:53.520
- TOGETHER: Hasenpfeffer and eggs.
- Yeah.

05:53.604 --> 05:55.814
GORDON:
I thought I smelled something burning.

05:55.898 --> 05:57.900
I see you've met my new apprentice.

05:58.025 --> 06:00.861
Jan told me you did this job
when you were my age.

06:00.944 --> 06:03.947
- That's right. I hope he pays you more.
- You got paid?

06:04.031 --> 06:07.076
Eat, everybody, before
the hasenpfeffer gets cold.

06:21.298 --> 06:22.591
That was a good day.

06:23.050 --> 06:25.135
Look at Charlie. God, he's grown.

06:25.260 --> 06:26.720
Oh. They do that.

06:27.304 --> 06:31.058
Since his mother remarried,
he started spending a lot of time here.

06:31.558 --> 06:33.185
I just had to hire him.

06:33.977 --> 06:36.688
I should've kept in touch more.
But you are here now.

06:36.772 --> 06:38.065
So what's your plan?

06:38.357 --> 06:39.942
Have you talked to Ducksworth?

06:40.651 --> 06:44.113
No, no. I'm not a lawyer,
Jan, I'm a player.

06:44.738 --> 06:47.658
But your injury,
it requires rest and time.

06:47.741 --> 06:50.494
Yeah, time is something
I don't have a whole lot of.

06:50.577 --> 06:52.913
I was this close to the N.H.L., Jan.

06:53.247 --> 06:54.915
I was back in the game.

06:55.624 --> 06:57.418
And, man, I was alive.

06:58.168 --> 06:59.253
(GROANS)

06:59.920 --> 07:01.630
Have you thought about coaching?

07:01.880 --> 07:05.050
After all, you were
the Minnesota Miracle Man.

07:05.134 --> 07:08.262
Well, coaching the Ducks was one
of the best things in my life

07:08.345 --> 07:10.764
but I can't make a living
coaching Pee Wee hockey.

07:10.848 --> 07:12.975
Where there's a way,
there must be a will.

07:13.058 --> 07:16.520
My hockey suppliers tell me
Team U.S.A. is still without a coach

07:16.603 --> 07:18.689
for the Junior Goodwill Games.

07:19.231 --> 07:22.860
Sounds great. Give 'em a call for me, Jan.
Maybe I can sharpen their skates.

07:22.985 --> 07:24.653
Don't knock skate sharpening.

07:24.736 --> 07:29.074
I know. It's a great skill, Jan. But
I don't want to spend the rest of my life

07:29.199 --> 07:32.453
sharpening skates in this rinky-dink town.
I want something better.

07:33.954 --> 07:35.205
Something bigger.

07:41.462 --> 07:42.629
Whoa!

07:49.761 --> 07:52.514
- You don't have to do them right now.
- Oh, thanks.

07:52.598 --> 07:56.101
You have a customer. Go and help him.
Then come back and do them.

08:02.941 --> 08:04.818
- Can I help you?
- Oh!

08:04.902 --> 08:08.071
Oops, sorry.
Got away from me. Hi.

How's the knee?
I have a doctor in Los Angeles

08:20.292 --> 08:24.213
I want to take a look at it. He's doing
great things with baboon ligaments.

08:24.296 --> 08:25.714
Hendrix Hockey, huh?

08:26.131 --> 08:28.884
What exactly is it that
you want, Mr. Tibbles?

08:28.967 --> 08:30.302
I want you, Gordon.

08:30.886 --> 08:34.264
I want the next coach of Team U.S.A.
to become a household name.

08:34.347 --> 08:36.558
I want you to become
synonymous with winning

08:36.642 --> 08:38.769
and winning to become
synonymous with Hendrix.

08:38.852 --> 08:42.272
Er, wait a minute.
You're joking, right? I mean...

08:42.606 --> 08:45.192
- This is a joke.
- It's no joke.

08:48.362 --> 08:50.614
You want me to coach
Team U.S.A.?

pitching you for months.

08:53.200 --> 08:56.411

there was magic, and we--

And by we, I mean Hendrix Hockey,

08:58.497 --> 09:02.459

01:08:19.513 --> 01:08:21.932
My dad worked a lot
when I was a kid.

01:08:22.974 --> 01:08:27.270
So when he made it to a game, I wanted
so bad to score 100 goals for him.

01:08:28.438 --> 01:08:31.817
I spent half the game a nervous wreck,
my stomach in knots.

That's how I feel.

01:08:36.904 --> 01:08:41.618
Before he died, my dad told me
that his happiest times...

01:08:42.661 --> 01:08:45.831
were watching me skate on this pond
we had behind our house.

01:08:46.456 --> 01:08:49.209
He didn't need me
to score 100 goals for him.

01:08:50.502 --> 01:08:52.921
He was proud of me
because I was his son...

01:08:54.214 --> 01:08:55.799
and I did my best.

01:08:57.676 --> 01:08:59.719
I'm sure that's how
your dad feels.

01:09:01.763 --> 01:09:03.223
