<i> Previously on</i>
<i> "The American West"...</i>

00:11.166 --> 00:13.125
<i> in the wake</i>
<i> of the Civil War,</i>

00:13.166 --> 00:15.667
<i> the country is in turmoil.</i>

00:15.667 --> 00:17.667
<i> The South</i>
<i> is rising up again,</i>

00:17.667 --> 00:22.125
<i> led by ex-Confederate soldiers</i>
<i> like Jesse James...</i>

00:22.125 --> 00:24.208
I'm gonna make this right.

00:24.208 --> 00:25.542
<i> ...who takes his hatred</i>
<i> for the Union...</i>

00:25.542 --> 00:27.250
Everything in your vault.

00:27.250 --> 00:29.375
<i> ...and becomes an outlaw.</i>

00:31.709 --> 00:34.166
<i> Desperate</i>
<i> to unite the country,</i>

00:34.166 --> 00:37.083
<i> the government looks west,</i>

00:37.083 --> 00:39.583
<i> hoping that by settling</i>
<i> the frontier,</i>

00:39.583 --> 00:44.166
<i> America can put</i>
<i> their differences behind them.</i>

00:44.166 --> 00:48.208
<i> But as settlers head west,</i>
<i> they encounter Indians,</i>

00:48.208 --> 00:51.667
<i> like fierce Lakota warrior</i>
<i> Crazy Horse,</i>

00:51.667 --> 00:55.041
<i> who are prepared to defend</i>
<i> their land to the death.</i>

00:56.041 --> 00:57.291
<i> In response,</i>

00:57.291 --> 01:00.208
<i> head of the US Army,</i>
<i> Ulysses S. Grant,</i>

01:00.208 --> 01:02.333
<i> orders his most</i>
<i> aggressive officer,</i>

01:02.375 --> 01:06.333
<i> George Armstrong Custer,</i>
<i> to send a message.</i>

01:06.333 --> 01:07.792
Get the men ready.

01:07.792 --> 01:11.417
I wanna hit them
with everything we've got.

01:11.417 --> 01:14.125
<i> ( theme music playing )</i>

02:24.500 --> 02:27.417
Hup. Hyah!

02:27.417 --> 02:29.166
- ( gunfire )
- ( people shouting )

02:29.166 --> 02:30.625
Man:
<i> Fire!</i>

02:30.625 --> 02:32.208
Hyah!

02:36.208 --> 02:37.500
<i> ( whooping )</i>

02:44.333 --> 02:46.667
( horse whinnies )

02:57.417 --> 02:59.500
Hyah!

03:06.583 --> 03:09.500
Narrator:
<i> On November 27th, 1868,</i>

03:09.500 --> 03:12.709
<i> George Armstrong Custer</i>
<i> leads a brutal attack</i>

03:12.709 --> 03:16.625
<i> on an Indian camp</i>
<i> near the Washita River.</i>

03:18.166 --> 03:22.709
<i> An estimated</i>
<i> 150 Cheyenne are killed,</i>

03:22.709 --> 03:24.792
<i> and what remains</i>
<i> of their village</i>

03:24.792 --> 03:27.250
<i> is burned to the ground.</i>

03:32.208 --> 03:37.583
<i> It will come to be known</i>
<i> as the Washita Massacre.</i>

03:37.583 --> 03:40.542
Mark Lee Gardner:
<i> Custer splits his command up</i>
<i> into four battalions.</i>

03:45.291 --> 03:47.208
He wants to encircle
this village

03:47.208 --> 03:49.208
and make sure there's
no possibility of escape.

03:49.208 --> 03:52.333
<i> He burned the village,</i>
<i> burned their lodges.</i>

03:52.333 --> 03:55.417
<i> He killed 800 horses.</i>

03:55.417 --> 03:59.458
<i> It's a complete disaster for</i>
<i> this Southern Cheyenne tribe.</i>

04:04.834 --> 04:07.001
Narrator:
<i> In the press,</i>
<i> the attack is hailed</i>

04:07.001 --> 04:11.250
<i> as the first</i>
<i> significant American victory</i>
<i> in the Indian Wars</i>

04:11.250 --> 04:13.875
<i> and gives Custer the glory</i>
<i> he's been after</i>

04:13.875 --> 04:15.834
<i> since the Civil War.</i>

04:17.959 --> 04:21.500
Paul Hutton:
<i> For Custer, it was</i>
<i> another great victory.</i>

04:21.500 --> 04:23.750
<i> It assured his place</i>

04:23.750 --> 04:25.917
as the premier Indian fighter
in the United States

04:25.917 --> 04:29.291
and made him famous
once again.

04:29.291 --> 04:31.625
Narrator:
<i> Custer's mission</i>
<i> was to put an end</i>

04:31.625 --> 04:35.375
<i> to Indian attacks</i>
<i> in the West,</i>

04:35.375 --> 04:37.875
<i> but the fighting persists.</i>

04:53.917 --> 04:55.667
- ( groans )
-<i> ( Native Americans whooping )</i>

04:55.667 --> 04:58.417
- ( men shouting )
- ( gunfire )

05:15.667 --> 05:18.709
In hindsight,
I don't think the Indian Wars

05:18.709 --> 05:21.500
could have been avoided,
because in those days

05:21.500 --> 05:24.834
you settle scores
with fighting.

05:24.875 --> 05:28.875
<i> The West was to be conquered</i>
<i> by the strongest,</i>

05:28.875 --> 05:31.834
and the Indians
were great warriors, too.

05:34.001 --> 05:36.375
Narrator:
<i> As the violence continues,</i>

05:36.375 --> 05:39.417
<i> back in Washington,</i>
<i> there's hope.</i>

05:40.917 --> 05:44.875
<i> The country has just elected</i>
<i> a new president--</i>

05:44.875 --> 05:47.959
<i> former head</i>
<i> of the US Army,</i>

05:47.959 --> 05:50.417
<i> Ulysses S. Grant.</i>

05:50.417 --> 05:53.583
H.W. Brands:
<i> Grant was a very reluctant</i>
<i> political candidate.</i>

05:53.583 --> 05:55.709
People who wanted him
to run would say,

05:55.709 --> 05:58.625
"General Grant,
if you don't run,

05:58.625 --> 06:01.625
then the victories
that your soldiers won

06:01.625 --> 06:03.709
at such cost
on the battlefield

06:03.709 --> 06:07.333
<i> will be lost</i>
<i> in the realm of politics.</i>

06:07.333 --> 06:10.709
<i> We need your leadership</i>
<i> in the White House.</i>

06:10.709 --> 06:13.959
Only you
can bring this country
back together again."

06:16.458 --> 06:19.959
Our reports indicate
around 1,000 Indian lodges...

06:19.959 --> 06:22.542
Narrator:
<i> Up until now,</i>
<i> Grant has led the army</i>

06:22.542 --> 06:26.458
<i> in their fight to protect</i>
<i> settlers moving west.</i>

06:26.458 --> 06:29.959
<i> So as president,</i>
<i> one of his first</i>
<i> orders of business</i>

06:29.959 --> 06:32.000
<i> is to end the violence</i>
<i> with the Indians</i>

06:32.000 --> 06:35.000
<i> once and for all.</i>

06:35.000 --> 06:37.417
What's going through
the heads of Americans

06:37.417 --> 06:39.875
in dealing with
the Native Americans
in the 1860s

06:39.875 --> 06:43.834
<i> can be looked at</i>
<i> through Ulysses S. Grant.</i>

06:43.834 --> 06:46.959
<i> Settlers going out west</i>
<i> were getting killed,</i>

06:46.959 --> 06:51.375
<i> and his responsibility</i>
<i> is to protect American lives.</i>

06:51.375 --> 06:54.709
Here is a man
who is actually
disgusted by war,

06:54.709 --> 06:58.583
but there are lots of forces
within his own beloved army,

06:58.583 --> 07:02.500
<i> like William Tecumseh Sherman</i>
<i> who's in charge of the army,</i>

07:02.500 --> 07:05.125
who are pushing the policy of
"Let's get rid of them."

07:13.834 --> 07:16.125
Any Indian who reports
to the reservation

07:16.125 --> 07:18.709
will be fed, clothed,
and educated.

07:20.959 --> 07:25.458
All due respect, sir,
many of them don't
want that.

07:25.458 --> 07:28.709
A good number
will be more receptive
than you think.

07:30.041 --> 07:32.125
They will be
taught to farm.

07:32.125 --> 07:35.001
They will learn
Western culture.

07:35.001 --> 07:37.583
And those
that don't report?

07:37.583 --> 07:38.959
Do we consider them
hostiles?

07:38.959 --> 07:41.625
No, we don't.

07:42.834 --> 07:44.917
I didn't say it was
going to be easy.

07:46.834 --> 07:49.875
Nothing worth having is.

07:52.875 --> 07:55.834
Brands:
<i> Grant viewed the Indians with</i>
<i> considerably more compassion</i>

07:55.834 --> 07:57.959
<i> than many</i>
<i> of his contemporaries.</i>

07:57.959 --> 08:00.959
So instead
of driving the Indians
off of all of the land,

08:00.959 --> 08:02.917
instead of exterminating
the Indians

08:02.917 --> 08:05.792
as many people
of Grant's day advocated,

08:05.792 --> 08:09.792
<i> Grant said, "No, we need</i>
<i> to set aside territory</i>
<i> where they can live.</i>

08:09.792 --> 08:12.959
Territory for their uses
and not for settlers.

08:12.959 --> 08:15.583
Settlers are going
to have to stay off that."

08:15.583 --> 08:17.667
<i> The policy</i>
<i> of reservations.</i>

08:20.500 --> 08:21.875
Narrator:
<i> In the Great Plains,</i>

08:21.875 --> 08:24.500
<i> nearly 40,000</i>
<i> square miles of land</i>

08:24.500 --> 08:26.792
<i> are reserved</i>
<i> for the Lakota Sioux--</i>

08:26.792 --> 08:29.750
<i> roughly the size</i>
<i> of the state of Ohio.</i>

08:32.834 --> 08:35.625
<i> And the US government</i>
<i> makes a promise</i>

08:35.625 --> 08:39.083
<i> to never interfere</i>
<i> with the new Indian territory.</i>

08:42.041 --> 08:44.834
<i> Many Indians agree</i>
<i> to the peace treaty</i>

08:44.834 --> 08:47.083
<i> and move</i>
<i> onto the reservations.</i>

08:50.583 --> 08:54.041
<i> But some,</i>
<i> like Lakota warrior</i>
<i> Crazy Horse,</i>

08:54.083 --> 08:56.542
<i> refuse to give up</i>
<i> their way of life.</i>

08:59.792 --> 09:01.834
Robert Redford:
<i> If you're a nomadic hunter</i>
<i> and you're moving</i>

09:01.834 --> 09:03.750
<i> and you take away</i>
<i> that chance to move,</i>

09:03.750 --> 09:06.792
you can imagine
it's the beginning
of the end for you.

09:06.792 --> 09:08.208
And I imagine
they saw that coming,

09:08.208 --> 09:10.041
and they had
to fight against it.

09:12.542 --> 09:14.000
I don't blame them.

09:17.875 --> 09:21.750
Narrator:
<i> As Crazy Horse</i>
<i> continues to resist,</i>

09:21.750 --> 09:25.166
<i> he gets the attention</i>
<i> of one of the most respected</i>
<i> Lakota chiefs</i>

09:25.208 --> 09:27.917
<i> in the Great Plains.</i>

09:27.917 --> 09:30.750
<i> His name is Sitting Bull.</i>

09:33.500 --> 09:36.875
Karl Jacoby:
<i> Sitting Bull was known both</i>
<i> as a great spiritual guide</i>

09:36.875 --> 09:38.917
<i> and also someone who had</i>
<i> tremendous success</i>

09:38.917 --> 09:41.792
during warfare,
and he was much older,

09:41.792 --> 09:44.792
at least probably a decade
older than Crazy Horse,

09:44.792 --> 09:47.041
and in many respects
better established.

09:48.875 --> 09:50.542
Narrator:
<i> Sitting Bull knows</i>

09:50.542 --> 09:53.291
<i> his people need to form</i>
<i> a united front,</i>

09:53.291 --> 09:56.792
<i> so he calls a meeting</i>
<i> of Lakota leaders.</i>

10:01.959 --> 10:04.208
<i> ( crickets chirping )</i>

10:07.583 --> 10:10.750
( speaking Lakota )

10:54.750 --> 10:56.583
Narrator:
<i> While thousands</i>
<i> of other Indians</i>

10:56.583 --> 10:58.959
<i> continue to live</i>
<i> on reservations,</i>

10:58.959 --> 11:02.834
<i> Sitting Bull, Crazy Horse,</i>
<i> and their followers refuse.</i>

11:05.166 --> 11:07.792
<i> But they also agree</i>
<i> not to fight,</i>

11:07.834 --> 11:10.667
<i> and a fragile peace</i>
<i> is established.</i>

11:12.709 --> 11:14.625
( screeching )

11:14.625 --> 11:19.333
<i> As America gets back</i>
<i> to settling the frontier,</i>

11:19.333 --> 11:23.208
<i> a new kind</i>
<i> of businessman emerges</i>

11:23.208 --> 11:26.625
<i> who sees only one thing</i>
<i> in the West--</i>

11:26.625 --> 11:29.291
<i> the opportunity</i>
<i> to make a fortune.</i>

11:33.875 --> 11:36.709
Narrator:
<i> President Grant has made peace</i>
<i> with the Indians...</i>

11:40.625 --> 11:42.750
<i> allowing the country</i>
<i> to move forward</i>

11:42.750 --> 11:44.917
<i> with its plan</i>
<i> of settling the West.</i>

11:57.041 --> 12:00.083
Sir, here's
the latest track map.

12:00.083 --> 12:01.917
Narrator:
<i> A new breed of businessman</i>

12:01.917 --> 12:04.625
<i> is taking full advantage</i>
<i> of the westward expansion.</i>

12:04.625 --> 12:06.959
We build north to Columbus,
then south to Grand Island,

12:06.959 --> 12:09.417
and then we go out
the North Platte route

12:09.417 --> 12:12.166
when we can no longer
reasonably delay that.

12:12.166 --> 12:13.834
But, sir, that would add
hundreds of miles

12:13.834 --> 12:15.792
of unnecessary track.

12:15.792 --> 12:18.125
The government pays us
for each mile of track
we complete.

12:18.125 --> 12:20.291
Why would we design
a shorter route?

12:21.208 --> 12:23.208
- Well, sir--
- Get it done.

12:25.834 --> 12:27.417
Yes, sir.

12:33.250 --> 12:36.834
Narrator:
<i> Thomas Durant, president</i>
<i> of the Union Pacific Railroad,</i>

12:36.834 --> 12:40.917
<i> has turned progress</i>
<i> into millions in profits.</i>

12:40.917 --> 12:42.417
Eisenbach:
<i> A guy like Durant,</i>

12:42.417 --> 12:45.750
<i> he's facing off against</i>
<i> other railroad barons,</i>

12:45.750 --> 12:49.750
guys who didn't think twice
about cutting a corner here

12:49.750 --> 12:53.041
in order to put your nose
in the dirt.

12:53.041 --> 12:55.250
<i> If you weren't</i>
<i> being ruthless,</i>

12:55.250 --> 12:58.083
your competition was,
and they were going
to kill you.

13:04.250 --> 13:05.959
Man:
<i> I've been pushing them</i>
<i> very hard.</i>

13:05.959 --> 13:07.500
If you want me to start
working them 12 hours a day,

13:07.500 --> 13:09.125
I can do that.

13:09.166 --> 13:10.792
I think that would probably
help us catch up.

13:10.792 --> 13:12.333
We are over budget
and we're out of time.

13:12.333 --> 13:14.000
Get to work.

13:15.208 --> 13:17.001
Narrator:
<i> Durant has been racing</i>

13:17.001 --> 13:19.917
<i> to complete his most ambitious</i>
<i> project to date...</i>

13:24.792 --> 13:28.542
<i> a rail line connecting</i>
<i> the country from east to west.</i>

13:31.417 --> 13:33.333
Brands:
<i> The Transcontinental Railroad</i>

13:33.333 --> 13:36.375
<i> was the biggest</i>
<i> public works project</i>
<i> of its time.</i>

13:36.375 --> 13:38.083
Probably the biggest
public works project

13:38.083 --> 13:40.041
of the 19th century.

13:42.208 --> 13:44.333
Narrator:
<i> Nearly 2,000 miles of track</i>

13:44.333 --> 13:46.417
<i> are laid out</i>
<i> across the country,</i>

13:46.417 --> 13:49.875
<i> cutting through ravines,</i>
<i> solid granite mountain ranges,</i>

13:49.875 --> 13:52.458
<i> and unmapped</i>
<i> Indian territory.</i>

13:52.458 --> 13:56.125
<i> It's one of the most ambitious</i>
<i> engineering projects</i>

13:56.125 --> 13:58.458
<i> the world has ever seen.</i>

14:02.917 --> 14:05.291
<i> Now with the railroad</i>
<i> nearly done,</i>

14:05.291 --> 14:07.041
<i> Durant is ready to unveil</i>

14:07.041 --> 14:10.041
<i> his crowning achievement</i>
<i> to the world.</i>

14:19.917 --> 14:21.917
Durant:
There are plenty
of festivities planned

14:21.917 --> 14:25.333
to help celebrate
this grand joining
of east and west,

14:25.333 --> 14:29.417
the first
transcontinental railroad
in the entire world.

14:32.250 --> 14:34.834
How much
is the golden spike worth?

14:34.834 --> 14:37.250
( laughs )
Next thing I know,

14:37.250 --> 14:39.333
you'll be wanting to pry it
right out of the tracks, right?

14:39.375 --> 14:41.166
<i> ( laughter )</i>

14:45.542 --> 14:47.959
- Mr. Durant.
- Ahem.

14:51.625 --> 14:55.583
Henceforth,
there shall be but one

14:55.583 --> 14:58.333
Pacific Railroad.

15:00.959 --> 15:03.125
( applause )

15:03.125 --> 15:06.083
Walter Borneman:
<i> This joining of the rails</i>
<i> at Promontory Summit</i>

15:06.083 --> 15:09.875
<i> in terms</i>
<i> of the American psyche</i>
<i> really can't be overstated.</i>

15:09.875 --> 15:14.083
It's not unlike men
walking on the moon
a century later.

15:14.083 --> 15:17.458
Narrator:
<i> The golden spike is connected</i>
<i> to a telegraph wire,</i>

15:17.458 --> 15:20.542
<i> and when it's struck,</i>
<i> it's instantly telegraphed</i>

15:20.542 --> 15:22.375
<i> to stations</i>
<i> across the country,</i>

15:22.375 --> 15:27.041
<i> all the way from Utah</i>
<i> to Washington, DC.</i>

15:29.291 --> 15:31.250

15:36.917 --> 15:39.083
the last spike is driven,

15:39.125 --> 15:40.583
the Pacific Railroad
is finished."

15:40.583 --> 15:44.291
- Congratulations!
- ( laughter )

15:45.291 --> 15:46.959
Man #2:
<i> Hear, hear.</i>

15:46.959 --> 15:48.917
The Union Pacific,
gentlemen!

15:52.250 --> 15:54.083
( chatter )

15:54.083 --> 15:56.959
Narrator:
<i> After years of turmoil</i>
<i> out west,</i>

15:56.959 --> 15:59.542
<i> President Grant knows</i>
<i> this puts America</i>

15:59.542 --> 16:02.333
<i> on the cusp of a new era.</i>

16:06.333 --> 16:09.417
Borneman:
<i> For many years, the concept</i>
<i> of frontier in America</i>

16:09.417 --> 16:13.166
<i> has really been that</i>
<i> of a line moving westward.</i>

16:13.166 --> 16:18.000
But what the railroads did
is they obliterated that line.

16:18.000 --> 16:21.959
<i> Suddenly the frontier</i>
<i> was all over the place,</i>

16:21.959 --> 16:25.291
and civilization was filling in
the blank spots on the map

16:25.291 --> 16:26.959
<i> in a very speedy fashion.</i>

16:31.500 --> 16:34.417
Narrator:
<i> As settlers flock west,</i>

16:34.417 --> 16:37.333
<i> an economic boom follows.</i>

16:38.583 --> 16:41.250
<i> And big business</i>
<i> in the East</i>

16:41.250 --> 16:44.583
<i> begins investing</i>
<i> in the West.</i>

16:44.583 --> 16:47.500
Brands:
<i> This was the way</i>
<i> you built an economy.</i>

16:47.500 --> 16:50.542
It meant that there were
new outlets for investment.

16:50.583 --> 16:53.542
There were new outlets
for speculation.

16:53.542 --> 16:56.458
<i> There were lots</i>
<i> of people who made money from</i>
<i> the Transcontinental Railroad.</i>

16:56.458 --> 16:59.250
There were more people
that were going to make money
from more railroads

16:59.291 --> 17:01.583
and from the economic
spin-offs of railroads.

17:11.125 --> 17:14.166
Narrator:
<i> But where most of the country</i>
<i> sees progress,</i>

17:14.166 --> 17:16.375
<i> some see a target.</i>

17:19.291 --> 17:21.583
<i> Like outlaw Jesse James.</i>

17:21.583 --> 17:24.041
<i> ( train whistle blows )</i>

17:35.458 --> 17:37.542
( chatter )

17:40.208 --> 17:42.625
I'm going to be here.
Train's going to slow down.

17:42.625 --> 17:45.458
That's going to give us
plenty of time.

17:45.458 --> 17:47.709
See how it comes around
this bend here?

17:47.709 --> 17:49.625
That's where we're going
to hit it, okay?

17:51.667 --> 17:53.750
Narrator:
<i> In the years following</i>
<i> the Civil War,</i>

17:53.750 --> 17:56.166
<i> Jesse James</i>
<i> and his brother Frank</i>

17:56.166 --> 17:59.250
<i> have been on a crusade</i>
<i> against the Union,</i>

17:59.250 --> 18:02.291
<i> and the young outlaw</i>
<i>has quickly established himself</i>

18:02.291 --> 18:05.542
<i> as one of the most feared</i>
<i> bank robbers in the country.</i>

18:05.542 --> 18:07.333
Burt Reynolds:
<i> I think he was just angry</i>

18:07.333 --> 18:10.417
<i> about the way the country</i>
<i> was coming together.</i>

18:10.417 --> 18:11.750
So he said,
"To hell with it.

18:11.750 --> 18:14.417
I'll just weaken you
at the knees."

18:17.083 --> 18:20.166
Narrator:
<i> Now with railroads expanding</i>
<i> across the country,</i>

18:20.166 --> 18:21.709
<i> Jesse sees another symbol</i>

18:21.709 --> 18:24.125
<i> of the North's oppression</i>
<i> of the South.</i>

18:24.125 --> 18:27.041
( whistle blows )

18:29.709 --> 18:33.083
Redford:
<i> Railroad was on one track,</i>
<i> and it was kind of stuck.</i>

18:33.083 --> 18:34.625
And they had horses.

18:34.625 --> 18:37.750
So they could rob a train,
then ride away.

18:37.750 --> 18:40.417
( whistle blows )

18:45.208 --> 18:48.458
- ( men chattering )
- Come on, boys, now.
Put your back into it.

18:48.458 --> 18:50.125
We got a schedule.

18:50.125 --> 18:52.125
Watch your toes on that.

18:52.125 --> 18:54.792
Now get those up
in a nice big X up here.

18:59.750 --> 19:02.667
( whistle blows )

19:07.417 --> 19:09.834
( screeching )

19:21.375 --> 19:24.125
We'll get this thing going
as soon as we can.

19:30.250 --> 19:32.417
- ( gunshot )
-<i> ( women scream )</i>

19:32.417 --> 19:34.583
Ladies and gentlemen,

19:34.583 --> 19:37.834
I apologize
for the inconvenience.

19:37.834 --> 19:39.834
If you will kindly present
your valuables,

19:39.834 --> 19:42.417
we'll have you on your way
in no time.

19:52.333 --> 19:54.458
That's a nice watch.

19:54.458 --> 19:58.333
Yes, it is.
My daddy gave it to me.

19:58.333 --> 20:00.542
Where you from?

20:00.542 --> 20:03.125
Kentucky.

20:03.125 --> 20:05.792
My daddy
was from Kentucky.

20:05.792 --> 20:07.667
He was a preacher.

20:12.917 --> 20:14.583
Take care of that.

20:14.583 --> 20:16.792
Thank you, sir.

20:16.792 --> 20:18.709
Smile, girls.

20:18.709 --> 20:21.208
<i> Gonna have a nice story</i>
<i> to tell your friends later.</i>

20:26.458 --> 20:28.458
That's a nice suit.

20:28.458 --> 20:32.250
Hey, Frank,
what do you think
about this suit?

20:32.250 --> 20:34.500
Boy don't look like
he's from around here.

20:34.500 --> 20:36.667
Jesse:
<i> No, he doesn't.</i>

20:36.667 --> 20:38.625
Where you from?

20:38.625 --> 20:40.500
<i> New York City.</i>

20:40.500 --> 20:42.333
New York City?

20:45.208 --> 20:46.834
What's that?

20:49.208 --> 20:51.208
G-A-R.

20:54.667 --> 20:56.875
That's the Grand Army
of the Republic.

21:00.250 --> 21:03.375
You know, I have
a Union bullet
in my lung.

21:09.291 --> 21:12.291
Jesse, we got what we need.
Let's be on our way now.

21:16.542 --> 21:18.458
The war is over.

21:19.834 --> 21:22.333
Jesse.

21:22.333 --> 21:23.834
No, it's not.

21:48.667 --> 21:50.792
Narrator:
<i> In his first train robbery,</i>

21:50.792 --> 21:52.875
<i> Jesse James steals</i>
<i> the modern-day equivalent</i>

21:52.875 --> 21:56.625
<i> of $50,000,</i>

21:56.625 --> 22:01.667
<i> solidifying his reputation</i>
<i> as a notorious outlaw.</i>

22:03.375 --> 22:05.792
<i> ( horse whinnies )</i>

22:08.333 --> 22:10.875
<i> But while many</i>
<i> fear Jesse James...</i>

22:12.875 --> 22:16.583
<i> one man sees his crime spree</i>
<i> as an opportunity--</i>

22:16.583 --> 22:20.667
<i> Missouri newspaper editor</i>
<i> John Newman Edwards.</i>

22:20.667 --> 22:22.834
Gardner:
<i> John Newman Edwards</i>

22:22.834 --> 22:27.083
was probably the most hardcore
of Confederates,

22:27.083 --> 22:31.041
<i> and in his opinion,</i>
<i> southerners had been outlawed,</i>

22:31.041 --> 22:33.417
disenfranchised
by the North.

22:33.417 --> 22:35.875
Narrator:
<i> Edwards has been</i>
<i> looking for a new way</i>

22:35.875 --> 22:38.667
<i> to push</i>
<i> his Confederate agenda,</i>

22:38.667 --> 22:42.125
<i> and Jesse James</i>
<i> might be the answer.</i>

22:42.125 --> 22:45.375
<i> ( horse whinnies )</i>

23:03.041 --> 23:04.709
Drink?

23:18.125 --> 23:20.041
To the Confederacy.

23:26.542 --> 23:29.125
- I was a soldier,
too, you know--
- What is it you want?

23:31.750 --> 23:33.959
I wanna know why
you robbed that train.

23:39.959 --> 23:43.792
<i>There aren't a lot</i>
<i>of other ways to survive.</i>

23:45.792 --> 23:49.500
Not for a soldier
who wore gray.

23:49.500 --> 23:53.834
Jesse, you don't have
to be a common criminal

23:53.834 --> 23:55.834
running from the law.

23:55.834 --> 23:59.000
I can make you a hero.

23:59.041 --> 24:02.542
I don't need you
to make me anything.

24:03.917 --> 24:06.834
It's about more
than just you, Jesse.

24:09.625 --> 24:14.166
The Southern spirit,
it still lives.

24:14.166 --> 24:19.458
The people
who read my paper,
they believe.

24:19.458 --> 24:23.041
But they want someone
to believe in.

24:23.041 --> 24:25.083
Someone like you.

24:28.083 --> 24:30.625
The South needs you.

24:37.709 --> 24:39.959
Now that you
put it that way...

24:49.542 --> 24:51.834
( whistle blows )

24:53.750 --> 24:56.041
Narrator:
<i> Jesse partners with Edwards</i>

24:56.041 --> 24:58.583
<i> and launches</i>
<i> another robbing spree</i>

24:58.583 --> 25:01.500
<i> targeting northern wealth.</i>

25:01.500 --> 25:05.041
<i> But now he has the power</i>
<i> of the press behind him.</i>

25:08.041 --> 25:10.208
Eisenbach:
<i> It's impossible to talk</i>
<i> about Jesse James</i>

25:10.208 --> 25:12.834
<i> without talking about</i>
<i> John Newman Edwards,</i>

25:12.834 --> 25:15.542
who really just becomes
Jesse James' publicist

25:15.542 --> 25:18.667
and is the one
who manufactures the myth

25:18.667 --> 25:20.834
<i> of Jesse James the rebel</i>

25:20.834 --> 25:23.542
<i> who's on this</i>
<i> mission to stick it</i>
<i> to the establishment,</i>

25:23.542 --> 25:26.750
justifying
these criminal acts.

25:28.542 --> 25:31.001
( gunfire )

25:32.500 --> 25:34.208
Narrator:
<i> Across the South,</i>

25:34.250 --> 25:37.500
<i> Jesse James is no longer</i>
<i> seen as a criminal,</i>

25:37.500 --> 25:40.625
<i> but as a hero</i>
<i> for the Confederacy.</i>

25:40.625 --> 25:41.959
There was a love affair

25:41.959 --> 25:43.875
with people that stood up
for themselves

25:43.875 --> 25:47.583
<i> and great stories</i>
<i> of people like Jesse James.</i>

25:47.583 --> 25:48.959
<i> They were outlaws.</i>

25:48.959 --> 25:51.083
<i> They were wanted</i>
<i> by the government,</i>

25:51.083 --> 25:53.291
<i> but they were standing up</i>
<i> for themselves.</i>

25:55.667 --> 25:58.125
Narrator:
<i> With Jesse James</i>
<i> and other outlaws like him</i>

25:58.125 --> 25:59.583
<i> terrorizing</i>
<i> the railroads...</i>

25:59.583 --> 26:01.250
Come on, let's go.
Let's go.

26:01.250 --> 26:04.875
<i> ...the push to settle the West</i>
<i> is once again at risk.</i>

26:08.959 --> 26:13.083
Narrator:
<i> President Grant is dealing</i>
<i> with a growing outlaw problem</i>

26:13.083 --> 26:16.959
<i> that interferes</i>
<i> with western expansion.</i>

26:16.959 --> 26:21.166
<i> But now he's about to face</i>
<i> an even greater threat.</i>

26:22.291 --> 26:24.583
( bell ringing )

26:30.291 --> 26:31.875
Durant:
"Julesburg cut denied.

26:31.875 --> 26:34.667
Propose reinforcement
of existing structure.

26:34.667 --> 26:38.542
Authorize expenditure
of no more than $7,500."

26:38.542 --> 26:40.291
Did you see this?

26:40.291 --> 26:43.001
This morning's
"New York Sun."

26:57.166 --> 26:59.166
How much do they know?

26:59.166 --> 27:01.083
<i>Everything.</i>

27:03.208 --> 27:06.250
Narrator:
<i> An investigation finds</i>
<i> that Thomas Durant,</i>

27:06.291 --> 27:08.125
<i> the head</i>
<i> of the Union Pacific</i>

27:08.125 --> 27:11.125
<i> and the hero of</i>
<i> the Transcontinental Railroad,</i>

27:11.125 --> 27:13.667
<i> has been stealing</i>
<i> millions of dollars</i>

27:13.667 --> 27:15.792
<i> from the US government.</i>

27:15.792 --> 27:17.834
<i> Durant has been</i>
<i> taking advantage</i>

27:17.834 --> 27:21.166
<i> of the government's offer</i>
<i> to fund railroad construction</i>

27:21.166 --> 27:25.959
<i> by drastically overcharging</i>
<i> for supplies and labor.</i>

27:25.959 --> 27:30.750
<i> He's pocketed $16.5 million</i>
<i> of taxpayer money,</i>

27:30.750 --> 27:33.291
<i> all the while</i>
<i> paying off politicians</i>

27:33.291 --> 27:35.208
<i> to look the other way.</i>

27:35.250 --> 27:37.583
Eisenbach:
<i> The railroads</i>
<i> were being funded</i>

27:37.583 --> 27:41.041
through these financial schemes
that were made possible

27:41.041 --> 27:46.000
by not only no regulations,
but members of Congress

27:46.000 --> 27:48.709
who were actually
in on the schemes,

27:48.709 --> 27:50.792
<i> being paid off</i>
<i> by the corporations</i>

27:50.792 --> 27:54.125
<i> and given stocks</i>
<i> at discounted rates.</i>

27:54.125 --> 27:56.917
The American public
is furious.

28:00.834 --> 28:05.166
Your Honor,
I have here receipts

28:05.208 --> 28:07.333
showing that the cost
of construction

28:07.333 --> 28:11.125
<i> was less than half</i>
<i> of what Mr. Durant estimated.</i>

28:11.125 --> 28:14.875
Mr. Durant,
I ask you,

28:14.875 --> 28:16.625
what happened
to the rest of the money?

28:16.625 --> 28:19.083
We have a right to make
a reasonable profit.

28:19.083 --> 28:22.000
A reasonable amount?
100% is a reasonable amount?

28:22.000 --> 28:24.166
Well, who is to define
what is reasonable

28:24.166 --> 28:26.917
and what
is not reasonable?

28:26.959 --> 28:30.667
<i>Mr. Durant, our records</i>
<i>clearly indicate</i>

28:30.667 --> 28:33.667
that you've made
a profit of over 100%,

28:33.667 --> 28:35.750
with no records
of where that money is.

28:35.750 --> 28:38.750
So I ask you again,
where is the money,
Mr. Durant?

28:44.917 --> 28:49.001
Narrator:
<i> Once the scheme is exposed,</i>
<i> investors run scared</i>

28:49.001 --> 28:51.250
<i> and railroad stocks</i>
<i> plummet,</i>

28:51.250 --> 28:54.709
<i> leaving the nation's economy</i>
<i> in jeopardy.</i>

28:54.709 --> 28:56.041
Borneman:
<i> Everyone is so excited</i>

28:56.083 --> 28:59.417
<i> about pouring money</i>
<i> into railroads,</i>

28:59.417 --> 29:02.083
<i> but when the scandal breaks</i>
<i> on the scene,</i>

29:02.083 --> 29:05.083
<i> suddenly railroads</i>
<i> don't look too good.</i>

29:05.125 --> 29:07.417
It's really not unlike
the dot-com bubble

29:07.417 --> 29:09.291
of the late 1990s.

29:09.291 --> 29:11.959
<i> Everyone</i>
<i> gets overextended.</i>

29:11.959 --> 29:15.917
<i> And at some point,</i>
<i> all bubbles burst.</i>

29:15.917 --> 29:19.834
Narrator:
<i> One-third of the country's</i>
<i> 360 railroad companies</i>

29:19.834 --> 29:21.333
<i> go bankrupt,</i>

29:21.333 --> 29:25.001
<i> sending the economy</i>
<i> into a tailspin.</i>

29:25.001 --> 29:27.458
<i> It's the crisis</i>
<i> that comes to be known</i>

29:27.458 --> 29:30.834
<i> as the Panic of 1873.</i>

29:30.834 --> 29:32.375
The Panic of 1873

29:32.375 --> 29:35.709
resulted from overexpansion
in railroads,

29:35.709 --> 29:37.917
<i> speculation in railroads,</i>

29:37.917 --> 29:41.917
<i> and it brought down</i>
<i> much of the American</i>
<i> financial industry.</i>

29:41.917 --> 29:45.083
The financial panic spread
to the broader economy.

29:47.792 --> 29:50.375
Narrator:
<i> The panic causes</i>
<i> the New York Stock Exchange</i>

29:50.375 --> 29:53.917
<i> to close for 10 days.</i>

29:53.917 --> 29:58.166
<i> And America descends into</i>
<i> its first great depression.</i>

30:07.917 --> 30:13.166
<i> The nation plummets</i>
<i> nearly $2 billion into debt,</i>

30:13.166 --> 30:16.083
<i> 20,000 businesses close,</i>

30:16.083 --> 30:19.375
<i> and one in eight Americans</i>
<i> are left unemployed.</i>

30:22.208 --> 30:26.792
Hutton:
<i> I think there was</i>
<i> a sense of desperation.</i>

30:26.792 --> 30:28.792
<i> Conditions were very harsh,</i>

30:28.792 --> 30:31.208
and the promises made
by the railroad companies

30:31.208 --> 30:33.792
<i> didn't pan out.</i>

30:42.542 --> 30:45.166
Narrator:
<i> As his first term</i>
<i> nears its end,</i>

30:45.166 --> 30:47.083
<i> President Grant</i>
<i> is desperate</i>

Man:
<i> The Treasury has given</i>
<i> and given and given, right?</i>

31:05.959 --> 31:07.792
What is it?

31:11.291 --> 31:13.125
Gold.

31:24.166 --> 31:27.083
Narrator:
<i> Nearly 1,600 miles</i>
<i> from Washington,</i>

31:27.083 --> 31:30.375
<i> rumor of gold deep</i>
<i> in the Black Hills</i>
<i> of the Dakotas</i>

31:30.375 --> 31:32.125
<i> is beginning to spread.</i>

31:35.375 --> 31:37.959
<i> The only problem--</i>
<i> the Black Hills</i>

31:37.959 --> 31:40.917
<i> are located</i>
<i> on Indian territory...</i>

31:43.458 --> 31:46.291
<i> the same land</i>
<i> Grant promised the Lakota</i>

31:46.291 --> 31:48.333
<i> he would never touch.</i>

31:53.166 --> 31:56.542
<i> During the worst depression</i>
<i> in US history,</i>

31:56.542 --> 31:58.917
<i> President Grant</i>
<i> hears rumors of gold</i>

31:58.917 --> 32:01.291
<i> on the Lakota Sioux</i>
<i> reservation...</i>

32:03.417 --> 32:05.542
<i> land that he promised</i>
<i> the Indians</i>

32:05.542 --> 32:08.041
<i> would remain untouched.</i>

32:13.250 --> 32:16.417
<i> Hoping to avoid a new conflict</i>
<i> with the Indians,</i>

32:16.417 --> 32:19.625
<i> Grant and General Sherman</i>
<i> plan a secret expedition</i>

32:19.625 --> 32:22.083
<i> to verify the find,</i>

32:22.083 --> 32:24.667
<i> and they call on</i>
<i> their top commander</i>
<i> in the West.</i>

32:31.125 --> 32:32.500
Mr. President.

32:36.959 --> 32:38.125
Have a seat.

32:41.125 --> 32:44.125
There are rumors of gold
in the Black Hills.

32:45.500 --> 32:49.709
We need you to take
a small team of miners...

32:49.709 --> 32:51.458
and find out
if these rumors
are true.

32:51.458 --> 32:54.250
<i> I need you to evaluate</i>
<i> how much gold there is,</i>

32:54.250 --> 32:56.125
where it's located,

32:56.125 --> 32:58.125
and then directly
report back to us.

32:58.125 --> 33:00.959
Report to us
and only us.

33:04.709 --> 33:07.625
Is that clear?

33:09.166 --> 33:11.458
Yes, Mr. President.

33:15.709 --> 33:18.000
Narrator:
<i> For George Armstrong Custer,</i>

33:18.000 --> 33:21.625
<i> the mission is about</i>
<i> more than just finding gold.</i>

33:24.291 --> 33:27.208
Eisenbach:
<i> Custer is seeing himself</i>

33:27.208 --> 33:30.709
as a man who's got
this opportunity.

33:32.417 --> 33:36.083
<i> The opportunity to become</i>
<i> this national hero</i>

33:36.083 --> 33:39.208
<i> by leading this expedition</i>
<i> that is going to solve</i>

33:39.208 --> 33:40.750
<i> all of Americans'</i>
<i> financial problems</i>

33:40.750 --> 33:43.125
by getting
this mother lode of gold

33:43.125 --> 33:45.458
that could be bigger
than the California Gold Rush.

33:45.458 --> 33:48.583
<i> He's got to come up</i>
<i> with a big victory here.</i>

34:38.709 --> 34:40.625
Custer:
<i> "Our initial survey suggests</i>

34:40.625 --> 34:44.583
<i> significant deposits</i>
<i> in the eastern Black Hills,</i>

34:44.583 --> 34:47.375
and I expect
in the next several days

34:47.375 --> 34:50.750
we will find more gold
than this country
has ever seen.

34:53.458 --> 34:55.500
Triumphantly Yours,

34:55.500 --> 34:58.291
Lieutenant Colonel
George Armstrong Custer."

34:59.458 --> 35:01.083
<i> Send a copy of that</i>
<i> to Washington</i>

35:01.083 --> 35:02.792
<i> as soon as you get</i>
<i> to Fort Laramie.</i>

35:02.792 --> 35:04.625
Yes, sir.

35:04.667 --> 35:07.250
And send a copy of it
to James Gordon Bennett

35:07.250 --> 35:09.166
at the "New York Herald."

35:09.166 --> 35:10.667
Sir?

35:10.667 --> 35:12.667
You have your orders.

35:12.667 --> 35:14.542
Yes, sir.

35:22.583 --> 35:25.083
Narrator:
<i> Looking to advance</i>
<i> his own fame,</i>

35:25.083 --> 35:29.250
<i> Custer announces his discovery</i>
<i> to the national press.</i>

35:34.625 --> 35:38.458
The country was in the midst
of a very, very deep depression,

35:38.458 --> 35:41.583
<i> so gold in the Black Hills</i>
<i> had everyone excited.</i>

35:44.333 --> 35:47.875
<i> Custer started this stampede</i>
<i> into the most sacred</i>
<i> Indian land.</i>

35:50.709 --> 35:53.500
Narrator:
<i> When news of</i>
<i> the discovery spreads,</i>

35:53.500 --> 35:56.333
<i> thousands of miners flood</i>
<i> the Black Hills,</i>

35:56.333 --> 35:59.750
<i>a direct violation of the terms</i>
<i> of the peace treaty.</i>

36:03.250 --> 36:05.166
Grant:
<i> Damn Custer.</i>

36:06.333 --> 36:08.750
He has got us
in a hell of a spot.

36:12.208 --> 36:15.166
<i>We've had five years</i>
<i>of peace with the Indians.</i>

36:16.625 --> 36:18.625
Now I'm supposed
to throw it all away

36:18.625 --> 36:20.917
over gold.

36:24.291 --> 36:30.291
Perhaps, sir,
it's not Custer that's
truly the issue here.

36:30.291 --> 36:32.667
<i> What you've done with</i>
<i> the Indians is admirable.</i>

36:32.667 --> 36:34.667
It really is.

36:34.667 --> 36:38.291
But right now
our own people
are starving.

36:38.291 --> 36:40.625
<i> What are those people</i>
<i> going to say</i>

36:40.625 --> 36:43.625
<i> when they find out</i>
<i> that their president</i>

36:43.625 --> 36:47.834
<i> had a chance to end</i>
<i> the worst suffering</i>
<i> they've ever known,</i>

36:47.834 --> 36:50.250
but chose not to?

36:52.250 --> 36:56.291
Brands:
<i> There was strong sentiment</i>
<i> in Congress in favor of</i>

36:56.291 --> 36:58.291
<i> "Open this territory</i>
<i> to the settlers.</i>

36:58.291 --> 37:00.834
Let's take advantage
of these gifts

37:00.834 --> 37:04.500
that God has placed there,
hidden them from the Indians."

37:04.500 --> 37:06.834
<i> Once the news of gold</i>
<i> in the Black Hills got out,</i>

37:06.834 --> 37:09.667
<i> then Grant's peace policy</i>
<i> was in tatters.</i>

37:11.959 --> 37:16.500
Narrator:
<i> Grant has to decide</i>
<i> how far he's willing to go</i>

37:16.500 --> 37:19.333
<i> to keep peace</i>
<i> with the Indians.</i>

37:23.750 --> 37:27.667
Narrator:<i> As President Grant</i>
<i> deals with a crippling</i>
<i> economic depression</i>

37:27.667 --> 37:30.792
<i> and a brewing conflict</i>
<i> with the Indians...</i>

37:32.917 --> 37:35.792
<i> 900 miles away</i>
<i> in Missouri,</i>

37:35.792 --> 37:37.709
<i> one man</i>
<i> has found his own way</i>

37:37.709 --> 37:40.542
<i> of disrupting</i>
<i> westward expansion.</i>

37:52.333 --> 37:53.792
How you feeling?

37:55.667 --> 37:58.500
Hey,
I ever tell you that joke
about the pig and the cow?

37:58.500 --> 37:59.834
Why don't you
tell me that joke?

37:59.834 --> 38:02.250
All right, then.

38:02.250 --> 38:04.917
Cow came up to a pig
on the train tracks,

38:04.917 --> 38:08.250
said, "Moo-ve over,
you're hogging up
the road."

38:08.250 --> 38:11.291
( both laugh )

38:12.250 --> 38:14.500
That is not a funny joke.

38:17.458 --> 38:20.458
<i>Well, humor's never been</i>
<i>my strong suit.</i>

38:21.709 --> 38:25.750
<i> ( distant train whistle</i>
<i> blowing )</i>

38:28.333 --> 38:31.500
Ask me, this is
my favorite part
right here.

38:31.500 --> 38:34.417
( whistle blowing )

38:34.417 --> 38:36.000
We're about to make
some money today, boy.

38:36.000 --> 38:37.750
That's right.

38:43.709 --> 38:46.041
( gunshot )

38:46.041 --> 38:49.792
Narrator:
<i> Train robberies by Jesse James</i>
<i> and his brother Frank</i>

38:49.792 --> 38:53.667
<i> are wreaking havoc</i>
<i> on the country's railroad</i>
<i> industry.</i>

38:54.750 --> 38:57.291
<i> Over a six-month period,</i>

38:57.291 --> 38:59.875
<i> Jesse and his gang</i>
<i> commit a string of robberies,</i>

38:59.875 --> 39:02.000
<i> making off with</i>
<i> the modern-day equivalent</i>

39:02.000 --> 39:06.750
<i> of over $300,000.</i>

39:06.750 --> 39:09.792
Gardner:
<i> The railroads do not want</i>
<i> robbers stopping their train.</i>

39:09.792 --> 39:12.667
They don't want robbers
terrifying their passengers.

39:12.667 --> 39:14.291
<i> It's bad for business.</i>

39:14.291 --> 39:15.834
<i> In fact, there was</i>
<i> one railroad passenger</i>

39:15.834 --> 39:17.917
who said, "I don't care
if it costs me $500.

39:17.917 --> 39:20.291
I'm not riding a train
through Missouri.

39:20.291 --> 39:22.959
I'll go around through Iowa
or Minnesota or whatever,

39:22.959 --> 39:26.667
but I'm not
going to take a train
through the state of Missouri."

39:26.667 --> 39:29.291
Narrator:
<i> As their losses</i>
<i> from robberies mount,</i>

39:29.291 --> 39:31.875
<i> railroad companies</i>
<i> are desperate to put a stop</i>

39:31.917 --> 39:34.583
<i> to outlaws</i>
<i> like Jesse James.</i>

39:34.583 --> 39:37.792
It's going to require
a massive commitment

39:37.792 --> 39:40.375
of personnel
and resources

39:40.375 --> 39:43.083
<i> to clamping down</i>
<i> on the likes of Jesse James.</i>

39:43.083 --> 39:45.375
<i> But you don't have</i>
<i> an FBI.</i>

39:45.375 --> 39:47.875
You don't have
a federal bureaucracy

39:47.875 --> 39:52.500
and law enforcement armed
to protect business interests
across state lines,

39:52.500 --> 39:54.625
and that is where
private business comes in.

40:03.500 --> 40:05.041
Narrator:
<i> The railroad companies turn</i>

40:05.041 --> 40:07.041

<i> in the country for help.</i>

40:09.667 --> 40:12.542
<i> His name</i>
<i> is Allan Pinkerton.</i>

40:15.417 --> 40:18.375
Gardner:
<i> Allan Pinkerton was part of</i>
<i> the Union Intelligence Service</i>

40:18.375 --> 40:19.959
<i> during the Civil War.</i>

40:19.959 --> 40:22.375
He gained fame
by preventing

40:22.375 --> 40:24.458
a supposed
assassination plot

40:24.458 --> 40:26.500
<i> against</i>
<i> President Abraham Lincoln.</i>

40:28.583 --> 40:31.542
Narrator:
<i> Following the war,</i>
<i> Pinkerton moved to Chicago</i>

40:31.542 --> 40:34.083
<i> and opened the Pinkerton</i>
<i> Detective Agency...</i>

40:39.125 --> 40:42.834
<i> and building massive dossiers</i>

<i> With over 30,000 agents</i>

40:51.041 --> 40:53.458
<i> Pinkerton commands a force</i>

40:58.625 --> 41:02.417
<i> Now he has the biggest case</i>
<i> in his company's history.</i>

41:16.875 --> 41:21.083
He's smart,
ruthlessly violent,
and good with a gun.

41:23.041 --> 41:27.083
The bastard was
a Confederate guerilla
during the war.

41:27.083 --> 41:30.917
Lord knows how many
Union soldiers he killed.

41:30.917 --> 41:36.083
<i>The Adams Express Company</i>
<i>is calling us in.</i>

41:36.083 --> 41:39.583
They need this man

41:42.041 --> 41:44.125
<i>You can say no,</i>
<i>of course.</i>

41:45.625 --> 41:48.875
If you have any

41:51.458 --> 41:53.000
you should.
