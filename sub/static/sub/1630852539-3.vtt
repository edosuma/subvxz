(blows bubbles,

16:31.699 --> 16:32.825
Rue?

16:34.034 --> 16:35.703
Are you high?

16:35.786 --> 16:37.246
Rue:
Oh, fuck me.

16:37.329 --> 16:40.332
Was she there the whole time,
or did she just walk in?

16:43.794 --> 16:45.212
I mean...

16:45.295 --> 16:46.880
(ding)

16:46.964 --> 16:48.298
Now, as a beloved character

16:48.382 --> 16:49.633
that a lot of people
are rooting for,

16:49.717 --> 16:53.512
I feel a certain responsibility
to make good decisions.

16:54.513 --> 16:55.723
But I relapsed.

16:57.266 --> 16:59.393
(chaotic music playing)

17:03.605 --> 17:05.232
In all fairness,
I did say in the beginning

17:05.315 --> 17:07.735
I had no intentions
of staying clean,

17:07.818 --> 17:08.986
but I get it.

17:09.069 --> 17:10.195
Our country's dark...

17:12.489 --> 17:14.324
and fucked up.

17:14.408 --> 17:17.578
And people,
they just wanna find hope...

17:18.454 --> 17:21.165
(angelic vocalizing)

17:21.248 --> 17:23.333
-Somewhere.
-Anywhere.

17:26.253 --> 17:28.297
And if not in reality...

17:28.380 --> 17:30.299
(through TV):
then in television.

17:30.382 --> 17:33.385
Unfortunately... I'm not it.

17:36.180 --> 17:37.765
Ugh. Elly?

17:41.268 --> 17:43.729
Oh, shit.
Sorry, that was
from last year.

17:43.812 --> 17:44.730
Sorry.

17:46.315 --> 17:49.735
"How to Get Away
With Being a Drug Addict."

17:49.818 --> 17:53.322
Step one: Find a cover drug.

17:53.405 --> 17:55.032
'Cause no matter how
hard you try to hide it,

17:55.115 --> 17:56.658
if you're doing drugs,
you're gonna get caught.

17:56.742 --> 17:58.994
It's inevitable,
and when that does happen,

17:59.077 --> 18:01.455
you don't wanna be
on the defensive.

18:01.538 --> 18:05.334
Trust me, no one believes
an addict when they're caught.

18:07.920 --> 18:12.341
So, first things first,
you want to lay the groundwork.

18:12.424 --> 18:14.885
-Heyo.
-Gia: This movie's nuts.

18:14.968 --> 18:16.178
Which one is this?

18:16.261 --> 18:18.555
-"Killer Baby"?
I don't even know.
-Ohh!

18:18.639 --> 18:20.390
Rue: "Killer Mutant Baby."

18:22.434 --> 18:23.685
Oh shit.

18:25.938 --> 18:27.815
I think I'm gonna
start smoking weed.

18:33.153 --> 18:36.323
Why would you
start smoking weed?

18:36.406 --> 18:38.575
'Cause I have panic attacks
every fucking day.

18:42.246 --> 18:44.331
You are so
fucking selfish.

18:48.794 --> 18:50.045
Gia.

18:51.129 --> 18:52.047
Gia!

18:53.465 --> 18:55.759
Gia, it fuckin' helps with my...

18:55.843 --> 18:57.386
fuckin' anxiety,
and my panic attacks,

18:57.469 --> 19:00.597
-and shit, Gia.
-Gia: I don't wanna
talk to you, Rue.

19:00.681 --> 19:03.392
-Can you just fuckin'
listen for a second?
-Gia: I don't wanna talk to you!

19:03.475 --> 19:06.478
-Gia! Gia, what the fuck?!
-Gia (screams): Stop!

19:06.562 --> 19:08.021
The fuck is wrong--
What the--

19:08.105 --> 19:09.815
-Rue: Are you fucking crazy?!
-Gia: Don't push me!

19:09.898 --> 19:12.234
-What the fuck
is wrong with you?
-Get your hands off of me!

19:12.317 --> 19:14.653
It's a fucking idea!
I wasn't gonna
fucking do it!

19:14.736 --> 19:16.363
-You're a liar!
-I'm a fuckin' liar?!

19:16.446 --> 19:18.073
-I'm tryin' to fuckin'
tell you something!
-Yes, and you don't give a shit

19:18.156 --> 19:20.200
about you, you don't
give a shit about me.

19:20.284 --> 19:22.536
-You don't give a shit
about your mama.
-It's a fucking idea!

19:22.619 --> 19:24.371
(screams):
I'm not actually
doin' fuckin' weed!

19:24.454 --> 19:25.414
It was an idea, okay?!

19:25.497 --> 19:26.790
And I should've
never fuckin' told you

19:26.874 --> 19:27.833
'cause you're just
like fucking Mom.

19:27.916 --> 19:29.001
-Don't put--
-Both of you are

19:29.084 --> 19:30.377
fucking crazy!

19:32.379 --> 19:34.006
Rue:
Now, what you wanna do is

19:34.089 --> 19:36.133
make them second guess
their intuition,

19:36.216 --> 19:38.594
make them feel like
any valid concern

19:38.677 --> 19:41.555
is just their anxiety
getting the best of them.

19:42.639 --> 19:45.893
Step two: Gaslight.

19:47.436 --> 19:51.064
Gia: Rue,
when you do drugs...

19:51.148 --> 19:55.319
it's not like when
other people do drugs.

20:00.824 --> 20:02.868
It's better than
committing suicide.

20:05.203 --> 20:07.331
When I'm sober,
that's what I think about.

20:08.832 --> 20:10.417
That's where I'm at, Gia.

20:11.627 --> 20:12.794
Okay?

20:13.587 --> 20:15.047
That's where I'm at.

20:16.381 --> 20:19.635
Now, if you
wanna tell Mom,
you can tell her...

20:19.718 --> 20:21.803
but I don't know what
else I can fuckin' do.

20:29.061 --> 20:30.395
Rue...

20:32.105 --> 20:34.316
I love you...

20:34.399 --> 20:37.945
so, please,
just promise me,

20:38.028 --> 20:40.697
it's just gonna be
weed and nothing more.

20:54.419 --> 20:55.545
I promise.

20:59.591 --> 21:02.386
So, the next time you
put Pop-Tarts in the fridge,

21:02.469 --> 21:07.224
or milk in the cupboard...
you have a motherfuckin' out.

21:07.307 --> 21:08.934
(blows bubbles,
muffled singing)

21:09.017 --> 21:10.060
Rue?

21:11.687 --> 21:13.313
Are you high?

21:14.189 --> 21:15.774
I mean.

21:15.857 --> 21:18.527
I just smoked
a little bit of weed.

21:18.610 --> 21:21.321
-Wait, what?
-Ow!

21:23.657 --> 21:26.827
Please, you keep going.
I'm just gonna sit
here for a second.

21:26.910 --> 21:29.246
So, I smoked
a little bit of weed,

21:29.329 --> 21:32.416
and forgot to mention
someone that I met.

21:32.499 --> 21:35.293
By the way,
I think you would
really get along with

21:35.377 --> 21:37.713
once you're not mad
at me for whatever...

21:37.796 --> 21:39.506
you're fuckin'
mad at me about.

21:39.589 --> 21:42.217
I'm not gonna
get along with him.

21:42.300 --> 21:45.846
-Why?
-'Cause he wants to fuck you.

21:45.929 --> 21:49.057
-You really think so?
-Yes, I know so.

21:49.141 --> 21:50.726
No.
I promise you,

21:50.809 --> 21:53.145
there is no way
that he wants to fuck me.

21:54.396 --> 21:55.647
No way.

21:57.566 --> 21:58.900
Do you wanna fuck Rue?

21:59.985 --> 22:02.529
-Not no.
-Jules: So, you're straight?

22:02.612 --> 22:04.656
-Kinda.
-Jules: Are you gay?

22:05.532 --> 22:07.993
-Kinda.
-So, you're bi.

22:08.076 --> 22:09.619
-Well, I don't think
of it that way.
-What do you mean?

22:09.703 --> 22:12.205
You've never,
like, thought about
your sexuality before?

22:12.289 --> 22:15.250
Elliot:
Not in a particularly
rigid way, no.

22:15.333 --> 22:17.252
Have you guys fucked?
Is that a thing?

22:17.336 --> 22:19.671
Elliot, I'm asking
the fucking question.

22:19.755 --> 22:22.007
-Why did she
avoid that question?
-Yeah, why did you

22:22.090 --> 22:23.383
dodge the question?

22:24.342 --> 22:25.510
How many girls
have you fucked?

22:25.594 --> 22:28.138
Elliot:
Like, technically, three.

22:28.221 --> 22:30.932
-Technically?
-Elliot: I mean,
technically, the first girl,

22:31.016 --> 22:34.102
it was, like, two seconds.
It was embarrassing.

22:34.186 --> 22:37.689
She probably
wouldn't count it.
She would not count it.

22:37.773 --> 22:39.399
Okay, uh, how many
guys have you fucked?

22:39.483 --> 22:42.152
-43.
-Are you serious?

22:42.235 --> 22:43.737
-Damn.
-I'm kidding.

22:43.820 --> 22:44.946
How many guys
have you fucked?

22:45.030 --> 22:46.031
She doesn't wanna
answer that question

22:46.114 --> 22:47.741
'cause she's
kind of a whore.

22:47.824 --> 22:48.950
Jules and Elliot:
A whore?!

22:49.034 --> 22:50.911
Slut. She's a slut.
I was gonna say slut,

22:50.994 --> 22:51.995
but then whore
just kinda came out.

22:52.079 --> 22:53.497
Wait, how many guys
have you fucked?

22:53.580 --> 22:56.333
You know,
that is an excellent
question, Jules.

22:56.416 --> 22:58.335
-How many guys
have you been with?
-Uh-uh. No.

22:58.418 --> 23:00.128
No, it's not
an excellent question.

23:00.212 --> 23:02.214
In fact, it's an irrelevant
question 'cause

23:02.297 --> 23:04.216
I'm no longer
interested in men, so.

23:04.299 --> 23:05.801
Well, how many men
do you have to fuck

23:05.884 --> 23:07.636
to no longer be
interested in them?

23:07.719 --> 23:11.932
-Rue: Hmm.
-Uh, I'll tell you if you
promise to never tell Rue.

23:12.849 --> 23:14.476
Are you for real right now?

23:14.559 --> 23:16.311
-Elliot: Deal.
-What the fuck?

23:16.394 --> 23:17.687
Okay.

23:17.771 --> 23:20.857
-(Jules whispers)
-Wow! Really?

23:20.941 --> 23:24.277
That's fucked up.
That's like a mentally ill
amount of people to fuck.

23:24.361 --> 23:26.696
-What did she say?
-Elliot: No, that's, like...

23:26.780 --> 23:30.075
-that's, like, bad.
-Wait, do you really think so?

23:30.158 --> 23:32.577
No... I'm kidding.

23:32.661 --> 23:34.454
Who gives a shit?
Everyone's a fuckin' nun.

23:34.538 --> 23:35.622
-Nun?
-Elliot: You're a nun.

23:35.705 --> 23:37.457
-How am I a nun?
-Elliot: You're a trans girl

23:37.541 --> 23:40.085
wearing a binder asking me
whether I'm straight or gay?

23:40.168 --> 23:43.171
Well, I'm navigating
a largely straight,
binary world--

23:43.255 --> 23:44.965
You sound like
you're navigating
a Twitter thread.

23:45.048 --> 23:46.466
I don't know what
that's supposed to mean.

23:46.550 --> 23:48.343
But you know what I mean,
like most people are straight.

23:48.426 --> 23:50.971
And most trans girls
don't wear binders, right?

23:51.054 --> 23:52.347
Yeah, and, uh, most guys

23:52.430 --> 23:54.224
don't hang out with two girls
unless they wanna fuck them.

23:54.307 --> 23:56.476
I didn't say that I didn't
wanna fuck you or Rue.

23:56.560 --> 23:57.978
So, you wanna fuck Jules?

23:59.521 --> 24:01.189
You guys are disgusting.

24:01.273 --> 24:04.776
I'm not out here
swingin' my muff around
waitin' to see who fucks it.

24:04.860 --> 24:07.404
-Okay?
-I don't like you.

24:07.487 --> 24:09.823
-Why?
-Jules: 'Cause you're
being sarcastic,

24:09.906 --> 24:12.534
-and I don't like
sarcastic people.
-Rue: Wait, aren't I sarcastic?

24:12.617 --> 24:14.786
-No, no, you're the opposite.
-Elliot: All right,

24:14.870 --> 24:17.497
I'm being sarcastic
because I'm uncomfortable,

24:17.581 --> 24:20.584
and the questions
are, like, fuckin'
hypocritical, you know,

24:20.667 --> 24:22.335
and I genuinely
do like Rue.

24:22.419 --> 24:24.087
And, you know,
even though you've
been gangbanged

24:24.171 --> 24:27.048
by the entire galaxy,
you're still fuckin'--
You're great.

24:27.132 --> 24:29.718
Okay? And I want to be friends.

24:30.802 --> 24:32.804
You think he's
being sarcastic?

24:36.516 --> 24:38.268
Unfortunately, no.

24:41.438 --> 24:43.273
-Jules: Come on!
-Rue: You're too fast!

24:43.356 --> 24:46.359
(laughs)
You're just fucking slow.
I don't know.

24:46.443 --> 24:49.487
-Rue (groans): I don't play
sports for a reason!
-Come on!

24:54.075 --> 24:55.243
Fuck.

Fuck.

25:20.727 --> 25:23.855
-Oh, you motherfucker.

25:23.939 --> 25:25.649

care of that asthma.

25:27.984 --> 25:29.736
-good at that kind of stuff.
-(Jules chuckles)

25:29.819 --> 25:32.906
-Oh man. Let me catch my breath.
-Oh, I'm sorry.

25:32.989 --> 25:34.241

26:12.445 --> 26:13.697
Okay.

26:22.872 --> 26:25.166
Rue:
The beautiful thing
about getting high

26:25.250 --> 26:27.377
is time ceases to exist.

26:31.923 --> 26:34.009
I mean, you can just
stay in the good moments

26:34.092 --> 26:36.386
without the fear that
they'll come to an end.

you guys played
truth or dare?

27:17.010 --> 27:20.180
Vice Principal Garcia, hi.
My name is Lexi Howard.

27:20.263 --> 27:21.765
I know who you are, Lexi.

27:21.848 --> 27:24.059
Right, sorry,
that was weird, um.

27:24.142 --> 27:25.852
Anyway,
I'm writing this play,

27:25.935 --> 27:28.813
and I was wondering
if I could put it on...

27:28.897 --> 27:32.317
Rue:
After all that stuff with Cal
at Fezco's convenience store,

27:32.400 --> 27:34.527
Lexi realized
there was a reason

27:34.611 --> 27:36.654
she never tried
to intervene before.

27:37.906 --> 27:39.866
She was an observer.

27:39.949 --> 27:41.576
That's who she was.

27:41.659 --> 27:44.412
(inaudible)

27:44.496 --> 27:48.708
She often imagined
that her parents weren't
really her parents...

27:48.792 --> 27:51.127
and that her sister
wasn't her sister,

27:51.211 --> 27:54.089
and that her house wasn't
even really her house.

27:55.673 --> 27:57.509
That it was just a movie...

27:57.592 --> 28:00.095

I, I told you.
I didn't promise you that.

28:11.689 --> 28:13.149
Lexi, I need to talk
to you about this scene.

28:13.233 --> 28:15.151
Thanks.

28:15.235 --> 28:16.736

28:39.384 --> 28:41.344
The story is about
a 16-year-old girl,

28:41.428 --> 28:46.099
Grace, who lives in the shadow
of her older sister, Hallie.

28:46.182 --> 28:47.308
Sluttier.

28:48.184 --> 28:49.310
And tackier.

28:51.396 --> 28:52.689
Sloppier.

28:52.772 --> 28:54.274
But the story
isn't about Hallie.

28:54.357 --> 28:56.276
You know,
that's been done before.

28:56.359 --> 28:57.444
It's about Grace.

28:57.527 --> 29:00.822
Here, come with me.

29:05.285 --> 29:06.619
more compelling characters,

29:06.703 --> 29:09.414
but for some reason,
they just get overlooked.

I love that I'm your secret...

39:16.353 --> 39:17.897
and I can't tell a soul.

39:20.608 --> 39:22.860
I love how fuckin'
sick you are.

39:30.076 --> 39:33.412
(both moaning)

39:33.496 --> 39:36.332
(muffled moans)

39:38.501 --> 39:41.212
What I wouldn't give
to be back in high school.

39:41.295 --> 39:43.714
(moaning continues)

39:43.798 --> 39:45.091
Yeah.

39:47.802 --> 39:49.136
Yeah.

39:49.220 --> 39:51.972
Rue:
Meanwhile, Kat was having
dinner with Ethan's parents.

39:52.056 --> 39:53.808
Judy:
So, who's my son with?

39:53.891 --> 39:56.143
Oh, she's got
the cutest smile,
doesn't she?

39:56.227 --> 39:57.394
-Yeah.
-Adorable.

39:57.478 --> 39:59.480
-Ethan: Mom, stop.
-So, Katherine...

39:59.563 --> 40:01.440
Tell me about yourself.

40:03.025 --> 40:06.946
Uh, (awkward laughter)

40:07.029 --> 40:08.823
Rue:
Kat got nervous because
she could feel that

40:08.906 --> 40:11.283
there were right answers
and wrong answers.

40:11.367 --> 40:15.329
Who am I?
(laughs) Oof.

40:15.413 --> 40:18.415
Wow. Wow, wow,
wow, wow, wow.
Um...

40:18.499 --> 40:23.003
I mean, that's, like,
a really big question.

40:23.087 --> 40:25.297
Well, I guess, who am I
is a very different question

40:25.381 --> 40:27.466
than tell me
about yourself, right?

40:28.634 --> 40:30.386
Uh...

40:30.469 --> 40:36.725
I mean, I'm, like,
kinda trying to just...
figure it out myself.

40:36.809 --> 40:38.144
You know, like...

40:41.230 --> 40:43.440
I mean, I guess I just, I...

40:43.524 --> 40:45.734
literally, have
no idea who I am.

40:45.818 --> 40:48.362
(awkward laughter)

40:52.491 --> 40:55.327
Wow...
Wasn't that illuminating.

40:57.246 --> 40:58.914
(Judy laughs)

40:58.998 --> 41:03.419
Rue:
Kat wanted to crawl into
a hole and fucking die.

41:03.502 --> 41:05.880
And so did Cal,
who hadn't been
able to sleep

41:05.963 --> 41:08.215
since Nate told him
about that disc.

41:08.299 --> 41:09.550
(bottles clattering)

41:09.633 --> 41:11.385
Nate:
You want a water?

41:14.972 --> 41:17.641
Rue: And every time
he'd close his eyes,
he'd imagine...

41:17.725 --> 41:20.519
Aaron, tell your dad
dinner's ready!

41:20.603 --> 41:22.354
Dad, dinner's ready!

41:23.564 --> 41:24.899
(gunshot)

41:27.276 --> 41:29.361
Rue:
But Cal wasn't raised that way.

41:35.284 --> 41:37.536
He wouldn't go down
without a fight.

41:41.207 --> 41:44.376
(tense music playing)

41:48.589 --> 41:53.510
Hi... I'm Rue.
Um, good to see you, uh.

41:53.594 --> 41:57.389
I would love to present you
with a, a business opportunity.

41:58.724 --> 41:59.808
Okay.

42:01.560 --> 42:03.979
-You want some?
-Oh, I'm okay. Thank you.

42:06.273 --> 42:09.401
Uh, (clears throat)
ever since I, I, I met you
at New Year's,

42:09.485 --> 42:13.572
I was, I was thinking,
um, that...

42:13.656 --> 42:15.324
maybe, you--

42:16.575 --> 42:17.660
um...

42:20.371 --> 42:21.872
um...

42:21.956 --> 42:24.416
uh... I'm in high school, right?

42:24.500 --> 42:27.628
Uh, and I have
a GPA of 3.95,

42:27.711 --> 42:31.131
and let's say,
you know, all my friends
Jamie, Amy, and Lanie

42:31.215 --> 42:33.342
also have
a GPA over 3.7.

42:33.425 --> 42:35.552
-Laurie: Hmm.
-Rue: And, and, Laurie,
these are, these are girls

42:35.636 --> 42:39.390
that you would never
expect in a million years
to be selling.

42:40.391 --> 42:41.976
Hmm.

42:42.059 --> 42:46.939
Look, I'm a dreamer, you know,
and, and Steve Jobs is my hero.

42:47.022 --> 42:52.778
And I was just thinking,
you know, what if there was
a foolproof system to sell...

42:54.029 --> 42:57.950
you know, (chuckles)
without anyone snitching.

42:58.033 --> 43:00.786
-Hmm.
-Rue: So, let's say...

43:00.869 --> 43:02.246
hypothetically,
of course, uh,

43:02.329 --> 43:04.790
we were able to pay
Jamie, Amy, and Lanie

43:04.873 --> 43:06.292
$500 a month to be runners.

43:06.375 --> 43:07.793
Now as collateral,
we would upload

43:07.876 --> 43:09.837
-their phones to
a cloud that I own.
-(bird vocalizes)

43:09.920 --> 43:13.090
-Why would you want that?
-Ah, that's a good
question, Laurie.

43:13.173 --> 43:14.550
May I?

43:14.633 --> 43:16.010
Uh, well, you see...

43:16.093 --> 43:18.345
even though Jamie, Amy,
and Lanie have stellar GPAs,

43:18.429 --> 43:19.888
there's also things
on their phones

43:19.972 --> 43:21.015
that they don't want
the world to know about

43:21.098 --> 43:22.725
because it would
probably jeopardize

43:22.808 --> 43:25.394
their ability to get into
Yale, Columbia, Harvard,

43:25.477 --> 43:26.729
my top choices, uh.

43:26.812 --> 43:29.273
Plus, uh, if they
ever got busted,

43:29.356 --> 43:31.525
we're lookin' at
6 to 12 months in juvie.

43:31.608 --> 43:34.820
Intent to sell is
a way bigger sentence.

43:34.903 --> 43:35.946
(bird squawks)

43:36.030 --> 43:38.157
Not if you're under 18.

43:38.240 --> 43:39.658
-Hmm.
-Which is nothing to having

43:39.742 --> 43:41.869
your entire life released
and ruined on the internet,

43:41.952 --> 43:44.747
so their incentive to snitch
is basically reduced to zero.

43:47.833 --> 43:50.210
This is an amazing plan.

43:51.128 --> 43:52.880
You're a genius.

43:54.089 --> 43:56.508
-Thank you.
-Laurie: It's true.

43:56.592 --> 43:59.720
I'll front you
a 50k suitcase.

44:02.139 --> 44:04.516
Rue: Don't do it.
You're too much of a fuck-up.

44:04.600 --> 44:07.895
-Maybe we should start smaller.
-10k?

44:07.978 --> 44:09.188
Deal.

44:09.271 --> 44:10.647
That was very mature, Rue.

44:10.731 --> 44:12.900
Laurie:
If you pay each
girl a thousand,

44:12.983 --> 44:16.320
you can flip it for 20,
and that's 7k profit.

44:16.403 --> 44:21.241
-Three to me. Four to you.
-Uh, thank you, Laurie.
You won't regret this.

44:21.325 --> 44:24.703
-Laurie: You pay-up
and re-up in a month.
-Uh, terrific.

44:24.787 --> 44:27.247
Rue, if you screw me,

44:27.331 --> 44:31.377
I'll have you
kidnapped and sold
to some real sick people.

44:32.795 --> 44:35.381
I always find a way
to make my money back.

44:39.385 --> 44:41.637
I'm serious.

44:43.055 --> 44:44.098
Okay.

What the fuck you doin'?

45:10.374 --> 45:13.544
Rue:
Lexi knew she couldn't
mount a play all on her own,

45:13.627 --> 45:15.129
so she enlisted
the help of Bobbi

45:15.212 --> 45:17.589
as her stage manager
and partner in crime.

45:17.673 --> 45:19.258
They didn't know
each other well,

45:19.341 --> 45:21.885
except that they
shared a mutual disdain
for "Oklahoma."

45:21.969 --> 45:26.390
-Bobbi, you okay?
-Fuck "Oklahoma."

45:28.350 --> 45:30.811
Are they all
here to audition?

45:30.894 --> 45:32.938
Are you all
here to audition?

45:33.021 --> 45:34.606

Yes.

45:34.690 --> 45:36.608
They're all
here to audition.

45:36.692 --> 45:39.653
Right, yeah, that's,
that's what I thought.

45:39.736 --> 45:42.114
Put yourselves into
a single-file line.

45:42.197 --> 45:44.283
We'll be with you momentarily.

45:46.869 --> 45:49.621
So first, you come
to my fuckin' job

45:49.705 --> 45:53.208
askin' all these weird-ass
questions like the feds.

45:53.292 --> 45:55.669
Then I find you
out in front of my house.

45:55.752 --> 45:57.296
What the fuck
are you doin', man?

45:57.379 --> 45:59.840
You're free to call the cops.

45:59.923 --> 46:02.301
Fezco:
Why the fuck
would I do that?

46:02.384 --> 46:06.221
Well, it's either call the cops,
let me go or... kill me.

46:06.305 --> 46:09.433
Fezco:
What the fuck, man?
What's with your family?

46:09.516 --> 46:11.768
Are you all just a bunch
of fuckin' assholes?

46:11.852 --> 46:15.397
-Cal: You beat up my son.
-Yeah, well,
he deserved it, man.

46:15.481 --> 46:16.982
He's a fuckin' bitch.

46:17.065 --> 46:18.942
Oh, okay, tough guy.

46:19.026 --> 46:21.320
Ow, fuck!

46:23.363 --> 46:24.406
Why did you do that?

46:24.490 --> 46:26.825
'Cause you're in no
position to talk shit.

46:26.909 --> 46:29.036
I'm warning you.
You hit me one more--

46:29.119 --> 46:33.081
-Oh, fuck!
-Why don't you call the cops?

46:33.165 --> 46:36.001
-The Chief of Police,
Will Greenwood--
-Mm-hm.

46:36.084 --> 46:39.046
-(Cal grunts)
-All right, Ash. Chill out, man.

46:39.129 --> 46:42.508
-Cal: Fuck!
-This guy don't want
the fuckin' cops involved.

46:42.591 --> 46:44.009
Watch.

46:46.094 --> 46:48.972
-Call the cops.
-I will.

46:50.140 --> 46:53.101
-Dial, bitch.
-(Cal grunts)

46:53.185 --> 46:56.021
If you got nothin' to hide,
call the fuckin' cops.

46:59.608 --> 47:02.528
-Stop, stop, stop.
-I'm not fucking stopping.

47:02.611 --> 47:04.613
I'm not stopping.
Call the cops.

47:09.409 --> 47:13.539
-I told you.
-All right, man. I get it.

47:13.622 --> 47:15.791
Cal:
I know you and your
drug addict friend,

47:15.874 --> 47:17.584
that girl.

47:19.002 --> 47:21.421
You're trying to extort my son.

47:21.505 --> 47:25.092
-What?
-Because of what
I did to her friend.

47:25.175 --> 47:27.261
Fezco:
What the fuck are you
talkin' about, man?

47:27.344 --> 47:30.681
-You know, the blonde.
-Who? Jewel?

47:32.391 --> 47:35.102
Look, man, I didn't
know she was 17.

47:38.063 --> 47:40.732
You tellin' me you
had sex with Jewel?

47:40.816 --> 47:42.150
Who's Jewel?

47:42.234 --> 47:45.404
-Fezco: What the fuck, man?
-Faye: Do I know Jewel?

47:45.487 --> 47:48.615
Fezco:
The fuck are we even
talkin' about right now, bro?

47:48.699 --> 47:49.616
Jewel.

47:50.492 --> 47:52.327
Jewel. Jewel...

47:52.411 --> 47:54.413
I just want the disc.

47:54.496 --> 47:58.041
-Fezco: What disc?!
-Of Jewel and I.

47:58.125 --> 48:00.127
Yo, you recorded that shit?!

48:00.210 --> 48:04.298
-Cal: I didn't know.
-You didn't know that
you were recording?

48:04.381 --> 48:07.426
-I fucked up.
-Fezco: Obviously, man.

48:07.509 --> 48:11.388
Yo, who the fuck even
told you I gave a shit
about this anyway?

48:11.471 --> 48:13.140
My son.

48:13.223 --> 48:15.726
Your son?
The one that's
in love with Jewel?

48:15.809 --> 48:17.811
Faye:
Aw, that's cute.

48:17.894 --> 48:20.314
Fezco:
That's not cute, man.
What the fuck?

48:20.397 --> 48:22.107
-What?
-Fezco: What kind of weird-ass

48:22.190 --> 48:25.235
father-son shit is goin'
on around here, bro?

48:27.696 --> 48:30.407
-I'm extremely confused.
-Fezco: You're confused.

48:30.490 --> 48:32.576
I'm fuckin' confused, bro.

48:32.659 --> 48:36.872
-Me too.
-Fezco: I don't even know what
the fuck you're doin' here.

48:36.955 --> 48:39.666
Do you mind if I just leave?

48:39.750 --> 48:42.794
I'm not gonna say
a word about anything,
I swear to God.

48:42.878 --> 48:46.798
Let's just pretend like...
none of this ever happened.

48:48.884 --> 48:51.011
Yo, Ash, let me talk
to you real quick.

48:53.847 --> 48:57.100
Hi... what's your name?

48:58.477 --> 48:59.853
Cal.

49:01.438 --> 49:03.273
Do you and your son, like--

49:03.357 --> 49:07.653
Do you, like,
fuck people together?

49:07.736 --> 49:09.613
Fezco:
Yo, check it out, man.

49:09.696 --> 49:12.199
I'mma let you
walk up outta here
on one condition.

49:12.991 --> 49:14.785
Anything.

49:14.868 --> 49:18.622
You'll keep your
bitch-ass son out
of my fuckin' life,

49:18.705 --> 49:20.832
and Rue's and Jewel's,

49:20.916 --> 49:23.877
till the end of fucking time.
You understand?

49:23.960 --> 49:25.504
I promise.

49:25.587 --> 49:29.758
Now, I don't know shit
about no fuckin' disc, man.
That's not my problem.

49:33.303 --> 49:36.723
Now get this motherfucker
up outta here, Ash.

49:40.310 --> 49:41.395
(grunts)

49:57.494 --> 50:00.038
(strumming guitar)

50:09.506 --> 50:11.967
Why can't I shake
the feeling that
there's, like,

50:12.050 --> 50:14.386
something you're
not telling me.

50:15.554 --> 50:16.930
I don't know.

50:18.348 --> 50:19.933
Like, why don't I trust you?

50:22.018 --> 50:23.437
Is it the face tats?

50:23.520 --> 50:27.899
No, (chuckles)...
No, it's not the face tats.

50:27.983 --> 50:29.443
Elliot:
Okay, what is it?

50:33.113 --> 50:38.785
These are the kind of things...
that can cause you to relapse.

50:38.869 --> 50:42.289
This is not easy,
but I'm very proud

50:42.372 --> 50:47.127
of each and every one of you
for trying to take this on.

50:47.210 --> 50:51.506
Work this program.
It will work if you work it.

50:55.135 --> 50:56.678
Do you have a crush on Rue?

50:56.762 --> 50:58.388
(guitar stops)

50:59.723 --> 51:00.974
I do.

51:07.022 --> 51:09.691
Speaker:
I was a little bit
ashamed of myself

51:09.775 --> 51:12.611
that I didn't wanna be
around other people

51:12.694 --> 51:16.865
with this awful,
awful habit.

51:16.948 --> 51:20.076
Because it's
no future in addiction.

51:20.160 --> 51:21.953
I don't care
what they tell you.

51:22.037 --> 51:25.248
Addiction will
take you out.

51:25.332 --> 51:28.376
I feel like Rue
doesn't want to fuck me.

51:29.795 --> 51:31.379
Why don't you think so?

51:32.589 --> 51:34.508
She seems like...

51:34.591 --> 51:37.761
gay... or asexual,
you know?

51:37.844 --> 51:41.056
Like she's not really
interested... in sex.

51:41.139 --> 51:42.766
That's not true.

51:42.849 --> 51:44.768
Elliot:
Really?

51:44.851 --> 51:46.478
No, that's not true at all.

51:46.561 --> 51:48.688
You think Rue's,
like, a sexual person?

51:48.772 --> 51:51.650
Jules:
I mean, at times, yeah.

51:51.733 --> 51:52.943
Yeah, you're full of shit.

51:53.026 --> 51:54.569
It's true!

51:54.653 --> 51:56.571
Elliot:
I feel like you've fucked
way too many people

51:56.655 --> 51:57.823
to look me in the face,

51:57.906 --> 51:59.282
and lie to me
and say she's some

51:59.366 --> 52:01.326
sexual force of nature.

52:03.995 --> 52:08.625
Fine. No, she's not, like,
the most sexual person ever.

52:09.584 --> 52:11.294
Elliot:
Then how does that work?

52:11.378 --> 52:14.297
-What do you mean?
-'Cause you're, like,
a sexual person?

52:14.381 --> 52:17.133
Jules:
Not all the time,
but sometimes.

52:22.806 --> 52:26.893
Fine...
No, okay, she's not
a sexual person.

52:26.977 --> 52:28.436
Or, like, maybe, she is a bit.

52:28.520 --> 52:30.605
I just haven't seen
that side yet.

52:32.107 --> 52:34.693
Elliot:
I wouldn't blame yourself.

52:34.776 --> 52:36.695
-I'm not.
-I'm just saying it's, like,

52:36.778 --> 52:39.364
easy to take that
kind of stuff personally.

52:39.447 --> 52:42.033
Are you, like, trying
to be an asshole right now?

52:42.117 --> 52:44.578
-I'm being sweet right now.
-Jules: How is that sweet?

52:44.661 --> 52:48.582
'Cause you're very
fuckin' fuckable.

52:48.665 --> 52:52.002
-Why?
-Elliot: I mean,
you're fascinating, right?

52:52.085 --> 52:54.588
'Cause you're creative
and you're smart,

52:54.671 --> 52:56.464
and you're kind of fucked up.

52:56.548 --> 53:00.218
But you're cute,
and you're awkward,
and you're like...

53:00.302 --> 53:02.429
kind of clumsy
but you're very much a whore,

53:02.512 --> 53:04.848
intentionally, which is great.

53:04.931 --> 53:08.018
You know, you're like
extroverted and weird,

53:08.101 --> 53:10.770
but also
introverted and shy...

53:10.854 --> 53:13.315
and your art is amazing.

53:13.398 --> 53:15.734
They should hang it up
at fuckin' MoMA.

53:15.817 --> 53:17.736
But on like a more
superficial note,

53:17.819 --> 53:19.404
you have great tits.

53:19.487 --> 53:22.365
And you and Kurt Cobain
have the same haircut...

53:23.241 --> 53:24.492
which is hot.

53:27.412 --> 53:28.705
Give me that.

53:33.501 --> 53:35.670
Elliot:
But I'm sure Rue
told you all that.

53:37.839 --> 53:39.424
You guys are in love, right?

53:40.842 --> 53:44.471
(light music playing)

53:44.554 --> 53:45.764
Shut up.

53:53.939 --> 53:59.235
So, Rue,
the $64,000 question is...

53:59.319 --> 54:02.238
what's in the suitcase?

54:02.322 --> 54:05.241
-School books.
-Ah, is that why
you're in that getup?

54:05.325 --> 54:07.285
You became
an honors student.

54:07.369 --> 54:09.204
-I'm not in the mood
for a lecture.
-Lecture?

54:09.287 --> 54:12.624
-I... like to think
we have conversations.
-Rue: Yeah, I'm sure you do.

54:12.707 --> 54:15.251
Okay, what?
Did a hornet crawl up
your ass or somethin'?

54:15.335 --> 54:16.711
-What's wrong with you?
-Look, I'm-- Man,

54:16.795 --> 54:18.463
I'm not tryin' to hear
a fuckin' lecture, okay,

54:18.546 --> 54:21.716
about how my life would be
better if I stopped doing drugs,

54:21.800 --> 54:24.177
or believed in God, or Allah,
or whatever the fuck.

54:24.260 --> 54:25.929
Okay, well,
you're the one lookin'
like a Jehovah's Witness.

54:26.012 --> 54:28.974
I just don't think that there's,
uh, Bibles in that suitcase.

54:29.057 --> 54:32.602
-Shut the fuck up, man.
-Wait, wait, wait. Excuse me?

54:32.686 --> 54:33.687
Shut the fuck up?

54:33.770 --> 54:36.022
Don't play that
shit with me.

54:36.106 --> 54:37.691
I've always accepted you
for who you are:

54:37.774 --> 54:39.693
the good, the bad,
and the ugly.

54:39.776 --> 54:41.778
Don't tell me
to shut the fuck up.
I'm not some parent

54:41.861 --> 54:42.946
you can just
treat like shit.

54:43.029 --> 54:44.280
Yeah, well, good thing
nobody's really

54:44.364 --> 54:46.825
lookin' to you
to be a fuckin' parent.

54:46.908 --> 54:49.035
Yo! Excuse me?

54:51.079 --> 54:52.414
Excuse me?

54:53.456 --> 54:55.250
(scoffs)

54:55.333 --> 54:58.128
When I sit across from you
and tell you somethin'
about my life,

54:58.211 --> 55:00.171
you don't get to use
that shit against me.

55:00.255 --> 55:02.882
You cross that line again,
we're done.

55:02.966 --> 55:04.884
You talk back right now,
we're done.

55:04.968 --> 55:07.053
One more fuckin' disrespectful
word outta your mouth,

55:07.137 --> 55:08.680
and we're done.
You hear me?

55:09.806 --> 55:11.599
(shouts):
Hey! You hear me?!

55:14.352 --> 55:16.021
