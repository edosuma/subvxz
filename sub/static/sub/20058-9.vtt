Yes!

00:16.625 --> 00:20.250
Of course, fighting skills,
agility, honor and fair play

00:20.333 --> 00:24.292
are all important aspects
of what it means to be a Skylander.

00:24.375 --> 00:25.708
But today, cadets,

00:25.792 --> 00:29.625
I want to discuss another
important quality...

00:30.458 --> 00:31.958
proper grooming.

00:32.042 --> 00:35.000
I'm missing the thousand-yard stare class
right now for this?

00:35.083 --> 00:38.125
If you'll allow me to elaborate,
I think I'll--

00:39.958 --> 00:42.208
-You think you'll what, sir?
-Sorry?

00:42.292 --> 00:45.333
You just froze in place for a few seconds.

00:45.417 --> 00:48.458
-So... you were saying?
-There's no time.

00:50.250 --> 00:52.667
You guys think this counts
as our elective?

01:22.917 --> 01:24.625
Finally.

01:24.708 --> 01:30.333
Years of cultivating the most
intense smelling strains will pay off.

01:30.417 --> 01:32.500
Not so fast, Broccoli Guy!

01:32.583 --> 01:33.958
Eon!

01:34.042 --> 01:38.208
How could you possibly
have known about my diabolical plan?

01:38.292 --> 01:39.292
I didn't.

01:39.375 --> 01:43.375
But when my beard sense tingles,
I know there's menace afoot and you...

01:45.708 --> 01:46.917
Well, you sort of qualify.

01:47.000 --> 01:50.292
Well, we'll just see about that.

01:50.375 --> 01:53.458
Yes. I think we will.

01:53.542 --> 01:54.875
By my beard!

01:54.958 --> 01:58.000
I say... Yah!
Beardy Chop!

01:58.083 --> 02:00.167
And now there's a... Ha-yah!

02:00.833 --> 02:03.125
Way to go!

02:03.208 --> 02:05.958
Okay, that was awesome!

02:06.042 --> 02:08.417
I guess now we know
why you're running the place.

02:08.500 --> 02:09.875
Well, I couldn't do it alone.

02:09.958 --> 02:12.958
My well-coiffed beard
deserves some of the credit.

02:13.042 --> 02:17.375
And, as I was going to explain earlier,
just as I have my beard,

02:17.458 --> 02:21.167
each of you have
something unique about yourselves.

02:21.250 --> 02:24.375
Embrace it and it can become
a source of great power.

02:24.458 --> 02:27.458
Hmm. Unique, huh?

02:27.542 --> 02:29.208
I don't have a body.

02:29.292 --> 02:31.333
I wonder if there's something to that.

02:31.417 --> 02:34.708
Ooh, I can go nonstop for 48 hours
on a single wind-up.

02:34.792 --> 02:37.167
I have an uncanny sense of balance.

02:39.417 --> 02:43.333
I can resist my natural urges to keep
from turning people into undead servants.

02:43.417 --> 02:44.500
-Mmm.
-Ugh.

02:44.583 --> 02:46.000
You get the idea.

02:48.875 --> 02:50.083
Definitely
the red wire, right?

02:50.167 --> 02:52.583
I don't know.
I mean, red seems like the obvious choice,

02:52.667 --> 02:54.583
so... maybe that means
we should pick blue?

02:54.667 --> 02:55.958
But if they knew we'd think that,

02:56.042 --> 02:58.500
they'd expect us to pick blue,
so we should pick red.

02:58.583 --> 03:00.208
Unless they thought of that, too.

03:00.292 --> 03:02.208
-In which case we should pick--
-I can't take it anymore.

03:05.875 --> 03:09.167
I wanna help you three
get your bomb defusing certification,

03:09.250 --> 03:13.208
but working with live explosives
in the library may have been a mistake.

03:13.292 --> 03:15.083
- What's going on here?
- Hello, Captain.

03:15.167 --> 03:17.292
We're just rounding out
our team's skill set.

03:17.375 --> 03:18.583
Nothing too serious.

03:18.667 --> 03:21.125
Yep.
Nothing to see here.

03:21.208 --> 03:25.750
So, Eon, I heard you took down
Broccoli Guy single-beardedly.

03:25.833 --> 03:27.625
How do you fight someone with your beard?

03:27.708 --> 03:31.833
I suppose now is as good a time
as any to demonstrate...

03:31.917 --> 03:34.500
beard fu. Ha-yah!

03:35.167 --> 03:37.000
The Goatee! Yah!

03:37.708 --> 03:39.250
The Van Dyke!

03:41.583 --> 03:43.292
The Soul Patch!

03:44.500 --> 03:48.583
Yeah, uh, beard moves are pretty much
off the table for rock creatures.

03:48.667 --> 03:51.125
So, all your power
comes from your beard?

03:51.208 --> 03:53.875
I just assumed you had
vast magical resources at your command.

03:53.958 --> 03:57.375
Oh, I do.
But my beard has a magic all its own.

03:57.458 --> 03:59.042
Long ago,

03:59.125 --> 04:02.292
I failed when my powers
were needed most.

04:03.792 --> 04:07.333
I swore then that I would never leave
the fate of the Skylands

04:07.417 --> 04:09.250
to just one wizard.

04:09.333 --> 04:11.667
That's when I decided
to start a school.

04:11.750 --> 04:12.792
Hmm.

04:12.875 --> 04:14.375
As you can probably guess,

04:14.458 --> 04:17.541
founding an academy to train
protectors of the realm is no easy task.

04:17.625 --> 04:18.916
Things fall through the cracks.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.416
For me,
it was shaving on a daily basis.

04:21.500 --> 04:25.708
But the longer my beard grew,
the larger our school became.

04:25.792 --> 04:29.375
Until it blossomed into the great academy
you know today.

04:29.458 --> 04:32.833
If that isn't magical,
I don't know what is.

04:32.917 --> 04:35.958
Wow. Your beard is like
the heart of the academy.

04:36.042 --> 04:37.542
It's like our spirit animal.

04:37.625 --> 04:41.500
No! It's... our... mascot.

04:41.583 --> 04:47.167
Sometimes even I'm surprised
at how important a little hair can be.

04:49.250 --> 04:51.833
Give it a good shine, Glummy.
I want it to glow brighter

04:51.917 --> 04:54.625
than that time I dunked your head
in the toilet of toxic sludge.

04:54.708 --> 04:57.625
Thank you, sir.
It helps to have an image to work towards.

04:57.708 --> 04:59.000
Very nice.

04:59.083 --> 05:00.917
We may have found you another career.

05:01.000 --> 05:05.292
Wonderful, sir. I'll update my résumé
to include skull waxing.

05:05.375 --> 05:09.208
So, what's the occasion
for the... blinding shine, Master?

05:09.292 --> 05:10.917
The Golden Queen has asked me to lunch.

05:11.000 --> 05:14.833
It's our first date,
and I simply must look my absolute best!

05:16.542 --> 05:20.250
In a few hours, Goldie and I will be
the Skylands' newest celebrity couple.

05:20.333 --> 05:22.500
Ooh, we should have a name!

05:22.583 --> 05:23.958
Quee-Os!

05:24.042 --> 05:25.667
Ka-Queen!

05:25.750 --> 05:28.083
-K-Gold--
-Quiet! I have it!

05:28.167 --> 05:29.750
K-Gold!

05:29.833 --> 05:31.875
Oh, Glummy,
where would I be without me?

05:31.958 --> 05:33.833
Mind boggles, sir.

05:38.542 --> 05:40.500
Hey, there.
You're cute.

05:40.583 --> 05:43.000
I love me a silver fox with a curly 'do.

05:43.083 --> 05:44.083
Huh?

05:46.250 --> 05:47.958
Ugh, it's you!

05:48.042 --> 05:50.458
Now I have to go
wash my eyes out with soap.

05:57.458 --> 05:59.708
Look, Claire,
I'm not the only one growing it out.

05:59.792 --> 06:01.375
Man buns don't just appear.

06:01.458 --> 06:04.000
I need the raw material.

06:04.083 --> 06:06.292
This guy knows
what I'm talking about, right?

06:06.875 --> 06:09.583
Actually, I'm pretty sure
that style is played out.

06:09.667 --> 06:11.042
I'm sorry.

06:11.125 --> 06:14.958
A second ago, I thought you had hair
and was interested in what you had to say.

06:16.792 --> 06:17.833
Huh?

06:22.625 --> 06:24.958
You look like a discerning gentleman.

06:25.042 --> 06:28.000
Do you think thinning this bunch
would make me look more imposing?

06:28.083 --> 06:30.875
Honestly, there isn't anything
you can do about that.

06:30.958 --> 06:32.917
Oh, it's you.
Never mind.

06:33.000 --> 06:35.583
Your opinions
carry even less weight than mine.

06:35.667 --> 06:38.500
Uh, then why did you
ask me in the first place?

06:38.583 --> 06:40.708
I thought you had hair.

06:47.208 --> 06:50.375
To be honest,
it was curly until puberty.

06:50.458 --> 06:51.792
Then it just went straight.

06:51.875 --> 06:54.375
I'm actually
a little self-conscious about it.

06:54.458 --> 06:55.917
Oh, darling, trust me,

06:56.000 --> 06:59.833
you have nothing to be
self-conscious about.

06:59.917 --> 07:00.958
So...

07:01.042 --> 07:03.000
is this one of those
speed dating deals?

07:03.083 --> 07:04.958
Because I'm totally okay waiting my turn.

07:05.042 --> 07:08.042
What? Did you think I was asking you out?

07:08.125 --> 07:12.083
If I wanted to date
a bowling ball, I'd join a league.

07:12.167 --> 07:14.625
Ooh.
Burn.

07:14.708 --> 07:18.500
I asked you to come here so you
could see what a real man looks like.

07:18.583 --> 07:21.375
A man with glorious hair.

07:21.458 --> 07:24.167
I know she's just using me for my fur,

07:24.250 --> 07:26.125
but I really dig the food here.

07:26.208 --> 07:28.833
It's just so thick.

07:28.917 --> 07:31.250
I could get lost in there.

07:31.333 --> 07:33.667
Who's a good boy?
Oh, wait.

07:33.750 --> 07:35.625
-Uh, take a picture before you go.
-Hmm.

07:37.542 --> 07:38.625
Okay, hold on.

07:39.583 --> 07:41.625
Perfect.

07:46.208 --> 07:49.667
I said 14 inseam,
not 40.

07:49.750 --> 07:52.542
The bat mitzvah's in three days
and I'm swimming in this thing.

07:52.625 --> 07:54.500
What am I supposed to tell Moishe?

07:54.583 --> 07:56.917
Hello? Hello?

07:57.000 --> 07:59.083
Oh, you did not hang up on me.

07:59.167 --> 08:00.917
Burning the midnight oil, sir?

08:01.000 --> 08:03.875
Great suggestion, Glumshanks,
but I don't have time to annoy you.

08:03.958 --> 08:05.958
I'm too busy trying to cure baldness.

08:06.042 --> 08:09.458
Well, sir, I could recommend several
reputable hair transplant clinics nearby.

08:09.542 --> 08:11.542
Eureka!
I've found it!

08:11.625 --> 08:15.792
With this spell, I will have
the best hair in all the Skylands!

08:46.792 --> 08:49.750
My beard couldn't simply
vanish overnight on its own.

08:49.833 --> 08:51.958
I sense dark magic at work.

08:52.042 --> 08:53.917
All of the Skylands may be at risk.

08:54.000 --> 08:57.375
And without my beard,
I am ill-prepared to mount a defense.

08:57.458 --> 09:00.542
I'll be depending on all of you
more than ever.

09:00.625 --> 09:03.583
So, without further ado...

09:03.667 --> 09:07.250
Skylanders, unite!

09:07.333 --> 09:10.250
Okay, this time we'll cut a wire
and not swallow the whole thing.

09:10.333 --> 09:13.708
Or you could just do what I did
and get certified by default.

09:17.958 --> 09:19.125
Oh, awesome.

09:19.208 --> 09:20.583
That doesn't seem fair.

09:20.667 --> 09:22.792
Well, now we're out of time bombs,
so I hope you're happy.

09:22.875 --> 09:25.083
Skylanders, unite!

09:25.167 --> 09:28.833
Hey, maybe I can mix up
a time bomb-creating potion.

09:28.917 --> 09:30.958
Skylanders... unite.

09:31.042 --> 09:33.917
Yeah, I think checking out
another certification kit from the armory

09:34.000 --> 09:35.417
is the safer option.

09:36.750 --> 09:40.000
This is worse than I feared.

09:45.250 --> 09:46.292
Good morning, sir.

09:46.375 --> 09:49.792
I've brought the scalding hot beverage
to be thrown in my face.

09:50.792 --> 09:52.750
Ah!

09:52.833 --> 09:54.625
Normally, I'm all for scalding you,

09:54.708 --> 09:56.875
but for some reason today,
I feel like drinking it.

09:58.042 --> 10:00.917
My word, Glumshanks!
Do you make this concoction every day?

10:01.000 --> 10:04.542
-It is positively inspired.
-Oh, it's not much, sir.

10:04.625 --> 10:08.375
Just the right blend of sun-roasted beans
and a few mulled spices.

10:08.458 --> 10:10.500
Brewed with love, of course.

10:10.583 --> 10:13.500
Well, it is a revelation.
Shame on me for never having tried it.

10:13.583 --> 10:16.083
From now on, there'll be
no more throwing this in your face.

10:16.167 --> 10:18.750
In fact, I don't feel
like torturing you at all.

10:18.833 --> 10:20.708
Does that seem odd to you?

10:20.792 --> 10:24.458
-Is that a trick question?
-Kaos! Are you in there?

10:24.542 --> 10:27.958
Because I... just wanted to tell you

10:28.042 --> 10:31.375
how much I love you, my son.

10:31.458 --> 10:34.417
You know how proud of you I am, don't you?

10:34.500 --> 10:36.208
Is that a trick question?

10:36.292 --> 10:40.208
And such a wonderful
sense of humor, too.

10:41.125 --> 10:44.375
Oh, have a great day, honey.

10:46.208 --> 10:48.750
That was definitely odd.
Am I right?

10:48.833 --> 10:50.583
As you would say, sir.

10:50.667 --> 10:53.333
-Behold.
-I did it, Glummy!

10:53.417 --> 10:55.417
The spell worked.

10:55.500 --> 10:57.708
I am an Adonis.

10:57.792 --> 11:00.000
Finally, I'll be able to woo
the Golden Queen.

11:00.083 --> 11:03.833
I feel like your time
would be better spent pursuing evil, sir.

11:03.917 --> 11:05.208
Ah!

11:05.292 --> 11:07.333
Luckily, Glumshanks, I didn't ask you.

11:11.167 --> 11:15.917
"And that is why I require all of you
to be more on guard than ever."

11:16.000 --> 11:19.250
Hmm, maybe "vigilant."
Maybe "vigilant" instead of "on guard"?

11:19.333 --> 11:22.333
-Uh-huh.
-Yes, "vigilant" sounds more dire.

11:22.417 --> 11:25.583
And the situation is most dire, indeed.

11:25.667 --> 11:27.667
I only hope this speech is not too late.

11:27.750 --> 11:31.125
I'm finding it increasingly difficult
to hold anyone's attention.

11:31.208 --> 11:33.250
And bananas.
Definitely need those.

11:33.917 --> 11:35.792
Hugo, are you even listening?

11:36.333 --> 11:37.333
Hugo?

11:37.417 --> 11:40.625
Oh, hey, Eon, didn't see you there.
Were you saying something?

11:40.708 --> 11:42.958
Yes!
You've been helping me make changes

11:43.042 --> 11:45.917
to the very important speech I'm about to
give on our state of emergency.

11:46.000 --> 11:47.208
Was I?

11:47.292 --> 11:52.375
Huh. I don't know why I'd be doing that.
I'm actually pretty busy right now.

11:53.250 --> 11:58.208
If I've lost Hugo...
I may have lost them all.

11:58.292 --> 12:01.125
I don't want to alarm everyone,

12:01.208 --> 12:04.750
but we have
a serious situation on our--

12:07.292 --> 12:08.292
Hello.

12:09.583 --> 12:12.542
Bad Breath.
Where is everyone else?

12:12.625 --> 12:17.000
I made it clear in my announcement,
I'm about to give a very important speech.

12:17.917 --> 12:19.083
You did?

12:19.167 --> 12:22.875
Well, we thought it was Master Eon
who was going to make a speech.

12:22.958 --> 12:25.708
But then he never showed up,
so everyone else left.

12:25.792 --> 12:28.833
But I figured, hey,
I got the place to myself...

12:28.917 --> 12:30.917
...which rarely happens,

12:31.000 --> 12:34.750
so I should just let it all hang out
for once.

12:34.833 --> 12:36.917
Oh, seriously?
I'm right here.

12:37.000 --> 12:40.458
Anyway, speaking of it all hanging out,
beardless guy...

12:40.542 --> 12:43.625
Ooh, you better run for it.

12:48.292 --> 12:51.042
Ah! No, this is...

12:51.125 --> 12:53.208
...definitely not my special...

12:53.292 --> 12:54.583
...purpose.

12:58.917 --> 13:01.667
Wow, that beardless dude is pretty mopey.

13:01.750 --> 13:03.333
Huh. You think we should help him?

13:03.417 --> 13:08.042
I feel like we're supposed to,
but, for some reason, I don't want to.

13:08.125 --> 13:09.542
Ooh, I got it.

13:09.625 --> 13:12.625
Let's go see
if I'd make a good jack-o'-lantern.

13:16.167 --> 13:19.667
Well, I really think
you'll like the ballad I wrote you.

13:19.750 --> 13:22.625
The bridge is totally inspired.

13:25.042 --> 13:26.667
Oh, honestly, Wolfgang,

13:26.750 --> 13:31.250
your music interests me
a lot less than your fur.

13:31.333 --> 13:34.917
Well, maybe it's time
to forget about that hair guitar

13:35.000 --> 13:38.083
and get ready for a symphony of coiffure.

13:38.167 --> 13:41.417
Hey, you can't just come here
and parade your new hairstyle around

13:41.500 --> 13:43.833
and expect to get anywhere
with my girlfriend.

13:45.292 --> 13:48.667
- Oh.
- Unless you can.

14:02.292 --> 14:04.375
Oh, Kaos.

14:04.458 --> 14:08.458
That was the most magical afternoon
I've ever had.

14:09.292 --> 14:10.292
Indeed.

14:10.375 --> 14:12.667
"Magical" is the only word for it.

14:14.250 --> 14:17.542
It wasn't magical for all of us.

14:20.708 --> 14:22.167
Hey, any of you guys get the feeling

14:22.250 --> 14:24.292
there's something missing around here?

14:24.375 --> 14:26.208
Yeah, a bomb
we could actually use to get certified.

14:26.292 --> 14:28.083
This is all they had at the armory.

14:28.167 --> 14:29.792
I guess there was a run on regular bombs.

14:29.875 --> 14:32.042
Besides, it's not like we're
getting certified yet.

14:32.125 --> 14:35.083
The only one who can do that
is some sort of authority figure.

14:35.167 --> 14:37.375
A person in charge.

14:37.458 --> 14:40.875
Someone whose title is, like,
master or something.

14:40.958 --> 14:42.667
Yeah, well...

14:42.750 --> 14:47.208
something is definitely missing
from the academy.

14:47.292 --> 14:49.083
-How do you mean?
-I don't know.

14:49.167 --> 14:51.375
Nobody else feels like that?

14:51.458 --> 14:53.042
- Not really.
- Negatory.

14:53.125 --> 14:54.375
- Uh-uh.
- Nope.

14:56.542 --> 14:58.417
Perhaps it was hubris to think

14:58.500 --> 15:02.208
that my beard and I
were the cornerstone of this institution.

15:02.292 --> 15:05.250
That the magic of my facial hair
bound us to our cause,

15:05.333 --> 15:08.292
holding the very fabric
of the academy together.

15:08.375 --> 15:12.042
And without it...
I am no longer needed.

15:15.583 --> 15:16.875
I know what we're missing!

15:16.958 --> 15:18.000
Detonators!

15:24.375 --> 15:30.125
Mmm, that meal was to die for.
You've outdone yourself, my darling.

15:30.208 --> 15:32.458
Glumshanks deserves all the credit.

15:32.542 --> 15:35.750
In fact, it feels almost criminal
keeping him here all to ourselves.

15:35.833 --> 15:38.542
Glummy, my good man, uh, troll,

15:38.625 --> 15:41.292
perhaps it's time for you
to finish your doctorate degree

15:41.375 --> 15:43.125
and make a name for yourself.

15:43.208 --> 15:45.375
Sir, I... I don't know what to say.

15:45.458 --> 15:48.250
Say you'll take the rest of the night off
and consider it.

15:48.333 --> 15:49.625
Very good, sir!

15:50.958 --> 15:54.125
My Queen, I've come to a decision.

15:54.208 --> 15:56.167
Kaos!
What are you doing?

15:56.250 --> 16:00.583
Golden Queen, will you take my head,
I mean, hand,

16:00.667 --> 16:04.208
and rule by my side, happily evil after?

16:04.292 --> 16:06.750
Or until we succeed
in destroying the Skylands?

16:06.833 --> 16:08.208
Whichever comes first.

16:08.292 --> 16:10.583
Oh... yes. Yes!

16:10.667 --> 16:15.083
Yes, I'll take your hand,
your head, and this glorious hair.

16:15.167 --> 16:17.083
Did you hear that, Glummy?

16:17.167 --> 16:18.542
She said yes!

16:18.625 --> 16:21.208
She said yes!

16:21.292 --> 16:24.708
Of course she did, sweetie.
You're such a catch.

16:35.958 --> 16:40.625
Okay, maybe being the base
of a pyramid of Skylanders

16:40.708 --> 16:44.292
isn't what my balancing abilities
are meant for.

16:44.375 --> 16:45.875
Hey...

16:45.958 --> 16:48.958
Didn't you used to be somebody
in charge of something?

16:49.042 --> 16:54.208
Something as important as...
Oh, I don't know... the Skylanders?

16:54.292 --> 16:56.625
Not that, but like that.

16:56.708 --> 17:00.000
I was. Though it feels
like a lifetime ago.

17:00.083 --> 17:04.125
Nay... eons ago. Hmm?

17:04.208 --> 17:08.458
I was just teaching
all of you yesterday.

17:08.541 --> 17:09.541
Master Eon?

17:09.625 --> 17:11.500
Nope.
Doesn't ring a bell.

17:11.583 --> 17:14.250
Come on, you guys.
I still have three-quarters of a wind-up

17:14.333 --> 17:16.208
to figure out what's unique about me.

17:19.375 --> 17:22.083
There, there, my woolly friends.

17:24.625 --> 17:26.333
Et tu, sheep?

17:27.166 --> 17:29.417
Et... tu?

17:33.542 --> 17:35.958
All right, I know there's a timer
in here somewhere.

17:36.042 --> 17:38.875
I'll... I'll just hook it up
and we'll let the certification begin.

17:40.208 --> 17:43.042
Uh, you...
you got something... right here.

17:43.958 --> 17:45.792
Maybe Eruptor is right.

17:45.875 --> 17:48.708
Something feels different,
and not just with my beak.

17:48.792 --> 17:50.500
This shouldn't be so difficult.

17:50.583 --> 17:53.292
So, there is something missing.

17:53.375 --> 17:55.625
I feel it, too.
And it's something important.

17:55.708 --> 18:00.542
Something right on the tip of my chin.
Or more like, not on my chin.

18:00.625 --> 18:06.042
Something important enough
to sit in that important-looking chair.

18:07.458 --> 18:10.208
Something more important than me.

18:10.292 --> 18:12.667
Are you sure you don't mind
taking a break from your studies

18:12.750 --> 18:14.083
to make lunch for us, Glummy?

18:14.167 --> 18:16.667
Frankly, sir, I'm enjoying
the chance to cook for you,

18:16.750 --> 18:18.375
instead of being cooked by you.

18:18.458 --> 18:20.208
Ooh, let's stock up on these.

18:23.583 --> 18:27.833
Why don't you whip up one of those...
tartin tartie tartar things.

18:27.917 --> 18:29.542
You know, the tarts.

18:29.625 --> 18:32.417
Ah, tarte tatin, sir.

18:32.500 --> 18:35.125
Right! Those.
What? What's up?

18:35.750 --> 18:38.250
Wayfaring drifter, ten o'clock.

18:39.875 --> 18:43.917
Some kind of... hairless hobo. Ugh.

18:44.000 --> 18:46.583
That's no hobo.

18:47.375 --> 18:48.417
That's...

18:50.000 --> 18:51.042
Eon.

18:51.125 --> 18:52.833
My beard!

18:59.042 --> 19:00.583
Finders, keepers!

19:01.958 --> 19:04.333
You can have that beard
over my broken, battered,

19:04.417 --> 19:06.667
unconscious, though clearly alive, body.

19:09.000 --> 19:10.708
-Unhand the hair!
-Never!

19:12.167 --> 19:13.792
-You don't deserve it.
-Nonsense.

19:13.875 --> 19:15.458
I'm more diabolical.

19:16.333 --> 19:18.375
Well, I'm more stately!

19:22.333 --> 19:23.750
I'm more ambitious!

19:29.208 --> 19:31.083
Well, I'm... taller!

19:37.500 --> 19:39.542
I mean,
who didn't see that coming?

19:39.625 --> 19:41.792
Fine. Take your stupid beard.

19:41.875 --> 19:44.417
I don't need it now that I know
the Golden Queen loves me

19:44.500 --> 19:46.292
for who I am on the inside.

19:47.958 --> 19:50.000
Well, uh...

19:50.083 --> 19:51.750
Uh...
what are you saying?

19:51.833 --> 19:55.000
Just that getting my hands
on that magical beard

19:55.083 --> 19:59.333
is more appealing
if it doesn't come with you attached.

19:59.417 --> 20:02.542
Well, don't just stand there,
you fools, attack!

20:06.000 --> 20:07.125
I know when I'm outnumbered.

20:07.208 --> 20:10.208
And I think my beard and I
have seen enough action for one day.

20:13.042 --> 20:15.542
Come on, troll.
I was promised lunch.

20:18.667 --> 20:20.500
Skylanders, unite!

20:20.583 --> 20:21.833
Eon!

20:21.917 --> 20:23.125
- You're back!
- Yo, yo.

20:23.750 --> 20:24.792
Ah!

20:25.792 --> 20:27.625
Sorry,
I was just keeping it warm...

20:27.708 --> 20:31.500
Holy guacamole!
Look at that magnificent beard!

20:31.583 --> 20:33.208
So, where've you
been keeping yourself, Eon?

20:33.292 --> 20:35.042
Since you obviously
haven't been around here all day.

20:35.125 --> 20:37.792
Well, it's a long story,
but the short version is...

20:39.000 --> 20:41.250
Kaos stole my beard with dark magic,
which made him so happy

20:41.333 --> 20:42.500
he tried to run away
with the Golden Queen

20:42.583 --> 20:45.167
while I became virtually invisible
until I managed to defeat him,

20:45.250 --> 20:47.417
win back my beard, and return it
to its rightful place on my face

20:47.500 --> 20:49.833
where we can all once more
bask in its utter glory.

20:49.917 --> 20:51.792
The end.

20:51.875 --> 20:53.042
Wow!

20:53.125 --> 20:57.500
-I knew it.
-Now, Skylanders, if you don't mind...

20:57.583 --> 21:00.500
my beard and I
have had a pretty grueling day.

21:00.583 --> 21:04.333
Perhaps you can take
your bomb defusing materials outside?

21:04.417 --> 21:05.417
- Later.
- Sure thing.

21:05.500 --> 21:07.458
- Righty-o.
- You are excused.

21:08.875 --> 21:11.250
I know
you're a stickler for authenticity,

21:11.333 --> 21:14.875
but they weren't working
with live explosives inside, were they?

21:14.958 --> 21:17.792
Not... any... more?

21:20.250 --> 21:22.667
There are dark forces afoot, old friend.

21:22.750 --> 21:27.042
I feel we must put even greater
protections in place than usual.
