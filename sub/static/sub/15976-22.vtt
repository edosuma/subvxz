WEBVTT

00:05.005 --> 00:07.740
I will never sell this company.
A buyout is not an option.

00:07.742 --> 00:09.208
You know what "buyout" means?

00:09.210 --> 00:11.310
- They buy us, we're out.
- Okay,

00:11.312 --> 00:13.012
just listen to me. The Hamasaki people...

00:13.014 --> 00:14.480
they promise that nothing's gonna change.

00:14.482 --> 00:16.081
- (scoffs)
- L... They're a very

00:16.082 --> 00:19.018
- ethical corporation.
- Ethical corporation? That's like saying

00:19.020 --> 00:21.553
a pro-choice Republican
or a partial circumcision.

00:21.555 --> 00:22.921
They don't exist.

00:22.923 --> 00:25.124
Sydney, we want to know

00:25.126 --> 00:27.593
- what you think.
- Yeah, let's hear what my daughter has to say.

00:27.595 --> 00:28.760
Okay, um,

00:28.762 --> 00:30.629
well, I... I see both sides of it.

00:30.631 --> 00:32.664
You know, a big corporation
would give us leverage

00:32.665 --> 00:35.067
and... and open certain
doors. But, on the other hand,

00:35.069 --> 00:36.717
I'd be worried about
our creative autonomy...

00:36.718 --> 00:38.494
Okay, you know what, you're
not even an equity partner.

00:38.504 --> 00:41.206
- She doesn't get to vote.
- Yeah, why'd we even ask her?

00:41.208 --> 00:42.407
Simon, do you understand what kind

00:42.409 --> 00:43.709
of money we're talking about?

00:43.711 --> 00:45.510
This is "make your own species" money.

00:45.512 --> 00:47.112
I want one of those tiny giraffes

00:47.114 --> 00:48.613
like the guy has on the commercial.

00:48.615 --> 00:50.515
Well, we all want that,
Gordon, but at what price?

00:50.517 --> 00:52.584
What price, Gordon? All right,
you know what? You give me

00:52.586 --> 00:55.220
- no choice. I'm gonna call a meeting...
- What?

00:55.222 --> 00:56.855
With the board.

00:56.857 --> 00:58.225
- (whistles)
- You monster.

00:58.259 --> 01:00.508
-  That's right.
-Why is Simon so scared of the board?

01:00.727 --> 01:01.960
Because the board's made up of people

01:01.962 --> 01:03.195
who only care about money.

01:03.197 --> 01:04.596
And my mother.

01:22.603 --> 01:24.269
Hey, Allie, Maytag can't make the meeting.

01:24.271 --> 01:25.704
Do you mind canceling my reservation?

01:25.706 --> 01:28.440
- Sure, I'll take care of it.
- Thanks.

01:28.442 --> 01:31.223
Oh, Andrew, guess what? I got
us reservations at Joe Port's.

01:31.228 --> 01:33.745
All you can eat shrimp buffet. Splash.

01:35.648 --> 01:37.849
Did you just... take my reservation?

01:37.851 --> 01:39.784
Is that okay? It's
just, you didn't want it,

01:39.786 --> 01:41.219
so I kind of just swooped in.

01:41.221 --> 01:42.787
(chuckles) Yeah, of course you did.

01:42.789 --> 01:44.823
Are you sure? 'Cause it seems like you...

01:44.825 --> 01:46.124
you're having second thoughts.

01:46.126 --> 01:48.493
I know sometimes I have
something and I think I don't

01:48.495 --> 01:50.862
want it and then once it's gone,
I realize I made a big mistake.

01:50.864 --> 01:52.730
Do you think you're making
a big mistake, Sydney?

01:52.732 --> 01:55.466
Just take him. It. The. Reser...

01:55.468 --> 01:58.603
vation for... Eat. Food.

01:59.705 --> 02:01.873
Simon, your ex-wife is on her way up.

02:01.875 --> 02:03.775
I had a feeling Paige was
here. My body temperature

02:03.777 --> 02:05.843
dropped three degrees. Everyone.

02:05.845 --> 02:07.879
It's on its way up,

02:07.881 --> 02:09.312
so don't make any sudden movements.

02:09.315 --> 02:12.150
Just play dead until it leaves
with half of everything you own.

02:12.152 --> 02:13.985
Hello, hello, hello.

02:13.987 --> 02:17.155
- I got everyone mittens from Greenland.
- Ooh,

02:17.157 --> 02:18.856
your mom seems kind of fun.

02:18.858 --> 02:20.324
Yup, that's the problem.

02:20.326 --> 02:22.460
My therapist refers to
her as the lighthouse.

02:22.462 --> 02:24.228
When her light shines on you, it's great.

02:24.230 --> 02:27.198
And then, when it's off you,
you're just left in the dark

02:27.200 --> 02:29.934
- to crash on the rocks of childhood neuroses.
- Oh.

02:29.936 --> 02:31.802
(clears throat) Mother.

02:31.804 --> 02:35.339
(gasps) Oh, honey, you look

02:35.341 --> 02:37.274
wonderful. Give me a big...

02:37.276 --> 02:40.011
Oh, Zach, no, not the red ones.

02:40.013 --> 02:41.278
You look much better in blue.

02:41.280 --> 02:42.913
- No. Oh.
- What? Paige said.

02:42.915 --> 02:45.282
- Okay.
- (soft chuckle)

02:45.284 --> 02:47.051
- Hello, Simon.
- Paige.

02:47.053 --> 02:50.220
Have you gotten shorter or
have you just lost more hair?

02:50.226 --> 02:52.490
I didn't recognize you with
so much face behind your ears.

02:52.492 --> 02:54.959
- Oh.
- Oh.

02:56.094 --> 02:57.228
Allie Cat.

02:57.230 --> 03:00.364
- Oh. Hi.
- Ah, Mega-tron. Hi.

03:00.366 --> 03:02.603
This is my BFF, Megan.

03:02.614 --> 03:03.667
- The one I told you about.
- Andrew.

03:03.669 --> 03:05.269
- Hi.
- Champion gymnast in high school.

03:05.271 --> 03:07.471
Ooh. She can still put
both legs behind her head.

03:07.473 --> 03:08.806
Three, two, one.

03:08.808 --> 03:11.008
Hi. (chuckling)

03:11.010 --> 03:13.344
I'm... I'm Zachary. I'm
sort of Andrew's BFF.

03:13.346 --> 03:14.812
Although we don't usually put it like that

03:14.814 --> 03:17.781
- because we're adult males.
- And F is a long, long time.

03:17.783 --> 03:18.490
It sure is.

03:18.491 --> 03:20.577
Okay, well, we are gonna go
grab some coffee downstairs.

03:20.653 --> 03:22.920
- It was nice to meet you.
- Yeah.

03:25.590 --> 03:28.392
Did you see that? With the
laughing and the touching

03:28.394 --> 03:30.961
- on the arm?
- Yeah, Fonzie, she totally wants it.

03:30.963 --> 03:33.163
Yeah. Maybe she was just being polite.

03:33.165 --> 03:34.087
Do you ever consider that?

03:34.088 --> 03:35.717
- I mean, she's Allie's best friend...
- (phone dings)

03:35.768 --> 03:38.502
she probably... she probably
feels an obligation to...

03:38.504 --> 03:41.705
- No, she wants to be fixed up with you.
- Nice. Okay, let's craft a reply.

03:41.707 --> 03:42.839
Something that says I'm interested but

03:42.841 --> 03:43.974
not jumping out of my seat.

03:43.976 --> 03:46.910
- "He... says... no." Send.
- (whoosh)

03:46.912 --> 03:49.179
Uh, that was maybe a
little too standoffish,

03:49.181 --> 03:52.249
- 'cause...
- Look, I love you like a brother but you are a dog.

03:52.251 --> 03:54.217
And I think that's great.
But Megan and Allie...

03:54.219 --> 03:55.318
they... they're best friends.

03:55.320 --> 03:57.356
This could only end up
biting me in the ass.

03:57.358 --> 04:00.223
Hey, listen, I can be a good guy.

04:00.225 --> 04:03.827
I promise. I will be a perfect gentleman.

04:05.530 --> 04:08.031
(slowly exhales) All right.
I'm gonna so regret this.

04:08.033 --> 04:10.834
Yes. Andrew, you are my BF. Possibly for F.

04:10.836 --> 04:13.203
It's important that you B in me.

04:13.205 --> 04:16.973
"B" is believe. I meant believe.

04:16.975 --> 04:20.176
Let's not ask ourselves what we
gain when we sell the company.

04:20.204 --> 04:22.872
Let's ask ourselves what we lose.

04:22.874 --> 04:24.774
I believe we lose our freedom.

04:24.776 --> 04:27.510
As Braveheart said to us
in blue face and a mullet,

04:27.512 --> 04:29.211
(Scottish accent): "We
must tell our enemies"

04:29.213 --> 04:31.647
they may take our lives...

04:31.649 --> 04:34.817
but they'll never take our freedom."

04:34.819 --> 04:37.186
And I believed him, but that
was before the anti-Semitic rants

04:37.188 --> 04:38.888
and trying to kill his
mail-order bride. (chuckles)

04:38.890 --> 04:41.924
I'd like to leave you with
the words of Albert Camus.

04:41.926 --> 04:45.494
"Without freedom, there is no art."

04:47.530 --> 04:49.331
(whispers): Okay.

04:50.533 --> 04:52.735
(clears throat)

04:57.140 --> 05:00.542
$47 million.

05:03.513 --> 05:04.580
How did the vote go?

05:04.582 --> 05:06.215
It was a tie.

05:06.217 --> 05:08.550
What... how is that possible?
There are nine board members.

05:08.552 --> 05:10.652
Mm, I guess I'm the
deciding vote. (short laugh)

05:10.654 --> 05:13.222
And you know how much I hate
being the center of attention.

05:13.224 --> 05:15.691
So, what are you gonna do?
You gonna side with the man who

05:15.693 --> 05:18.627
stole your youth or go with
the non-threatening gay guy

05:18.629 --> 05:20.262
who always tells you how young you look?

05:20.264 --> 05:21.997
Mom, you have to leave
personal stuff out...

05:21.999 --> 05:24.066
I'm saying this to the woman
that fought for the beach house

05:24.068 --> 05:25.867
in the divorce and then
sold it for a dollar

05:25.869 --> 05:26.902
just to piss my dad off.

05:26.904 --> 05:28.670
- What?
- Did I never tell you that?

05:28.672 --> 05:29.805
Kind of defeats the purpose.

05:29.807 --> 05:32.007
Well, I can imagine your pain.

05:37.570 --> 05:39.938
You're as hairy as a lowland gorilla.

05:39.940 --> 05:42.424
Heredity's not been kind
to me. I can't dispute that.

05:42.439 --> 05:43.942
You're an average driver. At best.

05:43.944 --> 05:45.377
- Lauren, please. I know you're...
- Yeah.

05:45.379 --> 05:46.912
trying to help, but you need to hit harder.

05:46.914 --> 05:48.513
I need to become immune to Paige's attacks.

05:48.515 --> 05:50.749
- But I feel terrible.
- I know this pains you.

05:50.751 --> 05:52.784
But I need you to hit me with the worst.

05:52.786 --> 05:54.019
Break out...

05:54.021 --> 05:55.454
the nuclear option.

05:59.092 --> 06:01.727
"Simon Roberts.

06:01.729 --> 06:03.495
You left Sydney at the mall.

06:03.497 --> 06:05.797
- You know it's not true. Uh-huh.
- "She had to sit there alone at

06:05.799 --> 06:08.033
Spencer's Gifts next
to the dancing cactus.

06:08.035 --> 06:10.101
Every time she cried, it
would just dance harder."

06:10.103 --> 06:14.239
"* You live at the mall
now, you live at the... *"

06:14.241 --> 06:15.707
I have never left Sydney at the mall.

06:15.709 --> 06:18.543
You did. That's why you'll never admit

06:18.545 --> 06:20.212
that the hairy alcoholic in this family

06:20.214 --> 06:21.980
is the more responsible parent.

06:21.982 --> 06:24.282
- Okay. Maybe we just...
- Yeah. Let's try that again.

06:24.284 --> 06:25.984
- Go through that again. Okay?
- Yeah. Okay. Yeah.

06:25.986 --> 06:27.886
- Don't do the mall thing again, I mean, don't do the...
- Okay.

06:27.888 --> 06:30.955
I was thinking I should
take you away this weekend.

06:30.957 --> 06:32.590
We could spend a fortune on fancy clothes,

06:32.592 --> 06:36.528
go to Vegas, return everything on Monday.

06:36.530 --> 06:38.329
Come on, it'll be fun, I promise.

06:38.331 --> 06:40.331
Yeah, I... I don't know.
I mean, you say that,

06:40.398 --> 06:42.699
and then somehow you wind up
in Tangiers with your trainer

06:42.701 --> 06:44.968
and I'm left standing on a
street corner waiting for you

06:44.970 --> 06:47.170
- in a bandage dress and hooker boots, and that...
- Yeah,

06:47.172 --> 06:49.472
I get it. We've had some miscommunications.

06:49.474 --> 06:50.907
(short laugh)

06:52.009 --> 06:54.510
All right. It's none of my business,

06:54.512 --> 06:55.878
but, um...

06:55.880 --> 06:57.847
can I tell you the most
important thing I've learned

06:57.849 --> 06:59.849
in my 29 years on this planet?

06:59.851 --> 07:02.919
You only regret the things you didn't do.

07:02.921 --> 07:05.088
Are you telling me you
actually regret something?

07:05.090 --> 07:07.490
Not spending more time with
you when I had the chance.

07:07.492 --> 07:11.027
And saying no to a romantic
evening with Loni Anderson.

07:11.029 --> 07:12.295
(chuckles)

07:12.297 --> 07:13.696
Or was it Louie Anderson?

07:13.698 --> 07:16.399
Well, either way it would
have been a fine story.

07:16.401 --> 07:19.569
Let's talk about it more
over a cup of scotch.

07:19.571 --> 07:22.038
- Come on.
- Don't you mean coffee?

07:22.040 --> 07:24.440
- No.
- (chuckles)

07:24.442 --> 07:28.811
And this is me doing
the splits at nationals.

07:28.813 --> 07:30.146
The trick is to...

07:30.148 --> 07:33.215
- completely relax your pelvic bone.
- Mmm.

07:33.217 --> 07:35.484
You know, I could show
you later if you want.

07:35.486 --> 07:38.521
Sports... are so great.

07:38.523 --> 07:40.756
It's just... good clean fun.

07:40.758 --> 07:43.559
- (chuckles) You need to relax.
- (chuckles)

07:43.561 --> 07:44.894
You know what you need?

07:44.896 --> 07:45.828
Hmm?

07:45.830 --> 07:47.196
You need to...

07:47.198 --> 07:50.666
(whispering indistinctly)

07:50.668 --> 07:51.867
I...

07:51.869 --> 07:53.569
have butter.

07:53.571 --> 07:55.204
I'm gonna get you a refill.

07:55.206 --> 07:56.405
- Okay.
- Andrew,

07:56.407 --> 07:57.973
can I talk to you for a second?

07:57.975 --> 08:00.643
- Let me top you up.
- Okay.

08:02.045 --> 08:03.412
(quietly): This girl is crazy.

08:03.414 --> 08:05.848
She told me that she wants
to go home with me and... and

08:05.850 --> 08:07.750
- do things.
- This is unbelievable.

08:07.752 --> 08:10.177
You made me a promise. Tonight's
about being a gentleman.

08:10.178 --> 08:11.887
I know. That's why I brought you over here

08:11.889 --> 08:14.556
because I need your strength.
I need you to talk me down

08:14.558 --> 08:16.959
because, listen... listen to me,
this is what she wants to do.

08:16.961 --> 08:18.627
Come here. She wants to...

08:18.629 --> 08:20.829
(whispering indistinctly)

08:21.698 --> 08:23.165
No, you have to do that.

08:23.167 --> 08:25.834
But afterwards, you are a gentleman, okay?

08:25.836 --> 08:28.437
You sleep over. She wants to
have brunch, you have brunch.

08:28.439 --> 08:30.939
She wants to go to a museum,
you go to the museum, okay?

08:30.941 --> 08:33.674
There's a lot riding on this.
This is not just about you.

08:33.677 --> 08:35.644
Hey. N... no, this is not... this is...

08:35.645 --> 08:38.746
I'm gonna be thinking
about you the entire time.

08:42.886 --> 08:45.922
I hope you're in the mood
for my chicken parmigiana.

08:45.924 --> 08:48.291
(chuckles) Sounds delicious.

08:48.293 --> 08:50.093
Speaking of Italians,

08:50.095 --> 08:53.029
remember how hard I had to
fight you for that Maserati?

08:53.031 --> 08:55.498
- The one you parked in Lake Michigan?
- (chuckles) Yeah.

08:55.500 --> 08:56.366
I'm fun.

08:56.368 --> 08:58.935
Big... fun. (chuckles)

08:59.937 --> 09:01.037
New necklace?

09:01.039 --> 09:03.506
- Yeah, Gordon gave it to me.
- Really?

09:03.508 --> 09:05.341
How randomly generous of him.

09:05.343 --> 09:07.343
This place is so adorable.

09:07.345 --> 09:09.179
- Oh, thanks.
- See?

09:09.181 --> 09:10.613
Aren't you glad I got the big house

09:10.615 --> 09:12.215
on the North Shore in the divorce?

09:12.217 --> 09:14.771
- Oh, yeah.
- I mean, this place is so much easier to manage.

09:14.778 --> 09:16.886
I should've thanked you for that years ago.

09:16.888 --> 09:19.522
- Oh, you were so much angrier then.
- (chuckling): Yeah.

09:19.524 --> 09:21.291
Remember you always used to make that face.

09:21.293 --> 09:22.225
What face?

09:22.227 --> 09:23.026
That face.

09:23.028 --> 09:24.293
Ha-ha!

09:24.295 --> 09:25.328
Remember how mad you'd get

09:25.330 --> 09:27.063
every time I mentioned that terrible day

09:27.065 --> 09:28.431
you left Sydney in the mall?

09:28.433 --> 09:31.034
Who likes to be reminded of
their own negligence, you know?

09:31.036 --> 09:35.138
- (blender whirring loudly)
- (muttering indistinctly)

09:35.140 --> 09:36.372
Gazpacho?

09:36.374 --> 09:37.440
No, I hate your soup.

09:37.442 --> 09:39.008
- Oh.
- You know, I really love

09:39.010 --> 09:40.076
the new Simon.

09:40.078 --> 09:42.345
- Thanks.
- Finally taking responsibility.

09:42.347 --> 09:45.381
Can I let you in on a
little secret about the vote?

09:45.383 --> 09:46.215
Please do.

09:46.217 --> 09:48.517
I'm leaning your way.

09:49.920 --> 09:51.287
(panting)

09:51.289 --> 09:52.955
That was incredible.

09:52.957 --> 09:56.926
That was like having a front row
seat at a gymnastics tournament.

09:56.928 --> 09:58.928
So, um...

09:58.930 --> 10:01.097
what do you want to do now?

10:01.099 --> 10:03.299
I'm, uh, open to cuddling.

10:03.301 --> 10:06.635
- (laughs)
- (chuckles)

10:08.071 --> 10:10.372
<i>ZACH: Yeah, that's right.
I offered to cuddle.</i>

10:10.374 --> 10:13.442
<i>I wish Andrew could see this.</i>

10:13.444 --> 10:15.211
I'm really proud of you, bud.

10:15.213 --> 10:16.845
Thanks, man.

10:16.847 --> 10:18.981
- Why am I dressed like Ebenezer Scrooge?
- You know,

10:18.983 --> 10:21.317
I don't know. I guess I just
figured that's how you slept.

10:21.319 --> 10:22.484
(chuckles) That's funny.

10:22.486 --> 10:23.686
- Hey.
- Hey.

10:23.688 --> 10:25.154
Do you want to go to a wedding?

10:25.156 --> 10:26.689
- Excuse me?
- (chuckles)

10:26.691 --> 10:28.123
- Wouldn't that be freakin' nuts?
- I mean,

10:28.125 --> 10:31.560
maybe it's the alcohol talking
but I kind of want you to come.

10:31.562 --> 10:33.262
Huh.

10:33.264 --> 10:34.630
Okay.

10:34.632 --> 10:36.398
That's big, right?

10:36.400 --> 10:38.167
<i>(ghostlike): Huge.</i>

10:39.869 --> 10:41.904
(chuckles) A little over the top.

10:41.906 --> 10:43.439
Just the outfit. I got inspi...

10:43.441 --> 10:45.674
But, no, weddings, that's boyfriend stuff.

10:45.676 --> 10:47.576
It's too much, it's too soon.

10:47.578 --> 10:49.912
Not for Zach OS 7.

10:49.914 --> 10:51.914
Not for New Age Zach.

10:51.916 --> 10:55.517
Old Zach, he would've run
from this apartment really far.

10:55.519 --> 10:57.819
He would've waited two weeks and maybe
he would've Facebooked her roommate.

10:57.821 --> 11:00.622
Zach OS 7, he stays.

11:00.624 --> 11:02.858
He stays.

11:02.860 --> 11:05.027
I will go to this wedding.

11:05.029 --> 11:07.896
And I will not Facebook your roommate.

11:08.731 --> 11:10.766
Thank you.

11:17.127 --> 11:19.696
You don't think Allie's
high-waisted, do you?

11:19.698 --> 11:21.230
- Why?
- Well, your mom was just telling me

11:21.232 --> 11:22.999
how happy she was about my relationship,

11:23.001 --> 11:25.201
and then she offhandedly
mentioned that Allie's waist

11:25.203 --> 11:27.470
seemed like it was right below her armpits.

11:27.472 --> 11:30.339
And, uh, now I can't get
that image out of my mind.

11:30.341 --> 11:32.909
Well, I... long legs
are a good thing, right?

11:32.911 --> 11:36.612
Oh. Yeah. That's what I thought.

11:36.614 --> 11:38.414
Oh,

11:38.416 --> 11:39.315
you're in a good mood.

11:39.317 --> 11:40.550
- I am.
- Mmm.

11:40.552 --> 11:41.884
It's been nice having Mom around.

11:41.886 --> 11:43.452
I forgot how much fun she can be.

11:43.454 --> 11:44.687
Yeah. Did I tell you we went

11:44.689 --> 11:46.122
to an open house that
she was interested in?

11:46.124 --> 11:47.423
Did she go through the medicine cabinets?

11:47.425 --> 11:48.991
Yeah. But then afterwards she talked

11:48.993 --> 11:51.193
about maybe setting up
a home base in Chicago.

11:51.195 --> 11:52.995
Well, you know your mother...
everything's a fun idea,

11:52.997 --> 11:54.397
but I wouldn't read too much into it.

11:54.399 --> 11:56.465
- Dad, people can change. You know that.
- I know.

11:56.467 --> 11:58.401
Come on. Say one nice thing about her.

11:58.403 --> 12:00.069
She's leaning my way on the vote.

12:00.071 --> 12:01.704
(whistling)

12:01.706 --> 12:03.506
(Gordon whistling)

12:03.508 --> 12:04.707
Wait.

12:05.408 --> 12:06.742
Why are you whistling?

12:07.777 --> 12:10.479
This is the "Divas in
Terrible Movies" marathon.

12:10.481 --> 12:13.048
<i>- Now, we have Mahogany, Glitter...
- Oh.</i>

12:13.050 --> 12:14.783
<i>- Burlesque...
- Ooh.</i>

12:14.785 --> 12:17.853
<i>And we're gonna start
with Another Stakeout.</i>

12:17.855 --> 12:19.722
Who's the diva in that?

12:19.724 --> 12:21.223
- (opening music playing)
- Richard Dreyfuss.

12:21.225 --> 12:23.592
(chuckles) This is fun.

12:23.594 --> 12:25.894
- It is. Easy.
- (sighs)

12:25.896 --> 12:27.930
And about the vote,

12:27.932 --> 12:30.165
I'm leaning your way.

12:30.167 --> 12:31.633
She said she was leaning
my way on the vote.

12:31.635 --> 12:32.935
She's playing us both.

12:32.937 --> 12:33.969
That's ridiculous. She said she
was leaning my way on the vote.

12:33.971 --> 12:35.561
What happened to sisters sticking together?

12:35.873 --> 12:39.054
Was the whole message of
burlesque totally lost on her?

12:39.116 --> 12:41.470
Let's take the high road. Enough
prostituting our principles.

12:41.471 --> 12:42.471
Good.

12:43.180 --> 12:44.431
I guess you owe me a vote.

12:44.432 --> 12:46.280
You just wanna leave it on th nightstand?

12:46.293 --> 12:48.850
Oh, come on. We both wanted this to happen.

12:48.852 --> 12:49.750
Mmm.

12:49.951 --> 12:51.608
When was the last time we did this?

12:52.022 --> 12:53.388
When you wanted the beach house.

12:53.390 --> 12:54.556
(both panting)

12:54.558 --> 12:56.291
God, I love that beach house.

12:56.293 --> 12:57.926
When's the last time we did this?

12:57.928 --> 13:00.462
When you wanted me to vote for Clinton.

13:00.464 --> 13:02.998
God, she's gonna make a great president.

13:03.000 --> 13:05.734
Ooh. When was the last time we did this?

13:05.736 --> 13:07.736
When you wanted me to vote for Clinton.

13:07.738 --> 13:09.337
Oh.

13:09.339 --> 13:13.008
Oh, God, that man can play the sax.

13:13.010 --> 13:15.610
Oh, we got to stop doing this.

13:15.612 --> 13:17.779
What is it about hate
sex that's so appealing?

13:17.781 --> 13:19.181
Is there any other kind?

13:19.183 --> 13:20.615
- I'm guessing this is yours.
- Mmm.

13:20.617 --> 13:22.498
<i>Morocco on $4,000 a Day.</i>

13:22.657 --> 13:25.020
Carol called with this crazy idea.

13:25.022 --> 13:27.055
We're gonna do a year abroad.

13:27.057 --> 13:28.823
Does Sydney know? Because
she mentioned something

13:28.825 --> 13:30.458
about an open house and you and she...

13:30.460 --> 13:33.595
Oh, no, no, no. She and I
were just having fun. Besides,

13:33.597 --> 13:35.764
their medicine cabinet was an abortion.

13:35.766 --> 13:38.466
Nothing but Q-tips and
two-year-old Benadryl.

13:38.468 --> 13:39.601
But you're gonna tell her, right, Paige?

13:39.603 --> 13:41.803
About, um, the year abroad and...

13:41.805 --> 13:44.239
You don't have to tell me
that. She's my daughter.

13:44.241 --> 13:45.640
You're right. Of course.

13:45.642 --> 13:47.208
(knocking)

13:49.245 --> 13:50.812
What the hell are you here to do?

13:50.814 --> 13:53.014
The bare minimum.

13:53.883 --> 13:57.051
(Pachelbel's "Canon in D" playing)

13:59.188 --> 14:01.155
(exhales)

14:01.157 --> 14:03.576
You might want to come in,
the wedding's about to start.

14:03.578 --> 14:05.960
Oh, I'm just waiting on someone.
They should be here in a minute.

14:08.931 --> 14:10.665
- Megan?
- Oh, my God. Zach.

14:10.667 --> 14:13.334
Did I invite you to my wedding?

14:13.336 --> 14:15.770
An invite to the wedding was communicated.

14:15.772 --> 14:17.405
Some other important details

14:17.407 --> 14:19.173
fell through the cracks.

14:21.210 --> 14:22.810
It was her wedding?

14:22.812 --> 14:25.713
- Kind of an important detail.
- What... what was she thinking?

14:25.715 --> 14:28.115
I don't know. Why don't you
ask your girlfriend here?

14:28.117 --> 14:30.718
- What are you implying?
- That she served me up to her friend

14:30.720 --> 14:32.787
the week of her wedding.
Like I was a piece of meat

14:32.789 --> 14:35.289
to be chewed up and digested
and released through the skin

14:35.291 --> 14:38.359
in a pleasant smelling vapor.
In my world, girls don't poop.

14:38.361 --> 14:40.094
That is the stupidest
thing I've ever heard.

14:40.096 --> 14:41.195
Why would she do that?

14:41.197 --> 14:43.097
Because Megan was looking

14:43.099 --> 14:44.565
for some meaningless fun before the big day

14:44.567 --> 14:46.867
and I thought Zach would be
the perfect guy to do that with.

14:46.869 --> 14:48.769
- Unbelievable.
- Allie.

14:48.771 --> 14:51.172
Come on, Andrew, you're
always saying what a dog he is.

14:51.174 --> 14:53.908
- Dude, that is so not cool.
- Okay, in fairness, I say that to your face

14:53.910 --> 14:56.143
- all the time.
- Yeah, but telling her breaks the bro code,

14:56.145 --> 14:57.411
if that's even still a thing.

14:57.413 --> 14:58.612
Okay, you're right. Dude, I... I'm sorry.

14:58.614 --> 15:00.881
And I am saying "dude"
because I want you to know

15:00.883 --> 15:01.982
how serious I am.

15:01.984 --> 15:03.384
But, A... Allie, look,

15:03.386 --> 15:04.652
the other night I saw a man

15:04.654 --> 15:06.153
trying to make a real connection.

15:06.155 --> 15:08.389
- I did feel good about it.
- Yeah, you should feel good about it.

15:08.391 --> 15:10.791
I mean, he may not be there yet, but

15:10.793 --> 15:12.693
this guy... he's a keeper.

15:12.695 --> 15:14.266
Whoa, but not, like, around
the corner, right? I mean,

15:14.267 --> 15:15.609
- I still got some time.
- For sure. I mean,

15:15.611 --> 15:17.703
she's probably not even born yet.
Maybe she's just learning to read,

15:17.705 --> 15:19.410
but somewhere out
there is a girl who's waiting

15:19.412 --> 15:20.708
to grow up and become your somewhat

15:20.710 --> 15:22.287
inappropriately youthful soul mate.

15:22.371 --> 15:23.704
And you're gonna make her really happy,

15:23.706 --> 15:25.139
man, because you're my BFF.

15:25.141 --> 15:26.273
(soft laugh)

15:26.275 --> 15:28.375
I B in you.

15:28.377 --> 15:31.779
"B" as in believe.

15:31.781 --> 15:33.514
Yeah.

15:33.516 --> 15:35.649
I'm gonna walk away.

15:37.752 --> 15:41.088
Hey, do you think Allie's
got a sort of high waist?

15:41.090 --> 15:42.289
No.

15:42.291 --> 15:44.124
Right.

15:44.126 --> 15:46.327
Well, maybe.

15:49.297 --> 15:50.664
<i>Well, Simon, looks like the vote's</i>

15:50.666 --> 15:53.467
gonna go your way. Congrats.

15:53.619 --> 15:55.585
Finally, the white straight guy wins.

15:55.587 --> 15:57.120
You guys get all the
good wedding planner jobs,

15:57.122 --> 15:58.335
so it all evens out.

15:58.424 --> 16:00.757
Timothy and I could've had
the yacht of our dreams,

16:00.759 --> 16:02.792
<i>the SS I'm A Miranda.</i>

16:02.794 --> 16:04.060
Whoa.

16:05.129 --> 16:07.997
Hey. How's my favorite lady?

16:07.999 --> 16:09.899
Oh, please, you already have my vote.

16:09.901 --> 16:11.267
Keep some dignity.

16:11.269 --> 16:13.469
Please. My dignity flew out
the window along with my pants

16:13.471 --> 16:14.637
around 9:00 p.m. last night.

16:14.639 --> 16:15.938
- (laughs)
- Hey, Mom, guess what?

16:15.940 --> 16:17.440
Remember the sweet old
lady on the third floor?

16:17.442 --> 16:19.275
- The one that fed all the neighborhood cats?
- Yeah.

16:19.277 --> 16:22.078
She's dead. They found the last
ten percent of her body yesterday.

16:22.080 --> 16:23.546
Sydney, I know she used
to take your newspaper,

16:23.548 --> 16:24.881
but she's still a human being.

16:24.883 --> 16:26.883
Oh, yeah, no, that's
totally sad and tragic, but

16:26.885 --> 16:28.584
the apartment's available for Mom.

16:28.586 --> 16:30.987
I mean, I know it might be a little
strange, being right downstairs, but

16:30.989 --> 16:33.256
I mean, come on, we could have
coffee in the morning, we could

16:33.258 --> 16:35.491
share critical looks over short
skirts and loser boyfriends.

16:35.493 --> 16:37.126
- I promise I won't be too judgy.
- (laughs)

16:37.128 --> 16:38.728
Yeah, that sounds like fun, but, uh,

16:38.730 --> 16:40.096
let's talk about it later, okay?

16:40.098 --> 16:41.764
- You didn't tell her, did you?
- Tell me what?

16:41.766 --> 16:43.432
Really? We're gonna do this now?

16:43.434 --> 16:44.734
I don't understand. What's going on?

16:44.736 --> 16:46.402
Nothing. (short laugh)
Why do you have to make

16:46.404 --> 16:48.504
- everything such a scene?
- Uh, I should probably wait five minutes

16:48.506 --> 16:50.506
to do this, but that's five
minutes more of my daughter

16:50.508 --> 16:52.708
getting her hopes up for nothing.

16:52.710 --> 16:57.179
Sydney, your mother's
going to Morocco for a year.

16:57.181 --> 16:59.014
She's not taking that apartment.

16:59.016 --> 17:00.382
Oh.

17:00.384 --> 17:02.051
(sighs) Perfect.

17:02.053 --> 17:04.787
- Once again, you're the hero, I'm the villain.
- You always do this.

17:04.789 --> 17:06.622
You always make these
promises and you never

17:06.624 --> 17:08.490
follow through. I'm just
trying to protect her.

17:08.492 --> 17:10.092
- Protect her from me? Really?
- Yeah.

17:10.094 --> 17:12.027
Who protected her when you
abandoned her in the mall?

17:12.029 --> 17:13.929
I never abandoned her at
the mall. I may have left her

17:13.931 --> 17:15.830
at Chuck E. Cheese, I left
her at countless coat checks,

17:15.833 --> 17:17.199
I may have once shipped her to Phoenix

17:17.201 --> 17:19.367
in a dog crate, but I
never left her at the mall.

17:19.369 --> 17:20.569
Wait, that dog crate
thing actually happened?

17:20.570 --> 17:21.936
- It wasn't a dream?
- You know, the difference

17:21.939 --> 17:23.271
between you and I?

17:23.273 --> 17:24.640
I've admitted my mistakes and I've spent

17:24.642 --> 17:26.375
the last ten years making up for them.

17:26.377 --> 17:28.242
Guys, this is ridiculous,
okay? I mean, it's...

17:28.244 --> 17:31.346
a stupid apartment. It's
not even worth fighting over.

17:31.348 --> 17:33.048
(Paige sighs)

17:35.618 --> 17:37.119
I hope you're happy.

17:37.121 --> 17:40.222
I'm never happy when my girl's hurting.

17:42.725 --> 17:44.626
Kind of rough, huh?

17:44.628 --> 17:47.729
It's a shame it'll be so
fresh when we vote now.

17:53.002 --> 17:54.569
I'm don't know what's upsetting me more:

17:54.571 --> 17:56.938
the buyout or seeing
Gordon in yacht slacks.

17:56.940 --> 17:59.608
Those things show everything.

17:59.610 --> 18:02.043
What about you, kiddo? You okay?

18:02.045 --> 18:04.412
I get sucked in every time

18:04.414 --> 18:07.516
and then I end up crashing on the rocks.

18:07.518 --> 18:09.084
Does she even care at all?

18:09.086 --> 18:11.019
Course she cares. When
your mom's there with you,

18:11.021 --> 18:13.555
she's there 100%.

18:13.557 --> 18:15.090
What'd she say about Andrew?

18:15.092 --> 18:17.425
- How do you know we talked about Andrew?
- Well,

18:17.427 --> 18:19.294
I'm kind of keyed in to your personal life.

18:20.396 --> 18:22.330
And I may have peeked
in your Dropbox folder.

18:22.332 --> 18:23.665
- Dad.
- Honey,

18:23.667 --> 18:24.866
don't have a file called "Diary"

18:24.868 --> 18:27.302
if your password is 12345678.

18:28.471 --> 18:29.637
What'd she say?

18:29.639 --> 18:32.373
- That I would regret the things I don't do.
- Mm.

18:32.375 --> 18:33.754
Why didn't you ask me what I think?

18:34.111 --> 18:36.744
Because I was afraid you
would say the same thing.

18:36.746 --> 18:39.814
But coming from you, it
wouldn't sound as crazy.

18:39.816 --> 18:41.549
Oh, you poor kid.

18:41.551 --> 18:43.585
I think that growing
up with two parents who

18:43.587 --> 18:45.053
jump out of moving cars mid-fight,

18:45.055 --> 18:46.321
you learn to strap in.

18:46.323 --> 18:47.822
You know, despite all of our faults,

18:47.824 --> 18:50.325
I wish that for just once
in a while you had a dash

18:50.327 --> 18:52.126

never talk about it again.

Hey, Cindy, congratulations,
we're not doing the buyout.

19:46.198 --> 19:47.697
You won.

19:47.699 --> 19:49.365
I won. How?

19:49.367 --> 19:51.734
Sometimes I do the right thing.

19:51.736 --> 19:52.936
Now, if you'll excuse me,

19:52.938 --> 19:55.672
I have to go burn a doll
made out of your hair.

19:57.141 --> 19:59.475
- (laughing): Ow!
- Sorry.

19:59.477 --> 20:01.477
Thank you, Paige.

20:01.479 --> 20:04.881
I think the reason I make
so many promises to Sydney

20:04.883 --> 20:07.050
is I want her to like me
as much as she likes you.

20:07.052 --> 20:08.050
She loves you.

20:08.052 --> 20:09.619
She just needs you to follow through.

20:09.621 --> 20:11.254
You're right.

20:11.256 --> 20:13.055
I'm moving back. I'm taking that condo.

20:13.057 --> 20:15.224
Nah, just return an e-mail or two.

20:15.226 --> 20:17.493
- Oh, God, that's too much.
- (laughs)

20:17.495 --> 20:19.195
So, where is she? Where is our Sydney?

20:19.197 --> 20:21.230
Because I am taking us
all out to dinner tonight.

20:21.232 --> 20:22.632
She's in her office right now with Andrew.

20:22.634 --> 20:23.900
She took my advice?

20:23.902 --> 20:25.234
Well, I put it in terms
she could understand.

20:25.236 --> 20:26.569
So it's sort of my advice.

20:26.571 --> 20:28.371
Oh, come on, you won't even
give me that one small victory?

20:28.373 --> 20:29.939
It wouldn't be a victory
if I hadn't stepped in.

20:29.941 --> 20:32.174
- Oh, you are... What'd he say?
- How'd it go?

20:32.176 --> 20:34.210
What's the weather like
this time of year in Morocco?

20:34.212 --> 20:35.511
Oh, it doesn't matter.
I'll just pack anything

20:35.513 --> 20:37.546
- that matches sand.
- (Simon speaks indistinctly)

20:37.548 --> 20:40.149
- Come on.
- Can you take Mr. Princess for a year?

20:40.151 --> 20:41.650
And I'm not the one who left
her at the mall. You are.

20:41.652 --> 20:43.853
I'm telling you. I
distinctly remember that day.

20:43.855 --> 20:45.621
It was March 2, 1987.

20:47.825 --> 20:49.325
B mark.

20:49.327 --> 20:50.326
I think that is great.

20:50.328 --> 20:53.128
In na-normal wah...

20:53.130 --> 20:54.597
(both laugh)

20:54.599 --> 20:55.564
(grunts)

20:55.566 --> 20:58.300
(blender whirring) Wow!

20:59.603 --> 21:01.837
(laughing): Thanks, man.
