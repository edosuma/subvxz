(all laughing uncontrollably)

00:36.822 --> 00:38.354
Attention, everyone.

00:38.474 --> 00:40.522
As you all know,
there has been an alien

00:40.642 --> 00:42.374
on the loose for quite some time now.

00:42.494 --> 00:44.143
I've checked my house.
He's not in my house.

00:44.263 --> 00:45.632
Good work, Smith.

00:45.792 --> 00:48.130
Still, the search could use
a little boost.

00:48.250 --> 00:51.383
Everyone, meet freelance
alien bounty hunter,

00:51.503 --> 00:52.968
Shannon Sharpe.

00:53.088 --> 00:54.303
Glad to be aboard.

00:54.423 --> 00:56.017
Shannon Sharpe?
The football guy?

00:56.177 --> 00:57.973
Yeah. I hunt aliens now.

00:58.093 --> 01:00.647
Used to catch TDs; now I catch ETs.

01:00.896 --> 01:02.315
You ever caught an alien, Shannon?

01:02.531 --> 01:03.679
Not yet, Mr. Question,

01:03.799 --> 01:05.547
but I'll let you know when I do.

01:05.667 --> 01:07.199
Anyone with any helpful information

01:07.319 --> 01:09.969
should report it to
Shannon Sharpe immediately.

01:10.089 --> 01:12.534
Let's bring in this damn alien
once and for all.

01:12.694 --> 01:14.173
Yes! Let's bring it in!

01:14.293 --> 01:15.974
I want to bring it in so bad!

01:16.094 --> 01:18.978
(grunting)

01:19.098 --> 01:21.447
You are a complicated man, Smith.

01:21.567 --> 01:24.254
I would love to do
mushrooms with you.

01:26.958 --> 01:29.175
(horn honking)

01:29.335 --> 01:30.885
Oh, no! I overslept!

01:32.088 --> 01:34.013
Oh, no! I'm out of undies!

01:35.214 --> 01:37.142
Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no.
Oh, no. Oh, no.

01:41.556 --> 01:42.584
(sighs)

01:42.704 --> 01:44.036
Thanks for holding the bus, Judy.

01:44.156 --> 01:46.021
(yelling)

01:46.141 --> 01:47.839
(sighs) I overslept.

01:47.959 --> 01:50.321
I didn't even get to study
for my test today.

01:51.814 --> 01:53.896
Steve, what the hell are you wearing?

01:54.016 --> 01:56.682
Ah, man. I must have grabbed a pair

01:56.802 --> 01:58.400
of Hayley's underwear from the dryer.

01:58.520 --> 02:00.069
This day can't get any worse!

02:00.189 --> 02:01.704
Those are Hayley's?

02:01.824 --> 02:03.188
Let me smell them.

02:03.308 --> 02:04.657
Snot, we're on the bus.

02:04.777 --> 02:06.659
I'm not going to take them off.

02:06.779 --> 02:08.631
That's not what I asked.

02:10.293 --> 02:11.551
(bell dings)

02:11.800 --> 02:13.415
Thanks for meeting me
here between classes.

02:13.535 --> 02:14.650
No problem.

02:14.770 --> 02:16.685
You doing the Nigerian
medical student?

02:16.805 --> 02:18.687
Yep. First one in my village

02:18.807 --> 02:20.143
to pretend to become a doctor.

02:20.375 --> 02:22.941
Listen, the CIA's getting
serious about finding you.

02:23.061 --> 02:25.273
You need to be extra careful
with your disguises.

02:25.433 --> 02:26.628
Don't worry, Stan.

02:26.748 --> 02:29.431
I commit to my personas
down to the last detail.

02:29.551 --> 02:32.468
By the way, I just
inherited U.S. $22 million,

02:32.588 --> 02:34.436
of which I'll give you 45%

02:34.556 --> 02:36.638
if you can just wire
me the taxes up front.

02:36.758 --> 02:38.509
Thanks.
(door opens, bell dings)

02:41.380 --> 02:43.833
Oh, my God.
Scarlett Reynolds.

02:44.082 --> 02:45.864
We were in CIA boot camp together.

02:45.984 --> 02:47.533
I haven't seen her in 20 years.

02:47.653 --> 02:50.071
Oh, my God!
Coffee and a story.

02:51.990 --> 02:54.594
STAN:
<i>Man, was I in love.</i>

02:58.013 --> 02:59.895
<i>We were inseparable.</i>

03:00.015 --> 03:01.833
(rapid gunfire)

03:04.753 --> 03:07.899
<i>It was the most romantic time</i>
<i>of my life.</i>

Advertise your product or brand here

03:20.485 --> 03:22.534
Wow, Stan.
That's amazing.

03:22.654 --> 03:23.936
Why did you guys break up?

03:24.056 --> 03:25.204
Oh, none of that was real.

03:25.324 --> 03:26.538
We were at boot camp together,

03:26.658 --> 03:28.140
but everything else
was just a fantasy.

03:28.260 --> 03:29.875
Come on. Penguins don't have nipples.

03:29.995 --> 03:32.111
Anyway, I never worked up the courage

03:32.231 --> 03:33.424
to tell her I liked her.

03:33.699 --> 03:35.468
I can't say I blame you, Staniel.

03:35.628 --> 03:36.882
She's a looker.

03:37.002 --> 03:38.680
I think I'm going to ask her out.

03:38.840 --> 03:40.119
You?!

03:40.239 --> 03:42.621
You three-foot-tall, gray,
disgusting piece of (bleep)!

03:42.741 --> 03:44.156
(gasps)
Scarlett's an angel.

03:44.276 --> 03:45.357
You're a pig.

03:45.477 --> 03:46.646
She would never go for you.

03:46.806 --> 03:48.794
Listen, you, that hurts.

03:48.914 --> 03:51.613
I like to think of myself
as a pretty strong person,

03:51.733 --> 03:53.862
but you... you cracked it.

03:54.022 --> 03:55.937
Congratulations.

03:59.241 --> 04:01.375
Scones here are super flaky.

04:03.656 --> 04:05.394
Stan?

04:05.514 --> 04:06.895
Stan Smith?

04:07.015 --> 04:08.564
Who's there?
Who's that?

04:08.684 --> 04:11.033
Scarlett Reynolds,
from CIA boot camp.

04:11.153 --> 04:13.756
Oh, my God!

04:14.039 --> 04:15.854
What are you doing here?

04:15.974 --> 04:17.856
I'm in town on business.

04:17.976 --> 04:20.192
Are you still working at the CIA?

04:20.312 --> 04:21.877
Hardly working, or am I hard?

04:21.997 --> 04:23.078
I'm hard.
How are you?

04:23.198 --> 04:25.547
Great. I left the agency
after boot camp,

04:25.667 --> 04:27.683
and now I work in the private sector.

04:27.803 --> 04:29.168
(laughing):
Privates!

04:29.288 --> 04:31.170
You look great.

04:31.290 --> 04:33.188
We've got to catch up.

04:33.308 --> 04:34.673
(laughs nervously)
Yes. Yes.

04:34.793 --> 04:36.141
Come over for dinner.
(giggles)

04:36.261 --> 04:38.327
I'm married, but most people
get divorced these days.

04:38.447 --> 04:40.283
(high-pitched laughing)

04:43.018 --> 04:44.183
KLAUS:
Come on.

04:44.303 --> 04:47.018
Ooh, yeah, here we are.

04:47.138 --> 04:48.541
Damn it!

04:49.925 --> 04:51.557
Klaus, I just had the luckiest day.

04:51.677 --> 04:54.993
My hair was perfect, we had
French bread pizza at lunch,

04:55.113 --> 04:57.846
and the old black janitor
said to me, and I quote,

04:57.966 --> 05:00.833
"You lookin' fly.
Go get it now."

05:00.953 --> 05:03.035
Hard to believe the day
turned out so great,

05:03.155 --> 05:04.369
considering it started with me

05:04.489 --> 05:06.038
accidentally putting
on Hayley's panties.

05:06.158 --> 05:07.539
Hold up.

05:07.659 --> 05:10.409
Have you considered
those might be lucky panties?

05:10.529 --> 05:12.978
What, like <i>The Sisterhood</i>
<i>of the Traveling Pants,</i>

05:13.098 --> 05:14.613
but with panties instead of pants

05:14.733 --> 05:16.348
and me instead of Tibby Rollins?

05:16.468 --> 05:18.383
Ugh. Why do you say
stuff like that, man?

05:18.503 --> 05:21.620
Look, all I'm saying is,
lucky clothes are a thing.

05:21.740 --> 05:24.075
If you don't believe me,
test them out.

05:31.967 --> 05:35.463
BOTH (gasp):
Lucky panties!

05:38.223 --> 05:39.738
I hope Scarlett likes our flatware.

05:39.858 --> 05:41.123
Why wouldn't she?

05:41.243 --> 05:42.608
'Cause it sucks, Francine!

05:42.728 --> 05:44.013
We have terrible flatware!

05:44.296 --> 05:45.577
(panting)
Stan, calm down.

05:45.697 --> 05:46.945
You're so nervous.

05:47.065 --> 05:48.881
Wouldn't you be if
the love of your life

05:49.001 --> 05:50.249
was about to walk through that door?

05:50.369 --> 05:51.917
The love of your life?

05:52.037 --> 05:53.752
This girl made my knees weak,

05:53.872 --> 05:55.504
my palms sweaty, my butt leak.

05:55.624 --> 05:57.276
You ever felt that way, Francine?

05:57.542 --> 06:00.655
Stan, my feelings
are starting to get hurt.

06:00.929 --> 06:03.228
You know what? You're making me
not want to tell you things.

06:03.348 --> 06:04.263
(doorbell rings)

06:04.383 --> 06:06.133
(Stan giggling excitedly)

06:19.931 --> 06:21.843
Open it.

06:24.536 --> 06:27.348
So, Scarlett, is there
a man in your life?

06:27.572 --> 06:28.887
Or a woman?

06:29.007 --> 06:31.310
Or a big blue ma-ma-ma-ma-ma friend?

06:31.470 --> 06:33.125
Nah. I'm still single.

06:33.245 --> 06:35.027
I guess I just haven't found the one.

06:35.147 --> 06:36.728
(laughs) Hey!
Hey, you're available.

06:36.848 --> 06:38.730
And I'm not.
What a world.

06:38.850 --> 06:40.782
What a horrible world.

06:40.902 --> 06:43.552
Whew, I think I'm getting
dizzy from your wine.

06:43.672 --> 06:45.954
I think I'm getting dizzy
from your fine.

06:46.074 --> 06:47.472
(laughing)

06:47.592 --> 06:48.578
(high-pitched laughing)

06:48.794 --> 06:51.205
Oh, for God's sake.

06:52.564 --> 06:53.845
I'm going to go...

06:53.965 --> 06:56.782
Doesn't matter... you're not
paying any attention.

06:56.902 --> 06:58.250
I don't know.
Surprise me.

06:58.370 --> 06:59.338
Ugh.

06:59.571 --> 07:02.341
You ever wish
someone you know would die?

07:02.674 --> 07:06.325
♪ Wish you would step back
from that ledge, my friend ♪

07:06.445 --> 07:07.960
You would...

07:08.080 --> 07:11.229

07:24.729 --> 07:26.078
What?

07:26.198 --> 07:29.619
You wouldn't believe what
a D-bag Stan is being.

07:29.918 --> 07:32.634
He's got his old
boot camp crush down there.

07:32.754 --> 07:35.237
Those two are stuck
on each other like gum

07:35.357 --> 07:38.086
on a hot summer sidewalk
on a summer afternoon.

07:39.227 --> 07:40.542
I'm sorry.

07:40.662 --> 07:42.444
I'm taking a creative writing class,

07:42.564 --> 07:44.479
and I can't turn it off.

07:44.599 --> 07:46.581
Like a fire hydrant,

07:46.701 --> 07:49.651
gushing onto a hot summer sidewalk.

07:49.771 --> 07:52.354
My words cascading,

07:52.474 --> 07:56.158
like water onto a
hot summer sidewalk.

07:56.278 --> 08:00.429
A cat skitters by,
each step a relief,

08:00.549 --> 08:03.111
cooling its paws

08:03.271 --> 08:06.781
from the hot summer sidewalk.

08:07.956 --> 08:09.571
Oh, I know all about Scarlett.

08:09.691 --> 08:12.908
Your bastard husband told me
I was too disgusting to get her.

08:13.028 --> 08:15.177
I was so upset, I ate a donut.

08:15.297 --> 08:17.179
That's why I skipped dinner.

08:17.299 --> 08:19.047
(whispering):
I got a pizza coming.

08:19.167 --> 08:21.671
So many toppings.

08:21.831 --> 08:23.435
God, I'm pissed at Stan.

08:23.555 --> 08:25.842
He needs to be taken down a peg.

08:26.141 --> 08:28.690
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

08:28.810 --> 08:30.225
All the time, bitch.
Good.

08:30.345 --> 08:32.527
So you'll interrupt this dinner

08:32.647 --> 08:35.433
dressed in your most charming,
irresistible persona.

08:35.594 --> 08:37.687
Dan Andsome-Handsome.

08:37.953 --> 08:39.701
No woman can resist him.

08:39.821 --> 08:41.135
Whoo!

08:41.256 --> 08:43.572
Just hearing his name makes me hot.

08:43.692 --> 08:47.075
Like a hot summer sidewalk.

08:47.195 --> 08:49.544
An ice cream man saunters...

08:49.664 --> 08:50.867
Okay.

08:53.668 --> 08:55.250
Okay, Scarlett, this is ten quarters.

08:55.370 --> 08:57.319
If I can do it, you have to kiss me.

08:57.439 --> 08:58.887
(screams)
Okay, one more time.

08:59.007 --> 09:00.741
One more time.
ROGER: Sorry I'm late.

09:09.618 --> 09:12.221
Name's Dan Andsome-Handsome.

09:12.437 --> 09:14.870
You're the most stunning woman
I've ever seen.

09:14.990 --> 09:18.125
Uh... I'm Scarlett.

09:19.694 --> 09:22.244
Mmm.

09:22.364 --> 09:25.580
Let me take you out,
show you my Langley Falls.

09:25.700 --> 09:27.048
Uh, Dan, I...

09:27.168 --> 09:28.984
I hardly think Scarlett's
going to have time to...

09:29.104 --> 09:30.671
I'd love to.

09:32.274 --> 09:34.189
<i>All right, Stan,</i> <i>don't make a scene.</i>

09:34.309 --> 09:36.829
<i>Just say something witty</i>
<i>and exit on the laugh.</i>

09:36.989 --> 09:38.762
So jealous!

09:43.031 --> 09:45.026
Bye, Scarlett.
Drive safe.

09:45.146 --> 09:46.110
Great night.
Wonderful night.

09:46.230 --> 09:47.295
What the hell are you doing?

09:47.415 --> 09:48.880
Farting off part of that dinner.

09:49.000 --> 09:50.832
- What are you doing?
- You know what I'm talking about!

09:50.952 --> 09:52.100
Pretty simple, really... you told me

09:52.220 --> 09:54.202
I couldn't get her,
so I'm going to get her.

09:54.322 --> 09:55.598
Naked.

09:55.758 --> 09:57.071
All right, I-I was wrong.

09:57.191 --> 09:59.518
You can get her, but don't.
Any girl but her.

09:59.678 --> 10:01.309
You can't keep two girls on lockdown.

10:01.429 --> 10:02.794
You already got Francine.

10:02.914 --> 10:05.313
If you want to let her go,
then I'll back off Scarlett.

10:05.433 --> 10:06.781
Of course, then, I'll plow Francine.

10:06.901 --> 10:08.483
I'd let him, too.

10:08.603 --> 10:11.853
Dan Andsome-Handsome gives me
quite the wide-on.

10:11.973 --> 10:14.574
Ah... oh...

10:14.735 --> 10:15.910
But my fantasy girl.

10:16.070 --> 10:17.592
Stan, you have no right

10:17.712 --> 10:19.294
to interfere with Roger's love life.

10:19.414 --> 10:21.462
Look, Stan, you're married.
You're out of the running.

10:21.582 --> 10:24.232
And I think we both agree
that it's not all right

10:24.352 --> 10:27.402
for a girl like that to go a day
without a crispy pickle.

10:27.522 --> 10:29.337
(sighs) Fine.

10:29.457 --> 10:30.838
I won't interfere.

10:30.958 --> 10:33.074
Oh, well, I'm sorry
you're stuck with me.

10:33.194 --> 10:34.726
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

10:34.846 --> 10:36.377
Honey, no, no, don't...
don't do that.

10:36.497 --> 10:39.475
It's not all your fault.
We both said, "I do."

10:44.622 --> 10:46.354
All right, lucky panties.

10:46.474 --> 10:48.608
Work your sateen magic.

11:17.155 --> 11:19.932
Ho-ho, easy on the tush, fellas, hey.

11:20.092 --> 11:21.224
(gasps)

11:21.385 --> 11:22.807
Wh-Wh-Who took my panties,

11:22.927 --> 11:25.310
m-my women's panties
th-that I was wearing?

11:25.430 --> 11:28.165
Has anyone seen my women's
panties that I was wearing?!

11:29.310 --> 11:31.015
Snot.

11:31.135 --> 11:34.118
Without those lucky panties,
who knows what could happen?

11:34.238 --> 11:36.421
Eh, maybe I'm just being silly.

11:36.541 --> 11:37.422
Ow.

11:37.542 --> 11:38.951
A syringe?

11:39.111 --> 11:40.475
Oops, I should be more careful.

11:40.595 --> 11:41.843
I need that.

11:41.963 --> 11:44.664
I share it with everyone.

11:47.036 --> 11:48.294
What looks good to you?

11:48.454 --> 11:49.534
Don't do that.

11:49.654 --> 11:52.136
You know exactly what looks good...

11:52.256 --> 11:53.454
(inhales)

11:53.574 --> 11:57.041
... your cans and your toilet.

11:57.161 --> 11:58.876
(coughs)

11:58.996 --> 12:03.784
What do you say we skip dinner
and go straight to dessert?

12:06.003 --> 12:09.520
You... whore.

12:09.640 --> 12:10.888
Dessert sounds great.

12:11.008 --> 12:12.924
Stan, what are you doing here?

12:13.044 --> 12:14.809
Thought I'd treat
you kids to dessert.

12:14.929 --> 12:16.611
Let's see what we got here.

12:16.731 --> 12:18.279
We can eliminate
everything with dairy

12:18.399 --> 12:20.782
because it gives this guy
the green apple splatters.

12:20.902 --> 12:22.517
Um, Stan, I'm not so sure that...

12:22.637 --> 12:24.051
Oh, right, we shouldn't share forks

12:24.171 --> 12:25.703
because of your rampant mouth VD.

12:25.823 --> 12:26.904
So maybe skip dessert

12:27.024 --> 12:28.940
and each of us go
to our separate homes?

12:29.060 --> 12:30.628
(high-pitched):
May I have a word with you?

12:30.913 --> 12:32.143
You said you weren't going
to interfere.

12:32.263 --> 12:34.612
Yeah, I also said I love
to spend time with my kids.

12:34.732 --> 12:36.414
Look, there's no way
I'm letting you ruin

12:36.534 --> 12:38.844
my fantasy of Scarlett
by having sex with her.

12:39.004 --> 12:40.101
Are you challenging me?

12:40.221 --> 12:41.736
Are you a challenger?

12:41.856 --> 12:43.838
Are you challenging me to
make a <i>Challenger</i> joke?

12:43.958 --> 12:45.623
Because it's too soon and too sad

12:45.743 --> 12:47.191
and I really don't have a good one.

12:47.311 --> 12:49.594
I'm taking you home right now
and locking you in the attic.

12:49.714 --> 12:51.581
(screaming)

13:01.225 --> 13:04.525
(whimpering and crying)

13:04.645 --> 13:06.956
(continues screaming)

13:10.703 --> 13:12.800
Yo, nerds, any of you seen an alien?

13:12.920 --> 13:14.235
No, we're looking for panties.

13:14.355 --> 13:16.089
Oh, we're all looking for stuff.

13:19.443 --> 13:23.161
Hey, panty thief,
give me my panties back!

13:23.281 --> 13:24.245
Never!

13:24.365 --> 13:26.733
I love them so much!

13:28.903 --> 13:29.801
Damn it.

13:29.921 --> 13:31.105
Anybody got any ideas?

13:31.265 --> 13:32.236
I got one.

13:32.356 --> 13:33.237
(arm fart)

13:33.357 --> 13:36.610
Now, how do we market it?

13:42.783 --> 13:45.299
(slurring):
Welco-Welcome home, space lothario.

13:45.419 --> 13:47.001
You might have slept with Scarlett,

13:47.121 --> 13:48.436
but I'm wearing your robe.

13:48.556 --> 13:49.537
Ha!

13:49.657 --> 13:51.372
Hey, that's my pooping robe.

13:51.492 --> 13:53.419
I can tell by all the
poop on the edges.

13:53.579 --> 13:54.809
And while I'm being candid,

13:54.929 --> 13:57.756
I did not make the acquaintance
of Scarlett's insides.

13:57.916 --> 13:59.964
Ha, she wouldn't let you sleep
with her, huh?

14:00.084 --> 14:01.010
Attagirl.

14:01.170 --> 14:03.000
Oh, no, she was begging me for it,

14:03.120 --> 14:04.802
but I decided it wasn't
quite the right setting.

14:04.922 --> 14:05.848
Setting?

14:06.008 --> 14:07.972
You know your ski chalet fantasy?

14:08.092 --> 14:09.574
That's where I want to do it.

14:09.694 --> 14:12.510
I want to take your dream girl
into your dream setting

14:12.630 --> 14:14.356
and plow her in real life.

14:14.516 --> 14:15.680
You wouldn't.

14:15.800 --> 14:17.215
Oh, but I would.

14:17.335 --> 14:19.417
I'm gonna do it like this.
(grunts)

14:19.537 --> 14:20.551
And then I'm gonna do it like this.

14:20.671 --> 14:21.652
(grunts)

14:21.772 --> 14:23.070
And then it's her turn.

14:23.190 --> 14:26.459
A-boom-boom-boom-boom-
boom-boom-boom-boom-boom.

14:31.867 --> 14:34.782
Shannon Sharpe, sharpening a machete,

14:34.902 --> 14:37.270
gonna catch an alien
and eat some spaghetti.

14:38.839 --> 14:40.805
(knocking)

14:40.925 --> 14:43.407
Hold on, spaghetti,
I got to get that.

14:43.527 --> 14:44.859
Shannon Sharpe?

14:44.979 --> 14:46.661
If you want to catch the alien,

14:46.781 --> 14:49.115
I know where you can find him.

14:51.652 --> 14:53.601
Hey, that's my spaghetti.

14:53.721 --> 14:55.722
This is the first I'm hearing of it.

15:01.188 --> 15:02.903
Oh, man, this is exciting.

15:03.023 --> 15:04.538
Gonna catch my first alien.

15:04.658 --> 15:07.458
So, uh, what do you think
the CIA will do

15:07.578 --> 15:09.161
with the alien when you bring it in?

15:09.321 --> 15:12.413
Oh, they're going to dissect him
like a frog, like Kermit.

15:12.533 --> 15:14.317
That's probably my favorite frog.

15:15.619 --> 15:17.801
Hey, if you get a runny nose,

15:17.921 --> 15:19.503
I've got napkins in the glove box.

15:19.623 --> 15:20.804
Every time I go to Wendy's,

15:20.924 --> 15:23.409
I grab a handful of
those yellow napkins.

15:26.463 --> 15:28.262
Klaus, what's going on?

15:28.382 --> 15:30.097
I'm moving into Roger's attic.

15:30.217 --> 15:32.184
Stan turned him over
to an alien hunter.

15:32.344 --> 15:33.018
Wh-What?

15:33.178 --> 15:34.418
Yeah, he was super P.O.'d

15:34.538 --> 15:36.353
about Roger taking Scarlett
away for the weekend...

15:36.473 --> 15:37.788
careful with that box!

15:37.908 --> 15:40.324
You hold it precariously
and I am distrustful.

15:40.444 --> 15:41.659
Thank you, Rico.

15:41.779 --> 15:43.227
<i>Gracias, Rico.</i>

15:43.347 --> 15:46.049
How's your wife's
Looney Tunes jean jacket?

15:49.403 --> 15:51.568
Just like in my fantasy.

15:51.688 --> 15:52.903
You go on ahead, Stan,

15:53.023 --> 15:55.005
I'm just waterproofing
my snakeskin boots.

15:55.125 --> 15:57.668
I won't be but a minute.

15:57.828 --> 16:00.087
Get off of her, you gross, gray arf!

16:00.247 --> 16:02.012
Where's Rog... Dan?

16:02.132 --> 16:03.464
He's... in the back.

16:03.584 --> 16:04.698
What are you doing here?

16:04.818 --> 16:06.200
Hey, Stan, look at my boots.

16:06.320 --> 16:08.002
The water just beads up.

16:08.122 --> 16:10.020
Aw, damn, Scarlett?

16:10.140 --> 16:11.288
Hello, Shannon.

16:11.408 --> 16:13.107
Wait, you two know each other?

16:13.227 --> 16:14.775
Of course I know this fine lady.

16:14.895 --> 16:16.143
Best alien hunter around,

16:16.263 --> 16:18.897
but not today 'cause
that alien is mine.

16:19.057 --> 16:19.813
What?

16:19.933 --> 16:22.359
No, th-there must be some mistake.

16:22.519 --> 16:23.611
(groans)

16:23.771 --> 16:25.355
There's no mistake.

16:27.274 --> 16:29.809
Oh, boner, not now.

16:32.654 --> 16:33.410
Oh...

16:33.530 --> 16:35.412
Panties, oh, panties.

16:35.532 --> 16:36.764
Steve, what are you doing?

16:36.884 --> 16:39.883
I-I accidentally wore your
panties the other day...

16:40.003 --> 16:41.919
the really cute pair
with the lace job?

16:42.039 --> 16:44.605
When I wore them, I had
the best luck of my life,

16:44.725 --> 16:45.973
but then Snot stole them.

16:46.093 --> 16:47.676
Aw, Snot has them?

16:47.836 --> 16:49.276
Yeah, now I need another pair.

16:49.396 --> 16:50.679
I need my luck back!

16:50.839 --> 16:51.712
(sighs)

16:51.832 --> 16:53.948
Look, Steve, remember on <i>The Smurfs</i>

16:54.068 --> 16:56.050
when Wimpy Smurf
wasn't feeling very strong

16:56.170 --> 16:58.485
and Papa Smurf made him
a magic courage potion?

16:58.605 --> 16:59.688
Of course.

16:59.848 --> 17:01.689
And remember it worked,
but then in the end,

17:01.809 --> 17:04.590
Papa Smurf admitted
it wasn't magic at all?

17:04.711 --> 17:06.694
It was just regular old
Smurf Berry Jam.

17:06.855 --> 17:08.028
Classic episode.

17:08.147 --> 17:10.698
Steve, those panties weren't lucky.

17:10.818 --> 17:12.199
It was the confidence they gave you

17:12.319 --> 17:13.767
that made you feel lucky.

17:13.887 --> 17:15.135
Hey, and guess what.

17:15.255 --> 17:19.807
That confidence is in... side... you.

17:19.926 --> 17:22.041
Oh, thanks, Hayley.

17:22.162 --> 17:25.064
(chuckling):
All right, run along now.

17:32.055 --> 17:33.437
(kicks down door)

17:33.557 --> 17:37.141
I have had the worst luck
since I lost those panties.

17:37.261 --> 17:39.353
Give 'em back, you son of a bitch!

17:39.513 --> 17:40.896
(gasps, mumbles)

17:41.056 --> 17:42.915
Oh, hell, no.

17:43.183 --> 17:43.864
(mumbling)

17:43.984 --> 17:45.234
(screams)

17:45.394 --> 17:46.402
(both grunting)

17:46.562 --> 17:48.471
(gurgling screams)

17:49.690 --> 17:52.574
(Hayley screams, Snot groans)

17:52.734 --> 17:55.409
(pained groaning)

17:55.529 --> 17:56.870
(snap)

17:57.030 --> 17:58.695
Give 'em to me.

17:58.815 --> 17:59.682
(spits)

18:01.827 --> 18:02.566
(groans)

18:02.686 --> 18:04.601
That was amazing.

18:04.721 --> 18:07.824
Those are the luckiest panti
in the world.

18:09.084 --> 18:10.968
(wind whistling)

18:11.128 --> 18:13.053
You're an alien hunter?

18:13.213 --> 18:14.311
That's right.

18:14.431 --> 18:16.513
I purposefully ran into you
at the coffee shop

18:16.633 --> 18:18.882
'cause I knew you had the alien.

18:19.002 --> 18:21.729
Why else would I even give you
the time of day?

18:21.889 --> 18:22.586
Really?

18:22.706 --> 18:24.288
You're a loser.

18:24.408 --> 18:25.939
You were a nobody at the academy

18:26.059 --> 18:27.508
and you're a nobody now,

18:27.628 --> 18:30.944
and you saw me kill someone
so now I'm going to kill you.

18:31.064 --> 18:33.547
Oh, man, you are the worst right now.

18:33.667 --> 18:36.617
I can't believe I spent all
those years pining after you.

18:36.737 --> 18:39.553
Well, allow me to erase that memory.

18:39.673 --> 18:41.055
Go ahead, shoot me.

18:41.175 --> 18:42.156
You're trash.

18:42.276 --> 18:43.690
I have the best wife at home.

18:43.810 --> 18:47.161
She's terrific, she's sexy,
she's smart but not very.

18:47.281 --> 18:49.965
Lady, my wife blows you away.

18:50.125 --> 18:51.717
Damn right I do.

18:51.877 --> 18:52.760
Francine?

18:52.920 --> 18:55.686
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

18:55.806 --> 18:58.140
(screams)

18:58.300 --> 18:59.056
Oh, my God.

18:59.176 --> 19:01.325
Wow, she was really dry.

19:01.445 --> 19:03.127
Oh, Francine, I'm so sorry

19:03.247 --> 19:04.661
for being such a sack of beans,

19:04.781 --> 19:06.029
fantasizing over Scarlett.

19:06.149 --> 19:07.464
No, it's okay.

19:07.584 --> 19:09.400
Sometimes I like to fantasize

19:09.520 --> 19:12.002
you're a group
of angry construction workers

19:12.122 --> 19:13.637
when we're making love.

19:13.757 --> 19:15.272
But what woman doesn't look back

19:15.392 --> 19:17.541
on her first time with fondness?

19:17.661 --> 19:18.909
(both moan)

19:19.029 --> 19:21.879
To think I almost turned Roger
into the CIA.

19:21.999 --> 19:23.680
Shannon Sharpe said
they were gonna dissect...

19:23.800 --> 19:24.748
ROGER:
Help!

19:24.868 --> 19:26.210
(gasps)
Roger!

19:26.370 --> 19:28.235
Oh, gross!
(horrified scream)

19:28.355 --> 19:29.388
Roger!

19:31.158 --> 19:34.608
Hey, can you guys put me back
together before I die over here?

19:34.728 --> 19:35.928
Preesh.

19:36.088 --> 19:38.881
♪ ♪

20:08.370 --> 20:11.080
♪ ♪

20:14.292 --> 20:16.552
(wind whistling)

20:16.712 --> 20:17.918
Thanks for saving me, dudes.

20:18.038 --> 20:20.354
So when did you realize
Scarlett was an alien hunter?

20:20.474 --> 20:22.641
Took a little longer
than I'd prefer to admit.

20:22.801 --> 20:25.259
For a while, I just thought
we were having super-kinky sex,

20:25.379 --> 20:26.979
and then she cut off my face.

20:27.139 --> 20:29.563
Sorry for interfering
with your love life, pal.

20:29.683 --> 20:32.432
Yeah, I'm sorry for going
after your fantasy girl.

20:32.552 --> 20:34.220
Come on, let's go home.

20:36.239 --> 20:38.172
You guys go ahead,

20:38.292 --> 20:39.706
I'm gonna make
the Shannon Sharpe thing

20:39.826 --> 20:41.911
look like a suicide.

20:57.002 --> 20:58.909
Yeah, it's pretty clear
what happened here.

20:59.029 --> 21:01.478
This man shot himself,
fell against the painting,

21:01.598 --> 21:02.646
then took out a knife.

21:02.766 --> 21:03.814
Back to the office, boss?

21:03.934 --> 21:05.782
Uh-uh, it's movie time.

21:05.902 --> 21:07.436
Are you serious?

21:07.596 --> 21:09.730
Am I dialing Moviefone right now?

21:09.890 --> 21:11.101
Yes!

21:11.221 --> 21:13.442
