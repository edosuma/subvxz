WEBVTT

01:26.654 --> 01:28.924
Our air. Be careful.

01:29.958 --> 01:32.828
So, this is
my dive instructor, Jackson.

01:36.064 --> 01:37.698
Whoo!
You're a natural!

01:41.837 --> 01:45.340
- Oh, that's nice.
- I don't remember it tasting that nice.

01:47.408 --> 01:50.645
- I forgot you filmed all this.
- I know. So cute.

01:50.778 --> 01:52.981
- See? I can dance.
- Yeah, when you're drunk.

01:53.115 --> 01:56.018
- I wasn't that drunk.
- Mm-hmm.

01:58.086 --> 02:01.823
Mmm.

02:06.560 --> 02:08.096
Why do I have to leave?

02:08.229 --> 02:10.497
You don't. Just stay.

02:10.631 --> 02:12.267
No. You know I can't.

02:13.068 --> 02:15.070
You know I stole
all your underwear?

02:15.837 --> 02:17.738
You can't show up at
your fancy new job commando.

02:17.873 --> 02:20.441
- You took all of it?
- Yeah, all of it.

02:20.574 --> 02:22.110
I feel like my firm
would encourage it.

02:22.244 --> 02:24.745
It would help new employees
loosen up or something.

02:25.713 --> 02:27.249
- It's progressive.
- It is progressive.

02:27.382 --> 02:30.218
I mean, they let me defer this
offer for this entire year

02:30.352 --> 02:31.386
so I could be here.

02:31.519 --> 02:33.088
My boss is badass.

02:33.221 --> 02:35.290
Please let me give you a ride
to the airport.

02:35.424 --> 02:36.825
- No.
- Why not?

02:38.592 --> 02:39.727
I don't like goodbyes.

02:39.861 --> 02:41.930
Well, great, me neither.
Let's not.

02:42.064 --> 02:44.199
Oh, great. So you're coming?

02:44.833 --> 02:47.035
Been there,
got the corporate T-shirt.

02:47.169 --> 02:48.804
It's not my vibe.

02:51.873 --> 02:54.508
Seriously, I'm happy here.
Just look at the ocean.

02:56.044 --> 02:58.246
Got everything I could
possibly want right here.

02:58.380 --> 02:59.815
Except me.

03:03.584 --> 03:06.154
Aw, look at your face.

03:06.288 --> 03:07.956
You are so cute.

03:08.522 --> 03:10.758
You are so cute.

03:12.260 --> 03:13.895
Let's have one more drink.

03:16.630 --> 03:18.000
Okay.

03:18.499 --> 03:19.734
Okay.

03:26.241 --> 03:28.410
Did you really take
any of my clothes?

03:28.542 --> 03:29.744
Some dirty socks.

03:29.878 --> 03:32.546
You are so weird.

03:32.680 --> 03:34.983
Hey, Jez. Two more beers.

03:39.821 --> 03:41.823
Thanks. Back in a sec.

04:58.666 --> 05:01.369
- Hello?
- <i>Sara! I can't wait to see you.</i>

05:01.503 --> 05:04.306
I know.
I'm so excited. It's so soon.

05:04.439 --> 05:07.008
- <i>I know it. What time do you land?</i>
- I think elevenish.

05:07.142 --> 05:09.044
<i>I pick you up from the airport?</i>

05:09.177 --> 05:11.913
No. Pascale, you are the bride.
No. You're not picking me up.

05:12.047 --> 05:14.916
<i>Well, I was hoping
you could run some errands.</i>

05:15.050 --> 05:17.718
Yeah, of course.
Maid of honor, at your service.

05:18.220 --> 05:19.821
- Can I borrow the truck?
- <i>Beh, oui.</i>

05:19.955 --> 05:21.123
- <i>It's all yours.</i>
- Really?

05:22.557 --> 05:25.060
<i>I'm so excited
for you to get here.</i>

06:00.395 --> 06:01.930
No, thank you.

06:44.139 --> 06:45.739
Hello?

06:46.774 --> 06:48.176
Hello?

06:56.618 --> 06:57.652
Shit.

07:09.097 --> 07:12.000
Nitro. Come here, boy.

07:12.367 --> 07:13.501
Get in there.

07:15.537 --> 07:16.905
Solomon.

07:17.038 --> 07:21.910
Sara. Well.
Sneaking in to steal my stuff?

07:30.452 --> 07:31.620
Thank you.

07:32.654 --> 07:35.657
- Now don't be mixing that with Coke.
- Obviously not.

07:36.191 --> 07:37.892
It's the good stuff.

07:39.027 --> 07:40.395
It's like rocket fuel.

07:42.063 --> 07:44.466
- Have you seen him yet?
- What?

07:44.966 --> 07:47.068
Who could you possibly
be talking about?

07:47.836 --> 07:50.338
Even though I've missed you,
you still have to pay.

07:52.440 --> 07:53.441
Of course.

07:54.442 --> 07:56.211
I'll be back to see you
again soon.

07:56.344 --> 07:58.947
Your soon is much,
much longer than mine.

07:59.080 --> 08:02.984
Yeah, but your rum is the
only reason I ever come back here, so...

08:03.118 --> 08:04.653
Yeah, right.

08:05.987 --> 08:08.423
- Thanks, Solomon.
- Anytime.

08:36.217 --> 08:38.053
You're insane.

08:38.520 --> 08:40.388
- You wanna head down and get a drink?
- Yeah.

08:40.522 --> 08:42.823
- Yeah? Cool.
- Yes, so let's go.

08:44.459 --> 08:45.927
- No.
- My wedding, my rules.

08:46.061 --> 08:47.262
- No, absolutely not.
- Come on.

08:47.395 --> 08:49.731
- No way. No way. No way.
- For me.

08:49.864 --> 08:50.899
Whoo-hoo!

08:51.032 --> 08:54.269
I'm getting married tomorrow!

09:19.527 --> 09:21.429
Mmm.

09:24.666 --> 09:25.934
I love it here so much.

09:26.067 --> 09:28.103
Nine times out of ten

09:28.236 --> 09:31.439
when I close my eyes,
this is what I see.

09:31.841 --> 09:33.375
I should get married
more often.

09:33.508 --> 09:35.610
And by the way, I'm never
staying in a hotel again.

09:35.744 --> 09:37.011
Oh!

09:37.145 --> 09:38.146
I cannot believe this place

09:38.279 --> 09:39.481
belongs to you and Vincent.

09:39.614 --> 09:41.817
- It is unbelievable.
- Thank you.

09:41.950 --> 09:44.452
- Pascale, congratulations.
- Ohh.

09:44.586 --> 09:46.254
I should've had
the wedding here.

09:46.388 --> 09:49.290
But Rodrigues is beautiful too.
It's quiet.

09:50.024 --> 09:52.427
- Only a couple of hours by boat.
- Yeah.

09:52.560 --> 09:53.561
No tourists.

09:54.162 --> 09:55.563
Apart from you.

09:55.697 --> 09:57.565
I am not a tourist.
You can't call me that.

09:57.699 --> 09:59.934
I had a Mauritius
driver's license

10:00.068 --> 10:02.103
and I survived
an entire year here, okay?

10:02.237 --> 10:04.606
That means I'm officially
no longer a tourist.

10:07.609 --> 10:10.245
And you don't want to stay?
Not this time?

10:14.549 --> 10:16.551
You can't do your job
from here?

10:17.252 --> 10:19.087
What is it you call yourself?
A brand...

10:19.220 --> 10:20.789
Senior brand strategist.

10:20.922 --> 10:21.857
Mmm.

10:21.990 --> 10:23.258
I will have you know,

10:23.391 --> 10:25.059
it is actually
a big, important job.

10:25.193 --> 10:27.195
It's very important.
I have a whole... I have a laptop.

10:27.328 --> 10:29.631
I have business cards.

10:29.764 --> 10:31.166
I'm so impressed.

10:31.299 --> 10:34.602
Seriously, though, it's...
Well, it's, um...

10:35.103 --> 10:36.404
It...

10:37.472 --> 10:40.642
Oh, my God.
Do not turn around.

10:41.676 --> 10:44.646
You are so...
Why would you turn around?

10:45.848 --> 10:47.182
Is that him?

10:47.315 --> 10:49.451
- <i>Beh, oui.</i>
- <i>Beh, oui.</i>

10:49.584 --> 10:52.153
- Are you serious?
- He has the dive school next door.

10:52.287 --> 10:54.255
- No, he does not.
- Yes, he does.

10:54.389 --> 10:56.491
Right here? Pascale,
why didn't you tell me?

10:56.624 --> 10:58.894
I didn't think I was gonna see
him until the wedding tomorrow.

10:59.027 --> 11:00.830
You'll be seeing him
at the party tonight.

11:00.962 --> 11:02.197
- No.
- Yeah.

11:02.330 --> 11:03.731
When was this gonna come up?

11:03.866 --> 11:05.133
You told me
to tell you nothing.

11:05.266 --> 11:07.502
I mean, I would've liked
a warning or...

11:07.635 --> 11:10.205
And who's that?
Who's he with?

11:10.338 --> 11:13.074
Oh, it's, uh, his dive friend.

11:13.208 --> 11:16.377
Oh, my God. Does he have
to look like that?

11:17.378 --> 11:18.513
That's aggressive.

11:20.014 --> 11:21.951
- Pascale.
- You want to hide?

11:22.083 --> 11:24.052
Yeah. I do.

11:59.254 --> 12:01.756
- What are you looking at?
- Oh. Busted.

12:01.891 --> 12:06.227
Nothing. I'm just...
just deciding when to do this.

12:08.129 --> 12:10.933
Okay. Well, wish me luck.

12:14.402 --> 12:15.136
So...

12:15.270 --> 12:16.671
Hey.

12:17.739 --> 12:18.740
Hey.

12:21.342 --> 12:23.278
When did you get here?
I didn't see you...

12:24.279 --> 12:25.313
Like, half an hour.

12:25.446 --> 12:27.215
Oh. I would've looked for you.

12:27.348 --> 12:29.584
Um, you look great.

12:30.518 --> 12:32.620
- Yeah, you too.
- Oh, thank you.

12:32.754 --> 12:34.957
I'm actually glad I'm
seeing you because I just...

12:35.089 --> 12:37.659
I didn't want it to be awkward
this weekend at the wedding.

12:37.792 --> 12:40.029
No, no, no. Why would it be?

12:40.161 --> 12:42.730
Yeah. Yes, totally.

12:52.007 --> 12:54.242
I gotta go close up
some paperwork.

13:01.616 --> 13:02.750
Oh, shut up.

13:08.857 --> 13:10.258
Hey, wait up.

13:12.527 --> 13:14.562
Are you still
in the beach house?

13:15.330 --> 13:18.232
- Yeah.
- I'll walk you halfway.

13:19.167 --> 13:20.468
No, thanks.

13:20.936 --> 13:23.338
- Come on, it's just up there.
- Hey, <i>salope!</i>

13:23.471 --> 13:28.376
The ferry leaves at 7:30!
You miss it, I'll kill you!

13:28.509 --> 13:29.611
I know!

13:32.580 --> 13:34.883
Well, this is something
you don't get in London.

13:35.683 --> 13:36.651
How is it, then?

13:36.784 --> 13:38.453
It's good.
I mean, it's insane,

13:38.586 --> 13:40.421
but it's really good, yeah.

13:41.222 --> 13:42.992
Okay, I think
this is about halfway.

13:43.124 --> 13:45.293
No, it's not.
It's a third, maybe more.

13:48.196 --> 13:49.731
Your friends are leaving.

13:52.333 --> 13:54.369
I'll catch up with them later.

13:59.540 --> 14:02.811
I think you know
how much I hate goodbyes.

14:04.278 --> 14:05.713
Yeah, I know.

14:20.762 --> 14:21.796
Sorry.

14:23.164 --> 14:24.399
Oh. Solomon's.

14:27.102 --> 14:28.670
- Good luck.
- Chin-chin.

14:36.111 --> 14:38.346
Yup.

14:40.281 --> 14:42.350
Jackson, it is kind of amazing

14:42.483 --> 14:44.218
what you've done here,
honestly.

14:44.853 --> 14:47.455
Guess some of that ambition
of yours rubbed off.

14:52.727 --> 14:54.930
It's the wrong way
round, dumbass.

14:55.064 --> 14:56.698
Is it, though?

14:56.832 --> 14:58.466
I don't think it is.

14:58.834 --> 15:02.336
- I think it's perfect.
- Oh, yeah, it looks fabulous.

15:02.470 --> 15:05.773
Yeah, my life is preserved.

15:10.278 --> 15:11.312
Try this.

15:12.346 --> 15:14.950
- This is the right way round.
- I know it's the right way round.

15:15.084 --> 15:17.618
- And if you want to inflate it...
- Which I don't want to do.

15:17.752 --> 15:19.988
- Which I may just have to do...
- Jackson!

15:20.122 --> 15:22.124
Jackson, no!

15:22.256 --> 15:23.859
No!

15:23.992 --> 15:26.527
No! That is not okay.

15:27.096 --> 15:28.163
That is dangerous.

15:32.266 --> 15:33.568
Stop!

15:48.316 --> 15:49.550
Jackson...

15:56.390 --> 15:58.093
What do you want, Sara?

15:58.827 --> 16:01.830
Nothing. I... I missed you.

16:03.297 --> 16:04.532
That's all.

16:11.006 --> 16:12.174
I don't...

16:12.306 --> 16:14.143
What?

16:14.275 --> 16:15.710
This.

16:16.577 --> 16:18.546
What's the point,
if you're just going to leave again?

16:19.148 --> 16:23.317
Jackson, I was always gonna leave.
You knew that. I had to go.

16:23.451 --> 16:24.987
You didn't have to.

16:25.120 --> 16:26.855
- You can live wherever you want.
- Yes, I guess, technically.

16:26.989 --> 16:28.723
- It's a choice.
- I can live wherever I want.

16:28.857 --> 16:30.725
- You always have a choice.
- You are such a hypocrite.

16:30.859 --> 16:32.627
How is it a choice
if it's all on your terms?

16:32.760 --> 16:34.362
What if I didn't want this?

16:35.296 --> 16:36.531
Okay.
Well, then, there you go.

16:36.664 --> 16:38.233
Was I supposed to move here

16:38.366 --> 16:39.968
and, like, become
your shop assistant?

16:40.102 --> 16:42.303
- Not my shop assistant.
- If you cared about me so much,

16:42.436 --> 16:44.807
you could've offered to come with me.
It's a two-way street.

16:44.940 --> 16:48.409
And choke in some high-rise
in London? Forget that.

16:48.911 --> 16:50.711
I'm sorry
I wanted more than this.

16:50.846 --> 16:54.983
I wasn't content to just float
around in a perpetual gap year.

16:58.486 --> 16:59.687
Okay.

17:00.122 --> 17:01.455
This isn't going anywhere.

17:01.589 --> 17:03.624
Okay, you know what?

17:03.758 --> 17:06.460
Let's promise we're not gonna make
things awkward at the wedding tomorrow.

17:06.594 --> 17:08.429
I want Pascale
to have a nice day.

17:08.729 --> 17:11.032
You know, it's probably better
if we just don't talk then.

17:11.165 --> 17:12.400
That's a great idea.

17:12.532 --> 17:13.868
- Brilliant.
- Perfect.

17:14.002 --> 17:15.037
- Sweet.
- Great.

17:15.170 --> 17:16.238
- Perfect.
- Fine.

17:16.805 --> 17:18.506
- Excellent.
- Stop talking.

17:18.638 --> 17:20.309
- You stop talking.
- Shut up.

17:20.441 --> 17:21.944
You shut up.

18:15.730 --> 18:17.966
Shit, shit, shit, shit.

18:35.483 --> 18:36.484
Hi, bride-to-be.

18:36.617 --> 18:38.020
Sara? Where are you?

18:38.153 --> 18:39.453
We've been waiting for you
for half an hour.

18:39.587 --> 18:40.621
<i>I know. I'm really sorry.</i>

18:40.755 --> 18:42.858
I overslept just a little bit,

18:42.991 --> 18:45.760
- but it's gonna be okay.
- We cannot wait any longer.

18:45.894 --> 18:48.663
- <i>What happened? Did you sleep with him?</i>
- Um, maybe.

18:48.796 --> 18:50.665
- <i>Sara!</i>
- I know. I know, I know.

18:50.798 --> 18:52.700
Uh, it was, um...

18:53.434 --> 18:55.003
- <i>Well?</i>
- It was...

18:55.137 --> 18:56.771
- <i>Sara, you said...</i>
- I know. I know.

18:56.905 --> 18:59.141
<i>You told yourself
you wouldn't, Sara.</i>

18:59.274 --> 19:01.977
<i>Look, where are you?
Is he there with you now?</i>

19:02.110 --> 19:03.544
No, no, he's not.

19:03.678 --> 19:05.646
<i>You do realize
this is the only ferry</i>

19:05.780 --> 19:07.983
<i>to Rodrigues today, right?</i>

19:08.116 --> 19:09.151
Shit.

19:14.856 --> 19:17.159
Pick up, pick up, pick up.

19:21.997 --> 19:23.031
Wyman.

19:23.497 --> 19:24.732
Freddy, hi.

19:24.866 --> 19:26.667
Are you flying
to Rodrigues today?

19:26.802 --> 19:28.469
<i>Of course, for the wedding.</i>

19:28.602 --> 19:30.172
Thank God. Can I come with you?

19:30.305 --> 19:32.673
<i>Sure, but I'm leaving
in five minutes sharp.</i>

19:32.808 --> 19:35.344
I'll be there in ten.
Don't you dare go without me.

19:43.018 --> 19:46.121
Leaving in five minutes,
my ass.

19:47.289 --> 19:49.458
What? I can't hear you.

19:49.590 --> 19:50.558
Yeah, yeah.

19:53.462 --> 19:56.497
- You're late.
- It's good to see you too, Freddy Wyman.

19:56.630 --> 19:58.532
And you are looking
a little...

20:00.534 --> 20:02.871
underdressed,
for a wedding guest.

20:03.005 --> 20:04.505
Unlike you. By the way,

20:04.638 --> 20:05.907
I'm really glad
you have your sunglasses

20:06.041 --> 20:07.708
'cause I'm changing
on the plane.

20:07.843 --> 20:10.578
Hi.

20:10.711 --> 20:13.748
Ohh.

20:13.882 --> 20:15.951
Oh, Freddy.

20:16.084 --> 20:18.854
Nothing a little
rum and ginger can't fix.

20:18.987 --> 20:20.255
Good.

20:20.389 --> 20:24.092
Well, I see you got
Solomon's rocket fuel here.

20:24.226 --> 20:27.561
- Yup.
- Ah. Best rum on the island.

20:27.695 --> 20:29.530
Yeah, I know.
Don't get any ideas, though.

20:29.663 --> 20:31.466
All of this makes it
to the wedding, Freddy.

20:31.599 --> 20:32.800
- I know Pascale don't play.
- Yeah.

20:32.934 --> 20:34.503
Thank you for taking
all that abuse.

20:34.635 --> 20:37.339
And thank you for giving me a ride.
You are a life-saver.

20:37.472 --> 20:40.976
Don't think you're special.
You're not the only passenger.

20:41.343 --> 20:43.577
No VIPs here on this trip.

20:45.047 --> 20:46.381
Okay.

20:46.515 --> 20:48.283
Wyman, man,
did you fix that hatch?

20:48.417 --> 20:53.055
Well, you're welcome to fix it
anytime you like.

20:55.490 --> 20:57.893
Hit and run again, huh? Nice.

20:59.227 --> 21:00.262
Fuck.

21:01.163 --> 21:03.597
Gentle with her.
She's an old girl.

21:03.731 --> 21:05.800
There you go.

21:07.436 --> 21:08.870
Ahh.

21:09.004 --> 21:10.604
This is your captain
welcoming you

21:10.738 --> 21:11.873
to Wyman Air Flight 227.

21:12.007 --> 21:13.674
Our approximate flying time

21:13.809 --> 21:15.776
is going to be 99 minutes.

21:15.911 --> 21:18.080
Ain't nothing but ocean
all the way.

21:18.213 --> 21:21.615
Now, it's gonna get loud
up in here,

21:21.749 --> 21:24.119
so, uh, put on your headsets,

21:24.252 --> 21:26.754
in case you want
a little tête-à-tête.

21:30.125 --> 21:32.194
Hey, Freddy,
after the wedding,

21:32.327 --> 21:34.762
you wanna go check out
that reef outside Rodrigues?

21:34.896 --> 21:36.697
- Sure, man.
- You should also go

21:36.832 --> 21:38.867
to the place
that we used to take...

21:39.968 --> 21:41.903
Tower, come in.

21:42.037 --> 21:44.940
This is WA227 requesting
permission for takeoff.

21:45.073 --> 21:47.809
<i>Come in, 227.
Freddy, how you doing?</i>

21:47.943 --> 21:51.779
Just looking forward to some
barbecued ribs and a piña colada.

21:51.913 --> 21:53.448
Will we see you
at the wedding?

21:53.582 --> 21:55.951
<i>I wish I could, buddy,
but duty calls. Enjoy.</i>

21:56.084 --> 21:57.986
<i>227, you're cleared
for takeoff.</i>

21:58.120 --> 21:59.321
Off we go.

22:23.812 --> 22:26.982
Westward heading
coming right up.

22:37.893 --> 22:39.127
Sara.

22:39.828 --> 22:41.062
Sara.

22:44.765 --> 22:46.201
Can you hear me now?

22:46.334 --> 22:47.335
Loud and clear.

22:48.904 --> 22:52.073
Sara, come on up here and sit
with me in the copilot seat.

22:52.673 --> 22:54.109
For old times' sake.

22:54.242 --> 22:56.044
Freddy,
you're gonna want me to fly

22:56.178 --> 22:57.846
and I'm too hungover to do that.

22:57.979 --> 22:59.915
Get up here.

23:05.487 --> 23:09.257
<i>WA227, you're leaving our zone.
Have a good flight.</i>

23:09.391 --> 23:11.092
All right.
See you later, Sammy.

23:11.526 --> 23:12.760
Out.

23:19.901 --> 23:22.971
So, how's life treating you?

23:24.306 --> 23:25.307
You got a fella?

23:25.440 --> 23:27.676
We're going to talk
about this already?

23:27.809 --> 23:29.044
Uh, yeah.

23:29.477 --> 23:31.446
Uh, okay.

23:35.150 --> 23:37.519
Yeah, I'm dating.
But there's...

23:38.119 --> 23:41.256
- There's nothing, really.
- Mm-hmm.

23:42.557 --> 23:44.725
Well...

23:46.461 --> 23:49.730
- How are you?
- I miss her every day.

23:50.632 --> 23:52.400
Longest year of my life.

23:52.901 --> 23:54.436
I'm so sorry.

23:55.403 --> 23:57.405
I'm sorry I wasn't there
when it happened.

23:57.539 --> 23:58.573
Don't be.

23:59.574 --> 24:03.345
You were made for each other.
I can't imagine how hard it's been.

24:05.180 --> 24:07.415
You learn to live
with the pain.

24:07.949 --> 24:09.750
Love isn't being
made for each other.

24:09.884 --> 24:12.254
It's being willing
to make things work.

24:13.488 --> 24:14.956
You gotta want it.

24:15.624 --> 24:17.359
It was never easy
with Eleanor.

24:17.492 --> 24:18.960
Oh, my God, no.

24:24.633 --> 24:26.301
So, you ready to give it a go?

24:26.434 --> 24:29.070
No. I can't believe you think I'm
gonna remember how to do this.

24:29.204 --> 24:32.140
Come on. There's nothing you
could do that I can't correct.

24:33.708 --> 24:37.212
Look, make sure that the
altimeter stays below 20,000 feet.

24:37.345 --> 24:39.314
Because you know what happens
at 20,000 feet.

24:39.447 --> 24:42.150
Yes, altitude sickness. Yeah, I remember.

24:44.986 --> 24:46.288
Look, ma!

24:47.956 --> 24:49.424
There's nothing
to crash into up here.

24:49.557 --> 24:51.926
I know. But, Freddy,
you said you'd be good.

24:52.060 --> 24:53.495
Look, you were a natural.

24:53.628 --> 24:55.397
I need an heir to my fortune.

24:56.731 --> 24:58.533
I'm gonna turn off
the autopilot.

24:59.934 --> 25:02.070
Now, if you don't
grab that yoke,

25:02.203 --> 25:06.341
you'll have about 20 seconds before
she'll start to veer off course.

25:07.242 --> 25:08.443
- Freddy.
- Grab that yoke.

25:08.576 --> 25:10.045
- No.
- And make sure

25:10.178 --> 25:12.280
that the horizon
stays level, right here.

25:14.949 --> 25:16.551
Don't be a defeatist.

25:19.054 --> 25:21.956
You always were
a bullheaded one.

25:25.293 --> 25:28.330
You okay?

25:29.798 --> 25:31.900
- You sure?
- Uh-huh.

25:32.033 --> 25:34.002
Can I get you something?

25:36.271 --> 25:37.305
Freddy?

25:40.375 --> 25:42.143
- Are you okay?
- Uh-huh.

25:42.577 --> 25:45.046
- Where are your pills?
- I need... I need water.

25:45.180 --> 25:46.848
Okay, where do I get you
some water?

25:47.315 --> 25:49.150
- In the back.
- In the back? Okay.

25:49.484 --> 25:50.518
Hey, Jackson!

25:52.654 --> 25:53.988
Okay. It's okay.

25:54.656 --> 25:57.559
Jackson!
He's having a heart attack.

25:57.692 --> 25:59.361
He needs water for his meds.

25:59.494 --> 26:00.528
Quick!

26:02.130 --> 26:03.264
Here, here, here.

26:03.398 --> 26:05.166
Take these.
Take these. Take these.

26:05.835 --> 26:07.969
It's okay.
It's okay. It's okay.

26:08.103 --> 26:09.637
Jackson, hurry!

26:19.849 --> 26:22.050
Jackson,
pull him off the yoke!

26:24.886 --> 26:26.955
Look out!

26:30.925 --> 26:32.660
Pull him off the yoke!

26:37.899 --> 26:39.334
Shit!

26:40.870 --> 26:42.704
- Oh, my God!
- Sara, pull us up!

26:42.838 --> 26:44.606
I'm trying!

26:44.739 --> 26:46.541
- Come on!
- I can't.

26:46.674 --> 26:47.877
Hold him.

26:48.009 --> 26:49.978
Come on. Pull us up!
What are you doing?

26:50.111 --> 26:52.447
Sara, you can do it.

26:52.848 --> 26:54.516
- Oh, God!
- Pull us up!

27:18.973 --> 27:21.042
- Is he breathing?
- I don't know.

27:26.080 --> 27:27.415
- Okay, Freddy.
- Help him.

27:27.549 --> 27:30.485
- Do CPR. Do something.
- There's no pulse.

27:33.721 --> 27:35.156
Come on.

27:37.525 --> 27:39.527
- Come on.
- Come on, please.

27:41.563 --> 27:42.597
Come on.

27:43.298 --> 27:46.201
Four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine.

27:46.334 --> 27:48.203
- Come on.
- Please. Please.

27:48.336 --> 27:50.906
Four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine, ten.

27:51.039 --> 27:53.675
- Freddy?
- No, no, no.

27:56.846 --> 27:58.079
Come on!

27:59.915 --> 28:02.584
Five, six, seven, eight,
nine, ten.

28:04.552 --> 28:06.187
Freddy, man.

28:13.461 --> 28:14.596
Sorry.

28:18.633 --> 28:20.001
Oh, Freddy.

28:42.624 --> 28:44.492
No. No.

29:04.779 --> 29:06.180
Can you fly this plane?

29:07.850 --> 29:09.150
No.

29:10.318 --> 29:11.854
But you're doing it right now.

29:11.987 --> 29:15.824
I mean, I took a few lessons,
but it was years ago, okay?

29:16.524 --> 29:18.426
Put on your seat belt.

29:20.863 --> 29:23.731
Okay. Is everything
still working?

29:26.001 --> 29:28.037
Jackson, the GPS is broken.

29:28.436 --> 29:30.371
Our phones have GPS.

29:31.840 --> 29:35.276
Oh, shit. Mine's dead.
Let me see yours.

29:40.214 --> 29:41.449
Nothing.

29:43.953 --> 29:45.921
- The radio.
- Oh. Yes.

29:46.055 --> 29:47.890
Hello. Can anyone hear me?

29:48.023 --> 29:50.525
Please come in. This is an emergency.
We have no pilot.

29:50.658 --> 29:54.162
This is a distress call.
I repeat, this is a distress call.

29:54.295 --> 29:55.530
Try another frequency.

29:56.397 --> 29:58.299
If you can hear me,
if anyone is listening,

29:58.433 --> 30:00.335
please, it's an emergency.

30:01.804 --> 30:03.771
- What about shortwave?
- What good is shortwave?

30:03.906 --> 30:05.206
Just try it.

30:05.340 --> 30:06.608
Hello. Please come in.
Please come in.

30:06.741 --> 30:08.309
Our pilot
has had a heart attack.

30:08.443 --> 30:10.012
We don't even know
which direction we're going in.

30:10.144 --> 30:12.747
We have no idea where we are.
We could really use some help.

30:12.881 --> 30:16.517
So please, please,
please come in if you can hear us, please.

30:18.553 --> 30:21.456
It's okay. Someone heard it.
Someone's gotta be out there.

30:27.228 --> 30:28.463
Autopilot.

30:29.130 --> 30:30.698
Autopilot.

30:30.833 --> 30:33.501
Freddy should've programmed it
to fly us to Rodrigues.

30:33.635 --> 30:35.904
Then we can worry about
the landing when we get there.

30:57.926 --> 30:59.460
Wait. No, no, no, no, no.

30:59.594 --> 31:01.496
It shouldn't be doing that.

31:04.133 --> 31:07.669
Freddy said it starts to list
after 20 seconds of manual.

31:08.837 --> 31:11.239
God, Jackson, what if
the autopilot's broken?

31:15.110 --> 31:17.378
How much fuel do we have?
It's right there.

31:18.513 --> 31:21.116
- Half a tank.
- That should be enough, right?

31:21.249 --> 31:22.684
Not if we're lost.

31:24.786 --> 31:28.289
So, we have no pilot,
no autopilot, no GPS.

31:29.791 --> 31:32.627
And neither of us
can land a plane.

31:40.102 --> 31:41.402
I can't see any sign of land.

31:41.536 --> 31:43.471
The compass.
Is the compass broken?

31:44.106 --> 31:45.107
No, I don't think so.

31:45.740 --> 31:47.675
Which direction
were we heading in before?

31:47.810 --> 31:50.378
Um, west. We were heading west.

31:50.511 --> 31:52.881
- Okay.
- So we just need to turn 90 degrees.

31:53.949 --> 31:56.350
- No, no, no, wait, turn back.
- Why?

31:56.484 --> 31:59.721
Because west from here isn't the same
as west from where we were before.

31:59.855 --> 32:01.990
- Could take us even further out to sea.
- Shit, you're right.

32:02.124 --> 32:06.694
So we took off at 8:40,
and we got spun around at 9:20.

32:06.995 --> 32:10.165
And it's 9:30 right now.
Which means we've been flying north...

32:10.298 --> 32:11.232
That's ten minutes.

32:11.365 --> 32:13.102
So we can do a 180,

32:13.234 --> 32:14.903
head south
for exactly ten minutes.

32:15.037 --> 32:17.672
And then head west. And that
should get us back to the mainland.

32:18.239 --> 32:19.373
Okay.

32:19.507 --> 32:21.342
- I'm setting a timer.
- Good.

32:21.476 --> 32:22.911
You ready?
I'm gonna turn around now.

32:23.045 --> 32:25.246
Yes, south for ten minutes.
Then we turn west.

32:25.379 --> 32:27.615
Okay. Heading south now.

32:55.878 --> 32:58.679
Holy shit. Look at that.

33:04.418 --> 33:05.988
We'll fly right past it.

33:09.490 --> 33:11.592
How much longer?

33:12.194 --> 33:13.728
We're almost there.

33:14.495 --> 33:16.597
Looks like it's moving.
It's everywhere.

33:16.731 --> 33:19.400
Can't we somehow go around it?

33:24.973 --> 33:27.708
<i>227, come in.</i>

33:27.843 --> 33:30.311
- Hello?
- <i>227, come in. Freddy.</i>

33:30.444 --> 33:33.849
- We're here. Can you hear me?
- <i>Roger, 227. We can hear you.</i>

33:33.982 --> 33:35.716
Hello, yes, we're here.

33:35.851 --> 33:38.386
<i>Can you please identify
your aircraft? Do you copy?</i>

33:38.519 --> 33:40.155
This is 227.

33:40.289 --> 33:41.857
<i>Who am I speaking to?</i>

33:41.990 --> 33:43.992
This is Sara Johnson
and Jackson Davisen.

33:44.126 --> 33:46.360
We are passengers on flight 227.

33:46.494 --> 33:48.163
We were headed to Rodrigues.

33:48.297 --> 33:50.331
There's a storm in front of us.
Our pilot is dead.

33:50.464 --> 33:53.101
We don't know where we're going.
We could really use your help.

33:53.235 --> 33:54.702
<i>Freddy Wyman is dead?</i>

33:57.206 --> 33:58.974
Yes, he had a heart attack.

33:59.274 --> 34:00.541
It's just us up here.

34:02.244 --> 34:04.880
<i>Sara, are you the one
flying the plane?</i>

34:05.013 --> 34:08.851
Yeah, Freddy took me up with him
a couple of times two years ago.

34:08.984 --> 34:11.253
But that's it.
I've never been up here solo.

34:11.385 --> 34:12.719
You can get us
out of this, right?

34:12.855 --> 34:14.455
<i>You've still got her
in the air,</i>

34:14.589 --> 34:16.424
<i>so keep doing
what you are doing.</i>

34:16.556 --> 34:18.260
<i>Sara, my name is Samuel,</i>

34:18.391 --> 34:20.829
<i>and I'm going to try
and help you, okay?</i>

34:20.963 --> 34:22.396
<i>How much fuel do you have?</i>

34:22.530 --> 34:23.563
How much fuel?

34:24.065 --> 34:25.800
Thirty-five percent left
in the main tank.

34:25.934 --> 34:28.136
We have about 35 percent left
in the main tank.

34:28.270 --> 34:30.504
Samuel, you're breaking up
a little bit.

34:30.638 --> 34:33.108
<i>Can you please try to give me
some details about your location?</i>

34:33.242 --> 34:34.810
<i>I haven't got you
on my screen here.</i>

34:34.943 --> 34:37.145
Yeah, we've turned around.
We're about...

34:38.512 --> 34:40.983
fifty-five minutes
from where we took off.

34:41.116 --> 34:43.717
Maybe you can use the storm
to locate us, though.

34:46.255 --> 34:49.091
Samuel, please come in.

34:49.224 --> 34:50.926
No, no, Samuel, don't do this.

34:51.059 --> 34:53.027
Samuel? Hello!

34:53.161 --> 34:56.664
It's okay. He's gonna be able to
work out our location. It'll be fine.

34:57.132 --> 34:58.166
Samuel!

34:59.500 --> 35:01.136
<i>I can see the storm.</i>

35:01.270 --> 35:02.703
If you keep flying south,

35:02.838 --> 35:05.207
<i>you will run the risk
of running out of fuel.</i>

35:05.340 --> 35:09.077
<i>You have to turn west to reach land.
Do you understand? Copy.</i>

35:14.082 --> 35:16.417
Did you just say to turn west
into the storm?

35:16.919 --> 35:19.154
<i>Yes. West is your
quickest route to land.</i>

35:19.288 --> 35:21.890
<i>The storm is too big
to fly around.</i>

35:22.391 --> 35:25.559
Samuel, is there any way
we could land on the water?

35:25.693 --> 35:27.762
How am I supposed to land on the water?
I've never even landed on land.

35:27.896 --> 35:29.463
I don't know. I'm just asking.

35:29.597 --> 35:31.666
<i>No, no, do not land
on the water.</i>

35:31.799 --> 35:33.601
<i>No, do not attempt
to land on the water.</i>

35:33.734 --> 35:35.203
<i>You will crash and sink.</i>

35:35.337 --> 35:37.272
<i>We'll have no way
of locating you.</i>

35:37.406 --> 35:40.775
<i>Please keep flying west
until you reach land.</i>

35:40.909 --> 35:43.412
<i>Don't worry.
Keep the aircraft level...</i>

35:43.544 --> 35:44.712
Samuel!

35:46.114 --> 35:47.748
He'll be back.
It's just the storm.

35:48.083 --> 35:50.185
- He said to go west.
- Are you serious?

35:51.153 --> 35:52.586
West?

35:54.222 --> 35:55.824
That's what he said.

36:33.395 --> 36:35.663
I think you should be sitting
in the pilot's seat.

36:35.796 --> 36:37.265
- Really?
- Yeah.

36:37.399 --> 36:39.234
You need to see the dials.

36:39.368 --> 36:40.601
Let's switch.

36:57.252 --> 36:58.286
Shit.

37:02.623 --> 37:07.062
- Samuel said to stay at the same altitude.
- You gotta be kidding me.

37:11.099 --> 37:12.566
You can do this.

37:13.601 --> 37:15.971
The problem is,
what if I can't?

37:22.077 --> 37:25.313
This is insane. We are not
flying through this.

37:28.450 --> 37:30.919
Oh, God.

37:34.890 --> 37:36.425
Sara, what are you doing?

37:36.557 --> 37:38.160
I'm going over it.

37:38.827 --> 37:40.195
Are you crazy?

37:41.695 --> 37:44.032
Samuel said to go through it.

37:45.733 --> 37:47.601
You don't even know
what's above it.

37:47.735 --> 37:50.105
Uh, clear skies.
That's what I'm hoping.

37:51.540 --> 37:52.941
No, no, Sara, don't do this.

37:53.075 --> 37:54.876
Sara, please.

37:55.010 --> 37:56.144
Come on!

37:57.012 --> 37:58.612
We're going too high. Sara!

37:58.746 --> 38:01.349
I just wanna get out.
Let's get out of it.

38:06.121 --> 38:08.857
Jesus, it's huge.

38:20.202 --> 38:21.635
Sara!

38:47.562 --> 38:48.629
You're too high.

38:50.899 --> 38:53.667
Whoa. You're too high.

38:56.338 --> 38:58.874
We're getting altitude sickness.
We need to fly lower.

38:59.007 --> 39:02.643
Oh, the dials are
sort of moving.

39:04.712 --> 39:05.947
I'm fine.

39:09.584 --> 39:10.819
Oh! Sara!

39:15.723 --> 39:17.425
Sara, wake up!

39:18.293 --> 39:19.327
Come on!

39:32.240 --> 39:34.309
- Why are we falling?
- I don't know.

39:34.442 --> 39:36.344
I've lost control.
Nothing's working.

39:36.478 --> 39:38.914
I told you
we should have stayed lower!

39:39.047 --> 39:41.249
Getting lower
isn't the problem!

39:41.749 --> 39:45.187
Samuel, come in!
Mayday! Mayday!

39:46.388 --> 39:47.656
Mayday! Mayday!

39:54.728 --> 39:58.967
- I can't see anything. I can't...
- I'm gonna be sick!

40:21.189 --> 40:24.259
Oh!

40:31.900 --> 40:33.134
Sara, are you okay?

40:34.236 --> 40:37.239
Wh... Where are we heading?
Which direction are we going?

40:39.074 --> 40:42.911
- I don't know. The compass is smashed.
- Well, that's just great.

40:44.212 --> 40:46.548
We need to head west
or we're gonna fly in circles.

40:46.681 --> 40:48.083
I'll be right back.

40:49.584 --> 40:51.319
What are you doing?

41:00.962 --> 41:03.932
- Hold on.
- Will you just tell me what you're doing?

41:04.065 --> 41:06.434
I think I remember
how to make a compass.

41:06.835 --> 41:08.236
Really?

41:20.382 --> 41:23.585
If you magnetize a needle
and float it in liquid,

41:23.718 --> 41:25.220
it should point north.

41:25.353 --> 41:26.787
For real?

41:32.327 --> 41:34.562
Holy shit.
This is actually working.

41:34.696 --> 41:35.864
Really?

41:38.233 --> 41:39.167
Shit.

41:39.301 --> 41:41.169
- Did you see it?
- That's north.

41:41.303 --> 41:43.204
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

41:43.338 --> 41:45.907
- That's west?
- Yeah.

41:49.711 --> 41:52.547
Sounds like the whole
engine is ripping apart.

42:01.356 --> 42:03.792
Oh, thank God, Sara.

42:07.295 --> 42:10.031
You did it.

42:21.343 --> 42:24.346
I never should have
gotten on this plane.

42:25.046 --> 42:28.083
If you hadn't,
I'd be dead by now, so...

42:29.784 --> 42:31.219
thanks.

42:38.059 --> 42:39.961
Samuel, do you copy?

42:40.095 --> 42:42.564
Samuel.

42:43.665 --> 42:45.800
If you can hear us,
we made it through the storm.

42:45.934 --> 42:47.869
We're heading west,
looking for land.

42:49.805 --> 42:51.973
Samuel.

42:52.808 --> 42:54.476
Maybe they can hear us.

42:55.410 --> 42:56.444
I don't know.

42:58.880 --> 43:01.616
Just fly west, like he said.

43:01.750 --> 43:03.418
Yeah, until we find land.

43:04.018 --> 43:05.520
Yeah, and then what?

43:32.747 --> 43:36.886
The fuel. Five percent?
Jackson, it was at 35 before the storm.

43:37.018 --> 43:38.553
Five percent?

43:50.098 --> 43:52.434
Wait. I think I can switch
between the tanks.

43:59.040 --> 44:00.375
Ha!

44:00.508 --> 44:03.378
Oh, I was so scared
for a second there.

44:04.412 --> 44:05.680
Whew.

44:13.354 --> 44:15.356
Fuel gauges go down. That's...

44:16.391 --> 44:18.828
- Not that fast.
- Yeah, but it's just...

44:18.960 --> 44:21.729
It's adjusting from
the transfer. It'll settle.

44:24.232 --> 44:25.467
It'll settle.

44:28.570 --> 44:29.504
Shit.

44:29.637 --> 44:31.539
- There's gotta be a leak.
- Shit.

44:31.673 --> 44:33.809
There's two tanks, right?
Where are they?

44:33.943 --> 44:35.410
They're out there
on the wings.

44:35.543 --> 44:37.947
There's gotta be a leak
in one of the tanks

44:38.079 --> 44:39.047
or the fuel lines or...

44:39.180 --> 44:40.448
Remember that screeching sound

44:40.582 --> 44:42.050
under the hood
during the storm?

44:42.183 --> 44:43.718
Maybe something
broke loose in there

44:43.853 --> 44:45.086
and caused some damage.

44:47.789 --> 44:49.390
Jackson, what's that look?

44:49.892 --> 44:52.060
Jackson, what are you thinking?
I know that look.

44:52.193 --> 44:54.395
I'm gonna have to go outside.

44:56.832 --> 44:58.666
- Of the plane?
- Yeah.

44:59.835 --> 45:02.604
- Wait. What? Are you serious?
- At the rate that's dropping,

45:02.737 --> 45:05.139
we'll be out of fuel
in about 15 minutes.

45:05.273 --> 45:07.208
Jackson,
we don't go outside the plane!

45:07.342 --> 45:09.777
That is so dangerous. I can't
believe you're even talking about it.

45:09.912 --> 45:12.447
Look, if we run out of fuel,
we're finished, okay?

45:12.580 --> 45:14.482
You could fall,
you could unbalance the plane

45:14.616 --> 45:15.951
and we could both, you know...

45:16.084 --> 45:17.585
The wind could blow you off,

45:17.719 --> 45:19.721
or you could get out there
and not even be able to open it.

45:19.855 --> 45:22.624
Do I have to keep listing
the ways that this is stupid?

45:22.757 --> 45:24.392
There. Better?

45:48.951 --> 45:50.251
Can you slow us down?

45:59.962 --> 46:01.462
That's as much as I can do.

46:56.852 --> 46:58.252
Oh, my God!

46:59.855 --> 47:01.422
Be careful!

47:01.556 --> 47:02.858
No shit!

47:17.006 --> 47:18.506
Jackson!

47:29.717 --> 47:31.820
Come on, Jackson. You can do it.

47:54.076 --> 47:55.811
Come on. Come on. Come on.

48:00.983 --> 48:02.216
Come on, come on.

48:07.156 --> 48:08.389
Come on.

48:23.271 --> 48:26.574
Come on. Just stick, just stick!

48:26.708 --> 48:29.777
Jackson, it's working!
It's leveling out!

48:42.390 --> 48:43.658
Jackson!

48:47.228 --> 48:48.629
Sara!

48:49.530 --> 48:51.133
I can't hold on!

48:51.566 --> 48:53.801
Sara, my arm!

48:54.402 --> 48:55.804
- Help me!
- Jackson!

48:55.938 --> 48:57.405
Hold on tight, okay?

48:57.538 --> 48:59.141
Put your foot on the wheel.

48:59.273 --> 49:01.676
I'm trying!

49:05.881 --> 49:08.316
Can you jump?

49:10.819 --> 49:11.987
Hold on!

49:17.525 --> 49:19.260
I'll be right there!

49:21.063 --> 49:22.563
Okay, okay, okay.

49:26.601 --> 49:28.436
Jackson!

49:28.569 --> 49:29.872
Jackson, take my hand!

49:30.371 --> 49:32.573
- Can you jump?
- The rope's wrapped around the wheel.

49:33.474 --> 49:35.543
We need to cut the rope.
Cut the rope.

49:35.676 --> 49:37.946
There's a wire
cutter in the back of the plane.

49:41.049 --> 49:42.283
Okay.

49:43.185 --> 49:47.256
Come on, Jackson. Look at me.
You can do it. Come on.

49:47.388 --> 49:48.957
- Take my hand.
- Okay.

49:51.994 --> 49:53.628
Okay. Ready?

49:56.131 --> 49:59.268
One, two, three.

50:22.891 --> 50:24.659
Oh, my God.

50:26.494 --> 50:28.629
Okay.

50:29.330 --> 50:30.731
Okay.

50:37.005 --> 50:38.040
Come on.

50:41.542 --> 50:45.446
Okay. Hey, hey, sit up. Sit up.

50:49.417 --> 50:50.986
Are you okay?

50:51.119 --> 50:52.221
Are you okay?

50:52.353 --> 50:55.123
Jackson, look at me.
Are you okay?

50:55.623 --> 50:58.861
- My ar... My a-a-arm.
- What's that? What happened?

50:59.161 --> 51:00.829
Oh, my God! Holy shit.

51:00.963 --> 51:02.331
Don't look, don't look,
don't look.

51:02.463 --> 51:04.599
Jacks... Okay, hey, hey, hey.

51:04.732 --> 51:06.801
Hey, stay here. Stay with me.

51:06.935 --> 51:10.839
It's not that bad.
I'm gonna find a way to clean it, okay?

51:11.472 --> 51:12.506
Stay here.

51:13.275 --> 51:16.812
- I'll be right here.
- Yeah, you will. Okay, yeah.

51:40.302 --> 51:42.403
You're crazy! Stop! Stop!

51:42.536 --> 51:44.373
God!

51:44.505 --> 51:47.309
Okay, for this next part,
I think I'm supposed to distract you.

51:47.441 --> 51:49.912
No, please don't, please don't.
I just wanna focus.

51:50.045 --> 51:52.613
Okay, I'm gonna let you focus.
I just wanna tell you

51:52.747 --> 51:54.415
that I keep having flashbacks
to last night.

51:54.548 --> 51:55.817
What? Which part?

51:59.922 --> 52:01.722
Oh, my God.
That must have hurt so much.

52:01.857 --> 52:03.691
I can't believe I just did that.

52:05.693 --> 52:07.996
Be careful.

52:09.630 --> 52:10.598
Careful, careful.

52:10.731 --> 52:12.968
You're fine. You're fine.

52:16.872 --> 52:18.673
That was amazing
what you just did.

52:20.208 --> 52:22.978
So stupid, but so amazing.

52:23.477 --> 52:27.149
I assume you're still talking
about last night.

52:39.593 --> 52:40.929
How does that feel?

52:41.629 --> 52:43.198
Thank you, Doctor.

52:47.535 --> 52:49.905
That's very unprofessional,
Doctor.

53:08.857 --> 53:10.691
What does the gauge say?

53:11.994 --> 53:14.595
Five percent and holding.

53:15.063 --> 53:16.530
For now.

53:17.899 --> 53:20.735
Let's hope it keeps us
flying till we find land.

53:24.605 --> 53:26.540
Maybe we can lighten the plane.

53:26.674 --> 53:29.144
Buy ourselves some time,
burn less fuel.

53:30.611 --> 53:34.016
- Do you think the seats come out?
- That could work.

54:08.549 --> 54:10.218
The door's stuck!

54:18.827 --> 54:21.029
- That do anything?
- Well, it's holding.

54:22.264 --> 54:24.266
Did you clear everything?

54:24.698 --> 54:25.934
Um...

54:42.117 --> 54:43.717
I'll do it.

54:45.153 --> 54:47.856
You just keep
the plane steady, okay?

55:04.306 --> 55:06.341
- Jackson!
- Sorry! Sorry, sorry.

55:57.526 --> 55:59.027
Goodbye, Freddy.

56:34.963 --> 56:36.398
We had to.

56:37.999 --> 56:40.135
It was the right thing to do.

56:45.040 --> 56:46.875
How are we doing on fuel?

56:51.046 --> 56:52.780
We're running out of time.

56:54.683 --> 56:56.784
Okay, just keep looking
for land.

56:58.086 --> 57:00.754
- I'll get rid of these.
- Wait.

57:02.190 --> 57:04.359
It's Solomon's rocket fuel,
right?

57:05.694 --> 57:07.062
It's ethanol.

57:07.195 --> 57:09.831
I mean, couldn't it
be used as plane fuel?

57:09.965 --> 57:11.566
That could work, couldn't it?

57:11.700 --> 57:13.068
It's worth a try, right?

57:14.102 --> 57:16.004
Shit, the fuel valve is outside.

57:16.137 --> 57:18.039
It's on top of the wing.

57:20.842 --> 57:23.612
Okay, I'll climb up,
you pass me the bottles.

57:23.744 --> 57:26.081
- No.
- It'll give us time, Sara.

57:26.214 --> 57:28.250
Come on, grab the yoke.

57:28.383 --> 57:30.118
Absolutely not.

57:33.588 --> 57:34.623
Couldn't I do it?

57:34.755 --> 57:35.724
No.

57:35.857 --> 57:37.292
I think I could do it.

57:37.425 --> 57:39.894
It was a stupid idea.
It's not worth it.

57:42.697 --> 57:44.332
I actually think it might be.

57:57.946 --> 57:59.780
With this, we have five.

58:05.820 --> 58:09.291
There's a bar on top of the door
that you could use to climb up.

58:12.894 --> 58:14.129
Sara...

01:00:53.688 --> 01:00:56.458
Jackson! Quick!

01:01:00.295 --> 01:01:01.629
You got this, Sara.

01:01:22.784 --> 01:01:25.119
No! Damn it!

01:01:28.858 --> 01:01:30.158
Jackson!

01:01:33.495 --> 01:01:35.730
I need another bottle, quick.

01:01:45.540 --> 01:01:46.674
Come on.

01:02:01.824 --> 01:02:03.057
Come on.

01:02:14.870 --> 01:02:16.671
Come on!

01:02:18.807 --> 01:02:20.041
Come on.

01:02:27.482 --> 01:02:28.750
Jackson!

01:02:28.884 --> 01:02:30.451
Another one.

01:02:48.971 --> 01:02:50.305
Come on.

01:03:02.717 --> 01:03:04.385
Come on, come on.

01:03:16.297 --> 01:03:19.068
Oh, my God.
Sara, there's an island.

01:03:19.500 --> 01:03:21.736
- Is that an island?
- I can't hear you!

01:03:22.203 --> 01:03:23.939
Give me another bottle.

01:03:24.073 --> 01:03:25.874
I can't hold on much more.

01:03:26.608 --> 01:03:29.444
We only got
one more to go after that.

01:03:43.191 --> 01:03:44.592
Shit!

01:03:49.731 --> 01:03:50.966
Shit!

01:03:51.532 --> 01:03:54.502
That's it, Sara.
We're out of bottles.

01:03:54.970 --> 01:03:56.671
Get back in.

01:04:15.858 --> 01:04:19.694
Sara! It's working.
It's actually working.

01:04:20.361 --> 01:04:22.430
Yes!

01:04:23.197 --> 01:04:24.666
That was incredible.

01:04:25.800 --> 01:04:27.168
You're amazing.

01:04:31.439 --> 01:04:32.674
We're running on rum.

01:04:34.043 --> 01:04:35.710
You're a genius.

01:04:40.481 --> 01:04:43.085
- Sara, I think I saw an island.
- What?

01:04:43.217 --> 01:04:45.553
- An island.
- What, like Rodrigues?

01:04:45.687 --> 01:04:48.991
No, it was tiny, but I think
it was enough to land on.

01:04:49.457 --> 01:04:52.961
You think? Because, well,
if you're not sure,

01:04:53.095 --> 01:04:55.196
then we should really
just keep going, right?

01:04:55.329 --> 01:04:56.899
I have a feeling
we should turn around.

01:04:57.032 --> 01:04:59.300
- I think it might be our only chance.
- Yeah?

01:04:59.701 --> 01:05:01.269
We still don't have much fuel.

01:05:01.402 --> 01:05:04.505
So if we turn around,
that's it, no going back.

01:05:20.155 --> 01:05:21.756
I think we should turn around.

01:05:22.223 --> 01:05:23.524
I trust you.

01:05:38.974 --> 01:05:41.375
Here. I need to wrap this up
a little more.

01:05:53.188 --> 01:05:54.789
Thanks.

01:06:03.899 --> 01:06:07.568
Samuel, we're turning around
and flying east.

01:06:07.702 --> 01:06:09.104
We're retracing our path.

01:06:09.238 --> 01:06:11.606
We saw an island
a few minutes ago to the...

01:06:11.739 --> 01:06:13.108
- What direction?
- North.

01:06:13.242 --> 01:06:14.742
To the north.

01:06:15.376 --> 01:06:16.845
I hope you can hear this.

01:07:45.133 --> 01:07:47.535
That's five minutes.
I don't see anything.

01:07:48.237 --> 01:07:51.807
It has to be here. It's here.
Where are you?

01:08:04.920 --> 01:08:06.021
Please.

01:08:12.361 --> 01:08:13.628
No.

01:08:14.462 --> 01:08:15.696
No.

01:08:35.082 --> 01:08:36.417
This can't be it.

01:08:36.984 --> 01:08:38.618
This can't be it.
This can't be it.

01:08:38.752 --> 01:08:41.055
This can't be it.
I don't want this to be it.

01:08:45.294 --> 01:08:47.694
How long do you think
we can glide for?

01:09:03.345 --> 01:09:05.113
Jackson, I'm so sorry.

01:09:06.982 --> 01:09:08.116
For what?

01:09:10.419 --> 01:09:13.154
For everything. For leaving.

01:09:13.889 --> 01:09:15.823
If I hadn't left,
we would never be here.

01:09:15.957 --> 01:09:18.926
No, Sara, don't be stupid.
Of course you left.

01:09:21.562 --> 01:09:22.997
I'm sorry.

01:09:24.299 --> 01:09:25.765
I should have listened to you.

01:09:25.901 --> 01:09:28.736
I should have just listened
to what you needed.

01:09:29.670 --> 01:09:31.206
I was being selfish.

01:09:32.341 --> 01:09:33.841
We both were.

01:09:41.082 --> 01:09:43.751
Why do you hate
saying goodbye so much?

01:09:44.987 --> 01:09:48.223
Honestly, I think
I'm terrified because...

01:09:50.791 --> 01:09:52.727
...you make me wanna stay.

01:09:58.300 --> 01:09:59.633
Holy shit.

01:10:03.238 --> 01:10:04.373
Ah!

01:10:04.505 --> 01:10:06.574
You were right! Oh, my...

01:10:06.875 --> 01:10:08.477
Jackson! Oh.

01:10:08.609 --> 01:10:10.812
- I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
- Oh, shit.

01:10:11.246 --> 01:10:13.714
Oh, my God. Okay. Okay.

01:10:14.182 --> 01:10:16.885
Now I just have to figure out
how to land the plane.

01:10:38.106 --> 01:10:39.174
Shit.

01:10:39.474 --> 01:10:41.009
Okay.

01:10:41.977 --> 01:10:44.813
It's gonna be okay.
Just let us glide in.

01:10:45.847 --> 01:10:46.948
How do we do this?

01:10:47.082 --> 01:10:48.749
- It's gonna be fine.
- How?

01:10:48.884 --> 01:10:51.019
- Just keep us as high as you can.
- Okay.

01:10:59.727 --> 01:11:01.695
Samuel,
we're attempting to land.

01:11:01.830 --> 01:11:03.798
I repeat,
we're attempting to land.

01:11:04.632 --> 01:11:06.168
Shit.

01:11:06.902 --> 01:11:08.970
You gotta pull us up
a little bit.

01:11:09.104 --> 01:11:10.138
Okay.

01:11:15.310 --> 01:11:17.778
It's not responding.
I can't lift it.

01:11:18.547 --> 01:11:20.215
I can't tell how high we are.

01:11:22.050 --> 01:11:23.751
- Two hundred feet.
- Oh, no.

01:11:23.885 --> 01:11:25.520
It's not gonna work.
I can't get a grip on...

01:11:25.653 --> 01:11:27.022
It's gonna be okay.

01:11:27.155 --> 01:11:29.723
Just keep it steady.
Try to keep it steady.

01:11:31.093 --> 01:11:33.661
Hundred and fifty feet.

01:11:39.167 --> 01:11:40.801
One hundred.

01:11:44.372 --> 01:11:45.606
Fifty feet.

01:11:47.542 --> 01:11:49.444
Just lift us
at the last moment.

01:11:49.578 --> 01:11:50.545
I'm trying!

01:11:50.678 --> 01:11:52.613
No, we're too low.

01:11:52.746 --> 01:11:54.282
Brace yourself, Sara.

01:12:35.723 --> 01:12:38.126
Jackson!

01:12:39.194 --> 01:12:41.630
Jackson, wake up! Jackson!

01:12:41.762 --> 01:12:43.265
Wake up!

01:12:43.398 --> 01:12:45.267
Jackson!

01:13:41.323 --> 01:13:42.490
Jackson!

01:13:45.227 --> 01:13:46.428
Jackson!

01:13:52.167 --> 01:13:53.335
Jackson!

01:15:09.978 --> 01:15:11.313
Jackson!

01:16:01.329 --> 01:16:03.131
Come on, Jackson. Come on.

01:16:04.065 --> 01:16:05.867
Come on.

01:16:09.070 --> 01:16:10.638
Oh, thank God.

01:16:25.053 --> 01:16:26.321
Hey.

01:16:27.155 --> 01:16:29.057
We made it.

01:16:34.729 --> 01:16:36.364
We made it.

01:16:59.654 --> 01:17:00.890
Jackson.

01:17:01.456 --> 01:17:04.225
Jackson, wake up.
The water's coming in.

01:17:05.627 --> 01:17:07.662
We have to move.
The sea's coming.

01:17:10.665 --> 01:17:12.367
It's just a sandbar.

01:17:14.335 --> 01:17:16.337
It'll disappear with the tide.

01:17:18.573 --> 01:17:19.607
No.

01:17:37.625 --> 01:17:39.027
Fuck!

01:18:22.270 --> 01:18:24.840
- I'm so tired.
- I know.

01:18:24.974 --> 01:18:26.541
I need water.

01:18:26.674 --> 01:18:27.775
It's okay.

01:18:42.624 --> 01:18:45.293
What are we gonna do?
What are we gonna do?

01:18:46.294 --> 01:18:47.629
What are we gonna do?

01:19:16.157 --> 01:19:18.793
Jackson, we're gonna die
out here, aren't we?

01:19:34.375 --> 01:19:36.077
I'm gonna die.

01:19:43.251 --> 01:19:44.619
You're gonna be okay.

01:19:45.320 --> 01:19:48.323
- I want you to take the life vest.
- No.

01:19:48.456 --> 01:19:50.491
- Take the life vest and put it on.
- No, no, no.

01:19:50.625 --> 01:19:53.695
- Just unclip it, please.
- No. No. No.

01:19:53.829 --> 01:19:56.664
- Not the time to be stubborn.
- I'm staying right here.

01:19:57.732 --> 01:19:58.766
We're a team.

01:20:02.704 --> 01:20:04.873
Whatever happens,
I am with you.

01:20:23.926 --> 01:20:25.259
I love you.

01:20:25.861 --> 01:20:27.161
I love you.

01:20:29.965 --> 01:20:31.666
I love you so much.

01:21:00.495 --> 01:21:02.730
Oh, my God.
It's a boat.

01:21:02.865 --> 01:21:04.198
Help!

01:21:16.577 --> 01:21:18.346
Over here!

01:21:19.781 --> 01:21:22.084
Hey! Hey! Hey!

01:21:44.205 --> 01:21:45.573
Get him first. He's hurt.

01:22:09.263 --> 01:22:10.798
Thank you. Thank you.

01:22:10.933 --> 01:22:13.634
Voilà.

01:22:22.111 --> 01:22:23.377
No more goodbyes.

01:22:23.511 --> 01:22:26.347
No. No more goodbyes.
